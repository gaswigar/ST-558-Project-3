this
book
is
to
the
memory
of
my
mother
who
was
at
once
mother
sister
friend
to
all
christian
women
and
men
of
whatever
creed
or
name
who
bound
by
church
or
state
have
not
dared
to
think
for
themselves
to
all
persons
who
breaking
away
from
custom
and
the
usage
of
ages
dare
seek
truth
for
the
sake
of
truth
to
all
such
it

be

preface
this
work
explains
itself
and
is
given
to
the
world
because
it
is
needed
tired
of
the
obtuseness
of
church
and
state
indignant
at
the
injustice
of
both
towards
woman
at
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
of
humanity
by
the
other
half
in
the
name
of
religion
finding
appeal
and
argument
alike
met
by
the
assertion
that
god
designed
the
subjection
of
woman
and
yet
that
her
position
had
been
higher
under
christianity
than
ever
before
continually
hearing
these
statements
and
knowing
them
to
be
false
i
refuted
them
in
a
slight
the
subject
at
the
annual
convention
of
the
national
woman
suffrage
association
washington
a
wish
to
see
that
speech
in
print
having
been
expressed
it
was
allowed
to
appear
in
national
a
woman
suffrage
paper
i
then
edited
and
shortly
afterwards
in
the
history
of
woman
suffrage
of
which
i
was
also
an
editor
the
kindly
reception
given
both
in
the
united
states
and
europe
to
that
meager
chapter
of
forty
pages
confirmed
my
purpose
of
a
fuller
presentation
of
the
subject
in
book
form
and
it
now
appears
the
result
of
twenty
years
investigation
in
a
volume
of
over
five
hundred
and
fifty
pages
read
it
examine
for
yourselves
accept
or
reject
from
the
proof
offered
but
do
not
allow
the
church
or
the
state
to
govern
your
thought
or
dictate
your
judgment
woman
is
told
that
her
present
position
in
society
is
entirely
due
to
christianity
that
it
is
superior
to
that
of
her
sex
at
any
prior
age
of
the
world
church
and
state
both
maintaining
that
she
has
ever
been
inferior
and
dependent
man
superior
and
ruler
these
assertions
are
made
the
basis
of
opposition
to
her
demands
for
exact
equality
with
man
in
all
the
relations
of
life
although
they
are
not
true
either
of
the
family
the
church
or
the
state
such
assertions
are
due
to
with
the
existing
phase
of
historical
knowledge
whose
records
the
majority
of
mankind
have
neither
time
nor
opportunity
of
investigating
christianity
tended
somewhat
from
its
foundation
to
restrict
the
liberty
woman
enjoyed
under
the
old
civilizations
knowing
that
the
position
of
every
human
being
keeps
pace
with
the
religion
and
civilization
of
his
country
and
that
in
many
ancient
nations
woman
possessed
a
much
greater
degree
of
respect
and
power
than
she
has
at
the
present
age
this
subject
will
be
presented
from
a
historical
standpoint
if
in
so
doing
it
helps
to
show
man
s
unwarranted
usurpation
over
woman
s
religious
and
civil
rights
and
the
very
great
difference
between
true
religion
and
theology
this
book
will
not
have
been
written
in
vain
as
it
will
prove
that
the
most
grievous
wrong
ever
inflicted
upon
woman
has
been
in
the
christian
teaching
that
she
was
not
created
equal
with
man
and
the
consequent
denial
of
her
rightful
place
in
church
and
state
the
last
half
century
has
shown
great
advance
in
historical
knowledge

inaccessible

as

their

and

orders
all
these
have
been
investigated
and
a
new
historic
basis
has
been
discovered
never
has
research
been
so
thorough
or
knowledge
so
fully
given
to
the
world
these
records
prove
that
woman
had
acquired
great
liberty
under
the
old
civilizations
a
form
of
society
existed
at
an
early
age
known
as
the
matriarchate
or
under
the
matriarchate
except
as
son
and
inferior
man
was
not
recognized
in
either
of
these
great
institutions
family
state
or
church
a
father
and
husband
as
such
had
no
place
either
in
the
social
political
or
religious
scheme
woman
was
ruler
in
each
the
primal
priest
on
earth
she
was
also
supreme
as
goddess
in
heaven
the
earliest
semblance
of
the
family
is
traceable
to
the
relationship
of
mother
and
child
alone
here
the
primal
idea
of
the
family
had
birth
the
child
bore
its
mother
s
name
tracing
its
descent
from
her
her
authority
over
it
was
regarded
as
in
accord
with
nature
the
father
having
no
part
in
the
family
remained
a
wanderer
long
years
elapsed
before
man
as
husband
and
father
was
held
in
esteem
the
son
as
child
of
his
mother
ranked
the
father
the
mother
taking
precedence
over
both
the
father
and
the
son
blood
relationship
through
a
common
mother
preceded
that
of
descent
through
the
father
in
the
development
of
society
this
priority
of
the
mother
touched
not
alone
the
family
but
controlled
the
state
and
indicated
the
form
of
religion
thus
we
see
that
during
the
matriarchate
woman
ruled
she
was
first
in
the
family
the
state
religion
the
most
ancient
records
showing
that
man
s
subjection
to
woman
preceded
by
long
ages
that
of
woman
to
man
the
tribe
was
united
through
the
mother
social
political
and
religious
life
were
all
in
harmony
with
the
idea
of
woman
as
the
first
and
highest
power
the
earliest
phase
of
life
being
dependent
upon
her
she
was
recognized
as
the
primal
factor
in
every
relation
man
holding
no
place
but
that
of
dependent
every
part
of
the
world
today
gives
evidence
of
the
system
reminiscences
of
the
matriarchate
everywhere
abound
livingstone
found
african
tribes
swearing
by
the
mother
and
tracing
descent
through
her
marco
polo
discovered
similar
customs
in
his
asiatic
voyages
and
the
same
customs
are
extant
among
the
indians
of
our
own
continent
bachofen
and
numerous
investigators
agree
in
the
statement
that
in
the
earliest
forms
of
society
the
family
government
and
religion
were
all
under
woman
s
control
that
in
fact
society
started
under
woman
s
absolute
authority
and
power
the
second
step
in
family
life
took
place
when
the
father
dropping
his
own
name
took
that
of
his
child
this
old
and
custom
is
still
extant
in
many
portions
of
the
globe
the
primitive
peoples
of
java
australia
and
madagascar
are
among
those
still
continuing
its
practice
by
this
step
the
father
allied
himself
to
both
mother
and
child
although
still
holding
an
inferior
position
to
both
the
matriarchal
family
was
now
fully
established
descent
still
running
in
the
female
line
thus
as
has
been
expressed
we
find
that
woman
s
liberty
did
not
begin
today
nor
under
modern
religions
or
forms
or
government
but
that
she
was
in
reality
the
founder
of
civilization
and
that
in
the
most
remote
times
woman
enjoyed
superiority
of
rights
in
all
the
institutions
of
life
and
yet
so
difficult
is
it
to
break
away
from
educated
thought
so
slight
a
hold
have
historical
facts
upon
the
mind
when
contrary
to
preconceived
ideas
that
we
find
people
still
expressing
the
opinion
that
man
s
place
has
always
been
first
in
government
even
under
those
forms
of
society
where
woman
was
undisputed
head
of
the
family
its
very
existence
due
to
her
descent
entirely
in
the
female
line
we
still
hear
assertion
that
his
must
have
been
the
controlling
political
power
but
at
that
early
period
to
which
we
trace
the
formation
of
the
family
it
was
also
the
political
unit
and
when
peoples
became
aggregated
into
communities
when
tribal
relations
were
ultimately
recognized
woman
still
held
superior
position
and
was
the
controlling
power
in
government
and
never
was
justice
more
perfect
never
civilization
higher
than
under
the
matriarchate
historians
agree
as
to
the
high
civilization
even
today
of
those
nations
or
tribes
still
preserving
traces
of
matriarchal
customs
even
under
its
most
degenerate
form
the
family
governmental
and
religious
rights
of
women
are
more
fully
recognized
than
under
any
phase
of
christian
civilization
in
all
the
oldest
religions
equally
with
the
semitic
cults
the
feminine
was
recognized
as
a
component
and
superior
part
of
divinity
goddesses
holding
the
supreme
place
even
at
much
later
periods
woman
shared
equally
with
man
in
the
highest
priestly
offices
and
was
deified
after
death
in

the
victorious
was
worshiped
as
mother
of
the
gods
and
in
the
yearly
festival
held
in
her
honor
every
family
took
part
for
the
time
holding
a
priestly
office
to
neglect
this
duty
was
deemed
an
omission
of
great
irreverence
the
most
ancient
occultism
recognized
the
creative
power
as
feminine
and
preceding
both
gods
and
men
under
the
matriarchate
monogamy
was
the
rule
neither
polyandry
or
promiscuity
existed
for
long
years
after
the
decline
of
the
matriarchate
we
still
discover
that
among
many
of
the
most
refined
nations
woman
still
possessed
much
of
the
power
that
belonged
exclusively
to
her
during
that
early
period
ancient
egypt
recognized
as
the
wisest
nation
since
the
direct
historic
period
traced
descent
even
to
the
throne
in
the
female
line
to
this
reminiscence
of
the
matriarchate
are
we
indebted
for
the
story
of
moses
and
his
preservation
by
an
egyptian
princess
in
direct
contravention
of
the
pharaoh
s
orders
as
told
by
the
bible
and
josephus
she
not
alone
preserved
the
child
s
life
but
carried
him
to
the
king
as
her
son
given
to
her
by
the
bounty
of
the
river
and
heir
to
his
throne
as
showing
woman
s
power
in
that
kingdom
the
story
is
worthy
of
being
farther
traced
josephus
says
that
to
please
his
daughter
the
king
took
the
child
in
his
arms
placing
his
crown
on
the
baby
head
but
the
chief
priest
at
that
moment
entering
the
room
in
a
spirit
of
prophecy
cried
aloud
oh
king
this
is
the
child
of
whom
i
foretold
danger
kill
him
and
save
the
nation
at
the
same
time
striving
to
take
the
babe
from
the
king
but
the
princess
caught
him
away
thus
setting
both
kingly
and
priestly
power
at
defiance
taking
this
step
by
virtue
of
her
greater
authority
protecting
him
until
he
reached
manhood
and
causing
him
to
be
educated
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
in
a
college
under
her
own
control
nor
in
the
supreme
hour
of
the
nation
s
peril
when
the
king
too
old
to
lead
his
armies
to
battle
demanded
moses
as
heir
to
the
throne
in
his
place
would
she
give
him
up
until
she
had
exacted
an
oath
from
her
father
the
potent
pharaoh
that
he
meant
the
youth
no
harm
the
famous
iroquois
indians

six

at

of

from
the

from

it
has

and

showed
alike
in
form
of
government
and
in
social
life
reminiscences
of
the
matriarchate
the
line
of
descent
feminine
was
especially
notable
in
all
tribal
relations
such
as
the
election
of
chiefs
and
the
council
of
matrons
to
which
all
disputed
questions
were
referred
for
final
adjudication
no
sale
of
lands
was
valid
without
consent
of
the
squaws
and
among
the

archives
at
albany
new

treaties
are
preserved
signed
by
the
sachems
and
principal

of

the

possessed

an

forbidding

demonstrated
woman
s
superiority
in

when
an
indian
husband
brought
the
products
of
the
chase
to
the
wigwam
his
control
over
it
ceased
in
the
home
the
wife
was
absolute
the
sale
of
the
skins
was
regulated
by
her
the
price
was
paid
to
her
if
for
any
cause
the
iroquois
husband
and
wife
separated
the
wife
took
with
her
all
the
property
she
had
brought
into
the
wigwam
the
children
also
accompanied
the
mother
whose
right
to
them
was
recognized
as
supreme
so
fully
to
this
day
is
descent
reckoned
through
the
mother
that
children
of
white

are
numbered
in

not
alone
the
iroquois
but
most
indians
of
north
america
trace
descent
in
the
female
line
among
some
tribes
woman
enjoys
almost
the
whole
legislative
authority
and
in
others
a
prominent
share
lafitte
and
other
jesuit
missionary
writers
are
corroborated
in
this
statement
by
schoolcraft
catlin
clark
hubert
bancroft
of
the
pacific
coast
and
many
students
of
indian
life
and
customs
but
the
most
notable
fact
connected
with
woman
s
participation
in
governmental
affairs
among
the
iroquois
is
the
statement
of
hon
george
bancroft
that
the
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
was
borrowed
from
that
of
the
six
nations
thus
to
the
matriarchate
or
is
the
modern
world
indebted
for
its
first
conception
of
inherent
rights
natural
equality
of
condition
and
the
establishment
of
a
civilized
government
upon
this
basis
although
the
reputation
of
the
iroquois
as
warriors
appears
most
prominent
in
history
we
nevertheless
find
their
real
principles
to
have
been
the
true
matriarchal
one
of
peace
and
industry
driven
from
the
northern
portion
of
america
by
vindictive
foes
compelled
to
take
up
arms
in
yet
the
more
peaceful
occupations
of
hunting
and
agriculture
were
continually
followed
their
history
was
preserved
by
means
of
wampum
while
under
their
women
the
science
of
government
reached
the
highest
form
known
to
the
world
among
the
zunis
of
new
mexico
woman
still
preserves
supreme
religious
and
political
authority
the
paramount
council
consisting
of
six
priests
under
control
of
a
supreme
priestess
who
is
the
most
important
functionary
of
the
tribe
this
form
of
government
is
traceable
to
their
earliest
civilization
at
which
period
their
cities
were
grouped
in
sevens
six
of
them
constructed
upon
a
uniform
plan
the
supreme
seventh
containing
six
temples
clustered
about
a
supreme
central
seventh
temple
while
male
priests
ruled
over
the
six
primal
cities
the
central
and
superior
seventh
was
presided
over
by
a
priestess
who
not
alone
officiated
at
the
central
temple
but
to
whom
the
male
priests
of
the
six
cities
and
six
inferior
temples
were
subservient
the
ancient
lycians
the
sclavs
the
basques
of
spain
the
veddas
of
ceylon
the
inhabitants
of
malabar
the
aborigines
of
widely
separated
lands
all
show
convincing
proof
of
woman
s
early
superiority
in
religion
in
the
state
and
in
the
family
monogamy
was
a
marked
feature
of
the
matriarchate
bachofen
who
has
written
voluminously
upon
the
matriarchate
recognizes
it
as
peculiarly
characteristic
of
woman
s
government
he
also
says
the
people
who
possessed
the
together
with
gynaikokraty
girls
rule
excelled
in
their
love
of
peace
and
justice
under
the
matriarchal
family
and
tribal
system
even
long
after
its
partial
supersedence
by
the
incoming
patriarchate
the
marriage
relation
was
less
oppressive
to
woman
than
it
has
been
under
most
centuries
of
christian
civilization
daughters
were
free
in
their
choice
of
husbands
no
form
of
a
force
or
sale
existing
one
of
the
most
brilliant
modern
examples
of
the
matriarchate
was
found
in
malabar
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
by
the
portuguese
in
the
xv
century
the
nairs
were
found
to
possess
a
fine
civilization
entirely
under
the
control
of
women
at
a
period
when
woman
s
position
in
england
and
on
the
continent
of
europe
was
that
of
a
household
and
political
slave
of
malabar
it
has
been
said
that
when
the
portuguese
became
acquainted
with
the
country
and
the
people
they
were
not
so
much
surprised
by
the
opulence
of
their
cities
the
splendor
of
all
their
habits
of
living
the
great
perfection
of
their
navy
the
high
state
of
the
arts
as
they
were
to
find
all
this
under
the
entire
control
and
government
of
women
the
difference
in
civilization
between
christian
europe
and
pagan
malabar
at
the
time
of
its
discovery
was
indeed
great
while
europe
with
its
new
art
of
printing
was
struggling
against
the
church
for
permission
to
use
type
its
institutions
of
learning
few
its
opportunities
for
education
meagre
its
terrible
inquisition
crushing
free
thought
and
sending
thousands
each
year
to
a
most
painful
death
the
uncleanliness
of
its
cities
and
the
country
such
as
to
bring
frequent
visits
of
the
plague
its
armies
and
its
navies
with
but
one
exception
imperfect
its
women
forbidden
the
right
of
inheritance
religious
political
or
household
authority
feminine
principle
entirely
eliminated
from
the
purely
masculine
god
the
universal
object
of
worship
all
was
directly
the
opposite
in
malabar
cleanliness
peace
the
arts
a
just
form
of
government
the
recognition
of
the
feminine
both
in
humanity
and
in
the
divinity
were
found
in
malabar
to
the
question
of
a
danish
missionary
concerning
their
opinion
of
a
supreme
being
this
beautiful
answer
was
given
the
supreme
being
has
a
form
and
yet
has
no
form
he
can
be
likened
to
nothing
we
can
not
define
him
and
say
that
he
is
this
or
that
he
is
neither
man
or
woman
neither
heaven
or
earth
and
yet
he
is
all
subject
to
no
corruption
no
mortality
and
with
neither
sleep
nor
rest
he
is
almighty
and
omnipotent
without
beginning
and
without
end
under
the
missionaries
sent
by
england
to
introduce
her
own
barbaric
ideas
of
god
and
man
this
beautiful
matriarchal
civilization
of
malabar
soon
retrograded
and
was
lost
the
ancient
mound
builders
of
america
of
whom
history
is
silent
and
science
profoundly
ignorant
are
proven
by
means
of
symbolism
to
have
been
under
matriarchal
rule
and
motherhood
religion
anciently
motherhood
was
represented
by
a
sphere
or
circle
the
circle
like
the
mundane
egg
which
is
but
an
elongated
circle
contains
everything
in
itself
and
is
the
true
microcosm
it
is
eternity
it
is
feminine
the
creative
force
representing
spirit
through
its
union
with
matter
in
the
form
of
the
nine
digits
it
is
likewise
capable
of
representing
all
natural
things
the
perfect
circle
of
giotto
was
an
emblem
of
divine
motherhood
in
its
completeness
it
is
a
remarkable
significance
not
recognized
the
roughly
sketched
diameter
within
the
circle
found
wherever
boys
congregate
is
an
ancient
mystic
sign
signifying
the
male
and
female
or
the
deity
it
is
the
union
of
all
numbers
the
one
within
the
zero
mark
comprising
ten
and
as
part
of
the
ancient
mysteries
signifying
god
the
creative
power
and
eternal
life
it
was
an
emblem
of
the
all
in
many
old
religions
the
generative
principle
was
regarded
as
the
mother
of
both
gods
and
men
in
the
christian
religion
we
find
tendency
to
a
similar
recognition
in
catholic
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
the
most
ancient
aryans
were
under
the
matriarchate
the
feminine
recognized
as
the
creative
power
the
word
from
which
all
descendants
of
those
peoples
derive
their
names
for
mother
was
synonymous
with
renouf
the
great
antiquarian
authority
upon
the
aryan
s
gives
the
songs
and
ceremonies
of
the
wedding
in
these
the
woman
is
represented
as
having
descended
to
man
from
association
with
divine
beings
in
whose
custody
and
care
she
has
been
and
who
give
her
up
with
reluctance
in
sanscrit
mythology
the
feminine
is
represented
by
swrya
the
sun
the
source
of
life
while
the
masculine
is
described
as
soma
a
body
soma
a
beverage
of
the
gods
especially
sacred
to
indra
was
the
price
paid
by
him
for
the
assistance
of
vayu
the
swiftest
of
the
gods
in
his
battle
against
the
demon
vritra
a
curious
line
of
thought
is
suggested
the
marriage
of
the
man
to
the
woman
was
symbolized
as
his
union
with
the
gods
soma
a
drink
devoted
to
indra
the
highest
god
signified
his
use
of
a
body
or
the
union
of
spirit
and
body
in
the
same
manner
woman
representing
spirit
by
her
marriage
to
man
became
united
with
a
body
as
during
the
present
dark
age
the
body
has
been
regarded
more
highly
than
the
spirit
we
find
a
of
the
woman
although
the
union
of
spirit
and
body
is
symbolized
in
the
christian
church
by
the
sacrament
of
bread
and
wine
during
the
purest
period
of
aryan
history
marriage
was
entirely
optional
with
woman
and
when
entered
into
frequently
meant
no
more
than
spiritual
companionship
woman
equally
with
man
was
entitled
to
the
brahminical
thread
she
also
possessed
the
right
to
study
and
preach
the
vedas
which
was
in
itself
a
proof
of
her
high
position
in
this
race
the
vedas
believed
to
be
the
oldest
literature
extant
were
for
many
ages
taught
orally
requiring
years
of
close
application
upon
part
of
both
teacher
and
student
the
word
signifies
the
latter
from
meaning
the
english
term
widow
is
traceable
to
both
forms
of
the
word
meaning
a
wise
who
knows
man
many
ages
passed
before
the
vedas
were
committed
to
writing
at
that
early
day
the
ancestral
worship
of
as
frequent
as
that
of
departed
fathers
women
conducting
such
services
which
took
place
three
times
a
day
in
the
old
aryan
scriptures
the
right
of
woman
to
hold
property
and
to
her
children
was
much
more
fully
recognized
than
under
the
christian
codes
of
today
many
of
the
olden
rights
of
women
are
still
extant
in
india
the
learned
keshub
chunder
sen
vigorously
protested
against
the
introduction
of
english
law
into
india
upon
the
ground
that
it
would
destroy
the
ancient
rights
of
the
women
of
that
country
it
was
primal
indian
law
that
upon
the
death
of
the
husband
the
wife
should
heir
all
his
property
marriage
was
regarded
as
an
eternal
union
the
two
by
this
act
having
so
fully
become
one
that
upon
the
husband
s
death
one
half
of
his
body
was
still
living
the
property
and
the
children
were
held
as
equally
belonging
to
the
husband
or
the
wife

another
remarkable
feature
of

contrasting
with
that
of

was
preference
of

in

the

if
the

of
a

give
anything
to

this

even
without

at

making
the

if

merely
have
it
in
their

that
the

thus
given
should

all
and

of
these
articles
are
called

her
right

disposal
by

is
also
specified
her

go
to
her

in

to

possessing

to

when

dies
then
whatever

the
specification
of

of
intention
is
remarkable
in
securing
property
to
the
wife
that
was
seemingly
given
by
the
parents
to
the

alone
an
equally
remarkable
fact
is
the
father

to
the
husband
s
and
the
heirship
of
the
daughters
and
mother
in
preference
to
any
male
relative
however
near
and
is
in
striking
contrast
to
christian
law
in
reference
to
woman
s
property
if
a
husband
neglect
to
provide
his
wife
necessary
food
and
clothing
the
east
indian
wife
is
allowed
to
procure
them
by
any
means
in
her
power
maine
has
not
failed
to
recognize
the
superior
authority
of
the
eastern
wife
in
relation
to
property
over
that
of
the
christian
wife
he
says
the
settled
property
of
a
married
woman
incapable
of
alienation
by
her
husband
is
well
known
to
the
hindoos
under
the
name
of
it
is
certainly
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
institution
seems
to
have
developed
among
the
hindoos
at
a
period
relatively
much
earlier
than
among
the
romans
the
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
revered
authorities
of
the
hindoo
judicial
treatises
defines
stridham
or
woman
s
property
as
that
which
is
given
to
the
wife
by
the
father
the
mother
or
a
brother
at
the
time
of
the
wedding
before
the
nuptial
fire
but
adds
maine
the
compiler
of
mitakshara
adds
a
proportion
not
found
elsewhere
also
property
which
she
may
have
acquired
by
inheritance
purchase
partition
seizure
or
finding
is
denominated
woman
s
property
if
all
this
be
stridham
it
follows
that
the
ancient
hindoo
law
secured
to
married
women
an
even
greater
degree
of
proprietary
independence
than
that
given
to
them
by
the
modern
english

the

of

rewarded
with
bliss
in
heaven
but
hell
is
the
portion
of
that
man
whose

is
afflicted
with
pain
by
his

therefore
the
hindoo

is
taught
to

beings
who
from
the
services
they
had
rendered
to
humanity
were
upon
death
admitted
to
the
assembly
of
the
gods
such
deification
common
in
ancient
times
is
still
customary
in
some
parts
of
the
earth
within
the
past
few
years
a
countryman
of
our
own
was
thus
apotheosized
by
the
chinese
to
whom
he
had
rendered
valuable
service
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
ancient
egyptians
recognized
a
masculine
and
feminine
principle
entering
in
all
things
both
material
and
spiritual
isis
the
best
beloved
and
most
worshiped
of
the
secondary
gods
was
believed
by
them
to
have
been
a
woman
who
at
an
early
period
of
egyptian
history
had
rendered
that
people
invaluable
service
she
was
acknowledged
as
their
earliest
through
whose
teaching
the
people
had
risen
from
barbarism
to
civilization
she
taught
them
the
art
of
making
bread
from
the
cereals
theretofore
growing
wild
and
unused

inhabitants
at
an
early
day
living
upon
roots

egypt
soon
became
the

portion
of
the

enormous
crops
of
wheat
not
alone
aiding
herself
but
rendering
the
long
stability
of
the
roman
empire
possible
the
science
of
medicine
was
believed
to
have
originated
with
isis
she
was
also
said
to
have
invented
the
art
of
embalming
established
their
literature
founded
their
religion
the
whole
egyptian
civilization
was
ascribed
to
the
isis
whose
name
primarily
signified
light
life
isis
and
lady
of
the
worshiped
as
the
beginning
and
the
end
they
were
the
alpha
and
omega
of
the
most
ancient
egyptian
religion
the
statues
of
isis
bore
this
inscription
i
am
all
that
has
been
all
that
shall
be
and
none
among
mortals
has

isis
was

to
contain
germs
within
herself
for
the
reproduction
of
all
living
things
the
most
universal
of
her
names
was
potent
mother
this
egyptian
regard
for
isis
is
an
extremely
curious
and
interesting
reminiscence
of
the
matriarchal
period
her
worship
was
universal
throughout
egypt
her
temples
were
magnificent
her
priests
consecrated
to
purity
were
required
to
bathe
daily
to
wear
linen
garments
unmixed
with
animal
fibre
to
abstain
from
animal
food
and
also
from
those
vegetables
regarded
as
impure
two
magnificent
festivals
were
yearly
celebrated
in
her
honor
the
whole
people
taking
part
during
one
of
these
festivals
her
priests
bore
a
golden
ship
in
the
procession
the
ship
or
ark
is
peculiarly
significative
of
the
feminine
principle
and
wherever
found
is
a
reminiscence
of
the
matriarchate
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
the
egyptian
religion
whose
secrets
even
pythagoras
could
not
penetrate
to
which
herodotus
alluded
with
awe
and
that
were
unknown
to
any
person
except
the
highest
order
of
priests
owed
their
institution
to
isis
and
were
based
upon
moral
responsibility
and
a
belief
in
a
future
life
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
the
underlying
principle
of
the
egyptian
religion
isis
seems
to
have
been
one
of
those
extraordinary
individuals
such
as
occasionally
in
the
history
of
the
world
have
created
a
literature
founded

was

person
of
superior
mentality

diffuse

moses

in
all
the
wisdom
of

much
from

the
forms
and
ceremonies

in

largely
copied
by
him

the

whether

tended
somewhat
from

this

those

give
most
credit
to
the
humanizing
effect
of
christianity
upon
woman
are
compelled
to
admit
her
superiority
among
pagan
nations
before
the
advent
of
this
religion
the
patriarchate
under
which
biblical
history
and
judaism
commenced
was
a
rule
of
men
whose
lives
and
religion
were
based
upon
passions
of
the
grossest
kind
showing
but
few
indications
of
softness
or
refinement
monogamous
family
life
did
not
exist
but
a
polygamy
whose
primal
object
was
the
formation
of
a
clan
possessing
hereditary
chiefs
ruling
aristocratically
to
this
end
the
dominion
of
man
over
woman
and
the
birth
of
many
children
was
requisite
to
this
end
polygamy
was
instituted
becoming
as
marked
a
feature
of
the
patriarchate
as
monogamy
was
of
the
matriarchate
not
until
the
patriarchate
were
wives
regarded
as
property
the
sale
of
daughters
as
a
legitimate
means
of
family
income
or
their
destruction
at
birth
looked
upon
as
a
justifiable
act
under
the
patriarchate
society
became
morally
revolutionized
the
family
the
state
the
form
of

entirely
changed
the
theory
of
a
male
supreme
god
in
the
interests
of
force
and
authority
wars
family
discord
the
sacrifice
of
children
to
appease
the
wrath
of
an
offended
male
deity
are
all
due
to
the
patriarchate
these
were
practices
entirely
out
of
consonance
with
woman
s
thought
and
life
biblical
abraham
binding
isaac
for
sacrifice
to
jehovah

kept
his
intentions

up
his

in

with
his

allowing
her
a

life
for
the
bewailment
of
her
virginity
are
but
typical
of
the
low
regard
of
woman
under
the
patriarchate
during
this
period
the
destruction
of
girl
children
became
a
widely
extended
practice
and
infantile
girl
murder
the
custom
of
many
nations
during
the
matriarchate
all
life
was
regarded
as
holy
even
the
sacrifice
of
animals
was
unknown
the
most
ancient
and
purest
religions
taught
sacrifice
of
the
animal
passions
as
the
great
necessity
in
but
the
patriarchate
subverted
this
sublime
teaching
materializing
spiritual
truths
and
substituting
the
sacrifice
of
animals
whose
blood
was
declared
a
sweet
smelling
savor
to
the
lord
of
hosts
both
infanticide
and
prostitution
with
all
their
attendant
horrors
are
traceable
with
polygamy
the
patriarchate
or
under
which
judaism
and
christianity
rose
as
forms
of
religious
belief
under
the
patriarchate
woman
has
ever
been
regarded
as
a
slave
to
be
disposed
of
as
father
husband
or
brother
chose
even
in
the
most
christian
lands
daughters
have
been
esteemed
valuable
only
in
proportion
to
the
political
or
pecuniary
advantage
they
brought
to
the
father
in
the
legal
prostitution
of
an
enforced
marriage
the
sacrifice
of
woman
to
man
s
baser
passions
has
ever
been
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
patriarchate
but
woman
s
degradation
is
not
the
normal
condition
of
humanity
neither
did
it
arise
from
a
settled
principle
of
evolution
but
is
a
retrogression
due
to
the
grossly
material
state
of
the
world
for
centuries
past
in
which
it
has
lost
the
interior
meaning
or
spiritual
significance
of
its
own
most
holy
words
jehovah
signifies
not
alone
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
principles
but
also
the
spirit
or
vivifying
intelligence
it
is
a
compound
word
indicative
of
the
three
divine
principles
holy

in

from
whence
we
obtain
the

gender
although
invariably
translated

the
word
jehovah
too
sacred
to
be
spoken
by
the
jews
signified
the

the
proof
of
the
double
meaning
of
jehovah
the
masculine
and
feminine
signification
is
undeniable
lanci
one
of
the
great
orientalists
says
jehovah
should
be
read
from
left
to

and
pronounced
that
is
to
say
hi
pronounced
he
ho
in
hebrew
being
the
masculine
pronoun
and
hi
the
feminine
therefore
denotes
the
male
and

principles
the
vis
genatrix
kingsford
says
the
arbitrary
and
harsh
aspect
under
which
jehovah
is
chiefly
presented
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
is
due
not
to
any
lack
of
the
feminine
element
either
in
his
name
or
in
his
nature
or
to
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
inspired
leaders
of
israel
to
recognize
their
equality
but
to
the
rudimentary
condition
of
the
people
at
large
and
their
consequent
amenability
to
the
delineation
of
the
stern
side
only
of
the
divine
character
the
hebrew
word
translated
the
almighty
is
still
more
distinctively
feminine
than
as
it
means
the
breasted
god
and
is
made
use
of
in
the
old
testament
whenever
the
especially
feminine
characteristics
of
god
are
meant
to
be
indicated
the
story
of
the
building
of
the
tower
of
babel
and
the
subsequent
confusion
of
language
possesses
deep
interior
significance
the
word
babel
meaning
god
the
father
as
distinct
and
separate
from
the
feminine
principle
the
confusion
which
has
come
upon
humanity
because
of
this
separation
has
been
far
more
lamentable
in
its
results
than
a
mere
confounding
of
tongues
in
the
earliest
religions
the
recognition
of
the

principle
in

and
female
to
obtain
firm
hold
in
their
minds
prejudice
which
simply
means
prejudgment
a
judgment
without
proof
has
long
ruled
mankind
owing
chiefly
to
that
bondage
of
the
will
inflicted
by
a
tyrannous
priesthood
but
we
have
now
reached
a
period
in
history
when
investigation
is
again
taking
the
place
of
blind
belief
and
the
truth
capable
of
making
man
free
is
once
more
offered
it
is
through
a
recognition
of
the
divine
element
of
motherhood
as
not
alone
inhering
in
the
great
primal
source
of
life
but
as
extending
throughout
all
creation
that
it
will
become
possible
for
the
world
so
buried
in
darkness
folly
and
superstition
to
practice
justice
toward
woman
not
legislation
but
education
will
bring
about
the
change
not
external
acts
but
internal
thought
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
acknowledgment
of
a
feminine
element
even
in
plants
was
regarded
by
the
church
as
heretical
yet
though
still
perceiving
but
partial
truth
science
now
declares
the
feminine
principle
to
inhere
in
plants
rocks
gems
and
even
in
the
minutest
atoms
thus
in
some
degree
recognizing
the
occult
axiom
as
it
is
above
so
it
is
while
the
inferior
and
secondary
position
of
woman
early
became
an
integral
portion
of
christianity
its
fullest
efforts
are
seen
in
church
teachings
regarding
marriage
inasmuch
as
it
was
a
cardinal
doctrine
that
the
fall
of
adam
took
place
through
his
temptation
into
marriage
by
eve
this
relation
was
regarded
with
holy
horror
as
a
continuance
of
the
evil
which
first
brought
sin
into
the
world
depriving
man
of
his
immortality
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
the
expected
millennium
of
a
thousand
years
upon
earth
with
its
material
joys
has
ever
had
more
attraction
for
christians
than
the
eternal
spiritual
rapture
of
heaven
many
of
the
old
fathers
taught
that
the
world
is
a
state
of
matrimony
but
paradise
of
to
such
extent
was
this
doctrine
carried
it
was
declared
that
had
it
not
have
been
for
the
fall
god
would
have
found
some
way
outside
of
this
relation
for
populating
the
world
consequently
marriage
was
regarded
as
a
condition
of
peculiar
temptation
and
trial
celibacy
as
one
of
especial
holiness
the
androgynous
theory
of
primal
man
found
many
supporters
the
separation
into
two
beings
having
been
brought
about
by
sensual
desire
jacob
boehme
and
earlier
mystics
of
that
class
recognized
the
double
sexuality
of
god
in
whose
image
man
was
made
one
of
the
most
revered
ancient
scriptures
the
gospel
according
to
the
hebrews
which
was
in
use
as
late
as
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
taught
the
equality
of
the
feminine
in
the
godhead
also
that
daughters
should
inherit
with
sons
fragments
of
this
gospel
have
recently
been
discovered
the
fact
remains
undeniable
that
at
the
advent
of
christ
a
recognition
of
the
feminine
element
in
the
divinity
had
not
entirely
died
out
from
general
belief
the
earliest
and
lost
books
of
the
new
testament
teaching
this
doctrine
the
whole
confirmed
by
the
account
of
the
birth
and
baptism
of
jesus
the
holy
spirit
the
feminine
creative
force
playing
the
most
important
part
it
was
however
but
a
short
period
before
the
church
through
canons
and
decrees
as
well
as
apostolic
and
private
teaching
denied
the
femininity
of
the
divine
equally
with
the
divinity
of
the
feminine
there
is
however
abundant
proof
that
even
under
but
partial
recognition
of
the
feminine
principle
as
entering
in
the
divinity
woman
was
officially
recognized
in
the
early
services
of
the
church
being
ordained
to
the
ministry
officiating
as
deacons
administering
the
act
of
baptism
dispensing
the
sacrament
interpreting
doctrines
and
founding
sects
which
received
their
names
the
more
mystical
among
priests
taught
that
before
woman
was
separated
from
man
the
elementals
were
accepted
by
man
as
his
children
and
endowed
by
him
with
immortality
but
at
the
separation
of
the
androgynous
body
into
the
two
beings
adam
and
eve
the
woman
through
accident
was
also
endowed
with
immortality
which
theretofore
had
solely
inhered
in
the
masculine
portion
of
the
being
these
mystics
also
taught
that
this
endowment
of
woman
with
immortality
together
with
her
capability
of
bringing
new
beings
into
existence
also
endowed
with
immortal
life
was
the
cause
of
intense
enmity
toward
her
on
the
part
of
the
elementals
especially
shown
by
their
bringing
suffering
and
danger
upon
her
at
this
period
still
another
class
recognizing
marriage
as
a
necessity
for
the
continuance
of
the
species
looked
upon
it
with
more
favor
attributing
the
fall
to
another
cause
yet
throwing
odium
upon
the
relation
by
maintaining
that
the
marriage
of
adam
and
eve
did
not
take
place
until
after
they
had
been
driven
from
paradise
this
doctrine
was
taught
by
the
father
hieronymus
thus
with
strange
inconsistency
the
church
supported
two
entirely
opposing
views
of
marriage
yet
even
those
who
upheld
its
necessity
still
taught
woman
s
complete
subordination
to
man
in
that
relation
also
that
this
condition
was
one
of
great
tribulation
to
man
it
was
even
declared
that
god
caused
sleep
to
fall
upon
adam
at
the
creation
of
eve
in
order
to
prevent
his
opposition
lecky
speaking
of
the
noxious
influences
of
ascetics
upon
marriage
says
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
anything
more
coarse
and
repulsive
than
the
manner
in
which
the
church
regarded
it
it
was
invariably
treated
as
a
consequence
of
the
fall
of
adam
and
regarded
from
its
lowest
aspect
but
having
determined
that
evil
was
necessary
in
order
to
future
good
the
church
decided
to
compel
a
belief
that
its
control
of
this
contract
lessened
the
evil
to
this
end
declaring
marriage
illegal
without
priestly
sanction
thus
creating
a
conviction
of
and
belief
in
its
sacramental
nature
in
the
minds
of
the
people
despite
the
favoring
views
of
a
class
regarding
marriage
celibacy
was
taught
as
the
highest
condition
for
both
man
and
woman
and
as
early
as
the
third
century
many
of
the
latter
entered
upon
a
celibate
life
jerome
using
his
influence
in
its
favor
augustine
while
admitting
the
possibility
of
salvation
to
the
married
yet
speaking
of
a
mother
and
daughter
in
heaven
compared
the
former
to
a
star
of
the
second
magnitude
but
the
latter
as
shining
with
great
brilliancy
the
superior
respect
paid
to
the
celibates
even
among
women
is
attributed
to
direct
instruction
of
the
apostles
the
apostolic
constitutions
held
even
by
the
episcopal
church
as
regulations
established
by
the
apostles
themselves
and
believed
to
be
among
the
earliest
christian
records
give
elaborate
directions
for
the
places
of
all
who
attend
church
the
unmarried
being
the
most
honored
the
virgins
and
widows
and
elder
women
stood
or
sat
first
of
all
the
chief
respect
shown
by
the
early
fathers
towards
marriage
was
that
it
gave
virgins
to
the
church
while
the
possibility
of
salvation
to
the
married
at
first
recognized
was
denied
at
later
date
even
to
persons
otherwise
living
holy
lives
the
emperor
jovinian
banished
a
man
who
asserted
the
possibility
of
salvation
to
married
persons
provided
they
obeyed
all
the
ordinances
of
the
church
and
lived
good
lives
as
part
of
this
doctrine
the
church
taught
that
woman
was
under
an
especial
curse
and
man
a
divinely
appointed
agent
for
the
enforcement
of
that
curse
it
inculcated
the
belief
that
all
restrictions
placed
upon
her
were
but
parts
of
her
just
punishment
for
having
caused
the
fall
of
man
under
such
teaching
a
belief
in
the
supreme
virtue
of
declared
by
the
apostle
paul
firmly
established
to
augustine
is
the
world
indebted
for
full
development
of
the
theory
of
original
sin
promulgated
by
paul
as
a
doctrine
of
the
christian
church
in
the
declaration
that
adam
first
created
was
not
first
in
sin
paul
brought
up
in
the
strictest
external
principles
of
judaism
did
not
lose
his
educational
bias
or
primal
belief
when
changing
from
judaism
to
christianity
neither
was
his
character
as
persecutor
changed
when
he
united
his
fortunes
with
the
new
religion
he
gave
to
the
christian
world
a
lever
long
enough
to
reach
down
through
eighteen
centuries
all
that
time
moving
it
in
opposition
to
a
belief
in
woman
s
created
and
religious
equality
with
man
to
her
right
of
private
judgment
and
to
her
personal
freedom
his
teaching
that
adam
first
created
was
not
first
in
sin
divided
the
unity
of
the
human
race
in
the
assumption
that
woman
was
not
part
of
the
original
creative
idea
but
a
secondary
thought
an
inferior
being
brought
into
existence
as
an
appendage
to
man
although
based
upon
a
false
conception
of
the
creative
power
this
theory
found
ready
acceptance
in
the
minds
of
the
men
of
the
new
church
not
illiterate
having
received
instruction
at
the
feet
of
gamaliel
paul
was
yet
intolerant
and
credulous
nay
more
unscrupulous
he
was
the
first
jesuit
in
the
christian
church
becoming
all
things
to
all
the
reformed
church
with
strange
unanimity
has
chosen
paul
as
its
leader
and
the
accepted
exponent
of
its
views
he
may
justly
be
termed
the
protestant
pope
and
although
even
among
catholics
rivalling
peter
in
possession
of
the
heavenly
keys
yet
the
church
of
rome
has
accepted
his
authority
as
in
many
respects
to
be
more
fully
obeyed
than
even
the
teachings
of
st
peter
having
been
accepted
by
the
church
as
the
apostolic
exponent
of
its
views
upon
marriage
it
was
but
to
be
expected
that
his
teachings
should
be
received
as
divine
that
paul
was
unmarried
has
been
assumed
because
of
his
bitterness
against
this
relation
yet
abundant
proof
of
his
having
a
wife
exists
for
the
membership
of
the
great
sanhedrim
marriage
was
a
requisite
clement
of
alexandria
positively
declared
that
paul
had
a
wife
until
the
time
of
cromwell
when
it
was
burned
a
letter
of
ignatius
in
greek
was
preserved
in
the
old
oxford
library
this
letter
spoke
of
st
peter
and
paul
and
the
apostles
who
were
another
letter
of
ignatius
is
still
extant
in
the
vatican
library
tussian
and
others
who
have
seen
it
declare
that
it
also
speaks
of
paul
as
a
married
man
but
tenderness
toward
woman
does
not
appear
in
his
teachings
man
is
represented
as
the
master
the
head
of
woman
in
consonance
with
his
teaching
responsibility
has
been
denied
her
through
the
ages
although
the
church
has
practically
held
her
amenable
for
the
ruin
of
the
world
prescribing
penance
and
hurling
anathemas
against
her
whom
it
has
characterized
as
the
door
of
at
a
synod
in
winchester
in
the
eighth
century
dunstan
famed
for
his
hatred
of
women
made
strenuous
effort
to
enforce
celibate
life
it
was
asserted
to
be
so
highly
immoral
for
a
priest
to
marry
that
even
a
wooden
cross
had
audibly
declared
against
the
horrid
practice
although
in
the
third
century
marriage
was
permitted
to
all
orders
of
the
clergy
yet
the
very
ancient
gospel
of
the
egyptians
endorsed
as
canonical
by
clement
of
alexandria
taught
celibacy
these
old
christian
theologians
found
the
nature
of
woman
a
prolific
subject
of
discussion
a
large
party
classing
her
among
brutes
without
soul
or
reason
as
early
as
the
sixth
century
a
council
at
macon
bishops
taking
part
devoted
its
time
to
a
discussion
of
this
question
does
woman
possess
a
soul
upon
one
side
it
was
argued
that
woman
should
not
be
called
homo
upon
the
opposite
side
that
she
should
because
first
the
scriptures
declared
that
god
created
man
male
and
female
second
that
jesus
christ
son
of
a
woman
is
called
the
son
of
man
christian
women
were
therefore
allowed
to
remain
human
beings
in
the
eyes
of
the
clergy
even
though
considered
very
weak
and
bad
ones
but
nearly
a
thousand
years
after
this
decision
in
favor
of
the
humanity
of
the
women
of
christian
europe
it
was
still
contended
that
the
women
of
newly
discovered
america
belonged
to
the
brute
creation
possessing
neither
souls
nor
reason
as
late
as
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
an
anonymous
work
appeared
arguing
that
women
were
no
part
of
mankind
but
a
species
of
intermediate
animal
between
the
human
and
the
brute
creation
mulieres
non
est
homines
etc
mediaeval
christian
writings
show
many
discussions
upon
this
point
the
influence
of
these
old
assertions
still
manifesting
themselves
until
the
time
of
peter
the
great
women
were
not
recognized
as
human
beings
in
that
great
division
of
christendom
known
as
the
greek
church
the
census
of
that
empire
counting
only
males
or
so
many
souls
woman
named
traces
of
this
old
belief
have
not
been
found
wanting
in
our
own
country
within
the
century
as
late
as
the
woman
s
rights
convention
in
philadelphia
an
objector
in
the
audience
cried
out
let
women
first
prove
they
have
souls
both
the
church
and
the
state
deny
everything
connected
with
woman
was
held
to
be
unclean
it
is
stated
that
agathro
desired
the
sophist
herodes
to
get
ready
for
him
the
next
morning
a
vessel
full
of
pure
milk
that
is
to
say
which
had
not
been
milked
by
the
hand
of
a
woman
but
he
perceived
as
soon
as
it
was
offered
to
him
that
it
was
not
such
as
he
desired
protesting
that
the
scent
of
her
hands
who
had
milked
it
offended
his
nostrils
in
the
oldest
european
churches
great
distinction
was
made
between
the
purity
of
man
and
woman
at
an
early
date
woman
was
forbidden
to
receive
the
eucharist
into
her
naked
hand
on
account
of
her
impurity
or
to
sing
in
church
on
account
of
her
inherent
wickedness
to
such
an
extent
was
this
opposition
carried
that
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
did
not
hesitate
to
provide
itself
with
eunuchs
in
order
to
supply
cathedral
choirs
with
the
soprano
tones
inhering
by
nature
in
woman
alone
one
of
the
principal
charges
against
the
huguenots
was
that
they
permitted
women
to
sing
in
church
using
their
voices
in
praise
of
god
contrary
to
the
express
command
of
paul
catherine
de
medicis
reproaching
them
for
this
great
sin
the
massacre
at
bartholomew
when
men
women
and
children
lost
their
lives
and
the
entire
destruction
of
many
families
of
purest
character
took
place
with
an
additional
great
loss
to
france
from
the
banishment
of
hundreds
more
may
be
traced
to
the
teaching
of
paul
that
woman
should
keep
silence
in
the
church
this
doctrine
also
crossed
the
ocean
with
the
puritan
fathers
and
has
appeared
in
america
under
many
forms
the
christianity
of
the
ages
teaching
the
existence
of
a
superior
and
inferior
sex
possessing
different
rights
under
the
law
and
in
the
church
it
has
been
easy
to
bring
man
and
woman
under
accountability
to
a
different
code
of
morals
for
this
double
code
the
church
is
largely
indebted
to
the
subtle
and
acute
paul
who
saw
in
the
new
religion
but
an
enlarged
judaism
that
should
give
prominence
to
abraham
and
his
seed
from
whom
christ
claimed
descent
his
conversion
did
not
remove
his
old
jewish
contempt
for
woman
as
shown
in
his
temple
service
the
law
forbidding
her
entrance
beyond
the
outer
court
nor
could
he
divest
himself
of
the
spirit
of
the
old
morning
prayer
which
daily
led
each
jew
to
thank
god
that
he
was
not
born
a
heathen
a
slave
or
a
woman
he
brought
into
the
new
dispensation
the
influence
of
the
old
ceremonial
law
which
regarded
woman
as
unclean
the
jewish
exclusion
of
forty
days
from
even
the
outer
court
of
the
sanctuary
to
the
woman
who
had
given
birth
to
a
son
and
of
twice
that
period
or
eighty
days
if
a
daughter
had
been
born
was
terminated
in
both
religions
by
a
in
expiation
of
the
mother
s
crime
for
having
at
the
peril
of
her
own
brought
another
human
being
into
life
this
old
testament
teaching
degraded
the
principle
exemplified
in
motherhood
and
in
a
way
lessened
the
nation
s
regard
for
womanhood
first
through
the
and
purification
demanded
of
the
mother
second
by
its
doubling
the
period
of
exclusion
from
the
temple
in
case
a
girl
was
given
to
the
world
the
birth
of
girls
even
under
christianity
has
everywhere
been
looked
upon
as
an
infliction
and
thousands
have
been
immured
in

there
to
die
of
despair
or
to
linger
through
years
the
victim
alike
of
father
and
of
priest
the
influence
of
judaism
extended
through
christendom
the
custom
of
purification
after
maternity
inherited
by
the
church
from
judaism
brought
with
it
into
christianity
the
same
double
restriction
and
chastening
of
the
mother
in
case
her
infant
proved
a
girl
a
gift
as
propitiation
or
expiation
being
required
uncleanliness
was
attributed
to
woman
in
every
function
of
her
being
the
purification
of
the
virgin
mary
who
was
not
exempt
when
after
the
birth
of
a
god
being
used
as
an
incontrovertible
argument
in
proof
a
festival
of
the
purification
of
the
virgin
mary
adopted
from
paganism
was
introduced
into
rome
at
an
early
date
thus
perpetuating
a
belief
in
the
uncleanliness
of
motherhood
the
church
in
the
roman
empire
soon
united
with
the
state
in
imposing
new
restrictions
upon
women
since
the
reformation
the
mother
s
duty
of
expiation
has
been
confirmed
by
the
anglican
church
and
is
known
in
england
as
directions
as
to
the
woman
s
dress
at
this
time
was
early
made
the
subject
of
a
canon
she
was
to
be
decently
appareled
this
term
decently
variously
interpreted
was
at
times
the
occasion
of
serious
trouble
in
during
the
reign
of
james
i
the
chancellor
of
norwich
ordered
that
every
woman
who
came
to
be
churched
should
be
covered
with
a
white
veil
a
woman
who
refused
to
conform
to
this
order
was
excommunicated
for
contempt
she
prayed
a
prohibition
alleging
that
such
order
was
not
warranted
by
any
custom
or
canon
of
the
church
of
england
the
judges
of
the
civil
court
finding
themselves
incompetent
to
decide
upon
such
a
momentous
question
requested
the
opinion
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
not
willing
to
trust
his
own
judgment
that
dignitary
convened
several
bishops
for
consultation
their
decision
was
against
the
woman
this
protestant
council
upon
woman
s
dress
declaring
that
it
was
the
ancient
usage
of
the
church
of
england
for
women
who
were
to
be
churched
to
come
veiled
and
a
prohibition
was
denied
the
doctrine
that
woman
must
remain
covered
when
in
the
sacred
church
building
shows
itself
in
the
united
states
in
many
instances
under
christianity
woman
has
been
entirely
excluded
from
religious
houses
and
church
buildings
when
pope
boniface
founded
the
abbey
of
fulda
he
prohibited
the
entrance
of
women
into
any
of
the
buildings
even
including
the
church
this
rule
remained
unbroken
during
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
and
even
when
in
the
emperor
lothair
went
to
fulda
to
celebrate
pentecost
his
empress
was
not
permitted
to
witness
the
ceremonies
when
frederick
barbarossa
proposed
to
spend
his
easter
there
he
was
not
even
allowed
to
enter
the
house
because
of
having
his
wife
with
him
in
boniface
ix
at
the
request
of
the
abbot
john
merlow
relaxed
the
rule
and
permitted
women
to
attend
the
services
of
the
church
shortly
afterwards
the
building
was
destroyed
by
lightning
which
was
looked
upon
as
evidence
of
the
divine
displeasure
at
the
desecration
the
monastery
of
athos
under
the
greek
church
situated
upon
an
island
does
not
permit
the
entrance
of
a
female
animal
upon
its
confines
even
in
america
woman
has
met
similar
experience
at
certain
periods
during
the
middle
ages
conversation
with
women
was
forbidden
during
the
black
death
the
flaggellants
or
brotherhood
of
the
cross
were
under
such
interdict
in
this
last
decade
of
the
xix
century
the
catholic
church
still
imposes
similar
restrictions
upon
certain
religious
houses
early
in
the
of
spain
visited
the
monastery
of
mirzaflores
its
rules
not
allowing
a
monk
to
speak
to
a
woman
the
queen
was
received
in
silence
her
majesty
immediately
telegraphed
to
the
pope
asking
indulgence
which
was
granted
and
during
four
hours
the
monks
were
permitted
the
sin
of
speaking
to
a
woman
it
is
curious
to
note
that
the
first
sentence
uttered
by
one
of
the
monks
was
a
compliment
upon
the
simplicity
of
her
majesty
s
attire
but
the
most
impressive
evidence
of
the
contempt
of
the
church
towards
all
things
feminine
was
shown
in
a
remark
by
tetzel
the
great
dealer
in
indulgences
offering
one
for
sale
he
declared
it
would
insure
eternal
salvation
even
if
the
purchaser
had
committed
rape
upon
the
mother
of
god
a
knowledge
of
facts
like
these
is
necessary
in
order
to
a
just
understanding
of
our
present
civilization
especially
as
to
the
origin
of
restrictive
legislation
concerning
woman
the
civilization
of
today
is
built
upon
the
religious
theories
of
the
middle
ages
supplemented
by
advancing
freedom
of
thought
lea
declares
thus
the
latin
church
is
the
great
fact
which
dominates
the
history
of
modern
civilization
all
other
agencies
which
molded
the
destinies
of
europe
were
comparatively
isolated
or
sporadic
in
their
manifestations
the
influence
of
church
teaching
is
most
strikingly
manifested
in
the
thought
of
today
without
predetermined
intention
of
wrong
doing
man
has
been
so
molded
by
the
church
doctrine
of
ages
and
the
coordinate
laws
of
state
as
to
have
become
blind
to
the
justice
of
woman
s
demand
for
freedom
such
as
he
possesses
nor
is
woman
herself
scarcely
less
bound
although
now
torn
by
the
spirit
of
rebellion
which
burned
in
the
hearts
of
her
so
cruelly
persecuted
so
falsely
judged
during
past
ages
when
the
most
devout
christian
woman
possessed
no
rights
in
the
church
the
government
or
the
family
the
learning
which
had
been
hers
in
former
periods
was
then
interdicted
as
an
especial
element
of
evil
her
property
rights
recognized
in
former
periods
then
denied
as
a
being
subordinate
to
man
she
was
not
allowed
a
separate
estate
or
control
over
the
earnings
of
her
own
hands
her
children
were
not
her
own
but
those
of
a
master
for
whose
interest
or
pleasure
she
had
given
them
birth
without
freedom
of
thought
or
action
trained
to
consider
herself
secondary
to
a
man
a
being
who
came
into
the
world
not
as
part
of
the
great
original
plan
of
creation
but
as
an
afterthought
of
her
creator
and
this
doctrine
taught
as
one
of
the
most
sacred
mysteries
of
religion
which
to
doubt
was
to
insure
her
eternal
damnation
it
is
not
strange
that
the
great
body
of
women
are
not
now
more
outspoken
in
demanding
equal
religious
and
governmental
rights
with
man
but
another
phase
of
heredity
shows
itself
in
the
eagerness
with
which
women
enter
all
phases
of
public
life
which
does
not
place
them
in
open
antagonism
with
church
or
state
education
industries
club
life
and
even
those
great
modern
and
religious
organizations
which
bring
them
before
the
public
throwing
active
work
and
responsibility
upon
them
would
be
entirely
unexplainable
were
it
not
for
the
tendency
of
inherited
thought
to
ultimately
manifest
itself
the
long
continued
and
powerfully
repressing
influence
of
church
teaching
in
regard
to
the
created
inferiority
of
women
imposed
upon
millions
of
men
and
women
a
bondage
of
thought
and
action
which
even
the
growing
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
not
yet
been
able
to
cast
off
to
this
doctrine
we
can
trace
all
the
irregularities
which
for
many
centuries
filled
the
church
with
shame
practices
more
obscene
than
those
of
babylon
or
corinth
dragged
christendom
to
a
darkness
blacker
than
the
night
of
heathendom
in
the
most
pagan
darkness
so
intense
that
the
most
searching
efforts
of
the
historian
but
now
and
then
cast
a
ray
of
light
upon
it
darkness
so
profound
that
in
europe
from
the
seventh
to
the
eleventh
centuries
no
individual
thought
can
be
traced
no
opinion
was
formed
no
heresy
arose
all
christendom
was
sunk
in
superstition
lange
says
the
disappearance
of
ancient
civilization
in
the
early
centuries
of
the
christian
era
is
an
event
the
serious
problems
of
which
are
in
great
part
still
had
lange
not
been
influenced
by
the
subtle
current
of
heredity
which
unwittingly
influenced
nations
and
systems
equally
with
individuals
he
could
easily
have
discovered
the
cause
of
this
disappearance
of
olden
civilization
to
be
in
the
degradation
of
the
feminine
element
under
christianity
while
this
darkness
of
christian
europe
was
so
great
that
history
knows
less
of
it
a
thousand
years
since
than
it
does
of
egypt
years
ago
one
corner
of
that
continent
was
kept
luminous
by
the
brilliance
of
mohammedan
learning
the
arabs
alone
had
books
from
the
eighth
to
the
thirteenth
centuries
of
the
christian
era
the
moors
of
spain
kept
that
portion
of
europe
bright
while
all
else
was
sunk
in
darkness
universities
existed
learning
was
fostered
and
women
authors
were
numerous
for
many
hundred
years
rome
possessed
no
books
but
missals
and
a
few
bibles
in
the
hands
of
priests
men
were
bound
by
church
dogmas
looking
only
for
aggrandisement
through
her
the
arts
ceased
to
flourish
science
decayed
learning
was
looked
upon
as
a
disgrace
to
a
warrior
the
only
occupation
deemed
worthy
of
the
noble
the
priesthood
who
alone
possessed
a
knowledge
of
letters
prostituted
their
learning
to
the
basest
uses
the
nobility
when
not
engaged
against
a
common
foe
spent
their
time
battling
against
each
other
the
peasantry
were
by
turns
the
sport
and
victim
of
priest
and
noble
while
woman
was
the
prey
of
all
her
person
and
her
rights
possessed
no
consideration
except
as
she
could
be
made
to
advance
the
interest
or
serve
the
pleasure
of
priest
noble
father
husband
some
to
whose
lightest
desire
all
her
wishes
were
made
to
bend
the
most
pronounced
doctrine
of
the
church
at
this
period
was
that
through
woman
sin
had
entered
the
world
that
woman
s
whole
tendency
was
towards
evil
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
unfortunate
oversight
of
her
creation
man
would
then
be
dwelling
in
the
paradisal
innocence
and
happiness
of
eden
with
death
entirely
unknown
when
the
feminine
was
thus
wholly
proscribed
the
night
of
moral
and
spiritual
degradation
reached
its
greatest
depth
and
that
condition
ensued
which
has
alike
been
the
wonder
and
the
despair
of
the
modern
historians
whose
greatest
fault
as
buckle
shows
has
been
the
reading
of
history
from
a
few
isolated
facts
rather
than
building
up
its
philosophy
from
an
aggregation
of
events
upon
many
different
planes
under
all
restrictions
woman
did
not
fail
to
show
her
innate
power
even
within
the
fold
of
the
church
she
founded
devout
orders
established
and
endowed
religious
institutions
and
issued
her
commands
to
the
pope
himself
in
more
than
one
instance
seating
that
holy
personage
in
the
papal
chair
from
paulina
whose
life
was
written
by
jerome
to
the
promulgation
of
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
virgin
mary
by
the
ecumenical
council
under
pius
ix
and
the
later
canonization
of
joan
of
arc
woman
has
not
failed
to
impress
even
the
christian
world
with
a
sense
of
her
intellectual
and
spiritual
power
yet
despite
the
very
great
influence
exerted
by
so
many
women
in
the
affairs
of
the
the
canonization
of
so
many
women
she
has
only
been
able
to
show
her
capacity
at
an
immense
expenditure
of
vital
force
against
constant
priestly
opposition
and
the
powerful
decrees
of
councils
subtle
and
complex
as
are
the
influences
that
mould
thought
and
character
we
can
not
comprehend
the
great
injustice
of
the
church
towards
woman
in
its
teaching
of
her
mental
and
spiritual
inferiority
without
a
slight
examination
of
the
great
religious
institutions
that
have
been
under
her
charge
of
these
none
possess
more
remarkable
history
than
the
abbey
of
fontervault
founded
in
for
both
monks
and
nuns
it
belonged
in
the
general
rank
of
benedictines
and
was
known
as
the
order
of
fontervault
it
was
ruled
by
an
abbess
under
title
of
general
of
the
order
who
was
responsible
to
no
authority
but
that
of
the
pope
himself
forming
a
long
succession
of
able
women
in
abbesses
from
the
most
eminent
families
of
france
woman
s
capacity
for
the
management
of
both
ecclesiastical
and
civil
affairs
was
there
shown
for
six
hundred
years
it
was
the
abbess
who
alone
decided
the
religious
fitness
of
either
monk
or
nun
seeking
admission
to
the
order
it
was
the
abbess
who
decreed
all
ecclesiastical
and
civil
penalties
who
selected
the
confessors
for
the
different
houses
of
the
order
throughout
france
and
spain
who
managed
and
controlled
the
vast
wealth
belonging
to
this
institution
it
was
the
abbess
who
drew
up
the
rules
for
the
government
of
the
order
and
who
also
successfully
defended
these
privileges
when
attacked
for
neither
the
protection
of
the
pope
the
wealth
of
the
order
or
the
family
influence
connected
with
it
prevented
priestly
attack
and
no
argument
in
favor
of
woman
s
governing
ability
is
stronger
than
the
fact
that
its
abbesses
ever
successfully
resisted
these
priestly
assaults
upon
the
privileges
of
their
order
the
abbey
of
fontervault
with
its
grounds
of
forty
or
fifty
acres
was
surrounded
by
high
walls
its
soil
was
tilled
by
the
monks
of
the
abbey
who
received
even
their
food
as
alms
from
the
nuns
returning
all
fragments
for
distribution
to
the
poor
the
authority
of
women
was
supreme
in
all
monasteries
of
the
order
the
ecclesiastical
power
maintained
by
these
abbesses
is
the
more
remarkable
as
it
was
in
direct
contravention
of
the
dictates
of
the
early
councils
that
of
forbidding
abbesses
to
give
the
veil
or
take
upon
themselves
any
priestly
function
the
later
council
of
paris
bitterly
complained
that
women
served
at
the
altar
and
even
gave
to
people
the
body
and
blood
of
jesus
christ
among
the
convents
controlled
by
women
which
have
largely
influenced
religious
thought
was
that
of
the
paraclete
in
the
century
under
heloise
its
teachings
that
belief
was
dependent
upon
knowledge
attacked
the
primal
church
tenet
that
belief
depends
upon
faith
alone
the
convent
of
port
royal
des
champs
during
the
century
exerted
much
influence
its
abbess
the
celebrated
mother
angelique
arnault
was
inducted
into
this
office
in
her
eleventh
year
upon
death
of
her
whose
she
had
been
this
convent
both
in
person
of
the
nuns
as
well
as
the
monks
connected
with
it
became
a
protest
against
the
jesuitical
doctrine
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
like
the
paraclete
is
intimately
connected
with
reform
questions
in
the
catholic
church
notwithstanding
such
evidences
of
woman
s
organizing
mind
and
governing
qualities
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
as
well
as
of
piety
so
unquestioned
as
to
have
produced
a
long
calendar
of
female
saints
the
real
policy
of
the
church
remained
unchanged
nor
could
it
be
otherwise
from
its
basis
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
and
original
sin
the
denial
to
women
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
and
the
control
of
her
own
actions
the
constant
teaching
of
her
greater
sinfulness
and
natural
impurity
had
a
very
depressing
effect
upon
the
majority
of
women
whose
lowly
station
in
life
was
such
as
to
deprive
them
of
that
independence
of
thought
and
action
possible
to
women
of
rank
and
wealth
then
as
now
the
church
catered
to
the
possessors
of
money
and
power
then
as
now
seeking
to
unite
their
great
forces
with
its
own
purpose
of
aggrandizement
and
thus
the
church
has
ever
obstructed
the
progress
of
humanity
delaying
civilization
and
condemning
the
world
to
a
moral
barbarism
from
which
there
is
no
escape
except
through
repudiation
of
its
teaching
to
the
theory
of
god
the
father
shorn
of
the
divine
attribute
of
motherhood
is
the
world
beholden
for
its
most
degrading
beliefs
its
most
infamous
practices
dependent
upon
the
identified
with
lost
motherhood
is
the
lost
name
of
ancient
writers
and
occultists
when
the
femininity
of
the
divine
is
once
again
acknowledged
the
lost
name
will
be
discovered
and
the
holiness
wholeness
of
divinity
be
manifested
as
the
theory
of
woman
s
wickedness
gathered
force
her
representative
place
in
the
church
lessened
from
century
to
century
restrictive
canons
multiplied
and
the
clergy
constantly
grew
more
corrupt
although
bearing
bad
reputation
at
an
early
date
tertullian
whose
heavy
diatribes
are
to
be
found
in

hundreds
of

total
exclusion
of
woman
from
the
christian
priesthood
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
during
this
period
was
the
constant
effort
of
the
church
even
during
the
ages
that
priestly
marriage
was
permitted
celibates
obtained
a
higher
reputation
for
sanctity
and
virtue
than
married
priests
who
infinitely
more
than
celibates
were
believed
subject
to
infestation
by
demons
the
restriction
upon
clerical
marriages
proceeded
gradually
first
the
superior
holiness
of
the
unmarried
was
taught
together
with
their
greater
freedom
from
infestation
by
demons
a
single
marriage
only
was
next
allowed
and
that
with
a
woman
who
had
never
before
entered
the
relation
the
council
of
consisting
of
bishops
forbade
the
ordination
of
those
priests
who
had
been
twice
married
or
whose
wife
had
been
a
widow
a
council
of
ruled
that
a
bishop
who
had
children
after
ordination
should
be
excluded
from
the
major
orders
the
council
of
deposed
chelidonius
bishop
of
besancon
for
having
married
a
widow
the
council
of
orleans
consisting
of
bishops
decided
that
monks
who
married
should
be
expelled
from
the
ecclesiastical
order
the
church
was
termed
the
spouse
of
the
priest
it
was
declared
that
peter
possessed
a
wife
before
his
conversion
but
that
he
forsook
her
and
all
worldly
things
after
he
became
christ
s
who
established
chastity
priests
were
termed
holy
in
proportion
as
they
opposed
marriage
the
unmarried
among
the
laity
who
had
never
entered
that
relation
and
the
married
who
forsook
it
were
regarded
as
saintly
so
great
was
the
opposition
to
marriage
that
a
layman
who
married
a
second
time
was
refused
benediction
and
penance
imposed
a
wife
was
termed
an
unhallowed
so
far
from
celibacy
producing
chastity
or
purity
of
life
church
restrictions
upon
marriage
led
to
the
most
debasing
crimes
the
most
revolting
vices
the
grossest
immorality
as
early
as
the
fourth
century
the
state
attempted
purification
through
a
statute
enacted
by
the
emperors
valentinian
valerius
and
gratian
prohibiting
ecclesiastics
and
monks
from
entering
the
houses
of
widows
single
women
living
alone
or
girls
who
had
lost
their
parents
the
nearest
ties
of
relationship
proved
ineffectual
in
protecting
woman
from
priestly
assault
and
incest
became
so
common
it
was
found
necessary
to
prohibit
the
residence
of
a
priest
s
mother
or
sister
in
his
house
this
restriction
was
renewed
at
various
times
through
the
ages
the
condemnation
of
the
council
of
rome
easter
under
the
pontificate
of
pope
leo
ix
was
not
directed
against
married
priests
but
against
those
who
held
incestuous
relations
yet
although
the
church
thus
externally
set
her
seal
of
disapprobation
upon
this
vice
her
general
teaching
sustained
it
gregory
bishop
of
venelli
convicted
of
this
crime
by
the
council
of
rome
was
punished
by
excommunication
but
in
a
short
time
was
restored
to
his
former
important
position
the
highest
legates
were
equally
guilty
with
the
inferior
priests
cardinal
john
of
cremona
the
pope
s
legate
to
the
council
of
westminister
sent
by
pope
honorius
for
the
express
purpose
of
enforcing
celibacy
became
publicly
notorious
and
disgraced
and
was
obliged
to
hastily
leave
england
in
consequence
of
his
teaching
and
his
practice
being
diametrically
opposed
through
this
clerical
contempt
of
marriage
the
conditions
of
celibacy
and
virginity
were
regarded
as
of
the
highest
virtue
jerome
respected
marriage
as
chiefly
valuable
in
that
it
gave
virgins
to
the
church
while
augustine
in
acknowledging
that
marriage
perpetuated
the
species
also
contended
that
it
also
perpetuated
original
sin
these
diverse
views
in
regard
to
marriage
created
the
most
opposite
teaching
from
the
church
by
one
class
the
demand
to
increase
and
multiply
was
constantly
brought
up
and
women
were
taught
that
the
rearing
of
children
was
their
highest
duty
the
strangest
sermons
were
sometimes
preached
toward
the
enforcement
of
this
command
others
taught
an
entirely
different
duty
for
both
men
and
women
and
a
large
celibate
class
was
created
under
especial
authority
of
the
church
women
especially
those
of
wealth
were
constantly
urged
to
take
upon
themselves
the
vow
of
virginity
their
property
passing
into
possession
of
the
church
thus
helping
to
build
up
priestly
power
another
class
held
the
touch
of
a
woman
to
be
a
contamination
and
to
avoid
it
holy
men
secluded
themselves
in
caves
and
forests
through
numerous
decretals
confirmation
was
given
to
the
theory
that
woman
was
defiled
through
the
physical
peculiarities
of
her
being
even
her
beauty
was
counted
as
an
especial
snare
and
temptation
of
the
devil
for
which
in
shame
she
ought
to
do
continual
penance
chrysostom
whose
prayer
is
repeated
at
every
sunday
morning
service
of
the
episcopal
church
described
women
as
a
necessary
evil
a
natural
temptation
a
desirable
calamity
a
domestic
peril
a
deadly
fascination
and
a
painted
but
to
escape
her
influence
was
impossible
and
celibacy
led
to
the
most
direful
results
monks
and
hermits
acknowledged
themselves
tormented
in
their
solitary
lives
by
visions
of
beautiful
women
monasteries
were
visited
by
an
illness
to
which
celibacy
imparted
a
name
and
impurity
of
body
and
soul
spread
throughout
christendom
the
general
tone
of
the
church
in
regard
to
marriage
its
creation
of
a
double
code
of
morality
its
teaching
of
woman
s
greater
sinfulness
together
with
that
of
her
absolute
subordination
to
man
subverted
the
moral
character
of
the
christian
world
within
whose
borders
the
vilest
systems
of
immorality
arose
which
the
world
has
ever
known
its
extent
being
a
subject
of
historical
record
according
to
the
teaching
of
men
who
for
many
hundreds
of
years
were
molders
of
human
thought
priests
philosophers
and
physicians
alike
nature
never
designed
to
procreate
woman
her
intention
being
always
to
produce
men
these
authorities
asserted
that
nature
never
formed
the
feminine
except
when
she
lost
her
true
function
and
so
produced
the
female
sex
by
chance
or
accident
aristotle
whose
philosophy
was
accepted
by
the
church
and
all
teaching
of
a
contrary
character
declared
heretical
maintained
that
nature
did
not
form
woman
except
when
by
reason
of
imperfection
of
matter
she
could
not
obtain
the
sex
which
is
perfect
cajetan
enunciated
the
same
doctrine
many
hundred
years
later
aristotle
also
denied
creative
power
to
the
mother
while
throughout
its
history
the
course
of
the
christian
church
against
marriage
is
constantly
seen
no
less
noticeable
are
the
grossly
immoral
practices
resulting
from
celibacy
scarcely
a
crime
or
a
vice
to
which
it
did
not
give
birth
celibacy
was
fostered
in
the
interests
of
power
and
in
order
to
its
more
strict
enforcement
barons
were
permitted
to
enslave
the
wives
and
children
of
married
priests
those
of
rome
were
bestowed
upon
the
cathedral
church
of
the
lateran
and
bishops
throughout
christendom
were
ordered
to
enforce
this
law
in
their
own
dioceses
and
to
seize
the
wives
of
priests
for
the
benefit
of
their
churches
at
no
point
of
history
do
we
more
clearly
note
the
influence
of
the
church
upon
the
state
than
in
the
union
of
the
temporal
power
with
the
ecclesiastical
for
purposes
of
constraining
priestly
celibacy
under
reign
of
philip
i
of
france
a
council
was
held
at
troyes
which
condemned
the
marriage
of
priests
in
the
following
year
king
henry
i
of
england
summoned
a
council
to
assemble
in
london
for
purpose
of
upholding
priestly
celibacy
urging
its
enforcement
upon
the
bishops
and
pledging
his
kingly
honor
in
aid
a
new
series
of
canons
was
promulgated
strengthened
by
severe
penalties
and
the
of
the
king
finding
it
impossible
either
through
spiritual
or
temporal
power
to
compel
absolute
celibacy
the
king
for
the
benefit
of
his
exchequer
established
a
license
for
concubinage
upon
the
payment
of
a
tax
known
as
cullagium
notwithstanding
all
the
powerful
enginery
of
the
church
priestly
celibacy
so
contrary
to
nature
was
not
rendered
absolutely
imperative
until
the
thirteenth
century
the
fourth
lateran
council
twelfth
ecumenical
under
pope
innocent
iii
is
especially
famous
because
of
its
final
settlement
of
the
policy
of
the
church
in
regard
to
priestly
marriage
this
was
a
large
council
prelates
taking
part
in
the
adjudication
of
this
question
while
with
augustine
acknowledging
that
marriage
was
requisite
for
the
preservation
of
the
race
it
strictly
confined
this
relation
to
the
laity
the
subject
of
celibacy
as
we
see
had
agitated
the
church
from
its
foundation
a
more
renowned
council
even
than
the
twelfth
ecumenical
namely
the
first
nicene
or
second
ecumenical
having
seriously
discussed
it
although
after
prolonged
debate
pronouncing
against
celibacy
and
in
favor
of
priestly
marriage
paphinutius
the
martyr
bishop
of
thebes
although
himself
a
celibate
advocated
marriage
which
he
declared
to
be
true
chastity
the
council
adopting
his
opinion
although
the
tendency
of
the
church
for
so
many
hundred
years
had
been
towards
celibacy
yet
when
adopted
as
a
dogma
a
belief
in
its
propriety
or
its
scriptural
authority
was
by
no
means
universal
even
among
the
most
eminent
members
but
in
no
instance
has
the
control
of
the
church
over
the
consciences
and
will
of
its
adherents
been
more
forcibly
illustrated
many
illustrious
and
learned
theologians
as
gratian
the
canonist
thomas
aquinas
and
giraldus
cambrensis
of
davids
while
thereafter
sustaining
celibacy
a
law
of
the
declared
it
had
neither
scriptural
nor
apostolic
warrant
thomas
affirming
it
to
be
merely
a
law
of
human
ecclesiastical
origin
absolute
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
proved
very
difficult
of
enforcement
at
the
great
council
of
london
years
afterwards
cardinal
otto
deplored
the
fact
that
married
men
still
received
holy
orders
and
held
office
in
the
church
and
in
only
years
after
the
great
council
confirming
celibacy
as
a
doctrine
of
the
church
another
great
council
was
convened
in
london
when
cardinal
legate
ottoborn
the
direct
representative
of
the
pope
demanded
the
establishment
of
concubinage
for
priests
the
institutions
of
otto
and
ottoborn
long
remained
the
law
of
the
english
church
yet
to
their
honor
be
it
remembered
that
despite
council
and
cardinal
pope
and
church
there
were
priests
who
still
persistently
refused
either
to
part
from
their
wives
or
to
relinquish
their
priestly
functions
and
who
when
excommunicated
for
contumacy
laughed
at
the
sentence
and
continued
their
priestly
offices
others
sufficiently
conformed
to
the
edicts
to
lock
up
their
churches
and
suspend
their
priestly
administrations
yet
refusing
to
part
with
their
wives
the
relatives
of
wives
also
exerted
their
influence
against
the
action
of
the
church
the
struggle
was
bitter
and
long
new
canons
were
promulgated
and
celibacy
enforced
under
severe
penalties
or
rather
marriage
was
prohibited
under
severe
penalties
the
holy
robbery
which
made
slaves
of
the
wives
and
children
of
priests
confiscating
their
property
to
the
church
had
more
effect
in
compelling
celibacy
than
all
anathemas
upon
the
iniquity
of
marriage
priests
who
retained
their
wives
preferring
the
chastity
of
this
relation
to
the
license
allowed
celibates
were
prohibited
from
their
offices
and
their
wives
denounced
as
harlots
if
this
did
not
suffice
such
priests
were
finally
excommunicated
but
a
way
of
return
was
left
open
in
case
this
measure
coerced
them
into
abandoning
wives
and
children
a
short
penance
soon
restored
the
priestly
rank
with
all
its
attendant
dignities
nor
was
the
reinstated
priest
compelled
to
live
purely
so
little
was
it
expected
that
the
tax
upon
concubinage
soon
became
a
component
part
of
the
celibate
system
so
gross
and
broadspread
became
the
immorality
of
all
classes
that
even
the
head
of
the
church
pandered
to
it
in
the
erection
by
pope
sixtus
v
of
a
magnificent
building
devoted
to
illicit
pleasure
the
example
of
christ
himself
was
pointed
to
in
favor
of
celibacy
even
upon
the
cross
saying
to
his
mother
woman
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
the
saints
of
the
old
testament
as
well
as
the
new

opposed

abel

joshua
elias

daniel
john
the
baptist
john
the
evangelist
paul
with
his
disciples
and
all
saintly
personages
were
declared
to
have
been
celibates
a
concubinage
tax
was
exacted
from
all
the
clergy
without
exception
and
rendered
compulsory
even
upon
those
priests
who
still
kept
their
wives
or
who
lived
chastely
outside
of
the
marital
relation
protests
were
of
no
avail
those
whom
disinclination
age
or
kept
chaste
were
told
the
privilege
of
unchastity
was
open
to
them
the
bishop
must
have
the
money
and
after
payment
they
were
at
liberty
to
keep
concubines
or
not
under
concubinage
the
priest
was
free
from
all
family
responsibility
his
mistress
possessed
neither
present
nor
future
claim
upon
him
children
who
according
to
church
teaching
followed
the
condition
of
the
mother
were
born
to
him
but
for
their
education
and
maintenance
neither
ecclesiastical
nor
civil
law
compelled
him
to
provide
for
many
centuries
this
immoral
tax
brought
enormous
sums
into
the
treasuries
of
both
church
and
state
although
the
laws
against
the
marriage
of
priests
were
enacted
on
pretense
of
the
greater
inherent
wickedness
of
woman
history
proves
their
chief
object
to
have
been
the
keeping
of
all
priestly
possessions
under
church
control
it
was
openly
asserted
that
the
temporal
possessions
of
the
church
were
imperilled
by
sacerdotal
marriage
and
it
has
been
declared
with
every
proof
of
truthfulness
that
edicts
against
the
marriage
of
priests
were
promulgated
to
prevent
the
alienation
of
property
from
the
church
the
saying
of
paul
was
quoted
he
that
is
married
careth
for
his
wife
but
he
that
is
unmarried
for
the
married
bishops
were
occasionally
confirmed
in
their
sees
upon
condition
that
their
wives
and
children
should
not
inherit
their
property
which
upon
their
death
should
fall
to
the
church
the
struggle
against
the
absolute
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
was
bitter
a
few
priests
still
kept
their
benefices
while
retaining
their
wives
and
acknowledging
their
children
as
legitimate
the
sons
of
such
contumacious
priests
were
declared
forever
incapable
of
taking
holy
orders
unless
by
a
special
dispensation
the
church
showed
almost
equal
determination
in
the
establishment
of
concubinage
as
in
the
enforcement
of
priestly
celibacy
each
of
these
systems
tending
to
its
enrichment
opposition
proved
of
no
permanent
avail
holding
control
over
the
conscience
of
men
asserting
the
power
to
unlock
the
doors
of
heaven
and
hell
a
strongly
organized
body
working
to
one
end
it
is
not
a
subject
of
astonishment
that
the
church
its
chief
object
the
crushing
of
body
and
soul
should
in
the
end
prove
conqueror
and
the
foulest
crimes
against
woman
receive
approval
of
the
entire
christian
world
many
notable
consequences
followed
the
final
establishment
of
celibacy

a

similar

was
inaugurated
by

confirmation
of

celibacy
the
wives
of
such
men
suddenly
rendered
homeless
and
with
their
children
classed
among
the
vilest
of
earth
powerless
and
despairing
hundreds
shortened
their
agonies
by
death
at
their
own
hands
for
all
these
crimes
the
church
alone
is
responsible
under
celibacy
auricular
confession
and
extended
belief
in
witchcraft
a
new
era
of
wrong
toward
woman
was
inaugurated
from
thenceforth
her
condition
was
more
degraded
than
even
during
the
early
centuries
of
christianity
accusations
of
heresy
which
included
witchcraft
as
well
as
other
sins
against
the
church
were
constantly
made
against
that
being
who
was
believed
to
have
brought
sin
into
the
world
whosoever
dared
question
the
infallibility
of
the
church
by
use
of
their
own
judgment
even
upon
the
most
trivial
subjects
immediately
fell
into
condemnation
canon
law
gaining
full
control
over
civil
law
the
absolute
sinfulness
of
divorce
which
maintained
by
the
church
has
yet
been
allowed
by
civil
law
was
fully
established
woman
was
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
man
the
canon
law
maintaining
that
the
confession
of
a
guilty
woman
could
not
be
received
in
evidence
against
her
accomplice
although
it
held
good
against
herself
and
the
punishment
due
to
both
was
made
to
fall
on
the
woman
alone
the
best
authorities
prove
that
while
the
clergy
were
acquainted
with
the
civil
codes
that
had
governed
the
roman
empire
they
made
but
little
use
of
them
upon
coming
to
the
throne
justinian
had
repealed
the
law
of
the
patriarchate
which
gave
the
father
sole
right
and
title
to
and
interest
in
the
children
of
legal
marriage
but
this
was
soon
again
subverted
by
ecclesiasticism
and
under
canon
law
a
mother
was
prohibited
all
authority
over
her
child
its
relationship
to
her
even
being
denied
while
under
common
law
children
followed
the
condition
of
their
fathers
who
if
free
transmitted
freedom
to
their
children
yet
in
the
interests
of
priestly
celibacy
under
church
legislation
an
entire
reversal
took
place
and
children
were
held
to
follow
the
condition
of
their
mothers
thus
bore
to
fathers
slave
mothers
bore
slave
children
to
their
masters
while
unmarried
mothers
bore
bastard
children
to
both
priestly
and
lay
fathers
thus
throwing
the
taint
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
innocent
child
and
the
sole
burden
of
its
maintenance
upon
the
mother
this
portion
of
canon
law
also
became
the
law
of
the
state
in
all
christian
countries
and
is
in
existence
at
the
present
time
both
civil
codes
and
statue
laws
enforcing
this
great
wrong
of
the
church
the
relations
of
men
and
women
to
each
other
the
sinfulness
of
marriage
and
the
license
of
illicit
relations
for
the
priesthood
employed
the
thought
of
the
church
the
duty
of
woman
to
obey
not
alone
her
male
relatives
but
all
men
by
virtue
of
their
sex
was
sedulously
inculcated
she
was
trained
to
hold
her
own
desires
and
even
thoughts
in
abeyance
to
those
of
man
as
to
one
who
was
rightfully
her
master
every
holy
principle
of
her
nature
was
subverted
by
this
degrading
assumption
when
auricular
confession
became
confirmed
as
a
dogma
of
the
church
it
threw
immense
power
over
the
family
into
the
hands
of
the
priesthood
a
power
capable
of
being
converted
to
many
ends
but
was
specially
notable
in
its
influence
upon
morals
although
auricular
confession
was
not
established
as
a
dogma
until
the
council
of
it
had
been
occasionally
practiced
at
early
date
carrying
with
it
the
same
immorality
in
lesser
form
as
that
which
afterwards
became
so
great
a
reproach
to
the
church
through
its
means
the
priesthood
gained
possession
of
all
family
social
and
political
secrets
thus
acquiring
information
whose
power
for
evil
was
unlimited
the
spirit
of
evil
never
found
a
more
subtle
method
of
undermining
and
destroying
human
will
its
most
debasing
influences
falling
upon
woman
who
through
fear
of
eternal
damnation
made
known
her
most
secret
thoughts
to
the
confessor
an
unmarried
and
frequently
a
youthful
man
it
soon
became
a
source
of
very
great
corruption
to
both
priest
and
woman
another
effect
of
this
council
was
the
formal
prohibition
of
the
scriptures
to
the
laity
and
thenceforth
the
bible
was
confined
to
the
priest
who
explained
its
teachings
in
the
interests
of
his
own
order
adding
to
or
taking
from
to
suit
his
own
interests
the
recent
new
version
showing
many
such
interpolations
nothing
was
held
sacred
by
these
men
who
sacrificed
everything
to
their
own
advancement
and
that
of
their
order
the
insolence
of
the
priesthood
was
that
of
all
periods
claiming
direct
inspiration
from
god
they
taught
their
own
infallibility
and
in
name
of
him
whom
they
professed
to
serve
the
grossest
crimes
were
perpetrated
and
this
profession
became
a
protecting
sanctuary
to
men
whose
villainous
lives
would
otherwise
have
brought
them
to
the
gallows
with
conviction
of
woman
s
supreme
wickedness
increased
through
the
formal
recognition
of
celibacy
as
a
dogma
of
the
church
with
the
establishment
of
auricular
confession
and
the
denial
of
the
bible
to
the
laity
the
persecution
of
woman
for
witchcraft
took
on
new
phase
the
belief
that
it
was
the
ordinary
method
through
which
the
devil
won
souls
together
with
the
persuasion
that
woman
through
her
greater
wickedness
fell
more
readily
than
men
into
such
practices
acquired
a
firmer
seat
in
theology
heresy
of
which
witchcraft
was
one
phase
became
a
greater
sin
the
inquisition
arose
and
the
general
characteristics
of
the
christian
world
rapidly
grew
more
inimical
to
humanity
and
especially
to
woman
s
freedom
happiness
and
security
the
influence
of
the
church
daily
grew
more
unfavorable
to
all
virtue
vice
was
sustained
immorality
dignified
the
concubines
of
priests
called
wives
in
bitter
mockery
of
that
relation
in
which
the
legal
wife
was
termed
concubine
were
known
as
the
hallowed
ones
the
honored
no
stigma
attached
to
such
a
life
these
women
formed
quite
a
class
in
mediaeval
society
themselves
and
their
children
the
wives
of
ordinary
laymen
the
touch
of
a
priest
had
sanctified
them
in
the
estimation
of
the
church
an
immoral
life
led
with
a
priest
was
more
honorable
than
marriage
with
a
layman
and
all
the
obligations
such
a
relation
implied
priests
assumed
immunity
from
wrong
doing
so
far
from
celibacy
causing
purity
of
life
through
it
the
priesthood
grew
to
look
upon
themselves
as
especially
set
apart
for
indulgence
in
vice
did
not
history
so
faithfully
portray
this
condition
it
would
seem
impossible
that
it
had
existed
among
people
asserting
the
highest
morality
and
is
proof
of
the
danger
of
irresponsible
power
to
possessor
and
victim
alike
and
the
ease
with
which
the
true
meaning
of
right
and
wrong
is
lost
under
such
circumstances
the
theory
of
the
church
that
as
the
fall
and
sin
really
existed
priestly
immorality
became
a
necessity
in
order
to
perpetuate
the
world
even
through
a
continuance
of
the
original
sin
was
a
species
of
fine
casuistry
for
which
the
church
in
all
ages
has
been
remarkable
the
general
tenor
of
the
church
against
marriage
together
with
its
teaching
of
woman
s
greater
sinfulness
were
the
chief
causes
which
undermined
the
morality
of
the
christian
world
for
fifteen
hundred
years
with
these
doctrines
were
also
taught
the
duty
of
woman
to
sacrifice
herself
in
every
way
for
man
a
theory
of
which
the
present
century
is
not
unfamiliar
the
loss
of
chastity
in
woman
was
held
as
light
sin
in
comparison
to
the
degradation
that
marriage
would
bring
to
a
priest
and
young
girls
ruined
by
some
candidate
or
priest
considered
themselves
doing
god
service
in
refusing
a
marriage
that
would
cause
the
expulsion
of
the
priestly
lover
from
the
ecclesiastical
order
with
woman
s
divine
but
rather
demoniac
heloise
chose
to
be
deemed
the
mistress
of
abelard
rather
than
by
acknowledging
their
marriage
destroy
his
prospects
of
advancement
in
the
church
the
state
sustained
the
church
in
its
opposition
to
marriage
and
we
find
the
anomaly
of
marriage
for
political
reasons
where
the
parties
forever
separated
at
the
altar
jerome
and
at
a
later
date
dunstan
sustained
the
policy
of
such
marriages
the
history
of
britain
gives
instances
of
early
queens
thus
separating
from
their
newly
made
husbands
at
the
close
of
the
ceremony
dedicating
their
lives
to
celibacy
and
their
fortunes
to
the
church
nor
did
this
institution
neglect
that
large
class
of
women
to
whom
marriage
was
made
impossible
because
of
the
numbers
of
men
to
whom
it
was
forbidden
after
the
lateran
council
had
permanently
settled
the
action
of
the
church
in
favor
of
priestly
celibacy
great
effort
was
made
to
draw
women
of
wealth
into
a
monastic
life
religion
was
the
chief
method
of
acquiring
power
and
as
an
abbess
of
a
religious
institution
it
opened
opportunity
for
power
to
women
scarcely
possible
outside
the
church
the
two
highest
womanly
virtues
inculcated
by
the
church
were
a
celibate
life
and
liberality
to
religious
houses
it
was
taught
if
anything
could
possibly
mitigate
women
s
sin
through
eve
s
transgression
it
was
the
observance
of
these
two
conditions
to
the
student
this
is
the
most
remarkable
period
in
the
history
of
the
church
not
merely
as
a
culmination
of
the
effort
of
centuries
in
finally
deciding
the
questions
of
celibacy
so
long
agitated
with
such
varying
results
but
in
the
immediate
change
and
permanent
settlement
it
brought
about
in
regard
to
other
church
dogmas
as
well
as
its
pronounced
influence
in
causing
the
lutheran
reformation
it
was
asserted
that
the
spiritual
office
of
the
priest
sanctified
sin
it
became
a
maxim
that
whatever
a
priest
might
do
was
holy
by
their
taking
part
in
lasciviousness
it
became
consecration
to
disobey
a
priest
was
to
endanger
salvation
it
was
libellous
and
treasonable
to
question
the
purity
of
a
priest
s
motives
hence
religion
became
a
screen
for
all
vice
and
a
source
of
moral
degradation
to
all
woman
to
such
extent
was
belief
carried
in
the
superior
purity
of
a
celibate
life
that
but
little
more
than
years
since
a
man
was
burned
at
the
stake
in
england
for
asserting
the
lawfulness
of
priestly
marriage
the
action
of
the
council
of
so
powerfully
sustaining
the
olden
claims
of
the
superior
holiness
of
celibacy
soon
created
a
belief
in
the
inability
of
a
priest
to
commit
sin
during
the
middle
ages
his
infallibility
was
constantly
maintained
his
superior
sanctity
in
consequence
of
his
celibacy
universally
asserted
it
was
impossible
not
to
connect
the
idea
of
great
wickedness
with
those
incapable
of
entering
this
holy
office
and
as
woman
by
virtue
of
sex
was
prohibited
priestly
functions
and
as
her
marriage
had
been
declared
a
necessity
for
the
world
these
conditions
were
used
as
arguments
against
her
the
conscience
and
morality
of
tens
of
thousands
were
destroyed
by
these
teachings
enforced
as
they
were
by
all
the
dread
authority
of
the
church
the
christian
world
was
under
entire
control
of
a
class
whose
aim
was
chiefly
that
of
personal
aggrandizement
and
that
hesitated
at
no
means
for
securing
wealth
and
power
the
inquisition
was
firmly
established
under
its
reign
six
hundred
methods
of
torture
were
known
and
it
was
conducted
with
such
secrecy
that
not
until
dragged
before
it
were
many
of
its
victims
aware
they
were
under
suspicion
even
when
imprisoned
in
its
torture
chambers
the
charges
against
them
were
kept
secret
in
hopes
thereby
to
compel
upon
other
points
the
inferiority
of
woman
her
proneness
to
evil
and
readiness
to
listen
to
all
suggestions
of
satan
was
taught
with
renewed
vigor
and
power
for
evil
the
priest
regarded
himself
as
the
direct
representative
of
divinity
the
theory
of
infallibility
was
not
confined
to
the
pope
but
all
dignitaries
of
the
church
made
the
same
claim
asserting
themselves
incapable
of
wrong
doing
maintaining
an
especial
sanctification
by
reason
of
their
celibacy
priests
nevertheless
made
their
holy
office
a
cover
for
the
most
degrading
sensuality
methods
were
taken
to
debauch
the
souls
as
well
as
the
bodies
of
women
having
first
taught
their
special
impurity
it
was
not
maintained
that
immorality
with
a
priest
was
not
sin
but
on
the
contrary
hallowed
the
woman
giving
her
particular
claim
upon
heaven
it
was
taught
that
sin
could
only
be
killed
through
sin
the
very
incarnation
was
used
as
a
means
of
weakening
woman
s
virtue
that
christ
did
not
enter
the
world
through
the
marriage
relation
stamped
with
christian
honor
a
system
of
concubinage
in
the
church
for
whose
warrant
woman
was
pointed
to
the
virgin
mary
as
an
enforcement
of
her
duty
of
absolute
surrender
of
soul
and
body
to
the
will
of
the
priest
the
course
of
the
virgin
was
adduced
who
obeyed
the
angel
gabriel
and
conceived
without
fear
of
evil
for
impurity
could
not
come
of
a
the
chastity
of
concubinage
and
the
unchasteness
of
marriage
was
constantly
asserted
by
the
church
and
thus
the
mysteries
upon
which
its
foundations
were
laid
were
used
by
it
for
the
degradation
of
woman
who
was
at
all
times
depicted
as
a
being
of
no
but
one
who
had
been
created
solely
for
man
s
pleasure
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
it
was
taught
that
a
priest
could
commit
no
sin
this
old
doctrine
took
new
strength
from
the
illumes
who
claimed
an
inner
divine
light
we
find
reference
to
priestly
immorality
and
claim
of
infallibility
among
old
writers
boccaccio
in
many
of
his
stories
putting
arguments
of
this
kind
in
the
mouth
of
his
priestly
characters
it
was
asserted
too
that
sin
was
of
the
body
alone
the
soul
knowing
nothing
partaking
nothing
of
it
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
woman
s
throwing
herself
entirely
in
the
hands
of
priests
for
immoral
purposes
it
was
declared
that
the
devout
having
offered
up
and
annihilated
their
own
selves
exist
no
longer
but
in
god
thenceforth
they
can
do
no
wrong
the
better
part
of
them
is
so
divine
that
it
no
longer
knows
what
the
other
is
in
confirmation
of
this
doctrine
it
was
said
that
jesus
threw
off
his
clothing
and
was
scourged
naked
before
the
people
the
result
of
this
teaching
was
the
almost
universal
immorality
of
christendom
under
such
religious
doctrine
it
could
but
be
expected
that
the
laity
would
closely
imitate
the
priesthood
europe
became
a
continent
of
moral
corruption
of
which
proof
is
overwhelming
could
we
but
relegate
christian
immorality
to
the
dark
ages
we
might
somewhat
palliate
it
under
plea
of
ignorance
but
unfortunately
for
such
claim
ample
proof
is
found
to
show
that
the
enlightenment
of
modern
civilization
has
not
yet
been
able
to
overthrow
the
basic
idea
upon
which
this
immorality
rests
amid
the
material
and
intellectual
advancement
of
the
last
hundred
years
we
find
spiritual
darkness
still
profound
in
the
church
and
the
true
foundation
of
immorality
almost
unrecognized
as
long
as
the
church
maintains
the
doctrine
that
woman
was
created
inferior
to
man
and
brought
sin
into
the
world
rendering
the
sacrilige
of
the
son
of
god
a
necessity
just
so
long
will
the
foundation
of
vice
and
crime
of
every
character
remain
not
until
the
exact
and
permanent
equality
of
woman
with
man
is
recognized
by
the
church
aye
even
more
the
greater
power
and
capacity
of
woman
in
the
creative
function
together
with
the
accountability
of
man
to
woman
in
everything
relating
to
the
birth
of
a
new
being
is
fully
accepted
as
a
law
of
nature
will
vice
and
crime
disappear
from
the
world
until
that
time
has
fully
come
prostitution
in
its
varied
forms
will
continue
to
exist
together
with
reformatories
jails
prisons
hospitals
and
asylums
for
the
punishment
reformation
or
care
of
the
wretched
beings
who
have
come
into
existence
with
an
inheritance
of
disease
and
crime
because
of
church
theory
and
church
teaching
the
system
of
celibacy
produced
its
same
effects
wherever
preached
so
constant
was
the
system
of
debauchery
practiced
in
england
during
the
reign
of
henry
vii
that
the
gentlemen
and
farmers
of
carnarvonshire
laid
complaint
against
the
clergy
of
systematically
seducing
their
wives
and
daughters
women
were
everywhere
looked
upon
as
slaves
and
toys
to
obey
to
furnish
pleasure
and
amusement
and
to
be
cast
aside
at
will
under
the
religious
teaching
of
christendom
it
could
not
but
be
expected
that
the
laity
would
closely
imitate
the
priesthood
and
to
victimize
women
became
the
custom
of
all
men
when
a
priest
failed
to
take
a
concubine
his
parishoners
compelled
him
to
do
so
in
order
to
preserve
the
chastity
of
their
own
wives
and
daughters
draper
tells
us
that
in
england
alone
women
became
victims
of
the
priests
houses
of
vile
character
were
maintained
for
especial
use
of
the
priesthood
the
marriage
of
a
priest
was
called
a
deception
of
the
devil
who
thus
led
him
into
an
adulterous
relation
for
sake
of
alienating
property
from
the
church
this
mediaeval
doctrine
that
sin
can
only
be
killed
through
sin
finds
expression
today
not
alone
in
religion
but
in
society
novels
its
origin
like
many
other
religious
wrongs
being
directly
traceable
to
the
teaching
of
st
paul
the
incontinence
of
these
celibate
priests
ultimately
became
so
great
a
source
of
scandal
to
the
church
that
it
was
obliged
to
take
action
edicts
and
bulls
were
fulminated
from
the
papal
chair
although
the
facts
of
history
prove
rome
itself
its
popes
and
its
cardinals
to
have
been
sunk
in
the
grossest
immorality
spain
the
seat
of
the
inquisition
and
at
that
period
the
very
heart
of
christendom
was
the
first
country
toward
which
investigation
was
turned
pope
paul
iv
issuing
a
bull
against
those
confessors
who
solicited
women
provoking
them
to
dissolute
action
when
this
bull
of
investigation
first
appeared
in
spain
it
was
accompanied
by
an
edict
commanding
all
those
who
knew
of
monks
or
priests
that
had
thus
abused
the
confessional
to
make
it
known
within
thirty
days
under
grievous
penalty
the
terrible
power
of
the
church
intimidated
those
who
otherwise
for
very
shame
would
surely
have
buried
the
guilt
of
their
priests
in
oblivion
and
so
great
was
the
number
of
women
who
thronged
the
palace
of
the
inquisition
in
the
city
of
seville
alone
that
twenty
secretaries
with
as
many
inquisitors
were
not
sufficient
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
witnesses
a
second
a
third
and
a
fourth
thirty
days
were
appointed
for
investigation
so
great
were
the
number
of
women
making
complaint
so
large
a
number
of
priests
were
implicated
that
after
a
four
months
examination
the
holy
tribunal
of
the
inquisition
put
a
stop
to
the
proceedings
commanding
that
all
those
immoralities
and
crimes
against
womanhood
only
rendered
possible
in
the
name
of
religion
and
which
has
been
proven
by
legal
evidence
should
be
buried
in
eternal
oblivion
the
deposition
of
thousands
of
women
seduced
by
their
confessors
was
not
deemed
sufficient
evidence
for
removal
of
the
guilty
priests
from
their
holy
offices
occasionally
a
single
priest
was
suspended
for
a
short
time
but
in
a
few
months
restored
again
to
his
priestly
position
it
was
not
uncommon
for
women
to
be
openly
carried
off
by
priests
their
husbands
and
fathers
threatened
with
vengeance
in
cases
of
their
attempted
recovery
during
the
height
of
the
inquisitorial
power
it
was
not
rare
for
a
family
to
be
aroused
in
the
night
by
an
ominous
knock
and
the
cry
the
holy
fathers
open
the
door
to
this
dread
mandate
there
could
be
but
one
reply
as
both
temporal
and
spiritual
power
lay
in
their
hands
a
husband
father
or
son
might
thus
be
seized
by
veiled
figures
or
as
frequently
a
loved
wife
or
young
daughter
was
dragged
from
her
bed
her
fate
ever
to
remain
a
mystery
when
young
and
beautiful
these
women
were
taken
to
replenish
the
inquisitional
harem
the
dry
pan
boiling
in
oil
and
similar
methods
of
torture
threatened
in
order
to
produce
compliance
upon
part
of
wretched
victims
no
turkish
seraglio
with
and
sack
ever
exhibited
as
great
an
amount
of
diabolical
wickedness
as
the
of
the
inquisition
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
pope
gregory
xv
commanded
strict
enforcement
of
the
bull
against
priestly
lechery
not
alone
in
spain
but
in
all
other
parts
of
the
christian
world
in
england
after
the
reformation
the
same
condition
was
found
to
exist
but
edicts
against
lasciviousness
were
vainly
issued
by
a
church
whose
foundation
is
a
belief
in
the
supremacy
of
one
sex
over
the
other
and
that
woman
brought
sin
into
the
world
through
having
seduced
man
into
the
marriage
relation
despite
the
advance
of
knowledge
and
civilization
the
effects
of
such
teachings
are
the
same
now
as
during
the
middle
ages
as
fully
proven
at
time
of
separation
between
the
temporal
and
spiritual
power
in
italy
and
these
proofs
are
taken
from
catholic
sources
in
when
the
roman
people
opened
the
palace
of
the
inquisition
there
was
found
in
the
library
a
department
entitled
summary
of
solicitations
being
a
record
of
cases
in
which
women
had
been
solicited
to
acts
of
criminality
by
their
confessors
in
the
pontifical
state
the
testimony
of
luther
as
to
the
moral
degradation
of
the
church
at
time
of
the
reformation
has
never
been
invalidated
and
is
entirely
in
accord
with
its
character
throughout
history
that
the
same
iniquities
are
connected
with
the
confessional
today
we
learn
from
the
testimony
of
those
priests
who
have
withdrawn
from
the
communion
of
the
catholic
church
father
hyacinthe
publicly
declaring
that
out
of
one
hundred
priests
live
in
sin
with
the
women
they
have
destroyed
another
priest
following
the
example
of
father
hyacinthe
in
marrying
asserted
that
he
took
this
step
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
ultramontane
slough
and
remain
an
honest
man
that
the
catholic
church
of
the
present
day
bears
the
same
general
character
it
did
during
the
middle
ages
is
proven
from
much
testimony
among
the
latest
and
most
important
witnesses
for
minuteness
and
fullness
of
detail
is
rev
charles
chiniquy
in
his
works
the
priest
the
woman
and
the
confessional
fifty
years
of
rome
etc
now
over
eighty
years
of
age
rev
chiniquy
was
for
more
than
fifty
years
a
catholic
priest
of
influence
and
high
reputation
known
in
canada
where
thousands
of
drunkards
reformed
under
his
teaching
as
the
apostle
of
becoming
convinced
of
the
immorality
of
the
romish
church
he
left
it
in
taking
with
him
five
thousand
french
canadians
with
whom
he
settled
at
anne
kankakee
county
illinois
having
united
with
a
branch
of
the
protestant
church
he
was
invited
to
scotland
to
take
part
in
the
tercentenary
of
the
reformation
and
later
to
england
where
he
lectured
on
invitation
of
ministers
of
every
evangelical
denomination
his
fifty
years
of
rome
indissolubly
links
his
name
with
that
of
abraham
lincoln
through
the
information
there
made
known
regarding
the
catholic
plot
for
president
lincoln
s
assassination
it
is
as
fully
a
law
of
moral
as
of
material
nature
that
from
the
same
causes
the
same
effects
follow
in
his
work
upon
the
confessional
rev
chiniquy
relates
incidents
coming
under
his
own
personal
knowledge
while
he
was
still
a
catholic
priest
regarding
its
present
abuses
the
character
of
the
questions
made
a
duty
of
the
priest
to
ask
during
confession
are
debasing
in
the
extreme
their
whole
tendency
towards
the
undermining
of
morality
too
broadly
indelicate
for
translation
these
priestly
instructions
are
hidden
in
latin
but
are
no
less
made
the
duty
of
a
priest
to
understand
and
use
in
a
number
of
prominent
women
of
montreal
canada
addressed
a
declaration
and
protest
to
the
bishop
of
that
diocese
against
the
abuses
of
the
confessional
of
which
their
own
experience
had
made
them
cognizant
declaration
to
his
lordship
bourget
bishop
of
montreal
god
in
his
infinite
mercy
has
been
pleased
to
show
us
the
errors
of
rome
and
has
given
us
strength
to
abandon
them
to
follow
christ
we
deem
it
our
duty
to
say
a
word
on
the
abominations
of
the
confessional
you
well
know
that
these
abominations
are
of
such
a
nature
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
to
speak
of
them
without
a
blush
how
is
it
that
among
civilized
christian
men
one
has
so
far
forgotten
the
rule
of
common
decency
as
to
force
women
to
reveal
to
unmarried
men
under
the
pains
of
eternal
damnation
their
most
secret
thoughts
their
most
sinful
desires
and
their
most
private
actions
how
unless
there
be
a
brazen
mask
on
your
priest
s
face
dare
they
go
out
into
the
world
having
heard
the
tales
of
misery
which
can
not
but
defile
the
hearing
and
which
the
women
can
not
relate
without
having
laid
aside
modesty
and
all
sense
of
shame
the
harm
would
not
be
so
great
should
the
church
allow
no
one
but
the
woman
to
accuse
herself
but
what
shall
we
say
of
the
abominable
questions
that
are
put
to
them
and
which
they
must
answer
here
the
laws
of
common
decency
strictly
forbid
us
to
enter
into
details
suffice
it
to
say
were
husbands
cognizant
of
of
what
is
going
on
between
the
confessor
and
their
wives
they
would
rather
see
them
dead
than
degraded
to
such
a
degree
as
for
us
daughters
and
wives
from
montreal
who
have
known
by
experience
the
filth
of
the
confessional
we
can
not
sufficiently
bless
god
for
having
shown
us
the
error
of
our
ways
in
teaching
us
that
it
was
not
at
the
feet
of
a
man
as
weak
and
as
sinful
as
ourselves
but
at
the
feet
of
christ
alone
that
we
must
seek
salvation

madam
in
answer
to
your
honored
letter
of
the
dec
i
hasten
to
say
the
women
of
montreal
signed
the
declaration
you
see
in
the

the
woman
and
the
confessional
in
the
fall
of
i
do
not
remember
the
day
as
it
is
ten
years
since
i
left
montreal
to
come
to
my
missionary
field
of
illinois
i
could
not
say
if
these
women
are
still
in
montreal
or
not
great
supreme
efforts
were
secretly
made
by
the
bishop
of
montreal
to
show
that
these
names
were
forged
in
order
to
answer
and
confound
me
but
the
poor
bishop
found
that
the
document
was
too
correct
authentic
and
public
to
be
answered
and
attacked
and
he
remained
mute
and
confounded
for
many
of
these
women
were
well
known
in
the
city
you
will
find
the
answer
to
your
other
questions
in
the
volume
fifty
years
in
the
church
of
rome
which
i
addressed
you
by
today
s
mail
respectfully
yours
in
christ
chiniquy
the
same
assertion
of
priestly
infallibility
is
made
today
as
it
was
centuries
ago
the
same
declaration
of
change
of
nature
through
priestly
celibacy
upon
this
question
chiniquy
says
if
any
one
wants
to
hear
an
eloquent
oration
let
him
go
where
the
roman
catholic
priest
is
preaching
on
the
divine
institution
of
auricular
confession
they
make
the
people
believe
that
the
vow
of
perpetual
chastity
changes
their
nature
turns
them
into
angels
and
puts
them
above
the
common
faults
of
the
fallen
children
of
adam
with
a
brazen
face
when
they
are
interrogated
on
that
subject
they
say
that
they
have
special
graces
to
remain
pure
and
undefiled
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
dangers
that
the
virgin
mary
to
whom
they
are
consecrated
is
their
powerful
advocate
to
obtain
from
her
son
that
superhuman
virtue
of
chastity
that
what
would
be
a
cause
of
sin
and
perdition
to
common
men
is
without
peril
and
danger
for
a
true
son
of
mary
a
work
entitled
mysteries
of
the
neapolitan
convents
its
author
henrietta
carracciola
a
woman
of
the
purest
blood
of
the
princes
of
italy
daughter
of
the
marshal
carracciola
governor
of
the
province
of
pasi
in
italy
is
quoted
from
by
rev
chiniquy
in
confirmation
of
his
statements
as
to
the
continued
impurity
of
the
confessional
finally
another
priest
the
most
annoying
of
all
for
his
obstinate
assiduity
sought
to
secure
my
affections
at
all
cost
there
was
not
an
image
profane
poetry
could
afford
him
nor
a
sophism
he
could
borrow
from
rhetoric
no
wily
interpretation
he
could
give
to
the
word
of
god
which
he
did
not
employ
to
convert
me
to
his
wishes
here
is
an
example
of
his
logic
dear
daughter
said
he
to
me
one
day
knowest
thou
who
thy
god
truly
is
he
is
the
creator
of
the
universe
i
answered
dryly
that
is
not
enough
he
replied
laughing
at
my
ignorance
god
is
love
but
love
in
the
abstract
which
receives
its
incarnation
in
the
mutual
affection
of
two
hearts
which
idolize
each
other
you
must
then
not
only
love
god
in
the
abstract
existence
but
must
also
love
him
in
his
incarnation
that
is
in
the
exclusive
love
of
a
man
who
adores
you
deus
est
amor
nec
colitus
nisi
then
i
replied
a
woman
who
adores
her
own
lover
would
adore
divinity
itself
assuredly
reiterated
the
priest
over
and
over
again
taking
courage
from
my
remark
and
chuckling
with
what
seemed
to
him
the
effect
of
his
catechism
in
that
case
said
i
hastily
i
should
select
for
my
lover
rather
a
man
of
the
world
than
a
god
preserve
you
my
daughter
god
preserve
you
from
that
sin
to
love
a
man
of
the
world
a
sinner
a
wretch
an
unbeliever
an
infidel
why
you
would
go
immediately
to
hell
the
love
of
a
priest
is
a
sacred
love
while
that
of
a
profane
man
is
infamy
the
priest
purifies
his
affections
daily
in
communion
with
the
holy
spirit
if
you
can
not
love
me
because
i
am
your
confessor
i
will
find
means
to
assist
you
to
get
rid
of
your
scruples
we
will
place
the
name
of
jesus
christ
before
all
our
affectionate
demonstrations
and
thus
our
love
will
be
a
grateful
offering
to
the
lord
and
will
ascend
fragrant
with
perfume
to
heaven
like
the
smoke
of
the
incense
of
the
sanctuary
say
to
me
for
example
i
love
you
in
jesus
christ
last
night
i
dreamed
of
you
in
jesus
christ
and
you
will
have
tranquil
conscience
because
in
doing
this
god
will
sanctify
every
transport
of
your
rev
chiniquy
who
in
his
fifty
years
of
romish
priesthood
possessed
every
opportunity
for
knowing
the
truth
does
not
hesitate
to
affirm
that
the
popes
are
today
of
the
same
general
immoral
character
they
were
in
the
earlier
centuries
of
the
church
he
says
let
not
my
readers
be
deceived
by
the
idea
that
the
popes
of
rome
in
our
days
are
much
better
than
those
of
the
ninth
tenth
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
they
are
absolutely
the
only
difference
is
that
today
they
take
a
little
more
care
to
conceal
their
secret
orgies
go
to
italy
and
there
the
roman
catholics
themselves
will
show
you
the
two
beautiful
daughters
whom
the
late
pope
pius
ix
had
from
two
of
his
mistresses
inquire
from
those
who
have
personally
known
pope
gregory
xvi
the
predecessor
of
pius
ix
after
they
will
have
given
you
the
history
of
his
mistresses
one
of
whom
was
the
wife
of
his
barber
they
will
tell
you
that
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
drunkards
in
italy
the
views
of
the
catholic
church
in
regard
to
marriage
of
the
priesthood
was
recently
demonstrated
in
the
united
states
by
the
persecution
of
a
priest
of
the
uniate
greek
church
sent
as
a
missionary
from
austria
to
pennsylvania
the
greek
church
it
must
be
remembered
permits
a
single
marriage
to
a
priest
the
uniate
while
in
this
respect
following
the
discipline
of
the
greek
church
yet
admits
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
which
the
regular
greek
church
does
not
the
uniate
greek
church
accepts
as
binding
all
the
decisions
of
rome
subsequent
to
the
division
between
the
eastern
and
the
western
parts
of
christendom
endowed
with
authority
from
both
branches
father
wolonski
came
to
this
country
accompanied
by
his
wife
in
full
expectation
of
fellowship
with
his
catholic
brethren
his
first
contrary
experience
occurred
in
philadelphia
when
archbishop
ryan
of
the
cathedral
refused
all
intercourse
with
him
because
of
his
marriage
reaching
shenandoah
where
commissioned
by
his
own
austrian
bishop
he
discovered
himself
still
under
ban
the
resident
priest
of
the
catholic
church
having
warned
his
congregation
under
pain
of
excommunication
to
shun
both
himself
and
his
church
upon
the
ground
that
the
roman
church
under
no
circumstances
tolerated
a
married
priest
eventually
the
subject
grew
to
such
proportions
that
father
wolonski
was
recalled
and
an
unmarried
priest
sent
in
his
stead
from
the
experience
of
father
wolonski
less
than
a
decade
since
with
the
bitter
hostility
shown
by
the
church
towards
father
hyacinthe
we
find
that
a
belief
in
the
special
holiness
of
celibacy
is
as
dominant
in
the
catholic
church
today
as
at
any
period
of
its
history
concurrent
testimony
teaching
us
that
its
greatest
evils
remain
the
same
as
of
old
it
is
less
than
twenty
years
since
the
whole
christian
world
was
interested
in
a
suit
brought
against
the
heirs
of
the
deceased
cardinal
antonelli
in
order
to
secure
recognition
of
his
daughter
s
claim
to
inheritance
this
girl
was
everywhere
spoken
of
by
the
catholic
church
as
a
sacrilegious
child
that
is
a
being
who
had
violated
sacred
things
by
coming
into
existence
the
destruction
of
her
mother
s
life
her
own
illegitimacy
the
wrong
done
to
her
mother
s
family
and
to
society
were
held
as
of
no
moment
beside
the
fact
that
her
claims
if
allowed
would
take
property
from
the
church
the
love
of
the
great
cardinal
for
this
girl
s
mother
was
fully
proven
but
the
church
having
established
celibacy
in
order
that
it
might
control
the
property
of
its
priests
was
not
inclined
to
permit
any
portion
to
be
diverted
from
that
source
honesty
justice
and
the
ties
of
natural
affection
now
as
of
yore
are
not
part
of
the
church
system
in
consequence
this
suit
of
the
illegitimate
child
of
the
great
cardinal
secretary
filled
not
alone
italy
but
the
whole
catholic
world
with
disgrace
among
the
countries
now
striving
to
free
themselves
from
church
dominion

a

of
regarding
the
revolution
there
in
progress
said
of
diaz
instead
of
his
being
assisted
by
the
church
it
has
been
his
bitterest
and
most
relentless
enemy
and
opponent
the
church
in
mexico
is
opposed
to
all
enlightenment
of
the
people
the
clergy
if
they
can
be
honored
with
that
name
fight
all
improvements
they
want
no
railways
or
telegraphs
and
when
he
adopted
a
system
of
compulsory
education
the
war
began
in
earnest
diaz
was
determined
however
and
he
retaliated
by
closing
up
the
convents
and
prohibiting
the
establishment
of
monasteries
being
further
opposed
in
his
efforts
at
reform
and
defied
by
the
priests
he
put
hundreds
of
them
in
pueblo
in
jail
and
prohibited
the
ringing
of
church
bells
in
certain
localities
he
forcibly
impressed
on
them
the
fact
that
he
was
running
mexico
not
they
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
his
idea
of
christianity
was
that
priests
should
preach
christ
crucified
and
not
revolution
and
infraction
of
the
laws
in
mexico
priests
can
keep
mistresses
with
impunity
from
a
church
to
a
is
but
a
step
and
the
priests
gamble
with
the
rest
the
rentals
of
houses
of
of
of
all
go
to
a
church
which
is
supposed
to
teach
religion
because
diaz
a
catholic
himself
will
not
tolerate
such
crimes
under
the
guise
of
religion
he
is
fought
by
the
church
and
is
the
recipient
of
their
anathemas
take
the
leading
church
in
monterey
outside
of
the
cathedral
you
step
from
the
to
a
plaza
owned
by
the
church
and
in
which
stand
fifty
tents
in
which
are
conducted
monte
roulette
and
other
games
of
chance
behind
this
stand
the
and
the
profits
and
rentals
go
to
the
church
with
all
these
lights
the
most
plausible
inference
or
theory
is
that
the
clerical
party
as
they
see
all
these
privileges
being
swept
away
will
cheerfully
contribute
the
sinews
of
war
with
which
to
carry
on
a
revolution
against
diaz
they
have
agents
in
europe
and
the
money
can
come
through
that
source
without
detection
the
agent
of
the
clerical
party
in
europe
is
the
church
itself
as
a
body
it
has
ever
opposed
advancement
and
reform
it
anathematized
the
printing
press
as
an
invention
of
the
devil
and
has
steadily
opposed
education
of
the
people
its
work
is
best
done
in
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
superstition
for
this
cause
it
has
opposed
all
new
discoveries
in
science
all
reforms
of
whatever
character
not
by
the
catholic
church
alone
but
under
the
reformation
as
we
have
seen
the
same
prohibition
of
the
bible
to
common
people
has
existed
the
same
resistance
to
education
of
the
masses
the
same
opposition
to
to
temperance
to
woman
s
demand
for
equality
of
opportunity
with
man
the
general
nature
of
the
church
does
not
change
with
change
of
name
looking
backward
through
history
we
even
find
the
same
characteristics
under
the
patriarchate
love
of
power
greed
for
money
and
intense
selfishness
combined
in
a
general
disregard
for
the
rights
of
others
renan
s
drama
l
abbesse
de
jouarre
was
written
because
he
wished
to
prove
the
worthlessness
of
those
vows
imposed
on
catholic
priests
and
nuns
as
well
as
show
the
bondage
under
which
they
held
the
feminine
conscience
while
the
masculine
conscience
throws
them
aside
it
is
not
alone
the
nuns
whose
conscience
is
bound
but
all
feminine
members
of
the
catholic
church
are
more
closely
held
in
a
spiritual
bondage
than
the
male
members
of
that
church
in
a
letter
from
chili
to
the
york
graphically
pictured
certain
chilian
women
penitents
who
are
known
by
a
peculiar
dress
they
are
required
to
wear
others
whose
sins
are
so
great
that
they
can
not
be
purged
by
a
penitential
dress
retire
for
a
season
to
the
convent
of
penitents
where
by
mortification
of
the
body
they
hope
to
gain
absolution
for
the
soul
still
more
severe
than
this
retreat
are
other
convents
known
as
houses
of
detention
where
wayward
daughters
are
sent
and
young
mothers
without
husbands
are
cared
for
but
the
whole
country
of
chili
fails
to
show
a
similar
dress
or
house
of
penitence
or
correction
for
men
shame
and
penance
equally
with
sin
have
been
relegated
by
the
church
to
women
alone
the
confessional
is
not
frequented
by
men
and
mass
is
but
seldom
attended
by
them
for
this
laxity
a
double
reason
exists
first
immorality
in
men
is
not
looked
upon
as
contrary
to
its
discipline
second
through
woman
having
been
trained
to
a
more
sensitive
conscience
than
man
the
confessional
wrests
secrets
from
her
lips
which
gives
the
church
knowledge
of
all
it
wishes
to
learn
in
regard
to
the
family
no
more
certain
system
could
have
been
devised
for
the
destruction
of
woman
s
than
the
one
requiring
penance
from
her
for
sins
the
church
passes
lightly
over
in
man
nor
would
penance
of
this
character
be
demanded
from
women
were
the
offices
of
the
church
open
to
her
the
same
as
to
man
no
greater
crime
against
humanity
has
ever
been
known
than
the
division
of
morality
into
two
codes
the
strict
for
woman
the
lax
for
man
nor
has
woman
been
the
sole
sufferer
from
this
creation
of
two
moral
codes
within
the
christian
church
through
it
man
has
lost
fine
discrimination
between
good
and
evil
and
the
church
itself
as
the
originator
of
this
distinction
in
sin
upon
the
trend
of
sex
has
become
the
creator
and
sustainer
of
injustice
falsehood
and
the
crimes
into
which
its
priests
have
most
deeply
sunk
nor
is
this
condition
of
the
past
as
late
as
the
fall
of
a
number
of
articles
appeared
in
canadian
papers
openly
accusing
the
catholic
priesthood
of
that
province
of
the
grossest
immorality
that
priestly
celibacy
yet
continues
in
the
romish
church
is
not
a
subject
of
surprise
when
we
realize
the
immense
power
and
wealth
it
has
been
enabled
to
secure
through
its
means
but
it
is
one
of
astonishment
carrying
with
it
a
premonition
of
danger
that
we
now
see
a
similar
tendency
in
the
ritualistic
portion
of
the
episcopal
church
both
in
england
and
the
united
states
the
evils
of
monasticism
although
less
potent
than
during
the
middle
ages
are
still
great
and
in
finding
entrance
into
protestant
denominations
are
a
fresh
warning
of
their
dangerous
tendency
the
experience
of
the
past
should
not
appeal
to
us
in
vain
we
have
noticed
the
perils
to
society
arising
from
those
classes
of
persons
who
under
plea
of
religion
evade
the
duties
of
family
and
social
life
no
crime
against
the
world
can
be
greater
than
the
deliberate
divestment
of
responsibility
by
one
s
self
because
tired
of
the
warfare
of
life
that
struggle
which
comes
to
every
human
being
the
becoming
fascinated
with
the
conceptions
of
an
existence
outside
of
ordinary
cares
and
the
entrance
into
an
order
in
which
one
s
own
personal
responsibility
is
largely
surrendered
to
others
is
not
alone
a
crime
against
the
state
but
a
sin
against
one
s
own
self
and
against
humanity
an
order
which
thereafter
assumes
the
task
of
directing
the
thoughts
and
lives
of
its
members
into
a
channel
of
repose
and
contentment
as
certain
protestant
orders
do
is
one
of
the
dangerous
religious
elements
of
the
present
day
no
crime
against
one
s
self
or
against
society
can
be
greater
than
this
in
the
ritualistic
episcopal
church
are
to
be
found
monks
and
sisterhoods
upon
the
celibate
plan
confessors
and
penance
all
of
them
primal
elements
in
moral
and
spiritual
degradation
if
religion
has
a
lesson
to
teach
mankind
it
is
that
of
personal
responsibility
it
is
that
of
the
worth
and
duty
of
the
individual
it
is
that
each
human
being
is
alone
accountable
for
his
or
her
course
in
life
it
is
the
lesson
of
the
absolute
equality
of
each
human
being
with
every
other
human
being
in
relation
to
these
cardinal
points
the
lesson
should
have
been
learned
ere
this
that
ecclesiastical
pretense
of
divinely
appointed
power
has
ever
made
the
priesthood
arrogant
coarse
and
tyrannical
the
male
laity
dependent
and
dissimulating
woman
and
timorous
believing
in
the
duty
of
humiliation
and
that
her
life
is
not
to
be
lived
primarily
for
herself
alone
but
that
her
very
right
to
existence
is
dependent
upon
the
benefit
thereby
to
accrue
to
some
other
person
today
as
of
old
the
underlying
idea
of
monasticism
of
brotherhoods
sisterhoods
and
their
ilk
even
in
protestant
denominations
is
the
divine
authority
of
some
priestly
superior
and
that
the
power
of
remitting
sins
inheres
in
some
system
under
control
of
some
priest
the
ritualistic
party
of
the
episcopal
church
equally
with
the
roman
catholic
church
makes
frequent
reference
to
these
words
of
john
xx
whatever
sins
you
remit
they
are
remitted
unto
them
and
whatsoever
sins
you
retain
are
retained
thus
premising
the
divine
power
of
the
priesthood
the
earliest
saxon
laws
were
almost
entirely
ecclesiastical
their
basis
seeming
to
have
been
payment
of
tithes
to
the
church
and
support
of
the
pope
through
what
was
known
as
the
hearth
penny
to
peter
marriage
was
by
no
means
allowed
to
escape
general
ecclesiastical
control
its
legitimacy
being
made
to
depend
upon
the
sanction
and
services
of
a
priest
this
we
learn
from
reeves
whose
authority
is
indisputable
therefore
we
discover
that
even
long
before
marriage
was
constituted
one
of
the
sacraments
celibacy
or
the
confessional
established
the
church
had
perceived
the
great
increase
in
its
authority
to
be
brought
about
by
gaining
control
of
the
marriage
ceremony
and
making
its
legitimacy
depend
upon
the
services
of
a
priest
this
was
a
material
step
towards
the
subjugation
of
mankind
one
whose
dire
consequences
have
not
yet
received
due
consideration
when
rome
became
a
christian
state
and
the
phallic
cross
triumphed
over
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
old
the
condition
of
woman
under
the
civil
law
became
more
degraded
the
change
from
ancient
civilization
to
that
renewed
barbarism
at
an
early
age
of
the
christian
era
which
so
many
writers
note
without
perceiving
its
cause
is
to
be
found
in
the
low
conception
of
womanhood
inculcated
by
the
church
ignorance
superstition
falsehood
and
forgery
united
in
creating
new
codes
of
law
new
customs
of
society
new
habits
of
thought
which
having
for
centuries
been
imposed
upon
mankind
by
the
united
force
of
the
church
and
the
state
still
continue
their
impress
upon
modern
life
and
law
among
general
canons
we
find
that
no
woman
may
approach
the
a
woman
may
not
baptize
without
extreme
woman
may
not
receive
the
eucharist
under
a
black
woman
may
not
receive
the
eucharist
in
suo
at
the
synod
or
council
of
elvira
or
several
restrictive
canons
were
formulated
against
woman
under
canon
she
was
forbidden
to
write
in
her
own
name
to
lay
christians
but
only
in
the
name
of
her
husband
women
were
not
to
receive
letters
of
friendship
from
any
one
addressed
only
to
themselves
from
the
commencement
of
the
fifth
century
the
christian
clergy
acquired
a
powerful
influence
in
rome
bishops
and
priests
were
the
municipal
magistrates
of
the
roman
empire
of
which
little
now
remained
except
its
municipal
government
thus
the
church
in
reality
became
rome
and
rome
the
church
it
has
been
declared
difficult
to
fix
with
precision
the
period
at
which
ecclesiastics
first
began
to
claim
exemption
from
civil
jurisdiction
the
synod
of
paris
seems
to
have
secured
to
the
clergy
the
privilege
of
being
brought
before
mixed
tribunals
in
all
cases
which
had
theretofore
belonged
to
the
civil
judge
alone
bishops
acquired
greater
power
from
having
an
oversight
over
the
whole
administration
of
justice
committed
to
them
while
their
spiritual
judgments
were
rendered
more
effective
by
the
addition
of
excommunication
to
civil
punishments
the
state
at
first
holding
repression
over
the
church
added
to
its
powers
by
relieving
the
clergy
from
all
civil
duties
thus
tending
to
make
of
them
a
body
exterior
to
the
civil
government
this
division
was
farther
increased
through
the
emperors
giving
confirmation
to
the
decisions
pronounced
by
bishops
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
and
also
when
they
were
chosen
umpires
in
civil
suits
the
tendency
of
this
action
was
towards
the
creation
of
an
ecclesiastical
law
with
separate
powers
from
the
civil
law
another
step
towards
the
separation
of
civil
from
ecclesiastical
law
and
the
supremacy
of
the
latter
was
made
when
in
cases
of
discipline
the
clergy
were
allowed
to
come
under
the
authority
and
supervision
of
the
spiritual
courts
as
soon
as
christianity
became
the
religion
of
the
state
this
power
was
still
farther
increased
by
the
permission
accorded
ecclesiastics
to
accept
gifts
inherit
and
hold
property
the
purity
of
clerical
motives
being
thereby
greatly
lessened
as
covetous
and
unscrupulous
persons
were
forthwith
attracted
to
this
profession
the
law
of
tithes
was
introduced
by
charlemagne
and
his
edicts
largely
increased
clerical
power
the
compilation
of
a
code
of
canon
law
was
begun
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
by
which
period
the
olden
acknowledged
rights
of
the
clergy
those
of
superintending
morals
and
interference
on
behalf
of
the
unfortunate
had
largely
been
lost
sight
of
or
diverted
from
their
proper
course
by
a
system
of
ecclesiastical
tyranny
which
created
an
order
of
morals
whose
sole
design
was
that
of
building
up
priestly
power
the
complete
inferiority
and
subordination
of
the
female
sex
was
maintained
both
by
civil
and
common
law
it
was
a
principle
of
common
law
that
sons
should
be
admitted
to
an
inheritance
before
daughters
this
distinction
created
by
the
church
in
the
interests
of
the
class
which
was
alone
admitted
to
the
priesthood
thus
placing
the
possession
of
wealth
in
the
hands
of
man
did
much
towards
keeping
woman
in
a
subordinate
condition
in
accordance
with
natural
law
the
person
not
owning
property
is
less
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
state
than
the
one
possessing
it
a
denial
of
the
rights
of
ownership
acting
prejudicially
upon
the
individual
ecclesiastical
or
canon
law
made
its
greatest
encroachments
at
the
period
when
chivalry
was
at
its
height
the
outward
show
of
respect
and
honor
to
woman
under
chivalry
keeping
pace
in
its
false
pretence
with
the
destruction
of
her
legal
rights
the
general
conception
in
regard
to
woman
was
so
degraded
at
this
period
that
a
community
of
women
was
proposed
to
whom
all
men
should
act
in
the
relation
of
husbands
this
plan
was
advocated
by
jean
de
meung
the
poet
of
chivalry
in
his
famous
de
la
christine
of
pisa
a
woman
of
learning
and
remarkable
force
of
character
the
first
strictly
literary
woman
of
western
europe
wrote
a
work
in
defense
of
her
sex
against
the
general
libidinous
character
of
the
age
her
opposition
to
the
debasing
theories
of
the
romance
marks
the
later
period
of
woman
s
entrance
into
literature
and
is
an
era
from
which
dates
the
modern
intellectual
development
of
europe
efforts
to
utterly
crush
the
moral
rectitude
of
women
through
the
adoption
of
those
base
ideas
of
phallic
origin
having
been
the
systematic
course
of
the
church
the
state
and
society
through
many
hundred
years
it
is
a
most
notable
proof
of
her
innate
disbelief
in
this
teaching
that
woman
s
first
literary
work
of
modern
times
was
written
in
opposition
to
such
a
powerfully
sustained
theory
as
to
her
innate
depravity
christine
asserted
the
common
humanity
of
woman
entirely
repudiating
the
sensual
ideas
of
the
times
to
the
credit
of
mankind
it
must
be
recorded
that
the
laity
did
not
unresistingly
yield
to
priestly
power
but
made
many
attempts
to
take
their
temporal
concerns
from
under
priestly
control
but
under
the
general
paucity
of
education
and
the
abnegation
of
the
will
so
sedulously
inculcated
by
the
church
as
the
supreme
duty
of
the
laity
its
dread
power
brought
to
bear
in
the
enforcement
of
its
teaching
by
terrifying
threats
of
excommunication
and
future
eternal
torment
the
rights
of
even
the
male
portion
of
the
people
were
gradually
lost
the
control
of
the
priesthood
over
all
things
of
a
temporal
as
well
as
of
a
spiritual
nature
tended
to
make
them
a
distinct
body
from
the
laity
in
pursuance
of
its
aims
for
universal
dominion
the
church
saw
the
necessity
of
assuming
control
of
temporal
affairs
rights
were
divided
into
those
pertaining
to
persons
and
things
the
rights
of
persons
belonged
to
the
priesthood
alone
but
inasmuch
as
every
man
whatever
his
condition
could
become
a
priest
and
no
woman
however
learned
or
pious
or
high
in
station
could
be
admitted
to
its
ranks
the
whole
tendency
of
ecclesiastical
law
was
to
divide
mankind
into
a
holy
or
divine
sex
and
an
unholy
or
impious
one
thus
canon
law
still
farther
separated
those
whose
interests
were
the
same
creating
an
antagonism
in
the
minds
of
all
men
against
all
women
which
bearing
upon
all
business
of
ordinary
life
between
men
and
women
fell
with
its
greatest
weight
upon
women
it
corrupted
the
common
law
of
england
and
perverted
the
civil
codes
of
other
nations
under
canon
law
wives
were
deprived
of
the
control
of
both
person
and
property
while
sisters
were
not
allowed
to
inherit
with
brothers
property
according
to
old
ecclesiastical
language
going
to
the
worthiest
of
blackstone
acknowledges
that
this
distinction
between
brothers
and
sisters
reflects
shame
upon
england
and
was
no
part
of
the
old
roman
law
under
which
the
children
of
a
family
inherited
equally
without
distinction
of
sex
it
was
as
late
as
before
the
canon
law
in
regard
to
the
sole
inheritance
of
sons
was
repealed
in
one
of
the
swiss
cantons
the
influence
of
this
law
in
creating
selfishness
was
manifested
by
the
opposition
it
met
brothers
piteously
asserting
ruin
to
themselves
by
this
act
of
justice
to
their
sisters
whenever
the
canon
law
is
analyzed
it
is
found
destructive
to
the
higher
moral
sentiments
of
humanity
a
woman
was
prohibited
the
priesthood
and
as
the
property
of
men
entering
orders
became
forfeited
to
the
church
the
real
intent
of
this
of
obtaining
control
of
otherwise
might
have
escaped
the
grasping
hand
of
the
church
is
easily
discernible
from
its
first
theory
of
woman
s
inferiority
to
its
last
struggle
for
power
at
the
present
day
the
influence
and
action
of
the
patriarchate
is
clearly
seen
the
touch
of
the
church
upon
family
life
inheritance
and
education
increased
the
power
of
the
patriarchate
as
celibacy
proved
a
lucrative
method
of
bringing
wealth
into
its
coffers
so
marriage
was
early
made
a
source
of
revenue
to
the
church
canon
law
creating
it
a
sacrament
to
be
performed
at
the
church
door
owing
however
to
the
innate
sinfulness
of
marriage
this
sacrament
was
not
for
many
years
allowed
to
take
place
within
the
sacred
building
dedicated
to
god
and
deemed
too
holy
to
permit
the
entrance
of
a
woman
within
its
sacred
walls
at
certain
periods
of
her
life
in
order
to
secure
full
control
of
this
relation
marriage
unblessed
by
a
priest
was
declared
to
be
concubinage
and
carried
with
it
deprivation
of
church
privileges
which
the
ignorance
of
the
people
held
to
be
of
vital
importance
in
entering
this
relation
the
wife
was
compelled
to
relinquish
her
name
her
property
the
control
of
her
person
her
own
sacred
individuality
and
to
promise
obedience
to
her
husband
in
all
things
certain
hours
of
the
day
to
suit
the
convenience
of
priests
were
set
aside
as
canonical
after
which
time
no
marriage
could
be
celebrated
nor
has
this
priestly
control
of
marriage
been
confined
to
the
catholics
alone
similar
laws
were
extant
after
the
reformation
in
england
canon
instituted
that
under
penalty
of
suspension
people
could
not
marry
except
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
twelve
in
the
forenoon
nor
was
marriage
then
allowed
in
any
private
place
but
must
be
performed
at
the
church
door
the
rapid
growth
of
the
canon
law
in
england
must
be
ascribed
to
avarice
the
denial
to
wives
of
any
right
of
property
in
the
marital
union
being
an
example
at
this
period
canon
law
began
to
take
cognizance
of
crimes
establishing
an
equivalent
in
money
for
every
species
of
wrong
doing
the
church
not
only
remitted
penalty
for
crimes
already
committed
but
sold
indulgences
for
the
commission
of
new
ones
its
touch
soon
extended
to
all
relations
of
life
marriages
within
the
seventh
degree
were
forbidden
by
the
church
as
incestuous
but
to
those
able
to
pay
for
such
indulgences
a
dispensation
for
such
incestuous
marriage
was
readily
granted
no
crime
so
great
it
could
not
be
condoned
for
money
thus
through
canon
law
was
seen
the
anomaly
of
legal
marriage
between
the
laity
pronounced
concubinage
while
the
concubines
of
priests
were
termed
as
soon
as
the
legality
of
marriage
was
made
dependent
upon
priestly
sanction
the
door
of
gross
immorality
was
widely
opened
all
restrictions
connected
with
this
relation
were
made
to
fall
with
heaviest
weight
upon
woman
husbands
were
secured
the
right
of
separation
for
causes
not
freeing
wives
even
the
adultery
of
the
husband
was
not
deemed
sufficient
cause
unless
he
brought
his
mistress
into
the
same
house
with
his
wife
church
and
state
sustained
each
other
conviction
of
the
husband
for
a
capital
crime
gave
the
wife
no
release
from
the
marriage
bond
yet
in
case
of
the
husband
s
treason
his
innocent
wife
and
children
were
robbed
of
all
share
in
the
estate
of
the
criminal
husband
and
father
and
were
reduced
to
beggary
his
estate
escheating
to
the
state
as
under
civil
law
so
under
ecclesiastical
the
church
recognized
but
slight
difference
in
the
guilt
of
a
contumacious
husband
and
that
of
his
pious
wife
and
children
it
was
a
principle
of
the
church
that
the
innocent
must
suffer
for
the
guilty
especially
when
the
innocent
were
women
and
children
powerless
to
aid
themselves
at
its
every
step
canon
law
injured
woman
the
clergy
assuming
to
be
an
order
of
spiritual
beings
claimed
immunity
from
civil
law
and
allowed
for
themselves
an
arrest
of
judgment
ultimately
enlarged
so
as
to
include
all
male
persons
who
could
read
and
write
this
arrest
known
as
benefit
of
clergy
was
denied
to
all
women
who
were
liable
to
sentence
of
death
for
the
first
crime
of
simple
larceny
bigamy
etc
men
who
by
virtue
of
sex
could
become
priests
if
able
to
read
were
for
the
same
crimes
punished
by
simple
branding
in
the
hand
or
a
few
months
imprisonment
while
a
woman
was
drawn
and
burned
alive
did
not
history
furnish
much
proof
of
this
character
it
would
be
impossible
to
believe
that
such
barbaric
injustice
was
part
of
english
law
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
woman
first
rendered
ineligible
to
the
priesthood
was
then
punished
for
this
ineligibility
blackstone
recognizes
as
among
the
remarkable
legal
events
of
the
kingdom
the
great
alteration
in
the
laws
through
the
separation
of
ecclesiastical
courts
from
the
civil
matrimonial
causes
or
injuries
respecting
the
rights
of
marriage
are
recognized
by
him
as
quite
an
undisturbed
branch
of
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
from
the
church
having
so
early
converted
this
contract
into
a
sacramental
ordinance
during
many
centuries
education
was
denied
to
woman
in
christian
countries
for
reasons
connected
with
her
ineligibility
to
the
priesthood
the
art
of
reading
is
by
scholars
believed
to
have
been
one
of
the
ancient
mysteries
taught
at
eleusis
and
other
olden
temples
learning
then
as
at
later
periods
was
in
the
hands
of
priests
therefore
the
fact
of
being
able
to
read
was
synonymous
with
the
right
of
entering
the
priesthood
this
right
appertained
to
women
in
many
ancient
nations
even
under
the
patriarchate
higgins
shows
that
the
word
from
which
our
words
liberty
freedom
are
derived
is
one
and
the
same
as
a
book
and
had
close
connection
with
the
intellectual
literary
and
priestly
class
as
under
christian
doctrine
the
priesthood
was
denied
to
woman
so
under
the
same
rule
learning
was
prohibited
to
her
to
permit
woman
s
education
under
christianity
would
have
been
a
virtual
concession
of
her
right
to
the
priesthood
in
not
allowing
her
benefit
of
clergy
the
priests
were
but
consistent
with
themselves
and
their
pretensions
as
to
the
superior
holiness
of
the
male
sex
that
a
woman
should
be
burned
alive
for
a
crime
whose
only
punishment
for
a
man
was
a
few
months
imprisonment
was
in
unison
with
the
whole
teaching
of
the
christian
church
regarding
woman
under
canon
law
many
of
the
shields
theretofore
thrown
about
women
were
removed
punishment
for
crimes
against
them
lessened
while
crimes
committed
by
them
were
more
severely
punished
rape
which
in
early
english
history
was
termed
felony
its
penalty
death
was
regarded
in
a
less
heinous
light
under
clerical
rule
under
the
political
constitutions
of
the
saxons
bishops
had
seats
in
the
national
council
and
all
laws
were
prefaced
by
a
formal
declaration
of
their
consent
by
their
influence
it
became
a
general
law
that
a
woman
could
never
take
of
an
inheritance
with
a
man
unless
perhaps
by
the
particular
and
ancient
customs
of
some
cities
or
towns
while
daughters
at
a
father
s
death
could
be
left
totally
unprovided
for
a
law
was
enacted
in
the
reign
of
edward
vi
that
no
son
should
be
passed
over
in
his
father
s
will
unless
disinherited
in
plain
terms
and
a
just
cause
given
in
case
of
daughters
sex
was
deemed
a
just
cause
for
leaving
them
in
poverty
the
earlier
laws
of
the
danish
knut
or
canute
show
that
the
estate
was
then
divided
among
all
the
children
under
canon
law
the
testimony
of
a
woman
was
not
received
in
a
court
of
justice
she
was
depicted
by
the
church
as
the
source
of
all
evil
the
mother
of
every
legislation
had
the
apparent
aim
of
freeing
the
clergy
from
all
responsibility
to
the
civil
or
moral
law
and
placing
the
weight
of
every
sin
or
crime
upon
woman
a
council
at
tivoli
in
the
soisonnais
presided
over
by
twelve
bishops
promulgated
a
canon
requiring
the
oath
of
seven
persons
to
convict
a
priest
with
having
lived
with
a
woman
if
their
oath
failed
of
clearing
him
he
was
allowed
to
justify
himself
upon
his
sole
oath
under
canon
law
a
woman
could
not
bring
an
accusation
unless
prosecuted
for
an
injury
done
to
herself
it
is
less
than
thirty
years
since
this
law
was
extant
in
scotland
and
as
late
as
that
through
the
influence
of
signor
morelli
the
italian
parliament
repealed
the
old
restriction
existant
in
that
country
regarding
woman
s
testimony
under
canon
law
a
woman
could
not
be
witness
in
ecclesiastical
or
criminal
suits
nor
attest
a
will
to
cast
doubts
upon
a
person
s
word
is
indicative
of
the
most
supreme
contempt
importing
discredit
to
the
whole
character
that
a
woman
was
not
allowed
to
attest
a
will
nor
become
a
witness
in
ecclesiastical
suits
implied
great
degradation
and
is
a
very
strong
proof
of
the
low
esteem
in
which
woman
was
held
both
by
state
and
church
that
a
priest
could
clear
himself
upon
his
own
unsubstantiated
oath
is
equally
significative
of
the
respect
in
which
this
office
was
held
as
well
as
showing
the
degree
in
which
all
law
was
made
to
shield
man
and
degrade
woman
when
we
find
the
oath
of
seven
women
required
to
nullify
that
of
one
layman
we
need
no
stronger
testimony
as
to
woman
s
inequality
before
the
law
canonists
laid
down
the
law
for
all
matters
of
a
temporal
nature
whether
civil
or
criminal
the
buying
and
selling
of
lands
leasing
mortgaging
contracts
the
descent
of
inheritance
the
prosecution
and
punishment
of
murder
theft
detection
of
thieves
frauds
those
and
many
other
objects
of
temporal
jurisdiction
were
provided
for
by
canon
law
it
was
intended
that
the
clergy
should
come
entirely
under
its
action
governed
as
a
distinct
people
from
the
laity
the
principal
efforts
of
the
canon
law
towards
which
all
its
enactments
tended
was
the
subordination
of
woman
and
the
elevation
of
the
hierarchy
to
secure
these
two
ends
the
church
did
not
hesitate
at
forgery
for
many
hundred
years
a
collection
of
decretals
or
what
were
claimed
as
decrees
of
the
early
popes
carried
great
authority
although
later
investigation
has
proven
them
forgeries
civil
as
well
as
ecclesiastical
laws
were
forged
in
the
interest
of
the
priesthood
a
noted
instance
was
the
once
famous
law
of
constantine
which
endowed
bishops
with
unlimited
power
giving
them
jurisdiction
in
all
kinds
of
causes
this
law
declared
that
whatever
is
determined
by
the
judgment
of
bishops
shall
always
be
held
as
sacred
and
venerable
and
that
in
all
kinds
of
causes
whether
they
are
tried
according
to
the
pastoral
or
civil
law
that
it
is
law
to
be
forever
observed
by
all
the
famous
seldon
known
as
the
light
of
england
declares
it
to
have
been
a
prodigious
and
monstrous
jurisdiction
assumed
by
the
priestly
order
by
means
of
falsehood
and
forgery
the
two
classes
of
temporal
affairs
that
spiritual
courts
especially
endeavored
to
appropriate
were
marriages
and
wills
with
everything
bearing
upon
them
in
these
the
greatest
oppression
fell
upon
women
canon
law
gradually
acquired
enormous
power
through
the
control
it
gained
over
wills
the
guardianship
of
orphans
marriage
and
divorce
as
soon
as
ecclesiastical
courts
were
divided
from
the
temporal
in
england
a
new
set
of
principles
and
maxims
began
to
prevail
this
was
one
of
the
first
effects
of
the
conquest
but
in
robert
kilmandy
dean
of
canterbury
gave
directions
for
the
restoration
and
observation
of
the
ancient
and
neglected
laws
of
ecclesiastical
courts
of
these
the
court
of
arches
was
one
of
the
most
ancient
it
is
almost
impossible
to
fix
the
date
of
ecclesiastical
rule
unless
indeed
we
go
back
to
the
very
foundation
of
the
church
as
noted
the
early
saxons
were
largely
governed
by
their
priests
in
at
the
paris
synod
the
clergy
were
given
authority
in
matters
theretofore
under
civil
power
while
in
england
we
find
priestly
power
to
have
been
great
during
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
bracton
sets
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
between
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
and
end
of
the
thirteenth
centuries
as
the
period
when
this
power
took
its
greatest
strides
at
this

bequests
the

of

the

and
all

concerns
having
broken
over

of

this
period
covers
the
establishment
of

with
the
trains
of
evils
noted
in
the
preceding
chapter
when
the
marriage
of
priests
was
declared
invalid
their

branded
as
immoral
persons
and
stain
of
illegitimacy
thrown
upon
their
children
despite
the
guarantees
of
the
runnymede
charter
and
the
religious
rebellion
of
the
eighth
henry
despite
the
vigor
of
elizabeth
who
bent
both
priest
and
prelate
to
her
fiery
will
the
influence
of
this
period
moved
down
in
line
with
the
reformation
and
to
the
injury
of
woman
successfully
incorporated
its
worst
features
into
the
common
law
the
new
church
social
and
family
life
all
partaking
of
this
injustice
a
great
number
of
canons
were
enacted
after
the
reformation
these
together
with
the
foreign
canons
which
had
been
adopted
were
held
as
part
of
the
law
of
england
the
episcopal
church
appropriated
numerous
canons
extant
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
several
of
these
having
been
created
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
church
at
a
period
when
the
temporal
power
threatened
encroachment
the
archdeacon
of
surrey
prepared
a
voluminous
work
upon
this
subject
known
as
the
jurus
proving
that
these
canons
decrees
when
falling
into
disuse
had
been
established
by
act
of
parliament
as
part
of
the
law
of
england
the
preface
of
his
work
declared
that
it
had
been
prepared
purely
for
the
service
of
the
clergy
and
in
support
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
church
thus
we
have
direct
proof
of
the
adoption
of
papal
decrees
as
part
of
the
government
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
also
as
part
of
english
law
an
act
of
parliament
at
this
age
was
regarded
as
synonymous
with
a
law
of
god
the
bible
and
the
english
government
were
upon
the
same
plane
each
to
be
implicitly
obeyed
canon
law
thus
firmly
established
by
act
of
parliament
the
union
of
church
and
state
complete
england
lost
much
of
that
civil
freedom
whose
origin
can
be
traced
to
the
wise
legislation
and
love
of
freedom
inhering
in
two
british
queens
martia
and
boadicea
suffering
from
cruel
wrong
the
latter
rose
in
revolt
against
the
romans
riding
among
the
squadrons
of
her
army
she
thus
addressed
them
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
britons
that
you
have
been
victorious
under
the
conduct
of
your
queen
i
come
not
here
as
one
of
royal
blood
to
fight
for
empire
or
riches
but
as
one
of
the
common
people
to
avenge
the
loss
of
their
liberty
the
wrongs
of
myself
and
my
children
if
you
britons
will
but
consider
the
motives
of
our
war
you
will
resolve
to
conquer
or
die
is
it
not
much
better
to
fall
in
the
defense
of
liberty
than
to
be
exposed
to
the
outrages
of
the
romans
such
at
least
is
my
resolution
you
may
if
you
please
live
and
be
slaves
but
many
historians
date
the
entire
subordination
of
the
common
law
to
ecclesiasticism
to
the
reign
of
stephen
who
ascended
to
the
throne
the
fourth
of
the
kings
in
order
to
keep
the
ranks
of
the
church
full
the
bearing
of
children
was
enforced
upon
women
as
a
religious
duty
no
condition
of
health
or
distaste
for
motherhood
was
admitted
as
exemption
alike
from
the
altar
the
confessional
and
at
the
marital
ceremony
was
this
duty
taught
nor
has
such
instruction
even
under
the
light
of
physiology
and
new
regard
for
personal
rights
yet
ceased
no
less
is
the
unresisting
subjection
of
women
in
this
relation
indirectly
or
directly
enforced
by
the
protestant
and
the
greek
churches
as
the
law
of
the
bible
and
god
increase
and
multiply
has
been
the
first
commandment
for
woman
held
as
far
more
binding
upon
her
than
the
ten
words
of
mount
sinai
proof
exists
in
abundance
of
a
character
impossible
to
present
in
this
work
under
the
general
absence
of
learning
and
the
equally
general
reverence
for
whatever
emanated
from
the
church
minor
ecclesiastics
found
it
in
their
power
to
promulgate
doctrines
to
suit
every
new
set
of
circumstances
thus
many
laws
aside
from
regularly
promulgated
canons
came
from
time
to
time
into
force
when
once
applied
they
assumed
all
the
power
of
custom
and
soon
bore
all
the
force
of
common
law
the
evils
of
ecclesiastical
law
were
soon
increased
through
the
unsparing
use
of
forgery
and
falsehood
lea
says
in
the
remodeling
of
european
institutions
so
necessary
to
the
interests
of
christianity
and
civilization
one
of
the
most
efficient
agencies
was
the
collection
of
canons
known
as
the
false
decretals
forgery
was
by
no
means
a
novel
expedient
to
the
church
from
the
earliest
times
orthodox
and
heretics
had
rivalled
each
other
in
the
manufacture
of
whatever
documents
were
necessary
to
substantiate
their
respective
positions
whether
in
faith
or
discipline
an
examination
of
these
decretals
tends
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
the
result
of
one
effort
or
the
work
of
one
man
their
constant
repetitions
and
their
frequent
contradiction
would
seem
to
prove
this
and
to
show
that
they
were
manufactured
from
time
to
time
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
or
to
gratify
the
feelings
of
the
writers
interpolated
into
codes
of
law
adopted
and
amplified
in
the
canons
of
councils
and
the
decretals
of
popes
they
speedily
became
part
of
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
policy
of
europe
leaving
traces
on
the
constitutions
which
they
afflicted
for
centuries
the
pretenses
and
privileges
which
they
conferred
on
the
hierarchy
became
the
most
dearly
prized
and
frequently
quoted
portions
of
the
canon
law
in
each
struggle
with
the
temporal
authority
it
was
the
arsenal
from
which
were
drawn
the
most
effective
weapons
and
after
each
struggle
the
sacerdotal
combatants
had
higher
vantage
ground
for
the
ensuing
conflict
theories
of
ecclesiastical
superiority
which
left
so
profound
an
impress
on
the
middle
ages
and
which
have
in
no
slight
degree
molded
our
modern
civilization
even
magna
charta
strengthened
canon
law
confirming
many
liberties
of
the
church
and
injuring
women
by
prohibiting
appeal
to
them
unless
for
the
death
of
their
husbands
while
the
general
tenor
of
the
church
was
against
marriage
an
unmarried
woman
unless
dedicating
her
life
to
the
church
was
regarded
with
more
contempt
than
the
married
to
be
under
control
of
a
husband
was
looked
upon
as
the
normal
condition
of
women
not
living
celibate
lives
consequently
women
were
driven
into
marriage
or
monastic
houses
and
no
reproach
so
great
as
the
term
old
the
influence
of
custom
is
nowhere
more
discernible
than
in
blackstone
himself
the
great
commentator
while
fully
admitting
the
blending
of
canon
with
common
law
also
acknowledging
its
most
prejudicial
effects
to
have
fallen
upon
woman
yet
attempts
to
prove
that
the
liberties
of
the
english
people
were
not
infringed
through
ecclesiasticism
he
is
so
entirely
permeated
with
the
church
doctrine
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
as
not
to
be
willing
to
acknowledge
the
infringement
of
her
natural
liberty
through
it
although
at
the
same
time
he
declares
that
whosoever
would
fully
understand
the
canon
law
must
study
common
law
in
respect
to
such
benumbing
of
the
moral
faculties
through
her
doctrines
is
among
the
greatest
wrongs
perpetrated
by
the
church
upon
mankind
nor
is
it
alone
in
regard
to
woman
during
the
war
a
writer
declared
the
great
and
absolute
need
of
the
french
people
to
be
education
that
of
moral
character
there
was
absolutely
none
either
in
the
higher
or
lower
classes
even
the
sons
of
aristocratic
families
educated
in
jesuit
schools
being
at
most
taught
that
wrong
can
only
be
measured
by
a
formal
religious
standard
and
that
every
wrong
can
be
wiped
out
by
confession
to
the
priest
french
education
this
writer
declared
to
be
that
of
two
centuries
ago
when
might
was
looked
upon
as
identical
with
justice
nor
can
morality
be
taught
while
its
basis
in
the
church
remains
the
same
the
priestly
profession
held
the
most
brilliant
promises
of
gratified
ambition
to
every
man
that
entered
it
not
alone
did
he
possess
the
keys
of
heaven
and
hell
but
also
those
of
temporal
power
the
laity
were
his
obedient
servants
upon
which
he
could
impose
penance
and
from
whose
coffers
wealth
could
be
made
to
flow
into
his
own
through
long
continued
false
teaching
the
people
believed
their
fate
in
both
worlds
more
fully
depended
upon
the
priesthood
than
upon
their
own
course
in
life
god
having
deputed
a
share
of
his
power
to
every
priest
and
monk
no
matter
how
debased
and
that
when
he
spoke
it
was
not
himself
but
god
through
his
lips
as
asserted
by
the
priesthood
themselves
this
impious
assertion
so
capable
as
shown
of
being
used
for
the
most
tyrannous
purposes
came
also
into
the
reformation
and
is
even
heard
from
the
lips
of
protestant
clergymen
today
denied
recognition
of
a
right
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
the
priest
spoke
from
god
or
from
his
own
ambitious
and
iniquitous
purposes
deprived
of
education
as
well
as
of
free
latter
a
crime
to
be
punished
with
death
after
the
most
diabolical
is
not
a
subject
of
surprise
that
the
majority
of
the
christian
world
was
a
prey
to
the
vilest
superstition
the
claim
of
infallibility
which
may
be
unsuccessfully
combated
when
urged
by
a
single
individual
became
when
advanced
by
a
large
powerfully
organized
and
widely
distributed
class
under
guise
of
religion
into
which
the
element
of
fear
largely
entered
no
salvation
outside
of
the
church
was
a
fundamental
doctrine
of
that
body
hell
was
declared
not
to
be
peopled
alone
by
the
heathen
but
by
christian
heretics
and
the
excommunicated
who
had
died
without
obtaining
forgiveness
from
the
church
these
were
depicted
as
in
eternal
torments
of
a
more
terrible
character
than
even
those
whom
birth
had
left
ignorant
of
the
plan
of
salvation
the
strength
of
the
church
lay
in
its
control
of
the
conscience
and
the
will
upon
the
state
it
fastened
double
bonds
first
by
its
control
of
each
individual
member

in
its
capacity
of
secular

long
before

falling
with
heaviest
weight
upon

as
blackstone
so
frankly
admits
from
the
x
to
the
xvi
centuries
is
the
period
when
the
features
of
the
canon
law
most
derogatory
to
woman
became
thoroughly
incorporated
into
english
common
law
since
which
period
the
complete
inferiority
and
subordination
of

has
been
as
fully
maintained
by
the

by

to

he
gave
a
copious
array
of
authors
in

german
latin
in
proof
that
the

of
those
two
countries
are
permanently
based
upon
ecclesiastical

an

thus
ordained
let
not
a

however
learned
or
holy
presume
to
teach
a

in
a
public
to
this
canon
may
be
ascribed
the
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
women
even
during
the
present
century
who
have
come
before
the
world
as
public
teachers
in
the
pulpit
at
the
bar
in
medicine
or
the
more
customary
branches
of
instruction
advancing
civilization
of
the
present
century
is
still
hampered
by
the
laws
of
an
imperfect
church
enacted
many
hundred
years
since
the
trial
of
mistress
anne
hutchinson
in
new
england
during
the
xvii
century
was
chiefly
for
the
sin
of
having
taught
men
all
modern
legislation
can
be
referred
to
the
church
for
its
origin
although
most
especially
noticeable
in
reference
to
women
legislated
for
as
a
class
distinct
and
separate
from
men
under
church
laws
the
humble
the
ignorant
the
helpless
have
been
the
most
oppressed
because
of
their
powerlessness
but
upon
no
part
of
humanity
has
this
oppression
so
heavily
fallen
as
upon
her
whom
the
church
has
declared
to
be
the
author
of
all
the
misery
of
human
life
the
laws
of
bastardy
and
illegitimacy
still
extant
in
christian
countries
which
decree
that
a
child
born
outside
of
marriage
shall
be
known
by
its
mother
s
name
and
she
alone
responsible
for
its
support
and
which
do
not
allow
it
to
inherit
its
putative
father
s
property
even
when
he
acknowledges
the
child
as
his
own
are
of
ecclesiastical
origin
enacted
by
the
church
in
its
most
powerful
days
as
protection
to
a
celibate
priesthood
against
all
claim
by
mother
or
child
they
are
still
a
reminder
of
the
matriarchate
when
the
sole
right
of
the
mother
to
the
child
was
unquestioned
but
under
church
ruling
this
law
that
the
child
should
follow
the
condition
of
the
mother
herself
but
a
slave
was
the
source
of
great
injustice
both
to
women
and
to
thousands
of
innocent
children
under
feudalism
and
during
slavery
the
child
of
the
feudal
lord
or
powerful
master
by
a
serf
woman
became
at
birth
subject
to
all
the
restrictions
of
the
mother
while
the
father
was
freed
from
accountability
of
any
nature
the
antonelli
case
referred
to
in
the
second
chapter
in
which
the
countess
lambertini
claimed
heirship
of
cardinal
antonelli
s
property
as
his
daughter
was
decided
against
her
not
upon
denial
of
her
paternity
which
was
most
fully
proven
but
because
under
church
law
this
daughter
had
no
claim
upon
her
priestly
father
under
canon
law
she
was
no
more
to
be
regarded
as
his
child
than
as
the
child
of
any
other
man
she
was
she
was
a
sacrilegious
child
having
violated
sacred
things
by
coming
into
existence
her
holy
father
under
canon
law
was
entirely
irresponsible
for
her
birth
the
reformation
proved
itself
in
many
ways
as
restrictive
towards
woman
as
catholicism
the
commencement
of
modern
law
dates
to
the
reign
of
elizabeth
who
established
the
reformation
upon
a
firm
basis
the
oppression
of
her
reign
exceeded
all
that
had
been
experienced
under
catholicism
no
cottager
in
england
was
permitted
to
shelter
his
homeless
mother
or
sister
under
penalty
because
she
was
the
greatest
amount
of
legislation
both
religious
and
secular
under
the
patriarchate
has
had
woman
for
its
object
and
this
is
especially
noticeable
in
all
countries
where
christianity
has
been
the
dominant
power
because
she
has
not
been
regarded
by
the
church
as
a
component
part
of
humanity
but
as
an
offshoot
whose
rights
and
responsibility
were
entirely
different
from
those
of
man
although
among
the
the
priesthood
possessed
great
influence
yet
after
the
norman
conquest
ecclesiasticism
gained
much
greater
control
in
england
and
canon
law
began
to
influence
legislation
as
has
been
shown
exercising
its
chief
restrictive
force
upon
woman
while
under
old
common
law
a
husband
was
compelled
to
leave
his
wife
of
his
property
and
could
leave
her
as
much
more
as
he
pleased
by
canon
law
he
was
prohibited
from
leaving
her
more
than
and
could
leave
her
as
much
less
as
he
pleased
thus
ecclesiasticism
presumed
to
control
a
husband
s
affections
and
placing
its
slimy
fingers
upon
common
law
allowed
the
husband
to
leave
his
wife
in
absolute
poverty
notwithstanding
that
her
property
upon
marriage
and
her
services
under
marriage
belonged
exclusively
to
him
as
early
as
the
twelfth
century
glanville
laid
it
down
as
a
law
of
the
british
kingdom
that
no
one
was
compelled
to
leave
another
person
any
portion
of
his
property
and
that
the
part
usually
devised
to
wives
was
left
them
at
the
dictate
of
affection
and
not
of
law
thus
early
did
the
church
in
england
override
common
law
to
the
detriment
of
woman
while
thus
legislating
in
opposition
to
family
rights
the
church
continually
favored
its
own
increase
of
its
own
property
the
world
has
produced
no
system
so
thoroughly
calculated
to
extend
its
own
power
and
wealth
as
this
vast
celibate
organization
which
under
the
guise
of
religion
appealed
to
man
s
superstition
and
ruled
his
will
under
the
assumption
of
divine
authority
the
family
being
its
chief
objective
point
of
attack
while
under
feudalism
his
lord
was
to
receive
the
best
gift
at
the
villein
s
death
the
church
the
second
best
in
time
the
demands
of
the
church
overpowered
those
of
the
lord
as
well
as
those
of
the
family
so
rapacious
did
the
church
at
last
become
in
its
demand
for
valuable
gifts
and
its
claim
of
one
third
of
a
man
s
property
upon
his
decease
that
the
civil
law
ultimately
interfered
not
however
in
the
interests
of
wives
but
of
creditors
canon
law
nearly
everywhere
prevailed
having
its
largest
growth
through
the
pious
fiction
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
wherever
it
became
the
basis
of
legislation
the
laws
of
succession
and
inheritance
and
those
in
regard
to
children
constantly
sacrificed
the
interests
of
wives
and
daughters
to
those
of
husbands
and
sons
church
legislation
created
numerous
and
stringent
enactments
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
woman
to
succeed
to
any
considerable
amount
of
property
forcing
her
to
entire
dependence
upon
man
either
as
a
wife
or
as
a
resident
of
a
religious
house
thus
she
entirely
lost
the
freedom
possessed
by
her
in
pagan
rome
while
under
canon
law
the
dower
of
the
wife
was
forfeited
by
attainder
of
the
husband
yet
the
husband
did
not
lose
his
right
to
the
wife
s
property
in
case
she
was
attainted
of
treason
under
canon
law
if
for
recognized
just
cause
of
the
husband
s
cruelty
the
wife
separated
from
him
she
was
returned
upon
his
demand
provided
he
gave
security
for
treating
her
well
canon
law
gave
to
the
husband
the
power
of
compelling
the
wife
s
return
if
for
any
cause
she
left
him
she
was
then
at
once
in
the
position
of
an
outlaw
branded
as
a
runaway
who
had
left
her
master
s
service
a
wife
who
had
left
bed
and
board
without
consent
and
whom
all
persons
were
forbidden
to
harbor
or
shelter
under
penalty
of
the
the
absconding
wife
was
in
the
position
of
an
excommunicate
from
the
catholic
church
or
of
a
woman
condemned
as
a
witch
any
person
befriending
her
was
held
accessory
to
the
wife
s
theft
of
herself
from
her
husband
and
rendered
liable
to
fine
and
other
punishment
for
having
helped
to
rob
the
husband
master
of
his
wife
slave
the
present
formula
of
advertising
a
wife
which
so
frequently
disgraces
the
press
is
due
to
this
belief
in
whereas
my
wife
has
left
my
bed
and
board
without
just
cause
or
provocation
i
hereby
forbid
all
persons
from
harboring
or
trusting
her
on
my
account
by
old
english
law
in
case
the
wife
was
in
danger
of
perishing
in
a
storm
it
was
allowable
to
harbor
and
shelter
her
it
is
less
than
fifty
years
since
the
dockets
of
a
court
in
new
york
city
the
great
metropolis
of
the
united
states
were
sullied
by
the
suit
of
a
husband
against
parties
who
had
received
harbored
and
sheltered
his
wife
after
she
left
him
the
husband
recovering
damages
in
losing
control
upon
marriage
of
her
person
and
her
property
woman
s
condition
became
that
of
an
infant
no
act
of
hers
was
of
legal
value
if
she
made
a
bargain
her
husband
could
repudiate
it
and
the
person
with
whom
she
had
contracted
was
held
to
have
taken
part
in
a
fraud
the
denial
under
common
law
of
her
right
to
make
a
contract
grew
out
of
the
denial
of
her
right
of
ownership
not
possessing
control
of
her
inheritance
or
of
her
future
actions
she
was
consequently
held
unable
to
make
a
binding
contract
forbidden
the
right
of
acting
for
herself
deprived
of
the
ownership
and
control
of
her
own
property
or
earnings
woman
had
little
opportunity
to
prove
her
business
capacity
since
the
time
of
aristotle
the
control
of
property
has
been
recognized
as
the
basis
of
social
and
responsible
conditions
the
great
school
of
german
jurists
teach
that
ownership
increases
both
physical
and
moral
capacity
and
that
as
owner
actual
or
possible
man
is
a
more
capable
and
worthy
being
than
he
would
otherwise
be
inasmuch
as
through
both
the
ecclesiastical
and
civil
laws
of
christendom
woman
was
debarred
from
giving
testimony
in
courts
of
law
sisters
prohibited
from
sharing
a
patrimony
with
brothers
wives
deprived
of
property
rights
both
of
inheritance
and
earnings
it
is
entirely
justifiable
to
say
that
even
the
boasted
common
law
that
pride
of
english
speaking
peoples
has
greatly
injured
civilization
through
its
destruction
of
woman
s
property
rights
canon
or
church
laws
were
enacted
upon
the
principle
of
protection
for
men
alone
and
upon
these
civil
laws
gradually
became
wholly
based
herbert
spencer
has
not
failed
to
recognize
this
fact
in
england
no
less
in
law
than
in
religion
is
woman
dealt
with
as
a
secondary
being
for
whom
equal
religious
rights
or
equal
civil
rights
are
not
designed
while
under
the
matriarchate
justice
and
purity
prevailed
and
the
inherent
rights
of
man
were
preserved
we
find
an
entirely
contrary
condition
under
the
patriarchate
that
system
enacting
laws
solely
with
intent
to
man
s
interest
regardless
alike
of
mother
sister
wife
or
daughter
the
entire
destruction
under
canon
and
civil
law
of
woman
s
property
rights
has
not
alone
lessened
her
responsibility
but
has
also
diminished
her
as
in
common
with
a
child
or
a
slave
her
business
agreements
were
held
as
of
no
binding
force
she
ultimately
came
to
regard
herself
as
incapable
of
business
transactions
in
england
until
a
very
recent
date
and
in
the
united
states
until
when
in
mississippi
first
placed
the
control
of
her
own
property
in
a
married
woman
s
hands
to
be
followed
in
by
pennsylvania
new
york
and
about
the
same
period
by
rhode
island
it
was
in
the
husband
s
power
in
every
part
of
christian
europe
and
america
to
repudiate
any
bargain
sale
or
gift
made
by
the
wife
as
of
no
binding
legal
force
and
this
even
though
she
had
brought
the
entire
property
into
the
marital
firm
therefore
under
christian
laws
the
person
with
whom
the
wife
made
a
contract
or
to
whom
she
made
a
gift
was
held
as
a
criminal
or
participant
in
a
fraud
the
wife
under
canon
law
belonged
to
the
husband
and
as
a
sequence
to
not
owning
herself
she
could
not
own
property
and
in
her
condition
of
servitude
could
possess
no
control
over
either
her
present
or
her
future
actions
such
is
common
law
warped
and
changed
by
canon
law
property
is
a
delicate
test
of
the
condition
of
a
nation
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
history
that
the
rights
of
property
have
everywhere
been
recognized
before
the
rights
of
person
the
american
revolution
arose
from
an
attack
upon
property
rights
and
although
the
declaration
of
independence
assumed
the
rights
of
person
to
be
primal
this
unique
foundation
for
a
system
of
government
has
not
yet
fully
been
admitted
in
practice
and
woman
is
still
denied
its
advantages
and
responsibilities
while
the
property
owner
unwittingly
becomes
a
hostage
for
the
security
of
the
state
itself
it
needs
governmental
recognition
of
the
rights
of
person
in
order
to
create
firm
and
a
feeling
of
strength
and
freedom
a
proper
can
not
inhere
in
any
person
under
governmental
control
of
others
unless
the
person
so
governed
constantly
maintains
a
system
of
rebellion
in
thought
or
deed
the
soul
gradually
becomes
debased
and
the
finest
principles
of
human
nature
suffer
a
rapid
process
of
disintegration
the
integrity
of
elementary
principles
disappears
bad
citizenship
results
the
general
rights
of
humanity
are
ignored
selfish
personal
or
family
interests
taking
their
place
good
citizenship
requires
individual
personal
responsibility
in
affairs
of
the
state
that
property
rather
than
person
still
receives
recognition
in
governmental
matters
owes
its
origin
to
the
period
when
the
rights
of
the
common
people
in
both
property
and
person
were
ignored
the
effort
of
the
peasant
was
chiefly
directed
to
securing
property
to
his
clouded
vision
the
wealth
of
the
lord
created
his
power
and
to
a
great
extent
such
was
the
fact
intuitively
he
felt
that
property
rights
were
the
basis
of
the
rights
of
persons
the
church
possessed
enormous
wealth
as
did
all
his
oppressors
and
the
peasant
could
but
see
that
control
of
rights
of
property
was
a
dangerous
assault
upon
their
rights
of
person
the
foremost
element
of
all
slavery
is
the
denial
to
the
slave
of
right
to
the
proceeds
of
his
own
labor
as
soon
as
a
colored
slave
in
the
united
states
was
permitted
to
hire
his
time
the
door
of
freedom
began
to
open
for
him
thus
when
canon
law
so
influenced
civil
and
common
law
that
it
forbade
woman
s
inheritance
and
ownership
of
property
it
placed
its
final
touch
upon
her
degradation
she
virtually
became
a
slave
to
her
husband
sir
henry
maine
is
outspoken
in
declaring
that
christianity
has
thus
deeply
injured
civilization
an
injury
from
which
he
asserts
there
can
be
no
recovery
as
long
as
society
remains
christian
as
a
man
of
profound
thought
he
does
not
fail
to
see
that
the
prevailing
religious
sentiment
created
by
the
teachings
of
the
church
as
to
woman
s
created
inferiority
and
subjection
to
man
was
the
cause
of
that
destruction
of
her
property
rights
the
priests
of
pagan
rome
held
juster
view
regarding
woman
than
did
the
christian
church
before
the
establishment
of
christianity
they
had
conferred
the
rights
of
woman
to
property
daughters
inherited
equally
with
sons
to
such
extent
was
woman
s
rights
of
property
carried
that
at
one
period
as
has
been
heretofore
stated
the
greater
part
of
the
of
the
empire
was
in
woman
s
possession
the
slavish
condition
of
woman
greatly
increased
through
denial
of
her
rights
of
inheritance
was
more
fully
established
through
denial
to
her
of
the
fruits
of
her
own
labor
in
the
marriage
relation
under
church
law
the
wife
was
the
husband
s
personal
slave
all
her
time
was
absolutely
his
civil
and
ecclesiastical
law
held
her
as
completely
under
his
authority
her
property
her
person
her
time
and
services
were
all
at
the
husband
s
disposal
nor
did
the
reformation
effect
a
change
in
this
respect
luther
s
ninety
theses
nailed
against
the
church
door
in
wittemberg
did
not
assert
woman
s
natural
or
religious
equality
with
man
it
was
a
maxim
of
his
that
no
gown
or
garment
worse
became
a
woman
than
that
she
will
be
the
home
under
the
reformation
was
governed
by
the
laws
in
force
before
that
period
first
she
was
to
be
under
obedience
to
the
masculine
head
of
the
household
second
she
was
to
be
constantly
employed
for
his
benefit
third
her
society
was
strictly
chosen
for
her
by
her
master
and
responsible
head
fourth
this
masculine
family
head
was
regarded
as
a
general
to
whom
she
was
held
as
responsible
in
word
and
deed
fifth
neither
genius
nor
talent
could
free
women
from
such
control
without
his
consent
the
cromwellian
period
while
exhibiting
an
increase
of
piety
brought
no
amelioration
to
woman
the
old
church
doctrine
of
her
having
caused
the
expulsion
of
men
from
paradise
was
still
proclaimed
from
the
pulpit
and
warnings
against
her
extreme
sinfulness
lost
none
of
their
invective
strength
from
the
lips
of
the
new
gospel
all
kinds
of
learning
and
accomplishments
for
her
fell
under
new
reprobation
and
the
old
teaching
as
to
her
iniquities
and
the
necessity
for
her
to
feel
shame
from
the
fact
of
her
existence
took
new
force
after
the
rise
of
melancthon
huss
and
luther
about
this
period
it
was
said
she
that
knoweth
how
to
compound
a
pudding
is
more
desirable
than
she
who
skilfully
compoundeth
a
men
thought
it
no
shame
to
devote
themselves
to
the
pleasure
of
the
table
epicures
and
gluttons
abounded
but
to
women
was
forbidden
a
seat
at
the
world
s
intellectual
board
she
who
secured
learning
did
so
at
the
peril
of
her
social
and
religious
position
under
no
other
system
of
religion
has
there
been
such
absolute
denial
of
woman
s
right
to
directly
approach
the
divinity
under
no
other
religious
system
has
her
debasement
been
greater
it
can
not
be
asserted
that
the
religious
system
teaching
restrictive
moral
and
civil
laws
regarding
woman
is
of
the
past
its
still
great
living
influence
is
shown
by
the
thousands
of
pilgrims
who
visited
italy
during
the
pope
s
jubilee
and
the
presents
of
incalculable
value
that
by
tens
of
thousands
poured
into
the
papal
treasury
in
commemoration
of
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
entrance
of
pope
leo
xiii
into
the
priesthood
these
were
received
from
almost
every
civilized
nation
christian
mohammedan
catholic
protestant
even
the
president
of
the
united
states
head
of
a
form
of
government
which
recognizes
religion
as
entirely
disconnected
with
the
state
so
far
catered
to
superstition
so
far
conceded
the
assumptions
of
this
system
as
to
send
an
elegant
copy
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
pope
through
cardinal
gibbons
no
stronger
proof
is
required
of
the
still
powerful
influence
of
that
system
based
upon
the
degradation
of
woman
than
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
temporary
head
of
a
nation
professedly
based
upon
a
recognition
of
equal
civil
political
and
religious
rights
the
queen
of
england
head
of
the
anglican
church
the
sultan
of
turkey
representative
of
mohammedanism
sadogara
the
celebrated
rabbi
of
vienna
known
as
the
pope
of
the
hebrews
were
all
found
among
the
number
of
persons
outside
of
catholicism
who
by
gifts
recognized
this
occasion
it
was
but
ten
years
previously
that
pope
pius
ix
celebrated
his
jubilee
entrance
into
the
episcopal
office
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
but
the
jubilee
of
leo
xiii
exceeded
in
splendor
and
popular
interest
anything
of
the
kind
ever
before
known
as
the
history
of
the
church
with
a
religious
clientele
of
behind
him
and
the
ten
thousand
magnificent
testimonials
as
to
the
justice
of
his
claim
as
vicar
of
jesus
christ
the
world
can
not
fail
to
be
impressed
by
the
danger
to
human
liberty
still
connected
with
this
powerful
organization
an
organization
that
in
its
control
of
human
thought
and
human
will
has
ever
been
of
incalculable
injury
to
mankind
portions
of
the
daily
press
saw
the
continuing
danger
declaring
that
these
facts
are
truly
impressive
indicating
as
they
do
the
tremendous
hold
which
the
roman
ecclesiastical
system
has
gained
over
the
hearts
and
minds
of
men
very
striking
too
is
the
contrast
between
all
this
magnificence
and
pomp
and
manifest
aspiration
for
temporal
power
on
the
part
of
one
who
claims
to
be
the
representative
on
earth
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
and
the
poverty
unostentation
and
of
the
son
of
man
who
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
this
jubilee
is
an
event
of
great
moment
to
the
xix
century
at
once
a
warning
and
a
proof
of
the
life
and
strength
of
that
scheme
which
has
for
its
real
end
not
alone
the
spiritual
but
also
the
temporal
subjugation
of
the
entire
human
race
since
italy
under
king
humbert
secured
its
release
from
the
temporal
power
thus
severing
the
last
authoritative
grasp
of
the
pope
upon
temporal
kingdoms
the
attempt
has
been
sedulously
made
to
create
a
fictitious
sympathy
for
the
pope
under
claim
of
his
imprisonment
in
the
vatican
nor
at
the
least
supreme
moment
of
his
pride
and
glorification
did
the
pope
forget
to
call
attention
of
the
world

we
can
trace
those

which
for
many
centuries
filled
the
church
with
shame
for
practices
more
obscene
than
the
orgies

to

rev
charles
kingsley
a
canon
of
the
english
church
declared
that
from
the
third
to
the
fifteenth
centuries
christianity
had
been
swamped
by
hysteria
in
the
practice
of
all
those
nameless
orgies
which
made
a
of
corinth
during
the
first
century
every
evil
was
traced
to
woman
a
curious
old
black
letter
volume
published
in
london
declares
that
the
reason
why
women
have
no
control
in
parliament
why
they
make
no
laws
consent
to
none
abrogate
none
is
their
original
the
minds
of
people
having
been
corrupted
through
centuries
by
the
doctrines
of
the
church
in
regard
to
woman
it
became
an
easy
step
for
the
state
to
aid
in
her
degradation
the
system
of
feudalism
arising
from
the
theory
that
warfare
was
the
normal
condition
of
man
still
oppressed
woman
by
bringing
into
power
a
class
of
men
accustomed
to
deeds
of
violence
who
found
their
chief
pleasure
in
the
sufferings
of
others
to
be
a
woman
appealed
to
no
instinct
of
tenderness
in
this
class
to
be
a
woman
was
not
to
be
protected
unless
such
woman
held
power
in
her
own
right
or
acted
in
place
of
some
feudal
lord
the
whole
body
of
villeins
and
serfs
were
under
absolute
dominion
of
the
feudal
lords
they
were
regarded
as
possessing
no
rights
of
their
own
the
priests
had
control
of
their
souls
the
lord
of
their
bodies
but
it
was
not
upon
the
male
serfs
that
the
greatest
oppression
fell
although
the
tillage
of
the
soil
the
care
of
swine
and
cattle
was
theirs
the
masters
claiming
half
or
more
of
everything
even
to
of
the
wool
shorn
from
the
flock
and
all
exactions
upon
them
were
great
while
their
sense
of
security
was
slight
it
was
upon
their
wives
and
daughters
that
the
greatest
outrages
were
inflicted
it
was
a
pastime
of
the
castle
retainers
to
fall
upon
peaceful
villages
to
the
consternation
of
the
women
who
were
struck
tortured
and
made
the
sport
of
ribald
soldiers
serfs
of
the
body
they
had
no
protection
the
vilest
outrages
were
perpetrated
by
the
feudal
lords
under
the
name
of
women

taught
by
church
and
state
alike
that
the
feudal
lord
or
seigneur
had
a
right
to
them
not
only
as
against
themselves
but
as
against
any
claim
of
husband
or
father
the
custom
known
by
a
variety
of
names
but
more
modernly
as
marchetta
or
marquette
compelled
newly
married
women
to
a
most
dishonorable
servitude
they
were
regarded
as
the
rightful
prey
of
the
feudal
lord
for
from
one
to
three
days
after
their
marriage
and
from
this
custom
the
oldest
son
of
the
serf
was
held
as
the
son
of
the
lord
as
perchance
it
was
he
who
begot
from
this
nefarious
degradation

the

his

fully
as
he
did

claim
to
half
the

of

or
half
the

more
than
one
reign
of
terror
arose
in
france
from
the
enforcement
of
this
law
and
the
uprisings
of
the
peasants
over
europe
during
the
twelfth
century
and
the
fierce
jacquerie
or
peasants
war
of
the
fourteenth

in

their
origin
among
other
causes

unprotected

bitter
enemies

even
in

orders
did
not
lessen
their
claims
upon
the
bride
most
of
the
bishops
and
were
also
temporal

the
bishop
of
amiens
possessed
this
right
against
the
women
of
his
vassals
and
the
peasants
of
his

of
which
he
was
dispossessed
at

younger

were
thus
easily
provided
for

the
corruptions
of
the

yet
having
connected
themselves
with

they
did
not

in

fourteenth
century
at

lyons
was
reunited
to

it
was
but
slowly
after
a
great
number
of
complaints
and
arrests
of
judgment
that
the
canons
of
lyons
consented
to
forego
this
custom
in
several
cantons
of

curés
imitated

bishops
and
anciently
took

right
of

but
ultimately
the
peasants
of

refused
to

and
the
priests
gave
up

also
added
to
the

the
strangest
sermons
in

duty
in
this
respect
fell
from
the
lips
of
celibate
monks
and
priests
she
was
taught
that
sensual
submission
to

and
the
bearing
of
children
were
the

the
enforcement

these
duties

great
wrongs

concessions
gained
were

merely

marquette
began
to
be
abolished
in
france
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century

an
authority
upon
this
question
says
that
without

usage
still
continued
in

countries
farther
asserting
that
even
in
this
century
it
existed
in
the
county
of
auvergne
and
several
vassals
plead
to
their
lords
against
the
continuance
of
this
custom
because
of
the
great
unhappiness
it
caused
them
the
lower
orders
of
the
clergy
were
very
unwilling
to
relinquish
this
usage
vigorously
protesting
to
their
archbishops
against
the
deprivation
of
the
right
declaring
they
could
not

boems

that
he
was

at
a
spiritual
council
of
the
metropolitane
of
bourges
and
heard
a
priest
claim
the
right
upon
ground
of
immemorial
usage
although
feudalism
is
generally
considered
the
parent
of
this
most
infamous
custom
some
writers
attribute
its
origin
to
an
evangelical
council
or
to
precepts
directly
inculcated
by
the
church
whose
very
highest
dignitaries
did
not
hesitate
to
avail
themselves
of
the
usage
in
quite
the

part
of

fifteenth
century
pope

fount
of

woman
herself
was
powerless
the

the
state
the

all
possessed
authority
over
her
as
against

although
eventually
redemption
through
the

of

was
possible

too
poor
or
penurious
to
save
her

this
debasement
of
his

this
inexpressible
abuse
and
degradation
of

under
the
name
of

with

few
except
manorial
courts

even
when
freedom
had
been
purchased
for

bride
all
feudal
customs
rendered
it
imperative
upon
her
to
bear
the
wedding
dish
to
the
castle
accompanied
by
her
husband
this
ceremony
ever
drew
upon
the
newly
married
couple
a
profusion
of
jeers
and
ribald
jests
from
which
they
were
powerless
to
protect
themselves

immunity

the
claim
of
the
lord
to
the
peasant
wife
was
not
always
confined
to
the
marriage
day
and
refusal
of
the
loan
of
his
wife
at
later
date
brought
most
severe
punishment
upon
the
husband
blessing
the
nuptial
bed
by
the
priest
often
late
at
night
was
also
common
and
accompanied
by
many
abuses
until
advancing
civilization
overpowered
the
darkness
of
the
church
and
brought
it
to
an
end
when
too
poor
to
purchase
the
freedom
of
his
bride
the
husband
was
in
one
breath
assailed
by
the
most
opprobrious
names
and
in
the
next
he
was
congratulated
upon
the
honor
to
be
done
him
in
that
perchance
his
oldest
child
would
be
the
son
of
a
baron
so
great
finally
became
the
reproach
and
infamy
connected
with
the
de
as
this
right
was
generally
called
in
france
and
so
recalcitrant
became
the
peasants
over
its
nefarious
exactions
that
ultimately
both
lords
spiritual
and
lords
temporal
fearing
for
their
own
safety
commenced
to
lessen
their
demands
this
custom
had
its
origin
at
the
time
the
great
body
of
the
people
were
slaves
bound
either
to
the
person
or
land
of
some
lord
at
this
period
personal
rights
no
more
existed
for
the
lower
classes
than
for
the

of

country
during
the
time
of
slavery
under
feudalism
the
property
family
ties
and
even
the
lives
of

serfs
were
under
control
of

it
was
a
system
of
slavery
without

superior

age

greater
rarity
these

apart

in
readiness
for
the
grossest
amusement
at
an
age
when
human
life
was
valueless
and
suffering
of
every
kind
was
disregarded
we
can
readily
surmise
the
fate
likely
to
overtake
unprotected
peasant

they
were
constantly
ridiculed
and
insulted

common
and

all

than

a
belief
that

the
prevailing
conviction
among

this
is
both
a

blood
of
the
nobility
of
that
country
runs
in
the
veins
of
its
most
degraded
and
ignorant
population
although
italy
the
seat
of
the
papal
power
is
noted
for
the
ignorance
squalor
and
superstition
of
its
people
we
no
less
find
such
a
condition
of
affairs
existing
in
russia
amid
the
starvation
of
its
people
accompanied
by
that
form
of
disease
which
in
the
irish
famine
of
was
known
as
the
peasants
will
not
accept
aid
from
count
tolstoi
whom
they
have
been
taught
to
regard
as
fearing
that
by
so
doing
they
will
condemn
themselves
to
eternal
torment
while
the
peasantry
are
thus
suffering
wrongs
of
every
nature
the
priesthood
and
churches
are
as
thriving
as
before
having
shown
the
results
of
power
in
the
hands
of
a
controlling
class
upon
women
of
low
degree
in
both
the
catholic
and
greek
divisions
of
christendom
we
have
but
to
look
at
our
own
country
to
find
like
condition
under
protestantism
the
state
of
the
slave
women
of
the
south
was
that
of
serfs
of
the
body
under
feudalism
or
of
the
serf
peasant
women
of
russia
nor
is
other
proof
of
this
statement
required
than
the
hue
of
this
race
no
longer
spoken
of
as
the
blacks
but
as
colored
people
let
the
condition
of
woman
as
to
her
rights
of
person
under
the
three
great
divisions
of
christianity
be
answer
to
all
who
without
examination
of
history
or
the
customs
of
ancient
and
modern
times
and
with
eyes
closed
to
these
most
patent
facts
so
falsely
assert
that
woman
has
been
elevated
by
christianity
and
is
now
holding
a
position
never
before
in
the
world
accorded
her
but
what
has
already
been
shown
of
her
degradation
under
christian
teachings
and
laws
is
but
a
small
portion
of
the
wrongs
woman
has
suffered
during
the
christian
centuries
under
theory
of
the
divine
rights
of
man
society
has
everywhere
been
permeated
with
disregard
for
woman
s
rights
of
person
monarchs
not
posing
as
spiritual
heads
of
their
people
have
yet
equally
made
use
of
their
place
and
power
for
woman
s
degradation
and
an
indefinite
fatherhood
outside
of
marriage
augustus
of
saxony
king
of
poland
is
chiefly
renowned
in
history
as
the
father
of
three
hundred
illegitimate
children
of
charles
ii
not
alone
king
of
england
but
also
head
of
the
anglican
church
one
of
his
subjects
declared
him
to
be
the
father
of
many
of
his
people
in
the
literal
as
well
as
in
the
spiritual
sense
four
english
dukes
of
the
present
day
trace
their
lineage
to
this
monarch
who
left
no
legitimate
descendants
the
present
to
the
english
throne
bears
an
equally
unsavory
record
to
him
and
his
aristocratic
companions
in
guilt
is
due
the
support
and
protection
of
england
s
notorious
and
infamous
purchase
and
sale
outrage
and
exploitation
of
helpless
young
girls
an
english
clergyman
writing
the

at
the
time
of

disclosures
made
by

declared
he
had
in
his
possession
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
royal
princes

nobles
and
leading
men
who
had
been
the
principal
patrons
and
supporters
of
the
gilded
hells
devoted
to
the
ruin
of
the
merest
children
girls
from
the
ages
of
nine
to
thirteen
the
reputation
of
the
male
members
of
the
hanoverian
dynasty
has
ever
been
bad
trace
as
you
will
the
path
of
either
ecclesiastical
or
temporal
rulers
claiming
authority
by
divine
right
and
you
will
find
the
way
marked
with
the
remains
of
women
and
children
whose
life
has
been
wrecked
by
man
under
plea
of
created
superiority
while
italy
within
the
last
forty
years
has
escaped
from
the
temporal
control
of
the
pope
its
kings
have
no
less
copied
the
immorality
of
the
vicar
of
god
the
predecessor
of
the
late
king
of
italy
having
left
illegitimate
children
an
instance
of
the
survival
of
the
feudal
idea
as
to
the
right
of
the
lord
to
the
person
of
his
vassal
women
occurred
in
ireland
within
the
past
few
years
graphically
described
in
a
letter
upon
landlords
from
locke
nasby
december
in
which
he
says
one
was
shot
a
few
years
ago
and
a
great
ado
was
made
about
it
in
this
case
as
in
most
of
the
others
it
was
not
a
question
of
rent
my
lord
had
visited
his
estates
to
see
how
much
more
money
could
be
taken
out
of
his
tenants
and
his
lecherous
eye
happened
to
rest
upon
a
very
beautiful
girl
the
eldest
daughter
of
a
widow
with
seven
children
now
this
beautiful
girl
was
betrothed
to
a
nice
sort
of
a
boy
who
having
been
in
america
knew
a
thing
or
two
my
lord
through
his
agent
who
is
always
a
pimp
as
well
as
a
brigand
ordered
kitty
to
come
to
the
castle
kitty
knowing
very
well
what
that
meant
refused
very
well
says
the
agent
yer
mother
is
in
arrears
for
rent
and
you
had
better
see
my
lord
or
i
shall
be
compelled
to
evict
kitty
knew
what
that
meant
also
it
meant
that
her
gray
haired
mother
her
six
helpless
brothers
and
sisters
would
be
pitched
out
by
the
roadside
to
die
of
starvation
and
exposure
and
so
kitty
without
saying
a
word
to
her
mother
or
any
one
else
went
to
the
castle
and
was
kept
there
three
days
till
my
lord
was
tired
of
her
when
she
was
permitted
to
go
she
went
to
her
lover
like
an
honest
girl
as
she
was
and
told
him
she
would
not
marry
him
but
refused
to
give
any
reason
finally
the
truth
was
wrenched
out
of
her
and
mike
went
and
found
a
shot
gun
that
had
escaped
the
eye
of
the
royal
constabulary
and
he
got
powder
and
shot
and
old
nails
and
he
lay
behind
a
hedge
under
a
tree
for
several
days
finally
one
day
my
lord
came
riding
by
all
so
gay
and
that
gun
went
off
and
subsequent
proceedings
interested
him
no
there
was
a
hole
a
blessed
hole
clear
through
him
and
he
never
was
so
good
a
man
as
before
because
there
was
less
of
him
then
mike
went
and
told
kitty
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
not
be
cast
down
that
the
little
difference
between
him
and
my
lord
had
been
happily
settled
and
that
they
would
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
and
they
were
married
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
taking
in
my
hand
the
very
hand
that
fired
the
blessed
shot
and
of
seeing
the
wife
to
avenge
whose
cruel
wrongs
the
shot
was
fired
nor
is
this
the
only
instance
in
modern
ireland
a
certain
lord
leitram
was
noted
a
few
years
since
for
his
attempts
to
dishonor
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
peasantry
upon
his
vast
estate
comprising
acres
his
character
was
that
of
the
worst
feudal
barons
and
like
those
he
used
his
power
as
magistrate
and
noble
in
addition
to
that
of
landlord
to
accomplish
his
purpose
after
an
assault
upon
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
girl
by
a
brutal
retainer
of
his
lordship
her
character
assailed
his
tenantry
finally
declared
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
last
means
in
their
power
to
preserve
the
honor
of
their
wives
and
daughters
six
men
were
chosen
as
the
instruments
of
their
rude
justice
and
among
them
the
brother
of
this
girl
upon
whom
the
leadership
fell
they
took
oath
to
be
true
to
the
end
in
life
or
death
raised
a
sum
of
money
purchased
arms
and
seeking
a
convenient
opportunity
shot
him
to
death
nor
were
the
perpetrators
ever
discovered
yet
it
is
now
known
that
two
of
them
died
in
australia
two
in
the
boer
war
in
south
africa
and
the
leader
who
came
to
the
united
states
changing
his
name
passed
away
in
the
summer
of
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
under
head
of
a
story
of
another
tale
is
related
of
woman
s
oppression
in
ireland
aided
by
the
petty
sessions
bench
in
recently
a
young
girl
named
catherine
cafferby
of
belmullet
in
county
pink
of
her
father
s
from
the
domestic
service
of
a
landlord
as
absolute
as
lord
leitrim
the
moment
the
poor
creature
discovered
what
that
service
customarily
involved
the
great
man
had
the
audacity
to
invoke
the
law
to
compel
her
to
return
as
she
had
not
given
statutable
notice
of
her
flight
she
clung
to
the
of
her
father
s
cabin
she
told
aloud
the
story
of
her
terror
and
called
on
god
and
man
to
save
her
her
tears
her
shrieks
her
piteous
pleadings
were
all
in
vain
the
petty
sessions
bench
ordered
her
back
to
the
landlord
s
service
or
else
to
pay
five
pounds
or
two
weeks
in
jail
this
is
not
a
story
of
bulgaria
under
murad
iv
but
of
ireland
in
the
reign
of
the
present
sovereign
that
peasant
girl
went
to
jail
to
save
her
chastity
if
she
did
not
spend
a
fortnight
in
the
cells
it
was
only
because
friends
of
outraged
virtue
justice
and
humanity
paid
the
fine
when
the
story
reached
the
outer
world
these
iniquities
have
taken
place
in
christian
lands
and
these
nefarious
outrages
upon
women
have
been
enforced
by
the
christian
laws
of
both
church
and
state
the
degradation
and
unhappiness
of
the
husband
at
the
infringement
of
the
lord
s
spiritual
and
temporal
upon
his
marital
rights
has
been
depicted
by
many
writers
but
history
has
been
quite
silent
upon
the
despair
and
shame
of
the
wife
no
hope
appeared
for
woman
anywhere
the
church
which
should
have
been
the
great
conserver
of
morals
dragged
her
to
the
lowest
depths
through
the
vileness
of
its
teachings
and
its
priestly
customs
the
state
which
should
have
defended
her
civil
rights
followed
the
example
of
the
church
in
crushing
her
to
the
earth
christian
laws
were
detrimental
to
woman
in
every
relation
of
life
the
brilliant
french
author
legouve
gives
from
among
the
popular
songs
of
brittany
during
the
fourteenth
century
a
pathetic
ballad
the
baron
of
jauioz
which
vividly
depicts
the
condition
of
the
peasant
women
of
france
at
that
date
in
the
power
of
the
male
members
of
her
family
over
her
we
also
find
an
exact
parallel
in
the
condition
of
english
women
of
the
same
era
the
moral
disease
thus
represented
being
due
to
the
same
religious
teaching
the
change
of
country
and
language
but
more
fully
serves
to
depict
the
condition
of
woman
everywhere
in
christendom
at
this
period

your

lies
on
her
this
ballad
founded
upon
historic
facts
represents
the
social
life
of
christendom
during
the
fourteenth
century
the
authority
of
the
son
the
licentiousness
of
the
lord
the
powerlessness
of
the
mother
the
despair
of
the
daughter
the
indifference
of
society
are
vividly
depicted
in
this
pathetic
ballad
it
shows
the
young
girl
regarded
as
a
piece
of
merchandise
to
be
bought
and
sold
at
the
whim
of
her
masters
who
are
the
men
of
her
own
household
and
the
lord
of
the
manor
during
the
feudal
period
the
power
of
the
son
was
nearly
absolute
for
his
own
aggrandisement
he
did
not
hesitate
to
rob
his
sisters
or
sell
them
into
lechery
hopelessly
despairing
in
tone
this
ballad
gives
us
a
clear
picture
of
feudal
times
when
chivalry
was
at
its
height
and
the
church
had
reached
its
ultimate
of
power
woman
s
attitude
today
is
the
echo
of
that
despair
at
this
period
the
condition
of
a
woman
was
not
even
tolerable
unless
she
was
an
heiress
with
fiefs
in
possession
even
then
she
was
deprived
of
her
property
in
case
of
loss
of
chastity
of
which
it
was
the
constant
aim
to
deprive
her
guardians
next
of
kin
and
if
none
such
existed
the
church
threw
constant
temptations
in
her
way
ruffians
were
hired
or
reckless
profligates
induced
to
betray
her
under
plea
of
love
and
sympathy
well
paid
by
the
next
heir
for
their
treachery
although
sir
william
blackstone
in
his
commentaries
said
that
he
discovered
no
traces
of
marquette
in
england
a
reminiscence
of
that
custom
is
to
be
found
in
the
fine
or
permit
known
in
that
country
as
redemption
of
blood
and
designated
as
by
fleta
this
was
a
customary
payment
made
by
a
tenant
to
his
lord
for
license
to
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
such
redemption
was
considered
a
special
mark
of
tenure
in
villeinage
it
was
not
exacted
from
a
free
man
which
is
corroborative
proof
of
its
origin
in
the
primae
of
the
feudal
lord
of
the
free
man
this
fine
was
not
permissible
because
of
the
privilege
of
free
blood
raepsaet
hoffman
karl
schmidt
and
other
authors
writing
in
the
interest
of
the
church
and
finding
it
impossible
to
deny
the
existence
of
some
power
over
the
bride
have
questioned
its
character
declaring
it
not
to
be
feudal
but
a
spiritual
authority
to
guard
the
bride
by
enforcing
a
penitence
of
marital
abstinence
of
one
to
three
days
after
the
nuptials
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
under
the
peculiar
teachings
of
the
church
in
regard
to
the
uncleanliness
of
marriage
such
continence
was
a
certain
period
part
of
church
law
nevertheless
this
does
not
invalidate
the
fact
that
a
widespread
contrary
custom
existed
in
feudal
times
and
at
a
still
later
period
the
present
usages
of
society
point
back
to
an
age
when
right
to
the
peasant
s
bride
was
enforced
by
the
lord
a
reminiscence
of
this
period
is
to
be
found
in
charivari
and
the
buying
off
of
a
party
of
this
character
with
refreshments
from
the
house
or
with
money
for
the
purchase
of
cigars
and
liquor
such
occurrences
constantly
fall
within
our
knowledge
personally
or
through
the
press
the
very
fact
of
such
persecution
of
the
bridal
pair
is
a
symbol
of
that
custom
under
which
the
retainers
of
the
feudal
lord
jeered
and
flouted
the
bridegroom
throwing
him
into
foul
water
and
other
most
unseemly
practices
to
others
outside
of
the
charivari
party
this
practice
still
affords
amusement
few
persons
inclining
to
interfere
or
prohibit
such
pastimes
society
no
longer
as
sharply
defined
as
in
the
feudal
period
yet
has
preserved
in
this
practice
a
symbol
of
the
times
when
even
the
highborn
dames
in
the
castle
equally
as
degraded
as
its
lord
amused
themselves
while
the
bride
was
in
the
company
of
the
lord
by
ridiculing
and
torturing
the
husband
who
in
anxiety
for
his
wife
ventured
too
near
the
castle
the
present
nearly
universal
custom
of
a
wedding
journey
must
be
referred
in
its
origin
to
the
same
period
arising
from
an
inherited
tendency
in
the
bride
and
groom
to
escape
the
jeers
and
ill
treatment
that
in
past
ages
invariably
accompanied
entrance
into
the
married
state
in
some
european
countries
redemption
was
demanded
from
all
women
not
alone
the
daughters
of
villeins
and
serfs
but
also
of
those
of
noble
birth
who
were
freed
by
payment
of
a
ransom
in
silver
known
as
the
maiden
lands
were
even
held
under
maiden
redemption
in
scotland
this
ransom
became
known
as
marquette
margaret
wife
of
malcolm
canmore
generally
spoken
of
for
her
goodness
as
saint
margaret
exercising
her
royal
influence
in
against
this
degradation
of
her
sex
numberless
seditions
having
arisen
from
this
claim
upon
the
bride
the
king
more
willingly
established
a
release
upon
the
payment
of
a
piece
of
silver
a
called
marquette
whence
the
name
and
a
certain
number
of
cows
the
piece
of
silver
went
to
the
king
the
cows
to
the
queen
and
from
that
period
cuissage
was
known
as
the
droit
de
marquette
but
this
nefarious
custom
possessed
such
strength
appealing
directly
to
man
s
basest
passions
his
love
of
power
his
human
beast
within
it
continued
in
existence
nearly
seven
hundred
years
after
the
royal
edict
in
scotland
against
its
practice
this
vile
power
extended
over
all
ranks
of
women
the
king
holding
it
over
the
daughters
of
the
grand
seigneur
the
suzerain
over
the
daughters
of
his
vassals
the
seigneur
over
the
daughters
of
his
serfs
even
the
judge
or
bailie
enforcing
this
right
upon
all
women
who
passed
upon
his
road
the
church
has
ever
been
the
bulwark
of
this
base
claim
holding
the
powers
of
penance
and
of
excommunication
such
custom
could
neither
have
originated
nor
been
sustained
without
the
sanction
of
the
church
at
this
date
the
privileges
of
the
lower
clergy
were
extraordinary
even
in
england
they
were
not
amenable
to
the
common
law
they
ruled
the
laity
with
iron
hand
but
the
laity
possessed
no
power
over
the
priesthood
all
appointments
were
in
priestly
hands
the
union
of
church
and
state
complete
god
himself
seemed
to
have
forsaken
woman
and
the
peasantry
lost
all
belief
in
the
justice
of
earth
or
heaven
the
customs
of
feudalism
which
were
akin
to
the
customs
of
power
wherever
existing
throughout
christendom
did
more
to
create
what
the
church
terms
infidelity
than
all
the
reason
of
the
philosophers
no
human
being
is
so
degraded
as
not
to
possess
an
innate
sense
of
justice
a
wrong
is
as
keenly
felt
by
the
most
humble
and
ignorant
as
by
the
educated
and
refined
its
effect
more
lasting
because
of
the
impossibility
of
redress
the
power
of
the
seigneur
was
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
king
himself
manorial
courts
entirely
local
aided
the
seigneur
in
the
enforcement
of
his
traditional
privileges
at
the
expense
of
the
villeins
the
crown
possessed
no
jurisdiction
over
these
courts
the
lord
held
the
right
to
make
laws
render
justice
lay
imposts
declare
war
coin
money
dispose
of
the
goods
and
lives
of
his
subjects
and
other
prerogatives
still
more
closely
touching
their
personal
rights
especially
of
the
women
living
in
his
dominion
to
persons
not
conversant
with
the
history
of
feudalism
and
the
church
it
will
seem
impossible
that
such
foulness
could
ever
have
been
part
of
christian
civilization
that
the
vices
they
have
been
taught
to
consider
the
outgrowth
of
paganism
and
as
the
worst
heathendom
could
have
existed
in
christian
europe
upheld
many
hundred
years
by
both
church
and
state
will
strike
most
people
with
incredulity
such
however
is
the
truth
we
are
compelled
to
admit
well
attested
facts
of
history
however
severe
a
blow
they
strike
our
preconceived
beliefs
the
seigneural
tenure
of
the
feudal
period
was
a
law
of
christian
europe
more
dishonorable
than
the
worship
of
astarte
at
babylon
in
order
to
fully
comprehend
the
vileness
of
marquette
we
must
remember
that
it
did
not
originate
in
a
pagan
country
many
thousand
years
since
that
it
was
not
a
heathen
custom
transplanted
to
europe
with
many
others
adopted
by
the
church
but
that
it
arose
in
christian
countries
a
thousand
years
after
the
origin
of
that
religion
continuing
in
existence
until
within
the
last
century
the
attempt
made
by
some
modern
authors
to
deny
that
the
claim
of
the
feudal
lord
to
the
person
of
his
female
serf
upon
her
marriage
ever
existed
on
the
ground
that
statutes
sustaining
such
a
right
have
not
been
discovered
is
extremely
weak
the
authority
of
a
custom
or
unwritten
law
is
still
almost
absolute
a
second
objection
that
such
customs
are
unchristian
has
been
answered
the
third
plea
in
opposition
namely
that
those
so
outraged
so
oppressed
left
no
record
of
resistance
is
false
aside
from
the
fact
that
education
was
everywhere
limited
no
peasant
and
but
few
of
the
nobility
knowing
how
to
read
or
write
and
within
the
church
learning
very
rare
we
have
indisputable
evidence
of
strong
character
in
the
revolt
of
serfs
at
different
periods
through
which
concessions
were
gained
the
final
refusal
of
the
serfs
to
marry
and
in
the
travesty
upon
religion
known
as
the
black
we
can
not
measure
the
serf
s
power
of
resistance
by
the
same
standard
as
our
own
the
degradation
of
man
with
but
a
few
exceptions
was
as
great
as
that
of
woman
civilly
and
educationally
the
peasant
man
was
on
a
par
with
the
peasant
woman
no
more
than
she
had
he
a
voice
in
making
the
laws
the
serf
was
virtually
a
slave
under
the
absolute
dominion
of
his
lord
no
power
existed
for
him
higher
than
that
of
his
feudal
superior
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
realize
the
hopeless
degraded
condition
of
the
peasant
serf
of
the
middle
ages
it
has
had
no
parallel
in
the
present
century
except
in
the
slavery
of
the
southern
states
free
action
free
speech
free
thought
was
impossible
but
our
respect
for
humanity
is
increased
when
we
know
that
these
vassals
although
under
the
life
and
death
power
of
their
lords
did
not
tamely
submit
to
the
indignities
enforced
upon
their
wives
and
daughters
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
the
historians
of
that
period
were
generally
priests
by
whom
the
fact
of
such
usage
or
custom
would
pass
unmentioned
especially
as
the
church
taught
that
woman
was
created
to
meet
the
special
demands
of
man
other
important
historical
facts
have
been
as
lightly
touched
upon
or
passed
over
entirely
the
deification
of
julius
caesar
while
emperor
of
rome
is
scarcely
referred
to
in
the
more
familiar
literary
sources
of
roman
history
and
yet
his
worship
was
almost
universal
in
the
provinces
where
he
was
adored
as
a
god
the
records
of
this
worship
are
only
to
be
found
in
scattered
monuments
and
inscriptions
but
recently
brought
to
light
and
deciphered
within
the
last
few
years
through
these
it
is
proven
that
there
was
an
organized
worship
of
this
emperor
and
an
order
of
consecrated
priests
devoted
to
him
higgins
refers
to
this
deification
of
caesar
it
is
not
alone
proof
of
the
low
condition
of
morality
at
this
period
but
also
of
the
universal
disbelief
in
woman
s
authority
over
or
right
to
herself
that
so
few
writers
upon
feudal
subjects
have
treated
of
the
libidinous
powers
of
the
lord
over
his
female
serfs
even
those
presenting
the
evils
of
feudalism
in
other
respects
have
merely
expressed
a
mild
surprise
that
christian
people
should
have
admitted
that
right
of
the
lord
over
his
feminine
vassals
the
various
names
under
which
this
right
was
known
as
jus
primae
noctis
droit
de
seigneur
droit
de
jambage
droit
de
cuissage
droit
d
afforage
droit
de
marquette
and
many
other
terms
too
indelicate
for
repetition
indicating
this
right
of
the
lord
over
all
the
women
in
his
domain
is
still
another
incontestable
proof
of
the
universality
of
the
custom
the
mosaic
teaching
as
to
sacredness
of
first
fruits
under
judaism
dedicated
to
the
lord
of
heaven
doubtless
was
in
part
the
origin
of
the
claim
of
the
feudal
lord
the
law
of
primogeniture
or
precedence
of
the
first
born
son
as
the
beginning
of
his
father
s
strength
is
also
a
translation
from
judaism
into
the
customs
of
many
nations
but
nowhere
under
the
law
of
primogeniture
at
the
present
day
does
even
a
first
born
daughter
receive
as
high
consideration
as
a
first
born
son
this
is
especially
noticeable
in
royal
families
it
is
not
therefore
singular
that
men
who
took
the
literal
sense
of
the
bible
in
science
who
believed
that
the
world
had
been
created
in
six
days
this
work
having
so
greatly
fatigued
the
lord
almighty
as
to
make
rest
of
the
seventh
day
necessary
for
him
should
under
example
of
that
lord
claim
the
first
fruits
in
all
their
possessions
no
christians
of
the
present
day
except
the
mormons
so
fully
base
their
lives
upon
the
teachings
of
the
bible
as
the
catholics
of
the
middle
ages
if
we
accord
divine
authority
to
this
book
accepting
the
literal
word
as
infallible
and
sacred
we
must
admit
that
both
church
and
state
were
at
this
period
in
unison
with
its
teachings
and
even
during
the
nineteenth
century
have
not
freed
themselves
from
the
stigma
of
sustaining
woman
s
degradation
the
theory
of
the
feudal
ages
remains
the
same
although
the
practice
is
somewhat
different
legal
bigamy
or
polygamy
unions
are
common
in
every
large
city
of
christendom
government
license
has
created
a
class
in
many
european
countries
devoted
to
the
most
degraded
lives
under
government
sanction
protection
and
control
in
england
known
as
queen
s
women
government
thus
the
state
places
itself
before
the
world
as
a
trafficker
in
women
s
bodies
for
the
vilest
purposes
the
culmination
of
nearly
two
thousand
years
of
christian
teaching
is
the
legalization
of
vice
for
women
and
the
creation
of
a
new
crime
previous
to
the
enactment
of
this
law
the
rules
of
modern
jurisprudence
held
an
accused
person
as
innocent
until
proven
guilty
under
this
legalization
of
vice
all
women
within
a
certain
radius
of
recruiting
or
other
army
stations
are
suspects
looked
upon
as
immoral
and
liable
to
arrest
examination
and
registration
upon
government
books
as
government
women
it
required
seventeen
years
of
arduous
work
to
repeal
this
law
in
england
this
legalization
of
prostitution
in
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
state
is
its
open
approval
of
that
doctrine
of
the
church
that
woman
was
created
for
man
it
is
an
acknowledgment
by
men
that
vice
is
an
inherent
quality
of
their
natures
it
is
in
accord
with
man
s
repeated
assertion
that
only
through
means
of
a
class
of
women
pursuing
immorality
as
a
business
is
any
woman
safe
from
violence

peculiar
position
in
regard
to
the
question
she
was
the
last
to
adopt
this
system
of
slavery
and
she
adopted
it
in
that
thorough
manner
which
characterizes
the
actions
of
the
race
in
no

has

law
it

is
the
endorsement
of
the

the
most
open
denial
which
modern

an

are
unchaste
shall
henceforth
be
dealt
with
not
as
human
beings
but
as
foul
sewers
or
some
such
material
nuisance
without
souls
without
rights
and
without
responsibility
when
the
leaders
of
public
opinion
in

country
have
arrived
at
such
a
point
of
combined
skepticism
and
despotism
as
to
recommend
such
a
manner
of
dealing

there
is
no
crime

although
a
long
and
active
work
through
seventeen
years
eventually
brought
about
the
repeal
of
this
law
in
england
it
still
continues
in
the
british
colonies
being
forced
upon
the
people
in
opposition
to
their
own
action
after
the
cape
parliament
of
the
colony
of
good
hope
had
repealed
the
law
sir
bartle
frere
reintroduced
it
by
means
of
an
edict
when
in
london
sir
john
pope
hennessey
governor
and
commander
in
chief
of
british
china
was
waited
upon
by
an
influential
deputation
of
members
of
parliament
and
others
to
whom
he
made
known
the
practical
workings
of
governmental
regulation
of
prostitution
introduced
by
england
into
that
colony
he
did
not
hesitate
to
characterize
it
as
a
system
of
slavery
for
the
registered
women
and
girls
he
also
declared
that
they
detested
the
life
they
are
thus
compelled
to
enter
having
both
a
dread
and
an
abhorrence
of
foreigners
especially
foreign
sailors
and
soldiers
he
said
such
chinese
girls
are
the
real
slaves
of
hong
kong
now
to
that
statement
i
adhere
i
give
it
to
you
on
the
full
authority
of
the
governor
of
the
colony
i
have
been
five
years
looking
at
the
operation
of
this
law
in
hong
kong
and
that
is
the
result
to
which
i
have
arrived
that
under
the
flag
of
england
there
is
slavery
there
but
it
is
slavery
created
and
protected
by
these
ordinances
the
relation
of
christianity
to
this
treatment
of
chinese
women
and
the
contempt
with
which
this
religion
is
regarded
by
these
heathen
is
most
fully
shown
by
sir
john
s
conversation
with
the
leading
chinese
merchant
of
canton
as
given
by
himself
upon
the
material
progress
of
the
colony
to
this
merchant
sir
pope
said
your
people
are
making
a
large
fortune
here
why
not
send
down
your
second
son
to
enter
the
house
of
the
chinese
merchant
and
learn
the
business
there
the
merchant
replied
i
can
not
for
this
reason
hong
kong
is
a
sink
of
sir
pope
hennessey
answered
this
is
a
christian
colony
we
have
been
here
now
for
forty
years
we
are
supposed
to
be
doing
the
best
we
can
to
spread
civilization
and
the
chinaman
repeated
it
is
a
sink
of
iniquity
in
my
mind
as
chinamen
we
think
of
domestic
and
family
reverence
such
how
do
i
see
the
poor
chinese
treated
in

colony
and
he
related
stories
of
the
abuses
to
which
his
countrywomen
were
subjected
in
repeating
this
conversation
to
her
majesty
s
government
sir
pope
hennessey
declared
the
words
that
the
merchant
of
canton
who
called
hong
kong
a
sink
of
iniquity
have
a
wide
application
because
the
british
colony
at
hong
kong
is
geographically
a
part
of
a
great
empire
an
empire
where
you
have
missionaries
of
various
churches
i
have
been
asked
to
explain
the
curious
and
distressing
fact
that
christianity
is
declining
in
china
i
think
it
is
declining
mainly
on
account
of
the
treaties
we
have
forced
upon
the
chinese
but
i
will
frankly
tell
you
it
is
declining
also
because
they
see
these
girls
registered
in
such
houses
for
europeans
and
made
practically
slaves
under
our
nor
are
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
china
the
sole
foreign
countries
in
which
this
system
of
the
legalized
moral
degradation
of
women
has
been
carried
by
england
nearly
one
hundred
places
in
india
showing
the
same
vice
under
license
from
the
british
government
even
to
bearing
the
same
name
nor
have
innumerable
petitions
and
protests
from
native
and
foreign
ladies
from
zenana
workers
from
missionaries
and
even
from
all
ranks
of
the
resident
english
civil
service
for
immediate
repeal
of
this
vilest
of
all
laws
been
of
the
least
effect
so
thoroughly
imbued
are
english
legislators
with
contempt
for
womanhood
as
not
only
to
maintain
these
outrageous
laws
but
also
to
cause
fear
in
the
minds
of
those
women
who
for
twenty
years
wrought
for
the
repeal
of
these
acts
in
great
britain
and
ireland
of
their
again
being
introduced
under
more
insidious
and
dangerous
form
a
memorial
signed
by
a
number
of
native
born
and
english
ladies
was
presented
to
the
viceroy
praying
that
the
age
of
protection
for
young
girls
be
raised
while
in
india
a
man
s
dog
horse
elephant
and
even
the
plants
of
his
garden
are
under
the
protection
of
english
law
his
daughter
of
ten
years
is
outside
this
protection
the
penal
code
punishes
with
imprisonment
or
a
fine
or
both
the
man
who
injures
an
animal
valued
at
ten
rupees
if
the
animal
be
worth
fifty
rupees
his
imprisonment
may
be
for
five
years
while
for
dishonestly
coaxing
his
neighbor
s
dog
to
follow
him
the
punishment
is
three
years
imprisonment
or
a
fine
or
both
while
the
man
who
induces
consent
from
a
of
ten
years
escapes
all
punishment
in
deference
to
the
bitter
opposition
these
acts
created
it
was
declared
that
legalized
prostitution
was
abolished
in
british
india
june
a
statement
was
made
in
the
house
of
commons
that
the
contagious
disease
acts
had
been
suspended
in
bombay
but
an
investigation
of
these
statements
by
the
english
social
purity
society
proved
them
false
the
its
organ
stating
june
that
upon
inquiry
it
was
found
that
the
licensing
of
prostitution
systematically
prevails
in
british
india
and
is
always
attended
with
results
most
disastrous
to
health
of
body
as
well
as
morals
of
the
community
the
most
extraordinary
course
is
taken
towards
the
accomplishment
of
their
ends
by
the
advocates
of
legalizing
vice
in
having
failed
to
secure
an
act
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
favor
a
society
to
this
end
was
formed
in
the
city
of
new
york
incorporated
as
a
voluntary
association
borrowing
the
name
used
in
england
at
the
time
its
women
were
most
degraded
by
the
state
this
society
grants
certificates
to
women
presenting
themselves
for
examination
and
thus
step
by
step
under
many
forms
more
extended
than
even
under
feudal
law
is
woman
s
moral
degradation
made
the
effort
of
christian
civilization
of
today
the
ten
thousand
licensed
women
of
the
town
of
the
city
of
hamburg
are
required
by
the
state
to
show
certificates
that
they
regularly
attended
church
and
also
partake
of
the
sacrament
and
even
in
protestant
berlin
the
capital
of
protestant
prussia
the
church
upon
demand
of
the
state
furnished
certificates
of
their
having
partaken
of
holy
communion
to
those
women
securing
license
to
lead
vicious
lives
the
very
symbol
and
body
of
him
whom
the
christian
world
worships
as
its
saviour
thus
becoming
the
key
to
unlock
the
doors
of
woman
s
moral
degradation
the
fact
of
governments
lending
their
official
aid
to
demoralization
of
woman
by
the
registration
system
shows
an
utter
debasement
of
law
this
system
is
directly
opposed
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
right
that
of
holding
of
the
accused
innocent
until
proven
guilty
which
until
now
has
been
recognized
as
a
part
of
modern
law
under
the
registration
or
license
system
all
women
within
the
radius
of
its
action
are
under
suspicion
all
women
are
held
as
morally
guilty
until
they
prove
themselves
innocent
where
this
law
is
in
force
all
women
are
under
an
irresponsible
police
surveillance
liable
to
accusation
arrest
examination
imprisonment
and
the
entrance
of
their
names
upon
the
list
of
the
lewd
women
of
the
town
upon
this
frightful
infraction
of
justice
we
have
the
sentiments
of
the
late
sheldon
amos
when
professor
of
jurisprudence
in
the
law
college
of
london
university
in
the
science
of
law
he
says
in
reference
to
this
very
wrong
the
loss
of
liberty
to
the
extent
to
which
it
exists
implies
a
degradation
of
the
state
and
if
persisted
in
can
only
lead
to
its
dissolution
no
person
or
class
of
persons
must
be
under
the
cringing
fear
of
having
imputed
to
them
offenses
of
which
they
are
innocent
and
of
being
taken
into
custody
in
consequence
of
such
imputation
they
must
not
be
liable
to
be
detained
in
custody
without
so
much
as
a
case
being
made
out
such
as
in
the
opinion
of
a
responsible
judicial
officer
leaves
a
presumption
of
guilt
they
must
not
be
liable
to
be
detained
for
an
indefinite
time
without
having
the
question
of
their
guilt
or
innocence
investigated
by
the
best
attainable
methods
when
the
fact
comes
to
be
inquired
into
the
best
attainable
methods
of
eliciting
the
truth
must
be
used
in
default
of
any
one
of
these
securities
must
be
said
to
be
proportionately
at
a
very
low
ebb
great
effort
has
been
made
to
introduce
this
system
into
the
united
states
and
a
national
board
of
health
created
by
congress
in
is
carefully
watched
lest
its
irresponsible
powers
lead
to
its
encroachment
upon
the
liberties
and
personal
rights
of
women
a
resolution
adopted
march
at
a
meeting
of
the
new
york
committee
appointed
to
thwart
the
effort
to
license
vice
in
this
country
shows
the
need
of
its
watchful
care
that
this
committee
has
learned
with
much
regret
and
apprehension
of
the
action
of
the
american
public
health
association
at
its
late
annual
meeting
in
new
orleans
in
adopting
a
sensational
report
commending
european
governmental
regulation
of
prostitution
and
looking
to
the
introduction
in
this
country
with
modifications
through
the
medium
of
state
legislative
enactments
and
municipal
ordinances
of
a
kindred
immoral
system
of
social
vice
even
the
latin
races
in
their
lowest
degradation
did
not
put
the
sanction
of
law
upon
the
open
sale
of
women
to
vice
says
butler
this
remained
for
the
and
teutonic
races
under
the
highest
christian
civilization
in
a
class
of
women
licensed
by
the
state
under
protection
and
name
of
the
head
of
the
anglican
church
as
queen
s
women
government
women
both
church
and
state
here
uniting
in
the
nefarious
business
of
making
women
by
law
the
slaves
of
man
s
lowest
nature
a
system
which
openly
declares
the
necessity
for
woman
s
foulest
degradation
in
order
to
protect
man
in
his
departure
from
the
moral
law
a
system
that
annually
sends
its
tens
of
thousands
down
to
a
death
from
which
christian
society
grants
no
resurrection
similar
religious
beliefs
beget
similar
results
times
change
and
with
them
methods
but
as
long
as
the
foundation
of
the
christian
church
of
every
name
rests
upon
the
belief
in
woman
s
created
inferiority
to
man
and
that
she
brought
sin
into
the
world
so
long
will
similar
social
industrial
and
moral
results
follow
the
catholic
greek
and
protestant
divisions
all
degrade
women
but
under
different
forms
that
the
woman
of
every
christian
land
fears
to
meet
a
man
in
a
secluded
place
by
day
or
by
night
is
of
itself
sufficient
proof
of
the
low
state
of
christian
morality
several
states
have
at
different
times
attempted
the
enactment
of
similar
laws
through
bills
introduced
into
their
legislatures
requiring
constant
watchfulness
on
part
of
the
friends
of
social
purity
lest
this
great
wrong
be
consummated
a
wrong
primarily
against
woman
in
certain
cities
as
louis
where
such
registration
and
license
was
for
some
time
demanded
the
foulest
injuries
were
perpetrated
upon
entirely
innocent
and
reputable
women
injuries
for
which
they
had
no
redress
under
the
legalized
vice
system
women
are
slaves
not
possessing
even
the
right
of
repudiating
this
kind
of
life
a
gentleman
traveling
in
france
relates
a
most
pathetic
instance
of
the
attempted
escape
and
the
forcible
return
to
the
house
of
infamy
of
a
young
girl
whose
person
there
was
at
the
command
of
every
brute
who
chose
to
pay
the
price
of
her
master
the
tram
car
in
which
this
gentleman
was
riding
crowded
with
ladies
and
girls
of
refined
appearance
was
suddenly
stopped
on
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
havre
by
a
dense
crowd
swaying
back
and
forth
across
the
track
he
said
i
then
became
aware
that
two
men
tall
powerful
fellows
were
carrying
or
rather
trying
to
carry
a
young
woman
seemingly
between
sixteen
and
eighteen
years
of
age
who
occupied
herself
in
violently
clutching
at
everything
and
anything
from
a
to
a
shop
door
handle
a
railing
and
the
pavement
itself
as
a
matter
of
course
her
body
swayed
between
the
two
men
half
dragging
on
the
pavement
her
clothing
besmeared
with
mud
and
blood
for
the
rough
handling
had
superadded
crimson
to
other
stains
this
proved
the
case
to
be
not
one
of
accident
although
the
screams
shrieks
and
cries
of
the
poor
girl
might
well
have
led
to
the
belief
of
her
having
been
the
victim
of
a
run
over
and
of
being
in
convulsions
of
acute
agony
her
agonizing
cries
for
pity
police
protection
help
murder
oh
oh
oh
were
reiterated
incessantly
at
one
particular
moment
her
contortions
and
the
violence
of
her
efforts
to
free
herself
or
even
to
bring
her
head
into
a
more
convenient
position
than
hanging
face
downward
while
a
yard
or
so
of
long
bedraggled
hair
all
loose
was
sweeping
up
the
dirt
from
the
pavement
were
so
violent
that
her
two
carriers
had
to
let
her
slip
from
their
grasp
on
to
the
flagstones
all
this
time
unmoved
by
and
totally
indifferent
to
her
piercing
cries
stood
by
or
strolled
calmly
onward
with
the
crowd
a
policeman
in
uniform
and
on
duty
my
enquiry
of
what
is
all
this
piece
of
work
about
is
it
an
accident
is
the
woman
drunk
or
what
he
smilingly
answered
oh
not
drunk
sir
not
at
all
not
at
all
it
s
only
one
of
those
young
licensed
girls
who
has
been
trying
to
escape
from
her
house
and
that
s
her
master
who
has
just
caught
her
again
and
is
carrying
her
back
to
his
place
that
s
all
i
was
powerless
to
in
many
christian
countries
a
traffic
in
girls
exists
under
government
protection
and
license
criminal
vice
chiefly
finds
its
feminine
prey
among
the
poorest
and
most
helpless
class
who
are
the
victims
of
this
new
commercial
business
its
customers
scattered
in
every
christian
land
and
accepting
their
spoil
only
upon
the
certificate
of
some
reputable
physician
as
to
their
innocence
and
previous
uncontamination
crime
vice
and
cruelty
were
never
before
so
closely
united
in
one
infamous
system
the
purchase
of
young
innocence
by
old
iniquity
under
protection
of
law
a
bill
was
introduced
into
the
english
parliament
to
check
this
business
of
girl
destruction
accompanied
by
proof
so
direct
and
proof
of
the
necessity
of
immediate
action
so
great
that
it
was
not
doubted
that
the
bill
would
pass
at
once
yet
it
encountered
secret
and
powerful
opposition
was
finally
referred
to
a
committee
already
so
overburdened
with
work
and
so
far
behindhand
that
it
was
manifest
that
the
bill
could
not
be
reached
in
years
gilded
vice
laughed
at
this
result
and
the
iniquitous
business
proceeded
as
before
at
that
period
the
mall
entered
into
an
investigation
whose
results
roused
the
whole
civilized
world
even
clergymen
ignoring
the
fact
that
christian
teaching
had
brought
this
vice
into
being
joined
the
press
in
scathing
reproof
of
patrician
london
iniquity
societies
were
formed
for
the
protection
of
young
girls
from
the
vice
of
men
who
used
the
power
of
wealth
and
station
to
corrupt
the
daughters
of
the
poor
under
english
christian
law
it
has
never
been
a
crime
to
morally
destroy
a
girl
of
thirteen
because
under
that
law
she
is
held
responsible
for
her
own
undoing
girls
of
this
tender
age
infants
in
all
that
pertains
to
the
control
of
property
incapable
of
making
a
legal
contract
because
of
immaturity
of
understanding
are
yet
held
by
that
law
as
of
age
to
protect
themselves
from
a
seducer
held
to
possess
sufficient
judgment
to
thwart
all
the
wiles
of
men
old
in
years
and
men
protected
in
their
iniquities
by
laws
of
their
own
shielded
by
the
legislation
of
their
own
who
escape
all
punishment
because
men
alone
enact
the
laws
it
is
not
alone
the
waifs
of
society
who
fall
a
prey
to
the
seducer
but
the
children
of
reputable
parents
and
good
homes
are
waylaid
on
their
way
to
and
from
school
and
lured
to
ruin
to
the
modern
ghoul
it
is
of
no
moment
upon
whom
he
preys
provided
his
victim
be
but
young
and
innocent
lecky
has
portrayed
the
standard
of
morals
of
the
present
day
as
far
higher
than
in
pagan
rome
but
we
must
be
allowed
to
doubt
this
immoral
sentiment
is
more
deftly
hidden
and
law
more
dependent
upon
public
opinion
as
soon
as
the
general
consensus
of
public
opinion
rises
in
opposition
to
girl
destruction
the
law
will
regulate
itself
in
accordance
with
this
standard
lord
shaftesbury
upon
this
point
said
the
mall
has
published
to
the
world
disclosures
of
a
most
horrible
and
many
would
think
of
an
incredible
character
not
even
the
questionings
of
peace
or
war
or
most
intricate
foreign
policy
ought
to
interfere
with
energetic
measures
to
suppress
these
evils
but
before
we
can
make
any
great
advance
there
must
be
a
considerable
move
of
public
opinion
it
must
be
vigorous
and
determined
and
i
will
tell
you
why
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
no
government
undertakes
a
question
of
a
really
important
and
social
character
until
it
has
been
forced
upon
it
by
the
voice
of
public
opinion
consequently
it
is
our
duty
to
bring
the
voice
of
that
public
opinion
to
bear
on
this
question
law
can
be
evaded
in
every
possible
way
the
only
thing
that
defies
evasion
is
a
wide
spread
and
universally
extended
public
opinion
i
hope
that
we
shall
be
able
to
create
such
a
public
opinion
throughout
the
country
that
persons
will
be
induced
to
come
forward
voluntarily
and
give
evidence
the
plague
spot
is
too
deep
too
wide
and
there
are
too
many
persons
interested
in
the
continuance
of
it
to
enable
us
easily
to
wipe
it
out
uncommon
energy
will
be
necessary
and
i
hope
we
shall
raise
such
an
amount
of
popular
indignation
that
the
effect
will
be
irresistable
but
the
public
feeling
the
public
indignation
against
these
enormities
did
not
rise
to
the
height
of
restrictive
legislation
the
policy
of
a
portion
both
of
the
english
and
the
american
press
was
that
of
suppression
upon
the
plea
that
a
knowledge
of
these
crimes
would
be
injurious
to
the
morals
of
society
suppression
was
also
the
aim
of
the
royal
princes
dukes
nobles
and
leading
men
who
were
the
principal
patrons
and
supporters
of
this
nefarious
system
suppression
is
the
strongest
opposing
weapon
against
reform
to
compel
change
needs
light
and
discussion
it
is
only
when
wrongs
find
a
tongue
that
they
become
woman
legally
powerless
in
the
doing
away
with
abuses
or
the
punishment
of
crime
must
depend
upon
publicity
for
the
creation
of
a
public
sentiment
in
her
favor
one
of
the
most
remarkable
facts
connected
with
disclosures
of
this
crime
against
womankind
was
the
extent
to
which
men
of
all
ages
and
character
were
found
identified
with
it
the
world
of
business
and
that
of
politics
were
equally
as
well
known
in
the
haunts
of
vice
as
in
the
outside
world
but
they
were
judged
by
a
different
standard
and
their
relative
importance
was
altogether
changed
it
was
a
literal
day
of
judgment
in
which
evil
character
deftly
hidden
during
public
life
was
there
unveiled
the
most
horribly
striking
fact
connected
with
this
investigation
was
the
extreme
youth
of
these
victims
the
report
of
the
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
declared
the
evidence
proved
beyond
doubt
that
juvenile
vice
from
an
almost
incredibly
early
age
was
increasing
at
an
appalling
extent
in
england
and
especially
in
london
ten
thousand
girls
thirteen
fourteen
and
fifteen
years
of
age
had
been
drawn
into
this
vice
an
english
paper
declaring
the
ignorance
of
these
girls
to
be
almost
incredible
the
condition
of
these
is
far
more
horrible
than
that
of
the
victims
of
infant
marriage
in
syria
egypt
india
the
infant
victims
of
christian
lands
are
more
fully
destroyed
soon
becoming
mental
physical
and
moral
wrecks
alternate
imbecility
and
wild
screaming
being
common
among
these
child
victims
of
vice
christianity
created
the
modern
brothel
which
as
closely
follows
in
the
wake
of
evangelical
work
of
the
moody
and
sankey
style
as
did
public
women
the
ancient
church
councils
while
in
the
past
the
legal
wrongs
of
woman
in
the
marriage
relation
in
which
she
is
robbed
of
name
personality
earnings
children
had
a
tendency
to
drive
her
to
live
with
man
outside
of
the
authority
of
church
or
state
the
occupations
recently
opened
to
her
whereby
she
can
gain
a
reputable
livelihood
by
her
own
exertions
has
greatly
increased
the
ranks
of
single
women
no
longer
compelled
to
marry
for
a
home
or
position
the
number
of
young
girls
who
voluntarily
refrain
from
marriage
by
choice
living
single
increases
each
year
no
longer
driven
to
immorality
for
bread
a
great
diminution
has
taken
place
in
the
ranks
of
public
no
longer
forced
by
want
into
this
life
the
lessening
number
of
such
women
not
meeting
the
requirements
of
patrons
of
vice
resulted
in
the
organization
of
a
regular
system
for
the
abduction
imprisonment
sale
and
exportation
of
young
girls
england
and
germany
most
largely
controlling
this
business
although
belgium
holland
and
france
switzerland
several
countries
of
south
america
canada
and
the
united
states
are
to
some
extent
also
engaged
in
this
most
infamous
traffic
foreign
traffic
in
young
english
girls
was
known
to
exist
long
before
the
revelation
of
the
mall
made
english
people
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
same
system
under
the
home
government
it
was
this
widely
extended
and
thoroughly
organized
commerce
in
which
roused
a
few
people
to
earnest
effort
against
it
and
secured
the
formation
of
a
society
called
prevention
of
traffic
in
english
to
the
chairman
of
this
society
benjamin
scott
was
the
first
official
suggestion
due
that
terminated
in
that
investigation
by
editor
stead
which
for
a
moment
shook
the
civilized
world
and
held
christian
england
to
light
as
a
center
of
the
vilest
most
odious
most
criminal

ever
knew
london
the
great

the
largest
city

acknowledged
by
statisticians
and

to
be
the
point
where
crime

despair

are
found
in
their

ever

a

to

in

of

paralleled
by
the
of

and
youth
through
vices
that

hesitates
to

is
the
result
of
that

for
years
tacitly
consented
to
the
destruction

the
of

poor
at
the
rate
of

thousand
annually
england
was

greatly
shocked
to
find
its

of
tender
age
and
aristocratic

sunken
in
a
mire
of
immorality

the
highest
institution
of
its
kind
in
great
britain
having
in
charge
the
education
of
boys
connected
with
the
most
illustrious
english
families
recently
became
the
source
of
a
scandal
which
involved
a
great
number
of
students
an
extensive
secret
inquiry
resulted
in
the
suspension
of
nearly
three
hundred
boys
after
full
confession
supplied
with
unlimited
pocket
money
they
had
bribed
parkkeepers
and
the
police
to
silence
but
a
few
years
previous
to
these
disclosures
in
reference
to
eton
the
civilized
world
was
horrified
at
the
discovery
of
the
vice
which
destroyed
sodom
among
some
of
the
most
wealthy
aristocratic
young
men
of
london
and
yet
with
knowledge
of
the
depravity
into
which
this
most
christian
city
had
sunk
the
shocking
character
of
the
disclosures
of
the
mall
in
reference
to
the
traffic
in
young
girls
involved
details
of
vice
so
atrocious
as
to
exceed
belief
had
not
the
testimony
been
of
the
most
convincing
character
these
mere
children
were
lured
by
the
most
diabolical
vices
into
traps
where
by
drugs
force
or
cajoling
tens
of
thousands
were
brought
to
moral
and
physical
ruin
innocent
victims
of
a
religious
theory
which
through
the
christian
ages
has
trained
men
into
a
belief
that
woman
was
but
created
as
a
plaything
for
their
passions
that
boys
of
the
highest
families
in
the
earliest
years
of
their
adolescence
should
voluntarily
associate
with
those
vicious
women
who
form
a
class
created
by
the
public
sentiment
of
man
as
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
feminine
element
in
households
is
not
surprising
to
a
philosophic
observer
it
was
the
direct
result
of
an
adequate
cause
the
wrong
to
woman
passed
so
silently
by

its
culmination
in
the
destruction
of

suspension
was
tenderness

from
that
school
ruining
a

future
succeeding
the
revelation
of
london

came
divulgence
of
similar
shameless
practices
on
the
part
of
high
government
officials
and
men
foremost
in

life
in
the
canadian
colonies
in
ottawa

upon
this
side
of

wholesale
despoliation
of
young

but
too
closely
paralleled

cities
these
were
closely
followed
by
the
revelations
in

to
the
pineries
of
the
united
states
to
whose
camps
women
are
decoyed
under
pretense
of
good
situations
and
high
wages
into
a
life
whose
horrors
are
not
equaled
in
any
other
part
of
the
christian

with
this
infamy
among
the
notable
facts
due
to
an
investigation

that
its

largely
comes
from

i
saw

i
have
something
to
tell
you
more
astonishing
than
that

iniquity
are
supported
by
wealthy

when
i
tell
you
that

broken

i
cry
out
against
this
popular
iniquity
such
men
must
be
cast
out

not

lift
the

of
malediction
from

principles
whose

better
off

yet
so
pronounced
in
difference
are
the
moral
codes
by
which
men
and

are
judged
that
while
living
together
in
unlegalized
marital
relations
the
man
is
welcomed
into
society
is
looked
upon
as
fit
for
marriage
with
the
most
innocent
young
girl

should
he
partially
condone
the
wrong
done

life
under
present
condition
of
society
he
has
ruined
by
marriage
with
her
society
for
this
one
reputable
act
brands
him
as
most
unworthy
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
a
cavalry
officer
in
washington
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
dismissal
from
the
army
on
charge
of
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
because
of
his
legally
marrying
a
woman
with
whom
he
had
been
living
what
a
commentary
upon
christian
civilization
while
living
an
illicit
relation
with
this
woman
he
was
regarded
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
when
taking
upon
himself
a
legal
relation
he
was
lecky
says
much
of
our
own
feeling
on
this
subject
is
due
to
laws
and
moral
systems
which
were
founded
by
men
and
were
in
the
first
instance
designed
for
their
own
as
far
as
he
has
examined
this
question
lecky
is
correct
but
he
has
failed
to
touch
the
primal
cause
of
such
laws
and
church
doctrine
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
to
man
view
these
questions
from
any
standpoint
the
cause
remains
the
same
to
this
cause
we
trace
the
crime
and
criminals
of
society
today
to
this
cause
the
darkness
of
an
age
which
has
not
yet
realized
that
civilization
means
a
recognition
of
the
rights
of
others
at
every
point
of
contact
to
the
honor
of
the
pulpit
the
sins
of
men
are
occasionally
made
the
subject
of
condemnation
evangelist
davidson
preaching
in
syracuse
y
said
i
pray
god
to
haste
the
day
when
vice
in
man
will
be
marked
by
society
the
same
as
in
woman
i
know
all
the
popular
theories
you
admit
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
a
woman
there
are
poor
women
who
are
driven
to
it
and
you
are
the
ones
who
drive
them
you
smile
at
the
one
thing
in
this
sermon
that
ought
to
make
a
thinking
man
cry
the
world
is
so
depraved
that
you
laugh
at
the
very
idea
of
a
man
s
saying
he
is
a
pure
man
like
lecky
davidson
was
correct
as
far
as
he
went
but
he
too
failed
to
reach
the
cause
of
this
double
code
of
morals
he
did
not
touch
it
because
in
striking
that
he
would
strike
a
blow
at
the
very
foundations
of
the
church
christendom
is
percolated
with
immorality
large
cities
and
small
towns
alike
giving
daily
proof
legislative
and
police
investigations
substantiate
this
statement
woman
s
protective
agencies
and
private
investigations
alike
proclaim
the
same
fact
as
under
the
same
organic
teachings
results
must
continue
the
same
we
find
the
united
states
no
more
free
from
immorality
than
european
lands
catholic
countries
no
more
vile
than
protestant
although
feudal
law
no
longer
exists
men

and

beliefs
their
desires
their
passions

the
laws
under
which
the
degradation
of
woman
still
continues
evil
consequences
are
not
confined
to
the
past
to
days
of
comparative
ignorance
and
tyranny
and
in
no
country
has
the
effect
of
belief
in
woman
as
a
mere
instrument
for
men
s
pleasure
produced
more
horrible
results
than
in
our
own
not

speak
of
the
effort
made
in
congress
a
few
years
since
to
place
all
women
of
the
country
under
suspect
law
many
cities
among
them
washington
philadelphia
syracuse
have
at
different
periods
taken
initial
steps
towards
a
prohibition
of
a
woman
s
appearing
in
the
street
by
male
escort
during
the
evening
even
its
earliest
hours
such
ordinances
primarily
directed
against
working
girls
whose
chief
time
for
out
of

exercise
and
recreation

brutal
outrages
that

only
from
two

twelve

there
have
yet
no
laws

little
attention
have

given
that
policemen

are

abetting

emissaries

young

between
thirteen
and
sixteen

to
kidnap

when
once
in

of
these
men
their
hair
is
cut

they
may
be
known
a

of

of
the
girls
exists
between
the
many
hundred
such
dens
where
clubs
whips
and
irons
are
the
instruments
to
hold
them
in

the
york
sent
a
representative
disguised
as
a
woodman
in
order
to
investigate
the
truth
of
these
statements
he
found
these
houses
surrounded
by
stockades
thirty
feet
in
height
the
one
door
guarded
night
and
day
by
a
man
with
a
rifle
while
within
were
a
number
of
chained
that
were
let
loose
if
a
girl
attempted
escape
certain
men
even
in
these
forest
depths
are
especially
noted
for
their
cruelty
to
these
victims
who
are
compelled
with
club
and
whips
to
obey
the
master
of
the
den
suicide
the
only
door
of
escape
is
frequent
among
these

who
almost
without
exception
were
secured
under
promise
of
respectable
employment
at
green
bay
duluth
or
other
points
from
forty
to
girls
are
found
at
the
largest
of
such
pinery
dens
the
reporter
saw
them
strung
up
by
the
thumbs
beaten
with
clubs
kicked
by
drunken
brutes
and
driven
with
switches
over
the
snow
he
afterwards
interviewed
a
rescued
girl
who
had
engaged
to
work
in
a
lumberman
s
hotel
supposing
it
to
be
a
respectable
place
but
instead
she
was
taken
to
a
rough
building
surrounded
by
a
slab
fence
nearly
twenty
feet
in
height
within
which
was
a
cordon
of
thirteen
bull
dogs
chained
to
iron
stakes
driven
in
the
ground
many
of
the
details
given
by
this
girl
are
too
horrible
for
relation
three
times
she
tried
to
escape
and
three
times
she
was
caught
and
beaten
the
visitors
by
whom
she
tried
to
smuggle
notes
to
the
outer
world
would
hand
them
to
the
proprietor
who
liberally
paid
for
such
treason
even
county
officers
visited
the
place
to
drink
and
dance
with
the
girls
who
were
not
permitted
to
refuse
any
request
of
the
visitors
a
complaint
of
any
kind
even
of
sickness
meant
a
whipping
frequently
with
a
rawhide
upon
the
naked
body
some
times
with
the
butt
of
a
revolver
many
wield
a
powerful
influence
in
the
local
elections
one
of
the
worst
of
such
after
paying
the
constable
twelve
dollars
for
the
return
of
a
girl
who
had
tried
to
escape
beat
her
with
a
revolver
until
tired
and
was
then
only
prevented
by
a
woodman
from
turning
loose
a
bull
dog
upon
her
but
such
was
his
political
influence
that
he
was
elected
justice
of
the
peace
the
following
spring
under
the
head
of
white
slaves
in
michigan
the
york
of
january
published
a
special
dispatch
from
detroit
in
regard
to
the
case
of
a
rescued
girl
detroit
of
the
infamous
resorts
maintained
in
the
new
iron
region
in
the
upper
peninsulas
near
the
wisconsin
state
line
was
raided
last
september
by
the
sheriff
s
officers
hers
is
the
first
word
to
reach
the
world
direct
from
one
of
those
dens
many
of
the
details
she
gave
were
too
horrible
to
be
even
hinted
on
the
strength
of
inducements
now
familiar
she
went
to
work
in
a
lumberman
s
hotel
in
the
north
she
went
accompanied
by
another
girl
both
believing
the
situation
to
be
respectable
she
and
her
companion
were
taken
to
a
rough
two
story
building
four
and
a
half
miles
from
iron
mountain
in
wisconsin
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
slab
fence
nearly
twenty
feet
high
within
which
about
the
building
was
a
cordon
of
bull
dogs
thirteen
in
number
chained
to
iron
stakes
driven
into
the
ground
she
said
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
i
was
not
knocked
down
and
kicked
several
times
when
i
was
undressed
for
bed
i
was
beaten
with
a
rawhide
on
my
bare
back
there
were
always
from
eleven
to
girls
in
the
house
and
i
did
not
fare
a
bit
worse
than
the
rest
a
complaint
of
any
kind
even
of
sickness
meant
a
whipping
every
time
when
the
log
drives
were
going
on
there
would
be
hundreds
of
men
there
night
and
day
they
were
not
human
beings
but
fiends
and
we
were
not
allowed
to
refuse
any
request
of
them
oh
it
was
awful
awful
i
would
rather
stay
in
this
prison
until
i
die
than
to
go
back
there
for
one
day
i
tried
to
escape
three
times
and
was
caught
they
unchained
the
dogs
and
let
them
get
so
near
me
that
i
cried
out
in
terror
and
begged
them
to
take
the
dogs
away
and
i
would
go
back
then
of
course
i
was
beaten
i
tried
too
to
smuggle
out
notes
to
the
sheriff
by
visitors
but
they
would
take
them
to
the
proprietor
instead
and
he
would
pay
them
once
i
did
get
a
note
to
the
deputy
sheriff
at
florence
and
he
came
and
inquired
but
the
proprietor
gave
him
and
he
went
away
i
was
awfully
beaten
then
while
i
lived
the
life
from
march
until
september
two
inmates
died
both
from
brutal
treatment
they
were
as
good
as
murdered
nearly
all
the
girls
came
without
knowing
the
character
of
the
house
at
first
implored
to
get
away
the
county
officers
came
to
the
places
to
drink
and
dance
with
the
girls
they
are
controlled
by
a
rich
man
in
iron
mountain
who
owns
the
houses
and
rents
them
for
a
month
i
am
years
old
and
was
a
healthy
woman
when
i
went
into
the
first
house
weighing
pounds
i
was
transferred
to
the
house
from
which
i
was
released
by
the
officers
in
august
last
when
i
left
it
i
weighed
i
now
weigh
less
when
i
go
home
i
will
be
a
good
woman
if
i
can
only
let
liquor
alone
i
was
forced
to
drink
that
while
the
traffic
in
girls
from
one
part
of
the
american
continent
to
another
is
under
a
well
organized
plan
that
seldom
meets
discovery
although
a
trader
of
this
character
is
now
serving
a
sentence
in
sing

for
sending

to

three
decoyed
young
girls
found
in
jamaica
were
happily
returned
uninjured
to
their

from
canada
girls
are
imported
to
the
large
cities
of
the
united
states
the
prices
paid
to
agents
depend
upon
a
girl
s
youth
and
beauty
varying
from

the
traffic
at
ottawa
resembled
that
of
london
in
that
prominent
citizens
leading
politicians
and
members
of
the

were
implicated
the
number
of
women
and

constantly
reported
missing
is
startling
in
its
great
extent

the

one
of
its
reporters
into
the
pineries
of
wisconsin
to
trace
a
little
girl
living
on
state
street
of
that
city
who
went
one
evening
to
get
a
pitcher
of
milk
and
did
not
return
not
a
month
scarcely
a
week
passes
that
the
disappearance
of
some
woman
girl
or
child
is
not
chronicled
through
the
press
besides
the
infinitely
greater
numbers
of
whom
the
world
never
hears
as
it
was
abroad
so
in
our
own
country
no
energetic
steps
are
taken
to
put
an
end
to
these
foul
wrongs
woman
herself
is
needed
in
the
seats
of
justice
woman
must
become
a
responsible
factor
in
government
in
order
to
the
enactment
of
laws
which
shall
protect
her
own
sex
the
spring
of
the
called

to
the
continuance
of
this
condition
of
things
marinette
april
years
ago
when
the
exposed
the
pinery
dens
of
wisconsin
marinette
was
known
as
the
wickedest
city
in
the
country
it
was
the
rendezvous
of
every
species
of
bad
men
thugs
thieves
and
gamblers
practically
held
possession
of
the
town
their
influence
was
felt
in
all
municipal
affairs
certain
officers
of
the
law
seemed
in
active
sympathy
with
them
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
secure
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
men
guilty
of
infamous
crimes
dives
of
the
vilest
character
ran
open
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
their
inmates
recruited
from
all
parts
of
the
country
by
the
subtle
arts
of
well
known
procurers
were
kept
in
a
state
of
abject
slavery
iron
balls
and
chains
suffocating
cords
and
the
whistling
lash
were
used
on
refractory
girls
and
women
the
dens
were
surrounded
by
stockades
and
savage
dogs
were
kept
unmuzzled
to
scare
those
who
might
try
to
escape
bodies
of
victims
were
sometimes
found
in
the
woods
but
the
discovery
was
rarely
followed
by
investigation
the
dive
keepers
were
wealthy
and
knew
how
to
ease
the
conscience
of
any
officer
the
outburst
of
indignation
which
followed
the
exposure
compelled
certain
reforms
in
the
neighborhood
sporadic
efforts
were
made
to
clean
out
the
criminal
element
restrictions
were
placed
on
saloons
and
gambling
houses
stockades
and
bloodhounds
were
removed
from
the
dives
near
the
woods
and
gradually
an
air
of
crept
over
the
district
but
the
snake
was
scotched
not
killed
for
a
time
more
attention
was
paid
to
the
proprieties
vice
and
crime
were
not
so
open
as
formerly
by
degrees
however
the
old
conditions
assumed
sway
again
games
of
every
kind
were
run
openly
night
and
day
dives
and
dance
halls
have
been
thronged
and
the
usual
quota
of
men
from
the
woods
deliberately
robbed
of
their
winter
s
savings
man
s
assertion
that
he
protects
woman
is
false
under
laws
solely
enacted
by
men
young
girls
in
christian
countries
are
held
as
assenting
to
their
own
degradation
at
an
age
so
tender
that
their
evidence
would
not
be
received
in
courts
of
law
nor
are
these
the
laws
of
a
remote
age
come
down
to
the
present
time
as
late
as
the
kansas
state
senate
voted
to
that
a
girl
of
twelve
years
was
of
sufficiently
responsible
age
to
consent
to
take
the
first
step
in
immorality
the
same
senate
afterwards
unanimously
voting
that
a
boy
of
sixteen
years
was
not
old
enough
to
decide
for
himself
in
regard
to
smoking
cigarettes
it
should
be
remembered
that
youth
is
the
most
impressible
season
of
life
as
well
as
the
most
inexperienced
young
girls
from
thirteen
to
sixteen
mere
children
are
most
easily
decoyed
their
youth
and
innocence
causing
them
to
fall
the
readiest
prey
and
scarcely
a
large
city
but
proves
the
existence
of
men
of
mature
years
whose
aim
is
the
destruction
of
such
young
girls
the
state
of
delaware
yet
more
infamous
still
retaining
seven
years
as
the
age
of
seven
short
years
of
baby
life
in
that
state
is
legally
held
to
transform
a
into
a
being
with
capacity
to
consent
to
an
act
of
which
she
neither
knows
the
name
nor
the
consequences
her
consent
freeing
from
responsibility
or
punishment
the
villain
youthful
or
aged
who
chooses
to
assault
such
baby
victim
of
laws
while
the
doors
of
irresponsible
vice
are
legally
thrown
open
to
men
of
all
ages
with
girl
victims
as
their
prey
the
restrictions
against
marriage
with
a
minor
without
the
parents
consent
are
in
most
states
very
severe
that
the
herself
has
consented
to
the
marriage
ceremony
is
of
no
weight
where
a
legitimate
union
is
under
consideration
she
is
held
as
possessing
no
power
to
form
a
contract
and
can
be
arrested
under
a
writ
of
and
kept
from
her
husband
at
her
father
s
pleasure
instances
have
also
occurred
where
the
wife
has
been
punished
by
him
for
thus
daring
to
marry
both
the
husband
and
the
officiating
clergyman
are
also
held
amenable
the
former
under
charge
of
abduction
the
latter
as
an
accessory
in
performing
the
marriage
ceremony
a
significant
fact
is
the
rapid
increase
of
child
criminals
throughout
christendom
germany
france
and
england
showing
one
hundred
per
cent
within
ten
years
while
in
the
united
states
more
than
the
inmates
of
state
prisons
are
under
thirty
years
of
age
from
criminals
it
is
necessary
to
look
back
to
men
sitting
in
earth
s
loftiest
places
and
note
the
fact
that
crime
germs
are
not
alone
generated
with
the
child
but
that
through
the
gestative
period
the
mother
a
religious
and
legal
slave
struggles
between
a
newly
awakened
sense
of
that
responsibility
which
within
the
last
four
decades
has
come
to
woman
and
the
crushing
influence
of
religious
political
and
family
despotism
which
still
overshadows
her
moralists
have
long
striven
for
the
suppression
of
immorality
by
efforts
directed
to
the
reformation
of
corrupt
women
alone
for
two
reasons
they
have
been
unsuccessful
first
the
majority
of
women
entering
this
life
are
found
to
have
done
so
under
the
pressure
of
abject
poverty
and
as
long
as
the
conditions
of
society
continue
to
foster
poverty
for
woman
it
was
impossible
to
create
a
marked
change
in
morals
second
all
efforts
were
directed
towards
the
smallest
and
least
culpable
class
as
it
has
been
proven
that
ten
men
of
immoral
life
are
required
for
the
support
of
one
woman
of
like
character
in
london
alone
with
its
population
of
five
millions
women
of
its
population
are
thus
enumerated
requiring
men
of
its
population
for
their
support
recognizing
the
fact
that
men
not
women
were
most
sunken
in
vice
the
number
leading
vicious
lives
very
much
larger
the
degradation
of
these
men
very
much
greater

she
said
to
understand
that
he
who
degrades
a
fellow
creature
commits
a
crime
the
crime
of
high
treason
against
humanity
in
quick
response
to
those
words
the
women
of
many
countries
combined
in
the
work
of
man
s
reformation
in
an
organization
known
as
the

in
by
miss
ellice
hopkins
of
england
and
now
possessing
branches
in
every
part
of
the
civilized
world
to
this
society
men
alone
belong
its
work
is
of
a
still
broader
character
than
mere
reformation
of
the
vicious
it
seeks
to
train
young
men
and
boys
to
a
proper
respect
for
woman
and
for
themselves
as
the
world
is
indebted
to
christine
of
pisa
for
the
first
public
protest
against
the
immorality
of
christendom
so
to
josephine
butler
madam

are
due
the
inauguration
of
a
new
moral
standard
for

whose
results
must
be
of
incalculable
value
to
the
world
the
white

is
a
simply
organized
society
without
an
admission

but
requiring
adherence
to
a
obligation
binding
its
members
to
purity
of
thought
and
action
and
maintaining
that
the
law
of
chastity
is
equally
binding
on
men
and
women
the
international
federation
a
union
existing
in
several
european
countries
its
chief
object
work
against
state
protection
of
vice
roused
public
thought
in
this
direction
as
never
before
people
began
to
comprehend
that
a
large
vicious
class
was
common
to
every
community
a
class
whose
reclamation
had
never
been
systematically
attempted
never
thought
necessary
or
even
deemed
possible
because
of
the
religious
and
social
training
that
taught
indulgence
in
vice
to
be
a
necessity
of
man
s
nature
and
the
coordinate
statement
that
protection
to
the
majority
of
women
was
to
be
secured
only
through
the
debasement
and
moral
degradation
of
the
minority
for
many
hundreds
of
years
this
has
been
man
s
treatment
of
the
question
of
vice
in
christian
lands
but
as
soon
as
advancing
civilization
permitted
woman
s
thought
to
be
publicly
heard
vice
in
man
was
declared
to
be
upon
the
same
basis
as
vice
in
woman
had
not
man
been
trained
by
his
religion
into
a
belief
that
woman
was
created
for
him
had
not
the
church
for
and
more
years
preached
woman
s
moral
debasement
the
long
course
of
legislation
for
them
as
slaves
would
never
have
taken
place
nor
the
obstacles
in
way
of
change
been
so
numerous
and
so
persistent
for
nine
years
the
criminal
reform
act
was
before
parliament
during
that
period
petitions
speeches
and
appeals
of
every
kind
in
favor
of
its
passage
were
made
by
those
outside
the
halls
of
legislation
aided
by
a
few
honest
men
within
but
the
vicious
and
immoral
fought
the
act
with
energy
despite
the
fact
that
the
women
of
their
own
families
were
exposed
to
destruction
through
government
protected
iniquity
the
bitter
opposition
by
legislators
to
this
act
is
an
additional
proof
that
woman
can
not
trust
man
in
the
state
to
any
greater
extent
than
in
the
church
until
woman
holds
political
power
in
her
own
hands
her
efforts
for
protective
legislation
will
be
arduous
and
protracted
among
the
customs
of
the
early
christian
church
we
are
able
to
trace
the
inception
of
marquette
the
mundium
the
legalization
of
vice
and
crimes
of
kindred
character
with
exception
of
among
some
savage
races
that
woman
should
appear
unclothed
before
man
has
been
regarded
as
evidence
of
the
deepest
sensuality
yet
throughout
the
history
of
christianity
from
its
earliest
years
when
women
were
required
to
divest
themselves
of
clothing
before
baptism
down
to
the
endowment
house
ceremonies
of
the
mormon
church
we
constantly
find
proof
of
like
sensual
exactions
by
the
fathers
priests
and
lay
masculinity
of
the
church
during
the
earliest
days
of
christianity
women
were
baptized
quite
nude
in
the
presence
of
men
by
men
their
bodies
being
afterwards
anointed
with
oil
by
the
priest
who
had
baptized
them
one
of
the
earliest
schisms
in
the
church
arose
from
the
protest
of
women
against
this
indignity
their
demand
to
be
allowed
to
baptize
those
of
their
own
sex
and
the
opposition
of
men
to
this
demand
the
early
bishops
of
the
church
strenuously
used
their
influence
against
the
baptism
of
nude
women
by
elders
of
their
own
sex
women
were
sometimes
brought
entirely
nude
upon
the
stage
at
rome
but
it
was
in
connection
with
religious
representation
the
theater
at
that
period
being
an
element
of
religious
teaching
lecky
speaks
of
the
undisguised
sensuality
of
this
practice
what
must
be
our
conception
of
a
christian
custom
that
placed
nude
maidens
and
wives
in
the
very
hands
of
men
not
alone
for
baptism
but
also
for
anointing
with
oil
nude
baptism
is
still
practiced
when
converts
are
received
into
the
greek
church
no
position
or
station
in
life
excusing
from
it
catharine
the
first
wife
of
peter
the
great
being
baptized
in
this
primitive
christian
manner
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
a
work
upon
the
seven
sacraments
set
certain
days
in
which
female
penitents
were
to
appear
entirely
unclothed
before
the
confessor
in
order
that
he
might
discipline
them
on
account
of
their
sins
although
toward
the
beginning
of
the
iv
century
people
began
to
speak
of
the
nocturnal
meeting
of
witches
and
sorcerers
under
the
name
of
assembly
of
diana
or
herodia
it
was
not
until
canon
or
church
law
had
become
quite
engrafted
upon
the
civil
law
that
the
full
persecution
for
witchcraft
arose
a
witch
was
held
to
be
a
woman
who
had
deliberately
sold
herself
to
the
evil
one
who
delighted
in
injuring
others
and
who
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
the
enormity
of
her
evil
acts
choose
the
sabbath
day
for
the
performance
of
her
most
impious
rites
and
to
whom
all
black
animals
had
special
relationship
the
black
cat
in
many
countries
being
held
as
her
principal
familiar
to
go
to
the
sabbath
signified
taking
part
in
witch
orgies
the
possession
of
a
pet
of
any
kind
at
this
period
was
dangerous
to
woman
one
who
had
tamed
a
frog
was
condemned
to
be
burned
in
consequence
the
harmless
amphibian
being
looked
upon
as
a
familiar
of
satan
the
devil
ever
being
depicted
in
sermon
or
story
as
black
all
black
animals
by
an
easy
transition
of
ideas
became
associated
with
evil
and
witches
although
i
have
referred
to
witchcraft
as
having
taken
on
a
new
phase
soon
after
the
confirmation
of
celibacy
as
a
dogma
of
the
church
by
the
lateran
council
of
it
yet
requires
a
chapter
by
itself
in
order
to
show
to
what
proportions
this
form
of
heresy
arose
and
the
method
of
the
church
in
its
treatment
this
period
was
the
age
of
supreme
despair
for
woman
death
by
fire
being
the
common
form
of
witch
punishment
black
cats
were
frequently
burned
with
a
witch
at
the
stake
during
the
reign
of
louis
xv
of
france
sacks
of
condemned
cats
were
burned
upon
the
public
square
devoted
to
witch
torture
cats
and
witches
are
found
depicted
together
in
a
curious
cut
on
the
title
page
of
a
book
printed
in
the
proverbial
nine
lives
of
a
cat
were
associated
in
the
minds
of
people
with
the
universally
believed
possible
metamorphosis
of
a
witch
into
a
cat
so
firmly
did
the
diabolical
nature
of
the
black
cat
impress
itself
upon
the
people
that
its
effects
are
felt
in
business
to
this
day
the
skin
of
black
cats
being
less
prized
and
of
less
value
in
the
fur
market
than
those
of
other
colors
a
curious
exemplification
of
this
inherited
belief
is
found
in
great
britain
an
english
taxidermist
who
exports
thousands
of
mounted
kittens
each
year
to
the
united
states
and
other
countries
finds
the
prejudice
against
black
cats
still
so
great
that
he
will
not
purchase
kittens
of
this
obnoxious
color
in
the
minds
of
many
people
black
seems
ineradicably
connected
with
sorcery
in
the
lore
of
it
is
stated
that
as
recently
as
a
woman
was
publicly
accused
of
witchcraft
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
on
account
of
her
administering
three
drops
of
a
black
cat
s
blood
to
a
child
as
a
remedy
for
the
croup
she
admitted
the
fact
but
denied
that
witchcraft
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
twenty
witnesses
were
called
to
prove
its
success
as
a
remedy
from
an
early
period
the
belief
in
metamorphosis
by
means
of
magical
power
was
common
throughout
christendom
augustine
relates
that
hostesses
or
innkeepers
sometimes
put
confections
into
a
kind
of
cheese
made
by
them
and
travelers
eating
thereof
were
presently
metamorphosed
into
laboring
beasts
as
horses
asses
or
it
was
also
believed
that
the
power
of
changing
into
various
animals
was
possessed
by
witches
themselves
at
the
present
day
under
certain
forms
of
insanity
persons
imagine
themselves
to
be
animals
birds
and
even
inanimate
things
as
glass
but
usually
those
hallucinations
occur
in
isolated
instances
but
among
the
strange
epidemics
which
have
at
various
times
affected
christendom
none
is
more
singular
than
that
lycanthropia
or
wolf
madness
which
attacked
such
multitudes
of
inhabitants
of
the
jura
in
as
to
become
a
source
of
great
public
danger
the
affected
persons
walked
upon
their
feet
and
hands
until
their
palms
became
hard
and
horny
they
howled
like
wolves
and
as
wolves
do
they
hunted
in
packs
murdering
and
devouring
many
children
nor
could
the
most
severe
punishment
put
an
end
to
this
general
madness
six
hundred
persons
were
executed
upon
their
own
confessions
which
included
admissions
of
compact
with
the
devil
attendance
upon
the
sabbath
and
cannibal
feasting
upon
a
mountain
the
devil
having
used
his
power
for
their
transmutation
into
wolves
witches
were
believed
to
ride
through
the
air
upon
animals
or
bits
of
wood
the
fact
of
their
possession
of
such
powers
is
asserted
by
many
writers

although
the
confirmation
by
the
church
in
the
xiii
century
of
the
supreme
holiness
of
celibacy
inaugurated
a
new
era
of
persecution
for
witchcraft
a
belief
in
its
existence
had
from
the
earliest
times
been
a
doctrine
of
the
church
augustine
as
shown
giving
the
weight
of
his
authority
in
favor
but
to
the
christian
emperor
charlemagne
in
the
eighth
century
the
first
use
of
torture
in
accusation
of
witchcraft
is
due
this
great
emperor
while
defying
the
power
of
the
pope
over
whom
he
even
claimed
jurisdiction
was
himself
a
religious
autocrat
whose
severity
exceeded
even
that
of
the
papal
throne
torture
was
rapidly
adopted
over
europe
and
soon
became
general
in
the
church
the
council
of
salzburg
publicly
ordering
its
use
in
witch
trials
a
new
era
of
persecution
and
increased
priestly
power
dates
to
the
reign
of
charlemagne
who
although
holding
himself
superior
to
the
pope
as
regarded
independent
action
greatly
enlarged
the
dominion
of
the
church
and
power
of
the
priesthood
he
forced
christianity
upon
the
saxons
at
immense
sacrifice
of
life
added
to
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
clergy
by
tithe
lands
recognized
their
judicial
and
canonical
authority
made
marriage
illegal
without
priestly
sanction
and
still
further
degraded
womanhood
through
his
own
polygamy
although
himself
of
such
wanton
life
he
yet
caused
a
woman
of
the
town
to
be
dragged
naked
through
the
city
streets
subject
to
all
the
cruel
tortures
of
an
accompanying
mob
in
the
ninth
century
the
power
of
the
pope
was
again
greatly
increased
up
to
this
period
he
had
been
elected
by
the
clergy
and
people
of
rome
and
the
approbation
of
the
emperor
was
necessary
to
confirm
it
but
charles
the
bald
relinquished
all
right
of
jurisdiction
over
rome
and
thereafter
the
roman
pontiff
became
an
acknowledged
if
not
sometimes
a
supreme
power
in
the
appointment
of
temporal
princes
the
power
of
bishops
clergy
and
cardinals
diminished
as
that
of
the
pope
increased
notwithstanding
her
claims
of
power
through
peter
it
has
been
by
gradual
steps
that
rome
has
decided
upon
her
policy
and
established
her
dogmas
it
is
but
little
over
four
decades
at
the
ecumenical
of
that
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
virgin
mary
was
first
authoritatively
promulgated
although
her
worship
had
long
existed
being
traceable
to
the
egyptian
doctrine
of
the
trinity
with
the
substitution
of
mary
in
place
of
isis
it
was
not
until
that
hildebrand
pope
gregory
vii
declared
matrimony
a
sacrament
of
the
church
and
not
until
at
the
council
of
trent
that
extreme
unction
was
instituted
and
defined
as
a
sacrament
each
of
these
dogmas
threw
more
power
into
the
hands
of
the
church
and
greater
wealth
into
her
coffers
thus
we
see
the
degeneration
of
christianity
has
had
its
epochs
one
occurred
when
the
council
of
nice
allowed
chance
to
dictate
which
would
be
considered
the
canonical
books
of
the
new
testament
accepting
some
theretofore
regarded
as
of
doubtful
authenticity
and
rejecting
others
that
had
been
universally
conceded
genuine
another
epoch
of
degeneration
occurs
when
the
state
in
the
person
of
the
great
emperor
charlemagne
added
to
the
power
of
the
church
by
the
establishment
of
torture
whose
extremest
use
fell
upon
that
portion
of
humanity
looked
upon
as
the
direct
embodiment
of
evil
the
peculiar
character
attributed
to
woman
by
the
church
led
to
the
adoption
of
torture
as
a
necessary
method
of
forcing
her
to
speak
the
truth
the
testimony
of
two
and
in
some
countries
three
women
being
held
as
only
equal
to
that
of
one
man
at
first
young
children
and
women
expecting
motherhood
were
exempted
but
afterwards
neither
age
or
condition
freed
from
accusation
and
torture
and
women
even
in
the
pangs
of
maternity
were
burned
at
the
stake
christianity
in
this
respect
showing
much
more
barbarity
than
pagan
nations
in
pagan
rome
the
expectant
mother
was
held
sacred
to
vex
or
disturb
her
mind
was
punishable
to
strike
her
was
death
she
even
possessed
a
right
pertaining
to
the
vestal
virgins
if
meeting
a
condemned
criminal
on
his
way
to
execution
her
word
sufficed
for
his
pardon
it
scarcely
seems
possible
yet
in
some
christian
countries
the
most
prominent
class
subjected
to
the
torture
were
women
expecting
motherhood
christianity
became
the
religion
of
iceland
and
by
the
earliest
extant
law
the
gragas
dating
to
we
find
that
while
torture
was
prescribed
in
but
few
instances
yet
the
class
principally
subjected
to
it
were
women
about
to
become
mothers
but
generally
throughout
europe
until
about
the
xiv
century
when
priestly
celibacy
had
become
firmly
established
and
the
inquisition
connected
with
the
state
a
class
consisting
of
nobles
doctors
of
the
law
pregnant
women
and
children
under
fourteen
were
exempt
from
torture
except
in
case
of
high
treason
and
a
few
other
offenses
but
at
a
later
period
when
these
institutions
had
greatly
increased
the
irresponsible
power
of
the
church
we
find
neither
sex
condition
nor
age
free
from
its
infliction
both
state
and
church
uniting
in
its
use
in
venetian
folk
lore
it
is
stated
that
satan
once
became
furious
with
the
lord
because
paradise
contained
more
souls
than
hell
and
he
determined
by
fine
promises
to
seduce
human
beings
to
his
worship
and
thus
fill
his
kingdom
he
decided
to
always
tempt
women
instead
of
men
because
through
ambition
or
a
desire
for
revenge
they
yield
more
easily
this
legend
recalls
the
biblical
story
of
satan
taunting
the
lord
with
the
selfish
nature
of
job
s
goodness
and
receiving
from
god
the
permission
to
try
him
witchcraft
was
regarded
as
a
sin
almost
confined
to
women
the
witch
hammer
declared
the
very
word
meant
one
wanting
in
faith
a
wizard
was
rare
one
writer
declaring
that
to
every
hundred
witches
but
one
wizard
was
found
in
time
of
louis
xv
this
difference
was
greatly
increased
to
one
wizard
witches
another
writer
asserted
there
were
witches
in
france
alone
the
great
inquisitor
sprenger
author
of
the
witch
hammer
and
through
whose
instrumentality
many
countries
were
filled
with
victims
largely
promoted
this
belief
heresy
of
witches
not
of
wizards
must
we
call
it
for
these
latter
are
of
very
small
no
class
or
condition
of
women
escaped
him
we
read
of
young
children
old
people
infants
witches
of
fifteen
years
and
two
infernally
beautiful
of
seventeen
years
although
the
ordeal
of
the
red
hot
iron
fell
into
disuse
in
the
secular
courts
early
in
the
fourteenth
century
ecclesiasticism
preserved
it
in
case
of
women
accused
of
witchcraft
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
longer
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
witchcraft
accusations
was
that
protestations
of
innocence
and
a
submission
to
ordeals
such
as
had
always
vindicated
those
taking
part
in
them
if
passing
through
unharmed
did
not
clear
a
woman
charged
with
witchcraft
who
was
then
accused
with
having
received
direct
help
from
satan
the
maxim
of
secular
law
that
the
torture
which
did
not
produce
confession
entitled
the
accused
to
full
acquittal
was
not
in
force
under
ecclesiastical
indictments
and
the
person
accused
of
witchcraft
was
always
liable
to
be
tried
again
for
the
same
crime
every
safeguard
of
law
was
violated
in
case
of
woman
even
magna

forbidding
appeal
to
her
except
in
case
of
her
husband
before
the
introduction
of
christianity
no
capital
punishment
existed
in
the
modern
acceptation
of
the
term
except
for
witchcraft
but
pagans
unlike
christians
did
not
look
upon
women
as
more
given
to
this
practice
than
men
witches
and
wizards
were
alike
stoned
to
death
but
as
soon
as
a
system
of
religion
was
adopted
which
taught
the
greater
sinfulness
of
women
over
whom
authority
had
been
given
to
man
by
god
himself
the
saying
arose
one
wizard
to
witches
and
the
persecution
for
witchcraft
became
chiefly
directed
against
women
the
church
degraded
woman
by
destroying
her
and
teaching
her
to
feel
consciousness
of
guilt
in
the
very
fact
of
her
existence
the
extreme
wickedness
of
woman
taught
as
a
cardinal
doctrine
of
the
church
created
the
belief
that
she
was
desirous
of
destroying
all
religion
witchcraft
being
regarded
as
her
strongest
weapon
therefore
no
punishment
for
it
was
thought
too
severe
the
teaching
of
the
church
as
to
the
creation
of
women
and
the
origin
of
evil
embodied
the
ordinary
belief
of
the
christian
peoples
and
that
woman
rather
than
man
practiced
this
sin
was
attributed
by
the
church
to
her
original
sinful
nature
which
led
her
to
disobey
god
s
first
command
in
eden
although
witchcraft
was
treated
as
a
crime
against
the
state
it
was
regarded
as
a
greater
sin
against
heaven
the
bible
having
set
its
seal
of
disapproval
in
the
injunction
thou
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
the
church
therefore
claimed
its
control
when
coming
under
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
witchcraft
was
much
more
strenuously
dealt
with
than
when
it
fell
under
lay
tribunals
it
soon
proved
a
great
source
of
emolument
to
the
church
which
grew
enormously
rich
by
its
confiscation
to
its
own
use
of
all
property
of
the
condemned
sprenger
whose
work
the
witch
hammer
was
devoted
to
methods
of
dealing
with
this
sin
was
printed
in
size
convenient
for
carrying
in
the
pocket
it
based
its
authority
upon
the
bible
pages
being
devoted
to
proving
that
women
were
especially
addicted
to
sorcery
this
work
was
sanctioned
by
the
pope
but
after
the
reformation
became
equally
authoritative
in
protestant
as
in
catholic
countries
not
losing
its
power
for
evil
until
the
xviii
century
a
body
of
men
known
as
traveling
witch
inquisitors
of
whom
sprenger
was
chief
journeyed
from
country
to
country
throughout
christendom
in
search
of
victims
for
torture
and
death
their
entrance
into
a
country
or
city
was
regarded
with
more
fear
than
famine
or
pestilence
especially
by
women
against
whom
their
malignity
was
chiefly
directed
sprenger
the
great
authority
declaring
that
her
name
signified
evil
the
very
word
woman
meaning
one
wanting
in
faith
for
means
faith
and
the
reformation
caused
no
diminution
in
its
use
the
protestant
clergy
equally
with
the
catholic
constantly
appealing
to
its
pages
still
another
class
known
as
witch
finders
or
witch
persecutors

their
work

their

and
invent
a
thousand
stories

the
love
of

and
the
love

formed
a
most
hideous
combination
for
evil
in

was
full
of
the
horrors
of

persecutions

for
a

in

which
grew
in
their
imagination
from
a
false
belief
in

extraordinary
wickedness
based
upon
a
false
theory
as
to
original
sin
remy

acknowledged
to
having
burnt
eight
hundred
in
sixteen
years
at
the
rate
of
half
a

a

many

were
driven
to
suicide
in

torture
in

of

nine

in
a

five
hundred
were
executed
at

in
a
single
month
while
written
history
does
not
fail
to
give
abundant
record
in
regard
to
the
number
of
such
victims
of
the
church
largely
women
whose
lives
were
forfeited
by
accusation
of
witchcraft
hundreds
at
one
time
dying
agonizingly
by
fire
a
new
and
weird
evidence
as
to
the
innumerable
multitude
of
these
martyrs
was
of
late
most
unexpectedly
brought
to
light
in
spain
during
a
course
of
leveling
and
excavations
for
city
improvements
in
madrid
recently
the
workmen
came
upon
the
de
la
the
cutting
of
a
new
road
through
that
part
of
the
city
laid
bare
like
geological
strata
long
black
layers
one
above
the
other
at
distances
of
one
or
two
feet
in
the
sandstone
and
clay
some
of
these
layers
extended
feet
in
a
horizontal
direction
and
were
at
first
supposed
to
be
the
actual
discovery
of
new
geological
strata
which
they
closely
resembled
they
proved
to
be
the
remains
of
inquisitorial
burnings
where
thousands
of
human
beings
of
all
ages
had
perished
by
the
torture
of
fire
the
layers
consisted
of
coal
coagulated
with
human
fat
bones
the
remains
of
singed
hair
and
the
shreds
of
burnt
garments
this
discovery
created
great
excitement
people
visiting
the
spot
by
thousands
to
satisfy
themselves
of
the
fact
and
to
carry
away
some
memento
of
that
dark
age
of
christian
cruelty
a
cruelty
largely
exercised
against
the
most
helpless
and
innocent
a
cruelty
having
no
parallel
in
the
annals
of
paganism
imagination
fails
to
conceive
the
condensed
torture
this
spot
of
earth
knew
under
the
watchword
of
christ
and
his
cross
and
that
was
but
one
of
the
hundreds
nay
thousands
of
similar
burning
places
of
the
cross
with
which
every
christian
country
city
and
town
was
provided
for
many
hundreds
of
years
a
most
diabolical
custom
of
the
church
made
these
burnings
a
holiday
spectacle
people
thus
grew
to
look
unmoved
upon
the
most
atrocious
tortures
and
excited
crowds
hung
about
witch
burnings
eagerly
listening
as
the
priests
exhorted
to
confession
or
tormented
the
dying
victims
with
pictures
of
an
unending
fire
soon
to
be
their
fate
an
accusation
of
witchcraft
struck
all
relatives
of
the
accused
with
terror
destroying
the
ordinary
virtues
of
humanity
in
the
hearts
of
nearest
friends
as
it
was
maintained
that
devils
possessed
more
than
one
in
a
family
each
member
sought
safety
by
aiding
the
church
in
accumulating
proof
against
the
accused
in
hopes
thereby
to
escape
similar
charge
it
is
impossible
for
us
at
the
present
day
to
conceive
the
awful
horror
falling
upon
a
family
into
which
an
accusation
of
witchcraft
had
come
not
alone
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
such
a
charge
the
terrors
of
a
violent
death
under
the
most
painful
form
the
sudden
hurling
of
the
family
from
ease
and
affluence
to
the
most
abject
poverty
but
above
all
the
belief
that
unending
torment
by
fire
pursued
the
lost
soul
through
eternity
made
a
combination
of
terrors
appalling
to
the
stoutest
heart
a
scotch
woman
convicted
as
a
witch
and
sentenced
to
be
burned
alive
could
not
be
persuaded
by
either
priest
or
sheriff
to
admit
her
guilt
suffering
the
intensest
agonies
of
thirst
during
her
torture
she
espied
her
only
son
in
the
surrounding
crowd
imploring
him
in
the
name
of
her
love
for
him
she
begged
as
her
last
request
that
he
should
bring
her
a
drink
he
shook
his
head
not
speaking
her
fortitude
her
love
his
own
most
certain
conviction
of
her
innocence
not
touching
him
when
she
cried
again
oh
my
dear
son
help
me
any
drink
be
it
never
so
little
for
i
am
most
extremely
drie
oh
drie
his
answer
to
her
agonizing
entreaties
could
not
be
credited
were
it
not
a
subject
of
history
and
the
date
so
recent
by
no
means
dear
mother
will
i
do
you
the
wrong
for
the
drier
you
are
no
doubt
you
will
burn
the
under
accadian
law
years
before
christianity
the
son
who
denied
his
father
was
sentenced
to
a
simple
fine
but
he
who
denied
his
mother
was
to
be
banished
from
the
land
and
sea
but
in
the
sixteenth
century
of
the
christian
era
we
find
a
son
under
christian
laws
denying
his
mother
a
drink
of
water
in
her
death
agony
by
fire
erskine
says
it
was
instituted
in
scotland
that
all
who
used
witchcraft
sorcery
necromancy
or
pretended
skill
therein
shall
be
punished
capitally
upon
which
statute
numberless
innocent
persons
were
tried
and
burnt
to
death
upon
evidence
which
in
place
of
affording
reasonable
conviction
to
the
judge
was
fraught
with
absurdity
and
thirty
thousand
persons
accused
of
witchcraft
were
burned
to
death
in
germany
and
italy
alone
and
although
neither
age
nor
sex
was
spared
yet
women
and
girls
were
the
chief
victims
uncommon
beauty
was
as
dangerous
to
a
woman
as
the
possession
of
great
wealth
which
brought
frequent
accusations
in
order
that
the
church
might
seize
upon
the
witches
property
for
its
own
use
children
of
the
most
tender
years
did
not
escape
accusation
and
death
during
the
height
of
witchcraft
persecution
hundreds
of
little
ones
were
condemned
as
witches
little
girls
of
ten
eight
and
seven
years
are
mentioned
blind
girls
infants
and
even
young
boys
were
among
the
numbers
who
thus
perished
everywhere
the
most
helpless
classes
were
the
victims
it
was
declared
that
witches
looked
no
person
steadily
in
the
face
but
allowed
their
eyes
to
wander
from
side
to
side
or
kept
them
fixed
upon
the
earth
to
this
assertion
that
a
witch
could
not
look
any
one
in
the
face
the
present
belief
of
a
connection
between
guilt
and
a
downcast
look
is
due
although
the
church
taught
that
a
woman
should
preserve
a
downward
look
in
shame
for
the
sin
she
had
brought
into
the
world
and
to
this
day
an
open
confident
look
upon
a
woman
s
face
is
deprecated
as
evil
attendance
upon
sabbats
and
control
of
the
weather
were
among
the
accusations
brought
against
the
witch
in
scotland
a
woman
accused
of
raising
a
storm
by
taking
off
her
stockings
was
put
to
death
sprenger
tells
of
a
swiss
farmer
whose
little
daughter
startled
him
by
saying
she
could
bring
rain
immediately
raising
a
storm
whatever
the
pretext
made
for
witchcraft
persecution
we
have
abundant
proof
that
the
witch
was
among
the
most
profoundly
scientific
persons
of
the
age
the
church
having
forbidden
its
offices
and
all
external
methods
of
knowledge
to
woman
was
profoundly
stirred
with
indignation
at
her
having
through
her
own
wisdom
penetrated
into
some
of
the
most
deeply
subtle
secrets
of
nature
and
it
was
a
subject
of
debate
during
the
middle
ages
if
learning
for
woman
was
not
an
additional
capacity
for
evil
as
owing
to
her
knowledge
had
first
been
introduced
in
the
world
in
penetrating
into
these
arcana
woman
trenched
upon
that
mysterious
hidden
knowledge
of
the
church
which
it
regarded
as
among
its
most
potential
methods
of
controlling
mankind
scholars
have
invariably
attributed
magical
knowledge
and
practices
to
the
church
popes
and
prelates
of
every
degree
having
been
thus
accused
the
word
magic
or
wisdom
simply
meaning
superior
science
was
attributed
in
the
highest
degree
to
king
solomon
who
ruled
even
the
elementals
by
means
of
his
magic
ring
made
in
accord
with
certain
natural
laws
he
was
said
to
have
drawn
his
power
directly
from
god
magi
were
known
as
late
as
the
x
century
of
this
era
among
their
powers
were
casting
out
demons
the
fearless
use
of
poisons
control
of
spirits
and
an
acquaintance
with
many
natural
laws
unknown
to
the
world
at
large
during
the
present
century
the
abbé
constant
eliphas
levi
declared
the
pentegram
to
be
the
key
of
the
two
worlds
and
if
rightly
understood
endowing
man
with
infinite
power
the
empire
of
the
will
over
the
astral
light
is
symbolized
in
magic
by
the
pentegram
the
growth
of
a
personal
will
being
the
most
important
end
to
be
attained
in
the
history
of
man
s
evolution
the
opposition
of
the
church
to
this
growth
of
the
human
will
in
mankind
has
ever
been
the
most
marked
feature
in
its
history
under
will
man
decides
for
himself
escaping
from
all
control
that
hinders
his
personal
development
it
is
only
an
innate
and
natural
tendency
of
the
soul
to
go
beyond
its
body
to
find
material
with
which
to
clothe
the
life
that
it
desires
to
give
expression
to
the
soul
can
and
must
be
trained
to
do
this
consciously
you
can
easily
see
that
this
power
possessed
will
give
its
possessor
power
to
work
magic
ignorance
and
the
anathemas
of
the
church
against
knowledge
to
be
gained
through
an
investigation
of
the
more
abstruse
laws
of
nature
have
invested
the
word
magic
with
terror
but
magic
simply
means
knowledge
of
the
effect
of
certain
natural
but
generally
unknown
laws
the
secret
operation
of
natural
causes
according
to
bacon
and
other
philosophers
consequences
resulting
from
control
of
the
invisible
powers
of
nature
such
as
are
shown
in
the
electrical
appliances
of
the
day
which
a
few
centuries
since
would
have
been
termed
witchcraft
seeking
to
compel
the
aid
of
spirits
was
understood
as
magic
at
an
early
day
lenormant
says
the
object
of
magic
in
chaldea
was
to
conjure
the
spirits
giving
minute
description
of
the
ancient
formula
scientific
knowledge
in
the
hands
of
the
church
alone
was
a
great
element
of
spiritual
and
temporal
power
aiding
it
in
more
fully
subduing
the
human
will
the
testimony
of
the
ages
entirely
destroys
the
assertion
sometimes
made
that
witchcraft
was
merely
a
species
of
hysteria
every
discovery
of
science
is
a
nearer
step
towards
knowledge
of
the
laws
governing
the
accursed
sciences
as
everything
connected
with
psychic
power
in
possession
of
the
laity
was
termed
by
the
church
her
seven
evidences
for
possession
included
nearly
all
forms
of
mesmerism
all
modern
investigations
tend
to
prove
what
was
called
witchcraft
to
have
been
in
most
instances
the
action
of
psychic
laws
not
yet
fully
understood
an
extremely
suggestive
article
appeared
in
the
january
and
february
numbers
of
by
bjerregaard
entitled
the
elementals
and
the
elementary
in
it
bjerregaard
referred
to
the
pacinian
corpuscles
the
discovery
of
an
italian
physician
in
and
he
said
pacini
found
in
all
the
sensible
nerves
of
the
fingers
many
elliptical
whitish
corpuscles
he
compared
them
to
the
electrical
organs
of
the
torpedo
and
described
them
as
animal
or
organs
of
animal
magnetism
and
so
did
henle
and
holliker
two
german
anatomists
who
have
studied
and
described
these
corpuscles
very
minutely
in
the
human
body
they
are
found
in
great
numbers
in
connection
with
the
nerves
of
the
hand
also
in
those
of
the
foot
the
ecstatic
dances
of
the
enthusiasts
and
the
of
somnambulists
in
water
or
their
ability
to
use
the
soles
of
their
feet
as
organs
of
perception
and
the
ancient
art
of
healing
by
the
soles
of
the
these
facts
explain
the
mystery
they
are
found
sparingly
on
the
spinal
nerves
and
on
the
plexuses
of
the
sympathetic
but
never
on
the
nerves
of
motion
anatomists
are
interested
in
these
pacinian
corpuscles
because
of
the
novel
aspect
in
which
they
present
the
constituent
parts
of
the
placed
in
the
heart
of
a
system
of
concentric
membranous
capsules

to

somewhat
famous
in

let
me
state
that
in
the
mesentery
of
the
cat
they
can
be
seen
in
large
numbers
with
the
naked
eye

small
grains
a
little

a

have
been
found
in
the
ox
symbol
of
the
priestly
office
but
they
are
wanting
in
all
birds
amphibia
and
fishes
magic
whether
brought
about
by
the
aid
of
spirits
or
simply
through
an
understanding
of
secret
natural
laws
is
of
two
kinds
white
and
black
according
as
its
intent
and
consequences
are
evil
or
good
and
in
this
respect
does
not
differ
from
the
use
made
of
the
well
known
laws
of
nature
which
are
ever
of
good
or
evil
character
in
the
hands
of
good
or
evil
persons
to
the
church
in
its
powerful
control
of
the
human
will
must
be
attributed
the
use
of
black
magic
in
its
most
injurious
form
proof
that
knowledge
of
the
mysterious
laws
governing
ordinary
natural
phenomena
still
exists
even
among
civilized
people
is
indubitable
our
american
indians
in
various
portions
of
the
continent
according
to
authorities
also
possess
power
to
produce
storms
of
thunder
lightning
and
rain
a
vast
amount
of
evidence
exists
to
show
that
the
word
witch
formerly
signified
a
woman
of
superior
knowledge
many
of
the
persons
called
witches
doubtless
possessed
a
of
the
pacinian
corpuscles
in
hands
and
feet
enabling
them
to
swim
when
cast
into
water
bound
to
rise
in
the
air
against
the
ordinary
action
of
gravity
to
heal
by
a
touch
and
in
some
instances
to
sink
into
a
condition
of
catalepsy
perfectly
unconscious
of
torture
when
applied
many
were
doubtless
psychic
sensitives
of
high
powers
similar
perhaps
to
the
seeress
of
prevorst
whose
peculiar
characteristics
were
the
subject
of
investigation
by
kerner
about
the
end
of
the
witch
period
his
report
forming
one
of
the
most
mysteriously
interesting
portions
of
psychic
literature
the
seeress
was
able
to
perceive
the
hidden
principles
of
all
vegetable
or
mineral
substances
whether
beneficial
or
injurious
kerner
stated
that
her
magnetic
condition
might
be
divided
into
four
degrees
first
that
in
which
she
ordinarily
was
when
she
appeared
to
be
awakened
but
on
the
contrary
was
the
first
stage
of
her
inner
life
many
persons
of
whom
it
was
not
expected
and
who
was
not
aware
of
it
themselves
being
in
this
state
second
the
magnetic
dream
which
she
believed
to
be
the
condition
of
many
persons
who
were
regarded
as
insane
third
the
half
wakening
state
when
she
spoke
and
wrote
the
inner
language
her
spirit
then
being
in
intimate
conjunction
with
her
soul
fourth
her
clairvoyant
state
with
the
investigation
of
kerner
the
discoveries
of
galvani
pacini
and
those
more
recently
connected
with
electricity
notably
of
edison
and
nikolas
tesla
the
world
seems
upon
the
eve
of
important
knowledge
which
may
throw
full
light
upon
the
peculiar
nerve
action
of
the
witch
period
when
a
holocaust
of
women
were
sacrificed
victims
of
the
ignorance
and
barbarity
of
the
church
which
thus
retarded
civilization
and
delayed
spiritual
progress
for
many
hundred
years
besides
the
natural
psychics
who
formed
a
large
proportion
of
the
victims
of
this
period
other
women
with
a
natural
spirit
of
investigation
made
scientific
discoveries
with
equally
baleful
effect
upon
themselves
the
one
fact
of
a
woman
s
possessing
knowledge
serving
to
bring
her
under
the
suspicion
and
accusation
of
the
church
henry
more
a
learned
cambridge
graduate
of
the
seventeenth
century
wrote
a
treatise
on
witchcraft
explanatory
of
the
term
witch
which
he
affirmed
simply
signified
a
wise
or
learned
woman
it
meant
uncommon
but
not
unlawful
knowledge
or
skill
it
will
assist
in
forming
an
opinion
to
know
that
the
word
witch
is
from
to
prophesy
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
psychic
powers
of
many
such
persons
the
modern
slavonian
or
russian
name
for
witch
is
from
the
verb
to
know
signifying
much
the
same
as
veda
muller
says
means
the
same
as
the
wise
the
sanskrit
word
answers
to
the
german
which
literally
means
we
a
russian
name
for
the
witch
is
derived
from
the
verb
to
know
a
curious
account
of
modern
russian
belief
in
witchcraft
is
to
be
found
in
madame
blavatsky
s
the
german
word
that
is
witch
primarily
signified
priestess
a
wise
or
superior
woman
who
in
a
sylvan
temple
worshiped
those
gods
and
goddesses
that
together
governed
earth
and
heaven
not
alone
but
with
thousands
of
the
people
for
whom
she
officiated
she
was
found
there
especially
upon
walpurgis
night
the
chief
hexen
witch
sabbat
of
the
north
a
german
scholar
furnished
this
explanation
the
german
word
heke
witch
is
a
compound
word
from
hag
and
idisan
or
hag
means
a
beautiful
landscape
woodland
meadow
field
altogether
idisen
means
female
deities
or
walpurgis
night
is
may
twelfth
perfume
and
the
old
by
the
priests
it
is
a
remnant
of
the
great
gathering
to
worship
the
old
deities
when
christianity
had
overshadowed
them
a
monument
of
the
wedding
of
woden
or
odin
with
and
earth
at
spring
time
the
saxon
festival
eostre
the
christian
easter
was
celebrated
in
april
each
of
these
festivals
at
a
time
when
winter
having
released
its
sway
smiling
earth
giving
her
life
to
healing
herbs
and
leaves
once
more
welcomed
her
worshipers
in
the
south
of
europe
the
month
of
october
peculiarly
belonged
to
the
witches
the
first
of
may
was
especially
devoted
by
those
elementals
known
as
fairies
whose
special
rites
were
dances
upon
the
green
sward
leaving
curious
mementoes
of
their
visits
in
the
circles
known
as
fairies
in
reality
the
original
meaning
of
witch
was
a
wise
woman
so
also
the
word
means
sage
or
wise
and
a
host
or
congregation
while
and
all
originally
signified
book
was
the
name
of
the
day
when
the
celtic
druids
gave
instruction
and
is
the
origin
of
our
words
sabbath
and
sunday
but
the
degradation
of
learning
its
almost
total
loss
among
christian
nations
an
entire
change
in
the
signification
of
words
owing
to
ignorance
and
superstition
led
to
the
strangest
and
most
infamous
results
the
earliest
doctors
among
the
common
people
of
christian
europe
were
women
who
had
learned
the
virtues
and
use
of
herbs
the
famous
works
of
paracelsus
were
but
compilations
of
the
knowledge
of
these
wise
women
as
he
himself
stated
during
the
feudal
ages
women
were
excellent
surgeons
wounded
warriors
frequently
falling
under
their
care
and
to
the
skill
of
these
women
were
indebted
for
recovery
from
dangerous
wounds
among
the
women
of
savage
races
to
much
greater
extent
than
among
the
men
a
knowledge
of
the
healing
powers
of
plants
and
herbs
is
to
this
day
found
but
while
for
many
hundred
years
the
knowledge
of
medicine
and
its
practice
among
the
poorer
classes
was
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
women
and
many
discoveries
in
science
are
due
to
them
yet
an
acquaintance
of
herbs
soothing
to
pain
or
healing
in
their
qualities
was
then
looked
upon
as
having
been
acquired
through
diabolical
agency
even
those
persons
cured
through
the
instrumentality
of
some
woman
were
ready
when
the
hour
came
to
assert
their
belief
in
her
indebtedness
to
the
devil
for
her
knowledge
not
only
were
the
common
people
themselves
ignorant
of
all
science
but
their
brains
were
filled
with
superstitious
fears
and
the
belief
that
knowledge
had
been
first
introduced
to
the
world
through
woman
s
obedience
to
the
devil
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
church
decreed
that
any
woman
who
healed
others
without
having
duly
studied
was
a
witch
and
should
suffer
death
yet
in
that
same
century
at
basle
paracelsus
threw
all
his
medical
works
including
those
of
hippocrates
and
galen
into
the
fire
saying
that
he
knew
nothing
except
what
he
had
learned
from
witches
as
late
as
the
persecution
of
her
male
compeers
cast
elizabeth
blackwell
an
english
woman
physician
into
prison
for
debt
devoting
herself
even
behind
the
bars
to
her
loved
science
she
prepared
the
first
medical
botany
given
to
the
world
the
modern
discovery
of
anaesthetics
by
means
of
whose
use
human
suffering
can
be
so
greatly
ameliorated
is
justly
claimed
as
the
greatest
boon
that
science
has
conferred
upon
mankind
yet
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
medical
art
of
mitigating
pain
is
but
an
olden
one
rediscovered
methods
of
causing
insensibility
to
pain
were
known
to
the
ancient
world
during
the
middle
ages
these
secrets
were
only
understood
by
the
persecuted
women
doctors
of
that
period
subjected
under
church
rule
to
torture
burning
at
the
stake
or
drowning
as
witches
the
use
of
medicaments
by
women
can
be
traced
back
from
five
hundred
to
a
thousand
years
at
the
time
that
witchcraft
became
the
great
ogre
against
which
the
church
expended
all
its
terrific
powers
women
doctors
employed
anaesthetics
to
mitigate
the
pains
and
perils
of
motherhood
throwing
the
sufferer
into
a
deep
sleep
when
the
child
entered
the
world
they
made
use
of
solanae
especially
belladonna
but
that
woman
should
find
relief
at
this
hour
of
intense
suffering
and
peril
when
a
new
being
entered
the
world
provoked
open
hostility
from
the
church
the
use
of
mitigating
herbs
assailed
that
theory
of
the
church
which
having
placed
the
creation
of
sin
upon
woman
still
further
inculcated
the
doctrine
that
she
must
undergo
continual
penance
the
greatest
suffering
being
a
punishment
in
nowise
equal
to
her
deserts
its
teachings
that
she
had
therefore
been
especially
cursed
by
her
maker
with
suffering
and
sorrow
at
this
period
rendered
the
use
of
mitigating
remedies
during
childbirth
dangerous
alike
to
the
wise
woman
and
the
mother
for
whose
relief
they
were
employed
although
the
present
century
has
shown
similar
opposition
by
the
church
to
the
use
of
anaesthetics
for
women
at
this
time
it
is
almost
impossible
to
depict
the
sentiment
against
such
relief
which
made
the
witchcraft
period
one
of
especial
terror
to
age
that
looked
upon
the
slightest
attempt
at
such
alleviation
as
proof
of
collusion
with
the
devil
so
strong
was
the
power
of
the
church
so
universal
the
belief
in
the
guilt
of
all
women
that
even
those
sufferers
who
had
availed
themselves
of
the
knowledge
of
the
wise
woman
did
so
in
fear
as
calling
in
the
aid
of
evil
and
were
ready
to
testify
against
her
to
whom
they
had
been
indebted
for
alleviation
of
pain
whenever
required
by
the
dread
mandate
of
the
church
a
strong
natural
bias
toward
the
study
of
medicine
together
with
deepest
sympathy
for
suffering
humanity
were
required
in
order
to
sustain
the
wise
woman
amid
the
perils
constantly
surrounding
her
many
such
women
losing
their
lives
as
witches
simply
because
of
their
superior
medical
and
surgical
knowledge
death
by
torture
was
the
method
of
the
church
for
the
repression
of
woman
s
intellect
knowledge
being
held
as
evil
and
dangerous
in
her
hands
ignorance
was
regarded
as
an
especial
virtue
in
woman
and
fear
held
her
in
this
condition
few
women
dared
be
wise
after
thousands
of
their
sex
had
gone
to
death
by
drowning
or
burning
because
of
their
knowledge
the
superior
learning
of
witches
was
recognized
in
the
widely
extended
belief
of
their
ability
to
work
miracles
the
witch
was
in
reality
the
profoundest
thinker
the
most
advanced
scientist
of
those
ages
the
persecution
which
for
ages
waged
against
witches
was
in
reality
an
attack
upon
science
at
the
hands
of
the
church
as
knowledge
has
ever
been
power
the
church
feared
its
use
in
woman
s
hands
and
leveled
its
deadliest
blows
at
her
although
the
church
in
its
myth
of
the
fall
attributes
knowledge
to
woman
s
having
eaten
of
its
tree
yet
while
not
scrupling
to
make
use
of
the
results
of
her
disobedience
for
its
own
benefit
it
has
been
most
earnest
in
its
endeavors
to
prevent
her
from
like
use
no
less
today
than
during
the
darkest
period
of
its
history
is
the
church
the
great
opponent
of
woman
s
education
every
advance
step
for
her
having
found
the
church
antagonistic
every
kind
of
was
brought
into
play
in
these
accusations
of
witchcraft
against
women
physicians
greed
malice
envy
hatred
fear
the
desire
of
clearing
one
s
self
from
suspicion
all
became
motives
male
physicians
not
skillful
enough
to
cure
disease
would
deliberately
swear
that
there
could
be
but
one
reason
for
their
use
of
witchcraft
against
them
as
the
charge
of
witchcraft
not
only
brought
disrepute
but
death
upon
the
wise
woman
at
the
hands
of
the
church
she
was
soon
compelled
to
abandon
both
the
practice
of
medicine
and
surgery
and
for
many
hundred
years
but
few
women
doctors
were
to
be
found
in
christian
countries
it
is
however
a
noticeable
fact
that
madam
la
chapelle
an
eminent
woman
accoucher
of
france
during
the
present
century
and
chaussure
revived
the
use
of
belladonna
during
parturition
thus
acknowledging
the
scientific
acquirements
of
serf
women
and
since
the
of
woman
into
the
medical
profession
within
the
past
few
years
the
world
has
been
indebted
for
a
knowledge
of
the
cause
and
cure
of
certain
forms
of
disease
peculiar
to
woman
to
the
skill
of
those
physicians
of
her
own
sex
whom
the
church
so
long
banished
from
practice
through
its
opposition
to
the
use
of
anaesthetics
by
the
women
physicians
of
the
witch
period
the
church
again
interposed
the
weight
of
her
mighty
arm
to
crush
science
leaving
the
load
of
preventable
suffering
of
all
kinds
upon
the
world
for
many
hundred
years
longer
or
until
the
light
of
a
scientific
civilization
threw
discredit
upon
her
authority
history
proves
that
women
were
the
earliest
chemists
the
witch
period
also
shows
us
the
germs
of
a
medical
system
the
homeopathic
supposed
to
be
of
modern
origin
in
similibus
among
the
strange
epidemics
of
these
ages
a
dancing
mania
appeared
belladonna
among
whose
effects
is
the
desire
of
dancing
was
employed
as
a
cure
of
the
dancing
mania
and
thus
the
theory
of
hahnemann
was
forestalled
during
the
witch
period
these
sages
or
were
believed
to
be
endowed
with
a
supernatural
or
magical
power
of
curing
diseases
they
were
also
regarded
as
prophets
to
whom
the
secrets
of
the
future
were
known
the
women
of
ancient
germany
of
gaul
and
among
the
celts
were
especially
famous
for
their
healing
powers
possessing
knowledge
by
which
wounds
and
diseases
that
baffled
the
most
expert
male
physicians
were
cured
the
women
of
a
still
more
ancient
period
the
fame
of
whose
magical
powers
has
descended
to
the
present
time
circe
medea
and
thracia
were
evidently
physicians
of
the
highest
skill
the
secret
of
compounding
herbs
and
drugs
left
by
circe
to
her
descendants
gave
them
power
over
the
most
poisonous
serpents

among
the
many

and

whose
virtues
were
discovered
by

the

nation
took
its
name
from
the
famous
thracia
whose
medical
skill
and
knowledge
of
herbs
was
so
great
that
the
country
deemed
it
an
honor
to
thus
perpetuate
her
name
aside
from
women
of
superior
intelligence
who
were
almost
invariably
accused
of
witchcraft
the
old
the
insane
the
the
idiotic
also
fell
under
condemnation
the
first
investigation
by
rev
cotton
mather
in
america
resulted
in
the
hanging
of
a
quaker
woman
later
still
an
indian
woman
an
insane
man
and
another
woman
who
was
were
also
accused
under
the
present
theories
regarding
human
rights
it
seems
scarcely
possible
that
less
than
two
hundred
years
ago
such
practices
were
not
only
common
in
england
but
had
also
been
brought
into
america
by
the
puritan
fathers
the
humiliation
and
tortures
of
women
increased
in
proportion
to
the
spread
of
christianity
and
the
broader
area
over
which
man
s
sole
authority
in
church
and
state
was
disseminated
as
the
supreme
extent
of
spiritual
wrong

out
of
the
bondage
of
the

over
free

so
the
extreme
of
physical
wrong
rose
from
the
growth
of
the
inquisitional
or
paternal
spirit
which
assumed
that
one
human
being
possessed
divine
authority
over
another
human
being
paternalism
a
species
of
condensed
patriarchism
runs
through
ecclesiastical
civil
and
common
law
down
to
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
individuality
was
an
uncomprehended
word
many
hundred
crimes
were
punishable
by
death
that
of
pressing
to
death
the
strong
and
hard
pain
was
practiced
upon
both
men
and
women
in
england
for
five
hundred
years
and
brought
by
the
pilgrims
to
new
england
the
culprit
was
placed
in
the
dark
lower
room
of
some
prison
naked
upon
the
bare
ground
without
clothing
or
rushes
underneath
or
to
cover
him
the
legs
and
arms
were
extended
toward
the
four
corners
of
the
room
and
as
great
a
weight
placed
upon
the

of

without

and
this
to

till

or

it
is
computed
from
historical
records
that
nine
millions
of
persons
were
put
to
death
for
witchcraft
after
or
during
a
period
of
three
hundred
years
and
this
estimate
does
not
include
the
vast
number
who
were
sacrificed
in
the
preceding
centuries
upon
the
same
accusation
the
greater
number
of
this
incredible
multitude
were
women
under
catholicism
those
condemned
as
sorcerers
and
witches
as
heretics
were
in
reality
the
most
advanced
thinkers
of
the
christian
ages
under
that
protestant
pope
the
eighth
henry
an
act
of
parliament
condemning
witchcraft
as
felony
was
confirmed
enacted
under
henry
v
it
had
fallen
into
disuse
but
numerous
petitions
setting
forth
that
witches
and
sorcerers
were
wonderful
many
and
his
majesty
s
subjects
persecuted
to
death
by
their
devices
led
to
its
the
methods
used
to
extort
confession
without
which
it
was
impossible
in
many
cases
to
convict
for
witchcraft
led
to
the
grossest
outrages
upon
woman
searching
the
body
of
the
suspected
witch
for
the
marks
of
satan
and
the
practice
of
shaving
the
whole
body
before
applying
torture
were
occasions
of
atrocious
indignities
it
was
asserted
that
all
who
consorted
with
devils
had
some
secret
mark
about
them
in
some
hidden
place
of
their
bodies
as
the
inside
of
the
lip
the
hair
of
the
eyebrows
inside
of
the
thigh
the
hollow
of
the
arm
or
still
more
private
parts
from
whence
satan
drew
nourishment
this
originated
a
class
of
men
known
as
witch
prickers
who
divesting
the
supposed
witch
whether
maid
matron
or
child
of
all
clothing
minutely
examined
all
parts
of
her
body
for
the
devil
s
sign
woe
to
the
woman
possessing
a
mole
or
other
blemish
upon
her
person
it
was
immediately
pointed
to
as
satan
s
seal
and
as
undeniable
proof
of
having
sold
herself
to
the
devil
belief
in
this
sign
existed
among
the
most
educated
persons
albertus
pictus
an
advocate
in
the
parliament
of
paris
declared
he
himself
had
seen
a
woman
with
the
devil
s
mark
on
her
shoulders
carried
off
the
next
day
by
the
devil
many
authors
affirmed
the
trustworthiness
of
it
was
supposed
that
upon
touching
the
place
the
witch
would
be
unable
to
speak
if
under
the
torture
of
having
every
portion
of
her
body
punctured
by
a
sharp
instrument
the
victim
became
no
longer
able
to
cry
out
her
silence
was
an
accepted
proof
of
finding
the
and
her
condemnation
was
equally
certain
so
great
was
the
number
of
accused
that
these
men
found
profitable
employment
the
depth
of
iniquity
to
which
greed
of
money
leads
was
never
more
forcibly
shown
than
during
witchcraft
one
kincaid
a
new
england
witch
pricker
after
stripping
his
victims
of
all
clothing
bound
them
hand
and
foot
then
thrust
pins
into
every
part
of
their
bodies
until
exhausted
and
rendered
speechless
by
the
torture
they
were
unable
to
scream
when
he
would
triumphantly
proclaim
that
he
had
found
the
witch
mark
another
confessed
on
the
gallows
to
which
a
just
fate
finally
condemned
him
that
he
had
illegally
caused
the
death
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
women
whom
he
had
thus
tortured
no
means
were
considered
too
severe
in
order
to
secure
conviction
the
jesuit
del
rio
said
torture
could
scarcely
be
properly
administered
without
more
or
less
dislocation
of
the
joints
and
persons
escaping
conviction
were
frequently
crippled
for
life
the
church
declared
the
female
sex
had
always
been
most
concerned
in
the
crime
of
christian
witchcraft
and
as
it
was
its
aim
to
separate
woman
from
all
connection
with
its
ordinances
it
also
asserted
that
the
priestesses
of
antiquity
held
their
high
places
by
means
of
witchcraft
trials
for
witchcraft
filled
the
coffers
of
the
church
as
whenever
conviction
took
place
the
property
of
the
witch
and
her
family
was
confiscated
to
that
body
the
clergy
fattened
upon
the
torture
and
burning
of
women
books
giving
directions
for
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted
upon
them
bore
the
significant
titles
of
etc
during
the
middle
ages
the
devil
was
a
personal
being
to
the
church
with
power
about
equal
to
that
of
god
his
kingdom
maintaining
its
equilibrium
with
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
of
heaven
by
means
of
three
persons
in
hell
lucifer
beelzebub
and
leviathan
in
this
era
of
christian
the
three
in
hell
equipoised
the
three
in
the
godhead
marriage
with
devils
was
one
of
the
most
ordinary
accusations
in
witch
trials
such
connections
were
sometimes
regarded
with
pride
the
celebrated
marshall
de
bassompierre
boasting
that
the
founder
of
his
family
was
engendered
from
communion
with
a
spirit
it
was
reported
of
the
mother
of
luther
that
she
was
familiar
with
an
incubus
during
this
period
many
nuns
and
married
women
confessed
to
having
been
visited
by
incubi
of
whose
visits
no
spiritual
efforts
could
rid
them
church
history
also
proves
that
young
girls
and
boys
many
under
ten
years
of
age
were
tried
for
intercourse
with
such
spirits
those
infesting
men
were
known
as
succubi
lady
frances
howard
daughter
of
the
earl
of
suffolk
obtained
a
divorce
from
her
husband
because
of
his
connection
with
a
succubus
one
of
the
most
notable
things
connected
with
such
accusation
was
the
frequent
confession
of
its
truthfulness
in
a
great
number
of
witches
and
wizards
were
burned
who
publicly
confessed
to
their
use
of
unguents
to
their
dances
feasts
and
their
consort
with
devils
a
vicar
general
among
the
laodunenses
at
his
death
left
confession
of
his
his
copulation
with
devils
etc
nor
is
the
present
age
free
from
similar
confessions
tales
of
marriage
with
spirits
of
dead
lovers
paying
nightly
visits
to
the
living
incubi
consorting
with
willing
or
unwilling
victims
those
mediaeval
statements
regarding
the
intercourse
of
spirits
of
the
dead
with
the
living
all
the
customs
of
witchcraft
and
sorcery
are
paralleled
in
our
midst
today
and
such
statements
do
not
come
from
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
but
are
made
by
persons
of
intelligence
as
within
their
own
personal
experience
during
the
witchcraft
period
familiarity
of
this
nature
with
incubi
or
succubi
was
punished
with
death
occasionally
a
person
was
found
of
sufficient
saintliness
to
exorcise
them
as
elementals
are
said
to
have
been
exorcised
during
the
last
half
of
the
present
century
devils
were
said
to
be
very
fond
of
women
with
beautiful
hair
and
the
direction
of
paul
in
regard
to
woman
s
keeping
her
head
covered
was
not
always
regarded
as
a
sign
of
inferiority
but
sometimes
believed
to
be
a
precautionary
admonition
intended
for
the
safety
of
christian
women
to
this
day
the
people
of
some
eastern
countries
men
and
women
alike
will
not
expose
the
head
uncovered
because
of
the
danger
of
thus
giving
entrance
to
certain
invisible
beings
of
an
injurious
character
the
persians
in
particular
wearing
a
turban
or
cloth
of
peculiar
appearance
called
mathoomba
confessions
of
magical
and
witchcraft
practices
were
by
no
means
rare
even
among
the
highest
church
dignitaries
who
implicated
themselves
by
such
avowals
it
was
customary
to
attribute
the
practice
of
magic
to
the
most
holy
fathers
of
the
church
the
popes
from
sylvester
ii
to
gregory
vii
were
all
believed
to
have
been
magicians
benedict
ix
was
also
thus
accused
the
difference
between
the
practices
of
men
and
of
women
existed
only
in
name
what
was
termed
magic
among
men
was
called
witchcraft
in
woman
the
one
was
rarely
the
other
invariably
punished
the
practice
of
magic
by
the
holy
fathers
was
in
furtherance
of
private
or
ecclesiastical
advancement
and
therefore
legitimate
in
the
eye
of
the
church
yet
repentance
was
by
no
means
infrequent
of
pope
sylvester
it
is
said
that
convinced
of
his
sinfulness
in
having
practiced
magic
upon
his
he
ordered
his
tongue
to
be
torn
out
and
his
hands
cut
off
because
he
had
sacrificed
to
the
devil
having
learned
the
art
when
bishop
of
rheims
the
significant
question
as
to
whether
magnetism
or
hypnotism
was
not
a
custom
of
the
church
during
the
middle
ages
as
part
of
the
magic
practiced
by
illustrious
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
is
one
of
importance
in
view
of
recent
hypnotic
experiments
the
fact
that
by
means
of
suggestion
the
responsibility
for
crime
and
the
perpetration
of
overt
criminal
acts
can
be
made
to
fall
upon
persons
entirely
innocent
of
criminal
intention
who
at
the
time
are
in
a
condition
of
irresponsibility
while
the
actual
felon
the
person
who
incited
the
act
remains
unknown
and
unsuspected
exceeds
in
malign
power
all
that
christendom
has
taught
regarding
the
evil
one
science
trembles
on
the
verge
of
important
discoveries
which
may
open
the
door
for
a
full
understanding
of
mediaeval
witchcraft
the
scotch
woman
who
asked
if
a
person
could
not
be
a
witch
without
knowing
it
had
intuitive
perception
that
by
the
action
of
one
person
upon
another
consequences
could
be
induced
of
which
the
perpetrator
was
entirely
guiltless
doubtless
the
strange
power
which
certain
persons
are
capable
of
wielding
over
others
at
present
calling
the
attention
of
scientific
investigators
was
very
common
during
the
witchcraft
period
of
this
power
the
church
as
guardian
of
the
esoteric
sciences
was
fully
aware
frequently
making
it
the
method
through
which
envy
greed
and
revenge
satisfied
themselves
while
throwing
the
external
appearance
of
guilt
upon
others
the
most
complete
protection
against
such
powers
strong
will
has
ever
been
the
aim
of
the
church
to
destroy
freedom
of
the
will
has
ever
held
place
in
clerical
denunciation
by
side
of
original
sin
and
punished
as
sorcery
a
reminiscence
of
olden
older
than
the
witchcraft
period
is
found
in
the
masonic
lamentation
over
the
lost
this
lost
word
the
supreme
word
by
whose
use
all
things
can
be
subdued
is
still
the
quest
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
world
and
sorcerers
are
still
mentioned
who
can
not
die
until
a
certain
mysterious
word
is
passed
from
mouth
to
one
of
the
latest
occult
societies
extant
its
membership
widely
extended
claims
its
origin
from
a
mysterious
word
similarly
passed
the
lord
s
prayer
demands
the
making
whole
hallowed
of
the
father
s
name
evidently
in
the
esoteric
sense
referring
to
that
loss
which
dwells
in
the
minds
of
men
through
tradition
a
species
of
unwritten
history
with
the
restoration
of
the
feminine
in
all
its
attributes
to
its
rightful
place
everywhere
in
realms
seen
and
unseen
the
lost
power
will
have
been
restored
the
lost
name
have
been
found
numbers
are
closely
connected
with
names
their
early
knowledge
not
only
having
preceded
letters
but
having
been
of
much
greater
value
although
after
a
time
letters
and
numbers
became
interchangeable
certain
persons
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
occult
subjects
therefore
claim
the
lost
power
to
abide
in
a
number
rather
than
in
a
word
sounds
possessing
great
and
peculiar
influence
in
all
magical
formulas
their
power
largely
depending
upon
inflection
and
tone
or
vibration
color
and
light
are
also
called
in
aid
during
magical
formulas
the
three
most
distinguishing
features
of
the
history
of
witchcraft
were
its
use
for
the
enrichment
of
the
church
for
the
advancement
of
political
schemes
and
for
the
gratification
of
private
malice
among
these
the
most
influential
reason
was
the
emolument
it
brought
to
the
church
although
inquisitors
and
the
clergy
were
the
principal
prosecutors
this
period
gave
opportunity
for
the
gratification
of
private
malice
and
persons
imbued
with
secret
enmity
towards
others
or
who
coveted
their
property
found
ready
occasion
for
the
indulgence
of
that
malice
of
covetousness
while
the
church
always
claimed
it
divided
the
remainder
of
the
accused
s
possessions
between
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
under
these
circumstances
accusation
and
conviction
became
convertible
terms
the
pretense
under
which
the
church
confiscated
to
itself
all
property
of
the
accused
was
in
line
with
its
other
sophistical
teaching
it
declared
that
the
taint
of
witchcraft
hung
to
all
that
had
belonged
to
the
condemned
whose
friends
were
not
safe
with
such
property
in
their
possession
to
make
this
claim
more
effective
it
was
also
asserted
that
the
very
fact
of
one
member
of
a
family
having
fallen
into
the
practice
of
this
sin
was
virtual
proof
that
all
were
likewise
attainted
under
this
allegation
of
the
church
a
protest
against
such
robbery
was
held
as
proof
of
the
witchcraft
in
the
person
so
protesting
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
property
of
the
accused
admission
of
the
crime
was
strenuously
pressed
in
some
countries
the
property
was
not
forfeited
unless
such
confession
took
place
persecution
for
witchcraft
was
if
possible
more
violent
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
than
at
any
previous
date
by
this
period
it
had
been
introduced
into
america
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
puritan
fathers
it
was
no
less
in
calvinistic
scotland
while
it
with
renewed
vigor
in
catholic
countries
in
the
state
of
venice
it
caused
open
rebellion
against
church
authority
the
council
forbidding
the
sentence
of
the
inquisition
to
be
carried
out
while
only
venice
in
the
whole
of
europe
defied
the
church
upon
this
point
emphatically
protesting
against
such
robbery
of
her
citizens
she
ultimately
succeeded
in
establishing
a
treaty
with
the
pope
whereby
the
inheritance
of
the
condemned
was
retained
in
the
family
the
rebellion
of
venice
against
the
church
upon
the
question
of
property
belonging
to
its
subjects
a
question
upon
which
the
state
held
itself
soon
effected
a
radical
change
and
had
remarkable
effect
in
lessening
the
number
of
accusations
in
that
state
theft
by
the
church
in
that
direction
no
longer
possible
accusations
of
witchcraft
soon
ceased
being
no
longer
recognized
as
sin
after
ceasing
to
bring
money
into
the
coffers
of
the
church
it
is
a
fact
noted
by
very
many
authorities
that
when
witchcraft
fell
under
control
of
the
state
its
penalties
were
greatly
lessened
while
accusations
grew
fewer
yet
for
a
period
even
the
civil
power
aided
in
spreading
this
belief
offering
rewards
for
conviction
and
as
the
church
had
grown
immensely
rich
by
means
of
witch
persecution
so
the
state
increased
its
own
power
and
wealth
through
similar
means
the
theory
of
bishop
butler
that
whole
communities
at
times
become
mad
seems
proven
by
the
experience
of
this
period
upon
no
other
ground
but
that
of
universal
insanity
can
excusable
explanation
be
offered
but
for
the
church
no
such
exculpation
is
possible
her
teachings
and
her
acts
having
created
this
wholesale
madness
of
communities
experience
of
her
course
during
preceding
centuries
shows
us
that
the
persecution
of
the
witchcraft
period
was
but
a
continuation
of
her
policy
from
the
moment
of
her
of
universal
dominion
over
the
lives
the
property
and
the
thoughts
of
mankind
neither
rank
nor
learning
age
nor
goodness
freed
a
woman
from
accusation
the
mother
of
the
great
astronomer
kepler
a
woman
of
noble
family
died
in
chains
having
been
accused
of
witchcraft
the
council
of
bourges
tortured
a
reputed
witch
who
was
only
known
for
her
good
works
a
determined
effort
for
the
destruction
of
every
virtue
among
women
seemed
made
at
this
period
in
the
middle
of
the
xiii
century
the
emperor
theodore
lascarius
caused
a
noble
lady
of
his
court
to
be
entirely
stripped
of
her
clothing
and
placed
thus
nude
in
a
sack
with
cats
but
even
this
torture
failed
to
extort
a
confession
from
her
innocent
lips
even
in
america
women
of
the
purest
lives
all
of
whose
years
had
been
given
to
good
works
met
with
death
from
like
accusation
soon
after
the
confirmation
of
celibacy
as
a
dogma
of
the
church
at
the
time
when
the
persecution
for
witchcraft
so
rapidly
increased
which
was
also
the
period
of
the
greatest
oppression
under
peculiar
and
silent
rebellion
against
both
church
and
state
took
place
among
the
peasantry
of
europe
who
assembled
in
the
seclusion
of
night
and
the
forest
their
only
place
of
safety
in
which
to
speak
of
their
wrongs
freedom
for
the
peasant
was
found
only
at
night
known
as
birds
of
the
night
foxes
birds
of
prey
it
was
only
at
night
assemblages
that
they
enjoyed
the
least
happiness
or
freedom
here
with
wives
and
daughters
they
met
to
talk
over
the
gross
outrages
perpetrated
upon
them
out
of
their
foul
wrongs
grew
the
sacrifice
of
the
black
mass
with
women
as
officiating
priestess
in
which
the
rites
of
the
church
were
travestied
in
solemn
mockery
and
defiance
cast
at
that
heaven
which
permitted
the
priest
and
the
lord
alike
to
trample
upon
all
the
sacred
rights
of
womanhood
in
the
name
of
religion
and
law
during
this
mocking
service
a
true
sacrifice
of
wheat
was
offered
to
the
spirit
of
the
earth
who
made
wheat
to
grow
and
loosened
birds
bore
aloft
to
the
god
of
freedom
the
sighs
and
prayers
of
the
serfs
asking
that
their
descendants
might
be
free
we
can
but
regard
this
sacrifice
as
the
most
acceptable
offering
made
in
that
day
of
moral
degradation
a
sacrifice
and
a
prayer
more
holy
than
all
the
ceremonials
of
the
church
this
service
where
woman
by
virtue
of
her
greater
despair
acted
both
as
altar
and
priest
opened
with
the
following
address
and
prayer
i
will
come
before
thine
altar
but
save
me
o
lord
from
the
faithless
and
violent
man
from
the
priest
and
the
baron
from
these
assemblages
known
as
sabbat
or
the
sabbath
from
the
old
pagan
sacrifice
to
bacchus
sabiesa
rose
the
belief
in
the
witches
sabbath
which
for
several
hundred
years
formed
a
source
of
accusation
against
women
sending
tens
of
thousands
to
most
horrible
deaths
the
thirteenth
century
was
about
the
central
period
of
this
rebellion
of
the
serfs
against
god
and
the
church
when
they
drank
each
other
s
blood
as
a
sacrament
while
secretly
speaking
of
their
oppression
the
officiating
priestess
was
usually
about
thirty
years
old
having
experienced
all
the
wrongs
that
woman
suffered
under
church
and
state
she
was
entitled
the
elder
yet
in
defiance
of
that
god
to
whom
the
serfs
under
church
teaching
ascribed
all
their
wrongs
she
was
also
called
the
devil
s
this
period
was
especially
that
of
woman
s
rebellion
against
the
existing
order
of
religion
and
government
in
both
church
and
state
while
man
was
connected
with
her
in
these
ceremonies
as
father
husband
brother
yet
all
accounts
show
that
to
woman
as
the
most
deeply
wronged
was
accorded
all
authority
without
her
no
man
was
admitted
to
this
celebration
which
took
place
in
the
seclusion
of
the
forest
and
under
the
utmost
secrecy
offerings
were
made
to
the
latest
dead
and
the
most
newly
born
of
the
district
and
defiance
hurled
against
that
god
to
whose
injustice
the
church
had
taught
woman
that
all
her
wrongs
were
due
women
s
knowledge
of
herbs
was
made
use
of
in
a
preparation
of
solanae
which
mixed
with
mead
beer
cider
or
strong
drink
of
the
the
oppressed
serfs
to
joyous
dancing
and
partial
forgetfulness
of
their
wrongs
during
these
popular
night
gatherings
of
the
sabbath
it
became
the
comforter
throwing
the
friendly
mantle
of
partial
oblivion
over
the
mental
suffering
of
him
who
had
been
so
wronged
as
it
had
done
for
the
mother
s
physical
pain
the
sabbath
was
evidently
the
secret
protest
of
men
and
women
whom
church
and
state
in
combination
had
utterly
oppressed
and
degraded
for
centuries
there
seemed
no
hope
for
this
class
of
this
degraded
portion
of
even
then
women
held
position
of
superiority
in
these
night
assemblages
among
the
papers
of
the
bastile
a
more
extended
account
of
woman
officiating
as
her
own
altar
is
to
be
found
the
injustice
of
man
towards
woman
under
the
laws
of
both
church
and
state
engrafted
upon
society
have
resulted
in
many
evils
unsuspected
by
the
world
which
if
known
would
strike
it
with
amazement
and
terror
even
louis
lingg
one
of
the
condemned
chicago
anarchists
young
handsome
of
vigorous
intellect
who
uncomplainingly
accepted
for
himself
that
death
he
had
decreed
to
the
representatives
to
law
even
he
who
neither
asked
mercy
nor
accepted
the
death
decreed
him
was
the
outgrowth
of
woman
s
wrongs
his
mother
with
whom
his
fate
was
thrown
a
woman
of
the
people
in
hungary
belonging
to
a
powerless
class
crushed
for
centuries
the
plaything
of
those
above
them
father
a
representative
of
the
aristocracy
descended
from
a
long
line
of
military
ancestors
leaving
him
as
the
church
had
taught
him
to
the
sole
care
of
the
mother
he
had
betrayed
it
was
impossible
for
this
boy
not
to
find
in
his
breast
a
turmoil
of
conflicting
emotions
but
above
all
ruling
all
a
hatred
of
entrenched
oppression
nor
did
his
father
s
military
blood
fail
to
play
its
part
leading
to
the
final
result
which
affrighted
a
city
and
closed
his
young
life
in
looking
at
the
history
of
witchcraft
we
see
three
striking
points
for
consideration
first
that
women
were
chiefly
accused
second
that
men
believing
in
woman
s
inherent
wickedness
and
understanding
neither
the
mental
nor
the
physical
peculiarities
of
her
being
ascribed
all
her
idiosyncrasies
to
witchcraft
third
that
the
clergy
inculcated
the
idea
that
woman
was
in
league
with
the
devil
and
that
strong
intellect
remarkable
beauty
or
unusual
sickness
were
in
themselves
proof
of
this
league
catholics
and
protestants
yet
agree
in
holding
women
as
the
chief
accessory
of
the
devil
the
belief
in
witches
indeed
seemed
intensified
after
the
reformation
luther
said
i
would
have
no
compassion
for
a
witch
i
would
burn
them
he
looked
upon
those
who
were
afflicted
with
blindness
lameness
or
idiocy
from
birth
as
possessed
of
demons
and
there
is
record
of
his
attempt
to
drown
an
afflicted
child
in
whom
he
declared
no
soul
existed
its
body
being
animated
by
the
devil
alone
but
a
magistrate
more
enlightened
or
more
humane
than
the
great
reformer
interfered
to
save
the
child
s
life
were
luther
on
earth
again
today
with
the
sentiments
of
his
lifetime
he
would
regard
the
whole
community
as
mad
asylums
for
the
blind
the
dumb
and
idiots
curative
treatment
for
cripples
and
all
persons
naturally
deformed
would
be
to
him
a
direct
intervention
with
the
ways
of
providence
the
belief
of
this
great
reformer
proves
the
folly
of
considering
a
man
wise
because
he
is
pious
religion
and
humanity
were
as
far
apart
with
him
after
the
reformation
as
while
he
was
yet
a
monk
the
fruits
of
monasticism
continued
their
effects
and
his
latter
life
showed
slight
intellectual
or
spiritual
advancement
as
late
as
john
wesley
declared
the
giving
up
of
witchcraft
to
be
in
effect
giving
up
the
bible
such
was
his
low
estimate
of
woman
that
he
regarded
his
own
wife
as
too
sinful
to
conduct
family
prayers
although
to
susannah
equally
with
john
is
methodism
indebted
for
its
existence
in
great
britain
the
rapid
increase
of
belief
in
witchcraft
after
the
reformation
was
especially
noticeable
the
act
of
parliament
which
declared
witchcraft
to
be
felony
confirmed
under
henry
viii
was
again
confirmed
under
elizabeth
in
england
the
reformation
brought
with
it
great
increase
of
tyranny
both
civil
and
ecclesiastical
under
henry
viii
many
new
treasons
were
created
this
king
who
sent
the
largest
proportion
of
his
six
wives
to
the
headsman
s
block
who
neither
hesitated
at
incest
or
at
casting
the
taint
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
daughter
who
succeeded
him
upon
the
throne
could
not
be
expected
to
show
justice
or
mercy
to
subject
women
the
penal
laws
of
even
celibate
elizabeth
were
largely
the
result
of
the
change
in
religion
of
the
realm
the
queen
absolute
in
church
as
in
state
who
bent
priest
and
prelate
to
her
fiery
will
caused
the
laws
to
bear
with
equal
severity
upon
protestant
and
catholic
under
her
a
statute
of
uniformity
for
abolishing
diversity
of
opinions
was
enacted
and
the
clergy
were
continued
in
the
enjoyment
of
secular
power
women
received
no
favor
the
restrictions
of
the
catholic
church
in
regard
to
the
residence
of
a
priest
s
mother
or
sister
in
his
house
were
now
extended
to
the
laity
no
man
was
permitted
to
give
his
widowed
mother
or
orphan
sister
a
home
in
his
house
without
permission
from
the
authorities
and
then
but
for
a
limited
time
single
women
were
allowed
no
control
over
their
own
actions
twelve
years
was
the
legal
marriageable
age
for
a
girl
after
which
period
if
still
unmarried
she
could
be
bound
out
at
the
option
of
the
court
nor
did
the
cromwellian
period
lessen
woman
s
persecution
the
number
of
witches
executed
under
the
presbyterian
domination
of
the
long
parliament
according
to
a
list
that
has
been
preserved
amounted
to
between
three
and
four
thousand
persons
the
legal
profession
no
less
than
the
clerical
asserted
its
belief
in
witchcraft
referring
to
the
bible
in
confirmation
blackstone
said
to
deny
the
possibility
nay
the
actual
existence
of
witchcraft
and
sorcery
is
at
once
flatly
to
contradict
the
revealed
word
of
god
in
various
passages
of
the
old
and
new
testament
and
the
thing
itself
is
a
truth
to
which
every
nation
in
the
world
hath
in
its
turn
borne
testimony
either
by
examples
seemingly
well
attested
or
by
prohibiting
laws
the
protestant
clergy
equally
with
the
catholic
priesthood
were
charged
with
fostering
a
belief
in
witchcraft
for
the
purpose
of
gain
at
no
period
of
the
world
has
a
more
diabolical
system
of
robbery
existed
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pounds
or
pence
the
most
helpless
of
human
beings
made
helpless
through
church
teaching
as
to
their
unworthiness
were
by
the
church
daily
brought
under
accusation
exposing
them
to
a
cruel
death
at
the
hand
of
irresponsible
tyranny
the
system
of
thuggery
in
india
shines
white
by
side
of
this
christian
system
of
robbery
inaugurated
by
the
church
and
sustained
by
the
state
in
the
name
of
religion
the
worst
crimes
against
humanity
have
ever
been
perpetrated
on
the
accession
of
james
i
he
ordered
the
learned
work
of
reginald
scott
against
witchcraft
to
be
burned
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
parliament
which
ratified
a
belief
in
witchcraft
in
the
three
kingdoms
at
this
date
the
tragedy
of
macbeth
appeared
deeply
tinged
with
the
belief
of
the
times
a
few
persons
maintaining
possession
of
their
senses
recognized
the
fact
that
fear
apprehension
and
melancholy
gave
birth
to
the
wildest
medical
experience
recording
many
instances
of
this
character
in
an
age
when
ignorance
and
superstition
prevailed
among
the
people
at
large
while
vice
ignorance
and
cupidity
were
in
equal
force
among
those
in
power
the
strangest
beliefs
became
prevalent
sir
george
mackenzie
the
eminent
king
s
advocate
of
scotland
conducting
many
trials
for
witchcraft
became
convinced
it
was
largely
a
subject
of
fear
and
delusion
he
said
those
poor
persons
who
are
ordinarily
accused
of
this
crime
are
poor
ignorant
creatures
and
ofttimes
women
who
understood
not
the
nature
of
what
they
are
accused
of
and
many
mistake
their
own
fears
and
apprehensions
for
witchcraft
of
which
i
shall
give
you
two
instances
one
of
a
poor
man
who
after
he
had
confessed
witchcraft
being
asked
how
he
saw
the
devil
he
answered
like
flies
dancing
about
a
another
of
a
woman
who
asked
sincerely
when
accused
if
a
woman
might
be
a
witch
and
not
know
it
and
it
is
dangerous
then
those
who
of
all
others
are
the
most
simple
should
be
tried
for
a
crime
which
of
all
others
is
the
most
mysterious
those
poor
creatures
when
defamed
became
so
confused
with
fear
and
the
close
prison
in
which
they
were
kept
and
so
starved
for
want
of
meals
and
sleep
either
of
which
wants
is
enough
to
destroy
the
strongest
reason
when
men
are
confounded
with
fear
and
apprehension
they
will
imagine
things
very
ridiculous
and
absurd
melancholy
often
makes
men
imagine
they
are
horses
most
of
these
poor
creatures
are
tortured
by
their
keepers
who
are
persuaded
they
do
god
good
service
most
of
all
that
were
taken
were
tortured
in
this
manner
and
this
usage
was
the
ground
of
their
complaints
to
such
an
extent
was
this
persecution
carried
even
in
protestant
scotland
that
accused
women
sometimes
admitted
their
guilt
that
they
might
die
and
thus
escape
from
a
world
where
even
if
cleared
they
would
ever
after
be
looked
upon
with
suspicion
sir
george
mackenzie
visiting
some
women
who
had
confessed
one
of
them
told
him
under
secrecie
that
she
had
not
confessed
because
she
was
guilty
but
being
a
poor
creature
who
wrought
for
her
meat
and
being
defined
for
a
witch
she
knew
she
would
starve
for
no
person
thereafter
would
give
her
either
meat
or
lodging
and
that
all
men
would
beat
her
and
hound
dogs
at
her
and
therefore
she
desired
to
be
out
of
the
world
whereupon
she
wept
bitterly
and
upon
her
knees
called
upon
god
to
witness
what
she
said
even
under
all
the
evidence
of
the
persecution
and
cruel
tortures
that
innocent
women
endured
during
the
witchcraft
period
no
effort
of
the
imagination
can
portray
the
sufferings
of
an
accused
woman
the
death
this
poor
woman
chose
in
voluntarily
admitting
a
crime
of
which
she
was
innocent
rather
than
to
accept
a
chance
of
life
with
the
name
of
witch
clinging
to
her
was
one
of
the
most
painful
of
which
we
can
conceive
although
in
the
diversity
of
torture
inflicted
upon
the
witch
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
say
which
one
was
the
least
agonizing
in
no
country
has
the
devil
ever
been
more
fully
regarded
as
a
real
personage
ever
on
the
watch
for
souls
than
in
christian
scotland
sir
george
says
another
told
me
she
was
afraid
the
devil
would
challenge
a
right
to
her
soul
as
the
minister
said
when
he
desired
her
to
confess
and
therefore
she
desired
to
die
the
following
is
an
account
of
the
material
used
and
the
expenses
attending
the
execution
of
two
witches
in
scotland
for
loads
of
coal
to
burn
the
witches
a
tar
barrell
towes
hurdles
to
be
jumps
for
them
making
of
them
one
to
go
to
tinmouth
for
the
lord
to
sit
upon
the
assize
as
judge
the
executioner
for
his
pains
his
expenses
there
what
was
the
special
office
of
the
executioner
does
not
appear
whether
to
drag
the
victims
upon
hurdles
to
the
places
of
burning
to
light
the
fire
to
keep
it
well
blazing
is
not
mentioned
although
his
office
was
important
and
a
well
paid
one
eight
pounds
and
fourteen
shillings
above
his
expenses
sixteen
shillings
and
four
pence
more
in
all
nine
pounds
ten
shillings
and
four
pence
a
sum
equal
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
dollars
of
the
present
day
at
these
rates
it
was
easy
to
find
men
for
the
purpose
desired
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
under
the
frequency
of
torture
the
payment
lessened
strange
experiences
sometimes
befell
those
who
were
tortured
a
cataleptic
or
hypnotic
state
coming
on
amid
their
most
cruel
sufferings
causing
an
entire
insensibility
to
pain
to
the
church
this
condition
was
sure
evidence
of
help
from
satan
and
caused
a
renewal
of
torture
as
soon
as
sensibility
returned
in
the
year
a
poor
widow
called
lucken
who
was
accused
of
being
a
witch
and
sentenced
to
the
rack
at
helmstadt
having
been
cruelly
tortured
by

turning
in

suffering
new
methods
were
continually
devised
many
of
these
instruments
are
now
on
exhibition
in
foreign
museums
one
called
the
spider
a
diabolical
iron
machine
with
curved
claws
for
tearing
out
a
woman
s
breasts
was
shown
in
the
united
states
but
a
few
years
since
in
protestant
calvinistic
scotland
where
hatred
of
popery
was
most
pronounced
the
persecution
of
witches
raged
with
the
greatest
violence
and
multitudes
of
women
died
shrieking
to
heaven
for
that
mercy
denied
them
by
christian
men
upon
earth
it
was
in
scotland
after
the
reformation
that
the
most
atrocious
tortures
for
the
witch
were
invented
one
of
the
most
diabolical
being
known
as
the
witches
by
means
of
a
loop
passed
about
the
head
this
instrument
of
four
iron
prongs
was
fastened
in
the
mouth
one
of
the
prongs
pressed
down
the
tongue
one
touched
the
palate
the
other
two
doing
their
barbarous
work
upon
the
inner
side
of
the
cheeks
as
this
instrument
prevented
speech
thus
allowing
no
complaint
upon
the
part
of
the
victim
it
was
preferred
to
many
other
methods
of
torture
the
woman
upon
whom
it
was
used
was
suspended
against
a
wall
by
a
loop
at
the
back
barely
touching
the
floor
with
her
toes
the
iron
band
around
her
neck
rendered
her
powerless
to
move
she
was
unable
to
speak
or
scarcely
to
breathe
every
muscle
was
strained
in
order
to
sustain
herself
and
prevent
entire
suffocation
the
least
movement
causing
cruel
wounds
by
means
of
the
prongs
in
her
mouth
the
victims
were
mostly
aged
women
who
having
reared
a
family
spending
their
youth
and
beauty
in
this
work
had
lived
until
time
threading
their
hair
with
silver
had
also
robbed
cheek
and
lip
of
their
rosy
hue
dimmed
the
brilliancy
of
the
eye
and
left
wrinkles
in
place
of
youthful
dimples
such
victims
were
left
for
hours
until
the
malignity
of
their
persecutors
was
satisfied
or
until
death
after
long
torture
released
them
from
a
world
where
under
the
laws
of
both
church
and
state
they
found
their
sex
to
be
a
crime
old
women
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
were
old
were
held
to
be
the
most
susceptible
to
the
assaults
of
the
devil
and
the
persons
most
especially
endowed
with
supernatural
powers
for
evil
blackstone
refers
to
this
persecution
of
aged
women
in
his
reference
to
a
statute
of
the
eight
henry
we
discover
a
reason
for
this
intense
hatred
of
old
women
in
the
fact
that
woman
has
chiefly
been
looked
upon
from
a
sensual
view
by
christian
men
the
church
teaching
that
she
was
created
solely
for
man
s
sensual
use
thus
when
by
reason
of
declining
years
she
no
longer
attracted
the
sensual
admiration
of
man
he
regarded
her
as
having
forfeited
all
right
to
life
england
s
most
learned
judge
sir
mathew
hale
declared
his
belief
in
the
agency
of
the
devil
in
producing
diseases
through
the
aid
of
old
women
the
prosecution
against
this
class
raged
with
unusual
violence
in
scotland
under
the
covenanters
to
deny
the
existence
of
especially
evil
supernatural
powers
in
old
women
was
held
as
an
evidence
of
skepticism
exposing
the
doubting
person
to
like
suspicion
great
numbers
of
women
were
put
to
death
at
a
time
so
common
indeed
was
the
sight
as
to
cause
but
little
comment
a
scotch
traveler
casually
mentioned
having
seen
nine
women
burning
together
at
bath
in
knox
himself
suffered
a
woman
to
be
burned
at
andrews
whom
one
word
from
him
would
have
saved
father
tanner
speaks
of
the
multitude
of
witches
who
were
daily
brought
under
the
torture
that
was
constantly
practiced
by
the
church
the
reformers
were
more
cruel
than
those
from
whose
superstitious
teachings
they
professed
to
have
escaped
all
the
tortures
of
the
old
church
were
repeated
and
an
unusual
number
of
new
and
diabolical
ones
invented
to
induce
confession
nor
were
these
tortures
applied
to
the
suspected
witch
alone
her
young
and
tender
children
against
whom
no
accusation
had
been
brought
were
sometimes
tortured
in
her
presence
in
order
to
wring
confession
from
the
mother
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
endured
the
most
intense
torture
constantly
asserting
her
innocence
failing
to
secure
confession
her
husband
her
son
and
finally
her
young
daughter
of
seven
short
years
were
tortured
in
her
presence
the
latter
being
subjected
to
a
species
of
called
the
pinniwinkies
which
brought
blood
from
under
the
finger
nails
with
a
pain
terribly
severe
when
these
were
applied
to
the
baby
hands
to
spare
her
innocent
child
the
mother
confessed
herself
a
witch
but
after
enduring
all
the
agonies
of
torture
upon
herself
and
all
she
was
made
to
suffer
in
the
persons
of
her
innocent
family
confession
having
been
obtained
through
this
diabolical
means
she
was
still
condemned
to
the
flames
undergoing
death
at
the
stake
a
blazing
torch
of
fire
and
died
calling
upon
god
for
that
mercy
she
could
not
find
at
the
hands
of
christian
men
in
protestant
scotland
as
in
catholic
countries
witchcraft
was
under
control
of
the
clergy
when
a
woman
fell
under
suspicion
of
being
a
witch
the
minister
denounced
her
from
the
pulpit
forbade
any
one
to
harbor
or
shelter
her
and
exhorted
his
parishioners
to
give
evidence
against
her
she
was
under
ban
similar
to
the
excommunicate
of
the
catholic
church
a
being
outside
of
human
help
or
sympathy
in
protestant
as
in
catholic
countries
the
woman
accused
was
virtually
dead
she
was
excommunicated
from
humanity
designated
and
denounced
as
one
whom
all
must
shun
to
whom
no
one
must
give
food
or
lodging
or
speech
or
shelter
life
was
not
worth
the
living
to
afford
such
a
one
aid
was
to
hazard
accusation
as
a
confederate
the
first
complaint
was
made
to
the
clergy
and
kirk
sessions
notwithstanding
two
hundred
years
of
such
experience
when
by
an
act
of
parliament
in
the
burning
and
hanging
of
witches
was
abolished
the
general
assembly
of
the
calvinistic
church
of
scotland
confessed
this
act
as
a
great
national
not
only
were
the
courts
and
the
church
alert
for
the
detection
of
alleged
witches
but
the
populace
persecuted
many
to
death
deserted
by
her
friends
the
suspected
witch
was
beaten
worried
by
dogs
denied
food
and
prevented
from
sleeping
contrary
to
equity
and
the
principles
of
modern
law
the
church
sought
in
every
way
to
entrap
victims
into
giving
evidence
against
themselves
once
a
person
was
accused
no
effort
was
spared
to
induce
confession
holding
control
over
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
enquiry
into
these
crimes
was
pushed
by
every
method
that
human
ingenuity
could
devise
the
kirk
became
the
stronghold
of
superstition
both
rewards
and
punishments
were
used
as
inducements
towards
ferreting
out
witches
all
ties
of
natural
affection
were
ignored
the
kirk
preaching
it
to
be
a
matter
of
greater
duty
to
inform
against
one
s
nearest
relatives
than
against
strangers
unlike
the
theory
of
roman
civil
law
which
held
the
accused
innocent
until
proven
guilty
ecclesiastical
law
everywhere
produced
a
condition
under
which
the
accused
was
held
guilty
from
the
moment
of
accusation
during
the
witchcraft
period
the
minds
of
people
were
trained
in
a
single
direction
the
chief
lesson
of
the
church
that
betrayal
of
friends
was
necessary
to
one
s
own
salvation
created
an
intense
selfishness
all
humanitarian
feeling
was
lost
in
the
effort
to
secure
heaven
at
the
expense
of
others
even
those
most
closely
bound
by
ties
of
nature
and
affection
mercy
tenderness
compassion
were
all
obliterated
truthfulness
escaped
from
the
christian
world
fear
sorrow
and
cruelty
reigned
all
regard
that
existed
for
others
grew
up
outside
of
church
teaching
and
was
shown
at
the
hazard
of
life
contempt
and
hatred
of
woman
was
inculcated
with
greater
intensity
love
of
power
and
treachery
were
parts
of
the
selfish
lessons
of
the
church
all
reverence
for
length
of
years
was
lost
the
sorrows
and
sufferings
of
a
long
life
appealed
to
no
sympathetic
cord
in
the
heart
instead
of
the
tenderness
and
care
due
to
aged
women
they
were
so
frequently
accused
of
witchcraft
that
for
years
it
was
an
unusual
thing
for
an
old
woman
in
the
north
of
europe
to
die
in
her
bed
besides
the
thousands
of
accused
who
committed
suicide
in
order
to
escape
the
horrors
incident
upon
trial
many
others
tired
of
life
amid
so
much
humiliation
and
suffering
falsely
accused
themselves
preferring
a
death
by
the
torture
of
fire
to
a
life
of
endless
isolation
and
persecution
an
english
woman
on
her
way
to
the
stake
with
a
greatness
of
soul
born
of
despair
freed
her
judges
from
responsibility
by
saying
to
the
people
do
not
blame
my
judges
i
wished
to
put
an
end
to
my
own
self
my
parents
keep
aloof
from
me
my
own
husband
has
denied
me
i
could
not
live
on
without
disgrace
i
longed
for
death
and
so
i
told
a
the
most
eminent
legal
minds
became
incompetent
to
form
correct
judgment
having
received
the
church
as
of
divine
origin
and
its
priesthood
as
the
representatives
of
the
divinity
they
were
no
longer
capable
of
justice
old
and
ignorant
women
upon
the
most
frivolous
testimony
of
young
children
were
condemned
to
death
one
of
the
most
notable
examples
of
the
power
of
superstitious
belief
to
darken
the
understanding
is
that
of
sir
matthew
hale
living
in
the
seventeenth
century
he
was
spoken
of
by
his
contemporaries
as
one
of
the
most
eminent
jurists
of
the
world
whose
integrity
learning
and
knowledge
of
law
were
scarcely
to
be
paralleled
in
any
age
and
yet
he
became
so
entirely
convinced
of
the
diabolism
of
two
women
as
to
condemn
them
to
death
while
sitting
at
bury
edmunds
without
even
summing
up
the
evidence
the
learned
and
famous
sir
thomas
browne
who
was
present
coincided
in
the
justice
of
this
decision
although
but
a
short
time
previously
he
had
published
a
work
against
superstition
the
testimony
upon
which
these
women
were
condemned
was
of
the
most
petty
and
worthless
character
yet
among
all
the
persons
present
at
the
trial
but
one
or
two
seemed
inclined
to
doubt
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
the
records
of
this
remarkable
trial
were
preserved
to
the
world
by
a
gentleman
who
privately
took
a
report
for
his
own
use
which
was
published
in
pamphlet
form
a
number
of
years
afterwards
this
extremely
rare
book
is
not
to
be
found
even
in
the
congressional
library
at
washington
but
the
supreme
court
library
owns
a
copy
from
which
this
report
is
taken
trial
march
by
sir
matthew
hale
knight
lord
chief
baron
of
his
majesty
s
court
of
exchequer
held
before
a
judge
who
for
his
integrity
learning
and
wisdom
hardly
any
age
before
or
since
could
parallel
he
not
only
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
and
spent
much
time
in
this
trial
himself
but
had
the
assistance
and
opinion
of
several
other
very
eminent
and
learned
persons
so
that
this
was
the
most
perfect
narrative
of
anything
of
this
nature
hitherto
extant
the
persons
tried
were
ann
durant
or
drury
susan
chandler
elizabeth
pacy
the
celebrated
brown
of
norwich
who
had
written
a
work
against
witchcraft
was
present
and
after
hearing
the
evidence
expressed
himself
as
clearly
of
the
opinion
the
persons
were
bewitched
and
said
in
denmark
lately
there
had
been
a
great
discovery
of
witches
who
used
the
same
way
of
afflicting
persons
by
the
agency
of
pins
this
trial
took
place
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
charles
ii
the
witnesses
were
two
children
of
eleven
and
nine
years
who
fell
into
fits
vomiting
pins
and
nails
sargeant
keeling
asserted
deception
on
part
of
the
witnesses
the
court
appointed
lord
cornwallis
sir
edmund
bacon
and
sargeant
keeling
as
committee
to
examine
the
girl
alone
when
they
became
fully
satisfied
of
her
imposture
but
without
convincing
the
learned
judge
who
contrary
to
all
justice
and
law
did
not
sum
up
the
evidence
but
gave
the
great
weight
of
his
opinion
in
favor
of
their
guilt
saying
that
there
are
such
creatures
as
witches
i
have
not
doubt
at
all
for
first
scripture
has
offered
so
much
second
the
wisdom
of
all
nations
has
propounded
laws
against
such
persons
which
is
an
argument
of
their
confidence
of
such
a
crime
and
such
has
been
the
judgment
of
this
kingdom
as
appears
by
that
act
of
parliament
which
hath
provided
punishments
proportionate
to
the
guilt
of
this
offense
and
desired
them
strictly
to
observe
the
evidence
and
desired
the
great
god
of
heaven
to
direct
their
hearts
in
the
weighty
things
they
had
so
heard
for
to
condemn
the
innocent
and
to
let
the
guilty
go
free
were
both
an
abomination
to
the
lord
within
half
an
hour
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
thirteen
counts
the
judge
and
all
the
court
were
fully
satisfied
with
the
verdict
and
therefore
gave
judgment
against
the
witches
that
they
should
be
hanged
the
evidence
was
of
the
most
paltry
character
as
when
out

a
little
thing
like
a
bee
flew
upon

the

were
produced
in
court
when
arraigned
the
accused
pleaded
not
guilty
nor
did
they
ever
change
this
plea
great
pressure
was
upon
them
to
induce
confession
but
they
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
thus
criminate
themselves
and
were
executed
the
seventeenth
of
march
just
one
week
after
trial
confessing
nothing
this
trial
is
the
more
remarkable
that
confessions
usually
deemed
the
best
of
evidence
were
not
obtained
these
poor
illiterate
persecuted
women
braving
all
the
learning
of
the
great
judge
and
power
of
the
kingdom
in
maintaining
to
the
last
the
assertion
of
their
innocence
the
minutes
of
this
trial
were
taken
by
a
gentleman
in
attendance
upon
the
court
and
were
not
published
until
when
the
record
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
person
who
saw
its
value
so
that
he
says
being
the
most
complete
minutes
of
anything
of
this
nature
hitherto
extant
made
me
unwilling
to
deprive
the
world
of
it
which
is
the
sole
motive
that
induced
me
to
publish
not
alone
the
clergy
and
the
legal
fraternity
wrought
in
unison
but
the
medical
as
well
gave
the
weight
of
their
authority
in
favor
of
witchcraft
and
many
persons
needing
the
wisest
medical
appliance
for
their
relief
from
disease
were
executed
as
witches
and
insane
persons
met
with
the
same
persecution
as
old
women
it
was
an
era
of
the
strong
against
the
weak
the
powerful
against
the
helpless
even
sir
thomas
browne
himself
a
physician
regarded
the
fainting
fits
to
which
one
of
the
accused
women
had
long
been
subject
as
fuller
evidence
of
her
guilt
in
his
character
of
medical
examiner
he
asserted
that
the
devil
had
taken
opportunity
of
her
natural
fits
to
operate
with
her
malice
an
almost
equally
notable
trial
as
that
of
bury
edmunds
before
sir
matthew
hale
was
known
as
the
sommers
trial
or
that
of
the
lancashire
witches
in
among
the
accused
were
two
extremely
aged
women
decrepit
and
nearly
blind
tottering
into
second
childhood
incapable
of
understanding
whereof
they
were
accused
or
the
evidence
against
them
which
as
in
the
case
argued
before
sir
matthew
hale
was
of
the
most
worthless
character
one
needs
but
refer
to
the
records
in
order
to
learn
the
extreme
age
ignorance
and
many
infirmities
of
these
women
but
as
was
the
case
in
scotland
these
weaknesses
were
used
as
evidences
of
guilt
the
feeble
mental
and
physical
condition
of
the
lancashire
witches
their
great
age
and
failing
power
were
used
as
evidence
for
their
condemnation
from
published
accounts
of
this
trial
we
learn
that
this
annie
whittle
alias
chattox
was
a
very
old
withered
and
decrepit
creature
her
sight
almost
gone
a
dangerous
witch
of
very
long
continuance
her
lips
ever
chattering
and
walking
talking
but
no
one
knew
what
she
was
next
in
order
to
that
wicked
fierce
bird
of
mischief
old
demdike
this
poor
old
creature
confessed
that
robert
mutter
had
offered
insult
to
her
married
daughter
and
the
court
decreed
this
was
a
fair
proof
of
her
having
bewitched
him
to
his
death
no
condemnation
of
the
man
who
had
thus
insulted
her
daughter
but
death
for
the
aged
mother
who
had
resented
this
insult
designated
as
old
demdike
a
fierce
bird
of
mischief
this
woman
of
four
score
years
of
age
had
not
only
brought
up
a
large
family
of
her
own
but
her
grand
children
had
fallen
to
her
care
she
had
lived
a
blameless
life
of
over
eighty
years
much
of
it
devoted
to
the
care
of
children
and
children
s
children
but
when
decrepit
and
almost
blind
she
fell
under
suspicion
of
a
crime
held
by
church
and
state
as
of
the
most
baleful
character
her
blameless
and
industrious
life
proved
of
no
avail
against
this
accusation
she
seems
to
have
originally
been
a
woman
of
great
force
of
character
and
executive
ability
but
frightened
at
an
accusation
she
could
not
understand
and
overpowered
by
all
the
dread
majesty
of
the
law
into
whose
merciless
power
she
had
fallen
she
confessed
to
communion
with
a
demon
spirit
which
appeared
to
her
in
the
form
of
a
brown
dog
from
a
work
entitled
the
sommers
trials
the
form
of
indictment
is
learned
indictment
this
annie
whittle
alias
chattox
of
the
forest
of
pendle
in
the
countie
of
lancaster
widow
being
indicted
for
that
she
feloniously
had
practiced
used
and
exercised
divers
wicked
and
divelish
artes
called
witchcraftes
inchantments
charms
and
sorceries
in
and
upon
one
robert
nutter
of
greenhead
in
the
forest
of
pendle
in
the
countie
of
lanc
and
by
force
of
the
same
witchcraft
feloniously
the
sayed
robert
nutter
had
killed
contra
pacem
etc
being
at
the
barre
was
arraigned
to
this
indictment
upon
her
arraignment
she
pleaded
not
guiltie
and
for
the
tryall
of
her
life
put
herself
upon
god
and
her
country
one
of
the
chief
witnesses
at
this
trial
was
a
child
of
nine
years
upon
seeing
her
own
daughter
arraigned
against
her
the
mother
broke
into
shrieks
and
lamentations
pleading
with
the
girl
not
to
falsify
the
truth
and
thus
condemn
her
own
mother
to
death
the
judges
instead
of
seeing
in
this
agony
a
proof
of
the
mother
s
innocence
looked
upon
it
as
an
attempt
to
thwart
the
ends
of
justice
by
demoniac
influence
and
the
child
having
declared
that
she
could
not
confess
in
her
mother
s
presence
the
latter
was
removed
from
the
room
and
as
under
the
inquisition
the
testimony
was
given
in
the
absence
of
the
accused
the
child
then
said
that
her
mother
had
been
a
witch
for
three
or
four
years
the
devil
appearing
in
the
form
of
a
brown
dog
bill
these
trials
taking
place
in
protestant
england
two
hundred
years
after
the
reformation
prove
the
worthless
nature
of
witchcraft
testimony
as
well
as
the
superstition
ignorance
and
entire
unfitness
for
the
bench
of
those
men
called
the
highest
judicial
minds
in
england
the
church
having
almost
entirely
destroyed
freedom
of
will
and
the
expression
of
individual
thought
men
came
to
look
upon
authority
and
right
as
synonymous
works
bearing
the
stamp
of
the
legal
fraternity
soon
appeared
in
a
volume
entitled
the
county
justice
by
michael
dalton
gentleman
of
lincoln
inn
was
published
in
london
its
chief
object
to
give
directions
based
upon
this
trial
for
the
discovery
of
witches
now
against
these
witches
the
justice
of
the
peace
may
not
always
expect
direct
evidence
seeing
all
their
works
are
works
of
darkness
and
no
witness
permitted
with
them
to
accuse
them
and
therefore
for
their
better
discovery
i
thought
good
here
to
set
down
certain
observations
out
of
the
methods
of
discovery
of
the
witches
that
were
arraigned
at
lancaster
before
sir
james
altham
and
sir
edward
bromley
judges
of
assize
there
they
have
ordinarily
a
familiar
or
spirit
which
appeareth
to
them
the
said
familiar
hath
some
bigg
or
place
upon
their
body
where
he
sucketh
them
they
have
often
pictures
of
clay
or
wax
like
a
man
etc
found
in
their
house
if
the
dead
body
bleed
upon
the
witches
touching
it
the
testimony
of
the
person
hurt
upon
his
death
the
examination
and
confession
of
the
children
or
servants
of
the
witch
their
own
voluntary
confession
which
exceeds
all
other
evidence
at
this
period
many
persons
either
in
hope
of
a
reward
or
because
they
believed
they
were
thus
aiding
the
cause
of
justice
kept
private
notebooks
of
instruction
in
the
examination
of
witches
and
new
varieties
were
constantly
discovered
when
witchcraft
by
act
of
parliament
was
decreed
felony
this
statute
gave
the
legal
fraternity
double
authority
for
a
belief
in
its
existence
even
sir
george
mackenzie
although
convinced
by
his
own
experience
that
many
persons
were
wrongfully
accused
of
witchcraft
still
declared
that
its
existence
could
not
be
doubted
seeing
that
our
law
ordains
it
to
be
punished
with
the
most
fatal
record
the
world
possesses
of
the
plague
is
that
of
the
fourteenth
century
known
as
the
black
death
when
whole
villages
were
depopulated
and
more
than
half
the
inhabitants
of
europe
were
destroyed
it
will
aid
in
forming
our
judgment
as
to
the
extent
of
woman
s
persecution
for
witchcraft
to
remember
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
number
of
deaths
from
this
cause
equalled
those
of
the
plague
the
american
colonies
adopted
all
the
unjust
previsions
of
european
christianity
as
parts
of
their
own
religion
and
government
fleeing
from
persecution
the
puritans
yet
brought
with
them
the
spirit
of
persecution
in
the
belief
of
woman
s
inferiority
and
wickedness
as
taught
by
the
church
from
whence
they
had
fled
the
ducking
stool
for
women
who
too
vigorously
protested
against
their
wrongs
and
the
scarlet
letter
of
shame
for
the
woman
who
had
transgressed
the
moral
law
her
companion
in
sin
going
free
or
as
in
england
sitting
as
juror
in
the
box
or
judge
upon
the
bench
with
them
also
came
a
belief
in
witchcraft
which
soon
caused
massachusetts
colony
to
enact
a
law
ordering
suspected
women
to
be
stripped
naked
their
bodies
to
be
carefully
examined
by
a
male
witch
pricker
to
see
if
there
was
not
the
devil
s
mark
upon
them
the
public
whipping
of
half
naked
women
at
the
cart
s
tail
for
the
crime
of
religious
free
thought
soon
followed
a
union
of
both
religious
and
judicial
punishment
together
with
banishment
of
women
from
the
colony
for
daring
to
preach
christ
as
they
understood
his
doctrines
these
customs
more
barbarous
than
those
of
the
savages
whose
home
they
had
invaded
were
the
pleasing
welcome
given
to
the
pioneer
woman
settlers
of
america
by
the
husbands
and
fathers
judges
and
ministers
of
that
period
with
which
the
words
plymouth
rock
may
flower
and
pilgrim
fathers
are
so
intimately
associated
the
same
persecution
of
aged
women
took
place
in
new
england
as
in
old
england
while
children
of
even
more
tender
years
were
used
as
witnesses
against
their
mothers
if
accused
of
witchcraft
or
were
themselves
imprisoned
upon
like
suspicion
the
village
of
salem
massachusetts
is
indissolubly
connected
with
witchcraft
for
there
the
persecution
raged
most
fiercely
involving
its
best

issued

mather
president
of

was
one
of
the
most
bitter
persecutors
of
witches
in

england
the
dangerous
spirit
of
a
religious
autocracy
like
the
priesthood
was
forcibly
shown
by
a
paper
read
by
rev
george
ellis
a
few
years
since
before
the
massachusetts
historical
society
in
which
he
excused
the
act
of
stripping
women
naked
in
order
to
search
for
a
witch
mark
upon
the
ground
of
its
being
a
judicial
one
by
commissioned
officers
and
universally
practiced
in
christendom
boston
as
the
bloody
town
rivalled
salem
in
its
persecution
of
women
who
dared
express
thoughts
upon
religious
matters
in
contradiction
to
the
puritanic
belief
women
were
whipped
because
of
independent
religious
belief
new
england
showing
itself
as
strenuous
for
conformity
of
religious
opinion
as
old
england
under
queen
elizabeth
the
cruelties
of
this
method
of
punishing
free
thought
culminated
in
the
vagabond
law
of
massachusetts
colony
passed
may
the
first
ecclesiastical
convocation
in
america
was
a
synod
especially
conveyed
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
the
religious
views
of
mistress
anne
hutchinson
who
demanded
that
the
same
rights
of
individual
judgment
upon
religious
questions
should
be
accorded
to
woman
which
the
reformation
had
already
secured
to
man
of
the
errors
canvassed
by
the
synod
twenty
nine
were
charged
to
mistress
hutchinson
and
retraction
of
them
was
ordered
by
the
church
the
state
united
with
the
church
in
opposition
to
mistress
hutchinson
and
the
first
real
struggle
for
woman
s
religious
liberty
not
yet
at
an
end
began
upon
this
side
of
the
atlantic
the
principal
charge
brought
against
mistress
hutchinson
was
that
she
had
presumed
to
instruct
men
possessed
of
a
fine
intellect
and
strong
religious
fervor
she
had
inaugurated
private
meetings
for
the
instruction
of
her
own
sex
from
sixty
to
a
hundred
women
regularly
gathering
at
her
house
to
hear
her
criticism
upon
the
sunday
sermon
and
thursday
lectures
these
meetings
proved
so
interesting
that
men
were
soon
found
also
in
attendance
and
for
these
reasons
she
was
arbitrarily
tried
in
november
before
the
massachusetts
general
court
upon
a
joint
charge
of
sedition
and
heresy
in
may
of
the
same
year
a
change
had
taken
place
in
the
civil
government
of
the
colony
sir
henry
vane
who
like
herself
believed
in
the
supreme
authority
of
the
spirit
having
been
superseded
by
john
winthrop
as
governor
the
latter
sustaining
the
power
of
the
clergy
and
himself
taking
part
against
her
two
days
were
spent
by
him
and
prominent
clergymen
in
her
examination
resulting
in
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
and
banishment
from
the
colony
for
having
traduced
the
ministers
and
taught
men
against
the
direct
authority
of
the
apostle
paul
who
declared
i
suffer
not
a
woman
to
thus
the
old
world
restrictions
upon
woman
and
their
persecutions
were
soon
duplicated
in
the
new
world
liberty
of
opinion
became
as
serious
a
crime
in
america
as
in
england
and
here
as
in
europe
the
most
saintly
virtue
and
the
purest
life
among
women
were
not
proof
against
priestly
attack
while
mistress
hutchinson
was
the
first
woman
thus
to
suffer
many
others
were
also
persecuted
when
mary
fisher
and
anne
austin
two
quaker
women
who
had
become
famous
for
their
promulgation
of
this
heretical
doctrine
in
many
parts
of
the
world
arrived
in
boston
harbor
july
they
were
not
at
first
permitted
to
land
but
were
ultimately
transferred
to
the
boston
jail
where
they
were
closely
confined
and
notwithstanding
the
heat
of
the
weather
their
one
window
was
boarded
up
their
persons
were
also
stripped
and
examined
for
signs
of
witchcraft
but
fortunately
not
a
mole
or
a
spot
could
be
found
the
bloody
town
the
center
of
this
persecuting
spirit
and
every
species
of
wanton
cruelty
upon
woman
was
enacted
stripped
nude
to
the
waist
they
were
tied
to
a
on
the
south
side
of
king
street
and
flogged
on
account
of
their
religious
opinions
but
it
was
upon
the
famous
common
that
for
the
crime
of
free
speech
a
half
nude
woman
with
a
new
born
babe
at
her
breast
was
thus
publicly
whipped
and
it
was
upon
the
common
that
mary
dyer
another
quaker
woman
was
hung
in
both
she
and
anne
hutchinson
prophesied
calamity
to
the
colony
for
its
unjust
course
which
was
fulfilled
when
in
it
lost
its
charter
in
punishment
for
its
intolerance
no
christian
country
offered
a
refuge
for
woman
as
did
canada
the
colored
slave
but
the
evils
of
woman
s
persecution
by
the
church
did
not
end
with
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
her
they
were
widely
extended
affecting
the
most
common
interests
of
the
world
while
famines
were
unknown
among
the
ancient
romans
in
the
first
period
of
their
history
yet
christendom
was
early
and
frequently
afflicted
with
them
while
the
operations
of
nature
were
sometimes
the
cause
the
majority
of
famines
were
the
result
of
persecutions
or
of
christian
wars
especially
the
crusades
which
took
such
immense
numbers
of
men
from
the
duties
of
agriculture
at
home
making
them
a
prey
upon
the
scanty
resources
of
the
countries
through
which
these
hordes
passed
as
was
seen
in
the
irish
famine
of
and
at
the
present
moment
as
result
of
a
scanty
food
supply
in
russia
pestilence
of
various
kinds
followed
famine
years
but
the
crusades
in
which
the
church
attempted
to
wrest
the
holy
sepulchre
from
turkish
hands
were
scarcely
more
productive
of
famines
than
its
persecuting
periods
when
mankind
lost
hope
in
themselves
and
the
future
our
own
country
has
shown
the
effect
of
fear
and
persecution
upon
both
business
and
religion
as
during
the
witchcraft
period
of
new
england
scarcely
two
hundred
years
since
all
business
of
whatever
nature
in
country
and
in
town
was
neglected
and
even
the
meeting
house
was
allowed
to
fall
out
of
repair
nor
was
this
ruin
of
a
temporary
nature
as
many
people
left
the
colony
and
its
effects
descended
to
those
yet
unborn
both
bancroft
s
history
of
the
united
states
and
lapham
s
history
of
the
salem
witchcraft
paint
vivid
pictures
of
the
effects
following
the
different
church
persecutions
of
woman
of
the
hutchinson
trial
bancroft
says
this
dispute
infused
its
spirit
into
everything
it
interfered
with
the
levy
of
troops
for
the
pequot
war
it
influenced
the
respect
shown
to
magistrates
the
distribution
of
town
lots
the
assessment
of
rates
and
at
last
the
continued
existence
of
the
two
parties
was
considered
inconsistent
with
public
peace
of
the
witchcraft
period
upham
says
it
cast
its
shadows
over
a
broad
surface
and
they
darkened
the
condition
of
generations
the
fields
were
neglected
fences
roads
barns
even
the
meeting
house
went
into
disrepair
a
scarcity
of
provisions
nearly
amounting
to
a
famine
continued
for
some
time
farms
were
brought
under
mortgage
or
sacrificed
and
large
numbers
of
people
were
dispersed
the
worst
results
were
not
confined
to
the
village
but
spread
more
or
less
over
the
country
massachusetts
was
not
the
only
colony
that
treated
witchcraft
as
a
crime
maryland
new
jersey
and
virginia
possessed
similar
enactments
witchcraft

the

acting
under

found

for

we
gain
fuller
comprehension
of
the
cruelties
inflicted
by

upon

portion
of

to
cast

to

church
history
is
not
silent
upon
such
instances
and
mention
is
made
of
a
husband
who
by
a
rope
about
the
neck
dragged
his
wife
before
that
arch
inquisitor
sprenger
making
accusation
of
witchcraft
against
her
no
less
from
protestant
than
from
catholic
pulpits
were
people
exhorted
to
bring
the
witch
even
if
of
one
s
own
family
to
justice
in
the
statute
against
witchcraft
was
repealed
by
the
english
parliament
yet
a
belief
in
witchcraft
is
still
largely
prevalent
even
among
educated
people
lee
the
vicar
of
an
english
church
that
of
all
saints
in
lambeth
a
few
years
since
publicly
deprecated
the
abolition
of
its
penalties
in
a
work
entitled
glimpses
of
the
twilight
complaining
that
the
laws
against
witchcraft
had
been
foolishly
and
a
remarkable
case
occurred
in
prussia
when
the
father
of
a
girl
having
become
persuaded
that
his
daughter
was
bewitched
by
a
woman
who
had
occasionally
given
her
apples
and
pears
was
advised
the
child
would
be
cured
if
she
drank
some
of
the
blood
of
the
supposed
witch
the
woman
was
therefore
entrapped
into
a
place
where
some
of
the
chief
men
of
the
commune
had
assembled
to
receive
her
she
was
seized
one
of
her
fingers
pricked
with
a
needle
and
her
blood
given
to
the
sick
child
in
a
case
of
slander
based
upon
alleged
witchcraft
came
before
justice
randolphs
district
court
of
jersey
city
the
justice
listened
to
the
evidence
for
several
hours
before
recalling
the
fact
that
there
was
no
law
upon
which
he
could
base
his
decision
the
latest
legislation
being
the
law
of
repealed
twenty
years
after
our
declaration
of
independence
the
crime
was
no
longer
officially
recognized
it
is
curious
to
note
the
close
parallel
between
accusations
during
the
witchcraft
period
and
those
against
the
new
jersey
suspect
of
it
was
said
of
her
that
during
the
night
she
accomplished
such
feats
by
supernatural
power
as
jumping
from
a
third
story
window
alighting
upon
a
gate
post
as
gently
as
a
falling
feather
it
was
also
asserted
that
people
whom
she
was
known
to
dislike
became
gradually
ill
wasting
away
until
they
died
the
accused
woman
declared
it
was
her
superior
knowledge
that
was
feared
and
thus
again
the
middle
ages
are
paralleled
as
the
witches
of
that
period
were
usually
women
of
superior
knowledge
in
a
wisconsin
farmer
was
put
under
bonds
to
keep
the
peace
on
account
of
his
attempts
to
assault
an
old
lady
who
he
averred
was
a
witch
who
injured
his
cattle
and
entered
his
house
through
the
chimney
or
key
hole
to
his
great
terror
and
distress
the
state
of
indiana
about
sixty
years
ago
possessed
a
neighborhood
where
the
people
believed
in
witchcraft
if
the
butter
failed
to
come
or
the
eggs
to
hatch
or
a
calf
got
choked
or
even
if
the
rail
fences
fell
down
when
covered
with
sleet
and
snow
the
whole
trouble
was
attributed
to
the
witches
who
were
also
believed
to
have
the
remarkable
power
of
saddling
and
bridling
a
man
and
with
sharp
spurs
riding
him
over
the
worst
roads
imaginable
to
his
great
harm
and
fatigue
even
the
great
empire
state
as
late
as
january
had
within
its
borders
a
case
of
murder
where
an
inoffensive
old
man
lost
his
life
because
he
was
believed
to
be
a
wizard
and
this
occurred
in
the
center
of
a
prosperous
farming
country
where
money
is
liberally
expended
for
educational
purposes
this
being
one
of
the
rare
instances
where
a
man
fell
under
suspicion
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
great
and
enlightened
city
of
paris
caused
the
arrest
under
police
authority
of
fourteen
women
upon
charge
of
sorcery
and
it
is
but
little
more
than
twenty
years
since
a
woman
in
the
state
of
puebla
mexico
was
hung
and
burned
as
a
witch
because
unable
to
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
a
lost
animal
she
was
seized
hung
to
a
tree
shot
at
and
then
plunged
into
fire
until
she
expired
the
body
at
first
buried
in
the
cemetery
was
exhumed
the
following
day
by
order
of
the
priest
who
refused
to
allow
the
remains
of
a
witch
to
be
buried
in
consecrated
ground
the
state
in
person
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
authorized
the
proceedings
by
taking
part
in
them
as
principal
persecutor
in
the
same
province
another
woman
was
severely
flogged
as
a
witch
by
four
men
one
of
them
her
own
son
thus
now
as
in
its
earlier
ages
wherever
the
light
of
civilization
has
not
overcome
the
darkness
of
the
church
we
find
woman
still
a
sufferer
from
that
ignorance
and
superstition
which
under
christianity
teaches
that
she
brought
sin
into
the
world
under
roman
law
before
christianity
had
gained
control
of
the
empire
a
form
of
marriage
existed
known
as
usus
which
secured
much
freedom
to
wives
it
was
entered
into
without
the
terrifying
religious
ceremonies
which
made
confarreatio
practically
indissoluble
and
the
wife
the
veritable
slave
of
the
husband
who
held
power
even
over
her
life
neither
did
it
possess
the
civil
formality
of
coemptio
under
which
the
bride
purchased
entrance
into
the
marriage
duties
and
her
husband
s
household
by
the
payment
of
three
pieces
of
copper
coemptio
like
confarreatio
gave
the
husband
entire
power
over
the
person
and
property
of
the
wife
while
usus
a
form
of
simple
consent
left
the
wife
practically
free
keeping
her
own
name
and
property
the
real
origin
of
this
form
of
marriage
is
not
fully
known
maine
declared
it
to
be
as
old
as
or
even
older
than
the
twelve
tables
under
which
woman
possessed
the
right
to
repudiation
in
marriage
these
laws
a
compilation
of
still
older
ones
were
afterwards
incorporated
into
statutes
by
a
woman
of
athens
and
were
received
by
the
romans
as
extremely
pure
natural
laws
plato
refers
to
an
early
athens
entirely
ruled
by
women
its
laws
of
just
character
tradition
whose
basis
is
half
forgotten
half
remembered
history
attributes
the
origin
of
athens
to
the
ancient
atlantians
the
former
existence
of
this
submerged
continent
is
daily
becoming
more
fully
recognized
the
explorations
of
the
challenger
the
dolphin
the
gazelle
and
the
discoveries
of
le
plongeon
in
yucatan
at
later
date
confirming
olden
tradition
maine
thus
ascribes
a
much
older
origin
to
usus
than
gibbon
who
attributes
it
to
the
effect
of
the
punic
triumphs
in
reality
usus
seems
to
have
been
a
reminiscence
of
the
matriarchate
incorporated
into
the
law
of
the
twelve
tables
and
accepted
by
rome
as
a
more
just
form
of
the
marriage
relation
for
women
than
the
religious
confarraetio
or
the
civil
form
of
but
as
rome
increased
in
wealth
and
luxurious
modes
of
living
the
influence
of
the
patriarchate
correspondingly
extended
the
perception
of
justice
at
the
same
time
diminishing
pomp
and
ceremony
were
associated
with
the
marriage
rite
among
patricians
while
usus
was
regarded
as
a
plebeian
form
especially
suited
to
the
populace
but
at
later
date
when
rome
rebelling
against
the
tyranny
of
her
rulers
tended
towards
a
republican
form
of
government
usus
again
became
general
it
was
impossible
for
patrician
women
not
to
see
the
greater
freedom
of
plebeian
wives
under
usus
a
form
that
while
equally
binding
in
the
essentials
of
the
union
did
not
make
the
wife
a
marital
slave
and
usus
eventually
became
the
basis
of
roman
legal
conception
of
marriage
against
which
christianity
from
the
first
waged
a
warfare
of
ever
increasing
fierceness
the
very
foundation
of
that
religion
being
the
subordination
of
woman
in
every
relation
of
life
under
usus
the
mere
fact
of
two
persons
living
together
as
husband
and
wife
was
regarded
as
a
marriage
if
during
each
year
the
wife
remained
away
from
the
home
for
three
days
she
kept
herself
from
under
her
husband
s
power
she
remained
a
part
of
her
father
s
family
her
husband
could
not
mortgage
or
in
any
way
alienate
her
property
this
was
absolutely
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
christian
form
of
marriage
under
which
the
wife
surrendered
her
person
her
property
and
her
conscience
into
the
indisputable
control
of
the
husband
under
usus
a
large
proportion
of
roman
property
fell
into
woman
s
hands
she
became
the
real
estate
holder
of
the
eternal
city
and
its
provinces
and
in
consequence
was
treated
with
great
respect
the
holding
of
property
especially
of
real
estate
conducing
to
that
end
under
usus
the
cruelties
sanctioned
by
confarraetio
were
rendered
impossible
a
wife
could
no
longer
be
put
to
death
as
was
formerly
the
custom
for
having
tasted
wine
a
treacherous
kiss
from
her
husband
upon
his
return
home
betraying
her
nor
could
her
infant
daughter
be
exposed
or
murdered
at
the
pleasure
of
her
husband
who
as
inexorable
master
was
frequently
wont
to
refuse
her
pleadings
for
the
life
of
her
babe
calling
her
prayers
naught
but
the
scruples
of
a
foolish
woman
thus
under
usus
human
life
became
more
sacred
and
woman
endowed
with
a
greater
sense
of
personal
security
it
affected
an
entire
change
for
the
better
in
the
moral
sentiments
of
the
roman
empire
a
complete
revolution
had
thus
passed
over
the
constitution
of
the
family
this
must
have
been
the
period
says
maine
when
a
juriconsulist
of
the
empire
defined
marriage
as
a
life
long
fellowship
of
all
divine
and
human
rights
not
alone
maine
but
also
reeves
failed
not
to
see
that
the
disruption
of
the
roman
empire
was
very
unfavorable
to
the
personal
and
proprietory
rights
of
woman
the
practical
effect
of
the
common
roman
form
of
marriage
being
the
absolute
legal
independence
of
the
wife
under
which
a
large
proportion
of
roman
property
fell
into
the
hands
of
women
the
wife
retaining
her
family
name
and
family
inheritance
all
this
was
changed
as
soon
as
christianity
obtained
the
rule
under
christian
forms
of
marriage
a
wife
was
taken
from
her
own
family
and
transferred
into
that
of
her
husband
the
same
as
a
piece
of
property
she
assumed
his
name
the
same
as
the
slave
took
that
of
the
new
master
to
whom
he
was
transferred
that
this
idea
of
the
wife
as
a
slave
did
not
belong
alone
to
the
earlier
christian
period
but
is
a
part
of
christian
doctrine
of
today
is
clearly
shown
by
the
continued
custom
of
a
woman
s
dropping
her
family
name
upon
marriage
and
assuming
that
of
the
for
this
middle
roman
period
carried
its
blessings
to
wives
no
longer
than
until
the
empire
became
christianized
when
the
tyranny
of
ecclesiastical
marriage
again
fell
to
woman
s
lot
while
under
the
influence
of
usus
roman
jurists
of
the
middle
period
had
declared
the
ownership
of
property
by
married
women
to
be
a
principle
of
equity
this
drew
forth
opposing
legislation
from
the
christians
and
under
christian
law
the
husband
again
became
master
of
his
wife
s
person
and
property
her
children
also
falling
under
his
entire
control
the
mother
possessing
no
authority
over
them
from
that
period
down
to
the
twentieth
century
of
christianity
under
all
changing
civil
laws
woman
has
ever
felt
the
oppressions
of
ecclesiasticism
in
this
relation
guizot
strangely
declares
that
woman
s
present
and
what
he
terms
superior
position
in
the
household
today
is
due
to
feudalism
the
isolation
and
strife
under
which
the
nobility
lived
during
the
feudal
period
warring
against
each
other
when
not
engaged
in
foreign
aggression
compelled
to
certain
forms
of
social
life
within
each
castle
thus
creating
the
modern
family
or
the
family
under
its
present
social
form
at
that
period
the
feudal
wife
with
her
retinue
of
household
serfs
and
a
vast
number
of
her
husband
s
retainers
in
charge
held
a
more
responsible
position
than
that
of
woman
under
primitive
christian
habits
of
life
but
the
knights
and
lords
of
these
feudal
castles
were
lecherous
robbers
rather
than
men
of
kindly
regard
for
womankind
their
inclination
was
not
towards
justice
or
family
life
but
the
despoiling
of
all
beneath
them
and
even
of
their
equals
with
whom
they
were
not
upon
terms
of
amity
the
ruins
of
such
castles
like
the
nest
of
the
eagle
perched
upon
some
inaccessible
rock
add
today
an
element
of
picturesque
beauty
to
the
rhine
and
other
rivers
of
europe
but
owe
their
elevated
and
isolated
positions
of
the
evil
character
of
their
owners
the
banditti
of
the
middle
ages
when
not
engaged
with
their
king
in
warfare
they
made
the
despoiling
of
serfs
and
the
betrayal
of
wives
and
daughters
their
chief
diversion
the
robbery
of
burghers
and
travelers
their
business
churchmen
equally
with
laymen
living
by
the
same
means
during
the
year
rudolph
of
germany
destroyed
castles
of
these
christian
robber
nobility
in
thuringia
alone
and
hung
of
these
family
builders
at
one
time
in
erfurt
he
compared
rome
to
the
lion
s
den
in
fable
the
footsteps
of
many
animals
to
be
found
going
thither
but
none
coming
back
at
this
period
the
soldiers
of
christian
europe
found
pleasure
in
torture
for
its
own
sake
chiefly
selecting
women
as
their
victims
in
mediaeval
england
the
condition
of
woman
was
one
of
deep
degradation
wives
were
bought
and
daughters
sold
for
many
hundred
years
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
although
england
was
christianized
in
the
fourth
century
it
was
not
until
the
tenth
that
the
christian
wife
of
a
christian
husband
acquired
the
right
of
eating
at
table
with
him
nor
until
the
same
century
did
a
daughter
gain
the
right
of
rejecting
the
husband
her
father
might
have
selected
for
her
while
the
sale
of
daughters
was
practiced
in
england
for
seven
hundred
years
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
we
note
that
by
the
ancient
law
of
india
a
father
was
forbidden
to
sell
his
daughter
in
marriage
or
receive
the
smallest
present
therefor
in
mediaeval
england
the
daughter
was
held
as
a
portion
of
the
father
s
property
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
the
mundium
recognized
the
father
s
right
to
sell
his
daughter
to
the
husband
he
might
select
for
her
usually
the
highest
bidder
in
point
of
wealth
or
political
influence
while
marquette
pertained
to
kings
feudal
lords
and
men
of
no
family
relationship
to
the
victim
mundium
inhered
in
the
father
himself
through
it
he
sacrificed
his
own
daughter
for
money
or
power
the
practice
of
buying
wives
with
cattle
or
money
was
regulated
both
in
the
laws
of
king
aethelbert
and
king
ine
in
event
of
the
woman
who
had
been
thus
bought
becoming
a
widow
half
of
the
sum
paid
for
her
seems
to
have
been
set
aside
for
her
support
provided
her
husband
had
not
died
without
issue
the
other
half
remained
absolutely
the
property
of
her
father
brother
or
guardian
by
whom
she
had
been
sold
at
a
somewhat
later
period
the
church
doctrine
of
celibacy
influenced
all
ranks
of
men
while
at
the
same
time
an
unmarried
woman
because
of
her
maidenhood
was
regarded
as
disreputable
a
bachelor
held
honorable
place
even
though
all
celibate
men
were
looked
upon
as
libertines
of
especially
impure
life
warnings
against
matrimony
were
the
ordinary
topics
of
conversation
while
virtue
in
women
was
held
so
little
sacred
that
no
nearness
of
relationship
was
security
for
either
a
married
or
a
single
woman
husbands
trafficked
in
the
honor
of
their
wives
fathers
sold
their
daughters
yet
if
under
temptation
a
woman
fell
outside
of
such
sale
her
punishment
was
most
severe
to
a
husband
was
accorded
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
his
household
and
either
personally
or
by
means
of
a
hired
assassin
he
not
unfrequently
assigned
his
wife
to
death
or
to
a
punishment
more
atrocious
and
barbarous
disraeli
says
if
in
these
ages
of
romance
and
romances
the
fair
sex
were
scarcely
approached
without
the
devotion
of
idolatry
whenever
the
course
of
true
love
altered
when
the
frail
spirit
loved
too
late
and
should
not
have
loved
the
punishment
became
more
criminal
than
the
crime
for
there
was
more
selfish
revenge
and
terrific
malignity
than
of
justice
when
autocratical
man
became
the
executioner
of
his
own
decree
the
english
christian
husband
of
that
age
is
paralleled
by
certain
north
american
indians
of
the
present
day
the
horizon
of
woman
s
life
was
bounded
by
the
wishes
of
her
father
or
husband
single
she
was
regarded
as
a
more
or
less
valuable
piece
of
property
for
whose
sale
the
owner
was
entitled
to
make
as
good
a
bargain
as
possible
it
was
as
a
bride
that
the
greatest
sum
was
secured
prominent
among
the
laws
of
the
first
christian
king
of
kent
were
provisions
for
the
transfer
of
money
or
cattle
in
exchange
for
the
bride
the
theory
of
woman
s
ownership
by
man
was
everywhere
carried
into
practice
and
with
great
severity
in
case
the
wife
proved
unfaithful
to
her
enforced
vows
the
facts
that
her
consent
to
the
marriage
had
not
been
asked
that
mayhap
the
man
she
was
forced
to
wed
was
utterly
repugnant
to
her
that
her
affections
might
already
have
been
bestowed
that
she
was
transferred
like
a
piece
of
goods
with
no
voice
upon
the
question
were
not
taken
into
consideration
and
did
the
husband
not
choose
to
kill
his
derelict
spouse
the
question
still
remained
one
of
property
and
a
new
bride
was
demanded
of
the
lover
in
place
of
the
wife
whose
love
he
had
gained
a
husband
attracted
by
a
new
face
more
wealth
greater
political
influence
or
for
any
reason
desiring
to
be
rid
of
his
wife
was
regarded
as
justifiable
in
hiring
an
assassin
to
strangle
her
or
if
walking
by
a
of
himself
pushing
her
into
the
water
where
her
cries
for
help
were
disregarded
those
in
whose
hearts
pity
rose
were
prevented
from
giving
aid
but
such
remarks
as
it
is
nothing
only
a
woman
being
a
horse
or
other
domestic
animal
received
more
consideration
than
the
women
of
a
household
notwithstanding
this
period
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
before
the
days
of
printing
or
rapid
intercourse
between
nations
yet
the
evil
fame
of
christendom
reached
distant
lands
its
hypocrisy
and
baseness
were
known
by
those
very
saracens
from
whom
the
crusaders
attempted
to
wrest
the
holy
sepulchre
to
sir
john
mandeville
the
sultan
of
egypt
mercilessly
criticized
the
christianity
of
england
and
the
christian
method
of
serving
god
the
total
disregard
of
chastity
the
sale
of
daughters
sisters
and
wives
we
can
not
agree
with
disraeli
in
his
doubts
if
there
was
a
single
christian
in
all
christendom
at
this
period
to
the
contrary
it
may
be
regarded
as
an
epoch
when
the
doctrines
of
christianity
were
most
fully
sustained
the
church
at
that
time
carrying
out
the
principles
of
both
the
old
and
the
new
testament
regarding
women
from
moses
to
paul
the
bible
everywhere
speaks
of
her
as
a
being
made
for
man
secondary
to
man
and
under
his
authority
by
direct
command
of
the
almighty
the
state
as
coadjutor
and
servant
of
the
church
basing
her
codes
of
law
upon
its
teachings
under
these
codes
woman
has
not
only
been
looked
upon
as
naturally
unchaste
but
also
regarded
as
a
liar
the
state
demanding
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
and
in
some
instances
of
seven
women
to
invalidate
that
of
one
man
the
man
even
then
in
extreme
cases
clearing
himself
by
his
single
oath
condemned
as
having
brought
evil
into
the
world
woman
s
every
step
was
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
the
most
brutal
treatment
as
far
short
of
her
just
deserts
to
speak
well
of
her
was
to
cause
misgivings
of
one
s
self
the
system
of
defamation
inaugurated
by
the
church
in
reference
to
women
was
later
recognized
by
the
jesuits
as
a
most
effective
plan
for
the
personal
subjugation
of
men
busenbaum

whenever
you
would
ruin
a
person
you

repetition
and
perseverance

at
length
give
the
consistency
of
probability
and
the
calumnies
will
stick
to
a
distant
day
the
astute
jesuits
learned
their
lesson
from
church
treatment
of
women
its
practical
results
were
ever
before
their
eyes
in
the
contempt
with
which
woman
was
regarded
and
her
own
consequent
loss
of
self
respect
under
early
and
mediaeval
christian
law
as
in
most
states
today
the
father
alone
had
right
to
the
disposal
of
his
children
he
possessed
the
sole
power
of
giving
away
his
daughter
in
marriage
if
he
died
this
right
devolved
upon
the
eldest
son
only
in
case
there
were
no
sons
was
the
right
of
the
mother
in
any
way
recognized
if
neither
father
or
brother
were
living
the
mother
gave
her
daughter
away
in
marriage
and
this
was
the
only
instance
in
which
one
woman
possessed
control
over
another
woman
the
law
allowing
the
mother
no
voice
in
the
marriage
of
her
daughter
unless
she
was
a
widow
without
sons
so
greatly
enslaved
were
daughters
that
of
the
victim
in
no
way
impaired
the
validity
of
the
marriage
a
girl
was
simply
a
piece
of
family
property
to
be
disposed
of
as
the
family
thought
best
although
wives
were
simply
the
slaves
of
husbands
yet
the
condition
of
an
unmarried
woman
was
even
more
deplorable
deprived
of
the
society
of
young
persons
of
her
own
sex
not
allowed
speech
with
any
man
outside
of
her
own
family
she
was
fortunate
if
she
escaped
personal
in
her
father
s
house
not
permitted
to
sit
in
the
presence
of
either
her
father
or
her
mother
continually
found
fault
with
the
laws
constraining
her
to
marry
while
giving
her
no
preference
as
to
a
husband
and
marriage
still
more
fully
taking
from
her
the
control
of
her
own
person
yet
it
was
anxiously
looked
forward
to
as
at
least
a
change
of
masters
and
the
constant
hope
that
in
the
husband
she
might
find
a
lover
who
for
dear
love
s
sake
would
treat
her
with
common
humanity
such
was
the
condition
of
women
during
eighteen
hundred
years
of
christianity
legislated
for
as
slaves
imprisoned
for
crimes
that
if
committed
by
a
man
were
only
punished
by
branding
the
hand
buried
alive
for
other
crimes
that
committed
by
men
were
atoned
for
by
the
payment
of
a
fine
denied
a
share
in
the
government
of
the
family
or
the
church
their
very
sex
deemed
a
curse
the
twentieth
century
is
now
about
to
open
showing
no
truly
enlightened
nation
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
from
the
barbarism
of
inhumanity
the
world
is
slowly
awakening
to
the
fact
that
every
human
being
stands
upon
the
plane
of
equal
natural
rights
the
church
has
not
taught
the
world
this
great
truth
the
state
has
not
conceded
it
its
acknowledgment
thus
far
has
been
due
to
the
teachings
of
individual
men
and
women
that
authority
over
others
a
crime
against
humanity
under
christian
teaching
regarding
woman
the
daughter
was
looked
upon
as
a
more
remote
relative
and
heir
than
the
son
and
this
upon
the
ground
of
her
inferiority
blackstone
although
admitting
that
such
views
did
not
pertain
in
rome
yet
speaks
of
males
as
the
worthier
of
such
views
were
not
held
by
britain
under
common
law
before
that
country
accepted

property
was
equally
divided
between
sisters
and
only
by
special
custom
between
brothers
but
as
early
as
henry
ii
it
was
the
general
rule
that
a
woman
could
not
share
an
inheritance
with
a
man
an
exception
sometimes
existed
in
a
particular
city
where
such
custom
had
long
prevailed
until
quite
recently
english
women
have
not
been
permitted
to
express
an
opinion
upon
political
questions
although
the
primrose
league
and
other
similar
organizations
have
effected
a
great
change
within
a
few
years
yet
it
is
but
little
more
than
two
hundred
years
in
at
a
woman
having
spoken
against
the
taxation
imposed
by
parliament
was
condemned
for
this
freedom
of
political
criticism
to
have
her
tongue
nailed
to
the
body
of
a
tree
at
the
highway
side
upon
a
market
day
and
a
paper
fastened
to
her
back
detailing
the
heinousness
of
her
offense
it
was
thus
the
state
deterred
similar
women
from
the
expression
of
their
views
and
in
line
with
the
church
used
its
most
stringent
measures
to
retain

which
both

and

makes
some
interesting
statements
in

to
the
course
adopted
by
the
natives

to
save
women
from
giving
birth
to
undesired
children
and
to
prevent
the
needless
suffering
and
infant
mortality
so
common
in
christian
lands
among
the
methods
adopted
in
christian
countries
for
a
continuance
of
the
crimes
common
in
the
marriage
relation
have
been
more
or
less
stringent
laws
against
divorce
ever
falling
with
heaviest
force
upon
her
whom
christian
marriage
laws
have
made
a
slave
the
christian
union
declares
as
a
significant
act
of
evil
import
that
in
wyoming
where
the
power
of
woman
in
affairs
of
government
is
greatest
one
divorce
takes
place
in
every
six
marriages
the
proportion
being
greater
than
in
any
other
but
if
this
assertion
of
the
christian
union
is
true
it
is
proof
that
a
share
in
making
the
laws
which
govern
her
is
wisely
used
by
the
women
of
that
state
and
it
marks
a
new
era
in
civilization
when
woman
holding
political
power
in
her
own
hands
refuses
longer
to
degrade
herself
by
living
in
a
relation
that
has
lost
the
binding
power
of
love
the
laws
of
church
and
of
state
during
the
christian
ages
originated
with
man
and
it
is
a
promising
sign
of
woman
s
growth
in
independent
thought
and
purity
of
character
that
she
thus
protests
against
the
bondage
of
a
relation
which
virtually
holds
the
wife
as
slave
of
the
husband
for
despite
the
changes
of
the
last
four
and
a
half
decades
we
still
find
the
general
tone
of
legislation
in
line
with
the
church
teaching
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
to
man
we
still
find
belief
in
the
wife
s
duty
of
obedience
to
the
husband
we
still
discover
the
church
the
state
the
world
all
regarding
the
exercise
of
her
own
judgment
even
upon
the
questions
most
closely
related
to
herself
as
woman
s
greatest
sin
as
free
as
woman
is
called
today
she
has
not
yet
as
daughter
secured
perfect
liberty
of
choice
in
marriage
the
power
of
the
family
too
often
compelling
her
into
a
hated
relation
money
still
leads
parents
to
prefer
one
suitor
above
another
even
in
the
united
states
while
in
many
european
countries
marriages
are
arranged
by
friends
or
through
a
broker
entirely
without
the
girl
s
consent
who
is
frequently
taken
from
a
convent
or
school
to
be
thus
sold
to
some
wealthy
and
perhaps
octogenarian
wooer
who
covets
the
youth
or
beauty
of
the
victim
the
burning
of
twenty
missionaries
in
a
portion
of
savage
africa
a
few
years
since
filled
the
civilized
world
with
horror
but
for
several
hundred
years
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
great
britain
the
penalty
for
simple
theft
by
a
woman
slave
was
burning
alive
and
all
the
other
women
slaves
were
compelled
to
assist
her
upon
such
an
occasion
mentioned
by
pike
eighty
other
women
each
brought
a
log
of
wood
for
the
burning
by
the
old
roman
code
burning
alive
as
a
punishment
was
forbidden
because
of
its
barbarity
but
christianity
reintroduced
it
and
for
long
centuries
after
the
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
that
other
land
aspiring
to
control
of
the
sea
which
proudly
boasts
that
the
sun
never
sets
on
her
possessions
kept
it
in
her
criminal
code
for
the
punishment
of
helpless
women
so
rigorous
was
woman
s
slavery
that
the
friendships
of
women
with
each
other
or
with
men
were
strictly
prohibited
yet
the
deep
affection
of
one
man
for
another
to
whom
he
consecrated
his
life
and
fortune
and
of
whom
he
spoke
with
that
deep
tenderness
was
highly
commended
the
despotic
irresponsible
power
of
husbands
in
christian
england
at
this
period
is
shown
by
the
diverse
manner
in
which
the
murder
of
a
wife
by
a
husband
or
a
husband
by
a
wife
was
regarded
for
husband
to
murder
a
wife
either
by
his
own
hands
or
those
of
a
hired
assassin
was
of
frequent
occurrence
but
as
she
was
his
slave
over
whom
he
had
power
of
life
and
death
this
was
looked
upon
as
a
trivial
affair
but
under
the
laws
of
both
church
and
state
the
murder
of
a
husband
by
a
wife
was
regarded
as
petty
treason
to
be
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
burning
alive
being
a
not
uncommon
form
under
christian
legislation
not
alone
the
wife
s
person
but
her
property
so
fully
became
her
husband
s
that
her
use
of
any
portion
of
it
thereafter
without
his
consent
was
regarded
as
theft
and
such
is
still
the
law
in
the
majority
of
christian
countries
it
is
less
than
sixty
years
since
a
change
in
this
respect
took
place
in
any
part
of
the
christian
world
while
a
wife
may
steal
from
her
husband
it
is
still
the
law
that
a
husband
can
not
steal
from
his
wife
if
she
allows
him
to
transact
business
for
her
or
in
any
way
obtain
possession
of
her
property
even
for
a
moment
he
has
acquired
its
legal
ownership
since
the
passage
of
the
married
woman
s
property
act
the
courts
of
england
have
decided
that
a
husband
can
not
steal
from
his
wife
while
she
is
living
with
him
a
case
before
baron
huddleston
commented
upon
by
the
mall
under
head
of
stealing
from
a
wife
called
attention
to
the
superior
position
of
the
mistress
in
respect
to
property
rights
over
that
of
the
wife
can
a
husband
rob
his
wife
baron
huddleston
yesterday
answered
this
by
saying
he
can
not
rob
her
at
all
under
the
common
law
which
regards
all
the
wife
s
property
as
the
husband
s
and
theft
is
only
robbery
under
the
married
women
s
property
act
when
the
wife
is
living
apart
from
her
husband
or
when
he
is
preparing
to
desert
her
it
is
really
quite
amazing
how
many
advantages
a
mistress
has
over
a
wife
in
all
matters
relating
to
property
and
to
person
it
almost
seems
as
if
the
object
of
the
law
was
to
inflict
such
disabilities
on
wives
in
order
to
induce
the
fair
sex
to
prefer
concubinage
to
matrimony
the
separate
moral
codes
for
man
and
woman
in
all
christian
lands
show
their
evil
aspect
in
many
ways
adultery
in
all
christian
countries
is
held
to
be
less
sinful
for
men
than
for
women
in
england
while
the
husband
can
easily
obtain
a
divorce
from
the
wife
upon
the
ground
of
adultery
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
wife
to
obtain
a
divorce
from
the
husband
upon
the
same
ground
nothing
short
of
the
husband
s
bringing
another
woman
into
the
house
to
sustain
wifely
relations
to
him
at
all
justifies
her
in
proceedings
for
a
separation
and
even
then
the
husband
retains
a
right
to
all
the
wife
s
property
of
which
he
was
in
possession
or
which
may
have
fallen
into
his
hands
less
than
a
dozen
years
since
an
english
husband
willed
his
wife
s
property
to
his
mistress
and
her
children
of
whom
he
was
the
father
the
wife
in
what
is
known
as
the
birchall
case
contested
the
will
but
the
courts
not
only
decided
in
its
favor
but
added
insult
to
that
legal
robbery
by
telling
the
wife
that
a
part
of
her
money
was
enough
for
her
and
that
she
ought
to
be
willing
that
her
husband
s
mistress
and
illegitimate
children
should
share
it
with
her
woman
s
disobedience
to
man
is
regarded
by
both
the
church
and
the
state
as
disobedience
to
god
as
late
as
the
first
half
of
the
present
century
it
was
held
as
constructive
treason
in
england
punishable
by
the
state
for
a
wife
to
refuse
obedience
to
her
husband
s
commands
or
in
any
way
to
question
his
authority
she
was
required
to
be
under
submission
to
him
as
the
direct
representative
of
the
deity
for
the
woman
who
protested
against
this
annihilation
of
her
individuality
a
flogging
was
the
customary
form
of
punishment
and
so
common
was
the
use
of
the
whip
that
its
size
was
regulated
by
law
the
punishment
of
petit
treason
was
more
severe
for
woman
than
for
man
because
her
crime
was
regarded
as
of
a
more
heinous
character
she
was
dragged
on
the
ground
or
pavement
to
the
place
of
execution
then
burned
alive
a
man
was
drawn
and
hanged
it
was
long
after
the
conquest
before
even
a
man
convicted
of
treason
secured
the
right
of
being
carried
to
execution

or
hurdle

comments
upon
the
extreme
torment
of
being
dragged
on
the
ground
or
pavement
in
case
of
a
woman
the
wounds
and
lacerations
thus
received
must
have
greatly
added
to
her
intensity
of
suffering
yet
so
blinded
was
he
through
those
laws
that
he
calls
her
punishment
of
burning
a
tribute
to
the
decency
due
to
the
during
a
portion
of
the
christian
era
the
wife
has
not
been
looked
upon
as
related
to
her
husband
the
residuum
of
this
disbelief
in
the
relationship
of
husband
and
wife
occasionally
shows
itself
to
the
present
day
she
was
his
slave
under
both
religious
and
civil
law
holding
the
same
relations
to
him
as
the
subject
did
to
the
king
and
liable
to
punishments
similar
to
those
inflicted
upon
unruly
slaves
or
disloyal
subjects
rebellion
against
the
husband
s
authority
was
treason
punishable
by
law
similarly
as
treason
to
the
king
the
difference
was
but
in
name
down
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
england
the
wife
who
had
murdered
her
husband
was
burned
alive
if
the
husband
murdered
his
wife
he
suffered
simple
decapitation
the
same
as
if
he
had
murdered
any
other
for
the
wife
s
crime
of
petit
treason
the
penalty
was
that
of
the
slave
who
had
killed
her
master
it
is
scarcely
a
hundred
years
since
the
punishment
of
burning
the
wife
alive
for
the
murder
of
her
husband
or
the
female
slave
for
the
murder
of
her
master
as
petit
treason
passed
out
of
the
english
penal
code
the
last
instance
occurring
in
eight
years
after
our
declaration
of
independence
this
same
code
was
operative
in
the
colonies
the
last
woman
thus
punished
in
this
country
being
a
slave
in
who
had
murdered
her
master
america
having
years
precedence
in
the
abolition
of
this
penalty
a
cablegram
from
europe
september
proves
the
continued
existence
in
this
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
crime
of
petit
treason
and
also
the
barbarous
punishment
still
inflicted
under
christian
law
upon
the
wife
who
murders
her
husband
this
case
occurring
in
finland
was
carried
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
not
only
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
but
decreed
additional
punishment
because
the
wife
had
also
forged
her
husband
s
name
for
small
sums
of
money
having
under
law
first
been
robbed
by
him
of
her
earnings
the
judgment
of
having
her
right
hand
cut
off
was
added
to
the
original
sentence
she
was
then
decapitated
her
body
fastened
to
a
stake
covered
with
inflammable
material
and
burned
to
ashes
although
this
wife
was
not
burned
alive
the
barbarity
of
her
punishment
was
most
atrocious
and
took
place
under
the
christian
laws
of
the
church
and
the
state
in
a
protestant
country
in
the
year
of
our
lord
that
the
punishment
was
infinitely
more
severe
than
would
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
husband
in
case
he
had
murdered
his
wife
was
due
to
christian
teaching
of
woman
s
inferiority
and
subordination
to
man
thus
making
the
wife
s
crime
that
of
petit
treason
under
law
only
a
trifle
less
heinous
than
murdering
a
king
or
attempting
destruction
of
the
government
had
the
husband
murdered
the
wife
it
would
have
been
according
to
legal
prevision
the
same
as
if
he
had
killed
other
the
marriage
ceremony
robbed
her
of
her
property
and
earnings
but
in
equity
the
money
she
was
accused
of
stealing
from
him
belonged
to
her
under
the
laws
of
most
christian
states
a
woman
is
robbed
of
herself
and
all
of
her
possessions
by
the
simple
fact
of
her
marriage
under
christian
laws
the
services
of
the
wife
in
the
marital
relation
are
all
due
to
the
husband
her
earnings
all
belong
to
him
she
is
a
slave
owning
nothing
and
with
no
rights
in
the
property
her
husband
calls
his
own
this
wife
s
crime
was
provoked
by
criminal
legislation
of
the
christian
church
and
state
possessing
no
legal
right
to
the
control
of
her
own
person
property
or
conscience
the
wife
was
held
to
have
sinned
against
a
divinely
appointed
master
to
whom
she
owed
more
than
human
allegiance
she
was
a
criminal
so
great
that
the
punishment
of
severing
her
hand
and
head
were
deemed
entirely
inadequate
and
her
body
fastened
to
a
stake
was
covered
with
inflammable
material
and
burned
to
ashes
while
the
external
government
of
finland
as
declarations
of
war
peace
treaties
is
under
control
of
the
czar
or
grand
duke
yet
in
the
internal
administration
of
affairs
this
country
is
an
independent
state
under
a
constitution
dating
and
confirmed
by
three
successive
czars
it
became
christianized
in
the
twelfth
century
but
is
not
under
the
greek
church
its
established
religion
is
evangelical
and
lutheran
under
control
of
the
archbishop
of
abo
and
the
bishops
of

and
knopo
an
ecclesiastical
assembly
meeting

years
and
the
diet
composed
of
representatives
of

nobility
citizens
and
peasants
every
five

without
consent
of
these
bodies
no
laws
are
enacted
or
repealed
but
woman
possesses
no
representation
either
in
ecclesiastical
or
civil
affairs
the
old
law
of
marriage
instituted
by
the
church
which
held
the
wife
as
belonging
body
and
soul
to
the
husband
who
not
alone
possessed
control
over
her
actions
but
decided
her
religion
is
still
extant
in
but
few
countries
do
we
see
a
tendency
towards
its
abolition
even
those
that
have
somewhat
favorably
legislated
upon
the
question
still
retaining
the
general
principle
of
a
wife
s
subserviency
to
her
husband
a
few
years
since
an
english
lady
desirous
of
uniting
with
the
catholic
church
was
refused
consent
by
her
husband
a
staunch
unknown
to
him
she
was
received
into
that
body
which
proved
occasion
of
an
animated
controversy
between
the
husband
and
the
late
cardinal
manning
the
former
basing
his
opposition
and
his
letter
of
remonstrance
to
the
cardinal
upon
the
ground
of
the
admitted
legal
right
of
a
husband
under
english
law
to
ordain
the
form
of
his
wife
s
religion
nor
do
we
find
material
difference
in
the
united
states
in
virginia
in
the
winter
of
a
wife
despite
the
opposition
of
her
husband
caused
her
infant
to
be
baptized
by
an
episcopal
clergyman
into
that
church
the
husband
openly
expressing
his
disapproval
while
the
ceremony
was
in
progress
and
afterwards
suing
the
clergyman
for
an
interference
with
his
vested
rights
over
wife
and
child
this
supreme
authority
of
the
husband
in
christian
countries
is
shown
in
many
strange
ways
among
the
hindoos
the
naming
of
the
child
belongs
to
the
mother
if
the
father
expresses
desire
for
a
different
name
each
one
is
written
upon
a
paper
over
which
lighted
lamps
are
set
the
one
burning
the
longest
deciding
the
choice
of

but
in

to
the
naming
of
a
child
was
settled
by
law
the
father
and
mother
each
filed
a
certificate
with
the
registrar
the
father
employing
a
lawyer
who
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
city
solicitor
proved
his
client
s
prior
right
and
an
order
was
issued
to
the
registrar
in
favor
of
the
father
s
choice
of
name
the
claim
of
the
christian
husband
in
each
of
these
instances
was
that
of
his
supreme
and
prior
right
on
the
church
theory
incorporated
into
law
that
both
wife
and
child
belong
to
the
husband
the
celebrated
case
in
england
during
the
latter
part
of
the
seventies
was
brought
by
a
wife
to
compel
the
keeping
by
a
husband
of
his
pledges
in
regard
to
the
religious
education
of
his
children
the
decision
was
against
the
wife
upon
the
general
ground
that
a
wife
had
no
rights
in
law
as
against
a
husband
a
man
s
pledged
word
broken
at
the
gaming
table
renders
him
infamous
and
subjects
him
to
dishonor
through
life
but
a
husband
s
pledged
word
broken
to
his
wife
under
ruling
of
the
highest
court
and
the
profoundest
legal
talent
of
england
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
is
just
implying
no
dishonor
but
rather
entitling
him
to
respect
as
a
man
who
in
a
befitting
manner
has
maintained
his
marital
rights
and
authority
the
judge
instructed
the
wife
that
she
had
no
right
to
teach
her
children
what
her
husband
did
not
believe
even
though
she
herself
most
fully
believed
what
she
taught
he
impressed
upon
her
that
she
was
not
rearing
her
children
for
herself
but
as
her
husband
s
property
over
which
she
possessed
no
control
only
in
so
far
as
the
husband
made
her
his
agent
in
affirming
the
order
of
the
the
court
of
appeals
declared
that
the
father
had
the
legal
right
to
bring
up
the
children
in
his
own
faith
and
in
pledging
his
word
to
the
contrary
he
had
in
no
way
forfeited
or
abandoned
his
authority
this
decision
of
the
english
court
of
appeals
is
in
accord
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
the
albany
in
commenting
upon
this
case
under
the
head
of
curious
question
declared
the
decision
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
general
rule
as
to
religious
education
the
child
is
to
be
educated
in
the
religion
of
the
father
the
women
s
suffrage
in
its
comments
declared
english
law
to
be
based
upon
the
koran
quoting
in
proof
from
a
writer
in
the
contemporary
review
the
east
has
long
been
noted
for
the
subordination
of
its
women
and
this
subjection
is
not
only
preached
by
mussulmans
and
buddhists
but
even
by
christian
churches
woman
is
not
regarded
as
a
person
but
as
a
field
cultivable
or
not
as
the
possessor
desires
as
a
field
can
neither
have
faith
nor
intellect
nor
a
will
of
its
own
it
would
be
absurd
for
a
man
to
occupy
himself
about
what
a
woman
believes
thinks
or
wishes
she
is
absolutely
nothing
but
her
husband
s
domain
he
cultivates
it
and
reaps
the
harvest
for
the
harvest
belongs
to
the
proprietor
according
to
the
s
suffrage
this
condition
accurately
depicted
the
spirit
of
the
injunction
laid
upon
by
lord
justice
james
to
the
wife
and
mother
he
declared
that
she
had
no
right
to
teach
her
children
what
she
believed
but
must
to
the
contrary
teach
them
what
her
husband
believed
whether
she
believed
it
or
not
the
law
not
concerning
itself
with
what
a
woman
believes
or
wishes
as
she
is
in
law
absolutely
nothing
but
her
husband
s
domain
the
mistake
of
the
lies
in
ascribing
this
law
to
the
teachings
of
the
koran
instead
of
the
teachings
of
the
bible
which
in
general
tone
and
through
particular
instruction
places
woman
upon
the
same
level
as
a
man
s
flocks
and
herds
oxen
and
we
do
not
find
the
personal
rights
of
women
in
the
united
states
differing
from
those
of
the
women
of
england
a
famous
suit
was
tried
in
ohio
known
as
the
lucy
walker
case
a
former
wife
suing
the
present
wife
for
alienating
her
husband
s
affections
great
attention
was
called
to
this
suit
from
the
high
position
of
the
parties
judge
seney
former
husband
of
one
and
present
husband
of
the
other
wife
being
widely
known
as
author
of
a
civil
code
bearing
his
name
the
suit
gained
still
greater
notoriety
from
the
principle
enunciated
in
his
decision
rendered
against
the
plaintiff
by
judge
dodge
before
whom
the
case
came
to
trial
he
dismissed
it
upon
the
ground
that
a
wife
had
no
rights
as
against
her
husband
all
testimony
upon
part
of
the
injured
first
wife
was
excluded
upon
the
same
ground
he
decided
first
that
the
husband
has
a
property
interest
in
his
wife
which
the
wife
does
not
possess
in
the
husband
second
that
the
law
protects
him
in
this
right
of
property
in
her
third
upon
the
ground
that
he
holds
her
and
dares
the
world
to
meddle
with
him
in
the
holding
fourth
but
on
the
contrary
the
wife
looks
alone
to
the
husband
the
law
compelling
her
to
do
so
thus
less
than
fifteen
years
since
the
legal
decision
was
rendered
in
the
united
states
that
a
wife
is
a
husband
s
property
that
the
husband
has
a
pecuniary
interest
in
the
wife
the
law
protecting
his
right
of
property
in
her
while
the
wife
possesses
no
reciprocal
right
of
property
in
the
husband
the
gave
the
full
text
of
judge
dodge
s
decision
the
question
submitted
in
this
has
a
wife
such
a
property
in
her
husband
has
she
such
a
legal
pecuniary
interest
in
him
that
she
can
bring
an
action
at
law
against
one
who
injures
him
against
one
who
imprisons
him
and
finally
can
a
wife
recover
damages
at
law
against
a
woman
who
has
carnal
intercourse
with
her
husband
without
her
consent
it
will
be
at
once
admitted
that
the
question
is
a
novel
one
our
courts
adjudicate
primarily
upon
property
interests
a
husband
has
a
pecuniary
a
property
interest
in
his
wife
the
law
protects
this
right
of
property
a
father
can
recover
damages
against
a
man
who
seduces
his
daughter
but
a
mother
can
not
recover
for
the
seduction
of
a
daughter
why
not
is
she
not
as
dear
to
the
mother
as
the
father
nay
dearer
by
as
much
as
a
mother
s
love
exceeds
a
father
s
but
she
has
not
property
in
her
is
not
entitled
to
her
wages
neither
is
a
mother
bound
to
support
her
children
the
father
is
the
head
of
the
family
not
the
mother
he
by
virtue
of
his
headship
is
legally
entitled
to
the
services
of
his
family
the
husband
is
head
of
the
wife
not
the
wife
of
the
husband
but
can
a
husband
sue
his
wife
if
she
refuses
to
support
him
out
of
her
property
to
give
him
her
earnings
or
keep
her
marriage
contract
not
at
all
can
a
father
sue
his
minor
child
that
refuses
him
obedience
and
service
not
at
all
and
why
is
this
for
the
same
reason
that
he
can
not
sue
his
flocks
or
his
herds
his
oxen
and
his
are
his
his
to
command
he
is
responsible
for
and
to
them
he
can
not
sue
his
own
he
can
sue
any
one
who
takes
them
away
any
one
who
keeps
or
harbors
them
any
one
who
injures
them
because
they
are
his
own
but
the
wife
does
not
own
her
husband
the
child
does
not
own
the
father
and
therefore
i
hold
that
the
child
can
not
sue
for
an
injury
to
the
father
nor
the
wife
for
an
injury
to
the
husband
there
is
in
her
no
property
right
upon
which
to
found
the
action
my
conviction
is
that
the
wife
looks
to
her
husband
alone
for
the
fulfillment
of
his
marriage
vows
if
he
refuses
her
the
support
protection
and
love
which
he
pledged
her
she
applies
to
a
court
to
enforce
the
claim
against
him
every
dollar
he
has
every
penny
of
his
earnings
all
his
arm
can
gain
or
his
intellect
can
attain
are
subject
to
her
right
but
she
looks
to
her
husband
alone
the
law
compels
her
to
do
so
the
husband
enforces
his
claim
to
his
wife
by
striking
down
every
one
who
interferes
with
his
right
to
her
he
holds
her
and
dares
the
world
to
meddle
with
her
the
law
protects
him
in
holding
the
law
gives
courage
to
his
heart
strength
to
his
arm
in
defending
his
position
but
the
wife
looks
to
the
husband
she
relies
upon
his
pledge
and
his
promise
which
the
law
will
enforce
and
she
looks
to
that
alone
the
law
does
not
permit
her
to
go
forth
to
smite
the
seducer
of
her
husband
nor
the
man
or
woman
who
entices
him
away
but
as
showing
the
rapid
growth
of
public
opinion
in
favor
of
the
wife
s
equality
of
right
with
the
husband
through
the
persistent
rebellion
of
woman
against
established
laws
and
usages
of
church
and
states
thus
forcing
an
advancing
civilization
upon
the
world
was
a
decision
rendered
twelve
years
later
in
the
state
of
indiana
the
case
was
that
of
leah
haynes
plaintiff
against
flora
knowles
defendant
a
suit
similar
in
character
to
the
lucy
walker
judge
elliot
in
supreme
court
of
that
state
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
dearborn
county
reversed
the
finding
of
the
lower
court
deciding
in
favor
of
the
right
of
a
wife
to
sue
for
the
alienation
of
her
husband
s
affections
this
decision
so
contrary
to
common
law
and
to
ordinary
christian
legislation
for
woman
is
proof
of
an
advancing
civilization
which
does
not
look
to
the
church
for
approval
court
decisions
of
this
character
establishing
a
precedent
are
of
far
greater
value
in
demonstrating
the
growth
of
a
purer
public
sentiment
than
are
simple
legislative
victories
upon
school
or
municipal
questions
they
speak
even
more
clearly
than
do
the
host
of
newly
opened
industries
freer
opportunities
for
education
married
woman
s
property
laws
and
similar
legislation
of
a
growing
recognition
of
woman
s
personal
rights
and
of
a
civilization
founded
upon
the
common
rights
of
humanity
and
no
longer
upon
church
authority
the
general
spirit
and
letter
of
the
christian
laws

benjamin
davenport
the
divorce
suit
showed
the
married
pair
to
have
been
separated
once
before
davenport
unable
to
bear
her
husband
s
tyranny
returning
to
her
mother
s
house
at
that
time
her
husband
required
her
to
eat
only
what
he
directed
and
to
wear
only
those
clothes
he
bade
her
wear
selecting
even
the
color
of
her
ribbons
the
only
fault
he
had
to
find
with
her
was
that
she
talked
back
which
has
always
been
deemed
an
unpardonable
crime
in
woman
one
for
which
the
ducking
stool
and
scold
s
bridle
were
invented
after
she
left
him
davenport
wrote
affectionate
letters
to
his
wife
calling
her
the
sweetest
and
best
of
women
imploring
her
to
return
she
relented
and
lived
with
him
once
more
but
her
husband
again
put
his
rules
in
force
she
then
sued
for
a
divorce
which
the
court
granted
davenport
s
treatment
of
his
wife
is
by
no
means
exceptional
the
following
excerpt
is
from
a
letter
in
the
terra
haute
an
individual
who
considers
himself
a
representative
man
in
the
city
and
perhaps
he
is
said
in
the
presence
of
several
persons
i
went
home
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
and
found
my
wife
sitting
up
she
burst
into
tears
and
asked
me
where
i
had
been
and
why
i
treated
her
in
that
manner
i
just
told
her
if
she
said
another
word
i
would
leave
the
house
that
as
long
as
she
had
a
comfortable
home
where
she
could
spend
her
evenings
it
was
none
of
her
business
where
i
spent
mine
now
if
i
did
not
provide
for
my
family
it
would
be
a
different
thing
but
so
long
as
my
wife
is
well
provided
for
she
has
no
right
to
complain
and
i
don
t
propose
to
allow
these
are
the
man
s
own
words
and
there
are
a
great
many
men
who
hold
the
same
opinions
if
their
wives
protest
because
they
drink
gamble
and
spend
their
nights
away
they
say
you
have
a
good
home
and
enough
to
eat
and
wear
what
more
do
you
want
a
lady
of
richmond
anxious
to
know
from
a
legal
source
just
what
her
rights
as
a
wife
were
consulted
a
lawyer
of
that
city
well
madam
he
replied
head
thrown
back
thumbs
in
armholes
well
madam
you
have
a
right
to
comfortable
food
a
fire
to
keep
you
warm
and
two
calico
dresses
a
year
these
are
your
legal
rights
all
beyond
these
are
the
gifts
of
your
husband
luxuries
of
food
and
clothing
journies
and
books
these
are
not
yours
by
law
it
remains
with
your
husband
to
decide
whether
he
will
furnish
them
to
you
or
and
this
is
christian
civilization
for
woman
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
this
era
although
married
women
of
the
state
of
new
york
have
enjoyed
certain
property
rights
since
subsequent
legislation
in
various
ways
increasing
that
power
it
was
not
until
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
them
to
be
the
rightful
owners
of
articles
of
personal
adornment
and
convenience
coming
from
their
husbands
possessing
power
to
bequeath
them
at
death
to
their
heirs
the
same
year
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
decided
that
a
wife
may
sue
her
husband
for
damages
for
assault
and
battery
the
influence
of
these
decisions
in
recognizing
woman
s
rights
of
person
especially
that
of
the
supreme
court
in
deciding
the
right
of
the
wife
to
punish
the
husband
through
the
courts
for
brutal
treatment
can
scarcely
be
overestimated
it
opened
a
new
era
for
woman
first
a
recognition
of
the
wife
s
personality
second
holding
the
husband
responsible
for
his
treatment
of
the
wife
third
an
acknowledgement
of
the
wife

in

as
possessing

of

making
pretense
of

freedom
in

and
in
reality
according
it
to
men
of
every
color
and
degree
of

or

still
denies
such
liberty
to
woman
in
many
of
the
states
the
old
restrictions
of
modern
common
law
still
prevail
there
are
states
where
the
property
of
the

upon

falls
into
the
control
of
the

to

as
he
alone
pleases

in
those

the
control
of
this

is
in

still

can
not
make
a

can
not
act

can
neither

nor
be

in

the

still
has
the

in

of

has
the

barbarism

that
even
in

within
eight
years
of

we
find
the

the

there
is

the

the

she
has

more
than

her
personal

and
she
renders
a
strict
account
of
stewardship
either
weekly
or

the

s
personal

are
less
much
less
than
the

s
in
many
instances
he
will
spend
more
on

than

for
the
rule
is
the
englishman
is

and
the
english

is
the
worst
dressed
in
the
civilized

the

the

possessing

what
is
the
condition
of
the
wife
in
england
today
but
one
of
degraded
slavery
that
every
woman
does
not
endure
all
these
wrongs
is
simply
because
she
has
a
lenient
master
like
adolph
under
clair
in
tom
s
she
has
freedom
because
a
good
master
allows
her
to
take
it
under
a
bad
master
she
suffers
as
adolph
when
falling
into
the
hands
of
legree
personal

are
the
basis
of
all

personal
slavery
is
the
root
of
all
other
wrongs
neither
freedom

can
exist
without
freedom
of

thus
civilization
has
not

existed
that
which
has
borne
the

the
thought
of
the

the
civilization
of
the

is
not
enlightened
it
belongs
to
the
barbarous
ages
authority
and
not
justice
is
the
rule
to
the
present
time
the
lenient
sentence
imposed
upon
the
english
husband
who
beats
his
wife
is
such
as
to
invite
a
repetition
of
the
offense
knocking
a
wife
down
beating
and
bruising
her
with
a
poker
are
rights
secured
to
the
husband
under

english
law
a
man
named
hefferon
at
rotherham
finding
his
wife
had
gone
to
some
place
of
which
he
disapproved
knocked
her
down
and
beat
her
violently
with
a
poker
she
bled
from
both
ears
her
throat
was
scratched
and
she
was
badly
bruised
on
her
back
and
arms
justice
day
practically
told
the
jury
to
acquit
he
said
the
case
ought
not
to
have
come
before
them
and
he
suggested
that
the
prisoner
had
been
merely
exercising
that
control
over
his
wife
which
was
still
sanctioned
by
the
law
of
england
the
jury
acquitted
promptly
as
directed
to
such
extent
is
this
abuse
of
woman
under
law
as
to
have
called
forth
a
vigorous
article
in
the
under
head
of
the
law
in
relation
to
there
is
another
cruel
injustice
to
woman
which
is
so
notorious
as
to
have
become
a
mere
truism
it
is
referred
to
almost
daily
yet
familiarity
has
bred
such
contempt
that
it
goes
on
unchecked
and
unabated
we
refer
to
the
monstrously
lenient
sentences
passed
upon
husbands
who
assault
and
beat
their
wives
in
one
of
our
criminals
courts
recently
two
men
and
a
woman
were
sentenced
to
six
years
penal
servitude
for
stealing
a
watch
by
force
while
a
man
who
assaulted
and
grievously
wounded
his
wife
and
with
a
reaping
hook
got
eighteen
months
imprisonment
an
instance
occurred
the
other
day
in
a
small
municipal
court
a
man
pleaded
guilty
to
assaulting
and
kicking
his
wife
and
another
woman
with
effusion
of
blood
and
injury
to
their
persons
he
was
fined
a
pound
for
each
female
shortly
after
two
men
were
convicted
of
injuring
public
seats
belonging
to
the
municipality
by
knocking
them
about
they
were
fined
two
pounds
each
clearly
therefore
in
the
eyes
of
this
magistrate
a
municipal
seat
is
worth
exactly
twice
the
value
of
a
woman
parallel
sentences
to
these
may
be
seen
almost
daily
in
the
newspapers
in
any
part
of
the
united
kingdom
in
the
police
courts
often
get
off
with
a
few
days
imprisonment
sometimes
with
an
admonition
if
it
be
argued
that
theft
is
such
a
common
offense
that
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
punished
with
greater
severity
than
cruelty
we
rejoice
that
the
argument
applies
quite
as
forcibly
to
which
unfortunately
is
as
common
an
offence
as
can
be
found
among
a
certain
class
of
society
the
comparison
here
shown
between
the
penalty
of
criminally
assaulting
and
wounding
women
not
alone
the
man
s
wife
but
also
her
aged
mother
most
forcibly
shows
the
entire
disregard
of
christian
england
in
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
the
personal
rights
of
all
women
no
proof
is
needed
other
than
such
decisions
nor
is
the
united
states
far
in
advance
within
ten
months
from
the
formation
of
the
protective
agency
for
women
and
children
organized
in
chicago
april
it
had
investigated
nearly
one
hundred
complaints
although
in
a
majority
of
these
cases
the
agency
was
successful
in
securing
redress
it
yet
found
there
was
not
legal
remedy
where
the
husband
and
father
failed
to
provide
for
his
family
and
that
in
cases
of
crimes
against
women
its
efforts
were
crippled
by
the
disposition
of
police
justices
to
regard
such
crimes
as
venial
offenses
either
dismissing
such
cases
upon
frivolous
pretexts
or
imposing
light
sentences
nothing
could
more
clearly
demonstrate
women
s
degraded
condition
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
christian
civilization
than
the
almost
universal
demand
for
laws
securing
better
protection
to
women
and
children
these
two
classes
unrecognized
by
church
or
state
are
still
largely
without
that
pale
of
protection
man
has
reared
for
himself
january
the
gave
more
than
six
columns
to
an
account
of
the
dreadful
crimes
committed
against
women
and
children
in
chicago
alone
within
the
short
period
of
the
preceding
four
months
it
also
showed
the
ease
with
which
criminals
of
that
class
escaped
punishment
not
alone
from
laxity
of
protective
legislation
for
their
victims
but
still
more
from
the
tendency
of
magistrates
to
ignore
crimes
perpetrated
by
men
against
women
this
condition
being
the
natural
result
of
the
teaching
of
the
church
in
regard
to
woman
in
the
city
of
boston
the
chief
of
police
testified
that
there
were
at
least
fifteen
cases
of
brutal
in
that
city
every
week
and
this
is
but
one
type
of
the
injuries
perpetrated
upon
women
for
which
the
teachings
of
christianity
are
directly
responsible
so
common
this
crime
and
so
ineffective
all
efforts
to
stop
it
that
the
state
of
delaware
has
the
long
abolished
for
offenders
of
this
character
thus
acknowledging
christian
civilization
to
be
a
failure
and
resorting
to
the
retributive
punishment
common
among
barbarians
but
the
remedy
for
crimes
against
women
and
for
the
indifference
of
magistrates
does
not
lie
in
the
punishment
of
the
offenders
but
in
different
sentiments
in
regard
to
woman
in
both
church
and
state
their
teachings
are
the
real
foundations
of
the
evil
within
the
past
ten
years
the
judge
of
an
english
court
decided
that
the
flogging
of
a
wife
in
the
presence
of
her
son
did
not
constitute
cruelty
sustaining
his
decision
by
reference
to
blackstone
and
other
learned
christian
jurists
it
was
during
that
same
year
that
the
chief
of
the
boston
police
testified
to
the
many
cases
of
brutal
wife
beating
in
that
athens
of
america
every
week
so
common
this
form
of
assault

a
bill
was
introduced
in

massachusetts
lower
house
for
the
punishment
of
wife
beaters
by
a
public
whipping
of
not
less
than
ten
or
more
than
thirty
lashes
for
those
refractory
wives
of
mediaeval
christian
england
whom
whippings
failed
to
subdue

punishments

invented

as

known
as

painful

makes
us
acquainted
with
the
various
methods
in
use
for
punishing
the
free
speech
of
women
in
this
country
two
hundred
years
since
a
law
to
punish
babbling
women
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
whereas
many
babbling
women
slander
and
scandalize
their
neighbors
for
which
their
poor
husbands
are
often
involved
in
chargable
and
vexatious
suits

cost
in
great
damages

it
therefore
enacted
by
the
authority
aforesaid
that
in
actions
of
slander
caused
by
the
wife
after
judgment
passed
for
damages
the
wife
shall
be
punished
by
ducking
and
if
the
slander
be
so
enormous
as
to
be
judged
at
greater
damages
than
lbs
of
tobacco
then
the
wife
to
suffer
ducking
for
each
pounds
of
tobacco
adjudged
against
the
husband
if
he
refuses
to
pay
the
tobacco
as
this
was
the
state
in
which
wives
were
bought
in
exchange
for
tobacco
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
the
penalty
of
her
free
speech
to
be
paid
in
tobacco
the
wife
to
suffer
ducking
for
each
pounds
penalty
in
excess
of
the
first
massachusetts
was
not
long
in
following
the
example
of
virginia
and
in
ten
years
later
passed
a
law
for
the
punishment
of
scolds
in
massachusetts
whereas
there
is
no
express
punishment
by
law
hitherto
established
affixed
to
the
evil
practice
of
sundry
persons
by
exhorbitancy
of
tongue
in
reviling
and
scolding
it
is
therefore
ordered
that
all
such
persons
convicted
before
any
court
or
magistrate
that
hath
proper
cognizance
of
the
case
shall
be
gagged
set
in
a
ducking
stool
and
dipped
over
head
and
ears
three
times
in
some
convenient
place
of
fresh
or
salt
water
as
the
court
or
magistrate
shall
judge
meet
nor
must
we
believe
that
the
punishment
of
women
for
use
of
the
tongue
is
of
past
ages
even
in
the
united
states
women
are
to
this
day
sometimes
arraigned
for
free
speaking
laws
to
punish
babbling
women
enacted
in
colonial
days
are
still
in
force
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
a
woman
of
louis
was
arrested
and
brought
before
a
magistrate
as
a
common
scold
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
a
woman
was
brought
before
the
courts
convicted
on
the
old
grounds
of
being
a
common
scold
and
fined
and
costs
death
not
infrequently
accompanied
the
use
of
the
ducking
stool
the
poor
gagged
victim
her
hands
securely
fastened
being
utterly
unable
to
help
herself
but
we
do
not
learn
that
either
the
magistrate
or
the
husband
was
held
responsible
to
the
law
for
such
death
the
sufferers
like
those
under
the
catholic
inquisition
of
the
fourteenth
century
were
deemed
outside
of
the
pale
of
sympathy
or
human
rights
and
the
devils
depicted
upon
the
back
of
ducking
stools
as
laying
hold
of
their
victims
were
conceded
to
have
but
taken
their
rightful
prey
such
has
been
part
of
christian
legislation
for
women
in
america
and
yet
she
is
told
to
see
how
much
christianity
has
done
for
her
to
such
extent
has
this
church
doctrine
of
man
s
superiority
to
woman
and
the
right
of
the
husband
to
control
of
the
wife
proceeded
that
many
husbands
believe
they
possess
the
right
to
sell
their
wives
since
the
reformation
her
sale
in
the
as
an
animal
held
by
a
halter
about
her
waist
has
been
recognized
by
english
law
even
as
late
as
the
present
century
although
now
forbidden
the
practice
of
is
still
occasionally
found
both
in
england
and
in
america
but
when
the
law
takes
cognizance
of
such
a
sale
its
penalty
is
visited
upon
the
innocent
wife
and
not
upon
the
guilty
husband
the
women
s
suffrage
of
december
reported
such
a
case
november
betsy
wardle
was
indicted
for
having
on
the
of
september
married
george
chusmall
her
former
husband
being
alive
the
prisoner
pleaded
guilty
but
said
her
former
husband
gave
her
no
peace
and
sold
her
for
a
quart
of
beer
she
imagined
this
was
a
legal
transaction
and
that
she
could
marry
again
the
second
husband
was
asked
how
he
came
to
marry
the
prisoner
he
answered
well
i
bout
the
judge
said
you
are
not
fool
enough
to
suppose
you
can
buy
another
man
s
wife
on
which
he
replied
i
mr
swift
asked
his
lordship
not
to
pass
a
severe
sentence
the
prisoner
imagined
that
because
she
had
been
sold
for
sixpence
there
was
nothing
criminal
in
marrying
again
his
lordship
said
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
pass
some
punishment
on
to
teach
her
that
a
had
no
more
right
to
sell
his
own
wife
than
his
neighbor
s
wife
or
cow
or
ox
or
ass
or
anything
that
was
his
the
reason
given
by
the
judge
for
punishing
the
woman
is
extremely
suggestive
of
woman
s
condition
under
the
law
the
wife
who
had
been
sold
the
innocent
victim
of
this
masculine
transaction
was
sentenced
to
a
week
s
imprisonment
with
hard
labor
while
the
man
who
sold
her
and
the
man
who
bought
her
escaped
without
punishment
or
censure
the
judge
in
quoting
the
tenth
commandment
graded
the
wife
with
the
ox
and
the
ass
in
the
belongings
of
a
man
the
decision
thus
ranking
her
with
the
cattle
of
the
stable
to
add
to
the
infamy
of
the
trial
it
was
the
occasion
of
much
unseemly
jesting
and
laughter
it
took
place
at
the
liverpool
assizes
before
justice
denham
his
judgement
paralleled
the
decision
of
the
seney
trial
in
ohio
the
selling
a
wife
as
a
cow
in
the
market
place
was
by
no
means
uncommon
during
the
early
part
of
the
century
in
england
ashton
give
numerous
instances
of
such
sales
the
laws
of
england
are
those
of
christianity
based
upon
the
theological
teaching
of
man
s
superiority
over
woman
she
is
his
servant
subordinate
to
him
in
all
things
a
condition
except
where
removed
by
special
statute
existing
today
returned
missionaries
who
refer
to
the
wife
as
waiting
upon
the
husband
at
table
in
heathen
countries
not
eating
until
he
is
satisfied
as
proof
of
the
different
customs
brought
about
by
christianity
should
inform
themselves
of
the
condition
of
the
christian
wife
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
in
what
is
regarded
as
the
foremost
christian
country
in
the
world
he
will
then
have
learned
that
circumstances
quite
contradictory
to
ecclesiasticism
finally
permitted
the
english
wife
to
assume
a
seat
at
the
table
with
her
husband
a
place
she
was
not
allowed
to
take
for
many
hundred
years
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
into
that
island
in
every
country
where
christianity
exists
women
now
are
and
during
all
the
years
of
its
civil
power
have
been
legislated
for
as
slaves
they
have
been
imprisoned
for
crimes
which
if
committed
by
a
man
were
punished
by
simply
branding
on
the
hand
they
have
been
condemned
to
be
buried
alive
for
other
crimes
which
if
committed
by
a
man
were
atoned
for
by
the
payment
of
a
fine
having
first
robbed
woman
of
her
property
and
denied
her
the
control
of
her
own
earnings
the
christian
religion
allowed
her
to
suffer
the
most
agonizing
form
of
death
a
living
burial
for
lack
of
that
very
money
of
which
she
had
been
civilly
and
ecclesiastically
robbed
the
law
so
far
controlled
family
life
that
for
many
hundred
years
it
bound
to
servile
labor
all
unmarried
women
between
the
ages
of
eleven
and
forty
the
father
possessed
absolute
control
over
the
marital
destiny
of
his
daughter
instances
of
wife
sale
are
not
uncommon
in
the
united
states
and
although
the
price
is
usually
higher
than
that
given
for
english
wives
reaching
from
three
hundred
to
four
thousand
dollars
still
as
low
a
sum
as
five
cents
has
been
recorded
a
prosperous
resident
of
black
hills
dakota
is
said
to
have
begun
his
business
start
in
life
through
sale
of
his
wife
if
a
wife
is
a
husband
s
property
the
same
as
a
cow
it
is
manifestly
unjust
that
legal
punishment
of
any
kind
should
fall
upon
her
because
of
her
master
s
action
she
is
irresponsible
the
right
of
sale
logically
goes
with
the
right
of
beating
of
taking
the
wife
s
property
and
holding
her
earnings
of
owning
her
children
and
she
should
be
exempt
from
punishment
for
her
own
sale
in
a
much
larger
measure
we
find
the
same
rule
of
punishing
wives
for
the
crimes
of
husbands
enforced
in
the
united
states
in
the
penalty
of
disfranchisement
of
the
women
of
utah
for
the
polygamy
of
the
men
of
utah
and
this
penalty
was
extended
not
alone
to
the
wives
of
polygamous
possessing
but
one
alike
of
church
and
state
but
the
or
gentile
women
of
that
territory
were
also
disfranchised
by
the
xlix
congress
of
the
united
states
because
of
the
polygamy
of
a
portion
of
the
mormon
men
all
women
of
that
territory
were
deprived
of
their
vested
rights
rights
that
had
been
in
existence
for
seventeen
years
because
of
the
crimes
of
men
against
this
injustice
the
woman
suffragists
of
the
country
protested
through
means
of
a
committee
in
a
memorial
the
president
of
the
united
the
national
woman
suffrage
association
through
this
committee
respectfully
present
to
you
a
protest
against
that
clause
of
the
measure
passed
by
congress
which
whether
in
the
edmunds
bill
of
the
senate
or
the
tucker
substitute
of
the
house
disfranchises
the
women
of
utah
the
clause
relating
to
the
disfranchisement
of
women
has
no
bearing
on
the
general
merits
of
the
end
sought
to
be
attained
by
the
measure
since
mormon
men
are
the
majority
of
the
voters
of
the
territory
the
women
of
utah
have
committed
no
crime
disfranchisement
is
reserved
by
the
united
states
government
for
arch
traitors
justice
forbids
that
such
a
penalty
should
be
inflicted
on
innocent
women
mormon
women
and
the
christian
women
of
utah
being
thus
former
for
their
opinions
and
the
latter
for
the
opinions
of
the
precedent
is
established
subversive
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
our
government
and
threatening
the
security
of
all
citizens
if
congress
deems
it
necessary
to
disfranchise
citizens
because
of
injurious
beliefs
discrimination
between
sexes
is
manifestly
unjust
it
has
been
held
by
the
foremost
statesmen
of
the
nation
that
the
right
of
suffrage
once
exercised
becomes
a
vested
right
which
can
not
be
taken
away
gratz
brown
once
said
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
that
if
the
idea
that
suffrage
could
be
taken
away
at
pleasure
once
crystallized
in
the
minds
of
the
people
it
would
ring
the
death
knell
of
american
vest
of
missouri
on
the
day
of
this
month
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
suffrage
once
given
can
never
be
taken
away
legislatures
and
conventions
may
do
everything
else
they
never
can
do
that
when
any
particular
class
or
fraction
of
the
community
is
once
invested
with
this
privilege
it
is
fixed
accomplished
and
thus
every
argument
for
justice
equal
legislation
and
the
safety
of
our
republican
form
of
government
calls
for
the
defeat
of
this
clause
we
therefore
respectfully
urge
you
as
guardian
of
the
rights
of
all
american
citizens
to
veto
any
measure
coming
before
you
which
disfranchises

women

this
memorial
supplemented
by
personal
argument
from
the
committee
demonstrating
the
political
dangers
connected
with
such
a
denial
of
vested
rights
together
with
the
greater
injustice
of
punishing
women
for
the
crimes
of
men
was
met
by
reply
of
the
president
that
as
great
changes
were
frequently
made
in
bills
before
their
final
passage
he
had
as
yet
not
given
the
subject
much
thought
promising
however
to
give
it
his
fullest
attention
whenever
brought
before
him
the
method
taken
by
the
president
to
avoid
responsibility
of
decision
is
notable
as
he
neither
signed
nor
vetoed
the
bill
but
allowed
it
to
become
law
through
such
crimes
of
omission
being
parallel
with
those
of
commission
the
women
of
the
united
states
can
but
hold
grover
cleveland
equally
guilty
with
the
xlix
congress
in
punishing
women
for
the
crimes
of
men
the
code
of
england
from
which
that
of
the
united
states
is
largely
borrowed
was
the
outgrowth
of
christianity
based
upon
a
belief
in
man
s
superiority
and
woman
s
subordination
to
him
as
entering
every
relation
of
life
all
legislation
was
class
the
line
was
sex
during
the
early
and
middle
ages
man
exhibited
an
antagonism
towards
woman
which
if
not
wholly
created
by
religious
belief
was
strenuously
fostered
by
the
church
man
s
basest
passion
love
of
power
was
appealed
to
and
he
was
assured
by
what
he
had
been
trained
to
regard
as
indisputable
authority
that
god
had
ordained
his
rule
over
woman
a
quick
response
met
all
such
priestly
teaching
christianity
has
ever
been
a
religion
of
the
emotions
rather
than
of
the
reason
the
former
was
cultivated
the
latter
bitterly
condemned
the
church
has
ever
found
its
most
powerful
enemy
in
reason
hence
the
exercise
of
reason
has
ever
been
a
crime
in
her
eyes
during
the
christian
ages
the
different
code
of
morals
for
man
and
woman
has
created
infinite
wrong
open
and
notorious
vice
among
both
churchmen
and
laymen
passed
unreproved
but
an
heiress
forfeited
her
possessions
by
unchastity
and
wily
plans
were
laid
to
thus
gain
possession
of
her
property
the
betrayer
receiving
payment
from
the
guardian
whose
tool
he
was
for
his
perfidy
to
this
moral
code
we
trace
the
present
legal
condition
of
girls
daughters
having
no
status
in
the
courts
in
case
of
betrayal
the
father
alone
as
master
and
owner
can
sue
for
loss
of
her
services
while
the
injury
to
herself
is
passed
by
even
upon
so
momentous
a
question
as
the
paternity
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
many
of
the
most
flagrant
wrongs
perpetrated
against
woman
can
be
traced
to
a
denial
of
a
right
of
ownership
beginning
with
the
denial
of
her
right
to
herself
even
the
salic
law
which
in
france
was
used
to
bar
the
succession
of
woman
to
the
throne
was
not
specifically
or
primarily
in
favor
of
males
it
was
a
property
law
growing
out
of
the
patriarchal
idea
of
property
in
woman
under
christian
form
of
marriage
woman
was
transferred
to
another
family
whose
name
she
took
she
not
only
became
the
property
of
her
husband
but
all
real
or
personal
estate
which
she
possessed
also
became
his
thus
her
property
went
to
the
enrichment
of
another
family
her
home
was
no
longer
with
her
own
people
but
where
her
husband
chose
to
make
it
salic
law
derived
its
name
from
sala
a
house
salic
land
said
montesquieu
was
the
land
belonging
to
the
house
at
time
of
its
adoption
the
line
of
descent
was
male
under
it
during
the
middle
ages
when
a
daughter
married
she
received
merely
a
chaplet
of
roses
thenceforth
her
interests
were
elsewhere
and
her
children
became
part
of
another
family
she
was
entirely
lost
to
the
family
of
her
birth
as
she
was
no
longer
a
part
of
it
she
did
not
receive
inheritance
it
was
not
a
subject
of
affection
but
guizot
with
a
fine
sense
of
irony
termed
salic
law
essentially
a
penal
code
its
application
to
woman
was
incontestibly
penal
in
france
its
action
has
been
most
pronounced
robertson
speaks
of
the
salic
law
as
the
most
venerable
monument
of
french
jurisprudence
although
the
real
period
of
its
birth
has
never
yet
been
fully
acknowledged
while
during
the
struggle
of
phillippa
de
valours
and
edward
iii
for
the
crown
of
france
this
law
was
invoked
to
prevent
the
succession
of
phillippa
yet
we
know
that
in
gaul
during
the
time
of
caesar
mothers
had
sole
authority
over
their
children
even
boys
remaining
in
entire
charge
of
the
mother
until
old
enough
for
instruction
in
arms
wives
also
possessed
property
rights
upon
marriage
the
husband
adding
the
same
amount
of
property
he
had
received
with
his
wife
this
was
kept
as
a
separate
fund
the
survivor
taking
the
whole
hallum
designated
the
contest
between
phillippa
and
edward
as
in
every
way
remarkable
but
especially
on
account
of
its
result
in
the
exclusion
of
woman
from
the
succession
then
first
suggested
it
was
the
latin
races
rather
than
the
scandinavian
or
teutonic
that
first
essentially
degraded
woman
the
riparian
franks
as
lovers
of
liberty
were
the
first
who
broke
away
from
the
rule
of
this
law
both
the
scandinavians
and
teutons
possessed
prophetic
women
or
priestesses
to
whom
the
highest
deference
was
shown
the
teutonic
races
were
early
noted
for
the
high
respect
in
which
they
held
women
a
respect
closely
bordering
upon
veneration
the
greatest
deference
was
shown
to
their
opinions
even
upon
war
the
chief
business
of
men
s
lives
victoria
received
the
title
of
mother
of
camps
and
was
an
especially
venerated
person
veleda
by
superior
genius
directed
the
counsels
of
the
nation
and
for
nine
years
prevented
the
progress
of
the
imperial
armies
of
rome
the
most
momentous
questions
of
state
and
of
religion
were
submitted
to
woman
s
divine
judgment
the
relation
between
the
wrongs
of
woman
and
her
of
property
and
of
herself
are
very
complicated
the
custom
of
marquette
originated
from
the
theory
of
property
in
woman
the
suzerain
or
lord
possessing
not
only
a
certain
property
right
in
his
male
vassals
but
a
double
right
to
the
woman
who
as
a
bride
became
the
property
of
his
vassal
thus
marquette
was
the
outgrowth
of
the
husband
s
property
right
in
his
wife
and
a
secondary
result
of
man
s
assumed
right
of
property
in
woman
in
france
where
the
salic
law
possessed
greatest
strength
we
find
the
custom
of
marquette
most
prevalent
next
to
marquette
the
law
known
as
mund
or
mundium
offered
the
greatest
indignity
to
woman
and
in
some
respects
may
be
called
more
vile
while
the
baseness
of
marquette
took
its
victims
from
a
class
beneath
the
lord
in
social
standing
mundium
entered
the
family
the
father
selling
his
daughter
to
such
wooer
as
he
chose
or
from
whom
he
received
the
greatest
payment
entirely
regardless
of
the
wishes
of
the
daughter
herself
the
salic
law
seemed
to
have
been
founded
on
the
principle
of
the
mund
as
under
it
a
sum
was
paid
by
the
husband
to
the
family
of
the
bride
in
consideration
of
the
transference
of
the
authority
they
possessed
over
her
to
the
husband
and
this
payment
was
known
as
mundium
and
the
bride
as
a
mund
bought
woman
in
denmark
to
which
country
the
custom
of
mundium
extended
her
appellation
was
signifying
a
mund
bought
woman
at
that
period
descent
was
reckoned
from
the
father
to
whom
alone
the
children
were
held
to
be
related
and
his
relinquishment
of
authority
by
sale
of
his
daughter
transferred
her
relationship
from
her
father
to
her
husband
and
she
thus
became
a
component
part
of
another
family
she
no
longer
belonged
to
the
family
of
her
birth
but
to
that
of
her
purchaser
the
franks
were
the
first
to
break
salic
customs
and
to
permit
a
father
to
settle
an
estate
upon
his
daughter
and
her
children
under
the
law
of
gavelkind
as
it
existed
in
great
britain
daughters
never
inherited
although
the
rights
of
even
an
illegitimate
son
was
recognized
as
equal
to
those
of
legitimate
sons
by
the
laws
of
gavelkind
property
could
not
descend
to
women
but
the
county
of
kent
possessed
more
freedom
than
in
any
other
part
of
england
there
was
a
custom
of
privilege
annexed
to
all
lands
of
this
kind
in
kent
among
them
that
the
wife
should
be
endowed
with
a
moiety
gavelkind
land
was
devisable
by
will
ordinarily
in
gavelkind
property
was
kept
in
male
hands
descending
from
father
to
son
the
very
name
gavelkind
is
said
to
bear
this
signification
the
word
is
dutch
signifying
a
male
child
thus
eal
means
give
all
to
the
son
its
modern
signification
is
the
custom
of
partition
of
property
among
males
alone
or
the
greatest
share
to
the
oldest
son
lord
coke
looked
upon
the
practice
of
gavelkind
among
the
irish
as
a
mark
of
their
descent
from
the
ancient
britons
at
this
period
wives
were
not
entitled
to
dower
thus
in
respect
to
property
all
women
of
the
family
were
equally
disinherited
but
it
was
the
opinion
of
lord
holt
that
by
the
common
law
both
before
and
after
the
conquest
all
the
children
both
male
and
female
inherited
both
the
real
and
the
personal
estate
and
in
like
proportion
but
in
the
reign
of
henry
i
daughters
in
case
there
were
sons
began
to
be
excluded
from
the
real
estate
these
laws
so
essentially
salic
it
can
readily
be
seen
originated
in
the
mundium
passing
as
a
mund
woman
into
another
family
the
succession
of
property
to
her
under
this
slave
condition
was
contrary
to
sound
domestic
policy
to
bestow
property
upon
a
daughter
was
to
enrich
another
family
at
the
expense
of
the
one
from
whom
the
was
purchased
and
her
disinheritance
was
but
a
logical
result
of
her
legal
condition
if
we
admit
the
premises
we
must
admit
the
wisdom
of
her
exclusion
from
succession
it
is
curious
to
note
the
difference
in
woman
s
position
which
possession
of
property
has
ever
made
this
difference
especially
noticeable
during
feudalism
in
case
of
an
heiress
with
fiefs
is
no
less
so
at
the
present
day
it
is
a
mark
of
an
unripe
civilization
that
the
rights
of
property
have
ever
been
regarded
before
those
of
person
walker
over
sixty
years
since
recognized
the
power
of
property
in
ameliorating
woman
s
condition
then
declaring
that
the
first
step
toward
an
acknowledgment
of
her
equality
must
be
a
recognition
of
her
rights
of
property
his
broad
knowledge
of
ancient
law
having
taught
him
the
close
connection
of
property
rights
and
personal
rights
during
many
ages
battle
was
done
for
possessions
and
the
protection
of
what
a
man
owned
even
the
war
of
the
american
revolution
was
begun
for
property
rights
rather
than
for
those
of
person
the
stamp
act
and
the
tax
on
tea
roused
the
colonies
to
resistance
a
woman
first
spoke
the
words
inherent
rights
and
by
the
time
nationality
was
proclaimed
the
colonists
had
learned
far
enough
to
say
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
consent
is
an
important
consideration
in
all
questions
affecting
humanity
and
is
one
in
which
woman
is
most
deeply
concerned
at
close
of
the
civil
war
frederick
douglass
advised
colored
men
to
get
property
he
had
not
failed
to
learn
the
connection
between
property
and
personal
rights
since
mississippi
in
pennsylvania
and
new
york
in
and
rhode
island
about
the
same
period
secured
property
rights
to
married
women
there
has
been
a
great
and
rapidly
increasing
change
in
woman
s
position
and
as
she
constantly
enters
new
industries
earning
and
controlling
money
we
find
her
as
constantly
more
free
and
respected
when
the
english
married
women
s
property
bill
based
upon
that
of
new
york
became
a
law
a
few
years
since
the
with
the
perspicuity
of
our
great
thinker
walker
said
it
probably
portends
indirect
social
effects
much
greater
than
the
disposition
of
property
and
it
may
in
the
end
pulverize
some
ideas
which
have
been
at
the
basis
of
english
life
measures
which
affect
the
family
economy
are
apt
to
be
epoch
making
and
probably
when
the
most
talked
of
bills
of
the
session
are
clean
forgotten
this
obscure
measure
may
be
bearing
fruit
the
exception
of
married
women
in
the
demand
for
political
rights
by
the
women
of
england
owes
its
origin
to
the
old
monkish
theory
that
marriage
is
debasement
and
celibate
life
in
either
man
or
woman
a
much
higher
condition
after
the
passage
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
during
the
civil
war
john
stuart
mill
declared
that
married
women
were
the
only
class
of
slaves
remaining
on
earth
as
long
as
a
condition
of
religious
or
political
subjection
continues
for
her
a
belief
in
the
sanctity
of
womanhood
can
not
exist
and
crimes
against
her
will
be
lightly
punished
the
most
debased
men
of
england
and
the
united
states
if
arrested
for
cruelty
to
wives
agree
in
the
indignant
questioning
protest
is
she
not
my
own
that
i
should
punish
her
as
i
please
such
has
been
the
power
of
the
priesthood
over
the
consciences
and
lives
of
men
that
we
find
whatever
is
bad
in
the
laws
either
directly
or
indirectly
traceable
to
their
influence
our
anglo
saxon
forefathers
were
early
amenable
to
religious
authority
and
for
a
period
of
many
hundred
years
clerical
influence
was
exceedingly
powerful
over
them
the
church
is
responsible
for
the
severity
with
which
the
simplest
infraction
of
law
was
visited
upon
the
most
humble
and
helpless
classes
and
the
greater
penalty
awarded
to
those
least
capable
of
resistance
it
was
for
the
free
man
of
low
estate
for
the
slave
and
for
woman
that
the
greatest
atrocities
were
reserved
if
a
free
woman
stole
she
was
to
be
thrown
down
a
precipice
or
drowned
which
pike
regards
as
the
origin
of
dragging
witches
through
a
pond
if
the
thief
was
a
slave
and
stole
from
any
but
her
own
master
she
was
condemned
to
be
burnt
alive
and
her
fellow
slaves
were
compelled
to
assist
at
the
incineration
none
dared
to
speak
a
good
word
for
women
in
opposition
to
church
teachings
all
her
instincts
were
held
as
evil
as
the
law
and
the
father
robbed
the
daughter
so
the
law
and
the
church
alike
robbed
the
family
by
ancient
english
law
as
before
noted
every
person
who
made
a
will
was
bound
to
remember
his
lord
with
the
best
thing
he
possessed
and
afterwards
the
church
with
the
next
best
thing
but
as
the
church
gained
power
it
took
supreme
place
in
the
testament
the
peasant
was
looked
upon
as
but
slightly
above
the
cattle
he
cared
for
a
certain
degree
of
sameness
in
material
and
intellectual
conditions
everywhere
existed
the
masses
over
christendom
were
alike
under
bondage
of
the
thought
and
modes
of
action
social
life
showed
no
marked
change
for
many
hundred
years
freedom
was
an
unknown
word
or
if
by
chance
spoken
found
itself
under
the
ban
of
the
church
and
the
state
justice
was
unthought
of
the
only
question
being
has
the
church
ordered
it
a
complete
system
of
espionage
existed
under
both
church
and
state
as
late
as
the
time
of
alfred
in
england
every
nine
men
were
under
charge
of
a
tenth
no
man
could
work
outside
of
his
father
s
employment
to
which
he
was
bound
at
nine
o
clock
curfew
bell
all
fires
and
lights
were
extinguished
a
mechanic
could
not
find
work
outside
of
his
own
village
monasteries
and
castles
contained
all
there
was
of
power
and
comfort
as
late
as
the
reformation
we
find
the
condition
of
english
society
lax
and
immoral
henry
the
viii
was
a
fair
type
of
the
nation
the
court
the
camp
the
church
were
all
in
line
moulding
the
sentiment
of
community
although
henry
had
declared
the
church
to
be
an
entire
and
perfect
body
within
itself
possessing
authority
to
regulate
and
decide
all
things
without
dependence
upon
any
foreign
the
pope
did
not
fail
to
generally
define
the
supremacy
of
the
church
as
united
with
and
dependent
upon
the
temporal
government
of
the
realm
the
king
instead
of
the
pope
becoming
its
spiritual
head
many
new
and
restrictive
canons
were
promulgated
under
henry
the
prohibitory
laws
regarding
nearness
of
relationship
in
marriage
exceeded
those
of
the
catholic
church
it
is
but
a
few
decades
since
these
prohibitions
commencing
with
a
man
shall
not
marry
his
grandmother
a
woman
shall
not
marry
her
grandfather
and
extending
down
to
remote
cousinship
to
be
found
printed
upon
the
fly
leaves
of
every
new
testament
for
a
long
period
after
the
reformation
english
women
were
not
permitted
to
read
the
bible
a
statute
of
the
eighth
henry
prohibiting
women
and
others
of
low
degree
from
its
use
apparently
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
conversation
among
women
regarding
the
tyranny
under
which
they
were
kept
a
law
was
passed
forbidding
the
residence
of
more
than
one
woman
in
a
cottage
and
this
after
the
protestant
religion
had
been
confirmed
as
that
of
the
realm
as
late
as
elizabeth
it
was
held
a
heinous
offence
for
a
cottager
to
give
a
home
to
his
own
widowed
mother
or
homeless
sister
the
especial
criminality
of
thus
harboring
one
s
female
relatives
lay
in
the
fact
of
their
being
as
late
as
the
xvi
century
the
law
still
entered
houses
and
magistrates
bound
out
to
servile
labor
all
women
between
eleven
and
forty
years
of
age
the
degradation
of
women
under
the
reformation
was
still
more
gross
than
under
catholicism
the
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
canonization
of
many
women
as
saints
in
the
romish
calendar
threw
a
certain
halo
about
womankind
that
is
impossible
to
discover
in
the
protestant
church
or
since
the
reformation
the
church
of
whatever
name
taught
woman
s
innate
depravity
was
so
great
that
forcible
restraint
alone
prevented
her
from
plunging
into
vice
while
christian
women
outside
the
levant
were
not
confined
in
a
harem
under
watch
and
ward
yet
various
methods
of
restraint
have
been
used
in
christian
lands
within
the
past
few
centuries
among
the
most
noted
of
these
the
chastity
belt
three
are
yet
known
to
be
in
existence
one
is
preserved
in
the
museum
at
cluny
france
another
is
in
keeping
of
the
castle
of
rosenburg
copenhagen
the
third
was
exhibited
in
the
united
states
by
heidmann
s
traveling
museum
according
to
tradition
the
one
persevered
at
cluny
was
in
use
during
the
xvi
century
in
reign
of
francis
i
who
ascended
the
throne
january
the
remaining
two
in
denmark
under
christian
iv
in
the
seventeenth
century
at
this
period
denmark
was
greatly
agitated
by
a
religious
war
which
however
did
not
include
woman
s
freedom
in
its
demands
these
belts
are
hideous
proofs
of
the
low
estimate
in
which
woman
s
moral
character
was
held
and
equally
striking
evidence
of
man
s
freedom
and
immorality
the
disrespect
shown
by
the
clergy
towards
marriage
as
compared
with
the
celibate
condition
has
influenced
thought
in
many
singular
directions
england
s
married
women
under
the
combined
influence
of
church
and
state
deprecate
the
claim
of
suffrage
for
themselves
although
asking
it
for
single
women
and
widows
the
bill
referred
to
in
the
memorial
extended
parliamentary
franchise
to
single
women
alone
second

shall

or

at
such

the
word
coverture
expresses
a
married
woman
s
subordinate
condition
both
civilly
and
religiously
it
means
under
the
power
of
the
husband
controlled
by
the

nor
individual
rights
a
being
not

s
consent
the
law

incompetent
a

under
coverture
is
an
irresponsible
being
except
in
case
of
crime
when
married
women
refuse
to
seek
the
same
freedom
for
themselves
they
ask
for
single
women
they
practically
endorse
the
judgment
of
church
and
state
in
favor
of
celibacy
when
married
women
thus
ignore
their
equality
with
single
women
they
practically
condemn
that
relation
practically
affirm
the
superior
purity
of
a
celibate
condition
the
low
estimate
of
women
in
england
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
is
shown
in
its
literature
especially
that
emanating
from
its
great
universities
the
betrayal
of
women
formed
the
basis
of
story
and
song
not
content
with
portraying
their
own
vices
these
men
did
not
hesitate
to
put
a
plea
against
chastity
in
the
mouths
of
mere
children
of
such
character
is
a
ballad
emanating
from
this
source
but
professing
to
have
been
composed
by
miss
nelly
pentwenzle
a
young
lady
of
to
be
sung
to
the
tune
of
scraps
of
a
periodical
entitled
old
woman
s
printed
in
london
without
date
but
from
internal
evidence
shown
to
belong
to
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
forcibly
protests
against
the
destruction
of
innocence
which
was
the
chief
amusement
of
the
men
of
this
period
it
asks
why
should
it
be
less
a
crime
to
deceive
an
inexperienced
girl
whose
youth
renders
it
impossible
that
she
should
know
the
world
than
it
would
be
to
lead
a
blind
man
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
thus
the
laws
and
customs
of
family
and
social
life
the
literature
of
different
periods
the
habits
of
thought
the
entire
civilization
of
christian
centuries
has
tended
to
the
debasement
of
woman
and
the
consequent
destruction
of
moral
life
the
world
stands
where
it
does
today
upon
all
these
great
questions
biased
by
a
through
the
ages
of
the
sanctity
of
womanhood
and
a
disbelief
in
her
rights
of
person
within
the
marriage
relation
or
without
taught
as
this
lesson
has
been
by
the
church
and
emphasized
by
the
laws
of
the
state
there
have
ever
been
many
severities
connected
with
dower
in
england
by
old
law
if
a
widow
married
within
a
year
from
the
death
of
her
husband
she
forfeited
her
dower
this
law
accounts
for
the
superstitious
sentiment
as
to
following
the
woman
who
within
a
year
and
a
day
like
the
freedom
of
the
roman
usus
kept
up
by
a
three
days
absence
in
each
year
this
extra
day
of
the
widow
s
mourning
seems
to
have
been
added
as
security
for
the
dower
while
under
the
most
ancient
law
of
christian
europe
the
widow
lost
her
dower
if
she
married
again
the
turks
recognizing
the
greater
freedom
of
a
widow
pay
her
who
a
sum
for
parting
with
her
liberty
the
general
rule
of
dower
held
that
when
arranged
at
time
of
marriage
although
the
husband
then
possessed
but
a
small
portion
of
freehold
and
afterwards
made
great
acquisitions
if
no
mention
of
new
purchases
was
made
at
time
of
such
arrangement
the
widow
could
not
claim
more
than
the
third
part
of
the
land
possessed
by
the
husband
at
time
of
marriage
in
like
manner
if
a
husband
had
no
land
and
endowed
his
wife
with
chattels
money
or
other
things
afterwards
making
great
acquisitions
in
land
she
could
not
claim
dower
in
such
acquisition
neither
could
a
woman
dispose
of
her
dower
during
her
husband
s
life
this
was
quite
unlike
the
freedom
enjoyed
by
a
wife
in
ancient
wales
where
the
dower
became
absolutely
her
own
to
dispose
of
as
she
pleased
under
english
law
the
husband
during
the
lifetime
of
his
wife
could
give
or
sell
or
alien
her
dower
in
any
way
that
it
pleased
him
to
do
and
the
wife
in
this
as
in
all
other
things
was
obliged
to
conform
to
the
husband
s
will
the
wife
s
dower
right
in
personal
property
can
be
aliened
by
the
husband
in
the
united
states
during
the
wife
s
lifetime
he
may
give
sell
or
in
any
way
dispose
of
the
whole
of
his
personal
property
absolutely
and
the
wife
has
no
redress
she
is
not
held
as
having
any
right
title
or
interest
in
it
as
long
as
her
husband
lives
the
husband
can
also
alien
his
real
estate
subject
only
to
his
wife
s
dower
right
in
case
she
survive
him
should
she
decease
before
him
she
has
no
power
over
it
the
law
in
england
as
laid
down
by
glanville
was
that
in
case
the
wife
withheld
her
consent
to
the
sale
of
property
she
might
claim
her
dower
after
her
husband
s
death
but
this
could
only
have
had
reference
to
real
property
and
is
the
same
in
the
united
states
if
the
wife
withholds
her
consent
to
the
sale
of
real
estate
it
still
can
be
sold
away
from
her
and
she
thus
be
deprived
of
a
home
it
is
merely
subject
to
her
dower
right
in
the
value
of
the
property
at
time
of
sale
and
in
case
she
survives
her
husband
should
she
die
first
she
has
no
redress
sales
of
this
character
are
constantly
made
at
a
small
discount
upon
chance
of
the
wife
s
nonsurvival
as
dower
right
in
real
estate
does
not
invest
the
wife
with
its
ownership
in
fee
but
merely
the
use
of
during
her
natural
life
it
will
readily
be
seen
how
very
small
is
the
wife
s
protection
in
even
in
this
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
bracton
gives
two
reasons
why
the
english
husband
could
sell
the
dower
assigned
to
the
wife
without
her
consent
first
because
a
wife
has
no
freehold
in
a
dower
previous
to
its
being
assigned
to
her
second
because
she
can
not
gainsay
her
husband
as
late
as
the
last
quarter
of
the
present
century
the
learned
professor
of
jurisprudence
of
cambridge
university
attempted
to
prove
that
it
was
no
reproach
against
woman
s
intellect
that
she
was
prohibited
from
making
a
contract
during
marriage
although
failing
in
this
attempt
he
clearly
succeeded
in
proving
woman
s
condition
of
pecuniary
and
personal
slavery
in
the
marriage
relation
he
said
it
is
not
an
imputation
on
the
wife
s
experience
or
strength
of
mind
but
is
solely
grounded
on
her
not
being
assumed
by
common
law
to
have
sufficient
command
of
her
purse
or
of
her
future
actions
wherewith
to
procure
materials
for
making
a
contract
the
legal
presumption
then
is
that
she
did
not
intend
to
make
one
and
therefore
the
allegation
that
she
did
make
a
contract
would
imply
on
the
face
of
it
a
fraud
the
legal
presumption
that
the
wife
has
neither
sufficient
command
of
her
purse
or
of
her
future
actions
to
guarantee
an
intent
of
making
a
contract
needs
no
further
assertion
to
prove
her
enslavement
the
person
neither
possessing
control
of
property
or
of
their
own
actions
is
a
slave
regardless
of
or
under
what
verbiage
of
law
or
custom
that
condition
is
represented
attempts
are
constantly
made
both
in
the
united
states
and
england
to
take
from
woman
the
dower
right
now
accruing
to
them
during
an
act
was
passed
taking
from
english
wives
all
dower
right
giving
the
husband
power
to
bar
the
wife
in
all
cases
and
scarcely
a
legislature
convenes
in
the
united
states
that
has
not
a
similar
bill
introduced
before
it
as
dower
rights
increase
the
complication
of
land
transfer
just
as
soon
as
the
law
which
gave
the
husband
the
power
to
bar
this
right
became
operative
in
england
conveyancers
began
to
insert
a
debaring
clause
in
every
deed
of
conveyance
thus
systematically
despoiling
the
wife
even
when
the
husband
might
not
otherwise
have
been
so
disposed
as
masterless
women
widows
in
england
have
received
similar
contemptuous
treatment
as
accorded
single
women
to
whom
that
country
long
showed
such
barbarity
it
is
curiously
noted
by
alexander
that
moses
placed
widows
in
the
same
rank
as
harlots
and
profane
women
the
law
of
tenancy
by
courtesy
which
gives
a
husband
rights
in
the
separate
property
of
a
wife
is
very
unjust
when
compared
with
the
dower
rights
of
a
wife
in
such
case
provided
she
has
borne
a
living
child
even
should
such
child
breathe
but
once
the
husband
in
case
of
the
death
of
his
wife
holds
the
entire
real
estate
during
his
life
as
tenant
by
he
also
takes
the
whole
of
her
personal
property
absolutely
to
dispose
of
as
he
chooses
in
a
few
of
the
united
states
the
wife
can
defeat
this
by
will
but
in
the
large
majority
of
christian
lands
the
full
rights
of
tenancy
by
the
courtesy
still
prevail
where
right
of
dower
still
prevails
the
wife
if
there
are
children
takes
but
of
the
personal
property
absolutely
if
there
are
no
children
the
rest
passing
to
collateral
heirs
who
may
be
the
husband
s
most
distant
relatives
in
case
no
such
relative
can
be
found
the
balance
escheats
to
the
state
although
in
the
state
of
new
york
the
widow
under
such
circumstances
receives
over
one
half
of
the
real
property
she
has
the
use
of
but
in
contradistinction
to
the
use
of
the
whole
of
her
real
property
which
goes
to
the
husband
by
tenancy
of
in

the

are
robbed
of

the

of
a
spanish
widow
for
dower
right
in
an
estate
of
several
millions
left
by
her
deceased
husband
was
fully
reported
by
the
new
york
daily
papers
within
the
past
five
years
suddenly
reduced
from
affluence
as
the
wife
of
this
man
to
the
most
abject
poverty
as
his
widow
this
wife
and

brought
suit
against
the
estate
and
her
children
who
receiving
all
the
property
by
the
husband
s
will
left
her
absolutely
beggared
in
ancient
ireland
the
condition
of
woman
was
far
superior
to
that
of
the
christian
women
of
england
or
scotland
two
forms
of
marriage
existed
under
that
of
equal
dignity
the
rights
of
the
contracting
parties
were
the
same
and
took
place
when
the
man
and
woman
possessed
the
same
amount
of
land
cattle
or
household
goods
no
force
or
sale
accompanied
it
the
woman
giving
free
consent
equally
with
the
man
this
marriage
was
looked
upon
as
a
contract
between
equals
the
property
of
the
wife
did
not
revert
to
the
husband
she
retained
its
control
loaning
it
and
receiving
interest
entirely
free
from
the
interference
of
her
husband
ancient
irish
law
also
secured
to
the
mother
equal
authority
with
the
father
over
the
children
of
the
marriage
there
is
no
trace
of
that
arbitrary
control
over
both
wife
and
children
with
which
christianity
endowed
the
father
the
daughter
was
held
to
be
more
closely
related
to
the
father
a
son
to
the
mother
this
belief
contributing
an
equality
of
right
between
the
sexes
these
laws
were
authoritative
over
the
whole
of
ireland
until
the
invasion
of
the
danes
in
the
eight
century
it
is
remarkable
what
effect
the
ownership
of
property
by
woman
has
ever
had
in
ameliorating
her
legal
condition
even
in
ancient
ireland
the
wife
without
possessions
became
the
slave
of
her
husband
although
the
son
was
held
as
more
nearly
related
to
his
mother
this
ancient
code
provided
that
in
case
his
parents
were
poor
and
he
had
not
wealth
enough
to
support
both
father
and
mother
he
was
to
leave
the
latter
to
die
in
the
ditch
but
was
to
carry
his
father
back
to
his
own
home
tradition
ascribes
this
code
to
patrick
in
the
fifth
century
under
modern
christian
law
the
legal
obligation
of
a
son
to
support
his
father
is
greater
than
it
is
to
support
his
mother
quite
in
opposition
to
the
old
scandinavian
pagan
law
which
provided
for
the
support
of
the
mother
if
but
one
parent
could
be
cared
for
not
the
least
among
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
ireland
by
english
usurpation
has
been
the
destruction
of
the
wife
s
rights
of
property
the
right
of
the
irish
wife
to
deal
with
her
own
property
as
she
chose
irrespective
of
her
husband
s
consent
was
expressly
declared
illegal
by
english
judges
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
there
are
traces
of
separate
property
rights
for
woman
early
among
aryan
peoples
by
the
old
laws
of
wales
a
wife
became
legal
owner
of
part
of
her
husband
s
effects
immediately
upon
marrying
him
and
had
the
sole
disposal
of
this
portion
even
during
her
husband
s
life
debt
owed
by
a
husband
to
a
wife
was
as
binding
on
him
and
his
heirs
and
executors
as
a
debt
to
any
other
person
after
the
english
laws
were
introduced
into
wales
innumerable
disputes
arose
upon
this
ground
the
welsh
woman
being
persistent
in
her
determination
to
cling
to
her
old
rights
and
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
her
will
upon
this
subject
was
stronger
than
the
will
of
english
legislators
as
proven
by
legal
records
in
other
respects
the
ancient
law
of
wales
favored
woman
a
husband
s
fetid
breath
was
held
as
good
cause
for
divorce
on
part
of
the
wife
who
in
such
case
took
with
her
the
whole
of
her
property
while
still
living
with
her
husband
the
welsh
wife
possessed
the
right
to
three
kinds
of
property
cowyll
gowyn
and
sarand
known
as
her
three
peculiars
old
welsh
law
was
unique
in
that
it
forbade
both
satisfaction
and
vengeance
for
the
same
wrong
even
if
detecting
his
wife
in
adultery
for
which
he
should
chastise
her
the
husband
was
forbidden
any
satisfaction
besides
that
in
case
of
an
illegitimate
birth
the
law
provided
that
the
man
should
wholly
maintain
the
child
a
species
of
justice
not
found
under
christianity
the
laws
of
howell
the
good
enacted
at
a
later
date
under
the
supervision
of
the
church
favored
the
man
at
the
woman
s
expense
under
these
laws
if
a
husband
and
wife
separated
the
father
took
of
the
children
the
oldest
and
the
youngest
falling
to
his
share
while
the
middle
one
fell
to
the
mother
a
woman
was
not
admitted
as
surety
or
as
a
witness
in
matters
concerning
a
man
in
the
division
of
property
the
daughters
received
only
one
half
the
amount
given
to
the
sons
under
the
christian
laws
of
england
by
which
the
property
of
a
married
woman
passed
entirely
into
the
control
of
her
husband
the
abduction
of
heiresses
in
that
country
was
very
common
for
many
hundred
years
no
punishment
following
such
a
theft
although
the
most
compulsory
measures
were
used
even
to
forcibly
bending
the
bride
s
head
in
affirmative
response
during
the
marriage
ceremony
she
was
a
woman
the
law
furnished
her
no
redress
it
regarded
her
as
the
legal
wife
of
her
abductor
to
whom
she
thereafter
under
this
christian
law
owed
service
and
obedience
the
sole
right
to
her
person
her
property
her
children
then
becoming
legally
invested
in
the
robber
husband
as
noted
in
the
opening
chapter
the
abduction
of
a
woman
or
even
an
immodest
proposal
to
her
was
punished
in
older
scandinavia
by
greater
or
lesser
outlawry
rape
being
a
capital
crime
placing
the
culprit
s
life
in
the
hands
of
any
man
he
was
outside
the
pale
of
law
france
under
frequent
changing
names
and
forms
of
government
and
with
a
broader
general
recognition
each
year
of
human
rights
is
yet
very
closely
allied
to
the
barbarism
of
the
middle
ages
in
its
treatment
of
woman
and
its
conception
of
her
natural
rights
this
was
shown
even
during
the
revolution
of
of
which
madame
roland
and
charlotte
corday
were
such
central
heroic
figures
although
this
revolution
established
an
equal
succession
between
sons
and
daughters
yet
it
did
not
tolerate
the
proposition
of
sieyes
and
condorcet
that
woman
should
be
endowed
with
the
suffrage
one
hundred
years
later
in
a
bill
was
introduced
during
the
legislative
session
to
secure
to
woman
the
same
political
rights
accorded
man
this
bill
was
lost
le
gaulois
commenting
upon
it
declared
that
in
whatever
manner
the
question
was
discussed
it
appeared
grotesque
and
ridiculous
in
the
legislative
assembly
of
chapot
proposed
the
prohibition
of
the
right
of
petition
to
women
upon
all
subjects
of
a
political
nature
during
the
same
session
athenase
coquerel
the
most
distinguished
member
of
a
protestant
family
of
clergymen
presented
a
bill
to
the
chambers
excluding
women
from
political
clubs
woman
s
testimony
is
not
accepted
in
regard
to
civil
acts
they
can
not
attest
to
a
birth
or
a
death
nor
is
their
testimony
admitted
in
the
identification
of
persons
neither
can
they
become
members
of
the
family
council
nor
are
they
accepted
as
guardians
of
their
own
children
it
is
only
since
that
their
condition
has
been
in
any
way
ameliorated
the
of
widows
is
forbidden
under
ten
months
after
the
husband
s
death
and
until
within
the
last
decade
divorces
were
of
great
rarity
the
oppressed
condition
of
woman
in
the
marriage
relation
was
notably
shown
by
the
vast
number
of
applications
for
release
from
the
hated
bond
upon
the
passage
of
the
new
law
a
number
so
great
thousand
two
years
scarcely
sufficed
to
reach
them
all
no
stronger
argument
against
the
evils
of
an
indissoluble
marriage
is
required
and
as
the
greater
number
of
applicants
were
women
it
is
farther
evidence
of
woman
s
degradation
under
christian
marriage
laws
according
to
the
famous
code
napoleon
accepted
by
france
as
her
modern
system
of
jurisprudence
and
declared
by
man
to
be
nearly
perfect
in
its
provisions
every
child
born
outside
of
wedlock
is
deemed
to
be
fatherless
unless
such
father
of
his
own
free
will
formally
acknowledges
his
offspring
while
fifty
per
cent
of
all
children
born
in
paris
are
illegitimate
statistics
prove
that
such
acknowledgement
takes
place
but
once
in
fifty
births
thus
per
cent
of
parisian
children
under
the
code
napoleon
theoretically
come
into
the
world
without
are
born
fatherless
a
still
more
heinous
provision
of
this
code
forbids
all
research
into
paternity
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
illegitimate
by
church
held
as
both
morally
and
legally
irresponsible
for
his
fatherhood
under
this
code
upon
the
mother
falls
all
the
contumely
associated
with
such
birth
together
with
the
care
and
expense
of
rearing
the
child
we
can
not
be
surprised
at
the
prevalence
of
infanticide
a
crime
resulting
from
such
unjust
legislation
and
for
which
the
church
is
directly
responsible
in
the
whole
history
of
french
jurisprudence
not
a
single
case
can
be
found
where
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
has
been
compelled
to
acknowledge
his

of
her
own
or
that
of
her

s
family
only
in
case
of
the

of
an
illegitimate

is
she
treated
as
a
responsible
being
and
then
only
that
discomfort
and
punishment
may
fall
upon
her
the
same
legal
degradation
of
the
unmarried
mother
the
same
protection
accorded
the
unmarried
father
the
same
enticement
of
the
law
for
man
to
assume
a
fatherhood
freeing
him
from
accountability
the
same
covert
contempt
of
womanhood
and
of
motherhood
also
exists
in
italy
its
penal
code
forbidding
all
research
into
paternity
and
this
is
not
the
legislation
of
the
middle
ages
but
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
french
disregard
for
the
rights
of
woman
as
already
shown
far
preceded
the
code
napoleon
that
system
but
legally
emphasized
the
low
estimate
of
the
feminine
we
have
traced
through
the
salic
feudal
and
witchcraft
periods
louis
vii
referring
to
the
number
of
girls
born
in
his
dominions
requested
his
subjects
to
pray
unto
god
that
he
should
accord
them
children
of
the
better
sex
upon
the
birth
of
his
first
child
margaret
who
afterwards
married
henry
courtmantel
of
england
his
anger
was
so
great
that
he
would
not
look
at
her
he
even
refused
to
see
his
wife
he
afterwards
accorded
an
annual
pension
of
three
livres
to
the
woman
who
first
announced
to
him
the
birth
of
a
son
although
five
hundred
years
have
passed
since
the
graphic
portrayal
of
woman
s
condition
in
the
ballad
of
the
baron
of
jauioz
we
find
the
breton
farmer
whose
wife
has
given
birth
to
a
daughter
still
saying
my
wife
has
had
a
question
an
ordinary
french
peasant
in
regard
to
his
family
and
the
father
of
girls
alone
he
will
reply
i
have
no
children
sir
i
have
only
during
the
feudal
period
parents
gave
themselves
up
to
and
rejoicing
upon
the
marriage
of
the
last
of
their
daughters
even
yet
in
some
countries
the
birth
of
a
boy
is
announced
by
a
servant
wearing
a
white
apron
and
carrying
two
bouquets
in
her
hand
if
a
girl
she
carries
but
one
in
some
countries
the
father
of
a
boy
annually
received
the
gift
of
two
loads
of
wood
from
the
state
but
a
single
one
if
the
child
was
a
girl
even
in
the
united
states
we
yet
see
this
contempt
of
the
feminine
variously
manifested
although
the
kindness
and
affection
of
girls
to
their
parents
is
usually
more
notable
than
that
of
boys
family
regard
is
usually
manifested
in
the
descending
rather
than
the
ascending
line
yet
herbert
spencer
declares
that
full
civilization
is
dependent
upon
the
respect
and
affection
shown
to
parents
france
is
not
the
only
christian
land
that
invalidates
a
woman
s
testimony
receiving
the
assertion
of
the
woman
with
less
authority
than
the
denial
of
the
man
in
scotland
in
case
of
an
illegitimate
birth
the
accused
man
is
allowed
to
clear
himself
upon
oath
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
woman
under
scottish
law
the
child
born
outside
of
marriage
was
formerly
compelled
to
do
penance
in
church
for
the
sins
of
his
parents
such
has
been
the
justice
of
christianity
to
women
and
children
during
the
ages
these
methods
of
christianity
were
in
great
contrast
to
those
of
heathendom
the
early
pagan
laws
contained
provisions
for
the
punishment
of
assaults
upon
women
crimes
against
her
were
punished
by
greater
or
less
outlawry
according
to
the
attendant
circumstances
old
scandinavia
possessed
many
laws
for
the
protection
of
woman
it
has
sometimes
been
asserted
that
these
laws
were
a
dead
letter
so
many
instances
of
loose
connections
are
recorded
in
the
iceland
sagas
it
is
however
a
question
of
fact
that
these
illegal
relations
according
to
the
same
sagas
were
much
more
frequent
after
the
introduction
of
christianity
than
before
roman
law
presumed
that
no
woman
went
astray
without
the
seduction
and
arts
of
the
other
sex
upon
whom
alone
the
punishment
fell
under
old
saxon
gothic
and
scandinavian
law
rape
was
punished
by
death
under
the
conqueror
its
punishment
was
castration
and
loss
of
the
eyes
which
continued
english
law
until
after
bracton
wrote
in
time
of
henry
iii
a
lighter
punishment
then
superseded
it
but
the
effects
of
this
leniency
was
so
evil
the
old
penalty
was
restored
while
forbidding
woman
control
of
her
own
property
common
law
under
one
of
those
anomalous
renderings
which
mark
the
constant
injustice
of
church
and
state
towards
woman
held
twelve
years
as
the
age
of
female
discretion
or
consent
rape
after
that
age
not
being
regarded
as
criminal
germany
with
sudden
strides
has
coalesced
from
a
number
of
independent
principalities
through
the
management
of
him
of
the
iron
hand
into
a
magnificent
empire
based
upon
the
destruction
of
human
life
in
this
empire
where
war
underlies
all
we
find
woman
much
more
deeply
degraded
than
during
the
old
pagan
days
when
as
chieftain
and
prophetess
her
voice
was
heeded
even
upon
the
battlefield
now
while
men
are
preparing
to
kill
other
men
the
agriculture
of
the
country
and
the
lowest
forms
of
mechanical
labor
fall
into
her
hands
but
it
is
not
as
responsible
owner
we
thus
find
her
she
cultivates
the
fields
as
a
drudge
upon
whom
falls
all
the
most
severe
portion
of
work
equally
in
germany
as
in
other
christian
lands
is
the
wife
looked
upon
as
the
servant
of
the
husband
to
whom
she
bears
children
that
are
his
alone
and
to
whom
greater
deference
is
paid
by
the
mother
when
a
large
number
of
little
ones
call
him
father
it
has
been
the
custom
to
reward
a
husband
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
children
borne
him
by
his
wife
and
it
is
but
a
year
since
a
parisian
journalist
suggested
that
for
each
additional
child
borne
by
his
wife
the
husband
should
be
allowed
half
a
vote
in
germany
as
under
the
common
law
of
england
the
wife
is
subject
to
chastisement
by
her
husband
its
severity
being
left
to
his
discretion
but
the
height
of
barbaric
absurdity
and
wickedness
is
found
in
that
provision
of
the
prussian
common
law
which
decrees
that
a
husband
can
determine
the
length
of
time
his
wife
must
nurse
her
child
as
might
be
expected
at
his
death
the
wife
is
not
regarded
capable
of
caring
for
the
children
and
must
accept
a
guardian
for
them
the
law
going
so
far
as
to
declare
her
under
age
similarly
to
that
french
law
which
makes
woman
a
perpetual
minor
it
matters
not
if
the
family
property
all
came
through
the
wife
or
was
accumulated
by
her
labor
she
is
still
held
as
not
of
sufficient
judgment
for
its
control
in
prussia
woman
is
still
forbidden
to
take
part
in
political
or
other
public
meetings
morganatic
or
marriage
still
continues
the
custom
in
germany
under
its
provisions
the
wife
does
not
take
the
husband
s
rank
nor
do
the
children
inherit
the
father
s
property
as
they
are
not
regarded
as
of
full
legitimacy
this
form
of
marriage
is
recognized
by
the
civil
law
of
germany
and
is
sustained
by
the
church
the
custom
at
first
confined
to
princes
gradually
extended
to
the
higher
aristocracy
and
as
the
moral
perceptions
of
a
nation
bends
itself
to
unison
with
civil
law
the
inferior
gentry
began
to
contract
marriages
of
this
kind
under
a
morganatic
union
woman
is
still
more
debased
than
in
the
ordinary
marriage
relation
aside
from
the
ceremony
the
wife
is
scarcely
other
than
a
concubine
the
children
of
the
morganatic
marriage
do
not
bear
the
father
s
name
nor
inherit
from
him
under
the
law
of
the
state
neither
they
nor
the
wife
have
more
lasting
claim
upon
him
in
these
respects
than
had
the
concubines
known
as
the
honored
ones
upon
the
priestly
destroyers
of
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
several
notable
instances
of
morganatic
marriages
have
occurred
within
the
present
century
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
grand
duke
louis
iv
of
of
queen
victoria
made
a
morganatic
marriage
with
madame
de
kalamine
whose
lover
he
was
long
known
to
have
been
and
with
whom
he
had
previously
lived
outside
of
this
relation
she
having
borne
him
several
children
from
the
high
position
of
the
morganatic
husband
and
because
of
the
previous
relationship
of
the
parties
this
marriage
became
the
talk
of
all
europe
and
to
some
extent
of
the
united
states
queen
victoria
herself
did
not
escape
criticism
notwithstanding
the
prudery
for
which
she
is
famed
because
of
her
entertaining
the
grand
duke
at
windsor
soon
after
this
marriage
unaccompanied
by
his
wife
for
the
purpose
it
was
intimated
of
placing
him
under
the
influence
of
princess
beatrice
the
very
fact
of
such
suggestion
whether
true
or
not
as
well
as
the
fact
that
queen
victoria
universally
conceded
a
prude
in
reference
to
infractions
of
the
moral
law
by
those
of
her
own
sex
received
the
grand
duke
at
her
especial
home
of
windsor
soon
after
his
morganatic
marriage
is
a
vivid
commentary
upon
the
two
codes
of
morals
extant
in
christendom
and
their
influence
even
upon
woman
herself
morganatic
marriage
degrades
the
wife
of
the
right
hand
ceremony
equally
with
her
of
the
left
hand
as
it
is
a
recognition
by
the
law
of
a
christian
country
today
of
man
s
right
to
become
a
bigamist
provided
he
but
gives
his
left
hand
instead
of
his
right
to
the
bride
during
the
marriage
ceremony
it
is
a
system
of
legalized
concubinage
under
protestantism
which
throws
the
shield
of
protection
around
man
in
illicit
relations
and
like
all
other
forms
of
woman
s
degradation
it
reaches
back
for
authority
to
that
religious
teaching
which
proclaims
woman
to
have
been
created
inferior
and
subordinate
to
man
because
of
woman
s
former
superior
position
there
no
country
but
germany
can
as
fully
show
the
degradation
of
woman
under
christianity
not
from
pagan
greece
can
more
vivid
illustration
of
her
moral
degradation
be
shown
while
pagan
rome
shines
clear
and
bright
beside
the
germanic
races
of
today
while
even
marriages
among
the
higher
classes
are
encouraged
and
protected
yet
among
the
lower
orders
in
germany
the
ordinary
marriage
is
cumbered
with
so
many
restrictions
as
to
have
become
almost
an
impossibility
and
no
disgrace
or
loss
of
character
falls
upon
the
girl
of
this
class
who
becomes
a
mother
outside
of
legal
prevision
but
such
motherhood
upon
the
contrary
is
looked
upon
as
the
means
of
a
higher
position
and
greater
wages
as
nurse
as
in
a
rich
or
noble
family
she
becomes
a
person
of
arrogance
part
of
the
pomp
and
show
of
the
house
despite
these
wrongs
of
the
ages
towards
woman
of
late
so
vividly
presented
we
still
find
both
church
and
state
opposing
a
free
discussion
of
the
question
within
the
last
decade
two
northern
european
countries
have
strangely
exhibited
such
hostility
the
opposition
coming
upon
ground
of
woman
s
surpassing
sinfulness
but
the
most
notable
opposition
has
been
against
the
works
of
two
eminent
literary
men
the
doll
s
house
by
ibsen
the
dramatic
poet
of
norway
attacking
the
irresponsible
position
of
the
wife
under
present
marriage
law
brought
about
the
social
ostracism
of
its
author
sweden
s
supremely
great
thinker
of
the
present
century
august
strindberg
recently
published
a
work
entitled
giftas
to
marry
which
incidentally
treated
of
the
influence
of
religion
upon
this
relation
the
state
authorities
at
once
ordered
its
confiscation
instead
of
a
papal
it
fell
under
the
censure
and
prohibition
of
a
protestant
state
but
no
more
ready
method
for
increasing
its
circulation
could
have
been
devised
so
rapidly
was
the
first
edition
of
four
thousand
sold
that
only
four
hundred
fell
into
the
grasp
of
the
censorious
government
in
order
to
escape
the
farther
penalty
of
imprisonment
that
had
been
pronounced
against
him
the
author
was
compelled
to
temporarily
leave
the
country
but
his
work
was
not
without
effect
upon
the
minds
of
his
countrymen
and
upon
his
return
a
few
months
later
a
great
demonstration
in
his
honor
took
place
strindberg
defined
the
rights
of
woman
as
those
which
came
to
her
by
nature
but
of
which
through
a
perverted
social
order
she
had
been
deprived
he
declared
that
woman
s
desire
for
deliverance
was
the
same
as
man
s
restless
desire
for
deliverance
let
us
said
he
therefore
emancipate
man
from
his
prejudice
and
then
woman
will
certainly
be
freed
to
that
end
it
is
necessary
to
work
together
as
friends
not
as
enemies
that
a
work
of
this
moderate
character
should
fall
under
the
ban
of
a
protestant
government
in
the
last
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
should
be
confiscated
and
its
author
banished
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
degraded
condition
of
woman
in
the
marriage
relation
and
of
the
power
still
exerted
for
the
continuance
of
this
subjection
opposition
to
discussion
of
this
question
in
sweden
is
more
strange
in
view
of
the
excess
of
women
in
the
population
as
they
outnumber
the
men
some
while
of
single
women
over
fifteen
there
are
despite
the
fact
of
this
excess
impossible
to
provide
for
by
marriage
even
were
that
condition
one
of
equity
and
equality
all
effort
towards
opening
occupations
to
them
or
the
avenues
of
education
still
meets
with
resistance
from
the
church
the
only
opponent
of
berner
s
bill
for
permitting
women
to
take
the
first
two
degrees
in
the
university
those
of
arts
and
philosophy
was
from
a
clergyman
the
bill
passed
the
odelstling
one
of
the
two
chambers
of
the
storthing
with
only
his
dissentient
voice
it
received
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
other
house

sagthing
april
becoming
a
law
june
of
that
year
russia
which
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
less
than
a
half
civilized
country
gives
evidence
of
an
early
civilization
which
in
the
field
of
morals
reached
a
high
place
samokversof
a
russian
author
has
made
a
rich
collection
relating
to
times
proving
that
as
early
as
the
first
centuries
of
this
era
the
slavonians
lived
in
large
societies
possessed
fortified
towns
with
treasurers
of
gold
and
silver
silk
embroidered
tissues
iron
weapons
ornaments
of
gold
silver
bronze
and
bone
while
sickles
and
the
grasses
of
wheat
oats
and
barley
found
in
the
graves
of
south
russia
show
this
people
even
to
have
been
devoted
to
agriculture
the
early
history
of
russia
proves
that
women
then
held
influential
positions
in
the
family
in
the
church
in
the
state
as
was
the
case
under
the
ancient
common
law
of
england
so
woman
among
the
ancient
slavs
possessed
the
right
of
inheritance
and
the
power
of
dividing
such
inheritance
with
her
brothers
in
the
state
we
find
woman
s
wisdom
at
early
date
still
continuing
to
shape
the
policy
of
the
russian
empire
to
the
wise
statesmanship
of
the
czarina
olga
is
the
unchanging
plan
of
that
country
for
the
ultimate
possession
of
constantinople
due
visiting
the
patriarch
of
the
east
during
the
tenth
century
she
at
once
perceived
the
vast
importance
of
constantinople
to
the
power
desiring
universal
domination
the
possession
of
that
city
giving
control
of
the
dardanelles
of
asia
minor
and
europe
itself
thenceforth
she
sought
its
annexation
or
seizure
and
her
policy
became
that
of
the
russian
nation
which
for
more
than
eight
hundred
years
has
made
the
ultimate
possession
of
constantinople
the
great
object
of
its
ambition
nor
has
olga
s
statesmanship
less
influenced
the
entire
european
continent
the
allied
powers
constantly
struggling
to
defeat
russia
s
aggressive
plan
through
maintenance
of
the
sick
man
upon
his
throne
from
the
advent
of
christianity
forced
upon
the
slav
peoples
a
thousand
years
since
by
vladimir
their
baptism
taking
place
by
tens
of
thousands
as
driven
into
the
rivers
and
streams
priests
upon
the
banks
recited
the
baptism
formula
a
change
was
noticeable
as
soon
as
the
thorough
establishment
of
the
byzantine
church
in
russia
which
took
no
inconsiderable
period
it
being
brought
about
by
force
rather
than
free
will
its
priests
like
those
of
the
western
church
directed
their
principal
efforts
towards
control
of
the
marriage
relation
and
through
that
of
the
family
nor
are
we
to
regard
this
as
strange
inasmuch
as
every
form
of
christianity
regards
woman
as
an
inferior
being
the
creator
of
original
sin
rendering
the
sacrifice
of
a
god
necessary
in
order
to
the
equilibrium
overthrown
by
her
edmond
noble
in
tracing
the
cause
of
the
present
social
upheaval
in
that
empire
says
scarcely
had
the
priests
of
the
greek
church
begun
their
teaching
of
the
new
faith
when
change
began
to
unsettle
the
position
of
woman
and
burden
her
relationship
to
the
family
with
a
sense
of
inferiority
her
status
falling
with
the
natural
extension
of
the
ecclesiastical
policy
the
russian
woman
at
last
became
the
slave
of
her
christian
husband
as
much
his
chattel
as
if
she
had
been
purchased
at
market
or
captured
in
war
an
examination
of
history
proves
that
in
christian
russia
as
in
christian
england
the
husband
could
release
himself
from
the
marriage
bond
by
killing
his
wife
over
whom
under
christian
law
he
had
power
of
life
and
death
her
children
as
today
in
christian
england
and
america
are
not
under
her
control
she
is
to
bear
children
but
not
to
educate
them
for
as
under
catholic
and
protestant
christianity
women
are
looked
upon
as
a
lower
order
of
beings
of
an
unclean
nature
the
assertion
of
agathes
the
sophist
that
he
detected
the
smell
of
her
whose
hands
had
milked
the
cow
is
more
than
paralleled
under
greek
christianity
woman
not
even
being
allowed
to
kill
a
fowl
under
assertion
that
should
she
so
do
the
meat
would
become
poisonous
wife
beating
enjoined
as
a
religious
duty
became
so
common
says
noble
that
love
was
measured
by
it
the
more
whippings
the
more
the
domstroii
a
household
guide
compiled
by
a
dignitary
of
the
greek
church
in
time
of
ivan
the
terrible
counseled
use
of
the
rod
to
keep
wives
children
and
servants
in
subjection
by
it
husbands
were
given
almost
unlimited
power
over
wives
who
were
not
even
permitted
to
attend
church
without
the
husband
s
consent
the
prominent
ideas
regarding
woman
under
byzantine
christianity
have
been
her
uncleanliness
her
sinfulness
and
the
small
value
of
her
life
she
is
regarded
as
a
being
of
lower
order
than
man
and
as
looked
upon
in
a
different
light
by
god
where
marriage
is
wholly
or
partly
under
church
control
its
very
form
degrades
woman
her
promise
of
obedience
not
yet
having
passed
away
in
the
old
covenanter
period
of
scotland
the
records
give
a
still
more
debased
form
in
which
the
man
as
head
was
declared
united
to
an
ignoble
part
represented
by
the
woman
but
in
modern
times
both
in
catholic
and
protestant
countries
a
more
decent
veil
is
thrown
over
this
sacrifice
of
woman
than
in
the
greek
church
where
the
wife
is
sometimes
delivered
to
the
husband
under
this
formula
here
wolf
take
thy
lamb
and
the
bridegroom
is
presented
with
a
whip
by
his
bride
giving
her
a
few
blows
as
part
of
the
ceremony
and
bidding
her
draw
off
his
boots
as
a
sign
of
her
subjection
to
him
with
such
an
entrance
ceremony
it
may
well
be
surmised
that
the
marriage
relation
permits
the
most
revolting
tyranny
and
this
condition
can
be
directly
traced
to
the
period
since
christianity
was
adopted
under
vladimir
a
thousand
years
since
as
the
religion
of
that
nation
the
old
slavs
recognized
the
equality
of
woman
in
household
political
and
religious
matters
and
not
until
byzantine
christianity
became
incorporated
with
and
a
part
of
the
civil
polity
of
its
rulers
did
russia
present
such
a
picture
of
domestic
degradation
as
it
shows
today
the
chastisement
of
wives
is
directly
taught
as
part
of
the
husband
s
domestic
duty
until
recently
the
wife
who
killed
her
husband
while
he
was
thus
punishing
her
was
buried
alive
her
head
only
being
left
above
ground
many
lingered
for
days
before
death
reached
them
ivan
panim
a
russian
exile
while
a
student
at
harvard
college
made
the
following
statement
at
a
convention
of
the
massachusetts
woman
suffrage
society
a
short
time
ago
the
wife
of
a
peasant
came
to
the
justice
of
one
of
the
district
courts
in
russia
and
demanded
protection
from
the
cruelty
of
her
husband
she
proved
conclusively
by
the
aid
of
competent
witnesses
that
he
had
bound
her
naked
to
a
stake
during
the
cold
weather
on
the
street
and
asked
the
to
strike
her
and
whenever
they
refused
he
struck
her
himself
he
fastened
her
moreover
to
the
ground
put
many
stones
and
weights
on
her
and
broke
one
of
her
arms
the
court
declared
the
husband
not
it
can
not
afford
it
said
to
teach
woman
to
disobey
the
commands
of
her
panim
declared
this
to
be
by
no
means
an
extreme
or
isolated
case
and
that
few
became
known
to
the
public
through
the
courts
or
the
press
while
the
above
incident
illustrates
the
cruelty
of
the
state
towards
woman
under
the
greek
form
of
christianity
others
with
equal
pertinence
proved
the
cruelty
of
the
church
a
peasant
in
the
village
of
zelovia
baltic
having
reason
to
doubt
the
fidelity
of
his
spouse
deliberately
harnessed
her
to
a
cart
in
company
with
a
species
of
double
harness
for
which
the
lady
was
doubtless
unprepared
when
she
took
the
nuptial
then
got
into
the
cart
in
company
with
a
friend
and
drove
the
team
some
sixteen
versts
nearly
eleven
english
miles
without
sparing
the
when
he
returned
from
his
excursion
he
sheared
the
unlucky
woman
s
head
tarred
and
feathered
her
and
turned
her
out
of
doors
she
naturally
sought
refuge
and
consolation
from
her
parish
priest
but
he
sent
her
back
to
her
lord
and
master
prescribing
further
flaggellations
an
appeal
to
justice
by
the
poor
woman
and
her
relatives
resulted
in
a
and
recourse
to
a
higher
court
will
probably
terminate
in
the
same
manner

russian
songs
allude
to
woman
s
wrongs
in
the
marriage
relation
the
wife
of
a
son
living
with
his
father
is
looked
upon
as
an
additional
animal
to
be
urged
to
the
utmost
exertion
she
is
treated
almost
like
a
slave
and
with
less
consideration
than

until

so
many

no

so
long
continued
has
been
this
treatment
of

that
the

the
system
of
indulgence
is
as
marked
in
the
greek
as
in
the
catholic
church
but
under
slightly
different
aspects
the
worship
of
saints
is
an
important
part
of
the
byzantine
religion
there
are
two
saints
to
whom
if
a
person
prays
as
he
goes
out
to
commit
a
crime
however
heinous
he
takes
his
pardon
with
him
the
present
condition
of
russian
affairs
is
ascribed
by
edmond
noble
to
a
long
felt
revolt
in
the
minds
of
the
people
against
the
social
political
and
religious
system
of
that
country
while
the
peasant
implicitly
obeys
the
czar
regarding
his
position
as
divine
and
all
his
commands
as
just
there
is
an
element
that
recalls
the
former
period
of
freedom
with
intensity
of
desire
for
its
to
this
class
permeated
as
it
must
be
with
the
spirit
of
the

the
efforts
for
constitutional
change
and
what
the
world
knows
as
nihilism
are
attributable
it
is
in
reality
a
mighty
protest
against
that
christianity
which
in
destroying
political
freedom
instituted
a
monstrous
spiritual
and
material
tyranny
in
its
place
nihilism
is
not
wholly
nor
even
chiefly
a
form
of
political
change
it
has
a
depth
and
a
power
much
beyond
mere
social
or
governmental
change
it
looks
to
an
entire
overthrow
of
that
religious
system
which
permeates
and
underlies
all
moral
and
political
tyranny

class

the

in
the
subtler

refined

truly

amusement
the

still
fails
to
extend

protecting
arm
around
those
most
needing

defence

yet
fails
to
recognize
a
common
humanity

classes
of
people
old
traditional
customs
of
thought

still
prevail
and
the
men
of
a
hundred
years
hence
will
look
upon
the
present
time
with
the
same
criticising
astonishment
that
the
historian
of
today
looks
upon
the
last
century
savagery
instead
of
civilization
is
still
the
predominant
power
in
christendom
in
comparison
with
the
treatment
many
wives
receive
in
christian
lands
that
of
women
among
the
american
indians
or
the
most
savage
races
of
the
old
world
is
far
more
humane
than
shown
in
england
america
and
other
christian
lands
where
even
maternity
does
not
free
woman
from
the
coarsest
brutality
upon
the
part
of
husbands
nor
the
illness
incident
upon
bringing
a
new
being
into
the
world
from
writs
of
contempt
even
though
the
death
of
mother
or
babe
result
in
the
press
of

the
case
of

who
was

thousandth

booth

darkest
england
relates
a
somewhat
parallel
case
parallel
in
so
far
as
it
shows
the
enslaved
condition
of
the
english
wife
under
present
christian
laws
a
woman
who
lived
just
opposite
had
been
cruelly
kicked
and
cursed
by
her
husband
who
had
finally
bolted
the
door
against
her
and
she
had
turned
to
barbie
as
the
only
hope
barbie
took
her
in
with
her
rough
and
ready
kindness
got
her
to
bed
and
was
both
nurse
and
doctor
for
the
poor
woman
till
her
child
was
born
and
laid
in
the
mother
s
arms
not
daring
to
be
absent
longer
she
got
up
as
best
she
could
and
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
down
the
little
steep
steps
across
the
street
and
back
to
her
own
door
it
might
have
cost
the
woman
her
life
to
be
absent
from
her
home
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
that
brutal
men
exist
everywhere
that
women
and
children
are
in
all
lands
abused
that
with
its
concomitants
of
broken
jaws
noses
heads
takes
place
in
christian
lands
are
undeniable
facts
usually
although
in
defiance
of
law
and
subjecting
their
perpetrators
to
punishment
but
the
peculiarity
of
the
cases
noted
and
of
ten
thousand
others
is
that
they
are
done
under
the
authority
of
the
law
to
a
being
whom
the
law
seems
not
bound
to
protect
no
husbands
in
the
world
are
more
brutal
than
englishmen
into
whose
hands
the
wife
is
given
by
law
and
he
protected
by
the
law
in
his
of
her
it
is
christian
law
of
which
complaint
is
made
it
is
the
effect
of
christian
civilization
in
its
treatment
of
woman
to
which
attention
is
called
darkest
england
furnishes
still
fuller
statements
of
woman
s
degraded
condition
in
that
country
in
the
opening
pages
of
that
work
it
is
said
hard
it
is
no
doubt
to
read
in
stanley
s
pages
of
the
coldly
arranging
for
the
surprise
of
a
village
the
capture
of
the
inhabitants
the
massacre
of
those
who
resist
and
the
violation
of
all
the
women
but
the
stony
streets
of
london
if
they
could
but
speak
would
tell
of
tragedies
as
awful
of
ruin
as
complete
of
ravishments
as
horrible
as
if
we
were
in
central
africa
only
the
ghostly
devastation
is
covered
with
the
artificialities
of
modern
civilization
the
lot
of
a
negress
in
the
equatorial
forest
is
not
perhaps
a
very
happy
one
but
is
it
so
much
worse
than
that
of
many
a
pretty
orphan
girl
s
in
our
christian
capital
we
talk
about
the
brutalities
of
the
dark
ages
and
we
profess
to
shudder
as
we
read
in
the
books
of
the
shameful
exactions
of
the
rights
of
feudal
superiors
and
yet
here
beneath
our
very
eyes
in
our
theaters
in
our
restaurants
and
in
many
other
places
unspeakable
it
be
enough
but
to
name
it
the
same
hideous
abuse
flourishes
unchecked
a
young
penniless
girl
if
she
be
pretty
is
often
hunted
from
pillar
to
post
by
her
employers
confronted
always
by
the
or
sin
darkest
england
like
darkest
africa
reeks
with
malaria
it
should
be
impressed
upon
the
mind
that
difference
between
darkest
africa
and
darkest
england
lies
in
the
two
facts
that
one
is
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
savage
races
who
are
in
the
very
night
of
barbarism
while
the
other
is
the
moral
darkness
of
christian
civilization
in
the
very
center
of
christendom
after
years
of
church
teaching
and
priestly
influence
a
few
years
since
in
massachusetts
an
action
for
cruelty
on
part
of
a
husband
came
before
a
court
the
charge
being
that
he
came
home
one
night
in
february
when
the
thermometer
was
ten
degrees
below
zero
and
turned

his

s
mother
of
eighty
out
of
the
house
while
the
wife
was
giving
testimony
the
judge
interrupted
saying
the
husband
had
a
right
to
do
so
there
was
a
quarrel
between
the
husband
and
wife
and
he
had
a
legal
right
to
turn
her
out
and
take
possession
of
the
house
that
was
not
cruelty
from
the
newspapers
of
april
we
learn
that
at
salem
thomas
true
drove
his
wife
out
of
doors
and
swore
he
would
kill
any
one
who
would
give
her
shelter
robert
miller
took
her
into
his
house
and
was
killed
by
true
the
system
of
marriage
recognized
by
the
church
has
ever
been
that
of
ownership
and
power
by
the
husband
and
father
over
the
wife
and
children
and
during
the
middle
ages
the
ban
of
the
church
fell
with
equal
force
upon
the
woman
who
for
any
cause
left
her
husband
as
upon
the
witch
the
two
were
under
the
same
ban
as
the
excommunicated
denounced
as
one
whom
all
others
must
shun
whom
no
one
must
succor
or
harbor
and
with
whom
it
was
unlawful
to
hold
any
species
of
intercourse
the
boycott
is
not
an
invention
of
the
present
century
but
was
in
use
many
hundred
years
since
against
a
recalcitrant
wife
under
sanction
of
both
church
and
state
the
advertisements
of
absconding
wives
seen
at
the
present
day
whom
the
husband
sets
forth
as
having
left
his
bed
and
board
and
whom
all
persons
are
thereafter
forbidden
to
trust
upon
his
account
are
but
a
reminiscence
of
the
of
former
years
when
all
persons
were
forbidden
to
harbor
her
under
penalty
unless
it
could
be
proven
that
her
life
was
in
danger
without
such
aid
the
husband
was
held
to
possess
vested
rights
in
the
wife
not
only
as
against
herself
but
as
against
the
world
and
it
is
not
half
a
decade
since
the
notice
below
appeared
in
a
kansas
paper
accompanied
by
the
cut
of
a
fleeing
woman
a
capture
a
woman
who
ran
away
from
her
husband
at
lawrence
some
time
ago
was
found
at
fort
leavenworth
yesterday
by
a
lawrence
detective
and
taken
back
to
her
home
the
officer
received
a
reward
of
for
her
this
advertisement
and
others
of
a
similar
character
to
be
seen
in
the
daily
and
weekly
press
of
the
country
are
undeniable
proofs
of
the
low
condition
under
the
law
of
woman
in
the
marriage
relation
and
read
very
much
like
the
notices
in
regard
to
absconding
slaves
a
few
years
since
kansas
was
one
of
the
very
first
states
which
recognized
the
right
of
a
married
mother
to
her
own
child
that
provision
having
been
incorporated
in
its
constitution
at
early
date
as
an
enticement
for
bringing
women
emigrants
into
that
state
at
a
period
when
the
and
contests
within
its
borders
had
made
it
bloody
ground
although
the
married
woman
s
property
law
and
the
spirit
of
free
thought
has
rendered
such
action
less
frequent
than
formerly
it
is
less
than
forty
years
as
before
noted
since
the
new
york
court
of
common
pleas
rendered
a
judgment
of
in
favor
of
a
husband
against
the
relatives
of
his
wife
who
at
her
own
request
harbored
and
sheltered
her
the
christian
principle
of
man
s
ownership
of
woman
for
many
hundred
years
under
english
law
rendered
the
party
giving
shelter
to
a
fleeing
wife
liable
to
the
husband
in
money
damages
upon
the
ground
of
having
aided
a
runaway
servant
to
the
master
s
injury
under
but
one
circumstance
was
such
shelter
admissible
in
case
the
wife
was
in
danger
of
perishing
she
could
be
harbored
until
morning
when
she
must
be
returned
to
her
master
by
the
person
who
had
thus
temporarily
taken
care
of
his
perishable
property
in
england
as
late
as
the
case
of
a
cochrane
who
had
lived
apart
from
her
husband
for
years
and
showing
another
phase
of
property
law
in
the
wife
came
up
before
judge
coleridge
her
character
was
not
at
all
impeached
but
she
indulged
in
amusements
which
her
husband
considered
reprehensible
and
through
stratagem
she
was
brought
to
his
lodgings
and
there
kept
a
prisoner
a
writ
of
being
sued
out
the
husband
was
compelled
to
bring
her
before
the
court
of
the
queen
s
bench
the
decision
of
the
judge
rendered
in
favor
of
the
husband
s
right
of
forcible
detention
was
declared
by
him
to
be
upon
ground
that
english
law
virtually
considered
the
wife
as
being
under
the
guardianship
of
the
husband
not
a
person
in
her
own
right
and
this
distinctly
upon
the
ground
of
her
perpetual
infancy
she
must
be
restored
to
her
husband
as
late
as
the
rights
of
england
called
attention
to
the
suit
of
a

for
the
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
and
custody
of

been
much
advanced
by
the

of
late

has

not

a
man

himself
under
an
overseer
he
is
not
a
subordinate
in
his

the

less
energetic

hollow
of

of
which
owe
their

enforced
by
the
peculiar

a

by

prussia

under

odium

valid
without

of
the
church
the
celebrated
godin
founder
of

at

was
married
in
under
civil
form
to
a

member
of

reform
have
the
honor
of
announcing
to
you
the
purely
civil
marriage
which
they
contracted
at
guise
the
day
of
july
that
they
might
manifest
to
all
their
union
and
the
common
purpose
of
all
the
efforts
of
their
lives
civil
marriage
where
the
church
is
supreme
is
followed
by
excommunication
and
odious
insults
in
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
kind
occurred
in
the
city
of
concepcion
chili
a
young
couple
were
married
with
consent
of
their
parents
according
to
the
civil
law
their
social
and
political
prominence
made
the
occasion
conspicuous
as
it
was
the
first
wedding
among
the
aristocracy
in
that
country
dispensing
with
the
aid
of
a
priest
the
church
paper
edited
by
a
jesuit
priest
thus
commented
the
libertad
calls
this
a
happy
union
but
it
should
remember
that
happy
unions
of
this
sort
have
hitherto
existed
only
in
the
animal
kingdom
the
bride
groom
and
all
their
families
suffered
excommunication
from
the
church
but
it
is
not
alone
the
catholic
church
which
desires
to
retain
its
hold
upon
marriage
less
than
two
years
since
certain
clergymen
of
the
anglican
church
agreed
to
officiate
at
marriage
without
a
fee
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
control
of
this
relation
and
so
strong
has
been
the
influence
of
the
church
during
the
ages
that
few
people
look
upon
a
ceremony
under
the
civil
law
with
the
same
respect
as
one
performed
by
a
priest
even
of
a
protestant
denomination
the
control
of
marriage
by
the
church
while
throwing
wealth
into
its
own
coffers
has
ever
had
a
prejudicial
effect
upon
morals
as
impediments
to
marriage
of
whatever
character
increase
immorality
in
the
city
of
concepcion
referred
to
of
inhabitants
there
are
two
thousand
children
of
unknown
parentage
in
statistics
showed
per
cent
of
the
children
to
be
illegitimate
the
parents
of
those
little
ones
were
mostly
known
being
persons
too
poor
to
pay
the
cost
of
a
church
marriage
dollars
its
price
being
quite
beyond
the
means
of
the
humbler
classes
the
liberal
party
in
establishing
civil
marriage
as
legitimate
authorized
any
magistrate
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
furnish
a
certificate
for
cents
this
assault
upon
the
ancient
prerogative
of
the
church
depriving
priests
of
the
largest
source
of
their
revenue
at
once
made
a
issue
of
the
question
the
church
taking
strenuous
action
against
all
connected
with
framing
the
law
and
its
repeal
became
the
prominent
political
issue
to
aid
which
all
the
faithful
were
called
using
its
old
weapons
the
church
through
the
archbishop
issued
an
edict
excommunicating
the
president
of
the
republic
the
members
of
his
cabinet
and
the
members
of
congress
who
voted
for
the
statute
directing
that
a
similar
penalty
should
fall
upon
every
communicant
who
obeyed
it
and
neglected
to
recognize
the
church
as
the
only
authority
competent
to
solemnize
the
marriage
rite
a
correspondent
of
the
york
in
chili
wrote
this
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
on
the
one
hand
the
state
declared
all
marriages
not
under
the
civil
law
illegal
and
their
issue
illegitimate
refusing
to
recognize
rites
performed
by
the
priests
on
the
other
those
who
obey
the
law
are
excommunicated
from
the
church
and
their
cohabitation
forbidden
by
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authority
thus
matrimony
is
practically
forbidden
and
those
who
choose
to
enter
it
have
their
choice
between
arrest
and
excommunication
a
young
member
of
congress
a
man
of
gifts
and
influence
who
stands
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
liberal
party
and
who
voted
and
argued
for
civil
marriage
is
engaged
to
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
merchant
with
proud
lineage
and
aristocratic
connections
he
is
willing
to
accept
the
civil
authority
which
he
helped
to
create
and
she
and
her
father
are
also
willing
but
her
mother
is
a
devout
church
woman
and
can
not
regard
marriage
as
sacred
without
the
blessing
of
a
priest
she
favors
the
alliance
but
insists
that
the
church
shall
be
recognized
the
bishop
declines
to
permit
the
ceremony
unless
the
young
man
shall
go
to
the
confessional
and
retract
his
political
record
with
a
vow
to
hereafter
remain
steadfast
to
the
church
this
he
refuses
to
do
the
couple
will
go
to
europe
or
the
states
and
there
have
the
ceremony
performed
this
action
of
the
chilian
republic
in
substituting
a
civil
for
a
religious
ceremony
in
marriage
and
declaring
the
latter
to
be
illegal
is
a
most
important
step
in
civilization
of
which
freedom
for
woman
is
such
an
essential
factor
and
its
results
in
that
country
must
be
left
in
woman
s
every
relation
of
life
promoting
and
security
in
place
of
the
degradation
and
fear
to
which
its
church
has
so
long
condemned
her
it
is
of
indisputed
historic
record
that
both
the
christian
church
and
the
christian
state
in
different
centuries
and
under
a
number
of
differing
circumstances
gave
their
influence
in
favor
of
polygamy
the
roman
emperor
valentinian
i
in
the
fourth
century
authorized
christians
to
take
two
wives
in
the
eighth
century
the
great
charlemagne
holding
power
over
both
church
and
state
in
his
own
person
practiced
polygamy
having
six
or
according
to
some
authorities
nine
wives
with
the
reformation
this
system
entered
protestantism
as
the
first
synod
in
north
america
was
called
for
the
purpose
of
trying
a
woman
for
heresy
so
the
first
synod
of
the
reformation
was
assembled
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
polygamy
thus
farther
debasing
woman
in
the
marital
relation
the
great
german
reformer
luther
although
perhaps
himself
free
from
the
lasciviousness
of
the
old
priesthood
was
not
strictly
monogamic
in
principle
when
applied
to
by
philip
landgrave
of
hesse
cassel
for
permission
to
marry
a
second
wife
while
his
first
wife
margaret
of
savoy
was
still
living
he
called
together
a
synod
of
six
of
the
principal
and
bucer
among
in
joint
consultation
decided
that
as
the
bible
nowhere
condemns
polygamy
and
as
it
has
been
invariably
practiced
by
the
highest
dignitaries
of
the
church
such
marriage
was
legitimate
and
the
required
permission
was
given
luther
himself
with
both
the
old
and
the
new
testaments
in
hand
saying
i
confess
for
my
part
that
if
a
man
wishes
to
marry
two
or
more
wives
i
can
not
forbid
him
nor
is
his
conduct
repugnant
to
the
holy
thus
we
have
the
degrading
proof
that
the
doctrine
of
polygamy
was
brought
into
reformation
by
its
earliest
promoters
under
assertion
that
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
bible
or
the
principles
of
the
gospel
the
whole
course
of
luther
during
the
reformation
proved
his
disbelief
in
the
equality
of
woman
with
man
when
he
left
the
catholic
church
he
took
with
him
the
old
theory
of
her
created
subordination
it
was
his
maxim
that
no
gown
or
garment

luther
s
views
regarding
polygamy
have
been
endorsed
and
sanctioned
since
that
period
by
men
eminent
in
church
and
state
lord
seldon
known
as
the
light
of
england
in
the
seventeenth
century
published
a
work
under
title
of
uxor
haebraica
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
polygamy
was
permitted
to
the
hebrews
his
arguments
were
accepted
by
the
church
as
indisputable
bishop
burnet
who
while
holding
the
great
protestant
episcopal
see
of
salisbury
so
successfully
opposed
the
plan
inaugurated
by
queen
anne
for
the
establishment
of
a
woman
s
college
in
england
added
to
his
infamy
by
writing
a
tract
entitled
is
a
plurality
of
wives
in
any
case
lawful
under
the
gospel
this
question
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
sustaining
the
rightfulness
of
polygamy
under
the
christian
dispensation
quoting
the
words
of
christ
upon
divorce
he
said
we
must
not
by
a
consequence
condemn
a
plurality
of
wives
since
it
seems
not
to
have
fallen
within
the
scope
of
what
our
lord
does
there
disapprove
therefore
i
see
nothing
so
strong
against
a
plurality
of
wives
as
to
balance
the
great
and
visible
imminent
hazards
that
hang
over
so
many
thousands
if
it
be
not
allowed
the
famous
puritan
poet
of
england
john
milton
known
in
the
university
as
the
lady
of
christ
college
writing
upon
the
special
government
of
man
says
i
have
not
said
the
marriage
of
one
man
with
one
woman
lest
i
should
by
implication
charge
the
holy
patriarchs
and
pillars
of
our
faith
abraham
and
others
who
had
more
than
one
wife
at
the
same
time
with
habitual
sin
and
lest
i
should
be
forced
to
exclude
from
the
sanctuary
of
god
as
spurious
the
whole
offspring
which
sprang
from
them
yea
the
whole
of
the
sons
of
israel
for
whom
the
sanctuary
itself
was
made
for
it
is
said
in
deuteronomy
xxii
a
bastard
shall
not
enter
into
the
congregation
of
jehovah
even
to
the
tenth
either
therefore
polygamy
is
a
true
marriage
or
all
children
born
in
that
state
are
spurious
which
would
include
the
whole
race
of
jacob
the
twelve
tribes
chosen
by
god
but
as
such
an
assertion
would
be
absurd
in
the
extreme
not
to
say
impious
and
as
it
is
the
height
of
injustice
as
well
as
an
example
of
the
most
dangerous
tendency
in
religion
to
account
as
sins
what
is
not
such
in
reality
it
appears
to
me
that
so
far
from
the
question
respecting
the
lawfulness
of
polygamy
being
trivial
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
it
should
be
decided
not
a
trace
appears
of
the
interdiction
of
polygamy
throughout
the
whole
law
not
even
in
any
of
the
prophets
the
paradise
lost
of
milton
is
responsible
among
english
speaking
people
for
many
existing
views
that
are
inimical
to
woman
and
while
his
essays
upon
liberty
have
been
of
general
beneficial
influence
upon
the
world
his
particular
teachings
in
regard
to
woman
have
seriously
injured
civilization
this
man
of
polygamous
beliefs
this
tyrant
over
his
own
household
who
could
not
gain
the
love
of
either
whom
he
had
of
daughters
did
much
to
popularize
the
idea
of
woman
s
subordination
to
man
he
for
god
she
for
god
in
him
as
expressed
by
the
lips
of
eve
and
so
often
quoted
as
proclaiming
the
true
relationship
between
husband
and
wife
in
the
line
god
thy
law
thou
while
the
record
of
milton
s
life
shows
him
to
have
been
an
intolerable
domestic
tyrant
yet
for
the
wife
who
could
not
live
with
him
the
daughters
whom
social
conditions
and
lack
of
education
deprived
of
the
necessary
means
for
their
support
thus
compelling
them
to
remain
his
victims
looking
forward
to
his
death
as
their
only
means
of
release
the
world
has
as
yet
exhibited
but
little
sympathy
his
genius
undisputed
as
its
record
must
be
in
many
directions
has
made
his
views
of
overpowering
influence
upon
the
world
since
his
day
but
above
all
more
than
all
that
created
and
sustained
this
influence
were
his
views
as
to
the
polygamous
rights
of
man
his
depictment
of
eve
as
looking
upward
to
adam
as
her
god
and
his
general
maintenance
of
the
teaching
of
the
church
in
regard
to
woman
although
it
has
been
affirmed
that
after
his
blindness
he
dictated
his
great
epic
to
his
daughter
and
a
scotch
artist
has
painted
a
scene
a
picture
owned
by
the
lenox
library
yet
this
is
one
of
the
myths
men
call
history
and
amuse
themselves
in
believing
voltaire
declared
history
to
be
only
a
parcel
of
tricks
we
play
with
the
dead
and
this
tale
of
blind
milton
dictating
paradise
lost
to
his
daughters
is
a
trick
designed
to
play
upon
our
sympathies
old
johnson
is
authority
for
the
statement
that
milton
would
not
allow
his
daughters
to
learn
to
write
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
did
not
permit
them
a
knowledge
of
any
language
except
the
english
saying
one
tongue
is
enough
for
a
between
milton
and
his
family
it
is
known
there
was
tyranny
upon
one
side
hatred
upon
the
other
the
number
of
eminent
protestants
both
lay
and
clerical
who
have
sanctioned
polygamy
has
not
been
small
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
former
capuchin
monk
a
general
of
that
order
who
had
been
converted
to
the
protestant
faith
published
a
work
entitled
dialogues
in
favor
of
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
john
lyser
another
divine
of
the
reformed
church
strongly
defended
it
in
a
work
entitled
polygamia
triumphatrix
or
the
triumphant
defense
of
polygamy
rev
madden
still
another
protestant
divine
in
a
treatise
called
thalypthora
maintained
that
paul
s
injunction
that
bishops
should
be
the
husbands
of
one
wife
signified
that
laymen
were
permitted
to
marry
more
than
one
the
scholarly
william
ellery
channing
could
find
no
prohibition
of
polygamy
in
the
new
testament
in
his
remarks
on
the
character
and
writings
of
john
milton
he
says
we
believe
it
to
be
an
indisputable
fact
that
although
christianity
was
first
preached
in
asia
which
had
been
from
the
earliest
days
the
seat
of
polygamy
the
apostles
never
denounced
it
as
a
crime
and
never
required
their
converts
to
put
away
all
wives
but
one
no
express
prohibition
of
polygamy
is
found
in
the
new
that
eminent
american
divine
henry
ward
beecher
the
influence
of
whose
opinions
over
all
classes
was
for
many
years
so
great
as
to
constitute
him
a
veritable
protestant
pope
in
the
united
states
a
few
years
before
his
death
was
selected
to
reply
at
a
new
england
dinner
to
a
toast
upon
the
mormon
question
the
subject
of
polygamy
then
being
under
discussion
by
congress
he
not
only
deprecated
the
use
of
force
in
its
suppression
but
quoted
milton
in
seeming
approval
we
can
therefore
consistently
rank
beecher
as
among
the
number
of
protestant
divines
who
believed
there
was
scriptural
warrant
for
this
degradation
of
woman
but
it
is
not
alone
to
the
action
of
christian
monarchs
or
the
opinion
of
jurists
and
ministers
that
we
must
solely
look
but
also
to
the
action
of
the
church
as
a
body
during
different
periods
of
its
history
in
the
year
the
question
of
polygamy
came
up
before
the
american
board
of
commissioners
for
foreign
missions
in
the
united
states
through
a
committee
of
which
the
eminent
chancellor
walworth
of
new
york
was
chairman
this
body
reported
against
instructing
missionaries
to
exclude
polygamists
from
the
church
this
report
was
adopted
without
a
dissenting
voice
this
discussion
brought
out
some
interesting
facts
having
especial
bearing
upon
the
views
of
those
churches
which
numbered
polygamists
among
their
communicants
it
was
shown
that
the
secretaries
of
the
board
appeared
to
consider
the
existence
of
polygamy
in
the
churches
as
so
entirely
a
frivolous
question
that
even
after
it
was
especially
brought
to
their
notice
they
forbore
to
make
inquiries
and
even
when
polygamists
had
actually
been
admitted
into
the
mission
churches
no
taint
of
disapproval
had
been
made
by
the
prudential
committee
the
whole
subject
was
left
to
the
decision
of
the
missionaries
themselves
one
of
whom
published
his
views
in
the
after
prevising
that
the
bible
was
their
rule
of
faith
he
asks
is
it
not
evident
from
paul
s
instruction
respecting
the
qualifications
of
a
bishop
that
he
should
be
the
husband
of
one
wife
that
polygamy
was
permitted
in
the
primitive
church
under
the
apostles
and
that
too
in
circumstances
precisely
similar
to
those
in
which
churches
are
gathered
among
the
heathen
at
the
present
day
if
so
why
should
a
different
standard
be
set
up
than
that
set
up
by
the
apostles
that
polygamy
is
not
regarded
as
contrary
to
the
principles
of
christianity
was
again
most
forcibly
shown
in
its
endorsement
by
missionaries
located
in
those
countries
where
this
custom
prevails
one
of
the
most
notable
instances
of
recent
church
action
in
recognizing
polygamy
as
sustained
by
christianity
occurred
a
few
years
since
in
calcutta
during
a
conference
upon
the
question
this
body
was
convened
by
the
missionaries
of
england
and
america
located
in
india
its
immediate
cause
was
the
application
of
indian
converts
the
husbands
of
several
wives
for
admission
to
the
church
a
missionary
conference
of
the
several
christian
denominations
was
therefore
called
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
upon
this
grave
request
it
included
representatives
of
the
episcopal
baptist
presbyterian
and
congregationalist
churches
taking
the
bible
as
authority
full
consideration
was
given
to
the
subject
quotations
from
that
holy
book
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
conference
that
not
alone
did
the
bible
favor
polygamy
but
that
god
himself
endorsed
regulated
and
sustained
the
institution
in
addition
it
was
declared
that
these
converted
polygamists
had
given
credible
evidence
of
their
personal
the
conference
therefore
unanimously
rendered
favorable
decision
for
retention
of
the
polygamous
members
within
the
respective
churches
to
which
they
belonged
upon
the
ground
that
as
both
the
jews
and
the
early
christians
had
practiced
polygamy
it
was
allowable
to
the
new
converts
if
a
convert
before
becoming
a
christian
has
married
more
wives
than
one
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
jewish
and
primitive
christian
churches
he
shall
be
permitted
to
keep
them
all
yet
apparently
as
a
concession
to
the
somewhat
altruistic
civilization
of
the
present
age
which
outside
of
the
church
does
not
look
upon
polygamous
marriages
with
favor
such
persons
were
declared
ineligible
to
any
office
in
the
church
rev
david
allen
missionary
of
the
american
board
in
india
for
years
and
from
whose
report
of
the
action
of
the
missionary
conference
the
above
facts
were
gained
said
if
polygamy
was
unlawful
then
leah
was
the
only
wife
of
jacob
and
none
but
her
children
were
legitimate
rachel
as
well
as
bilhah
and
zilpah
were
merely
mistresses
and
their
children
six
in
number
were
bastards
the
offspring
of
adulterous
connection
and
yet
there
is
no
intimation
of
any
such
views
and
feelings
in
laban
s
family
or
in
jacob
s
family
or
in
jewish
history
bilhah
and
zilpah
are
called
jacob
s
wives
genesis
xxxvii
god
honored
the
sons
of
rachael
bilhah
and
zilpah
equally
with
the
sons
of
leah
made
them
patriarchs
of
seven
of
the
tribes
of
the
nation
and
gave
them
equal
inheritances
in
canaan
thus
the
endorsement
of
polygamy
as
not
contrary
to
the
bible
or
to
christianity
is
shown
by
action
of
christian
churches
both
in
the
united
states
and
india
within
the
present
century
and
we
can
readily
understand
why
a
gentleman
from
the
new
england
states
traveling
in
utah
said
mormonism
seems
a
very
devout
sect
of
the
christian
church
differing
but
little
from
the
great
body
of
christian
nor
is
this
judgment
at
all
strange
as
we
find
polygamy
endorsed
by
the
majority
of
christian
sects
nor
can
we
be
surprised
that
the
mormons
of
utah
and
the
adjoining
states
should
look
upon
the
opposition
of
the
united
states
to
their
practice
of
polygamy
as
an
unjust
interference
with
an
established
custom
of
the
christian
church
recognized
and
indorsed
through
the
ages
as
not
alone
part
of
the
jewish
and
early
christian
practice
but
permitted
as
allowable
at
the
present
day
president
eliot
of
harvard
speaking
in
salt
lake
city
compared
the
mormons
to
the
puritans
thus
throwing
the
weight
of
his
statement
as
to
the
harmony
between
mormonism
and
other
christian
sects
the
rochester
in
forgetfulness
of
early
puritan
history
says
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
from
what
point
of
view
president
eliot
took
his
observation
and
refers
to
mormon
contempt
and
debasement
of
womanhood
mormon
discouragement
of
intelligence
and
education
among
its
dupes
and
victims
etc
the
has
apparently
forgotten
the
trial
of
women
for
heresy
by
the
puritans
their
imprisonment
heavily
ironed
in
airless
jails
for
the
crime
of
religious
free
thought
the
flogging
of
naked
women
on
boston
common
by
the
puritans
for
free
speech
and
their
being
executed
as
witches
in
the
puritan
colony
of
massachusetts
the
has
apparently
forgotten
that
although
the
first
money
given
for
the
foundation
of
harvard
itself
was
by
a
woman
her
sex
dupe
and
victim
is
still
denied
the
full
advantage
of
education
in
that
institution
it
forgets
that
although
the
first
plot
of
ground
for
a
free
school
in
the
puritan
colony
of
massachusetts
was
given
by
a
woman
girls
were
denied
education
even
in
common
schools
until
it
became
necessary
to
permit
their
attendance
during
the
summer
months
while
the
boys
were
engaged
in
fishing
in
order
to
retain
possession
of
school
moneys
the
seems
unaware
of
the
vigorous
letter
of
hannah
adams
wife
of
the
second
president
of
the
united
states
to
her
husband
john
adams
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
first
congress
in
reference
to
the
need
of
education
for
women
should
the
pursue
its
investigations
still
farther
it
will
find
the
puritans
connected
with
the
most
serious
crimes
against
humanity
it
will
discover
priestly
and
governmental
usurpation
puritan
fanaticism
and
bigotry
even
puritan
when
president
eliot
favorably
compared
the
christian
puritans
and
the
christian
mormons
he
spoke
both
as
a
close
reader
of
puritan
history
and
a
close
observer
of
mormon
history
his
declaration
of
their
similarity
to
each
other
can
not
be
denied
by
the
candid
historian
building
upon
the
same
common
foundation
acknowledging
the
same
common
origin
the
doctrines
of
the
two
systems
necessarily
bear
close
resemblance
to
each
other
under
the
christian
theory
regarding
woman
her
origin
and
her
duties
it
should
not
be
regarded
as
at
all
strange
that
polygamy
should
find
defenders
in
the
christian
world
nor
is
it
to
be
looked
upon
as
at
all
as
surprising
that
the
mormons
the
most
recent
protestant
sect
should
teach
polygamy
as
a
divinely
organized
institution
nor
that
their
arguments
in
its
favor
should
be
drawn
from
the
bible
and
not
from
the
book
of
mormon
that
polygamy
was
not
an
original
mormon
tenet
is
well
known
it
was
derived
from
a
professed
revelation
to
joseph
smith
sustained
by
biblical
authority
the
polygamous
mahommedans
regard
christ
as
a
prophet
the
same
as
the
mormons
respect
the
authority
of
the
bible
the
mormon
marriage
formula
directs
the
man
to
look
to
god
but
enjoins
the
woman
to
look
toward
her
husband
as
god
rendering
him
the
same
unquestioning
obedience
that
has
been
demanded
from
all
christian
wives
through
the
ages

young
s
daughter
dora
with
five
of
her
sisters
was
expelled
a
few
years
since
from
the
mormon
church
for
having
gone
to
law
with
certain
of
the
mormon
brethren
who
attempted
to
rob
them
of
their
patrimony
the
elders
realizing

injury
these
women
might

of
teachers
to
interview
dora
invoking
her
father
s
name
to
influence
her
dropping
the
suit
and
return
to
the
church
dora
had
been
aroused
by
a
sense
of
the
iniquity
of
the
church
through
hearing
its
elders
declare
upon
oath
that
they
knew
nothing
of
polygamous
marriage
ceremonies
being
performed
while
the
same
day
of
this
denial
no
less
than
fourteen
such
marriages
had
taken
place
at
the
endowment
house
referring
to
the
conscientious
belief
held
by

dora
said
since
my
eyes
have
been
opened
i
sometimes
ask
myself
how
i
could
ever
possibly
have
regarded
the
horrible
and
licentious
practices
of
which
i
was
aware
and
the
terrible
things
i
have
witnessed
with
anything
but
horror
and
yet
i
was
brought
up
to
consider
these
things
right
and
i
thought
nothing
about
as
i
suppose
children
brought
up
where
human
sacrifices
are
offered
learn
to
regard
such
sacrifice
as
right
and
to
look
upon
them
with
indifference
experience
taught
dora
that
the
natural
character
of
the
human
mind
soon
accommodates
itself
to
circumstances
becomes
in
accord
with
its
environment
and
regards
as
right
whatever
law
or
custom
teaches
is
right
this
called
the
conservative
tendency
of
the
human
mind
is
merely
the
result
of
habitude
of
thought
induced
by
authoritative
teaching
both
church
and
state
have
availed
themselves
of
the
influence
of
authoritative
custom
for
the
perpetuation
of
power
in
this
way
despotism
has
gained
its
chief
victories
the
beliefs
to
which
persons
have
been
habituated
from
childhood
are
without
investigation
deemed
truths
by
the
majority
of
the
world
no
step
so
great
in
its
results
as
that
of
independent
thought
none
so
greatly
feared
by
priestly
and
civil
power
and
among
women
during
the
christian
ages
none
has
met
with
such
swift
rebuke
no
sin
has
been
characterized
as
its
equal
in
malignancy
therefore
while
the
world
has
possessed
full
knowledge
of
man
s
opinions
regarding
polygamy
not
until
the
present
century
and
in
the
united
states
have
the
views
of
women
been
attainable
until
the
present
age
there
has
been
no
escape
from
bondage
for
the
polygamous
wife
no
opportunity
for
learning
its
effects
upon
her
own
inner
self
from
the
daughter
of
its
chief
prophet
the
man
whose
fame
in
connection
with
polygamy
has
gone
throughout
the
world
we
have
learned
something
of
its
evils
as
seen
and
felt
by
woman
yet
other
and
still
stronger
testimony
is
not
lacking
a
private
letter
written
in
salt
lake
city
a
few
years
since
published
in
the
under
head
of
the
silent
woes
of
mormonism
depicts
one
phase
in
its
influence
upon
the
unborn
a
few
years
ago
an
educated
young
journalist
came
to
salt
lake
city
from
europe
with
his
young
wife
both
became
sincere
believers
in
mormonism
then
strong
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
by
the
priesthood
upon
the
husband
to
force
him
into
polygamy
the
wife
finding
opposition
in
vain
at
last
gave
her
nominal
consent
a
second
bride
was
brought
into
the
house
in
a
short
time
the
first
wife
became
a
mother
but
the
infant
never
cried
aloud
it
came
voiceless
into
the
world
but
it
wept
in
secret
all
the
time
sleeping
or
waking
the
tears
flowed
from
its
closed
eyes
and
in
a
few
weeks
it
died
the
mother
said
that
it
died
of
a
broken
heart
every
day
of
its
life
it
shed
the
tears
that
its
mother
had
repressed
before
its
birth
the
experience
of
caroline
owens
whose
suit
for
bigamy
against
her
polygamous
husband
john
miles
appealed
from
the
supreme
court
of
utah
to

of
the

suit
implicating
delegate

of
the

of

an
english
girl
acquainted
with
miles
from
her
childhood
he
had
emigrated
to
utah
but
in
england
on
a
visit
he
urged
her
to
return
with
him
promising
her
marriage
when
they
reached
salt
lake
city
she
questioned
him
as
to
polygamy
he
replied
that
a
few
old
men
were
allowed
more
than
one
wife
but
that
young
men
like
himself
had
but
one
although
he
spoke
of
one
emily
spencer
who
had
expressed
affection
for
him
but
whom
he
had
no
intention
of
marrying
upon
reaching
salt

staid
at
the
house
of
united
states
delegate
george
cannon
where
but
one
wife
resided
when
the
day
of
the
wedding
arrived
she
went
through
the
ceremonies
of
the
endowment
house
lasting
from
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
three
in
the
afternoon
and
had
been
wedded
to
john
miles
she
says
i
can
never
tell
the
horrors
of
the
next
few
hours
before
that
day
was
over
my
love
had
turned
to
burning
hatred
when
we
started
to
go
home
miles
told
me
that
he
had
invited
emily
spencer
to
our
wedding
reception
i
said
if
she
came
to
the
house
i
should
leave
he
replied
he
was
now
master
i
went
to
my
room
and
dressed
for
the
reception
which
took
place
at
cannon
s
other
house
where
he
kept
his
three
wives
when
i
went
down
there
was
a
crowd
there
among
the
rest
a
plain
looking
girl
in
a
calico
dress
to
whom
i
was
introduced
it
was
emily
spencer
i
did
not
speak
to
her
after
a
while
they
wanted
to
dance
and
asked
me
to
play
emily
spencer
sat
on
a
piano
stool
i
told
her
to
get
up
miles
came
forward
and
said
sit
still
emily
spencer
my
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
shot
i
said
your
wife
then
what
am
i
he
said
you
are
both
my
all
at
once
my
shame
flashed
over
me
here
i
was
dishonored
the
polygamous
wife
of
a
mormon
i
ran
out
of
the
house
bent
only
on
escape
i
did
not
think
where
i
could
not
do
it
though
for
miles
and
young
cannon
a
son
of
the
delegate
ran
after
me
and
dragged
me
back
we
had
been
intending
to
stay
in
the
house
all
night
but
i
stole
away
and
returned
to
the
other
house
where
i
had
been
living
the
three
weeks
since
my
arrival
from
england
i
noticed
there
was
no
key
in
the
lock
but
shot
a
little
bolt
and
piled
up
chairs
against
the
door
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
don
t
know
what
time
it
was
miles
stood
in
the
room
and
was
locking
the
door
on
the
inside
i
screamed
because
cannon
and
miles
had
been
living
in
the
house
with
me
miles
said
i
need
not
take
on
for
brother
cannon
had
anticipated
that
i
would
make
trouble
and
had
had
the
house
cleared
of
every
one
else
i
found
out
that
it
was
so
he
told
me
that
i
might
as
well
submit
there
was
no
law
here
to
control
the
saints
there
was
no
power
on
earth
that
would
save
me
she
was
subjected
to
great
brutality
again
and
again
beaten
and
exhorted
to
bear
her
condition
patiently
as
a
sister
to
be
exalted
because
of
her
rebellious
spirit
she
was
hectored
and
threatened
stoned
jeered
at
and
abused
in
many
ways
all
under
pretense
of
religion
until
after
three
weeks
of
such
matrimonial
life
she
escaped
and
among
the
gentiles
found
rest
and
help
she
speaks
of
polygamous
wives
as
poorly
fed
toiling
like
serfs
without
hope
under
the
chains
of
a
religious
despotism
mormon
polygamy
possesses
the
peculiar
feature
of
tracing
the
system
of
plural
marriage
to
the
gods
a
father
and
mother
god
and
goddess
a
grandfather
a
grandmother
god
and
goddess
and
thus
in
constantly
ascending
scale
from
these
they
claim
the
origin
of
their
own
polygamous
system
every
mormon
man
however
depraved
is
taught
that
if
he
lives
up
to
the
plural
marriage
system
upon
his
death
he
will
become
a
god
holding
power
and
procreating
children
to
all
eternity
but
should
any
mormon
however
pure
his
life
die
unmarried
he
has
forever
lost
his
opportunity
of
becoming
a
god
but
remains
simply
an
angel
a
servant
of
the
polygamous
gods
the
belief
is
inculcated
in
woman
that
to
her
marriage
is
even
more
necessary
than
to
man
without
marriage
there
is
no
resurrection
for
her
and
thus
believing
polygamy
a
requisite
for
eternal
salvation
thousands
silently
endure
the
woes
of
this
condition
this
latest
christian
sect
this
final
outgrowth
of
centuries
of
barbarous
teaching
is
the
most
determined
effort
against
the
integrity
of
womanhood
since
the
days
of
the
jewish
patriarchs
the
duty
of
giving
birth
to
numerous
children
in
order
to
save
waiting
spirits
and
to
swell
the
glory
of
the
polygamous
father
in
his
after
death
godship
is
as
thoroughly
taught
as
when
in
mediaeval
days
monk
and
priest
preached
woman
s
duty
to
constantly
add
numbers
to
the
church
the
late
helen
jackson
who
had
thoroughly
investigated
the
mormon
question
writing
of
polygamy
in
the
said
the
doctrine
to
be
completely
studied
must
be
considered
both
from
the
man
s
point
of
view
and
the
woman
s
the
two
being
for
reasons
not
identical
but
it
is
the
woman
s
view
of
it
her
belief
and
position
in
regard
to
it
which
are
most
misrepresented
and
misunderstood
by
the
world
if
the
truth
were
known
there
would
be
few
persons
in
whose
minds
would
be
any
sentiment
except
profound
pity
for
the
mormon
moreover
intensified
by
admiration
there
has
never
been
a
class
or
sect
of
women
since
the
world
began
who
have
endured
for
religion
s
sake
a
tithe
of
what
has
been
and
is
and
forever
must
be
endured
by
the
women
of
the
mormon
church
it
has
become
customary
to
hold
them
as
disreputable
women
light
and
loose
unfit
to
associate
with
the
virtuous
undeserving
of
any
esteem
never
was
greater
injustice
committed
the
two
doctrines
which
most
help
the
mormon
woman
to
endure
the
suffering
of
living
in
plural
marriage
are
the
doctrines
of
and
of
the
eternal
continuance
of
the
patriarchal
order
the
mere
revelation
from
joseph
smith
to
the
effect
that
polygamy
was
to
be
permitted
and
was
praiseworthy
and
desirable
would
never
alone
have
brought
the
mormon
women
to
hearty
acceptance
of
the
institution
they
are
taught
and
most
unquestioningly
believe
that
the
universe
is
full
of
spirits
waiting
and
waiting
impatiently
to
be
born
on
this
earth
these
spirits
have
already
passed
through
one
stage
of
discipline
and
probation
and
are
to
enter
upon
a
second
one
here
the
rev
edward
beecher
once
published
a
book
setting
forth
a
similar
doctrine
the
mormon
doctrine
goes
farther
than
beecher
s
inasmuch
as
it
teaches
that
these
spirits
may
select
of
their
own
free
will
where
and
how
they
will
be
born
into
their
earthly
probation
and
that
they
are
one
and
all
anxious
to
be
born
in
the
mormon
church
as
the
one
true
zion
where
alone
are
to
be
found
safety
and
salvation
they
also
believe
that
the
time
is
limited
during
which
these
spirits
can
avail
themselves
of
this
privilege
of
being
born
into
zion
they
look
for
the
return
of
jesus
christ
to
the
earth
before
long
and
for
the
establishment
then
of
the
millennial
dispensation
after
which
no
more
of
the
spirits
can
be
reborn
and
reclaimed
hence
the
obligation
resting
upon
every
faithful
mormon
woman
to
bring
into
the
world
in
the
course
of
her
life
as
many
children
as
possible
not
only
does
she
thus
contribute
to
the
building
up
and
strengthening
of
the
church
but
she
rescues
souls
already
existing
and
in
danger
of
eternal
death
it
is
easy
to
sneer
at
this
doctrine
as
inconceivable
rubbish
and
in
truth
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
an
educated
mind
receiving
it
but
it
is
no
more
absurd
or
unprovable
than
hundreds
of
kindred
speculations
and
notions
which
have
been
devised
preached
and
passionately
believed
in
times
past
neither
has
the
absurdity
or
falsity
or
truth
of
the
belief
anything
to
do
with
our
judgment
of
its
believers
in
furtherance
of
its
plan
for
temporal
power
the
astuteness
of
the
mormon
theocracy
is
shown
in
this
doctrine
of
spirits
continually
waiting
birth
upon
the
earth
this
together
with
its
other
theory
of
the
superior
power
and
godhood
in
a
future
life
of
the
father
of
numerous
children
imposes
the
condition
of
continual
motherhood
upon
mormon
wives
but
during
the
christian
ages
this
theory
of
woman
s
duty
to
constantly
bear
children
in
order
to
the
upholding
of
the
church
has
ever
been
taught
even
philip
melancthon
the
great
associate
of
luther
in
the
reformation
saying
if
a
woman
becomes
weary
of
bearing
children
that
matters
not
let
her
only
die
from
bearing
she
is
there
to
do
so
little
does
the
church
yet
understand
the
right
of
woman
to
an
existence
for
herself
alone
that
not
five
years
have
passed
since
a
minister
of
the
methodist
church
in
the
state
of
new
york
publicly
declared
he
saw
no
reason
for
woman
s
creation
but
the
bearing
of
children
in
a
lecture
upon
mormonism
in
boston
conyear
of
the
salt
lake
city
collegiate
institute
speaking
of
the
sufferings
endured
by
mormon
women
in
order
thus
to
secure
personal
salvation
said
hate
the
system
as
you
hate
satan
but
have
mercy
on
the
people
who
are
there
in
such
a
bondage
worse
than
that
in
which
the
negro
in
the
south
was
ever
held
but
these
doctrines
accepted
as
truth
by
devout
mormon
women
are
not
more
degrading
to
them
not
more
injurious
to
civilization
than
is
the
belief
of
orthodox
christian
women
in
regard
to
the
frailty
and
primal
sin
of
her
sex
and
the
curse
of
her
creator
upon
her
in
consequence
to
this
belief
she
has
been
trained
from
her
childhood
as
her
mother
before
her
and
her
feminine
relatives
for
innumerable
centuries
and
without
investigation
she
has
accepted
these
doctrines
of
the
church
as
true
yet
all
these
theories
so
degrading
to
woman
are
of
purely
human
masculine
origin
their
object
power
for
man
and
the
subordination
of
woman
to
him
in
every
relation
of
life
the
eternal
continuance
of
the
patriarchal
order
a
doctrine
of
the
mormons
is
paralleled
among
orthodox
christians
by
the
teaching
of
an
eternal
continuance
of
the
male
priestly
order
woman
forever
excluded
the
mormon
woman
no
more
fully
places
herself
in
position
of
servant
to
her
husband
whom
at
the
endowment
house
marriage
ceremony
she
promises
to
obey
than
has
the
orthodox
christian
woman
through
the
ages
when
she
has
promised
obedience
to
her
husband
at
the
marriage
altar
nor
is
the
general
religious
training
of
the
two
very
different
the
mormon
woman
is
taught
that
her
salvation
depends
upon
polygamous
marriage
and
her
subjection
to
her
husband
in
all
things
the
orthodox
christian
woman
is
taught
that
her
salvation
depends
upon
her
belief
that
woman
brought
sin
into
the
world
in
punishment
whereof
god
placed
her
in
subjection
to
man
and
during
the
ages
her
promise
of
obedience
to
man
has
been
held
as
an
integral
part
of
the
marriage
ceremony
nor
did
a
change
begin
to
take
place
until
after
the
inauguration
of
the
woman
suffrage
reform
not
until
woman
herself
rebelled
against
such
annihilation
of
her
own
conscience
and
responsibility
did
a
few
sects
in
some
instances
omit
this
promise
from
their
forms
of
marriage
although
it
still
remains
a
portion
of
the
greek
catholic
and
anglican
ceremony
as
well
as
of
other
protestant
sects
the
shock
of
finding
educated
women
of
new
england
birth
members
of
the
mormon
church
as
polygamous
wives
is
lessened
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
the
mormon
doctrine
in
comparison
with
those
of
orthodox
christianity
regarding
women
all
alike
rest
upon
the
same
foundation
all
teach
that
sin
entered
the
world
through
woman
all
alike
darken
the
understanding
through
such
false
teaching
the
women
of
the
mormon
church
received
their
training
under
orthodox
christianity
which
laid
the
foundation
of
their
self
contempt
with
the
professed
revelation
of
the
book
of
mormon
a
class
of
priests
arose
who
no
less
positively
and
authoritatively
asserted
its
doctrines
to
be
of
god
than
the
priesthood
of
other
divisions
of
christianity
assert
the
bible
to
be
of
god
and
alike
each
declare
themselves
and
their
followers
to
be
his
chosen
people
by
authority
of
the
priesthood
of
god
has
carried
weight
in
all
ages
and
no
greater
weight
among
the
mormons
of
the
present
day
than
among
christians
of
all
ages
under
the
christian
theory
regarding
the
origin
and
duties
of
woman
it
is
not
surprising
that
polygamy
should
ever
have
found
defenders
in
the
christian
world
nor
is
it
at
all
singular
that
mormonism
as
the
latest
founded
christian
sect
should
teach
polygamy
as
a
divinely
organized
institution
drawing
its
arguments
from
the
bible
bishop
lunt
of
that
church
defending
polygamy
as
of
divine
origin
said
god
revealed
to
joseph
smith
the
polygamous
system
it
is
quite
true
that
his
widow
declared
that
no
such
revelation
was
ever
made
but
that
was
because
she
had
lost
the
spirit
god
commanded
the
human
race
to
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
abraham
had
two
wives
and
the
almighty
honored
the
second
one
by
a
direct
communication
jacob
had
leah
and
zilpah
david
had
a
plurality
of
wives
and
was
a
man
after
god
s
own
heart
god
gave
him
saul
s
two
wives
and
only
condemned
his
adulteries
moses
gideon
and
joshua
had
each
a
plurality
of
wives
solomon
had
wives
and
concubines
by
hundreds
though
we
do
not
believe
in
the
concubine
system
we
leave
that
to
the
gentiles
virtue
and
chastity
wither
beneath
the
monogamic
institution
which
was
borrowed
from
the
pagan
nations
by
the
early
christians
it
was
prophesied
that
in
the
latter
days
seven
women
would
lay
hold
of
one
man
and
demand
to
bear
his
name
that
they
might
not
be
held
in
dishonor
the
protestants
and
catholics
assail
us
with
very
poor
grace
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
first
pillars
of
the
religion
they
claim
to
profess
were
men
like
the
saints
of
the
fact
can
not
be
denied
polygamy
is
virtually
encouraged
and
taught
by
example
by
the
old
testament
it
may
appear
shocking
and
blasphemous
to
gentiles
for
us
to
say
so
but
we
hold
that
jesus
christ
himself
was
a
polygamist
he
was
surrounded
by
women
constantly
as
the
scriptures
attest
and
those
women
were
his
polygamous
wives
the
vast
disparity
between
the
sexes
in
all
settled
communities
is
another
argument
in
favor
of
polygamy
to
say
nothing
of
the
disinclination
among
young
male
gentiles
to
marrying
the
monogamic
system
condemns
millions
of
women
to
celibacy
a
large
proportion
of
them
stray
from
the
path
of
right
and
these
unfortunates
induce
millions
of
men
to
forego
marriage
as
i
have
said
virtue
and
chastity
wither
under
the
monogamic
system
there
are
no
illegitimate
children
in
utah
there
are
no
libertines
there
are
no
brothels
excepting
where
the
presence
of
gentiles
creates
the
demand
for
them
even
then
our
people
do
what
they
can
to
root
out
such
places
there
is
a
positive
advantage
in
having
more
than
one
wife
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
gentile
home
where
comforts
and
plenty
prevail
in
which
there
is
only
one
woman
no
one
woman
can
manage
a
household
she
must
have
assistance
hence
we
claim
that
when
a
man
marries
a
second
wife
he
actually
benefits
the
first
one
and
contributes
to
her
ease
and
relieves
her
of
a
large
burden
of
care
the
duties
of
the
household
are
divided
between
the
two
women
and
everything
moves
on
harmoniously
and
peacefully
the
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
education
a
girl
reared
under
the
monogamic
system
may
look
with
abhorrence
on
ours
our
young
women
do
not
do
so
they
expect
when
they
marry
a
man
that
he
will
some
day
take
another
wife
and
they
consider
it
quite
natural
that
he
should
do
so
in
wealthy
gentile
communities
the
concubine
system
largely
takes
the
place
of
the
polygamous
system
any
man
of
intelligence
observation
and
travel
knows
that
such
is
the
case
the
fact
is
ignored
by
general
consent
and
little
is
said
about
it
and
nothing
is
written
about
it
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
proper
subject
of
conversation
or
of
publication
how
much
better
to
give
lonely
women
a
home
while
they
are
uncontaminated
and
honor
them
with
your
name
and
perpetually
provide
for
them
and
before
the
world
recognize
your
own
offspring
the
polygamous
system
is
the
only
natural
one
and
the
time
rapidly
approaches
when
it
will
be
the
most
conspicuous
and
beneficent
of
american
institutions
it
will
be
the
grand
characteristic
feature
of
american
society
our
women
are
contented
with
they
are
the
most
ardent
defenders
of
it
to
be
found
in
utah
if
the
question
were
put
to
a
vote
tomorrow
of
the
women
of
utah
would
vote
to
perpetuate
polygamy
in
line
with
other
christian
sects
mormons
claim
that
polygamy
is
countenanced
by
the
new
testament
as
well
as
by
the
old
they
interpret
paul
s
teaching
in
regard
to
bishops
while
commanding
them
to
marry
one
wife
as
also
not
prohibiting
them
from
marrying
more
than
one
their
interpretation
of
this
passage
but
slightly
varying
from
that
of
rev
madan
rev
lyford
of
the
methodist
church
long
a
resident
of
utah
does
not
fail
to
see
the
degradation
of
the
people
as
in
proportion
to
the
despotism
of
the
hierarchy
he
says
it
took
the
methodist
church
forty
years
to
get
a
membership
of
mormonism
in
years
counted
it
seems
incredible
nevertheless
it
is
a
fact
in
this
brief
space
of
time
it
has
also
been
able
to
nullify
our
laws
oppose
our
institutions
openly
perpetrate
crimes
be
represented
in
congress
boast
of
the
helplessness
of
the
nation
to
prevent
these
things
and
give
the
church
supremacy
over
the
state
and
the
people
bills
introduced
in
congress
adequate
to
their
overthrow
have
been
year
after
year
allowed
to
fall
to
the
ground
without
action
upon
them
our
public
men
can
only
pronounce
against
the
crime
of
polygamy
the
press
can
see
only
polygamy
in
utah
the
public
mind
is
impressed
with
only
the
heinousness
of
polygamy
back
of
polygamy
is
the
tree
that
produces
it
and
many
kindred
evils
more
dear
to
the
mormon
rulers
they
do
not
care
for
all
the
sentiment
or
law
against
this
one
fruit
of
the
tree
if
the
tree
itself
is
left
to
stand
the
prolific
cause
of
so
many
and
so
great
evils
in
utah
the
greatest
curse
of
the
territory
the
strength
of
mormonism
and
its
impregnable
wall
of
defense
against
christianity
and
civilization
is
that
arbitrary
despotic
and
absolute
hierarchy
known
as
the
mormon
priesthood
lyford
has
partial
insight
into
the
truth
when
he
says
back
of
polygamy
is
the
tree
that
produces
it
and
many
kindred
evils
but
in
defining
that
tree
as
the
has
not
reached
the
entire
truth
he
does
not
touch
the
ground
which
supports
the
tree
polygamy
is
but
one
development
of
the
doctrine
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
the
constant
tendency
of
which
is
to
make
her
a
mere
slave
under
every
form
of
religion
extant
and
of
which
the
complex
marriage
of
the
christian
sect
of
perfectionists
at
oneida
community
was
but
another
logical
result
when
woman
interprets
the
bible
for
herself
it
will
be
in
the
interest
of
a
higher
morality
a
purer
home
monogamy
is
woman
s
doctrine
as
polygamy
is
man
s
bachofen
the
swiss
jurist
says
that
the
regulation
of
marriage
by
which
in
primitive
times
it
became
possible
for
a
woman
to
belong
only
to
one
man
came
about
by
a
religious
reformation
wherein
the
women
in
armed
conflict
obtained
a
victory
over
men
while
the
greatest
number
of
converts
to
the
mormon
church
are
from
among
the
ignorant
peasantry
of
foreign
countries
still
no
less
than
in
orthodox
christianity
do
we
find
people
of
culture
and
education
upholding
its
doctrines
an
irrefragable
proof
that
the
power
of
religious
despotism
lies
in
two
conditions
first
ignorance
second
fear
to
fear
must
ever
be
attributed
the
great
victories
of
religious
despotism
fear
of
punishment
after
death
from
which
obedience
to
priestly
teaching
is
believed
to
free
such
slavery
of
the
human
mind
has
ever
been
the
greatest
obstacle
to
advancing
civilization
men
and
women
of
the
christian
church
not
daring
to
use
their
own
free
thought
upon
such
questions
are
no
less
bound
than
the
savage
who
makes
a
hideous
noise
in
order
to
frighten
away
the
monster
he
thinks
trying
to
swallow
the
sun
during
an
eclipse
the
strength
of
the
church
has
ever
lain
in
its
power
of
producing
fear
and
impelling
belief
in
its
assertion
that
the
priesthood
alone
can
define
the
will
of
god
and
that
as
his
chosen
servants
they
but
voice
his
will
in
every
word
they
utter
unhesitating
belief
in
this
assertion
has
been
required
through
the
christian
ages
as
evidence
of
a
true
son
or
daughter
of
the
church
while
the
cry
of
heresy
so
frightful
in
its
significance
so
terrible
in
its
punishment
under
the
priesthood
has
most
effectively
prevented
investigation
and
quenched
the
fire
of
rebellious
thought
the
mormon
priesthood
look
toward
the
establishment
of
a
temporal
kingdom
in
connection
with
their
religion
they
maintain
that
the
civil
power
inherently
belongs
to
the
theocracy
and
should
supersede
all
other
forms
of
government
like
the
priesthood
of
other
sects
they
claim
divine
guidance
in
the
promulgation
of
their
laws
as
proceeding
from
above
while
those
of
the
state
emanate
from
man
himself
and
consequently
are
not
binding
upon
the
conscience
the
church
as
a
body
ever
claiming
to
hold
the
keys
of
heaven
and
of
hell
and
the
implicit
belief
given
to
such
assertion
by
tens
and
hundreds
of
thousands
has
ever
been
a
most
powerful
method
for
subduing
the
reason
its
anathemas
its
excommunications
its
denial
of
church
rites
in
marriage
in
burial
its
control
of
both
temporal
and
spiritual
power
have
ever
made
its
weapons
of
the
most
formidable
character
fear
of
what
may
be
met
in
a
future
life
over
which
the
church
assumes
such
knowledge
and
control
subjugation
of
the
reason
the
fostering
of
ignorance
the
denial
of
education
and
the
constant
teaching
that
thought
outside
of
the
line
formulated
by
the
church
is
deepest
sin
has
held
the
christian
world
in
bondage
during
its
centuries
inasmuch
as
it
is
impossible
for
the
candid
thinker
not
to
perceive
that
all
forms
of
christianity
are
based
upon
the
statement
that
woman
having
brought
sin
into
the
world
rendered
the
sacrifice
of
a
saviour
necessary
the
reason
of
such
persistent
effort
upon
the
part
of
the
church
for
woman
s
entire
subjugation
becomes
apparent
it
is
assumed
by
all
theocracies
that
the
church
is
a
temporal
kingdom
with
supreme
right
to
the
control
of
all
civil
affairs
every
theocracy
is
therefore
a
political
system
seeking
control
of
the
civil
government
and
however
greatly
suppressed
in
action
every
theocracy
proposes
such
control
as
its
ulterior
design
early
in
an
encyclical
letter
by
the
pope
declared
the
supremacy
of
the
church
over
the
state
commanding
resistance
to
the
authority
of
the
state
in
case
of
its
conflicting
with
the
pretensions
of
the
supreme
pontiff
of
the
catholic
church
the
mormon
theocracy
and
the
catholic
here
show
their
affinity
nor
are
protestants
without
similar
pretensions
as
is
proven
by
the
action
of
the
national
reform
association
of
the
united
states
whose
aim
is
the
union
of
church
and
state
through
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
its
ultimate
purpose
being
that
of
theocratic
control
over
the
civil
government
of
this
country
these
various
bodies
are
parts
of
the
christian
party
in
politics
nor
is
this
party
of
recent
origin
as
early
as
when
composed
almost
entirely
of
protestants
its
designs
upon
the
life
of
the
republic
were
noted
by
the
eloquent
scotch
reformer
frances
wright
during
her
travels
lectures
and
residence
in
this
country
mormonism
and
catholicism
do
not
more
greatly
threaten
the
civil
and
religious
integrity
of
this
republic
than
does
the
national
reform
association
the
theocracy
of
the
protestant
church
equally
with
that
of
the
catholic
church
constantly
striving
to
incite
congressional
action
in
favor
of
obligatory
religious
teaching
and
seeking
control
of
the
common
schools
yet
the
history
of
the
world
proves
that
wherever
tried
ecclesiastical
schools
have
lowered
the
standard
of
education
today
the
schools
under
control
of
the
mormon
church
in
no
respect
equal
those
of
adjacent
territories
under
the
plea
of
religious
freedom
the
greatest
dangers
arise
while
the
mormons
affirm
in
reference
to
polygamy
that
their
church
laws
concern
mormons
alone
no
less
do
other
theocracies
inculcate
doctrines
contrary
to
civil
law
the
catholic
church
its
spirit
today
the
same
as
during
past
ages
making
civil
marriage
and
the
public
school
system
its
present
objective
points
of
opposition
to
the
state
while
the
general
body
of
protestant
churches
more
openly
than
the
catholic
churches
proclaim
their
intention
not
alone
to
control
secular
education
marriage
and
divorce
but
to
unite
church
and
state
through
a
change
in
the
fundamental
law
of
the
united
states
a
somewhat
fear
exists
in
regard
to
the
encroachment
of
catholicism
upon
civil
liberty
the
most
potent
danger
lies
elsewhere
the
most
potent
because
the
least
perceived
the
most
potent
because
arising
from
a
body
whom
the
masses
of
native
americans
through
heredity
and
training
look
upon
as
supporters
and
defenders
of
both
civil
and
religious
priesthood
of
the
orthodox
protestant
churches
mormonism
does
not
so
fully
threaten
civil
and
religious
liberty
catholicism
is
not
making
greater
encroachments
upon
them
than
are
the
great
body
of
the
protestant
clergy
under
the
name
and
the
work
of
the
national
reform
the
people
of
the
united
states
with
careless
security
in
the
power
of
the
principles
of
freedom
upon
which
the
government
is
based
fail
to
note
the
theocratic
encroachment
everywhere
threatened
the
very
nature
of
sacerdotalism
professing
as
it
every
where
does
to
hold
authority
of
a
supernatural
character
unfailingly
creates
a
claim
of
supremacy
over
civil
government
president
john
taylor
of
the
mormon
church
a
few
years
since
openly
asserted
these
claims
saying
we
are
independent
of
newspapers
independent
of
kings
independent
of
but
it
is
not
the
mormon
priesthood
alone
that
declares
its
independence
of
secular
governments
this
is
the
same
spirit
that
seen
through
the
ages
of
christianity
has
been
so
plainly
shown
by
catholicism
since
the
temporal
power
in
italy
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
secular
monarch
and
that
is
now
so
fully
a
part
of
protestant
effort
under
the
overwhelming
amount
of
biblical
proof
quoted
in
its
favor
by
the
most
eminent
legal
and
clerical
minds
of
the
christian
church
we
must
admit
the
doctrine
of
polygamy
to
be
a
component
part
of
christianity
although
like
the
fagot
and
the
stake
under
the
light
of
advancing
civilization
it
has
somewhat
fallen
into
disrepute
with
the
majority
of
men
and
women
yet
its
renewal
as
an
underlying
principle
of
a
new
christian
sect
need
not
be
a
subject
of
astonishment
the
pulpit
the
bar
and
legislative
halls
are
still
under
the
control
of
man
and
these
institutions
still
express
the
form
of
civilization
that
is
due
to
his
teachings
but
as
neither
moral
nor
intellectual
education
is
of
value
unless
founded
upon
a
material
basis
the
world
now
beginning
to
see
that
wall
street
and
the
bourse
with
their
fingers
upon
the
business
of
the
world
are
fast
becoming
of
greater
importance
in
determining
the
future
character
of
civilization
than
peter
s
the
kremlin
or
westminster
abbey
wendell
phillips
once
declared
that
the
advance
of
civilization
was
not
dependent
upon
either
the
pulpit
or
the
press
but
upon
commerce
and
a
careful
study
of
the
inventions
and
industries
of
the
age
confirm
this
statement
material
needs
underlying
all
others
direct
the
tenor
of
modern
civilization
but
commerce
of
itself
is
not
alone
responsible
within
the
past
thirty
years
a
new
element
has
widely
entered
into
the
business
of
the
world
and
even
the
most
careless
observer
can
but
in
many
ways
note
the
changing
customs
and
habits
of
business
life
and
that
under
this
change
a
new
form
of
civilization
is
dawning
upon
the
world
woman
once
so
carefully
excluded
is
now
everywhere
seen
at
the
counter
behind
the
cashier
s
desk
as
buyer
as
business
manager
and
in
many
instances
as
employer
conducting
business
for
herself
every
kind
of
industry
is
opening
to
her
from
that
of
government
employee
at
washington
with
the
financial
interests
of
the
nation
in
her
grasp
to
that
of
electrical
business
woman
is
everywhere
found
the
commerce
of
the
world
is
rapidly
changing
hands
and
the
next
quarter
of
a
century
will
find
woman
in
its
full
control
but
few
persons
foresee
the
ultimate
result
of
this
change
with
a
new
class
at
the
helm
commerce
will
give
new
ideas
to
the
world
if
christianity
survive
the
shock
of
coming
events
it
will
present
a
different
aspect
within
the
next
fifty
years
and
its
teachings
in
regard
to
woman
will
be
totally
unlike
those
of
past
ages
as
woman
comes
into
new
relations
with
the
great
institutions
of
the
world
she
will
cease
to
believe
herself
inferior
and
subordinate
to
man
polygamy
and
all
kindred
degradations
of
her
sex
will
become
things
of
the
past
and
taking
her
rightful
place
in
church
and
state
she
will
open
a
new
civilization
to
the
world
and
and
unto
adam
the
lord
said
cursed
be
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
thorns
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
herbs
of
the
field
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
till
thou
return
unto
the
ground
for
dust
thou
art
and
into
dust
thou
shalt
return
upon
man
was
pronounced
the
curse
of
the
world
s
work
the
bible
declares
it
was
because
of
sinfulness
that
the
earth
was
to
be
cursed
for
punishment
that
he
was
to
eat
of
it
in
sorrow
all
the
days
of
his
life
because
of
wickedness
that
it
was
to
bear
thorns
and
thistles
and
in
consequence
of
disobedience
that
he
was
to
eat
the
herb
of
the
field
in
the
sweat
of
his
face
until
he
returned
unto
the
ground
from
whence
he
came
no
curse
of
work
was
pronounced
upon
woman
her
curse
was
of
an
entirely
different
character
it
was
a
positive
command
of
the
lord
god
almighty
that
upon
man
alone
the
work
of
the
world
should
fall
and
this
work
he
was
to
perform
in
sorrow
and
the
sweat
of
his
brow
thus
far
this
book
has
been
devoted
to
a
consideration
of
the
doctrines
taught
by
christian
men
in
regard
to
woman
s
curse
and
so
earnestly
has
this
doctrine
been
proclaimed
that
man
seems
to
have
entirely
forgotten
the
curse
also
pronounced
upon
himself
or
if
he
has
not
forgotten
he
has
neglected
to
see
its
full
import
and
in
his
anxiety
to
keep
woman
in
subordination
he
has
placed
curse
also
upon
her
thus
thwarting
the
express
command
of
god
it
is
therefore
but
just
to
now
devote
a
few
pages
to
the
consideration
of
man
s
curse
and
an
investigation
of
the
spirit
in
which
he
has
accepted
the
penalty
imposed
upon
him
for
his
share
in
the
transgression
which
cost
him
paradise
at
the
commencement
of
this
investigation
it
will
be
well
to
remember
that
eve
was
not
banished
from
the
garden
of
eden
adam
alone
was
cast
out
and
to
prohibit
not
hers
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
was
set
as
guardian
at
its
gates
we
must
also
recall
the
opposition
of
the
church
through
the
ages
to
all
attempts
made
towards
the
amelioration
of
woman
s
suffering
at
time
of
her
bringing
forth
children
upon
the
plea
that
such
mitigation
was
a
direct
interference
with
the
mandate
of
the
almighty
and
an
inexcusable
sin
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
the
chapter
upon
witchcraft
the
bitter
hostility
of
the
church
to
the
use
of
anaesthetics
by
the
women
physicians
of
that
period
was
shown
and
its
opposing
sermons
its
charges
of
heresy
its
burnings
at
the
stake
as
methods
of
enforcing
that
opposition
man
ever
unjust
to
woman
has
been
no
less
so
in
the
field
of
work
he
has
not
taken
upon
himself
the
entire
work
of
the
world
as
commanded
but
has
ever
imposed
a
large
portion
of
it
upon
woman
neither
do
all
men
labor
but
thousands
in
idleness
evade
the
curse
of
work
pronounced
upon
all
men
alike
the
church
in
its
teachings
and
through
its
the
duty
of
man
in
this
respect
is
guilty
of
that
defiance
of
the
lord
god
it
has
ever
been
so
ready
to
attribute
to
woman
the
pulpit
does
not
proclaim
that
this
curse
of
work
rests
upon
any
man
does
not
preach
this
command
to
the
idle
the
profligate
the
rich
or
the
honored
but
on
the
contrary
shows
less
sympathy
and
less
respect
for
the
laborer
than
for
the
idle
man
the
influence
of
this
neglect
of
its
duty
by
the
church
has
permeated
the
christian
world
we
everywhere
find
contempt
for
the
man
who
amid
thorns
and
thistles
tills
the
ground
obeying
his
primal
curse
of
earning
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
everywhere
see
respect
accorded
to
the
man
who
by
whatever
means
of
honest
or
of
dishonest
capacity
evades
his
curse
taking
no
share
in
the
labors
of
the
field
nor
earning
his
bread
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
anaesthetics
have
justly
been
called
the
greatest
boon
ever
conferred
by
science
upon
mankind
but
after
the
persecution
of
the
witchcraft
period
a
knowledge
of
their
use
was
lost
to
the
world
for
many
hundred
years
but
when
rediscovered
during
the
present
century
their
employment
in
mitigating
the
sufferings
of
the
expectant
mother
again
met
with
the
same
opposition
as
during
the
middle
ages
upon
the
same
ground
of
its
interference
with
the
curse
pronounced
by
god
upon
woman
the
question
of
their
use
at
such
time
was
violently
discussed
at
ministerial
gatherings
and
when
sir
james
simpson
physician
to
queen
victoria
employed
them
at
the
birth
of
the
later
princes
and
princesses
he
was
assailed
by
pulpit
and
press
as
having
sacrilegiously
thwarted
the
when
the
practice
was
introduced
into
the
united
states
prominent
new
england
clergymen
preached
against
their
use
upon
the
same
ground
of
its
being
an
impious
frustration
of
the
curse
of
the
almighty
upon
woman
but
the
history
of
christendom
does
not
show
an
instance
in
which
the
church
or
the
pulpit
ever
opposed
labor
by
woman
upon
the
ground
of
its
being
an
interference
with
the
curse
pronounced
upon
man
but
on
the
contrary
her
duty
to
labor
has
been
taught
by
church
and
state
alike
having
met
no
opposition
unless
perchance
she
has
entered
upon
some
remunerative
employment
theretofore
monopolized
by
man
with
the
purpose
of
applying
its
proceeds
to
her
own
individual
use
nor
has
objection
then
arisen
because
of
the
work
but
solely
because
of
its
qualities
an
investigation
of
the
laws
concerning
woman
their
origin
growth
and
by
whom
chiefly
sustained
will
enable
us
to
judge
how
far
they
are
founded
upon
the
eternal
principles
of
justice
and
how
far
emanating
from
ignorance
superstition
and
love
of
power
which
is
the
basis
of
all
despotism
viewing
her
through
the
christian
ages
we
find
woman
has
chiefly
been
regarded
as
an
element
of
wealth
the
labor
of
wife
and
daughters
the
sale
of
the
latter
in
the
prostitution
of
a
loveless
marriage
having
been
an
universally
extended
form
of
domestic
slavery
one
which
the
latest
court
decisions
recognize
as
still
extant
it
is
the
boast
of
america
and
europe
that
woman
holds
a
higher
position
in
the
world
of
work
under
christianity
than
under
pagandom
heathen
treatment
of
women
in
this
respect
often
forms
the
subject
of
returned
missionary
sermons

men
apparently
forgetful
that
servile
labor
of
the
severest
and
most
degrading

introduced

against

in

they

they
have
found

petty
annoyance

in

are

less

a
most
deplorable
evidence
of
the
low
respect
in
which
woman
is
held
and
the
slavery
that
work

mean
for
her
is
the
suggestion
often
made
by
employers
that
she
shall
supplement
her
wages
by
the
sale
of
her

the
manager
of
an
industrial
league
in

york
city
a
few
years
since
found
that
no
young

escaped
such
temptation
neither
extreme
youth
nor

afforded
security
or
protection

were
rather
additional
inducements

let

go
where

at
washington
she
will
find
her
innocence
assailed
if
not
made
the
price
at
which
she

regarding

workers
in
the
foundries
of
pittsburgh
where
five
hundred
women
are
employed
in
putting

on

and

declared
they
received
less
than
the
sum
formerly
paid
to

who
did
the
same
kind
of
work
women
getting
from
but
four
to
five
dollars
a
week
while
the
wages
of
men
ranged
from
fourteen
to
sixteen
dollars
a
week
but
as
evil
as
the
experience
of
young
women
in
the
world
of
work
that
of
old
women
is
in
some
respects
even
greater
while
the
young
girl
is
almost
certain
to
obtain
work
even
if
at
small
wages
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
woman
of
mature
years
to
obtain
work
at
all
either
in
households
as
seamstresses
or
in
manufactories
societies
in
the
city
of

york
for
the
aid
of
the
working
women
find
it
impossible
to
secure
employment
for
women
the
report
of
one
such
society
stated
that
some
of
these
women
managed
to
procure
commitment
to
the
island
in
order
to
obtain
food
and
prevent
absolute
starvation
others
slowly
died
from
want
of
sufficient
food
still
others
like
the
poor
hard
working
girls
of
paris
sought
the
river
as
an
end
to
their
sufferings
as
in
the
witchcraft
period
when
the
chief
persecution
for
many
years
raged
against
old
women
we
still
find
in
our
own
country
that
the
woman
of
middle
life
is
the
least
regarded
in
her
efforts
for
a
livelihood
the
reason
remains
the
same
looked
upon
during
the
christian
ages
from
a
sensual
standard
the
church
teaching
that
woman
was
made
for
man
still
exerts
its
poisonous
influence
still
destroys
woman
not
alone
employers
and
male
laborers
oppress
woman
but
legislation
is
frequently
invoked
to
prevent
her
entering
certain
occupations
the
coal
miner
s
bill
was
one
of
many
instances
in
great
britain
women
work
there
also
at
making
nails
spikes
and
chains
not
long
since
legislation
prohibiting
their
entering
this
branch
of
work
was
attempted
when
a
deputation
of
women
waited
upon
the
home
secretary
to
protest
against
government
interference
with
their
right
to
earn
a
livelihood
one
of
these
representative
women
had
entered
the
work
at
seven
years
of
age
being
then
having
spent
nearly
half
a
century
in
this
occupation
she
was
practically
incapacitated
for
any
other
form
of
labor
the
terrible
condition
of
working
women
in
paris
has
attracted
the
attention
of
the
french
government
in
but
three
or
four
trades
are
they
even
fairly
well
paid
and
these
few
require
a
peculiar
adaptation
as
well
as
an
expensive
training
out
of
reach
of
most
women
laborers
and
even
in
these
best
paid
kinds
of
work
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
man
exists
at
the

upon

sum
it
is
impossible
for

to

many
of
these

die
of
slow
starvation
others
are
driven
into

there

by
the

what
neither

is
the
fact
that
the

christian

the

thrust
upon
her
is
the
chief
cause

a
french
gentleman
employing
a
large
number
of

in

was
appalled
at
the
great
amount
of
infant
mortality
among

the

to
be
in

rochad
who
has
given
much
time
to
this
question
prophesied
that
the
population
of
france
would
become
stationary
before
the
end
of
the
century
at
that
time
his
words
carried
no
weight
he
was
ridiculed
as
a
vague
theorizer
but
this
result
has
been
reached
in
one
half
the
time
he
gave
and
the
results
are
even
of
graver
character
than
rochad
assumed
them
to
be
the
balance
has
already
fallen
upon
the
opposite
side
and
in
a
single
year
the
deaths
have
outnumbered
the
births
nearly
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
infants
annually
die
in
france
because
of
the
impoverished
blood
hard
work
and
general
innutrition
of
french
mothers
these
lives
are
the
more
precious
to
france
which
can
no
longer
afford
to
lose
them
since
in
a
single
year
the
death
rate
outnumbered
the
birth
rate
through
the
effort
of
rochad
a
society
has
been
organized
rules
for
feeding
infants
formulated
with
penalties
attached
and
like
futile
methods
for
effecting
a
change
suggested
while
the
real
cause
of
the
lessening
population
is
left
untouched
until
the
condition
of
the
mother
as
is
held
as
sacred
under
christianity
as
it
was
among
the
greeks
and
romans
until
man
taking
his
own
curse
upon
himself
frees
woman
from
its
penalties
until
she
and
her
young
children
are
supplied
with
nourishing
food
and
woman
secures
pure
air
to
breathe
and
freedom
from
the
hardships
so
supremely
her

under

an

in

women
become
beasts

still
they

not
grumble
they
do
not

simply
exist
the
only
liberty
they
have
is
liberty

the
only

they

the

is
a
perpetual

in

performed

a
few
years

this

with
the
understanding

says
one

the

in

no

live
like
lords
in

while
the

thing
to
see
a
woman
yoked
to
a
plough
with
an
ass
while
her
husband
guides
it
an
alpine
farmer
counts
it
an
act
of
politeness
to
lend
his
wife
to
a
neighbor
who
has
too
much
work
and
the
neighbor
in
return
lends
his

unless
he

employers
prefer

of
their
lower

and
greater
docility
for
twelve

a

receives

thirty
cents
even
in
little
montenegro
husbands
lend
their

to
each
other
during
the
harvest
season
and
an
exceptionally

time
and
strength
thrown
upon
women
of
the
christian
household
are
labors
more
severe
than
fell
on
the
savage
woman
of
america
during
her
whole
life
until
the
customs
of
civilization
reached
the
indians
their
wives
according
to
catlin
schoolcraft
and
others
were
not
called
upon
to
work
with
half
the
severity
of
the
women
of
today
nor
had
they
tradition
of
children
ever
born
deaf
dumb
or
blind
those
kinds
of
labor
pointed
to
as
showing
the
hardships
of
an
indian
woman
s
life
schoolcraft
dismisses
very
lightly
the
lodge
built
by
her
is
not
made
of
heavy
posts
and
carpentry
but
of
thin
poles
bent
over
at
the
top
such
as
a
child
can
lift
when
a
family
changed
its
residence
these
poles
were
not
removed
only
the
thin
sheets
of
birch
bark
covering
were
taken

with

the
tillage
of

alike
by

were

a
puzzle

in

those

or

she
says
in
all
these
months
among
the

every
day
i
never
saw
a
child
struck
and
i
heard
a
child
cry
but
twice
while
on
the
dark
continent
how
different
from
the
countries
of
christian
civilization
where
children
mere
infants
of
three
and
four
years
are
put
to
the
most
severe
labor
or
because
of
the
mother
s
enslaved
condition
die
from
neglect
it
will
be
said
but
these
instances
especially
in
the
united
states
are
exceptional
this
is
not
so
although
the
work
performed
may
be
of
a
different
character
the
wife
even
in
this
country
is
expected
to
understand
and
perform
many
kinds
of
labor
she
is
cook
and
baker
laundress
and
seamstress
nurse
for
her
children
and
the
sick
besides
a
thousand
and
one
cares
which
rise
before
her
every
hour
one
such
overworked
mother
acknowledged
to
placing
the
cradle
where
the
sun
would
shine
in
the
baby
s
eyes
thus
compelling
them
to
close
when
she
would
push
all
out
of
the
way
underneath
the
bed
said
a
german
girl
working
as
help
in
the
modern
kitchen
of
a
american
family
i
plowed
at
home
harnessed
beside
a
cow
and
the
work
was
not
as
hard
as
in
your
hot
the
care
of
children
and
domestic
labor
are
not
compatible
with
each
other
one
must
be
neglected
and
she
of
whom
meals
on
time
are
demanded
can
say
where
the
neglect
necessarily
falls
a
consistent
carrying
out
by
man
of
his
curse
would
cause
him
to
take
upon
himself
the
entire
work
of
the
world
not
alone
tilling
the
soil
but
all
household
labor
the
baking
and
brewing
the
cooking
and
cleaning
and
all
the
multitudinous
forms
of
work
which
make
such
wearisomely
incessant
demands
upon
woman
s
strength
and
time
from
all
sewing
knitting
crocheting
embroidering
she
should
be
freed
and
even
beyond
this
under
the
principles
of
curse
upon
man
should
fall
all
the
work
of
rearing
children
as
woman
s
curse
so
often
quoted
does
not
refer
to
aught
but
bringing
them
to
life
in
sorrow
and
suffering
custom
which
has
been
defined
as
unwritten
law
adds
its
force
to
legislative
enactments
and
soon
becomes
as
binding
upon
thought
as
a
moral
command
people
soon
cease
to
question
a
custom
or
a
law
accepting
both
in
that
conservative
spirit
so
utterly
destructive
to
liberty
for
that
reason
what
has
long
been
so
is
regarded
as
right
and
even
while
regretting
the
neglect
of
her
children
so
unavoidable
to
the
ordinarily
situated
mothers
few
women
give
thought
to
the
cause
bringing
it
about
women
are
not
sufficiently
permeated
with
the
meaning
of
personal
liberty
they
do
not
sufficiently
investigate
the
causes
of
their
restricted
condition
and
the
break
made
within
the
past
to
forty
years
against
conditions
has
rather
been
in
the
nature
of
a
blind
instinctive
revolt
than
brought
about
through
philosophic
thought
except
in
the
minds
of
a
few
who
by
the
protest
of
speech
opened
the
way
that
vast
multitudes
are
now
entering
upon
open
rebellion
against
law
is
ever
considered
by
the
majority
as
rebellion
against
morality
speaking
of
the
moral
influence
of
law
sheldon
amos
says
as
soon
as
a
law
is
made
and
lifted
out
of
the
region
of
controversy
it
begins
to
exercise
a
moral
influence
which
is
no
less
intense
and
for
being
almost
imperceptible
though
law
can
never
attempt
to
forbid
all
that
is
morally
wrong
yet
that
gets
to
be
held
as
morally
wrong
which
the
law
forbids
no
less
does
unwritten
law
come
to
be
regarded
as
morally
right
the
customs
of
society
build
up
through
teachings
of
the
church
and
laws
of
the
state
have
destroyed
that
sense
of
personal
security
among
women
which
is
the
chief
value
of
social
life
and
of
law
the
very
foundation
of
religion
tends
to
this
end
even
with
man
but
the
division
of
rights
and
duties
promulgated
by
the
church
as
between
man
and
woman
the
changing
form
of
rendered
the
position
of
woman
notably
insecure
this
usurpation
is
productive
of
immense
loss
to
the
state
as
france
so
clearly
shows
take
the
one
article
of
food
alone
the
delicacies
and
the
substantials
alike
are
claimed
by
man
no
proof
of
this
statement
other
than
the
innumerable
saloons
and
restaurants
chiefly
supported
by
men
is
required
while
the
dairyman
the
the
horse
trainer
and
even
the
pugilist
recognize
the
value
of
food
as
far
as
a
factor
of
life
and
strength
where
his
own
immediate
money
interest
is
concerned
neither
governments
religions
nor
scientists
have
to
any
extent
noted
the
influence
of
proper
food
for
the
mother
upon
the
health
and
life
of
the
unborn
child
victor
hugo
while
upon
the
island
of
guernsey
noted
the
vastly
beneficial
effect
that
even
one
good
meal
a
week
had
upon
the
peasant
children
food
building
muscles
nerves
the
brain
what
can
be
expected
but
a
deterioration
of
humanity
when
mothers
eat
insufficient
or
improper
food
the
effect
of
the
kind
of
food
eaten
has
recently
been
noted
in
the
new
industry
of
ostrich
farming
in
california
of
which
it
is
said
ostriches
yield
the
best
feathers
if
the
birds
are
well
cared
for
the
quality
of
the
plumes
depends
upon
the
quality
of
the
food
if
the
ostriches
are
well
fed
their
plumes
are
soft
and
big
bad
feeding
makes
the
feathers
hard
and
nor
are
animals
from
whom
the
best
products
are
looked
for
allowed
to
labor
their
lives
are
those
of
ease
and
comfort
that
best
results
may
be
obtained
innutrition
and
the
hard
labor
of
expectant
mothers
are
the
two
great
factors
in
physical
degeneration
and
infantile
mortality
the
question
is
not
one
of
sentiment
or
of
law
or
of
religion
but
of
physiology
it
does
not
alone
involve
the
destiny
of
mothers
but
of
the
race
there
is
not
a
national
problem
be
it
of
war
or
population
or
finance
that
is
not
based
upon
the
condition
of
woman
its
neglect
has
depopulated
the
world
in
times
past
it
has
lessened
intellectual
development
it
has
almost
entirely
obliterated
certain
kinds
of
morality
and
can
no
longer
be
regarded
from
the
standard
of
either
of
those
great
institutions
church
or
state
the
recent
official
report
of
the
factory
inspector
of
the
state
of
new
york
upon
the
condition
of
working
women
showed
a
condition
quite
in
line
with
the
worst
features
of
foreign
lands
overwork
bad
ventilation
low
wages
poor
food
all
combining
for
their
physical
and
moral
destruction
under
heading
of
in
darkest
new
york
speaks
of
the
condition
of
the
poor
in
that
city
both
men
and
women
but
while
not
forgetting
the
wrongs
of
the
male
laborer
we
must
ever
remember
that
the
condition
of
woman
is
still
lower
and
the
results
of
her
severe
work
and
much
more
injurious
to
the
world
we
must
leave
the
tenements
without
attempting
to
reproduce
any
of
the
shocking
cases
of
crowded
rooms
in
which
almost
incredible
numbers
of
poor
wretches
are
huddled
together
even
in
summer
when
riis
has
found
the
thermometer
rise
to
degrees
in
some
of
these
places
there
is
more
than
struggle
there
is
often
starvation
every
once
in
a
while
a
case
of
downright
starvation
gets
into
the
papers
and
makes
a
sensation
but
this
is
the
exception
were
the
whole
truth
known
it
would
come
home
to
the
community
with
a
shock
that
would
arouse
it
to
a
more
serious
effort
than
the
spasmodic
undoing
of
its
pursestrings
i
am
satisfied
that
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
are
every
day
slowly
starving
to
death
with
my
medical
friend
s
complaint
of
improper
within
a
single
week
i
have
had
this
year
three
cases
of
insanity
provoked
directly
by
poverty
and
want
worse
than
even
that
is
the
evil
case
of
thousands
of
working
girls
the
average
wages
of
of
them
is
cents
per
day
and
that
includes
the
incomes
of
the
stylish
cashiers
who
earn
a
day
as
well
as
the
pittance
of
girls
who
earn
cents
a
day
in
factories
the
lot
of
the
average
saleswoman
who
does
not
partly
depend
on
her
family
is
hard
indeed
that
the
average
wages
of
the
working
girls
in
the
city
of
new
york
alone
are
but
sixty
cents
a
day
some
receiving
as
little
as
thirty
cents
in
the
east
side
factories
that
young
girls
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
fourteen
employed
as
cash
girls
can
not
supply
themselves
with
food
unless
having
parents
upon
whom
to
partially
depend
are
no
less
moral
than
material
questions
nor
are
they
questions
confined
to
that
one
city
or
to
any
one
portion
of
the
united
states
or
of
christendom
but
belong
to
humanity
itself
as
all
are
parts
of
one
great
whole
the
evil
that
afflicts
one
class
touches
all
all
suffer
because
of
the
wrong
done
to
even
one
human
being
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
york
is
more
largely
comprised
of
women
than
of
men
and
a
great
proportion
of
this
class
are
dependent
upon
their
own
labor
for
a
livelihood
although
many
women
emigrate
to
this
country
over
two
millions
having
landed
upon
our
shores
within
the
nine
years
from
to
it
is
not
alone
upon
them
these
conditions
of
severe
labor
fall
but
american
women
both
within
and
without
the
household
suffer
from
the
same
kind
of
oppression
even
upon
the
pacific
coast
where
few
foreigners
except
chinese
are
found
little
girls
of
five
and
six
years
are
put
to
work
in
the
jute
mills
and
factories
by
side
of
their
drudging
mothers
whose
wages
do
not
equal
those
of
the
men
employed
in
government
clerkships
at
washington
women
receive
but
the
pay
that
men
receive
for
the
same
kind
and
quality
of
work
although
the
sweating
system
in
the
manufactories
of
clothing
has
called
the
nation
s
attention
to
its
abuses
yet
in
the
district
of
columbia
under
sole
power
of
congress
a
system
of
similar
nature
exists
nor
are
statistics
of
woman
s
severe
work
in
the
united
states
of
immediately
recent
date
the
labor
commission
report
of
the
state
of
connecticut
for
declaring
that
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
farmer
engage
in
work
which
he
can
find
no
man
to
do
rising
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
working
until
nine
in
the
evening
analyzing
the
statistics
of
the
massachusetts
labor
bureau
for
the
showed
the
greatly
inferior
payment
of
women
laborers
the
figures
simply
show
that
in
the
employments
in
which
the
very
lowest
wages
are
paid
women
constitute
over
per
cent
of
the
workers
while
in
the
employments
where
as
high
as
a
week
are
paid
they
constitute
hardly
over
per
cent
in
addition
to
all
this
is
the
humiliating
fact
that
in
some
occupations
standing
side
by
side
with
men
the
females
are
paid
less
wages
for
the
same
work
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
a
woman
of
years
or
upwards
is
made
to
work
side
by
side
with
a
boy
often
at
the
same
wages
women
are
compelled
then
to
fill
most
of
the
cheap
places
and
paid
less
wages
for
the
same
work
at
that
in
this
report
the
shameful
fact
is
proven
through
governmental
statistics
that
the
wages
paid
to
a
girl
of
twenty
years
are
no
more
than
those
paid
a
boy
of
ten
women
constituting
over
seventy
per
cent
of
the
workers
to
whom
the
very
lowest
wages
are
paid
underlying
all
other
results
are
those
upon
woman
herself
before
every
question
of
population
is
that
of
woman
as
an
individual
overwork
and
the
under
nourishment
of
muscle
nerve
brain
render
her
own
proper
evolution
either
as
a
physical
or
as
a
moral
being
impossible
to
just
the
extent
that
such
pressure
comes
upon
her
does
she
cease
to
be
a
morally
responsible
being
thousands
to
whom
life
and
comforts
are
sweet
throw
aside
all
scruples
entering
that
one
avenue
of
escape
always
open
to
a
young
woman
or
a
girl
for
the
statement
that
the
majority
of
women
entering
upon
immorality
have
been
driven
by
actual
want
to
this
mode
of
life
we
are
again
indebted
to
rigorous
investigation
and
statistics
for
information
but
the
moral
deterioration
of
the
race
arising
from
these
wrongs
to
women
can
not
be
estimated
by
figures
in
teaching
the
only
absolute
equality
of
wages
between
man
and
woman
is
found
in
the
cherokee
nation
of
indians
the
civilization
of
the
indian
tribes
is
a
question
of
woman
s
education
and
freedom
the
world
still
holds
a
mistaken
idea
of
force
and
power
those
questions
not
so
fully
pertaining
to
the
physical
as
to
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
parts
of
the
being
the
york
recently
said
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
preservation
of
the
dignity
and
independence
of
women
that
they
should
be
on
a
par
with
men
as
regards
property
and
education
the
two
things
that
in
modern
times
have
supplanted
physical
force
as
elements
of
real
estate
possesses
more
power
as
property
than
either
money
or
jewels
the
real
strength
of
american
civilization
lies
in
the
fact
that
almost
every
family
owns
its
home
permanent
national
strength
lies
in
the
division
of
realty
in
england
women
are
more
rapidly
becoming
part
of
the
governing
class
than
in
the
united
states
and
in
that
country
of
the
landed
property
owners
are
women
these
facts
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
regard
to
the
civilization
of
the
native
races
of
america
it
is
through
the
indian
women
that
the
problem
of
their
civilization
must
be
answered
the
title
in
fee
simple
to
lands
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
women
the
union
of
the
state
with
the
church
in
the
enforcement
of
man
s
curse
upon
woman
is
most
forcibly
shown
by
a
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
rendered
early
in
which
held
that
the
services
of
a
wife
belong
to
the
husband
and
that
she
can
not
recover
wages
from
him
even
if
holding
his
written
promise
to
pay
this
decision
like
that
of
the
case
in
england
was
upon
the
principle
that
the
wife
is
so
fully
under
subjection
to
her
husband
as
to
incapacitate
her
from
making
a
contract
even
with
that
husband
in
all
the
wife
s
relations
to
the
husband
she
is
regarded
as
a
being
without
responsibility
the
case
upon
which
this
decision
rested
is
this
a
woman
fell
down
a
and
sued
for
damages
recovering
the
defendant
asked
for
a
new
trial
upon
the
ground
that
the
woman
was
working
for
her
husband
and
the
court
had
taken
into
account
her
loss
of
wages
the
services
of
the
wife
belonging
to
the
husband
her
claim
for
lost
wages
was
a
fraud
but
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
doubtless
will
not
interfere
with
the
power
of
the
husband
to
recover
damages
for
loss
of
her
time
by
reason
of
this
injury
which
deprived
him
of
her
services
the
decision
of
the
court
recognized
the
right
of
the
husband
to
compel
the
wife
to
perform
household
duties
for
him
when
in
england
the
married
woman
s
property
rights
bill
was
before
parliament
a
commission
of
inquiry
was
sent
to
new
york
to
learn
the
effect
of
securing
the
control
of
their
own
property
to
married
women
under
various
amendments
since
the
first
passage
of
this
act
in
the
legislature
of
new
york
has
farther
secured
to
married
women
the
right
of
making
wills
of
collecting
wages
for
work
and
of
entering
business
outside
of
the
household
the
proceeds
belonging
entirely
to
herself
but
under
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
ground
was
taken
that
the
wife
can
not
collect
wages
from
the
husband
and
that
household
work
for
him
is
compulsory
upon
her
this
decision
as
to
compulsory
housework
controverts
that
other
right
recognized
by
legislation
of
entering
into
business
doing
work
outside
of
the
home
the
proceeds
to
belong
solely
to
herself
under
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
a
wife
can
be
compelled
to
work
for
the
husband
in
the
house
without
wages
and
is
debarred
from
all
outside
business
augustine
in
his
city
of
god
taunts
rome
with
having
caused
her
own
downfall
by
her
treatment
of
her
slaves
he
speaks
of
the
slaves
as
miserable
beings
put
to
labor
only
fit
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
even
degraded
below
them
their
condition
had
brought
rome
to
its
own
destruction
but
roman
wives
were
not
forced
to
labor
the
peace
made
by
the
sabines
with
the
romans
after
the
forcible
abduction
of
the
sabine
maidens
had
for
one
of
its
provisions
that
no
labor
except
spinning
should
be
required
from
wives
among
both
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
the
woman
about
to
become
a
mother
as
heretofore
shown
was
held
sacred
she
was
exempt
from
hard
labor
and
no
one
was
allowed
under
penalty
of
punishment
to
vex
or
disturb
her
mind
if
degrading
their
slaves
below
the
beasts
of
the
field
led
to
the
destruction
of
rome
as
declared
by
augustine
what
may
not
be
predicted
of
that
christian
civilization
which
in
the
twentieth
century
of
its
existence
degrades
women
and
children
to
such
labors
as
he
declared
unfit
for
the
slaves
of
ancient
rome
suitable
only
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
which
harnesses
them
by
side
of
cows
asses
and
dogs
to
do
the
most
menial
work
which
robs
them
in
wages
and
stints
them
in
food
in
the
name
of
religion
church
of
while
under
advancing
civilization
a
recognition
of
the
religious
rights
of
woman
is
steadily
progressing
among
people
at
large
it
requires
but
slight
investigation
to
prove
that
olden
church
theories
regarding
her
not
only
came
into
the
reformation
but
largely
remain
the
same
today
the
christianity
of
the
ages
having
taught
the
existence
of
a
superior
and
an
inferior
sex
possessing
different
rights
in
the
christian
church
held
accountable
to
different
codes
of
morals
it
is
not
strange
that
we
do
not
find
morality
to
have
been
more
of
a
fundamental
principle
among
the
pastors
of
early
protestant
churches
than
in
the
catholic
priesthood
the
doctrine
of
once
in
grace
always
in
grace
carries
with
it
a
plea
for
vice
and
the
early
experience
of
strict
calvinistic
scotland
was
much
that
of
mediaeval
catholic
europe
the
presbyterian
conventicles
early
bore
an
extremely
evil
reputation
the
fact
that
ministers
of
the
reformed
church
were
permitted
marriage
did
not
change
priestly
teaching
that
woman
was
created
solely
for
man
and
they
found
apologies
in
the
bible
for
illicit
conduct
these
protestant
clergymen
taught
as
had
the
catholic
that
a
priest
was
incapable
of
sinning
and
from
the
sermon
on
the
mount
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
was
quoted
in
proof
of
this
assertion
even
when
under
circumstances
of
great
personal
peril
and
danger
to
life
the
trust
of
parishioners
in
the
morality
of
their
shepherds
was
often
abused
of
this
rev
david
williamson
one
of
the
most
eminent
presbyterian
ministers
of
edinburgh
was
a
conspicuous
example
in
defense
of
his
immorality
williamson
said
verily
i
do
not
deny
that
with
paul
i
have
a
law
in
my
members
warring
against
the
law
of
my
mind
and
bringing
me
into
captivity
unto
the
love
of
sin
which
is
in
my
the
strangest
sermons
most
insulting
to
woman
and
too
indecorous
for
quotation
were
constantly
preached
while
her
inferiority
and
incapacity
for
understanding
even
the
gospel
was
also
as
constantly
declared
from
the
pulpit
an
old
presbyterian
preacher
rev
david
douglas
discovering
a
woman
weeping
in
the
kirk
pointed
toward
her
crying
wife
what
makes
you
weep
i
am
sure
thou
understandeth
not
what
i
am
saying
my
discourse
is
directed
to
the
brethren
and
not
to
the
like
of
the
present
century
with
all
its
enlightenment
does
not
cease
to
give
us
glimpses
of
that
favorite
mediaeval
doctrine
that
sin
can
be
killed
with
sin
as
the
best
way
of
becoming
innocent
again
and
its
concomitant
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
person
in
grace
to
commit
sin
the
doctrines
of
holiness
and
entire
sanctification
taught
by
some
sects
today
and
the
theory
that
all
experience
is
necessary
in
order
to
a
full
development
of
character
are
of
the
same
nature
eastern
wisdom
religion
declares
that
a
person
can
become
neither
god
nor
deva
without
passing
through
all
experience
returning
again
and
again
to
earth
for
this
purpose
the
departure
of
the
from
the
bosom
of
the
divinity
is
a
radiation
from
the
life
of
the
great
all
who
expends
his
strength
in
order
that
he
may
grow
again
and
live
by
its
return
god
thereby
acquires
new
vital
force
provided
by
all
the
transformation
that
the
has
undergone
its
return
is
its
final
reward
such
is
the
secret
of
the
evolution
of
the
great
being
and
of
the
supreme
soul
directions
for
seeking
out
the
way
seek
it
not
by
any
one
road
to
each
temperament
there
is
one
road
which
seems
the
most
desirable
but
the
way
is
not
found
by
devotion
alone
by
religious
contemplation
alone
by
ardent
progress
by
labor
by
studious
observation
of
life
none
can
take
the
disciple
more
than
one
step
onward
all
steps
are
necessary
to
make
up
the
ladder
one
by
one
as
they
are
surmounted
the
virtues
of
men
are
steps
indeed
by
any
means
to
be
dispensed
with
yet
though
they
create
a
fine
atmosphere
and
happy
future
they
are
useless
if
they
stand
alone
the
whole
nature
of
man
must
be
used
wisely
by
the
one
who
desires
to
enter
the
way
each
man
is
to
himself
absolutely
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
seek
it
by
plunging
into
the
mysterious
and
glorious
depths
of
your
own
inmost
being
seek
it
by
testing
all
experience
by
utilizing
the
senses
in
order
to
understand
the
growth
and
meaning
of
individuality
and
the
beauty
and
obscurity
of
those
other
divine
fragments
which
are
struggling
side
by
side
with
you
and
form
the
race
to
which
you
belong
the
catholic
and
calvinistic
doctrines
of
woman
s
inferiority
of
position
and
intellect
taught
from
the
pulpit
are
by
no
means
relegated
to
past
centuries
but
continue
to
be
publicly
taught
by
the
protestant
clergy
of
every
sect
as
fully
as
by
their
catholic
and
greek
brethren
the
first
national
woman
suffrage
convention
which
assembled
in
washington
having
invited
rev
chaplain
gray
of
the
house
to
open
its
proceedings
with
prayer
he
referred
in
this
petition
to
woman
as
an
of
the
creator
an
inferior
and
secondary
being
called
into
existence
for
the
special
benefit
of
man
the
noble
old
quakeress
lucretia
mott
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
devout
attention
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
at
close
of
the
prayer
bible
in
hand
she
read
aloud
the
account
of
the
creation
genesis
i
woman
and
man
equals
both
having
been
given
dominion
over
nature
the
thirtieth
anniversary
of
the
first
public
demand
of
woman
for
the
recognition
of
her
equality
of
right
with
man
held
in
rochester
july
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
asserting
woman
s
equality
and
religious
rights
with
man
three
of
these
proved
especially
obnoxious
to
the
clergy
of
the
country
in
declaring
the
first
duty
of
every
individual
to
be
self
development
the
duty
of
every
woman
to
be
guided
by
her
own
reason
rather
than
the
authority
of
another
and
that
it
was
owing
to
the
perversion
of
the
religious
element
in
woman
that
she
had
been
so
completely
subjugated
to
priestcraft
and
superstition
that
as
the
first
duty
of
every
individual
is
the
lessons
of
and
obedience
taught
to
woman
by
the
christian
church
have
been
fatal
not
only
to
her
own
vital
interests
but
through
her
to
those
of
the
race
that
the
great
principle
of
the
protestant
reformation
the
right
of
individual
conscience
and
judgment
heretofore
exercised
by
men
alone
should
now
be
claimed
by
woman
that
in
the
interpretation
of
scripture
she
should
be
guided
by
her
own
reason
and
not
by
the
authority
of
the
church
that
it
is
through
the
perversion
of
the
religious
element
in
upon
her
hopes
and
fears
of
the
future
holding
this
life
with
all
its
high
duties
in
abeyance
to
that
which
is
to
she
and
the
children
she
has
borne
have
been
wrongfully
subjugated
by
priestcraft
and
superstition
these
resolutions
immediately
called
forth
a
sermon
in
opposition
from
the
rev
strong
president
of
the
rochester
theological
seminary
baptist
in
which
he
said
she
is
subordinate
to
man
in
office
she
is
to
be
helper
not
principal
therefore
man
has
precedence
in
the
order
of
creation
woman
is
made
of
man
and
to
supply
the
felt
need
of
man
the
race
therefore
is
called
the
race
of
man
and
not
the
race
of
woman
for
this
office
of
subordination
and
whether
they
assert
it
or
not
women
are
fitted
by
their
very
constitution
and
in
the
very
creation
of
mankind
in
the
garden
of
beauty
undefiled
by
the
slimy
track
of
the
serpent
as
it
was
god
ordained
the
subordination
of
woman
and
the
differences
of
nature
that
makes
her
subordination
inevitable
the
power
of
rule
seems
to
me
to
have
been
invested
in
the
head
of
the
family
that
he
may
act
for
them
or
rather
that
they
may
act
through
him
the
assertion
of
this
theologian
that
the
race
therefore
is
called
the
race
of
man
and
not
the
race
of
woman
is
of
the
same
character
as
that
of
inquisitor
sprenger
in
regard
to
the
word
as
applied
to
woman
showing
the
intellectual
calibre
of
both
inquisitor
and
theologian
to
be
the
same
but
in
their
assertion
of
woman
s
inferiority
and
subordination
neither
chaplain
gray
nor
president
strong
proceeded
quite
as
far
as
an
opposing
speaker
at
the
philadelphia
woman
suffrage
convention
of
who
said
let
woman
first
prove
that
she
has
a
soul
both
the
bible
and
the
church
deny
here
we
are
set
back
to
the
macon
council
of
the
sixth
century
which
debated
the
question
of
woman
s
humanity
that
the
church
of
the
nineteenth
century
possesses
the
same
character
as
that
of
the
fourteenth
the
twelfth
and
fifth
was
forcibly
illustrated
during
the
early
days
of
the
struggle
especially
in
its
persecution
of
the
women
who
took
part
in
that
reform
lucretia
mott
and
esther
moore
were
integral
members
of
the
american
society
having
assisted
in
the
convention
which
organized
this
society
in
shortly
afterward
the
grimke
sisters
of
south
carolina
sarah
and
angelina
convinced
of
the
sinfulness
of
slavery
left
their
delightful
home
in
charleston
and
coming
north
spoke
eloquently
through
massachusetts
against
those
wrongs
of
which
they
themselves
had
been
witnesses
the
church
becoming
frightened
at
woman
s
increasing
power
and
influence
determined
to
crush
her
work
its
action
began
with
the
orthodox
congregational
at
that
time
the
largest
and
most
influential
ecclesiastical
body
of
massachusetts
and
in
the
general
association
of
massachusetts
issued
a
pastoral
letter
calling
upon
all
churches
under
their
care
to
defend
themselves
by
closing
their
doors
against
the
abolitionists
who
had
set
aside
the
laws
of
god
by
welcoming
women
to
their
platforms
and
allowing
them
to
speak
in
public
section
third
was
the
most
significant
portion
of
this
pastoral
letter
iii
we
invite
your
attention
to
the
dangers
which
at
present
seem
to
threaten
the
female
character
with
wide
spread
and
permanent
injury
the
appropriate
duties
and
influence
of
woman
are
clearly
stated
in
the
new
testament
those
duties
and
that
influence
are
unobtrusive
and
private
but
the
source
of
mighty
power
when
the
mild
dependent
softening
influence
of
woman
under
the
sternness
of
man
s
opinions
is
fully
exercised
society
feels
the
effects
of
it
in
a
thousand
forms
the
power
of
woman
is
her
dependence
flowing
from
the
consciousness
of
that
weakness
which
god
has
given
her
for
her
protection
and
which
keeps
her
in
those
departments
of
life
that
form
the
character
of
individuals
and
of
the
nation
there
are
social
influences
which
females
use
in
promoting
piety
and
the
great
objects
of
christian
benevolence
which
we
can
not
too
highly
commend
we
appreciate
the
unostentatious
prayers
and
efforts
of
woman
in
advancing
the
cause
of
religion
at
home
and
abroad
in
sabbath
schools
in
leading
religious
inquirers
to
the
pastors
for
instruction
and
in
all
such
associated
effort
as
becomes
the
modesty
of
her
sex
and
earnestly
hope
that
she
may
abound
more
and
more
in
these
labors
of
piety
and
love
but
when
she
assumes
the
place
and
tone
of
man
as
a
public
reformer
our
care
and
protection
of
her
seem
unnecessary
we
put
ourselves
in
against
her
she
yields
the
power
which
god
has
given
her
for
her
protection
and
her
character
becomes
unnatural
if
the
vine
whose
strength
and
beauty
is
to
lean
upon
the
trellis
work
and
half
conceal
its
clusters
thinks
to
assume
the
independence
and
the
overshadowing
nature
of
the
elm
it
will
not
only
cease
to
bear
fruit
but
fall
in
shame
and
dishonor
into
the
dust
we
can
not
therefore
but
regret
the
mistaken
conduct
of
those
who
encourage
females
to
bear
an
obtrusive
and
ostentatious
part
in
measures
of
reform
and
countenance
any
of
that
sex
who
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
itinerate
in
the
character
of
public
lecturers
and
teachers
we
especially
deplore
the
intimate
acquaintance
and
promiscuous
conversation
of
females
with
regard
to
things
which
ought
not
to
be
named
by
which
that
modesty
and
delicacy
which
is
the
charm
of
domestic
life
and
which
constitutes
the
true
influence
of
woman
in
society
is
consumed
and
the
way
opened
as
we
apprehend
for
degeneracy
and
ruin
we
say
these
things
not
to
discourage
proper
influences
against
sin
but
to
secure
such
reformation
as
we
believe
is
scriptural
and
will
be
permanent
that
we
may
rightly
judge
the
character
of
this
pastoral
letter
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
discussion
upon
what
is
known
as
the
woman
question
took
place
at
those
meetings
which
were
entirely
devoted
to
the
southern
slave
this
letter
was
written
by
men
emanating
from
a
body
of
christian
people
that
sustained
colored
slavery
as
an
institution
upon
which
god
had
as
equally
placed
his
sanction
as
upon
the
subordination
of
woman
to
such
extent
have
the
conscience
and
will
been
under
the
bondage
of
the
priesthood
that
the
more
timid
members
of
the
society
became
frightened
even
some
of
those
who
believed
in
woman
s
equality
advising
these
speakers
to
yield
their
rights
in
the
meetings
lest
the
ministers
who
had
joined
them
should
withdraw
taking
others
with
them
thus
priestly
intolerance
and
the
timidity
of
men
had
the
effect
of
silencing
the
philanthropic
and
eloquent
grimke
sisters
in
their
efforts
for
the
freedom
of
the
slave
after
ten
months
work
their
voices
were
heard
no
more
these
sisters
were
not
only
persecuted
in
the
north
under
ban
of
the
church
but
in
the
south
the
state
united
with
the
church
and
by
a
decree
of
the
city
of
charleston
they
were
rendered
permanent
exiles
from
home
and
informed
that
should
they
return
despite
this
they
would
not
be
able
to
escape
personal
violence
from
a
mob
with
one
noble
exception
this
mandate
of
the
church
and
clergy
had
effect
for
a
time
in
silencing
woman
s
plea
for
the
slave
for
seven
long
years
the
voice
of
but
one
woman
that
of
abby
kelly
was
heard
upon
the
platform
and
the
persecutions
of
the
church
made
her
life
one
long
martyrdom
her
appeals
for
the
slave
were
met
by
mob
violence
furious
howls
cries
and
the
vilest
language
being
supplemented
by
more
material
efforts
for
silencing
her
voice
were
these
proceedings
not
so
thoroughly
substantiated
the
time
so
shortly
past
credence
could
not
be
given
as
to
the
means
used
against
this
noble
woman
to
prevent
her
pleading
for
those
so
greatly
wronged
ministers
of
high
standing
assailed
her
from
the
pulpit
a
favorite
text

revelations
i
have
a
few
things
against
thee
because
thou
suffereth
that
woman

which
calleth
herself
a
prophetess
to
teach
and
seduce
my
servants
to
commit
not
alone
the
congregational
body
but
all
christian
sects
were
imbued
with
the
same
persecuting
spirit
a
methodist
presiding
elder
characterizing
the
garrisonian
societies
as
no
longer
but
woman
s
rights
that
woman
had
assumed
the
right
to
speak
in
public
for
the
oppressed
was
the
origin
of
all
this
vituperation
its
real
cause
was
of
the
same
nature
as
that
which
laid
heads
low
at
bartholomew
that
woman
s
voice
had
been
heard
in
public
contrary
to
the
teaching
of
the
church
it
was
perhaps
foreseen
that
she
might

a
later
period

of
the

was
disturbed
by
the
hostility
of
several

a
few
bigoted

even
to

agreeing
with
minister
douglas
that
they
were
incapable
of
understanding
a
discourse
directed
to
the
brethren
who
alone
were
allowed
to
shout

and
by
a
strange
inconsistency
women
were
still
allowed
to

this

declared

as
to

in

as

her

the

which
govern
her
in
this
wise
we
can
say
frankly
to
our
temperance
brethren
that
if
they
attempt
to
lash
the
wise
project
of
prohibition
of
saloons
and
the
foolish
project
of

inseparably
together
they
will
encounter
fatal
opposition

will
repel

than
they

doctrines
of
woman
suffrage
as
i
am
of
our
presbyterian
ministers
will
never
cast
a
vote
which
is
nominally
only
for
prohibition
and
yet
is
really
a
vote
for
burdening
womanhood
with
civil
government
what
is
true
of
our
church
is
true
of
the
episcopal
reformed
baptist
congregationalist
and
the
most
influential
portion
of
the
methodist
church
the
same
year
of
president

the
united
presbyterian
assembly
passed
a
resolution
to
the
effect
that
they
found
no
sufficient
authority
in
scripture
to
warrant
the
ordination
of
women
as
deacons
yet
they
might
with
profit
to
themselves
and
great
advantage
to
the
cause
of
suffering
humanity
and
for
christ
be
to
act
as
assistants
to
thus
emphasizing
the
dominant
church
teaching
of
woman
s
irresponsibility
and
secondary
position
to
man
the
same
year
however
an
advance
step
was
taken
in
europe
the
synod
of
born
old
catholic
following
the
example
of
pere
hyacinth
adopted
a
resolution
in
favor
of
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
by
a
vote
of
to
at
the
same
time
the
old
catholics
were
taking
this
advance
step
the
protestant
episcopal
diocesan
convention
of
south
carolina
forbade
woman
s
voting
upon
church
matters
although
it
was
proven
during
the
discussion
that
in
some
parishes
that
were
but
five
male
members
the
southern
baptist
convention
held
in
savannah
georgia
appointed
a
committee
with
title
of

whose
business
was
to
decide
upon
representation
by
women
in
church
affairs
this
committee
reported
in
favor
of
the
word
brethren
instead
of
members
being
incorporated
in
the
constitution
thus
confirming
the
right
of
man
alone
to
take
part
in
church
councils
having
thus
effectively
closed
the
lips
of
women
on
discussion
of
church
questions
the
convention
introduced
a
resolution
on
divorce
followed
by
a
speech
declaring
that
but
one
cause
could
exist
the
convention
having
shut
off
all
chance
for
woman
s
opinion
upon
this
question
of

and
even
of

vital

to

these

all
subordinating

in

all
designed
to
repress
woman
s
growing
tendency
towards
freedom
and
her
claim
for
the
same
opportunities
in
life
conceded
to
man
that
the
clerical
teaching
of
woman
s
subordination
to
man
was
not
alone
a
doctrine
of
the
dark
ages
is
proven
by
the
most
abundant
testimony
of
today
the
famous
see
trial
of
which
shook
not
only
the
presbytery
of
newark
but
the
whole
synod
of
new
jersey
and
finally
the
general
presbyterian
assembly
of
the
united
states
was
based
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
divinely
appointed
subordination
of
woman
to
man
and
arose
simply
because
rev
isaac
see
admitted
two
ladies
to
his
pulpit
to
speak
upon
temperance
rev
craven
the
prosecutor
declared
this
act
to
have
been
an
indecency
in
the
sight
of
he
expressed
the
general
clinical
and
church
view
when
he
said
i
believe
the
subject
involves
the
honor
of
my
god
i
believe
the
subject
involves
the
headship
and
crown
of
jesus
woman
was
made
for
man
and
became
first
in
the
transgression
my
argument
is
that
subordination
is
natural
the
subordination
of
sex
see
has
admitted
marital
subordination
but
this
is
not
enough
there
exists
a
created
subordination
a
divinely
arranged
and
appointed
subordination
of
woman
as
woman
to
man
as
man
woman
was
made
for
man
and
became
first
in
the
transgression
the
proper
condition
of
the
adult
female
is
marriage
the
general
rule
for
ladies
is
marriage
women
without
children
it
might
be
said
could
preach
but
they
are
under
the
general
rule
of
subordination
it
is
not
allowed
woman
to
speak
in
the
church
man
s
place
is
on
the
platform
it
is
positively
base
for
a
woman
to
speak
in
the
pulpit
it
is
base
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
the
whole
question
is
one
of
subordination
thus
before
a
vast
audience
largely
composed
of
women
craven
stood
and
with
denunciatory
manner
frequently
bringing
his
fists
on
his
bible
emphatically
down
devoted
a
four
hours
speech
to
proving
that
the
bible
taught
woman
s
subordination
to
man
his
arguments
were
the
same
as
those
of
the
church
in
the
past
and
were
based
upon
the
same
theory
viz
that
woman
was
created
inferior
man
man
and
was
the
first
in
sin
he
referred
to
the
fashions
as
aid
in
his
argument
saying
in
every
country
under
every
clime
from
the
peasant
woman
of
naples
with
a
handkerchief
over
her
hair
to
the
women
before
me
with
bonnets
every
one
wears
something
upon
her
head
in
token
of
craven
made
this
statement
in
direct
contradiction
to
historical
facts
which
prove
that
the
head
covering
is
always
removed
in
presence
of
a
superior
to
remain
bareheaded
is
an
act
of
deference
to
a
higher
authority
even
the
quaker
custom
of
men
s
wearing
the
hat
in
meeting
originated
as
an
act
of
defiance
to
the
anglican
church
craven
also
forgot
to
state
that
flowing
hair
has
always
been
regarded
as
an
emblem
of
superiority
and
freedom
clipped
hair
that
of
a
slave
or
prisoner
thus
craven
s
appeal
to
fashion
reacted
against
him
in
the
minds
of
all
historically
informed
persons
yet
together
with
his
other
statements
it
was
fully
endorsed
by
most
of
his
brother
clergymen
present
some
of
whom
enthusiastically
shouted
amen
at
the
close
of
his
speech
several
other
clergymen
gave
their
views
ballentine

the
subject
too
simple
for

argument

to
see
so
many
women
crowding
in
the
lecture

but
brother

should
not
take
all
the
glory
to
himself
he
was
glad
to
see
the
women
take
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
subject
under
discussion
but
as
he
looked
at
them
he
asked
himself
what
will
all
the
children
do
while
these
women
are
away
from
home
a
decision
of
censure
against
see
was
agreed
in
by
the
synod
of
new
jersey
and
confirmed
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
presbyterian
church
of
the
united
states
in
session
at
pittsburg
thus
we
find
that
the
christianity
of
today
continues
to
teach
the
existence
of
a
superior
and
an
inferior
sex
in
the
church
possessing
different
rights
and
held
accountable
to
a
different
code
of
morals

alone

the
idea
that

very
dress
was
typical
of
her
inferiority

character
as

pronounced
change
from

while
speaking
favorably
of

suffrage
still
betrayed
his
belief
in
the
old
theological
idea
that
women
brought
sin
into
the
world
through
which
her
subordination
to
man
ensued
but
like
see
he
limited
this
subordination
to
married
women
saying
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
i
deny
that
you
can
find
anywhere
in
the

s
subordination
till
she
sent
the
curse
of
sin
upon
the

that
relates
only
to

is
a
matter

the
spiritual
and
temporal
superiority
of
man
over

is
affirmed
by

in

a
few
years

made

the
subject
of
violent
attacks
as
an
inferior
and
subordinate
being
now
attempting
to
pass
beyond
the
bounds
set
by
god
for
her
restraint
there
is
a
more
emphatic
a
more
hopeless
degradation
for
her
it
is
seen
when
she
seeks
to
reverse
the
laws
of
her
nature
and
upset
the
economy
of
the
universe
pushing
her
way
out
of
her
own
sphere
into
a
rivalry
with
men
in
their
sphere
and
in
their
proper
pursuits
on
that
must
follow
a
degradation
greatly
to
be
feared
when
the
claim
for
rights
seems
to
be
taking
the
form
of
a
competition
with
man
on
a
field
which
god
has
reserved
for
man
only
in
a
work
not
suited

end
not
in
enhancing

of

but
in
making
her
offensive
and
detestable
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
patience
will
not
hold
out
and
of
this
let
the
woman
be
sure
that
if
she
go
too
far
the
end
will
arise
and
man
having
long
borne
her
manners
and
finding
that
she
is
becoming
a
social
nuisance
and
a
general
tormentor
will
finally
lose
all

wide
spreading
contempt
for
this
truth
exhibited
by
the
fashion
and
infidelity
of
the
age
is
one
of
the
most
alarming
symptoms
of
approaching
anarchy
and
the
overthrow
of
our
liberties
the
attempt
which
is
being
made
in
these
united
states
to
elevate
the
wife
to
a
perfect
equality
with
the
husband
or
to
change
in
any
respect
the
relation
between
them
established
by
god
himself
is
rank
infidelity
no
matter
what
specious
disguise
it
may
assume
in
a
sermon
of
his
lenten
series
entitled
the
calling
of
a
christian
woman
and
her
training
to
fulfill
it
dix
said
we
priests
who
whatever
our
personal
short
comings
have
a
commission
from
above
and
a
message
to
man
from
god
and
are
the
of
that
church
to
which
his
belong
may
be
and
ought
to
be
able
to
help
occasionally
by
merely
stating
what
the
bible
and
the
church
declare
on
certain
great
matters
on
which
many
lower
ones
depend
what
did
almighty
god
the
creator
the
wise
father
of
all
make
woman
for
what
did
he
intend
her
to
do
what
did
he
not
mean
her
to
do
or
try
to
do
he
answered
these
questions
in
a
lecture
entitled
a
mission
for
woman
of
the
same
series
looking
for
a
mission
for
a
work
to
do
this
is
the
attitude
of
many
women
today
you
hear
of
the
education
of
women
of
of
the
sexes
of
emancipation
of
woman
from
bonds
the
lord
only
knows
here
is
a
mission
worthy
of
yourselves
it
is
of
all
works
that
could
be
rendered
the
fittest
for
a
church
woman
because
she
was
at
the
beginning
of
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
we
believe
the
old
story
of
the
bible
by
christ
and
his
apostles
that
adam
was
not
deceived
by
the
devil
but
that
the
woman
being
deceived
was
in
the
transgression
now
to
her
with
whom
the
wrong
began
we
look
for
the
beginning
of
the
right
remember
that
in
the
woman
are
the
poles
of
the
good
and
the
evil
in
human
nature
when
she
is
good
she
is
the
best
of
all
that
exists
when
bad
the
worst
another
sermon
of
this
lenten
series
expressed
the
views
of
the
reverend
gentleman
upon
the
family
relation
bearing
of
children
and
divorce
in
which
he
expressed
his
hatred
of
modern
development
saying
i
feel
great
solicitude
about
the
subject
of
this
evening
s
lecture
i
had
rather
not
touch
it
at
all
you
may
think
that
its
selection
is
an
instance
of
that
disrespect
to
which
i
have
referred
not
so
oh
not
so
i
hold
the
old
ideas
i
abhor
and
detest
the
modern
development
before
any
woman
who
fears
god
does
her
duty
and
gives
us
in
her
life
and
acts
the
picture
of
a
true
and
beautiful
womanliness
i
rise
up
and
bless
her
and
do
her
reverent
homage
it
is
thus
in
no
spirit
of
assumption
that
i
shall
say
what
i
have
to
say
tonight
it
is
rather
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
of
wonder
of
expostulation
why
do
women
err
as
they
do
why
lower
themselves
to
men
s
level
why
should
the
queens
abdicate
their
thrones
and
go
down
to
the
ring
and
act
unseemly
parts
and
lay
their
honor
in
the
dust
let
us
think
this
evening
of
some
things
done
by
women
which
one
would
have
said
that
no
woman
with
a
woman
s
heart
and
a
woman
s
sense
could
after
due
reflection
justify
sins
fall
naturally
into
groups
or
classes
and
if
i
speak
this
evening
of
only
one
class
of
sins
it
is
because
the
time
does
not
permit
us
to
take
a
larger
survey
of
the
field
we
shall
limit
ourselves
then
to
these
topics
the
lack
of
serious
views
of
life
and
the
habit
of
turning
the
thoughts
exclusively
to
enjoyment
the
degradation
of
the
idea
of
matrimony
as
shown
by
entering
into
that
estate
for
low
and
unworthy
motives
the
deliberate
determination
of
some
married
women
to
defeat
the
objects
for
which
marriage
was
instituted
to
have
no
real
home
to
avoid
first
the
pains
and
next
the
cares
and
duties
of
maternity
the
habit
where
a
home
exists
of
neglecting
it
by
spending
most
of
the
time
away
from
it
running
up
and
down
in
pursuit
of
excitement
and
turning
their
children
over
to
the
care
of
servants
the
growing
indifference
to
the
chief
of
all
social
abominations
divorce
and
the
toleration
of
lax
notions
about
it
these
questions
of
most
vital
import
to
woman
to
her
material
condition
intellectual
development
and
place
in
the
church
rev
dix
and
the
great
body
of
the
church
deem
themselves
supremely
competent
to
adjust
without
woman
s
voice
upon
them
wherever
she
has
shown
her
views
upon
the
subject
of
education
industries
the
family
the
church
to
be
in
opposition
to
those
of
theologians
she
has
at
once
been
told
to
remain
in
her
old
position
of
inferiority
looking
up
to
man
as
her
divinely
appointed
master
and
spiritual
head
dix
in
his
lectures
but
gave
the
views
of
priests
of
all
denominations
at
the
present
day
despite
the
advancing
civilization
of
the
age
and
the
fact
that
in
so
many
avocations
woman
has
shown
her
capacity
for
taking
equal
part
with
man
we
find
theology
still
unprogressive
a
portion
of
the
press
however
severely
criticised
these
discourses
the
lenten
pastoral
of
rev
cleveland
coxe
bishop
of
western
new
york
to
the
laity
of
his
diocese
contained
a
reminder
to
women
of
the
impurity
of
motherhood
in
the
demand
made
for
church
cleansing
subsequent
to
her
bringing
an
immortal
being
into
life
christian
women
active
as
they
often
are
above
all
comparison
with
men
are
yet
sometimes
negligent
of
their
immediate
duties
as
wives
and
mothers
and
fail
to
exert
that
healthful
influence
over
the
family
which
god
has
made
it
the
high
privilege
of
woman
to
exercise
in
this
sphere
of
her
duty
and
her
glory
the
office
for
the
churching
of
women
testifies
against
those
who
neglect
it
as
forgetting
the
dignity
of
motherhood
and
that
gratitude
to
god
which
every
woman
owes
to
the
christian
religion
for
enthroning
her
in
the
household
and
making
the
example
of
the
blessed
among
women
her
peculiar
lesson
and
incentive
to
piety
many
portions
of
this
advice
is
an
open
insult
to
woman
and
could
the
divine
but
see
it
is
even
from
the
christian
standard
an
imputation
upon
that
being
he
professes
to
revere
as
the
creator
of
the
universe
a
work
was
recently
written
by
an
english
bishop
bearing
upon
the
governmental
effort
for
repeal
of
the
law
forbidding
marriage
with
a
deceased
wife
s
sister
or
brother
this
work
was
written
for
the
express
purpose
of
proving
that
while
it
is
eminently
improper
and
sinful
for
a
woman
to
marry
her
deceased
husband
s
brother
it
is
eminently
proper
and
right
for
a
man
to
marry
his
deceased
wife
s
sister
and
this
upon
the
same
principle
that
governed
the
disinheritance
of
woman
under
the
salic
law
because
by
marriage
a
woman
becomes
merged
into
her
husband
s
family
he
specifically
declares
that
the
sister
of
the
wife
is
in
no
sense
the
sister
of
the
husband
therefore
it
is
permissible
for
a
man
to
marry
his
wife
s
sisters
successively
but
he
affirms
that
to
the
contrary
the
widow
can
not
marry
her
deceased
husband
s
brother
as
by
the
act
of
her
marriage
she
became
a
part
of
her
husband
s
family
a
second
marriage
to
such
husband
s
brother
thereby
becoming
incestuous
this
is
the
law
of
england
both
religious
and
civil
a
striking
evidence
of
the
incongruity
of
this
law
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
illegitimacy
of
such
brother
is
held
to
destroy
the
relationship
as
by
law
of
both
church
and
state
an
illegitimate
child
is
not
held
as
related
to
its
father
he
is
the
son
of
nobody
a
woman
can
marry
two
brothers
in
succession
one
the
child
of
marriage
the
other
a
child
of
the
same
father
born
outside
of
the
marriage
relation
the
son
of
nobody
a
being
unfathered
in
the
eye
of
the
law
is
the
brother
of
nobody
a
striking
instance
of
the
effect
of
this
law
occurred
in
england
within
the
past
few
years
when
a
lady
successively
married
two
brothers
the
first
a
natural
son
of
the
earl
of
waldegrave
the
second
his
legitimate
son
the
father
although
not
recognized
as
such
in
law
left
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
his
natural
son
the
title
over
which
he
had
no
power
of
alienation
descending
to
the
son
born
under
authority
of
the
church
the
first
husband
dying
the
lady
afterward
married
the
legitimate
son
thus
becoming
first
waldegrave
and
afterwards
lady
waldegrave
securing
both
fortune
and
title
by
her
marriage
with
the
and
sons
of
the
same
father
and
breaking
neither
the
law
of
state
or
church
in
so
doing
american
clergymen
of
the
episcopal
church
have
expressed
views
in
accordance
with
those
of
the
english
bishop
rev
george
zabriskie
gray
dean
of
the
episcopal
theological
school
of
cambridge
published
a
work
in
entitled
husband
and
wife
also
suggested
by
the
constantly
debated
english
question
of
state
concerning
the
lawfulness
of
marriage
with
a
deceased
wife
s
sister
gray
coincides
with
many
of
his
reverend
brethren
in
the
declaration
that
with
the
wife
no
liberty
of
divorce
is
allowable
but
his
reasons
present
somewhat
the
freshness
of
novelty
as
previously
stated
the
of
husband
and
wife
was
at
one
time
the
general
christian
belief
while
like
the
english
bishop
rev
gray
admits
the
relationship
of
the
wife
to
the
husband
to
such
extent
that
becoming
fully
absorbed
by
him
his
relatives
become
hers
like
the
english
bishop
he
further
declares
that
in
consequence
of
this
absorption
the
wife
loses
her
former
family
relationship
her
mother
and
father
her
sister
or
brother
no
longer
bearing
relationship
to
her
but
have
become
to
her
as
strangers
he
said
the
wife
becomes
a
member
of
his
family
while
he
does
not
become
one
of
her
own
the
equilateral
idea
is
a
physiological
and
psychological
impossibility
the
unity
is
in
the
man
the
woman
by
marriage
becomes
a
member
of
the
man
therefore
she
can
not
put
him
away
for
a
member
can
not
put
away
the
head
the
impurity
of
the
wife
imperils
the
family
renders
pedigree
and
all
concerned
therein
uncertain
and
so
she
may
be
put
away
but
the
husband
s
unchastity
while
it
may
be
as
sinful
yet
has
no
such
effect
it
does
not
render
it
doubtful
who
are
rightful
children
of
his
stock
who
are
entitled
to
the
name
that
he
and
his
wife
both
bear
and
therefore
does
not
call
for
the
severance
of
the
marriage
tie
that
is
the
dissolution
of
the
family
that
is
divorce
so
far
as
scripture
goes
seems
to
be
a
measure
for
the
protection
of
the
family
and
of
the
rightful
inheritance
of
whatever
is
to
be
transmitted
to
the
children
and
so
a
remedy
open
only
to
man
there
seems
to
be
no
way
of
preventing
the
abuse
of
divorce
if
any
principle
is
admitted
that
will
extend
it
to
woman
under
this
form
of
reasoning
both
gray
and
the
english
bishop
dispose
with
ease
of
the
state
obstacle
to
marriage
with
a
deceased
wife
s
sister
inasmuch
as
by
marriage
the
husband
forms
no
ties
of
consanguinity
with
the
wife
s
family
she
having
become
a
member
of
his
family
without
his
having
become
a
member
of
hers
marriage
with
his
deceased
wife
s
sister
would
be
the
same
as
marriage
with
an
entire
stranger
saying
as
the
husband
enters
into
no
connection
with
the
wife
s
family
her
sisters
are
no
more
his
sisters
than
they
had
been
before
therefore
he
may
marry
one
of
them
as
freely
as
any
one
else
as
far
as
any
real
principle
involved
in
matrimony
is
concerned
the
of
boston
commenting
upon
gray
s
work
although
itself
a
recognized
organ
of
the
unitarian
church
yet
in
a
spirit
more
in
accord
with
modern
thought
carefully
corrected
the
size
of
type
in
the
word
wife
upon
the
and
outside
of
the
book
thus
husband
and
wife
also
facetiously
referring
to
the
late
artemus
ward
who
at
time
of
the
late
civil
war
was
ready
to
sacrifice
all
his
wife
s
relations
these
two
works
of
the
english
bishop
and
the
american
dean
are
consistent
with
the
teaching
of
the
christian
ages
in
reference
to
woman
not
held
as
belonging
primarily
to
herself
but
ever
to
some
man
her
very
relationship
to
the
mother
who
brought
her
into
life
destroyed
by
law
she
once
again
through
the
church
is
presented
to
the
world
as
a
being
without
a
birthright
not
even
receiving
for
it

mess
of
pottage
or

existence
rev
a
high
church
clergyman
of
england
traveled
in
the
united
states
in
the
fall
of
during
his
stay
in
philadelphia
he
preached
a
sermon
to
women
in
the
large
church
of
clements
as
reported
in
the
of
that
city
its
chief
features
were
a
representation
of
woman
s
inferior
intellect
her
duty
of
unqualified
obedience
to
her
husband
however
evil
his
life
the
sinfulness
of
divorce

the
blessedness
of
a
large
family
of
children
he
said
god
made
himself
to
be
born
of
a
woman
to
sanctify
the
virtue
of
endurance
loving
submission
is
an
attribute
of
woman
men
are
logical
but
women
lacking
this
quality
have
an
intricacy
of
thought
there
are
those
who
think
woman
can
be
taught
logic
this
is
a
mistake
they
can
never
by
any
power
of
education
arrive
at
the
same
mental
status
as
that
enjoyed
by
man
but
they
have
a
quickness
of
apprehension
which
is
usually
called
leaping
at
conclusions
that
is
astonishing
there
then
we
have
distinctive
traits
of
a
woman
namely
endurance
loving
submission
and
quickness
of
apprehension
wifehood
is
the
crowning
glory
of
a
woman
in
it
she
is
bound
for
all
time
to
her
husband
she
owes
the
duty
of
unqualified
obedience
there
is
no
crime
which
a
man
can
commit
which
justifies
his
wife
in
leaving
him
or
applying
for
that
monstrous
thing
divorce
it
is
her
duty
to
subject
herself
to
him
always
and
no
crime
that
he
can
commit
can
justify
her
lack
of
obedience
if
he
be
a
bad
or
wicked
man
she
may
gently
remonstrate
with
him
but

this

o
my
sister
this
is
part
of
divine
discipline
it
should
require
but
little
thought
upon
woman
s
part
to
see
how
closely
her
disabilities
are
interwoven
with
present
religious
belief
and
teaching
as
to
her
inferiority
and
subordination
if
she
needs
aid
to
thought
the
cravens
the
the
talmages
will
help
her
the
spirit
of
the
priesthood
protestant
equally
with
catholic
is
that
of
the
early
and
middle
ages
the
foundation
being
the
same
the
teaching
is
of
similar
character
from
the
sermons
referred
to
we
can
justly
declare
they
express
the
opinions
of
the
priesthood
as
a
body
we
meet
no
protest
against
them
not
a
single
church
has
denied
these
degrading
theories
no
clergyman
has
preached
against
the
doctrines
mentioned
blasphemous
as
they
are
against
the
primal
rights
of
the
soul
these
sermons
stand
as
representatives
not
only
of
high
church
theology
in
regard
to
woman
but
as
expressing
the
belief
of
all
churches
in
her
creation
and
existence
as
an
inferior
and
appendage
to
man
all
her
suffering
material
or
spiritual
her
restrictions
her
sorrows
her
deprivation
of
the
right
of
unrestricted
conscience
are
depicted
as
parts
of
her
divine
discipline
which
she
must
accept
with
endurance
and
loving
submission
even
from
the
criminal
she
is
not
to
free
herself
or
refuse
him
obedience
scarcely
a
protestant
sect
that
has
not
within
a
few
years
in
some
way
placed
itself
upon
record
as
sustaining
the
doctrine
of
woman
s
subordination
the
council
that
assembled
in
edinburg
a
few
years
since
refused
to
admit
a
woman
even
as
a
listener
to
its
proceedings
although
women
constitute
at
least
of
the
membership
of
that
church
a
solitary
woman
who
persisted
in
remaining
to
listen
to
the
discussions
of
this
body
was
removed
by
force
six
stalwart
presbyterians
lending
their
ungentle
aid
to
her
ejection
the
same
body
in
session
in
philadelphia
the
summer
of
laughed
to
scorn
the
suggestion
of
a
liberal
member
that
the
status
to
woman
in
that
church
should
receive
some
consideration
referring
to
the
work
of
the
sisters
of
charity
in
the
catholic
church
and
that
of
women
among
the
quakers
although
this
question
was
twice
introduced
it
was
as
often
met
with
derisive
laughter
and
no
action
was
taken
upon
it
but
had
this
liberal
member
been
wise
enough
to
have
brought
before
this
body
the
fact
that
the
presbyterian
church
is
losing
its
political
influence
because
of
the
great
preponderance
of
its
women
members
without
the
ballot
he
would
have
received
more
consideration
as
all
churches
seek
influence
in
politics
we
may
rest
assured
that
when
the
church
as
a
whole
or
any
sect
thereof
shall
be
found
sustaining
the
political
rights
of
woman
or
her
religious
equality
in
the
church
it
will
be
from
the
worldly
wisdom
of
a
desire
to
retain
fleeting
political
power
the
life
or
the
death
of
the
church
largely
depends
upon
its
political
forethought
differing
political
rights
have
ever
been
productive
of
diverse
moral
codes
what
was
considered
right
for
the
king
and
the
nobility
has
ever
been
wrong
for
the
peasant
the
moral
rights
of
the
master
and
the
slave
were
ever
dissimilar
while
under
christianity
two
codes
of
morals
have
ever
been
extant
the
lax
code
for
man
the
strict
for
woman
this
diversity
is
shown
by
the
different
position
that
society
accords
to
an
immoral
man
and
an
immoral
woman
but
nowhere
is
the
recognition
of
differing
codes
of
morals
for
man
and
woman
as
clearly
shown
as
in
the
church
as
presented
in
discourses
of
clergymen
to
them
adultery
in
the
husband
is
merely
a
pastime
in
which
he
can
indulge
without
injury
to
his
wife
who
is
powerless
to
put
him
away
nor
has
she
been
wronged
but
to
the
contrary
under
the
same
teaching
should
the
wife
prove
thus
unfaithful
she
should
immediately
be
cast
out
colored
pastors
unite
with
their
white
brethren
in
denying
woman
s
moral
spiritual
or
personal
equality
with
man
rev
alexander
crummel
a
colored
clergyman
of
washington
rector
of
lukes
episcopal
church
in
preached
a
sermon
upon
the
biblical
position
of
woman
which
was
published
in
tract
form
for
circulation
he
referred
to
her
as
having
been
created
inferior
to
man
with
no
right
natural
or
acquired
by
creation
or
revelation
to
govern
herself
or
hold
opinions
of
her
own
this
marriage
and
divorce
down
the
following
principles
marriage
is
a
divine
institution
it
came
from
god
it
is
not
therefore
the
creation
of
legislative
action
it
is
not
merely
a
civil
contract
it
is
not
the
invention
of
man
the
estate
of
matrimony
is
a
sacred
one
originated
by
the
will
of
god
and
governed
by
his
law
marriage
is
indissoluble
adultery
on
part
of
the
wife
is
ground
for
divorce
thus
far
we
have
considered
the
case
with
reference
to
the
unfaithfulness
of
the
wife
and
have
shown
that
when
a
woman
violates
the
covenant
of
marriage
by
adultery
her
husband
has
the
right
to
divorce
her
but
now
the
question
comes
is
not
this
a
reciprocal
right
when
husbands
are
unfaithful
have
not
wives
the
right
to
divorce
them
my
reply
is
that
no
warrant
for
such
divorce
can
be
found
in
the
bible
under
both
covenants
the
right
of
divorce
is
given
exclusively
to
husband
the
right
in
all
cases
is
guaranteed
to
the
man
only
and
so
far
forth
we
have
the
word
of
god
for
its
specific
reservation
to
husbands
in
no
case
is
it
even
hinted
that
a
woman
has
the
right
of
divorce
if
even
her
husband
be
guilty
of
unfaithfulness
there
is
a
broad
general
obligation
laid
upon
woman
in
the
marriage
relation
the
sum
of
the
matter
respecting
the
woman
seems
to
be
this
the
woman
is
bound
by
the
ties
of
wedlock
during
the
whole
period
of
her
husband
s
life
and
even
under
distressful
circumstances
has
no
right
to
break
them
by
divorce
the
additional
reasons
presented
by
rev
crummel
against
woman
s
right
of
divorce
even
for
the
infidelity
of
the
husband
are
the
hidden
mystery
of
generation
the
wondrous
secret
of
propagated
life
committed
to
the
trust
of
in
thus
referring
to
those
laws
of
nature
whose
conditions
are
not
yet
fully
understood
rev
crummel
presented
the
strongest
reasons
why
the
mother
and
not
the
father
should
be
regarded
as
the
true
head
of
the
family
this
hidden
mystery
of
generation
this
wondrous
secret
of
propagated
life
committed
to
the
trust
of
woman
most
forcibly
demonstrates
that
she
should
be
the
one
in
whose
power
is
placed
the
opportunity
for
escape
from
an
adulterous
husband
thus
enabling
her
to
keep
her
body
a
holy
temple
for
its
uses
over
which
as
priestess
she
alone
should
possess
control
the
assertion
of
rev
alexander
crummel
that
an
adulterous
husband
can
not
do
the
same
wrong
to
the
wife
that
the
wife
does
to
the
husband
under
similar
circumstances
is
absolutely
false
by
reason
of
certain
physiological
mysteries
to
which
he
refers
but
to
which
he
also
shows
absolute
ignorance
the
wrong
done
woman
by
reason
of
her
potential
motherhood
is
infinitely
greater
to
her
than
similar
infidelity
upon
her
part
can
possibly
be
to
the
husband
and
not
to
her
alone
but
to
the
children
whom
she
may
bring
to
life
his
attempted
justification
of
the
husband
s
adultery
upon
the
plea
that
when
a
man
begets
bastard
children
he
does
so
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
home
and
so
can
not
foist
spurious
children
upon
the
household
and
the
family
is
kept
together
are
most
sophistical
and
fallacious
methods
of
reasoning
entirely
inimical
to
truth
and
purity
of
an
absolutely
selfish
and
libidinous
character
they
have
been
used
by
profligates
in
the
church
and
in
the
state
as
pleas
for
a
license
that
has
no
regard
to
the
rights
of
woman
or
the
duties
of
fatherhood
and
are
not
only
essentially
immoral
in
themselves
but
are
equally
destructive
of
personal
and
social
purity
the
individual
and
not
the
family
is
the
social
unit
the
rights
of
individuals
are
foremost
immorality
of
man
everywhere
presents
a
more
serious
and
destructive
aspect
than
that
of
woman
aside
from
the
unmarried
mother
whom
society
does
not
recognize
as
longer
a
part
of
it
is
the
irreparable
wrong
done
to
those
innocent
human
beings
whom
rev
crummel
designates
as
spurious
children
whom
the
catholics
call
sacrilegious
when
the
father
is
shown
to
be
a
priest
and
upon
whom
society
at
large
terms
closely
connected
with
injury
to
the
innocent
child
itself
thrust
into
being
without
provision
for
its
future
needs
is
the
detriment
to
society
which
thus
finds
itself
compelled
to
assume
the
duties
belonging
to
the
bastard
s
father
such
children
for
whom
neither
home
nor
fatherly
care
awaits
are
allowed
by
him
to
grow
up
neglected
street
waifs
uneducated
untrained
uncared
for
filling
reformatories
and
prisons
of
the
land
perhaps
to
die
upon
the
gallows
the
responsibility
of
such
fathers
is
not
a
subject
of
church
teaching
it
is
simply
passed
carelessly
by
regardless
of
the
unspeakable
wrongs
connected
with
it
if
as
the
rev
turnstall
asserts
the
bible
is
not
for
woman
if
his
position
is
true
or
if
that
of
the
jews
who
claim
that
the
ten
commandments
were
given
to
man
alone
is
true
it
is
to
man
alone
that
adultery
is
forbidden
luther
asserted
that
the
ten
commandments
applied
to
neither
gentiles
nor
christians
but
only
to
the
jews
it
was
to
man
alone
that
christ
spoke
against
adultery
saying
whosoever
looketh
upon
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
already
committed
adultery
with
her
in
his
to
man
christ
also
said
owing
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
moses
permitted
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
but
it
was
not
so
from
the
man
and
not
woman
is
commanded
to
leave
father
and
mother
man
is
to
cleave
unto
his
wife
not
woman
unto
her
husband
it
was
the
men
of
corinth
whom
paul
addressed
concerning
lewdness
such
fornication
was
never
known
among
the
heathen
as
that
a
man
should
take
his
father
s
one
of
the
most
remarkable
facts
connected
with
church
teaching
is
the
lightness
with
which
such
positive
declarations
of
christ
as
to
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
are
cast
aside
or
his
teaching
entirely
reversed
in
order
that
man
may
receive
license
for
an
immorality
forbidden
to
woman
it
must
be
noted
that
the
chief
reason
given
by
the
church
for
assuming
woman
s
greater
guilt
in
committing
adultery
is
not
based
upon
the
greater
immorality
of
the
act
but
the
injury
to
property
rights
succession
etc
it
must
also
be
noted
that
the
great
objection
of
the
church
to
divorce
on
part
of
woman
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
wife
thus
escapes
from
a
condition
of
bondage
to
one
of
comparative
freedom
in
securing
a
divorce
she
repudiates
the
husband
s
headship
she
thus
subverts
his
authority
by
this
act
she
places
herself
upon
an
equality
of
moral
and
property
rights
with
man
and
the
church
not
admitting
such
equality
between
man
and
woman
is
hostile
to
divorce
upon
her
part
every
new
security
gained
by
woman
for
the
protection
of
her
civil
rights
in
or
out
of
the
family
is
a
direct
blow
at
the
church
theory
of
her
inferiority
and
subordination
her
full
freedom
is
to
be
looked
for
through
her
increased
legal
and
political
rights
and
not
through
the
church
during
the
same
year
of
the
remarkable
sermon
by
rev
alexander
crummel
rev
dilke
read
a
paper
before
the
social
science
association
at
saratoga
entitled
lax
divorce
he
showed
the
same
disregard
for
the
rights
of
the
individual
when
the
individual
was
a
wife
as
his
brother
clergymen
saying
our
lax
divorce
system
treats
the
wrongs
of
the
wife
chiefly
as
those
of
a
mere
he
was
assiduous
in
his
regard
for
the
protection
of
the
womanly
nature
recognizing
sex
her
sex
as
a
profound
fact
in
nature
but
why
the
sex
of
woman
should
be
a
more
profound
fact
than
the
sex
of
man
he
did
not
show
that
woman
now
claims
a
recognition
of
her
individuality
as
a
being
possessed
of
personal
rights
is
the
basis
of
present
attack
upon
divorce
by
the
church
nor
is
the
state
more
ready
to
admit
her
individual
representation
and
personal
rights
of
in
march
rev
hurlbert
preached
a
sermon
in
the
first
baptist
church
of
san
francisco
on
the
relation
of
husband
and
wife
afterward
published
in
which
he
said
the
principal
objection
to
the
episcopal
marriage
service
raised
by
the
woman
of
the
period
is
that
it
requires
her
to
her
husband
but
this
objection
is
leveled
equally
against
the
requirement
of
the
word
of
god
and
furthermore
the
additional
promise
to
honor
and
love
him
can
only
be
kept
in
the
spirit
of
obedience
this
obligation
is
founded
upon
the
fact
that
he
is
her
husband
and
if
she
can
not
reverence
him
for
what
he
is
in
himself
still
she
must
reverence
him
for
the
position
which
he
holds
and
again
she
must
render
this
submissive
reverence
to
her
husband
s
headship
as
unto
the
lord
as
is
fit
in
the
lord
she
reverences
him
not
simply
as
a
man
but
as
her
own
husband
behind
whom
stands
the
lord
himself
it
is
the
lord
who
has
made
him
husband
and
the
honor
with
which
she
regards
him
though
himself
personally
not
deserving
it
is
in
reality
an
honoring
of
the
lord
many
a
christian
woman
actuated
by
this
motive
has
been
most
tenderly
submissive
dutiful
and
patient
as
towards
the
most
unreasonable
and
despotic
of
by
the
remembrance
that
it
was
a
service
rendered
unto
christ
let
the
wife
then
reverence
her
husband
for
what
he
is
in
himself
for
his
loving
and
noble
qualities
but
if
these
qualities
do
not
belong
to
him
then
let
her
reverence
him
for
the
sake
of
his
because
he
is
her
in
either
event
let
her
reverence
him
because
in
doing
so
she
is
honoring
the
lord
and
savior
it
is
but
a
short
time
since
the
pastor
of
the
swedenborgian
church
washington
as
reported
by
one
of
his
flock
expressed
to
that
body
his
opinion
that
the
church
had
better
remain
unrepresented
rather
than
have
women
represent
it
and
this
although
of
his
congregation
are
women
it
is
however
pleasing
to
state
that
the
committee
for
that
purpose
elected
an
equal
number
of
women
with
men
the
efforts
of
the
pastor
against
woman
securing
but
seven
votes
the
unitarian
and
universalist
churches
which
ordain
women
to
preach
and
administer
the
ordinances
still
make
these
women
pastors
feel
that
the
innovation
is
not
a
universally
acceptable
one
in
a
lengthy
pastoral
letter
issued
by
the
episcopal
convention
held
in
chicago
a
few
years
since
it
was
asserted
that
the
claim
of
the
wife
to
an
equal
right
with
her
husband
to
the
control
of
her
person
her
property
and
her
earnings
was
disparaging
the
christian
law
of
the
the
methodist
church
still
refuses
to
place
woman
upon
an
equality
with
man
either
in
the
ministry
or
in
lay
representation
a
few
years
since
taking
from
them
their
previous
license
to
preach
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
van
cott
a
woman
evangelist
did
such
severe
work
during
a
period
of
fourteen
years
as
to
seriously
injure
her
health
and
so
successful
were
her
ministrations
that
she
brought
more
converts
to
the
church
than
a
dozen
of
its
most
influential
bishops
during
the
same
time
to
such
bitter
lengths
has
opposition
to
woman
s
ordination

carried
in

rev
buckley
editor
of

debating
the
subject
declared
that
he
would
oppose
the
admission
of
the
mother
of
our
lord
into

ministry
the
debate
taking
on
most
unseemly
form
miss
oliver
who
had
long
been
pastor
of
the
willoughby
street
church
in
brooklyn
appealed
to
the
general
conference
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
at
its
session
in
cincinnati
may
for
full
installment
and
ordination
saying
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
our
dear
mother
church
with
any
perplexing
question
but
it
presses
me
also
and
the
church
and
myself
must
decide
something
i
am
so
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
lord
has
laid
commands
upon
me
in
this
direction
that
it
becomes
with
me
really
a
question
of
my
own
soul
s
she
then
gave
the
reasons
that
induce
her
to
believe
that
she
is
called
to
pastoral
work
and
concluded
i
have
made
almost
every
conceivable
sacrifice
to
do
what
i
believe
to
be
god
s
will
brought
up
in
a
conservative
circle
in
new
york
city
that
held
it
a
disgrace
for
a
woman
to
work
surrounded
with
the
comforts
and
advantages
of
ample
means
and
trained
in
the
episcopal
church
i
gave
up
home
friends
and
support
went
counter
to
prejudices
that
had
become
second
nature
to
me
worked
several
years
to
constant
exhaustion
and
suffered
cold
hunger
and
loneliness
the
things
hardest
for
me
to
bear
were
laid
upon
me
for
two
months
my
own
mother
would
not
speak
to
me
when
i
entered
the
house
she
turned
and
walked
away
and
when
i
sat
at
the
table
she
did
not
recognize
me
i
have
passed
through
tortures
to
which
the
flames
of
martyrdom
would
be
nothing
for
they
would
end
in
a
day
and
through
all
this
time
and
today
i
could
turn
off
to
positions
of
comparative
ease
and
profit
i
ask
you
fathers
and
brethren
tell
me
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
tell
me
what
would
you
wish
the
church
to
do
toward
you
were
you
in
my
place
please
only
apply
the
golden
rule
and
vote
in
conference
in
answer
to
this
powerful
and
noble
appeal
and
in
reply
to
all
women
seeking
the
ministry
of
that
church
the
general
conference
passed
this
resolution
resolved
that
women
have
already
all
the
rights
and
privileges
in
the
methodist
church
that
are
good
for
them
and
that
it
is
not
expedient
to
make
any
change
in
the
books
of
discipline
that
would
open
the
doors
for
their
ordination
to
the
ministry
the
general
conference
after
so
summarily
deciding
what
was
for
the
spiritual
good
of
women
in
thus
refusing
to
recognize
their
equality
of
rights
to
the
offices
of
that
church
resolved
itself
as
a
whole
into
a
political
convention
adjourning
in
a
body
to
chicago
before
its
religious
business
was
finished
in
order
that
its
presence
might
influence

years

his

in

by
implication
those
of

church
he
declared
woman
to
be
under
the
curse
of
subjection
to
man
a
curse
not
removable
until
the
resurrection
he
said
that
under

woman
had
no
voice
in
anything
that
she
could
hold
no
office
yet
did
so
in
a
few
instances
when
god
wished
to
especially
humiliate
the
nation
that
she
was
scheduled
as
a
higher
piece
of
property
that
even
the
bible
was
not
addressed
to
her
but
to
man
alone
woman
finding
her
salvation
even
under
the
new
covenant
not
directly
through
jesus
but
approaching
him
through
man
his
points
were
first
that
woman
is
under
a
curse
which
subjects
her
to
man
second
this
curse
has
never
been
removed
nor
will
it
be
removed
until
the
resurrection
third
that
woman
under

did
she
except
in
a
few
instances
when
to
reproach
and
humiliate
the
nation
god
suspended
his
own
law
and
made
an
instrument
of
women
for
the
time
being
that
she
offered
no
sacrifices
no
redemption
money
was
paid
for
her
that
she
received
no
religious
rites
that
the
mother
s
cleansing
was
forty
days
longer
and
the
gift
was
smaller
for
a

for

with
leprosy
and
that
under
the
new
covenant
she
is
only
permitted
to
pray
or
prophesy
with
her
head
covered
which
accounts
for
the
fashion
of
wearing
bonnets
in
public
to
this
day
that
she
is
expressly
prohibited
from
rule
in
the
church
or
usurpation
of

carrying
with
it
all
the
collaterals

executing

that
god
has
withheld
from
woman
the
right
to
rule
either
in
the
church
the
state
or
the
family
that
he
did
this
because
of
her
having
brought
sin
and
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
sixth
that
the
bible
is
addressed
to
man
and
not
to
woman
that
man
comes
to
god
through
jesus
and
woman
comes
to
jesus
through
man
that
every
privilege
the
wife
enjoys
she
but
receives
through
the
husband
for
god
has
declared
that
woman
shall
not
rule
man
but
be
subject
unto
him
a
more
explicit
statement
of
the
opinion
of
the
church
regarding
woman
is
seldom
found
later
action
of
the
methodist
body
proves
its
agreement
with
rev
turnstall
the
general
conference
of
that
church
convened
may
in
the
metropolitan
opera
house
new
york
numbering
delegates
from
every
part
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
many
from
foreign
lands
among
these
delegates
were
sixteen
women
the
question
of
their
admission
came
up
the
first
day
the
senior
bishop
rev
thomas
bowman
in
his
opening
remarks
declared
that
body
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
new
conditions
in
that
they
found
names
upon
the
roll
of
a
class
of
persons
whose
eligibility
had
never
been
determined
by
the
high
tribunal
of
the
church
a
committee
was
appointed
to
report
upon
their
admission
bishop
merrill
occupying
the
chair
upon
the
second
day
said
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
conference
women
had
been
sent
as
delegates
but
the
bishops
did
not
think
the
women
were
eligible
the
report
of
the
committee
was
submitted
which
declared
that
after
a
serious
discussion
they
had
become
convinced
that
while
the
rule
was
passed
relating
to
the
admission
of
lay
delegates
to
the
general
conference
the
church
contemplated
admission
only
to
men
as
lay
delegates
and
that
under
the
constitution
and
laws
women
were
not
eligible
the
committee
agreed
that
the
protest
against
women
should
be
sustained
and
the
conferences
from
which
they
were
sent
be
notified
that
their
seats
were
vacant
a
long
discussion
ensued
rev
john
wiley
president
of
the
drew
theological
seminary
of
the
new
york
conference
spoke
against
woman
s
admission
saying
that
if
the
laws
of
the
church
were
properly
interpreted
they
would
prove
that
women
are
not
eligible
and
then
besides
no
one
wanted
them
in
the
general
conference
rev
day
the
new
york
conference
argued
against
the
admission
of
women
saying
when
the
law
was
passed
for
the
admission
of
lay
delegates
it
was
never
intended
that
women
should
be
delegates
to
the
general
conference
it
is
proposed
today
to
make
one
of
the
most
stupendous
pieces
of
legislation
that
has
been
known
to
christendom
i
am
not
opposed
to
woman
doing
the
work
that
she
is
capable
of
doing
but
i
do
not
think
that
she
should
intrude
upon
the
general
conference
woman
has
not
the
necessary
experience
this
is
a
tremendous
question
rev
jacob
rothweiler
of
the
central
german
conference
asserted
that
the
opponents
of
the
report
are
trying
to
override
the
constitution
of
the
church
and
are
making
an
effort
to
strike
at
the
conscientiousness
of
per
cent
of
the
christian
church
which
has
existed
for
the
last
years
the
history
of
christianity
shows
that
women
were
never
intended
to
vote
the
conference
was
seriously
divided
upon
this
question
although
eventually
lost
yet
many
clergymen
permeated
with
the
spirit
of
advancing
civilization
voted
in
its
favor
among
them
rev
hammond
of
syracuse
new
york
a
delegate
for
the
episcopacy
while
arrayed
in
bitter
opposition
was
rev
buckley
editor
of
christian
also
a
candidate
for
the
bishopric
and
the
man
that
when
the
question
of
the
ordination
of
miss
oliver
came
up
a
few
years
since
declared
he
would
oppose
the
admission
of
the
mother
of
the
lord
to
the
ministry
his
remark
recalls
that
of
tetzel
the
great
catholic
dealer
in
indulgences
given
in
another
part
of
this
work
and
illustrates
to
what
extent
of
blasphemy
the
opponents
of
women
s
equality
proceed
it
was
not
until
the
seventh
day
of
the
conference
that
the
question
of
woman
s
admission
was
decided
in
the
negative
and
the
great
methodist
episcopal
church
put
itself
upon
record
as
opposed
to
the
recognition
of
more
than
one
half
of
its
members
the
women
delegates
were
not
even
allowed
seats
upon
the
floor
during
the
debate
nind
president
of
the
woman
s
foreign
missionary
society
arose
to
vote
but
was
not
counted
although
the
woman
s
foreign
missionary
societies
are
making
converts
where
men
can
not
the
zenanas
the
action
of
the
conference
was
foreshadowed
by
that
of
baltimore
a
few
weeks
previously
when
it
was
decided
that
women
missionaries
should
not
be
permitted
to
administer
communion
in
the
zenanas
as
it
would
open
the
door
for
their
ordination
to
the
ministry
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
women
alone
are
admitted
to
the
zenanas
at
the
methodist
minister
s
meeting
syracuse
near
time
of
the
general
conference
rev
thomas
tinsey
of
clyde
read
a
paper
entitled
is
it
advisable
to
make
women
of
the
church
eligible
to
all
the
ecclesiastical
councils
and
the
ministerial
order
of
the
church
quoting
paul
in
opposition
to
giving
her
a
voice
saying
what
can
our
modern
advocates
of
licensing
and
ordaining
women
and
electing
them
to
annual
conferences
do
with
the
command
to
the
corinthians
let
your
women
keep
silence
in
the
church
or
to
timothy
let
the
women
learn
in
silence
and
all
subjection
paul
certainly
meant
something
by
such
teaching
the
position
taken
by
the
fathers
of
methodism
appears
to
me
to
be
the
only
tenable
one
viz
that
the
prohibition
applies
to
the
legislation
or
official
business
of
the
the
kind
of
work
contemplated
in
the
effort
to
make
them
eligible
to
the
general
conference
and
to
methodist
orders
concerning
these
things
let
them
learn
of
their
husbands
at
rev
tinsey
farther
gave
his
opinion
as
to
the
comparative
uselessness
of
woman
he
was
able
to
conceive
of
no
good
reason
for
her
creation
aside
from
that
of
burden
bearer
in
the
process
of
reproduction
saying
woman
is
that
part
or
side
of
humanity
upon
which
the
great
labor
care
and
burden
of
reproduction
is
placed
we
can
conceive
of
no
good
reason
for
making
women
aside
from
this
man
is
certainly
better
suited
to
all
other
work
after
discussion
the
ministers
present
generally
agreed
that
because
of
motherhood
woman
should
be
debarred
from
such
official
recognition
the
final
ground
of
women
s
exclusion
as
delegates
to
the
general
conference
is
most
noticeable
inasmuch
as
appeal
was
ultimately
made
to
the
state
upon
the
seventh
day
s
session
it
was
resolved
to
suspend
the
rules
and
continue
the
debate
on
the
admission
of
women
as
so
anxious
were
men
to
speak
that
delegates
at
once
sprung
to
their
feet
and
claimed
the
floor
judge
taylor
a
lay
delegate
from
the
louis
conference
walking
down
the
aisle
with
a
number
of
law
books
under
his
arm
proceeded
to
argue
the
question
on
constitutional
grounds
saying
it
would
do
much
harm
to
admit
women
at
the
present
time
there
are
bishops
to
be
elected
and
other
important
matters
to
be
voted
on
and
if
women
are
admitted
and
allowed
to
vote
and
it
should
subsequently
be
decided
that
women
should
not
be
entitled
to
seats
the
acts
of
the
present
general
conference
would
be
illegal
and
unconstitutional
while
claiming
personally
to
favor
women
s
admission
he
quoted
law
to
sustain
their
rejection
and
wished
the
question
to
be
submitted
to
a
vote
of
the
church
the
vote
of
the
church
as
shown
by
the
adoption
of
rev
neely
s
amendment
signifying
the
ministers
present
at
annual
conferences
the
vote
upon
this
amendment
which
excluded
women
from
seats
in
the
general
conference
submitting
their
eligibility
to
the
decision
of
ministers
of
the
annual
conferences
was
adopted
to
it
thus
requires
vote
of
the
members
present
and
voting
at
the
annual
conferences
this
vote
to
be
ratified
by
a
vote
of
the
general
conference
in
order
to
woman
s
acceptance
as
lay
delegate
to
such
general
conference
aside
from
the
fact
of
an
appeal
to
the
civil
law
for
the
exclusion
of
woman
thus
showing
the
close
union
of
church
and
state
one
other
important
point
must
be
noticed
in
the
declaration
that
the
church
should
be
consulted
in
regard
to
such
an
important
matter
that
body
was
defined
as
the
ministers
of
the
annual
conference
laymen
not
here
ranking
as
part
of
the
church
the
lay
delegates
unnarrowed
by
theological
studies
were
as
a
body
favorable
to
woman
s
admission
nor
did
they
refrain
from
criticising
the
clergy
declaring
that
the
episcopacy
did
not
interpret
the
law
of
the
church
this
power
resting
in
the
general
conference
but
one
more
favoring
vote
would
have
tied
the
question
samuel
hurst
dairy
and
food
commissioner
of
ohio
the
first
layman
to
gain
the
floor
defended
the
right
of
women
to
admission
he
alluded
to
the
opponents
of
the
women
as
old
he
criticized
the
bishop
s
address
the
episcopacy
does
not
interpret
the
law
of
the
church
but
the
general
conference
does
woman
does
not
come
here
as
a
person
demanding
admittance
but
she
comes
as
representative
of
the
lay
conference
the
word
laymen
was
interpreted
to
mean
all
members
of
the
church
not
represented
in
the
ministry
that
is
the
law
and
if
women
are
laymen
they
are
entitled
to
admission
the
southern
baptist
association
meeting
in
new
orleans
in
july
of
the
same
year
refused
to
admit
women
by
a
vote
of
to
the
church
as
of
old
is
still
strenuous
in
its
efforts
to
influence

an
amendment
to

pressed
by

recognizing
the
sectarian
idea
of

placing
marriage
and
divorce
under
control
of
the

by

while
priestly
views
upon
the
political
freedom
of

are
thrust
into
the
very
faces
of

the
following
portions
of
a
sermon
preached
at
the
cathedral
of
the
holy
cross
boston
february
by
the
rev
father
bodfish
were
printed
and
distributed
among
the
members
of
the
massachusetts
legislature
that
spring
by
the
opponents
of
woman
suffrage
not
that
i
would
have
woman
step
out
of
her
sphere
the
man
is
the
natural
protector
the
father
the
lawgiver
of
his
family
not
would
i
counsel
wives
to
usurp
the
places
of
their
husbands
at
the
polls
i
believe
this
to
be
one
of
the
errors
of
modern
times
to
try
to
unsex
woman
and
take
her
from
the
high
place
she
occupies
and
drag
her
into
the
arena
of
public
life
what
has
she
to
do
there
we
might
as
well
try
to
drag
down
the
angels
to
take
part
in
the
menial
affairs
of
this
world
as
to
take
woman
from
the
high
place
she
occupies
in
the
family
where
tis
her
privilege
and
duty
to
guide
to
counsel
and
to
lead
that
family
in
the
way
of
righteousness
it
is
but
offering
her
a
degradation
almighty
god
never
intended
it
the
charm
the
influence
of
woman
is
in
that
purity
that
comes
from
living
in
a
sphere
apart
from
us
god
forbid
that
we
should
ever
see
the
day
that
a
man
a
husband
or
a
father
is
to
find
his
will
opposed
and
thwarted
at
the
polls
by
his
daughter
or
his
wife
then
farewell
to
that
reverence
which
belongs
to
the
character
of
woman
she
puts
herself
on
an
equal
footing
with
man
when
she
steps
down
from
that
place
where
every
one
regards
her
with
reverence
and
becomes
unsexed
by
striving
to
make
laws
which
she
can
not
enforce
and
taking
upon
herself
duties
for
which
she
is
altogether
unfitted
decrees
of
various
characters
presenting
woman
as
a
being
of
different
natural
and
spiritual
rights
from
man
are
constantly
formulated
by
the
churches
the
plenary
council
of
baltimore
busied
itself
in
the
enactment
of
canons
directly
bearing
upon
marriage
and
divorce
the
sacramental
character
of
marriage
and
declaring
that
marriages
under
civil
rites
should
be
resented
by
the
whole
catholic
world
this
council
was
preceded
by
an
encyclical
from
the
pope
laying
out
its
plans
by
work
yet
leaving
it
within
the
power
of
the
diocesan
bishops
to
promulgate
its
canons
according
to
their
own
wisdom
consequently
not
until
three
years
later
were
those
upon
marriage
published
on
the
pacific
coast
at
which
time
the
archbishop
of
san
francisco
the
bishops
of
monterey
los
angeles
and
grass
valley
addressed
a
pastoral
letter
to
the
catholics
of
those
regions
condemning
civil
marriage
as
a
sin
and
sacrilege
illegal
and
a
horrible
it
was
farther
stated
that
marriage
unblessed
by
a
priest
subjected
the
parties
to
excommunication
at
the
still
later
catholic
congress
in
honor
of
the
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
catholic
hierarchy
in
america
divorces
were
affirmed
to
be
the
plague
of
civilization
a
discredit
to
the
government
a
degradation
of
the
female
sex
and
a
standing
menace
to
the
sanctity
of
the
marriage
bond
in
noting
these
canons
of
the
plenary
council
and
the
resolutions
of
the
catholic
congress
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
chief
secret
of
the
power
of
the
catholic
church
has
been
its
hold
upon
marriage
and
the
subordination
of
woman
in
this
relation
to
these
celibate
priests
nothing
connected
with
woman
is
sacred
celibacy
and
the
sacramental
nature
of
marriage
are
each
of
them
based
upon
the
theory
of
woman
s
created
inferiority
and
original
sin
priestly
power
over
marriage
and
the
confessional
through
which
means
it
is
able
to
wrest
all
family
and
state
secrets
to
its
own
use
are
powers
that
will
not
be
peaceably
relinquished
their
destruction
will
come
through
the
growing
intelligence
of
people
and
the
responsibility
of
political
these
will
insure
confidence
in
the
validity
of
civil
marriage
and
a
belief
in
the
personal
rights
of
individuals
to
woman
the
education
of
political
responsibility
is
most
essential
in
order
to
free
her
from
church
bonds
and
is
therefore
most
energetically
opposed
by
the
church
in
a
number
of
catholic
ladies
of
paris
formed
a
union
for
the
emancipation
of
woman
from
different
kinds
of
social
thraldom
their
first
attack
was
upon
the
priesthood
whom
they
declared
the
mortal
adversary
of
woman
s
advancement
affirming
that
every
woman
who
abets
the
abbés
is
an
enemy
of
her
this
open
rebellion
of
catholic
ladies
against
the
power
of
the
hierarchy
is
a
significant
sign
of
woman
s
advancing
freedom
all
canons
decrees
resolutions
and
laws
of
the
church
especially
bearing
upon
the
destinies
of
woman
are
promulgated
without
the
hearing
of
her
voice
either
in
confirmation
or
rejection
she
is
simply
legislated
for
as
a
slave
two
of
the
later
triennial
conclaves
of
the
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
energetically
debated
the
subject
of
divorce
not
however
arriving
at
sufficient
unanimity
of
opinion
for
the
enactment
of
a
canon
when
mazzini
the
italian
patriot
was
in
this
country
he
declared
the
destruction
of
the
priesthood
to
be
our
only
surety
for
continued
freedom
saying
they
will
be
found
as
in
italy
the
foes
of
mankind
and
if
the
united
states
expects
to
retain
even
its
political
liberties
it
must
get
rid
of
the
priesthood
as
italy
intends
to
do
frances
wright
that
scotch
woman
noted
the
dangerous
purpose
and
character
of
the
christian
party
in
politics
even
as
early
as
and
the
present
effort
of
this
body
now
organized
as
the
national
reform
association
with
its
adjunct
the
american
sabbath
union
officered
by
priests
and
influential
members
of
the
woman
s
christian
temperance
union
and
kindred
bodies
is
a
perpetual
menace
to
the
civil
and
religious
liberties
of
the
united
states
its
effort
for
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
which
shall
recognize
the
united
states
as
a
christian
nation
is
a
determined
endeavor
toward
the
union
of
church
and
state
and
its
success
in
such
attempt
will
be
the
immediate
destruction
of
both
civil
and
religious
liberty
that
such
a
party
now
openly
exists
its
intentions
no
secret
is
evidence
that
the
warnings
of
italian
patriot
and
the
scotch
free
thinker
were
not
without
assured
foundation
as
a
body
the
church
opposes
education
for
woman
and
all
the
liberalizing
tendencies
of
the
last
or
forty
years
which
have
opened
new
and
varied
industries
to
women
and
secured
to
wives
some
relief
from
their
general
serf
condition
bishop
littlejohn
of
the
episcopal
church
at
the
triennial
conclave
of
bishops
preached
as
his
triennial
charge
upon
the
church
and
the
family
presenting
the
general
church
idea
as
to
woman
s
inferiority
and
subordination
he
made
authoritative
use
of
the
words
sanctities
of
home
a
phrase
invented
by
the
clergy
as
a
method
of
holding
woman
in
bondage
directed
the
church
to
strictly
impose
her
doctrines
as
to
marriage
and
divorce
clash
as
they
may
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
and
the
laws
of
the
state
thus
emulating
the
catholic
doctrines
of
the
supremacy
of
the
church
he
declared
that
in
any
respect
to
change
the
relation
established
by
god
himself
between
husband
and
wife
was
rank
infidelity
no
matter
what
specious
disguise
such
change
might
assume
explicitly
declaring
the
authority
of
the
church
over
marriage
as
against
the
authority
of
the
state
protesting
against
omission
of
the
word
obey
from
the
marriage
service
and
the
control
of
the
wife
over
her
own
earnings
and
expenditures
saying
if
it
be
outside
the
province
of
the
states
to
treat
marriage
as
more
than
a
contract
between
a
man
and
a
woman
the
church
must
make
it
understood
as
it
is
not
that
it
is
inside
her
province
to
treat
it
as
a
thing
instituted
of
god
practically
we
have
reached
a
point
where
the
wife
may
cease
to
have
property
interests
in
common
with
her
husband
may
control
absolutely
her
own
means
of
living
and
determine
for
herself
the
scale
of
expenditures
that
will
suit
her
tastes
or
her
caprices
the
man
is
no
longer
the
head
of
the
household
the
husband
it
has
been
made
an
open
question
whether
the
man
or
his
wife
will
fulfill
that
function
and
a
community
of
interests
with
the
recognized
authority
of
the
husband
to
rule
the
wife
and
the
recognized
duty
of
the
wife
to
obey
that
authority
is
no
longer
deemed
expedient
or
this
rebellion
against
the
old
view
of
marriage
is
so
strong
that
in
many
cases
the
word
obey
is
omitted
from
the
marriage
service
even
among
christianized
indians
we
find
different
laws
governing
man
and
woman
in
the
governor
of
maine
paid
a
visit
to
the
governor
of
the
passamaquody
indians
at
a
time
when
a
large
council
was
in
progress
upon
the
croix
reservation
this
council
first
assembled
at
the
chapel
where
the
revised
whole
basis
of
government
of
the
posted
these
statutes
having
been
approved
by
bishop
healy
of
portland
are
also
looked
upon
as
canons
of
the
church
the
statutes
principally
affecting
women
are
third
no
woman
who
is
separated
from
her
husband
shall

sacrament
or
to
any
place
in

except
the
porch
in
summer
and
the
back
seat
in
winter
unless
by
the
consent
of
the
bishop
fourth
any
woman
who
admits
men
into
her
house
by
night
shall
be
treated
as
a
criminal
and
delivered
to
the
courts
fifth
any
woman
who
is
disobedient
to
her
husband
any
common
scold
or
drunkard
shall
not
be
permitted
to
enter
the
church
except
by
permission
of
the
priest
it
will
be
noted
that
these
statutes
forbid
the
sacrament
to
the
woman
who
is
separated
from
her
husband
not
even
permitting
her
an
accustomed
seat
in
church
she
must
remain
in
the
porch
during
the
summer
and
in
a
back
seat
during
the
winter
except
the
bishop
otherwise
permits
also
the
woman
not
rendering
obedience
to
her
husband
is
denied
permission
to
enter
the
church
except
under
priestly
permit
the
christian
theory
of
woman
s
inferiority
and
subordination
to
man
is
as
fully
endorsed
by
these
statutes
as
in
the
mediaeval
priestly
instruction
to
husbands
no
profession
as
constantly
appeals
to
the
lower
nature
as
the
priestly
the
emotions
rather
than
reason
are
constantly
invoked
ambition
love
of
power
hope
of
reward
fear
of
punishment
are
the
incentives
presented
and
in
no
instance
are
such
incentives
more
fully
made
use
of
than
for
purposes
of
sustaining
the
supremacy
of
man
over
woman
the
teaching
of
the
church
can
not
fail
to
impress
woman
with
the
feeling
that
if
she
expects
education
or
even
opportunity
of
full
entrance
into
business
she
must
not
heed
the
admonitions
of
the
priesthood
when
as
by
dix
she
is
contemptuously
forbidden
to
enter
the
professions
on
the
ground
that
god
designed
these
offices
alone
for
man
when
women
sought
university
honors
at
oxford
a
few
years
since
many
incredibly
foolish
letters
said
were
written
by
its
opponents
who
were
chiefly
clergymen
canon
liddon
s
influence
was
against
the

the
dean
of
norwich
referred
to
it
as
an
attempt
to
defeat
divine
providence
and
holy

it

but
ignorance
yet
according
to

rev
turnstall
craven
and
the
priesthood
of
the
present
day
in
common
with
the
earlier
church
woman
s
normal
condition
is
that
of
ignorance
and
education
is
the
prerogative
of
man
alone
and
yet
the
dangers
of
ignorance
have
by
no
means
been
fathomed
although
the
latest
investigations
show
the
close
relation
between
knowledge
and
life
that
as
intelligence
is
diffused
there
is
a
corresponding
increase
of
longevity
is
proven
the
most
uneducated
communities
showing
the
greatest
proportion
of
deaths
ignorance
and
the
death
rate
are
parts
of
the
same
question
education
and
length
of
life
are
proportionately
synonymous
statistics
gathered
in
england
wales
and
ireland
a
few
years
since
showed
the
percentage
of
infantile
deaths
to
be
much
greater
in
those
portions
where
the
mother
could
not
read
and
write
than
where
the
mother
had
sufficient
education
to
read
a
newspaper
and
write
her
own
name
in
districts
where
there
was
no
other
appreciable
difference
except
that
of
education
the
mortality
was
the
largest
in
the
most
ignorant
districts
in
deprecating
education
for
women
no
organized
body
in
the
world
has
so
clearly
proven
its
own
tyrannous
ignorance
as
has
the
priesthood
and
no
body
has
shown
itself
so
fully
the
enemy
of
mankind
church
teaching
and
centuries
of
repression
acting
through
the
laws
of
heredity
have
lessened
woman
s
physical
size
depressed
her
mental
action
subjugated
her
spirit
and
crushed
her
belief
in
her
right
to
herself
and
the
proper
training
of
her
own
children
the
church
in
its
opposition
to
woman
s
education
through
the
ages
has
literally
killed
off
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
with
much
greater
rapidity
than
war
pestilence
or
famine
more
than
the
children
born
into
the
world
have
soon
died
because
of
the
tyranny
and
ignorance
of
the
priesthood
the
potential
physical
energy
of
mankind
thus
destroyed
can
in
a
measure
be
estimated
but
no
one
can
fathom
the
infinitely
greater
loss
of
mental
and
moral
force
brought
about
through
condemnation
of
knowledge
to
woman
only
by
induction
can
it
even
be
surmised
lecky
points
out
the
loss
to
the
world
because
so
many
of
its
purest
characters
donned
the
garb
of
monk
or
nun
that
injury
was
immediately
perceptible
but
in
the
denial
of
education
and
freedom
to
woman
more
than
ninety
per
cent
of
the
moral
and
physical
energy
of
the
world
has
literally
been
suffocated
and
owing
to
ignorance
and
lack
of
independent
thought
this
loss
is
as
yet
scarcely
recognized
so
dense
the
pall
of
ignorance
still
overshadowing
the
world
that
even
woman
herself
does
not
yet
conjecture
the
injury
that
has
been
done
her
or
of
what
she
and
her
children
have
been
deprived
nor
has
the
world
yet
roused
to
a
full
consciousness
of
the
mischief
to
mankind
that
has
been
perpetrated
through
the
falsehood
and
ignorant
presumption
of
those
claiming
control
over
its
dearest
rights
and
interests
resistance
to
the
wrong
thus
done
the
world
has
been
less
possible
because
perpetrated
in
the
name
of
god
and
religion
it
has
caused
tens
of
thousands
of
women
to
doubt
their
equality
of
right
with
man
in
education
to
disbelieve
they
possess
the
same
authority
to
interpret
the
bible
or
present
its
doctrines
as
man
neither
having
been
deprived
of
education
do
they
believe
themselves
to
be
man
s
political
equal
or
that
they
possess
equal
rights
with
him
in
the
household
this
degradation
of
woman
s
moral
nature
is
the
most
direful
result
of
the
teaching
of
the
church
in
regard
to
her
a
loss
of
faith
in
one
s
own
self
disbelief
in
one
s
own
right
to
the
fullest
cultivation
of
one
s
own
powers
proceeds
from
a
debasement
of
the
moral
sentiments
are
acquired
through
that
cultivation
of
the
intellectual
faculties
which
has
been
denied
to
woman
rev
charles
little
of
the
syracuse
university
says
in
the
report
of
a
sermon
of
a
distinguished
theologian
which
appeared
not
long
ago
this
striking
passage
occurred
if
i
were
to
choose
between
christianity
as
a
life
and
christianity
as
a
dogma
i
would
choose
christianity
as
a
judging
from
its
treatment
of
woman
and
the
many
recent
trials
for
heresy
dogma
rather
than
life
is
the
general
spirit
of
the
churches
everywhere
it
is
dogma
that
has
wrecked
true
religion
it
is
dogma
that
has
crushed
humanity
it
is
dogma
that
has
created
two
codes
of
morals
that
has
inculcated
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
that
has
degraded
womanhood
that
has
represented
divinity
as
possessing
every
evil
attribute
from
all
these
incontrovertible
facts
in
church
and
state
we
see
that
both
religion
and
government
are
essentially
masculine
in
their
present
forms
and
development
all
the
evils
that
have
resulted
from
dignifying
one
sex
and
degrading
the
other
may
be
traced
to
one
central
error
a
belief
in
a
trinity
of
masculine
gods
in
one
from
which
the
feminine
element
is
wholly
eliminated
and
yet
in
the
scriptural
account
of
the
simultaneous
creation
of
man
and
woman
the
text
plainly
recognizes
the
feminine
as
well
as
the
masculine
element
in
the
godhead
and
declares
the
equality
of
the
sexes
in
goodness
wisdom
and
power
genesis
i
and
god
said
let
us
make
man
in
our
own
image
after
our
likeness
and
so
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
male
and
female
created
he
them
and
gave
them
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
in
nothing
has
the
ignorance
and
weakness
of
the
church
been
more
fully
shown
than
in
its
controversies
in
regard
to
the
creation
from
time
of
the
fathers
to
the
present
hour
despite
its
assertion
and
its
dogmas
the
church
has
ever
been
engaged
in
discussions
upon
the
garden
of
eden
the
serpent
woman
man
and
god
as
connected
in
one
inseparable
relation
amid
all
the
evils
attributed
to
woman
her
loss
of
paradise
introduction
of
sin
into
the
world
and
the
consequent
degradation
of
mankind
yet
eve
and
through
her
all
women
have
found
occasional
defenders
a
book
printed
in
amsterdam
in
a
series
of
eleven
reasons
threw
the
greater
culpability
upon
adam
saying
first
the
serpent
tempted
her
before
she
thought
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
that
not
well
understood
his
meaning
second
that
believing
that
god
had
not
given
such
prohibition
she
eat
the
fruit
third
sinning
through
ignorance
she
committed
a
less
heinous
crime
than
adam
fourth
that
eve
did
not
necessarily
mean
the
penalty
of
eternal
death
for
god
s
decree
only
imported
that
man
should
die
if
he
sinned
against
his
conscience
fifth
that
god
might
have
inflicted
death
on
eve
without
injustice
yet
he
resolved
so
great
is
his
mercy
toward
his
works
to
let
her
live
in
that
she
had
not
sinned
maliciously
sixth
that
being
exempted
from
the
punishment
contained
in
god
s
decree
she
might
retain
all
the
prerogatives
of
her
sex
except
those
that
were
not
incidental
with
the
infirmities
to
which
god
condemned
her
seventh
that
she
retained
in
particulars
the
prerogative
of
bringing
forth
children
who
had
a
right
to
eternal
happiness
on
condition
of
obeying
the
new
adam
eighth
that
as
mankind
was
to
proceed
from
adam
and
eve
adam
was
preserved
alive
only
because
his
preservation
was
necessary
for
the
procreation
of
children
ninth
that
it
was
by
accident
therefore
that
the
sentence
of
death
was
not
executed
on
him
but
that
otherwise
he
was
more
justly
punished
than
his
wife
tenth
that
she
was
not
driven
out
from
paradise
as
he
was
but
was
only
obliged
to
leave
it
to
find
out
adam
in
the
earth
and
that
it
was
with
full
privilege
of
returning
thither
again
eleventh
that
the
children
of
adam
and
eve
were
subject
to
eternal
damnation
not
as
proceeding
from
eve
but
as
proceeding
from
adam
in
but
three
hundred
years
since
an
inquiry
set
on
foot
as
to
the
language
of
paradise
resulted
in
the
statement
that
god
spoke
danish
adam
swedish
and
the
serpent
french
eve
doubtless
was
conceded
to
have
spoken
all
three
languages
as
she
conversed
with
god
with
adam
and
with
the
serpent
hieronymus
a
father
of
the
church
credited
eve
with
possessing
a
much
finer
constitution
than
adam
and
in
that
respect
as
superior
to
him
thus
during
the
ages
the
church
through
its
fathers
and
its
priests
has
devoted
itself
to
a
discussion
of
the
most
trivial
questions
concerning
woman
as
well
as
to
the
formation
of
most
oppressive
canons
against
her
and
although
as
shown
she
has
found
an
occasional
defender
and
even
claimants
for
her
superiority
upon
certain
points
yet
such
discussions
have
had
no
effect
upon
the
general
view
in
which
the
church
has
presented
her
as
one
accursed
of
god
and
man
present
the
most
important
struggle
in
the
history
of
the
church
is
that
of
woman
for
liberty
of
thought
and
the
right
to
give
that
thought
to
the
world
as
a
spiritual
force
the
church
appealed
to
barbaric
conception
when
it
declared
woman
to
have
been
made
for
man
first
in
sin
and
commanded
to
be
under
obedience
holding
as
its
chief
tenet
a
belief
in
the
inherent
wickedness
of
woman
the
originator
of
sin
as
its
sequence
the
sacrifice
of
a
god
becoming
necessary
the
church
has
treated
her
as
alone
under
a
curse
for
whose
enforcement
it
declared
itself
the
divine
instrument
woman
s
degradation
under
it
dating
back
to
its
earliest
history
while
the
nineteenth
century
still
shows
religious
despotism
to
have
its
stronghold
in
the
theory
of
woman
s
inferiority
to
man
the
church
has
ever
invoked
the
old
covenant
as
authority
while
it
also
asserts
this
covenant
was
done
away
with
at
the
advent
of
the
new
dispensation
paul
whose
character
as
persecutor
was
not
changed
when
he
veered
from
judaism
to
christianity
gave
to
the
church
a
lever
long
enough
to
reach
down
through
eighteen
centuries
in
opposition
to
woman
s
equality
with
man
through
this
lengthy
period
his
teaching
has
united
the
christian
world
in
opposition
to
her
right
of
private
judgment
and
personal
freedom
each
great
division
of
christianity
alike
proclaims
the
supreme
sinfulness
of
woman
in
working
for
the
elevation
of
her
sex
in
this
work
she
has
been
left
outside
of
religious
sympathy
outside
of
political
protection
yet
in
the
interest
of
justice
she
claims
the
right
to
tear
down
the
barriers
of
advancing
civilization
and
to
rend
asunder
all
beliefs
that
men
hold
most
sacred
freedom
for
woman
underlies
all
the
great
questions
of
the
age
she
must
no
longer
be
the
scapegoat
of
humanity
upon
whose
devoted
head
the
sins
of
all
people
are
made
to
rest
woman
s
increasing
freedom
within
the
last
hundred
years
is
not
due
to
the
church
but
to
the
to
education
to
and
other
forms
of
advancing
civilization
the
fashions
of
the
christian
world
have
changed
but
not
its
innermost
belief
the
power
of
the
pulpit
built
up
by
a
claim
of
divine
authority
with
the
priest
as
an
immediate
representative
of
god
has
been
reacting
upon
the
priesthood
itself
and
now
while
vainly
struggling
for
light
this
order
finds
itself
bound
by
chains
of
its
own
creating
today
the
priesthood
is
hampered
by
creeds
and
dogmas
centuries
old
yet
so
fully
outside
of
practical
life
that
the
church
has
become
the
great
materialistic
force
of
the
century
its
ideas
of
a
god
its
teachings
of
a
future
life
all
falling
within
the
realm
of
the
physical
senses
the
incorporeal
and
spiritual
are
lost
in
the
grossest
forms
of
matter
although
a
body
professing
to
inculcate
pure
spiritual
truths
the
church
teaches
the
grossest
form
of
materialism
it
asserts
principles
contradictory
to
natural
laws
it
presents
chaos
as
the
normal
condition
of
the
infinite
it
bids
people
live
under
faith
outside
of
evidence
and
in
thus
doing
is
guilty
of
immeasurable
evils
to
mankind
a
bark
without
compass
it
steers
upon
a
sea
of
night
no
star
illumining
the
darkness
the
control
and
guidance
by
humanity
of
the
psychic
part
of
being
generally
spoken
of
as
supernatural
although
the
truest
to
nature
has
become
nearly
lost
through
the
materialization
of
spiritual
truth
by
the
church
the
worst
form
of
idolatry
christianity
was
a
stern
reality
to
the
men
of
the
early
and
middle
ages
who
believing
themselves
to
have
been
created
nearer
to
god
than
woman
also
believed
themselves
to
have
lost
earthly
immortality
through
her
permeated
with
this
idea
it
is
not
strange
that
men
through
many
hundred
years
taught
that
woman
was
especially
under
control
of
the
evil
one
the
devil
was
an
objective
form
to
the
clergy
and
people
alike
nor
under
such
belief
is
it
strange
that
priests
should
warn
their
flocks
from
the
pulpit
against
the
wiles
of
woman
thus
degrading
her
and
teaching
men
to
hold
her
in
that
contempt
whose
influence
is
felt
today
the
result
of
this
teaching
has
been
deplorable
to
humanity
men
equally
with
women
having
sunk
under
this
degradation
of
of
the
race
the
most
stupendous
system
of
organized
robbery
known
has
been
that
of
the
church
towards
woman
a
robbery
that
has
not
only
taken
her
but
all
rights
of
person
the
fruits
of
her
own
industry
her
opportunities
of
education
the
exercise
of
her
own
judgment
her
own
conscience
her
own
will
the
unfortunate
peculiarity
of
the
history
of
man
according
to
buckle
is
that
although
its
separate
parts
have
been
examined
with
considerable
ability
hardly
any
one
has
attempted
to
outline
them
into
a
whole
and
ascertain
the
way
they
are
connected
with
each
other
while
this
statement
is
virtually
true
as
regards
the
general
history
of
mankind
it
is
most
particularly
so
in
reference
to
the
position
of
woman
in
its
bearings
upon
race
development
a
thorough
investigation
of
her
connection
with
our
present
form
of
civilization
or
even
with
that
of
the
past
as
compared
with
each
other
or
as
influencing
the
whole
has
never
yet
been
authoritatively
undertaken
this
failure
has
not
been
so
largely
due
to
willful
neglect
as
to
incapacity
upon
the
part
of
man
to
judge
truly
of
this
relation
woman
herself
must
judge
of
woman
the
most
remote
feminine
personality
is
not
less
incomprehensible
to
man
than
the
woman
of
today
he
now
as
little
understands
the
finer
qualities
of
her
soul
or
her
high
intuitive
reasoning
faculties
as
in
the
past
reason
is
divided
into
two
parts
theoretical
and
practical
the
former
appertains
to
man
the
latter
composed
of
those
intuitive
faculties
which
do
not
need
a
long
process
of
ratiocination
for
their
work
inhere
in
woman
although
the
course
of
history
has
given
many
glimpses
of
her
superiority
and
the
past
few
decades
have
shown
in
every
land
a
new
awakening
of
woman
to
a
recognition
of
her
own
powers
man
as
man
is
still
as
obtuse
as
of
yore
he
is
yet
under
the
darkness
of
the
patriarchate
failing
to
recognize
woman
as
a
component
part
of
humanity
whose
power
of
development
and
influence
upon
civilization
are
at
least
the
equal
of
his
own
he
yet
fails
to
see
in
her
a
factor
of
life
whose
influence
for
good
or
for
evil
has
ever
been
in
direct
ratio
with
her
freedom
he
does
not
yet
discern
her
equal
right
with
himself
to
impress
her
own
opinions
upon
the
world
he
still
interprets
governments
and
religions
as
requiring
from
her
an
unquestioning
obedience
to
laws
she
has
no
share
in
making
and
that
place
her
as
an
inferior
in
every
relation
of
life
ralph
waldo
emerson
with
keen
insight
into
the
fallibility
of
declared
that
good
men
must
not
obey
the
laws
too
woman
is
showing
her
innate
wisdom
in
daring
to
question
the
infallibility
of
man
his
laws
and
his
interpretation
of
her
place
in
creation
she
is
not
obeying
too
well
and
yet
man
fails
to
analyze
her
motives
in
this
defection
the
church
and
the
state
have
long
done
man
s
thinking
for
him
the
ideas
of
the
few
whose
aim
is
power
have
been
impressed
upon
the
many
individualism
is
still
characterized
as
the
essence
of
evil
as
heretical
the
state
condemns
both
as
a
crime
against
itself
the
church
as
a
sin
against
heaven
both
church
and
state
claiming
to
be
of
divine
origin
have
assumed
divine
right
of
man
over
woman
while
church
and
state
have
thought
for
man
man
has
assumed
the
right
to
think
for
woman
as
man
under
fear
of
eternal
damnation
surrendered
to
the
irresponsible
power
of
church
and
state
so
woman
yielded
to
that
power
which
closed
every
external
avenue
of
knowledge
to
her
under
pretext
of
her
sinfulness
of
the
human
race
within
the
period
covered
by
modern
civilization
has
compelled
the
other
to
think
their
thoughts
and
live
lives
according
to
their
commands
this
has
been
the
chief
effort
of
governments
and
religion
the
most
formidable
general
evil
under
which
woman
has
suffered
during
the
christian
ages
has
been
that
of
protection
a
of
her
ability
to
care
for
herself
rendering
watchful
guardianship
over
her
a
recognized
part
of
man
s
law
not
alone
to
prevent
her
sinking
into
depths
of
vice
but
to
also
prevent
her
entire
subversion
of
government
and
religion
buckle
and
other
writers
have
recognized
the
protective
spirit
as
the
greatest
enemy
to
civilization
its
influence
causing
the
few
to
establish
themselves
as
guardians
of
the
many
in
all
affairs
of
life
the
american
revolution
in
proclaiming
the
rights
of
humanity
struck
a
blow
at
the
protective
system
this
system
has
ever
based
itself
upon
a
declaration
of
the
supreme
rights
of
a
god
and
certain
rights
as
pertaining
to
certain
classes
of
men
by
virtue
of
authority
from
that
god
the
defense
of
such
authority
has
ever
been
the
chief
business
of
church
and
state
and
thus
religions
and
governments
have
neither
found
time
nor
inclination
to
uphold
the
rights
of
humanity
under
the
christian
system
woman
as
the
most
rebellious
against
god
in
having
eaten
a
forbidden
fruit
has
found
herself
condemned
through
the
centuries
to
untold
oppression
in
order
that
the
rights
of
god
might
be
maintained
yet
while
constantly
teaching
that
woman
brought
sin
into
the
world
the
church
ever
forgets
its
own
corollary
that
if
she
brought
sin
she
also
brought
god
into
the
world
thus
throwing
ineffable
splendor
over
mankind
the
whole
theory
regarding
woman
under
christianity
has
been
based
upon
the
conception
that
she
had
no
right
to
live
for
herself
alone
her
duty
to
others
has
continuously
been
placed
before
her
and
her
training
has
ever
been
that
of
taught
from
the
pulpit
and
legislative
halls
that
she
was
created
for
another
that
her
position
must
always
be
secondary
even
to
her
children
her
right
to
life
has
been
admitted
only
in
so
far
as
its
reacting
effect
upon
another
could
be
predicated
that
she
was
first
created
for
herself
as
an
independent
being
to
whom
all
the
opportunities
of
the
world
should
be
open
because
of
herself
has
not
entered
the
thought
of
the
church
has
not
yet
become
one
of
the
conceptions
of
law
is
not
yet
the
foundation
of
the
family
but
woman
is
learning
for
herself
that
not
but
is
her
first
duty
in
life
and
this
not
primarily
for
the
sake
of
others
but
that
she
may
become
fully
herself
a
perfectly
rounded
being
from
every
point
of
view
her
duty
to
others
being
a
secondary
consideration
arising
from
those
relations
in
life
where
she
finds
herself
placed
at
birth
or
those
which
later
she
voluntarily
assumes
but
these
duties
are
not
different
in
point
of
obligation
no
more
imperative
upon
her
than
are
similar
duties
upon
man
the
political
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
individual
although
but
partially
recognized
even
in
the
united
states
has
been
most
efficacious
in
destroying
that
protective
spirit
which
has
so
greatly
interfered
with
the
progress
of
humanity
this
spirit
yet
retains
its
greatest
influence
in
the
family
where
it
places
a
boundary
between
husband
and
wife
of
all
circumstances
biasing
the
judgment
and
restricting
the
sympathies
none
have
shown
themselves
more
powerful
than
physical
differences
whether
of
race
color
or
sex
when
those
differences
are
not
alone
believed
to
be
a
mark
of
inferiority
but
to
have
been
especially
created
for
the
pleasure
and
peculiar
service
of
another
the
elements
of
irresponsible
tyranny
upon
one
side
and
irremediable
slavery
upon
the
other
are
already
organized
if
in
addition
that
inferior
is
regarded
as
under
an
especial
curse
for
extraordinary
sin
as
the
church
has
ever
inculcated
in
reference
to
women
and
when
as
in
the
case
of
woman
and
man
an
entire
separation
of
interests
hopes
feelings
and
passions
is
impossible
we
have
reached
the
extreme
of
injustice
and
misery
under
the
protective
system
consequently
no
other
form
of
protection
has
possessed
so
many
elements
of
absolute
injustice
as
that
of
man
over
woman
swedenborg
taught
and
experience
declares
that
morality
can
not
exist
except
under
conditions
of
freedom
hence
we
find
much
that
has
been
called
morality
is
the
effect
of
dependence
and
lessened
and
has
really
been
immorality
and
degradation
while
in
every
age
the
virtues
of
have
been
pointed
to
as
evidence
of
the
highest
morality
we
find
those
women
in
whom
it
has
been
most
apparent
have
been
those
doing
least
justice
where
justice
first
themselves
justice
as
the
foundation
of
the
highest
law
is
a
primal
requirement
of
the
individual
to
the
self
it
is
none
the
less
a
serious
impeachment
of
the
idea
that
the
doctrine
of
protection
and
the
duty
of
woman
s
were
taught
under
the
theory
of
divine
authority
no
faith
was
more
profound
none
could
be
more
logical
if
resting
on
a
true
foundation
than
the
church
theory
regarding
woman
life
assumed
a
sterner
reality
to
men
who
believed
themselves
in
point
of
purity
and
priority
nearer
their
creator
than
woman
thereafter
she
was
to
be
protected
from
herself
the
church
and
man
cheerfully
assuming
this
duty
under
the
protective
spirit
it
is
not
so
very
long
since
men
sold
themselves
and
their
families
to
some
other
man
in
power
either
lay
or
religious
under
promise
of
protection
binding
themselves
to
obey
the
mandates
of
such
lord
evermore
the
church
protected
and
directed
the
thought
of
the
world
to
think
for
one
s
self
is
not
even
now
the
tendency
of
mankind
the
few
who
dare
do
so
at
great
peril
it
will
require
another
hundred
years
of
personal
and
political
freedom
for
men
to
appreciate
what
liberty
really
them
to
possess
confidence
in
their
own
judgment
upon
religious
the
man
of
humble
station
to
fully
believe
in
himself
and
in
his
own
opinions
when
opposed
to
the
authority
of
church
or
state
women
of
the
present
century
whose
struggle
for
equal
opportunity
of
education
with
men
for
a
chance
to
enter
the
liberal
professions
for
a
fair
share
of
the
world
of
work
for
equal
pay
in
that
work
for
all
demands
of
equality
which
make
the
present
a
noted
age
in
the
world
s
history
have
met
their
greatest
opposition
from
this
protective
spirit
no
less
than
during
the
darkest
period
of
its
history
does
the
church
still
maintain
the
theory
that
education
and
public
life
are
not
fitting
for
for
herself
and
injurious
to
the
community
during
the
christian
ages
the
church
has
not
alone
shown
cruelty
and
contempt
for
woman
but
has
exhibited
an
impious
and
insolent
disregard
of
her
most
common
rights
of
humanity
it
has
robbed
her
of
responsibility
putting
man
in
place
of
god
it
has
forbidden
her
the
offices
of
the
church
and
at
times
an
entrance
within
its
doors
it
has
denied
her
independent
thought
declaring
her
a
secondary
creation
for
man
s
use
to
whom
alone
it
has
made
her
responsible
it
has
anathematized
her
sex
teaching
her
to
feel
shame
for
the
very
fact
of
her
being
it
has
not
been
content
with
proclaiming
a
curse
upon
her
creative
attributes
but
has
thrust
the
sorrows
and
expiations
of
man
s
curse
upon
her
and
in
doing
these
things
the
church
has
wrought
her
own
ruin
a
religious
revolution
of
the
most
radical
kind
has
even
now
assumed
such
proportions
as
to
nearly
destroy
the
basic
creeds
of
various
sects
and
undermine
the
whole
fabric
of
christendom
it
everywhere
exists
although
neither
the
world
nor
the
church
seem
to
realize
the
magnitude
of
its
proportions
as
a
legitimate
result
of
two
opposing
forces
a
crisis
in
the
life
of
the
church
is
at
hand
nay
even
upon
it
while
we
see
it
making
organized
effort
for
extension
of
power
and
entire
control
of
the
state
we
also
find
great
increase
of
radical
thought
and
development
of
individual
conscience
and
individual
judgment
with
thought
no
longer
bound
by
fear
of
everlasting
punishment
mankind
will
cease
to
believe
unproved
assertions
simply
because
made
by
a
class
of
men
under
assumed
authority
from
god
reason
will
be
used
mankind
will
seek
for
truth
come
whence
it
may
lead
where
it
will
and
with
our
own
lucretia
mott
will
accept
truth
for
authority
and
not
authority
for
in
knocking
at
the
door
of
political
rights
woman
is
severing
the
last
link
between
church
and
state
the
church
must
lose
that
power
it
has
wielded
with
changing
force
since
the
days
of
constantine
ever
to
the
injury
of
freedom
and
the
world
the
immeasurable
injustice
of
woman
and
her
sufferings
under
christianity
her
intellectual
moral
and
spiritual
servitude
will
never
be
understood
until
life
with
its
sorrows
shall
be
opened
to
our
vision
in
a
sphere
more
defined
than
the
present
one
the
superstitions
of
the
church
the
miseries
of
woman
her
woes
tortures
burnings
rackings
and
all
the
brutalities
she
has
endured
in
the
church
the
state
the
family
under
the
sanction
of
christianity
would
be
incredible
had
we
not
the
most
undeniable
evidence
of
their
existence
not
alone
in
the
past
but
as
shown
by
the
teachings
laws
and
customs
of
the
present
time
she
has
suffered
under
a
theology
which
extended
its
rule
not
only
to
her
civil
and
political
relations
but
to
her
most
significant
domestic
and
personal
concerns
regulating
the
commerce
of
husband
and
wife
of
parent
and
child
of
master
and
servant
even
prescribing
her
diet
and
dress
her
education
and
her
edmund
noble
speaks
in
like
manner
of
the
ancient
russians
under
the
tyrannical
provisions
of
the
greek
church
saying
clearly
such
a
system
of
theocratic
supervision
and
direction
as
this
is
compatible
only
with
the
lowest
possible
spiritual
condition
of
the
subject
or
the
lowest
possible
conception
of
possessing
no
proof
of
its
existence
the
church
has
ever
fostered
unintelligent
belief
to
doubt
her
unverified
assertion
has
even
been
declared
an
unpardonable
sin
the
supreme
effort
of
the
church
being
maintenance
of
power
it
is
but
recently
that
woman
has
been
allowed
to
read
history
for
herself
or
having
read
it
dared
to
draw
her
own
conclusion
from
its
premises
ignorance
and
falsehood
created
a
sentiment
in
accord
with
themselves
crushing
all
her
aspirations
in
the
family
man
still
decides
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
wife
as
of
old
as
legislator
and
judge
he
still
makes
and
executes
class
laws
in
the
church
he
yet
arrogates
to
himself
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
still
claims
to
be
an
exponent
of
the
divine
will
that
grandest
lesson
of
the
reformation
the
right
of
private
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
not
yet
having
been
conceded
to
woman
the
premises
upon
which
the
church
is
based
being
radically
false
and
this
most
especially
in
everything
related
to
woman
trained
from
infancy
by
the
church
to
a
belief
in
woman
s
inferiority
and
incapacity
for
men
of
the
highest
station
have
not
hesitated
to
organize
societies
in
opposition
to
her
just
demands
as
early
as
an
s
franchise
association
was
formed
in
london
under
the
name
of
association
for
protecting
the
franchise
from
the
encroachment
of

formerly

hon
claflin
and
leathers
correspondent
of
the
york
since
this
period
a
number
of
women
distinguished
as
the
wives
of
have
petitioned
legislative
bodies
for
protection
against
freedom
for
themselves
and
all
others
of
their
sex
in
asking
that
legislatures
shall
not
recognize
woman
s
right
the
deepest
depth
of
degradation
is
reached
when
the
slave
not
only
declares
against
his
own
freedom
but
strives
to
tighten
the
bonds
of
fellow
slaves
and
the
most
cruel
wrong
resulting
from
such
slavery
is
the
destruction
of
in
the
enslaved
as
shown
by
the
course
of
these
women
petitioners
the
protective
theory
reached
its
lowest
depth
for
woman
by
an
attack
upon
her
already
vested
rights
of
the
ballot
in
the
former
territory
now
state
of
washington
on
the
pacific
coast
in
case
of
nevada
bloomer
a
woman
against
john
wood
and
others
to
have
the
women
of
that
territory
deprived
of
their
already
existing
right
of
suffrage
in
line
with
the
general
opposition
to
the
enfranchisement
of
woman
men
of
even
the
most
liberal
tendencies
declare
that
her
political
freedom
will
be
used
to
sustain
the
church
apparently
forgetting
that
man
alone
has
placed
the
church
in
power
and
that
man
alone
holds
it
in
power
and
proof
of
man
s
complicity
is
even
greater
than
this
despite
what
is
said
of
the
larger
church
membership
of
women
the
most
noted
modern
evangelist
moody
recently
declared
that
he
found
men
tenfold
aye
an
more
receptive
of
his
preaching
than
women
while
speaking
in
farwell
hall
chicago
he
said
for
fifteen
years
i
have
preached
to
women
in
the
afternoon
and
very
often
as
near
as
i
could
have
preached
the
same
sermon
to
men
at
night
and
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
have
had
five
times
more
result
in
preaching
to
men
than
to
this
as
to
woman
s
susceptibility
to
church
teaching
brought
up
by
the
enemies
of
her
freedom
possesses
no
more
real
value
than
the
argument
sometimes
presented
in
opposition
to
woman
s
admission
into
active
politics
that
is
her
emotional
temperament
to
one
who
has
been
present
at
four
great
presidential
nominating
conventions
and
several
large
state
conventions
knowledge
upon
this
point
is
practical
when
one
has
seen
a
cordon
of
police
enforced
by
the
mayor
upon
the
platform
protecting
the
officers
of
such
convention
while
its
members
standing
upon
seats
stamped
shouted
gesticulated
threatened
with
revolvers
acting
more
like
uncaged
wild
beasts
than
like
men
when
one
has
witnessed
the
wildest
enthusiasm
at
the
mention
of
a
name
the
waving
of
flags
of
hats
of
handkerchiefs
the
shaking
of
umbrellas
chairs
canes
with
violent
stamping
amid
a
hubbub
of
indistinguishable
voices
all
shouting
screaming
so
loud
that
people
for
blocks
away
are
roused
from
slumber
in
affright
of
a
fire
or
the
approach
of
an
ungovernable
mob
such
objections
to
woman
s
freedom
as
her
emotions
fall
to
their
lowest
value
in
church
and
in
state
man
has
exhibited
the
wildest
passions
the
most
ungovernable
shown
himself
less
controlled
by
reason
than
possible
for
woman
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
judaism
and
its
offspring
christianity
show
the
results
of
the
patriarchate
in
some
of
its
most
degenerate
forms
industrial
servitude
educational
restrictions
legal
thraldom
political
slavery
false
religious
teachings
are
but
a
portion
of
the
evils
existing
under
its
most
enlightened
forms
and
equally
with
the
more
pronounced
polygamy
and
infanticide
they
show
a
total
perversion
of
moral
ideas
woman
dearly
pays
for
the
rights
she
has
secured
labor
opposes
in
less
pay
for
the
same
work
literature
at
first
welcoming
her
only
through
the
cook
book
next
compelled
her
to
conceal
her
sex
under
a
male
pseudonym
in
order
that
her
writings
might
be
received
with
the
same
respect
as
those
of
man
art
has
given
her
similar
experiences
and
while
today
admitting
her
to
the
same
advantage
of
study
with
man
yet
compels
her
to
pay
twice
the
price
for
the
same
instructions
the
careful
student
of
history
will
discover
that
christianity
has
been
of
very
little
value
in
advancing
civilization
but
has
done
a
great
deal
toward
retarding
it
civilization
a
recognition
of
the
rights
of
others
at
every
point
of
contact
has
been
carried
forward
by
means
of
rebellion
against
church
teaching
and
church
authority
the
experience
of
science
is
familiar
to
all
even
school
children
quoting

and
faust
what
are
called
reformations
in
religion
the
work
of
huss
of
luther
of
the
waldenses
the
huguenots
are
equally
familiar
instances
to
the
youngest
student
of
rebellion
against
the
church
these
and
a
myriad
of
others
known
to
the
historian
have
all
been
brought
about
by
refusal
to
accept
the
authority
of
the
church
as
final
the
peasant
war
in
france
the
struggles
of
wat
tyler
and

the
french
and
the
american
revolutions
looking
toward
equality
of

and
a
thousand
minor
forms
of

progress
have
all
been
opposed
by
the
church
as
rebellions
against
its
teachings
yet
all
have
been
marked
steps
in
civilization
the
church
and
civilization
are
antipodal
one

the

one
means

free
men
the
uprising
of
the
women
of
all
peoples
in
assertion
of
their
common
humanity
with

is
exemplification
of
that
fact
recognized
in

that

which
persons
are

its
absolutely
certain
ultimate
effect
no
matter
how
long
delayed
in
rebellion
a
time
comes
in
the
history
of
souls
as
of
nations
when
forbearance
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
and
life
is
only
to
be
retained
through
defiance
of
and
rebellion
against
existing
customs
the
soul
must
assert
its
own
supremacy
or
die
it
is
not
one
woman
or
the
women
of
one
nation
that
have
thus
suddenly
shown
desire
to
rule
act
for

alone
a
strange
identity
of

pervades
all

all
of

north
and
south
america
the
vast
continents
of
the
southern

and
the

thereof
and
even
barbaric
africa
all
evince
proof
of
the
wide
psychic
which
seething
through
women
s
souls
is
overthrowing
the
civilizations
built
upon
the
force
principles
of
the
patriarchate
and
will
soon
reinstate
the
reign
of
truth
and
justice
during
those
long
ages
of
priestly
intolerance
of
domestic
and
governmental
tyranny
in
which
woman
seemed
to
accept
the
authority
of
the
priest
as
that
of
god
there
still
existed
a
consciousness
hardly
perceptible
to
herself
that
she
was
an
independent
being
to
whom
by
virtue
of
her
humanity
all
opportunities
in
life
belonged
from
century
to
century
mothers
transmitted
this
scarcely
developed
perception
to
daughters
until
suddenly
within
the
past
fifty
years
these
dominant
ideas
woke
to
thought
and
the
women
of
all
nations
began
to
proclaim
their
same
right
to
as
that
claimed
by
man
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
the
church
without
noticing
its
connection
with
the
great
systems
of
the
world
during
its
course
of
life
the
history
of
christendom
is
the
history
of
the
myriad
institutions
which
have
arisen
through
its
teachings
or
that
have
been
sustained
by
its
approval
the
world
has
not
grown
wise
under
it
except
with
a
wisdom
that
is
leading
the
purest
humanitarian
thought
in
a
direction
contrary
to
its
footsteps
slavery
and
prostitution
persecutions
for
heresy
the
inquisition
with
its
six
hundred
modes
of
torture
the
destruction
of

the
oppression
of

the
systematized
betrayal
of
confiding
innocence
the

they

offspring
of
church
and
state
science
now
declares
crime
to
be
a
disease
but
it
has
not
yet
discovered
the
primal
cause
of
this
disease
it
is
an
inheritance
from
centuries
of
legalized
crime
against
woman
of
which
the
church
in
its
teachings
is
prime
factor
woman
will
gain
nothing
by
a
compromising
attitude
toward
the
church
by
attempt
to
excuse
its
great
wrong
toward
her
sex
or
by
palliation
of
its
motives
on
the
contrary
a
stern
reference
to
facts
keeping
the
face
of
the
world
turned
toward
its
past
teachings
its
present
attitude
is
her
duty
wrongs
of
omission
equal
in
magnitude
those
of
commission
advance
for
woman
is
too
well
established
woman
has
had
too
much
experience
has
borne
too
much
ridicule
misrepresentation
and
abuse
to
now
hesitate
in
an
attack
upon
the
stronghold
of
her
church
she
possesses
too
full
knowledge
of
its
subtle
touch
upon
civil
law
to
dare
leave
it
alone
it
has
become
one
of
woman
s
first
duties
one
of
her
greatest
responsibilities
to
call
public
attention
to
its
false
doctrines
and
false
teachings
in
regard
to
the
origin
condition
and
subjection
of
woman
she
has
engaged
in
too
many
battles
weathered
too
many
storms
to
longer
hesitate
in
exposure
of
its
stupendous
crimes
toward
of
humanity
let
those
who
fear
hide
themselves
if
they
will
until
the
storm
is
past
let
those
who
dare
defiantly
rejoice
that
they
are
called
upon
to
bear
still
more
in
order
that
woman
may
be
free
a
brighter
day
is
to
come
for
the
world
a
day
when
the
intuitions
of
woman
s
soul
shall
be
accepted
as
part
of
humanity
s
spiritual
wealth
when
force
shall
step
backward
and
love
in
reality
rule
the
teachings
of
religion
and
may
woman
be
strong
in
the
ability
and
courage
necessary
to
bring
about
this
millennial
time
the
world
is
full
of
signs
of
the
near
approach
of
this
period
as
never
before
is
there
an
arousing
sense
of
something
deeper
holier
in
religion
than
the
christian
church
has
given
the
world
has
seemingly
awaited
the
advent
of
heroic
souls
who
once
again
should
dare
all
things
for
the
truth
the
woman
who
possesses
love
for
her
sex
for
the
world
for
truth
justice
and
right
will
not
hesitate
to
place
herself
upon
record
as
opposed
to
falsehood
no
matter
under
what
guise
of
age
or
holiness
it
appears
a
generation
has
passed
since
the
great
struggle
began
but
not
until
within
ten
years
has
woman
dared
attack
upon
the
veriest
stronghold
of
her
oppression
the
church
the
state
agent
and
slave
of
the
church
has
so
long
united
with
it
in
suppression
of
woman
s
intelligence
has
so
long
preached
of
power
to
man
alone
that
it
has
created
an
inherited
tendency
an
inborn
line
of
thought
toward
repression
bent
in
this
line
before
his
birth
man
still
unwittingly
thinks
of
woman
as
not
quite
his
equal
and
it
requires
a
new
creation
of
mind
to
change
his
thought
a
second
generation
has
arisen
in
whom
some
slight
inherited
tendencies
toward
recognition
of
a
woman
s
right
to
herself
are
seen
in
the
next
generation
this
line
of
inherited
thought
will
have
become
stronger
both
church
and
state
more
fully
recognizing
woman
s
inherent
right
to
share
in
all
the
opportunities
of
life
but
at
what
cost
to
all
who
have
taken
part
in
the
great
struggle
has
woman
no
wrongs
to
avenge
upon
the
church
as
i
look
backward
through
history
i
see
the
church
everywhere
stepping
upon
advancing
civilization
hurling
woman
from
the
plane
of
natural
rights
where
the
fact
of
her
humanity
had
placed
her
and
through
itself
and
its
control
over
the
state
in
the
doctrine
of
revealed
rights
everywhere
teaching
an
inferiority
of
sex
a
created
subordination
of
woman
to
man
making
her
very
existence
a
sin
holding
her
accountable
to
a
diverse
code
of
morals
from
man
declaring
her
possessed
of
fewer
rights
in
church
and
in
state
her
very
entrance
into
heaven
made
dependent
upon
some
man
to
come
as
mediator
between
her
and
the
saviour
it
has
preached
thus
crushing
her
personal
intellectual
and
spiritual
freedom
looking
forward
i
see
evidence
of
a
conflict
more
severe
than
any
yet
fought
by
reformation
or
science
a
conflict
that
will
shake
the
foundations
of
religious
belief
tear
into
fragments
and
scatter
to
the
winds
the
old
dogmas
upon
which
all
forms
of
christianity
are
based
it
will
not
be
the
conflict
of
man
with
man
upon
rites
and
systems
it
will
not
be
the
conflict
of
science
upon
church
theories
regarding
creation
and
eternity
it
will
not
be
the
light
of
biology
illuminating
the
hypothesis
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
but
it
will
be
the
rebellion
of
one
half
of
the
church
against
those
theological
dogmas
upon
which
the
very
existence
of
the
church
is
based
in
no
other
country
has
the
conflict
between
natural
and
revealed
rights
been
as
pronounced
as
in
the
united
states
and
in
this
country
where
the
conflict
first
began
we
shall
see
its
full
and
final
development
during
the
ages
no
rebellion
has
been
of
like
importance
with
that
of
woman
against
the
tyranny
of
church
and
state
none
has
had
its
far
reaching
effects
we
note
its
beginning
its
progress
will
overthrow
every
existing
form
of
these
institutions
its
end
will
be
a
regenerated
world
notes
chapter
one
the
first
state
of
primitive
man
must
have
been
the
mere
aggregation
the
right
of
the
mother
was
therefore
most
natural
upon
the
relationship
of
mother
and
child
the
remotest
conception
of
the
family
was
where
a
god
and
goddess
are
worshiped
together
they
are
not
husband
and
wife
but
mother
and
son
neither
does
the
god
take
but
the
mother
or
goddess
this
condition
dates
from
the
earliest
days
of
society
when
marriage
in
our
sense
of
the
word
was
unknown
and
when
kinship
and
inheritance
were
in
the
female
line
the
babylonian
ishtur
of
the
izdobar
legend
is
a
deity
of
this
robertson
in
ancient
th
on
open
in
a
country
where
she
is
the
head
of
the
family
where
she
decides
the
descent
and
inheritance
of
her
children
both
in
regard
to
property
and
place
in
society
in
such
a
community
she
certainly
can
not
be
the
servant
of
her
husband
but
at
least
must
be
his
equal
if
not
in
many
respects
his
times
and
origin
of
among
many
people
the
father
at
birth
of
a
child
especially
a
son
loses
his
name
and
takes
the
one
his
child
gets
also
see
thus
we
see
that
woman
s
liberty
did
not
begin
at
the
upper
but
at
the
lower
end
of
civilization
woman
in
those
remote
times
was
endowed
with
and
enjoyed
rights
that
are
denied
to
her
but
too
completely
in
the
higher
phase
of
civilization
this
subject
has
a
very
important
aspect
the
position
of
woman
to
man
the
place
she
holds
in
society
her
condition
in
regard
to
her
private
and
public
political
among
the
monogamous
classic
nations
of
antiquity
the
maternal
deity
was
worshiped
with
religious
we
find
the
mother
s
right
exclusively
together
with
a
history
of
new
alexander
of
of
the
united
states
vol
what
is
most
to
be
considered
in
this
respect
are
the
political
rights
which
women
in
time
of
the
matriarchate
shared
with
the
men
they
had
indeed
the
right
to
vote
in
public
assemblies
still
exercised
not
very
long
ago
among
the
basques
in
the
spanish
that
the
veddas
are
the
aborigines
of
ceylon
may
be
assumed
from
the
fact
that
the
highly
civilized
singalese
admit
them
to
be
of
noble
rank
we
find
in
some
instances
this
independence
of
the
maiden
in
regard
to
disposing
of
her
hand
or
selecting
a
husband
as
a
memento
of
the
time
of
the
matriarchate
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
the
of
woman
we
find
among
the
ancient
arabs
and
the
hindoos
among
the
latter
the
virgin
was
permitted
to
select
her
own
husband
if
her

did

it

that

discover
that
the

fatherhood
of

in

which
protestant
theologians
talk
so
much
has
been
balanced
in

as
in

without

most
hideous
immorality
in
these
restrictions
which
forbade
the
presence
even
of

or
sister
in

priest
s
house
says
it
is
somewhat
significant
that
when
in
france
the
rule
of
celibacy
was
completely
enforced
churchmen
should
find
it
necessary
to
revive
this
hideously
suggestive
restriction
which
denied
the
priest
the
society
of
his
mother
and
he
declared
it
to
be
the
highest
degree
of
wickedness
to
rise
from
a
woman

side
to
make
the
body
of
christ

was

the

night
with

to
the
great
indignation
of
the
people
and
obliged
to
flee
the
country
to
escape
condign
punishment
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
the
order
of
ideas
that
produced
that
passionate
horror
of
the
fair
sex
which
is
such
a
striking
characteristic
of
old
catholic
theology
celibacy
was
universally
conceded
as
the
highest
form
of
virtue
and
in
order
to
make
it
acceptable
theologians
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
their
eloquence
in
describing
the
iniquity
of
those
whose
charm
had
rendered
it
so
rare
hence
the
long
and
fiery
disquisitions
on
the
unparalleled
malignity
the
unconceivable
subtlety
the
frivolity
the
unfaithfulness
the
unconquerable
evil
propensities
of
woman
european
the
fathers
of
the
church
for
the
most
part
vie
with
each
other
in
their
depreciation
of
woman
and
denouncing
her
with
every
vile
epithet
held
it
a
degradation
for
a
saint
to
touch
even
his
aged
mother
with
his
hand
in
order
to
sustain
her
feeble
steps
for
it
declared
woman

through
inherent
impurity

the
romish
religion
teaches
that
if
you
omit
to
name
anything
in
confession
however
repugnant
or
revolting
to
purity
which
you
even
doubt
having

and
you
will
see
that
the
gravest
and
most
reliable
historians
have
everywhere
found
instances
of
iniquity
in
the
confessional
box
which
their
order
refused
to
trace
it
is
a
public
fact
which
no
learned
roman
catholic
has
ever
denied
that
auricular
confession
became
a
dogma
and
obligatory
practice
of
the
church
only
at
the
lateran
council
in
the
year
under
pope
innocent
iii
not
a
single
trace
of
auricular
confession
as
a
dogma
can
be
found
before
that
year
auricular
confession
originated
with
the
early
heretics
especially
with
marcius
bellarmin
speaks
of
it
as
something
to
be
practiced
but
let
us
hear
what
the
contemporary
writers
have
to
say
on
this
question
certain
women
were
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
heretic
marcius
to
confess
their
sins
to
him
but
as
he
was
smitten
with
their
beauty
and
they
loved
him
also
they
abandoned
themselves
to
sin
with
disraeli
who
is
most
excellent
authority
declared
the
early
english
edition
of
the
bible
contained
errors
which
were
constantly
introduced
and
passages
interpolated
for
sectarian
purposes
or
to
sustain
new
creeds
sometimes
indeed
they
were
added
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
all
scriptural
authority
by
the
use
of
texts
the
revisors
of
the
new
testament
found
errors
interpolations
additions
and
false
translations
in
the
king
james
or
common
version
cardinal
wolsey
complained
to
the
pope
that
both
the
secular
and
regular
priests
were
in
the
habit
of
committing
actions
for
which
if
not
in
orders
they
would
have
been
promptly
executed
the
claim
of
direct
inspiration
from
god
exists
equally
among
protestants
as
among
catholics
and
even
among
the
unitarians
who
deny
christ
s
divinity
a
notable
instance
of
this
kind
both
because
of
the
high
scientific
and
moral
character
of
the

place
in
the
pulpit
of
the
may
memorial
church
syracuse
december
as
reported
in
the
morning
standard
of
the
luther
declared
that
priests
believed
themselves
to
be
as
superior
to
the
laity
in
general
as
males
were
held
superior
to
females
the
legal
wife
of
a
priest
was
termed
an
unhallowed
thing
while
mistresses
and
concubines
were
known
as
the
hallowed
ones
the
honored
in
parts
of
france
especially
in
paris
the
latter
epithet
was
common
as
applied
to
a
priest

heloise
sacrificed
herself
on
account
of
the
impediments
the
church
threw
in
the
way
of
the
married

as
his
wife
he
would
lose
the
ascending
ladder
of

even
that
which
was
above
and
beyond
all
in

walter
mill
was
indicted
one
article
of
his
accusation
being
his
assertion
of
the
lawfulness
of
sacerdotal
marriage
he
was
condemned
to
the
stake
and
burned
an
old
doctrine
which
often
turns
up
again
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
seventeenth
century
it
prevailed
among
the
convents
of
france
and
spain
they
made
the
vilest
use
of
the
doctrine
that
christ
was
born
of
a
virgin
using
this
as
an
example
for
woman
to
be
they
must
kill
sin
by
being
more
humble
and
lost
to
all
sense
of
pride
through
sin
this
was
the
quietist
doctrine
introduced
by
a
spanish
priest
molinos
who
claimed
it
as
the
result
of
an
inner
light
or
illumination
he
declared
that
only
by
dint
of
sinning
can
sin
be
let
not
this
surprise
you
replied
the
abbot
my
sanctity
is
not
the
less
on
this
account
because
that
abides
in
the
soul
and
what
i
now
ask
of

is
only
a
sin

the
unmarried
state
of
the
clergy
was
in
itself
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
sexual
excess
the
enormously
numerous
clergy
became
a
perilous
plague
for
female
morality
in
town
and
village
the
peasants
endeavored
to
preserve
their
wives
and
daughters
from
clerical
seduction
by
accepting
no
pastor
who
did
not
bind
himself
to
take

there
were

belonging
to

development
of
men
in

are
sometimes
deceived
by
the
devil
that
they
marry
unrighteously
and
foredo
themselves
by
the
adulteries
in
which
they
continue
of
polity
civil
and
there
is
ground
for
the
assumption
that
the
canon
which
bound
all
the
active
members
of
the
church
to
perpetual
celibacy
and
thus
created
an
impenetrable
barrier
between
them
and
the
outer
world
was
one
of
the
efficient
methods
in
creating
and
sustaining
both
the
temporal
and
spiritual
power
on
the
romish
church
all
steps
are
necessary
to
make
up
the
ladder
the
vices
of
men
become
steps
in
the

one
by

as
they
are
remounted
the
virtues
of

are
steps
indeed
necessary
not
by
any
means
to
be
dispensed
with
yet
though
they
create
a
fair
atmosphere
and
a
happy
future
they
are
useless
if
they
stand
alone
the
whole
nature
of
man
must
be
used
wisely
by
the
one
who

to
enter

it
by
plunging
into
the
mysterious
and
glorious
depth
of
your

being
seek
it
by
testing
all

by
utilizing
the
senses
in

to
understand
the
growth
of

of

the

of

who
will
regret
his
departure
from

and
yet
the
world
does
move
and
the
experience
of
the

is
much
that
of
the
big
elephant
jumbo
who
in
opposing
his
vast
form
to
a
train
of
cars
met
his
death
at
the
engine
the
chili
mantas
and
skirts
of
white
flannel
are
worn
by
penitentes
or
women
who
have
committed
some
heinous
sin
and
thus
advertise
their
penitence
or
those
who
have
taken
some
holy
vow
to
get
a
measure
nearer
heaven
and
go
about
the
street
with
downcast
eyes
looking
at
nothing
and
recognizing
no
one
they
hover
about
the
churches
and
sit
for
hours
crouched
before
some
saint
or
crucifix
saying
prayers
and
atoning
for
their
sin
in
the
great
cathedral
at
santiago
and
in
the
smaller
churches
everywhere
these
penitentes
in
their
garments
are
always
to
be
seen
on
their
knees
or
posing
in
other
uncomfortable
postures
and
looking
for
all
the
world
like
statues
carved
in
marble
in
the
santiago
cathedral
they
cluster
in
large
groups
around
the
confessionals
waiting
to
receive
absolution
from
some
fat
and
burly
father
that
they
may
rid
their
bodies
of
the
mark
of
penitence
they
carry
and
their
souls
of
sin
some
of
them
make
vows
or
are
sentenced
by
their
confessors
to
wear
their
white
shrouds
for
a
certain
time
while
others
assume
them
voluntarily
until
they
have
assurance
from
their
priest
that
their
sin
is
atoned
for
ladies
of
the
highest
social
position
and
great
wealth
are
commonly
found
among
the
penitentes
as
well
as
young
girls
of
beauty
and
winning
grace
even
the
wives
of
merchants
and
bankers
wander
about
the
streets
with
all
but
their
eyes
covered
with
this
white
mantle
which
gives
notice
to
the
world
that
they
have
sinned
the
women
of
chili
are
as
pious
as
the
men
are
proud
and
this
method
of
securing
absolution
is
quite
fashionable
those
souls
that
can
not
be
purged
by
this
penitential
dress
retire
to
a
convent
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
called
the
convent
of
the
penitents
where
they
scourge
themselves
with
whips
mortify
the
flesh
with
sackcloth
sleep
in
ashes
and
upon
stone
floors
and
feed
themselves
on
mouldy
crusts
some
stay
longer
and
some
a
less
time
in
these
houses
of
correction
until
the
priests
by
whose
advice
they
go
there
give
them
absolution
but
it
is
seldom
that
the
inmates
are
men
they
are
usually
women
who
have
been
unfaithful
to
their
marriage
vows
or
girls
who
have
yielded
to
temptation
after
the
society
season
after
the

and
can
find
no
room
to
remain
for

have
been

great
to

washed

knights
was
supposed
to
prove
the
high

of

day
on
the
contrary
this
period
succeeded
in
destroying
the
little
respect
for
the
female
sex
which
existed
at
its
commencement
the

both
in

coarse

swarm
with

of

dissolution
of

was

that

preference
of

in

was

unknown
to

no

could
take

after
which
is
even
now
the
rule
of

the

of

baltimore
tend
to
the
establishment
of
similar

in

sixty
years
since
contained
a
list
of
relatives
commencing
with
grandfather
and
grandmother
whom
a
man
and
woman
might
not
marry
the
policy
of
the
church
was
to
persuade
mankind
that
the
cohabitation
of
a
man
and
woman
was
in
itself
unholy
and
that
nothing
but
a
religious
bond
or
sacrament
could
render
it
inoffensive
in
the
eyes
of
god
of
crime
in
i
this
law
held
good
in
protestant
england
until
within
the
last
decade
the
church
visited
its
penalties
upon
the
innocent
as
well
as
guilty
when
any
man
remained
under
excommunication
two
months
his
wife
and
children
were
interdicted
and
deprived
of
all
doctrines
of
the
church
but
baptism
and
repentance
in
church
in
england
until
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
women
were
refused
the
benefit
of
clergy
in
the
hands
of
such
able
politicians
it
marriage
soon
became
an
engine
of
great
importance
to
the
papal
scheme
of
an
universal
monarchy
over
christendom
the
innumerable
canonical
impediments
that
were
invented
and
occasionally
dispensed
with
by
the
holy
see
not
only
enriched
the
coffers
of
the
church
but
give
it
a
vast
ascendant
over
persons
of
all
denominations
whose
marriages
were
sanctioned
or
repudiated
their
issue
legitimated
or
bastardized
according
to
the
humor
or
interest
of
the
reigning

the

a

boc
bacchus
were
comparatively
free
from
the
rule
of
the
warrior
class
both
in
civil
and
military
point
of
view
and
thence
arises
our
of
if
the
benefit
of
clergy
depends
upon
a
statute
it
had
probably
been
obtained
by
the
priests
to
put
their
privilege
out
of
doubt
it
has
been
a
declaratory
statute
although
perhaps
every
man
who
was
initiated
could
not
read
and
write
yet
i
believe
every
man
who
could
read
and
write
was
initiated
these
arts
being
taught
to
the
initiated
only
in
very
early
times
it
has
been
said
that
the
privilege
of
clergy
was
granted
to
encourage
learning
i
believe
it
was
used
as
a
test
as
a
proof
that
a
man
was
of
or
immediately
belonging
to
the
sacred
tribe
and
therefore
exempt
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
which
he
had
been
tried
if
he
were
accused
he
said
nothing
if
found
guilty
he
pleaded
his
orders
and
his
reading
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
knowledge
of
reading
and
letters
were
a
masonic
secret
for
many
generations
and
that
it
formed
part
of
the
mysterious
knowledge
of
eleusis
and
other
woman
was
represented
as
the

of
hell
as
the
mother

she
should
be

very
thought
that
she
is
a
woman
she
should
live
in
continual
penance
on
account
of
the
curses
she
had
brought
upon
the
world
she
should
be
ashamed
of
her
dress
for
it
is
the
memorial
of
her

she
should
especially
be
ashamed
of
her

blackstone

to
form

can
do
so
by
examining
it

s
collection
of
the

of
the

of
the
first
three
centuries
to
be
all
forged
and
a
shameless
imposture
the
famous
law
of
constantine
attached
to
the
theodosian
code
by
virtue
of
which
a
prodigious
and
monstrous
jurisdiction
was
formerly
attributed
to
bishops
or
to
the
hieratic
order
though
in
reality
that
law
was
never
a
part
of
the
aforesaid
code
at
the
end
of
which
it
is
found
on
at
time
of
valentinian
neither
bishops
nor
the
consistories
could
without
the
consent
of
the
contracting
lay
parties
take
cognizance
of
their
causes
because
says
that
emperor
it
is
evident
that
bishops
and
priests
have
no
court
to
determine
the
laws
in
neither
can
they
according
to
the
imperial
constitutions
of
arcadius
and
honorius
as
is
manifest
from
the
theodosian
body
judge
of
any
other
matters
than
those
relating
to
religion
thus
the
aforesaid
emperor
valentinian
neither
do
i
think
that
the
above
sanction
as
extravagant
obtained
a
place
at
the
end
of

accepted
early
in

those

without

filled
with
the
warmest
domestic
affections
and
instincts
and
how
strong
those
feelings
were
in
him
was
fully
demonstrated
in
his
will
and
is
clearly

a
roman
correspondent
of

seems
in
some
manner
to
have
wormed
out
the
essential

several
visits
to
his

i
remember
says
the
dame
that
when
i
went
to
open
the
door
to
them
i
held
in
my
hand
a
bowl
of
beef
tea
which
i
was
taking
to
the
patient
lucchini
was
the
first
to
enter
and
i
soon
recognized
the
second
visitor
to
be
cardinal
antonelli
who
wore
a
long
redingote
and
a
tall
hat
he
took
the
bowl
which
i
held
in
my
hand
this
is
for
the
patient
he
said
inquiringly
but
before
i
had
time
to
reply
he
had
swallowed
part
of
its
dame
gervasi
then
proceeded
to
relate
how
lucchini
left
the
cardinal
alone
with
the
foreign
young
lady
the
witness
put
her
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
heard
distinctly
the
sound
of
kisses
alternating
with
sobs
between
the
two
his
eminence
to
console
the
patient
told
her
he
had
taken
every
precaution
against
the

don

he
said

will
be
able
to
marry

take

and
i
swear
to
you
that
she
will
never

the

of

traceable
to

left
regent
of
her
husband
s
kingdom
comprising
a
part
of
britain
two
hundred
years
prior
to
the
christian
era
this
queen
directed
her
attention
to
framing
a
system
of
laws
which
acquired
for
her
the
surname
of
proba
or
the
they
were
evidently
one
of
the
three
parts
under
which
the
common
law
is
divided

under
canon
law
the
entire
property
of
the
wife
became
that
of
the

in

in
or
even
earlier
it
was
calculated
that
besides
the
tithes
of
the
kingdom
was
ecclesiastical
property
and
that
these
vast
possessions
were
devoted
to
the
support
of
a
body
of
men
who
found
their
whole
serious
occupation
in
destroying
the
virtue
of
women
the
pagan
laws
during
the
empire
had
been
continually
repealing
the
old
disabilities
of
women
and
the
legislative
movement
in
their
favor
continued
with
unabated
force
from
constantine
to
justinian
and
appeared
also
in
some
of
the
early
laws
of
the
barbarians
but
in
the
whole
feudal
legislation
women
were
placed
in
a
much
lower
legal
position
than
in
the
pagan
empire
in
addition
to
the
personal
restrictions
which
grew
necessarily
out
of
the
catholic
christian
doctrines
concerning
divorce
and
the
subordination
of
the
weaker
sex
we
find
numerous
and
stringent
enactments
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
women
to
succeed
to
any
considerable
amount
of
property
and
which
almost
reduced
them
to
the
alternative
of
marriage
or
a
nunnery
the
complete
inferiority
of
the
sex
was
continually
maintained
by
law
and
that
generous
public
opinion
which
in
rome
had
frequently
revolted
against
the
injustice
done
to
girls
in
depriving
them
of
the
greater
part
of
the
inheritance
of
their
fathers
totally
disappeared
wherever
the
canon
law
has
been
the
basis
of
legislation
we
find
laws
of
succession
sacrificing
the
interests
of
daughters
and
of
wives
and
a
state
of
public
opinion
which
has
been
formed
and
regulated
by
these
laws
nor
was
any
serious
attempt
made
to
abolish
them
till

of

last
century
the
french
revolutionists
though
rejecting

proposal
of

and
condorcet
to
accord
political
emancipation
to

established
at
least
an
equal
succession
of

and

much

was
caused

abolished
this

in
his
a

of

and
a

of

was
afterwards
substituted
for
a

ransom
but
even
this
redemption
was
in
most
cases
entirely
beyond
the
power
of
the
serf
under
the
feudal
system
the
lord
of
the
manor
held
unlimited
sway
over
his
serfs
he
farther
possessed
the
primae
right
of
the
first
night
which
he
could
however
relinquish
in
virtue
of
a
certain
payment
the
name
of
which
betrayed
its
nature
it
has
been
latterly
asserted
that
this
right
never
existed
an
assertion
which
to
me
appears
entirely
unfounded
it
is
clear
the
right
was
not
a
written
one
that
it
was
not
summed
up
in
paragraphs
it
was
the
natural
consequence
of
the
dependent
relationship
and
required
no
registration
in
any
book
of
law
if
the
female
serf
pleased
the
lord
he
enjoyed
her
if
not
he
let
her
alone
in
hungary
transylvania
and
the
danubian
principalities
there
was
no
written
primae
either
but
one
learns
enough
of
this
subject
by
inquiry
of
those
who
know
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
as
to
the
manners
which
prevail

he
said
our

seems
to
have
developed
an
almost
unknown
phase
of
crime
in
the
annals
of
the
race
and
today
the
traffic
in
girls
and
young
women
in
this
country
especially
in
our
large
cities
has
come
to
be
more
disgraceful
and
worse
than
ever
was
that
in
the
girls
of
this
christianity
of
ours
has
much
to
answer
s
it
was
at
one
time
proposed
to
arrest
all
women
out
alone
in

what
were
these

doing
asked

nothing

why
did
you
arrest

are

there
is
no

for
these
poor

in

case
a
girl
escaped
after
being
shot
in

and
took
refuge
in
a
swamp
dogs
were
started
on

trail
and
she
was
hunted
down
and
taken
back
to
her
den

another
case
a
girl
escaped
while
a
dance
was
going
on
at
the
shanty
into
which
she
had
been
lured
after
several
days
and
nights
of
privation
she
made
her

a
man
named
stanley
lived
but
the
dogs
and
human
bloodhounds
trailed
her
stanley
was
overcome
and
the
girl
was
taken
back
the
law
now
provides
for
imprisonment
of
only
one
year
in
case
of
conviction
of
any
connection
with
this
traffic
and
it
is
proposed
to
amend
tales
of
a
horrible
character

us
from

the

into

the
question
why
the
immense

of

attracted
attention
it
was
answered
by
the
inherent
wickedness
of
the
sex
which
had
its
influence
in
men
to
believe
in

also
in
producing

the

an
unusually
small

was
fully
apprized
that

can
not
be
maintained
without
property

thereupon

attention
began
very
early
to
be
riveted
upon
every
method
that
promised
pecuniary
advantage

now
at

to
take
her
farewell
of

casting
her

her
any

or
the

it
never

small

she

you
will
hardly
believe

i
saw
a

s
skull
the
other

at

party
i
had
the
pleasure
of
attending
it
was
at
the
house
of
dow
a
medical
gentleman
of
culture
and
great
skill
in
his
profession
here
you
will
admit
that
a
skull
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
exhibit
in
a
parlor
and
some
of
the
ladies
did
not
care
about
seeing
it
but
the
majority
did
and
you
know
one
can
not
see
a
witch
s
skull
every
day
so
after
a
little
hesitation
and
persuasion
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
he
produced
the
uncanny
thing
and
gave
us
its
history
or
rather
that
of
the
witch
she
lived
at
terryburn
a
little
place
near
here
one
day
it
came
to
the
ears
of
the
kirk
session
of
the
parish
that
she
had
had
several
interviews
with
his
satanic
majesty
strange
enough
when
the
woman
was
brought
before
that
seems
to
have
been
in
the
several
parishes
in
those
accused
of
it
she
at
once
admitted
the
charge
to
be
true
the
poor
soul
who
could
have
been
nothing
else
than
an
idiot
as
the
doctor
pointed
out
from
the
very
low
forehead
and
small
brain
cavity
was
sentenced
to
be
prevented
from
going
to
sleep
or
in
other
words
tortured
to
death
and
the
desired
end
was
attained
in
about
five
days
her
body
being
buried
below
mark
her
name
was
lilias
adie
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
was
only
a
harmless
imbecile
the
skull
and
also
a
piece
of
the
coffin
were
presented
to
the
doctor
by
a
friend
who
had
read
in
the
kirk
session
records
an
account
of
the
trial
and
went
to
the
spot
stated
as
being
the
place
of
burial
the
remains
were
found
by
him
exactly
as
indicated
although
there
was
nothing
to
mark
their
resting
place
one
would
have
thought
that
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
find
them
but
you
know
things
do
not
undergo
such
radical
changes
in
this
country
as
they
do
in
a
traveler
s
letter
in
the
syracuse
journal
august
almost
indistinguished
from
the
belief
in
witchcraft
was
the
belief
that
persons
subject
to
epilepsy
mania
or
any
form
of
mental
weakness
were
possessed
of
a
devil
who
could
be
expelled
by
certain
religious
ceremonies
of
crime
in
vol
pp
the
mysteries
of
the
human
conscience
and
of
human
motives
are
well
nigh
inscrutable
and
it
may
be
shocking
to
assert
that
these
customs
of
unmitigated
wrong
are
indirectly
traceable
to
that
religion
of
which
the
two
great
commandments
were
that
man
should
love
his
neighbor
as
himself

him
in

it
was
observed
they
devils
had
a
peculiar
attachment
to
women
with
beautiful
hair
and
it
was
an
old
catholic
belief
that
paul
alluded
to
this
in
that
somewhat
obscure
passage
in
which
he
exhorts
women
to
cover
their
heads
because
of
the
the
attention
of
scientific
men
and
governments
has
recently
been
directed
to
what
are
now
called
accursed
under
whose
action
certain
crimes
have
been
committed
from
suggestion
the
hand
which
executed
being
only
that
of
an
irresponsible
automaton
whose
memory
preserves
no
traces
of
it
the
french
academy
has
just
been
debating
the
far
a
hypnotized
subject
from
a
mere
victim
can
become
a
regular
tool
of
october
merck
s
bulletin
new
york
medical
journal
in
an
editorial
entitled
december
relates
some
astonishing
experiments
recently
made
at
the
de
la
paris
in
which
the
power
to
exteriorize
sensibility
has
been
discovered
reproducible
at
will
suggestion
through
means
of
simulated
pinching
producing
suffering
photographs
sensitive
to
their
originals
even
having
been
produced
thus
modern
science
stamps
with
truthfulness
the
power
asserted
as
pertaining
to
black
magicians
of
causing
suffering
or
death
through
means
of
a
waxen
image
of
a
person
accursed
although
brought
to
the
bar
of
modern
investigating
knowledge
seem
not
yet
to
have
yielded
the
secrets
of
the
law
under
which
they
are
rendered
possible
in
six
hundred
sorcerers
were
convicted
in
the
province
of
bordeaux
france
most
of
whom
were
within
the
last
year
fourteen
women
have
been
tried
in
france
for
sorcery
the
supreme
end
of
magic
is
to
conjure
the
spirits
the
highest
and
most
inscrutable
of
all
the
powers
dwells
in
the
divine
and
mysterious
name
the
supreme
name
with
which
hea
alone
is
acquainted
before
this
name
everything
bows
in
heaven
and
earth
and
in
hades
and
it
alone
can
conquer
the
maskim
and
stop
their
ravages
the
great
name
remained
the
secret
of
hea
if
any
man
succeeded
in
divining
it
that
alone
would
invest
him
with
a
power
superior
to
the
magic
and
venetians
concluded
not
unreasonably
that
the
latter
ran
no
more
risk
from
the
taint
of
witchcraft
attached
to
their
inheritance
than
did
the
clergy
or
the
church
where
profits
were
all
spiritual
their
ardor
soon
cooled
thus
it
happened
as
the
inevitable
result
of
the
people
s
attitude
in
religious
matters
that
while
in
venice
there
were
representatives
of
the
vast
sisterhood
which
extended
from
the
blockula
of
sweden
to
the
walnut
tree
of
benevenuto
sorcery
there
never
became
the
terrible
scourge
that
it
was
in
other
lands
where
its
victims
at
times
threatened
to
outnumber
those
of
the
black
witches
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
features
of
the
belief
in
witchcraft
was
the
power
that
greed
had
in
producing
belief
and
causing
persecution
the
church
had
grown
rich
from
such
trials
and
the
state
was
now
to
take
its
turn
by
the
public
offering
of
a
reward
for
the
finding
of
witches
their
numbers
greatly
increased
the
most
exceptional
conduct
the
purest
morals
in
constant
practice
of
every
day
life
are
not
sufficient
security
against
the
suspicion
of
errors
like
for
a
number
of
years
her
celebrated
son
struggled
amid
his
scientific
studies
for
the
preservation
of
her
life

filled
every
place
in
the
sabbath
following
its
celebration
was
the
denial
of
jesus
by
whose
authority
the
priests
and
barons
robbed
the
serf
of
human
paying
of
homage
to
the
new
feudal
kiss
to
the
closing
ceremonies
the
feast
of
peace
no
man
was
admitted
unaccompanied
by
a
this
word
at
different
times
clearly
meant
quite
different
things
in
the
century
under
the
avignon
popes
during
the
great
schism
when
the
church
with
two
heads
seems
no
longer

the
sabbath
took
the
horrible
form
of
the
black
this
important
part
of
the

her

known
to
us
by
the
trial
of

which
revanna

with
other

that

have
been
more
addicted

this
devilish

quintillian
referring
to
this
statement

witchcraft

idiots
the

up
with
bacon

inquiries
into
witchcraft
ignatius
from
the
accession
of
james
witchcraft
became
the
master
superstition
of
the
age
the
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
was
practically
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
the
mere
fact
of
accusation
was
equal
to
condemnation
and
customs
of
seeress
of
iron
collars
or
witches
bridles
are
still
preserved
in
various
parts
of
scotland
which
had
been
used
for
such
iniquitous
purposes
these
instruments
were
so
constructed
that
by
means
of
a
loop
which
passed
over
the
head
a
piece
of
iron
having
four
points
or
prongs
was
forcibly
thrust
into
the
mouth
two
of
these
being
directed
to
the
tongue
and
palate
the
others
pointing
outward
to
each
cheek
this
infernal
machine
was
secured
by
a
padlock
at
the
back
of
the
collar
was
fixed
a
ring
by
which
to
attach
the
witch
to
a
staple
in
the
wall
of
her
cell
thus
equipped
and
day
and
night
waked
and
watched
by
some
skillful
person
appointed
by
her
inquisitors
the
unhappy
creature
after
a
few
days
of
such
discipline
maddened
by
the
misery
of
her
forlorn
and
helpless
state
would
be
rendered
fit
for
confessing
anything
in
order
to
be
rid
of
the
dregs
of
her
life
at
intervals
fresh
examinations
took
place
and
they
were
repeated
from
time
to
time
until
her
contumacy
as
it
was
termed
was
subdued
the
clergy
and
kirk
sessions
appear
to
have
been
the
unwearied
instruments
of
purging
the
land
of
witchcraft
and
them
in
the
first
instance
all
the
complaints
and
informations
were
vol
part
who
has
not
heard
of
the
langholm
witches
and
the
branks
to
subdue
them
this
was
a
simple
instrument
formed
so
as
to
fit
firmly
on
the
head
and
to
project
into
the
mouth
a
sharp
spike
for
subjugating
the
tongue
it
was
much
preferred
to
the
which
not
only
endangered
the
health
of
the
patient
but
also
gave
the
tongue
liberty
betwixt
every
dip
scores
of
these
patients
were
burned
alongside
langholm
castle
and
the
spot
is
fully
as
interesting
as
our
own
reminder
of
the
gentle
days
gallows
hill
at
by
statute
of
henry
all
witchcraft
and
sorcery
was
to
be
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
this
act
continued
in
force
till
lately
to
the
terror
of
all
ancient
females
in
the
as
bad
as
the
georges
are
depicted
thanks
are
due
to
two
of
them
from
women
by
statute
of
george
no
future
prosecution
was
to
be
carried
on
against
any
person
for
conjuration
witchcraft
sorcery
or
enchantment
towards
the
end
of
there
was
trouble
in
the
family
of
the
earl
of
orkney
his
brother
laid
a
plot
to
murder
him
and
was
said
to
have
sought
the
help
of
a
notorious
witch
called
allison
no
evidence
could
be
found
connecting
her
with
this
particular
offense
or
with
witchcraft
in
general
but
it
was
enough
in
these
matters
to
be
a
woman
and
to
be
accused
she
swore
she
was
innocent
but
she
was
looked
upon
as
a
pagan
who
thus
aggravated
her
guilt
she
was
tortured
again
and
again
but
being
innocent
she
constantly
declared
her
innocence
her
legs
were
put
into
the
iron
which
was
gradually
heated
until
it
burned
into
the
flesh
but
no
confession
could
be
wrung
from
her
the
casctulars
having
utterly
failed
to
make
her
tell
a
lie
the
powers
that
be
whom
paul
tells
us
are
of
god
tortured
her
husband
her
son
and
her
daughter
a
little
child
of
only
seven
years
the
powers
knew
the
tenderness
and
love
of
a
wife
and
mother
so
they
first
brought
her
husband
into
court
and
placed
him
by
her
side
he
was
placed
in
the
long
irons
some
accursed
instrument
she
did
not
yield
then
her
son
was
tortured
the
poor
boy
s
legs
were
set
in
the
boot
the
iron
boot
and
wedges
were
driven
in
which
forced
home
crushed
the
very
bone
and
marrow
mallet
strokes
were
delivered
upon
the
wedges
yet
this
failed
this
innocent
tortured
heroic
woman
would
not
confess
to
a
lie
so
last
of
all
her
baby
daughter
was
brought
in
the
fair
child
of
seven
short
years
there
was
a
machine
called
the
pinniwinkies
a
kind
of
thumb
screw
which
brought
blood
from
under
the
finger
nails
with
a
pain
terribly
severe
these
tortures
were
applied
to
the
baby
hands
and
the
mother
s
fortitude
broke
down
and
she
would
admit
any
thing
they
wished
she
confessed
the
witchcraft
so
tired
she
would
have
confessed
the
seven
deadly
sins
but
this
suffering
did
not
save
her
to
her
family
she
was
burned
alive
with
her
last
suffering
breath
protesting
her
innocence
this
account
is
perfectly
well
authenticated
and
taken
from
the
official
report
of
the
proceedings
stories
on
great
the
same
dark
superstition
shared
the
civil
councils
of
scotland
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
the
convictions
which
then
took
place
are
chiefly
to
be
ascribed
to
the
ignorance
and
fanaticism
of
the
clergy
excommunication
was
both
of
temporal
and
spiritual
effect
the
person
under
ban
not
only
being
deprived
of
absolution
extreme
unction
consecrated
burial
but
all
persons
were
forbidden
to
deal
with
the
recalcitrant
under
the
strictest
protestantism
in
scotland
the
clergy
held
almost
entire
control
when
a
woman
fell
under
suspicion
of
being
a
witch
the
minister
denounced
her
from
the
pulpit
forbade
anyone
harboring
or
sheltering
her
and
exhorted
his
parishoners
to
give
evidence
against
her
to
the
clergy

has
received

in
all

regarded
as

thing

character

constant

deliberately
sanctioned

expend

equivalent

original
price

a
new
bride

he
formally
delivered
to
the

were
these
laws
merely
secular

were
enacted
and
enforced
by
all
the
dread
power
of

in
the
century
either
the
female
character
was
utterly
dissolute
or
the
tyranny
of
husbands
utterly
reckless
when
we
find
that
it
was
no
uncommon
circumstance
that
women
were
strangled
by
masked
assassins
or
walking
by
the
river

were
plunged
into

this
drowning
of
women
gave
rise
to
a
popular
proverb
it
is
nothing

a

this
condition
constituted
the
domestic
life
of
england
from
the
century
to
the
first
civil
war
when
the
taste
of
men
for
bloodshed
found
wider
scope
and
from
the
murder
of

they
advanced
to
the
practice
of
cutting

the

she
was
kept
strictly
under

and
the
kind
of
discipline
which

well
illustrated
by
a
letter
written
late
in

of

looks
upon

to
us
nothing

a
chimerical
and
monstrous

the
other
day
a
woman
in
this
city
under
some
ancient
unrepealed
law
of
this
state
was
arrested
and
brought
before
a
magistrate
on
the
charge
of
being
a

scold
a
too

tongue
was
reckoned
a
public
offense
in
all
the
american
colonies
and
in
england
the
lawful
punishment
of
common
scolds
was
continued
until
a
recent
day
it
was
for
these
that
the
was
invented
which
usually
consists
of
a
heavy
chair
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
large
piece
of
timber
which
was
hung
by
the
middle
to
a
post
on
the
river
side
the
offender
was
tied
into
the
chair
and
then
soused
into
the
water
until
it
was
judged
that
her
shrewishness
had
departed
from
her
sometimes
she
was
dipped
so
thoroughly
that
her
breath
departed
for
good
as
happened
to
a
certain
elderly
lady
at
ratcliffe
highway
the
was
constantly
hanging
in
its
place
and
on
the
back
of
it
were
engraved
devils
laying

of
scolds
st

if
it
is
a
crime
to
buy
and
sell
wives
let
the
men
who
do
such
things
be
punished
if
there
is
no
crime
in

why
should
the
wife
who
is
sold
be
punished

keep

for
every
beating
given
her
by
her
husband
except
for
three
things
and
those
three
for
which
she
may
be
beaten
are
for
giving
anything
she
ought
not
to
give
for
being
detected
with
another
man
in
a
covert
and
for
wishing
drivel
on
her
husband

and
if
for
being
found
with
another
man
he
chastises
her
he
is
not
to
have
any
satisfaction
beside
that
for
there
ought
not

be
both
satisfaction
and
vengeance
for
the

crime
her
gowyn

him
pay
her
six

pence
for

offense

detect
him
a

she
can
separate
from
him
without
leaving
anything
that
belongs
to
her
professor
of
welsh
law
the
law
enacts
that
she
ought
not
to
suffer
loss
on
account
of
the
man
since
she
received
no
benefit
from
him
and
therefore
he
is
to
rear
the
child
laws
and
institutions
of
the
welsh
laws
of
howell
the
good
were
enacted
by
four
laics
and
two
clerks
who
were
summoned
lest
the
laws
should
ordain
anything
contrary
to
scripture
a

can
not
be
admitted
as

or
as

concerning

woman
question
in
stanton
this
law
of
france
differs
greatly
from
the
old
welsh
law
which
threw
the
support
of
an
illegitimate
child
upon
the
father
notwithstanding
the
responsibility
thus
thrown
upon
her
a
french
proverb
declares
that
the
most
reasonable
woman
never
attains
the
sense
of
a
boy
of
it
was
no
mere
accident
that
the
french
language
only
possessed
one
word
for
man
and
human
being
french
law
only
recognizes
man
as
a
human
of
morals
of
the
baby
was
born
in
the
next
house
and
of
course
i
was
interested
how
can
one
not
be
interested
when
one
of
these
little
angels
becomes
imprisoned
in
the
earth
form
and
begins
a
career
that
makes
one
tremble
to
think
of
meeting
the
father
a
few
hours
later
i
ask
the
customary
question
another
no
account
girl
to
be
supported
he
said
gloomily
and
passed
s
a
father
of
experience
spoke
differently
my
gals
never
forget
me
they
married
and
went
away
to
their
own
homes
and
though
they
were
none
of
them
yet
not
one
of
them
ever
saw
the
time
she
wouldn
t
steal
a
dollar
from
her
husband
to
give
to
father
or
mother
but
it
isn
t
so
with
the
boys
they
never
knew
they
owed
me
anything
they
never
put
their
hands
in
their
pockets
for
me
they
never
laid
awake
o
nights
thinking
how
to
scrimp
household
expenses
to
get
me
or
mother
a
present
like
the
gals
did
and
yet
when
i
was
araisin
em
i
thought
one
boy
was
worth
a
dozen
see
a
story
is
told
by
an
american
traveller
of
a
party
met
upon
the
cars
the
mother
a
delicate
little
personage
the
father
stout
and
strong
upon
leaving
the
train
he
walked
off
incommoded
by
a
single
traveling
impedimenta
while
the
wife
was
almost
hidden
under
the
pack
she
was
carrying
with
indignation
the
american
asked
why
do
you
not
let
the
man
take
some
of
these
things
what
and
he
the
father
of
a
family
was
the
surprised
answer
it
is
unnecessary
to
let
the
whole
map
of
german
common
law
pass
in
review
a
few
specimens
will
suffice
according
to
german
common
law
woman
is
everywhere
in
the
position
of
a
minor
with
regard
to
man
her
husband
is
her
lord
and
master
to
whom
she
owes
obedience
in
marriage
if
she
be
disobedient
prussian
law
allows
a
husband
of
low
estate
to
inflict
moderate
bodily
chastisement
as
no
provision
is
made
for
the
number
or
severity
of
the
blows
the
amount
of
such
chastisement
is
left
to
the
sovereign
discretion
of
the
man
in
the
communal
law
of
hamburg
the
regulation
runs
as
follows
the
moderate
chastisement
of
a
wife
by
her
husband
is
just
and
similar
enactments
exist
in
many
parts
of
germany
the
prussian
common
law
further
decrees
that
the
husband
can
determine
the
length
of
time
during
which
a
woman
must
suckle
her
child
all
decisions
with
regard
to
the
children
rest
with
the
father
when
he
dies
the
wife
is
everywhere
under
the
obligation
of
accepting
a
guardian
for
the
children
she
is
decided
to
be
under
age
and
incapable
of
conducting
the
education
of
children
alone
even
when
their
means
of
support
are
derived
entirely
from
her
property
or
her
labor
her
fortune
is
managed
by
her
husband
and
in
cases
of
bankruptcy
is
regarded
in
most
states
as
his
and
disposed
of
accordingly
unless
a
special
contract
has
been
made
before
marriage
when
landed
property
is
entailed
on
the
eldest
child
a
daughter
has
no
rights
as
long
as
husband
or
brothers
are
alive
she
can
not
succeed
unless
she
has
no
brothers
or
has
lost
them
by
death
she
can
not
exercise
the
political
rights
which
are
as
a
rule
connected
with
landed
property
unless
in
some
exceptional
cases
as
for
instance
in
saxony
where
communal
regulations
in
the
country
allow
her
to
vote
but
deny
her
the
right
of
being
elected
but
even
this
right
is
transferred
to
her
husband
if
she
marry
in
most
states
she
is
not
free
to
conclude
agreements
without
the
consent
of
her
husband
unless
she
be
engaged
in
business
on
her
own
account
which
recent
legislation
permits
her
to
do
she
is
excluded
from
every
kind
of
public
activity
the
prussian
law
concerning
societies
forbids
and
apprentices
under
eighteen
and
women
to
take
part
in
political
associations
and
public
meetings
until
within
the
last
few
years
women
were
forbidden
by
various
german
codes
to
attend
the
public
law
courts
as
listeners
if
a
woman
becomes
pregnant
of
an
illegitimate
child
she
has
no
claim
on
support
if
she
accepted
any
present
from
the
father
at
the
time
of
their
intimacy
if
a
woman
is
divorced
from
her
husband
she
continues
to
bear
his
name
in
eternal
memory
of
him
unless
she
happens
to
marry
again
august
in
the
past

and
who
indeed
would
not
have

circumstances
elevate
her
to
a

position
she
becomes
a

and
this
opens
a
fresh
career
to
her

her
lines
thenceforward

an

a
person
of
consideration
no
disgrace

of

is
attached
to
the
irregularity
of
conduct
which
often
is
the
origin
of
her
promotion
to
a

sphere
her
wages
are
quadrupled
her

by
comparison
is
sumptuous
she
can
never
be
scolded
she
is
called
upon
to
fulfill
but
one
duty
the
occupation
is
so
much
more
remunerative
than
ordinary
service
that
one
can
scarcely
be
surprised
if
plenty
of
women
are
found
ready
and
willing
to
follow
the
trade
with
them
the

cumbered
about
with
so
many
restrictions
and
conditions
that
it
has
come
to
be
looked
upon

oriental
views
of
the
function
of
women
led
him
not
only
to
neglect
but
to
prevent
the
education
of
his
daughters
they
were
sent
to
no
school
at
all
but
were
handed
over
to
a
school
mistress
in
the
house

would
not

for
a

that

so
proper

this

he
proceeded
to
train
them
to
read

him

five

six
languages

he
the
schoolmaster
could
at
one
time
have
easily
taught
them

of

make

that

the
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
rendered
an
opinion
which
shows
that
married

in

are
still
in

sued
for
damages

for
a

the
ground
that
the
woman
was
working
for
her
husband
and
the
court
had
taken
into
account
her
loss
of
wages
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decision
and
sent
the
case
back
for
a
new
trial
it
held
that
the
services
of
a

belonged
to
her
husband
and
she
can
not
recover
any
wages
even
if
she
holds
his

promise
to

nine
generally
these
conventicles
produced
very
many
bastards
and
the
excuse
they
the

made
for
that
was
where
sin
abounds
the
grace
of

super
abounds
there
is
no
condemnation
in

that
are

of

sport
together
to

pure
all

generally
they
are
of
opinion
that
a

is
never
a
true
saint
till
he
have
a
fall
like
that

priestly
opposition

to

taking

work
still
continues
to
be
manifest
as
shown
by
the
tour
of
general

through
the
southern
states
in
the
fall
of
the
notorious

an
evidence
of
the
skepticism
of

nor
is
this
the

after

february

their
anathemas

this

as
inimical
to

and
especially
against
the

leading
in
this
step
in
addition
to
these
sermons
a

some
weeks
since
came
to
the
front
with
a
series
of
sermons
in
which
by
unsupported
assertion
he
managed
to
demonstrate
that
women
in
the
united
states
are
no
longer
ornamental
the
trouble
in
the
mind
of
the
reverend
seems
to
be
that
women
having
grown
in
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
of
that
liberty
wherewith
christ
maketh
free
have
concluded
that
their
sphere
is
not
to
be
man
s
plaything
a
human
gewgaw
to
be
fondled
caressed
or
kicked
as
the
masculine
mind
may
elect
if
it
is
important
for
man
to
know
himself
brave
women
have
concluded
that
it
is
quite
as
essential
for
a
woman
to
know
herself
and
with
a
heroism
born
of
rights
conferred
by
god
himself
women
have
in
these
latter
days
resolved
to
map
out
their
own
sphere
independent
of
man
s
dictation
they
have
made
commendable
headway
they
have
succeeded
in
shaking
down
a
number
of
antiquated
citadels
where
ignorance
superstition
prejudice
despotism
and
cruelty
found
refuge
and
as
they
tumbled
the
breath
of
popular
indignation
has
blown
the
fragments
away
like
chaff
in
the
grasp
of
a
tornado
these
brave
women
finding
out
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
set
themselves
about
solving
its
problems
for
themselves
and
for
their
sex
some
of
them
asked
for
the
ballot
why
because
they
wanted
to
obliterate
from
the
statute
books
such
laws
as
restricted
their
liberties
and
circumscribed
their
sphere
as
wives
they
wanted
to
be
the
equals
of
their
husbands
before
the
law
why
not
as
mothers
they
wanted
to
be
the
equal
of
their
sons
before
the
law
why
not
a
thousand
reasons
have
been
assigned
why
not
but
they
do
not
answer
the
demand
what
is
wanted
as
prudent
guarantees
that
the
ballot
will
be
wisely
wielded
by
those
upon
whom
the
great
right
has
been
conferred
the
answer
is
education
a
fair
comprehension
of
the
obligations
of
citizenship
loyalty
to
the
government
to
republican
institutions
and
the
welfare
of
society
it
is
not
contended
that
women
do
not
possess
these
qualifications
but
the
right
is
withheld
from
them
nevertheless
and
by
withholding
this
right
a
hundred
others
are
included
every
one
of
which
when
justice
bears
sway
will
be
granted
this
done
woman
s
sphere
will
regulate
itself
as
does
man
s
sphere
boston
in
a
recent
issue
takes
dix
to
task
for
narrowness
of
vision
and
weakness
of
grasp
in
discussing
the
calling
of
a
christian
woman
and
then
proceeds
to
outline
its
own
views
on
the
sphere
of
capable
women
in
which
it
is
less
robust
than
the
reverend
to
intimate
that
the
infinite
disposer
of
events
favors
the
narrow
vulgar
prejudices
of
rev
dix
and
his
organ
the
is
to
dwarf
the
almighty
to
human
proportions
and
bring
discredit
upon
his
attributes
in
the
midst
of
which
justice
shines
with
resplendent
glory
but
the
demand
is
that
women
themselves
shall
determine
for
themselves
the
boundaries
of
their
sphere
it
is
not
a
question
of
mere
sentiment
it
is
not
a
matter
of
fancy
or
caprice
it
is
rugged
question
it
involves
food
clothing
shelter
it
means
women
are
not
appealing
to
man
s
gallantry
not
to
any
quality
of
less
importance
than
his
sense
of
justice
for
their
rights
man
is
not
likely
to
regard
his
mother
with
less
affection
and
reverence
because
she
is
his
father
s
equal
and
in
the
past
when
women
were
more
degraded
than
at
present
the
best
men
have
found
in
women
inspiration
for
their
best
work
good
men
will
not
find
less
inspiration
for
good
work
when
women
are
emancipated
from
the
thraldom
of
vicious
laws
and
crowned
man
s
equal
in
all
matters
relating
to
sphere
shall
by
laws
relating
to
physical
and
mental
organism
take
their
chances
in
the
world
s
broad
field
of
battle
demanding
and
receiving
for
work
done
in
any
of
the
departments
of
human
activities
men
s
pay
when
they
perform
men
s
may
it
is
not
a
physiological
cause
which
produced
our
present
family
with
the
father
as
ruler
and
owner
of
all
by
a
singular
lack
of
oversight
in
making
up
the
and
lettering
the
cover
the
words
husband
and
wife
have
been
printed
as
though
they
referred
to
objects
of
equal
importance
even
the
carefully
trained
eye
of
a
former
editor
of
the
christian
register
the
rt
rev
huntington
bishop
of
central
new
york
who
furnishes
a
brief
and
cautious
introduction
to
the
volume
did
not
detect
this
error
it
has
been
left
to
us
to
call
attention
to
the
incongruity
of
the
and
to
give
the
sentiment
of
the
book
proper
typographical
expression
the
conventional
sobriety
and
ecclesiasticism
of
the
do
not
prepare
one
for
the
novelty
of
the
contents
it
is
only
by
reading
the
book
that
we
become
aware
of
them
the
sensation
of
the
reader
is
somewhat
the
same
as
one
would
have
on
going
into
a
building
which
from
the
facade
appeared
to
be
a
plain
dignified
episcopal
church
but
which
on
entering
he
found
to
be
a
mediaeval
circus
not
that
there
is
any
anything
intentionally
hilarious
in
the
arena
of
this
book
or
that
it
displays
any
athletic
vigor
of
thought
but
that
it
is
essentially
novel
and
revolutionary
gray
is
not
unconscious
of
the
novelty
of
his
doctrine
it
is
believed
he
says
that
the
position
of
this
essay
is
new
to
the
discussion
it
has
not
been
urged
or
stated
in
print
in
england
or
america
and
later
on
he
expresses
a
belief
that
some
will
smile
at
his
views
as
antiquated
and
all
of
these
claims
may
be
readily
granted
first
the
doctrine
is
new
it
is
new
at
least
in
its
present
new
as
adam
would
seem
to
be
if
he
put
on
a
modern
costume
dyed
his
gray
hairs
and
appeared
in
boston
as
a
social
christian
boston
who
has
forgotten
the
sublime
magnanimity
of
artemus
ward
when
he
proposed
on
a
certain
occasion
to
sacrifice
all
his
wife
s
relatives
this
is
exactly
what
dean
gray
theoretically
achieves
he
not
only
abolishes
his
own
wife
s
relatives
but
those
of
other
men
who
have
entered
into
the
marriage
relationship
he
makes
thorough
work
of
it
not
only
does
he
extinguish
the
wife
s
sister
as
a
relative
but
also
her
cousins
and
her
aunts
in
fact
he
even
abolishes
the
the
luxury
of
a
is
granted
to
the
wife
who
by
virtue
of
marriage
becomes
related
to
her
husband
s
mother
but
is
not
granted
to
the
husband
who
has
no
relation
whatever
to
the
mother
of
his
wife
as
to
the
sisters
the
cousins
and
the
aunts
there
may
be
a
reason
why
sir
joseph
porter
would
view
with
dismay
an
equal
addition
to
their
number
through
the
offices
of
matrimony
but
the
majority
of
men
not
blessed
with
a
similar
superfluity
would
hardly
wish
to
forego
this
delightful
form
of
conjugal
one
of
the
most
learned
colored
men
in
the
country
is
alexander
crummell
rector
of
luke
s
protestant
episcopal
church
washington
when
he
desired
to
study
for
holy
orders
he
applied
at
kenyon
college
gambier
but
was
refused
admission
he
made
applications
elsewhere
which
were
equally
unsuccessful
he
finally
went
to
oxford
england
and
there
took
a
full
course
he
is
an
eloquent
preacher
and
his
congregation
embraces
a
large
number
of
prominent
colored
corinthians
v
and
one
of
the
most
bitter
opponents
to
the
admission
of
the
women
lay
delegates
to
the
methodist
general
conference
as
reported
in
syracuse
new
york
morning
march
rev
neely
of
philadelphia
said
that
he
was
in
favor
of
submitting
the
question
to
the
annual
conferences
he
offered
the
following
amendment
to
the
report
of
the
committee
but
since
there
is
great
interest
in
this
question
and
since
the
church
generally
should
be
consulted
in
regard
to
such
an
important
matter
therefore
that
we
submit
to
the
annual
conferences
the
proposition
to
amend
the
second
restrictive
rule
by
amending
the
words
and
said
delegates
may
be
men
or
women
after
the
words
two
lay
delegates
for
an
annual
conference
so
that
it
would
read
nor
of
more
than
two
lay
delegates
for
an
annual
conference
and
the
said
delegates
may
be
men
or
the
amendment
was
seconded
by
new
york
may
debate
on
the
admission
of
women
delegates
was
one
of
the
most
lengthy
in
the
history
of
the
church
it
occupied
the
time
of
the
conference
during
the
larger
part
of
six
sessions
it
is
the
common
remark
too
that
never
before
was
a
subject
contested
in
this
body
with
such
obstinacy
not
to
say
bitterness
the
struggle
to
obtain
recognition
from
the
chair
was
a
revelation
to
those
who
did
not
know
previously
how
fond
methodists
are
of
speaking
in
meeting
the
instant
the
chairman
s
gavel
fell
announcing
the
termination
of
one
speech
fifty
delegates
or
more
were
on
their
feet
and
from
fifty
stentorian
voices
rang
out
the
pitiful
appeal
mr
chairman
this
was
the
order
of
affairs
from
the
beginning
of
the
debate
to
the
close
one
delegate
who
was
finally
recognized
proved
to
be
so
hoarse
from
his
protracted
efforts
to
get
the
floor
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
could
be
heard
when
he
did
get
syracuse
may
the
final
vote
excluding
women
from
this
conference
and
submitting
the
question
of
their
eligibility
to
the
annual
conferences
stood
to
exclude
and
submit
against
a
majority
of
only
of
the
total
vote
while
the
laymen
were
so
evenly
divided
that
the
change
of
one
vote
would
have
tied
them
if
now
the
annual
conference
shall
decree
by
a
vote
of
all
the
ministers
present
and
voting
that
women
are
eligible
and
if
four
years
hence
the
general
conference
by
a
vote
shall
ratify
that
decree
the
fair
sisters
will
thereafter
have
free
course
in
that
body
otherwise
they
will
be
tolerated
only
as
mere
from
the
fact
that
many
who
voted
to
submit
the
matter
to
the
annual
conference
did
so
not
because
they
wish
the
women
to
come
in
but
merely
as
the
best
method
of
getting
rid
of
a
troublesome
question
for
the
time
being
it
looks
as
though
their
chances
of
gaining
admittance
as
delegates
four
years
hence
were
little
better
if
any
than
in
the
present
syracuse
may
the
priesthood
now
too
oft
the
priesthood
wait
at
the
threshold
of
the
waiting
for
the
beck
and
nod
of
its
power
as

mummies
eve
lived
years
giving
birth
to
a
boy
and
a
girl
every
year
eve
lived
ten
years
longer
than
adam
they
must
give
this
first
woman
the
best
constitution
in
the
world
for
while
her
husband
lived
years
and
communicated
to
his
sons
for
several
generations
the
principle
of
so
long
a
life
which
is
no
less
applicable
to
eve
than
to
him
he
must
have
been
of
very
vigorous
constitution
turn
the
thing
as
you
will
it
will
always
be
an
argument
from
the
greater
to
the
less
to
show
that
eve
s
body
was
better
constituted
than
that
of
her
chapter
ten
the
resurrection
of
a
material
body
to
dwell
in
a
spiritual
when
a
quarter
of
the
human
race
assume
to
tell
me
what
i
must
do
i
may
be
too
much
disheartened
by
the
circumstance
to
see
clearly
the
absurdity
of
this
command
this
is
the
condition
of
women
for
whom
i
have
the
same
compassion
that
i
would
have
for
a
prisoner
so
long
cramped
in
a
narrow
cage
that
he
could
not
use
his
limbs
while
many
women
are
thinking
their
own
thoughts
there
are
others
without
so
potent
a
brain
who
have
as
yet
failed
to
see
the
absurdity
of
allowing
others
to
think
for
them
for
this
condition
of
mental
and
moral
blunders
the
church
is
waldo
when
reading
was
first
taught
women
in
america
said
clemence
lozier
it
was
opposed
on
the
ground
that
she
would
forget
her
father
s
or
husband
s
name
should
she
learn
to
read
and
write
geography
met
with
like
opposition
on
the
ground
of
its
tendency
to
make
her
dissatisfied
with
home
and
desirous
to
travel
while
the
records
of
history
show
that
the
first
public
examination
of
women
in
geometry
raised
a
cry
of
disapproval
over
the
whole
country
there
are
hard
and
ugly
facts
in
this
christendom
of
ours
and
its
history
includes
the
serfdom
and
nihilism
of
russia
the
drudgery
of
german
women
the
wrongs
of
the
irish
peasant
girl
the
little
english
girls
sold
each
year
to
gratify
the
lusts
of
the
aristocracy
all
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
all
the
burnings
of
the
witches
the
slavery
and
polygamy
of
america
and
the
thousand
iniquities
all
around
us
all
these
belong
to
the
history
of

clara
colby
editor
this
case
decided
adversely
to
woman
s
right
of
suffrage
by
the
territorial
supreme
court
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
through
the
efforts
of
austin
a
young
and
energetic
attorney
of
olympia
the
state
capital
the
points
raised
by
austin
were
that
the
bloomer
case
is
a
collusive
one
between
the
original
plaintiff
and
defendants
and
is
a
fraud
upon
all
friends
of
equal
suffrage
in
the
state
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
territory
was
erroneous
in
two
respects
that
the
statute
of
the
territory
conferring
suffrage
was
constitutional
and
that
women
are
