little
eyolf
by
henrik
ibsen
translated
with
an
introduction
by
william
archer
introduction
little
eyolf
was
written
in
christiania
during
and
published
in
copenhagen
on
december
in
that
year
by
this
time
correspondence
has
become
so
scanty
as
to
afford
us
no
clue
to
what
may
be
called
the
biographical
antecedents
of
the
play
even
of
anecdotic
history
very
little
attaches
to
it
for
only
one
of
the
characters
has
a
definite
model
been
suggested
ibsen
himself
told
his
french
translator
count
prozor
that
the
original
of
the
was
a
little
old
woman
who
came
to
kill
rats
at
the
school
where
he
was
educated
she
carried
a
little
dog
in
a
bag
and
it
was
said
that
children
had
been
drowned
through
following
her
this
means
that
ibsen
did
not
himself
adapt
to
his
uses
the
legend
so
familiar
to
us
in
browning
piper
of
but
found
it
ready
adapted
by
the
popular
imagination
of
his
native
place
skien
this
idea
ibsen
continued
to
count
prozor
was
just
what
i
wanted
for
bringing
about
the
disappearance
of
little
eyolf
in
whom
the
infatuation
note
the
french
word
used
by
count
prozor
is
infatuation
i
can
think
of
no
other
rendering
for
it
but
i
do
not
quite
know
what
it
means
as
applied
to
allmers
and
eyolf
and
the
feebleness
of
his
father
reproduced
but
concentrated
exaggerated
as
one
often
sees
them
in
the
son
of
such
a
father
elias
tells
us
that
a
who
in
middle
life
suggested
to
him
the
figure
of
lona
hessel
was
in
later
years
the
model
for
the
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
these
two
accounts
of
the
matter
the
idea
was
doubtless
suggested
by
his
recollection
of
the
of
skien
while
traits
of
manner
and
physiognomy
might
be
borrowed
from
the
lady
in
question
the
verse
quoted
on
pp
and
transcriber
note
there
stood
the
champagne
in
act
i
is
the
last
line
of
a
very
poem
by
johan
sebastian
welhaven
entitled
written
in
an
unknown
guest
in
a
paris
restaurant
has
been
challenged
by
a
noisy
party
of
young
frenchmen
to
join
them
in
drinking
a
health
to
poland
he
refuses
they
denounce
him
as
a
craven
and
a
slave
he
bares
his
breast
and
shows
the
scars
of
wounds
received
in
fighting
for
the
country
whose
lost
cause
has
become
a
subject
for
conventional
enthusiasm
and
windy
rhetoric
de
saae

men

they
looked
at
each
other
he
went
on
his
way
there
stood
their
champagne
but
they
did
not
touch
it
the
champagne
incident
leads
me
to
wonder
whether
the
relation
between
rita
and
allmers
may
not
have
been
partly
suggested
to
ibsen
by
the
relation
between
charlotte
stieglitz
and
her
weakling
of
a
husband
their
story
must
have
been
known
to
him
through
george
brandes
if
not
more
directly
from
time
to
time
says
brandes
there
came
over
her
what
she
calls
her
she
grieves
that
this
is
no
longer
the
case
with
him
note
currents
of
nineteenth
century
vol
vi
did
the
germ
of
the
incident
lie
in
these
words
the
first
performance
of
the
play
in
norway
took
place
at
the
christiania
theatre
on
january
fru
wettergren
playing
rita
and
fru
dybwad
asta
in
copenhagen
march
fru
oda
nielsen
and
fru
hennings
played
rita
and
asta
respectively
while
emil
poulsen
played
allmers
the
first
german
rita
deutsches
theater
berlin
january
was
frau
agnes
sorma
with
reicher
as
allmers
six
weeks
later
frl
sandrock
played
rita
at
the
burgtheater
vienna
in
may
the
play
was
acted
by
company
in
paris
the
first
performance
in
english
took
place
at
the
avenue
theatre
london
on
the
afternoon
of
november
with
miss
janet
achurch
as
rita
miss
elizabeth
robins
as
asta
and
patrick
campbell
as
the
miss
achurch
rita
made
a
profound
impression
patrick
campbell
afterwards
played
the
part
in
a
short
series
of
evening
performances
in
the
spring
of
the
play
was
acted
in
chicago
by
a
company
of
scandinavian
amateurs
presumably
in
norwegian
fru
oda
nielsen
has
recently
i
understand
given
some
performances
of
it
in
new
york
and
madame
alla
nazimova
has
announced
it
for
production
during
the
coming
season
as
the
external
history
of
is
so
short
i
am
tempted
to
depart
from
my
usual
practice
and
say
a
few
words
as
to
its
matter
and
meaning
george
brandes
writing
of
this
play
has
rightly
observed
that
a
kind
of
dualism
has
always
been
perceptible
in
ibsen
he
pleads
the
cause
of
nature
and
he
castigates
nature
with
mystic
morality
only
sometimes
nature
is
allowed
the
first
voice
sometimes
morality
in
master
and
in
the
lover
of
nature
in
ibsen
was
predominant
here
as
in
and
wild
the
castigator
is
in
the
ascendant
so
clearly
is
this
the
case
in
that
ibsen
seems
almost
to
fall
into
line
with
thomas
hardy
to
say
nothing
of
analogies
of
detail
between
and
the
there
is
this
radical
analogy
that
they
are
both
utterances
of
a
profound
pessimism
both
indictments
of
nature
but
while
hardy
pessimism
is
plaintive
and
passive
ibsen
is
stoical
and
almost
bracing
it
is
true
that
in
this
play
he
is
no
longer
the
mere
indignation
pessimist
whom
brandes
quite
justly
recognised
in
his
earlier
works
his
analysis
has
gone
deeper
into
the
heart
of
things
and
he
has
put
off
the
satirist
and
the
iconoclast
but
there
is
in
his
thought
an
incompressible
energy
of
revolt
a
pessimist
in
contemplation
he
remains
a
meliorist
in
action
he
is
not
like
hardy
content
to
let
the
flag
droop
high
his
protagonist
still
runs
it
up
to
the
and
looks
forward
steadily
to
the
heavy
day
of
work
before
him
but
although
the
note
of
the
conclusion
is
resolute
almost
serene
the
play
remains
none
the
less
an
indictment
of
nature
or
at
least
of
that
egoism
of
passion
which
is
one
of
her
most
potent
subtleties
in
this
view
allmers
becomes
a
type
of
what
we
may
roughly
call
the
free
moral
agent
eyolf
a
type
of
humanity
conceived
as
passive
and
suffering
thrust
into
existence
with
boundless
aspirations
and
cruelly
limited
powers
rita
a
type
of
the
egoistic
instinct
which
is
a
consuming
fire
and
asta
a
type
of
the
beneficent
love
which
is
possible
only
so
long
as
it
is
exempt
from
the
law
of
change
allmers
then
is
egoism
egoism
which
can
now
and
then
break
its
chains
look
in
its
own
visage
realise
and
shrink
from
itself
while
rita
until
she
has
passed
through
the
awful
crisis
which
forms
the
matter
of
the
play
is
unconscious
reckless
and
ruthless
egoism
exigent
and
jealous
holding
to
its
rights
and
incapable
even
of
rising
into
the
secondary
stage
of
maternal
love
the
offspring
and
the
victim
of
these
egoisms
is
eyolf
little
wounded
warrior
who
longs
to
scale
the
heights
and
dive
into
the
depths
but
must
remain
for
ever
chained
to
the
crutch
of
human
infirmity
for
years
allmers
has
been
a
restless
and
slave
to
rita
imperious
temperament
he
has
dreamed
and
theorised
about
responsibility
and
has
kept
eyolf
poring
over
his
books
in
the
hope
that
despite
his
misfortune
he
may
one
day
minister
to
parental
vanity
finally
he
breaks
away
from
rita
for
the
first
time
in
all
these
ten
years
goes
up
into
the
infinite
solitudes
looks
death
in
the
face
and
returns
shrinking
from
passion
yearning
towards
selfless
love
and
filled
with
a
profound
and
remorseful
pity
for
the
lot
of
poor
maimed
humanity
he
will
help
eyolf
to
bring
his
desires
into
harmony
with
what
lies
attainable
before
him
he
will
create
a
conscious
happiness
in
his
mind
and
here
the
drama
opens
before
the
enters
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
to
point
out
that
here
again
ibsen
adopts
that
characteristic
method
which
in
writing
of
lady
from
the
and
master
i
have
compared
to
the
method
of
hawthorne
the
story
he
tells
is
not
really
or
rather
not
inevitably
supernatural
everything
is
explicable
within
this
limits
of
nature
but
supernatural
agency
is
also
vaguely
suggested
and
the
reader
imagination
is
stimulated
without
any
absolute
violence
to
his
sense
of
reality
on
the
plane
of
everyday
life
then
the
is
a
crazy
and
uncanny
old
woman
fabled
by
the
peasants
to
be
a
in
her
leisure
moments
who
goes
about
the
country
killing
vermin
coming
across
an
impressionable
child
she
tells
him
a
preposterous
tale
adapted
from
the
old
pied
piper
legends
of
her
method
of
fascinating
her
victims
the
child
whose
imagination
has
long
dwelt
on
this
personage
is
in
fact
hypnotised
by
her
follows
her
down
to
the
sea
and
watching
her
row
away
turns
dizzy
falls
in
and
is
drowned
there
is
nothing
impossible
nothing
even
improbable
in
this
at
the
same
time
there
can
not
be
the
least
doubt
i
think
that
in
the
poet
mind
the
is
the
symbol
of
death
of
the
still
soft
darkness
that
is
at
once
so
fearful
and
so
fascinating
to
humanity
this
is
clear
not
only
in
the
text
of
her
single
scene
but
in
the
fact
that
allmers
in
the
last
act
treats
her
and
his
of
that
night
among
the
mountains
not
precisely
as
identical
but
as
interchangeable
ideas
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
even
my
own
suspicions
as
to
who
is
meant
by
her
sweetheart
whom
she
lured
long
ago
and
who
is
now
down
where
all
the
rats
are
this
theory
i
shall
keep
to
myself
it
may
be
purely
fantastic
and
is
at
best
inessential
what
is
certain
is
that
death
carries
off
little
eyolf
and
that
of
all
he
was
only
the
crutch
is
left
mute
witness
to
his
hapless
lot
he
is
gone
there
was
so
little
to
bind
him
to
life
that
he
made
not
even
a
moment
struggle
against
the
allurement
of
the
long
sweet
sleep
then
for
the
first
time
the
depth
of
the
egoism
which
had
created
and
conditioned
his
little
life
bursts
upon
his
gaze
like
accomplices
in
crime
they
turn
upon
and
accuse
each
other
sorrow
makes
them
wicked
and
hateful
allmers
as
the
one
whose
eyes
were
already
half
opened
is
the
first
to
carry
war
into
the
enemy
country
but
rita
is
not
slow
to
retort
and
presently
they
both
have
to
admit
that
their
recriminations
are
only
a
vain
attempt
to
drown
the
voice
of
in
a
sort
of
fierce
frenzy
they
tear
away
veil
after
veil
from
their
souls
until
they
realise
that
eyolf
never
existed
at
all
so
to
speak
for
his
own
sake
but
only
for
the
sake
of
their
passions
and
vanities
is
it
curious
says
rita
summing
up
the
matter
that
we
should
grieve
like
this
over
a
little
stranger
boy
in
blind
they
have
played
with
life
and
death
and
now
the
great
open
eyes
of
the
stranger
boy
will
be
for
ever
upon
them
allmers
would
fain
take
refuge
in
a
love
untainted
by
the
egoism
and
unexposed
to
the
revulsions
of
passion
but
not
only
is
asta
pity
for
rita
too
strong
to
let
her
countenance
this
desertion
she
has
discovered
that
her
relation
to
allmers
is
exempt
from
the
law
of
change
and
she
takes
flight
from
him
and
from
herself
meanwhile
it
appears
that
the
agony
which
allmers
and
rita
have
endured
in
probing
their
wounds
has
been
as
halvard
solness
would
say
salutary
the
consuming
fire
of
passion
is
now
quenched
but
it
has
left
an
empty
place
within
them
and
they
feel
it
common
need
to
fill
it
up
with
something
that
is
a
little
like
love
they
come
to
remember
that
there
are
other
children
in
the
world
on
whom
reckless
instinct
has
thrust
the
gift
of
life
neglected
children
stunted
and
maimed
in
mind
if
not
in
body
and
now
that
her
egoism
is
seared
to
the
quick
the
asserts
itself
in
rita
she
will
take
these
children
to
her
these
children
to
whom
her
hand
and
her
heart
have
hitherto
been
closed
they
shall
be
outwardly
in
eyolf
place
and
perhaps
in
time
they
may
fill
the
place
in
her
heart
that
should
have
been
eyolf
thus
she
will
try
to
make
her
peace
with
the
great
open
eyes
for
now
at
last
she
has
divined
the
secret
of
the
unwritten
book
on
human
responsibility
and
has
realised
that
motherhood
means
atonement
so
i
read
this
terrible
and
beautiful
work
of
art
this
i
think
is
meaning
inherent
in
it
not
perhaps
meaning
and
still
less
all
the
meanings
indeed
its
peculiar
fascination
for
me
among
all
works
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
touch
life
at
so
many
different
points
but
i
must
not
be
understood
as
implying
that
ibsen
constructed
the
play
with
any
such
definitely
allegoric
design
as
is
here
set
forth
i
do
not
believe
that
this
creator
of
men
and
women
ever
started
from
an
abstract
conception
he
did
not
first
compose
his
philosophic
tune
and
then
set
his
puppets
dancing
to
it
the
germ
in
his
mind
was
dramatic
not
ethical
it
was
only
as
the
drama
developed
that
its
meanings
dawned
upon
him
and
he
left
them
implicit
and
fragmentary
like
the
symbolism
of
life
itself
seldom
formulated
never
worked
out
with
schematic
precision
he
simply
took
a
cutting
from
the
tree
of
life
and
planting
it
in
the
rich
soil
of
his
imagination
let
it
ramify
and
burgeon
as
it
would
even
if
one
did
not
know
the
date
of
one
could
confidently
assign
it
to
the
latest
period
of
ibsen
career
on
noting
a
certain
difference
of
scale
between
its
foundations
and
its
superstructure
in
his
earlier
plays
down
to
and
including
we
feel
his
invention
at
work
to
the
very
last
moment
often
with
more
intensity
in
the
last
act
than
in
the
first
in
his
later
plays
he
seems
to
be
in
haste
to
pass
as
early
as
possible
from
invention
to
pure
analysis
in
this
play
after
the
death
of
eyolf
surely
one
of
the
most
inspired
situations
in
all
drama
there
is
practically
no
external
action
whatsoever
nothing
happens
save
in
the
souls
of
the
characters
there
is
no
further
invention
but
rather
what
one
may
perhaps
call
inquisition
this
does
not
prevent
the
second
act
from
being
quite
the
most
poignant
or
the
third
act
from
being
one
of
the
most
moving
that
ibsen
ever
wrote
far
from
wishing
to
depreciate
the
play
i
rate
it
more
highly
perhaps
than
most
critics
among
the
very
greatest
of
ibsen
achievements
i
merely
note
as
a
characteristic
of
the
poet
latest
manner
this
disparity
of
scale
between
the
work
foreshadowed
so
to
speak
and
the
work
completed
we
shall
find
it
still
more
evident

summer
dress
with
hat
jacket
and
parasol
under
her
arm
she
carries
a
locked
portfolio
of
considerable
size
she
is
slim
of
middle
height
with
dark
hair
and
deep
earnest
eyes
years
old
asta
as
she
enters
my
dear
rita
rita
turns
her
head
and
nods
to
her
what
is
that
you
asta
come
all
the
way
from
town
so
early
asta
takes
of
her
things
and
lays
them
on
a
chair
beside
the
door
yes
such
a
restless
feeling
came
over
me
i
felt
i
must
come
out
and
see
how
little
eyolf
was
getting
on
and
you
too
lays
the
portfolio
on
the
table
beside
the
sofa
so
i
took
the
steamer
and
here
i
am
rita
smiling
to
her
and
i
daresay
you
met
one
or
other
of
your
friends
on
board
quite
by
chance
of
course
asta
quietly
no
i
did
not
meet
a
soul
i
knew
sees
the
bag
why
rita
what
have
you
got
there
rita
still
unpacking
alfred
do
you
recognise
it
asta
joyfully
approaching
her
what
has
alfred
come
home
rita
yes
only
think
he
came
quite
unexpectedly
by
the
late
train
last
night
asta
oh
then
that
was
what
my
feeling
meant
it
was
that
that
drew
me
out
here
and
he
had
written
a
line
to
let
you
know
not
even
a
rita
not
a
single
word
asta
did
he
not
even
telegraph
rita
yes
an
hour
before
he
arrived
quite
curtly
and
coldly
laughs
do
you
think
that
was
like
him
asta
asta
yes
he
goes
so
quietly
about
everything
rita
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
delightful
to
have
him
again
asta
yes
i
am
sure
it
would
rita
a
whole
fortnight
before
i
expected
him
asta
and
is
he
quite
well
not
in
low
spirits
rita
closes
the
bag
with
a
snap
and
smiles
at
her
he
looked
quite
transfigured
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
asta
and
was
he
not
the
least
bit
tired
either
rita
oh
yes
he
seemed
to
be
tired
enough
very
tired
in
fact
but
poor
fellow
he
had
come
on
foot
the
greater
part
of
the
way
asta
and
then
perhaps
the
high
mountain
air
may
have
been
rather
too
keen
for
him
rita
oh
no
i
do
think
so
at
all
i
have
heard
him
cough
once
asta
ah
there
you
see
now
it
was
a
good
thing
after
all
that
the
doctor
talked
him
into
taking
this
tour
rita
yes
now
that
it
is
safely
but
i
can
tell
you
it
has
been
a
terrible
time
for
me
asta
i
have
never
cared
to
talk
about
it
and
you
so
seldom
came
out
to
see
me
too
asta
yes
i
daresay
that
was
very
nice
of
me
but
rita
well
well
well
of
course
you
had
your
school
to
attend
to
in
town
smiling
and
then
our
friend
of
course
he
was
away
too
asta
oh
do
talk
like
that
rita
rita
very
well
then
we
will
leave
the
out
of
the
you
ca
think
how
i
have
been
longing
for
alfred
how
empty
the
place
seemed
how
desolate
ugh
it
felt
as
if
there
had
been
a
funeral
in
the
house
asta
why
dear
me
only
six
or
seven
weeks
rita
yes
but
you
must
remember
that
alfred
has
never
been
away
from
me
before
never
so
much
as
hours
not
once
in
all
these
ten
years
asta
no
but
that
is
just
why
i
really
think
it
was
high
time
he
should
have
a
little
outing
this
year
he
ought
to
have
gone
for
a
tramp
in
the
mountains
every
summer
he
really
ought
rita
half
smiling
oh
yes
it
all
very
well
fair
you
to
talk
if
i
were
as
as
reasonable
its
you
i
suppose
i
should
have
let
him
go
before
perhaps
but
i
positively
could
not
asta
it
seemed
to
me
i
should
never
get
him
back
again
surely
you
can
understand
that
asta
no
but
i
daresay
that
is
because
i
have
no
one
to
lose
rita
with
a
teasing
smile
really
no
one
at
all
asta
not
that
know
of
changing
the
subject
but
tell
me
rita
where
is
alfred
is
he
still
asleep
rita
oh
not
at
all
he
got
up
as
early
as
ever
asta
then
he
ca
have
been
so
very
tired
after
all
rita
yes
he
was
last
night
when
he
arrived
but
now
he
has
had
little
eyolf
with
him
in
his
room
for
a
whole
hour
and
more
asta
poor
little
boy
has
he
to
be
for
ever
at
his
lessons
again
rita
with
a
slight
shrug
alfred
will
have
it
so
you
know
asta
yes
but
i
think
you
ought
to
put
down
your
foot
about
it
rita
rita
somewhat
impatiently
oh
no
come
now
i
really
can
not
meddle
with
that
alfred
knows
so
much
better
about
these
things
than
i
do
and
what
would
you
have
eyolf
do
he
ca
run
about
and
play
you
see
like
other
children
asta
with
decision
i
will
talk
to
alfred
about
this
rita
yes
do
i
wish
you
oh
here
he
is
alfred
allmers
dressed
in
light
summer
clothes
enters
by
the
door
on
the
left
leading
eyolf
by
the
hand
he
is
a
slim
man
of
about
or
with
gentle
eyes
and
thin
brown
hair
and
beard
his
expression
is
serious
and
thoughtful
eyolf
wears
a
suit
cut
like
a
uniform
with
gold
braid
and
gilt
military
buttons
he
is
lame
and
walks
with
a
crutch
under
his
left
arm
his
leg
is
shrunken
he
is
undersized
and
looks
delicate
but
has
beautiful
intelligent
eyes
allmers
drops
eyolf
hand
goes
up
to
asta
with
an
expression
of
marked
pleasure
and
holds
out
both
his
hands
to
her
asta
my
dearest
asta
to
think
of
your
coming
to
think
of
my
seeing
you
so
soon
asta
i
felt
i
must
welcome
home
again
allmers
shaking
her
hands
thank
you
for
coming
rita
does
he
look
well
asta
gazes
fixedly
at
him
splendid
quite
splendid
his
eyes
are
so
much
brighter
and
i
suppose
you
have
done
a
great
deal
of
writing
on
your
travels
with
an
outburst
of
joy
i
should
wonder
if
you
had
finished
the
whole
book
alfred
allmers
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
book
oh
the
book
asta
yes
i
was
sure
you
would
find
it
go
so
easily
when
once
you
got
away
allmers
so
i
thought
too
but
do
you
know
i
did
find
it
so
at
all
the
truth
is
i
have
not
written
a
line
of
the
book
asta
not
a
line
rita
oho
i
wondered
when
i
found
all
the
paper
lying
untouched
in
your
bag
asta
but
my
dear
alfred
what
have
you
been
doing
all
this
time
allmers
smiling
only
thinking
and
thinking
and
thinking
rita
putting
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
thinking
a
little
too
of
those
you
had
left
at
home
allmers
yes
you
may
be
sure
of
that
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
of
you
every
single
day
rita
taking
her
arm
away
ah
that
is
all
i
care
about
asta
but
you
have
even
touched
the
book
and
yet
you
can
look
so
happy
and
contented
that
is
not
what
you
generally
do
i
mean
when
your
work
is
going
badly
allmers
you
are
right
there
you
see
i
have
been
such
a
fool
hitherto
all
the
best
that
is
in
you
goes
into
thinking
what
you
put
on
paper
is
worth
very
little
asta
exclaiming
worth
very
little
rita
laughing
what
an
absurd
thing
to
say
alfred
eyolf
looks
confidingly
up
at
him
oh
yes
papa
what
you
write
is
worth
a
great
deal
allmers
smiling
and
stroking
his
hair
well
well
since
you
say
but
i
can
tell
you
some
one
is
coming
after
me
who
will
do
it
better
eyolf
who
can
that
be
oh
tell
me
allmers
only
wait

may
be
sure
he
will
come
and
let
us

of
him

allmers
seriously
then
i
will
go
to
the
mountains

shame
up
to
the
peaks
and
the
great
waste
places
eyolf

think
i
shall
soon
be
well
enough
for
you
to
take
me
with
you
allmers
with
painful
emotion
oh
yes
perhaps
my
little
boy
eyolf
it
would
be
so
splendid
you
know
if
i
could
climb
the
mountains
like
you
asta
changing
the
subject
why

beautifully
you

rita
in
a
low
voice

has
teased
me
so
long
about
them
he
had
set
his
heart
on

he
gave
me
no
peace

and
i
forgot
to
tell
you

bought

a
new
bow

him
in
his
arms
you

soldier
allmers
oh
little

other
things
that

better
than
that
eyolf
ah
but
when
i
grow
big
then
i
shall
have
to
be
a
soldier
you
know
that
do
you

allmers
i
saw
her
too
somewhere
up
in
the

sitting
on
the
sofa
perhaps
it
will
be
out
turn
to
see
her
next
eyolf
eyolf
auntie
is
it
strange
that
she
should
be
called
the
asta
oh
people
just
give
her
that
name
because
she
wanders
round
the
country
driving
away
all
the
rats
allmers
i
have
heard
that
her
real
name
is
varg
eyolf
varg
that
means
a
wolf
does
it
allmers
patting
him
on
the
head
so
you
know
that
do
you
eyolf
cautiously
then
perhaps
it
may
be
true
after
all
that
she
is
a
at
night
do
you
believe
that
papa
allmers
oh
no
i
do
believe
it
now
you

to
go

a
little
in
the
garden
eyolf
should
i
not
take
some
books
with
me
allmers
no
no

other
boys
eyolf
shyly
no
papa
i
wo
go
down
to
the
boys
allmers
why

eyolf
oh
because

make
fun
of
of
your
pretty
clothes
eyolf
evasively
no

for
then
i
would
thrash
them
allmers
aha
then
why
eyolf
you
see
they
are
so
naughty
these
boys
and
then
they
say
i
can
never
be
a
soldier
allmers
with
suppressed
indignation
why
do
they
say
that
do
you
think
eyolf
i
suppose
they
are
jealous
of
me
for
you
know
papa
they
are
so
poor
they
have
to
go
about
barefoot
allmers
softly
with
choking
voice
oh

how
it
wrings
my
heart
rita
soothingly
rising
there
there
there
allmers
threateningly
but
these
rascals

with
keen
piercing
eyes
dressed
in

flowered

with
a
black
hood
and
cloak

has
in

by
a
loop
over
her

bit
but
there

sour
apple

at
eyolf
and
nods
the
sour
apple

involuntarily
a

timidly

pittering
and
pattering
all
over

backwards
and
forwards
and
up
and
down
eyolf
softly
to

the
closing
the
bag
oh
it
will
come
it
will
come
right
enough
eyolf
involuntarily
drawing
nearer
at
last
goes
right
up
to
her
and
strokes
the
bag
but
he
is
lovely
lovely
all
the
same
the
in
a
tone
of
caution
but
now
he
is
so
tired
and
weary
poor
thing
he
utterly
tired
out
he
is
looks
at
allmers
for
it
takes
the
strength
out
of
you
that
sort
of
game
i
can
tell
you
sir
allmers
what
sort
of
game
do
you
mean
the
the
luring
game
allmers
do
you
mean
that
it
is
the
dog
that
lures
the
rats
the
nodding
mopsëman
and
i
we
two
do
it
together
and
it
goes
so
smoothly
for
all
you
can
see
at
any
rate
i
just
slip
a
string
through
his
collar
and
then
i
lead
him
three
times
round
the
house
and
play
on
my
when
they
hear
that
they
have
got
to
come
up
from
the
cellars
and
down
from
the
garrets
and
out
of
flour
boles
all
the
blessed
little
creatures
eyolf
and
does
he
bite
them
to
death
then
the
oh
not
at
all
no
we
go
down
to
the
boat
he
and
i
do
and
then
they
follow
after
us
both
the
big
ones
and
the
little
ratikins
eyolf
eagerly
and
what
then
tell
me
the
then
we
push
out
from
the
land
and
i
scull
with
one
oar
and
play
on
my
and
mopsëman
he
swims
behind
with
glittering
eyes
and
all
the
creepers
and
crawlers
they
follow
and
follow
us
out
into
the
deep
deep
waters
ay
for
they
have
to
eyolf
why
do
they
have
to
the
just
because
they
want
not
to
just
because
they
are
so
deadly
afraid
of
the
water
that
is
why
they
have
got
to
plunge
into
it
eyolf
are
they
drowned
then
the
every
blessed
one
more
softly
and
there
it
is
all
as
still
and
soft
and
dark
as
their
hearts
can
desire
the
lovely
little
things
down
there
they
sleep
a
long
sweet
sleep
with
no
one
to
hate
them
or
persecute
them
any
more
rises
in
the
old
days
i
can
tell
you
i
did
need
any
mopsëman
then
i
did
the
luring
myself
i
alone
eyolf
and
what
did
you
lure
then
the
men
one
most
of
all
eyolf
with
eagerness
oh
who
was
that
one
tell
me
the
laughing
it
was
my
own
sweetheart
it
was
little
eyolf
and
where
is
he
now
then
the
harshly
down
where
all
the
rats
are
resuming
her
milder
tone
but
now
i
must
be
off
and
get
to
business
again
always
on
the
move
to
rita
so
your
ladyship
has
no
sort
of
use
for
me
i
could
finish
it
all
off
while
i
am
about
it
rita
no
thank
you
i
do
think
we
require
anything
the
well
well
your
sweet
ladyship
you
can
never
tell
if
your
ladyship
should
find
that
there
is
anything
lure
that
keeps
nibbling
and
gnawing
and
creeping
and
crawling
then
just
see
and
get
hold
of
me
and
a
kind
to
you
all
she
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
right
eyolf
softly
and
triumphantly
to
asta
only
think
auntie
now
i
have
seen
the
too
rita
goes
out
upon
the
verandah
and
fans
herself
with

shortly
afterwards
eyolf
slips
cautiously
and
unnoticed
out
to
the
right

portfolio

her
on
the
head
and
you
have
actually
found
time
to
do
that
dear
asta
oh
yes
i
have
done
it
partly
out
here
and
partly
at
my
own
rooms
in
town
allmers
thanks
dear
did
you
find
anything
particular
in
them
asta
lightly
oh
you
know
you
always
find
something
or
other
in
such
old
papers
speaking
lower
and
seriously
it
is
the
letters
to
mother
that
are
in
this
portfolio
allmers
those
of
course
you
must
keep
yourself
asta
with
an
effort
no
i
am
determined
that
you
shall
look
through
them
too
alfred
some
time
later
on
in
life
i
have
the
key
of
the
portfolio
with
me
just
now
allmers
it
does
matter
my
dear
asta
for
i
shall
never
read
your
mother
letters
in
any
case
asta
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
then
some
time
or
other
some
quiet
evening
i
will
tell
you
a
little
of
what
is
in
them
allmers
yes
that
will
be
much
better
but
do
you
keep
your
letters

have
so
many
mementos
of
her
he
hands
asta
the
portfolio
she
takes
it
and
lays
it
on
the
chair
under
her
outdoor
things
rita
comes
into
the
room
again
rita
ugh
i
feel
as
if
that
horrible
old
woman
had
brought
a
sort
of
graveyard
smell
with
her
allmers
yes
she
was
rather
horrible
rita
i
felt
almost
sick
while
she
was
in
the
room
allmers
however
i
can
very
well
understand
the
sort
of
spellbound
fascination
that
she
talked
about
the
loneliness
of
the
and
of
the
great
waste
places
has
something
of
the
same
magic
about
it
asta
looks
attentively
at
him
what
is
it
that
has
happened
to
you
alfred
allmers
smiling
to
me
asta
yes
something
has
happened
something
seems
almost
to
have
transformed
you
rita
noticed
it
too
rita
yes
i
saw
it
the
moment
you
came
a
change
for
the
better
i
hope
alfred
allmers
it
ought
to
be
for
the
better
and
it
must
and
shall
come
to
good
rita
with
an
outburst
you
have
had
some
adventure
on
your
journey
do
deny
it
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
allmers
shaking
his
head
no
adventure
in
the
world
outwardly
at
least
but
rita
eagerly
but
allmers
it
is
true
that
within
me
there
has
been
something
of
a
revolution
rita
oh
heavens
allmers
soothingly
patting
her
hand
only
for
the
better
my
dear
rita
you
may
be
perfectly
certain
of
that
rita
seats
herself
on
the
sofa
you
must
tell
us
all
about
it
at
once
tell
us
everything
allmers
turning
to
asta
yes
let
us
sit
down
too
asta
then
i
will
try
to
tell
you
as
well
as
i
can
he
seats
himself
on
the
sofa
at
rita
side
asta
moves
a
chair
forward
and
places
herself
near
him
rita
looking
at
him
expectantly
well
allmers
gazing
straight
before
him
when
i
look
back
over
my
life
and
my
fortunes
for
the
last
ten
or
eleven
years
it
seems
to
me
almost
like
a
or
a
dream
do
you
think
so
too
asta
asta
yes
in
many
ways
i
think
so
allmers
continuing
when
i
remember
what
we
two
used
to
be
asta
we
two
poor
orphan
children
rita
impatiently
oh
that
is
such
an
old
old
story
allmers
not
listening
to
her
and
now
here
i
am
in
comfort
and
luxury
i
have
been
able
to
follow
my
vocation
i
have
been
able
to
work
and
study
just
as
i
had
always
longed
to
holds
out
his
hand
and
all
this
great
this
fabulous
good
fortune
we
owe
to
you
my
dearest
rita
rita
half
playfully
half
angrily
slaps
his
hand
oh
i
do
wish
you
would
stop
talking
like
that
allmers
i
speak
of
it
only
as
a
sort
of
introduction
rita
then
do
skip
the
introduction
allmers
rita
you
must
not
think
it
was
the
doctor
advice
that
drove
me
up
to
the
mountains
asta
was
it
not
alfred
rita
what
was
it
then
allmers
it
was
this
i
found
there
was
no
more
peace
for
me
there
in
my
study
rita
no
peace
why
who
disturbed
you
allmers
shaking
his
head
no
one
from
without
but
i
felt
as
though
i
were
positively
abusing
or
say
rather
wasting
my
best
powers
frittering
away
the
time
asta
with
wide
eyes
when
you
were
writing
at
your
book
allmers
nodding
for
i
can
not
think
that
my
powers
are
confined
to
that
alone
i
must
surely
have
it
in
me
to
do
one
or
two
other
things
as
well
rita
was
that
what
you
sat
there
brooding
over
allmers
yes
mainly
that
rita
and
so
that
is
what
has
made
you
so
discontented
with
yourself
of
late
and
with
the
rest
of
us
as
well
for
you
know
you
were
discontented
alfred
allmers
gazing
straight
before
him
there
i
sat
bent
over
my
table
day
after
day
and
often
half
the
night
too
writing
and
writing
at
the
great
thick
book
on
human
responsibility
h
asta
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
but
alfred
that
book
is
to
be
your
rita
yes
you
have
said
so
often
enough
allmers
i
thought
so
ever
since
i
grew
up
i
have
thought
so
with
an
affectionate
expression
in
his
eyes
and
it
was
you
that
enabled
me
to
devote
myself
to
it
my
dear
rita
rita
oh
nonsense
allmers
smiling
to
her
you
with
your
gold
and
your
green
forests
rita
half
laughing
half
vexed
if
you
begin
all
that
rubbish
again
i
shall
beat
you
asta
looking
sorrowfully
at
him
but
the
book
alfred
allmers
it
began
as
it
were
to
drift
away
from
me
but
i
was
more
and
more
beset
by
the
thought
of
the
higher
duties
that
laid
their
claims
upon
me
rita
beaming
seizes
his
hand
alfred
allmers
the
thought
of
eyolf
my
dear
rita
rita
disappointed
drops
his
hand
ah
of
eyolf
allmers
poor
little
eyolf
has
taken
deeper
and
deeper
hold
of
me
after
that
unlucky
fall
from
the
table
and
especially
since
we
have
been
assured
that
the
injury
is
incurable
rita
insistently
but
you
take
all
the
care
you
possibly
can
of
him
alfred
allmers
as
a
schoolmaster
yes
but
not
as
a
father
and
it
is
a
father
that
i
want
henceforth
to
be
to
eyolf
rita
looking
at
him
and
shaking
her
head
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
you
allmers
i
mean
that
i
will
try
with
all
my
might
to
make
his
misfortune
as
painless
and
easy
to
him
as
it
can
possibly
be
rita
oh
but
dear
thank
heaven
i
do
think
he
feels
it
so
deeply
asta
with
emotion
yes
rita
he
does
allmers
yes
you
may
be
sure
he
feels
it
deeply
rita
impatiently
but
alfred
what
more
can
you
do
for
him
allmers
i
will
try
to
perfect
all
the
rich
possibilities
that
are
dawning
in
his
childish
soul
i
will
foster
all
the
germs
of
good
in
his
nature
make
them
blossom
and
bear
fruit
with
more
and
more
warmth
rising
and
i
will
do
more
than
that
i
will
help
him
to
bring
his
desires
into
harmony
with
what
lies
attainable
before
him
that
is
just
what
at
present
they
are
not
all
his
longings
are
for
things
that
must
for
ever
remain
unattainable
to
him
but
i
will
create
a
conscious
happiness
in
his
mind
he
goes
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
room
asta
and
rita
follow
him
with
their
eyes
rita
you
should
take
these
things
more
quietly
alfred
allmers
stops
beside
the
table
on
the
left
and
looks
at
them
eyolf
shall
carry
on
my
if
he
wants
to
or
he
shall
choose
one
that
is
altogether
his
own
perhaps
that
would
be
best
at
all
events
i
shall
let
mine
rest
as
it
is
rita
rising
but
alfred
dear
can
you
not
work
both
for
yourself
and
for
eyolf
allmers
no
i
can
not
it
is
impossible
i
can
not
divide
myself
in
this
matter
and
therefore
i
efface
myself
eyolf
shall
be
the
complete
man
of
our
race
and
it
shall
be
my
new
to
make
him
the
complete
man
asta
has
risen
and
now
goes
up
to
him
this
must
have
cost
you
a
terribly
hard
struggle
alfred
allmers
yes
it
has
at
home
here
i
should
never
have
conquered
myself
never
brought
myself
to
the
point
of
renunciation
never
at
home
rita
then
that
was
why
you
went
away
this
summer
allmers
with
shining
eyes
yes
i
went
up
into
the
infinite
solitudes
i
saw
the
sunrise
gleaming
on
the
mountain
peaks
i
felt
myself
nearer
the
stars
i
seemed
almost
to
be
in
sympathy
and
communion
with
them
and
then
i
found
the
strength
for
it
asta
looking
sadly
at
him
but
you
will
never
write
any
more
of
your
book
on
human
responsibility
allmers
no
never
asta
i
tell
you
i
can
not
split
up
my
life
between
two
vocations
but
i
will
act
out
my
human
responsibility
in
my
own
life
rita
with
a
smile
do
you
think
you
can
live
up
to
such
high
resolves
at
home
here
allmers
taking
her
hand
with
you
to
help
me
i
can
holds
out
the
other
hand
and
with
you
too
asta
rita
drawing
her
hand
away
ah
with
both
of
us
so
after
all
you
can
divide
yourself
allmers
why
my
dearest
rita

away
from

thinking
of
all
the
bright
and
hopeful
prospects
that
are
opening
out
before
me
rita
aha
then
perhaps
you
have
something
still
more
exquisite
in
reserve
borgheim
glancing
towards
asta
who
knows
when
once
happiness
comes
to
us
it
is
apt
to
come
like
it
spring
flood
turns
to
asta
miss
allmers
would
you
not
like
to
take
a
little
walk
with
me
as
we
used
to
asta
quickly
no
no
thank
you
not
now
not
borgheim
oh
do
come
only
a
little
bit
of
a
walk
i
have
so
much
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
before
i
go
rita
something
else
perhaps
that
you
must
not
talk
openly
about
as
yet
borgheim
h
that
depends
rita
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
your
whispering
you
know
half
aside
asta
you
must
really
go
with
him
asta
but
my
dear
rita
borgheim
imploringly
miss
asta
remember
it
is
to
be
a
farewell
walk
the
last
for
many
a
day
asta
takes
her
hat
and
parasol
very
well
suppose
we
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
then
borgheim
oh
thank
you
thank
you
allmers
and
while
you
are
there
you
can
see
what
eyolf
is
doing
borgheim
ah
eyolf
by
the
bye
where
is
eyolf
i
got
something
for
him
allmers
he
is
out
playing
somewhere
borgheim
is
he
really
then
he
has
begun
to
play
now
he
used
always
to
be
sitting
indoors
over
his
books
allmers
there
is
to
be
an
end
of
that
now
i
am
going
to
make
a
regular
boy
of
him
borgheim
ah
now
that
right
out
into
the
open
air
with
him
poor
little
fellow
good
lord
what
can
we
possibly
do
better
than
play
in
this
blessed
world
for
my
part
i
think
all
life
is
one
long
playtime
come
miss
asta
borgheim
and
asta
go
out
on
the
verandah
and
down
through
the
garden
allmers
stands
looking
after
them
rita
do
you
think
there
is
anything
between
those
two
rita
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
used
to
think
there
was
but
asta
has
grown
so
strange
to
me
so
utterly
incomprehensible
of
late
allmers
indeed
has
she
while
i
have
been
away
rita
yes
within
the
last
week
or
two
allmers
and
you
think
she
does
care
very
much
about
him
now
rita
not
seriously
not
utterly
and
entirely
not
unreservedly
i
am
sure
she
does
looks
searchingly
at
him
would
it
displease
you
if
she
did
allmers
it
would
not
exactly
displease
me
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
disquieting
thought
rita
disquieting
allmers
yes
you
must
remember
that
i
am
responsible
for
asta
for
her
life
happiness
rita
oh
come
responsible
surely
asta
has
come
to
years
of
discretion
i
should
say
she
was
capable
of
choosing
for
herself
allmers
yes
we
must
hope
so
rita
rita
for
my
part
i
do
think
at
all
ill
of
borgheim
allmers
no
dear
no
more
do
i
quite
the
contrary
but
all
the
same
rita
continuing
and
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
if
he
and
asta
were
to
make
a
match
of
it
allmers
annoyed
oh
why
should
you
be
rita
with
increasing
excitement
why
for
then
she
would
have
to
go
far
far
away
with
him
anal
she
could
never
come
out
here
to
us
as
she
does
now
allmers
stares
at
her
in
astonishment
what
can
you
really
wish
asta
to
go
away
rita
yes
yes
alfred
allmers
why
in
all
the
world
rita
throwing
her
arms
passionately
round
his
neck
for
then
at
last
i
should
have
you
to
myself
alone
and
yet
not
even
then
not
wholly
to
myself
bursts
into
convulsive
weeping
oh
alfred
alfred
i
can
not
give
you
up
allmers
gently
releasing
himself
my
dearest
rita
do
be
reasonable
rita
i
do
care
a
bit
about
being
reasonable
i
care
only
for
you
only
for
you
in
all
the
world
again
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
for
you
for
you
for
you
allmers
let
me
go
let
me
go
you
are
strangling
me
rita
letting
him
go
how
i
wish
i
could
looking
at
him
with
flashing
eyes
oh
if
you
knew
how
i
have
hated
you
allmers
hated
me
rita
yes
when
you
shut
yourself
up
in
your
room
and
brooded
over
your
work
till
long
long
into
the
night
plaintively
so
long
so
late
alfred
oh
how
i
hated
your
work
allmers
but
now
i
have
done
with
that
rita
with
a
cutting
laugh
oh
yes
now
you
have
given
yourself
up
to
something
worse
allmers
shocked
worse
do
you
call
our
child
something
worse
rita
vehemently
yes
i
do
as
he
comes
between
you
and
me
i
call
him
so
for
the
book
the
book
was
not
a
living
being
as
the
child
is
with
increasing
impetuosity
but
i
wo
endure
it
alfred
i
will
not
endure
it
i
tell
you
so
plainly
allmers
looks
steadily
at
her
and
says
in
a
low
voice
i
am
often
almost
afraid
of
you
rita
rita
gloomily
i
am
often
afraid
of
myself
and
for
that
very
reason
you
must
not
awake
the
evil
in
me
allmers
why
good
heavens
do
i
do
that
rita
yes
you
do
when
you
tear
to
shreds
the
holiest
bonds
between
us
allmers
urgently
think
what
you
saying
rita
it
is
your
own
child
our
only
child
that
you
are
speaking
of
rita
the
child
is
only
half
mine
with
another
outburst
but
you
shall
be
mine
alone
you
shall
be
wholly
mine
that
i
have
a
right
to
demand
of
you
allmers
shrugging
his
shoulders
oh
my
dear
rita
it
is
of
no
use
demanding
anything
everything
must
be
freely
given
rita
looks
anxiously
at
him
and
that
you
can
not
do
henceforth
allmers
no
i
can
not
i
must
divide
myself
between
eyolf
and
you
rita
but
if
eyolf
had
never
been
born
what
then
allmers
evasively
oh
that
would
be
another
matter
then
i
should
have
only
you
to
care
for
rita
softly
her
voice
quivering
then
i
wish
he
had
never
been
born
allmers
flashing
out
rita
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
rita
trembling
with
emotion
it
was
in
pain
unspeakable
that
i
brought
him
into
the
world
but
i
bore
it
all
with
joy
and
rapture
for
your
sake
allmers
warmly
oh
yes
i
know
i
know
rita
with
decision
but
there
it
must
end
i
will
live
my
life
together
with
you
wholly
with
you
i
can
not
go
on
being
only
eyolf
mother
only
his
mother
and
nothing
more
i
will
not
i
tell
you
i
can
not
i
will
be
all
in
all
to
you
to
you
alfred
allmers
but
that
is
just
what
you
are
rita
through
our
child
rita
oh
vapid
nauseous
phrases
nothing
else
no
alfred
i
am
not
to
be
put
off
like
that
i
was
fitted
to
become
the
child
mother
but
not
to
be
a
mother
to
him
you
must
take
me
as
i
am
alfred
allmers
and
yet
you
used
to
be
so
fond
of
eyolf
rita
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
because
you
troubled
yourself
so
little
about
him
you
kept
him
reading
and
grinding
at
books
you
scarcely
even
saw
him
allmers
nodding
slowly
no
i
was
blind
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
me
rita
looking
in
his
face
but
now
i
suppose
it
has
come
allmers
yes
at
last
now
i
see
that
the
highest
task
i
can
have
in
the
world
is
to
be
a
true
father
to
eyolf
rita
and
to
me
what
will
you
be
to
me
allmers
gently
i
will
always
go
on
caring
for
you
with
calm
deep
tenderness
he
tries
to
take
her
hands
rita
evading
him
i
do
care
a
bit
for
your
calm
deep
tenderness
i
want
you
utterly
and
entirely
and
alone
just
as
i
had
you
in
the
first
rich
beautiful
days
vehemently
and
harshly
never
never
will
i
consent
to
be
put
off
with
scraps
and
leavings
alfred
allmers
in
a
conciliatory
tone
i
should
have
thought
there
was
happiness
in
plenty
for
all
three
of
us
rita
rita
scornfully
then
you
are
easy
to
please
seats
herself
at
the
table
on
the
left
now
listen
to
me
allmers
approaching
well
what
is
it
rita
looking
up
at
him
with
a
veiled
glow
in
her
eyes
when
i
got
your
telegram
yesterday
evening
allmers
yes
what
then
then
i
dressed
myself
in
white
allmers
yes
i
noticed
you
were
in
white
when
i
arrived
rita
i
had
let
down
my
hair
allmers
your
sweet
masses
of
hair
so
that
it
flowed
down
my
neck
and
shoulders
allmers
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
oh
how
lovely
you
were
rita
rita
there
were
shades
over
both
the
lamps
and
we
were
alone
we
two
the
only
waking
beings
in
the
whole
house
and
there
was
champagne
on
the
table
allmers
i
did
not
drink
any
of
it
rita
looking
bitterly
at
him
no
that
is
true
laughs
harshly
there
stood
the
champagne
but
you
tasted
it
not
as
the
poet
says
she
rises
from
the
armchair
goes
with
an
air
of
weariness
over
to
the
sofa
and
seats
herself
half
reclining
upon
it
allmers
crosses
the
room
and
stands
before
her
i
was
so
taken
up
with
serious
thoughts
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
talk
to
you
of
our
future
rita
and
first
and
foremost
of
eyolf
rita
smiling
and
so
you
did
allmers
no
i
had
not
time
to
for
you
began
to
undress
rita
yes
and
meanwhile
you
talked
about
eyolf
do
you
remember
you
wanted
to
know
all
about
little
eyolf
digestion
allmers
looking
reproachfully
at
her
rita
rita
and
then
you
got
into
your
bed
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
allmers
shaking
his
head
rita
rita
rita
lying
at
full
length
and
looking
up
at
him
alfred
allmers
yes
rita
there
stood
your
champagne
but
you
tasted
it
not
allmers
almost
harshly
no
i
did
not
taste
it
he
goes
away
from
her
and
stands
in
the
garden
doorway
rita
lies
for
some
time
motionless
with
closed
eyes
rita
suddenly
springing
up
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
alfred
allmers
turning
in
the
doorway
well
rita
you
ought
not
to
feel
quite
so
secure
as
you
do
allmers
not
secure
rita
no
you
ought
not
to
be
so
indifferent
not
certain
of
your
property
in
me
allmers
drawing
nearer
what
do
you
mean
by
that
rita
with
trembling
lips
never
in
a
single
thought
have
i
been
untrue
to
you
alfred
never
for
an
instant
allmers
no
rita
i
know
that
i
who
know
you
so
well
rita
with
sparkling
eyes
but
if
you
disdain
me
allmers
disdain
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
rita
oh
you
do
know
all
that
might
rise
up
within
me
if
allmers
if
rita
if
i
should
ever
see
that
you
did
not
care
for
me
that
you
did
not
love
me
as
you
used
to
allmers
but
my
dearest
rita
years
bring
a
certain
change
with
them
and
that
must
one
day
occur
even
in
us
as
in
every
one
else
rita
never
in
me
and
i
will
not
hear
of
any
change
in
you
either
i
could
not
bear
it
alfred
i
want
to
keep
you
to
myself
alone
allmers
looking
at
her
with
concern
you
have
a
terribly
jealous
nature
rita
i
ca
make
myself
different
from
what
i
am
threateningly
if
you
go
and
divide
yourself
between
me
and
any
one
else
allmers
what
then
rita
then
i
will
take
my
revenge
on
you
alfred
allmers
how
take
your
revenge
rita
i
do
know
oh
yes
i
do
know
well
enough
allmers
well
rita
i
will
go
and
throw
myself
away
allmers
throw
yourself
away
do
you
say
rita
yes
that
i
will
i
throw
myself
straight
into
the
arms
of
of
the
first
man
that
comes
in
my
way
allmers
looking
tenderly
at
her
and
shaking
his
head
that
you
will
never
do
my
loyal
proud
rita
rita
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
oh
you
do
know
what
i
might
come
to
be
if
you
if
you
did
not
love
me
any
more
allmers
did
not
love
you
rita
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
rita
half
laughing
lets
him
go
why
should
i
not
spread
my
nets
for
that
that
man
that
hangs
about
here
allmers
relieved
oh
thank
goodness
you
are
only
joking
rita
not
at
all
he
would
do
as
well
as
any
one
else
allmers
ah
but
i
suspect
he
is
more
or
less
taken
up
already
rita
so
much
the
better
for
then
i
should
take
him
away
from
some
one
else
and
that
is
just
what
eyolf
has
done
to
me
allmers
can
you
say
that
our
little
eyolf
has
done
that
rita
pointing
with
her
forefinger
there
you
see
you
see
the
moment
you
mention
eyolf
name
you
grow
tender
and
your
voice
quivers
threateningly
clenching
her
hands
oh
you
almost
tempt
we
to
wish
allmers
looking
at
her
anxiously
what

tempt
you
to
wish

a
life
he
rushes
down
through
the
garden
act
second
a
little
narrow
glen
by
the
side
of
the
fiord
on
allmers
property
on
the
left
lofty
old
trees
overarch
the
spot
down
the
slope
in
the
background
a
brook
comes
leaping
and
loses
itself
among
the
stones
on
the
margin
of
the
wood
a
path
winds
along
by
the
to
the
right
there
are
only
a
few
single
trees
between
which
the
fiord
is
visible
in
front
is
seen
the
corner
of
a
with
a
boat
drawn
up
under
the
old
trees
on
the
left
stands
a
table
with
a
bench
and
one
or
two
chairs
all
made
of
thin
it
is
a
heavy
damp
day
with
driving
mist
wreaths
alfred
allmers
dressed
as
before
sits
on
the
bench
leaning
his
arms
on
the
table
his
hat
lies
before
him
he
gazes
absently
and
immovably
out
over
the
water
presently
asta
allmers
comes
down
the
woodpath
she
is
carrying
an
open
umbrella
asta
goes
quietly
and
cautiously
up
to
him
you
ought
not
to
sit
down
here
in
this
gloomy
weather
alfred
allmers
nods
slowly
without
answering
asta
closing
her
umbrella
i
have
been
searching
for
you
such
a
long
time
allmers
without
expression
thank
you
asta
moves
a
chair
and
seats
herself
close
to
him
have
you
been
sitting
here
long
all
the
time
allmers
does
not
answer
at
first
presently
he
says
no
i
can
not
grasp
it
it
seems
so
utterly
impossible
asta
laying
her
hand
compassionately
on
his
arm
poor
alfred
allmers
gazing
at
her
is
it
really
true
then
asta
or
have
i
gone
mad
or
am
i
only
dreaming
oh
if
it
were
only
a
dream
just
think
if
i
were
to
waken
now
asta
oh
if
i
could
only
waken
you
allmers
looking
out
over
the
water
how
pitiless
the
fiord
looks
lying
so
heavy
and
drowsy
with
splashes
of
yellow
and
reflecting
the
asta
imploringly
oh
alfred
do
sit
staring
out
over
the
fiord
allmers
not
heeding
her
over
the
surface
yes
but
in
the
depths
there
sweeps
the
rushing
undertow
asta
in
terror
oh
for
god
sake
do
think
of
the
depths
allmers
looking
gently
at
her
i
suppose
you
think
he
is
lying
close
outside
here
but
he
is
not
asta
you
must
not
think
that
you
must
remember
how
fiercely
the
current
sweeps
gut
here
straight
to
the
open
sea
asta
throws
herself
forward
against
the
table
and
sobbing
buries
her
face
in
her
hands
oh
god
oh
god
allmers
heavily
so
you
see
little
eyolf
has
passed
so
far
far
away
from
us
now
asta
looks
imploringly
up
at
him
oh
alfred
do
say
such
things
allmers
why
you
can
reckon
it
out
for
yourself
you
that
are
so
clever
in
hours
hours
let
me
see
let
me
see
asta
shrieking
and
stopping
her
ears
alfred
allmers
clenching
his
hand
firmly
upon
the
table
can
you
conceive
the
meaning
of
a
thing
like
this
asta
looks
at
him
of
what
allmers
of
this
that
has
been
done
to
rita
and
me
asta
the
meaning
of
it
allmers
impatiently
yes
the
meaning
i
say
for
after
all
there
must
be
a
meaning
in
it
life
existence
destiny
can
not
be
so
utterly
meaningless
asta
oh
who
can
say
anything
with
certainty
about
these
things
my
dear
alfred
allmers
laughs
bitterly
no
no
i
believe
you
are
right
there
perhaps
the
whole
thing
goes
simply
by
taking
its
own
course
like
a
drifting
wreck
without
a
rudder
i
daresay
that
is
how
it
is
at
least
it
seems
very
like
it
asta
thoughtfully
what
if
it
only
seems
allmers
vehemently
ah
perhaps
you
can
unravel
the
mystery
for
me
i
certainly
can
not
more
gently
here
is
eyolf
just
entering
upon
conscious
life
full
of
such
infinite
possibilities
splendid
possibilities
perhaps
he
would
have
filled
my
life
with
pride
and
gladness
and
then
a
crazy
old
woman
has
only
to
come
this
way
and
show
a
cur
in
a
bag
asta
but
we
do
in
the
least
know
how
it
really
happened
allmers
yes
we
do
the
boys
saw
her
row
out
over
the
fiord
they
saw
eyolf
standing
alone
at
the
very
end
of
the
pier
they
saw
him
gazing
after
her
and
then
he
seemed
to
turn
giddy
quivering
and
that
was
how
he
fell
over
and
disappeared
asta
yes
yes
but
all
the
same
allmers
she
has
drawn
him
down
into
the
depths
that
you
may
be
sure
of
dear
asta
but
alfred
why
should
she
allmers
yes
that
is
just
the
question
why
should
she
there
is
no
retribution
behind
it
all
no
atonement
i
mean
eyolf
never
did
her
any
harm
he
never
called
names
after
her
he
never
threw
stones
at
her
dog
why
he
had
never
set
eyes
either
on
her
or
her
dog
till
yesterday
so
there
is
no
retribution
the
whole
thing
is
utterly
groundless
and
meaningless
and
yet
the
order
of
the
world
requires
it
asta
have
you
spoken
to
rita
of
these
things
allmers
shakes
his
head
i
feel
as
if
i
can
talk
better
to
you
about
them
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
about
everything
else
as
well
asta
takes
and
a
little
paper
parcel
out
of
her
pocket
allmers
sits
looking
on
absently
allmers
what
leave
you
got
there
asta
asta
taking
his
hat
some
black
crap
allmers
oh
whet
is
the
use
of
that
asta
rita
asked
me
to
put
it
on
may
i
allmers
oh
yes
as
far
as
i
concerned
she
sews
the
crape
on
his
hat
allmers
sitting
and
looking
at
her
where
is
rita
asta
she
is
walking
about
the
garden
a
little
i
think
borgheim
is
with
her
allmers
slightly
surprised
indeed
is
borgheim
out
here
again
asta
yes
he
came
out
by
the
train
allmers
i
did
expect
that
asta
serving
he
was
so
fond
of
eyolf
allmers
borgheim
is
a
faithful
soul
asta
asta
with
quiet
warmth
yes
faithful
he
is
indeed
that
is
certain
allmers
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
you
are
really
fond
of
him
asta
yes
i
am
allmers
and
yet
you
can
not
make
up
your
mind
to
asta
interrupting
oh
my
dear
alfred
do
talk
of
that
allmers
yes
yes
tell
me
why
you
can
not
asta
oh
no
please
you
really
must
not
ask
me
you
see
it
so
painful
for
there
now
the
hat
is
done
allmers
thank
you
asta
and
now
for
the
left
arm
allmers
am
i
to
have
crape
on
it
too
asta
yes
that
is
the
custom
allmers
well
as
you
please
she
moves
close
up
to
him
and
begins
to
sew
asta
keep
your
arm
still
then
i
wo
prick
you
allmers
with
a
this
is
like
the
old
days
asta
yes
do
you
think
so
allmers
when
you
were
a
little
girl
you
used
to
sit
just
like
this
mending
my
clothes
the
first
thing
you
ever
sewed
for
me
that
was
black
crape
too
asta
was
it
allmers
round
my
student
cap
at
the
time
of
father
death
asta
could
i
sew
then
fancy
i
have
forgotten
it
allmers
oh
you
were
such
a
little
thing
then
asta
yes
i
was
little
then
allmers
and
then
two
years
afterwards
when
we
lost
your
mother
then
again
you
sewed
a
big
crape
band
on
my
sleeve
asta
i
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
allmers
patting
her
hand
yes
yes
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
asta
and
then
when
we
were
left
alone
in
the
world
we
two
are
you
done
already
asta
yes
putting
together
her
it
was
really
a
beautiful
time
for
us
alfred
we
two
alone
allmers
yes
it
was
though
we
had
to
toil
so
hard
asta
you
toiled
allmers
with
more
life
oh
you
toiled
too
in
your
way
i
can
assure
you
smiling
my
dear
faithful
eyolf
asta
oh
you
must
remind
me
of
that
stupid
nonsense
about
the
name
allmers
well
if
you
had
been
a
boy
you
would
have
been
called
eyolf
asta
yes
if
but
when
you
began
to
go
to
college
smiling
involuntarily
i
wonder
how
you
could
be
so
childish
allmers
was
it
i
that
was
childish
asta
yes
indeed
i
think
it
was
as
i
look
back
upon
it
all
you
were
ashamed
of
having
no
brother
only
a
sister
allmers
no
no
it
was
you
dear
you
were
ashamed
asta
oh
yes
i
too
perhaps
a
little
and
somehow
or
other
i
was
sorry
for
you
allmers
yes
i
believe
you
were
and
then
you
hunted
up
some
of
my
old
boy
clothes
asta
your
fine
sunday
clothes
yes
do
you
remember
the
blue
blouse
and
knickerbockers
allmers
his
eyes
dwelling
upon
her
i
remember
so
well
how
you
looked
when
you
used
to
wear
them
asta
only
when
we
were
at
home
alone
though
allmers
and
how
serious
we
were
dear
and
how
mightily
pleased
with
ourselves
i
always
called
you
eyolf
asta
oh
alfred
i
hope
you
have
never
told
rita
this
allmers
yes
i
believe
i
did
once
tell
her
asta
oh
alfred
how
could
you
do
that
allmers
well
you
see
one
tells
one
wife
everything
very
nearly
asta
yes
i
suppose
one
does
allmers
as
if
awakening
clutches
at
his
forehead
and
starts
up
oh
how
can
i
sit
here
and
asta
rising
looks
sorrowfully
at
him
what
is
the
matter
allmers
he
had
almost
passed
away
from
me
he
had
passed
quite
away
asta
eyolf
allmers
here
i
sat
living
in
these
recollections
and
he
had
no
part
in
them
asta
yes
alfred
little
eyolf
was
behind
it
all
allmers
no
he
was
not
he
slipped
out
of
my
memory
out
of
my
thoughts
i
did
not
see
him
for
a
moment
as
we
sat
here
talking
i
utterly
forgot
him
all
that
time
asta
but
surely
you
must
take
some
rest
in
your
sorrow
allmers
no
no
no
that
is
just
what
i
will
not
do
i
must
not
i
have
no
right
and
no
heart
for
it
either
going
in
great
excitement
towards
the
right
all
my
thoughts
must
be
out
there
where
he
lies
drifting
in
the
depths
asta
following
him
and
holding
him
back
alfred
alfred
do
go
to
the
fiord
allmers
i
must
go
out
to
him
let
me
go
asta
i
will
take
the
boat
asta
in
terror
do
go
to
the
fiord
i
say
allmers
yielding
no
no
i
will
not
only
let
me
alone
asta
leading
him
back
to
the
table
you
must
rest
from
your
thoughts
alfred
come
here
and
sit
down
allmers
making
as
if
to
seat
himself
on
the
bench
well
well
as
you
please
asta
no
i
wo
let
you
sit
there
allmers
yes
let
me
asta
no
do
for
then
you
will
only
sit
looking
out
forces
him
down
upon
a
chair
with
his
back
to
the
right
there
now
now
right
seats
herself
upon
the
bench
and
now
we
can
talk
a
little
again
allmers
drawing
a
deep
breath
audibly
it
was
good
to
deaden
the
sorrow
and
heartache
for
a
moment
asta
you
insist
do
so
alfred
allmers
but
do
you
think
it
is
terribly
weak
and
unfeeling
of
me
to
be
able
to
do
so
asta
oh
no
i
am
sure
it
is
impossible
to
keep
circling
for
ever
round
one
fixed
thought
allmers
yes
for
me
it
is
impossible
before
you
came
to
me
here
i
sat
torturing
myself
unspeakably
with
this
crushing
gnawing
sorrow
asta
yes
allmers
and
would
you
believe
it
asta
h
asta
well
allmers
in
the
midst
of
all
the
agony
i
found
myself
speculating
what
we
should
have
for
dinner
asta
soothingly
well
well
if
only
it
rests
you
to
allmers
yes
just
fancy
dear
it
seemed
as
if
it
did
give
me
rest
holds
out
his
hand
to
her
across
the
table
how
good
it
is
asta
that
i
have
you
with
me
i
am
so
glad
of
that
glad
glad
even
in
my
sorrow
asta
looking
earnestly
at
him
you
ought
most
of
all
to
be
glad
that
you
have
rita
allmers
yes
of
course
i
should
but
rita
is
no
kin
to
me
it
like
having
a
sister
asta
eagerly
do
you
say
that
alfred
allmers
yes
our
family
is
a
thing
apart
half
jestingly
we
have
always
had
vowels
for
our
initials
do
you
remember
how
often
we
used
to
speak
of
that
and
all
our
relations
all
equally
poor
and
we
have
all
the
same
colour
of
eyes
asta
do
you
think
i
have
allmers
no
you
take
entirely
after
your
mother
you
are
not
in
the
least
like
the
rest
of
us
not
even
like
father
but
all
the
same
asta
all
the
same
allmers
well
i
believe
that
living
together
has
as
it
were
stamped
us
in
each
other
image
mentally
i
mean
asta
with
warm
emotion
oh
you
must
never
say
that
alfred
it
is
only
i
that
have
taken
my
stamp
from
you
and
it
is
to
you
that
i
owe
everything
every
good
thing
in
the
world
allmers
shaking
his
head
you
owe
me
nothing
asta
on
the
contrary
asta
i
owe
you
everything
you
must
never
doubt
that
no
sacrifice
has
been
too
great
for
you
allmers
interrupting
oh
nonsense
sacrifice
do
talk
of
such
a
i
have
only
loved
you
asta
ever
since
you
were
a
little
child
after
a
short
pause
and
then
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
so
much
injustice
to
make
up
to
you
for
asta
astonished
injustice
you
allmers
not
precisely
on
my
own
account
but
asta
eagerly
but
allmers
on
father
asta
half
rising
from
the
bench
on
father
sitting
down
again
what
do
you
mean
by
that
alfred
allmers
father
was
never
really
kind
to
you
asta
vehemently
oh
do
say
that
allmers
yes
it
is
true
he
did
not
love
you
not
as
he
ought
to
have
asta
evasively
no
perhaps
not
as
he
loved
you
that
was
only
natural
allmers
continuing
and
he
was
often
hard
to
your
mother
too
at
least
in
the
last
years
asta
softly
mother
was
so
much
much
younger
than
he
remember
that
allmers
do
you
think
they
were
not
quite
suited
to
each
other
asta
perhaps
not
allmers
yes
but
still
father
who
in
other
ways
was
so
gentle
and
so
kindly
towards
every
one
asta
quietly
mother
too
was
not
always
as
she
ought
to
have
been
allmers
your
mother
was
not
asta
perhaps
not
always
allmers
towards
father
do
you
mean
asta
yes
allmers
i
never
noticed
that
asta
struggling
with
her
tears
rises
oh
my
dear
alfred
let
them
rest
those
who
are
gone
she
goes
towards
the
right
allmers
rising
yes
let
them
rest
wringing
his
hands
but
those
who
are
gone
it
is
they
that
wo
let
us
rest
asta
neither
day
nor
night
asta
looks
warmly
at
him
time
will
make
it
all
seem
easier
alfred
allmers
looking
helplessly
at
her
yes
do
you
think
it
will
but
how
i
am
to
get
over
these
terrible
first
days
hoarsely
that
is
what
i
can
not
imagine
asta
imploringly
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
go
up
to
rita
oh
please
do
allmers
vehemently
withdrawing
from
her
no
no
no
do
talk
to
me
of
that
i
can
not
i
tell
you
more
calmly
let
me
remain
here
with
you
asta
well
i
will
not
leave
you
allmers
seizing
her
hand
and
holding
it
fast
thank
you
for
that
looks
out
for
a
time
over
the
fiord
where
is
my
little
eyolf
now
smiling
sadly
to
her
can
you
tell
me
that
my
big
wise
eyolf
shaking
his
head
no
one
in
all
the
world
can
tell
me
that
i
know
only
this
one
terrible
thing
that
he
is
gone
from
me
asta
looking
up
to
the
left
and
withdrawing
her
hand

in
one
place
allmers
i
have
nothing

not
bear

be
anywhere
long
least
of
all
here
with
the
fiord
at
my
very
feet
allmers
it
is
just
the
nearness
of
the
fiord

borgheim
do
you
think
he
should
come
back
with
the
rest
of

glance
of
comprehension

little
further
along

shore
for
the
very
last
time
asta
taking
her
umbrella
yes

let
us
go
a
little
further
asta
and
borgheim
go
out
together
behind
the
allmers
wanders
about
for
a
little
then
he
seats
himself
on
a
stone
under
the
trees
on
the
left
rita
comes
up
and
stands
before
him
her
hands
folded
and
hanging
down
can
you
think
the
thought
alfred
that
we
have
lost
eyolf
allmers
looking
sadly
at
the
ground
we
must
accustom
ourselves
to
think
it
rita
i
can
not
i
can
not
and
then
that
horrible
sight
that
will
haunt
me
all
my
life
long
allmers
looking
up
what
sight
what
have
you
seen
rita
i
have
seen
nothing
myself
i
have
only
heard
it
told
oh
allmers
you
may
as
well
tell
me
at
once
rita
i
got
borgheim
to
go
down
with
me
to
the
pier
allmers
what
did
you
want
there
rita
to
question
the
boys
as
to
how
it
happened
allmers
but
we
know
that
rita
we
got
to
know
more
allmers
well
rita
it
is
not
true
that
he
disappeared
all
at
once
allmers
do
they
say
that
now
rita
yes
they
say
they
saw
him
lying
down
on
the
bottom
deep
down
in
the
clear
water
allmers
grinding
his
teeth
and
they
did
save
him
rita
i
suppose
they
could
not
allmers
they
could
swim
every
one
of
them
did
they
tell
you
how
he
was
lying
whilst
they
could
see
him
rita
yes
they
said
he
was
lying
on
his
back
and
with
great
open
eyes
allmers
open
eyes
but
quite
still
rita
yes
quite
still
and
then
something
came
and
swept
him
away
they
called
it
the
undertow
allmers
nodding
slowly
so
that
was
the
last
they
saw
of
him
rita
suffocated
with
tears
yes
allmers
in
a
dull
voice
and
never
never
will
any
one
see
him
again
rita
wailing
i
shall
see
him
day
and
night
as
he
lay
down
there
allmers
with
great
open
eyes
rita
shuddering
yes
with
great
open
eyes
i
see
them
i
see
them
now
allmers
rises
slowly
and
looks
with
quiet
menace
at
her
were
they
evil
those
eyes
rita
rita
turning
pale
evil
allmers
going
close
up
to
her
were
they
evil
eyes
that
stared
up
up
from
the
depths
rita
shrinking
from
him
alfred
allmers
following
her
answer
me
were
they
a
child
evil
eyes
rita
shrieks
alfred
alfred
allmers
now
things
have
come
about
just
as
you
wished
rita
rita
i
what
did
i
wish
allmers
that
eyolf
were
not
here
rita
never
for
a
moment
have
i
wished
that
that
eyolf
should
not
stand
between
us
that
was
what
i
wished
allmers
well
well
he
does
not
stand
between
us
any
more
rita
softly
gazing
straight
before
her
perhaps
now
more
than
ever
with
a
sudden
shudder
oh
that
horrible
sight
allmers
nods
the
child
evil
eyes
rita
in
dread
recoiling
from
him
let
me
be
alfred
i
am
afraid
of
you
i
have
never
seen
you
like
this
before
allmers
looks
harshly
and
coldly
at
her
sorrow
makes
us
wicked
and
hateful
rita
terrified
and
yet
defiant
that
is
what
i
feel
too
allmers
goes
towards
the
right
and
looks
out
over
the
fiord
rita
seats
herself
at
the
table
a
short
pause
allmers
turning
his
head
towards
her
you
never
really
and
truly
loved
him
never
rita
with
cold
eyolf
would
never
let
me
take
him
really
and
truly
to
my
heart
allmers
because
you
did
not
want
to
rita
oh
yes
i
did
i
did
want
to
but
some
one
stood
in
the
way
even
from
the
first
allmers
turning
right
round
do
you
mean
that
stood
in
the
way
rita
oh
no
not
at
first
allmers
coming
nearer
her
who
then
rita
his
aunt
allmers
asta
rita
yes
asta
stood
and
barred
the
way
for
me
allmers
can
you
say
that
rita
rita
yes
asta
she
took
him
to
her
heart
from
the
moment
that
happened
that
miserable
fall
allmers
if
she
did
so
she
did
it
in
love
rita
vehemently
that
is
just
it
i
can
not
endure
to
share
anything
with
any
one
not
in
love
allmers
we
two
should
have
shared
him
between
us
in
love
rita
looking
scornfully
at
him
we
oh
the
truth
is
you
have
never
had
any
real
love
for
him
either
allmers
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
have
not
rita
no
you
have
not
at
first
you
were
so
utterly
taken
up
by
that
book
of
yours
about
responsibility
allmers
forcibly
yes
i
was
but
my
very
book
i
sacrificed
for
eyolf
sake
rita
not
out
of
love
for
him
allmers
why
then
do
you
suppose
rita
because
you
were
consumed
with
mistrust
of
yourself
because
you
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
you
had
any
great
vocation
to
live
for
in
the
world
allmers
observing
her
closely
could
you
see
that
in
me
rita
oh
yes
little
by
little
and
then
you
needed
something
new
to
fill
up
your
it
seems
was
not
enough
for
you
any
longer
allmers
that
is
the
law
of
change
rita
rita
and
that
was
why
you
wanted
to
make
a
prodigy
of
poor
little
eyolf
allmers
that
was
not
what
i
wanted
i
wanted
to
make
a
happy
human
being
of
that
and
nothing
more
rita
but
not
out
of
love
for
him
look
into
yourself
with
a
certain
shyness
of
expression
search
out
all
that
lies
under
and
behind
your
action
allmers
avoiding
her
eyes
there
is
something
you
shrink
from
saying
rita
and
you
too
allmers
looks
thoughtfully
at
her
if
it
is
as
you
say
then
we
two
have
never
really
possessed
our
own
child
rita
no
not
in
perfect
love
allmers
and
yet
we
are
sorrowing
so
bitterly
for
him
rita
with
sarcasm
yes
is
it
curious
that
we
should
grieve
like
this
over
a
little
stranger
boy
allmers
with
an
outburst
oh
do
call
him
a
stranger
rita
sadly
shaking
her
head
we
never
won
the
boy
alfred
not
i
nor
you
either
allmers
wringing
his
hands
and
now
it
is
too
late
too
late
rita
and
no
consolation
anywhere
in
anything
allmers
with
sudden
passion
you
are
the
guilty
one
in
this
rita
rising
i
allmers
yes
you
it
was
your
fault
that
he
became
what
he
was
it
was
your
fault
that
he
could
not
save
himself
when
he
fell
into
the
water
rita
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
alfred
you
shall
not
throw
the
blame
upon
me
allmers
more
and
more
beside
himself
yes
yes
i
do
it
was
you
that
left
the
helpless
child
unwatched
upon
the
table
rita
he
was
lying
so
comfortably
among
the
cushions
and
sleeping
so
soundly
and
you
had
promised
to
look
after
him
allmers
yes
i
had
lowering
his
voice
but
then
you
came
you
you
you
and
lured
me
to
you
rita
looking
defiantly
at
him
oh
better
own
at
once
that
you
forgot
the
child
and
everything
else
allmers
in
suppressed
desperation
yes
that
is
true
lower
i
forgot
the
child
in
your
arms
rita
exasperated
alfred
alfred
this
is
intolerable
of
you
allmers
in
a
low
voice
clenching
his
fists
before
her
face
in
that
hour
you
condemned
little
eyolf
to
death
rita
wildly
you
too
you
too
if
it
is
as
you
say
allmers
oh
yes
call
me
to
account
too
if
you
will
we
have
sinned
both
of
us
and
so
after
all
there
was
retribution
in
eyolf
death
rita
retribution
allmers
with
more
yes
judgment
upon
you
and
me
now
as
we
stand
here
we
have
our
deserts
while
he
lived
we
let
ourselves
shrink
away
from
him
in
secret
abject
remorse
we
could
not
bear
to
see
it
the
thing
he
had
to
drag
with
him
rita
whispers
the
crutch
allmers
yes
that
and
now
what
we
now
call
sorrow
and
heartache
is
really
the
gnawing
of
conscience
rita
nothing
else
rita
gazing
helplessly
at
him
i
feel
as
if
all
this
must
end
in
despair
in
madness
for
both
of
us
for
we
can
never
never
make
it
good
again
allmers
passing
into
a
calmer
mood
i
dreamed
about
eyolf
last
night
i
thought
i
saw
him
coming
up
from
the
pier
he
could
run
like
other
boys
so
nothing
had
happened
to
him
neither
the
one
thing
nor
the
other
and
the
torturing
reality
was
nothing
but
a
dream
i
thought
oh
how
i
thanked
and
blessed
checking
himself
h
rita
looking
at
him
whom
allmers
evasively
whom
rita
yes
whom
did
you
thank
and
bless
allmers
putting
aside
the
question
i
was
only
dreaming
you
know
rita
one
whom
you
yourself
do
not
believe
in
allmers
that
was
how
i
felt
all
the
same
of
course
i
was
sleeping
rita
reproachfully
you
should
not
have
taught
me
to
doubt
alfred
allmers
would
it
leave
been
right
of
me
to
let
you
go
through
life
with
your
mind
full
of
empty
fictions
rita
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
for
then
i
should
have
had
something
to
take
refuge
in
now
i
am
utterly
at
sea
allmers
observing
her
closely
if
you
had
the
choice
now
if
you
could
follow
eyolf
to
where
he
is
rita
yes
what
then
allmers
if
you
were
fully
assured
that
you
would
find
him
again
know
him
understand
him
rita
yes
yes
what
then
allmers
would
you
of
your
own
free
will
take
the
leap
over
to
him
of
your
own
free
will
leave
everything
behind
you
renounce
your
whole
earthly
life
would
you
rita
rita
softly
now
at
once
allmers
yes
this
very
hour
answer
me
would
you
rita
hesitating
oh
i
do
know
alfred
no
i
think
i
should
have
to
stay
here
with
you
a
little
while
allmers
for
my
sake
rita
yes
only
for
your
sake
allmers
and
afterwards
would
you
then
answer
rita
oh
what
can
i
answer
i
could
not
go
away
from
you
never
never
allmers
but
suppose
now
went
to
eyolf
and
you
had
the
fullest
assurance
that
you
would
meet
both
him
and
me
there
then
would
you
come
over
to
us
rita
i
should
want
to
so
much
so
much
but
allmers
well
i
i
rita
moaning
softly
i
could
not
i
feel
it
no
no
i
never
could
not
for
all
the
glory
of
heaven
allmers
nor
rita
no
you
feel
it
so
too
do
you
alfred
you
could
not
either
could
you
allmers
no
for
it
is
here
in
the
life
of
earth
that
we
living
beings
are
at
home
rita
yes
here
lies
the
kind
of
happiness
that
we
can
understand
allmers
darkly
oh
happiness
happiness
rita
you
mean
that
happiness
that
we
can
never
find
it
again
looks
inquiringly
at
him
but
if
vehemently
no
no
i
dare
not
say
it
nor
even
think
it
allmers
yes
say
it
say
it
rita
rita
hesitatingly
could
we
not
try
to
would
it
not
be
possible
to
forget
him
allmers
forget
eyolf
rita
forget
the
anguish
and
remorse
i
mean
allmers
can
you
wish
it
rita
yes
if
it
were
possible
with
an
outburst
for
this
i
can
not
bear
this
for
ever
oh
can
we
not
think
of
something
that
will
bring
its
forgetfulness
allmers
shakes
his
head
what
could
that
be
rita
could
we
not
see
what
travelling
would
do
far
away
from
here
allmers
from
home
when
you
know
you
are
never
really
well
anywhere
but
here
rita
well
then
let
us
have
crowds
of
people
about
us
keep
open
house
plunge
into
something
that
can
deaden
and
dull
our
thoughts
allmers
such
it
life
would
be
impossible
for
no
rather
than
that
i
would
try
to
take
up
my
work
again
rita
bitingly
your
work
the
work
that
has
always
stood
like
a
dead
wall
between
us
allmers
slowly
looking
fixedly
at
her
there
must
always
be
a
dead
wall
between
us
two
from
this
time
forth
rita
why
must
there
allmers
who
knows
but
that
a
child
great
open
eyes
are
watching
us
day
and
night
rita
softly
shuddering
alfred
how
terrible
to
think
of
allmers
our
love
has
been
like
a
consuming
fire
now
it
must
be
quenched
rita
with
a
movement
towards
him
quenched
allmers
hardly
it
is
quenched
in
one
of
us
rita
as
if
petrified
and
you
dare
say
that
to
me
allmers
more
gently
it
is
dead
rita
but
in
what
i
now
feel
for
you
in
our
common
guilt
and
need
of
atonement
i
seem
to
foresee
a
sort
of
resurrection
rita
vehemently
i
do
care
a
bit
about
any
resurrection
allmers
rita
rita
i
am
a
being
i
do
go
drowsing
about
with
blood
in
my
veins
wringing
her
hands
and
now
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
in
anguish
and
remorse
imprisoned
with
one
who
is
no
longer
mine
mine
mine
allmers
it
must
have
ended
so
sometime
rita
rita
must
have
ended
so
the
love
that
in
the
beginning
rushed
forth
so
eagerly
to
meet
with
love
allmers
my
love
did
not
rush
forth
to
you
in
the
beginning
rita
what
did
you
feel
for
me
first
of
all
allmers
dread
rita
that
i
can
understand
how
was
it
then
that
i
won
you
after
all
allmers
in
a
low
voice
you
were
so
entrancingly
beautiful
rita
rita
looks
searchingly
at
him
then
that
was
the
only
reason
say
it
alfred
the
only
reason
allmers
conquering
himself
no
there
was
another
as
well
rita
with
an
outburst
i
can
guess
what
that
was
it
was
my
gold
and
my
green
forests
as
you
call
it
was
it
not
so
alfred
allmers
yes
rita
looks
at
him
with
deep
reproach
how
could
you
how
could
you
allmers
i
had
asta
to
think
of
rita
angrily
yes
asta
bitterly
then
it
was
really
asta
that
brought
us
two
together
allmers
she
knew
nothing
about
it
she
has
no
suspicion
of
it
even
to
this
day
rita
rejecting
the
plea
it
was
asta
nevertheless
smiling
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
scorn
or
no
it
was
little
eyolf
little
eyolf
my
dear
allmers
eyolf
rita
yes
you
used
to
call
her
eyolf
did
you
not
i
seem
to
remember
your
telling
me
so
once
in
a
moment
of
confidence
coming
up
to
him
do
you
remember
it
that
entrancingly
beautiful
hour
alfred
allmers
recoiling
as
if
in
horror
i
remember
nothing
i
will
not
remember
rita
following
him
it
was
in
that
hour
when
your
other

a
hollow
voice
supporting
himself
against
the
table

upon
a
chair
borgheim

very
silent
during
our
walk
rita

has
she
well
alfred
and
i
have
talked
things
out
thoroughly
enough
asta
looking
eagerly
at
both
of
them

is
this
rita
enough
to
last
all
our
lifetime
i
say
breaking
off
come
now
let

is
the
matter

that

not
endure
to
be
here

more
asta
here
with
rita
do
you
mean
allmers
yes
rita
and
i
can
not
go
on
living

his
arm
and
shakes
it
oh

say
anything
so
terrible
allmers
it
is
the
truth
i
am
telling
you
we
are
making
each
other
wicked
and
hateful
asta
with
painful
emotion
i
had
never
never
dreamt
of
anything
like
this
allmers
i
did
not
realise
it
either
till
asta
and
now
you
want
to
what
is
it
you
really
want
alfred
allmers
i
want
to
get
away
from
everything
here
far
far
away
from
it
all
asta
and
to
stand
quite
alone
in
the
world
allmers
nods
as
i
used
to
before
yes
asta
but
you
are
not
fitted
for
living
alone
allmers
oh
yes
i
was
so
in
the
old
days
at
any
rate
asta
in
the
old
days
yes
for
then
you
had
me
with
you
allmers
trying
to
take
her
hand
yes
and
it
is
to
you
asta
that
i
now
want
to
come
home
again
asta
eluding
him
to
me
no
no
alfred
that
is
quite
impossible
allmers
looks
sadly
at
her
then
borgheim
stands
in
the
way
after
all
asta
earnestly
no
no
he
does
not
that
is
quite
a
mistake
allmers
good
then
i
will
come
to
you
my
dear
dear
sister
i
must
come
to
you
again
home
to
you
to
be
purified
and
ennobled
after
my
life
with
asta
shocked
alfred
you
are
doing
rita
a
great
wrong
allmers
i
have
done
her
a
great
wrong
but
not
in
this
oh
think
of
it
asta
think
of
our
life
together
yours
and
mine
was
it
not
like
one
long
from
first
to
last
asta
yes
it
was
alfred
but
we
can
never
live
it
over
again
allmers
bitterly
do
you
mean
that
marriage
has
so
irreparably
ruined
me
asta
quietly
no
that
is
not
what
i
mean
allmers
well
then
we
two
will
live
our
old
life
over
again
asta
with
decision
we
can
not
alfred
allmers
yes
we
can
for
the
love
of
a
brother
and
sister
asta
eagerly
what
of
it
allmers
that
is
the
only
relation
in
life
that
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
change
asta
softly
and
tremblingly
but
if
that
relation
were
not
allmers
not
not
our
relation
allmers
stares
at
her
in
astonishment
not
ours
why
what
can
you
mean
by
that
asta
it
is
best
i
should
tell
you
at
once
alfred
allmers
yes
yes
tell
me
asta
the
letters
to
mother
those
in
my
portfolio
allmers
well
asta
you
must
read
them
when
i
am
gone
allmers
why
must
i
asta
struggling
with
herself
for
then
you
will
see
that
allmers
well
that
i
have
no
right
to
bear
your
father
name
allmers
staggering
backwards
asta
what
is
this
you
say
asta
read
the
letters
then
you
will
see
and
understand
and
perhaps
have
some
forgiveness
for
mother
too
allmers
clutching
at
his
forehead
i
can
not
grasp
this
i
can
not
realise
the
thought
you
asta
you
are
not
asta
you
are
not
my
brother
alfred
allmers
quickly
half
defiantly
looking
at
her
well
but
what
difference
does
that
really
make
in
our
relation
practically
none
at
all
asta
shaking
her
head
it
makes
all
the
difference
alfred
our
relation
is
not
that
of
brother
and
sister
allmers
no
no
but
it
is
none
the
less
sacred
for
that
it
will
always
be
equally
sacred
asta
do
not
forget
that
it
is
subject
to
the
law
of
change
as
you
said
just
now
allmers
looks
inquiringly
at
her
do
you
mean
that
asta
quietly
but
with
rearm
emotion
not
a
word
more
my
dear
dear
alfred
takes
up
the
flowers
from
the
chair
do
you
see
these
allmers
nodding
slowly
they
are
the
sort
that
shoot
up
from
the
very
depth
asta
i
pulled
them
in
the
tarn
where
it
flows
out
into
the
fiord
holds
them
out
to
him
will
you
take
them
alfred
allmers
taking
them
thanks
asta
with
tears
in
her
eyes
they
are
a
last
greeting
to
you
from
from
little
eyolf
allmers
looking
at
her
from
eyolf
out
yonder
or
from
you
asta
softly
from
both
of
us
taking
up
her
umbrella
now
come
with
me
to
rita
she
goes
up
the
allmers
takes
up
his
hat
from
the
table
and
whispers
sadly
asta
eyolf
little
eyolf
he
follows
her
up
the
path
act
third
an
elevation
overgrown
with
shrubs
in
allmers
garden
at
the
back
a
sheer
cliff
with
a
railing
along
its
edge
and
with
steps
on
the
left
leading
downwards
an
extensive
view
over
the
fiord
which
lies
deep
below
a
flagstaff
with
lines
but
no
flag
stands
by
the
railing
in
front
on
the
right
a
covered
with
creepers
and
wild
vines
outside
it
a
bench
it
is
a
late
summer
evening
with
clear
sky
deepening
twilight
asta
is
sitting
on
the
bench
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
she
is
wearing
her
outdoor
dress
and
a
hat
has
her
parasol
at
her
side
and
a
little
on
a
strap
over
her
shoulder
borgheim
comes
up
from
the
back
on
the
left
he
too
has
a
over
his
shoulder
he
is
carrying
a
flag
borgheim
catching
sight
of
asta
oh
so
you
are
up
here
asta
yes
i
am
taking
my
last
look
out
over
the
fiord
borgheim
then
i
am
glad
i
happened
to
come
up
asta
have
you
been
searching
for
me
borgheim
yes
i
have
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
for
the
present
not
for
good
and
all
i
hope
asta
with
a
faint
smile
you
are
persevering
borgheim
a
has
got
to
be
asta
have
you
seen
anything
of
alfred
or
of
rita
borgheim
yes
i
saw
them
both
asta
together
borgheim
no
apart
asta
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
flag
borgheim
allmers
asked
me
to
come
up
and
hoist
it
asta
hoist
a
flag
just
now
borgheim
high
she
wants
it
to
fly
both
night
and
day
she
says
asta
sighing
poor
rita
and
poor
alfred
borgheim
busied
with
the
flag
have
you
the
heart
to
leave
them
i
ask
because
i
see
you
are
in
asta
in
a
low
voice
i
must
go
borgheim
well
if
you
must
then
asta
and
you
are
going
too
borgheim
i
must
too
i
am
going
by
the
train
are
you
going
that
way
asta
no
i
shall
take
the
steamer
borgheim
glancing
at
her
we
each
take
our
own
way
then
asta
yes
she
sits
and
looks
on
while
he
hoists
the
flag
high
when
he
has
done
he
goes
up
to
her
borgheim
miss
asta
you
ca
think
how
grieved
i
am
about
little
eyolf
asta
looks
up
at
him
yes
i
am
sure
you
feel
it
deeply
borgheim
and
the
feeling
tortures
me
for
the
fact
is
grief
is
not
much
in
my
way
asta
raising
her
eyes
to
the
flag
it
will
pass
over
in
time
all
of
it
all
our
sorrow
borgheim
all
do
you
believe
that
asta
like
a
squall
at
sea
when
once
you
have
got
far
away
from
here
then
borgheim
it
will
have
to
be
very
far
away
indeed
asta
and
then
you
have
this
great
new
too
borgheim
but
no
one
to
help
me
in
it
asta
oh
yes
surely
you
have
borgheim
shaking
his
head
no
one
no
one
to
share
the
gladness
with
for
it
is
gladness
that
most
needs
sharing
asta
not
the
labour
and
trouble
borgheim
pooh
that
sort
of
thing
one
can
always
get
through
alone
asta
but
the
gladness
that
must
be
shared
with
some
one
you
think
borgheim
yes
for
if
not
where
would
be
the
pleasure
in
being
glad
asta
ah
yes
perhaps
there
is
something
in
that
borgheim
oh
of
course
for
a
certain
time
you
can
go
on
feeling
glad
in
your
own
heart
but
it
wo
do
in
the
long
run
no
it
takes
two
to
be
glad
asta
always
two
never
more
never
many
borgheim
well
you
see
then
it
becomes
a
quite
different
matter
miss
asta
are
you
sure
you
can
never
make
up
your
mind
to
share
gladness
and
success
and
and
labour
and
trouble
with
one
with
one
alone
in
all
the
world
asta
i
have
tried
it
once
borgheim
have
you
asta
yes
all
the
time
that
my
brother
that
alfred
and
i
lived
together
borgheim
oh
with
your
brother
yes
but
that
is
altogether
different
that
ought
rather
to
be
called
peace
than
happiness
i
should
say
asta
it
was
delightful
all
the
same
borgheim
there
now
you
see
even
that
seemed
to
you
delightful
but
just
think
now
if
he
had
not
been
your
brother
asta
makes
a
movement
to
rise
but
remains
sitting
then
we
should
never
have
been
together
for
i
was
a
child
then
and
he
was
much
more
borgheim
after
a
pause
was
it
so
delightful
that
time
asta
oh
yes
indeed
it
was
borgheim
was
there
much
that
was
really
bright
and
happy
in
your
life
then
asta
oh
yes
so
much
you
can
not
think
how
much
borgheim
tell
me
a
little
about
it
miss
asta
asta
oh
there
are
only
trifles
to
tell
borgheim
such
as
well
asta
such
as
the
time
when
alfred
had
passed
his
examination
and
had
distinguished
himself
and
then
from
time
to
time
when
he
got
a
post
in
some
school
or
other
or
when
he
would
sit
at
home
working
at
an
article
and
would
read
it
aloud
to
me
and
then
when
it
would
appear
in
some
magazine
borgheim
yes
i
can
quite
see
that
it
must
have
been
a
peaceful
delightful
life
a
brother
and
sister
sharing
all
their
joys
shaking
his
head
what
i
can
not
understand
is
that
your
brother
could
ever
give
you
up
asta
asta
with
suppressed
emotion
alfred
married
you
know
borgheim
was
not
that
very
hard
for
you
asta
yes
at
first
it
seemed
as
though
i
had
utterly
lost
him
all
at
once
borgheim
well
luckily
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
asta
no
borgheim
but
all
the
same
how
could
he
go
and
marry
i
mean
when
he
could
have
kept
you
with
him
alone
asta
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
he
was
subject
to
the
law
of
change
i
suppose
borgheim
the
law
of
change
asta
so
alfred
calls
it
borgheim
pooh
what
a
stupid
law
that
must
be
i
do
believe
a
bit
in
that
law
asta
rising
you
may
come
to
believe
in
it
in
time
borgheim
never
in
all
my
life
insistently
but
listen
now
miss
asta
do
be
reasonable
for
once
in
a
way
in
this
matter
i
mean
asta
interrupting
him
oh
no
no
do
let
us
begin
upon
that
again
borgheim
continuing
as
before
yes
asta
i
ca
possibly
give
you
up
so
easily
now
your
brother
has
everything
as
he
wishes
it
he
can
live
his
life
quite
contentedly
without
you
he
does
require
you
at
all
then
this
this
that
at
one
blow
has
changed
your
whole
position
here
asta
with
a
start
what
do
you
mean
by
that
borgheim
the
loss
of
the
child
what
else
should
i
mean
asta
recovering
her
little
eyolf
is
gone
yes
borgheim
and
what
more
does
that
leave
you
to
do
here
you
have
not
the
poor
little
boy
to
take
care
of
now
you
have
no
duties
no
claims
upon
you
of
any
sort
asta
oh
please
borgheim
do
make
it
so
hard
for
me
borgheim
i
must
i
should
be
mad
if
i
did
not
try
my
uttermost
i
shall
be
leaving
town
before
very
long
rind
perhaps
i
shall
have
no
opportunity
of
meeting
you
there
perhaps
i
shall
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
long
time
and
who
knows
what
may
happen
in
the
meanwhile
asta
with
a
grave
smile
so
you
are
afraid
of
the
law
of
change
after
all
borgheim
no
not
in
the
least
laughing
bitterly
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
changed
either
not
in
you
i
mean
for
i
can
see
you
do
care
much
about
me
asta
you
know
very
well
that
i
do
borgheim
perhaps
but
not
nearly
enough
not
as
i
want
you
to
more
forcibly
by
heaven
asta
miss
asta
i
can
not
tell
you
how
strongly
i
feel
that
you
are
wrong
in
this
a
little
onward
perhaps
from
and
all
life
happiness
may
be
awaiting
us
and
we
must
needs
pass
it
by
do
you
think
we
will
not
come
to
repent
of
it
asta
asta
quietly
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
they
are
not
for
us
all
these
bright
possibilities
borgheim
looks
at
her
with
then
i
must
make
my
roads
alone
asta
warmly
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
stand
by
you
in
it
all
help
you
in
the
labour
share
the
gladness
with
you
borgheim
would
you
if
you
could
asta
yes
that
i
would
borgheim
but
you
can
not
asta
looking
down
would
you
be
content
to
have
only
half
of
me
borgheim
no
you
must
be
utterly
and
entirely
mine
asta
looks
at
him
and
says
quietly
then
i
can
not
borgheim
then
miss
asta
he
is
on
the
point
of
going
allmers
comes
up
from
the
left
at
the
back
borgheim
stops
allmers
the
moment
he
has
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
points
and
says
in
a
low
voice
is
rita
in
there
in
the
borgheim
no
there
is
no
one
here
but
miss
asta
allmers
comes
forward
asta
going
towards
him
shall
i
go
down
and
look
for
her
shall
i
get
her
to
come
up
here
allmers
with
a
negative
gesture
no
no
no
let
it
alone
to
borgheim
is
it
you
that
have
hoisted
the
flag
borgheim
yes
allmers
asked
me
to
that
was
what
brought
me
up
here
allmers
and
you
are
going
to
start
borgheim
yes
i
go
away
in
good
earnest
allmers
with
a
glance
at
asta
and
you
have
made
sure
of
pleasant
company
i
daresay
borgheim
shaking
his
head
i
am
going
alone
allmers
with
surprise
alone
borgheim
utterly
alone
allmers
absently
indeed
borgheim
and
i
shall
have
to
remain
alone
too
allmers
there
is
something
horrible
in
being
alone
the
thought
of
it
runs
like
ice
through
my
blood
asta
oh
but
alfred
you
are
not
alone
allmers
there
may
be
something
horrible
in
that
too
asta
asta
oppressed
oh
do
talk
like
that
do
think
like
that
allmers
not
listening
to
her
but
since
you
are
not
going
with
him
since
there
is
nothing
to
bind
you
why
will
you
not
remain
out
here
with
me
and
with
rita
asta
uneasily
no
no
i
can
not
i
must
go
back

open
eyes
fixed
upon
me
asta
tenderly
and
sympathetically
what
if

were
so
rita
you
ought
not
to
be

eyes

alfred
and
i
can
not
go
alone
through
the
sorrow
and
heartache

through
the
ranklings
of
remorse

not
bear
it

suppressed
outburst
of
joy

how
it
is
well
then
you
can
not

with
us
asta
throwing
her
arms
round
her
neck
thanks
for
everything

goes
up
to
allmers
and
grasps
his
hand
a
thousand
times
allmers
softly
and
eagerly
what
is
this
asta
it
seems
as
though
you
were
taking
flight
asta
in
subdued
anguish
yes
alfred
i
am
taking
flight
allmers
flight
from
me
asta
whispering
from
you
and
from
myself
allmers
shrinking
back
ah
asta
rushes
down
the
steps
at
the
back
borgheim
waves
his
hat
and
follows
her
rita
leans
against
the
entrance
to
the
allmers
goes
in
strong
inward
emotion
up
to
the
railing
and
stands
there
gazing
downwards
a
pause
allmers
turns
and
says
with
composure
there
comes
the
steamer
look
rita
rita
i
dare
not
look
at
it
allmers
you
dare
not
rita
no
for
it
has
a
red
eye
and
a
green
one
too
great
glowing
eyes
allmers
oh
those
are
only
the
lights
you
know
rita
henceforth
they
are
eyes
for
me
they
stare
and
stare
out
of
the
darkness
and
into
the
darkness
allmers
now
she
is
putting
in
to
shore
rita
where
are
they
mooring
her
this
evening
then
allmers
coming
forward
at
the
pier
as
usual
rita
drawing
herself
up
how
can
they
moor
her
there
allmers
they
must
rita
but
it
was
there
that
eyolf
how
can
they
moor
her
there
allmers
yes
life
is
pitiless
rita
rita
men
are
heartless
they
take
no
thought
whether
for
the
living
or
for
the
dead
allmers
there
you
are
right
life
goes
its
own
way
just
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
had
happened
rita
gazing
straight
before
her
and
nothing
has
happened
either
not
to
others
only
to
us
two
allmers
the
pain
yes
rita
so
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
you
bore
him
in
sorrow
and
anguish
for
now
he
is
gone
again
and
has
left
no
trace
behind
him
rita
only
the
crutch
was
saved
allmers
angrily
be
silent
do
not
let
me
hear
that
word
rita
plaintively
oh
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
that
he
is
gone
from
us
allmers
coldly
and
bitterly
you
could
very
well
do
without
him
while
he
was
with
us
half
the
day
would
often
pass
without
your
setting
eyes
on
him
rita
yes
for
i
knew
that
i
could
see
him
whenever
i
wanted
to
allmers
yes
that
is
how
we
have
gone
and
squandered
the
short
time
we
had
with
little
eyolf
rita
listening
in
dread
do
you
hear
alfred
now
it
is
ringing
again
allmers
looking
over
the
fiord
it
is
the
steamer
bell
that
is
ringing
she
is
just
starting
rita
oh
it
not
that
bell
i
mean
all
day
i
have
heard
it
ringing
in
my
now
it
is
ringing
again
allmers
going
up
to
her
you
are
mistaken
rita
rita
no
i
hear
it
so
plainly
it
sounds
like
a
knell
slow
slow
and
always
the
same
words
allmers
words
what
words
rita
nodding
her
head
in
the
rhythm
the
crútch
is
flóating
the
crútch
is
flóating
oh
surely
you
must
hear
it
too
allmers
shaking
his
head
i
hear
nothing
and
there
is
nothing
to
hear
rita
oh
you
may
say
what
you
will
i
hear
it
so
plainly
allmers
looking
out
over
the
railing
now
they
are
on
board
rita
now
the
steamer
is
on
her
way
to
the
town
rita
is
it
possible
you
do
not
hear
it
the
crútch
is
flóating
the
crútch
is
allmers
coming
forward
you
shall
not
stand
there
listening
to
a
sound
that
does
not
exist
i
tell
you
asta
and
borgheim
are
on
board
they
have
started
already
asta
is
gone
rita
looks
timidly
at
him
then
i
suppose
you
will
soon
be
gone
too
alfred
allmers
quickly
what
do
you
mean
by
that
rita
that
you
will
follow
your
sister
allmers
has
asta
told
you
anything
rita
no
but
you
said
yourself
it
was
for
asta
sake
that
that
we
came
together
allmers
yes
but
you
you
yourself
have
bound
me
to
you
by
our
life
together
rita
oh
in
your
eyes
i
am
not
i
am
not
entrancingly
beautiful
any
more
allmers
the
law
of
change
may
perhaps
keep
us
together
none
the
less
rita
nodding
slowly
there
is
a
change
in
me
now
i
feel
the
anguish
of
it
allmers
anguish
rita
yes
for
change
too
is
a
sort
of
birth
allmers
it
is
or
a
resurrection
transition
to
a
higher
life
rita
gazing
sadly
before
her
yes
with
the
loss
of
all
all
happiness
allmers
that
loss
is
just
the
gain
rita
vehemently
oh
phrases
good
god
we
are
creatures
of
earth
after
all
allmers
but
something
akin
to
the
sea
and
the
heavens
too
rita
rita
you
perhaps
not
allmers
oh
yes
you
too
more
than
you
yourself
suspect
rita
advancing
a
pace
towards
him
tell
me
alfred
could
you
think
of
taking
up
your
work
again
allmers
the
work
that
you
have
hated
so
rita
i
am
easier
to
please
now
i
am
willing
to
share
you
with
the
book
allmers
why
rita
only
to
keep
you
here
with
me
to
have
you
near
me
allmers
oh
it
is
so
little
i
can
do
to
help
you
rita
rita
but
perhaps
i
could
help
you
allmers
with
my
book
do
you
mean
rita
no
but
to
live
your
life
allmers
shaking
his
head
i
seem
to
have
no
life
to
live
rita
well
then
to
endure
your
life
allmers
darkly
looking
away
from
her
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
both
of
us
that
we
should
part
rita
looking
curiously
at
him
then
where
would
you
go
perhaps
to
asta
after
all
allmers
no
never
again
to
asta
rita
where
then
allmers
up
into
the
solitudes
rita
up
among
the
mountains
is
that
what
you
mean
allmers
yes
rita
but
all
that
is
mere
dreaming
alfred
you
could
not
live
up
there
allmers
and
yet
i
feel
myself
drawn
to
them
rita
why
tell
me
allmers
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
something
rita
something
that
happened
to
you
up
there
allmers
yes
rita
and
that
you
never
told
asta
and
me
allmers
yes
rita
oh
you
are
so
silent
about
everything
you
ought
not
to
be
allmers
sit
down
there
and
i
will
tell
you
about
it
rita
yes
yes
tell
me
she
sits
on
the
bench
beside
the
allmers
i
was
alone
up
there
in
the
heart
of
the
great
mountains
i
came
to
a
wide
dreary
mountain
lake
and
that
lake
i
had
to
cross
but
i
could
not
for
there
was
neither
a
boat
nor
any
one
there
rita
well
and
then
allmers
then
i
went
without
any
guidance
into
a
side
valley
i
thought
that
by
that
way
i
could
push
on
over
the
heights
and
between
the
peaks
and
then
down
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
rita
oh
and
you
lost
yourself
alfred
allmers
yes
i
mistook
the
direction
for
there
was
no
path
or
track
and
all
day
i
went
on
and
all
the
next
night
and
at
last
i
thought
i
should
never
see
the
face
of
man
again
rita
not
come
home
to
us
oh
then
i
am
sure
your
thoughts
were
with
us
here
allmers
no
they
were
not
rita
not
allmers
no
it
was
so
strange
both
you
and
eyolf
seemed
to
have
drifted
far
far
away
from
me
and
asta
too
rita
then
what
did
you
think
of
allmers
i
did
not
think
i
dragged
myself
along
among
the
precipices
and
revelled
in
the
peace
and
luxury
of
death
rita
springing
up
oh
do
speak
in
that
way
of
that
horror
allmers
i
did
not
feel
it
so
i
had
no
fear
here
went
death
and
i
it
seemed
to
me
like
two
good
it
all
seemed
so
natural
so
simple
i
thought
in
my
family
we
do
live
to
be
old
rita
oh
do
say
such
things
alfred
you
see
you
came
safely
out
of
it
after
all
allmers
yes
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
where
i
wanted
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
rita
it
must
have
been
a
night
of
terror
for
you
alfred
but
now
that
it
is
over
you
will
not
admit
it
to
yourself
allmers
that
night
sealed
my
resolution
and
it
was
then
that
i
turned
about
and
came
straight
homewards
to
eyolf
rita
softly
too
late
allmers
yes
and
then
when
my
came
and
took
him
then
i
felt
the
horror
of
it
of
it
all
of
all
that
in
spite
of
everything
we
dare
not
tear
ourselves
away
from
so
earthbound
are
we
both
of
us
rita
rita
with
a
gleam
of
joy
yes
you
are
too
are
you
not
coming
close
to
him
oh
let
us
live
our
life
together
as
long
as
we
can
allmers
shrugging
his
shoulders
live
our
life
yes
and
have
nothing
to
fill
life
with
an
empty
void
on
all
sides
wherever
i
look
rita
in
fear
oh
sooner
or
later
you
will
go
away
from
me
alfred
i
feel
it
i
can
see
it
in
your
face
you
will
go
away
from
me
allmers
with
my
do
you
mean
rita
no
i
mean
worse
than
that
of
your
own
free
will
you
will
leave
me
for
you
think
it
only
here
with
me
that
you
have
nothing
to
live
for
is
not
that
what
is
in
your
thoughts
allmers
looking
steadfastly
at
her
what
if
it
were
a
disturbance
and
the
noise
of
angry
quarrelling
voices
is
heard
from
down
below
in
the
distance
allmers
goes
to
the
railing
rita
what
is
that
with
an
outburst
oh
you
see
they
have
found
him
allmers
he
will
never
be
found
rita
but
what
is
it
then
allmers
coming
forward
only
fighting
as
usual
rita
down
on
the
beach
allmers
yes
the
whole
village
down
there
ought
to
be
swept
away
now
the
men
have
come
home
drunk
as
they
always
are
they
are
beating
the
children
do
you
hear
the
boys
crying
the
women
are
shrieking
for
help
for
them
rita
should
we
not
get
some
one
to
go
down
and
help
them
allmers
harshly
and
angrily
help
them
who
did
not
help
eyolf
let
them
go
as
they
let
eyolf
go
rita
oh
you
must
not
talk
like
that
alfred
nor
think
like
that
allmers
i
can
not
think
otherwise
all
the
old
hovels
ought
to
be
torn
down
rita
and
then
what
is
to
become
of
all
the
poor
people
allmers
they
must
go
somewhere
else
rita
and
the
children
too
allmers
does
it
make
much
difference
where
they
go
to
the
dogs
rita
quietly
and
reproachfully
you
are
forcing
yourself
into
this
harshness
alfred
allmers
vehemently
i
have
a
right
to
be
harsh
now
it
is
my
duty
rita
your
duty
allmers
my
duty
to
eyolf
he
must
not
lie
unavenged
once
for
all
rita
it
is
as
i
tell
you
think
it
over
have
the
whole
place
down
there
razed
to
the
ground
when
i
am
gone
rita
looks
intently
at
him
when
you
are
gone
allmers
yes
for
that
will
at
least
give
you
something
to
fill
your
life
with
and
something
you
must
have
rita
firmly
and
decidedly
there
you
are
right
must
but
can
you
guess
what
i
will
set
about
when
you
are
gone
allmers
well
what
rita
slowly
and
with
resolution
as
soon
as
you
are
gone
from
me
i
will
go
down
to
the
beach
and
bring
all
the
poor
neglected
children
home
with
me
all
the
mischievous
boys
allmers
what
will
you
do
with
them
here
rita
i
will
take
them
to
my
heart
allmers
you
rita
yes
i
will
from
the
day
you
leave
me
they
shall
all
be
here
all
of
them
as
if
they
were
mine
allmers
shocked
in
our
little
eyolf
place
rita
yes
in
our
little
eyolf
place
they
shall
live
in
rooms
they
shall
read
his
books
they
shall
play
with
his
toys
they
shall
take
it
in
turns
to
sit
in
his
chair
at
table
allmers
but
this
is
sheer
madness
in
you
i
do
not
know
a
creature
in
the
world
that
is
less
fitted
than
you
for
anything
of
that
sort
rita
then
i
shall
have
to
educate
myself
for
it
to
train
myself
to
discipline
myself
allmers
if
you
are
really
in
earnest
about
this
about
all
you
say
then
there
must
indeed
be
a
change
in
you
rita
yes
there
is
alfred
and
for
that
i
have
you
to
thank
you
have
made
an
empty
place
within
me
and
i
must
try
to
fill
it
up
with
something
with
something
that
is
a
little
like
love
allmers
stands
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
then
looks
at
her
the
truth
is
we
have
not
done
much
for
the
poor
people
down
there
rita
we
have
done
nothing
for
them
allmers
scarcely
even
thought
of
them
rita
never
thought
of
them
in
sympathy
allmers
we
who
had
the
gold
and
the
green
forests
rita
our
hands
were
closed
to
them
and
our
hearts
too
allmers
nods
then
it
was
perhaps
natural
enough
after
all
that
they
should
not
risk
their
lives
to
save
little
eyolf
rita
softly
think
alfred
are
you
so
certain
that
that
we
would
have
risked
ours
allmers
with
an
uneasy
gesture
of
repulsion
you
must
never
doubt
that
rita
oh
we
are
children
of
earth
allmers
what
do
you
really
think
you
can
do
with
all
these
neglected
children
rita
i
suppose
i
must
try
if
i
can
not
lighten
and
and
ennoble
their
lot
in
life
allmers
if
you
can
do
that
then
eyolf
was
not
born
in
vain
rita
nor
taken
from
us
in
vain
either
allmers
looking
steadfastly
at
her
be
quite
clear
about
one
thing
rita
it
is
not
love
that
is
driving
you
to
this
rita
no
it
is
not
at
any
rate
not
yet
allmers
well
then
what
is
it
rita
you
have
so
often
talked
to
asta
of
human
responsibility
allmers
of
the
book
that
you
hated
rita
i
hate
that
book
still
but
i
used
to
sit
and
listen
to
what
you
told
her
and
now
i
will
try
to
continue
it
in
my
own
way
allmers
shaking
his
head
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
that
unfinished
book
rita
no
i
have
another
reason
as
well
allmers
what
is
that
rita
softly
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
want
to
make
my
peace
with
the
great
open
eyes
you
see
allmers
struck
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
perhaps
i
could
join
you
in
that
and
help
you
rita
rita
would
you
allmers
yes
if
i
were
only
sure
i
could
rita
hesitatingly
but
then
you
would
have
to
remain
here
allmers
softly
let
us
try
if
it
could
not
be
so
rita
almost
inaudibly
yes
let
us
alfred
both
are
silent
then
allmers
goes
up
to
the
flagstaff
and
hoists
the
flag
to
the
top
rita
stands
beside
the
and
looks
at
him
in
silence
allmers
coming
forward
again
we
have
a
heavy
day
of
work
before
us
rita
rita
you
will
see
that
now
and
then
a
sabbath
peace
will
descend
on
us
allmers
quietly
with
emotion
then
perhaps
we
shall
know
that
the
spirits
are
with
us
rita
whispering
the
spirits
allmers
as
before
yes
they
will
perhaps
be
around
us
those
whom
we
have
lost
rita
nods
slowly
our
little
eyolf
and
your
big
eyolf
too
allmers
gazing
straight
before
him
now
and
then
perhaps
we
may
still
on
the
way
through
life
have
a
little
passing
glimpse
of
them
rita
when
shall
we
look
for
them
alfred
allmers
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
upwards
rita
nods
in
approval
yes
yes
upwards
allmers
upwards
towards
the
peaks
towards
the
stars
and
towards
the
great
silence
rita
giving
him
her
hand
thanks
