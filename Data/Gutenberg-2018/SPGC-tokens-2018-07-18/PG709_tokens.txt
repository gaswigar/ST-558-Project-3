the
mountain
curdie
was
the
son
of
peter
the
miner
he
lived
with
his
father
and
mother
in
a
cottage
built
on
a
mountain
and
he
worked
with
his
father
inside
the
mountain
a
mountain
is
a
strange
and
awful
thing
in
old
times
without
knowing
so
much
of
their
strangeness
and
awfulness
as
we
do
people
were
yet
more
afraid
of
mountains
but
then
somehow
they
had
not
come
to
see
how
beautiful
they
are
as
well
as
awful
and
they
hated
them
and
what
people
hate
they
must
fear
now
that
we
have
learned
to
look
at
them
with
admiration
perhaps
we
do
not
feel
quite
awe
enough
of
them
to
me
they
are
beautiful
terrors
i
will
try
to
tell
you
what
they
are
they
are
portions
of
the
heart
of
the
earth
that
have
escaped
from
the
dungeon
down
below
and
rushed
up
and
out
for
the
heart
of
the
earth
is
a
great
wallowing
mass
not
of
blood
as
in
the
hearts
of
men
and
animals
but
of
glowing
hot
melted
metals
and
stones
and
as
our
hearts
keep
us
alive
so
that
great
lump
of
heat
keeps
the
earth
alive
it
is
a
huge
power
of
buried
sunlight
that
is
what
it
is
now
think
out
of
that
cauldron
where
all
the
bubbles
would
be
as
big
as
the
alps
if
it
could
get
room
for
its
boiling
certain
bubbles
have
bubbled
out
and
escaped
up
and
away
and
there
they
stand
in
the
cool
cold
sky
mountains
think
of
the
change
and
you
will
no
more
wonder
that
there
should
be
something
awful
about
the
very
look
of
a
mountain
from
the
darkness
for
where
the
light
has
nothing
to
shine
upon
much
the
same
as
darkness
from
the
heat
from
the
endless
tumult
of
boiling
unrest
up
with
a
sudden
heavenward
shoot
into
the
wind
and
the
cold
and
the
starshine
and
a
cloak
of
snow
that
lies
like
ermine
above
the
mail
of
the
glaciers
and
the
great
sun
their
grandfather
up
there
in
the
sky
and
their
little
old
cold
aunt
the
moon
that
comes
wandering
about
the
house
at
night
and
everlasting
stillness
except
for
the
wind
that
turns
the
rocks
and
caverns
into
a
roaring
organ
for
the
young
archangels
that
are
studying
how
to
let
out
the
praises
of
their
hearts
and
the
molten
music
of
the
streams
rushing
ever
from
the
bosoms
of
the
glaciers
fresh
born
think
too
of
the
change
in
their
own
substance
no
longer
molten
and
soft
heaving
and
glowing
but
hard
and
shining
and
cold
think
of
the
creatures
scampering
over
and
burrowing
in
it
and
the
birds
building
their
nests
upon
it
and
the
trees
growing
out
of
its
sides
like
hair
to
clothe
it
and
the
lovely
grass
in
the
valleys
and
the
gracious
flowers
even
at
the
very
edge
of
its
armour
of
ice
like
the
rich
embroidery
of
the
garment
below
and
the
rivers
galloping
down
the
valleys
in
a
tumult
of
white
and
green
and
along
with
all
these
think
of
the
terrible
precipices
down
which
the
traveller
may
fall
and
be
lost
and
the
frightful
gulfs
of
blue
air
cracked
in
the
glaciers
and
the
dark
profound
lakes
covered
like
little
arctic
oceans
with
floating
lumps
of
ice
all
this
outside
the
mountain
but
the
inside
who
shall
tell
what
lies
there
caverns
of
awfullest
solitude
their
walls
miles
thick
sparkling
with
ores
of
gold
or
silver
copper
or
iron
tin
or
mercury
studded
perhaps
with
precious
stones
perhaps
a
brook
with
eyeless
fish
in
it
running
running
ceaselessly
cold
and
babbling
through
banks
crusted
with
carbuncles
and
golden
topazes
or
over
a
gravel
of
which
some
of
the
stones
arc
rubies
and
emeralds
perhaps
diamonds
and
sapphires
who
can
tell
and
whoever
ca
tell
is
free
to
think
all
waiting
to
flash
waiting
for
millions
of
ages
ever
since
the
earth
flew
off
from
the
sun
a
great
blot
of
fire
and
began
to
cool
then
there
are
caverns
full
of
water
numbingly
cold
fiercely
hot
hotter
than
any
boiling
water
from
some
of
these
the
water
can
not
get
out
and
from
others
it
runs
in
channels
as
the
blood
in
the
body
little
veins
bring
it
down
from
the
ice
above
into
the
great
caverns
of
the
mountain
heart
whence
the
arteries
let
it
out
again
gushing
in
pipes
and
clefts
and
ducts
of
all
shapes
and
kinds
through
and
through
its
bulk
until
it
springs
newborn
to
the
light
and
rushes
down
the
mountainside
in
torrents
and
down
the
valleys
in
rivers
down
down
rejoicing
to
the
mighty
lungs
of
the
world
that
is
the
sea
where
it
is
tossed
in
storms
and
cyclones
heaved
up
in
billows
twisted
in
waterspouts
dashed
to
mist
upon
rocks
beaten
by
millions
of
tails
and
breathed
by
millions
of
gills
whence
at
last
melted
into
vapour
by
the
sun
it
is
lifted
up
pure
into
the
air
and
borne
by
the
servant
winds
back
to
the
mountaintops
and
the
snow
the
solid
ice
and
the
molten
stream
well
when
the
heart
of
the
earth
has
thus
come
rushing
up
among
her
children
bringing
with
it
gifts
of
all
that
she
possesses
then
straightway
into
it
rush
her
children
to
see
what
they
can
find
there
with
pickaxe
and
spade
and
crowbar
with
boring
chisel
and
blasting
powder
they
force
their
way
back
is
it
to
search
for
what
toys
they
may
have
left
in
their
nurseries
hence
the
mountains
that
lift
their
heads
into
the
clear
air
and
are
dotted
over
with
the
dwellings
of
men
are
tunnelled
and
bored
in
the
darkness
of
their
bosoms
by
the
dwellers
in
the
houses
which
they
hold
up
to
the
sun
and
air
curdie
and
his
father
were
of
these
their
business
was
to
bring
to
light
hidden
things
they
sought
silver
in
the
rock
and
found
it
and
carried
it
out
of
the
many
other
precious
things
in
their
mountain
they
knew
little
or
nothing
silver
ore
was
what
they
were
sent
to
find
and
in
darkness
and
danger
they
found
it
but
oh
how
sweet
was
the
air
on
the
mountain
face
when
they
came
out
at
sunset
to
go
home
to
wife
and
mother
they
did
breathe
deep
then
the
mines
belonged
to
the
king
of
the
country
and
the
miners
were
his
servants
working
under
his
overseers
and
officers
he
was
a
real
king
that
is
one
who
ruled
for
the
good
of
his
people
and
not
to
please
himself
and
he
wanted
the
silver
not
to
buy
rich
things
for
himself
but
to
help
him
to
govern
the
country
and
pay
the
ones
that
defended
it
from
certain
troublesome
neighbours
and
the
judges
whom
he
set
to
portion
out
righteousness
among
the
people
that
so
they
might
learn
it
themselves
and
come
to
do
without
judges
at
all
nothing
that
could
be
got
from
the
heart
of
the
earth
could
have
been
put
to
better
purposes
than
the
silver
the
king
miners
got
for
him
there
were
people
in
the
country
who
when
it
came
into
their
hands
degraded
it
by
locking
it
up
in
a
chest
and
then
it
grew
diseased
and
was
called
mammon
and
bred
all
sorts
of
quarrels
but
when
first
it
left
the
king
hands
it
never
made
any
but
friends
and
the
air
of
the
world
kept
it
clean
about
a
year
before
this
story
began
a
series
of
very
remarkable
events
had
just
ended
i
will
narrate
as
much
of
them
as
will
serve
to
show
the
tops
of
the
roots
of
my
tree
upon
the
mountain
on
one
of
its
many
claws
stood
a
grand
old
house
half
farmhouse
half
castle
belonging
to
the
king
and
there
his
only
child
the
princess
irene
had
been
brought
up
till
she
was
nearly
nine
years
old
and
would
doubtless
have
continued
much
longer
but
for
the
strange
events
to
which
i
have
referred
at
that
time
the
hollow
places
of
the
mountain
were
inhabited
by
creatures
called
goblins
who
for
various
reasons
and
in
various
ways
made
themselves
troublesome
to
all
but
to
the
little
princess
dangerous
mainly
by
the
watchful
devotion
and
energy
of
curdie
however
their
designs
had
been
utterly
defeated
and
made
to
recoil
upon
themselves
to
their
own
destruction
so
that
now
there
were
very
few
of
them
left
alive
and
the
miners
did
not
believe
there
was
a
single
goblin
remaining
in
the
whole
inside
of
the
mountain
the
king
had
been
so
pleased
with
the
boy
then
approaching
thirteen
years
of
age
that
when
he
carried
away
his
daughter
he
asked
him
to
accompany
them
but
he
was
still
better
pleased
with
him
when
he
found
that
he
preferred
staying
with
his
father
and
mother
he
was
a
right
good
king
and
knew
that
the
love
of
a
boy
who
would
not
leave
his
father
and
mother
to
be
made
a
great
man
was
worth
ten
thousand
offers
to
die
for
his
sake
and
would
prove
so
when
the
right
time
came
as
for
his
father
and
mother
they
would
have
given
him
up
without
a
grumble
for
they
were
just
as
good
as
the
king
and
he
and
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
but
in
this
matter
not
seeing
that
he
could
do
anything
for
the
king
which
one
of
his
numerous
attendants
could
not
do
as
well
curdie
felt
that
it
was
for
him
to
decide
so
the
king
took
a
kind
farewell
of
them
all
and
rode
away
with
his
daughter
on
his
horse
before
him
a
gloom
fell
upon
the
mountain
and
the
miners
when
she
was
gone
and
curdie
did
not
whistle
for
a
whole
week
as
for
his
verses
there
was
no
occasion
to
make
any
now
he
had
made
them
only
to
drive
away
the
goblins
and
they
were
all
gone
a
good
riddance
only
the
princess
was
gone
too
he
would
rather
have
had
things
as
they
were
except
for
the
princess
sake
but
whoever
is
diligent
will
soon
be
cheerful
and
though
the
miners
missed
the
household
of
the
castle
they
yet
managed
to
get
on
without
them
peter
and
his
wife
however
were
troubled
with
the
fancy
that
they
had
stood
in
the
way
of
their
boy
good
fortune
it
would
have
been
such
a
fine
thing
for
him
and
them
too
they
thought
if
he
had
ridden
with
the
good
king
train
how
beautiful
he
looked
they
said
when
he
rode
the
king
own
horse
through
the
river
that
the
goblins
had
sent
out
of
the
hill
he
might
soon
have
been
a
captain
they
did
believe
the
good
kind
people
did
not
reflect
that
the
road
to
the
next
duty
is
the
only
straight
one
or
that
for
their
fancied
good
we
should
never
wish
our
children
or
friends
to
do
what
we
would
not
do
ourselves
if
we
were
in
their
position
we
must
accept
righteous
sacrifices
as
well
as
make
them
chapter
the
white
pigeon
when
in
the
winter
they
had
had
their
supper
and
sat
about
the
fire
or
when
in
the
summer
they
lay
on
the
border
of
the
stream
that
ran
through
their
little
meadow
close
by
the
door
of
their
cottage
issuing
from
the
whiteness
often
folded
in
clouds
curdie
mother
would
not
seldom
lead
the
conversation
to
one
peculiar
personage
said
and
believed
to
have
been
much
concerned
in
the
late
issue
of
events
that
personage
was
the
of
the
princess
of
whom
the
princess
had
often
talked
but
whom
neither
curdie
nor
his
mother
had
ever
seen
curdie
could
indeed
remember
although
already
it
looked
more
like
a
dream
than
he
could
account
for
if
it
had
really
taken
place
how
the
princess
had
once
led
him
up
many
stairs
to
what
she
called
a
beautiful
room
in
the
top
of
the
tower
where
she
went
through
all
the
what
should
he
call
it
the
behaviour
of
presenting
him
to
her
grandmother
talking
now
to
her
and
now
to
him
while
all
the
time
he
saw
nothing
but
a
bare
garret
a
heap
of
musty
straw
a
sunbeam
and
a
withered
apple
lady
he
would
have
declared
before
the
king
himself
young
or
old
there
was
none
except
the
princess
herself
who
was
certainly
vexed
that
he
could
not
see
what
she
at
least
believed
she
saw
as
for
his
mother
she
had
once
seen
long
before
curdie
was
born
a
certain
mysterious
light
of
the
same
description
as
one
irene
spoke
of
calling
it
her
grandmother
moon
and
curdie
himself
had
seen
this
same
light
shining
from
above
the
castle
just
as
the
king
and
princess
were
taking
their
leave
since
that
time
neither
had
seen
or
heard
anything
that
could
be
supposed
connected
with
her
strangely
enough
however
nobody
had
seen
her
go
away
if
she
was
such
an
old
lady
she
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
have
set
out
alone
and
on
foot
when
all
the
house
was
asleep
still
away
she
must
have
gone
for
of
course
if
she
was
so
powerful
she
would
always
be
about
the
princess
to
take
care
of
her
but
as
curdie
grew
older
he
doubted
more
and
more
whether
irene
had
not
been
talking
of
some
dream
she
had
taken
for
reality
he
had
heard
it
said
that
children
could
not
always
distinguish
betwixt
dreams
and
actual
events
at
the
same
time
there
was
his
mother
testimony
what
was
he
to
do
with
that
his
mother
through
whom
he
had
learned
everything
could
hardly
be
imagined
by
her
own
dutiful
son
to
have
mistaken
a
dream
for
a
fact
of
the
waking
world
so
he
rather
shrank
from
thinking
about
it
and
the
less
he
thought
about
it
the
less
he
was
inclined
to
believe
it
when
he
did
think
about
it
and
therefore
of
course
the
less
inclined
to
talk
about
it
to
his
father
and
mother
for
although
his
father
was
one
of
those
men
who
for
one
word
they
say
think
twenty
thoughts
curdie
was
well
assured
that
he
would
rather
doubt
his
own
eyes
than
his
testimony
there
were
no
others
to
whom
he
could
have
talked
about
it
the
miners
were
a
mingled
company
some
good
some
not
so
good
some
rather
bad
none
of
them
so
bad
or
so
good
as
they
might
have
been
curdie
liked
most
of
them
and
was
a
favourite
with
all
but
they
knew
very
little
about
the
upper
world
and
what
might
or
might
not
take
place
there
they
knew
silver
from
copper
ore
they
understood
the
underground
ways
of
things
and
they
could
look
very
wise
with
their
lanterns
in
their
hands
searching
after
this
or
that
sign
of
ore
or
for
some
mark
to
guide
their
way
in
the
hollows
of
the
earth
but
as
to
they
would
have
mocked
curdie
all
the
rest
of
his
life
for
the
absurdity
of
not
being
absolutely
certain
that
the
solemn
belief
of
his
father
and
mother
was
nothing
but
ridiculous
nonsense
why
to
them
the
very
word
would
have
been
a
week
laughter
i
am
not
sure
that
they
were
able
quite
to
believe
there
were
such
persons
as
they
had
never
seen
one
they
were
not
companions
to
give
the
best
of
help
toward
progress
and
as
curdie
grew
he
grew
at
this
time
faster
in
body
than
in
mind
with
the
usual
consequence
that
he
was
getting
rather
stupid
one
of
the
chief
signs
of
which
was
that
he
believed
less
and
less
in
things
he
had
never
seen
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
think
he
was
ever
so
stupid
as
to
imagine
that
this
was
a
sign
of
superior
faculty
and
strength
of
mind
still
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
miner
and
less
and
less
a
man
of
the
upper
world
where
the
wind
blew
on
his
way
to
and
from
the
mine
he
took
less
and
less
notice
of
bees
and
butterflies
moths
and
dragonflies
the
flowers
and
the
brooks
and
the
clouds
he
was
gradually
changing
into
a
commonplace
man
there
is
this
difference
between
the
growth
of
some
human
beings
and
that
of
others
in
the
one
case
it
is
a
continuous
dying
in
the
other
a
continuous
resurrection
one
of
the
latter
sort
comes
at
length
to
know
at
once
whether
a
thing
is
true
the
moment
it
comes
before
him
one
of
the
former
class
grows
more
and
more
afraid
of
being
taken
in
so
afraid
of
it
that
he
takes
himself
in
altogether
and
comes
at
length
to
believe
in
nothing
but
his
dinner
to
be
sure
of
a
thing
with
him
is
to
have
it
between
his
teeth
curdie
was
not
in
a
very
good
way
then
at
that
time
his
father
and
mother
had
it
is
true
no
fault
to
find
with
him
and
yet
and
yet
neither
of
them
was
ready
to
sing
when
the
thought
of
him
came
up
there
must
be
something
wrong
when
a
mother
catches
herself
sighing
over
the
time
when
her
boy
was
in
petticoats
or
a
father
looks
sad
when
he
thinks
how
he
used
to
carry
him
on
his
shoulder
the
boy
should
enclose
and
keep
as
his
life
the
old
child
at
the
heart
of
him
and
never
let
it
go
he
must
still
to
be
a
right
man
be
his
mother
darling
and
more
his
father
pride
and
more
the
child
is
not
meant
to
die
but
to
be
forever
fresh
born
curdie
had
made
himself
a
bow
and
some
arrows
and
was
teaching
himself
to
shoot
with
them
one
evening
in
the
early
summer
as
he
was
walking
home
from
the
mine
with
them
in
his
hand
a
light
flashed
across
his
eyes
he
looked
and
there
was
a
pigeon
settling
on
a
rock
in
front
of
him
in
the
red
light
of
the
level
sun
there
it
fell
at
once
to
work
with
one
of
its
wings
in
which
a
feather
or
two
had
got
some
sprays
twisted
causing
a
certain
roughness
unpleasant
to
the
fastidious
creature
of
the
air
it
was
indeed
a
lovely
being
and
curdie
thought
how
happy
it
must
be
flitting
through
the
air
with
a
flash
a
live
bolt
of
light
for
a
moment
he
became
so
one
with
the
bird
that
he
seemed
to
feel
both
its
bill
and
its
feathers
as
the
one
adjusted
the
other
to
fly
again
and
his
heart
swelled
with
the
pleasure
of
its
involuntary
sympathy
another
moment
and
it
would
have
been
aloft
in
the
waves
of
rosy
light
it
was
just
bending
its
little
legs
to
spring
that
moment
it
fell
on
the
path
and
bleeding
from
curdie
cruel
arrow
with
a
gush
of
pride
at
his
skill
and
pleasure
at
his
success
he
ran
to
pick
up
his
prey
i
must
say
for
him
he
picked
it
up
gently
perhaps
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
repentance
but
when
he
had
the
white
thing
in
his
hands
its
whiteness
stained
with
another
red
than
that
of
the
sunset
flood
in
which
it
had
been
revelling
ah
god
who
knows
the
joy
of
a
bird
the
ecstasy
of
a
creature
that
has
neither
storehouse
nor
barn
when
he
held
it
i
say
in
his
victorious
hands
the
winged
thing
looked
up
in
his
face
and
with
such
eyes
asking
what
was
the
matter
and
where
the
red
sun
had
gone
and
the
clouds
and
the
wind
of
its
flight
then
they
closed
but
to
open
again
presently
with
the
same
questions
in
them
and
as
they
closed
and
opened
their
look
was
fixed
on
his
it
did
not
once
flutter
or
try
to
get
away
it
only
throbbed
and
bled
and
looked
at
him
curdie
heart
began
to
grow
very
large
in
his
bosom
what
could
it
mean
it
was
nothing
but
a
pigeon
and
why
should
he
not
kill
a
pigeon
but
the
fact
was
that
not
till
this
very
moment
had
he
ever
known
what
a
pigeon
was
a
good
many
discoveries
of
a
similar
kind
have
to
be
made
by
most
of
us
once
more
it
opened
its
eyes
then
closed
them
again
and
its
throbbing
ceased
curdie
gave
a
sob
its
last
look
reminded
him
of
the
princess
he
did
not
know
why
he
remembered
how
hard
he
had
laboured
to
set
her
beyond
danger
and
yet
what
dangers
she
had
had
to
encounter
for
his
sake
they
had
been
saviours
to
each
other
and
what
had
he
done
now
he
had
stopped
saving
and
had
begun
killing
what
had
he
been
sent
into
the
world
for
surely
not
to
be
a
death
to
its
joy
and
loveliness
he
had
done
the
thing
that
was
contrary
to
gladness
he
was
a
destroyer
he
was
not
the
curdie
he
had
been
meant
to
be
then
the
underground
waters
gushed
from
the
boy
heart
and
with
the
tears
came
the
remembrance
that
a
white
pigeon
just
before
the
princess
went
away
with
her
father
came
from
somewhere
yes
from
the
grandmother
lamp
and
flew
round
the
king
and
irene
and
himself
and
then
flew
away
this
might
be
that
very
pigeon
horrible
to
think
and
if
it
was
yet
it
was
a
white
pigeon
the
same
as
this
and
if
she
kept
a
great
many
pigeons
and
white
ones
as
irene
had
told
him
then
whose
pigeon
could
he
have
killed
but
the
grand
old
princess
suddenly
everything
round
about
him
seemed
against
him
the
red
sunset
stung
him
the
rocks
frowned
at
him
the
sweet
wind
that
had
been
laving
his
face
as
he
walked
up
the
hill
dropped
as
if
he
was
fit
to
be
kissed
any
more
was
the
whole
world
going
to
cast
him
out
would
he
have
to
stand
there
forever
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
the
dead
pigeon
in
his
hand
things
looked
bad
indeed
was
the
whole
world
going
to
make
a
work
about
a
pigeon
a
white
pigeon
the
sun
went
down
great
clouds
gathered
over
the
west
and
shortened
the
twilight
the
wind
gave
a
howl
and
then
lay
down
again
the
clouds
gathered
thicker
then
came
a
rumbling
he
thought
it
was
thunder
it
was
a
rock
that
fell
inside
the
mountain
a
goat
ran
past
him
down
the
hill
followed
by
a
dog
sent
to
fetch
him
home
he
thought
they
were
goblin
creatures
and
trembled
he
used
to
despise
them
and
still
he
held
the
dead
pigeon
tenderly
in
his
hand
it
grew
darker
and
darker
an
evil
something
began
to
move
in
his
heart
a
fool
i
am
he
said
to
himself
then
he
grew
angry
and
was
just
going
to
throw
the
bird
from
him
and
whistle
when
a
brightness
shone
all
round
him
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
a
great
globe
of
light
like
silver
at
the
hottest
heat
he
had
once
seen
silver
run
from
the
furnace
it
shone
from
somewhere
above
the
roofs
of
the
castle
it
must
be
the
great
old
princess
moon
how
could
she
be
there
of
course
she
was
not
there
he
had
asked
the
whole
household
and
nobody
knew
anything
about
her
or
her
globe
either
it
could
be
and
yet
what
did
that
signify
when
there
was
the
white
globe
shining
and
here
was
the
dead
white
bird
in
his
hand
that
moment
the
pigeon
gave
a
little
flutter
not
dead
cried
curdie
almost
with
a
shriek
the
same
instant
he
was
running
full
speed
toward
the
castle
never
letting
his
heels
down
lest
he
should
shake
the
poor
wounded
bird
chapter
the
mistress
of
the
silver
moon
when
curdie
reached
the
castle
and
ran
into
the
little
garden
in
front
of
it
there
stood
the
door
wide
open
this
was
as
he
had
hoped
for
what
could
he
have
said
if
he
had
had
to
knock
at
it
those
whose
business
it
is
to
open
doors
so
often
mistake
and
shut
them
but
the
woman
now
in
charge
often
puzzled
herself
greatly
to
account
for
the
strange
fact
that
however
often
she
shut
the
door
which
like
the
rest
she
took
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
to
do
she
was
certain
the
next
time
she
went
to
it
to
find
it
open
i
speak
now
of
the
great
front
door
of
course
the
back
door
she
as
persistently
kept
wide
if
people
could
only
go
in
by
that
she
said
she
would
then
know
what
sort
they
were
and
what
they
wanted
but
she
would
neither
have
known
what
sort
curdie
was
nor
what
he
wanted
and
would
assuredly
have
denied
him
admittance
for
she
knew
nothing
of
who
was
in
the
tower
so
the
front
door
was
left
open
for
him
and
in
he
walked
but
where
to
go
next
he
could
not
tell
it
was
not
quite
dark
a
dull
shineless
twilight
filled
the
place
all
he
knew
was
that
he
must
go
up
and
that
proved
enough
for
the
present
for
there
he
saw
the
great
staircase
rising
before
him
when
he
reached
the
top
of
it
he
knew
there
must
be
more
stairs
yet
for
he
could
not
be
near
the
top
of
the
tower
indeed
by
the
situation
of
the
stairs
he
must
be
a
good
way
from
the
tower
itself
but
those
who
work
well
in
the
depths
more
easily
understand
the
heights
for
indeed
in
their
true
nature
they
are
one
and
the
same
miners
are
in
mountains
and
curdie
from
knowing
the
ways
of
the
king
mines
and
being
able
to
calculate
his
whereabouts
in
them
was
now
able
to
find
his
way
about
the
king
house
he
knew
its
outside
perfectly
and
now
his
business
was
to
get
his
notion
of
the
inside
right
with
the
outside
so
he
shut
his
eyes
and
made
a
picture
of
the
outside
of
it
in
his
mind
then
he
came
in
at
the
door
of
the
picture
and
yet
kept
the
picture
before
him
all
the
time
for
you
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
in
your
mind
and
took
every
turn
of
the
stair
over
again
always
watching
to
remember
every
time
he
turned
his
face
how
the
tower
lay
and
then
when
he
came
to
himself
at
the
top
where
he
stood
he
knew
exactly
where
it
was
and
walked
at
once
in
the
right
direction
on
his
way
however
he
came
to
another
stair
and
up
that
he
went
of
course
watching
still
at
every
turn
how
the
tower
must
lie
at
the
top
of
this
stair
was
yet
another
they
were
the
stairs
up
which
the
princess
ran
when
first
without
knowing
it
she
was
on
her
way
to
find
her
at
the
top
of
the
second
stair
he
could
go
no
farther
and
must
therefore
set
out
again
to
find
the
tower
which
as
it
rose
far
above
the
rest
of
the
house
must
have
the
last
of
its
stairs
inside
itself
having
watched
every
turn
to
the
very
last
he
still
knew
quite
well
in
what
direction
he
must
go
to
find
it
so
he
left
the
stair
and
went
down
a
passage
that
led
if
not
exactly
toward
it
yet
nearer
it
this
passage
was
rather
dark
for
it
was
very
long
with
only
one
window
at
the
end
and
although
there
were
doors
on
both
sides
of
it
they
were
all
shut
at
the
distant
window
glimmered
the
chill
east
with
a
few
feeble
stars
in
it
and
its
like
was
dreary
and
old
growing
brown
and
looking
as
if
it
were
thinking
about
the
day
that
was
just
gone
presently
he
turned
into
another
passage
which
also
had
a
window
at
the
end
of
it
and
in
at
that
window
shone
all
that
was
left
of
the
sunset
just
a
few
ashes
with
here
and
there
a
little
touch
of
warmth
it
was
nearly
as
sad
as
the
east
only
there
was
one
difference
it
was
very
plainly
thinking
of
tomorrow
but
at
present
curdie
had
nothing
to
do
with
today
or
tomorrow
his
business
was
with
the
bird
and
the
tower
where
dwelt
the
grand
old
princess
to
whom
it
belonged
so
he
kept
on
his
way
still
eastward
and
came
to
yet
another
passage
which
brought
him
to
a
door
he
was
afraid
to
open
it
without
first
knocking
he
knocked
but
heard
no
answer
he
was
answered
nevertheless
for
the
door
gently
opened
and
there
was
a
narrow
stair
and
so
steep
that
big
lad
as
he
was
he
too
like
the
princess
irene
before
him
found
his
hands
needful
for
the
climbing
and
it
was
a
long
climb
but
he
reached
the
top
at
last
a
little
landing
with
a
door
in
front
and
one
on
each
side
which
should
he
knock
at
as
he
hesitated
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
spinning
wheel
he
knew
it
at
once
because
his
mother
spinning
wheel
had
been
his
governess
long
ago
and
still
taught
him
things
it
was
the
spinning
wheel
that
first
taught
him
to
make
verses
and
to
sing
and
to
think
whether
all
was
right
inside
him
or
at
least
it
had
helped
him
in
all
these
things
hence
it
was
no
wonder
he
should
know
a
spinning
wheel
when
he
heard
it
sing
even
although
as
the
bird
of
paradise
to
other
birds
was
the
song
of
that
wheel
to
the
song
of
his
mother
he
stood
listening
so
entranced
that
he
forgot
to
knock
and
the
wheel
went
on
and
on
spinning
in
his
brain
songs
and
tales
and
rhymes
till
he
was
almost
asleep
as
well
as
dreaming
for
sleep
does
not
always
come
first
but
suddenly
came
the
thought
of
the
poor
bird
which
had
been
lying
motionless
in
his
hand
all
the
time
and
that
woke
him
up
and
at
once
he
knocked
in
curdie
said
a
voice
curdie
shook
it
was
getting
rather
awful
the
heart
that
had
never
much
heeded
an
army
of
goblins
trembled
at
the
soft
word
of
invitation
but
then
there
was
the
white
thing
in
his
hand
he
dared
not
hesitate
though
gently
he
opened
the
door
through
which
the
sound
came
and
what
did
he
see
nothing
at
first
except
indeed
a
great
sloping
shaft
of
moonlight
that
came
in
at
a
high
window
and
rested
on
the
floor
he
stood
and
stared
at
it
forgetting
to
shut
the
door
do
you
come
in
curdie
said
the
voice
you
never
see
moonlight
before
without
a
moon
answered
curdie
in
a
trembling
tone
but
gathering
courage
not
returned
the
voice
which
was
thin
and
quavering
never
saw
moonlight
without
a
moon
there
no
moon
outside
said
curdie
but
you
inside
now
said
the
voice
the
answer
did
not
satisfy
curdie
but
the
voice
went
on
are
more
moons
than
you
know
of
curdie
where
there
is
one
sun
there
are
many
moons
and
of
many
sorts
come
in
and
look
out
of
my
window
and
you
will
soon
satisfy
yourself
that
there
is
a
moon
looking
in
at
it
the
gentleness
of
the
voice
made
curdie
remember
his
manners
he
shut
the
door
and
drew
a
step
or
two
nearer
to
the
moonlight
all
the
time
the
sound
of
the
spinning
had
been
going
on
and
on
and
curdie
now
caught
sight
of
the
wheel
oh
it
was
such
a
thin
delicate
thing
reminding
him
of
a
spider
web
in
a
hedge
it
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlight
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
moonlight
had
nearly
melted
it
away
a
step
nearer
he
saw
with
a
start
two
little
hands
at
work
with
it
and
then
at
last
in
the
shadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
moonlight
which
came
like
silver
between
he
saw
the
form
to
which
the
hands
belonged
a
small
withered
creature
so
old
that
no
age
would
have
seemed
too
great
to
write
under
her
picture
seated
on
a
stool
beyond
the
spinning
wheel
which
looked
very
large
beside
her
but
as
i
said
very
thin
like
a
spider
holding
up
its
own
web
which
was
the
round
wheel
itself
she
sat
crumpled
together
a
filmy
thing
that
it
seemed
a
puff
would
blow
away
more
like
the
body
of
a
fly
the
big
spider
had
sucked
empty
and
left
hanging
in
his
web
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
when
curdie
saw
her
he
stood
still
again
a
good
deal
in
wonder
a
very
little
in
reverence
a
little
in
doubt
and
i
must
add
a
little
in
amusement
at
the
odd
look
of
the
old
marvel
her
grey
hair
mixed
with
the
moonlight
so
that
he
could
not
tell
where
the
one
began
and
the
other
ended
her
crooked
back
bent
forward
over
her
chest
her
shoulders
nearly
swallowed
up
her
head
between
them
and
her
two
little
hands
were
just
like
the
grey
claws
of
a
hen
scratching
at
the
thread
which
to
curdie
was
of
course
invisible
across
the
moonlight
indeed
curdie
laughed
within
himself
just
a
little
at
the
sight
and
when
he
thought
of
how
the
princess
used
to
talk
about
her
huge
great
old
grandmother
he
laughed
more
but
that
moment
the
little
lady
leaned
forward
into
the
moonlight
and
curdie
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
eyes
and
all
the
laugh
went
out
of
him
do
you
come
here
for
curdie
she
said
as
gently
as
before
then
curdie
remembered
that
he
stood
there
as
a
culprit
and
worst
of
all
as
one
who
had
his
confession
yet
to
make
there
was
no
time
to
hesitate
over
it
see
here
he
said
and
advanced
a
step
or
two
holding
out
the
pigeon
have
you
got
there
she
asked
again
curdie
advanced
a
few
steps
and
held
out
his
hand
with
the
pigeon
that
she
might
see
what
it
was
into
the
moonlight
the
moment
the
rays
fell
upon
it
the
pigeon
gave
a
faint
flutter
the
old
lady
put
out
her
old
hands
and
took
it
and
held
it
to
her
bosom
and
rocked
it
murmuring
over
it
as
if
it
were
a
sick
baby
when
curdie
saw
how
distressed
she
was
he
grew
sorrier
still
and
said
did
mean
to
do
any
harm
i
did
think
of
its
being
yours
curdie
if
it
were
mine
what
would
become
of
it
now
she
returned
say
you
did
mean
any
harm
did
you
mean
any
good
curdie
answered
curdie
then
that
whoever
does
not
mean
good
is
always
in
danger
of
harm
but
i
try
to
give
everybody
fair
play
and
those
that
are
in
the
wrong
are
in
far
more
need
of
it
always
than
those
who
are
in
the
right
they
can
afford
to
do
without
it
therefore
i
say
for
you
that
when
you
shot
that
arrow
you
did
not
know
what
a
pigeon
is
now
that
you
do
know
you
are
sorry
it
is
very
dangerous
to
do
things
you
do
know
about
please
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
or
to
contradict
you
said
curdie
if
a
body
was
never
to
do
anything
but
what
he
knew
to
be
good
he
would
have
to
live
half
his
time
doing
nothing
you
are
much
mistaken
said
the
old
quavering
voice
little
you
must
have
thought
why
you
do
seem
even
to
know
the
good
of
the
things
you
are
constantly
doing
now
do
mistake
me
i
do
mean
you
are
good
for
doing
them
it
is
a
good
thing
to
eat
your
breakfast
but
you
do
fancy
it
very
good
of
you
to
do
it
the
thing
is
good
not
you
curdie
laughed
are
a
great
many
more
good
things
than
bad
things
to
do
now
tell
me
what
bad
thing
you
have
done
today
besides
this
sore
hurt
to
my
little
white
friend
while
she
talked
curdie
had
sunk
into
a
sort
of
reverie
in
which
he
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
the
old
lady
or
his
own
heart
that
spoke
and
when
she
asked
him
that
question
he
was
at
first
much
inclined
to
consider
himself
a
very
good
fellow
on
the
whole
really
think
i
did
anything
else
that
was
very
bad
all
day
he
said
to
himself
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
honestly
feel
that
he
was
worth
standing
up
for
all
at
once
a
light
seemed
to
break
in
upon
his
mind
and
he
woke
up
and
there
was
the
withered
little
atomy
of
the
old
lady
on
the
other
side
of
the
moonlight
and
there
was
the
spinning
wheel
singing
on
and
on
in
the
middle
of
it
know
now
i
understand
now
he
said
you
for
spinning
it
into
me
with
your
wheel
i
see
now
that
i
have
been
doing
wrong
the
whole
day
and
such
a
many
days
besides
indeed
i
do
know
when
i
ever
did
right
and
yet
it
seems
as
if
i
had
done
right
some
time
and
had
forgotten
how
when
i
killed
your
bird
i
did
not
know
i
was
doing
wrong
just
because
i
was
always
doing
wrong
and
the
wrong
had
soaked
all
through
me
wrong
were
you
doing
all
day
curdie
it
is
better
to
come
to
the
point
you
know
said
the
old
lady
and
her
voice
was
gentler
even
than
before
was
doing
the
wrong
of
never
wanting
or
trying
to
be
better
and
now
i
see
that
i
have
been
letting
things
go
as
they
would
for
a
long
time
whatever
came
into
my
head
i
did
and
whatever
did
come
into
my
head
i
did
do
i
never
sent
anything
away
and
never
looked
out
for
anything
to
come
i
have
been
attending
to
my
mother
or
my
father
either
and
now
i
think
of
it
i
know
i
have
often
seen
them
looking
troubled
and
i
have
never
asked
them
what
was
the
matter
and
now
i
see
too
that
i
did
not
ask
because
i
suspected
it
had
something
to
do
with
me
and
my
behaviour
and
did
want
to
hear
the
truth
and
i
know
i
have
been
grumbling
at
my
work
and
doing
a
hundred
other
things
that
are
wrong
have
got
it
curdie
said
the
old
lady
in
a
voice
that
sounded
almost
as
if
she
had
been
crying
people
do
care
to
be
better
they
must
be
doing
everything
wrong
i
am
so
glad
you
shot
my
bird
exclaimed
curdie
can
you
be
it
has
brought
you
to
see
what
sort
you
were
when
you
did
it
and
what
sort
you
will
grow
to
be
again
only
worse
if
you
do
mind
now
that
you
are
sorry
my
poor
bird
will
be
better
look
up
my
dovey
the
pigeon
gave
a
flutter
and
spread
out
one
of
its
wings
across
the
old
woman
bosom
will
mend
the
little
angel
she
said
in
a
week
or
two
it
will
be
flying
again
so
you
may
ease
your
heart
about
the
pigeon
thank
you
thank
you
cried
curdie
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
will
tell
you
there
is
only
one
way
i
care
for
do
better
and
grow
better
and
be
better
and
never
kill
anything
without
a
good
reason
for
it
i
will
go
and
fetch
my
bow
and
arrows
and
you
shall
burn
them
yourself
have
no
fire
that
would
burn
your
bow
and
arrows
curdie
i
promise
you
to
burn
them
all
under
my
mother
porridge
pot
tomorrow
morning
no
curdie
keep
them
and
practice
with
them
every
day
and
grow
a
good
shot
there
are
plenty
of
bad
things
that
want
killing
and
a
day
will
come
when
they
will
prove
useful
but
i
must
see
first
whether
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
i
will
said
curdie
is
it
something
not
to
do
answered
the
old
lady
you
should
hear
anyone
speak
about
me
never
to
laugh
or
make
fun
of
me
exclaimed
curdie
shocked
that
she
should
think
such
a
request
needful
stop
she
went
on
hereabout
sometimes
tell
very
odd
and
in
fact
ridiculous
stories
of
an
old
woman
who
watches
what
is
going
on
and
occasionally
interferes
they
mean
me
though
what
they
say
is
often
great
nonsense
now
what
i
want
of
you
is
not
to
laugh
or
side
with
them
in
any
way
because
they
will
take
that
to
mean
that
you
do
believe
there
is
any
such
person
a
bit
more
than
they
do
now
that
would
not
be
the
case
would
it
curdie
indeed
i
seen
you
the
old
woman
smiled
very
oddly
you
seen
me
she
said
mind
she
continued
want
you
to
say
anything
only
to
hold
your
tongue
and
not
seem
to
side
with
them
will
be
easy
curdie
that
i
seen
you
with
my
very
own
eyes
so
easy
as
you
think
perhaps
said
the
old
lady
with
another
curious
smile
want
to
be
your
friend
she
added
after
a
little
pause
i
do
quite
know
yet
whether
you
will
let
me
i
will
said
curdie
is
for
me
to
find
out
she
rejoined
with
yet
another
strange
smile
the
meantime
all
i
can
say
is
come
to
me
again
when
you
find
yourself
in
any
trouble
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
only
the
canning
depends
on
yourself
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
you
for
bringing
me
my
pigeon
doing
your
best
to
set
right
what
you
had
set
wrong
as
she
spoke
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
when
he
took
it
she
made
use
of
his
to
help
herself
up
from
her
stool
and
when
or
how
it
came
about
curdie
could
not
tell
the
same
instant
she
stood
before
him
a
tall
strong
woman
plainly
very
old
but
as
grand
as
she
was
old
and
only
rather
every
trace
of
the
decrepitude
and
witheredness
she
showed
as
she
hovered
like
a
film
about
her
wheel
had
vanished
her
hair
was
very
white
but
it
hung
about
her
head
in
great
plenty
and
shone
like
silver
in
the
moonlight
straight
as
a
pillar
she
stood
before
the
astonished
boy
and
the
wounded
bird
had
now
spread
out
both
its
wings
across
her
bosom
like
some
great
mystical
ornament
of
frosted
silver
now
i
can
never
forget
you
cried
curdie
see
now
what
you
really
are
i
not
tell
you
the
truth
when
i
sat
at
my
wheel
said
the
old
lady
answered
curdie
can
do
no
more
than
tell
you
the
truth
now
she
rejoined
is
a
bad
thing
indeed
to
forget
one
who
has
told
us
the
truth
now
go
curdie
obeyed
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
what
am
i
to
call
you
he
was
going
to
say
but
when
he
turned
to
speak
he
saw
nobody
whether
she
was
there
or
not
he
could
not
tell
however
for
the
moonlight
had
vanished
and
the
room
was
utterly
dark
a
great
fear
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
came
upon
him
and
almost
overwhelmed
him
he
groped
his
way
to
the
door
and
crawled
down
the
stair
in
doubt
and
anxiety
as
to
how
he
should
find
his
way
out
of
the
house
in
the
dark
and
the
stair
seemed
ever
so
much
longer
than
when
he
came
up
nor
was
that
any
wonder
for
down
and
down
he
went
until
at
length
his
foot
struck
a
door
and
when
he
rose
and
opened
it
he
found
himself
under
the
starry
moonless
sky
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
he
soon
discovered
the
way
out
of
the
garden
with
which
he
had
some
acquaintance
already
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
climbing
the
mountain
with
a
solemn
and
cheerful
heart
it
was
rather
dark
but
he
knew
the
way
well
as
he
passed
the
rock
from
which
the
poor
pigeon
fell
wounded
with
his
arrow
a
great
joy
filled
his
heart
at
the
thought
that
he
was
delivered
from
the
blood
of
the
little
bird
and
he
ran
the
next
hundred
yards
at
full
speed
up
the
hill
some
dark
shadows
passed
him
he
did
not
even
care
to
think
what
they
were
but
let
them
run
when
he
reached
home
he
found
his
father
and
mother
waiting
supper
for
him
chapter
curdie
father
and
mother
the
eyes
of
the
fathers
and
mothers
are
quick
to
read
their
looks
and
when
curdie
entered
the
cottage
his
parents
saw
at
once
that
something
unusual
had
taken
place
when
he
said
to
his
mother
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
late
there
was
something
in
the
tone
beyond
the
politeness
that
went
to
her
heart
for
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
place
where
all
lovely
things
were
born
before
they
began
to
grow
in
this
world
when
he
set
his
father
chair
to
the
table
an
attention
he
had
not
shown
him
for
a
long
time
peter
thanked
him
with
more
gratitude
than
the
boy
had
ever
yet
felt
in
all
his
life
it
was
a
small
thing
to
do
for
the
man
who
had
been
serving
him
since
ever
he
was
born
but
i
suspect
there
is
nothing
a
man
can
be
so
grateful
for
as
that
to
which
he
has
the
most
right
there
was
a
change
upon
curdie
and
father
and
mother
felt
there
must
be
something
to
account
for
it
and
therefore
were
pretty
sure
he
had
something
to
tell
them
for
when
a
child
heart
is
all
right
it
is
not
likely
he
will
want
to
keep
anything
from
his
parents
but
the
story
of
the
evening
was
too
solemn
for
curdie
to
come
out
with
all
at
once
he
must
wait
until
they
had
had
their
porridge
and
the
affairs
of
this
world
were
over
for
the
day
but
when
they
were
seated
on
the
grassy
bank
of
the
brook
that
went
so
sweetly
blundering
over
the
great
stones
of
its
rocky
channel
for
the
whole
meadow
lay
on
the
top
of
a
huge
rock
then
he
felt
that
the
right
hour
had
come
for
sharing
with
them
the
wonderful
things
that
had
come
to
him
it
was
perhaps
the
loveliest
of
all
hours
in
the
year
the
summer
was
young
and
soft
and
this
was
the
warmest
evening
they
had
yet
had
dusky
dark
even
below
while
above
the
stars
were
bright
and
large
and
sharp
in
the
blackest
blue
sky
the
night
came
close
around
them
clasping
them
in
one
universal
arm
of
love
and
although
it
neither
spoke
nor
smiled
seemed
all
eye
and
ear
seemed
to
see
and
hear
and
know
everything
they
said
and
did
it
is
a
way
the
night
has
sometimes
and
there
is
a
reason
for
it
the
only
sound
was
that
of
the
brook
for
there
was
no
wind
and
no
trees
for
it
to
make
its
music
upon
if
there
had
been
for
the
cottage
was
high
up
on
the
mountain
on
a
great
shoulder
of
stone
where
trees
would
not
grow
there
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
water
as
it
hurried
down
to
the
valley
and
the
sea
talking
busily
of
a
thousand
true
things
which
it
could
not
understand
curdie
told
his
tale
outside
and
in
to
his
father
and
mother
what
a
world
had
slipped
in
between
the
mouth
of
the
mine
and
his
mother
cottage
neither
of
them
said
a
word
until
he
had
ended
what
am
i
to
make
of
it
mother
it
so
strange
he
said
and
stopped
easy
enough
to
see
what
curdie
has
got
to
make
of
it
is
it
peter
said
the
good
woman
turning
her
face
toward
all
she
could
see
of
her
husband
seems
so
to
me
answered
peter
with
a
smile
which
only
the
night
saw
but
his
wife
felt
in
the
tone
of
his
words
they
were
the
happiest
couple
in
that
country
because
they
always
understood
each
other
and
that
was
because
they
always
meant
the
same
thing
and
that
was
because
they
always
loved
what
was
fair
and
true
and
right
better
not
than
anything
else
but
than
everything
else
put
together
will
you
tell
curdie
said
she
can
talk
best
joan
said
he
tell
him
and
i
will
listen
and
learn
how
to
say
what
i
think
he
added
said
curdie
know
what
to
think
does
not
matter
so
much
said
his
mother
only
you
know
what
to
make
of
a
thing
you
know
soon
enough
what
to
think
of
it
now
i
need
tell
you
surely
curdie
what
you
got
to
do
with
this
suppose
you
mean
mother
answered
curdie
i
must
do
as
the
old
lady
told
me
is
what
i
mean
what
else
could
it
be
am
i
not
right
peter
right
joan
answered
peter
far
as
my
judgement
goes
it
is
a
very
strange
story
but
you
see
the
question
is
not
about
believing
it
for
curdie
knows
what
came
to
him
you
remember
curdie
said
his
mother
when
the
princess
took
you
up
that
tower
once
before
and
there
talked
to
her
you
came
home
quite
angry
with
her
and
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
but
an
old
tub
a
heap
of
straw
oh
i
remember
your
inventory
quite
well
an
old
tub
a
heap
of
straw
a
withered
apple
and
a
sunbeam
according
to
your
eyes
that
was
all
there
was
in
the
great
old
musty
garret
but
now
you
have
had
a
glimpse
of
the
old
princess
herself
mother
i
did
see
her
or
if
i
did
said
curdie
very
thoughtfully
then
began
again
hardest
thing
to
believe
though
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
was
when
the
thin
filmy
creature
that
seemed
almost
to
float
about
in
the
moonlight
like
a
bit
of
the
silver
paper
they
put
over
pictures
or
like
a
handkerchief
made
of
spider
threads
took
my
hand
and
rose
up
she
was
taller
and
stronger
than
you
mother
ever
so
much
at
least
she
looked
so
most
certainly
was
so
curdie
if
she
looked
so
said
mrs
peterson
i
confess
returned
her
son
one
thing
if
there
were
no
other
would
make
me
doubt
whether
i
was
not
dreaming
after
all
wide
awake
though
i
fancied
myself
to
be
course
answered
his
mother
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
you
were
dreaming
or
not
if
you
are
doubtful
of
it
yourself
but
it
make
me
think
i
am
dreaming
when
in
the
summer
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
bunch
of
sweet
peas
that
make
my
heart
glad
with
their
colour
and
scent
and
remember
the
dry
little
thing
i
dibbled
into
the
hole
in
the
same
spot
in
the
spring
i
only
think
how
wonderful
and
lovely
it
all
is
it
seems
just
as
full
of
reason
as
it
is
of
wonder
how
it
is
done
i
ca
tell
only
there
it
is
and
there
is
this
in
it
too
curdie
of
which
you
would
not
be
so
ready
to
think
that
when
you
come
home
to
your
father
and
mother
and
they
find
you
behaving
more
like
a
dear
good
son
than
you
have
behaved
for
a
long
time
they
at
least
are
not
likely
to
think
you
were
only
dreaming
said
curdie
looking
a
little
ashamed
might
have
dreamed
my
duty
dream
often
my
son
for
there
must
then
be
more
truth
in
your
dreams
than
in
your
waking
thoughts
but
however
any
of
these
things
may
be
this
one
point
remains
certain
there
can
be
no
harm
in
doing
as
she
told
you
and
indeed
until
you
are
sure
there
is
no
such
person
you
are
bound
to
do
it
for
you
promised
seems
to
me
said
his
father
if
a
lady
comes
to
you
in
a
dream
curdie
and
tells
you
not
to
talk
about
her
when
you
wake
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
hold
your
tongue
father
yes
mother
i
do
it
said
curdie
then
they
went
to
bed
and
sleep
which
is
the
night
of
the
soul
next
took
them
in
its
arms
and
made
them
well
chapter
the
miners
it
much
increased
curdie
feeling
of
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
affair
that
the
next
morning
when
they
were
at
work
in
the
mine
the
party
of
which
he
and
his
father
were
two
just
as
if
they
had
known
what
had
happened
to
him
the
night
before
began
talking
about
all
manner
of
wonderful
tales
that
were
abroad
in
the
country
chiefly
of
course
those
connected
with
the
mines
and
the
mountains
in
which
they
lay
their
wives
and
mothers
and
grandmothers
were
their
chief
authorities
for
when
they
sat
by
their
firesides
they
heard
their
wives
telling
their
children
the
selfsame
tales
with
little
differences
and
here
and
there
one
they
had
not
heard
before
which
they
had
heard
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
tell
in
one
or
other
of
the
same
cottages
at
length
they
came
to
speak
of
a
certain
strange
being
they
called
old
mother
wotherwop
some
said
their
wives
had
seen
her
it
appeared
as
they
talked
that
not
one
had
seen
her
more
than
once
some
of
their
mothers
and
grandmothers
however
had
seen
her
also
and
they
all
had
told
them
tales
about
her
when
they
were
children
they
said
she
could
take
any
shape
she
liked
but
that
in
reality
she
was
a
withered
old
woman
so
old
and
so
withered
that
she
was
as
thin
as
a
sieve
with
a
lamp
behind
it
that
she
was
never
seen
except
at
night
and
when
something
terrible
had
taken
place
or
was
going
to
take
place
such
as
the
falling
in
of
the
roof
of
a
mine
or
the
breaking
out
of
water
in
it
she
had
more
than
once
been
seen
it
was
always
at
night
beside
some
well
sitting
on
the
brink
of
it
and
leaning
over
and
stirring
it
with
her
forefinger
which
was
six
times
as
long
as
any
of
the
rest
and
whoever
for
months
after
drank
of
that
well
was
sure
to
be
to
this
one
of
them
however
added
that
he
remembered
his
mother
saying
that
whoever
in
bad
health
drank
of
the
well
was
sure
to
get
better
but
the
majority
agreed
that
the
former
was
the
right
version
of
the
story
for
was
she
not
a
witch
an
old
hating
witch
whose
delight
was
to
do
mischief
one
said
he
had
heard
that
she
took
the
shape
of
a
young
woman
sometimes
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
then
was
most
dangerous
of
all
for
she
struck
every
man
who
looked
upon
her
peter
ventured
the
question
whether
she
might
not
as
likely
be
an
angel
that
took
the
form
of
an
old
woman
as
an
old
woman
that
took
the
form
of
an
angel
but
nobody
except
curdie
who
was
holding
his
peace
with
all
his
might
saw
any
sense
in
the
question
they
said
an
old
woman
might
be
very
glad
to
make
herself
look
like
a
young
one
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
young
and
beautiful
one
making
herself
look
old
and
ugly
peter
asked
why
they
were
so
much
more
ready
to
believe
the
bad
that
was
said
of
her
than
the
good
they
answered
because
she
was
bad
he
asked
why
they
believed
her
to
be
bad
and
they
answered
because
she
did
bad
things
when
he
asked
how
they
knew
that
they
said
because
she
was
a
bad
creature
even
if
they
did
know
it
they
said
a
woman
like
that
was
so
much
more
likely
to
be
bad
than
good
why
did
she
go
about
at
night
why
did
she
appear
only
now
and
then
and
on
such
occasions
one
went
on
to
tell
how
one
night
when
his
grandfather
had
been
having
a
jolly
time
of
it
with
his
friends
in
the
market
town
she
had
served
him
so
upon
his
way
home
that
the
poor
man
never
drank
a
drop
of
anything
stronger
than
water
after
it
to
the
day
of
his
death
she
dragged
him
into
a
bog
and
tumbled
him
up
and
down
in
it
till
he
was
nearly
dead
suppose
that
was
her
way
of
teaching
him
what
a
good
thing
water
was
said
peter
but
the
man
who
liked
strong
drink
did
not
see
the
joke
do
say
said
another
she
has
lived
in
the
old
house
over
there
ever
since
the
little
princess
left
it
they
say
too
that
the
housekeeper
knows
all
about
it
and
is
hand
and
glove
with
the
old
witch
i
do
doubt
they
have
many
a
nice
airing
together
on
broomsticks
but
i
do
doubt
either
it
all
nonsense
and
no
such
person
at
all
our
cow
died
said
another
was
seen
going
round
and
round
the
cowhouse
the
same
night
to
be
sure
she
left
a
fine
calf
behind
her
i
mean
the
cow
did
not
the
witch
i
wonder
she
did
kill
that
too
for
she
be
a
far
finer
cow
than
ever
her
mother
was
old
woman
came
upon
her
one
night
not
long
before
the
water
broke
out
in
the
mine
sitting
on
a
stone
on
the
hillside
with
a
whole
congregation
of
cobs
about
her
when
they
saw
my
wife
they
all
scampered
off
as
fast
as
they
could
run
and
where
the
witch
was
sitting
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
withered
bracken
bush
i
made
no
doubt
myself
she
was
putting
them
up
to
it
and
so
they
went
on
with
one
foolish
tale
after
another
while
peter
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
and
curdie
diligently
held
his
peace
but
his
silence
at
last
drew
attention
upon
it
and
one
of
them
said
young
curdie
what
are
you
thinking
of
do
you
know
i
thinking
of
anything
asked
curdie
you
not
saying
anything
it
follow
then
that
as
you
are
saying
so
much
you
not
thinking
at
all
said
curdie
know
what
he
thinking
said
one
who
had
not
yet
spoken
thinking
what
a
set
of
fools
you
are
to
talk
such
rubbish
as
if
ever
there
was
or
could
be
such
an
old
woman
as
you
say
i
sure
curdie
knows
better
than
all
that
comes
to
think
said
curdie
would
be
better
that
he
who
says
anything
about
her
should
be
quite
sure
it
is
true
lest
she
should
hear
him
and
not
like
to
be
slandered
would
she
like
it
any
better
if
it
were
true
said
the
same
man
she
is
what
they
say
i
do
know
but
i
never
knew
a
man
that
would
go
in
a
rage
to
be
called
the
very
thing
he
was
bad
things
were
true
of
her
and
i
knew
it
said
curdie
would
not
hesitate
to
say
them
for
i
will
never
give
in
to
being
afraid
of
anything
that
bad
i
suspect
that
the
things
they
tell
however
if
we
knew
all
about
them
would
turn
out
to
have
nothing
but
good
in
them
and
i
wo
say
a
word
more
for
fear
i
should
say
something
that
might
be
to
her
mind
they
all
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
the
parson
they
cried
believes
in
the
witch
ha
ha
afraid
of
her
says
all
she
does
is
good
wants
to
make
friends
with
her
that
she
may
help
him
to
find
the
silver
me
my
own
eyes
and
a
good
divining
rod
before
all
the
witches
in
the
world
and
so
i
advise
you
too
master
curdie
that
is
when
your
eyes
have
grown
to
be
worth
anything
and
you
have
learned
to
cut
the
hazel
fork
thus
they
all
mocked
and
jeered
at
him
but
he
did
his
best
to
keep
his
temper
and
go
quietly
on
with
his
work
he
got
as
close
to
his
father
as
he
could
however
for
that
helped
him
to
bear
it
as
soon
as
they
were
tired
of
laughing
and
mocking
curdie
was
friendly
with
them
and
long
before
their
midday
meal
all
between
them
was
as
it
had
been
but
when
the
evening
came
peter
and
curdie
felt
that
they
would
rather
walk
home
together
without
other
company
and
therefore
lingered
behind
when
the
rest
of
the
men
left
the
mine
chapter
the
emerald
father
and
son
had
seated
themselves
on
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
at
a
corner
where
three
galleries
met
the
one
they
had
come
along
from
their
work
one
to
the
right
leading
out
of
the
mountain
and
the
other
to
the
left
leading
far
into
a
portion
of
it
which
had
been
long
disused
since
the
inundation
caused
by
the
goblins
it
had
indeed
been
rendered
impassable
by
the
settlement
of
a
quantity
of
the
water
forming
a
small
but
very
deep
lake
in
a
part
where
there
was
a
considerable
descent
they
had
just
risen
and
were
turning
to
the
right
when
a
gleam
caught
their
eyes
and
made
them
look
along
the
whole
gallery
far
up
they
saw
a
pale
green
light
whence
issuing
they
could
not
tell
about
halfway
between
floor
and
roof
of
the
passage
they
saw
nothing
but
the
light
which
was
like
a
large
star
with
a
point
of
darker
colour
yet
brighter
radiance
in
the
heart
of
it
whence
the
rest
of
the
light
shot
out
in
rays
that
faded
toward
the
ends
until
they
vanished
it
shed
hardly
any
light
around
it
although
in
itself
it
was
so
bright
as
to
sting
the
eyes
that
beheld
it
wonderful
stories
had
from
ages
gone
been
current
in
the
mines
about
certain
magic
gems
which
gave
out
light
of
themselves
and
this
light
looked
just
like
what
might
be
supposed
to
shoot
from
the
heart
of
such
a
gem
they
went
up
the
old
gallery
to
find
out
what
it
could
be
to
their
surprise
they
found
however
that
after
going
some
distance
they
were
no
nearer
to
it
so
far
as
they
could
judge
than
when
they
started
it
did
not
seem
to
move
and
yet
they
moving
did
not
approach
it
still
they
persevered
for
it
was
far
too
wonderful
a
thing
to
lose
sight
of
so
long
as
they
could
keep
it
at
length
they
drew
near
the
hollow
where
the
water
lay
and
still
were
no
nearer
the
light
where
they
expected
to
be
stopped
by
the
water
however
water
was
none
something
had
taken
place
in
some
part
of
the
mine
that
had
drained
it
off
and
the
gallery
lay
open
as
in
former
times
and
now
to
their
surprise
the
light
instead
of
being
in
front
of
them
was
shining
at
the
same
distance
to
the
right
where
they
did
not
know
there
was
any
passage
at
all
then
they
discovered
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
they
carried
that
there
the
water
had
broken
through
and
made
an
entrance
to
a
part
of
the
mountain
of
which
peter
knew
nothing
but
they
were
hardly
well
into
it
still
following
the
light
before
curdie
thought
he
recognized
some
of
the
passages
he
had
so
often
gone
through
when
he
was
watching
the
goblins
after
they
had
advanced
a
long
way
with
many
turnings
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
all
at
once
their
eyes
seemed
to
come
suddenly
to
themselves
and
they
became
aware
that
the
light
which
they
had
taken
to
be
a
great
way
from
them
was
in
reality
almost
within
reach
of
their
hands
the
same
instant
it
began
to
grow
larger
and
thinner
the
point
of
light
grew
dim
as
it
spread
the
greenness
melted
away
and
in
a
moment
or
two
instead
of
the
star
a
dark
dark
and
yet
luminous
face
was
looking
at
them
with
living
eyes
and
curdie
felt
a
great
awe
swell
up
in
his
heart
for
he
thought
he
had
seen
those
eyes
before
see
you
know
me
curdie
said
a
voice
your
eyes
are
you
then
i
know
you
said
curdie
i
never
saw
your
face
before
you
have
seen
it
curdie
said
the
voice
and
with
that
the
darkness
of
its
complexion
melted
away
and
down
from
the
face
dawned
out
the
form
that
belonged
to
it
until
at
last
curdie
and
his
father
beheld
a
lady
beautiful
exceedingly
dressed
in
something
pale
green
like
velvet
over
which
her
hair
fell
in
cataracts
of
a
rich
golden
colour
it
looked
as
if
it
were
pouring
down
from
her
head
and
like
the
water
of
the
dustbrook
vanishing
in
a
golden
vapour
ere
it
reached
the
floor
it
came
flowing
from
under
the
edge
of
a
coronet
of
gold
set
with
alternated
pearls
and
emeralds
in
front
of
the
crown
was
a
great
emerald
which
looked
somehow
as
if
out
of
it
had
come
the
light
they
had
followed
there
was
no
ornament
else
about
her
except
on
her
slippers
which
were
one
mass
of
gleaming
emeralds
of
various
shades
of
green
all
mingling
lovelily
like
the
waving
of
grass
in
the
wind
and
sun
she
looked
about
years
old
and
for
all
the
difference
curdie
knew
somehow
or
other
he
could
not
have
told
how
that
the
face
before
him
was
that
of
the
old
princess
by
this
time
all
around
them
had
grown
light
and
now
first
they
could
see
where
they
were
they
stood
in
a
great
splendid
cavern
which
curdie
recognized
as
that
in
which
the
goblins
held
their
state
assemblies
but
strange
to
tell
the
light
by
which
they
saw
came
streaming
sparkling
and
shooting
from
stones
of
many
colours
in
the
sides
and
roof
and
floor
of
the
cavern
stones
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
many
more
it
was
a
glorious
sight
the
whole
rugged
place
flashing
with
colours
in
one
spot
a
great
light
of
deep
carbuncular
red
in
another
of
sapphirine
blue
in
another
of
topaz
yellow
while
here
and
there
were
groups
of
stones
of
all
hues
and
sizes
and
again
nebulous
spaces
of
thousands
of
tiniest
spots
of
brilliancy
of
every
conceivable
shade
sometimes
the
colours
ran
together
and
made
a
little
river
or
lake
of
lambent
interfusing
and
changing
tints
which
by
their
variegation
seemed
to
imitate
the
flowing
of
water
or
waves
made
by
the
wind
curdie
would
have
gazed
entranced
but
that
all
the
beauty
of
the
cavern
yes
of
all
he
knew
of
the
whole
creation
seemed
gathered
in
one
centre
of
harmony
and
loveliness
in
the
person
of
the
ancient
lady
who
stood
before
him
in
the
very
summer
of
beauty
and
strength
turning
from
the
first
glance
at
the
circuadjacent
splendour
it
dwindled
into
nothing
as
he
looked
again
at
the
lady
nothing
flashed
or
glowed
or
shone
about
her
and
yet
it
was
with
a
prevision
of
the
truth
that
he
said
was
here
once
before
know
that
curdie
she
replied
place
was
full
of
torches
and
the
walls
gleamed
but
nothing
as
they
do
now
and
there
is
no
light
in
the
place
want
to
know
where
the
light
comes
from
she
said
smiling
see
i
will
go
out
of
the
cavern
do
not
be
afraid
but
watch
she
went
slowly
out
the
moment
she
turned
her
back
to
go
the
light
began
to
pale
and
fade
the
moment
she
was
out
of
their
sight
the
place
was
black
as
night
save
that
now
the
smoky
of
their
lamps
which
they
thought
had
gone
out
long
ago
cast
a
dusky
glimmer
around
them
chapter
what
is
in
a
name
for
a
time
that
seemed
to
them
long
the
two
men
stood
waiting
while
still
the
mother
of
light
did
not
return
so
long
was
she
absent
that
they
began
to
grow
anxious
how
were
they
to
find
their
way
from
the
natural
hollows
of
the
mountain
crossed
by
goblin
paths
if
their
lamps
should
go
out
to
spend
the
night
there
would
mean
to
sit
and
wait
until
an
earthquake
rent
the
mountain
or
the
earth
herself
fell
back
into
the
smelting
furnace
of
the
sun
whence
she
had
issued
for
it
was
all
night
and
no
faintest
dawn
in
the
bosom
of
the
world
so
long
did
they
wait
unrevisited
that
had
there
not
been
two
of
them
either
would
at
length
have
concluded
the
vision
a
product
of
his
own
seething
brain
and
their
lamps
were
going
out
for
they
grew
redder
and
smokier
but
they
did
not
lose
courage
for
there
is
a
kind
of
capillary
attraction
in
the
facing
of
two
souls
that
lifts
faith
quite
beyond
the
level
to
which
either
could
raise
it
alone
they
knew
that
they
had
seen
the
lady
of
emeralds
and
it
was
to
give
them
their
own
desire
that
she
had
gone
from
them
and
neither
would
yield
for
a
moment
to
the
half
doubts
and
half
dreads
that
awoke
in
his
heart
and
still
she
who
with
her
absence
darkened
their
air
did
not
return
they
grew
weary
and
sat
down
on
the
rocky
floor
for
wait
they
would
indeed
wait
they
must
each
set
his
lamp
by
his
knee
and
watched
it
die
slowly
it
sank
dulled
looked
lazy
and
stupid
but
ever
as
it
sank
and
dulled
the
image
in
his
mind
of
the
lady
of
light
grew
stronger
and
clearer
together
the
two
lamps
panted
and
shuddered
first
one
then
the
other
went
out
leaving
for
a
moment
a
great
red
snuff
then
all
was
the
blackness
of
darkness
up
to
their
very
hearts
and
everywhere
around
them
was
it
no
far
away
it
looked
miles
away
shone
one
minute
faint
point
of
green
light
where
who
could
tell
they
only
knew
that
it
shone
it
grew
larger
and
seemed
to
draw
nearer
until
at
last
as
they
watched
with
speechless
delight
and
expectation
it
seemed
once
more
within
reach
of
an
outstretched
hand
then
it
spread
and
melted
away
as
before
and
there
were
eyes
and
a
face
and
a
lovely
form
and
lo
the
whole
cavern
blazing
with
lights
innumerable
and
gorgeous
yet
soft
and
interfused
so
blended
indeed
that
the
eye
had
to
search
and
see
in
order
to
separate
distinct
spots
of
special
colour
the
moment
they
saw
the
speck
in
the
vast
distance
they
had
risen
and
stood
on
their
feet
when
it
came
nearer
they
bowed
their
heads
yet
now
they
looked
with
fearless
eyes
for
the
woman
that
was
old
yet
young
was
a
joy
to
see
and
filled
their
hearts
with
reverent
delight
she
turned
first
to
peter
have
known
you
long
she
said
have
met
you
going
to
and
from
the
mine
and
seen
you
working
in
it
for
the
last
forty
years
should
it
be
madam
that
a
grand
lady
like
you
should
take
notice
of
a
poor
man
like
me
said
peter
humbly
but
more
foolishly
than
he
could
then
have
understood
am
poor
as
well
as
rich
said
she
too
work
for
my
bread
and
i
show
myself
no
favour
when
i
pay
myself
my
own
wages
last
night
when
you
sat
by
the
brook
and
curdie
told
you
about
my
pigeon
and
my
spinning
and
wondered
whether
he
could
believe
that
he
had
actually
seen
me
i
heard
what
you
said
to
each
other
i
am
always
about
as
the
miners
said
the
other
night
when
they
talked
of
me
as
old
mother
wotherwop
the
lovely
lady
laughed
and
her
laugh
was
a
lightning
of
delight
in
their
souls
she
went
on
have
got
to
thank
me
that
you
are
so
poor
peter
i
have
seen
to
that
and
it
has
done
well
for
both
you
and
me
my
friend
things
come
to
the
poor
that
ca
get
in
at
the
door
of
the
rich
their
money
somehow
blocks
it
up
it
is
a
great
privilege
to
be
poor
peter
one
that
no
man
ever
coveted
and
but
a
very
few
have
sought
to
retain
but
one
that
yet
many
have
learned
to
prize
you
must
not
mistake
however
and
imagine
it
a
virtue
it
is
but
a
privilege
and
one
also
that
like
other
privileges
may
be
terribly
misused
had
you
been
rich
my
peter
you
would
not
have
been
so
good
as
some
rich
men
i
know
and
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
no
one
knows
but
myself
you
peter
and
your
wife
both
have
the
blood
of
the
royal
family
in
your
veins
i
have
been
trying
to
cultivate
your
family
tree
every
branch
of
which
is
known
to
me
and
i
expect
curdie
to
turn
out
a
blossom
on
it
therefore
i
have
been
training
him
for
a
work
that
must
soon
be
done
i
was
near
losing
him
and
had
to
send
my
pigeon
had
he
not
shot
it
that
would
have
been
better
but
he
repented
and
that
shall
be
as
good
in
the
end
she
turned
to
curdie
and
smiled
said
curdie
i
ask
questions
not
curdie
i
have
been
told
that
nobody
must
ask
the
king
questions
king
never
made
that
law
she
answered
with
some
displeasure
may
ask
me
as
many
as
you
please
that
is
so
long
as
they
are
sensible
only
i
may
take
a
few
thousand
years
to
answer
some
of
them
but
that
nothing
of
all
things
time
is
the
cheapest
would
you
mind
telling
me
now
for
i
feel
very
confused
about
it
are
you
the
lady
of
the
silver
moon
curdie
you
may
call
me
that
if
you
like
what
it
means
is
true
now
i
see
you
dark
and
clothed
in
green
and
the
mother
of
all
the
light
that
dwells
in
the
stones
of
the
earth
and
up
there
they
call
you
old
mother
wotherwop
and
the
princess
irene
told
me
you
were
her
and
you
spin
the
spider
threads
and
take
care
of
a
whole
people
of
pigeons
and
you
are
worn
to
a
pale
shadow
with
old
age
and
are
as
young
as
anybody
can
be
not
to
be
too
young
and
as
strong
i
do
believe
as
i
am
the
lady
stooped
toward
a
large
green
stone
bedded
in
the
rock
of
the
floor
and
looking
like
a
well
of
grassy
light
in
it
she
laid
hold
of
it
with
her
fingers
broke
it
out
and
gave
it
to
peter
cried
curdie
told
you
so
twenty
men
could
not
have
done
that
and
your
fingers
are
white
and
smooth
as
any
lady
in
the
land
i
know
what
to
make
of
it
could
give
you
twenty
names
more
to
call
me
curdie
and
not
one
of
them
would
be
a
false
one
what
does
it
matter
how
many
names
if
the
person
is
one
but
it
is
not
names
only
look
at
what
you
were
like
last
night
and
what
i
see
you
now
are
only
dresses
curdie
and
dresses
are
only
names
that
which
is
inside
is
the
same
all
the
time
then
how
can
all
the
shapes
speak
the
truth
would
want
thousands
more
to
speak
the
truth
curdie
and
then
they
could
not
but
there
is
a
point
i
must
not
let
you
mistake
about
it
is
one
thing
the
shape
i
choose
to
put
on
and
quite
another
the
shape
that
foolish
talk
and
nursery
tale
may
please
to
put
upon
me
also
it
is
one
thing
what
you
or
your
father
may
think
about
me
and
quite
another
what
a
foolish
or
bad
man
may
see
in
me
for
instance
if
a
thief
were
to
come
in
here
just
now
he
would
think
he
saw
the
demon
of
the
mine
all
in
green
flames
come
to
protect
her
treasure
and
would
run
like
a
hunted
wild
goat
i
should
be
all
the
same
but
his
evil
eyes
would
see
me
as
i
was
not
think
i
understand
said
curdie
said
the
lady
turning
then
to
him
will
have
to
give
up
curdie
for
a
little
while
long
as
he
loves
us
that
will
not
matter
much
you
are
right
there
my
friend
said
the
beautiful
princess
and
as
she
said
it
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
the
hard
horny
hand
of
the
miner
in
it
and
held
it
for
a
moment
lovingly
need
say
no
more
she
added
we
understand
each
other
you
and
i
peter
the
tears
came
into
peter
eyes
he
bowed
his
head
in
thankfulness
and
his
heart
was
much
too
full
to
speak
then
the
great
old
young
beautiful
princess
turned
to
curdie
curdie
are
you
ready
she
said
answered
curdie
do
not
know
what
for
do
that
is
enough
could
not
have
given
me
a
better
answer
or
done
more
to
prepare
yourself
curdie
she
returned
with
one
of
her
radiant
smiles
you
think
you
will
know
me
again
think
so
but
how
can
i
tell
what
you
may
look
like
next
that
indeed
how
can
you
tell
or
how
could
i
expect
you
should
but
those
who
know
me
well
know
me
whatever
new
dress
or
shape
or
name
i
may
be
in
and
by
and
by
you
will
have
learned
to
do
so
too
if
you
want
me
to
know
you
again
for
certain
sure
said
curdie
you
not
give
me
some
sign
or
tell
me
something
about
you
that
never
changes
or
some
other
way
to
know
you
or
thing
to
know
you
by
curdie
that
would
be
to
keep
you
from
knowing
me
you
must
know
me
in
quite
another
way
from
that
it
would
not
be
the
least
use
to
you
or
me
either
if
i
were
to
make
you
know
me
in
that
way
it
would
be
but
to
know
the
sign
of
me
not
to
know
me
myself
it
would
be
no
better
than
if
i
were
to
take
this
emerald
out
of
my
crown
and
give
it
to
you
to
take
home
with
you
and
you
were
to
call
it
me
and
talk
to
it
as
if
it
heard
and
saw
and
loved
you
much
good
that
would
do
you
curdie
no
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
know
me
and
if
you
do
you
will
you
shall
see
me
again
in
very
different
circumstances
from
these
and
i
will
tell
you
so
much
it
may
be
in
a
very
different
shape
but
come
now
i
will
lead
you
out
of
this
cavern
my
good
joan
will
be
getting
too
anxious
about
you
one
word
more
you
will
allow
that
the
men
knew
little
what
they
were
talking
about
this
morning
when
they
told
all
those
tales
of
old
mother
wotherwop
but
did
it
occur
to
you
to
think
how
it
was
they
fell
to
talking
about
me
at
all
it
was
because
i
came
to
them
i
was
beside
them
all
the
time
they
were
talking
about
me
though
they
were
far
enough
from
knowing
it
and
had
very
little
besides
foolishness
to
say
as
she
spoke
she
turned
and
led
the
way
from
the
cavern
which
as
if
a
door
had
been
closed
sank
into
absolute
blackness
behind
them
and
now
they
saw
nothing
more
of
the
lady
except
the
green
star
which
again
seemed
a
good
distance
in
front
of
them
and
to
which
they
came
no
nearer
although
following
it
at
a
quick
pace
through
the
mountain
such
was
their
confidence
in
her
guidance
however
and
so
fearless
were
they
in
consequence
that
they
felt
their
way
neither
with
hand
nor
foot
but
walked
straight
on
through
the
galleries
when
at
length
the
night
of
the
upper
world
looked
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
mine
the
green
light
seemed
to
lose
its
way
among
the
stars
and
they
saw
it
no
more
out
they
came
into
the
cool
blessed
night
it
was
very
late
and
only
starlight
to
their
surprise
three
paces
away
they
saw
seated
upon
a
stone
an
old
in
a
cloak
which
they
took
for
black
when
they
came
close
up
to
it
they
saw
it
was
red
evening
said
peter
evening
returned
the
old
woman
in
a
voice
as
old
as
herself
but
curdie
took
off
his
cap
and
said
am
your
servant
princess
the
old
woman
replied
to
me
in
the
dove
tower
tomorrow
night
curdie
alone
will
said
curdie
so
they
parted
and
father
and
son
went
home
to
wife
and
mother
two
persons
in
one
rich
happy
woman

mission
the
next
night
curdie
went
home
from
the
mine
a
little
earlier
than
usual
to
make
himself
tidy
before
going
to
the
dove
tower
the
princess
had
not
appointed
an
exact
time
for
him
to
be
there
he
would
go
as
near
the
time
he
had
gone
first
as
he
could
on
his
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
met
his
father
coming
up
the
sun
was
then
down
and
the
warm
first
of
the
twilight
filled
the
evening
he
came
rather
wearily
up
the
hill
the
road
he
thought
must
have
grown
steeper
in
parts
since
he
was
curdie
age
his
back
was
to
the
light
of
the
sunset
which
closed
him
all
round
in
a
beautiful
setting
and
curdie
thought
what
a
man
his
father
was
even
when
he
was
tired
it
is
greed
and
laziness
and
selfishness
not
hunger
or
weariness
or
cold
that
take
the
dignity
out
of
a
man
and
make
him
look
mean
curdie
there
you
are
he
said
seeing
his
son
come
bounding
along
as
if
it
were
morning
with
him
and
not
evening
look
tired
father
said
curdie
my
boy
i
not
so
young
as
you
so
old
as
the
princess
said
curdie
me
this
said
peter
do
people
talk
about
going
downhill
when
they
begin
to
get
old
it
seems
to
me
that
then
first
they
begin
to
go
uphill
looked
to
me
father
when
i
caught
sight
of
you
as
if
you
had
been
climbing
the
hill
all
your
life
and
were
soon
to
get
to
the
top
can
tell
when
that
will
be
returned
peter
so
ready
to
think
we
just
at
the
top
when
it
lies
miles
away
but
i
must
not
keep
you
my
boy
for
you
are
wanted
and
we
shall
be
anxious
to
know
what
the
princess
says
to
you
that
is
if
she
will
allow
you
to
tell
us
think
she
will
for
she
knows
there
is
nobody
more
to
be
trusted
than
my
father
and
mother
said
curdie
with
pride
and
away
he
shot
and
ran
and
jumped
and
seemed
almost
to
fly
down
the
long
winding
steep
path
until
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
house
there
he
met
an
unexpected
obstruction
in
the
open
door
stood
the
housekeeper
and
she
seemed
to
broaden
herself
out
until
she
almost
filled
the
doorway
she
said
you
is
it
young
man
you
are
the
person
that
comes
in
and
goes
out
when
he
pleases
and
keeps
running
up
and
down
my
stairs
without
ever
saying
by
your
leave
or
even
wiping
his
shoes
and
always
leaves
the
door
open
do
you
know
this
is
my
house
i
do
not
returned
curdie
respectfully
forget
that
it
is
the
king
house
is
all
the
same
the
king
left
it
to
me
to
take
care
of
and
that
you
shall
know
the
king
dead
that
he
has
left
it
to
you
asked
curdie
half
in
doubt
from
the
of
the
woman
fellow
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
you
see
by
my
dress
that
i
am
in
the
king
service
am
i
not
one
of
his
miners
that
goes
for
nothing
i
am
one
of
his
household
you
are
an
labourer
you
are
a
nobody
you
carry
a
pickaxe
i
carry
the
keys
at
my
girdle
see
you
must
not
call
one
a
nobody
to
whom
the
king
has
spoken
said
curdie
along
with
you
cried
the
housekeeper
and
would
have
shut
the
door
in
his
face
had
she
not
been
afraid
that
when
she
stepped
back
he
would
step
in
ere
she
could
get
it
in
motion
for
it
was
very
heavy
and
always
seemed
unwilling
to
shut
curdie
came
a
pace
nearer
she
lifted
the
great
house
key
from
her
side
and
threatened
to
strike
him
down
with
it
calling
aloud
on
mar
and
whelk
and
plout
the
menservants
under
her
to
come
and
help
her
ere
one
of
them
could
answer
however
she
gave
a
great
shriek
and
turned
and
fled
leaving
the
door
wide
open
curdie
looked
behind
him
and
saw
an
animal
whose
gruesome
oddity
even
he
who
knew
so
many
of
the
strange
creatures
two
of
which
were
never
the
same
that
used
to
live
inside
the
mountain
with
their
masters
the
goblins
had
never
seen
equalled
its
eyes
were
flaming
with
anger
but
it
seemed
to
be
at
the
housekeeper
for
it
came
cowering
and
creeping
up
and
laid
its
head
on
the
ground
at
curdie
feet
curdie
hardly
waited
to
look
at
it
however
but
ran
into
the
house
eager
to
get
up
the
stairs
before
any
of
the
men
should
come
to
annoy
he
had
no
fear
of
their
preventing
him
without
halt
or
hindrance
though
the
passages
were
nearly
dark
he
reached
the
door
of
the
workroom
and
knocked
in
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
curdie
opened
the
door
but
to
his
astonishment
saw
no
room
there
could
he
have
opened
a
wrong
door
there
was
the
great
sky
and
the
stars
and
beneath
he
could
see
nothing
only
darkness
but
what
was
that
in
the
sky
straight
in
front
of
him
a
great
wheel
of
fire
turning
and
turning
and
flashing
out
blue
lights
in
curdie
said
the
voice
again
would
at
once
said
curdie
i
were
sure
i
was
standing
at
your
door
should
you
doubt
it
curdie
i
see
neither
walls
nor
floor
only
darkness
and
the
great
sky
is
all
right
curdie
come
in
curdie
stepped
forward
at
once
he
was
indeed
for
the
very
crumb
of
a
moment
tempted
to
feel
before
him
with
his
foot
but
he
saw
that
would
be
to
distrust
the
princess
and
a
greater
rudeness
he
could
not
offer
her
so
he
stepped
straight
in
i
will
not
say
without
a
little
tremble
at
the
thought
of
finding
no
floor
beneath
his
foot
but
that
which
had
need
of
the
floor
found
it
and
his
foot
was
satisfied
no
sooner
was
he
in
than
he
saw
that
the
great
revolving
wheel
in
the
sky
was
the
princess
spinning
wheel
near
the
other
end
of
the
room
turning
very
fast
he
could
see
no
sky
or
stars
any
more
but
the
wheel
was
flashing
out
blue
oh
such
lovely
light
and
behind
it
of
course
sat
the
princess
but
whether
an
old
woman
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
leaf
or
a
glorious
lady
as
young
as
perfection
he
could
not
tell
for
the
turning
and
flashing
of
the
wheel
to
the
wheel
said
the
voice
which
had
already
grown
dear
to
curdie
its
very
tone
was
precious
like
a
jewel
not
as
a
jewel
for
no
jewel
could
compare
with
it
in
preciousness
and
curdie
listened
and
listened
is
it
saying
asked
the
voice
is
singing
answered
curdie
is
it
singing
curdie
tried
to
make
out
but
thought
he
could
not
for
no
sooner
had
he
got
hold
of
something
than
it
vanished
again
yet
he
listened
and
listened
entranced
with
delight
you
curdie
said
the
voice
said
curdie
did
try
hard
for
a
while
but
i
could
not
make
anything
of
it
yes
you
did
and
you
have
been
telling
it
to
me
shall
i
tell
you
again
what
i
told
my
wheel
and
my
wheel
told
you
and
you
have
just
told
me
without
knowing
it
then
the
lady
began
to
sing
and
her
wheel
spun
an
accompaniment
to
her
song
and
the
music
of
the
wheel
was
like
the
music
of
an
aeolian
harp
blown
upon
by
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
oh
the
sweet
sounds
of
that
spinning
wheel
now
they
were
gold
now
silver
now
grass
now
palm
trees
now
ancient
cities
now
rubies
now
mountain
brooks
now
peacock
feathers
now
clouds
now
snowdrops
and
now
islands
but
for
the
voice
that
sang
through
it
all
about
that
i
have
no
words
to
tell
it
would
make
you
weep
if
i
were
able
to
tell
you
what
that
was
like
it
was
so
beautiful
and
true
and
lovely
but
this
is
something
like
the
words
of
its
song
the
stars
are
spinning
their
threads
and
the
clouds
are
the
dust
that
flies
and
the
suns
are
weaving
them
up
for
the
time
when
the
sleepers
shall
rise
the
ocean
in
music
rolls
and
gems
are
turning
to
eyes
and
the
trees
are
gathering
souls
for
the
day
when
the
sleepers
shall
rise
the
weepers
are
learning
to
smile
and
laughter
to
glean
the
sighs
burn
and
bury
the
care
and
guile
for
the
day
when
the
sleepers
shall
rise
oh
the
dews
and
the
moths
and
the
daisy
red
the
larks
and
the
glimmers
and
flows
the
lilies
and
sparrows
and
daily
bread
and
the
something
that
nobody
knows
the
princess
stopped
her
wheel
stopped
and
she
laughed
and
her
laugh
was
sweeter
than
song
and
wheel
sweeter
than
running
brook
and
silver
bell
sweeter
than
joy
itself
for
the
heart
of
the
laugh
was
love
now
curdie
to
this
side
of
my
wheel
and
you
will
find
me
she
said
and
her
laugh
seemed
sounding
on
still
in
the
words
as
if
they
were
made
of
breath
that
had
laughed
curdie
obeyed
and
passed
the
wheel
and
there
she
stood
to
receive
him
fairer
than
when
he
saw
her
last
a
little
younger
still
and
dressed
not
in
green
and
emeralds
but
in
pale
blue
with
a
coronet
of
silver
set
with
pearls
and
slippers
covered
with
opals
that
gleamed
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
it
was
some
time
before
curdie
could
take
his
eyes
from
the
marvel
of
her
loveliness
fearing
at
last
that
he
was
rude
he
turned
them
away
and
behold
he
was
in
a
room
that
was
for
beauty
marvellous
the
lofty
ceiling
was
all
a
golden
vine
whose
great
clusters
of
carbuncles
rubies
and
chrysoberyls
hung
down
like
the
bosses
of
groined
arches
and
in
its
centre
hung
the
most
glorious
lamp
that
human
eyes
ever
saw
the
silver
moon
itself
a
globe
of
silver
as
it
seemed
with
a
heart
of
light
so
wondrous
potent
that
it
rendered
the
mass
translucent
and
altogether
radiant
the
room
was
so
large
that
looking
back
he
could
scarcely
see
the
end
at
which
he
entered
but
the
other
was
only
a
few
yards
from
him
and
there
he
saw
another
wonder
on
a
huge
hearth
a
great
fire
was
burning
and
the
fire
was
a
huge
heap
of
roses
and
yet
it
was
fire
the
smell
of
the
roses
filled
the
air
and
the
heat
of
the
flames
of
them
glowed
upon
his
face
he
turned
an
inquiring
look
upon
the
lady
and
saw
that
she
was
now
seated
in
an
ancient
chair
the
legs
of
which
were
crusted
with
gems
but
the
upper
part
like
a
nest
of
daisies
and
moss
and
green
grass
she
said
in
answer
to
his
eyes
have
stood
more
than
one
trial
already
and
have
stood
them
well
now
i
am
going
to
put
you
to
a
harder
do
you
think
you
are
prepared
for
it
can
i
tell
he
returned
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
or
what
preparation
it
needs
judge
me
yourself
needs
only
trust
and
obedience
answered
the
lady
dare
not
say
anything
if
you
think
me
fit
command
me
will
hurt
you
terribly
curdie
but
that
will
be
all
no
real
hurt
but
much
good
will
come
to
you
from
it
curdie
made
no
answer
but
stood
gazing
with
parted
lips
in
the
face
and
thrust
both
your
hands
into
that
fire
she
said
quickly
almost
hurriedly
curdie
dared
not
stop
to
think
it
was
much
too
terrible
to
think
about
he
rushed
to
the
fire
and
thrust
both
of
his
hands
right
into
the
middle
of
the
heap
of
flaming
roses
and
his
arms
halfway
up
to
the
elbows
and
it
did
hurt
but
he
did
not
draw
them
back
he
held
the
pain
as
if
it
were
a
thing
that
would
kill
him
if
he
let
it
go
as
indeed
it
would
have
done
he
was
in
terrible
fear
lest
it
should
conquer
him
but
when
it
had
risen
to
the
pitch
that
he
thought
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
it
began
to
fall
again
and
went
on
growing
less
and
less
until
by
contrast
with
its
former
severity
it
had
become
rather
pleasant
at
last
it
ceased
altogether
and
curdie
thought
his
hands
must
be
burned
to
cinders
if
not
ashes
for
he
did
not
feel
them
at
all
the
princess
told
him
to
take
them
out
and
look
at
them
he
did
so
and
found
that
all
that
was
gone
of
them
was
the
rough
hard
skin
they
were
white
and
smooth
like
the
princess
to
me
she
said
he
obeyed
and
saw
to
his
surprise
that
her
face
looked
as
if
she
had
been
weeping
princess
what
is
the
matter
he
cried
i
make
a
noise
and
vex
you
curdie
she
answered
it
was
very
bad
you
feel
it
too
then
course
i
did
but
now
it
is
over
and
all
is
well
would
you
like
to
know
why
i
made
you
put
your
hands
in
the
fire
curdie
looked
at
them
again
then
said
take
the
marks
of
the
work
off
them
and
make
them
fit
for
the
king
court
i
suppose
curdie
answered
the
princess
shaking
her
head
for
she
was
not
pleased
with
the
answer
would
be
a
poor
way
of
making
your
hands
fit
for
the
king
court
to
take
off
them
signs
of
his
service
there
is
a
far
greater
difference
on
them
than
that
do
you
feel
none
will
though
by
and
by
when
the
time
comes
but
perhaps
even
then
you
might
not
know
what
had
been
given
you
therefore
i
will
tell
you
have
you
ever
heard
what
some
philosophers
say
that
men
were
all
animals
once
is
of
no
consequence
but
there
is
another
thing
that
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
this
that
all
men
if
they
do
not
take
care
go
down
the
hill
to
the
animals
country
that
many
men
are
actually
all
their
lives
going
to
be
beasts
people
knew
it
once
but
it
is
long
since
they
forgot
it
am
not
surprised
to
hear
it
when
i
think
of
some
of
our
miners
but
you
must
beware
curdie
how
you
say
of
this
man
or
that
man
that
he
is
travelling
beastward
there
are
not
nearly
so
many
going
that
way
as
at
first
sight
you
might
think
when
you
met
your
father
on
the
hill
tonight
you
stood
and
spoke
together
on
the
same
spot
and
although
one
of
you
was
going
up
and
the
other
coming
down
at
a
little
distance
no
one
could
have
told
which
was
bound
in
the
one
direction
and
which
in
the
other
just
so
two
people
may
be
at
the
same
spot
in
manners
and
behaviour
and
yet
one
may
be
getting
better
and
the
other
worse
which
is
just
the
greatest
of
all
differences
that
could
possibly
exist
between
them
said
curdie
is
the
good
of
knowing
that
there
is
such
a
difference
if
you
can
never
know
where
it
is
curdie
you
must
mind
exactly
what
words
i
use
because
although
the
right
words
can
not
do
exactly
what
i
want
them
to
do
the
wrong
words
will
certainly
do
what
i
do
not
want
them
to
do
i
did
not
say
you
can
never
know
when
there
is
a
necessity
for
your
knowing
when
you
have
to
do
important
business
with
this
or
that
man
there
is
always
a
way
of
knowing
enough
to
keep
you
from
any
great
blunder
and
as
you
will
have
important
business
to
do
by
and
by
and
that
with
people
of
whom
you
yet
know
nothing
it
will
be
necessary
that
you
should
have
some
better
means
than
usual
of
learning
the
nature
of
them
listen
since
it
is
always
what
they
do
whether
in
their
minds
or
their
bodies
that
makes
men
go
down
to
be
less
than
men
that
is
beasts
the
change
always
comes
first
in
their
hands
and
first
of
all
in
the
inside
hands
to
which
the
outside
ones
are
but
as
the
gloves
they
do
not
know
it
of
course
for
a
beast
does
not
know
that
he
is
a
beast
and
the
nearer
a
man
gets
to
being
a
beast
the
less
he
knows
it
neither
can
their
best
friends
or
their
worst
enemies
indeed
see
any
difference
in
their
hands
for
they
see
only
the
living
gloves
of
them
but
there
are
not
a
few
who
feel
a
vague
something
repulsive
in
the
hand
of
a
man
who
is
growing
a
beast
here
is
what
the
has
done
for
you
it
has
made
your
hands
so
knowing
and
wise
it
has
brought
your
real
hands
so
near
the
outside
of
your
flesh
gloves
that
you
will
henceforth
be
able
to
know
at
once
the
hand
of
a
man
who
is
growing
into
a
beast
nay
more
you
will
at
once
feel
the
foot
of
the
beast
he
is
growing
just
as
if
there
were
no
glove
made
like
a
man
hand
between
you
and
it
of
course
it
follows
that
you
will
be
able
often
and
with
further
education
in
zoology
will
be
able
always
to
tell
not
only
when
a
man
is
growing
a
beast
but
what
beast
he
is
growing
to
for
you
will
know
the
foot
what
it
is
and
what
beast
it
is
according
then
to
your
knowledge
of
that
beast
will
be
your
knowledge
of
the
man
you
have
to
do
with
only
there
is
one
beautiful
and
awful
thing
about
it
that
if
any
one
gifted
with
this
perception
once
uses
it
for
his
own
ends
it
is
taken
from
him
and
then
not
knowing
that
it
is
gone
he
is
in
a
far
worse
condition
than
before
for
he
trusts
to
what
he
has
not
got
dreadful
said
curdie
must
mind
what
i
am
about
indeed
curdie
may
not
one
sometimes
make
a
mistake
without
being
able
to
help
it
but
so
long
as
he
is
not
after
his
own
ends
he
will
never
make
a
serious
mistake
suppose
you
want
me
to
warn
every
one
whose
hand
tells
me
that
he
is
growing
a
beast
because
as
you
say
he
does
not
know
it
himself
the
princess
smiled
good
that
would
do
curdie
i
do
say
there
are
no
cases
in
which
it
would
be
of
use
but
they
are
very
rare
and
peculiar
cases
and
if
such
come
you
will
know
them
to
such
a
person
there
is
in
general
no
insult
like
the
truth
he
can
not
endure
it
not
because
he
is
growing
a
beast
but
because
he
is
ceasing
to
be
a
man
it
is
the
dying
man
in
him
that
it
makes
uncomfortable
and
he
trots
or
creeps
or
swims
or
flutters
out
of
its
way
calls
it
a
foolish
feeling
a
whim
an
old
wives
fable
a
bit
of
priests
humbug
an
effete
superstition
and
so
on
is
there
no
hope
for
him
can
nothing
be
done
it
so
awful
to
think
of
going
down
down
down
like
that
when
it
with
his
own
will
what
seems
to
me
to
make
it
worst
of
all
said
curdie
are
right
answered
the
princess
nodding
her
head
there
is
this
amount
of
excuse
to
make
for
all
such
remember
that
they
do
not
know
what
or
how
horrid
their
coming
fate
is
many
a
lady
so
delicate
and
nice
that
she
can
bear
nothing
coarser
than
the
finest
linen
to
touch
her
body
if
she
had
a
mirror
that
could
show
her
the
animal
she
is
growing
to
as
it
lies
waiting
within
the
fair
skin
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
silk
and
the
jewels
would
receive
a
shock
that
might
possibly
wake
her
up
then
should
she
have
it
the
princess
held
her
peace
here
lina
she
said
after
a
long
pause
from
somewhere
behind
curdie
crept
forward
the
same
hideous
animal
which
had
fawned
at
his
feet
at
the
door
and
which
without
his
knowing
it
had
followed
him
every
step
up
the
dove
tower
she
ran
to
the
princess
and
lay
down
flat
at
her
feet
looking
up
at
her
with
an
expression
so
pitiful
that
in
curdie
heart
it
overcame
all
the
ludicrousness
of
her
horrible
mass
of
incongruities
she
had
a
very
short
body
and
very
long
legs
made
like
an
elephant
so
that
in
lying
down
she
kneeled
with
both
pairs
her
tail
which
dragged
on
the
floor
behind
her
was
twice
as
long
and
quite
as
thick
as
her
body
her
head
was
something
between
that
of
a
polar
bear
and
a
snake
her
eyes
were
dark
green
with
a
yellow
light
in
them
her
under
teeth
came
up
like
a
fringe
of
icicles
only
very
white
outside
of
her
upper
lip
her
throat
looked
as
if
the
hair
had
been
plucked
off
it
showed
a
skin
white
and
smooth
curdie
a
paw
lina
said
the
princess
the
creature
rose
and
lifting
a
long
foreleg
held
up
a
great
doglike
paw
to
curdie
he
took
it
gently
but
what
a
shudder
as
of
terrified
delight
ran
through
him
when
instead
of
the
paw
of
a
dog
such
as
it
seemed
to
his
eyes
he
clasped
in
his
great
mining
fist
the
soft
neat
little
hand
of
a
child
he
took
it
in
both
of
his
and
held
it
as
if
he
could
not
let
it
go
the
green
eyes
stared
at
him
with
their
yellow
light
and
the
mouth
was
turned
up
toward
him
with
its
constant
half
grin
but
here
was
the
child
hand
if
he
could
but
pull
the
child
out
of
the
beast
his
eyes
sought
the
princess
she
was
watching
him
with
evident
satisfaction
here
is
a
child
hand
said
curdie
gift
does
more
for
you
than
it
promised
it
is
yet
better
to
perceive
a
hidden
good
than
a
hidden
evil
began
curdie
am
not
going
to
answer
any
more
questions
this
evening
interrupted
the
princess
have
not
half
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
answers
i
have
already
given
you
that
paw
in
your
hand
now
might
almost
teach
you
the
whole
science
of
natural
history
the
heavenly
sort
i
mean
will
think
said
curdie
oh
please
one
word
more
may
i
tell
my
father
and
mother
all
about
it
though
perhaps
now
it
may
be
their
turn
to
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
believe
that
things
went
just
as
you
must
tell
them
shall
see
that
i
believe
it
all
this
time
said
curdie
them
that
tomorrow
morning
you
must
set
out
for
the
court
not
like
a
great
man
but
just
as
poor
as
you
are
they
had
better
not
speak
about
it
tell
them
also
that
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
they
hear
of
you
again
but
they
must
not
lose
heart
and
tell
your
father
to
lay
that
stone
i
gave
him
at
night
in
a
safe
place
not
because
of
the
greatness
of
its
price
although
it
is
such
an
emerald
as
no
prince
has
in
his
crown
but
because
it
will
be
a
between
you
and
him
as
often
as
he
gets
at
all
anxious
about
you
he
must
take
it
and
lay
it
in
the
fire
and
leave
it
there
when
he
goes
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
must
find
it
in
the
ashes
and
if
it
be
as
green
as
ever
then
all
goes
well
with
you
if
it
have
lost
colour
things
go
ill
with
you
but
if
it
be
very
pale
indeed
then
you
are
in
great
danger
and
he
must
come
to
me
said
curdie
am
i
to
go
now
answered
the
princess
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
curdie
took
it
trembling
with
joy
it
was
a
very
beautiful
hand
not
small
very
smooth
but
not
very
soft
and
just
the
same
to
his
touch
that
it
was
to
his
eyes
he
would
have
stood
there
all
night
holding
it
if
she
had
not
gently
withdrawn
it
will
provide
you
a
servant
she
said
your
journey
and
to
wait
upon
you
afterward
where
am
i
to
go
and
what
am
i
to
do
you
have
given
me
no
message
to
carry
neither
have
you
said
what
i
am
wanted
for
i
go
without
a
notion
whether
i
am
to
walk
this
way
or
that
or
what
i
am
to
do
when
i
get
i
do
know
where
said
the
princess
and
there
was
a
tone
of
reminder
in
his
own
name
as
she
spoke
it
i
not
tell
you
to
tell
your
father
and
mother
that
you
were
to
set
out
for
the
court
and
you
know
that
lies
to
the
north
you
must
learn
to
use
far
less
direct
directions
than
that
you
must
not
be
like
a
dull
servant
that
needs
to
be
told
again
and
again
before
he
will
understand
you
have
orders
enough
to
start
with
and
you
will
find
as
you
go
on
and
as
you
need
to
know
what
you
have
to
do
but
i
warn
you
that
perhaps
it
will
not
look
the
least
like
what
you
may
have
been
fancying
i
should
require
of
you
i
have
one
idea
of
you
and
your
work
and
you
have
another
i
do
not
blame
you
for
that
you
can
not
help
it
yet
but
you
must
be
ready
to
let
my
idea
which
sets
you
working
set
your
idea
right
be
true
and
honest
and
fearless
and
all
shall
go
well
with
you
and
your
work
and
all
with
whom
your
work
lies
and
so
with
your
parents
and
me
too
curdie
she
added
after
a
little
pause
the
young
miner
bowed
his
head
low
patted
the
strange
head
that
lay
at
the
princess
feet
and
turned
away
as
soon
as
he
passed
the
spinning
wheel
which
looked
in
the
midst
of
the
glorious
room
just
like
any
wheel
you
might
find
in
a
country
cottage
old
and
worn
and
dingy
and
dusty
the
splendour
of
the
place
vanished
and
he
saw
but
the
big
bare
room
he
seemed
at
first
to
have
entered
with
the
moon
the
princess
moon
no
doubt
shining
in
at
one
of
the
windows
upon
the
spinning
wheel
chapter
hands
curdie
went
home
pondering
much
and
told
everything
to
his
father
and
mother
as
the
old
princess
had
said
it
was
now
their
turn
to
find
what
they
heard
hard
to
believe
if
they
had
not
been
able
to
trust
curdie
himself
they
would
have
refused
to
believe
more
than
the
half
of
what
he
reported
then
they
would
have
refused
that
half
too
and
at
last
would
most
likely
for
a
time
have
disbelieved
in
the
very
existence
of
the
princess
what
evidence
their
own
senses
had
given
them
notwithstanding
for
he
had
nothing
conclusive
to
show
in
proof
of
what
he
told
them
when
he
held
out
his
hands
to
them
his
mother
said
they
looked
as
if
he
had
been
washing
them
with
soft
soap
only
they
did
smell
of
something
nicer
than
that
and
she
must
allow
it
was
more
like
roses
than
anything
else
she
knew
his
father
could
not
see
any
difference
upon
his
hands
but
then
it
was
night
he
said
and
their
poor
little
lamp
was
not
enough
for
his
old
eyes
as
to
the
feel
of
them
each
of
his
own
hands
he
said
was
hard
and
horny
enough
for
two
and
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
dullness
of
his
own
thick
skin
that
he
felt
no
change
on
curdie
palms
curdie
said
his
mother
my
hand
and
see
what
beast
paw
lies
inside
it
mother
answered
curdie
half
beseeching
half
indignant
will
not
insult
my
new
gift
by
making
pretence
to
try
it
that
would
be
mockery
there
is
no
hand
within
yours
but
the
hand
of
a
true
woman
my
mother
should
like
you
just
to
take
hold
of
my
hand
though
said
his
mother
are
my
son
and
may
know
all
the
bad
there
is
in
me
then
at
once
curdie
took
her
hand
in
his
and
when
he
had
it
he
kept
it
stroking
it
gently
with
his
other
hand
he
said
at
length
hand
feels
just
like
that
of
the
princess
my
horny
cracked
rheumatic
old
hand
with
its
big
joints
and
its
short
nails
all
worn
down
to
the
quick
with
hard
work
like
the
hand
of
the
beautiful
princess
why
my
child
you
will
make
me
fancy
your
fingers
have
grown
very
dull
indeed
instead
of
sharp
and
delicate
if
you
talk
such
nonsense
mine
is
such
an
ugly
hand
i
should
be
ashamed
to
show
it
to
any
but
one
that
loved
me
but
love
makes
all
safe
does
it
curdie
mother
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
feel
a
roughness
or
a
crack
or
a
big
joint
or
a
short
nail
your
hand
feels
just
and
exactly
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
and
it
not
more
than
two
hours
since
i
had
it
in
mine
well
i
will
say
very
like
indeed
to
that
of
the
old
princess
away
you
flatterer
said
his
mother
with
a
smile
that
showed
how
she
prized
the
love
that
lay
beneath
what
she
took
for
its
hyperbole
the
praise
even
which
one
can
not
accept
is
sweet
from
a
true
mouth
that
is
all
your
new
gift
can
do
it
wo
make
a
warlock
of
you
she
added
it
tells
me
nothing
but
the
truth
insisted
curdie
unlike
the
truth
it
may
seem
it
wants
no
gift
to
tell
what
outside
hands
are
like
but
by
it
i
know
your
inside
hands
are
like
the
princess
i
am
sure
the
boy
speaks
true
said
peter
only
says
about
your
hand
what
i
have
known
ever
so
long
about
yourself
joan
curdie
your
mother
foot
is
as
pretty
a
foot
as
any
lady
in
the
land
and
where
her
hand
is
not
so
pretty
it
comes
of
killing
its
beauty
for
you
and
me
my
boy
and
i
can
tell
you
more
curdie
i
do
know
much
about
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
i
am
sure
your
inside
mother
must
be
a
lady
as
her
hand
tells
you
and
i
will
try
to
say
how
i
know
it
this
is
how
when
i
forget
myself
looking
at
her
as
she
goes
about
her
work
and
that
happens
often
as
i
grow
older
i
fancy
for
a
moment
or
two
that
i
am
a
gentleman
and
when
i
wake
up
from
my
little
dream
it
is
only
to
feel
the
more
strongly
that
i
must
do
everything
as
a
gentleman
should
i
will
try
to
tell
you
what
i
mean
curdie
if
a
gentleman
i
mean
a
real
gentleman
not
a
pretended
one
of
which
sort
they
say
there
are
a
many
above
ground
if
a
real
gentleman
were
to
lose
all
his
money
and
come
down
to
work
in
the
mines
to
get
bread
for
his
family
do
you
think
curdie
he
would
work
like
the
lazy
ones
would
he
try
to
do
as
little
as
he
could
for
his
wages
i
know
the
sort
of
the
true
gentleman
pretty
near
as
well
as
he
does
himself
and
my
wife
that
your
mother
curdie
she
a
true
lady
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
for
it
she
that
makes
me
want
to
be
a
true
gentleman
wife
the
boy
is
in
the
right
about
your
hand
father
let
me
feel
yours
said
curdie
daring
a
little
more
no
my
boy
answered
peter
do
want
to
hear
anything
about
my
hand
or
my
head
or
my
heart
i
am
what
i
am
and
i
hope
growing
better
and
that
enough
no
you
sha
feel
my
hand
you
must
go
to
bed
for
you
must
start
with
the
sun
it
was
not
as
if
curdie
had
been
leaving
them
to
go
to
prison
or
to
make
a
fortune
and
although
they
were
sorry
enough
to
lose
him
they
were
not
in
the
least
heartbroken
or
even
troubled
at
his
going
as
the
princess
had
said
he
was
to
go
like
the
poor
man
he
was
curdie
came
down
in
the
morning
from
his
little
loft
dressed
in
his
working
clothes
his
mother
who
was
busy
getting
his
breakfast
for
him
while
his
father
sat
reading
to
her
out
of
an
old
book
would
have
had
him
put
on
his
holiday
garments
which
she
said
would
look
poor
enough
among
the
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
was
going
to
but
curdie
said
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
among
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
that
as
work
was
better
than
play
his
workday
clothes
must
on
the
whole
be
better
than
his
playday
clothes
and
as
his
father
accepted
the
argument
his
mother
gave
in
when
he
had
eaten
his
breakfast
she
took
a
pouch
made
of
goatskin
with
the
long
hair
on
it
filled
it
with
bread
and
cheese
and
hung
it
over
his
shoulder
then
his
father
gave
him
a
stick
he
had
cut
for
him
in
the
wood
and
he
bade
them
rather
hurriedly
for
he
was
afraid
of
breaking
down
as
he
went
out
he
caught
up
his
mattock
and
took
it
with
him
it
had
on
the
one
side
a
pointed
curve
of
strong
steel
for
loosening
the
earth
and
the
ore
and
on
the
other
a
steel
hammer
for
breaking
the
stones
and
rocks
just
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
the
sun
showed
the
first
segment
of
his
disc
above
the
horizon
chapter
the
heath
he
had
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
to
get
into
a
country
he
could
cross
for
the
mountains
to
the
north
were
full
of
precipices
and
it
would
have
been
losing
time
to
go
that
way
not
until
he
had
reached
the
king
house
was
it
any
use
to
turn
northwards
many
a
look
did
he
raise
as
he
passed
it
to
the
dove
tower
and
as
long
as
it
was
in
sight
but
he
saw
nothing
of
the
lady
of
the
pigeons
on
and
on
he
fared
and
came
in
a
few
hours
to
a
country
where
there
were
no
mountains
more
only
hills
with
great
stretches
of
desolate
heath
here
and
there
was
a
village
but
that
brought
him
little
pleasure
for
the
people
were
rougher
and
worse
mannered
than
those
in
the
mountains
and
as
he
passed
through
the
children
came
behind
and
mocked
him
a
monkey
running
away
from
the
mines
they
cried
sometimes
their
parents
came
out
and
encouraged
them
does
want
to
find
gold
for
the
king
any
longer
the
lazybones
they
would
say
be
well
taxed
down
here
though
and
he
like
that
either
but
it
was
little
to
curdie
that
men
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
about
should
not
approve
of
his
proceedings
he
gave
them
a
merry
answer
now
and
then
and
held
diligently
on
his
way
when
they
got
so
rude
as
nearly
to
make
him
angry
he
would
treat
them
as
he
used
to
treat
the
goblins
and
sing
his
own
songs
to
keep
out
their
foolish
noises
once
a
child
fell
as
he
turned
to
run
away
after
throwing
a
stone
at
him
he
picked
him
up
kissed
him
and
carried
him
to
his
mother
the
woman
had
run
out
in
terror
when
she
saw
the
strange
miner
about
as
she
thought
to
take
vengeance
on
her
boy
when
he
put
him
in
her
arms
she
blessed
him
and
curdie
went
on
his
way
rejoicing
and
so
the
day
went
on
and
the
evening
came
and
in
the
middle
of
a
great
desolate
heath
he
began
to
feel
tired
and
sat
down
under
an
ancient
hawthorn
through
which
every
now
and
then
a
lone
wind
that
seemed
to
come
from
nowhere
and
to
go
nowhither
sighed
and
hissed
it
was
very
old
and
distorted
there
was
not
another
tree
for
miles
all
around
it
seemed
to
have
lived
so
long
and
to
have
been
so
torn
and
tossed
by
the
tempests
on
that
moor
that
it
had
at
last
gathered
a
wind
of
its
own
which
got
up
now
and
then
tumbled
itself
about
and
lay
down
again
curdie
had
been
so
eager
to
get
on
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
his
breakfast
but
he
had
had
plenty
of
water
for
many
little
streams
had
crossed
his
path
he
now
opened
the
wallet
his
mother
had
given
him
and
began
to
eat
his
supper
the
sun
was
setting
a
few
clouds
had
gathered
about
the
west
but
there
was
not
a
single
cloud
anywhere
else
to
be
seen
now
curdie
did
not
know
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
country
very
hard
to
get
through
nobody
lived
there
though
many
had
tried
to
build
in
it
some
died
very
soon
some
rushed
out
of
it
those
who
stayed
longest
went
raving
mad
and
died
a
terrible
death
such
as
walked
straight
on
and
did
not
spend
a
night
there
got
through
well
and
were
nothing
the
worse
but
those
who
slept
even
a
single
night
in
it
were
sure
to
meet
with
something
they
could
never
forget
and
which
often
left
a
mark
everybody
could
read
and
that
old
hawthorn
might
have
been
enough
for
a
warning
it
looked
so
like
a
human
being
dried
up
and
distorted
with
age
and
suffering
with
cares
instead
of
loves
and
things
instead
of
thoughts
both
it
and
the
heath
around
it
which
stretched
on
all
sides
as
far
as
he
could
see
were
so
withered
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
they
were
alive
or
not
and
while
curdie
ate
there
came
a
change
clouds
had
gathered
over
his
head
and
seemed
drifting
about
in
every
direction
as
if
not
by
the
slow
unwilling
wind
but
hunted
in
all
directions
by
wolfish
flaws
across
the
plains
of
the
sky
the
sun
was
going
down
in
a
storm
of
lurid
crimson
and
out
of
the
west
came
a
wind
that
felt
red
and
hot
the
one
moment
and
cold
and
pale
the
other
and
very
strangely
it
sang
in
the
dreary
old
hawthorn
tree
and
very
cheerily
it
blew
about
curdie
now
making
him
creep
close
up
to
the
tree
for
shelter
from
its
shivery
cold
now
fan
himself
with
his
cap
it
was
so
sultry
and
stifling
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
deathbed
of
the
sun
dying
in
fever
and
ague
and
as
he
gazed
at
the
sun
now
on
the
verge
of
the
horizon
very
large
and
very
red
and
very
dull
for
though
the
clouds
had
broken
away
a
dusty
fog
was
spread
all
over
the
disc
curdie
saw
something
strange
appear
against
it
moving
about
like
a
fly
over
its
burning
face
this
looked
as
if
it
were
coming
out
of
the
sun
furnace
heart
and
was
a
living
creature
of
some
kind
surely
but
its
shape
was
very
uncertain
because
the
dazzle
of
the
light
all
around
melted
the
outlines
it
was
growing
larger
it
must
be
approaching
it
grew
so
rapidly
that
by
the
time
the
sun
was
half
down
its
head
reached
the
top
of
the
arch
and
presently
nothing
but
its
legs
were
to
be
seen
crossing
and
recrossing
the
face
of
the
vanishing
disc
when
the
sun
was
down
he
could
see
nothing
of
it
more
but
in
a
moment
he
heard
its
feet
galloping
over
the
dry
crackling
heather
and
seeming
to
come
straight
for
him
he
stood
up
lifted
his
pickaxes
and
threw
the
hammer
end
over
his
shoulder
he
was
going
to
have
a
fight
for
his
life
and
now
it
appeared
again
vague
yet
very
awful
in
the
dim
twilight
the
sun
had
left
behind
but
just
before
it
reached
him
down
from
its
four
long
legs
it
dropped
flat
on
the
ground
and
came
crawling
towards
him
wagging
a
huge
tail
as
it
came
chapter
lina
it
was
lina
all
at
once
curdie
recognized
her
the
frightful
creature
he
had
seen
at
the
princess
he
dropped
his
pickaxes
and
held
out
his
hand
she
crept
nearer
and
nearer
and
laid
her
chin
in
his
palm
and
he
patted
her
ugly
head
then
she
crept
away
behind
the
tree
and
lay
down
panting
hard
curdie
did
not
much
like
the
idea
of
her
being
behind
him
horrible
as
she
was
to
look
at
she
seemed
to
his
mind
more
horrible
when
he
was
not
looking
at
her
but
he
remembered
the
child
hand
and
never
thought
of
driving
her
away
now
and
then
he
gave
a
glance
behind
him
and
there
she
lay
flat
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
terrible
teeth
gleaming
between
her
two
huge
forepaws
after
his
supper
and
his
long
day
journey
it
was
no
wonder
curdie
should
now
be
sleepy
since
the
sun
set
the
air
had
been
warm
and
pleasant
he
lay
down
under
the
tree
closed
his
eyes
and
thought
to
sleep
he
found
himself
mistaken
however
but
although
he
could
not
sleep
he
was
yet
aware
of
resting
delightfully
presently
he
heard
a
sweet
sound
of
singing
somewhere
such
as
he
had
never
heard
before
a
singing
as
of
curious
birds
far
off
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
at
length
he
heard
their
wings
and
opening
his
eyes
saw
a
number
of
very
large
birds
as
it
seemed
alighting
around
him
still
singing
it
was
strange
to
hear
song
from
the
throats
of
such
big
birds
and
still
singing
with
large
and
round
but
not
the
less
birdlike
voices
they
began
to
weave
a
strange
dance
about
him
moving
their
wings
in
time
with
their
legs
but
the
dance
seemed
somehow
to
be
troubled
and
broken
and
to
return
upon
itself
in
an
eddy
in
place
of
sweeping
smoothly
on
and
he
soon
learned
in
the
low
short
growls
behind
him
the
cause
of
the
imperfection
they
wanted
to
dance
all
round
the
tree
but
lina
would
not
permit
them
to
come
on
her
side
now
curdie
liked
the
birds
and
did
not
altogether
like
lina
but
neither
nor
both
together
made
a
reason
for
driving
away
the
princess
creature
doubtless
she
had
been
the
goblins
creature
but
the
last
time
he
saw
her
was
in
the
king
house
and
the
dove
tower
and
at
the
old
princess
feet
so
he
left
her
to
do
as
she
would
and
the
dance
of
the
birds
continued
only
a
semicircle
troubled
at
the
edges
and
returning
upon
itself
but
their
song
and
their
motions
nevertheless
and
the
waving
of
their
wings
began
at
length
to
make
him
very
sleepy
all
the
time
he
had
kept
doubting
whether
they
could
really
be
birds
and
the
sleepier
he
got
the
more
he
imagined
them
something
else
but
he
suspected
no
harm
suddenly
just
as
he
was
sinking
beneath
the
waves
of
slumber
he
awoke
in
fierce
pain
the
birds
were
upon
him
all
over
him
and
had
begun
to
tear
him
with
beaks
and
claws
he
had
but
time
however
to
feel
that
he
could
not
move
under
their
weight
when
they
set
up
a
hideous
screaming
and
scattered
like
a
cloud
lina
was
among
them
snapping
and
striking
with
her
paws
while
her
tail
knocked
them
over
and
over
but
they
flew
up
gathered
and
descended
on
her
in
a
swarm
perching
upon
every
part
of
her
body
so
that
he
could
see
only
a
huge
misshapen
mass
which
seemed
to
go
rolling
away
into
the
darkness
he
got
up
and
tried
to
follow
but
could
see
nothing
and
after
wandering
about
hither
and
thither
for
some
time
found
himself
again
beside
the
hawthorn
he
feared
greatly
that
the
birds
had
been
too
much
for
lina
and
had
torn
her
to
pieces
in
a
little
while
however
she
came
limping
back
and
lay
down
in
her
old
place
curdie
also
lay
down
but
from
the
pain
of
his
wounds
there
was
no
sleep
for
him
when
the
light
came
he
found
his
clothes
a
good
deal
torn
and
his
skin
as
well
but
gladly
wondered
why
the
wicked
birds
had
not
at
once
attacked
his
eyes
then
he
turned
looking
for
lina
she
rose
and
crept
to
him
but
she
was
in
far
worse
plight
than
he
plucked
and
gashed
and
torn
with
the
beaks
and
claws
of
the
birds
especially
about
the
bare
part
of
her
neck
so
that
she
was
pitiful
to
see
and
those
worst
wounds
she
could
not
reach
to
lick
lina
said
curdie
got
all
those
helping
me
she
wagged
her
tail
and
made
it
clear
she
understood
him
then
it
flashed
upon
curdie
mind
that
perhaps
this
was
the
companion
the
princess
had
promised
him
for
the
princess
did
so
many
things
differently
from
what
anybody
looked
for
lina
was
no
beauty
certainly
but
already
the
first
night
she
had
saved
his
life
along
lina
he
said
want
water
she
put
her
nose
to
the
earth
and
after
snuffing
for
a
moment
darted
off
in
a
straight
line
curdie
followed
the
ground
was
so
uneven
that
after
losing
sight
of
her
many
times
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
lost
her
altogether
in
a
few
minutes
however
he
came
upon
her
waiting
for
him
instantly
she
darted
off
again
after
he
had
lost
and
found
her
again
many
times
he
found
her
the
last
time
lying
beside
a
great
stone
as
soon
as
he
came
up
she
began
scratching
at
it
with
her
paws
when
he
had
raised
it
an
inch
or
two
she
shoved
in
first
her
nose
and
then
her
teeth
and
lifted
with
all
the
might
of
her
neck
when
at
length
between
them
they
got
it
up
there
was
a
beautiful
little
well
he
filled
his
cap
with
the
clearest
and
sweetest
water
and
drank
then
he
gave
to
lina
and
she
drank
plentifully
next
he
washed
her
wounds
very
carefully
and
as
he
did
so
he
noted
how
much
the
bareness
of
her
neck
added
to
the
strange
repulsiveness
of
her
appearance
then
he
bethought
him
of
the
goatskin
wallet
his
mother
had
given
him
and
taking
it
from
his
shoulders
tried
whether
it
would
do
to
make
a
collar
of
for
the
poor
animal
he
found
there
was
just
enough
and
the
hair
so
similar
in
colour
to
lina
that
no
one
could
suspect
it
of
having
grown
somewhere
else
he
took
his
knife
ripped
up
the
seams
of
the
wallet
and
began
trying
the
skin
to
her
neck
it
was
plain
she
understood
perfectly
what
he
wished
for
she
endeavoured
to
hold
her
neck
conveniently
turning
it
this
way
and
that
while
he
contrived
with
his
rather
scanty
material
to
make
the
collar
fit
as
his
mother
had
taken
care
to
provide
him
with
needles
and
thread
he
soon
had
a
nice
gorget
ready
for
her
he
laced
it
on
with
one
of
his
boot
laces
which
its
long
hair
covered
poor
lina
looked
much
better
in
it
nor
could
any
one
have
called
it
a
piece
of
finery
if
ever
green
eyes
with
a
yellow
light
in
them
looked
grateful
hers
did
as
they
had
no
longer
any
bag
to
carry
them
in
curdie
and
lina
now
ate
what
was
left
of
the
provisions
then
they
set
out
again
upon
their
journey
for
seven
days
it
lasted
they
met
with
various
adventures
and
in
all
of
them
lina
proved
so
helpful
and
so
ready
to
risk
her
life
for
the
sake
of
her
companion
that
curdie
grew
not
merely
very
fond
but
very
trustful
of
her
and
her
ugliness
which
at
first
only
moved
his
pity
now
actually
increased
his
affection
for
her
one
day
looking
at
her
stretched
on
the
grass
before
him
he
said
lina
if
the
princess
would
but
burn
you
in
her
fire
of
roses
she
looked
up
at
him
gave
a
mournful
whine
like
a
dog
and
laid
her
head
on
his
feet
what
or
how
much
he
could
not
tell
but
clearly
she
had
gathered
something
from
his
words
chapter
more
creatures
one
day
from
morning
till
night
they
had
been
passing
through
a
forest
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
down
curdie
began
to
be
aware
that
there
were
more
in
it
than
themselves
first
he
saw
only
the
swift
rush
of
a
figure
across
the
trees
at
some
distance
then
he
saw
another
and
then
another
at
shorter
intervals
then
he
saw
others
both
farther
off
and
nearer
at
last
missing
lina
and
looking
about
after
her
he
saw
an
appearance
as
marvellous
as
herself
steal
up
to
her
and
begin
conversing
with
her
after
some
beast
fashion
which
evidently
she
understood
presently
what
seemed
a
quarrel
arose
between
them
and
stranger
noises
followed
mingled
with
growling
at
length
it
came
to
a
fight
which
had
not
lasted
long
however
before
the
creature
of
the
wood
threw
itself
upon
its
back
and
held
up
its
paws
to
lina
she
instantly
walked
on
and
the
creature
got
up
and
followed
her
they
had
not
gone
far
before
another
strange
animal
appeared
approaching
lina
when
precisely
the
same
thing
was
repeated
the
vanquished
animal
rising
and
following
with
the
former
again
and
yet
again
and
again
a
fresh
animal
came
up
seemed
to
be
reasoned
and
certainly
was
fought
with
and
overcome
by
lina
until
at
last
before
they
were
out
of
the
wood
she
was
followed
by
of
the
most
grotesquely
ugly
the
most
extravagantly
abnormal
animals
imagination
can
conceive
to
describe
them
were
a
hopeless
task
i
knew
a
boy
who
used
to
make
animals
out
of
heather
roots
wherever
he
could
find
four
legs
he
was
pretty
sure
to
find
a
head
and
a
tail
his
beasts
were
a
most
comic
menagerie
and
right
fruitful
of
laughter
but
they
were
not
so
grotesque
and
extravagant
as
lina
and
her
followers
one
of
them
for
instance
was
like
a
boa
constrictor
walking
on
four
little
stumpy
legs
near
its
tail
about
the
same
distance
from
its
head
were
two
little
wings
which
it
was
forever
fluttering
as
if
trying
to
fly
with
them
curdie
thought
it
fancied
it
did
fly
with
them
when
it
was
merely
plodding
on
busily
with
its
four
little
stumps
how
it
managed
to
keep
up
he
could
not
think
till
once
when
he
missed
it
from
the
group
the
same
moment
he
caught
sight
of
something
at
a
distance
plunging
at
an
awful
serpentine
rate
through
the
trees
and
presently
from
behind
a
huge
ash
this
same
creature
fell
again
into
the
group
quietly
waddling
along
on
its
four
stumps
watching
it
after
this
he
saw
that
when
it
was
not
able
to
keep
up
any
longer
and
they
had
all
got
a
little
space
ahead
it
shot
into
the
wood
away
from
the
route
and
made
a
great
round
serpentine
alone
in
huge
billows
of
motion
devouring
the
ground
undulating
awfully
galloping
as
if
it
were
all
legs
together
and
its
four
stumps
nowhere
in
this
mad
fashion
it
shot
ahead
and
a
few
minutes
after
toddled
in
again
among
the
rest
walking
peacefully
and
somewhat
painfully
on
its
few
fours
from
the
time
it
takes
to
describe
one
of
them
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
it
would
hardly
do
to
attempt
a
description
of
each
of
the
they
were
not
a
goodly
company
but
well
worth
contemplating
nevertheless
and
curdie
had
been
too
long
used
to
the
goblins
creatures
in
the
mines
and
on
the
mountain
to
feel
the
least
uncomfortable
at
being
followed
by
such
a
herd
on
the
contrary
the
marvellous
vagaries
of
shape
they
manifested
amused
him
greatly
and
shortened
the
journey
much
before
they
were
all
gathered
however
it
had
got
so
dark
that
he
could
see
some
of
them
only
a
part
at
a
time
and
every
now
and
then
as
the
company
wandered
on
he
would
be
startled
by
some
extraordinary
limb
or
feature
undreamed
of
by
him
before
thrusting
itself
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
range
of
his
ken
probably
there
were
some
of
his
old
acquaintances
among
them
although
such
had
been
the
conditions
of
in
which
alone
he
had
ever
seen
any
of
them
that
it
was
not
like
he
would
be
able
to
identify
any
of
them
on
they
marched
solemnly
almost
in
silence
for
either
with
feet
or
voice
the
creatures
seldom
made
any
noise
by
the
time
they
reached
the
outside
of
the
wood
it
was
morning
twilight
into
the
open
trooped
the
strange
torrent
of
deformity
each
one
following
lina
suddenly
she
stopped
turned
towards
them
and
said
something
which
they
understood
although
to
curdie
ear
the
sounds
she
made
seemed
to
have
no
articulation
instantly
they
all
turned
and
vanished
in
the
forest
and
lina
alone
came
trotting
lithely
and
clumsily
after
her
master
chapter
the
baker
wife
they
were
now
passing
through
a
lovely
country
of
hill
and
dale
and
rushing
stream
the
hills
were
abrupt
with
broken
chasms
for
watercourses
and
deep
little
valleys
full
of
trees
but
now
and
then
they
came
to
a
larger
valley
with
a
fine
river
whose
level
banks
and
the
adjacent
meadows
were
dotted
all
over
with
red
and
white
kine
while
on
the
fields
above
that
sloped
a
little
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
grew
oats
and
barley
and
wheat
and
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
themselves
vines
hung
and
chestnuts
rose
they
came
at
last
to
a
broad
beautiful
river
up
which
they
must
go
to
arrive
at
the
city
of
gwyntystorm
where
the
king
had
his
court
as
they
went
the
valley
narrowed
and
then
the
river
but
still
it
was
wide
enough
for
large
boats
after
this
while
the
river
kept
its
size
the
banks
narrowed
until
there
was
only
room
for
a
road
between
the
river
and
the
great
cliffs
that
overhung
it
at
last
river
and
road
took
a
sudden
turn
and
lo
a
great
rock
in
the
river
which
dividing
flowed
around
it
and
on
the
top
of
the
rock
the
city
with
lofty
walls
and
towers
and
battlements
and
above
the
city
the
palace
of
the
king
built
like
a
strong
castle
but
the
fortifications
had
long
been
neglected
for
the
whole
country
was
now
under
one
king
and
all
men
said
there
was
no
more
need
for
weapons
or
walls
no
man
pretended
to
love
his
neighbour
but
every
one
said
he
knew
that
peace
and
quiet
behaviour
was
the
best
thing
for
himself
and
that
he
said
was
quite
as
useful
and
a
great
deal
more
reasonable
the
city
was
prosperous
and
rich
and
if
everybody
was
not
comfortable
everybody
else
said
he
ought
to
be
when
curdie
got
up
opposite
the
mighty
rock
which
sparkled
all
over
with
crystals
he
found
a
narrow
bridge
defended
by
gates
and
portcullis
and
towers
with
loopholes
but
the
gates
stood
wide
open
and
were
dropping
from
their
great
hinges
the
portcullis
was
eaten
away
with
rust
and
clung
to
the
grooves
evidently
immovable
while
the
loopholed
towers
had
neither
floor
nor
roof
and
their
tops
were
fast
filling
up
their
interiors
curdie
thought
it
a
pity
if
only
for
their
old
story
that
they
should
be
thus
neglected
but
everybody
in
the
city
regarded
these
signs
of
decay
as
the
best
proof
of
the
prosperity
of
the
place
commerce
and
they
said
had
got
the
better
of
violence
and
the
troubles
of
the
past
were
whelmed
in
the
riches
that
flowed
in
at
their
open
gates
indeed
there
was
one
sect
of
philosophers
in
it
which
taught
that
it
would
be
better
to
forget
all
the
past
history
of
the
city
were
it
not
that
its
former
imperfections
taught
its
present
inhabitants
how
superior
they
and
their
times
were
and
enabled
them
to
glory
over
their
ancestors
there
were
even
certain
quacks
in
the
city
who
advertised
pills
for
enabling
people
to
think
well
of
themselves
and
some
few
bought
of
them
but
most
laughed
and
said
with
evident
truth
that
they
did
not
require
them
indeed
the
general
theme
of
discourse
when
they
met
was
how
much
wiser
they
were
than
their
fathers
curdie
crossed
the
river
and
began
to
ascend
the
winding
road
that
led
up
to
the
city
they
met
a
good
many
idlers
and
all
stared
at
them
it
was
no
wonder
they
should
stare
but
there
was
an
unfriendliness
in
their
looks
which
curdie
did
not
like
no
one
however
offered
them
any
molestation
lina
did
not
invite
liberties
after
a
long
ascent
they
reached
the
principal
gate
of
the
city
and
entered
the
street
was
very
steep
ascending
toward
the
palace
which
rose
in
great
strength
above
all
the
houses
just
as
they
entered
a
baker
whose
shop
was
a
few
doors
inside
the
gate
came
out
in
his
white
apron
and
ran
to
the
shop
of
his
friend
the
barber
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
but
as
he
ran
he
stumbled
and
fell
heavily
curdie
hastened
to
help
him
up
and
found
he
had
bruised
his
forehead
badly
he
swore
grievously
at
the
stone
for
tripping
him
up
declaring
it
was
the
third
time
he
had
fallen
over
it
within
the
last
month
and
saying
what
was
the
king
about
that
he
allowed
such
a
stone
to
stick
up
forever
on
the
main
street
of
his
royal
residence
of
gwyntystorm
what
was
a
king
for
if
he
would
not
take
care
of
his
people
heads
and
he
stroked
his
forehead
tenderly
it
your
head
or
your
feet
that
ought
to
bear
the
blame
of
your
fall
asked
curdie
you
booby
of
a
miner
my
feet
of
course
answered
the
baker
then
said
curdie
king
ca
be
to
blame
i
see
said
the
baker
laying
a
trap
for
me
of
course
if
you
come
to
that
it
was
my
head
that
ought
to
have
looked
after
my
feet
but
it
is
the
king
part
to
look
after
us
all
and
have
his
streets
smooth
i
do
see
said
curdie
the
king
should
take
care
of
the
baker
when
the
baker
head
wo
take
care
of
the
baker
feet
are
you
to
make
game
of
the
king
baker
cried
the
man
in
a
rage
but
instead
of
answering
curdie
went
up
to
the
bump
on
the
street
which
had
repeated
itself
on
the
baker
head
and
turning
the
hammer
end
of
his
mattock
struck
it
such
a
blow
that
it
flew
wide
in
pieces
blow
after
blow
he
struck
until
he
had
levelled
it
with
the
street
but
out
flew
the
barber
upon
him
in
a
rage
do
you
break
my
window
for
you
rascal
with
your
pickaxe
am
very
sorry
said
curdie
must
have
been
a
bit
of
stone
that
flew
from
my
mattock
i
could
help
it
you
know
help
it
a
fine
story
what
do
you
go
breaking
the
rock
for
the
very
rock
upon
which
the
city
stands
at
your
friend
forehead
said
curdie
what
a
lump
he
has
got
on
it
with
falling
over
that
same
stone
that
to
my
window
cried
the
barber
forehead
can
mend
itself
my
poor
window
ca
he
the
king
baker
said
curdie
more
and
more
surprised
at
the
man
anger
that
to
me
this
is
a
free
city
every
man
here
takes
care
of
himself
and
the
king
takes
care
of
us
all
i
have
the
price
of
my
window
out
of
you
or
the
exchequer
shall
pay
for
it
something
caught
curdie
eye
he
stooped
picked
up
a
piece
of
the
stone
he
had
just
broken
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
suppose
you
are
going
to
break
another
of
my
windows
with
that
stone
said
the
barber
no
said
curdie
did
mean
to
break
your
window
and
i
certainly
wo
break
another
me
that
stone
said
the
barber
curdie
gave
it
him
and
the
barber
threw
it
over
the
city
wall
thought
you
wanted
the
stone
said
curdie
you
fool
answered
the
barber
should
i
want
with
a
stone
curdie
stooped
and
picked
up
another
me
that
stone
said
the
barber
answered
curdie
have
just
told
me
you
do
want
a
stone
and
i
do
the
barber
took
curdie
by
the
collar
now
you
pay
me
for
that
window
much
asked
curdie
the
barber
said
crown
but
the
baker
annoyed
at
the
heartlessness
of
the
barber
in
thinking
more
of
his
broken
window
than
the
bump
on
his
friend
forehead
interfered
no
he
said
to
curdie
you
pay
any
such
sum
a
little
pane
like
that
cost
only
a
quarter
to
be
certain
said
curdie
give
a
half
for
he
doubted
the
baker
as
well
as
the
barber
one
day
if
he
finds
he
has
asked
too
much
he
will
bring
me
the
difference
ha
laughed
the
barber
fool
and
his
money
are
soon
parted
but
as
he
took
the
coin
from
curdie
hand
he
grasped
it
in
affected
reconciliation
and
real
satisfaction
in
curdie
his
was
the
cold
smooth
leathery
palm
of
a
monkey
he
looked
up
almost
expecting
to
see
him
pop
the
money
in
his
cheek
but
he
had
not
yet
got
so
far
as
that
though
he
was
well
on
the
road
to
it
then
he
would
have
no
other
pocket
glad
that
stone
is
gone
anyhow
said
the
baker
was
the
bane
of
my
life
i
had
no
idea
how
easy
it
was
to
remove
it
give
me
your
pickaxes
young
miner
and
i
will
show
you
how
a
baker
can
make
the
stones
fly
he
caught
the
tool
out
of
curdie
hand
and
flew
at
one
of
the
foundation
stones
of
the
gateway
but
he
jarred
his
arm
terribly
scarcely
chipped
the
stone
dropped
the
mattock
with
a
cry
of
pain
and
ran
into
his
own
shop
curdie
picked
up
his
implement
and
looking
after
the
baker
saw
bread
in
the
window
and
followed
him
in
but
the
baker
ashamed
of
himself
and
thinking
he
was
coming
to
laugh
at
him
popped
out
of
the
back
door
and
when
curdie
entered
the
baker
wife
came
from
the
bakehouse
to
serve
him
curdie
requested
to
know
the
price
of
a
certain
loaf
now
the
baker
wife
had
been
watching
what
had
passed
since
first
her
husband
ran
out
of
the
shop
and
she
liked
the
look
of
curdie
also
she
was
more
honest
than
her
husband
casting
a
glance
to
the
back
door
she
replied
is
not
the
best
bread
i
will
sell
you
a
loaf
of
what
we
bake
for
ourselves
and
when
she
had
spoken
she
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
care
of
yourself
in
this
place
my
son
she
added
do
not
love
strangers
i
was
once
a
stranger
here
and
i
know
what
i
say
then
fancying
she
heard
her
husband
is
a
strange
animal
you
have
she
said
in
a
louder
voice
answered
curdie
is
no
beauty
but
she
is
very
good
and
we
love
each
other
do
we
lina
lina
looked
up
and
whined
curdie
threw
her
the
half
of
his
loaf
which
she
ate
while
her
master
and
the
baker
wife
talked
a
little
then
the
baker
wife
gave
them
some
water
and
curdie
having
paid
for
his
loaf
he
and
lina
went
up
the
street
together
chapter
the
dogs
of
gwyntystorm
the
steep
street
led
them
straight
up
to
a
large
market
place
with
butchers
shops
about
which
were
many
dogs
the
moment
they
caught
sight
of
lina
one
and
all
they
came
rushing
down
upon
her
giving
her
no
chance
of
explaining
herself
when
curdie
saw
the
dogs
coming
he
heaved
up
his
mattock
over
his
shoulder
and
was
ready
if
they
would
have
it
so
seeing
him
thus
prepared
to
defend
his
follower
a
great
ugly
bulldog
flew
at
him
with
the
first
blow
curdie
struck
him
through
the
brain
and
the
brute
fell
dead
at
his
feet
but
he
could
not
at
once
recover
his
weapon
which
stuck
in
the
skull
of
his
foe
and
a
huge
mastiff
seeing
him
thus
hampered
flew
at
him
next
now
lina
who
had
shown
herself
so
brave
upon
the
road
thither
had
grown
shy
upon
entering
the
city
and
kept
always
at
curdie
heel
but
it
was
her
turn
now
the
moment
she
saw
her
master
in
danger
she
seemed
to
go
mad
with
rage
as
the
mastiff
jumped
at
curdie
throat
lina
flew
at
him
seized
him
with
her
tremendous
jaws
gave
one
roaring
grind
and
he
lay
beside
the
bulldog
with
his
neck
broken
they
were
the
best
dogs
in
the
market
after
the
judgement
of
the
butchers
of
gwyntystorm
down
came
their
masters
knives
in
hand
curdie
drew
himself
up
fearlessly
mattock
on
shoulder
and
awaited
their
coming
while
at
his
heel
his
awful
attendant
showed
not
only
her
outside
fringe
of
icicle
teeth
but
a
double
row
of
right
serviceable
fangs
she
wore
inside
her
mouth
and
her
green
eyes
flashed
yellow
as
gold
the
butchers
not
liking
the
look
of
either
of
them
or
of
the
dogs
at
their
feet
drew
back
and
began
to
remonstrate
in
the
manner
of
outraged
men
said
the
first
bulldog
is
mine
him
then
said
curdie
indignant
killed
him
else
he
would
have
killed
me
no
business
of
mine
makes
it
the
more
mine
then
sort
of
thing
wo
do
you
know
said
the
other
butcher
true
said
curdie
my
mastiff
said
the
butcher
as
he
ought
to
be
said
curdie
brute
shall
be
burned
alive
for
it
said
the
butcher
yet
answered
curdie
have
done
no
wrong
we
were
walking
quietly
up
your
street
when
your
dogs
flew
at
us
if
you
do
teach
your
dogs
how
to
treat
strangers
you
must
take
the
consequences
treat
them
quite
properly
said
the
butcher
right
has
any
one
to
bring
an
abomination
like
that
into
our
city
the
horror
is
enough
to
make
an
idiot
of
every
child
in
the
place
are
both
subjects
of
the
king
and
my
poor
animal
ca
help
her
looks
how
would
you
like
to
be
served
like
that
because
you
were
ugly
she
not
a
bit
fonder
of
her
looks
than
you
are
only
what
can
she
do
to
change
them
do
to
change
them
said
the
fellow
thereupon
the
butchers
brandished
their
long
knives
and
advanced
keeping
their
eyes
upon
lina
be
afraid
lina
cried
curdie
kill
one
you
kill
the
other
lina
gave
a
howl
that
might
have
terrified
an
army
and
crouched
ready
to
spring
the
butchers
turned
and
ran
by
this
time
a
great
crowd
had
gathered
behind
the
butchers
and
in
it
a
number
of
boys
returning
from
school
who
began
to
stone
the
strangers
it
was
a
way
they
had
with
man
or
beast
they
did
not
expect
to
make
anything
by
one
of
the
stones
struck
lina
she
caught
it
in
her
teeth
and
crunched
it
so
that
it
fell
in
gravel
from
her
mouth
some
of
the
foremost
of
the
crowd
saw
this
and
it
terrified
them
they
drew
back
the
rest
took
fright
from
their
retreat
the
panic
spread
and
at
last
the
crowd
scattered
in
all
directions
they
ran
and
cried
out
and
said
the
devil
and
his
dam
were
come
to
gwyntystorm
so
curdie
and
lina
were
left
standing
unmolested
in
the
market
place
but
the
terror
of
them
spread
throughout
the
city
and
everybody
began
to
shut
and
lock
his
door
so
that
by
the
time
the
setting
sun
shone
down
the
street
there
was
not
a
shop
left
open
for
fear
of
the
devil
and
his
horrible
dam
but
all
the
upper
windows
within
sight
of
them
were
crowded
with
heads
watching
them
where
they
stood
lonely
in
the
deserted
market
place
curdie
looked
carefully
all
round
but
could
not
see
one
open
door
he
caught
sight
of
the
sign
of
an
inn
however
and
laying
down
his
mattock
and
telling
lina
to
take
care
of
it
walked
up
to
the
door
of
it
and
knocked
but
the
people
in
the
house
instead
of
opening
the
door
threw
things
at
him
from
the
windows
they
would
not
listen
to
a
word
he
said
but
sent
him
back
to
lina
with
the
blood
running
down
his
face
when
lina
saw
that
she
leaped
up
in
a
fury
and
was
rushing
at
the
house
into
which
she
would
certainly
have
broken
but
curdie
called
her
and
made
her
lie
down
beside
him
while
he
bethought
him
what
next
he
should
do
he
said
people
keep
their
gates
open
but
their
houses
and
their
hearts
shut
as
if
she
knew
it
was
her
presence
that
had
brought
this
trouble
upon
him
she
rose
and
went
round
and
round
him
purring
like
a
tigress
and
rubbing
herself
against
his
legs
now
there
was
one
little
thatched
house
that
stood
squeezed
in
between
two
tall
gables
and
the
sides
of
the
two
great
houses
shot
out
projecting
windows
that
nearly
met
across
the
roof
of
the
little
one
so
that
it
lay
in
the
street
like
a
doll
house
in
this
house
lived
a
poor
old
woman
with
a
grandchild
and
because
she
never
gossiped
or
quarrelled
or
chaffered
in
the
market
but
went
without
what
she
could
not
afford
the
people
called
her
a
witch
and
would
have
done
her
many
an
ill
turn
if
they
had
not
been
afraid
of
her
now
while
curdie
was
looking
in
another
direction
the
door
opened
and
out
came
a
little
child
and
toddled
across
the
market
place
toward
the
outcasts
the
moment
they
saw
her
coming
lina
lay
down
flat
on
the
road
and
with
her
two
huge
forepaws
covered
her
mouth
while
curdie
went
to
meet
her
holding
out
his
arms
the
little
one
came
straight
to
him
and
held
up
her
mouth
to
be
kissed
then
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
toward
the
house
and
curdie
yielded
to
the
silent
invitation
but
when
lina
rose
to
follow
the
child
shrank
from
her
frightened
a
little
curdie
took
her
up
and
holding
her
on
one
arm
patted
lina
with
the
other
hand
then
the
child
wanted
also
to
pat
doggy
as
she
called
her
by
a
right
bountiful
stretch
of
courtesy
and
having
once
patted
her
nothing
would
serve
but
curdie
must
let
her
have
a
ride
on
doggy
so
he
set
her
on
lina
back
holding
her
hand
and
she
rode
home
in
merry
triumph
all
unconscious
of
the
hundreds
of
eyes
staring
at
her
foolhardiness
from
the
windows
about
the
market
place
or
the
murmur
of
deep
disapproval
that
rose
from
as
many
lips
at
the
door
stood
the
grandmother
to
receive
them
she
caught
the
child
to
her
bosom
with
delight
at
her
courage
welcomed
curdie
and
showed
no
dread
of
lina
many
were
the
significant
nods
exchanged
and
many
a
one
said
to
another
that
the
devil
and
the
witch
were
old
friends
but
the
woman
was
only
a
wise
woman
who
having
seen
how
curdie
and
lina
behaved
to
each
other
judged
from
that
what
sort
they
were
and
so
made
them
welcome
to
her
house
she
was
not
like
her
fellow
townspeople
for
that
they
were
strangers
recommended
them
to
her
the
moment
her
door
was
shut
the
other
doors
began
to
open
and
soon
there
appeared
little
groups
here
and
there
about
a
threshold
while
a
few
of
the
more
courageous
ventured
out
upon
the
square
all
ready
to
make
for
their
houses
again
however
upon
the
least
sign
of
movement
in
the
little
thatched
one
the
baker
and
the
barber
had
joined
one
of
these
groups
and
were
busily
wagging
their
tongues
against
curdie
and
his
horrible
beast
ca
be
honest
said
the
barber
he
paid
me
double
the
worth
of
the
pane
he
broke
in
my
window
and
then
he
told
them
how
curdie
broke
his
window
by
breaking
a
stone
in
the
street
with
his
hammer
there
the
baker
struck
in
that
was
the
stone
said
he
which
i
had
fallen
three
times
within
the
last
month
could
it
be
by
fair
means
he
broke
that
to
pieces
at
the
first
blow
just
to
make
up
my
mind
on
that
point
i
tried
his
own
hammer
against
a
stone
in
the
gate
it
nearly
broke
both
my
arms
and
loosened
half
the
teeth
in
my
head
chapter
derba
and
barbara
meantime
the
wanderers
were
hospitably
entertained
by
the
old
woman
and
her
grandchild
and
they
were
all
very
comfortable
and
happy
together
little
barbara
sat
upon
curdie
knee
and
he
told
her
stories
about
the
mines
and
his
adventures
in
them
but
he
never
mentioned
the
king
or
the
princess
for
all
that
story
was
hard
to
believe
and
he
told
her
about
his
mother
and
father
and
how
good
they
were
and
derba
sat
and
listened
at
last
little
barbara
fell
asleep
in
curdie
arms
and
her
grandmother
carried
her
to
bed
it
was
a
poor
little
house
and
derba
gave
up
her
own
room
to
curdie
because
he
was
honest
and
talked
wisely
curdie
saw
how
it
was
and
begged
her
to
allow
him
to
lie
on
the
floor
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
in
the
night
he
was
waked
by
lina
pulling
at
him
as
soon
as
he
spoke
to
her
she
ceased
and
curdie
listening
thought
he
heard
someone
trying
to
get
in
he
rose
took
his
mattock
and
went
about
the
house
listening
and
watching
but
although
he
heard
noises
now
at
one
place
now
at
another
he
could
not
think
what
they
meant
for
no
one
appeared
certainly
considering
how
she
had
frightened
them
all
in
the
day
it
was
not
likely
any
one
would
attack
lina
at
night
by
and
by
the
noises
ceased
and
curdie
went
back
to
his
bed
and
slept
undisturbed
in
the
morning
however
derba
came
to
him
in
great
agitation
and
said
they
had
fastened
up
the
door
so
that
she
could
not
get
out
curdie
rose
immediately
and
went
with
her
they
found
that
not
only
the
door
but
every
window
in
the
house
was
so
secured
on
the
outside
that
it
was
impossible
to
open
one
of
them
without
using
great
force
poor
derba
looked
anxiously
in
curdie
face
he
broke
out
laughing
are
much
mistaken
he
said
they
fancy
they
could
keep
lina
and
a
miner
in
any
house
in
gwyntystorm
even
if
they
built
up
doors
and
windows
with
that
he
shouldered
his
mattock
but
derba
begged
him
not
to
make
a
hole
in
her
house
just
yet
she
had
plenty
for
breakfast
she
said
and
before
it
was
time
for
dinner
they
would
know
what
the
people
meant
by
it
and
indeed
they
did
for
within
an
hour
appeared
one
of
the
chief
magistrates
of
the
city
accompanied
by
a
score
of
soldiers
with
drawn
swords
and
followed
by
a
great
multitude
of
people
requiring
the
miner
and
his
brute
to
yield
themselves
the
one
that
he
might
be
tried
for
the
disturbance
he
had
occasioned
and
the
injury
he
had
committed
the
other
that
she
might
be
roasted
alive
for
her
part
in
killing
two
valuable
and
harmless
animals
belonging
to
worthy
citizens
the
summons
was
preceded
and
followed
by
flourish
of
trumpet
and
was
read
with
every
formality
by
the
city
marshal
himself
the
moment
he
ended
lina
ran
into
the
little
passage
and
stood
opposite
the
door
surrender
cried
curdie
tie
up
your
brute
and
give
her
here
no
cried
curdie
through
the
door
surrender
but
i
not
going
to
do
your
hangman
work
if
you
want
my
dog
you
must
take
her
we
shall
set
the
house
on
fire
and
burn
witch
and
all
will
go
hard
with
us
but
we
shall
kill
a
few
dozen
of
you
first
cried
curdie
not
the
least
afraid
of
you
with
that
curdie
turned
to
derba
and
said
be
frightened
i
have
a
strong
feeling
that
all
will
be
well
surely
no
trouble
will
come
to
you
for
being
good
to
strangers
the
poor
dog
said
derba
now
curdie
and
lina
understood
each
other
more
than
a
little
by
this
time
and
not
only
had
he
seen
that
she
understood
the
proclamation
but
when
she
looked
up
at
him
after
it
was
read
it
was
with
such
a
grin
and
such
a
yellow
flash
that
he
saw
also
she
was
determined
to
take
care
of
herself
dog
will
probably
give
you
reason
to
think
a
little
more
of
her
ere
long
he
answered
now
he
went
on
fear
i
must
hurt
your
house
a
little
i
have
great
confidence
however
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
up
to
you
for
it
one
day
mind
the
house
if
only
you
can
get
safe
off
she
answered
do
think
they
will
hurt
this
precious
lamb
she
added
clasping
little
barbara
to
her
bosom
myself
it
is
all
one
i
am
ready
for
anything
is
but
a
little
hole
for
lina
i
want
to
make
said
curdie
can
creep
through
a
much
smaller
one
than
you
would
think
again
he
took
his
mattock
and
went
to
the
back
wall
wo
burn
the
house
he
said
to
himself
is
too
good
a
one
on
each
side
of
it
the
tumult
had
kept
increasing
every
moment
and
the
city
marshal
had
been
shouting
but
curdie
had
not
listened
to
him
when
now
they
heard
the
blows
of
his
mattock
there
went
up
a
great
cry
and
the
people
taunted
the
soldiers
that
they
were
afraid
of
a
dog
and
his
miner
the
soldiers
therefore
made
a
rush
at
the
door
and
cut
its
fastenings
the
moment
they
opened
it
out
leaped
lina
with
a
roar
so
unnaturally
horrible
that
the
sword
arms
of
the
soldiers
dropped
by
their
sides
paralysed
with
the
terror
of
that
cry
the
crowd
fled
in
every
direction
shrieking
and
yelling
with
mortal
dismay
and
without
even
knocking
down
with
her
tail
not
to
say
biting
a
man
of
them
with
her
pulverizing
jaws
lina
vanished
no
one
knew
whither
for
not
one
of
the
crowd
had
had
courage
to
look
upon
her
the
moment
she
was
gone
curdie
advanced
and
gave
himself
up
the
soldiers
were
so
filled
with
fear
shame
and
chagrin
that
they
were
ready
to
kill
him
on
the
spot
but
he
stood
quietly
facing
them
with
his
mattock
on
his
shoulder
and
the
magistrate
wishing
to
examine
him
and
the
people
to
see
him
made
an
example
of
the
soldiers
had
to
content
themselves
with
taking
him
partly
for
derision
partly
to
hurt
him
they
laid
his
mattock
against
his
back
and
tied
his
arms
to
it
they
led
him
up
a
very
steep
street
and
up
another
still
all
the
crowd
following
the
king
rose
towering
above
them
but
they
stopped
before
they
reached
it
at
a
door
in
a
great
dull
building
the
city
marshal
opened
it
with
a
key
which
hung
at
his
girdle
and
ordered
curdie
to
enter
the
place
within
was
dark
as
night
and
while
he
was
feeling
his
way
with
his
feet
the
marshal
gave
him
a
rough
push
he
fell
and
rolled
once
or
twice
over
unable
to
help
himself
because
his
hands
were
tied
behind
him
it
was
the
hour
of
the
magistrate
second
and
more
important
breakfast
and
until
that
was
over
he
never
found
himself
capable
of
attending
to
a
case
with
concentration
sufficient
to
the
distinguishing
of
the
side
upon
which
his
own
advantage
lay
and
hence
was
this
respite
for
curdie
with
time
to
collect
his
thoughts
but
indeed
he
had
very
few
to
collect
for
all
he
had
to
do
so
far
as
he
could
see
was
to
wait
for
what
would
come
next
neither
had
he
much
power
to
collect
them
for
he
was
a
good
deal
shaken
in
a
few
minutes
he
discovered
to
his
great
relief
that
from
the
projection
of
the
pick
end
of
his
mattock
beyond
his
body
the
fall
had
loosened
the
ropes
tied
round
it
he
got
one
hand
disengaged
and
then
the
other
and
presently
stood
free
with
his
good
mattock
once
more
in
right
serviceable
relation
to
his
arms
and
legs
chapter
the
mattock
while
the
magistrate
reinvigorated
his
selfishness
with
a
greedy
breakfast
curdie
found
doing
nothing
in
the
dark
rather
tiresome
work
it
was
useless
attempting
to
think
what
he
should
do
next
seeing
the
circumstances
in
which
he
was
presently
to
find
himself
were
altogether
unknown
to
him
so
he
began
to
think
about
his
father
and
mother
in
their
little
cottage
home
high
in
the
clear
air
of
the
open
mountainside
and
the
thought
instead
of
making
his
dungeon
gloomier
by
the
contrast
made
a
light
in
his
soul
that
destroyed
the
power
of
darkness
and
captivity
but
he
was
at
length
startled
from
his
waking
dream
by
a
swell
in
the
noise
outside
all
the
time
there
had
been
a
few
of
the
more
idle
of
the
inhabitants
about
the
door
but
they
had
been
rather
quiet
now
however
the
sounds
of
feet
and
voices
began
to
grow
and
grew
so
rapidly
that
it
was
plain
a
multitude
was
gathering
for
the
people
of
gwyntystorm
always
gave
themselves
an
hour
of
pleasure
after
their
second
breakfast
and
what
greater
pleasure
could
they
have
than
to
see
a
stranger
abused
by
the
officers
of
justice
the
noise
grew
till
it
was
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
and
that
roaring
went
on
a
long
time
for
the
magistrate
being
a
great
man
liked
to
know
that
he
was
waited
for
it
added
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
breakfast
and
indeed
enabled
him
to
eat
a
little
more
after
he
had
thought
his
powers
exhausted
but
at
length
in
the
waves
of
the
human
noises
rose
a
bigger
wave
and
by
the
running
and
shouting
and
outcry
curdie
learned
that
the
magistrate
was
approaching
presently
came
the
sound
of
the
great
rusty
key
in
the
lock
which
yielded
with
groaning
reluctance
the
door
was
thrown
back
the
light
rushed
in
and
with
it
came
the
voice
of
the
city
marshal
calling
upon
curdie
by
many
legal
epithets
opprobrious
to
come
forth
and
be
tried
for
his
life
inasmuch
as
he
had
raised
a
tumult
in
his
majesty
city
of
gwyntystorm
troubled
the
hearts
of
the
king
baker
and
barber
and
slain
the
faithful
dogs
of
his
majesty
butchers
he
was
still
reading
and
curdie
was
still
seated
in
the
brown
twilight
of
the
vault
not
listening
but
pondering
with
himself
how
this
king
the
city
marshal
talked
of
could
be
the
same
with
the
majesty
he
had
seen
ride
away
on
his
grand
white
horse
with
the
princess
irene
on
a
cushion
before
him
when
a
scream
of
agonized
terror
arose
on
the
farthest
skirt
of
the
crowd
and
swifter
than
flood
or
flame
the
horror
spread
shrieking
in
a
moment
the
air
was
filled
with
hideous
howling
cries
of
unspeakable
dismay
and
the
multitudinous
noise
of
running
feet
the
next
moment
in
at
the
door
of
the
vault
bounded
lina
her
two
green
eyes
flaming
yellow
as
sunflowers
and
seeming
to
light
up
the
dungeon
with
one
spring
she
threw
herself
at
feet
and
laid
her
head
upon
them
panting
then
came
a
rush
of
two
or
three
soldiers
darkening
the
doorway
but
it
was
only
to
lay
hold
of
the
key
pull
the
door
to
and
lock
it
so
that
once
more
curdie
and
lina
were
prisoners
together
for
a
few
moments
lina
lay
panting
hard
it
is
breathless
work
leaping
and
roaring
both
at
once
and
that
in
a
way
to
scatter
thousands
of
people
then
she
jumped
up
and
began
snuffing
about
all
over
the
place
and
curdie
saw
what
he
had
never
seen
before
two
faint
spots
of
light
cast
from
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
one
on
each
side
of
her
snuffing
nose
he
got
out
his
tinder
box
a
miner
is
never
without
one
and
lighted
a
precious
bit
of
candle
he
carried
in
a
division
of
it
just
for
a
moment
for
he
must
not
waste
it
the
light
revealed
a
vault
without
any
window
or
other
opening
than
the
door
it
was
very
old
and
much
neglected
the
mortar
had
vanished
from
between
the
stones
and
it
was
half
filled
with
a
heap
of
all
sorts
of
rubbish
beaten
down
in
the
middle
but
looser
at
the
sides
it
sloped
from
the
door
to
the
foot
of
the
opposite
wall
evidently
for
a
long
time
the
vault
had
been
left
open
and
every
sort
of
refuse
thrown
into
it
a
single
minute
served
for
the
survey
so
little
was
there
to
note
meantime
down
in
the
angle
between
the
back
wall
and
the
base
of
the
heap
lina
was
scratching
furiously
with
all
the
eighteen
great
strong
claws
of
her
mighty
feet
ha
said
curdie
to
himself
catching
sight
of
her
only
they
will
leave
us
long
enough
to
ourselves
with
that
he
ran
to
the
door
to
see
if
there
was
any
fastening
on
the
inside
there
was
none
in
all
its
long
history
it
never
had
had
one
but
a
few
blows
of
the
right
sort
now
from
the
one
now
from
the
other
end
of
his
mattock
were
as
good
as
any
bolt
for
they
so
ruined
the
lock
that
no
key
could
ever
turn
in
it
again
those
who
heard
them
fancied
he
was
trying
to
get
out
and
laughed
spitefully
as
soon
as
he
had
done
he
extinguished
his
candle
and
went
down
to
lina
she
had
reached
the
hard
rock
which
formed
the
floor
of
the
dungeon
and
was
now
clearing
away
the
earth
a
little
wider
presently
she
looked
up
in
his
face
and
whined
as
much
as
to
say
paws
are
not
hard
enough
to
get
any
farther
get
out
of
my
way
lina
said
curdie
and
mind
you
keep
your
eyes
shining
for
fear
i
should
hit
you
so
saying
he
heaved
his
mattock
and
assailed
with
the
hammer
end
of
it
the
spot
she
had
cleared
the
rock
was
very
hard
but
when
it
did
break
it
broke
in
pieces
now
with
hammer
now
with
pick
he
worked
till
he
was
weary
then
rested
and
then
set
to
again
he
could
not
tell
how
the
day
went
as
he
had
no
light
but
the
lamping
of
lina
eyes
the
darkness
hampered
him
greatly
for
he
would
not
let
lina
come
close
enough
to
give
him
all
the
light
she
could
lest
he
should
strike
her
so
he
had
every
now
and
then
to
feel
with
his
hands
to
know
how
he
was
getting
on
and
to
discover
in
what
direction
to
strike
the
exact
spot
was
a
mere
imagination
he
was
getting
very
tired
and
hungry
and
beginning
to
lose
heart
a
little
when
out
of
the
ground
as
if
he
had
struck
a
spring
of
it
burst
a
dull
gleamy
light
and
the
next
moment
he
heard
a
hollow
splash
and
echo
a
piece
of
rock
had
fallen
out
of
the
floor
and
dropped
into
water
beneath
already
lina
who
had
been
lying
a
few
yards
off
all
the
time
he
worked
was
on
her
feet
and
peering
through
the
hole
curdie
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
looked
they
were
over
what
seemed
a
natural
cave
in
the
rock
to
which
apparently
the
river
had
access
for
at
a
great
distance
below
a
faint
light
was
gleaming
upon
water
if
they
could
but
reach
it
they
might
get
out
but
even
if
it
was
deep
enough
the
height
was
very
dangerous
the
first
thing
whatever
might
follow
was
to
make
the
hole
larger
it
was
comparatively
easy
to
break
away
the
sides
of
it
and
in
the
course
of
another
hour
he
had
it
large
enough
to
get
through
and
now
he
must
reconnoitre
he
took
the
rope
they
had
tied
him
with
for
curdie
hindrances
were
always
his
furtherance
and
fastened
one
end
of
it
by
a
slipknot
round
the
handle
of
his
pickaxes
then
dropped
the
other
end
through
and
laid
the
pickaxe
so
that
when
he
was
through
himself
and
hanging
on
the
edge
he
could
place
it
across
the
hole
to
support
him
on
the
rope
this
done
he
took
the
rope
in
his
hands
and
beginning
to
descend
found
himself
in
a
narrow
cleft
widening
into
a
cave
his
rope
was
not
very
long
and
would
not
do
much
to
lessen
the
force
of
his
fall
he
thought
to
himself
if
he
should
have
to
drop
into
the
water
but
he
was
not
more
than
a
couple
of
yards
below
the
dungeon
when
he
spied
an
opening
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
cleft
it
might
be
but
a
shadow
hole
or
it
might
lead
them
out
he
dropped
himself
a
little
below
its
level
gave
the
rope
a
swing
by
pushing
his
feet
against
the
side
of
the
cleft
and
so
penduled
himself
into
it
then
he
laid
a
stone
on
the
end
of
the
rope
that
it
should
not
forsake
him
called
to
lina
whose
yellow
eyes
were
gleaming
over
the
mattock
grating
above
to
watch
there
till
he
returned
and
went
cautiously
in
it
proved
a
passage
level
for
some
distance
then
sloping
gently
up
he
advanced
carefully
feeling
his
way
as
he
went
at
length
he
was
stopped
by
a
door
a
small
door
studded
with
iron
but
the
wood
was
in
places
so
much
decayed
that
some
of
the
bolts
had
dropped
out
and
he
felt
sure
of
being
able
to
open
it
he
returned
therefore
to
fetch
lina
and
his
mattock
arrived
at
the
cleft
his
strong
miner
arms
bore
him
swiftly
up
along
the
rope
and
through
the
hole
into
the
dungeon
there
he
undid
the
rope
from
his
mattock
and
making
lina
take
the
end
of
it
in
her
teeth
and
get
through
the
hole
he
lowered
her
it
was
all
he
could
do
she
was
so
heavy
when
she
came
opposite
the
passage
with
a
slight
push
of
her
tail
she
shot
herself
into
it
and
let
go
the
rope
which
curdie
drew
up
then
he
lighted
his
candle
and
searching
in
the
rubbish
found
a
bit
of
iron
to
take
the
place
of
his
pickaxe
across
the
hole
then
he
searched
again
in
the
rubbish
and
found
half
an
old
shutter
this
he
propped
up
leaning
a
little
over
the
hole
with
a
bit
of
stick
and
heaped
against
the
back
of
it
a
quantity
of
the
loosened
earth
next
he
tied
his
mattock
to
the
end
of
the
rope
dropped
it
and
let
it
hang
last
he
got
through
the
hole
himself
and
pulled
away
the
propping
stick
so
that
the
shutter
fell
over
the
hole
with
a
quantity
of
earth
on
the
top
of
it
a
few
motions
of
hand
over
hand
and
he
swung
himself
and
his
mattock
into
the
passage
beside
lina
there
he
secured
the
end
of
the
rope
and
they
went
on
together
to
the
door
chapter
the
wine
cellar
he
lighted
his
candle
and
examined
it
decayed
and
broken
as
it
was
it
was
strongly
secured
in
its
place
by
hinges
on
the
one
side
and
either
lock
or
bolt
he
could
not
tell
which
on
the
other
a
brief
use
of
his
was
enough
to
make
room
for
his
hand
and
arm
to
get
through
and
then
he
found
a
great
iron
bolt
but
so
rusty
that
he
could
not
move
it
lina
whimpered
he
took
his
knife
again
made
the
hole
bigger
and
stood
back
in
she
shot
her
small
head
and
long
neck
seized
the
bolt
with
her
teeth
and
dragged
it
grating
and
complaining
back
a
push
then
opened
the
door
it
was
at
the
foot
of
a
short
flight
of
steps
they
ascended
and
at
the
top
curdie
found
himself
in
a
space
which
from
the
echo
to
his
stamp
appeared
of
some
size
though
of
what
sort
he
could
not
at
first
tell
for
his
hands
feeling
about
came
upon
nothing
presently
however
they
fell
on
a
great
thing
it
was
a
wine
cask
he
was
just
setting
out
to
explore
the
place
thoroughly
when
he
heard
steps
coming
down
a
stair
he
stood
still
not
knowing
whether
the
door
would
open
an
inch
from
his
nose
or
twenty
yards
behind
his
back
it
did
neither
he
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
a
stream
of
light
shot
in
ruining
the
darkness
about
fifteen
yards
away
on
his
right
a
man
carrying
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
a
large
silver
flagon
in
the
other
entered
and
came
toward
him
the
light
revealed
a
row
of
huge
wine
casks
that
stretched
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
other
end
of
the
long
vault
curdie
retreated
into
the
recess
of
the
stair
and
peeping
round
the
corner
of
it
watched
him
thinking
what
he
could
do
to
prevent
him
from
locking
them
in
he
came
on
and
on
until
curdie
feared
he
would
pass
the
recess
and
see
them
he
was
just
preparing
to
rush
out
and
master
him
before
he
should
give
alarm
not
in
the
least
knowing
what
he
should
do
next
when
to
his
relief
the
man
stopped
at
the
third
cask
from
where
he
stood
he
set
down
his
light
on
the
top
of
it
removed
what
seemed
a
large
and
poured
into
the
cask
a
quantity
of
something
from
the
flagon
then
he
turned
to
the
next
cask
drew
some
wine
rinsed
the
flagon
threw
the
wine
away
drew
and
rinsed
and
threw
away
again
then
drew
and
drank
draining
to
the
bottom
last
of
all
he
filled
the
flagon
from
the
cask
he
had
first
visited
replaced
then
the
took
up
his
candle
and
turned
toward
the
door
is
something
wrong
here
thought
curdie
to
him
lina
he
whispered
the
sudden
howl
she
gave
made
curdie
himself
start
and
tremble
for
a
moment
as
to
the
man
he
answered
lina
with
another
horrible
howl
forced
from
him
by
the
convulsive
shudder
of
every
muscle
of
his
body
then
reeled
gasping
to
and
fro
and
dropped
his
candle
but
just
as
curdie
expected
to
see
him
fall
dead
he
recovered
himself
and
flew
to
the
door
through
which
he
darted
leaving
it
open
behind
him
the
moment
he
ran
curdie
stepped
out
picked
up
the
candle
still
alight
sped
after
him
to
the
door
drew
out
the
key
and
then
returned
to
the
stair
and
waited
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
the
sound
of
many
feet
and
voices
instantly
he
turned
the
tap
of
the
cask
from
which
the
man
had
been
drinking
set
the
candle
beside
it
on
the
floor
went
down
the
steps
and
out
of
the
little
door
followed
by
lina
and
closed
it
behind
them
through
the
hole
in
it
he
could
see
a
little
and
hear
all
he
could
see
how
the
light
of
many
candles
filled
the
place
and
could
hear
how
some
two
dozen
feet
ran
hither
and
thither
through
the
echoing
cellar
he
could
hear
the
clash
of
iron
probably
spits
and
pokers
now
and
then
and
at
last
heard
how
finding
nothing
remarkable
except
the
best
wine
running
to
waste
they
all
turned
on
the
butler
and
accused
him
of
having
fooled
them
with
a
drunken
dream
he
did
his
best
to
defend
himself
appealing
to
the
evidence
of
their
own
senses
that
he
was
as
sober
as
they
were
they
replied
that
a
fright
was
no
less
a
fright
that
the
cause
was
imaginary
and
a
dream
no
less
a
dream
that
the
fright
had
waked
him
from
it
when
he
discovered
and
triumphantly
adduced
as
corroboration
that
the
key
was
gone
from
the
door
they
said
it
merely
showed
how
drunk
he
had
been
either
that
or
how
frightened
for
he
had
certainly
dropped
it
in
vain
he
protested
that
he
had
never
taken
it
out
of
the
lock
that
he
never
did
when
he
went
in
and
certainly
had
not
this
time
stopped
to
do
so
when
he
came
out
they
asked
him
why
he
had
to
go
to
the
cellar
at
such
a
time
of
the
day
and
said
it
was
because
he
had
already
drunk
all
the
wine
that
was
left
from
dinner
he
said
if
he
had
dropped
the
key
the
key
was
to
be
found
and
they
must
help
him
to
find
it
they
told
him
they
would
move
a
peg
for
him
he
declared
with
much
language
he
would
have
them
all
turned
out
of
the
service
they
said
they
would
swear
he
was
drunk
and
so
positive
were
they
about
it
that
at
last
the
butler
himself
began
to
think
whether
it
was
possible
they
could
be
in
the
right
for
he
knew
that
sometimes
when
he
had
been
drunk
he
fancied
things
had
taken
place
which
he
found
afterward
could
not
have
happened
certain
of
his
fellow
servants
however
had
all
the
time
a
doubt
whether
the
cellar
goblin
had
not
appeared
to
him
or
at
least
roared
at
him
to
protect
the
wine
in
any
case
nobody
wanted
to
find
the
key
for
him
nothing
could
please
them
better
than
that
the
door
of
the
wine
cellar
should
never
more
be
locked
by
degrees
the
hubbub
died
away
and
they
departed
not
even
pulling
to
the
door
for
there
was
neither
handle
nor
latch
to
it
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
curdie
returned
knowing
now
that
they
were
in
the
wine
cellar
of
the
palace
as
indeed
he
had
suspected
finding
a
pool
of
wine
in
a
hollow
of
the
floor
lina
lapped
it
up
eagerly
she
had
had
no
breakfast
and
was
now
very
thirsty
as
well
as
hungry
her
master
was
in
a
similar
plight
for
he
had
but
just
begun
to
eat
when
the
magistrate
arrived
with
the
soldiers
if
only
they
were
all
in
bed
he
thought
that
he
might
find
his
way
to
the
larder
for
he
said
to
himself
that
as
he
was
sent
there
by
the
young
to
serve
her
or
her
father
in
some
way
surely
he
must
have
a
right
to
his
food
in
the
palace
without
which
he
could
do
nothing
he
would
go
at
once
and
reconnoitre
so
he
crept
up
the
stair
that
led
from
the
cellar
at
the
top
was
a
door
opening
on
a
long
passage
dimly
lighted
by
a
lamp
he
told
lina
to
lie
down
upon
the
stair
while
he
went
on
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
found
a
door
ajar
and
peering
through
saw
right
into
a
great
stone
hall
where
a
huge
fire
was
blazing
and
through
which
men
in
the
king
livery
were
constantly
coming
and
going
some
also
in
the
same
livery
were
lounging
about
the
fire
he
noted
that
their
colours
were
the
same
as
those
he
himself
as
king
miner
wore
but
from
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
of
the
habits
of
the
place
he
could
not
hope
they
would
treat
him
the
better
for
that
the
one
interesting
thing
at
the
moment
however
was
the
plentiful
supper
with
which
the
table
was
spread
it
was
something
at
least
to
stand
in
sight
of
food
and
he
was
unwilling
to
turn
his
back
on
the
prospect
so
long
as
a
share
in
it
was
not
absolutely
hopeless
peeping
thus
he
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
if
at
any
moment
the
hall
should
be
empty
he
would
at
that
moment
rush
in
and
attempt
to
carry
off
a
dish
that
he
might
lose
no
time
by
indecision
he
selected
a
large
pie
upon
which
to
pounce
instantaneously
but
after
he
had
watched
for
some
minutes
it
did
not
seem
at
all
likely
the
chance
would
arrive
before
suppertime
and
he
was
just
about
to
turn
away
and
rejoin
lina
when
he
saw
that
there
was
not
a
person
in
the
place
curdie
never
made
up
his
mind
and
then
hesitated
he
darted
in
seized
the
pie
and
bore
it
swiftly
and
noiselessly
to
the
cellar
stair
chapter
the
king
kitchen
back
to
the
cellar
curdie
and
lina
sped
with
their
booty
where
seated
on
the
steps
curdie
lighted
his
bit
of
candle
for
a
moment
a
very
little
bit
it
was
now
but
they
did
not
waste
much
of
it
in
examination
of
the
pie
that
they
effected
by
a
more
summary
process
curdie
thought
it
the
nicest
food
he
had
ever
tasted
and
between
them
they
soon
ate
it
up
then
curdie
would
have
thrown
the
dish
along
with
the
bones
into
the
water
that
there
might
be
no
traces
of
them
but
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
hid
it
instead
and
the
very
next
minute
they
wanted
it
to
draw
some
wine
into
he
was
careful
it
should
be
from
the
cask
of
which
he
had
seen
the
butler
drink
then
they
sat
down
again
upon
the
steps
and
waited
until
the
house
should
be
quiet
for
he
was
there
to
do
something
and
if
it
did
not
come
to
him
in
the
cellar
he
must
go
to
meet
it
in
other
places
therefore
lest
he
should
fall
asleep
he
set
the
end
of
the
helve
of
his
mattock
on
the
ground
and
seated
himself
on
the
cross
part
leaning
against
the
wall
so
that
as
long
as
he
kept
awake
he
should
rest
but
the
moment
he
began
to
fall
asleep
he
must
fall
awake
instead
he
quite
expected
some
of
the
servants
would
visit
the
cellar
again
that
night
but
whether
it
was
that
they
were
afraid
of
each
other
or
believed
more
of
the
butler
story
than
they
had
chosen
to
allow
not
one
of
them
appeared
when
at
length
he
thought
he
might
venture
he
shouldered
his
mattock
and
crept
up
the
stair
the
lamp
was
out
in
the
passage
but
he
could
not
miss
his
way
to
the
servants
hall
trusting
to
lina
quickness
in
concealing
herself
he
took
her
with
him
when
they
reached
the
hall
they
found
it
quiet
and
nearly
dark
the
last
of
the
great
fire
was
glowing
red
but
giving
little
light
curdie
stood
and
warmed
himself
for
a
few
moments
miner
as
he
was
he
had
found
the
cellar
cold
to
sit
in
doing
nothing
and
standing
thus
he
thought
of
looking
if
there
were
any
bits
of
candle
about
there
were
many
candlesticks
on
the
supper
table
but
to
his
disappointment
and
indignation
their
candles
seemed
to
have
been
all
left
to
burn
out
and
some
of
them
indeed
he
found
still
hot
in
the
neck
presently
one
after
another
he
came
upon
seven
men
fast
asleep
most
of
them
upon
tables
one
in
a
chair
and
one
on
the
floor
they
seemed
from
their
shape
and
colour
to
have
eaten
and
drunk
so
much
that
they
might
be
burned
alive
without
wakening
he
grasped
the
hand
of
each
in
succession
and
found
two
ox
hoofs
three
pig
hoofs
one
concerning
which
he
could
not
be
sure
whether
it
was
the
hoof
of
a
donkey
or
a
pony
and
one
dog
paw
nice
set
of
people
to
be
about
a
king
thought
curdie
to
himself
and
turned
again
to
his
candle
hunt
he
did
at
last
find
two
or
three
little
pieces
and
stowed
them
away
in
his
pockets
they
now
left
the
hall
by
another
door
and
entered
a
short
passage
which
led
them
to
the
huge
kitchen
vaulted
and
black
with
smoke
there
too
the
fire
was
still
burning
so
that
he
was
able
to
see
a
little
of
the
state
of
things
in
this
quarter
also
the
place
was
dirty
and
disorderly
in
a
recess
on
a
heap
of
brushwood
lay
a
with
a
table
cover
around
her
and
a
skillet
in
her
hand
evidently
she
too
had
been
drinking
in
another
corner
lay
a
page
and
curdie
noted
how
like
his
dress
was
to
his
own
in
the
cinders
before
the
hearth
were
huddled
three
dogs
and
five
cats
all
fast
asleep
while
the
rats
were
running
about
the
floor
heart
ached
to
think
of
the
lovely
living
over
such
a
sty
the
mine
was
a
paradise
to
a
palace
with
such
servants
in
it
leaving
the
kitchen
he
got
into
the
region
of
the
sculleries
there
horrible
smells
were
wandering
about
like
evil
spirits
that
come
forth
with
the
darkness
he
lighted
a
candle
but
only
to
see
ugly
sights
everywhere
was
filth
and
disorder
mangy
turnspit
dogs
were
lying
about
and
grey
rats
were
gnawing
at
refuse
in
the
sinks
it
was
like
a
hideous
dream
he
felt
as
if
he
should
never
get
out
of
it
and
longed
for
one
glimpse
of
his
mother
poor
little
kitchen
so
clean
and
bright
and
airy
turning
from
it
at
last
in
miserable
disgust
he
almost
ran
back
through
the
kitchen
the
hall
and
crossed
it
to
another
door
it
opened
upon
a
wider
passage
leading
to
an
arch
in
a
stately
corridor
all
its
length
lighted
by
lamps
in
niches
at
the
end
of
it
was
a
large
and
beautiful
hall
with
great
pillars
there
sat
three
men
in
the
royal
livery
fast
asleep
each
in
a
great
armchair
with
his
feet
on
a
huge
footstool
they
looked
like
fools
dreaming
themselves
kings
and
lina
looked
as
if
she
longed
to
throttle
them
at
one
side
of
the
hall
was
the
grand
staircase
and
they
went
up
everything
that
now
met
curdie
eyes
was
rich
not
glorious
like
the
splendours
of
the
mountain
cavern
but
rich
and
soft
except
where
now
and
then
some
rough
old
rib
of
the
ancient
fortress
came
through
hard
and
discoloured
now
some
dark
bare
arch
of
stone
now
some
rugged
and
blackened
pillar
now
some
huge
beam
brown
with
the
smoke
and
dust
of
centuries
looked
like
a
thistle
in
the
midst
of
daisies
or
a
rock
in
a
smooth
lawn
they
wandered
about
a
good
while
again
and
again
finding
themselves
where
they
had
been
before
gradually
however
curdie
was
gaining
some
idea
of
the
place
by
and
by
lina
began
to
look
frightened
and
as
they
went
on
curdie
saw
that
she
looked
more
and
more
frightened
now
by
this
time
he
had
come
to
understand
that
what
made
her
look
frightened
was
always
the
fear
of
frightening
and
he
therefore
concluded
they
must
be
drawing
nigh
to
somebody
at
last
in
a
gorgeously
painted
gallery
he
saw
a
curtain
of
crimson
and
on
the
curtain
a
royal
crown
wrought
in
silks
and
stones
he
felt
sure
this
must
be
the
king
chamber
and
it
was
here
he
was
wanted
or
if
it
was
not
the
place
he
was
bound
for
something
would
meet
him
and
turn
him
aside
for
he
had
come
to
think
that
so
long
as
a
man
wants
to
do
right
he
may
go
where
he
can
when
he
can
go
no
farther
then
it
is
not
the
way
said
his
father
in
assenting
to
the
theory
must
really
want
to
do
right
and
not
merely
fancy
he
does
he
must
want
it
with
his
heart
and
will
and
not
with
his
rag
of
a
tongue
so
he
gently
lifted
the
corner
of
the
curtain
and
there
behind
it
was
a
door
he
entered
and
the
moment
he
was
in
lina
stretched
herself
along
the
threshold
between
the
curtain
and
the
door
chapter
the
king
chamber
he
found
himself
in
a
large
room
dimly
lighted
by
a
silver
lamp
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
far
at
the
other
end
was
a
great
bed
surrounded
with
dark
heavy
curtains
he
went
softly
toward
it
his
heart
beating
fast
it
was
a
dreadful
thing
to
be
alone
in
the
chamber
at
the
dead
of
night
to
gain
courage
he
had
to
remind
himself
of
the
beautiful
princess
who
had
sent
him
but
when
he
was
about
halfway
to
the
bed
a
figure
appeared
from
the
farther
side
of
it
and
came
towards
him
with
a
hand
raised
warningly
he
stood
still
the
light
was
dim
and
he
could
distinguish
little
more
than
the
outline
of
a
young
girl
but
though
the
form
he
saw
was
much
taller
than
the
princess
he
remembered
he
never
doubted
it
was
she
for
one
thing
he
knew
that
most
girls
would
have
been
frightened
to
see
him
there
in
the
dead
of
the
night
but
like
a
true
princess
and
the
princess
he
used
to
know
she
walked
straight
on
to
meet
him
as
she
came
she
lowered
the
hand
she
had
lifted
and
laid
the
forefinger
of
it
upon
her
lips
nearer
and
nearer
quite
near
close
up
to
him
she
came
then
stopped
and
stood
a
moment
looking
at
him
are
curdie
she
said
you
are
the
princess
irene
he
returned
we
know
each
other
still
she
said
with
a
sad
smile
of
pleasure
will
help
me
i
will
answered
curdie
he
did
not
say
i
can
for
he
knew
that
what
he
was
sent
to
do
that
he
could
do
i
kiss
your
hand
little
princess
she
was
only
between
nine
and
ten
though
indeed
she
looked
several
years
older
and
her
eyes
almost
those
of
a
grown
woman
for
she
had
had
terrible
trouble
of
late
she
held
out
her
hand
am
not
the
little
princess
any
more
i
have
grown
up
since
i
saw
you
last
mr
miner
the
smile
which
accompanied
the
words
had
in
it
a
strange
mixture
of
playfulness
and
sadness
i
see
miss
princess
returned
curdie
therefore
being
more
of
a
princess
you
are
the
more
my
princess

am
sent
by
your
to
be
your
servant

i
ask
why
you
are
up
so
late
princess
my
father
wakes
so
frightened
and
i
do
know
what
he
would
do
if
he
did
find
me
by
his
bedside
there
he
waking
now
she
darted
off
to
the
side
of
the
bed
she
had
come
from
curdie
stood
where
he
was
a
voice
altogether
unlike
what
he
remembered
of
the
mighty
noble
king
on
his
white
horse
came
from
the
bed
thin
feeble
hollow
and
husky
and
in
tone
like
that
of
a
petulant
child
will
not
i
will
not
i
am
a
king
and
i
will

a
king

crown
shall
never
have
your
crown
my
king
said
irene
it
is
all
safe
i
am
watching
it
for
you
curdie
drew
near
the
bed
on
the
other
side
there
lay
the
grand
old
king
he
looked
grand
still
and
twenty
years
older
his
body
was
pillowed
high
his
beard
descended
long
and
white
over
the
crimson
coverlid
and
his
crown
its
diamonds
and
emeralds
gleaming
in
the
twilight
of
the
curtains
lay
in
front
of
him
his
long
thin
old
hands
folded
round
it
and
the
ends
of
his
beard
straying
among
the
lovely
stones
his
face
was
like
that
of
a
man
who
had
died
fighting
nobly
but
one
thing
made
it
dreadful
his
eyes
while
they
moved
about
as
if
searching
in
this
direction
and
in
that
looked
more
dead
than
his
face
he
saw
neither
his
daughter
nor
his
crown
it
was
the
voice
of
the
one
and
the
touch
of
the
other
that
comforted
him
he
kept
murmuring
what
seemed
words
but
was
unintelligible
to
curdie
although
to
judge
from
the
look
of
irene
face
she
learned
and
concluded
from
it
by
degrees
his
voice
sank
away
and
the
murmuring
ceased
although
still
his
lips
moved
thus
lay
the
old
king
on
his
bed
slumbering
with
his
crown
between
his
hands
on
one
side
of
him
stood
a
lovely
little
maiden
with
blue
eyes
and
brown
hair
going
a
little
back
from
her
temples
as
if
blown
by
a
wind
that
no
one
felt
but
herself
and
on
the
other
a
stalwart
young
miner
with
his
mattock
over
his
shoulder
stranger
sight
still
was
lina
lying
along
the
threshold
only
nobody
saw
her
just
then
a
moment
more
and
the
king
lips
ceased
to
move
his
breathing
had
grown
regular
and
quiet
the
princess
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
came
round
to
curdie
can
talk
a
little
now
she
said
leading
him
toward
the
middle
of
the
room
father
will
sleep
now
till
the
doctor
wakes
him
to
give
him
his
medicine
it
is
not
really
medicine
though
but
wine
nothing
but
that
the
doctor
says
could
have
kept
him
so
long
alive
he
always
comes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
give
it
him
with
his
own
hands
but
it
makes
me
cry
to
see
him
wake
up
when
so
nicely
asleep
sort
of
man
is
your
doctor
asked
curdie
such
a
dear
good
kind
gentleman
replied
the
princess
speaks
so
softly
and
is
so
sorry
for
his
dear
king
he
will
be
here
presently
and
you
shall
see
for
yourself
you
will
like
him
very
much
your
been
long
ill
asked
curdie
whole
year
now
she
replied
you
not
know
that
how
your
mother
never
got
the
red
petticoat
my
father
promised
her
the
lord
chancellor
told
me
that
not
only
gwyntystorm
but
the
whole
land
was
mourning
over
the
illness
of
the
good
man
now
curdie
himself
had
not
heard
a
word
of
his
majesty
illness
and
had
no
ground
for
believing
that
a
single
soul
in
any
place
he
had
visited
on
his
journey
had
heard
of
it
moreover
although
mention
had
been
made
of
his
majesty
again
and
again
in
his
hearing
since
he
came
to
gwyntystorm
never
once
had
he
heard
an
allusion
to
the
state
of
his
health
and
now
it
dawned
upon
him
also
that
he
had
never
heard
the
least
expression
of
love
to
him
but
just
for
the
time
he
thought
it
better
to
say
nothing
on
either
point
the
king
wander
like
this
every
night
he
asked
night
answered
irene
shaking
her
head
mournfully
is
why
i
never
go
to
bed
at
night
he
is
better
during
the
day
a
little
and
then
i
sleep
in
the
dressing
room
there
to
be
with
him
in
a
moment
if
he
should
call
me
it
is
so
sad
he
should
have
only
me
and
not
my
mamma
a
princess
is
nothing
to
a
queen
wish
he
would
like
me
said
curdie
then
i
might
watch
by
him
at
night
and
let
you
go
to
bed
princess
you
know
then
returned
irene
in
wonder
was
it
you
came
ah
you
said
my
grandmother
sent
you
but
i
thought
you
knew
that
he
wanted
you
and
again
she
opened
wide
her
blue
stars
i
said
curdie
also
bewildered
but
very
glad
used
to
be
constantly
saying
he
was
not
so
ill
then
as
he
is
now
that
he
wished
he
had
you
about
him
i
never
to
know
it
said
curdie
with
displeasure
master
of
the
horse
told
papa
own
secretary
that
he
had
written
to
the
to
find
you
and
send
you
up
but
the
wrote
back
to
the
master
of
the
horse
and
he
told
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
told
my
father
that
they
had
searched
every
mine
in
the
kingdom
and
could
hear
nothing
of
you
my
father
gave
a
great
sigh
and
said
he
feared
the
goblins
had
got
you
after
all
and
your
father
and
mother
were
dead
of
grief
and
he
has
never
mentioned
you
since
except
when
wandering
i
cried
very
much
but
one
of
my
pigeons
with
its
white
wing
flashed
a
message
to
me
through
the
window
one
day
and
then
i
knew
that
my
curdie
was
eaten
by
the
goblins
for
my
grandmother
would
have
taken
care
of
him
one
time
to
let
him
be
eaten
the
next
where
were
you
curdie
that
they
could
find
you
will
talk
about
that
another
time
when
we
are
not
expecting
the
doctor
said
curdie
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
fell
upon
something
shining
on
the
table
under
the
lamp
his
heart
gave
a
great
throb
and
he
went
nearer
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
was
the
same
flagon
that
the
butler
had
filled
in
the
wine
cellar
looks
worse
and
worse
said
to
himself
and
went
back
to
irene
where
she
stood
half
dreaming
will
the
doctor
be
here
he
asked
once
more
this
time
hurriedly
the
question
was
answered
not
by
the
princess
but
by
something
which
that
instant
tumbled
heavily
into
the
room
curdie
flew
toward
it
in
vague
terror
about
lina
on
the
floor
lay
a
little
round
man
puffing
and
blowing
and
uttering
incoherent
language
curdie
thought
of
his
mattock
and
ran
and
laid
it
aside
dear
dr
kelman
cried
the
princess
running
up
and
taking
hold
of
his
arm
am
so
sorry
she
pulled
and
pulled
but
might
almost
as
well
have
tried
to
set
up
a
cannon
ball
hope
you
have
not
hurt
yourself
at
all
not
at
all
said
the
doctor
trying
to
smile
and
to
rise
both
at
once
but
finding
it
impossible
to
do
either
he
slept
on
the
floor
he
would
be
late
for
breakfast
said
curdie
to
himself
and
held
out
his
hand
to
help
him
but
when
he
took
hold
of
it
curdie
very
nearly
let
him
fall
again
for
what
he
held
was
not
even
a
foot
it
was
the
belly
of
a
creeping
thing
he
managed
however
to
hold
both
his
peace
and
his
grasp
and
pulled
the
doctor
roughly
on
his
legs
such
as
they
were
royal
highness
has
rather
a
thick
mat
at
the
door
said
the
doctor
patting
his
palms
together
hope
my
awkwardness
may
not
have
startled
his
majesty
while
he
talked
curdie
went
to
the
door
lina
was
not
there
the
doctor
approached
the
bed
how
has
my
beloved
king
slept
tonight
he
asked
better
answered
irene
with
a
mournful
shake
of
her
head
that
is
very
well
returned
the
doctor
his
fall
seeming
to
have
muddled
either
his
words
or
his
meaning
we
give
him
his
wine
he
will
be
better
still
curdie
darted
at
the
flagon
and
lifted
it
high
as
if
he
had
expected
to
find
it
full
but
had
found
it
empty
stupid
butler
i
heard
them
say
he
was
drunk
he
cried
in
a
loud
whisper
and
was
gliding
from
the
room
here
with
that
flagon
you
page
cried
the
doctor
curdie
came
a
few
steps
toward
him
with
the
flagon
dangling
from
his
hand
heedless
of
the
gushes
that
fell
noiseless
on
the
thick
carpet
you
aware
young
man
said
the
doctor
it
is
not
every
wine
can
do
his
majesty
the
benefit
i
intend
he
should
derive
from
my
prescription
aware
sir
answered
curdie
wine
for
his
majesty
use
is
in
the
third
cask
from
the
corner
then
said
the
doctor
looking
satisfied
curdie
stopped
outside
the
curtain
and
blew
an
audible
breath
no
more
up
came
lina
noiseless
as
a
shadow
he
showed
her
the
flagon
cellar
lina
go
he
said
she
galloped
away
on
her
soft
feet
and
curdie
had
indeed
to
fly
to
keep
up
with
her
not
once
did
she
make
even
a
dubious
turn
from
the
king
gorgeous
chamber
to
the
cold
cellar
they
shot
curdie
dashed
the
wine
down
the
back
stair
rinsed
the
flagon
out
as
he
had
seen
the
butler
do
filled
it
from
the
cask
of
which
he
had
seen
the
butler
drink
and
hastened
with
it
up
again
to
the
king
room
the
little
doctor
took
it
poured
out
a
full
glass
smelt
but
did
not
taste
it
and
set
it
down
then
he
leaned
over
the
bed
shouted
in
the
king
ear
blew
upon
his
eyes
and
pinched
his
arm
curdie
thought
he
saw
him
run
something
bright
into
it
at
last
the
king
half
woke
the
doctor
seized
the
glass
raised
his
head
poured
the
wine
down
his
throat
and
let
his
head
fall
back
on
the
pillow
again
tenderly
wiping
his
beard
and
bidding
the
princess
good
night
in
paternal
tones
he
then
took
his
leave
curdie
would
gladly
have
driven
his
pick
into
his
head
but
that
was
not
in
his
commission
and
he
let
him
go
the
little
round
man
looked
very
carefully
to
his
feet
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
attentive
fellow
of
a
page
has
removed
the
mat
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
along
the
corridor
must
remember
him
chapter
counterplotting
curdie
was
already
sufficiently
enlightened
as
to
how
things
were
going
to
see
that
he
must
have
the
princess
of
one
mind
with
him
and
they
must
work
together
it
was
clear
that
among
those
about
the
king
there
was
a
plot
against
him
for
one
thing
they
had
agreed
in
a
lie
concerning
himself
and
it
was
plain
also
that
the
doctor
was
working
out
a
design
against
the
health
and
reason
of
his
majesty
rendering
the
question
of
his
life
a
matter
of
little
moment
it
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
justify
the
worst
fears
that
the
people
outside
the
palace
were
ignorant
of
his
majesty
condition
he
believed
those
inside
it
also
the
butler
excepted
were
ignorant
of
it
as
well
doubtless
his
majesty
councillors
desired
to
alienate
the
hearts
of
his
subjects
from
their
sovereign
curdie
idea
was
that
they
intended
to
kill
the
king
marry
the
princess
to
one
of
themselves
and
found
a
new
dynasty
but
whatever
their
purpose
there
was
treason
in
the
palace
of
the
worst
sort
they
were
making
and
keeping
the
king
incapable
in
order
to
effect
that
purpose
the
first
thing
to
be
seen
to
therefore
was
that
his
majesty
should
neither
eat
morsel
nor
drink
drop
of
anything
prepared
for
him
in
the
palace
could
this
have
been
managed
without
the
princess
curdie
would
have
preferred
leaving
her
in
ignorance
of
the
horrors
from
which
he
sought
to
deliver
her
he
feared
also
the
danger
of
her
knowledge
betraying
itself
to
the
evil
eyes
about
her
but
it
must
be
risked
and
she
had
always
been
a
wise
child
another
thing
was
clear
to
him
that
with
such
traitors
no
terms
of
honour
were
either
binding
or
possible
and
that
short
of
lying
he
might
use
any
means
to
foil
them
and
he
could
not
doubt
that
the
old
princess
had
sent
him
expressly
to
frustrate
their
plans
while
he
stood
thinking
thus
with
himself
the
princess
was
earnestly
watching
the
king
with
looks
of
childish
love
and
womanly
tenderness
that
went
to
curdie
heart
now
and
then
with
a
great
fan
of
peacock
feathers
she
would
fan
him
very
softly
now
and
then
seeing
a
cloud
begin
to
gather
upon
the
sky
of
his
sleeping
face
she
would
climb
upon
the
bed
and
bending
to
his
ear
whisper
into
it
then
draw
back
and
watch
again
generally
to
see
the
cloud
disperse
in
his
deepest
slumber
the
soul
of
the
king
lay
open
to
the
voice
of
his
child
and
that
voice
had
power
either
to
change
the
aspect
of
his
visions
or
which
was
better
still
to
breathe
hope
into
his
heart
and
courage
to
endure
them
curdie
came
near
and
softly
called
her
ca
leave
papa
just
yet
she
returned
in
a
low
voice
will
wait
said
curdie
i
want
very
much
to
say
something
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
to
him
where
he
stood
under
the
lamp
curdie
what
is
it
she
said
he
replied
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
found
why
your
grandmother
sent
me
this
way
then
she
answered
i
can
see
the
face
of
my
king
curdie
placed
a
chair
for
her
in
the
spot
she
chose
where
she
would
be
near
enough
to
mark
any
slightest
change
on
her
father
countenance
yet
where
their
talk
would
not
disturb
him
there
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
all
the
story
how
her
grandmother
had
sent
her
good
pigeon
for
him
and
how
she
had
instructed
him
and
sent
him
there
without
telling
him
what
he
had
to
do
then
he
told
her
what
he
had
discovered
of
the
state
of
things
generally
in
gwyntystorm
and
especially
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
in
the
palace
that
night
are
in
a
bad
state
enough
he
said
in
conclusion
and
selfishness
and
inhospitality
and
dishonesty
everywhere
and
to
crown
all
they
speak
with
disrespect
of
the
good
king
and
not
a
man
knows
he
is
frighten
me
dreadfully
said
irene
trembling
must
be
brave
for
your
king
sake
said
curdie
i
will
she
replied
and
turned
a
long
loving
look
upon
the
beautiful
face
of
her
father
what
is
to
be
done
and
how
am
i
to
believe
such
horrible
things
of
dr
kelman
dear
princess
replied
curdie
know
nothing
of
him
but
his
face
and
his
tongue
and
they
are
both
false
either
you
must
beware
of
him
or
you
must
doubt
your
grandmother
and
me
for
i
tell
you
by
the
gift
she
gave
me
of
testing
hands
that
this
man
is
a
snake
that
round
body
he
shows
is
but
the
case
of
a
serpent
perhaps
the
creature
lies
there
as
in
its
nest
coiled
round
and
round
inside
said
irene
indeed
but
we
must
not
try
to
get
rid
of
horrible
things
by
refusing
to
look
at
them
and
saying
they
are
not
there
is
not
your
beautiful
father
sleeping
better
since
he
had
the
wine
he
always
sleep
better
after
having
it
she
reflected
an
instant
always
worse
till
tonight
she
answered
remember
that
was
the
wine
i
got
him
not
what
the
butler
drew
nothing
that
passes
through
any
hand
in
the
house
except
yours
or
mine
must
henceforth
till
he
is
well
reach
his
majesty
lips
how
dear
curdie
said
the
princess
almost
crying
we
must
contrive
answered
curdie
know
how
to
take
care
of
the
wine
but
for
his
food
now
we
must
think
takes
hardly
any
said
the
princess
with
a
pathetic
shake
of
her
little
head
which
curdie
had
almost
learned
to
look
for
more
need
he
replied
should
be
no
poison
in
it
irene
shuddered
soon
as
he
has
honest
food
he
will
begin
to
grow
better
and
you
must
be
just
as
careful
with
yourself
princess
curdie
went
on
you
do
know
when
they
may
begin
to
poison
you
too
no
fear
of
me
do
talk
about
me
said
irene
good
food
how
are
we
to
get
it
curdie
that
is
the
whole
question
am
thinking
hard
answered
curdie
good
food
let
me
see
let
me
see
such
servants
as
i
saw
below
are
sure
to
have
the
best
of
everything
for
themselves
i
will
go
an
see
what
i
can
find
on
their
table
chancellor
sleeps
in
the
house
and
he
and
the
master
of
the
king
horse
always
have
their
supper
together
in
a
room
off
the
great
hall
to
the
right
as
you
go
down
the
stairs
said
irene
would
go
with
you
but
i
dare
not
leave
my
father
alas
he
scarcely
ever
takes
more
than
a
mouthful
i
ca
think
how
he
lives
and
the
very
thing
he
would
like
and
often
asks
for
a
bit
of
bread
i
can
hardly
ever
get
for
him
dr
kelman
has
forbidden
it
and
says
it
is
nothing
less
than
poison
to
him
at
least
he
shall
have
said
curdie
that
with
the
honest
wine
will
do
as
well
as
anything
i
do
believe
i
will
go
at
once
and
look
for
some
but
i
want
you
to
see
lina
first
and
know
her
lest
coming
upon
her
by
accident
at
any
time
you
should
be
frightened
should
like
much
to
see
her
said
the
princess
warning
her
not
to
be
startled
by
her
ugliness
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
her
she
entered
creeping
with
downcast
head
and
dragging
her
tail
over
the
floor
behind
her
curdie
watched
the
princess
as
the
frightful
creature
came
nearer
and
nearer
one
shudder
went
from
head
to
foot
and
next
instant
she
stepped
to
meet
her
lina
dropped
flat
on
the
floor
and
covered
her
face
with
her
two
big
paws
it
went
to
the
heart
of
the
princess
in
a
moment
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
her
stroking
her
ugly
head
and
patting
her
all
over
dog
dear
ugly
dog
she
said
lina
whimpered
believe
said
curdie
what
your
grandmother
told
me
that
lina
is
a
woman
and
that
she
was
naughty
but
is
now
growing
good
lina
had
lifted
her
head
while
irene
was
caressing
her
now
she
dropped
it
again
between
her
paws
but
the
princess
took
it
in
her
hands
and
kissed
the
forehead
betwixt
the
eyes
i
take
her
with
me
or
leave
her
asked
curdie
her
poor
dear
said
irene
and
curdie
knowing
the
way
now
went
without
her
he
took
his
way
first
to
the
room
the
princess
had
spoken
of
and
there
also
were
the
remains
of
supper
but
neither
there
nor
in
the
kitchen
could
he
find
a
scrap
of
plain
bread
so
he
returned
and
told
her
that
as
soon
as
it
was
light
he
would
go
into
the
city
for
some
and
asked
her
for
a
handkerchief
to
tie
it
in
if
he
could
not
bring
it
himself
he
would
send
it
by
lina
who
could
keep
out
of
sight
better
than
he
and
as
soon
as
all
was
quiet
at
night
he
would
come
to
her
again
he
also
asked
her
to
tell
the
king
that
he
was
in
the
house
his
hope
lay
in
the
fact
that
bakers
everywhere
go
to
work
early
but
it
was
yet
much
too
early
so
he
persuaded
the
princess
to
lie
down
promising
to
call
her
if
the
king
should
stir
chapter
the
loaf
his
majesty
slept
very
quietly
the
dawn
had
grown
almost
day
and
still
curdie
lingered
unwilling
to
disturb
the
princess
at
last
however
he
called
her
and
she
was
in
the
room
in
a
moment
she
had
slept
she
said
and
felt
quite
fresh
delighted
to
find
her
father
still
asleep
and
so
peacefully
she
pushed
her
chair
close
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
curdie
got
his
mattock
from
where
he
had
hidden
it
behind
a
great
mirror
and
went
to
the
cellar
followed
by
lina
they
took
some
breakfast
with
them
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
and
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
it
went
out
the
back
way
at
the
mouth
of
the
passage
curdie
seized
the
rope
drew
himself
up
pushed
away
the
shutter
and
entered
the
dungeon
then
he
swung
the
end
of
the
rope
to
lina
and
she
caught
it
in
her
teeth
when
her
master
said
lina
she
gave
a
great
spring
and
he
ran
away
with
the
end
of
the
rope
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
and
such
a
spring
had
she
made
that
by
the
time
he
had
to
bear
her
weight
she
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
hole
the
instant
she
got
a
paw
through
she
was
all
through
apparently
their
enemies
were
waiting
till
hunger
should
have
cowed
them
for
there
was
no
sign
of
any
attempt
having
been
made
to
open
the
door
a
blow
or
two
of
curdie
mattock
drove
the
shattered
lock
clean
from
it
and
telling
lina
to
wait
there
till
he
came
back
and
let
no
one
in
he
walked
out
into
the
silent
street
and
drew
the
door
to
behind
them
he
could
hardly
believe
it
was
not
yet
a
whole
day
since
he
had
been
thrown
in
there
with
his
hands
tied
at
his
back
down
the
town
he
went
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
street
that
if
any
one
saw
him
he
might
see
he
was
not
afraid
and
hesitate
to
rouse
an
attack
on
him
as
to
the
dogs
ever
since
the
death
of
their
two
companions
a
shadow
that
looked
like
a
mattock
was
enough
to
make
them
scamper
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
archway
of
the
city
gate
he
turned
to
reconnoitre
the
baker
shop
and
perceiving
no
sign
of
movement
waited
there
watching
for
the
first
after
about
an
hour
the
door
opened
and
the
baker
man
appeared
with
a
pail
in
his
hand
he
went
to
a
pump
that
stood
in
the
street
and
having
filled
his
pail
returned
with
it
into
the
shop
curdie
stole
after
him
found
the
door
on
the
latch
opened
it
very
gently
peeped
in
saw
nobody
and
entered
remembering
perfectly
from
what
shelf
the
baker
wife
had
taken
the
loaf
she
said
was
the
best
and
seeing
just
one
upon
it
he
seized
it
laid
the
price
of
it
on
the
counter
and
sped
softly
out
and
up
the
street
once
more
in
the
dungeon
beside
lina
his
first
thought
was
to
fasten
up
the
door
again
which
would
have
been
easy
so
many
iron
fragments
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
lay
about
but
he
bethought
himself
that
if
he
left
it
as
it
was
and
they
came
to
find
him
they
would
conclude
at
once
that
they
had
made
their
escape
by
it
and
would
look
no
farther
so
as
to
discover
the
hole
he
therefore
merely
pushed
the
door
close
and
left
it
then
once
more
carefully
arranging
the
earth
behind
the
shutter
so
that
it
should
again
fall
with
it
he
returned
to
the
cellar
and
now
he
had
to
convey
the
loaf
to
the
princess
if
he
could
venture
to
take
it
himself
well
if
not
he
would
send
lina
he
crept
to
the
door
of
the
servants
hall
and
found
the
sleepers
beginning
to
stir
one
said
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
another
that
he
would
go
to
the
cellar
instead
and
have
a
mug
of
wine
to
waken
him
up
while
a
third
challenged
a
fourth
to
give
him
his
revenge
at
some
game
or
other
hang
your
losses
answered
his
companion
soon
pick
up
twice
as
much
about
the
house
if
you
but
keep
your
eyes
open
perceiving
there
would
be
risk
in
attempting
to
pass
through
and
reflecting
that
the
porters
in
the
great
hall
would
probably
be
awake
also
curdie
went
back
to
the
cellar
took
irene
handkerchief
with
the
loaf
in
it
tied
it
round
lina
neck
and
told
her
to
take
it
to
the
princess
using
every
shadow
and
every
shelter
lina
slid
through
the
servants
like
a
shapeless
terror
through
a
guilty
mind
and
so
by
corridor
and
great
hall
up
the
stair
to
the
king
chamber
irene
trembled
a
little
when
she
saw
her
glide
soundless
in
across
the
silent
dusk
of
the
morning
that
filtered
through
the
heavy
drapery
of
the
windows
but
she
recovered
herself
at
once
when
she
saw
the
bundle
about
her
neck
for
it
both
assured
her
of
curdie
safety
and
gave
her
hope
of
her
father
she
untied
it
with
joy
and
lina
stole
away
silent
as
she
had
come
her
joy
was
the
greater
that
the
king
had
waked
up
a
little
before
and
expressed
a
desire
for
food
not
that
he
felt
exactly
hungry
he
said
and
yet
he
wanted
something
if
only
he
might
have
a
piece
of
nice
fresh
bread
irene
had
no
knife
but
with
eager
hands
she
broke
a
great
piece
from
the
loaf
and
poured
out
a
full
glass
of
wine
the
king
ate
and
drank
enjoyed
the
bread
and
the
wine
much
and
instantly
fell
asleep
again
it
was
hours
before
the
lazy
people
brought
their
breakfast
when
it
came
irene
crumbled
a
little
about
threw
some
into
the
fireplace
and
managed
to
make
the
tray
look
just
as
usual
in
the
meantime
down
below
in
the
cellar
curdie
was
lying
in
the
hollow
between
the
upper
sides
of
two
of
the
great
casks
the
warmest
place
he
could
find
lina
was
watching
she
lay
at
his
feet
across
the
two
casks
and
did
her
best
so
to
arrange
her
huge
tail
that
it
should
be
a
warm
coverlid
for
her
master
by
and
by
dr
kelman
called
to
see
his
patient
and
now
that
eyes
were
opened
she
saw
clearly
enough
that
he
was
both
annoyed
and
puzzled
at
finding
his
majesty
rather
better
he
pretended
however
to
congratulate
him
saying
he
believed
he
was
quite
fit
to
see
the
lord
chamberlain
he
wanted
his
signature
to
something
important
only
he
must
not
strain
his
mind
to
understand
it
whatever
it
might
be
if
his
majesty
did
he
would
not
be
answerable
for
the
consequences
the
king
said
he
would
see
the
lord
chamberlain
and
the
doctor
went
then
irene
gave
him
more
bread
and
wine
and
the
king
ate
and
drank
and
smiled
a
feeble
smile
the
first
real
one
she
had
seen
for
many
a
day
he
said
he
felt
much
better
and
would
soon
be
able
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
again
he
had
a
strange
miserable
feeling
he
said
that
things
were
going
terribly
wrong
although
he
could
not
tell
how
then
the
princess
told
him
that
curdie
had
come
and
that
at
night
when
all
was
quiet
for
nobody
in
the
palace
must
know
he
would
pay
his
majesty
a
visit
her
had
sent
him
she
said
the
king
looked
strangely
upon
her
but
the
strange
look
passed
into
a
smile
clearer
than
the
first
and
irene
heart
throbbed
with
delight
chapter
the
lord
chamberlain
at
noon
the
lord
chamberlain
appeared
with
a
long
low
bow
and
paper
in
hand
he
stepped
softly
into
the
room
greeting
his
majesty
with
every
appearance
of
the
profoundest
respect
and
congratulating
him
on
the
evident
progress
he
had
made
he
declared
himself
sorry
to
trouble
him
but
there
were
certain
papers
he
said
which
required
his
signature
and
therewith
drew
nearer
to
the
king
who
lay
looking
at
him
doubtfully
he
was
a
lean
long
yellow
man
with
a
small
head
bald
over
the
top
and
tufted
at
the
back
and
about
the
ears
he
had
a
very
thin
prominent
hooked
nose
and
a
quantity
of
loose
skin
under
his
chin
and
about
the
throat
which
came
craning
up
out
of
his
neckcloth
his
eyes
were
very
small
sharp
and
glittering
and
looked
black
as
jet
he
had
hardly
enough
of
a
mouth
to
make
a
smile
with
his
left
hand
held
the
paper
and
the
long
skinny
fingers
of
his
right
a
pen
just
dipped
in
ink
but
the
king
who
for
weeks
had
scarcely
known
what
he
did
was
today
so
much
himself
as
to
be
aware
that
he
was
not
quite
himself
and
the
moment
he
saw
the
paper
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
sign
without
understanding
and
approving
of
it
he
requested
the
lord
chamberlain
therefore
to
read
it
his
lordship
commenced
at
once
but
the
difficulties
he
seemed
to
encounter
and
the
fits
of
stammering
that
seized
him
roused
the
king
suspicion
tenfold
he
called
the
princess
trouble
his
lordship
too
much
he
said
to
her
can
read
print
well
my
child
let
me
hear
how
you
can
read
writing
take
that
paper
from
his
lordship
hand
and
read
it
to
me
from
beginning
to
end
while
my
lord
drinks
a
glass
of
my
favourite
wine
and
watches
for
your
blunders
me
your
majesty
said
the
lord
chamberlain
with
as
much
of
a
smile
as
he
was
able
to
extemporize
it
were
a
thousand
pities
to
put
the
attainments
of
her
royal
highness
to
a
test
altogether
too
severe
your
majesty
can
scarcely
with
justice
expect
the
very
organs
of
her
speech
to
prove
capable
of
compassing
words
so
long
and
to
her
so
unintelligible
think
much
of
my
little
princess
and
her
capabilities
returned
the
king
more
and
more
aroused
my
lord
permit
her
to
try
your
majesty
the
thing
would
be
altogether
without
precedent
it
would
be
to
make
sport
of
statecraft
said
the
lord
chamberlain
you
are
right
my
lord
answered
the
king
with
more
meaning
than
he
intended
should
be
manifest
while
to
his
growing
joy
he
felt
new
life
and
power
throbbing
in
heart
and
brain
this
morning
we
shall
read
no
further
i
am
indeed
ill
able
for
business
of
such
weight
your
majesty
please
sign
your
royal
name
here
said
the
lord
chamberlain
preferring
the
request
as
a
matter
of
course
and
approaching
with
the
feather
end
of
the
pen
pointed
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
great
red
seal
today
my
lord
replied
the
king
is
of
the
greatest
importance
your
majesty
softly
insisted
the
other
descried
no
such
importance
in
it
said
the
king
majesty
heard
but
a
part
i
can
hear
no
more
today
trust
your
majesty
has
ground
enough
in
a
case
of
necessity
like
the
present
to
sign
upon
the
representation
of
his
loyal
subject
and
chamberlain
or
shall
i
call
the
lord
chancellor
he
added
rising
is
no
need
i
have
the
very
highest
opinion
of
your
judgement
my
lord
answered
the
king
is
with
respect
to
means
we
might
differ
as
to
ends
the
lord
chamberlain
made
yet
further
attempts
at
persuasion
but
they
grew
feebler
and
feebler
and
he
was
at
last
compelled
to
retire
without
having
gained
his
object
and
well
might
his
annoyance
be
keen
for
that
paper
was
the
king
will
drawn
up
by
the
nor
until
they
had
the
king
signature
to
it
was
there
much
use
in
venturing
farther
but
his
worst
sense
of
discomfiture
arose
from
finding
the
king
with
so
much
capacity
left
for
the
doctor
had
pledged
himself
so
to
weaken
his
brain
that
he
should
be
as
a
child
in
their
hands
incapable
of
refusing
anything
requested
of
him
his
lordship
began
to
doubt
the
doctor
fidelity
to
the
conspiracy
the
princess
was
in
high
delight
she
had
not
for
weeks
heard
so
many
words
not
to
say
words
of
such
strength
and
reason
from
her
lips
day
by
day
he
had
been
growing
weaker
and
more
lethargic
he
was
so
much
exhausted
however
after
this
effort
that
he
asked
for
another
piece
of
bread
and
more
wine
and
fell
fast
asleep
the
moment
he
had
taken
them
the
lord
chamberlain
sent
in
a
rage
for
dr
kelman
he
came
and
while
professing
himself
unable
to
understand
the
symptoms
described
by
his
lordship
yet
pledged
himself
again
that
on
the
morrow
the
king
should
do
whatever
was
required
of
him
the
day
went
on
when
his
majesty
was
awake
the
princess
read
to
him
one
storybook
after
another
and
whatever
she
read
the
king
listened
as
if
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
good
before
making
out
in
it
the
wisest
meanings
every
now
and
then
he
asked
for
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
little
wine
and
every
time
he
ate
and
drank
he
slept
and
every
time
he
woke
he
seemed
better
than
the
last
time
the
princess
bearing
her
part
the
loaf
was
eaten
up
and
the
flagon
emptied
before
night
the
butler
took
the
flagon
away
and
brought
it
back
filled
to
the
brim
but
both
were
thirsty
and
hungry
when
curdie
came
again
meantime
he
and
lina
watching
and
waking
alternately
had
plenty
of
sleep
in
the
afternoon
peeping
from
the
recess
they
saw
several
of
the
servants
enter
hurriedly
one
after
the
other
draw
wine
drink
it
and
steal
out
but
their
business
was
to
take
care
of
the
king
not
of
his
cellar
and
they
let
them
drink
also
when
the
butler
came
to
fill
the
flagon
they
restrained
themselves
for
the
villain
fate
was
not
yet
ready
for
him
he
looked
terribly
frightened
and
had
brought
with
him
a
large
candle
and
a
small
terrier
which
latter
indeed
threatened
to
be
troublesome
for
he
went
roving
and
sniffing
about
until
he
came
to
the
recess
where
they
were
but
as
soon
as
he
showed
himself
lina
opened
her
jaws
so
wide
and
glared
at
him
so
horribly
that
without
even
uttering
a
whimper
he
tucked
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
ran
to
his
master
he
was
drawing
the
wicked
wine
at
the
moment
and
did
not
see
him
else
he
would
doubtless
have
run
too
when
suppertime
approached
curdie
took
his
place
at
the
door
into
the
servants
hall
but
after
a
long
hour
vain
watch
he
began
to
fear
he
should
get
nothing
there
was
so
much
idling
about
as
well
as
coming
and
going
it
was
hard
to
bear
chiefly
from
the
attractions
of
a
splendid
loaf
just
fresh
out
of
the
oven
which
he
longed
to
secure
for
the
king
and
princess
at
length
his
chance
did
arrive
he
pounced
upon
the
loaf
and
carried
it
away
and
soon
after
got
hold
of
a
pie
this
time
however
both
loaf
and
pie
were
missed
the
cook
was
called
he
declared
he
had
provided
both
one
of
themselves
he
said
must
have
carried
them
away
for
some
friend
outside
the
palace
then
a
housemaid
who
had
not
long
been
one
of
them
said
she
had
seen
someone
like
a
page
running
in
the
direction
of
the
cellar
with
something
in
his
hands
instantly
all
turned
upon
the
pages
accusing
them
one
after
another
all
denied
but
nobody
believed
one
of
them
where
there
is
no
truth
there
can
be
no
faith
to
the
cellar
they
all
set
out
to
look
for
the
missing
pie
and
loaf
lina
heard
them
coming
as
well
she
might
for
they
were
talking
and
quarrelling
loud
and
gave
her
master
warning
they
snatched
up
everything
and
got
all
signs
of
their
presence
out
at
the
back
door
before
the
servants
entered
when
they
found
nothing
they
all
turned
on
the
chambermaid
and
accused
her
not
only
of
lying
against
the
pages
but
of
having
taken
the
things
herself
their
language
and
behaviour
so
disgusted
curdie
who
could
hear
a
great
part
of
what
passed
and
he
saw
the
danger
of
discovery
now
so
much
increased
that
he
began
to
devise
how
best
at
once
to
rid
the
palace
of
the
whole
pack
of
them
that
however
would
be
small
gain
so
long
as
the
treacherous
officers
of
state
continued
in
it
they
must
be
first
dealt
with
a
thought
came
to
him
and
the
longer
he
looked
at
it
the
better
he
liked
it
as
soon
as
the
servants
were
gone
quarrelling
and
accusing
all
the
way
they
returned
and
finished
their
supper
then
curdie
who
had
long
been
satisfied
that
lina
understood
almost
every
word
he
said
communicated
his
plan
to
her
and
knew
by
the
wagging
of
her
tail
and
the
flashing
of
her
eyes
that
she
comprehended
it
until
they
had
the
king
safe
through
the
worst
part
of
the
night
however
nothing
could
be
done
they
had
now
merely
to
go
on
waiting
where
they
were
till
the
household
should
be
asleep
this
waiting
and
waiting
was
much
the
hardest
thing
curdie
had
to
do
in
the
whole
affair
he
took
his
mattock
and
going
again
into
the
long
passage
lighted
a
candle
end
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
rock
on
all
sides
but
this
was
not
merely
to
pass
the
time
he
had
a
reason
for
it
when
he
broke
the
stone
in
the
street
over
which
the
baker
fell
its
appearance
led
him
to
pocket
a
fragment
for
further
examination
and
since
then
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
the
kind
of
stone
in
which
gold
is
found
and
that
the
yellow
particles
in
it
were
pure
metal
if
such
stone
existed
here
in
any
plenty
he
could
soon
make
the
king
rich
and
independent
of
his
subjects
he
was
therefore
now
bent
on
an
examination
of
the
rock
nor
had
he
been
at
it
long
before
he
was
persuaded
that
there
were
large
quantities
of
gold
in
the
white
stone
with
its
veins
of
opaque
white
and
of
green
of
which
the
rock
so
far
as
he
had
been
able
to
inspect
it
seemed
almost
entirely
to
consist
every
piece
he
broke
was
spotted
with
particles
and
little
lumps
of
a
lovely
greenish
yellow
and
that
was
gold
hitherto
he
had
worked
only
in
silver
but
he
had
read
and
heard
talk
and
knew
therefore
about
gold
as
soon
as
he
had
got
the
king
free
of
rogues
and
villains
he
would
have
all
the
best
and
most
honest
miners
with
his
father
at
the
head
of
them
to
work
this
rock
for
the
king
it
was
a
great
delight
to
him
to
use
his
mattock
once
more
the
time
went
quickly
and
when
he
left
the
passage
to
go
to
the
king
chamber
he
had
already
a
good
heap
of
fragments
behind
the
broken
door
chapter
dr
kelman
as
soon
as
he
had
reason
to
hope
the
way
was
clear
curdie
ventured
softly
into
the
hall
with
lina
behind
him
there
was
no
one
asleep
on
the
bench
or
floor
but
by
the
fading
fire
sat
a
girl
weeping
it
was
the
same
who
had
seen
him
carrying
off
the
food
and
had
been
so
hardly
used
for
saying
so
she
opened
her
eyes
when
he
appeared
but
did
not
seem
frightened
at
him
know
why
you
weep
said
curdie
i
am
sorry
for
you
is
hard
not
to
be
believed
just
because
one
speaks
the
truth
said
the
girl
that
seems
reason
enough
with
some
people
my
mother
taught
me
to
speak
the
truth
and
took
such
pains
with
me
that
i
should
find
it
hard
to
tell
a
lie
though
i
could
invent
many
a
story
these
servants
would
believe
at
once
for
the
truth
is
a
strange
thing
here
and
they
do
know
it
when
they
see
it
show
it
them
and
they
all
stare
as
if
it
were
a
wicked
lie
and
that
with
the
lie
yet
warm
that
has
just
left
their
own
mouths
you
are
a
stranger
she
said
and
burst
out
weeping
afresh
the
stranger
you
are
to
such
a
place
and
such
people
the
better
am
the
person
said
curdie
whom
you
saw
carrying
the
things
from
the
supper
table
he
showed
her
the
loaf
you
can
trust
as
well
as
speak
the
truth
i
will
trust
you
can
you
trust
me
she
looked
at
him
steadily
for
a
moment
can
she
answered
thing
more
said
curdie
you
courage
as
well
as
truth
think
so
my
dog
in
the
face
and
do
cry
out
come
here
lina
lina
obeyed
the
girl
looked
at
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
lina
head
i
know
you
are
a
true
woman
said
curdie
am
come
to
set
things
right
in
this
house
not
one
of
the
servants
knows
i
am
here
will
you
tell
them
tomorrow
morning
that
if
they
do
not
alter
their
ways
and
give
over
drinking
and
lying
and
stealing
and
unkindness
they
shall
every
one
of
them
be
driven
from
the
palace
will
not
believe
me
likely
but
will
you
give
them
the
chance
will
i
will
be
your
friend
wait
here
till
i
come
again
she
looked
him
once
more
in
the
face
and
sat
down
when
he
reached
the
royal
chamber
he
found
his
majesty
awake
and
very
anxiously
expecting
him
he
received
him
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
at
once
as
it
were
put
himself
in
his
hands
by
telling
him
all
he
knew
concerning
the
state
he
was
in
his
voice
was
feeble
but
his
eye
was
clear
although
now
and
then
his
words
and
thoughts
seemed
to
wander
curdie
could
not
be
certain
that
the
cause
of
their
not
being
intelligible
to
him
did
not
lie
in
himself
the
king
told
him
that
for
some
years
ever
since
his
queen
death
he
had
been
losing
heart
over
the
wickedness
of
his
people
he
had
tried
hard
to
make
them
good
but
they
got
worse
and
worse
evil
teachers
unknown
to
him
had
crept
into
the
schools
there
was
a
general
decay
of
truth
and
right
principle
at
least
in
the
city
and
as
that
set
the
example
to
the
nation
it
must
spread
the
main
cause
of
his
illness
was
the
despondency
with
which
the
degeneration
of
his
people
affected
him
he
could
not
sleep
and
had
terrible
dreams
while
to
his
unspeakable
shame
and
distress
he
doubted
almost
everybody
he
had
striven
against
his
suspicion
but
in
vain
and
his
heart
was
sore
for
his
courtiers
and
councillors
were
really
kind
only
he
could
not
think
why
none
of
their
ladies
came
near
his
princess
the
whole
country
was
discontented
he
heard
and
there
were
signs
of
gathering
storm
outside
as
well
as
inside
his
borders
the
master
of
the
horse
gave
him
sad
news
of
the
insubordination
of
the
army
and
his
great
white
horse
was
dead
they
told
him
and
his
sword
had
lost
its
temper
it
bent
double
the
last
time
he
tried
it
only
perhaps
that
was
in
a
dream
and
they
could
not
find
his
shield
and
one
of
his
spurs
had
lost
the
rowel
thus
the
poor
king
went
wandering
in
a
maze
of
sorrows
some
of
which
were
purely
imaginary
while
others
were
truer
than
he
understood
he
told
how
thieves
came
at
night
and
tried
to
take
his
crown
so
that
he
never
dared
let
it
out
of
his
hands
even
when
he
slept
and
how
every
night
an
evil
demon
in
the
shape
of
his
physician
came
and
poured
poison
down
his
throat
he
knew
it
to
be
poison
he
said
somehow
although
it
tasted
like
wine
here
he
stopped
faint
with
the
unusual
exertion
of
talking
curdie
seized
the
flagon
and
ran
to
the
wine
cellar
in
the
servants
hall
the
girl
still
sat
by
the
fire
waiting
for
him
as
he
returned
he
told
her
to
follow
him
and
left
her
at
the
chamber
door
until
he
should
rejoin
her
when
the
king
had
had
a
little
wine
he
informed
him
that
he
had
already
discovered
certain
of
his
enemies
and
one
of
the
worst
of
them
was
the
doctor
for
it
was
no
other
demon
than
the
doctor
himself
who
had
been
coming
every
night
and
giving
him
a
slow
poison
said
the
king
i
have
not
been
suspicious
enough
for
i
thought
it
was
but
a
dream
is
it
possible
kelman
can
be
such
a
wretch
who
then
am
i
to
trust
one
in
the
house
except
the
princess
and
myself
said
curdie
will
not
go
to
sleep
said
the
king
would
be
as
bad
as
taking
the
poison
said
curdie
no
sire
you
must
show
your
confidence
by
leaving
all
the
watching
to
me
and
doing
all
the
sleeping
your
majesty
can
the
king
smiled
a
contented
smile
turned
on
his
side
and
was
presently
fast
asleep
then
curdie
persuaded
the
princess
also
to
go
to
sleep
and
telling
lina
to
watch
went
to
the
housemaid
he
asked
her
if
she
could
inform
him
which
of
the
council
slept
in
the
palace
and
show
him
their
rooms
she
knew
every
one
of
them
she
said
and
took
him
the
round
of
all
their
doors
telling
him
which
slept
in
each
room
he
then
dismissed
her
and
returning
to
the
king
chamber
seated
himself
behind
a
curtain
at
the
head
of
the
bed
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
king
he
told
lina
to
get
under
the
bed
and
make
no
noise
about
one
the
doctor
came
stealing
in
he
looked
round
for
the
princess
and
seeing
no
one
smiled
with
satisfaction
as
he
approached
the
wine
where
it
stood
under
the
lamp
having
partly
filled
a
glass
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
phial
and
filled
up
the
glass
from
it
the
light
fell
upon
his
face
from
above
and
curdie
saw
the
snake
in
it
plainly
visible
he
had
never
beheld
such
an
evil
countenance
the
man
hated
the
king
and
delighted
in
doing
him
wrong
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
he
drew
near
the
bed
set
it
down
and
began
his
usual
rude
rousing
of
his
majesty
not
at
once
succeeding
he
took
a
lancet
from
his
pocket
and
was
parting
its
cover
with
an
involuntary
hiss
of
hate
between
his
closed
teeth
when
curdie
stooped
and
whispered
to
lina
him
by
the
leg
lina
she
darted
noiselessly
upon
him
with
a
face
of
horrible
consternation
he
gave
his
leg
one
tug
to
free
it
the
next
instant
curdie
heard
the
one
scrunch
with
which
she
crushed
the
bone
like
a
stick
of
celery
he
tumbled
on
the
floor
with
a
yell
him
out
lina
said
curdie
lina
took
him
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
out
her
master
followed
her
to
direct
her
and
they
left
the
doctor
lying
across
the
lord
chamberlain
door
where
he
gave
another
horrible
yell
and
fainted
the
king
had
waked
at
his
first
cry
and
by
the
time
curdie
he
had
got
at
his
sword
where
it
hung
from
the
centre
of
the
tester
had
drawn
it
and
was
trying
to
get
out
of
bed
but
when
curdie
told
him
all
was
well
he
lay
down
again
as
quietly
as
a
child
comforted
by
his
mother
from
a
troubled
dream
curdie
went
to
the
door
to
watch
the
doctor
yells
had
aroused
many
but
not
one
had
yet
ventured
to
appear
bells
were
rung
violently
but
none
were
answered
and
in
a
minute
or
two
curdie
had
what
he
was
watching
for
the
door
of
the
lord
chamberlain
room
opened
and
pale
with
hideous
terror
his
lordship
peeped
out
seeing
no
one
he
advanced
to
step
into
the
corridor
and
tumbled
over
the
doctor
curdie
ran
up
and
held
out
his
hand
he
received
in
it
the
claw
of
a
bird
of
prey
vulture
or
eagle
he
could
not
tell
which
his
lordship
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
legs
taking
him
for
one
of
the
pages
abused
him
heartily
for
not
coming
sooner
and
threatened
him
with
dismissal
from
the
king
service
for
cowardice
and
neglect
he
began
indeed
what
bade
fair
to
be
a
sermon
on
the
duties
of
a
page
but
catching
sight
of
the
man
who
lay
at
his
door
and
seeing
it
was
the
doctor
he
fell
upon
curdie
afresh
for
standing
there
doing
nothing
and
ordered
him
to
fetch
immediate
assistance
curdie
left
him
but
slipped
into
the
king
chamber
closed
and
locked
the
door
and
left
the
rascals
to
look
after
each
other
ere
long
he
heard
hurrying
footsteps
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
great
muffled
tumult
of
scuffling
feet
low
voices
and
deep
groanings
then
all
was
still
again
irene
slept
through
the
whole
so
confidently
did
she
rest
knowing
curdie
was
in
her
father
room
watching
over
him
chapter
the
prophecy
curdie
sat
and
watched
every
motion
of
the
sleeping
king
all
the
night
to
his
ear
the
palace
lay
as
quiet
as
a
nursery
of
healthful
children
at
sunrise
he
called
the
princess
has
his
majesty
slept
were
her
first
words
as
she
entered
the
room
quietly
answered
curdie
is
since
the
doctor
was
got
rid
of
did
you
manage
that
inquired
irene
and
curdie
had
to
tell
all
about
it
terrible
she
said
it
not
startle
the
king
dreadfully
did
rather
i
found
him
getting
out
of
bed
sword
in
hand
brave
old
man
cried
the
princess
so
old
said
curdie
you
will
soon
see
he
went
off
again
in
a
minute
or
so
but
for
a
little
while
he
was
restless
and
once
when
he
lifted
his
hand
it
came
down
on
the
spikes
of
his
crown
and
he
half
waked
where
is
the
crown
cried
irene
in
sudden
terror
stroked
his
hands
answered
curdie
took
the
crown
from
them
and
ever
since
he
has
slept
quietly
and
again
and
again
smiled
in
his
sleep
have
never
seen
him
do
that
said
the
princess
what
have
you
done
with
the
crown
curdie
said
curdie
moving
away
from
the
bedside
irene
followed
him
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
she
saw
a
strange
sight
lina
lay
at
full
length
fast
asleep
her
tail
stretched
out
straight
behind
her
and
her
forelegs
before
her
between
the
two
paws
meeting
in
front
of
it
her
nose
just
touching
it
behind
glowed
and
flashed
the
crown
like
a
nest
of
the
humming
birds
of
heaven
irene
gazed
and
looked
up
with
a
smile
what
if
the
thief
were
to
come
and
she
not
to
wake
she
said
i
try
her
and
as
she
spoke
she
stooped
toward
the
crown
no
no
cried
curdie
terrified
would
frighten
you
out
of
your
wits
i
would
do
it
to
show
you
but
she
would
wake
your
father
you
have
no
conception
with
what
a
roar
she
would
spring
at
my
throat
but
you
shall
see
how
lightly
she
wakes
the
moment
i
speak
to
her
lina
she
was
on
her
feet
the
same
instant
with
her
great
tail
sticking
out
straight
behind
her
just
as
it
had
been
lying

said
the
princess
and
patted
her
head
lina
wagged
her
tail
solemnly
like
the
boom
of
an
anchored
sloop
irene
took
the
crown
and
laid
it
where
the
king
would
see
it
when
he
woke
princess
said
curdie
must
leave
you
for
a
few
minutes
you
must
bolt
the
door
please
and
not
open
it
to
any
one
away
to
the
cellar
he
went
with
lina
taking
care
as
they
passed
through
the
servants
hall
to
get
her
a
good
breakfast
in
about
one
minute
she
had
eaten
what
he
gave
her
and
looked
up
in
his
face
it
was
not
more
she
wanted
but
work
so
out
of
the
cellar
they
went
through
the
passage
and
curdie
into
the
dungeon
where
he
pulled
up
lina
opened
the
door
let
her
out
and
shut
it
again
behind
her
as
he
reached
the
door
of
the
king
chamber
lina
was
flying
out
of
the
gate
of
gwyntystorm
as
fast
as
her
mighty
legs
could
carry
her
come
to
the
wench
growled
the
menservants
one
to
another
when
the
chambermaid
appeared
among
them
the
next
morning
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
they
could
not
understand
and
did
not
like
we
all
dirt
they
said
are
you
thinking
about
have
you
seen
yourself
in
the
glass
this
morning
miss
she
made
no
answer
you
want
to
be
treated
as
you
deserve
or
will
you
speak
you
hussy
said
the
first
would
fain
know
what
right
you
have
to
put
on
a
face
like
that
wo
believe
me
said
the
girl
course
not
what
is
it
must
tell
you
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
she
said
course
you
must
is
this
then
if
you
do
not
repent
of
your
bad
ways
you
are
all
going
to
be
punished
all
turned
out
of
the
palace
together
mighty
punishment
said
the
butler
good
riddance
say
i
of
the
trouble
of
keeping
minxes
like
you
in
order
and
why
pray
should
we
be
turned
out
what
have
i
to
repent
of
now
your
holiness
you
know
best
yourself
said
the
girl
pretty
piece
of
insolence
how
should
i
know
forsooth
what
a
menial
like
you
has
got
against
me
there
are
people
in
this
house
oh
i
not
blind
to
their
ways
but
every
one
for
himself
say
i
pray
miss
judgement
who
gave
you
such
an
impertinent
message
to
his
majesty
household
who
is
come
to
set
things
right
in
the
king
house
indeed
cried
the
butler
but
that
moment
the
thought
came
back
to
him
of
the
roar
he
had
heard
in
the
cellar
and
he
turned
pale
and
was
silent
the
steward
took
it
up
next
pray
pretty
prophetess
he
said
attempting
to
chuck
her
under
the
chin
have
i
got
to
repent
of
you
know
best
yourself
said
the
girl
have
but
to
look
into
your
books
or
your
heart
you
tell
me
then
what
i
have
to
repent
of
said
the
groom
of
the
chambers
you
know
best
yourself
said
the
girl
once
more
person
who
told
me
to
tell
you
said
the
servants
of
this
house
had
to
repent
of
thieving
and
lying
and
unkindness
and
drinking
and
they
will
be
made
to
repent
of
them
one
way
if
they
do
do
it
of
themselves
another
then
arose
a
great
hubbub
for
by
this
time
all
the
servants
in
the
house
were
gathered
about
her
and
all
talked
together
in
towering
indignation
indeed
cried
one
pretty
word
in
a
house
where
everything
is
left
lying
about
in
a
shameless
way
tempting
poor
innocent
girls
a
house
where
nobody
cares
for
anything
or
has
the
least
respect
to
the
value
of
property
suppose
you
envy
me
this
brooch
of
mine
said
another
was
just
a
half
sheet
of
note
paper
about
it
not
a
scrap
more
in
a
drawer
that
always
open
in
the
writing
table
in
the
study
what
sort
of
a
place
is
that
for
a
jewel
can
you
call
it
stealing
to
take
a
thing
from
such
a
place
as
that
nobody
cared
a
straw
about
it
it
might
as
well
have
been
in
the
dust
hole
if
it
had
been
locked
up
then
to
be
sure
said
the
chief
porter
with
a
husky
laugh
who
would
drink
when
he
had
a
chance
or
who
would
repent
it
except
that
the
drink
was
gone
tell
me
that
miss
innocence
said
a
great
coarse
footman
suppose
you
mean
when
i
told
you
yesterday
you
were
a
pretty
girl
when
you
did
pout
lying
indeed
tell
us
something
worth
repenting
of
lying
is
the
way
of
gwyntystorm
you
should
have
heard
jabez
lying
to
the
cook
last
night
he
wanted
a
sweetbread
for
his
pup
and
pretended
it
was
for
the
princess
ha
ha
ha
i
wonder
who
unkind
going
and
listening
to
any
stranger
against
her
fellow
servants
and
then
bringing
back
his
wicked
words
to
trouble
them
said
the
oldest
and
worst
of
the
housemaids
of
ourselves
too
come
you
hypocrite
this
is
all
an
invention
of
yours
and
your
young
man
to
take
your
revenge
of
us
because
we
found
you
out
in
a
lie
last
night
tell
true
now
was
it
the
same
that
stole
the
loaf
and
the
pie
that
sent
you
with
the
impudent
message
as
she
said
this
she
stepped
up
to
the
housemaid
and
gave
her
instead
of
time
to
answer
a
box
on
the
ear
that
almost
threw
her
down
and
whoever
could
get
at
her
began
to
push
and
bustle
and
pinch
and
punch
her
invite
your
fate
she
said
quietly
they
fell
furiously
upon
her
drove
her
from
the
hall
with
kicks
and
blows
hustled
her
along
the
passage
and
threw
her
down
the
stair
to
the
wine
cellar
then
locked
the
door
at
the
top
of
it
and
went
back
to
their
breakfast
in
the
meantime
the
king
and
the
princess
had
had
their
bread
and
wine
and
the
princess
with
curdie
help
had
made
the
room
as
tidy
as
she
could
they
were
terribly
neglected
by
the
servants
and
now
curdie
set
himself
to
interest
and
amuse
the
king
and
prevent
him
from
thinking
too
much
in
order
that
he
might
the
sooner
think
the
better
presently
at
his
majesty
request
he
began
from
the
beginning
and
told
everything
he
could
recall
of
his
life
about
his
father
and
mother
and
their
cottage
on
the
mountain
of
the
inside
of
the
mountain
and
the
work
there
about
the
goblins
and
his
adventures
with
them
when
he
came
to
finding
the
princess
and
her
nurse
overtaken
by
the
twilight
on
the
mountain
irene
took
up
her
share
of
the
tale
and
told
all
about
herself
to
that
point
and
then
curdie
took
it
up
again
and
so
they
went
on
each
fitting
in
the
part
that
the
other
did
not
know
thus
keeping
the
hoop
of
the
story
running
straight
and
the
king
listened
with
wondering
and
delighted
ears
astonished
to
find
what
he
could
so
ill
comprehend
yet
fitting
so
well
together
from
the
lips
of
two
narrators
at
last
with
the
mission
given
him
by
the
wonderful
princess
and
his
consequent
adventures
curdie
brought
up
the
whole
tale
to
the
present
moment
then
a
silence
fell
and
irene
and
curdie
thought
the
king
was
asleep
but
he
was
far
from
it
he
was
thinking
about
many
things
after
a
long
pause
he
said
at
last
my
children
i
am
compelled
to
believe
many
things
i
could
not
and
do
not
yet
understand
things
i
used
to
hear
and
sometimes
see
as
often
as
i
visited
my
mother
home
once
for
instance
i
heard
my
mother
say
to
her
father
speaking
of
me
he
is
a
good
honest
boy
but
he
will
be
an
old
man
before
he
understands
and
my
grandfather
answered
keep
up
your
heart
child
my
mother
will
look
after
him
i
thought
often
of
their
words
and
the
many
strange
things
besides
i
both
heard
and
saw
in
that
house
but
by
degrees
because
i
could
not
understand
them
i
gave
up
thinking
of
them
and
indeed
i
had
almost
forgotten
them
when
you
my
child
talking
that
day
about
the
queen
irene
and
her
pigeons
and
what
you
had
seen
in
her
garret
brought
them
all
back
to
my
mind
in
a
vague
mass
but
now
they
keep
coming
back
to
me
one
by
one
every
one
for
itself
and
i
shall
just
hold
my
peace
and
lie
here
quite
still
and
think
about
them
all
till
i
get
well
again
what
he
meant
they
could
not
quite
understand
but
they
saw
plainly
that
already
he
was
better
away
my
crown
he
said
am
tired
of
seeing
it
and
have
no
more
any
fear
of
its
safety
they
put
it
away
together
withdrew
from
the
bedside
and
left
him
in
peace
chapter
the
avengers
there
was
nothing
now
to
be
dreaded
from
dr
kelman
but
it
made
curdie
anxious
as
the
evening
drew
near
to
think
that
not
a
soul
belonging
to
the
court
had
been
to
visit
the
king
or
ask
how
he
did
that
day
he
feared
in
some
shape
or
other
a
more
determined
assault
he
had
provided
himself
a
place
in
the
room
to
which
he
might
retreat
upon
approach
and
whence
he
could
watch
but
not
once
had
he
had
to
betake
himself
to
it
towards
night
the
king
fell
asleep
curdie
thought
more
and
more
uneasily
of
the
moment
when
he
must
again
leave
them
for
a
little
while
deeper
and
deeper
fell
the
shadows
no
one
came
to
light
the
lamp
the
princess
drew
her
chair
close
to
curdie
she
would
rather
it
were
not
so
dark
she
said
she
was
afraid
of
something
she
could
not
tell
what
nor
could
she
give
any
reason
for
her
fear
but
that
all
was
so
dreadfully
still
when
it
had
been
dark
about
an
hour
curdie
thought
lina
might
have
returned
and
reflected
that
the
sooner
he
went
the
less
danger
was
there
of
any
assault
while
he
was
away
there
was
more
risk
of
his
own
presence
being
discovered
no
doubt
but
things
were
now
drawing
to
a
crisis
and
it
must
be
run
so
telling
the
princess
to
lock
all
the
doors
of
the
bedchamber
and
let
no
one
in
he
took
his
mattock
and
with
here
a
run
and
there
a
halt
under
cover
gained
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
cellar
stair
in
safety
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
locked
and
the
key
was
gone
there
was
no
time
for
deliberation
he
felt
where
the
lock
was
and
dealt
it
a
tremendous
blow
with
his
mattock
it
needed
but
a
second
to
dash
the
door
open
someone
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
is
it
said
curdie
told
you
they
would
believe
me
sir
said
the
housemaid
have
been
here
all
day
he
took
her
hand
and
said
are
a
good
brave
girl
now
come
with
me
lest
your
enemies
imprison
you
again
he
took
her
to
the
cellar
locked
the
door
lighted
a
bit
of
candle
gave
her
a
little
wine
told
her
to
wait
there
till
he
came
and
went
out
the
back
way
swiftly
he
swung
himself
up
into
the
dungeon
lina
had
done
her
part
the
place
was
swarming
with
creatures
animal
forms
wilder
and
more
grotesque
than
ever
ramped
in
nightmare
dream
close
by
the
hole
waiting
his
coming
her
green
eyes
piercing
the
gulf
below
lina
had
but
just
laid
herself
down
when
he
appeared
all
about
the
vault
and
up
the
slope
of
the
rubbish
heap
lay
and
stood
and
squatted
the
whose
friendship
lina
had
conquered
in
the
wood
they
all
came
crowding
about
curdie
he
must
get
them
into
the
cellar
as
quickly
as
ever
he
could
but
when
he
looked
at
the
size
of
some
of
them
he
feared
it
would
be
a
long
business
to
enlarge
the
hole
sufficiently
to
let
them
through
at
it
he
rushed
hitting
vigorously
at
the
edge
with
his
mattock
at
the
very
first
blow
came
a
splash
from
the
water
beneath
but
ere
he
could
heave
a
third
a
creature
like
a
tapir
only
that
the
grasping
point
of
its
proboscis
was
hard
as
the
steel
of
curdie
hammer
pushed
him
gently
aside
making
room
for
another
creature
with
a
head
like
a
great
club
which
it
began
banging
upon
the
floor
with
terrible
force
and
noise
after
about
a
minute
of
this
battery
the
tapir
came
up
again
shoved
clubhead
aside
and
putting
its
own
head
into
the
hole
began
gnawing
at
the
sides
of
it
with
the
finger
of
its
nose
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
fragments
fell
in
a
continuous
gravelly
shower
into
the
water
in
a
few
minutes
the
opening
was
large
enough
for
the
biggest
creature
among
them
to
get
through
it
next
came
the
difficulty
of
letting
them
down
some
were
quite
light
but
the
half
of
them
were
too
heavy
for
the
rope
not
to
say
for
his
arms
the
creatures
themselves
seemed
to
be
puzzling
where
or
how
they
were
to
go
one
after
another
of
them
came
up
looked
down
through
the
hole
and
drew
back
curdie
thought
if
he
let
lina
down
perhaps
that
would
suggest
something
possibly
they
did
not
see
the
opening
on
the
other
side
he
did
so
and
lina
stood
lighting
up
the
entrance
of
the
passage
with
her
gleaming
eyes
one
by
one
the
creatures
looked
down
again
and
one
by
one
they
drew
back
each
standing
aside
to
glance
at
the
next
as
if
to
say
now
you
have
a
look
at
last
it
came
to
the
turn
of
the
serpent
with
the
long
body
the
four
short
legs
behind
and
the
little
wings
before
no
sooner
had
he
poked
his
head
through
than
he
poked
it
farther
through
and
farther
and
farther
yet
until
there
was
little
more
than
his
legs
left
in
the
dungeon
by
that
time
he
had
got
his
head
and
neck
well
into
the
passage
beside
lina
then
his
legs
gave
a
great
waddle
and
spring
and
he
tumbled
himself
far
as
there
was
betwixt
them
heels
over
head
into
the
passage
is
all
very
well
for
you
mr
legserpent
thought
curdie
to
himself
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
rest
he
had
hardly
time
to
think
it
however
before
the
creature
head
appeared
again
through
the
floor
he
caught
hold
of
the
bar
of
iron
to
which
curdie
rope
was
tied
and
settling
it
securely
across
the
narrowest
part
of
the
irregular
opening
held
fast
to
it
with
his
teeth
it
was
plain
to
curdie
from
the
universal
hardness
among
them
that
they
must
all
at
one
time
or
another
have
been
creatures
of
the
mines
he
saw
at
once
what
this
one
was
after
the
beast
had
planted
his
feet
firmly
upon
the
floor
of
the
passage
and
stretched
his
long
body
up
and
across
the
chasm
to
serve
as
a
bridge
for
the
rest
curdie
mounted
instantly
upon
his
neck
threw
his
arms
round
him
as
far
as
they
would
go
and
slid
down
in
ease
and
safety
the
bridge
just
bending
a
little
as
his
weight
glided
over
it
but
he
thought
some
of
the
creatures
would
try
the
legserpent
teeth
one
by
one
the
oddities
followed
and
slid
down
in
safety
when
they
seemed
to
be
all
landed
he
counted
them
there
were
but
up
the
rope
again
he
went
and
found
one
which
had
been
afraid
to
trust
himself
to
the
bridge
and
no
wonder
for
he
had
neither
legs
nor
head
nor
arms
nor
tail
he
was
just
a
round
thing
about
a
foot
in
diameter
with
a
nose
and
mouth
and
eyes
on
one
side
of
the
ball
he
had
made
his
journey
by
rolling
as
swiftly
as
the
fleetest
of
them
could
run
the
back
of
the
legserpent
not
being
flat
he
could
not
quite
trust
himself
to
roll
straight
and
not
drop
into
the
gulf
curdie
took
him
in
his
arms
and
the
moment
he
looked
down
through
the
hole
the
bridge
made
itself
again
and
he
slid
into
the
passage
in
safety
with
ballbody
in
his
bosom
he
ran
first
to
the
cellar
to
warn
the
girl
not
to
be
frightened
at
the
avengers
of
wickedness
then
he
called
to
lina
to
bring
in
her
friends
one
after
another
they
came
trooping
in
till
the
cellar
seemed
full
of
them
the
housemaid
regarded
them
without
fear
she
said
is
one
of
the
pages
i
do
take
to
be
a
bad
fellow
keep
him
near
you
said
curdie
now
can
you
show
me
a
way
to
the
king
chamber
not
through
the
servants
hall
is
a
way
through
the
chamber
of
the
colonel
of
the
guard
she
answered
he
is
ill
and
in
bed
me
that
way
said
curdie
by
many
ups
and
downs
and
windings
and
turnings
she
brought
him
to
a
dimly
lighted
room
where
lay
an
elderly
man
asleep
his
arm
was
outside
the
coverlid
and
curdie
gave
his
hand
a
hurried
grasp
as
he
went
by
his
heart
beat
for
joy
for
he
had
found
a
good
honest
human
hand
suppose
that
is
why
he
is
ill
he
said
to
himself
it
was
now
close
upon
suppertime
and
when
the
girl
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
king
chamber
he
told
her
to
go
and
give
the
servants
one
warning
more
the
messenger
sent
you
he
said
will
be
with
you
very
soon
the
king
was
still
asleep
curdie
talked
to
the
princess
for
a
few
minutes
told
her
not
to
be
frightened
whatever
noises
she
heard
only
to
keep
her
door
locked
till
he
came
and
left
her
chapter
the
vengeance
by
the
time
the
girl
reached
the
servants
hall
they
were
seated
at
supper
a
loud
confused
exclamation
arose
when
she
entered
no
one
made
room
for
her
all
stared
with
unfriendly
eyes
a
page
who
entered
the
next
minute
by
another
door
came
to
her
side
do
you
come
from
hussy
shouted
the
butler
and
knocked
his
fist
on
the
table
with
a
loud
clang
he
had
gone
to
fetch
wine
had
found
the
stair
door
broken
open
and
the
cellar
door
locked
and
had
turned
and
fled
among
his
fellows
however
he
had
now
regained
what
courage
could
be
called
his
the
cellar
she
replied
messenger
broke
open
the
door
and
sent
me
to
you
again

messenger

sent
me
before
to
tell
you
to
repent
will

go
fooling

had
enough
of
it
cried
the
butler
in
a
rage
and
starting
to
his
feet
drew
near
threateningly
must
do
as
i
am
told
said
the
girl
why
do
you
do
as
i
tell
you
and
hold
your
tongue
said
the
butler
wants
your
preachments
if
anybody
here
has
anything
to
repent
of
is
that
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
him
but
you
must
come
bothering
about
and
stirring
up
till
not
a
drop
of
quiet
will
settle
inside
him
you
come
along
with
me
young
woman
we
see
if
we
ca
find
a
lock
somewhere
in
the
house
that
hold
you
in
off
mr
butler
said
the
page
and
stepped
between
ho
cried
the
butler
and
pointed
his
fat
finger
at
him
you
is
it
my
fine
fellow
so
it
you
that
up
to
her
tricks
is
it
the
youth
did
not
answer
only
stood
with
flashing
eyes
fixed
on
him
until
growing
angrier
and
angrier
but
not
daring
a
step
nearer
he
burst
out
with
a
rude
but
quavering
authority
the
house
both
of
you
be
off
or
i
have
mr
steward
to
talk
to
you
threaten
your
masters
indeed
out
of
the
house
with
you
and
show
us
the
way
you
tell
us
of
two
or
three
of
the
footmen
got
up
and
ranged
themselves
behind
the
butler
say
i
threaten
you
mr
butler
expostulated
the
girl
from
behind
the
page
messenger
said
i
was
to
tell
you
again
and
give
you
one
chance
more
the
messenger
mention
me
in
particular
asked
the
butler
looking
the
page
unsteadily
in
the
face
sir
answered
the
girl
thought
not
i
should
like
to
hear
him
hear
him
now
said
curdie
who
that
moment
entered
at
the
opposite
corner
of
the
hall
speak
of
the
butler
in
particular
when
i
say
that
i
know
more
evil
of
him
than
of
any
of
the
rest
he
will
not
let
either
his
own
conscience
or
my
messenger
speak
to
him
i
therefore
now
speak
myself
i
proclaim
him
a
villain
and
a
traitor
to
his
majesty
the
king
but
what
better
is
any
one
of
you
who
cares
only
for
himself
eats
drinks
takes
good
money
and
gives
vile
service
in
return
stealing
and
wasting
the
king
property
and
making
of
the
palace
which
ought
to
be
an
example
of
order
and
sobriety
a
disgrace
to
the
country
for
a
moment
all
stood
astonished
into
silence
by
this
bold
speech
from
a
stranger
true
they
saw
by
his
mattock
over
his
shoulder
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
miner
boy
yet
for
a
moment
the
truth
told
notwithstanding
then
a
great
roaring
laugh
burst
from
the
biggest
of
the
footmen
as
he
came
shouldering
his
way
through
the
crowd
toward
curdie
i
right
he
cried
thought
as
much
this
messenger
forsooth
is
nothing
but
a
gallows
bird
a
fellow
the
city
marshal
was
going
to
hang
but
unfortunately
put
it
off
till
he
should
be
starved
enough
to
save
rope
and
be
throttled
with
a
pack
thread
he
broke
prison
and
here
he
is
preaching
as
he
spoke
he
stretched
out
his
great
hand
to
lay
hold
of
him
curdie
caught
it
in
his
left
hand
and
heaved
his
mattock
with
the
other
finding
however
nothing
worse
than
an
ox
hoof
he
restrained
himself
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
shifted
his
mattock
to
his
left
hand
and
struck
him
a
little
smart
blow
on
the
shoulder
his
arm
dropped
by
his
side
he
gave
a
roar
and
drew
back
his
fellows
came
crowding
upon
curdie
some
called
to
the
dogs
others
swore
the
women
screamed
the
footmen
and
pages
got
round
him
in
a
half
circle
which
he
kept
from
closing
by
swinging
his
mattock
and
here
and
there
threatening
a
blow
confesses
to
having
done
anything
wrong
in
this
house
however
small
however
great
and
means
to
do
better
let
him
come
to
this
corner
of
the
room
he
cried
none
moved
but
the
page
who
went
toward
him
skirting
the
wall
when
they
caught
sight
of
him
the
crowd
broke
into
a
hiss
of
derision
see
look
at
the
sinner
he
confesses
actually
confesses
come
what
is
it
you
stole
the
barefaced
hypocrite
there
your
sort
to
set
up
for
reproving
other
people
where
the
other
now
but
the
maid
had
left
the
room
and
they
let
the
page
pass
for
he
looked
dangerous
to
stop
curdie
had
just
put
him
betwixt
him
and
the
wall
behind
the
door
when
in
rushed
the
butler
with
the
huge
kitchen
poker
the
point
of
which
he
had
blown
in
the
fire
followed
by
the
cook
with
his
longest
spit
through
the
crowd
which
scattered
right
and
left
before
them
they
came
down
upon
curdie
uttering
a
shrill
whistle
he
caught
the
poker
a
blow
with
his
mattock
knocking
the
point
to
the
ground
while
the
page
behind
him
started
forward
and
seizing
the
point
of
the
spit
held
on
to
it
with
both
hands
the
cook
kicking
him
furiously
ere
the
butler
could
raise
the
poker
again
or
the
cook
recover
the
spit
with
a
roar
to
terrify
the
dead
lina
dashed
into
the
room
her
eyes
flaming
like
candles
she
went
straight
at
the
butler
he
was
down
in
a
moment
and
she
on
the
top
of
him
wagging
her
tail
over
him
like
a
lioness
kill
him
lina
said
curdie
mr
miner
cried
the
butler
your
foot
on
his
mouth
lina
said
curdie
truth
fear
tells
is
not
much
better
than
her
lies
the
rest
of
the
creatures
now
came
stalking
rolling
leaping
gliding
hobbling
into
the
room
and
each
as
he
came
took
the
next
place
along
the
wall
until
solemn
and
grotesque
all
stood
ranged
awaiting
orders
and
now
some
of
the
culprits
were
stealing
to
the
doors
nearest
them
curdie
whispered
to
the
two
creatures
next
him
off
went
ballbody
rolling
and
bounding
through
the
crowd
like
a
spent
cannon
shot
and
when
the
foremost
reached
the
door
to
the
corridor
there
he
lay
at
the
foot
of
it
grinning
to
the
other
door
scuttled
a
scorpion
as
big
as
a
huge
crab
the
rest
stood
so
still
that
some
began
to
think
they
were
only
boys
dressed
up
to
look
awful
they
persuaded
themselves
they
were
only
another
part
of
the
housemaid
and
page
vengeful
contrivance
and
their
evil
spirits
began
to
rise
again
meantime
curdie
had
with
a
second
sharp
blow
from
the
hammer
of
his
mattock
disabled
the
cook
so
that
he
yielded
the
spit
with
a
groan
he
now
turned
to
the
avengers
at
them
he
said
the
whole
obeyed
at
once
each
for
himself
and
after
his
own
fashion
a
scene
of
confusion
and
terror
followed
the
crowd
scattered
like
a
dance
of
flies
the
creatures
had
been
instructed
not
to
hurt
much
but
to
hunt
incessantly
until
everyone
had
rushed
from
the
house
the
women
shrieked
and
ran
hither
and
thither
through
the
hall
pursued
each
by
her
own
horror
and
snapped
at
by
every
other
in
passing
if
one
threw
herself
down
in
hysterical
despair
she
was
instantly
poked
or
clawed
or
nibbled
up
again
though
they
were
quite
as
frightened
at
first
the
men
did
not
run
so
fast
and
by
and
by
some
of
them
finding
they
were
only
glared
at
and
followed
and
pushed
began
to
summon
up
courage
once
more
and
with
courage
came
impudence
the
tapir
had
the
big
footman
in
charge
the
fellow
stood
and
let
the
beast
come
up
to
him
then
put
out
his
finger
and
playfully
patted
his
nose
the
tapir
gave
the
nose
a
little
twist
and
the
finger
lay
on
the
floor
then
indeed
did
the
footman
run
gradually
the
avengers
grew
more
severe
and
the
terrors
of
the
imagination
were
fast
yielding
to
those
of
sensuous
experience
when
a
page
perceiving
one
of
the
doors
no
longer
guarded
sprang
at
it
and
ran
out
another
and
another
followed
not
a
beast
went
after
until
one
by
one
they
were
every
one
gone
from
the
hall
and
the
whole
crew
in
the
kitchen
there
they
were
beginning
to
congratulate
themselves
that
all
was
over
when
in
came
the
creatures
trooping
after
them
and
the
second
act
of
their
terror
and
pain
began
they
were
flung
about
in
all
directions
their
clothes
were
torn
from
them
they
were
pinched
and
scratched
and
everywhere
ballbody
kept
rolling
up
them
and
over
them
confining
his
attentions
to
no
one
in
particular
the
scorpion
kept
grabbing
at
their
legs
with
his
huge
pincers
a
centipede
kept
screwing
up
their
bodies
nipping
as
he
went
varied
as
numerous
were
their
woes
nor
was
it
long
before
the
last
of
them
had
fled
from
the
kitchen
to
the
sculleries
but
thither
also
they
were
followed
and
there
again
they
were
hunted
about
they
were
bespattered
with
the
dirt
of
their
own
neglect
they
were
soused
in
the
stinking
water
that
had
boiled
greens
they
were
smeared
with
rancid
dripping
their
faces
were
rubbed
in
maggots
i
dare
not
tell
all
that
was
done
to
them
at
last
they
got
the
door
into
a
back
yard
open
and
rushed
out
then
first
they
knew
that
the
wind
was
howling
and
the
rain
falling
in
sheets
but
there
was
no
rest
for
them
even
there
thither
also
were
they
followed
by
the
inexorable
avengers
and
the
only
door
here
was
a
door
out
of
the
palace
out
every
soul
of
them
was
driven
and
left
some
standing
some
lying
some
crawling
to
the
farther
buffeting
of
the
waterspouts
and
whirlwinds
ranging
every
street
of
the
city
the
door
was
flung
to
behind
them
and
they
heard
it
locked
and
bolted
and
barred
against
them
chapter
more
vengeance
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
curdie
brought
the
creatures
back
to
the
servants
hall
and
told
them
to
eat
up
everything
on
the
table
it
was
a
sight
to
see
them
all
standing
round
it
except
such
as
had
to
get
upon
it
eating
and
drinking
each
after
its
fashion
without
a
smile
or
a
word
or
a
glance
of
fellowship
in
the
act
a
very
few
moments
served
to
make
everything
eatable
vanish
and
then
curdie
requested
them
to
clean
house
and
the
page
who
stood
by
to
assist
them
every
one
set
about
it
except
ballbody
he
could
do
nothing
at
cleaning
for
the
more
he
rolled
the
more
he
spread
the
dirt
curdie
was
curious
to
know
what
he
had
been
and
how
he
had
come
to
be
such
as
he
was
but
he
could
only
conjecture
that
he
was
a
gluttonous
alderman
whom
nature
had
treated
homeopathically
and
now
there
was
such
a
cleaning
and
clearing
out
of
neglected
places
such
a
burying
and
burning
of
refuse
such
a
rinsing
of
jugs
such
a
swilling
of
sinks
and
such
a
flushing
of
drains
as
would
have
delighted
the
eyes
of
all
true
housekeepers
and
lovers
of
cleanliness
generally
curdie
meantime
was
with
the
king
telling
him
all
he
had
done
they
had
heard
a
little
noise
but
not
much
for
he
had
told
the
avengers
to
repress
outcry
as
much
as
possible
and
they
had
seen
to
it
that
the
more
anyone
cried
out
the
more
he
had
to
cry
out
upon
while
the
patient
ones
they
scarcely
hurt
at
all
having
promised
his
majesty
and
her
royal
highness
a
good
breakfast
curdie
now
went
to
finish
the
business
the
courtiers
must
be
dealt
with
a
few
who
were
the
worst
and
the
leaders
of
the
rest
must
be
made
examples
of
the
others
should
be
driven
to
the
street
he
found
the
chiefs
of
the
conspiracy
holding
a
final
consultation
in
the
smaller
room
off
the
hall
these
were
the
lord
chamberlain
the
the
master
of
the
horse
and
the
king
private
secretary
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
rest
as
foolish
as
faithless
were
but
the
tools
of
these
the
housemaid
had
shown
him
a
little
closet
opening
from
a
passage
behind
where
he
could
overhear
all
that
passed
in
that
room
and
now
curdie
heard
enough
to
understand
that
they
had
determined
in
the
dead
of
that
night
rather
in
the
deepest
dark
before
the
morning
to
bring
a
certain
company
of
soldiers
into
the
palace
make
away
with
the
king
secure
the
princess
announce
the
sudden
death
of
his
majesty
read
as
his
the
will
they
had
drawn
up
and
proceed
to
govern
the
country
at
their
ease
and
with
results
they
would
at
once
levy
severer
taxes
and
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
most
powerful
of
their
neighbours
everything
settled
they
agreed
to
retire
and
have
a
few
hours
quiet
sleep
first
all
but
the
secretary
who
was
to
sit
up
and
call
them
at
the
proper
moment
curdie
allowed
them
half
an
hour
to
get
to
bed
and
then
set
about
completing
his
purgation
of
the
palace
first
he
called
lina
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
secretary
sat
she
crept
in
and
laid
herself
down
against
it
when
the
secretary
rising
to
stretch
his
legs
caught
sight
of
her
eyes
he
stood
frozen
with
terror
she
made
neither
motion
nor
sound
gathering
courage
and
taking
the
thing
for
a
spectral
illusion
he
made
a
step
forward
she
showed
her
other
teeth
with
a
growl
neither
more
than
audible
nor
less
than
horrible
the
secretary
sank
fainting
into
a
chair
he
was
not
a
brave
man
and
besides
his
conscience
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
and
was
sitting
against
the
door
by
lina
to
the
lord
chamberlain
door
next
curdie
conducted
the
legserpent
and
let
him
in
now
his
lordship
had
had
a
bedstead
made
for
himself
sweetly
fashioned
of
rods
of
silver
gilt
upon
it
the
legserpent
found
him
asleep
and
under
it
he
crept
but
out
he
came
on
the
other
side
and
crept
over
it
next
and
again
under
it
and
so
over
it
under
it
over
it
five
or
six
times
every
time
leaving
a
coil
of
himself
behind
him
until
he
had
softly
folded
all
his
length
about
the
lord
chamberlain
and
his
bed
this
done
he
set
up
his
head
looking
down
with
curved
neck
right
over
his
lordship
and
began
to
hiss
in
his
face
he
woke
in
terror
unspeakable
and
would
have
started
up
but
the
moment
he
moved
the
legserpent
drew
his
coils
closer
and
closer
still
and
drew
and
drew
until
the
quaking
traitor
heard
the
joints
of
his
bedstead
grinding
and
gnarring
presently
he
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
only
a
horrid
nightmare
and
began
to
struggle
with
all
his
strength
to
throw
it
off
thereupon
the
legserpent
gave
his
hooked
nose
such
a
bite
that
his
teeth
met
through
it
but
it
was
hardly
thicker
than
the
bowl
of
a
spoon
and
then
the
vulture
knew
that
he
was
in
the
grasp
of
his
enemy
the
snake
and
yielded
as
soon
as
he
was
quiet
the
legserpent
began
to
untwist
and
retwist
to
uncoil
and
recoil
himself
swinging
and
swaying
knotting
and
relaxing
himself
with
strangest
curves
and
convolutions
always
however
leaving
at
least
one
coil
around
his
victim
at
last
he
undid
himself
entirely
and
crept
from
the
bed
then
first
the
lord
chamberlain
discovered
that
his
tormentor
had
bent
and
twisted
the
bedstead
legs
and
canopy
and
all
so
about
him
that
he
was
shut
in
a
silver
cage
out
of
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
find
a
way
once
more
thinking
his
enemy
was
gone
he
began
to
shout
for
help
but
the
instant
he
opened
his
mouth
his
keeper
darted
at
him
and
bit
him
and
after
three
or
four
such
essays
he
lay
still
the
master
of
the
horse
curdie
gave
in
charge
to
the
tapir
when
the
soldier
saw
him
enter
for
he
was
not
yet
asleep
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
flew
at
him
with
his
sword
but
the
creature
hide
was
invulnerable
to
his
blows
and
he
pecked
at
his
legs
with
his
proboscis
until
he
jumped
into
bed
again
groaning
and
covered
himself
up
after
which
the
tapir
contented
himself
with
now
and
then
paying
a
visit
to
his
toes
as
for
the
curdie
led
to
his
door
a
huge
spider
about
two
feet
long
in
the
body
which
having
made
an
excellent
supper
was
full
of
webbing
the
had
not
gone
to
bed
but
sat
in
a
chair
asleep
before
a
great
mirror
he
had
been
trying
the
effect
of
a
diamond
star
which
he
had
that
morning
taken
from
the
jewel
room
when
he
woke
he
fancied
himself
paralysed
every
limb
every
finger
even
was
motionless
coils
and
coils
of
broad
spider
ribbon
bandaged
his
members
to
his
body
and
all
to
the
chair
in
the
glass
he
saw
himself
wound
about
with
slavery
infinite
on
a
footstool
a
yard
off
sat
the
spider
glaring
at
him
clubhead
had
mounted
guard
over
the
butler
where
he
lay
tied
hand
and
foot
under
the
third
cask
from
that
cask
he
had
seen
the
wine
run
into
a
great
bath
and
therein
he
expected
to
be
drowned
the
doctor
with
his
crushed
leg
needed
no
one
to
guard
him
and
now
curdie
proceeded
to
the
expulsion
of
the
rest
great
men
or
underlings
he
treated
them
all
alike
from
room
to
room
over
the
house
he
went
and
sleeping
or
waking
took
the
man
by
the
hand
such
was
the
state
to
which
a
year
of
wicked
rule
had
reduced
the
moral
condition
of
the
court
that
in
it
all
he
found
but
three
with
human
hands
the
possessors
of
these
he
allowed
to
dress
themselves
and
depart
in
peace
when
they
perceived
his
mission
and
how
he
was
backed
they
yielded
then
commenced
a
general
hunt
to
clear
the
house
of
the
vermin
out
of
their
beds
in
their
night
clothing
out
of
their
rooms
gorgeous
chambers
or
garret
nooks
the
creatures
hunted
them
not
one
was
allowed
to
escape
tumult
and
noise
there
was
little
for
fear
was
too
deadly
for
outcry
ferreting
them
out
everywhere
following
them
upstairs
and
downstairs
yielding
no
instant
of
repose
except
upon
the
way
out
the
avengers
persecuted
the
miscreants
until
the
last
of
them
was
shivering
outside
the
palace
gates
with
hardly
sense
enough
left
to
know
where
to
turn
when
they
set
out
to
look
for
shelter
they
found
every
inn
full
of
the
servants
expelled
before
them
and
not
one
would
yield
his
place
to
a
superior
suddenly
levelled
with
himself
most
houses
refused
to
admit
them
on
the
ground
of
the
wickedness
that
must
have
drawn
on
them
such
a
punishment
and
not
a
few
would
have
been
left
in
the
streets
all
night
had
not
derba
roused
by
the
vain
entreaties
at
the
doors
on
each
side
of
her
cottage
opened
hers
and
given
up
everything
to
them
the
lord
chancellor
was
only
too
glad
to
share
a
mattress
with
a
stableboy
and
steal
his
bare
feet
under
his
jacket
in
the
morning
curdie
appeared
and
the
outcasts
were
in
terror
thinking
he
had
come
after
them
again
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
his
object
was
to
request
derba
to
go
to
the
palace
the
king
required
her
services
she
need
take
no
trouble
about
her
cottage
he
said
the
palace
was
henceforward
her
home
she
was
the
king
chatelaine
over
men
and
maidens
of
his
household
and
this
very
morning
she
must
cook
his
majesty
a
nice
breakfast
chapter
the
preacher
various
reports
went
undulating
through
the
city
as
to
the
nature
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
palace
the
people
gathered
and
stared
at
the
house
eyeing
it
as
if
it
had
sprung
up
in
the
night
but
it
looked
sedate
enough
remaining
closed
and
silent
like
a
house
that
was
dead
they
saw
no
one
come
out
or
go
in
smoke
arose
from
a
chimney
or
two
there
was
hardly
another
sign
of
life
it
was
not
for
some
little
time
generally
understood
that
the
highest
officers
of
the
crown
as
well
as
the
lowest
menials
of
the
palace
had
been
dismissed
in
disgrace
for
who
was
to
recognize
a
lord
chancellor
in
his
nightshirt
and
what
lord
chancellor
would
so
attired
in
the
street
proclaim
his
rank
and
office
aloud
before
it
was
day
most
of
the
courtiers
crept
down
to
the
river
hired
boats
and
betook
themselves
to
their
homes
or
their
friends
in
the
country
it
was
assumed
in
the
city
that
the
domestics
had
been
discharged
upon
a
sudden
discovery
of
general
and
unpardonable
peculation
for
almost
everybody
being
guilty
of
it
himself
petty
dishonesty
was
the
crime
most
easily
credited
and
least
easily
passed
over
in
gwyntystorm
now
that
same
day
was
religion
day
and
not
a
few
of
the
clergy
always
glad
to
seize
on
any
passing
event
to
give
interest
to
the
dull
and
monotonic
grind
of
their
intellectual
machines
made
this
remarkable
one
the
ground
of
discourse
to
their
congregations
more
especially
than
the
rest
the
first
priest
of
the
great
temple
where
was
the
royal
pew
judged
himself
from
his
relation
to
the
palace
called
upon
to
the
occasion
for
they
talked
ever
about
improvement
at
gwyntystorm
all
the
time
they
were
going
down
hill
with
a
rush
the
book
which
had
of
late
years
come
to
be
considered
the
most
sacred
was
called
the
book
of
nations
and
consisted
of
proverbs
and
history
traced
through
custom
from
it
the
first
priest
chose
his
text
and
his
text
was
is
the
best
policy
he
was
considered
a
very
eloquent
man
but
i
can
offer
only
a
few
of
the
larger
bones
of
his
sermon
the
main
proof
of
the
verity
of
their
religion
he
said
was
that
things
always
went
well
with
those
who
profess
it
and
its
first
fundamental
principle
grounded
in
inborn
invariable
instinct
was
that
every
one
should
take
care
of
that
one
this
was
the
first
duty
of
man
if
every
one
would
but
obey
this
law
number
one
then
would
every
one
be
perfectly
cared
for
one
being
always
equal
to
one
but
the
faculty
of
care
was
in
excess
of
need
and
all
that
overflowed
and
would
otherwise
run
to
waste
ought
to
be
gently
turned
in
the
direction
of
one
neighbour
seeing
that
this
also
wrought
for
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
inasmuch
as
the
reaction
of
excess
so
directed
was
upon
the
director
of
the
same
to
the
comfort
that
is
and
of
the
original
self
to
be
just
and
friendly
was
to
build
the
warmest
and
safest
of
all
nests
and
to
be
kind
and
loving
was
to
line
it
with
the
softest
of
all
furs
and
feathers
for
the
one
precious
self
there
to
lie
revelling
in
downiest
bliss
one
of
the
laws
therefore
most
binding
upon
men
because
of
its
relation
to
the
first
and
greatest
of
all
duties
was
embodied
in
the
proverb
he
had
just
read
and
what
stronger
proof
of
its
wisdom
and
truth
could
they
desire
than
the
sudden
and
complete
vengeance
which
had
fallen
upon
those
worse
than
ordinary
sinners
who
had
offended
against
the
king
majesty
by
forgetting
that
is
the
best
policy
at
this
point
of
the
discourse
the
head
of
the
legserpent
rose
from
the
floor
of
the
temple
towering
above
the
pulpit
above
the
priest
then
curving
downward
with
open
mouth
slowly
descended
upon
him
horror
froze
the
he
stared
upward
aghast
the
great
teeth
of
the
animal
closed
upon
a
mouthful
of
the
sacred
vestments
and
slowly
he
lifted
the
preacher
from
the
pulpit
like
a
handful
of
linen
from
a
washtub
and
on
his
four
solemn
stumps
bore
him
out
of
the
temple
dangling
aloft
from
his
jaws
at
the
back
of
it
he
dropped
him
into
the
dust
hole
among
the
remnants
of
a
library
whose
age
had
destroyed
its
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
chapter
they
found
him
burrowing
in
it
a
lunatic
henceforth
whose
madness
presented
the
peculiar
feature
that
in
its
paroxysms
he
jabbered
sense
horror
pervaded
gwyntystorm
if
their
best
and
wisest
were
treated
with
such
contempt
what
might
not
the
rest
of
them
look
for
alas
for
their
city
their
grandly
respectable
city
their
loftily
reasonable
city
where
it
was
all
to
end
who
could
tell
but
something
must
be
done
hastily
assembling
the
priests
chose
a
new
first
priest
and
in
full
conclave
unanimously
declared
and
accepted
that
the
king
in
his
retirement
had
through
the
practice
of
the
blackest
magic
turned
the
palace
into
a
nest
of
demons
in
the
midst
of
them
a
grand
exorcism
was
therefore
indispensable
in
the
meantime
the
fact
came
out
that
the
greater
part
of
the
courtiers
had
been
dismissed
as
well
as
the
servants
and
this
fact
swelled
the
hope
of
the
party
of
decency
as
they
called
themselves
upon
it
they
proceeded
to
act
and
strengthened
themselves
on
all
sides
the
action
of
the
king
bodyguard
remained
for
a
time
uncertain
but
when
at
length
its
officers
were
satisfied
that
both
the
master
of
the
horse
and
their
colonel
were
missing
they
placed
themselves
under
the
orders
of
the
first
priest
every
one
dated
the
culmination
of
the
evil
from
the
visit
of
the
miner
and
his
mongrel
and
the
butchers
vowed
if
they
could
but
get
hold
of
them
again
they
would
roast
both
of
them
alive
at
once
they
formed
themselves
into
a
regiment
and
put
their
dogs
in
training
for
attack
incessant
was
the
talk
innumerable
were
the
suggestions
and
great
was
the
deliberation
the
general
consent
however
was
that
as
soon
as
the
priests
should
have
expelled
the
demons
they
would
depose
the
king
and
attired
in
all
his
regal
insignia
shut
him
in
a
cage
for
public
show
then
choose
governors
with
the
lord
chancellor
at
their
head
whose
first
duty
should
be
to
remit
every
possible
tax
and
the
magistrates
by
the
mouth
of
the
city
marshal
required
all
citizens
in
order
to
do
their
part
toward
the
carrying
out
of
these
and
a
multitude
of
other
reforms
to
be
ready
to
take
arms
at
the
first
summons
things
needful
were
prepared
as
speedily
as
possible
and
a
mighty
ceremony
in
the
temple
in
the
market
place
and
in
front
of
the
palace
was
performed
for
the
expulsion
of
the
demons
this
over
the
leaders
retired
to
arrange
an
attack
upon
the
palace
but
that
night
events
occurred
which
proving
the
failure
of
their
first
induced
the
abandonment
of
their
second
intent
certain
of
the
prowling
order
of
the
community
whose
numbers
had
of
late
been
steadily
on
the
increase

frightful
things
demons
of
indescribable
ugliness
had
been
espied
careering
through
the
midnight
streets
and
courts
a
citizen
some
said
in
the
very
act
of
housebreaking
but
no
one
cared
to
look
into
trifles
at
such
a
crisis
had
been
seized
from
behind
he
could
not
see
by
what
and
soused
in
the
river
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
had
had
his
shop
broken
open
and
when
he
came
down
in
the
morning
had
found
everything
in
ruin
on
the
pavement
the
wooden
image
of
justice
over
the
door
of
the
city
marshal
had
had
the
arm
that
held
the
sword
bitten
off
the
gluttonous
magistrate
had
been
pulled
from
his
bed
in
the
dark
by
beings
of
which
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
flaming
eyes
and
treated
to
a
bath
of
the
turtle
soup
that
had
been
left
simmering
by
the
side
of
the
kitchen
fire
having
poured
it
over
him
they
put
him
again
into
his
bed
where
he
soon
learned
how
a
mummy
must
feel
in
its
cerements
worst
of
all
in
the
market
place
was
fixed
up
a
paper
with
the
own
signature
to
the
effect
that
whoever
henceforth
should
show
inhospitality
to
strangers
and
should
be
convicted
of
the
same
should
be
instantly
expelled
the
city
while
a
second
in
the
quarter
ordained
that
any
dog
which
henceforth
should
attack
a
stranger
should
be
immediately
destroyed
it
was
plain
said
the
butchers
that
the
clergy
were
of
no
use
they
could
not
exorcise
demons
that
afternoon
catching
sight
of
a
poor
old
fellow
in
rags
and
tatters
quietly
walking
up
the
street
they
hounded
their
dogs
upon
him
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
door
of
derba
cottage
was
standing
open
and
was
near
enough
for
him
to
dart
in
and
shut
it
ere
they
reached
him
he
would
have
been
torn
in
pieces
and
thus
things
went
on
for
some
days
chapter

in
the
meantime
with
derba
to
minister
to
his
wants
with
curdie
to
protect
him
and
irene
to
nurse
him
the
king
was
getting
rapidly
stronger
good
food
was
what
he
most
wanted
and
of
that
at
least
of
certain
kinds
of
it
there
was
plentiful
store
in
the
palace
everywhere
since
the
cleansing
of
the
lower
regions
of
it
the
air
was
clean
and
sweet
and
under
the
honest
hands
of
the
one
housemaid
the
king
chamber
became
a
pleasure
to
his
eyes
with
such
changes
it
was
no
wonder
if
his
heart
grew
lighter
as
well
as
his
brain
clearer
but
still
evil
dreams
came
and
troubled
him
the
lingering
result
of
the
wicked
medicines
the
doctor
had
given
him
every
night
sometimes
twice
or
thrice
he
would
wake
up
in
terror
and
it
would
be
minutes
ere
he
could
come
to
himself
the
consequence
was
that
he
was
always
worse
in
the
morning
and
had
loss
to
make
up
during
the
day
while
he
slept
irene

curdie
one
or
the
other
must
still
be
always
by
his
side
one
night
when
it
was
curdie
turn
with
the
king
he
heard
a
cry
somewhere
in
the
house
and
as
there
was
no
other
child
concluded
notwithstanding
the
distance
of
her
grandmother
room
that
it
must
be
barbara
fearing
something
might
be
wrong
and
noting
the
king
sleep
more
quiet
than
usual
he
ran
to
see
he
found
the
child
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
weeping
bitterly
and
derba
slumbering
peacefully
in
bed
the
instant
she
saw
him
the
thing
ceased
her
crying
smiled
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
unwilling
to
wake
the
old
woman
who
had
been
working
hard
all
day
he
took
the
child
and
carried
her
with
him
she
clung
to
him
so
pressing
her
radiant
face
against
his
that
her
little
arms
threatened
to
choke
him
when
he
the
chamber
he
found
the
king
sitting
up
in
bed
fighting
the
phantoms
of
some
hideous
dream
generally
upon
such
occasions
although
he
saw
his
watcher
he
could
not
dissociate
him
from
the
dream
and
went
raving
on
but
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
little
barbara
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
his
soul
came
into
them
with
a
rush
and
a
smile
like
the
dawn
of
an
eternal
day
overspread
his
countenance
the
dream
was
nowhere
and
the
child
was
in
his
heart
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
the
child
stretched
out
hers
to
him
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
both
asleep
each
in
the
other
embrace
from
that
night
barbara
had
a
crib
in
the
king
chamber
and
as
often
as
he
woke
irene
or
curdie
whichever
was
watching
took
the
sleeping
child
and
laid
her
in
his
arms
upon
which
invariably
and
instantly
the
dream
would
vanish
a
great
part
of
the
day
too
she
would
be
playing
on
or
about
the
king
bed
and
it
was
a
delight
to
the
heart
of
the
princess
to
see
her
amusing
herself
with
the
crown
now
sitting
upon
it
now
rolling
it
hither
and
thither
about
the
room
like
a
hoop
her
grandmother
entering
once
while
she
was
pretending
to
make
porridge
in
it
held
up
her
hands
in
amazement
but
the
king
would
not
allow
her
to
interfere
for
the
king
was
now
barbara
playmate
and
his
crown
their
plaything
the
colonel
of
the
guard
also
was
growing
better
curdie
went
often
to
see
him
they
were
soon
friends
for
the
best
people
understand
each
other
the
easiest
and
the
grim
old
warrior
loved
the
miner
boy
as
if
he
were
at
once
his
son
and
his
angel
he
was
very
anxious
about
his
regiment
he
said
the
officers
were
mostly
honest
men
he
believed
but
how
they
might
be
doing
without
him
or
what
they
might
resolve
in
ignorance
of
the
real
state
of
affairs
and
exposed
to
every
misrepresentation
who
could
tell
curdie
proposed
that
he
should
send
for
the
major
offering
to
be
the
messenger
the
colonel
agreed
and
curdie
went
not
without
his
mattock
because
of
the
dogs
but
the
officers
had
been
told
by
the
master
of
the
horse
that
their
colonel
was
dead
and
although
they
were
amazed
he
should
be
buried
without
the
attendance
of
his
regiment
they
never
doubted
the
information
the
handwriting
itself
of
their
colonel
was
insufficient
counteracted
by
the
fresh
reports
daily
current
to
destroy
the
lie
the
major
regarded
the
letter
as
a
trap
for
the
next
officer
in
command
and
sent
his
orderly
to
arrest
the
messenger
but
curdie
had
had
the
wisdom
not
to
wait
for
an
answer
the
king
enemies
said
that
he
had
first
poisoned
the
good
colonel
of
the
guard
and
then
murdered
the
master
of
the
horse
and
other
faithful
councillors
and
that
his
oldest
and
most
attached
domestics
had
but
escaped
from
the
palace
with
their
lives
not
all
of
them
for
the
butler
was
missing
mad
or
wicked
he
was
not
only
unfit
to
rule
any
longer
but
worse
than
unfit
to
have
in
his
power
and
under
his
influence
the
young
princess
only
hope
of
gwyntystorm
and
the
kingdom
the
moment
the
lord
chancellor
reached
his
house
in
the
country
and
had
got
himself
clothed
he
began
to
devise
how
yet
to
destroy
his
master
and
the
very
next
morning
set
out
for
the
neighbouring
kingdom
of
borsagrass
to
invite
invasion
and
offer
a
compact
with
its
monarch
chapter
peter
at
the
cottage
in
the
mountain
everything
for
a
time
went
on
just
as
before
it
was
indeed
dull
without
curdie
but
as
often
as
they
looked
at
the
emerald
it
was
gloriously
green
and
with
nothing
to
fear
or
regret
and
everything
to
hope
they
required
little
comforting
one
morning
however
at
last
peter
who
had
been
consulting
the
gem
rather
now
from
habit
than
anxiety
as
a
farmer
his
barometer
in
undoubtful
weather
turned
suddenly
to
his
wife
the
stone
in
his
hand
and
held
it
up
with
a
look
of
ghastly
dismay
that
never
the
emerald
said
joan
is
answered
peter
it
were
small
blame
to
any
one
that
took
it
for
a
bit
of
bottle
glass
for
all
save
one
spot
right
in
the
centre
of
intensest
and
most
brilliant
green
it
looked
as
if
the
colour
had
been
burnt
out
of
it
run
peter
cried
his
wife
and
tell
the
old
princess
it
may
not
be
too
late
the
boy
must
be
lying
at
death
door
without
a
word
peter
caught
up
his
mattock
darted
from
the
cottage
and
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
in
less
time
than
he
usually
took
to
get
halfway
the
door
of
the
king
house
stood
open
he
rushed
in
and
up
the
stair
but
after
wandering
about
in
vain
for
an
hour
opening
door
after
door
and
finding
no
way
farther
up
the
heart
of
the
old
man
had
failed
him
empty
rooms
empty
rooms
desertion
and
desolation
everywhere
at
last
he
did
come
upon
the
door
to
the
tower
stair
up
he
darted
arrived
at
the
top
he
found
three
doors
and
one
after
the
other
knocked
at
them
all
but
there
was
neither
voice
nor
hearing
urged
by
his
faith
and
his
dread
slowly
hesitatingly
he
opened
one
it
revealed
a
bare
garret
room
nothing
in
it
but
one
chair
and
one
spinning
wheel
he
closed
it
and
opened
the
next
to
start
back
in
terror
for
he
saw
nothing
but
a
great
gulf
a
moonless
night
full
of
stars
and
for
all
the
stars
dark
dark
a
fathomless
abyss
he
opened
the
third
door
and
a
rush
like
the
tide
of
a
living
sea
invaded
his
ears
multitudinous
wings
flapped
and
flashed
in
the
sun
and
like
the
ascending
column
from
a
volcano
white
birds
innumerable
shot
into
the
air
darkening
the
day
with
the
shadow
of
their
cloud
and
then
with
a
sharp
sweep
as
if
bent
sideways
by
a
sudden
wind
flew
northward
swiftly
away
and
vanished
the
place
felt
like
a
tomb
there
seemed
no
breath
of
life
left
in
it
despair
laid
hold
upon
him
he
rushed
down
thundering
with
heavy
feet
out
upon
him
darted
the
housekeeper
like
an
and
after
her
came
her
men
but
peter
rushed
past
them
heedless
and
careless
for
had
not
the
princess
mocked
him
and
sped
along
the
road
to
gwyntystorm
what
help
lay
in
a
miner
mattock
a
man

a

heart
he
would
bear
to
his
boy
joan
sat
up
all
night
waiting
his
return
hoping
and
hoping
the
mountain
was
very
still
and
the
sky
was
clear
but
all
night
long
the
miner
sped
northward
and
the
heart
of
his
wife
was
troubled
chapter
the
sacrifice
things
in
the
palace
were
in
a
strange
condition
the
king
playing
with
a
child
and
dreaming
wise
dreams
waited
upon
by
a
little
princess
with
the
heart
of
a
queen
and
a
youth
from
the
mines
who
went
nowhere
not
even
into
the
king
chamber
without
his
mattock
on
his
shoulder
and
a
horrible
animal
at
his
heels
in
a
room
nearby
the
colonel
of
his
guard
also
in
bed
without
a
soldier
to
obey
him
in
six
other
rooms
far
apart
six
miscreants
each
watched
by
a
ministers
to
them

an
old
woman
and
a
page
and
in
the
wine
cellar
animals
creatures
more
grotesque
than
ever
brain
of
man
invented
none
dared
approach
its
gates
and
seldom
one
issued
from
them
all
the
dwellers
in
the
city
were
united
in
enmity
to
the
palace
it
swarmed
with
evil
spirits
they
said
whereas
the
evil
spirits
were
in
the
city
unsuspected
one
consequence
of
their
presence
was
that
when
the
rumour
came
that
a
great
army
was
on
the
march
against
gwyntystorm
instead
of
rushing
to
their
defences
to
make
new
gates
free
portcullises
and
drawbridges
and
bar
the
river
each
band
flew
first
to
their
treasures
burying
them
in
their
cellars
and
gardens
and
hiding
them
behind
stones
in
their
chimneys
and
next
to
rebellion
signing
an
invitation
to
his
majesty
of
borsagrass
to
enter
at
their
open
gates
destroy
their
king
and
annex
their
country
to
his
own
the
straits
of
isolation
were
soon
found
in
the
palace
its
invalids
were
requiring
stronger
food
and
what
was
to
be
done
for
if
the
butchers
sent
meat
to
the
palace
was
it
not
likely
enough
to
be
poisoned
curdie
said
to
derba
he
would
think
of
some
plan
before
morning
but
that
same
night
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
lina
came
to
her
master
and
let
him
understand
she
wanted
to
go
out
he
unlocked
a
little
private
postern
for
her
left
it
so
that
she
could
push
it
open
when
she
returned
and
told
the
crocodile
to
stretch
himself
across
it
inside
before
midnight
she
came
back
with
a
young
deer
early
the
next
morning
the
legserpent
crept
out
of
the
wine
cellar
through
the
broken
door
behind
shot
into
the
river
and
soon
appeared
in
the
kitchen
with
a
splendid
sturgeon
every
night
lina
went
out
hunting
and
every
morning
legserpent
went
out
fishing
and
both
invalids
and
household
had
plenty
to
eat
as
to
news
the
page
in
plain
clothes
would
now
and
then
venture
out
into
the
market
place
and
gather
some
one
night
he
came
back
with
the
report
that
the
army
of
the
king
of
borsagrass
had
crossed
the
border
two
days
after
he
brought
the
news
that
the
enemy
was
now
but
twenty
miles
from
gwyntystorm
the
colonel
of
the
guard
rose
and
began
furbishing
his
armour
but
gave
it
over
to
the
page
and
staggered
across
to
the
barracks
which
were
in
the
next
street
the
sentry
took
him
for
a
ghost
or
worse
ran
into
the
guardroom
bolted
the
door
and
stopped
his
ears
the
poor
colonel
who
was
yet
hardly
able
to
stand
crawled
back
despairing
for
curdie
he
had
already
as
soon
as
the
first
rumour
reached
him
resolved
if
no
other
instructions
came
and
the
king
continued
unable
to
give
orders
to
call
lina
and
the
creatures
and
march
to
meet
the
enemy
if
he
died
he
died
for
the
right
and
there
was
a
right
end
of
it
he
had
no
preparations
to
make
except
a
good
sleep
he
asked
the
king
to
let
the
housemaid
take
his
place
by
his
majesty
that
night
and
went
and
lay
down
on
the
floor
of
the
corridor
no
farther
off
than
a
whisper
would
reach
from
the
door
of
the
chamber
there
with
an
old
mantle
of
the
king
thrown
over
him
he
was
soon
fast
asleep
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
night
he
woke
suddenly
started
to
his
feet
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
could
not
tell
what
had
waked
him
but
could
he
be
awake
or
was
he
not
dreaming
the
curtain
of
the
king
door
a
dull
red
ever
before
was
glowing
a
gorgeous
a
radiant
purple
and
the
crown
wrought
upon
it
in
silks
and
gems
was
flashing
as
if
it
burned
what
could
it
mean
was
the
king
chamber
on
fire
he
darted
to
the
door
and
lifted
the
curtain
glorious
terrible
sight
a
long
and
broad
marble
table
that
stood
at
one
end
of
the
room
had
been
drawn
into
the
middle
of
it
and
thereon
burned
a
great
fire
of
a
sort
that
curdie
knew
a
fire
of
glowing
flaming
roses
red
and
white
in
the
midst
of
the
roses
lay
the
king
moaning
but
motionless
every
rose
that
fell
from
the
table
to
the
floor
someone
whom
curdie
could
not
plainly
see
for
the
brightness
lifted
and
laid
burning
upon
the
king
face
until
at
length
his
face
too
was
covered
with
the
live
roses
and
he
lay
all
within
the
fire
moaning
still
with
now
and
then
a
shuddering
sob
and
the
shape
that
curdie
saw
and
could
not
see
wept
over
the
king
as
he
lay
in
the
fire
and
often
she
hid
her
face
in
handfuls
of
her
shadowy
hair
and
from
her
hair
the
water
of
her
weeping
dropped
like
sunset
rain
in
the
light
of
the
roses
at
last
she
lifted
a
great
armful
of
her
hair
and
shook
it
over
the
fire
and
the
drops
fell
from
it
in
showers
and
they
did
not
hiss
in
the
flames
but
there
arose
instead
as
it
were
the
sound
of
running
brooks
and
the
glow
of
the
red
fire
died
away
and
the
glow
of
the
white
fire
grew
grey
and
the
light
was
gone
and
on
the
table
all
was
black
except
the
face
of
the
king
which
shone
from
under
the
burnt
roses
like
a
diamond
in
the
ashes
of
a
furnace
then
curdie
no
longer
dazzled
saw
and
knew
the
old
princess
the
room
was
lighted
with
the
splendour
of
her
face
of
her
blue
eyes
of
her
sapphire
crown
her
golden
hair
went
streaming
out
from
her
through
the
air
till
it
went
off
in
mist
and
light
she
was
large
and
strong
as
a
titaness
she
stooped
over
the
put
her
mighty
arms
under
the
living
sacrifice
lifted
the
king
as
if
he
were
but
a
little
child
to
her
bosom
walked
with
him
up
the
floor
and
laid
him
in
his
bed
then
darkness
fell
the
miner
boy
turned
silent
away
and
laid
himself
down
again
in
the
corridor
an
absolute
joy
filled
his
heart
his
bosom
his
head
his
whole
body
all
was
safe
all
was
well
with
the
helve
of
his
mattock
tight
in
his
grasp

sank
into

dreamless
sleep

woke
like
a
giant
refreshed
with
wine
when
he
went
into
the
king
chamber
the
housemaid
sat
where
he
had
left
her
and
everything
in
the
room
was
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
save
that
a
heavenly
odour
of
roses
filled
the
air
of
it
he
went
up
to
the
bed
the
king
opened
his
eyes
and
the
soul
of
perfect
health
shone
out
of
them
nor
was
curdie
amazed
in
his
delight
it
not

to
rise

is

in
the
wind
sire
returned
the
colonel

answered
the
king
pointing
to
the
colonel
first
and
then
to
himself

of

and

the

beasts

said
the
king
horses
then
sir
bronzebeard
the
colonel
departed
doubting
sorely
in
his
heart
how
to
accoutre
and
lead
from
the
barrack
stables
three
horses
in
the
teeth
of
his
revolted
regiment
in
the
hall
he
met
the
housemaid
you
lead
a
horse
he
asked
sir

willing
to
die
for
the
king
sir

as
you

keep
on
trying
sir
then
were
i
not
a
man
i
would
be
a
woman
such
as
you
when
they
entered
the
barrack
yard
the
soldiers
scattered
like
autumn
leaves
before
a
blast
of
winter
they
went
into
the
stable
unchallenged
and
lo
in
a
stall
before
the
colonel
eyes
stood
the
king
white
charger
with
the
royal
saddle
and
bridle
hung
high
beside
him
thieves
muttered
the
old
man
in
his
beard
and
went
along
the
stalls
looking
for
his
own
black
charger
having
found
him
he
returned
to
saddle
first
the
king
but
the
maid
had
already
the
saddle
upon
him
and
so
girt
that
the
colonel
could
thrust
no
finger
tip
between
girth
and
skin
he
left
her
to
finish
what
she
had
so
well
begun
and
went
and
made
ready
his
own
he
then
chose
for
the
princess
a
great
red
horse
twenty
years
old
which
he
knew
to
possess
every
equine
virtue
this
and
his
own
he
led
to
the
palace
and
the
maid
led
the
king
the
king
and
curdie
stood
in
the
court
the
king
in
full
armour
of
silvered
steel
with
a
circlet
of
rubies
and
diamonds
round
his
helmet
he
almost
leaped
for
joy
when
he
saw
his
great
white
charger
come
in
gentle
as
a
child
to
the
hand
of
the
housemaid
but
when
the
horse
saw
his
master
in
his
armour
he
reared
and
bounded
in
jubilation
yet
did
not
break
from
the
hand
that
held
him
then
out
came
the
princess
attired
and
ready
with
a
hunting
knife
her
father
had
given
her
by
her
side
they
brought
her
mother
saddle
splendent
with
gems
and
gold
set
it
on
the
great
red
horse
and
lifted
her
to
it
but
the
saddle
was
so
big
and
the
horse
so
tall
that
the
child
found
no
comfort
in
them
king
papa
she
said
i
not
have
my
white
pony
did
not
think
of
him
little
one
said
the
king
is
he
the
stable
answered
the
maid
found
him
half
starved
the
only
horse
within
the
gates
the
day
after
the
servants
were
driven
out
he
has
been
well
fed
since
and
fetch
him
said
the
king
as
the
maid
appeared
with
the
pony
from
a
side
door
came
lina
and
the
following
curdie
will
go
with
curdie
and
the
uglies
cried
the
princess
and
as
soon
as
she
was
mounted
she
got
into
the
middle
of
the
pack
so
out
they
set
the
strangest
force
that
ever
went
against
an
enemy
the
king
in
silver
armour
sat
stately
on
his
white
steed
with
the
stones
flashing
on
his
helmet
beside
him
the
grim
old
colonel
armed
in
steel
rode
his
black
charger
behind
the
king
a
little
to
the
right
curdie
walked
afoot
his
mattock
shining
in
the
sun
lina
followed
at
his
heel
behind
her
came
the
wonderful
company
of
uglies
in
the
midst
of
them
rode
the
gracious
little
irene
dressed
in
blue
and
mounted
on
the
prettiest
of
white
ponies
behind
the
colonel
a
little
to
the
left
walked
the
page
armed
in
a
breastplate
headpiece
and
trooper
sword
he
had
found
in
the
palace
all
much
too
big
for
him
and
carrying
a
huge
brass
trumpet
which
he
did
his
best
to
blow
and
the
king
smiled
and
seemed
pleased
with
his
music
although
it
was
but
the
grunt
of
a
brazen
unrest
alongside
the
beasts
walked
derba
carrying
barbara
their
refuge
the
mountains
should
the
cause
of
the
king
be
lost
as
soon
as
they
were
over
the
river
they
turned
aside
to
ascend
the
cliff
and
there
awaited
the
forging
of
the
day
history
then
first
curdie
saw
that
the
housemaid
whom
they
had
all
forgotten
was
following
mounted
on
the
great
red
horse
and
seated
in
the
royal
saddle
many
were
the
eyes
unfriendly
of
women
that
had
stared
at
them
from
door
and
window
as
they
passed
through
the
city
and
low
laughter
and
mockery
and
evil
words
from
the
lips
of
children
had
rippled
about
their
ears
but
the
men
were
all
gone
to
welcome
the
enemy
the
butchers
the
first
the
king
guard
the
last
and
now
on
the
heels
of
the
king
army
rushed
out
the
women
and
children
also
to
gather
flowers
and
branches
wherewith
to
welcome
their
conquerors
about
a
mile
down
the
river
curdie
happening
to
look
behind
him
saw
the
maid
whom
he
had
supposed
gone
with
derba
still
following
on
the
great
red
horse
the
same
moment
the
king
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
tents
pitched
where
the
cliffs
receding
the
bank
of
the
river
widened
to
a
little
plain
chapter
the
battle
he
commanded
the
page
to
blow
his
trumpet
and
in
the
strength
of
the
moment
the
youth
uttered
a
right
warlike
defiance
but
the
butchers
and
the
guard
who
had
gone
over
armed
to
the
enemy
thinking
that
the
king
had
come
to
make
his
peace
also
and
that
it
might
thereafter
go
hard
with
them
rushed
at
once
to
make
short
work
with
him
and
both
secure
and
commend
themselves
the
butchers
came
on
first
for
the
guards
had
slackened
their
saddle
girths
brandishing
their
knives
and
talking
to
their
dogs
curdie
and
the
page
with
lina
and
her
pack
bounded
to
meet
them
curdie
struck
down
the
foremost
with
his
mattock
the
page
finding
his
sword
too
much
for
him
threw
it
away
and
seized
the
butcher
knife
which
as
he
rose
he
plunged
into
the
foremost
dog
lina
rushed
raging
and
gnashing
among
them
she
would
not
look
at
a
dog
so
long
as
there
was
a
butcher
on
his
legs
and
she
never
stopped
to
kill
a
butcher
only
with
one
grind
of
her
jaws
crushed
a
leg
of
him
when
they
were
all
down
then
indeed
she
flashed
among
the
dogs
meantime
the
king
and
the
colonel
had
spurred
toward
the
advancing
guard
the
king
clove
the
major
through
skull
and
collar
bone
and
the
colonel
stabbed
the
captain
in
the
throat
then
a
fierce
combat
commenced
two
against
many
but
the
butchers
and
their
dogs
quickly
disposed
of
up
came
curdie
and
his
beasts
the
horses
of
the
guard
struck
with
terror
turned
in
spite
of
the
spur
and
fled
in
confusion
thereupon
the
forces
of
borsagrass
which
could
see
little
of
the
affair
but
correctly
imagined
a
small
determined
body
in
front
of
them
hastened
to
the
attack
no
sooner
did
their
first
advancing
wave
appear
through
the
foam
of
the
retreating
one
than
the
king
and
the
colonel
and
the
page
curdie
and
the
beasts
went
charging
upon
them
their
attack
especially
the
rush
of
the
uglies
threw
the
first
line
into
great
confusion
but
the
second
came
up
quickly
the
beasts
could
not
be
everywhere
there
were
thousands
to
one
against
them
and
the
king
and
his
three
companions
were
in
the
greatest
possible
danger
a
dense
cloud
came
over
the
sun
and
sank
rapidly
toward
the
earth
the
cloud
moved
all
together
and
yet
the
thousands
of
white
flakes
of
which
it
was
made
up
moved
each
for
itself
in
ceaseless
and
rapid
motion
those
flakes
were
the
wings
of
pigeons
down
swooped
the
birds
upon
the
invaders
right
in
the
face
of
man
and
horse
they
flew
with
wings
blinding
eyes
and
confounding
brain
horses
reared
and
plunged
and
wheeled
all
was
at
once
in
confusion
the
men
made
frantic
efforts
to
seize
their
tormentors
but
not
one
could
they
touch
and
they
outdoubled
them
in
numbers
between
every
wild
clutch
came
a
peck
of
beak
and
a
buffet
of
pinion
in
the
face
generally
the
bird
would
with
wings
dart
its
whole
body
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
against
its
singled
mark
yet
so
as
to
glance
aloft
the
same
instant
and
descend
skimming
much
as
the
thin
stone
shot
with
horizontal
cast
of
arm
having
touched
and
torn
the
surface
of
the
lake
ascends
to
skim
touch
and
tear
again
so
mingled
the
feathered
multitude
in
the
grim
game
of
war
it
was
a
storm
in
which
the
wind
was
birds
and
the
sea
men
and
ever
as
each
bird
arrived
at
the
rear
of
the
enemy
it
turned
ascended
and
sped
to
the
front
to
charge
again
the
moment
the
battle
began
the
princess
pony
took
fright
and
turned
and
fled
but
the
maid
wheeled
her
horse
across
the
road
and
stopped
him
and
they
waited
together
the
result
of
the
battle
and
as
they
waited
it
seemed
to
the
princess
right
strange
that
the
pigeons
every
one
as
it
came
to
the
rear
and
fetched
a
compass
to
gather
force
for
the
reattack
should
make
the
head
of
her
attendant
on
the
red
horse
the
goal
around
which
it
turned
so
that
about
them
was
an
unintermittent
flapping
and
flashing
of
wings
and
a
curving
sweeping
torrent
of
the
wheeling
bodies
of
birds
strange
also
it
seemed
that
the
maid
should
be
constantly
waving
her
arm
toward
the
battle
and
the
time
of
the
motion
of
her
arm
so
fitted
with
the
rushes
of
birds
that
it
looked
as
if
the
birds
obeyed
her
gesture
and
she
was
casting
living
javelins
by
the
thousand
against
the
enemy
the
moment
a
pigeon
had
rounded
her
head
it
went
off
straight
as
bolt
from
bow
and
with
trebled
velocity
but
of
these
strange
things
others
besides
the
princess
had
taken
note
from
a
rising
ground
whence
they
watched
the
battle
in
growing
dismay
the
leaders
of
the
enemy
saw
the
maid
and
her
motions
and
concluding
her
an
enchantress
whose
were
the
airy
legions
humiliating
them
set
spurs
to
their
horses
made
a
circuit
outflanked
the
king
and
came
down
upon
her
but
suddenly
by
her
side
stood
a
stalwart
old
man
in
the
garb
of
a
miner
who
as
the
general
rode
at
her
sword
in
hand
heaved
his
swift
mattock
and
brought
it
down
with
such
force
on
the
forehead
of
his
charger
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
log
his
rider
shot
over
his
head
and
lay
stunned
had
not
the
great
red
horse
reared
and
wheeled
he
would
have
fallen
beneath
that
of
the
general
with
lifted
sabre
one
of
his
attendant
officers
rode
at
the
miner
but
a
mass
of
pigeons
darted
in
the
faces
of
him
and
his
horse
and
the
next
moment
he
lay
beside
his
commander
the
rest
of
them
turned
and
fled
pursued
by
the
birds
friend
peter
said
the
maid
hast
come
as
i
told
thee
welcome
and
thanks
by
this
time
the
battle
was
over
the
rout
was
general
the
enemy
stormed
back
upon
their
own
camp
with
the
beasts
roaring
in
the
midst
of
them
and
the
king
and
his
army
now
reinforced
by
one
pursuing
but
presently
the
king
drew
rein
off
your
hounds
curdie
and
let
the
pigeons
do
the
rest
he
shouted
and
turned
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
princess
in
full
panic
fled
the
invaders
sweeping
down
their
tents
stumbling
over
their
baggage
trampling
on
their
dead
and
wounded
ceaselessly
pursued
and
buffeted
by
the
army
of
heaven
homeward
they
rushed
the
road
they
had
come
straight
for
the
borders
many
dropping
from
pure
fatigue
and
lying
where
they
fell
and
still
the
pigeons
were
in
their
necks
as
they
ran
at
length
to
the
eyes
of
the
king
and
his
army
nothing
was
visible
save
a
dust
cloud
below
and
a
bird
cloud
above
before
night
the
bird
cloud
came
back
flying
high
over
gwyntystorm
sinking
swiftly
it
disappeared
among
the
ancient
roofs
of
the
palace
chapter
judgement
the
king
and
his
army
returned
bringing
with
them
one
prisoner
only
the
lord
chancellor
curdie
had
dragged
him
from
under
a
fallen
tent
not
by
the
hand
of
a
man
but
by
the
foot
of
a
mule
when
they
entered
the
city
it
was
still
as
the
grave
the
citizens
had
fled
home
must
submit
they
cried
the
king
and
his
demons
will
destroy
us
the
king
rode
through
the
streets
in
silence
with
his
people
but
he
stopped
his
horse
in
the
midst
of
the
market
place
and
called
in
a
voice
loud
and
clear
as
the
cry
of
a
silver
trumpet
and
find
your
own
bury
your
dead
and
bring
home
your
wounded
then
he
turned
him
gloomily
to
the
palace
just
as
they
reached
the
gates
peter
who
as
they
went
had
been
telling
his
tale
to
curdie
ended
it
with
the
words
so
there
i
was
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
the
two
princesses
two
princesses
father
the
one
on
the
great
red
horse
was
the
housemaid
said
curdie
and
ran
to
open
the
gates
for
the
king
they
found
derba
returned
before
them
and
already
busy
preparing
them
food
the
king
put
up
his
charger
with
his
own
hands
rubbed
him
down
and
fed
him
when
they
had
washed
and
eaten
and
drunk
he
called
the
colonel
and
told
curdie
and
the
page
to
bring
out
the
traitors
and
the
beasts
and
attend
him
to
the
market
place
by
this
time
the
people
were
crowding
back
into
the
city
bearing
their
dead
and
wounded
and
there
was
lamentation
in
gwyntystorm
for
no
one
could
comfort
himself
and
no
one
had
any
to
comfort
him
the
nation
was
victorious
but
the
people
were
conquered
the
king
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
market
place
upon
the
steps
of
the
ancient
cross
he
had
laid
aside
his
helmet
and
put
on
his
crown
but
he
stood
all
armed
beside
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
he
called
the
people
to
him
and
for
all
the
terror
of
the
beasts
they
dared
not
disobey
him
those
even
who
were
carrying
their
wounded
laid
them
down
and
drew
near
trembling
then
the
king
said
to
curdie
and
the
page
the
evil
men
before
me
he
looked
upon
them
for
a
moment
in
mingled
anger
and
pity
then
turned
to
the
people
and
said
your
trust
ye
slaves
behold
your
leaders
i
would
have
freed
you
but
ye
would
not
be
free
now
shall
ye
be
ruled
with
a
rod
of
iron
that
ye
may
learn
what
freedom
is
and
love
it
and
seek
it
these
wretches
i
will

they
shall

no
longer
he
made
a
sign
to
curdie
who
immediately
brought
up
the
legserpent
to
the
body
of
the
animal
they
bound
the
lord
chamberlain
speechless
with
horror
the
butler
began
to
shriek
and
pray
but
they
bound
him
on
the
back
of
clubhead
one
after
another
upon
the
largest
of
the
creatures
they
bound
the
whole
seven
each
through
the
unveiling
terror
looking
the
villain
he
was
then
said
the
king
thank
you
my
good
beasts
and
i
hope
to
visit
you
ere
long
take
these
evil
men
with
you
and
go
to
your
place
like
a
whirlwind
they
were
in
the
crowd
scattering
it
like
dust
like
hounds
they
rushed
from
the
city
their
burdens
howling
and
raving
what
became
of
them
i
have
never
heard
then
the
king
turned
once
more
to
the
people
and
said
to
your
houses
nor
vouchsafed
them
another
word
they
crept
home
like
chidden
hounds
the
king
returned
to
the
palace
he
made
the
colonel
a
duke
and
the
page
a
knight
and
peter
he
appointed
general
of
all
his
mines
but
to
curdie
he
said
are
my
own
boy
curdie
my
child
can
not
choose
but
love
you
and
when
you
are
grown
up
if
you
both
will
you
shall
marry
each
other
and
be
king
and
queen
when
i
am
gone
till
then
be
the
king
curdie
irene
held
out
her
arms
to
curdie
he
raised
her
in
his
and
she
kissed
him
my
curdie
too
she
said
thereafter
the
people
called
him
prince
conrad
but
the
king
always
called
him
either
just
curdie
or
my
miner
boy
they
sat
down
to
supper
and
derba
and
the
knight
and
the
housemaid
waited
and
barbara
sat
at
the
king
left
hand
the
housemaid
poured
out
the
wine
and
as
she
poured
for
curdie
red
wine
that
foamed
in
the
cup
as
if
glad
to
see
the
light
whence
it
had
been
banished
so
long
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
curdie
started
and
sprang
from
his
seat
and
dropped
on
his
knees
and
burst
into
tears
and
the
maid
said
with
a
smile
such
as
none
but
one
could
smile
i
not
tell
you
curdie
that
it
might
be
you
would
not
know
me
when
next
you
saw
me
then
she
went
from
the
room
and
in
a
moment
returned
in
royal
purple
with
a
crown
of
diamonds
and
rubies
from
under
which
her
hair
went
flowing
to
the
floor
all
about
her
feet
her
face
was
radiant
with
joy
the
joy
overshadowed
by
a
faint
mist
as
of
unfulfilment
the
king
rose
and
kneeled
on
one
knee
before
her
all
kneeled
in
like
homage
then
the
king
would
have
yielded
her
his
royal
chair
but
she
made
them
all
sit
down
and
with
her
own
hands
placed
at
the
table
seats
for
derba
and
the
page
then
in
ruby
crown
and
royal
purple
she
served
them
all
chapter
the
end
the
king
sent
curdie
out
into
his
dominions
to
search
for
men
and
women
that
had
human
hands
and
many
such
he
found
honest
and
true
and
brought
them
to
his
master
so
a
new
and
upright
court
was
formed
and
strength
returned
to
the
nation
but
the
exchequer
was
almost
empty
for
the
evil
men
had
squandered
everything
and
the
king
hated
taxes
unwillingly
paid
then
came
curdie
and
said
to
the
king
that
the
city
stood
upon
gold
and
the
king
sent
for
men
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
earth
and
they
built
smelting
furnaces
and
peter
brought
miners
and
they
mined
the
gold
and
smelted
it
and
the
king
coined
it
into
money
and
therewith
established
things
well
in
the
land
the
same
day
on
which
he
found
his
boy
peter
set
out
to
go
home
when
he
told
the
good
news
to
joan
his
wife
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
said
us
go
and
they
left
the
cottage
and
repaired
to
gwyntystorm
and
on
a
mountain
above
the
city
they
built
themselves
a
warm
house
for
their
old
age
high
in
the
clear
air
as
peter
mined
one
day
at
the
back
of
the
king
wine
cellar
he
broke
into
a
cavern
crusted
with
gems
and
much
wealth
flowed
therefrom
and
the
king
used
it
wisely
queen
irene
that
was
the
right
name
of
the
old
princess
was
thereafter
seldom
long
absent
from
the
palace
once
or
twice
when
she
was
missing
barbara
who
seemed
to
know
of
her
sometimes
when
nobody
else
had
a
notion
whither
she
had
gone
said
she
was
with
the
dear
old
uglies
in
the
wood
curdie
thought
that
perhaps
her
business
might
be
with
others
there
as
well
all
the
uppermost
rooms
in
the
palace
were
left
to
her
use
and
when
any
one
was
in
need
of
her
help
up
thither
he
must
go
but
even
when
she
was
there
he
did
not
always
succeed
in
finding
her
she
however
always
knew
that
such
a
one
had
been
looking
for
her
curdie
went
to
find
her
one
day
as
he
ascended
the
last
stair
to
meet
him
came
the
scent
of
her
roses
and
when
he
opened
the
door
lo
there
was
the
same
gorgeous
room
in
which
his
touch
had
been
glorified
by
her
fire
and
there
burned
the
fire
a
huge
heap
of
red
and
white
roses
before
the
hearth
stood
the
princess
an
old
woman
with
lina
a
little
behind
her
slowly
wagging
her
tail
and
looking
like
a
beast
of
prey
that
can
hardly
so
long
restrain
itself
from
springing
as
to
be
sure
of
its
victim
the
queen
was
casting
roses
more
and
more
roses
upon
the
fire
at
last
she
turned
and
said
lina
and
lina
dashed
burrowing
into
the
fire
there
went
up
a
black
smoke
and
a
dust
and
lina
was
never
more
seen
in
the
palace
irene
and
curdie
were
married
the
old
king
died
and
they
were
king
and
queen
as
long
as
they
lived
gwyntystorm
was
a
better
city
and
good
people
grew
in
it
but
they
had
no
children
and
when
they
died
the
people
chose
a
king
and
the
new
king
went
mining
and
mining
in
the
rock
under
the
city
and
grew
more
and
more
eager
after
the
gold
and
paid
less
and
less
heed
to
his
people
rapidly
they
sank
toward
their
old
wickedness
but
still
the
king
went
on
mining
and
coining
gold
by
the
pailful
until
the
people
were
worse
even
than
in
the
old
time
and
so
greedy
was
the
king
after
gold
that
when
at
last
the
ore
began
to
fail
he
caused
the
miners
to
reduce
the
pillars
which
peter
and
they
that
followed
him
had
left
standing
to
bear
the
city
and
from
the
girth
of
an
oak
of
a
thousand
years
they
chipped
them
down
to
that
of
a
fir
tree
of
fifty
one
day
at
noon
when
life
was
at
its
highest
the
whole
city
fell
with
a
roaring
crash
the
cries
of
men
and
the
shrieks
of
women
went
up
with
its
dust
and
then
there
was
a
great
silence
where
the
mighty
rock
once
towered
crowded
with
homes
and
crowned
with
a
palace
now
rushes
and
raves
a
rapid
of
the
river
all
around
spreads
a
wilderness
of
wild
deer
and
the
very
name
of
gwyntystorm
had
ceased
from
the
lips
of
men
