state
your

frontis
he
transferred
his
attention
to
the
door
grace
you
have
misunderstood
me
an
old
man
was
looking
up
at
the
face
of
a
young
girl
she
was
ignorant
of
his
presence
the
door
opened
and
philip

official
he
was

chapter
i
you
know
what
would
happen
to
him
now
state
your
problem
the
man
who
was
thus
addressed
shifted
uneasily
on
the
long
bench
which
he
and
his
companion
bestrode
he
was
facing
the
speaker
and
though
very
little
light
sifted
through
the
window
high
over
their
heads
he
realized
that
what
there
was
fell
on
his
features
and
he
was
not
sure
of
his
features
or
of
what
effect
their
expression
might
have
on
the
other
man
are
you
sure
we
are
quite
alone
in
this
big
desolate
place
he
asked
it
seemed
a
needless
question
though
it
was
broad
daylight
outside
and
they
were
in
the
very
heart
of
the
most
populated
district
of
lower
new
york
they
could
not
have
been
more
isolated
had
the
surrounding
walls
been
those
of
some
old
ruin
in
the
heart
of
an
untraversed
desert
a
short
description
of
the
place
will
explain
this
they
were
in
the
forsaken
old
church
not
far
from
avenue
a
a
building
long
given
over
to
desolation
and
empty
of
everything
but
d√©bris
and
one
or
two
broken
stalls
which
for
some
inscrutable
reason
possibly
from
some
latent
instinct
of
inherited
reverence
had
not
yet
been
converted
into
junk
and
sold
to
the
old
clothes
men
by
the
rapacious
denizens
of
the
surrounding
tenements
perhaps
you
remember
this
building
perhaps
some
echo
of
the
bygone
and
romantic
has
come
to
you
as
you
passed
its
decaying
walls
once
dedicated
to
worship
but
soulless
now
and
only
distinguishable
from
the
tenements
pressing
up
on
either
side
by
its
one
high
window
in
which
some
bits
of
colored
glass
still
lingered
amid
its
twisted
and
battered
network
you
may
remember
the
building
and
you
may
remember
the
stray
glimpses
afforded
you
through
the
arched
opening
in
the
lower
story
of
one
of
the
adjacent
tenements
of
the
churchyard
in
its
rear
with
its
chipped
and
tumbling
just
showing
here
and
there
above
the
accumulated
litter
but
it
is
not
probable
that
you
have
any
recollections
of
the
interior
of
the
church
itself
shut
as
it
has
been
from
the
eye
of
the
public
for
nearly
a
generation
and
it
is
with
the
interior
we
have
to
do
a
great
hollow
vault
where
once
altar
and
priest
confronted
a
reverent
congregation
there
is
no
altar
here
now
nor
any
chancel
hardly
any
floor
the
timbers
which
held
the
pews
have
rotted
and
fallen
away
and
what
was
once
a
cellar
has
received
all
this
rubbish
and
held
it
piled
up
in
mounds
which
have
blocked
up
most
of
the
windows
and
robbed
the
place
even
of
the
dim
religious
light
which
was
once
its
glory
so
that
when
the
man
whose
words
we
have
just
quoted
asked
if
they
were
quite
alone
and
peered
into
the
dim
belumbered
corners
it
was
but
natural
for
his
hardy
resolute
and
unscrupulous
companion
to
snort
with
impatience
and
disgust
as
he
answered
would
i
have
brought
you
here
if
i
had
known
it
was
the
safest
place
in
new
york
for
this
kind
of
talk
why
man
there
may
be
in
this
city
five
men
all
told
who
know
the
trick
of
the
door
i
unfastened
for
you
and
not
one
of
them
is
a
cop
you
may
take
my
word
for
that
besides
but
the
kids
they
everywhere
and
if
one
of
them
should
have
followed
us
do
you
know
what
would
happen
to
him
i
tell
you
a
story
no
i
wo
you
frightened
enough
already
but
there
no
kid
here
nor
any
one
else
but
our
two
selves
unless
it
be
some
wandering
spook
from
the
congregations
laid
outside
and
spooks
do
count
so
out
with
your
proposition
fellows
i
chapter
ii
in
that
no
names
hoarsely
interrupted
the
other
if
you
speak
my
name
again
i
give
the
whole
thing
up
no
you
wo
you
too
deep
in
it
for
that
but
i
drop
the
fellows
and
just
call
you
sam
if
that
too
familiar
we
drop
the
job
not
so
keen
on
it
you
will
be
it
right
in
your
line
sam
fellows
as
he
was
called
was
whispering
now
a
hot
eager
whisper
breathing
of
guilt
and
desperation
if
i
could
do
it
alone
but
i
have
the
wit
the
experience
dryly
put
in
the
other
well
well
he
exclaimed
impatiently
as
fellows
crept
nearer
but
said
nothing
i
going
to
speak
but
well
then
here
how
it
is
he
suddenly
conceded
warned
by
the
other
eye
the
building
is
a
one
chuck
full
and
alive
with
business
the
room
i
mean
is
on
the
twelfth
floor
it
is
one
of
five
all
communicating
and
all
in
constant
use
except
the
one
holding
the
safe
and
that
is
visited
constantly
some
one
is
always
going
in
and
out
indeed
it
is
a
rule
of
the
firm
that
every
one
of
the
employees
must
go
into
that
room
once
at
least
during
the
day
and
remain
there
for
five
minutes
alone
i
do
it
every
one
does
it
it
a
very
mysterious
proceeding
which
only
a
crank
like
my
employer
would
devise
what
do
you
do
there
nothing
i
speaking
now
for
myself
the
others
some
of
the
others
of
the
others
may
open
the
safe
that
what
i
believe
that
what
i
want
to
know
about
and
it
there
are
thousands
in
that
safe
and
the
old
man
being
away
yes
this
is
all
very
interesting
go
on
what
you
want
is
an
artist
with
a
jimmy
no
no
it
no
such
job
as
that
i
want
to
know
the
person
the
trusted
person
who
has
all
those
securities
within
touch
it
a
mania
with
me
i
should
have
been
the
man
i
i
the
hoarseness
with
which
this
word
was
uttered
the
instinct
of
shame
which
made
his
eyes
fall
as
it
struggled
from
his
lips
wakened
a
curious
little
gleam
of
hardy
cynicism
in
the
steady
gaze
of
his
listener
oh
you
manager
are
you
came
in
slow
retort
filling
a
silence
that
had
more
of
pain
than
pleasure
in
it
well
manager
your
story
is
very
interesting
but
by
no
means
complete
suppose
you
hurry
on
to
the
next
instalment
cringing
as
from
a
blow
fellows
took
up
his
tale
no
longer
creeping
nearer
his
confederate
but
if
anything
edging
away
chapter
iii
does
it
i
watched
and
watched
and
watched
said
he
but
i
ca
pick
out
the
man
letters
come
orders
are
given
and
those
orders
are
carried
out
but
by
i
speaking
now
of
investments
or
the
payment
of
large
sums
anything
which
calls
for
the
opening
of
that
safe
where
the
old
man
has
stuffed
away
his
thousands
small
matters
fall
to
my
share
there
is
another
safe
of
which
i
hold
the
combination
child
play
but
the
other
it
would
make
both
of
us
independent
and
yet
leave
something
for
appearances
but
it
ca
be
worked
it
stands
in
front
of
a
glass
door
from
which
the
curtain
is
drawn
every
night
every
passerby
can
look
in
if
it
is
opened
it
must
be
done
in
broad
daylight
and
by
the
person
whom
the
old
man
trusts
by
that
means
only
would
i
get
my
revenge
and
revenge
is
what
i
want
he
do
trust
me
who
have
been
with
him
for
seven
years
and
drop
that
it
is
interesting
the
facts
are
what
i
want
what
kind
of
safe
is
it
the
strangest
you
ever
saw
i
do
know
who
made
it
there
nothing
on
it
to
show
nor
is
there
a
lock
or
combination
but
it
opens
you
can
just
see
the
outline
of
a
door
steel
fine
steel
and
not
so
very
large
but
the
contents
we
take
its
contents
for
granted
how
does
it
stand
on
a
platform
yes
one
foot
from
the
floor
the
platform
runs
all
the
way
across
the
room
and
holds
other
things
a
table
which
nobody
uses
a
revolving
bookcase
and
a
series
of
shelves
fitted
with
boxes
containing
old
receipts
and
such
junk
sometimes
i
go
through
these
but
nothing
ever
comes
of
it
he
paused
as
if
the
subject
were
distasteful
and
the
safe
is
opened
almost
every
week
i
ashamed
to
tell
you
the
old
duffer
methods
they
loony
but
he
is
a
lunatic
at
any
rate
they
do
think
so
in
wall
street
i
make
a
guess
at
his
name
not
yet
you
have
to
swear
oh
we
both
in
it
never
mind
the
heroics
it
too
good
a
thing
to
peach
on
me
and
the
manager
i
like
that
take
it
easy
till
the
done
anyway
and
now
i
take
a
fly
at
the
name
it
he
had
the
grace
to
whisper
chapter
iv
must
be
young
fellows
squirmed
and
turned
a
shade
paler
if
one
could
trust
the
sickly
violet
ray
that
shot
down
from
the
once
exquisitely
colored
window
high
up
over
their
heads
hush
he
muttered
and
the
other
grinned
evidently
the
guess
was
a
correct
one
no
he
no
lunatic
the
professional
quietly
declared
but
he
has
queer
ways
which
of
his
queers
do
you
object
to
when
his
letters
come
or
more
often
his
cablegrams
they
are
opened
by
me
and
then
put
in
plain
view
on
a
certain
little
bulletin
board
in
the
main
office
these
are
his
orders
any
one
who
knows
the
cipher
can
read
them
i
do
know
the
cipher
at
night
i
take
them
down
number
them
and
file
them
away
they
have
served
their
purpose
they
have
been
seen
by
the
person
whose
business
it
is
to
carry
out
his
instructions
and
the
rest
you
must
guess
his
brokers
know
the
secret
but
it
is
never
discussed
by
us
the
least
word
and
the
next
cablegram
would
read
in
good
plain
english
him
i
had
that
experience
i
had
to
fire
three
since
he
went
away
two
months
ago
that
good
why
good
that
cuts
out
three
from
your
list
person
is
not
among
the
ones
that
so
new
life
seemed
to
spring
up
in
fellows
you
do
the
job
he
cried
somehow
i
never
thought
of
going
about
it
that
way
and
i
know
another
man
that
out
who
myself
for
one
there
are
only
seven
more
counting
all
all
stenographers
included
oh
stenographers
stenographers
must
be
counted
well
then
seven
men
and
one
woman
our
stenographer
is
a
woman
what
kind
of
a
woman
a
young
girl
ordinary
but
good
enough
i
never
noticed
her
very
much
tell
me
about
the
men
what
the
use
you
would
take
my
word
they
a
cheap
lot
beneath
contempt
in
my
estimation
there
not
one
of
them
clever
enough
for
the
business
jack
forbush
comes
the
nearest
to
it
and
probably
is
the
one
the
way
he
keeps
his
eye
on
me
makes
me
suspect
him
or
is
he
too
playing
my
game
how
can
i
tell
how
can
i
tell
anything
from
what
you
say
i
have
to
look
into
the
matter
myself
give
me
the
names
and
addresses
and
look
the
parties
up
get
their
rating
so
to
speak
leave
it
to
me
and
i
land
the
old
man
confidential
clerk
here
the
list
i
thought
you
might
want
it
where
the
girl
name
the
girl
oh
pshaw
put
her
name
down
just
the
same
there
then
grace
lee
address
east
street
and
now
swear
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
beau
johnson
pulled
the
rim
of
fellows
hat
over
his
eyes
to
suggest
what
he
thought
of
this
demand
chapter
v
business
with
next
day
there
appeared
at
the
offices
of
thomas
stoughton
in
nassau
street
a
trim
man
who
had
urgent
business
with
fellows
the
manager
he
was
kept
waiting
for
some
time
before
being
introduced
into
that
gentleman
private
room
but
this
did
not
seem
to
disturb
him
there
was
plenty
to
look
at
or
so
he
seemed
to
think
and
his
keen
noncommittal
eyes
flashed
hither
and
thither
and
from
face
to
face
with
restless
activity
he
seemed
particularly
interested
in
the
bookkeeper
of
the
establishment
but
it
was
an
interest
which
did
not
last
long
and
when
a
neat
young
woman
rose
from
her
seat
and
passed
rapidly
across
the
room
it
was
upon
her
his
eyes
settled
and
remained
fixed
with
a
growing
attention
until
a
certain
door
closed
upon
her
with
a
sound
like
a
snapping
lock
then
he
transferred
his
attention
to
the
door
and
was
still
gazing
at
it
when
a
boy
summoned
him
to
the
manager
office
he
went
in
with
reluctance
he
had
rather
have
watched
that
door
but
he
had
questions
to
ask
and
so
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
fellows
was
not
pleased
to
see
him
he
started
quite
guiltily
from
his
seat
and
only
sat
again
on
compulsion
the
compulsion
of
his
visitor
steady
and
quelling
eye
i
business
with
you
mr
fellows
then
the
boy
being
gone
which
is
the
room
the
one
opening
out
of
the
general
office
directly
opposite
this
illustration
transferred
his
attention
to
the
fellows
nodded
i
have
just
seen
one
of
the
employees
go
in
there
i
should
like
to
see
that
person
come
out
do
you
mind
talking
with
this
door
open
i
know
enough
about
banking
to
hold
up
my
end
of
the
conversation
fellows
rose
with
a
jerk
and
pushed
the
door
back
his
visitor
smiled
easily
and
launched
into
a
discussion
about
stocks
and
bonds
interspersed
with
a
few
assertions
and
questions
not
meant
for
the
general
ear
as
the
girl
who
is
in
there
not
ordinary
by
any
means
just
the
sort
an
old
smudge
like
stoughton
would
be
apt
to
trust
now
that
she
often
sings
i
forbidden
it
but
she
forgets
she
answered
fellows
good
music
listen
to
that
note
high
as
a
prima
donna
does
she
sing
at
her
work
i
fire
her
if
she
did
it
only
when
she
walking
about
or
in
that
room
at
par
i
buy
nothing
at
par
she
coming
i
wish
i
dared
intercept
her
rifle
her
pockets
do
you
know
if
she
has
pockets
how
should
i
you
not
worth
your
salt
ah
there
a
face
for
you
and
i
can
read
it
like
a
book
did
a
letter
or
cablegram
come
did
you
see
it
hung
up
in
the
outer
thought
i
saw
that
a
quotation
worth
listening
to
three
at
girl
a
trump
i
will
see
more
of
my
here
he
took
care
to
shut
the
door
i
been
the
rounds
fellows
work
and
all
that
she
is
the
only
puzzler
among
the
group
you
hear
from
me
again
meanwhile
treat
the
girl
well
do
spring
any
traps
leave
that
to
me
and
fellows
panting
with
excitement
promised
muttering
under
his
breath
a
woman
that
even
worse
than
i
thought
but
we
make
the
old
fellow
pay
for
it
those
securities
are
ours
i
already
feel
them
in
my
hand
the
sinister
twitch
which
marred
the
other
mouth
emphasized
the
assertion
in
a
way
grace
lee
friends
would
have
trembled
to
see
chapter
vi
i
could
tell
you
his
that
evening
a
young
woman
and
a
young
man
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
in
central
park
they
were
holding
hands
but
modestly
and
with
a
clinging
affection
no
one
appeared
in
sight
they
had
the
the
fragrance
of
the
spring
foliage
and
their
true
love
all
to
themselves
the
woman
was
grace
the
young
man
was
philip
andrews
a
fellow
whom
any
girl
might
be
proud
to
be
seen
with
much
more
to
be
engaged
to
grace
was
proud
but
she
was
more
than
that
her
heart
was
all
involved
in
her
hope
a
good
heart
which
he
was
equally
proud
to
have
won
yet
while
love
was
theirs
and
the
surroundings
breathed
peace
and
joy
they
did
not
look
quite
happy
a
cloud
was
on
his
brow
and
something
like
a
tear
in
her
eye
as
she
spoke
gently
but
with
rare
firmness
philip
we
must
wait
one
love
does
not
put
out
another
i
can
not
leave
my
old
father
now
he
is
too
feeble
and
much
too
dependent
on
me
philip
you
do
not
know
my
father
you
have
seen
him
it
is
true
many
many
times
you
have
talked
with
him
and
even
have
nursed
him
at
odd
moments
when
i
had
to
be
out
of
the
room
getting
supper
or
supplying
some
of
his
many
wants
yet
you
do
not
know
him
i
know
that
he
is
intelligent
yes
yes
that
is
evident
any
one
can
see
that
and
you
can
see
too
that
he
is
frequently
fretful
and
exacting
as
all
old
people
are
but
the
qualities
he
shows
me
his
strong
melancholy
but
devoted
nature
quickened
by
an
unusually
unhappy
life
that
you
do
not
see
and
can
not
much
as
you
like
him
and
much
as
he
likes
you
only
the
child
who
has
surprised
him
at
odd
moments
when
he
thought
himself
quite
alone
wringing
his
hands
and
weeping
over
some
intolerable
memory
who
has
listened
in
the
dead
of
night
to
his
smothered
but
groans
can
know
either
his
suffering
or
the
one
joy
which
palliates
it
if
i
could
tell
you
his
story
but
that
would
be
treason
to
one
whose
rights
i
am
bound
to
reverence
you
will
respect
my
silence
but
you
must
also
take
my
word
that
he
needs
and
has
a
right
to
all
the
pleasure
and
all
the
hope
my
love
can
give
him
i
can
not
be
with
him
much
my
work
forbids
but
the
little
time
i
have
is
his
except
on
rare
occasions
like
this
and
he
knows
it
and
is
satisfied
were
i
married
but
you
will
wait
philip
it
may
not
be
long
he
grows
weaker
every
day
besides
you
are
not
ready
yet
yourself
you
are
doing
wonderfully
well
but
a
year
freedom
will
help
you
materially
as
it
will
me
every
day
is
adding
to
our
store
in
a
year
we
may
be
almost
independent
grace
you
have
misunderstood
me
i
said
that
i
was
no
good
without
you
that
i
needed
your
presence
to
make
a
man
of
me
but
i
did
not
mean
that
you
were
to
share
my
fortunes
now
i
would
not
ask
that
i
would
be
a
fool
or
worse
for
grace
i
not
doing
so
well
as
you
think
while
i
knew
that
my
present
employment
was
for
a
specified
time
i
had
hopes
of
continuing
on
but
this
can
not
be
that
what
i
have
to
tell
you
it
looks
as
if
our
marriage
would
have
to
be
postponed
indefinitely
instead
of
hastened
and
i
ca
bear
it
you
do
know
what
you
are
to
me
or
what
this
disappointment
is
i
expected
to
be
raised
not
dismissed
and
if
i
had
had
illustration
you
have
misunderstood
what
the
word
came
very
softly
and
with
rare
tenderness
it
made
him
turn
and
look
at
her
sweet
upturned
face
with
its
resources
of
strength
and
shy
unfathomable
smile
what
she
asked
again
with
a
closer
pressure
of
her
hand
you
must
finish
all
your
sentences
with
i
ashamed
he
uttered
it
breathlessly
what
am
i
to
say
i
had
three
thousand
dollars
the
stickney
company
would
keep
me
i
have
barely
three
hundred
and
those
are
dedicated
to
you
chapter
vii
sure
that
i
can
get
them
for
if
you
had
she
repeated
it
in
surprise
and
yet
with
an
indescribable
air
which
to
one
versed
in
human
nature
would
have
caught
the
attention
and
aroused
strange
inner
inquiries
does
the
stickney
company
want
money
so
badly
as
that
that
not
it
they
have
plainly
told
me
that
for
three
thousand
dollars
and
my
services
they
would
give
me
ten
thousand
dollars
stock
interest
but
insist
that
the
man
who
assumes
the
responsibility
of
the
position
must
be
financially
interested
as
well
but
i
have
the
money
and
without
the
money
my
experience
appears
to
them
valueless
i
despair
of
getting
another
situation
in
these
hard
times
and
grace
you
do
look
sorry
because
she
paused
and
her
fine
eyes
roamed
about
her
jealous
of
a
listener
to
her
secret
but
did
not
pierce
the
bush
which
rose
up
cloudy
with
blossoms
a
few
feet
behind
their
bench
because
it
is
not
impossible
for
you
to
hope
for
those
thousands
i
think
i
am
sure
that
i
can
get
them
for
you
her
voice
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
but
it
was
a
very
clear
whisper
young
andrews
looked
at
her
in
surprise
there
was
something
besides
pleasure
in
that
surprise
where
he
asked
she
hesitated
and
just
at
that
moment
the
moon
slipped
behind
a
cloud
where
grace
can
you
get
three
thousand
dollars
from
stoughton
he
is
generous
to
you
he
pays
you
well
for
what
you
do
for
him
but
i
do
not
think
he
would
give
you
that
amount
nor
do
i
think
he
would
risk
it
on
any
venture
involving
my
judgment
i
should
not
like
to
have
you
ask
him
i
should
like
to
rise
feeling
absolutely
independent
of
mr
stoughton
i
never
thought
of
asking
him
there
is
another
way
i
i
like
to
think
it
over
if
your
scheme
is
good
good
i
might
be
brought
to
aid
you
in
the
way
my
mind
suggests
but
i
should
want
to
be
sure
she
was
not
looking
at
him
now
if
she
had
been
she
might
have
been
startled
at
his
expression
nor
could
he
see
her
face
she
had
turned
it
aside
grace
he
prayed
do
do
anything
rash
you
handle
so
much
money
that
three
thousand
dollars
may
seem
very
little
to
you
but
it
a
goodly
sum
to
get
or
to
replace
if
one
loses
it
you
must
not
borrow
i
will
not
borrow
nor
raise
it
in
any
way
without
telling
me
the
sacrifice
you
must
make
to
obtain
it
but
it
all
a
dream
tell
me
that
it
all
a
dream
you
were
talking
from
your
wishes
not
from
any
certainty
you
have
say
so
and
i
will
not
be
disappointed
i
do
not
want
money
i
rather
go
poor
and
wait
till
the
times
change
do
you
see
i
be
more
of
a
man
but
you
have
to
take
it
if
i
gave
it
to
you
and
perhaps
i
shall
i
want
to
see
you
happy
philip
i
must
see
you
happy
i
be
willing
to
risk
a
good
deal
for
that
i
not
so
happy
myself
father
suffers
so
and
the
care
of
it
weighs
on
me
you
are
all
i
have
to
make
me
glad
and
when
you
are
troubled
my
heart
goes
down
down
but
it
getting
late
dear
it
time
we
went
home
do
ask
me
what
in
my
mind
but
dream
of
riches
i
sure
they
will
come
you
shall
earn
them
with
the
three
thousand
dollars
you
want
and
which
i
will
give
you
i
shall
earn
them
honestly
were
the
last
words
he
said
as
they
rose
from
the
seat
and
began
to
move
toward
the
gate
and
the
moon
coming
out
from
its
temporary
eclipse
shone
on
his
face
as
he
said
this
but
not
on
her
bowed
head
and
sidelong
look
they
were
in
the
shadow
there
was
something
else
in
the
shadow
as
they
moved
away
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
the
long
slim
figure
of
a
man
rose
from
behind
the
bush
i
have
mentioned
he
had
a
sparkling
eye
and
a
mouth
and
he
smiled
very
curiously
as
he
looked
after
the
pair
before
turning
himself
about
and
going
the
other
way
it
was
not
fellows
it
was
his
chosen
confederate
in
the
nefarious
scheme
they
had
planned
between
them
chapter
viii
did
as
you
bid
another
meeting
in
the
old
church
but
this
time
at
night
the
somberness
of
the
surroundings
was
undiminished
by
any
light
they
were
in
absolute
darkness
absolute
darkness
but
not
absolute
silence
noises
strange
and
suggestive
but
not
of
any
human
agency
whispered
sighed
rattled
and
grumbled
from
far
away
recesses
the
snap
of
wood
the
gnawing
of
rats
the
rustling
of
bat
wings
disturbed
the
ears
of
one
of
the
guilty
pair
till
his
voice
took
on
unnatural
tones
as
he
tried
to
tell
his
story
to
his
greedy
companion
they
were
again
astride
the
bench
and
their
thin
faces
were
so
near
that
their
breaths
commingled
at
times
yet
fellows
felt
at
moments
so
doubtful
of
all
human
presence
that
instinctively
his
hand
would
go
groping
out
till
it
touched
the
other
arm
or
breast
when
it
would
fall
back
again
satisfied
he
was
in
a
state
of
absolute
terror
of
the
darkness
the
oppressive
air
the
ghostly
sounds
and
possibly
of
the
image
raised
by
his
own
conscience
yet
he
hugged
to
himself
the
thought
of
secrecy
which
it
all
involved
and
never
thought
of
yielding
up
his
scheme
or
even
shortening
his
tale
so
long
as
the
other
listened
and
gave
his
mind
to
the
problem
which
promised
them
thousands
without
the
usual
humdrum
method
of
working
for
them
we
will
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
leaving
to
your
imagination
the
breaks
and
guilty
starts
and
moments
of
intense
listening
and
anxious
fear
with
which
he
seasoned
it
i
did
as
you
bid
me
he
whispered
yesterday
fresh
orders
came
from
abroad
in
cipher
as
usual
it
an
unreadable
cipher
i
had
experts
on
it
many
times
i
had
hung
it
up
and
though
business
was
heavy
my
business
you
know
i
had
eyes
for
our
fair
friend
and
knew
every
step
she
took
about
the
offices
i
even
knew
when
her
eyes
first
fell
on
the
cablegram
i
had
my
door
open
and
i
caught
her
looking
up
from
her
work
and
what
was
more
caught
the
pause
in
the
of
the
typewriter
as
she
looked
and
read
if
she
had
not
been
able
to
read
the
would
have
gone
on
for
i
believe
she
could
work
that
typewriter
with
her
eyes
shut
but
her
attention
was
caught
and
she
stopped
i
tell
you
i
been
humiliated
for
the
last
time
i
in
for
anything
that
will
make
that
girl
step
down
and
out
what
was
that
muttered
curses
from
his
companion
brought
him
back
to
his
story
with
a
gulp
he
went
on
you
may
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
i
watched
her
after
that
and
sure
enough
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
had
gone
into
the
room
where
the
safe
is
instantly
i
prepared
my
i
waited
just
long
enough
to
hear
her
voice
in
that
one
song
she
sings
then
i
jumped
from
my
seat
and
rushed
to
the
door
shouting
lee
miss
lee
your
father
your
father
making
hullabaloo
enough
to
raise
the
dead
and
scare
her
out
of
her
wits
for
she
dotes
on
that
old
man
and
would
sell
her
soul
for
his
sake
i
do
believe
great
heavens
it
worked
as
i
live
it
worked
i
heard
her
voice
fail
on
that
high
upper
note
of
hers
and
then
the
sound
of
her
feet
staggering
slipping
over
the
floor
and
in
another
moment
the
fumbling
of
her
hand
on
the
knob
and
the
slow
opening
of
the
door
which
she
seemed
to
have
no
power
to
manage
helping
her
i
pulled
it
open
and
there
beyond
her
and
her
white
shocked
face
i
saw
i
saw
chapter
ix
safe
door
is
opened
i
go
on
do
be
a
fool
that
was
nothing
i
do
know
it
was
like
a
great
sigh
at
my
ear
but
this
is
awful
could
we
have
one
spark
of
light
and
have
the
police
upon
us
the
next
minute
look
up
at
that
window
you
can
see
it
ca
you
yes
yes
but
very
faintly
fellows
whispered
but
you
can
see
it
so
could
those
outside
if
we
had
one
glimmer
of
light
in
here
no
no
you
have
to
stand
the
dark
or
quit
but
you
sha
quit
till
you
told
me
what
you
saw
in
the
room
where
the
safe
is
the
safe
door
opening
his
voice
trembled
so
that
the
other
shook
him
to
steady
his
nerves
not
opened
mind
you
but
opening
it
was
like
magic
and
i
stared
so
that
she
forgot
her
fears
and
forgot
her
questions
turning
from
me
with
a
startled
cry
she
looked
behind
her
and
saw
what
i
saw
and
tried
to
push
me
out
come
i
come
she
whispered
me
a
minute
and
i
come
but
i
was
going
to
do
that
safe
door
is
opened
i
cried
you
do
it
she
did
know
what
to
say
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
in
such
a
state
then
she
whispered
in
awful
agitation
i
been
given
the
combination
by
stoughton
i
duly
following
his
orders
but
my
father
what
about
my
father
you
frightened
me
so
i
forgot
that
i
waited
staring
at
her
but
she
did
finish
she
just
asked
father
what
has
happened
to
him
serious
i
managed
to
say
i
wished
the
old
father
was
in
ballyhack
but
served
his
turn
i
must
say
that
he
served
his
turn
telephone
message
i
went
on
had
had
a
nervous
spell
and
wanted
you
i
said
that
you
could
go
home
at
noon
she
stood
looking
at
me
doubtfully
then
her
eyes
stole
back
to
the
safe
will
have
to
leave
me
here
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
have
stoughton
business
to
attend
to
he
will
not
be
pleased
at
my
having
given
away
his
secret
he
did
not
wish
it
known
who
controlled
his
affairs
in
his
absence
but
now
that
you
do
know
you
will
be
doing
the
right
thing
to
let
me
go
on
in
the
way
he
has
planned
for
me
his
orders
must
be
carried
out
she
is
very
determined
and
understands
herself
only
too
well
but
i
am
manager
and
i
paid
her
back
in
her
own
coin
all
very
well
said
i
what
proof
have
i
that
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
you
have
opened
the
safe
you
say
you
have
the
combination
but
people
sometimes
surprise
a
combination
and
open
a
safe
from
other
interests
than
those
of
their
employer
you
seem
a
good
girl
but
are
a
and
there
are
men
here
much
more
likely
to
be
in
confidence
than
yourself
with
that
open
safe
before
us
i
can
not
leave
you
here
alone
what
you
take
from
it
i
must
see
and
if
possible
be
present
at
your
negotiations
that
i
consider
a
manager
duty
under
the
circumstances
fellows
she
asked
you
read
this
telegram
i
felt
bound
to
reply
that
acquits
you
i
can
and
again
she
tried
to
urge
me
to
go
out
but
i
would
not
be
urged
i
was
staring
across
the
room
at
the
open
safe
and
in
fancy
clutching
its
contents
in
fact
i
made
one
step
toward
them
but
she
drew
herself
up
with
such
an
air
that
i
paused
she
a
big
girl
you
know
and
not
to
be
fooled
with
when
she
angry
a
step
farther
and
i
will
scream
for
the
watchman
she
whispered
all
our
talk
had
been
low
for
there
were
listening
ears
everywhere
we
could
risk
that
and
i
stepped
back
immediately
she
saw
her
advantage
and
added
you
do
not
think
better
of
it
and
leave
the
room
i
scream
for
answer
to
this
i
said
that
i
chapter
x
have
a
what
a
yell
answered
him
something
hit
me
something
hit
me
yes
i
hit
you
and
i
hit
you
again
if
you
do
go
on
fellows
shivered
attempted
some
puerile
protest
balked
and
stammeringly
obeyed
his
restless
and
irritated
companion
i
i
said
i
was
such
a
fool
then
as
i
am
now
that
she
had
lied
when
she
told
me
that
she
had
the
combination
there
was
no
combination
the
safe
did
not
even
have
a
lock
the
door
opened
with
a
spring
how
had
she
induced
that
spring
to
give
way
i
demanded
to
know
and
did
she
tell
you
no
she
merely
repeated
will
scream
and
that
will
cause
a
scandal
which
will
lead
to
your
discharge
not
mine
so
so
i
came
out
blast
your
eyes
and
when
did
come
out
within
five
minutes
i
watched
the
clock
and
what
did
she
have
nothing
in
sight
i
see
a
deep
game
but
i
know
a
deeper
there
is
no
possibility
of
breaking
into
that
safe
by
night
undetected
by
the
watchman
none
and
that
watchman
is
incorruptible
the
whole
contents
of
the
safe
would
move
him
to
connect
himself
with
this
job
the
job
must
be
done
by
day
and
during
office
hours
yes
and
can
not
be
done
without
the
assistance
of
this
girl
you
heard
very
well
i
have
a
scheme
now
listen
to
me
not
even
the
rat
which
at
that
minute
nibbled
at
fellows
boot
heel
could
have
heard
what
followed
the
panting
of
two
breasts
was
however
audible
and
when
fifty
minutes
later
both
crawled
out
of
the
cellar
window
among
the
rubbish
which
littered
the
rear
of
this
once
holy
place
the
one
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
the
other
with
fear
they
parted
at
the
first
thoroughfare
neither
having
eyes
to
see
nor
hearts
to
appreciate
the
touching
scene
which
miles
away
was
taking
place
in
a
little
flat
not
very
far
from
harlem
an
old
man
frail
in
body
but
with
a
sturdy
spirit
yet
was
looking
up
from
his
pillow
at
the
loving
face
of
a
young
girl
who
was
bending
over
him
i
can
not
sleep
he
said
to
her
i
can
not
sleep
but
that
must
not
disturb
you
i
have
so
many
things
to
think
pleasant
things
but
you
have
only
cares
and
must
rest
from
them
you
look
very
tired
tired
and
worried
leave
me
and
sleep
i
want
to
see
you

illustration
old
man
was
looking
up
at
the
loving
face
of
a
young
chapter
xi
will
go
the
next
day
there
was
a
dearth
of
assistants
in
the
office
one
was
sick
one
had
pleaded
a
vacation
two
had
business
for
the
concern
which
took
them
into
different
quarters
of
the
city
and
mr
beers
who
was
next
in
authority
to
fellows
had
been
summoned
to
serve
on
the
grand
jury
perhaps
it
was
this
knowledge
that
mr
beers
would
be
absent
which
had
led
to
the
manager
easiness
in
regard
to
the
others
for
he
had
been
easy
or
so
miss
lee
thought
when
she
arrived
in
the
morning
and
saw
the
office
almost
empty
however
it
did
not
trouble
her
much
on
the
contrary
the
quiet
and
of
the
two
clerks
who
did
the
business
of
the
day
seemed
rather
to
elate
her
and
she
went
about
her
work
copying
letters
and
taking
down
notes
with
an
alacrity
and
air
of
cheerful
hope
which
caused
the
manager
to
cast
toward
her
more
than
one
suspicious
look
from
his
desk
in
the
adjoining
room
was
not
busy
though
he
had
been
the
first
to
arrive
that
morning
and
he
had
brought
with
him
a
large
square
package
which
he
had
taken
into
the
room
which
held
the
safe
he
pretended
to
be
busy
but
any
one
watching
him
closely
would
have
noticed
that
his
eyes
and
not
his
hands
were
all
that
were
engaged
and
they
were
anywhere
but
on
his
desk
or
the
letter
he
appeared
to
be
reading
an
observer
would
also
have
noticed
that
his
nervousness
was
of
the
extreme
sort
and
that
the
trembling
which
shook
his
whole
body
increased
visibly
whenever
his
glance
fell
on
the
door
of
mr
beers
private
room
opening
at
his
back
no
one
was
supposed
to
be
in
that
room
and
had
miss
lee
not
been
one
minute
late
this
especial
morning
perhaps
there
might
not
have
been
but
in
that
one
minute
grace
a
man
had
entered
the
office
who
had
not
gone
out
again
and
where
could
he
be
if
not
in
that
one
closed
room
the
room
which
held
the
safe
was
open
as
usual
and
many
of
fellows
glances
traveled
that
way
he
had
entered
it
once
only
since
his
first
hurried
visit
of
the
early
morning
but
only
to
pull
down
the
shade
over
the
glass
in
the
door
communicating
with
the
outside
hall
this
was
his
usual
custom
and
it
attracted
no
attention
why
he
enter
it
again
he
thought
he
would
a
fascination
was
upon
him
the
problem
he
had
given
beau
johnson
to
solve
was
to
receive
a
test
this
day
which
would
make
him
a
rich
man
or
a
felon
but
before
that
hour
why
not
make
his
own
study
his
own
investigation
true
he
had
made
these
many
times
before
but
not
with
such
lights
to
guide
him
he
might
learn
but
no
the
very
conceit
was
folly
he
knew
his
own
limitations
else
he
had
not
called
in
the
services
of
this
crook
he
could
learn
nothing
by
himself
but
he
might
look
the
place
over
and
see
if
all
was
in
shape
for
the
great
attempt
that
was
only
his
duty
beau
johnson
had
a
right
to
expect
that
of
him
if
the
scrub
woman
had
moved
anything
at
the
thought
that
this
possibly
might
have
happened
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
hurried
into
the
outer
office
but
when
he
turned
toward
the
room
of
the
safe
he
met
miss
lee
eye
fixed
upon
him
with
such
a
keen
inquiring
look
that
he
faltered
in
his
determination
and
went
in
another
direction
instead
knew
that
he
had
no
business
in
that
room
and
she
also
knew
that
he
knew
she
knew
this
any
pretense
that
he
had
would
only
rouse
her
suspicions
and
these
must
be
lulled
to
the
point
of
security
or
she
might
not
enter
there
herself
and
on
her
entering
there
everything
depended
almost
immediately
upon
the
thought
he
was
back
in
his
seat
and
the
weary
moments
crept
on
would
she
never
make
her
accustomed
visit
to
that
room
no
cablegram
had
come
that
morning
but
she
would
find
some
reason
for
going
in
of
that
he
had
been
assured
by
johnson
why
he
had
not
been
told
she
will
go
in
beau
johnson
had
said
and
fellows
believed
him
he
believed
everything
the
other
said
otherwise
he
could
not
have
gone
on
with
this
business
but
she
was
very
long
about
it
harlowe
would
be
coming
back
chapter
xii
block
of
ah
he
had
an
idea
it
was
not
his
own
but
for
the
moment
he
thought
it
was
he
would
leave
the
office
himself
and
thus
give
her
an
opportunity
to
quit
her
work
and
shut
herself
up
with
the
safe
but
was
his
mind
leaving
him
there
was
something
to
be
done
first
the
way
must
be
cleared
for
the
man
in
hiding
to
enter
that
room
before
she
did
how
was
this
to
be
accomplished
a
dozen
suggestions
had
been
given
him
by
his
confederate
but
he
had
forgotten
them
all
he
was
in
too
great
a
whirl
to
think
yet
he
must
think
some
way
must
be
found
ah
he
had
it
taking
up
the
receiver
at
his
side
he
telephoned
to
a
german
friend
to
call
him
up
in
five
minutes
giving
him
the
number
of
the
telephone
in
the
farthest
room
this
he
did
in
german
telling
him
it
was
a
joke
and
that
he
was
not
to
insist
upon
an
answer
then
he
waited
in
five
minutes
this
farther
bell
rang
calling
to
miss
lee
he
asked
her
to
answer
for
him
saying
he
was
very
busy
as
she
rose
he
gave
a
preconcerted
signal
on
the
door
of
mr
beers
room
as
she
disappeared
in
the
one
beyond
the
dapper
figure
of
johnson
crossed
the
outer
office
and
slipped
into
the
one
holding
the
safe
a
minute
later
she
was
back
reporting
the
message
and
getting
instructions
but
the
one
thing
she
had
to
fear
had
been
done
the
trap
had
been
laid
and
now
for
its
victim
it
was
not
long
before
that
victim
responded
to
the
call
on
the
departure
of
the
manager
from
the
room
grace
lee
rose
and
with
a
conscious
look
toward
the
two
clerks
slipped
across
the
floor
to
the
open
door
of
the
safe
room
entering
she
swung
to
the
door
which
closed
with
a
snap
then
with
just
a
moment
of
hesitation
in
which
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
regain
her
breath
she
passed
quickly
across
to
the
safe
and
took
up
her
stand
before
it
so
directly
and
so
quickly
had
she
done
this
that
she
had
not
seen
the
slim
immovable
figure
drawn
up
against
the
wall
at
her
right
behind
the
projection
of
a
large
bookcase
nor
did
any
influence
for
good
or
evil
cause
her
to
turn
after
she
had
reached
the
safe
all
her
thoughts
all
her
hopes
all
the
dreams
which
she
had
cherished
seemed
to
be
concentrated
in
the
blank
eyeless
object
which
confronted
her
impenetrable
to
all
appearance
a
block
of
steel
without
visible
opening
an
enigma
among
safes
the
problem
of
all
problems
to
every
cracksman
in
town
but
one
which
was
about
to
be
solved
if
one
could
judge
from
the
thrill
which
now
shook
her
and
in
shaking
her
communicated
the
same
excitement
to
the
silent
breathless
determined
man
in
her
rear
watching
her
as
the
tiger
watches
the
quarry
and
with
the
same
tiger
spring
latent
in
his
eye
in
a
moment
her
secret
would
be
out
and
then
chapter
xiii
am
from
for
just
a
minute
grace
lee
paused
before
the
blank
door
of
the
safe
then
she
passed
around
to
an
unused
speaking
tube
in
the
neighboring
wall
halting
before
it
in
low
but
distinct
tones
she
began
to
sing
the
famous
aria
from
the
magic
flute
all
agog
with
eyes
starting
and
ears
alert
the
man
behind
listened
and
watched
nothing
happened
then
came
a
change
gradually
her
voice
rose
sweet
and
piercing
till
it
reached
that
famous
f
in
alt
so
rarely
attempted
so
exciting
to
the
ear
when
fairly
taken
and
fairly
held
grace
lee
could
take
it
and
as
it
hung
sweet
and
deliciously
thrilling
in
the
air
beau
johnson
saw
to
his
amazement
though
he
was
in
a
way
prepared
for
it
the
heavy
safe
door
slip
softly
ajar
she
had
done
it
with
her
voice
how
he
could
only
vaguely
guess
he
was
better
educated
than
most
of
his
class
or
he
could
not
have
understood
it
at
all
as
it
was
he
laid
it
to
the
vibration
caused
by
a
certain
definite
note
acting
on
some
delicate
mechanism
set
in
accord
with
that
note
which
mechanism
starting
another
and
a
stronger
one
gradually
led
up
to
that
which
drew
the
bolts
and
set
the
door
ajar
whether
his
theory
were
true
or
not
mattered
little
at
the
moment
the
event
for
which
he
waited
had
been
accomplished
and
accomplished
before
his
eyes
to
profit
by
it
was
his
next
thought
and
to
this
end
he
held
himself
ready
for
the
spring
which
had
laid
latent
in
his
eyes
since
he
first
saw
her
advance
toward
the
safe
she
was
ignorant
of
his
presence
this
was
evident
from
the
jaunty
way
she
turned
from
the
tube
still
singing
but
in
a
desultory
way
which
showed
that
her
thoughts
were
no
longer
on
her
music
but
she
was
not
so
engrossed
that
she
did
not
see
him
the
moment
that
her
face
turned
his
way
her
eyes
enlarged
her
body
stiffened
her
whole
personality
took
on
power
and
purpose
and
sprang
more
quickly
than
he
did
and
shut
the
safe
door
with
one
quick
movement
of
her
hand
that
fastened
it
as
securely
as
before
then
she
drew
herself
up
to
meet
his
rush
a
noble
figure
of
resolute
womanhood
which
any
other
man
would
have
hesitated
to
assail
but
he
was
proof
to
any
appeal
of
this
kind
she
had
been
quicker
than
he
who
was
esteemed
the
readiest
in
his
class
and
he
owed
her
a
grudge
if
only
for
that
smiling
it
was
a
way
of
his
when
deeply
moved
or
deeply
dangerous
he
accosted
her
with
smooth
and
treacherous
words
do
scream
young
lady
screaming
will
do
you
no
good
fellows
has
left
the
business
to
me
and
i
am
quite
competent
to
manage
it
i
am
from
headquarters
a
detective
yesterday
you
aroused
the
suspicions
and
i
was
detailed
this
morning
to
watch
you
what
do
you
want
from
stoughton
safe
an
honest
answer
may
help
you
nothing
else
will
illustration
was
ignorant
of
his
i
want
she
hesitated
eyeing
him
over
with
an
insight
and
an
undoubted
air
of
which
told
the
hardy
rascal
that
in
this
woman
he
was
likely
to
meet
his
match
i
want
some
securities
of
stoughton
which
he
has
ordered
me
to
dispose
of
for
him
i
am
in
his
confidence
as
i
can
prove
to
you
if
you
will
give
me
the
opportunity
i
have
papers
at
home
that
will
satisfy
any
one
of
my
right
to
open
this
safe
and
to
negotiate
such
papers
as
are
designated
in
cablegrams
i
do
doubt
it
the
words
came
easily
from
the
mobile
lips
of
the
wily
beau
johnson
but
it
was
not
to
do
stoughton
business
that
you
opened
the
safe
just
now
you
have
had
no
orders
you
had
no
order
yesterday
another
purpose
is
in
your
mind
a
personal
purpose
it
is
this
abuse
of
stoughton
confidence
which
brings
me
here
want
three
thousand
dollars
badly
chapter
xiv
do
not
she
recoiled
strong
as
she
was
she
was
not
proof
against
this
surprise
how
do
you
know
that
she
asked
her
voice
losing
its
clear
tone
i
do
not
deny
it
but
how
could
you
know
what
i
thought
to
be
a
secret
between
you
and
your
lover
well
we
the
police
know
many
things
young
lady
we
have
a
gift
we
also
have
a
kind
of
foreknowledge
i
could
tell
you
something
of
your
future
if
you
will
deign
to
listen
to
me
your
lover
is
an
honest
man
what
do
you
suppose
he
will
do
when
he
hears
that
you
have
been
arrested
for
attempted
burglary
on
your
employer
effects
he
had
been
slowly
advancing
as
he
reeled
off
these
glib
sentences
but
he
paused
as
he
met
her
smile
it
was
not
of
the
same
sort
as
his
but
it
was
not
without
a
certain
suggestiveness
which
he
felt
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
understand
before
he
threw
off
his
mask
i
do
know
what
he
will
do
said
she
meeting
the
false
eye
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
safe
but
i
know
what
i
shall
do
if
you
carry
out
the
purpose
you
threaten
show
my
papers
to
the
police
and
demand
evidence
of
my
having
any
bad
intentions
in
opening
this
safe
this
morning
i
think
you
will
have
difficulty
in
producing
any
i
think
that
you
will
only
prove
yourself
a
fool
are
you
so
strong
with
the
authorities
as
to
brave
that
astonished
at
her
insight
and
more
than
astonished
at
her
the
experienced
cracksman
paused
and
then
in
tones
he
rarely
used
remarked
quietly
you
are
playing
with
your
life
miss
lee
i
have
a
pistol
leveled
at
you
from
my
pocket
and
i
the
man
to
fire
if
you
give
me
the
slightest
occasion
to
do
so
i
beau
johnson
miss
a
detective
if
you
please
but
also
a
tolerably
experienced
cracksman
and
i
want
a
taste
of
those
bonds
and
mr
fellows
the
words
rang
out
clear
and
fearlessly
oh
he
he
a
muff
you
need
concern
yourself
about
him
the
matter
between
us
two
three
thousand
dollars
for
you
and
a
little
more
perhaps
for
me
and
i
to
take
all
the
blame
her
eye
stole
toward
the
door
no
one
could
enter
that
way
she
knew
even
her
screams
if
she
survived
them
might
alarm
but
could
not
bring
her
help
for
several
minutes
if
not
longer
yet
she
did
not
tremble
only
grew
a
shade
paler
you
do
not
answer
what
have
you
to
say
this
she
was
like
marble
now
you
will
not
kill
me
because
that
would
be
virtually
to
kill
yourself
you
can
not
leave
this
room
without
my
help
nor
fire
a
shot
without
being
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
i
want
three
thousand
dollars
and
i
mean
to
have
them
but
i
do
not
see
how
you
are
going
to
get
the
few
more
which
you
promise
yourself
certainly
i
am
not
going
to
aid
you
in
doing
so
and
you
can
not
open
that
safe
you
have
not
the
musical
training
no
the
word
came
like
a
shot
possibly
in
lieu
of
a
shot
for
if
ever
he
felt
murderous
it
was
at
that
moment
i
have
not
a
musical
training
but
that
does
not
make
me
helpless
in
a
few
moments
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
test
your
voice
again
there
the
office
clock
ticking
count
the
strokes
she
stood
fascinated
what
did
he
mean
by
this
involuntarily
she
did
his
bidding
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
yes
he
repeated
eleven
and
at
half
past
your
old
father
dies
dies
her
lips
did
not
frame
the
words
her
eyes
looked
it
her
whole
sinking
suddenly
collapsing
figure
gave
voice
to
the
maddening
query
chapter
xv
if
fellows
will
stay
yes
such
is
the
understanding
if
i
do
not
telephone
my
pals
to
hold
off
he
not
at
home
he
with
my
friends
they
do
care
very
much
about
old
men
and
if
i
have
not
a
decent
show
of
money
by
eleven
this
morning
the
orders
are
to
knock
him
on
the
head
it
take
a
very
hard
knock
he
was
far
from
being
in
prime
condition
this
morning
she
had
shown
great
feeling
at
the
beginning
of
this
address
but
at
its
close
she
drew
herself
up
again
and
met
him
with
something
of
her
old
composure
these
are
all
lies
said
she
my
father
would
never
leave
his
house
at
the
instigation
of
any
gang
in
the
first
place
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
attempt
the
stairs
you
can
not
deceive
me
in
this
fashion
he
might
be
carried
down
he
would
submit
to
that
nor
would
the
other
lodgers
in
the
house
allow
it
without
an
express
order
from
me
they
got
the
order
not
from
you
but
from
him
he
demanded
to
be
allowed
to
go
you
see
fellows
sent
a
message
that
you
were
hurt
i
will
speak
the
whole
truth
and
say
dying
the
old
man
could
not
be
held
after
that
he
went
with
the
messenger
her
cheeks
were
now
like
ashes
she
had
gauged
the
man
before
her
and
felt
that
he
was
fully
capable
of
this
villainy
how
great
a
villainy
she
alone
knew
who
had
the
history
of
this
old
man
in
her
heart
he
went
with
the
messenger
repeated
johnson
watching
her
face
with
a
cruel
leer
that
messenger
knew
where
to
take
him
you
may
be
sure
it
was
to
a
place
quite
unknown
to
the
police
and
to
every
one
else
but
myself
five
minutes
more
gone
miss
in
just
minutes
more
you
will
be
an
orphan
and
one
impediment
to
your
marriage
will
be
at
an
end
how
about
the
other
oh
she
wailed
if
i
could
really
believe
you
i
can
smooth
away
that
doubt
if
you
will
promise
not
to
compromise
me
with
the
clerks
or
any
one
inside
there
i
will
allow
you
to
telephone
home
and
learn
the
truth
of
what
i
have
told
you
anything
further
will
end
all
business
between
us
and
wind
up
your
father
affairs
at
the
hour
set
i
can
afford
to
humor
you
for
ten
minutes
more
in
this
nonsense
i
will
do
it
she
cried
i
must
know
what
i
am
fighting
before
she
caught
herself
back
but
he
was
quite
able
to
finish
the
sentence
for
her
before
you
submit
to
the
inevitable
he
smiled
her
head
fell
and
he
pointed
toward
the
door
i
will
trust
you
to
guard
my
our
interests
said
he
open
and
go
directly
to
your
own
telephone
with
a
staggering
step
she
obeyed
creeping
up
stealthily
behind
her
he
watched
her
manner
of
opening
the
door
and
profited
by
the
one
quick
glance
he
got
of
the
office
as
she
stepped
through
and
passed
hurriedly
forward
to
her
desk
there
was
no
one
within
sight
fellows
had
not
yet
returned
and
the
clerks
were
too
remote
to
notice
her
agitation
or
pay
attention
to
her
gait
or
the
tremulousness
of
her
tone
as
she
called
for
her
home
number
could
be
better
thought
he
now
if
fellows
will
stay
away
long
enough
i
be
able
to
double
the
boodle
i
promised
myself
this
with
a
chuckle
meantime
miss
lee
had
got
in
her
message
the
answer
sent
her
flying
toward
him
he
gone
he
gone
she
gasped
my
old
old
father
oh
you
wretch
save
him
and
you
save
me
first
he
whispered
and
was
about
to
draw
her
back
into
the
room
with
the
safe
when
the
outer
door
opened
and
a
stranger
entered
on
business
her
agony
at
the
interruption
and
the
few
necessary
words
it
involved
caused
the
visitor
to
stare
but
she
was
able
to
make
herself
intelligible
and
to
turn
him
over
to
one
of
the
clerks
after
which
she
rejoined
johnson
closing
the
door
quietly
behind
her
his
greeting
was
characteristic
you
waste
breath
said
he
by
all
this
emotion
you
need
it
to
open
the
safe
what
guarantee
have
i
that
you
will
keep
your
part
of
the
contract
she
cried
i
sing
the
door
opens
you
help
yourself
and
you
go
that
does
not
restore
to
me
my
father
oh
i
play
fair
in
proof
of
it
here
my
pistol
if
on
our
going
out
i
do
not
stop
with
you
at
the
telephone
and
let
you
communicate
with
your
father
and
send
my
own
message
of
release
then
shoot
me
in
the
back
i
give
you
leave
taking
the
pistol
he
held
out
she
cocked
it
and
looking
into
the
chambers
found
they
were
all
full
i
know
how
to
use
it
she
said
simply
admiration
showed
in
his
face
he
bowed
and
pointed
toward
the
tube
now
for
the
song
he
cried
chapter
xvi
was
not
paper
i
meant
to
with
a
bound
she
took
her
stand
she
was
white
as
death
and
greatly
excited
watching
her
curiously
the
crafty
villain
noted
the
quick
throbbing
of
her
throat
and
the
feverish
grip
on
the
pistol
time
is
galloping
he
remarked
she
gave
a
gasp
opened
her
lips
and
essayed
to
sing
an
awful
indescribable
murmur
was
all
that
could
be
heard
stiffening
herself
she
resolutely
calmed
down
her
agitation
and
tried
again
the
result
was
but
little
better
than
before
turning
with
a
cry
she
looked
with
eyes
into
the
unmoved
slightly
sardonic
face
of
the
man
behind
her
i
can
not
sing
you
have
frightened
away
my
voice
i
can
not
raise
that
note
even
to
save
my
father
life
i
choking
choking
then
as
she
caught
the
devilish
gleam
lighting
up
his
eye
she
added
you
will
never
have
those
thousands
the
safe
is
closed
to
us
both
he
laughed
a
very
low
cautious
laugh
but
it
made
her
eyes
distend
with
uncertainty
and
dread
you
fail
to
do
justice
to
my
said
he
i
took
this
into
my
calculations
i
know
women
they
can
be
wicked
enough
but
they
lack
coolness
let
me
see
now
what
i
can
do
i
can
not
sing
but
i
have
a
little
de
which
can
walking
away
from
her
he
approached
a
small
table
on
which
stood
an
object
she
had
never
seen
in
that
room
before
it
was
covered
with
a
cloth
and
as
he
removed
this
cloth
she
reeled
with
surprise
then
she
became
still
with
hope
and
the
rush
of
fresh
and
overpowering
emotions
a
graphophone
stood
revealed
one
of
the
finest
quality
it
was
set
to
play
the
air
so
often
on
her
lips
and
in
another
moment
that
keen
high
note
rang
through
the
room
that
and
no
more
it
answered
slowly
softly
after
one
breathless
moment
the
door
they
both
watched
with
fascinated
gaze
swung
slowly
ajar
just
as
they
had
seen
it
do
at
the
beginning
of
this
interview
and
johnson
coming
forward
pulled
it
open
with
a
jerk
and
began
to
fumble
among
the
contents
of
the
safe
she
could
have
killed
him
easily
he
had
forgotten
but
so
had
she
and
there
was
no
one
else
by
to
remind
her
had
there
been
he
would
have
seen
a
strange
spectacle
for
no
sooner
had
johnson
hand
struck
those
shelves
and
minute
drawers
than
grace
lee
whole
attitude
and
expression
changed
from
a
terrified
incapable
woman
she
became
again
her
old
self
strong
watchful
creeping
up
behind
him
she
looked
over
his
shoulders
as
he
examined
with
his
quick
experienced
eye
the
various
papers
he
drew
out
noting
his
anger
and
growing
disappointment
as
he
found
them
unavailable
for
immediate
use
conscious
of
her
presence
his
rage
grew
till
it
shot
forth
in
words
not
stinting
oaths
he
whirled
on
her
after
a
moment
and
asked
where
the
securities
were
meant
to
have
them
you
know
where
the
ready
money
is
show
me
show
me
at
once
or
then
a
great
anguish
passed
across
her
face
a
look
of
farewell
to
hopes
sweet
and
dearly
cherished
if
he
saw
it
he
did
not
heed
all
his
evil
indomitable
will
shone
in
the
eye
he
turned
up
askance
at
her
and
though
she
held
the
means
of
killing
him
in
her
hand
she
bowed
to
that
will
and
leaning
over
him
she
whispered
in
his
ear
it
was
not
paper
i
meant
to
have
but
but
something
else
i
she
stopped
for
breath
was
leaving
her
his
slim
assured
hand
was
straying
toward
a
certain
knob
hidden
partly
from
sight
but
plain
to
the
touch
if
his
fingers
crept
that
way
listen
she
was
gasping
now
but
her
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
emphasized
her
words
there
are
jewels
at
the
other
end
stoughton
bridal
jewels
they
are
worth
thousands
i
i
meant
to
take
those
they
are
in
a
compartment
under
that
lower
drawer
yes
yes
there
they
are
take
them
and
be
gone
i
i
have
lost
but
you
will
give
me
back
my
father
see
there
are
not
many
minutes
left
oh
be
merciful
and
chapter
xvii
for
my
part
of
the
he
was
looking
at
the
jewels
appraising
them
making
sure
they
were
real
and
marketable
she
was
looking
at
them
too
with
a
wild
longing
and
a
bitter
disappointment
which
he
turning
at
that
moment
to
mark
her
looks
saw
and
rated
at
its
full
value
well
i
guess
they
do
he
exclaimed
pausing
in
his
task
of
thrusting
the
gems
in
his
pocket
to
hand
her
a
bracelet
ornamented
with
one
small
diamond
but
i
expected
more
from
all
this
fuss
and
feathers
was
it
to
guard
these
yes
she
murmured
thrusting
the
bracelet
into
the
neck
of
her
dress
and
stepping
quickly
back
they
are
priceless
to
the
owner
associations
you
know
stoughton
is
dead
there
that
will
do
now
for
my
part
of
the
bargain
and
bethinking
her
at
last
of
the
pistol
she
raised
it
and
pointed
it
full
in
his
face
you
will
close
that
door
now
and
send
the
telephone
you
promised
he
rose
and
banged
to
the
door
all
right
he
cried
you
behaved
well
now
hide
that
pistol
in
your
waist
and
we
step
into
the
outer
office
she
did
as
she
was
bid
and
in
a
moment
more
they
were
crossing
the
floor
outside
as
they
did
so
she
noticed
that
the
two
clerks
had
been
sent
out
to
luncheon
leaving
them
alone
with
fellows
this
was
not
encouraging
nor
did
she
like
the
click
which
at
this
moment
beau
johnson
made
with
his
tongue
it
sounded
like
a
preconcerted
signal
whether
so
or
not
it
brought
fellows
from
his
room
and
in
another
instant
he
was
standing
with
them
before
the
telephone
there
was
a
clock
over
the
door
it
stood
at
just
minutes
after
eleven
hurry
she
whispered
as
the
other
took
up
the
receiver
she
did
not
need
to
say
it
his
own
anxiety
seemed
to
be
as
great
as
hers
but
his
anxiety
was
to
be
gone
the
nerve
which
sustained
him
while
the
issue
was
doubtful
gave
some
slight
tokens
of
failing
now
that
his
efforts
had
brought
success
and
only
this
small
obligation
lay
between
him
and
the
enjoyment
of
the
booty
he
had
won
at
such
a
risk
she
was
sure
that
his
voice
trembled
as
he
uttered
the
familiar
hello
and
during
the
interchange
of
words
which
followed
the
strain
was
perhaps
as
great
on
him
as
on
her
hello
how
the
old
man
she
could
hear
the
answer
it
swept
her
fears
away
in
a
moment
well
but
anxious
about
the
girl
she
all
right
everything
all
right
take
the
sick
man
home
and
tell
him
that
his
daughter
will
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
he
is
i
must
hear
my
father
voice
it
was
grace
who
was
speaking
i
will
give
a
cry
that
will
echo
through
this
building
if
you
do
not
put
me
in
communication
with
him
at
once
her
hand
went
out
to
the
receiver
the
veins
on
beau
johnson
forehead
stood
out
threateningly
curse
you
he
muttered
but
he
gave
the
order
just
the
same
hello
do
shut
off
the
girl
nervous
wants
to
hear
her
voice
have
him
up
two
words
from
him
will
answer
father
grace
mouth
was
at
the
phone
no
reply
she
cast
one
look
at
johnson
they
getting
him
on
his
feet
he
grumbled
eye
was
on
the
door
father
she
called
again
her
voice
tremulous
with
doubt
and
anxiety
a
murmur
this
time
but
she
recognized
it
it
he
it
he
she
cried
he
safe
he
well
but
johnson
had
no
time
for
catching
the
receiver
back
he
took
his
place
again
at
the
phone
and
shouted
a
few
final
injunctions
then
he
faced
her
with
the
question
are
you
satisfied
she
nodded
speechless
at
last
and
almost
breathless
from
exhaustion
he
bowed
and
made
for
the
door
as
he
opened
it
fellows
slid
forward
and
joined
him
both
were
leaving
he
as
well
as
johnson
she
caught
the
look
which
the
manager
threw
her
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
there
was
threat
in
that
look
and
her
heart
strings
tightened
as
she
stood
alone
there
facing
her
fearful
duty
fellows
was
a
thief
the
manager
of
this
concern
was
even
then
perhaps
walking
off
with
the
booty
wrenched
from
her
care
by
the
devil
own
inquisition
what
should
she
do
send
for
philip
yes
that
was
all
her
tortured
mind
could
grasp
she
would
send
for
her
own
philip
and
get
his
advice
before
she
notified
the
police
or
sent
the
inevitable
cablegram
she
was
too
ill
too
shaken
to
do
more
philip
philip
she
was
fainting
she
felt
it
and
was
raising
her
voice
to
call
in
one
of
the
clerks
when
the
outer
door
opened
and
fellows
came
in
she
had
not
expected
him
back
she
had
fondly
believed
that
he
had
gone
with
his
professional
comrade
and
the
sight
of
him
caused
her
to
rise
again
to
her
feet
you
she
murmured
facing
him
in
dull
wonder
at
his
renewed
look
of
threat
i
can
not
stay
in
the
same
room
with
you
you
are
chapter
xviii
have
you
done
among
never
mind
me
came
clearly
and
coldly
from
his
lips
it
is
of
yourself
you
must
think
here
officer
he
cried
opening
the
door
again
and
ushering
in
a
man
in
plain
clothes
but
evidently
one
of
the
force
this
is
the
young
lady
i
accuse
her
of
taking
advantage
of
her
power
to
open
stoughton
private
safe
to
steal
his
jewels
her
confederate
has
escaped
he
had
a
pistol
and
i
had
no
means
of
stopping
him
but
she
is
right
here
and
you
will
make
no
mistake
in
arresting
her
the
booty
is
on
her
and
smart
as
she
is
she
can
not
deny
that
proof
with
a
cry
grace
hand
went
up
to
her
throat
then
she
settled
into
her
usual
self
once
more
the
officer
eyeing
her
asked
what
she
had
to
say
for
herself
a
great
deal
was
her
low
answer
but
i
shall
not
say
it
here
if
fellows
will
go
with
me
to
wherever
you
take
people
suspected
of
what
you
suspect
me
i
can
soon
make
plain
my
position
but
first
i
should
like
to
send
for
my
friend
philip
andrews
he
is
with
the
stickney
company
and
he
is
acquainted
with
my
affairs
and
the
understanding
between
stoughton
and
myself
by
which
i
have
access
to
that
gentleman
safe
and
do
much
of
his
private
business
for
him
that
all
right
send
for
andrews
if
you
wish
but
you
expect
to
talk
to
him
without
witnesses
is
that
your
coat
and
hat
yes
well
put
them
on
fellows
advanced
and
whispered
something
in
the
officer
ear
immediately
the
suspicious
look
grew
in
his
eyes
and
he
watched
her
every
movement
with
increased
care
she
saw
this
and
stepped
up
to
him
i
shall
not
deny
having
this
piece
of
jewelry
about
my
person
she
said
drawing
the
bracelet
from
its
hiding
place
the
man
whom
fellows
calls
my
confederate
gave
it
to
me
and
i
took
it
but
it
will
be
hard
for
him
or
any
one
else
to
prove
that
it
is
a
theft
harder
than
it
will
be
for
me
to
prove
who
is
the
real
culprit
here
and
the
man
whom
you
ought
to
arrest
watch
me
but
watch
him
also
he
is
more
deserving
of
your
close
attention
than
i
am
her
disdain
her
poise
the
beauty
which
came
out
on
her
face
when
she
was
greatly
stirred
gave
her
a
striking
appearance
at
that
moment
the
officer
stared
then
followed
her
glance
toward
fellows
what
he
saw
in
him
made
him
thoughtful
turning
back
to
miss
lee
he
said
kindly
enough
will
you
let
me
have
that
bracelet
she
passed
it
over
and
he
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
now
said
he
i
will
go
first
in
a
few
minutes
follow
me
and
go
down
nassau
street
a
carriage
will
be
at
the
curb
take
it
as
for
fellows
i
can
not
leave
till
some
of
the
clerks
come
in
we
will
all
wait
till
a
clerk
comes
fellows
paled
here
is
one
now
the
door
opened
and
philip
andrews
came
in
illustration
door
opened
and
philip
andrews
came
oh
philip
what
is
this
what
have
you
done
among
you
it
was
no
wonder
he
asked
at
sight
of
him
grace
lee
had
fainted
chapter
xix
that
was
your
two
hours
later
grace
was
explaining
herself
she
was
still
pale
but
very
calm
now
though
a
little
sad
the
sadness
was
not
occasioned
by
any
doubt
she
felt
about
her
father
she
had
telephoned
home
and
learned
that
he
had
arrived
there
and
was
well
and
had
nothing
but
good
to
say
of
his
captors
no
there
was
another
cause
for
her
manifest
depression
a
cause
not
disconnected
with
philip
toward
whom
her
eyes
ever
and
anon
stole
with
an
uneasy
appeal
which
her
mother
would
have
been
troubled
to
see
but
it
comforted
fellows
who
began
to
regard
her
threats
as
idle
in
face
of
the
evidence
of
her
complicity
as
afforded
by
the
concealed
bracelet
the
officer
on
duty
was
questioning
her
had
she
done
this
and
that
yes
she
had
why
then
she
told
her
story
the
story
you
have
already
read
as
she
proceeded
with
it
every
eye
sparkled
under
the
graphic
tale
and
the
police
who
had
some
acquaintance
with
beau
johnson
recognized
his
hand
in
all
that
she
told
one
face
only
wore
a
sneer
and
that
was
fellows
but
no
sneer
could
discredit
a
story
told
with
such
vim
and
straightforward
earnestness
as
she
mentioned
the
emptying
of
the
office
each
person
present
turned
and
gave
him
a
look
the
manager
had
undertaken
a
piece
of
work
too
big
for
him
his
explanations
of
the
presence
of
the
graphophone
in
this
inner
office
were
feeble
and
contradictory
but
he
had
his
revenge
or
thought
he
had
when
she
came
to
the
jewels
she
had
pointed
them
out
but
only
to
save
a
worse
disaster
injury
to
her
father
yes
and
she
paused
and
her
voice
thrilled
in
one
of
the
secret
drawers
she
continued
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
currency
in
large
denominations
the
loss
of
which
would
cripple
the
business
if
not
bankrupt
stoughton
his
hand
was
feeling
its
way
along
the
face
of
this
drawer
in
another
moment
he
would
have
discovered
the
tiny
knob
by
the
manipulation
of
which
this
drawer
opens
to
save
the
struggle
which
would
have
ensued
i
directed
his
attention
elsewhere
i
do
believe
i
did
wrong
but
you
accepted
one
of
these
articles
as
your
share
do
you
believe
you
did
right
in
this
yes
i
will
not
mention
the
smallness
of
the
share
for
that
makes
the
portion
saved
for
the
owner
of
little
account
yet
that
portion
is
saved
i
wish
it
had
been
a
larger
one
no
doubt
so
that
was
your
motive
to
save
this
souvenir
for
mr
stoughton
casting
a
proud
look
at
philip
she
moved
a
step
nearer
to
the
table
on
which
the
bracelet
lay
will
you
be
good
enough
she
asked
her
interrogator
to
take
up
that
bracelet
and
read
the
initials
on
the
inner
side
read
the
official

any
one
here

not
for
all

me
to
place
this
keepsake
and
some
other
valuables
of
mine
in
his
private
safe

the
whole
of
those
jewels

sole
and

great
surprise
i
had
planned
for
my
future

are
worth
some
five
thousand

my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
man
they
would
have
given
us
a
home
if
i
could
have
kept
them
they
would
also
have
given
my
husband
a
start
in

this
i
should
have
preferred
but
i
could
not
let
stoughton

be
endangered

so
they
had
to
go
philip
can
not
you
forgive
me
when
you
think
that
it
was
through
my
folly
the
secret
of
the
safe
became
known

forgive
you

could
not
show
his
feelings

his
eyes
were
eloquent
