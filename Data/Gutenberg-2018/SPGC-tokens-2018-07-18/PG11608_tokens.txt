the
love
affairs
of
an
old
maid
are
not
her
own
but
other
people
and
in
this
volume
we
have
the
love
trials
and
joys
of
a
variety
of
persons
described
and
analyzed
the
peculiarity
of
this
book
is
that
each
type
is
perfectly
distinct
clear
and
interesting
altogether
the
book
is
by
far
the
best
of
those
recently
written
on
the
tender
the
under
side
of
things
a
novel
cloth
ornamental
uncut

and

a
tenderly
beautiful
story
this
book
is
miss
bell
best
effort
and
most
in
the
line
of
what
we
hope
to
see
her
proceed
in
dainty
and
keen
and
bright
and
always
full
of
the
fine
warmth
and
tenderness
of
splendid
chicago
dedicated
with
many
apprehensions
to
the
dull
reader
who
will
insist
upon
taking
this
book
literally
contents
the
untrained
man
under
the
philosophy
of
clothes
woman
rights
in
love
men
as
lovers
as
a
fine
art
girls
and
other
girls
on
the
subject
of
husbands
a
few
men
who
bore
us
the
man
the
dyspeptic
the
man
the
irresistible
man
the
stupid
man
the
new
woman
the
untrained
man
under
since
we
deserved
the
name
of
friends
and
thine
effect
so
lives
in
me
a
part
of
mine
may
live
in
thee
and
move
thee
on
to
noble
ends
every
woman
has
had
at
some
time
in
her
life
an
experience
with
man
in
the
raw
in
reality
one
can
not
set
down
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
age
when
his
rawness
attacks
him
or
the
time
when
he
has
got
the
last
remnant
of
it
out
of
his
system
but
a
close
study
of
the
complaint
and
the
necessity
for
everything
and
everybody
lead
one
to
declare
that
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
age
of
man
emerges
from
his
rawness
and
becomes
a
part
of
trained
humanity
a
humanity
composed
of
men
and
women
trained
in
the
art
of
living
together
i
am
impressed
with
professor
horton
remarks
on
this
subject
it
has
sometimes
struck
me
as
very
singular
he
says
that
while
nothing
is
so
common
and
nothing
is
so
difficult
as
living
with
other
people
we
are
seldom
instructed
in
our
youth
how
to
do
it
well
our
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
acquired
by
experience
chiefly
by
failures
and
by
the
time
that
we
have
tolerably
mastered
the
delicate
art
we
are
on
the
point
of
being
called
to
the
isolation
of
the
grave
or
shall
i
say
to
the
vast
company
of
the
majority
but
an
art
of
so
much
practical
moment
deserves
a
little
more
consideration
it
should
not
be
taught
by
chance
or
in
fragments
but
duly
deployed
expounded
and
enforced
it
is
of
far
more
pressing
importance
for
example
than
the
art
of
playing
the
piano
or
the
violin
and
is
quite
as
difficult
to
learn
it
is
written
is
not
good
that
man
should
be
alone
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
often
far
from
good
to
be
with
him
a
docile
cat
is
preferable
a
mongoose
or
even
a
canary
indeed
for
want
of
proper
instruction
a
large
number
of
the
human
race
as
they
are
known
in
this
damp
and
foggy
island
are
ill
to
live
wi
and
no
one
would
attempt
it
but
for
charity
and
the
love
of
god
now
who
but
women
are
responsible
for
the
training
of
men
if
the
mother
has
neglected
her
obvious
duty
in
training
her
son
to
be
a
livable
portion
of
humanity
who
but
the
girls
must
take
up
her
lost
opportunities
it
is
with
the
class
of
men
whose
mothers
neglected
to
train
them
in
the
art
of
living
that
we
have
to
deal
the
man
with
whom
feminine
influence
refining
broadening
softening
graciously
smoothing
out
and
generously
polishing
off
sharp
mental
corners
has
had
no
part
it
need
not
necessarily
mean
men
who
have
not
encountered
feminine
influence
but
it
does
mean
those
who
never
have
yielded
to
it
the
natural
and
conceit
of
youth
may
have
been
the
barrier
which
prevented
their
yielding
there
is
a
time
when
the
youth
of
twenty
knows
more
than
any
one
on
earth
could
teach
him
and
more
than
he
ever
will
know
again
a
time
when
no
matter
how
kind
his
heart
he
is
incased
in
a
mental
haughtiness
before
which
plain
wisdom
is
dumb
but
a
time
will
come
when
the
keenness
of
some
girl
stiletto
of
wit
will
prick
the
empty
bubble
of
his
flamboyant
egoism
and
he
will
for
the
first
time
learn
that
he
is
but
an
untrained
man
under
this
elastic
classification
does
not
obtain
with
either
geniuses
or
fools
it
deals
with
the
average
man
as
the
average
girl
knows
him
and
may
refer
to
every
man
in
her
acquaintance
or
only
to
one
it
certainly
refer
to
one
misery
loves
company
to
such
an
extent
that
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
there
was
any
girl
living
who
did
not
occasionally
have
to
grapple
with
the
problem
of
at
least
one
man
in
the
raw
if
only
for
her
own
discipline
you
can
not
argue
with
the
untrained
man
under
in
fact
i
never
argue
with
anybody
either
man
or
woman
because
women
are
not
reasonable
beings
and
men
are
too
reasonable
i
never
am
willing
to
follow
a
chain
of
reasoning
to
its
logical
conclusion
because
if
i
do
men
can
make
me
admit
so
many
things
that
are
not
true
i
abhor
a
syllogism
alas
how
often
have
i
picked
my
cautious
way
through
of
one
only
to
sit
down
at
the
critical
moment
declaring
i
would
not
go
another
step
and
then
to
hear
some
argumentative
man
cry
but
you
admitted
all
previous
steps
do
you
know
that
this
naturally
follow
well
perhaps
it
follow
only
i
do
believe
it
is
true
it
may
be
very
clever
of
the
men
to
reason
and
perhaps
i
am
very
stupid
not
to
be
able
to
admit
the
truth
of
their
conclusions
but
i
feel
like
declaring
with
josh
billings
i
rather
not
know
so
much
than
to
know
so
much
that
so
conversation
with
the
untrained
man
under
is
equally
impossible
because
he
never
converses
he
only
talks
and
your
chief
accomplishment
of
being
a
good
listener
is
entirely
thrown
away
on
him
because
a
mere
talker
never
cares
whether
you
listen
or
not
as
long
as
you
do
not
interrupt
him
he
only
wants
the
floor
and
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
it
is
the
trained
man
over
who
can
converse
and
who
wishes
you
to
respond
the
untrained
man
desires
to
be
amused
the
trained
man
wishes
to
amuse
a
man
under
is
in
this
world
to
be
made
happy
the
man
over
tries
to
make
you
happy
there
is
no
use
of
uttering
a
protest
you
simply
must
wait
and
let
life
take
it
out
of
him
the
man
under
is
being
trained
in
a
thousand
ways
every
day
that
he
lives
some
learn
more
quickly
than
others
it
depends
on
the
type
of
man
and
on
the
length
of
time
he
is
willing
to
remain
in
the
raw
you
can
do
little
to
help
him
if
you
are
the
first
girl
to
take
a
hand
at
him
you
can
but
prepare
him
to
be
a
little
more
amenable
to
the
next
girl
his
mind
is
not
on
you
it
is
centred
on
himself
you
are
only
an
entity
to
him
not
an
individual
he
cares
nothing
for
your
likes
and
dislikes
your
cares
or
hopes
or
fears
he
only
wishes
you
to
be
pretty
and
well
dressed
have
a
mind
if
you
will
he
will
not
know
it
have
a
heart
and
a
soul
they
do
not
concern
him
because
he
can
not
see
them
he
likes
to
have
you
you
are
a
girl
to
him
that
all
the
eyes
of
the
untrained
man
under
are
never
taken
off
himself
they
are
always
turned
in
he
is
studying
himself
first
and
foremost
and
the
world
at
large
is
interesting
to
him
only
inasmuch
as
it
bears
relation
to
himself
as
the
pivotal
point
he
fully
indorses
pope
line
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
and
he
is
that
man
join
in
his
pursuit
if
you
will
show
the
wildest
enthusiasm
in
his
golf
record
or
how
many
lumps
of
sugar
he
takes
in
his
coffee
and
he
will
evince
neither
surprise
nor
gratitude
for
your
interest
you
are
only
showing
your
good
taste
try
to
talk
to
the
untrained
man
under
upon
any
subject
except
himself
bait
him
with
different
topics
of
universal
interest
and
try
to
persuade
him
to
leave
his
own
point
of
view
long
enough
to
look
through
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
then
notice
the
hopeless
persistence
with
which
he
avoids
your
dexterous
efforts
and
mentally
lies
down
to
worry
his
ego
again
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
the
conceit
of
one
of
these
men
is
the
most
colossal
specimen
of
psychological
architecture
in
existence
as
a
social
study
when
i
have
him
under
the
microscope
i
can
enjoy
this
i
revel
in
it
just
as
i
do
in
a
view
of
the
ocean
or
the
heavens
at
night
anything
so
vast
that
i
can
not
see
to
the
end
of
it
it
suggests
eternity
or
space
but
oh
what
i
have
suffered
from
a
mental
contact
with
this
phase
of
him
in
society
sometimes
he
really
is
ignorant
has
no
brains
at
all
and
then
my
suffering
is
lingering
sometimes
he
really
knows
a
great
deal
has
the
making
of
a
man
in
him
only
it
lies
fallow
for
want
of
training
and
then
my
suffering
is
acute
when
success
business
or
social
or
athletic
or
literary
or
artistic
comes
to
the
untrained
man
under
it
comes
pitifully
near
being
his
ruin
the
adulation
of
the
world
is
more
intoxicating
and
more
deadly
than
to
drink
absinthe
out
of
a
stein
more
insidious
than
opium
more
fatal
than
poison
it
unsettles
the
steadiest
brain
and
feeds
the
ego
with
a
food
which
at
first
he
deemed
nectar
and
ambrosia
but
which
he
soon
comes
to
feel
is
the
staff
of
life
and
no
more
than
he
deserves
with
success
should
come
the
determination
be
you
man
or
woman
to
fall
upon
your
knees
every
day
and
pray
heaven
for
strength
to
keep
from
believing
what
people
tell
you
so
that
you
still
may
be
bearable
to
your
friends
and
livable
to
your
family
i
know
that
all
this
will
fall
unkindly
upon
the
ears
of
many
a
worthy
man
under
whose
charm
is
still
in
embryo
and
that
unless
he
is
very
clever
he
will
be
mortally
offended
and
never
believe
my
solemn
assertion
that
i
am
the
stanchest
friend
the
man
of
possibilities
has
let
him
take
care
how
he
resents
my
amiable
brutality
or
how
he
denounces
me
as
his
enemy
for
if
i
were
not
interested
in
the
untrained
man
under
i
would
bother
with
him
would
i
i
know
too
that
a
diplomatic
feminine
contingency
will
raise
a
howl
of
protest
and
will
read
this
aloud
to
men
under
for
the
express
purpose
of
disclaiming
all
complicity
with
such
heterodox
views
and
doubtless
will
be
able
to
make
the
men
believe
them
tactful
girls
are
a
necessity
and
i
approve
of
them
i
do
not
in
the
least
mind
their
disclaiming
my
views
to
specific
men
especially
if
i
can
catch
their
eye
for
one
subtle
moment
when
the
men
are
not
looking
on
this
subject
there
is
a
certain
delicately
veiled
comprehending
mental
going
the
rounds
of
the
girls
indicating
our
comradeship
and
unanimity
of
thought
quite
as
understandingly
as
the
fraternal
grip
stands
for
fellowship
among
masons
we
girls
have
been
thinking
these
things
for
a
long
time
and
with
this
declaration
of
independence
the
shackles
will
fall
from
many
a
girl
soul
because
another
girl
has
dared
to
speak
out
in
meeting
of
course
i
know
too
that
girls
with
nice
brothers
and
cousins
and
husbands
under
will
also
offer
violent
protest
i
am
perfectly
willing
doubtless
their
feminine
influence
has
circumvented
nature
to
such
an
extent
that
no
one
would
suspect
that
their
men
were
under
i
only
beg
of
them
to
remember
that
i
am
not
discussing
men
or
widowers
both
of
these
types
are
as
near
perfection
as
a
man
can
become
a
man
whom
girls
have
trained
is
really
modest
even
at
twenty
he
does
not
think
that
he
knows
it
all
he
is
willing
to
admit
that
his
father
and
mother
have
brains
and
that
thirty
years
experience
entitles
them
to
a
hearing
he
also
is
willing
to
give
the
girls
a
show
to
humor
them
to
find
them
interesting
as
studies
but
never
to
claim
to
understand
them
in
short
he
has
many
of
the
charming
qualities
of
the
man
over
and
the
widower
that
is
the
man
who
is
but
heaven
help
the
man
who
is
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
that
the
untrained
man
under
at
his
worst
is
of
no
use
in
this
world
he
is
excellent
for
a
i
have
used
a
number
of
them
very
successfully
in
this
way
but
i
know
the
awful
thought
has
already
pierced
some
people
brains
what
if
the
man
under
does
not
dance
sometimes
an
untrained
man
under
will
actually
have
the
audacity
to
say
to
me
that
he
takes
small
pleasure
in
society
because
the
girls
he
meets
are
so
silly
and
he
must
use
in
order
to
meet
them
on
their
own
ground
i
am
aghast
at
his
temerity
as
he
too
will
be
when
he
has
heard
our
side
of
the
subject
we
girls
never
have
allowed
ourselves
the
luxury
of
vindicating
ourselves
or
refuting
this
charge
it
is
the
clever
girl
who
suffers
most
of
all
not
the
brilliant
meteoric
girl
but
just
the
ordinarily
clever
girl
as
other
girls
know
her
it
is
this
sort
of
a
girl
who
drags
upon
my
sympathies
because
she
occupies
an
anomalous
position
being
a
real
woman
she
likes
to
be
liked
she
wishes
to
please
men
we
all
do
but
what
kind
of
men
are
we
to
please
untrained
men
under
owing
to
the
horrible
prevalence
of
these
men
some
girls
become
neither
fish
nor
flesh
nor
good
red
herring
they
see
their
silly
sisters
followed
and
admired
they
know
either
how
shallow
these
girls
are
or
how
cleverly
hypocritical
clever
girls
are
also
human
they
love
to
go
about
and
wear
pretty
clothes
and
dance
and
be
admired
quite
as
much
as
anybody
the
result
is
that
they
adopt
the
only
course
left
to
them
and
bringing
themselves
down
to
the
level
of
the
men
feign
a
frivolity
and
a
levity
which
occasionally
call
forth
from
a
thinking
man
a
criticism
which
is
in
a
sense
totally
undeserved
what
will
not
the
untrained
man
under
have
to
answer
for
on
the
day
of
judgment
it
is
of
no
use
to
argue
about
this
state
of
things
facts
are
facts
men
make
no
secret
of
the
kind
of
women
they
want
us
to
be
we
get
preached
at
from
pulpits
and
lectured
at
from
platforms
and
written
about
by
the
saunterer
and
the
man
about
town
and
the
one
who
knows
it
all
telling
us
how
to
be
womanly
how
to
look
to
please
men
how
to
behave
to
please
men
and
how
to
save
our
souls
to
please
men
until
if
we
were
not
a
sweet
amiable
set
we
would
rebel
as
a
sex
and
declare
that
we
thought
we
were
lovely
just
the
way
we
were
and
that
we
were
not
going
to
change
for
anybody
you
lords
of
creation
ought
to
be
very
complaisant
or
else
very
much
ashamed
of
yourselves
you
send
in
an
order
the
kind
of
girl
that
i
like
is
a
methodist
without
bangs
and
some
nice
girl
begins
to
look
up
methodist
tenets
and
buys
invisible
hairpins
and
side
combs
or
you
say
give
me
an
athletic
girl
and
presto
some
girl
who
would
much
rather
read
buys
a
wheel
and
learns
golf
and
lets
out
the
waists
to
her
gowns
and
revels
in
tan
and
freckles
we
do
what
you
men
want
us
to
and
then
when
you
complain
about
our
lack
of
brains
that
we
can
not
discuss
current
events
and
that
you
have
to
give
us
society
i
feel
like
saying
well
whose
fault
is
it
if
you
demand
brains
we
will
cultivate
them
if
you
want
good
looks
we
will
try
to
scare
up
some
if
you
want
nobility
we
will
let
you
know
how
much
we
have
concealed
about
us
often
it
is
not
that
we
are
not
secretly
much
more
of
women
and
better
and
cleverer
women
than
you
think
us
but
there
is
no
call
for
such
wares
so
we
lay
character
and
brain
on
the
shelves
to
mildew
and
fill
the
with
confectionery
and
illusion
we
supply
the
demand
we
always
have
supplied
it
and
we
always
will
of
course
some
of
us
get
very
much
disgusted
with
the
débutantes
but
aside
from
the
great
superiority
they
have
over
girls
with
thinking
powers
in
regard
to
the
number
of
men
who
admire
them
for
all
men
admire
cooing
girls
with
dimples
aside
from
this
i
say
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
their
behalf
do
you
believe
you
dear
unsuspicious
men
who
dote
upon
their
pliability
and
the
trustfulness
of
their
innocent
limpid
blue
or
gaze
which
meets
your
own
with
such
implied
flattery
to
your
superior
strength
and
intelligence
do
you
believe
for
one
moment
that
the
simple
little
dears
do
not
know
exactly
the
part
they
are
playing
they
are
twice
as
clever
as
the
cleverest
of
you
they
feel
that
they
are
needed
just
as
they
are
the
fashionable
schools
are
turning
them
out
every
year
exactly
as
the
untrained
men
under
would
wish
them
to
be
they
know
this
therefore
they
remain
as
art
has
made
them
feeling
themselves
admired
by
the
class
of
men
they
most
wish
to
attract
they
have
no
incentive
to
improve
and
yet
i
suppose
untrained
men
under
have
their
use
in
the
world
aside
from
the
part
they
play
in
the
discipline
of
discriminating
young
women
girls
even
marry
these
men
lovely
girls
too
clever
girls
girls
who
know
a
hundred
times
more
than
their
husbands
and
are
ten
times
finer
grained
i
wonder
if
they
love
them
if
they
are
satisfied
with
them
if
of
the
soul
is
not
a
bitter
thing
to
bear
i
am
always
wondering
why
girls
marry
them
every
week
brings
me
knowledge
that
some
lovely
girl
i
know
has
found
another
man
under
or
that
some
of
my
men
friends
of
that
persuasion
have
married
girls
it
does
not
surprise
me
so
much
when
girls
from
another
city
marry
them
most
men
do
not
like
to
write
letters
and
visits
are
only
for
over
sunday
men
are
always
saying
well
why
do
you
tell
us
the
kind
of
men
you
would
like
us
to
be
and
their
attitude
when
they
say
it
is
with
their
thumbs
in
the
of
their
waistcoats
when
a
man
is
thoroughly
satisfied
with
himself
he
always
expands
his
chest
there
is
something
very
funny
to
me
in
that
question
because
i
suppose
they
really
think
they
would
change
to
please
us
i
do
not
mind
talking
about
it
because
i
am
sociable
and
i
like
conversation
but
i
never
for
a
moment
dream
that
they
will
do
it
they
intend
to
and
their
inclination
is
always
to
please
us
even
to
spoil
us
but
they
either
can
not
or
will
not
change
and
they
think
if
they
can
refuse
pleasantly
and
mentally
chuck
us
under
the
chin
and
make
us
smile
that
they
have
succeeded
in
getting
our
minds
off
a
troublesome
subject
of
course
it
is
partly
our
fault
that
we
do
not
insist
but
no
one
wants
to
be
disagreeable
therefore
we
choose
personal
discomfort
for
ourselves
rather
than
to
demand
radical
changes
in
the
men
which
might
bring
on
contention
but
women
wish
to
please
men
aside
from
their
power
of
winning
them
whereas
if
men
can
get
the
girls
without
any
change
on
their
part
they
consider
themselves
a
howling
success
but
they
might
be
a
little
bit
surprised
if
they
could
read
the
minds
of
these
very
wives
whom
they
have
won
whose
often
may
be
only
to
improve
them
so
that
they
will
make
some
other
woman
the
kind
of
a
husband
they
should
have
made
at
first
and
then
to
lie
down
and
die
so
let
men
beware
how
they
criticise
us
unfavorably
no
matter
what
their
ages
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
be
we
frivolous
or
serious
vain
or
sensible
clever
or
stupid
rich
or
poor
we
are
what
the
american
man
has
made
us
we
are
supremely
grateful
to
him
for
the
most
part
for
he
has
literally
made
us
what
we
are
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
but
let
him
beware
how
he
cavils
at
his
own
handiwork
is
not
for
the
untrained
man
under
to
complain
of
us
when
now
he
knows
why
we
are
so
i
not
denyin
that
women
are
foolish
says
george
eliot
god
almighty
made
to
match
the
men
the
philosophy
of
clothes
last
night
in
blue
my
little
love
was
dressed
and
as
she
walked
the
room
in
maiden
grace
i
looked
into
her
fair
and
smiling
face
and
said
that
blue
became
my
darling
best
but
when
this
morn
a
spotless
virgin
vest
and
robe
of
white
did
the
blue
one
displace
she
seemed
a
and
i
was
space
she
filled
my
soul
as
fill
the
west
and
so
it
is
that
changing
day
by
day
changing
her
robe
but
not
her
loveliness
whether
the
gown
be
blue
or
white
or
gray
i
deem
that
one
her
most
becoming
dress
the
truth
is
this
in
any
robe
or
way
i
love
her
just
the
same
and
can
not
love
her
less
if
you
are
interested
in
the
spectacle
of
letting
people
paint
their
own
portraits
at
the
same
time
entirely
unconscious
that
they
are
doing
so
ask
a
number
of
women
and
girls
whether
they
dress
to
please
men
or
other
women
and
then
listen
carefully
to
what
they
say
and
watch
their
faces
well
while
they
are
saying
it
most
of
the
girls
will
say
they
dress
to
please
women
and
the
reason
i
ask
you
to
watch
their
faces
is
that
you
may
see
the
subtle
changes
going
on
by
which
they
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
telling
the
truth
women
nice
sweet
women
the
kind
know
seldom
tell
a
real
untruth
but
they
have
a
way
of
persuading
themselves
that
what
they
are
about
to
say
is
the
truth
women
must
believe
in
themselves
before
they
can
hope
to
make
other
people
believe
in
them
therefore
they
have
themselves
to
persuade
first
of
all
now
when
men
are
going
to
utter
an
untruth
they
never
care
whether
they
believe
it
or
not
as
long
as
they
can
make
other
people
believe
it
and
the
brutal
honesty
of
man
is
only
brutal
want
of
tact
that
poor
patient
misused
word
honesty
how
sick
it
must
get
of
its
abuse
yes
girls
really
believe
i
suppose
that
they
dress
for
other
girls
but
they
do
not
they
dress
for
men
and
only
experience
will
teach
them
the
highest
wisdom
in
the
matter
but
that
they
can
not
acquire
until
they
believe
that
only
another
woman
will
know
just
how
well
they
are
dressed
and
above
all
whether
doucet
turned
them
out
or
a
in
the
house
at
two
dollars
a
day
men
only
take
in
the
effect
women
know
how
the
effect
is
produced
of
course
now
i
am
speaking
of
the
general
run
of
men
and
women
neither
the
man
who
clerked
at
cash
silk
nor
the
one
who
pays
his
bills
in
paris
but
the
man
in
his
native
state
of
charming
ignorance
of
materials
the
man
who
always
suggests
a
gusset
as
a
remedy
for
too
scant
a
gown
who
calls
insertion
tatting
and
who
in
setting
out
for
the
opera
will
tell
his
wife
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
although
she
may
have
on
and
diamonds
in
his
more
modern
aspect
he
tells
you
that
a
girl
at
the
junior
promenade
had
on
a
blue
dress
with
feathers
around
her
neck
which
you
must
translate
into
meaning
anything
from
blue
satin
to
organdie
and
that
between
dances
she
wore
a
feather
boa
it
is
the
effect
only
that
men
take
in
and
when
a
man
goes
into
ecstasies
over
a
gown
of
pale
green
on
a
hot
day
just
because
you
look
so
cool
and
fresh
in
it
when
you
know
that
you
paid
but
forty
cents
a
yard
for
it
and
only
nods
when
you
show
him
your
velvet
and
ermine
wrap
which
cost
you
two
hundred
dollars
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
if
it
pays
to
dress
for
him
women
know
this
from
a
sorrowful
experience
girls
have
to
learn
it
for
themselves
a
of
white
tarlatan
made
up
over
white
paper
cambric
with
a
white
sash
will
satisfy
a
man
quite
as
well
as
a
paris
muslin
trimmed
with
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
valenciennes
lace
and
made
up
over
silk
most
of
them
would
never
know
the
difference
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
sorry
for
these
men
or
not
it
must
be
lovely
not
to
agonize
and
plan
and
worry
to
have
everything
the
best
of
its
kind
i
would
like
to
take
in
only
the
effect
and
never
know
why
i
was
pleased
too
much
analysis
is
death
to
unmitigated
rapture
you
always
are
haunted
by
knowing
exactly
what
is
lacking
and
just
how
it
could
be
remedied
but
these
dear
men
are
singularly
deluded
in
many
ways
and
upon
these
delusions
clever
women
play
as
a
master
plays
upon
an
organ
and
young
girls
who
have
not
had
time
to
study
into
the
philosophy
of
it
how
should
the
poor
things
know
that
clothes
have
any
philosophy
as
usual
have
to
suffer
for
it
one
of
these
delusions
is
the
simple
white
muslin
delusion
when
a
man
speaks
of
a
simple
white
muslin
in
the
softly
admiring
tone
which
he
generally
adopts
to
go
with
it
he
means
anything
on
earth
in
the
line
of
a
thin
light
stuff
which
produces
in
his
mind
the
effect
of
youth
and
innocence
a
or
a
cotton
is
to
him
a
simple
white
muslin
now
a
word
with
you
you
dear
unsophisticated
man
i
have
heard
you
with
the
sound
of
your
salary
ringing
in
your
ears
gurgle
and
splash
about
a
girl
who
wears
simple
white
muslins
to
balls
and
i
have
heard
you
set
down
as
extravagant
and
too
rich
for
your
purse
the
girl
who
wears
silk
there
is
no
more
extravagant
or
troublesome
gown
in
the
world
than
what
you
call
a
simple
white
muslin
in
the
first
place
it
never
is
muslin
unless
it
is
paris
muslin
which
is
no
joke
if
you
are
thinking
of
paying
for
it
yourself
as
it
necessitates
a
silk
lining
which
costs
more
than
the
outside
if
it
is
trimmed
with
lace
that
would
take
as
much
of
your
salary
as
the
coal
for
all
winter
would
come
to
if
trimmed
with
ribbons
they
must
be
changed
often
to
freshen
the
gown
whose
only
beauty
is
its
freshness
deliver
me
from
a
soiled
or
stringy
white
if
it
can
be
worn
five
times
during
the
winter
the
girl
is
either
a
careful
dancer
or
else
a
wallflower
in
either
case
after
every
wearing
she
must
have
it
pressed
out
and
put
away
as
daintily
as
if
it
were
all
of
which
is
the
greatest
nuisance
on
earth
often
such
a
gown
is
torn
all
to
pieces
the
first
time
it
is
worn
scores
of
simple
white
muslin
at
a
hundred
dollars
apiece
are
only
worn
once
or
twice
now
take
the
extravagant
girl
with
her
flowered
taffeta
silk
or
plain
satin
or
brocade
dress
there
is
at
once
the
effect
of
richness
and
elegance
no
matter
how
sweet
and
pretty
she
is
you
at
once
decide
that
you
never
could
afford
to
dress
her
but
that
taffeta
cost
perhaps
only
a
dollar
a
yard
the
satin
possibly
a
dollar
and
a
half
they
require
almost
no
trimming
because
the
material
is
so
handsome
and
the
effect
must
be
as
simple
as
possible
such
a
gown
never
need
be
lined
with
silk
unless
you
wish
to
do
it
many
a
girl
gets
up
such
a
gown
for
fifty
or
sixty
dollars
and
then
think
of
the
service
that
there
is
in
it
it
does
not
tear
it
does
not
crush
when
she
comes
home
she
looks
as
fresh
as
when
she
started
when
it
soils
at
the
edge
of
the
skirt
she
has
it
cleaned
and
there
she
is
with
a
new
dress
again
do
you
call
that
extravagant
why
my
dear
sirs
it
is
only
the
very
rich
who
can
afford
to
wear
simple
white
muslins
there
is
a
hollowness
about
having
a
man
praise
your
gowns
when
you
know
he
does
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
a
man
praises
your
clothes
he
always
is
praising
you
in
them
you
never
will
hear
a
man
praise
even
the
good
dressing
of
a
woman
he
dislikes
while
girls
who
positively
hate
another
girl
often
will
add
but
she
certainly
does
know
how
to
dress
and
so
the
experienced
woman
wears
her
expensive
clothes
for
other
women
and
produces
her
effects
for
men
she
wears
scarlet
on
a
cold
or
raw
day
and
the
eyes
of
the
men
light
up
when
they
see
her
it
makes
her
look
cheerful
and
bright
and
warm
she
wears
gray
when
she
wants
to
look
demure
let
a
man
beware
of
a
woman
in
silvery
gray
she
looks
so
quiet
and
and
gentle
that
she
has
disarmed
him
before
she
has
spoken
one
word
and
he
will
snuggle
down
beside
her
and
let
her
turn
his
mind
and
his
wrong
side
out
a
woman
could
not
look
designing
in
light
gray
if
she
tried
he
dotes
upon
the
girl
in
pale
blue
pale
blue
naturally
suggests
to
his
mind
the
sort
of
girl
who
can
wear
it
which
is
generally
a
blonde
with
soft
fluffy
hair
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
appealing
trustful
eyes
did
you
ever
notice
that
men
always
instinctively
put
confidence
in
a
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
have
their
suspicions
of
a
girl
with
brilliant
black
ones
and
will
you
kindly
tell
me
why
is
it
that
the
limpid
blue
eye
transparent
and
gentle
suggests
all
the
soft
womanly
virtues
and
because
he
thinks
he
can
see
through
it
clear
down
into
that
girl
soul
that
she
is
the
kind
of
girl
he
fancies
she
is
i
think
it
is
but
some
of
the
greatest
little
frauds
i
know
are
the
purry
kitteny
girls
with
big
innocent
blue
eyes
blazing
black
eyes
and
the
rich
warm
colors
which
women
have
to
wear
suggest
energy
and
brilliance
and
no
end
of
intellect
men
look
into
such
eyes
and
seem
not
to
be
able
to
see
below
the
surface
they
have
not
the
pleasure
of
a
long
deep
gaze
into
immeasurable
depths
and
so
they
think
her
designing
and
clever
and
god
save
the
mark
even
intellectual
when
perhaps
she
has
a
wealth
of
love
and
devotion
and
heroism
stored
up
behind
that
impulsive
disposition
and
those
dazzling
black
eyes
which
would
do
and
dare
more
in
a
minute
for
some
man
she
had
set
that
great
heart
of
hers
upon
than
your
tranquil
blonde
would
do
in
forty
years
a
mere
question
of
pigment
in
the
eye
has
settled
many
a
man
fate
in
life
and
established
him
with
a
wife
who
turned
out
to
be
very
different
from
the
girl
he
fondly
thought
he
was
getting
yet
whenever
i
complain
to
experienced
married
women
of
how
discouraging
it
is
to
wear
your
good
clothes
for
unappreciative
men
they
beg
me
not
to
be
guilty
of
the
heresy
of
wishing
things
different
if
they
have
married
one
of
the
noticing
kind
they
tell
me
harrowing
tales
of
gorgeous
costumes
having
been
cast
aside
because
these
critical
men
made
fun
of
or
were
prejudiced
against
them
and
made
remarks
and
they
point
with
envy
to
whose
husband
never
knows
what
she
has
on
but
who
thinks
she
looks
lovely
in
everything
so
that
she
is
at
liberty
to
dress
as
she
pleases
when
a
woman
defers
to
her
husband
taste
she
sometimes
is
the
woman
in
the
room
and
sometimes
another
woman
dressing
according
to
another
man
taste
is
the
so
you
see
you
never
can
tell
de
mule
do
kick
to
no
rule
there
is
something
rather
pathetic
to
me
about
a
man
being
so
ignorant
of
why
a
woman
dress
is
beautiful
but
only
the
effect
remaining
in
his
memory
he
remembers
how
she
looked
on
a
certain
day
in
a
certain
gown
he
thinks
he
remembers
her
dress
he
thinks
he
would
know
it
again
if
he
saw
it
but
the
truth
is
that
he
is
remembering
the
woman
herself
her
face
her
voice
her
eyes
above
all
what
she
said
and
how
she
said
it
if
she
wore
a
scarlet
ribbon
in
her
dark
hair
a
red
rose
in
another
woman
hair
will
most
unaccountably
bring
it
all
back
to
him
and
he
will
not
know
why
he
suddenly
sees
the
whole
picture
rise
out
of
the
past
before
his
eyes
nor
why
his
throat
aches
with
the
memory
of
it
i
know
one
of
these
men
whose
descriptions
of
a
woman
dress
are
one
of
the
experiences
of
a
lifetime
he
loves
the
word
bombazine
his
mother
must
have
worn
a
gown
of
black
bombazine
during
his
impressionable
age
and
he
never
will
be
successful
in
describing
a
modern
gown
until
bombazines
again
become
the
rage
this
same
dear
man
brought
back
to
his
invalid
wife
a
description
of
a
fashionable
noon
wedding
which
consisted
of
the
single
item
that
the
bride
wore
a
blue
alpaca
bonnet
it
really
would
be
of
interest
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
to
know
what
suggested
that
combination
to
any
intelligence
even
if
it
were
masculine
i
have
more
evidence
to
go
on
however
when
i
wonder
why
the
idea
of
the
cost
penetrates
this
same
man
brain
when
shown
a
new
gown
by
any
member
of
his
family
all
of
whom
he
is
weak
enough
to
adore
his
daughter
will
say
papa
do
look
here
just
one
minute
how
do
you
like
my
new
gown
and
the
answer
never
varies
very
pretty
indeed
i
hope
it
paid
for
he
will
say
that
of
a
cotton
frock
made
two
years
ago
he
never
knows
of
a
silk
or
of
a
of
the
newest
make
the
fashion
produces
no
impression
upon
him
nor
the
material
nor
the
cut
but
let
his
daughter
put
on
any
kind
of
a
pale
green
dress
and
stand
before
him
with
the
question
papa
how
do
you
like
my
new
gown
while
he
is
raising
his
head
from
his
book
he
begins
the
old
formula
very
pretty
i
hope
then
he
stops
and
says
i
have
seen
that
dress
before
child
you
grow
to
look
more
like
your
mother
every
day
of
your
life
and
there
is
a
little
break
in
his
voice
and
before
he
goes
on
reading
he
takes
off
his
glasses
and
wipes
them
and
looks
out
of
the
window
without
seeing
anything
and
sits
very
still
for
a
moment
it
was
the
sight
of
the
pale
green
dress
when
he
came
home
from
the
war
his
lovely
young
wife
whom
he
lost
when
she
was
still
young
and
beautiful
came
to
meet
him
holding
her
baby
son
in
her
arms
for
his
father
to
see
and
she
had
worn
a
pale
green
gown
why
certain
kinds
of
clothes
are
associated
in
the
public
mind
with
certain
kinds
of
women
is
to
me
an
amusing
mystery
why
are
old
maids
always
supposed
to
wear
black
silks
and
why
are
they
always
supposed
to
be
thin
the
old
maids
i
mean
not
the
silks
why
are
literary
women
always
supposed
to
be
frayed
at
the
edges
and
why
if
they
keep
up
with
the
fashions
and
wear
do
people
say
in
an
exasperatingly
astonished
tone
can
that
woman
write
books
why
not
pray
does
a
fragment
of
genius
corrupt
the
aesthetic
sense
is
writing
a
hardening
process
must
you
wear
shabby
boots
and
carry
a
baggy
umbrella
just
because
you
can
write
not
a
bit
of
it
little
as
some
of
you
men
may
think
it
literary
women
have
souls
and
a
woman
with
a
soul
must
of
necessity
love
laces
and
ruffled
petticoats
and
high
heels
and
rosettes
otherwise
i
question
her
possession
of
a
soul
woman
rights
in
love
she
has
laughed
as
softly
as
if
she
sighed
she
has
counted
six
and
over
of
a
purse
well
filled
and
a
heart
well
tried
oh
each
a
worthy
lover
they
her
time
for
her
soul
must
slip
when
the
world
has
set
the
grooving
she
will
lie
to
none
with
her
fair
red
lip
but
love
seeks
truer
loving
unless
you
can
muse
in
a
crowd
all
day
on
the
absent
face
that
fixed
you
unless
you
can
love
as
the
angels
may
with
the
breadth
of
heaven
betwixt
you
unless
you
can
dream
that
his
faith
is
fast
through
behooving
and
unbehooving
unless
you
can
die
when
the
dream
is
past
oh
never
call
it
loving
in
love
a
woman
first
right
is
to
be
protected
from
her
friends
while
she
considers
the
man
whom
she
contemplates
loving
the
blundering
of
vitally
interested
friends
has
spoiled
many
a
promising
love
affair
which
might
have
resulted
in
a
marriage
so
much
above
the
ordinary
that
it
could
be
termed
satisfactory
even
by
the
most
captious
at
no
time
in
a
girl
life
has
she
a
greater
right
to
work
out
her
own
salvation
in
fear
and
trembling
than
during
the
period
known
among
girls
as
making
up
her
mind
if
she
is
the
right
kind
of
a
girl
honest
and
delicate
minded
it
is
to
be
talked
about
and
sacrilege
to
be
talked
to
then
the
bloom
is
on
the
grape
which
a
rude
touch
mars
forever
yet
these
kind
friends
never
think
of
the
delicate
influences
at
work
in
the
girl
soul
or
that
the
instinct
to
hide
her
real
interest
in
the
man
precludes
the
possibility
of
her
daring
to
ask
to
be
let
alone
so
they
in
their
and
ambition
either
make
the
path
of
love
so
easy
and
inevitable
that
all
the
zest
is
taken
out
of
it
for
both
for
lovers
never
want
somebody
to
go
ahead
and
baste
the
problem
for
them
they
want
to
it
for
themselves
as
they
go
along
or
else
by
critical
nagging
and
balancing
the
eligibility
of
one
suitor
against
another
these
friends
so
harass
and
upset
the
poor
girl
that
she
does
know
which
man
she
wants
and
so
turns
her
back
upon
all
in
point
of
fact
when
a
man
is
in
love
and
a
girl
does
not
yet
know
her
own
mind
when
she
is
weighing
out
their
adaptability
and
balancing
his
love
for
football
against
her
passion
for
browning
during
the
delicate
tentative
period
when
the
most
affectionate
solicitude
from
friends
is
an
irritation
there
ought
to
be
a
law
banishing
the
interested
couple
to
an
island
peopled
with
strangers
who
would
not
discover
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
until
it
was
too
late
to
spoil
it
woman
rights
i
certainly
agree
with
the
men
who
think
that
those
words
have
a
masculine
assertive
belligerent
sound
equal
suffrage
is
much
more
and
we
are
by
way
of
getting
all
we
wish
of
the
men
on
any
subject
under
the
gentlest
title
by
which
it
may
be
called
strange
how
with
strong
men
force
never
avails
but
the
softest
methods
are
the
surest
and
swiftest
however
equal
suffrage
wide
as
it
is
is
not
all
that
i
wish
it
does
well
enough
but
it
does
not
cover
the
entire
ground
i
never
clamored
very
much
for
women
to
be
recognized
as
the
equals
of
men
either
in
politics
or
in
love
because
if
i
had
clamored
at
all
i
should
have
clamored
for
infinitely
more
than
that
should
have
clamored
for
men
to
recognize
us
as
their
superiors
and
not
for
equal
rights
with
themselves
but
for
more
many
more
rights
than
they
ever
dreamed
of
possessing
is
not
justice
i
crave
but
mercy
is
not
equality
but
chivalry
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
from
public
opinion
clear
back
to
the
age
of
chivalry
men
never
have
been
inclined
to
deal
out
justice
to
women
it
is
their
watchword
with
each
other
but
with
women
it
always
is
either
injustice
or
mercy
and
in
spite
of
all
wrongs
and
all
abuses
i
say
heaven
bless
the
men
that
this
is
so
human
nature
is
more
fundamental
than
customs
and
what
would
become
of
women
if
we
only
got
our
exact
deserts
or
had
absolute
justice
dealt
to
us
either
by
men
or
other
women
or
on
the
judgment
day
in
these
latter
days
of
this
progressive
woman
century
however
the
most
thoughtful
men
are
valiant
enough
to
themselves
to
the
idea
of
woman
development
and
allow
her
equality
in
progressive
thought
at
the
same
time
maintaining
the
chivalry
of
their
attitude
towards
her
if
she
asks
for
justice
at
the
hands
of
these
glorious
men
she
will
get
it
and
they
will
uncover
in
her
presence
and
throw
away
their
cigars
while
they
are
dispensing
it
equality
to
them
does
not
mean
either
rudeness
or
insolence
they
are
always
gentlemen
it
requires
bravery
on
their
part
to
take
this
ground
because
the
sentiment
has
not
as
yet
grown
popular
but
a
new
man
has
been
created
by
the
development
of
the
new
woman
and
he
is
the
highest
type
we
have
courtesy
wins
woman
as
well
as
valor
may
but
he
that
closes
both
is
perfect
woman
rights
why
the
very
first
right
we
expect
is
to
be
treated
better
than
anybody
else
better
than
men
treat
each
other
as
a
body
and
better
by
the
individual
man
than
he
treats
all
other
women
i
abominate
the
idea
of
equality
and
to
be
mentally
slapped
on
the
shoulder
and
told
i
am
a
good
fellow
i
shrink
from
the
idea
of
independence
and
cold
proud
isolation
with
my
emancipated
who
struggle
into
their
own
coats
unassisted
and
get
red
in
the
face
putting
on
their
own
skates
and
hang
on
to
a
strap
in
the
in
the
proud
consciousness
that
they
are
independent
and
the
equal
of
men
i
never
worry
myself
when
a
man
is
on
his
knees
in
front
of
me
tying
the
ribbons
of
my
slipper
as
to
whether
he
considers
me
his
equal
politically
or
not
it
is
sufficient
satisfaction
for
me
to
see
him
there
if
he
had
wanted
to
save
me
the
trouble
i
suppose
he
would
have
offered
he
may
even
think
i
am
not
strong
enough
for
such
an
arduous
duty
would
not
hurt
my
feelings
either
i
have
an
idea
that
he
likes
it
better
to
think
that
i
can
not
do
anything
troublesome
for
myself
than
to
believe
that
i
could
get
along
perfectly
without
him
in
fact
here
heresy
for
you
o
ye
emancipated
i
do
not
in
the
least
mind
being
dependent
on
men
provided
the
men
are
nice
enough
let
them
give
us
all
the
rights
they
want
to
i
shall
never
get
over
wanting
to
get
behind
some
man
if
i
see
a
cow
let
them
give
us
a
vote
if
they
will
i
shall
want
at
least
three
men
to
go
with
me
to
the
polls
one
to
hold
my
purse
one
to
hold
my
gloves
and
the
third
to
show
me
how
to
cast
my
vote
if
women
are
serious
in
wanting
to
vote
in
politics
why
do
they
not
apply
to
the
body
politic
the
same
methods
they
use
with
the
one
man
which
an
destiny
has
committed
to
their
keeping
if
all
the
women
in
the
world
should
make
up
their
minds
that
they
wanted
to
vote
worse
than
anything
else
on
earth
worse
even
than
they
want
their
husbands
to
go
to
church
with
them
and
each
woman
would
put
on
her
prettiest
clothes
and
cuddle
up
to
her
own
particular
man
in
her
softest
and
most
womanish
way
when
she
was
begging
him
to
get
suffrage
for
her
why
you
all
know
they
would
do
it
men
would
get
it
for
us
exactly
as
they
would
buy
us
a
pair
of
horses
have
you
men
ever
thought
about
practising
for
suffrage
in
politics
by
giving
women
suffrage
in
love
surely
you
do
not
doubt
that
should
you
do
this
it
would
not
occur
to
us
to
stuff
the
or
to
put
up
a
ticket
with
any
but
honorable
candidates
for
our
hands
we
do
not
ask
nor
wish
to
indicate
who
shall
run
for
office
let
the
men
announce
themselves
candidates
we
would
not
take
the
initiative
there
if
it
were
offered
to
us
for
a
thousand
years
all
we
ask
is
to
be
given
plenty
of
time
to
canvass
the
honor
of
the
candidates
thoroughly
to
understand
and
investigate
the
platform
with
an
eye
to
how
near
he
will
come
to
sticking
to
his
promises
after
election
and
to
be
allowed
to
cast
a
free
and
untrammelled
vote
now
men
seem
to
think
that
if
they
allowed
woman
equal
suffrage
the
bright
white
light
of
our
honesty
would
be
too
strong
a
glare
for
their
weak
eyes
so
long
accustomed
to
darkness
to
bear
um
possibly
in
politics
hardly
in
love
for
myself
i
consider
absolute
honesty
most
unpleasant
i
never
knew
any
really
nice
lovable
women
who
were
unflinchingly
honest
but
i
have
known
a
few
women
who
were
so
brutally
honest
that
i
have
most
ingloriously
fled
at
the
mention
of
their
approach
and
solaced
myself
with
a
congenial
spirit
who
is
in
the
habit
of
skirting
delicately
around
painful
truth
and
a
cozy
corner
in
which
to
abuse
the
aforesaid
carver
of
helpless
humanity
who
loves
to
draw
blood
with
her
truth
such
an
one
will
get
a
vote
in
politics
long
before
she
gets
it
in
love
no
men
need
not
fear
to
give
us
equal
suffrage
in
love
our
honesty
will
not
be
disconcerting
i
would
even
address
a
private
query
at
just
this
point
to
the
women
begging
that
the
men
will
skip
it
asking
women
where
in
the
world
we
would
find
ourselves
if
we
were
unflinchingly
honest
with
the
men
who
love
us
no
one
will
deny
that
we
would
even
countenance
a
certain
amount
of
corruption
we
fully
agree
with
those
men
who
tell
us
weakly
questioning
women
that
campaign
funds
are
a
necessity
we
never
have
been
able
to
discover
just
where
the
money
in
politics
went
to
but
the
expenses
of
a
campaign
in
our
line
are
more
in
evidence
i
doubt
if
the
most
straitlaced
puritan
will
gainsay
me
when
i
declare
that
bribery
from
the
candidates
in
the
form
of
theatres
flowers
bonbons
and
books
would
not
only
be
tolerated
but
even
in
a
modest
manner
encouraged
having
of
course
a
keen
eye
as
to
the
elasticity
of
the
campaign
fund
but
of
course
just
as
vulgar
bribery
only
catches
the
easy
and
unthinking
voter
in
politics
so
in
like
manner
would
these
evidences
of
generosity
only
capture
the
less
desirable
voter
in
love
when
you
men
are
trying
for
a
woman
vote
you
need
give
yourselves
no
uneasiness
if
she
is
worth
having
character
wins
every
time
you
do
believe
that
that
is
why
you
trust
to
bribery
to
do
it
all
and
it
is
also
why
so
many
of
you
get
the
girl
you
try
for
which
is
about
the
richest
punishment
you
could
receive
i
adore
hamlet
not
because
he
was
so
noble
as
to
give
up
his
life
to
avenge
his
father
most
foul
murder
not
because
he
was
a
chivalrous
king
arthur
to
protect
ophelia
womanly
pride
from
the
jeers
of
a
coarse
court
by
openly
declaring
that
he
had
loved
her
when
he
had
not
for
any
of
shakespeare
reasons
for
painting
him
a
hero
but
for
two
much
more
reasonable
reasons
one
that
he
said
i
myself
am
indifferent
honest
oh
the
humanity
of
hamlet
and
the
other
that
when
under
the
spell
of
her
beauty
and
in
the
tentative
interested
stage
when
he
cared
for
her
all
but
enough
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
he
had
the
wit
to
discover
that
she
was
a
fool
imagine
the
calamity
of
hamlet
married
to
ophelia
that
have
been
a
tragedy
think
of
a
man
clever
enough
to
discover
that
his
idol
was
made
of
putty
that
his
sweetheart
was
a
rosamond
vincy
hamlet
was
a
wise
man
he
withdrew
in
time
most
men
have
to
be
married
ten
years
to
discover
that
they
have
married
an
ophelia
or
a
rosamond
it
is
a
trite
saying
that
the
whole
world
is
behind
a
woman
urging
her
to
marry
but
i
find
much
to
interest
me
in
trite
sayings
i
like
to
get
hold
of
them
and
look
them
through
and
turn
them
wrong
side
out
and
pull
them
to
pieces
to
find
how
much
life
there
is
in
them
psychological
vivisection
is
not
a
subject
for
the
humane
society
a
trite
saying
has
my
sympathy
it
generally
is
stupid
and
and
consequently
is
banished
to
polite
society
and
hated
by
the
clever
and
only
because
it
possessed
a
soul
of
truth
and
a
wonderful
vitality
has
it
been
kept
from
dying
long
ago
of
a
broken
heart
books
could
be
written
of
the
truth
of
this
particular
trite
saying
the
urging
of
course
among
people
whom
we
know
is
neither
vulgar
nor
intentional
it
takes
the
form
of
jests
of
questions
if
a
man
sends
flowers
two
or
three
times
but
it
takes
its
worst
and
most
common
form
in
the
sudden
melting
away
of
the
family
if
the
man
calls
and
finds
them
all
together
if
a
man
has
no
specific
intentions
towards
a
girl
and
has
not
determined
in
his
own
mind
that
he
wants
to
marry
her
if
he
is
only
liking
her
a
great
deal
with
but
an
occasional
wonder
in
the
depths
of
his
own
heart
whether
this
girl
is
the
wife
for
him
to
call
upon
her
casually
and
see
the
family
scatter
and
other
callers
hastily
leave
is
enough
to
scare
him
to
death
and
the
girl
herself
has
a
right
to
be
furiously
indignant
when
eligible
young
people
are
in
that
tentative
stage
it
is
death
to
a
love
to
make
them
i
myself
am
so
afraid
of
brushing
the
down
from
the
butterfly
wings
at
this
point
that
occasionally
when
i
have
been
calling
and
the
girl
possible
lover
has
caught
me
before
i
could
escape
in
a
natural
manner
i
have
doggedly
remained
even
knowing
that
perhaps
he
wished
me
well
away
among
the
angels
rather
than
to
run
the
risk
of
making
him
conscious
that
i
understood
his
state
of
mind
imagine
my
feelings
of
anguish
however
at
holding
on
against
my
will
and
against
theirs
wanting
somebody
to
help
me
let
go
much
better
i
solace
myself
afterwards
that
he
should
wish
me
away
than
to
look
after
my
retreating
form
and
wish
in
heaven
name
that
i
had
stayed
better
for
the
girl
i
mean
for
my
own
feelings
but
i
do
not
count
i
am
only
giving
a
girl
one
of
her
rights
in
love
a
few
judicious
obstacles
but
whet
a
man
appetite
if
he
is
worth
having
and
i
do
not
mind
being
a
judicious
obstacle
once
in
a
while
if
i
like
the
girl
as
to
how
far
a
girl
has
a
right
to
encourage
a
man
in
love
opinions
differ
i
once
asked
a
clever
literary
friend
of
mine
whose
husband
is
so
satisfactory
that
it
is
quite
a
delightful
shock
to
discover
it
how
far
men
ought
to
be
encouraged
to
make
love
encourage
them
all
you
can
my
dear
the
best
of
men
require
all
the
encouragement
one
is
capable
of
giving
them
i
pondered
over
that
statement
from
her
point
of
view
it
was
of
course
perfectly
proper
married
men
need
all
the
encouragement
they
can
get
to
keep
them
making
love
to
their
own
wives
but
from
our
standpoint
of
being
girls
and
very
nice
girls
too
some
of
us
if
i
do
say
it
myself
how
far
have
we
a
right
to
encourage
men
to
make
love
to
us
now
i
like
men
and
i
like
girls
so
that
i
never
want
anybody
to
be
hurt
at
this
very
delicate
and
dangerous
game
of
but
somebody
always
getting
hurt
and
although
she
never
makes
any
fuss
about
it
it
is
generally
the
girl
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
one
is
that
love
means
twice
yes
twenty
forty
times
as
much
to
a
girl
as
to
a
man
and
the
second
is
that
we
are
a
believing
set
of
human
geese
and
we
believe
a
great
deal
of
what
you
men
say
which
is
wrong
of
us
and
much
more
of
what
your
pronounced
actions
over
us
imply
which
is
worse
girls
are
just
the
same
along
the
main
lines
of
sentiment
and
hope
and
trust
and
belief
in
men
now
as
they
ever
were
and
most
of
this
talk
about
the
new
woman
being
different
is
mere
stuff
and
nonsense
now
the
men
come
in
right
at
this
point
and
declare
that
we
ought
not
to
believe
so
much
that
until
they
have
actually
proposed
marriage
often
they
themselves
do
not
know
their
own
minds
that
a
man
has
a
perfect
right
to
withdraw
hamlet
if
he
finds
insurmountable
flaws
in
the
girl
nature
or
what
is
oftener
the
case
somebody
whom
he
likes
better
and
they
intimate
pretty
strongly
that
broken
hearts
or
even
slightly
damaged
affections
are
largely
our
own
fault
which
from
their
standpoint
is
true
enough
and
if
we
were
men
we
would
all
say
so
too
but
looking
at
it
from
our
standpoint
does
it
not
seem
as
if
the
men
had
all
the
rights
on
their
side
and
will
they
be
as
generous
in
this
as
they
are
in
everything
else
where
we
are
concerned
and
view
the
matter
from
our
point
of
view
with
the
sidelights
turned
on
in
the
first
place
there
is
practically
the
whole
world
of
women
before
men
from
which
to
choose
think
of
that
thousands
of
women
and
with
the
additional
advantage
of
the
right
to
make
the
first
advances
how
many
do
have
to
choose
from
we
ca
roam
around
the
world
by
ourselves
even
to
all
the
desirable
men
much
less
manage
to
meet
and
study
them
have
to
wait
to
be
approached
even
by
the
meagre
few
which
a
gracious
providence
casts
in
our
way
if
a
girl
receives
three
proposals
that
i
am
told
is
a
fair
average
if
she
receives
ten
she
is
either
an
heiress
or
a
belle
if
she
receives
more
than
ten
she
must
visit
in
the
west
think
now
reasonably
of
the
limited
opportunities
of
the
most
fortunate
of
us
compared
with
the
limitless
opportunities
of
the
least
fortunate
of
you
then
too
in
order
to
make
ourselves
desirable
we
are
not
to
be
forward
or
unduly
prominent
we
are
to
sit
quietly
at
home
and
wait
to
be
asked
we
are
not
to
take
a
man
words
uttered
under
the
magnetism
of
our
presence
for
truth
we
are
not
to
judge
by
his
manner
if
he
does
not
speak
we
are
not
to
flirt
with
any
other
man
when
one
man
is
considering
us
as
a
possible
wife
although
we
know
that
he
is
and
it
is
dangerous
to
guess
because
he
does
not
like
that
it
shows
he
thinks
a
frivolous
nature
or
a
desire
to
attract
or
a
tendency
to
flirt
or
it
is
unwomanly
or
unworthy
a
true
woman
there
are
some
other
things
men
say
to
us
if
several
men
are
attentive
at
the
same
time
but
i
have
forgotten
the
rest
they
are
very
convincing
however
then
when
the
man
has
made
up
his
mind
that
he
wants
us
as
his
wife
that
grammar
sounds
polygamous
but
my
whole
philosophy
of
life
is
against
that
idea
why
we
are
to
be
ready
to
drop
into
his
arms
like
a
ripe
plum
and
not
keep
him
on
of
anxiety
because
only
coquettes
do
that
now
i
am
not
endeavoring
to
do
an
exceptional
man
justice
who
will
resent
that
somewhat
broad
platform
i
am
only
presenting
the
attitude
of
man
in
general
from
a
girl
standpoint
and
if
you
will
view
it
as
referring
to
other
men
and
not
to
yourself
you
will
be
quite
willing
to
admit
that
it
is
in
the
main
true
now
if
in
order
to
avoid
heartaches
and
so
be
able
to
blame
you
for
something
you
never
intended
and
which
you
are
not
willing
to
shoulder
we
are
not
to
let
ourselves
go
when
we
feel
like
falling
in
love
with
you
do
you
give
us
leave
to
allow
every
one
of
you
to
get
clear
up
to
the
and
come
flatly
out
with
the
words
will
you
marry
me
before
we
let
you
know
whether
we
want
you
or
not
or
before
we
begin
to
let
ourselves
go
come
now
own
up
you
men
how
well
do
we
girls
know
you
when
you
have
called
on
us
three
hundred
and
times
in
succession
not
at
all
we
know
only
what
we
can
see
and
hear
how
well
do
we
know
you
when
we
have
been
engaged
to
you
six
months
not
at
all
we
know
only
what
you
have
been
unable
to
conceal
of
your
faults
and
the
virtues
you
have
displayed
in
your
how
long
must
a
woman
be
married
to
a
man
before
she
understands
him
thoroughly
as
thoroughly
as
she
ought
to
have
understood
him
before
she
ever
dared
to
stand
up
at
an
altar
and
promise
to
love
him
and
live
with
him
until
death
did
them
part
a
broken
engagement
ought
to
be
considered
a
blessed
thing
as
a
preventive
of
further
and
worse
ills
but
it
is
not
it
militates
seriously
against
a
girl
not
so
much
with
men
as
with
women
that
is
one
of
the
times
and
there
are
many
others
when
men
are
broader
and
more
just
than
women
the
ordinary
man
taken
at
random
will
say
probably
he
was
a
worthless
fellow
the
ordinary
woman
will
say
she
ought
to
have
known
her
own
mind
better
the
odd
part
of
all
this
is
that
even
if
you
men
as
a
body
should
say
to
all
the
girls
go
ahead
encourage
us
to
the
top
of
your
bent
let
us
propose
without
any
knowledge
based
on
your
past
actions
or
words
as
to
whether
we
are
going
to
be
accepted
or
not
and
we
will
take
the
result
cheerfully
and
wo
rage
or
howl
about
it
that
not
one
of
us
would
do
it
how
conscience
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all
we
might
consider
that
you
were
only
giving
us
our
rights
in
love
we
might
theorize
beautifully
about
it
and
even
vow
we
were
going
to
take
you
at
your
word
and
do
it
but
we
could
it
simply
is
in
us
we
could
not
be
so
unjust
to
you
so
untrue
to
ourselves
the
great
maternal
heart
of
woman
which
bears
the
greater
part
of
all
the
sufferings
in
this
world
that
the
men
and
little
children
may
go
free
prevents
us
from
taking
any
such
rights
from
you
at
the
cost
of
suffering
on
your
part
women
have
tenderer
hearts
than
men
for
a
purpose
and
if
they
are
hurt
oftener
than
men
why
that
is
for
us
to
bear
we
can
not
make
ourselves
over
and
turn
amazons
at
your
expense
men
as
lovers
god
measures
souls
by
their
capacity
for
entertaining
his
best
angel
love
it
is
a
common
fate
a
woman
lot
to
waste
on
one
the
riches
of
her
soul
who
takes
the
wealth
she
gives
him
but
can
not
repay
the
interest
and
much
less
the
whole
are
you
not
kind
ah
yes
so
very
kind
so
thoughtful
of
my
comfort
and
so
true
yes
yes
dear
heart
but
i
not
being
blind
know
that
i
am
not
loved
as
i
love
you
one
tenderer
word
a
little
longer
kiss
would
fill
my
soul
with
music
and
with
song
and
if
you
seem
abstracted
or
i
miss
the
from
your
voice
my
world
goes
wrong
men
seldom
make
perfect
lovers
i
deeply
regret
being
obliged
to
say
this
as
they
are
about
all
we
girls
have
to
depend
upon
in
that
line
but
it
is
the
solemn
truth
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
why
this
is
so
i
suppose
it
is
because
a
man
never
dwells
upon
the
sentimental
side
of
life
nor
understands
the
emotions
unless
he
is
either
a
poet
or
a
miss
nancy
and
it
is
almost
equally
dangerous
to
marry
either
of
those
pray
do
not
be
offended
my
friends
the
poets
at
being
mentioned
in
the
same
paragraph
with
a
miss
nancy
until
you
discover
the
exact
meaning
of
that
effective
term
of
opprobrium
a
miss
nancy
is
a
poet
without
genius
one
who
has
a
talent
for
discovering
the
fineness
of
life
but
who
lacks
the
wit
to
keep
his
views
from
ridicule
it
is
not
a
step
of
the
boots
between
the
sublime
and
the
ridiculous
sometimes
it
is
only
an
invisible
step
of
the
tiniest
i
never
could
understand
why
a
man
who
plays
a
good
game
of
whist
should
not
know
how
to
make
love
there
are
so
many
points
in
common
you
can
play
a
game
of
whist
with
only
enough
skill
to
keep
your
partner
hands
from
your
throat
or
you
can
play
it
for
all
there
is
in
it
now
i
am
not
a
ask
those
who
have
played
with
me
and
see
the
murder
in
their
eyes
as
they
remember
their
wrongs
they
will
tell
you
that
i
can
take
all
the
tricks
not
just
the
odd
but
three
four
and
five
tricks
yet
i
am
not
playing
whist
i
am
just
winning
the
game
that
is
all
if
my
partner
in
an
unthinking
moment
says
let
win
this
game
we
win
it
but
it
is
like
saying
to
the
you
make
that
train
we
make
the
train
and
say
nothing
about
taking
off
a
wheel
or
two
in
the
process
once
after
a
game
of
this
kind
my
partner
said
to
me
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
upon
a
most
brilliant
game
of
cards
now
you
must
not
think
me
either
stupid
or
blundering
i
play
with
magnificent
effrontery
often
rushing
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
but
somehow
effrontery
is
not
the
best
qualification
for
a
i
am
too
lucky
at
holding
the
cards
and
play
each
one
to
win
i
am
lavish
with
trumps
i
delight
to
lead
them
first
hand
round
but
i
have
not
the
courage
of
my
convictions
for
i
always
feel
little
quivers
of
fear
when
i
do
it
because
when
my
trumps
and
aces
are
gone
then
i
gone
too
i
have
no
skill
in
finesse
in
the
subtlety
the
delicate
moves
which
are
the
inherent
qualities
of
a
game
of
whist
to
tell
the
brutal
truth
i
play
my
own
hand
could
anything
be
worse
dear
shade
of
sarah
battle
even
if
i
do
win
in
short
my
manner
of
playing
whist
is
the
way
some
men
most
men
make
love
now
you
know
brothers
i
call
you
brothers
to
prove
how
very
friendly
my
feelings
are
towards
you
even
if
i
do
show
you
up
from
our
side
you
know
that
a
good
is
only
slightly
interested
in
the
play
of
the
great
cards
his
fine
instinct
comes
into
play
when
the
delicate
points
of
the
game
are
in
evidence
when
it
is
a
question
of
who
holds
the
seven
of
clubs
if
he
leads
the
six
in
the
last
hand
or
of
the
of
the
thirteenth
trump
i
never
can
remember
anything
below
the
jack
and
i
give
up
playing
whist
forever
at
least
once
every
month
but
i
am
so
weak
that
i
return
to
it
again
and
again
as
a
smoker
does
to
his
i
feel
partly
vexed
and
partly
sorry
for
myself
when
i
realize
that
i
can
not
play
i
can
only
win
i
have
seen
men
win
very
superior
girls
but
they
have
done
it
in
a
manner
which
would
disgust
a
good
yet
they
too
keep
on
with
their
indifferent
with
the
same
fatal
human
weakness
which
sees
me
brave
the
baleful
light
in
my
partner
eyes
night
after
night
when
i
am
in
a
community
many
men
make
love
because
the
girl
is
convenient
and
they
happen
to
think
about
it
it
never
would
occur
to
me
to
hunt
up
three
people
at
a
and
ask
them
to
play
whist
but
if
three
are
at
a
table
and
there
is
no
one
else
i
drop
into
the
vacant
place
which
could
be
filled
much
better
by
a
skilled
player
with
pathetic
willingness
i
wonder
if
a
man
ever
deliberately
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
and
then
hunted
up
his
ideal
girl
alas
alas
if
he
did
i
never
heard
of
him
but
i
have
seen
scores
of
them
drop
into
vacant
chairs
at
the
girls
sides
and
make
love
just
because
they
were
handy
we
hate
this
handy
we
girls
you
need
think
we
know
it
when
we
hear
it
sometimes
we
are
not
so
stupid
as
we
pretend
but
we
never
let
you
see
that
we
are
clever
enough
to
understand
you
because
you
do
want
us
to
and
i
must
say
that
i
can
not
blame
you
if
we
girls
are
pretending
to
you
that
we
have
been
waiting
all
our
lives
for
just
you
we
dislike
to
have
you
discover
that
we
have
employed
those
years
of
waiting
very
satisfactorily
to
ourselves
so
much
so
that
a
casual
observer
would
not
have
suspected
the
emptiness
of
them
so
your
funny
little
pretences
are
all
very
well
provided
you
do
not
let
us
catch
you
in
them
only
possibly
you
do
not
know
how
many
times
we
do
catch
you
that
is
one
of
the
chief
points
you
never
know
how
many
times
we
see
through
you
and
beyond
and
know
just
why
you
did
certain
things
much
better
than
you
yourselves
know
it
of
course
it
would
not
be
wise
for
us
to
tell
you
this
individually
for
that
would
break
up
the
meeting
but
there
is
no
harm
in
letting
you
know
in
bulk
i
suppose
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
world
who
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
knew
that
we
do
not
consider
men
good
lovers
we
have
accepted
them
and
been
engaged
to
them
and
married
them
and
pretended
to
them
and
what
is
worse
still
pretended
to
ourselves
that
they
were
satisfactory
but
the
truth
is
they
were
not
and
they
are
not
and
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
dared
to
say
so
now
do
expect
if
you
go
to
your
wife
or
your
sweetheart
and
ask
her
if
this
is
so
that
she
is
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
it
i
would
either
i
would
pretend
that
the
others
might
be
unsatisfactory
as
lovers
but
that
you
well
you
just
suited
me
that
all
i
would
have
to
you
understand
to
keep
you
going
and
that
is
what
your
sweetheart
will
do
if
she
did
not
you
would
get
cross
and
sulky
and
there
would
be
a
week
of
unhappiness
for
both
of
you
and
then
the
girl
would
apologize
and
back
down
from
her
position
and
then
you
would
go
on
exactly
as
you
did
before
no
if
you
are
going
to
profit
by
this
at
all
do
not
talk
it
over
with
any
woman
you
love
talk
it
over
with
some
clever
woman
who
will
tell
you
the
truth
because
she
has
nothing
to
lose
a
man
will
always
take
more
from
a
woman
whom
he
does
not
love
than
he
will
from
his
own
sweetheart
or
wife
i
wonder
why
things
are
so
is
it
that
ideal
love
is
only
founded
upon
the
truth
and
the
superstructure
is
built
of
fabrications
is
it
that
we
women
are
much
more
artistic
and
more
clever
at
masquerading
the
truth
that
we
make
so
much
better
lovers
than
the
men
oh
the
scores
and
scores
of
men
who
have
told
me
what
their
wives
thought
of
them
and
then
the
looks
these
wives
have
shot
at
me
across
the
flowers
on
the
only
one
glance
which
no
man
caught
telegraphing
do
i
though
you
are
a
woman
and
you
know
you
know
what
i
would
have
if
i
could
but
how
i
have
had
to
make
him
believe
that
he
was
all
of
that
because
he
is
my
husband
not
that
she
is
dissatisfied
with
him
not
that
she
would
give
him
up
not
that
she
would
leave
him
or
have
anybody
else
if
she
could
she
loves
him
all
she
can
and
he
loves
her
all
he
wants
to
he
has
won
the
game
but
he
has
not
played
for
all
there
was
in
it
i
never
have
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
ideal
love
was
the
best
or
if
love
with
a
great
deal
of
in
it
was
not
the
most
philosophical
and
better
in
the
but
to
those
of
us
who
are
romantic
it
is
fearful
to
think
of
deliberately
turning
our
backs
on
terrapin
and
lobster
and
and
meditating
upon
plain
bread
and
cold
potatoes
you
men
do
not
recognize
the
romantic
streak
which
of
more
or
less
breadth
and
thickness
runs
through
every
woman
making
her
love
good
you
are
so
terribly
practical
and
and
we
girls
like
flowers
and
mental
indigestibles
and
occasional
sundays
we
do
not
know
why
we
do
but
we
do
and
we
can
not
help
it
and
if
you
are
going
to
make
love
according
to
hoyle
you
must
recognize
this
fact
and
pamper
us
in
our
folly
do
we
pamper
you
now
i
know
perfectly
well
how
some
of
you
are
going
to
work
at
it
you
will
begin
by
thinking
yes
that
true
i
got
a
girl
like
that
and
by
jove
i
humor
her
bless
your
dear
hearts
your
intentions
are
always
of
the
best
if
only
you
knew
how
to
carry
them
out
but
the
first
time
you
come
across
a
little
unreasonable
sentimental
folly
of
hers
you
will
take
her
hand
in
yours
and
say
yes
dear
i
understand
just
what
you
mean
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
on
the
subject
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
what
you
want
me
to
but
do
you
see
if
i
do
it
would
look
just
a
little
queer
to
mother
or
the
boys
or
the
other
fellows
or
to
jessie
and
the
girls
or
to
you
may
insert
the
name
for
yourself
and
while
i
want
to
please
you
i
hardly
think
that
is
quite
the
way
to
go
about
it
so
if
you
will
be
the
dear
sensible
little
woman
that
you
always
are
we
will
simply
take
a
nice
little
walk
instead
of
going
to
europe
and
i
will
try
to
make
it
just
as
enjoyable
to
you
you
know
i
shall
be
with
you
darling
and
have
you
often
said
that
you
were
perfectly
happy
wherever
i
was
and
darling
will
begin
a
weak
argument
in
favor
of
her
little
unreasonable
sentimental
whim
represented
by
europe
although
she
sees
that
your
mind
is
made
up
but
you
have
seen
her
weaken
at
your
smooth
talk
and
you
give
her
some
more
and
if
that
does
do
why
you
kiss
her
and
then
gone
and
before
you
leave
her
she
has
assured
you
that
she
really
would
just
as
soon
or
much
rather
take
a
walk
than
go
to
europe
and
you
come
out
whistling
and
thinking
what
a
dear
little
thing
she
is
and
how
much
you
love
her
oh
you
have
won
nobody
denies
that
but
look
at
your
partners
face
if
you
want
to
know
how
you
have
done
it
why
did
you
do
as
you
said
you
were
going
to
why
did
you
do
it
her
way
why
do
you
study
your
sweetheart
and
learn
to
know
her
and
to
know
the
real
woman
the
side
she
never
shows
to
you
nowadays
because
just
as
soon
as
she
sees
your
way
of
doing
she
is
going
to
hunt
up
a
new
way
of
managing
you
it
is
all
your
own
fault
that
you
are
managed
as
you
all
know
you
are
and
your
fault
that
you
get
truth
instead
of
the
pure
white
it
starts
out
pure
white
but
it
is
doctored
before
it
reaches
you
you
never
are
satisfied
to
do
anything
else
in
the
slovenly
way
in
which
you
make
love
i
know
a
man
who
is
just
an
ordinary
man
in
everything
else
but
to
see
him
drive
a
spirited
horse
is
to
know
that
he
has
the
making
of
a
good
lover
in
him
he
is
full
of
enthusiasm
in
studying
his
horse
disposition
he
will
interrupt
the
most
interesting
conversation
to
say
there
pet
that
pile
of
stones
wo
hurt
you
go
on
now
like
the
pretty
little
lady
that
you
are
here
a
nice
bit
of
road
hold
your
head
up
and
just
show
what
you
can
do
that
right
that
my
beauty
see
how
she
reaches
out
she
handsome
quiet
now
pet
take
this
hill
easily
we
know
you
could
keep
up
that
pace
for
an
hour
but
you
must
tire
yourself
all
out
just
because
you
have
a
willing
spirit
see
her
look
around
to
see
if
i
am
pleased
with
her
dear
me
that
nothing
i
said
any
woman
would
do
as
much
if
you
treated
her
that
way
he
is
responsive
so
he
grinned
appreciatively
he
spends
hours
studying
that
horse
traits
he
is
always
saying
that
she
wo
back
or
that
she
hates
this
and
is
afraid
of
that
his
horse
never
has
to
do
anything
that
she
does
want
to
but
his
wife
does
you
men
would
not
do
business
or
even
play
golf
without
many
times
the
thought
you
put
into
your
of
course
now
i
am
not
talking
of
the
sleepless
nights
or
the
anxious
days
you
spent
before
you
knew
whether
she
loved
you
no
indeed
you
did
enough
thinking
and
worrying
then
to
please
anybody
but
i
am
referring
to
the
girl
to
whom
you
are
engaged
perhaps
you
are
married
to
her
and
have
been
for
forty
years
you
are
not
too
old
yet
to
know
that
you
have
not
been
a
perfect
lover
i
know
that
old
story
that
men
are
so
fond
of
telling
just
here
about
a
man
running
for
a
car
before
he
has
caught
it
yes
we
know
all
that
but
we
want
you
to
keep
on
running
however
on
the
other
hand
i
know
that
ideal
love
is
a
difficult
thing
to
manage
from
our
point
of
view
it
is
a
fearful
strain
to
live
up
to
it
in
fact
nobody
can
do
it
but
i
never
could
see
why
you
had
to
stick
to
one
or
the
other
why
ca
you
mix
the
two
ideal
love
is
a
beautiful
thing
to
think
about
or
to
live
in
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
according
to
your
temperament
it
can
not
be
equalled
for
the
first
part
of
an
engagement
or
the
honeymoon
but
it
is
like
going
to
the
theatre
and
seeing
the
grandeur
of
the
old
gray
castle
and
the
perpetual
moonlight
and
the
devoted
love
of
the
satin
duchess
for
the
velvet
duke
you
know
that
it
is
just
acting
and
that
the
villain
is
not
really
going
to
swim
the
moat
with
his
band
of
steel
warriors
and
burn
the
castle
and
capture
the
duchess
and
marry
her
by
force
yet
i
love
to
pretend
i
dearly
love
to
take
two
with
me
and
sop
them
both
and
i
would
like
to
cry
out
loud
only
i
never
do
but
i
always
have
to
pull
my
veil
down
and
feel
my
way
out
of
the
theatre
i
love
to
throw
myself
into
it
and
it
always
annoys
me
when
the
acting
is
so
bad
that
i
can
not
if
any
man
sees
any
moral
in
that
let
him
heed
it
and
believe
that
i
am
only
one
of
ten
thousand
other
girls
who
would
like
to
throw
ourselves
into
the
illusion
of
it
only
your
acting
is
so
bad
that
we
can
not
if
men
would
only
realize
that
the
material
side
is
what
we
girls
care
the
least
for
pray
do
not
think
just
because
you
have
built
us
colonial
houses
and
have
our
clothes
made
for
us
and
never
allow
butchers
bills
to
annoy
us
that
you
have
done
your
whole
duty
by
us
it
never
occurs
to
most
of
us
who
have
those
dear
american
men
for
husbands
and
lovers
that
we
ever
really
could
become
cold
or
hungry
you
would
be
very
unhappy
if
you
thought
anybody
belonging
to
you
did
not
have
all
the
clothes
she
wanted
and
the
best
in
the
market
but
you
think
it
is
a
huge
joke
when
we
say
that
we
are
mentally
cold
and
hungry
a
great
deal
of
the
time
and
that
you
are
a
storehouse
with
all
that
we
need
right
within
your
hearts
and
brains
only
you
will
not
give
it
to
us
when
you
want
to
surprise
us
with
a
present
what
do
you
do
you
buy
us
a
sealskin
or
a
is
what
you
think
we
want
perhaps
some
of
you
have
a
wife
who
only
wants
such
things
and
who
cares
for
nothing
else
so
much
if
so
give
them
to
her
if
her
higher
nature
is
satisfied
with
plush
let
her
have
it
smother
her
in
sealskins
weigh
her
down
to
earth
with
jewels
but
the
rest
of
us
what
are
you
going
to
give
us
as
a
fine
art
if
thou
must
love
me
let
it
be
for
naught
except
for
love
sake
only
do
not
say
love
her
for
her
smile
her
look
her
way
of
speaking
gently
for
a
trick
of
thought
that
falls
in
well
with
mine
and
certes
brought
a
sense
of
pleasant
ease
on
such
a
day
for
these
things
in
themselves
beloved
may
be
changed
or
change
for
thee
and
love
so
wrought
may
be
unwrought
so
neither
love
me
for
thine
own
dear
pity
wiping
my
cheeks
dry
a
creature
might
forget
to
weep
who
bore
thy
comfort
long
and
lose
thy
love
thereby
but
love
me
for
love
sake
that
evermore
thou
mayst
love
on
through
love
eternity
of
course
to
begin
with
every
man
honestly
believes
that
he
has
made
is
making
or
could
make
a
good
lover
so
i
admit
at
the
outset
that
i
am
talking
to
the
lover
who
not
only
is
successful
in
his
own
estimation
but
the
one
who
has
been
encouraged
in
that
belief
by
his
own
sweetheart
or
wife
until
he
has
every
right
to
believe
in
himself
you
are
about
to
be
told
the
honest
truth
for
once
in
your
life
so
much
so
that
your
wives
and
sweethearts
will
tell
me
behind
your
back
that
every
word
of
it
is
true
but
after
you
have
clamored
for
years
to
know
how
women
honestly
felt
on
such
subjects
and
when
nettled
at
not
getting
the
truth
from
us
individually
you
have
declared
that
the
best
of
women
are
naturally
a
little
bit
hypocritical
the
loveliest
part
of
it
all
is
that
you
will
not
believe
a
word
of
what
i
have
said
and
in
accordance
with
that
belief
will
calmly
announce
that
i
do
know
what
i
am
talking
about
well
perhaps
i
do
a
woman
aim
is
never
quite
true
i
could
not
hit
the
but
in
this
case
please
to
remember
that
i
am
firing
at
a
with
i
do
blame
you
for
not
believing
me
it
is
against
your
whole
theory
of
life
not
to
believe
in
yourself
were
a
great
calamity
my
grandfather
was
so
unfortunately
accurate
that
with
advancing
years
he
came
whimsically
to
consider
himself
infallible
and
when
urged
by
the
clamoring
of
his
equally
accurate
family
he
sometimes
consented
to
consult
the
dictionary
and
he
found
that
he
differed
from
it
it
never
disturbed
his
belief
in
himself
he
closed
the
book
saying
placidly
but
the
dictionary
is
wrong
he
considered
such
a
trifle
not
worth
even
getting
heated
about
he
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
a
typical
man
you
see
was
my
grandfather
and
in
consequence
a
great
many
other
people
besides
himself
believed
in
him
but
to
return
know
first
of
all
that
you
can
not
cover
me
with
confusion
by
pointing
to
your
wives
to
prove
that
you
have
been
successful
lovers
i
never
said
you
could
not
get
married
there
is
nothing
intricate
about
that
anybody
can
marry
nor
am
i
to
be
daunted
by
the
fact
that
you
have
been
so
good
a
lover
as
to
make
your
wife
happy
you
may
not
be
considered
a
perfect
lover
even
if
you
have
compassed
that
very
laudable
end
in
fact
the
very
ones
i
mean
are
the
apparently
successful
lovers
with
happy
or
contented
wives
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
your
success
as
lovers
has
ever
crossed
your
dear
old
satisfied
minds
to
you
i
am
alluding
to
the
very
ones
who
never
gave
the
subject
a
thought
before
wake
up
now
and
listen
your
wives
have
thought
about
it
enough
even
if
you
have
not
remember
then
that
i
am
only
trying
to
tell
you
not
men
fail
as
lovers
but
they
fail
in
how
much
you
fail
leave
out
all
flirting
all
precarious
engagements
all
unhappy
carriages
and
presuppose
a
sweet
lovable
woman
contentedly
married
to
a
real
man
a
man
who
truly
loves
even
if
he
has
not
completely
mastered
the
gentle
art
of
no
skeleton
in
the
closet
no
wishing
the
marriage
undone
with
no
eternal
fitnesses
of
things
to
make
the
gods
envious
no
great
joys
of
having
met
each
with
plenty
of
little
rubs
either
in
the
shape
of
hateful
little
economies
in
the
choice
of
and
or
petty
illnesses
and
nerves
just
a
nice
ordinary
pleasant
marriage
with
only
love
to
keep
the
machinery
from
squeaking
and
no
moral
obligation
on
the
man
part
to
see
that
the
supply
of
love
does
not
run
short
a
great
many
men
can
stand
a
squeak
constantly
but
women
have
nerves
and
will
go
to
any
trouble
to
remove
one
which
their
husbands
never
hear
you
have
worked
early
and
late
to
buy
your
wife
even
more
luxuries
than
you
really
could
afford
but
you
love
her
so
much
that
it
was
your
greatest
pleasure
to
heap
good
things
upon
her
and
very
nice
of
you
it
is
you
are
a
dear
good
man
to
do
it
and
i
honor
you
for
it
her
physical
needs
are
abundantly
supplied
indeed
you
are
so
good
a
lover
that
you
remember
your
enough
to
send
her
flowers
on
her
birthdays
and
easter
so
her
sentimental
needs
represented
by
flowers
are
supplied
there
remain
but
two
needs
more
those
of
her
mind
and
heart
it
is
too
delicate
a
subject
to
discuss
whether
you
are
clever
enough
for
her
very
likely
you
are
if
not
she
ought
to
have
attended
to
that
before
she
married
you
because
that
is
one
of
the
few
things
that
you
really
can
know
something
about
during
an
engagement
if
you
are
not
too
much
in
love
to
have
any
sense
left
at
all
therefore
again
i
take
for
granted
that
you
and
she
are
congenial
if
she
is
devotedly
fond
of
music
you
do
not
hate
it
so
that
you
can
not
occasionally
go
with
her
in
the
evening
to
the
opera
with
abundant
props
in
the
shape
of
tickets
for
the
matinée
to
which
you
generously
bid
her
to
take
one
of
the
girls
if
she
loves
books
you
like
to
hear
her
talk
about
them
because
she
does
it
so
well
and
because
she
knows
the
ins
and
outs
of
your
mind
so
thoroughly
that
in
ten
minutes
she
can
give
you
the
plot
and
half
an
hour
reading
aloud
of
striking
passages
will
give
you
so
excellent
an
idea
of
the
style
that
you
can
talk
about
it
more
intelligently
than
some
bachelors
who
have
really
read
it
by
themselves
most
conscientiously
that
is
because
you
are
clever
because
your
wife
is
more
clever
you
have
a
brain
and
your
wife
photographs
her
personality
and
her
subject
upon
it
because
she
understands
you
and
has
studied
you
and
has
a
pride
that
you
shall
appear
to
advantage
among
her
friends
and
not
degenerate
into
a
mere
business
machine
as
too
many
men
do
i
suppose
it
never
occurred
to
you
to
try
to
do
a
similar
thing
for
her
you
could
if
you
wanted
to
but
it
is
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
you
are
generally
tired
but
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
if
you
should
exhibit
the
same
eagerness
that
she
does
to
keep
the
flame
of
love
alive
so
that
your
marriage
should
not
sink
to
the
dead
commonplace
level
of
all
the
other
marriages
you
know
suppose
even
after
you
have
caught
the
car
that
you
occasionally
got
off
and
ran
beside
it
a
while
just
for
healthful
exercise
and
to
keep
yourself
from
growing
ordinary
suppose
occasionally
hunted
out
a
new
book
and
marked
it
and
brought
it
home
to
read
to
her
not
because
you
think
she
have
got
it
without
you
but
just
to
show
her
that
you
are
trying
to
pull
evenly
and
that
you
wanted
to
do
something
extra
charming
for
her
her
and
to
prove
that
you
have
a
conscience
about
keeping
this
precious
evanescent
but
carelessly
treated
love
at
a
point
where
it
is
still
a
joy
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
get
so
used
to
a
beautiful
exception
like
love
that
you
never
think
of
it
as
marvellous
a
man
never
seems
to
be
able
to
understand
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
supremest
pleasure
from
an
act
of
thoughtfulness
to
his
wife
he
must
be
wholly
unselfish
and
give
it
to
her
in
her
line
and
the
way
she
wants
it
and
the
way
he
knows
she
wants
it
if
he
would
only
stop
to
think
i
know
a
man
who
hates
to
go
out
in
the
evening
but
who
occasionally
in
order
to
do
something
particularly
sweet
and
unselfish
to
please
his
wife
takes
her
to
the
theatre
she
loves
fine
plays
tragedy
comedy
but
he
takes
her
to
the
minstrels
because
that
is
the
only
thing
he
can
stand
and
for
two
weeks
afterwards
he
keeps
saying
to
her
did
i
take
you
to
the
theatre
the
other
night
honey
do
i
sometimes
sacrifice
myself
for
your
pleasure
and
she
goes
and
kisses
him
and
says
yes
and
tries
not
to
think
that
his
selfishness
more
than
outweighs
his
unselfishness
women
have
more
conscience
about
deceiving
themselves
into
staying
in
love
than
men
have
but
even
yet
suppose
you
are
not
that
kind
of
a
man
we
have
not
got
to
the
point
of
the
subject
yet
our
way
lies
through
the
head
to
the
heart
and
the
man
who
is
scrupulously
careful
about
acts
has
yet
to
watch
at
once
the
greatest
joy
the
greatest
grief
the
supremest
healing
of
even
deliberate
wounds
words
it
is
a
question
with
me
whether
a
woman
ever
knows
all
the
joys
of
who
has
one
of
those
dumb
silent
husbands
who
doubtless
adores
her
but
is
unable
to
express
it
only
in
deeds
it
requires
an
act
of
the
will
to
remember
that
his
getting
at
seven
every
morning
is
all
done
for
you
when
he
has
not
been
able
to
tell
you
in
words
that
he
loves
you
it
is
hard
to
keep
thinking
that
he
looked
at
you
last
night
as
if
he
thought
you
were
pretty
when
he
did
not
say
so
it
is
hard
to
receive
a
telegram
when
you
are
looking
for
a
letter
saying
have
not
had
time
to
write
shall
be
home
sunday
will
bring
you
something
nice
it
is
harder
still
to
get
a
letter
telling
about
the
weather
how
busy
he
is
when
the
same
amount
of
space
saying
that
he
got
to
thinking
about
you
yesterday
when
he
saw
a
girl
on
the
street
who
looked
like
you
only
she
did
carry
herself
so
well
as
you
do
and
that
he
was
a
lucky
man
to
have
got
you
when
so
many
other
men
wanted
you
and
he
loved
you
would
have
fairly
made
your
heart
turn
over
with
joy
and
made
you
kiss
the
hurried
lines
and
thrust
the
letter
in
your
belt
where
you
could
crackle
it
now
and
then
just
to
make
sure
it
was
there
nearly
all
nice
men
make
good
lovers
in
deeds
many
fail
in
the
handling
of
words
few
indeed
combine
the
two
and
make
perfect
lovers
but
the
last
test
of
all
and
to
my
mind
the
greatest
is
in
the
use
of
words
as
a
balm
few
people
be
they
men
or
women
be
they
lovers
married
or
only
friends
can
help
occasionally
hurting
each
feelings
accidents
are
continually
happening
even
when
people
are
and
for
quick
or
ones
there
is
but
one
remedy
the
handsome
honest
apology
the
most
perfect
lover
is
the
one
who
best
understands
how
and
when
to
apologize
i
have
heard
men
say
to
prove
their
independence
their
proud
spirit
their
unbending
i
never
apologize
they
say
it
in
such
conscious
pride
and
so
honestly
expect
me
to
admire
them
and
i
am
so
amiable
that
i
never
dare
remonstrate
i
simply
keep
out
of
their
way
but
i
feel
like
saying
poor
pitiful
soul
poor
meagre
nature
not
to
know
the
gladness
of
restoring
a
smile
to
a
face
from
which
you
have
driven
it
only
to
know
the
coldness
of
a
misnamed
pride
never
to
know
the
close
warm
joy
of
humility
many
people
know
nothing
about
a
real
apology
a
lukewarm
apology
is
more
insulting
than
the
insult
a
handsome
apology
is
the
handsomest
thing
in
the
world
and
the
manliest
and
the
womanliest
an
apology
like
chivalry
is
sexless
perhaps
because
it
is
a
natural
virtue
of
women
it
sits
manlier
upon
men
than
upon
women
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
even
as
chivalry
being
a
natural
attribute
of
men
becomes
beautiful
beyond
words
to
express
when
found
in
women
i
have
often
heard
men
say
they
never
apologize
sometimes
i
have
heard
women
pitiful
indeed
it
becomes
then
a
woman
without
religion
is
no
more
repulsive
to
me
than
one
who
never
apologizes
how
i
pity
the
people
who
love
those
men
and
women
who
never
apologize
a
delicate
apology
brings
into
play
all
the
virtues
necessary
to
a
perfect
humanity
the
proudest
are
generally
those
who
can
bend
the
lowest
it
is
not
pride
it
is
a
stupid
vanity
and
an
abnormal
which
prevent
a
man
or
woman
from
apologizing
an
apology
requires
a
native
humility
of
which
only
great
souls
are
capable
it
requires
generosity
to
be
willing
to
humble
yourself
it
takes
faith
in
humanity
to
think
that
your
apology
will
be
accepted
you
must
have
a
sense
of
justice
to
believe
that
you
owe
it
it
requires
sincerity
to
make
it
sound
honest
and
tact
to
do
it
at
the
right
time
it
requires
patience
to
stick
to
it
until
the
wound
has
ceased
to
bleed
and
the
best
highest
truest
type
of
love
to
make
you
want
to
do
it
there
is
only
one
thing
meaner
than
a
person
who
never
apologizes
and
that
is
a
person
who
will
not
accept
one
it
requires
a
finer
type
of
generosity
to
receive
generously
than
to
give
generously
and
a
nature
is
more
divine
which
can
forgive
honestly
and
quickly
than
one
which
can
only
apologize
and
is
not
capable
of
a
swift
forgiveness
but
it
is
a
wise
dispensation
of
providence
that
the
two
are
twin
virtues
and
are
generally
to
be
met
with
in
the
same
broad
and
beautiful
nature
used
against
a
high
soul
there
is
no
surer
method
of
humiliation
than
an
apology
in
one
skilled
at
reading
human
nature
an
apology
becomes
a
weapon
when
you
are
not
the
one
who
should
apologize
first
when
you
are
less
to
blame
than
he
be
you
the
one
to
apologize
first
and
see
how
quickly
his
noble
nature
will
abase
itself
and
rush
to
meet
you
and
how
sure
and
glorious
and
complete
the
reconciliation
will
be
i
never
can
blame
people
who
refuse
to
accept
an
apology
in
the
shape
of
flowers
when
the
wound
has
been
given
in
words
the
whole
of
europe
would
not
compensate
some
women
for
a
hurt
when
the
hurt
had
been
distinctly
worded
and
the
apology
came
in
the
shape
of
a
dumb
voiceless
present
from
the
standpoint
of
observation
and
inexperience
i
would
say
that
the
supremest
lack
of
men
as
lovers
is
the
inability
to
say
i
am
sorry
dear
forgive
me
and
to
keep
on
saying
it
until
the
hurt
is
entirely
gone
you
gave
her
the
deep
wound
be
manly
enough
to
stay
by
it
until
it
has
healed
men
will
go
to
any
trouble
any
expense
any
personal
inconvenience
to
heal
it
without
the
simple
use
of
those
simple
words
a
man
thinks
if
a
woman
begins
to
smile
at
him
again
after
a
hurt
for
which
he
has
not
yet
apologized
has
commenced
to
grow
dull
that
the
worst
is
over
and
that
if
he
keeps
away
from
the
dangerous
subject
he
has
done
his
duty
besides
has
he
given
her
a
piano
to
pay
for
it
but
that
same
man
would
call
another
man
a
brute
who
insisted
upon
healing
up
a
finger
with
the
splinter
still
in
it
so
that
an
accidental
pressure
would
always
cause
pain
if
you
do
not
believe
this
what
do
you
suppose
the
result
would
be
if
you
should
apologize
to
your
wife
for
something
you
said
last
year
if
you
think
she
has
forgotten
because
she
never
speaks
of
it
just
try
it
once
i
honestly
believe
that
the
simple
phrase
i
am
sorry
dear
forgive
me
has
done
more
to
hold
brothers
in
the
home
to
endear
sisters
to
each
other
to
comfort
mothers
and
fathers
to
tie
friends
together
to
placate
lovers
that
more
marriages
have
taken
place
because
of
them
and
more
have
held
together
on
account
of
them
that
more
love
of
all
kinds
has
been
engendered
by
them
than
by
any
other
words
in
the
english
language
girls
and
other
girls
thou
art
so
very
sweet
and
fair
with
such
a
heaven
in
thine
eyes
it
almost
seems
an
to
ask
thee
to
be
good
or
wise
as
if
a
little
bird
were
blamed
because
its
song
unthinking
flows
as
if
a
rose
should
be
ashamed
of
being
nothing
but
a
rose
it
is
so
hard
for
shrewdness
to
admit
folly
means
no
harm
when
she
calls
black
white
people
who
criticise
the
grammar
of
those
young
girls
who
say
i
think
should
have
a
care
for
it
is
more
true
than
incorrect
most
girls
do
think
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
girls
girls
under
and
others
of
course
although
you
may
not
know
it
age
has
no
more
to
do
with
that
statement
than
it
had
to
do
with
the
one
when
i
hinted
that
man
reached
the
ripe
state
of
perfection
at
the
mystic
age
of
these
are
but
approximate
figures
and
are
only
for
use
in
general
practice
they
have
no
bearing
on
specific
cases
when
it
is
always
best
to
call
in
a
specialist
i
know
many
girls
who
are
still
seeing
and
hearing
unintelligently
and
have
not
begun
to
assimilate
knowledge
even
at
i
know
others
of
twenty
who
have
assimilated
so
well
that
they
will
never
be
under
but
it
is
a
literal
fact
and
this
statement
i
am
willing
to
live
up
to
that
the
majority
of
girls
must
have
lived
through
their
first
youth
before
a
thinking
person
can
take
any
comfort
with
them
i
am
sure
samuel
johnson
had
this
in
mind
when
he
said
is
a
terrible
thing
that
we
can
not
wish
young
ladies
well
without
wishing
them
to
become
old
women
or
possibly
the
exclamation
was
wrung
from
him
after
an
attempt
to
talk
to
one
of
them
many
brave
men
who
would
stop
a
runaway
horse
or
who
would
dare
to
look
for
burglars
under
the
bed
quail
utterly
before
the
prospect
of
talking
to
a
young
girl
who
frankly
says
i
do
think
how
can
those
girls
who
give
evidence
of
no
more
thought
than
is
evinced
by
their
chatter
call
their
existence
living
they
mistake
pertness
for
wit
audacity
for
cleverness
disrespect
to
old
age
for
independence
and
general
bad
manners
for
individuality
has
nobody
ever
trained
these
girls
to
think
what
kind
of
schools
do
they
attend
who
has
spoiled
them
by
flattery
until
they
are
little
peacocks
to
whom
a
mirror
is
an
irresistible
temptation
why
do
unthinking
parents
supply
them
with
money
and
never
ask
how
they
spend
it
how
does
it
come
that
if
you
want
to
find
great
numbers
of
them
together
you
go
to
huyler
instead
of
to
brentano
what
kind
of
women
will
these
girls
make
to
whom
a
wrinkle
in
their
waist
is
of
more
moment
than
their
soul
salvation
i
often
wonder
what
kind
of
mothers
these
girls
have
surely
there
can
be
no
family
conversation
where
they
live
surely
they
never
hear
the
great
questions
of
the
day
discussed
at
the
from
the
number
of
hours
they
spend
upon
the
street
i
often
am
tempted
to
say
what
the
poor
tired
woman
who
stood
for
miles
in
the
said
to
her
have
none
of
yez
poor
little
creatures
poor
lovely
little
who
occasionally
organize
a
concert
for
newsboys
whose
lives
are
busier
and
more
useful
than
their
own
a
street
waifs
benefit
for
street
waifs
if
the
crude
young
person
who
stands
with
such
eager
feet
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
that
she
has
wetted
her
pretty
shoon
in
her
haste
to
be
in
the
society
of
men
could
only
have
the
wit
to
sing
o
wad
some
power
the
giftie
gie
us
to
see
oursels
as
others
see
us
she
might
discover
strange
points
of
resemblance
between
herself
and
a
very
young
baby
in
the
earliest
days
of
earthly
existence
a
baby
is
in
a
state
from
which
no
one
can
say
what
he
will
emerge
his
brain
is
a
sponge
he
receives
everything
and
gives
nothing
he
is
pretty
to
look
at
and
seems
made
for
nothing
but
love
he
coos
and
gurgles
he
seldom
does
anything
more
intelligent
than
to
smile
and
he
prefers
men
to
women
the
greatest
fault
that
thinking
men
find
with
this
sort
of
girl
is
that
she
becomes
sillier
every
day
that
she
lives
i
have
heard
women
complain
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
boys
who
seek
their
daughters
in
marriage
but
when
i
look
at
the
many
girls
of
this
type
i
am
tempted
to
say
well
madam
who
but
a
degenerate
would
care
to
marry
your
daughter
men
claim
that
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
their
ideals
in
regard
to
women
in
the
face
of
such
selfishness
crudeness
bad
manners
and
jealousies
as
exist
between
young
girls
of
this
sort
of
course
they
who
have
become
belles
by
reason
of
their
lovely
faces
never
know
that
the
thinking
class
of
young
men
criticise
them
adversely
and
they
would
not
care
if
they
did
there
are
still
many
men
who
do
admire
and
who
will
fall
in
love
with
them
and
the
others
are
not
missed
we
must
not
blame
them
too
severely
for
rejoicing
in
their
loveliness
it
might
be
a
hard
struggle
for
the
rest
of
us
not
to
do
the
same
if
we
had
their
beauty
men
often
wonder
why
girls
friendships
are
so
hollow
they
wonder
why
we
are
so
ungenerous
to
each
other
so
hateful
call
it
hateful
is
not
a
man
word
it
is
a
woman
and
trust
a
woman
to
know
exactly
what
it
means
well
the
truth
of
it
is
that
men
are
at
the
bottom
of
a
great
deal
of
it
girls
seldom
quarrel
with
each
other
except
over
some
man
and
while
they
intend
to
be
loyal
to
each
other
they
can
not
seem
to
manage
it
if
there
is
a
man
in
the
case
most
girls
have
two
natures
one
she
shows
to
men
the
other
to
other
girls
what
we
know
of
one
is
the
way
she
droops
and
is
so
openly
bored
by
other
girls
that
it
is
quite
a
blow
to
our
vanity
to
be
obliged
to
be
with
her
we
recognize
the
other
at
the
approach
of
a
man
even
if
we
can
not
see
him
by
the
changes
in
the
girl
face
she
straightens
herself
puts
a
hand
on
each
side
of
her
waist
and
pushes
her
belt
down
lower
moistens
her
lips
a
sparkle
comes
into
her
eyes
she
touches
her
back
hair
and
runs
a
finger
under
the
edge
of
her
veil
then
she
smiles
such
a
smile
as
the
other
girls
have
not
been
able
to
win
from
her
in
three
hours
these
girls
are
very
clever
sometimes
even
these
little
soft
kitteny
girls
who
do
not
know
anything
about
books
who
never
read
who
never
study
and
are
popularly
called
even
by
the
very
men
who
make
love
to
them
these
girls
are
keen
beyond
words
to
express
in
their
intuitive
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
the
differentiation
between
man
nature
and
woman
nature
they
are
capable
of
using
the
outward
and
apparent
motives
of
humanity
for
an
effect
and
secretly
of
plying
the
subtlest
and
most
occult
it
is
difficult
to
designate
their
exact
methods
and
dangerous
to
exploit
them
for
you
immediately
lay
yourself
open
to
the
suspicion
of
being
capable
of
the
same
yourself
or
of
its
being
beneath
your
dignity
to
accuse
any
one
of
such
duplicity
and
yet
there
are
the
causes
and
there
are
the
results
you
can
shut
your
eyes
to
them
if
you
wish
it
is
just
here
where
a
girl
of
this
kind
is
so
uncanny
of
course
for
those
of
us
who
wish
to
take
a
lofty
view
of
love
and
lovers
who
wish
to
think
each
woman
sought
out
by
a
man
for
her
beauty
and
virtues
and
married
for
love
it
is
very
repugnant
to
have
to
face
the
fact
that
there
are
hundreds
of
sweet
nice
girls
of
good
family
and
good
training
who
regard
the
securing
for
themselves
of
another
girl
lover
a
perfectly
legitimate
operation
not
infrequently
one
hears
it
said
that
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
girls
in
town
because
she
can
cut
any
girl
out
that
she
tries
to
you
may
say
that
a
man
so
easily
won
is
no
great
loss
or
that
such
things
may
occur
in
other
circles
of
society
but
not
in
yours
possibly
they
do
not
one
does
not
deny
the
honor
of
honorable
men
and
women
in
any
walk
in
life
but
in
polite
society
fashionable
society
these
things
occur
oftener
in
new
york
than
in
boston
and
oftener
in
london
and
paris
than
in
new
york
indeed
we
may
sneer
as
we
often
do
at
the
primitive
customs
of
the
lowly
and
at
their
absurd
phrase
of
keeping
company
it
makes
a
delightful
jest
but
beneath
it
is
a
greater
regard
for
the
rights
of
a
man
or
woman
in
love
than
one
is
apt
to
find
higher
in
the
social
scale
with
them
to
select
one
another
to
keep
company
is
like
an
offer
of
marriage
to
keep
steady
company
is
the
formal
announcement
of
an
engagement
which
is
a
potential
marriage
it
is
the
first
step
towards
matrimony
and
is
almost
as
sacred
and
final
with
their
more
fortunate
and
envied
sisters
in
the
smart
set
an
engagement
is
the
loosest
kind
of
a
bond
and
neither
man
nor
woman
is
safe
from
the
wooing
of
other
men
and
women
until
the
marriage
vows
have
been
pronounced
and
if
your
society
is
very
fashionable
not
even
then
so
that
this
society
of
which
i
speak
would
undeniably
be
called
good
now
of
course
all
women
desire
to
be
loved
she
is
a
very
queer
woman
who
would
deny
that
proposition
if
asked
by
the
right
person
and
i
hope
he
would
have
sense
enough
not
to
believe
her
if
she
did
i
do
not
object
to
a
girl
making
herself
attractive
to
men
in
a
modest
and
maidenly
way
on
the
contrary
i
heartily
approve
of
it
but
i
would
have
her
select
a
man
who
belonged
to
no
other
girl
and
to
know
that
nothing
but
misery
can
result
from
the
taking
of
a
lover
away
from
her
friend
it
is
the
fashion
for
women
to
deny
that
this
is
done
i
never
could
see
why
but
possibly
they
deny
it
because
they
are
afraid
if
they
discuss
it
that
people
will
think
some
girl
has
lured
a
lover
or
two
away
from
people
who
have
witnessed
the
outward
results
of
this
phenomenon
also
deny
the
true
cause
on
the
ground
that
the
robber
girl
was
not
clever
enough
to
have
done
it
that
she
simply
was
more
to
the
man
taste
than
the
first
girl
and
so
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
man
of
course
i
can
not
deny
the
fickleness
of
man
but
i
do
say
that
the
girl
hardly
lives
no
matter
how
pretty
she
is
who
has
not
the
wit
to
get
another
girl
lover
if
she
wants
him
it
makes
no
difference
how
young
she
is
she
never
makes
the
mistake
of
disparaging
the
first
girl
no
woman
of
the
world
is
less
liable
to
such
an
error
than
a
girl
who
deliberately
intends
to
get
another
girl
lover
she
begins
by
gaining
her
confidence
very
likely
she
manages
to
stay
all
night
with
her
that
is
the
time
when
you
tell
everything
you
know
just
because
it
is
dark
and
then
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
wishing
you
had
then
when
she
has
the
points
of
the
compass
so
to
speak
she
says
she
will
help
her
dear
friend
and
the
dear
friend
not
being
clever
or
she
would
have
confided
thinks
she
is
the
loveliest
girl
in
the
world
and
after
promising
to
send
her
lover
to
call
in
order
to
be
helped
she
calmly
goes
to
sleep
just
as
if
she
has
not
seen
the
beginning
of
the
end
the
other
girl
has
observed
and
she
is
of
course
pretty
and
attractive
girls
who
do
not
know
anything
and
who
never
study
are
always
pretty
it
is
only
the
plain
girl
who
is
obliged
to
be
clever
the
first
time
she
sees
the
lover
of
her
dear
friend
she
begins
to
laud
her
to
the
sky
she
herself
is
looking
so
pretty
and
she
shows
off
in
the
most
favorable
light
while
all
the
time
singing
her
dear
friend
praise
with
such
fatal
persistency
that
she
fairly
makes
him
sick
of
the
sound
of
her
name
and
of
her
virtues
now
the
man
would
hardly
be
human
if
he
did
not
tell
this
artless
little
creature
that
he
had
had
enough
of
her
dear
friend
and
that
he
would
much
prefer
to
talk
about
herself
pouts
of
hurt
surprise
she
thought
you
were
such
a
friend
of
hers
she
only
wanted
to
entertain
you
by
the
only
subject
she
thought
would
interest
you
presto
the
entering
wedge
she
knows
it
but
the
man
does
not
he
has
no
idea
of
being
disloyal
to
his
sweetheart
but
he
is
a
lost
man
nevertheless
lost
to
the
first
girl
and
won
by
the
second
won
in
a
perfectly
harmless
and
legitimate
way
too
won
while
doing
her
duty
keeping
her
promise
helping
her
friend
her
conscience
acquits
her
she
has
only
observed
and
made
use
of
her
cleverness
to
know
that
too
smooth
and
easy
a
course
to
true
love
generally
gives
him
to
the
other
girl
but
in
reality
she
has
stolen
him
she
has
committed
a
real
theft
and
personally
i
should
prefer
to
know
her
had
she
stolen
money
you
can
jail
a
man
who
steals
your
watch
but
the
girl
who
steals
a
heart
away
from
his
sweetheart
walks
free
and
uncondemned
even
to
their
shame
be
it
spoken
by
those
who
know
what
she
has
done
nobody
dares
condemn
her
even
the
friends
of
the
robbed
girl
for
that
presupposes
some
lack
in
her
charm
and
gives
publicity
to
her
loss
the
wronged
girl
because
of
her
pride
and
conventionality
and
civilization
makes
no
outcry
a
barbarian
in
her
place
would
have
fallen
on
the
robber
girl
in
a
fury
and
scratched
her
eyes
out
sometimes
i
am
sorry
that
our
barbaric
days
are
over
some
of
the
greatest
tragedies
in
life
have
come
from
this
disloyalty
among
girls
in
their
relations
with
each
other
i
have
no
patience
with
those
people
who
fall
in
love
with
forbidden
property
and
give
as
their
excuse
i
could
help
it
such
culpable
weakness
is
more
dangerous
to
society
than
real
wickedness
love
is
not
a
matter
of
infatuation
it
is
not
the
temptation
which
is
wrong
it
is
the
deliberate
following
it
up
simply
because
the
temptation
is
agreeable
of
course
it
is
agreeable
you
are
not
often
irresistibly
tempted
to
go
and
have
your
teeth
filled
men
never
will
have
done
with
their
strictures
on
girls
until
girls
achieve
two
things
one
is
to
observe
more
honor
in
their
relations
with
each
other
and
the
other
is
to
learn
to
think
on
the
subject
of
husbands
all
that
i
am
my
mother
made
me
perhaps
you
think
that
girls
do
not
know
enough
about
other
husbands
to
discuss
them
with
any
profit
but
if
there
has
been
a
dinner
or
theatre
party
within
our
memory
where
the
married
girls
did
not
take
the
bachelors
and
leave
their
husbands
for
us
we
would
just
like
to
know
when
it
was
that
all
i
dare
say
it
never
occurred
to
these
wives
what
an
opportunity
this
custom
gives
us
to
study
social
problems
at
close
range
we
girls
are
supposed
to
be
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
but
we
are
none
of
the
three
we
try
to
see
all
there
is
to
see
and
hear
all
there
is
to
hear
and
then
when
we
get
together
we
would
be
human
if
we
did
talk
it
over
and
tell
each
other
how
infinitely
better
could
manage
jessie
husband
than
she
does
and
that
it
seems
a
pity
that
carrie
does
understand
george
i
suppose
it
would
be
rather
handsome
of
us
always
to
pretend
that
we
did
not
hear
the
covert
rebuke
or
the
open
sarcasm
bandied
about
between
these
husbands
and
wives
on
the
whole
i
think
it
be
chivalrous
for
us
to
be
utterly
oblivious
and
talk
about
the
weather
if
anybody
asked
us
if
we
knew
that
mary
never
could
spend
a
cent
without
having
john
ask
her
what
she
did
with
it
that
is
the
way
men
do
when
they
do
not
wish
to
tell
on
each
other
i
think
men
are
fine
in
that
way
we
girls
all
think
so
only
we
seldom
have
the
moral
courage
to
emulate
their
admirable
example
we
are
so
fond
of
talking
things
over
and
if
the
married
women
do
not
wish
us
to
talk
their
husbands
over
just
let
them
give
us
our
own
rightful
property
the
bachelors
and
we
will
never
utter
another
cheep
however
i
would
not
give
up
my
small
experience
with
other
husbands
for
a
great
deal
it
has
convinced
me
of
something
of
which
i
always
have
been
reasonably
sure
and
that
is
that
american
men
make
the
best
husbands
in
the
world
and
that
women
who
can
not
get
along
with
americans
and
who
think
men
of
another
race
who
have
more
polish
more
finesse
more
veneer
would
suit
them
better
could
not
manage
to
live
happily
with
the
angel
gabriel
dear
me
if
these
dissatisfied
american
wives
could
only
realize
that
an
providence
had
in
the
american
man
given
us
the
best
article
in
the
market
and
that
when
we
rebel
at
our
lot
we
are
simply
proving
that
we
do
not
deserve
our
good
fortune
they
would
never
even
discuss
the
subject
of
having
men
of
any
other
nationality
of
course
in
every
nation
there
is
a
class
of
men
who
are
as
noble
as
as
chivalrous
as
even
the
most
captious
american
girl
could
wish
but
i
refer
to
the
general
run
of
men
when
i
say
that
there
is
something
about
men
born
outside
of
america
a
native
selfishness
or
callousness
a
lack
of
perception
and
appreciation
of
the
fineness
of
womanhood
amounting
to
a
sort
of
mental
brutality
which
wellnigh
unfits
them
for
close
social
contact
with
the
american
woman
and
just
as
surely
as
american
women
persist
in
disregarding
this
subtle
yet
unmistakable
truth
just
so
surely
will
they
lay
themselves
open
to
these
from
foreign
husbands
which
american
men
as
a
race
are
incapable
of
inflicting
i
say
they
are
incapable
of
inflicting
them
because
american
men
in
the
face
of
everything
said
and
written
to
the
contrary
are
in
regard
to
women
the
race
of
men
in
the
world
now
in
this
generalizing
i
beg
that
you
will
not
accuse
me
of
asserting
that
these
strictures
are
true
of
every
man
who
is
not
an
american
or
that
all
american
men
are
perfect
but
i
do
wish
to
state
clearly
and
frankly
my
admiration
for
american
men
as
a
race
when
an
american
man
a
gentleman
he
is
to
my
mind
the
most
perfect
gentleman
that
any
race
can
produce
because
good
manners
spring
from
his
heart
and
there
are
a
few
of
us
enough
to
plead
that
politeness
should
go
deeper
than
the
skin
now
if
the
assertion
is
made
that
the
american
man
makes
the
best
husband
in
the
world
let
him
not
think
that
there
is
no
room
for
improvement
for
with
him
it
is
much
the
same
as
it
is
with
the
wild
strawberry
at
first
blush
one
would
say
that
there
could
be
no
more
delicious
flavor
than
that
of
the
wild
strawberry
yet
everybody
knows
what
the
skilled
gardeners
have
made
of
it
in
the
form
of
the
cultivated
fruit
nevertheless
the
crude
article
found
growing
wild
upon
its
native
heath
is
much
to
be
preferred
to
the
candied
ginger
of
other
nations
after
admitting
that
the
wild
strawberry
is
capable
of
cultivation
and
even
attaining
under
skilful
care
the
highest
type
of
perfection
let
no
one
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
time
for
such
improvement
is
after
they
have
been
grown
and
placed
upon
the
market
if
they
are
found
to
be
knotty
half
green
or
in
a
state
of
decadence
and
you
are
bound
to
buy
strawberries
you
can
take
them
and
by
your
native
woman
wit
you
can
dress
them
into
a
state
of
palatableness
even
if
you
have
to
reduce
them
to
a
pulp
in
the
sacred
mysteries
of
a
but
in
order
to
take
all
the
comfort
which
strawberries
are
capable
of
giving
to
mankind
they
should
be
perfect
in
themselves
when
they
come
from
the
hand
of
the
gardener
just
as
it
was
his
mother
duty
to
have
trained
that
husband
of
yours
before
he
came
under
your
influence
it
really
is
asking
too
much
of
a
woman
to
expect
her
to
bring
up
a
husband
and
her
children
too
she
vainly
imagines
when
she
marries
this
piece
of
perfection
with
whom
she
is
so
blindly
in
love
that
he
is
already
trained
or
rather
that
he
is
the
one
human
being
in
the
world
who
has
been
perfect
from
infancy
and
who
never
needed
training
she
never
dreams
of
the
curious
fact
that
mothers
always
train
their
daughters
to
make
good
wives
yet
rarely
ever
think
of
training
their
boys
to
make
good
husbands
therefore
unless
like
topsy
they
have
just
growed
good
and
kind
and
considerate
a
woman
has
a
before
her
in
training
her
own
husband
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
while
we
girls
receive
specific
training
to
the
express
end
of
making
good
wives
the
boys
of
the
family
receive
only
general
training
of
chivalry
and
courtesy
towards
all
women
not
with
a
view
of
having
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
with
one
woman
or
the
tact
with
which
this
one
woman
must
be
treated
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
somebody
should
open
a
select
kindergarten
for
embryo
husbands
yet
we
girls
have
been
in
a
similar
institution
for
embryo
wives
since
childhood
we
are
told
in
our
early
teens
well
only
your
mother
would
bear
that
no
husband
would
or
you
will
have
to
be
more
gentle
and
unselfish
with
your
brother
if
you
want
to
make
some
man
a
good
wife
a
good
wife
it
has
a
magic
sound
of
course
every
girl
expects
to
marry
and
the
shadowy
idea
of
making
a
wife
to
this
mysterious
but
delightfully
interesting
personage
who
is
growing
up
somewhere
in
the
world
and
waiting
for
her
even
as
she
is
waiting
for
him
makes
the
hard
task
of
easier
for
we
all
wish
to
make
a
wife
nor
are
we
taught
alone
to
be
gentle
and
sweet
and
faithful
we
girls
have
to
learn
that
factor
in
a
happy
life
tact
we
are
early
taught
that
it
is
not
enough
to
master
the
fundamental
principles
which
govern
the
genus
man
we
have
to
discover
that
each
man
must
be
treated
differently
we
must
cater
to
individual
tastes
we
must
learn
individual
needs
and
fill
them
in
short
we
are
taught
to
observe
men
to
study
them
and
then
to
hold
ourselves
accordingly
pray
do
not
imagine
that
all
this
is
put
into
words
or
that
we
have
certain
hours
for
studying
how
to
make
good
wives
or
that
it
is
as
rigid
or
exhausting
as
a
broom
drill
it
is
the
intangible
esoteric
philosophy
which
permeates
the
households
of
thousands
of
american
families
where
the
mothers
are
the
companions
and
confidantes
of
the
daughters
it
is
an
understood
thing
you
would
be
surprised
to
know
how
young
some
girls
are
when
they
have
thoroughly
mastered
this
wonderful
tact
with
men
and
what
is
it
that
makes
the
american
girl
so
dangerous
for
all
the
other
women
in
the
world
to
compete
with
it
is
because
she
studies
her
man
and
how
did
she
learn
it
by
seeing
her
mother
manage
her
father
or
perhaps
by
seeing
how
easily
her
father
could
be
managed
if
her
mother
only
understood
him
better
there
is
a
good
deal
of
progressive
thought
among
girls
in
this
generation
why
in
the
world
mothers
train
their
girls
and
boys
alike
up
to
a
certain
point
in
general
courtesy
and
consideration
for
each
other
and
then
go
on
with
the
girls
teaching
them
the
gentle
faithful
finesse
which
every
wife
has
to
understand
yet
leaves
her
boy
to
gang
his
ain
gait
just
at
the
formative
period
of
his
life
i
am
not
able
to
say
if
i
could
only
hear
some
mother
say
to
her
son
do
let
your
squeak
so
try
not
to
make
distracting
noises
you
may
have
a
nervous
wife
and
you
might
just
as
well
learn
to
be
quiet
there
is
no
sense
in
thinking
just
because
you
are
a
boy
that
you
can
make
unnecessary
and
superfluous
noises
i
think
i
should
die
of
joy
or
how
would
it
sound
to
hear
her
say
whenever
you
come
in
and
find
your
sister
irritable
do
simply
take
yourself
out
of
her
way
look
around
and
do
something
kind
for
her
make
a
point
of
knowing
what
she
likes
and
of
doing
it
life
is
so
much
more
monotonous
for
women
than
for
men
you
should
be
especially
generous
with
your
sister
so
that
some
day
you
will
make
some
sweet
girl
a
good
husband
ca
you
just
what
kind
of
a
husband
that
boy
would
make
romance
comes
later
to
a
boy
than
to
a
girl
but
it
hits
him
just
as
hard
when
it
does
come
and
a
boy
is
quite
as
responsive
as
a
girl
to
the
suggestion
of
a
personal
chivalry
which
shall
prepare
him
to
be
a
better
husband
to
a
shadowy
personality
which
he
can
not
do
better
than
to
keep
in
his
mind
and
heart
why
does
a
woman
who
finds
it
difficult
perhaps
even
impossible
to
persuade
her
husband
to
do
certain
essential
things
never
take
pity
on
the
poor
little
girl
across
the
street
who
in
ten
or
fifteen
years
is
going
to
marry
her
son
take
at
random
the
subject
of
a
wife
having
an
allowance
thousands
of
wives
have
it
and
therefore
they
are
not
the
ones
we
are
to
consider
but
where
there
are
thousands
who
possess
an
allowance
from
their
husbands
or
who
have
money
in
their
own
right
there
are
millions
who
never
have
a
cent
they
are
not
obliged
to
ask
their
husbands
for
there
is
no
question
of
gift
about
it
at
the
altar
he
endowed
her
with
all
his
worldly
goods
and
he
thinks
he
has
lived
up
to
the
letter
of
his
vow
when
he
tells
her
that
all
he
has
is
as
much
hers
as
his
but
unless
that
saying
is
followed
up
by
a
certain
sum
no
matter
how
small
which
is
in
truth
her
very
own
she
feels
that
that
clause
in
the
marriage
service
might
as
well
be
stricken
out
when
wives
as
universally
share
in
adding
to
the
general
prosperity
of
the
home
by
managing
the
house
keeping
their
husband
clothes
in
order
and
caring
for
the
children
as
men
always
admit
is
the
case
wives
are
actually
adding
dollars
to
their
husband
income
then
ought
not
a
man
to
divide
that
same
income
with
her
in
the
form
of
an
allowance
for
which
if
only
to
add
to
her
he
has
no
more
right
to
call
her
to
account
than
she
has
to
insist
on
seeing
a
list
of
his
expenditures
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
extravagant
or
untrustworthy
wives
who
do
not
come
into
the
subject
at
all
i
am
only
referring
to
the
magnificent
multitude
of
good
careful
thrifty
typical
american
wives
whose
sole
aim
in
life
is
to
make
a
happy
home
for
husband
and
children
nor
am
i
denying
that
these
women
have
all
their
wishes
granted
and
are
allowed
to
spend
their
husbands
money
with
reasonable
freedom
provided
they
account
for
it
afterwards
i
am
only
asserting
that
every
married
woman
from
the
farmer
wife
to
that
of
the
bank
president
should
have
some
money
regularly
which
is
sacredly
her
own
perhaps
men
think
i
am
exaggerating
the
evil
perhaps
they
do
not
know
that
the
only
advice
married
women
give
to
engaged
girls
which
varies
is
be
sure
you
ask
for
an
allowance
from
the
first
because
if
you
do
you
may
never
get
it
i
suppose
that
the
majority
of
men
do
not
know
that
their
wives
hate
to
ask
them
for
money
of
course
it
does
not
seem
so
terrible
to
those
of
us
whose
fathers
occasionally
want
to
keep
back
enough
money
to
buy
coal
when
our
daughterly
demands
get
refused
but
it
never
occurs
to
us
that
a
girl
this
courteous
stranger
whom
she
has
loved
and
married
would
ever
forget
his
theatre
and
days
sufficiently
to
say
what
did
you
do
with
that
dollar
i
gave
you
yesterday
now
frankly
speaking
it
never
occurs
to
unmarried
girls
that
the
honeymoon
can
ever
wear
off
we
look
upon
husbands
as
only
married
sweethearts
we
sort
of
halfway
believe
them
at
least
we
used
to
before
we
observed
other
girls
husbands
when
they
tell
us
that
they
long
for
the
time
when
they
can
pay
our
bills
and
buy
clothes
for
us
we
never
thought
until
we
were
told
that
any
little
generous
arrangement
which
we
expected
to
last
must
be
fixed
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
marriage
i
dare
say
most
of
us
had
planned
to
say
in
answer
to
the
money
question
just
as
you
like
dear
i
rather
have
you
manage
such
matters
for
me
you
know
so
much
more
about
them
than
i
do
it
is
a
horrible
shock
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
to
be
told
to
say
i
take
an
allowance
please
and
then
if
two
amounts
are
mentioned
to
grab
for
the
biggest
oh
it
is
a
shame
it
is
a
shame
to
be
told
that
we
shall
be
sorry
if
we
do
and
to
know
that
we
shall
have
no
opportunity
to
show
how
unselfish
and
trusting
we
are
it
is
all
your
fault
you
men
that
you
do
not
think
of
these
things
more
you
might
stop
a
moment
to
consider
that
it
rather
a
delicate
matter
for
a
woman
to
ask
money
of
a
man
if
your
wife
is
like
most
wives
she
is
doing
as
much
to
help
you
make
your
money
as
you
are
she
is
keeping
you
well
and
happy
and
your
home
beautiful
you
could
not
keep
your
mind
on
business
an
hour
if
she
did
not
therefore
she
deserves
every
dollar
which
after
discussing
your
future
life
together
you
feel
that
you
can
afford
to
give
her
she
ought
to
be
made
to
feel
that
she
has
earned
it
and
that
she
may
spend
it
freely
and
happily
or
invest
it
just
as
she
chooses
do
you
think
that
you
would
not
get
the
whole
of
it
back
if
you
were
ill
and
needed
it
it
is
an
ungracious
thing
to
call
her
to
account
for
every
dollar
how
do
you
know
but
that
she
wants
to
save
a
little
out
of
the
to
buy
you
a
nicer
birthday
present
than
usual
american
men
are
the
most
lavish
husbands
in
the
world
it
is
only
that
they
do
not
think
what
a
joy
it
is
to
a
woman
to
have
even
the
smallest
amount
of
money
of
her
very
own
concerning
which
no
one
on
earth
has
a
right
to
question
her
and
yet
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
train
a
husband
into
a
habit
of
thought
like
this
when
he
has
been
used
to
hearing
his
mother
his
father
into
giving
her
money
and
yet
to
know
that
she
and
all
the
world
considered
him
generous
and
that
in
truth
he
was
a
woman
who
suffers
heartache
because
her
husband
never
apologizes
to
her
or
who
endures
mortification
unspeakable
because
she
has
not
a
penny
of
her
own
has
no
right
to
rebel
even
in
her
own
heart
unless
she
is
training
her
son
to
make
the
sort
of
husband
for
some
little
girl
now
in
pinafores
which
she
would
have
wished
for
herself
a
few
men
who
bore
us
the
man
somebody
has
cleverly
defined
a
bore
as
a
man
who
talks
so
much
about
himself
that
i
never
can
get
a
chance
to
talk
about
myself
but
that
is
too
narrow
i
am
i
want
somebody
to
find
a
definition
large
enough
if
possible
to
include
all
the
bores
i
do
not
know
however
but
that
i
am
asking
too
much
neither
is
this
definition
entirely
true
for
i
have
heard
men
talk
about
themselves
for
hours
at
a
time
and
they
talked
so
well
and
kept
their
ego
so
carefully
hidden
that
i
was
enchanted
and
never
mentioned
myself
even
when
they
paused
for
breath
then
too
i
have
been
bored
to
the
verge
of
suicide
by
some
worthy
soul
who
insisted
upon
talking
to
me
of
presumably
my
pet
subject
myself
and
who
was
doing
his
poor
little
best
to
say
nice
things
and
to
be
entertaining
a
bore
is
a
man
or
a
woman
who
never
knows
how
or
when
there
are
times
in
the
lives
of
all
of
us
when
it
bores
us
to
be
talked
to
of
home
or
friends
or
wife
or
husband
or
mother
or
religion
there
are
times
when
nothing
but
a
large
comfortable
silence
can
soothe
the
worry
and
fret
of
a
trying
day
at
such
times
let
the
tactless
woman
and
the
thoughtless
man
beware
because
everything
they
say
will
be
a
bore
it
is
not
wilful
cruelty
which
makes
us
say
that
to
a
woman
the
word
bore
is
in
the
masculine
gender
and
objective
case
object
of
our
deepest
detestation
men
are
oftener
bores
than
women
for
two
reasons
one
is
that
they
seldom
stop
to
think
that
they
could
be
a
bore
to
anybody
and
the
second
is
that
we
women
never
let
them
see
that
we
are
being
bored
for
it
is
our
aim
in
life
to
look
pleasant
and
to
keep
the
men
vanity
done
up
in
pink
cotton
no
matter
if
we
are
secretly
almost
dropping
from
our
chairs
with
weariness
the
utter
unspeakable
weariness
of
the
soul
compared
to
which
weariness
of
the
body
is
a
luxury
women
are
too
a
woman
can
not
bear
to
hurt
a
feelings
by
letting
him
know
that
he
is
killing
her
by
his
stupidity
and
even
if
she
did
in
the
noble
spirit
of
altruism
rather
than
selfishness
the
next
woman
with
one
reproachful
glance
at
her
would
pick
up
the
mutilated
remains
of
the
man
vanity
and
apply
the
splints
of
her
respectful
attention
and
the
balm
of
her
admiration
partly
to
add
a
new
scalp
to
her
belt
and
partly
to
show
off
the
unamiability
of
her
sister
woman
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
kick
against
the
pricks
bores
are
in
this
world
for
a
purpose
to
chasten
the
proud
spirit
of
women
who
otherwise
might
become
too
indolent
and
to
be
of
any
use
and
they
are
here
to
stay
we
have
no
conscience
concerning
women
bores
we
escape
from
them
ruthlessly
and
perhaps
because
women
are
quicker
to
take
a
hint
is
the
reason
there
are
fewer
of
them
it
is
only
the
men
who
are
left
helpless
in
their
ignorance
because
no
woman
has
the
courage
to
tell
them
our
only
defence
is
in
telling
the
men
in
bulk
what
we
have
not
the
courage
nor
the
wish
to
tell
the
individual
and
letting
them
sit
down
and
think
hard
applying
the
relentless
microscope
of
to
their
carefully
tended
ego
to
see
if
haply
any
of
these
things
we
say
apply
to
themselves
of
course
this
is
hard
on
men
because
very
likely
some
of
those
who
have
been
led
by
women
to
believe
that
they
are
entertaining
even
to
the
verge
of
fascination
are
the
very
ones
who
are
the
greatest
bores
but
we
women
do
our
best
we
are
hampered
by
our
supposed
amiability
and
bound
up
by
a
thousand
invisible
cords
of
tact
and
policy
to
a
line
of
action
which
dupes
the
cleverest
of
men
and
we
are
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
if
we
should
become
what
they
now
in
the
smart
of
their
wounded
vanity
would
call
honest
they
would
simply
turn
their
broadcloth
backs
upon
our
frankness
and
seek
the
honeyed
society
of
some
sweet
woman
who
flattered
them
exactly
as
we
used
to
flatter
them
before
we
became
so
honest
ah
enter
the
man
and
with
him
the
commercial
spirit
of
the
age
enter
the
clink
of
coin
and
the
unctuous
corpulence
of
a
roll
of
bills
enter
the
essence
of
the
glorious
spectacle
of
a
man
who
spells
myself
with
a
capital
have
you
never
noticed
the
change
in
conversation
with
the
entrance
of
a
new
person
how
when
a
lovely
girl
enters
the
men
all
straighten
their
ties
and
the
women
moisten
their
lips
how
when
the
new
person
is
a
man
with
his
newness
so
apparent
that
he
seems
to
exhale
the
odor
of
varnish
and
gilt
how
all
repose
vanishes
and
whatever
of
crudity
there
is
anywhere
suddenly
makes
itself
known
and
rushes
forth
to
meet
the
wave
of
which
sweeps
all
before
it
when
the
man
speaks
and
yet
i
approve
of
the
man
in
the
abstract
it
is
the
true
spirit
of
americanism
which
caused
him
to
raise
himself
from
the
ranks
of
the
poor
and
obscure
and
educate
himself
or
more
likely
still
grow
rich
without
education
but
is
it
necessary
for
him
to
have
the
bad
taste
to
boast
of
it
and
never
let
you
forget
for
one
moment
that
he
is
the
product
of
man
hand
and
that
the
creator
only
acted
in
the
capacity
of
sponsor
i
admire
the
pluck
the
perseverance
the
indomitable
energy
the
ambition
which
produced
the
man
of
prominence
from
the
raw
boy
but
kind
heaven
let
us
forget
for
one
brief
moment
if
we
can
that
he
did
this
thing
it
is
not
the
fact
that
he
is
a
man
that
bores
us
we
honor
him
for
that
but
it
is
his
vain
boasting
the
tactless
forcing
of
his
unwelcome
personality
into
general
conversation
his
weak
vanity
which
demands
our
admiration
for
the
toil
and
hardships
he
has
undergone
which
if
they
had
served
the
purpose
they
should
have
done
would
have
made
him
too
strong
a
man
and
too
much
of
a
man
to
force
either
pity
or
admiration
from
people
when
it
was
not
freely
offered
the
favorite
gibe
of
the
man
is
directed
against
the
college
graduate
let
there
be
a
young
fellow
present
who
is
fresh
from
college
and
let
him
mention
any
subject
connected
with
college
life
from
honors
to
athletics
and
then
if
you
are
hostess
sit
still
and
let
the
icy
waves
of
misery
creep
over
your
sensitive
soul
for
this
is
the
opportunity
of
his
life
to
the
man
hear
him
tear
colleges
limb
from
limb
and
cite
all
the
failures
of
which
he
ever
has
known
to
be
those
of
college
men
hear
him
tell
of
the
futile
efforts
of
college
boys
to
get
into
business
hear
him
drag
in
all
the
evidences
of
shattered
constitutions
ruined
by
study
and
then
hold
your
breath
for
all
this
is
but
preliminary
to
the
telling
of
the
story
of
a
colossal
success
the
history
of
the
man
you
might
as
well
lean
back
and
let
him
have
his
say
for
he
has
only
been
waiting
all
this
time
for
an
opening
in
the
conversation
to
insert
the
wedge
of
his
ego
it
seems
to
be
the
prerogative
of
some
men
not
only
to
boast
of
themselves
their
wives
their
sons
their
daughters
their
houses
their
horses
everything
but
to
decry
all
methods
of
achievement
not
their
own
and
all
successes
not
won
by
their
methods
these
are
the
men
who
bring
into
disrepute
all
the
grandeur
and
glorious
achievement
of
their
kind
why
must
they
spoil
it
i
implore
them
to
assume
a
virtue
if
they
have
it
not
i
beg
them
with
all
their
getting
to
get
understanding
and
if
they
will
not
open
their
eyes
and
see
the
anguish
they
are
causing
if
they
can
not
detect
the
fixed
smile
of
polite
endurance
on
the
tired
faces
of
their
patient
women
friends
there
will
come
a
day
and
we
can
already
see
its
faint
glimmering
in
the
east
when
we
shall
not
care
whether
they
are
and
we
could
even
live
through
it
if
they
were
not
made
at
all
the
dyspeptic
the
dyspeptic
generally
wants
to
tell
you
all
about
it
that
is
a
bore
to
begin
with
for
nobody
in
the
world
wants
to
hear
anybody
in
the
world
tell
all
about
anything
in
the
world
oh
those
wearisome
breathless
people
who
insist
upon
giving
you
the
tiresome
details
of
insipid
trivialities
there
is
no
escape
from
them
they
are
everywhere
they
are
to
be
found
on
farms
in
in
clubs
in
churches
jails
and
lunatic
asylums
and
the
nearest
approach
to
a
release
from
them
is
to
be
fashionable
for
in
society
nobody
ever
is
allowed
to
finish
a
sentence
this
sort
of
a
bore
can
only
be
explained
on
the
microbe
theory
none
other
can
account
for
its
universality
you
can
carry
contagion
of
it
in
your
clothes
and
inoculate
a
person
of
weak
mental
constitution
who
is
of
a
build
to
take
anything
until
in
a
fortnight
he
or
she
will
be
a
hopeless
slave
to
the
habit
there
is
nothing
like
the
pleasing
swiftness
of
some
of
our
modern
diseases
about
it
such
as
heart
failure
which
nips
you
off
painlessly
it
is
rather
like
the
new
england
consumption
which
gives
you
a
hectic
flush
and
an
irritating
hack
but
which
you
can
thrive
on
for
fifty
years
and
then
die
of
something
else
i
never
heard
of
a
yacht
which
did
not
carry
at
least
one
of
this
particular
breed
of
bores
upon
every
trip
i
never
heard
of
a
party
which
was
free
from
it
or
if
you
do
not
carry
them
with
you
you
meet
them
on
the
way
and
they
ruin
the
sunset
for
the
whole
party
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it
there
ought
to
be
a
on
bores
mothers
ought
to
train
their
children
to
avoid
lying
and
boring
people
with
equal
earnestness
infirmaries
should
be
established
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
stupid
interesting
or
classes
organized
on
how
to
be
brief
or
on
the
art
of
relating
salient
points
or
on
the
best
method
of
skipping
the
unessentials
in
conversation
would
go
for
one
i
quite
envy
a
man
who
is
an
acknowledged
bore
he
is
so
free
from
responsibility
does
not
care
that
the
conversation
dies
every
time
he
shows
his
face
he
is
used
to
it
it
is
nothing
to
him
that
clever
men
and
women
ache
audibly
in
his
presence
has
no
reputation
to
lose
the
hostess
is
not
a
friend
of
his
for
whom
he
feels
that
he
must
exert
himself
a
bore
no
friends
he
is
a
social
leech
it
implies
first
of
all
a
superb
conceit
to
think
anybody
wishes
one
to
tell
all
about
anything
but
conceit
is
a
natural
attribute
a
twin
brother
of
its
sister
vanity
and
everybody
has
it
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
indeed
the
cleverest
man
i
know
quite
the
cleverest
is
one
who
always
panders
to
this
particular
foible
because
he
recognizes
its
universality
he
has
a
which
is
always
full
of
guests
with
a
great
many
girls
among
them
every
afternoon
when
he
drives
out
from
town
his
first
sentence
is
now
come
children
and
tell
me
all
about
everything
who
has
been
here
and
what
they
said
and
what
you
thought
and
everything
that
has
happened
including
all
that
is
going
to
happen
do
skip
a
word
see
the
base
flattery
of
that
is
it
any
wonder
that
his
house
is
always
full
what
bores
he
would
be
responsible
for
making
if
we
were
stupid
enough
to
do
as
he
asks
the
chief
reason
people
do
not
is
that
ten
people
can
not
tell
all
they
know
about
everything
even
if
they
want
to
he
is
only
furnished
with
two
ears
the
dyspeptic
is
one
who
makes
the
most
valiant
effort
to
try
his
dyspepsia
is
the
most
important
issue
of
the
world
with
him
and
he
talk
about
it
he
can
not
keep
still
and
let
other
people
enjoy
their
sound
digestion
and
healthful
sleep
he
will
not
even
let
other
people
eat
in
peace
when
he
refuses
a
dish
at
table
he
must
needs
tell
you
why
just
as
if
you
cared
have
some
coffee
mr
bore
no
i
thank
you
madame
i
like
coffee
but
it
does
like
me
irritating
maddeningly
reiterated
words
the
of
the
dyspeptic
bore
i
feel
like
saying
i
agree
with
the
coffee
do
like
you
either
a
dyspeptic
disagrees
with
me
as
religiously
as
if
i
had
eaten
him
no
wonder
a
man
is
ill
who
never
thinks
or
talks
of
anything
but
the
seat
of
his
ailment
for
talk
about
it
he
will
and
tell
you
that
he
can
not
eat
hot
breads
or
pastry
or
or
waffles
and
if
any
of
those
adorable
things
which
your
soul
loves
are
on
the
table
he
will
sit
and
watch
you
eat
them
with
his
hand
on
his
own
pulse
and
will
entertain
you
with
cheerful
statements
of
how
he
would
be
feeling
if
were
eating
any
of
the
deadly
poisons
until
it
nearly
gives
you
indigestion
to
hear
him
describe
it
i
dare
say
i
know
plenty
of
women
dyspeptics
as
long
as
dyspepsia
is
said
to
be
our
national
ailment
but
if
i
do
i
never
hear
them
talk
about
it
of
course
every
woman
knows
that
a
sick
man
is
sicker
than
a
thousand
sick
women
each
of
whom
is
twice
as
sick
as
he
is
we
all
know
that
he
can
groan
louder
and
roll
his
eyes
higher
and
keep
more
people
flying
about
and
all
this
with
just
a
plain
pain
than
his
wife
would
do
with
seven
fatal
ailments
then
to
hear
him
tell
about
it
after
he
has
recovered
is
to
imagine
that
he
is
lazarus
over
again
and
that
the
day
of
miracles
has
returned
that
he
ever
lived
to
tell
the
tale
all
this
refers
to
an
acute
attack
but
when
his
trouble
is
chronic
and
it
has
to
do
like
dyspepsia
with
a
man
eating
you
can
not
escape
he
tell
you
all
about
it
in
the
first
place
dyspepsia
is
such
a
refined
and
trouble
it
has
no
disgusting
details
you
can
refer
to
it
at
all
times
without
fear
of
nauseating
your
hearers
in
the
second
place
you
can
count
on
nearly
half
of
your
hearers
having
it
too
as
dyspepsia
is
almost
as
catching
as
christian
science
carlyle
was
the
most
famous
of
dyspeptics
but
magnificent
as
he
was
in
his
growling
i
fancy
it
is
more
bearable
to
read
about
it
than
it
was
for
that
adorable
wife
of
his
to
hear
him
talk
about
it
how
well
we
can
imagine
her
feelings
when
she
wrote
the
amount
of
bile
that
he
brings
home
is
awfully
grand
but
one
forgives
much
of
his
dyspeptic
talk
and
even
allows
the
mantle
of
one
christian
charity
to
cover
the
sins
of
lesser
men
to
hear
how
he
sums
up
the
subject
with
stupidity
and
sound
digestion
man
may
front
much
but
what
in
these
dull
unimaginative
days
are
the
terrors
of
conscience
to
the
diseases
of
the
liver
not
on
morality
but
on
cookery
let
us
build
our
stronghold
there
brandishing
our
as
censer
let
us
offer
sweet
incense
to
the
devil
and
live
at
ease
on
the
fat
things
he
has
provided
for
his
elect
i
really
do
feel
sorry
for
dyspeptics
when
i
read
a
thing
like
that
i
am
not
heartless
it
must
be
a
sad
thing
not
to
be
able
to
eat
lobster
and
together
and
to
have
to
say
no
to
broiled
mushrooms
and
not
to
dare
to
eat
after
the
theatre
and
to
have
to
lock
up
your
but
i
do
say
this
unless
a
man
can
talk
of
his
trouble
as
cleverly
as
carlyle
and
some
of
the
choice
dyspeptics
i
know
can
almost
do
that
i
want
them
not
to
talk
at
all
if
they
suffer
let
them
do
it
in
silence
if
they
die
let
them
die
entertainingly
or
else
i
say
do
die
in
public
i
never
see
a
dyspeptic
with
his
little
pair
of
silver
scales
on
the
table
weighing
out
two
ounces
of
meat
or
one
ounce
of
bread
and
looking
like
a
at
a
feast
and
talking
like
a
with
yorick
skull
for
a
theme
that
i
do
not
think
of
this
fantastic
tricks
enough
man
has
played
in
his
time
has
fancied
himself
to
be
most
things
even
down
to
an
animated
heap
of
glass
but
to
fancy
himself
a
dead
iron
balance
for
weighing
pains
and
pleasures
on
was
reserved
for
this
his
latter
era
the
man
women
often
complain
that
men
in
society
will
not
return
measure
for
measure
in
conversation
but
stalk
about
dumb
and
unanswering
leaving
women
gasping
from
the
fatigue
of
entertaining
them
but
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
men
i
always
am
they
are
a
misjudged
and
maligned
set
i
approve
of
men
keeping
silence
when
they
have
nothing
to
say
it
shows
that
they
recognize
their
limitations
and
refuse
to
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
is
not
a
wise
silence
sometimes
to
be
preferred
to
the
wisest
speech
is
there
not
often
a
finer
eloquence
in
an
answering
silence
than
the
cleverest
words
could
express
a
man
who
talks
constantly
has
a
thousand
ways
always
at
hand
in
which
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
a
silent
man
has
but
one
and
even
then
there
are
always
those
who
insist
upon
thinking
that
he
is
silent
because
of
his
wisdom
and
not
from
lack
of
it
although
eliza
leslie
says
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
when
a
head
is
full
of
ideas
some
of
them
must
involuntarily
ooze
out
but
as
a
stimulus
to
conversation
an
intelligently
silent
man
is
as
instantaneous
in
his
effect
as
music
or
eating
men
have
become
famous
as
conversationists
who
only
sat
and
looked
admiringly
at
vivacious
women
it
is
a
rare
accomplishment
that
of
wise
silence
it
is
more
of
a
delicate
compliment
more
condensed
and
flattery
more
scent
of
incense
than
the
most
fulsome
speech
and
if
victim
is
rather
a
voluble
talker
with
a
reputation
for
wit
a
man
need
never
rack
his
brains
beforehand
wondering
what
to
say
or
how
he
can
keep
up
with
her
let
him
listen
to
her
with
his
metaphorical
mouth
open
in
wrapt
admiration
and
she
is
his
silence
is
a
weapon
it
is
a
powerful
corrective
when
used
against
a
silent
person
who
then
sees
himself
as
others
see
him
it
is
a
defence
used
against
the
indiscreet
and
in
the
hands
of
wise
men
it
is
a
suit
of
armor
silence
is
never
dangerous
unless
like
a
gun
in
the
hands
of
a
fool
how
then
can
women
complain
of
silent
men
unless
they
mean
fools
and
if
they
do
why
not
say
so
and
fortify
their
with
or
magic
lanterns
but
anything
so
negatively
unhappy
as
silence
is
the
least
of
bores
one
is
seldom
annoyed
by
the
persistence
of
a
silent
man
for
silence
often
means
shyness
therefore
it
is
in
our
power
to
curtail
his
usefulness
but
on
the
other
hand
take
a
type
of
the
talkative
man
the
literal
man
who
insists
upon
finishing
his
sentences
and
who
will
stop
to
dot
his
i
and
to
cross
his
t
and
whose
dates
are
of
more
moment
than
his
soul
salvation
can
anything
be
done
for
avoid
giving
invitations
to
bores
says
a
clever
woman
they
will
come
without
alas
how
true
the
man
is
ubiquitous
if
you
hear
of
him
and
refuse
to
meet
him
it
is
only
to
find
that
he
has
married
your
best
friend
whom
worlds
could
not
bribe
you
to
give
up
if
you
weed
him
out
of
your
acquaintance
it
is
only
to
realize
that
he
was
born
into
your
relationship
a
generation
ago
before
you
could
prevent
it
sometimes
he
is
your
father
sometimes
your
brother
both
of
these
however
can
be
lived
down
but
occasionally
you
discover
that
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
you
have
married
him
heaven
help
you
then
for
marriage
stays
with
one
like
a
murder
imagine
living
all
one
life
with
a
man
who
relates
thus
the
trivial
incident
of
having
walked
with
a
friend
up
broadway
last
thursday
afternoon
when
he
met
two
little
boys
about
ten
years
old
who
asked
him
to
buy
a
paper
last
week
thursday
i
think
it
was
though
perhaps
it
was
friday
or
maybe
saturday
let
me
see
when
did
i
leave
my
office
early
it
must
have
been
thursday
because
friday
i
stayed
later
than
usual
yes
it
thursday
it
was
about
four
perhaps
a
little
later
a
quarter
after
four
or
maybe
but
i
hardly
think
it
could
have
been
as
late
as
that
i
think
it
was
nearer
four
than
anyway
i
was
walking
up
broadway
with
a
man
by
the
name
of
bigelow
bigelow
bigelow
was
that
his
name
it
commenced
with
b
and
had
two
syllables
boswell
blackwell
blayney
what
that
fellow
name
i
never
can
tell
a
story
unless
i
get
the
man
name
right
bilton
bashforth
buckby
no
not
buckby
but
that
sounds
like
it
buckley
that
it
that
was
his
name
i
knew
i
get
it
well
i
was
walking
up
broadway
with
buckley
and
at
about
street
wait
a
moment
it
street
it
could
have
been
that
far
up
about
street
i
think
i
do
quite
remember
whether
we
had
passed
the
imperial
or
not
but
it
was
within
a
block
of
it
anyway
when
we
met
two
little
boys
about
ten
years
old
perhaps
one
was
a
little
older
one
looked
about
ten
and
the
other
about
eleven
or
perhaps
even
twelve
although
i
think
ten
would
come
nearer
to
it
and
they
asked
us
in
a
tone
between
a
whine
and
a
cry
the
word
whimper
more
nearly
describes
it
if
we
would
buy
either
a
or
a
i
forgotten
which
delectable
as
honesty
is
in
a
bank
clerk
or
would
be
in
a
lawyer
one
yearns
for
a
little
less
accuracy
in
the
moral
makeup
of
the
man
for
a
little
of
the
celestial
leaven
of
exaggeration
in
the
dusty
dryness
of
his
garrulousness
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
revolutionary
war
took
place
before
or
after
the
discovery
of
america
as
long
as
you
make
your
war
anecdote
interesting
who
cares
whether
napoleon
or
wellington
came
out
ahead
at
waterloo
as
long
as
your
listener
is
kept
awake
by
your
recital
i
related
a
sprightly
incident
only
last
night
about
a
watch
which
francis
the
second
gave
to
mary
stuart
only
with
my
usual
airy
touch
i
said
francis
the
second
gave
it
to
marie
antoinette
what
difference
does
it
make
they
were
both
marys
and
they
are
both
dead
a
most
unpleasant
old
party
corrected
me
and
added
francis
died
about
two
hundred
years
before
marie
antoinette
was
born
then
all
the
more
of
a
compliment
that
he
should
have
given
her
the
watch
i
said
and
i
fancy
i
had
him
there
that
is
the
sort
of
man
who
interrupts
his
wife
all
the
way
through
with
my
dear
ouida
not
emerson
herod
not
homer
until
should
be
surprised
to
see
her
throw
a
plate
at
his
head
oh
is
it
fine
that
one
does
not
dare
to
do
all
the
things
one
feels
like
doing
in
society
there
is
only
one
way
to
get
even
with
the
man
and
that
is
when
he
has
finished
his
most
exciting
story
to
say
and
then
what
happened
next
accuracy
is
almost
fatal
to
a
flow
of
spirits
if
one
is
obliged
to
weigh
one
words
one
may
live
to
be
called
a
worthy
old
soul
but
one
will
not
be
in
demand
at
the
man
need
not
pride
himself
upon
his
honesty
above
his
oftenest
he
is
to
be
found
paying
lithe
of
mint
anise
and
cumin
and
neglecting
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
justice
mercy
and
truth
he
strains
at
a
gnat
and
swallows
a
camel
he
is
not
more
trustworthy
than
the
man
whose
conversation
is
embellished
with
hyperbole
because
he
at
least
has
the
wit
to
discriminate
and
the
man
is
only
stupid
in
essentials
the
man
who
decorates
his
conversation
with
mild
but
pleasing
patterns
of
that
style
of
statement
made
famous
by
one
ananias
is
to
be
depended
upon
quite
as
surely
as
the
man
who
takes
all
the
sunshine
from
the
day
and
leads
one
thoughts
to
dwell
on
high
by
spending
ten
minutes
trying
to
recall
whether
he
dropped
that
stone
on
his
foot
before
or
after
dinner
he
and
not
your
own
evil
nature
should
be
responsible
for
your
instinctive
wish
that
he
had
happened
to
be
toying
with
a
bowlder
instead
of
a
small
stone
which
could
only
mutilate
the
painful
accuracy
which
makes
some
men
such
deadly
bores
is
a
form
of
monomania
it
is
the
same
sort
of
trouble
which
afflicts
a
kleptomaniac
she
will
steal
the
veriest
trash
just
so
she
can
be
stealing
he
hoards
the
most
useless
trifles
until
his
mind
is
nothing
but
a
garret
filled
with
isolated
bits
of
rubbish
that
nobody
wants
to
hear
unless
one
has
an
essay
to
write
and
even
then
it
is
easier
to
consult
the
encyclopaedia
i
never
believe
a
statement
made
by
a
man
one
bit
more
quickly
than
one
made
by
a
genial
entertaining
if
it
were
on
the
subject
of
timetables
just
between
ourselves
i
should
take
the
trouble
to
verify
both
the
irresistible
man
to
other
men
the
irresistible
man
too
often
means
the
man
who
publicly
ogles
women
that
is
because
men
can
him
but
to
women
what
we
can
see
forms
but
a
small
portion
of
our
lives
we
hear
more
than
we
see
and
feel
more
than
we
hear
george
eliot
says
the
best
of
us
go
about
well
wadded
with
stupidity
otherwise
we
would
die
of
the
roar
that
lies
on
the
other
side
of
silence
but
most
men
have
to
see
things
and
they
can
always
see
the
ogling
man
and
he
always
makes
them
perfectly
furious
queer
is
it
when
the
simon
tappertits
of
this
life
are
the
least
of
the
men
who
bore
us
in
fact
i
never
should
have
thought
of
him
if
some
man
had
not
spoken
of
him
and
while
i
occasionally
have
been
honored
by
the
exertions
of
one
of
these
insects
to
attract
my
attention
thereby
proving
that
i
am
a
woman
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
never
remember
seeing
one
women
who
are
capable
of
being
really
never
even
see
such
men
any
more
than
if
you
were
being
roasted
alive
you
would
care
if
a
hairpin
pulled
it
is
a
mistake
to
confound
the
irresistible
man
with
the
fool
neither
is
he
stupid
very
often
he
is
a
man
of
no
small
amount
of
brain
he
is
of
course
always
conceited
and
generally
though
not
always
handsome
i
am
not
describing
the
soft
sapient
pretty
man
who
lisps
nor
the
young
gentleman
with
pink
cheeks
who
sings
tenor
far
worse
the
irresistible
man
as
know
him
is
often
a
man
who
is
doing
a
man
work
in
the
world
and
doing
it
well
he
is
frequently
a
man
of
character
but
through
that
character
runs
this
strange
irritating
thread
of
conceit
which
blinds
our
eyes
to
whatever
of
real
worth
may
be
within
because
of
his
exasperatingly
confident
exterior
we
should
brush
him
aside
as
carelessly
as
if
he
were
a
fly
should
there
be
nothing
to
him
worth
hating
but
the
maddening
part
of
it
to
us
is
that
the
irresistible
man
is
worth
saving
only
he
will
not
be
saved
he
thinks
he
is
perfect
as
he
is
if
he
could
get
our
point
of
view
and
let
some
woman
take
a
hand
at
him
she
might
efface
his
irresistibleness
and
make
a
man
of
him
but
no
the
irresistible
man
is
in
this
world
to
give
points
not
take
them
a
queer
thing
about
this
particular
type
of
the
irresistible
man
is
that
he
nearly
always
has
grown
up
in
a
small
town
and
has
only
come
to
the
city
because
his
village
got
too
small
for
his
talents
that
of
itself
explains
his
whole
attitude
towards
the
world
having
probably
been
the
show
pupil
at
school
having
taken
prizes
and
ranked
first
among
his
fellows
until
he
was
he
brings
that
confident
attitude
with
him
and
plants
himself
in
the
heart
of
the
great
city
like
ajax
defying
the
lightning
without
the
thought
that
changed
environments
might
demand
change
of
conduct
as
well
as
change
in
clothes
doubtless
the
whole
town
helped
to
spoil
him
doubtless
he
has
heard
all
his
life
that
the
town
was
too
small
for
him
and
that
a
man
like
himself
ought
to
go
to
the
city
where
there
would
be
a
market
for
his
talents
doubtless
he
has
conquered
the
hearts
of
all
the
village
maidens
therefore
he
expects
the
same
arts
to
win
among
city
girls
this
system
of
easy
victory
and
of
yearning
for
other
worlds
to
conquer
instead
of
making
him
fit
himself
capably
for
a
larger
field
has
on
account
of
this
absurd
fault
of
irresistibleness
only
made
him
superficial
his
crudeness
is
to
the
uninitiated
almost
pitiful
having
never
been
obliged
to
work
for
he
descries
exertion
and
never
admits
that
he
has
to
try
hard
to
win
anything
his
cheap
little
accomplishments
of
singing
badly
possibly
even
of
reciting
dialect
with
realistic
effects
he
is
accustomed
to
say
he
just
picked
up
i
often
have
thought
that
he
must
have
picked
them
up
after
somebody
else
had
thrown
them
away
but
they
have
been
efficacious
in
his
town
and
in
a
larger
field
with
foemen
more
worthy
of
his
steel
they
are
intended
to
enslave
the
irresistible
man
is
too
pitiful
to
laugh
at
with
any
degree
of
comfort
the
pathos
of
the
situation
is
almost
too
apparent
that
is
one
reason
why
he
is
allowed
to
go
on
as
he
is
it
is
why
no
one
has
the
heart
to
try
to
correct
him
what
you
say
to
a
man
whose
confidence
in
his
power
to
please
you
is
such
that
at
parting
he
says
i
can
not
spare
you
another
evening
this
week
but
i
come
next
thursday
if
i
can
do
expect
me
however
until
i
let
you
know
and
do
be
disappointed
if
you
find
that
i
ca
come
after
all
to
be
sure
you
have
not
asked
him
to
repeat
his
visit
at
all
to
be
sure
you
have
nearly
died
during
this
call
which
is
just
over
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
we
have
a
white
bulldog
whose
confident
attitude
towards
the
world
is
quite
like
that
of
the
irresistible
man
jack
blunders
in
where
nobody
wants
him
and
puts
his
great
heavy
paw
on
our
best
gowns
and
scratches
at
the
door
when
we
want
to
sleep
and
gets
under
our
feet
when
we
are
trying
to
catch
a
train
and
makes
a
nuisance
of
himself
generally
but
he
is
so
sure
that
we
love
him
that
we
have
the
heart
to
turn
him
we
simply
endure
him
because
he
is
a
dumb
brute
who
is
so
used
to
being
petted
that
everybody
tolerates
him
and
nobody
tries
to
improve
him
or
teach
him
better
manners
confidence
is
a
beautiful
thing
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
delicate
of
attributes
and
requires
the
daintiest
handling
the
man
who
is
confident
with
women
must
be
very
sure
of
a
personal
magnetism
or
of
sufficient
merit
to
insure
success
otherwise
his
confidence
will
prove
the
flattest
of
failures
the
only
difference
between
the
irresistible
man
who
bores
us
to
death
and
the
successful
man
who
is
so
fascinating
that
he
can
not
come
too
often
is
that
one
has
confidence
with
nothing
to
base
it
on
and
the
other
bases
his
confidence
on
fact
women
are
not
looking
for
flaws
in
men
they
are
only
too
anxious
to
make
the
best
of
sorry
specimens
and
shut
their
eyes
to
faults
and
to
coax
virtues
into
prominence
men
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
way
women
in
society
treat
them
they
get
better
than
they
deserve
and
much
better
than
they
give
so
all
they
will
have
to
do
to
win
a
better
opinion
will
be
to
deserve
it
and
if
they
make
never
so
slight
an
advance
they
will
see
that
they
are
met
more
than
by
even
the
most
captious
critics
of
their
acquaintance
adaptability
is
a
gift
it
is
like
the
straw
used
in
packing
china
it
not
only
saves
jarring
but
it
prevents
worse
disasters
and
without
it
a
man
is
only
safe
when
he
is
alone
the
moment
he
comes
into
smart
contact
with
his
there
is
a
crash
and
the
assembled
company
have
a
vision
of
broken
fragments
of
humanity
which
might
have
remained
whole
and
suffered
no
more
injury
than
a
possible
nick
had
the
combatants
been
padded
with
adaptability
the
irresistible
man
is
the
man
who
thinks
he
can
get
through
the
world
without
it
the
irresistible
man
is
the
one
who
is
so
perfect
in
his
own
estimation
that
he
needs
no
change
he
is
beyond
human
help
the
stupid
man
his
opposite
the
clever
man
said
to
me
yesterday
you
know
to
be
actually
interested
is
as
likely
to
make
one
grateful
as
anything
in
this
world
unless
it
be
a
realization
of
the
kindness
of
fate
in
sparing
us
the
perpetual
society
of
fools
the
perpetual
society
of
fools
think
of
it
and
then
revel
you
women
in
the
thought
that
we
are
only
bored
occasionally
once
a
week
say
or
once
a
day
or
once
every
two
hours
taking
our
bores
as
we
do
medicine
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
i
heard
that
phrase
that
life
held
anything
more
wearisome
than
to
be
bored
occasionally
i
have
read
and
thought
how
awful
it
would
be
to
be
a
i
have
read
seats
of
the
and
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
being
imprisoned
for
five
years
alone
and
without
a
light
i
have
seen
a
flock
of
sheep
driven
by
shouting
panting
racing
little
boys
and
have
been
glad
i
did
not
have
to
drive
sheep
for
my
daily
bread
i
have
rejoiced
that
my
lot
was
not
that
of
a
paris
but
i
never
in
all
my
life
thought
of
any
fate
so
appalling
as
that
contained
in
those
words
the
perpetual
society
of
fools
why
not
reform
our
penitentiary
methods
what
is
a
prison
cell
to
a
clever
embezzler
if
he
can
have
books
and
a
pipe
nothing
but
a
long
rest
for
his
nerves
possibly
a
grateful
change
but
what
would
be
the
feelings
of
a
man
of
brilliant
intellect
for
the
accomplished
villain
is
always
clever
who
was
detected
in
his
crime
and
who
stood
breathless
before
his
accusers
waiting
for
and
expecting
a
life
sentence
at
hard
labor
to
hear
the
judge
voice
pronounce
sentence
condemned
for
life
to
the
perpetual
society
of
fools
i
believe
the
man
would
be
taken
from
the
a
raving
maniac
i
can
not
but
think
that
a
real
fool
is
conscious
of
his
own
foolishness
he
must
realize
his
aloofness
from
the
rest
of
mankind
and
in
moments
of
such
bitter
i
can
picture
many
whom
the
world
regards
as
too
far
gone
to
comprehend
their
calamity
praying
the
prayer
of
the
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
fool
i
am
a
little
tender
towards
such
i
do
not
condemn
them
they
have
reached
the
stage
when
they
are
the
victims
of
human
pity
a
lamentable
condition
but
those
dense
persons
inhabiting
the
thickly
populated
region
bordering
on
foolishness
those
uncomprehending
egotists
occupying
the
house
between
wisdom
and
folly
known
as
stupidity
against
such
my
wrath
burns
fiercely
they
are
deceptive
so
they
wear
the
semblance
of
wisdom
yet
it
is
but
a
cloak
to
snare
and
delude
mankind
into
testing
their
intelligence
they
are
not
labelled
by
heaven
like
the
fools
we
may
avoid
if
we
will
or
to
whom
we
may
go
in
a
spirit
of
philanthropy
they
do
not
wear
straw
in
their
hair
like
maniacs
nor
drool
like
simpletons
now
they
infest
society
clad
in
the
most
immaculate
of
evening
clothes
often
they
are
college
graduates
and
get
along
very
well
with
other
men
they
are
frequently
found
among
the
rich
sometimes
even
among
the
poor
sometimes
they
are
stolid
and
can
not
understand
sometimes
they
are
indifferent
and
wo
understand
sometimes
they
are
english
we
women
are
those
upon
whose
souls
their
stupidity
bears
most
heavily
but
stay
they
do
not
oppress
all
women
alike
there
are
women
whose
spiritual
needs
never
soar
above
the
alphabet
when
these
men
are
men
of
family
and
one
expects
to
find
their
wives
sitting
with
clinched
hands
and
set
teeth
simply
enduring
life
and
praying
for
death
one
is
often
surprised
to
see
that
they
are
generally
stout
women
who
wear
many
diamonds
and
a
bovine
expression
in
their
eyes
evidently
there
is
no
nervous
tension
in
their
house
and
the
dense
man
is
quite
capable
of
comprehending
the
a
b
c
of
human
nature
and
of
keeping
his
family
in
flannels
in
strictly
fashionable
society
the
stupid
man
is
not
conspicuous
because
one
never
has
time
to
comprehend
that
one
is
not
understood
if
he
nods
his
head
sagely
and
says
nothing
one
is
probably
grateful
and
passes
on
to
the
next
thinking
that
he
is
most
entertaining
but
in
that
society
where
one
sometimes
sits
down
and
breathes
where
conversation
is
considered
as
a
fine
art
and
where
talk
is
a
mutual
game
of
battledoor
and
shuttlecock
then
it
is
that
your
stupid
man
looms
up
on
the
horizon
like
a
blanket
of
clouds
in
america
particularly
conversation
is
something
which
not
even
the
french
who
approach
it
most
nearly
can
thoroughly
understand
for
with
all
its
blinding
nimbleness
and
kaleidoscopic
changes
there
is
a
substratum
of
puritan
morality
which
holds
some
things
sacred
too
sacred
even
to
argue
in
public
and
one
who
transgresses
turns
off
the
colored
lights
and
lo
your
conversation
is
all
in
grays
and
browns
to
converse
properly
in
america
one
must
possess
not
only
a
nimble
wit
and
a
broad
understanding
but
he
must
take
into
consideration
pedigree
and
the
effect
of
the
climate
this
practically
bars
the
stupid
man
from
ever
hearing
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
outside
the
secluded
walls
of
his
own
home
or
should
it
ought
also
to
bar
the
simply
witty
man
for
what
is
more
jarring
than
a
misplaced
wit
or
an
jocularity
no
the
chief
requisite
for
a
seat
among
the
glorious
company
of
the
elect
is
a
sensitive
comprehension
a
capacity
to
see
not
only
through
a
thing
but
over
it
and
under
it
and
beyond
it
to
see
not
only
its
derivation
and
ancestry
but
its
purport
and
import
and
influence
and
posterity
to
detect
the
inner
meaning
and
the
double
meaning
and
to
smile
alone
at
its
surface
meaning
there
are
those
of
us
particularly
women
who
must
have
this
comprehension
if
we
are
to
be
thought
fit
to
live
our
conversation
is
such
that
if
we
were
taken
literally
we
deserve
to
be
strangled
in
this
day
of
mad
competition
in
every
walk
in
life
it
is
not
those
who
can
shout
the
loudest
even
in
those
busy
marts
where
voice
reigns
supreme
who
are
going
to
be
heard
no
one
man
can
continue
to
shout
the
loudest
a
momentary
audience
and
a
raw
throat
are
the
most
he
can
expect
but
it
is
he
who
can
exaggerate
the
most
intelligently
and
overpaint
the
most
subtly
that
sort
of
impertinence
will
attract
the
eye
and
ear
of
the
most
loudly
howling
mob
even
the
wayfarer
gets
an
inkling
from
a
poster
but
it
is
a
man
of
the
widest
comprehension
who
gets
the
whole
truth
from
the
subtlest
exaggeration
and
he
who
possesses
a
sense
of
humor
who
realizes
its
acuteness
to
persons
of
this
ilk
the
stupid
man
is
a
calamity
compared
to
which
the
loss
of
fortune
and
begging
would
be
a
luxury
but
of
course
there
are
grades
of
stupidity
even
among
stupid
men
and
of
these
the
educated
stupid
man
is
perhaps
the
most
exhausting
because
a
woman
is
constantly
led
into
trying
to
converse
with
him
having
heard
rumors
that
he
is
a
college
man
or
that
he
has
written
a
book
on
mathematics
if
a
man
is
a
genuine
fool
of
course
one
would
merely
show
him
pictures
or
play
games
with
him
and
so
save
brain
tissue
but
with
the
deceptive
halfway
man
one
is
defenceless
a
single
instance
of
a
conversation
will
serve
as
a
fearful
warning
to
the
unwary
a
graduate
of
a
german
university
a
man
who
has
written
three
books
and
has
a
reputation
for
always
winning
his
lawsuits
sought
me
out
after
a
dinner
with
the
fatal
accuracy
of
a
man
who
has
dined
to
repletion
and
wishes
to
be
amused
possibly
because
i
also
had
dined
and
was
therefore
affable
i
endeavored
to
see
if
there
was
any
forgotten
corner
of
his
mind
any
blind
alley
i
hitherto
had
left
unexplored
where
i
might
find
mine
own
and
feel
at
home
his
face
was
dull
heavy
unemotional
but
i
said
in
sprightly
tones
to
coax
his
lethargy
i
have
made
such
a
delicious
discovery
i
have
found
that
carlyle
has
given
the
most
acute
definition
of
humor
i
ever
read
is
that
rather
surprising
when
carlyle
humor
is
rather
lumbering
he
thought
a
moment
it
is
he
said
carefully
with
that
want
of
recklessness
which
should
endear
him
to
a
stone
image
do
you
know
it
or
shall
i
tell
you
i
said
with
fatal
geniality
another
pause
tell
me
he
said
heavily
wadding
his
mind
with
cotton
for
fear
some
lightness
should
percolate
through
it
why
he
said
that
humor
was
an
appreciation
of
the
under
side
of
things
is
that
delicious
i
spoke
with
unctuous
satisfaction
for
i
really
expected
him
to
comprehend
he
looked
at
my
beaming
countenance
with
grave
suspicion
and
slowly
reddened
he
said
nothing
i
still
smiled
but
my
smile
was
fast
freezing
well
i
said
impatiently
you
are
jesting
he
said
that
is
the
real
answer
why
yes
it
is
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
understand
you
jest
so
much
i
never
can
tell
he
broke
off
helplessly
but
surely
you
see
that
i
urged
how
would
define
humor
why
humor
is
something
funny
there
nothing
funny
about
er
that
that
carlyle
said
yes
but
it
only
a
very
delicate
and
occult
way
of
exhibiting
his
acuteness
i
said
do
you
see
an
appreciation
of
the
under
side
of
things
the
side
that
does
not
lie
on
the
surface
are
you
serious
he
asked
as
i
leaned
back
to
rest
from
my
toil
perfectly
but
i
can
hardly
believe
that
you
are
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
really
see
anything
in
that
definition
i
do
i
said
with
ominous
distinctness
my
manner
indicated
his
stupidity
and
he
resented
it
he
grew
excited
now
tell
me
on
your
honor
do
you
really
see
anything
funnier
in
the
under
side
of
that
sofa
than
in
the
top
side
i
could
have
screamed
with
anguish
but
being
in
company
i
only
smote
my
hands
together
in
my
impotence
and
prayed
for
death
the
tension
was
relieved
by
the
young
son
of
our
hostess
in
the
library
just
beyond
having
overheard
our
conversation
he
laid
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
went
into
such
convulsions
of
silent
laughter
all
the
time
writhing
and
twisting
his
lean
body
into
such
contortions
that
in
watching
his
extraordinary
gymnastics
over
the
head
of
my
unconscious
and
wondering
if
the
boy
ever
could
untie
himself
i
forgot
my
suffering
i
even
relaxed
my
mental
strain
and
forgot
the
stupid
man
would
i
could
keep
on
forgetting
him
the
new
woman
you
have
taught
me
to
be
in
love
with
noble
thoughts
that
clever
to
say
is
talking
about
him
is
a
eulogy
to
say
one
is
talking
about
her
is
an
elegy
is
no
longer
true
more
the
pity
more
the
pity
i
mean
because
such
a
delicious
bit
deserves
a
longer
life
i
could
weep
over
the
early
death
of
an
epigram
with
a
hearty
spirit
which
is
second
only
to
the
grief
i
feel
at
a
good
story
spoiled
for
relation
sake
cleverness
like
beauty
is
its
own
excuse
for
being
and
the
first
attribute
of
the
new
woman
is
her
cleverness
it
is
the
new
woman
who
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
that
epigram
but
as
she
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
the
murder
but
was
only
an
accessory
after
the
fact
let
us
hope
that
she
will
escape
with
as
light
a
sentence
as
possible
from
that
stern
old
judge
public
opinion
who
is
not
her
friend
the
newspapers
have
ridiculed
the
new
woman
to
such
an
extent
and
their
ridicule
is
so
popular
that
it
requires
an
act
of
physical
courage
to
stand
up
in
her
defence
and
to
tell
the
public
that
the
bloomer
girl
is
not
new
that
they
have
had
the
newspaper
creation
like
the
poor
with
them
always
that
they
have
passed
over
the
real
new
woman
without
a
second
glance
in
other
words
to
assure
them
as
delicately
as
possible
that
they
have
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
the
first
thing
which
endears
the
new
woman
to
me
personally
more
even
than
her
cleverness
is
that
she
has
a
sense
of
humor
you
may
deny
that
if
you
want
to
i
firmly
believe
it
but
i
am
not
infallible
thank
heaven
that
i
am
not
i
abominate
those
people
who
are
always
right
you
ca
amuse
yourself
by
picking
flaws
in
them
they
are
so
irritatingly
conclusive
now
i
am
never
conclusive
and
you
ought
to
be
glad
of
it
it
makes
it
so
much
pleasanter
for
you
to
be
able
to
disagree
with
me
logically
why
have
men
always
possessed
an
exclusive
right
to
the
sense
of
humor
i
believe
it
is
because
they
live
more
humor
is
an
virtue
it
requires
ozone
and
the
light
of
the
sun
and
when
the
new
woman
came
to
live
and
mingled
with
men
and
newer
women
she
saw
funny
things
and
her
sense
of
humor
began
to
grow
and
thrive
the
fun
of
the
situation
is
entirely
lost
if
you
stay
at
home
too
much
now
do
let
the
supersensitive
men
who
always
want
women
to
pursue
the
perfectly
employment
of
knitting
gray
socks
do
let
them
have
a
fit
right
here
for
fear
women
have
come
to
stay
and
are
never
going
again
even
women
my
dear
sirs
know
enough
to
go
in
when
it
rains
they
love
a
quite
as
well
as
a
cat
does
a
cat
and
a
woman
always
come
home
to
the
but
there
is
very
little
mental
exhilaration
in
a
lots
of
comfort
but
little
humor
the
real
excitement
of
life
at
least
to
a
cat
is
when
in
a
morning
stroll
abroad
she
goes
out
of
her
sphere
the
and
meets
some
feline
friend
to
whom
she
extends
a
claw
playful
or
otherwise
or
possibly
meets
some
merry
puppy
which
induces
her
to
move
rapidly
up
the
nearest
tree
with
an
agility
which
you
never
would
believe
the
mother
of
a
family
could
boast
if
you
had
not
been
an
to
the
interesting
scene
such
an
encounter
will
not
induce
her
to
want
to
stay
up
a
tree
it
only
makes
the
safety
of
the
more
inviting
now
if
she
always
remained
on
the
how
could
we
tell
should
the
be
invaded
in
the
absence
of
her
natural
protectors
that
she
could
defend
herself
for
my
part
i
am
glad
to
know
when
i
leave
her
that
she
is
not
so
helpless
or
so
sleepy
as
she
looks
it
is
a
great
thing
to
know
that
a
cat
abilities
are
not
hopelessly
dormant
it
does
not
make
her
purr
the
less
when
she
is
stroked
her
fur
is
as
soft
her
ways
are
as
gentle
as
they
ever
were
and
as
she
lies
there
so
quietly
upon
the
she
looks
as
though
she
never
had
left
it
only
once
in
a
while
she
regards
you
out
of
one
eye
in
a
companionable
way
as
who
should
say
that
all
right
you
know
i
climb
a
tree
when
occasion
requires
the
dear
new
woman
i
like
her
perhaps
she
is
crude
in
her
newness
give
her
time
perhaps
she
makes
a
little
too
much
of
her
freedom
how
do
you
know
what
she
suffered
before
she
became
new
perhaps
she
has
her
faults
are
you
perfect
of
course
there
is
the
woman
who
shrieks
on
political
platforms
and
neglects
her
husband
and
lets
her
children
grow
up
like
little
ruffians
the
woman
who
wears
bloomers
and
bends
over
her
like
a
monkey
on
a
stick
the
woman
who
wants
to
hold
office
with
men
and
smoke
and
talk
like
men
alas
that
there
that
variety
of
woman
but
she
is
not
new
pray
did
you
never
see
her
before
she
wore
bloomers
bloomers
are
no
worse
than
the
sort
of
clothes
she
used
to
wear
her
swagger
is
no
more
pronounced
now
than
it
used
to
be
in
skirts
she
has
always
had
bloomer
instincts
you
do
pretend
to
declare
do
you
that
there
never
were
unconventional
women
and
rowdy
women
before
the
new
woman
was
heard
of
that
is
the
great
mistake
you
make
these
women
are
new
women
always
had
them
we
never
unfortunately
have
been
without
them
the
real
new
woman
is
a
creature
quite
different
she
is
one
whom
you
would
wish
to
know
she
is
one
whom
you
would
invite
to
your
most
select
dinners
you
would
be
better
men
if
you
had
more
friends
like
her
and
women
if
you
dropped
a
few
of
those
who
hand
you
doughnut
recipes
over
the
back
fence
and
who
entertain
you
with
the
history
of
the
baby
measles
and
how
they
are
managing
to
meet
the
payments
on
their
little
house
i
am
not
unsympathetic
either
with
the
measles
or
the
payments
but
i
prefer
the
subjects
of
conversation
which
a
new
woman
selects
there
is
more
ozone
in
them
the
new
woman
whom
i
mean
is
she
is
nearly
always
pretty
she
is
always
clever
she
is
always
a
lady
and
she
is
always
good
perhaps
to
the
cynical
that
combination
sounds
as
if
she
might
not
be
interesting
but
she
is
of
course
not
always
one
may
have
all
those
gifts
and
yet
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
them
for
other
people
benefit
the
gift
of
being
interesting
is
a
distinct
one
by
itself
but
the
new
woman
having
fresh
and
outside
interests
is
generally
able
to
talk
of
them
delightfully
the
new
woman
is
new
only
in
the
sense
that
she
has
opened
her
eyes
and
has
begun
to
see
the
value
of
the
simple
common
everyday
truths
which
lie
nearest
to
her
the
whole
world
becomes
new
to
those
who
suddenly
awake
to
the
beauties
which
they
never
had
thought
of
before
once
women
taught
their
daughters
housekeeping
and
sewing
from
stern
principle
and
made
it
neither
beautiful
nor
attractive
then
went
out
of
fashion
boys
married
trivial
girls
and
began
to
make
a
home
without
the
first
gleam
of
knowledge
as
to
how
the
thing
should
be
done
the
foolish
little
wife
knew
not
how
to
cook
or
sew
the
foolish
little
husband
said
he
was
glad
of
it
he
did
want
his
wife
to
wear
herself
out
in
the
kitchen
servants
could
do
such
things
so
they
hired
servants
more
ignorant
than
themselves
and
the
last
state
of
that
man
was
worse
than
the
first
children
came
to
them
that
was
the
most
pitiful
part
of
all
a
house
may
be
badly
managed
and
ignorantly
cared
for
and
people
do
not
die
of
it
or
become
warped
or
crippled
but
the
soul
of
a
child
to
say
nothing
of
the
helpless
little
body
can
be
ruined
utterly
through
the
irresponsibility
of
the
criminally
ignorant
people
to
whom
the
poor
little
thing
is
sent
their
ignorance
is
so
dense
and
that
they
never
know
that
they
are
ignorant
but
back
of
it
all
there
is
a
reason
a
bigoted
senseless
false
and
misnamed
delicacy
mothers
reared
their
daughters
and
sent
them
to
fulfil
their
mission
in
life
of
being
wives
and
mothers
versed
in
everything
except
the
two
things
they
were
destined
to
be
it
was
as
if
a
physician
were
taught
architecture
music
and
painting
and
then
sent
out
to
practise
his
unskill
in
medicine
upon
a
helpless
humanity
then
the
new
woman
opened
her
eyes
she
read
those
sturdy
words
which
are
much
quoted
but
which
never
can
be
repeated
too
often
the
situation
which
has
not
its
duty
its
ideals
was
never
yet
occupied
by
man
yes
here
in
this
poor
miserable
hampered
despicable
actual
wherein
thou
even
now
standest
here
or
nowhere
is
thy
ideal
work
it
out
therefrom
and
working
live
be
free
fool
the
ideal
is
in
thyself
thy
condition
is
but
the
stuff
thou
art
to
shape
this
same
ideal
out
of
what
matters
whether
such
stuff
be
of
this
sort
or
that
so
the
form
thou
give
it
be
heroic
be
poetic
oh
thou
that
pinest
in
the
imprisonment
of
the
actual
and
criest
bitterly
to
the
gods
for
a
kingdom
wherein
to
rule
and
create
know
this
of
a
truth
the
thing
thou
seekest
is
already
with
thee
or
nowhere
couldst
thou
only
see
it
read
like
when
applied
to
other
women
it
read
like
a
revelation
when
applied
to
herself
she
thought
what
her
mission
was
to
make
a
home
to
be
a
good
wife
to
understand
and
teach
little
children
and
where
do
you
find
the
new
woman
now
in
the
kindergarten
colleges
in
university
settlements
attending
mothers
meetings
teaching
ignorant
mothers
how
to
understand
the
tender
souls
and
delicate
bodies
of
the
dear
little
creatures
committed
to
their
loving
but
unwise
care
you
find
them
well
prepared
by
a
course
of
study
to
accept
the
responsibilities
of
life
when
their
time
comes
is
trivial
is
a
subject
to
sneer
at
or
to
jest
about
rather
it
is
the
hope
of
the
nation
legislation
can
not
satisfactorily
restrict
immigration
laws
do
not
forbid
the
criminal
from
marrying
and
the
insane
from
being
born
all
the
masculine
wisdom
in
the
world
can
not
prevent
the
state
from
annually
paying
millions
of
dollars
for
the
support
of
those
who
are
foredoomed
through
generations
of
ignorance
and
crime
crime
which
too
often
comes
only
from
ignorance
to
fill
your
jails
and
asylums
who
is
doing
anything
to
remedy
the
men
who
is
doing
anything
to
the
women
the
new
woman
the
sneered
at
the
ridiculed
and
abused
caricatured
by
the
cartoonist
derided
by
the
press
is
going
quietly
to
work
with
with
free
kindergartens
in
tenement
districts
with
college
settlements
to
begin
with
the
care
of
mothers
and
children
that
is
just
one
of
the
things
the
new
woman
is
doing
is
she
a
poor
creature
is
she
wearing
bloomers
is
she
masculine
or
unwomanly
rather
she
possesses
attributes
almost
divine
in
that
she
strikes
at
the
very
root
of
the
matter
and
begins
a
course
of
action
which
if
carried
out
will
do
what
all
the
men
in
creation
can
never
cure
she
will
prevent
the
new
woman
is
young
the
new
woman
is
oftener
a
pretty
girl
than
otherwise
they
are
not
poor
girls
either
who
are
doing
these
things
they
are
not
obliged
to
earn
their
daily
bread
they
are
the
daughters
of
the
rich
they
are
the
travelled
cultured
delicately
reared
girls
they
are
such
girls
as
two
generations
ago
would
have
disdained
anything
but
accomplishments
who
were
only
charitable
with
their
money
and
who
never
dreamed
of
giving
their
own
time
to
such
work
they
were
girls
who
considered
their
education
finished
when
they
left
school
i
glory
in
the
new
woman
in
that
so
often
she
rich
and
beautiful
it
is
easy
enough
to
be
good
if
you
are
plain
in
fact
there
is
nothing
else
left
for
a
plain
woman
but
take
these
lovely
girls
who
are
tempted
by
society
to
idle
away
their
days
and
waste
their
lives
listening
to
a
flattery
which
may
be
but
a
thing
of
the
moment
and
let
them
have
sense
to
see
through
its
hollowness
and
want
to
be
something
and
do
something
and
it
becomes
heroic
perhaps
it
is
only
a
fad
then
heaven
send
more
fads
if
it
is
the
fashion
to
have
a
vocation
and
to
educate
one
self
along
these
lines
which
never
were
heard
of
a
few
years
ago
then
for
once
fashion
has
accidentally
become
noble
it
strikes
me
rather
that
the
reign
of
has
begun
that
the
age
of
utility
has
come
when
nine
out
of
every
ten
of
the
girls
you
meet
in
smart
society
have
a
distinct
vocation
of
their
own
when
a
girl
who
only
sings
or
plays
or
crochets
is
considered
by
her
to
be
a
butterfly
when
society
girls
are
being
trained
nurses
when
if
you
are
paying
calls
upon
a
fashionable
friend
you
are
quite
apt
to
be
told
that
she
is
living
at
hull
house
this
month
when
a
girl
whose
face
generally
appears
in
the
society
column
suddenly
comes
out
as
the
composer
of
a
new
song
when
a
girl
who
dances
best
at
balls
calmly
announces
that
she
is
taking
a
course
at
the
university
when
everything
nowadays
is
gone
into
so
seriously
the
time
has
come
to
look
the
question
of
the
new
woman
squarely
in
the
face
to
put
a
stop
to
cheap
witticisms
at
her
expense
and
to
give
her
your
honest
respect
the
new
woman
has
attacked
the
problem
of
how
to
live
not
how
to
live
for
show
not
how
to
veneer
successfully
but
how
to
get
the
most
good
out
of
life
she
is
not
simply
endeavoring
to
kill
time
as
she
once
was
she
is
trying
to
live
each
day
for
itself
she
is
not
living
so
much
in
the
which
never
come
having
begun
to
earn
her
own
money
she
is
learning
the
value
of
her
father
a
thing
the
american
father
has
been
trying
to
teach
her
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
but
she
could
not
learn
because
she
saw
it
come
so
easily
and
she
let
it
go
so
freely
a
man
said
to
me
not
long
ago
what
has
got
into
the
girls
has
it
become
the
fashion
to
economize
all
the
nicest
girls
i
know
are
talking
of
the
value
of
money
and
of
how
much
is
wasted
unthinkingly
are
we
poor
bachelors
to
take
courage
and
believe
that
we
can
afford
one
of
these
beautiful
luxuries
in
wives
alas
it
is
anything
but
a
hint
to
take
courage
for
this
heavenly
phase
of
the
new
woman
means
that
when
she
has
learned
that
she
can
support
herself
so
that
in
case
her
riches
take
wings
she
need
not
be
forced
to
drudge
at
uncongenial
employment
or
to
marry
for
a
home
she
will
be
more
particular
than
ever
in
the
kind
of
a
man
she
marries
for
in
fitting
herself
for
marriage
she
is
learning
quite
as
well
the
kind
of
husband
she
ought
to
have
and
she
will
not
be
as
apt
to
marry
a
man
on
account
of
his
clothes
or
because
he
dances
divinely
as
once
she
might
have
done
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
new
woman
will
not
marry
in
point
of
fact
she
will
if
properly
urged
by
the
right
man
but
she
will
not
marry
so
early
so
hurriedly
nor
so
as
before
and
therefore
the
men
whom
new
women
marry
will
do
well
to
realize
the
compliment
of
her
choice
for
it
will
mean
that
according
to
her
light
he
has
been
weighed
in
the
balance
and
not
found
wanting
of
course
the
other
women
marry
on
that
principle
too
the
only
difference
between
the
new
woman
and
her
sisters
is
in
the
amount
of
her
light
and
the
use
she
makes
of
it
it
is
the
man
who
marries
the
new
woman
who
is
going
to
get
the
most
out
of
this
life
for
even
in
living
there
is
everything
in
knowing
how
and
far
from
leaving
man
out
of
her
problem
in
life
her
philosophy
is
teaching
her
to
look
for
his
possibilities
with
the
same
anxiety
that
she
employs
in
studying
her
own
that
to
adapt
herself
to
his
individuality
need
not
necessarily
imperil
her
own
that
the
first
element
in
the
forming
of
this
perfect
home
which
it
is
her
ambition
to
establish
is
perfect
congeniality
of
spirit
between
herself
and
her
husband
it
is
as
if
the
new
woman
were
striving
by
making
the
best
of
her
present
environments
and
simply
developing
her
woman
nature
instead
of
struggling
to
usurp
man
to
enunciate
a
philosophy
of
life
which
i
shall
so
dignify
homely
duties
and
beautify
the
commonplace
that
her
creed
might
well
be
we
shall
pass
through
this
world
but
once
if
there
be
any
kindness
we
can
show
or
any
good
thing
we
can
do
to
any
let
us
do
it
now
let
us
not
defer
nor
neglect
it
for
we
shall
not
pass
this
way
again
the
end
