beatrix
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
katharine
prescott
wormeley
note
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
that
balzac
dealing
as
he
did
with
traits
of
character
and
the
minute
and
daily
circumstances
of
life
has
never
been
accused
of
representing
actual
persons
in
the
two
or
three
thousand
portraits
which
he
painted
of
human
nature
in
the
great
man
of
the
provinces
in
paris
some
likenesses
were
imagined
jules
janin
in
etienne
lousteau
armand
carrel
in
michel
chrestien
and
possibly
berryer
in
daniel
d
arthez
but
in
the
present
volume
beatrix
he
used
the
characteristics
of
certain
persons
which
were
recognized
and
admitted
at
the
time
of
publication
mademoiselle
des
touches
camille
maupin
is
george
sand
in
character
and
the
personal
description
of
her
though
applied
by
some
to
the
famous
mademoiselle
georges
is
easily
recognized
from
couture
s
drawing
beatrix
conti
and
claude
vignon
are
sketches
of
the
comtesse
d
agoult
liszt
and
the
critic
gustave
planche
the
opening
scene
of
this
volume
representing
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
old
breton
family
a
social
state
existing
no
longer
except
in
history
and
the
transition
period
of
the
as
it
passed
into
the
customs
and
ideas
of
the
present
century
is
one
of
balzac
s
remarkable
and
most
famous
pictures
in
the
comedy
of
human
beatrix
i
a
breton
town
and
mansion
france
especially
in
brittany
still
possesses
certain
towns
completely
outside
of
the
movement
which
gives
to
the
nineteenth
century
its
peculiar
characteristics
for
lack
of
quick
and
regular
communication
with
paris
scarcely
connected
by
wretched
roads
with
the
or
the
chief
city
of
their
own
province
these
towns
regard
the
new
civilization
as
a
spectacle
to
be
gazed
at
it
amazes
them
but
they
never
applaud
it
and
whether
they
fear
or
scoff
at
it
they
continue
faithful
to
the
old
manners
and
customs
which
have
come
down
to
them
whoso
would
travel
as
a
moral
archaeologist
observing
men
instead
of
stones
would
find
images
of
the
time
of
louis
xv
in
many
a
village
of
provence
of
the
time
of
louis
xiv
in
the
depths
of
pitou
and
of
still
more
ancient
times
in
the
towns
of
brittany
most
of
these
towns
have
fallen
from
states
of
splendor
never
mentioned
by
historians
who
are
always
more
concerned
with
facts
and
dates
than
with
the
truer
history
of
manners
and
customs
the
tradition
of
this
splendor
still
lives
in
the
memory
of
the
people
as
in
brittany
where
the
native
character
allows
no
forgetfulness
of
things
which
concern
its
own
land
many
of
these
towns
were
once
the
capitals
of
a
little
feudal
state
a
county
or
duchy
conquered
by
the
crown
or
divided
among
many
heirs
if
the
male
line
failed
disinherited
from
active
life
these
heads
became
arms
and
arms
deprived
of
nourishment
wither
and
barely
vegetate
for
the
last
thirty
years
however
these
pictures
of
ancient
times
are
beginning
to
fade
and
disappear
modern
industry
working
for
the
masses
goes
on
destroying
the
creations
of
ancient
art
the
works
of
which
were
once
as
personal
to
the
consumer
as
to
the
artisan
nowadays
we
have
we
no
longer
have
public
buildings
monuments
of
the
past
count
for
much
in
the
phenomena
of
retrospection
but
the
monuments
of
modern
industry
are
freestone
quarries
saltpetre
mines
cotton
factories
a
few
more
years
and
even
these
old
cities
will
be
transformed
and
seen
no
more
except
in
the
pages
of
this
iconography
one
of
the
towns
in
which
may
be
found
the
most
correct
likeness
of
the
feudal
ages
is
guerande
the
name
alone
awakens
a
thousand
memories
in
the
minds
of
painters
artists
thinkers
who
have
visited
the
slopes
on
which
this
splendid
jewel
of
feudality
lies
proudly
posed
to
command
the
flux
and
reflux
of
the
tides
and
the
dunes
the
summit
as
it
were
of
a
triangle
at
the
corners
of
which
are
two
other
jewels
not
less
curious
croisic
and
the
village
of
batz
there
are
no
towns
after
guerande
except
vitre
in
the
centre
of
brittany
and
avignon
in
the
south
of
france
which
preserve
so
intact
to
the
very
middle
of
our
epoch
the
type
and
form
of
the
middle
ages
guerande
is
still
encircled
with
its
doughty
walls
its
moats
are
full
of
water
its
battlements
entire
its
loopholes
unencumbered
with
vegetation
even
ivy
has
never
cast
its
mantle
over
the
towers
square
or
round
the
town
has
three
gates
where
may
be
seen
the
rings
of
the
portcullises
it
is
entered
by
a
drawbridge
of
wood
no
longer
raised
but
which
could
be
raised
at
will
the
mayoralty
was
blamed
for
having
in
planted
poplars
along
the
banks
of
the
moat
to
shade
the
promenade
it
excused
itself
on
the
ground
that
the
long
and
beautiful
esplanade
of
the
fortifications
facing
the
dunes
had
been
converted
one
hundred
years
earlier
into
a
mall
where
the
inhabitants
took
their
pleasure
beneath
the
elms
the
houses
of
the
old
town
have
suffered
no
change
and
they
have
neither
increased
nor
diminished
none
have
suffered
upon
their
frontage
from
the
hammer
of
the
architect
the
brush
of
the
plasterer
nor
have
they
staggered
under
the
weight
of
added
stories
all
retain
their
primitive
characteristics
some
rest
on
wooden
columns
which
form
arcades
under
which
circulate
the
floor
planks
bending
beneath
them
but
never
breaking
the
houses
of
the
merchants
are
small
and
low
their
fronts
are
veneered
with
slate
wood
now
decaying
counts
for
much
in
the
carved
material
of
the
and
the
pillars
above
which
grotesque
faces
look
down
while
shapes
of
fantastic
beasts
climb
up
the
angles
animated
by
that
great
thought
of
art
which
in
those
old
days
gave
life
to
inanimate
nature
these
relics
resisting
change
present
to
the
eye
of
painters
those
dusky
tones
and
features
in
which
the
artistic
brush
delights
the
streets
are
what
they
were
four
hundred
years
ago
with
one
exception
population
no
longer
swarms
there
the
social
movement
is
now
so
dead
that
a
traveller
wishing
to
examine
the
town
as
beautiful
as
a
suit
of
antique
armor
may
walk
alone
not
without
sadness
through
a
deserted
street
where
the
mullioned
windows
are
plastered
up
to
avoid
the
this
street
ends
at
a
postern
flanked
with
a
wall
of
masonry
beyond
which
rises
a
bouquet
of
trees
planted
by
the
hands
of
breton
nature
one
of
the
most
luxuriant
and
fertile
vegetations
in
france
a
painter
a
poet
would
sit
there
silently
to
taste
the
quietude
which
reigns
beneath
the
arch
of
the
postern
where
no
voice
comes
from
the
life
of
the
peaceful
city
and
where
the
landscape
is
seen
in
its
rich
magnificence
through
the
of
the
casemates
once
occupied
by
halberdiers
and
archers
which
are
not
unlike
the
sashes
of
some
belvedere
arranged
for
a
point
of
view
it
is
impossible
to
walk
about
the
place
without
thinking
at
every
step
of
the
habits
and
usages
of
times
the
very
stones
tell
of
them
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
are
still
there
with
all
their
ancient
superstitions
if
by
chance
a
gendarme
passes
you
with
his
hat
his
presence
is
an
anachronism
against
which
your
sense
of
fitness
protests
but
nothing
is
so
rare
as
to
meet
a
being
or
an
object
of
the
present
time
there
is
even
very
little
of
the
clothing
of
the
day
and
that
little
the
inhabitants
adapt
in
a
way
to
their
immutable
customs
their
unchangeable
physiognomies
the
public
square
is
filled
with
breton
costumes
which
artists
flock
to
draw
these
stand
out
in
wonderful
relief
upon
the
scene
around
them
the
whiteness
of
the
linen
worn
by
the
the
name
given
to
men
who
gather
salt
in
the
contrasts
vigorously
with
the
blues
and
browns
of
the
peasantry
and
the
original
and
sacredly
preserved
jewelry
of
the
women
these
two
classes
and
that
of
the
sailors
in
their
jerkins
and
varnished
leather
caps
are
as
distinct
from
one
another
as
the
castes
of
india
and
still
recognize
the
distance
that
parts
them
from
the
bourgeoisie
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
all
lines
are
clearly
marked
there
the
revolutionary
level
found
the
masses
too
rugged
and
too
hard
to
plane
its
instrument
would
have
been
notched
if
not
broken
the
character
of
immutability
which
science
gives
to
zoological
species
is
found
in
breton
human
nature
even
now
after
the
revolution
of
guerande
is
still
a
town
apart
essentially
breton
fervently
catholic
silent
a
place
where
modern
ideas
have
little
access
its
geographical
position
explains
this
phenomenon
the
pretty
town
overlooks
a
the
product
of
which
is
called
throughout
brittany
the
guerande
salt
to
which
many
bretons
attribute
the
excellence
of
their
butter
and
their
sardines
it
is
connected
with
the
rest
of
france
by
two
roads
only
that
coming
from
savenay
the
arrondissement
to
which
it
belongs
which
stops
at
and
a
second
road
leading
from
vannes
which
connects
it
with
the
morbihan
the
arrondissement
road
establishes
communication
by
land
and
from
by
water
with
nantes
the
land
road
is
used
only
by
government
the
more
rapid
and
more
frequented
way
being
by
water
from
now
between
this
village
and
guerande
is
a
distance
of
eighteen
miles
which
the
does
not
serve
and
for
good
reason
not
three
coach
passengers
a
year
would
pass
over
it
these
and
other
obstacles
little
fitted
to
encourage
travellers
still
exist
in
the
first
place
government
is
slow
in
its
proceedings
and
next
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
put
up
readily
enough
with
difficulties
which
separate
them
from
the
rest
of
france
guerande
therefore
being
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
continent
leads
nowhere
and
no
one
comes
there
glad
to
be
ignored
she
thinks
and
cares
about
herself
only
the
immense
product
of
her
which
pays
a
tax
of
not
less
than
a
million
to
the
treasury
is
chiefly
managed
at
croisic
a
peninsular
village
which
communicates
with
guerande
over
quicksands
which
efface
during
the
night
the
tracks
made
by
day
and
also
by
boats
which
cross
the
arm
of
the
sea
that
makes
the
port
of
croisic
this
fascinating
little
town
is
therefore
the
herculaneum
of
feudality
less
its
winding
sheet
of
lava
it
is
afoot
but
not
living
it
has
no
other
ground
of
existence
except
that
it
has
not
been
demolished
if
you
reach
guerande
from
croisic
after
crossing
a
dreary
landscape
of
you
will
experience
a
strong
sensation
at
sight
of
that
vast
fortification
which
is
still
as
good
as
ever
if
you
come
to
it
by
the
picturesqueness
of
its
position
and
the
naive
grace
of
its
environs
will
please
you
no
less
the
country
immediately
surrounding
it
is
ravishing
the
hedges
are
full
of
flowers
honeysuckles
roses
box
and
many
enchanting
plants
it
is
like
an
english
garden
designed
by
some
great
architect
this
rich
coy
nature
so
untrodden
with
all
the
grace
of
a
bunch
of
violets
or
a
lily
of
the
valley
in
the
glade
of
a
forest
is
framed
by
an
african
desert
banked
by
the
ocean
a
desert
without
a
tree
an
herb
a
bird
where
on
sunny
days
the
laboring
clothed
in
white
and
scattered
among
those
melancholy
swamps
where
the
salt
is
made
remind
us
of
arabs
in
their
burrows
thus
guerande
bears
no
resemblance
to
any
other
place
in
france
the
town
produces
somewhat
the
same
effect
upon
the
mind
as
a
upon
the
body
it
is
silent
as
venice
there
is
no
other
public
conveyance
than
the
springless
wagon
of
a
carrier
who
carries
travellers
merchandise
and
occasionally
letters
from
to
guerande
and
bernus
the
carrier
was
in
the
factotum
of
this
large
community
he
went
and
came
when
he
pleased
all
the
country
knew
him
and
he
did
the
errands
of
all
the
arrival
of
a
carriage
in
guerande
that
of
a
lady
or
some
invalid
going
to
croisic
for
thought
to
have
greater
virtue
among
those
rocks
than
at
boulogne
or
dieppe
is
still
an
immense
event
the
peasants
come
in
on
horseback
most
of
them
with
commodities
for
barter
in
sacks
they
are
induced
to
do
so
and
so
are
the
by
the
necessity
of
purchasing
the
jewels
distinctive
of
their
caste
which
are
given
to
all
breton
brides
and
the
white
linen
or
cloth
for
their
clothing
for
a
circuit
ten
miles
round
guerande
is
always
guerande
the
illustrious
town
where
the
famous
treaty
was
signed
in
the
key
of
the
coast
which
may
boast
not
less
than
the
village
of
batz
of
a
splendor
now
lost
in
the
night
of
time
the
jewels
linen
cloth
ribbon
and
hats
are
made
elsewhere
but
to
those
who
buy
them
they
are
from
guerande
and
nowhere
else
all
artists
and
even
certain
bourgeois
who
come
to
guerande
feel
as
they
do
at
venice
a
desire
soon
forgotten
to
end
their
days
amid
its
peace
and
silence
walking
in
fine
weather
along
the
beautiful
mall
which
surrounds
the
town
from
gate
to
gate
on
the
side
toward
the
sea
sometimes
the
image
of
this
town
arises
in
the
temple
of
memory
she
enters
crowned
with
her
towers
clasped
with
her
girdle
her
robe
floats
onward
the
golden
mantle
of
her
dunes
enfolds
her
the
fragrant
breath
of
her
briony
paths
filled
with
the
flowers
of
each
passing
season
exhales
at
every
step
she
fills
your
mind
she
calls
to
you
like
some
enchanting
woman
whom
you
have
met
in
other
climes
and
whose
presence
still
lingers
in
a
fold
of
your
heart
near
the
church
of
guerande
stands
a
mansion
which
is
to
the
town
what
the
town
is
to
the
region
an
exact
image
of
the
past
the
symbol
of
a
grand
thing
destroyed
a
poem
in
short
this
mansion
belongs
to
the
noblest
family
of
the
province
to
the
du
guaisnics
who
in
the
times
of
the
du
guesclins
were
as
superior
to
the
latter
in
antiquity
and
fortune
as
the
trojans
were
to
the
romans
the
guaisqlains
the
name
is
also
spelled
in
the
olden
time
du
glaicquin
from
which
comes
du
guesclin
issued
from
the
du
guaisnics
old
as
the
granite
of
brittany
the
guaisnics
are
neither
frenchmen
nor
gauls
they
are
bretons
or
to
be
more
exact
they
are
celts
formerly
they
must
have
been
druids
gathering
mistletoe
in
the
sacred
forests
and
sacrificing
men
upon
their
dolmens
useless
to
say
what
they
were
this
race
equal
to
the
rohans
without
having
deigned
to
make
themselves
princes
a
race
which
was
powerful
before
the
ancestors
of
hugues
capet
were
ever
heard
of
this
family
pure
of
all
alloy
possesses
two
thousand
francs
a
year
its
mansion
in
guerande
and
the
little
castle
of
guaisnic
all
the
lands
belonging
to
the
barony
of
guaisnic
the
first
in
brittany
are
pledged
to
farmers
and
bring
in
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
spite
of
ignorant
culture
the
du
gaisnics
remain
the
owners
of
these
lands
although
they
receive
none
of
the
revenues
for
the
reason
that
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
they
have
been
unable
to
pay
off
the
money
advanced
upon
them
they
are
in
the
position
of
the
crown
of
france
towards
its
tenants
of
before
the
year
where
and
when
could
the
barons
obtain
the
million
their
farmers
have
advanced
to
them
before
the
tenure
of
the
fiefs
subject
to
the
castle
of
guaisnic
was
still
worth
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
but
a
vote
of
the
national
assembly
suppressed
the
seigneurs
dues
levied
on
inheritance
in
such
a
situation
this
family
of
absolutely
no
account
in
france
and
which
would
be
a
subject
of
laughter
in
paris
were
it
known
there

the

full
of
breton
significances

of
which
will
be
found
explained
in
the
chouans
has
been
subjected
to
the
same
alteration
which
disfigures
that
of
du
guaisqlain
the
now
writes
the
name
as
do
the
rest
of
the
world
du
guenic
at
the
end
of
a
silent
damp
and
gloomy
lane
may
be
seen
the
arch
of
a
door
or
rather
gate
high
enough
and
wide
enough
to
admit
a
man
on
horseback
a
circumstance
which
proves
of
itself
that
when
this
building
was
erected
carriages
did
not
exist
the
arch
supported
by
two
jambs
is
of
granite
the
gate
of
oak
rugged
as
the
bark
of
the
tree
itself
is
studded
with
enormous
nails
placed
in
geometric
figures
the
arch
is
semicircular
on
it
are
carved
the
arms
of
the
guaisnics
as
and
clear
as
though
the
sculptor
had
just
laid
down
his
chisel
this
escutcheon
would
delight
a
lover
of
the
heraldic
art
by
a
simplicity
which
proves
the
pride
and
the
antiquity
of
the
family
it
is
as
it
was
in
the
days
when
the
crusaders
of
the
christian
world
invented
these
symbols
by
which
to
recognize
each
other
the
guaisnics
have
never
had
it
quartered
it
is
always
itself
like
that
of
the
house
of
france
which
connoisseurs
find
inescutcheoned
in
the
shields
of
many
of
the
old
families
here
it
is
such
as
you
may
see
it
still
at
guerande
gules
a
hand
proper
gonfaloned
ermine
with
a
sword
argent
in
pale
and
the
terrible
motto
fac
is
not
that
a
grand
and
noble
thing
the
circlet
of
a
baronial
coronet
surmounts
this
simple
escutcheon
the
vertical
lines
of
which
used
in
carving
to
represent
gules
are
clear
as
ever
the
artist
has
given
i
know
not
what
proud
chivalrous
turn
to
the
hand
with
what
vigor
it
holds
the
sword
which
served
but
recently
the
present
family
if
you
go
to
guerande
after
reading
this
history
you
can
not
fail
to
quiver
when
you
see
that
blazon
yes
the
most
confirmed
republican
would
be
moved
by
the
fidelity
the
nobleness
the
grandeur
hidden
in
the
depths
of
that
dark
lane
the
du
guaisnics
did
well
yesterday
and
they
are
ready
to
do
well
to
do
is
the
motto
of
chivalry
you
did
well
in
the
battle
was
the
praise
of
the
connetable
the
great
du
guesclin
who
drove
the
english
for
a
time
from
france
the
depth
of
this
carving
which
has
been
protected
from
the
weather
by
the
projecting
edges
of
the
arch
is
in
keeping
with
the
moral
depth
of
the
motto
in
the
soul
of
this
family
to
those
who
know
the
guaisnics
this
fact
is
touching
the
gate
when
open
gives
a
vista
into
a
somewhat
vast
on
the
right
of
which
are
the
stables
on
the
left
the
kitchen
and
offices
the
house
is
build
of
freestone
from
cellar
to
garret
the
facade
on
the
has
a
portico
with
a
double
range
of
steps
the
wall
of
which
is
covered
with
vestiges
of
carvings
now
effaced
by
time
but
in
which
the
eye
of
an
antiquary
can
still
make
out
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
mass
the
hand
bearing
the
sword
the
granite
steps
are
now
disjointed
grasses
have
forced
their
way
with
little
flowers
and
mosses
through
the
fissures
between
the
stones
which
centuries
have
displaced
without
however
lessening
their
solidity
the
door
of
the
house
must
have
had
a
charming
character
as
far
as
the
relics
of
the
old
designs
allow
us
to
judge
it
was
done
by
an
artist
of
the
great
venetian
school
of
the
thirteenth
century
here
is
a
mixture
still
visible
of
the
byzantine
and
the
saracenic
it
is
crowned
with
a
circular
pediment
now
wreathed
with
vegetation
a
bouquet
rose
brown
yellow
or
blue
according
to
the
season
the
door
of
oak
gives
entrance
to
a
noble
hall
at
the
end
of
which
is
another
door
opening
upon
another
portico
which
leads
to
the
garden
this
hall
is
marvellously
well
preserved
the
panelled
wainscot
about
three
feet
high
is
of
chestnut
a
magnificent
spanish
leather
with
figures
in
relief
the
gilding
now
peeled
off
or
reddened
covers
the
walls
the
ceiling
is
of
wooden
boards
artistically
joined
and
painted
and
gilded
the
gold
is
scarcely
noticeable
it
is
in
the
same
condition
as
that
of
the
cordova
leather
but
a
few
red
flowers
and
the
green
foliage
can
be
distinguished
perhaps
a
thorough
cleaning
might
bring
out
paintings
like
those
discovered
on
the
plank
ceilings
of
tristan
s
house
at
tours
if
so
it
would
prove
that
those
planks
were
placed

of

and
within
it
are
gigantic
andirons
in
of
precious
workmanship

could
hold

the
furniture
of
this
hall
is
wholly
of
oak

upon
it

of

this
tower
corresponds
in
the
design
of
the
facade
toward
the
with
another
tower
at
the
opposite
corner
in
which
is
a
spiral
staircase
leading
to
the

with
tapestries
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
style
and
the
orthography
of
the
inscription
on
the
banderols
beneath
each
figure
prove
their
age
but
being
as
they
are
in
the
naive
language
of
the
it
is
impossible
to
transcribe
them
here
these
tapestries
well
preserved
in
those
parts
where
light
has
scarcely
penetrated
are
framed
in
bands
of

black
as

with

its
condition
proves
that
the
family
has
lived
in
this
room
for
the
last
century
it
is
of
carved
stone
in
the
style
of
the
louis

period
and

with
a
mirror

side
with

design

square
table
with
solid

of
turned
wood
covered
with

table
supported

a
single
leg
made
in
the
shape
of
a
which
stands
before
a
window
looking
into
the
garden
is
a
lamp
of
an
odd
kind
this
lamp
has
a
common
glass
globe
about
the
size
of
an
ostrich
egg
which
is
fastened
into
a

a
glass

a
hole

wick
which
passes
through

sort
of
reed
of

are
mullioned
in
stone
with
hexagonal
leaded
panes
and
are
draped
by
curtains
with
heavy
valances
and
stout
cords
of
an
ancient
stuff
of
crimson
silk
with
gold
reflections
called
in
former
days
either
brocatelle
or
small
brocade
on
each
of
the
two
upper
stories
of
the
house
there
are
but
two
rooms
the
first
is
the
bedroom
of
the
head
of
the
family
the
second
is
that
of
the
children
guests
were
lodged
in
chambers
beneath
the
roof
the
servants
slept
above
the
kitchens
and
stables
the
pointed
roof
protected
with
lead
at
its
angles
and
edges
has
a
noble
pointed
window
on
each
side
one
looking
down
upon
the
the
other
on
the
garden
these
windows
rising
almost
to
the
level
of
the
roof
have
slender
delicate
casings
the
carvings
of
which
have
crumbled
under
the
salty
vapors
of
the
atmosphere
above
the
arch
of
each
window
with
its
crossbars
of
stone
still
grinds
as
it
turns
the
vane
of
a
noble
let
us
not
forget
a
precious
detail
full
of
naivete
which
will
be
of
value
in
the
eyes
of
an
archaeologist
the
tower
in
which
the
spiral
staircase
goes
up
is
placed
at
the
corner
of
a
great
gable
wall
in
which
there
is
no
window
the
staircase
comes
down
to
a
little
arched
door
opening
upon
a
gravelled
yard
which
separates
the
house
from
the
stables
this
tower
is
repeated
on
the
garden
side
by
another
of
five
sides
ending
in
a
cupola
in
which
is
a
instead
of
being
roofed
like
the
with
a
this
is
how
those
charming
architects
varied
the
symmetry
of
their
these
towers
are
connected
on
the
level
of
the
first
floor
by
a
stone
gallery
supported
by
what
we
must
call
brackets
each
ending
in
a
grotesque
human
head
this
gallery
has
a
balustrade
of
exquisite
workmanship
from
the
gable
above
depends
a
stone
dais
like
those
that
crown
the
statues
of
saints
at
the
portal
of
churches
can
you
not
see
a
woman
walking
in
the
morning
along
this
balcony
and
gazing
over
guerande
at
the
sunshine
where
it
gilds
the
sands
and
shimmers
on
the
breast
of
ocean
do
you
not
admire
that
gable
wall
flanked
at
its
angles
with
those
varied
towers
the
opposite
gable
of
the
guaisnic
mansion
adjoins
the
next
house
the
harmony
so
carefully
sought
by
the
architects
of
those
days
is
maintained
in
the
facade
looking
on
the
by
the
tower
which
communicates
between
the
and
the
kitchen
and
is
the
same
as
the
staircase
tower
except
that
it
stops
at
the
first
upper
story
and
its
summit
is
a
small
open
dome
beneath
which
stands
a
now
blackened
statue
of
saint
calyste
the
garden
is
magnificent
for
so
old
a
place
it
covers
half
an
acre
of
ground
its
walls
are
all
espaliered
and
the
space
within
is
divided
into
squares
for
vegetables
bordered
with
cordons
of
which
the
named
gasselin
takes
care
of
in
the
intervals
of
grooming
the
horses
at
the
farther
end
of
the
garden
is
a
grotto
with
a
seat
in
it
in
the
middle
a
the
paths
are
gravelled
the
facade
on
the
garden
side
has
no
towers
corresponding
to
those
on
the
but
a
slender
spiral
column
rises
from
the
ground
to
the
roof
which
must
in
former
days
have
borne
the
banner
of
the
family
for
at
its
summit
may
still
be
seen
an
iron
socket
from
which
a
few
weak
plants
are
straggling
this
detail
in
harmony
with
the
vestiges
of
sculpture
proves
to
a
practised
eye
that
the
mansion
was
built
by
a
venetian
architect
the
graceful
staff
is
like
a
signature
revealing
venice
chivalry
and
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
the
thirteenth
century
if
any
doubts
remained
on
this
point
a
feature
of
the
ornamentation
would
dissipate
them
the
trefoils
of
the
hotel
du
guaisnic
have
four
leaves
instead
of
three
this
difference
plainly
indicates
the
venetian
school
depraved
by
its
commerce
with
the
east
where
the
architects
careless
of
the
great
catholic
thought
give
four
leaves
to
clover
while
christian
art
is
faithful
to
the
trinity
in
this
respect
venetian
art
becomes
heretical
if
this
ancient
dwelling
attracts
your
imagination
you
may
perhaps
ask
yourself
why
such
miracles
of
art
are
not
renewed
in
the
present
day
because
mansions
are
sold
pulled
down
and
the
ground
they
stood
on
turned
into
streets
no
one
can
be
sure
that
the
next
generation
will
possess
the
paternal
dwelling
homes
are
no
more
than
inns
whereas
in
former
times
when
a
dwelling
was
built
men
worked
or
thought
they
worked
for
a
family
in
perpetuity
hence
the
grandeur
of
these
houses
faith
in
self
as
well
as
faith
in
god
did
prodigies
as
for
the
arrangement
of
the
upper
rooms
they
may
be
imagined
after
this
description
of
the
and
after
reading
an
account
of
the
manners
customs
and
physiognomy
of
the
family
for
the
last
fifty
years
the
du
guaisnics
have
received
their
friends
in
the
two
rooms
just
described
in
which
as
in
the
and
the
external
accessories
of
the
building
the
spirit
grace
and
candor
of
the
old
and
noble
brittany
still
survives
without
the
topography
and
description
of
the
town
and
without
this
minute
depicting
of
the
house
the
surprising
figures
of
the
family
might
be
less
understood
therefore
the
frames
have
preceded
the
portraits
every
one
is
aware
that
things
influence
beings
there
are
public
buildings
whose
effect
is
visible
upon
the
persons
living
in
their
neighborhood
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
be
irreligious
in
the
shadow
of
a
cathedral
like
that
of
bourges
when
the
soul
is
everywhere
reminded
of
its
destiny
by
surrounding
images
it
is
less
easy
to
fail
of
it
such
was
the
thought
of
our
immediate
grandfathers
abandoned
by
a
generation
which
was
soon
to
have
no
signs
and
no
distinctions
and
whose
manners
and
morals
were
to
change
every
decade
if
you
do
not
now
expect
to
find

the

he

on

defeated
and
almost
captured
he
returned
to
guerande
and
from

went
to
croisic
whence
he
crossed
to
ireland
faithful
to
the
ancient

utter
ignorance

whole
course

twenty

simply

a
season
at
nantes
during
his
stay
in
dublin
the
old
breton

his
fifty
years

with

marriage
returned
to
ireland
and
after
about
ten
months
at
the
beginning
of

his
wife
to
guerande
where
she
gave
him
calyste
on
the
very
day
that
louis

a
circumstance

now
a
man
of

his

republic
his
exile
the
perils
of
his
five
crossings
through
a
turbulent
sea
in
open
boats
had
weighed
upon
his
head
and
he
looked
a
hundred
therefore
at
no
period
had
the
chief
of
the
house
of
guenic
been
more
in
keeping
with
the
grandeur
of
their
dwelling
built
in
the
days
when
a
court
reigned
at
guerande
monsieur
du
guenic
was
a
tall
straight
wiry
lean
old
man
his
oval
face
was
lined
with
innumerable
wrinkles
which
formed
a
over
his
and
above
his
eyebrows
giving
to
his
face
a
resemblance
to
those
choice
old
men
whom
van
ostade
rembrandt
mieris
and
gerard
dow
so
loved
to
paint
in
pictures
which
need
a
microscope
to
be
fully
appreciated
his
countenance
might
be
said
to
be
sunken
out
of
sight
beneath
those
innumerable
wrinkles
produced
by
a
life
in
the
open
air
and
by
the
habit
of
watching
his
country
in
the
full
light
of
the
sun
from
the
rising
of
that
luminary
to
the
sinking
of
it
nevertheless
to
an
observer
enough
remained
of
the
imperishable
forms
of
the
human
face
which
appealed
to
the
soul
even
though
the
eye
could
see
no
more
than
a
lifeless
head
the
firm
outline
of
the
face
the
shape
of
the
brow
the
solemnity
of
the
lines
the
rigidity
of
the
nose
the
form
of
the
bony
structure
which
wounds
alone
had
slightly
altered
all
were
signs
of
intrepidity
without
calculation
faith
without
reserve
obedience
without
discussion
fidelity
without
compromise
love
without
inconstancy
in
him
the
breton
granite
was
made
man
the
baron
had
no
longer
any
teeth
his
lips
once
red
now
violet
and
backed
by
hard
gums
only
with
which
he
ate
the
bread
his
wife
took
care
to
soften
by
folding
it
daily
in
a
damp
napkin
drew
inward
to
the
mouth
with
a
sort
of
grin
which
gave
him
an
expression
both
threatening
and
proud
his
chin
seemed
to
seek
his
nose
but
in
that
nose
humped
in
the
middle
lay
the
signs
of
his
energy
and
his
breton
resistance
his
skin
marbled
with
red
blotches
appearing
through
his
wrinkles
showed
a
powerfully
sanguine
temperament
fitted
to
resist
fatigue
and
to
preserve
him
as
no
doubt
it
did
from
apoplexy
the
head
was
crowned
with
abundant
hair
as
white
as
silver
which
fell
in
curls
upon
his
shoulders
the
face
extinguished
as
we
have
said
in
part
lived
through
the
glitter
of
the
black
eyes
in
their
brown
orbits
casting
thence
the
last
flames
of
a
generous
and
loyal
soul
the
eyebrows
and
lashes
had
disappeared
the
skin
grown
hard
could
not
unwrinkle
the
difficulty
of
shaving
had
obliged
the
old
man
to
let
his
beard
grow
and
the
cut
of
it
was
an
artist
would
have
admired
beyond
all
else
in
this
old
lion
of
brittany
with
his
powerful
shoulders
and
vigorous
chest
the
splendid
hands
of
the
soldier
hands
like
those
du
guesclin
must
have
had
large
broad
hairy
hands
that
once
had
clasped
the
sword
never
like
joan
of
arc
to
relinquish
it
until
the
royal
standard
floated
in
the
cathedral
of
rheims
hands
that
were
often
bloody
from
the
thorns
and
furze
of
the
bocage
hands
which
had
pulled
an
oar
in
the
marais
to
surprise
the
blues
or
in
the
offing
to
signal
georges
the
hands
of
a
guerilla
a
cannoneer
a
common
solder
a
leader
hands
still
white
though
the
bourbons
of
the
elder
branch
were
again
in
exile
looking
at
those
hands
attentively
one
might
have
seen
some
recent
marks
attesting
the
fact
that
the
baron
had
recently
joined
madame
in
la
vendee
that
fact
may
be
admitted
these
hands
were
a
living
commentary
on
the
noble
motto
to
which
no
guenic
had
proved
recreant
his
forehead
attracted
attention
by
the
golden
tones
of
the
temples
contrasting
with
the
brown
tints
of
the
hard
and
narrow
brow
which
the
falling
off
of
the
hair
had
somewhat
broadened
giving
still
more
majesty
to
that
noble
ruin
the
countenance
a
little
material
perhaps
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
presented
like
all
the
breton
faces
grouped
about
the
baron
a
certain
savagery
a
stolid
calm
which
resembled
the
impassibility
of
the
huguenots
something
one
might
say
stupid
due
perhaps
to
the
utter
repose
which
follows
extreme
fatigue
in
which
the
animal
nature
alone
is
visible
thought
was
rare
it
seemed
to
be
an
effort
its
seat
was
in
the
heart
more
than
in
the
head
it
led
to
acts
rather
than
ideas
but
examining
that
grand
old
man
with
sustained
observation
one
could
penetrate
the
mystery
of
this
strange
contradiction
to
the
spirit
of
the
century
he
had
faiths
sentiments
inborn
so
to
speak
which
allowed
him
to
dispense
with
thought
his
duty
life
had
taught
him
institutions
and
religion
thought
for
him
he
reserved
his
mind
he
and
his
kind
for
action
not
dissipating
it
on
useless
things
which
occupied
the
minds
of
other
persons
he
drew
his
thought
from
his
heart
like
his
sword
from
its
scabbard
holding
it
aloft
in
his
ermined
hand
as
on
his
scutcheon
shining
with
sincerity
that
secret
once
penetrated
all
is
clear
we
can
comprehend
the
depth
of
convictions
that
are
not
thoughts
but
living
principles
clear
distinct
downright
and
as
immaculate
as
the
ermine
itself
we
understand
that
sale
made
to
his
sister
before
the
war
which
provided
for
all
and
faced
all
death
confiscation
exile
the
beauty
of
the
character
of
these
two
old
people
for
the
sister
lived
only
for
and
by
the
brother
can
not
be
understood
to
its
full
extent
by
the
right
of
the
selfish
morals
the
uncertain
aims
and
the
inconstancy
of
this
our
epoch
an
archangel
charged
with
the
duty
of
penetrating
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
their
hearts
could
not
have
found
one
thought
of
personal
interest
in
when
the
rector
of
guerande
suggested
to
the
baron
that
he
should
go
to
paris
and
claim
his
recompense
from
the
triumphant
bourbons
the
old
sister
so
saving
and
miserly
for
the
household
cried
out
oh
fy
does
my
brother
need
to
hold
out
his
hand
like
a
beggar
it
would
be
thought
i
served
a
king
from
interest
said
the
old
man
besides
it
is
for
him
to
remember
poor
king
he
must
be
weary
indeed
of
those
who
harass
him
if
he
gave
them
all
france
in
bits
they
still
would
this
loyal
servant
who
had
spent
his
life
and
means
on
louis
received
the
rank
of
colonel
the
cross
of
and
a
stipend
of
two
thousand
francs
a
year
the
king
did
remember
he
said
when
the
news
reached
him
no
one
undeceived
him
the
gift
was
really
made
by
the
duc
de
feltre
but
as
an
act
of
gratitude
to
the
king
the
baron
sustained
a
siege
at
guerande
against
the
forces
of
general
travot
he
refused
to
surrender
the
fortress
and
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
evacuate
it
he
escaped
into
the
woods
with
a
band
of
chouans
who
continued
armed
until
the
second
restoration
of
the
bourbons
guerande
still
treasures
the
memory
of
that
siege
we
must
admit
that
the
baron
du
guenic
was
illiterate
as
a
peasant
he
could
read
write
and
do
some
little
ciphering
he
knew
the
military
art
and
heraldry
but
excepting
always
his
he
had
not
read
three
volumes
in
the
course
of
his
life
his
clothing
which
is
not
an
insignificant
point
was
invariably
the
same
it
consisted
of
stout
shoes
ribbed
stockings
breeches
of
greenish
velveteen
a
cloth
waistcoat
and
a
loose
coat
with
a
collar
from
which
hung
the
cross
of
a
noble
serenity
now
reigned
upon
that
face
where
for
the
last
year
or
so
sleep
the
forerunner
of
death
seemed
to
be
preparing
him
for
rest
eternal
this
constant
somnolence
becoming
daily
more
and
more
frequent
did
not
alarm
either
his
wife
his
blind
sister
or
his
friends
whose
medical
knowledge
was
of
the
slightest
to
them
these
solemn
pauses
of
a
life
without
reproach
but
very
weary
were
naturally
explained
the
baron
had
done
his
duty
that
was
all
in
this
ancient
mansion
the
absorbing
interests
were
the
fortunes
of
the
dispossessed
elder
branch
the
future
of
the
exiled
bourbons
that
of
the
catholic
religion
the
influence
of
political
innovations
on
brittany
were
the
exclusive
topics
of
conversation
in
the
baron
s
family
there
was
but
one
personal
interest
mingled
with
these
most
absorbing
ones
the
attachment
of
all
for
the
only
son
for
calyste
the
heir
the
sole
hope
of
the
great
name
of
the
du
guenics
the
old
vendean
the
old
chouan
had
some
years
previously
a
return
of
his
own
youth
in
order
to
train
his
son
to
those
manly
exercises
which
were
proper
for
a
gentleman
liable
to
be
summoned
at
any
moment
to
take
arms
no
sooner
was
calyste
sixteen
years
of
age
than
his
father
accompanied
him
to
the
marshes
and
the
forest
teaching
him
through
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
the
rudiments
of
war
preaching
by
example
indifferent
to
fatigue
firm
in
his
saddle
sure
of
his
shot
whatever
the
game
might
be
deer
hare
or
a
bird
on
the
wing
intrepid
in
face
of
obstacles
bidding
his
son
follow
him
into
danger
as
though
he
had
ten
other
sons
to
take
calyste
s
place
so
when
the
duchesse
de
berry
landed
in
france
to
conquer
back
the
kingdom
for
her
son
the
father
judged
it
right
to
take
his
boy
to
join
her
and
put
in
practice
the
motto
of
their
ancestors
the
baron
started
in
the
dead
of
night
saying
no
word
to
his
wife
who
might
perhaps
have
weakened
him
taking
his
son
under
fire
as
if
to
a
fete
and
gasselin
his
only
vassal
who
followed
him
joyfully
the
three
men
of
the
family
were
absent
for
three
months
without
sending
news
of
their
whereabouts
to
the
baroness
who
never
read
the
quotidienne
without
trembling
from
line
to
line
nor
to
his
old
blind
sister
heroically
erect
whose
nerve
never
faltered
for
an
instance
as
she
heard
that
paper
read
the
three
guns
hanging
to
the
walls
had
therefore
seen
service
recently
the
baron
who
considered
the
enterprise
useless
left
the
region
before
the
affair
of
la
penissiere
or
the
house
of
guenic
would
probably
have
ended
in
that
hecatomb
when
on
a
stormy
night
after
parting
from
madame
the
father
son
and
servant
returned
to
the
house
in
guerande
they
took
their
friends
and
the
baroness
and
old
mademoiselle
du
guenic
by
surprise
although
the
latter
by
the
exercise
of
senses
with
which
the
blind
are
gifted
recognized
the
steps
of
the
three
men
in
the
little
lane
leading
to
the
house
the
baron
looked
round
upon
the
circle
of
his
anxious
friends
who
were
seated
beside
the
little
table
lighted
by
the
antique
lamp
and
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
while
gasselin
replaced
the
three
guns
and
the
sabres
in
their
places
these
words
of
feudal
simplicity
the
barons
did
not
all
do
their
then
having
kissed
his
wife
and
sister
he
sat
down
in
his
old
and
ordered
supper
to
be
brought
for
his
son
for
gasselin
and
for
himself
gasselin
had
thrown
himself
before
calyste
on
one
occasion
to
protect
him
and
received
the
cut
of
a
sabre
on
his
shoulder
but
so
simple
a
matter
did
it
seem
that
even
the
women
scarcely
thanked
him
the
baron
and
his
guests
uttered
neither
curses
nor
complaints
of
their
conquerors
such
silence
is
a
trait
of
breton
character
in
forty
years
no
one
ever
heard
a
word
of
contumely
from
the
baron
s
lips
about
his
adversaries
it
was
for
them
to
do
their
duty
as
he
did
his
this
utter
silence
is
the
surest
indication
of
an
unalterable
will
this
last
effort
the
flash
of
an
energy
now
waning
had
caused
the
present
weakness
and
somnolence
of
the
old
man
the
fresh
defeat
and
exile
of
the
bourbons
as
miraculously
driven
out
as
miraculously
were
to
him
a
source
of
bitter
sadness
about
six
o
clock
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
this
history
begins
the
baron
who
according
to
ancient
custom
had
finished
dining
by
four
o
clock
fell
asleep
as
usual
while
his
wife
was
reading
to
him
the
his
head
rested
against
the
back
of
the
which
stood
beside
the
fireplace
on
the
garden
side
near
this
gnarled
trunk
of
an
ancient
tree
and
in
front
of
the
fireplace
the
baroness
seated
on
one
of
the
antique
chairs
presented
the
type
of
those
adorable
women
who
exist
in
england
scotland
or
ireland
only
there
alone
are
born
those
creatures
with
golden
hair
the
curls
of
which
are
wound
by
the
hands
of
angels
for
the
light
of
heaven
seems
to
ripple
in
their
silken
spirals
swaying
to
the
breeze
fanny
o
brien
was
one
of
those
sylphs
strong
in
tenderness
invincible
under
misfortune
soft
as
the
music
of
her
voice
pure
as
the
azure
of
her
eyes
of
a
delicate
refined
beauty
blessed
with
a
skin
that
was
silken
to
the
touch
and
caressing
to
the
eye
which
neither
painter
s
brush
nor
written
word
can
picture
beautiful
still
at
years
of
age
many
a
man
would
have
thought
it
happiness
to
marry
her
as
she
looked
at
the
splendors
of
that
autumn
coloring
redundant
in
flowers
and
fruit
refreshed
and
refreshing
with
the
dews
of
heaven
the
baroness
held
the
paper
in
the
dimpled
hand
the
fingers
of
which
curved
slightly
backward
their
nails
cut
square
like
those
of
an
antique
statue
half
lying
without
or
affectation
in
her
chair
her
feet
stretched
out
to
warm
them
she
was
dressed
in
a
gown
of
black
velvet
for
the
weather
was
now
becoming
chilly
the
corsage
rising
to
the
throat
moulded
the
splendid
contour
of
the
shoulders
and
the
rich
bosom
which
the
suckling
of
her
son
had
not
deformed
her
hair
was
worn
in
after
the
english
fashion
down
her
cheeks
the
rest
was
simply
twisted
to
the
crown
of
her
head
and
held
there
with
a
comb
the
color
not
undecided
in
tone
as
other
blond
hair
sparkled
to
the
light
like
a
filagree
of
burnished
gold
the
baroness
always
braided
the
short
locks
curling
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
which
are
a
sign
of
race
this
tiny
braid
concealed
in
the
mass
of
hair
always
carefully
put
up
allowed
the
eye
to
follow
with
delight
the
undulating
line
by
which
her
neck
was
set
upon
her
shoulders
this
little
detail
will
show
the
care
which
she
gave
to
her
person
it
was
her
pride
to
rejoice
the
eyes
of
the
old
baron
what
a
charming
delicate
attention
when
you
see
a
woman
displaying
in
her
own
home
the
coquetry
which
most
women
spend
on
a
single
sentiment
believe
me
that
woman
is
as
noble
a
mother
as
she
is
a
wife
she
is
the
joy
and
the
flower
of
the
home
she
knows
her
obligations
as
a
woman
in
her
soul
in
her
tenderness
you
will
find
her
outward
graces
she
is
doing
good
in
secret
she
worships
she
adores
without
a
calculation
of
return
she
loves
her
fellows
as
she
loves
god
for
their
own
sakes
and
so
one
might
fancy
that
the
virgin
of
paradise
under
whose
care
she
lived
had
rewarded
the
chaste
girlhood
and
the
sacred
life
of
the
old
man
s
wife
by
surrounding
her
with
a
sort
of
halo
which
preserved
her
beauty
from
the
wrongs
of
time
the
alterations
of
that
beauty
plato
would
have
glorified
as
the
coming
of
new
graces
her
skin
so
once
had
taken
the
warm
and
pearly
tones
which
painters
adore
her
broad
and
finely
modelled
brow
caught
lovingly
the
light
which
played
on
its
polished
surface
her
eyes
of
a
turquoise
blue
shone
with
unequalled
sweetness
the
soft
lashes
and
the
slightly
sunken
temples
inspired
the
spectator
with
i
know
now
what
mute
melancholy
the
nose
which
was
aquiline
and
thin
recalled
the
royal
origin
of
the
woman
the
pure
lips
finely
cut
wore
happy
smiles
brought
there
by
inexhaustible
her
teeth
were
small
and
white
she
had
gained
of
late
a
slight
embonpoint
but
her
delicate
hips
and
slender
waist
were
none
the
worse
for
it
the
autumn
of
her
beauty
presented
a
few
perennial
flowers
of
her
springtide
among
the
richer
blooms
of
summer
her
arms
became
more
nobly
rounded
her
lustrous
skin
took
a
finer
grain
the
outlines
of
her
form
gained
plenitude
lastly
and
best
of
all
her
open
countenance
serene
and
slightly
rosy
the
purity
of
her
blue
eyes
that
a
look
too
eager
might
have
wounded
expressed
illimitable
sympathy
the
tenderness
of
angels
at
the
other
in
an
the
octogenarian
sister
like
in
all
points
save
clothes
to
her
brother
sat
listening
to
the
reading
of
the
newspaper
and
knitting
stockings
a
work
for
which
sight
is
needless
both
eyes
had
cataracts
but
she
obstinately
refused
to
submit
to
an
operation
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
her
the
secret
reason
of
that
obstinacy
was
known
to
herself
only
she
declared
it
was
want
of
courage
but
the
truth
was
that
she
would
not
let
her
brother
spend
louis
for
her
benefit
that
sum
would
have
been
so
much
the
less
for
the
good
of
the
household
these
two
old
persons
brought
out
in
fine
relief
the
beauty
of
the
baroness
mademoiselle
zephirine
being
deprived
of
sight
was
not
aware
of
the
changes
which
eighty
years
had
wrought
in
her
features
her
pale
hollow
face
to
which
the
fixedness
of
the
white
and
sightless
eyes
gave
almost
the
appearance
of
death
and
three
or
four
solitary
and
projecting
teeth
made
menacing
was
framed
by
a
little
hood
of
brown
printed
cotton
quilted
like
a
petticoat
trimmed
with
a
cotton
ruche
and
tied
beneath
the
chin
by
strings
which
were
always
a
little
rusty
she
wore
a
or
short
skirt
of
coarse
cloth
over
a
quilted
petticoat
a
positive
mattress
in
which
were
secreted
double
ors
and
pockets
sewn
to
a
belt
which
she
unfastened
every
night
and
put
on
every
morning
like
a
garment
her
body
was
encased
in
the
of
brittany
a
species
of
spencer
made
of
the
same
cloth
as
the
adorned
with
a
collarette
of
many
pleats
the
washing
of
which
caused
the
only
dispute
she
ever
had
with
her
her
habit
being
to
change
it
only
once
a
week
from
the
large
wadded
sleeves
of
the
issued
two
withered
but
still
vigorous
arms
at
the
ends
of
which
flourished
her
hands
their
color
making
the
white
arms
look
like
these
hands
hooked
or
contracted
from
the
habit
of
knitting
might
be
called
a
incessantly
at
work
the
phenomenon
would
have
been
had
they
stopped
from
time
to
time
mademoiselle
du
guenic
took
a
long
knitting
needle
which
she
kept
in
the
bosom
of
her
gown
and
passed
it
between
her
hood
and
her
hair
to
poke
or
scratch
her
white
locks
a
stranger
would
have
laughed
to
see
the
careless
manner
in
which
she
thrust
back
the
needle
without
the
slightest
fear
of
wounding
herself
she
was
straight
as
a
steeple
her
erect
and
imposing
carriage
might
pass
for
one
of
those
coquetries
of
old
age
which
prove
that
pride
is
a
necessary
passion
of
life
her
smile
was
gay
she
too
had
done
her
duty
as
soon
as
the
baroness
saw
that
her
husband
was
asleep
she
stopped
reading
a
ray
of
sunshine
stretching
from
one
window
to
the
other
divided
by
a
golden
band
the
atmosphere
of
that
old
room
and
burnished
the
now
black
furniture
the
light
touched
the
carvings
of
the
ceiling
danced
on
the
chests
spread
its
shining
cloth
on
the
old
oak
table
enlivening
the
still
brown
room
as
fanny
s
voice
cast
into
the
heart
of
her
octogenarian
blind
sister
a
music
as
luminous
and
as
cheerful
as
that
ray
of
sunlight
soon
the
ray
took
on
the
ruddy
colors
which
by
insensible
gradations
sank
into
the
melancholy
tones
of
twilight
the
baroness
also
sank
into
a
deep
meditation
one
of
those
total
silences
which
her
had
noticed
for
the
last
two
weeks
trying
to
explain
them
to
herself
but
making
no
inquiry
the
old
woman
studied
the
causes
of
this
unusual
as
blind
persons
on
whose
soul
sound
lingers
like
a
divining
echo
read
books
in
which
the
pages
are
black
and
the
letters
white
mademoiselle
zephirine
to
whom
the
dark
hour
now
meant
nothing
continued
to
knit
and
the
silence
at
last
became
so
deep
that
the
clicking
of
her
was
plainly
heard
you
have
dropped
the
paper
sister
but
you
are
not
asleep
said
the
old
woman
slyly
at
this
moment
mariotte
came
in
to
light
the
lamp
which
she
placed
on
a
square
table
in
front
of
the
fire
then
she
fetched
her
distaff
her
ball
of
thread
and
a
small
stool
on
which
she
seated
herself
in
the
recess
of
a
window
and
began
as
usual
to
spin
gasselin
was
still
busy
about
the
offices
he
looked
to
the
horses
of
the
baron
and
calyste
saw
that
the
stable
was
in
order
for
the
night
and
gave
the
two
fine
their
daily
meal
the
joyful
barking
of
the
animals
was
the
last
noise
that
awakened
the
echoes
slumbering
among
the
darksome
walls
of
the
ancient
house
the
two
dogs
and
the
two
horses
were
the
only
remaining
vestiges
of
the
splendors
of
its
chivalry
an
imaginative
man
seated
on
the
steps
of
the
portico
and
letting
himself
fall
into
the
poesy
of
the
still
living
images
of
that
dwelling
might
have
quivered
as
he
heard
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
the
trampling
of
the
neighing
horses
gasselin
was
one
of
those
short
thick
squat
little
bretons
with
black
hair
and
faces
silent
slow
and
obstinate
as
mules
but
always
following
steadily
the
path
marked
out
for
them
he
was
years
old
and
had
been
years
in
the
household
mademoiselle
had
hired
him
when
he
was
fifteen
on
hearing
of
the
marriage
and
probable
return
of
the
baron
this
retainer
considered
himself
as
part
of
the
family
he
had
played
with
calyste
he
loved
the
horses
and
dogs
of
the
house
and
talked
to
them
and
petted
them
as
though
they
were
his
own
he
wore
a
blue
linen
jacket
with
little
pockets
flapping
about
his
hips
waistcoat
and
trousers
of
the
same
material
at
all
seasons
blue
stockings
and
stout
shoes
when
it
was
cold
or
rainy
he
put
on
a
goat
after
the
fashion
of
his
country
mariotte
who
was
also
over
forty
was
as
a
woman
what
gasselin
was
as
a
man
no
team
could
be
better
matched
same
complexion
same
figure
same
little
eyes
that
were
lively
and
black
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
gasselin
and
mariotte
had
never
married
possibly
it
might
have
seemed
immoral
they
were
so
like
brother
and
sister
mariotte
s
wages
were
ninety
francs
a
year
gasselin
s
three
hundred
but
thousands
of
francs
offered
to
them
elsewhere
would
not
have
induced
either
to
leave
the
guenic
household
both
were
under
the
orders
of
mademoiselle
who
from
the
time
of
the
war
in
la
vendee
to
the
period
of
her
brother
s
return
had
ruled
the
house
when
she
learned
that
the
baron
was
about
to
bring
home
a
mistress
she
had
been
moved
to
great
emotion
believing
that
she
must
yield
the
sceptre
of
the
household
and
abdicate
in
favor
of
the
baronne
du
guenic
whose
subject
she
was
now
compelled
to
be
mademoiselle
zephirine
was
therefore
agreeably
surprised
to
find
in
fanny
o
brien
a
young
woman
born
to
the
highest
rank
to
whom
the
petty
cares
of
a
poor
household
were
extremely
distasteful
one
who
like
other
fine
souls
would
far
have
preferred
to
eat
plain
bread
rather
than
the
choicest
food
if
she
had
to
prepare
it
for
herself
a
woman
capable
of
accomplishing
all
the
duties
even
the
most
painful
of
humanity
strong
under
necessary
privations
but
without
courage
for
commonplace
avocations
when
the
baron
begged
his
sister
in
his
wife
s
name
to
continue
in
charge
of
the
household
the
old
maid
kissed
the
baroness
like
a
sister
she
made
a
daughter
of
her
she
adored
her
overjoyed
to
be
left
in
control
of
the
household
which
she
managed
rigorously
on
a
system
of
almost
inconceivable
economy
which
was
never
relaxed
except
for
some
great
occasion
such
as
the
of
her
sister
and
her
nourishment
and
all
that
concerned
calyste
the
worshipped
son
of
the
whole
household
though
the
two
servants
were
accustomed
to
this
stern
regime
and
no
orders
need
ever
have
been
given
to
them
for
the
interests
of
their
masters
were
greater
in
their
minds
than
their
own
their
own
in
fact
mademoiselle
zephirine
insisted
on
looking
after
everything
her
attention
being
never
distracted
she
knew
without
going
up
to
verify
her
knowledge
how
large
was
the
heap
of
nuts
in
the
barn
and
how
many
oats
remained
in
the
bin
without
plunging
her
sinewy
arm
into
the
depths
of
it
she
carried
at
the
end
of
a
string
fastened
to
the
belt
of
her
a
boatswain
s
whistle
with
which
she
was
wont
to
summon
mariotte
by
one
and
gasselin
by
two
notes
gasselin
s
greatest
happiness
was
to
cultivate
the
garden
and
produce
fine
fruits
and
vegetables
he
had
so
little
work
to
do
that
without
this
occupation
he
would
certainly
have
felt
lost
after
he
had
groomed
his
horses
in
the
morning
he
polished
the
floors
and
cleaned
the
rooms
on
the
then
he
went
to
his
garden
where
weed
or
damaging
insect
was
never
seen
sometimes
gasselin
was
observed
motionless
under
a
burning
sun
watching
for
a
or
the
terrible
grub
of
the
cockchafer
then
as
soon
as
it
was
caught
he
would
rush
with
the
joy
of
a
child
to
show
his
masters
the
noxious
beast
that
had
occupied
his
mind
for
a
week
he
took
pleasure
in
going
to
croisic
on
to
purchase
a
fish
to
be
had
for
less
money
there
than
at
guerande
thus
no
household
was
ever
more
truly
one
more
united
in
interests
more
bound
together
than
this
noble
family
sacredly
devoted
to
its
duty
masters
and
servants
seemed
made
for
one
another
for
years
there
had
been
neither
trouble
nor
discord
the
only
griefs
were
the
petty
ailments
of
the
little
boy
the
only
terrors
were
caused
by
the
events
of
and
those
of
if
the
same
things
were
invariably
done
at
the
same
hours
if
the
food
was
subjected
to
the
regularity
of
times
and
seasons
this
monotony
like
that
of
nature
varied
only
by
alterations
of
cloud
and
rain
and
sunshine
was
sustained
by
the
affection
existing
in
the
hearts
of
all
the
more
fruitful
the
more
beneficent
because
it
emanated
from
natural
causes
iii
three
breton
silhouettes
when
night
had
fairly
fallen
gasselin
came
into
the
hall
and
asked
his
master
respectfully
if
he
had
further
need
of
him
you
can
go
out
or
go
to
bed
after
prayers
replied
the
baron
waking
up
unless
madame
or
my
sister
the
two
ladies
here
made
a
sign
of
consent
gasselin
then
knelt
down
seeing
that
his
masters
rose
to
kneel
upon
their
chairs
mariotte
also
knelt
before
her
stool
mademoiselle
du
guenic
then
said
the
prayer
aloud
after
it
was
over
some
one
rapped
at
the
door
on
the
lane
gasselin
went
to
open
it
i
dare
say
it
is
monsieur
le
cure
he
usually
comes
first
said
mariotte
every
one
now
recognized
the
rector
s
foot
on
the
resounding
steps
of
the
portico
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
three
occupants
of
the
room
and
addressed
them
in
phrases
of
that
unctuous
civility
which
priests
are
accustomed
to
use
to
the
rather
greeting
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
he
replied
by
an
ecclesiastically
inquisitive
look
are
you
anxious
or
ill
madame
la
baronne
he
asked
thank
you
no
she
replied
monsieur
grimont
a
man
of
fifty
of
middle
height
lost
in
his
cassock
from
which
issued
two
stout
shoes
with
silver
buckles
exhibited
above
his
hands
a
plump
visage
and
a
generally
white
skin
though
yellow
in
spots
his
hands
were
dimpled
his
abbatial
face
had
something
of
the
dutch
burgomaster
in
the
placidity
of
its
complexion
and
its
flesh
tones
and
of
the
breton
peasant
in
the
straight
black
hair
and
the
vivacity
of
the
brown
eyes
which
preserved
nevertheless
a
priestly
decorum
his
gaiety
that
of
a
man
whose
conscience
was
calm
and
pure
admitted
a
joke
his
manner
had
nothing
uneasy
or
dogged
about
it
like
that
of
many
poor
rectors
whose
existence
or
whose
power
is
contested
by
their
parishioners
and
who
instead
of
being
as
napoleon
sublimely
said
the
moral
leaders
of
the
population
and
the
natural
justices
of
peace
are
treated
as
enemies
observing
monsieur
grimont
as
he
marched
through
guerande
the
most
irreligious
of
travellers
would
have
recognized
the
sovereign
of
that
catholic
town
but
this
same
sovereign
lowered
his
spiritual
superiority
before
the
feudal
supremacy
of
the
du
guenics
in
their
salon
he
was
as
a
chaplain
in
his
seigneur
s
house
in
church
when
he
gave
the
benediction
his
hand
was
always
first
stretched
out
toward
the
chapel
belonging
to
the
guenics
where
their
mailed
hand
and
their
device
were
carved
upon
the
of
the
arch
i
thought
that
mademoiselle
de
had
already
arrived
said
the
rector
sitting
down
and
taking
the
hand
of
the
baroness
to
kiss
it
she
is
getting
unpunctual
can
it
be
that
the
fashion
of
dissipation
is
contagious
i
see
that
monsieur
le
chevalier
is
again
at
les
touches
this
don
t
say
anything
about
those
visits
before
mademoiselle
de
cried
the
old
maid
eagerly
ah
mademoiselle
remarked
mariotte
you
can
t
prevent
the
town
from
what
do
they
say
asked
the
baroness
the
young
girls
and
the
old
women
all
say
that
he
is
in
love
with
mademoiselle
des
a
lad
of
calyste
s
make
is
playing
his
proper
part
in
making
the
women
love
him
said
the
baron
here
comes
mademoiselle
de
said
mariotte
the
gravel
in
the
crackled
under
the
discreet
footsteps
of
the
coming
lady
who
was
accompanied
by
a
page
supplied
with
a
lantern
seeing
this
lad
mariotte
removed
her
stool
to
the
great
hall
for
the
purpose
of
talking
with
him
by
the
gleam
of
his
which
was
burned
at
the
cost
of
his
rich
and
miserly
mistress
thus
economizing
those
of
her
own
masters
this
elderly
demoiselle
was
a
thin
old
maid
yellow
as
the
parchment
of
a
parliament
record
wrinkled
as
a
lake
ruffled
by
the
wind
with
gray
eyes
large
prominent
teeth
and
the
hands
of
a
man
she
was
rather
short
a
little
crooked
possibly
but
no
one
had
ever
been
inquisitive
enough
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
her
perfections
or
her
imperfections
dressed
in
the
same
style
as
mademoiselle
du
guenic
she
stirred
an
enormous
quantity
of
petticoats
and
linen
whenever
she
wanted
to
find
one
or
other
of
the
two
apertures
of
her
gown
through
which
she
reached
her
pockets
the
strangest
jingling
of
keys
and
money
then
echoed
among
her
garments
she
always
wore
dangling
from
one
side
the
bunch
of
keys
of
a
good
housekeeper
and
from
the
other
her
silver
thimble
and
other
implements
that
were
also
resonant
instead
of
mademoiselle
zephirine
s
wadded
hood
she
wore
a
green
bonnet
in
which
she
may
have
visited
her
melons
for
it
had
passed
like
them
from
green
to
yellowish
as
for
its
shape
our
present
fashions
are
just
now
bringing
it
back
to
paris
after
twenty
years
absence
under
the
name
of
bibi
this
bonnet
was
constructed
under
her
own
eye
and
by
the
hands
of
her
nieces
out
of
green
florence
silk
bought
at
guerande
and
an
old
renewed
every
five
years
at
nantes
for
mademoiselle
de
allowed
her
bonnets
the
longevity
of
a
legislature
her
nieces
also
made
her
gowns
cut
by
an
immutable
pattern
the
old
lady
still
used
the
cane
with
the
short
hook
that
all
women
carried
in
the
early
days
of
she
belonged
to
the
very
highest
nobility
of
brittany
her
arms
bore
the
ermine
of
its
ancient
dukes
in

and
in
her
sister
the
illustrious
breton
house
of
the
ended
her
younger
sister
had
married
a
kergarouet
who
in
spite
of
the
deep
disapproval
of
the
whole
region
added
the
name
of
to
his
own
and
called
himself
the
vicomte

has
punished
him
said
the
old
lady
he
has
nothing
but
daughters
and
the
name

be
wiped
mademoiselle
de
possessed
about
seven
thousand
francs
a
year
from
the
rental
of
lands
she
had
come
into
her
property
at
years
of
age
and
managed
it
herself
inspecting
it
on
horseback
and
displaying
on
all
points
the
firmness
of
character
which
is
noticeable
in
most
deformed
persons
her
avarice
was
admired
by
the
whole
country
round
never
meeting
with
the
slightest
disapproval
she
kept
one
and
the
page
her
yearly
expenses
not
including
taxes
did
not
amount
to
over
a
thousand
francs
consequently
she
was
the
object
of
the
cajoleries
of
the
who
passed
the
winters
at
nantes
and
the
summers
at
their
estate
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
below
l
indret
she
was
supposed
to
be
ready
to
leave
her
fortune
and
her
savings
to
whichever
of
her
nieces
pleased
her
best
every
three
months
one
or
other
of
the
four
demoiselles
de
the
youngest
of
whom
was
twelve
and
the
eldest
twenty
years
of
age
came
to
spend
a
few
days
with
her
a
friend
of
zephirine
du
guenic
jacqueline
de
brought
up
to
adore
the
breton
grandeur
of
the
du
guenics
had
formed
ever
since
the
birth
of
calyste
the
plan
of
transmitting
her
property
to
the
chevalier
by
marrying
him
to
whichever
of
her
nieces
the
vicomtesse
de
their
mother
would
bestow
upon
him
she
dreamed
of
buying
back
some
of
the
best
of
the
guenic
property
from
the
farmer
when
avarice
has
an
object
it
ceases
to
be
a
vice
it
becomes
a
means
of
virtue
its
privations
are
a
perpetual
offering
it
has
the
grandeur
of
an
intention
beneath
its
meannesses
perhaps
zephirine
was
in
the
secret
of
jacqueline
s
intention
perhaps
even
the
baroness
whose
whole
soul
was
occupied
by
love
for
her
son
and
tenderness
for
his
father
may
have
guessed
it
as
she
saw
with
what
wily
perseverance
mademoiselle
de
brought
with
her
her
favorite
niece
charlotte
de
kergarouet
now
sixteen
years
of
age
the
rector
monsieur
grimont
was
certainly
in
her
confidence
it
was
he
who
helped
the
old
maid
to
invest
her
savings
but
mademoiselle
de
might
have
had
three
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
she
might
have
had
ten
times
the
landed
property
she
actually
possessed
and
the
du
guenics
would
never
have
allowed
themselves
to
pay
her
the
slightest
attention
that
the
old
woman
could
construe
as
looking
to
her
fortune
from
a
feeling
of
truly
breton
pride
jacqueline
de
glad
of
the
supremacy
accorded
to
her
old
friend
zephirine
and
the
du
guenics
always
showed
herself
honored
by
her
relations
with
madame
du
guenic
and
her
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
conceal
the
sort
of
sacrifice
to
which
she
consented
every
evening
in
allowing
her
page
to
burn
in
the
guenic
hall
that
singular
candle
called
an
which
is
still
used
in
certain
parts
of
western
france
thus
this
rich
old
maid
was
nobility
pride
and
grandeur
personified
at
the
moment
when
you
are
reading
this
portrait
of
her
the
abbe
grimont
has
just
indiscreetly
revealed
that
on
the
evening
when
the
old
baron
the
young
chevalier
and
gasselin
secretly
departed
to
join
madame
to
the
terror
of
the
baroness
and
the
great
joy
of
all
bretons
mademoiselle
de
had
given
the
baron
ten
thousand
francs
in
gold
an
immense
sacrifice
to
which
the
abbe
added
another
ten
thousand
a
tithe
collected
by
him
charging
the
old
hero
to
offer
the
whole
in
the
name
of
the
and
of
the
parish
of
guerande
to
the
mother
of
henri
mademoiselle
de
treated
calyste
as
if
she
felt
that
her
intentions
gave
her
certain
rights
over
him
her
plans
seemed
to
authorize
a
supervision
not
that
her
ideas
were
strict
in
the
matter
of
gallantry
for
she
had
in
fact
the
usual
indulgence
of
the
old
women
of
the
old
school
but
she
held
in
horror
the
modern
ways
of
revolutionary
morals
calyste
who
might
have
gained
in
her
estimation
by
a
few
adventures
with
breton
girls
would
have
lost
it
considerably
had
she
seen
him
entangled
in
what
she
called
innovations
she
might
have
disinterred
a
little
gold
to
pay
for
the
results
of
a
but
if
calyste
had
driven
a
tilbury
or
talked
of
a
visit
to
paris
she
would
have
thought
him
dissipated
and
declared
him
a
spendthrift
impossible
to
say
what
she
might
not
have
done
had
she
found
him
reading
novels
or
an
impious
newspaper
to
her
novel
ideas
meant
the
overthrow
of
succession
of
crops
ruin
under
the
name
of
improvements
and
methods
in
short
mortgaged
lands
as
the
inevitable
result
of
experiments
to
her
prudence
was
the
true
method
of
making
your
fortune
good
management
consisted
in
filling
your
granaries
with
wheat
rye
and
flax
and
waiting
for
a
rise
at
the
risk
of
being
called
a
monopolist
and
clinging
to
those
obstinately
by
singular
chance
she
had
often
made
lucky
sales
which
confirmed
her
principles
she
was
thought
to
be
maliciously
clever
but
in
fact
she
was
not
on
the
other
hand
being
as
methodical
as
a
dutchman
prudent
as
a
cat
and
persistent
as
a
priest
those
qualities
in
a
region
of
routine
like
brittany
were
practically
the
equivalent
of
intellect
will
monsieur
du
halga
join
us
this
evening
asked
mademoiselle
de
taking
off
her
knitted
mittens
after
the
usual
exchange
of
greetings
yes
mademoiselle
i
met
him
taking
his
dog
to
walk
on
the
mall
replied
the
rector
ha
then
our
will
be
lively
last
evening
we
were
only
at
the
word
the
rector
rose
and
took
from
a
drawer
in
one
of
the
tall
chests
a
small
round
basket
made
of
fine
osier
a
pile
of
ivory
counters
yellow
as
a
turkish
pipe
after
twenty
years
usage
and
a
pack
of
cards
as
greasy
as
those
of
the
officers
at
who
change
them
only
once
in
two
weeks
these
the
abbe
brought
to
the
table
arranging
the
proper
number
of
counters
before
each
player
and
putting
the
basket
in
the
centre
of
the
table
beside
the
lamp
with
infantine
eagerness
and
the
manner
of
a
man
accustomed
to
perform
this
little
service
a
knock
at
the
outer
gate
given
firmly
in
military
fashion
echoed
through
the
stillness
of
the
ancient
mansion
mademoiselle
de
s
page
went
gravely
to
open
the
door
and
presently
the
long
lean
person
of
the
chevalier
du
halga
former
to
admiral
de
kergarouet
defined
itself
in
black
on
the
penumbra
of
the
portico
welcome
chevalier
cried
mademoiselle
de
the
altar
is
raised
said
the
abbe
the
chevalier
was
a
man
in
poor
health
who
wore
flannel
for
his
rheumatism
a
to
protect
his
head
from
fog
and
a
spencer
to
guard
his
precious
chest
from
the
sudden
gusts
which
freshen
the
atmosphere
of
guerande
he
always
went
armed
with
a
cane
to
drive
away
the
dogs
who
paid
untimely
court
to
a
favorite
little
bitch
who
usually
accompanied
him
this
man
fussy
as
a
fine
lady
worried
by
the
slightest
speaking
low
to
spare
his
voice
had
been
in
his
early
days
one
of
the
most
intrepid
and
most
competent
officers
of
the
old
navy
he
had
won
the
confidence
of
de
suffren
in
the
indian
ocean
and
the
friendship
of
the
comte
de
portenduere
his
splendid
conduct
while
to
admiral
kergarouet
was
written
in
visible
letters
on
his
scarred
face
to
see
him
now
no
one
would
have
imagined
the
voice
that
ruled
the
storm
the
eye
that
compassed
the
sea
the
courage
indomitable
of
the
breton
sailor
the
chevalier
never
smoked
never
swore
he
was
gentle
and
tranquil
as
a
girl
as
much
concerned
about
his
little
dog
thisbe
and
her
caprices
as
though
he
were
an
elderly
dowager
in
this
way
he
gave
a
high
idea
of
his
departed
gallantry
but
he
never
so
much
as
alluded
to
the
deeds
of
surpassing
bravery
which
had
astonished
the
doughty
old
admiral
comte
d
estaing
though
his
manner
was
that
of
an
invalid
and
he
walked
as
if
stepping
on
eggs
and
complained
about
the
sharpness
of
the
wind
or
the
heat
of
the
sun
or
the
dampness
of
the
misty
atmosphere
he
exhibited
a
set
of
the
whitest
teeth
in
the
reddest
of
gums
a
fact
reassuring
as
to
his
maladies
which
were
however
rather
expensive
consisting
as
they
did
of
four
daily
meals
of
monastic
amplitude
his
bodily
frame
like
that
of
the
baron
was
bony
and
indestructibly
strong
and
covered
with
a
parchment
glued
to
his
bones
as
the
skin
of
an
arab
horse
on
the
muscles
which
shine
in
the
sun
his
skin
retained
the
tawny
color
it
received
in
india
whence
however
he
did
not
bring
back
either
facts
or
ideas
he
had
emigrated
with
the
rest
of
his
friends
lost
his
property
and
was
now
ending
his
days
with
the
cross
of
and
a
pension
of
two
thousand
francs
as
the
legal
reward
of
his
services
paid
from
the
fund
of
the
invalides
de
la
marine
the
slight
hypochondria
which
made
him
invent
his
imaginary
ills
is
easily
explained
by
his
actual
suffering
during
the
emigration
he
served
in
the
russian
navy
until
the
day
when
the
emperor
alexander
ordered
him
to
be
employed
against
france
he
then
resigned
and
went
to
live
at
odessa
near
the
duc
de
richelieu
with
whom
he
returned
to
france
it
was
the
duke
who
obtained
for
this
glorious
relic
of
the
old
breton
navy
the
pension
which
enabled
him
to
live
on
the
death
of
louis
xviii
he
returned
to
guerande
and
became
after
a
while
mayor
of
the
city
the
rector
the
chevalier
and
mademoiselle
de
had
regularly
passed
their
evenings
for
the
last
fifteen
years
at
the
hotel
de
guenic
where
the
other
noble
personages
of
the
neighborhood
also
came
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
the
du
guenics
were
at
the
head
of
the
faubourg
of
the
old
breton
province
where
no
member
of
the
new
administration
sent
down
by
the
government
was
ever
allowed
to
penetrate
for
the
last
six
years
the
rector
coughed
when
he
came
to
the
crucial
words
salvum
fac
politics
were
still
at
that
point
in
guerande
iv
a
normal
evening
is
a
game
played
with
five
cards
dealt
to
each
player
and
one
turned
over
the
card
is
trumps
at
each
round
the
player
is
at
liberty
to
run
his
chances
or
to
abstain
from
playing
his
card
if
he
abstains
he
loses
nothing
but
his
own
stake
for
as
long
as
there
are
no
forfeits
in
the
basket
each
player
puts
in
a
trifling
sum
if
he
plays
and
wins
a
trick
he
is
paid
to
the
stake
that
is
if
there
are
five
sous
in
the
basket
he
wins
one
sou
the
player
who
fails
to
win
a
trick
is
made
he
has
to
pay
the
whole
stake
which
swells
the
basket
for
the
next
game
those
who
decline
to
play
throw
down
their
cards
during
the
game
but
their
play
is
held
to
be
null
the
players
can
exchange
their
cards
with
the
remainder
of
the
pack
as
in
ecarte
but
only
by
order
of
sequence
so
that
the
first
and
second
players
may
and
sometimes
do
absorb
the
remainder
of
the
pack
between
them
the
trump
card
belongs
to
the
dealer
who
is
always
the
last
he
has
the
right
to
exchange
it
for
any
card
in
his
own
hand
one
powerful
card
is
of
more
importance
than
all
the
rest
it
is
called
mistigris
mistigris
is
the
knave
of
clubs
this
game
simple
as
it
is
is
not
lacking
in
interest
the
cupidity
natural
to
mankind
develops
in
it
so
does
diplomatic
wiliness
also
play
of
countenance
at
the
hotel
du
guenic
each
of
the
players
took
twenty
counters
representing
five
sous
which
made
the
sum
total
of
the
stake
for
each
game
five
farthings
a
large
amount
in
the
eyes
of
this
company
supposing
some
extraordinary
luck
fifty
sous
might
be
won
more
capital
than
any
person
in
guerande
spent
in
the
course
of
any
one
day
consequently
mademoiselle
de
put
into
this
game
the
innocence
of
which
is
only
surpassed
in
the
nomenclature
of
the
academy
by
that
of
la
bataille
a
passion
corresponding
to
that
of
the
hunters
after
big
game
mademoiselle
zephirine
who
went
shares
in
the
game
with
the
baroness
attached
no
less
importance
to
it
to
put
up
one
farthing
for
the
chance
of
winning
five
game
after
game
was
to
this
confirmed
hoarder
a
mighty
financial
operation
into
which
she
put
as
much
mental
action
as
the
most
eager
speculator
at
the
bourse
expends
during
the
rise
and
fall
of
consols
by
a
certain
diplomatic
convention
dating
from
september
when
mademoiselle
de
lost
sous
the
game
was
to
cease
as
soon
as
a
person
losing
ten
sous
should
express
the
wish
to
retire
politeness
did
not
allow
the
rest
to
give
the
retiring
player
the
pain
of
seeing
the
game
go
on
without
him
but
as
all
passions
have
their
jesuitism
the
chevalier
and
the
baron
those
wily
politicians
had
found
a
means
of
eluding
this
charter
when
all
the
players
but
one
were
anxious
to
continue
an
exciting
game
the
daring
sailor
du
halga
one
of
those
rich
fellows
prodigal
of
costs
they
do
not
pay
would
offer
ten
counters
to
mademoiselle
zephirine
or
mademoiselle
jacqueline
when
either
of
them
or
both
of
them
had
lost
their
five
sous
on
condition
of
reimbursement
in
case
they
won
an
old
bachelor
could
allow
himself
such
gallantries
to
the
sex
the
baron
also
offered
ten
counters
to
the
old
maids
but
under
the
honest
pretext
of
continuing
the
game
the
miserly
maidens
accepted
not
however
without
some
pressing
as
is
the
use
and
wont
of
maidens
but
before
giving
way
to
this
vast
prodigality
the
baron
and
the
chevalier
were
required
to
have
won
otherwise
the
offer
would
have
been
taken
as
an
insult
became
a
brilliant
affair
when
a
demoiselle
de
kergarouet
was
in
transit
with
her
aunt
we
use
the
single
name
for
the
kergarouets
had
never
been
able
to
induce
any
one
to
call
them
not
even
their
servants
although
the
latter
had
strict
orders
so
to
do
at
these
times
the
aunt
held
out
to
the
niece
as
a
signal
treat
the
at
the
du
guenics
the
girl
was
ordered
to
look
amiable
an
easy
thing
to
do
in
the
presence
of
the
beautiful
calyste
whom
the
four
kergarouet
young
ladies
all
adored
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
modern
civilization
these
young
persons
cared
little
for
five
sous
a
game
and
on
such
occasions
the
stakes
went
higher
those
were
evenings
of
great
emotion
to
the
old
blind
sister
the
baroness
would
give
her
sundry
hints
by
pressing
her
foot
a
certain
number
of
times
according
to
the
size
of
the
stake
it
was
safe
to
play
to
play
or
not
to
play
if
the
basket
were
full
involved
an
inward
struggle
where
cupidity
fought
with
fear
if
charlotte
de
kergarouet
who
was
usually
called
giddy
was
lucky
in
her
bold
throws
her
aunt
on
their
return
home
if
she
had
not
won
herself
would
be
cold
and
disapproving
and
lecture
the
girl
she
had
too
much
decision
in
her
character
a
young
person
should
never
assert
herself
in
presence
of
her
betters
her
manner
of
taking
the
basket
and
beginning
to
play
was
really
insolent
the
proper
behavior
of
a
young
girl
demanded
much
more
reserve
and
greater
modesty
etc
it
can
easily
be
imagined
that
these
games
carried
on
nightly
for
twenty
years
were
interrupted
now
and
then
by
narratives
of
events
in
the
town
or
by
discussions
on
public
events
sometimes
the
players
would
sit
for
half
an
hour
their
cards
held
on
their
stomachs
engaged
in
talking
if
as
a
result
of
these
inattentions
a
counter
was
missing
from
the
basket
every
one
eagerly
declared
that
he
or
she
had
put
in
their
proper
number
usually
the
chevalier
made
up
the
deficiency
being
accused
by
the
rest
of
thinking
so
much
of
his
buzzing
ears
his
chilly
chest
and
other
symptoms
of
invalidism
that
he
must
have
forgotten
his
stake
but
no
sooner
did
he
supply
the
missing
counter
than
zephirine
and
jacqueline
were
seized
with
remorse
they
imagined
that
possibly
they
themselves
had
forgotten
their
stake
they
believed
they
doubted
but
after
all
the
chevalier
was
rich
enough
to
bear
such
a
trifling
misfortune
these
dignified
and
noble
personages
had
the
delightful
pettiness
of
suspecting
each
other
mademoiselle
de
would
almost
invariably
accuse
the
rector
of
cheating
when
he
won
the
basket
it
is
singular
he
would
reply
that
i
never
cheat
except
when
i
win
the
often
the
baron
would
forget
where
he
was
when
the
talk
fell
on
the
misfortunes
of
the
royal
house
sometimes
the
evening
ended
in
a
manner
that
was
quite
unexpected
to
the
players
who
all
counted
on
a
certain
gain
after
a
certain
number
of
games
and
when
the
hour
grew
late
these
excellent
people
would
be
forced
to
separate
without
either
loss
or
gain
but
not
without
emotion
on
these
sad
evenings
complaints
were
made
of
itself
it
was
dull
it
was
long
the
players
accused
their
as
negroes
stone
the
moon
in
the
water
when
the
weather
is
bad
on
one
occasion
after
an
arrival
of
the
vicomte
and
vicomtesse
de
kergarouet
there
was
talk
of
whist
and
boston
being
games
of
more
interest
than
the
baroness
who
was
bored
by
encouraged
the
innovation
and
all
the
company
but
not
without
reluctance
adopted
it
but
it
proved
impossible
to
make
them
really
understand
the
new
games
which
on
the
departure
of
the
kergarouets
were
voted
algebraic
problems
and
intolerably
difficult
to
play
all
preferred
their
their
dear
agreeable
accordingly
triumphed
over
modern
games
as
all
ancient
things
have
ever
triumphed
in
brittany
over
novelties
while
the
rector
was
dealing
the
cards
the
baroness
was
asking
the
chevalier
du
halga
the
same
questions
which
she
had
asked
him
the
evening
before
about
his
health
the
chevalier
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
have
new
ailments
inquiries
might
be
alike
but
the
nautical
hero
had
singular
advantages
in
the
way
of
replies
it
chanced
that
his
ribs
troubled
him
but
here
s
a
remarkable
thing
never
did
the
worthy
chevalier
complain
of
his
wounds
the
ills
that
were
really
the
matter
with
him
he
expected
he
knew
them
and
he
bore
them
but
his
fancied
ailments
his
headaches
the
gnawings
in
his
stomach
the
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
a
thousand
other
fads
and
symptoms
made
him
horribly
uneasy
he
posed
as
incurable
and
not
without
reason
for
doctors
up
to
the
present
time
have
found
no
remedy
for
diseases
that
don
t
exist
yesterday
the
trouble
was
i
believe
in
your
legs
said
the
rector
it
moves
about
replied
the
chevalier
legs
to
ribs
asked
mademoiselle
zephirine
without
stopping
on
the
way
said
mademoiselle
de
smiling
the
chevalier
bowed
gravely
making
a
negative
gesture
which
was
not
a
little
droll
and
proved
to
an
observer
that
in
his
youth
the
sailor
had
been
witty
and
loving
and
beloved
perhaps
his
fossil
life
at
guerande
hid
many
memories
when
he
stood
solemnly
planted
on
his
two
in
the
sunshine
on
the
mall
gazing
at
the
sea
or
watching
the
gambols
of
his
little
dog
perhaps
he
was
living
again
in
some
terrestrial
paradise
of
a
past
that
was
rich
in
recollections
so
the
old
duc
de
lenoncourt
is
dead
said
the
baron
remembering
the
paragraph
of
the
quotidienne
where
his
wife
had
stopped
reading
well
the
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
followed
his
master
soon
i
shall
go
my
dear
my
dear
said
his
wife
gently
tapping
the
bony
calloused
hand
of
her
husband
let
him
say
what
he
likes
sister
said
zephirine
as
long
as
i
am
above
ground
he
can
t
be
under
it
i
am
the
a
gay
smile
played
on
the
old
woman
s
lips
whenever
the
baron
made
reflections
of
that
kind
the
players
and
the
visitors
present
looked
at
each
other
with
emotion
distressed
by
the
sadness
of
the
king
of
guerande
and
after
they
had
left
the
house
they
would
say
as
they
walked
home
monsieur
du
guenic
was
sad
did
you
notice
how
he
slept
and
the
next
day
the
whole
town
would
talk
of
the
matter
the
baron
du
guenic
fails
was
a
phrase
that
opened
the
conversation
in
many
houses
how
is
thisbe
asked
mademoiselle
de
of
the
chevalier
as
soon
as
the
cards
were
dealt
the
poor
little
thing
is
like
her
master
replied
the
chevalier
she
has
some
nervous
trouble
she
goes
on
three
legs
constantly
see
like
in
raising
and
crooking
his
arm
to
imitate
the
dog
the
chevalier
exposed
his
hand
to
his
cunning
neighbor
who
wanted
to
see
if
he
had
mistigris
or
the
trump
a
first
wile
to
which
he
succumbed
oh
said
the
baroness
the
end
of
monsieur
le
cure
s
nose
is
turning
white
he
has
the
pleasure
of
having
mistigris
was
so
great
to
the
rector
as
it
was
to
the
other
players
that
the
poor
priest
could
not
conceal
it
in
all
human
faces
there
is
a
spot
where
the
secret
emotions
of
the
heart
betray
themselves
and
these
companions
accustomed
for
years
to
observe
each
other
had
ended
by
finding
out
that
spot
on
the
rector
s
face
when
he
had
mistigris
the
tip
of
his
nose
grew
pale
you
had
company
said
the
chevalier
to
mademoiselle
de
yes
a
cousin
of
my
he
surprised
me
by
announcing
the
marriage
of
the
comtesse
de
kergarouet
a
demoiselle
de
the
daughter
of
cried
the
chevalier
who
had
lived
with
the
admiral
during
his
stay
in
paris
the
countess
is
his
heir
she
has
married
an
old
ambassador
my
visitor
told
me
the
strangest
things
about
our
neighbor
mademoiselle
des
touches
so
strange
that
i
can
t
believe
them
if
they
were
true
calyste
would
never
be
so
constantly
with
her
he
has
too
much
good
sense
not
to
perceive
such
monstrosities
monstrosities
said
the
baron
waked
up
by
the
word
the
baroness
and
the
rector
exchanged
looks
the
cards
were
dealt
mademoiselle
de
had
mistigris
impossible
to
continue
the
conversation
but
she
was
glad
to
hide
her
joy
under
the
excitement
caused
by
her
last
word
your
play
monsieur
le
baron
she
said
with
an
air
of
importance
my
nephew
is
not
one
of
those
youths
who
like
monstrosities
remarked
zephirine
taking
out
her
and
scratching
her
head
mistigris
cried
mademoiselle
de
making
no
reply
to
her
friend
the
rector
who
appeared
to
be
in
the
matter
of
calyste
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
did
not
enter
the
lists
what
does
she
do
that
is
so
extraordinary
mademoiselle
des
touches
asked
the
baron
she
smokes
replied
mademoiselle
de
that
s
very
wholesome
said
the
chevalier
about
her
property
asked
the
baron
her
property
continued
the
old
maid
oh
she
is
running
through
the
game
is
mine
said
the
baroness
see
i
have
king
queen
knave
of
trumps
mistigris
and
a
king
we
win
the
basket
this
victory
gained
at
one
stroke
without
playing
a
card
horrified
mademoiselle
de
who
ceased
to
concern
herself
about
calyste
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
by
nine
o
clock
no
one
remained
in
the
salon
but
the
baroness
and
the
rector
the
four
old
people
had
gone
to
their
beds
the
chevalier
according
to
his
usual
custom
accompanied
mademoiselle
de
to
her
house
in
the
place
de
guerande
making
remarks
as
they
went
along
on
the
cleverness
of
the
last
play
on
the
joy
with
which
mademoiselle
zephirine
engulfed
her
gains
in
those
capacious
pockets
of
hers
for
the
old
blind
woman
no
longer
repressed
upon
her
face
the
visible
signs
of
her
feelings
madame
du
guenic
s
evident
preoccupation
was
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
however
the
chevalier
had
remarked
the
abstraction
of
the
beautiful
irish
woman
when
they
reached
mademoiselle
de
s
and
her
page
had
gone
in
the
old
lady
answered
confidentially
the
remarks
of
the
chevalier
on
the
strangely
abstracted
air
of
the
baroness
i
know
the
cause
calyste
is
lost
unless
we
marry
him
promptly
he
loves
mademoiselle
des
touches
an
actress
in
that
case
send
for
i
have
sent
my
sister
will
receive
my
letter
replied
mademoiselle
de
bowing
to
the
chevalier
imagine
from
this
sketch
of
a
normal
evening
the
hubbub
excited
in
guerande
homes
by
the
arrival
the
stay
the
departure
or
even
the
mere
passage
through
the
town
of
a
stranger
when
no
sounds
echoed
from
the
baron
s
chamber
nor
from
that
of
his
sister
the
baroness
looked
at
the
rector
who
was
playing
pensively
with
the
counters
i
see
that
you
begin
to
share
my
anxiety
about
calyste
she
said
to
him
did
you
notice
mademoiselle
de
s
displeased
looks
asked
the
rector
yes
replied
the
baroness
she
has
as
i
know
the
best
intentions
about
our
dear
calyste
she
loves
him
as
though
he
were
her
son
his
conduct
in
vendee
beside
his
father
the
praises
that
madame
bestowed
upon
his
devotion
have
only
increased
her
affection
for
him
she
intends
to
execute
a
deed
of
gift
by
which
she
gives
her
whole
property
at
her
death
to
whichever
of
her
nieces
calyste
marries
i
know
that
you
have
another
and
much
richer
marriage
in
ireland
for
your
dear
calyste
but
it
is
well
to
have
two
strings
to
your
bow
in
case
your
family
will
not
take
charge
of
calyste
s
establishment
mademoiselle
de
s
fortune
is
not
to
be
despised
you
can
always
find
a
match
of
seven
thousand
francs
a
year
for
the
dear
boy
but
it
is
not
often
that
you
could
come
across
the
savings
of
forty
years
and
landed
property
as
well
managed
built
up
and
kept
in
repair
as
that
of
mademoiselle
de
that
ungodly
woman
mademoiselle
des
touches
has
come
here
to
ruin
many
excellent
things
her
life
is
now
and
what
is
it
asked
the
mother
oh
that
of
a
trollop
replied
the
rector
a
woman
of
questionable
morals
a
writer
for
the
stage
frequenting
theatres
and
actors
squandering
her
fortune
among
pamphleteers
painters
musicians
a
devilish
society
in
short
she
writes
books
herself
and
has
taken
a
false
name
by
which
she
is
better
known
they
tell
me
than
by
her
own
she
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
circus
woman
who
never
enters
a
church
except
to
look
at
the
pictures
she
has
spent
quite
a
fortune
in
decorating
les
touches
in
a
most
improper
fashion
making
it
a
mohammedan
paradise
where
the
houris
are
not
women
there
is
more
wine
drunk
there
they
say
during
the
few
weeks
of
her
stay
than
the
whole
year
round
in
guerande
the
demoiselles
bougniol
let
their
lodgings
last
year
to
men
with
beards
who
were
suspected
of
being
blues
they
sang
wicked
songs
which
made
those
virtuous
women
blush
and
weep
and
spent
their
time
mostly
at
les
touches
and
this
is
the
woman
our
dear
calyste
adores
if
that
creature
wanted
one
of
the
infamous
books
in
which
the
atheists
of
the
present
day
scoff
at
holy
things
calyste
would
saddle
his
horse
himself
and
gallop
to
nantes
for
it
i
am
not
sure
that
he
would
do
as
much
for
the
church
moreover
this
breton
woman
is
not
a
royalist
if
calyste
were
again
called
upon
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
cause
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
the
sieur
camille
maupin
that
is
her
other
name
as
i
have
just
remembered
if
she
wanted
to
keep
him
with
her
the
chevalier
would
let
his
old
father
go
to
the
field
without
oh
no
said
the
baroness
i
should
not
like
to
put
him
to
the
proof
you
would
suffer
too
much
replied
the
rector
all
guerande
is
turned
upside
down
about
calyste
s
passion
for
this
amphibious
creature
who
is
neither
man
nor
woman
who
smokes
like
an
hussar
writes
like
a
journalist
and
has
at
this
very
moment
in
her
house
the
most
venomous
of
all
writers
so
the
postmaster
says
and
he
s
a
man
who
reads
the
papers
they
are
even
talking
about
her
at
nantes
this
morning
the
kergarouet
cousin
who
wants
to
marry
charlotte
to
a
man
with
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
went
to
see
mademoiselle
de
and
filled
her
mind
with
tales
about
mademoiselle
des
touches
which
lasted
seven
hours
it
is
now
striking
a
quarter
to
ten
and
calyste
is
not
home
he
is
at
les
touches
perhaps
he
won
t
come
in
all
the
baroness
listened
to
the
rector
who
was
substituting
monologue
for
dialogue
unconsciously
as
he
looked
at
this
lamb
of
his
fold
on
whose
face
could
be
read
her
anxiety
she
colored
and
trembled
when
the
worthy
man
saw
the
tears
in
the
beautiful
eyes
of
the
mother
he
was
moved
to
compassion
i
will
see
mademoiselle
de
he
said
don
t
be
too
uneasy
the
harm
may
not
be
as
great
as
they
say
it
is
i
will
find
out
the
truth
mademoiselle
jacqueline
has
confidence
in
me
besides
calyste
is
our
child
our
pupil
he
will
never
let
the
devil
inveigle
him
neither
will
he
trouble
the
peace
of
his
family
or
destroy
the
plans
we
have
made
for
his
future
therefore
don
t
weep
all
is
not
lost
madame
one
fault
is
not
you
are
only
informing
me
of
details
said
the
baroness
was
not
i
the
first
to
notice
the
change
in
my
calyste
a
mother
keenly
feels
the
shock
of
finding
herself
second
in
the
heart
of
her
son
she
can
not
be
deceived
this
crisis
in
a
man
s
life
is
one
of
the
trials
of
motherhood
i
have
prepared
myself
for
it
but
i
did
not
think
it
would
come
so
soon
i
hoped
at
least
that
calyste
would
take
into
his
heart
some
noble
and
beautiful
being
not
a
a
masquerader
a
theatre
woman
an
author
whose
business
it
is
to
feign
sentiments
a
creature
who
will
deceive
him
and
make
him
unhappy
she
has
had
adventures
with
several
men
said
the
rector
and
yet
this
impious
creature
was
born
in
brittany
she
dishonors
her
land
i
shall
preach
a
sermon
upon
her
next
don
t
do
that
cried
the
baroness
the
peasants
and
the
would
be
capable
of
rushing
to
les
touches
calyste
is
worthy
of
his
name
he
is
breton
some
dreadful
thing
might
happen
to
him
for
he
would
surely
defend
her
as
he
would
the
blessed
it
is
now
ten
o
clock
i
must
bid
you
said
the
abbe
lighting
the
wick
of
his
lantern
the
glass
of
which
was
clear
and
the
metal
shining
which
testified
to
the
care
his
housekeeper
bestowed
on
the
household
property
who
could
ever
have
told
me
madame
he
added
that
a
young
man
brought
up
by
you
trained
by
me
to
christian
ideas
a
fervent
catholic
a
child
who
has
lived
as
a
lamb
without
spot
would
plunge
into
such
mire
but
is
it
certain
said
the
mother
how
could
any
woman
help
loving
calyste
what
other
proof
is
needed
than
her
staying
on
at
les
touches
in
all
the
years
since
she
came
of
age
she
has
never
stayed
there
so
long
as
now
her
visits
to
these
parts
happily
for
us
were
few
and
a
woman
over
forty
years
old
exclaimed
the
baroness
i
have
heard
say
in
ireland
that
a
woman
of
this
description
is
the
most
dangerous
mistress
a
young
man
can
as
to
that
i
have
no
knowledge
replied
the
rector
and
i
shall
die
in
my
and
i
too
alas
said
the
baroness
naively
i
wish
now
that
i
had
loved
with
love
so
as
to
understand
and
counsel
and
comfort
the
rector
did
not
cross
the
clean
little
alone
the
baroness
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
hoping
to
hear
calyste
s
step
coming
through
the
town
but
she
heard
nothing
except
the
heavy
tread
of
the
rector
s
cautious
feet
which
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
and
finally
ceased
when
the
closing
of
the
door
of
the
parsonage
echoed
behind
him
calyste
the
poor
mother
returned
to
the
salon
deeply
distressed
at
finding
that
the
whole
town
was
aware
of
what
she
had
thought
was
known
to
her
alone
she
sat
down
trimmed
the
wick
of
the
lamp
by
cutting
it
with
a
pair
of
old
scissors
took
up
once
more
the
she
was
doing
and
awaited
calyste
the
baroness
fondly
hoped
to
induce
her
son
by
this
means
to
come
home
earlier
and
spend
less
time
with
mademoiselle
des
touches
such
calculations
of
maternal
jealousy
were
wasted
day
after
day
calyste
s
visits
to
les
touches
became
more
frequent
and
every
night
he
came
in
later
the
night
before
the
day
of
which
we
speak
it
was
midnight
when
he
returned
the
baroness
lost
in
maternal
meditation
was
setting
her
stitches
with
the
rapidity
of
one
absorbed
in
thought
while
engaged
in
manual
labor
whoever
had
seen
her
bending
to
the
light
of
the
lamp
beneath
the
quadruply
centennial
hangings
of
that
ancient
room
would
have
admired
the
sublimity
of
the
picture
fanny
s
skin
was
so
transparent
that
it
was
possible
to
read
the
thoughts
that
crossed
her
brow
beneath
it
piqued
with
a
curiosity
that
often
comes
to
a
pure
woman
she
asked
herself
what
devilish
secrets
these
daughters
of
baal
possessed
to
so
charm
men
as
to
make
them
forgetful
of
mother
family
country
and
sometimes
she
longed
to
meet
this
woman
and
judge
her
soberly
for
herself
her
mind
measured
to
its
full
extent
the
evils
which
the
innovative
spirit
of
the
age
described
to
her
as
so
dangerous
for
young
souls
by
the
rector
would
have
upon
her
only
child
until
then
so
guileless
as
pure
as
an
innocent
girl
and
beautiful
with
the
same
fresh
beauty
calyste
that
splendid
offspring
of
the
oldest
breton
race
and
the
noblest
irish
blood
had
been
nurtured
by
his
mother
with
the
utmost
care
until
the
moment
when
the
baroness
made
over
the
training
of
him
to
the
rector
of
guerande
she
was
certain
that
no
impure
word
no
evil
thought
had
sullied
the
ears
or
entered
the
mind
of
her
precious
son
after
nursing
him
at
her
bosom
giving
him
her
own
life
twice
as
it
were
after
guiding
his
footsteps
as
a
little
child
the
mother
had
put
him
with
all
his
virgin
innocence
into
the
hands
of
the
pastor
who
out
of
true
reverence
for
the
family
had
promised
to
give
him
a
thorough
and
christian
education
calyste
thenceforth
received
the
instruction
which
the
abbe
himself
had
received
at
the
seminary
the
baroness
taught
him
english
and
a
teacher
of
mathematics
was
found
not
without
difficulty
among
the
employes
at
calyste
was
therefore
necessarily
ignorant
of
modern
literature
and
the
advance
and
present
progress
of
the
sciences
his
education
had
been
limited
to
geography
and
the
circumspect
history
of
a
young
ladies
the
latin
and
greek
of
seminaries
the
literature
of
the
dead
languages
and
to
a
very
restricted
choice
of
french
writers
when
at
sixteen
he
began
what
the
abbe
grimont
called
his
philosophy
he
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
what
he
was
when
fanny
placed
him
in
the
abbe
s
hands
the
church
had
proved
as
maternal
as
the
mother
without
being
or
ridiculous
the
idolized
young
lad
was
a
fervent
catholic
for
this
son
so
noble
so
innocent
the
baroness
desired
to
provide
a
happy
life
in
obscurity
she
expected
to
inherit
some
property
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
sterling
from
an
aunt
this
sum
joined
to
the
small
present
fortune
of
the
guenics
might
enable
her
to
find
a
wife
for
calyste
who
would
bring
him
twelve
or
even
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
charlotte
de
kergarouet
with
her
aunt
s
fortune
a
rich
irish
girl
or
any
other
good
heiress
would
have
suited
the
baroness
who
seemed
indifferent
as
to
choice
she
was
ignorant
of
love
having
never
known
it
and
like
all
the
other
persons
grouped
about
her
she
saw
nothing
in
marriage
but
a
means
of
fortune
passion
was
an
unknown
thing
to
these
catholic
souls
these
old
people
exclusively
concerned
about
salvation
god
the
king
and
their
property
no
one
should
be
surprised
therefore
at
the
foreboding
thoughts
which
accompanied
the
wounded
feelings
of
the
mother
who
lived
as
much
for
the
future
interests
of
her
son
as
by
her
love
for
him
if
the
young
household
would
only
listen
to
wisdom
she
thought
the
coming
generation
of
the
du
guenics
by
enduring
privations
and
saving
as
people
do
save
in
the
provinces
would
be
able
to
buy
back
their
estates
and
recover
in
the
end
the
lustre
of
wealth
the
baroness
prayed
for
a
long
age
that
she
might
see
the
dawn
of
this
prosperous
era
mademoiselle
du
guenic
had
understood
and
fully
adopted
this
hope
which
mademoiselle
des
touches
now
threatened
to
overthrow
the
baroness
heard
midnight
strike
with
tears
her
mind
conceived
of
many
horrors
during
the
next
hour
for
the
clock
struck
one
and
calyste
was
still
not
at
home
will
he
stay
there
she
thought
it
would
be
the
first
time
poor
child
at
that
moment
calyste
s
step
resounded
in
the
lane
the
poor
mother
in
whose
heart
rejoicing
drove
out
anxiety
flew
from
the
house
to
the
gate
and
opened
it
for
her
boy
oh
cried
calyste
in
a
grieved
voice
my
darling
mother
why
did
you
sit
up
for
me
i
have
a
and
the
you
know
very
well
my
child
that
i
can
not
sleep
when
you
are
out
she
said
kissing
him
when
the
baroness
reached
the
salon
she
looked
at
her
son
to
discover
if
possible
from
the
expression
of
his
face
the
events
of
the
evening
but
he
caused
her
as
usual
an
emotion
that
frequency
never
weakened
an
emotion
which
all
loving
mothers
feel
at
sight
of
a
human
masterpiece
made
by
them
this
sentiment
blues
their
sight
and
supersedes
all
others
for
the
moment
except
for
the
black
eyes
full
of
energy
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
which
he
derived
from
his
father
calyste
in
other
respects
resembled
his
mother
he
had
her
beautiful
golden
hair
her
lovable
mouth
the
same
curving
fingers
the
same
soft
delicate
and
purely
white
skin
though
slightly
resembling
a
girl
disguised
as
a
man
his
physical
strength
was
herculean
his
muscles
had
the
suppleness
and
vigor
of
steel
springs
and
the
singularity
of
his
black
eyes
and
fair
complexion
was
by
no
means
without
charm
his
beard
had
not
yet
sprouted
this
delay
it
is
said
is
a
promise
of
longevity
the
chevalier
was
dressed
in
a
short
coat
of
black
velvet
like
that
of
his
mother
s
gown
trimmed
with
silver
buttons
a
blue
foulard
necktie
trousers
of
gray
jean
and
a
becoming
pair
of
gaiters
his
white
brow
bore
the
signs
of
great
fatigue
caused
to
an
observer
s
eye
by
the
weight
of
painful
thoughts
but
his
mother
incapable
of
supposing
that
troubles
could
wring
his
heart
attributed
his
evident
weariness
to
passing
excitement
calyste
was
as
handsome
as
a
greek
god
and
handsome
without
conceit
in
the
first
place
he
had
his
mother
s
beauty
constantly
before
him
and
next
he
cared
very
little
for
personal
advantages
which
he
found
useless
those
beautiful
pure
cheeks
thought
his
mother
where
the
rich
young
blood
is
flowing
belong
to
another
woman
she
is
the
mistress
of
that
innocent
brow
ah
passion
will
lead
to
many
evils
it
will
tarnish
the
look
of
those
eyes
moist
as
the
eyes
of
an
infant
this
bitter
thought
wrung
fanny
s
heart
and
destroyed
her
pleasure
it
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
calculate
expenses
that
in
a
family
of
six
persons
compelled
to
live
on
three
thousand
francs
a
year
the
son
should
have
a
coat
and
the
mother
a
gown
of
velvet
but
fanny
o
brien
had
aunts
and
rich
relations
in
london
who
recalled
themselves
to
her
remembrance
by
many
presents
several
of
her
sisters
married
to
great
wealth
took
enough
interest
in
calyste
to
wish
to
find
him
an
heiress
knowing
that
he
like
fanny
their
exiled
favorite
was
noble
and
handsome
you
stayed
at
les
touches
longer
than
you
did
last
night
my
dear
one
said
the
mother
at
last
in
an
agitated
tone
yes
dear
mother
he
answered
offering
no
explanation
the
curtness
of
this
answer
brought
clouds
to
his
mother
s
brow
and
she
resolved
to
postpone
the
explanation
till
the
morrow
when
mothers
admit
the
anxieties
which
were
now
torturing
the
baroness
they
tremble
before
their
sons
they
feel
instinctively
the
effect
of
the
great
emancipation
that
comes
with
love
they
perceive
what
that
sentiment
is
about
to
take
from
them
but
they
have
at
the
same
time
a
sense
of
joy
in
knowing
that
their
sons
are
happy
conflicting
feelings
battle
in
their
hearts
though
the
result
may
be
the
development
of
their
sons
into
superior
men
true
mothers
do
not
like
this
forced
abdication
they
would
rather
keep
their
children
small
and
still
requiring
protection
perhaps
that
is
the
secret
of
their
predilection
for
feeble
deformed
or
offspring
you
are
tired
dear
child
go
to
bed
she
said
repressing
her
tears
a
mother
who
does
not
know
all
that
her
son
is
doing
thinks
the
worst
that
is
if
a
mother
loves
as
much
and
is
as
much
beloved
as
fanny
but
perhaps
all
other
mothers
would
have
trembled
now
as
she
did
the
patient
care
of
twenty
years
might
be
rendered
worthless
this
human
masterpiece
of
virtuous
and
noble
and
religious
education
calyste
might
be
destroyed
the
happiness
of
his
life
so
long
and
carefully
prepared
for
might
be
forever
ruined
by
this
woman
the
next
day
calyste
slept
till
for
his
mother
would
not
have
him
wakened
mariotte
served
the
spoiled
child
s
breakfast
in
his
bed
the
inflexible
and
rules
which
regulated
the
hours
for
meals
yielded
to
the
caprices
of
the
chevalier
if
it
became
desirable
to
extract
from
mademoiselle
du
guenic
her
array
of
keys
in
order
to
obtain
some
necessary
article
of
food
outside
of
the
meal
hours
there
was
no
other
means
of
doing
it
than
to
make
the
pretext
of
its
serving
some
fancy
of
calyste
about
one
o
clock
the
baron
his
wife
and
mademoiselle
were
seated
in
the
salon
for
they
dined
at
three
o
clock
the
baroness
was
again
reading
the
quotidienne
to
her
husband
who
was
always
more
awake
before
the
dinner
hour
as
she
finished
a
paragraph
she
heard
the
steps
of
her
son
on
the
upper
floor
and
she
dropped
the
paper
saying
calyste
must
be
going
to
dine
again
at
les
touches
he
has
dressed
he
amuses
himself
the
dear
boy
said
the
old
sister
taking
a
silver
whistle
from
her
pocket
and
whistling
once
mariotte
came
through
the
tower
and
appeared
at
the
door
of
communication
which
was
hidden
by
a
silken
curtain
like
the
other
doors
of
the
room
what
is
it
she
said
anything
wanted
the
chevalier
dines
at
les
touches
don
t
cook
the
but
we
are
not
sure
as
yet
said
the
baroness
you
seem
annoyed
sister
i
know
it
by
the
tone
of
your
monsieur
grimont
has
heard
some
very
grave
charges
against
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
for
the
last
year
has
so
changed
our
dear
changed
him
how
asked
the
baron
he
reads
all
sorts
of
ah
ah
exclaimed
the
baron
so
that
s
why
he
has
given
up
hunting
and
her
morals
are
very
reprehensible
and
she
has
taken
a
man
s
name
added
madame
du
guenic
a
war
name
i
suppose
said
the
old
man
i
was
called
l
intime
the
comte
de
fontaine
the
marquis
de
montauran
the
i
was
the
friend
of
ferdinand
who
never
submitted
any
more
than
i
did
ah
those
were
the
good
times
people
shot
each
other
but
what
of
that
we
amused
ourselves
all
the
same
here
and
this
war
memory
pushing
aside
paternal
anxiety
saddened
fanny
for
a
moment
the
rector
s
revelations
the
want
of
confidence
shown
to
her
by
calyste
had
kept
her
from
sleeping
suppose
monsieur
le
chevalier
does
love
mademoiselle
des
touches
where
s
the
harm
said
mariotte
she
has
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
she
is
very
what
is
that
you
say
mariotte
exclaimed
the
old
baron
a
guenic
marry
a
des
touches
the
des
touches
were
not
even
grooms
in
the
days
when
du
guesclin
considered
our
alliance
a
signal
a
woman
who
takes
a
man
s
name
camille
maupin
said
the
baroness
the
maupins
are
an
old
family
said
the
baron
they
bear
gules
three
he
stopped
but
she
can
not
be
a
maupin
and
a
des
touches
both
he
added
she
is
called
maupin
on
the
a
des

could
hardly
be
an
actress
said
the
old
man
really
fanny
if
i
did
not
know
you
i
should
think
you
were
out
of
your
she
writes
plays
and
books
continued
the
baroness
books
said
the
baron
looking
at
his
wife
with
an
air
of
as
much
surprise
as
though
she
were
telling
of
a
miracle
i
have
heard
that
mademoiselle
scudery
and
madame
de
sevigne
wrote
books
but
it
was
not
the
best
thing
they
are
you
going
to
dine
at
les
touches
monsieur
said
mariotte
when
calyste
entered
probably
replied
the
young
man
mariotte
was
not
inquisitive
she
was
part
of
the
family
and
she
left
the
room
without
waiting
to
hear
what
the
baroness
would
say
to
her
son
are
you
going
again
to
les
touches
my
calyste
the
baroness
emphasized
the
les
touches
is
not
a
respectable
or
decent
house
its
mistress
leads
an
irregular
life
she
will
corrupt
our
calyste
already
camille
maupin
has
made
him
read
many
books
he
has
had
adventures
you
knew
all
that
my
naughty
child
and
you
never
said
one
word
to
your
best
friends
the
chevalier
is
discreet
said
his
father
a
virtue
of
the
olden
too
discreet
said
the
jealous
mother
observing
the
red
flush
on
her
son
s
forehead
my
dear
mother
said
calyste
kneeling
down
beside
the
baroness
i
didn
t
think
it
necessary
to
publish
my
defeat
mademoiselle
des
touches
or
if
you
choose
to
call
her
so
camille
maupin
rejected
my
love
more
than
eighteen
months
ago
during
her
last
stay
at
les
touches
she
laughed
at
me
gently
saying
she
might
very
well
be
my
mother
that
a
woman
of
forty
committed
a
sort
of
crime
against
nature
in
loving
a
minor
and
that
she
herself
was
incapable
of
such
depravity
she
made
a
thousand
little
jokes
which
hurt
me
for
she
is
witty
as
an
angel
but
when
she
saw
me
weep
hot
tears
she
tried
to
comfort
me
and
offered
me
her
friendship
in
the
noblest
manner
she
has
more
heart
than
even
talent
she
is
as
generous
as
you
are
yourself
i
am
now
her
child
on
her
return
here
lately
hearing
from
her
that
she
loves
another
i
have
resigned
myself
do
not
repeat
the
calumnies
that
have
been
said
of
her
camille
is
an
artist
she
has
genius
she
leads
one
of
those
exceptional
existences
which
can
not
be
judged
like
ordinary
my
child
said
the
religious
fanny
nothing
can
excuse
a
woman
for
not
conducting
herself
as
the
church
requires
she
fails
in
her
duty
to
god
and
to
society
by
abjuring
the
gentle
tenets
of
her
sex
a
woman
commits
a
sin
in
even
going
to
a
theatre
but
to
write
the
impieties
that
actors
repeat
to
roam
about
the
world
first
with
an
enemy
to
the
pope
and
then
with
a
musician
ah
calyste
you
can
never
persuade
me
that
such
acts
are
deeds
of
faith
hope
or
charity
her
fortune
was
given
her
by
god
to
do
good
and
what
good
does
she
do
with
hers
calyste
sprang
up
suddenly
and
looked
at
his
mother
mother
he
said
camille
is
my
friend
i
can
not
hear
her
spoken
of
in
this
way
i
would
give
my
very
life
for
your
life
said
the
baroness
looking
at
her
son
with
startled
eyes
your
life
is
our
life
the
life
of
all
of
my
nephew
has
just
said
many
things
i
do
not
understand
said
the
old
woman
turning
toward
him
where
did
he
learn
them
said
the
mother
at
les
yes
my
darling
mother
she
found
me
ignorant
as
a
carp
and
she
has
taught
you
knew
the
essential
things
when
you
learned
the
duties
taught
us
by
religion
replied
the
baroness
ah
this
woman
is
fated
to
destroy
your
noble
and
sacred
the
old
maid
rose
and
solemnly
stretched
forth
her
hands
toward
her
brother
who
was
dozing
in
his
chair
calyste
she
said
in
a
voice
that
came
from
her
heart
your
father
has
never
opened
books
he
speaks
breton
he
fought
for
god
and
for
the
king
educated
people
did
the
evil
educated
noblemen
deserted
their
land
be
educated
if
you
choose
so
saying
she
sat
down
and
began
to
knit
with
a
rapidity
which
betrayed
her
inward
emotion
my
angel
said
the
mother
weeping
i
foresee
some
evil
coming
down
upon
you
in
that
who
is
making
fanny
weep
cried
the
old
man
waking
with
a
start
at
the
sound
of
his
wife
s
voice
he
looked
round
upon
his
sister
his
son
and
the
baroness
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
nothing
my
friend
replied
his
wife
mamma
said
calyste
whispering
in
his
mother
s
ear
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
explain
myself
just
now
but
you
and
i
will
talk
of
this
when
you
know
all
you
will
bless
mademoiselle
des
mothers
do
not
like
to
curse
replied
the
baroness
i
could
not
curse
a
woman
who
truly
loved
my
the
young
man
bade
adieu
to
his
father
and
went
out
the
baron
and
his
wife
rose
to
see
him
pass
through
the
open
the
gate
and
disappear
the
baroness
did
not
again
take
up
the
newspaper
she
was
too
agitated
in
this
tranquil
untroubled
life
such
a
discussion
was
the
equivalent
of
a
quarrel
in
other
homes
though
somewhat
calmed
her
motherly
uneasiness
was
not
dispersed
whither
would
such
a
friendship
which
might
claim
the
life
of
calyste
and
destroy
it
lead
her
boy
bless
mademoiselle
des
touches
how
could
that
be
these
questions
were
as
momentous
to
her
simple
soul
as
the
fury
of
revolutions
to
a
statesman
camille
maupin
was
revolution
itself
in
that
calm
and
placid
home
i
fear
that
woman
will
ruin
him
she
said
picking
up
the
paper
my
dear
fanny
said
the
old
baron
with
a
jaunty
air
you
are
too
much
of
an
angel
to
understand
these
things
mademoiselle
des
touches
is
they
say
as
black
as
a
crow
as
strong
as
a
turk
and
forty
years
old
our
dear
calyste
was
certain
to
fall
in
love
with
her
of
course
he
will
tell
certain
honorable
little
lies
to
conceal
his
happiness
let
him
alone
to
amuse
himself
with
his
first
if
it
had
been
any
other
woman
began
the
baroness
but
my
dear
fanny
if
the
woman
were
a
saint
she
would
not
accept
your
the
baroness
again
picked
up
the
paper
i
will
go
and
see
her
myself
added
the
baron
and
tell
you
all
about
this
speech
has
no
savor
at
the
present
moment
but
after
reading
the
biography
of
camille
maupin
you
can
then
imagine
the
old
baron
entering
the
lists
against
that
illustrious
woman
vi
biography
of
camille
maupin
the
town
of
guerande
which
for
two
months
past
had
seen
calyste
its
flower
and
pride
going
morning
or
evening
often
morning
and
evening
to
les
touches
concluded
that
mademoiselle
felicite
des
touches
was
passionately
in
love
with
the
beautiful
youth
and
that
she
practised
upon
him
all
kinds
of
sorceries
more
than
one
young
girl
and
wife
asked
herself
by
what
right
an
old
woman
exercised
so
absolute
an
empire
over
that
angel
when
calyste
passed
along
the
grand
rue
to
the
croisic
gate
many
a
regretful
eye
was
fastened
on
him
it
now
became
necessary
to
explain
the
rumors
which
hovered
about
the
person
whom
calyste
was
on
his
way
to
see
these
rumors
swelled
by
breton
gossip
envenomed
by
public
ignorance
had
reached
the
rector
the
receiver
of
taxes
the
de
the
head
of
the
and
other
lettered
persons
had
not
reassured
the
abbe
by
relating
to
him
the
strange
and
fantastic
life
of
the
female
writer
who
concealed
herself
under
the
masculine
name
of
camille
maupin
she
did
not
as
yet
eat
little
children
nor
kill
her
slaves
like
cleopatra
nor
throw
men
into
the
river
as
the
heroine
of
the
tour
de
nesle
was
falsely
accused
of
doing
but
to
the
abbe
grimont
this
monstrous
creature
a
cross
between
a
siren
and
an
atheist
was
an
immoral
combination
of
woman
and
philosopher
who
violated
every
social
law
invented
to
restrain
or
utilize
the
infirmities
of
womankind
just
as
clara
gazul
is
the
female
pseudonym
of
a
distinguished
male
writer
george
sand
the
masculine
pseudonym
of
a
woman
of
genius
so
camille
maupin
was
the
mask
behind
which
was
long
hidden
a
charming
young
woman
very
a
breton
named
felicite
des
touches
the
person
who
was
now
causing
such
lively
anxiety
to
the
baronne
du
guenic
and
the
excellent
rector
of
guerande
the
breton
des
touches
family
has
no
connection
with
the
family
of
the
same
name
in
touraine
to
which
belongs
the
ambassador
of
the
regent
even
more
famous
for
his
writings
than
for
his
diplomatic
talents
camille
maupin
one
of
the
few
celebrated
women
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
long
supposed
to
be
a
man
on
account
of
the
virility
of
her
first
writings
all
the
world
now
knows
the
two
volumes
of
plays
not
intended
for
representation
on
the
stage
written
after
the
manner
of
shakespeare
or
lopez
de
vega
published
in
which
made
a
sort
of
literary
revolution
when
the
great
question
of
the
classics
and
the
romanticists
palpitated
on
all
sides
in
the
newspapers
at
the
clubs
at
the
academy
everywhere
since
then
camille
maupin
has
written
several
plays
and
a
novel
which
have
not
belied
the
success
obtained
by
her
first
publication
now
perhaps
too
much
forgotten
to
explain
by
what
of
circumstances
the
masculine
incarnation
of
a
young
girl
was
brought
about
why
felicite
des
touches
became
a
man
and
an
author
and
why
more
fortunate
than
madame
de
stael
she
kept
her
freedom
and
was
thus
more
excusable
for
her
celebrity
would
be
to
satisfy
many
curiosities
and
do
justice
to
one
of
those
abnormal
beings
who
rise
in
humanity
like
monuments
and
whose
fame
is
promoted
by
its
rarity
for
in
twenty
centuries
we
can
count
at
most
twenty
famous
women
therefore
although
in
these
pages
she
stands
as
a
secondary
character
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
she
plays
a
great
part
in
the
literary
history
of
our
epoch
and
that
her
influence
over
calyste
was
great
no
one
we
think
will
regret
being
made
to
pause
before
that
figure
rather
longer
than
modern
art
permits
mademoiselle
felicite
des
touches
became
an
orphan
in
her
property
escaped
confiscation
by
reason
of
the
deaths
of
her
father
and
brother
the
first
was
killed
on
the
of
august
at
the
threshold
of
the
palace
among
the
defenders
of
the
king
near
whose
person
his
rank
as
major
of
the
guards
of
the
gate
had
placed
him
her
brother
one
of
the
was
massacred
at
les
carmes
mademoiselle
des
touches
was
two
years
old
when
her
mother
died
killed
by
grief
a
few
days
after
this
second
catastrophe
when
dying
madame
des
touches
confided
her
daughter
to
her
sister
a
nun
of
chelles
madame
de
faucombe
the
nun
prudently
took
the
orphan
to
faucombe
a
estate
near
nantes
belonging
to
madame
des
touches
and
there
she
settled
with
the
little
girl
and
three
sisters
of
her
convent
the
populace
of
nantes
during
the
last
days
of
the
terror
tore
down
the
chateau
seized
the
nuns
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
threw
them
into
prison
on
a
false
charge
of
receiving
emissaries
of
pitt
and
coburg
the
thermidor
released
them
felicite
s
aunt
died
of
fear
two
of
the
sisters
left
france
and
the
third
confided
the
little
girl
to
her
nearest
relation
monsieur
de
faucombe
her
maternal
who
lived
in
nantes
monsieur
de
faucombe
an
old
man
sixty
years
of
age
had
married
a
young
woman
to
whom
he
left
the
management
of
his
affairs
he
busied
himself
in
archaeology
a
passion
or
to
speak
more
correctly
one
of
those
manias
which
enable
old
men
to
fancy
themselves
still
living
the
education
of
his
ward
was
therefore
left
to
chance
little
by
her
uncle
s
wife
a
young
woman
given
over
to
the
social
pleasures
of
the
imperial
epoch
felicite
brought
herself
up
as
a
boy
she
kept
company
with
monsieur
de
faucombe
in
his
library
where
she
read
everything
it
pleased
her
to
read
she
thus
obtained
a
knowledge
of
life
in
theory
and
had
no
innocence
of
mind
though
virgin
personally
her
intellect
floated
on
the
impurities
of
knowledge
while
her
heart
was
pure
her
learning
became
extraordinary
the
result
of
a
passion
for
reading
sustained
by
a
powerful
memory
at
eighteen
years
of
age
she
was
as
on
all
topics
as
a
young
man
entering
a
literary
career
has
need
to
be
in
our
day
her
prodigious
reading
controlled
her
passions
far
more
than
conventual
life
would
have
done
for
there
the
imaginations
of
young
girls
run
riot
a
brain
crammed
with
knowledge
that
was
neither
digested
nor
classed
governed
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
child
this
depravity
of
the
intellect
without
action
upon
the
chastity
of
the
body
would
have
amazed
philosophers
and
observers
had
any
one
in
nantes
even
suspected
the
powers
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
the
result
of
all
this
was
in
a
contrary
direction
to
the
cause
felicite
had
no
inclinations
toward
evil
she
conceived
everything
by
thought
but
abstained
from
deed
old
faucombe
was
enchanted
with
her
and
she
helped
him
in
his
work
writing
three
of
his
books
which
the
worthy
old
gentleman
believed
were
his
own
for
his
spiritual
paternity
was
blind
such
mental
labor
not
agreeing
with
the
developments
of
girlhood
had
its
effect
felicite
fell
ill
her
blood
was
overheated
and
her
chest
seemed
threatened
with
inflammation
the
doctors
ordered
horseback
exercise
and
the
amusements
of
society
mademoiselle
des
touches
became
in
consequence
an
admirable
horsewoman
and
recovered
her
health
in
a
few
months
at
the
age
of
eighteen
she
appeared
in
the
world
where
she
produced
so
great
a
sensation
that
no
one
in
nantes
called
her
anything
else
than
the
beautiful
mademoiselle
des
led
to
enter
society
by
one
of
the
imperishable
sentiments
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
however
superior
she
may
be
the
worship
she
inspired
found
her
cold
and
unresponsive
hurt
by
her
aunt
and
her
cousins
who
ridiculed
her
studies
and
teased
her
about
her
unwillingness
for
society
which
they
attributed
to
a
lack
of
the
power
of
pleasing
felicite
resolved
on
making
herself
coquettish
gay
volatile
a
woman
in
short
but
she
expected
in
return
an
exchange
of
ideas
seductions
and
pleasures
in
harmony
with
the
elevation
of
her
own
mind
and
the
extent
of
its
knowledge
instead
of
that
she
was
filled
with
disgust
for
the
commonplaces
of
conversation
the
silliness
of
gallantry
and
more
especially
was
she
shocked
by
the
supremacy
of
military
men
to
whom
society
made
obeisance
at
that
period
she
had
not
unnaturally
neglected
the
minor
accomplishments
finding
herself
inferior
to
the
pretty
dolls
who
played
on
the
piano
and
made
themselves
agreeable
by
singing
ballads
she
determined
to
be
a
musician
retiring
into
her
former
solitude
she
set
to
work
resolvedly
under
the
direction
of
the
best
master
in
the
town
she
was
rich
and
she
sent
for
steibelt
when
the
time
came
to
perfect
herself
the
astonished
town
still
talks
of
this
princely
conduct
the
stay
of
that
master
cost
her
twelve
thousand
francs
later
when
she
went
to
paris
she
studied
harmony
and
and
composed
the
music
of
two
operas
which
have
had
great
success
though
the
public
has
never
been
admitted
to
the
secret
of
their
authorship
ostensibly
these
operas
are
by
conti
one
of
the
most
eminent
musicians
of
our
day
but
this
circumstance
belongs
to
the
history
of
her
heart
and
will
be
mentioned
later
on
the
mediocrity
of
the
society
of
a
provincial
town
wearied
her
so
excessively
her
imagination
was
so
filled
with
grandiose
ideas
that
although
she
returned
to
the
salons
to
eclipse
other
women
once
more
by
her
beauty
and
enjoy
her
new
triumph
as
a
musician
she
again
deserted
them
and
having
proved
her
power
to
her
cousins
and
driven
two
lovers
to
despair
she
returned
to
her
books
her
piano
the
works
of
beethoven
and
her
old
friend
faucombe
in
when
she
was
years
of
age
the
old
archaeologist
handed
over
to
her
his
guardianship
accounts
from
that
year
she
took
control
of
her
fortune
which
consisted
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
derived
from
les
touches
the
property
of
her
father
twelve
thousand
a
year
from
faucombe
which
however
she
increased
on
renewing
the
leases
and
a
capital
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
laid
by
during
her
minority
by
her
guardians
felicite
acquired
from
her
experience
of
provincial
life
an
understanding
of
money
and
that
strong
tendency
to
administrative
wisdom
which
enables
the
provinces
to
hold
their
own
under
the
ascensional
movement
of
capital
towards
paris
she
drew
her
three
hundred
thousand
francs
from
the
house
of
business
where
her
guardian
had
placed
them
and
invested
them
on
the
at
the
very
moment
of
the
disasters
of
the
retreat
from
moscow
in
this
way
she
increased
her
income
by
thirty
thousand
francs
all
expenses
paid
she
found
herself
with
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
to
invest
at
years
of
age
a
girl
with
such
force
of
will
is
the
equal
of
a
man
of
thirty
her
mind
had
taken
a
wide
range
habits
of
criticism
enabled
her
to
judge
soberly
of
men
and
art
and
things
and
public
questions
henceforth
she
resolved
to
leave
nantes
but
old
faucombe
falling
ill
with
his
last
illness
she
who
had
been
both
wife
and
daughter
to
him
remained
to
nurse
him
with
the
devotion
of
an
angel
for
eighteen
months
closing
his
eyes
at
the
moment
when
napoleon
was
struggling
with
all
europe
on
the
corpse
of
france
her
removal
to
paris
was
therefore
still
further
postponed
until
the
close
of
that
crisis
as
a
royalist
she
hastened
to
be
present
at
the
return
of
the
bourbons
to
paris
there
the
grandlieus
to
whom
she
was
related
received
her
as
their
guest
but
the
catastrophes
of
march
intervened
and
her
future
was
vague
and
uncertain
she
was
thus
enabled
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
last
image
of
the
empire
and
behold
the
grand
army
when
it
came
to
the
champ
de
mars
as
to
a
roman
circus
to
salute
its
caesar
before
it
went
to
its
death
at
waterloo
the
great
and
noble
soul
of
felicite
was
stirred
by
that
magic
spectacle
the
political
commotions
the
glamour
of
that
theatrical
play
of
three
months
which
history
has
called
the
hundred
days
occupied
her
mind
and
preserved
her
from
all
personal
emotions
in
the
midst
of
a
convulsion
which
dispersed
the
royalist
society
among
whom
she
had
intended
to
reside
the
grandlieus
followed
the
bourbons
to
ghent
leaving
their
house
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
felicite
who
did
not
choose
to
take
a
subordinate
position
purchased
for
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
francs
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
the
rue
mont
blanc
where
she
installed
herself
on
the
return
of
the
bourbons
in
the
garden
of
this
house
is
worth
two
millions
accustomed
to
control
her
own
life
felicite
soon
familiarized
herself
with
the
ways
of
thought
and
action
which
are
held
to
be
exclusively
the
province
of
man
in
she
was
years
old
she
knew
nothing
of
marriage
her
conception
of
it
was
wholly
that
of
thought
she
judged
it
in
its
causes
instead
of
its
effect
and
saw
only
its
objectionable
side
her
superior
mind
refused
to
make
the
abdication
by
which
a
married
woman
begins
that
life
she
keenly
felt
the
value
of
independence
and
was
conscious
of
disgust
for
the
duties
of
maternity
it
is
necessary
to
give
these
details
to
explain
the
anomalies
presented
by
the
life
of
camille
maupin
she
had
known
neither
father
nor
mother
she
had
been
her
own
mistress
from
childhood
her
guardian
was
an
old
archaeologist
chance
had
flung
her
into
the
regions
of
knowledge
and
of
imagination
into
the
world
of
literature
instead
of
holding
her
within
the
rigid
circle
defined
by
the
futile
education
given
to
women
and
by
maternal
instructions
as
to
dress
hypocritical
propriety
and
the
hunting
graces
of
their
sex
thus
long
before
she
became
celebrated
a
glance
might
have
told
an
observer
that
she
had
never
played
with
dolls
toward
the
close
of
the
year
felicite
des
touches
began
to
perceive
not
the
fading
of
her
beauty
but
the
beginning
of
a
certain
lassitude
of
body
she
saw
that
a
change
would
presently
take
place
in
her
person
as
the
result
of
her
obstinate
celibacy
she
wanted
to
retain
her
youth
and
beauty
to
which
at
that
time
she
clung
science
warned
her
of
the
sentence
pronounced
by
nature
upon
all
her
creations
which
perish
as
much
by
the
misconception
of
her
laws
as
by
the
abuse
of
them
the
macerated
face
of
her
aunt
returned
to
her
memory
and
made
her
shudder
placed
between
marriage
and
love
her
desire
was
to
keep
her
freedom
but
she
was
now
no
longer
indifferent
to
homage
and
the
admiration
that
surrounded
her
she
was
at
the
moment
when
this
history
begins
almost
exactly
what
she
was
in
eighteen
years
had
passed
over
her
head
and
respected
it
at
forty
she
might
have
been
thought
no
more
than
therefore
to
describe
her
in
is
to
picture
her
as
she
was
in
women
who
know
the
conditions
of
temperament
and
happiness
in
which
a
woman
should
live
to
resist
the
ravages
of
time
will
understand
how
and
why
felicite
des
touches
enjoyed
this
great
privilege
as
they
study
a
portrait
for
which
were
reserved
the
brightest
tints
of
nature
s
palette
and
the
richest
setting
brittany
presents
a
curious
problem
to
be
solved
in
the
predominance
of
dark
hair
brown
eyes
and
swarthy
complexions
in
a
region
so
near
england
that
the
atmospheric
effects
are
almost
identical
does
this
problem
belong
to
the
great
question
of
races
to
hitherto
unobserved
physical
influences
science
may
some
day
find
the
reason
of
this
peculiarity
which
ceases
in
the
adjoining
province
of
normandy
waiting
its
solution
this
odd
fact
is
there
before
our
eyes
fair
complexions
are
rare
in
brittany
where
the
women
s
eyes
are
as
black
and
lively
as
those
of
southern
women
but
instead
of
possessing
the
tall
figures
and
swaying
lines
of
italy
and
spain
they
are
usually
short
well
and
firm
except
in
the
higher
classes
which
are
crossed
by
their
alliances
mademoiselle
des
touches
a
true
breton
is
of
medium
height
though
she
looks
taller
than
she
really
is
this
effect
is
produced
by
the
character
of
her
face
which
gives
height
to
her
form
she
has
that
skin
olive
by
day
and
dazzling
by
candlelight
which
distinguishes
a
beautiful
italian
you
might
if
you
pleased
call
it
animated
ivory
the
light
glides
along
a
skin
of
that
texture
as
on
a
polished
surface
it
shines
a
violent
emotion
is
necessary
to
bring
the
faintest
color
to
the
centre
of
the
cheeks
where
it
goes
away
almost
immediately
this
peculiarity
gives
to
her
face
the
calm
impassibility
of
the
savage
the
face
more
long
than
oval
resembles
that
of
some
beautiful
isis
in
the
egyptian
it
has
the
purity
of
the
heads
of
sphinxes
polished
by
the
fire
of
the
desert
kissed
by
a
coptic
sun
the
tones
of
the
skin
are
in
harmony
with
the
faultless
modelling
of
the
head
the
black
and
abundant
hair
descends
in
heavy
masses
beside
the
throat
like
the
coif
of
the
statues
at
memphis
and
carries
out
magnificently
the
general
severity
of
form
the
forehead
is
full
broad
and
swelling
about
the
temples
illuminated
by
surfaces
which
catch
the
light
and
modelled
like
the
brow
of
the
hunting
diana
a
powerful
and
determined
brow
silent
and
the
arch
of
the
vigorously
drawn
surmounts
a
pair
of
eyes
whose
flame
scintillates
at
times
like
that
of
a
fixed
star
the
white
of
the
eye
is
neither
bluish
nor
strewn
with
scarlet
threads
nor
is
it
purely
white
it
has
the
texture
of
horn
but
the
tone
is
warm
the
pupil
is
surrounded
by
an
orange
circle
it
is
of
bronze
set
in
gold
but
vivid
gold
and
animated
bronze
this
pupil
has
depth
it
is
not
underlaid
as
in
certain
eyes
by
a
species
of
foil
which
sends
back
the
light
and
makes
such
eyes
resemble
those
of
cats
or
tigers
it
has
not
that
terrible
inflexibility
which
makes
a
sensitive
person
shudder
but
this
depth
has
in
it
something
of
the
infinite
just
as
the
external
radiance
of
the
eyes
suggests
the
absolute
the
glance
of
an
observer
may
be
lost
in
that
soul
which
gathers
itself
up
and
retires
with
as
much
rapidity
as
it
gushed
for
a
second
into
those
velvet
eyes
in
moments
of
passion
the
eyes
of
camille
maupin
are
sublime
the
gold
of
her
glance
illuminates
them
and
they
flame
but
in
repose
they
are
dull
the
torpor
of
meditation
often
lends
them
an
appearance
of
stupidity
in
like
manner
when
the
glow
of
the
soul
is
absent
the
lines
of
the
face
are
sad
george
sand
says
of
herself
in
l
histoire
de
ma
vie
published
long
after
the
above
was
written
the
habit
of
meditation
gave
me
air
a
stupid
air
i
say
the
word
frankly
for
all
my
life
i
have
been
told
this
and
therefore
it
must
be
tr
the
lashes
of
the
eyelids
are
short
but
thick
and
black
as
the
tip
of
an
ermine
s
tail
the
eyelids
are
brown
and
strewn
with
red
fibrils
which
give
them
grace
and
strength
two
qualities
which
are
seldom
united
in
a
woman
the
circle
round
the
eyes
shows
not
the
slightest
blemish
nor
the
smallest
wrinkle
there
again
we
find
the
granite
of
an
egyptian
statue
softened
by
the
ages
but
the
line
of
the
though
soft
is
more
pronounced
than
in
other
women
and
completes
the
character
of
strength
which
the
face
expresses
the
nose
thin
and
straight
parts
into
two
oblique
nostrils
passionately
dilated
at
times
and
showing
the
transparent
pink
of
their
delicate
lining
this
nose
is
an
admirable
continuation
of
the
forehead
with
which
it
blends
in
a
most
delicious
line
it
is
perfectly
white
from
its
spring
to
its
tip
and
the
tip
is
endowed
with
a
sort
of
mobility
which
does
marvels
if
camille
is
indignant
or
angry
or
rebellious
there
above
all
as
talma
once
remarked
is
seen
depicted
the
anger
or
the
irony
of
great
minds
the
immobility
of
the
human
nostril
indicates
a
certain
narrowness
of
soul
never
did
the
nose
of
a
miser
oscillate
it
contracts
like
the
lips
he
locks
up
his
face
as
he
does
his
money
camille
s
mouth
arching
at
the
corners
is
of
a
vivid
red
blood
abounds
there
and
supplies
the
living
thinking
oxide
which
gives
such
seduction
to
the
lips
reassuring
the
lover
whom
the
gravity
of
that
majestic
face
may
have
dismayed
the
upper
lip
is
thin
the
furrow
which
unites
it
with
the
nose
comes
low
giving
it
a
centre
curve
which
emphasizes
its
natural
disdain
camille
has
little
to
do
to
express
anger
this
beautiful
lip
is
supported
by
the
strong
red
breadth
of
its
lower
mate
adorable
in
kindness
swelling
with
love
a
lip
like
the
outer
petal
of
a
pomegranate
such
as
phidias
might
have
carved
and
the
color
of
which
it
has
the
chin
is
firm
and
rather
full
but
it
expresses
resolution
and
fitly
ends
this
profile
royal
if
not
divine
it
is
necessary
to
add
that
the
upper
lip
beneath
the
nose
is
lightly
shaded
by
a
charming
down
nature
would
have
made
a
blunder
had
she
not
cast
that
tender
mist
upon
the
face
the
ears
are
delicately
convoluted
a
sign
of
secret
refinement
the
bust
is
large
the
waist
slim
and
sufficiently
rounded
the
hips
are
not
prominent
but
very
graceful
the
line
of
the
thighs
is
magnificent
recalling
bacchus
rather
than
the
venus
callipyge
there
we
may
see
the
shadowy
line
of
demarcation
which
separates
nearly
every
woman
of
genius
from
her
sex
there
such
women
are
found
to
have
a
certain
vague
similitude
to
man
they
have
neither
the
suppleness
nor
the
soft
abandonment
of
those
whom
nature
destines
for
maternity
their
gait
is
not
broken
by
faltering
motions
this
observation
may
be
called
it
has
its
counterpart
in
men
whose
thighs
are
those
of
women
when
they
are
sly
cunning
false
and
cowardly
camille
s
neck
instead
of
curving
inward
at
the
nape
curves
out
in
a
line
that
unites
the
head
to
the
shoulders
without
sinuosity
a
most
signal
characteristic
of
force
the
neck
itself
presents
at
certain
moments
an
athletic
magnificence
the
spring
of
the
arms
from
the
shoulders
superb
in
outline
seems
to
belong
to
a
colossal
woman
the
arms
are
vigorously
modelled
ending
in
wrists
of
english
delicacy
and
charming
hands
plump
dimpled
and
adorned
with
rosy
nails
these
hands
are
of
a
whiteness
which
reveals
that
the
body
so
round
so
firm
so
well
is
of
another
complexion
altogether
than
the
face
the
firm
cold
carriage
of
the
head
is
corrected
by
the
mobility
of
the
lips
their
changing
expression
and
the
artistic
play
of
the
nostrils
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
promises
hidden
perhaps
from
the
profane
the
calm
of
that
countenance
has
something
i
know
not
what
that
is
vexatious
more
sad
more
serious
than
gracious
that
face
is
marked
by
the
melancholy
of
constant
meditation
for
this
reason
mademoiselle
des
touches
listens
more
than
she
talks
she
startles
by
her
silence
and
by
that
glance
of
intense
fixity
no
educated
person
could
see
her
without
thinking
of
cleopatra
that
dark
little
woman
who
almost
changed
the
face
of
the
world
but
in
camille
the
natural
animal
is
so
complete
so
of
a
nature
so
leonine
that
a
man
however
little
of
a
turk
he
may
be
regrets
the
presence
of
so
great
a
mind
in
such
a
body
and
could
wish
that
she
were
wholly
woman
he
fears
to
find
the
strange
distortion
of
an
abnormal
soul
do
not
cold
analysis
and
theory
point
to
passions
in
such
a
woman
does
she
judge
and
not
feel
or
phenomenon
more
terrible
does
she
not
feel
and
judge
at
one
and
the
same
time
able
for
all
things
through
her
brain
ought
her
course
to
be
circumscribed
by
the
limitations
of
other
women
has
that
intellectual
strength
weakened
her
heart
has
she
no
charm
can
she
descend
to
those
tender
nothings
by
which
a
woman
occupies
and
soothes
and
interests
the
man
she
loves
will
she
not
cast
aside
a
sentiment
when
it
no
longer
responds
to
some
vision
of
infinitude
which
she
grasps
and
contemplates
in
her
soul
who
can
scale
the
heights
to
which
her
eyes
have
risen
yes
a
man
fears
to
find
in
such
a
woman
something
unattainable
unpossessable
unconquerable
the
woman
of
strong
mind
should
remain
a
symbol
as
a
reality
she
must
be
feared
camille
maupin
is
in
some
ways
the
living
image
of
schiller
s
isis
seated
in
the
darkness
of
the
temple
at
whose
feet
her
priests
find
the
dead
bodies
of
the
daring
men
who
have
consulted
her
the
adventures
of
her
life
declared
to
be
true
by
the
world
and
which
camille
has
never
disavowed
enforce
the
questions
suggested
by
her
personal
appearance
perhaps
she
likes
those
calumnies
the
nature
of
her
beauty
has
not
been
without
its
influence
on
her
fame
it
has
served
it
just
as
her
fortune
and
position
have
maintained
her
in
society
if
a
sculptor
desires
to
make
a
statue
of
brittany
let
him
take
mademoiselle
des
touches
for
his
model
that
powerful
temperament
is
the
only
nature
capable
of
repelling
the
action
of
time
the
constant
nourishment
of
the
pulp
so
to
speak
of
that
polished
skin
is
an
arm
given
to
women
by
nature
to
resist
the
invasion
of
wrinkles
in
camille
s
case
it
was
aided
by
the
calm
impassibility
of
her
features
in
this
charming
young
woman
opened
her
house
to
artists
authors
of
renown
learned
and
scientific
men
and
publicists
a
society
toward
which
her
tastes
led
her
her
salon
resembled
that
of
baron
gerard
where
men
of
rank
mingled
with
men
of
distinction
of
all
kinds
and
the
elite
of
parisian
women
came
the
parentage
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
her
fortune
increased
by
that
of
her
aunt
the
nun
protected
her
in
the
attempt
always
very
difficult
in
paris
to
create
a
society
her
worldly
independence
was
one
reason
of
her
success
various
ambitious
mothers
indulged
in
the
hope
of
inducing
her
to
marry
their
sons
whose
fortunes
were
out
of
proportion
to
the
age
of
their
escutcheons
several
peers
of
france
allured
by
the
prospect
of
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
house
magnificently
appointed
took
their
womenkind
even
the
most
fastidious
and
intractable
to
visit
her
the
diplomatic
world
always
in
search
of
amusements
of
the
intellect
came
there
and
found
enjoyment
thus
mademoiselle
des
touches
surrounded
by
so
many
forms
of
individual
interests
was
able
to
study
the
different
comedies
which
passion
covetousness
and
ambition
make
the
generality
of
men
perform
even
those
who
are
highest
in
the
social
scale
she
saw
early
in
life
the
world
as
it
is
and
she
was
fortunate
enough
not
to
fall
early
into
absorbing
love
which
warps
the
mind
and
faculties
of
a
woman
and
prevents
her
from
judging
soberly
ordinarily
a
woman
feels
enjoys
and
judges
successively
hence
three
distinct
ages
the
last
of
which
coincides
with
the
mournful
period
of
old
age
in
mademoiselle
des
touches
this
order
was
reversed
her
youth
was
wrapped
in
the
snows
of
knowledge
and
the
ice
of
reflection
this
transposition
is
in
truth
an
additional
explanation
of
the
strangeness
of
her
life
and
the
nature
of
her
talent
she
observed
men
at
an
age
when
most
women
can
only
see
one
man
she
despised
what
other
women
admired
she
detected
falsehood
in
the
flatteries
they
accept
as
truths
she
laughed
at
things
that
made
them
serious
this
contradiction
of
her
life
with
that
of
others
lasted
long
but
it
came
to
a
terrible
end
she
was
destined
to
find
in
her
soul
a
first
love
young
and
fresh
at
an
age
when
women
are
summoned
by
nature
to
renounce
all
love
meantime
a
first
affair
in
which
she
was
involved
has
always
remained
a
secret
from
the
world
felicite
like
other
women
was
induced
to
believe
that
beauty
of
body
was
that
of
soul
she
fell
in
love
with
a
face
and
learned
to
her
cost
the
folly
of
a
man
of
gallantry
who
saw
nothing
in
her
but
a
mere
woman
it
was
some
time
before
she
recovered
from
the
disgust
she
felt
at
this
episode
her
distress
was
perceived
by
a
friend
a
man
who
consoled
her
without
personal
or
at
any
rate
he
concealed
any
such
motive
if
he
had
it
in
him
felicite
believed
she
found
the
heart
and
mind
which
were
lacking
to
her
former
lover
he
did
in
truth
possess
one
of
the
most
original
minds
of
our
age
he
too
wrote
under
a
pseudonym
and
his
first
publications
were
those
of
an
adorer
of
italy
travel
was
the
one
form
of
education
which
felicite
lacked
a
man
of
genius
a
poet
and
a
critic
he
took
felicite
to
italy
in
order
to
make
known
to
her
that
country
of
all
art
this
celebrated
man
who
is
nameless
may
be
regarded
as
the
master
and
maker
of
camille
he
bought
into
order
and
shape
the
vast
amount
of
knowledge
already
acquired
by
felicite
increased
it
by
study
of
the
masterpieces
with
which
italy
teems
gave
her
the
frankness
freedom
and
grace
epigrammatic
and
intense
which
is
the
character
of
his
own
talent
always
rather
fanciful
as
to
form
which
camille
maupin
modified
by
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
the
softer
terms
of
thought
that
are
natural
to
a
woman
he
also
roused
in
her
a
taste
for
german
and
english
literature
and
made
her
learn
both
languages
while
travelling
in
rome
in
felicite
was
deserted
for
an
italian
without
that
misery
she
might
never
have
been
celebrated
napoleon
called
misfortune
the
midwife
of
genius
this
event
filled
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
forever
with
that
contempt
for
men
which
later
was
to
make
her
so
strong
felicite
died
camille
maupin
was
born
she
returned
to
paris
with
conti
the
great
musician
for
whom
she
wrote
the
librettos
of
two
operas
but
she
had
no
more
illusions
and
she
became
at
heart
unknown
to
the
world
a
sort
of
female
don
juan
without
debts
and
without
conquests
encouraged
by
success
she
published
the
two
volumes
of
plays
which
at
once
placed
the
name
of
camille
maupin
in
the
list
of
illustrious
anonymas
next
she
related
her
betrayed
and
deluded
love
in
a
short
novel
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
that
period
this
book
of
a
dangerous
example
was
classed
with
adolphe
a
dreadful
lamentation
the
counterpart
of
which
is
found
in
camille
s
work
the
true
secret
of
her
literary
metamorphosis
and
pseudonym
has
never
been
fully
understood
some
delicate
minds
have
thought
it
lay
in
a
feminine
desire
to
escape
fame
and
remain
obscure
while
offering
a
man
s
name
and
work
to
criticism
in
spite
of
any
such
desire
if
she
had
it
her
celebrity
increased
daily
partly
through
the
influence
of
her
salon
partly
from
her
own
wit
the
correctness
of
her
judgments
and
the
solid
worth
of
her
acquirements
she
became
an
authority
her
sayings
were
quoted
she
could
no
longer
lay
aside
at
will
the
functions
with
which
parisian
society
invested
her
she
came
to
be
an
acknowledged
exception
the
world
bowed
before
the
genius
and
position
of
this
strange
woman
it
recognized
and
sanctioned
her
independence
women
admired
her
mind
men
her
beauty
her
conduct
was
regulated
by
all
social
conventions
her
friendships
seemed
purely
platonic
there
was
moreover
nothing
of
the
female
author
about
her
mademoiselle
des
touches
is
charming
as
a
woman
of
the
world
languid
when
she
pleases
indolent
coquettish
concerned
about
her
toilet
pleased
with
the
airy
nothings
so
seductive
to
women
and
to
poets
she
understands
very
well
that
after
madame
de
stael
there
is
no
place
in
this
century
for
a
sappho
and
that
ninon
could
not
exist
in
paris
without
and
a
voluptuous
court
she
is
the
ninon
of
the
intellect
she
adores
art
and
artists
she
goes
from
the
poet
to
the
musician
from
the
sculptor
to
the
her
heart
is
noble
endowed
with
a
generosity
that
makes
her
a
dupe
so
filled
is
she
with
pity
for
sorrow
filled
also
with
contempt
for
the
prosperous
she
has
lived
since
the
centre
of
a
choice
circle
surrounded
by
tried
friends
who
love
her
tenderly
and
esteem
each
other
far
from
the
noisy
fuss
of
madame
de
stael
far
from
political
strifes
she
jokes
about
camille
maupin
that
junior
of
george
sand
whom
she
calls
her
brother
cain
whose
recent
fame
has
now
eclipsed
her
own
mademoiselle
des
touches
admires
her
fortunate
rival
with
angelic
composure
feeling
no
jealousy
and
no
secret
vexation
until
the
period
when
this
history
begins
she
had
led
as
happy
a
life
as
a
woman
strong
enough
to
protect
herself
can
be
supposed
to
live
from
to
she
had
come
some
five
or
six
times
to
les
touches
her
first
stay
was
after
her
first
disillusion
in
the
house
was
uninhabitable
and
she
sent
her
man
of
business
to
guerande
and
took
a
lodging
for
herself
in
the
village
at
that
time
she
had
no
suspicion
of
her
coming
fame
she
was
sad
she
saw
no
one
she
wanted
as
it
were
to
contemplate
herself
after
her
great
disaster
she
wrote
to
paris
to
have
the
furniture
necessary
for
a
residence
at
les
touches
sent
down
to
her
it
came
by
a
vessel
to
nantes
thence
by
small
boats
to
croisic
from
which
little
place
it
was
transported
not
without
difficulty
over
the
sands
to
les
touches
workmen
came
down
from
paris
and
before
long
she
occupied
les
touches
which
pleased
her
immensely
she
wanted
to
meditate
over
the
events
of
her
life
like
a
cloistered
nun
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
she
returned
to
paris
the
little
town
of
guerande
was
by
this
time
roused
to
diabolical
curiosity
its
whole
talk
was
of
the
asiatic
luxury
displayed
at
les
touches
her
man
of
business
gave
orders
after
her
departure
that
visitors
should
be
admitted
to
view
the
house
they
flocked
from
the
village
of
batz
from
croisic
and
from
savenay
as
well
as
from
guerande
this
public
curiosity
brought
in
an
enormous
sum
to
the
family
of
the
porter
and
gardener
not
less
in
two
years
than
seventeen
francs
after
this
mademoiselle
des
touches
did
not
revisit
les
touches
for
two
years
not
until
her
return
from
italy
on
that
occasion
she
came
by
way
of
croisic
and
was
accompanied
by
conti
it
was
some
time
before
guerande
became
aware
of
her
presence
her
subsequent
apparitions
at
les
touches
excited
comparatively
little
interest
her
parisian
fame
did
not
precede
her
her
man
of
business
alone
knew
the
secret
of
her
writings
and
of
her
connection
with
the
celebrity
of
camille
maupin
but
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
now
writing
the
contagion
of
the
new
ideas
had
made
some
progress
in
guerande
and
several
persons
knew
of
the
dual
form
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
existence
letters
came
to
the
directed
to
camille
maupin
at
les
touches
in
short
the
veil
was
rent
away
in
a
region
so
essentially
catholic
archaic
and
full
of
prejudice
the
singular
life
of
this
illustrious
woman
would
of
course
cause
rumors
some
of
which
as
we
have
seen
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
abbe
grimont
and
alarmed
him
such
a
life
could
never
be
comprehended
in
guerande
in
fact
to
every
mind
it
seemed
unnatural
and
improper
felicite
during
her
present
stay
was
not
alone
in
les
touches
she
had
a
guest
that
guest
was
claude
vignon
a
scornful
and
powerful
writer
who
though
doing
criticism
only
has
found
means
to
give
the
public
and
literature
the
impression
of
a
certain
superiority
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
received
this
writer
for
the
last
seven
years
as
she
had
so
many
other
authors
journalists
artists
and
men
of
the
world
she
knew
his
nerveless
nature
his
laziness
his
utter
penury
his
indifference
and
disgust
for
all
things
and
yet
by
the
way
she
was
now
conducting
herself
she
seemed
inclined
to
marry
him
she
explained
her
conduct
incomprehensible
to
her
friends
in
various
ways
by
ambition
by
the
dread
she
felt
of
a
lonely
old
age
she
wanted
to
confide
her
future
to
a
superior
man
to
whom
her
fortune
would
be
a
and
thus
increase
her
own
importance
in
the
literary
world
with
these
apparent
intentions
she
had
brought
claude
vignon
from
paris
to
les
touches
as
an
eagle
bears
away
a
kid
in
its
talons
to
study
him
and
decide
upon
some
positive
course
but
in
truth
she
was
misleading
both
calyste
and
claude
she
was
not
even
thinking
of
marriage
her
heart
was
in
the
throes
of
the
most
violent
convulsion
that
could
agitate
a
soul
as
strong
as
hers
she
found
herself
the
dupe
of
her
own
mind
too
late
she
saw
life
lighted
by
the
sun
of
love
shining
as
love
shines
in
a
heart
of
twenty
let
us
now
see
camille
s
convent
where
this
was
happening
vii
les
touches
a
few
hundred
yards
from
guerande
the
soil
of
brittany
comes
to
an
end
the
and
the
sandy
dunes
begin
we
descend
into
a
desert
of
sand
which
the
sea
has
left
for
a
margin
between
herself
and
earth
by
a
rugged
road
through
a
ravine
that
has
never
seen
a
carriage
this
desert
contains
waste
tracts
ponds
of
unequal
size
round
the
shores
of
which
the
salt
is
made
on
muddy
banks
and
a
little
arm
of
the
sea
which
separates
the
mainland
from
the
island
of
croisic
geographically
croisic
is
really
a
peninsula
but
as
it
holds
to
brittany
only
by
the
beaches
which
connect
it
with
the
village
of
batz
barren
quicksands
very
difficult
to
cross
it
may
be
more
correct
to
call
it
an
island
at
the
point
where
the
road
from
croisic
to
guerande
turns
off
from
the
main
road
of

by
a
large
garden
remarkable
for
its
trimmed
and
twisted

to
the
shape
of

stripped
of
their
branches
showing
their
reddened
trunks
in
spots
where
the
bark
has
peeled
these
trees
victims
of
hurricanes
growing
against
wind
and
tide
for
them
the
saying
is
literally
true
prepare
the
mind
for
the
strange
and
depressing
sight
of
the
marshes
and
dunes
which
resemble
a
stiffened
ocean
the
house
fairly
well
built
of
a
species
of
slaty
stone
with
granite
courses
has
no
architecture
it
presents
to
the
eye
a
plain
wall
with
windows
at
regular
intervals
these
windows
have
small
leaded
panes
on
the

large
panes
on
the
upper

the
attics
which
stretch
the
whole
length
of

two
gables
and
two
large
dormer
windows
on
each
side
of

under
the
triangular
point
of

this

derives
an
income
from
the

and
a
few
outlying

over
ten
thousand
francs
a

such
is
the
fief
of

from
which
the
revolution
lopped
its
feudal
rights
the

continue
to
call
it
the

and
they
would
still
say
seigneur
if
the
fief
were
not
now
in
the
female
line
when
felicite
set
about
restoring
les
touches
she
was
careful
artist
that
she
is
not
to
change
the
desolate
exterior
which
gives
the
look
of
a
prison
to
the
isolated
structure
the
sole
change
was
at
the
gate
which
she
enlivened
by
two
brick
columns
supporting
an
arch
beneath
which
carriages
pass
into
the
where
she
planted
trees
the
arrangement
of
the
is
that
of
nearly
all
country
houses
built
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
evidently
erected
on
the
ruins
of
some
old
castle
formerly
perched
there
a
large
panelled
has
been
turned
by
felicite
into
a
from
it
opens
an
immense
salon
with
six
windows
and
the
the
kitchen
communicates
with
the
through
an
office
camille
has
displayed
a
noble
simplicity
in
the
arrangement
of
this
floor
carefully
avoiding
all
splendid
decoration
the
salon
painted
gray
is
furnished
in
old
mahogany
with
green
silk
coverings
the
furniture
of
the
comprises
four
great
buffets
also
of
mahogany
chairs
covered
with
horsehair
and
superb
engravings
by
audran
in
mahogany
frames
the
old
staircase
of
wood
with
heavy
balusters
is
covered
all
over
with
a
green
carpet
on
the
floor
above
are
two
suites
of
rooms
separated
by
the
staircase
mademoiselle
des
touches
has
taken
for
herself
the
one
that
looks
toward
the
sea
and
the
marshes
and
arranged
it
with
a
small
salon
a
large
chamber
and
two
cabinets
one
for
a
the
other
for
a
study
and
the
other
suite
she
has
made
into
two
separate
apartments
for
guests
each
with
a
bedroom
an
antechamber
and
a
cabinet
the
servants
have
rooms
in
the
attic
the
rooms
for
guests
are
furnished
with
what
is
strictly
necessary
and
no
more
a
certain
fantastic
luxury
has
been
reserved
for
her
own
apartment
in
that
sombre
and
melancholy
habitation
looking
out
upon
the
sombre
and
melancholy
landscape
she
wanted
the
most
fantastic
creations
of
art
that
she
could
find
the
little
salon
is
hung
with
gobelin
tapestry
framed
in
marvellously
carved
oak
the
windows
are
draped
with
the
heavy
silken
hangings
of
a
past
age
a
brocade
shot
with
crimson
and
gold
against
green
and
yellow
gathered
into
mighty
pleats
and
trimmed
with
fringes
and
cords
and
tassels
worthy
of
a
church
this
salon
contains
a
chest
or
cabinet
worth
in
these
days
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
a
carved
ebony
table
a
secretary
with
many
drawers
inlaid
with
arabesques
of
ivory
and
bought
in
venice
with
other
noble
gothic
furniture
here
too
are
pictures
and
articles
of
choice
workmanship
bought
in
at
a
time
when
no
one
suspected
the
ultimate
value
of
such
treasures
her
bedroom
is
of
the
period
of
louis
xv
and
strictly
exact
to
it
here
we
see
the
carved
wooden
bedstead
painted
white
with
the
arched
surmounted
by
cupids
scattering
flowers
and
the
canopy
above
it
adorned
with
plumes
the
hangings
of
blue
silk
the
pompadour
with
its
laces
and
mirror
together
with
bits
of
furniture
of
singular
shape
a
duchesse
a
a
stiff
little
sofa
with
of
silk
like
that
of
the
furniture
lined
with
pink
satin
and
caught
back
with
silken
ropes
and
a
carpet
of
savonnerie
in
short
we
find
here
all
those
elegant
rich
sumptuous
and
dainty
things
in
the
midst
of
which
the
women
of
the
eighteenth
century
lived
and
made
love
the
study
entirely
of
the
present
day
presents
in
contrast
with
the
louis
xv
gallantries
a
charming
collection
of
mahogany
furniture
it
resembles
a
boudoir
the
bookshelves
are
full
but
the
fascinating
trivialities
of
a
woman
s
existence
encumber
it
in
the
midst
of
which
an
inquisitive
eye
perceives
with
uneasy
surprise
pistols
a
narghile
a
a
hammock
a
rifle
a
man
s
blouse
tobacco
pipes
a
knapsack
a
bizarre
combination
which
paints
felicite
every
great
soul
entering
that
room
would
be
struck
with
the
peculiar
beauty
of
the
landscape
which
spreads
its
broad
savanna
beyond
the
park
the
last
vegetation
on
the
continent
the
melancholy
squares
of
water
divided
by
little
paths
of
white
salt
crust
along
which
the
pass
dressed
in
white
to
rake
up
and
gather
the
salt
into
a
space
which
the
saline
exhalations
prevent
all
birds
from
crossing
stifling
thus
the
efforts
of
botanic
nature
those
sands
where
the
eye
is
soothed
only
by
one
little
hardy
persistent
plant
bearing
rosy
flowers
and
the
chartreux
pansy
that
lake
of
salt
water
the
sandy
dunes
the
view
of
croisic
a
miniature
town
afloat
like
venice
on
the
sea
and
finally
the
mighty
ocean
tossing
its
foaming
fringe
upon
the
granite
rocks
as
if
the
better
to
bring
out
their
weird
formations
that
sight
uplifts
the
mind
although
it
saddens
it
an
effect
produced
at
last
by
all
that
is
sublime
creating
a
regretful
yearning
for
things
unknown
and
yet
perceived
by
the
soul
on
heights
these
wild
and
savage
harmonies
are
for
great
spirits
and
great
sorrows
only
this
desert
scene
where
at
times
the
sun
rays
reflected
by
the
water
by
the
sands
whitened
the
village
of
batz
and
rippled
on
the
roofs
of
croisic
with
pitiless
brilliancy
filled
camille
s
dreaming
mind
for
days
together
she
seldom
looked
to
the
cool
refreshing
scenes
the
groves
the
flowery
meadows
around
guerande
her
soul
was
struggling
to
endure
a
horrible
inward
anguish
no
sooner
did
calyste
see
the
vanes
of
the
two
gables
shooting
up
beyond
the
furze
of
the
roadside
and
the
distorted
heads
of
the
pines
than
the
air
seemed
lighter
guerande
was
a
prison
to
him
his
life
was
at
les
touches
who
will
not
understand
the
attraction
it
presented
to
a
youth
in
his
position
a
love
like
that
of
cherubin
had
flung
him
at
the
feet
of
a
person
who
was
a
great
and
grand
thing
to
him
before
he
thought
of
her
as
a
woman
and
it
had
survived
the
repeated
and
inexplicable
refusals
of
felicite
this
sentiment
which
was
more
the
need
of
loving
than
love
itself
had
not
escaped
the
terrible
power
of
camille
for
analysis
hence
possibly
her
rejection
a
generosity
unperceived
of
course
by
calyste
at
les
touches
were
displayed
to
the
ravished
eyes
of
the
ignorant
young
countryman
the
riches
of
a
new
world
he
heard
as
it
were
another
language
hitherto
unknown
to
him
and
sonorous
he
listened
to
the
poetic
sounds
of
the
finest
music
that
surpassing
music
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
which
melody
and
harmony
blend
or
struggle
on
equal
terms
a
music
in
which
song
and
instrumentation
have
reached
a
hitherto
unknown
perfection
he
saw
before
his
eyes
the
works
of
modern
painters
those
of
the
french
school
the
heir
of
italy
spain
and
flanders
in
which
talent
has
become
so
common
that
hearts
weary
of
talent
are
calling
aloud
for
genius
he
read
there
those
works
of
imagination
those
amazing
creations
of
modern
literature
which
produced
their
full
effect
upon
his
unused
heart
in
short
the
great
nineteenth
century
appeared
to
him
in
all
its
collective
magnificence
its
criticising
spirit
its
desires
for
renovation
in
all
directions
and
its
vast
efforts
nearly
all
of
them
on
the
scale
of
the
giant
who
cradled
the
infancy
of
the
century
in
his
banners
and
sang
to
it
hymns
with
the
lullaby
of
cannon
initiated
by
felicite
into
the
grandeur
of
all
these
things
which
may
perhaps
escape
the
eyes
of
those
who
work
them
calyste
gratified
at
les
touches
the
taste
for
the
glorious
powerful
at
his
age
and
that
artless
admiration
the
first
love
of
adolescence
which
is
always
irritated
by
criticism
it
is
so
natural
that
flame
should
rise
he
listened
to
that
charming
parisian
raillery
that
graceful
satire
which
revealed
to
him
french
wit
and
the
qualities
of
the
french
mind
and
awakened
in
him
a
thousand
ideas
which
might
have
slumbered
forever
in
the
soft
torpor
of
his
family
life
for
him
mademoiselle
des
touches
was
the
mother
of
his
intellect
she
was
so
kind
to
him
a
woman
is
always
adorable
to
a
man
in
whom
she
inspires
love
even
when
she
seems
not
to
share
it
at
the
present
time
felicite
was
giving
him
to
him
the
grand
apartments
on
the
lower
floor
and
her
private
rooms
above
so
coquettish
so
artistic
were
vivified
were
animated
by
a
light
a
spirit
a
supernatural
atmosphere
strange
and
undefinable
the
modern
world
with
its
poesy
was
sharply
contrasted
with
the
dull
and
patriarchal
world
of
guerande
in
the
two
systems
brought
face
to
face
before
him
on
one
side
all
the
thousand
developments
of
art
on
the
other
the
sameness
of
uncivilized
brittany
no
one
will
therefore
ask
why
the
poor
lad
bored
like
his
mother
with
the
pleasures
of
quivered
as
he
approached
the
house
and
rang
the
bell
and
crossed
the
such
emotions
we
may
remark
do
not
assail
a
mature
man
trained
to
the
ups
and
downs
of
life
whom
nothing
surprises
being
prepared
for
all
as
the
door
opened
calyste
hearing
the
sound
of
the
piano
supposed
that
camille
was
in
the
salon
but
when
he
entered
the
he
no
longer
heard
it
camille
he
thought
must
be
playing
on
a
small
upright
piano
brought
by
conti
from
england
and
placed
by
her
in
her
own
little
salon
he
began
to
run
up
the
stairs
where
the
thick
carpet
smothered
the
sound
of
his
steps
but
he
went
more
slowly
as
he
neared
the
top
perceiving
something
unusual
and
extraordinary
about
the
music
felicite
was
playing
for
herself
only
she
was
communing
with
her
own
being
instead
of
entering
the
room
the
young
man
sat
down
upon
a
gothic
seat
covered
with
green
velvet
which
stood
on
the
landing
beneath
a
window
artistically
framed
in
carved
woods
stained
and
varnished
nothing
was
ever
more
mysteriously
melancholy
than
camille
s
improvisation
it
seemed
like
the
cry
of
a
soul
to
god
from
the
depths
of
a
grave
the
heart
of
the
young
lover
recognized
the
cry
of
despairing
love
the
prayer
of
a
hidden
plaint
the
groan
of
repressed
affliction
camille
had
varied
modified
and
lengthened
the
introduction
to
the
cavatina
mercy
for
thee
mercy
for
me
which
is
nearly
the
whole
of
the
fourth
act
of
robert
le
she
now
suddenly
sang
the
words
in
a
manner
and
then
as
suddenly
interrupted
herself
calyste
entered
and
saw
the
reason
poor
camille
maupin
poor
felicite
she
turned
to
him
a
face
bathed
with
tears
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
dried
them
and
said
simply
without
affectation
she
was
beautiful
as
she
sat
there
in
her
morning
gown
on
her
head
was
one
of
those
red
chenille
nets
much
worn
in
those
days
through
which
the
coils
of
her
black
hair
shone
escaping
here
and
there
a
short
upper
garment
made
like
a
greek
peplum
gave
to
view
a
pair
of
cambric
trousers
with
embroidered
frills
and
the
prettiest
of
turkish
slippers
red
and
gold
what
is
the
matter
cried
calyste
he
has
not
returned
she
replied
going
to
a
window
and
looking
out
upon
the
sands
the
sea
and
the
marshes
this
answer
explained
all
camille
was
awaiting
claude
vignon
you
are
anxious
about
him
asked
calyste
yes
she
answered
with
a
sadness
the
lad
was
too
ignorant
to
analyze
he
started
to
leave
the
room
where
are
you
going
she
asked
to
find
him
he
replied
dear
child
she
said
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
toward
her
with
one
of
those
moist
glances
which
are
to
a
youthful
soul
the
best
of
recompenses
you
are
distracted
where
could
you
find
him
on
that
wide
shore
i
will
find
your
mother
would
be
in
mortal
terror
stay
besides
i
choose
it
she
said
making
him
sit
down
upon
the
sofa
don
t
pity
me
the
tears
you
see
are
the
tears
a
woman
likes
to
shed
we
have
a
faculty
that
is
not
in
man
that
of
abandoning
ourselves
to
our
nervous
nature
and
driving
our
feelings
to
an
extreme
by
imagining
certain
situations
and
encouraging
the
imagination
we
end
in
tears
and
sometimes
in
serious
states
of
illness
or
disorder
the
fancies
of
women
are
not
the
action
of
the
mind
they
are
of
the
heart
you
have
come
just
in
time
solitude
is
bad
for
me
i
am
not
the
dupe
of
his
professed
desire
to
go
to
croisic
and
see
the
rocks
and
the
dunes
and
the
without
me
he
meant
to
leave
us
alone
together
he
is
jealous
or
rather
he
pretends
jealousy
and
you
are
young
you
are
why
not
have
told
me
this
before
what
must
i
do
must
i
stay
away
asked
calyste
with
difficulty
restraining
his
tears
one
of
which
rolled
down
his
cheek
and
touched
felicite
deeply
you
are
an
angel
she
cried
then
she
gaily
sang
the
stay
stay
of
matilde
in
guillaume
tell
taking
all
gravity
from
that
magnificent
answer
of
the
princess
to
her
subject
he
only
wants
to
make
me
think
he
loves
me
better
than
he
really
does
she
said
he
knows
how
much
i
desire
his
happiness
she
went
on
looking
attentively
at
calyste
perhaps
he
feels
humiliated
to
be
inferior
to
me
there
perhaps
he
has
suspicions
about
you
and
means
to
surprise
us
but
even
if
his
only
crime
is
to
take
his
pleasure
without
me
and
not
to
associate
me
with
the
ideas
this
new
place
gives
him
is
not
that
enough
ah
i
am
no
more
loved
by
that
great
brain
than
i
was
by
the
musician
by
the
poet
by
the
soldier
sterne
is
right
names
signify
much
mine
is
a
bitter
sarcasm
i
shall
die
without
finding
in
any
man
the
love
which
fills
my
heart
the
poesy
that
i
have
in
my
soul
she
stopped
her
arms
pendant
her
head
lying
back
on
the
cushions
her
eyes
stupid
with
thought
fixed
on
a
pattern
of
the
carpet
the
pain
of
great
minds
has
something
grandiose
and
imposing
about
it
it
reveals
a
vast
extent
of
soul
which
the
thought
of
the
spectator
extends
still
further
such
souls
share
the
privileges
of
royalty
whose
affections
belong
to
a
people
and
so
affect
a
world
why
did
you
reject
my
said
calyste
but
he
could
not
end
his
sentence
camille
s
beautiful
hand
laid
upon
his
eloquently
interrupted
him
nature
changed
her
laws
in
granting
me
a
dozen
years
of
youth
beyond
my
due
she
said
i
rejected
your
love
from
egotism
sooner
or
later
the
difference
in
our
ages
must
have
parted
us
i
am
thirteen
years
older
than
and
even
that
is
too
you
will
be
beautiful
at
sixty
cried
calyste
heroically
god
grant
it
she
answered
smiling
besides
dear
child
i
to
love
in
spite
of
his
cold
heart
his
lack
of
imagination
his
cowardly
indifference
and
the
envy
which
consumes
him
i
believe
there
is
greatness
behind
those
tatters
i
hope
to
galvanize
that
heart
to
save
him
from
himself
to
attach
him
to
me
alas
alas
i
have
a
mind
but
a
blind
she
was
terrible
in
her
knowledge
of
herself
she
suffered
and
analyzed
her
feelings
as
cuvier
and
dupuytren
explained
to
friends
the
fatal
advance
of
their
disease
and
the
progress
that
death
was
making
in
their
bodies
camille
maupin
knew
the
passion
within
her
as
those
men
of
science
knew
their
own
anatomy
i
have
brought
him
here
to
judge
him
and
he
is
already
bored
she
continued
he
pines
for
paris
i
tell
him
the
nostalgia
of
criticism
is
on
him
he
has
no
author
to
pluck
no
system
to
undermine
no
poet
to
drive
to
despair
and
he
dares
not
commit
some
debauch
in
this
house
which
might
lift
for
a
moment
the
burden
of
his
ennui
alas
my
love
is
not
real
enough
perhaps
to
soothe
his
brain
i
don
t
intoxicate
him
make
him
drunk
at
dinner
and
i
shall
know
if
i
am
right
i
will
say
i
am
ill
and
stay
in
my
own
calyste
turned
scarlet
from
his
neck
to
his
forehead
even
his
ears
were
on
fire
oh
forgive
me
she
cried
how
can
i
heedlessly
deprave
your
girlish
innocence
forgive
me
calyste
she
paused
there
are
some
superb
consistent
natures
who
say
at
a
certain
age
if
i
had
my
life
to
live
over
again
i
would
do
the
same
i
who
do
not
think
myself
weak
i
say
i
would
be
a
woman
like
your
mother
to
have
a
calyste
oh
what
happiness
i
could
be
a
humble
and
submissive
woman
and
yet
i
have
done
no
harm
except
to
myself
but
alas
dear
child
a
woman
can
not
stand
alone
in
society
except
it
be
in
what
is
called
a
primitive
state
affections
which
are
not
in
harmony
with
social
or
with
natural
laws
affections
that
are
not
obligatory
in
short
escape
us
suffering
for
suffering
as
well
be
useful
where
we
can
what
care
i
for
those
children
of
my
cousin
faucombe
i
have
not
seen
them
these
twenty
years
and
they
are
married
to
merchants
you
are
my
son
who
have
never
cost
me
the
miseries
of
motherhood
i
shall
leave
you
my
fortune
and
make
you
happy
at
least
so
far
as
money
can
do
so
dear
treasure
of
beauty
and
grace
that
nothing
should
ever
change
or
you
would
not
take
my
love
said
calyste
and
i
shall
return
your
fortune
to
your
child
answered
camille
in
a
guttural
voice
letting
the
tears
roll
down
her
cheeks
will
nothing
save
me
from
myself
she
added
presently
you
said
you
had
a
history
to
tell
me
and
a
letter
to

the
generous
youth
wishing
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
her
grief
but
she
did
not
let
him
finish
you
are
right
to
remind
me
of
that
i
will
be
an
honest
woman
before
all
else
i
will
sacrifice
no
one
yes
it
was
too
late
yesterday
but
we
have
time
she
said
in
a
cheerful
tone
i
will
keep
my
promise
and
while
i
tell
you
that
history
i
will
sit
by
the
window
and
watch
the
road

a
great

and
opened

of

shared
the
oriental
taste
of
her

a
magnificent
persian

she

the
yellow
leaves
placing
the
vase
with
its
long
neck
enamelled
in
blue
and
gold
at
some
distance
from
her
and
rang
the
bell
for
tea
will
you
have
cigarettes
ah
i
am
always
forgetting
that
you
do
not
smoke
purity
such
as
yours

so
rare
the
hand
of

herself
fresh
from

hand
of
her

is
alone
innocent
enough
to
stroke
your
calyste
colored
sitting
down
on

stool
at

did
not

the
deep
emotion
that
seemed
for
a
moment
to
overcome
her
viii

i
promised
you
this
tale
of
the
past
and
here
it
is
said
camille

person
from
whom
i
received
that
letter
yesterday
and
who
may
be
here
is
the
marquise
de
rochefide
the
old
marquis
whose
family
is
not
as
old
as
yours
after
marrying
his
eldest
daughter
to
a
portuguese
grandee
was
anxious
to
find
an
alliance
among
the
higher
nobility
for
his
son
in
order
to
obtain
for
him
the
peerage
he
had
never
been
able
to
get
for
himself
the

him
of
a
young
lady
in
the
department
of

years
old
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
in
she
was
remarkable
for
what
you
provincials
call
originality
which
is
simply
independence
of
ideas
enthusiasm
a
feeling
for
the
beautiful
and
a
certain
impulse
and
ardor
toward
the
things
of
art
you
may
believe
a
poor
woman
who
has
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
along
the
same
lines
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
for
a
woman
if
she
follows
them
they
lead
her
where
you
see
me
and
where
the
marquise
came
to
the
verge
of
abysses
men
alone
have
the
staff
on
which
to
lean
as
they
skirt
those
precipices
a
force
which
is
lacking
to
most
women
but
which
if
we
do
possess
it
makes
abnormal
beings
of
us
her
old
grandmother
the
dowager
de
casteran
was
well
pleased
to
see
her
marry
a
man
to
whom
she
was
superior
in
every
way
the
rochefides
were
equally
satisfied
with
the
casterans
who
connected
them
with
the
verneuils
the
d
esgrignons
the
troisvilles
and
gave
them
a
peerage
for
their
son
in
that
last
big
batch
of
peers
made
by
charles
but
revoked
by
the
revolution
of
july
the
first
days
of
marriage
are
perilous
for
little
minds
as
well
as
for
great
loves
rochefide
being
a
fool
mistook
his
wife
s
ignorance
for
coldness
he
classed
her
among
frigid
lymphatic
women
and
made
that
an
excuse
to
return
to
his
bachelor
life
relying
on
the
coldness
of
the
marquise
her
pride
and
the
thousand
barriers
that
the
life
of
a
great
lady
sets
up
about
a
woman
in
paris
you
ll
know
what
i
mean
when
you
go
there
people
said
to
rochefide
you
are
very
lucky
to
possess
a
cold
wife
who
will
never
have
any
but
head
passions
she
will
always
be
content
if
she
can
shine
her
fancies
are
purely
artistic
her
desires
will
be
satisfied
if
she
can
make
a
salon
and
collect
about
her
distinguished
minds
her
debauches
will
be
in
music
and
her
orgies
rochefide
however
is
not
an
ordinary
fool
he
has
as
much
conceit
and
vanity
as
a
clever
man
which
gives
him
a
mean
and
squinting
jealousy
brutal
when
it
comes
to
the
surface
lurking
and
cowardly
for
six
months
and
murderous
the
seventh
he
thought
he
was
deceiving
his
wife
and
yet
he
feared
her
two
causes
for
tyranny
when
the
day
came
on
which
the
marquise
let
him
see
that
she
was
charitably
assuming
indifference
to
his
unfaithfulness
i
analyze
all
this
in
order
to
explain
her
conduct
beatrix
had
the
keenest
admiration
for
me
there
is
but
one
step
however
from
admiration
to
jealousy
i
have
one
of
the
most
remarkable
salons
in
paris
she
wished
to
make
herself
another
and
in
order
to
do
so
she
attempted
to
draw
away
my
circle
i
don
t
know
how
to
keep
those
who
wish
to
leave
me
she
obtained
the
superficial
people
who
are
friends
with
every
one
from
mere
want
of
occupation
and
whose
object
is
to
get
out
of
a
salon
as
soon
as
they
have
entered
it
but
she
did
not
have
time
to
make
herself
a
real
society
in
those
days
i
thought
her
consumed
with
a
desire
for
celebrity
of
one
kind
or
another
nevertheless
she
has
really
much
grandeur
of
soul
a
regal
pride
distinct
ideas
and
a
marvellous
facility
for
apprehending
and
understanding
all
things
she
can
talk
metaphysics
and
music
theology
and
painting
you
will
see
her
as
a
mature
woman
what
the
rest
of
us
saw
her
as
a
bride
and
yet
there
is
something
of
affectation
about
her
in
all
this
she
has
too
much
the
air
of
knowing
abstruse
things
chinese
hebrew
hieroglyphics
perhaps
or
the
papyrus
that
they
wrapped
round
mummies
personally
beatrix
is
one
of
those
blondes
beside
whom
eve
the
fair
would
seem
a
negress
she
is
slender
and
straight
and
white
as
a
church
taper
her
face
is
long
and
pointed
the
skin
is
capricious
like
cambric
darkened
with
little
speckles
beneath
its
surface
as
if
her
blood
had
left
a
deposit
of
dust
there
during
the
night
her
forehead
is
magnificent
though
rather
daring
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
are
pale
floating
on
their
white
balls
under
thin
lashes
and
lazy
eyelids
her
eyes
have
dark
rings
around
them
often
her
nose
which
describes
of
a
circle
is
pinched
about
the
nostrils
very
shrewd
and
clever
but
supercilious
she
has
an
austrian
mouth
the
upper
lip
has
more
character
than
the
lower
which
drops
disdainfully
her
pale
cheeks
have
no
color
unless
some
very
keen
emotion
moves
her
her
chin
is
rather
fat
mine
is
not
thin
and
perhaps
i
do
wrong
to
tell
you
that
women
with
fat
chins
are
exacting
in
love
she
has
one
of
the
most
exquisite
waists
i
ever
saw
the
shoulders
are
beautiful
but
the
bust
has
not
developed
as
well
and
the
arms
are
thin
she
has
however
an
easy
carriage
and
manner
which
redeems
all
such
defects
and
sets
her
beauties
in
full
relief
nature
has
given
her
that
princess
air
which
can
never
be
acquired
it
becomes
her
and
reveals
at
sudden
moments
the
woman
of
high
birth
without
being
faultlessly
beautiful
or
prettily
pretty
she
produces
when
she
chooses
ineffaceable
impressions
she
has
only
to
put
on
a
gown
of
cherry
velvet
with
clouds
of
lace
and
wreathe
with
roses
that
angelic
hair
of
hers
which
resembles
floods
of
light
and
she
becomes
divine
if
on
some
excuse
or
other
she
could
wear
the
costume
of
the
time
when
women
had
long
pointed
bodices
rising
slim
and
slender
from
voluminous
brocaded
skirts
with
folds
so
heavy
that
they
stood
alone
and
could
hide
her
arms
in
those
wadded
sleeves
with
ruffles
from
which
the
hand
comes
out
like
a
pistil
from
a
calyx
and
could
fling
back
the
curls
of
her
head
into
the
jewelled
knot
behind
her
head
beatrix
would
hold
her
own
victoriously
with
ideal
beauties
like
and
felicite
showed
calyste
a
fine
copy
of
a
picture
by
mieris
in
which
was
a
woman
robed
in
white
satin
standing
with
a
paper
in
her
hand
and
singing
with
a
brabancon
seigneur
while
a
negro
beside
them
poured
golden
spanish
wine
into
a
goblet
and
the
old
housekeeper
in
the
background
arranged
some
biscuits
fair
women
blonds
said
camille
have
the
advantage
over
us
poor
brown
things
of
a
precious
diversity
there
are
a
hundred
ways
for
a
blonde
to
charm
and
only
one
for
a
brunette
besides
blondes
are
more
womanly
we
are
too
like
men
we
french
brunettes
well
well
she
cried
pray
don
t
fall
in
love
with
beatrix
from
the
portrait
i
am
making
of
her
like
that
prince
i
forget
his
name
in
the
arabian
nights
you
would
be
too
late
my
dear
these
words
were
said
pointedly
the
admiration
depicted
on
the
young
man
s
face
was
more
for
the
picture
than
for
the
painter
whose
was
failing
of
its
purpose
as
she
spoke
felicite
was
employing
all
the
resources
of
her
eloquent
physiognomy
blond
as
she
is
however
she
went
on
beatrix
has
not
the
grace
of
her
color
her
lines
are
severe
she
is
elegant
but
hard
her
face
has
a
harsh
contour
though
at
times
it
reveals
a
soul
with
southern
passions
an
angel
flashes
out
and
then
expires
her
eyes
are
thirsty
she
looks
best
when
seen
full
face
the
profile
has
an
air
of
being
squeezed
between
two
doors
you
will
see
if
i
am
mistaken
i
will
tell
you
now
what
made
us
intimate
friends
for
three
years
from
to
beatrix
while
enjoying
the
last
fetes
of
the
restoration
making
the
round
of
the
salons
going
to
court
taking
part
in
the
of
the
was
all
the
while
judging
men
and
things
events
and
life
itself
from
the
height
of
her
own
thought
her
mind
was
busy
these
first
years
of
the
bewilderment
the
world
caused
her
prevented
her
heart
from
waking
up
from
to
she
spent
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
disturbance
at
her
husband
s
where
she
was
bored
like
a
saint
in
paradise
on
her
return
to
paris
she
became
convinced
perhaps
justly
that
the
revolution
of
july
in
the
minds
of
some
persons
purely
political
would
prove
to
be
a
moral
revolution
the
social
class
to
which
she
belonged
not
being
able
during
its
triumph
in
the
fifteen
years
of
the
restoration
to
reconstruct
itself
was
about
to
go
to
pieces
bit
by
bit
under
the
of
the
bourgeoisie
she
heard
the
famous
words
of
monsieur
laine
kings
are
departing
this
conviction
i
believe
was
not
without
its
influence
on
her
conduct
she
took
an
intellectual
part
in
the
new
doctrines
which
swarmed
during
the
three
years
succeeding
july
like
gnats
in
the
sunshine
and
turned
some
female
heads
but
like
all
nobles
beatrix
while
thinking
these
novel
ideals
superb
wanted
always
to
protect
the
nobility
finding
before
long
that
there
was
no
place
in
this
new
regime
for
individual
superiority
seeing
that
the
higher
nobility
were
beginning
once
more
the
mute
opposition
it
had
formerly
made
to
napoleon
which
was
in
truth
its
wisest
course
under
an
empire
of
deeds
and
facts
but
which
in
an
epoch
of
moral
causes
was
equivalent
to
abdication
she
chose
personal
happiness
rather
than
such
eclipse
about
the
time
we
were
all
beginning
to
breathe
again
beatrix
met
at
my
house
a
man
with
whom
i
had
expected
to
end
my
days
gennaro
conti
the
great
composer
a
man
of
neapolitan
origin
though
born
in
marseilles
conti
has
a
brilliant
mind
as
a
composer
he
has
talent
though
he
will
never
attain
to
the
first
rank
without
rossini
without
meyerbeer
he
might
perhaps
have
been
taken
for
a
man
of
genius
he
has
one
advantage
over
those
men
he
is
in
vocal
music
what
paganini
is
on
the
violin
liszt
on
the
piano
taglioni
in
the
ballet
and
what
the
famous
garat
was
at
any
rate
he
recalls
that
great
singer
to
those
who
knew
him
his
is
not
a
voice
my
friend
it
is
a
soul
when
its
song
replies
to
certain
ideas
certain
states
of
feeling
difficult
to
describe
in
which
a
woman
sometimes
finds
herself
that
woman
is
lost
the
marquise
conceived
the
maddest
passion
for
him
and
took
him
from
me
the
act
was
provincial
i
allow
but
it
was
all
fair
play
she
won
my
esteem
and
friendship
by
the
way
she
behaved
to
me
she
thought
me
a
woman
who
was
likely
to
defend
her
own
she
did
not
know
that
to
me
the
most
ridiculous
thing
in
the
world
is
such
a
struggle
she
came
to
see
me
that
woman
proud
as
she
is
was
so
in
love
that
she
told
me
her
secret
and
made
me
the
arbiter
of
her
destiny
she
was
really
adorable
and
she
kept
her
place
as
woman
and
as
marquise
in
my
eyes
i
must
tell
you
dear
friend
that
while
women
are
sometimes
bad
they
have
hidden
grandeurs
in
their
souls
that
men
can
never
appreciate
well
as
i
seem
to
be
making
my
last
will
and
testament
like
a
woman
on
the
verge
of
old
age
i
shall
tell
you
that
i
was
ever
faithful
to
conti
and
should
have
been
till
death
and
yet
i
his
nature
is
charming
apparently
and
detestable
beneath
its
surface
he
is
a
charlatan
in
matters
of
the
heart
there
are
some
men
like
nathan
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
to
you
who
are
charlatans
externally
and
yet
honest
such
men
lie
to
themselves
mounted
on
their
stilts
they
think
they
are
on
their
feet
and
perform
their
jugglery
with
a
sort
of
innocence
their
humbuggery
is
in
their
blood
they
are
born
comedians
braggarts
extravagant
in
form
as
a
chinese
vase
perhaps
they
even
laugh
at
themselves
their
personality
is
generous
like
murat
s
kingly
garments
it
attracts
danger
but
conti
s
duplicity
will
be
known
only
to
the
women
who
love
him
in
his
art
he
has
that
deep
italian
jealousy
which
led
the
carlone
to
murder
piola
and
stuck
a
stiletto
into
paesiello
that
terrible
envy
lurks
beneath
the
warmest
comradeship
conti
has
not
the
courage
of
his
vice
he
smiles
at
meyerbeer
and
flatters
him
when
he
fain
would
tear
him
to
bits
he
knows
his
weakness
and
cultivates
an
appearance
of
sincerity
his
vanity
still
further
leads
him
to
play
at
sentiments
which
are
far
indeed
from
his
real
heart
he
represents
himself
as
an
artist
who
receives
his
inspirations
from
heaven
art
is
something
saintly
and
sacred
to
him
he
is
fanatic
he
is
sublime
in
his
contempt
for
worldliness
his
eloquence
seems
to
come
from
the
deepest
convictions
he
is
a
seer
a
demon
a
god
an
angel
calyste
although
i
warn
you
about
him
you
will
be
his
dupe
that
southern
nature
that
impassioned
artist
is
cold
as
a
listen
to
him
the
artist
is
a
missionary
art
is
a
religion
which
has
its
priests
and
ought
to
have
its
martyrs
once
started
on
that
theme
gennaro
reaches
the
most
dishevelled
pathos
that
any
german
professor
of
philosophy
ever
spluttered
to
his
audience
you
admire
his
convictions
but
he
hasn
t
any
bearing
his
hearers
to
heaven
on
a
song
which
seems
a
mysterious
fluid
shedding
love
he
casts
an
ecstatic
glance
upon
them
he
is
examining
their
enthusiasm
he
is
asking
himself
am
i
really
a
god
to
them
and
he
is
also
thinking
i
ate
too
much
macaroni
he
is
insatiable
of
applause
and
he
wins
it
he
delights
he
is
beloved
he
is
admired
whensoever
he
will
he
owes
his
success
more
to
his
voice
than
to
his
talent
as
a
composer
though
he
would
rather
be
a
man
of
genius
like
rossini
than
a
performer
like
rubini
i
had
committed
the
folly
of
attaching
myself
to
him
and
i
was
determined
and
resigned
to
deck
this
idol
to
the
end
conti
like
a
great
many
artists
is
dainty
in
all
his
ways
he
likes
his
ease
his
enjoyments
he
is
always
carefully
even
elegantly
dressed
i
do
respect
his
courage
he
is
brave
bravery
they
say
is
the
only
virtue
into
which
hypocrisy
can
not
enter
while
we
were
travelling
i
saw
his
courage
tested
he
risked
the
life
he
loved
and
yet
strange
contradiction
i
have
seen
him
in
paris
commit
what
i
call
the
cowardice
of
thought
my
friend
all
this
was
known
to
me
i
said
to
the
poor
marquise
you
don
t
know
into
what
a
gulf
you
are
plunging
you
are
the
perseus
of
a
poor
andromeda
you
release
me
from
my
rock
if
he
loves
you
so
much
the
better
but
i
doubt
it
he
loves
no
one
but
gennaro
was
transported
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
pride
i
was
not
a
marquise
i
was
not
born
a
casteran
and
he
forgot
me
in
a
day
i
then
gave
myself
the
savage
pleasure
of
probing
that
nature
to
the
bottom
certain
of
the
result
i
wanted
to
see
the
twistings
and
turnings
conti
would
perform
my
dear
child
i
saw
in
one
week
actual
horrors
of
sham
sentiment
infamous
buffooneries
of
feeling
i
will
not
tell
you
about
them
you
shall
see
the
man
here
in
a
day
or
two
he
now
knows
that
i
know
him
and
he
hates
me
accordingly
if
he
could
stab
me
with
safety
to
himself
i
shouldn
t
be
alive
two
seconds
i
have
never
said
one
word
of
all
this
to
beatrix
the
last
and
constant
insult
geranno
offers
me
is
to
suppose
that
i
am
capable
of
communicating
my
sad
knowledge
of
him
to
her
but
he
has
no
belief
in
the
good
feeling
of
any
human
being
even
now
he
is
playing
a
part
with
me
he
is
posing
as
a
man
who
is
wretched
at
having
left
me
you
will
find
what
i
may
call
the
most
penetrating
cordiality
about
him
he
is
winning
he
is
chivalrous
to
him
all
women
are
madonnas
one
must
live
with
him
long
before
we
get
behind
the
veil
of
this
false
chivalry
and
learn
the
invisible
signs
of
his
humbug
his
tone
of
conviction
about
himself
might
almost
deceive
the
deity
you
will
be
entrapped
my
dear
child
by
his
catlike
manners
and
you
will
never
believe
in
the
profound
and
rapid
arithmetic
of
his
inmost
thought
but
enough
let
us
leave
him
i
pushed
indifference
so
far
as
to
receive
them
together
in
my
house
this
circumstance
kept
that
most
perspicacious
of
all
societies
the
great
world
of
paris
ignorant
of
the
affair
though
intoxicated
with
pride
gennaro
was
compelled
to
dissimulate
and
he
did
it
admirably
but
violent
passions
will
have
their
freedom
at
any
cost
before
the
end
of
the
year
beatrix
whispered
in
my
ear
one
evening
my
dear
felicite
i
start
for
italy
with
i
was
not
surprised
she
regarded
herself
as
united
for
life
to
gennaro
and
she
suffered
from
the
restraints
imposed
upon
her
she
escaped
one
evil
by
rushing
into
a
greater
conti
was
wild
with
happiness
the
happiness
of
vanity
alone
that
s
what
it
is
to
love
truly
he
said
to
me
how
many
women
are
there
who
would
sacrifice
their
lives
their
fortune
their
reputation
yes
she
loves
you
i
replied
but
you
do
not
love
he
was
furious
and
made
me
a
scene
he
stormed
he
declaimed
he
depicted
his
love
declaring
that
he
had
never
supposed
it
possible
to
love
as
much
i
remained
impassible
and
lent
him
money
for
his
journey
which
being
unexpected
found
him
unprepared
beatrix
left
a
letter
for
her
husband
and
started
the
next
day
for
italy
there
she
has
remained
two
years
she
has
written
to
me
several
times
and
her
letters
are
enchanting
the
poor
child
attaches
herself
to
me
as
the
only
woman
who
will
comprehend
her
she
says
she
adores
me
want
of
money
has
compelled
gennaro
to
accept
an
offer
to
write
a
french
opera
he
does
not
find
in
italy
the
pecuniary
gains
which
composers
obtain
in
paris
here
s
the
letter
i
received
yesterday
from
beatrix
take
it
and
read
it
you
can
now
understand
it
that
is
if
it
is
possible
at
your
age
to
analyze
the
things
of
the
so
saying
she
held
out
the
letter
to
him
at
this
moment
claude
vignon
entered
the
room
at
his
unexpected
apparition
calyste
and
felicite
were
both
silent
for
a
moment
she
from
surprise
he
from
a
vague
uneasiness
the
vast
forehead
broad
and
high
of
the
who
was
bald
at
the
age
of
now
seemed
darkened
by
annoyance
his
firm
judicial
mouth
expressed
a
habit
of
chilling
sarcasm
claude
vignon
is
imposing
in
spite
of
the
precocious
deteriorations
of
a
face
once
magnificent
and
now
grown
haggard
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
he
strongly
resembled
the
divine
raffaelle
but
his
nose
that
feature
of
the
human
face
that
changes
most
is
growing
to
a
point
the
countenance
is
sinking
into
mysterious
depressions
the
outlines
are
thickening
leaden
tones
predominate
in
the
complexion
giving
tokens
of
weariness
although
the
fatigues
of
this
young
man
are
not
apparent
perhaps
some
bitter
solitude
has
aged
him
or
the
abuse
of
his
gift
of
comprehension
he
scrutinizes
the
thought
of
every
one
yet
without
definite
aim
or
system
the
pickaxe
of
his
criticism
demolishes
it
never
constructs
thus
his
lassitude
is
that
of
a
mechanic
not
of
an
architect
the
eyes
of
a
pale
blue
once
brilliant
are
clouded
now
by
some
hidden
pain
or
dulled
by
gloomy
sadness
excesses
have
laid
dark
tints
above
the
eyelids
the
temples
have
lost
their
freshness
the
chin
of
incomparable
distinction
is
getting
doubled
but
without
dignity
his
voice
never
sonorous
is
weakening
without
being
either
hoarse
or
extinct
it
touches
the
confines
of
hoarseness
and
extinction
the
impassibility
of
that
fine
head
the
fixity
of
that
glance
cover
irresolution
and
weakness
which
the
keenly
intelligent
and
sarcastic
smile
belies
the
weakness
lies
wholly
in
action
not
in
thought
there
are
traces
of
an
encyclopedic
comprehension
on
that
brow
and
in
the
habitual
movement
of
a
face
that
is
childlike
and
splendid
both
the
man
is
tall
slightly
bent
already
like
all
those
who
bear
the
weight
of
a
world
of
thought
such
long
tall
bodies
are
never
remarkable
for
continuous
effort
or
creative
activity
charlemagne
belisarious
and
constantine
are
noted
exceptions
to
this
rule
certainly
claude
vignon
presents
a
variety
of
mysteries
to
be
solved
in
the
first
place
he
is
very
simple
and
very
wily
though
he
falls
into
excesses
with
the
readiness
of
a
courtesan
his
powers
of
thought
remain
untouched
yet
his
intellect
which
is
competent
to
criticise
art
science
literature
and
politics
is
incompetent
to
guide
his
external
life
claude
contemplates
himself
within
the
domain
of
his
intellectual
kingdom
and
abandons
his
outer
man
with
diogenic
indifference
satisfied
to
penetrate
all
to
comprehend
all
by
thought
he
despises
materialities
and
yet
if
it
becomes
a
question
of
creating
doubt
assails
him
he
sees
obstacles
he
is
not
inspired
by
beauties
and
while
he
is
debating
means
he
sits
with
his
arms
pendant
accomplishing
nothing
he
is
the
turk
of
the
intellect
made
somnolent
by
meditation
criticism
is
his
opium
his
harem
of
books
to
read
disgusts
him
with
real
work
indifferent
to
small
things
as
well
as
great
things
he
is
sometimes
compelled
by
the
very
weight
of
his
head
to
fall
into
a
debauch
and
abdicate
for
a
few
hours
the
fatal
power
of
omnipotent
analysis
he
is
far
too
preoccupied
with
the
wrong
side
of
genius
and
camille
maupin
s
desire
to
put
him
back
on
the
right
side
is
easily
conceivable
the
task
was
an
attractive
one
claude
vignon
thinks
himself
a
great
politician
as
well
as
a
great
writer
but
this
unpublished
machiavelli
laughs
within
himself
at
all
ambitions
he
knows
what
he
can
do
he
has
instinctively
taken
the
measure
of
his
future
on
his
faculties
he
sees
his
greatness
but
he
also
sees
obstacles
grows
alarmed
or
disgusted
lets
the
time
roll
by
and
does
not
go
to
work
like
etienne
lousteau
the
feuilletonist
like
nathan
the
dramatic
author
like
blondet
another
journalist
he
came
from
the
ranks
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
which
we
owe
the
greater
number
of
our
writers
which
way
did
you
come
asked
mademoiselle
des
touches
coloring
with
either
pleasure
or
by
the
door
replied
claude
vignon
dryly
oh
she
cried
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
am
aware
that
you
are
not
a
man
to
climb
in
by
a
scaling
a
window
is
a
badge
of
honor
for
a
beloved
enough
said
felicite
am
i
in
the
way
asked
claude
monsieur
said
calyste
artlessly
this
letter
pray
keep
it
i
ask
no
questions
at
our
age
we
understand
such
affairs
he
answered
interrupting
calyste
with
a
sardonic
air
but
monsieur
began
calyste
much
provoked
calm
yourself
young
man
i
have
the
utmost
indulgence
for
my
dear
calyste
said
camille
wishing
to
speak
dear
said
vignon
interrupting
her
claude
is
joking
said
camille
continuing
her
remarks
to
calyste
he
is
wrong
to
do
it
with
you
who
know
nothing
of
parisian
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
joking
said
claude
vignon
very
gravely
which
way
did
you
come
asked
felicite
again
i
have
been
watching
the
road
to
croisic
for
the
last
two
not
all
the
time
replied
vignon
you
are
too
bad
to
jest
in
this
am
i
jesting
calyste
rose
why
should
you
go
so
soon
you
are
certainly
at
your
ease
here
said
vignon
quite
the
contrary
replied
the
angry
young
breton
to
whom
camille
maupin
stretched
out
a
hand
which
he
took
and
kissed
dropping
a
tear
upon
it
after
which
he
took
his
leave
i
should
like
to
be
that
little
young
man
said
the
critic
sitting
down
and
taking
one
end
of
the
hookah
how
he
will
love
too
much
for
then
he
will
not
be
loved
in
return
replied
mademoiselle
des
touches
madame
de
rochefide
is
coming
here
she
added
you
don
t
say
so
exclaimed
claude
with
conti
she
will
stay
here
alone
but
he
accompanies
have
they
quarrelled
play
me
a
sonata
of
beethoven
s
i
know
nothing
of
the
music
he
wrote
for
the
claude
began
to
fill
the
tube
of
the
hookah
with
turkish
tobacco
all
the
while
examining
camille
much
more
attentively
than
she
observed
a
dreadful
thought
oppressed
him
he
fancied
he
was
being
used
for
a
blind
by
this
woman
the
situation
was
a
novel
one
calyste
went
home
thinking
no
longer
of
beatrix
de
rochefide
and
her
letter
he
was
furious
against
claude
vignon
for
what
he
considered
the
utmost
indelicacy
and
he
pitied
poor
felicite
how
was
it
possible
to
be
beloved
by
that
sublime
creature
and
not
adore
her
on
his
knees
not
believe
her
on
the
faith
of
a
glance
or
a
smile
he
felt
a
desire
to
turn
and
rend
that
cold
pale
spectre
of
a
man
ignorant
he
might
be
as
felicite
had
told
him
of
the
tricks
of
thought
of
the
jesters
of
the
press
but
one
thing
he
knew
love
was
the
human
religion
when
his
mother
saw
him
entering
the
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
zephirine
whistled
for
mariotte
mariotte
the
boy
is
coming
cook
the
fish
i
see
him
mademoiselle
replied
the
woman
fanny
uneasy
at
the
sadness
she
saw
on
her
son
s
brow
picked
up
her
the
old
aunt
took
out
her
knitting
the
baron
gave
his
to
his
son
and
walked
about
the
room
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
before
going
out
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
no
flemish
or
dutch
picture
ever
presented
an
interior
in
tones
more
mellow
peopled
with
faces
and
forms
so
harmoniously
blending
the
handsome
young
man
in
his
black
velvet
coat
the
mother
still
so
beautiful
and
the
aged
brother
and
sister
framed
by
that
ancient
hall
were
a
moving
domestic
harmony
fanny
would
fain
have
questioned
calyste
but
he
had
already
pulled
a
letter
from
his
pocket
that
letter
of
the
marquise
beatrix
which
was
perhaps
destined
to
destroy
the
happiness
of
this
noble
family
as
he
unfolded
it
calyste
s
awakened
imagination
showed
him
the
marquise
dressed
as
camille
maupin
had
fancifully
depicted
her
from
the
marquise
de
rochefide
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
genoa
july
i
have
not
written
to
you
since
our
stay
in
florence
my
dear
friend
for
venice
and
rome
have
absorbed
my
time
and
as
you
know
happiness
occupies
a
large
part
of
life
so
far
we
have
neither
of
us
dropped
from
its
first
level
i
am
a
little
fatigued
for
when
one
has
a
soul
not
easy
to
the
constant
succession
of
enjoyments
naturally
causes
lassitude
our
friend
has
had
a
magnificent
triumph
at
the
scala
and
the
fenice
and
now
at
the
san
carlo
three
italian
operas
in
two
years
you
can
not
say
that
love
has
made
him
idle
we
have
been
warmly
received
everywhere
though
i
myself
would
have
preferred
solitude
and
silence
surely
that
is
the
only
suitable
manner
of
life
for
women
who
have
placed
themselves
in
direct
opposition
to
society
i
expected
such
a
life
but
love
my
dear
friend
is
a
more
exacting
master
than
marriage
however
it
is
sweet
to
obey
him
though
i
did
not
think
i
should
have
to
see
the
world
again
even
by
snatches
and
the
attentions
i
receive
are
so
many
stabs
i
am
no
longer
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
highest
rank
of
women
and
the
more
attentions
are
paid
to
me
the
more
my
inferiority
is
made
apparent
gennaro
could
not
comprehend
this
sensitiveness
but
he
has
been
so
happy
that
it
would
ill
become
me
not
to
have
sacrificed
my
petty
vanity
to
that
great
and
noble
thing
the
life
of
an
artist
we
women
live
by
love
whereas
men
live
by
love
and
action
otherwise
they
would
not
be
men
still
there
are
great
disadvantages
for
a
woman
in
the
position
in
which
i
have
put
myself
you
have
escaped
them
you
continue
to
be
a
person
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
which
has
no
rights
over
you
you
have
your
own
free
will
and
i
have
lost
mine
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
things
of
the
heart
not
those
of
social
life
which
i
have
utterly
renounced
you
can
be
coquettish
and
and
have
all
the
graces
of
a
woman
who
loves
a
woman
who
can
give
or
refuse
her
love
as
she
pleases
you
have
kept
the
right
to
have
caprices
in
the
interests
even
of
your
love
in
short
you
still
possess
your
right
of
feeling
while
i
i
have
no
longer
any
liberty
of
heart
which
i
think
precious
to
exercise
in
love
even
though
the
love
itself
may
be
eternal
i
have
no
right
now
to
that
privilege
of
quarrelling
in
jest
to
which
so
many
women
cling
and
justly
for
is
it
not
the
plummet
line
with
which
to
sound
the
hearts
of
men
i
have
no
threat
at
my
command
i
must
draw
my
power
henceforth
from
obedience
from
unlimited
gentleness
i
must
make
myself
imposing
by
the
greatness
of
my
love
i
would
rather
die
than
leave
gennaro
and
my
pardon
lies
in
the
sanctity
of
my
love
between
social
dignity
and
my
petty
personal
dignity
i
did
right
not
to
hesitate
if
at
times
i
have
a
few
melancholy
feelings
like
clouds
that
pass
through
a
clear
blue
sky
and
to
which
all
women
like
to
yield
themselves
i
keep
silence
about
them
they
might
seem
like
regrets
ah
me
i
have
so
fully
understood
the
obligations
of
my
position
that
i
have
armed
myself
with
the
utmost
indulgence
but
so
far
gennaro
has
not
alarmed
my
susceptible
jealousy
i
don
t
as
yet
see
where
that
dear
great
genius
may
fail
dear
angel
i
am
like
those
pious
souls
who
argue
with
their
god
for
are
not
you
my
providence
do
i
not
owe
my
happiness
to
you
you
must
never
doubt
therefore
that
you
are
constantly
in
my
thoughts
i
have
seen
italy
at
last
seen
it
as
you
saw
it
and
as
it
ought
to
be
seen
lighted
to
our
souls
by
love
as
it
is
by
its
own
bright
sun
and
its
masterpieces
i
pity
those
who
being
moved
to
adoration
at
every
step
have
no
hand
to
press
no
heart
in
which
to
shed
the
exuberance
of
emotions
which
calm
themselves
when
shared
these
two
years
have
been
to
me
a
lifetime
in
which
my
memory
has
stored
rich
harvests
have
you
made
plans
as
i
do
to
stay
forever
at
chiavari
to
buy
a
palazzo
in
venice
a
at
sorrento
a
villa
in
florence
all
loving
women
dread
society
but
i
who
am
cast
forever
outside
of
it
ought
i
not
to
bury
myself
in
some
beautiful
landscape
on
flowery
slopes
facing
the
sea
or
in
a
valley
that
equals
a
sea
like
that
of
fiesole
but
alas
we
are
only
poor
artists
and
want
of
money
is
bringing
these
two
bohemians
back
to
paris
gennaro
does
not
want
me
to
feel
that
i
have
lost
my
luxury
and
he
wishes
to
put
his
new
work
a
grand
opera
into
rehearsal
at
once
you
will
understand
of
course
my
dearest
that
i
can
not
set
foot
in
paris
i
could
not
i
would
not
even
if
it
costs
me
my
love
meet
one
of
those
glances
of
women
or
of
men
which
would
make
me
think
of
murder
or
suicide
yes
i
could
hack
in
pieces
whoever
insulted
me
with
pity
like
chateauneuf
who
in
the
time
of
henri
i
think
rode
his
horse
at
the
provost
of
paris
for
a
wrong
of
that
kind
and
trampled
him
under
hoof
i
write
therefore
to
say
that
i
shall
soon
pay
you
a
visit
at
les
touches
i
want
to
stay
there
in
that
chartreuse
while
awaiting
the
success
of
our
gennaro
s
opera
you
will
see
that
i
am
bold
with
my
benefactress
my
sister
but
i
prove
at
any
rate
that
the
greatness
of
obligations
laid
upon
me
has
not
led
me
as
it
does
so
many
people
to
ingratitude
you
have
told
me
so
much
of
the
difficulties
of
the
land
journey
that
i
shall
go
to
croisic
by
water
this
idea
came
to
me
on
finding
that
there
is
a
little
danish
vessel
now
here
laden
with
marble
which
is
to
touch
at
croisic
for
a
cargo
of
salt
on
its
way
back
to
the
baltic
i
shall
thus
escape
the
fatigue
and
the
cost
of
the
land
journey
dear
felicite
you
are
the
only
person
with
whom
i
could
be
alone
without
conti
will
it
not
be
some
pleasure
to
have
a
woman
with
you
who
understands
your
heart
as
fully
as
you
do
hers
adieu
the
wind
is
favorable
and
i
set
sail
wafting
you
a
kiss
beatrix
ah
she
loves
too
thought
calyste
folding
the
letter
sadly
that
sadness
flowed
to
the
heart
of
the
mother
as
if
some
gleam
had
lighted
up
a
gulf
to
her
the
baron
had
gone
out
fanny
went
to
the
door
of
the
tower
and
pushed
the
bolt
then
she
returned
and
leaned
upon
the
back
of
her
boy
s
chair
like
the
sister
of
dido
in
guerin
s
picture
and
said
what
is
it
my
calyste
what
makes
you
so
sad
you
promised
to
explain
to
me
these
visits
to
les
touches
i
am
to
bless
its
mistress
at
least
you
said
yes
indeed
you
will
dear
mother
he
replied
she
has
shown
me
the
insufficiency
of
my
education
at
an
epoch
when
the
nobles
ought
to
possess
a
personal
value
in
order
to
give
life
to
their
rank
i
was
as
far
from
the
age
we
live
in
as
guerande
is
from
paris
she
has
been
as
it
were
the
mother
of
my
i
can
not
bless
her
for
that
said
the
baroness
with
tears
in
her
eyes
mamma
cried
calyste
on
whose
forehead
those
hot
tears
fell
two
pearls
of
sorrowful
motherhood
mamma
don
t
weep
just
now
when
i
wanted
to
do
her
a
service
and
search
the
country
round
she
said
it
will
make
your
mother
so
did
she
say
that
then
i
can
forgive
her
many
things
replied
fanny
felicite
thinks
only
of
my
good
continued
calyste
she
often
checks
the
lively
venturesome
language
of
artists
so
as
not
to
shake
me
in
a
faith
which
is
though
she
knows
it
not
unshakable
she
has
told
me
of
the
life
in
paris
of
several
young
men
of
the
highest
nobility
coming
from
their
provinces
as
i
might
do
leaving
families
without
fortune
but
obtaining
in
paris
by
the
power
of
their
will
and
their
intellect
a
great
career
i
can
do
what
the
baron
de
rastignac
now
a
minister
of
state
has
done
felicite
has
taught
me
i
read
with
her
she
gives
me
lessons
on
the
piano
she
is
teaching
me
italian
she
has
initiated
me
into
a
thousand
social
secrets
about
which
no
one
in
guerande
knows
anything
at
all
she
could
not
give
me
the
treasures
of
her
love
but
she
has
given
me
those
of
her
vast
intellect
her
mind
her
genius
she
does
not
want
to
be
a
pleasure
but
a
light
to
me
she
lessens
not
one
of
my
faiths
she
herself
has
faith
in
the
nobility
she
loves
brittany
she
she
has
changed
our
calyste
said
his
blind
old
aunt
interrupting
him
i
do
not
understand
one
word
he
has
been
saying
you
have
a
solid
roof
over
your
head
my
good
nephew
you
have
parents
and
relations
who
adore
you
and
faithful
servants
you
can
marry
some
good
little
breton
girl
religious
and
accomplished
who
will
make
you
happy
reserve
your
ambitions
for
your
eldest
son
who
may
be
four
times
as
rich
as
you
if
you
choose
to
live
tranquilly
thriftily
in
obscurity
but
in
the
peace
of
god
in
order
to
release
the
burdens
on
your
estate
it
is
all
as
simple
as
a
breton
heart
you
will
be
not
so
rapidly
perhaps
but
more
solidly
a
rich
your
aunt
is
right
my
darling
she
plans
for
your
happiness
with
as
much
anxiety
as
i
do
myself
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
marrying
you
to
my
niece
margaret
the
daughter
of
your
uncle
lord
fitzwilliam
it
is
almost
certain
that
mademoiselle
de
will
leave
her
fortune
to
whichever
of
her
nieces
you
may
and
besides
there
s
a
little
gold
to
be
found
here
added
the
old
aunt
in
a
low
voice
with
a
mysterious
glance
about
her
marry
at
my
age
he
said
casting
on
his
mother
one
of
those
looks
which
melt
the
arguments
of
mothers
am
i
to
live
without
my
beautiful
fond
loves
must
i
never
tremble
or
throb
or
fear
or
gasp
or
lie
beneath
implacable
looks
and
soften
them
am
i
never
to
know
beauty
in
its
freedom
the
fantasy
of
the
soul
the
clouds
that
course
through
the
azure
of
happiness
which
the
breath
of
pleasure
dissipates
ah
shall
i
never
wander
in
those
sweet
moist
with
dew
never
stand
beneath
the
drenching
of
a
gutter
and
not
know
it
rains
like
those
lovers
seen
by
diderot
never
take
like
the
duc
de
lorraine
a
live
coal
in
my
hand
are
there
no
silken
ladders
for
me
no
rotten
trellises
to
cling
to
and
not
fall
shall
i
know
nothing
of
woman
but
conjugal
submission
nothing
of
love
but
the
flame
of
its
are
my
longings
to
be
satisfied
before
they
are
roused
must
i
live
out
my
days
deprived
of
that
madness
of
the
heart
that
makes
a
man
and
his
power
would
you
make
me
a
married
monk
no
i
have
eaten
of
the
fruit
of
parisian
civilization
do
you
not
see
that
you
have
by
the
ignorant
morals
of
this
family
prepared
the
fire
that
consumes
me
that
consume
me
utterly
unless
i
can
adore
the
divineness
i
see
everywhere
in
those
sands
gleaming
in
the
sun
in
the
green
foliage
in
all
the
women
beautiful
noble
elegant
pictured
in
the
books
and
in
the
poems
i
have
read
with
camille
alas
there
is
but
one
such
woman
in
guerande
and
it
is
you
my
mother
the
birds
of
my
beautiful
dream
they
come
from
paris
they
fly
from
the
pages
of
scott
of
byron
parisina
effie
minna
yes
and
that
royal
duchess
whom
i
saw
on
the
moors
among
the
furze
and
the
ferns
whose
very
aspect
sent
the
blood
to
my
the
baroness
saw
these
thoughts
flaming
in
the
eyes
of
her
son
clearer
more
beautiful
more
living
than
art
can
tell
to
those
who
read
them
she
grasped
them
rapidly
flung
to
her
as
they
were
in
glances
like
arrows
from
an
upset
quiver
without
having
read
beaumarchais
she
felt
as
other
women
would
have
felt
that
it
would
be
a
crime
to
marry
calyste
oh
my
child
she
said
taking
him
in
her
arms
and
kissing
the
beautiful
hair
that
was
still
hers
marry
whom
you
will
and
when
you
will
but
be
happy
my
part
in
life
is
not
to
hamper
mariotte
came
to
lay
the
table
gasselin
was
out
exercising
calyste
s
horse
which
the
youth
had
not
mounted
for
two
months
the
three
women
mother
aunt
and
mariotte
shared
in
the
tender
feminine
wiliness
which
taught
them
to
make
much
of
calyste
when
he
dined
at
home
breton
plainness
fought
against
parisian
luxury
now
brought
to
the
very
doors
of
guerande
mariotte
endeavored
to
wean
her
young
master
from
the
accomplished
service
of
camille
maupin
s
kitchen
just
as
his
mother
and
aunt
strove
to
hold
him
in
the
net
of
their
tenderness
and
render
all
comparison
impossible
there
s
a
for
dinner
monsieur
calyste
and
snipe
and
pancakes
such
as
i
know
you
can
t
get
anywhere
but
here
said
mariotte
with
a
sly
triumphant
look
as
she
smoothed
the
cloth
a
cascade
of
snow
after
dinner
when
the
old
aunt
had
taken
up
her
knitting
and
the
rector
and
monsieur
du
halga
had
arrived
allured
by
their
precious
calyste
went
back
to
les
touches
on
the
pretext
of
returning
the
letter
claude
vignon
and
felicite
were
still
at
table
the
great
critic
was
something
of
a
gourmand
and
felicite
pampered
the
vice
knowing
how
indispensable
a
woman
makes
herself
by
such
compliance
the
presented
that
rich
and
brilliant
aspect
which
modern
luxury
aided
by
the
perfecting
of
handicrafts
now
gives
to
its
service
the
poor
and
noble
house
of
guenic
little
knew
with
what
an
adversary
it
was
attempting
to
compete
or
what
amount
of
fortune
was
necessary
to
enter
the
lists
against
the
silverware
the
delicate
porcelain
the
beautiful
linen
the
service
brought
from
paris
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
the
science
of
her
cook
calyste
declined
the
liqueurs
contained
in
one
of
those
superb
cases
of
precious
woods
which
are
something
like
tabernacles
here
s
the
letter
he
said
with
innocent
ostentation
looking
at
claude
who
was
slowly
sipping
a
glass
of
well
what
did
you
think
of
it
asked
mademoiselle
des
touches
throwing
the
letter
across
the
table
to
vignon
who
began
to
read
it
taking
up
and
putting
down
at
intervals
his
little
glass
i
thought
well
that
parisian
women
were
very
fortunate
to
have
men
of
genius
to
adore
who
adore
ah
you
are
still
in
your
village
said
felicite
laughing
what
did
you
not
see
that
she
loves
him
less
and
that
is
evident
said
claude
vignon
who
had
only
read
the
first
page
do
people
reason
on
their
situation
when
they
really
love
are
they
as
shrewd
as
the
marquise
as
observing
as
discriminating
your
dear
beatrix
is
held
to
conti
now
by
pride
only
she
is
condemned
to
love
him
poor
woman
said
camille
calyste
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
table
he
saw
nothing
about
him
the
beautiful
woman
in
the
fanciful
dress
described
that
morning
by
felicite
appeared
to
him
crowned
with
light
she
smiled
to
him
she
waved
her
fan
the
other
hand
issuing
from
its
ruffle
of
lace
fell
white
and
pure
on
the
heavy
folds
of
her
crimson
velvet
robe
she
is
just
the
thing
for
you
said
claude
vignon
smiling
sardonically
at
calyste
the
young
man
was
deeply
wounded
by
the
words
and
by
the
manner
in
which
they
were
said
don
t
put
such
ideas
into
calyste
s
mind
you
don
t
know
how
dangerous
such
jokes
may
prove
to
be
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
hastily
i
know
beatrix
and
there
is
something
too
grandiose
in
her
nature
to
allow
her
to
change
besides
conti
will
be
ha
said
claude
vignon
satirically
a
slight
touch
of
jealousy
eh
can
you
really
think
so
said
camille
haughtily
you
are
more
perspicacious
than
a
mother
replied
claude
vignon
still
sarcastically
but
it
would
be
impossible
said
camille
looking
at
calyste
they
are
very
well
matched
remarked
vignon
she
is
ten
years
older
than
he
and
it
is
he
who
appears
to
be
the
girl
a
girl
monsieur
said
calyste
waking
from
his
reverie
who
has
been
twice
under
fire
in
la
vendee
if
the
cause
had
had
twenty
thousand
more
such
girls
i
was
giving
you
some
praise
and
that
is
easier
than
to
give
you
a
beard
remarked
vignon
i
have
a
sword
for
those
who
wear
their
beards
too
long
cried
calyste
and
i
am
very
good
at
an
epigram
said
the
other
smiling
we
are
frenchmen
the
affair
can
easily
be
mademoiselle
des
touches
cast
a
supplicating
look
on
calyste
which
calmed
him
instantly
why
said
felicite
as
if
to
break
up
the
discussion
do
young
men
like
my
calyste
begin
by
loving
women
of
a
certain
age
i
don
t
know
any
sentiment
more
artless
or
more
generous
replied
vignon
it
is
the
natural
consequence
of
the
adorable
qualities
of
youth
besides
how
would
old
women
end
if
it
were
not
for
such
love
you
are
young
and
beautiful
and
will
be
for
twenty
years
to
come
so
i
can
speak
of
this
matter
before
you
he
added
with
a
keen
look
at
mademoiselle
des
touches
in
the
first
place
the
to
whom
young
men
pay
their
first
court
know
much
better
how
to
make
love
than
younger
women
an
adolescent
youth
is
too
like
a
young
woman
himself
for
a
young
woman
to
please
him
such
a
passion
trenches
on
the
fable
of
narcissus
besides
that
feeling
of
repugnance
there
is
as
i
think
a
mutual
sense
of
inexperience
which
separates
them
the
reason
why
the
hearts
of
young
women
are
only
understood
by
mature
men
who
conceal
their
cleverness
under
a
passion
real
or
feigned
is
precisely
the
same
allowing
for
the
difference
of
minds
as
that
which
renders
a
woman
of
a
certain
age
more
adroit
in
attracting
youth
a
young
man
feels
that
he
is
sure
to
succeed
with
her
and
the
vanities
of
the
woman
are
flattered
by
his
suit
besides
isn
t
it
natural
for
youth
to
fling
itself
on
fruits
the
autumn
of
a
woman
s
life
offers
many
that
are
very
toothsome
those
looks
for
instance
bold
and
yet
reserved
bathed
with
the
last
rays
of
love
so
warm
so
sweet
that
elegance
of
speech
those
magnificent
shoulders
so
nobly
developed
the
full
and
undulating
outline
the
dimpled
hands
the
hair
so
well
arranged
so
cared
for
that
charming
nape
of
the
neck
where
all
the
resources
of
art
are
displayed
to
exhibit
the
contrast
between
the
hair
and
the
and
to
set
in
full
relief
the
exuberance
of
life
and
love
brunettes
themselves
are
fair
at
such
times
with
the
amber
colors
of
maturity
besides
such
women
reveal
in
their
smiles
and
display
in
their
words
a
knowledge
of
the
world
they
know
how
to
converse
they
can
call
up
the
whole
of
social
life
to
make
a
lover
laugh
their
dignity
and
their
pride
are
stupendous
or
in
other
moods
they
can
utter
despairing
cries
which
touch
his
soul
farewells
of
love
which
they
take
care
to
render
useless
and
only
make
to
intensify
his
passion
their
devotions
are
absolute
they
listen
to
us
they
love
us
they
catch
they
cling
to
love
as
a
man
condemned
to
death
clings
to
the
veriest
trifles
of
existence
in
short
love
absolute
love
is
known
only
through
them
i
think
such
women
can
never
be
forgotten
by
a
man
any
more
than
he
can
forget
what
is
grand
and
sublime
a
young
woman
has
a
thousand
distractions
these
women
have
none
no
longer
have
they
pettiness
or
vanity
their
love
it
is
the
loire
at
its
mouth
it
is
vast
it
is
swelled
by
all
the
illusions
all
the
affluents
of
life
and
this
is
why
but
my
muse
is
dumb
he
added
observing
the
ecstatic
attitude
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
was
pressing
calyste
s
hand
with
all
her
strength
perhaps
to
thank
him
for
having
been
the
occasion
of
such
a
moment
of
such
an
eulogy
so
lofty
that
she
did
not
see
the
trap
that
it
laid
for
her
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
claude
vignon
and
felicite
sparkled
with
wit
and
happy
sayings
they
told
anecdotes
and
described
parisian
life
to
calyste
who
was
charmed
with
claude
for
mind
has
immense
seductions
for
persons
who
are
all
heart
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
to
see
the
marquise
de
rochefide
and
conti
who
of
course
will
accompany
her
at
the
said
claude
vignon
as
the
evening
ended
when
i
was
at
croisic
this
afternoon
the
fishermen
were
saying
that
they
had
seen
a
little
vessel
danish
swedish
or
norwegian
in
the
this
speech
brought
a
flush
to
the
cheeks
of
the
impassible
camille
again
madame
du
guenic
sat
up
till
one
o
clock
that
night
waiting
for
her
son
unable
to
imagine
why
he
should
stay
so
late
if
mademoiselle
des
touches
did
not
love
him
he
must
be
in
their
way
said
this
adorable
mother
what
were
you
talking
about
she
asked
when
at
last
he
came
in
oh
mother
i
have
never
before
spent
such
a
delightful
evening
genius
is
a
great
a
sublime
thing
why
didn
t
you
give
me
genius
with
genius
we
can
make
our
lives
we
can
choose
among
all
women
the
woman
to
love
and
she
must
be
how
handsome
you
are
my
calyste
claude
vignon
is
handsome
men
of
genius
have
luminous
foreheads
and
eyes
through
which
the
lightnings
flash
but
i
alas
i
know
nothing
only
to
they
say
that
suffices
my
angel
she
said
kissing
him
on
the
forehead
do
you
believe
it
they
say
so
but
i
have
never
known
calyste
kissed
his
mother
s
hand
as
if
it
was
a
sacred
thing
i
will
love
you
for
all
those
that
would
have
adored
you
he
said
dear
child
perhaps
it
is
a
little
bit
your
duty
to
do
so
for
you
inherit
my
nature
but
calyste
do
not
be
unwise
imprudent
try
to
love
only
noble
women
if
love
you
ix
a
first
meeting
what
young
man
full
of
abounding
but
restrained
life
and
emotion
would
not
have
had
the
glorious
idea
of
going
to
croisic
to
see
madame
de
rochefide
land
and
examine
her
incognito
calyste
greatly
surprised
his
father
and
mother
by
going
off
in
the
morning
without
waiting
for
the
breakfast
heaven
knows
with
what
agility
the
young
breton
s
feet
sped
along
some
unknown
vigor
seemed
lent
to
him
he
walked
on
air
gliding
along
by
the
walls
of
les
touches
that
he
might
not
be
seen
from
the
house
the
adorable
boy
was
ashamed
of
his
ardor
and
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
felicite
and
vignon
were
so
perspicacious
besides
in
such
cases
young
fellows
fancy
that
their
foreheads
are
transparent
he
reached
the
shore
strengthened
by
a
stone
embankment
at
the
foot
of
which
is
a
house
where
travellers
can
take
shelter
in
storms
of
wind
or
rain
it
is
not
always
possible
to
cross
the
little
arm
of
the
sea
which
separates
the
of
guerande
from
croisic
the
weather
may
be
bad
or
the
boats
not
ready
and
during
this
time
of
waiting
it
is
necessary
to
put
not
only
the
passengers
but
their
horses
donkeys
baggages
and
merchandise
under
cover
calyste
presently
saw
two
boats
coming
over
from
croisic
laden
with
baggage
trunks
packages
bags
and
chests
the
shape
and
appearance
of
which
proved
to
a
native
of
these
parts
that
such
extraordinary
articles
must
belong
to
travellers
of
distinction
in
one
of
the
boats
was
a
young
woman
in
a
straw
bonnet
with
a
green
veil
accompanied
by
a
man
this
boat
was
the
first
to
arrive
calyste
trembled
until
on
closer
view
he
saw
they
were
a
maid
and
a
are
you
going
over
to
croisic
monsieur
calyste
said
one
of
the
boatmen
to
whom
he
replied
with
a
shake
of
the
head
annoyed
at
being
called
by
his
name
he
was
captivated
by
the
sight
of
a
chest
covered
with
tarred
cloth
on
which
were
painted
the
words
mme
la
marquise
de
rochefide
the
name
shone
before
him
like
a
talisman
he
fancied
there
was
something
fateful
in
it
he
knew
in
some
mysterious
way
which
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
should
love
that
woman
why
in
the
burning
desert
of
his
new
and
infinite
desires
still
vague
and
without
an
object
his
fancy
fastened
with
all
its
strength
on
the
first
woman
that
presented
herself
beatrix
necessarily
inherited
the
love
which
camille
had
rejected
calyste
watched
the
landing
of
the
luggage
casting
from
time
to
time
a
glance
at
croisic
from
which
he
hoped
to
see
another
boat
put
out
to
cross
to
the
little
promontory
and
show
him
beatrix
already
to
his
eyes
what
beatrice
was
to
dante
a
marble
statue
on
which
to
hang
his
garlands
and
his
flowers
he
stood
with
arms
folded
lost
in
meditation
here
is
a
fact
worthy
of
remark
which
nevertheless
has
never
been
remarked
we
often
subject
ourselves
to
sentiments
by
our
own
volition
deliberately
bind
ourselves
and
create
our
own
fate
chance
has
not
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
we
believe
i
don
t
see
any
horses
said
the
maid
sitting
on
a
trunk
and
i
don
t
see
any
road
said
the
footman
horses
have
been
here
though
replied
the
woman
pointing
to
the
proofs
of
their
presence
monsieur
she
said
addressing
calyste
is
this
really
the
way
to
guerande
yes
he
replied
are
you
expecting
some
one
to
meet
you
we
were
told
that
they
would
fetch
us
from
les
touches
if
they
don
t
come
she
added
to
the
footman
i
don
t
know
how
madame
la
marquise
will
manage
to
dress
for
dinner
you
had
better
go
and
find
mademoiselle
des
touches
oh
what
a
land
of
savages
calyste
had
a
vague
idea
of
having
blundered
is
your
mistress
going
to
les
touches
he
inquired
she
is
there
mademoiselle
came
for
her
this
morning
at
seven
o
clock
ah
here
come
the
calyste
started
toward
guerande
with
the
lightness
and
agility
of
a
chamois
doubling
like
a
hare
that
he
might
not
return
upon
his
tracks
or
meet
any
of
the
servants
of
les
touches
he
did
however
meet
two
of
them
on
the
narrow
causeway
of
the
marsh
along
which
he
went
shall
i
go
in
or
shall
i
not
he
thought
when
the
pines
of
les
touches
came
in
sight
he
was
afraid
and
continued
his
way
rather
sulkily
to
guerande
where
he
finished
his
excursion
on
the
mall
and
continued
his
reflections
she
has
no
idea
of
my
agitation
he
said
to
himself
his
capricious
thoughts
were
so
many
grapnels
which
fastened
his
heart
to
the
marquise
he
had
known
none
of
these
mysterious
terrors
and
joys
in
his
intercourse
with
camille
such
vague
emotions
rise
like
poems
in
the
untutored
soul
warmed
by
the
first
fires
of
imagination
souls
like
his
have
been
known
to
pass
through
all
phases
of
preparation
and
to
reach
in
silence
and
solitude
the
very
heights
of
love
without
having
met
the
object
of
so
many
efforts
presently
calyste
saw
coming
toward
him
the
chevalier
du
halga
and
mademoiselle
de
who
were
walking
together
on
the
mall
he
heard
them
say
his
name
and
he
slipped
aside
out
of
sight
but
not
out
of
hearing
the
chevalier
and
the
old
maid
believing
themselves
alone
were
talking
aloud
if
charlotte
de
kergarouet
comes
said
the
chevalier
keep
her
four
or
five
months
how
can
you
expect
her
to
coquette
with
calyste
she
is
never
here
long
enough
to
undertake
it
whereas
if
they
see
each
other
every
day
those
two
children
will
fall
in
love
and
you
can
marry
them
next
winter
if
you
say
two
words
about
it
to
charlotte
she
ll
say
four
to
calyste
and
a
girl
of
sixteen
can
certainly
carry
off
the
prize
from
a
woman
of
here
the
old
people
turned
to
retrace
their
steps
and
calyste
heard
no
more
but
remembering
what
his
mother
had
told
him
he
saw
mademoiselle
de
s
intention
and
in
the
mood
in
which
he
then
was
nothing
could
have
been
more
fatal
the
mere
idea
of
a
girl
thus
imposed
upon
him
sent
him
with
greater
ardor
into
his
imaginary
love
he
had
never
had
a
fancy
for
charlotte
de
kergarouet
and
he
now
felt
repugnance
at
the
very
thought
of
her
calyste
was
quite
unaffected
by
questions
of
fortune
from
infancy
he
had
accustomed
his
life
to
the
poverty
and
the
restricted
means
of
his
father
s
house
a
young
man
brought
up
as
he
had
been
and
now
partially
emancipated
was
likely
to
consider
sentiments
only
and
all
his
sentiments
all
his
thought
now
belonged
to
the
marquise
in
presence
of
the
portrait
which
camille
had
drawn
for
him
of
her
friend
what
was
that
little
charlotte
the
companion
of
his
childhood
whom
he
thought
of
as
a
sister
he
did
not
go
home
till
five
in
the
afternoon
as
he
entered
the
hall
his
mother
gave
him
with
a
rather
sad
smile
the
following
letter
from
mademoiselle
des
touches
my
dear
calyste
the
beautiful
marquise
has
come
we
count
on
you
to
help
us
celebrate
her
arrival
claude
always
sarcastic
declares
that
you
will
play
bice
and
that
she
will
be
dante
it
is
for
our
honor
as
bretons
and
yours
as
a
du
guenic
to
welcome
a
casteran
come
soon
your
friend
camille
maupin
come
as
you
are
without
ceremony
otherwise
you
will
put
us
to
the
blush
calyste
gave
the
letter
to
his
mother
and
departed
who
are
the
casterans
said
fanny
to
the
baron
an
old
norman
family
allied
to
william
the
conqueror
he
replied
they
bear
on
a
shield
tierce
fessed
azure
gules
and
sable
a
horse
rearing
argent
shod
with
gold
that
beautiful
creature
for
whom
the
gars
was
killed
at
fougeres
in
was
the
daughter
of
a
casteran
who
made
herself
a
nun
and
became
an
abbess
after
the
duc
de
verneuil
deserted
and
the
rochefides
i
don
t
know
that
name
i
should
have
to
see
the
blazon
he
replied
the
baroness
was
somewhat
reassured
on
hearing
that
the
marquise
de
rochefide
was
born
of
a
noble
family
but
she
felt
that
her
son
was
now
exposed
to
new
seductions
calyste
as
he
walked
along
felt
all
sorts
of
violent
and
yet
soft
inward
movements
his
throat
was
tight
his
heart
swelled
his
brain
was
full
a
fever
possessed
him
he
tried
to
walk
slowly
but
some
superior
power
hurried
him
this
impetuosity
of
the
several
senses
excited
by
vague
expectation
is
known
to
all
young
men
a
subtle
fire
flames
within
their
breasts
and
darts
outwardly
about
them
like
the
rays
of
a
nimbus
around
the
heads
of
divine
personages
in
works
of
religious
art
through
it
they
see
all
nature
glorious
and
woman
radiant
are
they
not
then
like
those
haloed
saints
full
of
faith
hope
ardor
purity
the
young
breton
found
the
company
assembled
in
the
little
salon
of
camille
s
suite
of
rooms
it
was
then
about
six
o
clock
the
sun
in
setting
cast
through
the
windows
its
ruddy
light
chequered
by
the
trees
the
air
was
still
twilight
beloved
of
women
was
spreading
through
the
room
here
comes
the
future
deputy
of
brittany
said
camille
maupin
smiling
as
calyste
raised
the
tapestry
portiere
punctual
as
a
you
recognized
his
step
just
now
said
claude
to
felicite
in
a
low
voice
calyste
bowed
low
to
the
marquise
who
returned
the
salutation
with
an
inclination
of
her
head
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
he
took
the
hand
claude
vignon
held
out
to
him
and
pressed
it
this
is
the
celebrated
man
of
whom
we
have
talked
so
much
gennaro
conti
said
camille
not
replying
to
claude
vignon
s
remark
she
presented
to
calyste
a
man
of
medium
height
thin
and
slender
with
chestnut
hair
eyes
that
were
almost
red
and
a
white
skin
freckled
here
and
there
whose
head
was
so
precisely
the
head
of
lord
byron
though
rather
better
carried
on
his
shoulders
that
description
is
superfluous
conti
was
rather
proud
of
this
resemblance
i
am
fortunate
he
said
to
meet
monsieur
du
guenic
during
the
one
day
that
i
spend
at
les
it
was
for
me
to
say
that
to
you
replied
calyste
with
a
certain
ease
he
is
handsome
as
an
angel
said
the
marquise
in
an
under
tone
to
felicite
standing
between
the
sofa
and
the
two
ladies
calyste
heard
the
words
confusedly
he
seated
himself
in
an
and
looked
furtively
toward
the
marquise
in
the
soft
he
saw
reclining
on
a
divan
as
if
a
sculptor
had
placed
it
there
a
white
and
serpentine
shape
which
thrilled
him
without
being
aware
of
it
felicite
had
done
her
friend
a
service
the
marquise
was
much
superior
to
the
unflattered
portrait
camille
had
drawn
of
her
the
night
before
was
it
to
do
honor
to
the
guest
that
beatrix
had
wound
into
her
hair
those
tufts
of
that
gave
value
to
the
pale
tints
of
her
creped
curls
so
arranged
as
to
fall
around
her
face
and
play
upon
the
cheeks
the
circle
of
her
eyes
which
showed
fatigue
was
of
the
purest
her
skin
was
as
dazzling
as
the
eyes
and
beneath
its
whiteness
delicate
as
the
satiny
lining
of
an
egg
life
abounded
in
the
beautiful
blue
veins
the
delicacy
of
the
features
was
extreme
the
forehead
seemed
diaphanous
the
head
so
sweet
and
fragrant
admirably
joined
to
a
long
neck
of
exquisite
moulding
lent
itself
to
many
and
most
diverse
expressions
the
waist
which
could
be
spanned
by
the
hands
had
a
charming
willowy
ease
the
bare
shoulders
sparkled
in
the
twilight
like
a
white
camellia
the
throat
visible
to
the
eye
though
covered
with
a
transparent
fichu
allowed
the
graceful
outlines
of
the
bosom
to
be
seen
with
charming
roguishness
a
gown
of
white
muslin
strewn
with
blue
flowers
made
with
very
large
sleeves
a
pointed
body
and
no
belt
shoes
with
strings
crossed
on
the
instep
over
scotch
thread
stockings
showed
a
charming
knowledge
of
the
art
of
dress
of
silver
filagree
miracles
of
genoese
jewelry
destined
no
doubt
to
become
the
fashion
were
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
delightful
flow
of
the
soft
curls
starred
with
calyste
s
eager
eye
took
in
these
beauties
at
a
glance
and
carved
them
on
his
soul
the
fair
beatrix
and
the
dark
felicite
might
have
sat
for
those
contrasting
portraits
in
keepsakes
which
english
designers
and
engravers
seek
so
persistently
here
were
the
force
and
the
feebleness
of
womanhood
in
full
development
a
perfect
antithesis
these
two
women
could
never
be
rivals
each
had
her
own
empire
here
was
the
delicate
campanula
or
the
lily
beside
the
scarlet
poppy
a
turquoise
near
a
ruby
in
a
moment
as
it
were
at
first
sight
as
the
saying
is
calyste
was
seized
with
a
love
which
crowned
the
secret
work
of
his
hopes
his
fears
his
uncertainties
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
awakened
his
nature
beatrix
inflamed
both
his
heart
and
thoughts
the
young
breton
suddenly
felt
within
him
a
power
to
conquer
all
things
and
yield
to
nothing
that
stood
in
his
way
he
looked
at
conti
with
an
envious
gloomy
savage
rivalry
he
had
never
felt
for
claude
vignon
he
employed
all
his
strength
to
control
himself
but
the
inward
tempest
went
down
as
soon
as
the
eyes
of
beatrix
turned
to
him
and
her
soft
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
dinner
was
announced
calyste
give
your
arm
to
the
marquise
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
taking
conti
with
her
right
hand
and
claude
vignon
with
her
left
and
drawing
back
to
let
the
marquise
pass
the
descent
of
that
ancient
staircase
was
to
calyste
like
the
moment
of
going
into
battle
for
the
first
time
his
heart
failed
him
he
had
nothing
to
say
a
slight
sweat
pearled
upon
his
forehead
and
wet
his
back
his
arm
trembled
so
much
that
as
they
reached
the
lowest
step
the
marquise
said
to
him
is
anything
the
matter
oh
he
replied
in
a
muffled
tone
i
have
never
seen
any
woman
so
beautiful
as
you
except
my
mother
and
i
am
not
master
of
my
but
you
have
camille
maupin
before
your
ah
what
a
difference
said
calyste
ingenuously
calyste
whispered
felicite
who
was
just
behind
him
did
i
not
tell
you
that
you
would
forget
me
as
if
i
had
never
existed
sit
there
she
said
aloud
beside
the
marquise
on
her
right
and
you
claude
on
her
left
as
for
you
gennaro
i
retain
you
by
me
we
will
keep
a
mutual
eye
on
their
the
peculiar
accept
which
camille
gave
to
the
last
word
struck
claude
vignon
s
ear
and
he
cast
that
sly
but
look
upon
camille
which
always
denoted
in
him
the
closest
observation
he
never
ceased
to
examine
mademoiselle
des
touches
throughout
the
dinner
coquetries
replied
the
marquis
taking
off
her
gloves
and
showing
her
beautiful
hands
the
opportunity
is
good
with
a
poet
and
she
motioned
to
claude
on
one
side
and
poesy
the
at
these
words
conti
turned
and
gave
calyste
a
look
that
was
full
of
flattery
by
artificial
light
beatrix
seemed
more
beautiful
than
before
the
white
gleam
of
the
candles
laid
a
satiny
lustre
on
her
forehead
lighted
the
spangles
of
her
eyes
and
ran
through
her
swaying
curls
touching
them
here
and
there
into
gold
she
threw
back
the
thin
gauze
scarf
she
was
wearing
and
disclosed
her
neck
calyste
then
saw
its
beautiful
nape
white
as
milk
and
hollowed
near
the
head
until
its
lines
were
lost
toward
the
shoulders
with
soft
and
flowing
symmetry
this
neck
so
dissimilar
to
that
of
camille
was
the
sign
of
a
totally
different
character
in
beatrix
calyste
found
much
trouble
in
pretending
to
eat
nervous
motions
within
him
deprived
him
of
appetite
like
other
young
men
his
nature
was
in
the
throes
and
convulsions
which
precede
love
and
carve
it
indelibly
on
the
soul
at
his
age
the
ardor
of
the
heart
restrained
by
moral
ardor
leads
to
an
inward
conflict
which
explains
the
long
and
respectful
hesitations
the
tender
debatings
the
absence
of
all
calculation
characteristic
of
young
men
whose
hearts
and
lives
are
pure
studying
though
furtively
so
as
not
to
attract
the
notice
of
conti
the
various
details
which
made
the
marquise
so
purely
beautiful
calyste
became
before
long
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
her
majesty
he
felt
himself
dwarfed
by
the
hauteur
of
certain
of
her
glances
by
the
imposing
expression
of
a
face
that
was
wholly
aristocratic
by
a
sort
of
pride
which
women
know
how
to
express
in
slight
motions
turns
of
the
head
and
slow
gestures
effects
less
plastic
and
less
studied
than
we
think
the
false
situation
in
which
beatrix
had
placed
herself
compelled
her
to
watch
her
own
behavior
and
to
keep
herself
imposing
without
being
ridiculously
so
women
of
the
great
world
know
how
to
succeed
in
this
which
proves
a
fatal
reef
to
vulgar
women
the
expression
of
felicite
s
eyes
made
beatrix
aware
of
the
inward
adoration
she
inspired
in
the
youth
beside
her
and
also
that
it
would
be
most
unworthy
on
her
part
to
encourage
it
she
therefore
took
occasion
now
and
then
to
give
him
a
few
repressive
glances
which
fell
upon
his
heart
like
an
avalanche
of
snow
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
turned
on
felicite
a
look
in
which
she
could
read
the
tears
he
was
suppressing
by
superhuman
efforts
she
asked
him
in
a
friendly
tone
why
he
was
eating
nothing
the
question
piqued
him
and
he
began
to
force
himself
to
eat
and
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
but
whatever
he
did
madame
de
rochefide
paid
little
attention
to
him
mademoiselle
des
touches
having
started
the
topic
of
her
journey
to
italy
she
related
very
wittily
many
of
its
incidents
which
made
claude
vignon
conti
and
felicite
laugh
ah
thought
calyste
how
far
such
a
woman
is
from
me
will
she
ever
deign
to
notice
me
mademoiselle
des
touches
was
struck
with
the
expression
she
now
saw
on
calyste
s
face
and
tried
to
console
him
with
a
look
of
sympathy
claude
vignon
intercepted
that
look
from
that
moment
the
great
critic
expanded
into
gaiety
that
overflowed
in
sarcasm
he
maintained
to
beatrix
that
love
existed
only
by
desire
that
most
women
deceived
themselves
in
loving
that
they
loved
for
reasons
unknown
to
men
and
to
themselves
that
they
wanted
to
deceive
themselves
and
that
the
best
among
them
were
artful
keep
to
books
and
don
t
criticise
our
lives
said
camille
glancing
at
him
imperiously
the
dinner
ceased
to
be
gay
claude
vignon
s
sarcasm
had
made
the
two
women
pensive
calyste
was
conscious
of
pain
in
the
midst
of
the
happiness
he
found
in
looking
at
beatrix
conti
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
marquise
to
guess
her
thoughts
when
dinner
was
over
mademoiselle
des
touches
took
calyste
s
arm
gave
the
other
two
men
to
the
marquise
and
let
them
pass
before
her
that
she
might
be
alone
with
the
young
breton
for
a
moment
my
dear
calyste
she
said
you
are
acting
in
a
manner
that
embarrasses
the
marquise
she
may
be
delighted
with
your
admiration
but
she
can
not
accept
it
pray
control
she
was
hard
to
me
she
will
never
care
for
me
said
calyste
and
if
she
does
not
i
shall
die
you
my
dear
calyste
you
are
a
child
would
you
have
died
for
me
you
have
made
yourself
my
friend
he
answered
after
the
talk
that
follows
coffee
vignon
asked
conti
to
sing
something
mademoiselle
des
touches
sat
down
to
the
piano
together
she
and
gennaro
sang
the
il
mio
bene
tu
mia
the
last
duet
of
zingarelli
s
romeo
e
giulietta
one
of
the
most
pathetic
pages
of
modern
music
the
passage
tanti
expresses
love
in
all
its
grandeur
calyste
sitting
in
the
same
in
which
felicite
had
told
him
the
history
of
the
marquise
listened
in
rapt
devotion
beatrix
and
vignon
were
on
either
side
of
the
piano
conti
s
sublime
voice
knew
well
how
to
blend
with
that
of
felicite
both
had
often
sung
this
piece
they
knew
its
resources
and
they
put
their
whole
marvellous
gift
into
bringing
them
out
the
music
was
at
this
moment
what
its
creator
intended
a
poem
of
divine
melancholy
the
farewell
of
two
swans
to
life
when
it
was
over
all
present
were
under
the
influence
of
feelings
such
as
can
not
express
themselves
by
vulgar
applause
ah
music
is
the
first
of
arts
exclaimed
the
marquise
camille
thinks
youth
and
beauty
the
first
of
poesies
said
claude
vignon
mademoiselle
des
touches
looked
at
claude
with
vague
uneasiness
beatrix
not
seeing
calyste
turned
her
head
as
if
to
know
what
effect
the
music
had
produced
upon
him
less
by
way
of
interest
in
him
than
for
the
gratification
of
conti
she
saw
a
white
face
bathed
in
tears
at
the
sight
and
as
if
some
sudden
pain
had
seized
her
she
turned
back
quickly
and
looked
at
gennaro
not
only
had
music
arisen
before
the
eyes
of
calyste
touching
him
with
her
divine
wand
until
he
stood
in
presence
of
creation
from
which
she
rent
the
veil
but
he
was
dumfounded
by
conti
s
genius
in
spite
of
what
camille
had
told
him
of
the
musician
s
character
he
now
believed
in
the
beauty
of
the
soul
in
the
heart
that
expressed
such
love
how
could
he
calyste
rival
such
as
an
artist
what
woman
could
ever
cease
to
adore
such
genius
that
voice
entered
the
soul
like
another
soul
the
poor
lad
was
overwhelmed
by
poesy
and
his
own
despair
he
felt
himself
of
no
account
this
ingenuous
admission
of
his
nothingness
could
be
read
upon
his
face
mingled
with
his
admiration
he
did
not
observe
the
gesture
with
which
beatrix
attracted
to
calyste
by
the
contagion
of
a
true
feeling
called
felicite
s
attention
to
him
oh
the
adorable
heart
cried
camille
conti
you
will
never
obtain
applause
of
the
value
of
that
child
s
homage
let
us
sing
this
trio
beatrix
my
dear
when
the
marquise
camille
and
conti
had
arranged
themselves
at
the
piano
calyste
rose
softly
without
attracting
their
attention
and
flung
himself
on
one
of
the
sofas
in
the
bedroom
the
door
of
which
stood
open
where
he
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
plunged
in
meditation
x
drama
what
is
it
my
child
said
claude
vignon
who
had
slipped
silently
into
the
bedroom
after
calyste
and
now
took
him
by
the
hand
you
love
you
think
you
are
disdained
but
it
is
not
so
the
field
will
be
free
to
you
in
a
few
days
and
you
will
reign
beloved
by
more
than
loved
cried
calyste
springing
up
and
beckoning
claude
into
the
library
who
loves
me
here
camille
replied
claude
camille
loves
me
and
you
what
of
you
i
answered
claude
i
he
stopped
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
rested
his
head
with
weary
sadness
on
a
cushion
i
am
tired
of
life
but
i
have
not
the
courage
to
quit
it
he
went
on
after
a
short
silence
i
wish
i
were
mistaken
in
what
i
have
just
told
you
but
for
the
last
few
days
more
than
one
vivid
light
has
come
into
my
mind
i
did
not
wander
about
the
marshes
for
my
pleasure
no
upon
my
soul
i
did
not
the
bitterness
of
my
words
when
i
returned
and
found
you
with
camille
were
the
result
of
wounded
feeling
i
intend
to
have
an
explanation
with
her
soon
two
minds
as
as
hers
and
mine
can
not
deceive
each
other
between
two
such
professional
duellists
the
combat
can
not
last
long
therefore
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
that
i
shall
leave
les
touches
yes
perhaps
with
conti
after
we
are
gone
strange
things
will
happen
here
i
shall
regret
not
witnessing
conflicts
of
passion
of
a
kind
so
rare
in
france
and
so
dramatic
you
are
very
young
to
enter
such
dangerous
lists
you
interest
me
were
it
not
for
the
profound
disgust
i
feel
for
women
i
would
stay
and
help
you
play
this
game
it
is
difficult
you
may
lose
it
you
have
to
do
with
two
extraordinary
women
and
you
feel
too
much
for
one
to
use
the
other
judiciously
beatrix
is
dogged
by
nature
camille
has
grandeur
probably
you
will
be
wrecked
between
those
reefs
drawn
upon
them
by
the
waves
of
passion
beware
calyste
s
stupefaction
on
hearing
these
words
enabled
claude
to
say
them
without
interruption
and
leave
the
young
breton
who
remained
like
a
traveller
among
the
alps
to
whom
a
guide
has
shown
the
depth
of
some
abyss
by
flinging
a
stone
into
it
to
hear
from
the
lips
of
claude
himself
that
camille
loved
him
at
the
very
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
loved
beatrix
for
life
was
a
weight
too
heavy
for
his
untried
soul
to
bear
goaded
by
an
immense
regret
which
now
filled
all
the
past
overwhelmed
with
a
sight
of
his
position
between
beatrix
whom
he
loved
and
camille
whom
he
had
ceased
to
love
the
poor
boy
sat
despairing
and
undecided
lost
in
thought
he
sought
in
vain
for
the
reasons
which
had
made
felicite
reject
his
love
and
bring
claude
vignon
from
paris
to
oppose
it
every
now
and
then
the
voice
of
beatrix
came
fresh
and
pure
to
his
ears
from
the
little
salon
a
savage
desire
to
rush
in
and
carry
her
off
seized
him
at
such
moments
what
would
become
of
him
what
must
he
do
could
he
come
to
les
touches
if
camille
loved
him
how
could
he
come
there
to
adore
beatrix
he
saw
no
solution
to
these
difficulties
insensibly
to
him
silence
now
reigned
in
the
house
he
heard
but
without
noticing
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
then
suddenly
midnight
sounded
on
the
clock
of
the
adjoining
bedroom
and
the
voices
of
claude
and
camille
roused
him
fully
from
his
torpid
contemplation
of
the
future
before
he
could
rise
and
show
himself
he
heard
the
following
terrible
words
in
the
voice
of
claude
vignon
you
came
to
paris
last
year
desperately
in
love
with
calyste
claude
was
saying
to
felicite
but
you
were
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
passion
at
your
age
it
would
lead
you
to
a
gulf
to
hell
to
suicide
perhaps
love
can
not
exist
unless
it
thinks
itself
eternal
and
you
saw
not
far
before
you
a
horrible
parting
old
age
you
knew
would
end
the
glorious
poem
soon
you
thought
of
adolphe
that
dreadful
finale
of
the
loves
of
madame
de
stael
and
benjamin
constant
who
however
were
nearer
of
an
age
than
you
and
calyste
then
you
took
me
as
soldiers
use
fascines
to
build
entrenchments
between
the
enemy
and
themselves
you
brought
me
to
les
touches
to
mask
your
real
feelings
and
leave
you
safe
to
follow
your
own
secret
adoration
the
scheme
was
grand
and
ignoble
both
but
to
carry
it
out
you
should
have
chosen
either
a
common
man
or
one
so
preoccupied
by
noble
thoughts
that
you
could
easily
deceive
him
you
thought
me
simple
and
easy
to
mislead
as
a
man
of
genius
i
am
not
a
man
of
genius
i
am
a
man
of
talent
and
as
such
i
have
divined
you
when
i
made
that
eulogy
yesterday
on
women
of
your
age
explaining
to
you
why
calyste
had
loved
you
do
you
suppose
i
took
to
myself
your
ravished
fascinated
fazzling
glance
had
i
not
read
into
your
soul
the
eyes
were
turned
on
me
but
the
heart
was
throbbing
for
calyste
you
have
never
been
loved
my
poor
maupin
and
you
never
will
be
after
rejecting
the
beautiful
fruit
which
chance
has
offered
to
you
at
the
portals
of
that
hell
of
woman
the
lock
of
which
is
the
numeral
why
has
love
fled
me
she
said
in
a
low
voice
tell
me
you
who
know
because
you
are
not
lovable
he
answered
you
do
not
bend
to
love
love
must
bend
to
you
you
may
perhaps
have
yielded
to
some
follies
of
youth
but
there
was
no
youth
in
your
heart
your
mind
has
too
much
depth
you
have
never
been
naive
and
artless
and
you
can
not
begin
to
be
so
now
your
charm
comes
from
mystery
it
is
abstract
not
active
your
strength
repulses
men
of
strength
who
fear
a
struggle
your
power
may
please
young
souls
like
that
of
calyste
which
like
to
be
protected
though
even
them
it
wearies
in
the
long
run
you
are
grand
and
you
are
sublime
bear
with
the
consequence
of
those
two
qualities
they
what
a
sentence
cried
camille
am
i
not
a
woman
do
you
think
me
an
anomaly
possibly
said
claude
we
will
see
said
the
woman
stung
to
the
quick
farewell
my
dear
camille
i
leave
i
am
not
angry
with
you
my
dear
i
think
you
the
greatest
of
women
but
if
i
continued
to
serve
you
as
a
screen
or
a
shield
said
claude
with
two
significant
inflections
of
his
voice
you
would
despise
me
we
can
part
now
without
pain
or
remorse
we
have
neither
happiness
to
regret
nor
hopes
betrayed
to
you
as
with
some
few
but
rare
men
of
genius
love
is
not
what
nature
made
it
an
imperious
need
to
the
satisfaction
of
which
she
attaches
great
and
passing
joys
which
die
you
see
love
such
as
christianity
has
created
it
an
ideal
kingdom
full
of
noble
sentiments
of
grand
weaknesses
poesies
spiritual
sensations
devotions
of
moral
fragrance
entrancing
harmonies
placed
high
above
all
vulgar
coarseness
to
which
two
creatures
as
one
angel
fly
on
the
wings
of
pleasure
this
is
what
i
hoped
to
share
i
thought
i
held
in
you
a
key
to
that
door
closed
to
so
many
by
which
we
may
advance
toward
the
infinite
you
were
there
already
in
this
you
have
misled
me
i
return
to
my
misery
to
my
vast
prison
of
paris
such
a
deception
as
this
had
it
come
to
me
earlier
in
life
would
have
made
me
flee
from
existence
it
puts
into
my
soul
a
disenchantment
which
will
plunge
me
forever
into
an
awful
solitude
i
am
without
the
faith
which
helped
the
fathers
to
people
theirs
with
sacred
images
it
is
to
this
my
dear
camille
to
this
that
the
superiority
of
our
mind
has
brought
us
we
may
both
of
us
sing
that
dreadful
hymn
which
a
poet
has
put
into
the
mouth
of
moses
speaking
to
the
almighty
lord
god
thou
hast
made
me
powerful
and
at
this
moment
calyste
appeared
i
ought
not
to
leave
you
ignorant
that
i
am
here
he
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
showed
the
utmost
fear
a
sudden
flush
colored
her
impassible
face
with
tints
of
fire
during
this
strange
scene
she
was
more
beautiful
than
at
any
other
moment
of
her
life
we
thought
you
gone
calyste
said
claude
but
this
involuntary
discretion
on
both
sides
will
do
no
harm
perhaps
indeed
you
may
be
more
at
your
ease
at
les
touches
by
knowing
felicite
as
she
is
her
silence
shows
me
i
am
not
mistaken
as
to
the
part
she
meant
me
to
play
as
i
told
you
before
she
loves
you
but
it
is
for
yourself
not
for
herself
a
sentiment
that
few
women
are
able
to
conceive
and
practise
few
among
them
know
the
voluptuous
pleasure
of
sufferings
born
of
longing
that
is
one
of
the
magnificent
passions
reserved
for
man
but
she
is
in
some
sense
a
man
he
added
sardonically
your
love
for
beatrix
will
make
her
suffer
and
make
her
happy
tears
were
in
the
eyes
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
was
unable
to
look
either
at
the
terrible
vignon
or
the
ingenuous
calyste
she
was
frightened
at
being
understood
she
had
supposed
it
impossible
for
a
man
however
keen
his
perception
to
perceive
a
delicacy
so
a
heroism
so
lofty
as
her
own
her
evident
humiliation
at
this
unveiling
of
her
grandeur
made
calyste
share
the
emotion
of
the
woman
he
had
held
so
high
and
now
beheld
so
stricken
down
he
threw
himself
from
an
irresistible
impulse
at
her
feet
and
kissed
her
hands
laying
his
face
covered
with
tears
upon
them
claude
she
said
do
not
abandon
me
or
what
will
become
of
me
what
have
you
to
fear
replied
the
critic
calyste
has
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
with
the
marquise
you
can
not
find
a
better
barrier
between
you
than
that
this
passion
of
his
is
worth
more
to
you
than
i
yesterday
there
might
have
been
some
danger
for
you
and
for
him
you
can
take
a
maternal
interest
in
him
he
said
with
a
mocking
smile
and
be
proud
of
his
mademoiselle
des
touches
looked
at
calyste
who
had
raised
his
head
abruptly
at
these
words
claude
vignon
enjoyed
for
his
sole
vengeance
the
sight
of
their
confusion
you
yourself
have
driven
him
to
madame
de
rochefide
continued
claude
and
he
is
now
under
the
spell
you
have
dug
your
own
grave
had
you
confided
in
me
you
would
have
escaped
the
sufferings
that
await
sufferings
cried
camille
maupin
taking
calyste
s
head
in
her
hands
and
kissing
his
hair
on
which
her
tears
fell
plentifully
no
calyste
forget
what
you
have
heard
i
count
for
nothing
in
all
she
rose
and
stood
erect
before
the
two
men
subduing
both
with
the
lightning
of
her
eyes
from
which
her
soul
shone
out
while
claude
was
speaking
she
said
i
conceived
the
beauty
and
the
grandeur
of
love
without
hope
it
is
the
sentiment
that
brings
us
nearest
god
do
not
love
me
calyste
but
i
will
love
you
as
no
woman
will
it
was
the
cry
of
a
wounded
eagle
seeking
its
eyrie
claude
himself
knelt
down
took
camille
s
hand
and
kissed
it
leave
us
now
calyste
she
said
it
is
late
and
your
mother
will
be
calyste
returned
to
guerande
with
lagging
steps
turning
again
and
again
to
see
the
light
from
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
was
beatrix
he
was
surprised
himself
to
find
how
little
pity
he
felt
for
camille
but
presently
he
felt
once
more
the
agitations
of
that
scene
the
tears
she
had
left
upon
his
hair
he
suffered
with
her
suffering
he
fancied
he
heard
the
moans
of
that
noble
woman
so
beloved
so
desired
but
a
few
short
days
before
when
he
opened
the
door
of
his
paternal
home
where
total
silence
reigned
he
saw
his
mother
through
the
window
as
she
sat
sewing
by
the
light
of
the
curiously
constructed
lamp
while
she
awaited
him
tears
moistened
the
lad
s
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
what
has
happened
cried
fanny
seeing
his
emotion
which
filled
her
with
horrible
anxiety
for
all
answer
calyste
took
his
mother
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
on
her
cheeks
her
forehead
and
hair
with
one
of
those
passionate
effusions
of
feeling
that
comfort
mothers
and
fill
them
with
the
subtle
flames
of
the
life
they
have
given
it
is
you
i
love
you
cried
calyste
you
who
live
for
me
you
whom
i
long
to
render
happy
but
you
are
not
yourself
my
child
said
the
baroness
looking
at
him
attentively
what
has
happened
to
you
camille
loves
me
but
i
love
her
no
longer
he
answered
the
next
day
calyste
told
gasselin
to
watch
the
road
to
and
let
him
know
if
the
carriage
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
passed
over
it
gasselin
brought
word
that
the
carriage
had
passed
how
many
persons
were
in
it
asked
calyste
four
two
ladies
and
two
then
saddle
my
horse
and
my
father
gasselin
departed
my
nephew
what
mischief
is
in
you

said
his
aunt
zephirine
let
the
boy
amuse
himself

cried
the
baron
yesterday
he
was
dull
as
an
owl
he
is
gay
as
a
did
you
tell
him
that
our
dear
charlotte
was
to
arrive
said
zephirine
turning
to
her
no
replied
the
baroness
i
thought
perhaps
he
was
going
to
meet
her
said
mademoiselle
du
guenic
slyly
if
charlotte
is
to
stay
three
months
with
her
aunt
he
will
have
plenty
of
opportunities
to
see
her
said
his
mother
mademoiselle
de
wants
me
to
marry
charlotte
to
save
me
from
perdition
said
calyste
laughing
i
was
on
the
mall
when
she
and
the
chevalier
du
halga
were
talking
about
it
she
can
t
see
that
it
would
be
greater
perdition
for
me
to
marry
at
my
age
it
is
written
above
said
the
old
maid
interrupting
calyste
that
i
shall
not
die
tranquil
or
happy
i
wanted
to
see
our
family
continued
and
some
at
least
of
the
estates
brought
back
but
it
is
not
to
be
what
can
you
my
fine
nephew
put
in
the
scale
against
such
duties
is
it
that
actress
at
les
touches
what
said
the
baron
how
can
mademoiselle
des
touches
hinder
calyste
s
marriage
when
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
make
it
i
shall
go
and
see
i
assure
you
father
said
calyste
that
felicite
will
never
be
an
obstacle
to
my
gasselin
appeared
with
the
horses
where
are
you
going
chevalier
said
his
father
to
ha
ha
and
when
is
the
marriage
to
be
said
the
baron
believing
that
calyste
was
really
in
a
hurry
to
see
charlotte
de
kergarouet
it
is
high
time
i
was
a
grandfather
spare
the
horses
he
continued
as
he
went
on
the
portico
with
fanny
to
see
calyste
mount
remember
that
they
have
more
than
thirty
miles
to
calyste
started
with
a
tender
farewell
to
his
mother
dear
treasure
she
said
as
she
saw
him
lower
his
head
to
ride
through
the
gateway
god
keep
him
replied
the
baron
for
we
can
not
replace
the
words
made
the
baroness
shudder
my
nephew
does
not
love
charlotte
enough
to
ride
to
after
her
said
the
old
blind
woman
to
mariotte
who
was
clearing
the
no
but
a
fine
lady
a
marquise
has
come
to
les
touches
and
i
ll
warrant
he
s
after
her
that
s
the
way
at
his
age
said
mariotte
they
ll
kill
him
said
mademoiselle
du
guenic
that
won
t
kill
him
mademoiselle
quite
the
contrary
replied
mariotte
who
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
calyste
s
behavior
the
young
fellow
started
at
a
great
pace
until
gasselin
asked
him
if
he
was
trying
to
catch
the
boat
which
of
course
was
not
at
all
his
desire
he
had
no
wish
to
see
either
conti
or
claude
again
but
he
did
expect
to
be
invited
to
drive
back
with
the
ladies
leaving
gasselin
to
lead
his
horse
he
was
gay
as
a
bird
thinking
to
himself
has
just
passed
here
eyes
saw
those
trees
what
a
lovely
road
he
said
to
gasselin
ah
monsieur
brittany
is
the
most
beautiful
country
in
all
the
world
replied
the
breton
where
could
you
find
such
flowers
in
the
hedges
and
nice
cool
roads
that
wind
about
like
these
nowhere
here
comes
the
coach
from
nazaire
cried
gasselin
presently
mademoiselle
de
and
her
niece
will
be
in
it
let
us
hide
said
calyste
hide
are
you
crazy
monsieur
why
we
are
on
the
moor
the
coach
which
was
coming
up
the
sandy
hill
above
was
full
and
much
to
the
astonishment
of
calyste
there
were
no
signs
of
charlotte
we
had
to
leave
mademoiselle
de
her
sister
and
niece
they
are
dreadfully
worried
but
all
my
seats
were
engaged
by
the
said
the
conductor
to
gasselin
i
am
lost
thought
calyste
they
will
meet
me
down
when
calyste
reached
the
little
esplanade
which
surrounds
the
church
of
and
from
which
is
seen
paimboeuf
and
the
magnificent
mouths
of
the
loire
as
they
struggle
with
the
sea
he
found
camille
and
the
marquise
waving
their
handkerchiefs
as
a
last
adieu
to
two
passengers
on
the
deck
of
the
departing
steamer
beatrix
was
charming
as
she
stood
there
her
features
softened
by
the
shadow
of
a
hat
on
which
were
tufts
and
knots
of
scarlet
ribbon
she
wore
a
muslin
gown
with
a
pattern
of
flowers
and
was
leaning
with
one
hand
on
a
slender
parasol
nothing
is
finer
to
the
eyes
than
a
woman
poised
on
a
rock
like
a
statue
on
its
pedestal
conti
could
see
calyste
from
the
vessel
as
he
approached
camille
i
thought
said
the
young
man
that
you
would
probably
come
back
you
have
done
right
calyste
she
replied
pressing
his
hand
beatrix
turned
round
saw
her
young
lover
and
gave
him
the
most
imperious
look
in
her
repertory
a
smile
which
the
marquise
detected
on
the
eloquent
lips
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
made
her
aware
of
the
vulgarity
of
such
conduct
worthy
only
of
a
bourgeoise
she
then
said
to
calyste
smiling
are
you
not
guilty
of
a
slight
impertinence
in
supposing
that
i
should
bore
camille
if
left
alone
with
her
my
dear
one
man
to
two
widows
is
none
too
much
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
taking
calyste
s
arm
and
leaving
beatrix
to
watch
the
vessel
till
it
disappeared
at
this
moment
calyste
heard
the
approaching
voices
of
mademoiselle
de
the
vicomtesse
de
kergarouet
charlotte
and
gasselin
who
were
all
talking
at
once
like
so
many
magpies
the
old
maid
was
questioning
gasselin
as
to
what
had
brought
him
and
his
master
to
the
carriage
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
already
caught
her
eye
before
the
young
breton
could
get
out
of
sight
charlotte
had
seen
him
why
there
s
calyste
she
exclaimed
eagerly
go
and
offer
them
seats
in
my
carriage
said
camille
to
calyste
the
maid
can
sit
with
the
coachman
i
saw
those
ladies
lose
their
places
in
the
calyste
who
could
not
help
himself
carried
the
message
as
soon
as
madame
de
kergarouet
learned
that
the
offer
came
from
the
celebrated
camille
maupin
and
that
the
marquise
de
rochefide
was
of
the
party
she
was
much
surprised
at
the
objections
raised
by
her
elder
sister
who
refused
positively
to
profit
by
what
she
called
the
devil
s
carryall
at
nantes
which
boasted
of
more
civilization
than
guerande
camille
was
read
and
admired
she
was
thought
to
be
the
muse
of
brittany
and
an
honor
to
the
region
the
absolution
granted
to
her
in
paris
by
society
by
fashion
was
there
justified
by
her
great
fortune
and
her
early
successes
in
nantes
which
claimed
the
honor
of
having
been
if
not
her
birthplace
at
least
her
cradle
the
viscountess
therefore
eager
to
see
her
dragged
her
old
sister
forward
paying
no
attention
to
her
jeremiads
calyste
said
charlotte
oh
charlotte
replied
calyste
not
offering
his
arm
both
were
confused
she
by
his
coldness
he
by
his
cruelty
as
they
walked
up
the
sort
of
ravine
which
is
called
in
a
street
following
the
two
sisters
in
silence
in
a
moment
the
little
girl
of
sixteen
saw
her
castle
in
spain
built
and
furnished
with
romantic
hopes
a
heap
of
ruins
she
and
calyste
had
played
together
so
much
in
childhood
she
was
so
bound
up
with
him
as
it
were
that
she
had
quietly
supposed
her
future
unassailable
she
arrived
now
swept
along
by
thoughtless
happiness
like
a
circling
bird
darting
down
upon
a
and
lo
she
was
stopped
in
her
flight
unable
to
imagine
the
obstacle
what
is
the
matter
calyste
she
said
taking
his
hand
nothing
replied
the
young
man
releasing
himself
with
cruel
haste
as
he
remembered
the
projects
of
his
aunt
and
her
friend
tears
came
into
charlotte
s
eyes
she
looked
at
the
handsome
calyste
without
but
a
first
spasm
of
jealousy
seized
her
and
she
felt
the
dreadful
madness
of
rivalry
when
she
came
in
sight
of
the
two
parisian
women
and
suspected
the
cause
of
his
coldness
charlotte
de
kergarouet
was
a
girl
of
ordinary
height
and
commonplace
coloring
she
had
a
little
round
face
made
lively
by
a
pair
of
black
eyes
which
sparkled
with
cleverness
abundant
brown
hair
a
round
waist
a
flat
back
thin
arms
and
the
curt
decided
manner
of
a
provincial
girl
who
did
not
want
to
be
taken
for
a
little
goose
she
was
the
petted
child
of
the
family
on
account
of
the
preference
her
aunt
showed
for
her
at
this
moment
she
was
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
scotch
merino
in
large
plaids
lined
with
green
silk
which
she
had
worn
on
the
boat
her
of
some
common
stuff
chastely
made
with
a
chemisette
body
and
a
pleated
collar
was
fated
to
appear
even
to
her
own
eyes
horrible
in
comparison
with
the
fresh
toilets
of
beatrix
and
camille
she
was
painfully
aware
of
the
stockings
soiled
among
the
rocks
as
she
had
jumped
from
the
boat
of
shabby
leather
shoes
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
not
spoiling
better
ones
on
the
journey
a
fixed
principle
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
provincials
as
for
the
vicomtesse
de
kergarouet
she
might
stand
as
the
type
of
a
provincial
woman
tall
hard
withered
full
of
pretensions
which
did
not
show
themselves
until
they
were
mortified
talking
much
and
catching
by
dint
of
talking
as
one
cannons
at
billiards
a
few
ideas
which
gave
her
the
reputation
of
wit
endeavoring
to
humiliate
parisians
whenever
she
met
them
with
an
assumption
of
country
wisdom
and
patronage
humbling
herself
to
be
exalted
and
furious
at
being
left
upon
her
knees
fishing
as
the
english
say
for
compliments
which
she
never
caught
dressed
in
clothes
that
were
exaggerated
in
style
and
yet
ill
cared
for
mistaking
want
of
good
manners
for
dignity
and
trying
to
embarrass
others
by
paying
no
attention
to
them
refusing
what
she
desired
in
order
to
have
it
offered
again
and
to
seem
to
yield
only
to
entreaty
concerned
about
matters
that
others
have
done
with
and
surprised
at
not
being
in
the
fashion
and
finally
unable
to
get
through
an
hour
without
reference
to
nantes
matters
of
social
life
in
nantes
complaints
of
nantes
criticism
of
nantes
and
taking
as
personalities
the
remarks
she
forced
out
of
or
wearied
listeners
her
manners
language
and
ideas
had
more
or
less
descended
to
her
four
daughters
to
know
camille
maupin
and
madame
de
rochefide
would
be
for
her
a
future
and
the
topic
of
a
hundred
conversations
consequently
she
advanced
toward
the
church
as
if
she
meant
to
take
it
by
assault
waving
her
handkerchief
unfolded
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
the
heavy
corners
of
domestic
embroidery
and
trimmed
with
flimsy
lace
her
gait
was
tolerably
bold
and
cavalier
which
however
was
of
no
consequence
in
a
woman
years
of
age
monsieur
le
chevalier
she
said
to
camille
and
beatrix
pointing
to
calyste
who
was
mournfully
following
with
charlotte
has
conveyed
to
me
your
friendly
proposal
but
we
fear
my
sister
my
daughter
and
myself
to
inconvenience
sister
i
shall
not
put
these
ladies
to
inconvenience
said
mademoiselle
de
sharply
i
can
very
well
find
a
horse
in
to
take
me
camille
and
beatrix
exchanged
an
oblique
glance
which
calyste
intercepted
and
that
glance
sufficed
to
annihilate
all
the
memories
of
his
childhood
all
his
beliefs
in
the
kergarouets
and
and
to
put
an
end
forever
to
the
projects
of
the
three
families
we
can
very
well
put
five
in
the
carriage
replied
mademoiselle
des
touches
on
whom
jacqueline
turned
her
back
even
if
we
were
inconvenienced
which
can
not
be
the
case
with
your
slender
figures
besides
i
should
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
doing
a
little
service
to
calyste
s
friends
your
maid
madame
will
find
a
seat
by
the
coachman
and
your
luggage
if
you
have
any
can
go
behind
the
carriage
i
have
no
footman
with
the
viscountess
was
overwhelming
in
thanks
and
complained
that
her
sister
jacqueline
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
see
her
niece
that
she
would
not
give
her
time
to
come
properly
in
her
own
carriage
with
though
to
be
sure
the
was
not
only
longer
but
more
expensive
she
herself
was
obliged
to
return
almost
immediately
to
nantes
where
she
had
left
three
other
little
kittens
who
were
anxiously
awaiting
her
here
she
put
her
arm
round
charlotte
s
neck
charlotte
in
reply
raised
her
eyes
to
her
mother
with
the
air
of
a
little
victim
which
gave
an
impression
to
onlookers
that
the
viscountess
bored
her
four
daughters
prodigiously
by
dragging
them
on
the
scene
very
much
as
corporal
trim
produces
his
cap
in
tristram
you
are
a
fortunate
mother
and
began
camille
stopping
short
as
she
remembered
that
beatrix
must
have
parted
from
her
son
when
she
left
her
husband
s
house
oh
yes
said
the
viscountess
if
i
have
the
misfortune
of
spending
my
life
in
the
country
and
above
all
at
nantes
i
have
at
least
the
consolation
of
being
adored
by
my
children
have
you
children
she
said
to
camille
i
am
mademoiselle
des
touches
replied
camille
madame
is
the
marquise
de
then
i
must
pity
you
for
not
knowing
the
greatest
happiness
that
there
is
for
us
poor
simple
women
is
not
that
so
madame
said
the
viscountess
turning
to
beatrix
but
you
mademoiselle
have
so
many
the
tears
came
into
madame
de
rochefide
s
eyes
and
she
turned
away
toward
the
parapet
to
hide
them
calyste
followed
her
madame
said
camille
in
a
low
voice
to
the
viscountess
are
you
not
aware
that
the
marquise
is
separated
from
her
husband
she
has
not
seen
her
son
for
two
years
and
does
not
know
when
she
will
see
you
don
t
say
so
said
madame
de
kergarouet
poor
lady
is
she
legally
separated
no
by
mutual
consent
replied
camille
ah
well
i
understand
that
said
the
viscountess
boldly
old
mademoiselle
de
furious
at
being
thus
dragged
into
the
enemy
s
camp
had
retreated
to
a
short
distance
with
her
dear
charlotte
calyste
after
looking
about
him
to
make
sure
that
no
one
could
see
him
seized
the
hand
of
the
marquise
kissed
it
and
left
a
tear
upon
it
beatrix
turned
round
her
tears
dried
by
anger
she
was
about
to
utter
some
terrible
word
but
it
died
upon
her
lips
as
she
saw
the
grief
on
the
angelic
face
of
the
youth
as
deeply
touched
by
her
present
sorrow
as
she
was
herself
good
heavens
calyste
said
camille
in
his
ear
as
he
returned
with
madame
de
rochefide
are
you
to
have
for
a
and
the
little
one
for
a
wife
because
her
aunt
is
rich
replied
calyste
sarcastically
the
whole
party
now
moved
toward
the
inn
and
the
viscountess
felt
herself
obliged
to
make
camille
a
speech
on
the
savages
of
i
love
brittany
madame
replied
camille
gravely
i
was
born
at
calyste
could
not
help
admiring
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
the
tranquillity
of
her
look
and
her
quiet
manner
put
him
at
his
ease
in
spite
of
the
terrible
declarations
of
the
preceding
night
she
seemed
however
a
little
fatigued
her
eyes
were
enlarged
by
dark
circles
round
them
showing
that
he
had
not
slept
but
the
brow
dominated
the
inward
storm
with
cold
placidity
what
queens
he
said
to
charlotte
calling
her
attention
to
the
marquise
and
camille
as
he
gave
the
girl
his
arm
to
mademoiselle
de
s
great
satisfaction
what
an
idea
your
mother
has
had
said
the
old
maid
taking
her
niece
s
other
arm
to
put
herself
in
the
company
of
that
reprobate
woman
oh
aunt
a
woman
who
is
the
glory
of
brittany
the
shame
my
dear
mind
that
you
don
t
fawn
upon
her
in
that
mademoiselle
charlotte
is
right
said
calyste
you
are
not
oh
you
replied
mademoiselle
de
she
has
bewitched
i
regard
her
said
calyste
with
the
same
friendship
that
i
feel
for
since
when
have
the
du
guenics
taken
to
telling
lies
asked
the
old
maid
since
the
have
grown
deaf
replied
calyste
are
you
not
in
love
with
her
demanded
the
old
maid
i
have
been
but
i
am
so
no
longer
he
said
bad
boy
then
why
have
you
given
us
such
anxiety
i
know
very
well
that
love
is
only
foolishness
there
is
nothing
solid
but
marriage
she
remarked
looking
at
charlotte
charlotte
somewhat
reassured
hoped
to
recover
her
advantages
by
recalling
the
memories
of
childhood
she
leaned
affectionately
on
calyste
s
arm
who
resolved
in
his
own
mind
to
have
a
clear
explanation
with
the
little
heiress
ah
what
fun
we
shall
have
at
calyste
she
said
what
good
laughs
we
used
to
have
over
it
the
horses
were
now
put
in
camille
placed
madame
de
kergarouet
and
charlotte
on
the
back
seat
jacqueline
having
disappeared
she
herself
with
the
marquise
sat
forward
calyste
was
of
course
obliged
to
relinquish
the
pleasure
on
which
he
had
counted
of
driving
back
with
camille
and
beatrix
but
he
rode
beside
the
carriage
all
the
way
the
horses
being
tired
with
the
journey
went
slowly
enough
to
allow
him
to
keep
his
eyes
on
beatrix
history
must
lose
the
curious
conversations
that
went
on
between
these
four
persons
whom
accident
had
so
strangely
united
in
this
carriage
for
it
is
impossible
to
report
the
hundred
and
more
versions
which
went
the
round
of
nantes
on
the
remarks
replies
and
witticisms
which
the
viscountess
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
celebrated
camille
maupin
she
was
however
very
careful
not
to
repeat
not
even
to
comprehend
the
actual
replies
made
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
her
absurd
questions
about
camille
s
authorship
a
penance
to
which
all
authors
are
subjected
and
which
often
make
them
expiate
the
few
and
rare
pleasures
that
they
win
how
do
you
write
your
books
she
began
much
as
you
do
your
or
knitting
replied
camille
but
where
do
you
find
those
deep
reflections
those
seductive
pictures
where
you
find
the
witty
things
you
say
madame
there
is
nothing
so
easy
as
to
write
books
provided
you
will
ah
does
it
depend
wholly
on
the
will
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
it
which
of
your
compositions
do
you
prefer
i
find
it
difficult
to
prefer
any
of
my
little
i
see
you
are
on
compliments
there
is
really
nothing
new
that
one
can
i
assure
you
madame
that
i
am
very
sensible
to
the
form
which
you
give
to
the
viscountess
anxious
not
to
seem
to
neglect
the
marquise
remarked
looking
at
beatrix
with
a
meaning
air
i
shall
never
forget
this
journey
made
between
wit
and
you
flatter
me
madame
said
the
marquise
laughing
i
assure
you
that
my
wit
is
but
a
small
matter
not
to
be
mentioned
by
the
side
of
genius
besides
i
think
i
have
not
said
much
as
charlotte
who
keenly
felt
her
mother
s
absurdity
looked
at
her
endeavoring
to
stop
its
course
but
madame
de
kergarouet
went
bravely
on
in
her
tilt
with
the
satirical
parisians
calyste
who
was
trotting
slowly
beside
the
carriage
could
only
see
the
faces
of
the
two
ladies
on
the
front
seat
and
his
eyes
expressed
from
time
to
time
rather
painful
thoughts
forced
by
her
position
to
let
herself
be
looked
at
beatrix
constantly
avoided
meeting
the
young
man
s
eyes
and
practised
a
manoeuvre
most
exasperating
to
lovers
she
held
her
shawl
crossed
and
her
hands
crossed
over
it
apparently
plunged
in
the
deepest
meditation
at
a
part
of
the
road
which
is
shaded
dewy
and
verdant
as
a
forest
glade
where
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
scarcely
sounded
and
the
breeze
brought
down
balsamic
odors
and
waved
the
branches
above
their
heads
camille
called
madame
de
rochefide
s
attention
to
the
harmonies
of
the
place
and
pressed
her
knee
to
make
her
look
at
calyste
how
well
he
rides
she
said
oh
calyste
does
everything
well
said
charlotte
he
rides
like
an
englishman
said
the
marquise
indifferently
his
mother
is
irish
an
o
brien
continued
charlotte
who
thought
herself
insulted
by
such
indifference
camille
and
the
marquise
drove
through
guerande
with
the
viscountess
and
her
daughter
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
they
left
the
mother
and
daughter
at
the
end
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
guenic
mansion
where
a
crowd
came
near
gathering
attracted
by
so
unusual
a
sight
calyste
had
ridden
on
to
announce
the
arrival
of
the
company
to
his
mother
and
aunt
who
expected
them
to
dinner
that
meal
having
been
postponed
till
four
o
clock
then
he
returned
to
the
gate
to
give
his
arm
to
the
two
ladies
and
bid
camille
and
beatrix
adieu
he
kissed
the
hand
of
felicite
hoping
thereby
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
to
that
of
the
marquise
but
she
still
kept
her
arms
crossed
resolutely
and
he
cast
moist
glances
of
entreaty
at
her
uselessly
you
little
ninny
whispered
camille
lightly
touching
his
ear
with
a
kiss
that
was
full
of
friendship
quite
true
thought
calyste
to
himself
as
the
carriage
drove
away
i
am
forgetting
her
advice
but
i
shall
always
forget
it
i
m
mademoiselle
de
who
had
intrepidly
returned
to
guerande
on
the
back
of
a
hired
horse
the
vicomtesse
de
kergarouet
and
charlotte
found
dinner
ready
and
were
treated
with
the
utmost
cordiality
if
luxury
were
lacking
by
the
du
guenics
mademoiselle
zephirine
had
ordered
the
best
wine
to
be
brought
from
the
cellar
and
mariotte
had
surpassed
herself
in
her
breton
dishes
the
viscountess
proud
of
her
trip
with
the
illustrious
camille
maupin
endeavored
to
explain
to
the
assembled
company
the
present
condition
of
modern
literature
and
camille
s
place
in
it
but
the
literary
topic
met
the
fate
of
whist
neither
the
du
guenics
nor
the
abbe
nor
the
chevalier
du
halga
understood
one
word
of
it
the
rector
and
the
chevalier
had
arrived
in
time
for
the
liqueurs
at
dessert
as
soon
as
mariotte
assisted
by
gasselin
and
madame
de
kergarouet
s
maid
had
cleared
the
table
there
was
a
general
and
enthusiastic
cry
for
joy
appeared
to
reign
in
the
household
all
supposed
calyste
to
be
free
of
his
late
entanglement
and
almost
as
good
as
married
to
the
little
charlotte
the
young
man
alone
kept
silence
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
instituted
comparisons
between
his
friends
and
the
two
elegant
women
witty
accomplished
and
tasteful
who
at
the
present
moment
must
be
laughing
heartily
at
the
provincial
mother
and
daughter
judging
by
the
look
he
intercepted
between
them
he
was
seeking
in
vain
for
some
excuse
to
leave
his
family
on
this
occasion
and
go
up
as
usual
to
les
touches
when
madame
de
kergarouet
mentioned
that
she
regretted
not
having
accepted
mademoiselle
des
touches
offer
of
her
carriage
for
the
return
journey
to
which
for
the
sake
of
her
three
other
dear
kittens
she
felt
compelled
to
make
on
the
following
day
fanny
who
alone
saw
her
son
s
uneasiness
and
the
little
hold
which
charlotte
s
coquetries
and
her
mother
s
attentions
were
gaining
on
him
came
to
his
aid
madame
she
said
to
the
viscountess
you
will
i
think
be
very
uncomfortable
in
the
carrier
s
vehicle
and
especially
at
having
to
start
so
early
in
the
morning
you
would
certainly
have
done
better
to
take
the
offer
made
to
you
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
do
so
now
calyste
go
up
to
les
touches
and
arrange
the
matter
but
don
t
be
long
return
to
us
it
won
t
take
me
ten
minutes
cried
calyste
kissing
his
mother
violently
as
she
followed
him
to
the
door
xi
female
diplomacy
calyste
ran
with
the
lightness
of
a
young
fawn
to
les
touches
and
reached
the
portico
just
as
camille
and
beatrix
were
leaving
the
grand
salon
after
their
dinner
he
had
the
sense
to
offer
his
arm
to
felicite
so
you
have
abandoned
your
viscountess
and
her
daughter
for
us
she
said
pressing
his
arm
we
are
able
now
to
understand
the
full
merit
of
that
are
these
kergarouets
related
to
the
portendueres
and
to
old
admiral
de
kergarouet
whose
widow
married
charles
de
vandenesse
asked
madame
de
rochefide
the
viscountess
is
the
admiral
s
replied
camille
well
she
s
a
charming
girl
said
beatrix
placing
herself
gracefully
in
a
gothic
chair
she
will
just
do
for
you
monsieur
du
the
marriage
will
never
take
place
said
camille
hastily
mortified
by
the
cold
calm
air
with
which
the
marquise
seemed
to
consider
the
breton
girl
as
the
only
creature
fit
to
mate
him
calyste
remained
speechless
and
even
mindless
why
so
camille
asked
madame
de
rochefide
really
my
dear
said
camille
seeing
calyste
s
despair
you
are
not
generous
did
i
advise
conti
to
marry
beatrix
looked
at
her
friend
with
a
surprise
that
was
mingled
with
indefinable
suspicions
calyste
unable
to
understand
camille
s
motive
but
feeling
that
she
came
to
his
assistance
and
seeing
in
her
cheeks
that
faint
spot
of
color
which
he
knew
to
mean
the
presence
of
some
violent
emotion
went
up
to
her
rather
awkwardly
and
took
her
hand
but
she
left
him
and
seated
herself
carelessly
at
the
piano
like
a
woman
so
sure
of
her
friend
and
lover
that
she
can
afford
to
leave
him
with
another
woman
she
played
variations
improvising
them
as
she
played
on
certain
themes
chosen
unconsciously
to
herself
by
the
impulse
of
her
mind
they
were
melancholy
in
the
extreme
beatrix
seemed
to
listen
to
the
music
but
she
was
really
observing
calyste
who
much
too
young
and
artless
for
the
part
which
camille
was
intending
him
to
play
remained
in
rapt
adoration
before
his
real
idol
after
about
an
hour
during
which
time
camille
continued
to
play
beatrix
rose
and
retired
to
her
apartments
camille
at
once
took
calyste
into
her
chamber
and
closed
the
door
fearing
to
be
overheard
for
women
have
an
amazing
instinct
of
distrust
my
child
she
said
if
you
want
to
succeed
with
beatrix
you
must
seem
to
love
me
still
or
you
will
fail
you
are
a
child
you
know
nothing
of
women
all
you
know
is
how
to
love
now
loving
and
making
one
s
self
beloved
are
two
very
different
things
if
you
go
your
own
way
you
will
fall
into
horrible
suffering
and
i
wish
to
see
you
happy
if
you
rouse
not
the
pride
but
the
the
obstinacy
which
is
a
strong
feature
in
her
character
she
is
capable
of
going
off
at
any
moment
to
paris
and
rejoining
conti
and
what
will
you
do
then
i
shall
love
you
won
t
see
her
oh
yes
i
shall
he
said
how
i
shall
follow
why
you
are
as
poor
as
job
my
dear
my
father
gasselin
and
i
lived
for
three
months
in
vendee
on
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
marching
night
and
calyste
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
now
listen
to
me
i
know
that
you
have
too
much
candor
to
play
a
part
too
much
honesty
to
deceive
and
i
don
t
want
to
corrupt
such
a
nature
as
yours
yet
deception
is
the
only
way
by
which
you
can
win
beatrix
i
take
it
therefore
upon
myself
in
a
week
from
now
she
shall
love
is
it
possible
he
said
clasping
his
hands
yes
replied
camille
but
it
will
be
necessary
to
overcome
certain
pledges
which
she
has
made
to
herself
i
will
do
that
for
you
you
must
not
interfere
in
the
rather
arduous
task
i
shall
undertake
the
marquise
has
a
true
aristocratic
delicacy
of
perception
she
is
keenly
distrustful
no
hunter
could
meet
with
game
more
wary
or
more
difficult
to
capture
you
are
wholly
unable
to
cope
with
her
will
you
promise
me
a
blind
obedience
what
must
i
do
replied
the
youth
very
little
said
camille
come
here
every
day
and
devote
yourself
to
me
come
to
my
rooms
avoid
beatrix
if
you
meet
her
we
will
stay
together
till
four
o
clock
you
shall
employ
the
time
in
study
and
i
in
smoking
it
will
be
hard
for
you
not
to
see
her
but
i
will
find
you
a
number
of
interesting
books
you
have
read
nothing
as
yet
of
george
sand
i
will
send
one
of
my
people
this
very
evening
to
nantes
to
buy
her
works
and
those
of
other
authors
whom
you
ought
to
know
the
evenings
we
will
spend
together
and
i
permit
you
to
make
love
to
me
if
you
can
it
will
be
for
the
i
know
camille
that
your
affection
for
me
is
great
and
so
rare
that
it
makes
me
wish
i
had
never
met
beatrix
he
replied
with
simple
good
faith
but
i
don
t
see
what
you
hope
from
all
i
hope
to
make
her
love
good
heavens
it
can
not
be
possible
he
cried
again
clasping
his
hands
toward
camille
who
was
greatly
moved
on
seeing
the
joy
that
she
gave
him
at
her
own
expense
now
listen
to
me
carefully
she
said
if
you
break
the
agreement
between
us
if
you
have
not
a
long
conversation
but
a
mere
exchange
of
words
with
the
marquise
in
private
if
you
let
her
question
you
if
you
fail
in
the
silent
part
i
ask
you
to
play
which
is
certainly
not
a
very
difficult
one
i
do
assure
you
she
said
in
a
serious
tone
you
will
lose
her
i
don
t
understand
the
meaning
of
what
you
are
saying
to
me
cried
calyste
looking
at
camille
with
adorable
naivete
if
you
did
understand
it
you
wouldn
t
be
the
noble
and
beautiful
calyste
that
you
are
she
replied
taking
his
hand
and
kissing
it
calyste
then
did
what
he
had
never
before
done
he
took
camille
round
the
waist
and
kissed
her
gently
not
with
love
but
with
tenderness
as
he
kissed
his
mother
mademoiselle
des
touches
did
not
restrain
her
tears
go
now
she
said
my
child
and
tell
your
viscountess
that
my
carriage
is
at
her
calyste
wanted
to
stay
longer
but
he
was
forced
to
obey
her
imperious
and
imperative
gesture
he
went
home
gaily
he
believed
that
in
a
week
the
beautiful
beatrix
would
love
him
the
players
at
found
him
once
more
the
calyste
they
had
missed
for
the
last
two
months
charlotte
attributed
this
change
to
herself
mademoiselle
de
was
charming
to
him
the
abbe
grimont
endeavored
to
make
out
what
was
passing
in
the
mother
s
mind
the
chevalier
du
halga
rubbed
his
hands
the
two
old
maids
were
as
lively
as
lizards
the
viscountess
lost
one
hundred
sous
by
accumulated
which
so
excited
the
cupidity
of
zephirine
that
she
regretted
not
being
able
to
see
the
cards
and
even
spoke
sharply
to
her
who
acted
as
the
proxy
of
her
eyes
the
party
lasted
till
eleven
o
clock
there
were
two
defections
the
baron
and
the
chevalier
who
went
to
sleep
in
their
respective
chairs
mariotte
had
made
galettes
of
buckwheat
the
baroness
produced
a
the
illustrious
house
of
du
guenic
served
a
little
supper
before
the
departure
of
its
guests
consisting
of
fresh
butter
fruits
and
cream
in
addition
to
mariotte
s
cakes
for
which
festal
event
issued
from
their
wrappings
a
silver
teapot
and
some
beautiful
old
english
china
sent
to
the
baroness
by
her
aunts
this
appearance
of
modern
splendor
in
the
ancient
hall
together
with
the
exquisite
grace
of
its
mistress
brought
up
like
a
true
irish
lady
to
make
and
pour
out
tea
that
mighty
affair
to
englishwomen
had
something
charming
about
them
the
most
exquisite
luxury
could
never
have
attained
to
the
simple
modest
noble
effect
produced
by
this
sentiment
of
joyful
hospitality
a
few
moments
after
calyste
s
departure
from
les
touches
beatrix
who
had
heard
him
go
returned
to
camille
whom
she
found
with
humid
eyes
lying
back
on
her
sofa
what
is
it
felicite
asked
the
marquise
i
am
forty
years
old
and
i
love
him
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
with
dreadful
tones
of
agony
in
her
voice
her
eyes
becoming
hard
and
brilliant
if
you
knew
beatrix
the
tears
i
have
shed
over
the
lost
years
of
my
youth
to
be
loved
out
of
pity
to
know
that
one
owes
one
s
happiness
only
to
perpetual
care
to
the
slyness
of
cats
to
traps
laid
for
innocence
and
all
the
youthful
virtues
oh
it
is
infamous
if
it
were
not
that
one
finds
absolution
in
the
magnitude
of
love
in
the
power
of
happiness
in
the
certainty
of
being
forever
above
all
other
women
in
his
memory
the
first
to
carve
on
that
young
heart
the
ineffaceable
happiness
of
an
absolute
devotion
i
would
yes
if
he
asked
it
i
would
fling
myself
into
the
sea
sometimes
i
find
myself
wishing
that
he
would
ask
it
it
would
then
be
an
oblation
not
a
suicide
ah
beatrix
by
coming
here
you
have
unconsciously
set
me
a
hard
task
i
know
it
will
be
difficult
to
keep
him
against
you
but
you
love
conti
you
are
noble
and
generous
you
will
not
deceive
me
on
the
contrary
you
will
help
me
to
retain
my
calyste
s
love
i
expected
the
impression
you
would
make
upon
him
but
i
have
not
committed
the
mistake
of
seeming
jealous
that
would
only
have
added
fuel
to
the
flame
on
the
contrary
before
you
came
i
described
you
in
such
glowing
colors
that
you
hardly
realize
the
portrait
although
you
are
it
seems
to
me
more
beautiful
than
this
vehement
elegy
in
which
truth
was
mingled
with
deception
completely
duped
the
marquise
claude
vignon
had
told
conti
the
reasons
for
his
departure
and
beatrix
was
of
course
informed
of
them
she
determined
therefore
to
behave
with
generosity
and
give
the
cold
shoulder
to
calyste
but
at
the
same
instant
there
came
into
her
soul
that
quiver
of
joy
which
vibrates
in
the
heart
of
every
woman
when
she
finds
herself
beloved
the
love
a
woman
inspires
in
any
man
s
heart
is
flattery
without
hypocrisy
and
it
is
impossible
for
some
women
to
forego
it
but
when
that
man
belongs
to
a
friend
his
homage
gives
more
than
pleasure
it
gives
delight
beatrix
sat
down
beside
her
friend
and
began
to
coax
her
prettily
you
have
not
a
white
hair
she
said
you
haven
t
even
a
wrinkle
your
temples
are
just
as
fresh
as
ever
whereas
i
know
more
than
one
woman
of
thirty
who
is
obliged
to
cover
hers
look
dear
she
added
lifting
her
curls
see
what
that
journey
to
italy
has
cost
her
temples
showed
an
almost
imperceptible
withering
of
the
texture
of
the
delicate
skin
she
raised
her
sleeves
and
showed
camille
the
same
slight
withering
of
the
wrists
where
the
transparent
tissue
suffered
the
blue
network
of
swollen
veins
to
be
visible
and
three
deep
lines
made
a
bracelet
of
wrinkles
there
my
dear
are
two
spots
which
as
a
certain
writer
ferreting
for
the
miseries
of
women
has
said
never
lie
she
continued
one
must
needs
have
suffered
to
know
the
truth
of
his
observation
happily
for
us
most
men
know
nothing
about
it
they
don
t
read
us
like
that
dreadful
your
letter
told
me
all
replied
camille
happiness
ignores
everything
but
itself
you
boasted
too
much
of
yours
to
be
really
happy
truth
is
deaf
dumb
and
blind
where
love
really
is
consequently
seeing
very
plainly
that
you
have
your
reasons
for
abandoning
conti
i
have
feared
to
have
you
here
my
dear
calyste
is
an
angel
he
is
as
good
as
he
is
beautiful
his
innocent
heart
will
not
resist
your
eyes
already
he
admires
you
too
much
not
to
love
you
at
the
first
encouragement
your
coldness
can
alone
preserve
him
to
me
i
confess
to
you
with
the
cowardice
of
true
passion
that
if
he
were
taken
from
me
i
should
die
that
dreadful
book
of
benjamin
constant
adolphe
tells
us
only
of
adolphe
s
sorrows
but
what
about
those
of
the
woman
hey
the
man
did
not
observe
them
enough
to
describe
them
and
what
woman
would
have
dared
to
reveal
them
they
would
dishonor
her
sex
humiliate
its
virtues
and
pass
into
vice
ah
i
measure
the
abyss
before
me
by
my
fears
by
these
sufferings
that
are
those
of
hell
but
beatrix
i
will
tell
you
this
in
case
i
am
abandoned
my
choice
is
what
is
it
cried
beatrix
with
an
eagerness
that
made
camille
shudder
the
two
friends
looked
at
each
other
with
the
keen
attention
of
venetian
inquisitors
their
souls
clashed
in
that
rapid
glance
and
struck
fire
like
flints
the
marquise
lowered
her
eyes
after
man
there
is
nought
but
god
said
the
celebrated
woman
god
is
the
unknown
i
shall
fling
myself
into
that
as
into
some
vast
abyss
calyste
has
sworn
to
me
that
he
admires
you
only
as
he
would
a
picture
but
alas
you
are
but
in
the
full
magnificence
of
your
beauty
the
struggle
thus
begins
between
him
and
me
by
falsehood
but
i
have
one
support
happily
i
know
a
means
to
keep
him
true
to
me
and
i
shall
what
means
that
is
my
secret
dear
let
me
have
the
benefits
of
my
age
if
claude
vignon
as
conti
has
doubtless
told
you
flings
me
back
into
the
gulf
i
who
had
climbed
to
a
rock
which
i
thought
inaccessible
i
will
at
least
gather
the
pale
and
fragile
but
delightful
flowers
that
grow
in
its
madame
de
rochefide
was
moulded
like
wax
in
those
able
hands
camille
felt
an
almost
savage
pleasure
in
thus
entrapping
her
rival
in
her
toils
she
sent
her
to
bed
that
night
piqued
by
curiosity
floating
between
jealousy
and
generosity
but
most
assuredly
with
her
mind
full
of
the
beautiful
calyste
she
will
be
enchanted
to
deceive
me
thought
camille
as
she
kissed
her
then
when
she
was
alone
the
author
the
constructor
of
dramas
gave
place
to
the
woman
and
she
burst
into
tears
filling
her
hookah
with
tobacco
soaked
in
opium
she
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
smoking
dulling
thus
the
sufferings
of
her
soul
and
seeing
through
the
clouds
about
her
the
beautiful
young
head
of
her
late
lover
what
a
glorious
book
to
write
if
i
were
only
to
express
my
pain
she
said
to
herself
but
it
is
written
already
sappho
lived
before
me
and
sappho
was
young
a
fine
and
touching
heroine
truly
a
woman
of
forty
ah
my
poor
camille
smoke
your
hookah
you
haven
t
even
the
resource
of
making
a
poem
of
your
misery
that
s
the
last
drop
of
anguish
in
your
cup
the
next
morning
calyste
came
before
and
slipped
upstairs
as
he
was
told
into
camille
s
own
room
where
he
found
the
books
felicite
sat
before
the
window
smoking
contemplating
in
turn
the
marshes
the
sea
and
calyste
to
whom
she
now
and
then
said
a
few
words
about
beatrix
at
one
time
seeing
the
marquise
strolling
about
the
garden
she
raised
a
curtain
in
a
way
to
attract
her
attention
and
also
to
throw
a
band
of
light
across
calyste
s
book
my
child
i
shall
ask
you
to
stay
to
dinner
but
you
must
refuse
with
a
glance
at
the
marquise
which
will
show
her
how
much
you
regret
not
when
the
three
actors
met
in
the
salon
and
this
comedy
was
played
calyste
felt
for
a
moment
his
equivocal
position
and
the
glance
that
he
cast
on
beatrix
was
far
more
expressive
than
felicite
expected
beatrix
had
dressed
herself
charmingly
what
a
bewitching
toilet
my
dearest
said
camille
when
calyste
had
departed
these
manoeuvres
lasted
six
days
during
which
time
many
conversations
into
which
camille
maupin
put
all
her
ability
took
place
unknown
to
calyste
between
herself
and
the
marquise
they
were
like
the
preliminaries
of
a
duel
between
two
women
a
duel
without
truce
in
which
the
assault
was
made
on
both
sides
with
snares
feints
false
generosities
deceitful
confessions
crafty
confidences
by
which
one
hid
and
the
other
bared
her
love
and
in
which
the
sharp
steel
of
camille
s
treacherous
words
entered
the
heart
of
her
friend
and
left
its
poison
there
beatrix
at
last
took
offence
at
what
she
thought
camille
s
distrust
she
considered
it
out
of
place
between
them
at
the
same
time
she
was
enchanted
to
find
the
great
writer
a
victim
to
the
pettiness
of
her
sex
and
she
resolved
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
showing
her
where
her
greatness
ended
and
how
even
she
could
be
humiliated
my
dear
what
is
to
be
the
excuse
for
monsieur
du
guenic
s
not
dining
with
us
she
asked
looking
maliciously
at
her
friend
monday
you
said
we
had
engagements
tuesday
the
dinner
was
poor
wednesday
you
were
afraid
his
mother
would
be
angry
thursday
you
wanted
to
take
a
walk
with
me
and
yesterday
you
simply
dismissed
him
without
a
reason
i
shall
have
my
way
and
i
mean
that
he
shall
already
my
dear
said
camille
with
cutting
irony
the
marquise
blushed
stay
monsieur
du
guenic
said
camille
in
the
tone
of
a
queen
beatrix
became
cold
and
hard
contradictory
in
tone
epigrammatic
and
almost
rude
to
calyste
whom
felicite
sent
home
to
play
with
charlotte
de
kergarouet
is
not
dangerous
at
any
rate
said
beatrix
sarcastically
young
lovers
are
like
hungry
men
kitchen
odors
will
not
appease
their
hunger
they
think
too
much
of
what
is
coming
to
care
for
the
means
that
bring
it
as
calyste
walked
back
to
guerande
his
soul
was
full
of
beatrix
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
profound
feminine
cleverness
which
felicite
was
displaying
on
his
behalf
during
this
week
the
marquise
had
only
written
once
to
conti
a
symptom
of
indifference
which
had
not
escaped
the
watchful
eyes
of
camille
who
imparted
it
to
calyste
all
calyste
s
life
was
concentrated
in
the
short
moment
of
the
day
during
which
he
was
allowed
to
see
the
marquise
this
drop
of
water
far
from
allaying
his
thirst
only
redoubled
it
the
magic
promise
beatrix
shall
love
you
made
by
camille
was
the
talisman
with
which
he
strove
to
restrain
the
fiery
ardor
of
his
passion
but
he
knew
not
how
to
consume
the
time
he
could
not
sleep
and
spent
the
hours
of
the
night
in
reading
every
evening
he
brought
back
with
him
as
mariotte
remarked
cartloads
of
books
his
aunt
called
down
maledictions
on
the
head
of
mademoiselle
des
touches
but
his
mother
who
had
gone
on
several
occasions
to
his
room
on
seeing
his
light
burning
far
into
the
night
knew
by
this
time
the
secret
of
his
conduct
though
for
her
love
was
a
sealed
book
and
she
was
even
unaware
of
her
own
ignorance
fanny
rose
through
maternal
tenderness
into
certain
ideas
of
it
but
the
depths
of
such
sentiment
being
dark
and
obscured
by
clouds
to
her
mind
she
was
shocked
at
the
state
in
which
she
saw
him
the
solitary
uncomprehended
desire
of
his
soul
which
was
evidently
consuming
him
simply
terrified
her
calyste
had
but
one
thought
beatrix
was
always
before
him
in
the
evenings
while
cards
were
being
played
his
abstraction
resembled
his
father
s
somnolence
finding
him
so
different
from
what
he
was
when
he
loved
camille
the
baroness
became
aware
with
a
sort
of
horror
of
the
symptoms
of
real
love
a
species
of
possession
which
had
seized
upon
her
son
a
love
unknown
within
the
walls
of
that
old
mansion
feverish
irritability
a
constant
absorption
in
thought
made
calyste
almost
doltish
often
he
would
sit
for
hours
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
some
figure
in
the
tapestry
one
morning
his
mother
implored
him
to
give
up
les
touches
and
leave
the
two
women
forever
not
go
to
les
touches
he
cried
oh
yes
yes
go
do
not
look
so
my
darling
she
cried
kissing
him
on
the
eyes
that
had
flashed
such
flames
under
these
circumstances
calyste
often
came
near
losing
the
fruit
of
camille
s
plot
through
the
breton
fury
of
his
love
of
which
he
was
ceasing
to
be
the
master
finally
he
swore
to
himself
in
spite
of
his
promise
to
felicite
to
see
beatrix
and
speak
to
her
he
wanted
to
read
her
eyes
to
bathe
in
their
light
to
examine
every
detail
of
her
dress
breathe
its
perfume
listen
to
the
music
of
her
voice
watch
the
graceful
composition
of
her
movements
embrace
at
a
glance
the
whole
figure
and
study
her
as
a
general
studies
the
field
where
he
means
to
win
a
decisive
battle
he
willed
as
lovers
will
he
was
grasped
by
desires
which
closed
his
ears
and
darkened
his
intellect
and
threw
him
into
an
unnatural
state
in
which
he
was
conscious
of
neither
obstacles
nor
distances
nor
the
existence
even
of
his
own
body
one
morning
he
resolved
to
go
to
les
touches
at
an
earlier
hour
than
that
agreed
upon
and
endeavor
to
meet
beatrix
in
the
garden
he
knew
she
walked
there
daily
before
breakfast
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
the
marquise
had
gone
as
it
happened
to
see
the
marshes
and
the
little
bay
with
its
margin
of
fine
sand
where
the
sea
penetrates
and
lies
like
a
lake
in
the
midst
of
the
dunes
they
had
just
returned
and
were
walking
up
a
garden
path
beside
the
lawn
conversing
as
they
walked
if
the
scenery
pleases
you
said
camille
we
must
take
calyste
and
make
a
trip
to
croisic
there
are
splendid
rocks
there
cascades
of
granite
little
bays
with
natural
basins
charmingly
unexpected
and
capricious
things
besides
the
sea
itself
with
its
store
of
marble
fragments
a
world
of
amusement
also
you
will
see
women
making
fuel
with
which
they
nail
against
the
walls
of
their
houses
to
dry
in
the
sun
after
which
they
pile
it
up
as
we
do
peat
in
what
will
you
really
risk
calyste
cried
the
marquise
laughing
in
a
tone
which
proved
that
camille
s
ruse
had
answered
its
purpose
ah
my
dear
she
replied
if
you
did
but
know
the
angelic
soul
of
that
dear
child
you
would
understand
me
in
him
mere
beauty
is
nothing
one
must
enter
that
pure
heart
which
is
amazed
at
every
step
it
takes
into
the
kingdom
of
love
what
faith
what
grace
what
innocence
the
ancients
were
right
enough
in
the
worship
they
paid
to
sacred
beauty
some
traveller
i
forget
who
relates
that
when
wild
horses
lose
their
leader
they
choose
the
handsomest
horse
in
the
herd
for
his
successor
beauty
my
dear
is
the
genius
of
things
it
is
the
ensign
which
nature
hoists
over
her
most
precious
creations
it
is
the
truest
of
symbols
as
it
is
the
greatest
of
accidents
did
any
one
ever
suppose
that
angels
could
be
deformed
are
they
not
necessarily
a
combination
of
grace
and
strength
what
is
it
that
makes
us
stand
for
hours
before
some
picture
in
italy
where
genius
has
striven
through
years
of
toil
to
realize
but
one
of
those
accidents
of
nature
come
call
up
your
sense
of
the
truth
of
things
and
answer
me
is
it
not
the
idea
of
beauty
which
our
souls
associate
with
moral
grandeur
well
calyste
is
one
of
those
dreams
those
visions
realized
he
has
the
regal
power
of
a
lion
tranquilly
unsuspicious
of
its
royalty
when
he
feels
at
his
ease
he
is
witty
and
i
love
his
girlish
timidity
my
soul
rests
in
his
heart
away
from
all
corruptions
all
ideas
of
knowledge
literature
the
world
society
politics
those
useless
accessories
under
which
we
stifle
happiness
i
am
what
i
have
never
been
a
child
i
am
sure
of
him
but
i
like
to
play
at
jealousy
he
likes
it
too
besides
that
is
part
of
my
beatrix
walked
on
pensively
in
silence
camille
endured
unspeakable
martyrdom
and
she
cast
a
sidelong
look
at
her
companion
which
looked
like
flame
ah
my
dear
but
are
happy
said
beatrix
presently
laying
her
hand
on
camille
s
arm
like
a
woman
wearied
out
with
some
inward
struggle
yes
happy
indeed
replied
felicite
with
savage
bitterness
the
two
women
dropped
upon
a
bench
from
a
sense
of
exhaustion
no
creature
of
her
sex
was
ever
played
upon
like
an
instrument
with
more
machiavellian
penetration
than
the
marquise
throughout
this
week
yes
you
are
happy
but
i
she
said
to
know
of
conti
s
infidelities
and
have
to
bear
them
why
not
leave
him
said
camille
seeing
the
hour
had
come
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
can
i
oh
poor
boy
both
were
gazing
into
a
clump
of
trees
with
a
stupefied
air
camille
rose
i
will
go
and
hasten
breakfast
my
walk
has
given
me
an
appetite
she
said
our
conversation
has
taken
away
mine
remarked
beatrix
the
marquise
in
her
morning
dress
was
outlined
in
white
against
the
dark
greens
of
the
foliage
calyste
who
had
slipped
through
the
salon
into
the
garden
took
a
path
along
which
he
sauntered
as
though
he
were
meeting
her
by
accident
beatrix
could
not
restrain
a
quiver
as
he
approached
her
madame
in
what
way
did
i
displease
you
yesterday
he
said
after
the
first
commonplace
sentences
had
been
exchanged
but
you
have
neither
pleased
me
nor
displeased
me
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
the
tone
air
and
manner
in
which
the
marquise
said
these
words
encouraged
calyste
am
i
so
indifferent
to
you
he
said
in
a
troubled
voice
as
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
ought
we
not
to
be
indifferent
to
each
other
replied
the
marquise
have
we
not
each
of
us
another
and
a
binding
attachment
oh
cried
calyste
if
you
mean
camille
i
did
love
her
but
i
love
her
no
then
why
are
you
shut
up
together
every
morning
she
said
with
a
treacherous
smile
i
don
t
suppose
that
camille
in
spite
of
her
passion
for
tobacco
prefers
her
cigar
to
you
or
that
you
in
your
admiration
for
female
authors
spend
four
hours
a
day
in
reading
their
so
then
you
know
began
the
guileless
young
breton
his
face
glowing
with
the
happiness
of
being
face
to
face
with
his
idol
calyste
cried
camille
angrily
suddenly
appearing
and
interrupting
him
she
took
his
arm
and
drew
him
away
to
some
distance
calyste
is
this
what
you
promised
me
beatrix
heard
these
words
of
reproach
as
mademoiselle
des
touches
disappeared
toward
the
house
taking
calyste
with
her
she
was
stupefied
by
the
young
man
s
assertion
and
could
not
comprehend
it
she
was
not
as
strong
as
claude
vignon
in
truth
the
part
being
played
by
camille
maupin
as
shocking
as
it
was
grand
is
one
of
those
wicked
grandeurs
which
women
only
practise
when
driven
to
extremity
by
it
their
hearts
are
broken
in
it
the
feelings
of
their
sex
are
lost
to
them
it
begins
an
abnegation
which
ends
by
either
plunging
them
to
hell
or
lifting
them
to
heaven
during
breakfast
which
calyste
was
invited
to
share
the
marquise
whose
sentiments
could
be
noble
and
generous
made
a
sudden
return
upon
herself
resolving
to
stifle
the
germs
of
love
which
were
rising
in
her
heart
she
was
neither
cold
nor
hard
to
calyste
but
gently
indifferent
a
course
which
tortured
him
felicite
brought
forward
a
proposition
that
they
should
make
on
the
next
day
but
one
an
excursion
into
the
curious
and
interesting
country
lying
between
les
touches
croisic
and
the
village
of
batz
she
begged
calyste
to
employ
himself
on
the
morrow
in
hiring
a
boat
and
sailors
to
take
them
across
the
little
bay
undertaking
herself
to
provide
horses
and
provisions
and
all
else
that
was
necessary
for
a
party
of
pleasure
in
which
there
was
to
be
no
fatigue
beatrix
stopped
the
matter
short
however
by
saying
that
she
did
not
wish
to
make
excursions
round
the
country
calyste
s
face
which
had
beamed
with
delight
at
the
prospect
was
suddenly
overclouded
what
are
you
afraid
of
my
dear
asked
camille
my
position
is
so
delicate
i
do
not
wish
to
compromise
i
will
not
say
my
reputation
but
my
happiness
she
said
meaningly
with
a
glance
at
the
young
breton
you
know
very
well
how
suspicious
conti
can
be
if
he
knew
who
will
tell
him
he
is
coming
back
here
to
fetch
me
said
beatrix
calyste
turned
pale
in
spite
of
all
that
camille
could
urge
in
spite
of
calyste
s
entreaties
madame
de
rochefide
remained
inflexible
and
showed
what
camille
had
called
her
obstinacy
calyste
left
les
touches
the
victim
of
one
of
those
depressions
of
love
which
threaten
in
certain
men
to
turn
into
madness
he
began
to
revolve
in
his
mind
some
decided
means
of
coming
to
an
explanation
with
beatrix
xii
correspondence
when
calyste
reached
home
he
did
not
leave
his
room
until
dinner
time
and
after
dinner
he
went
back
to
it
at
ten
o
clock
his
mother
uneasy
at
his
absence
went
to
look
for
him
and
found
him
writing
in
the
midst
of
a
pile
of
blotted
and
paper
he
was
writing
to
beatrix
for
distrust
of
camille
had
come
into
his
mind
the
air
and
manner
of
the
marquise
during
their
brief
interview
in
the
garden
had
singularly
encouraged
him
no
first
ever
was
or
ever
will
be
as
may
readily
be
supposed
a
brilliant
effort
of
the
mind
in
all
young
men
not
tainted
by
corruption
such
a
letter
is
written
with
gushings
from
the
heart
too
overflowing
too
multifarious
not
to
be
the
essence
the
elixir
of
many
other
letters
begun
rejected
and
rewritten
here
is
the
one
that
calyste
finally
composed
and
which
he
read
aloud
to
his
poor
astonished
mother
to
her
the
old
mansion
seemed
to
have
taken
fire
this
love
of
her
son
flamed
up
in
it
like
the
glare
of
a
conflagration
calyste
to
madame
la
marquise
de
rochefide
madame
i
loved
you
when
you
were
to
me
but
a
dream
judge
therefore
of
the
force
my
love
acquired
when
i
saw
you
the
dream
was
far
surpassed
by
the
reality
it
is
my
grief
and
my
misfortune
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
that
you
do
not
know
already
of
your
beauty
and
your
charms
and
yet
perhaps
they
have
awakened
in
no
other
heart
so
deep
a
sentiment
as
they
have
in
me
in
so
many
ways
you
are
beautiful
i
have
studied
you
so
much
while
thinking
of
you
day
and
night
that
i
have
penetrated
the
mysteries
of
your
being
the
secrets
of
your
heart
and
your
delicacy
so
little
appreciated
have
you
ever
been
loved
understood
adored
as
you
deserve
to
be
let
me
tell
you
now
that
there
is
not
a
trait
in
your
nature
which
my
heart
does
not
interpret
your
pride
is
understood
by
mine
the
grandeur
of
your
glance
the
grace
of
your
bearing
the
distinction
of
your
movements
all
things
about
your
person
are
in
harmony
with
the
thoughts
the
hopes
the
desires
hidden
in
the
depths
of
your
soul
it
is
because
i
have
divined
them
all
that
i
think
myself
worthy
of
your
notice
if
i
had
not
become
within
the
last
few
days
another
yourself
i
could
not
speak
to
you
of
myself
this
letter
indeed
relates
far
more
to
you
than
it
does
to
me
beatrix
in
order
to
write
to
you
i
have
silenced
my
youth
i
have
laid
aside
myself
i
have
aged
my
thoughts
or
rather
it
is
you
who
have
aged
them
by
this
week
of
dreadful
sufferings
caused
innocently
indeed
by
you
do
not
think
me
one
of
those
common
lovers
at
whom
i
have
heard
you
laugh
so
justly
what
merit
is
there
in
loving
a
young
and
beautiful
and
wise
and
noble
woman
alas
i
have
no
merit
what
can
i
be
to
you
a
child
attracted
by
effulgence
of
beauty
and
by
moral
grandeur
as
the
insects
are
attracted
to
the
light
you
can
not
do
otherwise
than
tread
upon
the
flowers
of
my
soul
they
are
there
at
your
feet
and
all
my
happiness
consists
in
your
stepping
on
them
absolute
devotion
unbounded
faith
love
unquenchable
all
these
treasures
of
a
true
and
tender
heart
are
nothing
nothing
they
serve
only
to
love
with
they
can
not
win
the
love
we
crave
sometimes
i
do
not
understand
why
a
worship
so
ardent
does
not
warm
its
idol
and
when
i
meet
your
eye
so
cold
so
stern
i
turn
to
ice
within
me
your
disdain
is
the
acting
force
between
us
not
my
worship
why
you
can
not
hate
me
as
much
as
i
love
you
why
then
does
the
weaker
feeling
rule
the
stronger
i
loved
felicite
with
all
the
powers
of
my
heart
yet
i
forgot
her
in
a
day
in
a
moment
when
i
saw
you
she
was
my
error
you
are
my
truth
you
have
unknowingly
destroyed
my
happiness
and
yet
you
owe
me
nothing
in
return
i
loved
camille
without
hope
and
i
have
no
hope
from
you
nothing
is
changed
but
my
divinity
i
was
a
pagan
i
am
now
a
christian
that
is
all
except
this
you
have
taught
me
that
to
love
is
the
greatest
of
all
joys
the
joy
of
being
loved
comes
later
according
to
camille
it
is
not
loving
to
love
for
a
short
time
only
the
love
that
does
not
grow
from
day
to
day
from
hour
to
hour
is
a
mere
wretched
passion
in
order
to
grow
love
must
not
see
its
end
and
she
saw
the
end
of
ours
the
setting
of
our
sun
of
love
when
i
beheld
you
i
understood
her
words
which
until
then
i
had
disputed
with
all
my
youth
with
all
the
ardor
of
my
desires
with
the
despotic
sternness
of
twenty
years
that
grand
and
noble
camille
mingled
her
tears
with
mine
and
yet
she
firmly
rejected
the
love
she
saw
must
end
therefore
i
am
free
to
love
you
here
on
earth
and
in
the
heaven
above
us
as
we
love
god
if
you
loved
me
you
would
have
no
such
arguments
as
camille
used
to
overthrow
my
love
we
are
both
young
we
could
fly
on
equal
wing
across
our
sunny
heaven
not
fearing
storms
as
that
grand
eagle
feared
them
but
ha
what
am
i
saying
my
thoughts
have
carried
me
beyond
the
humility
of
my
real
hopes
believe
me
believe
in
the
submission
the
patience
the
mute
adoration
which
i
only
ask
you
not
to
wound
uselessly
i
know
beatrix
that
you
can
not
love
me
without
the
loss
of
your
therefore
i
ask
for
no
return
camille
once
said
there
was
some
hidden
fatality
in
names
of
hers
that
fatality
i
felt
for
myself
on
the
jetty
of
guerande
when
i
read
on
the
shores
of
the
ocean
your
name
yes
you
will
pass
through
my
life
as
beatrice
passed
through
that
of
dante
my
heart
will
be
a
pedestal
for
that
white
statue
cold
distant
jealous
and
oppressive
it
is
forbidden
to
you
to
love
me
i
know
that
you
will
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
you
will
be
betrayed
humiliated
unhappy
but
you
have
in
you
a
devil
s
pride
which
binds
you
to
that
column
you
have
once
embraced
you
are
like
samson
you
will
perish
by
holding
to
it
but
this
i
have
not
divined
my
love
is
too
blind
for
that
camille
has
told
it
to
me
it
is
not
my
mind
that
speaks
to
you
of
this
it
is
hers
i
have
no
mind
with
which
to
reason
when
i
think
of
you
blood
gushes
from
my
heart
and
its
hot
wave
darkens
my
intellect
weakens
my
strength
paralyzes
my
tongue
and
bends
my
knees
i
can
only
adore
you
whatever
you
may
do
to
me
camille
calls
your
resolution
obstinacy
i
defend
you
and
i
call
it
virtue
you
are
only
the
more
beautiful
because
of
it
i
know
my
destiny
and
the
pride
of
a
breton
can
rise
to
the
height
of
the
woman
who
makes
her
pride
a
virtue
therefore
dear
beatrix
be
kind
be
consoling
to
me
when
victims
were
selected
they
crowned
them
with
flowers
so
do
you
to
me
you
owe
me
the
flowers
of
pity
the
music
of
my
sacrifice
am
i
not
a
proof
of
your
grandeur
will
you
not
rise
to
the
level
of
my
disdained
love
disdained
in
spite
of
its
sincerity
in
spite
of
its
immortal
passion
ask
camille
how
i
behaved
to
her
after
the
day
she
told
me
on
her
return
to
les
touches
that
she
loved
claude
vignon
i
was
mute
i
suffered
in
silence
well
for
you
i
will
show
even
greater
strength
i
will
bury
my
feelings
in
my
heart
if
you
will
not
drive
me
to
despair
if
you
will
only
understand
my
heroism
a
single
word
of
praise
from
you
is
enough
to
make
me
bear
the
pains
of
martyrdom
but
if
you
persist
in
this
cold
silence
this
deadly
disdain
you
will
make
me
think
you
fear
me
ah
beatrix
be
with
me
what
you
are
charming
witty
gay
and
tender
talk
to
me
of
conti
as
camille
has
talked
to
me
of
claude
i
have
no
other
spirit
in
my
soul
no
other
genius
but
that
of
love
nothing
is
there
that
can
make
you
fear
me
i
will
be
in
your
presence
as
if
i
loved
you
not
can
you
reject
so
humble
a
prayer
the
prayer
of
a
child
who
only
asks
that
his
light
shall
lighten
him
that
his
sun
may
warm
him
he
whom
you
love
can
be
with
you
at
all
times
but
i
poor
calyste
have
so
few
days
in
which
to
see
you
you
will
soon
be
freed
from
me
therefore
i
may
return
to
les
touches
may
i
not
you
will
not
refuse
my
arm
for
that
excursion
we
shall
go
together
to
croisic
and
to
batz
if
you
do
not
go
i
shall
take
it
for
an
answer
calyste
will
understand
it
there
were
four
more
pages
of
the
same
sort
in
close
fine
writing
wherein
calyste
explained
the
sort
of
threat
conveyed
in
the
last
words
and
related
his
youth
and
life
but
the
tale
was
chiefly
told
in
exclamatory
phrases
with
many
of
those
points
and
dashes
of
which
modern
literature
is
so
prodigal
when
it
comes
to
crucial
passages
as
though
they
were
planks
offered
to
the
reader
s
imagination
to
help
him
across
crevasses
the
rest
of
this
artless
letter
was
merely
repetition
but
if
it
was
not
likely
to
touch
madame
de
rochefide
and
would
very
slightly
interest
the
admirers
of
strong
emotions
it
made
the
mother
weep
as
she
said
to
her
son
in
her
tender
voice
my
child
you
are
not
this
tumultuous
poem
of
sentiments
which
had
arisen
like
a
storm
in
calyste
s
heart
terrified
the
baroness
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
read
a
calyste
was
standing
in
deep
perplexity
how
could
he
send
that
letter
he
followed
his
mother
back
into
the
salon
with
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
burning
in
his
heart
like
fire
the
chevalier
du
halga
was
still
there
and
the
last
deal
of
a
lively
was
going
on
charlotte
de
kergarouet
in
despair
at
calyste
s
indifference
was
paying
attention
to
his
father
as
a
means
of
promoting
her
marriage
calyste
wandered
hither
and
thither
like
a
butterfly
which
had
flown
into
the
room
by
mistake
at
last
when
was
over
he
drew
the
chevalier
du
halga
into
the
great
salon
from
which
he
sent
away
mademoiselle
de
s
page
and
mariotte
what
does
he
want
of
the
chevalier
said
old
zephirine
addressing
her
friend
jacqueline
calyste
strikes
me
as
replied
mademoiselle
de
he
pays
charlotte
no
more
attention
than
if
she
were
a
remembering
that
the
chevalier
du
halga
had
the
reputation
of
having
navigated
in
his
youth
the
waters
of
gallantry
it
came
into
calyste
s
head
to
consult
him
what
is
the
best
way
to
send
a
letter
secretly
to
one
s
mistress
he
said
to
the
old
gentleman
in
a
whisper
well
you
can
slip
it
into
the
hand
of
her
maid
with
a
louis
or
two
underneath
it
for
sooner
or
later
the
maid
will
find
out
the
secret
and
it
is
just
as
well
to
let
her
into
it
at
once
replied
the
chevalier
on
whose
face
was
the
gleam
of
a
smile
but
on
the
whole
it
is
best
to
give
the
letter
a
louis
or
two
exclaimed
calyste
he
snatched
up
his
hat
and
ran
to
les
touches
where
he
appeared
like
an
apparition
in
the
little
salon
guided
thither
by
the
voices
of
camille
and
beatrix
they
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
together
apparently
on
the
best
of
terms
calyste
with
the
headlong
impulse
of
love
flung
himself
heedlessly
on
the
sofa
beside
the
marquise
took
her
hand
and
slipped
the
letter
within
it
he
did
this
so
rapidly
that
felicite
watchful
as
she
was
did
not
perceive
it
calyste
s
heart
was
tingling
with
an
emotion
half
sweet
half
painful
as
he
felt
the
hand
of
beatrix
press
his
own
and
saw
her
without
interrupting
her
words
or
seeming
in
the
least
disconcerted
slip
the
letter
into
her
glove
you
fling
yourself
on
a
woman
s
dress
without
mercy
she
said
laughing
calyste
is
a
boy
who
is
wanting
in
said
felicite
not
sparing
him
an
open
rebuke
calyste
rose
took
camille
s
hand
and
kissed
it
then
he
went
to
the
piano
and
ran
his
over
the
notes
making
them
all
sound
at
once
like
a
rapid
scale
this
exuberance
of
joy
surprised
camille
and
made
her
thoughtful
she
signed
to
calyste
to
come
to
her
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
whispered
in
his
ear
nothing
he
replied
there
is
something
between
them
thought
mademoiselle
des
touches
the
marquise
was
impenetrable
camille
tried
to
make
calyste
talk
hoping
that
his
artless
mind
would
betray
itself
but
the
youth
excused
himself
on
the
ground
that
his
mother
expected
him
and
he
left
les
touches
at
eleven
o
clock
not
however
without
having
faced
the
fire
of
a
piercing
glance
from
camille
to
whom
that
excuse
was
made
for
the
first
time
after
the
agitations
of
a
wakeful
night
filled
with
visions
of
beatrix
and
after
going
a
score
of
times
through
the
chief
street
of
guerande
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
answer
to
his
letter
which
did
not
come
calyste
finally
received
the
following
reply
which
the
marquise
s
entering
the
hotel
du
guenic
presented
to
him
he
carried
it
to
the
garden
and
there
in
the
grotto
he
read
as
follows
madame
de
rochefide
to
calyste
you
are
a
noble
child
but
you
are
only
a
child
you
are
bound
to
camille
who
adores
you
you
would
not
find
in
me
either
the
perfections
that
distinguish
her
or
the
happiness
that
she
can
give
you
whatever
you
may
think
she
is
young
and
i
am
old
her
heart
is
full
of
treasures
mine
is
empty
she
has
for
you
a
devotion
you
ill
appreciate
she
is
unselfish
she
lives
only
for
you
and
in
you
i
on
the
other
hand
am
full
of
doubts
i
should
drag
you
down
to
a
wearisome
life
without
grandeur
of
any
kind
a
life
ruined
by
my
own
conduct
camille
is
free
she
can
go
and
come
as
she
will
i
am
a
slave
you
forget
that
i
love
and
am
beloved
the
situation
in
which
i
have
placed
myself
forbids
my
accepting
homage
that
a
man
should
love
me
or
say
he
loves
me
is
an
insult
to
turn
to
another
would
be
to
place
myself
at
the
level
of
the
lowest
of
my
sex
you
who
are
young
and
full
of
delicacy
how
can
you
oblige
me
to
say
these
things
which
rend
my
heart
as
they
issue
from
it
i
preferred
the
scandal
of
an
irreparable
deed
to
the
shame
of
constant
deception
my
own
loss
of
station
to
a
loss
of
honesty
in
the
eyes
of
many
persons
whose
esteem
i
value
i
am
still
worthy
but
if
i
permitted
another
man
to
love
me
i
should
fall
indeed
the
world
is
indulgent
to
those
whose
constancy
covers
as
with
a
mantle
the
irregularity
of
their
happiness
but
it
is
pitiless
to
vice
you
see
i
feel
neither
disdain
nor
anger
i
am
answering
your
letter
frankly
and
with
simplicity
you
are
young
you
are
ignorant
of
the
world
you
are
carried
away
by
fancy
you
are
incapable
like
all
whose
lives
are
pure
of
making
the
reflections
which
evil
suggests
but
i
will
go
still
further
were
i
destined
to
be
the
most
humiliated
of
women
were
i
forced
to
hide
fearful
sorrows
were
i
betrayed
abandoned
which
thank
god
is
wholly
impossible
no
one
in
this
world
would
see
me
more
yes
i
believe
i
should
find
courage
to
kill
a
man
who
seeing
me
in
that
situation
should
talk
to
me
of
love
you
now
know
my
mind
to
its
depths
perhaps
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
having
written
to
me
after
receiving
your
letter
and
above
all
after
making
you
this
reply
i
could
be
at
my
ease
with
you
in
camille
s
house
i
could
act
out
my
natural
self
and
be
what
you
ask
of
me
but
i
hardly
need
speak
to
you
of
the
bitter
ridicule
that
would
overwhelm
me
if
my
eyes
or
my
manner
ceased
to
express
the
sentiments
of
which
you
complain
a
second
robbery
from
camille
would
be
a
proof
of
her
want
of
power
which
no
woman
could
twice
forgive
even
if
i
loved
you
if
i
were
blind
to
all
else
if
i
forgot
all
else
i
should
still
see
camille
her
love
for
you
is
a
barrier
too
high
to
be
o
erleaped
by
any
power
even
by
the
wings
of
an
angel
none
but
a
devil
would
fail
to
recoil
before
such
treachery
in
this
my
dear
calyste
are
many
motives
which
delicate
and
noble
women
keep
to
themselves
of
which
you
men
know
nothing
nor
could
you
understand
them
even
though
you
were
all
as
like
our
sex
as
you
yourself
appear
to
be
at
this
moment
my
child
you
have
a
mother
who
has
shown
you
what
you
ought
to
be
in
life
she
is
pure
and
spotless
she
fulfils
her
destiny
nobly
what
i
have
heard
of
her
has
filled
my
eyes
with
tears
and
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
i
envy
her
i
too
might
have
been
what
she
is
calyste
that
is
the
woman
your
wife
should
be
and
such
should
be
her
life
i
will
never
send
you
back
in
jest
as
i
have
done
to
that
little
charlotte
who
would
weary
you
to
death
but
i
do
commend
you
to
some
divine
young
girl
who
is
worthy
of
your
love
if
i
were
yours
your
life
would
be
blighted
you
would
have
given
me
your
whole
existence
and
i
you
see
i
am
frank
i
should
have
taken
it
i
should
have
gone
with
you
heaven
knows
where
far
from
the
world
but
i
should
have
made
you
most
unhappy
for
i
am
jealous
i
see
lions
lurking
in
the
path
and
monsters
in
drops
of
water
i
am
made
wretched
by
trifles
that
most
women
put
up
with
inexorable
thoughts
from
my
heart
not
yours
would
poison
our
existence
and
destroy
my
life
if
a
man
after
ten
years
happiness
were
not
as
respectful
and
as
delicate
as
he
was
to
me
at
first
i
should
resent
the
change
it
would
abase
me
in
my
own
eyes
such
a
lover
could
not
believe
in
the
amadis
and
the
cyrus
of
my
dreams
true
love
is
but
a
dream
not
a
reality
i
see
in
yours
only
the
joy
of
a
desire
the
end
of
which
is
as
yet
unperceived
by
you
for
myself
i
am
not
forty
years
old
i
have
not
bent
my
pride
beneath
the
yoke
of
experience
in
short
i
am
a
woman
too
young
to
be
anything
but
odious
i
will
not
answer
for
my
temper
my
grace
and
charm
are
all
external
perhaps
i
have
not
yet
suffered
enough
to
have
the
indulgent
manners
and
the
absolute
tenderness
which
come
to
us
from
cruel
disappointments
happiness
has
its
insolence
and
i
i
fear
am
insolent
camille
will
be
always
your
devoted
slave
i
should
be
an
unreasonable
tyrant
besides
camille
was
brought
to
you
by
your
guardian
angel
at
the
turning
point
of
your
life
to
show
you
the
career
you
ought
to
follow
a
career
in
which
you
can
not
fail
i
know
felicite
her
tenderness
is
inexhaustible
she
may
ignore
the
graces
of
our
sex
but
she
possesses
that
fruitful
strength
that
genius
for
constancy
that
noble
intrepidity
which
makes
us
willing
to
accept
the
rest
she
will
marry
you
to
some
young
girl
no
matter
what
she
suffers
she
will
find
you
a
free
beatrix
if
it
is
a
beatrix
indeed
who
answers
to
your
desires
in
a
wife
and
to
your
dreams
she
will
smooth
all
the
difficulties
in
your
way
the
sale
of
a
single
acre
of
her
ground
in
paris
would
free
your
property
in
brittany
she
will
make
you
her
heir
are
you
not
already
her
son
by
adoption
alas
what
could
i
do
for
your
happiness
nothing
do
not
betray
that
infinite
love
which
contents
itself
with
the
duties
of
motherhood
ah
i
think
her
very
fortunate
my
camille
she
can
well
afford
to
forgive
your
feeling
for
poor
beatrix
women
of
her
age
are
indulgent
to
such
fancies
when
they
are
sure
of
being
loved
they
will
pardon
a
passing
infidelity
in
fact
it
is
often
one
of
their
keenest
pleasures
to
triumph
over
a
younger
rival
camille
is
above
such
women
and
that
remark
does
not
refer
to
her
but
i
make
it
to
ease
your
mind
i
have
studied
camille
closely
she
is
to
my
eyes
one
of
the
greatest
women
of
our
age
she
has
mind
and
she
has
goodness
two
qualities
almost
irreconcilable
in
woman
she
is
generous
and
simple
two
other
grandeurs
seldom
found
together
in
our
sex
i
have
seen
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
such
treasures
that
the
beautiful
line
of
dante
on
eternal
happiness
which
i
heard
her
interpreting
to
you
the
other
day
senza
brama
sicura
ricchezza
seems
as
if
made
for
her
she
has
talked
to
me
of
her
career
she
has
related
her
life
showing
me
how
love
that
object
of
our
prayers
our
dreams
has
ever
eluded
her
i
replied
that
she
seemed
to
me
an
instance
of
the
difficulty
if
not
the
impossibility
of
uniting
in
one
person
two
great
glories
you
calyste
are
one
of
the
angelic
souls
whose
mate
it
seems
impossible
to
find
but
camille
will
obtain
for
you
even
if
she
dies
in
doing
so
the
hand
of
some
young
girl
with
whom
you
can
make
a
happy
home
for
myself
i
hold
out
to
you
a
friendly
hand
and
i
count
not
on
your
heart
but
on
your
mind
to
make
you
in
future
a
brother
to
me
as
i
shall
be
a
sister
to
you
and
i
desire
that
this
letter
may
terminate
a
correspondence
which
between
les
touches
and
guerande
is
rather
absurd
beatrix
de
casteran
the
baroness
stirred
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
by
the
strange
exhibitions
and
the
rapid
changes
of
her
boy
s
emotions
could
no
longer
sit
quietly
at
her
work
in
the
ancient
hall
after
looking
at
calyste
from
time
to
time
she
finally
rose
and
came
to
him
in
a
manner
that
was
humble
and
yet
bold
she
wanted
him
to
grant
a
favor
which
she
felt
she
had
a
right
to
demand
well
she
said
trembling
and
looking
at
the
letter
but
not
directly
asking
for
it
calyste
read
it
aloud
to
her
and
these
two
noble
souls
so
simple
so
guileless
saw
nothing
in
that
wily
and
treacherous
epistle
of
the
malice
or
the
snares
which
the
marquise
had
written
into
it
she
is
a
noble
woman
a
grand
woman
said
the
baroness
with
moistened
eyes
i
will
pray
to
god
for
her
i
did
not
know
that
a
woman
could
abandon
her
husband
and
child
and
yet
preserve
a
soul
so
virtuous
she
is
indeed
worthy
of
have
i
not
every
reason
to
adore
her
cried
calyste
but
where
will
this
love
lead
you
said
the
baroness
ah
my
child
how
dangerous
are
women
with
noble
sentiments
there
is
less
to
fear
in
those
who
are
bad
marry
charlotte
de
kergarouet
and
release
of
the
estate
by
selling
a
few
farms
mademoiselle
de
can
bestow
that
grand
result
upon
you
in
the
marriage
contract
and
she
will
also
help
you
with
her
experience
to
make
the
most
of
your
property
you
will
be
able
to
leave
your
children
a
great
name
and
a
fine
forget
beatrix
said
calyste
in
a
muffled
voice
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
he
left
the
baroness
and
went
up
to
his
own
room
to
write
an
answer
to
the
marquise
madame
du
guenic
whose
heart
retained
every
word
of
madame
de
rochefide
s
letter
felt
the
need
of
some
help
in
comprehending
it
more
clearly
and
also
the
grounds
of
calyste
s
hope
at
this
hour
the
chevalier
du
halga
was
always
to
be
seen
taking
his
dog
for
a
walk
on
the
mall
the
baroness
certain
of
finding
him
there
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
out
the
sight
of
the
baronne
du
guenic
walking
in
guerande
elsewhere
than
to
church
or
on
the
two
pretty
roads
selected
as
promenades
on
days
accompanied
by
the
baron
and
mademoiselle
de
was
an
event
so
remarkable
that
two
hours
later
throughout
the
whole
town
people
accosted
each
other
with
the
remark
madame
du
guenic
went
out
did
you
meet
her
as
soon
as
this
amazing
news
reached
the
ears
of
mademoiselle
de
she
said
to
her
niece
something
very
extraordinary
is
happening
at
the
du
calyste
is
madly
in
love
with
that
beautiful
marquise
de
rochefide
said
charlotte
i
ought
to
leave
guerande
and
return
to
the
chevalier
du
halga
much
surprised
at
being
sought
by
the
baroness
released
the
chain
of
his
little
dog
aware
that
he
could
not
divide
himself
between
the
two
interests
chevalier
began
the
baroness
you
used
to
practise
gallantry
here
the
chevalier
du
halga
straightened
himself
up
with
an
air
that
was
not
a
little
vain
madame
du
guenic
without
naming
her
son
or
the
marquise
repeated
as
nearly
as
possible
the
and
asked
the
chevalier
to
explain
to
her
the
meaning
of
such
an
answer
du
halga
snuffed
the
air
and
stroked
his
chin
he
listened
attentively
he
made
grimaces
and
finally
he
looked
fixedly
at
the
baroness
with
a
knowing
air
as
he
said
when
thoroughbred
horses
want
to
leap
a
barrier
they
go
up
to
reconnoitre
it
and
smell
it
over
calyste
is
a
lucky
dog
oh
hush
she
cried
i
m
mute
ah
in
the
olden
time
i
knew
all
about
it
said
the
old
chevalier
striking
an
attitude
the
weather
was
fine
the
breeze
nor
east
how
the
kept
close
to
the
wind
that
day
when
oh
he
cried
interrupting
himself
we
shall
have
a
change
of
weather
my
ears
are
buzzing
and
i
feel
the
pain
in
my
ribs
you
know
don
t
you
that
the
battle
of
the
was
so
famous
that
women
wore
madame
de
kergarouet
was
the
first
to
come
to
the
opera
in
that
and
i
said
to
her
madame
you
are
dressed
for
the
speech
was
repeated
from
box
to
box
all
through
the
the
baroness
listened
pleasantly
to
the
old
hero
who
faithful
to
the
laws
of
gallantry
escorted
her
to
the
alley
of
her
house
neglecting
thisbe
the
secret
of
thisbe
s
existence
had
once
escaped
him
thisbe
was
the
granddaughter
of
a
delightful
thisbe
the
pet
of
madame
l
amirale
de
kergarouet
first
wife
of
the
comte
de
kergarouet
the
chevalier
s
commanding
officer
the
present
thisbe
was
eighteen
years
old
the
baroness
ran
up
to
calyste
s
room
he
was
absent
she
saw
a
letter
not
sealed
but
addressed
to
madame
de
rochefide
lying
on
the
table
an
invincible
curiosity
compelled
the
anxious
mother
to
read
it
this
act
of
indiscretion
was
cruelly
punished
the
letter
revealed
to
her
the
depths
of
the
gulf
into
which
his
passion
was
hurling
calyste
calyste
to
madame
la
marquise
de
rochefide
what
care
i
for
the
race
of
the
du
guenics
in
these
days
beatrix
what
is
their
name
to
me
my
name
is
beatrix
the
happiness
of
beatrix
is
my
happiness
her
life
is
my
life
and
all
my
fortune
is
in
her
heart
our
estates
have
been
mortgaged
these
two
hundred
years
and
so
they
may
remain
for
two
hundred
more
our
farmers
have
charge
of
them
no
one
can
take
them
from
us
to
see
you
to
love
you
that
is
my
property
my
object
my
religion
you
talk
to
me
of
marrying
the
very
thought
convulses
my
heart
is
there
another
beatrix
i
will
marry
no
one
but
you
i
will
wait
for
you
twenty
years
if
need
be
i
am
young
and
you
will
be
ever
beautiful
my
mother
is
a
saint
i
do
not
blame
her
but
she
has
never
loved
i
know
now
what
she
has
lost
and
what
sacrifices
she
has
made
you
have
taught
me
beatrix
to
love
her
better
she
is
in
my
heart
with
you
and
no
other
can
ever
be
there
she
is
your
only
rival
is
not
this
to
say
that
you
reign
in
that
heart
supreme
therefore
your
arguments
have
no
force
upon
my
mind
as
for
camille
you
need
only
say
the
word
or
give
me
a
mere
sign
and
i
will
ask
her
to
tell
you
herself
that
i
do
not
love
her
she
is
the
mother
of
my
intellect
nothing
more
nothing
less
from
the
moment
that
i
first
saw
you
she
became
to
me
a
sister
a
friend
a
comrade
what
you
will
of
that
kind
but
we
have
no
rights
other
than
those
of
friendship
upon
each
other
i
took
her
for
a
woman
until
i
saw
you
you
have
proved
to
me
that
camille
is
a
man
she
swims
hunts
smokes
drinks
rides
on
horseback
writes
and
analyzes
hearts
and
books
she
has
no
weaknesses
she
marches
on
in
all
her
strength
her
motions
even
have
no
resemblance
to
your
graceful
movements
to
your
step
airy
as
the
flight
of
a
bird
neither
has
she
your
voice
of
love
your
tender
eyes
your
gracious
manner
she
is
camille
maupin
there
is
nothing
of
the
woman
about
her
whereas
in
you
are
all
the
things
of
womanhood
that
i
love
it
has
seemed
to
me
from
the
first
moment
when
i
saw
you
that
you
were
mine
you
will
laugh
at
that
fancy
but
it
has
grown
and
is
growing
it
seems
to
me
unnatural
anomalous
that
we
should
be
apart
you
are
my
soul
my
life
i
can
not
live
where
you
are
not
let
me
love
you
let
us
fly
let
us
go
into
some
country
where
you
know
no
one
where
only
god
and
i
can
reach
your
heart
my
mother
who
loves
you
might
some
day
follow
us
ireland
is
full
of
castles
my
mother
s
family
will
lend
us
one
ah
beatrix
let
us
go
a
boat
a
few
sailors
and
we
are
there
before
any
one
can
know
we
have
fled
this
world
you
fear
so
much
you
have
never
been
loved
i
feel
it
as
i
your
letter
in
which
i
fancy
i
can
see
that
if
the
reasons
you
bring
forward
did
not
exist
you
would
let
yourself
be
loved
by
me
beatrix
a
sacred
love
wipes
out
the
past
yes
i
love
you
so
truly
that
i
could
wish
you
doubly
shamed
if
so
my
love
might
prove
itself
by
holding
you
a
saint
you
call
my
love
an
insult
oh
beatrix
you
do
not
think
it
so
the
love
of
noble
youth
and
you
have
called
me
that
would
honor
a
queen
therefore
let
us
walk
as
lovers
hand
in
hand
among
the
rocks
and
beside
the
sea
your
step
upon
the
sands
of
my
old
brittany
will
bless
them
anew
to
me
give
me
this
day
of
happiness
and
that
passing
alms
unremembered
alas
by
you
will
be
eternal
riches
to
your
calyste
the
baroness
let
fall
the
letter
without
reading
all
of
it
she
knelt
upon
a
chair
and
made
a
mental
prayer
to
god
to
save
her
calyste
s
reason
to
put
his
madness
his
error
far
away
from
him
to
lead
him
from
the
path
in
which
she
now
beheld
him
what
are
you
doing
mother
said
calyste
entering
the
room
i
am
praying
to
god
for
you
she
answered
simply
turning
her
tearful
eyes
upon
him
i
have
committed
the
sin
of
reading
that
letter
my
calyste
is
mad
a
sweet
madness
said
the
young
man
kissing
her
i
wish
i
could
see
that
woman
she
sighed
mamma
said
calyste
we
shall
take
a
boat
and
cross
to
croisic
if
you
are
on
the
jetty
you
can
see
so
saying
he
sealed
his
letter
and
departed
for
les
touches
that
which
above
all
terrified
the
baroness
was
to
see
a
sentiment
attaining
by
the
force
of
its
own
instinct
to
the
of
practised
experience
calyste
s
letter
to
beatrix
was
such
as
the
chevalier
du
halga
with
his
knowledge
of
the
world
might
have
dictated
xiii
duel
between
women
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
enjoyments
that
small
minds
or
inferior
minds
can
obtain
is
that
of
deceiving
a
great
soul
and
laying
snares
for
it
beatrix
knew
herself
far
beneath
camille
maupin
this
inferiority
lay
not
only
in
the
collection
of
mental
and
moral
qualities
which
we
call
but
in
the
things
of
the
heart
called
at
the
moment
when
calyste
was
hurrying
to
les
touches
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
first
love
borne
on
the
wings
of
hope
the
marquise
was
feeling
a
keen
delight
in
knowing
herself
the
object
of
the
first
love
of
so
charming
a
young
man
she
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
wish
herself
a
sharer
in
the
sentiment
but
she
thought
it
heroism
on
her
part
to
repress
the
as
the
italians
say
she
thought
she
was
equalling
camille
s
devotion
and
told
herself
moreover
that
she
was
sacrificing
herself
to
her
friend
the
vanities
peculiar
to
frenchwomen
which
constitute
the
celebrated
coquetry
of
which
she
was
so
signal
an
instance
were
flattered
and
deeply
satisfied
by
calyste
s
love
assailed
by
such
powerful
seduction
she
was
resisting
it
and
her
virtues
sang
in
her
soul
a
concert
of
praise
and
the
two
women
were
half
lying
in
apparent
indolence
on
the
divan
of
the
little
salon
so
filled
with
harmony
and
the
fragrance
of
flowers
the
windows
were
open
for
the
north
wind
had
ceased
to
blow
a
soothing
southerly
breeze
was
ruffling
the
surface
of
the
salt
lake
before
them
and
the
sun
was
glittering
on
the
sands
of
the
shore
their
souls
were
as
deeply
agitated
as
the
nature
before
them
was
tranquil
and
the
heat
within
was
not
less
ardent
bruised
by
the
working
of
the
machinery
which
she
herself
had
set
in
motion
camille
was
compelled
to
keep
watch
for
her
safety
fearing
the
amazing
cleverness
of
the
friendly
enemy
or
rather
the
inimical
friend
she
had
allowed
within
her
borders
to
guard
her
own
secrets
and
maintain
herself
aloof
she
had
taken
of
late
to
contemplations
of
nature
she
cheated
the
aching
of
her
own
heart
by
seeking
a
meaning
in
the
world
around
her
finding
god
in
that
desert
of
heaven
and
earth
when
an
unbeliever
once
perceives
the
presence
of
god
he
flings
himself
unreservedly
into
catholicism
which
viewed
as
a
system
is
complete
that
morning
camille
s
brow
had
worn
the
halo
of
thoughts
born
of
these
researches
during
a
of
painful
struggle
calyste
was
ever
before
her
like
a
celestial
image
the
beautiful
youth
to
whom
she
had
secretly
devoted
herself
had
become
to
her
a
guardian
angel
was
it
not
he
who
led
her
into
those
loftier
regions
where
suffering
ceased
beneath
the
weight
of
incommensurable
infinity
and
now
a
certain
air
of
triumph
about
beatrix
disturbed
her
no
woman
gains
an
advantage
over
another
without
allowing
it
to
be
felt
however
much
she
may
deny
having
taken
it
nothing
was
ever
more
strange
in
its
course
than
the
dumb
moral
struggle
which
was
going
on
between
these
two
women
each
hiding
from
the
other
a
secret
each
believing
herself
generous
through
hidden
sacrifices
calyste
arrived
holding
the
letter
between
his
hand
and
his
glove
ready
to
slip
it
at
some
convenient
moment
into
the
hand
of
beatrix
camille
whom
the
subtle
change
in
the
manner
of
her
friend
had
not
escaped
seemed
not
to
watch
her
but
did
watch
her
in
a
mirror
at
the
moment
when
calyste
was
just
entering
the
room
that
is
always
a
crucial
moment
for
women
the
cleverest
as
well
as
the
silliest
of
them
the
frankest
as
the
shrewdest
are
seldom
able
to
keep
their
secret
it
bursts
from
them
at
any
rate
to
the
eyes
of
another
woman
too
much
reserve
or
too
little
a
free
and
luminous
look
the
mysterious
lowering
of
eyelids
all
betray
at
that
sudden
moment
the
sentiment
which
is
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
hide
for
real
indifference
has
something
so
radically
cold
about
it
that
it
can
never
be
simulated
women
have
a
genius
for
shades
shades
of
detail
shades
of
character
they
know
them
all
there
are
times
when
their
eyes
take
in
a
rival
from
head
to
foot
they
can
guess
the
slightest
movement
of
a
foot
beneath
a
gown
the
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
the
waist
they
know
the
significance
of
things
which
to
a
man
seem
insignificant
two
women
observing
each
other
play
one
of
the
choicest
scenes
of
comedy
that
the
world
can
show
calyste
has
committed
some
folly
thought
camille
perceiving
in
each
of
her
guests
an
indefinable
air
of
persons
who
have
a
mutual
understanding
there
was
no
longer
either
stiffness
or
pretended
indifference
on
the
part
of
beatrix
she
now
regarded
calyste
as
her
own
property
calyste
was
even
more
transparent
he
colored
as
guilty
people
or
happy
people
color
he
announced
that
he
had
come
to
make
arrangements
for
the
excursion
on
the
following
day
then
you
really
intend
to
go
my
dear
said
camille
interrogatively
yes
said
beatrix
how
did
you
know
it
calyste
asked
mademoiselle
des
touches
i
came
here
to
find
out
replied
calyste
on
a
look
flashed
at
him
by
madame
de
rochefide
who
did
not
wish
camille
to
gain
the
slightest
inkling
of
their
correspondence
they
have
an
agreement
together
thought
camille
who
caught
the
look
in
the
powerful
sweep
of
her
eye
under
the
pressure
of
that
thought
a
horrible
discomposure
overspread
her
face
and
frightened
beatrix
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
she
cried
nothing
well
then
calyste
send
my
horses
and
yours
across
to
croisic
so
that
we
may
drive
home
by
way
of
batz
we
will
breakfast
at
croisic
and
get
home
in
time
for
dinner
you
must
take
charge
of
the
boat
arrangements
let
us
start
by
eight
you
will
see
some
fine
sights
beatrix
and
one
very
strange
one
you
will
see
cambremer
a
man
who
does
penance
on
a
rock
for
having
wilfully
killed
his
son
oh
you
are
in
a
primitive
land
among
a
primitive
race
of
people
where
men
are
moved
by
other
sentiments
than
those
of
ordinary
mortals
calyste
shall
tell
you
the
tale
it
is
a
drama
of
the
she
went
into
her
bedroom
for
she
was
stifling
calyste
gave
his
letter
to
beatrix
and
followed
camille
calyste
you
are
loved
i
think
but
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
you
have
done
some
foolish
loved
he
exclaimed
dropping
into
a
chair
camille
looked
into
the
next
room
beatrix
had
disappeared
the
fact
was
odd
women
do
not
usually
leave
a
room
which
contains
the
man
they
admire
unless
they
have
either
the
certainty
of
seeing
him
again
or
something
better
still
mademoiselle
des
touches
said
to
herself
can
he
have
given
her
a
letter
but
she
thought
the
innocent
breton
incapable
of
such
boldness
if
you
have
disobeyed
me
all
will
be
lost
through
your
own
fault
she
said
to
him
very
gravely
go
now
and
make
your
preparations
for
she
made
a
gesture
which
calyste
did
not
venture
to
resist
as
he
walked
toward
croisic
to
engage
the
boatmen
fears
came
into
calyste
s
mind
camille
s
speech
foreshadowed
something
fatal
and
he
believed
in
the
second
sight
of
her
maternal
affection
when
he
returned
four
hours
later
very
tired
and
expecting
to
dine
at
les
touches
he
found
camille
s
maid
keeping
watch
over
the
door
to
tell
him
that
neither
her
mistress
nor
the
marquise
could
receive
him
that
evening
calyste
much
surprised
wished
to
question
her
but
she
bade
him
hastily
and
closed
the
door
six
o
clock
was
striking
on
the
steeple
of
guerande
as
calyste
entered
his
own
house
where
mariotte
gave
him
his
belated
dinner
after
which
he
played
in
gloomy
meditation
these
alternations
of
joy
and
gloom
happiness
and
unhappiness
the
extinction
of
hopes
succeeding
the
apparent
certainty
of
being
loved
bruised
and
wounded
the
young
soul
which
had
flown
so
high
on
outstretched
wings
that
the
fall
was
dreadful
does
anything
trouble
you
my
calyste
said
his
mother
nothing
he
replied
looking
at
her
with
eyes
from
which
the
light
of
the
soul
and
the
fire
of
love
were
withdrawn
it
is
not
hope
but
despair
which
gives
the
measure
of
our
ambitions
the
finest
poems
of
hope
are
sung
in
secret
but
grief
appears
without
a
veil
calyste
you
are
not
nice
said
charlotte
after
vainly
attempting
on
him
those
little
provincial
witcheries
which
degenerate
usually
into
teasing
i
am
tired
he
said
rising
and
bidding
the
company
calyste
is
much
changed
remarked
mademoiselle
de
we
haven
t
beautiful
dresses
trimmed
with
lace
we
don
t
shake
our
sleeves
like
this
or
twist
our
bodies
like
that
we
don
t
know
how
to
give
sidelong
glances
and
turn
our
eyes
said
charlotte
mimicking
the
air
and
attitude
and
glances
of
the
marquise
haven
t
that
head
voice
nor
the
interesting
little
cough
heu
which
sounds
like
the
sigh
of
a
spook
have
the
misfortune
of
being
healthy
and
robust
and
of
loving
our
friends
without
coquetry
and
when
we
look
at
them
we
don
t
pretend
to
stick
a
dart
into
them
or
to
watch
them
slyly
can
t
bend
our
heads
like
a
weeping
willow
just
to
look
the
more
interesting
when
we
raise
them
this
mademoiselle
de
could
not
help
laughing
at
her
niece
s
gesture
but
neither
the
chevalier
nor
the
baron
paid
any
heed
to
this
truly
provincial
satire
against
paris
but
the
marquise
de
rochefide
is
a
very
handsome
woman
said
the
old
maid
my
dear
said
the
baroness
to
her
husband
i
happen
to
know
that
she
is
going
over
to
croisic
let
us
walk
on
the
jetty
i
should
like
to
see
while
calyste
was
racking
his
brains
to
imagine
what
could
have
closed
the
doors
of
les
touches
to
him
a
scene
was
passing
between
camille
and
beatrix
which
was
to
have
its
influence
on
the
events
of
the
morrow
calyste
s
last
letter
had
stirred
in
madame
de
rochefide
s
heart
emotions
hitherto
unknown
to
it
women
are
not
often
the
subject
of
a
love
so
young
guileless
sincere
and
unconditional
as
that
of
this
youth
this
child
beatrix
had
loved
more
than
she
had
been
loved
after
being
all
her
life
a
slave
she
suddenly
felt
an
inexplicable
desire
to
be
a
tyrant
but
in
the
midst
of
her
pleasure
as
she
read
and
the
letter
she
was
pierced
through
and
through
with
a
cruel
idea
what
were
calyste
and
camille
doing
together
ever
since
claude
vignon
s
departure
if
as
calyste
said
he
did
not
love
camille
and
if
camille
knew
it
how
did
they
employ
their
mornings
and
why
were
they
alone
together
memory
suddenly
flashed
into
her
mind
in
answer
to
these
questions
certain
speeches
of
camille
a
grinning
devil
seemed
to
show
her
as
in
a
magic
mirror
the
portrait
of
that
heroic
woman
with
certain
gestures
certain
aspects
which
suddenly
enlightened
her
what
instead
of
being
her
equal
was
she
crushed
by
felicite
instead
of
her
was
she
being
herself
was
she
only
a
toy
a
pleasure
which
camille
was
giving
to
her
child
whom
she
loved
with
an
extraordinary
passion
that
was
free
from
all
vulgarity
to
a
woman
like
beatrix
this
thought
came
like
a
she
went
over
in
her
mind
minutely
the
history
of
the
past
week
in
a
moment
the
part
which
camille
was
playing
and
her
own
unrolled
themselves
to
their
fullest
extent
before
her
eyes
she
felt
horribly
belittled
in
her
fury
of
jealous
anger
she
fancied
she
could
see
in
camille
s
conduct
an
intention
of
vengeance
against
conti
was
the
hidden
wrath
of
the
past
two
years
really
acting
upon
the
present
moment
once
on
the
path
of
these
doubts
and
superstitions
beatrix
did
not
pause
she
walked
up
and
down
her
room
driven
to
rapid
motion
by
the
impetuous
movements
of
her
soul
sitting
down
now
and
then
and
trying
to
decide
upon
a
course
but
unable
to
do
so
and
thus
she
remained
a
prey
to
indecision
until
the
dinner
hour
when
she
rose
hastily
and
went
downstairs
without
dressing
no
sooner
did
camille
see
her
than
she
felt
that
a
crisis
had
come
beatrix
in
her
morning
gown
with
a
chilling
air
and
a
taciturn
manner
indicated
to
an
observer
as
keen
as
maupin
the
coming
hostilities
of
an
embittered
heart
camille
instantly
left
the
room
and
gave
the
order
which
so
astonished
calyste
she
feared
that
he
might
arrive
in
the
midst
of
the
quarrel
and
she
determined
to
be
alone
without
witnesses
in
fighting
this
duel
of
deception
on
both
sides
beatrix
without
an
auxiliary
would
infallibly
succumb
camille
well
knew
the
barrenness
of
that
soul
the
pettiness
of
that
pride
to
which
she
had
justly
applied
the
epithet
of
obstinate
the
dinner
was
gloomy
camille
was
gentle
and
kind
she
felt
herself
the
superior
being
beatrix
was
hard
and
cutting
she
felt
she
was
being
managed
like
a
child
during
dinner
the
battle
began
with
glances
gestures
sentences
not
enough
to
enlighten
the
servants
but
enough
to
prepare
an
observer
for
the
coming
storm
when
the
time
to
go
upstairs
came
camille
offered
her
arm
maliciously
to
beatrix
who
pretended
not
to
see
it
and
sprang
up
the
stairway
alone
when
coffee
had
been
served
mademoiselle
des
touches
said
to
the
footman
you
may
go
a
brief
sentence
which
served
as
a
signal
for
the
combat
the
novels
you
make
my
dear
are
more
dangerous
than
those
you
write
said
the
marquise
they
have
one
advantage
however
replied
camille
lighting
a
cigarette
what
is
that
asked
beatrix
they
are
unpublished
my
is
the
one
in
which
you
are
putting
me
to
be
turned
into
a
book
i
ve
no
fancy
for
the
role
of
oedipus
i
know
you
have
the
wit
and
beauty
of
a
sphinx
but
don
t
propound
conundrums
speak
out
plainly
my
dear
when
in
order
to
make
a
man
happy
amuse
him
please
him
and
save
him
from
ennui
we
allow
the
devil
to
help
us
that
man
would
reproach
us
later
for
our
efforts
on
his
behalf
and
would
think
them
prompted
by
the
genius
of
depravity
said
camille
taking
the
cigarette
from
her
lips
to
interrupt
her
friend
he
forgets
the
love
which
carried
us
away
and
is
our
sole
justification
but
that
s
the
way
of
men
they
are
all
unjust
and
ungrateful
continued
beatrix
women
among
themselves
know
each
other
they
know
how
proud
and
noble
their
own
minds
are
and
let
us
frankly
say
so
how
virtuous
but
camille
i
have
just
recognized
the
truth
of
certain
criticisms
upon
your
nature
of
which
you
have
sometimes
complained
my
dear
you
have
something
of
the
man
about
you
you
behave
like
a
man
nothing
restrains
you
if
you
haven
t
all
a
man
s
advantages
you
have
a
man
s
spirit
in
all
your
ways
and
you
share
his
contempt
for
women
i
have
no
reason
my
dear
to
be
satisfied
with
you
and
i
am
too
frank
to
hide
my
dissatisfaction
no
one
has
ever
given
or
ever
will
give
perhaps
so
cruel
a
wound
to
my
heart
as
that
from
which
i
am
now
suffering
if
you
are
not
a
woman
in
love
you
are
one
in
vengeance
it
takes
a
of
genius
to
discover
the
most
sensitive
spot
of
all
in
another
woman
s
delicacy
i
am
talking
now
of
calyste
and
the
trickery
my
dear
that
is
the
word
you
have
employed
against
me
to
what
depths
have
you
descended
camille
maupin
and
why
more
and
more
said
camille
smiling
you
want
me
to
fling
myself
at
calyste
s
head
but
i
am
still
too
young
for
that
sort
of
thing
to
me
love
is
sacred
love
is
love
with
all
its
emotions
jealousies
and
despotisms
i
am
not
an
author
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
see
ideas
where
the
heart
feels
you
think
yourself
capable
of
loving
foolishly
said
camille
make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
you
still
have
plenty
of
sense
my
dear
you
calumniate
yourself
i
assure
you
that
your
nature
is
cold
enough
to
enable
your
head
to
judge
of
every
action
of
your
the
marquise
colored
high
she
darted
a
look
of
hatred
a
venomous
look
at
camille
and
found
without
searching
the
sharpest
arrows
in
her
quiver
camille
smoked
composedly
as
she
listened
to
a
furious
tirade
which
rang
with
such
cutting
insults
that
we
do
not
reproduce
it
here
beatrix
irritated
by
the
calmness
of
her
adversary
condescended
even
to
personalities
on
camille
s
age
is
that
all
said
felicite
when
beatrix
paused
letting
a
cloud
of
smoke
exhale
from
her
lips
do
you
love
calyste
no
of
course
so
much
the
better
replied
camille
i
do
love
him
far
too
much
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
he
may
perhaps
have
had
a
passing
fancy
for
you
for
you
are
you
know
enchantingly
fair
while
i
am
as
black
as
a
crow
you
are
slim
and
willowy
while
i
have
a
portly
dignity
in
short
you
are
that
s
the
final
word
and
you
have
not
spared
it
to
me
you
have
abused
your
advantages
as
a
woman
against
me
i
have
done
my
best
to
prevent
what
has
now
happened
however
little
of
a
woman
you
may
think
me
i
am
woman
enough
my
dear
not
to
allow
a
rival
to
triumph
over
me
unless
i
choose
to
help
this
remark
made
in
apparently
the
most
innocent
manner
cut
the
marquise
to
the
heart
you
take
me
for
a
very
silly
person
if
you
believe
all
that
calyste
tries
to
make
you
think
of
me
i
am
neither
so
great
nor
so
small
i
am
a
woman
and
very
much
of
a
woman
come
put
off
your
grand
airs
and
give
me
your
hand
continued
camille
taking
madame
de
rochefide
s
hand
you
do
not
love
calyste
you
say
that
is
true
is
it
not
don
t
be
angry
therefore
be
hard
and
cold
and
stern
to
him
he
will
end
by
submitting
to
his
fate
especially
after
certain
little
reproaches
which
i
mean
to
make
to
him
still
calyste
is
a
breton
and
very
persistent
if
he
should
continue
to
pay
court
to
you
tell
me
frankly
and
i
will
lend
you
my
little
country
house
near
paris
where
you
will
find
all
the
comforts
of
life
and
where
conti
can
come
out
and
see
you
you
said
just
now
that
calyste
calumniated
me
good
heavens
what
of
that
the
purest
love
lies
twenty
times
a
day
its
deceptions
only
prove
its
camille
s
face
wore
an
air
of
such
superb
disdain
that
the
marquise
grew
fearful
and
anxious
she
knew
not
how
to
answer
camille
dealt
her
a
last
blow
i
am
more
confiding
and
less
bitter
than
you
she
said
i
don
t
suspect
you
of
attempting
to
cover
by
a
quarrel
a
secret
injury
which
would
compromise
my
very
life
you
know
me
i
shall
never
survive
the
loss
of
calyste
but
i
must
lose
him
sooner
or
later
still
calyste
loves
me
now
of
that
i
am
here
is
what
he
answered
to
a
letter
of
mine
urging
him
to
be
true
to
you
said
beatrix
holding
out
calyste
s
last
letter
camille
took
it
and
read
it
but
as
she
read
it
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
presently
she
wept
as
women
weep
in
their
bitterest
sorrows
my
god
she
said
how
he
loves
her
i
shall
die
without
being
understood
or
loved
she
added
she
sat
for
a
few
moments
with
her
head
leaning
against
the
shoulder
of
her
companion
her
grief
was
genuine
she
felt
to
the
very
core
of
her
being
the
same
terrible
blow
which
the
baronne
du
guenic
had
received
in
reading
that
letter
do
you
love
him
she
said
straightening
herself
up
and
looking
fixedly
at
beatrix
have
you
that
infinite
worship
for
him
which
triumphs
over
all
pains
survives
contempt
betrayal
the
certainty
that
he
will
never
love
you
do
you
love
him
for
himself
and
for
the
very
joy
of
loving
him
dear
friend
said
the
marquise
tenderly
be
happy
be
at
peace
i
will
leave
this
place
no
do
not
go
he
loves
you
i
see
that
well
i
love
him
so
much
that
i
could
not
endure
to
see
him
wretched
and
unhappy
still
i
had
formed
plans
for
him
projects
but
if
he
loves
you
all
is
and
i
love
him
camille
said
the
marquise
with
a
sort
of
and
coloring
you
love
him
and
yet
you
cast
him
off
cried
camille
ah
that
is
not
loving
you
do
not
love
i
don
t
know
what
fresh
virtue
he
has
roused
in
me
but
certainly
he
has
made
me
ashamed
of
my
own
self
said
beatrix
i
would
i
were
virtuous
and
free
that
i
might
give
him
something
better
than
the
dregs
of
a
heart
and
the
weight
of
my
chains
i
do
not
want
a
hampered
destiny
either
for
him
or
for
cold
brain
exclaimed
camille
with
a
sort
of
horror
to
love
and
calculate
call
it
what
you
like
said
beatrix
but
i
will
not
spoil
his
life
or
hang
like
a
millstone
round
his
neck
to
become
an
eternal
regret
to
him
if
i
can
not
be
his
wife
i
shall
not
be
his
mistress
he
has
you
will
laugh
at
me
no
well
then
he
has
purified
camille
cast
on
beatrix
the
most
sullen
savage
look
that
female
jealousy
ever
cast
upon
a
rival
on
that
ground
i
believed
i
stood
alone
she
said
beatrix
those
words
of
yours
must
separate
us
forever
we
are
no
longer
friends
here
begins
a
terrible
conflict
between
us
i
tell
you
now
you
will
either
succumb
or
so
saying
camille
bounded
into
her
room
after
showing
her
face
which
was
that
of
a
maddened
lioness
to
the
astonished
beatrix
then
she
raised
the
portiere
and
looked
in
again
do
you
intend
to
go
to
croisic
she
asked
certainly
replied
the
marquise
proudly
i
shall
not
fly
and
i
shall
not
i
play
above
board
replied
camille
i
shall
write
to
beatrix
became
as
white
as
the
gauze
of
her
scarf
we
are
staking
our
lives
on
this
game
she
replied
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
the
violent
passions
roused
by
this
scene
between
the
two
women
calmed
down
during
the
night
both
argued
with
their
own
minds
and
returned
to
those
treacherously
temporizing
courses
which
are
so
attractive
to
the
majority
of
women
an
excellent
system
between
men
and
women
but
fatally
unsafe
among
women
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
tumult
of
their
souls
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
listened
to
that
great
voice
whose
counsels
subdue
the
strongest
will
beatrix
heard
only
the
promptings
of
worldly
wisdom
she
feared
the
contempt
of
society
thus
felicite
s
last
deception
succeeded
calyste
s
blunder
was
repaired
but
a
fresh
indiscretion
might
be
fatal
to
him
xiv
an
excursion
to
croisic
it
was
now
the
end
of
august
and
the
sky
was
magnificently
clear
near
the
horizon
the
sea
had
taken
as
it
is
wont
to
do
in
southern
climes
a
tint
of
molten
silver
on
the
shore
it
rippled
in
tiny
waves
a
sort
of
glowing
vapor
an
effect
of
the
rays
of
the
sun
falling
plumb
upon
the
sands
produced
an
atmosphere
like
that
of
the
tropics
the
salt
shone
up
like
bunches
of
white
violets
on
the
surface
of
the
marsh
the
patient
dressed
in
white
to
resist
the
action
of
the
sun
had
been
from
early
morning
at
their
posts
armed
with
long
rakes
some
were
leaning
on
the
low
that
divided
the
different
holdings
whence
they
watched
the
process
of
this
natural
chemistry
known
to
them
from
childhood
others
were
playing
with
their
wives
and
children
those
green
dragons
otherwise
called
officers
were
tranquilly
smoking
their
pipes
there
was
something
foreign
perhaps
oriental
about
the
scene
at
any
rate
a
parisian
suddenly
transported
thither
would
never
have
supposed
himself
in
france
the
baron
and
baroness
who
had
made
a
pretext
of
coming
to
see
how
the
salt
harvest
throve
were
on
the
jetty
admiring
the
silent
landscape
where
the
sea
alone
sounded
the
moan
of
her
waves
at
regular
intervals
where
boats
and
vessels
tracked
a
vast
expanse
and
the
girdle
of
green
earth
richly
cultivated
produced
an
effect
that
was
all
the
more
charming
because
so
rare
on
the
desolate
shores
of
ocean
well
my
friends
i
wanted
to
see
the
marshes
of
guerande
once
more
before
i
die
said
the
baron
to
the
who
had
gathered
about
the
entrance
of
the
marshes
to
salute
him
can
a
guenic
die
said
one
of
them
just
then
the
party
from
les
touches
arrived
through
the
narrow
pathway
the
marquise
walked
first
alone
calyste
and
camille
followed
gasselin
brought
up
the
rear
there
are
my
father
and
mother
said
the
young
man
to
camille
the
marquise
stopped
short
madame
du
guenic
felt
the
most
violent
repulsion
at
the
appearance
of
beatrix
although
the
latter
was
dressed
to
much
advantage
a
leghorn
hat
with
wide
brims
and
a
wreath
of
her
crimped
hair
fluffy
beneath
it
a
gown
of
some
gray
woollen
stuff
and
a
blue
sash
with
floating
ends
gave
her
the
air
of
a
princess
disguised
as
a
milkmaid
she
has
no
heart
thought
the
baroness
mademoiselle
said
calyste
to
camille
this
is
madame
du
guenic
and
this
is
my
then
he
said
turning
to
the
baron
and
baroness
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
madame
la
marquise
de
rochefide
de
casteran
the
baron
bowed
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
made
a
respectful
bow
full
of
gratitude
to
the
baroness
that
one
thought
fanny
really
loves
my
boy
she
seems
to
thank
me
for
bringing
him
into
the
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
see
as
i
have
whether
the
harvest
is
a
good
one
but
i
believe
you
have
better
reasons
for
doing
so
than
i
said
the
baron
to
camille
you
have
property
here
i
think
mademoiselle
is
the
largest
of
all
the
owners
said
one
of
the
who
were
grouped
about
them
and
may
god
preserve
her
to
us
for
she
s
a
the
two
parties
bowed
and
separated
no
one
would
suppose
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
be
more
than
thirty
said
the
baron
to
his
wife
she
is
very
handsome
and
calyste
prefers
that
haggard
parisian
marquise
to
a
sound
breton
girl
i
fear
he
does
replied
the
baroness
a
boat
was
waiting
at
the
steps
of
the
jetty
where
the
party
embarked
without
a
smile
the
marquise
was
cold
and
dignified
camille
had
lectured
calyste
on
his
disobedience
explaining
to
him
clearly
how
matters
stood
calyste
a
prey
to
black
despair
was
casting
glances
at
beatrix
in
which
anger
and
love
struggled
for
the
mastery
not
a
word
was
said
by
any
of
them
during
the
short
passage
from
the
jetty
of
guerande
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
port
of
croisic
the
point
where
the
boats
discharge
the
salt
which
the
then
bear
away
on
their
heads
in
huge
earthen
jars
after
the
fashion
of
caryatides
these
women
go
barefooted
with
very
short
petticoats
many
of
them
let
the
kerchiefs
which
cover
their
bosoms
fly
carelessly
open
some
wear
only
shifts
and
are
the
more
dignified
for
the
less
clothing
a
woman
wears
the
more
nobly
modest
is
her
bearing
the
little
danish
vessel
had
just
finished
lading
therefore
the
landing
of
the
two
handsome
ladies
excited
much
curiosity
among
the
female
and
as
much
to
avoid
their
remarks
as
to
serve
calyste
camille
sprang
forward
toward
the
rocks
leaving
him
to
follow
with
beatrix
while
gasselin
put
a
distance
of
some
two
hundred
steps
between
himself
and
his
master
the
peninsula
of
croisic
is
flanked
on
the
sea
side
by
granite
rocks
the
shapes
of
which
are
so
strangely
fantastic
that
they
can
only
be
appreciated
by
travellers
who
are
in
a
position
to
compare
them
with
other
great
spectacles
of
primeval
nature
perhaps
the
rocks
of
croisic
have
the
same
advantage
over
sights
of
that
kind
as
that
accorded
to
the
road
to
the
grande
chartreuse
over
all
other
narrow
valleys
neither
the
coasts
of
croisic
where
the
granite
bulwark
is
split
into
strange
reefs
nor
those
of
sardinia
where
nature
is
dedicated
to
grandiose
and
terrible
effects
nor
even
the
basaltic
rocks
of
the
northern
seas
can
show
a
character
so
unique
and
so
complete
fancy
has
here
amused
itself
by
composing
interminable
arabesques
where
the
most
fantastic
figures
wind
and
twine
all
forms
are
here
the
imagination
is
at
last
fatigued
by
this
vast
gallery
of
abnormal
shapes
where
in
stormy
weather
the
sea
makes
rough
assaults
which
have
ended
in
polishing
all
ruggedness
you
will
find
under
a
naturally
vaulted
roof
of
a
boldness
imitated
from
afar
by
brunelleschi
for
the
greatest
efforts
of
art
are
always
the
timid
copying
of
effects
of
nature
a
rocky
hollow
polished
like
a
marble
and
floored
with
fine
white
sand
in
which
is
four
feet
of
tepid
water
where
you
can
bathe
without
danger
you
walk
on
admiring
the
cool
little
covers
sheltered
by
great
portals
roughly
carved
it
is
true
but
majestic
like
the
pitti
palace
that
other
imitation
of
the
whims
of
nature
curious
features
are
innumerable
nothing
is
lacking
that
the
wildest
imagination
could
invent
or
desire
there
even
exists
a
thing
so
rare
on
the
rocky
shores
of
ocean
that
this
may
be
the
solitary
instance
of
it
a
large
bush
of
box
this
bush
the
greatest
curiosity
of
croisic
where
trees
have
never
grown
is
three
miles
distant
from
the
harbor
on
the
point
of
rocks
that
runs
farthest
into
the
sea
on
this
granite
promontory
which
rises
to
a
height
that
neither
the
waves
nor
the
spray
can
touch
even
in
the
wildest
weather

enough

earth
for
the
growth
of
a

the
shape
of
the

would
indicate
to
a
botanist
an
existence
of
at
least
three
hundred
years
above
it
the
rock
has
been
broken
off
abruptly
the
natural
convulsion
which
did
this
the
traces
of
which
are
ineffaceably
written
here
must
have
carried
away
the
broken
fragments
of
the
granite
i
know
not
where
the
sea
rushes
in
meeting
no
reefs
to
the
foot
of
this
cliff
which
rises
to
a
height
of
some
four
or
five
hundred
feet
at
its
base
lie
several
scattered
rocks

reaching
the
surface
at
high
water
and
describing

it
requires
some
nerve
and
resolution
to
climb
to
the
summit
of
this
little
gibraltar
the
shape
of
which
is
nearly
round
and
from
which
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
might
precipitate
the
rash
gazer
into
the
sea
or
still
more
to
be
feared
upon
the

this
gigantic
sentinel
resembles
the
towers
of
old
castles
from
which
the
inhabitants
could
look
the
country
over
and
foresee

thence
we
see
the
clock

the
arid
fields
of

with
the
sandy
dunes
which
injure

as
far

can
be
seen
far
out
at

a
name
but
it
is
useless
to
write
it
here
its
breton
consonants
being
as
difficult
to
pronounce
as
to
remember
calyste
led
beatrix
to
this
point
whence
the
view
is
magnificent
and
where
the
natural
sculpture
of
the
granite
is
even
more
imposing
to
the
spectator
than
the
mass
of
the
huge
breastwork
when
seen
from
the
sandy
road
which
skirts
the
shore
is
it
necessary
to
explain
why
camille
had
rushed
away
alone
like
some
wounded
wild
animal
she
longed
for
solitude
and
went
on
and
on
threading
her
way
among
the
fissures
and
caves
and
little
peaks
of
nature
s
fortress
not
to
be
hampered
in
climbing
by
women
s
clothing
she
wore
trousers
with
frilled
edges
a
short
blouse
a
peaked
cap
and
by
way
of
staff
she
carried
a
for
camille
has
always
had
a
certain
vanity
in
her
strength
and
her
agility
thus
arrayed
she
looked
far
handsomer
than
beatrix
she
wore
also
a
little
shawl
of
crimson
china
crape
crossed
on
her
bosom
and
tied
behind
as
they
dress
a
child
for
some
time
beatrix
and
calyste
saw
her
flitting
before
them
over
the
peaks
and
chasms
like
a
ghost
or
vision
she
was
trying
to
still
her
inward
sufferings
by
confronting
some
imaginary
peril
she
was
the
first
to
reach
the
rock
in
which
the
grew
there
she
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
a
granite
projection
and
was
lost
in
thought
what
could
a
woman
like
herself
do
with
old
age
having
already
drunk
the
cup
of
fame
which
all
great
talents
too
eager
to
sip
slowly
the
stupid
pleasures
of
vanity
quaff
at
a
single
draught
she
has
since
admitted
that
it
was
here
at
this
moment
and
on
this
spot
that
one
of
those
singular
reflections
suggested
by
a
mere
nothing
by
one
of
those
chance
accidents
that
seem
nonsense
to
common
minds
but
which
to
noble
souls
do
sometimes
open
vast
depths
of
thought
decided
her
to
take
the
extraordinary
step
by
which
she
was
to
part
forever
from
social
life
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
little
box
in
which
she
had
put
in
case
of
thirst
some
strawberry
lozenges
she
now
ate
several
and
as
she
did
so
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
that
the
strawberries
which
existed
no
longer
lived
nevertheless
in
their
qualities
was
it
not
so
with
ourselves
the
ocean
before
her
was
an
image
of
the
infinite
no
great
spirit
can
face
the
infinite
admitting
the
immortality
of
the
soul
without
the
conviction
of
a
future
of
holiness
the
thought
filled
her
mind
how
petty
then
seemed
the
part
that
she
was
playing
there
was
no
real
greatness
in
giving
beatrix
to
calyste
so
thinking
she
felt
the
earthly
woman
die
within
her
and
the
true
woman
the
noble
and
angelic
being
veiled
until
now
by
flesh
arose
in
her
place
her
great
mind
her
knowledge
her
attainments
her
false
loves
had
brought
her
face
to
face
with
what
ah
who
would
have
thought
it
with
the
bounteous
mother
the
comforter
of
troubled
spirits
with
the
roman
church
ever
kind
to
repentance
poetic
to
poets
childlike
with
children
and
yet
so
profound
so
full
of
mystery
to
anxious
restless
minds
that
they
can
burrow
there
and
satisfy
all
longings
all
questionings
all
hopes
she
cast
her
eyes
as
it
were
upon
the
strangely
devious
way
like
the
tortuous
rocky
path
before
her
over
which
her
love
for
calyste
had
led
her
ah
calyste
was
indeed
a
messenger
from
heaven
her
divine
conductor
she
had
stifled
earthly
love
and
a
divine
love
had
come
from
it
after
walking
for
some
distance
in
silence
calyste
could
not
refrain
on
a
remark
of
beatrix
about
the
grandeur
of
the
ocean
so
unlike
the
smiling
beauty
of
the
mediterranean
from
comparing
in
depth
purity
extent
unchanging
and
eternal
duration
that
ocean
with
his
love
it
is
met
by
a
rock
said
beatrix
laughing
when
you
speak
thus
he
answered
with
a
sublime
look
i
hear
you
i
see
you
and
i
can
summon
to
my
aid
the
patience
of
the
angels
but
when
i
am
alone
you
would
pity
me
if
you
could
see
me
then
my
mother
weeps
for
my
listen
to
me
calyste
we
must
put
an
end
to
all
this
said
the
marquise
gazing
down
upon
the
sandy
road
perhaps
we
have
now
reached
the
only
propitious
place
to
say
these
things
for
never
in
my
life
did
i
see
nature
more
in
keeping
with
my
thoughts
i
have
seen
italy
where
all
things
tell
of
love
i
have
seen
switzerland
where
all
is
cool
and
fresh
and
tells
of
happiness
the
happiness
of
labor
where
the
verdure
the
tranquil
waters
the
smiling
slopes
are
oppressed
by
the
alps
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
that
so
depicts
the
burning
barrenness
of
my
life
as
that
little
arid
plain
down
there
dried
by
the
salt
sea
winds
corroded
by
the
spray
where
a
fruitless
agriculture
tries
to
struggle
against
the
will
of
that
great
ocean
there
calyste
you
have
an
image
of
this
beatrix
don
t
cling
to
it
i
love
you
but
i
will
never
be
yours
in
any
way
whatever
for
i
have
the
sense
of
my
inward
desolation
ah
you
do
not
know
how
cruel
i
am
to
myself
in
speaking
thus
to
you
no
you
shall
never
see
your
idol
diminished
she
shall
never
fall
from
the
height
at
which
you
have
placed
her
i
now
have
a
horror
of
any
love
which
disregards
the
world
and
religion
i
shall
remain
in
my
present
bonds
i
shall
be
that
sandy
plain
we
see
before
us
without
fruit
or
flowers
or
but
if
you
are
abandoned
said
calyste
then
i
should
beg
my
pardon
of
the
man
i
have
offended
i
will
never
run
the
risk
of
taking
a
happiness
i
know
would
quickly
end
cried
calyste
the
marquise
stopped
the
passionate
speech
into
which
her
lover
was
about
to
launch
by
repeating
the
word
end
in
a
tone
that
silenced
him
this
opposition
roused
in
the
young
man
one
of
those
mute
inward
furies
known
only
to
those
who
love
without
hope
they
walked
on
several
hundred
steps
in
total
silence
looking
neither
at
the
sea
nor
the
rocks
nor
the
plain
of
croisic
i
would
make
you
happy
said
calyste
all
men
begin
by
promising
that
she
answered
and
they
end
by
abandonment
and
disgust
i
have
no
reproach
to
cast
on
him
to
whom
i
shall
be
faithful
he
made
me
no
promises
i
went
to
him
but
my
only
means
of
lessening
my
fault
is
to
make
it
say
rather
madame
that
you
feel
no
love
for
me
i
who
love
you
i
know
that
love
can
not
argue
it
is
itself
it
sees
nothing
else
there
is
no
sacrifice
i
will
not
make
to
you
command
it
and
i
will
do
the
impossible
he
who
despised
his
mistress
for
flinging
her
glove
among
the
lions
and
ordering
him
to
bring
it
back
to
her
did
not
he
denied
your
right
to
test
our
hearts
and
to
yield
yourselves
only
to
our
utmost
devotion
i
will
sacrifice
to
you
my
family
my
name
my
but
what
an
insult
in
that
word
sacrifice
she
said
in
reproachful
tones
which
made
poor
calyste
feel
the
folly
of
his
speech
none
but
women
who
truly
love
or
inborn
coquettes
know
how
to
use
a
word
as
a
point
from
which
to
make
a
spring
you
are
right
said
calyste
letting
fall
a
tear
that
word
can
only
be
said
of
the
cruel
struggles
which
you
ask
of
hush
said
beatrix
struck
by
an
answer
in
which
for
the
first
time
calyste
had
really
made
her
feel
his
love
i
have
done
wrong
enough
tempt
me
no
at
this
moment
they
had
reached
the
base
of
the
rock
on
which
grew
the
plant
of
box
calyste
felt
a
thrill
of
delight
as
he
helped
the
marquise
to
climb
the
steep
ascent
to
the
summit
which
she
wished
to
reach
to
the
poor
lad
it
was
a
precious
privilege
to
hold
her
up
to
make
her
lean
upon
him
to
feel
her
tremble
she
had
need
of
him
this
pleasure
turned
his
head
he
saw
nought
else
but
beatrix
and
he
clasped
her
round
the
waist
what
she
said
with
an
imposing
air
will
you
never
be
mine
he
demanded
in
a
voice
that
was
choked
by
the
tumult
of
his
blood
never
my
friend
she
replied
i
can
only
be
to
you
a
beatrix
a
dream
but
is
not
that
a
sweet
and
tender
thing
we
shall
have
no
bitterness
no
grief
no
will
you
return
to
conti
i
you
shall
never
belong
to
any
man
cried
calyste
pushing
her
from
him
with
frenzied
violence
he
listened
for
her
fall
intending
to
spring
after
her
but
he
heard
only
a
muffled
sound
the
tearing
of
some
stuff
and
then
the
thud
of
a
body
falling
on
the
ground
instead
of
being
flung
head
foremost
down
the
precipice
beatrix
had
only
slipped
some
eight
or
ten
feet
into
the
cavity
where
the
grew
but
she
might
from
there
have
rolled
down
into
the
sea
if
her
gown
had
not
caught
upon
a
point
of
rock
and
by
tearing
slowly
lowered
the
weight
of
her
body
upon
the
bush
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
saw
the
scene
was
unable
in
her
horror
to
cry
out
but
she
signed
to
gasselin
to
come
calyste
was
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
savage
curiosity
he
saw
the
position
in
which
beatrix
lay
and
he
shuddered
her
lips
moved
she
seemed
to
be
praying
in
fact
she
thought
she
was
about
to
die
for
she
felt
the
bush
beginning
to
give
way
with
the
agility
which
danger
gives
to
youth
calyste
slid
down
to
the
ledge
below
the
bush
where
he
was
able
to
grasp
the
marquise
and
hold
her
although
at
the
risk
of
their
both
sliding
down
into
the
sea
as
he
held
her
he
saw
that
she
had
fainted
but
in
that
aerial
spot
he
could
fancy
her
all
his
and
his
first
emotion
was
that
of
pleasure
open
your
eyes
he
said
and
forgive
me
we
will
die
die
she
said
opening
her
eyes
and
unclosing
her
pallid
lips
calyste
welcomed
that
word
with
a
kiss
and
felt
the
marquise
tremble
under
it
convulsively
with
passionate
joy
at
that
instant
gasselin
s
shoes
sounded
on
the
rock
above
them
the
old
breton
was
followed
by
camille
and
together
they
sought
for
some
means
of
saving
the
lovers
there
s
but
one
way
mademoiselle
said
gasselin
i
must
slide
down
there
and
they
can
climb
on
my
shoulders
and
you
must
pull
them
and
you
said
camille
the
man
seemed
surprised
that
he
should
be
considered
in
presence
of
the
danger
to
his
young
master
you
must
go
to
croisic
and
fetch
a
ladder
said
camille
beatrix
asked
in
a
feeble
voice
to
be
laid
down
and
calyste
placed
her
on
the
narrow
space
between
the
bush
and
its
background
of
rock
i
saw
you
calyste
said
camille
from
above
whether
beatrix
lives
or
dies
remember
that
this
must
be
an
she
will
hate
me
he
said
with
moistened
eyes
she
will
adore
you
replied
camille
but
this
puts
an
end
to
our
excursion
we
must
get
her
back
to
les
touches
had
she
been
killed
calyste
what
would
have
become
of
you
i
should
have
followed
and
your
mother
then
after
a
pause
she
added
feebly
and
me
calyste
was
deadly
pale
he
stood
with
his
back
against
the
granite
motionless
and
silent
gasselin
soon
returned
from
one
of
the
little
farms
scattered
through
the
neighborhood
bearing
a
ladder
which
he
had
borrowed
by
this
time
beatrix
had
recovered
a
little
strength
the
ladder
being
placed
she
was
able
by
the
help
of
gasselin
who
lowered
camille
s
red
shawl
till
she
could
grasp
it
to
reach
the
round
top
of
the
rock
where
the
breton
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
shore
as
though
she
were
an
infant
i
should
not
have
said
no
to
death
but
suffering
she
murmured
to
felicite
in
a
feeble
voice
the
weakness
in
fact
the
complete
prostration
of
the
marquise
obliged
camille
to
have
her
taken
to
the
farmhouse
from
which
the
ladder
had
been
borrowed
calyste
gasselin
and
camille
took
off
what
clothes
they
could
spare
and
laid
them
on
the
ladder
making
a
sort
of
litter
on
which
they
carried
beatrix
the
farmers
gave
her
a
bed
gasselin
then
went
to
the
place
where
the
carriage
was
awaiting
them
and
taking
one
of
the
horses
rode
to
croisic
to
obtain
a
doctor
telling
the
boatman
to
row
to
the
that
was
nearest
to
the
farmhouse
calyste
sitting
on
a
stool
answered
only
by
motions
of
the
head
and
rare
monosyllables
when
spoken
to
camille
s
uneasiness
roused
for
beatrix
was
still
further
excited
by
calyste
s
unnatural
condition
when
the
physician
arrived
and
beatrix
was
bled
she
felt
better
began
to
talk
and
consented
to
embark
so
that
by
five
o
clock
they
reached
the
jetty
at
guerande
whence
she
was
carried
to
les
touches
the
news
of
the
accident
had
already
spread
through
that
lonely
and
almost
uninhabited
region
with
incredible
rapidity
calyste
passed
the
night
at
les
touches
sitting
at
the
foot
of
beatrix
s
bed
in
company
with
camille
the
doctor
from
guerande
had
assured
them
that
on
the
following
day
a
little
stiffness
would
be
all
that
remained
of
the
accident
across
the
despair
of
calyste
s
heart
there
came
a
gleam
of
joy
he
was
there
at
her
feet
he
could
watch
her
sleeping
or
waking
he
might
study
her
pallid
face
and
all
its
expressions
camille
smiled
bitterly
as
her
keen
mind
recognized
in
calyste
the
symptoms
of
a
passion
such
as
man
can
feel
but
once
a
passion
which
dyes
his
soul
and
his
faculties
by
mingling
with
the
fountain
of
his
life
at
a
period
when
neither
thoughts
nor
cares
distract
or
oppose
the
inward
working
of
this
emotion
she
saw
that
calyste
would
never
could
never
see
the
real
woman
that
was
in
beatrix
and
with
what
guileless
innocence
the
young
breton
allowed
his
thoughts
to
be
read
when
he
saw
the
beautiful
green
eyes
of
the
sick
woman
turned
to
him
expressing
a
mixture
of
love
confusion
and
even
mischief
he
colored
and
turned
away
his
head
did
i
not
say
truly
calyste
that
you
men
promised
happiness
and
ended
by
flinging
us
down
a
precipice
when
he
heard
this
little
jest
said
in
sweet
caressing
tones
which
betrayed
a
change
of
heart
in
beatrix
calyste
knelt
down
took
her
moist
hand
which
she
yielded
to
him
and
kissed
it
humbly
you
have
the
right
to
reject
my
love
forever
he
said
and
i
i
have
no
right
to
say
one
word
to
ah
cried
camille
seeing
the
expression
on
beatrix
s
face
and
comparing
it
with
that
obtained
by
her
diplomacy
love
has
a
wit
of
its
own
wiser
than
that
of
all
the
world
take
your
my
dear
friend
and
go
to
that
night
spent
by
calyste
beside
mademoiselle
des
touches
who
read
a
book
of
theological
mysticism
while
calyste
read
indiana
the
first
work
of
camille
s
celebrated
rival
in
which
is
the
captivating
image
of
a
young
man
loving
with
idolatry
and
devotion
with
mysterious
tranquillity
and
for
all
his
life
a
woman
placed
in
the
same
false
position
as
beatrix
a
book
which
had
a
fatal
influence
upon
him
that
night
left
ineffaceable
marks
upon
the
heart
of
the
poor
young
fellow
whom
felicite
soothed
with
the
assurance
that
unless
a
woman
were
a
monster
she
must
be
flattered
in
all
her
vanities
by
being
the
object
of
such
a
crime
you
would
never
have
flung
into
the
water
said
camille
brushing
away
a
tear
toward
morning
calyste
with
emotion
fell
asleep
in
his
and
the
marquise
in
her
turn
watched
his
charming
face
paled
by
his
feelings
and
his
vigil
of
love
she
heard
him
murmur
her
name
as
he
slept
he
loves
while
sleeping
she
said
to
camille
we
must
send
him
home
said
felicite
waking
him
no
one
was
anxious
at
the
hotel
du
guenic
for
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
written
a
line
to
the
baroness
telling
her
of
the
accident
calyste
returned
to
dinner
at
les
touches
and
found
beatrix
up
and
dressed
but
pale
feeble
and
languid
no
longer
was
there
any
harshness
in
her
words
or
any
coldness
in
her
looks
after
this
evening
filled
with
music
by
camille
who
went
to
her
piano
to
leave
calyste
free
to
take
and
press
the
hands
of
beatrix
though
both
were
unable
to
speak
no
storms
occurred
at
les
touches
felicite
completely
effaced
herself
cold
fragile
thin
hard
women
like
madame
de
rochefide
women
whose
necks
turn
in
a
manner
to
give
them
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
feline
race
have
souls
of
the
same
pale
tint
as
their
light
eyes
green
or
gray
and
to
melt
them
to
fuse
those
blocks
of
stone
it
needs
a
thunderbolt
to
beatrix
calyste
s
fury
of
love
and
his
mad
action
came
as
the
thunderbolt
that
nought
resists
which
changes
all
natures
even
the
most
stubborn
she
felt
herself
inwardly
humbled
a
true
pure
love
bathed
her
heart
with
its
soft
and
limpid
warmth
she
breathed
a
sweet
and
genial
atmosphere
of
feelings
hitherto
unknown
to
her
by
which
she
felt
herself
magnified
elevated
in
fact
she
rose
into
that
heaven
where
bretons
throughout
all
time
have
placed
the
woman
she
relished
with
delight
the
respectful
adoration
of
the
youth
whose
happiness
cost
her
little
for
a
gesture
a
look
a
word
was
enough
to
satisfy
him
the
value
which
calyste
s
heart
gave
to
these
trifles
touched
her
exceedingly
to
hold
her
gloved
hand
was
more
to
that
young
angel
than
the
possession
of
her
whole
person
to
the
man
who
ought
to
have
been
faithful
to
her
what
a
contrast
between
them
few
women
could
resist
such
constant
deification
beatrix
felt
herself
sure
of
being
obeyed
and
understood
she
might
have
asked
calyste
to
risk
his
life
for
the
slightest
of
her
caprices
and
he
would
never
have
reflected
for
a
moment
this
consciousness
gave
her
a
certain
noble
and
imposing
air
she
saw
love
on
the
side
of
its
grandeur
and
her
heart
sought
for
some
foothold
on
which
she
might
remain
forever
the
loftiest
of
women
in
the
eyes
of
her
young
lover
over
whom
she
now
wished
her
power
to
be
eternal
her
coquetries
became
the
more
persistent
because
she
felt
within
herself
a
certain
weakness
she
played
the
invalid
for
a
whole
week
with
charming
hypocrisy
again
and
again
she
walked
about
the
velvet
turf
which
lay
between
the
house
and
garden
leaning
on
calyste
s
arm
in
languid
dependence
ah
my
dear
you
are
taking
him
a
long
journey
in
a
small
space
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
one
day
before
the
excursion
to
croisic
the
two
women
were
discoursing
one
evening
about
love
and
laughing
at
the
different
ways
that
men
adopted
to
declare
it
admitting
to
themselves
that
the
cleverest
men
and
naturally
the
least
loving
did
not
like
to
wander
in
the
labyrinths
of
sentimentality
and
went
straight
to
the
point
in
which
perhaps
they
were
right
for
the
result
was
that
those
who
loved
most
deeply
and
reservedly
were
for
a
time
at
least
they
go
to
work
like
la
fontaine
when
he
wanted
to
enter
the
academy
said
camille
madame
de
rochefide
had
unbounded
power
to
restrain
calyste
within
the
limits
where
she
meant
to
keep
him
it
sufficed
her
to
remind
him
by
a
look
or
gesture
of
his
horrible
violence
on
the
rocks
the
eyes
of
her
poor
victim
would
fill
with
tears
he
was
silent
swallowing
down
his
prayers
his
arguments
his
sufferings
with
a
heroism
that
would
certainly
have
touched
any
other
woman
she
finally
brought
him
by
her
infernal
coquetry
to
such
a
pass
that
he
went
one
day
to
camille
imploring
her
advice
beatrix
armed
with
calyste
s
own
letter
quoted
the
passage
in
which
he
said
that
to
love
was
the
first
happiness
that
of
being
loved
came
later
and
she
used
that
axiom
to
restrain
his
passion
to
the
limits
of
respectful
idolatry
which
pleased
her
well
she
liked
to
feel
her
soul
caressed
by
those
sweet
hymns
of
praise
and
adoration
which
nature
suggests
to
youth
in
them
is
so
much
artless
art
such
innocent
seduction
is
in
their
cries
their
prayers
their
exclamations
their
pledges
of
themselves
in
the
promissory
notes
which
they
offer
on
the
future
to
all
of
which
beatrix
was
very
careful
to
give
no
definite
answer
yes
she
heard
him
but
she
doubted
love
was
not
yet
the
question
what
he
asked
of
her
was
permission
to
love
in
fact
that
was
all
the
poor
lad
really
asked
for
his
mind
still
clung
to
the
strongest
side
of
love
the
spiritual
side
but
the
woman
who
is
firmest
in
words
is
often
the
feeblest
in
action
it
is
strange
that
calyste
having
seen
the
progress
his
suit
had
made
by
pushing
beatrix
into
the
sea
did
not
continue
to
urge
it
violently
but
love
in
young
men
is
so
ecstatic
and
religious
that
their
inmost
desire
is
to
win
its
fruition
through
moral
conviction
in
that
is
the
sublimity
of
their
love
nevertheless
the
day
came
when
the
breton
driven
to
desperation
complained
to
camille
of
beatrix
s
conduct
i
meant
to
cure
you
by
making
you
quickly
understand
her
replied
mademoiselle
des
touches
but
you
have
spoiled
all
ten
days
ago
you
were
her
master
my
poor
boy
you
are
her
slave
you
will
never
have
the
strength
now
to
do
as
i
what
ought
i
to
do
quarrel
with
her
on
the
ground
of
her
hardness
a
woman
is
always
when
she
discusses
let
her
be
angry
and
you
and
then
stay
away
do
not
return
to
les
touches
till
she
herself
recalls
in
all
extreme
illness
there
is
a
moment
when
the
patient
is
willing
to
accept
the
cruellest
remedy
and
submits
to
the
most
horrible
operation
calyste
had
reached
that
point
he
listened
to
camille
s
advice
and
stayed
at
home
two
whole
days
but
on
the
third
he
was
scratching
at
beatrix
s
door
to
let
her
know
that
he
and
camille
were
waiting
breakfast
for
her
another
chance
lost
camille
said
to
him
when
she
saw
him
so
weakly
during
his
two
days
absence
beatrix
had
frequently
looked
through
the
window
which
opens
on
the
road
to
guerande
when
camille
found
her
doing
so
she
talked
of
the
effect
produced
by
the
gorse
along
the
roadway
the
golden
blooms
of
which
were
dazzling
in
the
september
sunshine
the
marquise
kept
camille
and
calyste
waiting
long
for
breakfast
and
the
delay
would
have
been
significant
to
any
eyes
but
those
of
calyste
for
when
she
did
appear
her
dress
showed
an
evident
intention
to
fascinate
him
and
prevent
another
absence
after
breakfast
she
went
to
walk
with
him
in
the
garden
and
filled
his
simple
heart
with
joy
by
expressing
a
wish
to
go
again
to
that
rock
where
she
had
so
nearly
perished
will
you
go
with
me
alone
asked
calyste
in
a
troubled
voice
if
i
refused
to
do
so
she
replied
i
should
give
you
reason
to
suppose
i
thought
you
dangerous
alas
as
i
have
told
you
again
and
again
i
belong
to
another
and
i
must
be
his
only
i
chose
him
knowing
nothing
of
love
the
fault
was
great
and
bitter
is
my
when
she
talked
thus
her
eyes
moist
with
the
scanty
tears
shed
by
that
class
of
woman
calyste
was
filled
with
a
compassion
that
reduced
his
fiery
ardor
he
adored
her
then
as
he
did
a
madonna
we
have
no
more
right
to
require
different
characters
to
be
alike
in
the
expression
of
feelings
than
we
have
to
expect
the
same
fruits
from
different
trees
beatrix
was
at
this
moment
undergoing
an
inward
struggle
she
hesitated
between
herself
and
calyste
between
the
world
she
still
hoped
to
and
the
young
happiness
offered
to
her
between
a
second
and
an
unpardonable
love
and
social
rehabilitation
she
began
therefore
to
listen
without
even
acted
displeasure
to
the
talk
of
the
youth
s
blind
passion
she
allowed
his
soft
pity
to
soothe
her
several
times
she
had
been
moved
to
tears
as
she
listened
to
calyste
s
promises
and
she
suffered
him
to
commiserate
her
for
being
bound
to
an
evil
genius
a
man
as
false
as
conti
more
than
once
she
related
to
him
the
misery
and
anguish
she
had
gone
through
in
italy
when
she
first
became
aware
that
she
was
not
alone
in
conti
s
heart
on
this
subject
camille
had
fully
informed
calyste
and
given
him
several
lectures
on
it
by
which
he
profited
i
he
said
will
love
you
only
you
absolutely
i
have
no
triumphs
of
art
no
applause
of
crowds
stirred
by
my
genius
to
offer
you
my
only
talent
is
to
love
you
my
honor
my
pride
are
in
your
perfections
no
other
woman
can
have
merit
in
my
eyes
you
have
no
odious
rivalry
to
fear
you
are
misconceived
and
wronged
but
i
know
you
and
for
every
misconception
for
every
wrong
i
will
make
you
feel
my
comprehension
day
by
she
listened
to
such
speeches
with
bowed
head
allowing
him
to
kiss
her
hands
and
admitting
silently
but
gracefully
that
she
was
indeed
an
angel
misunderstood
i
am
too
humiliated
she
would
say
my
past
has
robbed
the
future
of
all
it
was
a
glorious
day
for
calyste
when
arriving
at
les
touches
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
saw
from
afar
beatrix
at
a
window
watching
for
him
and
wearing
the
same
straw
hat
she
had
worn
on
the
memorable
day
of
their
first
excursion
for
a
moment
he
was
dazzled
and
giddy
these
little
things
of
passion
magnify
the
world
itself
it
may
be
that
only
frenchwomen
possess
the
art
of
such
scenic
effects
they
owe
it
to
the
grace
of
their
minds
they
know
how
to
put
into
sentiment
as
much
of
the
picturesque
as
the
particular
sentiment
can
bear
without
a
loss
of
vigor
or
of
force
ah
how
lightly
she
rested
on
calyste
s
arm
together
they
left
les
touches
by
the
which
opens
on
the
dunes
beatrix
thought
the
sands
delightful
she
spied
the
hardy
little
plants
with
flowers
that
grew
there
and
she
gathered
a
quantity
to
mix
with
the
chartreux
pansies
which
also
grow
in
that
arid
desert
dividing
them
significantly
with
calyste
to
whom
those
flowers
and
their
foliage
were
to
be
henceforth
an
eternal
and
dreadful
relic
we
ll
add
a
bit
of
box
she
said
smiling
they
sat
some
time
together
on
the
jetty
and
calyste
while
waiting
for
the
boat
to
come
over
told
her
of
his
juvenile
act
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
i
knew
of
your
little
escapade
she
said
and
it
was
the
cause
of
my
sternness
to
you
that
first
during
their
walk
madame
de
rochefide
had
the
lightly
jesting
tone
of
a
woman
who
loves
together
with
a
certain
tenderness
and
abandonment
of
manner
calyste
had
reason
to
think
himself
beloved
but
when
wandering
along
the
shore
beneath
the
rocks
they
came
upon
one
of
those
charming
creeks
where
the
waves
deposit
the
most
extraordinary
mosaic
of
brilliant
pebbles
and
they
played
there
like
children
gathering
the
prettiest
when
calyste
at
the
summit
of
happiness
asked
her
plainly
to
fly
with
him
to
ireland
she
resumed
her
dignified
and
distant
air
asked
for
his
arm
and
continued
their
walk
in
silence
to
what
she
called
her
tarpeian
rock
my
friend
she
said
mounting
with
slow
steps
the
magnificent
block
of
granite
of
which
she
was
making
for
herself
a
pedestal
i
have
not
the
courage
to
conceal
what
you
are
to
me
for
ten
years
i
have
had
no
happiness
comparable
to
that
which
we
have
just
enjoyed
together
searching
for
shells
among
those
rocks
exchanging
pebbles
of
which
i
shall
make
a
necklace
more
precious
far
to
me
than
if
it
were
made
of
the
finest
diamonds
i
have
been
once
more
a
little
girl
a
child
such
as
i
was
at
fourteen
or
sixteen
when
i
was
worthy
of
you
the
love
i
have
had
the
happiness
to
inspire
in
your
heart
has
raised
me
in
my
own
eyes
understand
these
words
to
their
magical
extent
you
have
made
me
the
proudest
and
happiest
of
my
sex
and
you
will
live
longer
in
my
remembrance
perhaps
than
i
in
at
this
moment
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
rock
whence
they
saw
the
vast
ocean
on
one
side
and
brittany
on
the
other
with
its
golden
isles
its
feudal
towers
and
its
gorse
never
did
any
woman
stand
on
a
finer
scene
to
make
a
great
avowal
but
she
continued
i
do
not
belong
to
myself
i
am
more
bound
by
my
own
will
than
i
was
by
the
law
you
must
be
punished
for
my
misdeed
but
be
satisfied
to
know
that
we
suffer
together
dante
never
saw
his
beatrice
again
petrarch
never
possessed
his
laura
such
disasters
fall
on
none
but
noble
souls
but
if
i
should
be
abandoned
if
i
fall
lower
yet
into
shame
and
ignominy
if
your
beatrix
is
cruelly
misjudged
by
the
world
she
loathes
if
indeed
she
is
the
lowest
of
women
then
my
child
my
adored
child
she
said
taking
his
hand
to
you
she
will
still
be
first
of
all
you
will
know
that
she
rises
to
heaven
as
she
leans
on
you
but
then
my
friend
she
added
giving
him
an
intoxicating
look
then
if
you
wish
to
cast
her
down
do
not
fail
of
your
blow
after
your
love
death
calyste
clasped
her
round
the
waist
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
as
if
to
confirm
her
words
madame
de
rochefide
laid
a
tender
timid
kiss
upon
his
brow
when
they
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
talking
together
like
those
who
have
a
perfect
comprehension
of
each
other
she
thinking
she
had
gained
a
truce
he
not
doubting
of
his
happiness
and
both
deceived
calyste
from
what
camille
had
told
him
was
confident
that
conti
would
be
enchanted
to
find
an
opportunity
to
part
from
beatrix
beatrix
yielding
herself
up
to
the
vagueness
of
her
position
looked
to
chance
to
arrange
the
future
they
reached
les
touches
in
the
most
delightful
of
all
states
of
mind
entering
by
the
garden
gate
the
key
of
which
calyste
had
taken
with
him
it
was
nearly
six
o
clock
the
luscious
odors
the
warm
atmosphere
the
burnished
rays
of
the
evening
sun
were
all
in
harmony
with
their
feelings
and
their
tender
talk
their
steps
were
taken
in
unison
the
gait
of
all
lovers
their
movements
told
of
the
union
of
their
thoughts
the
silence
that
reigned
about
les
touches
was
so
profound
that
the
noise
which
calyste
made
in
opening
and
shutting
the
gate
must
have
echoed
through
the
garden
as
the
two
had
said
all
to
each
other
that
could
be
said
and
as
their
day
s
excursion
so
filled
with
emotion
had
physically
tired
them
they
walked
slowly
saying
nothing
suddenly
at
the
turn
of
a
path
beatrix
was
seized
with
a
horrible
trembling
with
that
contagious
horror
which
is
caused
by
the
sight
of
a
snake
and
which
calyste
felt
before
he
saw
the
cause
of
it
on
a
bench
beneath
the
branches
of
a
weeping
ash
sat
conti
talking
with
camille
maupin
xv
conti
the
inward
and
convulsive
trembling
of
the
marquise
was
more
apparent
than
she
wished
it
to
be
a
tragic
drama
developed
at
that
moment
in
the
souls
of
all
present
you
did
not
expect
me
so
soon
i
fancy
said
conti
offering
his
arm
to
beatrix
the
marquise
could
not
avoid
dropping
calyste
s
arm
and
taking
that
of
conti
this
ignoble
transit
imperiously
demanded
so
dishonoring
to
the
new
love
overwhelmed
calyste
who
threw
himself
on
the
bench
beside
camille
after
exchanging
the
coldest
of
salutations
with
his
rival
he
was
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
strong
in
the
thought
that
beatrix
loved
him
he
wanted
at
first
to
fling
himself
upon
conti
and
tell
him
that
beatrix
was
his
but
the
violent
trembling
of
the
woman
betraying
how
she
suffered
for
she
had
really
paid
the
penalty
of
her
faults
in
that
one
moment
affected
him
so
deeply
that
he
was
dumb
struck
like
her
with
a
sense
of
some
implacable
necessity
madame
de
rochefide
and
conti
passed
in
front
of
the
seat
where
calyste
had
dropped
beside
camille
and
as
she
passed
the
marquise
looked
at
camille
giving
her
one
of
those
terrible
glances
in
which
women
have
the
art
of
saying
all
things
she
avoided
the
eyes
of
calyste
and
turned
her
attention
to
conti
who
appeared
to
be
jesting
with
her
what
will
they
say
to
each
other
calyste
asked
of
camille
dear
child
you
don
t
know
as
yet
the
terrible
rights
which
an
extinguished
love
still
gives
to
a
man
over
a
woman
beatrix
could
not
refuse
to
take
his
arm
he
is
no
doubt
joking
her
about
her
new
love
he
must
have
guessed
it
from
your
attitudes
and
the
manner
in
which
you
approached
joking
her
cried
the
impetuous
youth
starting
up
be
calm
said
camille
or
you
will
lose
the
last
chances
that
remain
to
you
if
he
wounds
her
she
will
crush
him
like
a
worm
under
her
foot
but
he
is
too
astute
for
that
he
will
manage
her
with
greater
cleverness
he
will
seem
not
even
to
suppose
that
the
proud
madame
de
rochefide
could
betray
him
could
never
be
guilty
of
such
depravity
as
loving
a
man
for
the
sake
of
his
beauty
he
will
represent
you
to
her
as
a
child
ambitious
to
have
a
marquise
in
love
with
him
and
to
make
himself
the
arbiter
of
the
fate
of
two
women
in
short
he
will
fire
a
broadside
of
malicious
insinuations
beatrix
will
then
be
forced
to
parry
with
false
assertions
and
denials
which
he
will
simply
make
use
of
to
become
once
more
her
ah
cried
calyste
he
does
not
love
her
i
would
leave
her
free
true
love
means
a
choice
made
anew
at
every
moment
confirmed
from
day
to
day
the
morrow
justifies
the
past
and
swells
the
treasury
of
our
pleasures
ah
why
did
he
not
stay
away
a
little
longer
a
few
days
more
and
he
would
not
have
found
her
what
brought
him
back
the
jest
of
a
journalist
replied
camille
his
opera
on
the
success
of
which
he
counted
has
fallen
flat
some
journalist
probably
claude
vignon
remarked
in
the
foyer
it
is
hard
to
lose
fame
and
mistress
at
the
same
moment
and
the
speech
cut
him
in
all
his
vanities
love
based
on
petty
sentiments
is
always
pitiless
i
have
questioned
him
but
who
can
fathom
a
nature
so
false
and
deceiving
he
appeared
to
be
weary
of
his
troubles
and
his
love
in
short
disgusted
with
life
he
regrets
having
allied
himself
so
publicly
with
the
marquise
and
made
me
in
speaking
of
his
past
happiness
a
melancholy
poem
which
was
somewhat
too
clever
to
be
true
i
think
he
hoped
to
worm
out
of
me
the
secret
of
your
love
in
the
midst
of
the
joy
he
expected
his
flatteries
to
cause
what
else
said
calyste
watching
beatrix
and
conti
who
were
now
coming
towards
them
but
he
listened
no
longer
to
camille
s
words
in
talking
with
conti
camille
had
held
herself
prudently
on
the
defensive
she
had
betrayed
neither
calyste
s
secret
nor
that
of
beatrix
the
great
artist
was
capable
of
treachery
to
every
one
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
warned
calyste
to
distrust
him
my
dear
friend
she
said
this
is
by
far
the
most
critical
moment
for
you
you
need
caution
and
a
sort
of
cleverness
you
do
not
possess
i
am
afraid
you
will
let
yourself
be
tricked
by
the
most
wily
man
i
have
ever
known
and
i
can
do
nothing
to
help
the
bell
announced
dinner
conti
offered
his
arm
to
camille
calyste
gave
his
to
beatrix
camille
drew
back
to
let
the
marquise
pass
but
the
latter
had
found
a
moment
in
which
to
look
at
calyste
and
impress
upon
him
by
putting
her
finger
on
her
lips
the
absolute
necessity
of
discretion
conti
was
extremely
gay
during
the
dinner
perhaps
this
was
only
one
way
of
probing
madame
de
rochefide
who
played
her
part
extremely
ill
if
her
conduct
had
been
mere
coquetry
she
might
have
deceived
even
conti
but
her
new
love
was
real
and
it
betrayed
her
the
wily
musician
far
from
adding
to
her
embarrassment
pretended
not
to
have
perceived
it
at
dessert
he
brought
the
conversation
round
to
women
and
lauded
the
nobility
of
their
sentiments
many
a
woman
he
said
who
might
have
been
willing
to
abandon
a
man
in
prosperity
would
sacrifice
all
to
him
in
misfortune
women
had
the
advantage
over
men
in
constancy
nothing
ever
detached
them
from
their
first
lover
to
whom
they
clung
as
a
matter
of
honor
unless
he
wounded
them
they
felt
that
a
second
love
was
unworthy
of
them
and
so
forth
his
ethics
were
of
the
highest
order
shedding
incense
on
the
altar
where
he
knew
that
one
heart
at
least
pierced
by
many
a
blow
was
bleeding
camille
and
beatrix
alone
understood
the
bitterness
of
the
sarcasms
shot
forth
in
the
guise
of
eulogy
at
times
they
both
flushed
scarlet
but
they
were
forced
to
control
themselves
when
dinner
was
over
they
took
each
other
by
the
arm
to
return
to
camille
s
salon
and
as
if
by
mutual
consent
they
turned
aside
into
the
great
salon
where
they
could
be
alone
for
an
instant
in
the
darkness
it
is
dreadful
to
let
conti
ride
over
me
roughshod
and
yet
i
can
t
defend
myself
said
beatrix
in
a
low
voice
the
is
always
a
slave
to
his
i
am
lost
i
must
needs
return
to
my
galleys
and
it
is
you
camille
who
have
cast
me
there
ah
you
brought
him
back
a
day
too
soon
or
a
day
too
late
i
recognize
your
infernal
talent
as
author
well
your
revenge
is
complete
the
finale
perfect
i
may
have
told
you
that
i
would
write
to
conti
but
to
do
it
was
another
matter
cried
camille
i
am
incapable
of
such
baseness
but
you
are
unhappy
and
i
will
forgive
the
what
will
become
of
calyste
said
the
marquise
with
naive
then
conti
carries
you
off
does
he
asked
camille
ah
you
think
you
triumph
cried
beatrix
anger
distorted
her
handsome
face
as
she
said
those
bitter
words
to
camille
who
was
trying
to
hide
her
satisfaction
under
a
false
expression
of
sympathy
unfortunately
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
belied
the
sadness
of
her
face
and
beatrix
was
learned
in
such
deceptions
when
a
few
moments
later
the
two
women
were
seated
under
a
strong
light
on
that
divan
where
the
first
three
weeks
so
many
comedies
had
been
played
and
where
the
secret
tragedy
of
many
thwarted
passions
had
begun
they
examined
each
other
for
the
last
time
and
felt
they
were
forever
parted
by
an
undying
hatred
calyste
remains
to
you
said
beatrix
looking
into
camille
s
eyes
but
i
am
fixed
in
his
heart
and
no
woman
can
ever
drive
me
out
of
camille
replied
with
an
inimitable
tone
of
irony
that
struck
the
marquise
to
the
heart
in
the
famous
words
of
mazarin
s
niece
to
louis
you
reign
you
love
and
you
depart
neither
camille
nor
beatrix
was
conscious
during
this
sharp
and
bitter
scene
of
the
absence
of
conti
and
calyste
the
composer
had
remained
at
table
with
his
rival
begging
him
to
keep
him
company
in
finishing
a
bottle
of
champagne
we
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
added
conti
to
prevent
all
refusal
on
the
part
of
calyste
placed
as
they
both
were
it
was
impossible
for
the
young
breton
to
refuse
this
challenge
my
dear
friend
said
the
composer
in
his
most
caressing
voice
as
soon
as
the
poor
lad
had
drunk
a
couple
of
glasses
of
champagne
we
are
both
good
fellows
and
we
can
speak
to
each
other
frankly
i
have
not
come
here
suspiciously
beatrix
loves
me
this
with
a
gesture
of
the
utmost
but
the
truth
is
i
have
ceased
to
love
her
i
am
not
here
to
carry
her
away
with
me
but
to
break
off
our
relations
and
to
leave
her
the
honors
of
the
rupture
you
are
young
you
don
t
yet
know
how
useful
it
is
to
appear
to
be
the
victim
when
you
are
really
the
executioner
young
men
spit
fire
and
flame
they
leave
a
woman
with
noise
and
fury
they
often
despise
her
and
they
make
her
hate
them
but
wise
men
do
as
i
am
doing
they
get
themselves
dismissed
assuming
a
mortified
air
which
leaves
regret
in
the
woman
s
heart
and
also
a
sense
of
her
superiority
you
don
t
yet
know
luckily
for
you
how
hampered
men
often
are
in
their
careers
by
the
rash
promises
which
women
are
silly
enough
to
accept
when
gallantry
obliges
us
to
make
nooses
to
catch
our
happiness
we
swear
eternal
faithfulness
and
declare
that
we
desire
to
pass
our
lives
with
them
and
seem
to
await
a
husband
s
death
impatiently
let
him
die
and
there
are
some
provincial
women
obtuse
or
silly
or
malicious
enough
to
say
here
am
i
free
at
the
spent
ball
suddenly
comes
to
life
again
and
falls
plumb
in
the
midst
of
our
finest
triumphs
or
our
most
carefully
planned
happiness
i
have
seen
that
you
love
beatrix
i
leave
her
therefore
in
a
position
where
she
loses
nothing
of
her
precious
majesty
she
will
certainly
coquet
with
you
if
only
to
tease
and
annoy
that
angel
of
a
camille
maupin
well
my
dear
fellow
take
her
love
her
you
ll
do
me
a
great
service
i
want
her
to
turn
against
me
i
have
been
afraid
of
her
pride
and
her
virtue
perhaps
in
spite
of
my
approval
of
the
matter
it
may
take
some
time
to
effect
this
on
such
occasions
the
wisest
plan
is
to
take
no
step
at
all
i
did
just
now
as
we
walked
about
the
lawn
attempt
to
let
her
see
that
i
knew
all
and
was
ready
to
congratulate
her
on
her
new
happiness
well
she
was
furious
at
this
moment
i
am
desperately
in
love
with
the
youngest
and
handsomest
of
our
mademoiselle
falcon
of
the
grand
opera
i
think
of
marrying
her
yes
i
have
got
as
far
as
that
when
you
come
to
paris
you
will
see
that
i
have
changed
a
marquise
for
a
calyste
whose
candid
face
revealed
his
satisfaction
admitted
his
love
for
beatrix
which
was
all
that
conti
wanted
to
discover
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
however
or
depraved
he
may
be
whose
love
will
not
flame
up
again
the
moment
he
sees
it
threatened
by
a
rival
he
may
wish
to
leave
a
woman
but
he
will
never
willingly
let
her
leave
him
when
a
pair
of
lovers
get
to
this
extremity
both
the
man
and
the
woman
strive
for
priority
of
action
so
deep
is
the
wound
to
their
vanity
questioned
by
the
composer
calyste
related
all
that
had
happened
during
the
last
three
weeks
at
les
touches
delighted
to
find
that
conti
who
concealed
his
fury
under
an
appearance
of
charming
took
it
all
in
good
part
come
let
us
go
upstairs
said
the
latter
women
are
so
distrustful
those
two
will
wonder
how
we
can
sit
here
together
without
tearing
each
other
s
hair
out
they
are
even
capable
of
coming
down
to
listen
i
ll
serve
you
faithfully
my
dear
boy
you
ll
see
me
rough
and
jealous
with
the
marquise
i
shall
seem
to
suspect
her
there
s
no
better
way
to
drive
a
woman
to
betray
you
you
will
be
happy
and
i
shall
be
free
seem
to
pity
that
angel
for
belonging
to
a
man
without
delicacy
show
her
a
tear
for
you
can
weep
you
are
still
young
i
alas
can
weep
no
more
and
that
s
a
great
advantage
calyste
and
conti
went
up
to
camille
s
salon
the
composer
begged
by
his
young
rival
to
sing
gave
them
that
greatest
of
musical
masterpieces
viewed
as
execution
the
famous
che
spunti
l
which
rubini
himself
never
attempted
without
trembling
and
which
had
often
been
conti
s
triumph
never
was
his
singing
more
extraordinary
than
on
this
occasion
when
so
many
feelings
were
contending
in
his
breast
calyste
was
in
ecstasy
as
conti
sang
the
first
words
of
the
cavatina
he
looked
intently
at
the
marquise
giving
to
those
words
a
cruel
signification
which
was
fully
understood
camille
who
accompanied
him
guessed
the
order
thus
conveyed
which
bowed
the
head
of
the
luckless
beatrix
she
looked
at
calyste
and
felt
sure
that
the
youth
had
fallen
into
some
trap
in
spite
of
her
advice
this
conviction
became
certainty
when
the
evidently
happy
breton
came
up
to
bid
beatrix
kissing
her
hand
and
pressing
it
with
a
little
air
of
happy
confidence
by
the
time
calyste
had
reached
guerande
the
servants
were
packing
conti
s
and
by
dawn
as
the
song
had
said
the
composer
was
carrying
beatrix
away
with
camille
s
horses
to
the
first
relay
the
morning
twilight
enabled
madame
de
rochefide
to
see
guerande
its
towers
whitened
by
the
dawn
shining
out
upon
the
still
dark
sky
melancholy
thoughts
possessed
her
she
was
leaving
there
one
of
the
sweetest
flowers
of
all
her
life
a
pure
love
such
as
a
young
girl
dreams
of
the
only
true
love
she
had
ever
known
or
was
ever
to
conceive
of
the
woman
of
the
world
obeyed
the
laws
of
the
world
she
sacrificed
love
to
their
demands
just
as
many
women
sacrifice
it
to
religion
or
to
duty
sometimes
mere
pride
can
rise
in
acts
as
high
as
virtue
read
thus
this
history
is
that
of
many
women
the
next
morning
calyste
went
to
les
touches
about
when
he
reached
the
spot
from
which
the
day
before
he
had
seen
beatrix
watching
for
him
at
the
window
he
saw
camille
who
instantly
ran
down
to
him
she
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
told
the
cruel
truth
in
one
word
gone
beatrix
asked
calyste
thunderstruck
you
have
been
duped
by
conti
you
told
me
nothing
and
i
could
do
nothing
for
she
led
the
poor
fellow
to
her
little
salon
where
he
flung
himself
on
the
divan
where
he
had
so
often
seen
the
marquise
and
burst
into
tears
felicite
smoked
her
hookah
and
said
nothing
knowing
well
that
no
words
or
thoughts
are
capable
of
arresting
the
first
anguish
of
such
pain
which
is
always
deaf
and
dumb
calyste
unable
even
to
think
much
less
to
choose
a
course
sat
there
all
day
in
a
state
of
complete
torpidity
just
before
dinner
was
served
camille
tried
to
say
a
few
words
after
begging
him
very
earnestly
to
listen
to
her
friend
she
said
you
caused
me
the
bitterest
suffering
and
i
had
not
like
you
a
beautiful
young
life
before
me
in
which
to
heal
myself
for
me
life
has
no
longer
any
spring
nor
my
soul
a
love
so
to
find
consolation
i
have
had
to
look
above
here
in
this
room
the
day
before
beatrix
came
here
i
drew
you
her
portrait
i
did
not
do
her
injustice
or
you
might
have
thought
me
jealous
i
wanted
you
to
know
her
as
she
is
for
that
would
have
kept
you
safe
listen
now
to
the
full
truth
madame
de
rochefide
is
wholly
unworthy
of
you
the
scandal
of
her
fall
was
not
necessary
she
did
the
thing
deliberately
in
order
to
play
a
part
in
the
eyes
of
society
she
is
one
of
those
women
who
prefer
the
celebrity
of
a
scandal
to
tranquil
happiness
they
fly
in
the
face
of
society
to
obtain
the
fatal
alms
of
a
rebuke
they
desire
to
be
talked
about
at
any
cost
beatrix
was
eaten
up
with
vanity
her
fortune
and
her
wit
had
not
given
her
the
feminine
royalty
that
she
craved
they
had
not
enabled
her
to
reign
supreme
over
a
salon
she
then
bethought
herself
of
seeking
the
celebrity
of
the
duchesse
de
langeais
and
the
vicomtesse
de
beauseant
but
the
world
after
all
is
just
it
gives
the
homage
of
its
interest
to
real
feelings
only
beatrix
playing
comedy
was
judged
to
be
a
actress
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
her
flight
the
sword
of
damocles
was
not
suspended
over
her
head
she
is
neither
sincere
nor
loving
nor
tender
if
she
were
would
she
have
gone
away
with
conti
this
morning
camille
talked
long
and
eloquently
but
this
last
effort
to
open
calyste
s
eyes
was
useless
and
she
said
no
more
when
he
expressed
to
her
by
a
gesture
his
absolute
belief
in
beatrix
she
forced
him
to
come
down
into
the
and
sit
there
while
she
dined
though
he
himself
was
unable
to
swallow
food
it
is
only
during
extreme
youth
that
these
contractions
of
the
bodily
functions
occur
later
the
organs
have
acquired
as
it
were
fixed
habits
and
are
hardened
the
reaction
of
the
mental
and
moral
system
upon
the
physical
is
not
enough
to
produce
a
mortal
illness
unless
the
physical
system
retains
its
primitive
purity
a
man
resists
the
violent
grief
that
kills
a
youth
less
by
the
greater
weakness
of
his
affection
than
by
the
greater
strength
of
his
organs
therefore
mademoiselle
des
touches
was
greatly
alarmed
by
the
calm
resigned
attitude
which
calyste
took
after
his
burst
of
tears
had
subsided
before
he
left
her
he
asked
permission
to
go
into
beatrix
s
bedroom
where
he
had
seen
her
on
the
night
of
her
illness
and
there
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
where
hers
had
lain
i
am
committing
follies
he
said
grasping
camille
s
hand
and
bidding
her
in
deep
dejection
he
returned
home
found
the
usual
company
at
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
evening
sitting
beside
his
mother
the
rector
the
chevalier
du
halga
and
mademoiselle
de
all
knew
of
madame
de
rochefide
s
departure
and
were
rejoicing
in
it
calyste
would
now
return
to
them
and
all
three
watched
him
cautiously
no
one
in
that
old
was
capable
of
imagining
the
result
of
a
first
love
the
love
of
youth
in
a
heart
so
simple
and
so
true
as
that
of
calyste
xvi
sickness
unto
death
for
several
days
calyste
went
regularly
to
les
touches
he
paced
round
and
round
the
lawn
where
he
had
sometimes
walked
with
beatrix
on
his
arm
he
often
went
to
croisic
to
stand
upon
that
fateful
rock
or
lie
for
hours
in
the
bush
of
box
for
by
studying
the
footholds
on
the
sides
of
the
fissure
he
had
found
a
means
of
getting
up
and
down
these
solitary
trips
his
silence
his
gravity
made
his
mother
very
anxious
after
about
two
weeks
during
which
time
this
conduct
like
that
of
a
caged
animal
lasted
this
poor
lover
caged
in
his
despair
ceased
to
cross
the
bay
he
had
scarcely
strength
to
drag
himself
along
the
road
from
guerande
to
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
beatrix
watching
from
her
window
the
family
delighted
at
the
departure
of
those
parisians
to
use
a
term
of
the
provinces
saw
nothing
fatal
or
diseased
about
the
lad
the
two
old
maids
and
the
rector
pursuing
their
scheme
had
kept
charlotte
de
kergarouet
who
nightly
played
off
her
little
coquetries
on
calyste
obtaining
in
return
nothing
better
than
advice
in
playing
during
these
long
evenings
calyste
sat
between
his
mother
and
the
little
breton
girl
observed
by
the
rector
and
charlotte
s
aunt
who
discussed
his
greater
or
less
depression
as
they
walked
home
together
their
simple
minds
mistook
the
lethargic
indifference
of
the
hapless
youth
for
submission
to
their
plans
one
evening
when
calyste
wearied
out
went
off
suddenly
to
bed
the
players
dropped
their
cards
upon
the
table
and
looked
at
each
other
as
the
young
man
closed
the
door
of
his
chamber
one
and
all
had
listened
to
the
sound
of
his
receding
steps
with
anxiety
something
is
the
matter
with
calyste
said
the
baroness
wiping
her
eyes
nothing
is
the
matter
replied
mademoiselle
de
but
you
should
marry
him
at
do
you
believe
that
marriage
would
divert
his
mind
asked
the
chevalier
charlotte
looked
reprovingly
at
monsieur
du
halga
whom
she
now
began
to
think
depraved
immoral
without
religion
and
very
ridiculous
about
his
dog
opinions
which
her
aunt
defending
the
old
sailor
combated
i
shall
lecture
calyste
morning
said
the
baron
whom
the
others
had
thought
asleep
i
do
not
wish
to
go
out
of
this
world
without
seeing
my
grandson
a
little
pink
and
white
guenic
with
a
breton
cap
on
his
calyste
doesn
t
say
a
word
said
old
zephirine
and
there
s
no
making
out
what
s
the
matter
with
him
he
doesn
t
eat
i
don
t
see
what
he
lives
on
if
he
gets
his
meals
at
les
touches
the
devil
s
kitchen
doesn
t
nourish
he
is
in
love
said
the
chevalier
risking
that
opinion
very
timidly
come
come
old
you
ve
forgotten
to
put
in
your
stake
cried
mademoiselle
de
when
you
begin
to
think
of
your
young
days
you
forget
come
to
breakfast
said
old
zephirine
to
her
friend
jacqueline
my
brother
will
have
had
a
talk
with
his
son
and
we
can
settle
the
matter
finally
one
nail
you
know
drives
out
not
among
bretons
said
the
chevalier
the
next
day
calyste
saw
charlotte
as
she
arrived
dressed
with
unusual
care
just
after
the
baron
had
given
him
in
the
a
discourse
on
matrimony
to
which
he
could
make
no
answer
he
now
knew
the
ignorance
of
his
father
and
mother
and
all
their
friends
he
had
gathered
the
fruits
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
knew
himself
to
be
as
much
isolated
as
if
he
did
not
speak
the
family
language
he
merely
requested
his
father
to
give
him
a
few
days
grace
the
old
baron
rubbed
his
hands
with
joy
and
gave
fresh
life
to
the
baroness
by
whispering
in
her
ear
what
he
called
the
good
news
breakfast
was
gay
charlotte
to
whom
the
baron
had
given
a
hint
was
sparkling
after
the
meal
was
over
calyste
went
out
upon
the
portico
leading
to
the
garden
followed
by
charlotte
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
led
her
to
the
grotto
their
parents
and
friends
were
at
the
window
looking
at
them
with
a
species
of
tenderness
presently
charlotte
uneasy
at
her
suitor
s
silence
looked
back
and
saw
them
which
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
beginning
the
conversation
by
saying
to
calyste
they
are
watching
they
can
not
hear
us
he
replied
true
but
they
see
let
us
sit
down
charlotte
replied
calyste
gently
taking
her
hand
is
it
true
that
your
banner
used
formerly
to
float
from
that
twisted
column
asked
charlotte
with
a
sense
that
the
house
was
already
hers
how
comfortable
she
should
be
there
what
a
happy
sort
of
life
you
will
make
some
changes
inside
the
house
won
t
you
calyste
she
said
i
shall
not
have
time
my
dear
charlotte
said
the
young
man
taking
her
hands
and
kissing
them
i
am
going
now
to
tell
you
my
secret
i
love
too
well
a
person
whom
you
have
seen
and
who
loves
me
to
be
able
to
make
the
happiness
of
any
other
woman
though
i
know
that
from
our
childhood
you
and
i
have
been
destined
for
each
other
by
our
but
she
is
married
i
shall
wait
replied
the
young
man
and
i
too
said
charlotte
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
you
can
not
long
love
a
woman
like
that
who
they
say
has
gone
off
with
a
singer
marry
my
dear
charlotte
said
calyste
interrupting
her
with
the
fortune
your
aunt
intends
to
give
you
which
is
enormous
for
brittany
you
can
choose
some
better
man
than
i
you
could
marry
a
titled
man
i
have
brought
you
here
not
to
tell
you
what
you
already
knew
but
to
entreat
you
in
the
name
of
our
childish
friendship
to
take
this
rupture
upon
yourself
and
say
that
you
have
rejected
me
say
that
you
do
not
wish
to
marry
a
man
whose
heart
is
not
free
and
thus
i
shall
be
spared
at
least
the
sense
that
i
have
done
you
public
wrong
you
do
not
know
charlotte
how
heavy
a
burden
life
now
is
to
me
i
can
not
bear
the
slightest
struggle
i
am
weakened
like
a
man
whose
vital
spark
is
gone
whose
soul
has
left
him
if
it
were
not
for
the
grief
i
should
cause
my
mother
i
would
have
flung
myself
before
now
into
the
sea
i
have
not
returned
to
the
rocks
at
croisic
since
the
day
that
temptation
became
almost
irresistible
do
not
speak
of
this
to
any
one
he
took
the
young
girl
s
head
and
kissed
her
hair
then
he
left
the
garden
by
the
and
fled
to
les
touches
where
he
stayed
near
camille
till
past
midnight
on
returning
home
at
one
in
the
morning
he
found
his
mother
awaiting
him
with
her
he
entered
softly
clasped
her
hand
in
his
and
said
is
charlotte
gone
she
goes
with
her
aunt
in
despair
both
of
them
answered
the
baroness
come
to
ireland
with
me
my
many
a
time
i
have
thought
of
flying
there
ah
cried
the
baroness
with
beatrix
he
added
some
days
after
charlotte
s
departure
calyste
joined
the
chevalier
du
halga
in
his
daily
promenade
on
the
mall
with
his
little
dog
they
sat
down
in
the
sunshine
on
a
bench
where
the
young
man
s
eyes
could
wander
from
the
vanes
of
les
touches
to
the
rocks
of
croisic
against
which
the
waves
were
playing
and
dashing
their
white
foam
calyste
was
thin
and
pale
his
strength
was
diminishing
and
he
was
conscious
at
times
of
little
shudders
at
regular
intervals
denoting
fever
his
eyes
surrounded
by
dark
circles
had
that
singular
brilliancy
which
a
fixed
idea
gives
to
the
eyes
of
hermits
and
solitary
souls
or
the
ardor
of
contest
to
those
of
the
strong
fighters
of
our
present
civilization
the
chevalier
was
the
only
person
with
whom
he
could
exchange
a
few
ideas
he
had
divined
in
that
old
man
an
apostle
of
his
own
religion
he
recognized
in
his
soul
the
vestiges
of
an
eternal
love
have
you
loved
many
women
in
your
life
he
asked
him
on
the
second
occasion
when
as
seamen
say
they
sailed
in
company
along
the
mall
only
one
replied
du
halga
was
she
free
no
exclaimed
the
chevalier
ah
how
i
suffered
she
was
the
wife
of
my
best
friend
my
protector
my
chief
but
we
loved
each
other
so
did
she
love
you
said
calyste
passionately
replied
the
chevalier
with
a
fervency
not
usual
with
him
you
were
happy
until
her
death
she
died
at
the
age
of
during
the
emigration
at
petersburg
the
climate
of
which
killed
her
she
must
be
very
cold
in
her
coffin
i
have
often
thought
of
going
there
to
fetch
her
and
lay
her
in
our
dear
brittany
near
to
me
but
she
lies
in
my
the
chevalier
brushed
away
his
tears
calyste
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
i
care
for
this
little
dog
more
than
for
life
itself
said
the
old
man
pointing
to
thisbe
the
little
darling
is
precisely
like
the
one
she
held
on
her
knees
and
stroked
with
her
beautiful
hands
i
never
look
at
thisbe
but
what
i
see
the
hands
of
madame
l
did
you
see
madame
de
rochefide
asked
calyste
no
replied
the
chevalier
it
is
years
since
i
have
looked
at
any
woman
with
attention
except
your
mother
who
has
something
of
madame
l
amirale
s
three
days
later
the
chevalier
said
to
calyste
on
the
mall
my
child
i
have
a
hundred
and
forty
laid
by
when
you
know
where
madame
de
rochefide
is
come
and
get
them
and
follow
calyste
thanked
the
old
man
whose
existence
he
envied
but
now
from
day
to
day
he
grew
morose
he
seemed
to
love
no
one
all
things
hurt
him
he
was
gentle
and
kind
to
his
mother
only
the
baroness
watched
with
ever
increasing
anxiety
the
progress
of
his
madness
she
alone
was
able
by
force
of
prayer
and
entreaty
to
make
him
swallow
food
toward
the
end
of
october
the
sick
lad
ceased
to
go
even
to
the
mall
in
search
of
the
chevalier
who
now
came
vainly
to
the
house
to
tempt
him
out
with
the
coaxing
wisdom
of
an
old
man
we
can
talk
of
madame
de
rochefide
he
would
say
i
ll
tell
you
my
first
your
son
is
ill
he
said
privately
to
the
baroness
on
the
day
he
became
convinced
that
all
such
efforts
were
useless
calyste
replied
to
questions
about
his
health
that
he
was
perfectly
well
but
like
all
young
victims
of
melancholy
he
took
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
death
he
no
longer
left
the
house
but
sat
in
the
garden
on
a
bench
warming
himself
in
the
pale
and
tepid
sunshine
alone
with
his
one
thought
and
avoiding
all
companionship
soon
after
the
day
when
calyste
ceased
to
go
even
to
les
touches
felicite
requested
the
rector
of
guerande
to
come
and
see
her
the
assiduity
with
which
the
abbe
grimont
called
every
morning
at
les
touches
and
sometimes
dined
there
became
the
great
topic
of
the
town
it
was
talked
of
all
over
the
region
and
even
reached
nantes
nevertheless
the
rector
never
missed
a
single
evening
at
the
hotel
du
guenic
where
desolation
reigned
masters
and
servants
were
all
afflicted
at
calyste
s
increasing
weakness
though
none
of
them
thought
him
in
danger
how
could
it
ever
enter
the
minds
of
these
good
people
that
youth
might
die
of
love
even
the
chevalier
had
no
example
of
such
a
death
among
his
memories
of
life
and
travel
they
attributed
calyste
s
thinness
to
want
of
food
his
mother
implored
him
to
eat
calyste
endeavored
to
conquer
his
repugnance
in
order
to
comfort
her
but
nourishment
taken
against
his
will
served
only
to
increase
the
slow
fever
which
was
now
consuming
the
beautiful
young
life
during
the
last
days
of
october
the
cherished
child
of
the
house
could
no
longer
mount
the
stairs
to
his
chamber
and
his
bed
was
placed
in
the
lower
hall
where
he
was
surrounded
at
all
hours
by
his
family
they
sent
at
last
for
the
guerande
physician
who
broke
the
fever
with
quinine
and
reduced
it
in
a
few
days
ordering
calyste
to
take
exercise
and
find
something
to
amuse
him
the
baron
on
this
came
out
of
his
apathy
and
recovered
a
little
of
his
old
strength
he
grew
younger
as
his
son
seemed
to
age
with
calyste
gasselin
and
his
two
fine
dogs
he
started
for
the
forest
and
for
some
days
all
three
hunted
calyste
obeyed
his
father
and
went
where
he
was
told
from
forest
to
forest
visiting
friends
and
acquaintances
in
the
neighboring
chateaus
but
the
youth
had
no
spirit
or
gaiety
nothing
brought
a
smile
to
his
face
his
livid
and
contracted
features
betrayed
an
utterly
passive
being
the
baron
worn
out
at
last
by
fatigue
consequent
on
this
spasm
of
exertion
was
forced
to
return
home
bringing
calyste
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
almost
equal
to
his
own
for
several
days
after
their
return
both
father
and
son
were
so
dangerously
ill
that
the
family
were
forced
to
send
at
the
request
of
the
guerande
physician
himself
for
two
of
the
best
doctors
in
nantes
the
baron
had
received
a
fatal
shock
on
realizing
the
change
now
so
visible
in
calyste
with
that
lucidity
of
mind
which
nature
gives
to
the
dying
he
trembled
at
the
thought
that
his
race
was
about
to
perish
he
said
no
word
but
he
clasped
his
hands
and
prayed
to
god
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
from
which
his
weakness
now
prevented
him
from
rising
the
father
s
face
was
turned
toward
the
bed
where
the
son
lay
and
he
looked
at
him
almost
incessantly
at
the
least
motion
calyste
made
a
singular
commotion
stirred
within
him
as
if
the
flame
of
his
own
life
were
flickering
the
baroness
no
longer
left
the
room
where
zephirine
sat
knitting
in
the
in
horrible
uneasiness
demands
were
made
upon
the
old
woman
for
wood
father
and
son
both
suffering
from
the
cold
and
for
supplies
and
provisions
so
that
finally
not
being
agile
enough
to
supply
these
wants
she
had
given
her
precious
keys
to
mariotte
but
she
insisted
on
knowing
everything
she
questioned
mariotte
and
her
incessantly
asking
in
a
low
voice
to
be
told
over
and
over
again
the
state
of
her
brother
and
nephew
one
night
when
father
and
son
were
dozing
mademoiselle
de
told
her
that
she
must
resign
herself
to
the
death
of
her
brother
whose
pallid
face
was
now
the
color
of
wax
the
old
woman
dropped
her
knitting
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
a
while
and
at
length
drew
out
an
old
chaplet
of
black
wood
on
which
she
began
to
pray
with
a
fervor
which
gave
to
her
old
and
withered
face
a
splendor
so
vigorous
that
the
other
old
woman
imitated
her
friend
and
then
all
present
on
a
sign
from
the
rector
joining
in
the
spiritual
uplifting
of
mademoiselle
de
guenic
alas
i
prayed
to
god
said
the
baroness
remembering
her
prayer
after
reading
the
fatal
letter
written
by
calyste
and
he
did
not
hear
perhaps
it
would
be
well
said
the
rector
if
we
begged
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
come
and
see
she
cried
old
zephirine
the
author
of
all
our
misery
she
who
has
turned
him
from
his
family
who
has
taken
him
from
us
led
him
to
read
impious
books
taught
him
an
heretical
language
let
her
be
accursed
and
may
god
never
pardon
her
she
has
destroyed
the
du
guenics
she
may
perhaps
restore
them
said
the
rector
in
a
gentle
voice
mademoiselle
des
touches
is
a
saintly
woman
i
am
her
surety
for
that
she
has
none
but
good
intentions
to
calyste
may
she
only
be
enabled
to
carry
them
let
me
know
the
day
when
she
sets
foot
in
this
house
that
i
may
get
out
of
it
cried
the
old
woman
passionately
she
has
killed
both
father
and
son
do
you
think
i
don
t
hear
death
in
calyste
s
voice
he
is
so
feeble
now
that
he
has
barely
strength
to
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
three
doctors
arrived
they
plied
calyste
with
questions
but
as
for
his
father
the
examination
was
short
they
were
surprised
that
he
still
lived
on
the
guerande
doctor
calmly
told
the
baroness
that
as
to
calyste
it
would
probably
be
best
to
take
him
to
paris
and
consult
the
most
experienced
physicians
for
it
would
cost
over
a
hundred
to
bring
one
down
people
die
of
something
but
not
of
love
said
mademoiselle
de
alas
whatever
be
the
cause
calyste
is
dying
said
the
baroness
i
see
all
the
symptoms
of
consumption
that
most
horrible
disease
of
my
country
about
calyste
dying
said
the
baron
opening
his
eyes
from
which
rolled
two
large
tears
which
slowly
made
their
way
delayed
by
wrinkles
along
his
cheeks
the
only
tears
he
had
probably
ever
shed
in
his
life
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
walked
the
few
steps
to
his
son
s
bedside
took
his
hand
and
looked
earnestly
at
him
what
is
it
you
want
father
said
calyste
that
you
should
live
cried
the
baron
i
can
not
live
without
beatrix
replied
calyste
the
old
man
dropped
into
a
chair
oh
where
could
we
get
a
hundred
to
bring
doctors
from
paris
there
is
still
time
cried
the
baroness
a
hundred
cried
zephirine
will
that
save
him
without
waiting
for
her
s
reply
the
old
maid
ran
her
hands
through
the
of
her
gown
unfastened
the
petticoat
beneath
it
which
gave
forth
a
heavy
sound
as
it
dropped
to
the
floor
she
knew
so
well
the
places
where
she
had
sewn
in
her
that
she
now
ripped
them
out
with
the
rapidity
of
magic
the
gold
pieces
rang
as
they
fell
one
by
one
into
her
lap
the
old
gazed
at
this
performance
in
stupefied
amazement
but
they
ll
see
you
she
whispered
in
her
friend
s
ear
answered
zephirine
continuing
to
count
every
one
will
know
how
much
you
double
all
new
how
did
you
get
them
you
who
can
t
see
clearly
i
felt
them
here
s
one
hundred
and
four
cried
zephirine
is
that
enough
what
is
all
this
asked
the
chevalier
du
halga
who
now
came
in
unable
to
understand
the
attitude
of
his
old
blind
friend
holding
out
her
petticoat
which
was
full
of
gold
coins
mademoiselle
de
explained
i
knew
it
said
the
chevalier
and
i
have
come
to
bring
a
hundred
and
forty
which
i
have
been
holding
at
calyste
s
disposition
as
he
knows
very
the
chevalier
drew
the
from
his
pocket
and
showed
them
mariotte
seeing
such
wealth
sent
gasselin
to
lock
the
doors
gold
will
not
give
him
health
said
the
baroness
weeping
but
it
can
take
him
to
paris
where
he
can
find
her
come
yes
cried
calyste
springing
up
i
will
he
will
live
said
the
baron
in
a
shaking
voice
and
i
can
die
send
for
the
rector
the
words
cast
terror
on
all
present
calyste
seeing
the
mortal
paleness
on
his
father
s
face
for
the
old
man
was
exhausted
by
the
cruel
emotions
of
the
scene
came
to
his
father
s
side
the
rector
after
hearing
the
report
of
the
doctors
had
gone
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
intending
to
bring
her
back
with
him
to
calyste
for
in
proportion
as
the
worthy
man
had
formerly
detested
her
he
now
admired
her
and
protected
her
as
a
shepherd
protects
the
most
precious
of
his
flock
when
the
news
of
the
baron
s
approaching
end
became
known
in
guerande
a
crowd
gathered
in
the
street
and
lane
the
peasants
the
and
the
servants
knelt
in
the
while
the
rector
administered
the
last
sacraments
to
the
old
breton
warrior
the
whole
town
was
agitated
by
the
news
that
the
father
was
dying
beside
his
son
the
probable
extinction
of
this
old
breton
race
was
felt
to
be
a
public
calamity
the
solemn
ceremony
affected
calyste
deeply
his
filial
sorrow
silenced
for
a
moment
the
anguish
of
his
love
during
the
last
hour
of
the
glorious
old
defender
of
the
monarchy
he
knelt
beside
him
watching
the
coming
on
of
death
the
old
man
died
in
his
chair
in
presence
of
the
assembled
family
i
die
faithful
to
god
and
his
religion
he
said
my
god
as
the
reward
of
my
efforts
grant
that
calyste
may
live
i
shall
live
father
and
i
will
obey
you
said
the
young
man
if
you
wish
to
make
my
death
as
happy
as
fanny
has
made
my
life
swear
to
me
to
i
promise
it
it
was
a
touching
sight
to
see
calyste
or
rather
his
shadow
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
old
chevalier
du
halga
a
spectre
leading
a
shade
and
following
the
baron
s
coffin
as
chief
mourner
the
church
and
the
little
square
were
crowded
with
the
country
people
coming
in
to
the
funeral
from
a
circuit
of
thirty
miles
but
the
baroness
and
zephirine
soon
saw
that
in
spite
of
his
intention
to
obey
his
father
s
wishes
calyste
was
falling
back
into
a
condition
of
fatal
stupor
on
the
day
when
the
family
put
on
their
mourning
the
baroness
took
her
son
to
a
bench
in
the
garden
and
questioned
him
closely
calyste
answered
gently
and
submissively
but
his
answers
only
proved
to
her
the
despair
of
his
soul
mother
he
said
there
is
no
life
in
me
what
i
eat
does
not
feed
me
the
air
that
enters
my
lungs
does
not
refresh
me
the
sun
feels
cold
it
seems
to
you
to
light
that
front
of
the
house
and
show
you
the
old
carvings
bathed
in
its
beams
but
to
me
it
is
all
a
blur
a
mist
if
beatrix
were
here
it
would
be
dazzling
there
is
but
one
only
thing
left
in
this
world
that
keeps
its
shape
and
color
to
my
eyes
this
flower
this
foliage
he
added
drawing
from
his
breast
the
withered
bunch
the
marquise
had
given
him
at
croisic
the
baroness
dared
not
say
more
her
son
s
answer
seemed
to
her
more
indicative
of
madness
than
his
silence
of
grief
she
saw
no
hope
no
light
in
the
darkness
that
surrounded
them
the
baron
s
last
hours
and
death
had
prevented
the
rector
from
bringing
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
calyste
as
he
seemed
bent
on
doing
for
reasons
which
he
did
not
reveal
but
on
this
day
while
mother
and
son
still
sat
on
the
garden
bench
calyste
quivered
all
over
on
perceiving
felicite
through
the
opposite
windows
of
the
and
garden
she
reminded
him
of
beatrix
and
his
life
revived
it
was
therefore
to
camille
that
the
poor
stricken
mother
owed
the
first
motion
of
joy
that
lightened
her
mourning
well
calyste
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
when
they
met
i
want
you
to
go
to
paris
with
me
we
will
find
beatrix
she
added
in
a
low
voice
the
pale
thin
face
of
the
youth
flushed
red
and
a
smile
brightened
his
features
let
us
go
he
said
we
shall
save
him
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
the
mother
who
pressed
her
hands
and
wept
for
joy
a
week
after
the
baron
s
funeral
mademoiselle
des
touches
the
baronne
du
guenic
and
calyste
started
for
paris
leaving
the
household
in
charge
of
old
zephirine
xvii
a
death
a
marriage
felicite
s
tender
love
was
preparing
for
calyste
a
prosperous
future
being
allied
to
the
family
of
grandlieu
the
ducal
branch
of
which
was
ending
in
five
daughters
for
lack
of
a
male
heir
she
had
written
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
describing
calyste
and
giving
his
history
and
also
stating
certain
intentions
of
her
own
which
were
as
follows
she
had
lately
sold
her
house
in
the
rue
du
for
which
a
party
of
speculators
had
given
her
two
millions
five
hundred
thousand
francs
her
man
of
business
had
since
purchased
for
her
a
charming
new
house
in
the
rue
de
bourbon
for
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
one
million
she
intended
to
devote
to
the
recovery
of
the
du
guenic
estates
and
the
rest
of
her
fortune
she
desired
to
settle
upon
sabine
de
grandlieu
felicite
had
long
known
the
plans
of
the
duke
and
duchess
as
to
the
settlement
of
their
five
daughters
the
youngest
was
to
marry
the
vicomte
de
grandlieu
the
heir
to
their
ducal
title
the
second
daughter
desired
to
remain
unmarried
in
memory
of
a
man
she
had
deeply
loved
lucien
de
rubempre
while
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
wish
to
become
a
nun
like
her
eldest
sister
two
of
the
remaining
sisters
were
already
married
and
the
youngest
but
one
the
pretty
sabine
just
twenty
years
old
was
the
only
disposable
daughter
left
it
was
sabine
on
whom
felicite
resolved
to
lay
the
burden
of
curing
calyste
s
passion
for
beatrix
during
the
journey
to
paris
mademoiselle
des
touches
revealed
to
the
baroness
these
arrangements
the
new
house
in
the
rue
de
bourbon
was
being
decorated
and
she
intended
it
for
the
home
of
sabine
and
calyste
if
her
plans
succeeded
the
party
had
been
invited
to
stay
at
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
where
the
baroness
was
received
with
all
the
distinction
due
to
her
rank
as
the
wife
of
a
du
guenic
and
the
daughter
of
a
british
peer
mademoiselle
des
touches
urged
calyste
to
see
paris
while
she
herself
made
the
necessary
inquiries
about
beatrix
who
had
disappeared
from
the
world
and
was
travelling
abroad
and
she
took
care
to
throw
him
into
the
midst
of
diversions
and
amusements
of
all
kinds
the
season
for
balls
and
fetes
was
just
beginning
and
the
duchess
and
her
daughters
did
the
honors
of
paris
to
the
young
breton
who
was
insensibly
diverted
from
his
own
thoughts
by
the
movement
and
life
of
the
great
city
he
found
some
resemblance
of
mind
between
madame
de
rochefide
and
sabine
de
grandlieu
who
was
certainly
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
charming
girls
in
parisian
society
and
this
fancied
likeness
made
him
give
to
her
coquetries
a
willing
attention
which
no
other
woman
could
possibly
have
obtained
from
him
sabine
herself
was
greatly
pleased
with
calyste
and
matters
went
so
well
that
during
the
winter
of
the
young
baron
du
guenic
whose
youth
and
health
had
returned
to
him
listened
without
repugnance
to
his
mother
when
she
reminded
him
of
the
promise
made
to
his
dying
father
and
proposed
to
him
a
marriage
with
sabine
de
grandlieu
still
while
agreeing
to
fulfil
his
promise
he
concealed
within
his
soul
an
indifference
to
all
things
of
which
the
baroness
alone
was
aware
but
which
she
trusted
would
be
conquered
by
the
pleasures
of
a
happy
home
on
the
day
when
the
grandlieu
family
and
the
baroness
accompanied
by
her
relations
who
came
from
england
for
this
occasion
assembled
in
the
grand
salon
of
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
to
sign
the
marriage
contract
and
leopold
hannequin
the
family
notary
explained
the
preliminaries
of
that
contract
before
reading
it
calyste
on
whose
forehead
every
one
present
might
have
noticed
clouds
suddenly
and
curtly
refused
to
accept
the
benefactions
offered
him
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
did
he
still
count
on
felicite
s
devotion
to
recover
beatrix
in
the
midst
of
the
embarrassment
and
stupefaction
of
the
assembled
families
sabine
de
grandlieu
entered
the
room
and
gave
him
a
letter
explaining
that
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
requested
her
to
give
it
to
him
on
this
occasion
calyste
turned
away
from
the
company
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
read
as
follows
camille
maupin
to
calyste
calyste
before
i
enter
my
convent
cell
i
am
permitted
to
cast
a
look
upon
the
world
i
am
now
to
leave
for
a
life
of
prayer
and
solitude
that
look
is
to
you
who
have
been
the
whole
world
to
me
in
these
last
months
my
voice
will
reach
you
if
my
calculations
do
not
miscarry
at
the
moment
of
a
ceremony
i
am
unable
to
take
part
in
on
the
day
when
you
stand
before
the
altar
giving
your
hand
and
name
to
a
young
and
charming
girl
who
can
love
you
openly
before
earth
and
heaven
i
shall
be
before
another
altar
in
a
convent
at
nantes
betrothed
forever
to
him
who
will
neither
fail
nor
betray
me
but
i
do
not
write
to
sadden
you
only
to
entreat
you
not
to
hinder
by
false
delicacy
the
service
i
have
wished
to
do
you
since
we
first
met
do
not
contest
my
rights
so
dearly
bought
if
love
is
suffering
ah
i
have
loved
you
indeed
my
calyste
but
feel
no
remorse
the
only
happiness
i
have
known
in
life
i
owe
to
you
the
pangs
were
caused
by
my
own
self
make
me
compensation
then
for
all
those
pangs
those
sorrows
by
causing
me
an
everlasting
joy
let
the
poor
camille
who
no
longer
still
be
something
in
the
material
comfort
you
enjoy
dear
let
me
be
like
the
fragrance
of
flowers
in
your
life
mingling
myself
with
it
unseen
and
not
importunate
to
you
calyste
i
shall
owe
my
eternal
happiness
will
you
not
accept
a
few
paltry
and
fleeting
benefits
from
me
surely
you
will
not
be
wanting
in
generosity
do
you
not
see
in
this
the
last
message
of
a
renounced
love
calyste
the
world
without
you
had
nothing
more
for
me
you
made
it
the
most
awful
of
solitudes
and
you
have
thus
brought
camille
maupin
the
unbeliever
the
writer
of
books
which
i
am
soon
to
repudiate
solemnly
you
have
cast
her
daring
and
perverted
bound
hand
and
foot
before
god
i
am
what
i
might
have
been
what
i
was
born
to
be
innocent
and
a
child
i
have
washed
my
robes
in
the
tears
of
repentance
i
can
come
before
the
altar
whither
my
guardian
angel
my
beloved
calyste
has
led
me
with
what
tender
comfort
i
give
you
that
name
which
the
step
i
now
take
sanctifies
i
love
you
without
as
a
mother
loves
her
son
as
the
church
loves
her
children
i
can
pray
for
you
and
for
yours
without
one
thought
or
wish
except
for
your
happiness
ah
if
you
only
knew
the
sublime
tranquillity
in
which
i
live
now
that
i
have
risen
in
thought
above
all
petty
earthly
interests
and
how
precious
is
the
thought
of
doing
as
your
noble
motto
says
our
duty
you
would
enter
your
beautiful
new
life
with
unfaltering
step
and
never
a
glance
behind
you
or
about
you
above
all
my
earnest
prayer
to
you
is
that
you
be
faithful
to
yourself
and
to
those
belonging
to
you
dear
society
in
which
you
are
to
live
can
not
exist
without
the
religion
of
duty
and
you
will
terribly
mistake
it
as
i
mistook
it
if
you
allow
yourself
to
yield
to
passion
and
to
fancy
as
i
did
woman
is
the
equal
of
man
only
in
making
her
life
a
continual
offering
as
that
of
man
is
a
perpetual
action
my
life
has
been
on
the
contrary
one
long
egotism
if
may
be
that
god
placed
you
toward
evening
by
the
door
of
my
house
as
a
messenger
from
himself
bearing
my
punishment
and
my
pardon
heed
this
confession
of
a
woman
to
whom
fame
has
been
like
a
pharos
warning
her
of
the
only
true
path
be
wise
be
noble

your
fancy
to
your
duties
as
head
of
your
race
as

the
fallen
standard
of
the
old

to
this
century
of
irreligion
and

of

what
a
gentleman
is
in
all
his
grandeur
and
his
honor
dear
child
of
my
soul
let
me
play
the
part
of
a
mother
to
you
your
own
mother
will
not
be
jealous
of
this
voice
from
a
tomb
these
hands

imploring
blessings

than

part
of
mine
and

a
worthy
use
of
it
it

not
a
gift
it
is
a
trust
i
place
in
your
hands
i
have
thought
more
of
your
children
and
of
your
old
breton
house

of
you

you
the
profits
which
time
has
brought
to
my
property
in
paris
let
us
now
sign
the
contract
said
the
young
baron
returning
to
the
assembled
company
the
abbe
grimont
to
whom
the
honor
of
the
conversion
of
this
celebrated
woman
was
attributed
became
soon
after
of
the
diocese
the
following
week
after
the
marriage
ceremony
which
according
to
the
custom
of
many
families
of
the
faubourg
was
celebrated
at
seven
in
the
morning
at
the
church
of
saint
thomas
d
aquin
calyste
and
sabine
got
into
their
pretty
amid
the
tears
embraces
and
congratulations
of
a
score
of
friends
collected
under
the
awning
of
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
the
congratulations
came
from
the
four
witnesses
and
the
men
present
the
tears
were
in
the
eyes
of
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
and
her
daughter
clotilde
who
both
trembled
under
the
weight
of
the
same
thought
she
is
launched
upon
the
sea
of
life
poor
sabine
at
the
mercy
of
a
man
who
does
not
marry
entirely
of
his
own
free
marriage
is
not
wholly
made
up
of
pleasures
as
fugitive
in
that
relation
as
in
all
others
it
involves
compatibility
of
temper
physical
sympathies
harmonies
of
character
which
make
of
that
social
necessity
an
eternal
problem
marriageable
daughters
as
well
as
mothers
know
the
terms
as
well
as
the
dangers
of
this
lottery
and
that
is
why
women
weep
at
a
wedding
while
men
smile
men
believe
that
they
risk
nothing
while
women
know
or
very
nearly
know
what
they
risk
in
another
carriage
which
preceded
the
married
pair
was
the
baronne
du

to
whom
the
duchess
had
said
at
parting
you
are
a

you
have

had
one

try
to
take
my
place
to
my
dear
on
the
box
of
the
bridal
carriage
sat
a
who
acted
as
courier
and
in
the
rumble
were
two
the
four
postilions
dressed
in
their
finest
uniforms
for
each
carriage
was
drawn
by
four
horses
appeared
with
bouquets
on
their
breasts
and
ribbons
on
their
hats
which
the
duc
de
grandlieu
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
making
them
relinquish
even
by
bribing
them
with
money
the
french
postilion
is
eminently
intelligent
but
he
likes
his
fun
these
fellows
took
their
bribes
and
replaced
their
ribbons
at
the
barrier

remember
your

nothing

you

you

clotilde
leaning
on
the
youngest
sister
athenais
who
was
smiling
to
the
vicomte
de
grandlieu
cast
a
reflecting
look
through
her
tears
at
the
bride
and
followed
the
carriage
with
her
eyes
as
it
disappeared
to
the
clacking
of
four
whips
more
noisy
than
the
shots
of
a
pistol
gallery
in
a
few
minutes
the
gay
convoy
had
reached
the
esplanade
of
the
invalides
the
barrier
of
passy
by
the
quay
of
the
pont
d
iena
and
were
fairly
on
the
to
brittany
is
it
not
a
singular
thing
that
the
artisans
of
switzerland
and
germany
and
the
great
families
of
france
and
england
should
one
and
all
follow
the
custom
of
setting
out
on
a
journey
after
the
marriage
ceremony
the
great
people
shut
themselves
in
a
box
which
rolls
along
the
little
people
gaily
tramp
the
roads
sitting
down
in
the
woods
banqueting
at
the
inns
as
long
as
their
joy
or
rather
their
money
lasts
a
moralist
is
puzzled
to
decide
on
which
side
is
the
finer
sense
of
modesty
that
which
hides
from
the
public
eye
and
inaugurates
the
domestic
hearth
and
bed
in
private
as
to
the
worthy
burghers
of
all
lands
or
that
which
withdraws
from
the
family
and
exhibits
itself
publicly
on
the
and
in
face
of
strangers
one
would
think
that
delicate
souls
might
desire
solitude
and
seek
to
escape
both
the
world
and
their
family
the
love
which
begins
a
marriage
is
a
pearl
a
diamond
a
jewel
cut
by
the
choicest
of
arts
a
treasure
to
bury
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
who
can
relate
a
honeymoon
unless
it
be
the
bride
how
many
women
reading
this
history
will
admit
to
themselves
that
this
period
of
uncertain
duration
is
the
forecast
of
conjugal
life
the
first
three
letters
of
sabine
to
her
mother
will
depict
a
situation
not
surprising
to
some
young
brides
and
to
many
old
women
all
those
who
find
themselves
the
so
to
speak
of
a
husband
s
heart
do
not
as
sabine
did
discover
this
at
once
but
young
girls
of
the
faubourg
if
intelligent
are
women
in
mind
before
marriage
they
have
received
from
their
mothers
and
the
world
they
live
in
the
baptism
of
good
manners
though
women
of
rank
anxious
to
hand
down
their
traditions
do
not
always
see
the
bearing
of
their
own
lessons
when
they
say
to
their
daughters
that
is
a
motion
that
must
not
be
made
never
laugh
at
such
things
no
lady
ever
flings
herself
on
a
sofa
she
sits
down
quietly
pray
give
up
such
detestable
ways
my
dear
that
is
a
thing
which
is
never
done
etc
many
bourgeois
critics
unjustly
deny
the
innocence
and
virtue
of
young
girls
who
like
sabine
are
truly
virgin
at
heart
improved
by
the
training
of
their
minds
by
the
habit
of
noble
bearing
by
natural
good
taste
while
from
the
age
of
sixteen
they
have
learned
how
to
use
their
sabine
was
a
girl
of
this
school
which
was
also
that
of
mademoiselle
de
chaulieu
this
inborn
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
these
gifts
of
race
made
sabine
de
grandlieu
as
interesting
a
young
woman
as
the
heroine
of
the
memoirs
of
two
young
married
her
letters
to
her
mother
during
the
honeymoon
of
which
we
here
give
three
or
four
will
show
the
qualities
of
her
mind
and
temperament
guerande
april
to
madame
la
duchesse
de
grandlieu
dear
mamma
you
will
understand
why
i
did
not
write
to
you
during
the
journey
our
wits
are
then
like
wheels
here
i
am
for
the
last
two
days
in
the
depths
of
brittany
at
the
hotel
du
guenic
a
house
as
covered
with
carving
as
a
box
in
spite
of
the
affectionate
devotion
of
calyste
s
family
i
feel
a
keen
desire
to
fly
to
you
to
tell
you
many
things
which
can
only
be
trusted
to
a
mother
calyste
married
dear
mamma
with
a
great
sorrow
in
his
heart
we
all
knew
that
and
you
did
not
hide
from
me
the
difficulties
of
my
position
but
alas
they
are
greater
than
you
thought
ah
my
dear
mother
what
experience
we
acquire
in
the
short
space
of
a
few
days
i
might
even
say
a
few
hours
all
your
counsels
have
proved
fruitless
you
will
see
why
from
one
sentence
i
love
calyste
as
if
he
were
not
my
husband
that
is
to
say
if
i
were
married
to
another
and
were
travelling
with
calyste
i
should
love
calyste
and
hate
my
husband
now
think
of
a
man
beloved
so
completely
involuntarily
absolutely
and
all
the
other
adverbs
you
may
choose
to
employ
and
you
will
see
that
my
servitude
is
established
in
spite
of
your
good
advice
you
told
me
to
be
grand
noble
dignified
and
in
order
to
obtain
from
calyste
the
feelings
that
are
never
subject
to
the
chances
and
changes
of
life
esteem
honor
and
the
consideration
which
sanctifies
a
woman
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
i
remember
how
you
blamed
i
dare
say
justly
the
young
women
of
the
present
day
who
under
pretext
of
living
happily
with
their
husbands
begin
by
compliance
flattery
familiarity
an
abandonment
you
called
it
a
little
too
wanton
a
word
i
did
not
fully
understand
all
of
which
if
i
must
believe
you
are
relays
that
lead
rapidly
to
indifference
and
possibly
to
contempt
remember
that
you
are
a
grandlieu
yes
i
remember
that
you
told
me
all
that
but
oh
that
advice
filled
with
the
maternal
eloquence
of
a
female
daedelus
has
had
the
fate
of
all
things
mythological
dear
beloved
mother
could
you
ever
have
supposed
it
possible
that
i
should
begin
by
the
catastrophe
which
according
to
you
ends
the
honeymoon
of
the
young
women
of
the
present
day
when
calyste
and
i
were
fairly
alone
in
the
travelling
carriage
we
felt
rather
foolish
in
each
other
s
company
understanding
the
importance
of
the
first
word
the
first
look
and
we
both
bewildered
by
the
solemnity
looked
out
of
our
respective
windows
it
became
so
ridiculous
that
when
we
reached
the
barrier
monsieur
began
in
a
rather
troubled
tone
of
voice
a
set
discourse
prepared
no
doubt
like
other
improvisations
to
which
i
listened
with
a
beating
heart
and
which
i
take
the
liberty
of
here
abridging
my
dear
sabine
he
said
i
want
you
to
be
happy
and
above
all
do
i
wish
you
to
be
happy
in
your
own
way
therefore
in
the
situation
in
which
we
are
instead
of
deceiving
ourselves
mutually
about
our
characters
and
our
feelings
by
noble
compliances
let
us
endeavor
to
be
to
each
other
at
once
what
we
should
be
years
hence
think
always
that
you
have
a
friend
and
a
brother
in
me
as
i
shall
feel
i
have
a
sister
and
a
friend
in
though
it
was
all
said
with
the
utmost
delicacy
i
found
nothing
in
this
first
conjugal
which
responded
to
the
feelings
in
my
soul
and
i
remained
pensive
after
replying
that
i
was
animated
by
the
same
sentiments
after
this
declaration
of
our
rights
to
mutual
coldness
we
talked
of
weather
relays
and
scenery
in
the
most
charming
manner
i
with
rather
a
forced
little
laugh
he
at
last
as
we
were
leaving
versailles
i
turned
to
calyste
whom
i
called
my
dear
calyste
and
he
called
me
my
dear
sabine
and
asked
him
plainly
to
tell
me
the
events
which
had
led
him
to
the
point
of
death
and
to
which
i
was
aware
that
i
owed
the
happiness
of
being
his
wife
he
hesitated
long
in
fact
my
request
gave
rise
to
a
little
argument
between
us
which
lasted
through
three
relays
i
endeavoring
to
maintain
the
part
of
an
obstinate
girl
and
trying
to
sulk
he
debating
within
himself
the
question
which
the
newspapers
used
to
put
to
charles
must
the
king
yield
or
not
at
last
after
passing
verneuil
and
exchanging
oaths
enough
to
satisfy
three
dynasties
never
to
reproach
him
for
his
folly
and
never
to
treat
him
coldly
he
related
to
me
his
love
for
madame
de
rochefide
i
do
not
wish
he
said
in
conclusion
to
have
any
secrets
between
poor
dear
calyste
it
seems
was
ignorant
that
his
friend
mademoiselle
des
touches
and
you
had
thought
it
right
to
tell
me
the
truth
well
mother
for
i
can
tell
all
to
a
mother
as
tender
as
you
i
was
deeply
hurt
by
perceiving
that
he
had
yielded
less
to
my
request
than
to
his
own
desire
to
talk
of
that
strange
passion
do
you
blame
me
darling
mother
for
having
wished
to
reconnoitre
the
extent
of
the
grief
the
open
wound
of
the
heart
of
which
you
warned
me
so
eight
hours
after
receiving
the
rector
s
blessing
at
d
aquin
your
sabine
was
in
the
rather
false
position
of
a
young
wife
listening
to
a
confidence
from
the
very
lips
of
her
husband
of
his
misplaced
love
for
an
unworthy
rival
yes
there
i
was
in
the
drama
of
a
young
woman
learning
officially
as
it
were
that
she
owed
her
marriage
to
the
disdainful
rejection
of
an
old
and
faded
beauty
still
i
gained
what
i
sought
what
was
that
you
will
ask
ah
mother
dear
i
have
seen
too
much
of
love
going
on
around
me
not
to
know
how
to
put
a
little
of
it
into
practice
well
calyste
ended
the
poem
of
his
miseries
with
the
warmest
protestations
of
an
absolute
forgetting
of
what
he
called
his
madness
all
kinds
of
affirmations
have
to
be
signed
you
know
the
happy
unhappy
one
took
my
hand
carried
it
to
his
lips
and
after
that
he
kept
it
for
a
long
time
clasped
in
his
own
a
declaration
followed
seemed
to
me
more
conformable
than
the
first
to
the
demands
of
our
new
condition
though
our
lips
never
said
a
word
perhaps
i
owed
it
to
the
vigorous
indignation
i
felt
and
showed
at
the
bad
taste
of
a
woman
foolish
enough
not
to
love
my
beautiful
my
glorious
calyste
they
are
calling
me
to
play
a
game
of
cards
which
i
do
not
yet
understand
i
will
finish
my
letter
to
leave
you
at
this
moment
to
make
a
fifth
at
that
is
the
name
of
the
game
can
only
be
done
in
the
depths
of
brittany
adieu
your
sabine
guerande
may
i
take
up
my
odyssey
on
the
third
day
your
children
no
longer
used
the
ceremonious
you
they
thee
d
and
thou
d
each
other
like
lovers
my
enchanted
to
see
us
so
happy
is
trying
to
take
your
place
to
me
dear
mother
and
as
often
happens
when
people
play
a
part
to
efface
other
memories
she
has
been
so
charming
that
she
is
you
to
me
i
think
she
has
guessed
the
heroism
of
my
conduct
for
at
the
beginning
of
our
journey
she
tried
to
hide
her
anxiety
with
such
care
that
it
was
visible
from
excessive
precaution
when
i
saw
the
towers
of
guerande
rising
in
the
distance
i
whispered
in
the
ear
of
your
have
you
really
forgotten
her
my
husband
now
become
can
t
know
anything
i
think
about
sincere
and
simple
love
for
the
words
made
him
wild
with
happiness
still
i
think
the
desire
to
put
madame
de
rochefide
forever
out
of
his
mind
led
me
too
far
but
how
could
i
help
it
i
love
and
i
am
half
a
portuguese
for
i
am
much
more
like
you
mamma
than
like
my
father
calyste
accepts
all
from
me
as
spoilt
children
accept
things
they
think
it
their
right
he
is
an
only
child
i
remember
that
but
between
ourselves
i
will
not
give
my
daughter
if
i
have
any
daughters
to
an
only
son
i
see
a
variety
of
tyrants
in
an
only
son
so
mamma
we
have
rather
inverted
our
parts
and
i
am
the
devoted
half
of
the
pair
there
are
dangers
i
know
in
devotion
though
we
profit
by
it
we
lose
our
dignity
for
one
thing
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
of
the
wreck
of
that
dignity
after
all
is
only
a
screen
set
up
before
pride
behind
which
we
rage
as
we
please
but
how
could
i
help
it
you
were
not
here
and
i
saw
a
gulf
opening
before
me
had
i
remained
upon
my
dignity
i
should
have
won
only
the
cold
joys
or
pains
of
a
sort
of
brotherhood
which
would
soon
have
drifted
into
indifference
what
sort
of
future
might
that
have
led
to
my
devotion
has
i
know
made
me
calyste
s
slave
but
shall
i
regret
it
we
shall
see
as
for
the
present
i
am
delighted
with
it
i
love
calyste
i
love
him
absolutely
with
the
folly
of
a
mother
who
thinks
that
all
her
son
may
do
is
right
even
if
he
tyrannizes
a
trifle
over
her
guerande
may
up
to
the
present
moment
dear
mamma
i
find
marriage
a
delightful
affair
i
can
spend
all
my
tenderness
on
the
noblest
of
men
whom
a
foolish
woman
disdained
for
a
fiddler
for
that
woman
evidently
was
a
fool
and
a
cold
fool
the
worst
kind
i
in
my
legitimate
love
am
charitable
i
am
curing
his
wounds
while
i
lay
my
heart
open
to
incurable
ones
yes
the
more
i
love
calyste
the
more
i
feel
that
i
should
die
of
grief
if
our
present
happiness
ever
ceased
i
must
tell
you
how
the
whole
family
and
the
circle
which
meets
at
the
hotel
de
guenic
adore
me
they
are
all
personages
born
under
tapestries
of
the
highest
warp
in
fact
they
seem
to
have
stepped
from
those
old
tapestries
as
if
to
prove
that
the
impossible
may
exist
some
day
when
we
are
alone
together
i
will
describe
to
you
my
aunt
zephirine
mademoiselle
de
the
chevalier
du
halga
the
demoiselles
de
kergarouet
and
others
they
all
even
to
the
two
servants
gasselin
and
mariotte
whom
i
wish
they
would
let
me
take
to
paris
regard
me
as
an
angel
sent
from
heaven
they
tremble
when
i
speak
dear
people
they
ought
to
be
preserved
under
glass
my
has
solemnly
installed
us
in
the
apartments
formerly
occupied
by
herself
and
her
late
husband
the
scene
was
touching
she
said
to
us
i
spent
my
whole
married
life
a
happy
woman
in
these
rooms
may
the
omen
be
a
happy
one
for
you
my
she
has
taken
calyste
s
former
room
for
hers
saintly
soul
she
seems
intent
on
laying
off
her
memories
and
all
her
conjugal
dignities
to
invest
us
with
them
the
province
of
brittany
this
town
this
family
of
ancient
morals
and
ancient
customs
has
in
spite
of
certain
absurdities
which
strike
the
eye
of
a
frivolous
parisian
girl
something
inexplicable
something
grandiose
even
in
its
trifles
which
can
only
be
defined
by
the
word
all
the
tenants
of
the
vast
domains
of
the
house
of
guenic
bought
back
as
you
know
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
whom
we
are
going
to
visit
in
her
convent
have
been
in
a
body
to
pay
their
respects
to
us
these
worthy
people
in
their
holiday
costumes
expressing
their
genuine
joy
in
the
fact
that
calyste
has
now
become
really
and
truly
their
master
made
me
understand
brittany
the
feudal
system
and
france
the
whole
scene
was
a
festival
i
can
t
describe
to
you
in
writing
but
i
will
tell
you
about
it
when
we
meet
the
terms
of
the
leases
have
been
proposed
by
the
themselves
we
shall
sign
them
after
making
a
tour
of
inspection
round
the
estates
which
have
been
mortgaged
away
from
us
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
mademoiselle
de
told
me
that
the
have
reckoned
up
the
revenues
and
estimated
the
rentals
with
a
veracity
and
justice
parisians
would
never
believe
we
start
in
three
days
on
horseback
for
this
trip
i
will
write
you
on
my
return
dear
mother
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
about
myself
for
my
happiness
is
at
its
height
and
how
can
that
be
told
i
shall
write
you
only
what
you
know
already
and
that
is
how
i
love
you
nantes
june
having
now
played
the
role
of
a
chatelaine
adored
by
her
vassals
as
if
the
revolutions
of
and
had
lowered
no
banners
and
after
rides
through
forests
and
halts
at
farmhouses
dinners
on
oaken
tables
covered
with
centenary
linen
bending
under
homeric
viands
served
on
antediluvian
dishes
after
drinking
the
choicest
wines
in
goblets
to
volleys
of
musketry
accompanied
by
cries
of
long
live
the
guenics
till
i
was
deafened
after
balls
where
the
only
orchestra
was
a
bagpipe
blown
by
a
man
for
ten
hours
and
after
bouquets
and
young
brides
who
wanted
us
to
bless
them
and
downright
weariness
which
made
me
find
in
my
bed
a
sleep
i
never
knew
before
with
delightful
awakenings
when
love
shone
radiant
as
the
sun
pouring
in
upon
me
and
scintillating
with
a
million
of
flies
all
buzzing
in
the
breton
dialect
in
short
after
a
most
grotesque
residence
in
the
chateau
du
guenic
where
the
windows
are
gates
and
the
cows
graze
peacefully
on
the
grass
in
the
halls
which
castle
we
have
sworn
to
repair
and
to
inhabit
for
a
while
very
year
to
the
wild
acclamations
of
the
clan
du
guenic
a
of
which
bore
high
our
banner
ouf
i
am
at
nantes
but
oh
what
a
day
was
that
when
we
arrived
at
the
old
castle
the
rector
came
out
mother
with
all
his
clergy
crowned
with
flowers
to
receive
us
and
bless
us
expressing
such
joy
the
tears
are
in
my
eyes
as
i
think
of
it
and
my
noble
calyste
who
played
his
part
of
seigneur
like
a
personage
in
walter
scott
my
lord
received
his
tenants
homage
as
if
he
were
back
in
the
thirteenth
century
i
heard
the
girls
and
the
women
saying
to
each
other
oh
what
a
beautiful
seigneur
we
have
for
all
the
world
like
an
opera
chorus
the
old
men
talked
of
calyste
s
resemblance
to
the
former
guenics
whom
they
had
known
in
their
youth
ah
noble
sublime
brittany
land
of
belief
and
faith
but
progress
has
got
its
eye
upon
it
bridges
are
being
built
roads
made
ideas
are
coming
and
then
farewell
to
the
sublime
the
peasants
will
certainly
not
be
as
free
and
proud
as
i
have
now
seen
them
when
progress
has
proved
to
them
that
they
are
calyste
s
equals
if
indeed
they
could
ever
be
got
to
believe
it
after
this
poem
of
our
pacific
restoration
had
been
sung
and
the
contracts
and
leases
signed
we
left
that
ravishing
land
all
flowery
gay
solemn
lonely
by
turns
and
came
here
to
kneel
with
our
happiness
at
the
feet
of
her
who
gave
it
to
us
calyste
and
i
both
felt
the
need
of
thanking
the
sister
of
the
visitation
in
memory
of
her
he
has
quartered
his
own
arms
with
those
of
des
touches
which
are
party
couped
tranche
and
taille
or
and
sinople
on
the
latter
two
eagles
argent
he
means
to
take
one
of
the
eagles
argent
for
his
own
supporter
and
put
this
motto
in
its
beak
yesterday
we
went
to
the
convent
of
the
ladies
of
the
visitation
to
which
we
were
taken
by
the
abbe
grimont
a
friend
of
the
du
guenic
family
who
told
us
that
your
dear
felicite
mamma
was
indeed
a
saint
she
could
not
very
well
be
anything
else
to
him
for
her
conversion
which
was
thought
to
be
his
doing
has
led
to
his
appointment
as
of
the
diocese
mademoiselle
des
touches
declined
to
receive
calyste
and
would
only
see
me
i
found
her
slightly
changed
thinner
and
paler
but
she
seemed
much
pleased
at
my
visit
tell
calyste
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
it
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
me
not
to
see
him
for
i
am
permitted
to
do
so
i
prefer
not
to
buy
that
happiness
by
months
of
suffering
ah
you
do
not
know
what
it
costs
me
to
reply
to
the
question
of
what
are
you
thinking
certainly
the
mother
of
the
novices
has
no
conception
of
the
number
and
extent
of
the
ideas
which
are
rushing
through
my
mind
when
she
asks
that
question
sometimes
i
am
seeing
italy
or
paris
with
all
its
sights
always
thinking
however
of
calyste
who
is
she
said
this
in
that
poetic
way
you
know
and
admire
so
much
who
is
the
sun
of
memory
to
me
i
found
she
continued
that
i
was
too
old
to
be
received
among
the
carmelites
and
i
have
entered
the
order
of
de
sales
solely
because
he
said
i
will
bare
your
heads
instead
of
your
feet
objecting
as
he
did
to
austerities
which
mortified
the
body
only
it
is
in
truth
the
head
that
sins
the
saintly
bishop
was
right
to
make
his
rule
austere
toward
the
intellect
and
terrible
against
the
will
that
is
what
i
sought
for
my
head
was
the
guilty
part
of
me
it
deceived
me
as
to
my
heart
until
i
reached
that
fatal
age
of
forty
when
for
a
few
brief
moments
we
are
forty
times
happier
than
young
women
and
then
speedily
fifty
times
more
unhappy
but
my
child
tell
me
she
asked
ceasing
with
visible
satisfaction
to
speak
of
herself
are
you
happy
you
see
me
under
all
the
enchantments
of
love
and
happiness
i
answered
calyste
is
as
good
and
simple
as
he
is
noble
and
beautiful
she
said
gravely
i
have
made
you
my
heiress
in
more
things
than
property
you
now
possess
the
double
ideal
of
which
i
dreamed
i
rejoice
in
what
i
have
done
she
continued
after
a
pause
but
my
child
make
no
mistake
do
yourself
no
wrong
you
have
easily
won
happiness
you
have
only
to
stretch
out
your
hand
to
take
it
and
it
is
yours
but
be
careful
to
preserve
it
if
you
had
come
here
solely
to
carry
away
with
you
the
counsels
that
my
knowledge
of
your
husband
alone
can
give
you
the
journey
would
be
well
repaid
calyste
is
moved
at
this
moment
by
a
communicated
passion
but
you
have
not
inspired
it
to
make
your
happiness
lasting
try
my
dear
child
to
give
him
something
of
his
former
emotions
in
the
interests
of
both
of
you
be
capricious
be
coquettish
to
tell
you
the
truth
you
be
i
am
not
advising
any
odious
scheming
or
petty
tyranny
this
that
i
tell
you
is
the
science
of
a
woman
s
life
between
usury
and
prodigality
my
child
is
economy
study
therefore
to
acquire
honorably
a
certain
empire
over
calyste
these
are
the
last
words
on
earthly
interests
that
i
shall
ever
utter
and
i
have
kept
them
to
say
as
we
part
for
there
are
times
when
i
tremble
in
my
conscience
lest
to
save
calyste
i
may
have
sacrificed
you
bind
him
to
you
firmly
give
him
children
let
him
respect
their
mother
in
you
and
she
added
in
a
low
and
trembling
voice
manage
if
you
can
that
he
shall
never
again
see
that
name
plunged
us
both
into
a
sort
of
stupor
we
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
exchanging
a
vague
uneasiness
do
you
return
to
guerande
she
asked
me
yes
i
said
never
go
to
les
touches
i
did
wrong
to
give
him
that
why
i
asked
child
she
answered
les
touches
for
you
is
bluebeard
s
chamber
there
is
nothing
so
dangerous
as
to
wake
a
sleeping
i
have
given
you
dear
mamma
the
substance
or
at
any
rate
the
meaning
of
our
conversation
if
mademoiselle
des
touches
made
me
talk
to
her
freely
she
also
gave
me
much
to
think
of
and
all
the
more
because
in
the
delight
of
this
trip
and
the
charm
of
these
relations
with
my
calyste
i
had
forgotten
the
serious
situation
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
in
my
first
letter
and
about
which
you
warned
me
but
oh
mother
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
follow
these
counsels
i
can
not
put
an
appearance
of
opposition
or
caprice
into
my
love
it
would
falsify
it
calyste
will
do
with
me
what
he
pleases
according
to
your
theory
the
more
i
am
a
woman
the
more
i
make
myself
his
toy
for
i
am
and
i
know
it
horribly
weak
in
my
happiness
i
can
not
resist
a
single
glance
of
my
lord
but
no
i
do
not
abandon
myself
to
love
i
only
cling
to
it
as
a
mother
presses
her
infant
to
her
breast
fearing
some
evil
when
beatrix
was
first
published
in
the
volume
ended
with
the
following
paragraph
calyste
rich
and
married
to
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
paris
retains
a
sadness
in
his
soul
which
nothing
dissipates
not
even
the
birth
of
a
son
at
guerande
in
to
the
great
joy
of
zephirine
du
guenic
beatrix
lives
still
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
and
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
what
disasters
might
result
should
he
again
meet
with
madame
de
in
this
concluding
paragraph
was
suppressed
and
the
story
continued
as
here
tr
xviii
the
end
of
a
guerande
july
to
madame
la
duchesse
de
grandlieu
ah
my
dear
mamma
at
the
end
of
three
months
to
know
what
it
is
to
be
jealous
my
heart
completes
its
experience
i
now
feel
the
deepest
hatred
and
the
deepest
love
i
am
more
than
betrayed
i
am
not
loved
how
fortunate
for
me
to
have
a
mother
a
heart
on
which
to
cry
out
as
i
will
it
is
enough
to
say
to
wives
who
are
still
half
girls
here
s
a
key
rusty
with
memories
among
those
of
your
palace
go
everywhere
enjoy
everything
but
keep
away
from
les
touches
to
make
us
eager
to
go
there
our
eyes
shining
with
the
curiosity
of
eve
what
a
root
of
bitterness
mademoiselle
des
touches
planted
in
my
love
why
did
she
forbid
me
to
go
to
les
touches
what
sort
of
happiness
is
mine
if
it
depends
on
an
excursion
on
a
visit
to
a
paltry
house
in
brittany
why
should
i
fear
is
there
anything
to
fear
add
to
this
reasoning
of
the
desire
that
nips
all
women
to
know
if
their
power
is
solid
or
precarious
and
you
ll
understand
how
it
was
that
i
said
one
day
with
an
unconcerned
little
air
what
sort
of
place
is
les
touches
les
touches
belongs
to
you
said
my
divine
dear
if
calyste
had
never
set
foot
in
les
touches
cried
my
aunt
zephirine
shaking
her
head
he
would
not
be
my
husband
i
added
then
you
know
what
happened
there
said
my
slyly
it
is
a
place
of
perdition
exclaimed
mademoiselle
de
mademoiselle
des
touches
committed
many
sins
there
for
which
she
is
now
asking
the
pardon
of
but
they
saved
the
soul
of
that
noble
woman
and
made
the
fortune
of
a
convent
cried
the
chevalier
du
halga
the
abbe
grimont
told
me
she
had
given
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
the
nuns
of
the
should
you
like
to
go
to
les
touches
asked
my
it
is
worth
no
no
i
said
hastily
doesn
t
this
little
scene
read
to
you
like
a
page
out
of
some
diabolical
drama
it
was
repeated
again
and
again
under
various
pretexts
at
last
my
said
to
me
i
understand
why
you
do
not
go
to
les
touches
and
i
think
you
are
oh
you
must
admit
mamma
that
an
involuntary
unconscious
stab
like
that
would
have
decided
you
to
find
out
if
your
happiness
rested
on
such
a
frail
foundation
that
it
would
perish
at
a
mere
touch
to
do
calyste
justice
he
never
proposed
to
me
to
visit
that
hermitage
now
his
property
but
as
soon
as
we
love
we
are
creatures
devoid
of
and
this
silence
this
reserve
piqued
me
so
i
said
to
him
one
day
what
are
you
afraid
of
at
les
touches
that
you
alone
never
speak
of
the
place
let
us
go
there
he
replied
so
there
i
was
like
other
women
who
want
to
be
caught
and
who
trust
to
chance
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
their
indecision
so
to
les
touches
we
went
it
is
enchanting
in
a
style
profoundly
artistic
i
took
delight
in
that
place
of
horror
where
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
so
earnestly
forbidden
me
to
go
poisonous
flowers
are
all
charming
satan
sowed
them
for
the
devil
has
flowers
as
well
as
god
we
have
only
to
look
within
our
souls
to
see
the
two
shared
in
the
making
of
us
what
delicious
acrity
in
a
situation
where
i
played
not
with
fire
but
with
ashes
i
studied
calyste
the
point
was
to
know
if
that
passion
was
thoroughly
extinct
i
watched
as
you
may
well
believe
every
wind
that
blew
i
kept
an
eye
upon
his
face
as
he
went
from
room
to
room
and
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
exactly
like
a
child
who
is
looking
for
some
hidden
thing
calyste
seemed
thoughtful
but
at
first
i
thought
that
i
had
vanquished
the
past
i
felt
strong
enough
to
mention
madame
de
in
my
heart
i
called
la
rocheperfide
at
last
we
went
to
see
the
famous
bush
were
beatrix
was
caught
when
he
flung
her
into
the
sea
that
she
might
never
belong
to
another
man
she
must
be
light
indeed
to
have
stayed
there
i
said
laughing
calyste
kept
silence
so
i
added
we
ll
respect
the
still
calyste
was
silent
have
i
displeased
you
i
asked
no
but
cease
to
galvanize
that
passion
he
answered
what
a
speech
calyste
when
he
saw
me
all
cast
down
by
it
redoubled
his
care
and
tenderness
august
i
was
alas
at
the
edge
of
a
precipice
amusing
myself
like
the
innocent
heroines
of
all
melodramas
by
gathering
flowers
suddenly
a
horrible
thought
rode
full
tilt
through
my
happiness
like
the
horse
in
the
german
ballad
i
thought
i
saw
that
calyste
s
love
was
increasing
through
his
reminiscences
that
he
was
expending
on
the
stormy
emotions
i
revived
by
reminding
him
of
the
coquetries
of
that
hateful
beatrix
just
think
of
it
that
cold
unhealthy
nature
so
persistent
yet
so
flabby
something
between
a
mollusk
and
a
bit
of
coral
dares
to
call
itself
beatrix
already
dearest
mother
i
am
forced
to
keep
one
eye
open
to
suspicion
when
my
heart
is
all
calyste
s
and
isn
t
it
a
great
catastrophe
when
the
eye
gets
the
better
of
the
heart
and
suspicion
at
last
finds
itself
justified
it
came
to
pass
in
this
way
this
place
is
dear
to
me
i
said
to
calyste
one
morning
because
i
owe
my
happiness
to
it
and
so
i
forgive
you
for
taking
me
sometimes
for
another
the
loyal
breton
blushed
and
i
threw
my
arms
around
his
neck
but
all
the
same
i
have
left
les
touches
and
never
will
i
go
back
there
again
the
very
strength
of
hatred
which
makes
me
long
for
madame
de
rochefide
s
death
ah
heavens
a
natural
death
pleurisy
or
some
accident
makes
me
also
understand
to
its
fullest
extent
the
power
of
my
love
for
calyste
that
woman
has
appeared
to
me
to
trouble
my
sleep
i
see
her
in
a
dream
shall
i
ever
encounter
her
bodily
ah
the
postulant
of
the
visitation
was
right
les
touches
is
a
fatal
spot
calyste
has
there
recovered
his
past
emotions
and
they
are
i
see
it
plainly
more
powerful
than
the
joys
of
our
love
ascertain
my
dear
mamma
if
madame
de
rochefide
is
in
paris
for
if
she
is
i
shall
stay
in
brittany
poor
mademoiselle
des
touches
might
well
repent
of
her
share
in
our
marriage
if
she
knew
to
what
extent
i
am
taken
for
our
odious
rival
but
this
is
prostitution
i
am
not
myself
i
am
ashamed
of
it
all
a
frantic
desire
seizes
me
sometimes
to
fly
from
guerande
and
those
sands
of
croisic
august
i
am
determined
to
go
and
live
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
chateau
calyste
worried
by
my
restlessness
agrees
to
take
me
either
he
knows
life
so
little
that
he
guesses
nothing
or
he
know
the
cause
of
my
flight
in
which
case
he
can
not
love
me
i
tremble
so
with
fear
lest
i
find
the
awful
certainty
i
seek
that
like
a
child
i
put
my
hands
before
my
eyes
not
to
hear
the
explosion
oh
mother
i
am
not
loved
with
the
love
that
i
feel
in
my
heart
calyste
is
charming
to
me
that
s
true
but
what
man
unless
he
were
a
monster
would
not
be
as
calyste
is
amiable
and
gracious
when
receiving
all
the
flowers
of
the
soul
of
a
young
girl
of
twenty
brought
up
by
you
pure
loving
and
beautiful
as
many
women
have
said
to
you
that
i
am
guenic
september
has
he
forgotten
her
that
s
the
solitary
thought
which
echoes
through
my
soul
like
a
remorse
ah
dear
mamma
have
all
women
to
struggle
against
memories
as
i
do
none
but
innocent
young
men
should
be
married
to
pure
young
girls
but
that
s
a
deceptive
utopia
better
have
one
s
rival
in
the
past
than
in
the
future
ah
mother
pity
me
though
at
this
moment
i
am
happy
as
a
woman
who
fears
to
lose
her
happiness
and
so
clings
fast
to
it
one
way
of
killing
it
says
that
profoundly
wise
clotilde
i
notice
that
for
the
last
five
months
i
think
only
of
myself
that
is
of
calyste
tell
sister
clotilde
that
her
melancholy
bits
of
wisdom
often
recur
to
me
she
is
happy
in
being
faithful
to
the
dead
she
fears
no
rival
a
kiss
to
my
dear
athenais
about
whom
i
see
juste
is
beside
himself
from
what
you
told
me
in
your
last
letter
it
is
evident
he
fears
you
will
not
give
her
to
him
cultivate
that
fear
as
a
precious
product
athenais
will
be
sovereign
lady
but
i
who
fear
lest
i
can
never
win
calyste
back
from
himself
shall
always
be
a
servant
a
thousand
tendernesses
dear
mamma
ah
if
my
terrors
are
not
delusions
camille
maupin
has
sold
me
her
fortune
dearly
my
affectionate
respects
to
papa
these
letters
give
a
perfect
explanation
of
the
secret
relation
between
husband
and
wife
sabine
thought
of
a
love
marriage
where
calyste
saw
only
a
marriage
of
expediency
the
joys
of
the
had
not
altogether
conformed
to
the
legal
requirements
of
the
social
system
during
the
stay
of
the
married
pair
in
brittany
the
work
of
restoring
and
furnishing
the
hotel
du
guenic
had
been
carried
on
by
the
celebrated
architect
grindot
under
the
superintendence
of
clotilde
and
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
grandlieu
all
arrangements
having
been
made
for
the
return
of
the
young
household
to
paris
in
december
sabine
installed
herself
in
the
rue
de
bourbon
with
pleasure
less
for
the
satisfaction
of
playing
mistress
of
a
great
household
than
for
that
of
knowing
what
her
family
would
think
of
her
marriage
calyste
with
easy
indifference
was
quite
willing
to
let
his
clotilde
and
his
the
duchess
guide
him
in
all
matters
of
social
life
and
they
were
both
very
grateful
for
his
obedience
he
obtained
the
place
in
society
which
was
due
to
his
name
his
fortune
and
his
alliance
the
success
of
his
wife
who
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
charming
women
in
paris
the
diversions
of
high
society
the
duties
to
be
fulfilled
the
winter
amusements
of
the
great
city
gave
a
certain
fresh
life
to
the
happiness
of
the
young
household
by
producing
a
series
of
excitements
and
interludes
sabine
considered
happy
by
her
mother
and
sister
who
saw
in
calyste
s
coolness
an
effect
of
his
english
education
cast
aside
her
gloomy
notions
she
heard
her
lot
so
envied
by
many
unhappily
married
women
that
she
drove
her
terrors
from
her
into
the
region
of
chimeras
until
the
time
when
her
pregnancy
gave
additional
guarantees
to
this
neutral
sort
of
union
guarantees
which
are
usually
augured
well
of
by
experienced
women
in
october
the
young
baronne
du
guenic
had
a
son
and
committed
the
mistake
of
nursing
it
herself
on
the
theory
of
most
women
in
such
cases
how
is
it
possible
they
think
not
to
be
wholly
the
mother
of
the
child
of
an
idolized
husband
toward
the
end
of
the
following
summer
in
august
sabine
had
nearly
reached
the
period
when
the
duty
of
nursing
her
first
child
would
come
to
an
end
calyste
during
his
two
years
residence
in
paris
had
completely
thrown
off
that
innocence
of
mind
the
charm
of
which
had
so
adorned
his
earliest
appearance
in
the
world
of
passion
he
was
now
the
comrade
of
the
young
duc
georges
de
maufrigneuse
lately
married
like
himself
to
an
heiress
berthe
de
of
the
vicomte
savinien
de
portenduere
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
rhetore
the
duc
and
duchesse
de
and
all
the
of
his
s
salon
and
he
fully
understood
by
this
time
the
differences
that
separated
parisian
life
from
the
life
of
the
provinces
wealth
has
fatal
hours
hours
of
leisure
and
idleness
which
paris
knows
better
than
all
other
capitals
how
to
amuse
charm
and
divert
contact
with
those
young
husbands
who
deserted
the
noblest
and
sweetest
of
creatures
for
the
delights
of
a
cigar
and
whist
for
the
glorious
conversations
of
a
club
or
the
excitements
of
the
turf
undermined
before
long
many
of
the
domestic
virtues
of
the
young
breton
noble
the
motherly
solicitude
of
a
wife
who
is
anxious
not
to
weary
her
husband
always
comes
to
the
support
of
the
dissipations
of
young
men
a
wife
is
proud
to
see
her
husband
return
to
her
when
she
has
allowed
him
full
liberty
of
action
one
evening
on
october
of
that
year
to
escape
the
crying
of
the
newly
weaned
child
calyste
on
whose
forehead
sabine
could
not
endure
to
see
a
frown
went
urged
by
her
to
the
varietes
where
a
new
play
was
to
be
given
for
the
first
time
the
footman
whose
business
it
was
to
engage
a
stall
had
taken
it
quite
near
to
that
part
of
the
theatre
which
is
called
the
as
calyste
looked
about
him
during
the
first
interlude
he
saw
in
one
of
the
two
proscenium
boxes
on
his
side
and
not
ten
steps
from
him
madame
de
rochefide
beatrix
in
paris
beatrix
in
public
the
two
thoughts
flew
through
calyste
s
heart
like
arrows
to
see
her
again
after
nearly
three
years
how
shall
we
depict
the
convulsion
in
the
soul
of
this
lover
who
far
from
forgetting
the
past
had
sometimes
substituted
beatrix
for
his
wife
so
plainly
that
his
wife
had
perceived
it
beatrix
was
light
life
motion
and
the
unknown
sabine
was
duty
dulness
and
the
expected
one
became
in
a
moment
pleasure
the
other
weariness
it
was
the
falling
of
a
thunderbolt
from
a
sense
of
loyalty
the
first
thought
of
sabine
s
husband
was
to
leave
the
theatre
as
he
left
the
door
of
the
orchestra
stalls
he
saw
the
door
of
the
proscenium
box
and
his
feet
took
him
there
in
spite
of
his
will
the
young
breton
found
beatrix
between
two
very
distinguished
men
canalis
and
raoul
nathan
a
statesman
and
a
man
of
letters
in
the
three
years
since
calyste
had
seen
her
madame
de
rochefide
was
amazingly
changed
and
yet
although
the
transformation
had
seriously
affected
her
as
a
woman
she
was
only
the
more
poetic
and
the
more
attractive
to
calyste
until
the
age
of
thirty
the
pretty
women
of
paris
ask
nothing
more
of
their
toilet
than
clothing
but
after
they
pass
through
the
fatal
portal
of
the
thirties
they
look
for
weapons
seductions
embellishments
among
their
out
of
these
they
compose
charms
they
find
means
they
take
a
style
they
seize
youth
they
study
the
slightest
accessory
in
a
word
they
pass
from
nature
to
art
madame
de
rochefide
had
just
come
through
the
vicissitudes
of
a
drama
which
in
this
history
of
the
manners
and
morals
of
france
in
the
nineteenth
century
may
be
called
that
of
the
deserted
woman
deserted
by
conti
she
became
naturally
a
great
artist
in
dress
in
coquetry
in
artificial
flowers
of
all
kinds
why
is
conti
not
here
inquired
calyste
in
a
low
voice
of
canalis
after
going
through
the
commonplace
civilities
with
which
even
the
most
solemn
interviews
begin
when
they
take
place
publicly
the
former
great
poet
of
the
faubourg
twice
a
cabinet
minister
and
now
for
the
fourth
time
an
orator
in
the
chamber
and
aspiring
to
another
ministry
laid
a
warning
finger
significantly
on
his
lip
that
gesture
explained
everything
i
am
happy
to
see
you
said
beatrix
demurely
i
said
to
myself
when
i
recognized
you
just
now
before
you
saw
me
that
at
least
would
not
disown
me
ah
my
calyste
she
added
in
a
whisper
why
did
you
marry
and
with
such
a
little
fool
as
soon
as
a
woman
whispers
in
the
ear
of
a
and
makes
him
sit
beside
her
men
of
the
world
find
an
immediate
excuse
for
leaving
the
pair
alone
together
come
nathan
said
canalis
madame
la
marquise
will
i
am
sure
allow
me
to
go
and
say
a
word
to
d
arthez
whom
i
see
over
there
with
the
princesse
de
cadignan
it
relates
to
some
business
in
the
chamber
this
departure
gave
calyste
time
to
recover
from
the
shock
he
had
just
received
but
he
nearly
lost
both
his
strength
and
his
senses
once
more
as
he
inhaled
the
perfume
to
him
entrancing
though
venomous
of
the
poem
composed
by
beatrix
madame
de
rochefide
now
become
bony
and
gaunt
her
complexion
faded
and
almost
discolored
her
eyes
hollow
with
deep
circles
had
that
evening
brightened
those
premature
ruins
by
the
cleverest
contrivances
of
the
she
had
taken
it
into
her
head
like
other
deserted
women
to
assume
a
virgin
air
and
recall
by
clouds
of
white
material
the
maidens
of
ossian
so
poetically
painted
by
girodet
her
fair
hair
draped
her
elongated
face
with
a
mass
of
curls
among
which
rippled
the
rays
of
the
attracted
by
the
shining
of
a
perfumed
oil
her
white
brow
sparkled
she
had
applied
an
imperceptible
tinge
of
rouge
to
her
cheeks
upon
the
faded
whiteness
of
a
skin
revived
by
bran
and
water
a
scarf
so
delicate
in
texture
that
it
made
one
doubt
if
human
fingers
could
have
fabricated
such
gossamer
was
wound
about
her
throat
to
diminish
its
length
and
partly
conceal
it
leaving
imperfectly
visible
the
treasures
of
the
bust
which
were
cleverly
enclosed
in
a
corset
her
figure
was
indeed
a
masterpiece
of
composition
as
for
her
pose
one
word
will
suffice
it
was
worthy
of
the
pains
she
had
taken
to
arrange
it
her
arms
now
thin
and
hard
were
scarcely
visible
within
the
puffings
of
her
very
large
sleeves
she
presented
that
mixture
of
false
glitter
and
brilliant
fabrics
of
silken
gauze
and
craped
hair
of
vivacity
calmness
and
motion
which
goes
by
the
term
of
the
ne
sais
everybody
knows
in
what
that
consists
namely
great
cleverness
some
taste
and
a
certain
composure
of
manner
beatrix
might
now
be
called
a
decorative
scenic
effect
changed
at
will
and
wonderfully
manipulated
the
presentation
of
this
fairy
effect
to
which
is
added
clever
dialogue
turns
the
heads
of
men
who
are
endowed
by
nature
with
frankness
until
they
become
possessed
through
the
law
of
contrasts
by
a
frantic
desire
to
play
with
artifice
it
is
false
though
enticing
a
pretence
but
agreeable
and
certain
men
adore
women
who
play
at
seduction
as
others
do
at
cards
and
this
is
why
the
desire
of
the
man
is
a
syllogism
which
draws
conclusions
from
this
external
science
as
to
the
secret
promises
of
pleasure
the
inner
consciousness
says
without
words
a
woman
who
can
as
it
were
create
herself
beautiful
must
have
many
other
resources
for
and
that
is
true
deserted
women
are
usually
those
who
merely
love
those
who
retain
love
know
the
of
loving
now
though
her
italian
lesson
had
very
cruelly
maltreated
the
and
vanity
of
madame
de
rochefide
her
nature
was
too
instinctively
artificial
not
to
profit
by
it
it
is
not
a
question
of
loving
a
man
she
was
saying
a
few
moments
before
calyste
had
entered
her
box
we
must
tease
and
harass
him
if
we
want
to
keep
him
that
s
the
secret
of
all
those
women
who
seek
to
retain
you
men
the
dragons
who
guard
treasures
are
always
armed
with
claws
and
i
shall
make
a
sonnet
on
that
thought
replied
canalis
at
the
very
moment
when
calyste
entered
the
box
with
a
single
glance
beatrix
divined
the
state
of
calyste
s
heart
she
saw
the
marks
of
the
collar
she
had
put
upon
him
at
les
touches
still
fresh
and
red
calyste
however
wounded
by
the
speech
made
to
him
about
his
wife
hesitated
between
his
dignity
as
a
husband
sabine
s
defence
and
a
harsh
word
cast
upon
a
heart
which
held
such
memories
for
him
a
heart
which
he
believed
to
be
bleeding
the
marquise
observed
his
hesitation
she
had
made
that
speech
expressly
that
she
might
know
how
far
her
empire
over
calyste
still
extended
seeing
his
weakness
she
came
at
once
to
his
succor
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
well
dear
friend
you
find
me
alone
she
said
as
soon
as
the
two
gentlemen
had
left
the
box
yes
alone
in
the
world
you
forget
me
said
calyste
you
she
replied
but
you
are
married
that
was
one
of
my
griefs
among
the
many
i
have
endured
since
i
saw
you
last
not
only
i
said
to
myself
do
i
lose
love
but
i
have
lost
a
friendship
which
i
thought
was
breton
alas
we
can
make
ourselves
bear
everything
now
i
suffer
less
but
i
am
broken
exhausted
this
is
the
first
outpouring
of
my
heart
for
a
long
long
time
obliged
to
seem
proud
before
indifferent
persons
and
arrogant
as
if
i
had
never
fallen
in
presence
of
those
who
pay
court
to
me
and
having
lost
my
dear
felicite
there
was
no
ear
into
which
i
could
cast
the
words
suffer
but
to
you
i
can
tell
the
anguish
i
endured
on
seeing
you
just
now
so
near
to
me
yes
she
said
replying
to
a
gesture
of
calyste
s
it
is
almost
fidelity
that
is
how
it
is
with
misery
a
look
a
visit
a
mere
nothing
is
everything
to
us
ah
you
once
loved
me
you
as
i
deserved
to
be
loved
by
him
who
has
taken
pleasure
in
trampling
under
foot
the
treasures
i
poured
out
upon
him
and
yet
to
my
sorrow
i
can
not
forget
i
love
and
i
desire
to
be
faithful
to
a
past
that
can
never
having
uttered
this
tirade
improvised
for
the
hundredth
time
she
played
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
in
a
way
to
double
the
effect
of
her
words
which
seemed
to
be
dragged
from
the
depths
of
her
soul
by
the
violence
of
a
torrent
long
restrained
calyste
incapable
of
speech
let
fall
the
tears
that
gathered
in
his
eyes
beatrix
caught
his
hand
and
pressed
it
making
him
turn
pale
thank
you
calyste
thank
you
my
poor
child
that
is
how
a
true
friend
responds
to
the
grief
of
his
friend
we
understand
each
other
no
don
t
add
another
word
leave
me
now
people
are
looking
at
us
it
might
cause
trouble
to
your
wife
if
some
one
chanced
to
tell
her
that
we
were
seen
together
innocently
enough
before
a
thousand
people
there
you
see
i
am
strong
adieu
she
wiped
her
eyes
making
what
might
be
called
in
woman
s
rhetoric
an
antithesis
of
action
let
me
laugh
the
laugh
of
a
lost
soul
with
the
careless
creatures
who
amuse
me
she
went
on
i
live
among
artists
writers
in
short
the
world
i
knew
in
the
salon
of
our
poor
camille
who
may
indeed
have
acted
wisely
to
enrich
the
man
we
love
and
then
to
disappear
saying
i
am
too
old
for
him
that
is
ending
like
the
martyrs
and
the
best
end
too
if
one
can
not
die
a
she
began
to
laugh
as
it
to
remove
the
melancholy
impression
she
had
made
upon
her
former
adorer
but
said
calyste
where
can
i
go
to
see
you
i
am
hidden
in
the
rue
de
chartres
opposite
the
parc
de
monceaux
in
a
little
house
suitable
to
my
means
and
there
i
cram
my
head
with
literature
but
only
for
myself
to
distract
my
thoughts
god
keep
me
from
the
mania
of
literary
women
now
go
leave
me
i
must
not
allow
the
world
to
talk
of
me
what
will
it
not
say
on
seeing
us
together
adieu
oh
calyste
my
friend
if
you
stay
another
minute
i
shall
burst
into
tears
calyste
withdrew
after
holding
out
his
hand
to
beatrix
and
feeling
for
the
second
time
that
strange
and
deep
sensation
of
a
double
pressure
full
of
seductive
tingling
sabine
never
knew
how
to
stir
my
soul
in
that
way
was
the
thought
that
assailed
him
in
the
corridor
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
marquise
de
rochefide
did
not
cast
three
straight
glances
at
calyste
but
there
were
many
sidelong
looks
which
tore
of
the
soul
of
the
man
now
wholly
thrown
back
into
his
first
repulsed
love
when
the
baron
du
guenic
reached
home
the
splendor
of
his
apartments
made
him
think
of
the
sort
of
mediocrity
of
which
beatrix
had
spoken
and
he
hated
his
wealth
because
it
could
not
belong
to
that
fallen
angel
when
he
was
told
that
sabine
had
long
been
in
bed
he
rejoiced
to
find
himself
rich
in
the
possession
of
a
night
in
which
to
live
over
his
emotions
he
cursed
the
power
of
divination
which
love
had
bestowed
upon
sabine
when
by
chance
a
man
is
adored
by
his
wife
she
reads
on
his
face
as
in
a
book
she
learns
every
quiver
of
its
muscles
she
knows
whence
comes
its
calmness
she
asks
herself
the
reason
of
the
slightest
sadness
seeking
to
know
if
haply
the
cause
is
in
herself
she
studies
the
eyes
for
her
the
eyes
are
tinted
with
the
dominant
thought
they
love
or
they
do
not
love
calyste
knew
himself
to
be
the
object
of
so
deep
so
naive
so
jealous
a
worship
that
he
doubted
his
power
to
compose
a
cautious
face
that
should
not
betray
the
change
in
his
moral
being
how
shall
i
manage
morning
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
to
sleep
dreading
the
sort
of
inspection
to
which
sabine
would
have
recourse
when
they
came
together
at
night
and
sometimes
during
the
day
sabine
would
ask
him
do
you
still
love
me
or
i
don
t
weary
you
do
i
charming
interrogations
varied
according
to
the
nature
or
the
cleverness
of
women
which
hide
their
anxieties
either
feigned
or
real
to
the
surface
of
the
noblest
and
purest
hearts
the
mud
and
slime
cast
up
by
hurricanes
must
come
so
on
that
morrow
morning
calyste
who
certainly
loved
his
child
quivered
with
joy
on
learning
that
sabine
feared
the
croup
and
was
watching
for
the
cause
of
slight
convulsions
not
daring
to
leave
her
little
boy
the
baron
made
a
pretext
of
business
and
went
out
thus
avoiding
the
home
breakfast
he
escaped
as
prisoners
escape
happy
in
being
afoot
and
free
to
go
by
the
pont
louis
xvi
and
the
champs
elysees
to
a
cafe
on
the
boulevard
where
he
had
liked
to
breakfast
when
he
was
a
bachelor
what
is
there
in
love
does
nature
rebel
against
the
social
yoke
does
she
need
that
impulse
of
her
given
life
to
be
spontaneous
free
the
dash
of
an
impetuous
torrent
foaming
against
rocks
of
opposition
and
of
coquetry
rather
than
a
tranquil
stream
flowing
between
the
two
banks
of
the
church
and
the
legal
ceremony
has
she
her
own
designs
as
she
secretly
prepares
those
volcanic
eruptions
to
which
perhaps
we
owe
great
men
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
young
man
more
sacredly
brought
up
than
calyste
of
purer
morals
less
stained
by
irreligion
and
yet
he
bounded
toward
a
woman
unworthy
of
him
when
a
benign
and
radiant
chance
had
given
him
for
his
wife
a
young
creature
whose
beauty
was
truly
aristocratic
whose
mind
was
keen
and
delicate
a
pious
loving
girl
attached
singly
to
him
of
angelic
sweetness
and
made
more
tender
still
by
love
a
love
that
was
passionate
in
spite
of
marriage
like
his
for
beatrix
perhaps
the
noblest
men
retain
some
clay
in
their
constitutions
the
slough
still
pleases
them
if
this
be
so
the
least
imperfect
human
being
is
the
woman
in
spite
of
her
faults
and
her
want
of
reason
madame
de
rochefide
it
must
be
said
amid
the
circle
of
poetic
pretensions
which
surrounded
her
and
in
spite
of
her
fall
belonged
to
the
highest
nobility
she
presented
a
nature
more
ethereal
than
slimy
and
hid
the
courtesan
she
was
meant
to
be
beneath
an
aristocratic
exterior
therefore
the
above
explanation
does
not
fully
account
for
calyste
s
strange
passion
perhaps
we
ought
to
look
for
its
cause
in
a
vanity
so
deeply
buried
in
the
soul
that
moralists
have
not
yet
uncovered
that
side
of
vice
there
are
men
truly
noble
like
calyste
handsome
as
calyste
rich
distinguished
and
who
tire
without
their
knowledge
possibly
of
marriage
with
a
nature
like
their
own
beings
whose
own
nobleness
is
not
surprised
or
moved
by
nobleness
in
others
whom
grandeur
and
delicacy
consonant
with
their
own
does
not
affect
but
who
seek
from
inferior
or
fallen
natures
the
seal
of
their
own
superiority
if
indeed
they
do
not
openly
beg
for
praise
calyste
found
nothing
to
protect
in
sabine
she
was
irreproachable
the
powers
thus
stagnant
in
his
heart
were
now
to
vibrate
for
beatrix
if
great
men
have
played
before
our
eyes
the
saviour
s
part
toward
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
why
should
ordinary
men
be
wiser
in
their
generation
than
they
calyste
reached
the
hour
of
two
o
clock
living
on
one
sentence
only
i
shall
see
her
again
a
poem
which
has
often
paid
the
costs
of
a
journey
of
two
thousand
miles
he
now
went
with
a
light
step
to
the
rue
de
chartres
and
recognized
the
house
at
once
although
he
had
never
before
seen
it
once
there
he
stood
he
the
of
the
duc
de
grandlieu
he
rich
noble
as
the
bourbons
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
stopped
short
by
the
interrogation
of
the
old
footman
monsieur
s
name
calyste
felt
that
he
ought
to
leave
to
beatrix
her
freedom
of
action
in
receiving
or
not
receiving
him
and
he
waited
looking
into
the
garden
with
its
walls
furrowed
by
those
black
and
yellow
lines
produced
by
rain
upon
the
stucco
of
paris
madame
de
rochefide
like
nearly
all
great
ladies
who
break
their
chain
had
left
her
fortune
to
her
husband
when
she
fled
from
him
she
could
not
beg
from
her
tyrant
conti
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
spared
beatrix
all
the
petty
worries
of
material
life
and
her
mother
had
frequently
send
her
considerable
sums
of
money
finding
herself
now
on
her
own
resources
she
was
forced
to
an
economy
that
was
rather
severe
for
a
woman
accustomed
to
every
luxury
she
had
therefore
gone
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
on
which
lies
the
parc
de
monceaux
and
there
she
had
taken
refuge
in
a
little
house
formerly
belonging
to
a
great
seigneur
standing
on
the
street
but
possessed
of
a
charming
garden
the
rent
of
which
did
not
exceed
eighteen
hundred
francs
still
served
by
an
old
footman
a
maid
and
a
cook
from
alencon
who
were
faithful
to
her
throughout
her
vicissitudes
her
penury
as
she
thought
it
would
have
been
opulence
to
many
an
ambitious
bourgeoise
calyste
went
up
a
staircase
the
steps
of
which
were
well
pumiced
and
the
landings
filled
with
flowering
plants
on
the
first
floor
the
old
servant
opened
in
order
to
admit
the
baron
into
the
apartment
a
double
door
of
red
velvet
with
lozenges
of
red
silk
studded
with
gilt
nails
silk
and
velvet
furnished
the
rooms
through
which
calyste
passed
carpets
in
grave
colors
curtains
crossing
each
other
before
the
windows
portieres
in
short
all
things
within
contrasted
with
the
mean
external
appearance
of
the
house
which
was
by
the
proprietor
calyste
awaited
beatrix
in
a
salon
of
sober
character
where
all
the
luxury
was
simple
in
style
this
room
hung
with
garnet
velvet
heightened
here
and
there
with
silken
trimmings
the
floor
covered
with
a
dark
red
carpet
the
windows
resembling
conservatories
with
abundant
flowers
in
the
jardinieres
was
lighted
so
faintly
that
calyste
could
scarcely
see
on
a
two
cases
of
old
celadon
between
which
gleamed
a
silver
cup
attributed
to
benvenuto
cellini
and
brought
from
italy
by
beatrix
the
furniture
of
gilded
wood
with
velvet
coverings
the
magnificent
consoles
on
one
of
which
was
a
curious
clock
the
table
with
its
persian
cloth
all
bore
testimony
to
former
opulence
the
remains
of
which
had
been
well
applied
on
a
little
table
calyste
saw
jewelled
a
book
in
course
of
reading
in
which
glittered
the
handle
of
a
dagger
used
as
a
symbol
of
criticism
finally
on
the
walls
ten
richly
framed
each
representing
one
of
the
diverse
bedrooms
in
which
madame
de
rochefide
s
wandering
life
had
led
her
to
sojourn
gave
the
measure
of
what
was
surely
superior
impertinence
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
announced
the
poor
unfortunate
who
appeared
in
a
studied
toilet
which
would
certainly
have
told
a
that
his
coming
was
awaited
the
gown
made
like
a
wrapper
to
show
the
line
of
a
white
bosom
was
of
moire
with
large
open
sleeves
from
which
issued
the
arms
covered
with
a
second
sleeve
of
puffed
tulle
divided
by
straps
and
trimmed
with
lace
at
the
wrists
the
beautiful
hair
which
the
comb
held
insecurely
escaped
from
a
cap
of
lace
and
flowers
already
she
said
smiling
a
lover
could
not
have
shown
more
eagerness
you
must
have
secrets
to
tell
me
have
you
not
and
she
posed
herself
gracefully
on
a
sofa
inviting
calyste
by
a
gesture
to
sit
beside
her
by
chance
a
selected
chance
possibly
for
women
have
two
memories
that
of
angels
and
that
of
devils
beatrix
was
redolent
of
the
perfume
which
she
used
at
les
touches
during
her
first
acquaintance
with
calyste
the
inhaling
of
this
scent
contact
with
that
dress
the
glance
of
those
eyes
which
in
the
gathered
the
light
and
returned
it
turned
calyste
s
brain
the
luckless
man
was
again
impelled
to
that
violence
which
had
once
before
almost
cost
beatrix
her
life
but
this
time
the
marquise
was
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
not
on
that
of
a
rock
she
rose
to
ring
the
bell
laying
a
finger
on
his
lips
calyste
recalled
to
order
controlled
himself
all
the
more
because
he
saw
that
beatrix
had
no
inimical
intention
antoine
i
am
not
at
home
for
every
one
she
said
put
some
wood
on
the
fire
you
see
calyste
that
i
treat
you
as
a
friend
she
continued
with
dignity
when
the
old
man
had
left
the
room
therefore
do
not
treat
me
as
you
would
a
mistress
i
have
two
remarks
to
make
to
you
in
the
first
place
i
should
not
deny
myself
foolishly
to
any
man
i
really
loved
and
secondly
i
am
determined
to
belong
to
no
other
man
on
earth
for
i
believed
calyste
that
i
was
loved
by
a
species
of
rizzio
whom
no
engagement
trammelled
a
man
absolutely
free
and
you
see
to
what
that
fatal
confidence
has
led
me
as
for
you
you
are
now
under
the
yoke
of
the
most
sacred
of
duties
you
have
a
young
amiable
delightful
wife
moreover
you
are
a
father
i
should
be
as
you
are
without
excuse
we
should
be
two
fools
my
dear
beatrix
all
these
reasons
vanish
before
a
single
word
i
have
never
loved
but
you
on
earth
and
i
was
married
against
my
ah
a
trick
played
upon
us
by
mademoiselle
des
touches
she
said
smiling
three
hours
passed
during
which
madame
de
rochefide
held
calyste
to
the
consideration
of
conjugal
faith
pointing
out
to
him
the
horrible
alternative
of
an
utter
renunciation
of
sabine
nothing
else
could
reassure
her
she
said
in
the
dreadful
situation
to
which
calyste
s
love
would
reduce
her
then
she
affected
to
regard
the
sacrifice
of
sabine
as
a
small
matter
she
knew
her
so
well
my
dear
child
she
said
that
s
a
woman
who
fulfils
all
the
promises
of
her
girlhood
she
is
a
grandlieu
to
be
sure
but
she
s
as
brown
as
her
mother
the
portuguese
not
to
say
yellow
and
as
dry
and
stiff
as
her
father
to
tell
the
truth
your
wife
will
never
go
wrong
she
s
a
big
boy
who
can
take
care
of
herself
poor
calyste
is
that
the
sort
of
woman
you
needed
she
has
fine
eyes
but
such
eyes
are
very
common
in
italy
and
in
spain
and
portugal
can
any
woman
be
tender
with
bones
like
hers
eve
was
fair
brown
women
descend
from
adam
blondes
come
from
the
hand
of
god
which
left
upon
eve
his
last
thought
after
he
had
created
about
six
o
clock
calyste
driven
to
desperation
took
his
hat
to
depart
yes
go
my
poor
friend
she
said
don
t
give
her
the
annoyance
of
dining
without
calyste
stayed
at
his
age
it
was
so
easy
to
snare
him
on
his
worst
side
what
you
dare
to
dine
with
me
said
beatrix
playing
a
provocative
amazement
my
poor
food
does
not
alarm
you
have
you
enough
independence
of
soul
to
crown
me
with
joy
by
this
little
proof
of
your
affection
let
me
write
a
note
to
sabine
otherwise
she
will
wait
dinner
for
me
till
nine
o
here
said
beatrix
this
is
the
table
at
which
i
she
lighted
the
candles
herself
and
took
one
to
the
table
to
look
over
what
he
was
writing
dear
sabine
my
dear
can
you
really
say
that
your
wife
is
still
dear
to
you
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
a
cold
eye
that
froze
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
go
you
had
better
go
and
dine
with
dine
at
a
restaurant
with
some
a
lie
oh
fy
you
are
not
worthy
to
be
loved
either
by
her
or
by
me
men
are
all
cowards
in
their
treatment
of
women
go
monsieur
go
and
dine
with
your
dear
calyste
flung
himself
back
in
his
and
became
as
pale
as
death
bretons
possess
a
courage
of
nature
which
makes
them
obstinate
under
difficulties
presently
the
young
baron
sat
up
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
implacable
beatrix
with
a
flashing
eye
he
was
so
superb
that
a
northern
or
a
southern
woman
would
have
fallen
at
his
feet
saying
take
me
but
beatrix
born
on
the
borders
of
normandy
and
brittany
belonged
to
the
race
of
casterans
desertion
had
developed
in
her
the
ferocity
of
the
frank
the
spitefulness
of
the
norman
she
wanted
some
terrible
notoriety
as
a
vengeance
and
she
yielded
to
no
weakness
dictate
what
i
ought
to
write
said
the
luckless
man
but
in
that
case
well
yes
she
said
you
shall
love
me
then
as
you
loved
me
at
guerande
write
dine
out
do
not
expect
what
next
said
calyste
thinking
something
more
would
follow
nothing
sign
it
good
she
said
darting
on
the
note
with
restrained
joy
i
will
send
it
by
a
and
now
cried
calyste
rising
like
a
happy
man
ah
i
have
kept
i
believe
my
freedom
of
action
she
said
turning
away
from
him
and
going
to
the
fireplace
where
she
rang
the
bell
here
antoine
she
said
when
the
old
footman
entered
send
this
note
to
its
address
monsieur
dines
xix
the
first
lie
of
a
pious
duchess
calyste
returned
to
his
own
house
about
two
in
the
morning
after
waiting
for
him
till
twelve
sabine
had
gone
to
bed
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
she
slept
although
she
was
keenly
distressed
by
the
laconic
wording
of
her
husband
s
note
still
she
explained
it
the
true
love
of
a
woman
invariably
begins
by
explaining
all
things
to
the
advantage
of
the
man
beloved
calyste
was
pressed
for
time
she
said
the
next
morning
the
child
was
better
the
mother
s
uneasiness
subsided
and
sabine
came
with
a
smiling
face
and
little
calyste
on
her
arm
to
present
him
to
his
father
before
breakfast
with
the
pretty
fooleries
and
senseless
words
which
gay
young
mothers
do
and
say
this
little
scene
gave
calyste
the
chance
to
maintain
a
countenance
he
was
charming
to
his
wife
thinking
in
his
heart
that
he
was
a
monster
and
he
played
like
a
child
with
monsieur
le
chevalier
in
fact
he
played
too
well
he
overdid
the
part
but
sabine
had
not
reached
the
stage
at
which
a
woman
recognizes
so
delicate
a
distinction
at
breakfast
however
she
asked
him
suddenly
what
did
you
do
yesterday
portenduere
kept
me
to
dinner
he
replied
and
after
that
we
went
to
the
club
to
play
that
s
a
foolish
life
my
calyste
said
sabine
young
noblemen
in
these
days
ought
to
busy
themselves
about
recovering
in
the
eyes
of
the
country
the
ground
lost
by
their
fathers
it
isn
t
by
smoking
cigars
playing
whist
idling
away
their
leisure
and
saying
insolent
things
of
parvenus
who
have
driven
them
from
their
positions
nor
yet
by
separating
themselves
from
the
masses
whose
soul
and
intellect
and
providence
they
ought
to
be
that
the
nobility
will
exist
instead
of
being
a
party
you
will
soon
be
a
mere
opinion
as
de
marsay
said
ah
if
you
only
knew
how
my
ideas
on
this
subject
have
enlarged
since
i
have
nursed
and
cradled
your
child
i
d
like
to
see
that
grand
old
name
of
guenic
become
once
more
historical
then
suddenly
plunging
her
eyes
into
those
of
calyste
who
was
listening
to
her
with
a
pensive
air
she
added
admit
that
the
first
note
you
ever
wrote
me
was
rather
i
did
not
think
of
sending
you
word
till
i
got
to
the
but
you
wrote
on
a
woman
s
it
had
a
perfume
of
feminine
those
club
directors
are
such
dandies
the
vicomte
de
portenduere
and
his
wife
formerly
mademoiselle
mirouet
had
become
of
late
very
intimate
with
the
du
guenics
so
intimate
that
they
shared
their
box
at
the
opera
by
equal
payments
the
two
young
women
ursula
and
sabine
had
been
won
to
this
friendship
by
the
delightful
interchange
of
counsels
cares
and
confidences
apropos
of
their
first
infants
while
calyste
a
novice
in
falsehood
was
saying
to
himself
i
must
warn
savinien
sabine
was
thinking
i
am
sure
that
paper
bore
a
this
reflection
passed
through
her
mind
like
a
flash
and
sabine
scolded
herself
for
having
made
it
nevertheless
she
resolved
to
find
the
paper
which
in
the
midst
of
her
terrors
of
the
night
before
she
had
flung
into
her
after
breakfast
calyste
went
out
saying
to
his
wife
that
he
should
soon
return
then
he
jumped
into
one
of
those
little
low
carriages
with
one
horse
which
were
just
beginning
to
supersede
the
inconvenient
cabriolet
of
our
ancestors
he
drove
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
vicomte
s
house
and
begged
him
to
do
him
the
service
with
rights
of
return
of
fibbing
in
case
sabine
should
question
the
vicomtesse
thence
calyste
urging
his
coachman
to
speed
rushed
to
the
rue
de
chartres
in
order
to
know
how
beatrix
had
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
he
found
that
unfortunate
just
from
her
bath
fresh
embellished
and
breakfasting
with
a
very
good
appetite
he
admired
the
grace
with
which
his
angel
ate
her
boiled
eggs
and
he
marvelled
at
the
beauty
of
the
gold
service
a
present
from
a
monomaniac
lord
for
whom
conti
had
composed
a
few
ballads
on
of
the
lord
who
afterwards
published
them
as
his
own
calyste
listened
entranced
to
the
witty
speeches
of
his
idol
whose
great
object
was
to
amuse
him
until
she
grew
angry
and
wept
when
he
rose
to
leave
her
he
thought
he
had
been
there
only
half
an
hour
but
it
was
past
three
before
he
reached
home
his
handsome
english
horse
a
present
from
the
vicomtesse
de
grandlieu
was
so
bathed
in
sweat
that
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
driven
through
the
sea
by
one
of
those
chances
which
all
jealous
women
prepare
for
themselves
sabine
was
at
a
window
which
looked
on
the
impatient
at
calyste
s
uneasy
without
knowing
why
the
condition
of
the
horse
with
its
foaming
mouth
surprised
her
where
can
he
have
come
from
the
question
was
whispered
in
her
ear
by
that
power
which
is
not
exactly
consciousness
nor
devil
nor
angel
which
sees
forebodes
shows
us
the
unseen
and
creates
belief
in
mental
beings
creatures
born
of
our
brains
going
and
coming
and
living
in
the
world
invisible
of
ideas
where
do
you
come
from
dear
angel
sabine
said
to
calyste
meeting
him
on
the
first
landing
of
the
staircase
is
nearly
foundered
you
told
me
you
would
be
gone
but
a
moment
and
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
these
three
well
well
thought
calyste
who
was
making
progress
in
dissimulation
i
must
get
out
of
it
by
a
present
dear
little
mother
he
said
aloud
taking
her
round
the
waist
with
more
cajolery
than
he
would
have
used
if
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
guilt
i
see
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
keep
a
secret
however
innocent
from
the
woman
who
loves
us
well
don
t
tell
secrets
on
the
staircase
she
said
laughing
come
in
the
middle
of
a
salon
which
adjoined
their
bedroom
she
caught
sight
in
a
mirror
of
calyste
s
face
on
which
not
aware
that
it
could
be
seen
he
allowed
his
real
feelings
and
his
weariness
to
appear
now
for
your
secret
she
said
turning
round
you
have
shown
such
heroism
as
a
nurse
he
said
that
the
heir
presumptive
of
the
guenics
is
dearer
to
me
than
ever
and
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
surprise
precisely
like
any
bourgeois
of
the
rue
saint
denis
they
are
finishing
for
you
at
this
moment
a
at
which
true
artists
have
worked
and
my
mother
and
aunt
zephirine
have
sabine
clasped
him
in
her
arms
and
held
him
tightly
to
her
breast
with
her
head
on
his
neck
faint
with
the
weight
of
happiness
not
for
the
piece
of
furniture
but
for
the
dispersion
of
her
first
dark
doubt
it
was
one
of
those
magnificent
transports
which
can
be
counted
and
which
no
love
however
excessive
can
prodigally
spend
or
life
would
be
too
soon
burned
out
then
indeed
men
should
fall
at
the
feet
of
women
to
adore
them
for
such
moments
are
sublime
moments
when
the
forces
of
the
heart
and
intellect
gush
forth
like
the
waters
of
sculptured
nymphs
from
their
inclining
urns
sabine
burst
into
tears
suddenly
as
if
bitten
by
a
viper
she
left
calyste
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
and
fainted
away
for
the
reaction
of
a
chill
to
her
glowing
heart
came
near
to
killing
her
as
she
held
calyste
in
her
arms
her
nose
at
his
cravat
abandoned
to
her
joy
she
smelt
the
perfume
of
that
letter
paper
another
woman
s
head
had
lain
there
whose
hair
and
face
had
left
that
adulterous
odor
she
had
just
kissed
the
spot
where
the
kisses
of
her
rival
were
still
warm
what
is
the
matter
asked
calyste
after
he
had
brought
sabine
back
to
consciousness
by
passing
a
damp
cloth
over
her
face
and
making
her
smell
salts
fetch
the
doctor
and
my
nurse
both
yes
my
milk
has
turned
i
feel
it
they
won
t
come
at
once
unless
you
fetch
them
yourself
go
calyste
alarmed
rushed
out
the
moment
sabine
heard
the
closing
of
the
she
started
up
like
a
frightened
doe
and
walked
about
the
salon
as
if
beside
herself
crying
out
my
god
my
god
my
god
those
two
words
took
the
place
of
all
ideas
the
crisis
she
had
seized
upon
as
a
pretext
in
reality
took
place
the
hairs
of
her
head
were
like
so
many
needles
heated
in
the
fire
of
a
nervous
fever
her
boiling
blood
seemed
to
her
to
mingle
with
her
nerves
and
yet
try
to
issue
from
all
her
pores
she
was
blind
for
a
few
moments
and
cried
aloud
i
am
dying
at
that
terrible
cry
of
the
injured
wife
and
mother
her
maid
ran
in
after
she
was
laid
upon
her
bed
and
recovered
both
sight
and
mind
the
first
act
of
her
intelligence
was
to
send
the
maid
to
her
friend
madame
de
portenduere
sabine
felt
that
her
ideas
were
whirling
in
her
brain
like
straws
at
the
will
of
a
waterspout
i
saw
she
said
later
myriads
all
at
she
rang
for
the
footman
and
in
the
transport
of
her
fever
she
found
strength
to
write
the
following
letter
for
she
was
mastered
by
one
mad
desire
to
have
certainty
to
madame
la
baronne
du
guenic
dear
mamma
when
you
come
to
paris
as
you
allow
us
to
hope
you
will
i
shall
thank
you
in
person
for
the
beautiful
present
by
which
you
and
my
aunt
zephirine
and
calyste
wish
to
reward
me
for
doing
my
duty
i
was
already
well
repaid
by
my
own
happiness
in
doing
it
i
can
never
express
the
pleasure
you
have
given
me
in
that
beautiful
but
when
you
are
with
me
i
shall
try
to
do
so
believe
me
when
i
array
myself
before
that
treasure
i
shall
think
like
the
roman
matron
that
my
noblest
jewel
is
our
little
angel
etc
she
directed
the
letter
to
guerande
and
gave
it
to
the
footman
to
post
when
the
vicomtesse
de
portenduere
came
the
shuddering
chill
of
reaction
had
succeeded
in
poor
sabine
this
first
paroxysm
of
madness
ursula
i
think
i
am
going
to
die
she
said
what
is
the
matter
dear
where
did
savinien
and
calyste
go
after
they
dined
with
you
yesterday
dined
with
me
said
ursula
to
whom
her
husband
had
said
nothing
not
expecting
such
immediate
inquiry
savinien
and
i
dined
alone
together
and
went
to
the
opera
without
ursula
dearest
in
the
name
of
your
love
for
savinien
keep
silence
about
what
you
have
just
said
to
me
and
what
i
shall
now
tell
you
you
alone
shall
know
why
i
die
i
am
betrayed
at
the
end
of
three
years
at
years
of
age
her
teeth
chattered
her
eyes
were
dull
and
frozen
her
face
had
taken
on
the
greenish
tinge
of
an
old
venetian
mirror
you
so
beautiful
for
whom
i
don
t
know
yet
but
calyste
has
told
me
two
lies
do
not
pity
me
do
not
seem
incensed
pretend
ignorance
and
perhaps
you
can
find
out
who
is
through
savinien
oh
that
letter
of
yesterday
trembling
shaking
she
sprang
from
her
bed
to
a
piece
of
furniture
from
which
she
took
the
letter
see
she
said
lying
down
again
the
coronet
of
a
marquise
find
out
if
madame
de
rochefide
has
returned
to
paris
am
i
to
have
a
heart
in
which
to
weep
and
moan
oh
dearest
to
see
one
s
beliefs
one
s
poesy
idol
virtue
happiness
all
all
in
pieces
withered
lost
no
god
in
the
sky
no
love
upon
earth
no
life
in
my
heart
no
anything
i
don
t
know
if
there
s
daylight
i
doubt
the
sun
i
ve
such
anguish
in
my
soul
i
scarcely
feel
the
horrible
sufferings
in
my
body
happily
the
baby
is
weaned
my
milk
would
have
poisoned
at
that
idea
the
tears
began
to
flow
from
sabine
s
eyes
which
had
hitherto
been
dry
pretty
madame
de
portenduere
holding
in
her
hand
the
fatal
letter
the
perfume
of
which
sabine
again
inhaled
was
at
first
stupefied
by
this
true
sorrow
shocked
by
this
agony
of
love
without
as
yet
understanding
it
in
spite
of
sabine
s
incoherent
attempts
to
relate
the
facts
suddenly
ursula
was
illuminated
by
one
of
those
ideas
which
come
to
none
but
sincere
friends
i
must
save
her
she
thought
to
herself
trust
me
sabine
she
cried
wait
for
my
return
i
will
find
out
the
ah
in
my
grave
i
ll
love
you
exclaimed
sabine
the
viscountess
went
straight
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
pledged
her
to
secrecy
and
then
explained
to
her
fully
her
daughter
s
situation
madame
she
said
as
she
ended
do
you
not
think
with
me
that
in
order
to
avoid
some
fatal
illness
perhaps
i
don
t
know
even
madness
we
had
better
confide
the
whole
truth
to
the
doctor
and
invent
some
tale
to
clear
that
hateful
calyste
and
make
him
seem
for
the
time
being
innocent
my
dear
child
said
the
duchess
who
was
chilled
to
the
heart
by
this
confidence
friendship
has
given
you
for
the
moment
the
experience
of
a
woman
of
my
age
i
know
how
sabine
loves
her
husband
you
are
right
she
might
become
or
lose
her
beauty
which
would
be
worse
said
the
viscountess
let
us
go
to
her
cried
the
duchess
fortunately
they
arrived
a
few
moments
before
the
famous
dommanget
the
only
one
of
the
two
men
of
science
whom
calyste
had
been
able
to
find
ursula
has
told
me
everything
said
the
duchess
to
her
daughter
and
you
are
mistaken
in
the
first
place
madame
de
rochefide
is
not
in
paris
as
for
what
your
husband
did
yesterday
my
dear
i
can
tell
you
that
he
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
at
cards
so
that
he
does
not
even
know
how
to
pay
for
your
but
said
sabine
holding
out
to
her
mother
the
fatal
letter
that
said
the
duchess
laughing
why
that
is
written
on
the
jockey
club
paper
everybody
writes
nowadays
on
coroneted
paper
even
our
stewards
will
soon
be
the
prudent
mother
threw
the
unlucky
paper
into
the
fire
as
she
spoke
when
calyste
and
dommanget
arrived
the
duchess
who
had
given
instructions
to
the
servants
was
at
once
informed
she
left
sabine
to
the
care
of
madame
de
portenduere
and
stopped
the
and
calyste
in
the
salon
sabine
s
life
is
at
stake
monsieur
she
said
to
calyste
you
have
betrayed
her
for
madame
de
calyste
blushed
like
a
girl
still
respectable
detected
in
a
fault
and
continued
the
duchess
as
you
do
not
know
how
to
deceive
you
have
behaved
in
such
a
clumsy
manner
that
sabine
has
guessed
the
truth
but
i
have
for
the
present
repaired
your
blunder
you
do
not
wish
the
death
of
my
daughter
i
am
sure
all
this
monsieur
dommanget
will
put
you
on
the
track
of
her
real
illness
and
its
cause
as
for
you
calyste
an
old
woman
like
me
understands
your
error
though
she
does
not
pardon
it
such
pardons
can
only
be
brought
by
a
lifetime
of
after
happiness
if
you
wish
me
to
esteem
you
you
must
in
the
first
place
save
my
daughter
next
you
must
forget
madame
de
rochefide
she
is
only
worth
having
once
learn
to
lie
have
the
courage
of
a
criminal
and
his
impudence
i
have
just
told
a
lie
myself
and
i
shall
have
to
do
hard
penance
for
that
mortal
she
then
told
the
two
men
the
lies
she
had
invented
the
clever
physician
sitting
at
the
bedside
of
his
patient
studied
in
her
symptoms
the
means
of
repairing
the
ill
while
he
ordered
measures
the
success
of
which
depended
on
great
rapidity
of
execution
calyste
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
strove
to
put
into
his
glance
an
expression
of
tenderness
so
it
was
play
which
put
those
black
circles
round
your
eyes
sabine
said
to
him
in
a
feeble
voice
the
words
made
the
doctor
the
mother
and
the
viscountess
tremble
and
they
all
three
looked
at
one
another
covertly
calyste
turned
as
red
as
a
cherry
that
s
what
comes
of
nursing
a
child
said
dommanget
brutally
but
cleverly
husbands
are
lonely
when
separated
from
their
wives
and
they
go
to
the
club
and
play
but
you
needn
t
worry
over
the
thirty
thousand
francs
which
monsieur
le
baron
lost
last
night
thirty
thousand
francs
cried
ursula
in
a
silly
tone
yes
i
know
it
replied
dommanget
they
told
me
this
morning
at
the
house
of
the
young
duchesse
berthe
de
maufrigneuse
that
it
was
monsieur
de
trailles
who
won
that
money
from
you
he
added
turning
to
calyste
why
do
you
play
with
such
men
frankly
monsieur
le
baron
i
can
well
believe
you
are
ashamed
of
seeing
his
a
pious
duchess
the
young
viscountess
a
happy
woman
and
the
old
a
confirmed
egotist
all
three
lying
like
a
dealer
in
the
kind
and
feeling
calyste
understood
the
greatness
of
the
danger
and
two
heavy
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
and
completely
deceived
sabine
monsieur
she
said
sitting
up
in
bed
and
looking
angrily
at
dommanget
monsieur
du
guenic
can
lose
thirty
fifty
a
hundred
thousand
francs
if
it
pleases
him
without
any
one
having
a
right
to
think
it
wrong
or
read
him
a
lesson
it
is
far
better
that
monsieur
de
trailles
should
win
his
money
than
that
we
should
win
monsieur
de
trailles
calyste
rose
took
his
wife
round
the
neck
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
and
whispered
sabine
you
are
an
angel
two
days
later
the
young
wife
was
thought
to
be
out
of
danger
and
the
next
day
calyste
was
at
madame
de
rochefide
s
making
a
merit
of
his
infamy
beatrix
he
said
you
owe
me
happiness
i
have
sacrificed
my
poor
little
wife
to
you
she
has
discovered
all
that
fatal
paper
on
which
you
made
me
write
bore
your
name
and
your
coronet
which
i
never
noticed
i
saw
but
you
fortunately
the
b
was
by
chance
effaced
but
the
perfume
you
left
upon
me
and
the
lies
in
which
i
involved
myself
like
a
fool
have
betrayed
my
happiness
sabine
nearly
died
of
it
her
milk
went
to
the
head
erysipelas
set
in
and
possibly
she
may
bear
the
marks
for
the
rest
of
her
as
beatrix
listened
to
this
tirade
her
face
was
due
north
icy
enough
to
freeze
the
seine
had
she
looked
at
it
so
much
the
better
she
said
perhaps
it
will
whiten
her
for
and
beatrix
now
become
as
hard
as
her
bones
sharp
as
her
voice
harsh
as
her
complexion
continued
a
series
of
atrocious
sarcasms
in
the
same
tone
there
is
no
greater
blunder
than
for
a
man
to
talk
of
his
wife
if
she
is
virtuous
to
his
mistress
unless
it
be
to
talk
of
his
mistress
if
she
is
beautiful
to
his
wife
but
calyste
had
not
received
that
species
of
parisian
education
which
we
must
call
the
politeness
of
the
passions
he
knew
neither
how
to
lie
to
his
wife
nor
how
to
tell
his
mistress
the
truth
two
apprenticeships
a
man
in
his
position
must
make
in
order
to
manage
women
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
employ
all
the
power
of
passion
to
obtain
from
beatrix
a
pardon
which
she
forced
him
to
solicit
for
two
hours
a
pardon
refused
by
an
injured
angel
who
raised
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
that
she
might
not
see
the
guilty
man
and
who
put
forth
reasons
sacred
to
marquises
in
a
voice
quivering
with
tears
which
were
furtively
wiped
with
the
lace
of
her
handkerchief
to
speak
to
me
of
your
wife
on
the
very
day
after
my
fall
she
cried
why
did
you
not
tell
me
she
is
a
pearl
of
virtue
i
know
she
thinks
you
handsome
pure
depravity
i
i
love
your
soul
for
let
me
tell
you
my
friend
you
are
ugly
compared
to
many
shepherds
on
the
campagna
of
rome
etc
such
speeches
may
surprise
the
reader
but
they
were
part
of
a
system
profoundly
meditated
by
beatrix
in
this
her
third
incarnation
for
at
each
passion
a
woman
becomes
another
being
and
advances
one
step
more
into
profligacy
the
only
word
which
properly
renders
the
effect
of
the
experience
given
by
such
adventures
now
the
marquise
de
rochefide
had
sat
in
judgment
on
herself
before
the
mirror
clever
women
are
never
deceived
about
themselves
they
count
their
wrinkles
they
assist
at
the
birth
of
their
crow
they
know
themselves
by
heart
and
even
own
it
by
the
greatness
of
their
efforts
at
preservation
therefore
to
struggle
successfully
against
a
splendid
young
woman
to
carry
away
from
her
six
triumphs
a
week
beatrix
had
recourse
to
the
knowledge
and
the
science
of
courtesans
without
acknowledging
to
herself
the
baseness
of
this
plan
led
away
to
the
employment
of
such
means
by
a
turkish
passion
for
calyste
s
beauty
she
had
resolved
to
make
him
think
himself
unpleasant
ugly
and
to
behave
as
if
she
hated
him
no
system
is
more
fruitful
with
men
of
a
conquering
nature
to
such
natures
the
presence
of
repugnance
to
be
vanquished
is
the
renewal
of
the
triumph
of
the
first
day
on
all
succeeding
days
and
it
is
something
even
better
it
is
flattery
in
the
guise
of
dislike
a
man
then
says
to
himself
i
am
irresistible
or
my
love
is
because
it
conquers
her
if
you
deny
this
principle
divined
by
all
coquettes
and
courtesans
throughout
all
social
zones
you
may
as
well
reject
all
seekers
after
knowledge
all
delvers
into
secrets
repulsed
through
years
in
their
duel
with
hidden
causes
beatrix
added
to
the
use
of
contempt
as
a
moral
piston
a
constant
comparison
of
her
own
poetic
comfortable
home
with
the
hotel
du
guenic
all
deserted
wives
who
abandon
themselves
in
despair
neglect
also
their
surroundings
so
discouraged
are
they
on
this
madame
de
rochefide
counted
and
presently
began
an
underhand
attack
on
the
luxury
of
the
faubourg
which
she
characterized
as
stupid
the
scene
of
reconciliation
in
which
beatrix
made
calyste
swear
and
reswear
hatred
to
the
wife
who
she
said
was
playing
comedy
took
place
in
a
perfect
bower
where
she
played
off
her
graces
amid
ravishing
flowers
and
rare
plants
of
the
costliest
luxury
the
science
of
nothings
the
trifles
of
the
day
she
carried
to
excess
fallen
into
a
mortifying
position
through
conti
s
desertion
beatrix
was
determined
to
have
at
any
rate
the
fame
which
unprincipled
conduct
gives
the
misfortune
of
the
poor
young
wife
a
rich
and
beautiful
grandlieu
should
be
her
pedestal
xx
a
short
treatise
on
certainty
but
not
from
pascal
s
point
of
view
when
a
woman
returns
to
ordinary
life
after
the
nursing
of
her
first
child
she
reappears
in
the
world
embellished
and
charming
this
phase
of
maternity
while
it
rejuvenates
the
women
of
a
certain
age
gives
to
young
women
a
splendor
of
freshness
a
gay
activity
a
of
mere
existence
if
it
is
permissible
to
apply
to
the
body
a
word
which
italy
has
discovered
for
the
mind
in
trying
to
return
to
the
charming
habits
of
the
honeymoon
sabine
discovered
that
her
husband
was
not
the
former
calyste
again
she
observed
him
unhappy
girl
instead
of
resting
securely
in
her
happiness
she
sought
for
the
fatal
perfume
and
smelt
it
this
time
she
no
longer
confided
in
her
friend
nor
in
the
mother
who
had
so
charitably
deceived
her
she
wanted
certainty
and
certainty
made
no
long
tarrying
certainty
is
never
wanting
it
is
like
the
sun
and
presently
shades
are
asked
for
to
keep
it
out
it
is
in
matters
of
the
heart
a
repetition
of
the
fable
of
the
woodman
calling
upon
death
we
soon
ask
certainty
to
leave
us
blind
one
morning
about
two
weeks
after
the
first
crisis
sabine
received
this
terrible
letter
guerande
to
madame
la
baronne
du
guenic
my
dear
daughter
your
aunt
zephirine
and
i
are
lost
in
conjectures
about
the
of
which
you
tell
us
in
your
letter
i
have
written
to
calyste
about
it
and
i
beg
you
to
excuse
our
ignorance
you
can
never
doubt
our
hearts
i
am
sure
we
are
piling
up
riches
for
you
here
thanks
to
the
advice
of
mademoiselle
de
on
the
management
of
your
property
you
will
find
yourself
within
a
few
years
in
possession
of
a
considerable
capital
without
losing
any
of
your
income
your
letter
dear
child
as
dearly
loved
as
if
i
had
borne
you
in
my
bosom
and
fed
you
with
my
milk
surprised
me
by
its
brevity
and
above
all
by
your
silence
about
my
dearest
little
calyste
you
told
me
nothing
of
the
great
calyste
either
but
then
i
know
that
is
happy
etc
sabine
wrote
across
this
letter
these
words
noble
brittany
does
not
always
she
then
laid
the
paper
on
calyste
s
desk
calyste
found
the
letter
and
read
it
seeing
sabine
s
sentence
and
recognizing
her
handwriting
he
flung
the
letter
into
the
fire
determined
to
pretend
that
he
had
never
received
it
sabine
spent
a
whole
week
in
an
agony
the
secrets
of
which
are
known
only
to
angelic
or
solitary
souls
whom
the
wing
of
the
bad
angel
has
never
overshadowed
calyste
s
silence
terrified
her
i
who
ought
to
be
all
gentleness
all
pleasure
to
him
i
have
displeased
him
wounded
him
my
virtue
has
made
itself
hateful
i
have
no
doubt
humiliated
my
idol
she
said
to
herself
these
thoughts
plowed
furrows
in
her
heart
she
wanted
to
ask
pardon
for
her
fault
but
certainty
let
loose
upon
her
other
proofs
grown
bold
and
insolent
beatrix
wrote
to
calyste
at
his
own
home
madame
du
guenic
received
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
her
husband
without
opening
it
but
she
said
to
him
in
a
changed
voice
and
with
death
in
her
soul
my
friend
that
letter
is
from
the
jockey
club
i
recognize
both
the
paper
and
the
calyste
colored
and
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
why
don
t
you
read
it
i
know
what
it
is
the
young
wife
sat
down
no
longer
did
fever
burn
her
she
wept
no
more
but
madness
such
as
in
feeble
beings
gives
birth
to
miracles
of
crime
madness
which
lays
hands
on
arsenic
for
themselves
or
for
their
rivals
possessed
her
at
this
moment
little
calyste
was
brought
in
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
to
dance
him
the
child
just
awakened
sought
the
breast
beneath
the
gown
he
remembers
he
at
any
rate
she
said
in
a
low
voice
calyste
went
to
his
own
room
to
read
his
letter
when
he
was
no
longer
present
the
poor
young
woman
burst
into
tears
and
wept
as
women
weep
when
they
are
all
alone
pain
as
well
as
pleasure
has
its
initiation
the
first
crisis
like
that
in
which
poor
sabine
nearly
succumbed
returns
no
more
than
the
first
fruits
of
other
things
return
it
is
the
first
wedge
struck
in
the
torture
of
the
heart
all
others
are
expected
the
shock
to
the
nerves
is
known
the
capital
of
our
forces
has
been
already
drawn
upon
for
vigorous
resistance
so
sabine
sure
of
her
betrayal
spent
three
hours
with
her
son
in
her
arms
beside
the
fire
in
a
way
that
surprised
herself
when
gasselin
turned
into
a
footman
came
to
say
madame
is
let
monsieur
monsieur
does
not
dine
at
home
madame
la
who
knows
what
torture
there
is
for
a
young
woman
of
in
finding
herself
alone
in
the
great
of
an
old
mansion
served
by
silent
servants
under
circumstances
like
these
order
the
carriage
she
said
suddenly
i
shall
go
to
the
she
dressed
superbly
she
wanted
to
exhibit
herself
alone
and
smiling
like
a
happy
woman
in
the
midst
of
her
remorse
for
the
addition
she
had
made
to
madame
de
rochefide
s
letter
she
had
resolved
to
conquer
to
win
back
calyste
by
loving
kindness
by
the
virtues
of
a
wife
by
the
gentleness
of
the
paschal
lamb
she
wished
also
to
deceive
all
paris
she
loved
loved
as
courtesans
and
as
angels
love
with
pride
with
humility
but
the
opera
chanced
to
be
when
rubini
sang
mio
cor
si
she
rushed
away
music
is
sometimes
mightier
than
actor
or
poet
the
two
most
powerful
of
all
natures
combined
savinien
de
portenduere
accompanied
sabine
to
the
peristyle
and
put
her
in
the
carriage
without
being
able
to
understand
this
sudden
flight
madame
du
guenic
now
entered
a
phase
of
suffering
which
is
peculiar
to
the
aristocracy
envious
poor
and
miserable
beings
when
you
see
on
the
arms
of
such
women
golden
serpents
with
diamond
heads
necklaces
clasped
around
their
necks
say
to
yourselves
that
those
vipers
sting
those
slender
bonds
burn
to
the
quick
through
the
delicate
flesh
all
such
luxury
is
dearly
bought
in
situations
like
that
of
sabine
women
curse
the
pleasures
of
wealth
they
look
no
longer
at
the
gilding
of
their
salons
the
silk
of
the
divans
is
jute
in
their
eyes
exotic
flowers
are
nettles
perfumes
poison
the
choicest
cookery
scrapes
their
throat
like
and
life
becomes
as
bitter
as
the
dead
sea
two
or
three
examples
may
serve
to
show
this
reaction
of
luxury
upon
happiness
so
that
all
those
women
who
have
endured
it
may
behold
their
own
experience
fully
aware
now
of
this
terrible
rivalry
sabine
studied
her
husband
when
he
left
the
house
that
she
might
divine
if
possible
the
future
of
his
day
with
what
restrained
fury
does
a
woman
fling
herself
upon
the
spikes
of
that
savage
martyrdom
what
delirious
joy
if
she
could
think
he
did
not
go
to
the
rue
de
chartres
calyste
returned
and
then
the
study
of
his
forehead
his
hair
his
eyes
his
countenance
his
demeanor
gave
a
horrible
interest
to
mere
nothings
to
observations
pursued
even
to
matters
of
toilet
in
which
a
woman
loses
her
and
dignity
these
fatal
investigations
concealed
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
turn
sour
and
rot
the
delicate
roots
from
which
should
spring
to
bloom
the
azure
flowers
of
sacred
confidence
the
golden
petals
of
the
one
only
love
with
all
the
perfumes
of
memory
one
day
calyste
looked
about
him
discontentedly
he
had
stayed
at
home
sabine
made
herself
caressing
and
humble
gay
and
sparkling
you
are
vexed
with
me
calyste
am
i
not
a
good
wife
what
is
there
here
that
displeases
you
she
asked
these
rooms
are
so
cold
and
bare
he
replied
you
don
t
understand
arranging
tell
me
what
is
ah
she
thought
to
herself
madame
de
rochefide
likes
two
days
later
the
rooms
of
the
hotel
du
guenic
had
assumed
another
aspect
no
one
in
paris
could
flatter
himself
to
have
more
exquisite
flowers
than
those
that
now
adorned
them
some
time
later
calyste
one
evening
after
dinner
complained
of
the
cold
he
twisted
about
in
his
chair
declaring
there
was
a
draught
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
sabine
could
not
at
first
imagine
what
this
new
fancy
signified
she
whose
house
possessed
a
calorifere
which
heated
the
staircases
antechambers
and
passages
at
last
after
three
days
meditation
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
her
rival
probably
sat
surrounded
by
a
screen
to
obtain
the
favorable
to
faded
faces
so
sabine
had
a
screen
but
hers
was
of
glass
and
of
israelitish
splendor
from
what
quarter
will
the
next
storm
come
she
said
to
herself
these
indirect
comparisons
with
his
mistress
were
not
yet
at
an
end
when
calyste
dined
at
home
he
ate
his
dinner
in
a
way
to
drive
sabine
frantic
he
would
motion
to
the
servants
to
take
away
his
plates
after
pecking
at
two
or
three
mouthfuls
wasn
t
it
good
sabine
would
ask
in
despair
at
seeing
all
the
pains
she
had
taken
in
conference
with
her
cook
thrown
away
i
don
t
say
that
my
angel
replied
calyste
without
anger
i
am
not
hungry
that
is
a
woman
consumed
by
a
legitimate
passion
who
struggles
thus
falls
at
last
into
a
fury
of
desire
to
get
the
better
of
her
rival
and
often
goes
too
far
even
in
the
most
secret
regions
of
married
life
so
cruel
burning
and
incessant
a
combat
in
the
obvious
and
as
we
may
call
them
exterior
matters
of
a
household
must
needs
become
more
intense
and
desperate
in
the
things
of
the
heart
sabine
studied
her
attitudes
her
toilets
she
took
heed
about
herself
in
all
the
infinitely
little
trifles
of
love
the
cooking
trouble
lasted
nearly
a
month
sabine
assisted
by
mariotte
and
gasselin
invented
various
little
vaudeville
schemes
to
ascertain
the
dishes
which
madame
de
rochefide
served
to
calyste
gasselin
was
substituted
for
calyste
s
groom
who
had
fallen
conveniently
ill
this
enabled
gasselin
to
consort
with
madame
de
rochefide
s
cook
and
before
long
sabine
gave
calyste
the
same
fare
only
better
but
still
he
made
difficulties
what
is
wanting
now
she
said
oh
nothing
he
answered
looking
round
the
table
for
something
he
did
not
find
ah
exclaimed
sabine
as
she
woke
the
next
morning
calyste
wanted
some
of
those
indian
sauces
they
serve
in
england
in
cruets
madame
de
rochefide
accustoms
him
to
all
sorts
of
she
bought
the
english
cruets
and
the
spiced
sauces
but
it
soon
became
impossible
for
her
to
make
such
discoveries
in
all
the
preparations
invented
by
her
rival
this
period
lasted
some
months
which
is
not
surprising
when
we
remember
the
sort
of
attraction
presented
by
such
a
struggle
it
is
life
and
that
is
preferable
with
its
wounds
and
its
anguish
to
the
gloomy
darkness
of
disgust
to
the
poison
of
contempt
to
the
void
of
abdication
to
that
death
of
the
heart
which
is
called
indifference
but
all
sabine
s
courage
abandoned
her
one
evening
when
she
appeared
in
a
toilet
such
as
women
are
inspired
to
wear
in
the
hope
of
eclipsing
a
rival
and
about
which
calyste
said
laughing
in
spite
of
all
you
can
do
sabine
you
ll
never
be
anything
but
a
handsome
alas
she
said
dropping
on
a
sofa
i
may
never
make
myself
a
blonde
but
i
know
if
this
continues
i
shall
soon
be
years
she
refused
to
go
to
the
opera
as
she
intended
and
chose
to
stay
at
home
the
whole
evening
but
once
alone
she
pulled
the
flowers
from
her
hair
and
stamped
upon
them
she
tore
off
the
gown
and
scarf
and
trampled
them
underfoot
like
a
goat
caught
in
the
tangle
of
its
tether
which
struggles
till
death
comes
then
she
went
to
bed
xxi
the
wickedness
of
a
good
woman
playing
for
these
terrible
stakes
sabine
grew
thin
grief
consumed
her
but
she
never
for
a
moment
forsook
the
role
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
sustained
by
a
sort
of
fever
her
lips
drove
back
into
her
throat
the
bitter
words
that
pain
suggested
she
repressed
the
flashing
of
her
glorious
dark
eyes
and
made
them
soft
even
to
humility
but
her
failing
health
soon
became
noticeable
the
duchess
an
excellent
mother
though
her
piety
was
becoming
more
and
more
portuguese
recognized
a
moral
cause
in
the
physically
weak
condition
in
which
sabine
now
took
satisfaction
she
knew
the
exact
state
of
the
relation
between
beatrix
and
calyste
and
she
took
great
pains
to
draw
her
daughter
to
her
own
house
partly
to
soothe
the
wounds
of
her
heart
but
more
especially
to
drag
her
away
from
the
scene
of
her
martyrdom
sabine
however
maintained
the
deepest
silence
for
a
long
time
about
her
sorrows
fearing
lest
some
one
might
meddle
between
herself
and
calyste
she
declared
herself
happy
at
the
height
of
her
misery
she
recovered
her
pride
and
all
her
virtues
but
at
last
after
some
months
during
which
her
sister
clotilde
and
her
mother
had
caressed
and
petted
her
she
acknowledged
her
grief
confided
her
sorrows
cursed
life
and
declared
that
she
saw
death
coming
with
delirious
joy
she
begged
clotilde
who
was
resolved
to
remain
unmarried
to
be
a
mother
to
her
little
calyste
the
finest
child
that
any
royal
race
could
desire
for
heir
presumptive
one
evening
as
she
sat
with
her
young
sister
athenais
whose
marriage
to
the
vicomte
de
grandlieu
was
to
take
place
at
the
end
of
lent
and
with
clotilde
and
the
duchess
sabine
gave
utterance
to
the
supreme
cries
of
her
heart
s
anguish
excited
by
the
pangs
of
a
last
humiliation
athenais
she
said
when
the
vicomte
juste
de
grandlieu
departed
at
eleven
o
clock
you
are
going
to
marry
let
my
example
be
a
warning
to
you
consider
it
a
crime
to
display
your
best
qualities
resist
the
pleasure
of
adorning
yourself
to
please
juste
be
calm
dignified
cold
measure
the
happiness
you
give
by
that
which
you
receive
this
is
shameful
but
it
is
necessary
look
at
me
i
perish
through
my
best
qualities
all
that
i
was
fine
and
sacred
and
grand
within
me
all
my
virtues
were
rocks
on
which
my
happiness
is
wrecked
i
have
ceased
to
please
because
i
am
not
years
old
in
the
eyes
of
some
men
youth
is
thought
an
inferiority
there
is
nothing
to
imagine
on
an
innocent
face
i
laugh
frankly
and
that
is
wrong
to
captivate
i
ought
to
play
off
the
melancholy
of
the
fallen
angel
who
wants
to
hide
her
yellowing
teeth
a
fresh
complexion
is
monotonous
some
men
prefer
their
doll
s
wax
made
of
rouge
and
spermaceti
and
cold
cream
i
am
straightforward
but
duplicity
is
more
pleasing
i
am
loyally
passionate
as
an
honest
woman
may
be
but
i
ought
to
be
manoeuvring
tricky
hypocritical
and
simulate
a
coldness
i
have
not
like
any
provincial
actress
i
am
intoxicated
with
the
happiness
of
having
married
one
of
the
most
charming
men
in
france
i
tell
him
naively
how
distinguished
he
is
how
graceful
his
movements
are
how
handsome
i
think
him
but
to
please
him
i
ought
to
turn
away
my
head
with
pretended
horror
to
love
nothing
with
real
love
and
tell
him
his
distinction
is
mere
sickliness
i
have
the
misfortune
to
admire
all
beautiful
things
without
setting
myself
up
for
a
wit
by
caustic
and
envious
criticism
of
whatever
shines
from
poesy
and
beauty
i
don
t
seek
to
make
canalis
and
nathan
say
of
in
verse
and
prose
that
my
intellect
is
superior
i
m
only
a
poor
little
artless
child
i
care
only
for
calyste
ah
if
i
had
scoured
the
world
like
if
i
had
said
as
has
said
i
love
in
every
language
of
europe
i
should
be
consoled
i
should
be
pitied
i
should
be
adored
for
serving
the
regal
macedonian
with
cosmopolitan
love
we
are
thanked
for
our
tenderness
if
we
set
it
in
relief
against
our
vice
and
i
a
noble
woman
must
teach
myself
impurity
and
all
the
tricks
of
prostitutes
and
calyste
is
the
dupe
of
such
grimaces
oh
mother
oh
my
dear
clotilde
i
feel
that
i
have
got
my
my
pride
is
only
a
sham
buckler
i
am
without
defence
against
my
misery
i
love
my
husband
madly
and
yet
to
bring
him
back
to
me
i
must
borrow
the
wisdom
of
silly
girl
whispered
clotilde
let
him
think
you
will
avenge
yourself
i
wish
to
die
irreproachable
and
without
the
mere
semblance
of
doing
wrong
replied
sabine
a
woman
s
vengeance
should
be
worthy
of
her
my
child
said
the
duchess
to
her
daughter
a
mother
must
of
course
see
life
more
coolly
than
you
can
see
it
love
is
not
the
end
but
the
means
of
the
family
do
not
imitate
that
poor
baronne
de
macumer
excessive
passion
is
unfruitful
and
deadly
and
remember
god
sends
us
afflictions
with
knowledge
of
our
needs
now
that
athenais
marriage
is
arranged
i
can
give
all
my
thoughts
to
you
in
fact
i
have
already
talked
of
this
delicate
crisis
in
your
life
with
your
father
and
the
duc
de
chaulieu
and
also
with
d
ajuda
we
shall
certainly
find
means
to
bring
calyste
back
to
there
is
always
one
resource
with
the
marquise
de
rochefide
remarked
clotilde
smiling
to
her
sister
she
never
keeps
her
adorers
d
ajuda
my
darling
continued
the
duchess
was
monsieur
de
rochefide
s
if
our
dear
confessor
approves
of
certain
little
manoeuvres
to
which
we
must
have
recourse
to
carry
out
a
plan
which
i
have
proposed
to
your
father
i
can
guarantee
to
you
the
recovery
of
calyste
my
conscience
is
repugnant
to
the
use
of
such
means
and
i
must
first
submit
them
to
the
judgment
of
the
abbe
brossette
we
shall
not
wait
my
child
till
you
are
before
coming
to
your
relief
keep
a
good
heart
your
grief
is
so
bitter
that
my
secret
escapes
me
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
not
to
give
you
a
little
will
it
make
calyste
unhappy
asked
sabine
looking
anxiously
at
the
duchess
oh
heavens
shall
i
ever
be
as
silly
as
that
cried
athenais
naively
ah
little
girl
you
know
nothing
of
the
precipices
down
which
our
virtue
flings
us
when
led
by
love
replied
sabine
making
a
sort
of
moral
revelation
so
distraught
was
she
by
her
woe
the
speech
was
uttered
with
such
incisive
bitterness
that
the
duchess
enlightened
by
the
tone
and
accent
and
look
of
her
daughter
felt
certain
there
was
some
hidden
trouble
my
dears
it
is
midnight
come
go
to
bed
she
said
to
clotilde
and
athenais
whose
eyes
were
shining
in
spite
of
my
years
i
appear
to
be
said
clotilde
laughing
while
athenais
kissed
her
mother
clotilde
leaned
over
sabine
and
said
in
her
ear
you
will
tell
what
it
is
i
ll
dine
with
you
if
my
mother
s
conscience
won
t
let
her
act
i
i
myself
will
get
calyste
out
of
the
hands
of
the
well
sabine
said
the
duchess
taking
her
daughter
into
her
bedroom
tell
me
what
new
trouble
is
there
my
child
mamma
i
am
lost
but
how
i
wanted
to
get
the
better
of
that
horrible
woman
i
conquered
for
a
time
i
am
pregnant
again
and
calyste
loves
her
so
that
i
foresee
a
total
abandonment
when
she
hears
of
it
she
will
be
furious
ah
i
suffer
such
tortures
that
i
can
not
endure
them
long
i
know
when
he
is
going
to
her
i
know
it
by
his
joy
and
his
peevishness
tells
me
as
plainly
when
he
leaves
her
he
no
longer
troubles
himself
to
conceal
his
feelings
i
have
become
intolerable
to
him
she
has
an
influence
over
him
as
unhealthy
as
she
is
herself
in
soul
and
body
you
ll
see
she
will
exact
from
him
as
the
price
of
forgiveness
my
public
desertion
a
rupture
like
her
own
she
will
take
him
away
from
me
to
switzerland
or
italy
he
is
beginning
now
to
say
it
is
ridiculous
that
he
knows
nothing
of
europe
i
can
guess
what
those
words
mean
flung
out
in
advance
if
calyste
is
not
cured
of
her
in
three
months
i
don
t
know
what
he
may
become
but
as
for
me
i
will
kill
but
your
soul
my
unhappy
child
suicide
is
a
mortal
don
t
you
understand
she
may
give
him
a
child
and
if
calyste
loved
the
child
of
that
woman
more
than
mine
oh
that
s
the
end
of
my
patience
and
all
my
she
fell
into
a
chair
she
had
given
vent
to
the
deepest
thought
in
her
heart
she
had
no
longer
a
hidden
grief
and
secret
sorrow
is
like
that
iron
rod
that
sculptors
put
within
the
structure
of
their
clay
it
supports
it
is
a
force
come
go
home
dear
sufferer
in
view
of
such
misery
the
abbe
will
surely
give
me
absolution
for
the
venial
sins
which
the
deceits
of
the
world
compel
us
to
commit
leave
me
now
my
daughter
she
said
going
to
her
i
must
pray
to
our
lord
and
the
blessed
virgin
for
you
with
special
supplication
my
dear
sabine
above
all
things
do
not
neglect
your
religious
duties
if
you
wish
us
to
and
if
we
do
triumph
mother
we
shall
only
save
the
family
calyste
has
killed
within
me
the
holy
fervor
of
love
killed
it
by
sickening
me
with
all
things
what
a
was
mine
in
which
i
was
made
to
feel
on
that
first
day
the
bitterness
of
a
retrospective
adultery
the
next
day
about
two
in
the
afternoon
one
of
the
vicars
of
the
faubourg
appointed
to
a
vacant
bishopric
in
an
office
refused
by
him
for
the
third
time
the
abbe
brossette
one
of
the
most
distinguished
priests
in
paris
crossed
the
of
the
hotel
de
grandlieu
with
a
step
which
we
must
needs
call
the
ecclesiastical
step
so
significant
is
it
of
caution
mystery
calmness
gravity
and
dignity
he
was
a
thin
little
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
with
a
face
as
white
as
that
of
an
old
woman
chilled
by
priestly
austerities
and
hollowed
by
all
the
sufferings
which
he
espoused
two
black
eyes
ardent
with
faith
yet
softened
by
an
expression
more
mysterious
than
mystical
animated
that
truly
apostolical
face
he
was
smiling
as
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
portico
so
little
did
he
believe
in
the
enormity
of
the
cases
about
which
his
penitent
sent
for
him
but
as
the
hand
of
the
duchess
was
an
open
palm
for
charity
she
was
worth
the
time
which
her
innocent
confessions
stole
from
the
more
serious
miseries
of
the
parish
when
the
vicar
was
announced
the
duchess
rose
and
made
a
few
steps
toward
him
in
the
salon
a
distinction
she
granted
only
to
cardinals
bishops
simple
priests
duchesses
older
then
herself
and
persons
of
royal
blood
my
dear
abbe
she
said
pointing
to
a
chair
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
i
need
the
authority
of
your
experience
before
i
throw
myself
into
a
rather
wicked
intrigue
although
it
is
one
which
must
result
in
great
good
and
i
desire
to
know
from
you
whether
i
shall
make
hindrances
to
my
own
salvation
in
the
course
i
propose
to
madame
la
duchesse
replied
the
abbe
do
not
mix
up
spiritual
things
with
worldly
things
they
are
usually
irreconcilable
in
the
first
place
what
is
this
matter
you
know
that
my
daughter
sabine
is
dying
of
grief
monsieur
du
guenic
has
left
her
for
madame
de
it
is
very
dreadful
very
serious
but
you
know
what
our
dear
saint
francois
de
sales
says
on
that
subject
remember
too
how
madame
guyon
complained
of
the
lack
of
mysticism
in
the
proofs
of
conjugal
love
she
would
have
been
very
willing
to
see
her
husband
with
a
madame
de
sabine
is
only
too
gentle
she
is
almost
too
completely
a
christian
wife
but
she
has
not
the
slightest
taste
for
poor
young
woman
said
the
abbe
maliciously
what
method
will
you
take
to
remedy
the
evil
i
have
committed
the
sin
my
dear
director
of
thinking
how
to
launch
upon
madame
de
rochefide
a
little
man
very
and
full
of
the
worst
qualities
who
will
certainly
induce
her
to
dismiss
my
my
daughter
replied
the
abbe
stroking
his
chin
we
are
not
now
in
the
confessional
i
am
not
obliged
to
make
myself
your
judge
from
the
world
s
point
of
view
i
admit
that
the
result
would
be
decisive
the
means
seem
to
me
odious
she
said
why
no
doubt
the
duty
of
a
christian
woman
is
to
withdraw
a
sinning
woman
from
an
evil
path
rather
than
push
her
along
it
but
when
a
woman
has
advanced
upon
that
path
as
far
as
madame
de
rochefide
it
is
not
the
hand
of
man
but
that
of
god
which
recalls
such
a
sinner
she
needs
a
father
replied
the
duchess
i
thank
you
for
your
indulgence
but
the
thought
has
occurred
to
me
that
my
is
brave
and
a
breton
he
was
heroic
at
the
time
of
the
rash
affair
of
that
poor
madame
now
if
the
young
fellow
who
undertook
to
make
madame
de
rochefide
love
him
were
to
quarrel
with
calyste
and
a
duel
should
ensue
you
have
thought
wisely
madame
la
duchesse
and
it
only
proves
that
in
crooked
paths
you
will
always
find
rocks
of
i
have
discovered
a
means
my
dear
abbe
to
do
a
great
good
to
withdraw
madame
de
rochefide
from
the
fatal
path
in
which
she
now
is
to
restore
calyste
to
his
wife
and
possibly
to
save
from
hell
a
poor
distracted
in
that
case
why
consult
me
asked
the
vicar
smiling
ah
replied
the
duchess
because
i
must
permit
myself
some
rather
nasty
actions
you
don
t
mean
to
rob
anybody
on
the
contrary
i
shall
apparently
have
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
you
will
not
calumniate
or
oh
oh
injure
your
neighbor
i
don
t
know
about
come
tell
me
your
plan
said
the
abbe
now
becoming
curious
suppose
instead
of
driving
out
one
nail
by
another
this
is
what
i
thought
at
my
after
imploring
the
blessed
virgin
to
enlighten
me
i
were
to
free
calyste
by
persuading
monsieur
de
rochefide
to
take
back
his
wife
instead
of
lending
a
hand
to
evil
for
the
sake
of
doing
good
to
my
daughter
i
should
do
one
great
good
by
another
almost
as
great
the
vicar
looked
at
the
portuguese
lady
and
was
pensive
that
is
evidently
an
idea
that
came
to
you
from
afar
he
said
so
far
that
i
have
thanked
the
virgin
for
it
replied
the
good
and
humble
duchess
and
i
have
made
a
vow
not
counting
a
novena
to
give
twelve
hundred
francs
to
some
poor
family
if
i
succeed
but
when
i
communicated
my
plan
to
monsieur
de
grandlieu
he
began
to
laugh
and
said
upon
my
honor
at
your
time
of
life
i
think
you
women
have
a
devil
of
your
monsieur
le
duc
made
as
a
husband
the
same
reply
i
was
about
to
make
when
you
interrupted
me
said
the
abbe
who
could
not
restrain
a
smile
ah
father
if
you
approve
of
the
idea
will
you
also
approve
of
the
means
of
execution
it
is
necessary
to
do
to
a
certain
madame
schontz
a
beatrix
of
the
quartier
what
i
proposed
to
do
to
madame
de
i
am
certain
that
you
will
not
do
any
real
wrong
said
the
vicar
cleverly
not
wishing
to
hear
any
more
having
found
the
result
so
desirable
you
can
consult
me
later
if
you
find
your
conscience
muttering
he
added
but
why
instead
of
giving
that
person
in
the
rue
a
fresh
occasion
for
scandal
don
t
you
give
her
a
husband
ah
my
dear
director
now
you
have
rectified
the
only
bad
thing
i
had
in
my
plan
you
are
worthy
of
being
an
archbishop
and
i
hope
i
shall
not
die
till
i
have
had
the
opportunity
of
calling
you
your
i
see
only
one
difficulty
in
all
this
said
the
abbe
what
is
that
suppose
madame
de
rochefide
chooses
to
keep
your
after
she
goes
back
to
her
husband
that
s
my
affair
replied
the
duchess
when
one
doesn
t
often
intrigue
one
does
so
badly
very
badly
said
the
abbe
habit
is
necessary
for
everything
try
to
employ
some
of
those
scamps
who
live
by
intrigue
and
don
t
show
your
own
ah
monsieur
l
abbe
if
i
make
use
of
the
means
of
hell
will
heaven
help
me
you
are
not
at
confession
repeated
the
abbe
save
your
the
worthy
duchess
delighted
with
her
vicar
accompanied
him
to
the
door
of
the
salon
xxii
the
normal
history
of
an
grisette
a
storm
was
gathering
as
we
see
over
monsieur
de
rochefide
who
enjoyed
at
that
moment
the
greatest
amount
of
happiness
that
a
parisian
can
desire
in
being
to
madame
schontz
as
much
a
husband
as
he
had
been
to
beatrix
it
seemed
therefore
as
the
duke
had
very
sensibly
said
to
his
wife
almost
an
impossibility
to
upset
so
agreeable
and
satisfactory
an
existence
this
opinion
will
oblige
us
to
give
certain
details
on
the
life
led
by
monsieur
de
rochefide
after
his
wife
had
placed
him
in
the
position
of
a
the
reader
will
then
be
enabled
to
understand
the
enormous
difference
which
our
laws
and
our
morals
put
between
the
two
sexes
in
the
same
situation
that
which
turns
to
misery
for
the
woman
turns
to
happiness
for
the
man
this
contrast
may
inspire
more
than
one
young
woman
with
the
determination
to
remain
in
her
own
home
and
to
struggle
there
like
sabine
du
guenic
by
practising
as
she
may
select
the
most
aggressive
or
the
most
inoffensive
virtues
some
days
after
beatrix
had
abandoned
him
arthur
de
rochefide
now
an
only
child
in
consequence
of
the
death
of
his
sister
the
first
wife
of
the
marquis
d
who
left
no
children
found
himself
sole
master
of
the
hotel
de
rochefide
rue
d
anjou
and
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
left
to
him
by
his
father
this
rich
inheritance
added
to
the
fortune
which
arthur
possessed
when
he
married
brought
his
income
including
that
from
the
fortune
of
his
wife
to
a
thousand
francs
a
day
to
a
gentleman
endowed
with
a
nature
such
as
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
described
it
in
a
few
words
to
calyste
such
wealth
was
happiness
enough
while
his
wife
continued
in
her
home
and
fulfilled
the
duties
of
maternity
rochefide
enjoyed
this
immense
fortune
but
he
did
not
spend
it
any
more
than
he
expended
the
faculties
of
his
mind
his
good
stout
vanity
gratified
by
the
figure
he
presented
as
a
handsome
man
to
which
he
owed
a
few
successes
that
authorized
him
to
despise
women
allowed
itself
free
scope
in
the
matter
of
brains
gifted
with
the
sort
of
mind
which
we
must
call
a
reflector
he
appropriated
the
sallies
of
others
the
wit
of
the
stage
and
the
by
his
method
of
repeating
them
and
applied
them
as
formulas
of
criticism
his
military
joviality
he
had
served
in
the
royal
guard
seasoned
conversation
with
so
much
point
that
women
without
any
intellects
proclaimed
him
witty
and
the
rest
did
not
dare
to
contradict
them
this
system
arthur
pursued
in
all
things
he
owed
to
nature
the
convenient
genius
of
imitation
without
mimicry
he
imitated
seriously
thus
without
any
taste
of
his
own
he
knew
how
to
be
the
first
to
adopt
and
the
first
to
abandon
a
new
fashion
accused
of
nothing
worse
than
spending
too
much
time
at
his
toilet
and
wearing
a
corset
he
presented
the
type
of
those
persons
who
displease
no
one
by
adopting
incessantly
the
ideas
and
the
follies
of
everbody
and
who
astride
of
circumstance
never
grow
old
as
a
husband
he
was
pitied
people
thought
beatrix
inexcusable
for
deserting
the
best
fellow
on
earth
and
social
jeers
only
touched
the
woman
a
member
of
all
clubs
subscriber
to
all
the
absurdities
generated
by
patriotism
or
party
spirit
a
compliance
which
put
him
in
the
front
rank
of
all
such
matters
this
loyal
brave
and
very
silly
nobleman
whom
unfortunately
so
many
rich
men
resemble
would
naturally
desire
to
distinguish
himself
by
adopting
some
fashionable
mania
consequently
he
glorified
his
name
principally
in
being
the
sultan
of
a
harem
governed
by
an
old
english
groom
which
cost
him
monthly
from
four
to
five
thousand
francs
his
specialty
was
horses
he
protected
the
equine
race
and
supported
a
magazine
devoted
to
hippic
questions
but
for
all
that
he
knew
very
little
of
the
animals
and
from
shoes
to
bridles
he
depended
wholly
on
his
groom
all
of
which
will
sufficiently
explain
to
you
that
this
had
nothing
actually
of
his
own
neither
mind
taste
position
or
absurdity
even
his
fortune
came
from
his
fathers
after
having
tasted
the
displeasures
of
marriage
he
was
so
content
to
find
himself
once
more
a
bachelor
that
he
said
among
his
friends
i
was
born
with
a
caul
that
is
to
good
luck
pleased
above
all
things
to
be
able
to
live
without
the
costs
of
making
an
appearance
to
which
husbands
are
constrained
his
house
in
which
since
the
death
of
his
father
nothing
had
been
changed
resembled
those
of
masters
who
are
travelling
he
lived
there
little
never
dined
and
seldom
slept
there
here
follows
the
reason
for
such
indifference
after
various
amorous
adventures
bored
by
women
of
fashion
of
the
kind
who
are
truly
bores
and
who
plant
too
many
thorny
hedges
around
happiness
he
had
married
after
a
fashion
as
we
shall
see
a
certain
madame
schontz
celebrated
in
the
world
of
fanny
beaupre
susanne
du
florine
mariette
jenny
cadine
etc
this
world
of
which
one
of
our
artists
wittily
remarked
at
the
frantic
moment
of
an
opera
when
one
thinks
that
all
is
lodged
and
clothed
and
lives
well
what
a
fine
idea
it
gives
us
of
mankind
this
world
has
already
irrupted
elsewhere
into
this
history
of
french
manners
and
customs
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
to
paint
it
with
fidelity
the
historian
should
proportion
the
number
of
such
personages
to
the
diverse
endings
of
their
strange
careers
which
terminate
either
in
poverty
under
its
most
hideous
aspect
or
by
premature
death
often
or
by
lucky
marriages
occasionally
by
opulence
madame
schontz
known
at
first
under
the
name
of
la
to
distinguish
her
from
one
of
her
rivals
far
less
clever
than
herself
belongs
to
the
highest
class
of
those
women
whose
social
utility
can
not
be
questioned
by
the
prefect
of
the
seine
nor
by
those
who
are
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
city
of
paris
certainly
the
rat
accused
of
demolishing
fortunes
which
frequently
never
existed
might
better
be
compared
to
a
beaver
without
the
aspasias
of
the
de
lorette
quarter
far
fewer
houses
would
be
built
in
paris
pioneers
in
fresh
stucco
they
have
gone
towed
by
speculation
along
the
heights
of
montmartre
pitching
their
tents
in
those
solitudes
of
carved
the
like
of
which
adorns
the
european
streets
of
amsterdam
milan
stockholm
london
and
moscow
architectural
steppes
where
the
wind
rustles
innumerable
papers
on
which
a
void
is
divulged
by
the
words
to
the
situation
of
these
dames
is
determined
by
that
which
they
take
in
the
apocryphal
regions
if
the
house
is
near
the
line
traced
by
the
rue
de
provence
the
woman
has
an
income
her
budget
prospers
but
if
she
approaches
the
farther
line
of
the
boulevard
exterieur
or
rises
towards
the
horrid
town
of
batignolles
she
is
without
resources
when
monsieur
de
rochefide
first
encountered
madame
schontz
she
lived
on
the
third
floor
of
the
only
house
that
remained
in
the
rue
de
berlin
thus
she
was
camping
on
the
between
misery
and
its
reverse
this
person
was
not
really
named
as
you
may
suppose
either
schontz
or
aurelie
she
concealed
the
name
of
her
father
an
old
soldier
of
the
empire
that
perennial
colonel
who
always
appears
at
the
dawn
of
all
these
feminine
existences
either
as
father
or
seducer
madame
schontz
had
received
the
gratuitous
education
of
where
young
girls
are
admirably
brought
up
but
where
unfortunately
neither
husbands
nor
openings
in
life
are
offered
to
them
when
they
leave
the
school
an
admirable
creation
of
the
emperor
which
now
lacks
but
one
thing
the
emperor
himself
i
shall
be
there
to
provide
for
the
daughters
of
my
faithful
legions
he
replied
to
a
remark
of
one
of
his
ministers
who
foresaw
the
future
napoleon
had
also
said
i
shall
be
there
for
the
members
of
the
institute
to
whom
they
had
better
give
no
salary
than
send
them
eighty
francs
each
month
a
wage
that
is
less
than
that
of
certain
clerks
aurelie
was
really
the
daughter
of
the
intrepid
colonel
schiltz
a
leader
of
those
bold
alsacian
guerillas
who
came
near
saving
the
emperor
in
the
campaign
of
france
he
died
at
metz
robbed
pillaged
ruined
in
napoleon
put
the
little
josephine
schiltz
then
about
nine
years
old
at
having
lost
both
father
and
mother
and
being
without
a
home
and
without
resources
the
poor
child
was
not
dismissed
from
the
institution
on
the
second
return
of
the
bourbons
she
was
of
the
school
till
but
then
her
patience
gave
way
her
beauty
seduced
her
when
she
reached
her
majority
josephine
schiltz
the
empress
s
goddaughter
was
on
the
verge
of
the
adventurous
life
of
a
courtesan
persuaded
to
that
doubtful
future
by
the
fatal
example
of
some
of
her
comrades
like
herself
without
resources
who
congratulated
themselves
on
their
decision
she
substituted
for
in
her
father
s
name
and
placed
herself
under
the
patronage
of
lively
witty
and
she
committed
more
faults
than
her
duller
companions
whose
misdemeanors
had
invariably
for
their
base
after
knowing
various
writers
poor
but
dishonest
clever
but
deeply
in
debt
after
trying
certain
rich
men
as
calculating
as
they
were
foolish
and
after
sacrificing
solid
interests
to
one
true
love
thus
going
through
all
the
schools
in
which
experience
is
taught
on
a
certain
day
of
extreme
misery
when
at
valentino
s
the
first
stage
to
musard
she
danced
in
a
gown
hat
and
mantle
that
were
all
borrowed
she
attracted
the
attention
of
arthur
de
rochefide
who
had
come
there
to
see
the
famous
her
cleverness
instantly
captivated
the
man
who
at
that
time
knew
not
what
passion
to
devote
himself
to
so
that
two
years
after
his
desertion
by
beatrix
the
memory
of
whom
often
humiliated
him
the
marquis
was
not
blamed
by
any
one
for
marrying
so
to
speak
in
the
thirteenth
arrondissement
a
substitute
for
his
wife
let
us
sketch
the
four
periods
of
this
happiness
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
the
theory
of
marriage
in
the
thirteenth
arrondissement
affects
in
like
manner
all
who
come
within
its
rule
marquis
in
the
forties
sexagenary
retired
shopkeeper
quadruple
millionnaire
or
man
great
seigneur
or
bourgeois
the
strategy
of
passion
except
for
the
differences
inherent
in
social
zones
never
varies
the
heart
and
the
are
always
in
the
same
exact
and
clearly
defined
relation
thus
informed
you
will
be
able
to
estimate
the
difficulties
the
duchess
was
certain
to
encounter
in
her
charitable
enterprise
before
there
was
no
arrondissement
in
paris
hence
the
tr
who
knows
the
power
in
france
of
witty
sayings
upon
ordinary
minds
or
what
harm
the
clever
men
who
invent
them
have
done
for
instance
no
could
add
up
the
figures
of
the
sums
remaining
unproductive
and
lost
in
the
depths
of
generous
hearts
and
by
that
ignoble
phrase
une
carotte
the
saying
has
become
so
popular
that
it
must
be
allowed
to
soil
this
page
besides
if
we
penetrate
within
the
arrondissement
we
are
forced
to
accept
its
picturesque
patois
une
has
a
dozen
allied
meanings
but
it
suffices
to
give
it
here
as
monsieur
de
rochefide
like
all
little
minds
was
terribly
afraid
of
being
the
noun
has
become
a
verb
from
the
very
start
of
his
passion
for
madame
schontz
arthur
was
on
his
guard
and
he
was
therefore
very
to
use
another
word
of
the
same
vocabulary
the
word
when
applied
to
a
young
girl
means
the
guest
or
the
one
entertained
but
applied
to
a
man
it
signifies
the
giver
of
the
feast
who
is
niggardly
madame
schontz
had
too
much
sense
and
she
knew
men
too
well
not
to
conceive
great
hopes
from
such
a
beginning
monsieur
de
rochefide
allowed
her
five
hundred
francs
a
month
furnished
for
her
rather
shabbily
an
apartment
costing
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
on
a
second
floor
in
the
rue
coquenard
and
set
himself
to
study
aurelie
s
character
while
she
perceiving
his
object
gave
him
a
character
to
study
consequently
rochefide
became
happy
in
meeting
with
a
woman
of
noble
nature
but
he
saw
nothing
surprising
in
that
her
mother
was
a
barnheim
of
baden
a
woman
besides
aurelie
was
so
well
brought
up
herself
speaking
english
german
and
italian
she
possessed
a
thorough
knowledge
of
foreign
literatures
she
could
hold
her
own
against
all
pianists
and
remark
this
she
behaved
about
her
talents
like
a
woman
she
never
mentioned
them
she
picked
up
a
brush
in
a
painter
s
studio
used
it
half
jestingly
and
produced
a
head
which
caused
general
astonishment
for
mere
amusement
during
the
time
she
pined
as
at
she
had
made
some
advance
in
the
domain
of
the
sciences
but
her
subsequent
life
had
covered
these
good
seeds
with
a
coating
of
salt
and
she
now
gave
arthur
the
credit
of
the
sprouting
of
the
precious
germs
for
him
thus
aurelie
began
by
showing
a
disinterestedness
equal
to
her
other
charms
which
allowed
this
weak
corvette
to
attach
its
grapnels
securely
to
the
larger
vessel
nevertheless
about
the
end
of
the
first
year
she
made
ignoble
noises
in
the
antechamber
with
her
clogs
coming
in
about
the
time
when
the
marquis
was
awaiting
her
and
hiding
as
best
she
could
the
draggled
tail
of
an
outrageously
muddy
gown
in
short
she
had
by
this
time
so
perfectly
persuaded
her
that
all
her
ambition
after
so
many
ups
and
downs
was
to
obtain
honorably
a
comfortable
little
bourgeois
existence
that
about
ten
months
after
their
first
meeting
the
second
phase
of
happiness
declared
itself
madame
schontz
then
obtained
a
fine
apartment
in
the
rue
arthur
who
could
no
longer
conceal
the
amount
of
his
fortune
gave
her
splendid
furniture
a
complete
service
of
plate
twelve
hundred
francs
a
month
a
low
carriage
with
one
horse
this
however
was
hired
but
he
granted
a
tiger
very
graciously
madame
schontz
was
not
the
least
grateful
for
this
munificence
she
knew
the
motive
of
her
arthur
s
conduct
and
recognized
the
calculations
of
the
male
sick
of
living
at
a
restaurant
where
the
fare
is
usually
execrable
and
where
the
least
little
dinner
costs
sixty
francs
for
one
and
two
hundred
francs
if
you
invite
three
friends
rochefide
offered
madame
schontz
forty
francs
a
day
for
his
dinner
and
that
of
a
friend
everything
included
aurelie
accepted
thus
having
made
him
take
up
all
her
moral
letters
of
credit
drawn
one
by
one
on
monsieur
de
rochefide
s
comfort
she
was
listened
to
with
favor
when
she
asked
for
five
hundred
francs
more
a
month
for
her
dress
in
order
not
to
shame
her
whose
friends
all
belonged
to
the
jockey
club
it
would
be
a
pretty
thing
she
said
if
rastignac
maxime
de
trailles
d
esgrignon
la
ronqueroles
laginski
lenoncourt
found
you
with
a
sort
of
madame
everard
besides
have
confidence
in
me
papa
and
you
ll
be
the
in
fact
aurelie
contrived
to
display
new
virtues
in
this
second
phase
she
laid
out
for
herself
a
role
for
which
she
claimed
much
credit
she
made
so
she
said
both
ends
meet
at
the
close
of
the
month
on
two
thousand
five
hundred
francs
without
a
debt
a
thing
unheard
of
in
the
faubourg
of
the
arrondissement
and
she
served
dinners
infinitely
superior
to
those
of
nucingen
at
which
exquisite
wines
were
drunk
at
twelve
francs
a
bottle
rochefide
amazed
and
delighted
to
be
able
to
invite
his
friends
to
the
house
with
economy
declared
as
he
caught
her
round
the
waist
she
s
a
treasure
soon
after
he
hired
of
a
box
at
the
opera
for
her
next
he
took
her
to
first
representations
then
he
began
to
consult
his
aurelie
and
recognized
the
excellence
of
her
advice
she
let
him
take
the
clever
sayings
she
said
about
most
things
for
his
own
and
these
being
unknown
to
others
raised
his
reputation
as
an
amusing
man
he
now
acquired
the
certainty
of
being
loved
truly
and
for
himself
alone
aurelie
refused
to
make
the
happiness
of
a
russian
prince
who
offered
her
five
thousand
francs
a
month
you
are
a
lucky
man
my
dear
marquis
cried
old
prince
galathionne
as
he
finished
his
game
of
whist
at
the
club
yesterday
after
you
left
us
alone
i
tried
to
get
madame
schontz
away
from
you
but
she
said
prince
you
are
not
handsomer
but
you
are
a
great
deal
older
than
rochefide
you
would
beat
me
but
he
is
like
a
father
to
me
can
you
give
me
of
a
reason
why
i
should
change
i
ve
never
had
the
grand
passion
for
arthur
that
i
once
had
for
little
fools
in
varnished
boots
and
whose
debts
i
paid
but
i
love
him
as
a
wife
loves
her
husband
when
she
is
an
honest
and
thereupon
she
showed
me
the
this
speech
which
did
not
seem
exaggerated
had
the
effect
of
greatly
increasing
the
state
of
neglect
and
degradation
which
reigned
in
the
hotel
de
rochefide
arthur
now
transported
his
whole
existence
and
his
pleasures
to
madame
schontz
and
found
himself
well
off
for
at
the
end
of
three
years
he
had
four
hundred
thousand
francs
to
invest
the
third
phase
now
began
madame
schontz
became
the
tenderest
of
mothers
to
arthur
s
son
she
fetched
him
from
school
and
took
him
back
herself
she
overwhelmed
with
presents
and
dainties
and
the
child
who
called
her
his
little
mamma
and
who
adored
her
she
took
part
in
the
management
of
arthur
s
property
she
made
him
buy
into
the
funds
when
low
just
before
the
famous
treaty
of
london
which
overturned
the
ministry
of
march
arthur
gained
two
hundred
thousand
francs
by
that
transaction
and
aurelie
did
not
ask
for
a
penny
of
it
like
the
gentleman
that
he
was
rochefide
invested
his
six
hundred
thousand
francs
in
stock
of
the
bank
of
france
and
put
half
of
that
sum
in
the
name
of
josephine
schiltz
a
little
house
was
now
hired
in
the
rue
de
la
bruyere
and
given
to
grindot
that
great
decorative
architect
with
orders
to
make
it
a
perfect
henceforth
rochefide
no
longer
managed
his
affairs
madame
schontz
received
the
revenues
and
paid
the
bills
become
as
it
were
practically
his
wife
his
woman
of
business
she
justified
the
position
by
making
her
more
comfortable
than
ever
she
had
learned
all
his
fancies
and
gratified
them
as
madame
de
pompadour
gratified
those
of
louis
xv
in
short
madame
schontz
reigned
an
absolute
mistress
she
then
began
to
patronize
a
few
young
men
artists
men
of
letters
to
fame
who
rejected
both
ancients
and
moderns
and
strove
to
make
themselves
a
great
reputation
by
accomplishing
little
or
nothing
the
conduct
of
madame
schontz
a
triumph
of
tactics
ought
to
reveal
to
you
her
superiority
in
the
first
place
these
ten
or
a
dozen
young
fellows
amused
arthur
they
supplied
him
with
witty
sayings
and
clever
opinions
on
all
sorts
of
topics
and
did
not
put
in
doubt
the
fidelity
of
the
mistress
moreover
they
proclaimed
her
a
woman
who
was
eminently
intelligent
these
living
advertisements
these
perambulating
articles
soon
set
up
madame
schontz
as
the
most
agreeable
woman
to
be
found
in
the
borderland
which
separates
the
thirteenth
arrondissement
from
the
twelve
others
her
rivals
suzanne
gaillard
who
in
had
won
the
advantage
over
her
of
becoming
a
wife
married
in
legitimate
marriage
fanny
beaupre
mariette
antonia
spread
calumnies
that
were
more
than
droll
about
the
beauty
of
those
young
men
and
the
complacent
with
which
monsieur
de
rochefide
welcomed
them
madame
schontz
who
could
distance
as
she
said
by
three
the
wit
of
those
ladies
said
to
them
one
night
at
a
supper
given
by
nathan
to
florine
after
recounting
her
fortune
and
her
success
do
as
much
yourselves
a
speech
which
remained
in
their
memory
it
was
during
this
period
that
madame
schontz
made
arthur
sell
his
through
a
series
of
considerations
which
she
no
doubt
derived
from
the
critical
mind
of
claude
vignon
one
of
her
i
can
conceive
she
said
one
night
after
lashing
the
horses
for
some
time
with
her
lively
wit
that
princes
and
rich
men
should
set
their
hearts
on
but
only
for
the
good
of
the
country
not
for
the
paltry
satisfactions
of
a
betting
man
if
you
had
a
stud
farm
on
your
property
and
could
raise
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
horses
and
if
all
the
horses
of
france
and
of
navarre
could
enter
into
one
great
solemn
competition
it
would
be
fine
but
you
buy
animals
as
the
managers
of
theatres
trade
in
artists
you
degrade
an
institution
to
a
gambling
game
you
make
a
bourse
of
legs
as
you
make
a
bourse
of
stocks
it
is
unworthy
don
t
you
spend
sixty
thousand
francs
sometimes
merely
to
read
in
the
newspapers
lelia
belonging
to
monsieur
de
rochefide
beat
by
a
length
the
property
of
monsieur
le
duc
de
rhetore
you
had
much
better
give
that
money
to
poets
who
would
carry
you
in
prose
and
verse
to
immortality
like
the
late
by
dint
of
being
prodded
the
marquis
was
brought
to
see
the
hollowness
of
the
turf
he
realized
that
economy
of
sixty
thousand
francs
and
the
next
year
madame
schontz
remarked
to
him
i
don
t
cost
you
anything
now
many
rich
men
envied
the
marquis
and
endeavored
to
entice
madame
schontz
away
from
him
but
like
the
russian
prince
they
wasted
their
old
age
listen
to
me
she
said
to
finot
now
become
immensely
rich
i
am
certain
that
rochefide
would
forgive
me
a
little
passion
if
i
fell
in
love
with
any
one
but
one
doesn
t
leave
a
marquis
with
a
kind
heart
like
that
for
a
like
you
you
couldn
t
keep
me
in
the
position
in
which
arthur
has
placed
me
he
has
made
me
half
a
wife
and
a
lady
and
that
s
more
than
you
could
do
even
if
you
married
this
was
the
last
nail
which
clinched
the
fetters
of
that
happy
for
the
speech
of
course
reached
the
ears
for
which
it
was
intended
the
fourth
phase
had
begun
that
of
the
final
victory
in
these
plans
of
campaign
which
make
the
women
of
this
class
say
of
a
man
i
hold
him
rochefide
who
had
just
bought
the
little
hotel
in
the
name
of
mademoiselle
josephine
schiltz
a
trifle
of
eighty
thousand
francs
had
reached
at
the
moment
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
was
forming
plans
about
him
the
stage
of
deriving
vanity
from
his
mistress
whom
he
now
called
ninon
ii
by
vaunting
her
scrupulous
honesty
her
excellent
manners
her
education
and
her
wit
he
had
merged
his
own
defects
merits
tastes
and
pleasures
in
madame
schontz
and
he
found
himself
at
this
period
of
his
life
either
from
lassitude
indifference
or
philosophy
a
man
unable
to
change
who
clings
to
wife
or
mistress
we
may
understand
the
position
won
in
five
years
by
madame
schontz
from
the
fact
that
presentation
at
her
house
had
to
be
proposed
some
time
before
it
was
granted
she
refused
to
receive
dull
rich
people
and
smirched
people
and
only
departed
from
this
rule
in
favor
of
certain
great
names
of
the
aristocracy
they
she
said
have
a
right
to
be
stupid
because
they
are
she
possessed
ostensibly
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
which
rochefide
had
given
her
and
which
a
certain
good
fellow
a
broker
named
gobenheim
the
only
man
of
that
class
admitted
to
her
house
invested
and
reinvested
for
her
but
she
manipulated
for
herself
secretly
a
little
fortune
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
the
result
of
her
savings
for
the
last
three
years
and
of
the
constant
movement
of
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
for
she
never
admitted
the
possession
of
more
than
that
known
sum
the
more
you
make
the
less
you
get
rich
said
gobenheim
to
her
one
day
water
is
so
dear
she
answered
this
secret
hoard
was
increased
by
jewels
and
diamonds
which
aurelie
wore
a
month
and
then
sold
when
any
one
called
her
rich
madame
schontz
replied
that
at
the
rate
of
interest
in
the
funds
three
hundred
thousand
francs
produced
only
twelve
thousand
and
she
had
spent
as
much
as
that
in
the
hardest
days
of
her
life
xxiii
one
of
the
diseases
of
the
age
such
conduct
implied
a
plan
and
madame
schontz
had
as
you
may
well
believe
a
plan
jealous
for
the
last
two
years
of
madame
du
bruel
she
was
consumed
with
the
ambition
to
be
married
by
church
and
mayor
all
social
positions
have
their
forbidden
fruit
some
little
thing
magnified
by
desire
until
it
has
become
the
weightiest
thing
in
life
this
ambition
of
course
involved
a
second
arthur
but
no
espial
on
the
part
of
those
about
her
had
as
yet
discovered
rochefide
s
secret
rival
bixiou
fancied
he
saw
the
favored
one
in
leon
de
lora
the
painter
saw
him
in
bixiou
who
had
passed
his
fortieth
year
and
ought
to
be
making
himself
a
fate
of
some
kind
suspicions
were
also
turned
on
victor
de
vernisset
a
poet
of
the
school
of
canalis
whose
passion
for
madame
schontz
was
desperate
but
the
poet
accused
stidmann
a
young
sculptor
of
being
his
fortune
rival
this
artist
a
charming
lad
worked
for
jewellers
for
manufacturers
in
bronze
and
he
longed
to
be
another
benvenuto
cellini
claude
vignon
the
young
comte
de
la
palferine
gobenheim
vermanton
a
cynical
philosopher
all
frequenters
of
this
amusing
salon
were
severally
suspected
and
proved
innocent
no
one
had
fathomed
madame
schontz
certainly
not
rochefide
who
thought
she
had
a
penchant
for
the
young
and
witty
la
palferine
she
was
virtuous
from
and
was
wholly
bent
on
making
a
good
marriage
only
one
man
of
equivocal
reputation
was
ever
seen
in
madame
schontz
s
salon
namely
couture
who
had
more
than
once
made
his
brother
speculators
howl
but
couture
had
been
one
of
madame
schontz
s
earliest
friends
and
she
alone
remained
faithful
to
him
the
false
alarm
of
swept
away
the
last
vestige
of
this
s
credit
aurelie
seeing
his
run
of
made
rochefide
play
as
we
have
seen
in
the
other
direction
thankful
to
find
a
place
for
himself
at
aurelie
s
table
couture
to
whom
finot
the
cleverest
or
if
you
choose
the
luckiest
of
all
parvenus
occasionally
gave
a
note
of
a
thousand
francs
was
alone
wise
and
calculating
enough
to
offer
his
hand
and
name
to
madame
schontz
who
studied
him
to
see
if
the
bold
speculator
had
sufficient
power
to
make
his
way
in
politics
and
enough
gratitude
not
to
desert
his
wife
couture
a
man
about
years
of
age
half
did
not
redeem
the
unpleasant
sonority
of
his
name
by
birth
he
said
little
of
the
authors
of
his
days
madame
schontz
was
bemoaning
to
herself
the
rarity
of
eligible
men
when
couture
presented
to
her
a
provincial
supplied
with
the
two
handles
by
which
women
take
hold
of
such
pitchers
when
they
wish
to
keep
them
to
sketch
this
person
will
be
to
paint
a
portion
of
the
youth
of
the
day
the
digression
is
history
in
fabien
du
ronceret
son
of
a
of
the
royal
court
at
caen
who
had
lately
died
left
his
native
town
of
alencon
resigning
his
judgeship
a
position
in
which
his
father
had
compelled
him
he
said
to
waste
his
time
and
came
to
paris
with
the
intention
of
making
a
noise
there
a
norman
idea
difficult
to
realize
for
he
could
scarcely
scrape
together
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
his
mother
still
being
alive
and
possessing
a
in
a
valuable
estate
in
alencon
this
young
man
had
already
during
previous
visits
to
paris
tried
his
rope
like
an
acrobat
and
had
recognized
the
great
vice
of
the
social
replastering
of
he
meant
to
turn
it
to
his
own
profit
following
the
example
of
the
longest
heads
of
the
bourgeoisie
this
requires
a
rapid
glance
on
one
of
the
effects
of
the
new
order
of
things
modern
equality
unduly
developed
in
our
day
has
necessarily
developed
in
private
life
on
a
line
parallel
with
political
life
the
three
great
divisions
of
the
social
namely
pride
conceit
and
vanity
fools
wish
to
pass
for
wits
wits
want
to
be
thought
men
of
talent
men
of
talent
wish
to
be
treated
as
men
of
genius
as
for
men
of
genius
they
are
more
reasonable
they
consent
to
be
only
demigods
this
tendency
of
the
public
mind
of
these
days
which
in
the
chamber
makes
the
manufacturer
jealous
of
the
statesman
and
the
administrator
jealous
of
the
writer
leads
fools
to
disparage
wits
wits
to
disparage
men
of
talent
men
of
talent
to
disparage
those
who
outstrip
them
by
an
inch
or
two
and
the
demigods
to
threaten
institutions
the
throne
or
whatever
does
not
adore
them
unconditionally
so
soon
as
a
nation
has
in
a
very
unstatesmanlike
spirit
pulled
down
all
recognized
social
superiorities
she
opens
the
sluice
through
which
rushes
a
torrent
of
secondary
ambitions
the
meanest
of
which
resolves
to
lead
she
had
so
democrats
declare
an
evil
in
her
aristocracy
but
a
defined
and
circumscribed
evil
she
exchanges
it
for
a
dozen
armed
and
contending
aristocracies
the
worst
of
all
situations
by
proclaiming
the
equality
of
all
she
has
promulgated
a
declaration
of
the
rights
of
envy
we
inherit
the
saturnalias
of
the
revolution
transferred
to
the
domain
apparently
peaceful
of
the
mind
of
industry
of
politics
it
now
seems
that
reputations
won
by
toil
by
services
rendered
by
talent
are
privileges
granted
at
the
expense
of
the
masses
agrarian
law
will
spread
to
the
field
of
glory
never
in
any
age
have
men
demanded
the
affixing
of
their
names
on
the
nation
s
posters
for
reasons
more
puerile
distinction
is
sought
at
any
price
by
ridicule
by
an
affectation
of
interest
in
the
cause
of
poland
in
penitentiaries
in
the
future
of
liberated
in
all
the
little
scoundrels
above
and
below
twelve
years
and
in
every
other
social
misery
these
diverse
manias
create
fictitious
dignities
presidents
and
secretaries
of
societies
the
number
of
which
is
greater
than
that
of
the
social
questions
they
seek
to
solve
society
on
its
grand
scale
has
been
demolished
to
make
a
million
of
little
ones
in
the
image
of
the
defunct
these
parasitic
organizations
reveal
decomposition
are
they
not
the
swarming
of
maggots
in
the
dead
body
all
these
societies
are
the
daughters
of
one
mother
vanity
it
is
not
thus
that
catholic
charity
or
true
beneficence
proceeds
study
evils
in
wounds
and
cure
them
they
don
t
perorate
in
public
meetings
upon
deadly
ills
for
the
pleasure
of
perorating
fabien
du
ronceret
without
being
a
superior
man
had
divined
by
the
exercise
of
that
greedy
peculiar
to
a
norman
the
gain
he
could
derive
from
this
public
vice
every
epoch
has
its
character
which
clever
men
make
use
of
fabien
s
mind
though
not
clever
was
wholly
bent
on
making
himself
talked
about
my
dear
fellow
a
man
must
make
himself
talked
about
if
he
wants
to
be
anything
he
said
on
parting
from
the
king
of
alencon
a
certain
du
bousquier
a
friend
of
his
father
in
six
months
i
shall
be
better
known
than
you
are
it
was
thus
that
fabien
interpreted
the
spirit
of
his
age
he
did
not
rule
it
he
obeyed
it
he
made
his
debut
in
bohemia
a
region
in
the
moral
topography
of
paris
where
he
was
known
as
the
heir
by
reason
of
certain
premeditated
prodigalities
du
ronceret
had
profited
by
couture
s
follies
for
the
pretty
madame
cadine
for
whom
during
his
ephemeral
opulence
he
had
arranged
a
delightful
apartment
with
a
garden
in
the
rue
blanche
the
norman
who
wanted
his
luxury
bought
couture
s
furniture
and
all
the
improvements
he
was
forced
to
leave
behind
him
a
kiosk
in
the
garden
where
he
smoked
a
gallery
in
rustic
wood
with
india
mattings
and
adorned
with
potteries
through
which
to
reach
the
kiosk
if
it
rained
when
the
heir
was
complimented
on
his
apartment
he
called
it
his
the
provincial
took
care
not
to
say
that
grindot
the
architect
had
bestowed
his
best
capacity
upon
it
as
did
stidmann
on
the
carvings
and
leon
de
lora
on
the
paintings
for
fabien
s
crowning
defect
was
the
vanity
which
condescends
to
lie
for
the
sake
of
magnifying
the
individual
self
the
heir
complimented
these
magnificences
by
a
greenhouse
which
he
built
along
a
wall
with
a
southern
exposure
not
that
he
loved
flowers
but
he
meant
to
attack
through
horticulture
the
public
notice
he
wanted
to
excite
at
the
present
moment
he
had
all
but
attained
his
end
elected
of
some
sort
of
floral
society
presided
over
by
the
duc
de
vissembourg
brother
of
the
prince
de
chiavari
youngest
son
of
the
late
marechal
vernon
he
adorned
his
coat
with
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
on
the
occasion
of
an
exhibition
of
products
the
opening
speech
at
which
delivered
by
him
and
bought
of
lousteau
for
five
hundred
francs
was
boldly
pronounced
to
be
his
own
brew
he
also
made
himself
talked
about
by
a
flower
given
to
him
by
old
blondet
of
alencon
father
of
emile
blondet
which
he
presented
to
the
horticultural
world
as
the
product
of
his
own
greenhouse
but
this
success
was
nothing
the
heir
who
wished
to
be
accepted
as
a
wit
had
formed
a
plan
of
consorting
with
clever
celebrities
and
so
reflecting
their
fame
a
plan
somewhat
hard
to
execute
on
a
basis
of
an
exchequer
limited
to
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
with
this
end
in
view
fabien
du
ronceret
had
addressed
himself
again
and
again
without
success
to
bixiou
stidmann
and
leon
de
lora
asking
them
to
present
him
to
madame
schontz
and
allow
him
to
take
part
in
that
menageria
of
lions
of
all
kinds
failing
in
those
directions
he
applied
to
couture
for
whose
dinners
he
had
so
often
paid
that
the
late
speculator
felt
obliged
to
prove
categorically
to
madame
schontz
that
she
ought
to
acquire
such
an
original
if
it
was
only
to
make
him
one
of
those
elegant
footmen
without
wages
whom
the
mistresses
of
households
employ
to
do
errands
when
servants
are
lacking
in
the
course
of
three
evenings
madame
schontz
read
fabien
like
a
book
and
said
to
herself
if
couture
does
not
suit
me
i
am
certain
of
saddling
that
one
my
future
can
go
on
two
legs
this
queer
fellow
whom
everybody
laughed
at
was
really
the
chosen
one
chosen
however
with
an
intention
which
made
such
preference
insulting
the
choice
escaped
all
public
suspicion
by
its
very
improbability
madame
schontz
intoxicated
fabien
with
smiles
given
secretly
with
little
scenes
played
on
the
threshold
when
she
bade
him
if
monsieur
de
rochefide
stayed
behind
she
often
made
fabien
a
third
with
arthur
in
her
and
at
first
representations
this
she
excused
by
saying
he
had
done
her
such
or
such
a
service
and
she
did
not
know
how
else
to
repay
him
men
have
a
natural
conceit
as
common
to
them
as
to
women
that
of
being
loved
exclusively
now
of
all
flattering
passions
there
is
none
more
prized
than
that
of
a
madame
schontz
for
the
man
she
makes
the
object
of
a
love
she
calls
from
the
heart
in
distinction
from
another
sort
of
love
a
woman
like
madame
schontz
who
plays
the
great
lady
and
whose
intrinsic
value
is
real
was
sure
to
be
an
object
of
pride
to
fabien
who
fell
in
love
with
her
to
the
point
of
never
presenting
himself
before
her
eyes
except
in
full
dress
varnished
boots
gloves
embroidered
shirt
and
frill
waistcoat
more
or
less
variegated
in
short
with
all
the
external
symptoms
of
profound
worship
a
month
before
the
conference
of
the
duchess
and
her
confessor
madame
schontz
had
confided
the
secret
of
her
birth
and
her
real
name
to
fabien
who
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
motive
of
the
confidence
a
fortnight
later
madame
schontz
surprised
at
this
want
of
intelligence
suddenly
exclaimed
to
herself
heavens
how
stupid
i
am
he
expects
me
to
love
him
for
accordingly
the
next
day
she
took
the
heir
in
her
to
the
bois
for
she
now
had
two
little
carriages
drawn
by
two
horses
in
the
course
of
this
public
she
opened
the
question
of
her
future
and
declared
that
she
wished
to
marry
i
have
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
she
said
and
i
admit
to
you
that
if
i
could
find
a
man
full
of
ambition
who
knew
how
to
understand
my
character
i
would
change
my
position
for
do
you
know
what
is
the
dream
of
my
life
to
become
a
true
bourgeoise
enter
an
honorable
family
and
make
my
husband
and
children
truly
the
norman
would
fain
be
distinguished
by
madame
schontz
but
as
for
marrying
her
that
folly
seemed
debatable
to
a
bachelor
of
whom
the
revolution
of
july
had
made
a
judge
seeing
his
hesitation
madame
schontz
made
the
heir
the
butt
of
her
wit
her
jests
and
her
disdain
and
turned
to
couture
within
a
week
the
latter
whom
she
put
upon
the
scent
of
her
fortune
had
offered
his
hand
and
heart
and
future
three
things
of
about
the
same
value
the
manoeuvres
of
madame
schontz
had
reached
this
stage
of
proceeding
when
madame
de
grandlieu
began
her
inquiries
into
the
life
and
habits
of
the
beatrix
of
the
place
xxiv
the
influence
of
social
relations
and
position
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
the
abbe
brossette
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
asked
the
marquis
d
ajuda
to
bring
her
that
king
of
political
the
celebrated
comte
maxime
de
trailles
archduke
of
bohemia
the
youngest
of
young
men
though
he
was
now
fully
fifty
years
of
age
monsieur
d
ajuda
arranged
to
dine
with
maxime
at
the
club
in
the
rue
de
beuane
and
proposed
to
him
after
dinner
to
go
and
play
dummy
whist
with
the
duc
de
grandlieu
who
had
an
attack
of
gout
and
was
all
alone
though
the
of
the
duke
and
the
cousin
of
the
duchess
had
every
right
to
present
him
in
a
salon
where
he
had
never
yet
set
foot
maxime
de
trailles
did
not
deceive
himself
as
to
the
meaning
of
an
invitation
thus
given
he
felt
certain
that
the
duke
or
the
duchess
had
some
need
of
him
club
life
where
men
play
cards
with
other
men
whom
they
do
not
receive
in
their
own
houses
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
most
trifling
signs
of
the
present
age
the
duc
de
grandlieu
did
maxime
the
honor
of
appearing
to
suffer
from
his
gout
after
several
games
of
whist
he
went
to
bed
leaving
his
wife
with
maxime
and
d
ajuda
the
duchess
seconded
by
the
marquis
communicated
her
project
to
monsieur
de
trailles
and
asked
his
assistance
while
ostensibly
asking
only
for
his
advice
maxime
listened
to
the
end
without
committing
himself
and
waited
till
the
duchess
should
ask
for
his
before
replying
madame
i
fully
understand
you
he
then
said
casting
on
her
and
the
marquis
one
of
those
shrewd
penetrating
astute
comprehensive
glances
by
which
such
great
scamps
compromise
their
interlocutors
d
ajuda
will
tell
you
that
if
any
one
in
paris
can
conduct
that
difficult
negotiation
it
is
i
of
course
without
mixing
you
up
in
it
without
its
being
even
known
that
i
have
come
here
this
evening
only
before
anything
is
done
we
must
settle
preliminaries
how
much
are
you
willing
to
sacrifice
all
that
is
very
well
then
madame
la
duchesse
as
the
price
of
my
efforts
you
must
do
me
the
honor
to
receive
in
your
house
and
seriously
protect
madame

married
cried
d

be
married
within
a
fortnight
to
the
heiress
of

rich
but
extremely
bourgeois
family
a
sacrifice
to
opinion
i
imbibe
the
very
spirit
of
my
government
and
start
upon
a
new
career
consequently
madame
la
duchesse
will
understand
how
important
it
is
to
me
to
have
my
wife
adopted
by
her
and
by
her
family
i
am
certain
of
being
made
deputy

the
resignation
of

and
i
am
promised
a
diplomatic
post
in
keeping
with
my
new
fortune
i
do
not
see
why
my

should
not
be
as
well
received
as
madame

in
that
society
of

you
madame

you
are
religious
and
if
you
say
yes
your
promise
which
i
know
to
be
sacred
will
greatly
aid
in
my
change
of

be
one
more
good
action
to
your

solemnly
and

back
upon

i
give
you

ah
madame

visibly
touched
if
monsieur

also
deign
to
treat
me
with
some
kindness
i
promise
you
to
make
your
plan
succeed
without
its
costing
you
very
much
but
he
continued
after
a
pause
you
must
take
upon
yourself
to
follow
my
instructions
this
is
the
last
intrigue
of
my
bachelor
life
it
must
be
all
the
better
managed
because
it
concerns
a
good
action
he
added
smiling

the
duchess
then
i
must
appear

compromise
you
cried

i
esteem
you
too
much
to
demand

i
merely
mean
that
you
must
follow
my
advice
for
example
it
will
be
necessary
that
du
guenic
be
taken
away
by
his
wife
for
at

two
years
she
must
show
him
switzerland
italy
germany
in
short
all
possible
ah
you
confirm
a
fear
of
my
director
said
the
duchess
naively
remembering
the
judicious
objection
of
the
abbe
brossette
maxime
and
d
ajuda
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
at
the
idea
of
this
agreement
between
heaven
and
hell
to
prevent
madame

from
ever
seeing
calyste
again
she
continued
we
will
all
travel

and
his

will
leave

is

said
maxime
i
foresee
enormous
difficulties
though
i
shall
no
doubt
vanquish
them
your
esteem
and
your
protection
are
rewards
which
would
make
me
commit
the
vilest
actions
but
these
will
be
the
vilest
actions
cried
the
duchess
interrupting
this
modern
condottiere
and
showing
on
her
countenance
as
much
disgust
as
amazement
and
you
would
share
them
madame
inasmuch
as
i
am
only
your
agent
but
are
you
ignorant
of
the
degree
of
blindness
to
which
madame
de
rochefide
has
brought
your
i
know
it
from
canalis
and
nathan
between
whom
she
was
hesitating
when
calyste
threw
himself
into
the
lioness
s
jaws
beatrix
has
contrived
to
persuade
that
serious
breton
that
she
has
never
loved
any
one
but
him
that
she
is
virtuous
that
conti
was
merely
a
sentimental
in
which
neither
the
heart
nor
the
rest
of
it
had
any
part
a
musical
love
in
short
as
for
rochefide
that
was
duty
so
you
understand
she
is
virgin
a
fact
she
proves
by
forgetting
her
son
whom
for
more
than
a
year
she
has
not
made
the
slightest
attempt
to
see
the
truth
is
the
little
count
will
soon
be
twelve
years
old
and
he
finds
in
madame
schontz
a
mother
who
is
all
the
more
a
mother
because
maternity
is
as
you
know
a
passion
with
women
of
that
sort
du
guenic
would
let
himself
be
cut
in
pieces
and
would
chop
up
his
wife
for
beatrix
and
you
think
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
drag
a
man
from
the
depths
of
such
credulity
ah
madame
shakespeare
s
iago
would
lose
all
his
handkerchiefs
people
think
that
othello
or
his
younger
brother
orosmanes
or
rene
werther
and
other
lovers
now
in
possession
of
fame
represented
love
never
did
their
fathers
know
what
absolute
love
is
moliere
alone
conceived
it
love
madame
la
duchesse
is
not
loving
a
noble
woman
a
clarissa
a
great
effort
faith
love
is
to
say
to
one
s
self
she
whom
i
love
is
infamous
she
deceives
me
she
will
deceive
me
she
is
an
abandoned
creature
she
smells
of
the
frying
of
but
we
rush
to
her
we
find
there
the
blue
of
heaven
the
flowers
of
paradise
that
is
how
moliere
loved
and
how
we
scamps
that
we
are
how
we
love
as
for
me
i
weep
at
the
great
scene
of
arnolphe
now
that
is
how
your
loves
beatrix
i
shall
have
trouble
separating
rochefide
from
madame
schontz
but
madame
schontz
will
no
doubt
lend
herself
to
the
plot
i
shall
study
her
interior
but
as
for
calyste
and
beatrix
they
will
need
the
blows
of
an
axe
far
deeper
treachery
and
so
base
an
infamy
that
your
virtuous
imagination
could
never
descend
to
it
unless
indeed
your
director
gave
you
a
hand
you
have
asked
the
impossible
you
shall
be
obeyed
but
in
spite
of
my
settled
intention
to
war
with
fire
and
sword
i
can
not
absolutely
promise
you
success
i
have
known
lovers
who
did
not
recoil
before
the
most
awful
disillusions
you
are
too
virtuous
to
know
the
full
power
of
women
who
are
not
do
not
enter
upon
those
infamous
actions
until
i
have
consulted
the
abbe
brossette
to
know
how
far
i
may
be
your
accomplice
cried
the
duchess
with
a
naivete
which
disclosed
what
selfishness
there
is
in
piety
you
shall
be
ignorant
of
everything
my
dear
mother
interposed
d
ajuda
on
the
portico
while
the
carriage
of
the
marquis
was
drawing
up
d
ajuda
said
to
maxime
you
frightened
that
good
but
she
has
no
idea
of
the
difficulty
of
what
she
asks
let
us
go
to
the
jockey
club
rochefide
must
invite
me
to
dine
with
madame
schontz
for
my
plan
will
be
made
and
i
shall
have
chosen
the
pawns
on
my
to
carry
it
out
in
the
days
of
her
splendor
beatrix
refused
to
receive
me
i
intend
to
pay
off
that
score
and
i
will
avenge
your
so
cruelly
that
perhaps
she
will
find
herself
too
well
the
next
day
rochefide
told
madame
schontz
that
maxime
de
trailles
was
coming
to
dinner
that
meant
notifying
her
to
display
all
her
luxury
and
prepare
the
choicest
food
for
this
connoisseur
emeritus
whom
all
the
women
of
the
madame
schontz
type
were
in
awe
of
madame
schontz
herself
thought
as
much
of
her
toilet
as
of
putting
her
house
in
a
state
to
receive
this
personage
in
paris
there
are
as
many
royalties
as
there
are
varieties
of
art
mental
and
moral
specialties
sciences
professions
the
strongest
and
most
capable
of
the
men
who
practise
them
has
a
majesty
which
is
all
his
own
he
is
appreciated
respected
by
his
peers
who
know
the
difficulties
of
his
art
or
profession
and
whose
admiration
is
given
to
the
man
who
surmounts
them
maxime
was
in
the
eyes
of
and
courtesans
an
extremely
powerful
and
capable
man
who
had
known
how
to
make
himself
excessively
loved
he
was
also
admired
by
men
who
knew
how
difficult
it
is
to
live
in
paris
on
good
terms
with
creditors
in
short
he
had
never
had
any
other
rival
in
elegance
deportment
and
wit
than
the
illustrious
de
marsay
who
frequently
employed
him
on
political
missions
all
this
will
suffice
to
explain
his
interview
with
the
duchess
his
prestige
with
madame
schontz
and
the
authority
of
his
words
in
a
conference
which
he
intended
to
have
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
with
a
young
man
already
though
lately
arrived
in
the
bohemia
of
paris
xxv
a
prince
of
bohemia
the
next
day
when
maxime
de
trailles
rose
finot
whom
he
had
summoned
the
night
before
was
announced
maxime
requested
his
visitor
to
arrange
as
if
by
accident
a
breakfast
at
the
cafe
anglais
where
finot
couture
and
lousteau
should
gossip
beside
him
finot
whose
position
toward
the
comte
de
trailles
was
that
of
a
before
a
marshall
of
france
could
refuse
him
nothing
it
was
altogether
too
dangerous
to
annoy
that
lion
consequently
when
maxime
came
to
the
breakfast
he
found
finot
and
his
two
friends
at
table
and
the
conversation
already
started
on
madame
schontz
about
whom
couture
well
manoeuvred
by
finot
and
lousteau
lousteau
being
though
not
aware
of
it
finot
s
tool
revealed
to
the
comte
de
trailles
all
that
he
wanted
to
know
about
her
about
one
o
clock
maxime
was
chewing
a
toothpick
and
talking
with
du
tillet
on
tortoni
s
portico
where
speculation
held
a
little
bourse
a
sort
of
prelude
to
the
great
one
he
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
business
but
he
was
really
awaiting
the
comte
de
la
palferine
who
within
a
given
time
was
certain
to
pass
that
way
the
boulevard
des
italiens
is
what
the
pont
neuf
was
in
all
persons
known
to
fame
pass
along
it
once
at
least
in
the
course
of
the
day
accordingly
at
the
end
of
about
ten
minutes
maxime
dropped
du
tillet
s
arm
and
nodding
to
the
young
prince
of
bohemia
said
smiling
one
word
with
you
the
two
rivals
in
their
own
principality
the
one
orb
on
its
decline
the
other
like
the
rising
sun
sat
down
upon
four
chairs
before
the
cafe
de
paris
maxime
took
care
to
place
a
certain
distance
between
himself
and
some
old
fellows
who
habitually
sunned
themselves
like
at
that
hour
in
the
afternoon
to
dry
out
their
rheumatic
affections
he
had
excellent
reasons
for
distrusting
old
men
have
you
debts
said
maxime
to
the
young
count
if
i
had
none
should
i
be
worthy
of
being
your
successor
replied
la
palferine
in
putting
that
question
to
you
i
don
t
place
the
matter
in
doubt
i
only
want
to
know
if
the
total
is
reasonable
if
it
goes
to
the
five
or
the
six
six
what
figures
whether
you
owe
fifty
or
one
hundred
thousand
i
have
owed
myself
as
much
as
six
hundred
la
palferine
raised
his
hat
with
an
air
as
respectful
as
it
was
humorous
if
i
had
sufficient
credit
to
borrow
a
hundred
thousand
francs
he
replied
i
should
forget
my
creditors
and
go
and
pass
my
life
in
venice
amid
masterpieces
of
painting
and
pretty
women
and
and
at
my
age
what
would
you
be
asked
maxime
i
should
never
reach
it
replied
the
young
count
maxime
returned
the
civility
of
his
rival
and
touched
his
hat
lightly
with
an
air
of
laughable
gravity
that
s
one
way
of
looking
at
life
he
replied
in
the
tone
of
one
connoisseur
to
another
you
owe
oh
a
mere
trifle
unworthy
of
being
confessed
to
an
uncle
he
would
disinherit
me
for
such
a
paltry
sum
six
one
is
often
more
hampered
by
six
thousand
than
by
a
hundred
thousand
said
maxime
sententiously
la
palferine
you
ve
a
bold
spirit
and
you
have
even
more
spirit
than
boldness
you
can
go
far
and
make
yourself
a
position
let
me
tell
you
that
of
all
those
who
have
rushed
into
the
career
at
the
close
of
which
i
now
am
and
who
have
tried
to
oppose
me
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
ever
pleased
la
palferine
colored
so
flattered
was
he
by
this
avowal
made
with
gracious
by
the
leader
of
parisian
adventurers
this
action
of
his
own
vanity
was
however
a
recognition
of
inferiority
which
wounded
him
but
maxime
divined
that
unpleasant
reaction
easy
to
foresee
in
so
clever
a
mind
and
he
applied
a
balm
instantly
by
putting
himself
at
the
discretion
of
the
young
man
will
you
do
something
for
me
that
will
facilitate
my
retreat
from
the
olympic
circus
by
a
fine
marriage
i
will
do
as
much
for
you
make
me
very
proud
it
realizes
the
fable
of
the
rat
and
the
lion
said
la
palferine
i
shall
begin
by
lending
you
twenty
thousand
francs
continued
maxime
twenty
thousand
francs
i
knew
very
well
that
by
dint
of
walking
up
and
down
this
boulevard
said
la
palferine
in
the
style
of
a
parenthesis
my
dear
fellow
you
must
put
yourself
on
a
certain
footing
said
maxime
laughing
don
t
go
on
your
own
two
feet

six
do
as
i
do
i
never
get
out
of
my
but
you
must
be
going
to
ask
me
for
something
beyond
my
no
it
is
only
to
make
a
woman
love
you
within
a
is
it
a
lorette
why
because
that
s
impossible
but
if
it
concerns
a
woman
and
a
one
who
is
also
clever
she
is
a
very
illustrious
you
want
her
letters
said
the
young
count
ah
you
are
after
my
own
heart
cried
maxime
no
that
s
not
then
you
want
me
to
love
her
yes
in
the
real
sense
if
i
am
to
abandon
the
aesthetic
it
is
utterly
impossible
said
la
palferine
i
have
don
t
you
see
as
to
women
a
certain
honor
we
may
play
the
fool
with
them
but
not
ah
i
was
not
mistaken
cried
maxime
do
you
think
i

a
man
to
propose
mere
twopenny
infamies
to
you
no
you
must
go
and
dazzle
and
conquer
my
good
mate
i
give
you
twenty
thousand
francs
and
ten
days
in
which
to
triumph

good

maxime
later
when
you

he
added
in
the
tone
of
a
king
who
binds
himself
but
promises
nothing
this
poor
woman
must
have
done
you
some
deadly
harm
said

try
to
throw
a
into

waters

boy
and
let
me
tell
you
that
in

of
success
you
will
obtain
such
powerful
influence
that
you

able

to
retire
upon

all

was
buttoned
with
opals
and
her
hair
in
bands
as
smooth
and
shining
as

madame
schontz
owed
her
celebrity
as
a
pretty
woman
to
the
brilliancy
and
freshness
of
a
complexion
as
white
and
warm
as
that
of
creoles
to
a
face
full
of
spirited
details
the
features
of
which
were
clearly

firmly
drawn
a
type
long
presented
in
perennial
youth
by
the
comtesse
merlin
and
which
is
perhaps
peculiar
to
southern
races
unhappily
little
madame

had
tended
towards
ebonpoint
ever
since
her
life
had
become
so
happy
and
calm
her
neck
of
exquisite
roundness
was
beginning
to
take
on
flesh
about
the
shoulders
but
in
france
the
heads
of
women
are
principally
treasured
so
that
fine
heads
will
often
keep
an
body
unobserved
my

coming
in

kissing
madame

rochefide

well

him
i
am
not
a

said
madame

with
a
sort
of
dignity
i
hope
to
end
as
they
say
on
the
stage
as
the
progenitrix
of
honest
it
is
dreadful
but
we
are
all
marrying
returned
maxime
throwing
himself
into
an
beside
the
fire
here
am
i
on
the
point
of
making
a
comtesse
oh
how
i
should
like
to
see
her
exclaimed
madame
schontz
but
permit
me
to
present
to
you
monsieur
claude
vignon
monsieur
claude
vignon
monsieur
de
ah
so
you
are
the
man
who
allowed
camille
maupin
the
innkeeper
of
literature
to
go
into
a
convent
cried
maxime
after
you
god
i
never
received
such
an
honor
mademoiselle
des
touches
treated
you
monsieur
as
though
you
were
louis
that
is
how
history
is
written
replied
claude
vignon
don
t
you
know
that
her
fortune
was
used
to
free
the
baron
du
guenic
s
estates
ah
if
she
only
knew
that
calyste
now
belongs
to
her
maxime
pushed
the
critic
s
foot
motioning
to
rochefide
she
would
issue
from
her
convent
i
do
believe
to
tear
him
from
upon
my
word
rochefide
if
i
were
you
said
maxime
finding
that
his
warning
did
not
stop
vignon
i
should
give
back
my
wife
s
fortune
so
that
the
world
couldn
t
say
she
attached
herself
to
calyste
from
maxime
is
right
remarked
madame
schontz
looking
at
arthur
who
colored
high
if
i
have
helped
you
to
gain
several
thousand
francs
a
year
you
couldn
t
better
employ
them
i
shall
have
made
the
happiness
of
husband
wife
what
a
feather
in
my
cap
i
never
thought
of
it
replied
the
marquis
but
a
man
should
be
a
gentleman
before
he
s
a
let
me
tell
you
when
is
the
time
to
be
generous
said
maxime
arthur
said
aurelie
maxime
is
right
don
t
you
see
old
fellow
that
generous
actions
are
like
couture
s
investments
you
should
make
them
in
the
nick
of
at
that
moment
couture
followed
by
finot
came
in
and
soon
after
all
the
guests
were
assembled
in
the
beautiful
blue
and
gold
salon
of
the
hotel
schontz
a
title
which
the
various
artists
had
given
to
their
inn
after
rochefide
purchased
it
for
his
ninon
ii
when
maxime
saw
la
palferine
the
last
to
arrive
enter
he
walked
up
to
his
lieutenant
and
taking
him
aside
into
the
recess
of
a
window
gave
him
notes
for
twenty
thousand
francs
remember
my
boy
you
needn
t
economize
them
he
said
with
the
particular
grace
of
a
true
scamp
there
s
none
but
you
who
can
double
the
value
of
what
you
seem
to
give
replied
la
palferine
have
you
decided
surely
inasmuch
as
i
take
the
money
said
the
count
with
a
mixture
of
haughtiness
and
jest
well
then
nathan
who
is
here
will
present
you
two
days
hence
at
the
house
of
madame
la
marquise
de
la
palferine
started
when
he
heard
the
name
you
are
to
be
madly
in
love
with
her
and
not
to
rouse
suspicion
drink
heavily
wines
liqueurs
i
ll
tell
aurelie
to
place
you
beside
nathan
at
dinner
one
thing
more
my
boy
you
and
i
must
meet
every
night
on
the
boulevard
de
la
madeleine
at
one
in
the
morning
you
to
give
me
an
account
of
progress
i
to
give
you
i
shall
be
there
my
master
said
the
young
count
bowing
why
do
you
make
us
dine
with
that
queer
fellow
dressed
like
the
of
a
restaurant
whispered
maxime
to
madame
schontz
with
a
sign
toward
fabien
du
ronceret
have
you
never
met
the
heir
du
ronceret
of
monsieur
said
maxime
to
fabien
i
think
you
must
know
my
friend
d
esgrignon
victurnien
has
ceased
to
know
me
for
some
time
replied
fabien
but
we
used
to
be
very
intimate
in
our
the
dinner
was
one
of
those
which
are
given
nowhere
but
in
paris
by
these
great
female
spendthrifts
for
the
choiceness
of
their
preparations
often
surprise
the
most
fastidious
of
guests
it
was
at
just
such
a
supper
at
the
house
of
a
courtesan
as
handsome
and
rich
as
madame
schontz
that
paganini
declared
he
had
never
eaten
such
fare
at
the
table
of
any
sovereign
nor
drunk
such
wines
with
any
prince
nor
heard
such
witty
conversation
nor
seen
the
glitter
of
such
coquettish
luxury
maxime
and
madame
schontz
were
the
first
to
the
salon
about
ten
o
clock
leaving
the
other
guests
who
had
ceased
to
tell
anecdotes
and
were
now
boasting
of
their
various
good
qualities
with
their
viscous
lips
glued
to
the
glasses
which
they
could
not
drain
well
my
dear
said
maxime
you
are
not
mistaken
yes
i
have
come
for
your
and
for
help
in
a
great
affair
you
must
leave
arthur
but
i
pledge
myself
to
make
him
give
you
two
hundred
thousand
why
should
i
leave
the
poor
fellow
to
marry
that
idiot
who
seems
to
have
been
sent
from
alencon
expressly
for
the
purpose
he
has
been
a
judge
and
i
ll
have
him
made
in
place
of
emile
blondet
s
father
who
is
getting
to
be
eighty
years
old
now
if
you
know
how
to
sail
your
boat
your
husband
can
be
elected
deputy
you
will
both
be
personages
and
you
can
then
look
down
on
madame
la
comtesse
du
never
said
madame
schontz
she
s
a
hasn
t
he
condition
enough
to
be
made
a
count
by
the
bye
he
bears
arms
cried
aurelie
hunting
for
a
letter
in
an
elegant
bag
hanging
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
and
giving
it
to
maxime
what
do
they
mean
here
are
he
bears
per
fesse
argent
and
azure
on
the
first
three
combs
gules
two
and
one
crossed
by
three
bunches
grapes
purpure
leaved
vert
one
and
two
on
the
second
four
feathers
or
placed
fretwise
with
for
motto
and
a
squire
s
helmet
it
is
not
much
it
seems
they
were
ennobled
under
louis
xiv
some
mercer
was
doubtless
their
grandfather
and
the
maternal
line
must
have
made
its
money
in
wines
the
du
ronceret
whom
the
king
ennobled
was
probably
an
usher
but
if
you
get
rid
of
arthur
and
marry
du
ronceret
i
promise
you
he
shall
be
a
baron
at
the
very
least
but
you
see
my
dear
you
ll
have
to
soak
yourself
for
five
or
six
years
in
the
provinces
if
you
want
to
bury
la
schontz
in
a
baroness
that
queer
creature
has
been
casting
looks
at
you
the
meaning
of
which
is
perfectly
clear
you
ve
got
no
replied
aurelie
when
my
hand
was
offered
to
him
he
remained
like
the
brandies
i
read
of
in
the
market
reports
i
will
undertake
to
decide
him
if
he
is
drunk
go
and
see
where
they
all
it
is
not
worth
while
to
go
i
hear
no
one
but
bixiou
who
is
making
jokes
to
which
nobody
listens
but
i
know
my
arthur
he
feels
bound
to
be
polite
and
he
is
probably
looking
at
bixiou
with
his
eyes
let
us
go
back
ca
said
madame
schontz
suddenly
stopping
short
in
whose
interest
shall
i
be
working
in
that
of
madame
de
rochefide
replied
maxime
promptly
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
her
with
rochefide
as
long
as
you
hold
him
her
object
is
to
recover
her
place
as
head
of
his
household
and
the
enjoyment
of
four
hundred
thousand
francs
a
and
she
offers
me
only
two
hundred
thousand
i
want
three
hundred
thousand
since
the
affair
concerns
her
what
haven
t
i
taken
care
of
her
brat
and
her
husband
i
have
filled
her
place
in
every
way
and
does
she
think
to
bargain
with
me
with
that
my
dear
maxime
i
shall
have
a
million
and
if
you
ll
promise
me
the
at
alencon
i
can
hold
my
own
as
madame
du
that
s
settled
said
maxime
oh
won
t
it
be
dull
to
live
in
that
little
town
cried
aurelie
philosophically
i
have
heard
so
much
of
that
province
from
d
esgrignon
and
the
that
i
seem
to
have
lived
there
suppose
i
promise
you
the
support
of
the
nobility
ah
maxime
you
don
t
mean
that
but
the
pigeon
won
t
and
he
is
very
ugly
with
his
purple
skin
and
bristles
for
whiskers
he
looks
like
a
wild
boar
with
the
eyes
of
a
bird
of
prey
but
he
ll
make
the
finest
of
a
provincial
court
now
don
t
be
uneasy
in
ten
minutes
he
shall
be
singing
to
you
isabelle
s
air
in
the
fourth
act
of
robert
le
diable
at
thy
feet
i
kneel
you
promise
don
t
you
to
send
arthur
back
to
beatrix
it
will
be
difficult
but
perseverance
about
ten
o
clock
the
guests
returned
to
the
salon
for
coffee
under
the
circumstances
in
which
madame
schontz
couture
and
du
ronceret
were
placed
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
effect
produced
upon
the
heir
by
the
following
conversation
which
maxime
held
with
couture
in
a
corner
and
in
a
low
voice
but
so
placed
that
fabien
could
listen
to
them
my
dear
couture
if
you
want
to
lead
a
steady
life
you
had
better
accept
a
which
madame
de
rochefide
will
obtain
for
you
aurelie
s
million
will
furnish
the
security
and
you
ll
share
the
property
in
marrying
her
you
can
be
made
deputy
if
you
know
how
to
trim
your
sails
and
the
premium
i
want
for
thus
saving
you
is
your
vote
in
the
i
shall
always
be
proud
to
be
a
follower
of
ah
my
dear
fellow
you
have
had
quite
an
escape
just
imagine
aurelie
took
a
fancy
for
that
norman
from
alencon
she
asked
to
have
him
made
a
baron
and
in
his
native
town
and
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
fool
never
guessed
her
value
and
you
will
owe
your
fortune
to
her
disappointment
you
had
better
not
leave
that
clever
creature
time
for
reflection
as
for
me
i
am
already
putting
the
irons
in
the
and
maxime
left
couture
at
the
summit
of
happiness
saying
to
la
palferine
shall
i
drive
you
home
my
boy
by
eleven
o
clock
aurelie
was
alone
with
couture
fabien
and
rochefide
arthur
was
asleep
on
a
sofa
couture
and
fabien
each
tried
to
outstay
the
other
without
success
and
madame
schontz
finally
terminated
the
struggle
by
saying
to
couture
i
shall
see
you
a
dismissal
which
he
took
in
good
part
mademoiselle
said
fabien
in
a
low
voice
because
you
saw
me
thoughtful
at
the
offer
which
you
indirectly
made
to
me
do
not
think
there
was
the
slightest
hesitation
on
my
part
but
you
do
not
know
my
mother
she
would
never
consent
to
my
you
have
reached
an
age
for
respectful
summons
retorted
aurelie
insolently
but
if
you
are
afraid
of
mamma
you
won
t
do
for
josephine
said
the
heir
tenderly
passing
his
arm
audaciously
round
madame
schontz
waist
i
thought
you
loved
me
well
perhaps
i
could
appease
my
mother
and
obtain
her
how
if
you
would
employ
your
influence
to
have
you
made
baron
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
at
alencon
is
that
it
my
friend
listen
to
me
i
have
done
so
many
things
in
my
life
that
i
am
capable
of
virtue
i
can
be
an
honest
woman
and
a
loyal
wife
and
i
can
push
my
husband
very
high
but
i
wish
to
be
loved
by
him
without
one
look
or
one
thought
being
turned
away
from
me
does
that
suit
you
don
t
bind
yourself
imprudently
it
concerns
your
whole
life
my
little
with
a
woman
like
you
i
can
do
it
blind
cried
fabien
intoxicated
by
the
glance
she
gave
him
as
much
as
by
the
liqueurs
des
iles
you
shall
never
repent
that
word
my
dear
you
shall
be
peer
of
france
as
for
that
poor
old
fellow
she
continued
looking
at
rochefide
who
was
sound
asleep
after
i
have
with
fabien
caught
madame
schontz
around
the
waist
and
kissed
her
with
an
impulse
of
fury
and
joy
in
which
the
double
intoxication
of
wine
and
love
was
secondary
to
ambition
remember
my
dear
child
she
said
the
respect
you
ought
to
show
to
your
wife
don
t
play
the
lover
leave
me
free
to
retire
from
my
in
a
proper
manner
poor
couture
who
thought
himself
sure
of
wealth
and
a
i
have
a
horror
of
that
man
said
fabien
i
wish
i
might
never
see
him
i
will
not
receive
him
any
more
replied
madame
schontz
with
a
prudish
little
air
now
that
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
my
fabien
you
must
go
it
is
one
o
this
little
scene
gave
birth
in
the
household
of
arthur
and
aurelie
so
completely
happy
until
now
to
a
phase
of
domestic
warfare
produced
in
the
bosom
of
all
homes
by
some
secret
and
alien
interest
in
one
of
the
partners
the
next
day
when
arthur
awoke
he
found
madame
schontz
as
frigid
as
that
class
of
woman
knows
how
to
make
herself
what
happened
last
night
he
said
as
he
breakfasted
looking
at
aurelie
what
often
happens
in
paris
she
replied
one
goes
to
bed
in
damp
weather
and
the
next
morning
the
pavements
are
dry
and
frozen
so
hard
that
they
are
dusty
do
you
want
a
brush
what
s
the
matter
with
you
dearest
go
and
find
your
great
scarecrow
of
a
wife
my
wife
exclaimed
the
poor
marquis
don
t
i
know
why
you
brought
maxime
here
you
mean
to
make
up
with
madame
de
rochefide
who
wants
you
perhaps
for
some
indiscreet
brat
and
i
whom
you
call
so
clever
i
advised
you
to
give
back
her
fortune
oh
i
see
your
scheme
at
the
end
of
five
years
monsieur
is
tired
of
me
i
m
getting
fat
beatrix
is
all
bones
it
will
be
a
change
for
you
you
are
not
the
first
i
ve
known
to
like
skeletons
your
beatrix
knows
how
to
dress
herself
that
s
true
and
you
are
man
who
likes
besides
you
want
to
send
monsieur
du
guenic
to
the
it
will
be
a
triumph
you
ll
cut
quite
an
appearance
in
the
world
how
people
will
talk
of
it
why
you
ll
be
a
hero
madame
schontz
did
not
make
an
end
of
her
sarcasms
for
two
hours
after
in
spite
of
arthur
s
protestations
she
then
said
she
was
invited
out
to
dinner
and
advised
her
faithless
one
to
go
without
her
to
the
opera
for
she
herself
was
going
to
the
to
meet
madame
de
la
baudraye
a
charming
woman
a
friend
of
lousteau
arthur
proposed
as
proof
of
his
eternal
attachment
to
his
little
aurelie
and
his
detestation
of
his
wife
to
start
the
next
day
for
italy
and
live
as
a
married
couple
in
rome
naples
florence
in
short
wherever
she
liked
offering
her
a
gift
of
sixty
thousand
francs
all
that
is
nonsense
she
said
it
won
t
prevent
you
from
making
up
with
your
wife
and
you
ll
do
a
wise
arthur
and
aurelie
parted
on
this
formidable
dialogue
he
to
play
cards
and
dine
at
the
club
she
to
dress
and
spend
the
evening
with
fabien
monsieur
de
rochefide
found
maxime
at
the
club
and
complained
to
him
like
a
man
who
feels
that
his
happiness
is
being
torn
from
his
heart
by
the
roots
every
fibre
of
which
clung
to
it
maxime
listened
to
his
moans
as
persons
of
social
politeness
are
accustomed
to
listen
while
thinking
of
other
things
i
m
a
man
of
good
counsel
in
such
matters
my
dear
fellow
he
answered
well
let
me
tell
you
you
are
on
the
wrong
road
in
letting
aurelie
see
how
dear
she
is
to
you
allow
me
to
present
you
to
madame
antonia
there
s
a
heart
to
let
you
ll
soon
see
la
schontz
with
other
eyes
she
is
years
old
that
schontz
of
yours
and
madame
antonia
is
only
and
what
a
woman
i
may
say
she
is
my
pupil
if
madame
schontz
persists
in
keeping
on
the
hind
heels
of
her
pride
don
t
you
know
what
that
means
faith
no
that
she
wants
to
marry
and
if
that
s
the
case
nothing
can
hinder
her
from
leaving
you
after
a
lease
of
six
years
a
woman
has
a
right
to
do
so
now
if
you
will
only
listen
to
me
you
can
do
a
better
thing
for
yourself
your
wife
is
worth
more
than
all
the
schontzes
and
antonias
of
the
quartier
i
admit
the
conquest
is
difficult
but
it
is
not
impossible
and
after
all
that
has
happened
she
will
make
you
as
happy
as
an
orgon
in
any
case
you
mustn
t
look
like
a
fool
come
and
sup
with
no
i
love
aurelie
too
well
i
won
t
give
her
any
reason
to
complain
of
ah
my
dear
fellow
what
a
future
you
are
preparing
for
yourself
cried
maxime
it
is
eleven
o
clock
she
must
have
returned
from
the
ambigu
said
rochefide
leaving
the
club
and
he
called
out
his
coachman
to
drive
at
top
speed
to
the
rue
de
la
bruyere
madame
schontz
had
given
precise
directions
monsieur
could
enter
as
master
with
the
fullest
understanding
of
madame
but
warned
by
the
noise
of
monsieur
s
arrival
madame
had
so
arranged
that
the
sound
of
her
closing
as
women
s
doors
do
close
when
they
are
surprised
was
to
reach
monsieur
s
ears
then
at
a
corner
of
the
piano
fabien
s
hat
forgotten
intentionally
was
removed
very
awkwardly
by
a
maid
the
moment
after
monsieur
had
entered
the
room
did
you
go
to
the
ambigu
my
little
girl
no
i
changed
my
mind
and
stayed
at
home
to
play
who
came
to
see
you
asked
the
marquis
seeing
the
hat
carried
off
by
the
maid
no
at
that
audacious
falsehood
arthur
bowed
his
head
he
passed
beneath
the
caudine
forks
of
submission
a
real
love
descends
at
times
to
these
sublime
meannesses
arthur
behaved
with
madame
schontz
as
sabine
with
calyste
and
calyste
with
beatrix
within
a
week
the
transition
from
larva
to
butterfly
took
place
in
the
young
handsome
and
clever
comte
rusticoli
de
la
palferine
until
this
moment
of
his
life
he
had
lived
miserably
covering
his
deficits
with
an
audacity
equal
to
that
of
danton
but
he
now
paid
his
debts
he
now
by
advice
of
maxime
had
a
little
carriage
he
was
admitted
to
the
jockey
club
and
to
the
club
of
the
rue
de
gramont
he
became
supremely
elegant
and
he
published
in
the
journal
des
debats
a
novelette
which
won
him
in
a
few
days
a
reputation
which
authors
by
profession
obtain
after
years
of
toil
and
successes
only
for
there
is
nothing
so
usurping
in
paris
as
that
which
ought
to
be
ephemeral
nathan
very
certain
that
the
count
would
never
publish
anything
else
lauded
the
graceful
and
presuming
young
man
so
highly
to
beatrix
that
she
spurred
by
the
praise
of
the
poet
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
see
this
king
of
the
vagabonds
of
good
society
he
will
be
all
the
more
delighted
to
come
here
replied
nathan
because
as
i
happen
to
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
you
to
the
point
of
committing
all
sorts
of
but
i
am
told
he
has
already
committed
no
not
all
he
has
not
yet
committed
that
of
falling
in
love
with
a
virtuous
some
ten
days
after
the
scheme
plotted
on
the
boulevard
between
maxime
and
his
henchman
the
seductive
the
latter
to
whom
nature
had
given
no
doubt
sarcastically
a
face
of
charming
melancholy
made
his
first
irruption
into
the
nest
of
the
dove
of
the
rue
de
chartres
who
took
for
his
reception
an
evening
when
calyste
was
obliged
to
go
to
a
party
with
his
wife
if
you
should
ever
meet
la
palferine
you
will
understand
perfectly
the
success
obtained
in
a
single
evening
by
that
sparkling
mind
that
animated
fancy
especially
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
admirable
adroitness
of
the
showman
who
consented
to
superintend
this
debut
nathan
was
a
good
comrade
and
he
made
the
young
count
shine
as
a
jeweller
showing
off
an
ornament
in
hopes
to
sell
it
makes
the
diamonds
glitter
la
palferine
was
discreetly
the
first
to
withdraw
he
left
nathan
and
the
marquise
together
relying
on
the
collaboration
of
the
celebrated
author
which
was
admirable
seeing
that
beatrix
was
quite
astounded
raoul
put
fire
into
her
heart
by
pretended
reticences
which
stirred
the
fibres
of
a
curiosity
she
did
not
know
she
possessed
nathan
hinted
that
la
palferine
s
wit
was
not
so
much
the
cause
of
his
success
with
women
as
his
superiority
in
the
art
of
love
a
statement
which
magnified
the
count
immensely
this
is
the
place
to
record
a
new
effect
of
that
great
law
of
contraries
which
produces
so
many
crises
in
the
human
heart
and
accounts
for
such
varied
eccentricities
that
we
are
forced
to
remember
it
sometimes
as
well
as
its
counterpart
the
law
of
similitudes
all
courtesans
preserve
in
the
depths
of
their
heart
a
perennial
desire
to
recover
their
liberty
to
this
they
would
sacrifice
everything
they
feel
this
antithetical
need
with
such
intensity
that
it
is
rare
to
meet
with
one
of
these
women
who
has
not
aspired
several
times
to
a
return
to
virtue
through
love
they
are
not
discouraged
by
the
most
cruel
deceptions
on
the
other
hand
women
restrained
by
their
education
by
the
station
they
occupy
chained
by
the
rank
of
their
families
living
in
the
midst
of
opulence
and
wearing
a
halo
of
virtue
are
drawn
at
times
secretly
be
it
understood
toward
the
tropical
regions
of
love
these
two
natures
of
woman
so
opposed
to
each
other
have
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
the
one
that
faint
desire
for
virtue
the
other
that
faint
desire
for
libertinism
which
rousseau
was
the
first
to
have
the
courage
to
diagnose
in
one
it
is
a
last
reflexion
of
the
ray
divine
that
is
not
extinct
in
the
other
it
is
the
last
remains
of
our
primitive
clay
this
claw
of
the
beast
was
rapped
this
hair
of
the
devil
was
pulled
by
nathan
with
extreme
cleverness
the
marquise
began
to
ask
herself
seriously
if
up
to
the
present
time
she
had
not
been
the
dupe
of
her
head
and
whether
her
education
was
complete
vice
what
is
it
possibly
only
the
desire
to
know
everything
xxvi
disillusions
in
all
but
la
fontaine
s
fables
the
next
day
calyste
seemed
to
beatrix
just
what
he
was
a
perfect
and
loyal
gentleman
without
imagination
or
cleverness
in
paris
a
man
called
clever
must
have
spontaneous
brilliancy
as
the
fountains
have
water
men
of
the
world
and
parisians
in
general
are
in
that
way
very
clever
but
calyste
loved
too
deeply
he
was
too
much
absorbed
in
his
own
sentiments
to
perceive
the
change
in
beatrix
and
to
satisfy
her
need
by
displaying
new
resources
to
her
he
seemed
pale
indeed
after
the
brilliancy
of
the
night
before
and
he
caused
not
the
faintest
emotion
to
the
hungry
beatrix
a
great
love
is
a
credit
opened
to
a
power
so
voracious
that
bankruptcy
is
sure
to
come
sooner
or
later
in
spite
of
the
fatigue
of
this
day
the
day
when
a
woman
is
bored
by
a
lover
beatrix
trembled
with
fear
at
the
thought
of
a
possible
meeting
between
la
palferine
and
calyste
a
man
of
courage
without
assertion
she
hesitated
to
see
the
count
again
but
the
knot
of
her
hesitation
was
cut
by
a
decisive
event
beatrix
had
taken
the
third
of
a
box
at
the
opera
obscurely
situated
on
the
lower
tier
for
the
purpose
of
not
being
much
in
sight
for
the
last
few
days
calyste
grown
bolder
had
escorted
the
marquise
to
her
box
placing
himself
behind
her
and
timing
their
arrival
at
a
late
hour
so
as
to
meet
no
one
in
the
corridors
beatrix
on
these
occasions
left
the
box
alone
before
the
end
of
the
last
act
and
calyste
followed
at
a
distance
to
watch
over
her
although
old
antoine
was
always
there
to
attend
his
mistress
maxime
and
la
palferine
had
studied
this
strategy
which
was
prompted
by
respect
for
the
proprieties
also
by
that
desire
for
concealment
which
characterizes
the
idolators
of
the
little
god
and
also
again
by
the
fear
which
oppresses
all
women
who
have
been
constellations
in
the
world
and
whom
love
has
caused
to
fall
from
their
zodiacal
eminence
public
humiliation
is
dreaded
as
an
agony
more
cruel
than
death
itself
but
by
a
manoeuvre
of
maxime
s
that
blow
to
her
pride
that
outrage
which
women
secure
of
their
rank
in
olympus
cast
upon
others
who
have
fallen
from
their
midst
was
now
to
descend
on
beatrix
at
a
performance
of
lucia
which
ends
as
every
one
knows
with
one
of
the
finest
triumphs
of
rubini
madame
de
rochefide
whom
antoine
had
not
yet
come
to
fetch
reached
the
peristyle
of
the
by
the
lower
corridor
just
as
the
staircase
was
crowded
by
fashionable
women
ranged
on
the
stairs
or
standing
in
groups
below
it
awaiting
the
announcement
of
their
carriages
beatrix
was
instantly
recognized
whispers
which
soon
became
a
murmur
arose
in
every
group
in
a
moment
the
crowd
dispersed
the
marquise
was
left
alone
like
a
leper
calyste
dared
not
seeing
his
wife
on
the
staircase
advance
to
accompany
her
though
twice
she
vainly
cast
him
a
tearful
glance
a
prayer
that
he
would
come
to
her
at
that
moment
la
palferine
elegant
superb
charming
left
two
ladies
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
and
came
down
to
the
marquise
take
my
arm
he
said
bowing
and
walk
proudly
out
i
will
find
your
will
you
come
home
with
me
and
finish
the
evening
she
answered
getting
into
her
carriage
and
making
room
for
him
la
palferine
said
to
his
groom
follow
the
carriage
of
madame
and
then
he
jumped
into
it
beside
her
to
the
utter
stupefaction
of
calyste
who
stood
for
a
moment
planted
on
his
two
legs
as
if
they
were
lead
it
was
the
sight
of
him
standing
thus
pale
and
livid
that
caused
beatrix
to
make
the
sign
to
la
palferine
to
enter
her
carriage
doves
can
be
robespierres
in
spite
of
their
white
wings
three
carriages
reached
the
rue
de
chartres
with
thundering
rapidity
that
of
calyste
that
of
the
marquise
and
that
of
la
palferine
oh
you
here
said
beatrix
entering
her
salon
on
the
arm
of
the
young
count
and
finding
calyste
whose
horse
had
outstripped
those
of
the
other
carriages
then
you
know
monsieur
said
calyste
furiously
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
palferine
was
presented
to
me
ten
days
ago
by
nathan
she
replied
but
you
monsieur
have
known
me
four
years
and
i
am
ready
madame
said
to
make
the
marquise
d
espard
repent
to
her
third
generation
for
being
the
first
to
turn
away
from
ah
it
was
was
it
cried
beatrix
i
will
make
her
rue
to
revenge
yourself
thoroughly
said
the
young
man
in
her
ear
you
ought
to
recover
your
husband
and
i
am
capable
of
bringing
him
back
to
the
conversation
thus
begun
went
on
till
two
in
the
morning
without
allowing
calyste
whose
anger
was
again
and
again
repressed
by
a
look
from
beatrix
to
say
one
word
to
her
in
private
la
palferine
though
he
did
not
like
beatrix
showed
a
superiority
of
grace
good
taste
and
cleverness
equal
to
the
evident
inferiority
of
calyste
who
wriggled
in
his
chair
like
a
worm
cut
in
two
and
actually
rose
three
times
as
if
to
box
the
ears
of
la
palferine
the
third
time
that
he
made
a
dart
forward
the
young
count
said
to
him
are
you
in
pain
monsieur
in
a
manner
which
sent
calyste
back
to
his
chair
where
he
sat
as
rigid
as
a
the
marquise
conversed
with
the
ease
of
a
celimene
pretending
to
ignore
that
calyste
was
there
la
palferine
had
the
cleverness
to
depart
after
a
brilliant
witticism
leaving
the
two
lovers
to
a
quarrel
thus
by
maxime
s
machinations
the
fire
of
discord
flamed
in
the
separate
households
of
monsieur
and
of
madame
de
rochefide
the
next
day
learning
the
success
of
this
last
scene
from
la
palferine
at
the
jockey
club
where
the
young
count
was
playing
whist
maxime
went
to
the
hotel
schontz
to
ascertain
with
what
success
aurelie
was
rowing
her
boat
my
dear
said
madame
schontz
laughing
at
maxime
s
expression
i
am
at
an
end
of
my
expedients
rochefide
is
incurable
i
end
my
career
of
gallantry
by
perceiving
that
cleverness
is
a
explain
to
me
that
in
the
first
place
my
dear
friend
i
have
kept
arthur
for
the
last
week
to
a
regimen
of
kicks
on
the
shin
and
perpetual
wrangling
and
jarring
in
short
all
we
have
that
is
most
disagreeable
in
our
business
you
are
ill
he
says
to
me
with
paternal
sweetness
for
i
have
been
good
to
you
always
and
i
love
you
to
you
are
to
blame
for
one
thing
my
dear
i
answered
you
bore
well
if
i
do
haven
t
you
the
wittiest
and
handsomest
young
man
in
paris
to
amuse
you
said
the
poor
man
i
was
caught
i
actually
felt
i
loved
ah
said
maxime
how
could
i
help
it
feeling
is
stronger
than
we
one
can
t
resist
such
things
so
i
changed
pedals
i
began
to
entice
my
judicial
now
turned
like
arthur
to
a
sheep
i
gave
him
arthur
s
sofa
heavens
how
he
bored
me
but
you
understand
i
had
to
have
fabien
there
to
let
arthur
surprise
well
cried
maxime
go
on
what
happened
was
arthur
furious
you
know
nothing
about
it
my
old
fellow
when
arthur
came
in
and
surprised
us
fabien
and
me
he
retreated
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
to
the
where
he
began
to
clear
his
throat
broum
broum
and
cough
and
knock
the
chairs
about
that
great
fool
of
a
fabien
to
whom
of
course
i
can
t
explain
the
whole
matter
was
frightened
there
my
dear
maxime
is
the
point
we
have
maxime
nodded
his
head
and
played
for
a
few
moments
with
his
cane
i
have
known
such
natures
he
said
and
the
only
way
for
you
to
do
is
to
pitch
arthur
out
of
the
window
and
lock
the
door
upon
him
this
is
how
you
must
manage
it
play
that
scene
over
again
with
fabien
when
arthur
surprises
you
give
fabien
a
glance
arthur
can
t
mistake
if
he
gets
angry
that
will
end
the
matter
if
he
still
says
broum
broum
it
is
just
as
good
you
can
end
it
a
better
how
why
get
angry
and
say
i
believed
you
loved
me
respected
me
but
i
see
you
ve
no
feeling
at
all
not
even
jealousy
you
know
the
tirade
in
a
case
like
this
maxime
bring
me
in
would
kill
his
man
on
the
spot
then
weep
and
fabien
he
mortify
him
by
comparing
him
with
that
fellow
fabien
whom
i
love
fabien
would
have
drawn
a
dagger
and
stabbed
you
to
the
heart
ah
that
s
what
it
is
to
love
farewell
monsieur
take
back
your
house
and
all
your
property
i
shall
marry
fabien
gives
me
his
name
marries
me
in
spite
of
his
old
mother
but
i
see
i
see
cried
madame
schontz
i
ll
be
superb
ah
maxime
there
will
never
be
but
one
maxime
just
as
there
s
only
one
de
la
palferine

better
than
i
replied
the
comte
de
trailles
modestly
he
ll
make
his
la
palferine

tongue
but
you
have
fist
and
loins
what
weights
you
ve
carried
what
cuffs
you
ve
given
la
palferine

all
that
too
he
is
deep
and
he
is
educated
whereas
i
am
ignorant
replied
maxime
i
have
seen
rastignac
who
has
made
an

approbation

maxime
i

put

my
two
days
later
as
they
met
on
the
threshold
of
the
jockey
club
said
to
maxime
it
is
the
words
which
contained
a
drama
accomplished
in
part
by
vengeance
made

and
in
all

always
mind
enough
give
him
time
to
collect
it
i
m
superb
at
that
sort
of
the
two
conspirators
entered
the
salon
together
and
found
rochefide
aged
by
two
years
he
had
not
even
put
on
his
corset
his
beard
had
sprouted
and
all
his
elegance
was
gone
well
my
dear
marquis
said
maxime
ah
my
dear
fellow
my
life
is
arthur
talked
for
ten
minutes
and
maxime
listened
gravely
thinking
all
the
while
of
his
own
marriage
which
was
now
to
take
place
within
a
week
my
dear
arthur
he
replied
at
last
i
told
you
the
only
means
i
knew
to
keep
aurelie
but
you
wouldn
t
what
was
it
didn
t
i
advise
you
to
go
and
sup
with
antonia
yes
you
did
but
how
could
i
i
love
and
you
you
only
make
love
listen
to
me
arthur
give
aurelie
three
hundred
thousand
francs
for
that
little
house
and
i
ll
promise
to
find
some
one
to
suit
you
better
i
ll
talk
to
you
about
it
later
for
there
s
d
ajuda
making
signs
that
he
wants
to
speak
to
and
maxime
left
the
inconsolable
man
for
the
representative
of
a
family
in
need
of
consolation
my
dear
fellow
said
d
ajuda
in
his
ear
the
duchess
is
in
despair
calyste
is
having
his
trunks
packed
secretly
and
he
has
taken
out
a
passport
sabine
wants
to
follow
them
surprise
beatrix
and
maul
her
she
is
pregnant
and
it
takes
the
turn
of
murderous
ideas
she
has
actually
and
openly
bought
tell
the
duchess
that
madame
de
rochefide
will
not
leave
paris
but
within
a
fortnight
she
will
have
left
calyste
now
d
ajuda
shake
hands
neither
you
nor
i
have
ever
said
or
known
or
done
anything
about
this
we
admire
the
chances
of
life
that
s
the
duchess
has
already
made
me
swear
on
the
holy
gospels
to
hold
my
will
you
receive
my
wife
a
month
hence
with
then
every
one
all
round
will
be
satisfied
said
maxime
only
remind
the
duchess
that
she
must
make
that
journey
to
italy
with
the
du
guenics
and
the
sooner
the
for
ten
days
calyste
was
made
to
bear
the
weight
of
an
anger
all
the
more
invincible
because
it
was
in
part
the
effect
of
a
real
passion
beatrix
now
experienced
the
love
so
brutally
but
faithfully
described
to
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
by
maxime
de
trailles
perhaps
no
beings
exist
who
do
not
experience
that
terrible
passion
once
in
the
course
of
their
lives
the
marquise
felt
herself
mastered
by
a
superior
force
by
a
young
man
on
whom
her
rank
and
quality
did
not
impose
who
as
noble
as
herself
regarded
her
with
an
eye
both
powerful
and
calm
and
from
whom
her
greatest
feminine
arts
and
efforts
could
with
difficulty
obtain
even
a
smile
of
approval
in
short
she
was
oppressed
by
a
tyrant
who
never
left
her
that
she
did
not
fall
to
weeping
bruised
and
wounded
yet
believing
herself
to
blame
played
upon
madame
de
rochefide
the
same
comedy
madame
de
rochefide
had
played
on
calyste
for
the
last
six
months
since
her
public
humiliation
at
the
opera
beatrix
had
never
ceased
to
treat
monsieur
du
guenic
on
the
basis
of
the
following
proposition
you
have
preferred
your
wife
and
the
opinion
of
the
world
to
me
if
you
wish
to
prove
that
you
love
me
sacrifice
your
wife
and
the
world
to
me
abandon
sabine
and
let
us
live
in
switzerland
italy
or
entrenched
in
that
hard
she
established
the
blockade
which
women
declare
by
frigid
glances
disdainful
gestures
and
a
certain
demeanor
if
we
may
so
call
it
she
thought
herself
delivered
from
calyste
supposing
that
he
would
never
dare
to
break
openly
with
the
grandlieus
to
desert
sabine
to
whom
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
left
her
fortune
would
doom
him
to
penury
but
calyste
with
despair
had
secretly
obtained
a
passport
and
had
written
to
his
mother
begging
her
to
send
him
at
once
a
considerable
sum
of
money
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
these
funds
he
set
himself
to
watch
beatrix
consumed
by
the
fury
of
breton
jealousy
at
last
nine
days
after
the
communication
made
by
la
palferine
to
maxime
at
the
club
calyste
to
whom
his
mother
had
forwarded
thirty
thousand
francs
went
to
madame
de
rochefide
s
house
with
the
firm
intention
of
forcing
the
blockade
driving
away
la
palferine
and
leaving
paris
with
his
pacified
angel
it
was
one
of
those
horrible
alternatives
in
which
women
who
have
hitherto
retained
some
little
respect
for
themselves
plunge
at
once
and
forever
into
the
degradations
of
vice
though
it
is
possible
to
return
thence
to
virtue
until
this
moment
madame
de
rochefide
had
regarded
herself
as
a
virtuous
woman
in
heart
upon
whom
two
passions
had
fallen
but
to
adore
and
still
let
calyste
adore
her
would
be
to
lose
her
for
where
deception
begins
infamy
begins
she
had
given
rights
to
calyste
and
no
human
power
could
prevent
the
breton
from
falling
at
her
feet
and
watering
them
with
the
tears
of
an
absolute
repentance
many
persons
are
surprised
at
the
glacial
insensibility
under
which
women
extinguish
their
loves
but
if
they
did
not
thus
efface
their
past
their
lives
could
have
no
dignity
they
could
never
maintain
themselves
against
the
fatal
familiarity
to
which
they
had
once
submitted
in
the
entirely
new
situation
in
which
beatrix
found
herself
she
might
have
evaded
the
alternatives
presented
to
her
by
calyste
had
la
palferine
entered
the
room
but
the
vigilance
of
her
old
footman
antoine
defeated
her
hearing
a
carriage
stop
before
the
door
she
said
to
calyste
here
come
visitors
and
she
rushed
forward
to
prevent
a
scene
antoine
however
as
a
prudent
man
had
told
la
palferine
that
madame
la
marquise
was
out
when
beatrix
heard
from
the
old
servant
who
had
called
and
the
answer
he
had
given
she
replied
very
good
and
returned
to
the
salon
thinking
i
will
escape
into
a
convent
i
will
make
myself
a
calyste
meantime
had
opened
the
window
and
seen
his
rival
who
came
he
said
to
beatrix
on
her
return
i
don
t
know
antoine
is
still
it
was
la
you
love
him
and
that
is
why
you
are
blaming
and
reproaching
me
i
saw
him
you
saw
him
i
opened
the
beatrix
fell
half
fainting
on
the
sofa
then
she
negotiated
in
order
to
gain
time
she
asked
to
have
the
journey
postponed
for
a
week
under
pretence
of
making
preparations
inwardly
resolving
to
turn
calyste
off
in
a
way
that
she
could
satisfy
la
palferine
for
such
are
the
wretched
calculations
and
the
fiery
anguish
concealed
with
these
lives
which
have
left
the
rails
along
which
the
great
social
train
rolls
on
when
calyste
had
left
her
beatrix
felt
so
wretched
so
profoundly
humiliated
that
she
went
to
bed
she
was
really
ill
the
violent
struggle
which
wrung
her
heart
seemed
to
reach
a
physical
reaction
and
she
sent
for
the
doctor
but
at
the
same
time
she
despatched
to
la
palferine
the
following
letter
in
which
she
revenged
herself
on
calyste
with
a
sort
of
rage
to
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
palferine
my
friend
come
and
see
me
i
am
in
despair
antoine
sent
you
away
when
your
arrival
would
have
put
an
end
to
one
of
the
most
horrible
nightmares
of
my
life
and
delivered
me
from
a
man
i
hate
and
whom
i
trust
never
to
see
again
i
love
you
only
in
this
world
and
i
can
never
again
love
any
one
but
you
though
i
have
the
misfortune
not
to
please
you
as
i
fain
would
she
wrote
four
pages
which
beginning
thus
ended
in
an
exaltation
too
poetic
for
typography
in
which
she
compromised
herself
so
completely
that
the
letter
closed
with
these
words
am
i
sufficiently
at
your
mercy
ah
nothing
will
cost
me
anything
if
it
only
proves
to
you
how
much
you
are
and
she
signed
the
letter
a
thing
she
had
never
done
for
conti
or
calyste
the
next
day
at
the
hour
when
la
palferine
called
beatrix
was
in
her
bath
and
antoine
begged
him
to
wait
he
in
his
turn
saw
calyste
sent
away
for
du
guenic
hungry
for
love
came
early
la
palferine
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
his
rival
s
departure
when
beatrix
entered
the
salon
ah
charles
she
cried
expecting
what
had
happened
you
have
ruined
me
i
know
it
madame
replied
la
palferine
tranquilly
you
have
sworn
to
love
me
alone
you
have
offered
to
give
me
a
letter
in
which
you
will
write
your
motives
for
destroying
yourself
so
that
in
case
of
infidelity
i
may
poison
you
without
fear
of
human
justice
as
if
superior
men
needed
to
have
recourse
to
poison
for
revenge
you
have
written
to
me
nothing
will
cost
me
anything
if
it
only
proves
to
you
how
much
you
are
well
after
that
i
find
a
contradiction
between
those
words
and
your
present
remark
that
i
have
ruined
you
i
must
know
now
if
you
have
had
the
courage
to
break
with
du
ah
you
have
your
revenge
upon
him
in
advance
she
cried
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
henceforth
you
and
i
are
forever
bound
madame
said
the
prince
of
bohemia
coldly
if
you
wish
me
for
your
friend
i
consent
but
on
one
condition
condition
she
exclaimed
yes
the
following
condition
you
must
be
reconciled
to
monsieur
de
rochefide
you
must
recover
the
honor
of
your
position
you
must
return
to
your
handsome
house
in
the
due
d
anjou
and
be
once
more
one
of
the
queens
of
paris
you
can
do
this
by
making
rochefide
play
a
part
in
politics
and
putting
into
your
own
conduct
the
persistency
which
madame
d
espard
has
displayed
that
is
the
situation
necessary
for
the
woman
to
whom
i
do
the
honor
to
give
but
you
forget
that
monsieur
de
rochefide
s
consent
is
oh
my
dear
child
said
la
palferine
we
have
arranged
all
that
i
have
given
my
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
that
you
are
worth
all
the
schontzes
of
the
quartier
and
you
must
fulfil
my
for
the
next
week
calyste
went
every
day
to
madame
de
rochefide
s
door
only
to
be
refused
by
antoine
who
said
with
a
studied
face
madame
is
from
there
calyste
hurried
to
la
palferine
s
lodging
where
the
valet
answered
monsieur
le
comte
is
away
each
time
this
happened
the
breton
baron
left
a
letter
for
la
palferine
on
the
ninth
day
calyste
received
a
line
from
la
palferine
making
an
appointment
to
receive
him
he
hurried
to
his
lodgings
and
found
the
count
but
in
company
with
maxime
de
trailles
to
whom
the
young
no
doubt
wished
to
give
proof
of
his
by
making
him
a
witness
of
this
scene
monsieur
le
baron
began
tranquilly
here
are
the
six
letters
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
write
to
me
they
are
as
you
see
safe
and
sound
they
have
not
been
unsealed
i
knew
in
advance
what
they
were
likely
to
contain
having
learned
that
you
have
been
seeking
me
since
the
day
when
i
looked
at
you
from
the
window
of
a
house
from
which
you
had
looked
at
me
on
the
previous
day
i
thought
i
had
better
ignore
all
mistaken
provocations
between
ourselves
i
am
sure
you
have
too
much
good
taste
to
be
angry
with
a
woman
for
no
longer
loving
you
it
is
always
a
bad
means
of
recovering
her
to
seek
a
quarrel
with
the
one
preferred
but
in
the
present
case
your
letters
have
a
radical
fault
a
nullity
as
the
lawyers
say
you
have
too
much
good
sense
i
am
sure
to
complain
of
a
husband
who
takes
back
his
wife
monsieur
de
rochefide
has
felt
that
the
position
of
the
marquise
was
undignified
you
will
therefore
no
longer
find
madame
de
rochefide
in
the
rue
de
chartres
but
six
months
hence
next
winter
in
the
hotel
de
rochefide
you
flung
yourself
rather
heedlessly
into
the
midst
of
a
reconciliation
between
husband
and
wife
which
you
provoked
yourself
by
not
saving
madame
de
rochefide
from
the
humiliation
to
which
she
was
subjected
at
the
opera
on
coming
away
the
marquise
to
whom
i
had
already
carried
certain
amicable
proposals
from
her
husband
took
me
up
in
her
carriage
and
her
first
words
were
bring
arthur
back
to
me
ah
yes
cried
calyste
she
was
right
i
was
wanting
in
true
unhappily
monsieur
rochefide
was
living
with
one
of
those
atrocious
women
madame
schontz
who
had
long
been
expecting
him
to
leave
her
she
had
counted
on
madame
de
rochefide
s
failure
in
health
and
expected
some
day
to
see
herself
marquise
finding
her
castles
in
the
air
thus
scattered
she
determined
to
revenge
herself
on
husband
and
wife
such
women
monsieur
will
put
out
one
of
their
own
eyes
to
put
out
two
of
their
enemy
la
schontz
who
has
just
left
paris
has
put
out
six
if
i
had
had
the
imprudence
to
love
the
marquise
madame
schontz
would
have
put
out
eight
you
see
now
that
you
are
in
need
of
an
maxime
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
change
that
came
over
calyste
s
face
which
turned
deadly
pale
as
his
eyes
were
opened
to
his
situation
would
you
believe
monsieur
le
baron
that
that
unworthy
woman
has
given
her
hand
to
the
man
who
furnished
the
means
for
her
revenge
ah
these
women
you
can
understand
now
why
arthur
and
his
wife
should
have
retired
for
a
time
to
their
delightful
little
at
they
ll
recover
their
eyesight
there
during
their
stay
in
the
country
the
hotel
de
rochefide
is
to
be
renovated
and
the
marquise
intends
to
display
on
her
return
a
princely
splendor
when
a
woman
so
noble
the
victim
of
conjugal
love
finds
courage
to
return
to
her
duty
the
part
of
a
man
who
adores
her
as
you
do
and
admires
her
as
i
admire
her
is
to
remain
her
friend
although
we
can
do
nothing
more
you
will
excuse
me
i
know
for
having
made
monsieur
le
comte
de
trailles
a
witness
of
this
explanation
but
i
have
been
most
anxious
to
make
myself
perfectly
clear
throughout
as
for
my
own
sentiments
i
am
above
all
desirous
to
say
to
you
that
although
i
admire
madame
de
rochefide
for
her
intellect
she
is
supremely
displeasing
to
me
as
a
and
so
end
our
noblest
dreams
our
celestial
loves
said
calyste
dumfounded
by
so
many
revelations
and
disillusionments
yes
in
the
serpent
s
tail
said
maxime
or
worse
still
in
the
vial
of
an
apothecary
i
never
knew
a
first
love
that
did
not
end
foolishly
ah
monsieur
le
baron
all
that
man
has
of
the
divine
within
him
finds
its
food
in
heaven
only
that
is
what
justifies
the
lives
of
us
for
myself
i
have
pondered
this
question
deeply
and
as
you
know
i
was
married
yesterday
i
shall
be
faithful
to
my
wife
and
i
advise
you
to
return
to
madame
du
guenic
but
not
for
three
months
don
t
regret
beatrix
she
is
the
model
of
a
vain
and
empty
nature
without
strength
coquettish
for
only
a
madame
d
espard
without
her
profound
political
capacity
a
woman
without
heart
and
without
head
floundering
in
evil
madame
de
rochefide
loves
madame
de
rochefide
only
she
would
have
parted
you
from
madame
du
guenic
without
the
possibility
of
return
and
then
she
would
have
left
you
in
the
lurch
without
remorse
in
short
that
woman
is
as
incomplete
for
vice
as
she
is
for
i
don
t
agree
with
you
maxime
said
la
palferine
i
think
she
will
make
the
most
delightful
mistress
of
a
salon

shaking

with

thanking
them
for
having
pricked

days
later
the
duchesse
de
grandlieu
who
had
not
seen
her
daughter
sabine
since
the
morning
when
this
conference
took
place
went
to
the
hotel
du
guenic
early
in
the
day
and
found
calyste
in
his
bath
with
sabine
beside
him
working
at
some
adornment
for
the
future
what
has
happened
to
you
my
children
asked
the
excellent
duchess
nothing
but
good
dear
mamma
replied
sabine

her
eyes
radiant
with
happiness
to
her
mother

that

out
his
hand
to
his
wife
and
pressed
hers
so
tenderly
with
a
look
so
eloquent
that
she

in

whisper
to
the
duchess
i
am
loved
