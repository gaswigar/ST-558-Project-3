s
russian
uncle
s
dream
and
the
permanent
husband
celebrated
russian
novels
by
fedor
dostoieffsky
from
the
original
russian
by
fred
there
are
three
russian
novelists
who
though
with
one
exception
little
known
out
of
their
own
country
stand
head
and
shoulders
above
most
of
their
contemporaries
in
the
opinion
of
some
not
indifferent
critics
they
are
superior
to
all
other
novelists
of
this
generation
two
of
them
dostoieffsky
and
turgenieff
died
not
long
ago
the
third
lyof
tolstoi
still
lives
the
one
with
the
most
marked
individuality
of
character
probably
the
most
highly
gifted
was
unquestionably
crown
containing
nearly
pages
price
the
idiot
is
unquestionably
a
work
of
great
power
and
originality
dostoieffsky
crowds
his
canvas
with
living
organisms
depicted
with
extreme
crown
price
the
friend
of
the
family
and
the
gambler
dostoieffsky
is
one
of
the
keenest
observers
of
humanity
amongst
modern
novelists
both
stories
are
very
valuable
as
pictures
of
a
society
and
a
people
with
whom
we
are
imperfectly
acquainted
but
who
deserve
the
closest
edition
in
crown
with
portrait
and
memoir
price
injury
and
insult
that
injury
and
insult
is
a
powerful
novel
few
will
deny
vania
is
a
marvellous
character
once
read
the
book
can
never
be
stephen
s
a
masterpiece
of
fiction
the
author
has
treated
with
consummate
tact
the
difficult
character
of
natasha
the
incarnation
of
the
slave
of
she
lives
and
breathes
in
these
vivid
pages
and
the
reader
is
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
her
anguish
and
rejoices
when
she
breaks
free
from
her
edition
in
crown
pages
price
crime
and
punishment
dostoieffsky
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
of
modern
writers
and
his
book
crime
and
punishment
is
one
of
the
most
moving
of
modern
novels
it
is
the
story
of
a
murder
and
of
the
punishment
which
dogs
the
murderer
and
its
effect
is
unique
in
fiction
it
is
realism
but
such
realism
as
zola
and
his
followers
do
not
dream
of
the
reader
knows
the
grotesque
terrible
personages
they
intimately
than
if
he
had
been
years
with
them
in
the
flesh
he
is
constrained
to
live
their
lives
to
suffer
their
tortures
to
scheme
and
resist
with
them
exult
with
them
weep
and
laugh
and
despair
with
them
he
breathes
the
very
breath
of
their
nostrils
and
with
the
madness
that
comes
upon
them
he
is
afflicted
even
as
they
this
sounds
extravagant
praise
no
doubt
but
only
to
those
who
have
not
read
the
volume
to
those

we
are
sure
that
it

chapter
maria
alexandrovna
moskaleva
was
the
principal
lady
of
was
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
she
always
bore
herself
as
though
did
not
care
a
fig
for
anyone
but
as
though
no
one
else
could
do
without
true
there
were
uncommonly
few
who
loved
fact
i
may
say
that
very
many
detested
her
still
everyone
was
afraid
of
her
and
that
was
what
she
liked
now
why
did
maria
alexandrovna
who
dearly
loves
scandal
and
can
not
sleep
at
night
unless
she
has
heard
something
new
and
piquant
the
day
before
or
how
did
she
know
how
to
bear
herself
so
that
it
would
never
strike
anyone
looking
at
her
to
suppose
that
the
dignified
lady
was
the
most
inveterate
in
the
at
all
events
in
mordasoff
on
the
contrary
anyone
would
have
said
at
once
that
scandals
and
pettiness
must
vanish
in
her
presence
and
that
caught
by
maria
alexandrovna
would
blush
and
tremble
like
schoolboys
at
the
entrance
of
the
master
and
that
the
talk
would
immediately
be
diverted
into
channels
of
the
loftiest
and
most
sublime
subjects
so
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
maria
alexandrovna
knew
many
deadly
and
scandalous
secrets
of
certain
other
mordasoff
inhabitants
which
if
she
liked
to
reveal
them
at
any
convenient
opportunity
would
produce
results
little
less
terrible
than
the
earthquake
of
lisbon
still
she
was
very
quiet
about
the
secrets
she
knew
and
never
let
them
out
except
in
cases
of
absolute
need
and
then
only
to
her
nearest
and
dearest
friends
she
liked
to
hint
that
she
knew
certain
things
and
frighten
people
out
of
their
wits
preferring
to
keep
them
in
a
state
of
perpetual
terror
rather
than
crush
them
altogether
this
was
real
talent
of
tactics
we
all
considered
maria
alexandrovna
as
our
type
and
model
of
irreproachable
she
had
no
rival
in
this
respect
in
mordasoff
she
could
kill
and
annihilate
and
pulverize
any
rival
with
a
single
word
we
have
seen
her
do
it
and
all
the
while
she
would
look
as
though
she
had
not
even
observed
that
she
had
let
the
fatal
word
fall
everyone
knows
that
this
trait
is
a
speciality
of
the
highest
circles
her
circle
of
friends
was
large
many
visitors
to
mordasoff
left
the
town
again
in
an
ecstasy
over
her
reception
of
them
and
carried
on
a
correspondence
with
her
afterwards
somebody
even
addressed
some
poetry
to
her
which
she
showed
about
the
place
with
great
pride
the
novelist
who
came
to
the
town
used
to
read
his
novel
to
her
of
an
evening
and
ended
by
dedicating
it
to
her
which
produced
a
very
agreeable
effect
a
certain
german
professor
who
came
from
carlsbad
to
inquire
into
the
question
of
a
little
worm
with
horns
which
abounds
in
our
part
of
the
world
and
who
wrote
and
published
four
large
quarto
volumes
about
this
same
little
insect
was
so
delighted
and
ravished
with
her
amiability
and
kindness
that
to
this
very
day
he
carries
on
a
most
improving
correspondence
upon
moral
subjects
from
far
carlsbad
some
people
have
compared
maria
alexandrovna
in
certain
respects
with
napoleon
of
course
it
may
have
been
her
enemies
who
did
so
in
order
to
bring
maria
alexandrovna
to
scorn
but
all
i
can
say
is
how
is
it
that
napoleon
when
he
rose
to
his
highest
that
high
estate
of
his
became
giddy
and
fell
historians
of
the
old
school
have
ascribed
this
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
only
not
of
royal
blood
but
was
not
even
a
gentleman
and
therefore
when
he
rose
too
high
he
thought
of
his
proper
place
the
ground
became
giddy
and
fell
but
why
did
not
maria
alexandrovna
s
head
whirl
and
how
was
it
that
she
could
always
keep
her
place
as
the
first
lady
of
mordasoff
people
have
often
said
this
sort
of
thing
of
maria
alexandrovna
for
instance
but
how
would
she
act
under
such
and
such
difficult
circumstances
yet
when
the
circumstances
arose
maria
alexandrovna
invariably
rose
also
to
the
emergency
for
instance
when
her
obliged
to
throw
up
his
appointment
out
of
pure
incapacity
and
feebleness
of
intellect
just
before
the
government
inspector
came
down
to
look
into
matters
all
mordasoff
danced
with
delight
to
think
that
she
would
be
down
on
her
knees
to
this
inspector
begging
and
beseeching
and
weeping
and
fact
that
she
would
drop
her
wings
and
fall
but
bless
you
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
maria
alexandrovna
quite
understood
that
her
husband
was
beyond
praying
for
he
must
retire
so
she
only
rearranged
her
affairs
a
little
in
such
a
manner
that
she
lost
not
a
scrap
of
her
influence
in
the
place
and
her
house
still
remained
the
acknowledged
head
of
all
mordasoff
society
the
procurer
s
wife
anna
nicolaevna
antipova
the
sworn
foe
of
maria
alexandrovna
though
a
friend
so
far
as
could
be
judged
outside
had
already
blown
the
trumpet
of
victory
over
her
rival
but
when
society
found
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
extremely
difficult
to
put
down
they
were
obliged
to
conclude
that
the
latter
had
struck
her
roots
far
deeper
than
they
had
thought
for
as
i
have
mentioned
afanassy
matveyevitch
maria
alexandrovna
s
husband
i
may
as
well
add
a
few
words
about
him
in
this
place
firstly
then
he
was
a
most
presentable
man
so
far
as
exterior
goes
and
a
very
person
besides
but
in
critical
moments
he
used
to
lose
his
head
and
stand
looking
like
a
sheep
which
has
come
across
a
new
gate
he
looked
very
majestic
and
dignified
in
his
and
white
tie
at
dinner
parties
and
so
on
but
his
dignity
only
lasted
until
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
for
you
d
better
have
shut
your
ears
ladies
and
gentlemen
when
he
began
to
s
all
everyone
agreed
that
he
was
quite
unworthy
to
be
maria
alexandrovna
s
husband
he
only
sat
in
his
place
by
virtue
of
his
wife
s
genius
in
my
humble
opinion
he
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
derogated
to
the
office
of
frightening
sparrows
in
the
kitchen
garden
there
and
only
there
would
he
have
been
in
his
proper
sphere
and
doing
some
good
to
his
fellow
countrymen
therefore
i
think
maria
alexandrovna
did
a
very
wise
thing
when
she
sent
him
away
to
her
village
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
town
where
she
possessed
a
property
of
some
hundred
and
twenty
to
tell
the
truth
was
all
she
had
to
keep
up
the
respectability
and
grandeur
of
her
noble
house
upon
everybody
knew
that
afanassy
was
only
kept
because
he
had
earned
a
salary
and
perquisites
so
that
when
he
ceased
to
earn
the
said
salary
and
perquisites
it
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
sent
returned
empty
to
the
village
as
useless
and
fit
for
nothing
in
fact
everyone
praised
his
wife
for
her
soundness
of
judgment
and
decision
of
character
afanassy
lived
in
clover
at
the
village
i
called
on
him
there
once
and
spent
a
very
pleasant
hour
he
tied
on
his
white
ties
cleaned
his
boots
himself
not
because
he
had
to
do
it
for
him
but
for
the
sake
of
art
for
he
loved
to
have
them
went
to
the
bath
as
often
as
he
could
had
tea
four
times
a
day
and
was
as
contented
as
possible
do
you
remember
a
year
and
a
half
ago
the
dreadful
stories
that
were
afoot
about
zenaida
maria
alexandrovna
s
and
afanassy
s
daughter
zenaida
was
undoubtedly
a
fine
handsome
girl
but
she
was
now
years
old
and
not
married
yet
among
the
reasons
put
forth
for
zenaida
being
still
a
maid
one
of
the
strongest
was
those
dark
rumours
about
a
strange
attachment
a
year
and
a
half
ago
with
the
schoolmaster
of
the
not
hushed
up
even
to
this
day
yes
to
this
very
day
they
tell
of
a
written
by
zina
as
she
was
called
and
handed
all
about
mordasoff
but
kindly
tell
me
who
ever
saw
this
letter
if
it
went
from
hand
to
hand
what
became
of
it
everyone
seems
to
have
heard
of
it
but
no
one
ever
saw
it
at
all
events
have
never
met
anyone
who
actually
saw
the
letter
with
his
own
eyes
if
you
drop
a
hint
to
maria
alexandrovna
about
it
she
simply
does
not
understand
you
well
supposing
that
there
something
and
that
zina
did
write
such
a
letter
what
dexterity
and
skill
of
maria
alexandrovna
to
have
so
ably
nipped
the
bud
of
the
scandal
i
feel
sure
that
zina
write
the
letter
but
maria
alexandrovna
has
managed
so
well
that
there
is
not
a
trace
not
a
shred
of
evidence
of
the
existence
of
it
goodness
knows
how
she
must
have
worked
and
planned
to
save
the
reputation
of
this
only
daughter
of
hers
but
she
managed
it
somehow
as
for
zina
not
having
married
there
s
nothing
surprising
in
that
why
what
sort
of
a
husband
could
be
found
for
her
in
mordasoff
zina
ought
to
marry
a
reigning
prince
if
anyone
did
you
ever
see
such
a
beauty
among
beauties
as
zina
i
think
not
of
course
she
was
very
proud
there
was
people
said
she
was
likely
to
end
by
marrying
but
i
never
thought
so
why
what
was
there
in
mosgliakoff
true
he
was
young
and
good
looking
and
possessed
an
estate
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
souls
and
was
a
petersburg
swell
but
in
the
first
place
i
don
t
think
there
was
much
inside
his
head
he
was
such
a
funny
sort
of
man
besides
what
is
an
estate
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
souls
according
to
present
notions
oh
no
that
s
a
marriage
that
never
could
come
off
there
kind
reader
all
you
have
just
read
was
written
by
me
some
five
months
ago
for
my
own
amusement
i
admit
i
am
rather
partial
to
maria
alexandrovna
and
i
wished
to
write
some
sort
of
laudatory
account
of
that
charming
woman
and
to
mould
it
into
the
form
of
one
of
those
playful
letters
to
a
friend
purporting
to
have
been
written
in
the
old
golden
days
which
will
never
heaven
to
one
of
the
periodicals
of
the
time
the
northern
bee
or
some
such
paper
but
since
i
have
no
friend
and
since
i
am
besides
naturally
of
a
timid
disposition
and
especially
so
as
to
my
literary
efforts
the
essay
remained
on
my
as
a
memorial
of
my
early
literary
attempts
and
in
memory
of
the
peaceful
occupation
of
a
moment
or
two
of
leisure
well
five
months
have
gone
by
and
lo
great
things
have
happened
at
mordasoff
prince
drove
into
the
town
at
an
early
hour
one
fine
morning
and
put
up
at
maria
alexandrovna
s
house
the
prince
only
stayed
three
days
but
his
visit
proved
pregnant
with
the
most
fatal
consequences
i
will
say
prince
brought
about
what
was
in
a
certain
sense
a
revolution
in
the
town
an
account
of
which
revolution
will
of
course
comprise
some
of
the
most
important
events
that
have
ever
happened
in
mordasoff
and
i
have
determined
at
last
after
many
and
flutterings
and
much
doubt
to
arrange
the
story
into
the
orthodox
literary
form
of
a
novel
and
present
it
to
the
indulgent
public
my
tale
will
include
a
narrative
of
the
rise
and
greatness
and
triumphant
fall
of
maria
alexandrovna
and
of
all
her
house
in
mordasoff
a
theme
both
worthy
of
and
attractive
to
any
writer
of
course
i
must
first
explain
why
there
should
have
been
anything
extraordinary
in
the
fact
that
prince
came
to
mordasoff
and
put
up
at
maria
alexandrovna
s
mansion
and
in
order
to
do
this
i
must
first
be
allowed
to
say
a
few
words
about
this
same
prince
this
i
shall
now
do
a
short
biography
of
the
nobleman
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
further
working
out
of
my
story
so
reader
you
must
excuse
me
chapter
ii
i
will
begin
then
by
stating
that
prince
was
not
so
very
very
old
although
to
look
at
him
you
would
think
he
fall
to
pieces
every
moment
so
decayed
or
rather
was
he
at
mordasoff
all
sorts
of
strange
things
were
told
of
him
some
declared
that
the
old
prince
s
wits
had
forsaken
him
all
agreed
that
it
was
passing
strange
that
the
owner
of
a
magnificent
property
of
four
thousand
souls
a
man
of
rank
and
one
who
could
have
if
he
liked
a
great
influence
and
play
a
great
part
in
his
country
s
affairs
that
such
a
man
should
live
all
alone
upon
his
estate
and
make
an
absolute
hermit
of
himself
as
did
prince
many
who
had
known
him
a
few
years
before
insisted
upon
it
that
he
was
very
far
from
loving
solitude
then
and
was
as
unlike
a
hermit
as
anyone
could
possibly
be
however
here
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
learn
authentically
as
to
his
antecedents
etc
some
time
or
other
in
his
younger
must
have
been
a
mighty
long
while
ago
prince
made
a
most
brilliant
entry
into
life
he
knocked
about
and
enjoyed
himself
and
sang
romantic
songs
and
wrote
epigrams
and
led
a
fast
life
generally
very
often
abroad
and
was
full
of
gifts
and
intellectual
capacity
of
course
he
very
soon
ran
through
his
means
and
when
old
age
approached
he
suddenly
found
himself
almost
penniless
somebody
recommended
him
to
betake
himself
to
his
country
seat
which
was
about
to
be
sold
by
public
auction
so
off
he
went
with
that
intention
but
called
in
at
mordasoff
and
stopped
there
six
months
he
liked
this
provincial
life
and
while
in
our
town
he
spent
every
farthing
he
had
left
in
the
world
continuing
his
reckless
life
as
of
old
galivanting
about
and
forming
intimacies
with
half
the
ladies
of
mordasoff
he
was
a
good
sort
of
a
man
but
of
course
not
without
certain
princely
failings
which
however
were
accounted
here
to
be
nothing
but
evidences
of
the
highest
breeding
and
for
this
reason
caused
a
good
effect
instead
of
aversion
the
ladies
especially
were
in
a
state
of
perpetual
ecstasy
over
their
dear
guest
they
cherished
the
fondest
and
tenderest
recollections
of
him
there
were
also
strange
traditions
and
rumours
about
the
prince
it
was
said
that
he
spent
more
than
half
the
day
at
his
toilet
table
and
that
he
was
in
fact
made
up
of
all
sorts
of
little
bits
no
one
could
say
when
or
how
he
had
managed
to
fall
to
pieces
so
completely
he
wore
a
wig
whiskers
moustache
and
even
an
espagnole
all
false
to
a
hair
and
of
a
lovely
raven
black
besides
which
he
painted
and
rouged
every
day
it
was
even
said
that
he
managed
to
do
away
with
his
wrinkles
by
means
of
somehow
in
his
wig
it
was
said
further
that
he
wore
stays
in
consequence
of
the
want
of
a
rib
which
he
had
lost
in
italy
through
being
caused
to
fly
involuntarily
out
of
a
window
during
a
certain
love
affair
he
limped
with
his
left
foot
and
it
was
whispered
that
the
said
foot
was
a
cork
very
scientific
member
made
for
him
in
place
of
the
real
one
which
came
to
grief
during
another
love
affair
in
paris
this
time
but
what
will
not
people
say
at
all
events
i
know
for
a
fact
that
his
right
eye
was
a
glass
one
beautifully
made
i
confess
but
his
teeth
were
false
too
for
whole
days
at
a
time
he
used
to
wash
himself
in
all
sorts
of
patent
waters
and
scents
and
pomades
however
no
one
could
deny
that
even
then
he
was
beginning
to
indulge
in
senile
drivel
and
chatter
it
appeared
his
career
was
about
over
he
had
seen
his
best
days
everyone
knew
that
he
had
not
a
copeck
left
in
the
world
then
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
an
old
relative
of
had
always
lived
in
paris
but
from
whom
he
never
had
had
the
slightest
hope
of
after
having
buried
her
legal
heir
exactly
a
month
before
the
prince
to
his
utter
astonishment
turned
out
to
be
the
next
heir
and
a
beautiful
property
of
four
thousand
serfs
just
forty
miles
from
mordasoff
became
and
unquestionably
he
immediately
started
off
to
petersburg
to
see
to
his
affairs
before
he
departed
however
the
ladies
of
our
town
gave
him
a
magnificent
subscription
banquet
they
tell
how
bewitching
and
delightful
the
prince
was
at
this
last
dinner
how
he
punned
and
joked
and
told
the
most
stories
and
how
he
promised
to
come
to
donchanovo
his
new
property
very
soon
and
gave
his
word
that
on
his
arrival
he
would
give
endless
balls
and
garden
parties
and
picnics
and
fireworks
and
entertainments
of
all
kinds
for
his
friends
here
for
a
whole
year
after
his
departure
the
ladies
of
the
place
talked
of
nothing
but
these
promised
festivities
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
dear
old
man
with
the
utmost
impatience
at
last
the
prince
arrived
but
to
the
disappointment
and
astonishment
of
everyone
he
did
not
even
call
in
at
mordasoff
on
the
way
and
on
his
arrival
at
donchanovo
he
shut
himself
up
there
as
i
have
expressed
it
before
like
a
very
hermit
all
sorts
of
fantastic
rumours
were
bruited
about
and
from
this
time
the
prince
s
life
and
history
became
most
secret
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
in
the
first
place
it
was
declared
that
the
prince
had
not
been
very
successful
in
petersburg
that
many
of
his
heirs
and
heirs
presumptive
and
so
on
had
wished
to
put
the
prince
under
some
kind
of
restraint
on
the
plea
of
feebleness
of
intellect
probably
fearing
that
he
would
run
through
this
property
as
he
had
done
with
the
last
and
more
some
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
he
should
be
popped
into
a
lunatic
asylum
and
he
was
only
saved
by
the
interference
of
one
of
the
nearest
of
kin
who
pointed
out
that
the
poor
old
prince
was
more
than
half
dead
already
and
that
the
rest
of
him
must
inevitably
soon
die
too
and
that
then
the
property
would
come
down
to
them
safely
enough
without
the
need
of
the
lunatic
asylum
i
repeat
what
will
not
people
say
especially
at
our
place
mordasoff
all
this
it
was
said
had
frightened
the
prince
dreadfully
so
that
his
nature
seemed
to
change
entirely
and
he
came
down
to
live
a
hermit
life
at
donchanovo
some
of
our
mordasoff
folk
went
over
to
welcome
him
on
his
arrival
but
they
were
either
not
received
at
all
or
received
in
the
strangest
fashion
the
prince
did
not
recognise
his
old
friends
many
people
explained
that
he
did
not
to
recognise
them
among
other
visitors
to
donchanovo
was
the
governor
on
the
return
of
the
latter
from
his
visit
he
declared
that
the
prince
was
undoubtedly
a
little
off
his
the
governor
always
made
a
face
if
anyone
reminded
him
of
this
visit
of
his
to
donchanovo
the
ladies
were
dreadfully
offended
at
last
an
important
fact
was
revealed
namely
that
there
was
with
the
prince
and
apparently
in
authority
over
him
some
unknown
person
of
the
name
of
stepanida
matveyevna
who
had
come
down
with
him
from
petersburg
an
elderly
fat
woman
in
a
calico
dress
who
went
about
with
the
in
her
hand
and
that
the
prince
obeyed
this
woman
like
a
little
child
and
did
not
dare
take
a
step
without
her
leave
that
she
washed
him
and
dressed
him
and
soothed
and
petted
him
just
like
a
nurse
with
a
baby
and
lastly
that
she
kept
all
visitors
away
from
him
even
little
by
little
had
begun
to
pervade
the
place
rather
too
frequently
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
that
all
was
right
it
was
said
that
this
person
managed
not
only
the
prince
but
his
estate
too
she
turned
off
bailiffs
and
clerks
she
encashed
the
rents
she
looked
after
things
in
did
it
well
too
so
that
the
peasants
blessed
their
fate
under
her
rule
as
for
the
prince
it
was
rumoured
that
he
spent
his
days
now
almost
entirely
at
his
trying
on
wigs
and
and
that
the
rest
of
his
time
was
spent
playing
cards
and
games
with
stepanida
matveyevna
and
riding
on
a
quiet
old
english
mare
on
such
occasions
his
nurse
always
accompanied
him
in
a
covered
droshky
because
the
prince
liked
to
ride
out
of
bravado
but
was
most
unsafe
in
his
saddle
he
had
been
seen
on
foot
too
in
a
long
great
coat
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
wide
brim
a
pink
silk
lady
s
tie
round
his
neck
and
a
basket
on
his
arm
for
mushrooms
and
flowers
and
berries
and
so
on
which
he
collected
the
nurse
accompanied
him
and
a
few
yards
behind
walked
a
manservant
while
a
carriage
was
in
attendance
on
the
high
road
at
the
side
when
any
peasant
happened
to
meet
him
and
with
low
bow
and
hat
in
hand
said
good
morning
your
beloved
sun
and
father
of
us
all
or
some
such
russian
greeting
he
would
stick
his
in
his
eye
nod
his
head
and
say
with
great
urbanity
and
in
french
bon
jour
mon
ami
bon
jour
lots
of
other
rumours
there
fact
our
folks
could
not
forget
that
the
prince
lived
so
near
them
what
then
must
have
been
the
general
amazement
when
one
fine
day
it
was
trumpeted
abroad
that
the
curious
old
had
arrived
at
mordasoff
and
put
up
at
maria
alexandrovna
s
house
agitation
and
bewilderment
were
the
order
of
the
day
everybody
waited
for
explanations
and
asked
one
another
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
mystery
some
proposed
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
all
agreed
that
it
was
extraordinary
the
ladies
wrote
notes
to
each
other
came
and
whispered
to
one
another
and
sent
their
maids
and
husbands
to
find
out
more
what
was
particularly
strange
was
why
had
the
prince
put
up
at
maria
alexandrovna
s
and
not
somewhere
else
this
fact
annoyed
everyone
but
most
of
all
antipova
who
happened
to
be
a
distant
relative
of
the
prince
however
in
order
to
clear
up
all
these
mysteries
and
find
an
answer
to
all
these
questions
we
must
ourselves
go
and
see
maria
alexandrovna
will
you
follow
me
in
kind
reader
it
is
only
ten
in
the
morning

but
i
daresay
she
will
receive
such
intimate
friends
all
the
same
oh
yes
she
ll
see
us
all
right
chapter
iii
it
is
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
we
are
at
maria
alexandrovna
s
and
in
that
room
which
the
mistress
calls
her
salon
on
great
occasions
she
has
a
boudoir
besides
in
this
salon
the
walls
are
prettily
papered
and
the
floor
is
nicely
painted
the
furniture
is
mostly
red
there
is
a
fireplace
and
on
the
mantelpiece
a
bronze
clock
with
some
it
in
dreadfully
bad
taste
there
are
large
between
the
windows
against
the
back
wall
there
stands
a
magnificent
grand
zina
is
a
musician
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
hisses
a
silver
with
a
very
pretty
alongside
of
it
there
is
a
lady
pouring
out
tea
a
distant
relative
of
the
family
and
living
with
maria
alexandrovna
in
that
capacity
one
nastasia
petrovna
ziablova
she
is
a
widow
of
over
thirty
a
brunette
with
a
face
and
lively
black
eyes
not
at
all
bad
looking
she
is
of
a
very
animated
disposition
laughs
a
great
deal
is
fond
of
scandal
of
course
and
can
manage
her
own
little
affairs
very
nicely
she
has
two
children
somewhere
being
educated
she
would
much
like
to
marry
again
her
last
husband
was
a
military
man
maria
alexandrovna
herself
is
sitting
at
the
fire
in
a
very
benign
frame
of
mind
she
is
dressed
in
a
dress
which
becomes
her
very
well
she
is
unspeakably
delighted
at
the
arrival
of
the
prince
who
at
this
moment
is
sitting
upstairs
at
his
toilet
table
she
is
so
happy
that
she
does
not
even
attempt
to
conceal
her
joy
a
young
man
is
standing
before
her
and
relating
something
in
an
animated
way
one
can
see
in
his
eyes
that
he
wishes
to
curry
favour
with
his
listener
this
young
fellow
is
about
years
old
and
his
manners
are
decidedly
good
though
he
has
a
silly
way
of
going
into
raptures
and
has
besides
a
good
deal
too
much
of
the
funny
man
about
him
he
is
well
dressed
and
his
hair
is
light
he
is
not
a
fellow
but
we
have
already
heard
of
this
gentleman
he
is
mosgliakoff
maria
alexandrovna
considers
him
rather
a
stupid
sort
of
a
man
but
receives
him
very
well
he
is
an
aspirant
for
the
hand
of
her
daughter
zina
whom
according
to
his
own
account
he
loves
to
distraction
in
his
conversation
he
refers
to
zina
every
other
minute
and
does
his
best
to
bring
a
smile
to
her
lips
by
his
witty
remarks
but
the
girl
is
evidently
very
cool
and
indifferent
with
him
at
this
moment
she
is
standing
away
at
the
side
near
the
piano
turning
over
the
leaves
of
some
book
this
girl
is
one
of
those
women
who
create
a
sensation
amounting
almost
to
amazement
when
they
appear
in
society
she
is
lovely
to
an
almost
impossible
extent
a
brunette
with
splendid
black
eyes
a
grand
figure
and
divine
bust
her
shoulders
and
arms
are
like
an
antique
statue
her
gait
that
of
an
empress
she
is
a
little
pale
but
her
lips
with
the
gleam
of
her
pearly
teeth
between
them
are
things
to
dream
of
if
you
once
get
a
sight
of
them
her
expression
is
severe
and
serious
mosgliakoff
is
evidently
afraid
of
her
intent
gaze
at
all
events
he
seems
to
cower
before
her
when
she
looks
at
him
she
is
very
simply
dressed
in
a
white
muslin
white
suits
her
admirably
but
then
suits
her
on
her
finger
is
a
hair
ring
it
does
not
look
as
though
the
hair
was
her
mother
s
from
the
colour
mosgliakoff
has
never
dared
to
ask
her
whose
hair
it
is
this
morning
she
seems
to
be
in
a
peculiarly
depressed
humour
she
appears
to
be
very
much
preoccupied
and
silent
but
her
mother
is
quite
ready
to
talk
enough
for
both
albeit
she
glances
continually
at
zina
as
though
anxious
for
her
but
timidly
too
as
if
afraid
of
her
i
am
pleased
pavel
alexandrovitch
she
chirps
to
mosgliakoff
happy
that
i
feel
inclined
to
cry
the
news
out
of
the
window
to
every
not
to
speak
of
the
delightful
both
zina
and
seeing
you
a
whole
fortnight
sooner
than
we
expected
of
course
goes
without
saying
but
i
am
so
pleased
that
you
should
have
brought
this
dear
prince
with
you
you
don
t
know
how
i
love
that
fascinating
old
man
no
no
you
would
never
believe
it
you
young
people
don
t
understand
this
sort
of
rapture
you
never
would
believe
me
assure
you
as
much
as
ever
i
pleased
don
t
you
remember
zina
how
much
he
was
to
me
at
that
years
ago
why
i
was
his
guide
his
sister
his
mother
there
was
something
delightfully
ingenuous
and
ennobling
in
our
might
say
i
don
t
know
what
to
call
was
delightful
that
is
why
the
poor
dear
prince
thinks
of
house
and
only
mine
with
gratitude
now
do
you
know
pavel
alexandrovitch
perhaps
you
have
him
by
thus
bringing
him
to
me
i
have
thought
of
him
with
quaking
of
heart
all
these
six
d
hardly
believe
it
of
him
too
they
say
that
wretch
of
a
woman
has
bewitched
and
ruined
him
but
you
ve
got
him
out
of
the
net
at
last
we
must
make
the
best
of
our
opportunity
now
and
save
him
outright
do
tell
me
again
how
did
you
manage
it
describe
your
meeting
and
all
in
detail
i
only
heard
the
chief
point
of
the
story
just
now
and
i
do
so
like
details
so
he
s
still
at
his
toilet
table
now
is
he
yes
it
was
all
just
as
i
told
you
maria
alexandrovna
begins
mosgliakoff
to
repeat
his
story
ten
times
over
if
i
had
driven
all
night
and
not
slept
a
wink
you
can
imagine
what
a
hurry
i
was
in
to
arrive
here

to

a
word

going
to
get
i
frightened
the
man
s
wife
out
of
her
wits
she
had
a
small
baby
in
her
arms
and
i
have
an
idea
that
its
mother
s
fright
will
affect
said
baby
s
supply
of
the
needful
well
the
sunrise
was
frosty
but
i
hadn
t
time
to
look
at
anything
i
got
my
had
to
deprive
some
other
traveller
of
his
pair
he
was
a
professor
and
we
nearly
fought
a
duel
about
it
they
told
me
some
prince
had
driven
off
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
he
had
slept
here
and
was
driving
his
own
horses
but
i
didn
t
attend
to
anything
well
just
seven
miles
from
town
at
a
turn
of
the
road
i
saw
that
some
surprising
event
had
happened
a
huge
travelling
carriage
was
lying
on
its
side
the
coachman
and
two
flunkeys
stood
outside
it
apparently
dazed
while
from
inside
the
carriage
came
lamentations
and
cries
i
thought
i
d
pass
by
and
let
them
all
it
was
no
affair
of
mine
but
humanity
insisted
and
would
not
take
a
denial
i
think
it
is
heine
says
that
humanity
shoves
its
nose
in
everywhere
so
i
stopped
and
my
driver
and
myself
with
the
other
fellows
lifted
the
carriage
on
to
its
legs
again
or
perhaps
i
should
say
wheels
as
it
had
no
legs
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
that
very
prince
they
mentioned
so
i
looked
in
good
heavens
it
was
our
prince
here
was
a
meeting
if
you
like
i
yelled
at
him
of
course
he
hardly
knew
me
at
the
first
glance
but
he
very
soon
recognised
me
at
least
i
don
t
believe
he
knows
who
i
am
really
even
i
think
he
takes
me
for
someone
else
not
a
relation
i
saw
him
last
seven
years
ago
as
a
boy
i
remember
because
he
struck
me
so
but
how
was
he
to
remember
at
all
events
i
told
him
my
name
and
he
embraced
me
ecstatically
and
all
the
while
he
himself
was
crying
and
trembling
with
fright
he
really
was
i
ll
take
my
oath
he
was
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
well
we
talked
a
bit
and
at
last
i
persuaded
him
to
get
into
my
trap
with
me
and
call
in
at
mordasoff
if
only
for
one
day
to
rest
and
compose
his
feelings
he
told
me
that
stepanida
matveyevna
had
had
a
letter
from
moscow
saying
that
her
father
or
daughter
or
both
with
all
her
family
were
dying
and
that
she
had
wavered
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
determined
to
go
away
for
ten
days
the
prince
sat
out
one
day
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
measuring
wigs
and
powdering
and
pomading
himself
then
he
grew
sick
of
it
and
determined
to
go
and
see
an
old
friend
a
priest
called
misael
who
lived
at
the
svetozersk
hermitage
some
of
the
household
being
afraid
of
the
great
stepanida
s
wrath
opposed
the
prince
s
proposed
journey
but
the
latter
insisted
and
started
last
night
after
dinner
he
slept
at
igishova
and
went
off
this
morning
again
at
sunrise
just
at
the
turn
going
down
to
the
reverend
misael
s
the
carriage
went
over
and
the
prince
was
very
nearly
shot
down
the
then
i
step
in
and
save
the
prince
and
persuade
him
to
come
and
pay
a
visit
to
our
mutual
friend
maria
alexandrovna
of
whom
the
prince
told
me
that
she
is
the
most
delightful
and
charming
woman
he
has
ever
known
and
so
here
we
are
and
the
prince
is
now
upstairs
attending
to
his
wigs
and
so
on
with
the
help
of
his
valet
whom
he
took
along
with
him
and
whom
he
always
would
and
will
take
with
him
wherever
he
goes
because
he
would
sooner
die
than
appear
before
ladies
without
certain
little
secret
touches
which
require
the
valet
s
hand
there
you
are
that
s
the
whole
why
what
a
humourist
he
is
isn
t
he
zina
said
the
lady
of
the
house
how
beautifully
you
told
the
story
now
listen
paul
one
question
explain
to
me
clearly
how
you
are
related
to
the
prince
you
call
him
uncle
i
really
don
t
know
maria
alexandrovna
seventh
cousin
i
think
or
something
of
that
sort
my
aunt
knows
all
about
it
it
was
she
who
made
me
go
down
to
see
him
at
donchanova
when
i
got
kicked
out
by
stepanida
i
simply
call
him
uncle
and
he
answers
me
that
s
about
all
our
well
i
repeat
it
was
providence
that
made
you
bring
him
straight
to
my
house
as
you
did
i
tremble
to
think
of
what
might
have
happened
to
the
poor
dear
prince
if
somebody
else
and
not
i
had
got
hold
of
him
why
they
d
have
torn
him
to
pieces
among
them
and
picked
his
bones
they
d
have
pounced
on
him
as
on
a
mine
they
might
easily
have
robbed
him
they
are
capable
of
it
you
have
no
idea
paul
of
the
depth
of
meanness
and
greediness
to
which
the
people
of
this
place
have
fallen
but
my
dear
good
maria
if
he
would
ever
of
bringing
him
anywhere
but
to
yourself
said
the
widow
pouring
out
a
cup
of
tea
you
don
t
suppose
he
would
have
taken
the
prince
to
antipova
s
surely
do
you
dear
me
how
very
long
he
is
coming
out
said
maria
alexandrovna
impatiently
rising
from
her
chair
it
really
is
quite
strange
strange
what
of
uncle
oh
dear
no
he
ll
probably
be
another
five
hours
or
so
putting
himself
together
besides
since
he
has
no
memory
whatever
he
has
very
likely
quite
forgotten
that
he
has
come
to
your
house
why
he
s
a
most
extraordinary
man
maria
oh
don
t
don
t
don
t
talk
like
that
why
not
maria
alexandrovna
he
is
a
lump
of
composition
not
a
man
at
all
remember
you
haven
t
seen
him
for
six
years
and
i
saw
him
half
an
hour
ago
he
is
half
a
corpse
he
s
only
the
memory
of
a
man
they
ve
forgotten
to
bury
him
why
his
eye
is
made
of
glass
and
his
leg
of
cork
and
he
goes
on
wires
he
even
talks
on
wires
maria
alexandrovna
s
face
took
a
serious
expression
what
nonsense
you
talk
she
said
and
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
you
a
young
man
and
a
relation
talk
like
that
of
a
most
honourable
old
nobleman
not
to
mention
his
incomparable
personal
goodness
and
kindness
her
voice
here
trembled
with
emotion
he
is
a
relic
a
chip
so
to
speak
of
our
old
aristocracy
i
know
my
dear
young
friend
that
all
this
flightiness
on
your
part
proceeds
from
those
new
ideas
of
which
you
are
so
fond
of
talking
but
goodness
me
i
ve
seen
a
good
deal
more
of
life
than
you
have
i
m
a
mother
and
though
i
see
the
greatness
and
nobleness
if
you
like
of
these
new
ideas
yet
i
can
understand
the
practical
side
of
things
too
now
this
gentleman
is
an
old
man
and
that
is
quite
enough
to
render
him
ridiculous
in
your
eyes
you
who
talk
of
emancipating
your
serfs
and
doing
something
for
posterity
indeed
i
tell
you
what
it
is
it
s
your
shakespeare
you
stuff
yourself
full
of
shakespeare
who
has
long
ago
outlived
his
time
my
dear
paul
and
who
if
he
lived
now
with
all
his
wisdom
would
never
make
head
or
tail
of
our
way
of
life
if
there
be
any
chivalry
left
in
our
modern
society
it
is
only
in
the
highest
circles
of
the
aristocracy
a
prince
is
a
prince
either
in
a
hovel
or
in
a
palace
are
more
or
less
a
representative
of
the
highest
circles
your
extraction
is
aristocratic
i
too
am
not
altogether
a
stranger
to
the
upper
ten
and
it
s
a
bad
fledgling
that
fouls
its
own
nest
however
my
dear
paul
you
ll
forget
your
shakespeare
yet
and
you
ll
understand
all
this
much
better
than
i
can
explain
it
i
foresee
it
besides
i
m
sure
you
are
only
joking
you
did
not
mean
what
you
said
stay
here
dear
paul
will
you
i
m
just
going
upstairs
to
make
inquiries
after
the
prince
he
may
want
and
maria
alexandrovna
left
the
room
hurriedly
maria
alexandrovna
seems
highly
delighted
that
antipova
who
thinks
so
much
of
herself
did
not
get
hold
of
the
prince
remarked
the
widow
mrs
antipova
must
be
gnashing
her
teeth
with
annoyance
just
now
she
s
a
relation
too
as
i
ve
been
pointing
out
to
maria
observing
that
no
one
answered
her
and
casting
her
eyes
on
zina
and
mosgliakoff
the
widow
suddenly
recollected
herself
and
discreetly
left
the
room
as
though
to
fetch
something
however
she
rewarded
herself
for
her
discretion
by
putting
her
ear
to
the
keyhole
as
soon
as
she
had
closed
the
door
after
her
pavel
alexandrovitch
immediately
turned
to
zina
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
his
voice
shook
zenaida
afanassievna
are
you
angry
with
me
he
began
in
a
timid
beseechful
tone
with
you
why
asked
zina
blushing
a
little
and
raising
her
magnificent
eyes
to
his
face
for
coming
earlier
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
couldn
t
wait
another
fortnight
i
dreamed
of
you
every
night
so
i
flew
off
to
learn
my
fate
but
you
are
frowning
you
are
angry
am
i
really
not
to
hear
anything
definite
even
now
zina
distinctly
and
decidedly
frowned
i
supposed
you
would
speak
of
this
she
said
with
her
eyes
drooped
again
but
with
a
firm
and
severe
voice
in
which
some
annoyance
was
perceptible
and
as
the
expectation
of
it
was
very
tedious
the
sooner
you
had
your
say
the
better
you
insist
upon
an
answer
again
do
you
very
well
i
say
just
as
i
said
it
before
i
now
repeat
as
i
did
then
that
i
have
not
as
yet
decided
and
can
not
therefore
promise
to
be
your
wife
you
can
not
force
a
girl
to
such
a
decision
pavel
alexandrovitch
however
to
relieve
your
mind
i
will
add
that
i
do
not
as
yet
refuse
you
absolutely
and
pray
observe
that
i
give
you
thus
much
hope
of
a
favourable
reply
merely
out
of
forced
deference
to
your
impatience
and
agitation
and
that
if
i
think
fit
afterwards
to
reject
you
altogether
you
are
not
to
blame
me
for
having
given
you
false
hopes
so
now
you
oh
s
the
use
of
that
what
hope
am
i
to
get
out
of
that
zina
cried
mosgliakoff
in
piteous
tones
recollect
what
i
have
said
and
draw
whatever
you
please
from
the
words
that
s
your
business
i
shall
add
nothing
i
do
not
refuse
you
i
merely
and
i
repeat
i
reserve
the
free
right
of
rejecting
you
afterwards
if
i
choose
so
to
do
just
one
more
word
if
you
come
here
before
the
fixed
time
relying
on
outside
protection
or
even
on
my
mother
s
influence
to
help
you
gain
your
end
let
me
tell
you
you
make
a
great
mistake
if
you
worry
me
now
i
shall
refuse
you
outright
i
hope
we
understand
each
other
now
and
that
i
shall
hear
no
more
of
this
until
the
period
i
named
to
you
for
my
all
this
was
said
quietly
and
drily
and
without
a
pause
as
if
learnt
by
rote
paul
felt
foolish
but
just
at
this
moment
maria
alexandrovna
entered
the
room
and
the
widow
after
her
i
think
he
s
just
coming
zina
nastasia
petrovna
make
some
new
tea
quick
please
the
good
lady
was
considerably
agitated
mrs
antipova
has
sent
her
maid
over
to
inquire
about
the
prince
already
how
angry
she
must
be
feeling
just
now
remarked
the
widow
as
she
commenced
to
pass
over
the
and
what
s
that
to
me
replied
maria
alexandrovna
over
her
shoulder
just
as
though
care
what
she
thinks
shall
not
send
a
maid
to
her
kitchen
to
inquire
i
assure
you
and
i
am
surprised
downright
that
not
only
you
but
all
the
town
too
should
suppose
that
that
wretched
woman
is
my
enemy
i
appeal
to
you
know
us
both
why
should
i
be
her
enemy
now
is
it
a
question
of
precedence
pooh
i
don
t
care
about
precedence
she
may
be
first
if
she
likes
and
i
shall
be
readiest
of
all
to
go
and
congratulate
her
on
the
fact
besides
it
s
all
nonsense
why
i
take
her
part
i
take
her
part
people
malign
her
do
you
all
fall
upon
her
so
because
she
s
young
and
likes
to
be
smart
is
that
it
dear
me
i
think
finery
is
a
good
bit
better
than
some
other
natalia
dimitrievna
s
for
instance
who
has
a
taste
for
things
that
can
not
be
mentioned
in
polite
society
or
is
it
that
antipova
goes
out
too
much
and
never
stays
at
home
my
goodness
why
the
woman
has
never
had
any
education
naturally
she
doesn
t
care
to
sit
down
to
read
or
anything
of
that
sort
true
she
coquets
and
makes
eyes
at
everybody
who
looks
at
her
but
why
do
people
tell
her
that
she
s
pretty
especially
as
she
only
has
a
pale
face
and
nothing
else
to
boast
of
she
is
amusing
at
a
dance
i
admit
but
why
do
people
tell
her
that
she
dances
the
polka
so
well
she
wears
hideous
hats
and
things
but
it
s
not
her
fault
that
nature
gave
her
no
gift
of
good
taste
she
talks
scandal
but
that
s
the
custom
of
the
doesn
t
here
that
fellow
sushikoff
with
his
whiskers
goes
to
see
her
pretty
often
while
her
husband
plays
cards
but
that
be
merely
a
tale
at
all
events
i
always
say
so
and
take
her
part
in
every
way
but
good
heavens
here
s
the
prince
at
last
tis
he
tis
he
i
recognise
him
i
should
know
him
out
of
a
thousand
at
last
i
see
you
at
last
my
prince
cried
maria
alexandrovna
she
rushed
to
greet
the
prince
as
he
entered
the
room
chapter
iv
at
first
sight
you
would
not
take
this
prince
for
an
old
man
at
all
and
it
is
only
when
you
come
near
and
take
a
good
look
at
him
that
you
see
he
is
merely
a
dead
man
working
on
wires
all
the
resources
of
science
are
brought
to
bear
upon
this
mummy
in
order
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
life
and
youth
a
marvellous
wig
glorious
whiskers
moustache
and
of
the
most
raven
half
his
face
he
is
painted
and
powdered
with
very
great
skill
so
much
so
that
one
can
hardly
detect
any
wrinkles
what
has
become
of
them
goodness
only
knows
he
is
dressed
in
the
pink
of
fashion
just
as
though
he
had
walked
straight
out
of
a
tailor
s
his
coat
his
gloves
tie
his
waistcoat
his
linen
are
all
in
perfect
taste
and
in
the
very
last
mode
the
prince
limps
slightly
but
so
slightly
that
one
would
suppose
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
was
in
fashion
too
in
his
eye
he
wears
a
the
eye
which
is
itself
glass
already
he
was
soaked
with
scent
his
speech
and
manner
of
pronouncing
certain
syllables
was
full
of
affectation
and
this
was
perhaps
all
that
he
retained
of
the
mannerisms
and
tricks
of
his
younger
days
for
if
the
prince
had
not
quite
lost
his
wits
as
yet
he
had
certainly
parted
with
nearly
every
vestige
of
his
memory
a
thing
which
no
amount
of
perfumeries
and
wigs
and
rouge
and
will
renovate
he
continually
forgets
words
in
the
midst
of
conversation
and
loses
his
way
which
makes
it
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
him
however
maria
alexandrovna
has
confidence
in
her
inborn
dexterity
and
at
sight
of
the
prince
she
flies
into
a
condition
of
unspeakable
rapture
oh
but
you
ve
not
changed

with
a
bitter
smile

maria

the
old
man
staring
at
zina
that

my
daughter
zina

not

prince
she
wasn
t
here
when

were
last

the
old
man
staring
hungrily
at
zina
through
his
glasses
dear

dear
me
but
what
a
girl
he
added
evidently
impressed
tea
prince
remarked
maria
alexandrovna
directing
his
attention
to
the
page
standing
before
him
with
the
tray
the
prince
took
a
cup
and
examined
the
boy
who
had
a
nice
fresh
face
of
his
own
ah
this
is
your
boy
a
charming
little
and
does
he
nicely
but
prince
interrupted
maria
alexandrovna
impatiently
what
is
this
dreadful
occurrence
i
hear
of
i
confess
i
was
nearly
beside
myself
with
terror
when
i
heard
of
it
were
you
not
hurt
at
all
take
care
one
can
not
make
light
of
this
sort
of
upset
upset
the
upset
me
cried
the
prince
with
unwonted
vivacity
i
thought
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
and
i
was
out
of
my
wits
i
didn
t
expect
it
i
didn
t
indeed
and
my
is
to
blame
for
it
all
i
trust
you
my
friend
to
into
the
matter
well
i
feel
sure
he
was
making
an
attempt
on
my
life
all
right
all
right
uncle
said
paul
i
ll
see
about
it
but
look
him
just
this
once
uncle
just
this
once
won
t
you
i
not
for
anything
i
m
sure
he
wants
my
life
he
and
lavrenty
too
it
s
the
new
ideas
it
s
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
i
daren
t
meet
them
you
are
right
you
are
quite
right
prince
cried
maria
alexandrovna
you
don
t
know
how
i
suffer
myself
from
these
wretched
people
i
ve
just
been
obliged
to
change
two
of
my
servants
and
you
ve
no
idea
how
they
are
quite
so
said
the
prince
all
old
men
are
whose
senile
chatter
is
listened
to
with
servility
but
i
like
a
to
look
stupid
it
gives
them
presence
there
s
my
terenty
now
you
remember
terenty
my
friend
well
the
time
i
ever
looked
at
him
i
said
you
shall
be
my
he
s
stupid
stupid
he
looks
like
a
but
his
and
majesty
are
wonderful
when
i
look
at
him
he
seems
to
be
composing
some
he
s
just
like
the
german
philosopher
kant
or
like
some
old
turkey
and
that
s
just
what
one
wants
in
a
maria
alexandrovna
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
in
the
highest
state
of
ecstasy
paul
supported
her
with
all
his
might
nastasia
petrovna
laughed
too
and
even
zina
smiled
but
prince
how
clever
how
witty
how
you
are
cried
maria
alexandrovna
what
a
wonderful
gilt
of
remarking
the
smallest
refinements
of
character
and
for
a
man
like
you
to
eschew
all
society
and
shut
yourself
up
for
five
years
with
such
talents
why
prince
you
could
you
could
be
an
author
you
could
emulate
von
vezin
gribojedoff
gogol
said
the
delighted
prince
i
can
reproduce
things
i
see
very
well
and
do
you
know
i
used
to
be
a
very
fellow
indeed
some
time
ago
i
even
wrote
a
play
once
there
were
some
very
smart
couplets
i
remember
but
it
was
never
oh
how
nice
it
would
be
to
read
it
over
especially
just
eh
zina
for
we
are
thinking
of
getting
up
a
play
you
must
know
prince
for
the
benefit
of
the
martyrs
of
the
fatherland
the
wounded
soldiers
there
now
how
handy
your
play
would
come
in
certainly
certainly
would
even
write
you
another
i
think
i
ve
quite
forgotten
the
old
one
i
remember
there
were
two
or
three
such
epigrams
that
here
the
prince
kissed
his
own
hand
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
exquisite
wit
of
his
lines
i
recollect
when
i
was
abroad
i
made
a
real
furore
i
remember
lord
byron
well
we
were
great
friends
you
should
have
seen
him
dance
the
mazurka
one
day
during
the
vienna
lord
byron
uncle
not
lord
byron
perhaps
it
was
not
lord
byron
though
perhaps
it
was
someone
else
no
it
wasn
t
lord
byron
it
was
some
pole
i
remember
now
a
fellow
that
pole
was
he
said
he
was
a
and
he
turned
out
to
be
a
man
but
he
danced
the
mazurka
and
broke
his
leg
at
last
i
recollect
i
wrote
some
lines
at
the
time
our
little
pole
danced
like
did
it
go
on
now
wait
a
minute
no
i
can
t
i
ll
tell
you
uncle
it
must
have
been
like
this
said
paul
becoming
more
and
more
inspired
but
he
tripped
in
a
hole
which
stopped
his
that
was
it
i
think
or
something
very
like
it
i
don
t
know
it
wasn
t
anyhow
the
lines
were
very
i
forget
a
good
deal
of
what
i
have
seen
and
done
i
m
so
now
but
do
let
me
hear
how
you
have
employed
your
time
in
your
solitude
dear
prince
said
maria
alexandrovna
i
must
confess
that
i
have
thought
of
you
so
often
and
often
that
i
am
burning
with
impatience
to
hear
more
about
you
and
your
employed
my
time
oh
very
busy
very
busy
one
rests
you
see
part
of
the
day
and
then
i
imagine
a
good
many
i
should
think
you
have
a
very
strong
imagination
haven
t
you
uncle
remarked
paul
exceptionally
so
my
dear
fellow
i
sometimes
imagine
things
which
amaze
even
myself
when
i
was
at
kadueff
you
were
of
kadueff
weren
t
you
i
uncle
why
what
are
you
thinking
of
no
just
fancy
my
dear
fellow
and
i
ve
been
thinking
all
this
time
how
that
the
of
kadueff
should
be
here
with
quite
a
different
face
he
had
a
fine
intelligent
face
you
know
a
fellow
always
writing
verses
too
he
was
rather
like
the
of
diamonds
from
the
side
view
no
prince
interrupted
maria
alexandrovna
i
assure
you
you
ll
ruin
yourself
with
the
life
you
are
leading
to
make
a
hermit
of
oneself
for
five
years
and
see
no
one
and
hear
no
one
you
re
a
lost
man
dear
prince
ask
any
one
of
those
who
love
you
they
ll
all
tell
you
the
same
you
re
a
lost
man
no
cried
the
prince
really
yes
i
assure
you
of
it
i
am
speaking
to
you
as
a
a
friend
i
am
telling
you
this
because
you
are
very
dear
to
me
and
because
the
memory
of
the
past
is
sacred
to
me
no
no
you
must
change
your
way
of
living
otherwise
you
will
fall
ill
and
break
up
and
die
gracious
heavens
surely
i
shan
t
so
soon
cried
the
old
man
are
right
about
being
ill
i
am
ill
now
and
then
i
ll
tell
you
all
the
i
ll
them
to
you
firstly
uncle
don
t
you
think
you
had
better
tell
us
all
about
it
another
day
paul
interrupted
hurriedly
i
think
we
had
better
be
starting
just
now
don
t
you
perhaps
perhaps
but
remind
me
to
tell
you
another
time
it
s
a
most
interesting
case
i
assure
you
but
listen
my
dear
prince
maria
alexandrovna
resumed
why
don
t
you
try
being
doctored
abroad
yes
shall
certainly
go
abroad
i
remember
when
i
was
abroad
about
it
was
delightfully
and
jolly
i
very
nearly
married
a
a
french
woman
i
was
fearfully
in
love
but
else
married
her
not
i
it
was
a
very
thing
i
had
only
gone
away
for
a
of
hours
and
this
baron
fellow
came
and
carried
her
off
he
went
into
a
afterwards
yes
dear
prince
you
must
look
after
your
health
there
are
such
good
doctors
abroad
the
mere
change
of
life
what
will
not
that
alone
do
for
you
you
desert
your
dear
donchanovo
if
only
for
a
time
certainly
i
ve
long
meant
to
do
it
i
m
going
to
try
hydropathy
yes
i
ve
tried
it
once
before
i
was
abroad
you
know
and
they
persuaded
me
to
try
drinking
the
there
wasn
t
anything
the
matter
with
me
but
i
agreed
just
out
of
for
their
feelings
and
i
did
seem
to
feel
easier
somehow
so
i
drank
and
drank
and
up
a
whole
waterfall
and
i
assure
you
if
i
hadn
t
fallen
ill
just
then
i
should
have
been
quite
well
to
the
water
but
i
confess
you
ve
frightened
me
so
about
these
and
things
i
feel
quite
put
out
i
ll
come
back
why
prince
where
are
you
off
to
asked
maria
alexandrovna
in
surprise
directly
directly
i
m
just
going
to
note
down
an
what
sort
of
idea
cried
paul
bursting
with
laughter
maria
alexandrovna
lost
all
patience
i
can
not
understand
what
you
find
to
laugh
at
she
cried
as
the
old
man
disappeared
to
laugh
at
an
honourable
old
man
and
turn
every
word
of
his
into
on
his
angelic
good
nature
i
assure
you
i
for
you
paul
alexandrovitch
why
what
do
you
see
in
him
to
laugh
at
i
never
saw
anything
funny
about
him
well
i
laugh
because
he
does
not
recognise
people
and
talks
such
nonsense
that
s
simply
the
result
of
his
sad
life
of
his
dreadful
five
years
captivity
under
the
guardianship
of
that
you
should
not
laugh
at
him
he
did
not
even
know
you
saw
it
yourself
i
tell
you
it
s
a
crying
shame
he
must
be
saved
at
all
costs
i
recommend
him
to
go
abroad
so
that
he
may
get
out
of
the
clutches
of
of
a
woman
do
you
know
must
find
him
a
wife
cried
paul
oh
mosgliakoff
you
are
too
bad
you
really
are
too
bad
no
no
maria
alexandrovna
i
assure
you
this
time
i
m
speaking
in
all
seriousness
why
marry
him
off
isn
t
it
rather
a
brilliant
idea
what
harm
can
marriage
do
him
on
the
contrary
he
is
in
that
position
that
such
a
step
alone
can
save
him
in
the
first
place
he
will
get
rid
of
that
fox
of
a
woman
and
secondly
he
may
find
some
girl
or
better
still
some
good
wise
and
gentle
and
poor
who
will
look
after
him
as
his
own
daughter
would
and
who
will
be
sensible
of
the
honour
he
does
her
in
making
her
his
wife
and
what
could
be
better
for
the
old
fellow
than
to
have
such
a
person
about
him
rather
than
he
has
now
of
course
she
must
be
for
uncle
appreciates
good
looks
didn
t
you
observe
how
he
stared
at
miss
zina
but
how
will
you
find
him
such
a
bride
asked
nastasia
petrovna
who
had
listened
intently
to
paul
s
suggestion
what
a
question
why
you
yourself
if
you
pleased
and
why
not
pray
in
the
first
place
you
are
you
are
a
widow
you
are
generous
you
are
poor
at
least
i
don
t
think
you
are
very
rich
then
you
are
a
very
reasonable
woman
you
ll
learn
to
love
him
and
take
good
care
of
him
you
ll
send
that
other
woman
to
the
deuce
and
take
your
husband
abroad
where
you
will
feed
him
on
pudding
and
lollipops
till
the
moment
of
his
quitting
this
wicked
world
which
will
be
in
about
a
year
or
in
a
couple
of
months
perhaps
after
that
you
emerge
a
princess
a
rich
widow
and
as
a
prize
for
your
goodness
to
the
old
gentleman
you
ll
marry
a
fine
young
marquis
or
a
or
somebody
of
the
sort
s
a
pretty
enough
prospect
isn
t
it
tfu
goodness
me
i
should
fall
in
love
with
him
at
once
out
of
pure
gratitude
if
he
only
proposed
to
me
said
the
widow
with
her
black
eyes
all
ablaze
but
of
course
it
s
all
nonsense
nonsense
is
it
shall
i
make
it
sound
sense
then
for
you
ask
me
prettily
and
if
i
don
t
make
you
his
betrothed
by
this
evening
you
may
cut
my
little
finger
off
why
there
s
nothing
in
the
world
easier
than
to
talk
uncle
into
anything
you
please
he
ll
only
say
just
as
you
heard
him
now
we
ll
marry
him
so
that
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
it
if
you
like
we
ll
deceive
him
and
marry
him
if
you
please
any
way
you
like
it
can
be
done
why
it
s
for
his
own
good
it
s
out
of
pity
for
himself
don
t
you
think
seriously
nastasia
petrovna
that
you
had
better
put
on
some
smart
clothes
in
any
case
paul
s
enthusiasm
amounted
by
now
to
something
like
madness
while
the
widow
s
mouth
watered
at
his
idea
in
spite
of
her
better
judgment
i
know
i
know
i
look
horridly
untidy
she
said
i
go
about
anyhow
nowadays
there
s
nothing
to
dress
for
do
i
really
look
like
a
regular
cook
all
this
time
maria
alexandrovna
sat
still
with
a
strange
expression
on
her
face
i
shall
not
be
far
wrong
if
i
say
that
she
listened
to
paul
s
wild
suggestion
with
a
look
of
terror
almost
she
was
confused
and
startled
at
last
she
recollected
herself
and
spoke
all
this
is
very
nice
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
utter
nonsense
and
perfectly
out
of
the
question
she
observed
cuttingly
why
why
my
good
maria
alexandrovna
why
is
it
such
nonsense
or
why
out
of
the
question
for
many
reasons
and
principally
because
you
are
as
the
prince
is
also
a
guest
in
my
house
and
i
can
not
permit
anyone
to
forget
their
respect
towards
my
establishment
i
shall
consider
your
words
as
a
joke
paul
alexandrovitch
and
nothing
more
here
comes
the
goodness
here
i
am
cried
the
old
man
as
he
entered
it
s
a
thing
how
many
good
ideas
of
all
i
m
having
and
another
day
i
may
spend
the
whole
of
it
without
a
single
one
not
one
all
day
probably
the
result
of
your
accident
uncle
your
nerves
got
shaken
up
you
see
and
i
think
so
i
think
so
too
and
i
look
on
the
accident
as
on
the
whole
and
therefore
i
m
going
to
excuse
the
coachman
i
don
t
think
it
was
an
on
my
life
after
all
do
you
besides
he
was
punished
a
little
while
when
his
beard
was
off
beard
shaved
off
why
uncle
his
beard
is
as
big
as
a
german
state
a
german
state
you
are
very
happy
in
your
my
boy
but
it
s
a
one
fancy
what
happened
i
sent
for
a
for
false
hair
and
beards
and
found
advertisements
for
splendid
and
coachmen
s
beards
very
so
i
sent
for
one
and
it
certainly
was
a
but
when
we
wanted
to
clap
it
on
the
coachman
we
found
he
had
one
of
his
own
as
big
so
i
thought
shall
i
cut
off
his
or
let
him
wear
it
and
send
this
one
and
i
decided
to
shave
his
off
and
let
him
wear
the
one
on
the
theory
that
art
is
higher
than
nature
i
suppose
uncle
yes
yes
just
i
assure
you
when
we
cut
off
his
beard
he
suffered
as
much
as
though
we
were
depriving
him
of
all
he
held
most
dear
but
we
must
be
my
boy
but
i
hope
dear
prince
that
you
will
only
call
upon
the
governor
cried
maria
alexandrovna
in
great
agitation
you
are
now
prince
you
belong
to
family
for
the
whole
of
this
day
of
course
i
will
say
nothing
about
the
society
of
this
place
perhaps
you
are
thinking
of
paying
anna
nicolaevna
a
visit
i
will
not
say
a
word
to
dissuade
you
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
quite
convinced
will
show
remember
one
thing
dear
prince
that
i
am
your
sister
your
nurse
your
guardian
for
at
least
and
oh
tremble
for
you
you
don
t
know
these
people
prince
as
i
do
you
don
t
know
them
fully
but
time
will
teach
you
all
you
do
not
trust
me
maria
alexandrovna
said
paul
it
shall
all
be
exactly
as
i
have
promised
you
you
re
such
a
weathercock
i
can
never
trust
i
shall
wait
for
you
at
dinner
time
prince
we
dine
early
how
sorry
i
am
that
my
husband
happens
to
be
in
the
country
on
such
an
occasion
how
happy
he
would
have
been
to
see
you
he
esteems
you
so
highly
prince
he
is
so
sincerely
attached
to
you
your
husband
dear
me
so
you
have
a
too
observed
the
old
man
oh
prince
prince
how
forgetful
you
are
why
you
have
quite
forgotten
the
past
my
husband
afanassy
matveyevitch
surely
you
must
remember
him
he
is
in
the
country
but
you
have
seen
him
thousands
of
times
before
don
t
you
matveyevitch
afanassy
matveyevitch
dear
me
in
the
how
very
charming
so
you
have
a
husband
dear
me
i
remember
a
vaudeville
very
like
that
something
the
husband
s
here
and
his
wife
at
charming
a
good
rhyme
too
and
it
s
a
most
story
charming
charming
the
wife
s
away
you
know
at
jaroslaf
or
or
somewhere
and
the
husband
me
i
m
afraid
i
ve
forgotten
what
we
were
talking
about
yes
must
be
going
my
boy
revoir
madame
adieu
ma
charmante
he
added
turning
to
zina
and
putting
the
ends
of
her
fingers
to
his
lips
come
back
to
dinner
dinner
prince
don
t
forget
to
come
back
here
quick
cried
maria
alexandrovna
after
them
as
they
went
out
be
back
to
dinner
chapter
nastasia
petrovna
i
think
you
had
better
go
and
see
what
is
doing
in
the
kitchen
observed
maria
alexandrovna
as
she
returned
from
seeing
the
prince
off
i
m
sure
that
rascal
nikitka
will
spoil
the
dinner
probably
he
s
drunk
already
the
widow
obeyed
as
the
latter
left
the
room
she
glanced
suspiciously
at
maria
alexandrovna
and
observed
that
the
latter
was
in
a
high
state
of
agitation
therefore
instead
of
going
to
look
after
nikitka
she
went
through
the
salon
along
the
passage
to
her
own
room
and
through
that
to
a
dark
where
the
old
clothes
of
the
establishment
and
such
things
were
stored
there
she
approached
the
locked
door
on
tiptoe
and
stifling
her
breath
she
bent
to
the
keyhole
through
which
she
peeped
and
settled
herself
to
listen
intently
this
door
which
was
always
kept
shut
was
one
of
the
three
doors
communicating
with
the
room
where
maria
alexandrovna
and
zina
were
now
left
alone
maria
alexandrovna
always
considered
nastasia
an
untrustworthy
sort
of
woman
although
extremely
silly
into
the
bargain
of
course
she
had
suspected
the
than
eavesdropping
but
it
so
happened
that
at
the
moment
madame
moskaleva
was
too
agitated
and
excited
to
think
of
the
usual
precautions
she
was
sitting
in
her
and
gazing
at
zina
zina
felt
that
her
mother
was
looking
at
her
and
was
conscious
of
an
unpleasant
sensation
at
her
heart
zina
zina
slowly
turned
her
head
towards
the
speaker
and
lifted
her
splendid
dark
eyes
to
hers
zina
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
on
a
most
important
matter
zina
adopted
an
attentive
air
and
sat
still
with
folded
hands
waiting
for
light
in
her
face
there
was
an
expression
of
annoyance
as
well
as
irony
which
she
did
her
best
to
hide
i
wish
to
ask
you
first
zina
what
you
thought
of
mosgliakoff
you
have
known
my
opinion
of
him
for
a
long
time
replied
zina
surlily
yes
yes
of
course
but
i
think
he
is
getting
just
a
little
troublesome
with
his
continual
bothering
oh
but
he
says
he
is
in
love
with
me
in
which
case
his
importunity
is
pardonable
strange
you
used
not
to
be
so
ready
to
find
his
offences
pardonable
you
used
to
fly
out
at
him
if
ever
i
mentioned
his
name
strange
too
that
you
always
defended
him
and
were
so
very
anxious
that
i
should
marry
him
now
you
are
the
first
to
attack
him
yes
i
don
t
deny
zina
that
i
did
wish
then
to
see
you
married
to
mosgliakoff
it
was
painful
to
me
to
witness
your
continual
grief
your
sufferings
which
i
can
well
you
may
think
to
the
contrary
which
deprived
me
of
my
rest
at
night
i
determined
at
last
that
there
was
but
one
great
change
of
life
that
would
ever
save
you
from
the
sorrows
of
the
past
and
that
change
was
matrimony
we
are
not
rich
we
can
not
afford
to
go
abroad
all
the
asses
in
the
place
prick
their
long
ears
and
wonder
that
you
should
be
unmarried
at
years
old
and
they
must
needs
invent
all
sorts
of
stories
to
account
for
the
fact
as
if
i
would
marry
you
to
one
of
our
wretched
little
town
councillors
or
to
ivan
ivanovitch
the
family
lawyer
there
are
no
husbands
for
in
this
place
zina
of
course
paul
mosgliakoff
is
a
silly
sort
of
a
fellow
but
he
is
better
than
these
people
here
he
is
fairly
born
at
least
and
he
has
serfs
and
landed
property
all
of
which
is
better
than
living
by
bribes
and
corruption
and
goodness
knows
what
jobbery
besides
as
these
do
and
that
is
why
i
allowed
my
eyes
to
rest
on
him
but
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
i
never
had
any
real
sympathy
for
him
and
if
providence
has
sent
you
someone
better
now
oh
my
dear
girl
how
fortunate
that
you
have
not
given
your
word
to
mosgliakoff
you
didn
t
tell
him
anything
for
certain
did
you
zina
what
is
the
use
of
beating
about
the
bush
when
the
whole
thing
lies
in
a
couple
of
words
said
zina
with
some
show
of
annoyance
beating
about
the
bush
zina
is
that
the
way
to
speak
to
your
mother
but
what
am
i
you
have
long
ceased
to
trust
to
your
poor
mother
you
have
long
looked
upon
me
as
your
enemy
and
not
as
your
mother
at
all
oh
come
mother
you
and
i
are
beyond
quarrelling
about
an
expression
surely
we
understand
one
another
by
now
it
is
about
time
we
did
anyhow
but
you
offend
me
my
child
you
will
not
believe
that
i
am
ready
to
devote
i
can
give
in
order
to
establish
your
destiny
on
a
safe
and
happy
footing
zina
looked
angrily
and
sarcastically
at
her
mother
would
not
you
like
to
marry
me
to
this
old
prince
now
in
order
to
establish
my
destiny
on
a
safe
and
happy
footing
i
have
not
said
a
word
about
it
but
as
you
mention
the
fact
i
will
say
that
if
you
to
marry
the
prince
it
would
be
a
very
happy
thing
for
you
oh
well
i
consider
the
idea
utter
nonsense
cried
the
girl
passionately
nonsense
humbug
and
what
s
more
i
think
you
have
a
good
deal
too
much
poetical
inspiration
mamma
you
are
a
woman
poet
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
term
and
they
call
you
by
that
name
here
you
are
always
full
of
projects
and
the
impracticability
and
absurdity
of
your
ideas
does
not
in
the
least
discourage
you
i
felt
when
the
prince
was
sitting
here
that
you
had
that
notion
in
your
head
when
mosgliakoff
was
talking
nonsense
there
about
marrying
the
old
man
to
somebody
i
read
all
your
thoughts
in
your
face
i
am
ready
to
bet
any
money
that
you
are
thinking
of
it
now
and
that
you
have
come
to
me
now
about
this
very
question
however
as
your
perpetual
projects
on
my
behalf
are
beginning
to
weary
me
to
death
i
must
beg
you
not
to
say
one
word
about
it
not
mamma
do
you
hear
me
one
and
i
beg
you
will
remember
what
i
say
she
was
panting
with
rage
you
are
a
child
zina
a
poor
sick
child
said
maria
alexandrovna
in
tearful
accents
you
speak
to
your
poor
mother
disrespectfully
you
wound
me
deeply
my
dear
there
is
not
another
mother
in
the
world
who
would
have
borne
what
i
have
to
bear
from
you
every
day
but
you
are
suffering
you
are
sick
you
are
sorrowful
and
i
am
your
mother
and
first
of
all
i
am
a
christian
woman
i
must
bear
it
all
and
forgive
it
but
one
word
zina
if
i
had
really
thought
of
the
union
you
suggest
why
would
you
consider
it
so
impracticable
and
absurd
in
my
opinion
mosgliakoff
has
never
said
a
wiser
thing
than
he
did
when
he
declared
that
marriage
was
what
alone
could
save
the
prince
of
course
marriage
with
that
slovenly
slut
nastasia
there
he
certainly
make
a
fool
of
himself
now
look
here
mamma
do
you
ask
me
this
out
of
pure
curiosity
or
with
design
tell
me
the
all
i
ask
is
why
does
it
appear
to
you
to
be
so
absurd
good
heavens
mother
you
ll
drive
me
wild
what
a
fate
cried
zina
stamping
her
foot
with
impatience
i
ll
tell
you
why
if
you
can
t
see
for
yourself
not
to
mention
all
the
other
evident
absurdities
of
the
plan
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakened
wits
of
a
poor
old
man
and
deceive
him
and
marry
old
cripple
in
order
to
get
hold
of
his
money
then
every
day
and
every
hour
to
wish
for
his
death
is
in
my
opinion
not
only
nonsense
but
so
mean
mean
mamma
that
can
t
congratulate
you
on
your
brilliant
idea
that
s
all
i
can
say
there
was
silence
for
one
minute
zina
do
you
remember
all
that
happened
two
years
ago
asked
maria
alexandrovna
of
a
sudden
zina
trembled
mamma
she
said
severely
you
promised
me
solemnly
never
to
mention
that
and
i
ask
you
now
as
solemnly
my
dear
child
to
allow
me
to
break
that
promise
just
once
i
have
never
broken
it
before
zina
the
time
has
come
for
a
full
and
clear
understanding
between
us
these
two
years
of
silence
have
been
terrible
we
can
not
go
on
like
this
i
am
ready
to
pray
you
on
my
knees
to
let
me
speak
listen
zina
your
own
mother
who
bore
you
beseeches
you
on
her
knees
and
i
promise
you
faithfully
zina
and
solemnly
on
the
word
of
an
unhappy
but
adoring
mother
that
never
under
any
circumstances
not
even
to
save
my
life
will
i
ever
mention
the
subject
again
this
shall
be
the
last
time
but
it
is
absolutely
necessary
maria
alexandrovna
counted
upon
the
effect
of
her
words
and
with
reason
speak
then
said
zina
growing
whiter
every
moment
thank
you
zina
years
ago
there
came
to
the
house
to
teach
your
little
brother
mitya
since
dead
a
why
do
you
begin
so
solemnly
mamma
why
all
this
eloquence
all
these
quite
unnecessary
details
which
are
painful
to
me
and
only
too
well
known
to
both
of
us
cried
zina
with
a
sort
of
irritated
disgust
because
my
dear
child
i
your
mother
felt
in
some
degree
bound
to
justify
myself
before
you
and
also
because
i
wish
to
present
this
whole
question
to
you
from
an
entirely
new
point
of
view
and
not
from
that
mistaken
position
which
you
are
accustomed
to
take
up
with
regard
to
it
and
because
lastly
i
think
you
will
thus
better
understand
the
conclusion
at
which
i
shall
arrive
upon
the
whole
question
do
not
think
dear
child
that
i
wish
to
trifle
with
your
heart
no
zina
you
will
find
in
me
a
real
mother
and
perhaps
with
tears
streaming
from
your
eyes
you
will
ask
and
beseech
at
my
the
feet
of
the
as
you
have
just
called
me
and
pray
for
that
reconciliation
which
you
have
rejected
so
long
that
s
why
i
wish
to
recall
all
zina
that
has
happened
from
the
very
beginning
and
without
this
i
shall
not
speak
at
all
speak
then
repeated
zina
cursing
the
necessity
for
her
mother
s
eloquence
from
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
i
continue
then
zina
tutor
a
master
of
the
parish
school
almost
a
boy
makes
upon
you
what
is
to
me
a
totally
inexplicable
impression
i
built
too
much
upon
my
confidence
in
your
good
sense
or
your
noble
pride
and
principally
upon
the
fact
of
his
i
must
speak
out
allow
myself
to
harbour
the
slightest
suspicion
of
you
and
then
you
suddenly
come
to
me
one
fine
day
and
state
that
you
intend
to
marry
the
man
zina
it
was
putting
a
knife
to
my
heart
i
gave
a
shriek
and
lost
consciousness
but
of
course
you
remember
all
this
of
course
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
use
all
my
power
over
you
which
power
you
called
tyranny
think
for
boy
the
son
of
a
deacon
receiving
a
salary
of
twelve
roubles
a
writer
of
weak
verses
which
are
printed
out
of
pity
in
the
library
of
short
a
man
a
boy
who
could
talk
of
nothing
but
that
accursed
shakespeare
boy
to
be
the
husband
of
zenaida
moskaloff
forgive
me
zina
but
the
very
thought
of
it
all
makes
me
i
rejected
him
of
course
but
no
power
would
stop
your
father
only
blinked
his
eyes
as
usual
and
could
not
even
understand
what
i
was
telling
him
about
you
continue
your
relations
with
this
boy
even
giving
him
rendezvous
and
worst
of
all
you
allow
yourself
to
correspond
with
him
rumours
now
begin
to
flit
about
town
i
am
assailed
with
hints
they
blow
their
trumpets
of
joy
and
triumph
and
suddenly
all
my
fears
and
anticipations
are
verified
you
and
he
quarrel
over
something
or
other
he
shows
himself
to
be
a
boy
i
can
t
call
him
a
man
who
is
utterly
unworthy
of
you
and
threatens
to
show
your
letters
all
over
the
town
on
hearing
this
threat
you
beside
yourself
with
irritation
boxed
his
ears
yes
zina
i
am
aware
of
even
that
fact
i
know
all
all
but
to
wretched
boy
shows
one
of
your
letters
the
very
same
day
to
that
ne
zanshin
and
within
an
hour
natalie
dimitrievna
holds
it
in
her
deadly
enemy
the
same
evening
the
miserable
fellow
attempts
to
put
an
end
to
himself
in
remorse
in
a
word
there
is
a
fearful
scandal
stirred
up
that
slut
nastasia
comes
panting
to
me
with
the
dreadful
news
she
tells
me
that
natalie
dimitrievna
has
had
your
letter
for
a
whole
hour
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
whole
town
will
learn
of
your
foolishness
i
bore
it
all
i
did
not
fall
down
in
a
swoon
but
oh
the
blows
the
blows
you
dealt
to
my
heart
zina
that
shameless
scum
of
the
earth
nastasia
says
she
will
get
the
letter
back
for
two
hundred
roubles
i
myself
run
over
in
thin
shoes
too
through
the
snow
to
the
jew
baumstein
and
pledge
my
diamond
keepsake
of
my
dear
mother
s
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
letter
is
in
my
hands
nastasia
had
stolen
it
she
had
broken
open
a
desk
and
your
honour
was
safe
but
what
a
dreadful
day
you
had
sentenced
me
to
live
i
noticed
some
grey
hairs
among
my
raven
locks
for
the
first
time
next
morning
zina
you
have
judged
this
boy
s
action
yourself
now
you
can
admit
now
and
perhaps
smile
a
bitter
smile
over
the
admission
that
it
was
beyond
the
limits
of
good
sense
to
wish
to
entrust
your
fate
to
this
youth
but
since
that
fatal
time
you
are
wretched
my
child
you
are
miserable
you
can
not
forget
him
or
rather
not
he
was
never
worthy
of
you
you
can
not
forget
the
phantom
of
your
past
joy
this
wretched
young
fellow
is
now
on
the
point
of
they
say
and
you
angel
of
goodness
that
you
are
you
do
not
wish
to
marry
while
he
is
alive
because
you
fear
to
harass
him
in
his
last
days
because
to
this
day
he
is
miserable
with
jealousy
though
i
am
convinced
that
he
never
loved
you
in
the
best
and
highest
sense
of
the
word
i
know
well
that
hearing
of
mosgliakoff
s
proposal
to
you
he
has
been
in
a
flutter
of
jealousy
and
has
spied
upon
you
and
your
actions
ever
since
and
have
been
merciful
to
him
my
child
and
oh
god
knows
how
i
have
watered
my
pillow
with
tears
for
you
oh
mother
do
drop
all
this
sort
of
thing
cried
zina
with
inexpressible
agony
in
her
tone
surely
we
needn
t
hear
all
about
your
pillow
she
added
sharply
can
t
we
get
on
without
all
this
declamation
and
pirouetting
you
do
not
believe
me
zina
oh
do
not
look
so
unfriendly
at
me
my
child
my
eyes
have
not
been
dry
these
two
years
i
have
hidden
my
tears
from
you
but
i
am
changed
zina
mine
much
changed
and
in
many
ways
i
have
long
known
of
your
feelings
zina
but
i
admit
i
have
only
lately
realized
the
depth
of
your
mental
anguish
can
you
blame
me
my
child
if
i
looked
upon
this
attachment
of
yours
as
into
being
by
that
accursed
shakespeare
who
shoves
his
nose
in
everywhere
where
he
isn
t
wanted
what
mother
would
blame
me
for
my
fears
of
that
kind
for
my
measures
for
the
severity
of
my
judgment
but
now
understanding
as
i
do
and
realizing
your
two
years
sufferings
i
can
estimate
the
depth
of
your
real
feelings
believe
me
i
understand
you
far
better
than
you
understand
yourself
i
am
convinced
that
you
love
not
this
unnatural
boy
your
lost
happiness
your
broken
hopes
your
cracked
idol
i
have
loved
more
deeply
than
yourself
i
too
have
suffered
i
too
have
lost
my
exalted
ideals
and
seen
them
levelled
with
the
earth
and
therefore
who
can
blame
me
above
all
can
blame
me
now
i
consider
a
marriage
with
the
prince
to
be
the
one
saving
the
one
move
left
to
you
in
your
present
position
zina
listened
to
this
long
declamation
with
surprise
she
knew
well
that
her
mother
never
adopted
this
tone
without
good
reason
however
this
last
and
unexpected
conclusion
fairly
amazed
her
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
seriously
entertain
the
idea
of
marrying
me
to
this
prince
she
cried
bewildered
and
gazing
at
her
mother
almost
with
alarm
that
this
is
no
mere
idea
no
project
no
flighty
inspiration
but
your
deliberate
intention
i
guessed
right
then
and
pray
is
this
marriage
going
to
save
me
and
is
it
essential
to
me
in
my
present
position
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
what
you
have
been
talking
about
can
not
understand
you
mother
a
bit
and
can
t
understand
angel
mine
how
you
see
the
connection
of
it
all
cried
maria
alexandrovna
in
her
turn
in
the
first
place
you
would
pass
into
new
society
into
a
new
world
you
would
leave
for
ever
this
loathsome
little
town
so
full
of
sad
memories
for
you
where
you
meet
neither
friends
nor
kindness
where
they
have
bullied
and
maligned
you
where
all
hate
you
because
you
are
good
looking
you
could
go
abroad
this
very
spring
to
italy
switzerland
spain
spain
zina
where
the
alhambra
is
and
where
the
guadalquiver
wretched
little
stream
like
this
of
ours
but
one
moment
mother
you
talk
as
though
i
were
married
already
or
at
least
as
if
the
prince
had
made
me
an
offer
oh
dear
no
don
t
bother
yourself
about
that
my
angel
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
let
me
proceed
i
ve
said
my
firstly
now
then
for
my
secondly
i
understand
dear
child
with
what
loathing
you
would
give
your
hand
to
that
mosgliakoff
i
know
without
your
telling
me
so
that
i
shall
never
be
wife
cried
zina
angrily
and
with
flashing
eyes
if
only
you
knew
my
angel
how
i
understand
and
enter
into
your
loathing
for
him
it
is
dreadful
to
vow
before
the
altar
that
you
will
love
a
man
whom
you
dreadful
to
belong
to
one
whom
you
can
not
esteem
and
he
insists
on
your
only
marries
you
for
love
i
can
see
it
by
the
way
he
looks
at
you
why
deceive
ourselves
i
have
suffered
from
the
same
thing
for
years
your
father
ruined
so
to
speak
sucked
up
my
youth
you
have
seen
my
tears
many
a
time
father
s
away
in
the
country
don
t
touch
please
said
zina
i
know
you
always
take
his
part
oh
zina
my
very
heart
trembled
within
me
when
i
thought
to
arrange
your
marriage
with
mosgliakoff
for
financial
reasons
i
trembled
for
the
consequences
but
with
the
prince
it
is
different
you
need
not
deceive
him
you
can
not
be
expected
to
give
him
your
not
your
no
and
he
is
not
in
a
state
to
ask
it
of
you
good
heavens
what
nonsense
i
do
assure
you
you
are
in
error
from
the
very
first
the
first
and
most
important
step
understand
that
i
do
not
care
to
make
a
martyr
of
myself
for
some
unknown
reason
know
also
that
i
shall
not
marry
anyone
at
all
i
shall
remain
a
maid
you
have
bitten
my
head
off
for
the
last
two
years
because
i
would
not
marry
well
you
must
accept
the
fact
and
make
the
best
of
it
that
s
all
i
can
say
and
so
it
shall
be
but
zina
zina
don
t
be
so
cross
before
you
have
heard
me
out
what
a
little
person
you
are
to
be
sure
let
me
show
you
the
matter
from
my
point
of
view
and
you
ll
agree
with
really
will
the
prince
will
live
a
at
most
and
surely
it
is
better
to
be
a
young
widow
than
a
decayed
old
maid
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
you
will
be
a
rich
independent
i
dare
say
you
look
with
contempt
upon
all
these
upon
his
death
but
i
am
a
mother
and
what
mother
will
blame
me
for
my
foresight
and
if
you
my
angel
of
kindness
are
unwilling
to
marry
even
now
out
of
tenderness
for
that
wretched
boy
s
feelings
oh
think
think
how
by
marrying
this
prince
you
will
rejoice
his
heart
and
soothe
and
comfort
his
soul
for
if
he
has
a
single
particle
of
commonsense
he
must
understand
that
jealousy
of
this
old
man
were
ridiculous
he
will
understand
that
you
marry
money
for
convenience
that
stern
necessity
compels
you
to
it
and
lastly
he
will
understand
i
simply
wish
to
say
that
upon
the
prince
s
death
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
marry
whomsoever
you
that
s
a
truly
simple
arrangement
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
marry
this
prince
rob
him
of
his
money
and
then
count
upon
his
death
in
order
to
marry
my
lover
you
are
a
clever
arithmetician
mamma
you
do
your
sums
and
get
your
totals
nicely
you
wish
to
seduce
me
by
offering
me
this
oh
i
understand
you
understand
you
well
you
can
not
resist
the
expression
of
your
noble
sentiments
and
exalted
ideas
even
in
the
manufacture
of
a
nasty
business
why
can
t
you
say
simply
and
straightforwardly
zina
this
is
a
dirty
affair
but
it
will
pay
us
so
please
agree
with
me
at
all
events
that
would
be
candid
and
frank
on
your
but
my
dear
child
why
look
at
it
from
this
point
of
view
why
look
at
it
under
the
light
of
suspicion
as
and
low
cunning
and
covetousness
you
consider
my
calculations
as
meanness
as
deceit
but
by
all
that
is
good
and
true
where
is
the
meanness
show
me
the
deceit
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
you
are
so
beautiful
that
a
kingdom
would
be
a
fair
price
for
you
and
suddenly
you
you
the
possessor
of
this
divine
beauty
sacrifice
yourself
in
order
to
soothe
the
last
years
of
an
old
man
s
life
you
would
be
like
a
beautiful
star
shedding
your
light
over
the
evening
of
his
days
you
would
be
like
the
fresh
green
ivy
twining
in
and
about
his
old
age
not
the
stinging
nettle
that
this
wretched
woman
at
his
place
is
fastening
herself
upon
him
and
thirstily
sucking
his
blood
surely
his
money
his
rank
are
not
worthy
of
being
put
in
the
scales
beside
where
is
the
meanness
of
it
where
is
the
deceit
of
all
this
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
saying
i
suppose
they
worthy
of
being
weighed
against
me
if
i
am
to
marry
a
cripple
for
them
no
mother
however
you
look
at
it
it
is
deceit
and
you
can
t
get
out
of
on
the
contrary
my
dear
child
i
can
look
at
it
from
a
high
almost
from
an
of
view
you
yourself
told
me
once
in
a
fit
of
temporary
insanity
of
some
sort
that
you
wished
to
be
a
sister
of
charity
you
had
suffered
you
said
your
heart
could
love
no
more
if
then
you
can
not
love
turn
your
thoughts
to
the
higher
aspect
of
the
case
this
poor
old
man
has
also
is
unhappy
i
have
known
him
and
felt
the
deepest
sympathy
towards
to
love
many
a
year
be
his
friend
his
daughter
be
his
plaything
even
if
you
like
but
warm
his
old
heart
and
you
are
doing
a
good
virtuous
kind
noble
work
of
love
he
may
be
funny
to
look
at
don
t
think
of
that
he
s
but
half
a
him
you
are
a
christian
whatever
is
right
by
him
and
this
will
be
medicine
for
your
own
employment
action
all
this
will
heal
you
too
and
where
is
the
deceit
here
but
you
do
not
believe
me
perhaps
you
think
that
i
am
deceiving
myself
when
i
thus
talk
of
duty
and
of
action
you
think
that
i
a
woman
of
the
world
have
no
right
to
good
feeling
and
the
promptings
of
duty
and
virtue
very
well
do
not
trust
me
if
you
like
insult
me
do
what
you
please
to
your
poor
mother
but
you
will
have
to
admit
that
her
words
carry
the
stamp
of
good
sense
are
saving
words
imagine
that
someone
else
is
talking
to
you
not
i
shut
your
eyes
and
fancy
that
some
invisible
being
is
speaking
what
is
worrying
you
is
the
idea
that
all
this
is
for
sort
of
sale
or
purchase
very
well
then
the
money
if
it
is
so
loathsome
to
your
eyes
leave
just
as
much
as
is
absolutely
necessary
for
yourself
and
give
the
rest
to
the
poor
help
if
you
like
the
poor
fellow
who
lies
there
he
would
never
accept
my
help
muttered
zina
as
though
to
herself
he
would
not
but
his
mother
would
said
maria
alexandrovna
she
would
take
it
and
keep
her
secret
you
sold
your
a
present
from
your
aunt
half
a
year
or
so
ago
and
helped
her
know
all
about
it
i
know
too
that
the
woman
washes
linen
in
order
to
support
her
unfortunate
son
he
will
soon
be
where
he
requires
no
more
help
i
know
i
understand
your
maria
alexandrovna
sighed
a
real
sigh
they
say
he
is
in
a
consumption
and
must
die
but
says
so
i
asked
the
doctor
the
other
day
because
having
a
tender
heart
zina
i
felt
interested
in
the
poor
fellow
the
doctor
said
that
he
was
convinced
the
malady
was
consumption
that
it
was
dangerous
no
doubt
but
still
consumption
only
some
severe
affection
of
the
lungs
ask
him
yourself
he
certainly
told
me
that
under
different
of
climate
and
of
his
style
of
living
sick
man
might
well
recover
he
i
have
read
it
too
somewhere
that
off
spain
there
is
a
wonderful
island
called
think
it
was
malaga
anyhow
the
name
was
like
some
wine
where
not
only
ordinary
sufferers
from
chest
maladies
but
even
consumptive
patients
recover
entirely
solely
by
virtue
of
the
climate
and
that
sick
people
go
there
on
purpose
to
be
cured
oh
but
alhambra
the
lemons
and
the
riding
on
mules
all
this
is
enough
in
itself
to
impress
a
poetical
nature
you
think
he
would
not
accept
your
help
your
such
a
journey
very
is
permissible
where
it
may
save
a
man
s
life
give
him
hope
too
promise
him
your
love
promise
to
marry
him
when
you
are
a
widow
anything
in
the
world
can
be
said
with
care
and
tact
your
own
mother
would
not
counsel
you
to
an
ignoble
deed
zina
you
will
do
as
i
say
to
save
this
boy
s
life
and
with
this
object
everything
is
permissible
you
will
revive
his
hope
he
will
himself
begin
to
think
of
his
health
and
listen
to
what
the
doctor
says
to
him
he
will
do
his
best
to
resuscitate
his
dead
happiness
and
if
he
gets
well
again
even
if
you
never
marry
him
you
will
have
saved
him
from
the
dead
i
can
look
at
him
with
some
sympathy
i
admit
i
can
now
perhaps
sorrow
has
changed
him
for
the
better
and
i
say
frankly
if
he
should
be
worthy
of
you
when
you
become
a
widow
marry
him
by
all
means
you
will
be
rich
then
and
independent
you
can
not
only
cure
him
but
having
done
so
you
can
give
him
position
in
the
career
your
marriage
to
him
will
then
be
possible
and
pardonable
not
as
now
an
absolute
impossibility
for
what
would
become
of
both
of
you
were
you
to
be
capable
of
such
madness
universal
contempt
beggary
smacking
little
boys
which
is
part
of
his
duty
the
reading
of
shakespeare
perpetual
hopeless
life
in
mordasoff
and
lastly
his
certain
death
which
will
undoubtedly
take
place
before
long
unless
he
is
taken
away
from
here
while
if
you
resuscitate
you
raise
him
from
the
dead
as
it
were
you
raise
him
to
a
good
useful
and
virtuous
life
he
may
then
enter
public
himself
rank
and
a
name
at
the
least
even
if
he
must
die
he
will
die
happy
at
peace
with
himself
in
your
he
will
be
by
then
assured
of
your
love
and
forgiveness
of
the
past
and
lying
beneath
the
scent
of
myrtles
and
lemons
beneath
the
tropical
sky
of
the
south
oh
zina
all
this
is
within
your
grasp
and
is
yes
and
all
to
be
had
by
merely
marrying
this
maria
alexandrovna
broke
off
and
for
several
minutes
there
was
silence
not
a
word
was
said
on
either
side
zina
was
in
a
state
of
indescribable
agitation
i
say
indescribable
because
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
zina
s
feelings
i
can
not
guess
at
them
but
i
that
maria
alexandrovna
had
found
the
road
to
her
heart
not
knowing
how
her
words
had
sped
with
her
daughter
maria
alexandrovna
now
began
to
work
her
busy
brain
to
imagine
and
prepare
herself
for
every
possible
humour
that
zina
might
prove
to
be
in
but
at
last
she
concluded
that
she
had
happened
upon
the
right
track
after
all
her
rude
hand
had
touched
the
sorest
place
in
zina
s
heart
but
her
crude
and
absurd
sentimental
twaddle
had
not
blinded
her
daughter
however
that
doesn
t
matter
the
mother
all
i
care
to
do
is
to
make
her
i
wish
my
ideas
to
stick
so
she
reflected
and
she
gained
her
end
the
effect
was
arrow
reached
the
mark
zina
had
listened
hungrily
as
her
mother
spoke
her
cheeks
were
burning
her
breast
heaved
listen
mother
she
said
at
last
with
decision
though
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
face
showed
clearly
what
the
decision
had
cost
her
listen
but
at
this
moment
a
sudden
noise
in
the
entrance
hall
and
a
shrill
female
voice
asking
for
maria
alexandrovna
interrupted
zina
while
her
mother
jumped
up
from
her
chair
oh
the
devil
fly
away
with
this
magpie
of
a
woman
cried
the
latter
furiously
why
i
nearly
drove
her
out
by
force
only
a
fortnight
ago
she
added
almost
in
despair
i
can
t
i
can
t
receive
her
now
zina
this
question
is
too
important
to
be
put
off
she
must
have
news
for
me
or
she
never
would
have
dared
to
come
i
won
t
receive
the
old
oh
glad
i
am
to
see
you
dear
sophia
petrovna
what
lucky
chance
brought
to
see
me
what
a
surprise
said
maria
alexandrovna
advancing
to
receive
her
guest
zina
escaped
out
of
the
room
chapter
vi
mrs
colonel
tarpuchin
or
sophia
petrovna
was
only
morally
like
a
magpie
she
was
more
akin
to
the
sparrow
tribe
viewed
physically
she
was
a
little
bit
of
a
woman
of
fifty
summers
or
so
with
lively
eyes
and
yellow
patches
all
over
her
face
on
her
little
wizened
body
and
spare
limbs
she
wore
a
black
silk
dress
which
was
perpetually
on
the
rustle
for
this
little
woman
could
never
sit
still
for
an
instant
this
was
the
most
inveterate
and
bitterest
in
the
town
she
took
her
stand
on
the
fact
that
she
was
a
colonel
s
wife
though
she
often
fought
with
her
husband
the
colonel
and
scratched
his
face
handsomely
on
such
occasions
add
to
this
that
it
was
her
custom
to
drink
four
glasses
of
vodki
at
lunch
or
earlier
and
four
more
in
the
evening
and
that
she
hated
antipova
to
madness
i
ve
just
come
in
for
a
minute
she
panted
it
s
no
use
sitting
time
i
wanted
to
let
you
know
what
s
going
on
simply
that
the
whole
town
has
gone
mad
over
this
prince
our
beauties
you
know
what
i
mean
are
all
after
him
fishing
for
him
pulling
him
about
giving
him
would
not
believe
it
you
now
how
on
earth
you
could
ever
have
let
him
out
of
the
house
i
can
t
understand
are
you
aware
that
he
s
at
natalia
dimitrievna
s
at
this
moment
at
dimitrievna
cried
maria
alexandrovna
jumping
up
why
he
was
only
going
to
see
the
governor
and
then
call
in
for
one
moment
at
the
antipova
s
oh
yes
just
for
one
course
well
catch
him
if
you
can
there
that
s
all
i
can
say
he
found
the
governor
out
and
went
on
to
antipova
s
where
he
has
promised
to
dine
there
natalia
caught
is
never
away
from
antipova
nowadays
persuaded
him
to
come
away
with
her
to
lunch
so
there
s
your
prince
catch
him
if
you
can
but
s
with
mosgliakoff
indeed
he
s
gone
too
and
they
ll
be
playing
at
cards
and
clearing
him
out
before
he
knows
where
he
is
and
the
things
natalia
is
saying
loud
if
you
please
she
s
telling
the
prince
to
his
face
that
you
have
got
hold
of
him
with
certain
she
calmly
tells
him
this
to
his
face
of
course
he
doesn
t
understand
a
word
of
it
and
simply
sits
there
like
a
soaked
cat
and
says
and
would
you
believe
it
she
has
trotted
out
her
girl
of
fifteen
in
a
dress
down
to
her
word
on
it
then
she
has
sent
for
that
little
she
s
in
a
short
dress
too
i
swear
it
doesn
t
reach
her
knees
i
looked
at
it
carefully
through
my
she
s
stuck
red
caps
with
some
sort
of
feathers
in
them
on
their
heads
and
set
them
to
dance
some
silly
dance
to
the
piano
accompaniment
for
the
prince
s
benefit
you
know
his
little
weakness
as
to
our
sex
you
can
imagine
him
staring
at
them
through
his
glass
and
saying
figures
tfu
they
ve
turned
the
place
into
a
music
hall
call
that
a
dance
i
was
at
school
at
madame
jarne
s
i
know
and
there
were
plenty
of
princesses
and
countesses
there
with
me
too
and
i
know
i
danced
before
senators
and
councillors
and
earned
their
applause
too
but
as
for
this
s
a
low
and
nothing
more
i
simply
with
shame
couldn
t
stand
it
and
came
how

my
own
sledge
at
the
door
or
i
d
go
with
having
got
rid
of
this
walking
newspaper
maria
alexandrovna
waited
a
moment
to
free
herself
of
a
little
of
her
agitation
colonel
s
advice
was
good
and
practical
there
was
no
use
losing
time
to
lose
in
fact
but
the
greatest
difficulty
of
all
was
as
yet
unsettled
maria
alexandrovna
flew
to
zina
s
room
zina
was
walking
up
and
down
pale
with
hands
folded
and
head
bent
on
her
bosom
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
but
resolve
was
there
too
and
sparkled
in
the
glance
which
she
threw
on
her
mother
as
the
latter
entered
the
room
she
hastily
dried
her
tears
and
a
sarcastic
smile
played
on
her
lips
once
more
mamma
she
began
anticipating
her
mother
s
speech
you
have
already
wasted
much
of
your
eloquence
over
much
but
you
have
not
blinded
me
i
am
not
a
child
to
do
the
work
of
a
sister
of
mercy
without
the
slightest
call
thereto
justify
one
s
proceeding
in
reality
from
the
purest
egotism
by
attributing
to
it
noble
ends
this
is
a
sort
of
jesuitism
which
can
not
deceive
listen
i
repeat
all
could
not
deceive
and
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
but
dearest
child
began
her
mother
in
some
alarm
be
quiet
mamma
have
patience
and
hear
me
out
in
spite
of
the
full
consciousness
that
all
this
is
pure
jesuitism
and
in
spite
of
my
full
knowledge
of
the
absolutely
ignoble
character
of
such
an
act
i
accept
your
proposition
in
full
hear
and
inform
you
hereby
that
i
am
ready
to
marry
the
prince
more
i
am
ready
to
help
you
to
the
best
of
my
power
in
your
endeavours
to
lure
the
prince
into
making
me
an
offer
why
do
i
do
this
you
need
not
know
that
enough
that
i
have
consented
i
have
consented
to
the
whole
bringing
him
his
boots
to
serving
him
i
will
dance
for
him
that
my
meanness
may
be
in
some
sort
atoned
i
shall
do
all
i
possibly
can
so
that
he
shall
never
regret
that
he
married
me
but
in
return
for
my
consent
i
insist
upon
knowing
you
intend
to
bring
the
matter
about
since
you
have
spoken
so
warmly
on
the
know
you
am
convinced
you
must
have
some
definite
plan
of
operation
in
your
head
be
frank
for
once
in
your
life
your
candour
is
the
essential
condition
upon
which
alone
i
give
my
consent
i
shall
not
decide
until
you
have
told
me
what
i
require
maria
alexandrovna
was
so
surprised
by
the
unexpected
conclusion
at
which
zina
arrived
that
she
stood
before
the
latter
some
little
while
dumb
with
amazement
and
staring
at
her
with
all
her
eyes
prepared
to
have
to
combat
the
stubborn
romanticism
of
her
obstinate
nobility
of
character
she
always
feared
had
suddenly
heard
this
same
daughter
consent
to
all
that
her
mother
had
required
of
her
consequently
the
matter
had
taken
a
very
different
complexion
her
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
zina
zina
she
cried
you
are
my
life
she
could
say
no
more
but
fell
to
embracing
and
kissing
her
daughter
oh
mother
i
don
t
all
this
kissing
cried
zina
with
impatience
and
disgust
i
don
t
need
all
this
rapture
on
your
part
all
i
want
is
a
plain
answer
to
my
question
but
zina
i
love
you
i
adore
you
darling
and
you
repel
me
like
this
i
am
working
for
your
happiness
child
tears
sparkled
in
her
eyes
maria
alexandrovna
really
loved
her
daughter
in
her
own
way
and
just
now
she
actually
felt
deeply
for
once
in
her
to
her
agitation
and
the
success
of
her
eloquence
zina
in
spite
of
her
present
distorted
view
of
things
in
general
knew
that
her
mother
loved
her
but
this
love
only
annoyed
her
she
would
much
would
have
been
easier
for
it
had
been
hate
well
well
don
t
be
angry
m
so
excited
just
now
she
said
to
soothe
her
mother
s
feelings
i
m
not
angry
i
m
not
angry
darling
i
know
you
are
much
agitated
cried
maria
alexandrovna
you
say
my
child
that
you
wish
me
to
be
candid
very
well
i
will
i
will
be
frank
i
assure
you
but
you
might
have
trusted
me
firstly
then
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
no
actually
organized
plan
plan
that
is
you
must
understand
with
that
clever
little
head
of
yours
you
must
see
zina
that
i
have
such
a
plan
all
cut
out
i
even
anticipate
some
difficulties
why
that
magpie
of
a
woman
has
just
been
telling
me
all
sorts
of
things
we
ought
to
be
quick
by
the
bye
you
see
i
am
quite
open
with
you
but
i
swear
to
you
that
the
end
shall
be
attained
she
added
ecstatically
my
convictions
are
not
the
result
of
a
poetical
nature
as
you
told
me
just
now
they
are
founded
on
facts
i
rely
on
the
weakness
of
the
prince
s
is
a
canvas
upon
which
one
can
stitch
any
pattern
one
pleases
the
only
fear
is
we
may
be
interfered
with
but
a
fool
of
a
woman
like
that
is
not
going
to
get
the
better
of
she
added
stamping
her
foot
and
with
flashing
eyes
that
s
my
part
of
the
business
though
and
to
manage
it
thoroughly
i
must
begin
as
soon
as
fact
the
whole
thing
or
the
most
important
part
of
it
must
be
arranged
this
very
day
very
well
mamma
but
now
listen
to
one
more
piece
of
candour
do
you
know
why
i
am
so
interested
in
your
plan
of
operations
and
do
not
trust
it
because
i
am
not
sure
of
myself
i
have
told
you
already
that
i
consent
to
but
i
must
warn
you
that
if
i
find
the
details
of
your
plan
of
operations
dirty
too
mean
and
repulsive
i
shall
not
be
able
to
stand
it
and
shall
assuredly
throw
you
over
i
know
that
this
is
a
new
pettiness
to
consent
to
a
wicked
thing
and
then
fear
the
dirt
in
which
it
floats
but
what
s
to
be
done
so
it
will
be
and
i
warn
you
but
zina
dear
child
where
is
the
wickedness
in
this
asked
maria
alexandrovna
timidly
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
a
marriage
for
profit
everybody
does
it
look
at
it
in
this
light
and
you
will
see
there
is
nothing
particular
in
it
it
is
good
form
enough
oh
mamma
don
t
try
to
play
the
fox
over
me
don
t
you
see
that
i
have
consented
to
what
else
do
you
require
of
me
don
t
be
alarmed
if
i
call
things
by
their
proper
names
for
all
you
know
it
may
be
my
only
comfort
and
a
bitter
smile
played
over
her
lips
very
well
very
well
dear
we
may
disagree
as
to
ideas
and
yet
be
very
fond
of
one
another
but
if
you
are
afraid
of
the
working
of
my
plan
and
dread
that
you
will
see
any
baseness
or
meanness
about
it
leave
it
all
to
me
dear
and
i
guarantee
you
that
not
a
particle
of
dirt
shall
soil
you
your
hands
shall
be
clean
as
if
i
would
be
the
one
to
compromise
you
trust
me
entirely
and
all
shall
go
grandly
and
with
dignity
all
shall
be
done
worthily
there
shall
be
no
if
there
be
a
whisper
afterwards
we
shall
all
be
out
of
the
way
far
off
we
shall
not
stay
here
of
course
let
them
if
they
like
won
t
care
besides
they
are
not
worth
bothering
about
and
i
wonder
at
your
being
so
frightened
of
these
people
zina
don
t
be
angry
with
me
how
can
you
be
so
frightened
with
your
proud
nature
i
m
not
frightened
you
don
t
understand
me
a
bit
said
zina
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
very
well
darling
don
t
be
angry
i
only
talk
like
this
because
these
people
about
here
are
always
stirring
up
mud
if
they
can
while
is
the
first
time
in
your
life
you
have
done
a
mean
action
what
an
old
fool
i
am
on
the
contrary
this
is
a
most
generous
act
i
ll
prove
this
to
you
once
more
zina
firstly
then
it
all
depends
upon
the
point
of
view
you
take
oh
bother
your
proofs
mother
i
ve
surely
had
enough
of
them
by
now
cried
zina
angrily
and
stamped
her
foot
on
the
floor
well
darling
i
won
t
it
was
stupid
of
won
t
there
was
another
moment
s
silence
maria
alexandrovna
looked
into
her
daughter
s
eyes
as
a
little
dog
looks
into
the
eyes
of
its
mistress
i
don
t
understand
how
you
are
going
to
set
about
it
said
zina
at
last
in
a
tone
of
disgust
i
feel
sure
you
will
only
plunge
yourself
into
a
pool
of
shame
i
m
not
thinking
of
these
people
about
here
i
despise
their
opinions
but
it
would
be
very
ignominious
for
oh
if
that
s
all
my
dear
child
don
t
bother
your
head
about
it
please
don
t
let
us
be
agreed
about
it
and
then
you
need
not
fear
for
me
dear
me
if
you
but
knew
though
what
things
i
have
done
and
kept
my
skin
whole
i
tell
you
this
is
in
comparison
with
difficulties
which
i
have
arranged
successfully
only
let
me
try
but
first
of
all
we
must
get
the
prince
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
that
s
the
first
move
all
the
rest
will
depend
upon
the
way
we
manage
this
however
i
can
foresee
the
result
they
ll
all
rise
against
us
but
i
ll
manage
all
right
i
m
a
little
nervous
about
mosgliakoff
mosgliakoff
said
zina
contemptuously
yes
but
don
t
you
be
afraid
zina
i
ll
give
you
my
word
i
ll
work
him
so
that
he
shall
help
us
himself
you
don
t
know
me
yet
my
zina
my
child
when
i
heard
about
this
old
prince
having
arrived
this
morning
the
idea
as
it
were
shone
out
all
at
once
in
my
brain
who
would
have
thought
of
his
really
coming
to
us
like
this
it
is
a
chance
such
as
you
might
wait
for
a
thousand
years
in
vain
zina
my
angel
there
s
no
shame
in
what
you
are
doing
what
wrong
is
to
marry
a
man
whom
you
loathe
your
marriage
with
the
prince
will
be
no
marriage
it
is
simply
a
domestic
contract
it
is
he
the
old
fool
who
gains
by
it
it
is
who
is
made
unspeakably
immeasurably
happy
oh
zina
how
lovely
you
look
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
give
you
half
a
kingdom
if
you
but
raised
your
finger
for
it
they
all
are
who
wouldn
t
kiss
a
hand
like
this
and
maria
alexandrovna
kissed
her
daughter
s
hand
warmly
why
this
is
my
own
flesh
and
blood
zina
what
s
to
be
done
afterwards
you
won
t
part
with
me
will

won
t
drive
your
old
mother
away
when
you
are
happy

darling
for
though
we
have
quarrelled
often
enough
you
have
not
such
another
friend
as
i
am
zina
mamma
if
you
ve
made
up
your
mind
to
it
all
perhaps
it
is
time
you
set
about
making
some
move
in
the
matter
we
are
losing
time
said
zina
impatiently
yes
it
is
it
is
indeed
time
and
here
am
i
gabbling
on
while
they
are
all
doing
their
best
to
seduce
the
prince
away
from
us
i
must
be
off
at
once
i
shall
find
them
and
bring
the
prince
back
by
force
if
need
be
zina
darling
child
don
t
be
afraid
and
don
t
look
sad
dear
please
don
t
it
will
be
all
well
nay
well
maria
alexandrovna
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
zina
and
dashed
out
of
the
room
she
stopped
one
moment
at
her
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
then
in
another
minute
was
seated
in
her
carriage
and
careering
through
the
mordasoff
streets
maria
alexandrovna
lived
in
good
style
and
her
carriage
was
always
in
waiting
at
that
hour
in
case
of
need
no
no
my
dears
it
s
not
for
to
outwit
me
she
thought
as
she
drove
along
zina
agrees
so
half
the
work
is
done
oh
zina
zina
so
your
imagination
is
susceptible
to
pretty
little
visions
is
it
and
i
treat
her
to
a
pretty
little
picture
she
was
really
touched
at
last
and
how
lovely
the
child
looked
if
i
had
her
beauty
i
should
turn
half
europe
but
wait
a
bit
it
s
all
right
shakespeare
will
fly
away
to
another
world
when
you
re
a
princess
my
dear
and
know
a
few
people
what
does
she
know
mordasoff
and
the
tutor
and
what
a
princess
she
will
make
i
to
see
her
pride
and
pluck
she
looks
at
you
like
any
queen
and
not
to
know
her
own
good
however
she
soon
will
wait
a
bit
let
this
old
fool
die
and
then
the
boy
and
i
ll
marry
her
to
a
reigning
prince
yet
the
only
thing
i
m
afraid
of
t
i
trusted
her
too
much
didn
t
i
allow
my
feelings
to
run
away
with
me
too
far
i
am
anxious
about
her
i
am
anxious
anxious
thus
maria
alexandrovna
reflected
as
she
drove
along
she
was
a
busy
woman
was
maria
alexandrovna
zina
left
alone
continued
her
solitary
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
folded
hands
and
thoughtful
brow
she
had
a
good
deal
to
think
of
over
and
over
again
she
repeated
it
s
s
it
s
time
what
did
this
ejaculation
mean
once
or
twice
tears
glistened
on
her
long
silken
eyelashes
and
she
did
not
attempt
to
wipe
them
away
her
mother
worried
herself
in
vain
as
far
as
zina
was
concerned
for
her
daughter
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
was
ready
come
what
might
wait
a
bit
said
the
widow
to
herself
as
she
picked
her
way
out
of
her
after
having
observed
and
listened
to
the
interview
between
zina
and
her
mother
and
i
was
thinking
of
a
wedding
dress
for
myself
i
positively
thought
the
prince
would
really
come
my
way
so
much
for
wedding
a
fool
i
was
oho
maria

a
baggage

bribe
of

roubles

spend

expenses
connected
with

chapter
vii
maria
alexandrovna
s
genius
had
conceived
a
great
and
daring
project
to
marry
her
daughter
to
a
rich
man
a
prince
and
a
cripple
to
marry
her
secretly
to
take
advantage
of
the
senile
feebleness
of
her
guest
to
marry
her
daughter
to
this
old
man
as
her
enemies
would
call
it
not
only
a
daring
it
was
a
downright
audacious
project
of
course
in
case
of
success
it
would
be
a
profitable
undertaking
enough
but
in
the
event
of
what
an
ignominious
position
for
the
authors
of
such
a
failure
maria
alexandrovna
knew
all
this
but
she
did
not
despair
she
had
been
through
deeper
mire
than
this
as
she
had
rightly
informed
zina
undoubtedly
all
this
looked
rather
too
like
a
robbery
on
the
high
road
to
be
altogether
pleasant
but
maria
alexandrovna
did
not
dwell
much
on
this
thought
she
had
one
very
simple
but
very
pointed
notion
on
the
subject
namely
married
they
can
t
be
unmarried
it
was
a
simple
but
very
pleasant
reflection
and
the
very
thought
of
it
gave
maria
alexandrovna
a
tingling
sensation
in
all
her
limbs
she
was
in
a
great
state
of
agitation
and
sat
in
her
carriage
as
if
on
pins
and
needles
she
was
anxious
to
begin
the
fray
her
grand
plan
of
operations
was
drawn
up
but
there
were
thousands
of
small
details
to
be
settled
and
these
must
depend
upon
circumstances
she
was
not
agitated
by
fear
of
dear
no
all
she
minded
was
delay
she
feared
the
delay
and
obstructions
that
might
be
put
in
her
way
by
the
mordasoff
ladies
whose
pretty
ways
she
knew
so
well
she
was
well
aware
that
probably
at
this
moment
the
whole
town
knew
all
about
her
present
intentions
though
she
had
not
revealed
them
to
a
living
soul
she
had
found
out
by
painful
experience
that
nothing
not
the
most
secret
event
could
happen
in
her
house
in
the
morning
but
it
was
known
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
town
by
the
evening
of
course
no
anticipation
no
presentiment
deterred
or
deceived
maria
alexandrovna
she
might
feel
such
sensations
at
times
but
she
despised
them
now
this
is
what
had
happened
in
the
town
this
morning
and
of
which
our
heroine
was
as
yet
only
partly
informed
about
that
is
just
three
hours
after
the
prince
s
arrival
at
mordasoff
extraordinary
rumours
began
to
circulate
about
the
town
whence
came
they
who
spread
them
none
could
say
but
they
spread
like
everyone
suddenly
began
to
assure
his
neighbour
that
maria
alexandrovna
had
engaged
her
daughter
to
the
prince
that
mosgliakoff
had
notice
to
quit
and
that
all
was
settled
and
signed
and
the
penniless
zina
was
to
be
the
princess
whence
came
this
rumour
could
it
be
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
so
thoroughly
known
that
her
friends
could
anticipate
her
thoughts
and
actions
under
any
given
circumstances
the
fact
is
every
inhabitant
of
a
provincial
town
lives
under
a
glass
case
there
is
no
possibility
of
his
keeping
anything
whatever
secret
from
his
honourable
in
the
place
they
know
they
know
it
too
better
than
he
does
himself
every
provincial
person
should
be
a
psychologist
by
nature
and
that
is
why
i
have
been
surprised
often
and
often
to
observe
when
i
am
among
provincials
that
there
is
not
a
great
number
of
one
would
expect
an
infinite
number
of
dreadful
asses
however
this
a
digression
the
rumour
thus
spread
then
was
a
and
startling
shock
to
the
mordasoff
system
such
a
marriage
with
this
to
all
to
be
a
thing
so
very
desirable
so
brilliant
that
the
strange
side
of
the
affair
had
not
seemed
to
strike
anyone
as
yet
one
more
circumstance
must
be
noticed
zina
was
even
more
detested
in
the
place
than
her
mother
why
i
don
t
know
perhaps
her
beauty
was
the
prime
cause
perhaps
too
it
was
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
as
it
were
one
of
themselves
a
fruit
of
their
own
soil
if
she
was
to
go
away
she
might
even
be
missed
she
kept
the
place
alive
more
or
might
be
dull
without
her
but
with
zina
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
she
lived
more
in
the
clouds
than
in
the
town
of
mordasoff
she
was
no
company
for
these
good
people
she
could
not
pair
with
them
perhaps
she
bore
herself
towards
them
unconsciously
though
too
haughtily
and
now
this
same
zina
this
haughty
girl
about
whom
there
were
certain
scandalous
stories
afloat
this
same
zina
was
to
become
a
millionaire
a
princess
and
a
woman
of
rank
and
eminence
in
a
couple
of
years
she
might
marry
again
some
duke
perhaps
or
a
general
maybe
a
governor
their
own
governor
was
a
widower
and
very
fond
of
the
ladies
then
she
would
be
the
first
lady
of
their
province
why
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
would
be
intolerable
in
fact
this
rumour
of
zina
s
marriage
with
the
prince
aroused
more
irritation
in
mordasoff
than
any
other
piece
of
gossip
within
the
memory
of
man
people
told
each
other
that
it
was
a
sin
and
a
shame
that
the
prince
was
crazy
that
the
old
man
was
being
deceived
caught
you
like
that
the
prince
must
be
saved
from
the
bloodthirsty
talons
he
had
floundered
into
that
the
thing
was
simply
robbery
immorality
and
why
were
any
others
worse
than
zina
why
should
not
somebody
else
marry
the
prince
maria
alexandrovna
only
guessed
at
all
this
at
that
was
quite
enough
she
knew
that
the
whole
town
would
rise
up
and
use
all
and
every
means
to
defeat
her
ends
why
they
had
tried
to
confiscate
the
prince
already
she
would
have
to
retrieve
him
by
force
and
if
she
should
succeed
in
luring
or
forcing
him
back
now
she
could
not
keep
him
tied
to
her
for
ever
again
what
was
to
prevent
this
whole
troop
of
mordasoff
gossips
from
coming
to
her
salon
under
such
a
plausible
plea
too
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
turn
them
out
she
knew
well
that
if
kicked
out
of
the
door
these
good
people
would
get
in
at
the
thing
which
had
actually
happened
before
now
at
mordasoff
in
a
word
there
was
not
an
hour
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
and
meanwhile
things
were
not
even
begun
a
brilliant
idea
now
struck
maria
alexandrovna
we
shall
hear
what
this
idea
was
in
its
proper
place
meanwhile
i
will
only
state
that
my
heroine
dashed
through
the
streets
of
mordasoff
looking
like
a
threatening
as
she
swept
along
full
of
the
stern
and
implacable
resolve
that
the
prince
should
come
back
if
she
had
to
drag
him
and
fight
for
him
and
that
all
mordasoff
might
fall
in
ruins
but
she
should
have
her
way
her
first
move
was
could
not
have
been
more
so
she
chanced
to
meet
the
prince
in
the
street
and
carried
him
off
to
dinner
with
her
if
my
reader
wishes
to
know
this
feat
was
accomplished
with
such
a
circle
of
enemies
about
and
around
her
and
how
she
managed
to
make
such
a
fool
of
antipova
then
i
must
be
allowed
to
point
out
that
such
a
question
is
an
insult
to
maria
alexandrovna
as
if
were
not
capable
of
outwitting
any
antipova
that
ever
breathed
she
simply
arrested
the
prince
at
her
rival
s
very
door
as
he
alighted
there
with
mosgliakoff
in
spite
of
the
latter
s
terror
of
a
scandal
and
in
spite
of
everything
else
and
she
popped
the
old
man
into
the
carriage
beside
her
of
course
the
prince
made
very
little
resistance
and
as
usual
forgot
all
about
the
episode
in
a
couple
of
minutes
and
was
as
happy
as
possible
at
dinner
he
was
hilarious
to
a
degree
he
made
jokes
and
fun
and
told
stories
which
had
no
ends
or
which
he
tacked
on
to
ends
belonging
to
other
stories
without
remarking
the
fact
he
had
had
three
glasses
of
champagne
at
lunch
at
natalie
dimitrievna
s
he
now
took
more
wine
and
his
old
head
whirled
with
it
maria
alexandrovna
plied
him
well
the
dinner
was
very
good
the
mistress
of
the
house
kept
the
company
alive
with
most
bewitching
airs
and
manners
least
so
it
should
have
been
but
all
excepting
herself
and
the
prince
were
terribly
dull
on
this
occasion
zina
sat
silent
and
grave
mosgliakoff
was
clearly
off
his
feed
he
was
very
thoughtful
and
as
this
was
unusual
maria
alexandrovna
was
considerably
anxious
about
him
the
widow
looked
cross
and
cunning
she
continually
made
mysterious
signs
to
mosgliakoff
on
the
sly
but
the
latter
took
no
notice
of
them
if
the
mistress
herself
had
not
been
so
amiable
and
bewitching
the
dinner
party
might
have
been
mistaken
for
a
lunch
at
a
funeral
meanwhile
maria
alexandrovna
s
condition
of
mind
was
in
reality
excited
and
agitated
to
a
terrible
degree
zina
alone
terrified
her
by
her
tragic
look
and
tearful
eyes
and
there
was
another
that
accursed
mosgliakoff
would
probably
sit
about
and
get
in
the
way
of
business
one
could
not
well
set
about
it
with
him
in
the
room
so
maria
alexandrovna
rose
from
the
table
in
some
agitation
but
what
was
her
amazement
her
joyful
surprise
when
mosgliakoff
came
up
to
her
after
dinner
of
his
own
accord
and
suddenly
and
most
unexpectedly
informed
her
that
he
his
infinite
the
house
on
important
business
for
a
short
while
why
where
are
you
going
to
she
asked
with
great
show
of
regret
well
you
see
began
mosgliakoff
rather
disconcerted
and
uncomfortable
i
have
i
come
to
you
for
advice
what
is
is
it
why
you
see
my
godfather
know
the
man
i
met
him
in
the
street
and
he
is
dreadfully
angry
with
me
says
i
am
grown
so
that
though
i
have
been
in
mordasoff
three
times
i
have

with
joy
as
paul
took
his
departure
out
of
the
room
but
paul
had
only
just
reached
the
hall
and

putting
on
his

the
widow
cuttingly
and
why

comedy

probably
just
beginning
what
comedy
hush
don

talk
so
loud
the
comedy
of
humbugging
this
morning
when
you
went
away
with
the
prince
maria
alexandrovna
spent
a
whole
hour
talking
zina
over
into
marrying
the
old
man
she
told
her
that
nothing
was
easier
than
to
lure
the
prince
into
marrying
her
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
that
were
enough
to
make
one
sick
zina
agreed
you
should
have
heard
the
pretty
way
in
which
were
spoken
of
they
think
you
simply
a
fool
zina
said
plump
out
that
she
would
never
marry
you
listen
now
listen
would
be
most
godless
cunning
paul
stammered
looking
sheepishly
into
nastasia
s
eyes
well
just
you
ll
hear
that
and
more
besides
but
how
am
i
to
listen
here

that
keyhole
oh
but
nastasia
petrovna
i

eavesdrop

oh
nonsense

your
pride
in
your
pocket
you
ve
come
and
you
must
listen
now
well
at
all
oh
if
you
can
t
bear
to
be
an
eavesdropper
let
it
alone
and
be
made
a
fool
of
one
goes
out
of
one
s
way
solely
out
of
pity
for
you
and
you
must
needs
make
difficulties
what
is
it
to
me
i
m
not
doing
this
for
myself

leave
the
house
before
night
in
any
case
paul
steeling
his
heart
bent
to
the
keyhole
his
pulses
were
raging
and
throbbing
he
did
not
realise
what
was
going
on
or
what
he
was
doing
or
where
he
was
chapter
viii
so
you
were
very
gay
prince
at
natalia
dimitrievna
s
asked
maria
alexandrovna
surveying
the
battlefield
before
her
she
was
anxious
to
begin
the
conversation
as
innocently
as
possible
but
her
heart
beat
loud
with
hope
and
agitation
after
dinner
the
prince
had
been
carried
off
to
the
salon
where
he
was
first
received
in
the
morning
maria
alexandrovna
prided
herself
on
this
room
and
always
used
it
on
state
occasions
the
old
man
after
his
six
glasses
of
champagne
was
not
very
steady
on
his
legs
but
he
talked
away
all
the
more
for
the
same
reason
surveying
the
field
of
battle
before
the
fray
maria
alexandrovna
had
observed
with
satisfaction
that
the
voluptuous
old
man
had
already
begun
to
regard
zina
with
great
tenderness
and
her
maternal
heart
beat
high
with
joy
oh
gay
indeed
replied
the
prince
and
do
you
know
dimitrievna
is
a
woman
a
woman
howsoever
busy
with
her
own
high
thoughts
and
exalted
ideas
maria
alexandrovna
s
heart
waxed
wrathful
to
hear
such
a
loud
blast
of
praise
on
her
rival
s
account
oh
prince
she
began
with
flashing
eyes
if
natalia
dimitrievna
is
a
charming
woman
in
your
eyes
then
i
really
don
t
know
to
think
after
such
a
statement
dear
prince
you
must
not
claim
to
know
society
no
really
you
me
i
assure
assure
you
prince
listen
zina
i
must
just
tell
the
prince
that
absurd
story
about
what
natalia
dimitrievna
did
when
she
was
here
last
week
dearest
prince
i
am
not
a
but
i
must
i
really
tell
you
this
if
only
to
make
you
laugh
and
to
show
you
a
living
picture
as
it
were
of
what
people
are
like
in
this
place
well
last
week
this
natalia
dimitrievna
came
to
call
upon
me
coffee
was
brought
in
and
i
had
to
leave
the
room
for
a
forget
all
events
i
went
out
now
i
happened
to
have
remarked
how
much
sugar
there
was
in
the
silver
sugar
basin
it
was
quite
full
well
i
came
back
in
a
few
at
the
sugar
basin
and
little
wretched
lumps
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
basin
prince
she
was
all
alone
in
the
room
mind
now
that
woman
has
a
large
house
of
her
own
and
lots
of
money
of
course
this
is
merely
a
funny
you
can
judge
from
this
what
sort
of
people
one
has
to
deal
with
here
you
don
t
mean
it
said
the
prince
in
real
astonishment
what
a
woman
do
you
mean
to
say
she
ate
it
all
up
there
prince
and
that
s
your
charming
woman
what
do
you
think
of
nice
little
bit
of
conduct
i
think
i
should
have
died
of
shame
if
i
had
ever
allowed
myself
to
do
such
a
dirty
thing
as
that
but
do
you
know
she
is
a
real
all
the
same
what
natalia
dimitrievna
my
dear
prince
why
she
is
a
mere
tub
of
a
woman
oh
prince
prince
what
have
you
said
i
expected
far
better
taste
of
prince
of
course
but
she
s
a
figure
a
nice
figure
and
the
girl
who
a
nice
figure

very
nice
figure
of
a
what
sonia
why
she
s
a
mere
child
prince
she
s
only
thirteen
years
of
course
but
her
figure
very
charming
and
the
other
girl
she
s
she
s
dirty
might
have
washed
her
hands
but
very
charming
and
the
prince
raised
his
glass
again
and
hungrily
inspected
zina
quelle
charmante
personne
a
lovely
girl
he
muttered
melting
with
satisfaction

an
real
artiste
oh
if

continued
maria
alexandrovna
in
a
half
whisper
as
zina
rose
to
go
to
the
piano
with
her
stately
but
quiet
gait
and
queenly
composure
which
evidently
told
upon
the
old
man
if
you
only
knew
what
a
daughter
that
is
to
me
how
she
can
love
how
tender

observed
the
prince
staring
at
zina
all
the
while
with
the
whole
of
his
one
eye
as
if
he
would
like
to
eat
her
up
at
once
but
good
heavens
he
cried
that
song
i
know
that
i
heard
that
song
ago
oh
how
that
song
reminds
me
of
oh
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
ecstatic
state
of
the
prince
while
zina
sang
she
warbled
an
old
french
ballad
which
had
once
been
all
the
fashion
zina
sang
it
beautifully
her
lovely
face
her
glorious
eyes
her
fine
sweet
contralto
voice
all
this
went
to
the
prince
s
heart
at
once
and
her
dark
thick
hair
her
heaving
bosom
her
proud
beautiful
stately
figure
as
she
sat
at
the
piano
and
played
and
sang
quite
finished
him
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
he
panted
with
excitement
his
old
heart
partially
revivified
with
champagne
with
the
music
and
with
awakening
recollections
and
who
is
there
who
has
no
beloved
memories
of
the
past
his
old
heart
beat
faster
and
faster
it
was
long
since
it
had
last
beat
in
this
way
he
was
ready
to
fall
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
when
zina
stopped
singing
and
he
was
almost
in
tears
with
various
emotions
oh
my
charming
charming
child
he
cried
putting
his
lips
to
her
fingers
you
have
me
i
remember
all
now
oh
charming
charming
child
the
poor
prince
could
not
finish
his
sentence
maria
alexandrovna
felt
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
her
to
make
a
move
why
do
you
bury
yourself
alive
as
you
do
prince
she
began
solemnly
so
much
taste
so
much
vital
energy
so
many
rich
gifts
of
the
mind
and
to
hide
yourself
in
solitude
all
your
days
to
flee
from
mankind
from
your
friends
oh
it
is
unpardonable
prince
bethink
yourself
look
up
at
life
again
with
open
eyes
call
up
your
dear
memories
of
the
past
think
of
your
golden
golden
careless
happy
days
of
youth
wake
them
wake
them
from
the
dead
prince
and
wake
yourself
too
and
recommence
life
among
men
and
women
and
society
go
italy
to
spain
oh
to
spain
prince
you
must
have
a
guide
a
heart
that
will
love
and
respect
and
sympathize
with
you
you
have
friends
summon
them
about
you
give
the
word
and
they
will
rally
round
you
in
crowds
i
myself
will
be
the
first
to
throw
up
everything
and
answer
to
your
cry
i
remembered
our
old
friendship
my
prince
and
i
will
sacrifice
husband
home
all
and
follow
you
yes
and
were
i
but
young
and
lovely
like
my
daughter
here
i
would
be
your
fellow
your
friend
your
if
you
said
but
the
word
and
i
am
convinced
that
you
were
a
most
charming
creature
in
your
day
too
said
the
prince
blowing
his
nose
violently
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
we
live
again
in
our
children
said
maria
alexandrovna
with
great
feeling
i
too
have
my
guardian
angel
and
that
is
this
child
my
daughter
prince
the
partner
of
my
heart
and
of
all
my
thoughts
she
has
refused
seven
offers
because
she
is
unwilling
to
leave
me
so
that
she
will
go
too
when
you
accompany
me
in
that
case
i
shall
certainly
go
abroad
cried
the
prince
with
animation
i
shall
go
and
if
only
i
could
to
you
child
charming
child
and
the
prince
recommenced
to
kiss
zina
s
fingers
the
poor
old
man
was
evidently
meditating
going
down
on
his
knees
before
her
but
prince
began
maria
alexandrovna
again
feeling
that
the
opportunity
had
arrived
for
another
display
of
eloquence
but
prince
you
say
if
only
i
could
flatter
myself
into
indulging
any
hope
why
what
a
strange
man
you
are
prince
surely
you
do
not
suppose
that
you
are
unworthy
the
flattering
attention
of
woman
it
is
not
only
youth
that
constitutes
true
beauty
remember
that
you
are
so
to
speak
a
chip
of
the
tree
of
aristocracy
you
are
a
representative
of
all
the
most
knightly
most
refined
taste
and
culture
and
manners
did
not
maria
fall
in
love
with
the
old
man
mazeppa
i
remember
reading
that
lauzun
that
fascinating
marquis
of
the
court
of
louis
i
forget
which
when
he
was
an
old
bent
and
bowed
man
won
the
heart
of
one
of
the
youngest
and
most
beautiful
women
about
the
court
and
who
told
you
you
are
an
old
man
who
taught
you
that
nonsense
do
men
like
you
ever
grow
old
you
with
your
wealth
of
taste
and
wit
and
animation
and
vital
energy
and
brilliant
manners
just
you
make
your
appearance
at
some
abroad
with
a
young
wife
on
your
lovely
young
girl
like
my
zina
for
course
i
merely
mention
her
as
an
example
nothing
more
you
will
see
at
once
what
a
colossal
effect
you
will
produce
you
a
scion
of
our
aristocracy
she
a
beauty
among
beauties
you
will
lead
her
triumphantly
on
your
arm
she
perhaps
will
sing
in
some
brilliant
assemblage
you
will
delight
the
company
with
your
wit
why
all
the
people
of
the
place
will
crowd
to
see
you
all
europe
will
ring
with
your
renown
for
every
newspaper
and
feuilleton
at
the
waters
will
be
full
of
you
and
yet
you
say
if
i
could
but
to
indeed
the
feuilletons
and
the
newspapers
said
the
prince
growing
more
and
more
feeble
with
love
but
not
understanding
half
of
maria
alexandrovna
s
tall
talk
but
my
child
if
you
re
not
tired
do
repeat
that
song
which
you
have
just
sung
so
once
oh
but
prince
she
has
other
lovely
songs
still
prettier
ones
don
t
you

don
t
want

that
other
song
whined
the
prince
just
like
any
child
zina
sang
again
this
time
the
prince
could
not
contain
himself
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
her
feet
he
cried
he
sobbed
oh
my
beautiful
he
cried
in
his
shaky
old
with
old
age
and
emotion
combined
oh
my
charming
charming
oh
my
dear
child
you
have
me
of
so
much
that

long
long
passed
i
always

that

be
fairer
in
the
future
than
in
the
present
i
used
to
sing
duets
with
the
in
this
very
ballad
and
now
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to

the
prince
panted
and
choked
as
he
spoke
his
tongue
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
move
some
of
his
words
were
almost
unintelligible
it
was
clear
that
he
was
in
the
last
stage
of
emotional
excitement
maria
alexandrovna
immediately
poured
oil
on
the
fire
why
prince
i
do
believe
you
are
falling
in
love
with
my
zina
she
cried
feeling
that
the
moment
was
a
solemn
one
the
prince
s
reply
surpassed
her
fondest
expectations
i
am
madly
in
love
with
her
cried
the
old
man
all
animated
of
a
sudden
he
was
still
on
his
knees
and
he
trembled
with
excitement
as
he
spoke
i
am
ready
to
give
my
life
for
her
and
if
only
i
could
hope
if
only
i
might
have
a
little
lift
me
up
i
feel
so
weak
only
she
would
give
me
the
hope
that
i
might
offer
her
my
heart
should
sing
ballads
to
me
every
day
and
i
could
look
at
her
and
look
and
gaze
and
gaze
at
my
god
my
god
prince
prince
you
are
offering
her
your
hand
you
want
to
take
her
from
me
my
zina

darling

my

dear
child

t
let

must
tear
you
from
me
zina
they
must
tear
you
first
from
your
mother
s
arms
maria
alexandrovna
sprang
to
her
daughter
and
caught
her
up
in
a
close
embrace
conscious
withal
of
serious
physical
resistance
on
zina
s
part
the
fond
mother
was
a
little
overdoing
it
zina
felt
this
with
all
her
soul
and
she
looked
on
at
the
whole
comedy
with
inexpressible
loathing
however
she
held
her
tongue
and
that
was
all
the
fond
mother
required
of
her
she
has
refused
nine
men
because
she
will
not
leave
me
said
maria
but
this
time
i
heart
tells
me
that
we
are
doomed
to
part
i
noticed
just
now
how
she
looked
at
you
prince
you
have
impressed
her
with
your
aristocratic
manner
with
your
refinement
oh
prince
you
are
going
to
separate
feel
it
i
feel
it
i
her
murmured
the
poor
old
man
still
trembling
like
an
autumnal
leaf
and
you
ll
consent
to
leave
your
mother
cried
maria
alexandrovna
throwing
herself
upon
her
daughter
once
more
zina
made
haste
to
bring
this
to
her
painful
scene
to
an
end
she
stretched
her
pretty
hand
silently
to
the
prince
and
even
forced
herself
to
smile
the
prince
reverently
took
the
little
hand
into
his
own
and
covered
it
with
kisses
i
am
only
this
beginning
to
live
he
mutterred
in
a
voice
that
seemed
choking
with
rapture
and
ecstasy
zina
began
maria
alexandrovna
solemnly
look
well
at
this
man

is
the
most
honest
and
upright
and
noble
man
of
all
the
men
i

a
knight
of

middle

from

shall
remind
you
of
this
a
thousand
times
i
go
mad
when

of
that

was
stammered
the
prince
in
a
whining
voice
they
wanted
to
put
me
in
a
asylum

was
dreadfully
alarmed
in
a
lunatic
asylum

scoundrels

lunacy

in
these
people

the
poor
old
man
feebly
sinking
into
his
chair
i
was
at
a
ball
don
t
you
know
and
told
some
or
other
and
they
didn

scandal

murmured
the
prince
slowly
shutting
his
eyes
maria
alexandrovna
saw
that
her
work
was
done
the
prince
was
tired
out
with
love
and
emotion
she
was
only
wasting
her
eloquence
prince
you
are
disturbed
and
tired
i
see
you
are
she
said
you
must
rest
you
must
take
a
good
rest
after
so
much
agitation
she
added
bending
over
him
maternally
i
should
like
to
lie
down
a
little

the
old
man
of
course
of
course
you
must
lie
down
those
agitating
i
will
escort
you
myself
and
arrange
your
couch
with
my
own
hands
why
are
you
looking
so
hard
at
that
portrait
prince
that
is
my
mother
s
picture
she
was
an
a
woman
oh
why
is
she
not
among
us
at
this
joyful
moment
do
you
know
i
had
a
mother
too
princess
and
imagine
a
a
fat
woman
she
was
but
that
is
not
what
i
was
going
to
say
feel
a
little
weak
revoir
my
charming
revoir
au
revoir
here
the
poor
old
fellow
tried
to
kiss
his
hand
but
slipped
and
nearly
fell
over
the
threshold
of
the
door
take
care
dear
care
lean
on
my
arm
cried
maria
alexandrovna
charming
he
muttered
as
he
left
the
room
i
am
only
now
to
live
zina
was
left
alone
a
terrible
oppression
weighed
down
her
heart
she
felt
a
sensation
of
loathing
which
nearly
suffocated
her
she
despised
cheeks
burned
with
folded
hands
and
teeth
biting
hard
into
her
lips
she
stood
in
one
spot
motionless
the
tears
of
shame
streamed
from
her
eyes
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
paul
mosgliakoff
entered
the
room
chapter
ix
he
had
heard
he
did
not
actually
enter
the
room
but
stood
at
the
door
pale
with
excitement
and
fury
zina
looked
at
him
in
amazement
so
that
s
the
sort
of
person
you
are
he
cried
panting
at
last
i
have
found
you
out
have
i
found
me
out
repeated
zina
looking
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
madman
suddenly
her
eyes
flashed
with
rage
how
dare
you
address
me
like
that
she
cried
advancing
towards
him
i
have
heard
all
said
mosgliakoff
solemnly
but
involuntarily
taking
a
step
backwards
you
heard
i
have
been
eavesdropping
cried
zina
looking
at
him
with
disdain
yes
i
have
been
eavesdropping
consented
to
do
a
mean
action
and
my
reward
is
that
i
have
found
out
that
you
too
don
t
know
how
to
express
to
you
what
i
think
you
he
replied
looking
more
and
more
timid
under
zina
s
eyes
and
supposing
that
you
heard
all
what
right
have
you
to
blame
me
what
right
have
you
to
speak
to
me
so
insolently
in
any
case
what
right
have
and
can
ask
me
this
you
are
going
to
marry
this
prince
and
i
have
no
right
to
say
a
word
why
you
gave
me
your
that
nothing
when
how
when
did
not
i
tell
you
that
morning
when
you
came
to
me
with
your
sentimental
i
not
tell
you
that
i
could
give
you
no
decided
answer
but
you
did
not
reject
me
you
did
not
send
me
away
i
kept
me
hanging
in
reserve
in
case
of
need
you
lured
me
into
your
net
i
see
i
see
it
all
an
expression
of
pain
flitted
over
zina
s
careworn
face
as
though
someone
had
suddenly
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
but
she
mastered
her
feelings
if
i
didn
t
turn
you
out
of
the
house
she
began
deliberately
and
very
clearly
though
her
voice
had
a
scarcely
perceptible
tremor
in
it
i
refrained
from
such
a
course
purely
out
of
pity
you
begged
me
yourself
to
postpone
to
give
you
time
not
to
say
you
no
to
study
you
better
and
then
you
said
then
when
you
know
what
a
fine
fellow
i
am
perhaps
you
will
not
refuse
me
these
were
your
own
words
or
very
like
them
at
the
very
beginning
of
your
courtship
can
not
deny
them
and
now
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
i
lured
you
into
my
net
just
as
though
you
did
not
notice
my
expression
of
loathing
when
you
made
your
appearance
this
morning
you
came
a
fortnight
sooner
than
i
expected
you
and
i
did
not
hide
my
disgust
on
the
contrary
i
made
it
must
have
noticed
know
you
did
because
you
asked
me
whether
i
was
angry
because
you
had
come
sooner
than
you
promised
let
me
tell
you
that
people
who
do
not
and
do
not
to
hide
their
loathing
for
a
man
can
hardly
be
accused
of
luring
that
man
into
their
net
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
i
was
keeping
you
in
reserve
very
well
my
answer
to
that
is
that
i
judged
of
you
like
this
though
he
may
not
be
endowed
with
much
intellect
still
he
may
turn
out
to
be
a
good
enough
fellow
and
if
so
it
might
be
possible
to
marry
however
being
persuaded
now
that
you
are
a
fool
and
a
fool
into
the
bargain
found
out
this
fact
to
my
great
joy
only
remains
for
me
now
to
wish
you
every
happiness
and
a
pleasant
journey
with
these
words
zina
turned
her
back
on
him
and
deliberately
made
for
the
door
mosgliakoff
seeing
that
all
was
lost
boiled
over
with
fury
oh
so
i
m
a
fool
he
yelled
i
m
a
fool
am
i
very
well
but
before
i
go
the
whole
town
shall
know
of
this
they
shall
all
hear
how
you
and
your
mother
made
the
old
man
drunk
and
then
swindled
him
i
shall
let
the
whole
world
know
it
you
shall
see
what
mosgliakoff
can
do
zina
trembled
and
stopped
as
though
to
answer
but
on
reflection
she
contented
herself
by
shrugging
her
shoulders
glanced
contemptuously
at
mosgliakoff
and
left
the
room
banging
the
door
after
her
at
this
moment
maria
alexandrovna
made
her
appearance
she
heard
mosgliakoff
s
exclamation
and
divining
at
once
what
had
happened
trembled
with
terror
mosgliakoff
still
in
the
house
and
near
the
prince
mosgliakoff
about
to
spread
the
news
all
over
the
town
at
this
moment
when
secrecy
if
only
for
a
short
time
was
essential
but
maria
alexandrovna
was
quick
at
calculations
she
thought
with
an
eagle
flight
of
the
mind
over
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
her
plan
for
the
pacification
of
mosgliakoff
was
ready
in
an
instant
what
is
it
she
said
entering
the
room
and
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
with
friendly
warmth
cried
the
enraged
mosgliakoff
indeed
the
moment
after
you
have
abused
and
reviled
me
like
a
pickpocket
no
no
not
quite
so
green
my
good
lady
i
m
not
to
be
so
easily
imposed
upon
again
i
am
sorry
extremely
sorry
to
see
you
in
such
a
condition
of
mind
paul
alexandrovitch
what
expressions
you
use
you
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
choose
your
words
before
fie
before
ladies
ho
ho
are
anything
you
not
a
lady
yelled
mosgliakoff
i
don
t
quite
know
what
he
meant
but
it
was
something
very
terrible
you
may
be
sure
maria
alexandrovna
looked
benignly
in
his
face
sit
down
she
said
sorrowfully
showing
him
a
chair
the
same
that
the
old
prince
had
reclined
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
but
listen
you
listen
maria
alexandrovna
you
look
at
me
just
as
though
you
were
not
the
least
to
blame
in
fact
as
though
were
the
guilty
party
really
maria
alexandrovna
this
is
a
little
much
of
a
good
thing
no
human
being
can
stand
that
sort
of
thing
maria
alexandrovna
you
must
be
aware
of
that
fact
my
dear
friend
replied
maria
you
will
allow
me
to
continue
to
call
you
by
that
name
for
you
have
no
better
friend
than
i
am
friend
you
are
are
amazed
and
bewildered
your
heart
is
sore
and
therefore
the
tone
of
your
remarks
to
me
is
perhaps
not
surprising
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
open
my
heart
to
you
especially
as
i
am
perhaps
in
some
degree
to
blame
before
you
sit
down
let
us
talk
it
over
maria
alexandrovna
s
voice
was
tender
to
a
sickly
extent
her
face
showed
the
pain
she
was
suffering
the
amazed
mosgliakoff
sat
down
beside
her
in
the
you
hid
somewhere
and
listened
i
suppose
she
began
looking
reproachfully
into
his
face
yes
i
did
of
course
i
did
and
a
good
thing
too
what
a
fool
i
should
have
looked
if
i
hadn
t
at
all
events
now
i
know
what
you
have
been
plotting
against
me
replied
the
injured
man
rudely
encouraging
and
supporting
himself
by
his
own
fury
and
your
principles
and
with
your
bringing
up
could
condescend
to
such
an
oh
mosgliakoff
jumped
up
maria
alexandrovna
this
is
a
little
too
much
he
cried
consider
what
condescend
to
do
with
principles
and
judge
of
other
one
more
question
she
continued
without
replying
to
his
outburst
who
recommended
you
to
be
an
eavesdropper
who
told
you
anything
who
is
the
spy
here
that
s
what
i
wish
to
know
oh
excuse
me
that
i
shall
tell
you
very
well
i
know
already
i
said
paul
that
i
was
in
some
degree
to
blame
before
you
but
if
you
look
into
the
matter
you
will
find
that
if
i
am
to
blame
it
is
solely
in
consequence
of
my
anxiety
to
do
you
a
good
turn
a
good
no
no
madam
i
assure
you
i
am
not
to
be
caught
again
i
m
not
quite
such
a
fool
he
moved
so
violently
in
his
that
it
shook
again
now
do
be
cool
if
you
can
my
good
friend
listen
to
me
attentively
and
you
will
find
that
what
i
say
is
only
the
bare
truth
in
the
first
place
i
was
anxious
to
inform
you
of
all
that
has
just
taken
place
in
which
case
you
would
have
learned
everything
down
to
the
smallest
detail
without
being
obliged
to
descend
to
eavesdropping
if
i
did
not
tell
you
all
before
it
was
simply
because
the
whole
matter
was
in
an
embryo
condition
in
my
mind
it
was
then
quite
possible
that
what
happened
would
never
happen
you
see
i
am
quite
open
with
you
in
the
second
place
do
not
blame
my
daughter
she
loves
you
to
distraction
and
it
was
only
by
the
exercise
of
my
utmost
influence
that
i
persuaded
her
to
drop
you
and
accept
the
prince
s
i
have
just
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
convincing
proof
of
her
love
to
distraction
remarked
mosgliakoff
ironically
and
bitterly
very
well
but
how
did
you
speak
to
as
a
lover
should
speak
again
ought
man
of
respectable
position
and
tone
to
speak
like
that
you
insulted
and
wounded
her
never
mind
about
my
tone
now
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
morning
when
i
went
away
with
the
prince
in
spite
of
both
of
you
having
been
as
sweet
as
honey
to
me
before
you
reviled
me
behind
my
back
like
a
pickpocket
know
all
about
it
you
see
yes
from
the
same
dirty
source
i
suppose
said
maria
alexandrovna
smiling
disdainfully
yes
paul
i
revile
you
i
pitched
into
you
considerably
and
i
admit
it
frankly
but
it
was
simply
that
i
was
to
blacken
you
before
her
why
because
as
i
have
said
i
required
her
to
consent
to
leave
you
and
this
consent
was
so
difficult
to
tear
from
her
man
that
you
are
if
she
had
not
loved
you
why
should
i
have
required
so
to
blacken
your
character
why
should
i
have
been
obliged
to
take
this
extreme
step
oh
you
don
t
know
all
i
was
forced
to
use
my
fullest
maternal
authority
in
order
to
erase
you
from
her
heart
and
with
all
my
influence
and
skill
i
only
succeeded
in
erasing
your
dear
image
superficially
and
partially
if
you
saw
and
heard
all
just
now
it
can
not
have
escaped
you
that
zina
did
not
once
by
either
word
or
gesture
encourage
or
confirm
my
words
to
the
prince
throughout
the
whole
scene
she
said
not
one
word
she
sang
but
like
an
automaton
her
whole
soul
was
in
anguish
and
at
last
out
of
pity
for
her
i
took
the
prince
away
i
am
sure
she
cried
when
i
left
her
alone
when
you
entered
the
room
you
must
have
observed
tears
in
her
eyes
mosgliakoff
certainly
did
recall
the
fact
that
when
he
rushed
into
the
room
zina
was
crying
but
were
so
against
me
maria
alexandrovna
he
cried
why
did
you
revile
me
and
malign
me
as
you
admit
you
did
ah
now
that
s
quite
a
different
question
now
if
you
had
only
asked
me
reasonably
at
the
beginning
you
should
have
had
your
answer
long
ago
yes
you
are
right
it
was
i
and
i
alone
who
did
it
all
do
not
think
of
zina
in
the
matter
now
did
i
do
it
i
reply
in
the
first
place
for
zina
s
sake
the
prince
is
rich
influential
has
great
connections
and
in
marrying
him
zina
will
make
a
brilliant
match
very
well
then
if
the
prince
perhaps
he
will
die
soon
for
we
are
all
mortal
is
still
young
a
widow
a
princess
and
probably
very
rich
then
she
can
marry
whom
she
pleases
she
may
make
another
brilliant
match
if
she
likes
but
of
course
she
will
marry
the
man
she
loves
and
loved
before
the
man
whose
heart
she
wounded
by
accepting
the
prince
remorse
alone
would
be
enough
to
make
her
marry
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
and
so
deeply
injured
hem
said
paul
gazing
at
his
boots
thoughtfully
in
the
second
place
continued
maria
and
i
will
put
this
shortly
because
though
you
read
a
great
deal
of
your
beloved
shakespeare
and
extract
his
finest
thoughts
and
ideals
yet
you
are
very
young
and
can
not
perhaps
apply
what
you
read
you
may
not
understand
my
feelings
in
this
matter
listen
however
am
giving
my
zina
to
this
prince
partly
for
the
prince
s
own
sake
because
i
wish
to
save
him
by
this
marriage
we
are
old
friends
he
is
the
dearest
and
best
of
men
he
is
a
knightly
chivalrous
gentleman
and
he
lives
helpless
and
miserable
in
the
claws
of
that
devil
of
a
woman
at
donchanovo
heaven
knows
that
i
persuaded
zina
into
this
marriage
by
putting
it
to
her
that
she
would
be
performing
a
great
and
noble
action
i
represented
her
as
being
the
stay
and
the
comfort
and
the
darling
and
the
idol
of
a
poor
old
man
who
probably
would
not
live
another
year
at
the
most
i
showed
her
that
thus
his
last
days
should
be
made
happy
with
love
and
light
and
friendship
instead
of
wretched
with
fear
and
the
society
of
a
detestable
woman
oh
do
not
blame
zina
she
is
guiltless
i
am
admit
it
for
if
there
have
been
calculations
it
is
i
who
have
made
them
but
i
calculated
for
her
paul
for
her
not
myself
i
have
outlived
my
time
i
have
thought
but
for
my
child
and
what
mother
could
blame
me
for
this
tears
sparkled
in
the
fond
mother
s
eyes
mosgliakoff
listened
in
amazement
to
all
this
eloquence
winking
his
eyes
in
bewilderment
yes
yes
of
course
you
talk
well
maria
alexandrovna
but
you
gave
me
your
word
you
encouraged
me
you
gave
me
my
hopes
and
where
am
i
now
i
have
to
stand
aside
and
look
a
fool
but
my
dear
paul
you
don
t
surely
suppose
that
i
have
not
thought
of
you
too
don
t
you
see
the
huge
immeasurable
gain
to
yourself
in
all
this
a
gain
so
vast
that
i
was
bound
in
your
interest
to
act
as
i
did
gain
for
me
how
so
asked
paul
in
the
most
abject
state
of
confusion
and
bewilderment
gracious
heavens
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
really
so
simple
and
so
as
to
be
unable
to
see
cried
maria
alexandrovna
raising
her
eyes
to
the
ceiling
in
a
pious
manner
oh
youth
youth
that
s
what
comes
of
steeping
one
s
soul
in
shakespeare
you
ask
me
my
dear
friend
paul
where
is
the
gain
to
you
in
all
this
allow
me
to
make
a
little
digression
zina
loves
is
an
undoubted
fact
but
i
have
observed
that
at
the
same
time
and
in
spite
of
her
evident
love
she
is
not
quite
sure
of
your
good
feeling
and
devotion
to
her
and
for
this
reason
she
is
sometimes
cold
and
in
your
presence
have
you
never
observed
this
yourself
paul
certainly
i
did
this
very
day
but
go
on
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
fact
there
you
see
you
have
observed
it
yourself
then
of
course
i
am
right
she
is
not
quite
sure
of
the
quality
of
your
feeling
for
her
i
am
a
mother
and
i
may
be
permitted
to
read
the
heart
of
my
child
now
then
supposing
that
instead
of
rushing
into
the
room
and
reproaching
vilifying
even
at
and
insulting
this
sweet
pure
beautiful
proud
being
instead
of
hurling
contempt
and
vituperation
at
her
that
instead
of
all
this
you
had
received
the
bad
news
with
composure
with
tears
of
grief
maybe
perhaps
even
with
at
the
same
time
with
noble
composure
of
h
m
no
t
interrupt
me
i
wish
to
show
you
the
picture
as
it
is
very
well
supposing
then
that
you
had
come
to
her
and
said
zina
i
love
you
better
than
my
life
but
family
considerations
must
separate
us
i
understand
these
are
devised
for
your
greater
happiness
and
i
dare
not
oppose
them
zina
i
forgive
you
be
happy
if
you
can
what
effect
such
noble
words
would
have
wrought
upon
her
heart
that
s
all
very
true
i
quite
understand
that
much
but
if
i
said
all
this
i
should
have
had
to
go
all
the
same
without
satisfaction
no
no
no
don
t
interrupt
me
i
wish
to
show
you
the
picture
in
all
its
detail
in
order
to
impress
you
fully
and
satisfactorily
very
well
then
imagine
now
that
you
meet
her
in
society
some
time
afterwards
you
meet
perhaps
at
a
the
brilliant
light
of
a
under
the
soothing
strains
of
music
and
in
the
midst
of
worldly
women
and
of
all
that
is
gay
and
beautiful
you
alone
are
lean
against
some
pillar
where
you
are
visible
however
and
watch
her
she
is
dancing
you
hear
the
strains
of
strauss
and
the
wit
and
merriment
around
you
but
you
are
sad
and
wretched
what
think
you
will
zina
make
of
it
with
what
sort
of
eyes
will
she
gaze
on
you
as
you
stand
there
and
i
could
doubt
this
man
she
will
think
this
man
who
sacrificed
all
all
for
my
to
the
mortal
wounding
of
his
heart
of
course
the
old
love
will
awake
in
her
bosom
and
will
swell
with
irresistible
power
maria
alexandrovna
stopped
to
take
breath
paul
moved
violently
from
side
to
side
of
his
chair
zina
now
goes
abroad
for
the
benefit
of
the
prince
s
spain
she
continued
where
the
myrtle
and
the
lemon
tree
grow
where
the
sky
is
so
blue
the
beautiful
guadalquiver
flows
to
the
land
of
love
where
none
can
live
without
loving
where
roses
and
to
in
the
very
air
around
you
follow
sacrifice
your
business
friends
everything
and
follow
her
and
so
your
love
grows
and
increases
with
irresistible
might
of
course
that
love
is
will
languish
for
one
will
meet
frequently
of
course
others
will
malign
and
vilify
you
both
and
call
your
love
by
baser
your
love
is
innocent
as
i
have
purposely
said
i
am
her
is
not
for
me
to
teach
you
evil
but
good
at
all
events
the
prince
is
not
in
the
condition
to
keep
a
very
sharp
upon
you
but
if
he
did
as
if
there
would
be
the
slightest
ground
for
base
suspicion
well
the
prince
dies
at
last
and
then
who
will
marry
zina
if
not
yourself
you
are
so
distant
a
relative
of
the
prince
s
that
there
could
be
no
obstacle
to
the
match
you
marry
is
young
still
and
rich
you
are
a
grandee
in
an
instant
you
too
are
rich
now
i
will
take
care
that
the
prince
s
will
is
made
as
it
should
be
and
lastly
zina
now
convinced
of
your
loyalty
and
faithfulness
will
look
on
you
hereafter
as
her
hero
as
her
paragon
of
virtue
and
oh
you
must
be
blind
not
to
observe
and
calculate
your
own
profit
when
it
lies
but
a
couple
of
strides
from
you
grinning
at
you
as
it
were
and
saying
here
i
am
yours
take
me
oh
paul
paul
maria
alexandrovna
cried
mosgliakoff
in
great
agitation
and
excitement
i
see
it
all
i
have
been
rude
and
a
fool
and
a
scoundrel
too
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
tore
his
hair
yes
and
unbusinesslike
that
s
the
chief
and
blindly
so
added
maria
alexandrovna
i
m
an
ass
maria
alexandrovna
he
cried
in
despair
all
is
lost
now
and
i
loved
her
to
madness
maybe
all
is
not
lost
yet
said
this
successful
orator
softly
and
as
though
thinking
out
some
idea
oh
if
only
it
could
be
so
help
me
oh
save
me
save
me
mosgliakoff
burst
into
tears
my
dear
boy
said
maria
alexandrovna
sympathetically
and
holding
out
her
hand
you
acted
impulsively
from
the
depth
and
heat
of
your
fact
out
of
your
great
love
for
her
you
were
in
despair
you
had
forgotten
yourself
she
must
understand
all
that
oh
i
love
her
madly
i
am
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
her
cried
mosgliakoff
listen
i
will
justify
you
before
oh
maria
alexandrovna
yes
i
will
i
take
it
upon
myself
you
come
with
me
and
you
shall
tell
her
exactly
what
i
said
oh
how
kind
how
good
you
are
can
t
we
go
at
once
maria
alexandrovna
goodness
gracious
no
what
a
very
green
hand
you
are
paul
she
s
far
too
proud
she
would
take
it
as
a
new
rudeness
and
impertinence
i
shall
arrange
it
all
comfortably
for
you
but
now
couldn
t
you
get
out
of
the
way
somewhere
for
a
while
to
that
godfather
of
yours
for
instance
you
could
come
back
in
the
evening
if
you
pleased
but
my
advice
would
be
to
stay
away
yes
yes
i
ll
course
good
heavens
you
ve
made
a
man
of
me
again
but
look
more
question
if
the
prince
does
die
so
soon
oh
my
dear
boy
how
delightfully
naïve
you
are
on
the
contrary
we
must
pray
for
his
good
health
we
must
wish
with
all
our
hearts
for
long
life
to
this
dear
good
and
chivalrous
old
man
i
shall
be
the
first
to
pray
day
and
night
for
the
happiness
of
my
beloved
daughter
but
alas
i
fear
the
prince
s
case
is
hopeless
you
see
they
must
visit
the
capital
now
to
bring
zina
out
into
dreadfully
fear
that
all
this
may
prove
fatal
to
him
however
we
ll
pray
paul
we
can
t
do
more
and
the
rest
is
in
the
hands
of
a
kind
providence
you
see
what
i
mean
very
my
dear
boy
bless
you
be
a
man
and
wait
a
man
that
s
the
chief
thing
i
never
doubted
your
generosity
of
character
but
be
she
pressed
his
hand
warmly
and
mosgliakoff
walked
out
of
the
room
on
there
goes
fool
got
rid
of
satisfactorily
observed
maria
alexandrovna
to
herself
but
there
are
more
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
zina
entered
the
room
she
was
paler
than
usual
and
her
eyes
were
all
ablaze
mamma
she
said
be
quick
about
this
business
or
i
shall
not
be
able
to
hold
out
it
is
all
so
dirty
and
mean
that
i
feel
i
must
run
out
of
the
house
if
it
goes
on
don
t
drive
me
to
desperation
i
warn
t
weary
me
t
weary
me
out
is
it
my
darling
ve
been
listening
cried
maria
alexandrovna
gazing
intently
and
anxiously
at
her
daughter
yes
i
have
but
you
need
not
try
to
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
as
you
succeeded
in
doing
with
that
fool
now
listen
i
solemnly
swear
that
if
you
worry
and
annoy
me
by
making
me
play
various
mean
and
odious
parts
in
this
comedy
of
yours
swear
to
you
that
i
will
throw
up
the
whole
business
and
put
an
end
to
it
in
a
moment
it
is
quite
enough
that
i
have
consented
to
be
a
party
in
the
main
and
essence
of
the
base
transactions
did
not
know
myself
i
am
poisoned
and
suffocated
with
the
stench
of
it
saying
she
left
the
room
and
banged
the
door
after
her
maria
alexandrovna
looked
fixedly
after
her
for
a
moment
and
reflected
i
must
make
haste
she
cried
rousing
herself
is
the
greatest
danger
and
difficulty
of
all
if
these
detestable
people
do
not
let
us
alone
instead
of
acting
the
all
over
the
place
as
i
fear
they
are
doing
already
will
be
lost
she
won
t
stand
the
worry
of
ll
drop
the
business
altogether
all
hazards
i
must
get
the
prince
to
the
country
house
and
that
quickly
too
i
shall
be
off
there
at
once
first
and
bring
my
fool
of
a
husband
up
he
shall
be
made
useful
for
once
in
his
life
meanwhile
the
prince
shall
have
his
sleep
out
and
when
he
wakes
up
i
shall
be
back
and
ready
to
cart
him
away
bodily
she
rang
the
bell
are
the
horses
ready
she
inquired
of
the
man
yes
madam
long
ago
said
the
latter
she
had
ordered
the
carriage
the
moment
after
she
had
taken
the
prince
upstairs
maria
alexandrovna
dressed
hurriedly
and
then
looked
in
at
zina
s
room
for
a
moment
before
starting
in
order
to
tell
her
the
outlines
of
her
plan
of
operations
and
at
the
same
time
to
give
zina
a
few
necessary
instructions
but
her
daughter
could
not
listen
to
her
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
with
face
hidden
in
the
pillows
crying
and
was
tearing
her
beautiful
hair
with
her
long
white
hands
occasionally
she
trembled
violently
for
a
moment
as
though
a
blast
of
cold
had
passed
through
all
her
veins
her
mother
began
to
speak
to
her
but
zina
did
not
even
raise
her
head
having
stood
over
her
daughter
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
for
some
little
while
maria
alexandrovna
left
the
room
and
to
make
up
for
lost
time
bade
the
coachman
drive
like
fury
as
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
i
don
t
quite
like
zina
having
listened
she
thought
as
she
rattled
away
i
gave
mosgliakoff
very
much
the
same
argument
as
to
herself
she
is
proud
and
may
easily
have
taken
offence
h
m
well
the
great
thing
is
to
be
in
time
with
all
the
arrangements
people
know
what
i
am
up
to
good
heavens
fancy
if
my
fool
of
a
husband
were
to
be
out
and
at
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
maria
alexandrovna
s
rage
so
overcame
her
that
it
was
clear
her
poor
husband
would
fare
badly
for
his
sins
if
he
proved
to
be
not
at
home
she
twisted
and
turned
in
her
place
with
impatience
horses
almost
galloped
with
the
carriage
at
their
heels
chapter
x
on
they
flew
i
have
said
already
that
this
very
day
on
her
first
drive
after
the
prince
maria
alexandrovna
had
been
inspired
with
a
great
idea
and
i
promised
to
reveal
this
idea
in
its
proper
place
but
i
am
sure
the
reader
has
guessed
it
already
was
to
confiscate
the
prince
in
her
turn
and
carry
him
off
to
the
village
where
at
this
moment
her
husband
afanassy
matveyevitch
vegetated
alone
i
must
admit
that
our
heroine
was
growing
more
and
more
anxious
as
the
day
went
on
but
this
is
often
the
case
with
heroes
of
all
kinds
just
before
they
attain
their
great
ends
some
such
instinct
whispered
to
her
that
it
was
not
safe
to
remain
in
mordasoff
another
hour
if
it
could
be
avoided
once
in
the
country
house
the
whole
town
might
go
mad
and
stand
on
its
head
for
all
she
cared
of
course
she
must
not
lose
time
even
there
all
sorts
of
things
might
the
police
might
interfere
reader
i
shall
never
believe
for
my
part
that
my
heroine
really
had
the
slightest
fear
of
the
vulgar
police
force
but
as
it
has
been
rumoured
in
mordasoff
that
at
this
moment
such
a
thought
pass
through
her
brain
why
i
must
record
the
fact
in
a
word
she
saw
clearly
that
zina
s
marriage
with
the
prince
must
be
brought
about
at
once
without
delay
it
was
easily
done
the
priest
at
the
village
should
perform
the
ceremony
why
not
the
day
after
or
indeed
in
case
of
need
marriages
had
often
been
brought
about
in
less
time
than
two
hours
she
had
heard
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
persuade
the
prince
that
haste
and
simplicity
would
be
in
far
better
taste
than
all
the
usual
pomps
and
vanities
of
common
everyday
weddings
in
fact
she
relied
upon
her
skill
in
putting
the
matter
to
the
old
man
as
a
fitting
dramatic
issue
to
a
romantic
story
of
love
and
thus
to
touch
the
most
sensitive
string
of
his
chivalrous
heart
in
case
of
absolute
need
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
making
him
drunk
or
rather
of
him
perpetually
drunk
and
then
come
what
might
zina
would
be
a
princess
and
if
this
marriage
were
fated
to
produce
scandal
among
the
prince
s
relations
and
friends
in
petersburg
and
moscow
maria
alexandrovna
comforted
herself
with
the
reflection
that
marriages
in
high
life
nearly
always
productive
of
scandal
and
that
such
a
result
might
fairly
be
looked
upon
as
good
form
and
as
peculiar
to
aristocratic
circles
besides
she
felt
sure
that
zina
need
only
show
herself
in
society
with
her
mamma
to
support
her
and
every
one
of
all
those
countesses
and
princes
should
very
soon
either
acknowledge
her
of
their
own
accord
or
yield
to
the
that
maria
alexandrovna
felt
herself
so
competent
to
give
to
any
or
all
of
them
individually
or
collectively
it
was
in
consequence
of
these
reflections
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
now
hastening
with
all
speed
towards
her
village
in
order
to
bring
back
afanassy
matveyevitch
whose
presence
she
considered
absolutely
necessary
at
this
crisis
it
was
desirable
that
her
husband
should
appear
and
invite
the
prince
down
to
the
country
she
relied
upon
the
appearance
of
the
father
of
the
family
in
and
white
tie
hastening
up
to
town
on
the
first
rumours
of
the
prince
s
arrival
there
to
produce
a
very
favourable
impression
upon
the
old
man
s
it
would
flatter
him
and
after
such
a
courteous
action
followed
by
a
polite
and
invitation
to
the
country
the
prince
would
hardly
refuse
to
go
at
last
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
long
low
wooden
house
surrounded
by
old
lime
trees
this
was
the
country
house
maria
alexandrovna
s
village
residence
lights
were
burning
inside
where
s
my
old
fool
cried
maria
alexandrovna
bursting
like
a
hurricane
into
the
whats
this
towel
lying
here
for
s
been
wiping
his
head
has
he
what
the
baths
again
and
course
tea
tea
well
what
are
you
winking
your
eyes
at
me
for
you
old
fool
why
is
his
hair
not
cropped
grisha
grisha
why
didn
t
you
cut
your
master
s
hair
as
i
told
you
maria
alexandrovna
on
entering
the
room
had
intended
to
greet
her
husband
more
kindly
than
this
but
seeing
that
he
had
just
been
to
the
baths
and
that
he
was
drinking
tea
with
great
satisfaction
as
usual
she
could
not
restrain
her
irritable
feelings
she
felt
the
contrast
between
her
own
activity
and
intellectual
energy
and
the
stolid
indifference
and
contentedness
of
her
husband
and
it
went
to
her
heart
meanwhile
the
old
fool
or
to
put
it
more
politely
he
who
had
been
addressed
by
that
title
sat
at
the
and
stared
with
open
mouth
in
abject
alarm
opening
and
shutting
his
lips
as
he
gazed
at
the
wife
of
his
bosom
who
had
almost
petrified
him
by
her
sudden
appearance
at
the
door
stood
the
sleepy
fat
grisha
looking
on
at
the
scene
and
blinking
both
eyes
at
periodical
intervals
i
couldn
t
cut
his
hair
as
you
wished
because
he
wouldn
t
let
me
he
growled
at
last
you
d
better
let
me
do
it
said
or
the
mistress
ll
be
down
one
of
these
days
and
then
we
shall
both
catch
it
no
he
says
i
want
it
like
this
now
and
you
shall
cut
it
on
sunday
i
like
it
long
what
you
wish
to
curl
it
without
my
leave
do
you
what
an
if
you
could
wear
curls
with
your
underneath
good
gracious
what
a
mess
you
ve
made
of
the
place
and
what
s
the
have
you
been
doing
idiot
eh
cried
maria
alexandrovna
waxing
more
and
more
angry
and
turning
furiously
upon
the
wretched
and
perfectly
innocent
afanassy
muttered
the
poor
frightened
master
of
the
house
gazing
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
mistress
and
blinking
with
all
his
mammy
how
many
times
have
i
dinned
into
your
stupid
head
that
i
am
your
how
can
i
be
your
mammy
you
idiotic
pigmy
how
dare
you
call
a
noble
lady
by
such
a
name
a
lady
whose
proper
place
is
in
the
highest
circles
not
beside
an
ass
like
yourself
you
my
legal
wife
you
know
after
all
was
husbandly
affection
you
murmured
poor
afanassy
raising
both
hands
to
his
head
as
he
spoke
to
defend
his
hair
from
the
tugs
he
evidently
expected
oh
idiot
that
you
are
did
anyone
ever
hear
such
a
ridiculous
answer
as
wife
indeed
who
ever
heard
the
expression
wife
in
good
low
expression
and
how
dare
you
remind
me
that
i
am
your
wife
when
i
use
all
my
power
and
do
all
i
possibly
can
at
every
moment
to
forget
the
fact
eh
what
are
you
covering
your
head
with
your
hands
for
look
at
his
wet
as
wet
as
reeds
it
will
take
three
hours
to
dry
that
head
how
on
earth
am
i
to
take
him
like
this
how
can
he
show
his
face
among
respectable
people
what
am
i
to
do
and
maria
alexandrovna
bit
her
with
rage
as
she
walked
furiously
up
and
down
the
room
it
was
no
very
great
matter
of
course
and
one
that
was
easily
set
right
but
maria
alexandrovna
required
a
vent
for
her
feelings
and
felt
the
need
of
emptying
out
her
accumulated
wrath
upon
the
head
of
the
wretched
afanassy
matveyevitch
for
tyranny
is
a
habit
recallable
at
need
besides
everyone
knows
how
great
a
contrast
there
is
between
the
sweetness
and
refinement
shown
by
many
ladies
of
a
certain
class
on
the
stage
as
it
were
of
society
life
and
the
revelations
of
character
behind
the
scenes
at
home
and
i
was
anxious
to
bring
out
this
contrast
for
my
reader
s
benefit
afanassy
watched
the
movements
of
his
terrible
spouse
in
fear
and
trembling
perspiration
formed
upon
his
brow
as
he
gazed
grisha
she
cried
at
last
dress
your
master
this
instant
black
trousers
white
waistcoat
and
tie
quick
where
s
his
quick
why
i
ve
just
been
to
the
bath
i
shall
catch
cold
if
i
go
up
to
town
just
now
you
won
t
catch
cold
my
hair
s
quite
wet
we
ll
dry
it
in
a
minute
here
grisha
take
this
brush
and
brush
away
till
he
s
dry
harder
there
that
s
better
grisha
worked
like
a
man
for
the
greater
convenience
of
his
herculean
task
he
seized
his
master
s
shoulder
with
one
hand
as
he
rubbed
violently
with
the
other
poor
afanassy
grunted
and
groaned
and
almost
wept
now
then
lift
him
up
a
bit
where
s
the
pomatum
bend
your
head
duffer
lower
you
abject
dummy
and
maria
alexandrovna
herself
undertook
to
pomade
her
husband
s
hair
ploughing
her
hands
through
it
without
the
slightest
pity
afanassy
heartily
wished
that
his
shock
growth
had
been
cut
he
winced
and
groaned
and
moaned
but
did
not
cry
out
under
the
painful
operation
you
suck
my
out
of
lower
you
idiot
remarked
the
fond
bend
lower
still
i
tell
you
how
have
i
sucked
your
life
blood
asked
the
victim
bending
his
head
as
low
as
circumstances
permitted
fool
of
t
you
understand
now
then
comb
it
yourself
here
grisha
dress
him
quick
our
heroine
threw
herself
into
an
and
critically
watched
the
ceremony
of
adorning
her
husband
meanwhile
the
latter
had
a
little
opportunity
to
get
his
breath
once
more
and
compose
his
feelings
generally
so
that
when
matters
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
tie
is
tied
he
had
even
developed
so
much
audacity
as
to
express
opinions
of
his
own
as
to
how
the
bow
should
be
manufactured
at
last
having
put
his
on
the
lord
of
the
manor
was
his
brave
self
again
and
gazed
at
his
highly
ornate
person
in
the
glass
with
great
satisfaction
and
complacency
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
to
he
now
asked
smiling
at
his
reflected
self
maria
alexandrovna
could
not
believe
her
ears
how
you
ask
me
where
i
am
taking
you
to
sir
must
know
you
hold
your
tongue
you
let
me
hear
you
call
me
mammy
again
especially
where
we
are
going
to
now
you
sha
n
t
have
any
tea
for
a
month
the
frightened
consort
held
his
peace
look
at
that
now
you
haven
t
got
a
single
order
to
put
she
continued
looking
at
his
black
coat
with
contempt
the
government
awards
orders
mammy
and
i
am
not
a
sloven
but
a
town
councillor
said
afanassy
with
a
sudden
excess
of
noble
wrath
what
so
you
ve
learned
to
argue
now
have
mongrel
you
however
i
haven
t
time
to
waste
over
you
now
or
i
i
sha
n
t
forget

grisha
give
him
his
fur
coat
and
his
and
look

these
three
rooms
ready
and
the
green
room
and
the
corner

the
coverings
off
the
and
clocks
and
see
that
all
is
ready
and
tidy
within
an
hour
put
on
a
dress
coat
and
see
that
the
other
men
have
gloves
don
t
lose
time
quick
now
she
entered
the
carriage
followed
by
afanassy
the
latter
sat
bewildered
and
lost
meanwhile
maria
alexandrovna
reflected
as
to
how
best
she
could
drum
into
her
husband
s
thick
skull
certain
essential
instructions
with
regard
to
the
present
situation
of
affairs
but
afanassy
anticipated
her
i
had
a
very
original
dream
maria
alexandrovna
he
observed
quite
unexpectedly
in
the
middle
of
a
long
silence
tfu
idiot
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
something
of
terrific
interest
from
the
look
of
you
dream
indeed
how
dare
you
mention
your
miserable
dreams
to
me
original
too
listen
here
if
you
dare
so
much
as
remind
me
of
the
word

or
say
anything
else

where
we
are
going
don
t
know
i
won
t
do
to
you

my
house

honour

you
are
to
invite
him
with
all
the
amiability
you
can
to
come
down
to
our
house
in
the
country
at
once
that
is
what
i
am
taking
you
up
for
and
if
you

so
much
as
breathe

any
kind

leave
from
me
you
shall
herd

for
a
whole
year

not
to
say
a
single
word

and
that
s
all
you
have
to
think
of
do
you
understand
now
well
but
if
i
m
asked
anything
hold
your
tongue
all
the
same
oh
but
i
can
t
do
can
t
very
well
then
you
can
say
h
m
or
something
of
that
sort
to
give
them
the
idea
that
you
are
very
wise
indeed
and
like
to
think
well
before
h
understand
me
now
i
am
taking
you
up
because
you
are
to
make
it
appear
that
you
have
just
heard
of
the
prince
s
visit
and
have
hastened
up
to
town
in
a
transport
of
joy
to
express
your
unbounded
respect
and
gratitude
to
him
and
to
invite
him
at
once
to
your
country
house
do
you
understand
me

him
how

ask
questions
why

i
to
invite
him
if
i
must
not
say
a
word
oh
i

to
bow
do
you
hear
and
hold
your
hat
in
your
hand
and
look
polite
do
you
understand
or
not
i
understand
the
prince
is
very
witty
indeed
so
mind
if
he
says
anything
either
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
you
are
to
laugh
cordially
and
merrily
do
you
hear
me
h
don
t
say
h
m
to
i
tell
you
you
are
to
answer
me
plainly
and
simply
do
you
hear
me
or
not
yes
yes
i
hear
you
of
course
that
s
all
right
i
only
say
h
m
for
practice
i
want
to
get
into
the
way
of
saying
it
but
look
here
mammy
it
s
all
very
well
you
say
i
m
not
to
speak
and
if
he
speaks
to
me
i
m
to
look
at
him
and
what
if
he
asks
me
a
question
dense
log
of
a
man
i
tell
you
again
you
are
to
be
quiet
answer
for
you
you
have
simply
got
to
look
polite
and
smile
but
he
ll
think
i
am
dumb
said
afanassy
well
and
what
if
he
does
let
him
you
ll
conceal
the
fact
that
you
are
a
fool
anyhow
h
m
and
if
people
ask
me
questions
no
one
will
there
ll
be
no
one
to
ask
you
but
if
there
be
anyone
else
in
the
room
and
they
ask
you
questions
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
smile
sarcastically
do
you
know
what
a
sarcastic
smile
is
what
a
witty
sort
of
smile
is
it
mammy
i
ll
let
you
know
about
it
indeed
why
who
would
think
of
expecting
anything
witty
from
a
fool
like
you
no
sir
a
jesting
and
h
good
heavens
i
m
afraid
for
this
idiot
thought
maria
alexandrovna
to
herself
i
really
think
it
would
have
been
almost
better
to
leave
him
behind
after
so
thinking
nervous
and
anxious
maria
alexandrovna
drove
on
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
she
fidgeted
and
she
bustled
the
coachman
up
the
horses
were
almost
flying
through
the
air
but
to
her
they
appeared
to
be
crawling
afanassy
sat
silent
and
thoughtful
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
practising
his
lessons
at
last
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
town
house
hardly
however
had
maria
alexandrovna
mounted
the
outer
steps
when
she
became
aware
of
a
fine
pair
of
horses
trotting
a
smart
sledge
with
a
hood
to
it
in
fact
the
very
in
which
anna
nicolaevna
antipova
was
generally
to
be
seen
two
ladies
sat
in
the
sledge
one
of
these
was
of
course
antipova
herself
the
other
was
natalia
dimitrievna
of
late
the
great
friend
and
ally
of
the
former
lady
maria
alexandrovna
s
heart
sank
but
she
had
no
time
to
say
a
word
before
another
smart
vehicle
drove
up
in
which
there
reclined
yet
another
guest
exclamations
of
joy
and
delight
were
now
heard
maria
alexandrovna
and
afanassy
matveyevitch
just
arrived
too
where
from
how
extremely
delightful
and
here
we
are
you
see
just
driven
up
at
the
right
moment
we
are
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
you
what
a
delightful
the
guests
alighted
and
fluttered
up
the
steps
like
so
many
swallows
maria
alexandrovna
could
neither
believe
her
eyes
nor
her
ears
curse
you
all
she
said
to
herself
this
looks
like
a
must
be
seen
to
but
it
takes
more
than
a
flight
of
magpies
like
to
get
to
windward
of
wait
a
little
chapter
xi
mosgliakoff
went
out
from
maria
alexandrovna
s
house
to
all
appearances
quite
pacified
she
had
fired
his
ardour
completely
his
imagination
was
kindled
he
did
not
go
to
his
godfather
s
for
he
felt
the
need
of
solitude
a
terrific
rush
of
heroic
and
romantic
thoughts
surged
over
him
and
gave
him
no
rest
he
pictured
to
himself
the
solemn
explanation
he
should
have
with
zina
then
the
generous
throbs
of
his
heart
his
pallor
and
despair
at
the
future
ball
in
petersburg
then
spain
the
guadalquiver
and
love
and
the
old
dying
prince
joining
their
hands
with
his
last
blessing
then
came
thoughts
of
his
beautiful
wife
devoted
to
himself
and
never
ceasing
to
wonder
at
and
admire
her
husband
s
heroism
and
exalted
refinement
of
taste
and
conduct
then
among
other
things
the
attention
which
he
should
attract
among
the
ladies
of
the
highest
circles
into
which
he
would
of
course
enter
thanks
to
his
marriage
with
of
the
prince
then
the
inevitable
appointments
first
as
a
with
the
delightful
accompaniment
of
salary
in
a
word
all
that
maria
alexandrovna
s
eloquence
had
pictured
to
his
imagination
now
marched
in
triumphant
procession
through
his
brain
soothing
and
attracting
and
flattering
his
and
i
really
can
not
explain
this
phenomenon
however
yet
no
sooner
did
the
first
flush
of
this
delightful
sunrise
of
future
delights
pass
off
and
fade
away
than
the
annoying
thought
struck
him
this
is
all
very
well
but
it
is
in
the
future
and
now
i
shall
look
a
dreadful
fool
as
he
reflected
thus
he
looked
up
and
found
that
he
had
wandered
a
long
way
to
some
of
the
dirty
back
slums
of
the
town
a
wet
snow
was
falling
now
and
again
he
met
another
belated
pedestrian
like
himself
the
outer
circumstances
began
to
anger
mosgliakoff
which
was
a
bad
sign
for
when
things
are
going
well
with
us
we
are
always
inclined
to
see
everything
in
a
light
paul
could
not
help
remembering
that
up
to
now
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
cutting
a
dash
at
mordasoff
he
had
enjoyed
being
treated
at
all
the
houses
he
went
to
in
the
town
as
zina
s
accepted
lover
and
to
be
congratulated
as
he
often
was
upon
the
honour
of
that
distinction
he
was
proud
of
being
her
future
husband
and
here
he
was
now
with
notice
to
quit
he
would
be
laughed
at
he
couldn
t
tell
everybody
about
the
future
scene
in
the
at
petersburg
and
the
guadalquiver
and
all
that
and
then
a
thought
came
out
into
prominence
which
had
been
uncomfortably
fidgeting
about
in
his
brain
for
some
time
was
it
all
true
it
really
come
about
as
maria
alexandrovna
had
predicted
here
it
struck
him
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
an
amazingly
cunning
woman
that
however
worthy
she
might
be
of
universal
esteem
still
she
was
a
known
and
lied
from
morning
to
night
that
again
she
probably
had
some
good
reason
for
wishing
him
out
of
the
place
he
next
bethought
him
of
zina
and
of
her
parting
look
at
him
which
was
very
far
from
being
expressive
of
passionate
love
he
remembered
also
that
less
than
an
hour
ago
she
had
called
him
a
fool
as
he
thought
of
the
last
fact
paul
stopped
in
his
tracks
as
though
shot
blushed
and
almost
cried
for
very
shame
at
this
very
moment
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
his
footing
on
the
slippery
pavement
and
to
go
into
a
as
he
stood
shaking
himself
dry
a
whole
troop
of
dogs
which
had
long
trotted
barking
at
his
heels
flew
at
him
one
of
them
a
wretched
little
beast
went
so
far
as
to
fix
her
teeth
into
his
fur
coat
and
hang
therefrom
swearing
and
striking
out
paul
cleared
his
way
out
of
the
yelping
pack
at
last
in
a
fury
and
with
rent
clothes
and
making
his
way
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
corner
of
the
street
discovered
that
he
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
where
he
was
he
walked
up
lanes
and
down
streets
and
round
corners
and
lost
himself
more
and
more
hopelessly
also
his
temper
the
devil
take
all
these
confounded
exalted
ideas
he
growled
half
aloud
and
the
archfiend
take
every
one
of
you
you
and
your
guadalquivers
and
humbug
mosgliakoff
was
not
in
a
pretty
humour
at
this
moment
at
last
tired
and
horribly
angry
after
two
hours
of
walking
he
reached
the
door
of
maria
alexandrovna
s
house
observing
a
host
of
carriages
standing
outside
he
paused
to
consider
surely
she
has
not
a
party
he
thought
and
if
she
has
has
she
a
party
he
inquired
of
the
servants
and
found
out
that
maria
alexandrovna
had
been
out
of
town
and
had
fetched
up
afanassy
matveyevitch
gorgeous
in
his
and
white
tie
he
learned
further
that
the
prince
was
awake
but
had
not
as
yet
made
his
appearance
in
the
on
receiving
this
information
paul
mosgliakoff
said
not
a
word
but
quietly
made
his
way
upstairs
to
his
uncle
s
room
he
was
in
that
frame
of
mind
in
which
a
man
determines
to
commit
some
desperate
act
out
of
revenge
aware
at
the
time
and
wide
awake
to
the
fact
that
he
is
about
to
do
the
deed
but
forgetting
entirely
that
he
may
very
likely
regret
it
all
his
life
afterwards
entering
the
prince
s
room
he
found
that
worthy
seated
before
the
glass
with
a
perfectly
bare
head
but
with
whiskers
and
napoleon
stuck
on
his
wig
was
in
the
hands
of
his
old
and
grey
valet
his
favourite
ivan
pochomitch
and
the
latter
was
gravely
and
thoughtfully
combing
it
out
as
for
the
prince
he
was
indeed
a
pitiable
object
he
was
not
half
awake
yet
for
one
thing
he
sat
as
though
he
were
still
dazed
with
sleep
he
kept
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
and
stared
at
mosgliakoff
as
though
he
did
not
know
him
well
how
are
you
uncle
asked
mosgliakoff
what
it
s
you
is
it
said
the
prince
i
ve
been
a
little
while
oh
heavens
he
cried
suddenly
with
great
animation
why
i
ve
got
no
on
oh
never
mind
that
uncle
i
ll
help
you
on
with
it
if
you
like
dear
me
now
you
ve
found
out
my
i
told
him
to
shut
the
door
now
my
friend
you
must
give
me
your
word
that
you
ll
never
breathe
a
hint
of
this
to
mean
about
my
hair
being
oh
uncle
as
if
i
could
be
guilty
of
such
meanness
cried
paul
who
was
anxious
to
please
the
prince
for
reasons
of
his
own
well
as
i
see
you
are
a
good
ll
just
you
a
little
i
ll
tell
you
all
my
secrets
how
do
you
like
my
my
dear
boy
wonderful
uncle
wonderful
it
astonishes
me
that
you
should
have
been
able
to
keep
it
so
long
your
wonder
my
friend
it
s
no
that
s
difficult
to
believe
well
and
your
whiskers
uncle
black
them
now
you
black
them
i
don
t
black
them
but
they
too
are
said
the
prince
regarding
mosgliakoff
with
a
look
of
triumph
artificial
no
no
uncle
i
can
t
believe
you
re
laughing
at
me
d
honneur
mon
ami
cried
the
delighted
old
man
and
fancy
is
taken
in
by
them
just
as
you
were
even
stepanida
matveyevna
can
not
believe
they
are
not
real
sometimes
although
she
often
sticks
them
on
herself
but
i
am
sure
my
dear
friend
you
will
keep
my
give
me
your
word
i
do
give
you
my
word
uncle
but
surely
you
do
not
suppose
i
would
be
so
mean
as
to
divulge
it
oh
my
boy
i
had
such
a
fall
without
you
the
coachman
upset
me
out
of
the
carriage
again
how
when
why
we
were
driving
to
the
when
i
know
uncle
that
was
early
this
morning
no
no
a
couple
of
hours
ago
not
more
i
was
driving
along
with
him
and
he
suddenly
took
and
me
why
my
dear
uncle
you
were
asleep
began
paul
in
amazement
i
did
have
a
sleep
and
then
i
drove
away
at
least
least
me
how
strange
it
all
seems
i
assure
you
uncle
you
have
been
dreaming
you
saw
all
this
in
a
dream
you
have
been
sleeping
quietly
here
since
just
after
dinner
no
and
the
prince
reflected
perhaps
i
did
see
it
all
in
a
dream
however
i
can
remember
all
i
saw
quite
well
first
i
saw
a
large
bull
with
horns
and
then
i
saw
a
and
i
think
he
had
huge
horns
too
then
there
was
napoleon
buonaparte
did
you
ever
hear
my
boy
that
people
say
i
am
so
like
napoleon
buonaparte
but
my
profile
is
very
like
some
old
pope
what
do
you
think
about
it
my
i
think
you
are
much
more
like
napoleon
buonaparte
uncle
why
of
face
so
i
am
my
boy
so
i
am
i
dreamt
of
him
on
his
and
do
you
know
he
was
such
a
merry
fellow
he
quite
me
who
asked
mosgliakoff
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
old
man
a
strange
idea
was
beginning
to
occupy
his
idea
which
he
could
not
quite
put
into
shape
as
yet
we
talked
about
philosophical
subjects
and
do
you
know
my
boy
i
became
quite
sorry
that
the
english
had
been
so
hard
upon
him
of
course
though
if
one
didn
t
chain
him
up
he
would
be
flying
at
people
s
throats
again
still
i
m
sorry
for
him
now
i
should
have
managed
him
quite
differently
i
should
have
put
him
on
an
uninhabited
why
uninhabited
uncle
asked
mosgliakoff
absently
well
well
an
inhabited
one
then
but
the
must
be
good
sort
of
people
and
i
should
arrange
all
sorts
of
amusements
for
him
at
the
state
s
charge
theatres
balle
s
and
so
on
and
of
course
he
should
walk
about
under
proper
then
he
should
have
tarts
he
liked
tarts
you
know
as
many
tarts
as
ever
he
pleased
i
should
treat
him
like
a
and
he
would
end
by
being
sorry
for
his
sins
see
if
he
wouldn
t
mosgliakoff
listened
absently
to
all
this
senile
gabble
and
bit
his
nails
with
impatience
he
was
anxious
to
turn
the
conversation
on
to
the
subject
of
marriage
he
did
not
know
quite
clearly
why
he
wished
to
do
so
but
his
heart
was
boiling
over
with
anger
suddenly
the
old
man
made
an
exclamation
of
surprise
why
my
dear
boy
i
declare
i
ve
forgotten
to
tell
you
about
it
fancy
i
made
an
offer
of
marriage
an
offer
of
marriage
uncle
cried
paul
brightening
up
why
an
offer
pachomief
are
you
going
all
right
away
with
you
est
une
charmante
but
i
confess
i
took
the
step
rather
i
only
begin
to
see
that
now
dear
me
dear
dear
me
excuse
me
uncle
but
did
you
make
this
offer
well
i
admit
i
don
t
know
exactly
i
made
it
perhaps
i
it
i
don
t
know
dear
me
how
very
strange
it
all
seems
mosgliakoff
trembled
with
joy
his
new
idea
blazed
forth
in
full
developed
glory
and
did
you
propose
to
he
asked
impatiently
the
daughter
of
the
house
my
boy
that
girl
forget
what
they
call
her
my
dear
boy
you
see
can
t
possibly
marry
what
am
i
to
do
oh
of
course
you
are
done
for
if
you
marry
that
s
clear
but
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
uncle
are
you
perfectly
certain
that
you
actually
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
i
m
sure
of
it
and
what
if
you
dreamed
the
whole
thing
just
as
you
did
that
you
were
upset
out
of
the
carriage
a
second
time
dear
me
dear
me
really
think
i
may
have
dreamed
it
it
s
very
awkward
i
don
t
know
how
to
show
myself
there
now
could
i
find
out
dear
boy
for
certain
couldn
t
i
get
to
know
by
some
outside
way
whether
i
really
did
make
her
an
offer
of
or
not
why
just
you
think
of
my
dreadful
do
you
know
uncle
i
don
t
think
we
need
trouble
ourselves
to
find
out
at
why
then
i
am
convinced
that
you
were
think
so
myself
too
my
dear
fellow
as
i
often
have
that
sort
of
you
see
uncle
you
had
a
drop
of
wine
for
lunch
and
then
another
drop
or
two
for
dinner
don
t
you
know
and
so
you
may
easily
quite
so
quite
so
it
may
easily
have
been
besides
my
dear
uncle
however
excited
you
may
have
been
you
would
never
have
taken
such
a
senseless
step
in
your
waking
moments
so
far
as
i
know
you
uncle
you
are
a
man
of
the
highest
and
most
deliberate
judgment
and
i
am
positive
why
only
your
relations
were
to
get
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
my
goodness
uncle
they
were
cruel
enough
to
you
before
what
do
you
suppose
they
would
do
eh
goodness
gracious
cried
the
frightened
old
prince
gracious
what
would
they
do
do
you
think
do
why
of
course
they
would
all
screech
out
that
you
had
acted
under
the
influence
of
insanity
in
fact
that
you
were
mad
that
you
had
been
swindled
and
that
you
must
be
put
under
proper
restraint
in
fact
they
d
pop
you
into
some
lunatic
mosgliakoff
was
well
aware
of
the
best
method
of
frightening
the
poor
old
man
out
of
his
wits
gracious
heavens
cried
the
latter
trembling
like
a
leaflet
with
horror
heavens
would
they
really
do
that
undoubtedly
and
knowing
this
uncle
think
for
yourself
could
you
possibly
have
done
such
a
thing
with
your
eyes
open
as
if
you
don
t
understand
what
s
good
for
you
just
as
well
as
your
neighbours
i
solemnly
affirm
that
you
saw
all
this
in
a
dream
of
course
of
course
in
a
dream
so
what
a
clever
fellow
you
are
my
dear
boy
you
saw
it
at
once
i
am
deeply
to
you
for
putting
me
right
i
was
really
quite
under
the
i
had
actually
done
and
how
glad
i
am
that
i
met
you
uncle
before
you
went
in
there
just
fancy
what
a
mess
you
might
have
made
of
it
you
might
have
gone
in
thinking
you
were
engaged
to
the
girl
and
behaved
in
the
capacity
of
accepted
lover
think
how
fearfully
of
course
most
dangerous
why
remember
this
girl
is
years
old
nobody
will
marry
her
and
suddenly
a
rich
and
eminent
man
of
rank
and
title
appear
on
the
scene
as
her
accepted
swain
they
would
lay
hold
of
the
idea
at
once
and
act
up
to
it
and
swear
that
you
really
were
her
future
husband
and
would
marry
you
off
too
i
daresay
they
would
even
count
upon
your
speedy
death
and
make
their
calculations
no
then
again
uncle
a
man
of
your
quite
so
and
wisdom
quite
so
and
prince
into
the
bargain
good
gracious
uncle
as
if
a
man
like
yourself
would
make
such
a
match
as
if
you
really
did
mean
marrying
what
would
your
relations
say
why
my
dear
boy
they
d
simply
me
up
know
their
cunning
and
malice
of
old
my
dear
won
t
believe
i
assure
you
i
was
afraid
they
were
going
to
put
me
into
a
asylum
a
common
goodness
me
think
of
that
whatever
should
i
have
done
with
myself
all
day
in
a
of
course
of
course
well
i
won
t
leave

in
the
presence
of
everybody

at
seven
next
morning

must
say

t
you
fear

there
and
mind
whatever
they
say
or
hint
to
you
you
must
declare
that
you
dreamed
the
whole
indeed
you
did
of
course
quite
so
so
but
do
you
know
my
dear
boy
it
was
a
most
dream

lovely
girl

boy

well
uncle

how

the
old
man
greatly
alarmed
no
no
uncle
but
we
must
enter
the
room
separately
first
i
will
go
in
and
then
you
come
down
that

better
very
well
very
well
besides
i
just

little
capital
uncle

down
and
then

a
bewitching
dream
a
most
dream
chapter
xii
here
we
all
are
all
of
us
come
to
spend
the
evening
proskovia
ilinishna
is
coming
too
and
luisa
karlovna
and
all
cried
antipova
as
she
entered
the
salon
and
looked
hungrily
round
she
was
a
neat
pretty
little
woman
she
was
and
knew
it
she
looked
greedily
around
as
i
say
because
she
had
an
idea
that
the
prince
and
zina
were
hidden
together
somewhere
about
the
room
yes
and
katerina
petrovna
and
felisata
michaelovna
are
coming
as
well
added
natalia
dimitrievna
a
huge
figure
had
pleased
the
prince
so
much
and
who
looked
more
like
a
grenadier
than
anything
else
this
monster
had
been
hand
and
glove
with
little
antipova
for
the
last
three
weeks
they
were
now
quite
inseparable
natalia
looked
as
though
she
could
pick
her
little
friend
up
and
swallow
her
bones
and
all
without
thinking
i
need
not
say
with
what
i
welcome
you
both
to
my
house
and
for
a
whole
evening
too
piped
maria
alexandrovna
a
little
recovered
from
her
first
shock
of
amazement
but
do
tell
me
what
miracle
is
it
that
has
brought
you
all
when
i
had
quite
despaired
of
ever
seeing
anyone
of
you
in
my
house
again
oh
oh
my
maria
alexandrovna
said
natalia
very
affectedly
but
sweetly
the
attributes
of
sweetness
and
affectation
were
a
curious
contrast
to
her
personal
appearance
you
see
dearest
maria
alexandrovna
chirped
antipova
we
really
must
get
on
with
the
private
theatricals
question
it
was
only
this
very
day
that
peter
michaelovitch
was
saying
how
it
was
of
us
to
have
made
no
progress
towards
rehearsing
and
so
on
and
that
it
was
quite
time
we
brought
all
our
silly
squabbles
to
an
end
well
four
of
us
got
together
and
then
it
struck
us
let
s
all
go
to
maria
alexandrovna
s
and
settle
the
matter
once
for
all
so
natalia
dimitrievna
let
all
the
rest
know
that
we
were
to
meet
here
we
ll
soon
settle
don
t
think
we
should
allow
it
to
be
said
that
we
do
nothing
but
squabble
over
the
preliminaries
and
get
no
farther
do
dear
maria
alexandrovna
she
added
playfully
and
kissing
our
heroine
affectionately
goodness
me
zenaida
i
declare
you
grow
prettier
every
day
and
she
betook
herself
to
embracing
zina
with
equal
affection
she
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
sit
and
grow
more
and
more
beautiful
said
natalia
with
great
sweetness
rubbing
her
huge
hands
together
oh
the
devil
take
them
all
they
know
i
care
nothing
about
private
magpies
reflected
maria
alexandrovna
beside
herself
with
rage
especially
dear
as
that
delightful
prince
is
with
you
just
now
you
know
there
is
a
private
theatre
in
his
house
at
donchanof
and
we
have
discovered
that
somewhere
or
other
there
there
are
a
lot
of
old
theatrical
properties
and
decorations
and
scenery
the
prince
was
at
my
house
but
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
him
that
it
all
went
clean
out
of
my
head
and
i
forgot
to
ask
him
now
we
ll
broach
the
subject
before
him
you
must
support
me
and
we
ll
persuade
him
to
send
us
all
the
old
rubbish
that
can
be
found
we
want
to
get
the
prince
to
come
and
see
the
play
too
he
is
sure
to
subscribe
isn
t
it
is
for
the
poor
perhaps
he
would
even
take
a
part
he
is
such
a
dear
kind
willing
old
man
if
only
he
did
it
would
make
the
fortune
of
our
play
of
course
he
will
take
a
part
why
he
can
be
made
to
play
part
remarked
natalia
significantly
antipova
had
not
exaggerated
guests
poured
in
every
moment
maria
alexandrovna
hardly
had
time
to
receive
one
lot
and
make
the
usual
exclamations
of
surprise
and
delight
exacted
by
the
laws
of
etiquette
before
another
arrival
would
be
announced
i
will
not
undertake
to
describe
all
these
good
people
i
will
only
remark
that
every
one
of
them
on
arrival
looked
about
her
cunningly
and
that
every
face
wore
an
expression
of
expectation
and
impatience
some
of
them
came
with
the
distinct
intention
of
witnessing
some
scene
of
a
delightfully
scandalous
nature
and
were
prepared
to
be
very
angry
indeed
if
it
should
turn
out
that
they
were
obliged
to
leave
the
house
without
the
gratification
of
their
hopes
all
behaved
in
the
most
amiable
and
affectionate
manner
towards
their
hostess
but
maria
alexandrovna
firmly
braced
her
nerves
for
battle
many
apparently
natural
and
innocent
questions
were
asked
about
the
prince
but
in
each
one
might
be
detected
some
hint
or
insinuation
tea
came
in
and
people
moved
about
and
changed
places
one
group
surrounded
the
piano
zina
was
requested
to
play
and
sing
but
answered
drily
that
she
was
not
quite
the
paleness
of
her
face
bore
out
this
assertion
inquiries
were
made
for
mosgliakoff
and
these
inquiries
were
addressed
to
zina
maria
alexandrovna
proved
that
she
had
the
eyes
and
ears
of
ten
ordinary
mortals
she
saw
and
heard
all
that
was
going
on
in
every
corner
of
the
room
she
heard
and
answered
every
question
asked
and
answered
readily
and
cleverly
she
was
dreadfully
anxious
about
zina
however
and
wondered
why
she
did
not
leave
the
room
as
she
usually
did
on
such
occasions
poor
afanassy
came
in
for
his
share
of
notice
too
it
was
the
custom
of
these
amiable
people
of
mordasoff
to
do
their
best
to
set
maria
alexandrovna
and
her
husband
by
the
ears
but
there
were
hopes
of
extracting
valuable
news
and
secrets
out
of
the
candid
simplicity
of
the
latter
maria
alexandrovna
watched
the
state
of
siege
into
which
the
wretched
afanassy
was
thrown
with
great
anxiety
he
was
answering
h
m
to
all
questions
put
to
him
as
instructed
but
with
so
wretched
an
expression
and
so
extremely
artificial
a
mien
that
maria
alexandrovna
could
barely
restrain
her
wrath
maria
alexandrovna
your
husband
won
t
have
a
word
to
say
to
me
remarked
a
little
lady
with
a
manner
as
though
she
cared
nothing
for
anybody
and
was
not
to
be
abashed
under
any
circumstances
do
ask
him
to
be
a
more
courteous
towards
ladies
i
really
don
t
know
myself
what
can
have
happened
to
him
said
maria
alexandrovna
interrupting
her
conversation
with
antipova
and
natalia
and
laughing
merrily
he
is
so
uncommunicative
he
has
scarcely
said
a
word
even
to
all
day
why
don
t
you
answer
felisata
michaelovna
afanassy
what
did
you
ask
him
but
mammy
you
told
me
yourself
the
bewildered
and
lost
afanassy
at
this
moment
he
was
standing
at
the
fireside
with
one
hand
placed
inside
his
waistcoat
in
an
artistic
position
which
he
had
chosen
deliberately
on
mature
reflection
he
was
sipping
his
tea
the
questions
of
the
ladies
had
so
confused
him
that
he
was
blushing
like
a
girl
when
he
began
the
justification
of
himself
recorded
above
he
suddenly
met
so
dreadful
a
look
in
the
eyes
of
his
infuriated
spouse
that
he
nearly
lost
all
consciousness
for
terror
uncertain
what
to
do
but
anxious
to
recover
himself
and
win
back
her
favour
once
more
he
said
nothing
but
took
a
gulp
of
tea
to
restore
his
scattered
senses
unfortunately
the
tea
was
too
hot
which
fact
together
with
the
hugeness
of
the
gulp
he
upset
him
he
burned
his
throat
choked
sent
the
cup
flying
and
burst
into
such
a
fit
of
coughing
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
the
room
for
a
time
awakening
universal
astonishment
by
his
conduct
in
a
word
maria
alexandrovna
saw
clearly
enough
that
her
guests
knew
all
about
it
and
had
assembled
with
malicious
intent
the
situation
was
dangerous
they
were
quite
capable
of
confusing
and
overwhelming
the
old
prince
before
her
very
eyes
they
might
even
carry
him
off
stirring
up
a
quarrel
between
the
old
man
and
herself
might
happen
but
fate
had
prepared
her
one
more
surprise
the
door
opened
and
in
came
as
she
thought
was
far
enough
away
at
his
godfather
s
and
would
not
come
near
her
she
shuddered
as
though
something
had
hurt
her
mosgliakoff
stood
a
moment
at
the
door
looking
around
at
the
company
he
was
a
little
bewildered
and
could
not
conceal
his
agitation
which
showed
itself
very
clearly
in
his
expression
why
it
s
paul
alexandrovitch
and
you
told
us
he
had
gone
to
his
godfather
s
maria
alexandrovna
we
were
told
you
had
hidden
yourself
away
from
us
paul
alexandrovitch
cried
natalia
hidden
myself
said
paul
with
a
crooked
sort
of
a
smile
what
a
strange
expression
excuse
me
natalia
dimitrievna
but
i
never
hide
from
anyone
i
have
no
cause
to
do
so
that
i
know
of
nor
do
i
ever
hide
anyone
else
he
added
looking
significantly
at
maria
alexandrovna
maria
alexandrovna
trembled
in
her
shoes
surely
this
fool
of
a
man
is
not
up
to
anything
disagreeable
she
thought
no
no
that
would
be
worse
than
anything
she
looked
curiously
and
anxiously
into
his
eyes
is
it
true
paul
alexandrovitch
that
you
have
just
been
politely
dismissed
government
service
i
mean
of
course
remarked
the
daring
felisata
michaelovna
looking
impertinently
into
his
eyes
dismissed
how
dismissed
i
m
simply
changing
my
department
that
s
all
i
am
to
be
placed
at
petersburg
mosgliakoff
answered
drily
oh
well
i
congratulate
you
continued
the
bold
young
woman
we
were
alarmed
to
hear
that
you
were
trying
for
place
down
here
at
mordasoff
the
berths
here
are
wretched
paul
good
at
all
i
assure
you
i
don
t
s
a
place
as
teacher
at
the
school
vacant
i
believe
remarked
natalia
this
was
such
a
crude
and
palpable
insinuation
that
even
antipova
was
ashamed
of
her
friend
and
kicked
her
under
the
table
you
don
t
suppose
paul
alexandrovitch
would
accept
the
place
vacated
by
a
wretched
little
schoolmaster
said
felisata
michaelovna
but
paul
did
not
answer
he
turned
at
this
moment
and
encountered
afanassy
matveyevitch
just
returning
into
the
room
the
latter
offered
him
his
hand
mosgliakoff
like
a
fool
looked
beyond
poor
afanassy
and
did
not
take
his
outstretched
hand
annoyed
to
the
limits
of
endurance
he
stepped
up
to
zina
and
muttered
gazing
angrily
into
her
eyes
this
is
all
thanks
to
you
wait
a
bit
you
shall
see
this
very
day
whether
i
am
a
fool
or
not
why
put
off
the
revelation
it
is
clear
enough
already
said
zina
aloud
staring
contemptuously
at
her
former
lover
mosgliakoff
hurriedly
left
her
he
did
not
half
like
the
loud
tone
she
spoke
in
have
you
been
to
your
godfather
s
asked
maria
alexandrovna
at
last
determined
to
sound
matters
in
this
direction
no
i
ve
just
been
with
with
your
uncle
what
have
you
just
come
from
the
prince
now
and
we
were
told
the
prince
was
asleep
added
natalia
dimitrievna
looking
daggers
at
maria
alexandrovna
do
not
be
disturbed
about
the
prince
natalia
dimitrievna
replied
paul
he
is
awake
now
and
quite
restored
to
his
senses
he
was
persuaded
to
drink
a
good
deal
too
much
wine
first
at
your
house
and
then
here
so
that
he
quite
lost
his
head
which
never
was
too
strong
however
i
have
had
a
talk
with
him
and
he
now
seems
to
have
entirely
recovered
his
judgment
thank
god
he
is
coming
down
directly
to
take
his
leave
maria
alexandrovna
and
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kind
hospitality
and
morning
early
we
are
off
to
the
hermitage
thence
i
shall
myself
see
him
safe
home
to
donchanovo
in
order
that
he
may
be
far
from
the
temptation
to
further
excesses
like
that
of
there
i
shall
give
him
over
into
the
hands
of
stepanida
matveyevna
who
must
be
back
at
home
by
this
time
and
who
will
assuredly
never
allow
him
another
opportunity
of
going
on
his
travels
i
ll
answer
for
that
so
saying
mosgliakoff
stared
angrily
at
maria
alexandrovna
the
latter
sat
still
apparently
dumb
with
amazement
i
regret
to
gives
me
great
pain
to
record
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
my
heroine
was
decidedly
alarmed
so
the
prince
is
off
morning
dear
me
why
is
that
inquired
natalia
dimitrievna
very
sweetly
of
maria
alexandrovna
yes
how
is
that
asked
antipova
in
astonishment
yes
dear
me
how
comes
that
i
wonder
said
two
or
three
voices
how
can
that
be
when
we
were
me
how
very
strange
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
could
not
find
words
to
reply
in
however
at
this
moment
the
general
attention
was
distracted
by
a
most
unwonted
and
eccentric
episode
in
the
next
room
was
heard
a
strange
exclamations
and
hurrying
feet
which
was
followed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
sophia
petrovna
the
fidgety
guest
who
had
called
upon
maria
alexandrovna
in
the
morning
sophia
petrovna
was
a
very
eccentric
woman
much
so
that
even
the
good
people
of
mordasoff
could
not
support
her
and
had
lately
voted
her
out
of
society
i
must
observe
that
every
evening
punctually
at
seven
this
lady
was
in
the
habit
of
having
what
she
called
a
snack
and
that
after
this
snack
which
she
declared
was
for
the
benefit
of
her
liver
her
condition
was
well
to
use
no
stronger
term
she
was
in
this
very
condition
as
described
now
as
she
appeared
flinging
herself
into
maria
alexandrovna
s
salon
oho
so
this
is
how
you
treat
me
maria
alexandrovna
she
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
voice

t
be
afraid

shall
not
inflict
myself
upon
you
for
more
than
a
minute
i

i
just
came
in
to
see
if
what
they
said
was
true
ah

in
for

and
receptions
and
parties
and
sophia
petrovna

dimitrievna
having
got
hold
of
the
prince
and
now
this
very
natalia
dimitrievna

like

pickpocket
and
who

just

polite

she
spoke
of

among
your
guests

maria
alexandrovna

cried
sophia
petrovna
in
her
shrill
squeaky
voice
from
among
the
crowd
of
guests
who
now
surrounded
her
and
who
seemed
to
derive
immense
satisfaction
from
this
unexpected
scene

about
it
i
assure
you
your
friend
nastasia

over
and

and

him
to

an
offer
of

maria

beside
herself
with
rage

not
indulge
in
this
sort
of
sally
at
respectable
houses
especially

and

me
tell

that

and

obliged
to

for
the
prince
s
benefit
what
may
be
laughing
at
antipova
i
suppose

broken
his
leg

just
been
taken
home
tfu
maria
luck
to

tfu
sophia
petrovna
now
disappeared
all
the
guests
laughed
maria
alexandrovna
was
in
a
state
of
indescribable
fury
i
think
the
good
lady
must
have
been
drinking
said
natalia
dimitrievna
sweetly
but
what
audacity
abominable
femme
what
a
raving
lunatic
but
really
what
excessively
improper
things
she
says
yes
but
what
she
have
meant
by
a
betrothal
party
what
sort
of
a
betrothal
party
is
this
asked
felisata
michaelovna
innocently
it
is
too
bad
maria
alexandrovna
burst
out
at
last
it
is
just
such
abominable
women
as
this
that
sow
nonsensical
rumours
about
it
is
not
the
fact
that
there
such
women
about
felisata
michaelovna
that
is
so
surprising
the
astonishing
part
of
the
matter
is
that
ladies
can
be
found
who
support
and
encourage
them
and
believe
their
abominable
tales
the
prince
the
prince
cried
all
the
guests
at
once
oh
oh
here
he
dear
dear
prince
well
thank
goodness
we
shall
hear
all
the
particulars
now
murmured
felisata
michaelovna
to
her
neighbour
chapter
xiii
the
prince
entered
and
smiled
benignly
around
all
the
agitation
which
his
conversation
with
mosgliakoff
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
had
aroused
in
his
vanished
at
the
sight
of
the
ladies
those
gentle
creatures
received
him
with
chirps
and
exclamations
of
joy
ladies
always
petted
our
old
friend
the
prince
and
a
familiar
with
him
he
had
a
way
of
amusing
them
with
his
own
individuality
which
was
astonishing
only
this
morning
felisata
michaelovna
had
announced
that
she
would
sit
on
his
knee
with
the
greatest
pleasure
if
he
liked
because
he
was
such
a
dear
old
pet
of
an
old
man
maria
alexandrovna
fastened
her
eyes
on
him
to
she
it
were
but
the
slightest
indication
of
his
state
of
mind
and
to
get
a
possible
idea
for
a
way
out
of
this
horribly
critical
position
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
made
of
face
it
was
just
as
as
ever
it
was
here
s
the
prince
at
last
cried
several
voices
oh
prince
how
we
have
waited
and
waited
for
you
with
impatience
prince
with
impatience
another
chorus
took
up
the
strain
dear
me
how
very
said
the
old
man
settling
himself
near
the
the
ladies
immediately
surrounded
him
there
only
remained
natalia
dimitrievna
and
antipova
with
the
hostess
afanassy
stood
and
smiled
with
great
courtesy
mosgliakoff
also
smiled
as
he
gazed
defiantly
at
zina
who
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
him
took
a
chair
near
her
father
and
sat
down
at
the
fireside
prince
do
tell
it
true
that
you
are
about
to
leave
us
so
soon
asked
felisata
michaelovna
yes
yes
i
am
going
abroad
almost
abroad
prince
abroad
why
what
can
have
caused
you
to
take
such
a
step
as
that
cried
several
ladies
at
once
abroad
said
the
prince
and
do
you
know
it
is
principally
for
the
sake
of
the
new
how
new
ideas
what
new
does
he
mean
the
astonished
ladies
asked
of
one
another
quite
ideas
repeated
the
prince
with
an
air
of
deep
conviction
everybody
goes
abroad
now
for
new
ideas
and
i
m
going
too
to
see
if
i
can
pick
any
up
to
this
moment
maria
alexandrovna
had
listened
to
the
conversation
observantly
but
it
now
struck
her
that
the
prince
had
entirely
forgotten
her
would
not
do
allow
me
prince
to
introduce
my
husband
afanassy
matveyevitch
he
hastened
up
from
our
country
seat
so
soon
as
ever
he
heard
of
your
arrival
in
our
afanassy
under
the
impression
that
he
was
being
praised
smiled
amiably
and
beamed
all
over
very
happy
very
said
the
prince
wait
a
moment
your
name
reminds
me
of
something
afanassy
you
are
the
man
down
at
the
village
charming
very
glad
i
m
sure

you
remember
my
boy
to
paul
the
nice
little
rhyme
we
fitted
out
to
him
what
was
it
oh

said
felisata
when

s
it
charming

so

that
man
dear

i
m

said
the
prince
stretching
out
his
hand
but
not
rising
from
his
chair
dear
me
and
how
is
your
health
my
dear
sir
h
m
oh
he
s
quite
well
thank

answered
maria
alexandrovna
quickly
i
see
he
looks
it
and
are
you
still
at
the
dear
me
very
pleased
i
m
sure
why
how
red
he
looks
and
he
s
always
afanassy
smiled
and
bowed
and
even
scraped
as
the
prince
spoke
but
at
the
last
observation
he
suddenly
and
without
warning
or
apparent
reason
burst
into
loud
fits
of
laughter
the
ladies
were
delighted
zina
flushed
up
and
with
flashing
eyes
darted
a
look
at
her
mother
who
in
her
turn
was
boiling
over
with
rage
it
was
time
to
change
the
conversation
did
you
have
a
nice
nap
prince
she
inquired
in
honied
accents
but
at
the
same
time
giving
afanassy
to
understand
with
very
looks
that
he
might
anywhere
oh
i
slept
wonderfully
and
do
you
know
i
had
such
a
most
fascinating
dream
a
dream
how
delightful
i
do
so
love
to
hear
people
tell
their
dreams
cried
felisata
oh
a
dream
stammered
the
old
man
again
quite
but
all
the
more
a
dead
secret
for
that
very
oh
prince
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
can
t
tell
us
said
antipova
i
suppose
it
s
an
dream
isn
t
it
a
dead
secret
repeated
the
prince
purposely
whetting
the
curiosity
of
the
ladies
and
enjoying
the
fun
then
it
be
interesting
oh
interesting
cried
other
ladies
i
don
t
mind
taking
a
bet
that
the
prince
dreamed
that
he
was
kneeling
at
some
lovely
woman
s
feet
and
making
a
declaration
of
love
said
felisata
michaelovna
confess
now
prince
that
it
was
so
confess
dear
prince
yes
prince
confess
the
chorus
took
up
the
cry
the
old
man
listened
solemnly
until
the
last
voice
was
hushed
the
ladies
guesswork
flattered
his
vanity
wonderfully
he
was
as
pleased
as
he
could
be
though
i
did
say
that
my
dream
was
a
dead
he
replied
at
last
still
i
am
obliged
to
confess
dear
lady
that
to
my
great
you
have
almost
exactly
guessed
i
ve
guessed
it
i
ve
guessed
it
cried
felisata
in
a
rapture
of
joy
well
prince
say
what
you
like
but
it
s
your
duty
to
tell
us
the
name
of
your
beauty
come
now
it
of
course
of
course
is
she
in
this
town
dear
prince
tell
prince
do
tell
us
you
positively
was
heard
on
all
sides
if
you
must
know
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
the
most
charming
and
and
lady
i
know
said
the
prince
unctuously
the
most
bewitching
and
belonging
to
this
place
who
it
be
cried
the
ladies
interchanging
looks
and
signs
why
of
course
the
young
lady
who
is
considered
the
reigning
beauty
here
remarked
natalia
dimitrievna
rubbing
her
hands
and
looking
hard
at
zina
with
those
cat
of
hers
all
joined
her
in
staring
at
zina
but
prince
if
you
dream
those
sort
of
things
why
should
not
you
marry
somebody
asked
felisata
looking
around
her
with
a
significant
expression
we
would
marry
you
off
beautifully
prince
said
somebody
else
oh
dear
prince
marry
chirped
another
marry
marry
marry
was
now
the
cry
on
all
sides
why
should
i
not
said
the
old
man
confused
and
bewildered
with
all
the
cries
and
exclamations
around
him
uncle
cried
mosgliakoff
my
boy
quite
so
i
what
you
mean
i
may
as
well
tell
you
ladies
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
marry
again
and
having
passed
one
most
delightful
evening
with
our
fascinating
hostess
i
must
start
away
to
the
hermitage
and
then
i
shall
go
straight
off
abroad
and
study
the
question
of
the
enlightenment
of
zina
shuddered
and
looked
over
at
her
mother
with
an
expression
of
unspeakable
anguish
but
maria
alexandrovna
had
now
made
up
her
mind
how
to
act
all
this
while
she
had
played
a
mere
waiting
game
observing
closely
and
carefully
all
that
was
said
or
done
although
she
could
see
only
too
clearly
that
her
plans
were
undermined
and
that
her
foes
had
come
about
her
in
numbers
which
were
too
great
to
be
altogether
pleasant
at
last
however
she
comprehended
the
situation
she
thought
completely
she
had
gauged
how
the
matter
stood
in
all
its
branches
and
she
determined
to
slay
the
hydra
at
one
fell
blow
with
great
majesty
then
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
approached
the
stalking
across
the
room
with
firm
and
dignified
tread
as
she
looked
around
upon
her
pigmy
foes
the
fire
of
inspiration
blazed
in
her
eyes
she
resolved
to
smite
once
and
annihilate
this
vile
nest
of
poisonous
to
destroy
the
miserable
mosgliakoff
as
though
he
were
a
blackbeetle
and
with
one
triumphant
blow
to
reassert
all
her
influence
over
this
miserable
old
some
audacity
was
requisite
for
such
a
performance
of
course
but
maria
alexandrovna
had
not
even
to
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
for
a
supply
of
that
particular
commodity
she
began
solemnly
and
with
much
dignity
maria
alexandrovna
was
always
a
great
admirer
of
solemnity
i
have
been
a
listener
to
your
your
witty
remarks
and
merry
enough
and
i
consider
that
my
turn
has
come
at
last
to
put
in
a
word
in
contribution
you
are
aware
we
have
all
met
here
accidentally
to
my
great
joy
i
must
my
very
great
joy
but
though
i
should
be
the
first
to
refuse
to
divulge
a
family
secret
before
the
strictest
rules
of
ordinary
propriety
rendered
such
a
revelation
necessary
yet
as
my
dear
guest
here
appears
to
me
to
have
given
us
to
understand
by
covert
hints
and
insinuations
that
he
is
not
averse
to
the
matter
becoming
common
property
he
will
forgive
me
if
i
have
mistaken
his
intentions
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
prince
is
not
only
not
averse
but
actually
desires
me
to
make
known
our
great
family
secret
am
i
right
prince
quite
so
quite
so
very
glad
glad
i
m
sure
said
the
prince
who
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
the
good
lady
was
talking
about
maria
alexandrovna
for
greater
effect
now
paused
to
take
breath
and
looked
solemnly
and
proudly
around
upon
the
assembled
guests
all
of
whom
were
now
listening
with
greedy
but
slightly
disturbed
curiosity
to
what
their
hostess
was
about
to
reveal
to
them
mosgliakoff
shuddered
zina
flushed
up
and
arose
from
her
seat
afanassy
seeing
that
something
important
was
about
to
happen
blew
his
nose
violently
in
order
to
be
ready
for
any
emergency
yes
ladies
i
am
entrust
my
family
secret
to
your
keeping
evening
the
prince
overcome
by
the
beauty
and
virtues
of
my
daughter
has
done
her
the
honour
of
proposing
to
me
for
her
hand
prince
she
concluded
in
trembling
tearful
accents
dear
prince
you
must
not
you
can
not
blame
me
for
my
candour
it
is
only
my
overwhelming
joy
that
could
have
torn
this
dear
secret
prematurely
from
my
heart
and
what
mother
is
there
who
will
blame
me
in
such
a
case
as
this
words
fail
me
to
describe
the
effect
produced
by
this
most
unexpected
sally
on
the
part
of
maria
alexandrovna
all
present
appeared
to
be
struck
dumb
with
amazement
these
perfidious
guests
who
had
thought
to
frighten
maria
alexandrovna
by
showing
her
that
they
knew
her
secret
who
thought
to
annihilate
her
by
the
premature
revelation
of
that
secret
who
thought
to
overwhelm
her
for
the
present
with
their
hints
and
insinuations
these
guests
were
themselves
struck
down
and
pulverized
by
this
fearless
candour
on
her
part
such
audacious
frankness
argued
the
consciousness
of
strength
so
that
the
prince
actually
and
of
his
own
is
really
going
to
marry
zina
so
they
did
not
drink
and
bully
and
swindle
him
into
it
so
he
is
not
to
be
married
burglariously
and
forcibly
so
maria
alexandrovna
is
not
afraid
of
anybody
then
we
can
t
knock
this
marriage
on
the
the
prince
is
not
being
married
compulsorily
such
were
the
questions
and
exclamations
the
visitors
now
put
to
themselves
and
each
other
but
very
soon
the
whispers
which
the
hostess
s
words
had
awakened
all
over
the
room
suddenly
changed
to
chirps
and
exclamations
of
joy
natalia
dimitrievna
was
the
first
to
come
forward
and
embrace
maria
alexandrovna
then
came
antipova
next
felisata
michaelovna
all
present
were
shortly
on
their
feet
and
moving
about
changing
places
many
of
the
ladies
were
pale
with
rage
some
began
to
congratulate
zina
who
was
confused
enough
without
some
attached
themselves
to
the
wretched
afanassy
matveyevitch
maria
alexandrovna
stretched
her
arms
theatrically
and
embraced
her
by
force
the
prince
alone
gazed
upon
the
company
with
a
sort
of
confused
wonder
but
he
smiled
on
as
before
he
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
the
scene
at
sight
of
the
mother
and
daughter
embracing
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
eye
in
the
corner
of
which
there
really
was
a
tear
of
course
the
company
fell
upon
him
with
their
congratulations
before
very
long
i
congratulate
you
prince
i
congratulate
you
came
from
all
sides
at
once
so
you
going
to
be
married
prince
so
you
going
to
marry
dear
prince
you
really
are
to
be
married
then
quite
so
quite
so
replied
the
old
fellow
delighted
beyond
measure
with
all
the
rapture
and
atmosphere
of
congratulation
around
him
and
i
confess
what
i
like
best
of
all
is
the
kind
you
all
take
in
me
i
shall
never
forget
it
never
it
charming
charming
you
have
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
kiss
me
prince
cried
felisata
michaelovna
in
stentorian
tones
and
i
further
continued
the
prince
as
well
as
the
constant
physical
interruptions
from
all
sides
allowed
him
i
confess
i
am
beyond
measure
that
maria
alexandrovna
our
revered
hostess
should
have
had
the
extraordinary
to
guess
my
dream
she
might
have
dreamed
it
herself
instead
of
me
perspicacity
wonderful
oh
prince
your
dream
again
oh
come
prince
cried
one
and
all
yes
prince
it
is
no
use
concealing
it
now
it
is
time
we
divulged
this
secret
of
ours
said
maria
alexandrovna
severely
and
decidedly
i
quite
entered
into
your
refined
allegorical
manner
the
delightful
delicacy
with
which
you
gave
me
to
understand
by
means
of
subtle
insinuations
that
you
wished
the
fact
of
your
engagement
to
be
made
known
yes
ladies
it
is
all
true
this
very
evening
the
prince
knelt
at
my
daughter
s
feet
and
actually
and
by
no
means
in
a
dream
made
a
solemn
proposal
of
marriage
to
her
quite
so
just
exactly
like
that
and
under
the
very
she
describes
just
like
said
the
old
man
my
dear
young
lady
he
continued
bowing
with
his
greatest
courtesy
to
zina
who
had
by
no
means
recovered
from
her
amazement
as
yet
my
dear
young
lady
i
swear
to
you
i
should
never
have
dared
thus
to
bring
your
name
into
if
others
had
not
done
so
before
me
it
was
a
most
dream
a
dream
and
i
am
doubly
happy
that
i
have
been
to
describe
it
dear
me
how
very
curious
it
is
he
insists
on
sticking
to
his
idea
about
a
dream
whispered
antipova
to
the
now
slightly
paling
maria
alexandrovna
alas
that
great
woman
had
felt
her
heart
beating
more
quickly
than
she
liked
without
this
last
little
reminder
what
does
it
mean
whispered
the
ladies
among
themselves
excuse
me
prince
began
maria
alexandrovna
with
a
miserable
attempt
at
a
smile
but
i
confess
you
astonish
me
a
great
deal
what
is
this
strange
idea
of
yours
about
a
dream
i
confess
i
had
thought
you
were
joking
up
to
this
moment
it
be
a
joke
on
your
part
it
is
exceedingly
out
of
place
i
should
am
to
ascribe
your
conduct
to
absence
of
mind
yes
it
may
really
be
a
case
of
absence
of
mind
put
in
natalia
dimitrievna
in
a
whisper
course
quite
so
it
may
easily
be
absence
of
mind
confirmed
the
prince
who
clearly
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
what
they
were
trying
to
get
out
of
him
and
with
regard
to
this
subject
let
me
tell
you
a
little
i
was
asked
to
a
funeral
at
petersburg
and
i
went
and
made
a
little
about
it
and
thought
it
was
a
birthday
so
i
brought
a
lovely
bouquet
of
when
i
came
in
and
saw
the
master
of
the
house
lying
in
state
on
a
table
i
didn
t
know
where
to
or
what
to
do
with
my
i
assure
you
yes
but
prince
this
is
not
the
moment
for
stories
observed
maria
alexandrovna
with
great
annoyance
of
course
my
daughter
has
no
need
to
beat
up
a
husband
but
at
the
same
time
i
must
repeat
that
you
yourself
here
just
by
the
piano
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
did
not
ask
you
to
do
it
i
may
say
i
was
amazed
to
hear
it
however
since
the
episode
of
your
proposal
i
may
say
that
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
and
i
have
only
waited
for
your
appearance
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
you
but
i
am
a
mother
and
this
is
my
daughter
you
speak
of
a
dream
i
supposed
naturally
that
you
were
anxious
to
make
your
engagement
known
by
the
medium
of
an
allegory
well
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
that
someone
may
have
thought
fit
to
confuse
your
mind
on
this
matter
in
fact
i
may
say
that
i
have
my
suspicions
as
to
the
individual
responsible
for
such
kindly
explain
yourself
prince
explain
yourself
quickly
and
satisfactorily
you
can
not
be
permitted
to
jest
in
this
fashion
in
a
respectable
so
quite
so
one
should
not
jest
in
respectable
houses
remarked
the
prince
still
bewildered
but
beginning
gradually
to
grow
a
little
disconcerted
but
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
prince
i
ask
you
to
reply
categorically
i
insist
upon
your
here
and
at
fact
that
this
very
evening
you
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
to
my
daughter
quite
so
i
am
ready
to
confirm
that
but
i
have
told
the
all
about
it
and
felisata
michaelovna
guessed
my
dream
dream
it
was
a
dream
shouted
maria
alexandrovna
furiously
it
was
not
a
dream
prince
but
you
were
wide
awake
do
you
hear
were
awake
cried
the
prince
rising
from
his
chair
in
astonishment
well
there
you
are
my
friend
it
has
come
about
just
as
you
said
he
added
turning
to
mosgliakoff
but
i
assure
you
most
maria
alexandrovna
that
you
are
under
a
i
am
quite
convinced
that
i
saw
the
whole
scene
in
a
dream
goodness
gracious
cried
maria
alexandrovna
do
not
disturb
yourself
dear
maria
alexandrovna
said
natalia
dimitrievna
probably
the
prince
has
forgotten
he
will
recollect
himself
by
and
i
am
astonished
at
you
natalia
dimitrievna
said
the
now
furious
hostess
as
if
people
forget
this
sort
of
thing
excuse
me
prince
but
are
you
laughing
at
us
or
what
are
you
doing
are
you
trying
to
act
one
of
dumas
heroes
or
lauzun
or
ferlacourt
or
somebody
but
if
you
will
excuse
me
saying
so
you
are
a
good
deal
too
old
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
assure
you
your
amiable
little
will
not
do
here
my
daughter
is
not
a
french
viscountess
i
tell
you
this
very
evening
and
in
this
very
spot
here
my
daughter
sang
a
ballad
to
you
and
you
amazed
at
the
beauty
of
her
singing
went
down
on
your
knees
and
made
her
a
proposal
of
marriage
i
am
not
talking
in
my
sleep
am
i
surely
i
am
wide
awake
speak
prince
am
i
asleep
or
not
of
course
of
so
i
don
t
know
said
the
bewildered
old
man
i
mean
i
don
t
think
i
am
now
but
a
little
while
ago
i
asleep
you
see
and
while
asleep
i
had
this
dream
that
goodness
me
prince
i
tell
you
you
were
dreaming
do
you
hear
dreaming
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
are
you
raving
prince
or
what
deuce
only
knows
i
don
t
know
it
seems
to
me
i
m
getting
said
the
prince
looking
around
him
in
a
state
of
considerable
mental
perturbation
but
my
dear
prince
how
can
you
possibly
have
this
when
i
can
tell
you
all
the
minutest
details
of
your
proposal
and
of
the
circumstances
attending
it
you
have
not
told
any
of
us
of
these
details
how
could
i
possibly
have
known
what
you
dreamed
but
perhaps
the
prince
tell
someone
of
his
dream
in
detail
remarked
natalia
dimitrievna
quite
so
perhaps
i
did
tell
someone
all
about
my
dream
in
detail
said
the
now
completely
lost
and
bewildered
prince
here
s
a
nice
comedy
whispered
felisata
michaelovna
to
her
neighbour
my
goodness
me
this
is
too
much
for
patience
cried
maria
alexandrovna
beside
herself
with
helpless
rage
do
you
hear
me
prince
she
sang
you
a
you
a
surely
you
didn
t
dream
that
too
quite
so
it
really
did
seem
to
me
that
she
sang
me
a
ballad
murmured
the
prince
and
a
ray
of
recollection
seemed
to
flash
across
his
face
my
friend
he
continued
addressing
mosgliakoff
i
believe
i
forgot
to
tell
you
there
was
a
ballad
ballad
all
about
castles
and
knights
and
some
or
other
came
in
of
course
of
course
i
remember
it
all
quite
well
i
i
did
turn
over
the
ballad
it
puzzles
me
much
for
now
it
seems
as
though
i
had
really
heard
the
ballad
and
not
dreamt
it
i
confess
uncle
said
mosgliakoff
as
calmly
as
he
could
though
his
voice
shook
with
agitation
i
confess
i
do
not
see
any
difficulty
in
bringing
your
actual
experience
and
your
dream
into
strict
conformity
it
is
consistent
enough
you
probably
hear
the
ballad
miss
zenaida
sings
beautifully
probably
you
all
adjourned
into
this
room
and
zenaida
afanassievna
sang
you
the
song
of
course
i
was
not
there
myself
but
in
all
probability
this
ballad
reminded
you
of
old
times
very
likely
it
reminded
you
of
that
very
vicomtesse
with
whom
you
used
once
to
sing
and
of
whom
you
were
speaking
well
and
then
when
you
went
up
for
your
nap
and
lay
down
thinking
of
the
delightful
impressions
made
upon
you
by
the
ballad
and
all
you
dreamed
that
you
were
in
love
and
made
an
offer
of
marriage
to
the
lady
who
had
inspired
you
with
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
struck
dumb
by
this
display
of
barefaced
audacity
why
my
boy
yes
of
course
that
s
exactly
how
it
really
cried
the
prince
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
of
course
it
was
the
impressions
that
caused
me
to
dream
it
i
certainly
the
song
and
then
i
went
away
and
dreamed
about
my
and
that
i
really
wished
to
marry
the
viscountess
was
there
too
how
beautifully
you
have
unravelled
the
my
dear
boy
well
now
i
am
quite
convinced
that
it
was
all
a
dream
maria
i
assure
you
you
are
under
a
it
was
a
dream
i
should
not
think
of
trifling
with
your
feelings
oh
indeed
now
i
perceive
very
clearly
whom
we
have
to
thank
for
making
this
dirty
mess
of
our
affairs
cried
maria
alexandrovna
beside
herself
with
rage
and
turning
to
mosgliakoff
you
are
the
man
person
it
is
you
who
stirred
up
this
mud
it
is
you
that
puzzled
an
unhappy
old
idiot
into
this
eccentric
behaviour
because
you
yourself
were
rejected
but
we
shall
be
quits
my
friend
for
this
offence
you
shall
pay
you
shall
pay
wait
a
bit
my
dishonest
friend
wait
a
bit
maria
alexandrovna
cried
mosgliakoff
blushing
in
his
turn
until
he
looked
as
red
as
a
boiled
lobster
your
words
are
so
such
an
really
don
t
know
how
to
express
my
opinion
of
you
no
lady
would
ever
permit
herself
at
all
events
i
am
but
protecting
my
relative
you
must
allow
that
to
an
old
man
like
this
is
quite
so
quite
so
began
the
prince
trying
to
hide
himself
behind
mosgliakoff
afanassy
matveyevitch
cried
maria
alexandrovna
in
unnatural
tones
do
you
hear
sir
how
these
people
are
shaming
and
insulting
me
have
you
exempted
yourself
from
all
the
responsibilities
of
a
man
or
are
you
actually
wooden
block
instead
of
the
father
of
a
family
what
do
you
stand
blinking
there
for
eh
any
other
husband
would
have
wiped
out
such
an
insult
to
his
family
with
the
blood
of
the
offender
long
wife
began
afanassy
solemnly
delighted
and
proud
to
find
that
a
need
for
him
had
sprung
up
for
once
in
his
life
wife
are
you
quite
certain
now
that
did
not
dream
all
this
you
might
so
easily
have
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
it
and
then
muddled
it
all
up
with
what
really
happened
you
know
and
but
afanassy
matveyevitch
was
never
destined
to
complete
his
ingenious
but
unlucky
guess
up
to
this
moment
the
guests
had
all
restrained
themselves
and
had
managed
cleverly
enough
to
keep
up
an
appearance
of
solid
and
judicial
interest
in
the
proceedings
but
at
the
first
sound
almost
of
afanassy
s
voice
a
burst
of
uncontrollable
laughter
rose
like
a
tempest
from
all
parts
of
the
room
maria
alexandrovna
forgetting
all
the
laws
of
propriety
in
her
fury
tried
to
rush
at
her
unlucky
consort
but
she
was
held
back
by
force
or
doubtless
she
would
have
scratched
out
that
gentleman
s
eyes
natalia
dimitrievna
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
add
a
little
if
only
a
little
drop
more
of
poison
to
the
bitter
cup
but
dear
maria
alexandrovna
she
said
in
the
sweetest
honied
tones
perhaps
it
may
be
that
it
really
so
as
your
husband
suggests
and
that
you
are
actually
under
a
strange
delusion
how
what
was
a
delusion
cried
maria
alexandrovna
not
quite
catching
the
remark
why
my
dear
maria
i
was
saying
it
have
been
so
dear
after
all
these
sort
of
things
happen
sometimes
you
know
sort
of
things
do
happen
eh
what
are
you
trying
to
do
with
me
what
am
i
to
make
of
you
why
perhaps
dear
you
really
dream
it
all
what
it
dreamed
it
and
you
dare
suggest
such
a
thing
to
to
my
face
oh
why
not
perhaps
it
really
was
the
case
observed
felisata
michaelovna
quite
so
very
likely
it
the
case
muttered
the
old
prince
he
heaven
cried
poor
maria
alexandrovna
wringing
her
hands
dear
me
how
you
do
worry
yourself
maria
alexandrovna
you
should
remember
that
dreams
are
sent
us
by
a
good
providence
if
providence
so
wills
it
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
providence
gives
the
word
and
we
can
neither
weep
nor
be
angry
at
its
quite
so
quite
so
we
can
t
be
about
it
observed
the
prince
look
here
do
you
take
me
for
a
lunatic
or
not
said
maria
alexandrovna
she
spoke
with
difficulty
so
dreadfully
was
she
panting
with
fury
it
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
she
hurriedly
grasped
a
chair
and
fell
fainting
into
it
there
was
a
scene
of
great
excitement
she
has
fainted
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
propriety
observed
natalia
dimitrievna
to
antipova
but
at
this
this
moment
when
the
general
bewilderment
and
confusion
had
reached
its
height
and
when
the
scene
was
strained
to
the
last
possible
point
of
excitement
another
actor
suddenly
stepped
to
the
front
one
who
had
been
silent
hitherto
but
who
immediately
threw
quite
a
different
complexion
on
the
scene
chapter
xiv
zenaida
or
zina
afanassievna
was
an
individual
of
an
extremely
romantic
turn
of
mind
i
don
t
know
whether
it
really
was
that
she
had
read
too
much
of
that
fool
shakespeare
with
her
little
tutor
fellow
as
maria
alexandrovna
insisted
but
at
all
events
she
was
very
romantic
however
never
in
all
her
experience
of
mordasoff
life
had
zina
before
made
such
an
or
perhaps
i
might
call
it
display
as
on
the
occasion
of
the
sally
which
i
am
now
about
to
describe
pale
and
with
resolution
in
her
eyes
yet
almost
trembling
with
agitation
and
wonderfully
beautiful
in
her
anger
and
scorn
she
stepped
to
the
front
gazing
around
at
all
defiantly
she
approached
her
mother
in
the
midst
of
the
sudden
silence
which
had
fallen
on
all
present
her
mother
roused
herself
from
her
swoon
at
the
first
indication
of
a
projected
movement
on
zina
s
part
and
she
now
opened
her
eyes
mamma
cried
zina
why
should
we
deceive
anyone
why
befoul
ourselves
with
more
lies
everything
is
so
foul
already
that
surely
it
is
not
worth
while
to
bemean
ourselves
any
further
by
attempting
to
gloss
over
the
filth
zina
zina
what
are
you
thinking
of
recollect
yourself
cried
maria
alexandrovna
frightened
out
of
her
wits
and
jumping
briskly
up
from
her
chair
i
told
you
told
you
before
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
last
out
the
length
of
this
shameful
and
ignominious
business
continued
zina
surely
we
need
no
further
bemean
and
befoul
ourselves
i
will
take
it
all
on
myself
mamma
i
am
the
basest
of
all
for
lending
myself
of
my
own
free
will
to
this
abominable
intrigue
you
are
my
mother
you
love
me
i
know
and
you
wished
to
arrange
matters
for
my
happiness
as
you
thought
best
and
according
to
your
lights
conduct
therefore
is
pardonable
but
mine
oh
no
never
never
zina
zina
surely
you
are
not
going
to
tell
the
whole
story
oh
woe
woe
i
felt
that
the
knife
would
pierce
my
heart
yes
mamma
i
shall
tell
all
i
am
disgraced
all
of
us
are
zina
you
are
exaggerating
you
are
beside
yourself
and
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
saying
and
why
say
anything
about
it
the
ignominy
and
disgrace
is
not
on
our
side
dear
child
i
will
show
in
a
moment
that
it
is
not
on
our
side
no
mamma
no
cried
zina
with
a
quiver
of
rage
in
her
voice
i
do
not
wish
to
remain
silent
any
longer
before
whose
opinion
i
despise
and
who
have
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
laughing
at
us
i
do
not
wish
to
stand
insult
from
any
one
of
them
none
of
them
have
any
right
to
throw
dirt
at
me
every
single
one
of
them
would
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
do
things
thirty
times
as
bad
as
anything
either
i
or
you
have
done
or
would
do
dare
they
they
constitute
themselves
our
judges
listen
to
that
there
s
a
pretty
little
speech
for
you
why
that
s
she
s
abusing
a
nice
sort
of
creature
she
is
herself
these
and
other
exclamations
greeted
the
conclusion
of
zina
s
speech
oh
she
simply
doesn
t
know
what
she
s
talking
about
observed
natalia
dimitrievna
we
will
make
a
digression
and
remark
that
natalia
dimitrievna
was
quite
right
there
for
if
zina
did
not
consider
these
women
competent
to
judge
herself
why
should
she
trouble
herself
to
make
those
exposures
and
admissions
which
she
proposed
to
reveal
in
their
presence
zina
was
in
much
too
great
a
hurry
she
always
was
the
best
heads
in
mordasoff
had
agreed
all
might
have
been
set
right
all
might
have
been
satisfactorily
arranged
maria
alexandrovna
was
a
great
deal
to
blame
this
night
too
she
had
been
too
much
in
a
hurry
like
her
daughter
too
arrogant
she
should
have
simply
raised
the
laugh
at
the
old
prince
s
expense
and
turned
him
out
of
the
house
but
zina
in
despite
of
all
common
sense
as
indicated
above
and
of
the
sage
opinions
of
all
mordasoff
addressed
herself
to
the
prince
prince
she
said
to
the
old
man
who
actually
rose
from
his
to
show
his
respect
for
the
speaker
so
much
was
he
struck
by
her
at
this
moment
prince
forgive
us
we
have
deceived
you
we
entrapped
you
be
quiet
you
wretched
girl
cried
maria
alexandrovna
wild
with
rage
my
dear
young
dear
child
my
darling
child
murmured
the
admiring
prince
but
the
proud
haughty
character
of
zina
had
led
her
on
to
cross
the
barrier
of
all
propriety
even
forgot
her
own
mother
who
lay
fainting
at
her
victim
to
the
her
daughter
indulged
in
yes
prince
we
both
cheated
you
mamma
was
in
fault
in
that
she
determined
that
i
must
marry
you
and
i
in
that
i
consented
thereto
we
filled
you
with
wine
i
sang
to
you
and
postured
and
posed
for
your
admiration
we
tricked
you
a
weak
defenceless
old
man
we
you
as
mosgliakoff
would
express
it
for
the
sake
of
your
wealth
and
your
rank
all
this
was
shockingly
mean
and
i
freely
admit
the
fact
but
i
swear
to
you
prince
that
i
consented
to
all
this
baseness
from
motives
which
were
base
i
wished
what
a
wretch
i
am
it
is
doubly
mean
to
justify
one
s
conduct
in
such
a
case
as
this
but
i
will
tell
you
prince
that
if
i
had
accepted
anything
from
you
i
should
have
made
it
up
to
you
for
it
by
being
your
plaything
your
servant
ballet
dancer
your
you
wished
i
had
sworn
to
this
and
i
should
have
kept
my
a
severe
spasm
at
the
throat
stopped
her
for
a
moment
while
all
the
guests
sat
and
listened
like
so
many
blocks
of
wood
their
eyes
and
mouths
wide
open
this
unexpected
and
to
them
perfectly
unintelligible
sally
on
zina
s
part
had
utterly
confounded
them
the
old
prince
alone
was
touched
to
tears
though
he
did
not
understand
half
that
zina
said
but
i
will
marry
you
my
child
i
marry
you
if
you
like
murmured
and
it
a
great
honour
too
but
i
you
it
was
all
a
dream
does
it
what
i
dream
why
should
you
take
it
so
to
heart
i
don
t
seem
to
it
all
please
explain
my
dear
friend
what
it
all
means
he
added
to
paul
as
for
you
pavel
alexandrovitch
zina
recommenced
also
turning
to
mosgliakoff
you
whom
i
had
made
up
my
mind
at
one
time
to
look
upon
as
my
future
husband
you
who
have
now
so
cruelly
revenged
yourself
upon
me
must
you
needs
have
allied
yourself
to
these
people
here
whose
object
at
all
times
is
to
humiliate
and
shame
me
and
you
said
that
you
loved
me
however
it
is
not
for
me
to
preach
moralities
to
you
for
i
am
worse
than
all
i
wronged
you
distinctly
in
holding
out
false
hopes
and
half
promises
i
never
loved
you
and
if
i
had
agreed
to
be
your
wife
it
would
have
been
solely
with
the
view
of
getting
away
from
here
out
of
this
accursed
town
and
free
of
all
this
meanness
and
baseness
however
i
swear
to
you
that
had
i
married
you
i
should
have
been
a
good
and
faithful
wife
you
have
taken
a
cruel
vengeance
upon
me
and
if
that
flatters
your
pride
zina
cried
mosgliakoff
if
you
still
hate
zina
if
you
ever
did
love
zenaida
afanassievna
zina
child
cried
maria
alexandrovna
i
am
a
blackguard
blackguard
and
nothing
else
cried
mosgliakoff
while
all
the
assembled
ladies
gave
way
to
violent
agitation
cries
of
amazement
and
of
wrath
broke
upon
the
silence
but
mosgliakoff
himself
stood
speechless
and
miserable
without
a
thought
and
without
a
word
to
plead
for
him
i
am
an
ass
zina
he
cried
at
last
in
an
outburst
of
wild
despair
an
ass
oh
far
far
worse
than
an
ass
but
i
will
prove
to
you
zina
that
even
an
ass
can
behave
like
a
generous
human
being
uncle
i
cheated
you
i
was
i
who
cheated
you
you
were
asleep
were
wide
awake
when
you
made
this
lady
an
offer
of
marriage
and
that
i
of
revenge
because
i
was
rejected
by
her
myself
persuaded
you
that
you
had
dreamed
it
all
dear
me
what
wonderful
and
interesting
revelations

are
being
treated
to
now
whispered
natalia
to
antipova

the
prince

assure
quite
me
with
that
sudden
of
yours
besides
you
are
labouring
under
a
delusion

if
but
you
told
me

and
then
we
seemed
to
be
sitting
at
tea
and
some
came
and
ate
up
all
our
but
uncle
cried
mosgliakoff
at
his
wits
end
it
was
maria
alexandrovna
herself

us
that
anecdote
about
natalia
dimitrievna
i
was
here

and

unexpected
disclosures

charming

my
friend
good
what
people
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
end
of
this
disagreeable
scene
after
the
prince
s
departure
the
guests
separated
in
a
hurricane
of
scolding
and
abuse
and
mutual
vituperation
and
maria
alexandrovna
was
at
last
left
alone
amid
the
ruins
and
relics
of
her
departed
glory
alas
alas
power
glory
had
disappeared
in
this
one
unfortunate
evening
maria
alexandrovna
quite
realised
that
there
was
no
chance
of
her
ever
again
mounting
to
the
height
from
which
she
had
now
fallen
her
long
preeminence
and
despotism
over
society
in
general
had
collapsed
what
remained
to
her
philosophy
she
was
wild
with
the
madness
of
despair
all
night
zina
was
would
circulate
scandals
it
was
dreadful
as
a
faithful
historian
i
must
record
that
poor
afanassy
was
the
scapegoat
this
night
he
caught
it
so
terribly
that
he
eventually
disappeared
he
had
hidden
himself
in
the
garret
and
was
there
starved
to
death
almost
with
cold
all
night
the
morning
came
at
last
but
it
brought
nothing
good
with
it
misfortunes
never
come
singly
chapter
xv
if
fate
makes
up
its
mind
to
visit
anyone
with
misfortune
there
is
no
end
to
its
malice
this
fact
has
often
been
remarked
by
thinkers
and
as
if
the
ignominy
of
last
night
were
not
enough
the
same
malicious
destiny
had
prepared
for
this
family
more
yea
and
to
come
by
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
a
strange
and
almost
incredible
rumour
was
in
full
swing
all
over
the
town
it
was
received
by
society
of
course
with
full
measure
of
spiteful
joy
just
as
we
all
love
to
receive
delightfully
scandalous
stories
of
anyone
about
us
to
lose
one
s
sense
of
shame
to
such
an
extent
people
said
one
to
another
to
humiliate
oneself
so
and
to
neglect
the
first
rules
of
propriety
to
loose
the
bands
of
decency
altogether
like
this
really
etc
but
here
is
what
had
happened
early
in
the
morning
something
after
six
o
clock
a
poor
old
woman
came
hurriedly
to
the
door
of
maria
alexandrovna
s
house
and
begged
the
maid
to
wake
miss
zina
up
as
quickly
as
possible
miss
zina
and
very
quietly
so
that
her
mother
should
not
hear
of
it
if
possible
zina
pale
and
miserable
ran
out
to
the
old
woman
immediately
the
latter
fell
at
zina
s
feet
and
kissed
them
and
begged
her
with
tears
to
come
with
her
at
once
to
see
poor
vaísia
her
son
who
had
been
so
bad
bad
all
night
that
she
did
not
think
he
could
live
another
day
the
old
woman
told
zina
that
vaísia
had
sent
to
beg
her
to
come
and
bid
him
farewell
in
this
his
death
hour
he
conjured
her
to
come
by
all
the
blessed
angels
and
by
all
their
he
must
die
in
despair
zina
at
once
decided
to
go
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
by
so
doing
she
would
be
justifying
all
the
scandal
and
slanders
disseminated
about
her
in
former
days
as
to
the
intercepted
letter
her
visits
to
him
and
so
on
without
a
word
to
her
mother
then
she
donned
her
cloak
and
started
off
with
the
old
woman
passing
through
the
whole
length
of
the
town
into
one
of
the
poorest
slums
of
stopped
at
a
little
low
wretched
house
with
small
miserable
windows
and
snow
piled
round
the
basement
for
warmth
in
this
house
in
a
tiny
room
more
than
half
of
which
was
occupied
by
an
enormous
stove
on
a
wretched
bed
and
covered
with
a
miserably
thin
quilt
lay
a
young
man
pale
and
haggard
his
eyes
were
ablaze
with
the
fire
of
fever
his
hands
were
dry
and
thin
and
he
was
breathing
with
difficulty
and
very
hoarsely
he
looked
as
though
he
might
have
been
handsome
once
but
disease
had
put
its
finger
on
his
features
and
made
them
dreadful
to
look
upon
and
sad
withal
as
are
so
many
dying
consumptive
patients
faces
his
old
mother
who
had
fed
herself
for
a
year
past
with
the
conviction
that
her
son
would
recover
now
saw
at
last
that
vaísia
was
not
to
live
she
stood
over
him
bowed
down
with
her
and
looked
and
looked
and
could
not
look
enough
and
felt
but
could
not
realize
that
this
dear
son
of
hers
must
in
a
few
days
be
buried
in
the
miserable
mordasof
churchyard
far
down
beneath
the
snow
and
frozen
earth
but
vaísia
was
not
looking
at
her
at
this
moment
his
poor
suffering
face
was
at
rest
now
and
happy
for
he
saw
before
him
the
dear
image
which
he
had
thought
of
dreamed
of
and
loved
through
all
the
long
sad
nights
of
his
illness
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
he
realised
that
she
forgave
him
and
had
come
like
an
angel
of
god
to
tell
him
of
her
forgiveness
here
on
his
deathbed
she
pressed
his
hands
wept
over
him
stood
and
smiled
over
him
looked
at
him
once
more
with
those
wonderful
eyes
of
hers
and
all
the
past
the
undying
past
rose
up
before
the
mind
s
eye
of
the
dying
man
the
spark
of
life
flashed
up
again
in
his
soul
as
though
to
show
now
that
it
was
about
to
die
out
for
ever
on
this
earth
how
hard
how
hard
it
was
to
see
so
sweet
a
light
fade
away
zina
zina
he
said
my
zina
do
not
weep
don
t
grieve
zina
don
t
remind
me
that
i
must
die
let
me
gaze
at
you
feel
that
our
two
souls
have
come
together
once
you
have
forgiven
me
let
me
kiss
your
dear
hands
again
as
i
used
and
so
let
me
die
without
noticing
the
approach
of
death
how
thin
you
have
grown
zina
and
how
sweetly
you
are
looking
at
me
now
my
zina
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
laugh
in
bygone
days
oh
zina
my
angel
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
will
not
remember
anything
you
know
what
for
if
you
forgive
me
i
can
never
forgive
myself
all
the
long
long
nights
zina
i
have
lain
here
and
thought
and
thought
and
i
have
long
since
decided
that
i
had
better
die
zina
for
i
am
not
fit
to
live
zina
wept
and
silently
pressed
his
hands
as
though
she
would
stop
him
talking
so
why
do
you
cry
so
continued
the
sick
man
is
it
because
i
am
dying
but
all
the
past
is
long
since
dead
and
buried
zina
my
angel
you
are
wiser
than
i
am
you
know
i
am
a
bad
wicked
man
surely
you
can
not
love
me
still
do
you
know
what
it
has
cost
me
to
realise
that
i
am
a
bad
man
i
who
have
always
prided
myself
before
the
what
on
purity
of
heart
generosity
of
aim
yes
zina
so
i
did
while
we
read
shakespeare
and
in
theory
i
was
pure
and
generous
yet
how
did
i
prove
these
qualities
in
practice
oh
don
t
don
t
sobbed
zina
you
are
not
fair
to
yourself
don
t
talk
like
this
please
don
t
don
t
stop
me
zina
you
forgave
me
my
angel
i
know
you
forgave
me
long
ago
but
you
must
have
judged
me
and
you
know
what
sort
of
man
i
really
am
and
that
is
what
tortures
me
so
i
am
unworthy
of
your
love
zina
and
you
were
good
and
true
not
only
in
theory
but
in
practice
too
you
told
your
mother
you
would
marry
me
and
no
one
else
and
you
would
have
kept
your
word
do
you
know
zina
i
never
realized
before
what
you
would
sacrifice
in
marrying
me
i
could
not
even
see
that
you
might
die
of
hunger
if
you
did
so
all
i
thought
of
was
that
you
would
be
the
bride
of
a
great
poet
in
the
future
and
i
could
not
understand
your
reasons
for
wishing
to
delay
our
union
so
i
reproached
you
and
bullied
you
and
despised
you
and
suspected
you
and
at
last
i
committed
the
crime
of
showing
your
letter
i
was
not
even
a
scoundrel
at
that
moment
i
was
simply
a
ah
how
you
must
have
despised
me
no
it
is
well
that
i
am
dying
it
is
well
that
you
did
not
marry
me
i
should
not
have
understood
your
sacrifice
and
i
should
have
worried
you
and
perhaps
in
time
have
learned
to
hate
you
and
but
now
it
is
good
it
is
best
so
my
bitter
tears
can
at
least
cleanse
my
heart
before
i
die
ah
zina
zina
love
me
love
me
as
you
did
before
for
a
little
little
while
just
for
the
last
hour
of
my
life
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
it
my
angel
my
zina
throughout
this
speech
zina
sobbing
herself
had
several
times
tried
to
stop
the
speaker
but
he
would
not
listen
he
felt
that
he
must
unburden
his
soul
by
speaking
out
and
continued
to
with
difficulty
panting
and
with
choking
and
husky
utterance
oh
if
only
you
had
never
seen
me
and
never
loved
me
said
zina
you
would
have
lived
on
now
ah
did
we
ever
meet
no
no
darling
don
t
blame
yourself
because
i
am
dying
think
of
all
my
my
romanticism
i
am
to
blame
for
all
myself
did
they
ever
tell
you
my
story
in
full
do
you
remember
three
years
ago
there
was
a
criminal
here
sentenced
to
death
this
man
heard
that
a
criminal
was
never
executed
whilst
ill
so
he
got
hold
of
some
wine
mixed
tobacco
in
it
and
drank
it
the
effect
was
to
make
him
so
dreadfully
sick
with
that
his
lungs
became
affected
he
was
taken
to
a
hospital
and
a
few
weeks
after
he
died
of
virulent
consumption
well
on
that
day
you
know
after
the
letter
it
struck
me
that
i
would
do
the
same
and
why
do
you
think
i
chose
consumption
because
i
was
afraid
of
any
more
sudden
death
perhaps
but
oh
zina
believe
me
a
romantic
nonsense
played
a
great
part
in
it
at
all
events
i
had
an
idea
that
it
would
be
striking
and
grand
for
me
to
be
lying
here
dying
of
consumption
and
you
standing
and
wringing
your
hands
for
woe
that
should
have
brought
me
to
this
you
should
come
i
thought
and
beg
my
pardon
on
your
knees
and
i
should
forgive
you
and
die
in
your
arms
oh
don
t
don
t
said
zina
don
t
talk
of
it
now
dear
you
are
not
really
like
that
think
of
our
happy
days
together
think
of
something
that
not
that
oh
but
it
s
so
bitter
to
me
darling
and
that
s
why
i
must
speak
of
it
i
havn
t
seen
you
for
a
year
and
a
half
you
know
and
all
that
time
i
have
been
alone
and
i
don
t
think
there
was
one
single
minute
of
all
that
time
when
i
have
not
thought
of
you
my
angel
zina
and
oh
how
i
longed
to
do
something
to
earn
a
better
opinion
from
you
up
to
these
very
last
days
i
have
never
believed
that
i
should
really
die
it
has
not
killed
me
all
at
once
you
know
i
have
long
walked
about
with
my
lungs
affected
for
instance
i
have
longed
to
become
a
great
poet
suddenly
to
publish
a
poem
such
as
has
never
appeared
before
on
this
earth
i
intended
to
pour
my
whole
soul
and
being
into
it
so
that
wherever
i
was
or
wherever
were
i
should
always
be
with
you
and
remind
you
of
myself
in
my
poems
and
my
greatest
longing
of
all
was
that
you
should
think
it
all
over
and
say
to
yourself
at
last
some
day
no
he
is
not
such
a
wretch
as
i
thought
after
all
it
was
stupid
of
me
zina
t
it
darling
no
no
cried
zina
she
fell
on
his
breast
and
kissed
his
poor
hot
dry
hands
and
oh
how
jealous
i
have
been
of
you
all
this
time
zina
i
think
i
should
have
died
if
i
had
heard
of
your
wedding
i
kept
a
watch
over
you
you
know
i
had
a
he
nodded
towards
his
mother
she
used
to
go
over
and
bring
me
news
you
never
loved
you
zina
oh
my
darling
my
darling
will
you
remember
me
when
i
am
dead
oh
i
know
you
will
but
years
go
by
zina
and
hearts
grow
cold
and
yours
will
cool
too
and
you
ll
forget
me
zina
no
no
never
i
shall
never
marry
you
are
my
first
love
and
my
love
but
all
things
die
zina
even
our
memories
and
our
good
and
noble
feelings
die
also
and
in
their
place
comes
reason
no
no
zina
be
happy
and
live
long
love
another
if
you
can
you
can
not
love
a
poor
dead
man
for
ever
but
think
of
me
now
and
then
if
only
seldom
don
t
think
of
my
faults
forgive
them
for
oh
zina
there
was
good
in
that
sweet
love
of
ours
as
well
as
evil
oh
golden
golden
days
never
to
be
recalled
listen
darling
i
have
always
loved
the
sunset
me
at
that
time
will
you
oh
no
no
why
must
i
die
oh
i
should
love
to
live
on
now
think
of
that
just
think
of
it
it
was
all
spring
then
the
sun
shone
so
bright
the
flowers
were
so
sweet
ah
me
and
look
and
the
poor
thin
finger
pointed
to
the
frozen
then
he
seized
zina
s
hand
and
pressed
it
tight
over
his
eyes
and
sighed
his
sobs
nearly
burst
his
poor
suffering
breast
and
so
he
continued
suffering
and
talking
all
the
long
day
zina
comforted
and
soothed
him
as
she
best
could
but
she
too
was
full
of
deadly
grief
and
pain
she
told
promised
to
forget
that
she
would
never
love
again
as
she
loved
him
and
he
believed
her
and
wept
and
smiled
again
and
kissed
her
hands
and
so
the
day
passed
meanwhile
maria
alexandrovna
had
sent
some
ten
times
for
zina
begging
her
not
to
ruin
her
reputation
irretrievably
at
last
at
dusk
she
determined
to
go
herself
she
was
out
of
her
wits
with
terror
and
grief
having
called
zina
out
into
the
next
room
she
proceeded
to
beg
and
pray
her
on
her
knees
to
spare
this
last
dagger
at
her
heart
zina
had
come
out
from
the
ill
her
head
was
on
fire
heard
but
could
not
comprehend
what
her
mother
said
and
marie
alexandrovna
was
obliged
to
leave
the
house
again
in
despair
for
zina
had
determined
to
sit
up
all
night
with
vaísia
she
never
left
his
bedside
but
the
poor
fellow
grew
worse
and
worse
another
day
came
but
there
was
no
hope
that
the
sick
man
would
see
its
close
his
old
mother
walked
about
as
though
she
had
lost
all
control
of
her
actions
grief
had
turned
her
head
for
the
time
she
gave
her
son
medicines
but
he
would
none
of
them
his
death
agony
dragged
on
and
on
he
could
not
speak
now
and
only
hoarse
inarticulate
sounds
proceeded
from
his
throat
to
the
very
last
instant
he
stared
and
stared
at
zina
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
and
when
their
light
failed
them
he
still
groped
with
uncertain
fingers
for
her
hand
to
press
and
fondle
it
in
his
own
meanwhile
the
short
winter
day
was
waning
and
when
at
even
the
last
sunbeam
gilded
the
frozen
of
the
little
room
the
soul
of
the
sufferer
fled
in
pursuit
of
it
out
of
the
emaciated
body
that
had
kept
it
prisoner
the
old
mother
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
left
her
now
but
the
lifeless
body
of
her
beloved
vaísia
wrung
her
hands
and
with
a
loud
cry
flung
herself
on
his
dead
breast
this
is
your
doing
you
viper
you
cursed
snake
she
yelled
to
zina
in
her
despair
it
was
you
ruined
and
killed
him
you
wicked
wretched
but
zina
heard
nothing
she
stood
over
the
dead
body
like
one
bereft
of
her
senses
at
last
she
bent
over
him
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
kissed
him
and
mechanically
left
the
room
her
eyes
were
ablaze
her
head
whirled
two
nights
without
sleep
combined
with
her
turbulent
feelings
were
almost
too
much
for
her
reason
she
had
a
sort
of
confused
consciousness
that
all
her
past
had
just
been
torn
out
of
her
heart
and
that
a
new
life
was
beginning
for
her
dark
and
threatening
but
she
had
not
gone
ten
paces
when
mosgliakoff
suddenly
seemed
to
start
up
from
the
earth
at
her
feet
he
must
have
been
waiting
for
her
here
zenaida
afanassievna
he
began
peering
all
around
him
in
what
looked
like
timid
haste
it
was
still
pretty
light
zenaida
afanassievna
of
course
i
am
an
ass
or
if
you
please
perhaps
not
quite
an
ass
for
i
really
think
i
am
acting
rather
generously
this
time
excuse
my
blundering
but
i
am
rather
confused
from
a
variety
of
zina
glanced
at
him
almost
unconsciously
and
silently
went
on
her
way
there
was
not
much
room
for
two
on
the
narrow
pavement
and
as
zina
did
not
make
way
for
paul
the
latter
was
obliged
to
walk
on
the
road
at
the
side
which
he
did
never
taking
his
eyes
off
her
face
zenaida
afanassievna
he
continued
i
have
thought
it
all
over
and
if
you
are
agreeable
i
am
willing
to
renew
my
proposal
of
marriage
i
am
even
ready
to
forget
all
that
has
happened
all
the
ignominy
of
the
last
two
days
and
to
forgive
on
one
condition
that
while
we
are
still
here
our
engagement
is
to
remain
a
strict
secret
you
will
depart
from
this
place
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
and
i
shall
quietly
follow
you
we
will
be
married
secretly
somewhere
so
that
nobody
shall
know
anything
about
it
and
then
we
ll
be
off
to
petersburg
by
express
t
take
more
than
a
small
what
say
you
zenaida
afanassievna
tell
me
quick
please
i
can
t
stay
here
we
might
be
seen
together
you
zina
did
not
answer
a
word
she
only
looked
at
mosgliakoff
but
it
was
such
a
look
that
he
understood
all
instantly
bowed
and
disappeared
down
the
next
lane
dear
me
he
said
to
himself
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
the
day
before
yesterday
she
became
so
jolly
humble
and
blamed
herself
all
round
i
ve
come
on
the
wrong
day
evidently
meanwhile
event
followed
event
in
mordasof
a
very
tragical
circumstance
occurred
the
old
prince
who
moved
over
to
the
hotel
with
mosgliakoff
fell
very
ill
that
same
night
dangerously
all
mordasof
knew
of
it
in
the
morning
the
doctor
never
left
his
side
that
evening
a
consultation
of
all
the
local
medical
talent
was
held
over
the
old
man
the
invitations
to
which
were
issued
in
latin
but
in
spite
of
the
latin
and
all
they
could
do
for
him
the
poor
prince
was
quite
off
his
head
he
raved
and
asked
his
doctor
to
sing
him
some
ballad
or
other
raved
about
wigs
and
occasionally
cried
out
as
though
frightened
the
mordasof
doctors
decided
that
the
hospitality
of
the
town
had
given
the
prince
inflammation
of
the
stomach
which
had
somehow
gone
to
the
there
might
be
some
subordinate
moral
causes
to
account
for
the
attack
but
at
all
events
he
ought
to
have
died
long
ago
and
so
he
would
certainly
die
now
in
this
last
conclusion
they
were
not
far
wrong
for
the
poor
old
prince
breathed
his
last
three
days
after
at
the
hotel
this
event
impressed
the
mordasof
folk
considerably
no
one
had
expected
such
a
tragical
turn
of
affairs
they
went
in
troops
to
the
hotel
to
view
the
poor
old
body
and
there
they
wagged
their
heads
wisely
and
ended
by
passing
severe
judgment
upon
the
murderers
of
the
unfortunate
prince
thereby
of
course
maria
alexandrovna
and
her
daughter
they
predicted
that
this
matter
would
go
further
mosgliakoff
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
perturbation
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
body
should
he
take
it
back
to
donchanof
or
what
perhaps
he
would
be
held
responsible
for
the
old
man
s
death
as
he
had
brought
him
here
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
the
mordasof
people
were
less
than
useless
for
advice
they
were
all
far
too
frightened
to
hazard
a
word
but
suddenly
the
scene
changed
one
fine
evening
a
visitor
less
a
person
than
the
eminent
prince
shepetiloff
a
young
man
of
with
colonel
s
epaulettes
a
relative
of
the
dead
man
his
arrival
created
a
great
stir
among
all
classes
at
mordasof
it
appeared
that
this
gentleman
had
lately
left
petersburg
and
had
called
in
at
donchanof
finding
no
one
there
he
had
followed
the
prince
to
mordasof
where
the
news
and
circumstances
of
the
old
man
s
death
fell
upon
him
like
a
even
the
governor
felt
a
little
guilty
while
detailing
the
story
of
the
prince
s
death
all
mordasof
felt
and
looked
guilty
this
visitor
took
the
matter
entirely
into
his
own
hands
and
mosgliakoff
made
himself
scarce
before
the
presence
of
the
prince
s
real
nephew
and
disappeared
no
one
knew
whither
the
body
was
taken
to
the
monastery
and
all
the
mordasof
ladies
flocked
thither
to
the
funeral
it
was
rumoured
that
maria
alexandrovna
was
to
be
present
and
that
she
was
to
go
on
her
knees
before
the
coffin
and
loudly
pray
for
pardon
and
that
all
this
was
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
the
country
of
course
this
was
all
nonsense
and
maria
alexandrovna
never
went
near
the
place
i
forgot
to
state
that
the
latter
had
carried
off
zina
to
the
country
house
not
deeming
it
possible
to
continue
to
live
in
the
town
there
she
sat
and
trembled
over
all
the
news
she
could
get
hold
of
as
to
events
occurring
at
mordasof
the
funeral
procession
passed
within
half
a
mile
of
her
country
house
so
that
maria
alexandrovna
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
long
train
of
carriages
looking
black
against
the
white
snow
roads
but
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
and
left
the
window
before
the
week
was
out
she
and
her
daughter
moved
to
moscow
taking
afanassy
matveyevitch
with
them
and
within
a
month
the
country
house
and
town
house
were
both
for
sale
and
so
mordasof
lost
its
most
eminent
inhabitant
for
ever
afanassy
matveyevitch
was
said
to
be
for
sale
with
the
country
house
a
years
went
by
and
mordasof
had
quite
forgotten
maria
alexandrovna
or
nearly
so
alas
so
wags
the
world
it
was
said
that
she
had
bought
another
estate
and
had
moved
over
to
some
other
provincial
capital
where
of
course
she
had
everybody
under
her
thumb
that
zina
was
not
yet
married
and
that
afanassy
why
repeat
all
this
nonsense
none
of
it
was
true
it
was
but
rumour
it
is
three
years
since
i
wrote
the
last
words
of
the
above
chronicles
of
mordasof
and
whoever
would
have
believed
that
i
should
have
to
unfold
my
and
add
another
piece
of
news
to
my
narrative
well
to
business
let
s
begin
with
paul
leaving
mordasof
he
went
straight
to
petersburg
where
he
very
soon
obtained
the
clerkship
he
had
applied
for
he
then
promptly
forgot
all
about
mordasof
and
the
events
enacted
there
he
enjoyed
life
went
into
society
fell
in
love
made
another
offer
of
marriage
and
had
to
swallow
another
snub
became
disgusted
with
petersburg
life
and
joined
an
expedition
to
one
of
the
remote
quarters
of
our
vast
empire
this
expedition
passed
through
its
perils
of
land
and
water
and
arrived
in
due
course
at
the
capital
of
the
remote
province
which
was
its
destination
there
the
members
were
well
received
by
the
governor
and
a
ball
was
arranged
for
their
entertainment
mosgliakoff
was
delighted
he
donned
his
best
petersburg
uniform
and
proceeded
to
the
large
with
the
full
intention
of
producing
a
great
and
startling
effect
his
first
duty
was
to
make
his
bow
to
the
s
lady
of
whom
it
was
rumoured
that
she
was
young
and
very
lovely
he
advanced
then
with
some
little
swagger
but
was
suddenly
rooted
to
the
spot
with
amazement
before
him
stood
zina
beautifully
dressed
proud
and
haughty
and
sparkling
with
diamonds
she
did
not
recognize
him
her
eyes
rested
a
moment
on
his
face
and
then
passed
on
to
glance
at
some
other
person
paul
immediately
departed
to
a
safe
and
quiet
corner
and
there
a
young
civilian
whom
he
questioned
and
from
whom
he
learned
certain
most
interesting
facts
he
learned
that
the
had
married
a
very
rich
and
very
lovely
lady
in
moscow
two
years
since
that
his
wife
was
certainly
very
beautiful
but
at
the
same
time
excessively
proud
and
haughty
and
danced
with
none
but
generals
that
the
governor
s
lady
had
a
mother
a
lady
of
rank
and
fashion
who
had
followed
them
from
moscow
that
this
lady
was
very
clever
and
wise
but
that
even
she
was
quite
under
the
thumb
of
her
daughter
as
for
the
general
the
governor
he
doted
on
his
wife
mosgliakoff
inquired
after
our
old
friend
afanassy
but
in
their
remote
province
nothing
was
known
of
that
gentleman
feeling
a
little
more
at
home
presently
paul
began
to
walk
about
the
room
and
shortly
espied
maria
alexandrovna
herself
she
was
wonderfully
dressed
and
was
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
ladies
who
evidently
dwelt
in
the
glory
of
her
patronage
she
appeared
to
be
exceedingly
amiable
to
so
paul
plucked
up
courage
and
introduced
himself
maria
alexandrovna
seemed
to
give
a
shudder
at
first
sight
of
him
but
in
an
instant
she
was
herself
again
she
was
kind
enough
to
recognise
paul
and
to
ask
him
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
his
petersburg
experiences
and
so
on
she
never
said
a
word
about
mordasof
however
she
behaved
as
though
no
such
place
existed
after
a
minute
or
so
and
having
dropped
a
question
as
to
some
petersburg
prince
whom
paul
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
she
turned
to
speak
to
another
young
gentleman
standing
by
and
in
a
second
or
two
was
entirely
oblivious
of
mosgliakoff
with
a
sarcastic
smile
our
friend
passed
on
into
the
large
hall
feeling
he
knew
not
decided
not
to
dance
so
he
leant
his
back
against
one
of
the
pillars
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
did
nothing
but
follow
zina
about
with
his
eyes
but
alas
all
the
grace
of
his
figure
and
attitude
and
all
the
fascinations
of
his
general
appearance
were
lost
upon
her
she
never
looked
at
him
at
last
with
legs
stiff
from
standing
tired
hungry
and
feeling
miserable
generally
he
went
home
here
he
tossed
about
half
the
night
thinking
of
the
past
and
next
morning
having
the
chance
of
joining
a
branch
party
of
his
expedition
he
accepted
the
opportunity
with
delight
and
left
the
town
at
once
the
bells
tinkled
the
horses
trotted
gaily
along
kicking
up
snowballs
as
they
went
paul
mosgliakoff
fell
to
thinking
then
he
fell
to
snoring
and
so
he
continued
until
the
third
station
from
the
start
there
he
awoke
fresh
and
jolly
and
with
the
new
scenery
came
newer
and
healthier
and
pleasanter
thoughts
the
end
of
uncle
s
the
permanent
husband
chapter
i
summer
had
come
and
velchaninoff
contrary
to
his
expectations
was
still
in
petersburg
his
trip
to
the
south
of
russia
had
fallen
through
and
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
business
which
had
detained
him
this
was
a
lawsuit
as
to
certain
taken
a
very
disagreeable
aspect
three
months
ago
the
thing
had
appeared
to
be
by
no
means
fact
there
had
seemed
to
be
scarcely
any
question
as
to
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
matter
but
all
seemed
to
change
suddenly
everything
else
seems
to
have
changed
for
the
worse
too
said
velchaninoff
to
himself
over
and
over
again
he
was
employing
a
clever
eminent
man
and
an
expensive
one
too
but
in
his
impatience
and
suspicion
he
began
to
interfere
in
the
matter
himself
he
read
and
wrote
of
which
the
lawyer
put
into
his
called
in
continually
at
the
courts
and
offices
made
inquiries
and
confused
and
worried
everybody
concerned
in
the
matter
so
at
least
the
lawyer
declared
and
begged
him
for
mercy
s
sake
to
go
away
to
the
country
somewhere
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
do
so
he
stayed
in
town
and
enjoyed
the
dust
and
the
hot
nights
and
the
closeness
of
the
air
of
petersburg
things
which
are
enough
to
destroy
anyone
s
nerves
his
lodgings
were
somewhere
near
the
great
theatre
he
had
lately
taken
them
and
did
not
like
them
nothing
went
well
with
him
his
hypochondria
increased
with
each
day
and
he
had
long
been
a
victim
to
that
disorder
velchaninoff
was
a
man
who
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
he
was
not
quite
young
years
or
so
and
all
this
old
age
as
he
called
it
had
fallen
upon
him
quite
however
as
he
himself
well
understood
he
had
aged
more
in
the
than
in
the
number
of
the
years
of
his
life
and
if
his
infirmities
were
really
creeping
upon
him
they
must
have
come
from
within
and
not
from
outside
causes
he
looked
young
enough
still
he
was
a
tall
stout
man
with
thick
hair
without
a
suspicion
of
white
about
it
and
a
light
beard
that
reached
half
way
down
his
chest
at
first
sight
you
might
have
supposed
him
to
be
of
a
lax
careless
disposition
or
character
but
on
studying
him
more
closely
you
would
have
found
that
on
the
contrary
the
man
was
decidedly
a
stickler
for
the
proprieties
of
this
world
and
withal
brought
up
in
the
ways
and
graces
of
the
very
best
society
his
manners
were
very
but
spite
of
this
habit
of
grumbling
and
reviling
things
in
general
he
was
still
full
of
the
most
perfect
aristocratic
probably
he
did
not
himself
suspect
to
how
great
an
extent
this
was
so
though
he
was
a
most
decidedly
intelligent
i
may
say
clever
even
talented
man
his
open
face
was
distinguished
by
an
almost
feminine
refinement
which
quality
gained
him
much
attention
from
the
fair
sex
he
had
large
blue
which
ten
years
ago
had
known
well
how
to
persuade
and
attract
such
clear
merry
careless
eyes
they
had
been
that
they
invariably
brought
over
to
his
side
any
person
he
wished
to
gain
now
when
he
was
nearly
forty
years
old
their
ancient
kind
frank
expression
had
died
out
of
them
and
a
certain
irony
very
often
and
yet
another
variety
of
expression
of
expression
of
melancholy
or
pain
undefined
but
keen
had
taken
the
place
of
the
earlier
attractive
qualities
of
his
eyes
this
expression
of
melancholy
especially
showed
itself
when
he
was
alone
and
it
was
a
strange
fact
that
the
gay
careless
happy
fellow
of
a
couple
of
years
ago
the
man
who
could
tell
a
funny
story
so
inimitably
should
now
love
nothing
so
well
as
to
be
all
alone
he
intended
to
throw
up
most
of
his
quite
unnecessary
step
in
spite
of
his
present
financial
difficulties
probably
his
vanity
was
to
blame
for
this
intention
he
could
not
bear
to
see
his
old
friends
in
his
present
position
with
his
vain
suspicious
character
it
would
be
most
unpalatable
to
him
but
his
vanity
began
to
change
its
nature
in
solitude
it
did
not
grow
less
on
the
contrary
but
it
seemed
to
develop
into
a
special
type
of
vanity
which
was
unlike
its
old
self
this
new
vanity
suffered
from
entirely
different
causes
causes
if
i
may
so
express
it
he
said
and
if
there
really
be
higher
and
lower
motives
in
this
he
defined
these
higher
things
as
matters
which
he
could
not
laugh
at
or
turn
to
ridicule
when
happening
in
his
own
individual
experience
of
course
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
with
the
same
subjects
in
society
by
he
could
not
ridicule
then
but
put
him
among
other
people
and
he
would
be
the
first
to
tear
himself
from
all
of
those
secret
resolutions
of
his
conscience
made
in
solitude
and
laugh
them
to
scorn
very
often
on
rising
from
his
bed
in
the
morning
he
would
feel
ashamed
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
had
animated
him
during
the
long
sleepless
his
nights
of
late
had
been
sleepless
he
seemed
suspicious
of
everything
and
everybody
great
and
small
and
grew
mistrustful
of
himself
one
fact
stood
out
clearly
and
that
was
that
during
those
sleepless
nights
his
thoughts
and
opinions
took
huge
leaps
and
bounds
sometimes
changing
entirely
from
the
thoughts
and
opinions
of
the
daytime
this
fact
struck
him
very
forcibly
and
he
took
occasion
to
consult
an
eminent
medical
friend
he
spoke
in
fun
but
the
doctor
informed
him
that
the
fact
of
feelings
and
opinions
changing
during
meditations
at
night
and
during
sleeplessness
was
one
long
recognised
by
science
and
that
that
was
especially
the
case
with
persons
of
strong
thinking
power
and
of
acute
feelings
he
stated
further
that
very
often
the
beliefs
of
a
whole
life
are
uprooted
under
the
melancholy
influence
of
night
and
inability
to
sleep
and
that
often
the
most
fateful
resolutions
are
made
under
the
same
influence
that
sometimes
this
impressionability
to
the
mystic
influence
of
the
dark
hours
amounted
to
a
malady
in
which
case
measures
must
be
taken
the
radical
manner
of
living
should
be
changed
diet
considered
a
journey
undertaken
if
possible
etc
velchaninoff
listened
no
further
but
he
was
sure
that
in
his
own
case
there
was
decided
malady
very
soon
his
morning
meditations
began
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
those
of
the
night
but
they
were
more
bitter
certain
events
of
his
life
now
began
to
recur
to
his
memory
more
and
more
vividly
they
would
strike
him
suddenly
and
without
apparent
reason
things
which
had
been
forgotten
for
ten
or
fifteen
so
long
ago
that
he
thought
it
miraculous
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
recall
them
at
all
but
that
was
not
after
all
what
man
who
has
seen
any
life
has
not
hundreds
of
such
recollections
of
the
past
the
principal
point
was
that
all
this
past
came
back
to
him
now
with
an
absolutely
new
light
thrown
upon
it
and
he
seemed
to
look
at
it
from
an
entirely
new
and
unexpected
point
of
view
why
did
some
of
his
acts
appear
to
him
now
to
be
nothing
better
than
crimes
it
was
not
merely
in
the
judgment
of
his
intellect
that
these
things
appeared
so
to
him
it
been
only
his
poor
sick
mind
he
would
not
have
trusted
it
but
his
whole
being
seemed
to
condemn
him
he
would
curse
and
even
weep
over
these
recollections
of
the
past
if
anyone
had
told
him
a
couple
of
years
since
that
he
would
over
anything
he
would
have
laughed
the
idea
to
scorn
at
first
he
recalled
the
unpleasant
experiences
of
his
life
certain
failures
in
society
humiliations
he
remembered
how
some
designing
person
had
so
successfully
blackened
his
character
that
he
was
requested
to
cease
his
visits
to
a
certain
house
how
once
and
not
so
very
long
ago
he
had
been
publicly
insulted
and
had
not
challenged
the
offender
how
once
an
epigram
had
been
fastened
to
his
name
by
some
witty
person
in
the
midst
of
a
party
of
pretty
women
and
he
had
not
found
a
reply
he
remembered
several
unpaid
debts
and
how
he
had
most
stupidly
run
through
two
very
respectable
fortunes
then
he
began
to
recall
facts
belonging
to
a
higher
order
he
remembered
that
he
had
once
insulted
a
poor
old
clerk
and
that
the
latter
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
cried
which
velchaninoff
had
thought
a
great
joke
at
the
time
but
now
looked
upon
in
quite
another
light
then
he
thought
how
he
had
once
merely
for
fun
set
a
scandal
going
about
the
beautiful
little
wife
of
a
certain
schoolmaster
and
how
the
husband
had
got
to
hear
the
rumour
he
velchaninoff
had
left
the
town
shortly
after
and
did
not
know
how
the
matter
had
ended
but
now
he
fell
to
wondering
and
picturing
to
himself
the
possible
consequences
of
his
action
and
goodness
knows
where
this
theme
would
not
have
taken
him
to
if
he
had
not
suddenly
recalled
another
picture
that
of
a
poor
girl
whom
he
had
been
ashamed
of
and
never
thought
of
loving
but
whom
he
had
betrayed
and
forsaken
her
and
her
child
when
he
left
petersburg
he
had
afterwards
searched
for
this
girl
and
her
baby
for
a
whole
year
but
never
found
them
of
this
sort
of
recollections
there
were
alas
but
too
many
and
each
one
seemed
to
bring
along
with
it
a
train
of
others
his
vanity
began
to
suffer
little
by
little
under
these
memories
i
have
said
that
his
vanity
had
developed
into
a
new
type
of
vanity
there
were
moments
few
albeit
in
which
he
was
not
even
ashamed
of
having
no
carriage
of
his
own
now
or
of
being
seen
by
one
of
his
former
friends
in
shabby
clothes
or
when
if
seen
and
looked
at
by
such
a
person
contemptuously
he
was
enough
to
suppress
even
a
frown
of
course
such
moments
of
were
rare
but
as
i
said
before
his
vanity
began
little
by
little
to
change
away
from
its
former
quarters
and
to
centre
upon
one
question
which
was
perpetually
ranging
itself
before
his
intellect
there
is
some
power
or
other
he
would
muse
sarcastically
somewhere
which
is
extremely
interested
in
my
morals
and
sends
me
these
damnable
recollections
and
tears
of
remorse
let
them
come
by
all
means
but
they
have
not
the
slightest
effect
on
me
for
i
haven
t
a
scrap
of
independence
about
me
in
spite
of
my
wretched
forty
years
i
know
that
for
certain
why
if
it
were
to
happen
so
that
i
should
gain
anything
by
spreading
another
scandal
about
that
schoolmaster
s
wife
for
instance
that
she
had
accepted
presents
from
me
or
something
of
that
sort
i
should
certainly
spread
it
without
a
but
though
no
other
opportunity
ever
did
occur
of
maligning
the
schoolmistress
yet
the
very
thought
alone
that
such
an
opportunity
were
to
occur
he
would
inevitably
seize
it
was
almost
fatal
to
him
at
times
he
was
not
tortured
with
memory
at
every
moment
of
his
life
he
had
intervals
of
time
to
breathe
and
rest
in
but
the
longer
he
stayed
the
more
unpleasant
did
he
find
his
life
in
petersburg
july
came
in
at
certain
moments
he
felt
inclined
to
throw
up
his
lawsuit
and
all
and
go
down
to
the
crimea
but
after
an
hour
or
so
he
would
despise
his
own
idea
and
laugh
at
himself
for
entertaining
it
these
thoughts
won
t
be
driven
away
by
a
mere
journey
down
south
he
said
to
himself
when
they
have
once
begun
to
annoy
me
besides
if
i
am
easy
in
my
conscience
now
i
surely
need
not
try
to
run
away
from
any
such
worrying
recollections
of
past
days
why
should
i
go
after
all
he
resumed
in
a
strain
of
melancholy
philosophizing
this
place
is
a
very
heaven
for
a
hypochondriac
like
myself
what
with
the
dust
and
the
heat
and
the
discomfort
of
this
house
what
with
the
nonsensical
swagger
and
pretence
of
all
these
wretched
little
civil
servants
in
the
departments
i
frequent
everyone
is
delightfully
candour
is
undoubtedly
worthy
of
all
respect
i
go
ll
stay
and
die
here
rather
than
go
chapter
ii
it
was
the
third
of
july
the
heat
and
closeness
of
the
air
had
become
quite
unbearable
the
day
had
been
a
busy
one
for
had
been
walking
and
driving
about
without
rest
and
had
still
in
prospect
a
visit
in
the
evening
to
a
certain
state
councillor
who
lived
somewhere
on
the
chornaya
riéchka
black
stream
and
whom
he
was
anxious
to
drop
in
upon
unexpectedly
at
six
o
clock
our
hero
issued
from
his
house
once
more
and
trudged
off
to
dine
at
a
restaurant
on
the
nefsky
near
the
sort
of
place
but
french
here
he
took
his
usual
corner
and
ordered
his
usual
dinner
and
waited
he
always
had
a
rouble
dinner
and
paid
for
his
wine
extra
which
moderation
he
looked
upon
as
a
discreet
sacrifice
to
the
temporary
financial
embarrassment
under
which
he
was
suffering
he
regularly
went
through
the
ceremony
of
wondering
how
he
could
bring
himself
to
eat
such
nastiness
and
yet
as
regularly
he
demolished
every
morsel
and
with
excellent
show
of
appetite
too
just
as
though
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
three
days
this
appetite
can
t
be
healthy
he
murmured
to
himself
sometimes
observing
his
own
voracity
however
on
this
particular
occasion
he
sat
down
to
his
dinner
in
a
miserably
bad
humour
he
threw
his
hat
angrily
away
somewhere
tipped
his
chair
back
reflected
he
was
in
the
sort
of
humour
that
if
his
next
at
the
little
table
near
to
rattle
his
plate
or
if
the
boy
serving
him
were
to
make
any
little
blunder
or
in
fact
if
any
little
petty
annoyance
were
to
put
him
out
of
a
sudden
he
was
quite
capable
of
shouting
at
the
offender
and
in
fact
of
kicking
up
a
serious
row
on
the
smallest
pretext
soup
was
served
to
him
he
took
up
his
spoon
and
was
about
to
commence
operations
when
he
suddenly
threw
it
down
again
and
started
from
his
seat
an
unexpected
thought
had
struck
him
and
in
an
instant
he
had
realized
why
he
had
been
plunged
in
gloom
and
mental
perturbation
during
the
last
few
days
goodness
knows
why
he
thus
suddenly
became
inspired
as
it
were
with
the
truth
but
so
it
was
he
jumped
from
his
chair
and
in
an
instant
it
all
stood
out
before
him
as
plain
as
his
five
fingers
it
s
all
that
hat
he
muttered
to
himself
it
s
all
simply
and
solely
that
damnable
round
hat
with
the
crape
band
round
it
that
s
the
reason
and
cause
of
all
my
worries
these
last
days
he
began
to
think
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
dejected
he
became
and
the
more
astonishing
appeared
the
remarkable
circumstance
of
the
but
hang
it
all
there
no
circumstance
he
growled
to
himself
what
circumstance
do
i
mean
there
s
been
nothing
in
the
nature
of
an
event
or
occurrence
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
this
nearly
a
fortnight
since
he
had
met
for
the
first
time
somewhere
about
the
corner
of
the
podiacheskaya
a
gentleman
with
crape
round
his
hat
there
was
nothing
particular
about
the
was
just
like
all
others
but
as
he
passed
velchaninoff
he
had
stared
at
him
so
fixedly
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
noticing
him
and
more
than
him
attentively
the
man
s
face
seemed
to
be
familiar
to
velchaninoff
he
had
evidently
seen
him
somewhere
and
at
some
time
or
other
but
one
sees
thousands
of
people
during
one
s
life
thought
velchaninoff
one
can
t
remember
every
face
so
he
had
gone
on
his
way
and
before
he
was
twenty
yards
further
to
all
appearances
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
meeting
in
spite
of
the
strength
of
the
first
impression
made
upon
him
and
yet
he
had
forgotten
for
the
impression
remained
all
day
and
a
very
original
impression
it
was
too
kind
of
objectless
feeling
of
anger
against
he
knew
not
what
he
remembered
his
exact
feelings
at
this
moment
a
fortnight
after
the
occurrence
how
he
had
been
puzzled
by
the
angry
nature
of
his
sentiments
at
the
time
and
puzzled
to
such
an
extent
that
he
had
never
for
a
moment
connected
his
with
the
meeting
of
the
morning
though
he
had
felt
as
cross
as
possible
all
day
but
the
gentleman
with
the
crape
band
had
not
lost
much
time
about
reminding
velchaninoff
of
his
existence
for
the
very
next
day
he
met
the
latter
again
on
the
nefsky
prospect
and
again
he
had
stared
in
a
peculiarly
fixed
way
at
him
velchaninoff
flared
up
and
spat
on
the
ground
in
like
but
a
moment
after
he
was
wondering
at
his
own
wrath
there
are
faces
undoubtedly
he
reflected
which
fill
one
with
disgust
at
first
sight
but
i
certainly
met
that
fellow
somewhere
or
other
yes
i
met
him
before
he
muttered
again
half
an
hour
later
and
again
as
on
the
last
occasion
he
was
in
a
vile
humour
all
that
evening
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
have
a
bad
dream
in
the
night
and
yet
it
never
entered
his
head
to
imagine
that
the
cause
of
his
bad
temper
on
both
occasions
had
been
the
accidental
meeting
with
the
gentleman
in
mourning
although
on
the
second
evening
he
had
remembered
and
thought
of
the
chance
encounter
two
or
three
times
he
had
even
flared
up
angrily
to
think
that
such
a
cad
should
presume
to
linger
in
his
memory
so
long
he
would
have
felt
it
humiliating
to
himself
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
such
a
wretched
creature
could
possibly
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
agitated
condition
of
his
feelings
two
days
later
the
pair
had
met
once
more
at
the
landing
place
of
one
of
the
small
neva
ferry
steamers
on
the
third
occasion
velchaninoff
was
ready
to
swear
that
the
man
recognised
him
and
had
pressed
through
the
crowd
towards
him
had
even
dared
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
call
him
by
name
as
to
this
last
fact
he
was
not
quite
certain
however
at
all
events
who
the
deuce
he
thought
velchaninoff
and
why
can
t
the
idiot
come
up
and
speak
to
me
if
he
really
does
recognise
me
and
if
he
so
much
wishes
to
do
so
with
these
thoughts
velchaninoff
had
taken
a
droshky
and
started
off
for
the
smolney
monastery
where
his
lawyer
lived
half
an
hour
later
he
was
engaged
in
his
usual
quarrel
with
that
gentleman
but
that
same
evening
he
was
in
a
worse
humour
than
ever
and
his
night
was
spent
in
fantastic
dreams
and
imaginings
which
were
anything
but
pleasant
i
suppose
it
s
bile
he
concluded
as
he
paid
his
matutinal
visit
to
the
this
was
the
third
meeting
then
for
five
days
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
man
and
yet
much
to
his
distaste
velchaninoff
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
avoid
thinking
of
the
man
with
the
crape
band
he
caught
himself
musing
over
the
fellow
what
have
i
to
do
with
him
he
thought
what
can
his
business
in
petersburg
be
looks
busy
and
whom
is
he
in
mourning
for
he
clearly
recognises
me
but
i
don
t
know
in
the
least
who
he
is
and
why
do
such
people
as
he
is
put
crape
on
their
hats
it
doesn
t
seem
the
thing
for
them
somehow
i
believe
i
shall
recognise
this
fellow
if
i
ever
get
a
good
close
look
at
him
and
there
came
over
him
that
sensation
we
all
know
so
same
feeling
that
one
has
when
one
can
t
for
the
life
of
one
think
of
the
required
word
every
other
word
comes
up
associations
with
the
right
word
come
up
occasions
when
one
has
used
the
word
come
up
one
wanders
round
and
round
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
word
wanted
but
the
actual
word
itself
will
not
appear
though
you
may
break
your
head
to
get
at
it
let
s
see
now
it
while
since
it
on
earth
was
it
there
was
devil
take
whatever
there
was
or
wasn
t
there
what
does
it
matter
to
me
he
broke
off
angrily
of
a
sudden
i
m
not
going
to
lower
myself
by
thinking
of
a
little
cad
like
that
he
felt
very
angry
but
when
in
the
evening
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
so
upset
and
recollected
the
cause
of
his
anger
he
felt
the
disagreeable
sensation
of
having
been
caught
by
someone
doing
something
wrong
this
fact
puzzled
and
annoyed
him
there
must
be
some
reason
for
my
getting
so
angry
at
the
mere
recollection
of
that
man
s
face
he
thought
but
he
didn
t
finish
thinking
it
out
but
the
next
evening
he
was
still
more
indignant
and
this
time
he
really
thought
with
good
cause
such
audacity
is
unparalleled
he
said
to
himself
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
had
been
a
fourth
meeting
with
the
man
of
the
crape
hat
band
the
latter
had
apparently
arisen
from
the
earth
and
confronted
him
but
let
me
explain
what
had
happened
it
so
chanced
that
velchaninoff
had
just
met
accidentally
that
very
mentioned
a
few
pages
back
whom
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
see
and
on
whom
he
had
intended
to
pounce
unexpectedly
at
his
country
house
this
gentleman
evidently
avoided
velchaninoff
but
at
the
same
time
was
most
necessary
to
the
latter
in
his
lawsuit
consequently
when
velchaninoff
met
him
the
one
was
delighted
while
the
other
was
very
much
the
reverse
velchaninoff
had
immediately
him
and
walked
down
the
street
with
him
talking
doing
his
very
utmost
to
keep
the
sly
old
fox
to
the
subject
on
which
it
was
so
necessary
that
he
should
be
pumped
and
it
was
just
at
this
most
important
moment
when
velchaninoff
s
intellect
was
all
on
the
to
catch
up
the
slightest
hints
of
what
he
wished
to
get
at
while
the
foxy
old
councillor
aware
of
the
fact
was
doing
his
best
to
reveal
nothing
that
the
former
taking
his
eyes
from
his
companion
s
face
for
one
instant
beheld
the
gentleman
of
the
crape
hatband
walking
along
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
looking
at
him
apparently
smiling
devil
take
him
said
velchaninoff
bursting
out
into
fury
at
once
while
the
old
fox
instantly
disappeared
and
i
should
have
succeeded
in
another
minute
curse
that
dirty
little
hound
he
s
simply
spying
me
i
ll
hire
somebody
ll
take
my
oath
he
laughed
at
me
him
i
ll
thrash
him
i
wish
i
had
a
stick
with
me
i
ll
buy
one
i
won
t
leave
this
matter
so
who
the
deuce
is
he
i
know
who
is
he
at
last
three
days
after
this
fourth
encounter
we
find
velchaninoff
sitting
down
to
dinner
at
his
restaurant
as
recorded
a
page
or
two
back
in
a
state
of
mind
bordering
upon
the
furious
he
could
not
conceal
the
state
of
his
feelings
from
himself
in
spite
of
all
his
pride
he
was
obliged
to
confess
at
last
that
all
his
anxiety
his
irritation
his
state
of
agitation
generally
must
undoubtedly
be
connected
with
and
absolutely
attributed
to
the
appearance
of
the
creature
with
the
crape
hatband
in
spite
of
his
insignificance
i
may
be
a
hypochondriac
he
reflected
and
i
may
be
inclined
to
make
an
elephant
out
of
a
gnat
but
how
does
it
help
me
what
use
is
it
to
me
if
i
persuade
myself
to
believe
that
all
this
is
fancy
why
if
every
dirty
little
wretch
like
that
is
to
have
the
power
of
upsetting
a
man
like
myself
s
simply
unbearable
undoubtedly
at
this
last
fifth
encounter
of
the
elephant
had
proved
himself
a
very
small
gnat
indeed
the
crape
man
had
appeared
suddenly
as
usual
and
had
passed
by
velchaninoff
but
without
looking
up
at
him
this
time
indeed
he
had
gone
by
with
downcast
eyes
and
had
even
seemed
anxious
to
pass
unobserved
velchaninoff
had
turned
rapidly
round
and
shouted
as
loud
as
ever
he
could
at
him
hey
he
cried
you
crape
hatband
you
want
to
escape
notice
this
time
do
you
who
are
you
both
the
question
and
the
whole
idea
of
calling
after
the
man
were
absurdly
foolish
and
velchaninoff
knew
it
the
moment
he
had
said
the
words
the
man
had
turned
round
stopped
for
an
instant
lost
his
head
made
up
his
mind
to
say
something
waited
half
a
minute
in
painful
indecision
then
twisted
suddenly
round
again
and
bolted
without
a
word
velchaninoff
gazed
after
him
in
amazement
what
if
it
be
that
haunt
and
not
he
me
after
all
he
thought
however
velchaninoff
ate
up
his
dinner
and
then
drove
off
to
pounce
upon
the
town
councillor
at
the
latter
s
house
if
he
could
the
councillor
was
not
in
and
he
was
informed
that
he
would
scarcely
be
at
home
before
three
or
four
in
the
morning
because
he
had
gone
to
a
name
velchaninoff
felt
that
this
was
too
bad
in
his
rage
he
determined
to
follow
and
hunt
the
fellow
up
at
the
party
he
actually
took
a
droshky
and
started
off
with
that
wild
idea
but
luckily
he
thought
better
of
it
on
the
way
got
out
of
the
vehicle
and
walked
away
towards
the
great
theatre
near
which
he
lived
he
felt
that
he
must
have
motion
also
he
absolutely
sleep
well
this
coming
night
in
order
to
sleep
he
must
be
tired
so
he
walked
all
the
way
fairly
long
walk
and
arrived
there
about
ten
as
tired
as
he
could
wish
his
lodging
which
he
had
taken
last
march
and
had
abused
ever
since
apologising
to
himself
for
living
in
such
a
hole
and
at
the
same
time
excusing
himself
for
the
fact
by
the
reflection
that
it
was
only
for
a
while
and
that
he
had
dropped
quite
accidentally
into
to
that
cursed
lawsuit
lodging
i
say
was
by
no
means
so
bad
as
he
made
it
out
to
be
the
entrance
certainly
was
a
little
dark
and
being
just
under
the
arch
of
the
gateway
but
he
had
two
fine
large
light
rooms
on
the
second
floor
separated
by
the
entrance
hall
one
of
these
rooms
overlooked
the
yard
and
the
other
the
street
leading
out
of
the
former
of
these
was
a
smaller
room
meant
to
be
used
as
a
bedroom
but
velchaninoff
had
filled
it
with
a
disordered
array
of
books
and
papers
and
preferred
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
large
rooms
the
one
overlooking
the
street
to
wit
his
bed
was
made
for
him
every
day
upon
the
large
divan
the
rooms
were
full
of
good
furniture
and
some
valuable
ornaments
and
pictures
were
scattered
about
but
the
whole
place
was
in
dreadful
disorder
the
fact
being
that
at
this
time
velchaninoff
was
without
a
regular
servant
his
one
domestic
had
gone
away
to
stay
with
her
friends
in
the
country
he
thought
of
taking
a
man
but
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
while
for
a
short
time
besides
he
hated
flunkeys
and
ended
by
making
arrangements
with
his
dvornik
s
sister
martha
who
was
to
come
up
every
morning
and
do
out
his
rooms
he
leaving
the
key
with
her
as
he
went
out
each
day
martha
did
absolutely
nothing
towards
tidying
the
place
and
robbed
him
besides
but
he
didn
t
care
he
liked
to
be
alone
in
the
house
but
solitude
is
all
very
well
within
certain
limits
and
velchaninoff
found
that
his
nerves
could
not
stand
all
this
sort
of
thing
at
certain
bilious
moments
and
it
so
fell
out
that
he
began
to
loathe
his
room
more
and
more
every
time
he
entered
it
however
on
this
particular
evening
he
hardly
gave
himself
time
to
undress
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
determined
that
nothing
should
make
him
think
of
and
that
he
would
fall
asleep
at
once
and
strangely
enough
his
head
had
hardly
touched
the
pillow
before
he
actually
was
asleep
and
this
was
the
first
time
for
a
month
past
that
such
a
thing
had
occurred
he
awoke
at
about
two
considerably
agitated
he
had
dreamed
certain
very
strange
dreams
reminding
him
of
the
incoherent
wanderings
of
fever
the
subject
seemed
to
be
some
crime
which
he
had
committed
and
concealed
but
of
which
he
was
accused
by
a
continuous
flow
of
people
who
swarmed
into
his
rooms
for
the
purpose
the
crowd
which
had
already
collected
within
was
enormous
and
yet
they
continued
to
pour
in
in
such
numbers
that
the
door
was
never
shut
for
an
instant
but
his
whole
interest
seemed
to
centre
in
one
strange
looking
individual
man
who
seemed
to
have
once
been
very
closely
and
intimately
connected
with
him
but
who
had
died
long
ago
and
now
reappeared
for
some
reason
or
other
the
most
tormenting
part
of
the
matter
was
that
velchaninoff
could
not
recollect
who
this
man
was
could
not
remember
his
name
he
recollected
the
fact
that
he
had
once
dearly
loved
him
all
the
rest
of
the
people
swarming
into
the
room
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
final
word
of
this
man
the
condemnation
or
the
justification
of
velchaninoff
was
to
be
pronounced
by
him
everyone
was
impatiently
waiting
to
hear
him
speak
but
he
sat
motionless
at
the
table
and
would
not
open
his
lips
to
say
a
word
of
any
sort
the
uproar
continued
the
general
annoyance
increased
and
suddenly
velchaninoff
himself
strode
up
to
the
man
in
a
fury
and
smote
him
because
he
would
not
speak
velchaninoff
felt
the
strangest
satisfaction
in
having
thus
smitten
him
his
heart
seemed
to
freeze
in
horror
for
what
he
had
done
and
in
acute
suffering
for
the
crime
involved
in
his
action
in
that
very
sensation
of
freezing
at
the
heart
lay
the
sense
of
satisfaction
which
he
felt
exasperated
more
and
more
he
struck
the
man
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
a
sort
of
intoxication
of
fury
and
terror
which
amounted
to
actual
insanity
and
yet
bore
within
it
a
germ
of
delightful
satisfaction
he
ceased
to
count
his
blows
and
rained
them
in
without
ceasing
he
felt
he
must
destroy
annihilate
demolish
all
this
suddenly
something
strange
happened
everyone
present
had
given
a
dreadful
cry
and
turned
expectantly
towards
the
door
while
at
the
same
moment
there
came
three
terrific
peals
of
the
so
violent
that
it
appeared
someone
was
anxious
to
pull
the
out
velchaninoff
awoke
started
up
in
a
second
and
made
for
the
door
he
was
persuaded
that
the
ring
at
the
bell
had
been
no
dream
or
illusion
but
that
someone
had
actually
rung
and
was
at
that
moment
standing
at
the
front
door
it
would
be
unnatural
if
such
a
clear
and
unmistakable
ring
should
turn
out
to
be
nothing
but
an
item
of
a
dream
he
thought
but
to
his
surprise
it
proved
that
such
was
nevertheless
the
actual
state
of
the
case
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
on
to
the
landing
he
looked
downstairs
and
about
him
but
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
the
bell
hung
motionless
surprised
but
pleased
he
returned
into
his
room
he
lit
a
candle
and
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
door
closed
but
not
locked
and
chained
he
had
often
returned
home
before
this
evening
and
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
behind
him
without
attaching
any
special
significance
to
the
fact
his
maid
had
often
respectfully
protested
against
such
neglect
while
with
him
he
now
returned
to
the
entrance
hall
to
make
the
door
fast
before
doing
so
he
opened
it
however
and
had
one
more
look
about
the
stairs
he
then
shut
the
door
and
fastened
the
chain
and
hook
but
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
some
clock
struck
two
at
this
moment
so
that
he
had
had
three
hours
or
less
his
dream
had
agitated
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
felt
unwilling
to
lie
down
again
at
once
he
decided
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
two
or
three
times
first
just
long
enough
to
smoke
a
cigar
having
himself
he
went
to
the
window
drew
the
heavy
curtains
aside
and
pulled
up
one
of
the
blinds
it
was
almost
full
daylight
these
light
summer
nights
of
petersburg
always
had
a
bad
effect
upon
his
nerves
and
of
late
they
had
added
to
the
causes
of
his
sleeplessness
so
that
a
few
weeks
since
he
had
invested
in
these
thick
curtains
which
completely
shut
out
the
light
when
drawn
close
having
thus
let
in
the
sunshine
quite
oblivious
of
the
lighted
candle
on
the
table
he
commenced
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
still
feeling
the
burden
of
his
dream
upon
him
its
impression
was
even
now
at
work
upon
his
mind
he
still
felt
a
painfully
guilty
sensation
about
him
caused
by
the
fact
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
raise
his
hand
against
that
man
and
strike
him
but
my
dear
sir
he
argued
with
himself
it
was
not
a
man
at
all
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
what
s
the
use
of
worrying
yourself
for
nothing
velchaninoff
now
became
obstinately
convinced
that
he
was
a
sick
man
and
that
to
his
sickly
state
of
body
was
to
be
attributed
all
his
perturbation
of
mind
he
was
an
invalid
it
had
always
been
a
weak
point
with
velchaninoff
that
he
hated
to
think
of
himself
as
growing
old
or
infirm
and
yet
in
his
moments
of
anger
he
loved
to
exaggerate
one
or
the
other
in
order
to
worry
himself
it
s
old
age
he
now
muttered
to
himself
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
i
m
becoming
an
old
s
the
fact
of
the
matter
i
m
losing
my
ghosts
and
have
dreams
and
hear
bells
it
all
i
know
these
dreams
of
old
they
always
herald
fever
with
me
i
dare
swear
that
the
whole
business
of
this
man
with
the
crape
hatband
has
been
a
dream
too
i
was
perfectly
right
yesterday
he
isn
t
haunting
me
the
least
bit
in
the
world
it
is
i
that
am
haunting
i
ve
invented
a
pretty
little
about
him
and
then
climb
under
the
table
in
terror
at
my
own
creation
why
do
i
call
him
a
little
cad
too
he
may
be
a
most
respectable
individual
for
all
i
know
his
face
is
a
disagreeable
one
certainly
though
there
is
nothing
hideous
about
it
he
dresses
just
like
anyone
else
i
don
t
s
something
about
his
i
go
again
what
the
devil
have
i
got
to
do
with
his
look
what
a
fool
i
as
though
i
could
not
live
without
the
dirty
little
him
among
other
thoughts
connected
with
this
haunting
was
one
which
puzzled
velchaninoff
immensely
he
felt
convinced
that
at
some
time
or
other
he
had
known
the
man
and
known
him
very
intimately
and
that
now
the
latter
when
meeting
him
always
laughed
at
him
because
he
was
aware
of
some
great
secret
of
his
former
life
or
because
he
was
amused
to
see
velchaninoff
s
present
humiliating
condition
of
poverty
mechanically
our
hero
approached
the
window
in
order
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
shuddering
feeling
came
over
him
that
something
unusual
and
was
happening
before
his
very
eyes
he
had
not
had
time
to
open
the
window
when
something
he
saw
caused
him
to
slip
behind
the
corner
of
the
curtain
and
hide
himself
the
man
in
the
crape
hatband
was
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
was
standing
with
his
face
turned
directly
towards
velchaninoff
s
window
but
evidently
unaware
of
the
latter
s
presence
there
and
was
carefully
examining
the
house
and
apparently
considering
some
question
connected
with
it
he
seemed
to
come
to
a
decision
after
a
moment
s
thought
and
raised
his
finger
to
his
forehead
then
he
looked
quietly
about
him
and
ran
swiftly
across
the
road
on
tiptoe
he
reached
the
gate
and
entered
it
this
gate
was
often
left
open
on
summer
nights
until
two
or
three
in
the
morning
he
s
coming
to
me
muttered
velchaninoff
and
with
equal
caution
he
left
the
window
and
ran
to
the
front
door
arrived
in
the
hall
he
stood
in
breathless
expectation
before
the
door
and
placed
his
trembling
hand
carefully
upon
the
hook
which
he
had
fastened
a
few
minutes
since
and
stood
listening
for
the
tread
of
the
expected
footfall
on
the
stairs
his
heart
was
beating
so
loud
that
he
was
afraid
he
might
miss
the
sound
of
the
cautious
steps
approaching
he
could
understand
nothing
of
what
was
happening
but
it
seemed
clear
that
his
dream
was
about
to
be
realised
velchaninoff
was
naturally
brave
he
loved
risk
for
its
own
sake
and
very
often
ran
into
useless
dangers
with
no
one
by
to
see
to
please
himself
but
this
was
different
somehow
he
was
not
himself
and
yet
he
was
as
brave
as
ever
but
with
something
added
he
made
out
every
movement
of
the
stranger
from
behind
his
own
door
ah
he
comes
s
on
the
steps
now
he
comes
s
up
now
he
s
looking
down
stairs
and
all
about
and
crouching
down
aha
there
s
his
hand
on
the
s
trying
it
thought
he
would
find
it
unlocked
he
must
know
that
i
leave
it
unlocked
sometimes
s
trying
it
again
suppose
he
thinks
the
hook
may
slip
doesn
t
care
to
go
away
without
doing
anything
so
ran
velchaninoff
s
thoughts
and
so
indeed
followed
the
man
s
actions
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
someone
was
certainly
standing
outside
and
trying
the
carefully
and
cautiously
pulling
at
the
door
itself
and
in
fact
endeavouring
to
effect
an
entrance
equally
sure
was
it
that
the
person
so
doing
must
have
his
own
object
in
trying
to
sneak
into
another
man
s
house
at
dead
of
night
but
velchaninoff
s
plan
of
action
was
laid
and
he
awaited
the
proper
moment
he
was
anxious
to
seize
a
good
the
hook
and
the
door
wide
suddenly
and
stand
face
to
face
with
this
bugbear
and
then
ask
him
what
the
deuce
he
wanted
there
no
sooner
devised
than
executed
awaiting
the
proper
moment
velchaninoff
suddenly
slipped
the
hook
pushed
the
door
wide
and
almost
tumbled
over
the
man
with
the
crape
hatband
chapter
iii
the
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
dumb
with
astonishment
both
men
stood
opposite
one
another
on
the
landing
and
both
stared
in
each
other
s
eyes
silent
and
motionless
so
passed
a
few
moments
and
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
lightning
velchaninoff
became
aware
of
the
identity
of
his
guest
at
the
same
moment
the
latter
seemed
to
guess
that
velchaninoff
had
recognised
him
velchaninoff
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
in
one
instant
the
visitor
s
whole
face
was
all
ablaze
with
its
very
sweetest
of
smiles
surely
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
aleksey
ivanovitch
he
asked
in
the
most
dulcet
of
voices
comically
inappropriate
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
surely
you
are
pavel
pavlovitch
trusotsky
asked
velchaninoff
in
return
after
a
pause
and
with
an
expression
of
much
perplexity
i
had
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
ten
years
ago
at
and
if
i
may
remind
you
of
the
fact
we
were
almost
intimate
quite
yes
but
it
is
now
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
you
have
been
trying
my
lock
for
the
last
ten
three
o
clock
cried
the
visitor
looking
at
his
watch
with
an
air
of
melancholy
surprise
why
so
it
is
dear
o
clock
forgive
me
aleksey
ivanovitch
i
ought
to
have
found
it
out
before
thinking
of
paying
you
a
visit
i
will
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
to
explain
another
day
and
now
oh
no
no
if
you
are
to
explain
at
all
let
s
have
it
at
once
this
moment
interrupted
velchaninoff
warmly
kindly
step
in
here
into
the
room
you
must
have
meant
to
come
in
you
know
you
didn
t
come
here
at
night
like
this
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
trying
my
lock
he
felt
excited
and
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
timidity
he
could
not
collect
his
thoughts
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
it
there
was
no
danger
no
mystery
about
the
business
nothing
but
the
silly
figure
of
pavel
pavlovitch
and
yet
he
could
not
feel
satisfied
that
there
was
nothing
particular
in
it
he
felt
afraid
of
something
to
come
he
knew
not
what
or
when
however
he
made
the
man
enter
seated
him
in
a
chair
and
himself
sat
down
on
the
side
of
his
bed
a
yard
or
so
off
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
while
he
quietly
waited
for
the
other
to
begin
he
felt
irritated
he
stared
at
his
visitor
and
let
his
thoughts
run
strangely
enough
the
other
never
opened
his
mouth
he
seemed
to
be
entirely
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
it
was
his
duty
to
speak
nay
he
was
even
looking
enquiringly
at
velchaninoff
as
though
quite
expecting
that
the
latter
would
speak
to
perhaps
he
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
at
first
somewhat
as
a
mouse
must
feel
when
he
finds
himself
unexpectedly
in
the
trap
velchaninoff
very
soon
lost
his
patience
well
he
cried
you
are
not
a
fantasy
or
a
dream
or
anything
of
that
kind
are
you
you
aren
t
a
corpse
are
you
come
my
friend
this
is
not
a
game
or
play
i
want
your
explanation
please
the
visitor
fidgeted
about
a
little
smiled
and
began
to
speak
cautiously
so
far
as
i
can
see
he
said
the
time
of
night
of
my
visit
is
what
surprises
you
and
that
i
should
have
come
as
i
did
in
fact
when
i
remember
the
past
and
our
intimacy
and
all
that
i
am
astonished
myself
but
the
fact
is
i
did
not
mean
to
come
in
at
all
and
if
i
did
so
it
was
purely
an
an
accident
why
i
saw
you
creeping
across
the
road
on
you
saw
me
indeed
come
then
you
know
as
much
or
more
about
the
matter
than
i
do
but
i
see
i
am
annoying
you
this
is
how
it
was
i
ve
been
in
town
three
weeks
or
so
on
business
i
am
pavel
pavlovitch
trusotsky
you
recognized
me
yourself
my
business
in
town
is
to
effect
an
exchange
of
departments
i
am
trying
for
a
situation
in
another
with
a
large
increase
of
salary
but
all
this
is
beside
the
point
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
believe
i
have
been
delaying
my
business
on
purpose
i
believe
if
everything
were
settled
at
this
moment
i
should
still
be
dawdling
in
this
petersburg
of
yours
in
my
present
condition
of
mind
i
go
wandering
about
as
though
i
had
lost
all
interest
in
things
and
were
rather
glad
of
the
fact
in
my
present
condition
of
what
condition
of
mind
asked
velchaninoff
frowning
the
visitor
raised
his
eyes
to
velchaninoff
s
lifted
his
hat
from
the
ground
beside
him
and
with
great
dignity
pointed
out
the
black
crape
band
there
sir
in
condition
of
mind
he
observed
velchaninoff
stared
stupidly
at
the
crape
and
thence
at
the
man
s
face
suddenly
his
face
flushed
up
in
a
hot
blush
for
a
moment
and
he
was
violently
agitated
not
natalia
vasilievna
surely
yes
natalia
vasilievna
last
march
consumption
sir
and
almost
over
in
two
or
three
here
am
i
left
as
you
see
me
so
saying
pavel
pavlovitch
with
much
show
of
feeling
bent
his
bald
head
down
and
kept
it
bent
for
some
ten
seconds
while
he
held
out
his
two
hands
in
one
of
which
was
the
hat
with
the
band
in
explanatory
emotion
this
gesture
and
the
man
s
whole
air
seemed
to
brighten
velchaninoff
up
he
smiled
sarcastically
for
one
instant
not
more
at
present
for
the
news
of
this
lady
s
death
he
had
known
her
so
long
ago
and
had
forgotten
her
many
a
year
since
had
made
a
quite
unexpected
impression
upon
his
mind
is
it
possible
he
muttered
using
the
first
words
that
came
to
his
lips
and
pray
why
did
you
not
come
here
and
tell
me
at
once
thanks
for
your
kind
interest
i
see
and
value
it
in
spite
in
spite
of
what
in
spite
of
so
many
years
of
separation
you
at
once
sympathised
with
my
in
fact
with
myself
and
so
fully
i
feel
naturally
grateful
that
s
all
i
had
to
tell
you
sir
don
t
suppose
i
doubt
my
friends
you
know
why
even
here
in
this
place
i
could
put
my
finger
on
several
very
sincere
friends
indeed
for
instance
stepan
michailovitch
bagantoff
but
remember
my
dear
aleksey
years
have
passed
since
we
were
friends
if
you
ll
allow
me
to
say
meanwhile
you
have
never
been
to
see
us
never
the
guest
sang
all
this
out
as
though
he
were
reading
it
from
music
but
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
the
while
although
of
course
he
saw
what
was
going
on
above
his
eyelashes
exceedingly
well
all
the
same
velchaninoff
had
found
his
head
by
this
time
with
a
strange
sort
of
fascinated
attention
which
strengthened
itself
every
moment
he
continued
to
gaze
at
and
listen
to
pavel
pavlovitch
and
of
a
sudden
when
the
latter
stopped
speaking
a
flood
of
curious
ideas
swept
unexpectedly
through
his
brain
but
look
here
he
cried
how
is
it
that
i
never
recognized
you
all
this
while
ve
met
five
times
at
least
in
the
streets
quite
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
circumstance
you
chanced
to
meet
me
two
or
three
times
no
no
met
you
i
you
velchaninoff
suddenly
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
rose
from
his
seat
pavel
pavlovitch
paused
a
moment
looked
keenly
at
velchaninoff
and
then
continued
as
to
your
not
recognizing
me
in
the
first
place
you
might
easily
have
forgotten
me
by
now
and
besides
i
have
had
since
last
we
met
and
i
daresay
my
face
is
a
good
deal
smallpox
why
how
did
you
manage
that
has
had
it
though
by
jove
cried
velchaninoff
what
a
funny
fellow
you
go
on
don
t
velchaninoff
s
spirits
were
rising
higher
and
higher
he
was
beginning
to
feel
wonderfully
that
feeling
of
agitation
which
had
lately
so
disturbed
him
had
given
place
to
quite
a
different
sentiment
he
now
began
to
stride
up
and
down
the
room
very
quickly
i
was
going
to
say
resumed
pavel
pavlovitch
that
though
i
have
met
you
several
times
and
though
i
quite
intended
to
come
and
look
you
up
when
i
was
arranging
my
visit
to
petersburg
still
i
was
in
that
condition
of
mind
you
know
and
my
wits
have
so
suffered
since
last
march
wits
since
last
march
go
on
wait
a
you
smoke
know
natalia
vasilievna
quite
so
but
since
might
a
cigarette
or
here
you
are
then
light
up
and
go
on
on
you
interest
me
velchaninoff
lit
a
cigar
and
sat
down
on
his
bed
again
pavel
pavlovitch
paused
a
moment
but
what
a
state
of
agitation
you
seem
to
be
in
yourself
said
he
are
you
quite
well
oh
curse
my
health
cried
velchaninoff
you
go
on
the
visitor
observed
his
host
s
agitation
with
satisfaction
he
went
on
with
his
share
of
the
talking
with
more
confidence
what
am
i
to
go
on
about
he
asked
imagine
me
alexey
broken
man
simply
broken
but
gone
at
the
root
as
it
were
a
man
forced
to
change
his
whole
manner
of
living
after
twenty
years
of
married
life
wandering
about
the
dusty
roads
without
an
object
oblivious
of
his
own
self
yet
as
it
were
taking
some
sort
of
intoxicated
delight
in
his
loneliness
isn
t
it
natural
that
if
i
should
at
such
a
moment
of
come
across
a
a
friend
i
might
prefer
to
avoid
him
for
that
moment
and
isn
t
it
equally
natural
that
at
another
moment
i
should
long
to
see
and
speak
with
some
one
who
has
been
an
of
or
a
partaker
so
to
speak
in
my
past
and
to
only
in
the
day
but
at
night
if
it
so
happens
rush
to
the
embrace
of
such
a
man
even
if
one
has
to
wake
him
up
at
three
in
the
morning
to
do
it
i
was
wrong
in
my
time
not
in
my
estimate
of
my
friend
though
for
at
this
moment
i
feel
the
full
rapture
of
success
my
rash
action
has
been
successful
i
have
found
sympathy
as
for
the
time
of
night
i
confess
i
thought
it
was
not
twelve
yet
you
see
one
sups
of
grief
and
it
intoxicates
one
least
not
grief
exactly
it
s
more
the
condition
of
new
state
of
things
that
affects
dear
me
how
oddly
you
express
yourself
said
velchaninoff
rising
from
his
seat
once
more
and
becoming
quite
serious
again
oddly
do
i
look
here
are
you
joking
joking
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
in
shocked
surprise
the
very
moment
when
i
am
telling
you
quiet
about
that
for
goodness
velchaninoff
started
off
on
his
journey
up
and
down
the
room
again
so
matters
stood
for
five
minutes
or
so
the
visitor
seemed
inclined
to
rise
from
his
chair
but
velchaninoff
bade
him
sit
still
and
pavel
pavlovitch
obediently
flopped
into
his
seat
again
how
changed
you
are
said
the
host
at
last
stopping
in
front
of
the
other
chair
as
though
suddenly
struck
with
the
idea
fearfully
changed
wonderful
you
re
quite
another
man
that
s
hardly
surprising
years
sir
no
no
no
years
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
s
not
in
appearance
you
are
so
changed
it
s
something
else
well
sir
the
nine
years
might
account
for
perhaps
it
s
only
since
march
eh
you
are
playful
sir
said
pavel
pavlovitch
laughing
slyly
but
if
i
may
ask
it
wherein
am
i
so
changed
you
used
to
be
such
a
staid
sober
correct
pavel
pavlovitch
such
a
wise
pavel
pavlovitch
and
now
you
re
a
sort
of
pavel
velchaninoff
was
in
that
state
of
irritation
when
the
steadiest
gravest
people
will
sometimes
say
rather
more
than
they
mean
am
i
and
no
longer
i
suppose
eh
chuckled
pavel
pavlovitch
with
disagreeable
satisfaction
wise
indeed
my
dear
sir
i
m
afraid
you
are
not
sober
replied
velchaninoff
and
added
to
himself
i
am
pretty
fairly
insolent
myself
but
i
can
t
compare
with
this
little
cad
and
what
on
earth
is
the
fellow
driving
at
oh
my
dear
good
my
best
of
alexey
ivanovitches
said
the
visitor
suddenly
most
excitedly
and
twisting
about
on
his
chair
and
why
i
be
sober
we
are
not
moving
in
the
brilliant
walks
of
and
now
we
are
but
two
dear
old
friends
come
together
in
the
full
sincerity
of
perfect
love
to
recall
and
talk
over
that
sweet
mutual
tie
of
which
the
dear
departed
formed
so
treasured
a
link
in
our
so
saying
the
sensitive
gentleman
became
so
carried
away
by
his
feelings
that
he
bent
his
head
down
once
more
to
hide
his
emotion
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hat
velchaninoff
looked
on
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
disgust
i
can
t
help
thinking
the
man
is
simply
silly
he
thought
and
face
is
so
red
he
must
be
drunk
but
drunk
or
not
drunk
what
does
the
little
wretch
want
with
me
that
s
the
do
you
you
delightful
little
sometimes
or
sometimes
simeon
simeonovitch
s
continued
the
visitor
gradually
removing
his
hat
from
before
his
face
and
apparently
growing
more
and
more
enthusiastic
over
the
memories
of
the
past
and
our
little
and
she
and
our
first
meeting
when
you
came
in
to
ask
for
information
about
something
connected
with
your
business
in
the
town
and
commenced
shouting
angrily
at
me
don
t
you
suddenly
in
came
natalia
vasilievna
and
within
ten
minutes
you
were
our
dear
friend
and
so
remained
for
exactly
a
year
just
like
turgenieff
s
story
the
provincialka
velchaninoff
had
continued
his
walk
up
and
down
the
room
during
this
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
listening
impatiently
and
with
listening
all
the
same
it
never
struck
me
to
think
of
the
provincialka
in
connection
with
the
matter
he
interrupted
and
look
here
why
do
you
talk
in
that
sneaking
whining
sort
of
voice
you
never
used
to
do
that
your
whole
manner
is
unlike
quite
so
quite
so
i
used
to
be
more
silent
i
know
i
used
to
love
to
listen
while
others
talked
you
remember
how
well
the
dear
departed
wit
and
grace
of
her
conversation
as
to
the
provincialka
i
remember
she
and
i
used
often
to
compare
your
friendship
for
us
to
certain
episodes
in
that
piece
and
especially
to
the
doings
of
one
stupendief
it
really
was
remarkably
like
that
character
and
his
what
stupendief
do
you
mean
confound
it
all
cried
velchaninoff
stamping
his
foot
with
rage
the
name
seemed
to
have
evoked
certain
most
irritating
thoughts
in
his
mind
why
stupendief
don
t
you
know
the
husband
in
provincialka
whined
pavel
pavlovitch
in
the
very
sweetest
of
tones
but
that
belongs
to
another
set
of
fond
you
departed
in
fact
when
bagantoff
had
honoured
us
with
his
friendship
just
as
you
had
done
before
him
only
that
his
lasted
five
whole
bagantoff
what
bagantoff
do
you
mean
that
same
bagantoff
who
was
serving
down
in
your
town
why
he
yes
yes
quite
so
he
also
he
also
cried
the
enthusiastic
pavel
pavlovitch
seizing
upon
velchaninoff
s
accidental
slip
of
course
so
that
there
you
s
the
whole
company
bagantoff
played
the
count
the
dear
departed
was
the
provincialka
and
i
was
the
husband
only
that
the
part
was
taken
away
from
me
for
incapacity
i
suppose
yes
fancy
a
stupendief
you
re
re
first
a
pavel
pavlovitch
trusotsky
said
velchaninoff
contemptuously
and
very
unceremoniously
but
look
here
bagantoff
is
in
town
i
know
he
is
for
i
have
seen
him
why
don
t
you
go
to
see
as
well
as
myself
my
dear
sir
i
ve
been
there
every
day
for
the
last
three
weeks
he
won
t
receive
me
he
s
ill
and
can
t
receive
and
do
you
know
i
have
found
out
that
he
really
is
very
ill
fancy
my
s
friend
oh
my
dear
alexey
ivanovitch
you
don
t
know
what
my
feelings
are
in
my
present
condition
of
mind
i
assure
you
at
one
moment
i
long
for
the
earth
to
open
and
swallow
me
up
and
the
next
i
feel
that
i
find
one
of
those
old
friends
eyewitnesses
of
the
past
as
it
were
if
only
to
weep
on
his
bosom
only
to
weep
you
my
well
that
s
about
enough
for
don
t
you
think
so
said
velchaninoff
cuttingly
oh
much
cried
the
other
rising
it
must
be
four
o
clock
and
here
am
i
agitating
your
feelings
in
the
most
selfish
now
look
here
i
shall
call
upon
you
myself
and
i
hope
that
you
will
tell
me
honestly
are
you
drunk
drunk
not
the
least
in
the
world
did
you
drink
nothing
before
you
came
here
or
earlier
do
you
know
my
dear
alexey
ivanovitch
you
are
quite
in
a
high
fever
i
shall
call
and
i
have
noticed
it
all
the
evening
really
quite
delirious
continued
pavel
pavlovitch
licking
his
lips
as
it
were
with
satisfaction
as
he
pursued
this
theme
i
am
really
quite
ashamed
that
i
should
have
allowed
myself
to
be
so
awkward
as
to
agitate
you
well
well
i
m
going
now
you
must
lie
down
at
once
and
go
to
you
haven
t
told
me
where
you
live
shouted
velchaninoff
after
him
as
he
left
the
room
oh
didn
t
i
pokrofsky
pavel
pavlovitch
was
out
on
the
stairs
now
stop
cried
velchaninoff
once
more
you
are
not
running
away
are
you
how
do
you
mean
running
away
asked
pavel
pavlovitch
turning
round
at
the
third
step
and
grinning
back
at
him
with
his
eyes
staring
very
wide
open
instead
of
replying
velchaninoff
banged
the
door
fiercely
locked
and
bolted
it
and
went
fuming
back
into
his
room
arrived
there
he
spat
on
the
ground
as
though
to
get
rid
of
the
taste
of
something
loathsome
he
then
stood
motionless
for
at
least
five
minutes
in
the
centre
of
the
room
after
which
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
fell
asleep
in
an
instant
the
forgotten
candle
burned
itself
out
in
its
socket
chapter
iv
velchaninoff
slept
soundly
until
nine
at
which
hour
he
started
up
sat
down
on
the
side
of
his
bed
and
began
to
think
his
thoughts
quickly
fixed
themselves
upon
the
death
of
that
the
agitating
impression
wrought
upon
his
mind
by
yesterday
s
news
as
to
her
death
had
left
a
painful
feeling
of
mental
perturbation
this
morning
the
whole
of
the
events
of
nine
years
back
stood
out
before
his
mind
s
eye
with
extraordinary
distinctness
he
had
loved
this
woman
natalia
s
wife
had
loved
her
and
had
acted
the
part
of
her
lover
during
the
time
which
he
had
spent
in
their
provincial
town
while
engaged
in
business
connected
with
a
legacy
he
had
lived
there
a
whole
year
though
his
business
did
not
require
by
any
means
so
long
a
visit
in
fact
the
tie
above
mentioned
had
detained
him
in
the
place
he
had
been
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
this
passion
that
natalia
vasilievna
had
held
him
in
a
species
of
slavery
he
would
have
obeyed
the
slightest
whim
or
the
wildest
caprice
of
the
woman
at
that
time
he
had
never
before
or
since
experienced
anything
approaching
to
the
infatuation
she
had
caused
when
the
time
came
for
departing
velchaninoff
had
been
in
a
state
of
such
absolute
despair
though
the
parting
was
to
have
been
but
a
short
one
that
he
had
begged
natalia
vasilievna
to
leave
all
and
fly
across
the
frontier
with
him
and
it
was
only
by
laughing
him
out
of
the
idea
though
she
had
at
first
encouraged
it
herself
probably
for
a
joke
and
by
unmercifully
chaffing
him
that
the
lady
eventually
persuaded
velchaninoff
to
depart
alone
however
he
had
not
been
a
couple
of
months
in
petersburg
before
he
found
himself
asking
himself
that
question
which
he
had
never
to
this
day
been
able
to
answer
satisfactorily
namely
he
love
this
woman
at
all
or
was
it
nothing
but
the
infatuation
of
the
moment
he
did
not
ask
this
question
because
he
was
conscious
of
any
new
passion
taking
root
in
his
heart
on
the
contrary
during
those
first
two
months
in
town
he
had
been
in
that
condition
of
mind
that
he
had
not
so
much
as
looked
at
a
woman
though
he
had
met
hundreds
and
had
returned
to
his
old
society
ways
at
once
and
yet
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
if
he
were
to
return
to
he
would
instantly
fall
into
the
meshes
of
his
passion
for
natalia
vasilievna
once
more
in
spite
of
the
question
which
he
could
not
answer
as
to
the
reality
of
his
love
for
her
five
years
later
he
was
as
convinced
of
this
fact
as
ever
although
the
very
thought
of
it
was
detestable
to
him
and
although
he
did
not
remember
the
name
of
natalia
vasilievna
but
with
loathing
he
was
ashamed
of
that
episode
at
he
could
not
understand
how
he
velchaninoff
could
ever
have
allowed
himself
to
become
the
victim
of
such
a
stupid
passion
he
blushed
whenever
he
thought
of
the
shameful
and
even
wept
for
shame
he
managed
to
forget
his
remorse
after
a
few
more
felt
sure
that
he
had
lived
it
down
and
yet
now
after
nine
years
here
was
the
whole
thing
resuscitated
by
the
news
of
natalia
s
death
at
all
events
however
now
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
with
agitating
thoughts
swarming
through
his
brain
he
could
not
but
feel
that
the
fact
of
her
being
dead
was
a
consolation
amidst
all
the
painful
reflections
which
the
mention
of
her
name
had
called
up
surely
i
am
a
little
sorry
for
her
he
asked
himself
well
he
certainly
did
not
feel
that
sensation
of
hatred
for
her
now
he
could
think
of
her
and
judge
her
now
without
passion
of
any
kind
and
therefore
more
justly
he
had
long
since
been
of
opinion
that
in
all
probability
there
had
been
nothing
more
in
natalia
vasilievna
than
is
to
be
found
in
every
lady
of
good
provincial
society
and
that
he
himself
had
created
the
whole
fantasy
of
his
worship
and
her
worshipfulness
but
though
he
had
formed
this
opinion
he
always
doubted
its
correctness
and
he
still
felt
that
doubt
now
facts
existed
to
contradict
the
theory
for
instance
this
bagantoff
had
lived
for
several
years
at
and
had
been
no
less
a
victim
to
passion
for
this
woman
and
had
been
as
helpless
as
velchaninoff
himself
under
her
witchery
bagantoff
though
a
young
idiot
as
velchaninoff
expressed
it
was
nevertheless
a
scion
of
the
very
highest
society
in
petersburg
his
career
was
in
petersburg
and
it
was
significant
that
such
a
man
should
have
wasted
five
important
years
of
his
life
at
simply
out
of
love
for
this
woman
it
was
said
that
he
had
only
returned
to
petersburg
even
then
because
the
lady
had
had
enough
of
him
so
that
all
things
considered
there
must
have
been
something
which
rendered
natalia
vasilievna
preeminently
attractive
among
women
yet
the
woman
was
not
rich
she
was
not
even
pretty
if
not
absolutely
velchaninoff
had
known
her
when
she
was
years
old
her
face
was
capable
of
taking
a
pleasing
expression
but
her
eyes
were
not
were
too
hard
she
was
a
thin
bony
woman
to
look
at
her
mind
was
intelligent
but
narrow
and
she
had
tact
and
taste
especially
as
to
dress
her
character
was
firm
and
overbearing
she
was
never
wrong
in
her
own
opinion
or
unjust
the
unfaithfulness
towards
her
husband
never
caused
her
the
slightest
remorse
she
hated
corruption
and
yet
she
was
herself
corrupt
and
she
believed
in
herself
absolutely
nothing
could
ever
have
persuaded
her
that
she
herself
was
actually
depraved
velchaninoff
believed
that
she
really
did
not
know
that
her
own
corruption
was
corrupt
he
considered
her
to
be
one
of
those
women
who
only
exist
to
be
unfaithful
such
women
never
remain
unmarried
is
the
law
of
their
nature
to
marry
husband
is
their
first
lover
and
he
is
always
to
blame
for
anything
that
may
happen
afterwards
the
unfaithful
wife
herself
being
invariably
in
the
right
and
of
course
perfectly
innocent
so
thought
velchaninoff
and
he
was
convinced
that
such
a
type
of
woman
actually
existed
but
he
was
no
less
convinced
that
there
also
existed
a
corresponding
type
of
men
born
to
be
the
husbands
of
such
women
in
his
opinion
the
mission
of
such
men
was
to
be
so
to
speak
permanent
husbands
is
to
be
husbands
all
their
lives
and
nothing
else
velchaninoff
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
these
two
types
and
pavel
pavlovitch
trusotsky
was
in
his
opinion
an
excellent
representative
of
the
male
type
of
course
the
pavel
pavlovitch
of
last
night
was
by
no
means
the
same
pavel
pavlovitch
as
he
had
known
at
he
had
found
an
extraordinary
change
in
the
man
and
yet
on
reflection
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
the
change
was
but
natural
for
that
he
could
only
have
remained
what
he
was
so
long
as
his
wife
lived
and
that
now
he
was
but
a
part
of
a
whole
allowed
to
wander
at
is
an
imperfect
being
a
surprising
an
incomprehensible
sort
of
a
without
proper
balance
as
for
the
pavel
pavlovitch
of
this
is
what
velchaninoff
remembered
of
him
pavel
pavlovitch
had
been
a
husband
of
course
formality
that
was
all
if
for
instance
he
was
a
clerk
of
department
besides
he
was
so
merely
in
his
capacity
of
and
as
a
part
of
his
responsibility
husband
he
worked
for
his
wife
and
for
her
social
position
he
had
been
years
old
at
that
time
and
was
possessed
of
some
considerable
property
he
had
not
shown
any
special
talent
nor
on
the
other
hand
any
marked
incapacity
in
his
professional
employment
his
position
had
been
decidedly
a
good
one
natalia
vasilievna
had
been
respected
and
looked
up
to
by
all
not
that
she
valued
their
respect
in
the
least
considered
it
merely
as
her
due
she
was
a
good
hostess
and
had
schooled
pavel
pavlovitch
into
polite
manners
so
that
he
was
able
to
receive
and
entertain
the
very
best
society
passably
well
he
might
be
a
clever
man
for
all
velchaninoff
knew
but
as
natalia
vasilievna
did
not
like
her
husband
to
talk
much
there
was
little
opportunity
of
judging
he
may
have
had
many
good
qualities
as
well
as
bad
but
the
good
ones
were
so
to
speak
kept
put
away
in
their
cases
and
the
bad
ones
were
stifled
and
not
allowed
to
appear
velchaninoff
remembered
for
instance
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
once
or
twice
shown
a
disposition
to
laugh
at
those
about
him
but
this
unworthy
proclivity
had
been
very
promptly
subdued
he
had
been
fond
of
telling
stories
but
this
was
not
allowed
either
or
if
permitted
at
all
the
anecdote
was
to
be
of
the
shortest
and
most
uninteresting
description
pavel
pavlovitch
had
a
circle
of
private
friends
outside
the
house
with
whom
he
was
fain
at
times
to
taste
the
flowing
bowl
but
this
vicious
tendency
was
radically
stamped
out
as
soon
as
possible
and
yet
with
all
this
natalia
vasilievna
appeared
to
the
uninitiated
to
be
the
most
obedient
of
wives
and
doubtless
considered
herself
so
pavel
pavlovitch
may
have
been
desperately
in
love
with
her
one
could
say
as
to
this
velchaninoff
had
frequently
asked
himself
during
his
life
at
whether
pavel
pavlovitch
ever
suspected
his
wife
of
having
formed
the
tie
with
himself
of
which
mention
has
been
made
velchaninoff
had
several
times
questioned
natalia
vasilievna
on
this
point
seriously
enough
but
had
invariably
been
told
with
some
show
of
annoyance
that
her
husband
neither
did
know
nor
ever
could
know
and
that
all
there
might
be
to
know
was
not
his
business
another
trait
in
her
character
was
that
she
never
laughed
at
pavel
pavlovitch
and
never
found
him
funny
in
any
sense
and
that
she
would
have
been
down
on
any
person
who
dared
to
be
rude
to
him
at
once
pavel
pavlovitch
s
reference
to
the
pleasant
little
readings
enjoyed
by
the
trio
nine
years
ago
was
accurate
they
used
to
read
dickens
novels
together
velchaninoff
or
trusotsky
reading
aloud
while
natalia
vasilievna
worked
the
life
at
had
ended
suddenly
and
so
far
as
velchaninoff
was
concerned
in
a
way
which
drove
him
almost
to
the
verge
of
madness
the
fact
is
he
was
simply
turned
it
was
all
managed
in
such
a
way
that
he
never
observed
that
he
was
being
thrown
over
like
an
old
shoe
a
young
artillery
officer
had
appeared
in
the
town
a
month
or
so
before
velchaninoff
s
departure
and
had
made
acquaintance
with
the
trusotsky
s
the
trio
became
a
quartet
before
long
velchaninoff
was
informed
that
for
many
reasons
a
separation
was
absolutely
necessary
natalia
vasilievna
adduced
a
hundred
excellent
reasons
why
this
had
become
especially
one
which
quite
settled
the
matter
after
his
stormy
attempt
to
persuade
natalia
vasilievna
to
fly
with
him
to
anywhere
had
ended
by
going
to
petersburg
two
or
three
months
at
the
as
he
said
he
would
refuse
to
go
at
all
in
spite
of
every
reason
and
argument
natalia
might
adduce
exactly
two
months
later
velchaninoff
had
received
a
letter
from
natalia
vasilievna
begging
him
to
come
no
more
to
because
that
she
already
loved
another
as
to
the
principal
reason
which
she
had
brought
forward
in
favour
of
his
immediate
departure
she
now
informed
him
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
velchaninoff
remembered
the
young
artilleryman
and
understood
so
the
matter
had
ended
once
and
for
all
a
year
or
two
after
this
bagantoff
appeared
at
and
an
intimacy
between
natalia
vasilievna
and
the
former
had
sprung
up
which
lasted
for
five
years
this
long
period
of
constancy
velchaninoff
attributed
to
advancing
age
on
the
part
of
natalia
he
sat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
for
nearly
an
hour
and
thought
at
last
he
roused
himself
rang
for
mavra
and
his
coffee
drank
it
off
punctually
at
eleven
was
on
his
way
to
the
pokrofsky
hotel
he
felt
rather
ashamed
of
his
behaviour
to
pavel
pavlovitch
last
night
velchaninoff
put
down
all
that
phantasmagoria
of
the
trying
of
the
lock
and
so
on
to
pavel
pavlovitch
s
drunken
condition
and
to
other
reasons
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
make
fresh
relations
with
the
husband
of
that
woman
since
their
acquaintanceship
and
intercourse
had
come
to
so
natural
and
simple
a
termination
yet
something
seemed
to
draw
him
strong
current
of
impulse
he
went
chapter
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
thinking
of
running
away
and
goodness
knows
why
velchaninoff
should
have
asked
him
such
a
question
last
did
not
know
himself
why
he
had
said
it
he
was
directed
to
the
petrofsky
hotel
and
found
the
building
at
once
at
the
hotel
he
was
told
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
now
engaged
a
furnished
lodging
in
the
back
part
of
the
same
house
mounting
the
dirty
and
narrow
stairs
indicated
as
far
as
the
third
storey
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
someone
crying
it
sounded
like
the
weeping
of
a
child
of
some
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
it
was
a
bitter
but
a
more
or
less
suppressed
sort
of
crying
and
with
it
came
the
sound
of
a
grown
man
s
voice
apparently
trying
to
quiet
the
that
its
sobbing
and
crying
should
not
be
heard
yet
only
succeeding
in
making
it
cry
the
louder
the
man
s
voice
did
not
seem
in
any
way
sympathetic
with
the
child
s
grief
and
the
latter
appeared
to
be
begging
for
forgiveness
making
his
way
into
a
narrow
dark
passage
with
two
doors
on
each
side
of
it
velchaninoff
met
a
elderly
woman
in
very
careless
morning
attire
and
inquired
for
pavel
pavlovitch
she
tapped
the
door
with
her
fingers
in
response
to
his
same
door
apparently
whence
issued
the
noises
just
mentioned
her
fat
face
seemed
to
flush
with
indignation
as
she
did
so
he
appears
to
be
amusing
himself
in
there
she
said
and
proceeded
downstairs
velchaninoff
was
about
to
knock
but
thought
better
of
it
and
opened
the
door
without
ceremony
in
the
very
middle
of
a
room
furnished
with
plain
but
abundant
furniture
stood
pavel
pavlovitch
in
his
very
red
in
the
face
trying
to
persuade
a
little
girl
to
do
something
or
other
and
using
cries
and
gestures
and
what
looked
to
velchaninoff
very
like
kicks
in
order
to
effect
his
purpose
the
child
appeared
to
be
some
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
and
was
poorly
dressed
in
a
short
black
stuff
frock
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
most
hysterical
condition
crying
and
stretching
out
her
arms
to
pavel
pavlovitch
as
though
begging
and
entreating
him
to
allow
her
to
do
whatever
it
might
be
she
desired
on
velchaninoff
s
appearance
the
scene
changed
in
an
instant
no
sooner
did
her
eyes
fall
on
the
visitor
than
the
child
made
for
the
door
of
the
next
room
with
a
cry
of
alarm
while
pavel
out
for
one
little
relaxed
into
smiles
of
great
as
he
had
done
last
night
when
velchaninoff
suddenly
opened
his
front
door
and
caught
him
standing
outside
alexey
ivanovitch
he
cried
in
real
surprise
who
ever
would
have
thought
it
sit
the
this
chair
down
my
dear
sir
i
ll
just
put
and
he
rushed
for
his
coat
and
threw
it
on
leaving
his
waistcoat
behind
don
t
stand
on
ceremony
with
me
said
velchaninoff
sitting
down
stay
as
you
are
no
sir
no
excuse
insist
upon
standing
on
ceremony
there
now
i
m
a
little
more
respectable
dear
me
now
who
ever
would
have
thought
of
seeing
here
i
for
one
pavel
pavlovitch
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
which
he
turned
so
as
to
face
velchaninoff
and
pray
shouldn
t
you
have
expected
me
i
told
you
last
night
that
i
was
coming
this
morning
i
thought
you
wouldn
t
come
did
indeed
in
fact
when
i
thought
over
yesterday
s
visit
i
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again
i
did
indeed
sir
velchaninoff
glanced
round
the
room
meanwhile
the
place
was
very
untidy
the
bed
was
unmade
the
clothes
thrown
about
the
floor
on
the
table
were
two
coffee
tumblers
with
the
dregs
of
coffee
still
in
them
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
half
finished
and
with
a
tumbler
standing
alongside
it
he
glanced
at
the
next
room
but
all
was
quiet
there
the
little
girl
had
hidden
herself
and
was
as
still
as
a
mouse
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
drink
that
stuff
at
this
time
of
day
he
asked
indicating
the
champagne
bottle
it
s
only
a
remnant
explained
pavel
pavlovitch
a
little
confused
my
word
you
a
changed
man
bad
habits
sir
and
all
of
a
sudden
all
dating
from
that
time
sir
give
you
my
word
i
couldn
t
resist
it
but
i
m
all
right
m
not
shan
t
talk
twaddle
as
i
did
last
night
don
t
be
afraid
sir
it
s
all
right
from
that
very
day
sir
give
you
my
word
it
is
and
if
anyone
had
told
me
half
a
year
ago
that
i
should
become
like
this
they
had
shown
me
my
face
in
a
glass
then
as
i
should
be
i
should
have
given
them
the
lie
sir
i
should
indeed
hem
then
you
drunk
last
night
was
admitted
pavel
pavlovitch
a
little
not
exactly
a
little
drunk
tell
you
this
by
way
of
explanation
because
i
m
always
worse
being
drunk
if
i
m
only
a
little
drunk
still
the
violence
and
unreasonableness
of
intoxication
come
out
afterwards
and
stay
out
too
and
then
i
feel
my
grief
the
more
keenly
i
daresay
my
grief
is
responsible
for
my
drinking
i
am
capable
of
making
an
awful
fool
of
myself
and
offending
people
when
i
m
drunk
i
daresay
i
seemed
strange
enough
to
you
last
night
don
t
you
remember
what
you
said
and
did
assuredly
i
remember
everything
listen
to
me
pavel
pavlovitch
i
have
thought
it
over
and
have
come
to
very
much
the
same
conclusion
as
you
did
yourself
began
velchaninoff
gently
believe
i
was
a
little
too
irritable
towards
you
last
impatient
admit
it
gladly
the
fact
am
not
very
well
sometimes
and
your
sudden
arrival
you
know
in
the
middle
of
the
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
are
quite
was
said
pavel
pavlovitch
wagging
his
head
assentingly
how
in
the
world
could
i
have
brought
myself
to
do
such
a
thing
i
shouldn
t
have
come
in
though
if
you
hadn
t
opened
the
door
i
should
have
gone
as
i
came
i
called
on
you
about
a
week
ago
and
did
not
find
you
at
home
and
i
daresay
i
should
never
have
called
again
for
i
am
rather
spite
of
my
present
state
whenever
i
have
met
you
in
the
streets
i
have
always
said
to
myself
what
if
he
doesn
t
know
me
and
rejects
years
is
no
joke
and
i
did
not
dare
try
you
for
fear
of
being
snubbed
yesterday
thanks
to
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
he
pointed
to
the
bottle
i
didn
t
know
what
time
it
was
s
lucky
you
are
the
kind
of
man
you
are
alexey
ivanovitch
or
i
should
despair
of
preserving
your
acquaintance
after
yesterday
you
remember
old
times
alexey
ivanovitch
velchaninoff
listened
keenly
to
all
this
the
man
seemed
to
be
talking
seriously
enough
and
even
with
some
dignity
and
yet
he
had
not
believed
a
single
word
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
uttered
from
the
very
first
moment
that
he
entered
the
room
tell
me
pavel
pavlovitch
said
velchaninoff
at
last
see
you
are
not
quite
alone
here
little
girl
is
that
i
saw
when
i
came
in
pavel
pavlovitch
looked
surprised
and
raised
his
eyebrow
but
he
gazed
back
at
velchaninoff
with
candour
and
apparent
amiability
whose
little
girl
why
that
s
our
liza
he
said
smiling
affably
what
liza
asked
velchaninoff
something
seemed
to
cause
him
to
shudder
inwardly
the
sensation
was
dreadfully
sudden
just
now
on
entering
the
room
and
seeing
liza
he
had
felt
surprised
more
or
less
had
not
been
conscious
of
the
slightest
feeling
of
presentiment
he
had
had
no
special
thought
about
the
matter
at
the
moment
liza
daughter
liza
repeated
pavel
pavlovitch
smiling
your
daughter
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
and
natalia
vasilievna
had
children
asked
velchaninoff
timidly
and
in
a
very
low
tone
of
voice
indeed
of
a
fool
i
in
the
world
should
know
providence
sent
us
the
gift
after
you
had
gone
pavel
pavlovitch
jumped
off
his
chair
in
apparently
pleasurable
excitement
i
heard
nothing
of
it
said
velchaninoff
looking
very
pale
how
should
you
how
should
you
repeated
pavel
pavlovitch
with
ineffable
sweetness
we
had
quite
lost
hope
of
any
you
may
remember
suddenly
heaven
sent
us
this
little
one
and
oh
my
alone
knows
what
i
felt
just
a
year
after
you
went
i
wait
a
a
year
by
a
long
way
s
see
you
left
us
in
october
or
november
didn
t
you
i
left
on
the
twelfth
of
september
i
remember
hum
september
was
it
dear
me
well
then
let
s
october
november
december
january
february
march
the
of
was
liza
s
months
all
but
a
bit
and
if
you
could
only
have
seen
the
dear
departed
how
show
her
to
her
in
the
words
seemed
to
tear
themselves
from
velchaninoff
whether
he
liked
it
or
no
moment
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
forgetting
that
he
had
not
finished
his
previous
sentence
or
ignoring
the
fact
and
he
hastily
left
the
room
and
entered
the
small
chamber
adjoining
three
or
four
minutes
passed
by
while
velchaninoff
heard
the
rapid
interchange
of
whispers
going
on
and
an
occasional
rather
louder
sound
of
liza
s
voice
apparently
entreating
her
father
to
leave
her
velchaninoff
concluded
at
last
the
two
came
out
there
you
s
dreadfully
shy
and
proud
said
pavel
pavlovitch
just
like
her
liza
entered
the
room
without
tears
but
with
eyes
downcast
her
father
leading
her
by
the
hand
she
was
a
tall
slight
and
very
pretty
little
girl
she
raised
her
large
blue
eyes
to
the
visitor
s
face
with
curiosity
but
only
glanced
surlily
at
him
and
dropped
them
again
there
was
that
in
her
expression
that
one
always
sees
in
children
when
they
look
on
some
new
guest
for
the
first
to
a
corner
and
looking
out
at
him
thence
seriously
and
mistrustingly
only
that
there
was
a
something
in
her
manner
beyond
the
usual
childish
at
least
thought
velchaninoff
her
father
brought
her
straight
up
to
the
visitor
gentleman
knew
mother
very
well
he
was
our
friend
you
mustn
t
be
shy
him
your
hand
the
child
bowed
slightly
and
timidly
stretched
out
her
hand
natalia
vasilievna
never
would
teach
her
to
curtsey
she
liked
her
to
bow
english
fashion
and
give
her
hand
explained
pavel
pavlovitch
gazing
intently
at
velchaninoff
velchaninoff
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
other
was
keenly
examining
him
at
this
moment
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
agitation
he
sat
motionless
on
his
chair
and
held
the
child
s
hand
in
his
gazing
into
her
face
the
while
but
liza
was
apparently
much
preoccupied
and
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
father
s
face
she
listened
timidly
to
every
word
he
said
velchaninoff
recognised
her
large
blue
eyes
at
once
but
what
specially
struck
him
was
the
refined
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
colour
of
her
hair
these
traits
were
altogether
too
significant
in
his
eyes
her
features
on
the
other
hand
and
the
set
of
her
lips
reminded
him
keenly
of
natalia
vasilievna
meanwhile
pavel
pavlovitch
was
in
the
middle
of
some
apparently
most
interesting
of
great
sentiment
seemingly
velchaninoff
did
not
hear
a
word
of
it
until
the
last
few
words
struck
upon
his
ear
so
that
you
can
t
imagine
what
our
joy
was
when
providence
sent
us
this
gift
alexey
ivanovitch
she
was
everything
to
me
for
i
felt
that
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
heaven
to
deprive
me
of
my
other
joy
i
should
still
have
liza
left
to
me
that
s
what
i
felt
sir
i
did
indeed
and
natalia
vasilievna
asked
velchaninoff
oh
natalia
began
pavel
pavlovitch
smiling
with
one
side
of
his
mouth
she
never
used
to
like
to
say
you
know
yourself
but
she
told
me
on
her
you
know
the
very
day
of
her
death
she
used
to
get
so
angry
and
say
that
they
were
trying
to
cure
her
with
a
lot
of
nasty
medicines
when
she
had
nothing
the
matter
but
a
simple
little
feverish
attack
and
that
when
koch
arrived
you
remember
our
old
doctor
koch
he
would
make
her
all
right
in
a
fortnight
why
five
hours
before
she
died
she
was
talking
of
fixing
that
day
three
weeks
for
a
visit
to
her
aunt
liza
s
godmother
at
her
country
place
velchaninoff
here
started
from
his
seat
but
still
held
the
child
s
hand
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
there
was
something
reproachful
in
the
girl
s
persistent
stare
in
her
father
s
face
is
she
ill
he
asked
hurriedly
and
his
voice
had
a
strange
tone
in
it
no
i
don
t
think
so
said
pavel
pavlovitch
but
you
see
our
way
of
living
here
and
all
that
she
s
a
strange
child
and
very
nervous
besides
after
her
mother
s
death
she
was
quite
ill
and
hysterical
for
a
fortnight
just
before
you
came
in
she
was
crying
like
anything
and
do
you
know
what
about
sir
do
you
hear
me
liza
listen
because
i
was
going
out
and
wished
to
leave
her
behind
and
because
she
said
i
didn
t
love
her
so
well
as
i
used
to
in
her
mother
s
time
that
s
what
she
pitches
into
me
for
fancy
a
child
like
this
getting
hold
of
such
an
idea
child
who
ought
to
be
playing
at
dolls
instead
of
developing
ideas
of
that
sort
the
thing
is
she
has
no
one
to
play
with
you
two
quite
alone
here
quite
a
servant
comes
in
once
a
day
that
s
all
and
when
you
go
out
do
you
leave
her
quite
alone
of
course
what
else
am
i
to
do
yesterday
i
locked
her
in
that
room
and
that
s
what
all
the
tears
were
about
this
morning
what
could
i
do
the
day
before
yesterday
she
went
down
into
the
yard
all
by
herself
and
a
boy
took
a
shot
at
her
head
with
a
stone
not
only
that
but
she
must
needs
go
and
cling
on
to
everybody
she
met
and
ask
where
i
had
gone
to
that
s
not
so
very
pleasant
you
see
but
i
oughtn
t
to
complain
when
i
say
i
am
going
out
for
an
hour
and
then
stay
out
till
four
in
the
morning
as
i
did
last
night
the
landlady
came
and
let
her
out
she
had
the
door
broken
open
nice
for
my
feelings
eh
it
s
all
the
result
of
the
eclipse
that
came
over
my
life
nothing
but
that
sir
papa
said
the
child
timidly
and
anxiously
now
then
none
of
that
again
what
did
i
tell
you
yesterday
i
won
t
i
won
t
cried
the
child
hurriedly
clasping
her
hands
before
her
entreatingly
come
things
can
t
be
allowed
to
go
on
in
this
way
said
velchaninoff
impatiently
and
with
authority
in
the
first
place
you
are
a
man
of
property
how
can
you
possibly
live
in
a
hole
like
this
and
in
such
disorder
this
place
oh
but
we
shall
probably
have
left
this
place
within
a
week
and
i
ve
spent
a
lot
of
money
here
as
it
is
though
i
may
be
a
man
of
property
very
well
that
ll
do
interrupted
velchaninoff
with
growing
impatience
now
i
ll
make
you
a
proposition
you
have
just
said
that
you
intend
to
stay
another
two
i
have
a
house
rather
i
know
a
family
where
i
am
as
much
at
home
as
at
my
own
fireside
and
have
been
so
for
twenty
years
the
family
i
mean
is
the
pavlovitch
pogoryeltseff
is
a
state
councillor
he
may
be
of
use
to
you
in
your
business
they
are
now
living
in
the
have
a
beautiful
country
villa
claudia
petrovna
the
lady
of
the
house
is
like
a
a
mother
to
me
they
have
eight
children
let
me
take
liza
down
to
them
without
loss
of
time
they
ll
receive
her
with
joy
and
they
ll
treat
her
like
their
own
little
will
indeed
velchaninoff
was
in
a
great
hurry
and
much
excited
and
he
did
not
conceal
his
feelings
i
m
afraid
it
s
impossible
said
pavel
pavlovitch
with
a
grimace
looking
straight
into
his
visitor
s
eyes
very
cunningly
as
it
seemed
to
velchaninoff
why
why
impossible
oh
why
to
let
the
child
suddenly
you
know
of
course
with
such
a
sincere
as
s
not
that
a
strange
such
swells
too
don
t
know
whether
they
would
receive
her
but
i
tell
you
i
m
like
a
son
of
the
house
cried
velchaninoff
almost
angrily
claudia
petrovna
will
be
delighted
to
take
her
at
one
word
from
me
she
d
receive
her
as
though
she
were
my
own
daughter
deuce
take
it
sir
you
know
you
are
only
humbugging
me
s
the
use
of
talking
about
it
he
stamped
his
foot
i
mean
to
t
it
look
a
little
strange
oughtn
t
i
to
call
once
or
twice
first
a
smart
house
as
you
say
theirs
t
you
i
tell
you
it
s
the
simplest
house
in
the
world
it
isn
t
smart
in
the
least
bit
cried
velchaninoff
they
have
a
lot
of
children
it
will
make
another
girl
of
her
ll
introduce
you
there
myself
if
you
like
of
course
you
ll
have
to
go
and
thank
them
and
all
that
you
shall
go
down
every
day
with
me
if
you
oh
nonsense
you
know
it
s
nonsense
now
look
here
you
come
to
me
this
ll
put
you
up
for
the
we
ll
start
off
early
and
be
down
there
by
benefactor
i
may
spend
the
night
at
your
house
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
instantly
consenting
to
the
plan
with
the
greatest
cordiality
you
are
really
good
and
where
s
their
country
house
at
the
but
look
here
how
about
her
dress
such
a
house
you
know
father
s
heart
nonsense
s
in
else
could
she
wear
but
a
black
dress
like
this
it
s
exactly
the
thing
you
couldn
t
imagine
anything
more
so
might
let
her
have
some
clean
linen
with
her
and
give
her
a
cleaner
directly
directly
we
ll
get
her
linen
together
in
a
couple
of
s
just
home
from
the
wash
send
for
a
you
tell
them
to
let
us
have
it
at
once
so
as
not
to
waste
but
now
an
unexpected
obstacle
arose
liza
absolutely
rejected
the
plan
she
had
listened
to
it
with
terror
and
if
velchaninoff
had
in
his
excited
argument
with
pavel
pavlovitch
had
time
to
glance
at
the
child
s
face
he
would
have
observed
her
expression
of
absolute
despair
at
this
moment
i
won
t
go
she
said
quietly
but
firmly
at
that
just
like
her
mamma
i
m
like
mamma
i
m
like
mamma
cried
liza
wringing
her
little
hands
in
despair
oh
she
added
if
you
desert
she
suddenly
threw
herself
upon
the
alarmed
if
you
take
me
she
i
but
liza
had
no
time
to
finish
her
sentence
for
pavel
pavlovitch
suddenly
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
collar
and
hustled
her
into
the
next
room
with
unconcealed
rage
for
several
minutes
velchaninoff
listened
to
the
whispering
going
on
there
and
seemingly
subdued
crying
on
the
part
of
liza
he
was
about
to
follow
the
pair
when
suddenly
out
came
pavel
pavlovitch
and
a
disagreeable
liza
would
come
directly
velchaninoff
tried
not
to
look
at
him
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
elderly
woman
whom
velchaninoff
had
met
on
the
stairs
also
made
her
appearance
and
packed
liza
s
things
into
a
neat
little
carpet
bag
is
it
you
that
are
going
to
take
the
little
lady
away
sir
she
asked
if
so
you
are
doing
a
good
deed
she
s
a
nice
quiet
child
and
you
are
saving
her
from
goodness
knows
what
here
oh
sisevna
pavel
pavlovitch
well
what
isn
t
it
true
arn
t
you
ashamed
to
let
a
girl
of
her
intelligence
see
the
things
that
you
allow
to
go
on
here
the
carriage
has
arrived
for
you
sir
ordered
one
for
the
liesnoy
didn
t
you
well
good
luck
to
you
liza
came
out
looking
very
pale
and
with
downcast
eyes
she
took
her
bag
but
never
glanced
in
velchaninoff
s
direction
she
restrained
herself
and
did
not
throw
herself
upon
her
father
as
she
had
done
even
to
say
she
evidently
did
not
wish
to
look
at
him
her
father
kissed
her
and
patted
her
head
in
correct
form
her
lip
curled
during
the
operation
the
chin
trembled
a
little
but
she
did
not
raise
her
eyes
to
her
father
s
pavel
pavlovitch
looked
pale
and
his
hands
shook
velchaninoff
saw
that
plainly
enough
although
he
did
his
best
not
to
see
the
man
at
all
he
velchaninoff
had
but
one
thought
and
that
was
how
to
get
away
at
once
downstairs
was
old
maria
sisevna
waiting
to
say
and
more
kissing
was
done
liza
had
just
climbed
into
the
carriage
when
suddenly
she
caught
sight
of
her
father
s
face
she
gave
a
loud
cry
and
wrung
her
hands
another
minute
she
would
have
been
out
of
the
carriage
and
away
but
luckily
the
vehicle
went
on
and
she
was
too
late
chapter
vi
are
you
feeling
faint
asked
velchaninoff
of
his
companion
frightened
out
of
his
wits
i
ll
tell
him
to
stop
and
get
you
some
water
shall
i
she
looked
at
him
angrily
and
reproachfully
where
are
you
taking
me
to
she
asked
coldly
and
abruptly
to
a
very
beautiful
house
liza
there
are
plenty
of
children
ll
all
love
you
there
they
are
so
kind
don
t
be
angry
with
me
liza
i
wish
you
well
you
know
in
truth
velchaninoff
would
have
looked
strange
at
this
moment
to
any
acquaintance
if
such
had
happened
to
see
him
wicked
you
are
said
liza
fighting
with
suppressed
tears
and
flashing
her
fine
angry
eyes
at
him
but
you
are
wicked
cried
liza
she
wrung
her
hands
velchaninoff
was
beside
himself
oh
liza
liza
if
only
you
knew
what
despair
you
are
causing
me
he
said
is
it
true
that
he
is
coming
down
asked
the
child
is
it
true
or
not
quite
shall
bring
him
down
myself
shall
take
him
and
bring
him
he
will
deceive
you
somehow
cried
the
child
drooping
her
eyes
doesn
t
he
love
you
then
liza
has
he
you
he
liza
looked
gloomily
at
her
questioner
and
said
nothing
she
then
turned
away
from
him
and
sat
still
and
depressed
velchaninoff
commenced
to
talk
he
tried
to
win
her
spoke
liza
listened
incredulously
and
with
a
hostile
air
still
she
listened
her
attention
delighted
him
beyond
measure
went
so
far
as
to
explain
to
her
what
it
meant
when
a
man
took
to
drink
he
said
that
he
loved
her
and
would
himself
look
after
her
father
at
last
liza
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
fixedly
at
him
then
velchaninoff
began
to
speak
of
her
mother
and
of
how
well
he
had
known
her
and
he
saw
that
his
tales
attracted
her
little
by
little
she
began
to
reply
to
his
questions
but
very
cautiously
and
in
an
obstinately
monosyllabic
way
she
would
answer
nothing
to
his
chief
inquiries
as
to
her
former
relations
with
her
father
for
instance
she
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
while
speaking
to
her
velchaninoff
held
the
child
s
hand
in
his
own
as
before
and
she
did
not
try
to
take
it
away
liza
said
enough
to
make
it
apparent
that
she
had
loved
her
father
more
than
her
mother
at
first
because
that
her
father
had
loved
the
child
better
than
her
mother
did
but
that
when
her
mother
had
died
and
was
lying
dead
liza
wept
over
her
and
kissed
her
and
ever
since
then
she
had
loved
her
mother
more
than
there
was
in
the
whole
that
every
night
she
thought
of
her
and
loved
her
but
liza
was
very
proud
and
suddenly
recollecting
herself
and
finding
that
she
was
saying
a
great
deal
more
than
she
had
meant
to
reveal
she
paused
and
relapsed
into
obstinate
silence
once
more
and
gazed
at
velchaninoff
with
something
like
hatred
in
her
eyes
considering
that
he
had
beguiled
her
into
the
revelations
just
made
by
the
end
of
the
journey
however
her
hysterical
condition
was
nearly
over
but
she
was
very
silent
and
sat
looking
morosely
about
her
obstinately
silent
and
gloomy
like
a
little
wild
animal
the
fact
that
she
was
being
taken
to
a
strange
house
where
she
had
never
been
before
did
not
seem
so
far
to
weigh
upon
her
velchaninoff
saw
clearly
enough
that
other
things
distressed
her
and
principally
that
she
was
that
her
father
should
have
let
her
go
so
her
away
as
it
velchaninoff
s
arms
she
s
ill
thought
the
latter
and
perhaps
very
ill
she
has
been
bullied
and
oh
that
drunken
blackguardly
wretch
of
a
fellow
he
hurried
on
the
coachman
velchaninoff
trusted
greatly
to
the
fresh
air
to
the
garden
to
the
children
to
the
new
life
now
as
to
the
future
he
was
in
no
sort
of
doubt
at
all
his
hopes
were
clear
and
defined
one
thing
he
was
quite
sure
of
and
that
was
that
he
had
never
before
felt
what
now
swelled
within
his
soul
and
that
the
sensation
would
last
for
ever
and
ever
i
have
an
object
at
last
this
is
life
he
said
to
himself
enthusiastically
many
thoughts
welled
into
his
brain
just
now
but
he
would
have
none
of
them
he
did
not
care
to
think
of
details
at
this
moment
for
without
details
the
future
was
all
so
clear
and
so
beautiful
and
so
safe
and
indestructible
the
basis
of
his
plan
was
simple
enough
it
was
simply
this
in
the
language
of
his
own
thoughts
i
shall
so
work
upon
that
drunken
little
blackguard
that
he
will
leave
liza
with
the
pogoryeltseffs
and
go
away
first
for
a
time
of
course
so
liza
shall
remain
behind
for
me
what
more
do
i
want
the
plan
will
suit
him
too
why
does
he
bully
her
like
this
the
carriage
arrived
at
last
it
was
certainly
a
very
beautiful
place
they
were
met
first
of
all
by
a
troop
of
noisy
children
who
overflowed
on
to
the
steps
velchaninoff
had
not
been
down
for
some
time
and
the
delight
of
the
little
ones
to
see
him
was
were
very
fond
of
him
the
elder
ones
shouted
before
he
had
left
the
carriage
by
way
of
chaff
how
s
the
lawsuit
getting
on
eh
and
the
smaller
gang
took
up
the
joke
and
all
clamoured
the
same
question
it
was
a
pet
joke
in
this
establishment
to
chaff
velchaninoff
about
his
lawsuit
but
when
liza
climbed
down
the
carriage
steps
she
was
instantly
surrounded
and
stared
at
with
true
juvenile
curiosity
then
claudia
petrovna
and
her
husband
came
out
and
both
of
them
bantered
velchaninoff
about
his
lawsuit
claudia
petrovna
was
a
lady
of
some
summers
stout
and
and
with
a
sweet
face
her
husband
was
a
man
of
a
clever
and
man
of
the
world
but
above
all
a
good
and
friend
to
anyone
requiring
kindness
the
pogoryeltseffs
house
was
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
a
home
to
velchaninoff
as
the
latter
had
stated
there
was
rather
more
here
however
for
twenty
years
since
claudia
had
very
nearly
married
young
velchaninoff
almost
a
boy
at
that
time
and
a
student
at
the
university
this
had
been
his
first
experience
of
very
hot
and
fiery
and
sweet
it
was
the
end
of
it
was
however
that
claudia
married
mr
pogoryeltseff
five
years
later
she
and
velchaninoff
had
met
again
and
a
quiet
candid
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
them
since
then
there
had
always
been
a
warmth
a
speciality
about
their
friendship
a
radiance
which
overspread
it
and
glorified
their
relations
one
to
the
other
there
was
nothing
here
that
velchaninoff
could
remember
with
was
pure
and
sweet
and
this
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
the
friendship
was
specially
dear
to
velchaninoff
he
had
not
experienced
many
such
platonic
intimacies
in
this
house
velchaninoff
was
simple
and
happy
confessed
his
sins
played
with
the
children
and
lectured
them
and
never
bothered
his
head
about
outside
matters
he
had
promised
the
pogoryeltseffs
that
he
would
live
a
few
more
years
alone
in
the
world
and
then
move
over
to
their
household
for
good
and
all
and
he
looked
forward
to
that
good
time
coming
with
all
seriousness
velchaninoff
now
gave
all
the
information
about
liza
which
he
thought
fit
though
his
simple
request
would
have
been
amply
sufficient
here
claudia
petrovna
kissed
the
little
orphan
and
promised
to
do
all
she
possibly
could
for
her
and
the
children
carried
liza
off
to
play
in
the
garden
half
an
hour
passed
in
conversation
and
then
velchaninoff
rose
to
depart
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
his
friends
could
not
help
remarking
upon
the
fact
he
had
not
been
near
them
for
three
weeks
they
said
and
now
he
only
stayed
half
an
hour
velchaninoff
laughed
and
promised
to
come
down
someone
observed
that
velchaninoff
s
state
of
agitation
was
remarkable
even
for
whereupon
the
latter
jumped
up
seized
claudia
petrovna
s
hand
and
under
pretence
of
having
forgotten
to
tell
her
something
most
important
about
liza
he
led
her
into
another
room
do
you
remember
he
began
what
i
told
you
and
only
you
your
husband
does
not
know
of
my
year
of
life
down
at
oh
yes
only
too
well
you
have
often
spoken
of
did
not
speak
about
it
i
and
only
to
yourself
but
i
never
told
you
the
lady
s
name
it
was
trusotsky
the
wife
of
this
trusotsky
it
is
she
who
has
died
and
this
little
liza
is
her
child
is
this
certain
are
you
quite
sure
there
is
no
mistake
asked
claudia
petrovna
with
some
agitation
quite
quite
certain
said
velchaninoff
enthusiastically
he
then
gave
a
short
hasty
and
excited
narrative
of
all
that
had
occurred
claudia
had
heard
it
all
before
excepting
the
lady
s
name
the
fact
is
velchaninoff
had
always
been
so
afraid
that
one
of
his
friends
might
some
fine
day
meet
madame
trusotsky
at
and
wonder
how
in
the
world
he
could
have
loved
such
a
woman
as
that
that
he
had
never
revealed
her
name
to
a
single
soul
not
even
to
claudia
petrovna
his
great
friend
and
does
the
father
know
nothing
of
it
asked
claudia
having
heard
the
tale
out
he
see
that
s
just
what
is
bothering
me
now
i
haven
t
sifted
the
matter
as
yet
resumed
velchaninoff
hotly
he
must
know
i
remarked
that
fact
both
yesterday
and
but
i
wish
to
discover
he
knows
that
s
why
i
am
hurrying
back
now
he
is
coming
he
knows
all
about
bagantoff
but
how
about
myself
you
know
how
such
wives
can
deceive
their
husbands
if
an
angel
from
heaven
were
to
come
down
and
convict
a
woman
her
husband
will
still
trust
her
and
give
the
angel
the
lie
oh
don
t
nod
your
head
at
me
don
t
judge
me
i
have
long
since
judged
and
convicted
myself
you
see
this
morning
i
felt
so
sure
that
he
knew
all
that
i
compromised
myself
before
him
fancy
i
was
really
ashamed
of
having
been
rude
to
him
last
night
he
only
called
in
to
see
me
out
of
the
pure
unconquerably
malicious
desire
to
show
me
that
he
knew
all
the
offence
and
knew
who
was
the
offender
i
behaved
like
a
fool
i
gave
myself
into
his
hands
too
easily
i
was
too
heated
he
came
at
such
a
feverish
moment
for
me
i
tell
you
he
has
been
bullying
liza
simply
to
let
off
bile
understand
he
needs
a
for
his
offended
feelings
and
vents
them
upon
even
a
little
child
it
is
exasperation
and
quite
natural
we
must
treat
him
in
a
christian
spirit
my
friend
and
do
you
know
i
wish
to
change
my
way
of
treating
him
entirely
i
wish
to
be
particularly
kind
to
him
that
will
be
a
good
action
on
my
part
for
i
am
to
blame
before
him
i
know
i
am
there
s
no
disguising
the
fact
besides
once
at
it
so
happened
that
i
required
four
thousand
roubles
at
a
moment
s
notice
well
the
fellow
gave
me
the
money
without
a
receipt
at
once
and
with
every
manifestation
of
delight
to
be
able
to
serve
me
and
i
took
the
money
from
his
hands
did
indeed
i
took
it
as
though
he
were
a
friend
think
of
that
very
well
only
be
careful
said
claudia
petrovna
you
are
so
enthusiastic
that
i
am
really
alarmed
for
you
of
course
liza
shall
now
be
no
less
than
my
own
daughter
to
me
but
there
is
so
much
to
know
and
to
settle
yet
above
all
be
very
careful
and
observant
you
are
not
nearly
careful
enough
when
you
are
happy
you
are
much
too
exalted
an
individual
to
be
cautious
when
you
are
happy
she
added
with
a
smile
the
whole
family
went
out
to
see
velchaninoff
off
the
children
brought
liza
along
with
them
they
had
been
playing
in
the
garden
they
seemed
to
look
at
her
now
with
even
more
perplexity
then
at
first
the
girl
became
dreadfully
shy
when
velchaninoff
kissed
her
before
all
and
promised
to
come
down
next
day
and
bring
her
father
with
him
to
the
last
moment
she
did
not
say
a
single
word
and
never
looked
at
him
at
all
but
just
before
he
was
about
to
start
she
seized
his
hand
and
drew
him
away
to
one
side
looking
imploringly
in
his
face
she
evidently
had
something
to
say
to
him
velchaninoff
immediately
took
her
into
an
adjoining
room
what
is
it
liza
he
asked
kindly
and
encouragingly
but
she
drew
him
farther
away
the
very
farthest
corner
of
the
room
anxious
to
get
well
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
rest
what
is
it
liza
what
is
it
but
she
was
still
silent
and
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
speak
she
stared
with
her
motionless
large
blue
eyes
into
his
face
and
in
every
lineament
of
her
little
face
was
betrayed
the
wildest
terror
and
anxiety
he
himself
she
whispered
at
last
as
though
she
were
talking
in
her
sleep
who
will
hang
himself
asked
velchaninoff
in
alarm
he
he
tried
to
hang
himself
to
a
hook
last
night
said
the
child
panting
with
haste
and
excitement
i
saw
it
myself
he
tried
it
again
wishes
to
hang
himself
he
told
me
so
told
me
so
he
wanted
to
long
ago
he
has
always
wanted
to
do
it
i
saw
it
the
night
impossible
muttered
velchaninoff
incredulously
liza
suddenly
threw
herself
into
his
arms
kissed
his
hands
and
cried
she
could
hardly
breathe
for
sobbing
she
was
begging
and
imploring
velchaninoff
but
he
could
not
understand
what
she
was
trying
to
say
velchaninoff
never
afterwards
forgot
the
terrible
look
of
this
distressed
child
he
thought
of
it
waking
and
thought
of
it
she
had
come
to
him
in
her
despair
as
to
her
last
hope
and
hysterically
begged
and
prayed
him
to
help
her
and
to
think
of
her
being
so
deeply
attached
to
him
he
reflected
jealously
as
he
drove
impatient
and
feverish
towards
town
she
said
herself
that
she
loved
her
mother
better
she
hates
him
and
doesn
t
love
him
at
all
and
what
s
all
that
nonsense
about
hanging
himself
what
did
she
mean
by
that
as
if
he
would
hang
himself
the
fool
i
must
sift
the
whole
matter
i
must
settle
this
business
once
and
for
quickly
chapter
vii
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
know
in
order
to
lose
no
time
about
finding
out
what
he
felt
he
must
know
at
once
he
told
the
coachman
to
drive
him
straight
to
trusotsky
s
rooms
on
the
way
he
changed
his
mind
let
him
come
to
me
himself
he
thought
and
meanwhile
i
can
attend
to
my
cursed
law
but
he
really
felt
that
he
was
too
absent
to
attend
to
anything
at
all
and
at
five
o
clock
he
set
out
with
the
intention
of
dining
and
at
this
moment
for
the
first
time
an
amusing
idea
struck
him
what
if
he
really
only
hindered
his
law
business
by
meddling
as
he
did
and
hunting
his
wretched
lawyer
about
the
place
when
the
latter
plainly
avoided
meeting
him
velchaninoff
laughed
merrily
over
this
idea
and
yet
he
thought
if
this
notion
had
struck
me
in
the
evening
instead
of
now
how
angry
i
should
have
been
he
laughed
again
more
merrily
than
before
but
in
spite
of
his
merriness
he
grew
more
and
more
thoughtful
and
impatient
and
could
settle
to
nothing
nor
could
he
think
out
what
he
most
wanted
to
reflect
upon
i
have
that
fellow
here
he
said
at
length
i
must
read
the
mystery
of
first
of
all
and
then
i
can
settle
what
to
do
next
there
s
a
duel
in
this
business
returning
home
at
seven
o
clock
he
did
not
find
pavel
pavlovitch
there
which
fact
first
surprised
him
then
angered
him
then
depressed
him
and
at
last
frightened
him
god
knows
god
knows
how
it
will
all
end
he
cried
first
trying
to
settle
himself
on
a
sofa
and
then
marching
up
and
down
the
room
and
all
the
while
looking
at
his
watch
every
other
minute
at
about
nine
o
pavlovitch
appeared
if
this
man
was
cunning
enough
to
mean
it
he
could
not
have
managed
better
in
order
to
put
me
into
a
state
of
nervousness
thought
velchaninoff
though
his
heart
bounded
for
joy
to
see
his
guest
arrive
to
velchaninoff
s
cordial
inquiry
as
to
why
he
was
so
late
pavel
pavlovitch
smiled
a
seat
with
easy
familiarity
carelessly
threw
his
crapebound
hat
on
a
chair
made
himself
perfectly
at
home
velchaninoff
observed
and
took
stock
of
the
careless
manner
adopted
by
his
visitor
it
was
not
like
yesterday
velchaninoff
then
quietly
and
in
a
few
words
gave
pavel
pavlovitch
an
account
of
what
he
had
done
with
liza
of
how
kindly
she
had
been
received
of
how
good
it
would
be
for
the
child
down
there
then
he
led
the
conversation
to
the
topic
of
the
pogoryeltseffs
leaving
liza
out
of
the
talking
altogether
and
spoke
of
how
kind
the
whole
family
were
of
how
long
he
had
known
them
and
so
on
pavel
pavlovitch
listened
absently
occasionally
looking
ironically
at
his
host
from
under
his
eyelashes
what
an
enthusiast
you
are
he
muttered
at
last
smiling
very
unpleasantly
hum
you
seem
in
a
bad
humour
remarked
velchaninoff
with
annoyance
and
why
shouldn
t
i
be
as
wicked
as
my
neighbours
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
suddenly
he
said
this
so
abruptly
that
he
gave
one
the
idea
that
he
had
pounced
out
of
a
corner
where
he
had
been
lurking
on
purpose
to
make
a
dash
at
the
first
opportunity
oh
dear
me
do
as
you
like
pray
laughed
velchaninoff
i
only
thought
something
had
put
you
out
perhaps
so
it
has
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
as
though
proud
of
the
fact
well
what
was
it
pavel
pavlovitch
waited
a
moment
or
two
before
he
replied
why
it
s
that
stepan
michailovitch
bagantoff
of
to
his
tricks
again
he
s
a
shining
light
among
the
highest
circles
of
is
wouldn
t
he
receive
you
what
not
quite
that
this
time
on
the
contrary
i
was
allowed
to
go
in
for
the
first
time
on
record
and
i
had
the
honour
of
musing
over
his
features
too
he
happened
to
be
a
corpse
that
s
all
what
bagantoff
dead
cried
velchaninoff
in
the
greatest
astonishment
though
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
he
be
surprised
friend
is
dead
yesterday
at
about
and
i
knew
nothing
of
it
perhaps
he
died
just
when
i
called
knows
is
the
funeral
he
s
in
his
coffin
at
this
moment
died
of
nervous
fever
and
they
let
me
in
to
see
did
indeed
contemplate
his
features
i
told
them
i
was
a
great
therefore
they
allowed
me
in
a
pretty
trick
he
has
played
dear
friend
of
six
years
standing
i
came
to
petersburg
for
s
hardly
worth
your
while
to
be
angry
with
him
about
it
is
didn
t
die
on
purpose
said
velchaninoff
laughing
oh
but
i
m
speaking
out
of
pure
was
a
friend
to
me
oh
a
dear
friend
pavel
pavlovitch
gave
a
smile
of
detestable
irony
and
cunning
do
you
know
what
alexey
ivanovitch
he
resumed
i
think
you
ought
to
treat
me
to
something
have
often
treated
you
i
used
to
be
your
host
every
blessed
day
sir
at
for
a
whole
year
send
for
a
bottle
of
wine
throat
is
so
dry
with
didn
t
you
say
so
before
what
would
you
like
don
t
say
you
say
we
we
ll
drink
together
of
course
said
pavel
pavlovitch
defiantly
but
at
the
same
time
looking
into
velchaninoff
s
eyes
with
some
concern
shall
it
be
champagne
of
course
it
isn
t
time
for
vodki
yet
velchaninoff
rose
the
bell
and
gave
mavra
the
necessary
orders
we
ll
drink
to
this
happy
meeting
of
friends
after
nine
years
parting
said
pavel
pavlovitch
with
a
very
inappropriate
and
unnecessary
giggle
why
you
are
the
only
real
true
friend
left
to
me
now
bagantoff
is
no
more
it
quite
reminds
one
of
the
great
poet
great
patroclus
is
no
more
mean
thersites
liveth
yet
so
on
t
you
know
at
the
name
thersites
pavel
pavlovitch
touched
his
own
breast
i
wish
you
would
speak
plainly
you
pig
of
a
fellow
said
velchaninoff
to
himself
i
hate
hints
his
own
anger
was
on
the
rise
and
he
had
long
been
struggling
with
his
look
here
me
this
since
you
consider
bagantoff
to
have
been
guilty
before
you
as
i
see
you
do
surely
you
must
be
glad
that
your
betrayer
is
dead
what
are
you
so
angry
about
glad
why
should
i
be
glad
i
judge
by
what
i
should
imagine
your
feelings
to
well
this
time
you
are
a
little
bit
in
error
as
to
my
feelings
for
once
a
certain
sage
has
said
my
good
enemy
is
dead
but
i
have
a
still
better
one
alive
well
but
you
saw
him
alive
for
five
years
at
a
stretch
should
have
thought
that
was
enough
to
contemplate
his
features
in
said
velchaninoff
angrily
and
contemptuously
yes
but
how
was
i
to
know
then
sir
snapped
pavel
out
of
an
ambush
once
more
as
it
were
to
be
asked
a
question
which
he
had
long
awaited
why
what
do
you
take
me
for
alexey
ivanovitch
at
this
moment
there
was
in
the
speaker
s
face
a
new
expression
altogether
transfiguring
entirely
the
hitherto
merely
disagreeably
malicious
look
upon
it
do
you
mean
to
say
you
knew
nothing
of
it
said
velchaninoff
in
astonishment
how
didn
t
know
as
if
i
could
have
known
it
you
race
of
jupiters
you
reckon
a
man
to
be
no
better
than
a
dog
and
judge
of
him
by
your
own
sentiments
look
here
sir
look
at
so
saying
he
brought
his
fist
madly
down
upon
the
table
with
a
resounding
bang
and
immediately
afterwards
looked
frightened
at
his
own
act
velchaninoff
s
face
beamed
listen
pavel
pavlovitch
he
said
it
is
entirely
the
same
thing
to
me
whether
you
knew
or
did
not
know
all
about
it
if
you
did
not
know
so
much
the
more
honourable
is
it
for
you
can
t
understand
why
you
should
have
selected
me
for
your
i
wasn
t
talking
of
you
don
t
be
angry
it
wasn
t
about
you
muttered
pavel
pavlovitch
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
at
this
moment
mavra
entered
with
the
champagne
here
it
is
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
immensely
delighted
at
the
appearance
of
the
wine
now
then
tumblers
my
good
girl
tumblers
quick
capital
thank
you
we
don
t
require
you
any
more
my
good
mavra
what
you
ve
drawn
the
cork
excellent
creature
well
off
with
mavra
s
advent
with
the
bottle
so
encouraged
him
that
he
again
looked
at
velchaninoff
with
some
defiance
now
confess
he
giggled
suddenly
confess
that
you
are
very
curious
indeed
to
hear
about
all
this
and
that
it
is
by
no
means
entirely
the
same
to
you
as
you
declared
confess
that
you
would
be
miserable
if
i
were
to
get
up
and
go
away
this
very
minute
without
telling
you
anything
not
the
least
in
the
world
i
assure
you
pavel
pavlovitch
smiled
and
his
smile
said
as
plainly
as
words
could
that
s
a
lie
well
let
s
to
business
he
said
and
poured
out
two
glasses
of
champagne
here
s
a
toast
he
continued
raising
his
goblet
to
the
health
in
paradise
of
our
dear
departed
friend
he
raised
his
glass
and
drank
i
won
t
drink
such
a
toast
as
that
said
velchaninoff
and
put
his
glass
down
on
the
table
why
not
it
s
a
very
pretty
look
here
were
you
drunk
when
you
came
here
a
little
why
particular
only
it
appeared
to
me
that
yesterday
and
especially
this
morning
you
were
sincerely
sorry
for
the
loss
of
natalia
and
who
says
i
am
not
sorry
now
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
as
if
somebody
had
pulled
a
string
and
made
him
snap
the
words
out
like
a
doll
no
i
don
t
mean
that
but
you
must
admit
you
may
be
in
error
about
bagantoff
and
that
s
a
serious
matter
pavel
pavlovitch
grinned
and
gave
a
wink
hey
wouldn
t
you
just
like
to
know
how
i
found
out
about
bagantoff
eh
velchaninoff
blushed
i
repeat
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
he
said
and
added
to
himself
hadn
t
i
better
pitch
him
and
the
bottle
out
of
the
window
he
was
blushing
more
and
more
now
pavel
pavlovitch
poured
himself
out
another
glass
i
ll
tell
you
directly
how
i
found
out
all
about
bagantoff
and
your
burning
wish
shall
be
satisfied
for
you
are
a
fiery
sort
of
man
you
know
alexey
ivanovitch
oh
dreadfully
so
just
give
me
a
cigarette
first
will
you
for
ever
since
here
s
a
cigarette
for
ever
since
march
i
have
been
a
depraved
man
sir
and
this
is
how
it
all
came
about
listen
consumption
as
you
know
my
dear
friend
pavel
pavlovitch
was
growing
more
and
more
familiar
is
an
interesting
malady
one
sees
a
man
dying
of
consumption
without
a
suspicion
that
is
to
be
his
last
day
well
i
told
you
how
natalia
vasilievna
up
to
five
hours
before
her
death
talked
about
going
to
visit
her
aunt
who
lived
thirty
miles
or
so
away
and
starting
in
a
fortnight
you
know
how
some
gentlemen
too
i
the
bad
habit
of
keeping
a
lot
of
old
rubbish
by
them
in
the
way
of
and
so
on
it
would
be
much
safer
to
stick
them
all
into
the
fire
wouldn
t
it
but
no
they
must
keep
every
little
scrap
of
paper
in
drawers
and
desks
and
endorse
it
and
classify
it
and
tie
it
up
in
bundles
for
each
year
and
month
and
class
i
don
t
know
whether
they
find
this
consoling
to
their
feelings
afterwards
or
what
well
since
she
was
arranging
a
visit
to
her
aunt
just
five
hours
before
her
death
natalia
vasilievna
naturally
did
not
expect
to
die
so
soon
in
fact
she
was
expecting
old
doctor
koch
down
till
the
last
and
so
when
natalia
vasilievna
die
she
left
behind
her
a
beautiful
little
black
desk
all
inlaid
with
and
bound
with
silver
in
her
bureau
oh
a
lovely
little
box
an
heirloom
left
her
by
her
grandmother
with
a
lock
and
key
all
complete
well
sir
in
this
box
mean
you
know
for
every
day
and
hour
for
the
last
twenty
disclosed
and
since
bagantoff
had
a
decided
taste
for
literature
indeed
he
had
published
a
passionate
novel
once
i
am
told
in
a
newspaper
there
were
about
a
hundred
examples
of
his
genius
in
the
desk
ranging
over
a
period
of
five
years
some
of
these
talented
effusions
were
covered
with
pencilled
remarks
by
natalia
vasilievna
herself
pleasant
that
for
a
fond
husband
s
feelings
sir
eh
velchaninoff
quickly
cast
his
thoughts
back
over
the
past
and
remembered
that
he
had
never
written
a
single
letter
or
a
single
note
to
natalia
vasilievna
he
had
written
a
couple
of
letters
from
petersburg
but
according
to
a
previous
arrangement
he
had
addressed
them
to
both
and
trusotsky
together
he
had
not
answered
natalia
vasilievna
s
last
had
contained
his
all
having
ended
his
speech
pavel
pavlovitch
relapsed
into
silence
and
sat
smiling
repulsively
for
a
whole
minute
or
so
why
don
t
you
answer
my
question
my
friend
he
asked
at
length
evidently
disturbed
by
velchaninoff
s
silence
what
question
as
to
the
pleasure
i
must
have
felt
as
a
fond
husband
upon
opening
the
your
feelings
are
no
business
of
mine
said
the
other
bitterly
rising
and
commencing
to
stride
up
and
down
the
room
i
wouldn
t
mind
betting
that
you
are
thinking
at
this
very
moment
what
a
pig
of
a
fellow
he
is
to
parade
his
shame
like
this
dear
me
what
a
squeamish
gentleman
you
are
to
be
sure
not
at
all
i
was
thinking
nothing
of
the
sort
on
the
contrary
i
consider
that
you
being
more
or
less
put
out
by
the
death
of
the
man
who
has
injured
you
that
you
are
not
yourself
there
s
nothing
surprising
in
it
at
all
i
quite
understand
why
you
wish
bagantoff
were
still
alive
and
am
ready
to
respect
your
annoyance
and
pray
do
you
suppose
that
i
wish
bagantoff
were
alive
oh
that
s
your
affair
i
ll
take
my
oath
you
are
thinking
of
a
duel
devil
take
it
sir
cried
velchaninoff
obliged
to
hold
himself
tighter
than
ever
i
was
thinking
that
you
like
every
respectable
person
in
similar
circumstances
would
act
openly
and
candidly
and
straightforwardly
and
not
humiliate
yourself
with
comical
antics
and
silly
grimaces
and
ridiculous
complaints
and
detestable
innuendoes
which
only
heap
greater
shame
upon
you
i
say
i
was
thinking
you
would
act
like
a
respectable
perhaps
i
am
a
respectable
person
oh
well
that
s
your
own
affair
again
and
yet
if
so
what
in
the
devil
s
name
could
you
want
with
bagantoff
alive
oh
my
dear
sir
i
should
have
liked
just
to
have
a
nice
peep
at
a
dear
old
friend
that
s
all
we
should
have
got
hold
of
a
bottle
of
wine
and
drunk
it
together
he
wouldn
t
have
drunk
with
why
not
oblige
why
are
drinking
with
me
wherein
is
he
better
than
you
i
have
not
drunk
with
wherefore
this
sudden
pride
sir
velchaninoff
suddenly
burst
into
a
fit
of
nervous
irritable
laughter
why
deuce
take
it
all
he
cried
you
are
quite
a
different
type
to
what
i
believed
i
thought
you
were
nothing
but
a
permanent
husband
but
i
find
you
are
a
sort
of
bird
of
what
permanent
husband
what
is
a
permanent
husband
asked
pavel
pavlovitch
pricking
up
his
ears
one
type
of
s
all
it
s
too
long
to
explain
come
you
d
better
get
out
now
it
s
quite
time
you
went
i
m
sick
of
you
and
bird
of
prey
sir

that
mean
i
said

were
a
bird
of
prey
for
a
yes
of
me
what
you
mean
alexey
ivanovitch
for
goodness
sake
come
come
that
s
quite
enough
shouted
velchaninoff
suddenly
flaring
up
and
speaking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
s
time
you
went
get
out
of
this
will
you
no
sir
it
s
enough
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
jumping
up
too
even
if
you
sick
of
me
sir
it
s
not
enough
for
you
must
first
drink
and
clink
glasses
with
me
i
won
t
go
before
you
do
no
no
oh
dear
no
drink

s
enough
pavel
pavlovitch
will

go
to
the
devil
or
will
you
not
with
pleasure
sir
i
ll
go
to
the
devil
with
pleasure
but
first
we
must
drink
you
say
you
don
t
wish
to
drink
but
wish
to
drink
with
pavel
pavlovitch
was
grimacing
and
giggling
no
longer
he
seemed
to
be
suddenly
transfigured
again
and
was
as
different
from
the
pavel
pavlovitch
of
but
a
few
moments
since
as
he
could
possibly
be
both
in
appearance
and
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
so
much
so
that
velchaninoff
was
absolutely
confounded
come
alexey
ivanovitch
let
s
drink
t
refuse
me
continued
pavel
pavlovitch
seizing
the
other
tightly
by
the
hand
and
gazing
into
his
face
with
an
extraordinary
expression
it
was
clear
there
was
more
in
this
matter
than
the
mere
question
of
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
well
muttered
velchaninoff
but
that
s
nothing
but
dregs
no
there
s
just
a
couple
of
glasses
s
quite
clear
now
then
clink
glasses
and
drink
there
i
ll
take
your
glass
and
you
take
they
touched
glasses
and
drank
oh
alexey
ivanovitch
now
that
we
ve
drunk
pavel
pavlovitch
suddenly
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
sat
still
for
a
few
moments
velchaninoff
trembled
with
excitement
he
thought
pavel
pavlovitch
was
about
to
disclose
but
pavel
pavlovitch
said
nothing
whatever
he
only
looked
at
him
and
quietly
smiled
his
detestable
cunning
smile
in
the
other
s
face
what
do
you
want
with
me
you
drunken
wretch
cried
velchaninoff
furious
and
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
floor
you
are
making
a
fool
of
me
don
t
shout
t
shout
why
make
such
a
noise
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
i
m
not
making
a
fool
of
you
do
you
know
what
you
are
to
me
now
and
he
suddenly
seized
velchaninoff
s
hand
and
kissed
it
before
velchaninoff
could
recollect
himself
there
that
s
what
you
are
to
me
and
now
i
ll
go
to
the
wait
a
cried
velchaninoff
recollecting
himself
there
s
something
i
wished
to
say
to
pavel
pavlovitch
turned
back
from
the
door
you
see
began
velchaninoff
blushing
and
keeping
his
eye
well
away
from
the
other
you
ought
to
go
with
me
to
the
pogoryeltseffs
to
thank
them
you
know
and
make
their
of
course
of
course
quite
so
said
pavel
pavlovitch
readily
and
making
a
gesture
of
the
hand
to
imply
that
he
knew
his
duty
and
there
was
no
need
to
remind
him
of
it
besides
liza
expects
you
promised
liza
pavel
pavlovitch
turned
quickly
once
more
upon
him
liza
do
you
know
sir
what
this
liza
has
been
to
been
and
is
he
cried
passionately
and
almost
beside
himself
shall
be
afterwards
meanwhile
it
s
not
enough
for
me
alexey
ivanovitch
that
we
have
drunk
together
there
s
another
satisfaction
i
must
have
sir
he
placed
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
panting
with
excitement
gazed
at
his
companion
with
much
the
same
expression
as
before
kiss
me
alexey
ivanovitch
are
you
drunk
cried
the
other
drawing
back
yes
i
kiss
me
all
the
same
alexey
do
i
kissed
your
hand
just
now
you
alexey
ivanovitch
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
though
stunned
by
the
blow
of
a
cudgel
then
he
quickly
bent
down
to
pavel
pavlovitch
who
was
about
the
height
of
his
shoulder
and
kissed
his
lips
from
which
proceeded
a
disagreeably
powerful
odour
of
wine
he
performed
the
action
as
though
not
quite
certain
of
what
he
was
doing
well
now
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
with
drunken
enthusiasm
and
with
his
eyes
flashing
fiercely
ll
tell
you
what
i
thought
at
that
time
surely
not
too
if
man
i
thought
if
man
is
guilty
whom
am
i
ever
to
trust
again
pavel
pavlovitch
suddenly
burst
into
tears
so
now
you
must
understand
dear
a
friend
you
are
to
me
with
these
words
he
took
his
hat
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
velchaninoff
stood
for
several
minutes
in
one
spot
just
as
he
had
done
after
pavel
pavlovitch
s
first
visit
it
s
merely
a
drunken
more
he
muttered
absolutely
nothing
further
he
repeated
when
he
was
undressed
and
settled
down
in
his
bed
chapter
viii
next
morning
while
waiting
for
pavel
pavlovitch
who
had
promised
to
be
in
good
time
in
order
to
drive
down
to
the
pogoryeltseffs
with
him
velchaninoff
walked
up
and
down
the
room
sipped
his
coffee
and
every
other
minute
reflected
upon
one
and
the
same
idea
namely
that
he
felt
like
a
man
who
had
awaked
from
sleep
with
the
deep
impression
of
having
received
a
box
on
the
ear
the
last
thing
at
night
hm
he
thought
anxiously
he
understands
the
state
of
the
case
only
too
well
he
ll
take
it
out
of
me
by
means
of
liza
the
dear
image
of
the
poor
little
girl
danced
before
his
eyes
his
heart
beat
quicker
when
he
reflected
that
a
couple
of
would
see
liza
once
more
s
no
question
about
it
he
said
to
himself
my
whole
end
and
aim
in
life
is
now
what
do
i
care
about
all
these
memories
and
boxes
on
the
ear
and
what
have
i
lived
for
up
to
now
sorrow
and
s
all
but
s
all
different
but
in
spite
of
his
ecstatic
feelings
he
grew
more
and
more
thoughtful
he
is
worrying
me
for
liza
that
s
plain
and
he
bullies
is
going
to
take
it
out
of
me
that
hm
at
all
events
i
can
not
possibly
allow
such
sallies
as
his
of
last
night
and
velchaninoff
blushed
hotly
and
here
s
eleven
and
he
hasn
t
come
he
waited
twelve
and
his
anguish
of
impatience
grew
more
and
more
keen
pavel
pavlovitch
did
not
appear
at
length
the
idea
began
to
take
shape
that
pavel
pavlovitch
naturally
would
not
come
again
for
the
sole
purpose
of
another
scene
like
that
of
last
night
the
thought
filled
velchaninoff
with
despair
the
brute
knows
i
am
depending
upon
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
now
about
liza
how
can
i
make
my
appearance
without
him
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
set
off
to
the
pokrofsky
at
one
o
clock
to
look
for
pavel
pavlovitch
at
the
lodging
velchaninoff
was
informed
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
not
been
at
home
all
night
and
had
only
called
in
at
nine
o
clock
stayed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
gone
out
again
velchaninoff
stood
at
the
door
listening
to
the
servants
report
mechanically
tried
the
handle
recollected
himself
and
asked
to
see
maria
sisevna
the
latter
obeyed
his
summons
at
once
she
was
a
old
creature
of
generous
feelings
as
velchaninoff
described
her
afterwards
to
claudia
petrovna
having
first
enquired
as
to
his
journey
yesterday
with
liza
maria
launched
into
anecdotes
of
pavel
pavlovitch
she
declared
that
she
would
long
ago
have
turned
her
lodger
out
neck
and
crop
but
for
the
child
pavel
pavlovitch
had
been
turned
out
of
the
hotel
for
generally
disreputable
behaviour
oh
he
does
dreadful
things
she
continued
fancy
his
telling
the
poor
child
in
anger
that
she
wasn
t
his
daughter
oh
no
no
impossible
cried
velchaninoff
in
alarm
i
heard
it
myself
she
s
only
a
small
child
of
course
but
that
sort
of
thing
doesn
t
do
before
an
intelligent
child
like
her
she
cried
was
quite
upset
we
had
a
catastrophe
in
the
house
a
short
while
since
some
commissionnaire
or
somebody
took
a
room
in
the
evening
and
hung
himself
before
morning
he
had
bolted
with
money
they
say
well
crowds
of
people
came
in
to
stare
at
him
pavel
pavlovitch
wasn
t
at
home
but
the
child
had
escaped
and
was
wandering
about
and
she
must
needs
go
with
the
rest
to
see
the
sight
i
saw
her
looking
at
the
suicide
with
an
extraordinary
expression
and
carried
her
off
at
once
of
course
and
fancy
i
hardly
managed
to
get
home
with
all
over
she
off
she
goes
in
a
dead
faint
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
bring
her
round
at
all
i
don
t
know
whether
she
s
epileptic
or
ever
since
that
she
has
been
ill
when
her
father
heard
he
came
and
pinched
her
all
doesn
t
beat
her
he
always
pinches
her
like
that
he
went
out
and
got
drunk
somewhere
and
came
back
and
frightened
her
i
m
going
to
hang
myself
too
he
says
because
of
you
i
shall
hang
myself
on
that
blind
string
there
he
says
and
he
makes
a
loop
in
the
string
before
her
very
eyes
the
poor
little
thing
went
quite
out
of
her
mind
with
terror
and
cried
and
clasped
him
round
with
her
little
arms
i
ll
be
ll
be
good
she
shrieks
it
was
a
pitiful
was
indeed
velchaninoff
though
prepared
for
strange
revelations
concerning
pavel
pavlovitch
and
his
ways
was
quite
dumbfounded
by
these
tales
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
maria
sisevna
told
him
many
more
such
little
anecdotes
among
others
there
was
one
occasion
when
if
she
maria
had
not
been
by
liza
would
have
thrown
herself
out
of
the
window
pavel
pavlovitch
had
come
staggering
out
of
the
room
muttering
i
shall
smash
her
head
in
with
a
stick
i
shall
murder
her
like
a
dog
and
he
had
gone
away
repeating
this
over
and
over
again
to
himself
velchaninoff
hired
a
carriage
and
set
off
towards
the
pogoryeltseffs
before
he
had
left
the
town
behind
him
the
carriage
was
delayed
by
a
block
at
a
cross
road
just
by
a
small
bridge
over
which
was
passing
at
the
moment
a
long
funeral
procession
there
were
carriages
waiting
to
move
on
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
and
a
considerable
crowd
of
foot
passengers
besides
the
funeral
was
evidently
of
some
person
of
considerable
importance
for
the
train
of
private
and
hired
vehicles
was
a
very
long
one
and
at
the
window
of
one
of
these
carriages
in
the
procession
velchaninoff
suddenly
beheld
the
face
of
pavel
pavlovitch
velchaninoff
would
not
have
believed
his
eyes
but
that
pavel
pavlovitch
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
delighted
to
have
recognised
velchaninoff
he
even
began
to
kiss
his
hand
out
of
the
window
velchaninoff
jumped
out
of
his
own
vehicle
and
in
spite
of
policemen
crowd
and
everything
else
elbowed
his
way
to
pavel
pavlovitch
s
carriage
window
he
found
the
latter
sitting
alone
what
are
you
doing
he
cried
why
didn
t
you
come
to
my
house
why
are
you
here
i
m
paying
a
debt
don
t
shout
so
i
m
repaying
a
debt
said
pavel
pavlovitch
giggling
and
winking
i
m
escorting
the
mortal
remains
of
my
dear
friend
stepan
michailovitch
bagantoff
what
absurdity
you
drunken
insane
creature
cried
velchaninoff
louder
than
ever
and
beside
himself
with
outraged
feeling
get
out
and
come
with
me
quick
get
out
instantly
i
can
t
it
s
a
i
ll
pull
you
out
then
shouted
velchaninoff
then
i
ll
scream
sir
i
ll
scream
giggled
pavel
pavlovitch
as
merrily
as
ever
just
as
though
the
whole
thing
was
a
joke
however
he
retreated
into
the
further
corner
of
the
carriage
all
the
same
look
out
sir
look
out
you
ll
be
knocked
down
cried
a
policeman
sure
enough
an
outside
carriage
was
making
its
way
on
to
the
bridge
from
the
side
stopping
the
procession
and
causing
a
commotion
velchaninoff
was
obliged
to
spring
aside
and
the
press
of
carriages
and
people
immediately
separated
him
from
pavel
pavlovitch
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
returned
to
his
own
vehicle
it
s
all
the
same
i
couldn
t
take
such
a
fellow
with
me
anyhow
he
reflected
still
all
of
a
tremble
with
excitement
and
the
rage
of
disgust
when
he
repeated
maria
sisevna
s
story
and
his
meeting
at
the
funeral
to
claudia
petrovna
afterwards
the
latter
became
buried
in
deep
thought
i
am
anxious
for
you
she
said
at
last
you
must
break
off
all
relations
with
that
man
and
as
soon
as
oh
he
s
nothing
but
a
drunken
fool
cried
velchaninoff
passionately
as
if
i
am
to
be
afraid
of
and
how
can
i
break
off
relations
with
him
remember
liza
meanwhile
liza
was
lying
ill
fever
had
set
in
last
night
and
an
eminent
doctor
was
momentarily
expected
from
town
he
had
been
sent
for
early
this
morning
these
news
quite
upset
velchaninoff
claudia
petrovna
took
him
in
to
see
the
patient
i
observed
her
very
carefully
yesterday
she
said
stopping
at
the
door
of
liza
s
room
before
entering
it
she
is
a
proud
and
morose
child
she
is
ashamed
of
being
with
us
and
of
having
been
thrown
over
by
her
father
in
my
opinion
that
is
the
whole
secret
of
her
how
thrown
over
why
do
you
suppose
that
he
has
thrown
her
over
the
simple
fact
that
he
allowed
her
to
come
here
to
a
strange
house
and
with
a
man
who
was
also
a
stranger
or
nearly
so
or
at
all
events
with
whom
his
relations
were
such
oh
but
i
took
her
myself
almost
by
liza
was
not
surprised
to
see
velchaninoff
alone
she
only
smiled
bitterly
and
turned
her
hot
face
to
the
wall
she
made
no
reply
to
his
passionate
promises
to
bring
her
father
down
without
fail
or
to
his
timid
attempts
at
consolation
as
soon
as
velchaninoff
left
the
sick
child
s
presence
he
burst
into
tears
the
doctor
did
not
arrive
until
evening
on
seeing
the
patient
he
frightened
everybody
by
his
very
first
remark
observing
that
it
was
a
pity
he
had
not
been
sent
for
before
when
informed
that
the
child
had
only
been
taken
ill
last
night
he
could
not
believe
it
at
first
well
it
all
depends
upon
how
this
night
is
passed
he
decided
at
last
having
made
all
necessary
arrangements
he
took
his
departure
promising
to
come
as
early
as
possible
next
morning
velchaninoff
was
anxious
to
stay
the
night
but
claudia
petrovna
begged
him
to
try
once
more
to
bring
down
that
brute
of
a
try
once
more
cried
velchaninoff
passionately
why
i
ll
tie
him
hand
and
foot
and
bring
him
along
myself
the
idea
that
he
would
tie
pavel
pavlovitch
up
and
carry
him
down
in
his
arms
overpowered
velchaninoff
and
filled
him
with
impatience
to
execute
his
frantic
desire
i
don
t
feel
the
slightest
bit
guilty
before
him
any
more
he
said
to
claudia
petrovna
at
parting
and
i
withdraw
all
my
servile
abject
words
of
i
said
to
you
he
added
wrathfully
liza
lay
with
closed
eyes
apparently
asleep
she
seemed
to
be
better
when
velchaninoff
bent
cautiously
over
her
in
order
to
it
were
but
the
edge
of
her
bed
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
just
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
and
whispered
take
me
away
it
was
but
a
quiet
sad
a
trace
of
yesterday
s
irritation
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
that
in
her
voice
which
betrayed
that
she
made
the
request
in
the
full
knowledge
that
it
could
not
be
assented
to
no
sooner
did
velchaninoff
in
despair
begin
to
assure
her
as
tenderly
as
he
could
that
what
she
desired
was
impossible
than
she
silently
closed
her
eyes
and
said
not
another
word
just
as
though
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
him
arrived
in
town
velchaninoff
told
his
man
to
drive
him
to
the
pokrofsky
it
was
ten
o
clock
at
night
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
at
his
lodgings
velchaninoff
waited
for
him
half
an
hour
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
in
a
state
of
feverish
impatience
maria
sisevna
assured
him
at
last
that
pavel
pavlovitch
would
not
come
in
until
the
small
hours
well
then
i
ll
return
here
before
daylight
he
said
beside
himself
with
desperation
and
he
went
home
to
his
own
rooms
what
was
his
amazement
when
on
arriving
at
the
gate
of
his
house
he
learned
from
mavra
that
yesterday
s
visitor
had
been
waiting
for
him
ever
since
before
ten
o
clock
he
s
had
some
tea
she
added
and
sent
me
for
wine
same
wine
as
yesterday
he
gave
me
the
money
to
buy
it
chapter
ix
pavel
pavlovitch
had
made
himself
very
comfortable
he
was
sitting
in
the
same
chair
as
he
had
occupied
yesterday
smoking
a
cigar
and
had
just
poured
the
fourth
and
last
tumbler
of
champagne
out
of
the
bottle
the
teapot
and
a
tumbler
of
tea
stood
on
the
table
beside
him
his
red
face
beamed
with
benevolence
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
sat
in
his
shirt
sleeves
forgive
me
dearest
of
friends
he
cried
catching
sight
of
velchaninoff
and
hastening
to
put
on
his
coat
i
took
it
off
to
make
myself
thoroughly
velchaninoff
approached
him
menacingly
you
are
not
quite
tipsy
yet
are
you
can
you
understand
what
is
said
to
you
paul
pavlovitch
became
a
little
confused
no
not
quite
i
ve
been
thinking
of
the
dear
deceased
a
bit
but
i
m
not
quite
drunk
can
you
understand
what
i
say
my
dear
sir
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
understand
very
well
then
i
shall
begin
at
once
by
telling
you
that
you
are
an
ass
sir
cried
velchaninoff
at
the
top
of
his
voice
why
if
you
begin
that
way
where
will
you
end
i
wonder
said
pavel
pavlovitch
clearly
alarmed
more
than
a
little
velchaninoff
did
not
listen
but
roared
again
your
daughter
is
is
very
ill
have
you
thrown
her
over
altogether
or
not
oh
surely
she
isn
t
dying
yet
i
tell
you
she
s
ill
very
very
what
fits
don
t
talk
nonsense
i
tell
you
she
is
very
dangerously

to
go
down
if
only
for
that
what
to
thank
your
friends
eh
to
return
thanks
for
their
hospitality
of
course
quite
so
i
well
understand
alexey
of
friends
he
suddenly
seized
velchaninoff
by
both
hands
and
added
with
intoxicated
sentiment
almost
melted
to
tears
alexey
ivanovitch
don
t
shout
at
t
shout
at
me
please
if
you
do
i
may
throw
myself
into
the
don

know
we
have
such
important
things
to
talk
over
there
s
lots
of
time
to
go
to
the
pogoryeltseffs
another
velchaninoff
did
his
best
to
restrain
his
wrath
you
are
drunk
and
therefore
i
don
t
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
he
said
sternly
i
m
ready
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
you
at
any
moment
you
the
sooner
the
better
but
first
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
take
my
own
measures
to
secure
you
you
will
sleep
here
and
i
shall
take
you
with
me
to
see
liza
i
shall
not
let
you
go
again
i
shall
bind
you
if
necessary
and
carry
you
down
myself
how
do
you
like
this
sofa
to
sleep
on
he
added
panting
and
indicating
a
wide
soft
divan
opposite
his
own
sofa
against
the
other
wall
will
do
for
me
very
well
you
shall
have
this
sofa
here
take
these
are
sheets
blankets
pillow
velchaninoff
pulled
all
these
things
out
of
a
cupboard
and
tossed
them
impatiently
to
pavel
pavlovitch
who
humbly
stood
and
received
them
now
then
make
your
bed
bustle
up
pavel
pavlovitch
laden
with
bed
clothes
had
been
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
stupid
drunken
leer
on
his
face
irresolute
but
at
velchaninoff
s
second
bidding
he
hurriedly
began
the
task
of
making
his
bed
moving
the
table
away
from
in
front
of
it
and
smoothing
a
sheet
over
the
seat
of
the
divan
velchaninoff
approached
to
help
him
he
was
more
or
less
gratified
with
his
guest
s
alarm
and
submission
now
drink
up
that
wine
and
lie
down
was
his
next
command
he
felt
that
he
order
this
man
about
he
could
not
help
himself
i
suppose
you
took
upon
yourself
to
order
this
wine
did
you
i
did
sir
i
sent
for
the
wine
alexey
ivanovitch
because
i
knew
would
not
send
out
again
well
it
s
a
good
thing
that
you
knew
that
but
i
desire
that
you
should
know
still
more
i
give
you
notice
that
i
have
taken
my
own
measures
for
the
future
i
m
not
going
to
put
up
with
any
more
of
your
oh
i
quite
understand
alexey
ivanovitch
that
that
sort
of
thing
could
only
happen
once
said
pavel
pavlovitch
giggling
feebly
at
this
reply
velchaninoff
who
had
been
marching
up
and
down
the
room
stopped
solemnly
before
pavel
pavlovitch
pavel
pavlovitch
he
said
speak
plainly
you
are
a
clever
admit
the
fact
freely
i
assure
you
you
are
going
on
a
false
track
now
speak
plainly
and
act
like
an
honest
man
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
will
answer
all
you
wish
to
pavel
pavlovitch
grinned
his
disagreeable
grin
which
always
drove
velchaninoff
wild
once
more
wait
cried
the
latter
no
humbug
now
please
i
see
through
you
i
repeat
that
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
to
reply
candidly
to
anything
you
may
like
to
ask
and
to
give
you
every
sort
of
or
even
you
please
how
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
me
since
you
are
so
very
kind
began
pavel
pavlovitch
cautiously
bending
towards
him
i
may
tell
you
that
i
am
very
much
interested
as
to
what
you
said
yesterday
about
bird
of
prey
velchaninoff
spat
on
the
ground
in
utter
despair
and
disgust
and
recommenced
his
walk
up
and
down
the
room
quicker
than
ever
no
no
alexey
ivanovitch
don
t
spurn
my
question
you
don
t
know
how
interested
i
am
in
it
i
assure
you
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
ask
you
about
it
i
know
i
m
speaking
indistinctly
but
you
ll
forgive
me
that
i
ve
read
the
expression
before
tell
me
now
was
bagantoff
a
bird
of
prey
other
thing
how
is
one
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
velchaninoff
went
on
walking
up
and
down
and
answered
nothing
for
some
minutes
the
bird
of
prey
sir
he
began
suddenly
stopping
in
front
of
pavel
pavlovitch
and
speaking
vehemently
is
the
man
who
would
poison
bagantoff
while
drinking
champagne
with
him
under
the
cloak
of
goodfellowship
as
you
did
with
me
yesterday
instead
of
escorting
his
wretched
body
to
the
burial
ground
as
you
deuce
only
knows
why
and
with
what
dirty
mean
underhand
petty
motives
which
only
recoil
upon
yourself
and
make
you
viler
than
you
already
are
yes
sir
recoil
upon
yourself
quite
so
quite
so
i
oughtn
t
to
have
gone
assented
pavel
pavlovitch
but
aren
t
you
a
the
bird
of
prey
is
not
a
man
who
goes
and
learns
his
grievance
off
by
heart
like
a
lesson
and
whines
it
about
the
place
grimacing
and
posing
and
hanging
it
round
other
people
s
necks
and
who
spends
all
his
time
in
such
pettifogging
is
it
true
you
wanted
to
hang
yourself
come
is
it
true
or
not
don
t
may
have
when
i
was
don
t
remember
you
see
alexey
ivanovitch
it
wouldn
t
be
quite
nice
for
me
to
go
poisoning
people
i
m
too
high
up
in
the
service
and
i
have
money
too
you
i
may
wish
to
marry
again
who
yes
you
d
be
sent
to
siberia
which
would
be
quite
so
though
they
say
the
penal
servitude
is
not
so
bad
as
it
was
but
you
remind
me
of
an
anecdote
alexey
ivanovitch
i
thought
of
it
in
the
carriage
and
meant
to
tell
you
afterwards
well
you
may
remember
liftsoff
at
he
came
while
you
were
there
his
younger
is
rather
a
swell
serving
at
under
the
governor
and
one
fine
day
he
happened
to
quarrel
with
colonel
golubenko
in
the
presence
of
ladies
and
of
one
lady
especially
liftsoff
considered
himself
insulted
but
concealed
his
grievance
and
meanwhile
golubenko
proposed
to
a
certain
lady
and
was
accepted
would
you
believe
it
liftsoff
made
great
friends
with
golubenko
and
even
volunteered
to
be
best
man
at
his
wedding
but
when
the
ceremony
was
all
over
and
liftsoff
approached
the
bridegroom
to
wish
him
joy
and
kiss
him
as
usual
he
took
the
opportunity
of
sticking
a
knife
into
golubenko
fancy
his
own
best
man
stuck
him
well
what
does
the
assassin
do
but
run
about
the
room
crying
oh
what
have
i
done
oh
what
have
i
done
says
he
and
throws
himself
on
everyone
s
neck
by
turns
ladies
and
all
he
starved
to
death
in
siberia
sir
one
is
a
little
sorry
for
golubenko
but
he
recovered
after
i
don
t
understand
why
you
told
me
that
story
said
velchaninoff
frowning
heavily
why
because
he
stuck
the
other
fellow
with
a
knife
giggled
pavel
pavlovitch
which
proves
that
he
was
no
type
but
an
ass
of
a
fellow
who
could
so
forget
the
ordinary
manners
of
society
as
to
hang
around
ladies
necks
and
in
the
presence
of
the
governor
yet
he
stuck
the
other
fellow
he
did
what
he
intended
to
do
that
s
all
sir
go
to
the
devil
will
and
your
miserable
miserable
humbug
yourself
yelled
velchaninoff
wild
with
rage
and
fury
and
panting
so
that
he
could
hardly
get
his
words
out
you
think
you
are
going
to
alarm
do
you
you
frightener
of
mean
low
scoundrel
you
he
had
quite
forgotten
himself
in
his
rage
pavel
pavlovitch
shuddered
all
over
his
drunkenness
seemed
to
vanish
in
an
instant
his
lips
trembled
and
shook
are
you
calling
a
scoundrel
alexey
but
velchaninoff
was
himself
again
now
i
ll
apologise
if
you
like
he
said
and
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
after
a
moment
he
added
but
only
on
condition
that
you
yourself
agree
to
speak
out
fully
and
at
in
your
place
i
should
apologise
unconditionally
alexey
very
well
so
be
it
velchaninoff
was
silent
again
for
a
while
i
apologise
he
resumed
but
admit
yourself
pavel
pavlovitch
that
i
need
not
feel
myself
in
any
way
bound
to
you
after
this
i
mean
with
regard
to
only
this
particular
all
right
why
what
is
there
to
settle
between
us
laughed
pavel
pavlovitch
without
looking
up
in
that
case
so
much
the
much
the
better
come
drink
up
your
wine
and
get
into
bed
for
i
shall
not
let
you
go
now
oh
my
mind
my
wine
muttered
pavel
pavlovitch
but
he
went
to
the
table
all
the
same
and
took
up
his
tumbler
of
champagne
which
had
long
been
poured
out
either
he
had
been
drinking
copiously
before
or
there
was
some
other
unknown
cause
at
work
but
his
hand
shook
so
as
he
drank
the
wine
that
a
quantity
of
it
was
spilled
over
his
waistcoat
and
the
floor
however
he
drank
it
all
to
the
last
drop
as
though
he
could
not
leave
the
tumbler
without
emptying
it
he
then
placed
the
empty
glass
on
the
table
approached
his
bed
sat
down
on
it
and
began
to
undress
i
think
perhaps
i
had
better
sleep
here
he
said
suddenly
with
one
boot
off
and
half
undressed
well
i
think
so
said
velchaninoff
who
was
walking
up
and
down
without
looking
at
him
pavel
pavlovitch
finished
undressing
and
lay
down
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
velchaninoff
also
got
into
bed
and
put
the
candle
out
he
soon
began
to
doze
uncomfortably
some
new
trouble
seemed
to
have
suddenly
come
over
him
and
worried
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
sensation
of
shame
that
he
could
allow
himself
to
be
worried
by
the
new
trouble
velchaninoff
was
just
falling
definitely
asleep
however
when
a
rustling
sound
awoke
him
he
immediately
glanced
at
pavel
pavlovitch
s
bed
the
room
was
quite
dark
the
blinds
being
down
and
curtains
drawn
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
lying
in
his
bed
he
seemed
to
be
sitting
on
the
side
of
it
what
s
the
matter
cried
velchaninoff
a
ghost
sir
said
pavel
pavlovitch
in
a
low
tone
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
what
what
sort
of
a
ghost
that
at
the
door
i
seemed
to
see
a
ghost
whose
ghost
asked
velchaninoff
pausing
a
minute
before
putting
the
question
natalia
vasilievna
s
velchaninoff
jumped
out
of
bed
and
walked
to
the
door
whence
he
could
see
into
the
room
opposite
across
the
passage
there
were
no
curtains
in
that
room
so
that
it
was
much
lighter
than
his
own
there
s
nothing
there
at
all
you
are
drunk
lie
down
again
he
said
and
himself
set
the
example
rolling
his
blanket
around
him
pavel
pavlovitch
said
nothing
but
lay
down
as
he
was
told
did
you
ever
see
any
ghosts
before
asked
velchaninoff
suddenly
ten
minutes
later
i
think
i
saw
one
once
said
pavel
pavlovitch
in
the
same
low
voice
after
which
there
was
silence
once
more
velchaninoff
was
not
sure
whether
he
had
been
asleep
or
not
but
an
hour
or
so
had
passed
when
suddenly
he
was
wide
awake
again
was
it
a
rustle
that
awoke
him
he
could
not
tell
but
one
thing
was
the
midst
of
the
profound
darkness
of
the
room
something
white
stood
before
him
not
quite
close
to
him
but
about
the
middle
of
the
room
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
stared
for
a
full
minute
is
that
you
pavel
pavlovitch
he
asked
his
voice
sounded
very
weak
there
was
no
reply
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
the
fact
that
someone
was
standing
there
is
that
you
pavel
pavlovitch
cried
velchaninoff
again
louder
this
time
in
fact
so
loud
that
if
the
former
had
been
asleep
in
bed
he
must
have
started
up
and
answered
but
there
was
no
reply
again
it
seemed
to
velchaninoff
that
the
white
figure
had
approached
nearer
to
him
then
something
strange
happened
something
seemed
to
let
go
within
velchaninoff
s
system
and
he
commenced
to
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
just
as
he
had
done
once
before
this
evening
in
the
wildest
and
maddest
way
possible
panting
so
that
he
could
hardly
articulate
his
words
if
ass
that
you
to
think
that
you
could
frighten
i
ll
turn
my
face
to
the
wall
and
not
look
round
once
the
whole
night
to
show
you
how
little
i
am
afraid
of
fool
like
you
stand
there
from
now
till
morning
i
despise
you
so
saying
velchaninoff
twisted
round
with
his
face
to
the
wall
rolled
his
blanket
round
him
and
lay
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
a
deathlike
stillness
supervened
did
the
ghost
stand
where
it
was
or
had
it
moved
he
could
not
tell
but
his
heart
beat
and
beat
and
least
five
minutes
went
by
and
then
not
a
couple
of
paces
from
his
bed
there
came
the
feeble
voice
of
pavel
pavlovitch
i
got
up
alexey
ivanovitch
to
look
for
a
little
water
i
couldn
t
find
any
and
was
just
going
to
look
about
nearer
your
then
why
didn
t
you
answer
when
i
called
cried
velchaninoff
angrily
after
a
minute
s
pause
i
was
frightened
you
shouted
so
you
alarmed
me
you
ll
find
a
caraffe
and
glass
over
there
on
the
little
table
light
a
oh
i
ll
find
it
without
you
ll
forgive
me
alexey
ivanovitch
for
frightening
you
so
i
felt
thirsty
so
but
velchaninoff
said
nothing
he
continued
to
lie
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
so
he
lay
all
night
without
turning
round
once
was
he
anxious
to
keep
his
word
and
show
his
contempt
for
pavel
pavlovitch
he
did
not
know
himself
why
he
did
it
his
nervous
agitation
and
perturbation
were
such
that
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
while
he
felt
quite
delirious
at
last
he
fell
asleep
and
awoke
at
past
nine
o
clock
next
morning
he
started
up
just
as
though
someone
had
struck
him
and
sat
down
on
the
side
of
his
bed
but
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
to
be
seen
his
empty
rumpled
bed
was
there
but
its
occupant
had
flown
before
daybreak
i
thought
so
cried
velchaninoff
bringing
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
smartly
to
his
forehead
chapter
x
the
doctor
s
anxiety
was
justified
liza
grew
worse
so
much
so
that
it
was
clear
she
was
far
more
seriously
ill
than
velchaninoff
and
claudia
petrovna
had
thought
the
day
before
when
the
former
arrived
in
the
morning
liza
was
still
conscious
though
burning
with
fever
he
assured
his
friend
claudia
afterwards
that
the
child
had
smiled
at
him
and
held
out
her
little
hot
hand
whether
she
actually
did
so
or
whether
he
so
much
longed
for
her
to
do
so
that
he
imagined
it
done
is
uncertain
by
the
evening
however
liza
was
quite
unconscious
and
so
she
remained
during
the
whole
of
her
illness
ten
days
after
her
removal
to
the
country
she
died
this
was
a
sad
period
for
velchaninoff
the
pogoryeltseffs
were
quite
anxious
on
his
account
he
was
with
them
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
and
during
the
last
few
days
of
the
little
one
s
illness
he
used
to
sit
all
alone
for
hours
together
in
some
corner
apparently
thinking
of
nothing
claudia
petrovna
would
attempt
to
distract
him
but
he
hardly
answered
her
and
conversation
was
clearly
painful
to
him
claudia
was
quite
surprised
that
all
this
should
affect
him
so
deeply
the
children
were
the
best
consolation
and
distraction
for
him
with
them
he
could
even
laugh
and
play
at
intervals
every
hour
at
least
he
would
rise
from
his
chair
and
creep
on
to
the
to
look
at
the
little
invalid
sometimes
he
imagined
that
she
knew
him
he
had
no
hope
for
her
of
the
family
had
any
hope
but
he
never
left
the
precincts
of
the
child
s
chamber
sitting
principally
in
the
next
room
twice
however
he
had
evinced
great
activity
of
a
sudden
he
had
jumped
up
and
started
off
for
town
where
he
had
called
upon
all
the
most
eminent
doctors
of
the
place
and
arranged
consultations
between
them
the
last
consultation
was
on
the
day
before
liza
s
death
claudia
petrovna
had
spoken
seriously
to
him
a
day
or
two
since
as
to
the
absolute
necessity
of
hunting
up
pavel
pavlovitch
trusotsky
because
in
case
of
anything
happening
to
liza
she
could
not
be
buried
without
certain
documents
from
him
velchaninoff
promised
to
write
to
him
and
did
write
a
couple
of
lines
which
he
took
to
the
pokrofsky
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
at
home
as
usual
but
he
left
the
letter
to
the
care
of
maria
sisevna
at
last
liza
a
lovely
summer
evening
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
only
then
did
velchaninoff
rouse
himself
when
the
little
one
was
laid
out
all
covered
with
flowers
and
dressed
in
a
fair
white
frock
belonging
to
one
of
claudia
petrovna
s
children
velchaninoff
came
up
to
the
lady
of
the
house
and
told
her
with
flashing
eyes
that
he
would
now
go
and
fetch
the
murderer
regardless
of
all
advice
to
put
off
his
search
until
he
started
for
town
immediately
he
knew
where
to
find
pavel
pavlovitch
he
had
not
been
in
town
exclusively
to
find
the
doctors
those
two
days
occasionally
while
watching
the
dying
child
he
had
been
struck
with
the
idea
that
if
he
could
only
find
and
bring
down
pavel
pavlovitch
she
might
hear
his
voice
and
be
called
back
as
it
were
from
the
darkness
of
delirium
at
such
moments
he
had
been
seized
with
desperation
and
twice
he
had
started
up
and
driven
wildly
off
to
town
in
order
to
find
pavel
pavlovitch
the
latter
s
room
was
the
same
as
before
but
it
was
useless
to
look
for
him
there
for
according
to
maria
sisevna
s
report
he
was
now
two
or
three
days
absent
from
home
at
a
stretch
and
was
generally
to
be
found
with
some
friends
in
the
voznecensky
arrived
in
town
about
ten
o
clock
velchaninoff
went
straight
to
these
latter
people
and
securing
the
services
of
a
member
of
the
family
to
assist
in
finding
pavel
pavlovitch
set
out
on
his
quest
he
did
not
know
what
he
should
do
with
pavel
pavlovitch
when
found
whether
he
should
kill
him
then
and
there
or
simply
inform
him
of
the
death
of
the
child
and
of
the
necessity
for
his
assistance
in
arranging
for
her
funeral
after
a
long
and
fruitless
search
velchaninoff
found
pavel
pavlovitch
quite
accidentally
he
was
quarrelling
with
some
person
in
the
as
usual
and
seemed
to
be
getting
the
worst
of
the
controversy
which
appeared
to
be
about
a
money
claim
on
catching
sight
of
velchaninoff
pavel
pavlovitch
stretched
out
his
arms
to
him
and
begged
for
help
while
his
velchaninoff
s
athletic
off
pavel
pavlovitch
shook
his
fist
after
him
triumphantly
and
hooted
at
him
with
cries
of
victory
but
this
amusement
was
brought
to
a
sudden
conclusion
by
velchaninoff
who
impelled
by
some
mysterious
he
could
not
analyse
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
began
to
shake
him
violently
so
violently
that
his
teeth
chattered
pavel
pavlovitch
ceased
to
shout
after
his
opponent
and
gazed
with
a
stupid
tipsy
expression
of
alarm
at
his
new
antagonist
velchaninoff
having
shaken
him
till
he
was
tired
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
with
him
set
him
down
violently
on
the
pavement
backwards
liza
is
dead
he
said
pavel
pavlovitch
sat
on
the
pavement
and
stared
he
was
too
far
gone
to
take
in
the
news
at
last
he
seemed
to
realize
dead
he
whispered
in
a
strange
inexplicable
tone
velchaninoff
was
not
sure
whether
his
face
was
simply
twitching
or
whether
he
was
trying
to
grin
in
his
usual
disagreeable
way
but
the
next
moment
the
drunkard
raised
his
shaking
hand
to
cross
himself
he
then
struggled
to
his
feet
and
staggered
off
appearing
totally
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
such
a
person
as
velchaninoff
existed
however
the
latter
very
soon
pursued
and
caught
him
seizing
him
once
more
by
the
shoulder
do
you
understand
you
drunken
sot
that
without
you
the
funeral
arrangements
can
not
be
made
he
shouted
panting
with
rage
pavel
pavlovitch
turned
his
head
the
t
you
remember
him
he
muttered
thickly
cried
velchaninoff
with
a
shudder
he
s
her
him
he
ll
bury
her
you
liar
you
said
that
out
of
pure
malice
i
thought
you
d
invent
something
of
the
sort
quite
beside
himself
with
passion
velchaninoff
brought
down
his
powerful
fist
with
all
his
strength
on
pavel
pavlovitch
s
head
another
moment
and
he
might
have
followed
up
the
blow
and
slain
the
man
as
he
stood
his
victim
never
winced
but
he
turned
upon
velchaninoff
a
face
of
such
insane
terrible
passion
that
his
whole
visage
looked
distorted
do
you
understand
russian
he
asked
more
firmly
as
though
his
fury
had
chased
away
the
effects
of
drunkenness
very
well
then
you
are
here
followed
a
specimen
of
the
very
vilest
language
which
the
russian
tongue
could
furnish
and
now
you
can
go
back
to
her
so
saying
he
tore
himself
from
velchaninoff
s
grasp
nearly
knocking
himself
over
with
the
effort
and
staggered
away
velchaninoff
did
not
follow
him
next
day
however
a
most
man
arrived
at
the
pogoryeltseft
s
house
in
civil
uniform
and
handed
to
claudia
petrovna
a
packet
addressed
to
her
from
pavel
pavlovitch
in
this
packet
was
a
sum
of
three
hundred
roubles
together
with
all
certificates
necessary
for
liza
s
funeral
pavel
pavlovitch
had
written
a
short
note
couched
in
very
polite
and
correct
phraseology
and
thanking
claudia
petrovna
sincerely
for
her
great
kindness
to
the
for
which
heaven
alone
could
recompense
he
added
rather
confusedly
that
severe
illness
prevented
his
personal
presence
at
the
funeral
of
his
tenderly
loved
and
unfortunate
daughter
but
that
he
felt
he
could
repose
all
confidence
as
to
the
ceremony
being
fittingly
performed
in
the
angelic
goodness
of
claudia
the
three
hundred
roubles
he
explained
were
to
go
towards
the
funeral
and
other
expenses
if
there
should
be
any
of
the
money
left
after
defraying
all
charges
claudia
petrovna
was
requested
to
spend
the
same
in
prayers
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
deceased
nothing
further
was
to
be
discovered
by
questioning
the
messenger
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
latter
knew
nothing
excepting
that
he
had
only
consented
to
act
as
bearer
of
the
packet
in
response
to
the
urgent
appeal
of
pavel
pavlovitch
pogoryeltseff
was
a
little
offended
by
the
offer
of
money
for
expenses
and
would
have
sent
it
back
but
claudia
petrovna
suggested
that
a
receipt
should
be
taken
from
the
cemetery
authorities
for
the
cost
of
the
funeral
since
one
could
not
well
refuse
to
allow
a
man
to
bury
his
own
child
together
with
a
document
undertaking
that
the
rest
of
the
three
hundred
roubles
should
be
spent
in
prayer
for
the
soul
of
liza
velchaninoff
afterwards
posted
an
envelope
containing
these
two
papers
to
trusotsky
s
lodging
after
the
funeral
velchaninoff
disappeared
from
the
country
altogether
he
wandered
about
town
for
a
whole
fortnight
knocking
up
against
people
as
he
went
blindly
through
the
streets
now
and
then
he
spent
a
whole
day
lying
in
his
bed
oblivious
of
the
most
ordinary
needs
and
occupations
the
pogoryeltseffs
often
invited
him
to
their
house
and
he
invariably
promised
to
come
and
as
invariably
forgot
all
about
it
claudia
petrovna
went
as
far
as
to
call
for
him
herself
but
she
did
not
find
him
at
home
the
same
thing
happened
with
his
lawyer
who
had
some
good
news
to
tell
him
the
difference
with
his
opponent
had
been
settled
advantageously
for
velchaninoff
the
former
having
accepted
a
small
bonification
and
renounced
his
claim
to
the
property
in
dispute
all
that
was
wanting
was
the
formal
acquiescence
of
velchaninoff
himself
finding
him
at
home
at
last
after
many
endeavours
the
lawyer
was
excessively
surprised
to
discover
that
velchaninoff
was
as
callous
and
cool
as
to
the
result
of
his
the
lawyer
s
labours
as
he
had
before
been
ardent
and
excitable
the
hottest
days
of
july
had
now
arrived
but
velchaninoff
was
oblivious
of
everything
his
grief
swelled
and
ached
at
his
heart
like
some
internal
boil
his
greatest
sorrow
was
that
liza
had
not
had
time
to
know
him
and
died
without
ever
guessing
how
fondly
he
loved
her
the
sweet
new
beacon
of
his
life
which
had
glimmered
for
a
short
while
within
his
heart
was
extinguished
once
more
and
lost
in
eternal
gloom
the
whole
object
of
his
existence
as
he
now
told
himself
at
every
moment
should
have
been
that
liza
might
feel
his
love
about
her
and
around
her
each
day
each
hour
each
moment
of
her
life
there
can
be
no
higher
aim
or
object
than
this
in
life
he
thought
in
gloomy
ecstasy
if
there
be
other
aims
in
life
none
can
be
holier
or
better
than
this
of
mine
all
my
old
unworthy
life
should
have
been
purified
and
atoned
for
by
my
love
for
liza
in
place
of
sinful
useless
should
have
bequeathed
to
the
world
a
sweet
pure
beautiful
being
in
whose
innocence
all
my
guilt
should
have
been
absorbed
and
lost
and
forgiven
and
in
her
i
should
have
forgiven
such
thoughts
would
flit
through
velchaninoff
s
head
as
he
mused
sorrowfully
over
the
memory
of
the
dead
child
he
thought
over
all
he
had
seen
of
her
he
recalled
her
little
face
all
burning
with
fever
then
lying
at
rest
in
her
coffin
covered
with
lovely
flowers
he
remembered
that
once
he
had
noticed
that
one
of
her
fingers
was
quite
black
from
some
bruise
or
knows
what
had
made
it
so
but
it
was
the
sight
of
that
little
finger
which
had
filled
him
with
longing
to
go
straight
away
and
pavel
pavlovitch
do
you
know
what
liza
is
to
me
pavel
had
said
he
recollected
one
day
and
now
he
understood
the
exclamation
it
was
no
pretence
of
love
no
posturing
and
was
real
love
how
then
could
the
wretch
have
been
so
cruel
to
a
child
whom
he
so
dearly
loved
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
the
question
was
painful
and
quite
unanswerable
one
day
he
wandered
knew
not
exactly
the
cemetery
where
liza
was
buried
and
hunted
up
her
grave
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
there
since
the
funeral
he
had
never
dared
to
go
there
before
fearing
that
the
visit
would
be
too
painful
but
strangely
enough
when
he
found
the
little
mound
and
had
bent
down
and
kissed
it
he
felt
happier
and
lighter
at
heart
than
before
it
was
a
lovely
evening
the
sun
was
setting
the
tall
grass
waved
about
the
tombs
and
a
bee
hummed
somewhere
near
him
the
flowers
and
crosses
placed
on
the
tomb
by
claudia
petrovna
were
still
there
a
ray
of
hope
blazed
up
in
his
heart
for
the
first
time
for
many
a
long
day
how
i
feel
he
thought
as
he
felt
the
spell
of
the
quiet
of
god
s
acre
and
the
hush
of
the
beautiful
still
evening
a
flow
of
some
indefinable
faith
in
something
poured
into
his
heart
this
is
liza
s
gift
he
thought
this
is
liza
herself
talking
to
me
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
left
the
cemetery
and
turned
his
steps
homewards
not
far
from
the
gate
of
the
burial
ground
there
stood
a
small
inn
or
and
through
the
open
windows
he
could
see
the
people
inside
sitting
at
tables
it
instantly
struck
velchaninoff
that
one
of
the
guests
sitting
nearest
to
the
window
was
pavel
pavlovitch
and
that
the
latter
had
seen
him
and
was
observing
him
curiously
he
went
on
further
but
before
very
long
he
heard
footsteps
pursuing
him
it
was
of
course
pavel
pavlovitch
probably
the
unusually
serene
and
peaceful
expression
of
velchaninoff
s
face
as
he
went
by
had
attracted
and
encouraged
him
he
soon
caught
velchaninoff
up
and
smiled
timidly
at
him
but
not
with
the
old
drunken
grin
he
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
smallest
degree
drunk
good
evening
said
pavel
pavlovitch
how
d
ye
do
replied
velchaninoff
chapter
xi
by
replying
thus
to
pavel
pavlovitch
s
greeting
velchaninoff
surprised
himself
it
seemed
strange
indeed
to
him
that
he
should
now
meet
this
man
without
any
feeling
of
anger
and
that
there
should
be
something
quite
novel
in
his
feelings
towards
pavel
sort
of
call
to
new
relations
with
him
what
a
lovely
evening
said
pavel
pavlovitch
looking
observantly
into
the
other
s
eyes
so
you
haven
t
gone
away
yet
murmured
velchaninoff
not
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
but
as
though
musing
upon
the
fact
as
he
continued
to
walk
on
i
ve
been
a
good
deal
delayed
but
i
ve
obtained
my
petition
my
new
post
with
rise
of
salary
i
m
off
the
day
after
for
what
you
ve
obtained
the
new
situation
and
why
not
said
pavel
pavlovitch
with
a
crooked
smile
oh
i
meant
nothing
particular
by
my
remark
said
velchaninoff
frowning
and
glancing
sidelong
at
his
companion
to
his
surprise
pavel
pavlovitch
both
in
dress
and
appearance
even
down
to
the
hat
with
the
crape
band
was
incomparably
neater
and
than
he
was
wont
to
be
a
fortnight
since
why
was
he
sitting
in
the
then
thought
velchaninoff
this
fact
puzzled
him
much
i
wished
to
let
you
know
of
my
other
great
joy
alexey
ivanovitch
resumed
pavel
joy
i
m
going
to
what
yes
sir
after
sorrow
joy
it
is
ever
thus
in
life
oh
alexey
ivanovitch
i
should
so
much
like
you
look
as
though
you
were
in
a
great
yes
i
am
in
a
hurry
and
i
am
ill
he
felt
as
though
he
would
give
anything
to
get
rid
of
the
man
the
feeling
of
readiness
to
develop
new
and
better
relations
with
him
had
vanished
in
a
moment
i
should
so
much
pavel
pavlovitch
did
not
finish
his
sentence
velchaninoff
kept
silence
and
waited
in
that
case
perhaps
another
we
should
happen
to
yes
yes
another
time
said
velchaninoff
quickly
continuing
to
move
along
and
never
looking
at
his
companion
nothing
was
said
for
another
minute
or
two
pavel
pavlovitch
continued
to
trot
alongside
in
that
case
he
blurted
at
last
revoir
i
velchaninoff
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
hear
him
complete
his
sentence
he
left
pavel
and
returned
home
much
agitated
the
meeting
with
that
fellow
had
been
too
much
for
his
present
state
of
mind
as
he
lay
down
upon
his
bed
the
thought
came
over
him
once
more
why
was
that
fellow
there
close
to
the
cemetery
he
determined
to
go
down
to
the
pogoryeltseffs
next
morning
not
that
he
felt
inclined
to
sympathy
was
intolerably
painful
to
him
they
had
been
so
kind
and
so
anxious
about
him
that
he
must
really
make
up
his
mind
to
go
but
next
day
while
finishing
his
breakfast
he
felt
terribly
disinclined
for
the
visit
he
felt
as
it
were
shy
of
meeting
them
for
the
first
time
after
his
grief
shall
i
go
or
not
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
sat
at
his
table
when
suddenly
to
his
extreme
amazement
in
walked
pavel
pavlovitch
in
spite
of
yesterday
s
velchaninoff
could
not
have
believed
that
this
man
would
ever
enter
his
rooms
again
and
when
he
now
saw
him
appear
he
gazed
at
him
in
such
absolute
astonishment
that
he
simply
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
pavel
pavlovitch
took
the
management
of
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
he
said
good
morning
and
sat
down
in
the
very
same
chair
which
he
had
occupied
on
his
last
visit
three
weeks
since
this
circumstance
reminded
velchaninoff
too
painfully
of
that
visit
and
he
glared
at
his
visitor
with
disgust
and
some
agitation
you
are
surprised
i
see
said
pavel
pavlovitch
reading
the
other
s
expression
he
seemed
to
be
both
freer
more
at
his
ease
and
yet
more
timid
than
yesterday
his
outward
appearance
was
very
curious
to
behold
for
pavel
pavlovitch
was
not
only
dressed
he
was
got
up
in
the
pink
of
fashion
he
had
on
a
neat
summer
overcoat
with
a
pair
of
light
trousers
and
a
white
waistcoat
his
gloves
his
gold
quite
a
new
acquisition
and
his
linen
were
quite
above
all
criticism
he
wafted
an
odour
of
sweet
scent
when
he
moved
he
looked
funny
but
his
appearance
awakened
strange
thoughts
besides
of
course
i
have
surprised
you
alexey
ivanovitch
he
said
twisting
himself
about
i
see
it
but
in
my
opinion
there
should
be
a
something
exalted
something
and
unattainable
by
petty
discords
or
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
between
man
and
man
don
t
you
agree
with
me
sir
pavel
pavlovitch
say
what
you
have
to
say
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
without
further
ceremony
said
velchaninoff
frowning
angrily
in
a
couple
of
words
sir
said
pavel
hurriedly
i
am
going
to
be
married
and
i
am
now
off
to
see
my
once
she
lives
in
the
country
and
what
i
desire
is
the
profound
honour
of
introducing
to
the
family
sir
in
fact
i
have
come
here
to
petition
you
sir
pavel
pavlovitch
bent
his
head
deferentially
to
beg
you
to
go
down
with
go
down
with
you
where
to
cried
the
other
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
to
their
house
in
the
country
sir
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
if
i
am
too
agitated
and
confuse
my
words
but
i
am
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
hearing
you
refuse
he
looked
at
velchaninoff
plaintively
you
wish
me
to
accompany
you
to
see
your
bride
said
velchaninoff
staring
keenly
at
pavel
pavlovitch
he
could
not
believe
either
his
eyes
or
his
ears
sir
murmured
pavel
who
had
suddenly
become
timid
to
a
painful
degree
don
t
be
angry
alexey
ivanovitch
it
is
not
my
audacity
that
prompts
me
to
ask
you
this
i
do
it
with
all
humility
and
conscious
of
the
unusual
nature
of
my
petition
thought
perhaps
you
would
not
refuse
my
humble
in
the
first
place
the
thing
is
absolutely
out
of
the
question
said
velchaninoff
turning
away
in
considerable
mental
perturbation
it
is
only
my
immeasurable
longing
that
prompts
me
to
ask
you
i
confess
i
have
a
reason
for
desiring
it
which
reason
i
propose
to
reveal
to
you
afterwards
just
now
the
thing
is
quite
impossible
however
you
may
look
at
it
you
must
admit
yourself
that
it
is
so
cried
velchaninoff
both
men
had
risen
from
their
chairs
in
the
excitement
of
the
conversation
not
at
at
all
it
is
quite
possible
sir
in
the
first
place
i
merely
propose
to
introduce
you
as
my
friend
and
in
the
second
place
you
know
the
family
already
the
zachlebnikoff
councillor
zachlebnikoff
what
how
so
cried
velchaninoff
this
was
the
very
man
whom
he
had
so
often
tried
to
find
at
home
and
whom
he
never
succeeded
in
hunting
very
lawyer
who
had
acted
for
his
adversary
in
the
late
legal
proceedings
why
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
apparently
taking
heart
at
velchaninoff
s
extreme
display
of
amazement
the
very
same
man
whom
i
saw
you
talking
to
in
the
street
one
day
when
i
watched
you
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
i
was
waiting
my
turn
to
speak
to
him
then
we
served
in
the
same
department
twelve
years
since
i
had
no
thought
of
all
this
that
day
i
saw
you
with
him
the
whole
idea
is
quite
new
and
a
week
me
why
surely
this
is
a
most
respectable
family
isn
t
it
asked
velchaninoff
naïvely
well
and
what
if
it
is
respectable
said
pavel
with
a
twist
oh
course
i
meant
nothing
but
so
far
as
i
could
judge
from
what
i
saw
they
remember
your
coming
down
cried
pavel
delightedly
i
told
them
all
sorts
of
flattering
things
about
but
look
here
how
are
you
to
marry
within
three
months
of
your
late
wife
s
death
oh
the
wedding
needn
t
be
at
once
the
wedding
can
come
off
in
nine
or
ten
months
so
that
i
shall
have
been
in
mourning
exactly
a
year
believe
me
my
dear
sir
it
s
all
most
place
fedosie
petrovitch
has
known
me
since
i
was
a
child
he
knew
my
late
wife
he
knows
how
much
income
i
have
he
knows
all
about
my
little
private
capital
and
all
about
my
new
increase
of
salary
so
that
you
see
the
whole
thing
is
a
mere
matter
of
weights
and
is
she
a
daughter
of
his
then
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
said
pavel
licking
his
lips
with
pleasure
may
i
smoke
a
cigarette
now
you
see
men
like
fedosie
petrovitch
zachlebnikoff
are
much
valued
in
the
state
but
excepting
for
a
few
perquisites
allowed
them
the
pay
is
wretched
they
live
well
enough
but
they
can
not
possibly
lay
by
money
now
imagine
this
man
has
eight
daughters
and
only
one
little
boy
if
he
were
to
die
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
wretched
little
pension
to
keep
the
lot
of
them
just
imagine
alone
for
such
a
family
eh
well
out
of
these
eight
girls
five
are
marriageable
the
eldest
is
already
a
splendid
girl
she
is
you
shall
see
her
for
yourself
the
sixth
is
a
girl
of
fifteen
still
at
school
well
all
those
five
elder
girls
have
to
be
trotted
about
and
shown
off
and
what
does
all
that
sort
of
thing
cost
the
poor
father
sir
they
must
be
married
then
suddenly
i
appear
on
the
first
probable
bridegroom
in
the
family
and
they
all
know
that
i
have
money
well
there
you
are
thing
s
pavel
pavlovitch
was
intoxicated
with
enthusiasm
are
you
engaged
to
the
eldest
the
eldest
i
am
wooing
the
sixth
girl
the
one
at
what
cried
velchaninoff
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
why
you
say
yourself
she
s
only
fifteen
years
fifteen
sir
but
she
ll
be
sixteen
in
nine
and
three
why
not
it
wouldn
t
be
quite
nice
to
make
the
engagement
public
just
yet
though
so
there
s
to
be
nothing
formal
at
present
it
s
only
a
private
arrangement
between
the
parents
and
myself
so
far
believe
me
my
dear
sir
the
whole
thing
is
regular
and
then
it
isn
t
quite
settled
yet
oh
settled
believe
me
it
s
all
as
right
and
tight
does
know
well
you
see
just
for
form
s
sake
it
is
not
actually
talked
her
i
mean
she
well
enough
oh
now
you
make
me
happy
this
once
alexey
ivanovitch
won
t
you
he
concluded
with
extreme
timidity
of
voice
and
manner
but
why
should
go
with
you
however
added
velchaninoff
impatiently
as
i
am
not
going
in
any
case
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
hear
any
reasons
you
may
adduce
for
my
accompanying
alexey
ivanovitch
oh
come
you
don
t
suppose
i
am
going
to
sit
down
in
a
carriage
with
you
alongside
and
drive
down
there
come
just
think
for
yourself
the
feeling
of
disgust
and
displeasure
which
pavel
pavlovitch
had
awakened
in
him
before
had
now
started
into
life
again
after
the
momentary
distraction
of
the
man
s
foolery
about
his
bride
he
felt
that
in
another
minute
or
two
he
might
kick
the
fellow
out
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
felt
angry
with
himself
for
some
reason
or
other
sit
down
alexey
ivanovitch
sit
down
you
shall
not
repent
it
said
pavel
pavlovitch
in
a
wheedling
voice
no
no
no
he
added
deprecating
the
impatient
gesture
which
velchaninoff
made
at
this
moment
alexey
ivanovitch
i
entreat
you
to
pause
before
you
decide
definitely
i
see
you
have
quite
misunderstood
me
i
quite
realize
that
i
am
not
for
you
nor
you
for
me
i
am
not
quite
so
absurd
as
to
be
unaware
of
that
fact
the
service
i
ask
of
you
now
shall
not
compromise
you
in
any
way
for
the
future
i
am
going
away
the
day
after
for
certain
let
this
one
day
be
an
exceptional
one
for
me
sir
i
came
to
you
founding
my
hopes
upon
the
generosity
and
nobility
of
your
heart
alexey
those
special
tender
feelings
which
may
perhaps
have
been
aroused
in
you
by
late
events
am
i
explaining
myself
clearly
sir
or
do
you
still
misunderstand
me
the
agitation
of
pavel
pavlovitch
was
increasing
with
every
moment
velchaninoff
gazed
curiously
at
him
you
ask
a
service
of
me
he
said
thoughtfully
and
insist
strongly
upon
my
performance
of
it
this
is
very
suspicious
in
my
opinion
i
must
know
the
whole
service
i
ask
is
merely
that
you
will
come
with
me
and
i
promise
when
we
return
that
i
will
lay
bare
my
heart
to
you
as
though
we
were
at
a
confessional
trust
me
this
once
alexey
ivanovitch
but
velchaninoff
still
held
out
and
the
more
obstinately
because
he
was
conscious
of
a
certain
worrying
feeling
which
he
had
had
ever
since
pavel
pavlovitch
began
to
talk
about
his
bride
whether
this
feeling
was
simple
curiosity
or
something
quite
inexplicable
he
knew
not
whatever
it
was
it
urged
him
to
agree
and
go
and
the
more
the
instinct
urged
him
the
more
he
resisted
it
he
sat
and
thought
for
a
long
time
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
while
pavel
pavlovitch
buzzed
about
him
and
continued
to
repeat
his
arguments
very
well
he
said
at
last
very
well
i
ll
he
was
agitated
almost
to
trembling
pitch
pavel
was
radiant
then
alexey
ivanovitch
change
your
up
will
you
dress
up
in
your
own
know
so
well
how
to
do
pavel
pavlovitch
danced
about
velchaninoff
as
he
dressed
his
state
of
mind
was
exuberantly
blissful
what
in
the
world
does
the
fellow
mean
by
it
all
thought
velchaninoff
i
m
going
to
ask
you
one
more
favour
yet
alexey
ivanovitch
cried
the
other
you
ve
consented
to
come
you
must
be
my
guide
sir
for
instance
how
well
for
instance
here
s
an
important
crape
which
ought
i
to
it
off
or
leave
it
on
just
as
you
no
i
want
your
opinion
what
should
you
do
yourself
if
you
were
wearing
crape
under
the
circumstances
my
own
idea
was
that
if
i
left
it
on
i
should
be
giving
a
proof
of
the
fidelity
of
my
affections
a
very
flattering
recommendation
eh
sir
oh
take
it
off
of
do
you
really
think
it
s
a
matter
of
of
course
pavel
pavlovitch
reflected
no
he
continued
do
you
know
i
think
i
d
rather
leave
it
well
do
as
you
like
he
doesn
t
trust
me
at
all
events
which
is
one
good
thing
thought
velchaninoff
they
left
the
house
at
last
pavel
looked
over
his
companion
s
smart
costume
with
intense
satisfaction
velchaninoff
was
greatly
surprised
at
pavel
s
conduct
but
not
less
so
at
his
own
at
the
gate
there
stood
a
very
superior
open
carriage
h
m
so
you
had
a
carriage
in
waiting
had
you
then
you
were
quite
convinced
that
i
would
consent
to
come
down
with
you
i
suppose
i
took
the
carriage
for
my
own
use
but
i
was
nearly
sure
you
would
come
said
pavel
pavlovitch
who
wore
the
air
of
a
man
whose
cup
of
happiness
is
full
to
the
brim
don
t
you
think
you
are
a
little
too
sanguine
in
trusting
so
much
to
my
benevolence
asked
velchaninoff
as
they
took
their
seats
and
started
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
but
his
heart
was
full
of
annoyance
well
alexey
ivanovitch
it
is
not
for
to
call
me
a
fool
for
that
replied
pavel
firmly
and
impressively
h
m
and
liza
thought
velchaninoff
but
he
chased
the
idea
away
he
felt
as
though
it
were
sacrilege
to
think
of
her
here
and
immediately
another
thought
came
in
namely
how
small
how
petty
a
creature
he
must
be
himself
to
harbour
such
a
a
mean
paltry
sentiment
in
connection
with
liza
s
sacred
name
so
angry
was
he
that
he
felt
as
though
he
must
stop
the
carriage
and
get
out
even
though
it
cost
him
a
struggle
with
pavel
pavlovitch
to
do
so
but
at
this
moment
pavel
spoke
and
the
old
feeling
of
desire
to
go
with
him
his
soul
alexey
ivanovitch
pavel
said
are
you
a
judge
of
articles
of
value
what
sort
of
articles
i
wish
to
take
down
a
present
with
me
what
do
you
think
ought
i
to
give
her
one
or
not
quite
unnecessary
i
should
but
i
wish
to
do
it
badly
the
only
thing
is
what
shall
i
give
whole
set
brooch
bracelet
and
all
or
only
one
article
how
much
do
you
wish
to
spend
oh
four
or
five
hundred
bosh
what
too
much
buy
one
bracelet
for
about
a
this
advice
depressed
pavel
pavlovitch
he
grew
wondrous
melancholy
he
was
terribly
anxious
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
buy
the
whole
set
he
insisted
upon
the
necessity
of
doing
so
a
shop
was
reached
and
entered
and
pavel
bought
a
bracelet
after
all
and
that
not
the
one
he
chose
himself
but
the
one
which
his
companion
fixed
upon
pavel
wished
to
buy
both
when
the
shopman
who
originally
asked
one
hundred
and
seventy
five
let
the
bracelet
go
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
pavel
pavlovitch
was
anything
but
pleased
he
was
most
anxious
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
the
young
lady
and
would
have
gladly
paid
two
hundred
roubles
for
the
same
goods
on
the
slightest
encouragement
it
doesn
t
matter
my
being
in
a
hurry
to
give
her
presents
does
it
he
began
excitedly
when
they
were
back
in
the
carriage
and
rolling
along
once
more
they
are
not
swells
at
all
they
live
most
simply
innocence
loves
presents
he
continued
smiling
cunningly
you
laughed
just
now
alexey
ivanovitch
when
i
said
that
the
girl
was
only
fifteen
but
you
know
what
specially
struck
me
about
her
was
that
she
still
goes
to
school
with
a
sweet
little
bag
in
her
hand
containing
copy
books
and
pencils
it
was
the
little
satchel
that
fetched
me
i
do
love
innocence
alexey
ivanovitch
i
don
t
care
half
so
much
for
good
looks
as
for
innocence
fancy
she
and
her
friend
were
sitting
in
the
corner
there
the
other
day
and
roared
with
laughter
because
the
cat
jumped
from
a
cupboard
on
to
the
sofa
and
fell
down
all
of
a
heap
why
it
smells
of
fresh
apples
that
does
sir
shall
i
take
off
the
crape
eh
do
as
you
like
well
i
ll
take
it
off
he
took
his
hat
tore
the
crape
off
and
threw
the
latter
into
the
road
velchaninoff
remarked
that
as
he
put
his
hat
on
his
bald
head
once
more
he
wore
an
expression
of
the
simplest
and
frankest
hope
and
delight
is
he
that
sort
of
man
thought
velchaninoff
with
annoyance
he
surely
be
trundling
me
down
here
without
some
underhand
he
be
trusting
entirely
to
my
generosity
this
last
idea
seemed
to
fill
him
with
indignation
what
this
clown
of
a
fellow
he
continued
to
reflect
is
he
a
fool
an
idiot
or
simply
a
permanent
husband
i
can
t
make
head
or
tail
of
it
all
chapter
xii
the
zachlebnikoffs
were
certainly
as
velchaninoff
had
expressed
it
a
most
respectable
family
zachlebnikoff
himself
was
a
most
eminently
dignified
and
solid
gentleman
to
look
at
what
pavel
pavlovitch
had
said
as
to
their
resources
was
however
quite
true
they
lived
well
but
if
paterfamilias
were
to
die
it
would
be
very
awkward
for
the
rest
old
zachlebnikoff
received
velchaninoff
most
cordially
he
was
no
longer
the
legal
opponent
he
appeared
now
in
a
far
more
agreeable
guise
i
congratulate
you
he
said
at
once
upon
the
issue
i
did
my
best
to
arrange
it
so
and
your
lawyer
was
a
capital
fellow
to
deal
with
you
have
your
sixty
thousand
without
trouble
or
worry
you
see
and
if
we
hadn
t
squared
it
we
might
have
fought
on
for
two
or
three
velchaninoff
was
introduced
to
the
lady
of
the
house
as
elderly
worn
woman
then
the
girls
began
to
troop
in
one
by
one
and
occasionally
two
together
but
somehow
there
seemed
to
be
even
more
than
velchaninoff
had
been
led
to
expect
ten
or
a
dozen
were
collected
could
not
count
them
exactly
it
turned
out
that
some
were
friends
from
the
neighbouring
houses
the
zachlebnikoffs
country
house
was
a
large
wooden
structure
of
no
particular
style
of
architecture
but
handsome
enough
and
was
possessed
of
a
fine
large
garden
there
were
however
two
or
three
other
houses
built
round
the
latter
so
that
the
garden
was
common
property
for
all
which
fact
resulted
in
great
intimacy
between
the
zachlebnikoff
girls
and
the
young
ladies
of
the
neighbouring
houses
velchaninoff
discovered
almost
from
the
first
moment
that
his
the
capacity
of
pavel
pavlovitch
s
friend
desiring
an
introduction
to
the
expected
and
looked
forward
to
as
a
solemn
and
important
occasion
being
an
expert
in
such
matters
he
very
soon
observed
that
there
was
even
more
than
this
in
his
reception
judging
from
the
extra
politeness
of
the
parents
and
by
the
exceeding
smartness
of
the
young
ladies
he
could
not
help
suspecting
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
been
improving
the
occasion
and
that
he
of
course
in
so
many
to
understand
that
velchaninoff
was
a
single
and
disconsolate
and
had
represented
him
as
likely
enough
at
any
moment
to
change
his
manner
of
living
and
set
up
an
establishment
especially
as
he
had
just
come
in
for
a
considerable
inheritance
he
thought
that
katerina
fedosievna
the
eldest
years
of
age
and
a
splendid
girl
according
to
pavel
s
rather
got
up
to
kill
from
the
look
of
her
she
was
eminent
even
among
her
sisters
for
special
elegance
of
costume
and
for
a
certain
originality
about
the
of
her
abundant
hair
the
rest
of
the
girls
all
looked
as
though
they
were
well
aware
that
velchaninoff
was
making
acquaintance
with
the
family
for
katie
and
had
come
down
to
have
a
look
at
their
looks
and
words
all
strengthened
the
impression
that
they
were
acting
with
this
supposition
in
view
as
the
day
went
on
katerina
fedosievna
was
a
fine
tall
girl
rather
plump
and
with
an
extremely
pleasing
face
she
seemed
to
be
of
a
quiet
if
not
actually
sleepy
disposition
strange
that
such
a
fine
girl
should
be
unmarried
thought
velchaninoff
as
he
watched
her
with
much
satisfaction
all
the
sisters
were
and
there
were
several
pretty
faces
among
the
friends
assembled
velchaninoff
was
much
diverted
by
the
presence
of
all
these
young
ladies
nadejda
fedosievna
the
and
bride
elect
of
pavel
pavlovitch
had
not
as
yet
condescended
to
appear
velchaninoff
awaited
her
coming
with
a
degree
of
impatience
which
surprised
and
amused
him
at
last
she
came
and
came
with
effect
too
accompanied
by
a
lively
girl
her
was
considerably
older
than
herself
and
a
very
old
friend
of
the
family
having
been
governess
in
a
neighbouring
house
for
some
years
she
was
quite
one
of
the
family
and
boasted
of
about
years
of
age
she
was
much
esteemed
by
all
the
girls
and
evidently
acted
at
present
as
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
nadia
nadejda
velchaninoff
saw
at
the
first
glance
that
all
the
girls
were
against
pavel
pavlovitch
friends
and
all
and
when
nadia
came
in
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
discover
that
she
absolutely
him
he
observed
further
that
pavel
pavlovitch
either
did
not
or
notice
this
fact
nadia
was
the
prettiest
of
all
the
little
with
an
impudent
audacious
expression
she
might
have
been
a
nihilist
from
the
independence
of
her
look
the
sly
little
creature
had
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
and
a
most
charming
smile
though
as
often
as
not
her
smile
was
more
full
of
mischief
and
wickedness
than
of
amiability
her
lips
and
teeth
were
wonders
she
was
slender
but
well
put
together
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
thoughtful
though
at
the
same
time
childish
fifteen
years
old
was
imprinted
in
every
feature
of
her
face
and
every
motion
of
her
body
it
appeared
afterwards
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
actually
seen
the
girl
for
the
first
time
with
a
little
satchel
in
her
hand
coming
back
from
school
she
had
ceased
to
carry
the
satchel
since
that
day
the
present
brought
down
by
pavel
pavlovitch
proved
a
failure
and
was
the
cause
of
a
very
painful
impression
pavel
pavlovitch
no
sooner
saw
his
bride
elect
enter
the
room
than
he
approached
her
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
he
gave
his
present
with
the
preface
that
he
offered
it
in
recognition
of
the
agreeable
sensation
experienced
by
him
at
his
last
visit
upon
the
occasion
of
nadejda
fedosievna
singing
a
certain
song
to
the
pianoforte
and
there
he
stopped
in
confusion
and
stood
before
her
lost
and
miserable
shoving
the
jeweller
s
box
into
her
hand
nadia
however
would
not
take
the
present
and
drew
her
hands
away
she
approached
her
mother
imperiously
the
latter
looked
much
put
out
and
said
aloud
i
won
t
take
it
nadia
was
blushing
with
shame
and
anger
take
it
and
say
thank
you
to
pavel
pavlovitch
for
it
said
her
father
quietly
but
firmly
he
was
very
far
from
pleased
quite
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
he
muttered
to
pavel
pavlovitch
nadia
seeing
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
took
the
case
and
as
children
do
giving
a
little
bob
down
and
then
a
bob
up
again
as
if
she
had
been
on
springs
one
of
the
sisters
came
across
to
look
at
the
present
whereupon
nadia
handed
it
over
to
her
unopened
thereby
showing
that
she
did
not
care
so
much
as
to
look
at
it
herself
the
bracelet
was
taken
out
and
handed
around
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
company
but
all
examined
it
silently
and
some
even
ironically
only
the
mother
of
the
family
muttered
that
the
bracelet
was
very
pavel
pavlovitch
would
have
been
delighted
to
see
the
earth
open
and
swallow
him
up
velchaninoff
helped
the
wretched
man
out
of
the
mess
he
suddenly
began
to
talk
loudly
and
eloquently
about
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
and
before
five
minutes
had
passed
he
had
won
the
attention
of
everyone
in
the
room
he
was
a
wonderfully
clever
society
talker
he
had
the
knack
of
putting
on
an
air
of
absolute
sincerity
and
of
impressing
his
hearers
with
the
belief
that
he
considered
them
equally
sincere
he
was
able
to
act
the
simple
careless
and
happy
young
fellow
to
perfection
he
was
a
master
of
the
art
of
interlarding
his
talk
with
occasional
flashes
of
real
wit
apparently
spontaneous
but
actually
and
very
likely
in
so
far
that
he
had
himself
made
the
joke
before
but
he
was
particularly
successful
he
felt
that
he
must
talk
on
and
talk
well
and
he
knew
that
before
many
moments
were
past
he
should
succeed
in
monopolizing
all
eyes
and
all
no
joke
should
be
laughed
at
but
his
own
and
no
voice
heard
but
his
and
sure
enough
the
spell
of
his
presence
seemed
to
produce
a
wonderful
effect
in
a
while
the
talking
and
laughter
became
general
with
velchaninoff
as
the
centre
and
motor
of
all
zachlebnikoff
s
kind
face
lighted
up
with
real
pleasure
and
katie
s
pretty
eyes
were
alight
with
absolute
fascination
while
her
whole
visage
glowed
with
delight
only
nadia
frowned
at
him
and
watched
him
keenly
from
beneath
her
dark
lashes
it
was
clear
that
she
was
prejudiced
against
him
this
last
fact
only
roused
velchaninoff
to
greater
exertions
the
mischievous
maria
nikitishna
however
as
nadia
s
ally
succeeded
in
playing
off
a
successful
piece
of
chaff
against
velchaninoff
she
pretended
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
represented
velchaninoff
as
the
friend
of
his
childhood
thereby
making
the
latter
out
to
be
some
seven
or
eight
years
older
than
he
really
was
velchaninoff
liked
the
look
of
maria
notwithstanding
pavel
pavlovitch
was
the
picture
of
perplexity
he
quite
understood
the
success
which
his
friend
was
achieving
and
at
first
he
felt
glad
and
proud
of
that
success
laughing
at
the
jokes
and
taking
a
share
of
the
conversation
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
gradually
relapsed
into
thoughtfulness
and
thence
into
fact
was
sufficiently
plain
from
the
expression
of
his
lugubrious
and
careworn
physiognomy
well
my
dear
fellow
you
are
the
sort
of
guest
one
need
not
exert
oneself
to
entertain
said
old
zachlebnikoff
at
last
rising
and
making
for
his
private
study
where
he
had
business
of
importance
awaiting
his
attention
and
i
was
led
to
believe
that
you
were
the
most
morose
of
hypochondriacs
dear
me
what
mistakes
one
does
make
about
other
people
to
be
sure
there
was
a
grand
piano
in
the
room
and
velchaninoff
suddenly
turned
to
nadia
and
remarked
you
sing
don
t
you
who
told
you
i
did
said
nadia
curtly
pavel
it
isn
t
true
i
only
sing
for
a
have
no
oh
but
i
have
no
voice
either
and
yet
i
sing
well
you
sing
to
us
first
and
then
i
ll
sing
said
nadia
with
sparkling
eyes
not
now
dinner
i
hate
music
she
added
i
m
so
sick
of
the
piano
we
have
singing
and
strumming
going
on
all
day
here
katie
is
the
only
one
of
us
all
worth
hearing
velchaninoff
immediately
attacked
katie
and
besieged
her
with
petitions
to
play
this
attention
from
him
to
her
eldest
daughter
so
pleased
mamma
that
she
flushed
up
with
satisfaction
katie
went
to
the
piano
blushing
like
a
and
evidently
much
ashamed
of
herself
for
blushing
she
played
some
little
piece
of
haydn
s
correctly
enough
but
without
much
expression
when
she
had
finished
velchaninoff
praised
the
music
s
music
generally
and
this
little
piece
in
particular
he
looked
at
katie
too
with
admiration
and
his
expression
seemed
to
say
by
jove
you
re
a
fine
girl
so
eloquent
was
his
look
that
everyone
in
the
room
was
able
to
read
it
and
especially
katie
herself
what
a
pretty
garden
you
have
said
velchaninoff
after
a
short
pause
looking
through
the
glass
doors
of
the
balcony
let
s
all
go
out
may
we
oh
yes
do
let
s
go
out
cried
several
voices
together
he
seemed
to
have
hit
upon
the
very
thing
most
desired
by
all
so
they
all
adjourned
into
the
garden
and
walked
about
there
until
and
velchaninoff
had
the
opportunity
of
making
closer
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
girls
of
the
establishment
two
or
three
young
fellows
dropped
in
from
the
neighbouring
student
a
and
another
young
fellow
of
about
twenty
in
a
pair
of
huge
spectacles
each
of
these
young
fellows
immediately
attached
himself
to
the
particular
young
lady
of
his
choice
the
young
man
in
spectacles
no
sooner
arrived
than
he
went
aside
with
nadia
and
maria
nikitishna
and
entered
into
an
animated
whispering
conversation
with
them
with
much
frowning
and
impatience
of
manner
this
gentleman
seemed
to
consider
it
his
mission
to
treat
pavel
pavlovitch
with
the
most
ineffable
contempt
some
of
the
girls
proposed
a
game
one
of
them
suggested
proverbs
but
it
was
voted
dull
another
suggested
acting
but
the
objection
was
made
that
they
never
knew
how
to
finish
off
it
may
be
more
successful
with
you
said
nadia
to
velchaninoff
confidentially
you
know
we
all
thought
you
were
pavel
pavlovitch
s
friend
but
it
appears
that
he
was
only
boasting
i
am
glad
you
have
a
certain
reason
she
added
looking
knowingly
into
velchaninoff
s
face
and
then
retreating
back
again
to
maria
s
wing
blushing
we
ll
play
proverbs
in
the
evening
said
another
and
we
ll
all
chaff
pavel
pavlovitch
must
help
us
too
we
so
glad
you
re
s
so
dull
here
as
a
rule
said
a
third
a
girl
whose
face
was
comically
hot
with
running
apparently
goodness
knows
where
she
had
dropped
from
velchaninoff
had
not
observed
her
arrive
pavel
pavlovitch
s
agitation
increased
every
moment
meanwhile
velchaninoff
took
the
opportunity
of
making
great
friends
with
nadia
she
had
ceased
to
frown
at
him
as
before
and
had
now
developed
the
wildest
of
spirits
dancing
and
jumping
about
singing
and
whistling
and
occasionally
even
catching
hold
of
his
hand
in
her
innocent
friendliness
she
was
very
happy
indeed
apparently
but
she
took
no
more
notice
of
pavel
pavlovitch
than
if
he
had
not
been
there
at
all
pavel
pavlovitch
was
very
jealous
of
all
this
and
once
or
twice
when
nadia
and
velchaninoff
talked
apart
he
joined
them
and
rudely
interrupted
their
conversation
by
interposing
his
anxious
face
between
them
katia
could
not
help
being
fully
aware
by
this
time
that
their
charming
guest
had
not
come
in
for
her
sake
as
had
been
believed
by
the
family
indeed
it
was
clear
that
nadia
interested
him
so
much
that
she
excluded
everyone
else
to
a
considerable
extent
from
his
attention
however
in
spite
of
this
her
face
retained
its
amiability
of
expression
all
the
same
she
seemed
to
be
happy
enough
witnessing
the
happiness
of
the
rest
and
listening
to
the
merry
talk
she
could
not
take
a
large
share
in
the
conversation
herself
poor
girl
what
a
fine
girl
your
sister
katerina
fedosievna
is
remarked
velchaninoff
to
nadia
katia
i
should
think
so
there
is
no
better
girl
in
the
world
she
s
our
family
angel
i
m
in
love
with
her
myself
replied
nadia
enthusiastically
at
last
dinner
was
announced
and
a
very
good
dinner
it
was
several
courses
being
added
for
the
benefit
of
the
guests
a
bottle
of
tokay
made
its
appearance
and
champagne
was
handed
round
in
honour
of
the
occasion
the
good
humour
of
the
company
was
general
old
zachlebnikoff
was
in
high
spirits
having
partaken
of
an
extra
glass
of
wine
this
evening
so
infectious
was
the
hilarity
that
even
pavel
pavlovitch
took
heart
of
grace
and
made
a
pun
from
the
end
of
the
table
where
he
sat
beside
the
lady
of
the
house
there
suddenly
came
a
loud
laugh
from
the
delighted
girls
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
hear
the
virgin
attempt
papa
papa
pavel
pavlovitch
has
made
a
joke
cried
several
at
once
he
says
that
there
is
quite
a
galaxy
of
gals
here
oho
made
a
pun
too
has
he
cried
the
old
fellow
well
what
is
it
let
s
have
it
he
turned
to
pavel
pavlovitch
with
beaming
face
prepared
to
roar
over
the
latter
s
joke
why
i
tell
you
he
says
there
s
quite
a
galaxy
of
well
go
on
where
s
the
joke
repeated
papa
still
dense
to
the
merits
of
the
pun
but
beaming
more
and
more
with
benevolent
desire
to
see
it
oh
papa
how
stupid
you
are
not
to
see
it
why
gals
and
galaxy
don
t
you
see
says
there
s
quite
a
of
gals
oh
oh
guffawed
the
old
gentleman
well
we
ll
hope
he
ll
make
a
better
one
next
time
that
s
pavel
pavlovitch
can
t
acquire
all
the
perfections
at
once
said
maria
nikitishna
oh
my
goodness
he
s
swallowed
a
she
added
jumping
up
from
her
chair
the
alarm
was
general
and
maria
s
delight
was
great
poor
pavel
pavlovitch
had
only
choked
over
a
glass
of
wine
which
he
seized
and
drank
to
hide
his
confusion
but
maria
declared
that
it
was
a
she
had
seen
it
herself
and
that
people
had
been
known
to
die
of
swallowing
a
bone
just
like
that
clap
him
on
the
back
cried
somebody
it
appeared
that
there
were
numerous
kind
friends
ready
to
perform
this
friendly
office
and
poor
pavel
protested
in
vain
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
common
choke
the
belabouring
went
on
until
the
coughing
fit
was
over
and
it
became
evident
that
mischievous
maria
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
after
dinner
old
zachlebnikoff
retired
for
his
nap
bidding
the
young
people
enjoy
themselves
in
the
garden
as
best
they
might
you
enjoy
yourself
too
he
added
to
pavel
pavlovitch
tapping
the
latter
s
shoulder
affably
as
he
went
by
when
the
party
were
all
collected
in
the
garden
once
more
pavel
suddenly
approached
velchaninoff
one
moment
he
whispered
pulling
the
latter
by
the
the
two
men
went
aside
into
a
lonely
none
of
that
please
i
won
t
allow
it
here
said
pavel
pavlovitch
in
a
choking
whisper
none
of
what
who
asked
velchaninoff
staring
with
all
his
eyes
pavel
pavlovitch
said
nothing
more
but
gazed
furiously
at
his
companion
his
lips
trembling
in
a
desperate
attempt
at
a
pretended
smile
at
this
moment
the
voices
of
several
of
the
girls
broke
in
upon
them
calling
them
to
some
game
velchaninoff
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
party
pavel
followed
him
i
m
sure
pavel
pavlovitch
was
borrowing
a
handkerchief
from
you
wasn
t
he
he
forgot
his
handkerchief
last
time
too
pavel
pavlovitch
has
forgotten
his
handkerchief
again
and
he
has
a
cold
as
usual
cried
maria
oh
pavel
pavlovitch
why
didn
t
you
say
so
cried
zachlebnikoff
making
towards
the
house
you
shall
have
one
at
in
vain
poor
pavel
protested
that
he
had
two
of
those
necessary
articles
and
was
suffering
from
a
cold
zachlebnikoff
was
glad
of
the
excuse
for
retiring
to
the
house
and
heard
nothing
a
few
moments
afterwards
a
maid
pursued
pavel
with
a
handkerchief
to
the
confusion
of
the
latter
gentleman
a
game
of
proverbs
was
now
proposed
all
sat
down
and
the
young
man
with
spectacles
was
made
to
retire
to
a
considerable
distance
and
wait
there
with
his
nose
close
up
against
the
wall
and
his
back
turned
until
the
proverb
should
have
been
chosen
and
the
words
arranged
velchaninoff
was
the
next
in
turn
to
be
the
questioner
then
the
cry
arose
for
pavel
pavlovitch
and
the
latter
who
had
more
or
less
recovered
his
good
humour
by
this
time
proceeded
to
the
spot
indicated
and
resolved
to
do
his
duty
like
a
man
took
his
stand
with
his
nose
to
the
wall
ready
to
stay
there
motionless
until
called
the
young
lady
was
detailed
to
watch
him
in
case
of
fraud
on
his
part
no
sooner
however
had
the
wretched
pavel
taken
up
his
position
at
the
wall
than
the
whole
party
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
run
quick
whispered
the
girls
to
velchaninoff
in
despair
for
he
had
not
started
with
them
why
what
s
happened
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
latter
keeping
up
as
best
he
could
don
t
make
a
noise
we
want
to
get
away
and
let
him
go
on
standing
s
katia
it
appeared
did
not
like
this
practical
joke
when
the
last
stragglers
of
the
party
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
garden
among
them
velchaninoff
the
latter
found
katia
angrily
scolding
the
rest
of
the
girls
very
well
she
was
saying
i
won
t
tell
mother
this
time
but
i
shall
go
away
myself
it
s
too
bad
what
will
the
poor
fellow
s
feelings
be
standing
all
alone
there
and
finding
us
fled
and
off
she
went
the
rest
however
were
entirely
unsympathizing
and
enjoyed
the
joke
thoroughly
velchaninoff
was
entreated
to
appear
entirely
unconscious
when
pavel
pavlovitch
should
appear
again
just
as
though
nothing
whatever
had
happened
it
was
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
before
pavel
put
in
an
appearance
two
thirds
at
least
of
that
time
he
must
have
stood
at
the
wall
when
he
reached
the
party
he
found
everyone
busy
over
a
game
of
laughing
and
shouting
and
making
themselves
thoroughly
happy
wild
with
rage
pavel
pavlovitch
again
made
straight
for
velchaninoff
and
tugged
him
by
the
one
moment
sir
oh
my
goodness
he
s
always
coming
in
with
his
one
moments
said
someone
a
handkerchief
wanted
again
probably
shouted
someone
else
after
the
pair
as
they
retired
come
now
this
time
it
was
you
you
were
the
originator
of
this
insult
muttered
pavel
his
teeth
chattering
with
fury
velchaninoff
interrupted
him
and
strongly
recommended
pavel
to
bestir
himself
to
be
merrier
you
are
chaffed
because
you
get
angry
he
said
if
you
try
to
be
jolly
instead
of
sulky
you
ll
be
let
alone
to
his
surprise
these
words
impressed
pavel
deeply
he
was
quiet
at
once
and
returned
to
the
party
with
a
guilty
air
and
immediately
began
to
take
part
in
the
games
engaged
in
once
more
he
was
not
further
bullied
at
present
and
within
half
an
hour
his
good
humour
seemed
quite
to
velchaninoff
s
astonishment
however
he
never
seemed
to
presume
to
speak
to
nadia
although
he
kept
as
close
to
her
on
all
occasions
as
he
possibly
could
he
seemed
to
take
his
position
as
quite
natural
and
was
not
put
out
by
her
contemptuous
air
towards
him
pavel
pavlovitch
was
teased
once
more
however
before
the
evening
ended
a
game
of
was
commenced
and
pavel
had
hidden
in
a
small
room
in
the
house
being
observed
entering
there
by
someone
he
was
locked
in
and
left
there
raging
for
an
hour
meanwhile
velchaninoff
learned
the
special
reason
for
nadia
s
joy
at
his
arrival
maria
conducted
him
to
a
lonely
alley
where
nadia
was
awaiting
him
alone
i
have
quite
convinced
myself
began
the
latter
when
they
were
left
alone
that
you
are
not
nearly
so
great
a
friend
of
pavel
pavlovitch
as
he
gave
us
to
understand
i
have
also
convinced
myself
that
you
alone
can
perform
a
certain
great
service
for
me
here
is
his
horrid
bracelet
she
drew
the
case
out
of
her
pocket
i
wish
to
ask
you
to
be
so
kind
as
to
return
it
to
him
i
can
not
do
so
myself
because
i
am
quite
determined
never
to
speak
to
him
again
all
my
life
you
can
tell
him
so
from
me
and
better
add
that
he
is
not
to
worry
me
with
any
more
of
his
nasty
presents
i
ll
let
him
know
something
else
i
have
to
say
through
other
channels
will
you
do
this
for
me
oh
for
goodness
sake
spare
me
cried
velchaninoff
almost
wringing
his
hands
how
spare
you
cried
poor
nadia
her
artificial
tone
put
on
for
the
occasion
had
collapsed
at
once
before
this
check
and
she
was
nearly
crying
velchaninoff
burst
out
laughing
i
don
t
should
be
delighted
you
the
thing
is
i
have
my
own
accounts
to
settle
with
him
i
knew
you
weren
t
his
friend
and
that
he
was
lying
i
shall
never
marry
you
may
rely
on
that
i
don
t
understand
how
he
could
all
events
you
really
give
him
back
this
horrid
bracelet
what
am
i
to
do
if
you
don
t
i
have
it
given
back
to
him
this
very
day
he
ll
catch
it
if
he
interferes
with
father
about
me
at
this
moment
the
spectacled
young
gentleman
issued
from
the
shrubs
at
their
elbow
you
are
bound
to
return
the
bracelet
he
burst
out
furiously
upon
velchaninoff
if
only
out
of
respect
to
the
rights
of
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
nadia
pulled
him
away
from
beside
velchaninoff
with
all
her
strength
how
stupid
you
are
she
cried
go
away
how
dare
you
listen
i
told
you
to
stand
a
long
way
off
she
stamped
her
foot
with
rage
and
for
some
while
after
the
young
fellow
had
slunk
away
she
continued
to
walk
along
with
flashing
eyes
furious
with
indignation
you
wouldn
t
believe
how
stupid
he
is
she
cried
at
last
you
laugh
but
think
of
my
feelings
that
s
not
is
it
laughed
velchaninoff
of
course
not
how
could
you
imagine
such
a
thing
it
s
only
his
friend
and
how
he
can
choose
such
friends
i
can
t
understand
they
say
he
is
a
future
but
i
don
t
see
it
alexey
ivanovitch
for
the
last
have
no
one
else
to
you
give
the
bracelet
back
or
not
very
well
i
will
give
it
to
me
oh
you
dear
good
alexey
ivanovitch
thanks
she
cried
enthusiastic
with
delight
i
ll
sing
all
the
evening
for
that
i
sing
beautifully
you
know
i
was
telling
you
a
wicked
story
before
dinner
oh
i
you
would
come
down
here
again
i
d
tell
you
then
and
lots
of
other
things
you
are
a
dear
kind
good
fellow
katia
and
sure
enough
when
they
reached
home
she
sat
down
and
sang
a
couple
of
songs
in
a
voice
which
though
entirely
untrained
was
of
great
natural
sweetness
and
considerable
strength
when
the
party
returned
from
the
garden
they
had
found
pavel
pavlovitch
drinking
tea
with
the
old
folks
on
the
balcony
he
had
probably
been
talking
on
serious
topics
as
he
was
to
take
his
departure
the
day
after
for
nine
months
he
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
velchaninoff
and
the
rest
when
they
entered
but
he
evidently
had
not
complained
to
the
authorities
and
all
was
quiet
as
yet
but
when
nadia
began
to
sing
he
came
in
nadia
did
not
answer
a
single
one
of
his
questions
but
he
did
not
seem
offended
by
this
and
took
his
stand
behind
her
chair
once
there
his
whole
appearance
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
that
was
his
own
place
by
right
and
that
he
allowed
none
to
dispute
it
it
s
alexey
ivanovitch
s
turn
to
sing
now
cried
the
girls
when
nadia
s
song
was
finished
and
all
crowded
round
to
hear
velchaninoff
who
sat
down
to
accompany
himself
he
chose
a
song
of
glinke
s
too
much
neglected
nowadays
it
ran
when
from
your
merry
lips
tenderness
flows
velchaninoff
seemed
to
address
the
words
to
nadia
exclusively
but
the
whole
party
stood
around
him
his
voice
had
long
since
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
but
it
was
clear
that
he
must
have
had
a
good
one
once
and
it
so
happened
that
velchaninoff
had
heard
this
particular
song
many
years
ago
from
glinkes
own
lips
when
a
student
at
the
university
and
remembered
the
great
effect
that
it
had
made
upon
him
when
he
first
heard
it
the
song
was
full
of
the
most
intense
passion
of
expression
and
velchaninoff
sang
it
well
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
nadia
amid
the
applause
that
followed
the
completion
of
the
performance
pavel
pavlovitch
came
forward
seized
nadia
s
hand
and
drew
her
away
from
the
proximity
of
velchaninoff
he
then
returned
to
the
latter
at
the
piano
and
with
every
evidence
of
frantic
rage
whispered
to
him
his
lips
all
of
a
tremble
one
moment
with
you
velchaninoff
seeing
that
the
man
was
capable
of
worse
things
in
his
then
frame
of
mind
took
pavel
s
hand
and
led
him
out
through
the
balcony
into
the
dark
now
do
you
understand
sir
that
you
must
come
away
at
very
said
pavel
pavlovitch
no
sir
i
do
not
do
you
remember
continued
pavel
in
his
frenzied
whisper
do
you
remember
that
you
begged
me
to
tell
you
to
the
smallest
details
well
the
time
has
come
for
telling
you
velchaninoff
considered
a
moment
glanced
once
more
at
pavel
pavlovitch
and
consented
to
go
oh
stay
and
have
another
cup
of
tea
said
zachlebnikoff
when
this
decision
was
announced
pavel
pavlovitch
why
are
you
taking
alexey
ivanovitch
away
cried
the
girls
with
angry
looks
as
for
nadia
she
looked
so
cross
with
pavel
that
the
latter
felt
absolutely
uncomfortable
but
he
did
not
give
in
oh
but
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
pavel
pavlovitch
said
velchaninoff
for
reminding
me
of
some
most
important
business
which
i
must
attend
to
this
very
evening
and
which
i
might
have
forgotten
laughed
velchaninoff
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
host
and
made
his
bow
to
the
ladies
especially
to
katia
as
the
family
thought
you
must
come
again
soon
said
the
host
we
have
been
so
glad
to
see
you
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
come
yes
glad
said
the
lady
of
the
house
do
come
again
soon
cried
the
girls
as
pavel
pavlovitch
and
velchaninoff
took
their
seats
in
the
carriage
alexey
ivanovitch
come
back
soon
and
with
these
voices
in
their
ears
they
drove
away
chapter
xiii
in
spite
of
velchaninoff
s
apparently
happy
day
the
feeling
of
annoyance
and
suffering
at
his
heart
had
hardly
actually
left
him
for
a
single
moment
before
he
sang
the
song
he
had
not
known
what
to
do
with
himself
or
suppressed
anger
and
that
was
the
reason
why
he
had
sung
with
so
much
feeling
and
passion
to
think
that
i
could
so
have
lowered
myself
as
to
forget
everything
he
then
despised
himself
for
thinking
it
it
is
more
humiliating
still
to
cry
over
what
is
done
he
continued
far
better
to
fly
into
a
passion
with
someone
fool
he
askance
at
pavel
pavlovitch
who
sat
beside
him
as
still
as
a
mouse
pavel
pavlovitch
preserved
a
most
obstinate
concentrating
and
ranging
his
energies
he
occasionally
took
his
hat
off
impatiently
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
once
spoke
to
the
coachman
he
asked
whether
there
was
going
to
be
a
wheugh
said
the
man
i
should
think
so
it
s
been
a
steamy
the
day
for
it
by
the
time
town
was
whole
sky
was
overcast
i
am
coming
to
your
house
said
pavel
to
velchaninoff
when
almost
at
the
door
quite
so
but
i
warn
you
i
feel
very
unwell
all
won
t
stay
too
when
the
two
men
passed
under
the
gateway
pavel
pavlovitch
disappeared
into
the
dvornik
s
room
for
a
minute
to
speak
to
mavra
what
did
you
go
in
there
for
asked
velchaninoff
severely
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
and
reached
his
own
door
at
all
to
tell
them
about
the
very
well
mind
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
drink
pavel
pavlovitch
did
not
answer
velchaninoff
lit
a
candle
while
pavel
threw
himself
into
a
chair
the
former
came
and
stood
menacingly
before
him
i
may
have
told
you
i
should
have
last
word
to
say
as
well
as
you
he
said
with
suppressed
anger
in
his
voice
and
manner
here
it
is
i
consider
conscientiously
that
things
are
square
between
you
and
me
now
and
therefore
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
understand
me
about
since
this
is
so
had
you
not
better
go
and
let
me
close
the
door
after
you
let
s
cry
quits
first
alexey
ivanovitch
said
pavel
pavlovitch
gazing
into
velchaninoff
s
eyes
with
great
sweetness
quits
cried
the
latter
in
amazement
you
strange
man
what
are
we
to
cry
quits
about
are
you
harping
upon
your
promise
of
a
last
word
oh
well
we
have
nothing
more
to
cry
quits
for
we
have
been
quits
long
since
said
velchaninoff
dear
me
do
you
really
think
so
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
in
a
shrill
sharp
voice
pressing
his
two
hands
tightly
together
finger
to
finger
as
he
held
them
up
before
his
breast
velchaninoff
said
nothing
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
the
word
liza
resounded
through
and
through
his
soul
like
the
voice
of
a
bell
well
what
is
there
that
you
still
consider
unsettled
between
us
he
asked
at
last
looking
angrily
at
pavel
who
had
never
ceased
to
follow
him
with
his
holding
his
hands
before
his
breast
finger
tip
to
finger
tip
don
t
go
down
there
any
more
said
pavel
almost
in
a
whisper
and
rising
from
his
seat
with
every
indication
of
humble
entreaty
is
all
cried
velchaninoff
bursting
into
an
angry
laugh
good
heavens
man
you
have
done
nothing
but
surprise
me
all
he
had
begun
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
but
he
now
abruptly
changed
both
voice
and
expression
and
continued
with
an
air
of
deep
feeling
listen
he
said
listen
to
me
i
don
t
think
i
have
ever
felt
so
deeply
humiliated
as
i
am
feeling
now
in
consequence
of
the
events
of
in
the
first
place
that
i
should
have
condescended
to
go
down
with
you
at
all
and
in
the
second
place
all
that
happened
there
it
has
been
such
a
day
of
pettifogging
i
have
profaned
and
lowered
myself
by
taking
a
share
in
it
all
and
it
s
done
now
but
look
fell
upon
me
a
sick
man
oh
you
needn
t
excuse
yourself
at
all
events
i
shall
certainly
go
there
again
i
have
not
the
slightest
interest
in
so
doing
he
concluded
with
an
air
of
decision
no
really
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
making
no
secret
of
his
delight
and
exultation
velchaninoff
glanced
contemptuously
at
him
and
recommenced
his
march
up
and
down
the
room
you
have
determined
to
be
happy
under
any
circumstances
i
suppose
he
observed
after
a
pause
he
could
not
resist
making
the
remark
disdainfully
yes
i
have
said
pavel
quietly
it
s
no
business
of
mine
that
he
s
a
fool
and
a
knave
out
of
pure
idiocy
thought
velchaninoff
i
can
t
help
hating
him
though
i
feel
that
he
is
not
even
worth
i
m
a
permanent
husband
said
pavel
pavlovitch
with
the
most
exquisitely
servile
irony
at
his
own
expense
i
remember
you
using
that
expression
alexey
ivanovitch
long
ago
when
you
were
with
us
at
i
remember
many
of
your
original
phrases
of
that
time
and
when
you
spoke
of
permanent
husbands
the
other
day
i
recollected
the
at
this
point
mavra
entered
the
room
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
two
glasses
forgive
me
alexey
ivanovitch
said
pavel
you
know
i
can
t
get
on
without
it
don
t
consider
it
an
audacity
on
my
of
it
as
a
mere
bit
of
unworthy
your
well
consented
velchaninoff
with
a
look
of
disgust
but
i
must
remind
you
that
i
don
t
feel
well
and
one
little
ll
go
at
once
i
really
just
drink
glass
my
throat
is
he
seized
the
bottle
eagerly
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
drank
it
greedily
at
a
gulp
and
sat
down
he
looked
at
velchaninoff
almost
tenderly
what
a
nasty
looking
beast
muttered
the
latter
to
himself
it
s
all
her
friends
that
make
her
like
that
said
pavel
suddenly
with
animation
what
oh
you
refer
to
the
lady
and
besides
she
is
so
very
young
still
you
see
resumed
pavel
i
shall
be
her
shall
see
a
little
society
and
a
bit
of
the
world
she
will
change
sir
i
mustn
t
forget
to
give
him
back
the
bracelet
thought
velchaninoff
frowning
as
he
felt
for
the
case
in
his
coat
pocket
you
said
just
now
that
i
am
determined
to
be
happy
alexey
ivanovitch
continued
pavel
confidentially
and
with
almost
touching
earnestness
i
marry
else
what
will
become
of
me
you
see
for
yourself
he
pointed
to
the
bottle
and
that
s
only
a
hundredth
part
of
what
i
demean
myself
to
nowadays
i
can
not
get
on
without
marrying
again
sir
i
have
a
new
faith
if
i
can
but
believe
in
some
one
again
sir
i
shall
shall
be
why
are
you
telling
all
this
exclaimed
velchaninoff
very
nearly
laughing
in
his
face
it
seemed
so
absurdly
inconsistent
look
here
he
continued
roaring
the
words
out
let
me
know
now
once
for
all
why
did
you
drag
me
down
there
what
good
was
i
to
do
you
there
wished
to
began
pavel
with
some
confusion
try
what
the
effect
sir
you
see
alexey
ivanovitch
i
have
only
been
visiting
there
a
week
he
grew
more
and
more
confused
and
yesterday
when
i
met
you
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
had
never
seen
her
yet
in
society
that
is
in
the
society
of
other
besides
stupid
idea
i
know
it
was
very
anxious
to
know
my
wretchedly
jealous
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
and
blushed
violently
he
be
telling
me
the
truth
thought
velchaninoff
he
was
struck
dumb
with
surprise
well
go
on
he
muttered
at
last
well
i
see
it
was
all
her
pretty
childish
nature
and
her
friends
together
you
must
forgive
my
stupid
conduct
towards
yourself
alexey
ivanovitch
i
will
never
do
it
again
sir
i
assure
you
i
shall
never
be
there
to
give
you
the
opportunity
replied
velchaninoff
with
a
laugh
that
s
partly
why
i
say
it
said
pavel
oh
come
i
m
not
the
only
man
in
the
world
you
know
said
the
other
irritably
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
alexey
ivanovitch
my
esteem
for
nadejda
is
such
that
oh
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
meant
nothing
i
assure
you
only
it
surprises
me
that
you
should
have
expected
so
much
of
you
trusted
me
so
i
trusted
you
entirely
sir
solely
on
account
that
has
so
that
you
still
consider
me
the
most
honourable
of
men
velchaninoff
paused
the
naïve
nature
of
his
sudden
question
surprised
even
himself
i
always
did
think
you
that
sir
said
pavel
hanging
his
head
of
course
quite
didn
t
mean
quite
wanted
to
say
in
spite
of
all
prejudices
you
may
have
formed
yes
in
spite
of
all
prejudices
and
when
you
first
came
to
petersburg
asked
velchaninoff
who
himself
felt
the
monstrosity
of
his
own
inquisitive
questions
but
could
not
resist
putting
them
i
considered
you
the
most
honourable
of
men
when
i
first
came
to
petersburg
sir
no
less
i
always
respected
you
alexey
ivanovitch
pavel
pavlovitch
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
his
companion
without
the
smallest
trace
of
confusion
velchaninoff
suddenly
felt
cowed
and
afraid
he
was
anxious
that
nothing
should
this
conversation
since
he
himself
was
responsible
for
having
initiated
it
i
loved
you
alexey
ivanovitch
all
that
year
at
i
loved
did
not
observe
it
continued
pavel
pavlovitch
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
his
companion
you
did
not
observe
my
affection
because
i
was
too
lowly
a
being
to
deserve
any
sort
of
notice
but
it
was
unnecessary
that
you
should
observe
my
love
well
sir
and
all
these
nine
years
i
have
thought
of
you
for
i
have
never
known
such
a
year
of
life
as
that
year
pavel
s
eyes
seemed
to
have
a
special
glare
in
them
at
this
point
i
remembered
many
of
your
sayings
and
expressions
sir
and
i
thought
of
you
always
as
a
man
imbued
with
the
loftiest
sentiments
and
gifted
with
knowledge
and
intellect
the
highest
man
of
grand
ideas
great
ideas
do
not
proceed
so
frequently
from
greatness
of
intellect
as
from
elevation
of
taste
and
you
yourself
said
that
sir
once
i
dare
say
you
have
forgotten
the
fact
but
you
did
say
it
therefore
i
always
thought
of
you
sir
as
a
man
of
taste
and
feeling
consequently
i
i
trusted
you
in
spite
of
pavel
pavlovitch
s
chin
suddenly
began
to
tremble
velchaninoff
was
frightened
out
of
his
wits
this
unexpected
tone
must
be
put
an
end
to
at
all
hazards
enough
pavel
pavlovitch
he
said
softly
blushing
violently
and
with
some
show
of
irritation
and
velchaninoff
suddenly
began
to
shout
passionately
do
you
come
hanging
round
the
neck
of
a
sick
man
a
worried
man
who
is
almost
out
of
his
wits
with
fever
and
annoyance
of
all
sorts
and
drag
him
into
this
abyss
of
lies
and
mirage
and
vision
and
unnatural
disproportionate
distorted
nonsense
yes
sir
that
s
the
most
shameful
part
of
the
whole
disproportionate
nonsense
of
what
you
say
you
know
it
s
all
humbug
both
of
us
are
mean
of
us
and
if
you
like
i
ll
prove
to
you
at
once
that
not
only
you
don
t
love
me
but
that
you
loathe
and
hate
me
with
all
your
heart
and
that
you
are
a
liar
whether
you
know
it
or
not
you
took
me
down
to
see
your
bride
a
bit
in
the
world
to
try
how
she
would
behave
in
the
society
of
other
idea
simply
saw
me
yesterday
and
your
vile
impulse
led
you
to
carry
me
off
there
in
order
that
you
might
show
me
the
girl
and
say
as
it
were
there
look
at
that
she
s
to
be
mine
try
your
hand
if
you
can
it
was
nothing
but
your
challenge
to
me
you
may
not
have
known
it
but
this
was
so
as
i
say
and
you
felt
the
impulse
which
i
have
described
such
a
challenge
could
not
be
made
without
hatred
consequently
you
hate
velchaninoff
almost
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
shouted
the
above
words
and
with
every
syllable
the
humiliating
consciousness
that
he
was
allowing
himself
to
descend
to
the
level
of
pavel
pavlovitch
afflicted
him
and
tormented
him
more
and
more
i
was
only
anxious
to
be
at
peace
with
you
alexey
ivanovitch
said
pavel
sadly
his
chin
and
lips
working
again
velchaninoff
flew
into
a
violent
rage
as
if
he
had
been
insulted
in
the
most
unexampled
manner
i
tell
you
once
more
sir
he
cried
that
you
have
attached
yourself
to
a
sick
and
irritated
man
in
order
that
you
may
surprise
him
into
saying
something
unseemly
in
his
madness
we
are
i
tell
you
man
we
are
men
of
different
worlds
understand
me
between
us
two
there
is
a
grave
he
hissed
in
his
fury
and
stopped
and
how
do
you
know
cried
pavel
pavlovitch
his
face
suddenly
becoming
all
twisted
and
deadly
white
to
look
at
as
he
strode
up
to
velchaninoff
how
do
you
know
what
that
grave
means
to
me
sir
here
he
beat
his
breast
with
terrible
earnestness
droll
though
he
looked
yes
sir
we
both
stand
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
but
on
my
side
there
is
more
sir
than
on
more
more
more
he
hissed
beating
his
breast
without
more
than
on
grave
means
more
to
me
than
to
you
but
at
this
moment
a
loud
ring
at
the
bell
brought
both
men
to
their
senses
someone
was
ringing
so
loud
that
the
was
in
danger
of
snapping
people
don
t
ring
like
that
for
me
observed
velchaninoff
no
more
they
do
for
me
sir
i
assure
you
they
don
t
said
pavel
pavlovitch
anxiously
he
had
become
the
quiet
timid
pavel
again
in
a
moment
velchaninoff
frowned
and
went
to
open
the
door
mr
velchaninoff
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
a
strange
voice
apparently
belonging
to
some
young
and
very
person
at
the
door
what
is
it
i
have
been
informed
that
trusotsky
is
at
this
moment
in
your
rooms
i
must
see
him
at
velchaninoff
felt
inclined
to
send
this
looking
young
gentleman
flying
downstairs
again
but
he
stood
aside
and
let
him
in
here
is
trusotsky
come
chapter
xiv
a
young
fellow
of
some
nineteen
summers
entered
the
room
he
might
have
been
even
younger
to
judge
by
his
handsome
but
and
very
juvenile
face
he
was
not
badly
dressed
at
all
events
his
clothes
fitted
him
well
in
stature
he
was
a
little
above
the
middle
height
he
had
thick
black
hair
and
dark
bold
these
were
the
striking
features
of
his
face
unfortunately
his
nose
was
a
little
too
broad
and
otherwise
he
would
have
been
a
really
remarkably
young
came
in
with
some
pretension
i
believe
i
have
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
trusotsky
he
observed
deliberately
and
bringing
out
the
word
opportunity
with
much
apparent
satisfaction
as
though
he
wished
to
accentuate
the
fact
that
he
could
not
possibly
be
supposed
to
feel
either
honour
or
pleasure
in
meeting
trusotsky
velchaninoff
thought
he
knew
what
all
this
meant
pavel
pavlovitch
seemed
to
have
an
inkling
of
the
state
of
affairs
too
his
expression
was
one
of
anxiety
but
he
did
not
show
the
white
feather
not
having
the
honour
of
your
acquaintance
he
said
with
dignity
i
do
not
understand
what
sort
of
business
you
can
have
with
kindly
listen
to
me
first
and
you
can
then
let
me
know
your
ideas
on
the
subject
observed
the
young
gentleman
pulling
out
his
tortoiseshell
glasses
and
focusing
the
champagne
bottle
with
them
having
deliberately
inspected
that
object
he
put
up
his
glasses
again
and
fixing
his
attention
once
more
upon
pavel
pavlovitch
remarked
alexander
what
about
alexander
loboff
that
s
my
name
you
ve
not
heard
of
me
h
m
well
i
don
t
know
when
you
should
have
now
i
think
of
it
but
i
ve
come
on
important
business
concerning
yourself
i
suppose
i
can
sit
down
i
m
oh
pray
sit
down
said
velchaninoff
but
not
before
the
young
man
had
taken
a
chair
in
spite
of
the
pain
at
his
heart
velchaninoff
could
not
help
being
interested
in
this
impudent
youngling
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
his
fresh
young
face
that
reminded
him
of
nadia
you
can
sit
down
too
observed
loboff
indicating
an
empty
seat
to
pavel
pavlovitch
with
a
careless
nod
of
his
head
thank
you
i
shall
very
well
but
you
ll
soon
get
tired
you
need
not
go
away
i
think
i
have
nowhere
to
go
to
my
good
sir
i
am
at
as
you
like
i
confess
i
should
prefer
your
being
present
while
i
have
an
explanation
with
this
gentleman
nadejda
fedosievna
has
given
you
a
flattering
enough
character
sir
to
nonsense
how
could
she
have
had
time
to
do
so
immediately
after
you
left
now
trusotsky
this
is
what
i
wish
to
observe
he
continued
to
pavel
the
latter
still
standing
in
front
of
him
we
that
is
nadejda
fedosievna
and
myself
have
long
loved
one
another
and
have
plighted
our
troth
you
have
suddenly
come
between
us
as
an
obstruction
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
had
better
clear
out
of
the
way
at
once
are
you
prepared
to
adopt
my
suggestion
pavel
pavlovitch
took
a
step
backward
in
amazement
his
face
paled
visibly
but
in
a
moment
a
spiteful
smile
curled
his
lip
not
in
the
slightest
degree
prepared
sir
he
said
laconically
dear
me
said
the
young
fellow
settling
himself
comfortably
in
his
chair
and
throwing
one
leg
over
the
other
indeed
i
do
not
know
whom
i
am
speaking
to
added
pavel
pavlovitch
so
that
it
can
t
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
so
saying
he
sat
down
at
last
i
you
d
get
tired
remarked
the
youth
i
informed
you
just
now
he
added
that
my
name
is
alexander
loboff
and
that
nadejda
and
i
have
plighted
our
troth
consequently
you
can
not
truthfully
say
as
you
did
say
just
now
that
you
don
t
know
who
i
am
nor
can
you
honestly
assert
that
you
do
not
see
what
we
can
have
to
talk
about
not
to
speak
of
is
nadejda
fedosievna
to
be
lady
to
whom
you
have
so
impudently
attached
yourself
that
alone
is
matter
sufficient
for
explanation
between
all
this
the
young
fellow
rattled
off
carelessly
enough
as
if
the
thing
were
so
that
it
hardly
needed
mentioning
while
talking
he
raised
his
once
more
and
inspected
some
object
for
an
instant
putting
the
glass
back
in
his
pocket
immediately
afterwards
excuse
me
young
man
began
pavel
pavlovitch
but
the
words
young
man
were
fatal
at
any
other
moment
observed
the
youth
i
should
of
course
forbid
your
calling
me
young
man
at
once
but
you
must
admit
that
in
this
case
my
youth
is
my
principal
advantage
over
yourself
and
that
even
this
very
day
you
would
have
given
at
the
moment
when
you
presented
your
be
just
a
little
bit
cheeky
young
brat
muttered
velchaninoff
in
any
case
began
pavel
pavlovitch
with
dignity
i
do
not
consider
your
reasons
as
set
questionable
and
improper
reasons
at
the
to
justify
the
continuance
of
this
conversation
i
see
your
business
is
mere
childishness
and
nonsense
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
an
explanation
with
zachlebnikoff
my
respected
friend
meanwhile
sir
perhaps
you
will
make
it
convenient
that
s
the
sort
of
man
he
is
cried
the
youth
hotly
turning
to
velchaninoff
he
is
not
content
with
being
as
good
as
kicked
out
of
the
place
and
having
faces
made
at
him
but
he
must
go
down
again
to
carry
tales
about
us
to
zachlebnikoff
do
you
not
prove
by
this
you
obstinate
man
that
you
wish
to
carry
off
the
young
lady
by
force
that
you
desire
to
her
of
people
who
to
the
relics
of
barbarism
still
triumphant
among
species
of
power
over
her
surely
she
showed
you
sufficiently
clearly
that
she
you
you
have
had
your
wretched
tasteless
present
of
bracelet
to
you
what
more
do
you
want
excuse
me
no
bracelet
has
been
or
can
be
returned
to
me
said
pavel
pavlovitch
with
a
shudder
of
anxiety
however
how
so
hasn
t
velchaninoff
given
it
to
you
oh
the
deuce
take
you
sir
thought
velchaninoff
nadejda
fedosievna
certainly
did
give
me
this
case
for
you
pavel
pavlovitch
he
said
i
did
not
wish
to
take
it
but
she
was
anxious
that
i
should
here
it
is
i
m
very
he
took
out
the
case
and
laid
it
down
on
the
table
before
the
enraged
pavel
pavlovitch
how
is
it
you
have
not
handed
it
to
him
before
asked
the
young
man
severely
i
had
no
time
as
you
may
conclude
said
velchaninoff
with
a
frown
h
m
strange
circumstance
sir
well
you
must
admit
it
strange
however
i
am
quite
prepared
to
believe
that
there
has
been
some
velchaninoff
would
have
given
worlds
to
get
up
and
drub
the
impertinent
young
rascal
and
drag
him
out
of
the
house
by
the
ear
but
he
could
not
contain
himself
and
burst
out
laughing
the
boy
immediately
followed
suit
and
laughed
too
but
for
pavel
pavlovitch
it
was
no
laughing
matter
if
velchaninoff
had
seen
the
ferocious
look
which
the
former
cast
at
him
at
the
moment
when
he
and
loboff
laughed
he
would
have
realized
that
pavel
pavlovitch
was
in
the
act
of
passing
a
fatal
limit
of
forbearance
he
did
not
see
the
look
but
it
struck
him
that
it
was
only
fair
to
stand
up
for
pavel
now
listen
loboff
he
said
in
friendly
tones
not
to
enter
into
the
consideration
of
other
matters
i
may
point
out
that
trusotsky
brings
with
him
in
his
wooing
of
miss
zachlebnikoff
a
name
and
circumstances
fully
to
that
esteemed
family
in
the
second
place
he
brings
a
fairly
respectable
position
in
the
world
and
thirdly
he
brings
wealth
therefore
he
may
well
be
surprised
to
find
himself
confronted
by
such
a
rival
as
gentleman
of
great
wealth
doubtless
but
at
the
same
time
so
very
young
that
he
could
not
possibly
look
upon
you
as
a
serious
rival
therefore
again
he
is
quite
right
in
begging
you
to
bring
the
conversation
to
an
what
do
you
mean
by
so
very
young
i
was
nineteen
a
month
since
by
the
law
i
might
have
been
married
long
ago
that
s
a
sufficient
answer
to
your
but
what
father
would
consent
to
allowing
his
daughter
to
marry
you
though
you
may
be
a
rothschild
to
come
or
a
benefactor
to
humanity
in
the
future
a
man
of
nineteen
years
old
is
not
capable
of
answering
for
himself
and
yet
you
are
ready
to
take
on
your
own
responsibility
another
other
words
a
being
who
is
as
much
a
child
as
you
are
yourself
why
it
is
hardly
even
honourable
on
your
part
is
it
i
have
presumed
to
address
you
thus
because
you
yourself
referred
the
matter
to
me
as
a
sort
of
arbiter
between
yourself
and
pavel
yes
pavel
pavlovitch
i
forgot
he
was
called
that
remarked
the
youth
i
wonder
why
i
thought
of
him
all
along
as
vassili
look
here
sir
addressing
velchaninoff
you
have
not
surprised
me
in
the
least
i
knew
you
were
all
tarred
with
one
brush
it
is
strange
that
you
should
have
been
described
to
me
as
a
man
of
some
originality
however
to
business
all
that
you
have
said
is
of
course
utter
nonsense
not
only
is
there
nothing
dishonourable
about
my
intentions
as
you
permitted
yourself
to
suggest
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
entirely
the
reverse
as
i
hope
to
prove
to
you
in
the
first
place
we
have
promised
each
other
marriage
besides
which
i
have
given
her
my
word
that
if
she
ever
repents
of
her
promise
she
shall
have
her
full
liberty
to
throw
me
over
i
have
given
her
surety
to
that
effect
before
i
bet
anything
your
s
his
name
invented
that
idea
cried
velchaninoff
giggled
pavel
pavlovitch
contemptuously
what
is
that
person
giggling
about
you
are
right
sir
it
was
predposiloff
s
idea
but
i
don
t
think
you
and
i
quite
understand
one
another
do
we
and
i
had
such
a
good
report
of
you
how
old
are
you
are
you
fifty
yet
stick
to
business
if
you
forgive
the
liberty
i
did
not
mean
anything
offensive
well
to
proceed
i
am
no
millionaire
and
i
am
no
great
benefactor
to
humanity
to
reply
to
your
arguments
but
i
shall
manage
to
keep
myself
and
my
wife
of
course
i
have
nothing
now
i
was
brought
up
in
fact
in
their
house
from
my
how
so
oh
because
i
am
a
distant
relative
of
this
zachlebnikoff
s
wife
when
my
people
died
he
took
me
in
and
sent
me
to
school
the
old
fellow
is
really
quite
a
man
if
you
only
knew
i
do
know
it
yes
he
s
an
old
fogey
rather
but
a
old
fellow
but
i
left
him
four
months
ago
and
began
to
keep
myself
i
first
joined
a
railway
office
at
ten
roubles
a
month
and
am
now
in
a
notary
s
place
at
i
made
him
a
formal
proposal
for
her
a
fortnight
since
he
first
laughed
like
mad
and
afterwards
fell
into
a
violent
rage
and
nadia
was
locked
up
she
bore
it
heroically
he
had
been
furious
with
me
before
for
throwing
up
a
post
in
his
department
which
he
procured
for
me
you
see
he
is
a
good
and
kind
old
fellow
at
home
but
get
him
in
his
office
my
word
s
a
sort
of
i
told
him
straight
out
that
i
didn
t
like
his
ways
but
the
great
row
to
the
second
chief
at
the
office
he
said
i
insulted
him
but
i
only
told
him
he
was
an
ignorant
beggar
so
i
threw
them
all
up
and
went
in
for
the
notary
business
listen
to
that
what
a
clap
we
shall
have
a
directly
what
a
good
thing
i
arrived
before
the
rain
i
came
here
on
foot
you
know
all
the
way
nearly
at
a
run
too
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
miss
nadia
then
especially
since
you
are
not
allowed
to
oh
one
can
always
get
over
the
railing
then
there
s
that
girl
she
helps
and
maria
but
she
s
a
snake
that
girl
what
s
the
matter
are
you
afraid
of
the
no
i
m
ill
velchaninoff
had
risen
from
his
seat
with
a
fearful
sudden
pain
in
his
chest
and
was
trying
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
oh
really
then
i
m
disturbing
you
i
shall
go
at
once
said
the
youth
jumping
up
no
you
don
t
disturb
me
said
velchaninoff
ceremoniously
how
not
of
course
i
do
if
you
ve
got
the
stomach
ache
well
now
s
your
pavlovitch
let
s
conclude
this
matter
i
will
formulate
my
question
for
once
into
words
which
will
adapt
themselves
to
your
understanding
are
you
prepared
to
renounce
your
claim
to
the
hand
of
nadejda
fedosievna
before
her
parents
and
in
my
presence
with
all
due
formality
no
sir
not
in
the
slightest
degree
prepared
said
pavel
pavlovitch
witheringly
and
allow
me
to
say
once
more
that
all
this
is
childish
and
absurd
and
that
you
had
better
clear
out
take
care
said
the
youth
holding
up
a
warning
forefinger
better
give
it
up
now
for
i
warn
you
that
otherwise
you
will
spend
a
lot
of
money
down
there
and
take
a
lot
of
trouble
and
when
you
come
back
in
nine
months
you
will
be
turned
out
of
the
house
by
nadejda
fedosievna
herself
and
if
you
don
t
go
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
excuse
me
for
saying
so
but
at
present
you
are
like
the
dog
in
the
manger
think
over
it
and
be
sensible
for
once
in
your
spare
me
the
moral
if
you
please
began
pavel
pavlovitch
furiously
and
as
for
your
low
threats
i
shall
take
my
measures
low
threats
pooh
you
are
low
yourself
to
take
them
as
such
very
well
i
ll
wait
till
then
but
if
s
the
thunder
again
glad
to
have
met
you
he
nodded
to
velchaninoff
and
made
off
hurriedly
evidently
anxious
to
reach
home
before
the
rain
chapter
xv
you
see
you
see
cried
pavel
to
velchaninoff
the
instant
that
the
young
fellow
s
back
was
turned
yes
you
are
not
going
to
succeed
there
said
velchaninoff
he
would
not
have
been
so
abrupt
and
careless
of
pavel
s
feelings
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dreadful
pain
in
his
chest
pavel
pavlovitch
shuddered
as
though
from
a
sudden
scald
well
sir
and
were
loth
to
give
me
back
the
bracelet
eh
i
hadn
t
oh
you
were
pitied
me
as
true
friend
pities
friend
oh
well
i
pitied
you
then
velchaninoff
was
growing
angrier
every
moment
however
he
informed
pavel
pavlovitch
shortly
as
to
how
he
had
received
the
bracelet
and
how
nadia
had
almost
forced
it
upon
him
you
must
understand
he
added
that
otherwise
i
should
never
have
agreed
to
accept
the
commission
there
are
quite
enough
disagreeables
you
liked
the
job
and
accepted
it
with
pleasure
giggled
pavel
pavlovitch
that
is
foolish
on
your
part
but
i
suppose
you
must
be
forgiven
you
must
have
seen
from
that
boy
s
behaviour
that
i
play
no
part
in
this
matter
others
are
the
principal
actors
not
i
at
all
events
the
job
had
attractions
for
pavel
pavlovitch
sat
down
and
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
you
think
i
shall
knuckle
under
to
that
young
gentleman
pooh
i
shall
drive
him
out
sir
like
dust
i
ll
smoke
this
little
gentleman
out
of
his
nursery
sir
you
see
if
i
don
he
drank
his
wine
off
at
a
gulp
and
poured
out
some
more
he
seemed
to
grow
freer
as
the
moments
went
by
he
talked
glibly
now
sachinka
and
nadienka
darling
little
children
he
was
beside
himself
with
fury
at
this
moment
a
terrific
crash
of
thunder
startled
the
silence
and
was
followed
by
flashes
of
lightning
and
sheets
of
heavy
rain
pavel
pavlovitch
rose
and
shut
the
window
the
fellow
asked
you
if
you
were
afraid
of
the
thunder
do
you
remember
velchaninoff
afraid
of
thunder
and
all
that
about
fifty
years
old
wasn
t
bad
eh
pavel
pavlovitch
was
in
a
spiteful
mood
you
seem
to
have
settled
yourself
here
said
velchaninoff
who
could
hardly
speak
for
agony
do
as
you
like
i
must
lie
come
you
wouldn
t
turn
a
out
replied
pavel
glad
of
a
grievance
of
course
sit
down
drink
your
anything
you
like
murmured
velchaninoff
as
he
laid
himself
flat
on
his
divan
and
groaned
with
pain
am
i
to
spend
the
night
aren
t
you
afraid
what
of
asked
velchaninoff
raising
his
head
slightly
oh
nothing
only
last
time
you
seemed
to
be
a
little
alarmed
that
s
you
are
a
fool
said
the
other
angrily
as
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
very
well
sir
all
right
said
pavel
velchaninoff
fell
asleep
within
a
minute
or
so
of
lying
down
the
unnatural
strain
of
the
day
and
his
sickly
state
of
health
together
had
suddenly
undermined
his
strength
and
he
was
as
weak
as
a
child
but
physical
pain
would
have
its
own
and
soon
conquered
weakness
and
sleep
in
an
hour
he
was
wide
awake
again
and
rose
from
the
divan
in
anguish
pavel
pavlovitch
was
asleep
on
the
other
sofa
he
was
dressed
and
in
his
boots
his
hat
lay
on
the
floor
and
his
hung
by
its
cord
almost
to
the
ground
velchaninoff
did
not
wake
his
guest
the
room
was
full
of
tobacco
smoke
and
the
bottle
was
empty
he
looked
savagely
at
the
sleeping
drunkard
having
twisted
himself
painfully
off
his
bed
velchaninoff
began
to
walk
about
groaning
and
thinking
of
his
agony
he
could
lie
no
longer
he
was
alarmed
for
this
pain
in
his
chest
and
not
without
reason
he
was
subject
to
these
attacks
and
had
been
so
for
many
years
but
they
came
seldom
a
year
or
two
years
on
such
occasions
his
agony
was
so
dreadful
for
some
ten
hours
or
so
that
he
invariably
believed
that
he
must
be
actually
dying
this
night
his
anguish
was
terrible
it
was
too
late
to
send
for
the
doctor
but
it
was
far
from
morning
yet
he
staggered
up
and
down
the
room
and
before
long
his
groans
became
loud
and
frequent
the
noise
awoke
pavel
pavlovitch
he
sat
up
on
his
divan
and
for
some
time
gazed
in
terror
and
perplexity
upon
velchaninoff
as
the
latter
walked
moaning
up
and
down
at
last
he
gathered
his
senses
and
enquired
anxiously
what
was
the
matter
velchaninoff
muttered
something
unintelligible
it
s
your
m
sure
it
is
cried
pavel
very
wide
awake
of
a
sudden
i
remember
peter
kuzmich
used
to
have
the
same
sort
of
attacks
the
one
can
die
of
it
let
me
go
and
fetch
no
no
i
don
t
want
anything
muttered
velchaninoff
waving
him
off
irritably
but
pavel
knows
beside
himself
with
anxiety
he
was
as
much
exercised
as
though
the
matter
at
issue
were
the
saving
of
his
own
son
s
life
he
insisted
on
immediate
compresses
and
told
velchaninoff
he
must
drink
two
or
three
cups
of
very
hot
weak
hot
he
ran
for
mavra
lighted
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
put
the
kettle
on
put
the
sick
man
back
to
bed
covered
him
up
and
within
twenty
minutes
had
the
first
hot
application
all
ready
as
well
as
the
tea
hot
plates
sir
hot
plates
he
cried
as
he
clapped
the
first
wrapped
in
a
napkin
on
to
velchaninoff
s
chest
i
have
nothing
else
handy
but
i
give
you
my
word
it
s
as
good
as
anything
else
drink
this
tea
quick
never
mind
if
you
scald
your
is
dearer
you
can
die
of
this
sort
of
thing
you
he
sent
sleepy
mavra
out
of
her
wits
with
flurry
the
plates
were
changed
every
couple
of
minutes
at
the
third
application
and
after
having
taken
two
cups
of
scalding
tea
velchaninoff
suddenly
felt
decidedly
better
capital
thank
god
if
we
can
once
get
the
better
of
the
pain
it
s
a
good
sign
cried
pavel
delightedly
and
away
he
ran
for
another
plate
and
some
more
tea
if
only
we
can
beat
the
pain
down
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
every
minute
in
half
an
hour
the
agony
was
passed
but
the
sick
man
was
so
completely
knocked
up
that
in
spite
of
pavel
s
repeated
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
apply
just
one
more
plate
he
could
bear
no
more
his
eyes
were
drooping
from
weakness
he
muttered
faintly
very
well
consented
pavel
go
to
are
you
spending
the
night
here
what
time
is
it
nearly
you
must
sleep
yes
right
i
a
moment
after
the
sick
man
called
to
pavel
again
muttered
the
former
faintly
as
pavel
ran
up
and
bent
over
him
you
are
better
than
i
am
i
understand
you
go
to
sleep
whispered
pavel
pavlovitch
as
he
crept
back
to
his
divan
on
velchaninoff
dozing
off
heard
pavel
quietly
make
his
bed
undress
and
lie
down
all
very
softly
and
then
put
the
light
out
undoubtedly
velchaninoff
fell
asleep
very
quietly
when
the
light
was
once
out
he
remembered
that
much
afterwards
yet
all
the
while
he
was
asleep
and
until
he
awoke
he
dreamed
that
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
in
spite
of
his
weakness
at
length
he
dreamed
that
he
was
delirious
and
that
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
chase
away
the
visions
which
crowded
in
upon
him
although
he
was
conscious
the
whole
while
they
but
visions
and
not
reality
the
apparition
was
familiar
to
him
he
thought
that
his
front
door
was
open
and
that
his
room
gradually
filled
with
people
pouring
in
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
one
man
exactly
as
had
been
the
case
a
month
before
during
one
of
his
dreams
as
on
the
previous
occasion
this
man
leant
on
his
elbow
at
the
table
and
would
not
speak
he
was
in
a
round
hat
with
a
crape
band
how
thought
the
dreamer
was
it
really
pavel
pavlovitch
last
time
as
well
however
when
he
looked
at
the
man
s
face
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
quite
another
person
why
has
he
a
crape
band
then
thought
velchaninoff
in
perplexity
the
noise
and
chattering
of
all
these
people
was
dreadful
they
seemed
even
more
exasperated
with
velchaninoff
than
on
the
former
occasion
they
were
all
threatening
him
with
something
or
other
shaking
their
fists
at
him
and
shouting
something
which
he
could
not
understand
it
s
all
a
vision
he
dreamed
i
know
quite
well
that
i
am
up
and
about
because
i
could
not
lie
still
for
anguish
yet
the
cries
and
noise
at
times
seemed
so
real
that
he
was
now
and
again
of
their
reality
surely
this
be
delirium
he
thought
what
on
earth
do
all
these
people
want
of
god
yet
if
it
were
not
a
vision
surely
all
these
cries
would
have
roused
pavel
pavlovitch
there
he
was
fast
asleep
in
his
divan
then
something
suddenly
occurred
as
in
the
old
dream
another
crowd
of
people
surged
in
crushing
those
who
were
already
collected
inside
these
new
arrivals
carried
something
large
and
heavy
he
could
judge
of
the
weight
by
their
footsteps
labouring
upstairs
those
in
the
room
cried
they
re
bringing
it
they
re
bringing
it
every
eye
flashed
as
it
turned
and
glared
at
velchaninoff
every
hand
threatened
him
and
then
pointed
to
the
stairs
undoubtedly
it
was
reality
not
delirium
velchaninoff
thought
that
he
stood
up
and
raised
himself
on
in
order
to
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
he
wanted
to
know
what
was
being
carried
in
his
heart
beat
wildly
wildly
wildly
and
suddenly
as
in
his
former
dream
there
came
loud
rings
at
the
bell
and
again
the
sound
of
the
bell
was
so
distinct
and
clear
that
he
felt
it
not
be
a
dream
he
gave
a
cry
and
awoke
but
he
did
not
rush
to
the
door
as
on
the
former
occasion
what
sudden
idea
was
it
that
guided
his
movements
had
he
any
idea
at
all
or
was
it
impulse
that
prompted
him
what
to
do
he
sprang
up
in
bed
with
arms
outstretched
as
though
to
ward
off
an
attack
straight
towards
the
divan
where
pavel
pavlovitch
was
sleeping
his
hands
encountered
other
hands
outstretched
in
his
direction
consequently
some
one
must
have
been
standing
over
him
the
curtains
were
drawn
but
it
was
not
absolutely
dark
because
a
faint
light
came
from
the
next
room
which
had
no
curtains
suddenly
something
cut
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
some
of
his
fingers
causing
him
sharp
pain
he
instantly
realized
that
he
had
seized
a
knife
or
a
razor
and
he
closed
his
hand
upon
it
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
at
that
moment
something
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
hard
metallic
sound
velchaninoff
was
probably
three
times
as
strong
as
pavel
pavlovitch
but
the
struggle
lasted
for
a
long
least
three
minutes
the
former
however
forced
his
adversary
to
the
earth
and
bent
his
arms
back
behind
his
head
then
he
paused
for
he
was
most
anxious
to
tie
the
hands
holding
the
assassin
s
wrist
with
his
wounded
left
hand
he
felt
for
the
blind
cord
with
his
right
for
a
long
while
he
could
not
find
it
at
last
he
grasped
it
and
tore
it
down
he
was
amazed
afterwards
at
the
unnatural
strength
which
he
must
have
displayed
during
all
this
during
the
whole
of
the
struggle
neither
man
spoke
a
word
only
their
heavy
breathing
was
audible
and
the
inarticulate
sounds
emitted
by
both
as
they
fought
at
length
having
secured
his
opponent
s
hands
velchaninoff
left
him
on
the
ground
rose
drew
the
curtains
and
pulled
up
the
blind
the
deserted
street
was
light
now
he
opened
the
window
and
stood
breathing
in
the
fresh
air
for
a
few
moments
it
was
a
little
past
four
o
clock
he
shut
the
window
once
more
fetched
a
towel
and
bound
up
his
cut
hand
as
tightly
as
he
could
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
at
his
feet
he
caught
sight
of
the
opened
razor
lying
on
the
carpet
he
picked
it
up
wiped
it
and
put
it
by
in
its
own
case
which
he
now
saw
he
had
left
upon
the
little
cupboard
beside
the
divan
which
pavel
pavlovitch
occupied
he
locked
the
cupboard
having
completed
all
these
arrangements
he
approached
pavel
pavlovitch
and
looked
at
him
meanwhile
the
latter
had
managed
to
raise
himself
from
the
floor
and
reach
a
chair
he
was
now
sitting
in
to
his
shirt
which
was
stained
with
marks
of
blood
both
back
and
s
blood
not
his
own
of
course
this
was
pavel
pavlovitch
but
it
would
have
been
only
natural
for
any
one
who
had
known
him
before
and
saw
him
at
this
moment
to
doubt
his
identity
he
sat
upright
in
his
stiffly
owing
to
the
uncomfortable
position
of
his
tightly
bound
hands
behind
his
back
his
face
looked
yellow
and
crooked
and
he
shuddered
every
other
moment
he
gazed
intently
but
with
an
expression
of
dazed
perplexity
at
velchaninoff
suddenly
he
smiled
gravely
and
nodding
towards
a
carafe
of
water
on
the
table
muttered
a
little
drop
velchaninoff
poured
some
into
a
glass
and
held
it
for
him
to
drink
pavel
gulped
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
suddenly
raised
his
head
and
gazed
intently
at
velchaninoff
standing
over
him
he
said
nothing
however
but
finished
the
water
he
then
sighed
deeply
velchaninoff
took
his
pillows
and
some
of
his
clothing
and
went
into
the
next
room
locking
pavel
pavlovitch
behind
him
his
pain
had
quite
disappeared
but
he
felt
very
weak
after
the
strain
of
his
late
exertion
goodness
knows
whence
came
his
strength
for
the
trial
he
tried
to
think
but
he
could
not
collect
his
ideas
the
shock
had
been
too
great
his
eyes
would
droop
now
and
again
sometimes
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
then
he
would
shudder
wake
up
remember
all
that
had
passed
and
raise
the
rag
bound
about
his
hand
to
prove
the
reality
of
his
thoughts
then
he
would
relapse
into
eager
feverish
thought
one
thing
was
quite
certain
pavel
pavlovitch
had
intended
to
cut
his
throat
though
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
fatal
moment
he
had
not
known
that
he
would
make
the
attempt
perhaps
he
had
seen
the
razor
case
last
evening
and
thought
nothing
of
it
only
remembering
the
fact
that
it
was
there
the
razors
were
usually
locked
up
and
only
yesterday
velchaninoff
had
taken
one
out
in
order
to
make
himself
neat
for
his
visit
to
the
country
and
had
omitted
to
lock
it
up
again
if
he
had
premeditated
murdering
me
he
would
certainly
have
provided
himself
with
a
knife
or
a
pistol
long
ago
he
could
not
have
relied
on
my
razors
which
he
never
saw
until
yesterday
concluded
velchaninoff
at
last
the
clock
struck
six
velchaninoff
arose
dressed
himself
and
went
into
pavel
pavlovitch
s
room
as
he
opened
the
door
he
wondered
why
he
had
ever
locked
it
and
why
he
had
not
allowed
pavel
to
go
away
at
once
to
his
surprise
the
prisoner
was
dressed
he
had
doubtless
found
means
to
get
his
hands
loose
he
was
sitting
in
an
but
rose
when
velchaninoff
entered
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
his
anxious
look
seemed
to
say
as
plain
as
words
don
t
talk
to
me
it
s
no
use
t
talk
to
me
go
said
velchaninoff
take
your
he
added
pavel
pavlovitch
turned
back
and
seized
his
stuffing
it
into
his
pocket
and
went
out
velchaninoff
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
to
shut
the
front
door
after
him
their
looks
met
for
the
last
time
pavel
pavlovitch
stopped
and
the
two
men
gazed
into
each
others
eyes
for
five
seconds
or
so
as
though
in
indecision
at
length
velchaninoff
faintly
waved
him
away
with
his
hand
go
he
said
only
half
aloud
as
he
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
chapter
xvi
a
feeling
of
immense
happiness
took
possession
of
velchaninoff
something
was
finished
and
done
with
and
settled
some
huge
anxiety
was
at
an
end
so
it
seemed
to
him
this
anxiety
had
lasted
five
weeks
he
raised
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
rag
bound
about
it
oh
yes
he
thought
it
is
indeed
all
over
and
all
this
first
time
for
many
a
day
he
did
not
even
once
think
of
liza
just
as
if
the
blood
from
those
cut
fingers
had
wiped
out
that
grief
as
well
and
made
him
quits
with
it
he
quite
realized
how
terrible
was
the
danger
which
he
had
passed
through
for
those
people
he
thought
who
do
not
know
a
minute
or
two
that
they
are
going
to
murder
you
when
they
once
get
the
knife
into
their
hands
and
feel
the
first
touch
of
warm
heaven
they
not
only
cut
your
throat
they
hack
your
head
off
off
velchaninoff
could
not
sit
at
home
he
go
out
and
let
something
happen
to
him
and
he
walked
about
in
hopes
of
something
turning
up
he
longed
to
and
it
struck
him
that
he
might
fairly
go
to
the
doctor
and
talk
to
him
and
have
his
hand
properly
bound
up
the
doctor
inquired
how
he
hurt
his
hand
which
made
velchaninoff
laugh
like
mad
he
was
on
the
point
of
telling
all
but
refrained
several
times
during
the
day
he
was
on
the
point
of
telling
others
the
whole
story
once
it
was
to
a
perfect
stranger
in
a
restaurant
with
whom
he
had
begun
to
converse
on
his
own
initiative
before
this
day
he
had
hated
the
very
idea
of
speaking
to
strangers
in
the
public
restaurants
he
went
into
a
shop
and
ordered
some
new
clothes
not
with
the
idea
of
visiting
the
pogoryeltseffs
thought
of
any
such
visit
was
distasteful
to
him
besides
he
could
not
leave
town
he
felt
that
he
must
stay
and
see
what
was
going
to
happen
velchaninoff
dined
and
enjoyed
his
dinner
talking
affably
to
his
neighbour
and
to
the
waiter
as
well
when
evening
fell
he
went
home
his
head
was
whirling
a
little
and
he
felt
slightly
delirious
the
first
sight
of
his
rooms
gave
him
quite
a
start
he
walked
round
them
and
reflected
he
visited
the
kitchen
which
he
had
hardly
ever
done
before
in
his
life
and
thought
this
is
where
they
heated
the
plates
last
he
locked
the
doors
carefully
and
lit
his
candles
earlier
than
usual
as
he
shut
the
door
he
remembered
that
he
had
asked
mavra
as
he
passed
the
dvornik
s
lodging
whether
pavel
pavlovitch
had
been
just
as
if
the
latter
could
possibly
have
been
near
the
place
having
then
carefully
locked
himself
in
he
opened
the
little
cupboard
where
his
razors
were
kept
and
took
out
the
razor
there
was
still
some
of
the
blood
on
the
bone
handle
he
put
the
razor
back
again
and
locked
the
cupboard
he
was
sleepy
he
felt
that
he
must
go
to
sleep
as
speedily
as
possible
otherwise
he
would
be
useless
for
and
seemed
to
him
for
some
reason
or
other
to
be
about
to
be
a
fateful
day
for
him
but
all
those
thoughts
which
had
crowded
in
upon
him
all
day
and
had
never
left
him
for
a
moment
were
still
in
full
swing
within
his
brain
he
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
could
not
fall
asleep
if
pavel
pavlovitch
arrived
at
murdering
point
accidentally
had
he
ever
seriously
thought
of
murder
even
for
a
single
evil
instant
before
velchaninoff
decided
the
question
strangely
enough
pavel
pavlovitch
the
desire
to
murder
him
but
did
not
himself
know
of
the
existence
of
this
desire
it
seems
an
absurd
conclusion
but
so
it
is
thought
velchaninoff
pavel
pavlovitch
did
not
come
to
petersburg
to
look
out
for
a
new
appointment
nor
did
he
come
for
the
sake
of
finding
bagantoff
in
spite
of
his
rage
when
the
latter
died
no
he
despised
bagantoff
thoroughly
pavel
pavlovitch
had
come
to
petersburg
for
and
had
brought
liza
with
him
for
him
alone
velchaninoff
did
expect
to
have
my
throat
cut
velchaninoff
decided
that
he
expected
it
from
the
moment
when
he
saw
pavel
pavlovitch
in
the
carriage
following
in
bagantoff
s
funeral
procession
that
is
i
expected
course
not
exactly
to
have
my
throat
cut
and
it
was
not
all
yesterday
he
reflected
raising
his
head
from
the
pillow
in
the
excitement
of
the
idea
it
can
not
have
been
all
in
good
faith
that
that
fellow
assured
me
of
his
love
for
me
beating
his
breast
and
with
his
under
lip
trembling
as
he
spoke
yes
it
was
absolutely
he
decided
this
quasimodo
of
was
quite
good
enough
and
generous
enough
to
fall
in
love
with
his
wife
s
wife
in
whom
he
never
observed
anything
during
the
twenty
years
of
their
married
life
he
respected
and
loved
me
for
nine
years
and
remembered
both
me
and
my
sayings
my
goodness
to
think
of
that
and
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
all
this
oh
no
he
was
not
lying
yesterday
but
did
he
love
me
he
declared
his
love
for
me
and
said
that
we
must
be
quits
yes
he
did
he
loved
me
spiteful
love
is
sometimes
the
strongest
of
all
i
daresay
i
made
a
colossal
impression
upon
him
down
at
for
it
is
just
upon
such
men
that
one
is
liable
to
make
a
colossal
impression
he
exaggerated
my
value
a
thousand
fold
perhaps
it
was
my
philosophical
retirement
that
struck
him
it
would
be
curious
to
discover
precisely
what
it
was
that
made
so
great
an
impression
upon
him
who
knows
it
may
have
been
that
i
wore
a
good
pair
of
gloves
and
knew
how
to
put
them
on
these
quasimodo
fellows
love
æstheticism
to
distraction
give
them
a
start
in
the
direction
of
admiration
for
yourself
and
they
will
do
all
the
rest
and
give
you
a
thousand
times
more
than
your
due
of
every
virtue
that
exists
will
fight
to
the
death
for
you
with
pleasure
if
you
ask
it
of
them
how
high
he
must
have
held
my
aptitude
for
illusionizing
others
perhaps
that
has
struck
him
as
much
as
anything
else
for
he
remarked
if
man
deceived
me
whom
am
i
ever
to
trust
again
after
such
a
cry
as
that
a
man
may
well
turn
wild
beast
and
he
came
here
to
embrace
and
weep
over
me
as
he
expressed
it
h
m
that
means
he
came
to
cut
my
throat
and
that
he
came
to
embrace
and
weep
over
me
he
brought
liza
with
him
too
what
if
i
wept
with
him
and
embraced
him
perhaps
he
really
would
have
fully
and
entirely
forgiven
he
was
yearning
to
forgive
me
i
could
see
that
and
all
this
turned
to
drunkenness
and
bestiality
at
the
first
check
yes
pavel
pavlovitch
the
most
deformed
of
all
deformities
is
the
abortion
with
noble
feelings
and
this
man
was
foolish
enough
to
take
me
down
to
see
his
my
goodness
his
bride
only
such
a
lunatic
of
a
fellow
could
ever
have
developed
so
wild
an
idea
as
a
new
existence
to
be
inaugurated
by
an
alliance
between
himself
and
nadia
but
you
are
not
to
blame
pavel
pavlovitch
you
are
a
deformity
and
all
your
ideas
and
actions
and
aspirations
must
of
necessity
be
deformed
but
deformity
though
he
be
why
in
the
world
was
sanction
blessing
as
it
were
necessary
to
his
union
with
miss
zachlebnikoff
perhaps
he
sincerely
hoped
that
there
with
so
much
sweet
innocence
and
charm
around
us
we
should
fall
into
each
other
s
arms
in
some
leafy
spot
and
weep
out
our
differences
on
each
other
s
shoulders
was
in
his
thoughts
when
i
caught
him
standing
between
our
beds
that
first
time
in
the
darkness
no
i
think
not
and
yet
the
first
idea
of
it
may
have
entered
his
soul
as
he
stood
if
i
had
not
left
the
razors
out
probably
nothing
would
have
happened
surely
that
is
so
for
he
avoided
me
for
was
for
me
and
avoided
me
he
chose
bagantoff
to
expend
his
wrath
upon
first
not
me
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
fussed
over
the
hot
plates
to
divert
his
mind
from
murder
the
knife
to
charity
perhaps
he
tried
to
save
both
himself
and
me
by
his
hot
plates
so
mused
velchaninoff
his
poor
overwrought
brain
working
on
and
on
and
jumping
from
conclusion
to
conclusion
with
the
endless
activity
of
fever
until
he
fell
asleep
next
morning
he
awoke
with
no
less
tired
brain
and
body
but
with
a
new
terror
an
unexpected
and
novel
feeling
of
dread
hanging
over
him
this
dread
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
felt
that
he
velchaninoff
must
go
and
see
pavel
pavlovitch
that
very
day
he
knew
not
why
he
must
go
but
he
felt
drawn
to
go
as
though
by
some
unseen
force
the
idea
was
too
loathsome
to
look
into
so
he
left
it
to
take
care
of
itself
as
an
unalterable
fact
the
madness
of
it
however
was
modified
and
the
whole
aspect
of
the
thought
became
more
reasonable
after
a
while
when
it
took
shape
and
resolved
itself
into
a
conviction
in
velchaninoff
s
mind
that
pavel
pavlovitch
had
returned
home
locked
himself
up
and
hung
himself
to
the
bedpost
as
maria
sisevna
had
described
of
the
wretched
suicide
witnessed
by
poor
liza
why
should
the
fool
hang
himself
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
yet
the
thought
return
that
he
was
bound
to
hang
himself
as
liza
had
said
that
he
threatened
to
do
velchaninoff
could
not
help
adding
that
if
he
were
in
pavel
pavlovitch
s
place
he
would
probably
do
the
same
so
the
end
of
it
was
that
instead
of
going
out
to
his
dinner
he
set
off
for
pavel
pavlovitch
s
lodging
just
to
ask
maria
sisevna
after
but
before
he
had
reached
the
street
he
paused
and
his
face
flushed
up
with
shame
surely
i
am
not
going
there
to
embrace
and
weep
over
him
surely
i
am
not
going
to
add
this
one
last
pitiful
folly
to
the
long
list
of
my
late
shameful
actions
however
his
good
providence
saved
him
from
this
pitiful
folly
for
he
had
hardly
passed
through
the
large
gateway
into
the
street
when
alexander
loboff
suddenly
collided
with
him
the
young
fellow
was
dashing
along
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
i
was
just
coming
to
you
our
friend
pavel
nice
sort
of
fellow
he
has
he
hung
himself
gasped
velchaninoff
hung
himself
who
why
asked
loboff
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
oh
go
on
i
meant
nothing
tfu
what
a
funny
line
your
thoughts
seem
to
take
he
hasn
t
hung
himself
a
in
the
world
should
he
the
contrary
he
s
gone
away
i
ve
just
seen
him
off
my
goodness
how
that
fellow
can
drink
we
had
three
bottles
of
wine
predposiloff
was
there
how
the
fellow
drinks
good
heavens
he
was
singing
in
the
carriage
when
the
train
went
off
he
thought
of
you
and
kissed
his
hand
to
you
and
sent
his
love
he
s
a
scamp
that
fellow
eh
young
loboff
had
apparently
had
quite
his
share
of
the
three
bottles
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
utterance
thick
velchaninoff
roared
with
laughter
so
you
ended
up
by
weeping
over
each
others
shoulders
did
you
oh
you
poetical
funny
fellows
you
don
t
scold
us
you
must
know
he
went
down
yesterday
and
and
he
has
withdrawn
he
sneaked
like
anything
about
nadia
and
me
they
ve
shut
her
up
there
was
such
a
row
but
we
wouldn
t
give
my
word
how
the
fellow
drinks
he
was
always
talking
about
you
but
of
course
he
is
no
companion
for
you
you
are
more
or
less
a
respectable
sort
of
man
and
must
have
belonged
to
society
at
some
time
of
your
life
though
you
seem
to
have
retired
into
private
life
just
now
is
it
poverty
or
what
i
couldn
t
make
head
or
tail
of
pavel
pavlovitch
s
oh
then
it
was
he
who
gave
you
those
interesting
details
about
me
yes
don
t
be
cross
about
it
it
s
better
to
be
a
citizen
than
a
swell
the
thing
is
one
does
not
know
whom
to
respect
in
russia
nowadays
don
t
you
think
it
a
diseased
feature
of
the
times
in
russia
that
one
doesn
t
know
whom
to
respect
quite
so
quite
so
well
go
on
about
pavel
well
he
sat
down
in
the
railway
carriage
and
began
singing
then
he
cried
a
bit
it
was
really
disgusting
to
see
the
fellow
i
hate
fools
then
he
began
to
throw
money
to
beggars
for
the
repose
of
liza
s
soul
he
said
is
that
his
wife
what
s
the
matter
with
your
hand
i
cut
h
m
never
mind
cheer
up
it
ll
be
all
right
soon
i
am
glad
that
fellow
has
gone
you
know
him
but
i
bet
anything
he
ll
marry
as
soon
as
he
arrives
at
his
well
what
of
that
you
are
going
to
marry
too
i
that
s
quite
a
different
affair
what
a
funny
man
you
are
why
if
are
fifty
he
must
be
sixty
well
glad
i
met
t
come
t
ask
time
he
started
off
at
a
run
but
turned
a
minute
after
and
came
back
what
a
fool
i
am
he
cried
i
forgot
all
about
sent
you
a
letter
here
it
is
how
was
it
you
didn
t
see
him
off
velchaninoff
returned
home
and
opened
the
letter
which
was
sealed
and
addressed
to
himself
there
was
not
a
syllable
inside
in
pavel
pavlovitch
s
own
hand
writing
but
he
drew
out
another
letter
and
knew
the
writing
at
once
it
was
an
old
faded
sheet
of
paper
and
the
ink
was
faint
and
discoloured
the
letter
was
addressed
to
velchaninoff
and
written
ten
years
couple
of
months
after
his
departure
from
he
had
never
received
a
copy
of
this
one
but
another
letter
which
he
well
remembered
had
evidently
been
written
and
sent
instead
of
it
he
could
tell
that
by
the
substance
of
the
faded
document
in
his
hand
in
this
present
letter
natalia
vasilievna
bade
farewell
to
him
for
ever
as
she
had
done
in
the
other
communication
and
informed
him
that
she
expected
her
confinement
in
a
few
months
she
added
for
his
consolation
that
she
would
find
an
opportunity
of
purveying
his
child
to
him
in
good
time
and
pointed
out
that
their
friendship
was
now
cemented
for
ever
she
begged
him
to
love
her
no
longer
because
she
could
no
longer
return
his
love
but
authorized
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
after
a
year
s
absence
in
order
to
see
the
child
goodness
only
knows
why
she
had
not
sent
this
letter
but
had
changed
it
for
another
velchaninoff
was
deadly
pale
when
he
read
this
document
but
he
imagined
pavel
pavlovitch
finding
it
in
the
family
box
of
black
wood
with
ornamentation
and
silver
mounting
and
reading
it
for
the
first
time
i
should
think
he
too
grew
as
pale
as
a
corpse
he
reflected
catching
sight
of
his
own
face
in
the
perhaps
he
read
it
and
then
closed
his
eyes
and
hoped
and
prayed
that
when
he
opened
them
again
the
dreadful
letter
would
be
nothing
but
a
sheet
of
white
paper
once
more
perhaps
the
poor
fellow
tried
this
desperate
expedient
two
or
three
times
before
he
accepted
the
truth
chapter
xvii
the
permanent
husband
two
years
have
elapsed
since
the
events
recorded
in
the
foregoing
chapters
and
we
find
our
friend
velchaninoff
one
lovely
summer
day
seated
in
a
railway
carriage
on
his
way
to
odessa
he
was
making
the
journey
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
a
great
friend
and
of
being
introduced
to
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
he
had
long
wished
to
make
without
entering
into
any
details
we
may
remark
that
velchaninoff
was
entirely
changed
during
these
last
two
years
he
was
no
longer
the
miserable
fanciful
hypochondriac
of
those
dark
days
he
had
returned
to
society
and
to
his
friends
who
gladly
forgave
him
his
temporary
relapse
into
seclusion
even
those
whom
he
had
ceased
to
bow
to
when
met
were
now
among
the
first
to
extend
the
hand
of
friendship
once
more
and
asked
no
as
though
he
had
been
abroad
on
private
business
which
was
no
affair
of
theirs
his
success
in
the
legal
matters
of
which
we
have
heard
and
the
fact
of
having
his
sixty
thousand
roubles
safe
at
his
to
keep
him
all
his
the
elixir
which
brought
him
back
to
health
and
spirits
his
premature
wrinkles
departed
his
eyes
grew
brighter
and
his
complexion
better
he
became
more
active
and
fact
as
he
sat
thinking
in
a
comfortable
carriage
he
looked
a
very
different
man
from
the
velchaninoff
of
two
years
ago
the
next
station
to
be
reached
was
that
at
which
passengers
were
expected
to
dine
forty
minutes
being
allowed
for
this
purpose
it
so
happened
that
velchaninoff
while
seated
at
the
dinner
table
was
able
to
do
a
service
to
a
lady
who
was
also
dining
there
this
lady
was
young
and
nice
looking
though
rather
too
flashily
dressed
and
was
accompanied
by
a
young
officer
who
unfortunately
was
scarcely
in
a
befitting
condition
for
ladies
society
having
refreshed
himself
at
the
bar
to
an
unnecessary
extent
this
young
man
succeeded
in
quarrelling
with
another
person
equally
unfit
for
ladies
society
and
a
brawl
ensued
which
threatened
to
land
both
parties
upon
the
table
in
close
proximity
to
the
lady
velchaninoff
interfered
and
removed
the
brawlers
to
a
safe
distance
to
the
great
and
almost
boundless
gratitude
of
the
alarmed
lady
who
hailed
him
as
her
guardian
velchaninoff
was
interested
in
the
young
woman
who
looked
like
a
respectable
provincial
provincial
manners
and
taste
as
her
dress
and
gestures
showed
a
conversation
was
opened
and
the
lady
immediately
commenced
to
lament
that
her
husband
was
never
by
when
he
was
wanted
and
that
he
had
now
gone
and
hidden
himself
somewhere
just
because
he
happened
to
be
required
poor
fellow
he
ll
catch
it
for
this
thought
velchaninoff
if
you
will
tell
me
your
husband
s
name
he
added
aloud
i
will
find
him
with
pavel
pavlovitch
hiccupped
the
young
officer
your
husband
s
name
is
pavel
pavlovitch
is
it
inquired
velchaninoff
with
curiosity
and
at
the
same
moment
a
familiar
bald
head
was
interposed
between
the
lady
and
himself
here
you
are
cried
the
wife
hysterically
it
was
indeed
pavel
pavlovitch
he
gazed
in
amazement
and
dread
at
velchaninoff
falling
back
before
him
just
as
though
he
saw
a
ghost
so
great
was
his
consternation
that
for
some
time
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
understand
a
single
word
of
what
his
wife
was
telling
was
that
velchaninoff
had
acted
as
her
guardian
angel
and
that
he
pavel
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
never
being
at
hand
when
he
was
wanted
at
last
pavel
pavlovitch
shuddered
and
woke
up
to
consciousness
velchaninoff
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
why
we
are
old
friends
cried
friends
from
childhood
he
clapped
his
hand
familiarly
and
encouragingly
on
pavel
s
shoulder
pavel
smiled
wanly
hasn
t
he
ever
spoken
to
you
of
velchaninoff
no
never
said
the
wife
a
little
confused
then
introduce
me
to
your
wife
you
faithless
friend
is
velchaninoff
muttered
pavel
pavlovitch
looking
the
picture
of
confusion
all
went
swimmingly
after
this
pavel
pavlovitch
was
despatched
to
cater
for
the
party
while
his
lady
informed
velchaninoff
that
they
were
on
their
way
from
where
pavel
pavlovitch
served
to
their
country
lovely
house
she
said
some
miles
away
there
they
hoped
to
receive
a
party
of
friends
and
if
velchaninoff
would
be
so
very
kind
as
to
take
pity
on
their
rustic
home
and
honour
it
with
a
visit
she
should
do
her
best
to
show
her
gratitude
to
the
guardian
angel
who
etc
velchaninoff
replied
that
he
would
be
delighted
and
that
he
was
an
idle
man
and
always
a
compliment
or
two
which
caused
the
fair
lady
to
blush
with
delight
and
to
tell
pavel
pavlovitch
who
now
returned
from
his
quest
that
alexey
ivanovitch
had
been
so
kind
as
to
promise
to
pay
them
a
visit
next
week
and
stay
a
whole
month
pavel
pavlovitch
to
the
amazed
wrath
of
his
wife
smiled
a
sickly
smile
and
said
nothing
after
dinner
the
party
bade
farewell
to
velchaninoff
and
returned
to
their
carriage
while
the
latter
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
smoking
his
cigar
he
knew
that
pavel
pavlovitch
would
return
to
talk
to
him
so
it
turned
out
pavel
came
up
with
an
expression
of
the
most
anxious
and
harassed
misery
velchaninoff
smiled
took
his
arm
led
him
to
a
seat
and
sat
down
beside
him
he
did
not
say
anything
for
he
was
anxious
that
pavel
should
make
the
first
move
so
you
are
coming
to
us
murmured
the
latter
at
last
plunging
medias
i
knew
you
d
begin
like
that
you
haven
t
changed
an
atom
cried
velchaninoff
roaring
with
laughter
and
slapping
him
confidentially
on
the
back
surely
you
don
t
really
suppose
that
i
ever
had
the
smallest
intention
of
visiting
staying
a
month
too
pavel
pavlovitch
gave
a
start
then
you
re
coming
he
cried
without
an
attempt
to
hide
his
joy
no
no
of
course
not
replied
velchaninoff
laughing
he
did
not
know
why
but
all
this
was
exquisitely
droll
to
him
and
the
further
it
went
the
funnier
it
seemed
you
really
serious
cried
pavel
jumping
up
yes
i
tell
you
i
won
t
for
the
world
but
what
will
my
wife
say
now
she
thinks
you
intend
to
come
oh
tell
her
i
ve
broken
my
anything
you
like
she
won
t
believe
said
pavel
looking
anxious
you
catch
it
at
home
i
see
tell
me
who
is
that
young
officer
oh
a
distant
relative
of
unfortunate
young
pavel
pavlovitch
cried
a
voice
from
the
carriage
the
second
bell
has
rung
pavel
was
about
to
move
stopped
him
shall
i
go
and
tell
your
wife
how
you
tried
to
cut
my
throat
he
said
what
are
you
thinking
forbid
cried
pavel
in
a
terrible
fright
well
go
along
then
said
the
other
loosing
his
hold
of
pavel
s
shoulder
won
t
come
will
you
said
pavel
once
more
timidly
and
despairingly
and
clasping
his
hands
in
entreaty
won
swear
ll
be
late
he
put
out
his
hand
mechanically
then
recollected
himself
and
shuddered
pavel
did
not
take
the
proffered
hand
he
withdrew
his
own
the
third
bell
rang
an
instantaneous
but
total
change
seemed
to
have
come
over
both
something
snapped
within
velchaninoff
s
it
seemed
to
him
and
he
who
had
been
roaring
with
laughter
a
moment
before
seized
pavel
pavlovitch
angrily
by
the
shoulder
if
offer
you
my
hand
sir
he
showed
the
scar
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
if
can
offer
you
my
hand
sir
i
should
think
might
accept
it
he
hissed
with
white
and
trembling
lips
pavel
pavlovitch
grew
deadly
white
also
his
lips
quivered
and
a
convulsion
seemed
to
run
through
his
features
he
whispered
quickly
suddenly
his
whole
face
worked
and
tears
started
to
his
eyes
velchaninoff
stood
like
a
log
before
him
pavel
pavlovitch
pavel
pavlovitch
shrieked
the
voice
from
the
carriage
in
despairing
accents
as
though
some
one
were
being
murdered
pavel
roused
himself
and
started
to
run
at
that
moment
the
engine
whistled
and
the
train
moved
off

to
cling
on
