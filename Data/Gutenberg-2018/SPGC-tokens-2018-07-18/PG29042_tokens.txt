lead
them
up
and
down
the
ruddy
glow
of
sunset
was
already
fading
into
the
sombre
shadows
of
night
when
two
travellers
might
have
been
observed
swiftly
at
a
pace
of
six
miles
in
the
hour
descending
the
rugged
side
of
a
mountain
the
younger
bounding
from
crag
to
crag
with
the
agility
of
a
fawn
while
his
companion
whose
aged
limbs
seemed
ill
at
ease
in
the
heavy
chain
armour
habitually
worn
by
tourists
in
that
district
toiled
on
painfully
at
his
side
as
is
always
the
case
under
such
circumstances
the
younger
knight
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
a
goodly
pace
i
trow
he
exclaimed
we
sped
not
thus
in
the
ascent
goodly
indeed
the
other
echoed
with
a
groan
we
clomb
it
but
at
three
miles
in
the
hour
and
on
the
dead
level
our
pace
is
the
younger
suggested
for
he
was
weak
in
statistics
and
left
all
such
details
to
his
aged
companion
four
miles
in
the
hour
the
other
wearily
replied
not
an
ounce
more
he
added
with
that
love
of
metaphor
so
common
in
old
age
and
not
a
farthing
less
was
three
hours
past
high
noon
when
we
left
our
hostelry
the
young
man
said
musingly
we
shall
scarce
be
back
by
perchance
mine
host
will
roundly
deny
us
all
food
he
will
chide
our
tardy
return
was
the
grave
reply
and
such
a
rebuke
will
be
meet
a
brave
conceit
cried
the
other
with
a
merry
laugh
and
should
we
bid
him
bring
us
yet
another
course
i
trow
his
answer
will
be
tart
we
shall
but
get
our
deserts
sighed
the
elder
knight
who
had
never
seen
a
joke
in
his
life
and
was
somewhat
displeased
at
his
untimely
levity
be
nine
of
the
clock
he
added
in
an
undertone
by
the
time
we
regain
our
hostelry
full
many
a
mile
shall
we
have
plodded
this
day
how
many
how
many
cried
the
eager
youth
ever
athirst
for
knowledge
the
old
man
was
silent
tell
me
he
answered
after
a
moment
thought
what
time
it
was
when
we
stood
together
on
yonder
peak
not
exact
to
the
minute
he
added
hastily
reading
a
protest
in
the
young
man
face
an
thy
guess
be
within
one
poor
of
the
mark
is
all
i
ask
of
thy
son
then
will
i
tell
thee
true
to
the
last
inch
how
far
we
shall
have
trudged
betwixt
three
and
nine
of
the
clock
a
groan
was
the
young
man
only
reply
while
his
convulsed
features
and
the
deep
wrinkles
that
chased
each
other
across
his
manly
brow
revealed
the
abyss
of
arithmetical
agony
into
which
one
chance
question
had
plunged
him
knot
ii
eligible
apartments
straight
down
the
crooked
lane
and
all
round
the
square
let
ask
balbus
about
it
said
hugh
all
right
said
lambert
can
guess
it
said
hugh
rather
said
lambert
no
more
words
were
needed
the
two
brothers
understood
each
other
perfectly
illustration
balbus
was
assisting
his
to
convince
the
dragon
balbus
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
hotel
the
journey
down
had
tired
him
he
said
so
his
two
pupils
had
been
the
round
of
the
place
in
search
of
lodgings
without
the
old
tutor
who
had
been
their
inseparable
companion
from
their
childhood
they
had
named
him
after
the
hero
of
their
latin
which
overflowed
with
anecdotes
of
that
versatile
genius
anecdotes
whose
vagueness
in
detail
was
more
than
compensated
by
their
sensational
brilliance
balbus
has
overcome
all
his
enemies
had
been
marked
by
their
tutor
in
the
margin
of
the
book
successful
bravery
in
this
way
he
had
tried
to
extract
a
moral
from
every
anecdote
about
balbus
sometimes
one
of
warning
as
in
balbus
had
borrowed
a
healthy
dragon
against
which
he
had
written
rashness
in
speculation
sometimes
of
encouragement
as
in
the
words
influence
of
sympathy
in
united
action
which
stood
opposite
to
the
anecdote
balbus
was
assisting
his
to
convince
the
dragon
and
sometimes
it
dwindled
down
to
a
single
word
such
as
prudence
which
was
all
he
could
extract
from
the
touching
record
that
balbus
having
scorched
the
tail
of
the
dragon
went
away
his
pupils
liked
the
short
morals
best
as
it
left
them
more
room
for
marginal
illustrations
and
in
this
instance
they
required
all
the
space
they
could
get
to
exhibit
the
rapidity
of
the
hero
departure
their
report
of
the
state
of
things
was
discouraging
that
most
fashionable
of
little
mendip
was
chockfull
as
the
boys
expressed
it
from
end
to
end
but
in
one
square
they
had
seen
no
less
than
four
cards
in
different
houses
all
announcing
in
flaming
capitals
eligible
apartments
so
there
plenty
of
choice
after
all
you
see
said
spokesman
hugh
in
conclusion
that
does
follow
from
the
data
said
balbus
as
he
rose
from
the
easy
chair
where
he
had
been
dozing
over
little
mendip
they
may
be
all
single
rooms
however
we
may
as
well
see
them
i
shall
be
glad
to
stretch
my
legs
a
bit
an
unprejudiced
bystander
might
have
objected
that
the
operation
was
needless
and
that
this
long
lank
creature
would
have
been
all
the
better
with
even
shorter
legs
but
no
such
thought
occurred
to
his
loving
pupils
one
on
each
side
they
did
their
best
to
keep
up
with
his
gigantic
strides
while
hugh
repeated
the
sentence
in
their
letter
just
received
from
abroad
over
which
he
and
lambert
had
been
puzzling
he
says
a
friend
of
his
the
governor
of
was
that
name
again
lambert
kgovjni
said
lambert
well
yes
the
governor
of
wants
to
give
a
small
and
he
means
to
ask
his
father
his
brother
his
brother
and
his
father
and
we
to
guess
how
many
guests
there
will
be
there
was
an
anxious
pause
large
did
he
say
the
pudding
was
to
be
balbus
said
at
last
take
its
cubical
contents
divide
by
the
cubical
contents
of
what
each
man
can
eat
and
the
quotient
he
did
say
anything
about
pudding
said
hugh
and
here
the
square
as
they
turned
a
corner
and
came
into
sight
of
the
eligible
apartments
it
a
square
was
balbus
first
cry
of
delight
as
he
gazed
around
him
beautiful
equilateral
rectangular
the
boys
looked
round
with
less
enthusiasm
number
nine
is
the
first
with
a
card
said
prosaic
lambert
but
balbus
would
not
so
soon
awake
from
his
dream
of
beauty
see
boys
he
cried
twenty
doors
on
a
side
what
symmetry
each
side
divided
into
equal
parts
it
delicious
shall
i
knock
or
ring
said
hugh
looking
in
some
perplexity
at
a
square
brass
plate
which
bore
the
simple
inscription
ring
also
both
said
balbus
that
an
ellipsis
my
boy
did
you
never
see
an
ellipsis
before
i
could
hardly
read
it
said
hugh
evasively
it
no
good
having
an
ellipsis
if
they
do
keep
it
clean
which
there
is
room
gentlemen
said
the
smiling
landlady
and
a
sweet
room
too
as
snug
a
little
we
will
see
it
said
balbus
gloomily
as
they
followed
her
in
i
knew
how
it
would
be
one
room
in
each
house
no
view
i
suppose
which
indeed
there
gentlemen
the
landlady
indignantly
protested
as
she
drew
up
the
blind
and
indicated
the
back
garden
cabbages
i
perceive
said
balbus
well
they
green
at
any
rate
which
the
greens
at
the
shops
their
hostess
explained
are
by
no
means
dependable
upon
here
you
has
them
on
the
premises
of
the
best
does
the
window
open
was
always
balbus
first
question
in
testing
a
lodging
and
does
the
chimney
smoke
his
second
satisfied
on
all
points
he
secured
the
refusal
of
the
room
and
they
moved
on
to
number
this
landlady
was
grave
and
stern
i
nobbut
one
room
left
she
told
them
and
it
gives
on
the
but
there
are
cabbages
balbus
suggested
the
landlady
visibly
relented
there
is
sir
she
said
and
good
ones
though
i
say
it
as
should
we
ca
rely
on
the
shops
for
greens
so
we
grows
them
ourselves
a
singular
advantage
said
balbus
and
after
the
usual
questions
they
went
on
to
and
i
gladly
accommodate
you
all
if
i
could
was
the
greeting
that
met
them
we
are
but
mortal
irrelevant
muttered
balbus
and
let
all
my
rooms
but
one
which
one
is
a
i
perceive
said
balbus
and
looking
out
on
on
cabbages
i
presume
yes
indeed
sir
said
their
hostess
whatever
folks
may
do
grows
our
own
for
the
shops
an
excellent
arrangement
balbus
interrupted
then
one
can
really
depend
on
their
being
good
does
the
window
open
the
usual
questions
were
answered
satisfactorily
but
this
time
hugh
added
one
of
his
own
invention
does
the
cat
scratch
the
landlady
looked
round
suspiciously
as
if
to
make
sure
the
cat
was
not
listening
i
will
not
deceive
you
gentlemen
she
said
it
scratch
but
not
without
you
pulls
its
whiskers
it
never
do
it
she
repeated
slowly
with
a
visible
effort
to
recall
the
exact
words
of
some
written
agreement
between
herself
and
the
cat
without
you
pulls
its
whiskers
much
may
be
excused
in
a
cat
so
treated
said
balbus
as
they
left
the
house
and
crossed
to
number
leaving
the
landlady
curtseying
on
the
doorstep
and
still
murmuring
to
herself
her
parting
words
as
if
they
were
a
form
of
blessing
not
without
you
pulls
its
whiskers
at
number
they
found
only
a
small
shy
girl
to
show
the
house
who
said
yes
in
answer
to
all
questions
the
usual
room
said
balbus
as
they
marched
in
the
usual
the
usual
cabbages
i
suppose
you
ca
get
them
good
at
the
shops
yes
said
the
girl
well
you
may
tell
your
mistress
we
will
take
the
room
and
that
her
plan
of
growing
her
own
cabbages
is
simply
yes
said
the
girl
as
she
showed
them
out
one
and
three
said
balbus
as
they
returned
to
the
hotel
we
will
take
as
our
the
one
that
gives
us
the
least
walking
to
do
to
get
to
it
must
we
walk
from
door
to
door
and
count
the
steps
said
lambert
no
no
figure
it
out
my
boys
figure
it
out
balbus
gaily
exclaimed
as
he
put
pens
ink
and
paper
before
his
hapless
pupils
and
left
the
room
i
say
it
be
a
job
said
hugh
rather
said
lambert
knot
iii
mad
mathesis
i
waited
for
the
train
well
they
call
me
so
because
i
a
little
mad
i
suppose
she
said
in
answer
to
clara
question
as
to
how
she
came
by
so
strange
a
you
see
i
never
do
what
sane
people
are
expected
to
do
i
never
wear
long
trains
talking
of
trains
that
the
charing
cross
metropolitan
station
something
to
tell
you
about
and
i
never
play
i
ca
cook
an
omelette
i
ca
even
set
a
broken
limb
an
ignoramus
for
you
clara
was
her
niece
and
full
twenty
years
her
junior
in
fact
she
was
still
attending
a
high
school
an
institution
of
which
mad
mathesis
spoke
with
undisguised
aversion
let
a
woman
be
meek
and
lowly
she
would
say
none
of
your
high
schools
for
me
but
it
was
just
now
and
clara
was
her
guest
and
mad
mathesis
was
showing
her
the
sights
of
that
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
london
the
charing
cross
metropolitan
station
she
resumed
waving
her
hand
towards
the
entrance
as
if
she
were
introducing
her
niece
to
a
friend
the
bayswater
and
birmingham
extension
is
just
completed
and
the
trains
now
run
round
and
round
continuously
skirting
the
border
of
wales
just
touching
at
york
and
so
round
by
the
east
coast
back
to
london
the
way
the
trains
run
is
peculiar
the
westerly
ones
go
round
in
two
hours
the
easterly
ones
take
three
but
they
always
manage
to
start
two
trains
from
here
opposite
ways
punctually
every
they
part
to
meet
again
said
clara
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
at
the
romantic
thought
no
need
to
cry
about
it
her
aunt
grimly
remarked
they
do
meet
on
the
same
line
of
rails
you
know
talking
of
meeting
an
idea
strikes
me
she
added
changing
the
subject
with
her
usual
abruptness
go
opposite
ways
round
and
see
which
can
meet
most
trains
no
need
for
a
chaperon
ladies
saloon
you
know
you
shall
go
whichever
way
you
like
and
we
have
a
bet
about
it
i
never
make
bets
clara
said
very
gravely
our
excellent
preceptress
has
often
warned
us
you
be
none
the
worse
if
you
did
mad
mathesis
interrupted
in
fact
you
be
the
better
i
certain
neither
does
our
excellent
preceptress
approve
of
puns
said
clara
but
we
have
a
match
if
you
like
let
me
choose
my
train
she
added
after
a
brief
mental
calculation
and
i
engage
to
meet
exactly
half
as
many
again
as
you
do
not
if
you
count
fair
mad
mathesis
bluntly
interrupted
remember
we
only
count
the
trains
we
meet
the
you
must
count
the
one
that
starts
as
you
start
nor
the
one
that
arrives
as
you
arrive
that
will
only
make
the
difference
of
train
said
clara
as
they
turned
and
entered
the
station
but
i
never
travelled
alone
before
there
be
no
one
to
help
me
to
alight
however
i
do
mind
have
a
match
a
ragged
little
boy
overheard
her
remark
and
came
running
after
her
buy
a
box
of
miss
he
pleaded
pulling
her
shawl
to
attract
her
attention
clara
stopped
to
explain
i
never
smoke
cigars
she
said
in
a
meekly
apologetic
tone
our
excellent
preceptress
but
mad
mathesis
impatiently
hurried
her
on
and
the
little
boy
was
left
gazing
after
her
with
round
eyes
of
amazement
the
two
ladies
bought
their
tickets
and
moved
slowly
down
the
central
platform
mad
mathesis
prattling
on
as
usual
clara
silent
anxiously
reconsidering
the
calculation
on
which
she
rested
her
hopes
of
winning
the
match
mind
where
you
go
dear
cried
her
aunt
checking
her
just
in
time
one
step
more
and
you
have
been
in
that
pail
of
cold
water
i
know
i
know
clara
said
dreamily
the
pale
the
cold
and
the
moony
take
your
places
on
the
shouted
a
porter
what
are
for
clara
asked
in
a
terrified
whisper
merely
to
help
us
into
the
trains
the
elder
lady
spoke
with
the
nonchalance
of
one
quite
used
to
the
process
very
few
people
can
get
into
a
carriage
without
help
in
less
than
three
seconds
and
the
trains
only
stop
for
one
second
at
this
moment
the
whistle
was
heard
and
two
trains
rushed
into
the
station
a
moment
pause
and
they
were
gone
again
but
in
that
brief
interval
several
hundred
passengers
had
been
shot
into
them
each
flying
straight
to
his
place
with
the
accuracy
of
a
minie
bullet
while
an
equal
number
were
showered
out
upon
the
three
hours
had
passed
away
and
the
two
friends
met
again
on
the
charing
cross
platform
and
eagerly
compared
notes
then
clara
turned
away
with
a
sigh
to
young
impulsive
hearts
like
hers
disappointment
is
always
a
bitter
pill
mad
mathesis
followed
her
full
of
kindly
sympathy
try
again
my
love
she
said
cheerily
let
us
vary
the
experiment
we
will
start
as
we
did
before
but
not
to
begin
counting
till
our
trains
meet
when
we
see
each
other
we
will
say
and
so
count
on
till
we
come
here
again
clara
brightened
up
i
shall
win
she
exclaimed
eagerly
if
i
may
choose
my
train
another
shriek
of
engine
whistles
another
upheaving
of
another
living
avalanche
plunging
into
two
trains
as
they
flashed
by
and
the
travellers
were
off
again
each
gazed
eagerly
from
her
carriage
window
holding
up
her
handkerchief
as
a
signal
to
her
friend
a
rush
and
a
roar
two
trains
shot
past
each
other
in
a
tunnel
and
two
travellers
leaned
back
in
their
corners
with
a
sigh
or
rather
with
sighs
of
relief
one
clara
murmured
to
herself
won
it
a
word
of
good
omen
time
at
any
rate
the
victory
will
be
mine
but
it
knot
iv
the
dead
reckoning
i
did
dream
of
noonday
on
the
open
sea
within
a
few
degrees
of
the
equator
is
apt
to
be
oppressively
warm
and
our
two
travellers
were
now
airily
clad
in
suits
of
dazzling
white
linen
having
laid
aside
the
which
they
had
found
not
only
endurable
in
the
cold
mountain
air
they
had
lately
been
breathing
but
a
necessary
precaution
against
the
daggers
of
the
banditti
who
infested
the
heights
their
was
over
and
they
were
now
on
their
way
home
in
the
monthly
packet
which
plied
between
the
two
great
ports
of
the
island
they
had
been
exploring
along
with
their
armour
the
tourists
had
laid
aside
the
antiquated
speech
it
had
pleased
them
to
affect
while
in
knightly
disguise
and
had
returned
to
the
ordinary
style
of
two
country
gentlemen
of
the
twentieth
century
stretched
on
a
pile
of
cushions
under
the
shade
of
a
huge
umbrella
they
were
lazily
watching
some
native
fishermen
who
had
come
on
board
at
the
last
each
carrying
over
his
shoulder
a
small
but
heavy
sack
a
large
that
had
been
used
for
cargo
at
the
last
port
stood
on
the
deck
and
round
this
the
fishermen
had
gathered
and
with
much
unintelligible
jabber
seemed
to
be
weighing
their
sacks
more
like
sparrows
in
a
tree
than
human
talk
is
it
the
elder
tourist
remarked
to
his
son
who
smiled
feebly
but
would
not
exert
himself
so
far
as
to
speak
the
old
man
tried
another
listener
what
have
they
got
in
those
sacks
captain
he
inquired
as
that
great
being
passed
them
in
his
never
ending
parade
to
and
fro
on
the
deck
the
captain
paused
in
his
march
and
towered
over
the
travellers
tall
grave
and
serenely
fishermen
he
explained
are
often
passengers
in
my
ship
these
five
are
from
mhruxi
the
place
we
last
touched
at
and
that
the
way
they
carry
their
money
the
money
of
this
island
is
heavy
gentlemen
but
it
costs
little
as
you
may
guess
we
buy
it
from
them
by
weight
about
five
shillings
a
pound
i
fancy
a
ten
would
buy
all
those
sacks
by
this
time
the
old
man
had
closed
his
eyes
in
order
no
doubt
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
on
these
interesting
facts
but
the
captain
failed
to
realise
his
motive
and
with
a
grunt
resumed
his
monotonous
march
meanwhile
the
fishermen
were
getting
so
noisy
over
the
that
one
of
the
sailors
took
the
precaution
of
carrying
off
all
the
weights
leaving
them
to
amuse
themselves
with
such
substitutes
in
the
form
of
as
they
could
find
this
brought
their
excitement
to
a
speedy
end
they
carefully
hid
their
sacks
in
the
folds
of
the
jib
that
lay
on
the
deck
near
the
tourists
and
strolled
away
when
next
the
captain
heavy
footfall
passed
the
younger
man
roused
himself
to
speak
did
you
call
the
place
those
fellows
came
from
captain
he
asked
mhruxi
sir
and
the
one
we
are
bound
for
the
captain
took
a
long
breath
plunged
into
the
word
and
came
out
of
it
nobly
they
call
it
kgovjni
sir
k
i
give
it
up
the
young
man
faintly
said
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
a
glass
of
iced
water
which
the
compassionate
steward
had
brought
him
a
minute
ago
and
had
set
down
unluckily
just
outside
the
shadow
of
the
umbrella
it
was
scalding
hot
and
he
decided
not
to
drink
it
the
effort
of
making
this
resolution
coming
close
on
the
fatiguing
conversation
he
had
just
gone
through
was
too
much
for
him
he
sank
back
among
the
cushions
in
silence
his
father
courteously
tried
to
make
amends
for
his
whereabouts
are
we
now
captain
said
he
have
you
any
idea
the
captain
cast
a
pitying
look
on
the
ignorant
landsman
i
could
tell
you
sir
he
said
in
a
tone
of
lofty
condescension
to
an
inch
you
do
say
so
the
old
man
remarked
in
a
tone
of
languid
surprise
and
mean
so
persisted
the
captain
why
what
do
you
suppose
would
become
of
my
ship
if
i
were
to
lose
my
longitude
and
my
latitude
could
make
anything
of
my
dead
reckoning
nobody
could
i
sure
the
other
heartily
rejoined
but
he
had
overdone
it
it
intelligible
the
captain
said
in
an
offended
tone
to
any
one
that
understands
such
things
with
these
words
he
moved
away
and
began
giving
orders
to
the
men
who
were
preparing
to
hoist
the
jib
our
tourists
watched
the
operation
with
such
interest
that
neither
of
them
remembered
the
five
which
in
another
moment
as
the
wind
filled
out
the
jib
were
whirled
overboard
and
fell
heavily
into
the
sea
but
the
poor
fishermen
had
not
so
easily
forgotten
their
property
in
a
moment
they
had
rushed
to
the
spot
and
stood
uttering
cries
of
fury
and
pointing
now
to
the
sea
and
now
to
the
sailors
who
had
caused
the
disaster
the
old
man
explained
it
to
the
captain
let
us
make
it
up
among
us
he
added
in
conclusion
ten
pounds
will
do
it
i
think
you
said
illustration
but
the
captain
put
aside
the
suggestion
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
no
sir
he
said
in
his
grandest
manner
you
will
excuse
me
i
am
sure
but
these
are
my
passengers
the
accident
has
happened
on
board
my
ship
and
under
my
orders
it
is
for
me
to
make
compensation
he
turned
to
the
angry
fishermen
come
here
my
men
he
said
in
the
mhruxian
dialect
tell
me
the
weight
of
each
sack
i
saw
you
weighing
them
just
now
then
ensued
a
perfect
babel
of
noise
as
the
five
natives
explained
all
screaming
together
how
the
sailors
had
carried
off
the
weights
and
they
had
done
what
they
could
with
whatever
came
handy
two
iron
three
blocks
six
holystones
four
and
a
large
hammer
were
now
carefully
weighed
the
captain
superintending
and
noting
the
results
but
the
matter
did
not
seem
to
be
settled
even
then
an
angry
discussion
followed
in
which
the
sailors
and
the
five
natives
all
joined
and
at
last
the
captain
approached
our
tourists
with
a
disconcerted
look
which
he
tried
to
conceal
under
a
laugh
it
an
absurd
difficulty
he
said
perhaps
one
of
you
gentlemen
can
suggest
something
it
seems
they
weighed
the
sacks
two
at
a
time
if
they
did
have
five
separate
weighings
of
course
you
ca
value
them
separately
the
youth
hastily
decided
let
hear
all
about
it
was
the
old
man
more
cautious
remark
they
have
five
separate
weighings
the
captain
said
but
well
it
beats
entirely
he
added
in
a
sudden
burst
of
candour
the
result
first
and
second
sack
weighed
twelve
pounds
second
and
third
thirteen
and
a
half
third
and
fourth
eleven
and
a
half
fourth
and
fifth
eight
and
then
they
say
they
had
only
the
large
hammer
left
and
it
took
sacks
to
weigh
it
down
that
the
first
third
and
fifth
and
weighed
sixteen
pounds
there
gentlemen
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
the
old
man
muttered
under
his
breath
if
only
my
sister
were
here
and
looked
helplessly
at
his
son
his
son
looked
at
the
five
natives
the
five
natives
looked
at
the
captain
the
captain
looked
at
nobody
his
eyes
were
cast
down
and
he
seemed
to
be
saying
softly
to
himself
contemplate
one
another
gentlemen
if
such
be
your
good
pleasure
contemplate
knot
oughts
and
crosses
look
here
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
and
what
made
you
choose
the
first
train
goosey
said
mad
mathesis
as
they
got
into
the
cab
could
you
count
better
than
i
took
an
extreme
case
was
the
tearful
reply
our
excellent
preceptress
always
says
in
doubt
my
dears
take
an
extreme
case
and
i
in
doubt
does
it
always
succeed
her
aunt
enquired
clara
sighed
not
she
reluctantly
admitted
and
i
make
out
why
one
day
she
was
telling
the
little
girls
they
make
such
a
noise
at
tea
you
know
more
noise
you
make
the
less
jam
you
will
have
and
and
i
thought
they
would
know
what
meant
so
i
explained
it
to
them
i
said
you
make
an
infinite
noise
you
get
no
jam
and
if
you
make
no
noise
you
get
an
infinite
lot
of
jam
but
our
excellent
preceptress
said
that
a
good
instance
was
it
she
added
plaintively
her
aunt
evaded
the
question
one
sees
certain
objections
to
it
she
said
but
how
did
you
work
it
with
the
metropolitan
trains
none
of
them
go
infinitely
fast
i
believe
i
called
them
hares
and
tortoises
clara
said
a
little
timidly
for
she
dreaded
being
laughed
at
and
i
thought
there
could
be
so
many
hares
as
tortoises
on
the
line
so
i
took
an
extreme
case
one
hare
and
an
infinite
number
of
tortoises
an
extreme
case
indeed
her
aunt
remarked
with
admirable
gravity
and
a
most
dangerous
state
of
things
and
i
thought
if
i
went
with
a
tortoise
there
would
be
only
hare
to
meet
but
if
i
went
with
the
hare
you
know
there
were
of
tortoises
it
was
a
bad
idea
said
the
elder
lady
as
they
left
the
cab
at
the
entrance
of
burlington
house
you
shall
have
another
chance
we
have
a
match
in
marking
pictures
clara
brightened
up
i
should
like
to
try
again
very
much
she
said
i
take
more
care
this
time
how
are
we
to
play
to
this
question
mad
mathesis
made
no
reply
she
was
busy
drawing
lines
down
the
margins
of
the
catalogue
see
she
said
after
a
minute
drawn
three
columns
against
the
names
of
the
pictures
in
the
long
room
and
i
want
you
to
fill
them
with
oughts
and
crosses
crosses
for
good
marks
and
oughts
for
bad
the
first
column
is
for
choice
of
subject
the
second
for
arrangement
the
third
for
colouring
and
these
are
the
conditions
of
the
match
you
must
give
three
crosses
to
two
or
three
pictures
you
must
give
two
crosses
to
four
or
five
do
you
mean
two
crosses
said
clara
or
may
i
count
the
pictures
among
the
pictures
of
course
you
may
said
her
aunt
any
one
that
has
eyes
may
be
said
to
have
eyes
i
suppose
clara
followed
her
aunt
dreamy
gaze
across
the
crowded
gallery
to
find
that
there
was
a
person
in
sight
and
you
must
give
one
cross
to
nine
or
ten
and
which
wins
the
match
clara
asked
as
she
carefully
entered
these
conditions
on
a
blank
leaf
in
her
catalogue
whichever
marks
fewest
pictures
but
suppose
we
marked
the
same
number
then
whichever
uses
most
marks
clara
considered
i
do
think
it
much
of
a
match
she
said
i
shall
mark
nine
pictures
and
give
three
crosses
to
three
of
them
two
crosses
to
two
more
and
one
cross
each
to
all
the
rest
will
you
indeed
said
her
aunt
wait
till
you
heard
all
the
conditions
my
impetuous
child
you
must
give
three
oughts
to
one
or
two
pictures
two
oughts
to
three
or
four
and
one
ought
to
eight
or
nine
i
do
want
you
to
be
hard
on
the
clara
quite
gasped
as
she
wrote
down
all
these
fresh
conditions
it
a
great
deal
worse
than
circulating
decimals
she
said
but
determined
to
win
all
the
same
her
aunt
smiled
grimly
we
can
begin
she
said
as
they
paused
before
a
gigantic
picture
which
the
catalogue
informed
them
was
the
portrait
of
lieutenant
brown
mounted
on
his
favorite
elephant
he
looks
awfully
conceited
said
clara
i
do
think
he
was
the
elephant
favorite
lieutenant
what
a
hideous
picture
it
is
and
it
takes
up
room
enough
for
twenty
mind
what
you
say
my
dear
her
aunt
interposed
it
by
an
but
clara
was
quite
reckless
i
do
care
who
it
by
she
cried
and
i
shall
give
it
three
bad
marks
aunt
and
niece
soon
drifted
away
from
each
other
in
the
crowd
and
for
the
next
clara
was
hard
at
work
putting
in
marks
and
rubbing
them
out
again
and
hunting
up
and
down
for
suitable
pictures
this
she
found
the
hardest
part
of
all
i
find
the
one
i
want
she
exclaimed
at
last
almost
crying
with
vexation
what
is
it
you
want
to
find
my
dear
the
voice
was
strange
to
clara
but
so
sweet
and
gentle
that
she
felt
attracted
to
the
owner
of
it
even
before
she
had
seen
her
and
when
she
turned
and
met
the
smiling
looks
of
two
little
old
ladies
whose
round
dimpled
faces
exactly
alike
seemed
never
to
have
known
a
care
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
as
she
confessed
to
aunt
mattie
afterwards
to
keep
herself
from
hugging
them
both
i
was
looking
for
a
picture
she
said
that
has
a
good
subject
and
that
well
arranged
but
badly
coloured
the
little
old
ladies
glanced
at
each
other
in
some
alarm
calm
yourself
my
dear
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
first
and
try
to
remember
which
it
was
what
the
subject
was
it
an
elephant
for
instance
the
other
sister
suggested
they
were
still
in
sight
of
lieutenant
brown
i
do
know
indeed
clara
impetuously
replied
you
know
it
matter
a
bit
what
the
subject
so
long
as
it
a
good
one
once
more
the
sisters
exchanged
looks
of
alarm
and
one
of
them
whispered
something
to
the
other
of
which
clara
caught
only
the
one
word
mad
they
mean
aunt
mattie
of
course
she
said
to
herself
fancying
in
her
innocence
that
london
was
like
her
native
town
where
everybody
knew
everybody
else
if
you
mean
my
aunt
she
added
aloud
just
three
pictures
beyond
lieutenant
brown
ah
well
then
you
better
go
to
her
my
dear
her
new
friend
said
soothingly
find
you
the
picture
you
want
dear
dear
echoed
the
other
sister
mind
you
do
lose
sight
of
your
aunt
and
the
pair
trotted
off
into
another
room
leaving
clara
rather
perplexed
at
their
manner
they
real
darlings
she
soliloquised
i
wonder
why
they
pity
me
so
and
she
wandered
on
murmuring
to
herself
it
must
have
two
good
marks
and
knot
vi
her
radiancy
one
piecee
thing
that
my
have
got
maskee
a
that
thing
my
no
can
do
you
talkee
you
no
sabey
what
bamboo
they
landed
and
were
at
once
conducted
to
the
palace
about
half
way
they
were
met
by
the
governor
who
welcomed
them
in
english
a
great
relief
to
our
travellers
whose
guide
could
speak
nothing
but
kgovjnian
i
do
half
like
the
way
they
grin
at

as
we
go
by
the
old
man
whispered
to
his
son
and
why
do
they
say
so
often
it
alludes
to
a
local
custom
replied
the
governor
who
had
overheard
the
question
such
persons
as
happen
in
any
way
to
displease
her
radiancy
are
usually
beaten
with
rods
illustration
why
do
they
say
so
often
the
old
man
shuddered
a
most
objectional
local
custom
he
remarked
with
strong
emphasis
i
wish
we
had
never
landed
did
you
notice
that
black
fellow
norman
opening
his
great
mouth
at
us
i
verily
believe
he
would
like
to
eat
us
norman
appealed
to
the
governor
who
was
walking
at
his
other
side
do
they
often
eat
distinguished
strangers
here
he
said
in
as
indifferent
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
not
often
not
ever
was
the
welcome
reply
they
are
not
good
for
it
pigs
we
eat
for
they
are
fat
this
old
man
is
thin
and
thankful
to
be
so
muttered
the
elder
traveller
beaten
we
shall
be
without
a
doubt
it
a
comfort
to
know
it
wo
be
beaten
without
the

my
dear
boy
just
look
at
the
peacocks
they
were
now
walking
between
two
unbroken
lines
of
those
gorgeous
birds
each
held
in
check
by
means
of
a
golden
collar
and
chain
by
a
black
slave
who
stood
well
behind
so
as
not
to
interrupt
the
view
of
the
glittering
tail
with
its
network
of
rustling
feathers
and
its
hundred
eyes
the
governor
smiled
proudly
in
your
honour
he
said
her
radiancy
has
ordered
up
ten
thousand
additional
peacocks
she
will
no
doubt
decorate
you
before
you
go
with
the
usual
star
and
feathers
it
be
star
without
the

faltered
one
of
his
hearers
come
come
do
lose
heart
said
the
other
all
this
is
full
of
charm
for
me
you
are
young
norman
sighed
his
father
young
and
for
me
it
is
charm
without
the
the
old
one
is
sad
the
governor
remarked
with
some
anxiety
he
has
without
doubt
effected
some
fearful
crime
but
i
have
the
poor
old
gentleman
hastily
exclaimed
tell
him
i
have
norman
he
has
not
as
yet
norman
gently
explained
and
the
governor
repeated
in
a
satisfied
tone
not
as
yet
yours
is
a
wondrous
country
the
governor
resumed
after
a
pause
now
here
is
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
mine
a
merchant
in
london
he
and
his
brother
went
there
a
year
ago
with
a
thousand
pounds
apiece
and
on
they
had
sixty
thousand
pounds
between
them
how
did
they
do
it
norman
eagerly
exclaimed
even
the
elder
traveller
looked
excited
the
governor
handed
him
the
open
letter
anybody
can
do
it
when
once
they
know
how
so
ran
this
oracular
document
we
borrowed
nought
we
stole
nought
we
began
the
year
with
only
a
thousand
pounds
apiece
and
last
we
had
sixty
thousand
pounds
between
us
sixty
thousand
golden
sovereigns
norman
looked
grave
and
thoughtful
as
he
handed
back
the
letter
his
father
hazarded
one
guess
was
it
by
gambling
a
kgovjnian
never
gambles
said
the
governor
gravely
as
he
ushered
them
through
the
palace
gates
they
followed
him
in
silence
down
a
long
passage
and
soon
found
themselves
in
a
lofty
hall
lined
entirely
with
peacocks
feathers
in
the
centre
was
a
pile
of
crimson
cushions
which
almost
concealed
the
figure
of
her
radiancy
a
plump
little
damsel
in
a
robe
of
green
satin
dotted
with
silver
stars
whose
pale
round
face
lit
up
for
a
moment
with
a
as
the
travellers
bowed
before
her
and
then
relapsed
into
the
exact
expression
of
a
wax
doll
while
she
languidly
murmured
a
word
or
two
in
the
kgovjnian
dialect
the
governor
interpreted
her
radiancy
welcomes
you
she
notes
the
impenetrable
placidity
of
the
old
one
and
the
imperceptible
acuteness
of
the
youth
here
the
little
potentate
clapped
her
hands
and
a
troop
of
slaves
instantly
appeared
carrying
trays
of
coffee
and
sweetmeats
which
they
offered
to
the
guests
who
had
at
a
signal
from
the
governor
seated
themselves
on
the
carpet
muttered
the
old
man
one
might
as
well
be
at
a
confectioner
ask
for
a
penny
bun
norman
not
so
loud
his
son
whispered
say
something
complimentary
for
the
governor
was
evidently
expecting
a
speech
we
thank
her
exalted
potency
the
old
man
timidly
began
we
bask
in
the
light
of
her
smile
which
the
words
of
old
men
are
weak
the
governor
interrupted
angrily
let
the
youth
speak
tell
her
cried
norman
in
a
wild
burst
of
eloquence
that
like
two
grasshoppers
in
a
volcano
we
are
shrivelled
up
in
the
presence
of
her
spangled
vehemence
it
is
well
said
the
governor
and
translated
this
into
kgovjnian
i
am
now
to
tell
you
he
proceeded
what
her
radiancy
requires
of
you
before
you
go
the
yearly
competition
for
the
post
of
imperial
is
just
ended
you
are
the
judges
you
will
take
account
of
the
rate
of
work
the
lightness
of
the
scarves
and
their
warmth
usually
the
competitors
differ
in
one
point
only
thus
last
year
fifi
and
gogo
made
the
same
number
of
scarves
in
the
and
they
were
equally
light
but
fifi
were
twice
as
warm
as
gogo
and
she
was
pronounced
twice
as
good
but
this
year
woe
is
me
who
can
judge
it
three
competitors
are
here
and
they
differ
in
all
points
while
you
settle
their
claims
you
shall
be
lodged
her
radiancy
bids
me
say
free
of
expense
in
the
best
dungeon
and
abundantly
fed
on
the
best
bread
and
water
the
old
man
groaned
all
is
lost
he
wildly
exclaimed
but
norman
heeded
him
not
he
had
taken
out
his
and
was
calmly
jotting
down
the
particulars
three
they
be
the
governor
proceeded
lolo
mimi
and
zuzu
lolo
makes
scarves
while
mimi
makes
but
zuzu
makes
while
lolo
makes
again
so
fairylike
is
zuzu
handiwork
of
her
scarves
weigh
no
more
than
one
of
lolo
yet
mimi
is
lighter
still
of
hers
will
but
balance
of
zuzu
and
for
warmth
one
of
mimi
is
equal
to
of
zuzu
yet
one
of
lolo
is
as
warm
as
of
mimi
here
the
little
lady
once
more
clapped
her
hands
it
is
our
signal
of
dismissal
the
governor
hastily
said
pay
her
radiancy
your
farewell
compliments
and
walk
out
backwards
the
walking
part
was
all
the
elder
tourist
could
manage
norman
simply
said
tell
her
radiancy
we
are
transfixed
by
the
spectacle
of
her
serene
brilliance
and
bid
an
agonized
farewell
to
her
condensed
milkiness
her
radiancy
is
pleased
the
governor
reported
after
duly
translating
this
she
casts
on
you
a
glance
from
her
imperial
eyes
and
is
confident
that
you
will
catch
it
that
i
warrant
we
shall
the
elder
traveller
moaned
to
himself
distractedly
once
more
they
bowed
low
and
then
followed
the
governor
down
a
winding
staircase
to
the
imperial
dungeon
which
they
found
to
be
lined
with
coloured
marble
lighted
from
the
roof
and
splendidly
though
not
luxuriously
furnished
with
a
bench
of
polished
malachite
i
trust
you
will
not
delay
the
calculation
the
governor
said
ushering
them
in
with
much
ceremony
i
have
known
great
inconvenience
great
and
serious
inconvenience
result
to
those
unhappy
ones
who
have
delayed
to
execute
the
commands
of
her
radiancy
and
on
this
occasion
she
is
resolute
she
says
the
thing
must
and
shall
be
done
and
she
has
ordered
up
ten
thousand
additional
bamboos
with
these
words
he
left
them
and
they
heard
him
lock
and
bar
the
door
on
the
outside
i
told
you
how
it
would
end
moaned
the
elder
traveller
wringing
his
hands
and
quite
forgetting
in
his
anguish
that
he
had
himself
proposed
the
expedition
and
had
never
predicted
anything
of
the
sort
oh
that
we
were

clara
voice
took
the
plaintive
tone
that
her
aunt
never
knew
how
to
resist
and
with
a
sigh
the
old
lady
drew
forth
her
ivory
tablets
and
prepared
to
record
the
amount
that
clara
had
just
spent
at
the
confectioner
shop
her
expenditure
was
always
made
out
of
her
purse
but
the
poor
girl
knew
by
bitter
experience
that
sooner
or
later
mad
mathesis
would
expect
an
exact
account
of
every
penny
that
had
gone
and
she
waited
with
impatience
while
the
old
lady
turned
the
tablets
over
and
over
till
she
had
found
the
one
headed

said
at

tossed

head
like
her
impudence

for
one
glass
of

clara
was
beginning
to
say
when
suddenly
the
cab
drew
up
and
a
courteous
was
handing
out
the
bewildered
girl
before
she
had
had
time
to
finish
her
sentence
her
aunt
pocketed
the
tablets
instantly
business
first
she
said
petty
cash
which
is
a
form
of
pleasure
whatever
may
think
afterwards
and
she
proceeded
to
pay
the
driver
and
to
give
voluminous
orders
about
the
luggage
quite
deaf
to
the
entreaties
of
her
unhappy
niece
that
she
would
enter
the
rest
of
the
luncheon
account
my
dear
you
really
must
cultivate
a
more
capacious
mind
was
all
the
consolation
she
vouchsafed
to
the
poor
girl
are
not
the
tablets
of
your
memory
wide
enough
to
contain
the
record
of
one
single
luncheon
not
wide
enough
not
half
wide
enough
was
the
passionate
reply
the
words
came
in
aptly
enough
but
the
voice
was
not
that
of
clara
and
both
ladies
turned
in
some
surprise
to
see
who
it
was
that
had
so
suddenly
struck
into
their
conversation
a
fat
little
old
lady
was
standing
at
the
door
of
a
cab
helping
the
driver
to
extricate
what
seemed
an
exact
duplicate
of
herself
it
would
have
been
no
easy
task
to
decide
which
was
the
fatter
or
which
looked
the
more
of
the
two
sisters
i
tell
you
the
is
half
wide
enough
she
repeated
as
her
sister
finally
emerged
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
pellet
from
a
and
she
turned
to
appeal
to
clara
is
it
dear
she
said
trying
hard
to
bring
a
frown
into
a
face
that
dimpled
all
over
with
smiles
some
folks
is
too
wide
for
growled
the
illustration
i
tell
you
the
is
half
wide
enough
do
provoke
me
man
cried
the
little
old
lady
in
what
she
meant
for
a
tempest
of
fury
say
another
word
and
i
put
you
into
the
county
court
and
sue
you
for
a
the
cabman
touched
his
hat
and
marched
off
grinning
nothing
like
a
little
law
to
cow
the
ruffians
my
dear
she
remarked
confidentially
to
clara
you
saw
how
he
quailed
when
i
mentioned
the
not
that
i
any
idea
what
it
means
but
it
sounds
very
grand
does
it
it
very
provoking
clara
replied
a
little
vaguely
very
the
little
old
lady
eagerly
repeated
and
we
very
much
provoked
indeed
are
we
sister
i
never
was
so
provoked
in
all
my
life
the
fatter
sister
assented
radiantly
by
this
time
clara
had
recognised
her
acquaintances
and
drawing
her
aunt
aside
she
hastily
whispered
her
reminiscences
i
met
them
first
in
the
royal
academy
and
they
were
very
kind
to
me
and
they
were
lunching
at
the
next
table
to
us
just
now
you
know
and
they
tried
to
help
me
to
find
the
picture
i
wanted
and
i
sure
they
dear
old
things
friends
of
yours
are
they
said
mad
mathesis
well
i
like
their
looks
you
can
be
civil
to
them
while
i
get
the
tickets
but
do
try
and
arrange
your
ideas
a
little
more
chronologically
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
four
ladies
found
themselves
seated
side
by
side
on
the
same
bench
waiting
for
the
train
and
chatting
as
if
they
had
known
one
another
for
years
now
this
i
call
quite
a
remarkable
coincidence
exclaimed
the
smaller
and
more
talkative
of
the
two
sisters
the
one
whose
legal
knowledge
had
annihilated
the
not
only
that
we
should
be
waiting
for
the
same
train
and
at
the
same
station
would
be
curious
enough
but
actually
on
the
same
day
and
the
same
hour
of
the
day
that
what
strikes
so
forcibly
she
glanced
at
the
fatter
and
more
silent
sister
whose
chief
function
in
life
seemed
to
be
to
support
the
family
opinion
and
who
meekly
responded
and
me
too
sister
those
are
not
coincidences
mad
mathesis
was
just
beginning
when
clara
ventured
to
interpose
there
no
jolting
here
she
pleaded
meekly
you
mind
writing
it
down
now
out
came
the
ivory
tablets
once
more
what
was
it
then
said
her
aunt
one
glass
of
lemonade
one
sandwich
one
biscuit
oh
dear
me
cried
poor
clara
the
historical
tone
suddenly
changing
to
a
wail
of
agony
toothache
said
her
aunt
calmly
as
she
wrote
down
the
items
the
two
sisters
instantly
opened
their
reticules
and
produced
two
different
remedies
for
neuralgia
each
marked
unequalled
it
is
that
said
poor
clara
thank
you
very
much
it
only
that
i
remember
how
much
i
paid
well
try
and
make
it
out
then
said
her
aunt
you
got
yesterday
luncheon
to
help
you
you
know
and
here
the
luncheon
we
had
the
day
before
the
first
day
we
went
to
that
shop
glass
she
handed
the
tablets
to
clara
who
gazed
at
them
with
eyes
so
dim
with
tears
that
she
did
not
at
first
notice
that
she
was
holding
them
upside
down
the
two
sisters
had
been
listening
to
all
this
with
the
deepest
interest
and
at
this
juncture
the
smaller
one
softly
laid
her
hand
on
clara
arm
do
you
know
my
dear
she
said
coaxingly
my
sister
and
i
are
in
the
very
same
predicament
quite
identically
the
very
same
predicament
are
we
sister
quite
identically
and
absolutely
the
very
began
the
fatter
sister
but
she
was
constructing
her
sentence
on
too
large
a
scale
and
the
little
one
would
not
wait
for
her
to
finish
it
yes
my
dear
she
resumed
we
were
lunching
at
the
very
same
shop
as
you
were
and
we
had
two
glasses
of
lemonade
and
three
sandwiches
and
five
biscuits
and
neither
of
us
has
the
least
idea
what
we
paid
have
we
sister
quite
identically
and
absolutely
murmured
the
other
who
evidently
considered
that
she
was
now
a
whole
sentence
in
arrears
and
that
she
ought
to
discharge
one
obligation
before
contracting
any
fresh
liabilities
but
the
little
lady
broke
in
again
and
she
retired
from
the
conversation
a
bankrupt
you
make
it
out
for
us
my
dear
pleaded
the
little
old
lady
you
can
do
arithmetic
i
trust
her
aunt
said
a
little
anxiously
as
clara
turned
from
one
tablet
to
another
vainly
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
her
mind
was
a
blank
and
all
human
expression
was
rapidly
fading
out
of
her
face
a
gloomy
silence
ensued

start
every
quarter
of
an
hour
both
ways
would
you
mind
repeating
that
word
said
norman
grurm
grurmstipths
the
governor
repeated
you
call
them
omnibuses
in
england
they
run
both
ways
and
you
can
travel
by
one
of
them
all
the
way
down
to
the
harbour
the
old
man
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
four
hours
of
courtly
ceremony
had
wearied
him
and
he
had
been
in
constant
terror
lest
something
should
call
into
use
the
ten
thousand
additional
bamboos
in
another
minute
they
were
crossing
a
large
quadrangle
paved
with
marble
and
tastefully
decorated
with
a
pigsty
in
each
corner
soldiers
carrying
pigs
were
marching
in
all
directions
and
in
the
middle
stood
a
gigantic
officer
giving
orders
in
a
voice
of
thunder
which
made
itself
heard
above
all
the
uproar
of
the
pigs
it
is
the
the
governor
hurriedly
whispered
to
his
companions
who
at
once
followed
his
example
in
prostrating
themselves
before
the
great
man
the
commander
gravely
bowed
in
return
he
was
covered
with
gold
lace
from
head
to
foot
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
deep
misery
and
he
had
a
little
black
pig
under
each
arm
still
the
gallant
fellow
did
his
best
in
the
midst
of
the
orders
he
was
every
moment
issuing
to
his
men
to
bid
a
courteous
farewell
to
the
departing
guests
farewell
oh
old
one
carry
these
three
to
the
south
corner
and
farewell
to
thee
thou
young
one
put
this
fat
one
on
the
top
of
the
others
in
the
western
sty
may
your
shadows
never
be
less
woe
is
me
it
is
wrongly
done
empty
out
all
the
sties
and
begin
again
and
the
soldier
leant
upon
his
sword
and
wiped
away
a
tear
he
is
in
distress
the
governor
explained
as
they
left
the
court
her
radiancy
has
commanded
him
to
place
pigs
in
those
four
sties
so
that
as
she
goes
round
the
court
she
may
always
find
the
number
in
each
sty
nearer
to
ten
than
the
number
in
the
last
does
she
call
ten
nearer
to
ten
than
nine
is
said
norman
surely
said
the
governor
her
radiancy
would
admit
that
ten
is
nearer
to
ten
than
nine
is
and
also
nearer
than
eleven
is
then
i
think
it
can
be
done
said
norman
the
governor
shook
his
head
the
commander
has
been
transferring
them
in
vain
for
four
months
he
said
what
hope
remains
and
her
radiancy
has
ordered
up
ten
thousand
additional
the
pigs
do
seem
to
enjoy
being
transferred
the
old
man
hastily
interrupted
he
did
not
like
the
subject
of
bamboos
they
are
only
transferred
you
know
said
the
governor
in
most
cases
they
are
immediately
carried
back
again
so
they
need
not
mind
it
and
all
is
done
with
the
greatest
care
under
the
personal
superintendence
of
the
of
course
she
would
only
go
round
said
norman
alas
no
sighed
their
conductor
round
and
round
round
and
round
these
are
her
radiancy
own
words
but
oh
agony
here
is
the
outer
gate
and
we
must
part
he
sobbed
as
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
the
next
moment
was
briskly
walking
away
he
have
waited
to
see
us
off
said
the
old
man
piteously
and
he
need
have
begun
whistling
the
very
he
left
us
said
the
young
one
severely
but
look
sharp
here
are
two
in
the
act
of
starting
unluckily
the
omnibus
was
full
never
mind
said
norman
cheerily
we
walk
on
till
the
next
one
overtakes
us
they
trudged
on
in
silence
both
thinking
over
the
military
problem
till
they
met
an
omnibus
coming
from
the
sea
the
elder
traveller
took
out
his
watch
just
twelve
minutes
and
a
half
since
we
started
he
remarked
in
an
absent
manner
suddenly
the
vacant
face
brightened
the
old
man
had
an
idea
my
boy
he
shouted
bringing
his
hand
down
upon
norman
shoulder
so
suddenly
as
for
a
moment
to
transfer
his
centre
of
gravity
beyond
the
base
of
support
thus
taken
off
his
guard
the
young
man
wildly
staggered
forwards
and
seemed
about
to
plunge
into
space
but
in
another
moment
he
had
gracefully
recovered
himself
problem
in
precession
and
nutation
he
remarked
in
tones
where
filial
respect
only
just
managed
to
conceal
a
shade
of
annoyance
what
is
it
he
hastily
added
fearing
his
father
might
have
been
taken
will
you
have
some
brandy
when
will
the
next
omnibus
overtake
us
when
when
the
old
man
cried
growing
more
excited
every
moment
norman
looked
gloomy
give
me
time
he
said
i
must
think
it
over
and
once
more
the
travellers
passed
on
in
silence
a
silence
only
broken
by
the
distant
squeals
of
the
unfortunate
little
pigs
who
were
still
being
provisionally
transferred
from
sty
to
sty
under
the
personal
superintendence
of
the
knot
ix
a
serpent
with
corners
water
water
every
where
nor
any
drop
to
drink
it
just
take
one
more
pebble
what
ever
you
doing
with
those
buckets
the
speakers
were
hugh
and
lambert
place
the
beach
of
little
mendip
time
hugh
was
floating
a
bucket
in
another
a
size
larger
and
trying
how
many
pebbles
it
would
carry
without
sinking
lambert
was
lying
on
his
back
doing
nothing
for
the
next
minute
or
two
hugh
was
silent
evidently
deep
in
thought
suddenly
he
started
i
say
look
here
lambert
he
cried
if
it
alive
and
slimy
and
with
legs
i
do
care
to
said
lambert
did
balbus
say
this
morning
that
if
a
body
is
immersed
in
liquid
it
displaces
as
much
liquid
as
is
equal
to
its
own
bulk
said
hugh
he
said
things
of
that
sort
lambert
vaguely
replied
well
just
look
here
a
minute
here
the
little
bucket
almost
quite
immersed
so
the
water
displaced
ought
to
be
just
about
the
same
bulk
and
now
just
look
at
it
he
took
out
the
little
bucket
as
he
spoke
and
handed
the
big
one
to
lambert
why
there
hardly
a
teacupful
do
you
mean
to
say
water
is
the
same
bulk
as
the
little
bucket
course
it
is
said
lambert
well
look
here
again
cried
hugh
triumphantly
as
he
poured
the
water
from
the
big
bucket
into
the
little
one
why
it
does
half
fill
it
that
business
said
lambert
if
balbus
says
it
the
same
bulk
why
it
the
same
bulk
you
know
well
i
do
believe
it
said
hugh
you
need
said
lambert
besides
it
come
along
they
found
balbus
waiting
dinner
for
them
and
to
him
hugh
at
once
propounded
his
difficulty
let
get
you
helped
first
said
balbus
briskly
cutting
away
at
the
joint
you
know
the
old
proverb
first
mechanics
afterwards
the
boys
did
know
the
proverb
but
they
accepted
it
in
perfect
good
faith
as
they
did
every
piece
of
information
however
startling
that
came
from
so
infallible
an
authority
as
their
tutor
they
ate
on
steadily
in
silence
and
when
dinner
was
over
hugh
set
out
the
usual
array
of
pens
ink
and
paper
while
balbus
repeated
to
them
the
problem
he
had
prepared
for
their
afternoon
task
a
friend
of
mine
has
a
a
very
pretty
one
though
no
great
size
how
big
is
it
said
hugh
that
what
have
to
find
out
balbus
gaily
replied
all
tell
you
is
that
it
is
oblong
in
shape
just
half
a
yard
longer
than
its
width
and
that
a
one
yard
wide
begins
at
one
corner
and
runs
all
round
it
joining
into
itself
said
hugh
joining
into
itself
young
man
just
before
doing
it
turns
a
corner
and
runs
round
the
garden
again
alongside
of
the
first
portion
and
then
inside
that
again
winding
in
and
in
and
each
lap
touching
the
last
one
till
it
has
used
up
the
whole
of
the
area
like
a
serpent
with
corners
said
lambert
exactly
so
and
if
you
walk
the
whole
length
of
it
to
the
last
inch
keeping
in
the
centre
of
the
path
it
exactly
two
miles
and
half
a
furlong
now
while
you
find
out
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
garden
i
see
if
i
can
think
out
that
puzzle
you
said
it
was
a
hugh
inquired
as
balbus
was
leaving
the
room
i
did
said
balbus
where
do
the
flowers
grow
said
hugh
but
balbus
thought
it
best
not
to
hear
the
question
he
left
the
boys
to
their
problem
and
in
the
silence
of
his
own
room
set
himself
to
unravel
hugh
mechanical
paradox
to
fix
our
thoughts
he
murmured
to
himself
as
with
hands
in
his
pockets
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
we
will
take
a
cylindrical
glass
jar
with
a
scale
of
inches
marked
up
the
side
and
fill
it
with
water
up
to
the
mark
and
we
will
assume
that
every
inch
depth
of
jar
contains
a
pint
of
water
we
will
now
take
a
solid
cylinder
such
that
every
inch
of
it
is
equal
in
bulk
to
a
pint
of
water
and
plunge
inches
of
it
into
the
water
so
that
the
end
of
the
cylinder
comes
down
to
the
mark
well
that
displaces
pints
of
water
what
becomes
of
them
why
if
there
were
no
more
cylinder
they
would
lie
comfortably
on
the
top
and
fill
the
jar
up
to
the
mark
but
unfortunately
there
more
cylinder
occupying
half
the
space
between
the
and
the
marks
so
that
only
pint
of
water
can
be
accommodated
there
what
becomes
of
the
other
pint
why
if
there
were
no
more
cylinder
it
would
lie
on
the
top
and
fill
the
jar
up
to
the
mark
but
unfortunately
shade
of
newton
he
exclaimed
in
sudden
accents
of
terror
when
the
water
stop
rising
a
bright
idea
struck
him
i
write
a
little
essay
on
it
he
said
when
a
solid
is
immersed
in
a
liquid
it
is
well
known
that
it
displaces
a
portion
of
the
liquid
equal
to
itself
in
bulk
and
that
the
level
of
the
liquid
rises
just
so
much
as
it
would
rise
if
a
quantity
of
liquid
had
been
added
to
it
equal
in
bulk
to
the
solid
lardner
says
precisely
the
same
process
occurs
when
a
solid
is
immersed
the
quantity
of
liquid
displaced
in
this
case
equalling
the
portion
of
the
solid
which
is
immersed
and
the
rise
of
the
level
being
in
proportion
suppose
a
solid
held
above
the
surface
of
a
liquid
and
partially
immersed
a
portion
of
the
liquid
is
displaced
and
the
level
of
the
liquid
rises
but
by
this
rise
of
level
a
little
bit
more
of
the
solid
is
of
course
immersed
and
so
there
is
a
new
displacement
of
a
second
portion
of
the
liquid
and
a
consequent
rise
of
level
again
this
second
rise
of
level
causes
a
yet
further
immersion
and
by
consequence
another
displacement
of
liquid
and
another
rise
it
is
that
this
process
must
continue
till
the
entire
solid
is
immersed
and
that
the
liquid
will
then
begin
to
immerse
whatever
holds
the
solid
which
being
connected
with
it
must
for
the
time
be
considered
a
part
of
it
if
you
hold
a
stick
six
feet
long
with
its
end
in
a
tumbler
of
water
and
wait
long
enough
you
must
eventually
be
immersed
the
question
as
to
the
source
from
which
the
water
is
supplied
which
belongs
to
a
high
branch
of
mathematics
and
is
therefore
beyond
our
present
scope
does
not
apply
to
the
sea
let
us
therefore
take
the
familiar
instance
of
a
man
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
at
with
a
solid
in
his
hand
which
he
partially
immerses
he
remains
steadfast
and
unmoved
and
we
all
know
that
he
must
be
drowned
the
multitudes
who
daily
perish
in
this
manner
to
attest
a
philosophical
truth
and
whose
bodies
the
unreasoning
wave
casts
sullenly
upon
our
thankless
shores
have
a
truer
claim
to
be
called
the
martyrs
of
science
than
a
galileo
or
a
kepler
to
use
kossuth
eloquent
phrase
they
are
the
unnamed
demigods
of
the
nineteenth
century
b
there
a
fallacy
he
murmured
drowsily
as
he
stretched
his
long
legs
upon
the
sofa
i
must
think
it
over
again
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
concentrate
his
attention
more
perfectly
and
for
the
next
hour
or
so
his
slow
and
regular
breathing
bore
witness
to
the
careful
deliberation
with
which
he
was
investigating
this
new
and
perplexing
view
of
the
subject
illustration
he
remains
steadfast
and
unmoved

old
song
how
very
very
sad
exclaimed
clara
and
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
girl
filled
with
tears
as
she
spoke
sad
but
very
curious
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
arithmetically
was
her

reply
some
of

lost
an

in

service
some
a

some
an

some
an

and
some
perhaps
clara
murmured
dreamily
as
they
passed
the
long
rows
of
heroes
basking
in
the
sun
did
you
notice
that
very
old
one
with
a
red
face
who
was
drawing
a
map
in
the
dust
with
his
wooden
leg
and
all
the
others
watching
i
it
was
a
plan
of
a
battle
the
battle
of
trafalgar
no
doubt
her
aunt
interrupted
briskly
hardly
that
i
think
clara
ventured
to
say
you
see
in
that
case
he
could
well
be
alive
could
well
be
alive
the
old
lady
contemptuously
repeated
he
as
lively
as
you
and
me
put
together
why
if
drawing
a
map
in
the
dust
with
one
wooden
leg
does
prove
one
to
be
alive
perhaps
you
kindly
mention
what
prove
it

did
not
see
her
way
out
of
it

had
never
been
her
to
return
to
the
arithmetic
mad
mathesis
resumed
the
eccentric
old
lady
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
driving
her
niece
into
a
calculation
what
percentage
do
you
suppose
must
have
lost
all
four
a
leg
an
arm
an
eye
and
an
ear
how
i
tell
gasped
the
terrified
girl
she
knew
well
what
was
coming
you
ca
of
course
without
her
aunt
replied
but
i
just
going
to
give
you
give
her
a
chelsea
bun
miss
that
what
most
young
ladies
likes
best
the
voice
was
rich
and
musical
and
the
speaker
dexterously
whipped
back
the
snowy
cloth
that
covered
his
basket
and
disclosed
a
tempting
array
of
the
familiar
square
buns
joined
together
in
rows
richly
egged
and
browned
and
glistening
in
the
sun
no
sir
i
shall
give
her
nothing
so
indigestible
be
off
the
old
lady
waved
her
parasol
threateningly
but
nothing
seemed
to
disturb
the
of
the
jolly
old
man
who
marched
on
chanting
his
melodious

my

said
the

percentages
will
agree
with
you
ever

much
better
clara
sighed
and
there
was
a
hungry
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
watched
the
basket
lessening
in
the
distance
but
she
meekly
listened
to
the
relentless
old
lady
who
at
once
proceeded
to
count
off
the
on
her
fingers
say
that
per
cent
have
lost
an
eye
per

an

per

an

a

that
do
it
beautifully
now
my
dear
what

must
have
lost
all
four
no
more
conversation
occurred
unless
a
smothered
exclamation
of
piping
hot
which
escaped
from
clara
lips
as
the
basket
vanished
round
a
corner
could
be
counted
as
such
until
they
reached
the
old
chelsea
mansion
where
clara
father
was
then
staying
with
his
three
sons
and
their
old
tutor
balbus
lambert
and
hugh
had
entered
the
house
only
a
few
minutes
before
them
they
had
been
out
walking
and
hugh
had
been
propounding
a
difficulty
which
had
reduced
lambert
to
the
depths
of
gloom
and
had
even
puzzled
balbus
it
changes
from
wednesday
to
thursday
at
midnight
does
it
hugh
had
begun
sometimes
said
balbus
cautiously
always
said
lambert
decisively
balbus
gently
insisted
six
midnights
out
of
seven
it
changes
to
some

i
meant
of
course
hugh
corrected
himself
when
it
change
from
wednesday
to
thursday
it
does
it
at
midnight
and
at
midnight
surely
said
balbus
lambert
was
silent
well
now
suppose
it
midnight
here
in
chelsea
then
it
wednesday
of
chelsea
say
in
ireland
or
america
where
midnight
arrived
yet
and
it
thursday
of
chelsea
say
in
germany
or
russia
where
midnight
has
just
passed
by
surely
balbus
said
again
even
lambert
nodded
this
time
but
it
is
midnight
anywhere
else
so
it
ca
be
changing
from
one
day
to
another
anywhere
else
and
yet
if
ireland
and
america
and
so
on
call
it
wednesday
and
germany
and
russia
and
so
on
call
it
thursday
there
be
some
place
not
chelsea
that
has
different
days
on
the
two
sides
of
it
and
the
worst
of
it
is
the
people
get
their
days
in
the
wrong
order
they
got
wednesday
of
them
and
thursday
just
as
if
their
day
had
changed
from
thursday
to
wednesday
i
heard
that
puzzle
before
cried
lambert
and
i
tell
you
the
explanation
when
a
ship
goes
round
the
world
from
east
to
west
we
know
that
it
loses
a
day
in
its
reckoning
so
that
when
it
gets
home
and
calls
its
day
wednesday
it
finds
people
here
calling
it
thursday
because
we
had
one
more
midnight
than
the
ship
has
had
and
when
you
go
the
other
way
round
you
gain
a
day
i
know
all
that
said
hugh
in
reply
to
this
not
very
lucid
explanation
but
it
does
help
me
because
the
ship
has
proper
days
one
way
round
you
get
more
than
hours
to
the
day
and
the
other
way
you
get
less
so
of
course
the
names
get
wrong
but
people
that
live
on
in
one
place
always
get
hours
to
the
day
i
suppose
there
such
a
place
balbus
said
meditatively
though
i
never
heard
of
it
and
the
people
must
find
it
very
queer
as
hugh
says
to
have
the
old
day
of
them
and
the
new
one
because
when
midnight
comes
round
to
them
with
the
new
day
in
front
of
it
and
the
old
one
behind
it
one
does
see
exactly
what
happens
i
must
think
it
over
so
they
had
entered
the
house
in
the
state
i
have
described
balbus
puzzled
and
lambert
buried
in
gloomy
thought
yes
m
master
at
home
m
said
the
stately
old
butler
it
is
only
a
butler
of
experience
who
can
manage
a
series
of
three
m
together
without
any
interjacent
vowels
and
the
party
is
for
you
in
the
libery
i
do
like
his
calling
your
father
an
party
mad
mathesis
whispered
to
her
niece
as
they
crossed
the
hall
and
clara
had
only
just
time
to
whisper
in
reply
he
meant
the
party
before
they
were
ushered
into
the
library
and
the
sight
of
the
five
solemn
faces
there
assembled
chilled
her
into
silence
her
father
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
mutely
signed
to
the
ladies
to
take
the
two
vacant
chairs
one
on
each
side
of
him
his
three
sons
and
balbus
completed
the
party
writing
materials
had
been
arranged
round
the
table
after
the
fashion
of
a
ghostly
banquet
the
butler
had
evidently
bestowed
much
thought
on
the
grim
device
sheets
of
quarto
paper
each
flanked
by
a
pen
on
one
side
and
a
pencil
on
the
other
represented
the
plates
penwipers
did
duty
for
rolls
of
bread
while
stood
in
the
places
usually
occupied
by
the
de
was
a
large
green
baize
bag
which
gave
forth
as
the
old
man
restlessly
lifted
it
from
side
to
side
a
charming
jingle
as
of
innumerable
golden
guineas
sister
daughter
sons
and
balbus
the
old
man
began
so
nervously
that
balbus
put
in
a
gentle
hear
hear
while
hugh
drummed
on
the
table
with
his
fists
this
disconcerted
the
unpractised
orator
sister
he
began
again
then
paused
a
moment
moved
the
bag
to
the
other
side
and
went
on
with
a
rush
i
mean
this
being
a
critical
occasion
more
or
less
being
the
year
when
one
of
my
sons
comes
of
age
he
paused
again
in
some
confusion
having
evidently
got
into
the
middle
of
his
speech
sooner
than
he
intended
but
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
hear
hear
cried
balbus
quite
so
said
the
old
gentleman
recovering
his
a
little
when
first
i
began
this
annual
custom
my
friend
balbus
will
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
hugh
whispered
with
a
strap
but
nobody
heard
him
except
lambert
who
only
frowned
and
shook
his
head
at
him
this
annual
custom
of
giving
each
of
my
sons
as
many
guineas
as
would
represent
his
age
it
was
a
critical
time
so
balbus
informed
me
as
the
ages
of
two
of
you
were
together
equal
to
that
of
the
third
so
on
that
occasion
i
made
a
speech
he
paused
so
long
that
balbus
thought
it
well
to
come
to
the
rescue
with
the
words
it
was
a
most
but
the
old
man
checked
him
with
a
warning
look
yes
made
a
speech
he
repeated
a
few
years
after
that
balbus
pointed
out
i
say
pointed
out
hear
hear
cried
balbus
quite
so
said
the
grateful
old
man
that
it
was
critical
occasion
the
ages
of
two
of
you
were
together
that
of
the
third
so
i
made
another
speech
another
speech
and
now
again
it
a
critical
occasion
so
balbus
says
and
i
am
making
here
mad
mathesis
pointedly
referred
to
her
watch
all
the
haste
i
can
the
old
man
cried
with
wonderful
presence
of
mind
indeed
sister
i
coming
to
the
point
now
the
number
of
years
that
have
passed
since
that
first
occasion
is
just
of
the
number
of
guineas
i
then
gave
you
now
my
boys
calculate
your
ages
from
the
and
you
shall
have
the
money
but
we
our
ages
cried
hugh
silence
sir
thundered
the
old
man
rising
to
his
full
height
he
was
exactly
five
in
his
indignation
i
say
you
must
use
the
only
you
must
even
assume
it
is
that
comes
of
age
he
clutched
the
bag
as
he
spoke
and
with
tottering
steps
it
was
about
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
carry
it
he
left
the
room
and
shall
have
a
similar
the
old
lady
whispered
to
her
niece
when
you
calculated
that
percentage
and
she
followed
her
brother
nothing
could
exceed
the
solemnity
with
which
the
old
couple
had
risen
from
the
table
and
yet
was
it
was
it
a
with
which
the
father
turned
away
from
his
unhappy
sons
could
it
be
could
it
be
a
with
which
the
aunt
abandoned
her
despairing
niece
and
were
those
were
those
sounds
of
suppressed
which
floated
into
the
room
just
before
balbus
who
had
followed
them
out
closed
the
door
surely
not
and
yet
the
butler
told
the
cook
but
no
that
was
merely
idle
gossip
and
i
will
not
repeat
it
the
shades
of
evening
granted
their
unuttered
petition
and
closed
not
them
for
the
butler
brought
in
the
lamp
the
same
obliging
shades
left
them
a
lonely
bark
the
wail
of
a
dog
in
the
baying
the
moon
for
awhile
but
neither
morn
alas
nor
any
other
epoch
seemed
likely
to
restore
them
to
that
peace
of
mind
which
had
once
been
theirs
ere
ever
these
problems
had
swooped
upon
them
and
crushed
them
with
a
load
of
unfathomable
mystery
it
hardly
fair
muttered
hugh
to
give
us
such
a
jumble
as
this
to
work
out
fair
clara
echoed
bitterly
well
and
to
all
my
readers
i
can
but
repeat
the
last

two
travellers
spend
from

in
walking
along
a
level
road
up
a
hill
and
home
again
their
pace
on
the
level
being
miles
an
hour
up
hill
and
down
hill
find
distance
walked
also
within
half
an
hour
time
of
reaching
top
of
hill
miles
a
level
mile
takes
of
an
hour
up
hill
down
hill
hence
to
go
and
return
over
the
same
mile
whether
on
the
level
or
on
the
takes
an
hour
hence
in
hours
they
went
miles
out
and
back
if
the
miles
out
had
been
nearly
all
level
they
would
have
taken
a
little
over
hours
if
nearly
all
up
hill
a
little
under
hence
hours
must
be
within
an
hour
of
the
time
taken
in
reaching
the
peak
thus
as
they
started
at
they
got
there
within
an
hour
of
past
answers
have
come
in
of
these
are
right
partially
right
and
wrong
the
give
the
correctly
but
they
have
failed
to
grasp
the
fact
that
the
top
of
the
hill
might
have
been
reached
at
moment
between
and
the
two
wrong
answers
are
from
gerty
vernon
and
a
nihilist
the
former
makes
the
distance
miles
while
her
revolutionary
companion
puts
it
at
gerty
vernon
says
they
had
to
go
miles
along
the
plain
and
got
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
they
have
done
so
i
grant
but
you
have
no
ground
for
saying
they
so
it
was
miles
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
they
reached
that
at
before
here
you
go
wrong
in
your
arithmetic
and
i
must
however
reluctantly
bid
you
farewell
miles
at
miles
an
hour
would
require
hours
a
nihilist
says
let
denote
the
whole
number
of
miles
the
number
of
hours
to
therefore
number
of
miles
to
and
number
of
miles
on
the
other
side
you
bewilder
me
the
other
side
of
of
the
hill
you
say
but
then
how
did
they
get
home
again
however
to
accommodate
your
views
we
will
build
a
new
hostelry
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
and
also
assume
what
i
grant
you
is
though
it
is
not
true
that
there
was
no
level
road
at
all
even
then
you
go
wrong
you
say
i
ii
i
grant
you
i
but
i
deny
ii
it
rests
on
the
assumption
that
to
go
of
the
time
at
miles
an
hour
and
the
rest
at
miles
an
hour
comes
to
the
same
result
as
going
the
time
at
miles
an
hour
but
this
would
only
be
true
if
the
were
an
exact
if
they
went
up
hill
for
hours
and
down
hill
for
the
other
which
they
certainly
did
do
the
sixteen
who
are
partially
right

and

do
not
attempt
the
second
part
at
all
and
give
no
working
the
rest
make
particular
assumptions
such
as
that
there
was
no
level
road
that
there
were
miles
of
level
road
and
so
on
all
leading
to
times
being
fixed
for
reaching
the
the
most
curious
assumption
is
that
of
agnes
bailey
who
says
let
number
of
hours
occupied
in
ascent
then
hours
occupied
in
descent
and
hours
occupied
on
the
level
i
suppose
you
were
thinking
of
the
relative
up
hill
and
on
the
level
which
we
might
express
by
saying
that
if
they
went
x
miles
up
hill
in
a
certain
time
they
would
go
miles
on
the
level
the
same
you
have
in
fact
assumed
that
they
took
same
on
the
level
that
they
took
in
ascending
the
hill
fifee
assumes
that
when
the
aged
knight
said
they
had
gone
four
miles
in
the
hour
on
the
level
he
meant
that
four
miles
was
the
gone
not
merely
the
rate
this
would
have
been
if
fifee
will
excuse
the
slang
expression
a
sell
to
the
dignity
of
the
hero
and
now
descend
ye
classic
nine
who
have
solved
the
whole
problem
and
let
me
sing
your
praises
your
names
are

last
two

count
as

as
they
send
a
joint
answer
rose
and
simple
susan
and
do
not
actually
state
that
the
was
reached
some
time
between
and
but
as
they
have
clearly
grasped
the
fact
that
a
mile
ascended
and
descended
took
the
same
time
as
two
level
miles
i
mark
them
as
right
a
marlborough
boy
and
putney
walker
deserve
honourable
mention
for
their
algebraical
solutions
being
the
only
two
who
have
perceived
that
the
question
leads
to
indeterminate
brings
a
charge
of
untruthfulness
against
the
aged
knight
a
serious
charge
for
he
was
the
very
pink
of
chivalry

says
according
to
the
data
given

time

the
summit

no
clue
to
the
total
distance
it
does
not
enable
us
to
state
precisely

an
inch
how
much

and
how
much

there
was

it
matters

we
reached
that
summit

our

in
the

we
clambered
up

mortal

breath

for

said
the

twelve
miles
out

twelve
miles
in

we
reached

six
and
seven
of

minutes

had

of

she

two
travellers
starting
at
the
same
time
went
opposite
ways
round
a
circular
railway
trains
start
each
way
every
minutes
the
easterly
ones
going
round
in
hours
the
westerly
in
how
many
trains
did
each
meet
on
the
way
not
counting
trains
met
at
the
terminus
itself
they
went
round
as
before
each
traveller
counting
as
the
train
containing
the
other
traveller
how
many
did
each
meet
the
easterly
traveller
met
the
other
the
trains
one
way
took
minutes
the
other
way
let
us
take
the
and
divide
the
railway
into
units
then
one
set
of
trains
went
at
the
rate
of
units
a
minute
and
at
intervals
of
units
the
other
at
the
rate
of
units
a
minute
and
at
intervals
of
units
an
easterly
train
starting
has
units
between
it
and
the
first
train
it
will
meet
it
does
of
this
while
the
other
does
and
thus
meets
it
at
the
end
of
units
and
so
all
the
way
round
a
westerly
train
starting
has
units
between
it
and
the
first
train
it
will
meet
it
does
of
this
while
the
other
does
and
thus
meets
it
at
the
end
of
units
and
so
all
the
way
round
hence
if
the
railway
be
divided
by
posts
into
parts
each
containing
units
trains
meet
at
every
post
and
in
each
traveller
passes
posts
in
going
round
and
so
meets
trains
but
in
the
easterly
traveller
only
begins
to
count
after
traversing
of
the
journey
on
reaching
the
post
and
so
counts
posts
similarly
the
other
counts
they
meet
at
the
end
of
of
hours
or
of

answers

of
the

for
which
the

are
wrong

right
except
that
they
cherish
the
delusion
that
it
was
who
travelled
in
the
easterly

a
point
which
the
data
do
not
enable
us
to
settle
and
wholly
right
the
wrong
answers
are
from
financier
kate
y
thistledown
and
an
unsigned
one
rightly
says
that
the
easterly
traveller
met
all
trains
which
started
during
the
hours
of
her
trip
as
well
as
all
which
started
during
the
previous
hours
all
which
started
at
the
commencements
of
periods
of
minutes
each
and
she
is
right
in
striking
out
the
one
she
met
at
the
moment
of
starting
but
wrong
in
striking
out
the
train
for
she
did
not
meet
this
at
the
terminus
but
minutes
before
she
got
there
she
makes
the
same
mistake
in
financier
thinks
that
any
train
met
for
the
second
time
is
not
to
be
counted
finds
by
a
process
which
is
not
stated
that
the
travellers
met
at
the
end
of
minutes
and
seconds
kate
thinks
the
trains
which
are
met
on
starting
and
on
arriving
are
to
be
counted
even
when
met
elsewhere
y
tries
a
rather
complex
algebraical
solution
and
succeeds
in
finding
the
time
of
meeting
correctly
all
else
is
wrong
seems
to
think
that
in
the
easterly
train
for
hours
and
says
that
in
the
travellers
met
at
the
end
of
minutes
seconds
thistledown
nobly
confesses
to
having
tried
no
calculation
but
merely
having
drawn
a
picture
of
the
railway
and
counted
the
trains

counts
wrong
in
she

the

we
have

from

only
we
can
not

certain
of

may

we

that
we
can
by

eliminate
of
the

from
the

whose

reduce

more

either
to

to

the

may

be
solved
by
combining
the

so
as
to

this
is
merely
a

as
it
fail
even
when
the

this

gives

says
therefore

then
follow
the
amounts
of
the
unknown
bills
with
no
further
hint
as
to
how

got

piece
of
incorrect
working

the
horrid

and
shudder
she
takes
call
it
as
the
cost
of
a
sandwich
and
concludes
rightly
enough
that
a
biscuit
will
cost
she
then
subtracts
the
second
equation
from
the
first
and
deduces
by
making
two
mistakes
in
this
line
she
brings
out
try
it
again
oh
vis
inertiæ
away
with
inertiæ
infuse
a
little
more
vis
and
you
will
bring
out
the
correct
though
uninteresting
result
this
will
show
you
that
it
is
hopeless
to
try
to
coax
any
one
of
these
unknowns
to
reveal
its
value
the
other
competitor
who
is

throughout
is
either
or
but
whether
he
be
a
juvenile
or
a
true
mathematician
confused
he
makes
the
answers

he
assumes
with
too
much
confidence
that
biscuits
were
each
and
that
clara
paid
for
though
she
only
ate
we
will
now
consider
the
whose
working
is
wrong
though
the
answer
is
right
and
not
to
measure
their
demerits
too
exactly
i
will
take
them
in
alphabetical
order
anita
finds
rightly
that
sandwich
and
biscuits
cost
and
proceeds
therefore
sandwich
biscuits
lemonade
dinah
mite
begins
like
anita
and
thence
proves
rightly
that
a
biscuit
costs
less
than
a
whence
she
concludes
wrongly
that
it
cost
is
so
beautifully
resigned
to
the
certainty
of
a
verdict
of
guilty
that
i
have
hardly
the
heart
to
utter
the
word
without
adding
a
recommended
to
mercy
owing
to
extenuating
circumstances
but
really
you
know
where
the
extenuating
circumstances
she
begins
by
assuming
that
lemonade
is
a
glass
and
sandwiches
each
making
with
the
given
equations
conditions
to
be
fulfilled
by
miserable
unknowns
and
having
naturally
developed
this
into
a
contradiction
she
then
tries
and
with
a
similar
result
process
might
have
been
carried
on
through
the
whole
of
the
tertiary
period
without
gratifying
one
single
megatherium
she
then
by
a
happy
thought
tries
biscuits
and
so
obtains
a
consistent
result
this
may
be
a
good
solution

the
problem
as

conundrum

it
is

the

costs

there
not
a

glow

in
taming
such
a

ladies

the
fraction
now
before
you
is
one
that
for
years
defied
all
efforts

nature
it
was
in
a
word
hopelessly
vulgar
treating
it
as
a
circulating
decimal
the
treadmill
of

only
made

reduced

again
by
the
process
a
hopeless
mystery
deduces
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
i
give
it
up
says
it
is
immaterial
to
the
answer
why
in
what
proportion
is
divided
between
the
sandwich
and
the
biscuits
so
she
assumes
stanza
is
one
of
a
very
irregular
metre
at
first
she
like
janet
identifies
sandwiches
with
biscuits
she
then
tries
two
assumptions
and
and
naturally
ends
in
contradictions
then
she
returns
to
the
first
assumption
and
finds
the
unknowns
separately
est
stiletto
identifies
sandwiches
and
biscuits
as
articles
is
the
word
ever
used
by
confectioners
i
fancied
what
is
the
next
article
was
limited
to
linendrapers
two
sisters
first
assume
that
biscuits
are
a
penny
and
then
that
they
are
a
penny
adding
that
the
answer
will
of
course
be
the
same
in
both
cases
it
is
a
dreamy
remark
making
one
feel
something
like
macbeth
grasping
at
the
spectral
dagger
is
this
a
statement
that
i
see
before
me
if
you
were
to
say
we
both
walked
the
same
way
this
morning
and
were
to
say
of
you
walked
the
same
way
but
the
other
did
which
of
the
three
would
be
the
most
hopelessly
confused
turtle
pyate
what
a
turtle
pyate
please
and
old
crow
who
send
a
joint
answer
and
adopt
the
same
method
gets
the
equation
and
then
says
this
sum
must
be
apportioned
in
one
of
the
three
following
ways
it
be
i
grant
you
but
do
you
say
must
i
fear
it
is
for
to
be
y
the
other
two
conspirators
are
less
positive
they
say
it
can
be
so
divided
but
they
add
either
of
the
three
prices
being
right
this
is
bad
grammar
and
bad
arithmetic
at
once
oh
mysterious
birds
of
those
who
win
honours
the
shetland
snark
must
have
the
class
all
to
himself
he
has
only
answered
half
the
question
viz
the
amount
of
clara
luncheon
the
two
little
old
ladies
he
pitilessly
leaves
in
the
midst
of
their
difficulty
i
beg
to
assure
him
with
thanks
for
his
friendly
remarks
that
and
subscriptions
are
things
unknown
in
that
most
economical
of
clubs
the
the
authors
of
the
accidental
solutions
differ
only
in
the
number
of
steps
they
have
taken
between
the
and
the
answers
in
order
to
do
them
full
justice
i
have
arranged
the
class
in
sections
according
to
the
number
of
steps
the
two
kings
are
fearfully
deliberate
i
suppose
walking
quick
or
taking
short
cuts
is
inconsistent
with
kingly
dignity
but
really
in
reading
solution
one
almost
fancied
he
was
marking
time
and
making
no
advance
at
all
the
other
king
will
i
hope
pardon
me
for
having
altered
coal
into
cole
king
coilus
or
coil
seems
to
have
reigned
soon
after
arthur
time
henry
of
huntingdon
identifies
him
with
the
king
coël
who
first
built
walls
round
colchester
which
was
named
after
him
in
the
chronicle
of
robert
of
gloucester

men
of

balbus
lays
it
down
as
a
general
principle
that
in
order
to
ascertain
the
cost
of
any
one
luncheon
it
must
come
to
the
same
amount
upon
two
different
assumptions
should
not
it
be
we
otherwise
the
is
represented
as
wishing
to
ascertain
its
own
cost
he
then
makes
two
assumptions
one
that
sandwiches
cost
nothing
the
other
that
biscuits
cost
nothing
either
arrangement
would
lead
to
the
shop
being
inconveniently
crowded
and
brings
out
the
unknown
luncheons
as
and
on
each
assumption
he
then
concludes
that
this
agreement
of
results
shows
that
the
answers
are
correct
now
i
propose
to
disprove
his
general
law
by
simply
giving
instance
of
its
failing
one
instance
is
quite
enough
in
logical
language
in
order
to
disprove
a
universal
affirmative
it
is
enough
to
prove
its
contradictory
which
is
a
particular
negative
i
must
pause
for
a
digression
on
logic
and
especially
on
ladies
logic
the
universal
affirmative
everybody
says
he
a
duck
is
crushed
instantly
by
proving
the
particular
negative
peter
says
he
a
goose
which
is
equivalent
to
peter
does
say
he
a
duck
and
the
universal
negative
nobody
calls
on
her
is
well
met
by
the
particular
affirmative
called
yesterday
in
short
either
of
two
contradictories
disproves
the
other
and
the
moral
is
that
since
a
particular
proposition
is
much
more
easily
proved
than
a
universal
one
it
is
the
wisest
course
in
arguing
with
a
lady
to
limit
one
assertions
to
particulars
and
leave
to
prove
the
universal
contradictory
if
she
can
you
will
thus
generally
secure
a
victory
a
victory
is
not
to
be
hoped
for
since
she
can
always
fall
back
upon
the
crushing
remark
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
move
for
which
man
has
not
yet
discovered
any
satisfactory
answer
now
let
us
return
to
balbus
here
is
my
particular
negative
on
which
to
test
his
rule
suppose
the
two
recorded
luncheons
to
have
been
buns
one
and
a
bottle
of
zoëdone
total
and
one
bun
a
and
a
bottle
of
zoëdone
total
and
suppose
clara
unknown
luncheon
to
have
been
buns
one
one
and
bottles
of
zoëdone
while
the
two
little
sisters
had
been
indulging
in
buns
and
bottles
of
zoëdone
poor
souls
how
thirsty
they
must
have
been
if
balbus
will
kindly
try
this
by
his
principle
of
two
assumptions
first
assuming
that
a
bun
is
and
a
and
then
that
a
bun
is
and
a
he
will
bring
out
the
other
two
luncheons
on
each
assumption
as
and
respectively
which
harmony
of
results
he
will
say
shows
that
the
answers
are
correct
and
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
buns
were
each
the
the
and
the
zoëdone
a
bottle
so
that
clara
third
luncheon
had
cost
and
her
thirsty
friends
had
spent
another
remark
of
balbus
i
will
quote
and
discuss
for
i
think
that
it
also
may
yield
a
moral
for
some
of
my
readers
he
says
it
is
the
same
thing
in
substance
whether
in
solving
this
problem
we
use
words
and
call
it
arithmetic
or
use
letters
and
signs
and
call
it
algebra
now
this
does
not
appear
to
me
a
correct
description
of
the
two
methods
the
arithmetical
method
is
that
of
synthesis
only
it
goes
from
one
known
fact
to
another
till
it
reaches
its
goal
whereas
the
algebraical
method
is
that
of
analysis
it
begins
with
the
goal
symbolically
represented
and
so
goes
backwards
dragging
its
veiled
victim
with
it
till
it
has
reached
the
full
daylight
of
known
facts
in
which
it
can
tear
off
the
veil
and
say
i
know
you
take
an
illustration
your
house
has
been
broken
into
and
robbed
and
you
appeal
to
the
policeman
who
was
on
duty
that
night
well
mum
i
did
see
a
chap
getting
out
over
your
but
i
was
a
good
bit
off
so
i
did
chase
him
like
i
just
cut
down
the
short
way
to
the
chequers
and
who
should
i
meet
but
bill
sykes
coming
full
split
round
the
corner
so
i
just
ups
and
says
lad
you
wanted
that
all
i
says
and
he
says
go
along
quiet
bobby
he
says
the
darbies
he
says
there
your
policeman
now
try
the
other
method
i
seed
somebody
a
running
but
he
was
well
gone
or
ever
got
nigh
the
place
so
i
just
took
a
look
round
in
the
garden
and
i
noticed
the
where
the
chap
had
come
right
across
your
they
was
good
big
and
i
noticed
as
the
left
foot
went
down
at
the
heel
ever
so
much
deeper
than
the
other
and
i
says
to
myself
chap
been
a
big
hulking
chap
and
he
goes
lame
on
his
left
foot
and
i
rubs
my
hand
on
the
wall
where
he
got
over
and
there
was
soot
on
it
and
no
mistake
so
i
says
to
myself
where
can
i
light
on
a
big
man
in
the
line
what
lame
of
one
foot
and
i
flashes
up
permiscuous
and
i
says
bill
sykes
says
i
there
is
your
policeman
a
higher
intellectual
type
to
my
thinking
than
the
other
little
jack
solution
calls
for
a
word
of
praise
as
he
has
written
out
what
really
is
an
algebraical
proof
without
representing
any
of
his
facts
as
equations
if
it
is
all
his
own
he
will
make
a
good
algebraist
in
the
time
to
come

theseus
answers
to

i
have
received
several
letters
on
the
subjects
of
knots
ii
and
which
lead
me
to
think
some
further
explanation
desirable
in
knot
i
had
intended
the
numbering
of
the
houses
to
begin
at
one
corner
of
the
square
and
this
was
assumed
by
most
if
not
all
of
the
competitors
trojanus
however
says
assuming
in
default
of
any
information
that
the
street
enters
the
square
in
the
middle
of
each
side
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
numbering
begins
at
a
street
but
surely
the
other
is
the
more
natural
assumption
in
knot
the
first
problem
was
of
course
a
mere
de
whose
presence
i
thought
excusable
in
a
series
of
problems
whose
aim
is
to
entertain
rather
than
to
instruct
but
it
has
not
escaped
the
contemptuous
criticisms
of
two
of
my
correspondents
who
seem
to
think
that
apollo
is
in
duty
bound
to
keep
his
bow
always
on
the
stretch
neither
of
them
has
guessed
it
and
this
is
true
human
nature
only
the
other
day
the
of
september
to
be
quite
exact
i
met
my
old
friend
brown
and
gave
him
a
riddle
i
had
just
heard
with
one
great
effort
of
his
colossal
mind
brown
guessed
it
right
said
i
ah
said
he
it
very
neat
very
neat
and
it
is
an
answer
that
would
occur
to
everybody
very
neat
indeed
a
few
yards
further
on
i
fell
in
with
smith
and
to
him
i
propounded
the
same
riddle
he
frowned
over
it
for
a
minute
and
then
gave
it
up
meekly
i
faltered
out
the
answer
a
poor
thing
sir
smith
growled
as
he
turned
away
a
very
poor
thing
i
wonder
you
care
to
repeat
such
rubbish
yet
smith
mind
is
if
possible
even
more
colossal
than
brown
the
second
problem
of
knot
vi
is
an
example
in
ordinary
double
rule
of
three
whose
essential
feature
is
that
the
result
depends
on
the
variation
of
several
elements
which
are
so
related
to
it
that
if
all
but
one
be
constant
it
varies
as
that
one
hence
if
none
be
constant
it
varies
as
their
product
thus
for
example
the
cubical
contents
of
a
rectangular
tank
vary
as
its
length
if
breadth
and
depth
be
constant
and
so
on
hence
if
none
be
constant
it
varies
as
the
product
of
the
length
breadth
and
depth
when
the
result
is
not
thus
connected
with
the
varying
elements
the
problem
ceases
to
be
double
rule
of
three
and
often
becomes
one
of
great
complexity
to
illustrate
this
let
us
take
two
candidates
for
a
prize
and
who
are
to
compete
in
french
german
and
italian
let
it
be
laid
down
that
the
result
is
to
depend
on
their
knowledge
of
each
subject
so
that
whether
their
marks
for
french
be
or
the
result
will
be
the
same
and
let
it
also
be
laid
down
that
if
they
get
equal
marks
on
papers
the
final
marks
are
to
have
the
same
ratio
as
those
of
the
paper
this
is
a
case
of
ordinary
double
rule
of
three
we
multiply
marks
together
and
do
the
same
for
note
that
if
gets
a
single
his
final
mark
is
even
if
he
gets
full
marks
for
papers
while
gets
only
one
mark
for
each
paper
this
of
course
would
be
very
unfair
on
though
a
correct
solution
under
the
given
conditions
the
result
is
to
depend
as
before
on
knowledge
but
french
is
to
have
twice
as
much
weight
as
german
or
italian
this
is
an
unusual
form
of
question
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
the
resulting
ratio
is
to
be
nearer
to
the
french
ratio
than
if
we
multiplied
as
in
and
so
much
nearer
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
use
the
other
multipliers
to
produce
the
same
result
as
in
if
the
french
ratio
were
and
the
others
so
that
the
ultimate
ratio
by
method
would
be
i
should
multiply
instead
by
giving
the
result
which
is
nearer
to
than
if
he
had
used
method
the
result
is
to
depend
on
amount
of
knowledge
of
the
subjects
collectively
here
we
have
to
ask
two
questions
what
is
to
be
the
unit
standard
to
measure
by
in
each
subject
are
these
units
to
be
of
equal
or
unequal
value
the
usual
unit
is
the
knowledge
shown
by
answering
the
whole
paper
correctly
calling
this
all
lower
amounts
are
represented
by
numbers
between
and
then
if
these
units
are
to
be
of
equal
value
we
simply
add
marks
together
and
do
the
same
for
the
conditions
are
the
same
as
but
french
is
to
have
double
weight
here
we
simply
double
the
french
marks
and
add
as
before
french
is
to
have
such
weight
that
if
other
marks
be
equal
the
ultimate
ratio
is
to
be
that
of
the
french
paper
so
that
a
in
this
would
swamp
the
candidate
but
the
other
two
subjects
are
only
to
affect
the
result
collectively
by
the
amount
of
knowledge
shown
the
two
being
reckoned
of
equal
value
here
i
should
add
german
and
italian
marks
together
and
multiply
by
his
french
mark
but
i
need
not
go
on
the
problem
may
evidently
be
set
with
many
varying
conditions
each
requiring
its
own
method
of
solution
the
problem
in
knot
vi
was
meant
to
belong
to
variety
and
to
make
this
clear
i
inserted
the
following
passage
usually
the
competitors
differ
in
one
point
only
thus
last
year
fifi
and
gogo
made
the
same
number
of
scarves
in
the
trial
week
and
they
were
equally
light
but
fifi
were
twice
as
warm
as
gogo
and
she
was
pronounced
twice
as
good
what
i
have
said
will
suffice
i
hope
as
an
answer
to
balbus
who
holds
that
and
are
the
only
possible
varieties
of
the
problem
and
that
to
say
we
can
not
use
addition
therefore
we
must
be
intended
to
use
multiplication
is
no
more
illogical
than
from
knowledge
that
one
was
not
born
in
the
night
to
infer
that
he
was
born
in
the
daytime
and
also
to
fifee
who
says
i
think
a
little
more
consideration
will
show
you
that
our
of
the
proportional
numbers
together
for
each
candidate
instead
of
is
no
error
at
all
why
even
if
addition
been
the
right
method
to
use
not
one
of
the
writers
i
speak
from
memory
showed
any
consciousness
of
the
necessity
of
fixing
a
unit
for
each
subject
no
error
at
all
they
were
positively
steeped
in
error
one
correspondent
i
do
not
name
him
as
the
communication
is
not
quite
friendly
in
tone
writes
thus
i
wish
to
add
very
respectfully
that
i
think
it
would
be
in
better
taste
if
you
were
to
abstain
from
the
very
trenchant
expressions
which
you
are
accustomed
to
indulge
in
when
criticising
the
answer
that
such
a
tone
must
not
be
be
not
agreeable
to
the
persons
concerned
who
have
made
mistakes
may
possibly
have
no
great
weight
with
you
but
i
hope
you
will
feel
that

he
will
find
the
distinction
for
which
i
plead
far
better
drawn
out
than
i
could

to
do
in

words

that

how

to
his

must
entirely
demur
i
hold
that

the

the

where
they

the
other
omnibus
minutes
after
they
left
but
wrongly
concludes
that
going
times
as
fast
it
would
overtake
them
in
another
minute
the
travellers
are
ahead
of
the
omnibus
and
must
walk
of
this
distance
farther
before
the
omnibus
overtakes
them
which
will
be
of
the

traversed

this

more
nolens
volens
tries
it
by

he
rightly
states
that
when
the

leaves
the
gate
the
travellers
are
of

and
that
it
will
take
the
omnibus
minutes
to
traverse
this
distance
during
which
time
the
travellers
he
tells
us
go
of
this
should
be
the

being
now

he
concludes
that
the
work
remaining
to
be
done
is
for
the

to
go

goes

is

the

would
not

which
agrees
with

five
answers
have
been

none
of
which
explains
the
difficulty
arising
from
the
fact
that
a
floating
body
is
the
same
weight
as
the
displaced
fluid
hecla
says
that
only
that
portion
of
the
smaller
bucket
which
descends
below
the
original
level
of
the
water
can
be
properly
said
to
be
immersed
and
only
an
equal
bulk
of
water
is
displaced
hence
according
to
hecla
a
solid
whose
weight
was
equal
to
that
of
an
equal
bulk
of

would
not
float
till
the
whole
of
it
was

as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
float
as
soon
as
it
was
all
under

magpie
says
the
fallacy
is
the
assumption
that
one
body
can
displace
another
from
a
place
where
it
is
and
that
lardner
assertion
is
incorrect
except
when
the
containing
vessel
was
originally
full
to
the
brim
but
the
question
of
floating
depends
on
the
present
state
of
things
not
on

the

view
as

assume
that
displaced

raised
above

how
it
comes
to

that
the
water
so
raised
is
less
in

the
immersed
portion
of

thus

themselves

one
of

merely
asserts
that
the
first

was
years

that
the
ages
were
then

and
that
on
the
second
occasion
they
were

to
withhold

asserts
that

merely
scratching
up

pecking
about

the
way
to
solve
a
problem
oh
venerable

close
after

with

old

calmly
assumes
to

that

a

comes
of

that
it
is

dinah
mite
ascertains
rightly
the
relationship
between
the
three
ages
at
first
but
then
one
of
them
to
be
thus
making
the
rest
of
her
solution
tentative
does
the
algebra
all
right
up
to
the
conclusion
that
the
present
ages
are
and
it
then
assumes
without
giving
any
reason
that
of
the
more
honourable
delta
attempts
a
novelty
to
discover
son
comes
of
age
by
elimination
it
assumes
successively
that
it
is
the
middle
one
and
that
it
is
the
youngest
and
in
each
case
it
brings
out
an
absurdity
still
as
the
proof
contains
the
following
bit
of
algebra
therefore
sevenths
of
i
trust
it
will
admit
that
its
proof
is
not
conclusive
the
rest
of
its
work
is
good
magpie
betrays
the
deplorable
tendency
of
her
tribe
to
appropriate
any
stray
conclusion
she
comes
across
without
having
any
logical
right
to
it
assuming
as
the
ages
at
first
and
as
the
number
of
the
years
that
have
elapsed
since
then
she
finds
rightly
the
equations
she
then
says
supposing
that
then
and
therefore
for
four
numbers
are
wanted
which
shall
be
to
each
other
as
it
is
in
the
therefore
that
i
detect
the
unconscientiousness
of
this
bird
the
conclusion
true
but
this
is
only
because
the
equations
are
homogeneous
having
one
unknown
in
each
term
a
fact
which
i
strongly
suspect
had
not
been
grasped
i
beg
pardon
clawed
by
her
were
i
to
lay
this
little
pitfall
supposing
then
and
for
three
numbers
are
wanted
which
shall
be
to
one
another
as
would
you
not
flutter
down
into
it
oh
magpie
as
amiably
as
a
dove
simple
susan
is
anything
but
simple
to
after
ascertaining
that
the
ages
at
first
are
as
she
says
then
as
of
their
sum
added
to
one
of
them
the
sum
can
not
exceed
and
consequently
the
highest
can
not
exceed
i
suppose
her
mental
argument
is
something
like
this
of
sum
one
age
therefore
sum
halves
of
one
age
and
a
half
but
halves
of
one
age
can
not
be
less
than
here
i
perceive
that
simple
susan
would
on
no
account
present
a
guinea
to
a
baby
hence
the
sum
can
not
exceed
this
is
ingenious
but
her
proof
after
that
is
as
she
candidly
admits
clumsy
and
roundabout
she
finds
that
there
are
possible
sets
of
ages
and
eliminates
four
of
them
suppose
that
instead
of
there
had
been
million
possible
sets
would
simple
susan
have
courageously
ordered
in
the
necessary
gallon
of
ink
and
ream
of
paper
the
solution
sent
in
by
is
like
that
of
simple
susan
partly
tentative
and
so
does
not
rise
higher
than
being
clumsily
right
among
those
who
have
earned
the
highest
honours
algernon
bray
solves
the
problem
quite
correctly
but
adds
that
there
is
nothing
to
exclude
the
supposition
that
all
the
ages
were
this
would
make
the
number
of
answers
infinite
let
me
meekly
protest
that
i
intended
my
readers
to
devote
the
rest
of
their
lives
to
writing
out
answers
rix
points
out
that
if
fractional
ages
be
admissible
any
one
of
the
three
sons
might
be
the
one
come
of
age
but
she
rightly
rejects
this
supposition
on
the
ground
that
it
would
make
the
problem
indeterminate
white

is
the
only
one
who
has
detected
an
oversight
of
mine
i
had
forgotten
the
possibility
which
of
course
ought
to
be
allowed
for
that
the
son
who
came
of
age
that
need
not
have
done
so
by
that
so
that
he
be

remonstrance

that
it
was
illogical
to
assume
from

have

that
have
algernon

states
as
a
parallel

him
apples

he
eats
one
of
them
how
many
has
he
left

says
i

we
are

in
answering
i
think
so
too
there
is
no
must
here
and
the
are
evidently
meant
to
fix
the
answer
but
if
the
question
were
set
me
how
many
he
have
left
i
should
understand
the
to

his

gave
him

given
him
more
