entitled
the
gilded
age
years
ago
and
as
beriah
sellers
in
the
subsequent
editions
of
the
same
book
and
finally
as
mulberry
sellers
in
the
drama
played
afterward
by
john
raymond
the
name
was
changed
from
eschol
to
beriah
to
accommodate
an
eschol
sellers
who
rose
up
out
of
the
vasty
deeps
of
uncharted
space
and
preferred
his
request
backed
by
threat
of

beriah

mulberry
was
substituted
in

hope
that

be
tired
by

the
weather
in
this
book
no
weather
will
be
found
in
this
book
this
is
an
attempt
to
pull
a
book
through
without
weather
it
being
the
first
attempt
of
the
kind
in
fictitious
literature
it
may
prove
a
failure
but
it
seemed
worth
the
while
of
some
person
to
try
it
and
the
author
was
in
just
the
mood
many
a
reader
who
wanted
to
read
a
tale
through
was
not
able
to
do
it
because
of
delays
on
account
of
the
weather
nothing
breaks
up
an
author
progress
like
having
to
stop
every
few
pages
to
the
weather
thus
it
is
plain
that
persistent
intrusions
of
weather
are
bad
for
both
reader
and
author
of
course
weather
is
necessary
to
a
narrative
of
human
experience
that
is
conceded
but
it
ought
to
be
put
where
it
will
not
be
in
the
way
where
it
will
not
interrupt
the
flow
of
the
narrative
and
it
ought
to
be
the
ablest
weather
that
can
be
had
not
ignorant
amateur
weather
weather
is
a
literary
specialty
and
no
untrained
hand
can
turn
out
a
good
article
of
it
the
present
author
can
do
only
a
few
trifling
ordinary
kinds
of
weather
and
he
can
not
do
those
very
good
so
it
has
seemed
wisest
to
borrow
such
weather
as
is
necessary
for
the
book
from
qualified
and
recognized
experts
giving
credit
of
course
this
weather
will
be
found
over
in
the
back
part
of
the
book
out
of
the
way

appendix
the
reader
is
requested
to
turn
over
and
help
himself
from
time
to
time
as
he
goes
along
chapter
i
it
is
a
matchless
morning
in
rural
england
on
a
fair
hill
we
see
a
majestic
pile
the
ivied
walls
and
towers
of
cholmondeley
castle
huge
relic
and
witness
of
the
baronial
grandeurs
of
the
middle
ages
this
is
one
of
the
seats
of
the
earl
of
rossmore
who
possesses
thousand
acres
of
english
land
owns
a
parish
in
london
with
two
thousand
houses
on
its
and
struggles
comfortably
along
on
an
income
of
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
father
and
founder
of
this
proud
old
line
was
william
the
conqueror
his
very
self
the
mother
of
it
was
not
inventoried
in
history
by
name
she
being
merely
a
random
episode
and
inconsequential
like
the
tanner
daughter
of
falaise
in
a
breakfast
room
of
the
castle
on
this
breezy
fine
morning
there
are
two
persons
and
the
cooling
remains
of
a
deserted
meal
one
of
these
persons
is
the
old
lord
tall
erect
a
man
who
shows
character
in
every
feature
attitude
and
movement
and
carries
his
seventy
years
as
easily
as
most
men
carry
fifty
the
other
person
is
his
only
son
and
heir
a
young
fellow
who
looks
about
but
is
nearer
thirty
candor
kindliness
honesty
sincerity
simplicity
modesty
it
is
easy
to
see
that
these
are
cardinal
traits
of
his
character
and
so
when
you
have
clothed
him
in
the
formidable
components
of
his
name
you
somehow
seem
to
be
contemplating
a
lamb
in
armor
his
name
and
style
being
the
honourable

marjoribanks

pronounced

vycount
barkly
of
chumly
castle
warrikshr
he
is
standing
by
a
great
window
in
an
attitude
suggestive
of
respectful
attention
to
what
his
father
is
saying
and
equally
respectful
dissent
from
the
positions
and
arguments
offered
the
father
walks
the
floor
as
he
talks
and
his
talk
shows
that
his
temper
is
away
up
toward
summer
heat
as
you
are
berkeley
i
am
quite
aware
that
when
you
have
once
made
up
your
mind
to
do
a
thing
which
your
ideas
of
honor
and
justice
require
you
to
do
argument
and
reason
are
for
the
time
being
wasted
upon
you
yes
and
ridicule
persuasion
supplication
and
command
as
well
to
my
mind
father
if
you
will
look
at
it
without
prejudice
without
passion
you
must
concede
that
i
am
not
doing
a
rash
thing
a
thoughtless
wilful
thing
with
nothing
substantial
behind
it
to
justify
it
i
did
not
create
the
american
claimant
to
the
earldom
of
rossmore
i
did
not
hunt
for
him
did
not
find
him
did
not
obtrude
him
upon
your
notice
he
found
himself
he
injected
himself
into
our
lives
and
has
made
mine
a
purgatory
for
ten
years
with
his
tiresome
letters
his
wordy
reasonings
his
acres
of
tedious
evidence
which
you
would
never
read
would
never
consent
to
read
yet
in
common
fairness
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
that
hearing
would
either
prove
he
was
the
rightful
earl
in
which
case
our
course
would
be
plain
or
it
would
prove
that
he
was
in
which
case
our
course
would
be
equally
plain
i
have
read
his
evidences
my
lord
i
have
conned
them
well
studied
them
patiently
and
thoroughly
the
chain
seems
to
be
complete
no
important
link
wanting
i
believe
he
is
the
rightful
and
i
a
usurper
a
nameless
pauper
a
tramp
consider
what
you
are
saying
father
if
he
is
the
rightful
earl
would
you
could
you
that
fact
being
established
consent
to
keep
his
titles
and
his
properties
from
him
a
day
an
hour
a
minute
you
are
talking
nonsense
nonsense
lurid
idiocy
now
listen
to
me
i
will
make
a
confession
if
you
wish
to
call
it
by
that
name
i
did
not
read
those
evidences
because
i
had
no
occasion
to
i
was
made
familiar
with
them
in
the
time
of
this
claimant
father
and
of
my
own
father
forty
years
ago
this
fellow
predecessors
have
kept
mine
more
or
less
familiar
with
them
for
close
upon
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
truth
is
the
rightful
heir
did
go
to
america
with
the
fairfax
heir
or
about
the
same
time
but
disappeared
somewhere
in
the
wilds
of
virginia
got
married
and
began
to
breed
savages
for
the
claimant
market
wrote
no
letters
home
was
supposed
to
be
dead
his
younger
brother
softly
took
possession
presently
the
american
did
die
and
straightway
his
eldest
product
put
in
his
claim
by
letter
letter
still
in
existence
and
died
before
the
uncle
found
time
or
maybe
inclination
to
answer
the
infant
son
of
that
eldest
product
grew
up
long
interval
you
see
and
he
took
to
writing
letters
and
furnishing
evidences
well
successor
after
successor
has
done
the
same
down
to
the
present
idiot
it
was
a
succession
of
paupers
not
one
of
them
was
ever
able
to
pay
his
passage
to
england
or
institute
suit
the
fairfaxes
kept
their
lordship
alive
and
so
they
have
never
lost
it
to
this
day
although
they
live
in
maryland
their
friend
lost
his
by
his
own
neglect
you
perceive
now
that
the
facts
in
this
case
bring
us
to
precisely
this
result
morally
the
american
tramp
is
rightful
earl
of
rossmore
legally
he
has
no
more
right
than
his
dog
there
now
are
you
satisfied
there
was
a
pause
then
the
son
glanced
at
the
crest
carved
in
the
great
oaken
mantel
and
said
with
a
regretful
note
in
his
voice
since
the
introduction
of
heraldic
symbols
the
motto
of
this
house
has
been
cuique
to
every
man
his
own
by
your
own
intrepidly
frank
confession
my
lord
it
is
become
a
sarcasm
if
simon
lathers
keep
that
exasperating
name
to
yourself
for
ten
years
it
has
pestered
my
eye
and
tortured
my
ear
till
at
last
my
very
footfalls
time
themselves
to
the
rhythm
of
simon
lathers
simon
lathers
simon
lathers
and
now
to
make
its
presence
in
my
soul
eternal
immortal
imperishable
you
have
resolved
to
to
what
is
it
you
have
resolved
to
do
to
go
to
simon
lathers
in
america
and
change
places
with
what
deliver
the
reversion
of
the
earldom
into
his
hands
that
is
my
make
this
tremendous
surrender
without
even
trying
the
fantastic
case
in
the
lords
ye
s
with
hesitation
and
some
embarrassment
by
all
that
is
amazing
i
believe
you
are
insane
my
son
see
here
have
you
been
training
with
that
ass
again
that
radical
if
you
prefer
the
term
though
the
words
are
synonymous
lord
tanzy
of
tollmache
the
son
did
not
reply
and
the
old
lord
continued
yes
you
confess
that
puppy
that
shame
to
his
birth
and
caste
who
holds
all
hereditary
lordships
and
privilege
to
be
usurpation
all
nobility
a
tinsel
sham
all
aristocratic
institutions
a
fraud
all
inequalities
in

a
legalized
crime
and
an
infamy
and
no

honest
bread
that
a

does
earn

and

just
those
opinions
yourself
i
suppose
he
added
with
a
sneer
a
faint
flush
in
the
younger
man
cheek
told
that
the
shot
had
hit
and
hurt
but
he
answered
with
dignity
i
have
i
say
it
without
shame
i
feel
none
and
now
my
reason
for
resolving
to
renounce
my
heirship
without
resistance
is
explained
i
wish
to
retire
from
what
to
me
is
a
false
existence
a
false
position
and
begin
my
life
over
again
begin
it
right
begin
it
on
the
level
of
mere
manhood
unassisted
by
factitious
aids
and
succeed
or
fail
by
pure
merit
or
the
want
of
it
i
will
go
to
america
where
all
men
are
equal
and
all
have
an
equal
chance
i
will
live
or
die
sink
or
swim
win
or
lose
as
just
a
man
that
alone
and
not
a
single
helping

or
fiction
back
of
hear
hear
the
two
men
looked
each
other
steadily
in
the
eye
a
moment
or
two
then
the
elder
one
added
musingly
after
another
silence
he
said
as
one
who
long
troubled
by
clouds

a
ray
of
sunshine
well
there
will
be
one
satisfaction
simon
lathers
will
come
here
to
enter
into
his
own

i
will
drown
him
in
the
horsepond
the
poor
devil
always
so
humble
in
his
letters
so
pitiful
so
deferential
so
steeped
in
reverence
for
our
great
line
and
so
anxious
to
placate
us
so
prayerful
for
recognition
as
a
relative
a
bearer
in
his
veins
of
our
sacred
blood
and
withal
so
poor
so
needy
so
threadbare
and
as
to
raiment
so
despised
so
laughed
at
for
his
silly
claimantship
by
the
lewd
american
scum
around
him
ah
the
vulgar
crawling
insufferable
tramp
to
read
one
of
his
cringing
nauseating
letters
well
this
to
a
splendid
flunkey
all
in
inflamed
plush
and
buttons
and
as
to
his
trunk
and
a
glinting
white
of
paste
as
to
his
head
who
stood
with
his
heels
together
and
the
upper
half
of
him
bent
forward
a
salver
in
his
hands
the
letters
my
my

took
them
and
the

among

a
most
ostentatiously
broad
mourning

since
he
was

chapter
ii
colonel
mulberry

this
was
some
days
before
he
wrote
his
letter
to
lord
rossmore
was
seated
in
his
library
which
was
also
his
and
was
also
his
picture
gallery
and
likewise
his
sometimes
he
called
it
by
one
of
these
names
sometimes
by
another
according
to
occasion
and
circumstance
he
was
constructing
what
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
a
frail
mechanical
toy
and
was
apparently
very
much
interested
in
his
work
he
was
a
man
now
but
otherwise
he
was
as
young
alert
buoyant
visionary
and
enterprising
as
ever
his
loving
old
wife
sat
near
by
contentedly
knitting
and
thinking
with
a
cat
asleep
in
her
lap
the
room
was
large
light
and
had
a
comfortable
look
in
fact
a
look
though
the
furniture
was
of
a
humble
sort
and
not
over
abundant
and
the
knickknacks
and
things
that
go
to
adorn
a
not
plenty
and
not
costly
but
there
were
natural
flowers
and
there
was
an
abstract
and
unclassifiable
something
about
the
place
which
betrayed
the
presence
in
the
house
of
somebody
with
a
happy
taste
and
an
effective
touch
even
the
deadly
chromos
on
the
walls
were
somehow
without
offence
in
fact
they
seemed
to
belong
there
and
to
add
an
attraction
to
the
room
a
fascination
anyway
for
whoever
got
his
eye
on
one
of
them
was
like
to
gaze
and
suffer
till
he
died
you
have
seen
that
kind
of
pictures
some
of
these
terrors
were
landscapes
some
libeled
the
sea
some
were
ostensible
portraits
all
were
crimes
all
the
portraits
were
recognizable
as
dead
americans
of
distinction
and
yet
through
labeling
added
by
a
daring
hand
they
were
all
doing
duty
here
as
earls
of

newest
one
had
left
the
works
as
andrew

but
was
doing
its
best
now
as
simon

lord

present
on
one
wall
was
a
cheap
old
railroad
map
of
warwickshire
this
had
been
newly
labeled
the
rossmore
on
the
opposite
wall
was
another
map
and
this
was
the
most
imposing
decoration
of
the
establishment
and
the
first
to
catch
a
stranger
attention
because
of
its
great
size
it
had
once
borne
simply
the
title
siberia
but
now
the
word
future
had
been
written
in
front
of
that
word
there
were
other
additions
in
red
ink
many
cities
with
great
populations
set
down
scattered
over
the
at
points
where
neither
cities
nor
populations
exist
one
of
these
cities

more

a
rickety
old
frame
of
considerable
size
which
had
been
painted
some
time
or
other
but
had
nearly
forgotten
it
it
was
away
out
in
the
ragged
edge
of
washington
and
had
once
been

it
had
a
neglected
yard
around
it
with
paling

that
needed
straightening
up
in
places
and
a

that
would
stay
shut

was
the
principal
one
one
learned
from
the
others
that
the
colonel
was
a
materializer
a
hypnotizer
a
dabbler
and
so
on
for
he
was
a
man
who
could
always
find
things
to
do

the
colonel
and
his
wife
were
on
their
feet
in
a
moment
and
the
next
moment
were
joyfully
wringing
the
hands
of
a
stoutish
man
whose
general
aspect
suggested
that
he
was
fifty
years
old
but
whose
hair
swore
to
a
hundred
well
well
well
washington
my
boy
it
is
good
to
look
at
you
again
sit
down
sit
down
and
make
yourself
at
home
there
now
why
you
look
perfectly
natural
aging
a
little
just
a
little
but
you
have
known
him
anywhere
would
you
polly
oh
yes
berry
he
just
like
his
pa
would
have
looked
if
he
lived
dear
dear
where
have
you
dropped
from
let
me
see
how
long
is
it
since
i
should
say
it
all
of
fifteen
years
well
well
how
time
does
get
away
with
us
yes
and
oh
the
changes
that
there
was
a
sudden
catch
of
her
voice
and
a
trembling
of
the
lip
the
men
waiting
reverently
for
her
to
get
command
of
herself
and
go
on
but
after
a
little
struggle
she
turned
away
with
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
softly
disappeared
seeing
you
made
her
think
of
the
children
poor
thing
dear
dear
they
all
dead
but
the
youngest
but
banish
care
it
no
time
for
it
now
on
with
the
dance
let
joy
be
unconfined
is
my
motto
whether
there
any
dance
to
dance
or
any
joy
to
unconfine
you
be
the
healthier
for
it
every
time
every
time
washington
it
my
experience
and
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
this
world
come
where
have
you
disappeared
to
all
these
years
and
are
you
from
there
now
or
where
are
you
from
i
do
quite
think
you
would
ever
guess
colonel
cherokee
my
land
sure
as
you
you
ca
mean
it
actually
living
out
there
well
yes
if
a
body
may
call
it
that
though
it
a
pretty
strong
term
for
and
jackass
rabbits
boiled
beans
and
depression
withered
hopes
poverty
in
all
its
varieties
louise
out
there
yes
and
the
out
there
now
yes
i
could
afford
to
bring
them
with
oh
i
see
you
had
to
come
claim
against
the
government
make
yourself
perfectly
easy
i
take
care
of
but
it
is
a
claim
against
the
no
want
to
be
postmaster
that
all
right
leave
it
to
me
i
fix
but
it
is
postmaster
you
all
astray
well
good
gracious
washington
why
do
you
come
out
and
tell
me
what
it
is
what
do
you
want
to
be
so
reserved
and
distrustful
with
an
old
friend
like
me
for
do
you
reckon
i
can
keep
a
se
there
no
secret
about
it
you
merely
do
give
me
a
chance
to
now
look
here
old
friend
i
know
the
human
race
and
i
know
that
when
a
man
comes
to
washington
i
do
care
if
it
from
heaven
let
alone
it
because
he
wants
something
and
i
know
that
as
a
rule
he
not
going
to
get
it
that
he
stay
and
try
for
another
thing
and
wo
get
that
the
same
luck
with
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
keeps
on
till
he
strikes
bottom
and
is
too
poor
and
ashamed
to
go
back
even
to
cherokee
strip
and
at
last
his
heart
breaks
and
they
take
up
a
collection
and
bury
him
there
interrupt
me
i
know
what
i
talking
about
happy
and
prosperous
in
the
far
west
was
i
you
know
that
principal
citizen
of
hawkeye
looked
up
to
by
everybody
kind
of
an
autocrat
actually
a
kind
of
an
autocrat
washington
well
nothing
would
do
but
i
must
go
minister
to
james
the
governor
and
everybody
insisting
you
know
and
so
at
last
i
consented
no
getting
out
of
it
had
to
do
it
so
here
i
came
a
day
too
late
washington
think
of
that
what
little
things
change
the
history
yes
sir
the
place
had
been
filled
well
there
i
was
you
see
i
offered
to
compromise
and
go
to
paris
the
president
was
very
sorry
and
all
that
but
that
place
you
see
did
belong
to
the
west
so
there
i
was
again
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
i
had
to
stoop
a
little
we
all
reach
the
day
some
time
or
other
when
we
got
to
do
that
washington
and
it
not
a
bad
thing
for
us
either
take
it
by
and
large
and
all
around
i
had
to
stoop
a
little
and
offer
to
take
constantinople
washington
consider
this
for
it
perfectly
true
within
a
month
i
asked
for
china
within
another
month
i
begged
for
japan
one
year
later
i
was
away
down
down
down
supplicating
with
tears
and
anguish
for
the
bottom
office
in
the
gift
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
cellars
of
the
war
department
and
by
george
i
did
get
yes
office
established
in
the
time
of
the
revolution
last
century
the
for
the
military
posts
were
supplied
from
the
capitol
they
do
it
yet
for
although
the
has
gone
out
and
the
forts
have
tumbled
down
the
decree
has
been
repealed
been
overlooked
and
forgotten
you
see
and
so
the
vacancies
where
old
ticonderoga
and
others
used
to
stand
still
get
their
six
quarts
of
a
year
just
the
washington
said
musingly
after
a
pause
how
strange
it
seems
to
start
for
minister
to
england
at
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
fail
for
flintpicker
at
three
dollars
a
week
it
human
life
washington
just
an
epitome
of
human
ambition
and
struggle
and
the
outcome
you
aim
for
the
palace
and
get
drowned
in
the
there
was
another
meditative
silence
then
washington
said
with
earnest
compassion
in
his
voice
and
so
after
coming
here
against
your
inclination
to
satisfy
your
sense
of
patriotic
duty
and
appease
a
selfish
public
clamor
you
get
absolutely
nothing
for
nothing
the
colonel
had
to
get
up
and
stand
to
get
room
for
his
amazement
to
expand
nothing
washington
i
ask
you
this
to
be
a
perpetual
member
and
the
only
perpetual
member
of
a
diplomatic
body
accredited
to
the
greatest
country
on
earth
do
you
call
that
nothing
it
was
washington
turn
to
be
amazed
he
was
stricken
dumb
but
the
wonder
the
reverent
admiration
expressed
in
his
face
were
more
eloquent
than
any
words
could
have
been
the
colonel
wounded
spirit
was
healed
and
he
resumed
his
seat
pleased
and
content
he
leaned
forward
and
said
impressively
what
was
due
to
a
man
who
had
become
forever
conspicuous
by
an
experience
without
precedent
in
the
history
of
the
world
a
man
made
permanently
and
diplomatically
sacred
so
to
speak
by
having
been
connected
temporarily
through
solicitation
with
every
single
diplomatic
post
in
the
roster
of
this
government
from
envoy
extraordinary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
to
the
court
of
james
all
the
way
down
to
consul
to
a
guano
rock
in
the
strait

disappeared
by
volcanic
convulsion
the
day
before
they
got
down
to
my
name
in
the
list
of
applicants
certainly
something
august
enough
to
be
answerable
to
the
size
of
this
unique
and
memorable
experience
was
my
due
and
i
got
it
by
the
common
voice
of
this
community
by
acclamation
of
the
people
that
mighty
utterance
which
brushes
aside
laws
and
legislation
and
from
whose
decrees
there
is
no
appeal
i
was
named
perpetual
member
of
the
diplomatic
body
representing
the
multifarious
sovereignties
and
civilizations
of
the
globe
near
the
republican
court
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
they
brought
me
home
with
a
torchlight
it
is
wonderful
colonel
simply
it
the
loftiest
official
position
in
the
whole
i
should
think
so
and
the
most
you
have
named
the
word
think
of
it
i
frown
and
there
is
war
i
smile
and
contending
nations
lay
down
their
it
is
awful
the
responsibility
i
it
is
nothing
responsibility
is
no
burden
to
me
i
am
used
to
it
have
always
been
used
to
and
the
work
the
work

you
have
to
attend

washington
was
silent
a
moment
then
a
deep
sigh
escaped
him
how
proud
i
was
an
hour
ago
how
paltry
seems
my
little
promotion
now
colonel
the
reason
i
came
to
washington
is
i
am
congressional
delegate
from
cherokee
strip
the
colonel
sprang
to
his
feet
and
broke

enthusiasm

you
ask
polly
if
i
washington
was
dazed
by
this
most
unexpected
demonstration
why
colonel
there
nothing
to
it
that
little
narrow
desolate
unpeopled
oblong
streak
of
grass
and
gravel
lost
in
the
remote
wastes
of
the
vast
continent
why
it
like
representing

billiard
table
a
discarded

a
great

staving
preferment

just
opulent

chapter

mrs
sellers
returned
now
with
her
composure
restored
and
began
to
ask
after
hawkins
wife
and
about
his
children
and
the
number
of
them
and
so
on
and
her
examination
of
the
witness
resulted
in
a
circumstantial
history
of
the
family
ups
and
downs
and
driftings
to
and
fro
in
the
far
west
during
the
previous
fifteen
years
there
was
a
message
now
from
out
back
and
colonel
sellers
went
out
there
in
answer
to
it
hawkins
took
this
opportunity
to
ask
how
the
world
had
been
using
the
colonel
during
the
past
oh
it
been
using
him
just
the
same
it
could
change
its
way
of
using
him
if
it
wanted
to
for
he
would
let
i
can
easily
believe
that
yes
you
see
he
does
change
himself
not
the
least
little
bit
in
the
world
he
always
mulberry
i
can
see
that
plain
just
the
same
old
scheming
generous
moonshiny
hopeful
failure
he
always
was
and
still
everybody
likes
him
just
as
well
as
if
he
was
the
shiningest
they
always
did
and
it
was
natural
because
he
was
so
obliging
and
accommodating
and
had
something
about
him
that
made
it
kind
of
easy
to
ask
help
of
him
or
favors
you
did
feel
shy
you
know
or
have
that
wish
you
did
have
to
try
feeling
that
you
have
with
other
it
just
so
yet
and
a
body
wonders
at
it
too
because
he
been
shamefully
treated
many
times
by
people
that
had
used
him
for
a
ladder
to
climb
up
by
and
then
kicked
him
down
when
they
did
need
him
any
more
for
a
time
you
can
see
he
hurt
his
pride
wounded
because
he
shrinks
away
from
that
thing
and
do
want
to
talk
about
it
and
so
i
used
to
think
now
he
learned
something
and
he
be
more
careful
hereafter
but
laws
in
a
couple
of
weeks
he
forgotten
all
about
it
and
any
selfish
tramp
out
of
nobody
knows
where
can
come
and
put
up
a
poor
mouth
and
walk
right
into
his
heart
with
his
boots
it
must
try
your
patience
pretty
sharply
oh
no
i
used
to
it
and
i
rather
have
him
so
than
the
other
way
when
i
call
him
a
failure
i
mean
to
the
world
he
a
failure
he
to
me
i
do
know
as
i
want
him
different
much
different
anyway
i
have
to
scold
him
some
snarl
at
him
you
might
even
call
it
but
i
reckon
i
do
that
just
the
same
if
he
was
different
it
my
make
but
i
a
good
deal
less
snarly
and
more
contented
when
he
a
failure
than
i
am
when
he
then
he
is
always
a
failure
said
hawking
brightening
him
oh
bless
you
no
he
makes
a
strike
as
he
calls
it
from
time
to
time
then
my
time
to
fret
and
fuss
for
the
money
just
flies
first
come
first
served
straight
off
he
loads
up
the
house
with
cripples
and
idiots
and
stray
cats
and
all
the
different
kinds
of
poor
wrecks
that
other
people
do
want
and
he
does
and
then
when
the
poverty
comes
again
i
got
to
clear
the
most
of
them
out
or
we
starve
and
that
distresses
him
and
me
the
same
of
course
here
old
and
old
jinny
that
the
sheriff
sold
south
one
of
the
times
that
we
got
bankrupted
before
the
war
they
came
wandering
back
after
the
peace
worn
out
and
used
up
on
the
cotton
plantations
helpless
and
not
another
lick
of
work
left
in
their
old
hides
for
the
rest
of
this
earthly
pilgrimage
and
we
so
pinched
oh
so
pinched
for
the
very
crumbs
to
keep
life
in
us
and
he
just
flung
the
door
wide
and
the
way
he
received
them
you
have
thought
they
had
come
straight
down
from
heaven
in
answer
to
prayer
i
took
him
one
side
and
said
we
ca
have
them
we
nothing
for
ourselves
we
ca
feed
them
he
looked
at
me
kind
of
hurt
and
said
them
out
and
they
come
to
me
just
as
confident
and
trusting
as
as
why
polly
i
must
have
bought
that
confidence
sometime
or
other
a
long
time
ago
and
given
my
note
so
to
speak
you
do
get
such
things
as
a
gift
and
how
am
i
going
to
go
back
on
a
debt
like
that
and
you
see
they
so
poor
and
old
and
friendless
and
but
i
was
ashamed
by
that
time
and
shut
him
off
and
somehow
felt
a
new
courage
in
me
and
so
i
said
softly
keep
them
the
lord
will
provide
he
was
glad
and
started
to
blurt
out
one
of
those
speeches
of
his
but
checked
himself
in
time
and
said
humbly
will
anyway
it
was
years
and
years
and
years
ago
well
you
see
those
old
wrecks
are
here
but
do
they
do
your
housework
laws
the
idea
they
would
if
they
could
poor
old
things
and
perhaps
they
think
they
do
do
some
of
it
but
it
a
superstition
waits
on
the
front
door
and
sometimes
goes
on
an
errand
and
sometimes
see
one
or
both
of
them
letting
on
to
dust
around
in
here
but
because
there
something
they
want
to
hear
about
and
mix
their
gabble
into
and
they
always
around
at
meals
for
the
same
reason
but
the
fact
is
we
have
to
keep
a
young
negro
girl
just
to
take
care
of
them
and
a
negro
woman
to
do
the
housework
and
help
take
care
of
well
they
ought
to
be
tolerably
happy
i
should
it
no
name
for
it
they
quarrel
together
pretty
much
all
the
time
most
always
about
religion
because
a
dunker
baptist
and
jinny
a
shouting
methodist
and
jinny
believes
in
special
providences
and
do
because
he
thinks
he
a
kind
of
a
and
they
play
and
sing
plantation
hymns
together
and
talk
and
chatter
just
eternally
and
forever
and
are
sincerely
fond
of
each
other
and
think
the
world
of
mulberry
and
he
puts
up
patiently
with
all
their
spoiled
ways
and
foolishness
and
so
ah
well
they
happy
enough
if
it
comes
to
that
and
i
do
mind
i
got
used
to
it
i
can
get
used
to
anything
with
mulberry
to
help
and
the
fact
is
i
do
much
care
what
happens
so
long
as
he
spared
to
well
here
to
him
and
hoping
he
make
another
strike
and
rake
in
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
and
turn
the
house
into
a
hospital
again
it
what
he
would
do
i
seen
aplenty
of
that
and
more
no
washington
i
want
his
strikes
to
be
mighty
moderate
ones
the
rest
of
the
way
down
the
well
then
big
strike
or
little
strike
or
no
strike
at
all
hoping
he
never
lack
for
friends
and
i
do
reckon
he
ever
will
while
there
people
around
who
know
enough
to
him
lack
for
friends
and
she
tilted
her
head
up
with
a
frank
pride
why
washington
you
ca
name
a
man
that
anybody
that
fond
of
him
i
tell
you
privately
that
i
had
satan
own
time
to
keep
them
from
appointing
him
to
some
office
or
other
they
knew
he
no
business
with
an
office
just
as
well
as
i
did
but
he
the
hardest
man
to
refuse
anything
to
a
body
ever
saw
mulberry
sellers
with
an
office
laws
goodness
you
know
what
that
would
be
like
why
they
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
see
a
circus
like
that
i
just
as
lieves
be
married
to
niagara
falls
and
done
with
after
a
reflective
pause
she
added
having
wandered
back
in
the
interval
to
the
remark
that
had
been
her
text
friends
oh
indeed
no
man
ever
had
more
and
such
friends
grant
sherman
sheridan
johnston
longstreet
lee
many
the
time
they
sat
in
that
chair
you
sitting
in
hawkins
was
out
of
it
instantly
and
contemplating
it
with
a
reverential
surprise
and
with
the
awed
sense
of
having
trodden
shod
upon
holy
ground
they
he
said
oh
indeed
yes
a
many
and
a
many
a
he
continued
to
gaze
at
the
chair
fascinated
magnetized
and
for
once
in
his
life
that
continental
stretch
of
dry
prairie
which
stood
for
his
imagination
was
afire
and
across
it
was
marching
a
slanting
flamefront
that
joined
its
wide
horizons
together
and
smothered
the
skies
with
smoke
he
was
experiencing
what
one
or
another
drowsing
geographically
ignorant
alien
experiences
every
day
in
the
year
when
he
turns
a
dull
and
indifferent
eye
out
of
the
car
window
and
it
falls
upon
a
certain
which
reads
mrs
sellers
went
gossiping
comfortably
along
oh
they
like
to
hear
him
talk
especially
if
their
load
is
getting
rather
heavy
on
one
shoulder
and
they
want
to
shift
it
he
all
air
you
know
breeze
you
may
say
and
he
freshens
them
up
it
a
trip
to
the
country
they
say
many
a
time
he
made
general
grant
laugh
and
that
a
tidy
job
i
can
tell
you
and
as
for
sheridan
his
eye
lights
up
and
he
listens
to
mulberry
sellers
the
same
as
if
he
was
artillery
you
see
the
charm
about
mulberry
is
he
is
so
catholic
and
unprejudiced
that
he
fits
in
anywhere
and
everywhere
it
makes
him
powerful
good
company
and
as
popular
as
scandal
you
go
to
the
white
house
when
the
president
holding
a
general
reception
sometime
when
mulberry
there
why
dear
me
you
ca
tell
which
of
them
it
is
that
holding
that
well
he
certainly
is
a
remarkable
man
and
he
always
was
is
he
religious
clear
to
his
marrow
does
more
thinking
and
reading
on
that
subject
than
any
other
except
russia
and
siberia
thrashes
around
over
the
whole
field
too
nothing
bigoted
about
what
is
his
religion
he
she
stopped
and
was
lost
for
a
moment
or
two
in
thinking
then
she
said
with
simplicity
i
think
he
was
a
mohammedan
or
something
last
washington
started
down
town
now
to
bring
his
trunk
for
the
hospitable
sellerses
would
listen
to
no
excuses
their
house
must
be
his
home
during
the
session
the
colonel
returned
presently
and
resumed
work
upon
his
plaything
it
was
finished
when
washington
got
back
there
it
is
said
the
colonel
all
what
is
it
for
colonel
oh
it
just
a
trifle
toy
to
amuse
the
washington
examined
it
it
seems
to
be
a
yes
that
what
it
is
i
call
it
pigs
in
the
clover
put
them
in
see
if
you
can
put
them
in
the
after
many
failures
washington
succeeded
and
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
it
wonderfully
ingenious
colonel
it
ever
so
clever
and
interesting
why
i
could
play
with
it
all
day
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
oh
nothing
patent
it
and
throw
it
do
you
do
anything
of
the
kind
there
money
in
that
a
compassionate
look
traveled
over
the
colonel
countenance
and
he
said
money
yes
pin
money
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
perhaps
not
washington
eyes
blazed
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
dollars
do
you
call
that
pin
money
the
colonel
rose
and
his
way
across
the
room
closed
a
door
that
was
slightly
ajar
his
way
to
his
seat
again
and
said
under
his
breath
you
can
keep
a
secret
washington
nodded
his
affirmative
he
was
too
awed
to
speak
you
have
heard
of
materialization
materialization
of
departed
spirits
washington
had
heard
of
it
and
probably
did
believe
in
it
and
quite
right
too
the
thing
as
practised
by
ignorant
charlatans
is
unworthy
of
attention
or
respect
where
there
a
dim
light
and
a
dark
cabinet
and
a
parcel
of
sentimental
gulls
gathered
together
with
their
faith
and
their
shudders
and
their
tears
all
ready
and
one
and
the
same
fatty
degeneration
of
protoplasm
and
humbug
comes
out
and
materializes
himself
into
anybody
you
want
grandmother
grandchild
witch
of
endor
john
milton
siamese
twins
peter
the
great
and
all
such
frantic
nonsense
no
that
is
all
foolish
and
pitiful
but
when
a
man
that
is
competent
brings
the
vast
powers
of
science
to
bear
it
a
different
matter
a
totally
different
matter
you
see
the
spectre
that
answers
that
call
has
come
to
stay
do
you
note
the
commercial
value
of
that
detail
well
i
the
the
truth
is
that
i
do
quite
know
that
i
do
do
you
mean
that
such
being
permanent
not
transitory
would
give
more
general
satisfaction
and
so
enhance
the
price
of
tickets
to
the
show
show
folly
listen
to
me
and
get
a
good
grip
on
your
breath
for
you
are
going
to
need
it
within
three
days
i
shall
have
completed
my
method
and
then
let
the
world
stand
aghast
for
it
shall
see
marvels
washington
within
three
days
ten
at
the
outside
you
shall
see
me
call
the
dead
of
any
century
and
they
will
arise
and
walk
walk
they
shall
walk
forever
and
never
die
again
walk
with
all
the
muscle
and
spring
of
their
pristine
colonel
indeed
it
does
take
one
breath
now
do
you
see
the
money
that
in
it
i
well
i
not
really
sure
that
i
great
scott
look
here
i
shall
have
a
monopoly

two
thousand
policemen
in
the
city
of
new
york
wages
four
dollars
a
day
i
replace
them
with
dead
ones
at
half
the
oh
prodigious
i
never
thought
of
that
thousand
dollars
a
day
now
i
do
begin
to
see
but
will
dead
policemen
answer
have
they
up
to
this
time
well
if
you
put
it
that
way
put
it
any
way
you
want
to
modify
it
to
suit
yourself
and
my
lads
shall
still
be
superior
they
wo
eat
they
wo

do
need
those
things
they
wo
wink
for
cash
at
gambling
dens
and
unlicensed
they
wo
spark
the
scullery
maids
and
moreover
the
bands
of
toughs
that
ambuscade
them
on
lonely
beats
and
cowardly
shoot
and
knife
them
will
only
damage
the
uniforms
and
not
live
long
enough
to
get
more
than
a
momentary
satisfaction
out
of
why
colonel
if
you
can
furnish
policemen
then
of
course
certainly
i
can
furnish
any
line
of
goods
that
wanted
take
the

instance
now
thousand
men

thousand

from
the
victorious
legions
of
all
the
ages
soldiers
that

horses
and
cost
never
a
cent
for

or
repairs
the
armies

i
will
replace
them

a
billion
i
will
dig
up
the
trained
statesmen
of
all
ages
and
all
climes
and
furnish
this
country
with
a
congress
that
knows
enough
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
a
thing
that
never
happened
yet
since
the
declaration
of
independence
and
never
will
happen
till
these
practically
dead
people
are
replaced
with
the
genuine
article
i
will
restock
the
thrones
of
europe
with
the
best
brains
and
the
best
morals
that
all
the
royal
sepulchres
of
all
the
centuries
can
furnish
which
is
promising
very
much
and
i
divide
the
wages
and
the
civil
list
fair
and
square
merely
taking
my
half
and
colonel
if
the
half
of
this
is
true
there
millions
in
it
billions
in
it
billions
that
what
you
mean
why
look
here
the
thing
is
so
close
at
hand
so
imminent
so
absolutely
immediate
that
if
a
man
were
to
come
to
me
now
and
say
colonel
i
am
a
little
short
and
if
you
could
lend
me
a
couple
of
billion
dollars
for
come
in
this
in
answer
to
a
knock
an
energetic
looking
man
bustled
in
with
a
big
in
his
hand
took
a
paper
from
it
and
presented
it
with
the
curt
remark
seventeenth
and
last
call
you
want
to
out
with
that
three
dollars
and
forty
cents
this
time
without
fail
colonel
mulberry
the
colonel
began
to
slap
this
pocket
and
that
one
and
feel
here
and
there
and
everywhere
muttering
what
have
i
done
with
that
wallet
let
me
see
um
not
here
not
there
oh
i
must
have
left
it
in
the
kitchen
i
just
run
and
no
you
wo
you
stay
right
where
you
are
and
you
going
to
disgorge
too
this
washington
innocently
offered
to
go
and
look
when
he
was
gone
the
colonel
said
the
fact
is
i
got
to
throw
myself
on
your
indulgence
just
this
once
more
suggs
you
see
the
remittances
i
was
expecting
hang
the
remittances
it
too
stale
it
wo
answer
come
the
colonel
glanced
about
him
in
despair
then
his
face
lighted
he
ran
to
the
wall
and
began
to
dust
off
a
peculiarly
atrocious
chromo
with
his
handkerchief
then
he
brought
it
reverently
offered
it
to
the
collector
averted
his
face
and
said
take
it
but
do
let
me
see
it
go
it
the
sole
remaining
rembrandt
that
rembrandt
be
damned
it
a
oh
do
speak
of
it
so
i
beg
you
it
the
only
really
great
original
the
only
supreme
example
of
that
mighty
school
of
art
which
art
it
the
sickest
looking
thing
i
the
colonel
was
already
bringing
another
horror
and
tenderly
dusting
it
take
this
one
too
the
gem
of
my
collection
the
only
genuine
fra
angelico
that
illuminated
that
what
it
is
give
it
here
good
day
people
will
think
i
robbed
a
nigger
as
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
the
colonel
shouted
with
an
anguished
accent
do
please
cover
them
up
do
let
the
damp
get
at
them
the
delicate
tints
in
the
angelico
but
the
man
was
gone
washington
and
said
he
had
looked
everywhere
and
so
had
mrs
sellers
and
the
servants
but
in
vain
and
went
on
to
say
he
wished
he
could
get
his
eye
on
a
certain
man
about
this
time
no
need
to
hunt
up
that
then
the
colonel
interest
was
awake
at
once
what
man
pete
they
call
him
out
there
out
in
the
cherokee
country
i
mean
robbed
the
bank
in
do
they
have
banks
in
tahlequah
yes
a
bank
anyway
he
was
suspected
of
robbing
it
whoever
did
it
got
away
with
more
than
twenty
thousand
dollars
they
offered
a
reward
of
five
thousand
i
believe
i
saw
that
very
man
on
my
way
no
is
that
so
i
certainly
saw
a
man
on
the
train
the
first
day
i
struck
the
railroad
that
answered
the
description
pretty
exactly
at
least
as
to
clothes
and
a
lacking
why
di
you
get
him
arrested
and
claim
the
reward
i
could
i
had
to
get
a
requisition
of
course
but
i
meant
to
stay
by
him
till
i
got
my
well
well
he
left
the
train
during
the
night
some
oh
hang
it
that
too
not
so
very
bad
why
because
he
came
down
to
baltimore
in
the
very
train
i
was
in
though
i
did
know
it
in
time
as
we
moved
out
of
the
station
i
saw
him
going
toward
the
iron
gate
with
a
satchel
in
his
good
we
catch
him
let
lay
a
send
description
to
the
baltimore
police
why
what
are
you
talking
about
no
do
you
want
them
to
get
the
reward
what
shall
we
do
then
the
colonel
reflected
i
tell
you
put
a
personal
in
the
baltimore
sun
word
it
like
this
a
drop
me
a
line
hold
on
which
arm
has
he
lost
the
good
now
then
a
drop
me
a
line
pete
even
if
you
have
to
write
with
your
left
hand
address
y
general
postoffice
washington
from
you
know
there
that
fetch
but
he
wo
know
who
will
he
no
but
he
want
to
know
wo
he
why
certainly
i
did
think
of
that
what
made
you
think
of
it
knowledge
of
human
curiosity
strong
trait
very
strong
now
i
go
to
my
room
and
write
it
out
and
enclose
a
dollar
and
tell
them
to
print
it
to
the
worth
of
chapter
iv
the
day
wore
itself
out
after
dinner
the
two
friends
put
in
a
long
and
harassing
evening
trying
to
decide
what
to
do
with
the
five
thousand
dollars
reward
which
they
were
going
to
get
when
they
should
find
pete
and
catch
him
and
prove
him
to
be
the
right
person
and
extradite
him
and
ship
him
to
tahlequah
in
the
indian
territory
but
there
were
so
many
dazzling
openings
for
ready
cash
that
they
found
it
impossible
to
make
up
their
minds
and
keep
them
made
up
finally
mrs
sellers
grew
very
weary
of
it
all
and
said
what
is
the
sense
in
cooking
a
rabbit
before
it
caught
then
the
matter
was
dropped
for
the
time
being
and
all
went
to
bed
next
morning
being
persuaded
by
hawkins
the
colonel
made
drawings
and
specifications
and
went
down
and
applied
for
a
patent
for
his
toy
puzzle
and
hawkins
took
the
toy
itself
and
started
out
to
see
what
chance
there
might
be
to
do
something
with
it
commercially
he
did
not
have
to
go
far
in
a
small
old
wooden
shanty
which
had
once
been
occupied
as
a
dwelling
by
some
humble
negro
family
he
found
a
yankee
engaged
in
repairing
cheap
chairs
and
other
furniture
this
man
examined
the
toy
indifferently
attempted
to
do
the
puzzle
found
it
not
so
easy
as
he
had
expected
grew
more
interested
and
finally
emphatically
so
achieved
a
success
at
last
and
asked
is
it
patented
patent
applied
that
will
answer
what
do
you
want
for
it
what
will
it
retail
for
well
cents
i
should
what
will
you
give
for
the
exclusive
right
i
could
give
twenty
dollars
if
i
had
to
pay
cash
down
but
tell
you
what
i
do
i
make
it
and
market
it
and
pay
you
five
cents
royalty
on
each
washington
sighed
another
dream
disappeared
no
money
in
the
thing
so
he
said
all
right
take
it
at
that
draw
me
a
he
went
his
way
with
the
paper
and
dropped
the
matter
out
of
his
mind
dropped
it
out
to
make
room
for
further
attempts
to
think
out
the
most
promising
way
to
invest
his
half
of
the
reward
in
case
a
partnership
investment
satisfactory
to
both
beneficiaries
could
not
be
hit
upon
he
had
not
been
very
long
at
home
when
sellers
arrived
sodden
with
grief
and
booming
with
glad
excitement
working
both
these
emotions
successfully
sometimes
separately
sometimes
together
he
fell
on
hawkins
neck
sobbing
and
said
oh
mourn
with
me
my
friend
mourn
for
my
desolate
house
death
has
smitten
my
last
kinsman
and
i
am
earl
of
rossmore
congratulate
me
he
turned
to
his
wife
who
had
entered
while
this
was
going
on
put
his
arms
about
her
and
said
you
will
bear
up
for
my
sake
my
lady
it
had
to
happen
it
was
she
bore
up
very
well
and
said
it
no
great
loss
simon
lathers
was
a
poor
useless
thing
and
no
account
and
his
brother
never
was
worth
the
rightful
earl
continued
i
am
too
much
prostrated
by
these
conflicting
griefs
and
joys
to
be
able
to
concentrate
my
mind
upon
affairs
i
will
ask
our
good
friend
here
to
break
the
news
by
wire
or
post
to
the
lady
gwendolen
and
instruct
her
to
what
lady
gwendolen
our
poor
daughter
who
alas
sally
sellers
mulberry
sellers
are
you
losing
your
mind
there
please
do
not
forget
who
you
are
and
who
i
am
remember
your
own
dignity
be
considerate
also
of
mine
it
were
best
to
cease
from
using
my
family
name
now
lady
goodness
gracious
well
i
never
what
am
i
to
call
you
then
in
private
the
ordinary
terms
of
endearment
will
still
be
admissible
to
some
degree
but
in
public
it
will
be
more
becoming
if
your
ladyship
will
speak
to
me
as
my
lord
or
your
lordship
and
of
me
as
rossmore
or
the
earl
or
his
lordship
and
oh
scat
i
ca
ever
do
it
but
indeed
you
must
my
love
we
must
live
up
to
our
altered
position
and
submit
with
what
grace
we
may
to
its
well
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
i
never
set
my
wishes
against
your
commands
yet
mul
my
lord
and
it
late
to
begin
now
though
to
my
mind
it
the
rottenest
foolishness
that
ever
spoken
like
my
own
true
wife
there
kiss
and
be
friends
but
gwendolen
i
do
know
how
i
am
ever
going
to
stand
that
name
why
a
body
would
know
sally
sellers
in
it
it
too
large
for
her
kind
of
like
a
cherub
in
an
ulster
and
it
a
most
outlandish
sort
of
a
name
anyway
to
my
you
not
hear
her
find
fault
with
it
my
that
a
true
word
she
takes
to
any
kind
of
romantic
rubbish
like
she
was
born
to
it
she
never
got
it
from
me
that
sure
and
sending
her
to
that
silly
college
has
helped
the
matter
any
just
the
other
now
hear
her
hawkins
college
is
the
selectest
and
most
aristocratic
seat
of
learning
for
young
ladies
in
our
country
under
no
circumstances
can
a
girl
get
in
there
unless
she
is
either
very
rich
and
fashionable
or
can
prove
four
generations
of
what
may
be
called
american
nobility
castellated
towers
and
turrets
and
an
imitation
moat
and
everything
about
the
place
named
out
of
sir
walter
scott
books
and
redolent
of
royalty
and
state
and
style
and
all
the
richest
girls
keep
phaetons
and
coachmen
in
livery
and
with
english
grooms
in
plug
hats
and
coats
and
and
a
without
any
whip
to
it
to
ride
feet
behind
them
and
they
do
learn
a
blessed
thing
washington
hawkins
not
a
single
blessed
thing
but
showy
rubbish
and
pretentiousness
but
send
for
the
lady
gwendolen
do
for
i
reckon
the
peerage
regulations
require
that
she
must
come
home
and
let
on
to
go
into
seclusion
and
mourn
for
those
arkansas
blatherskites
she
my
darling
blatherskites
remember
noblesse
there
there
talk
to
me
in
your
own
tongue
ross
you
do
know
any
other
and
you
only
botch
it
when
you
try
oh
do
stare
it
was
a
slip
and
no
crime
customs
of
a
ca
be
dropped
in
a
second
rossmore
there
now
be
appeased
and
go
along
with
you
and
attend
to
gwendolen
are
you
going
to
write
washington
or
telegraph
he
will
telegraph
i
thought
as
much
my
lady
muttered
as
she
left
the
room
wants
it
so
the
address
will
have
to
appear
on
the
envelop
it
will
just
make
a
fool
of
that
child
she
get
it
of
course
for
if
there
are
any
other
sellerses
there
they
not
be
able
to
claim
it
and
just
leave
her
alone
to
show
it
around
and
make
the
most
of
it
well
maybe
forgivable
for
that
she
so
poor
and
they
so
rich
of
course
had
her
share
of
snubs
from
the
sort
and
i
reckon
only
human
to
want
to
get
uncle
was
sent
with
the
telegram
for
although
a
conspicuous
object
in
a
corner
of
the
was
a
telephone
hanging
on
a
transmitter
washington
found
all
attempts
to
raise
the
central
office
vain
the
colonel
grumbled
something
about
its
being
always
out
of
order
when
you
got
particular
and
especial
use
for
it
but
he
explain
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
was
that
the
thing
was
only
a
dummy
and
had
any
wire
attached
to
it
and
yet
the
colonel
often
used
it
when
visitors
were
present
and
seemed
to
get
messages
through
it
mourning
paper
and
a
seal
were
ordered
then
the
friends
took
a
rest
next
afternoon
while
hawkins
by
request
draped
andrew
portrait
with
crape
the
rightful
earl
wrote
off
the
family
bereavement
to
the
usurper
in
england
a
letter
which
we
have
already
read
he
also
by
letter
to
the
village
authorities
at
duffy
corners
arkansas
gave
order
that
the
remains
of
the
late
twins
be
embalmed
by
some
louis
expert
and
shipped
at
once
to
the
usurper
with
bill
then
he
drafted
out
the
rossmore
arms
and
motto
on
a
great
sheet
of
brown
paper
and
he
and
hawkins
took
it
to
hawkins
yankee
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
came
back
with
a
couple
of
stunning
hatchments
which
they
nailed
up
on
the
front
of
the
house
attractions
calculated
to
draw
and
they
did
for
it
was
mainly
an
idle
and
shiftless
negro
neighborhood
with
plenty
of
ragged
children
and
indolent
dogs
to
spare
for
a
point
of
interest
like
that
and
keep
on
sparing
them
for
it
days
and
days
together
the
new
earl
found
without
surprise
this
society
item
in
the
evening
paper
and
cut
it
out
and
scrapbooked
it
by
a
recent
bereavement
our
esteemed
fellow
citizen
colonel
mulberry
sellers
perpetual
of
the
diplomatic
body
succeeds
as
rightful
lord
to
the
great
earldom
of
rossmore
third
by
order
of
precedence
in
the
earldoms
of
great
britain
and
will
take
early
measures
by
suit
in
the
house
of
lords
to
wrest
the
title
and
estates
from
the
present
usurping
holder
of
them
until
the
season
of
mourning
is
past
the
usual

comment
to
herself
receptions
people
who
do
rightly
know
him
may
think
he
is
commonplace
but
to
my
mind
he
is
one
of
the
most
unusual
men
i
ever
saw
as
for
suddenness
and
capacity
in
imagining
things
his
beat
exist
i
reckon
as
like
as
not
it
would
have
occurred
to
anybody
else
to
name
this
poor
old
rossmore
towers
but
it
just
comes
natural
to
him
well
no
doubt
it
a
blessed
thing
to
have
an
imagination
that
can
always
make
you
satisfied
no
matter
how
you
are
fixed
uncle
dave
hopkins
used
to
always
say
me
into
john
calvin
and
i
want
to
know
which
place
i
going
to
turn
me
into
mulberry
sellers
and
i
do
care
the
rightful
earl
comment
to
himself
it
a
beautiful
name
beautiful
pity
i
did
think
of
it
before
i
wrote
the
usurper
but
i
be
ready
for
him
when
he
chapter
no
answer
to
that
telegram
no
arriving
daughter
yet
nobody
showed
any
uneasiness
or
seemed
surprised
that
is
nobody
but
washington
after
three
days
of
waiting
he
asked
lady
rossmore
what
she
supposed
the
trouble
was
she
answered
tranquilly
oh
it
some
notion
of
hers
you
never
can
tell
she
a
sellers
all
through
at
least
in
some
of
her
ways
and
a
sellers
ca
tell
you
beforehand
what
he
going
to
do
because
he
do
know
himself
till
he
done
it
she
all
right
no
occasion
to
worry
about
her
when
she
ready
she
come
or
she
write
and
you
ca
tell
which
till
it
it
turned
out
to
be
a
letter
it
was
handed
in
at
that
moment
and
was
received
by
the
mother
without
trembling
hands
or
feverish
eagerness
or
any
other
of
the
manifestations
common
in
the
case
of
long
delayed
answers
to
imperative
telegrams
she
polished
her
glasses
with
tranquility
and
thoroughness
pleasantly
gossiping
along
the
while
then
opened
the
letter
and
began
to
read
aloud
kenilworth
keep
redgauntlet
hall
college
thursday
dear
precious
mamma
rossmore
oh
the
joy
of
it
you
ca
think
they
had
always
turned
up
their
noses
at
our
pretentions
you
know
and
i
had
fought
back
as
well
as
i
could
by
turning
up
mine
at
theirs
they
always
said
it
might
be
something
great
and
fine
to
be
the
rightful
shadow
of
an
earldom
but
to
merely
be
shadow
of
a
shadow
and
two
or
three
times
removed
at
that
and
i
always
retorted
that
not
to
be
able
to
show
four
generations
of
nobility
might
be
endurable
but
to
have
to
confess
such
an
origin
well
the
telegram
it
was
just
a
cyclone
the
messenger
came
right
into
the
great
rob
roy
hall
of
audience
as
excited
as
he
could
be
singing
out
dispatch
for
lady
gwendolen
sellers
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
simpering
chattering
assemblage
of
pinchbeck
aristocrats
turn
to
stone
i
was
off
in
the
corner
of
course
by
myself
it
where
cinderella
belongs
i
took
the
telegram
and
read
it
and
tried
to
i
could
have
done
it
if
i
had
had
any
preparation
but
it
was
all
so
sudden
you
know
but
no
matter
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
put
my
handkerchief
to
my
eyes
and
fled
sobbing
to
my
room
dropping
the
telegram
as
i
started
i
released
one
corner
of
my
eye
a
moment
just
enough
to
see
the
herd
swarm
for
the
telegram
and
then
continued
my
flight
just
as
happy
as
a
bird
then
the
visits
of
condolence
began
and
i
had
to
accept
the
loan
of
miss
hamilton
quarters
because
the
press
was
so
great
and
there
is
room
for
three
and
a
cat
in
mine
and
i
been
holding
a
lodge
of
sorrow
ever
since
and
defending
myself
against
people
attempts
to
claim
kin
and
do
you
know
the
very
first
girl
to
fetch
her
tears
and
sympathy
to
my
market
was
that
foolish
skimperton
girl
who
has
always
snubbed
me
so
shamefully
and
claimed
lordship
and
precedence
of
the
whole
college
because
some
ancestor
of
hers
some
time
or
other
was
a
mcallister
why
it
was
like
the
bottom
bird
in
the
menagerie
putting
on
airs
because
its
head
ancestor
was
a
pterodactyl
but
the
triumph
of
all
was
guess
but
you
never
this
is
it
that
little
fool
and
two
others
have
always
been
fussing
and
fretting
over
which
was
entitled
to
precedence
by
rank
you
know
they
nearly
starved
themselves
at
it
for
each
claimed
the
right
to
take
precedence
of
all
the
college
in
leaving
the
table
and
so
neither
of
them
ever
finished
her
dinner
but
broke
off
in
the
middle
and
tried
to
get
out
ahead
of
the
others
well
after
my
first
day
grief
and
seclusion
i
was
fixing
up
a
mourning
dress
you
see
i
appeared
at
the
public
table
again
and
then
what
do
you
think
those
three
fluffy
goslings
sat
there
contentedly
and
squared
up
the
long
famine
lapped
and
lapped
munched
and
munched
ate
and
ate
till
the
gravy
appeared
in
their
eyes
humbly
waiting
for
the
lady
gwendolen
to
take
precedence
and
move
out
first
you
see
oh
yes
i
been
having
a
darling
good
time
and
do
you
know
not
one
of
these
collegians
has
had
the
cruelty
to
ask
me
how
i
came
by
my
new
name
with
some
this
is
due
to
charity
but
with
the
others
it
is
they
refrain
not
from
native
kindness
but
from
educated
discretion
i
educated
them
well
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
settled
up
what
left
of
the
old
scores
and
snuffed
up
a
few
more
of
those
pleasantly
intoxicating
clouds
of
incense
i
shall
pack
and
depart
homeward
tell
papa
i
am
as
fond
of
him
as
i
am
of
my
new
name
i
could
put
it
stronger
than
that
what
an
inspiration
it
was
but
inspirations
come
easy
to
him
these
from
your
loving
daughter
gwendolen
hawkins
reached
for
the
letter
and
glanced
over
it
good
hand
he
said
and
full
of
confidence
and
animation
and
goes
racing
right
along
she
bright
that
oh
they
all
bright
the
sellerses
anyway
they
would
be
if
there
were
any
even
those
poor
latherses
would
have
been
bright
if
they
had
been
sellerses
i
mean
full
blood
of
course
they
had
a
sellers
strain
in
them
a
big
strain
of
it
too
but
being
a
bland
dollar
do
make
it
a
dollar
just
the
the
seventh
day
after
the
date
of
the
telegram
washington
came
dreaming
down
to
breakfast
and
was
set
wide
awake
by
an
electrical
spasm
of
pleasure
here
was
the
most
beautiful
young
creature
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
it
was
sally
sellers
lady
gwendolen
she
had
come
in
the
night
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
clothes
were
the
prettiest
and
the
daintiest
he
had
ever
looked
upon
and
the
most
exquisitely
contrived
and
fashioned
and
combined
as
to
decorative
trimmings
and
fixings
and
melting
harmonies
of
color
it
was
only
a
morning
dress
and
inexpensive
but
he
confessed
to
himself
in
the
english
common
to
cherokee
strip
that
it
was
a
and
now
as
he
perceived
the
reason
why
the
sellers
household
poverties
and
sterilities
had
been
made
to
blossom
like
the
rose
and
charm
the
eye
and
satisfy
the
spirit
stood
explained
here
was
the
magician
here
in
the
midst
of
her
works
and
furnishing
in
her
own
person
the
proper
accent
and
climaxing
finish
of
the
whole
my
daughter
major
hawkins
come
home
to
mourn
flown
home
at
the
call
of
affliction
to
help
the
authors
of
her
being
bear
the
burden
of
bereavement
she
was
very
fond
of
the
late
earl
idolized
him
sir
idolized
him
why
father
i
never
seen
true
she
right
i
was
thinking
of
another
er
of
her
mother
i
idolized
that
smoked
haddock
that
sentimental
spiritless
i
was
thinking
of
myself
poor
noble
fellow
we
were
inseparable
com
hear
the
man
mulberry
sel
mul
rossmore
hang
the
troublesome
name
i
can
never
if
i
heard
you
say
once
i
heard
you
say
a
thousand
times
that
if
that
poor
sheep
i
was
thinking
of
of
i
do
know
who
i
was
thinking
of
and
it
does
make
any
difference
anyway
somebody
idolized
him
i
recollect
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
and
father
i
am
going
to
shake
hands
with
major
hawkins
and
let
the
introduction
work
along
and
catch
up
at
its
leisure
i
remember
you
very
well
in
deed
major
hawkins
although
i
was
a
little
child
when
i
saw
you
last
and
i
am
very
very
glad
indeed
to
see
you
again
and
have
you
in
our
house
as
one
of
us
and
beaming
in
his
face
she
finished
her
cordial
shake
with
the
hope
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
he
was
prodigiously
pleased
by
her
outspoken
heartiness
and
wanted
to
repay
her
by
assuring
her
that
he
remembered
her
and
not
only
that
but
better
even
than
he
remembered
his
own
children
but
the
facts
would
not
quite
warrant
this
still
he
stumbled
through
a
tangled
sentence
which
answered
just
as
well
since
the
purport
of
it
was
an
awkward
and
unintentional
confession
that
her
extraordinary
beauty
had
so
stupefied
him
that
he
had
got
back
to
his
bearings
yet
and
therefore
be
certain
as
to
whether
he
remembered
her
at
all
or
not
the
speech
made
him
her
friend
it
could
well
help
it
in
truth
the
beauty
of
this
fair
creature
was
of
a
rare
type
and
may
well
excuse
a
moment
of
our
time
spent
in
its
consideration
it
did
not
consist
in
the
fact
that
she
had
eyes
nose
mouth
chin
hair
ears
it
consisted
in
their
arrangement
in
true
beauty
more
depends
upon
right
location
and
judicious
distribution
of
feature
than
upon
multiplicity
of
them
so
also
as
regards
color
the
very
combination
of
colors
which
in
a
volcanic
irruption
would
add
beauty
to
a
landscape
might
detach
it
from
a
girl
such
was
gwendolen
sellers
the
family
circle
being
completed
by
gwendolen
arrival
it
was
decreed
that
the
official
mourning
should
now
begin
that
it
should
begin
at
six
every
evening
the
dinner
hour
and
end
with
the
dinner
it
a
grand
old
line
major
a
sublime
old
line
and
deserves
to
be
mourned
for
almost
royally
almost
imperially
i
may
say
er
lady
gwendolen
but
she
gone
never
mind
i
wanted
my
peerage
i
fetch
it
myself
presently
and
show
you
a
thing
or
two
that
will
give
you
a
realizing
idea
of
what
our
house
is
i
been
glancing
through
burke
and
i
find
that
of
william
the
conqueror
natural
ch
my
dear
would
you
mind
getting
me
that
book
it
on
the
escritoire
in
our
boudoir
yes
as
i
was
saying
there
only
albans
buccleugh
and
grafton
ahead
of
us
on
the
list
all
the
rest
of
the
british
nobility
are
in
procession
behind
us
ah
thanks
my
lady
now
then
we
turn
to
william
and
we
find
letter
for
xyz
oh
splendid
when
you
get
it
last
night
but
i
was
asleep
before
you
came
you
were
out
so
late
and
when
i
came
to
breakfast
miss
gwendolen
well
she
knocked
everything
out
of
me
you
know
wonderful
girl
wonderful
her
great
origin
is
detectable
in
her
step
her
carriage
her
features
but
what
does
he
say
come
this
is
i
have
read
it
er
rossm
rossm
er
just
cut
it
short
like
that
it
the
english
way
i
open
it
ah
now
let
a
to
you
know
who
think
i
know
you
wait
ten
days
coming
to
washington
the
excitement
died
out
of
both
men
faces
there
was
a
brooding
silence
for
a
while
then
the
younger
one
said
with
a
sigh
why
we
ca
wait
ten
days
for
the
no
the
man
unreasonable
we
are
down
to
the
bed
rock
financially
if
we
could
explain
to
him
in
some
way
that
we
are
so
situated
that
time
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
us
yes
yes
that
it
and
so
if
it
would
be
as
convenient
for
him
to
come
at
once
it
would
be
a
great
accommodation
to
us
and
one
which
we
which
we
which
we
wh
well
which
we
should
sincerely
appreciate
that
it
and
most
gladly
reciprocate
certainly
that
fetch
him
worded
right
if
he
a
man
got
any
of
the
feelings
of
a
man
sympathies
and
all
that
he
be
here
inside
of
hours
pen
and
paper
come
we
get
right
at
between
them
they
framed
different
advertisements
but
none
was
satisfactory
a
main
fault
in
all
of
them
was
urgency
that
feature
was
very
troublesome
if
made
prominent
it
was
calculated
to
excite
pete
suspicion
if
modified
below
the
it
was
flat
and
meaningless
finally
the
colonel
resigned
and
said
i
have
noticed
in
such
literary
experiences
as
i
have
had
that
one
of
the
most
taking
things
to
do
is
to
conceal
your
meaning
when
you
are
trying
to
conceal
it
whereas
if
you
go
at
literature
with
a
free
conscience
and
nothing
to
conceal
you
can
turn
out
a
book
every
time
that
the
very
elect
ca
understand
they
all
then
hawkins
resigned
also
and
the
two
agreed
that
they
must
manage
to
wait
the
ten
days
some
how
or
other
next
they
caught
a
ray
of
cheer
since
they
had
something
definite
to
go
upon
now
they
could
probably
borrow
money
on
the
reward
enough
at
any
rate
to
tide
them
over
till
they
got
it
and
meantime
the
materializing
recipe
would
be
perfected
and
then
good
bye
to
trouble
for
good
and
all
the
next
day
may
the
tenth
a
couple
of
things
happened
among
others
the
remains
of
the
noble
arkansas
twins
left
our
shores
for
england
consigned
to
lord
rossmore
and
lord
rossmore
son
kirkcudbright
llanover
marjoribanks
sellers
viscount
berkeley
sailed
from
liverpool
for
america
to
place
the
reversion
of
the
earldom
in
the
hands
of
the
rightful
peer
mulberry
sellers
of
rossmore
towers
in
the
district
of
columbia
a
these
two
impressive
shipments
would
meet
and
part
in
five
days
later
and
give
no
sign
chapter
vi
in
the
course
of
time
the
twins
arrived
and
were
delivered
to
their
great
kinsman
to
try
to
describe
the
rage
of
that
old
man
would
profit
nothing
the
attempt
would
fall
so
far
short
of
the
purpose
however
when
he
had
worn
himself
out
and
got
quiet
again
he
looked
the
matter
over
and
decided
that
the
twins
had
some
moral
rights
although
they
had
no
legal
ones
they
were
of
his
blood
and
it
could
not
be
decorous
to
treat
them
as
common
clay
so
he
laid
them
with
their
majestic
kin
in
the
cholmondeley
church
with
imposing
state
and
ceremony
and
added
the
supreme
touch
by
officiating
as
chief
mourner
himself
but
he
drew
the
line
at
hatchments
our
friends
in
washington
watched
the
weary
days
go
by
while
they
waited
for
pete
and
covered
his
name
with
reproaches
because
of
his
calamitous
procrastinations
meantime
sally
sellers
who
was
as
practical
and
democratic
as
the
lady
gwendolen
sellers
was
romantic
and
aristocratic
was
leading
a
life
of
intense
interest
and
activity
and
getting
the
most
she
could
out
of
her
double
personality
all
day
long
in
the
privacy
of
her
sally
sellers
earned
bread
for
the
sellers
family
and
all
the
evening
lady
gwendolen
sellers
supported
the
rossmore
dignity
all
day
she
was
american
practically
and
proud
of
the
work
of
her
head
and
hands
and
its
commercial
result
all
the
evening
she
took
holiday
and
dwelt
in
a
rich
peopled
with
titled
and
coroneted
fictions
by
day
to
her
the
place
was
a
plain
unaffected
ramshackle
old
trap
just
that
and
nothing
more
by
night
it
was
rossmore
towers
at
college
she
had
learned
a
trade
without
knowing
it
the
girls
had
found
out
that
she
was
the
designer
of
her
own
gowns
she
had
no
idle
moments
after
that
and
wanted
none
for
the
exercise
of
an
extraordinary
gift
is
the
supremest
pleasure
in
life
and
it
was
manifest
that
sally
sellers
possessed
a
gift
of
that
sort
in
the
matter
of
within
three
days
after
reaching
home
she
had
hunted
up
some
work
before
pete
was
yet
due
in
washington
and
before
the
twins
were
fairly
asleep
in
english
soil
she
was
already
nearly
swamped
with
work
and
the
sacrificing
of
the
family
chromos
for
debt
had
got
an
effective
check
she
a
brick
said
rossmore
to
the
major
just
her
father
all
over
prompt
to
labor
with
head
or
hands
and
not
ashamed
of
it
capable
always
capable
let
the
enterprise
be
what
it
may
successful
by
nature
do
know
what
defeat
is
thus
intensely
and
practically
american
by
inhaled
nationalism
and
at
the
same
time
intensely
and
aristocratically
european
by
inherited
nobility
of
blood
just
me
exactly
mulberry
sellers
in
matter
of
finance
and
invention
after
office
hours
what
do
you
find
the
same
clothes
yes
but
what
in
them
rossmore
of
the
the
two
friends
had
haunted
the
general
daily
at
last
they
had
their
reward
toward
evening
on
the
of
may
they
got
a
letter
for
xyz
it
bore
the
washington
postmark
the
note
itself
was
not
dated
it
said
ash
barrel
back
of

post
black
horse
alley
if
you
are
playing
square
go
and
set
on
it
morning
not
sooner
not
later
wait
till
i
the
friends
cogitated
over
the
note
profoundly
presently
the
earl
said
do
you
reckon
he
afraid
we
are
a
sheriff
with
a
requisition
why
because
that
no
place
for
a
seance
nothing
friendly
nothing
sociable
about
it
and
at
the
same
time
a
body
that
wanted
to
know
who
was
roosting
on
that
without
exposing
himself
by
going
near
it
or
seeming
to
be
interested
in
it
could
just
stand
on
the
street
corner
and
take
a
glance
down
the
alley
and
satisfy
himself
do
you
see
yes
his
idea
is
plain
now
he
seems
to
be
a
man
that
ca
be
candid
and
straightforward
he
acts
as
if
he
thought
we
shucks
i
wish
he
had
come
out
like
a
man
and
told
us
what
hotel
he
now
you
struck
it
you
struck
it
sure
washington
he
has
told
has
he
yes
he
has
but
he
did
mean
to
that
alley
is
a
lonesome
little
pocket
that
runs
along
one
side
of
the
new
gadsby
that
his
what
makes
you
think
that
why
i
just
know
it
he
got
a
room
that
just
across
from
that
lamp
post
he
going
to
sit
there
perfectly
comfortable
behind
his
shutters
at
and
when
he
sees
us
sitting
on
the
say
to
himself
saw
one
of
those
fellows
on
the
train
and
then
he
pack
his
satchel
in
half
a
minute
and
ship
for
the
ends
of
the
hawkins
turned
sick
with
disappointment
oh
dear
it
all
up
colonel
it
exactly
what
he
indeed
he
wo
wo
he
why
because
you
wo
be
holding
the
ash
barrel
down
it
be
me
be
coming
in
with
an
officer
and
a
requisition
in
plain
clothes
the
officer
i
mean
the
minute
you
see
him
arrive
and
open
up
a
talk
with
well
what
a
head
you
have
got
colonel
sellers
i
never
should
have
thought
of
that
in
the
neither
would
any
earl
of
rossmore
betwixt
william
contribution
and
mulberry
as
earl
but
it
office
hours
now
you
see
and
the
earl
in
me
sleeps
come
i
show
you
his
very
they
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
new
gadsby
about
nine
in
the
evening
and
passed
down
the
alley
to
the
lamp
post
there
you
are
said
the
colonel
triumphantly
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
which
took
in
the
whole
side
of
the
hotel
there
it
is
what
did
i
tell
you
well
but
why
colonel
it
six
stories
high
i
do
quite
make
out
which
window
you
all
the
windows
all
of
them
let
him
have
his
choice
i
indifferent
now
that
i
have
located
him
you
go
and
stand
on
the
corner
and
wait
i
prospect
the
the
earl
drifted
here
and
there
through
the
swarming
lobby
and
finally
took
a
waiting
position
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
elevator
during
an
hour
crowds
went
up
and
crowds
came
down
and
all
complete
as
to
limbs
but
at
last
the
watcher
got
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
that
was
satisfactory
got
a
glimpse
of
the
back
of
it
though
he
had
missed
his
chance
at
the
face
through
waning
alertness
the
glimpse
revealed
a
cowboy
hat
and
below
it
a
plaided
sack
of
rather
loud
pattern
and
an
empty
sleeve
pinned
up
to
the
shoulder
then
the
elevator
snatched
the
vision
aloft
and
the
watcher
fled
away
in
joyful
excitement
and
rejoined
the
we
got
him
major
got
him
sure
i
seen
him
seen
him
good
and
i
do
care
where
or
when
that
man
approaches
me
backwards
recognize
him
every
time
we
all
right
now
for
the
they
got
it
after
the
delays
usual
in
such
cases
by
half
past
eleven
they
were
at
home
and
happy
and
went
to
bed
full
of
dreams
of
the
morrow
great
promise
among
the
elevator
load
which
had
the
suspect
for
was
a
young
kinsman
of
mulberry
sellers
but
mulberry
was
not
aware
of
it
and
did
see
him
it
was
viscount
berkeley
chapter
vii
arrived
in
his
room
lord
berkeley
made
preparations
for
that
first
and
last
and
duty
of
the
visiting
englishman
the
jotting
down
in
his
diary
of
his
impressions
to
date
his
preparations
consisted
in
ransacking
his
box
for
a
pen
there
was
a
plenty
of
steel
pens
on
his
table
with
the
ink
bottle
but
he
was
english
the
english
people
manufacture
steel
pens
for
of
the
globe
but
they
never
use
any
themselves
they
use
exclusively
the
quill
my
lord
not
only
found
a
quill
pen
but
the
best
one
he
had
seen
in
several
years
and
after
writing
diligently
for
some
time
closed
with
the
following
entry
but
in
one
thing
i
have
made
an
immense
mistake
i
ought
to
have
shucked
my
title
and
changed
my
name
before
i
started
he
sat
admiring
that
pen
a
while
and
then
went
on
all
attempts
to
mingle
with
the
common
people
and
become
permanently
one
of
them
are
going
to
fail
unless
i
can
get
rid
of
it
disappear
from
it
and
with
the
solid
protection
of
a
new
name
i
am
astonished
and
pained
to
see
how
eager
the
most
of
these
americans
are
to
get
acquainted
with
a
lord
and
how
diligent
they
are
in
pushing
attentions
upon
him
they
lack
english
servility
it
is
true
but
they
could
acquire
it
with
practice
my
quality
travels
ahead
of
me
in
the
most
mysterious
way
i
write
my
family
name
without
additions
on
the
register
of
this
hotel
and
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
pass
for
an
obscure
and
unknown
wanderer
but
the
clerk
promptly
calls
out
show
his
lordship
to
and
before
i
can
get
to
the
lift
there
is
a
reporter
trying
to
interview
me
as
they
call
it
this
sort
of
thing
shall
cease
at
once
i
will
hunt
up
the
american
claimant
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
accomplish
my
mission
then
change
my
lodging
and
vanish
from
scrutiny
under
a
fictitious
he
left
his
diary
on
the
table
where
it
would
be
handy
in
case
any
new
impressions
should
wake
him
up
in
the
night
then
he
went
to
bed
and
presently
fell
asleep
an
hour
or
two
passed
and
then
he
came
slowly
to
consciousness
with
a
confusion
of
mysterious
and
augmenting
sounds
hammering
at
the
gates
of
his
brain
for
admission
the
next
moment
he
was
sharply
awake
and
those
sounds
burst
with
the
rush
and
roar
and
boom
of
an
undammed
freshet
into
his
ears
banging
and
slamming
of
shutters
smashing
of
windows
and
the
ringing
clash
of
falling
glass
clatter
of
flying
feet
along
the
halls
shrieks
supplications
dumb
moanings
of
despair
within
hoarse
shouts
of
command
outside
cracklings
and
snappings
and
the
windy
roar
of
victorious
flames
bang
bang
bang
on
the
door
and
a
cry
turn
out
the
house
is
on
fire
the
cry
passed
on
and
the
banging
lord
berkeley
sprang
out
of
bed
and
moved
with
all
possible
speed
toward
the
in
the
darkness
and
the
gathering
smoke
but
fell
over
a
chair
and
lost
his
bearings
he
groped
desperately
about
on
his
hands
and
presently
struck
his
head
against
the
table
and
was
deeply
grateful
for
it
gave
him
his
bearings
again
since
it
stood
close
by
the
door
he
seized
his
most
precious
possession
his
journaled
impressions
of
america
and
darted
from
the
room
he
ran
down
the
deserted
hall
toward
the
red
lamp
which
he
knew
indicated
the
place
of
a
the
door
of
the
room
beside
it
was
open
in
the
room
the
gas
was
burning
full
head
on
a
chair
was
a
pile
of
clothing
he
ran
to
the
window
could
not
get
it
up
but
smashed
it
with
a
chair
and
stepped
out
on
the
landing
of
the
below
him
was
a
crowd
of
men
with
a
sprinkling
of
women
and
youth
massed
in
a
ruddy
light
must
he
go
down
in
his
spectral
night
dress
no
this
side
of
the
house
was
not
yet
on
fire
except
at
the
further
end
he
would
snatch
on
those
clothes
which
he
did
they
fitted
well
enough
though
a
trifle
loosely
and
they
were
just
a
shade
loud
as
to
pattern
also
as
to
hat
which
was
of
a
new
breed
to
him
buffalo
bill
not
having
been
to
england
yet
one
side
of
the
coat
went
on
but
the
other
side
refused
one
of
its
sleeves
was
turned
up
and
stitched
to
the
shoulder
he
started
down
without
waiting
to
get
it
loose
made
the
trip
successfully
and
was
promptly
hustled
outside
the
by
the
police
the
cowboy
hat
and
the
coat
but
half
on
made
him
too
much
of
a
centre
of
attraction
for
comfort
although
nothing
could
be
more
profoundly
respectful
not
to
say
deferential
than
was
the
manner
of
the
crowd
toward
him
in
his
mind
he
framed
a
discouraged
remark
for
early
entry
in
his
diary
it
is
of
no
use
they
know
a
lord
through
any
disguise
and
show
awe
of
him
even
something
very
like
fear
presently
one
of
the
gaping
and
adoring
of
boys
ventured
a
timid
question
my
lord
answered
it
the
boys
glanced
wonderingly
at
each
other
and
from
somewhere
fell
the
comment
english
cowboy
well
if
that
ai
another
mental
note
to
be
preserved
for
the
diary
cowboy
now
what
might
a
cowboy
be
perhaps
but
the
viscount
perceived
that
some
more
questions
were
about
to
be
asked
so
he
worked
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
released
the
sleeve
put
on
the
coat
and
wandered
away
to
seek
a
humble
and
obscure
lodging
he
found
it
and
went
to
bed
and
was
soon
asleep
in
the
morning
he
examined
his
clothes
they
were
rather
assertive
it
seemed
to
him
but
they
were
new
and
clean
at
any
rate
there
was
considerable
property
in
the
pockets
item
five
dollar
bills
item
near
fifty
dollars
in
small
bills
and
silver
plug
of
tobacco
which
refuses
to
open
found
to
contain
whiskey
memorandum
book
bearing
no
name
scattering
entries
in
it
recording
in
a
sprawling
ignorant
hand
appointments
bets
and
so
on
with
people
of
strange
hyphenated
name
jake
and
the
like
no
letters
no
documents
the
young
man
muses
maps
out
his
course
his
letter
of
credit
is
burned
he
will
borrow
the
small
bills
and
the
silver
in
these
pockets
apply
part
of
it
to
advertising
for
the
owner
and
use
the
rest
for
sustenance
while
he
seeks
work
he
sends
out
for
the
morning
paper
next
and
proceeds
to
read
about
the
fire
the
biggest
line
in
the
announces
his
own
death
the
body
of
the
account
furnishes
all
the
particulars
and
tells
how
with
the
inherited
heroism
of
his
caste
he
went
on
saving
women
and
children
until
escape
for
himself
was
impossible
then
with
the
eyes
of
weeping
multitudes
upon
him
he
stood
with
folded
arms
and
sternly
awaited
the
approach
of
the
devouring
fiend
and
so
standing
amid
a
tossing
sea
of
flame
and
billows
of
smoke
the
noble
young
heir
of
the
great
house
of
rossmore
was
caught
up
in
a
whirlwind
of
fiery
glory
and
disappeared
forever
from
the
vision
of
the
thing
was
so
fine
and
generous
and
knightly
that
it
brought
the
moisture
to
his
eyes
presently
he
said
to
himself
what
to
do
is
as
plain
as
day
now
my
lord
berkeley
is
dead
let
him
stay
so
died
creditably
too
that
will
make
the
calamity
the
easier
for
my
father
and
i
do
have
to
report
to
the
american
claimant
now
yes
nothing
could
be
better
than
the
way
matters
have
turned
out
i
have
only
to
furnish
myself
with
a
new
name
and
take
my
new
start
in
life
totally
untrammeled
now
i
breathe
my
first
breath
of
real
freedom
and
how
fresh
and
breezy
and
inspiring
it
is
at
last
i
am
a
man
a
man
on
equal
terms
with
my
neighbor
and
by
my
manhood
and
by
it
alone
i
shall
rise
and
be
seen
of
the
world
or
i
shall
sink
from
sight
and
deserve
it
this
is
the
gladdest
day
and
the
proudest
that
ever
poured
it
sun
upon
my
head
chapter

hawkins
the

dropped
from
the

what
is
it
he
gone
the
bright
the
young
the
gifted
the
noblest
of
his
illustrious
race
gone
gone
up

and

viscount

son
and

when
last
where
right
here
in
washington
where
he
arrived
from
england
last
night
the
papers
you
do
say
hotel
burned
what
hotel
the
new
gadsby
oh
my
goodness
and
have
we
lost
both
of
them
both
who
oh
great
guns
i
forgot
all
about
him
oh
i
hope
hope
well
i
should
say
oh
we
ca
spare
him
we
can
better
afford
to
lose
a
million
viscounts
than
our
only
support
and
they
searched
the
paper
diligently
and
were
appalled
to
find
that
a
man
had
been
seen
flying
along
one
of
the
halls
of
the
hotel
in
his
underclothing
and
apparently
out
of
his
head
with
fright
and
as
he
would
listen
to
no
one
and
persisted
in
making
for
a
stairway
which
would
carry
him
to
certain
death
his
case
was
given
over
as
a
hopeless
one
poor
fellow
sighed
hawkins
and
he
had
friends
so
near
i
wish
we
had
come
away
from
there
maybe
we
could
have
saved
the
earl
looked
up
and
said
calmly
his
being
dead
does
matter
he
was
uncertain
before
we
got
him
sure
this
got
him
how
i
will
materialize
rossmore
do
do
trifle
with
me
do
you
mean
that
can
you
do
it
i
can
do
it
just
as
sure
as
you
are
sitting
there
and
i
give
me
your
hand
and
let
me
have
the
comfort
of
shaking
it
i
was
perishing
and
you
have
put
new
life
into
me
get
at
it
oh
get
at
it
right
it
will
take
a
little
time
hawkins
but
there
no
hurry
none
in
the
world
in
the
circumstances
and
of
course
certain
duties
have
devolved
upon
me
now
which
necessarily
claim
my
first
attention
this
poor
young
nobleman
why
yes
i
am
sorry
for
my
heartlessness
and
you
smitten
with
this
new
family
affliction
of
course
you
must
materialize
him
first
i
quite
understand
i
i
well
i
was
meaning
just
that
but
why
what
am
i
thinking
of
of
course
i
must
materialize
him
oh
hawkins
selfishness
is
the
bottom
trait
in
human
nature
i
was
only
thinking
that
now
with
the
usurper
heir
out
of
the
way
but
you
forgive
that
momentary
weakness
and
forget
it
do
ever
remember
it
against
me
that
mulberry
sellers
was
once
mean
enough
to
think
the
thought
that
i
was
thinking
i
materialise
him
i
will
on
my
honor
and
i
do
it
were
he
a
thousand
heirs
jammed
into
one
and
stretching
in
a
solid
rank
from
here
to
the
stolen
estates
of
rossmore
and
barring
the
road
forever
to
the
rightful
earl
there
spoke
the
real
sellers
the
other
had
a
false
ring
old
hawkins
my
boy
it
just
occurs
to
me
a
thing
i
keep
forgetting
to
mention
a
matter
that
we
got
to
be
mighty
careful
what
is
that
we
must
keep
absolutely
still
about
these
materializations
mind
not
a
hint
of
them
must
escape
not
a
hint
to
say
nothing
of
how
my
wife
and
daughter
sensitive
organizations
might
feel
about
them
the
negroes
would
stay
on
the
place
a
that
true
they
would
it
well
you
spoke
for
i
not
naturally
discreet
with
my
tongue
when
i
not
sellers
reached
out
and
touched
a
in
the
wall
set
his
eye
upon
the
rear
door
and
waited
touched
it
again
and
waited
and
just
as
hawkins
was
remarking
admiringly
that
the
colonel
was
the
most
progressive
and
most
alert
man
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
matter
of
impressing
into
his
service
every
modern
convenience
the
moment
it
was
invented
and
always
keeping
breast
to
breast
with
the
drum
major
in
the
great
work
of
material
civilization
he
forsook
the
button
which
any
wire
attached
to
it
rang
a
vast
dinner
bell
which
stood
on
the
table
and
remarked
that
he
had
tried
that
dry
battery
now
to
his
entire
satisfaction
and
had
got
enough
of
it
and
added
nothing
would
do
graham
bell
but
i
must
try
it
said
the
mere
fact
of
my
trying
it
would
secure
public
confidence
and
get
it
a
chance
to
show
what
it
could
do
i
told
him
that
in
theory
a
dry
battery
was
just
a
curled
darling
and
no
mistake
but
when
it
come
to
practice
sho
and
here
the
result
was
i
right
what
should
you
say
washington
hawkins
you
seen
me
try
that
button
twice
was
i
right
that
the
idea
did
i
know
what
i
was
talking
about
or
did
i
well
you
know
how
i
feel
about
you
colonel
sellers
and
always
have
felt
it
seems
to
me
that
you
always
know
everything
about
everything
if
that
man
had
known
you
as
i
know
you
he
would
have
taken
your
judgment
at
the
start
and
dropped
his
dry
battery
where
it
did
you
ring
marse
sellers
no
marse
sellers
den
it
was
you
marse
washington
i
heah
no
it
was
marse
washington
de
good
lan
who
did
ring
her
den
lord
rossmore
rang
it
the
old
negro
flung
up
his
hands
and
exclaimed
blame
my
skin
if
i
hai
gone
en
forgit
dat

when
a
bell
ring
for
anybody
en
old
marster
tell
me
to
clear
out
and
settle
it
in
the
kitchen
the
noise
of
the
quarreling
presently
sank
to
a
murmur
in
the
distance
and
the
earl
added
that
a
trouble
with
old
house
servants
that
were
your
slaves
once
and
have
been
your
personal
friends
yes
and
members
of
the
members
of
the
family
is
just
what
they
become
the
members
of
the
family
in
fact
and
sometimes
master
and
mistress
of
the
household
these
two
are
mighty
good
and
loving
and
faithful
and
honest
but
hang
it
they
do
just
about
as
they
please
they
chip
into
a
conversation
whenever
they
want
to
and
the
plain
fact
is
they
ought
to
be
it
was
a
random
remark
but
it
gave
him
an
idea
however
nothing
could
happen
without
that
result
what
i
wanted
hawkins
was
to
send
for
the
family
and
break
the
news
to
o
never
mind
bothering
with
the
servants
then
i
will
go
and
bring
them
while
he
was
gone
the
earl
worked
his
idea
yes
he
said
to
himself
when
i
got
the
materializing
down
to
a
certainty
i
will
get
hawkins
to
kill
them
and
after
that
they
will
be
under
better
control
without
doubt
a
materialized
negro
could
easily
be
hypnotized
into
a
state
resembling
silence
and
this
could
be
made
permanent
yes
and
also
modifiable
at
will
sometimes
very
silent
sometimes
turn
on
more
talk
more
action
more
emotion
according
to
what
you
want
it
a
prime
good
idea
make
it
adjustable
with
a
screw
or
the
two
ladies
entered
now
with
hawkins
and
the
two
negroes
followed
uninvited
and
fell
to
brushing
and
dusting
around
for
they
perceived
that
there
was
matter
of
interest
to
the
fore
and
were
willing
to
find
out
what
it
was
sellers
broke
the
news
with
stateliness
and
ceremony
first
warning
the
ladies
with
gentle
art
that
a
pang
of
peculiar
sharpness
was
about
to
be
inflicted
upon
their
hearts
hearts
still
sore
from
a
like
hurt
still
lamenting
a
like
loss
then
he
took
the
paper
and
with
trembling
lips
and
with
tears
in
his
voice
he
gave
them
that
heroic
the
result
was
a
very
genuine
outbreak
of
sorrow
and
sympathy
from
all
the
hearers
the
elder
lady
cried
thinking
how
proud
that
young
hero
mother
would
be
if
she
were
living
and
how
unappeasable
her
grief
and
the
two
old
servants
cried
with
her
and
spoke
out
their
applauses
and
their
pitying
lamentations
with
the
eloquent
sincerity
and
simplicity
native
to
their
race
gwendolen
was
touched
and
the
romantic
side
of
her
nature
was
strongly
wrought
upon
she
said
that
such
a
nature
as
that
young
man
was
rarely
and
truly
noble
and
nearly
perfect
and
that
with
nobility
of
birth
added
it
was
entirely
perfect
for
such
a
man
she
could
endure
all
things
suffer
all
things
even
to
the
sacrificing
of
her
life
she
wished
she
could
have
seen
him
the
slightest
the
most
momentary
contact
with
such
a
spirit
would
have
ennobled
her
whole
character
and
made
ignoble
thoughts
and
ignoble
acts
thereafter
impossible
to
her
forever
have
they
found
the
body
rossmore
asked
the
wife
yes
that
is
they
found
several
it
must
be
one
of
them
but
none
of
them
are
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
am
going
down
there
and
identify
one
of
them
and
send
it
home
to
the
stricken
but
papa
did
you
ever
see
the
young
man
no
how
will
you
identify
it
i
well
you
know
it
says
none
of
them
are
recognizable
i
send
his
father
one
of
them
there
probably
no
gwendolen
knew
it
was
not
worth
while
to
argue
the
matter
further
since
her
father
mind
was
made
up
and
there
was
a
chance
for
him
to
appear
upon
that
sad
scene
down
yonder
in
an
authentic
and
official
way
so
she
said
no
more
till
he
asked
for
a
basket
a
basket
papa
what
for
it
might
be
chapter
ix
the
earl
and
washington
started
on
the
sorrowful
errand
talking
as
they
walked
and
as
usual
what
colonel
seven
of
them
in
that
hotel
actresses
and
all
burnt
out
of
any
of
them
burnt
up
oh
no
they
escaped
they
always
do
but
there
never
a
one
of
them
that
knows
enough
to
fetch
out
her
jewelry
with
that
strange
it
the
most
unaccountable
thing
in
the
world
experience
teaches
them
nothing
they
ca
seem
to
learn
anything
except
out
of
a
book
in
some
cases
there
manifestly
a
fatality
about
it
for
instance
take
that
plays
those
sensational
thunder
and
lightning
parts
she
got
a
perfectly
immense
reputation
draws
like
a
and
it
all
came
from
getting
burnt
out
in
why
how
could
that
give
her
a
reputation
as
an
actress
it
did
it
only
made
her
name
familiar
people
want
to
see
her
play
because
her
name
is
familiar
but
they
do
know
what
made
it
familiar
because
they
do
remember
first
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
and
absolutely
obscure
wages
thirteen
dollars
a
week
and
find
her
own
pads
yes
things
to
fat
up
her
spindles
with
so
as
to
be
plump
and
attractive
well
she
got
burnt
out
in
a
hotel
and
lost
worth
of
she
where
she
get
them
goodness
knows
given
to
her
no
doubt
by
spoony
young
flats
and
sappy
old
in
the
front
row
all
the
papers
were
full
of
it
she
struck
for
higher
pay
and
got
it
well
she
got
burnt
out
again
and
lost
all
her
diamonds
and
it
gave
her
such
a
lift
that
she
went
well
if
hotel
fires
are
all
she
got
to
depend
on
to
keep
up
her
name
it
a
pretty
precarious
kind
of
a
reputation
i
should
not
with
her
no
anything
but
that
because
she
so
lucky
born
lucky
i
reckon
every
time
there
a
hotel
fire
she
in
it
always
there
and
if
she
ca
be
there
herself
her
diamonds
are
now
you
ca
make
anything
out
of
that
but
just
sheer
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
she
must
have
lost
quarts
of
quarts
she
lost
bushels
of
them
it
got
so
that
the
hotels
are
superstitious
about
her
they
wo
let
her
in
they
think
there
will
be
a
fire
and
besides
if
she
there
it
cancels
the
insurance
she
been
waning
a
little
lately
but
this
fire
will
set
her
up
she
lost
worth
last
i
think
she
a
fool
if
i
had
worth
of
diamonds
i
trust
them
in
a
i
would
either
but
you
ca
teach
an
actress
that
this
been
burnt
out
times
and
yet
if
there
a
hotel
fire
in
san
francisco
she
got
to
bleed
again
you
mark
my
words
perfect
ass
they
say
she
got
diamonds
in
every
hotel
in
the
when
they
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
fire
the
poor
old
earl
took
one
glimpse
at
the
melancholy
morgue
and
turned
away
his
face
overcome
by
the
spectacle
he
said
it
is
too
true
hawkins
recognition
is
impossible
not
one
of
the
five
could
be
identified
by
its
nearest
friend
you
make
the
selection
i
ca
bear
which
one
had
i
better
oh
take
any
of
them
pick
out
the
best
however
the
officers
assured
the
earl
for
they
knew
him
everybody
in
washington
knew
him
that
the
position
in
which
these
bodies
were
found
made
it
impossible
that
any
one
of
them
could
be
that
of
his
noble
young
kinsman
they
pointed
out
the
spot
where
if
the
newspaper
account
was
correct
he
must
have
sunk
down
to
destruction
and
at
a
wide
distance
from
this
spot
they
showed
him
where
the
young
man
must
have
gone
down
in
case
he
was
suffocated
in
his
room
and
they
showed
still
a
third
place
quite
remote
where
he
might
possibly
have
found
his
death
if
perchance
he
tried
to
escape
by
the
side
exit
toward
the
rear
the
old
colonel
brushed
away
a
tear
and
said
to
hawkins
as
it
turns
out
there
was
something
prophetic
in
my
fears
yes
a
matter
of
ashes
will
you
kindly
step
to
a
grocery
and
fetch
a
couple
more
baskets
reverently
they
got
a
basket
of
ashes
from
each
of
those
now
hallowed
spots
and
carried
them
home
to
consult
as
to
the
best
manner
of
forwarding
them
to
england
and
also
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
lie
in
state
a
mark
of
respect
which
the
colonel
deemed
obligatory
considering
the
high
rank
of
the
deceased
they
set
the
baskets
on
the
table
in
what
was
formerly
the
library
and
workshop
now
the
hall
of
audience
and
went
up
stairs
to
the
lumber
room
to
see
if
they
could
find
a
british
flag
to
use
as
a
part
of
the
outfit
proper
to
the
lying
in
state
a
moment
later
lady
rossmore
came
in
from
the
street
and
caught
sight
of
the
baskets
just
as
old
jinny
crossed
her
field
of
vision
she
quite
lost
her
patience
and
said
well
what
will
you
do
next
what
in
the
world
possessed
you
to
clutter
up
the
parlor
table
with
these
baskets
of
ashes
ashes
and
she
came
to
look
she
put
up
her
hands
in
pathetic
astonishment
well
i
never
see
de
like
did
you
do
it
who
me
clah
to
goodness
it
de
fust
time
i
sot
eyes
on
miss
polly
dat
dat
ole
moke
is
losin
his
but
it
was
for
he
was
called
and
denied
it
dey
ai
no
way
to
dat
wen
hit
one
er
common
a
body
kin
reckon
maybe
de
cat
oh
and
a
shudder
shook
lady
rossmore
to
her
foundations
i
see
it
all
keep
away
from
them
they
his
m
lady
yes
your
young
marse
sellers
from
england
that
burnt
she
was
alone
with
the
ashes
alone
before
she
could
take
half
a
breath
then
she
went
after
mulberry
sellers
purposing
to
make
short
work
of
his
program
whatever
it
might
be
for
said
she
when
his
sentimentals
are
up
he
a
numskull
and
there
no
knowing
what
extravagance
he
contrive
if
you
let
him
she
found
him
he
had
found
the
flag
and
was
bringing
it
when
she
heard
that
his
idea
was
to
have
the
remains
lie
in
state
and
invite
the
government
and
the
public
she
broke
it
up
she
said
your
intentions
are
all
right
they
always
are
you
want
to
do
honour
to
the
remains
and
surely
nobody
can
find
any
fault
with
that
for
he
was
your
kin
but
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
about
it
and
you
will
see
it
yourself
if
you
stop
and
think
you
ca
file
around
a
basket
of
ashes
trying
to
look
sorry
for
it
and
make
a
sight
that
is
really
solemn
because
the
solemner
it
is
the
more
it
is
anybody
can
see
that
it
would
be
so
with
one
basket
it
would
be
three
times
so
with
three
well
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
it
would
be
solemn
with
one
mourner
it
would
be
with
a
procession
and
there
would
be
five
thousand
people
here
i
do
know
but
it
would
be
pretty
near
ridiculous
i
think
it
would
no
mulberry
they
ca
lie
in
state
it
would
be
a
mistake
give
that
up
and
think
of
something
so
he
gave
it
up
and
not
reluctantly
when
he
had
thought
it
over
and
realized
how
right
her
instinct
was
he
concluded
to
merely
sit
up
with
the
remains
just
himself
and
hawkins
even
this
seemed
a
doubtful
attention
to
his
wife
but
she
offered
no
objection
for
it
was
plain
that
he
had
a
quite
honest
and
desire
to
do
the
friendly
and
honourable
thing
by
these
forlorn
poor
relics
which
could
command
no
hospitality
in
this
far
off
land
of
strangers
but
his
he
draped
the
flag
about
the
baskets
put
some
crape
on
the
and
said
with
satisfaction
there
he
is
as
comfortable
now
as
we
can
make
him
in
the
circumstances
except
yes
we
must
strain
a
point
there
one
must
do
as
one
would
wish
to
be
done
by
he
must
have
have
what
dear
the
wife
felt
that
the
was
standing
about
all
it
could
well
stand
in
that
way
the
prospect
of
another
stunning
decoration
of
that
nature
distressed
her
and
she
wished
the
thing
had
not
occurred
to
him
she
said
hesitatingly
but
i
thought
such
an
honour
as
that
was
allowed
to
any
but
very
very
near
relations
who
right
you
are
quite
right
my
lady
perfectly
right
but
there
any
nearer
relatives
than
relatives
by
usurpation
we
can
not
avoid
it
we
are
slaves
of
aristocratic
custom
and
must
the
hatchments
were
unnecessarily
generous
each
being
as
large
as
a
blanket
and
they
were
unnecessarily
volcanic
too
as
to
variety
and
violence
of
color
but
they
pleased
the
earl
barbaric
eye
and
they
satisfied
his
taste
for
symmetry
and
completeness
too
for
they
left
no
waste
room
to
speak
of
on
the
lady
rossmore
and
her
daughter
assisted
at
the
till
near
midnight
and
helped
the
gentlemen
to
consider
what
ought
to
be
done
next
with
the
remains
rossmore
thought
they
ought
to
be
sent
home
with
a
committee
and
resolutions
at
once
but
the
wife
was
doubtful
she
said
would
you
send
all
of
the
baskets
oh
yes
all
at
once
to
his
father
oh
no
by
no
means
think
of
the
shock
no
one
at
a
time
break
it
to
him
by
would
that
have
that
effect
father
yes
my
daughter
remember
you
are
young
and
elastic
but
he
is
old
to
send
him
the
whole
at
once
might
well
be
more
than
he
could
bear
but
mitigated
one
basket
at
a
time
with
restful
intervals
between
he
would
be
used
to
it
by
the
time
he
got
all
of
him
and
sending
him
in
three
ships
is
safer
anyway
on
account
of
wrecks
and
i
do
like
the
idea
father
if
i
were
his
father
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
him
coming
in
that
in
that
on
the
installment
plan
suggested
hawkins
gravely
and
proud
of
being
able
to
help
yes
dreadful
to
have
him
coming
in
that
incoherent
way
there
would
be
the
strain
of
suspense
upon
me
all
the
time
to
have
so
depressing
a
thing
as
a
funeral
impending
delayed
waiting
unaccomplished
oh
no
my
child
said
the
earl
reassuringly
there
would
be
nothing
of
that
kind
so
old
a
gentleman
could
not
endure
a
suspense
like
that
there
will
be
three
lady
rossmore
looked
up
surprised
and
said
how
is
that
going
to
make
it
easier
for
him
it
a
total
mistake
to
my
mind
he
ought
to
be
buried
all
at
once
i
sure
of
i
should
think
so
too
said
hawkins
and
certainly
i
should
said
the
daughter
you
are
all
wrong
said
the
earl
you
will
see
it
yourselves
if
you
think
only
one
of
these
baskets
has
got
him
in
very
well
then
said
lady
rossmore
the
thing
is
perfectly
simple
bury
that
certainly
said
lady
gwendolen
but
it
is
not
simple
said
the
earl
because
we
do
not
know
which
basket
he
is
in
we
know
he
is
in
one
of
them
but
that
is
all
we
do
know
you
see
now
i
reckon
that
i
was
right
it
takes
three
funerals
there
is
no
other
and
three
graves
and
three
monuments
and
three
inscriptions
asked
the
daughter
well
yes
to
do
it
right
that
is
what
i
should
it
could
not
be
done
so
father
each
of
the
inscriptions
would
give
the
same
name
and
the
same
facts
and
say
he
was
under
each
and
all
of
these
monuments
and
that
would
not
answer
at
the
earl
nestled
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
no
he
said
that
is
an
objection
that
is
a
serious
objection
i
see
no
way
there
was
a
general
silence
for
a
while
then
hawkins
said
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
mixed
the
three
ramifications
together
the
earl
grasped
him
by
the
hand
and
shook
it
gratefully
it
solves
the
whole
problem
he
said
one
ship
one
funeral
one
grave
one
monument
it
is
admirably
conceived
it
does
you
honor
major
hawkins
it
has
relieved
me
of
a
most
painful
embarrassment
and
distress
and
it
will
save
that
poor
stricken
old
father
much
suffering
yes
he
shall
go
over
in
one
when
asked
the
wife
of
i
would
wait
wait
why
you
do
want
to
break
that
childless
old
man
god
knows
i
do
then
wait
till
he
sends
for
his
son
remains
if
you
do
that
you
will
never
have
to
give
him
the
last
and
sharpest
pain
a
parent
can
know
i
mean
the
certainty
that
his
son
is
dead
for
he
will
never
why
wo
he
because
to
send
and
find
out
the
truth
would
rob
him
of
the
one
precious
thing
left
him
the
uncertainty
the
dim
hope
that
maybe
after
all
his
boy
escaped
and
he
will
see
him
again
some
why
polly
he
know
by
the
papers
that
he
was
burnt
he
wo
let
himself
believe
the
papers
he
argue
against
anything
and
everything
that
proves
his
son
is
dead
and
he
will
keep
that
up
and
live
on
it
and
on
nothing
else
till
he
dies
but
if
the
remains
should
actually
come
and
be
put
before
that
poor
old
soul
oh
my
god
they
never
shall
polly
you
saved
me
from
a
crime
and
i
bless
you
for
it
always
now
we
know
what
to
do
we
place
them
reverently
away
and
he
shall
never
chapter
x
the
young
lord
berkeley
with
the
fresh
air
of
freedom
in
his
nostrils
was
feeling
invincibly
strong
for
his
new
career
and
yet
and
yet
if
the
fight
should
prove
a
very
hard
one
at
first
very
discouraging
very
taxing
on
untoughened
moral
sinews
he
might
in
some
weak
moment
want
to
retreat
not
likely
of
course
but
possibly
that
might
happen
and
so
on
the
whole
it
might
be
pardonable
caution
to
burn
his
bridges
behind
him
oh
without
doubt
he
must
not
stop
with
advertising
for
the
owner
of
that
money
but
must
put
it
where
he
could
not
borrow
from
it
himself
meantime
under
stress
of
circumstances
so
he
went
down
town
and
put
in
his
advertisement
then
went
to
a
bank
and
handed
in
for
deposit
what
name
he
hesitated
and
colored
a
little
he
had
forgotten
to
make
a
selection
he
now
brought
out
the
first
one
that
suggested
itself
howard
when
he
was
gone
the
clerks
marveling
said
the
cowboy
the
first
step
was
accomplished
the
money
was
still
under
his
command
and
at
his
disposal
but
the
next
step
would
dispose
of
that
difficulty
he
went
to
another
bank
and
drew
upon
the
first
bank
for
the
by
check
the
money
was
collected
and
deposited
a
second
time
to
the
credit
of
howard
tracy
he
was
asked
to
leave
a
few
samples
of
his
signature
which
he
did
then
he
went
away
once
more
proud
and
of
perfect
courage
saying
no
help
for
me
now
for
henceforth
i
could
draw
that
money
without
identification
and
that
is
become
legally
impossible
no
resources
to
fall
back
on
it
is
work
or
starve
from
now
to
the
end
i
am
ready
and
not
afraid
then
he
sent
this
cablegram
to
his
father
escaped
unhurt
from
burning
hotel
have
taken
fictitious
name
during
the
evening
while
he
was
wandering
about
in
one
of
the
outlying
districts
of
the
city
he
came
across
a
small
brick
church
with
a
bill
posted
there
with
these
words
printed
on
it
mechanics
club
debate
all
he
saw
people
apparently
mainly
of
the
working
class
entering
the
place
and
he
followed
and
took
his
seat
it
was
a
humble
little
church
quite
bare
as
to
ornamentation
it
had
painted
pews
without
cushions
and
no
pulpit
properly
speaking
but
it
had
a
platform
on
the
platform
sat
the
chairman
and
by
his
side
sat
a
man
who
held
a
manuscript
in
his
hand
and
had
the
waiting
look
of
one
who
is
going
to
perform
the
principal
part
the
church
was
soon
filled
with
a
quiet
and
orderly
congregation
of
decently
dressed
and
modest
people
this
is
what
the
chairman
said
the
essayist
for
this
evening
is
an
old
member
of
our
club
whom
you
all
know
parker
assistant
editor
of
the
daily
democrat
the
subject
of
his
essay
is
the
american
press
and
he
will
use
as
his
text
a
couple
of
paragraphs
taken
from
matthew
arnold
new
book
he
asks
me
to
read
these
texts
for
him
the
first
is
as
follows
says
somewhere
that
the
thrill
of
awe
that
is
to
say
reverence
is
the
best
thing
humanity
mr
arnold
other
paragraph
is
as
follows
should
say
that
if
one
were
searching
for
the
best
means
to
efface
and
kill
in
a
whole
nation
the
discipline
of
respect
one
could
not
do
better
than
take
the
american
parker
rose
and
bowed
and
was
received
with
warm
applause
he
then
began
to
read
in
a
good
round
resonant
voice
with
clear
enunciation
and
careful
attention
to
his
pauses
and
emphases
his
points
were
received
with
approval
as
he
went
on
the
essayist
took
the
position
that
the
most
important
function
of
a
public
journal
in
any
country
was
the
propagating
of
national
feeling
and
pride
in
the
national
name
the
keeping
the
people
in
love
with
their
country
and
its
institutions
and
shielded
from
the
allurements
of
alien
and
inimical
he
sketched
the
manner
in
which
the
reverent
turkish
or
russian
journalist
fulfilled
this
function
the
one
assisted
by
the
prevalent
discipline
of
respect
for
the
bastinado
the
other
for
siberia
continuing
he
said
the
chief
function
of
an
english
journal
is
that
of
all
other
journals
the
world
over
it
must
keep
the
public
eye
fixed
admiringly
upon
certain
things
and
keep
it
diligently
diverted
from
certain
others
for
instance
it
must
keep
the
public
eye
fixed
admiringly
upon
the
glories
of
england
a
processional
splendor
stretching
its
receding
line
down
the
hazy
vistas
of
time
with
the
mellowed
lights
of
a
thousand
years
glinting
from
its
banners
and
it
must
keep
it
diligently
diverted
from
the
fact
that
all
these
glories
were
for
the
enrichment
and
aggrandizement
of
the
petted
and
privileged
few
at
cost
of
the
blood
and
sweat
and
poverty
of
the
unconsidered
masses
who
achieved
them
but
might
not
enter
in
and
partake
of
them
it
must
keep
the
public
eye
fixed
in
loving
and
awful
reverence
upon
the
throne
as
a
sacred
thing
and
diligently
divert
it
from
the
fact
that
no
throne
was
ever
set
up
by
the
unhampered
vote
of
a
majority
of
any
nation
and
that
hence
no
throne
exists
that
has
a
right
to
exist
and
no
symbol
of
it
flying
from
any
flagstaff
is
righteously
entitled
to
wear
any
device
but
the
skull
and
crossbones
of
that
kindred
industry
which
differs
from
royalty
only
merely
as
retail
differs
from
wholesale
it
must
keep
the
citizen
eye
fixed
in
reverent
docility
upon
that
curious
invention
of
machine
politics
an
established
church
and
upon
that
bald
contradiction
of
common
justice
a
hereditary
nobility
and
diligently
divert
it
from
the
fact
that
the
one
damns
him
if
he
does
wear
its
collar
and
robs
him
under
the
gentle
name
of
taxation
whether
he
wears
it
or
not
and
the
other
gets
all
the
honors
while
he
does
all
the
work
the
essayist
thought
that
arnold
with
his
trained
eye
and
intelligent
observation
ought
to
have
perceived
that
the
very
quality
which
he
so
regretfully
missed
from
our
press
respectfulness
reverence
was
exactly
the
thing
which
would
make
our
press
useless
to
us
if
it
had
it
rob
it
of
the
very
thing
which
differentiates
it
from
all
other
journalism
in
the
world
and
makes
it
distinctively
and
preciously
american
its
frank
and
cheerful
irreverence
being
by
all
odds
the
most
valuable
of
all
its
qualities
for
its
mission
overlooked
by
arnold
is
to
stand
guard
over
a
nation
liberties
not
its
humbugs
and
he
thought
that
if
during
fifty
years
the
institutions
of
the
old
world
could
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
a
flouting
and
scoffing
press
like
ours
monarchy
and
its
attendant
crimes
would
disappear
from
monarchists
might
doubt
this
then
why
not
persuade
the
czar
to
give
it
a
trial
in
russia
concluding
he
said
well
the
charge
is
that
our
press
has
but
little
of
that
old
world
quality
reverence
let
us
be
candidly
grateful
that
it
is
so
with
its
limited
reverence
it
at
least
reveres
the
things
which
this
nation
reveres
as
a
rule
and
that
is
sufficient
what
other
people
revere
is
fairly
and
properly
matter
of
light
importance
to
us
our
press
does
not
reverence
kings
it
does
not
reverence
so
called
nobilities
it
does
not
reverence
established
ecclesiastical
slaveries
it
does
not
reverence
laws
which
rob
a
younger
son
to
fatten
an
elder
one
it
does
not
reverence
any
fraud
or
sham
or
infamy
howsoever
old
or
rotten
or
holy
which
sets
one
citizen
above
his
neighbor
by
accident
of
birth
it
does
not
reverence
any
law
or
custom
howsoever
old
or
decayed
or
sacred
which
shuts
against
the
best
man
in
the
land
the
best
place
in
the
land
and
the
divine
right
to
prove
property
and
go
up
and
occupy
it
in
the
sense
of
the
poet
goethe
that
meek
idolater
of
provincial
three
carat
royalty
and
nobility
our
press
is
certainly
bankrupt
in
the
thrill
of
awe
otherwise
reverence
reverence
for
nickel
plate
and
brummagem
let
us
sincerely
hope
that
this
fact
will
remain
a
fact
forever
for
to
my
mind
a
discriminating
irreverence
is
the
creator
and
protector
of
human
liberty
even
as
the
other
thing
is
the
creator
nurse
and
steadfast
protector
of
all
forms
of
human
slavery
bodily
and
mental
tracy
said
to
himself
almost
shouted
to
himself
i
glad
i
came
to
this
country
i
was
right
i
was
right
to
seek
out
a
land
where
such
healthy
principles
and
theories
are
in
men
hearts
and
minds
think
of
the
innumerable
slaveries
imposed
by
misplaced
reverence
how
well
he
brought
that
out
and
how
true
it
is
there
manifestly
prodigious
force
in
reverence
if
you
can
get
a
man
to
reverence
your
ideals
your
slave
oh
yes
in
all
the
ages
the
peoples
of
europe
have
been
diligently
taught
to
avoid
reasoning
about
the
shams
of
monarchy
and
nobility
been
taught
to
avoid
examining
them
been
taught
to
reverence
them
and
now
as
a
natural
result
to
reverence
them
is
second
nature
in
order
to
shock
them
it
is
sufficient
to
inject
a
thought
of
the
opposite
kind
into
their
dull
minds
for
ages
any
expression
of
irreverence
from
their
lips
has
been
sin
and
crime
the
sham
and
swindle
of
all
this
is
apparent
the
moment
one
reflects
that
he
is
himself
the
only
legitimately
qualified
judge
of
what
is
entitled
to
reverence
and
what
is
not
come
i
had
thought
of
that
before
but
it
is
true
absolutely
true
what
right
has
goethe
what
right
has
arnold
what
right
has
any
dictionary
to
define
the
word
irreverence
for
me
what
their
ideals
are
is
nothing
to
me
so
long
as
i
reverence
my
own
ideals
my
whole
duty
is
done
and
i
commit
no
profanation
if
i
laugh
at
theirs
i
may
scoff
at
other
people
ideals
as
much
as
i
want
to
it
is
my
right
and
my
privilege
no
man
has
any
right
to
deny
tracy
was
expecting
to
hear
the
essay
debated
but
this
did
not
happen
the
chairman
said
by
way
of
explanation
i
would
say
for
the
information
of
the
strangers
present
here
that
in
accordance
with
our
custom
the
subject
of
this
meeting
will
be
debated
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
club
this
is
in
order
to
enable
our
members
to
prepare
what
they
may
wish
to
say
upon
the
subject
with
pen
and
paper
for
we
are
mainly
mechanics
and
unaccustomed
to
speaking
we
are
obliged
to
write
down
what
we
desire
to
many
brief
papers
were
now
read
and
several
offhand
speeches
made
in
discussion
of
the
essay
read
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
club
which
had
been
a
laudation
by
some
visiting
professor
of
college
culture
and
the
grand
results
flowing
from
it
to
the
nation
one
of
the
papers
was
read
by
a
man
approaching
middle
age
who
said
he
had
had
a
college
education
that
he
had
got
his
education
in
a
printing
office
and
had
graduated
from
there
into
the
patent
office
where
he
had
been
a
clerk
now
for
a
great
many
years
then
he
continued
to
this
effect
the
essayist
contrasted
the
america
of
with
the
america
of
bygone
times
and
certainly
the
result
is
the
exhibition
of
a
mighty
progress
but
i
think
he
a
little
overrated
the
share
in
the
production
of
that
result
it
can
no
doubt
be
easily
shown
that
the
colleges
have
contributed
the
intellectual
part
of
this
progress
and
that
that
part
is
vast
but
that
the
material
progress
has
been
immeasurably
vaster
i
think
you
will
concede
now
i
have
been
looking
over
a
list
of
inventors
the
creators
of
this
amazing
material
development
and
i
find
that
they
were
not
men
of
course
there
are
exceptions
like
professor
henry
of
princeton
the
inventor
of
morse
system
of
telegraphy
but
these
exceptions
are
few
it
is
not
overstatement
to
say
that
the
material
development
of
this
century
the
only
century
worth
living
in
since
time
itself
was
invented
is
the
creation
of
men
not
we
think
we
see
what
these
inventors
have
done
no
we
see
only
the
visible
vast
frontage
of
their
work
behind
it
is
their
far
vaster
work
and
it
is
invisible
to
the
careless
glance
they
have
reconstructed
this
nation
made
it
over
that
is
and
metaphorically
speaking
have
multiplied
its
numbers
almost
beyond
the
power
of
figures
to
express
i
will
explain
what
i
mean
what
constitutes
the
population
of
a
land
merely
the
numberable
packages
of
meat
and
bones
in
it
called
by
courtesy
men
and
women
shall
a
million
ounces
of
brass
and
a
million
ounces
of
gold
be
held
to
be
of
the
same
value
take
a
truer
standard
the
measure
of
a
man
contributing
capacity
to
his
time
and
his
people
the
work
he
can
do
and
then
number
the
population
of
this
country
as
multiplied
by
what
a
man
can
now
do
more
than
his
grandfather
could
do
by
this
standard
of
measurement
this
nation
two
or
three
generations
ago
consisted
of
mere
cripples
paralytics
dead
men
as
compared
with
the
men
of
in
our
population
was
by
way
of
rude
but
striking
illustration
let
us
consider
for
argument
sake
that
four
of
these
millions
consisted
of
aged
people
little
children
and
other
incapables
and
that
the
remaining
were
divided
and
employed
as
follows
as
ginners
of
cotton
women
as
women
as
as
screw
makers
as
reapers
binders
etc
as
as
weavers
as
stitchers
of
shoe
soles
now
the
deductions
which
i
am
going
to
append
to
these
figures
may
sound
extravagant
but
they
are
not
i
take
them
from
miscellaneous
documents
no
second
session
congress
and
they
are
official
and
trustworthy
the
work
of
those
is
done
by
men
that
of
the
is
done
by
boys
that
of
the
is
done
by
girls
that
of
the
screw
makers
is
done
by
girls
that
of
the
reapers
binders
is
done
by
boys
that
of
the
is
done
by
men
that
of
the
weavers
is
done
by
men
and
that
of
the
stitchers
of
shoe
soles
is
done
by
men
to
bunch
the
figures
persons
do
the
whereas
fifty
years
ago
it
would
have
taken
thirteen
millions
of
persons
to
do
it
now
then
how
many
of
that
ignorant
race
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
with
their
ignorant
methods
would
it
take
to
do
our
work
it
would
take
forty
thousand
millions
a
hundred
times
the
swarming
population
of
china
twenty
times
the
present
population
of
the
globe
you
look
around
you
and
you
see
a
nation
of
sixty
millions
apparently
but
secreted
in
their
hands
and
brains
and
invisible
to
your
eyes
is
the
true
population
of
this
republic
and
it
numbers
forty
billions
it
is
the
stupendous
creation
of
those
humble
unlettered
inventors
all
honor
to
their
name
how
grand
that
is
said
tracy
as
he
wended
homeward
what
a
civilization
it
is
and
what
prodigious
results
these
are
and
brought
about
almost
wholly
by
common
men
not
by
aristocrats
but
men
who
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
humble
ranks
of
life
and
earn
the
bread
that
they
eat
again
i
glad
i
came
i
have
found
a
country
at
last
where
one
may
start
fair
and
breast
to
breast
with
his
fellow
man
rise
by
his
own
efforts
and
be
something
in
the
world
and
be
proud
of
that
something
not
be
something
created
by
an
ancestor
three
hundred
years
chapter
xi
during
the
first
few
days
he
kept
the
fact
diligently
before
his
mind
that
he
was
in
a
land
where
there
was
work
and
bread
for
in
fact
for
convenience
sake
he
fitted
it
to
a
little
tune
and
hummed
it
to
himself
but
as
time
wore
on
the
fact
itself
began
to
take
on
a
doubtful
look
and
next
the
tune
got
fatigued
and
presently
ran
down
and
stopped
his
first
effort
was
to
get
an
upper
clerkship
in
one
of
the
departments
where
his
oxford
education
could
come
into
play
and
do
him
service
but
he
stood
no
chance
whatever
there
competency
was
no
recommendation
political
backing
without
competency
was
worth
six
of
it
he
was
glaringly
english
and
that
was
necessarily
against
him
in
the
political
centre
of
a
nation
where
both
parties
prayed
for
the
irish
cause
on
the
and
blasphemed
it
in
the
cellar
by
his
dress
he
was
a
cowboy
that
won
him
respect
when
his
back
was
not
turned
but
it
could
get
a
clerkship
for
him
but
he
had
said
in
a
rash
moment
that
he
would
wear
those
clothes
till
the
owner
or
the
owner
friends
caught
sight
of
them
and
asked
for
that
money
and
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
retire
from
that
engagement
now
at
the
end
of
a
week
things
were
beginning
to
wear
rather
a
startling
look
he
had
hunted
everywhere
for
work
descending
gradually
the
scale
of
quality
until
apparently
he
had
sued
for
all
the
various
kinds
of
work
a
man
without
a
special
calling
might
hope
to
be
able
to
do
except
ditching
and
the
other
coarse
manual
sorts
and
had
got
neither
work
nor
the
promise
of
it
he
was
mechanically
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
diary
meanwhile
and
now
his
eye
fell
upon
the
first
record
made
after
he
was
burnt
out
i
myself
did
not
doubt
my
stamina
before
nobody
could
doubt
it
now
if
they
could
see
how
i
am
housed
and
realise
that
i
feel
absolutely
no
disgust
with
these
quarters
but
am
as
serenely
content
with
them
as
any
dog
would
be
in
a
similar
kennel
terms
dollars
a
week
i
said
i
would
start
at
the
bottom
i
have
kept
my
a
shudder
went
quaking
through
him
and
he
exclaimed
what
have
i
been
thinking
of
this
the
bottom
mooning
along
a
whole
week
and
these
terrific
expenses
climbing
and
climbing
all
the
time
i
must
end
this
folly
he
settled
up
at
once
and
went
forth
to
find
less
sumptuous
lodgings
he
had
to
wander
far
and
seek
with
diligence
but
he
succeeded
they
made
him
pay
in
advance
four
dollars
and
a
half
this
secured
both
bed
and
food
for
a
week
the
hardworked
landlady
took
him
up
three
flights
of
narrow
uncarpeted
stairs
and
delivered
him
into
his
room
there
were
two
in
it
and
one
single
one
he
would
be
allowed
to
sleep
alone
in
one
of
the
double
beds
until
some
new
boarder
should
come
but
he
would
be
charged
extra
so
he
would
presently
be
required
to
sleep
with
some
stranger
the
thought
of
it
made
him
sick
marsh
the
landlady
was
very
friendly
and
hoped
he
would
like
her
house
they
all
liked
it
she
said
and
they
a
very
nice
set
of
boys
they
carry
on
a
good
deal
but
that
their
fun
you
see
this
room
opens
right
into
this
back
one
and
sometimes
they
all
in
one
and
sometimes
in
the
other
and
hot
nights
they
all
sleep
on
the
roof
when
it
do
rain
they
get
out
there
the
minute
it
hot
enough
the
season
so
early
that
they
already
had
a
night
or
two
up
there
if
you
like
to
go
up
and
pick
out
a
place
you
can
you
find
chalk
in
the
side
of
the
chimney
where
there
a
brick
wanting
you
just
take
the
chalk
and
but
of
course
you
done
it
oh
no
i
why
of
course
you
have
what
am
i
thinking
of
plenty
of
room
on
the
plains
without
chalking
i
be
bound
well
you
just
chalk
out
a
place
the
size
of
a
blanket
anywhere
on
the
tin
that
ai
already
marked
off
you
know
and
that
your
property
you
and
your
take
turnabout
carrying
up
the
blanket
and
pillows
and
fetching
them
down
again
or
one
carries
them
up
and
the
other
fetches
them
down
you
fix
it
the
way
you
like
you
know
you
like
the
boys
everlasting
sociable
except
the
printer
he
the
one
that
sleeps
in
that
single
bed
the
strangest
creature
why
i
do
believe
you
could
get
that
man
to
sleep
with
another
man
not
if
the
house
was
afire
mind
you
i
not
just
talking
i
know
the
boys
tried
him
to
see
they
took
his
bed
out
one
night
and
so
when
he
got
home
about
three
in
the
morning
he
was
on
a
morning
paper
then
but
he
on
an
evening
one
now
there
was
any
place
for
him
but
with
the
and
if
you
believe
me
he
just
set
up
the
rest
of
the
night
he
did
honest
they
say
he
cracked
but
it
ai
so
he
english
they
awful
particular
you
wo
mind
my
saying
that
you
you
english
i
thought
so
i
could
tell
it
by
the
way
you
mispronounce
the
words
that
got
a
in
them
you
know
such
as
saying
loff
when
you
mean
laff
but
you
get
over
that
he
a
right
down
good
fellow
and
a
little
sociable
with
the
photographer
boy
and
the
caulker
and
the
blacksmith
that
work
in
the
navy
yard
but
not
so
much
with
the
others
the
fact
is
though
it
private
and
the
others
do
know
it
he
a
kind
of
an
aristocrat
his
father
being
a
doctor
and
you
know
what
style
that
is
in
england
i
mean
because
in
this
country
a
doctor
ai
so
very
much
even
if
he
that
but
over
there
of
course
it
different
so
this
chap
had
a
falling
out
with
his
father
and
was
pretty
high
strung
and
just
cut
for
this
country
and
the
first
he
knew
he
had
to
get
to
work
or
starve
well
he
been
to
college
you
see
and
so
he
judged
he
was
all
right
did
you
say
anything
no
i
only
and
there
where
he
was
mistaken
why
he
mighty
near
starved
and
i
reckon
he
would
have
starved
sure
enough
if
some
jour
printer
or
other
had
took
pity
on
him
and
got
him
a
place
as
apprentice
so
he
learnt
the
trade
and
then
he
was
all
right
but
it
was
a
close
call
once
he
thought
he
had
got
to
haul
in
his
pride
and
holler
for
his
father
and
why
you
sighing
again
is
anything
the
matter
with
you
does
my
clatter
oh
dear
no
pray
go
on
i
like
yes
you
see
he
been
over
here
ten
years
he
now
and
he
ai
pretty
well
satisfied
in
his
mind
because
he
ca
get
reconciled
to
being
a
mechanic
and
associating
with
mechanics
he
being
as
he
says
to
me
a
gentleman
which
is
a
pretty
plain
that
the
boys
ai
but
of
course
i
know
enough
not
to
let
that
cat
out
of
the
why
would
there
be
any
harm
in
it
harm
in
it
they
lick
him
would
they
would
you
of
course
you
would
do
you
ever
let
a
man
say
you
ai
a
gentleman
in
this
country
but
laws
what
am
i
thinking
about
i
reckon
a
body
would
think
twice
before
he
said
a
cowboy
was
a
a
trim
active
slender
and
very
pretty
girl
of
about
eighteen
walked
into
the
room
now
in
the
most
satisfied
and
unembarrassed
way
she
was
cheaply
but
smartly
and
gracefully
dressed
and
the
mother
quick
glance
at
the
stranger
face
as
he
rose
was
of
the
kind
which
inquires
what
effect
has
been
produced
and
expects
to
find
indications
of
surprise
and
admiration
this
is
my
daughter
hattie
we
call
her
puss
it
the
new
boarder
this
without
rising
the
young
englishman
made
the
awkward
bow
common
to
his
nationality
and
time
of
life
in
circumstances
of
delicacy
and
difficulty
and
these
were
of
that
sort
for
being
taken
by
surprise
his
natural
lifelong
self
sprang
to
the
front
and
that
self
of
course
would
not
know
just
how
to
act
when
introduced
to
a
chambermaid
or
to
the
heiress
of
a
boarding
house
his
other
self
the
self
which
recognized
the
equality
of
all
men
would
have
managed
the
thing
better
if
it
had
been
caught
off
guard
and
robbed
of
its
chance
the
young
girl
paid
no
attention
to
the
bow
but
put
out
her
hand
frankly
and
gave
the
stranger
a
friendly
shake
and
said
how
do
you
do
then
she
marched
to
the
one
washstand
in
the
room
tilted
her
head
this
way
and
that
before
the
wreck
of
a
cheap
mirror
that
hung
above
it
dampened
her
fingers
with
her
tongue
perfected
the
circle
of
a
little
lock
of
hair
that
was
pasted
against
her
forehead
then
began
to
busy
herself
with
the
slops
well
i
must
be
going
it
getting
towards
supper
time
make
yourself
at
home
tracy
you
hear
the
bell
when
it
the
landlady
took
her
tranquil
departure
without
commanding
either
of
the
young
people
to
vacate
the
room
the
young
man
wondered
a
little
that
a
mother
who
seemed
so
honest
and
respectable
should
be
so
thoughtless
and
was
reaching
for
his
hat
intending
to
disembarrass
the
girl
of
his
presence
but
she
said
where
are
you
going
well
nowhere
in
particular
but
as
i
am
only
in
the
way
here
why
who
said
you
were
in
the
way
sit
down
i
move
you
when
you
are
in
the
she
was
making
the
beds
now
he
sat
down
and
watched
her
deft
and
diligent
performance
what
gave
you
that
notion
do
you
reckon
i
need
a
whole
room
just
to
make
up
a
bed
or
two
in
well
no
it
was
that
exactly
we
are
away
up
here
in
an
empty
house
and
your
mother
being
gone
the
girl
interrupted
him
with
an
amused
laugh
and
said
nobody
to
protect
me
bless
you
i
do
need
it
i
not
afraid
i
might
be
if
i
was
alone
because
i
do
hate
ghosts
and
i
do
deny
it
not
that
i
believe
in
them
for
i
do
i
only
just
afraid
of
how
can
you
be
afraid
of
them
if
you
do
believe
in
them
oh
i
do
know
the
how
of
it
that
too
many
for
me
i
only
know
it
so
it
the
same
with
maggie
who
is
that
one
of
the
boarders
young
lady
that
works
in
the
she
works
in
a
factory
yes
shoe
in
a
shoe
factory
and
you
call
her
a
young
lady
why
she
only
what
should
you
call
her
i
was
thinking
of
her
age
i
was
thinking
of
the
title
the
fact
is
i
came
away
from
england
to
get
away
from
artificial
forms
for
artificial
forms
suit
artificial
people
only
and
here
you
got
them
too
i
sorry
i
hoped
you
had
only
men
and
women
everybody
equal
no
differences
in
the
girl
stopped
with
a
pillow
in
her
teeth
and
the
case
spread
open
below
it
contemplating
him
from
under
her
brows
with
a
slightly
puzzled
expression
she
released
the
pillow
and
said
why
they
are
all
equal
where
any
difference
in
rank
if
you
call
a
factory
girl
a
young
lady
what
do
you
call
the
president
wife
call
her
an
old
oh
you
make
age
the
only
distinction
there
ai
any
other
to
make
as
far
as
i
can
then
all
women
are
ladies
certainly
they
are
all
the
respectable
well
that
puts
a
better
face
on
it
certainly
there
is
no
harm
in
a
title
when
it
is
given
to
everybody
it
is
only
an
offense
and
a
wrong
when
it
is
restricted
to
a
favored
few
but
miss
er
miss
hattie
be
frank
confess
that
that
title
is
accorded
by
everybody
to
everybody
the
rich
american
does
call
her
cook
a
lady
is
that
so
yes
it
so
what
of
it
he
was
surprised
and
a
little
disappointed
to
see
that
his
admirable
shot
had
produced
no
perceptible
effect
what
of
it
he
said
why
this
equality
is
not
conceded
here
after
all
and
the
americans
are
no
better
off
than
the
english
in
fact
there
no
now
what
an
idea
there
nothing
in
a
title
except
what
is
put
into
it
you
said
that
yourself
suppose
the
title
is
instead
of
you
get
that
i
believe
so
instead
of
speaking
of
a
woman
as
a
lady
you
substitute
clean
and
say
she
a
clean
that
it
in
england
the
swell
folks
do
speak
of
the
working
people
as
gentlemen
and
ladies
oh
and
the
working
people
do
call
themselves
gentlemen
and
ladies
certainly
so
if
you
used
the
other
word
there
would
be
any
change
the
swell
people
would
call
anybody
but
themselves
and
those
others
would
drop
sort
of
meekly
into
their
way
of
talking
and
they
call
themselves
clean
we
do
do
that
way
here
everybody
calls
himself
a
lady
or
gentleman
and
thinks
he
is
and
do
care
what
anybody
else
thinks
him
so
long
as
he
do
say
it
out
loud
you
think
there
no
difference
you
knuckle
down
and
we
do
ai
that
a
difference
it
is
a
difference
i
had
thought
of
i
admit
that
still
calling
one
self
a
lady
does
er
i
would
go
on
if
i
were
howard
tracy
turned
his
head
to
see
who
it
might
be
that
had
introduced
this
remark
it
was
a
short
man
about
forty
years
old
with
sandy
hair
no
beard
and
a
pleasant
face
badly
freckled
but
alive
and
intelligent
and
he
wore
clothing
which
was
neat
but
showed
wear
he
had
come
from
the
front
room
beyond
the
hall
where
he
had
left
his
hat
and
he
had
a
chipped
and
cracked
white
in
his
hand
the
girl
came
and
took
the
bowl
i
get
it
for
you
you
go
right
ahead
and
give
it
to
him
barrow
he
the
new
boarder
tracy
and
i
just
got
to
where
it
was
getting
too
deep
for
much
obliged
if
you
will
hattie
i
was
coming
to
borrow
of
the
he
sat
down
at
his
ease
on
an
old
trunk
and
said
i
been
listening
and
got
interested
and
as
i
was
saying
i
would
go
on
if
i
were
you
you
see
where
you
are
coming
to
do
you
calling
yourself
a
lady
does
elect
you
that
is
what
you
were
going
to
say
and
you
saw
that
if
you
said
it
you
were
going
to
run
right
up
against
another
difference
that
you
had
thought
of
whose
right
is
it
to
do
the
electing
over
there
twenty
thousand
people
in
a
million
elect
themselves
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
the
nine
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
accept
that
decree
and
swallow
the
affront
which
it
puts
upon
them
why
if
they
did
accept
it
it
would
be
an
election
it
would
be
a
dead
letter
and
have
no
force
at
all
over
here
the
twenty
thousand
exclusives
come
up
to
the
polls
and
vote
themselves
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
the
thing
does
stop
there
the
nine
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
come
and
vote
themselves
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
too
and
that
elects
the
whole
nation
since
the
whole
million
vote
themselves
ladies
and
gentlemen
there
is
no
question
about
that
election
it
does
make
absolute
equality
and
there
is
no
fiction
about
it
while
over
yonder
the
inequality
by
decree
of
the
infinitely
feeble
and
consent
of
the
infinitely
strong
is
also
absolute
as
real
and
absolute
as
our
tracy
had
shrunk
promptly
into
his
english
shell
when
this
speech
began
notwithstanding
he
had
now
been
in
severe
training
several
weeks
for
contact
and
intercourse
with
the
common
herd
on
the
common
herd
terms
but
he
lost
no
time
in
pulling
himself
out
again
and
so
by
the
time
the
speech
was
finished
his
valves
were
open
once
more
and
he
was
forcing
himself
to
accept
without
resentment
the
common
herd
frank
fashion
of
dropping
sociably
into
other
people
conversations
unembarrassed
and
uninvited
the
process
was
not
very
difficult
this
time
for
the
smile
and
voice
and
manner
were
persuasive
and
winning
tracy
would
even
have
liked
him
on
the
spot
but
for
the
fact
fact
which
he
was
not
really
aware
of
that
the
equality
of
men
was
not
yet
a
reality
to
him
it
was
only
a
theory
the
mind
perceived
but
the
man
failed
to
feel
it
it
was
hattie
ghost
over
again
merely
turned
around
theoretically
barrow
was
his
equal
but
it
was
distinctly
distasteful
to
see
him
exhibit
it
he
presently
said
i
hope
in
all
sincerity
that
what
you
have
said
is
true
as
regards
the
americans
for
doubts
have
crept
into
my
mind
several
times
it
seemed
that
the
equality
must
be
ungenuine
where
the
of
castes
were
still
in
vogue
but
those
have
certainly
lost
their
offence
and
are
wholly
neutralized
nullified
and
harmless
if
they
are
the
undisputed
property
of
every
individual
in
the
nation
i
think
i
realize
that
caste
does
not
exist
and
can
not
exist
except
by
common
consent
of
the
masses
outside
of
its
limits
i
thought
caste
created
itself
and
perpetuated
itself
but
it
seems
quite
true
that
it
only
creates
itself
and
is
perpetuated
by
the
people
whom
it
despises
and
who
can
dissolve
it
at
any
time
by
assuming
its
mere
it
what
i
think
there
is
any
power
on
earth
that
can
prevent
england
thirty
millions
from
electing
themselves
dukes
and
duchesses
and
calling
themselves
so
and
within
six
months
all
the
former
dukes
and
duchesses
would
have
retired
from
the
business
i
wish
they
try
that
royalty
itself
could
survive
such
a
process
a
handful
of
frowners
against
thirty
million
laughers
in
a
state
of
irruption
why
it
herculaneum
against
vesuvius
it
would
take
another
eighteen
centuries
to
find
that
herculaneum
after
the
cataclysm
a
colonel
in
our
south
he
a
nobody
because
they
all
colonels
down
there
no
tracy
shudder
from
tracy
nobody
in
england
would
call
you
a
gentleman
and
you
would
call
yourself
one
and
i
tell
you
a
state
of
things
that
makes
a
man
put
himself
into
most
unbecoming
attitudes
sometimes
the
broad
and
general
recognition
and
acceptance
of
caste
as
caste
does
i
mean
makes
him
do
it
unconsciously
being
bred
in
him
you
see
and
never
thought
over
and
reasoned
out
you
conceive
of
the
matterhorn
being
flattered
by
the
notice
of
one
of
your
comely
little
english
hills
could
you
why
well
then
let
a
man
in
his
right
mind
try
to
conceive
of
darwin
feeling
flattered
by
the
notice
of
a
princess
it
so
grotesque
that
it
well
it
paralyzes
the
imagination
yet
that
memnon
was
flattered
by
the
notice
of
that
statuette
he
says
so
says
so
himself
the
system
that
can
make
a
god
disown
his
godship
and
profane
it
oh
well
all
wrong
it
all
wrong
and
ought
to
be
abolished
i
should
the
mention
of
darwin
brought
on
a
literary
discussion
and
this
topic
roused
such
enthusiasm
in
barrow
that
he
took
off
his
coat
and
made
himself
the
more
free
and
comfortable
for
it
and
detained
him
so
long
that
he
was
still
at
it
when
the
noisy
proprietors
of
the
room
came
shouting
and
skylarking
in
and
began
to
romp
scuffle
wash
and
otherwise
entertain
themselves
he
lingered
yet
a
little
longer
to
offer
the
hospitalities
of
his
room
and
his
book
shelf
to
tracy
and
ask
him
a
personal
question
or
two
what
is
your
trade
they
well
they
call
me
a
cowboy
but
that
is
a
fancy
i
not
that
i
have
any
what
do
you
work
at
for
your
living
oh
anything
i
mean
i
would
work
at
anything
i
could
get
to
do
but
thus
far
i
have
been
able
to
find
an
maybe
i
can
help
you
i
like
to
i
shall
be
very
glad
i
tried
myself
to
well
of
course
where
a
man
has
a
regular
trade
he
pretty
bad
off
in
this
world
what
you
needed
i
reckon
was
less
book
learning
and
more
learning
i
do
know
what
your
father
could
have
been
thinking
of
you
ought
to
have
had
a
trade
you
ought
to
have
had
a
trade
by
all
means
but
never
mind
about
that
we
stir
up
something
to
do
i
guess
and
do
you
get
homesick
that
a
bad
business
talk
the
thing
over
and
look
around
a
little
you
come
out
all
right
wait
for
me
i
go
down
to
supper
with
by
this
time
tracy
had
achieved
a
very
friendly
feeling
for
barrow
and
would
have
called
him
a
friend
maybe
if
not
taken
too
suddenly
on
a
requirement
to
realize
on
his
theories
he
was
glad
of
his
society
anyway
and
was
feeling
lighter
hearted
than
before
also
he
was
pretty
curious
to
know
what
vocation
it
might
be
which
had
furnished
barrow
such
a
large
acquaintanceship
with
books
and
allowed
him
so
much
time
to
read
chapter
xii
presently
the
supper
bell
began
to
ring
in
the
depths
of
the
house
and
the
sound
proceeded
steadily
upward
growing
in
intensity
all
the
way
up
towards
the
upper
floors
the
higher
it
came
the
more
maddening
was
the
noise
until
at
last
what
it
lacked
of
being
absolutely
deafening
was
made
up
of
the
sudden
crash
and
clatter
of
an
avalanche
of
boarders
down
the
uncarpeted
stairway
the
peerage
did
not
go
to
meals
in
this
fashion
tracy
training
had
not
fitted
him
to
enjoy
this
hilarious
zoological
clamor
and
enthusiasm
he
had
to
confess
that
there
was
something
about
this
extraordinary
outpouring
of
animal
spirits
which
he
would
have
to
get
inured
to
before
he
could
accept
it
no
doubt
in
time
he
would
prefer
it
but
he
wished
the
process
might
be
modified
and
made
just
a
little
more
gradual
and
not
quite
so
pronounced
and
violent
barrow
and
tracy
followed
the
avalanche
down
through
an
ever
increasing
and
ever
more
and
more
aggressive
stench
of
bygone
cabbage
and
kindred
smells
smells
which
are
to
be
found
nowhere
but
in
a
cheap
private
boarding
house
smells
which
once
encountered
can
never
be
forgotten
smells
which
encountered
generations
later
are
instantly
recognizable
but
never
recognizable
with
pleasure
to
tracy
these
odors
were
suffocating
horrible
almost
unendurable
but
he
held
his
peace
and
said
nothing
arrived
in
the
basement
they
entered
a
large
where
or
forty
people
sat
at
a
long
table
they
took
their
places
the
feast
had
already
begun
and
the
conversation
was
going
on
in
the
liveliest
way
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
the
table
cloth
was
of
very
coarse
material
and
was
liberally
spotted
with
coffee
stains
and
grease
the
knives
and
forks
were
iron
with
bone
handles
the
spoons
appeared
to
be
iron
or
sheet
iron
or
something
of
the
sort
the
tea
and
coffee
cups
were
of
the
commonest
and
heaviest
and
most
durable
stone
ware
all
the
furniture
of
the
table
was
of
the
commonest
and
cheapest
sort
there
was
a
single
large
thick
slice
of
bread
by
each
boarder
plate
and
it
was
observable
that
he
economized
it
as
if
he
were
not
expecting
it
to
be
duplicated
dishes
of
butter
were
distributed
along
the
table
within
reach
of
people
arms
if
they
had
long
ones
but
there
were
no
private
butter
plates
the
butter
was
perhaps
good
enough
and
was
quiet
and
well
behaved
but
it
had
more
bouquet
than
was
necessary
though
nobody
commented
upon
that
fact
or
seemed
in
any
way
disturbed
by
it
the
main
feature
of
the
feast
was
a
piping
hot
irish
stew
made
of
the
potatoes
and
meat
left
over
from
a
procession
of
previous
meals
everybody
was
liberally
supplied
with
this
dish
on
the
table
were
a
couple
of
great
dishes
of
sliced
ham
and
there
were
some
other
eatables
of
minor
importance
preserves
and
new
orleans
molasses
and
such
things
there
was
also
plenty
of
tea
and
coffee
of
an
infernal
sort
with
brown
sugar
and
condensed
milk
but
the
milk
and
sugar
supply
was
not
left
at
the
discretion
of
the
boarders
but
was
rationed
out
at
headquarters
one
spoonful
of
sugar
and
one
of
condensed
milk
to
each
cup
and
no
more
the
table
was
waited
upon
by
two
stalwart
negro
women
who
raced
back
and
forth
from
the
bases
of
supplies
with
splendid
dash
and
clatter
and
energy
their
labors
were
supplemented
after
a
fashion
by
the
young
girl
puss
she
carried
coffee
and
tea
back
and
forth
among
the
boarders
but
she
made
pleasure
excursions
rather
than
business
ones
in
this
way
to
speak
strictly
she
made
jokes
with
various
people
she
chaffed
the
young
men
pleasantly
and
wittily
as
she
supposed
and
as
the
rest
also
supposed
apparently
judging
by
the
applause
and
laughter
which
she
got
by
her
efforts
manifestly
she
was
a
favorite
with
most
of
the
young
fellows
and
sweetheart
of
the
rest
of
them
where
she
conferred
notice
she
conferred
happiness
as
was
seen
by
the
face
of
the
recipient
and
at
the
same
time
she
conferred
unhappiness
one
could
see
it
fall
and
dim
the
faces
of
the
other
young
fellows
like
a
shadow
she
never
mistered
these
friends
of
hers
but
called
them
billy
tom
john
and
they
called
her
puss
or
marsh
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
wife
sat
at
the
foot
marsh
was
a
man
of
sixty
and
was
an
american
but
if
he
had
been
born
a
month
earlier
he
would
have
been
a
spaniard
he
was
plenty
good
enough
spaniard
as
it
was
his
face
was
very
dark
his
hair
very
black
and
his
eyes
were
not
only
exceedingly
black
but
were
very
intense
and
there
was
something
about
them
that
indicated
that
they
could
burn
with
passion
upon
occasion
he
was
and
and
the
general
aspect
of
him
was
disagreeable
he
was
evidently
not
a
very
companionable
person
if
looks
went
for
anything
he
was
the
very
opposite
of
his
wife
who
was
all
motherliness
and
charity
good
will
and
good
nature
all
the
young
men
and
the
women
called
her
aunt
rachael
which
was
another
sign
tracy
wandering
and
interested
eye
presently
fell
upon
one
boarder
who
had
been
overlooked
in
the
distribution
of
the
stew
he
was
very
pale
and
looked
as
if
he
had
but
lately
come
out
of
a
sick
bed
and
also
as
if
he
ought
to
get
back
into
it
again
as
soon
as
possible
his
face
was
very
melancholy
the
waves
of
laughter
and
conversation
broke
upon
it
without
affecting
it
any
more
than
if
it
had
been
a
rock
in
the
sea
and
the
words
and
the
laughter
veritable
waters
he
held
his
head
down
and
looked
ashamed
some
of
the
women
cast
glances
of
pity
toward
him
from
time
to
time
in
a
furtive
and
half
afraid
way
and
some
of
the
youngest
of
the
men
plainly
had
compassion
on
the
young
fellow
a
compassion
exhibited
in
their
faces
but
not
in
any
more
active
or
compromising
way
but
the
great
majority
of
the
people
present
showed
entire
indifference
to
the
youth
and
his
sorrows
marsh
sat
with
his
head
down
but
one
could
catch
the
malicious
gleam
of
his
eyes
through
his
shaggy
brows
he
was
watching
that
young
fellow
with
evident
relish
he
had
not
neglected
him
through
carelessness
and
apparently
the
table
understood
that
fact
the
spectacle
was
making
marsh
very
uncomfortable
she
had
the
look
of
one
who
hopes
against
hope
that
the
impossible
may
happen
but
as
the
impossible
did
not
happen
she
finally
ventured
to
speak
up
and
remind
her
husband
that
nat
brady
had
been
helped
to
the
irish
stew
marsh
lifted
his
head
and
gasped
out
with
mock
courtliness
oh
he
has
has
he
what
a
pity
that
is
i
do
know
how
i
came
to
overlook
him
ah
he
must
pardon
me
you
must
indeed
mr
er
baxter
barker
you
must
pardon
me
i
er
my
attention
was
directed
to
some
other
matter
i
do
know
what
the
thing
that
grieves
me
mainly
is
that
it
happens
every
meal
now
but
you
must
try
to
overlook
these
little
things
bunker
these
little
neglects
on
my
part
they
always
likely
to
happen
with
me
in
any
case
and
they
are
especially
likely
to
happen
where
a
person
has
er
well
where
a
person
is
say
about
three
weeks
in
arrears
for
his
board
you
get
my
meaning
you
get
my
idea
here
is
your
irish
stew
and
er
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
send
it
to
you
and
i
hope
that
you
will
enjoy
the
charity
as
much
as
i
enjoy
conferring
a
blush
rose
in
brady
white
cheeks
and
flowed
slowly
backward
to
his
ears
and
upward
toward
his
forehead
but
he
said
nothing
and
began
to
eat
his
food
under
the
embarrassment
of
a
general
silence
and
the
sense
that
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
barrow
whispered
to
tracy
the
old
man
been
waiting
for
that
he
would
have
missed
that
chance
for
it
a
brutal
business
said
tracy
then
he
said
to
himself
purposing
to
set
the
thought
down
in
his
diary
later
well
here
in
this
very
house
is
a
republic
where
all
are
free
and
equal
if
men
are
free
and
equal
anywhere
in
the
earth
therefore
i
have
arrived
at
the
place
i
started
to
find
and
i
am
a
man
among
men
and
on
the
strictest
equality
possible
to
men
no
doubt
yet
here
on
the
threshold
i
find
an
inequality
there
are
people
at
this
table
who
are
looked
up
to
for
some
reason
or
another
and
here
is
a
poor
devil
of
a
boy
who
is
looked
down
upon
treated
with
indifference
and
shamed
by
humiliations
when
he
has
committed
no
crime
but
that
common
one
of
being
poor
equality
ought
to
make
men
in
fact
i
had
supposed
it
did
do
after
supper
barrow
proposed
a
walk
and
they
started
barrow
had
a
purpose
he
wanted
tracy
to
get
rid
of
that
cowboy
hat
he
did
see
his
way
to
finding
mechanical
or
manual
employment
for
a
person
rigged
in
that
fashion
barrow
presently
said
as
i
understand
it
you
not
a
no
i
well
now
if
you
will
not
think
me
too
curious
how
did
you
come
to
mount
that
hat
where
you
get
it
tracy
did
know
quite
how
to
reply
to
this
but
presently
said
well
without
going
into
particulars
i
exchanged
clothes
with
a
stranger
under
stress
of
weather
and
i
would
like
to
find
him
and
well
why
do
you
find
him
where
is
he
i
do
know
i
supposed
the
best
way
to
find
him
would
be
to
continue
to
wear
his
clothes
which
are
conspicuous
enough
to
attract
his
attention
if
i
should
meet
him
on
the
oh
very
well
said
barrow
the
rest
of
the
outfit
is
well
enough
and
while
it
not
too
conspicuous
it
is
quite
like
the
clothes
that
anybody
else
wears
suppress
the
hat
when
you
meet
your
man
recognize
the
rest
of
his
suit
that
a
mighty
embarrassing
hat
you
know
in
a
centre
of
civilization
like
this
i
do
believe
an
angel
could
get
employment
in
washington
in
a
halo
like
tracy
agreed
to
replace
the
hat
with
something
of
a
modester
form
and
they
stepped
aboard
a
crowded
car
and
stood
with
others
on
the
rear
platform
presently
as
the
car
moved
swiftly
along
the
rails
two
men
crossing
the
street
caught
sight
of
the
backs
of
barrow
and
tracy
and
both
exclaimed
at
once
there
he
is
it
was
sellers
and
hawkins
both
were
so
paralyzed
with
joy
that
before
they
could
pull
themselves
together
and
make
an
effort
to
stop
the
car
it
was
gone
too
far
and
they
decided
to
wait
for
the
next
one
they
waited
a
while
then
it
occurred
to
washington
that
there
could
be
no
use
in
chasing
one
with
another
and
he
wanted
to
hunt
up
a
hack
but
the
colonel
said
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
no
occasion
for
that
at
all
now
that
i
got
him
materialized
i
can
command
his
motions
i
have
him
at
the
house
by
the
time
we
get
then
they
hurried
off
home
in
a
state
of
great
and
joyful
excitement
the
hat
exchange
accomplished
the
two
new
friends
started
to
walk
back
leisurely
to
the
boarding
house
barrow
mind
was
full
of
curiosity
about
this
young
fellow
he
said
you
never
been
to
the
rocky
mountains
you
never
been
out
on
the
plains
how
long
have
you
been
in
this
country
only
a
few
you
never
been
in
america
before
then
barrow
communed
with
himself
now
what
odd
shapes
the
notions
of
romantic
people
take
here
a
young
fellow
who
read
in
england
about
cowboys
and
adventures
on
the
plains
he
comes
here
and
buys
a
cowboy
suit
thinks
he
can
play
himself
on
folks
for
a
cowboy
all
inexperienced
as
he
is
now
the
minute
he
caught
in
this
poor
little
game
he
ashamed
of
it
and
ready
to
retire
from
it
it
is
that
exchange
that
he
has
put
up
as
an
explanation
it
rather
thin
too
thin
altogether
well
he
young
never
been
anywhere
knows
nothing
about
the
world
sentimental
no
doubt
perhaps
it
was
the
natural
thing
for
him
to
do
but
it
was
a
most
singular
choice
curious
freak
both
men
were
busy
with
their
thoughts
for
a
time
then
tracy
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
mr
barrow
the
case
of
that
young
fellow
troubles
you
mean
nat
brady
yes
brady
or
baxter
or
whatever
it
was
the
old
landlord
called
him
by
several
different
oh
yes
he
has
been
very
liberal
with
names
for
brady
since
brady
fell
into
arrears
for
his
board
well
that
one
of
his
sarcasms
the
old
man
thinks
he
great
on
well
what
is
brady
difficulty
what
is
brady
who
is
he
brady
is
a
tinner
he
a
young
journeyman
tinner
who
was
getting
along
all
right
till
he
fell
sick
and
lost
his
job
he
was
very
popular
before
he
lost
his
job
everybody
in
the
house
liked
brady
the
old
man
was
rather
especially
fond
of
him
but
you
know
that
when
a
man
loses
his
job
and
loses
his
ability
to
support
himself
and
to
pay
his
way
as
he
goes
it
makes
a
great
difference
in
the
way
people
look
at
him
and
feel
about
is
that
so
is
it
so
barrow
looked
at
tracy
in
a
puzzled
way
why
of
course
it
so
would
you
know
that
naturally
do
you
know
that
the
wounded
deer
is
always
attacked
and
killed
by
its
companions
and
friends
tracy
said
to
himself
while
a
chilly
and
boding
discomfort
spread
itself
through
his
system
in
a
republic
of
deer
and
men
where
all
are
free
and
equal
misfortune
is
a
crime
and
the
prosperous
gore
the
unfortunate
to
then
he
said
aloud
here
in
the
boarding
house
if
one
would
have
friends
and
be
popular
instead
of
having
the
cold
shoulder
turned
upon
him
he
must
be
yes
barrow
said
that
is
so
it
their
human
nature
they
do
turn
against
brady
now
that
he
unfortunate
and
they
do
like
him
as
well
as
they
did
before
but
it
is
because
of
any
lack
in
brady
just
as
he
was
before
has
the
same
nature
and
the
same
impulses
but
they
well
brady
is
a
thorn
in
their
consciences
you
see
they
know
they
ought
to
help
him
and
they
too
stingy
to
do
it
and
ashamed
of
themselves
for
that
and
they
ought
also
to
hate
themselves
on
that
account
but
instead
of
that
they
hate
brady
because
he
makes
them
ashamed
of
themselves
i
say
that
human
nature
that
occurs
everywhere
this
boarding
house
is
merely
the
world
in
little
the
case
all
over
they
all
alike
in
prosperity
we
are
popular
popularity
comes
easy
in
that
case
but
when
the
other
thing
comes
our
friends
are
pretty
likely
to
turn
against
tracy
noble
theories
and
high
purposes
were
beginning
to
feel
pretty
damp
and
clammy
he
wondered
if
by
any
possibility
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
throwing
his
own
prosperity
to
the
winds
and
taking
up
the
cross
of
other
people
unprosperity
but
he
would
listen
to
that
sort
of
thing
he
cast
it
out
of
his
mind
and
resolved
to
go
ahead
resolutely
along
the
course
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
extracts
from
his
diary
have
now
spent
several
days
in
this
singular
hive
i
do
know
quite
what
to
make
out
of
these
people
they
have
merits
and
virtues
but
they
have
some
other
qualities
and
some
ways
that
are
hard
to
get
along
with
i
ca
enjoy
them
the
moment
i
appeared
in
a
hat
of
the
period
i
noticed
a
change
the
respect
which
had
been
paid
me
before
passed
suddenly
away
and
the
people
became
friendly
more
than
that
they
became
familiar
and
i
not
used
to
familiarity
and
ca
take
to
it
right
off
i
find
that
out
these
people
familiarity
amounts
to
impudence
sometimes
i
suppose
it
all
right
no
doubt
i
can
get
used
to
it
but
it
not
a
satisfactory
process
at
all
i
have
accomplished
my
dearest
wish
i
am
a
man
among
men
on
an
equal
footing
with
tom
dick
and
harry
and
yet
it
is
just
exactly
what
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
i
miss
home
am
obliged
to
say
i
am
homesick
another
thing
and
this
is
a
confession
a
reluctant
one
but
i
will
make
it
the
thing
i
miss
most
and
most
severely
is
the
respect
the
deference
with
which
i
was
treated
all
my
life
in
england
and
which
seems
to
be
somehow
necessary
to
me
i
get
along
very
well
without
the
luxury
and
the
wealth
and
the
sort
of
society
i
been
accustomed
to
but
i
do
miss
the
respect
and
ca
seem
to
get
reconciled
to
the
absence
of
it
there
is
respect
there
is
deference
here
but
it
does
fall
to
my
share
it
is
lavished
on
two
men
one
of
them
is
a
portly
man
of
middle
age
who
is
a
retired
plumber
everybody
is
pleased
to
have
that
notice
he
full
of
pomp
and
circumstance
and
self
complacency
and
bad
grammar
and
at
table
he
is
sir
oracle
and
when
he
opens
his
mouth
not
any
dog
in
the
kennel
barks
the
other
person
is
a
policeman
at
the
he
represents
the
government
the
deference
paid
to
these
two
men
is
not
so
very
far
short
of
that
paid
to
an
earl
in
england
though
the
method
of
it
differs
not
so
much
courtliness
but
the
deference
is
all
there
yes
and
there
is
obsequiousness
too
it
does
rather
look
as
if
in
a
republic
where
all
are
free
and
equal
prosperity
and
position
constitute
rank
chapter
xiii
the
days
drifted
by
and
they
grew
ever
more
dreary
for
efforts
to
find
work
for
tracy
were
unavailing
always
the
first
question
asked
was
what
union
do
you
belong
to
tracy
was
obliged
to
reply
that
he
did
belong
to
any
very
well
then
it
impossible
to
employ
you
my
men
would
stay
with
me
if
i
should
employ
a
or
or
whatever
the
phrase
was
finally
tracy
had
a
happy
thought
he
said
why
the
thing
for
me
to
do
of
course
is
to
join
a
yes
barrow
said
that
is
the
thing
for
you
to
do
if
you
if
i
can
is
it
difficult
well
yes
barrow
said
it
sometimes
difficult
in
fact
very
difficult
but
you
can
try
and
of
course
it
will
be
best
to
therefore
tracy
tried
but
he
did
not
succeed
he
was
refused
admission
with
a
good
deal
of
promptness
and
was
advised
to
go
back
home
where
he
belonged
not
come
here
taking
honest
men
bread
out
of
their
mouths
tracy
began
to
realize
that
the
situation
was
desperate
and
the
thought
made
him
cold
to
the
marrow
he
said
to
himself
so
there
is
an
aristocracy
of
position
here
and
an
aristocracy
of
prosperity
and
apparently
there
is
also
an
aristocracy
of
the
ins
as
opposed
to
the
outs
and
i
am
with
the
outs
so
the
ranks
grow
daily
here
plainly
there
are
all
kinds
of
castes
here
and
only
one
that
i
belong
to
the
but
he
could
even
smile
at
his
small
joke
although
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
he
had
a
rather
good
opinion
of
it
he
was
feeling
so
defeated
and
miserable
by
this
time
that
he
could
no
longer
look
with
philosophical
complacency
on
the
horseplay
of
the
young
fellows
in
the
upper
rooms
at
night
at
first
it
had
been
pleasant
to
see
them
unbend
and
have
a
good
time
after
having
so
well
earned
it
by
the
labors
of
the
day
but
now
it
all
rasped
upon
his
feelings
and
his
dignity
he
lost
patience
with
the
spectacle
when
they
were
feeling
good
they
shouted
they
scuffled
they
sang
songs
they
romped
about
the
place
like
cattle
and
they
generally
wound
up
with
a
pillow
fight
in
which
they
banged
each
other
over
the
head
and
threw
the
pillows
in
all
directions
and
every
now
and
then
he
got
a
buffet
himself
and
they
were
always
inviting
him
to
join
in
they
called
him
johnny
bull
and
invited
him
with
excessive
familiarity
to
take
a
hand
at
first
he
had
endured
all
this
with
good
nature
but
latterly
he
had
shown
by
his
manner
that
it
was
distinctly
distasteful
to
him
and
very
soon
he
saw
a
change
in
the
manner
of
these
young
people
toward
him
they
were
souring
on
him
as
they
would
have
expressed
it
in
their
language
he
had
never
been
what
might
be
called
popular
that
was
hardly
the
phrase
for
it
he
had
merely
been
liked
but
now
dislike
for
him
was
growing
his
case
was
not
helped
by
the
fact
that
he
was
out
of
luck
could
get
work
did
belong
to
a
union
and
could
gain
admission
to
one
he
got
a
good
many
slights
of
that
small
sort
that
you
ca
quite
put
your
finger
on
and
it
was
manifest
that
there
was
only
one
thing
which
protected
him
from
open
insult
and
that
was
his
muscle
these
young
people
had
seen
him
exercising
mornings
after
his
cold
sponge
bath
and
they
had
perceived
by
his
performance
and
the
build
of
his
body
that
he
was
athletic
and
also
versed
in
boxing
he
felt
pretty
naked
now
recognizing
that
he
was
shorn
of
all
respect
except
respect
for
his
fists
one
night
when
he
entered
his
room
he
found
about
a
dozen
of
the
young
fellows
there
carrying
on
a
very
lively
conversation
punctuated
with
the
talking
ceased
instantly
and
the
frank
affront
of
a
dead
silence
followed
he
said
good
evening
gentlemen
and
sat
down
there
was
no
response
he
flushed
to
the
temples
but
forced
himself
to
maintain
silence
he
sat
there
in
this
uncomfortable
stillness
some
time
then
got
up
and
went
out
the
moment
he
had
disappeared
he
heard
a
prodigious
shout
of
laughter
break
forth
he
saw
that
their
plain
purpose
had
been
to
insult
him
he
ascended
to
the
flat
roof
hoping
to
be
able
to
cool
down
his
spirit
there
and
get
back
his
tranquility
he
found
the
young
tinner
up
there
alone
and
brooding
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
they
were
pretty
fairly
matched
now
in
unpopularity
and
general
and
misery
and
they
had
no
trouble
in
meeting
upon
this
common
ground
with
advantage
and
something
of
comfort
to
both
but
tracy
movements
had
been
watched
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
tormentors
came
straggling
one
after
another
to
the
roof
where
they
began
to
stroll
up
and
down
in
an
apparently
purposeless
way
but
presently
they
fell
to
dropping
remarks
that
were
evidently
aimed
at
tracy
and
some
of
them
at
the
tinner
the
ringleader
of
this
little
mob
was
a
bully
and
amateur
named
allen
who
was
accustomed
to
lording
it
over
the
upper
floor
and
had
more
than
once
shown
a
disposition
to
make
trouble
with
tracy
now
there
was
an
occasional
and
hootings
and
whistlings
and
finally
the
diversion
of
an
exchange
of
connected
remarks
was
introduced
how
many
does
it
take
to
make
a
pair
well
two
generally
makes
a
pair
but
sometimes
there
ai
stuff
enough
in
them
to
make
a
whole
general
laugh
what
were
you
saying
about
the
english
a
while
ago
oh
nothing
the
english
are
all
right
only
i
what
was
it
you
said
about
them
oh
i
only
said
they
swallow
swallow
better
than
other
people
oh
yes
the
english
swallow
a
good
deal
better
than
other
what
is
it
they
swallow
best
oh
another
general
laugh
pretty
hard
to
make
fight
ai
it
no
taint
hard
to
make
ai
it
really
no
taint
hard
it
another
laugh
this
one
kind
of
spiritless
that
could
be
the
other
way
in
his
why
do
you
know
the
secret
of
his
birth
no
has
he
got
a
secret
of
his
birth
you
bet
he
what
is
it
his
father
was
a
allen
came
strolling
by
where
the
pair
were
sitting
stopped
and
said
to
the
tinner
how
are
you
off
for
friends
these
days
well
enough
got
a
good
many
well
as
many
as
i
a
friend
is
valuable
sometimes
as
a
protector
you
know
what
do
you
reckon
would
happen
if
i
was
to
snatch
your
cap
off
and
slap
you
in
the
face
with
it
please
do
trouble
me
allen
i
ai
doing
anything
to
you
answer
me
what
do
you
reckon
would
happen
well
i
do
tracy
spoke
up
with
a
good
deal
of
deliberation
and
said
do
trouble
the
young
fellow
i
can
tell
you
what
would
oh
you
can
can
you
boys
johnny
bull
can
tell
us
what
would
happen
if
i
was
to
snatch
this
chump
cap
off
and
slap
him
in
the
face
with
it
now
you
he
snatched
the
cap
and
struck
the
youth
in
the
face
and
before
he
could
inquire
what
was
going
to
happen
it
had
already
happened
and
he
was
warming
the
tin
with
the
broad
of
his
back
instantly
there
was
a
rush
and
shouts
of
a
ring
a
ring
make
a
ring
fair
play
all
round
johnny
grit
give
him
a
the
ring
was
quickly
chalked
on
the
tin
and
tracy
found
himself
as
eager
to
begin
as
he
could
have
been
if
his
antagonist
had
been
a
prince
instead
of
a
mechanic
at
bottom
he
was
a
little
surprised
at
this
because
although
his
theories
had
been
all
in
that
direction
for
some
time
he
was
not
prepared
to
find
himself
actually
eager
to
measure
strength
with
quite
so
common
a
man
as
this
ruffian
in
a
moment
all
the
windows
in
the
neighborhood
were
filled
with
people
and
the
roofs
also
the
men
squared
off
and
the
fight
began
but
allen
stood
no
chance
whatever
against
the
young
englishman
neither
in
muscle
nor
in
science
was
he
his
equal
he
measured
his
length
on
the
tin
time
and
again
in
fact
as
fast
as
he
could
get
up
he
went
down
again
and
the
applause
was
kept
up
in
liberal
fashion
from
all
the
neighborhood
around
finally
allen
had
to
be
helped
up
then
tracy
declined
to
punish
him
further
and
the
fight
was
at
an
end
allen
was
carried
off
by
some
of
his
friends
in
a
very
much
humbled
condition
his
face
black
and
blue
and
bleeding
and
tracy
was
at
once
surrounded
by
the
young
fellows
who
congratulated
him
and
told
him
that
he
had
done
the
whole
house
a
service
and
that
from
this
out
allen
would
be
a
little
more
particular
about
how
he
handled
slights
and
insults
and
maltreatment
around
amongst
the
boarders
tracy
was
a
hero
now
and
exceedingly
popular
perhaps
nobody
had
ever
been
quite
so
popular
on
that
upper
floor
before
but
if
being
discountenanced
by
these
young
fellows
had
been
hard
to
bear
their
lavish
commendations
and
approval
and
were
harder
still
to
endure
he
felt
degraded
but
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
analyze
the
reasons
why
too
closely
he
was
content
to
satisfy
himself
with
the
suggestion
that
he
looked
upon
himself
as
degraded
by
the
public
spectacle
which
he
had
made
of
himself
fighting
on
a
tin
roof
for
the
delectation
of
everybody
a
block
or
two
around
but
he
was
entirely
satisfied
with
that
explanation
of
it
once
he
went
a
little
too
far
and
wrote
in
his
diary
that
his
case
was
worse
than
that
of
the
prodigal
son
he
said
the
prodigal
son
merely
fed
swine
he
did
have
to
chum
with
them
but
he
struck
that
out
and
said
all
men
are
equal
i
will
not
disown
my
principles
these
men
are
as
good
as
i
tracy
was
become
popular
on
the
lower
floors
also
everybody
was
grateful
for
allen
reduction
to
the
ranks
and
for
his
transformation
from
a
doer
of
outrages
to
a
mere
threatener
of
them
the
young
girls
of
whom
there
were
half
a
dozen
showed
many
attentions
to
tracy
particularly
that
boarding
house
pet
hattie
the
landlady
daughter
she
said
to
him
very
sweetly
i
think
you
ever
so
and
when
he
said
i
glad
you
think
so
miss
hattie
she
said
still
more
sweetly
do
call
me
miss
hattie
call
me
ah
here
was
promotion
he
had
struck
the
summit
there
were
no
higher
heights
to
climb
in
that
boarding
house
his
popularity
was
complete
in
the
presence
of
people
tracy
showed
a
tranquil
outside
but
his
heart
was
being
eaten
out
of
him
by
distress
and
despair
in
a
little
while
he
should
be
out
of
money
and
then
what
should
he
do
he
wished
now
that
he
had
borrowed
a
little
more
liberally
from
that
stranger
store
he
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
a
single
torturing
terrifying
thought
went
racking
round
and
round
in
his
head
wearing
a
groove
in
his
brain
what
should
he
do
what
was
to
become
of
him
and
along
with
it
began
to
intrude
a
something
presently
which
was
very
like
a
wish
that
he
had
not
joined
the
great
and
noble
ranks
of
martyrdom
but
had
stayed
at
home
and
been
content
to
be
merely
an
earl
and
nothing
better
with
nothing
more
to
do
in
this
world
of
a
useful
sort
than
an
earl
finds
to
do
but
he
smothered
that
part
of
his
thought
as
well
as
he
could
he
made
every
effort
to
drive
it
away
and
with
fair
success
but
he
could
keep
it
from
intruding
a
little
now
and
then
and
when
it
intruded
it
came
suddenly
and
nipped
him
like
a
bite
a
sting
a
burn
he
recognized
that
thought
by
the
peculiar
sharpness
of
its
pang
the
others
were
painful
enough
but
that
one
cut
to
the
quick
when
it
came
night
after
night
he
lay
tossing
to
the
music
of
the
hideous
snoring
of
the
honest
until
two
and
three
in
the
morning
then
got
up
and
took
refuge
on
the
roof
where
he
sometimes
got
a
nap
and
sometimes
failed
entirely
his
appetite
was
leaving
him
and
the
zest
of
life
was
going
along
with
it
finally
one
day
being
near
the
imminent
verge
of
total
discouragement
he
said
to
himself
and
took
occasion
to
blush
privately
when
he
said
it
if
my
father
knew
what
my
american
name
is
he
well
my
duty
to
my
father
rather
requires
that
i
furnish
him
my
name
i
have
no
right
to
make
his
days
and
nights
unhappy
i
can
do
enough
unhappiness
for
the
family
all
by
myself
really
he
ought
to
know
what
my
american
name
he
thought
over
it
a
while
and
framed
a
cablegram
in
his
mind
to
this
effect
my
american
name
is
howard
that
would
be
suggesting
anything
his
father
could
understand
that
as
he
chose
and
doubtless
he
would
understand
it
as
it
was
meant
as
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
desire
on
the
part
of
a
son
to
make
his
old
father
happy
for
a
moment
continuing
his
train
of
thought
tracy
said
to
himself
ah
but
if
he
should
cable
me
to
come
home
i
i
do
that
i
must
do
that
i
started
out
on
a
mission
and
i
must
turn
my
back
on
it
in
cowardice
no
no
i
could
go
home
at
at
least
i
should
want
to
go
after
a
reflective
pause
well
maybe
perhaps
it
would
be
my
duty
to
go
in
the
circumstances
he
very
old
and
he
does
need
me
by
him
to
stay
his
footsteps
down
the
long
hill
that
inclines
westward
toward
the
sunset
of
his
life
well
i
think
about
that
yes
of
course
it
would
be
right
to
stay
here
if
i
well
perhaps
i
could
just
drop
him
a
line
and
put
it
off
a
little
while
and
satisfy
him
in
that
way
it
would
be
well
it
would
mar
everything
to
have
him
require
me
to
come
another
reflective
pause
then
and
yet
if
he
should
do
that
i
do
know
but
oh
dear
me
home
how
good
it
sounds
and
a
body
is
excusable
for
wanting
to
see
his
home
again
now
and
then
he
went
to
one
of
the
telegraph
offices
in
the
avenue
and
got
the
first
end
of
what
barrow
called
the
usual
washington
courtesy
where
they
treat
you
as
a
tramp
until
they
find
out
you
a
congressman
and
then
they
slobber
all
over
there
was
a
boy
of
seventeen
on
duty
there
tying
his
shoe
he
had
his
foot
on
a
chair
and
his
back
turned
toward
the
wicket
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
took
tracy
measure
turned
back
and
went
on
tying
his
shoe
tracy
finished
writing
his
telegram
and
waited
still
waited
and
still
waited
for
that
performance
to
finish
but
there
did
seem
to
be
any
finish
to
it
so
finally
tracy
said
ca
you
take
my
telegram
the
youth
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
said
by
his
manner
not
his
words
do
you
think
you
could
wait
a
minute
if
you
tried
however
he
got
the
shoe
tied
at
last
and
came
and
took
the
telegram
glanced
over
it
then
looked
up
surprised
at
tracy
there
was
something
in
his
look
that
bordered
upon
respect
almost
reverence
it
seemed
to
tracy
although
he
had
been
so
long
without
anything
of
this
kind
he
was
not
sure
that
he
knew
the
signs
of
it
the
boy
read
the
address
aloud
with
pleased
expression
in
face
and
voice
the
earl
of
rossmore
cracky
do
you
know
him
is
that
so
does
he
know
you
well
well
i
swear
will
he
answer
you
i
think
he
will
he
though
where
you
have
it
sent
oh
nowhere
i
call
here
and
get
it
when
shall
i
call
oh
i
do
know
i
send
it
to
you
where
shall
i
send
it
give
me
your
address
i
send
it
to
you
soon
it
but
tracy
did
propose
to
do
this
he
had
acquired
the
admiration
and
deferential
respect
and
he
was
willing
to
throw
these
precious
things
away
a
result
sure
to
follow
if
he
should
give
the
address
of
that
boarding
house
so
he
said
again
that
he
would
call
and
get
the
telegram
and
went
his
way
he
idled
along
reflecting
he
said
to
himself
there
is
something
pleasant
about
being
respected
i
have
acquired
the
respect
of
allen
and
some
of
those
others
and
almost
the
deference
of
some
of
them
on
pure
merit
for
having
thrashed
allen
while
their
respect
and
their
deference
if
it
is
deference
is
pleasant
a
deference
based
upon
a
sham
a
shadow
does
really
seem
pleasanter
still
it
no
real
merit
to
be
in
correspondence
with
an
earl
and
yet
after
all
that
boy
makes
me
feel
as
if
there
the
cablegram
was
actually
gone
home
the
thought
of
it
gave
him
an
immense
uplift
he
walked
with
a
lighter
tread
his
heart
was
full
of
happiness
he
threw
aside
all
hesitances
and
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
glad
through
and
through
that
he
was
going
to
give
up
this
experiment
and
go
back
to
his
home
again
his
eagerness
to
get
his
father
answer
began
to
grow
now
and
it
grew
with
marvelous
celerity
after
it
began
he
waited
an
hour
walking
about
putting
in
his
time
as
well
as
he
could
but
interested
in
nothing
that
came
under
his
eye
and
at
last
he
presented
himself
at
the
office
again
and
asked
if
any
answer
had
come
yet
the
boy
said
no
no
answer
yet
then
glanced
at
the
clock
and
added
i
do
think
it
likely
you
get
one
why
not
well
you
see
it
getting
pretty
late
you
ca
always
tell
where
a
man
is
when
he
on
the
other
side
and
you
ca
always
find
him
just
the
minute
you
want
him
and
you
see
it
getting
about
six
now
and
over
there
it
pretty
late
at
why
yes
said
tracy
i
had
thought
of
yes
pretty
late
now
half
past
ten
or
eleven
oh
yes
you
probably
wo
get
any
answer
chapter
xiv
so
tracy
went
home
to
supper
the
odors
in
that
supper
room
seemed
more
strenuous
and
more
horrible
than
ever
before
and
he
was
happy
in
the
thought
that
he
was
so
soon
to
be
free
from
them
again
when
the
supper
was
over
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
had
eaten
any
of
it
or
not
and
he
certainly
had
heard
any
of
the
conversation
his
heart
had
been
dancing
all
the
time
his
thoughts
had
been
faraway
from
these
things
and
in
the
visions
of
his
mind
the
sumptuous
appointments
of
his
father
castle
had
risen
before
him
without
rebuke
even
the
plushed
flunkey
that
walking
symbol
of
a
sham
inequality
had
not
been
unpleasant
to
his
dreaming
view
after
the
meal
barrow
said
come
with
me
i
give
you
a
jolly
very
good
where
are
you
going
to
my
what
club
is
that
mechanics
debating
tracy
shuddered
slightly
he
did
say
anything
about
having
visited
that
place
himself
somehow
he
did
quite
relish
the
memory
of
that
time
the
sentiments
which
had
made
his
former
visit
there
so
enjoyable
and
filled
him
with
such
enthusiasm
had
undergone
a
gradual
change
and
they
had
rotted
away
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
contemplate
another
visit
there
with
anything
strongly
resembling
delight
in
fact
he
was
a
little
ashamed
to
go
he
did
want
to
go
there
and
find
out
by
the
rude
impact
of
the
thought
of
those
people
upon
his
reorganized
condition
of
mind
how
sharp
the
change
had
been
he
would
have
preferred
to
stay
away
he
expected
that
now
he
should
hear
nothing
except
sentiments
which
would
be
a
reproach
to
him
in
his
changed
mental
attitude
and
he
rather
wished
he
might
be
excused
and
yet
he
quite
want
to
say
that
he
did
want
to
show
how
he
did
feel
or
show
any
disinclination
to
go
and
so
he
forced
himself
to
go
along
with
barrow
privately
purposing
to
take
an
early
opportunity
to
get
away
after
the
essayist
of
the
evening
had
read
his
paper
the
chairman
announced
that
the
debate
would
now
be
upon
the
subject
of
the
previous
meeting
the
american
it
saddened
the
backsliding
disciple
to
hear
this
announcement
it
brought
up
too
many
reminiscences
he
wished
he
had
happened
upon
some
other
subject
but
the
debate
began
and
he
sat
still
and
listened
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
one
of
the
speakers
a
blacksmith
named
tompkins
arraigned
all
monarchs
and
all
lords
in
the
earth
for
their
cold
selfishness
in
retaining
their
unearned
dignities
he
said
that
no
monarch
and
no
son
of
a
monarch
no
lord
and
no
son
of
a
lord
ought
to
be
able
to
look
his
fellow
man
in
the
face
without
shame
shame
for
consenting
to
keep
his
unearned
titles
property
and
privileges
at
the
expense
of
other
people
shame
for
consenting
to
remain
on
any
terms
in
dishonourable
possession
of
these
things
which
represented
bygone
robberies
and
wrongs
inflicted
upon
the
general
people
of
the
nation
he
said
if
there
were
a
lord
or
the
son
of
a
lord
here
i
would
like
to
reason
with
him
and
try
to
show
him
how
unfair
and
how
selfish
his
position
is
i
would
try
to
persuade
him
to
relinquish
it
take
his
place
among
men
on
equal
terms
earn
the
bread
he
eats
and
hold
of
slight
value
all
deference
paid
him
because
of
artificial
position
all
reverence
not
the
just
due
of
his
own
personal
tracy
seemed
to
be
listening
to
utterances
of
his
own
made
in
talks
with
his
radical
friends
in
england
it
was
as
if
some
eavesdropping
phonograph
had
treasured
up
his
words
and
brought
them
across
the
atlantic
to
accuse
him
with
them
in
the
hour
of
his
defection
and
retreat
every
word
spoken
by
this
stranger
seemed
to
leave
a
blister
on
tracy
conscience
and
by
the
time
the
speech
was
finished
he
felt
that
he
was
all
conscience
and
one
blister
this
man
deep
compassion
for
the
enslaved
and
oppressed
millions
in
europe
who
had
to
bear
with
the
contempt
of
that
small
class
above
them
throned
upon
shining
heights
whose
paths
were
shut
against
them
was
the
very
thing
he
had
often
uttered
himself
the
pity
in
this
man
voice
and
words
was
the
very
twin
of
the
pity
that
used
to
reside
in
his
own
heart
and
come
from
his
own
lips
when
he
thought
of
these
oppressed
peoples
the
homeward
tramp
was
accomplished
in
brooding
silence
it
was
a
silence
most
grateful
to
tracy
feelings
he
would
have
broken
it
for
anything
for
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
all
the
way
through
to
his
spine
he
kept
saying
to
himself
how
unanswerable
it
all
is
how
absolutely
unanswerable
it
is
basely
degradingly
selfish
to
keep
those
unearned
honors
and
and
oh
hang
it
nobody
but
a
cur
what
an
idiotic
damned
speech
that
tompkins
made
this
outburst
was
from
barrow
it
flooded
tracy
demoralized
soul
with
waters
of
refreshment
these
were
the
darlingest
words
the
poor
vacillating
young
apostate
had
ever
heard
for
they
whitewashed
his
shame
for
him
and
that
is
a
good
service
to
have
when
you
ca
get
the
best
of
all
verdicts
come
up
to
my
room
and
smoke
a
pipe
tracy
had
been
expecting
this
invitation
and
had
had
his
declination
all
ready
but
he
was
glad
enough
to
accept
now
was
it
possible
that
a
reasonable
argument
could
be
made
against
that
man
desolating
speech
he
was
burning
to
hear
barrow
try
it
he
knew
how
to
start
him
and
keep
him
going
it
was
to
seem
to
combat
his
positions
a
process
effective
with
most
people
what
is
it
you
object
to
in
tompkins
speech
barrow
oh
the
leaving
out
of
the
factor
of
human
nature
requiring
another
man
to
do
what
you
would
do
do
you
mean
why
here
what
i
mean
it
very
simple
tompkins
is
a
blacksmith
has
a
family
works
for
wages
and
hard
too
fooling
around
wo
furnish
the
bread
suppose
it
should
turn
out
that
by
the
death
of
somebody
in
england
he
is
suddenly
an
earl
income
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
what
would
he
do
well
i
i
suppose
he
would
have
to
decline
to
man
he
would
grab
it
in
a
second
do
you
really
think
he
would
think
i
do
think
anything
about
it
i
know
why
why
because
he
not
a
so
you
think
that
if
he
were
a
fool
he
no
i
do
fool
or
no
fool
he
would
grab
it
anybody
would
anybody
that
alive
and
i
seen
dead
people
that
would
get
up
and
go
for
it
i
would
this
was
balm
this
was
healing
this
was
rest
and
peace
and
comfort
but
i
thought
you
were
opposed
to
transmissible
ones
yes
but
that
nothing
i
opposed
to
millionaires
but
it
would
be
dangerous
to
offer
me
the
you
take
it
i
would
leave
the
funeral
of
my
dearest
enemy
to
go
and
assume
its
burdens
and
tracy
thought
a
while
then
said
i
do
know
that
i
quite
get
the
bearings
of
your
position
you
say
you
are
opposed
to
hereditary
nobilities
and
yet
if
you
had
the
chance
you
would
take
one
in
a
minute
i
would
and
there
is
a
mechanic
in
that
entire
club
that
would
there
is
a
lawyer
doctor
editor
author
tinker
loafer
railroad
president
saint
land
there
is
a
human
being
in
the
united
states
that
would
jump
at
the
chance
except
me
said
tracy
softly
except
you
barrow
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
his
scorn
so
choked
him
and
he
could
get
any
further
than
that
form
of
words
it
seemed
to
dam
his
flow
utterly
he
got
up
and
came
and
glared
upon
tracy
in
a
kind
of
outraged
and
unappeasable
way
and
said
again
except
you
he
walked
around
him
inspecting
him
from
one
point
of
view
and
then
another
and
relieving
his
soul
now
and
then
by
exploding
that
formula
at
him
except
you
finally
he
slumped
down
into
his
chair
with
the
air
of
one
who
gives
it
up
and
said
he
straining
his
viscera
and
he
breaking
his
heart
trying
to
get
some
job
that
a
good
dog
would
have
and
yet
wants
to
let
on
that
if
he
had
a
chance
to
scoop
an
earldom
he
would
do
it
tracy
do
put
this
kind
of
a
strain
on
me
lately
i
not
as
strong
as
i
well
i
was
meaning
to
put
a
strain
on
you
barrow
i
was
only
meaning
to
intimate
that
if
an
earldom
ever
does
fall
in
my
way
there
i
would
give
myself
any
worry
about
that
if
i
was
you
and
besides
i
can
settle
what
you
would
do
are
you
any
different
from
me
well
are
you
any
better
than
me
o
er
why
certainly
are
you
as
good
come
indeed
i
the
fact
is
you
take
me
so
suddenly
suddenly
what
is
there
sudden
about
it
it
is
a
difficult
question
is
it
or
doubtful
just
measure
us
on
the
only
fair
lines
the
lines
of
merit
and
of
course
you
admit
that
a
journeyman
chairmaker
that
earns
his
twenty
dollars
a
week
and
has
had
the
good
and
genuine
culture
of
contact
with
men
and
care
and
hardship
and
failure
and
success
and
downs
and
ups
and
ups
and
downs
is
just
a
trifle
the
superior
of
a
young
fellow
like
you
who
does
know
how
to
do
anything
that
valuable
ca
earn
his
living
in
any
secure
and
steady
way
has
had
any
experience
of
life
and
its
seriousness
has
any
culture
but
the
artificial
culture
of
books
which
adorns
but
really
educate
come
if
i
would
scorn
an
earldom
what
the
devil
right
have
you
to
do
it
tracy
dissembled
his
joy
though
he
wanted
to
thank
the
for
that
last
remark
presently
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
spoke
up
briskly
and
said
but
look
here
i
really
ca
quite
get
the
hang
of
your
notions
your
principles
if
they
are
principles
you
are
inconsistent
you
are
opposed
to
aristocracies
yet
you
take
an
earldom
if
you
could
am
i
to
understand
that
you
do
blame
an
earl
for
being
and
remaining
an
earl
i
certainly
and
you
would
blame
tompkins
or
yourself
or
me
or
anybody
for
accepting
an
earldom
if
it
was
offered
indeed
i
well
then
whom
would
you
blame
the
whole
nation
any
bulk
and
mass
of
population
anywhere
in
any
country
that
will
put
up
with
the
infamy
the
outrage
the
insult
of
a
hereditary
aristocracy
which
they
ca
enter
and
on
absolutely
free
and
equal
come
are
you
beclouding
yourself
with
distinctions
that
are
not
differences
indeed
i
am
not
i
am
entirely
about
this
thing
if
i
could
extirpate
an
aristocratic
system
by
declining
its
honors
then
i
should
be
a
rascal
to
accept
them
and
if
enough
of
the
mass
would
join
me
to
make
the
extirpation
possible
then
i
should
be
a
rascal
to
do
otherwise
than
help
in
the
i
believe
i
understand
yes
i
think
i
get
the
idea
you
have
no
blame
for
the
lucky
few
who
naturally
decline
to
vacate
the
pleasant
nest
they
were
born
into
you
only
despise
the
and
stupid
mass
of
the
nation
for
allowing
the
nest
to
that
it
that
it
you
can
get
a
simple
thing
through
your
head
if
you
work
at
it
long
do
mention
it
and
i
give
you
some
sound
advice
when
you
go
back
if
you
find
your
nation
up
and
ready
to
abolish
that
hoary
affront
lend
a
hand
but
if
that
is
the
state
of
things
and
you
get
a
chance
at
an
earldom
do
you
be
a
fool
you
take
tracy
responded
with
earnestness
and
enthusiasm
as
i
live
i
do
it
barrow
laughed
i
never
saw
such
a
fellow
i
begin
to
think
you
got
a
good
deal
of
imagination
with
you
the
idlest
fancy
freezes
into
a
reality
at
a
breath
why
you
looked
then
as
if
it
would
astonish
you
if
you
did
tumble
into
an
tracy
blushed
barrow
added
earldom
oh
yes
take
it
if
it
offers
but
meantime
we
go
on
looking
around
in
a
modest
way
and
if
you
get
a
chance
to
superintend
a
at
six
or
eight
dollars
a
week
you
just
trade
off
the
earldom
for
a
last
year
almanac
and
stick
to
the
chapter
xv
tracy
went
to
bed
happy
once
more
at
rest
in
his
mind
once
more
he
had
started
out
on
a
high
emprise
that
was
to
his
credit
he
argued
he
had
fought
the
best
fight
he
could
considering
the
odds
against
him
that
was
to
his
credit
he
had
been
defeated
certainly
there
was
nothing
discreditable
in
that
being
defeated
he
had
a
right
to
retire
with
the
honors
of
war
and
go
back
without
prejudice
to
the
position
in
the
world
society
to
which
he
had
been
born
why
not
even
the
rabid
republican
would
do
that
yes
his
conscience
was
comfortable
once
more
he
woke
refreshed
happy
and
eager
for
his
cablegram
he
had
been
born
an
aristocrat
he
had
been
a
democrat
for
a
time
he
was
now
an
aristocrat
again
he
marveled
to
find
that
this
final
change
was
not
merely
intellectual
it
had
invaded
his
feeling
and
he
also
marveled
to
note
that
this
feeling
seemed
a
good
deal
less
artificial
than
any
he
had
entertained
in
his
system
for
a
long
time
he
could
also
have
noted
if
he
had
thought
of
it
that
his
bearing
had
stiffened
over
night
and
that
his
chin
had
lifted
itself
a
shade
arrived
in
the
basement
he
was
about
to
enter
the
breakfast
room
when
he
saw
old
marsh
in
the
dim
light
of
a
corner
of
the
hall
beckoning
him
with
his
finger
to
approach
the
blood
welled
slowly
up
in
tracy
cheek
and
he
said
with
a
grade
of
injured
dignity
almost
ducal
is
that
for
me
what
is
the
purpose
of
it
i
want
to
speak
to
you
in
this
spot
is
private
enough
for
marsh
was
surprised
and
not
particularly
pleased
he
approached
and
said
oh
in
public
then
if
you
prefer
though
it
has
been
my
the
boarders
gathered
to
the
spot
interested
speak
out
said
tracy
what
is
it
you
want
well
have
you
er
forgot
something
i
i
not
aware
of
oh
you
not
now
you
stop
and
think
a
i
refuse
to
stop
and
think
it
does
interest
me
if
it
interests
you
speak
well
then
said
marsh
raising
his
voice
to
a
slightly
angry
pitch
you
forgot
to
pay
your
board
yesterday
if
you
bound
to
have
it
oh
yes
this
heir
to
an
annual
million
or
so
had
been
dreaming
and
soaring
and
had
forgotten
that
pitiful
three
or
four
dollars
for
penalty
he
must
have
it
coarsely
flung
in
his
face
in
the
presence
of
these
people
people
in
whose
countenances
was
already
beginning
to
dawn
an
uncharitable
enjoyment
of
the
situation
is
that
all
take
your
money
and
give
your
terrors
a
tracy
hand
went
down
into
his
pocket
with
angry
decision
but
it
did
come
out
the
color
began
to
ebb
out
of
his
face
the
countenances
about
him
showed
a
growing
interest
and
some
of
them
a
heightened
satisfaction
there
was
an
uncomfortable
pause
then
he
forced
out
with
difficulty
the
words
i
been
robbed
old
marsh
eyes
flamed
up
with
spanish
fire
and
he
exclaimed

caught
out
with
the
surprise

so
immense

extravagant
that
he
could

breath

the
crowd

back
at
the
sublimity
of
the
young
then
they
burst
into
a
laugh
that
made
the
windows
rattle
tracy

too
angry
to
realize
that
he
had
done
a
foolish
thing
he
said

this
fellow
an
earl
take
off
your
hat
pull
down
your
vest

he
come
off
and
forgot
his
crown
that
he
wears
sundays
cabled
over
to
his
pappy
to
send
you
step
out
and
get
that
cablegram
barrow
his
majesty
a
little
lame
oh
stop
cried
barrow
give
the
man
a
he
turned
and
said
with
some
severity
tracy
what
the
matter
with
you
what
kind
of
foolishness
is
this
you
been
talking
you
ought
to
have
more
i
not
been
talking
foolishness
and
if
you
go
to
the
telegraph
office
oh
do
talk
so
i
your
friend
in
trouble
and
out
of
it
before
your
face
and
behind
your
back
for
anything
in
reason
but
you
lost
your
head
you
see
and
this
moonshine
about
a
cablegram
i
go
there
and
ask
for
it
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
brady
here
i
give
you
a
written
order
for
it
fly
now
and
fetch
it
we
soon
see
brady
flew
immediately
the
sort
of
quiet
began
to
steal
over
the
crowd
which
means
dawning
doubt
misgiving
and
might
be
translated
into
the
words
maybe
he
is
expecting
a
cablegram
maybe
he
has
got
a
father
somewhere
maybe
we
been
just
a
little
too
fresh
just
a
shade
too
loud
talk
ceased
then
the
mutterings
and
low
murmurings
and
whisperings
died
out
the
crowd
began
to
crumble
apart
by
ones
and
twos
the
fragments
drifted
to
the
breakfast
table
barrow
tried
to
bring
tracy
in
but
he
said
not
yet
barrow
marsh
and
hattie
tried
offering
gentle
and
kindly
persuasions
but
he
said
i
would
rather
wait
till
he
even
old
marsh
began
to
have
suspicions
that
maybe
he
had
been
a
trifle
too
brash
as
he
called
it
in
the
privacy
of
his
soul
and
he
pulled
himself
together
and
started
toward
tracy
with
invitation
in
his
eyes
but
tracy
warned
him
off
with
a
gesture
which
was
quite
positive
and
eloquent
then
followed
the
stillest
quarter
of
an
hour
which
had
ever
been
known
in
that
house
at
that
time
of
day
it
was
so
still
and
so
solemn
withal
that
when
somebody
cup
slipped
from
his
fingers
and
landed
in
his
plate
the
shock
made
people
start
and
the
sharp
sound
seemed
as
indecorous
there
and
as
out
of
place
as
if
a
coffin
and
mourners
were
imminent
and
being
waited
for
and
at
last
when
feet
came
clattering
down
the
stairs
the
sacrilege
seemed
unbearable
everybody
rose
softly
and
turned
toward
the
door
where
stood
tracy
then
with
a
common
impulse
moved
a
step
or
two
in
that
direction
and
stopped
while
they
gazed
young
brady
arrived
panting
and
put
into
tracy
hand
sure
enough
an
envelope
tracy
fastened
a
bland
victorious
eye
upon
the
gazers
and
kept
it
there
till
one
by
one
they
dropped
their
eyes
vanquished
and
embarrassed
then
he
tore
open
the
telegram
and
glanced
at
its
message
the
yellow
paper
fell
from
his
fingers
and
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
his
face
turned
white
there
was
nothing
there
but
one
word
the
humorist
of
the
house
the
tall
billy
nash
caulker
from
the
navy
yard
was
standing
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
in
the
midst
of
the
pathetic
silence
that
was
now
brooding
over
the
place
and
moving
some
few
hearts
there
toward
compassion
he
began
to
whimper
then
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
and
buried
his
face
in
the
neck
of
the
bashfulest
young
fellow
in
the
company
a
blacksmith
shrieked
oh
pappy
how
could
you
and
began
to
bawl
like
a
teething
baby
if
one
may
imagine
a
baby
with
the
energy
and
the
devastating
voice
of
a
jackass
so
perfect
was
that
imitation
of
a
child
cry
and
so
vast
the
scale
of
it
and
so
ridiculous
the
aspect
of
the
performer
that
all
gravity
was
swept
from
the
place
as
if
by
a
hurricane
and
almost
everybody
there
joined
in
the
crash
of
laughter
provoked
by
the
exhibition
then
the
small
mob
began
to
take
its
revenge
revenge
for
the
discomfort
and
apprehension
it
had
brought
upon
itself
by
its
own
too
rash
freshness
of
a
little
while
before
it
guyed
its
poor
victim
baited
him
worried
him
as
dogs
do
with
a
cornered
cat
the
victim
answered
back
with
defiances
and
challenges
which
included
everybody
and
which
only
gave
the
sport
new
spirit
and
variety
but
when
he
changed
his
tactics
and
began
to
single
out
individuals
and
invite
them
by
name
the
fun
lost
its
funniness
and
the
interest
of
the
show
died
out
along
with
the
noise
finally
marsh
was
about
to
take
an
innings
but
barrow
said
never
mind
now
leave
him
alone
you
no
account
with
him
but
a
money
account
i
take
care
of
that
the
distressed
and
worried
landlady
gave
barrow
a
fervently
grateful
look
for
his
championship
of
the
abused
stranger
and
the
pet
of
the
house
a
very
prism
in
her
cheap
but
ravishing
sunday
rig
blew
him
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
said
with
the
darlingest
smile
and
a
sweet
little
toss
of
her
head
you
the
only
man
here
and
i
going
to
set
my
cap
for
you
you
dear
old
thing
for
shame
puss
how
you
talk
i
never
saw
such
a
child
it
took
a
good
deal
of
argument
and
persuasion
that
is
to
say
petting
under
these
disguises
to
get
tracy
to
entertain
the
idea
of
breakfast
he
at
first
said
he
would
never
eat
again
in
that
house
and
added
that
he
had
enough
firmness
of
character
he
trusted
to
enable
him
to
starve
like
a
man
when
the
alternative
was
to
eat
insult
with
his
bread
when
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
barrow
took
him
to
his
room
furnished
him
a
pipe
and
said
cheerily
now
old
fellow
take
in
your
out
of
the
wet
you
not
in
the
hostile
camp
any
more
you
a
little
upset
by
your
troubles
and
that
natural
enough
but
do
let
your
mind
run
on
them
anymore
than
you
can
help
drag
your
thoughts
away
from
your
troubles
by
the
ears
by
the
heels
or
any
other
way
so
you
manage
it
it
the
healthiest
thing
a
body
can
do
dwelling
on
troubles
is
deadly
just
deadly
and
the
softest
name
there
is
for
it
you
must
keep
your
mind
amused
you
must
oh
miserable
me
do
there
just
pure
in
that
tone
it
just
as
i
say
you
got
to
get
right
down
to
it
and
amuse
your
mind
as
if
it
was
they
easy
words
to
say
barrow
but
how
am
i
going
to
amuse
entertain
divert
a
mind
that
finds
itself
suddenly
assaulted
and
overwhelmed
by
disasters
of
a
sort
not
dreamed
of
and
not
provided
for
no
no
the
bare
idea
of
amusement
is
repulsive
to
my
feelings
let
us
talk
of
death
and
no
not
yet
that
would
be
giving
up
the
ship
we
not
give
up
the
ship
yet
i
going
to
amuse
you
i
sent
brady
out
for
the
wherewithal
before
you
finished
you
did
what
is
it
come
this
is
a
good
sign
curiosity
oh
there
hope
for
you
chapter
xvi
brady
arrived
with
a
box
and
departed
after
saying
they
finishing
one
up
but
they
be
along
as
soon
as
it
barrow
took
a
frameless
oil
portrait
a
foot
square
from
the
box
set
it
up
in
a
good
light
without
comment
and
reached
for
another
taking
a
furtive
glance
at
tracy
meantime
the
stony
solemnity
in
tracy
face
remained
as
it
was
and
gave
out
no
sign
of
interest
barrow
placed
the
second
portrait
beside
the
first
and
stole
another
glance
while
reaching
for
a
third
the
stone
image
softened
a
shade
no
forced
the
ghost
of
a
smile
no
swept
indifference
wholly
away
and
no
started
a
laugh
which
was
still
in
good
and
hearty
condition
when
no
took
its
place
in
the
row
oh
you
all
right
yet
said
barrow
you
see
you
not
past
the
pictures
were
fearful
as
to
color
and
atrocious
as
to
drawing
and
expression
but
the
feature
which
squelched
animosity
and
made
them
funny
was
a
feature
which
could
not
achieve
its
full
force
in
a
single
picture
but
required
the
assistance
of
repetition
one
loudly
dressed
mechanic
in
stately
attitude
with
his
hand
on
a
cannon
ashore
and
a
ship
riding
at
anchor
in
the
offing
this
is
merely
odd
but
when
one
sees
the
same
cannon
and
the
same
ship
in
fourteen
pictures
in
a
row
and
a
different
mechanic
standing
watch
in
each
the
thing
gets
to
be
funny
explain
explain
these
aberrations
said
tracy
well
they
are
not
the
achievement
of
a
single
intellect
a
single
talent
it
takes
two
to
do
these
miracles
they
are
collaborations
the
one
artist
does
the
figure
the
other
the
accessories
the
is
a
german
shoemaker
with
an
untaught
passion
for
art
the
other
is
a
simple
hearted
old
yankee
whose
possibilities
are
strictly
limited
to
his
ship
his
cannon
and
his
patch
of
petrified
sea
they
work
these
things
up
from
tintypes
they
get
six
dollars
apiece
for
them
and
they
can
grind
out
a
couple
a
day
when
they
strike
what
they
call
a
boost
that
is
an
people
actually
pay
money
for
these
calumnies
they
actually
do
and
quite
willingly
too
and
these
abortionists
could
double
their
trade
and
work
the
women
in
if
capt
saltmarsh
could
whirl
a
horse
in
or
a
piano
or
a
guitar
in
place
of
his
cannon
the
fact
is
he
fatigues
the
market
with
that
cannon
even
the
male
market
i
mean
these
fourteen
in
the
procession
are
not
all
satisfied
one
is
an
old
fireman
and
he
wants
an
engine
in
place
of
the
cannon
another
is
a
mate
of
a
tug
and
wants
a
tug
in
place
of
the
ship
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
the
captain
ca
make
a
tug
that
is
deceptive
and
a
fire
engine
is
many
flights
beyond
his
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
form
of
robbery
i
never
have
heard
of
anything
like
it
it
yes
and
so
are
the
artists
they
are
perfectly
honest
men
and
sincere
and
the
old
is
full
of
sound
religion
and
is
as
devoted
a
student
of
the
bible
and
misquoter
of
it
as
you
can
find
anywhere
i
do
know
a
better
man
or
kinder
hearted
old
soul
than
saltmarsh
although
he
does
swear
a
little
he
seems
to
be
perfect
i
want
to
know
him
you
have
the
chance
i
guess
i
hear
them
coming
now
we
draw
them
out
on
their
art
if
you
the
artists
arrived
and
shook
hands
with
great
heartiness
the
german
was
forty
and
a
little
fleshy
with
a
shiny
bald
head
and
a
kindly
face
and
deferential
manner
capt
saltmarsh
was
sixty
tall
erect
powerfully
built
with
hair
and
whiskers
and
he
had
a
well
tanned
complexion
and
a
gait
and
countenance
that
were
full
of
command
confidence
and
decision
his
horny
hands
and
wrists
were
covered
with
and
when
his
lips
parted
his
teeth
showed
up
white
and
blemishless
his
voice
was
the
effortless
deep
bass
of
a
church
organ
and
would
disturb
the
tranquility
of
a
gas
flame
fifty
yards
away
they
wonderful
pictures
said
barrow
we
been
examining
it
is
very
bleasant

the

i
can
honestly
say
i
have
never

anything
just
like
them
schon
cried
the
german
delighted
you
hear
gaptain
here

the
captain
was
charmed
and
said
well
sir
we
thankful
for
a
compliment
yet
though
they
not
as
scarce
now
as
they
used
to
be
before
we
made
a
getting
the
reputation
is
the
time
in
most
things
it
so
it
ai
enough
to
know
how
to
reef
a
gasket
you
got
to
make
the
mate
know
you
know
it
that
reputation
the
good
word
said
at
the
right
time
that
the
word
that
makes
us
and
evil
be
to
him
that
evil
thinks
as
isaiah
it
very
relevant
and
hits
the
point
exactly
said
tracy
where
did
you
study
art
captain
i
have
studied
it
a
natural
he
is

and
take

py

of
he
could

of
he
could

of
he
could
do
a
vashtub
it
is
a
fortune
heiliger
yohanniss
it
is
yoost
a
fortune
well
it
is
an
immense
pity
that
the
business
is
hindered
and
limited
in
this
unfortunate
the
captain
grew
a
trifle
excited
himself
now
you
said
it
mr
tracy
hindered
well
i
should
say
so
why
look
here
this
fellow
here
no
he
a
hackman
a
flourishing
hackman
i
may
say
he
wants
his
hack
in
this
picture
wants
it
where
the
cannon
is
i
got
around
that
difficulty
by
telling
him
the
cannon
our
trademark
so
to
speak
proves
that
the
picture
our
work
and
i
was
afraid
if
we
left
it
out
people
would
know
for
certain
if
it
was
a
saltmarsh
handel
now
you
would
yourself
what
captain
you
wrong
yourself
indeed
you
do
anyone
who
has
once
seen
a
genuine
is
safe
from
imposture
forever
strip
it
flay
it
skin
it
out
of
every
detail
but
the
bare
color
and
expression
and
that
man
will
still
recognize
it
still
stop
to
worship
oh
how
it
makes
me
feel
to
hear
dose
oxpressions
still
say
to
himself
again
as
he
had
said
a
hundred
times
before
the
art
of
the
is
an
art
apart
there
is
nothing
in
the
heavens
above
or
in
the
earth
beneath
that
resembles
it
py
chiminy
nur
horen
sie
einmal
in
my
life
day
haf
i
never
heard
so
brecious
so
i
talked
him
out
of
the
hack
tracy
and
he
let
up
on
that
and
said
put
in
a
hearse
then
because
he
chief
mate
of
a
hearse
but
do
own
it
stands
a
watch
for
wages
you
know
but
i
ca
do
a
hearse
any
more
than
i
can
a
hack
so
here
we
are
becalmed
you
see
and
it
the
same
with
women
and
such
they
come
and
they
want
a
little
johnry
picture
it
the
accessories
that
make
it
a
yes
cannon
or
cat
or
any
little
thing
like
that
that
you
heave
in
to
whoop
up
the
effect
we
could
do
a
prodigious
trade
with
the
women
if
we
could
foreground
the
things
they
like
but
they
do
give
a
damn
for
artillery
mine
the
lack
continued
the
captain
with
a
sigh
end
of
the
business
is
all
right
i
tell
you
he
an
artist
from
way
back
yoost
hear
dot
old
man
he
always
talk
me
like
dot
purred
the
pleased
german
look
at
his
work
yourself
fourteen
portraits
in
a
row
and
no
two
of
them
now
that
you
speak
of
it
it
is
true
i
had
noticed
it
before
it
is
very
remarkable
unique
i
i
should
say
so
that
the
very
thing
about
andy
he
discriminates
discrimination
the
thief
of
time
psalm
but
that
any
matter
it
the
honest
thing
and
it
pays
in
the
yes
he
certainly
is
great
in
that
feature
one
is
obliged
to
admit
it
but
now
mind
i
not
really
criticising
do
you
think
he
is
just
a
trifle
overstrong
in
technique
the
captain
face
was
knocked
expressionless
by
this
remark
it
remained
quite
vacant
while
he
muttered
to
himself
technique
technique
polytechnique
that
it
likely
fireworks
too
much
then
he
spoke
up
with
serenity
and
confidence
and
said
well
yes
he
does
pile
it
on
pretty
loud
but
they
all
like
it
you
know
fact
is
it
the
life
of
the
business
take
that
no
there
evans
the

as
anything
you
ever
see

at
him

tell
him
from

butcher

a
study
of

and
i
do
really
reckon
i
can
do

right
but
if
i
can
we
can
break
the
unquestionably
your
confederate
i
mean
your
your
is
a
great
colorist
oh
danke
schon
in
fact
a
quite
extraordinary
colorist
a
colorist
i
make
bold
to
say
without
imitator
here
or
abroad
and
with
a
most
bold
and
effective
touch
a
touch
like
a
battering
ram
and
a
manner
so
peculiar
and
romantic
and
extraneous
and
ad
libitum
and
that
that
he
he
is
an
impressionist
i
presume
no
said
the
captain
simply
he
is
a
it
accounts
for
it
all
all
there
something
divine
about
his
art
soulful
unsatisfactory
yearning
dim
hearkening
on
the
void
horizon
vague
murmuring
to
the
spirit
out
of
distances
and
cataclysms
of
uncreated
space
oh
if
he
if
he
has
he
ever
tried
distemper
the
captain
answered
up
with
energy
not
if
he
knows
himself
but
his
dog
has
and
oh
no
it
vas
not
my
why
you
said
it
was
your
oh
no
gaptain
i
it
was
a
white
dog
was
it
with
his
tail
docked
and
one
ear
gone
and
dot
him
dot
him
der
fery
dog
wy
py
chorge
dot

he
would
eat
baint
yoost
de
same
like
well
never
mind
that
now
heaving
i
never
saw
such
a
man
you
start
him
on
that
dog
and
he
dispute
a
year
blamed
if
i
have
seen
him
keep
it
up
a
level
two
hours
and
a
why
captain
said
barrow
i
guess
that
must
be
no
sir
no
hearsay
about
it
he
disputed
with
i
do
see
how
you
stood
oh
you
got
to
if
you
run
with
andy
but
it
the
only
fault
ai
you
afraid
of
acquiring
it
oh
no
said
the
captain
tranquilly
no
danger
of
that
i
the
artists
presently
took
their
leave
then
barrow
put
his
hands
on
tracy
shoulders
and
said
look
me
in
the
eye
my
boy
steady
steady
there
it
just
as
i
thought
hoped
anyway
you
all
right
thank
goodness
nothing
the
matter
with
your
mind
but
do
do
that
again
even
for
fun
it
wise
they
would
have
believed
you
if
you
been
an
earl
son
why
they
could
do
you
know
that
what
ever
possessed
you
to
take
such
a
freak
but
never
mind
about
that
let
not
talk
of
it
it
was
a
mistake
you
see
that
yes
it
was
a
well
just
drop
it
out
of
your
mind
it
no
harm
we
all
make
them
pull
your
courage
together
and
do
brood
and
do
give
up
i
at
your
back
and
we
pull
through
do
you
be
when
he
was
gone
barrow
walked
the
floor
a
good
while
uneasy
in
his
mind
he
said
to
himself
i
troubled
about
him
he
never
would
have
made
a
break
like
that
if
he
had
been
a
little
off
his
balance
but
i
know
what
being
out
of
work
and
no
prospect
ahead
can
do
for
a
man
first
it
knocks
the
pluck
out
of
him
and
drags
his
pride
in
the
dirt
worry
does
the
rest
and
his
mind
gets
shaky
i
must
talk
to
these
people
no
if
there
any
humanity
in
them
and
there
is
at
bottom
they
be
easier
on
him
if
they
think
his
troubles
have
disturbed
his
reason
but
i
got
to
find
him
some
work
work
the
only
medicine
for
his
disease
poor
devil
away
off
here
and
not
a
chapter
xvii
the
moment
tracy
was
alone
his
spirits
vanished
away
and
all
the
misery
of
his
situation
was
manifest
to
him
to
be
moneyless
and
an
object
of
the
chairmaker
charity
this
was
bad
enough
but
his
folly
in
proclaiming
himself
an
earl
son
to
that
scoffing
and
unbelieving
crew
and
on
top
of
that
the
humiliating
result
the
recollection
of
these
things
was
a
sharper
torture
still
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
never
play
earl
son
again
before
a
doubtful
audience
his
father
answer
was
a
blow
he
could
not
understand
at
times
he
thought
his
father
imagined
he
could
get
work
to
do
in
america
without
any
trouble
and
was
minded
to
let
him
try
it
and
cure
himself
of
his
radicalism
by
hard
cold
disenchanting
experience
that
seemed
the
most
plausible
theory
yet
he
could
not
content
himself
with
it
a
theory
that
pleased
him
better
was
that
this
cablegram
would
be
followed
by
another
of
a
gentler
sort
requiring
him
to
come
home
should
he
write
and
strike
his
flag
and
ask
for
a
ticket
home
oh
no
that
he
ever
do
at
least
not
yet
that
cablegram
would
come
it
certainly
would
so
he
went
from
one
telegraph
office
to
another
every
day
for
nearly
a
week
and
asked
if
there
was
a
cablegram
for
howard
tracy
no
there
was
any
so
they
answered
him
at
first
later
they
said
it
before
he
had
a
chance
to
ask
later
still
they
merely
shook
their
heads
impatiently
as
soon
as
he
came
in
sight
after
that
he
was
ashamed
to
go
any
more
he
was
down
in
the
lowest
depths
of
despair
now
for
the
harder
barrow
tried
to
find
work
for
him
the
more
hopeless
the
possibilities
seemed
to
grow
at
last
he
said
to
barrow
look
here
i
want
to
make
a
confession
i
have
got
down
now
to
where
i
am
not
only
willing
to
acknowledge
to
myself
that
i
am
a
shabby
creature
and
full
of
false
pride
but
am
willing
to
acknowledge
it
to
you
well
i
been
allowing
you
to
wear
yourself
out
hunting
for
work
for
me
when
there
been
a
chance
open
to
me
all
the
time
forgive
my
pride
what
was
left
of
it
it
is
all
gone
now
and
i
come
to
confess
that
if
those
ghastly
artists
want
another
confederate
their
man
for
at
last
i
am
dead
to
no
really
can
you
paint
not
as
badly
as
they
no
i
do
claim
that
for
i
am
not
a
genius
in
fact
i
am
a
very
indifferent
amateur
a
slouchy
dabster
a
mere
artistic
sarcasm
but
drunk
or
asleep
i
can
beat
those
shake
i
want
to
shout
oh
i
tell
you
i
am
immensely
delighted
and
relieved
oh
just
to
work
that
is
life
no
matter
what
the
work
is
that
of
no
consequence
just
work
itself
is
bliss
when
a
been
starving
for
it
i
been
there
come
right
along
we
hunt
the
old
boys
up
do
you
feel
good
i
tell
you
i
the
freebooters
were
not
at
home
but
their
works
were
displayed
in
profusion
all
about
the
little
ratty
studio
cannon
to
the
right
of
them
cannon
to
the
left
of
them
cannon
in
front
it
was
balaclava
come
again
here
the
uncontented
hackman
tracy
buckle
to
deepen
the
to
turf
turn
the
ship
into
a
hearse
let
the
boys
have
a
taste
of
your
the
artists
arrived
just
as
the
last
touch
was
put
on
they
stood
transfixed
with
admiration
my
souls
but
she
a
stunner
that
hearse
the
hackman
will
just
go
all
to
pieces
when
he
sees
that
wo
he
andy
oh
it
is
sphlennid
sphlennid
herr
tracy
why
haf
you
not
said
you
vas
a
so
sublime
aartist
lob
gott
of
you
had
lif
in
paris
you
would
be
a
pree
de
rome
dot
votes
de
matter
the
arrangements
were
soon
made
tracy
was
taken
into
full
and
equal
partnership
and
he
went
straight
to
work
with
dash
and
energy
to
reconstructing
gems
of
art
whose
accessories
had
failed
to
satisfy
under
his
hand
on
that
and
succeeding
days
artillery
disappeared
and
the
emblems
of
peace
and
commerce
took
its
place
cats
hacks
sausages
tugs
fire
engines
pianos
guitars
rocks
gardens
landscapes
whatever
was
wanted
he
flung
it
in
and
the
more
out
of
place
and
absurd
the
required
object
was
the
more
joy
he
got
out
of
fabricating
it
the
pirates
were
delighted
the
customers
applauded
the
sex
began
to
flock
in
great
was
the
prosperity
of
the
firm
tracy
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
there
was
something
about
work
even
such
grotesque
and
humble
work
as
this
which
most
pleasantly
satisfied
a
something
in
his
nature
which
had
never
been
satisfied
before
and
also
gave
him
a
strange
new
dignity
in
his
own
private
view
of
himself
the
unqualified
member
from
cherokee
strip
was
in
a
state
of
deep
dejection
for
a
good
while
now
he
had
been
leading
a
sort
of
life
which
was
calculated
to
kill
for
it
had
consisted
in
regularly
alternating
days
of
brilliant
hope
and
black
disappointment
the
brilliant
hopes
were
created
by
the
magician
sellers
and
they
always
promised
that
now
he
had
got
the
trick
sure
and
would
effectively
influence
that
materialized
cowboy
to
call
at
the
towers
before
night
the
black
disappointments
consisted
in
the
persistent
and
monotonous
failure
of
these
prophecies
at
the
date
which
this
history
has
now
reached
sellers
was
appalled
to
find
that
the
usual
remedy
was
inoperative
and
that
low
spirits
refused
absolutely
to
lift
something
must
be
done
he
reflected
it
was
this
woe
this
smileless
misery
this
dull
despair
that
looked
out
from
his
poor
friend
face
yes
he
must
be
cheered
up
he
mused
a
while
then
he
saw
his
way
he
said
in
his
most
conspicuously
casual
vein
er
uh
by
the
way
hawkins
we
are
feeling
disappointed
about
this
thing
the
way
the
materializee
is
acting
i
mean
we
are
disappointed
you
concede
that
concede
it
why
yes
if
you
like
the
very
well
so
far
so
good
now
for
the
basis
of
the
feeling
it
is
not
that
your
heart
your
affections
are
concerned
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
that
you
want
the
materializee
itself
you
concede
that
yes
i
concede
that
too
very
well
again
we
are
making
progress
to
sum
up
the
feeling
it
is
conceded
is
not
engendered
by
the
mere
conduct
of
the
materializee
it
is
conceded
that
it
does
not
arise
from
any
pang
which
the
personality
of
the
materializee
could
assuage
now
then
said
the
earl
with
the
light
of
triumph
in
his
eye
the
inexorable
logic
of
the
situation
narrows
us
down
to
this
our
feeling
has
its
source
in
the
involved
come
is
that
so
goodness
knows
i
concede
that
with
all
my
very
well
when
you
found
out
the
source
of
a
disease
you
also
found
out
what
remedy
is
required
just
as
in
this
case
in
this
case
money
is
required
and
only
the
old
old
seduction
was
in
that
airy
confident
tone
and
those
significant
words
usually
called
pregnant
words
in
books
the
old
answering
signs
of
faith
and
hope
showed
up
in
hawkins
countenance
and
he
said
only
money
do
you
mean
that
you
know
a
way
to
washington
have
you
the
impression
that
i
have
no
resources
but
those
i
allow
the
public
and
my
intimate
friends
to
know
about
well
i
er
is
it
likely
do
you
think
that
a
man
moved
by
nature
and
taught
by
experience
to
keep
his
affairs
to
himself
and
a
cautious
and
reluctant
tongue
in
his
head
would
be
thoughtful
enough
to
keep
a
few
resources
in
reserve
for
a
rainy
day
when
he
got
as
many
as
i
have
to
select
from
oh
you
make
me
feel
so
much
better
already
colonel
have
you
ever
been
in
my
laboratory
why
that
it
you
see
you
did
even
know
that
i
had
one
come
along
i
got
a
little
trick
there
that
i
want
to
show
you
i
kept
it
perfectly
quiet
not
fifty
people
know
anything
about
it
but
that
my
way
always
been
my
way
wait
till
you
ready
that
the
idea
and
when
you
ready
zzip
let
her
go
well
colonel
i
never
seen
a
man
that
i
had
such
unbounded
confidence
in
as
you
when
you
say
a
thing
right
out
i
always
feel
as
if
that
ends
it
as
if
that
is
evidence
and
proof
and
everything
the
old
earl
was
profoundly
pleased
and
touched
i
glad
you
believe
in
me
washington
not
everybody
is
so
i
always
have
believed
in
you
and
i
always
shall
as
long
as
i
thank
you
my
boy
you
sha
repent
it
and
you
arrived
in
the
laboratory
the
earl
continued
now
cast
your
eye
around
this
room
what
do
you
see
apparently
a
apparently
a
hospital
connected
with
a
patent
office
in
reality
the
mines
of
golconda
in
disguise
look
at
that
thing
there
now
what
would
you
take
that
thing
to
be
i
do
believe
i
could
ever
of
course
you
could
it
my
grand
adaptation
of
the
phonograph
to
the
marine
service
you
store
up
profanity
in
it
for
use
at
sea
you
know
that
sailors
do
fly
around
worth
a
cent
unless
you
swear
at
them
so
the
mate
that
can
do
the
best
job
of
swearing
is
the
most
valuable
man
in
great
emergencies
his
talent
saves
the
ship
but
a
ship
is
a
large
thing
and
he
ca
be
everywhere
at
once
so
there
have
been
times
when
one
mate
has
lost
a
ship
which
could
have
been
saved
if
they
had
had
a
hundred
prodigious
storms
you
know
well
a
ship
ca
afford
a
hundred
mates
but
she
can
afford
a
hundred
cursing
phonographs
and
distribute
them
all
over
the
vessel
and
there
you
see
she
armed
at
every
point
imagine
a
big
storm
and
a
hundred
of
my
machines
all
cursing
away
at
once
splendid
spectacle
splendid
you
could
hear
yourself
think
ship
goes
through
that
storm
perfectly
serene
she
just
as
safe
as
she
be
on
it
a
wonderful
idea
how
do
you
prepare
the
thing
load
it
simply
load
how
why
you
just
stand
over
it
and
swear
into
that
loads
it
does
it
yes
because
every
word
it
collars
it
keeps
keeps
it
forever
never
wears
out
any
time
you
turn
the
crank
out
it
come
in
times
of
great
peril
you
can
reverse
it
and
it
swear
backwards
that
makes
a
sailor
hump
himself
o
i
see
who
loads
them
the
mate
yes
if
he
chooses
or
i
furnish
them
already
loaded
i
can
hire
an
expert
for
a
month
who
will
load
a
hundred
and
fifty
phonographs
in
hours
and
do
it
easy
and
an
expert
can
furnish
a
stronger
article
of
course
than
the
mere
average
uncultivated
mate
could
then
you
see
all
the
ships
of
the
world
will
buy
them
ready
loaded
for
i
shall
have
them
loaded
in
any
language
a
customer
wants
hawkins
it
will
work
the
grandest
moral
reform
of
the
century
five
years
from
now
all
the
swearing
will
be
done
by
machinery
you
wo
ever
hear
a
profane
word
come
from
human
lips
on
a
ship
millions
of
dollars
have
been
spent
by
the
churches
in
the
effort
to
abolish
profanity
in
the
commercial
marine
think
of
it
my
name
will
live
forever
in
the
affections
of
good
men
as
the
man
who
solitary
and
alone
accomplished
this
noble
and
elevating
o
it
is
grand
and
beneficent
and
beautiful
how
did
you
ever
come
to
think
of
it
you
have
a
wonderful
mind
how
did
you
say
you
loaded
the
machine
o
it
no
trouble
perfectly
simple
if
you
want
to
load
it
up
loud
and
strong
you
stand
right
over
it
and
shout
but
if
you
leave
it
open
and
all
set
it
eavesdrop
so
to
speak
that
is
to
say
it
will
load
itself
up
with
any
sounds
that
are
made
within
six
feet
of
it
now
i
show
you
how
it
works
i
had
an
expert
come
and
load
this
one
up
yesterday
hello
it
been
left
open
it
too
bad
still
i
reckon
it
has
had
much
chance
to
collect
irrelevant
stuff
all
you
do
is
to
press
this
button
in
the
floor
the
phonograph
began
to
sing
in
a
plaintive
voice
there
is
a
far
far
away
where
they
have
ham
and
eggs
times
a
day
hang
it
that
ai
it
somebody
been
singing
around
the
plaintive
song
began
again
mingled
with
a
low
gradually
rising
wail
of
cats
slowly
warming
up
toward
a
fight
o
how
the
boarders
yell
when
they
hear
that
dinner
bell
they
give
that
landlord
momentary
outburst
of
terrific
catfight
which
drowns
out
one
word
three
times
a
day
renewal
of
furious
catfight
for
a
moment
the
plaintive
voice
on
a
high
fierce
key
scat
you
devils
and
a
racket
as
of
flying
missiles
well
never
mind
let
it
go
i
got
some
down
in
there
somewhere
if
i
could
get
to
it
but
it
is
any
matter
you
see
how
the
machine
hawkins
responded
with
enthusiasm
o
it
works
admirably
i
know
there
a
hundred
fortunes
in
and
mind
the
hawkins
family
get
their
share
o
thanks
thanks
you
are
just
as
generous
as
ever
ah
it
the
grandest
invention
of
the
age
ah
well
we
live
in
wonderful
times
the
elements
are
crowded
full
of
beneficent
forces
always
have
been
and
ours
is
the
first
generation
to
turn
them
to
account
and
make
them
work
for
us
why
hawkins
everything
is
useful
nothing
ought
ever
to
be
wasted
now
look
at
sewer
gas
for
instance
sewer
gas
has
always
been
wasted
heretofore
nobody
tried
to
save
up
you
ca
name
me
a
man
ai
that
so
you
know
perfectly
well
it
yes
it
is
so
but
i
never
er
i
do
quite
see
why
a
body
should
want
to
save
it
up
well
i
tell
you
do
you
see
this
little
invention
here
it
a
decomposer
i
call
it
a
decomposer
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
if
you
show
me
a
house
that
produces
a
given
quantity
of
in
a
day
i
engage
to
set
up
my
decomposer
there
and
make
that
house
produce
a
hundred
times
that
quantity
of
in
less
than
half
an
dear
me
but
why
should
you
want
to
want
to
listen
and
you
see
my
boy
for
illuminating
purposes
and
economy
combined
there
nothing
in
the
world
that
begins
with
and
really
it
do
cost
a
cent
you
put
in
a
good
inferior
article
of
plumbing
such
as
you
find
everywhere
and
add
my
decomposer
and
there
you
are
just
use
the
ordinary
gas
pipes
and
there
your
expense
ends
think
of
it
why
major
in
five
years
from
now
you
wo
see
a
house
lighted
with
anything
but
every
physician
i
talk
to
recommends
it
and
every
but
is
it
dangerous
o
yes
more
or
less
but
everything
is
coal
gas
candles
electricity
there
is
anything
that
it
lights
up
well
does
it
o
have
you
given
it
a
good
trial
well
no
not
a
first
rate
one
polly
prejudiced
and
she
wo
let
me
put
it
in
here
but
i
playing
my
cards
to
get
it
adopted
in
the
president
house
and
then
it
go
do
you
doubt
it
i
shall
not
need
this
one
for
the
present
washington
you
may
take
it
down
to
some
and
give
it
a
trial
if
you
chapter
xviii
washington
shuddered
slightly
at
the
suggestion
then
his
face
took
on
a
dreamy
look
and
he
dropped
into
a
trance
of
thought
after
a
little
sellers
asked
him
what
he
was
grinding
in
his
mental
mill
well
this
have
you
got
some
secret
project
in
your
head
which
requires
a
bank
of
england
back
of
it
to
make
it
succeed
the
colonel
showed
lively
astonishment
and
said
why
hawkins
are
you
a
i
i
never
thought
of
such
a
well
then
how
did
you
happen
to
drop
onto
that
idea
in
this
curious
fashion
it
just
that
what
it
is
though
you
may
not
know
it
because
i
have
got
a
private
project
that
requires
a
bank
of
england
at
its
back
how
could
you
divine
that
what
was
the
process
this
is
there
was
any
process
a
thought
like
this
happened
to
slip
through
my
head
by
accident
how
much
would
make
you
or
me
comfortable
a
hundred
thousand
yet
you
are
expecting
two
or
three
of
these
inventions
of
yours
to
turn
out
some
billions
of
money
and
you
are
wanting
them
to
do
that
if
you
wanted
ten
millions
i
could
understand
that
it
inside
the
human
limits
but
billions
that
clear
outside
the
limits
there
must
be
a
definite
project
back
of
that
the
earl
interest
and
surprise
augmented
with
every
word
and
when
hawkins
finished
he
said
with
strong
admiration
it
wonderfully
reasoned
out
washington
it
certainly
is
it
shows
what
i
think
is
quite
extraordinary
penetration
for
you
hit
it
you
driven
the
centre
you
plugged
the
of
my
dream
now
i
tell
you
the
whole
thing
and
you
understand
it
i
do
need
to
ask
you
to
keep
it
to
yourself
because
you
see
that
the
project
will
prosper
all
the
better
for
being
kept
in
the
background
till
the
right
time
have
you
noticed
how
many
pamphlets
and
books
i
got
lying
around
relating
to
russia
yes
i
think
most
anybody
would
notice
that
anybody
who
was
well
i
been
posting
myself
a
good
while
that
a
great
and
splendid
nation
and
deserves
to
be
set
he
paused
then
added
in
a
quite
way
when
i
get
this
money
i
going
to
set
it
great
guns
why
what
makes
you
jump
like
that
dear
me
when
you
are
going
to
drop
a
remark
under
a
man
chair
that
is
likely
to
blow
him
out
through
the
roof
why
do
you
put
some
expression
some
force
some
noise
into
it
that
will
prepare
him
you
should
flip
out
such
a
gigantic
thing
as
this
in
that
colorless
kind
of
a
way
you
do
jolt
a
person
up
so
go
on
now
i
am
all
right
again
tell
me
all
about
it
i
all
interest
yes
and
sympathy
well
i
looked
the
ground
over
and
concluded
that
the
methods
of
the
russian
patriots
while
good
enough
considering
the
way
the
boys
are
hampered
are
not
the
best
at
least
not
the
quickest
they
are
trying
to
revolutionize
russia
from
within
that
pretty
slow
you
know
and
liable
to
interruption
all
the
time
and
is
full
of
perils
for
the
workers
do
you
know
how
peter
the
great
started
his
army
he
start
it
on
the
family
premises
under
the
noses
of
the
strelitzes
no
he
started
it
away
off
yonder
privately
only
just
one
regiment
you
know
and
he
built
to
that
the
first
thing
the
strelitzes
knew
the
regiment
was
an
army
their
position
was
turned
and
they
had
to
take
a
walk
just
that
little
idea
made
the
biggest
and
worst
of
all
the
despotisms
the
world
has
seen
the
same
idea
can
unmake
it
i
going
to
prove
it
i
going
to
get
out
to
one
side
and
work
my
scheme
the
way
peter
this
is
mighty
interesting
rossmore
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do
i
am
going
to
buy
siberia
and
start
a
there
bang
you
go
again
without
giving
any
notice
going
to
buy
it
yes
as
soon
as
i
get
the
money
i
do
care
what
the
price
is
i
shall
take
it
i
can
afford
it
and
i
will
now
then
consider
this
and
you
never
thought
of
it
i
warrant
where
is
the
place
where
there
is
times
more
manhood
pluck
true
heroism
unselfishness
devotion
to
high
and
noble
ideals
adoration
of
liberty
wide
education
and
brains
per
thousand
of
population
than
any
other
domain
in
the
whole
world
can
show
siberia
it
is
true
it
certainly
is
true
but
i
never
thought
of
it
nobody
ever
thinks
of
it
but
it
so
just
the
same
in
those
mines
and
prisons
are
gathered
together
the
very
finest
and
noblest
and
capablest
multitude
of
human
beings
that
god
is
able
to
create
now
if
you
had
that
kind
of
a
population
to
sell
would
you
offer
it
to
a
despotism
no
the
despotism
has
no
use
for
it
you
would
lose
money
a
despotism
has
no
use
for
anything
but
human
cattle
but
suppose
you
want
to
start
a
republic
yes
i
see
it
just
the
material
for
well
i
should
say
so
there
siberia
with
just
the
very
finest
and
choicest
material
on
the
globe
for
a
republic
and
more
coming
more
coming
all
the
time
do
you
see
it
is
being
daily
weekly
monthly
recruited
by
the
most
perfectly
devised
system
that
has
ever
been
invented
perhaps
by
this
system
the
whole
of
the
hundred
millions
of
russia
are
being
constantly
and
patiently
sifted
sifted
sifted
by
myriads
of
trained
experts
spies
appointed
by
the
emperor
personally
and
whenever
they
catch
a
man
woman
or
child
that
has
got
any
brains
or
education
or
character
they
ship
that
person
straight
to
siberia
it
is
admirable
it
is
wonderful
it
is
so
searching
and
so
effective
that
it
keeps
the
general
level
of
russian
intellect
and
education
down
to
that
of
the
come
that
sounds
like
well
it
what
they
say
anyway
but
i
think
myself
it
a
lie
and
it
does
seem
right
to
slander
a
whole
nation
that
way
anyhow
now
then
you
see
what
the
material
is
there
in
siberia
for
a
he
paused
and
his
breast
began
to
heave
and
his
eye
to
burn
under
the
impulse
of
strong
emotion
then
his
words
began
to
stream
forth
with
constantly
increasing
energy
and
fire
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
if
to
give
himself
larger
freedom
the
minute
i
organize
that
republic
the
light
of
liberty
intelligence
justice
humanity
bursting
from
it
flooding
from
it
flaming
from
it
will
concentrate
the
gaze
of
the
whole
astonished
world
as
upon
the
miracle
of
a
new
sun
countless
multitudes
of
slaves
will
rise
up
and
march
march
eastward
with
that
great
light
transfiguring
their
faces
as
they
come
and
far
back
of
them
you
will
will
you
see
a
vacant
throne
in
an
empty
land
it
can
be
done
and
by
god
i
will
do
it
he
stood
a
moment
bereft
of
earthly
consciousness
by
his
exaltation
then
consciousness
returned
bringing
him
a
slight
shock
and
he
said
with
grave
earnestness
i
must
ask
you
to
pardon
me
major
hawkins
i
have
never
used
that
expression
before
and
i
beg
you
will
forgive
it
this
hawkins
was
quite
willing
you
see
washington
it
is
an
error
which
i
am
by
nature
not
liable
to
only
excitable
people
impulsive
people
are
exposed
to
it
but
the
circumstances
of
the
present
case
i
being
a
democrat
by
birth
and
preference
and
an
aristocrat
by
inheritance
and
relish
the
earl
stopped
suddenly
his
frame
stiffened
and
he
began
to
stare
speechless
through
the
curtainless
window
then
he
pointed
and
gasped
out
a
single
rapturous
word
look
what
is
it
colonel
it
no
sure
as
you
born
keep
perfectly
still
i
apply
the
influence
i
turn
on
all
my
force
i
brought
it
thus
far
fetch
it
right
into
the
house
you
he
was
making
all
sorts
of
passes
in
the
air
with
his
hands
there
look
at
that
i
made
it
smile
see
quite
true
tracy
out
for
an
afternoon
stroll
had
come
unexpectantly
upon
his
family
arms
displayed
upon
this
shabby
the
hatchments
made
him
smile
which
was
nothing
they
had
made
the
neighborhood
cats
do
that
look
hawkins
look
i
drawing
it
over
you
drawing
it
sure
rossmore
if
i
ever
had
any
doubts
about
materialization
they
gone
now
and
gone
for
good
oh
this
is
a
joyful
day
tracy
was
sauntering
over
to
read
the
before
he
was
half
way
over
he
was
saying
to
himself
why
manifestly
these
are
the
american
claimant
it
coming
coming
right
along
i
slide
down
and
pull
it
in
you
follow
after
sellers
pale
and
a
good
deal
agitated
opened
the
door
and
confronted
tracy
the
old
man
could
not
at
once
get
his
voice
then
he
pumped
out
a
scattering
and
hardly
coherent
salutation
and
followed
it
with
walk
in
walk
right
in
er
tracy
howard
tracy
thanks
walk
right
in
you
tracy
entered
considerably
puzzled
and
said
expected
i
think
there
must
be
some
oh
i
judge
not
said
sellers
who
noticing
that
hawkins
had
arrived
gave
him
a
sidewise
glance
intended
to
call
his
close
attention
to
a
dramatic
effect
which
he
was
proposing
to
produce
by
his
next
remark
then
he
said
slowly
and
impressively
i
am
you
know
to
the
astonishment
of
both
conspirators
the
remark
produced
no
dramatic
effect
at
all
for
the
responded
with
a
quite
innocent
and
unembarrassed
air
no
pardon
me
i
do
know
who
you
are
i
only
suppose
but
no
doubt
correctly
that
you
are
the
gentleman
whose
title
is
on
the
right
quite
right
sit
down
pray
sit
the
earl
was
rattled
thrown
off
his
bearings
his
head
was
in
a
whirl
then
he
noticed
hawkins
standing
apart
and
staring
idiotically
at
what
to
him
was
the
apparition
of
a
defunct
man
and
a
new
idea
was
born
to
him
he
said
to
tracy
briskly
but
a
thousand
pardons
dear
sir
i
am
forgetting
courtesies
due
to
a
guest
and
stranger
let
me
introduce
my
friend
general
hawkins
general
hawkins
our
new
senator
senator
from
the
latest
and
grandest
addition
to
the
radiant
galaxy
of
sovereign
states
cherokee
strip
to
himself
that
name
will
shrivel
him
up
but
it
did
in
the
least
and
the
colonel
resumed
the
introduction
piteously
disheartened
and
amazed
senator
hawkins
howard
tracy
of
er
england
why
that
im
england
yes
native
of
recently
from
there
yes
quite
said
the
colonel
to
himself
this
phantom
lies
like
an
expert
purifying
this
kind
by
fire
do
work
i
sound
him
a
little
further
give
him
another
chance
or
two
to
work
his
then
aloud
with
deep
irony
visiting
our
great
country
for
recreation
and
amusement
no
doubt
i
suppose
you
find
that
traveling
in
the
majestic
expanses
of
our
far
west
is
i
have
been
west
and
have
been
devoting
myself
to
amusement
with
any
sort
of
exclusiveness
i
assure
you
in
fact
to
merely
live
an
artist
has
got
to
work
not
artist
said
hawkins
to
himself
thinking
of
the
rifled
bank
that
is
a
name
for
it
are
you
an
artist
asked
the
colonel
and
added
to
himself
now
going
to
catch
in
a
humble
way
what
line
pursued
the
sly
veteran
i
got
him
said
sellers
to
himself
then
aloud
this
is
fortunate
could
i
engage
you
to
restore
some
of
my
paintings
that
need
that
attention
i
shall
be
very
glad
pray
let
me
see
no
shuffling
no
evasion
no
embarrassment
even
under
this
crucial
test
the
colonel
was
nonplussed
he
led
tracy
to
a
chromo
which
had
suffered
damage
in
a
former
owner
hands
through
being
used
as
a
lamp
mat
and
said
with
a
flourish
of
his
hand
toward
the
picture
this
del
sarto
is
that
a
del
sarto
the
colonel
bent
a
look
of
reproach
upon
tracy
allowed
it
to
sink
home
then
resumed
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
this
del
sarto
is
perhaps
the
only
original
of
that
sublime
master
in
our
country
you
see
yourself
that
the
work
is
of
such
exceeding
delicacy
that
the
risk
could
er
would
you
mind
giving
me
a
little
example
of
what
you
can
do
before
we
cheerfully
cheerfully
i
will
copy
one
of
these
materials
relics
of
miss
sally
college
life
were
brought
tracy
said
he
was
better
in
oils
but
would
take
a
chance
with
these
so
he
was
left
alone
he
began
his
work
but
the
attractions
of
the
place
were
too
strong
for
him
and
he
got
up
and
went
drifting
about
fascinated
also
amazed
chapter
xix
meantime
the
earl
and
hawkins
were
holding
a
troubled
and
anxious
private
consultation
the
earl
said
the
mystery
that
bothers
me
is
where
did
it
get
its
other
arm
yes
it
worries
me
too
and
another
thing
troubles
me
the
apparition
is
english
how
do
you
account
for
that
colonel
honestly
i
do
know
hawkins
i
do
really
know
it
is
very
confusing
and
do
you
think
maybe
we
waked
up
the
wrong
one
the
wrong
one
how
do
you
account
for
the
clothes
the
clothes
are
right
there
no
getting
around
it
what
are
we
going
to
do
we
ca
collect
as
i
see
the
reward
is
for
a
american
this
is
a
well
it
may
be
that
that
is
not
objectionable
you
see
it
is
less
than
is
called
for
it
is
more
and
so
but
he
saw
that
this
argument
was
weak
and
dropped
it
the
friends
sat
brooding
over
their
perplexities
some
time
in
silence
finally
the
earl
face
began
to
glow
with
an
inspiration
and
he
said
impressively
hawkins
this
materialization
is
a
grander
and
nobler
science
than
we
have
dreamed
of
we
have
little
imagined
what
a
solemn
and
stupendous
thing
we
have
done
the
whole
secret
is
perfectly
clear
to
me
now
clear
as
day
every
man
is
made
up
of
heredities
atoms
and
particles
of
his
ancestors
this
present
materialization
is
incomplete
we
have
only
brought
it
down
to
perhaps
the
beginning
of
this
what
do
you
mean
colonel
cried
hawkins
filled
with
vague
alarms
by
the
old
man
words
and
manner
this
we
materialized
this
burglar
ancestor
oh
do
do
say
that
it
but
it
true
hawkins
i
know
it
look
at
the
facts
this
apparition
is
distinctly
english
note
that
it
uses
good
grammar
note
that
it
is
an
artist
note
that
it
has
the
manners
and
carriage
of
a
gentleman
note
that
where
your
answer
me
rossmore
this
is
dreadful
it
too
dreadful
to
think
of
never
resurrected
a
rag
of
that
burglar
but
the
clothes
not
a
solitary
rag
of
him
but
the
colonel
do
you
really
mean
the
colonel
brought
his
fist
down
with
emphasis
and
said
i
mean
exactly
this
this
materialization
was
immature
the
burglar
has
evaded
us
this
is
nothing
but
a
damned
ancestor
he
rose
and
walked
the
floor
in
great
excitement
hawkins
said
plaintively
it
a
bitter
disappointment
i
know
it
i
know
it
senator
i
feel
it
as
deeply
as
anybody
could
but
we
got
to
submit
on
moral
grounds
i
need
money
but
god
knows
i
am
not
poor
enough
or
shabby
enough
to
be
an
accessory
to
the
punishing
of
a
man
ancestor
for
crimes
committed
by
that
ancestor
but
colonel
implored
hawkins
stop
and
think
do
be
rash
you
know
it
the
only
chance
we
got
to
get
the
money
and
besides
the
bible
itself
says
posterity
to
the
fourth
generation
shall
be
punished
for
the
sins
and
crimes
committed
by
ancestors
four
generations
back
that
had
anything
to
do
with
them
and
so
it
only
fair
to
turn
the
rule
around
and
make
it
work
both
the
colonel
was
struck
with
the
strong
logic
of
this
position
he
strode
up
and
down
and
thought
it
painfully
over
finally
he
said
there
reason
in
it
yes
there
reason
in
it
and
so
although
it
seems
a
piteous
thing
to
sweat
this
poor
ancient
devil
for
a
burglary
he
had
the
least
hand
in
still
if
duty
commands
i
suppose
we
must
give
him
up
to
the
i
would
said
hawkins
cheered
and
relieved
i
give
him
up
if
he
was
a
thousand
ancestors
compacted
into
lord
bless
me
that
just
what
he
is
said
sellers
with
something
like
a
groan
it
exactly
what
he
is
there
a
contribution
in
him
from
every
ancestor
he
ever
had
in
him
there
atoms
of
priests
soldiers
crusaders
poets
and
sweet
and
gracious
women
all
kinds
and
conditions
of
folk
who
trod
this
earth
in
old
old
centuries
and
vanished
out
of
it
ages
ago
and
now
by
act
of
ours
they
are
summoned
from
their
holy
peace
to
answer
for
gutting
a
bank
away
out
on
the
borders
of
cherokee
strip
and
it
just
a
howling
outrage
oh
do
talk
like
that
colonel
it
takes
the
heart
all
out
of
me
and
makes
me
ashamed
of
the
part
i
am
proposing
to
wait
i
got
it
a
saving
hope
shout
it
out
i
am
it
perfectly
simple
a
child
would
have
thought
of
it
he
is
all
right
not
a
flaw
in
him
as
far
as
i
have
carried
the
work
if
been
able
to
bring
him
as
far
as
the
beginning
of
this
century
to
stop
me
now
i
go
on
and
materialize
him
down
to
land
i
never
thought
of
that
said
hawkins
all
ablaze
with
joy
again
it
the
very
thing
what
a
brain
you
have
got
and
will
he
shed
the
superfluous
arm
he
and
lose
his
english
accent
it
will
wholly
disappear
he
will
speak
cherokee
strip
and
other
forms
of
colonel
maybe
he
confess
confess
merely
that
bank
robbery
merely
yes
but
why
the
colonel
said
in
his
most
impressive
manner
hawkins
he
will
be
wholly
under
my
command
i
will
make
him
confess
every
crime
he
ever
committed
there
must
be
a
thousand
do
you
get
the
idea
well
not
the
rewards
will
come
to
prodigious
conception
i
never
saw
such
a
head
for
seeing
with
a
lightning
glance
all
the
outlying
ramifications
and
possibilities
of
a
central
it
is
nothing
it
comes
natural
to
me
when
his
time
is
out
in
one
jail
he
goes
to
the
next
and
the
next
and
we
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
collect
the
rewards
as
he
goes
along
it
is
a
perfectly
steady
income
as
long
as
we
live
hawkins
and
much
better
than
other
kinds
of
investments
because
he
is
it
looks
it
really
does
look
the
way
you
say
it
does
look
why
it
is
it
will
not
be
denied
that
i
have
had
a
pretty
wide
and
comprehensive
financial
experience
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
i
consider
this
one
of
the
most
valuable
properties
i
have
ever
do
you
really
think
so
i
do
o
colonel
the
wasting
grind
and
grief
of
poverty
if
we
could
realize
immediately
i
do
mean
sell
it
all
but
sell
part
enough
you
know
to
see
how
you
tremble
with
excitement
that
comes
of
lack
of
experience
my
boy
when
you
have
been
familiar
with
vast
operations
as
long
as
i
have
you
be
different
look
at
me
is
my
eye
dilated
do
you
notice
a
quiver
anywhere
feel
my
pulse
same
as
if
i
were
asleep
and
yet
what
is
passing
through
my
calm
cold
mind
a
procession
of
figures
which
would
make
a
financial
novice
drunk
just
the
sight
of
them
now
it
is
by
keeping
cool
and
looking
at
a
thing
all
around
that
a
man
sees
what
really
in
it
and
saves
himself
from
the
unfailing
mistake
the
one
you
just
suggested
eagerness
to
realize
listen
to
me
your
idea
is
to
sell
a
part
of
him
for
ready
cash
now
mine
is
i
have
an
idea
what
is
it
stock
him
of
well
i
should
never
have
thought
of
because
you
are
not
a
financier
say
he
has
committed
a
thousand
crimes
certainly
that
a
low
estimate
by
the
look
of
him
even
in
his
unfinished
condition
he
has
committed
all
of
a
million
but
call
it
only
a
thousand
to
be
perfectly
safe
five
thousand
reward
multiplied
by
a
thousand
gives
us
a
dead
sure
cash
basis
of
what
five
million
dollars
wait
let
me
get
my
and
the
property
indestructible
perpetually
fruitful
perpetually
for
a
property
with
his
disposition
will
go
on
committing
crimes
and
winning
you
daze
me
you
make
my
head
whirl
let
it
whirl
it
wo
do
it
any
harm
now
that
matter
is
all
fixed
leave
it
alone
i
get
up
the
company
and
issue
the
stock
all
in
good
time
just
leave
it
in
my
hands
i
judge
you
do
doubt
my
ability
to
work
it
up
for
all
it
is
indeed
i
do
i
can
say
that
with
all
right
then
that
disposed
of
everything
in
its
turn
we
old
operators
go
by
order
and
system
no
business
with
us
what
the
next
thing
on
the
docket
the
carrying
on
of
the
materialization
the
bringing
it
down
to
date
i
will
begin
on
that
at
once
i
think
look
here
rossmore
you
did
lock
it
in
a
hundred
to
one
it
has
escaped
calm
yourself
as
to
that
do
give
yourself
any
but
why
should
it
escape
let
it
if
it
wants
to
what
of
it
well
i
should
consider
it
a
pretty
serious
why
my
dear
boy
once
in
my
power
always
in
my
power
it
may
go
and
come
freely
i
can
produce
it
here
whenever
i
want
it
just
by
the
exercise
of
my
well
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
that
i
do
assure
yes
i
shall
give
it
all
the
painting
it
wants
to
do
and
we
and
the
family
will
make
it
as
comfortable
and
contented
as
we
can
no
occasion
to
restrain
its
movements
i
hope
to
persuade
it
to
remain
pretty
quiet
though
because
a
materialization
which
is
in
a
state
of
arrested
development
must
of
necessity
be
pretty
soft
and
flabby
and
substanceless
and
er
by
the
way
i
wonder
where
it
comes
from
how
what
do
you
mean
the
earl
pointed
significantly
and
interrogatively
toward
the
sky
hawkins
started
then
settled
into
deep
reflection
finally
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
and
pointed
downwards
what
makes
you
think
so
washington
well
i
hardly
know
but
really
you
can
see
yourself
that
he
seem
to
be
pining
for
his
last
it
well
thought
soundly
deduced
we
done
that
thing
a
favor
but
i
believe
i
will
pump
it
a
little
in
a
quiet
way
and
find
out
if
we
are
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
to
finish
him
off
and
fetch
him
down
to
date
colonel
i
wish
i
knew
but
i
do
i
am
clear
knocked
out
by
this
new
detail
this
unforeseen
necessity
of
working
a
subject
down
gradually
from
his
condition
of
ancestor
to
his
ultimate
result
as
posterity
but
i
make
him
hump
himself
rossmore
yes
dear
we
in
the
laboratory
come
hawkins
is
here
mind
now
hawkins
he
a
sound
living
human
being
to
all
the
family
forget
that
here
she
keep
your
seats
i
not
coming
in
i
just
wanted
to
ask
who
is
it
that
painting
down
there
that
oh
that
a
young
artist
young
englishman
named
tracy
very
promising
favorite
pupil
of
hans
christian
andersen
or
one
of
the
other
old
masters
andersen
i
pretty
sure
it
is
he
going
to
some
of
our
old
italian
masterpieces
been
talking
to
him
well
only
a
word
i
stumbled
right
in
on
him
without
expecting
anybody
was
there
i
tried
to
be
polite
to
him
offered
him
a
snack
sellers
delivered
a
large
wink
to
hawkins
from
behind
his
hand
but
he
declined
and
said
he
was
hungry
another
sarcastic
wink
so
i
brought
some
apples
doublewink
and
he
ate
a
couple
of
what
and
the
colonel
sprang
some
yards
toward
the
ceiling
and
came
down
quaking
with
astonishment
lady
rossmore
was
smitten
dumb
with
amazement
she
gazed
at
the
sheepish
relic
of
cherokee
strip
then
at
her
husband
and
then
at
the
guest
again
finally
she
said
what
is
the
matter
with
you
mulberry
he
did
not
answer
immediately
his
back
was
turned
he
was
bending
over
his
chair
feeling
the
seat
of
it
but
he
answered
next
moment
and
said
ah
there
it
is
it
was
a
the
lady
contemplated
him
doubtfully
a
moment
then
said
pretty
snappishly
all
that
for
a
tack
praise
goodness
it
was
a
shingle
nail
it
would
have
landed
you
in
the
milky
way
i
do
hate
to
have
my
nerves
shook
up
and
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
went
her
way
as
soon
as
she
was
safely
out
the
colonel
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
come
we
must
see
for
ourselves
it
must
be
a
they
hurried
softly
down
and
peeped
in
sellers
whispered
in
a
sort
of
despair
it
is
eating
what
a
grisly
spectacle
hawkins
it
horrible
take
me
away
i
ca
stand
it
they
tottered
back
to
the
laboratory
chapter
xx
tracy
made
slow
progress
with
his
work
for
his
mind
wandered
a
good
deal
many
things
were
puzzling
him
finally
a
light
burst
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
to
at
any
rate
and
he
said
to
himself
i
got
the
clew
at
last
this
man
mind
is
off
its
balance
i
do
know
how
much
but
it
off
a
point
or
two
sure
off
enough
to
explain
this
mess
of
perplexities
anyway
these
dreadful
chromos
which
he
takes
for
old
masters
these
villainous
portraits
which
to
his
frantic
mind
represent
rossmores
the
hatchments
the
pompous
name
of
this
ramshackle
old
crib
rossmore
towers
and
that
odd
assertion
of
his
that
i
was
expected
how
could
i
be
expected
that
is
lord
berkeley
he
knows
by
the
papers
that
that
person
was
burned
up
in
the
new
gadsby
why
hang
it
he
really
does
know
who
he
was
expecting
for
his
talk
showed
that
he
was
not
expecting
an
englishman
or
yet
an
artist
yet
i
answer
his
requirements
notwithstanding
he
seems
sufficiently
satisfied
with
me
yes
he
is
a
little
off
in
fact
i
am
afraid
he
is
a
good
deal
off
poor
old
gentleman
but
he
interesting
all
people
in
about
his
condition
are
i
suppose
i
hope
he
like
my
work
i
would
like
to
come
every
day
and
study
him
and
when
i
write
my
father
ah
that
hurts
i
must
get
on
that
subject
it
is
good
for
my
spirits
somebody
coming
i
must
get
to
work
it
the
old
gentleman
again
he
looks
bothered
maybe
my
clothes
are
suspicious
and
they
are
for
an
artist
if
my
conscience
would
allow
me
to
make
a
change
but
that
is
out
of
the
question
i
wonder
what
he
making
those
passes
in
the
air
for
with
his
hands
i
seem
to
be
the
object
of
them
can
he
be
trying
to
mesmerize
me
i
do
quite
like
it
there
something
uncanny
about
the
colonel
muttered
to
himself
it
has
an
effect
on
him
i
can
see
it
myself
that
enough
for
one
time
i
reckon
he
not
very
solid
yet
i
suppose
and
i
might
disintegrate
him
i
just
put
a
sly
question
or
two
at
him
now
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
what
his
condition
is
and
where
he
he
approached
and
said
affably
do
let
me
disturb
you
tracy
i
only
want
to
take
a
little
glimpse
of
your
work
ah
that
fine
that
very
fine
indeed
you
are
doing
it
elegantly
my
daughter
will
be
charmed
with
this
may
i
sit
down
by
you
oh
do
i
shall
be
it
wo
disturb
you
i
mean
wo
dissipate
your
inspirations
tracy
laughed
and
said
they
were
not
ethereal
enough
to
be
very
easily
discommoded
the
colonel
asked
a
number
of
cautious
and
questions
questions
which
seemed
pretty
odd
and
flighty
to
tracy
but
the
answers
conveyed
the
information
desired
apparently
for
the
colonel
said
to
himself
with
mixed
pride
and
gratification
it
a
good
job
as
far
as
i
got
with
it
he
solid
solid
and
going
to
last
solid
as
the
real
it
wonderful
wonderful
i
believe
i
could
petrify
after
a
little
he
asked
warily
do
you
prefer
being
here
or
or
there
there
where
why
er
where
you
been
tracy
thought
flew
to
his
and
he
answered
with
decision
oh
here
much
the
colonel
was
startled
and
said
to
himself
there
no
uncertain
ring
about
that
it
indicates
where
he
been
to
poor
fellow
well
i
am
satisfied
now
i
glad
i
got
him
he
sat
thinking
and
thinking
and
watching
the
brush
go
at
length
he
said
to
himself
yes
it
certainly
seems
to
account
for
the
failure
of
my
endeavors
in
poor
berkeley
case
he
went
in
the
other
direction
well
it
all
right
he

sellers
entered
from

looking

divinest
and
the
artist
was
introduced
to
her
it
was
a
violent
case
of
mutual
love
at
first
sight
though
neither
party
was
entirely
aware
of
the
fact
perhaps
the
englishman
made
this
irrelevant
remark
to
himself
perhaps
he
is
not
insane
after
sally
sat
down
and
showed
an
interest
in
tracy
work
which
greatly
pleased
him
and
a
benevolent
forgiveness
of
it
which
convinced
him
that
the
girl
nature
was
cast
in
a
large
mould
sellers
was
anxious
to
report
his
discoveries
to
hawkins
so
he
took
his
leave
saying
that
if
the
two
young
devotees
of
the
colored
muse
thought
they
could
manage
without
him
he
would
go
and
look
after
his
affairs
the
artist
said
to
himself
i
think
he
is
a
little
eccentric
perhaps
but
that
is
he
reproached
himself
for
having
injuriously
judged
a
man
without
giving
him
any
fair
chance
to
show
what
he
really
was
of
course
the
stranger
was
very
soon
at
his
ease
and
chatting
along
comfortably
the
average
american
girl
possesses
the
valuable
qualities
of
naturalness
honesty
and
inoffensive
straightforwardness
she
is
nearly
barren
of
troublesome
conventions
and
artificialities
consequently
her
presence
and
her
ways
are
unembarrassing
and
one
is
acquainted
with
her
and
on
the
pleasantest
terms
with
her
before
he
knows
how
it
came
about
this
new
acquaintanceship
friendship
indeed
progressed
swiftly
and
the
unusual
swiftness
of
it
and
the
thoroughness
of
it
are
sufficiently
evidenced
and
established
by
one
noteworthy
fact
that
within
the
first
half
hour
both
parties
had
ceased
to
be
conscious
of
tracy
clothes
later
this
consciousness
was
it
was
then
apparent
to
gwendolen
that
she
was
almost
reconciled
to
them
and
it
was
apparent
to
tracy
that
he
was
the
was
brought
about
by
gwendolen
inviting
the
artist
to
stay
to
dinner
he
had
to
decline
because
he
wanted
to
live
now
that
is
now
that
there
was
something
to
live
for
and
he
could
not
survive
in
those
clothes
at
a
gentleman
table
he
thought
he
knew
that
but
he
went
away
happy
for
he
saw
that
gwendolen
was
disappointed
and
whither
did
he
go
he
went
straight
to
a
slopshop
and
bought
as
neat
and
reasonably
a
suit
of
clothes
as
an
englishman
could
be
persuaded
to
wear
he
said
to
himself
but
at
his
conscience
i
know
it
wrong
but
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
do
it
and
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
this
satisfied
him
and
made
his
heart
light
perhaps
it
will
also
satisfy
the
reader
if
he
can
make
out
what
it
means
the
old
people
were
troubled
about
gwendolen
at
dinner
because
she
was
so
distraught
and
silent
if
they
had
noticed
they
would
have
found
that
she
was
sufficiently
alert
and
interested
whenever
the
talk
stumbled
upon
the
artist
and
his
work
but
they
did
notice
and
so
the
chat
would
swap
around
to
some
other
subject
and
then
somebody
would
presently
be
privately
worrying
about
gwendolen
again
and
wondering
if
she
were
not
well
or
if
something
had
gone
wrong
in
the
millinery
line
her
mother
offered
her
various
reputable
patent
medicines
and
tonics
with
iron
and
other
hardware
in
them
and
her
father
even
proposed
to
send
out
for
wine
relentless
prohibitionist
and
head
of
the
order
in
the
district
of
columbia
as
he
was
but
these
kindnesses
were
all
declined
thankfully
but
with
decision
at
bedtime
when
the
family
were
breaking
up
for
the
night
she
privately
looted
one
of
the
brushes
saying
to
herself
it
the
one
he
has
used
the
the
next
morning
tracy
went
forth
wearing
his
new
suit
and
equipped
with
a
pink
in
his
a
daily
attention
from
puss
his
whole
soul
was
full
of
gwendolen
sellers
and
this
condition
was
an
inspiration
all
the
morning
his
brush
pawed
nimbly
away
at
the
canvases
almost
without
his
awarity
awarity
in
this
sense
being
the
sense
of
being
aware
though
disputed
by
some
authorities
turning
out
marvel
upon
marvel
in
the
way
of
decorative
accessories
to
the
portraits
with
a
felicity
and
celerity
which
amazed
the
veterans
of
the
firm
and
fetched
out
of
them
continuous
explosions
of
applause
meantime
gwendolen
was
losing
her
morning
and
many
dollars
she
supposed
tracy
was
coming
in
the
forenoon
a
conclusion
which
she
had
jumped
to
without
outside
help
so
she
tripped
down
stairs
every
little
while
from
her
to
arrange
the
brushes
and
things
over
again
and
see
if
he
had
arrived
and
when
she
was
in
her
it
was
not
profitable
but
just
the
other
way
as
she
found
out
to
her
sorrow
she
had
put
in
her
idle
moments
during
the
last
little
while
back
in
designing
a
particularly
rare
and
capable
gown
for
herself
and
this
morning
she
set
about
making
it
up
but
she
was
absent
minded
and
made
an
irremediable
botch
of
it
when
she
saw
what
she
had
done
she
knew
the
reason
of
it
and
the
meaning
of
it
and
she
put
her
work
away
from
her
and
said
she
would
accept
the
sign
and
from
that
time
forth
she
came
no
more
away
from
the
audience
chamber
but
remained
there
and
waited
after
luncheon
she
waited
again
a
whole
hour
then
a
great
joy
welled
up
in
her
heart
for
she
saw
him
coming
so
she
flew
back
up
stairs
thankful
and
could
hardly
wait
for
him
to
miss
the
principal
brush
which
she
had
mislaid
down
there
but
knew
where
she
had
mislaid
it
however
all
in
good
time
the
others
were
called
in
and
find
the
brush
and
then
she
was
sent
for
and
she
could
find
it
herself
for
some
little
time
but
then
she
found
it
when
the
others
had
gone
away
to
hunt
in
the
kitchen
and
down
cellar
and
in
the
woodshed
and
all
those
other
places
where
people
look
for
things
whose
ways
they
are
not
familiar
with
so
she
gave
him
the
brush
and
remarked
that
she
ought
to
have
seen
that
everything
was
ready
for
him
but
it
seemed
necessary
because
it
was
so
early
that
she
was
expecting
but
she
stopped
there
surprised
at
herself
for
what
she
was
saying
and
he
felt
caught
and
ashamed
and
said
to
himself
i
knew
my
impatience
would
drag
me
here
before
i
was
expected
and
betray
me
and
that
is
just
what
it
has
done
she
sees
straight
through
me
and
is
laughing
at
me
inside
of
gwendolen
was
very
much
pleased
on
one
account
and
a
little
the
other
way
in
another
pleased
with
the
new
clothes
and
the
improvement
which
they
had
achieved
less
pleased
by
the
pink
in
the
buttonhole
yesterday
pink
had
hardly
interested
her
this
one
was
just
like
it
but
somehow
it
had
got
her
immediate
attention
and
kept
it
she
wished
she
could
think
of
some
way
of
getting
at
its
history
in
a
properly
colorless
and
indifferent
way
presently
she
made
a
venture
she
said
whatever
a
man
age
may
be
he
can
reduce
it
several
years
by
putting
a
flower
in
his
i
have
often
noticed
that
is
that
your
sex
reason
for
wearing
a
boutonniere
i
fancy
not
but
certainly
that
reason
would
be
a
sufficient
one
never
heard
of
the
idea
you
seem
to
prefer
pinks
is
it
on
account
of
the
color
or
the
form
oh
no
he
said
simply
they
are
given
to
me
i
do
think
i
have
any
they
are
given
to
him
she
said
to
herself
and
she
felt
a
coldness
toward
that
pink
i
wonder
who
it
is
and
what
she
is
the
flower
began
to
take
up
a
good
deal
of
room
it
obtruded
itself
everywhere
it
intercepted
all
views
and
marred
them
it
was
becoming
exceedingly
annoying
and
conspicuous
for
a
little
thing
i
wonder
if
he
cares
for
that
thought
gave
her
a
quite
definite
pain
chapter
xxi
she
had
made
everything
comfortable
for
the
artist
there
was
no
further
pretext
for
staying
so
she
said
she
would
go
now
and
asked
him
to
summon
the
servants
in
case
he
should
need
anything
she
went
away
unhappy
and
she
left
unhappiness
behind
her
for
she
carried
away
all
the
sunshine
the
time
dragged
heavily
for
both
now
he
could
paint
for
thinking
of
her
she
could
design
or
millinerize
with
any
heart
for
thinking
of
him
never
before
had
painting
seemed
so
empty
to
him
never
before
had
millinerizing
seemed
so
void
of
interest
to
her
she
had
gone
without
repeating
that
an
almost
unendurable
disappointment
to
him
on
her
she
was
suffering
too
for
she
had
found
she
could
invite
him
it
was
not
hard
yesterday
but
it
was
impossible
a
thousand
innocent
privileges
seemed
to
have
been
filched
from
her
unawares
in
the
past
hours
she
felt
strangely
hampered
restrained
of
her
liberty
she
propose
to
herself
to
do
anything
or
say
anything
concerning
this
young
man
without
being
instantly
paralyzed
into
by
the
fear
that
he
might
invite
him
to
dinner
it
made
her
shiver
to
think
of
it
and
so
her
afternoon
was
one
long
fret
broken
at
intervals
three
times
she
had
to
go
down
stairs
on
errands
that
is
she
thought
she
had
to
go
down
stairs
on
errands
thus
going
and
coming
she
had
six
glimpses
of
him
in
the
aggregate
without
seeming
to
look
in
his
direction
and
she
tried
to
endure
these
electric
ecstasies
without
showing
any
sign
but
they
fluttered
her
up
a
good
deal
and
she
felt
that
the
naturalness
she
was
putting
on
was
overdone
and
quite
too
frantically
sober
and
hysterically
calm
to
deceive
the
painter
had
his
share
of
the
rapture
he
had
his
six
glimpses
and
they
smote
him
with
waves
of
pleasure
that
assaulted
him
beat
upon
him
washed
over
him
deliciously
and
drowned
out
all
consciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
with
his
brush
so
there
were
six
places
in
his
canvas
which
had
to
be
done
over
again
at
last
gwendolen
got
some
peace
of
mind
by
sending
word
to
the
thompsons
in
the
neighborhood
that
she
was
coming
there
to
dinner
she
would
be
reminded
at
that
table
that
there
was
an
absentee
who
ought
to
be
a
presentee
a
word
which
she
meant
to
look
out
in
the
dictionary
at
a
calmer
time
about
this
time
the
old
earl
dropped
in
for
a
chat
with
the
artist
and
invited
him
to
stay
to
dinner
tracy
cramped
down
his
joy
and
gratitude
by
a
sudden
and
powerful
exercise
of
all
his
forces
and
he
felt
that
now
that
he
was
going
to
be
close
to
gwendolen
and
hear
her
voice
and
watch
her
face
during
several
precious
hours
earth
had
nothing
valuable
to
add
to
his
life
for
the
present
the
earl
said
to
himself
this
spectre
can
eat
apples
apparently
we
shall
find
out
now
if
that
is
a
specialty
i
think
myself
it
a
specialty
apples
without
doubt
constitute
the
spectral
limit
it
was
the
case
with
our
first
parents
no
i
am
wrong
at
least
only
partly
right
the
line
was
drawn
at
apples
just
as
in
the
present
case
but
it
was
from
the
other
the
new
clothes
gave
him
a
thrill
of
pleasure
and
pride
he
said
to
himself
i
got
part
of
him
down
to
date
sellers
said
he
was
pleased
with
tracy
work
and
he
went
on
and
engaged
him
to
restore
his
old
masters
and
said
he
should
also
want
him
to
paint
his
portrait
and
his
wife
and
possibly
his
daughter
the
tide
of
the
artist
happiness
was
at
flood
now
the
chat
flowed
pleasantly
along
while
tracy
painted
and
sellers
carefully
unpacked
a
picture
which
he
had
brought
with
him
it
was
a
chromo
a
new
one
just
out
it
was
the
smirking
portrait
of
a
man
who
was
inundating
the
union
with
advertisements
inviting
everybody
to
buy
his
specialty
which
was
a
shoe
or
a
or
something
of
that
kind
the
old
gentleman
rested
the
chromo
flat
upon
his
lap
and
gazed
down
tenderly
upon
it
and
became
silent
and
meditative
presently
tracy
noticed
that
he
was
dripping
tears
on
it
this
touched
the
young
fellow
sympathetic
nature
and
at
the
same
time
gave
him
the
painful
sense
of
being
an
intruder
upon
a
sacred
privacy
an
observer
of
emotions
which
a
stranger
ought
not
to
witness
but
his
pity
rose
superior
to
other
considerations
and
compelled
him
to
try
to
comfort
the
old
mourner
with
kindly
words
and
a
show
of
friendly
interest
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
is
it
a
friend
whom
ah
more
than
that
far
more
than
that
a
relative
the
dearest
i
had
on
earth
although
i
was
never
permitted
to
see
him
yes
it
is
young
lord
berkeley
who
perished
so
heroically
in
the
awful
conflagration
why
what
is
the
matter
oh
nothing
it
was
a
little
startling
to
be
so
suddenly
brought
face
to
face
so
to
speak
with
a
person
one
has
heard
so
much
talk
about
is
it
a
good
likeness
without
doubt
yes
i
never
saw
him
but
you
can
easily
see
the
resemblance
to
his
father
said
sellers
holding
up
the
chromo
and
glancing
from
it
to
the
chromo
misrepresenting
the
usurping
earl
and
back
again
with
an
approving
eye
well
no
i
am
not
sure
that
i
make
out
the
likeness
it
is
plain
that
the
usurping
earl
there
has
a
great
deal
of
character
and
a
long
face
like
a
horse
whereas
his
heir
here
is
smirky
and
we
are
all
that
way
in
the
beginning
all
the
line
said
sellers
undisturbed
we
all
start
as
moonfaced
fools
then
later
we
tadpole
along
into
marvels
of
intellect
and
character
it
is
by
that
sign
and
by
that
fact
that
i
detect
the
resemblance
here
and
know
this
portrait
to
be
genuine
and
perfect
yes
all
our
family
are
fools
at
this
young
man
seems
to
meet
the
hereditary
requirement
yes
yes
he
was
a
fool
without
any
doubt
examine
the
face
the
shape
of
the
head
the
expression
it
all
fool
fool
fool
straight
thanks
said
tracy
involuntarily
thanks
i
mean
for
explaining
it
to
me
go
on
as
i
was
saying
fool
is
printed
all
over
the
face
a
body
can
even
read
the
what
do
they
say
well
added
up
he
is
a
a
which
wobbler
a
person
that
always
taking
a
firm
stand
about
something
or
other
kind
of
a
gibraltar
stand
he
thinks
for
unshakable
fidelity
and
everlastingness
and
then
inside
of
a
little
while
he
begins
to
wobble
no
more
gibraltar
there
no
sir
a
mighty
ordinary
commonplace
weakling
wobbling
around
on
stilts
that
lord
berkeley
to
a
dot
you
can
see
it
look
at
that
sheep
but
why
are
you
blushing
like
sunset
dear
sir
have
i
unwittingly
offended
in
some
way
oh
no
indeed
no
indeed
far
from
it
but
it
always
makes
me
blush
to
hear
a
man
revile
his
own
he
said
to
himself
how
strangely
his
vagrant
and
unguided
fancies
have
hit
upon
the
truth
by
accident
he
has
described
me
i
am
that
contemptible
thing
when
i
left
england
i
thought
i
knew
myself
i
thought
i
was
a
very
frederick
the
great
for
resolution
and
staying
capacity
whereas
in
truth
i
am
just
a
wobbler
simply
a
wobbler
well
after
all
it
is
at
least
creditable
to
have
high
ideals
and
give
birth
to
lofty
resolutions
i
will
allow
myself
that
then
he
said
aloud
could
this
sheep
as
you
call
him
breed
a
great
and
idea
in
his
head
do
you
think
could
he
meditate
such
a
thing
for
instance
as
the
renunciation
of
the
earldom
and
its
wealth
and
its
glories
and
voluntary
retirement
to
the
ranks
of
the
commonalty
there
to
rise
by
his
own
merit
or
remain
forever
poor
and
obscure
could
he
why
look
at
him
look
at
this
simpering
mug
there
is
your
answer
it
the
very
thing
he
would
think
of
and
he
would
start
in
to
do
it
and
then
he
and
back
down
every
is
that
to
happen
with
all
my
i
mean
would
that
happen
to
all
his
high
resolutions
oh
certainly
certainly
it
the
rossmore
of
then
this
creature
was
fortunate
to
die
suppose
for
argument
sake
that
i
was
a
rossmore
and
it
ca
be
why
because
it
not
a
supposable
case
to
be
a
rossmore
at
your
age
you
have
to
be
a
fool
and
you
not
a
fool
and
you
have
to
be
a
wobbler
whereas
anybody
that
is
an
expert
in
reading
character
can
see
at
a
glance
that
when
you
set
your
foot
down
once
it
there
to
stay
and
earthquake
ca
wobble
he
added
to
himself
that
enough
to
say
to
him
but
it
is
half
strong
enough
for
the
facts
the
more
i
observe
him
now
the
more
remarkable
i
find
him
it
is
the
strongest
face
i
have
ever
examined
there
is
almost
superhuman
firmness
here
immovable
purpose
iron
steadfastness
of
will
a
most
extraordinary
young
he
presently
said
aloud
some
time
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
about
a
little
matter
tracy
you
see
i
got
that
young
lord
remains
my
goodness
how
you
jump
oh
it
nothing
pray
go
on
you
got
his
remains

you
sure
they
are
his
and
not
somebody
else
oh
perfectly
sure
samples
i
mean
not
all
of
samples
yes
in
baskets
some
time
you
will
be
going
home
and
if
you
mind
taking
them
along
who
i
yes
certainly
i
do
mean
now
but
after
a
while
after
but
look
here
would
you
like
to
see
them
no
most
certainly
not
i
do
want
to
see
o
very
well
i
only
thought
hey
where
are
you
going
dear
out
to
dinner
tracy
was
aghast
the
colonel
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
well
i
sorry
sho
i
did
know
she
was
going
out
gwendolen
face
began
to
take
on
a
sort
of
apprehensive
expression
three
old
people
to
one
young
one
well
it
is
a
good
team
that
a
gwendolen
face
betrayed
a
dawning
hopefulness
and
she
said
with
a
tone
of
reluctance
which
had
the
on
it
if
you
prefer
i
will
send
word
to
the
thompsons
that
i
oh
is
it
the
thompsons
that
simplifies
it
sets
everything
right
we
can
fix
it
without
spoiling
your
arrangements
my
child
you
got
your
heart
set
on
but
papa
i
just
as
soon
go
there
some
other
no
i
wo
have
it
you
are
a
good
darling
child
and
your
father
is
not
the
man
to
disappoint
you
when
you
but
papa
i
go
along
i
wo
hear
a
word
we
get
along
gwendolen
was
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
start
which
she
was
about
to
do
when
her
father
hit
upon
an
idea
which
filled
him
with
delight
because
it
so
deftly
covered
all
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
and
made
things
smooth
and
satisfactory
i
got
it
my
love
so
that
you
wo
be
robbed
of
your
holiday
and
at
the
same
time
we
be
pretty
satisfactorily
fixed
for
a
good
time
here
you
send
belle
thompson
here
perfectly
beautiful
creature
tracy
perfectly
beautiful
i
want
you
to
see
that
girl
why
you
just
go
mad
you
go
mad
inside
of
a
minute
yes
you
send
her
right
along
gwendolen
and
tell
her
why
she
gone
he
turned
she
was
already
passing
out
at
the
gate
he
muttered
i
wonder
what
the
matter
i
do
know
what
her
mouth
doing
but
i
think
her
shoulders
are
swearing
well
said
sellers
blithely
to
tracy
i
shall
miss
her
parents
always
miss
the
children
as
soon
as
they
out
of
sight
it
only
a
natural
and
wisely
ordained
partiality
but
you
be
all
right
because
miss
belle
will
supply
the
youthful
element
for
you
and
to
your
entire
content
and
we
old
people
will
do
our
best
too
we
shall
have
a
good
enough
time
and
you
have
a
chance
to
get
better
acquainted
with
admiral
hawkins
that
a
rare
character
tracy
one
of
the
rarest
and
most
engaging
characters
the
world
has
produced
you
find
him
worth
studying
i
studied
him
ever
since
he
was
a
child
and
have
always
found
him
developing
i
really
consider
that
one
of
the
main
things
that
have
enabled
me
to
master
the
difficult
science
of
was
the
vivid
interest
i
always
felt
in
that
boy
and
the
baffling
inscrutabilities
of
his
ways
and
tracy
was
not
hearing
a
word
his
spirits
were
gone
he
was
desolate
yes
a
most
wonderful
character
concealment
that
the
basis
of
it
always
the
first
thing
you
want
to
do
is
to
find
the
keystone
a
character
is
built
on
then
you
got
it
no
misleading
and
apparently
inconsistent
peculiarities
can
fool
you
then
what
do
you
read
on
the
senator
surface
simplicity
a
kind
of
rank
and
protuberant
simplicity
whereas
in
fact
that
one
of
the
deepest
minds
in
the
world
a
perfectly
honest
man
an
absolutely
honest
and
honorable
man
and
yet
without
doubt
the
profoundest
master
of
dissimulation
the
world
has
ever
o
it
devilish
this
was
wrung
from
the
unlistening
tracy
by
the
anguished
thought
of
what
might
have
been
if
only
the
dinner
arrangements
had
got
mixed
no
i
should
call
it
that
said
sellers
who
was
now
placidly
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
under
his
and
listening
to
himself
talk
one
could
quite
properly
call
it
devilish
in
another
man
but
not
in
the
senator
your
term
is
right
perfectly
right
i
grant
that
but
the
application
is
wrong
it
makes
a
great
difference
yes
he
is
a
marvelous
character
i
do
not
suppose
that
any
other
statesman
ever
had
such
a
colossal
sense
of
humor
combined
with
the
ability
to
totally
conceal
it
i
may
except
george
washington
and
cromwell
and
perhaps
robespierre
but
i
draw
the
line
there
a
person
not
an
expert
might
be
in
judge
hawkins
company
a
lifetime
and
never
find
out
he
had
any
more
sense
of
humor
than
a
a
sigh
from
the
distraught
and
dreaming
artist
followed
by
a
murmured
miserable
oh
miserable
well
no
i
should
say
that
about
it
quite
on
the
contrary
i
admire
his
ability
to
conceal
his
humor
even
more
if
possible
than
i
admire
the
gift
itself
stupendous
as
it
is
another
thing
general
hawkins
is
a
thinker
a
keen
logical
exhaustive
analytical
thinker
perhaps
the
ablest
of
modern
times
that
is
of
course
upon
themes
suited
to
his
size
like
the
glacial
period
and
the
correlation
of
forces
and
the
evolution
of
the
christian
from
the
caterpillar
any
of
those
things
give
him
a
subject
according
to
his
size
and
just
stand
back
and
watch
him
think
why
you
can
see
the
place
rock
ah
yes
you
must
know
him
you
must
get
on
the
inside
of
him
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
mind
since
dinner
was
kept
waiting
for
a
while
for
miss
thompson
but
as
gwendolen
had
not
delivered
the
invitation
to
her
the
waiting
did
no
good
and
the
household
presently
went
to
the
meal
without
her
poor
old
sellers
tried
everything
his
hospitable
soul
could
devise
to
make
the
occasion
an
enjoyable
one
for
the
guest
and
the
guest
tried
his
honest
best
to
be
cheery
and
chatty
and
happy
for
the
old
gentleman
sake
in
fact
all
hands
worked
hard
in
the
interest
of
a
mutual
good
time
but
the
thing
was
a
failure
from
the
start
tracy
heart
was
lead
in
his
bosom
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
prominent
feature
in
the
landscape
and
that
was
a
vacant
chair
he
could
drag
his
mind
away
from
gwendolen
and
his
hard
luck
consequently
his
distractions
allowed
deadly
pauses
to
slip
in
every
now
and
then
when
it
was
his
turn
to
say
something
and
of
course
this
disease
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
conversation
wherefore
instead
of
having
a
breezy
sail
in
sunny
waters
as
anticipated
everybody
was
bailing
out
and
praying
for
land
what
could
the
matter
be
tracy
alone
could
have
told
the
others
could
even
invent
a
theory
meanwhile
they
were
having
a
similarly
dismal
time
at
the
thompson
house
in
fact
a
twin
experience
gwendolen
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
allowing
her
disappointment
to
so
depress
her
spirits
and
make
her
so
strangely
and
profoundly
miserable
but
feeling
ashamed
of
herself
did
improve
the
matter
any
it
only
seemed
to
aggravate
the
suffering
she
explained
that
she
was
not
feeling
very
well
and
everybody
could
see
that
this
was
true
so
she
got
sincere
sympathy
and
commiseration
but
that
did
help
the
case
nothing
helps
that
kind
of
a
case
it
is
best
to
just
stand
off
and
let
it
fester
the
moment
the
dinner
was
over
the
girl
excused
herself
and
she
hurried
home
feeling
unspeakably
grateful
to
get
away
from
that
house
and
that
intolerable
captivity
and
suffering
will
he
be
gone
the
thought
arose
in
her
brain
but
took
effect
in
her
heels
she
slipped
into
the
house
threw
off
her
things
and
made
straight
for
the
dining
room
she
stopped
and
listened
her
voice
with
no
life
in
it
presently
her
mother
no
life
in
that
a
considerable
vacancy
then
a
sterile
remark
from
washington
hawkins
another
silence
then
not
tracy
but
her
father
voice
again
he
gone
she
said
to
herself
despairingly
and
listlessly
opened
the
door
and
stepped
within
why
my
child
cried
the
mother
how
white
you
are
are
you
has
anything
white
exclaimed
sellers
it
gone
like
a
flash
was
serious
already
she
as
red
as
the
soul
of
a
watermelon
sit
down
dear
sit
down
goodness
knows
you
welcome
did
you
have
a
good
time
we
had
great
times
here
immense
why
did
miss
belle
come
tracy
is
not
feeling
well
and
she
have
made
him
forget
she
was
content
now
and
out
from
her
happy
eyes
there
went
a
light
that
told
a
secret
to
another
pair
of
eyes
there
and
got
a
secret
in
return
in
just
that
infinitely
small
fraction
of
a
second
those
two
great
confessions
were
made
received
and
perfectly
understood
all
anxiety
apprehension
uncertainty
vanished
out
of
these
young
people
hearts
and
left
them
filled
with
a
great
peace
sellers
had
had
the
most
confident
faith
that
with
the
new
reinforcement
victory
would
be
at
this
last
moment
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
defeat
but
it
was
an
error
the
talk
was
as
stubbornly
disjointed
as
ever
he
was
proud
of
gwendolen
and
liked
to
show
her
off
even
against
miss
belle
thompson
and
here
had
been
a
great
opportunity
and
what
had
she
made
of
it
he
felt
a
good
deal
put
out
it
vexed
him
to
think
that
this
englishman
with
the
traveling
briton
everlasting
disposition
to
generalize
whole
mountain
ranges
from
single
of
sand
would
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
american
girls
were
as
dumb
as
himself
generalizing
the
whole
tribe
from
this
single
sample
and
she
at
her
poorest
there
being
nothing
at
that
table
to
inspire
her
give
her
a
start
keep
her
from
going
to
sleep
he
made
up
his
mind
that
for
the
honor
of
the
country
he
would
bring
these
two
together
again
over
the
social
board
before
long
there
would
be
a
different
result
another
time
he
judged
he
said
to
himself
with
a
deep
sense
of
injury
put
in
his
diary
they
all
keep
diaries
he
put
in
his
diary
that
she
was
miraculously
uninteresting
dear
dear
but
was
she
i
never
saw
the
like
and
yet
looking
as
beautiful
as
satan
too
and
could
seem
to
do
anything
but
paw
bread
crumbs
and
pick
flowers
to
pieces
and
look
fidgety
and
it
is
any
better
here
in
the
hall
of
audience
had
enough
i
haul
down
my
flag
the
others
may
fight
it
out
if
they
want
he
shook
hands
all
around
and
went
off
to
do
some
work
which
he
said
was
pressing
the
idolaters
were
the
width
of
the
room
apart
and
apparently
unconscious
of
each
other
presence
the
distance
got
shortened
a
little
now
very
soon
the
mother
withdrew
the
distance
narrowed
again
tracy
stood
before
a
chromo
of
some
ohio
politician
which
had
been
retouched
and
for
a
crusading
rossmore
and
gwendolen
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
not
far
from
his
elbow
artificially
absorbed
in
examining
a
photograph
album
that
had
any
photographs
in
it
the
senator
still
lingered
he
was
sorry
for
the
young
people
it
had
been
a
dull
evening
for
them
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
he
tried
to
make
it
pleasant
for
them
now
tried
to
remove
the
ill
impression
necessarily
left
by
the
general
defeat
tried
to
be
chatty
even
tried
to
be
gay
but
the
responses
were
sickly
there
was
no
starting
any
enthusiasm
he
would
give
it
up
and
quit
it
was
a
day
specially
picked
out
and
consecrated
to
failures
but
when
gwendolen
rose
up
promptly
and
smiled
a
glad
smile
and
said
with
thankfulness
and
blessing
must
you
go
it
seemed
cruel
to
desert
and
he
sat
down
again
he
was
about
to
begin
a
remark
when
when
he
did
we
have
all
been
there
he
did
know
how
he
knew
his
concluding
to
stay
longer
had
been
a
mistake
he
merely
knew
it
and
knew
it
for
dead
certain
too
and
so
he
bade
goodnight
and
went
mooning
out
wondering
what
he
could
have
done
that
changed
the
atmosphere
that
way
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
those
two
were
standing
side
by
side
looking
at
that
door
looking
at
it
in
a
waiting
but
deeply
grateful
kind
of
way
and
the
instant
it
closed
they
flung
their
arms
about
each
other
necks
and
there
heart
to
heart
and
lip
to
lip
oh
my
god
she
kissing
it
nobody
heard
this
remark
because
hawkins
who
bred
it
only
thought
it
he
did
utter
it
he
had
turned
the
moment
he
had
closed
the
door
and
had
pushed
it
open
a
little
intending
to
and
ask
what
thing
he
had
done
or
said
and
apologize
for
it
but
he
did
he
staggered
off
stunned
terrified
distressed
chapter
xxii
five
minutes
later
he
was
sitting
in
his
room
with
his
head
bowed
within
the
circle
of
his
arms
on
the
table
final
attitude
of
grief
and
despair
his
tears
were
flowing
fast
and
now
and
then
a
sob
broke
upon
the
stillness
presently
he
said
i
knew
her
when
she
was
a
little
child
and
used
to
climb
about
my
knees
i
love
her
as
i
love
my
own
and
now
oh
poor
thing
poor
thing
i
can
not
bear
it
she
gone
and
lost
her
heart
to
this
mangy
materializee
why
did
we
see
that
that
might
happen
but
how
could
we
nobody
could
nobody
could
ever
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
you
could
expect
a
person
would
fall
in
love
with
a
and
this
one
does
even
amount
to
he
went
on
grieving
to
himself
and
now
and
then
giving
voice
to
his
lamentations
it
done
oh
it
done
and
there
no
help
for
it
no
undoing
the
miserable
business
if
i
had
the
nerve
i
would
kill
it
but
that
would
do
any
good
she
loves
it
she
thinks
it
genuine
and
authentic
if
she
lost
it
she
would
grieve
for
it
just
as
she
would
for
a
real
person
and
who
to
break
it
to
the
family
not
i
i
die
first
sellers
is
the
best
human
being
i
ever
knew
and
i
would
any
more
think
of
oh
dear
why
it
break
his
heart
when
he
finds
it
out
and
polly
too
this
comes
of
meddling
with
such
infernal
matters
but
for
this
the
creature
would
still
be
roasting
in
sheol
where
it
belongs
how
is
it
that
these
people
do
smell
the
brimstone
sometimes
i
ca
come
into
the
same
room
with
him
without
nearly
after
a
while
he
broke
out
again
well
there
one
thing
sure
the
materializing
has
got
to
stop
right
where
it
is
if
she
got
to
marry
a
spectre
let
her
marry
a
decent
one
out
of
the
middle
ages
like
this
one
not
a
cowboy
and
a
thief
such
as
this
protoplasmic
tadpole
going
to
turn
into
if
sellers
keeps
on
fussing
at
it
it
costs
five
thousand
dollars
cash
and
shuts
down
on
the
incorporated
company
to
stop
the
works
at
this
point
but
sally
sellers
happiness
is
worth
more
than
he
heard
sellers
coming
and
got
himself
to
rights
sellers
took
a
seat
and
said
well
i
got
to
confess
i
a
good
deal
puzzled
it
did
certainly
eat
there
no
getting
around
it
not
eat
exactly
either
but
it
nibbled
nibbled
in
an
appetiteless
way
but
still
it
nibbled
and
that
just
a
marvel
now
the
question
is
what
does
it
do
with
those
nibblings
that
it
what
does
it
do
with
them
my
idea
is
that
we
do
begin
to
know
all
there
is
to
this
stupendous
discovery
yet
but
time
will
show
time
and
science
give
us
a
chance
and
do
get
but
he
could
get
hawkins
interested
could
make
him
talk
to
amount
to
anything
could
drag
him
out
of
his
depression
but
at
last
he
took
a
turn
that
arrested
hawkins
attention
i
coming
to
like
him
hawkins
he
is
a
person
of
stupendous
character
absolutely
gigantic
under
that
placid
exterior
is
concealed
the
most
spirit
that
was
ever
put
into
a
man
he
just
a
clive
over
again
yes
i
all
admiration
for
him
on
account
of
his
character
and
liking
naturally
follows
admiration
you
know
i
coming
to
like
him
immensely
do
you
know
i
have
the
heart
to
degrade
such
a
character
as
that
down
to
the
burglar
estate
for
money
or
for
anything
else
and
i
come
to
ask
if
you
are
willing
to
let
the
reward
go
and
leave
this
poor
fellow
where
he
is
yes
not
bring
him
down
to
oh
there
my
hand
and
my
heart
in
it
too
i
never
forget
you
for
this
hawkins
said
the
old
gentleman
in
a
voice
which
he
found
it
hard
to
control
you
are
making
a
great
sacrifice
for
me
and
one
which
you
can
ill
afford
but
i
never
forget
your
generosity
and
if
i
live
you
shall
not
suffer
for
it
be
sure
of
sally
sellers
immediately
and
vividly
realized
that
she
was
become
a
new
being
a
being
of
a
far
higher
and
worthier
sort
than
she
had
been
such
a
little
while
before
an
earnest
being
in
place
of
a
dreamer
and
supplied
with
a
reason
for
her
presence
in
the
world
where
merely
a
wistful
and
troubled
curiosity
about
it
had
existed
before
so
great
and
so
comprehensive
was
the
change
which
had
been
wrought
that
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
a
real
person
who
had
lately
been
a
shadow
a
something
which
had
lately
been
a
nothing
a
purpose
which
had
lately
been
a
fancy
a
finished
temple
with
the
lit
and
the
voice
of
worship
ascending
where
before
had
been
but
an
architect
confusion
of
arid
working
plans
unintelligible
to
the
passing
eye
and
prophesying
nothing
lady
gwendolen
the
pleasantness
of
that
sound
was
all
gone
it
was
an
offense
to
her
ear
now
she
said
there
that
sham
belongs
to
the
past
i
will
not
be
called
by
it
any
i
may
call
you
simply
gwendolen
you
will
allow
me
to
drop
the
formalities
straightway
and
name
you
by
your
dear
first
name
without
additions
she
was
dethroning
the
pink
and
replacing
it
with
a
rosebud
there
that
is
better
i
hate
pinks
some
pinks
indeed
yes
you
are
to
call
me
by
my
first
name
without
additions
that
is
well
i
do
mean
without
additions
entirely
but
it
was
as
far
as
she
could
get
there
was
a
pause
his
intellect
was
struggling
to
comprehend
presently
it
did
manage
to
catch
the
idea
in
time
to
save
embarrassment
all
around
and
he
said
gratefully
dear
gwendolen
i
may
say
that
yes
part
of
it
but
do
kiss
me
when
i
am
talking
it
makes
me
forget
what
i
was
going
to
say
you
can
call
me
by
part
of
that
form
but
not
the
last
part
gwendolen
is
not
my
not
your
name
this
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
surprise
the
girl
soul
was
suddenly
invaded
by
a
creepy
apprehension
a
quite
definite
sense
of
suspicion
and
alarm
she
put
his
arms
away
from
her
looked
him
searchingly
in
the
eye
and
said
answer
me
truly
on
your
honor
you
are
not
seeking
to
marry
me
on
account
of
my
rank
the
shot
almost
knocked
him
through
the
wall
he
was
so
little
prepared
for
it
there
was
something
so
finely
grotesque
about
the
question
and
its
parent
suspicion
that
he
stopped
to
wonder
and
admire
and
thus
was
he
saved
from
laughing
then
without
wasting
precious
time
he
set
about
the
task
of
convincing
her
that
he
had
been
lured
by
herself
alone
and
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
only
not
her
title
and
position
that
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
and
could
not
love
her
more
if
she
were
a
duchess
or
less
if
she
were
without
home
name
or
family
she
watched
his
face
wistfully
eagerly
hopefully
translating
his
words
by
its
expression
and
when
he
had
finished
there
was
gladness
in
her
heart
a
tumultuous
gladness
indeed
though
outwardly
she
was
calm
tranquil
even
judicially
austere
she
prepared
a
surprise
for
him
now
calculated
to
put
a
heavy
strain
upon
those
disinterested
protestations
of
his
and
thus
she
delivered
it
burning
it
away
word
by
word
as
the
fuse
burns
down
to
a
bombshell
and
watching
to
see
how
far
the
explosion
would
lift
him
listen
and
do
not
doubt
me
for
i
shall
speak
the
exact
truth
howard
tracy
i
am
no
more
an
earl
child
than
you
are
to
her
joy
and
secret
surprise
also
it
never
phased
him
he
was
ready
this
time
and
saw
his
chance
he
cried
out
with
enthusiasm
thank
heaven
for
that
and
gathered
her
to
his
arms
to
express
her
happiness
was
almost
beyond
her
gift
of
speech
you
make
me
the
proudest
girl
in
all
the
earth
she
said
with
her
head
pillowed
on
his
shoulder
i
thought
it
only
natural
that
you
should
be
dazzled
by
the
title
maybe
even
unconsciously
you
being
english
and
that
you
might
be
deceiving
yourself
in
thinking
you
loved
only
me
and
find
you
did
love
me
when
the
deception
was
swept
away
so
it
makes
me
proud
that
the
revelation
stands
for
nothing
and
that
you
do
love
just
me
only
me
oh
prouder
than
any
words
can
tell
it
is
only
you
sweetheart
i
never
gave
one
envying
glance
toward
your
father
earldom
that
is
utterly
true
dear
there
you
must
call
me
that
i
hate
that
false
name
i
told
you
it
was
mine
my
name
is
sally
sellers
or
sarah
if
you
like
from
this
time
i
banish
dreams
visions
imaginings
and
will
no
more
of
them
i
am
going
to
be
myself
my
genuine
self
my
honest
self
my
natural
self
clear
and
clean
of
sham
and
folly
and
fraud
and
worthy
of
you
there
is
no
grain
of
social
inequality
between
us
i
like
you
am
poor
i
like
you
am
without
position
or
distinction
you
are
a
struggling
artist
i
am
that
too
in
my
humbler
way
our
bread
is
honest
bread
we
work
for
our
living
hand
in
hand
we
will
walk
hence
to
the
grave
helping
each
other
in
all
ways
living
for
each
other
being
and
remaining
one
in
heart
and
purpose
one
in
hope
and
aspiration
inseparable
to
the
end
and
though
our
place
is
low
judged
by
the
world
eye
we
will
make
it
as
high
as
the
highest
in
the
great
essentials
of
honest
work
for
what
we
eat
and
wear
and
conduct
above
reproach
we
live
in
a
land
let
us
be
thankful
where
this
is
and
no
man
is
better
than
his
neighbor
by
the
grace
of
god
but
only
by
his
own
tracy
tried
to
break
in
but
she
stopped
him
and
kept
the
floor
herself
i
am
not
through
yet
i
am
going
to
purge
myself
of
the
last
vestiges
of
artificiality
and
pretence
and
then
start
fair
on
your
own
honest
level
and
be
worthy
mate
to
you
thenceforth
my
father
honestly
thinks
he
is
an
earl
well
leave
him
his
dream
it
pleases
him
and
does
no
one
any
harm
it
was
the
dream
of
his
ancestors
before
him
it
has
made
fools
of
the
house
of
sellers
for
generations
and
it
made
something
of
a
fool
of
me
but
took
no
deep
root
i
am
done
with
it
now
and
for
good
hours
ago
i
was
privately
proud
of
being
the
daughter
of
a
pinchbeck
earl
and
thought
the
proper
mate
for
me
must
be
a
man
of
like
degree
but
oh
how
grateful
i
am
for
your
love
which
has
healed
my
sick
brain
and
restored
my
sanity
i
could
make
oath
that
no
earl
son
in
all
the
world
oh
well
but
but
why
you
look
like
a
person
in
a
panic
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
matter
oh
nothing
nothing
i
was
only
going
to
say
but
in
his
flurry
nothing
occurred
to
him
to
say
for
a
moment
then
by
a
lucky
inspiration
he
thought
of
something
entirely
sufficient
for
the
occasion
and
brought
it
out
with
eloquent
force
oh
how
beautiful
you
are
you
take
my
breath
away
when
you
look
like
it
was
well
conceived
well
timed
and
cordially
delivered
and
it
got
its
reward
let
me
see
where
was
i
yes
my
father
earldom
is
pure
moonshine
look
at
those
dreadful
things
on
the
wall
you
have
of
course
supposed
them
to
be
portraits
of
his
ancestors
earls
of
rossmore
well
they
are
not
they
are
chromos
of
distinguished
americans
all
moderns
but
he
has
carried
them
back
a
thousand
years
by
them
andrew
jackson
there
is
doing
what
he
can
to
be
the
late
american
earl
and
the
newest
treasure
in
the
collection
is
supposed
to
be
the
young
english
heir
i
mean
the
idiot
with
the
crape
but
in
truth
it
a
shoemaker
and
not
lord
berkeley
at
are
you
sure
why
of
course
i
am
he
would
look
like
why
because
his
conduct
in
his
last
moments
when
the
fire
was
sweeping
around
him
shows
that
he
was
a
man
it
shows
that
he
was
a
fine
young
tracy
was
strongly
moved
by
these
compliments
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
lovely
lips
took
on
a
new
loveliness
when
they
were
delivering
them
he
said
softly
it
is
a
pity
he
could
not
know
what
a
gracious
impression
his
behavior
was
going
to
leave
with
the
dearest
and
sweetest
stranger
in
the
land
of
oh
i
almost
loved
him
why
i
think
of
him
every
day
he
is
always
floating
about
in
my
tracy
felt
that
this
was
a
little
more
than
was
necessary
he
was
conscious
of
the
sting
of
jealousy
he
said
it
is
quite
right
to
think
of
him
at
least
now
and
then
that
is
at
intervals
in
perhaps
an
admiring
way
but
it
seems
to
me
that
howard
tracy
are
you
jealous
of
that
dead
man
he
was
ashamed
and
at
the
same
time
not
ashamed
he
was
jealous
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
jealous
in
a
sense
the
dead
man
was
himself
in
that
case
compliments
and
affection
lavished
upon
that
corpse
went
into
his
own
till
and
were
clear
profit
but
in
another
sense
the
dead
man
was
not
himself
and
in
that
case
all
compliments
and
affection
lavished
there
were
wasted
and
a
sufficient
basis
for
jealousy
a
tiff
was
the
result
of
the
dispute
between
the
two
then
they
made
it
up
and
were
more
loving
than
ever
as
an
affectionate
clincher
of
the
reconciliation
sally
declared
that
she
had
now
banished
lord
berkeley
from
her
mind
and
added
and
in
order
to
make
sure
that
he
shall
never
make
trouble
between
us
again
i
will
teach
myself
to
detest
that
name
and
all
that
have
ever
borne
it
or
ever
shall
bear
this
inflicted
another
pang
and
tracy
was
minded
to
ask
her
to
modify
that
a
little
just
on
general
principles
and
as
practice
in
not
overdoing
a
good
thing
perhaps
he
might
better
leave
things
as
they
were
and
not
risk
bringing
on
another
tiff
he
got
away
from
that
particular
and
sought
less
tender
ground
for
conversation
i
suppose
you
disapprove
wholly
of
aristocracies
and
nobilities
now
that
you
have
renounced
your
title
and
your
father
real
ones
oh
dear
no
but
i
thrown
aside
our
sham
one
for
this
answer
fell
just
at
the
right
time
and
just
in
the
right
place
to
save
the
poor
unstable
young
man
from
changing
his
political
complexion
once
more
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
totter
again
but
this
prop
shored
him
up
and
kept
him
from
floundering
back
into
democracy
and
aristocracy
so
he
went
home
glad
that
he
had
asked
the
fortunate
question
the
girl
would
accept
a
little
thing
like
a
genuine
earldom
she
was
merely
prejudiced
against
the
brummagem
article
yes
he
could
have
his
girl
and
have
his
earldom
too
that
question
was
a
fortunate
stroke
sally
went
to
bed
happy
too
and
remained
happy
deliriously
happy
for
nearly
two
hours
but
at
last
just
as
she
was
sinking
into
a
contented
and
luxurious
unconsciousness
the
shady
devil
who
lives
and
lurks
and
hides
and
watches
inside
of
human
beings
and
is
always
waiting
for
a
chance
to
do
the
proprietor
a
malicious
damage
whispered
to
her
soul
and
said
that
question
had
a
harmless
look
but
what
was
back
of
it
what
was
the
secret
motive
of
it
what
suggested
it
the
shady
devil
had
knifed
her
and
could
retire
now
and
take
a
rest
the
wound
would
attend
to
business
for
him
and
it
did
why
should
howard
tracy
ask
that
question
if
he
was
not
trying
to
marry
her
for
the
sake
of
her
rank
what
should
suggest
that
question
to
him
did
he
plainly
look
gratified
when
she
said
her
objections
to
aristocracy
had
their
limitations
ah
he
is
after
that
earldom
that
gilded
sham
it
is
poor
me
he
wants
so
she
argued
in
anguish
and
tears
then
she
argued
the
opposite
theory
but
made
a
weak
poor
business
of
it
and
lost
the
case
she
kept
the
arguing
up
one
side
and
then
the
other
the
rest
of
the
night
and
at
last
fell
asleep
at
dawn
fell
in
the
fire
at
dawn
one
may
say
for
that
kind
of
sleep
resembles
fire
and
one
comes
out
of
it
with
his
brain
baked
and
his
physical
forces
fried
out
of
him
chapter
xxiii
tracy
wrote
his
father
before
he
sought
his
bed
he
wrote
a
letter
which
he
believed
would
get
better
treatment
than
his
cablegram
received
for
it
contained
what
ought
to
be
welcome
news
namely
that
he
had
tried
equality
and
working
for
a
living
had
made
a
fight
which
he
could
find
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
and
in
the
matter
of
earning
a
living
had
proved
that
he
was
able
to
do
it
but
that
on
the
whole
he
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
he
could
not
reform
the
world
and
was
willing
to
retire
from
the
conflict
with
the
fair
degree
of
honor
which
he
had
gained
and
was
also
willing
to
return
home
and
resume
his
position
and
be
content
with
it
and
thankful
for
it
for
the
future
leaving
further
experiment
of
a
missionary
sort
to
other
young
people
needing
the
chastening
and
quelling
persuasions
of
experience
the
only
logic
sure
to
convince
a
diseased
imagination
and
restore
it
to
rugged
health
then
he
approached
the
subject
of
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
american
claimant
with
a
good
deal
of
caution
and
much
painstaking
art
he
said
praiseful
and
appreciative
things
about
the
girl
but
did
dwell
upon
that
detail
or
make
it
prominent
the
thing
which
he
made
prominent
was
the
opportunity
now
so
happily
afforded
to
reconcile
york
and
lancaster
graft
the
warring
roses
upon
one
stem
and
end
forever
a
crying
injustice
which
had
already
lasted
far
too
long
one
could
infer
that
he
had
thought
this
thing
all
out
and
chosen
this
way
of
making
all
things
fair
and
right
because
it
was
sufficiently
fair
and
considerably
wiser
than
the
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
england
one
could
infer
that
but
he
did
say
it
in
fact
the
more
he
read
his
letter
over
the
more
he
got
to
inferring
it
himself
when
the
old
earl
received
that
letter
the
first
part
of
it
filled
him
with
a
grim
and
snarly
satisfaction
but
the
rest
of
it
brought
a
snort
or
two
out
of
him
that
could
be
translated
differently
he
wasted
no
ink
in
this
emergency
either
in
cablegrams
or
letters
he
promptly
took
ship
for
america
to
look
into
the
matter
himself
he
had
staunchly
held
his
grip
all
this
long
time
and
given
no
sign
of
the
hunger
at
his
heart
to
see
his
son
hoping
for
the
cure
of
his
insane
dream
and
resolute
that
the
process
should
go
through
all
the
necessary
stages
without
assuaging
telegrams
or
other
nonsense
from
home
and
here
was
victory
at
last
victory
but
stupidly
marred
by
this
idiotic
marriage
project
yes
he
would
step
over
and
take
a
hand
in
this
matter
himself
during
the
first
ten
days
following
the
mailing
of
the
letter
spirits
had
no
idle
time
they
were
always
climbing
up
into
the
clouds
or
sliding
down
into
the
earth
as
deep
as
the
law
of
gravitation
reached
he
was
intensely
happy
or
intensely
miserable
by
turns
according
to
miss
sally
moods
he
never
could
tell
when
the
mood
was
going
to
change
and
when
it
changed
he
could
tell
what
it
was
that
had
changed
it
sometimes
she
was
so
in
love
with
him
that
her
love
was
tropical
torrid
and
she
could
find
no
language
fervent
enough
for
its
expression
then
suddenly
and
without
warning
or
any
apparent
reason
the
weather
would
change
and
the
victim
would
find
himself
adrift
among
the
icebergs
and
feeling
as
lonesome
and
friendless
as
the
north
pole
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
that
a
man
might
better
be
dead
than
exposed
to
these
devastating
varieties
of
climate
the
case
was
simple
sally
wanted
to
believe
that
tracy
preference
was
disinterested
so
she
was
always
applying
little
tests
of
one
sort
or
another
hoping
and
expecting
that
they
would
bring
out
evidence
which
would
confirm
or
fortify
her
belief
poor
tracy
did
not
know
that
these
experiments
were
being
made
upon
him
consequently
he
walked
promptly
into
all
the
traps
the
girl
set
for
him
these
traps
consisted
in
apparently
casual
references
to
social
distinction
aristocratic
title
and
privilege
and
such
things
often
tracy
responded
to
these
references
heedlessly
and
not
much
caring
what
he
said
provided
it
kept
the
talk
going
and
prolonged
the
seance
he
did
suspect
that
the
girl
was
watching
his
face
and
listening
for
his
words
as
one
who
watches
the
judge
face
and
listens
for
the
words
which
will
restore
him
to
home
and
friends
and
freedom
or
shut
him
away
from
the
sun
and
human
companionship
forever
he
did
suspect
that
his
careless
words
were
being
weighed
and
so
he
often
delivered
sentence
of
death
when
it
would
have
been
just
as
handy
and
all
the
same
to
him
to
pronounce
acquittal
daily
he
broke
the
girl
heart
nightly
he
sent
her
to
the
rack
for
sleep
he
could
understand
it
some
people
would
have
put
this
and
that
together
and
perceived
that
the
weather
never
changed
until
one
particular
subject
was
introduced
and
that
then
it
always
changed
and
they
would
have
looked
further
and
perceived
that
that
subject
was
always
introduced
by
the
one
party
never
the
other
they
would
have
argued
then
that
this
was
done
for
a
purpose
if
they
could
not
find
out
what
that
purpose
was
in
any
simpler
or
easier
way
they
would
ask
but
tracy
was
not
deep
enough
or
suspicious
enough
to
think
of
these
things
he
noticed
only
one
particular
that
the
weather
was
always
sunny
when
a
visit
began
no
matter
how
much
it
might
cloud
up
later
it
always
began
with
a
clear
sky
he
could
explain
this
curious
fact
to
himself
he
merely
knew
it
to
be
a
fact
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
by
the
time
tracy
had
been
out
of
sally
sight
six
hours
she
was
so
famishing
for
a
sight
of
him
that
her
doubts
and
suspicions
were
all
consumed
away
in
the
fire
of
that
longing
and
so
always
she
came
into
his
presence
as
surprisingly
radiant
and
joyous
as
she
was
when
she
went
out
of
it
in
circumstances
like
these
a
growing
portrait
runs
a
good
many
risks
the
portrait
of
sellers
by
tracy
was
fighting
along
day
by
day
through
this
mixed
weather
and
daily
adding
to
itself
ineradicable
signs
of
the
checkered
life
it
was
leading
it
was
the
happiest
portrait
in
spots
that
was
ever
seen
but
in
other
spots
a
damned
soul
looked
out
from
it
a
soul
that
was
suffering
all
the
different
kinds
of
distress
there
are
from
stomach
ache
to
rabies
but
sellers
liked
it
he
said
it
was
just
himself
all
over
a
portrait
that
sweated
moods
from
every
pore
and
no
two
moods
alike
he
said
he
had
as
many
different
kinds
of
emotions
in
him
as
a
jug
it
was
a
kind
of
a
deadly
work
of
art
maybe
but
it
was
a
starchy
picture
for
show
for
it
was
life
size
full
length
and
represented
the
american
earl
in
a
peer
scarlet
robe
with
the
three
ermine
bars
indicative
of
an
earl
rank
and
on
the
gray
head
an
earl
coronet
tilted
just
a
wee
bit
to
one
side
in
a
most
gallus
and
winsome
way
when
sally
weather
was
sunny
the
portrait
made
tracy
chuckle
but
when
her
weather
was
overcast
it
disordered
his
mind
and
stopped
the
circulation
of
his
blood
late
one
night
when
the
sweethearts
had
been
having
a
flawless
visit
together
sally
interior
devil
began
to
work
his
specialty
and
soon
the
conversation
was
drifting
toward
the
customary
rock
presently
in
the
midst
of
tracy
serene
flow
of
talk
he
felt
a
shudder
which
he
knew
was
not
his
shudder
but
exterior
to
his
breast
although
immediately
against
it
after
the
shudder
came
sobs
sally
was
crying
oh
my
darling
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
said
it
has
happened
again
what
have
i
done
to
wound
you
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
and
gave
him
a
look
of
deep
reproach
what
have
you
done
i
will
tell
you
what
you
have
done
you
have
unwittingly
revealed
oh
for
the
twentieth
time
though
i
could
not
believe
it
would
not
believe
it
that
it
is
not
me
you
love
but
that
foolish
sham
my
father
imitation
earldom
and
you
have
broken
my
heart
oh
my
child
what
are
you
saying
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
oh
howard
howard
the
things
you
have
uttered
when
you
were
forgetting
to
guard
your
tongue
have
betrayed
things
i
have
uttered
when
i
was
forgetting
to
guard
my
tongue
these
are
hard
words
when
have
i
remembered
to
guard
it
never
in
one
instance
it
has
no
office
but
to
speak
the
truth
it
needs
no
guarding
for
howard
i
have
noted
your
words
and
weighed
them
when
you
were
not
thinking
of
their
significance
and
they
have
told
me
more
than
you
meant
they
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
answered
the
trust
i
had
in
you
by
using
it
as
an
ambuscade
from
which
you
could
set
snares
for
my
unsuspecting
tongue
and
be
safe
from
detection
while
you
did
it
you
have
not
done
this
surely
you
have
not
done
this
thing
oh
one
enemy
could
not
do
this
was
an
aspect
of
the
girl
conduct
which
she
had
not
clearly
perceived
before
was
it
treachery
had
she
abused
a
trust
the
thought
crimsoned
her
cheeks
with
shame
and
remorse
oh
forgive
me
she
said
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
i
have
been
so
tortured
you
will
forgive
me
you
must
i
have
suffered
so
much
and
i
am
so
sorry
and
so
humble
you
do
forgive
me
you
do
turn
away
do
refuse
me
it
is
only
my
love
that
is
at
fault
and
you
know
i
love
you
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
bear
to
oh
dear
dear
i
am
so
miserable
and
i
never
meant
any
harm
and
i
did
see
where
this
insanity
was
carrying
me
and
how
it
was
wronging
and
abusing
the
dearest
heart
in
all
the
world
to
me
and
and
oh
take
me
in
your
arms
again
i
have
no
other
refuge
no
other
home
and
hope
there
was
reconciliation
again
immediate
perfect
and
with
it
utter
happiness
this
would
have
been
a
good
time
to
adjourn
but
no
now
that
the
was
revealed
at
last
now
that
it
was
manifest
that
all
the
sour
weather
had
come
from
this
girl
dread
that
tracy
was
lured
by
her
rank
and
not
herself
he
resolved
to
lay
that
ghost
immediately
and
permanently
by
furnishing
the
best
possible
proof
that
he
could
have
had
back
of
him
at
any
time
the
suspected
motive
so
he
said
let
me
whisper
a
little
secret
in
your
ear
a
secret
which
i
have
kept
shut
up
in
my
breast
all
this
time
your
rank
could
ever
have
been
an
enticement
i
am
son
and
heir
to
an
english
earl
the
girl
stared
at
him
one
two
three
moments
maybe
a
dozen
then
her
lips
parted
you
she
said
and
moved
away
from
him
still
gazing
at
him
in
a
kind
of
blank
amazement
why
why
certainly
i
am
why
do
you
act
like
this
what
have
i
done
now
what
have
you
done
you
have
certainly
made
a
most
strange
statement
you
must
see
that
well
with
a
timid
little
laugh
it
may
be
a
strange
enough
statement
but
of
what
consequence
is
that
if
it
is
true
if
it
is
true
you
are
already
retiring
from
oh
not
for
a
moment
you
should
not
say
that
i
have
not
deserved
it
i
have
spoken
the
truth
why
do
you
doubt
it
her
reply
was
prompt
simply
because
you
did
speak
it
earlier
oh
it
was
a
groan
exactly
but
it
was
an
intelligible
enough
expression
of
the
fact
that
he
saw
the
point
and
recognized
that
there
was
reason
in
it
you
have
seemed
to
conceal
nothing
from
me
that
i
ought
to
know
concerning
yourself
and
you
were
not
privileged
to
keep
back
such
a
thing
as
this
from
me
a
moment
after
after
well
after
you
had
determined
to
pay
your
court
to
its
true
it
true
i
know
it
but
there
were
circumstances
in
in
the
way
circumstances
which
she
waved
the
circumstances
aside
well
you
see
he
said
pleadingly
you
seemed
so
bent
on
our
traveling
the
proud
path
of
honest
labor
and
honorable
poverty
that
i
was
terrified
that
is
i
was
afraid
of
of
well
you
know
how
you
yes
i
know
how
i
talked
and
i
also
know
that
before
the
talk
was
finished
you
inquired
how
i
stood
as
regards
aristocracies
and
my
answer
was
calculated
to
relieve
your
he
was
silent
a
while
then
he
said
in
a
discouraged
way
i
do
see
any
way
out
of
it
it
was
a
mistake
that
is
in
truth
all
it
was
just
a
mistake
no
harm
was
meant
no
harm
in
the
world
i
did
see
how
it
might
some
time
look
it
is
my
way
i
do
seem
to
see
the
girl
was
almost
disarmed
for
a
moment
then
she
flared
up
again
an
earl
son
do
earls
sons
go
about
working
in
lowly
callings
for
their
bread
and
butter
god
knows
they
do
i
have
wished
they
do
earls
sons
sink
their
degree
in
a
country
like
this
and
come
sober
and
decent
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
a
born
child
of
poverty
when
they
can
go
drunk
profane
and
steeped
in
dishonorable
debt
and
buy
the
pick
and
choice
of
the
millionaires
daughters
of
america
you
an
earl
son
show
me
the
i
thank
god
i
am
not
able
if
those
are
the
signs
but
yet
i
am
an
earl
son
and
heir
it
is
all
i
can
say
i
wish
you
would
believe
me
but
you
will
not
i
know
no
way
to
persuade
she
was
about
to
soften
again
but
his
closing
remark
made
her
bring
her
foot
down
with
smart
vexation
and
she
cried
out
oh
you
drive
all
patience
out
of
me
would
you
have
one
believe
that
you
have
your
proofs
at
hand
and
yet
are
what
you
say
you
are
you
do
not
put
your
hand
in
your
pocket
now
for
you
have
nothing
there
you
make
a
claim
like
this
and
then
venture
to
travel
without
credentials
these
are
simply
incredibilities
do
you
see
that
yourself
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
a
defence
of
some
kind
or
other
hesitated
a
little
and
then
said
with
difficulty
and
diffidence
i
will
tell
you
just
the
truth
foolish
as
it
will
seem
to
you
to
anybody
i
suppose
but
it
is
the
truth
i
had
an
ideal
call
it
a
dream
a
folly
if
you
will
but
i
wanted
to
renounce
the
privileges
and
unfair
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
nobility
and
wrung
from
the
nation
by
force
and
fraud
and
purge
myself
of
my
share
of
those
crimes
against
right
and
reason
by
thenceforth
comrading
with
the
poor
and
humble
on
equal
terms
earning
with
my
own
hands
the
bread
i
ate
and
rising
by
my
own
merit
if
i
rose
at
the
young
girl
scanned
his
face
narrowly
while
he
spoke
and
there
was
something
about
his
simplicity
of
manner
and
statement
which
touched
her
touched
her
almost
to
the
danger
point
but
she
set
her
grip
on
the
yielding
spirit
and
choked
it
to
quiescence
it
could
not
be
wise
to
surrender
to
compassion
or
any
kind
of
sentiment
yet
she
must
ask
one
or
two
more
questions
tracy
was
reading
her
face
and
what
he
read
there
lifted
his
drooping
hopes
a
little
an
earl
son
to
do
that
why
he
were
a
man
a
man
to
love
oh
more
a
man
to
worship
why
i
but
he
never
lived
he
is
not
born
he
will
not
be
born
the
that
could
do
that
even
in
utter
folly
and
hopeless
of
conveying
benefit
to
any
beyond
the
mere
example
could
be
mistaken
for
greatness
why
it
would
be
greatness
in
this
cold
age
of
sordid
ideals
a
moment
wait
let
me
finish
i
have
one
question
more
your
father
is
earl
of
what
rossmore
and
i
am
viscount
berkeley
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
again
the
girl
felt
so
outraged
that
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
speak
how
can
you
venture
such
a
brazen
thing
you
know
that
he
is
dead
and
you
know
that
i
know
it
oh
to
rob
the
living
of
name
and
honors
for
a
selfish
and
temporary
advantage
is
crime
enough
but
to
rob
the
defenceless
dead
why
it
is
more
than
crime
it
degrades
crime
oh
listen
to
me
just
a
word
do
turn
away
like
that
go
do
leave
me
so
stay
one
moment
on
my
honor
oh
on
your
honor
on
my
honor
i
am
what
i
say
and
i
will
prove
it
and
you
will
believe
i
know
you
will
i
will
bring
you
a
message
a
cablegram
when
next
day
signed
yes
signed
what
will
that
prove
what
will
it
prove
what
should
it
prove
if
you
force
me
to
say
it
possibly
the
presence
of
a
confederate
this
was
a
hard
blow
and
staggered
him
he
said
dejectedly
it
is
true
i
did
not
think
of
it
oh
my
god
i
do
not
know
any
way
to
do
i
do
everything
wrong
you
are
going
and
you
wo
say
even
or
ah
we
have
not
parted
like
this
oh
i
want
to
run
and
no
go
a
pause
then
she
said
you
may
bring
the
message
when
it
oh
may
i
god
bless
he
was
gone
and
none
too
soon
her
lips
were
already
quivering
and
now
she
broke
down
through
her
sobbings
her
words
broke
from
time
to
time
oh
he
is
gone
i
have
lost
him
i
shall
never
see
him
any
more
and
he
did
kiss
me
never
even
offered
to
force
a
kiss
from
me
and
he
knowing
it
was
the
very
very
last
and
i
expecting
he
would
and
never
dreaming
he
would
treat
me
so
after
all
we
have
been
to
each
other
oh
oh
oh
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
he
is
a
dear
poor
miserable
transparent
liar
and
humbug
but
oh
i
do
love
him
so
after
a
little
she
broke
into
speech
again
how
dear
he
is
and
i
shall
miss
him
so
i
shall
miss
him
so
why
wo
he
ever
think
to
forge
a
message
and
fetch
it
but
no
he
never
will
he
never
thinks
of
anything
he
so
honest
and
simple
it
would
ever
occur
to
him
oh
what
did
possess
him
to
think
he
could
succeed
as
a
fraud
and
he
has
the
first
requisite
except
duplicity
that
i
can
see
oh
dear
i
go
to
bed
and
give
it
all
up
oh
i
wish
i
had
told
him
to
come
and
tell
me
whenever
he
did
get
any
telegram
and
now
it
all
my
own
fault
if
i
never
see
him
again
how
my
eyes
must
look
chapter
xxiv
next
day
sure
enough
the
cablegram
did
come
this
was
an
immense
disaster
for
tracy
could
go
into
the
presence
without
that
ticket
although
it
was
going
to
possess
any
value
as
evidence
but
if
the
failure
of
the
cablegram
on
that
first
day
may
be
called
an
immense
disaster
where
is
the
dictionary
that
can
turn
out
a
phrase
sizeable
enough
to
describe
the
tenth
day
failure
of
course
every
day
that
the
cablegram
did
come
made
tracy
all
of
hours
more
ashamed
of
himself
than
he
was
the
day
before
and
made
sally
fully
hours
more
certain
than
ever
that
he
not
only
had
any
father
anywhere
but
had
even
a
confederate
and
so
it
followed
that
he
was
a
humbug
and
could
be
otherwise
these
were
hard
days
for
barrow
and
the
art
firm
all
these
had
their
hands
full
trying
to
comfort
tracy
barrow
task
was
particularly
hard
because
he
was
made
a
confidant
in
full
and
therefore
had
to
humor
tracy
delusion
that
he
had
a
father
and
that
the
father
was
an
earl
and
that
he
was
going
to
send
a
cablegram
barrow
early
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
convince
tracy
that
he
had
any
father
because
this
had
such
a
bad
effect
on
the
patient
and
worked
up
his
temper
to
such
an
alarming
degree
he
had
tried
as
an
experiment
letting
tracy
think
he
had
a
father
the
result
was
so
good
that
he
went
further
with
proper
caution
and
tried
letting
him
think
his
father
was
an
earl
this
wrought
so
well
that
he
grew
bold
and
tried
letting
him
think
he
had
two
fathers
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
did
want
to
so
barrow
withdrew
one
of
them
and
substituted
letting
him
think
he
was
going
to
get
a
cablegram
which
barrow
judged
he
would
and
was
right
but
barrow
worked
the
cablegram
daily
for
all
it
was
worth
and
it
was
the
one
thing
that
kept
tracy
alive
that
was
barrow
opinion
and
these
were
bitter
hard
days
for
poor
sally
and
mainly
delivered
up
to
private
crying
she
kept
her
furniture
pretty
damp
and
so
caught
cold
and
the
dampness
and
the
cold
and
the
sorrow
together
undermined
her
appetite
and
she
was
a
pitiful
enough
object
poor
thing
her
state
was
bad
enough
as
per
statement
of
it
above
quoted
but
all
the
forces
of
nature
and
circumstance
seemed
conspiring
to
make
it
worse
and
succeeding
for
instance
the
morning
after
her
dismissal
of
tracy
hawkins
and
sellers
read
in
the
associated
press
dispatches
that
a
toy
puzzle
called
pigs
in
the
clover
had
come
into
sudden
favor
within
the
past
few
weeks
and
that
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
all
the
populations
of
all
the
states
had
knocked
off
work
to
play
with
it
and
that
the
business
of
the
country
had
now
come
to
a
standstill
by
consequence
that
judges
lawyers
burglars
parsons
thieves
merchants
mechanics
murderers
women
children
babies
everybody
indeed
could
be
seen
from
morning
till
midnight
absorbed
in
one
deep
project
and
purpose
and
only
one
to
pen
those
pigs
work
out
that
puzzle
successfully
that
all
gayety
all
cheerfulness
had
departed
from
the
nation
and
in
its
place
care
preoccupation
and
anxiety
sat
upon
every
countenance
and
all
faces
were
drawn
distressed
and
furrowed
with
the
signs
of
age
and
trouble
and
marked
with
the
still
sadder
signs
of
mental
decay
and
incipient
madness
that
factories
were
at
work
night
and
day
in
eight
cities
and
yet
to
supply
the
demand
for
the
puzzle
was
thus
far
impossible
hawkins
was
wild
with
joy
but
sellers
was
calm
small
matters
could
not
disturb
his
serenity
he
said
that
just
the
way
things
go
a
man
invents
a
thing
which
could
revolutionize
the
arts
produce
mountains
of
money
and
bless
the
earth
and
who
will
bother
with
it
or
show
any
interest
in
it
and
so
you
are
just
as
poor
as
you
were
before
but
you
invent
some
worthless
thing
to
amuse
yourself
with
and
would
throw
it
away
if
let
alone
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
world
makes
a
snatch
for
it
and
out
crops
a
fortune
hunt
up
that
yankee
and
collect
hawkins
half
is
yours
you
know
leave
me
to
potter
at
my
this
was
a
temperance
lecture
sellers
was
head
chief
in
the
temperance
camp
and
had
lectured
now
and
then
in
that
interest
but
had
been
dissatisfied
with
his
efforts
wherefore
he
was
now
about
to
try
a
new
plan
after
much
thought
he
had
concluded
that
a
main
reason
why
his
lectures
lacked
fire
or
something
was
that
they
were
too
transparently
amateurish
that
is
to
say
it
was
probably
too
plainly
perceptible
that
the
lecturer
was
trying
to
tell
people
about
the
horrid
effects
of
liquor
when
he
did
really
know
anything
about
those
effects
except
from
hearsay
since
he
had
hardly
ever
tasted
an
intoxicant
in
his
life
his
scheme
now
was
to
prepare
himself
to
speak
from
bitter
experience
hawkins
was
to
stand
by
with
the
bottle
calculate
the
doses
watch
the
effects
make
notes
of
results
and
otherwise
assist
in
the
preparation
time
was
short
for
the
ladies
would
be
along
about
noon
that
is
to
say
the
temperance
organization
called
the
daughters
of
siloam
and
sellers
must
be
ready
to
head
the
procession
the
time
kept
slipping
along
hawkins
did
not
return
sellers
could
not
venture
to
wait
longer
so
he
attacked
the
bottle
himself
and
proceeded
to
note
the
effects
hawkins
got
back
at
last
took
one
comprehensive
glance
at
the
lecturer
and
went
down
and
headed
off
the
procession
the
ladies
were
grieved
to
hear
that
the
champion
had
been
taken
suddenly
ill
and
violently
so
but
glad
to
hear
that
it
was
hoped
he
would
be
out
again
in
a
few
days
as
it
turned
out
the
old
gentleman
did
turn
over
or
show
any
signs
of
life
worth
speaking
of
for
hours
then
he
asked
after
the
procession
and
learned
what
had
happened
about
it
he
was
sorry
said
he
had
been
fixed
for
it
he
remained
abed
several
days
and
his
wife
and
daughter
took
turns
in
sitting
with
him
and
ministering
to
his
wants
often
he
patted
sally
head
and
tried
to
comfort
her
do
cry
my
child
do
cry
so
you
know
your
old
father
did
it
by
mistake
and
did
mean
a
bit
of
harm
you
know
he
intentionally
do
anything
to
make
you
ashamed
for
the
world
you
know
he
was
trying
to
do
good
and
only
made
the
mistake
through
ignorance
not
knowing
the
right
doses
and
washington
not
there
to
help
do
cry
so
dear
it
breaks
my
old
heart
to
see
you
and
think
i
brought
this
humiliation
on
you
and
you
so
dear
to
me
and
so
good
i
wo
ever
do
it
again
indeed
i
wo
now
be
comforted
honey
that
a
good
but
when
she
was
on
duty
at
the
bedside
the
crying
went
on
just
the
same
then
the
mother
would
try
to
comfort
her
and
say
do
cry
dear
he
never
meant
any
harm
it
was
all
one
of
those
happens
that
you
ca
guard
against
when
you
are
trying
experiments
that
way
you
see
i
do
cry
it
because
i
know
him
so
well
i
could
never
look
anybody
in
the
face
again
if
he
had
got
into
such
an
amazing
condition
as
that
but
bless
you
his
intention
was
pure
and
high
and
that
makes
the
act
pure
though
it
was
higher
than
was
necessary
we
not
humiliated
dear
he
did
it
under
a
noble
impulse
and
we
do
need
to
be
ashamed
there
do
cry
any
more
thus
the
old
gentleman
was
useful
to
sally
during
several
days
as
an
explanation
of
her
tearfulness
she
felt
thankful
to
him
for
the
shelter
he
was
affording
her
but
often
said
to
herself
it
a
shame
to
let
him
see
in
my
crying
a
reproach
as
if
he
could
ever
do
anything
that
could
make
me
reproach
him
but
i
ca
confess
i
got
to
go
on
using
him
for
a
pretext
he
the
only
one
i
got
in
the
world
and
i
do
need
one
so
as
soon
as
sellers
was
out
again
and
found
that
stacks
of
money
had
been
placed
in
bank
for
him
and
hawkins
by
the
yankee
he
said
now
we
soon
see
who
the
claimant
and
who
the
authentic
i
just
go
over
there
and
warm
up
that
house
of
during
the
next
few
days
he
and
his
wife
were
so
busy
with
preparations
for
the
voyage
that
sally
had
all
the
privacy
she
needed
and
all
the
chance
to
cry
that
was
good
for
her
then
the
old
pair
left
for
new
york
and
england
sally
had
also
had
a
chance
to
do
another
thing
that
was
to
make
up
her
mind
that
life
was
not
worth
living
upon
the
present
terms
if
she
must
give
up
her
impostor
and
die
doubtless
she
must
submit
but
might
she
not
lay
her
whole
case
before
some
disinterested
person
first
and
see
if
there
was
perhaps
some
saving
way
out
of
the
matter
she
turned
this
idea
over
in
her
mind
a
good
deal
in
her
first
visit
with
hawkins
after
her
parents
were
gone
the
talk
fell
upon
tracy
and
she
was
impelled
to
set
her
case
before
the
statesman
and
take
his
counsel
so
she
poured
out
her
heart
and
he
listened
with
painful
solicitude
she
concluded
pleadingly
with
do
tell
me
he
is
an
impostor
i
suppose
he
is
but
does
it
look
to
you
as
if
he
is
you
are
cool
you
know
and
outside
and
so
maybe
it
can
look
to
you
as
if
he
is
one
when
it
ca
to
me
does
it
look
to
you
as
if
he
is
could
you
ca
it
look
to
you
that
way
for
for
my
sake
the
poor
man
was
troubled
but
he
felt
obliged
to
keep
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
truth
he
fought
around
the
present
detail
a
little
while
then
gave
it
up
and
said
he
could
really
see
his
way
to
clearing
tracy
no
he
said
the
truth
is
he
an
that
is
you
you
feel
a
little
certain
but
not
entirely
oh
not
entirely
hawkins
it
a
pity
to
have
to
say
it
i
do
hate
to
say
it
but
i
do
think
anything
about
it
i
know
he
an
oh
now
hawkins
you
ca
go
that
far
a
body
ca
really
know
it
you
know
it
is
proved
that
he
not
what
he
says
he
should
he
come
out
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
wretched
business
yes
at
least
the
most
of
it
it
ought
to
be
done
so
he
set
his
teeth
and
went
at
the
matter
with
determination
but
purposing
to
spare
the
girl
one
pain
that
of
knowing
that
tracy
was
a
criminal
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
plain
tale
one
not
pleasant
for
me
to
tell
or
for
you
to
hear
but
we
got
to
stand
it
i
know
all
about
that
fellow
and
i
know
he
is
no
earl
the
girl
eyes
flashed
and
she
said
i
do
care
a
snap
for
that
go
on
this
was
so
wholly
unexpected
that
it
at
once
obstructed
the
narrative
hawkins
was
not
even
sure
that
he
had
heard
aright
he
said
i
do
know
that
i
quite
understand
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
he
was
all
right
and
proper
otherwise
you
be
indifferent
about
the
earl
part
of
the
business
you
be
entirely
satisfied
with
him
and
would
care
for
his
not
being
an
earl
son
that
being
an
earl
son
would
add
any
value
to
him
not
the
least
value
that
i
would
care
for
why
hawkins
gotten
over
all
that
about
earldoms
and
aristocracies
and
all
such
nonsense
and
am
become
just
a
plain
ordinary
nobody
and
content
with
it
and
it
is
to
him
i
owe
my
cure
and
as
to
anything
being
able
to
add
a
value
to
him
nothing
can
do
that
he
is
the
whole
world
to
me
just
as
he
is
he
comprehends
all
the
values
there
are
then
how
can
you
add
one
she
pretty
far
he
said
that
to
himself
he
continued
still
to
himself
i
must
change
my
plan
again
i
ca
seem
to
strike
one
that
will
stand
the
requirements
of
this
most
variegated
emergency
five
minutes
on
a
stretch
without
making
this
fellow
a
criminal
i
believe
i
will
invent
a
name
and
a
character
for
him
calculated
to
disenchant
her
if
it
fails
to
do
it
then
i
know
that
the
next
rightest
thing
to
do
will
be
to
help
her
to
her
fate
poor
thing
not
hinder
then
he
said
aloud
well
gwendolen
i
want
to
be
called
i
glad
of
it
i
like
it
better
myself
well
then
i
tell
you
about
this
man
snodgrass
is
that
his
name
yes
snodgrass
the
other
his
nom
de
it
hideous
i
know
it
is
but
we
ca
help
our
and
that
is
truly
his
real
name
and
not
howard
tracy
hawkins
answered
regretfully
yes
it
seems
a
the
girl
sampled
the
name
musingly
once
or
twice
snodgrass
snodgrass
no
i
could
not
endure
that
i
could
not
get
used
to
it
no
i
should
call
him
by
his
first
name
what
is
his
first
name
his
er
his
initials
are
his
initials
i
do
care
anything
about
his
initials
i
ca
call
him
by
his
initials
what
do
they
stand
for
well
you
see
his
father
was
a
physician
and
he
he
well
he
was
an
idolater
of
his
profession
and
he
well
he
was
a
very
eccentric
man
and
what
do
they
stand
for
what
are
you
shuffling
about
they
well
they
stand
for
spinal
meningitis
his
father
being
a
phy
i
never
heard
such
an
infamous
name
nobody
can
ever
call
a
person
that
a
person
they
love
i
would
call
an
enemy
by
such
a
name
it
sounds
like
an
after
a
moment
she
added
with
a
kind
of
consternation
why
it
would
be
my
name
letters
would
come
with
it
yes
spinal
meningitis
do
repeat
it
do
i
ca
bear
it
was
the
father
a
lunatic
no
that
is
not
i
am
glad
of
that
because
that
is
transmissible
what
do
you
think
was
the
matter
with
him
then
well
i
do
really
know
the
family
used
to
run
a
good
deal
to
idiots
and
so
maybe
oh
there
is
any
maybe
about
it
this
one
was
an
well
yes
he
could
have
been
he
was
suspected
said
sally
with
irritation
would
one
suspect
there
was
going
to
be
a
dark
time
if
he
saw
the
constellations
fall
out
of
the
sky
but
that
is
enough
about
the
idiot
i
do
take
any
interest
in
idiots
tell
me
about
the
very
well
then
this
one
was
the
eldest
but
not
the
favorite
his
brother
zylobalsamum
wait
give
me
a
chance
to
realize
that
it
is
perfectly
stupefying
zylo
what
did
you
call
it
i
never
heard
such
a
name
it
sounds
like
a
disease
is
it
a
disease
no
i
do
think
it
a
disease
it
either
scriptural
or
well
it
not
then
it
anatomical
i
knew
it
was
one
or
the
other
yes
i
remember
now
it
is
anatomical
it
a
ganglion
a
nerve
centre
it
is
what
is
called
the
zylobalsamum
well
go
on
and
if
you
come
to
any
more
of
them
omit
the
names
they
make
one
feel
so
very
well
then
as
i
said
this
one
was
not
a
favorite
in
the
family
and
so
he
was
neglected
in
every
way
never
sent
to
school
always
allowed
to
associate
with
the
worst
and
coarsest
characters
and
so
of
course
he
has
grown
up
a
rude
vulgar
ignorant
dissipated
ruffian
and
he
it
no
such
thing
you
ought
to
be
more
generous
than
to
make
such
a
statement
as
that
about
a
poor
young
stranger
who
who
why
he
is
the
very
opposite
of
that
he
is
considerate
courteous
obliging
modest
gentle
refined
for
shame
how
can
you
say
such
things
about
him
i
do
blame
you
sally
indeed
i
have
a
word
of
blame
for
you
for
being
blinded
by
your
affection
blinded
to
these
minor
defects
which
are
so
manifest
to
others
who
minor
defects
do
you
call
these
minor
defects
what
are
murder
and
arson
pray
it
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
straight
off
and
of
course
estimates
of
such
things
vary
with
environment
with
us
out
our
way
they
would
not
necessarily
attract
as
much
attention
as
with
you
yet
they
are
often
regarded
with
disapproval
murder
and
arson
are
regarded
with
disapproval
oh
with
disapproval
who
are
those
puritans
you
are
talking
about
but
wait
how
did
you
come
to
know
so
much
about
this
family
where
did
you
get
all
this
hearsay
evidence
sally
it
is
hearsay
evidence
that
is
the
serious
part
of
it
i
knew
that
family
this
was
a
surprise
you
you
actually
knew
them
knew
zylo
as
we
used
to
call
him
and
knew
his
father
snodgrass
i
did
know
your
own
snodgrass
but
have
had
glimpses
of
him
from
time
to
time
and
i
heard
about
him
all
the
time
he
was
the
common
talk
you
see
on
account
of
his
on
account
of
his
not
being
a
or
an
assassin
i
suppose
that
would
have
made
him
commonplace
where
did
you
know
these
people
in
cherokee
oh
how
preposterous
there
are
not
enough
people
in
cherokee
strip
to
give
anybody
a
reputation
good
or
bad
there
is
a
quorum
why
the
whole
population
consists
of
a
couple
of
wagon
loads
of
horse
hawkins
answered
placidly
our
friend
was
one
of
those
wagon
sally
eyes
burned
and
her
breath
came
quick
and
fast
but
she
kept
a
fairly
good
grip
on
her
anger
and
did
not
let
it
get
the
advantage
of
her
tongue
the
statesman
sat
still
and
waited
for
developments
he
was
content
with
his
work
it
was
as
handsome
a
piece
of
diplomatic
art
as
he
had
ever
turned
out
he
thought
and
now
let
the
girl
make
her
own
choice
he
judged
she
would
let
her
spectre
go
he
had
a
doubt
of
it
in
fact
but
anyway
let
the
choice
be
made
and
he
was
ready
to
ratify
it
and
offer
no
further
hindrance
meantime
sally
had
thought
her
case
out
and
made
up
her
mind
to
the
major
disappointment
the
verdict
was
against
him
sally
said
he
has
no
friend
but
me
and
i
will
not
desert
him
now
i
will
not
marry
him
if
his
moral
character
is
bad
but
if
he
can
prove
that
it
is
i
will
and
he
shall
have
the
chance
to
me
he
seems
utterly
good
and
dear
i
never
seen
anything
about
him
that
looked
otherwise
except
of
course
his
calling
himself
an
earl
son
maybe
that
is
only
vanity
and
no
real
harm
when
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
do
not
believe
he
is
any
such
person
as
you
have
painted
him
i
want
to
see
him
i
want
you
to
find
him
and
send
him
to
me
i
will
implore
him
to
be
honest
with
me
and
tell
me
the
whole
truth
and
not
be
very
well
if
that
is
your
decision
i
will
do
it
but
sally
you
know
he
poor
and
oh
i
do
care
anything
about
that
that
neither
here
nor
there
will
you
bring
him
to
me
i
do
it
when
oh
dear
it
getting
toward
dark
now
and
so
you
have
to
put
it
off
till
morning
but
you
will
find
him
in
the
morning
wo
you
i
have
him
here
by
oh
now
you
your
own
old
self
again
and
lovelier
than
ever
i
could
ask
fairer
than
that
sally
mused
a
moment
alone
then
said
earnestly
i
love
him
in
spite
of
his
name
and
went
about
her
affairs
with
a
light
heart
chapter
xxv
hawkins
went
straight
to
the
telegraph
office
and
disburdened
his
conscience
he
said
to
himself
she
not
going
to
give
this
galvanized
cadaver
up
that
plain
wild
horses
ca
pull
her
away
from
him
done
my
share
it
for
sellers
to
take
an
innings
so
he
sent
this
message
to
new
york
come
back
hire
special
train
she
going
to
marry
the
meantime
a
note
came
to
rossmore
towers
to
say
that
the
earl
of
rossmore
had
just
arrived
from
england
and
would
do
himself
the
pleasure
of
calling
in
the
evening
sally
said
to
herself
it
is
a
pity
he
stop
in
new
york
but
it
no
matter
he
can
go
up
and
see
my
father
he
has
come
over
here
to
tomahawk
papa
very
likely
or
buy
out
his
claim
this
thing
would
have
excited
me
a
while
back
but
it
has
only
one
interest
for
me
now
and
only
one
value
i
can
say
to
to
spine
spiny
spinal
i
do
like
any
form
of
that
name
i
can
say
to
him
try
to
keep
it
up
any
more
or
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
whom
i
have
been
talking
with
last
night
and
then
you
will
be
embarrassed
tracy
could
know
he
was
to
be
invited
for
the
morrow
or
he
might
have
waited
as
it
was
he
was
too
miserable
to
wait
any
longer
for
his
last
hope
a
letter
had
failed
him
it
was
fully
due
it
had
not
come
had
his
father
really
flung
him
away
it
looked
so
it
was
not
like
his
father
but
it
surely
looked
so
his
father
was
a
rather
tough
nut
in
truth
but
had
never
been
so
with
his
son
still
this
implacable
silence
had
a
calamitous
look
anyway
tracy
would
go
to
the
towers
and
then
what
he
did
know
his
head
was
tired
out
with
thinking
he
would
think
about
what
he
must
do
or
say
let
it
all
take
care
of
itself
so
that
he
saw
sally
once
more
he
would
be
satisfied
happen
what
might
he
would
care
he
hardly
knew
how
he
got
to
the
towers
or
when
he
knew
and
cared
for
only
one
thing
he
was
alone
with
sally
she
was
kind
she
was
gentle
there
was
moisture
in
her
eyes
and
a
yearning
something
in
her
face
and
manner
which
she
could
not
wholly
hide
but
she
kept
her
distance
they
talked
bye
and
bye
she
said
watching
his
downcast
countenance
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
it
so
lonesome
with
papa
and
mamma
gone
i
try
to
read
but
i
seem
to
get
interested
in
any
book
i
try
the
newspapers
but
they
do
put
such
rubbish
in
them
you
take
up
a
paper
and
start
to
read
something
you
thinks
interesting
and
it
goes
on
and
on
and
on
about
how
somebody
well
snodgrass
for
instance
not
a
movement
from
tracy
not
the
quiver
of
a
muscle
sally
was
amazed
what
command
of
himself
he
must
have
being
disconcerted
she
paused
so
long
that
tracy
presently
looked
up
wearily
and
said
well
oh
i
thought
you
were
not
listening
yes
it
goes
on
and
on
about
this
doctor
snodgrass
till
you
are
so
tired
and
then
about
his
younger
son
the
favorite
son
zylobalsamum
snodgrass
not
a
sign
from
tracy
whose
head
was
drooping
again
what
supernatural
sally
fixed
her
eye
on
him
and
began
again
resolved
to
blast
him
out
of
his
serenity
this
time
if
she
knew
how
to
apply
the
dynamite
that
is
concealed
in
certain
forms
of
words
when
those
words
are
properly
loaded
with
unexpected
meanings
and
next
it
goes
on
and
on
and
on
about
the
eldest
son
not
the
favorite
this
one
and
how
he
is
neglected
in
his
poor
barren
boyhood
and
allowed
to
grow
up
unschooled
ignorant
coarse
vulgar
the
comrade
of
the
community
scum
and
become
in
his
completed
manhood
a
rude
profane
dissipated
ruffian
that
head
still
drooped
sally
rose
moved
softly
and
solemnly
a
step
or
two
and
stood
before
tracy
his
head
came
slowly
up
his
meek
eyes
met
her
intense
ones
then
she
finished
with
deep
impressiveness
named
spinal
meningitis
snodgrass
tracy
merely
exhibited
signs
of
increased
fatigue
the
girl
was
outraged
by
this
iron
indifference
and
callousness
and
cried
out
what
are
you
made
of
i
why
have
you
any
sensitiveness
do
these
things
touch
any
poor
remnant
of
delicate
feeling
in
you
n
no
he
said
wonderingly
they
do
seem
to
why
should
they
o
dear
me
how
can
you
look
so
innocent
and
foolish
and
good
and
empty
and
gentle
and
all
that
right
in
the
hearing
of
such
things
as
those
look
me
in
the
eye
straight
in
the
eye
there
now
then
answer
me
without
a
flinch
is
doctor
snodgrass
your
father
and
zylobalsamum
your
brother
here
hawkins
was
about
to
enter
the
room
but
changed
his
mind
upon
hearing
these
words
and
elected
for
a
walk
down
town
and
so
glided
swiftly
away
and
is
your
name
spinal
meningitis
and
is
your
father
a
doctor
and
an
idiot
like
all
the
family
for
generations
and
does
he
name
all
his
children
after
poisons
and
pestilences
and
abnormal
anatomical
eccentricities
of
the
human
body
answer
me
some
way
or
somehow
and
quick
why
do
you
sit
there
looking
like
an
envelope
without
any
address
on
it
and
see
me
going
mad
before
your
face
with
suspense
oh
i
wish
i
could
do
do
i
wish
i
could
do
something
anything
that
would
give
you
peace
again
and
make
you
happy
but
i
know
of
nothing
i
know
of
no
way
i
have
never
heard
of
these
awful
people
what
say
it
again
i
have
never
never
in
my
life
till
oh
you
do
look
so
honest
when
you
say
that
it
must
be
true
surely
you
could
look
that
way
you
would
look
that
way
if
it
were
not
true
would
you
i
could
and
would
it
is
true
oh
let
us
end
this
suffering
take
me
back
into
your
heart
and
confidence
wait
one
more
thing
tell
me
you
told
that
falsehood
out
of
mere
vanity
and
are
sorry
for
it
that
you
not
expecting
to
ever
wear
the
coronet
of
an
earl
truly
i
am
cured
cured
this
very
day
i
am
not
expecting
it
o
now
you
are
mine
i
got
you
back
in
the
beauty
and
glory
of
your
unsmirched
poverty
and
your
honorable
obscurity
and
nobody
shall
ever
take
you
from
me
again
but
the
grave
and
if
de
earl
of
rossmore
fum
englan
my
father
the
young
man
released
the
girl
and
hung
his
head
the
old
gentleman
stood
surveying
the
couple
the
one
with
a
strongly
complimentary
right
eye
the
other
with
a
mixed
expression
done
with
the
left
this
is
difficult
and
not
often
resorted
to
presently
his
face
relaxed
into
a
kind
of
constructive
gentleness
and
he
said
to
his
son
do
you
think
you
could
embrace
me
too
the
young
man
did
it
with
alacrity
then
you
are
the
son
of
an
earl
after
all
said
sally
reproachfully
yes
i
then
i
wo
have
you
o
but
you
know
no
i
will
not
you
told
me
another
she
right
go
away
and
leave
us
i
want
to
talk
with
berkeley
was
obliged
to
go
but
he
did
not
go
far
he
remained
on
the
premises
at
midnight
the
conference
between
the
old
gentleman
and
the
young
girl
was
still
going
blithely
on
but
it
presently
drew
to
a
close
and
the
former
said
i
came
all
the
way
over
here
to
inspect
you
my
dear
with
the
general
idea
of
breaking
off
this
match
if
there
were
two
fools
of
you
but
as
there
only
one
you
can
have
him
if
you
take
indeed
i
will
then
may
i
kiss
you
you
may
thank
you
now
you
shall
have
that
privilege
whenever
you
are
meantime
hawkins
had
long
ago
returned
and
slipped
up
into
the
laboratory
he
was
rather
disconcerted
to
find
his
late
invention
snodgrass
there
the
news
was
told
him
that
the
english
rossmore
was
come
and
i
his
son
viscount
berkeley
not
howard
tracy
any
hawkins
was
aghast
he
said
good
gracious
then
you
dead
dead
yes
you
are
we
got
your
hang
those
ashes
i
tired
of
them
i
give
them
to
my
slowly
and
painfully
the
statesman
worked
the
truth
into
his
head
that
this
was
really
a
flesh
and
blood
young
man
and
not
the
insubstantial
resurrection
he
and
sellers
had
so
long
supposed
him
to
be
then
he
said
with
feeling
i
so
glad
so
glad
on
sally
account
poor
thing
we
took
you
for
a
departed
materialized
bank
thief
from
tahlequah
this
will
be
a
heavy
blow
to
then
he
explained
the
whole
matter
to
berkeley
who
said
well
the
claimant
must
manage
to
stand
the
blow
severe
as
it
is
but
he
get
over
the
who
the
colonel
he
get
over
it
the
minute
he
invents
a
new
miracle
to
take
its
place
and
he
already
at
it
by
this
time
but
look
here
what
do
you
suppose
became
of
the
man
you
been
representing
all
this
time
i
do
know
i
saved
his
clothes
it
was
all
i
could
do
i
am
afraid
he
lost
his
well
you
must
have
found
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
those
clothes
in
money
or
certificates
of
no
i
found
only
five
hundred
and
a
trifle
i
borrowed
the
trifle
and
banked
the
five
what
we
do
about
it
return
it
to
the
it
easy
said
but
not
easy
to
manage
let
leave
it
alone
till
we
get
sellers
advice
and
that
reminds
me
i
got
to
run
and
meet
sellers
and
explain
who
you
are
not
and
who
you
are
or
he
come
thundering
in
here
to
stop
his
daughter
from
marrying
a
phantom
but
suppose
your
father
came
over
here
to
break
off
the
match
well
is
he
down
stairs
getting
acquainted
with
sally
that
all
so
hawkins
departed
to
meet
and
prepare
the

rossmore
towers
saw
great
times
and
late
hours
during
the
succeeding
week
the
two
earls
were
such
opposites
in
nature
that
they
fraternized
at
once
sellers
said
privately
that
rossmore
was
the
most
extraordinary
character
he
had
ever
met
a
man
just
made
out
of
the
condensed
milk
of
human
kindness
yet
with
the
ability
to
totally
hide
the
fact
from
any
but
the
most
practised
a
man
whose
whole
being
was
sweetness
patience
and
charity
yet
with
a
cunning
so
profound
an
ability
so
marvelous
in
the
acting
of
a
double
part
that
many
a
person
of
considerable
intelligence
might
live
with
him
for
centuries
and
never
suspect
the
presence
in
him
of
these
characteristics
finally
there
was
a
quiet
wedding
at
the
towers
instead
of
a
big
one
at
the
british
embassy
with
the
militia
and
the
fire
brigades
and
the
temperance
organizations
on
hand
in
torchlight
procession
as
at
first
proposed
by
one
of
the
earls
the
and
barrow
were
present
at
the
wedding
and
the
tinner
and
puss
had
been
invited
but
the
tinner
was
ill
and
puss
was
nursing
him
for
they
were
engaged
the
sellerses
were
to
go
to
england
with
their
new
allies
for
a
brief
visit
but
when
it
was
time
to
take
the
train
from
washington
the
colonel
was
missing
hawkins
was
going
as
far
as
new
york
with
the
party
and
said
he
would
explain
the
matter
on
the
road
the
explanation
was
in
a
letter
left
by
the
colonel
in
hawkins
hands
in
it
he
promised
to
join
mrs
sellers
later
in
england
and
then
went
on
to
say
the
truth
is
my
dear
hawkins
a
mighty
idea
has
been
born
to
me
within
the
hour
and
i
must
not
even
stop
to
say
goodbye
to
my
dear
ones
a
man
highest
duty
takes
precedence
of
all
minor
ones
and
must
be
attended
to
with
his
best
promptness
and
energy
at
whatsoever
cost
to
his
affections
or
his
convenience
and
first
of
all
a
man
duties
is
his
duty
to
his
own
honor
he
must
keep
that
spotless
mine
is
threatened
when
i
was
feeling
sure
of
my
imminent
future
solidity
i
forwarded
to
the
czar
of
russia
perhaps
prematurely
an
offer
for
the
purchase
of
siberia
naming
a
vast
sum
since
then
an
episode
has
warned
me
that
the
method
by
which
i
was
expecting
to
acquire
this
money
materialization
upon
a
scale
of
limitless
magnitude
is
marred
by
a
taint
of
temporary
uncertainty
his
imperial
majesty
may
accept
my
offer
at
any
moment
if
this
should
occur
now
i
should
find
myself
painfully
embarrassed
in
fact
financially
inadequate
i
could
not
take
siberia
this
would
become
known
and
my
credit
would
suffer
recently
my
private
hours
have
been
dark
indeed
but
the
sun
shines
again
now
i
see
my
way
i
shall
be
able
to
meet
my
obligation
and
without
having
to
ask
an
extension
of
the
stipulated
time
i
think
this
grand
new
idea
of
mine
the
sublimest
i
have
ever
conceived
will
save
me
whole
i
am
sure
i
am
leaving
for
san
francisco
this
moment
to
test
it
by
the
help
of
the
great
lick
telescope
like
all
of
my
more
notable
discoveries
and
inventions
it
is
based
upon
hard
practical
scientific
laws
all
other
bases
are
unsound
and
hence
untrustworthy
in
brief
then
i
have
conceived
the
stupendous
idea
of
reorganizing
the
climates
of
the
earth
according
to
the
desire
of
the
populations
interested
that
is
to
say
i
will
furnish
climates
to
order
for
cash
or
negotiable
paper
taking
the
old
climates
in
part
payment
of
course
at
a
fair
discount
where
they
are
in
condition
to
be
repaired
at
small
cost
and
let
out
for
hire
to
poor
and
remote
communities
not
able
to
afford
a
good
climate
and
not
caring
for
an
expensive
one
for
mere
display
my
studies
have
convinced
me
that
the
regulation
of
climates
and
the
breeding
of
new
varieties
at
will
from
the
old
stock
is
a
feasible
thing
indeed
i
am
convinced
that
it
has
been
done
before
done
in
prehistoric
times
by
now
forgotten
and
unrecorded
civilizations
everywhere
i
find
hoary
evidences
of
artificial
manipulation
of
climates
in
bygone
times
take
the
glacial
period
was
that
produced
by
accident
not
at
all
it
was
done
for
money
i
have
a
thousand
proofs
of
it
and
will
some
day
reveal
them
i
will
confide
to
you
an
outline
of
my
idea
it
is
to
utilize
the
spots
on
the
sun
get
control
of
them
you
understand
and
apply
the
stupendous
energies
which
they
wield
to
beneficent
purposes
in
the
reorganizing
of
our
climates
at
present
they
merely
make
trouble
and
do
harm
in
the
evoking
of
cyclones
and
other
kinds
of
electric
storms
but
once
under
humane
and
intelligent
control
this
will
cease
and
they
will
become
a
boon
to
man
i
have
my
plan
all
mapped
out
whereby
i
hope
and
expect
to
acquire
complete
and
perfect
control
of
the
also
details
of
the
method
whereby
i
shall
employ
the
same
commercially
but
i
will
not
venture
to
go
into
particulars
before
the
patents
shall
have
been
issued
i
shall
hope
and
expect
to
sell
to
the
minor
countries
at
a
reasonable
figure
and
supply
a
good
business
article
of
climate
to
the
great
empires
at
special
rates
together
with
fancy
brands
for
coronations
battles
and
other
great
and
particular
occasions
there
are
billions
of
money
in
this
enterprise
no
expensive
plant
is
required
and
i
shall
begin
to
realize
in
a
few
days
in
a
few
weeks
at
furthest
i
shall
stand
ready
to
pay
cash
for
siberia
the
moment
it
is
delivered
and
thus
save
my
honor
and
my
credit
i
am
confident
of
this
i
would
like
you
to
provide
a
proper
outfit
and
start
north
as
soon
as
i
telegraph
you
be
it
night
or
be
it
day
i
wish
you
to
take
up
all
the
country
stretching
away
from
the
north
pole
on
all
sides
for
many
degrees
south
and
buy
greenland
and
iceland
at
the
best
figure
you
can
get
now
while
they
are
cheap
it
is
my
intention
to
move
one
of
the
tropics
up
there
and
transfer
the
frigid
zone
to
the
equator
i
will
have
the
entire
arctic
circle
in
the
market
as
a
summer
resort
next
year
and
will
use
the
surplusage
of
the
old
climate
over
and
above
what
can
be
utilized
on
the
equator
to
reduce
the
temperature
of
opposition
resorts
but
i
have
said
enough
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
prodigious
nature
of
my
scheme
and
the
feasible
and
enormously
profitable
character
of
it
i
shall
join
all
you
happy
people
in
england
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
sold
out
some
of
my
principal
climates
and
arranged
with
the
czar
about
siberia
meantime
watch
for
a
sign
from
me
eight
days
from
now
we
shall
be
wide
asunder
for
i
shall
be
on
the
border
of
the
pacific
and
you
far
out
on
the
atlantic
approaching
england
that
day
if
i
am
alive
and
my
sublime
discovery
is
proved
and
established
i
will
send
you
greeting
and
my
messenger
shall
deliver
it
where
you
are
in
the
solitudes
of
the
sea
for
i
will
waft
a
vast
across
the
disk
like
drifting
smoke
and
you
will
know
it
for
my
and
will
say

wild

a

in
