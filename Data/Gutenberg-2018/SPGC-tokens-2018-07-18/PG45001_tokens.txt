the
presbyterian
board
of
publication
in
introducing
to
the
public
a
new
edition
of
the
inimitable
institutes
of
the
christian
religion
do
not
wish
to
be
regarded
as
adopting
all
the
sentiments
and
forms
of
expression
of
the
venerated
writer
although
they
agree
with
him
in
his
general
views
and
admire
the
skill
and
learning
with
which
he
has
pointed
out
the
relative
positions
and
bearings
of
the
great
doctrines
of
revelation
calvin
was
better
qualified
than
any
of
his
contemporaries
to
present
revealed
truth
in
a
connected
and
systematic
form
his
great
natural
abilities
his
profound
erudition
his
well
balanced
and
discriminating
judgment
and
his
habits
of
diligent
investigation
eminently
fitted
him
to
prepare
such
a
work
as
the
institutes
in
which
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
are
so
clearly
developed
and
harmonized
that
the
system
has
been
closely
associated
with
his
name
from
the
period
of
its
publication
until
the
present
time
the
honour
of
calvin
consisted
not
in
suggesting
ingenious
theories
and
speculations
but
in
his
general
accuracy
in
interpreting
the
holy
scriptures
and
in
detecting
and
pointing
out
the
connection
of
scripture
doctrines
which
instead
of
being
insulated
were
shown
to
occupy
their
respective
places
in
forming
a
complete
and
perfect
system
of
divine
truth
the
doctrines
embraced
in
the
formularies
of
the
presbyterian
church
are
termed
calvinistic
from
their
general
accordance
with
calvin
s
interpretation
of
scriptural
truth
but
the
admission
of
this
term
as
explanatory
of
their
general
character
is
not
understood
as
by
any
means
implying
an
entire
coincidence
in
the
views
of
calvin
or
a
submission
to
his
authority
as
an
umpire
in
theological
controversies
although
a
learned
and
pious
he
was
a
fallible
man
and
his
opinions
although
deserving
of
profound
respect
are
not
to
be
blindly
followed
while
admitting
that
the
institutes
considering
the
times
and
circumstances
in
which
they
were
written
form
an
invaluable
body
of
divinity
still
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
some
of
the
doctrines
therein
maintained
have
been
more
luminously
set
forth
in
modern
times
we
would
especially
mention
as
an
instance
the
doctrine
of
justification
through
the
imputed
righteousness
of
christ
some
of
the
expressions
of
calvin
on
the
subject
of
reprobation
may
be
regarded
as
too
unqualified
and
we
can
no
further
endorse
them
than
as
they
are
incorporated
in
the
presbyterian
confession
of
faith
the
most
decidedly
objectionable
feature
in
the
christian
institutes
is
to
be
found
in
the
explanation
of
the
fourth
commandment
where
the
author
asserts
the
abrogation
of
the
sabbath
in
calvin
s
view
this
ordinance
was
a
mere
type
of
better
blessings
and
with
the
types
and
ceremonies
of
the
old
dispensation
was
done
away
by
the
introduction
of
a
new
and
better
dispensation
in
this
opinion
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
greatly
erred
and
so
universal
is
the
conviction
of
the
church
on
the
perpetual
obligation
of
the
sabbath
as
a
moral
institution
that
no
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
from
a
contrary
view
even
under
the
sanction
of
so
great
a
name
as
that
of
calvin
in
justice
to
his
opinion
on
this
subject
however
it
should
be
stated
that
he
distinctly
recognized
not
only
the
propriety
but
the
necessity
of
a
consecration
of
stated
days
for
public
religious
services
without
which
regulation
he
declares
that
it
is
so
far
from
being
possible
to
preserve
order
and
decorum
that
if
it
were
abolished
the
church
would
be
in
imminent
danger
of
immediate
convulsion
and
it
is
much
to
be
lamented
that
so
great
a
mind
should
have
been
led
astray
on
so
important
a
point
by
attempting
to
avoid
an
opposite
extreme
the
board
of
publication
have
been
induced
to
undertake
this
edition
by
the
very
generous
offer
of
the
first
and
second
presbyterian
churches
in
baltimore
of
which
the
rev
john
backus
and
the
rev
breckinridge
are
respectively
pastors
to
defray
the
expense
of
stereotyping
the
work
under
the
direction
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
board
the
translation
has
been
diligently
compared
throughout
with
the
original
latin
and
french
and
various
corrections
have
been
made
to
convey
the
meaning
of
the
author
more
distinctly
and
accurately
this
laborious
duty
has
been
performed
by
a
member
of
the
publishing
committee
the
intrinsic
excellence
of
the
work
taken
in
connection
with
the
attractive
style
and
comparative
cheapness
of
the
present
edition
induces
the
committee
to
hope
that
it
may
be
widely
circulated
and
carefully
studied
both
by
the
clergy
and
laymen
of
the
presbyterian
church
in

of

committee
william
engles
editor
the
translator
s
preface
the
english
reader
is
here
presented
with
a
translation
of
one
of
the
principal
theological
productions
of
the
sixteenth
century
few
persons
into
whose
hands
this
translation
is
likely
to
fall
will
require
to
be
informed
that
the
author
of
the
original
work
was
one
of
an
illustrious
triumvirate
who
acted
a
most
conspicuous
part
in
what
has
been
generally
and
justly
denominated
the
reformation
of
that
important
revolution
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
so
necessary
to
the
interests
of
true
religion
and
productive
of
such
immense
advantages
even
to
civil
society
luther
zuingle
and
calvin
were
honoured
by
the
providence
of
god
to
be
the
most
highly
distinguished
instruments
it
is
no
degradation
to
the
memory
of
the
many
other
ornaments
of
that
age
to
consider
them
as
brilliant
satellites
in
the
firmament
of
the
church
revolving
round
these
primary
luminaries
to
whom
they
were
indebted
for
much
of
that
lustre
which
they
diffused
over
the
earth
while
they
were
all
together
revolving
around
one
and
the
same
common
centre
though
it
must
be
confessed
with
considerable
varieties
of
approximation
velocity
and
obliquity
in
their
courses
yet
all
deriving
more
or
less
copious
communications
of
light
from
the
great
sun
of
the
moral
system
the
true
light
of
the
world
differing
in
the
powers
of
their
minds
as
well
as
in
the
temperament
of
their
bodily
constitutions
placed
in
different
circumstances
and
called
to
act
in
different
scenes
these
leading
reformers
though
engaged
in
the
same
common
cause
displayed
their
characteristic
and
peculiar
excellences
which
it
is
no
disparagement
of
that
cause
to
admit
were
likewise
accompanied
by
peculiar
failings
it
is
not
the
design
of
this
preface
to
portray
and
discriminate
their
respective
characters
they
alike
devoted
their
lives
and
labours
to
rescue
christianity
from
the
absurdities
superstitions
and
vices
by
which
it
had
been
so
deplorably
deformed
mutilated
and
obscured
and
to
recall
the
attention
of
mankind
from
the
doubtful
traditions
of
men
to
the
unerring
word
of
god
but
while
they
were
all
distinguished
reformers
calvin
has
been
generally
acknowledged
to
have
been
the
most
eminent
theologian
of
the
three
such
was
the
superiority
of
the
talents
and
attainments
of
calvin
to
those
of
most
other
great
men
that
the
strictest
truth
is
in
danger
of
being
taken
for
exaggeration
it
is
impossible
for
any
candid
and
intelligent
person
to
have
even
a
slight
acquaintance
with
his
writings
without
admiring
his
various
knowledge
extensive
learning
profound
penetration
solid
judgment
acute
reasoning
pure
morality
and
fervent
piety
his
commentaries
on
the
scriptures
have
been
celebrated
for
a
juster
method
of
exposition
than
had
been
exhibited
by
any
preceding
writer
above
a
hundred
years
after
his
death
poole
the
author
of
the
synopsis
in
the
preface
to
that
valuable
work
says
calvin
s
commentaries
abound
in
solid
discussions
of
theological
subjects
and
practical
improvements
of
them
subsequent
writers
have
borrowed
most
of
their
materials
from
calvin
and
his
interpretations
adorn
the
books
even
of
those
who
repay
the
obligation
by
reproaching
their
and
nothing
can
more
satisfactorily
evince
the
high
estimation
to
which
they
are
still
entitled
from
the
biblical
student
than
the
following
testimony
given
after
the
lapse
of
another
century
by
the
late
learned
bishop
horsley
i
hold
the
memory
of
calvin
in
high
veneration
his
works
have
a
place
in
my
library
and
in
the
study
of
the
holy
scriptures
he
is
one
of
the
commentators
whom
i
frequently
but
perhaps
of
all
the
writings
of
calvin
none
has
excited
so
much
attention
as
his
institutes
of
the
christian
religion
his
original
design
in
commencing
this
work
is
stated
by
himself
in
the
beginning
of
his
dedication
to
have
been
to
supply
his
countrymen
the
french
with
an
elementary
compendium
for
their
instruction
in
the
principles
of
true
religion
but
we
learn
from
beza
that
by
the
time
of
its
completion
existing
circumstances
furnished
the
author
with
an
additional
motive
for
sending
it
into
the
world
during
his
residence
at
basil
whither
he
had
retired
to
avoid
the
persecution
which
was
then
raging
in
france
against
all
the
dissentients
from
the
church
of
rome
francis
the
first
king
of
france
courted
the
friendship
of
the
protestant
princes
of
germany
and
knowing
their
detestation
of
the
cruelties
which
he
employed
against
his
subjects
of
the
reformed
religion
he
endeavoured
to
excuse
his
conduct
by
alleging
that
he
caused
none
to
be
put
to
death
except
some
few
fanatics
who
so
far
from
taking
the
word
of
god
as
the
rule
of
their
faith
gave
themselves
up
to
the
impulses
of
their
disordered
imaginations
and
even
openly
avowed
a
contempt
of
magistrates
and
sovereign
princes
unable
to
bear
such
foul
aspersions
of
his
brethren
calvin
determined
on
the
immediate
publication
of
this
treatise
which
he
thought
would
serve
as
an
answer
to
the
calumnies
circulated
by
the
enemies
of
the
truth
and
as
an
apology
for
his
pious
and
persecuted
countrymen
the
dedication
to
francis
is
one
of
the
most
masterly
compositions
of
modern
times
the
purity
elegance
and
energy
of
style
the
bold
yet
respectful
freedom
of
address
the
firm
attachment
to
the
divine
word
the
christian
fortitude
in
the
midst
of
persecution
the
triumphant
refutation
of
the
calumnies
of
detractors
with
other
qualities
which
distinguish
this
celebrated
remonstrance
will
surely
permit
no
reader
of
taste
or
piety
to
withhold
his
concurrence
from
the
general
admiration
which
it
has
received
the
author
composed
this
treatise
in
latin
and
french
and
though
at
its
first
appearance
it
was
little
more
than
an
outline
of
what
it
afterwards
became
it
was
received
with
uncommon
approbation
and
a
second
edition
of
it
was
soon
required
how
many
editions
it
passed
through
during
his
life
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
now
to
ascertain
but
it
obtained
a
very
extensive
circulation
and
was
reprinted
several
times
and
every
time
was
further
improved
and
enlarged
by
him
till
in
the
year
years
after
the
first
impression
he
put
the
finishing
hand
to
his
work
and
published
it
in
latin
and
french
with
his
last
corrections
and
additions
the
circulation
which
it
enjoyed
was
not
confined
to
persons
capable
of
reading
it
in
the
languages
in
which
it
was
written
it
was
translated
into
high
dutch
low
dutch
italian
and
spanish
soon
after
the
publication
of
the
author
s
last
edition
it
was
translated
from
the
latin
into
english
in
this
language
it
appears
to
have
reached
six
editions
in
the
life
of
the
translator
a
reflection
on
the
small
number
of
persons
who
may
be
supposed
to
have
had
inclination
and
ability
to
read
such
a
book
at
that
period
compared
with
the
number
of
readers
in
the
present
age
may
excite
some
wonder
that
there
should
have
been
a
demand
for
so
many
editions
but
no
surprise
at
this
circumstance
will
be
felt
by
any
person
acquainted
with
the
high
estimation
in
which
the
works
of
the
author
were
held
by
the
venerable
reformers
of
the
church
of
england
and
their
immediate
successors
as
well
as
by
the
great
majority
of
religious
people
in
this
country
this
is
not
a
question
of
opinion
but
an
undeniable
fact
heylin
the
admirer
and
biographer
of
archbishop
laud
speaking
of
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
says
that
calvin
s
book
of
institutes
was
for
the
most
part
the
foundation
on
which
the
young
divines
of
those
times
did
build
their
the
great
saunderson
who
was
chaplain
to
king
charles
and
after
the
restoration
of
charles
was
created
bishop
of
lincoln
says
when
i
began
to
set
myself
to
the
study
of
divinity
as
my
proper
business
calvin
s
institutions
were
recommended
to
me
as
they
were
generally
to
all
young
scholars
in
those
times
as
the
best
and
perfectest
system
of
divinity
and
the
fittest
to
be
laid
as
a
in
the
study
of
this
profession
and
indeed
my
expectation
was
not
at
all
deceived
in
the
reading
of
those
the
great
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
our
language
render
it
difficult
to
form
a
correct
opinion
of
the
merits
of
norton
s
translation
which
was
first
published
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
it
must
give
rather
a
favourable
idea
of
its
execution
that
it
was
carefully
revised
by
the
rev
david
whitehead
a
man
of
learning
and
piety
who
in
the
reign
of
henry
was
nominated
by
archbishop
cranmer
to
a
bishopric
in
ireland
and
soon
after
the
accession
of
queen
elizabeth
was
solicited
by
that
princess
to
fill
the
metropolitan
see
of
canterbury
but
declined
the
preferment
but
whatever
were
the
merits
or
defects
of
that
translation
at
its
first
appearance
it
has
long
been
too
antiquated
uncouth
and
obscure
to
convey
any
just
idea
of
the
original
work
and
abounds
with
passages
which
to
the
modern
english
reader
can
not
but
be
altogether
unintelligible
the
intrinsic
excellence
of
the
book
its
importance
in
the
history
of
theological
controversy
the
celebrity
of
the
author
the
application
of
his
name
to
designate
the
leading
principles
of
the
system
he
maintained
and
the
frequent
collision
of
sentiment
respecting
various
parts
of
that
system
combine
with
other
considerations
to
render
it
a
matter
of
wonder
that
it
has
not
long
ago
been
given
to
the
english
public
in
a
new
dress
the
importance
of
it
has
also
been
much
increased
by
the
recent
controversy
respecting
calvinism
commenced
by
tomline
the
present
bishop
of
lincoln
in
which
such
direct
and
copious
reference
has
been
made
to
the
writings
of
this
reformer
and
especially
to
his
christian
institutes
these
circumstances
and
considerations
have
led
to
the
present
translation
and
publication
which
from
the
very
respectable
encouragement
it
has
received
the
translator
trusts
will
be
regarded
as
an
acceptable
service
to
the
religious
public
among
the
different
methods
of
translation
which
have
been
recommended
he
has
adopted
that
which
appeared
to
him
best
fitted
to
the
present
undertaking
a
servile
adherence
to
the
letter
of
the
original
the
style
of
which
is
so
very
remote
from
the
english
idiom
he
thought
would
convey
a
very
inadequate
representation
of
the
work
such
extreme
fidelity
to
use
an
expression
of
cowper
s
being
seldom
successful
even
in
a
faithful
transmission
of
the
precise
sentiments
of
the
author
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
a
mere
attention
to
the
ideas
and
sentiments
of
the
original
to
the
neglect
of
its
style
and
manner
would
expose
the
translator
of
a
treatise
of
this
nature
to
no
small
danger
of
misrepresenting
the
meaning
of
the
author
by
too
frequent
and
unnecessary
deviations
from
his
language
he
has
therefore
aimed
at
a
medium
between
servility
and
looseness
and
endeavoured
to
follow
the
style
of
the
original
as
far
as
the
respective
idioms
of
the
latin
and
english
would
admit
after
the
greater
part
of
the
work
had
been
translated
he
had
the
happiness
to
meet
with
an
edition
in
french
of
which
he
has
availed
himself
in
translating
the
remainder
and
in
the
revision
of
what
he
had
translated
before
every
person
who
understands
any
two
languages
will
be
aware
that
the
ambiguity
of
one
will
sometimes
be
explained
by
the
precision
of
another
and
notwithstanding
the
acknowledged
superiority
of
the
latin
to
the
french
in
most
of
the
qualities
which
constitute
the
excellence
of
a
language
the
case
of
the
article
is
not
the
only
one
in
which
calvin
s
french
elucidates
his
latin
the
scriptural
quotations
which
occur
in
the
work
the
translator
has
given
generally
in
the
words
of
our
common
english
version
sometimes
according
to
the
readings
in
the
margin
of
that
version
and
in
a
few
instances
he
has
literally
translated
the
version
adopted
by
the
author
where
the
context
required
his
peculiar
reading
to
be
preserved
almost
all
the
writers
of
that
age
writing
chiefly
in
a
dead
language
were
accustomed
to
speak
of
their
adversaries
in
language
which
the
polished
manners
of
the
modern
times
have
discarded
and
which
would
now
be
deemed
illiberal
and
scurrilous
where
these
cases
occur
the
translator
has
not
thought
himself
bound
to
a
literal
rendering
of
every
word
or
at
liberty
to
refine
them
entirely
away
but
has
adopted
such
expressions
as
he
apprehends
will
give
a
faithful
representation
of
the
spirit
of
the
author
to
modern
readers
intending
this
work
as
a
complete
system
of
theology
the
author
has
made
it
the
repository
of
his
sentiments
on
all
points
of
faith
and
practice
the
whole
being
distributed
into
four
parts
in
conformity
to
the
apostles
creed
and
this
plan
being
very
different
from
that
of
most
other
bodies
of
divinity
the
translator
has
borrowed
from
the
latin
edition
of
amsterdam
a
very
perspicuous
general
syllabus
which
will
give
the
reader
a
clear
view
of
the
original
design
and
plan
of
the
treatise
he
would
not
be
understood
to
represent
these
institutes
as
a
perfect
summary
of
christian
doctrines
and
morals
or
to
profess
an
unqualified
approbation
of
all
the
sentiments
they
contain
this
is
a
homage
to
which
no
uninspired
writings
can
ever
be
entitled
but
the
simplicity
of
the
method
the
freedom
from
the
barbarous
terms
captious
questions
minute
distinctions
and
intricate
subtilties
of
many
other
divines
the
clearness
and
closeness
of
argument
the
complete
refutation
of
the
advocates
of
the
romish
church
sometimes
by
obvious
conclusions
from
their
professed
principles
sometimes
by
clear
proofs
of
the
absurdities
they
involve
the
intimate
knowledge
of
ecclesiastical
history
the
intimate
acquaintance
with
former
theological
controversies
the
perspicuity
of
scriptural
interpretation
and
the
uniform
spirit
of
genuine
piety
which
pervade
the
book
can
not
escape
the
observation
of
any
judicious
reader
it
has
been
advised
by
some
persons
that
the
translation
should
be
accompanied
by
a
few
notes
to
elucidate
and
enforce
some
passages
and
to
correct
others
but
on
all
the
consideration
which
the
translator
has
been
able
to
give
to
this
subject
he
has
thought
it
would
be
best
to
content
himself
with
the
humble
office
of
placing
the
sentiments
of
calvin
before
the
reader
with
all
the
fidelity
in
his
power
without
any
addition
or
limitation
he
hopes
that
the
present
publication
will
serve
the
cause
of
true
religion
and
that
the
reputation
of
the
work
itself
will
sustain
no
diminution
from
the
form
in
which
it
now
appears
london
the
author
s
preface
to
an
edition
published
in
the
year
with
his
last
corrections
and
additions
in
the
first
edition
of
this
work
not
expecting
that
success
which
the
lord
in
his
infinite
goodness
hath
given
i
handled
the
subject
for
the
most
part
in
a
superficial
manner
as
is
usual
in
small
treatises
but
when
i
understood
that
it
had
obtained
from
almost
all
pious
persons
such
a
favourable
acceptance
as
i
never
could
have
presumed
to
wish
much
less
to
hope
while
i
was
conscious
of
receiving
far
more
attention
than
i
had
deserved
i
thought
it
would
evince
great
ingratitude
if
i
did
not
endeavour
at
least
according
to
my
humble
ability
to
make
some
suitable
return
for
the
attentions
paid
to
of
themselves
calculated
to
stimulate
my
industry
nor
did
i
attempt
this
only
in
the
second
edition
but
in
every
succeeding
one
the
work
has
been
improved
by
some
further
enlargements
but
though
i
repented
not
the
labour
then
devoted
to
it
yet
i
never
satisfied
myself
till
it
was
arranged
in
the
order
in
which
it
is
now
published
and
i
trust
i
have
here
presented
to
my
readers
what
their
judgments
will
unite
in
approving
of
my
diligent
application
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
service
for
the
church
of
god
i
can
produce
abundant
proof
for
last
winter
when
i
thought
that
a
quartan
ague
would
speedily
terminate
in
my
death
the
more
my
disorder
increased
the
less
i
spared
myself
till
i
had
finished
this
book
to
leave
it
behind
me
as
some
grateful
return
to
such
kind
solicitations
of
the
religious
public
indeed
i
would
rather
it
had
been
done
sooner
but
it
is
soon
enough
if
well
enough
i
shall
think
it
has
appeared
at
the
proper
time
when
i
shall
find
it
to
have
been
more
beneficial
than
before
to
the
church
of
god
this
is
my
only
wish
i
should
indeed
be
ill
requited
for
my
labour
if
i
did
not
content
myself
with
the
approbation
of
god
alone
despising
equally
the
foolish
and
perverse
judgments
of
ignorant
men
and
the
calumnies
and
detractions
of
the
wicked
for
though
god
hath
wholly
devoted
my
mind
to
study
the
enlargement
of
his
kingdom
and
the
promotion
of
general
usefulness
and
i
have
the
testimony
of
my
own
conscience
of
angels
and
of
god
himself
that
since
i
undertook
the
office
of
a
teacher
in
the
church
i
have
had
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
profit
the
church
by
maintaining
the
pure
doctrine
of
godliness
yet
i
suppose
there
is
no
man
more
slandered
or
calumniated
than
myself
when
this
preface
was
actually
in
the
press
i
had
certain
information
that
at
augsburg
where
the
states
of
the
empire
were
assembled
a
report
had
been
circulated
of
my
defection
to
popery
and
received
with
unbecoming
eagerness
in
the
courts
of
the
princes
this
is
the
gratitude
of
those
who
can
not
be
unacquainted
with
the
numerous
proofs
of
my
constancy
which
not
only
refute
such
a
foul
calumny
but
with
all
equitable
and
humane
judges
ought
to
preserve
me
from
it
but
the
devil
with
all
his
host
is
deceived
if
he
think
to
overwhelm
me
with
vile
falsehoods
or
to
render
me
more
timid
indolent
or
dilatory
by
such
indignities
for
i
trust
that
god
in
his
infinite
goodness
will
enable
me
to
persevere
with
patient
constancy
in
the
career
of
his
holy
calling
of
which
i
afford
my
pious
readers
a
fresh
proof
in
this
edition
now
my
design
in
this
work
has
been
to
prepare
and
qualify
students
of
theology
for
the
reading
of
the
divine
word
that
they
may
have
an
easy
introduction
to
it
and
be
enabled
to
proceed
in
it
without
any
obstruction
for
i
think
i
have
given
such
a
comprehensive
summary
and
orderly
arrangement
of
all
the
branches
of
religion
that
with
proper
attention
no
person
will
find
any
difficulty
in
determining
what
ought
to
be
the
principal
objects
of
his
research
in
the
scripture
and
to
what
end
he
ought
to
refer
any
thing
it
contains
this
way
therefore
being
prepared
if
i
should
hereafter
publish
any
expositions
of
the
scripture
i
shall
have
no
need
to
introduce
long
discussions
respecting
doctrines
or
digressions
on
common
topics
and
therefore
shall
always
compress
them
within
a
narrow
compass
this
will
relieve
the
pious
reader
from
great
trouble
and
tediousness
provided
he
come
previously
furnished
with
the
necessary
information
by
a
knowledge
of
the
present
work
but
as
the
reason
of
this
design
is
very
evident
in
my
numerous
commentaries
i
would
rather
have
it
known
from
the
fact
itself
than
from
my
declaration
farewell
friendly
reader
and
if
you
receive
any
benefit
from
my
labours
let
me
have
the
assistance
of
your
prayers
with
god
our
father
geneva
august
dedication
his
most
christian
francis
of
the
french
and
his
sovereign
john
calvin
wisheth
peace
and
salvation
in
when
i
began
this
work
sire
nothing
was
further
from
my
thoughts
than
writing
a
book
which
would
afterwards
be
presented
to
your
majesty
my
intention
was
only
to
lay
down
some
elementary
principles
by
which
inquirers
on
the
subject
of
religion
might
be
instructed
in
the
nature
of
true
piety
and
this
labour
i
undertook
chiefly
for
my
countrymen
the
french
of
whom
i
apprehended
multitudes
to
be
hungering
and
thirsting
after
christ
but
saw
very
few
possessing
any
real
knowledge
of
him
that
this
was
my
design
the
book
itself
proves
by
its
simple
method
and
unadorned
composition
but
when
i
perceived
that
the
fury
of
certain
wicked
men
in
your
kingdom
had
grown
to
such
a
height
as
to
leave
no
room
in
the
land
for
sound
doctrine
i
thought
i
should
be
usefully
employed
if
in
the
same
work
i
delivered
my
instructions
to
them
and
exhibited
my
confession
to
you
that
you
may
know
the
nature
of
that
doctrine
which
is
the
object
of
such
unbounded
rage
to
those
madmen
who
are
now
disturbing
the
country
with
fire
and
sword
for
i
shall
not
be
afraid
to
acknowledge
that
this
treatise
contains
a
summary
of
that
very
doctrine
which
according
to
their
clamours
deserves
to
be
punished
with
imprisonment
banishment
proscription
and
flames
and
to
be
exterminated
from
the
face
of
the
earth
i
well
know
with
what
atrocious
insinuations
your
ears
have
been
filled
by
them
in
order
to
render
our
cause
most
odious
in
your
esteem
but
your
clemency
should
lead
you
to
consider
that
if
accusation
be
accounted
a
sufficient
evidence
of
guilt
there
will
be
an
end
of
all
innocence
in
words
and
actions
if
any
one
indeed
with
a
view
to
bring
an
odium
upon
the
doctrine
which
i
am
endeavouring
to
defend
should
allege
that
it
has
long
ago
been
condemned
by
the
general
consent
and
suppressed
by
many
judicial
decisions
this
will
be
only
equivalent
to
saying
that
it
has
been
sometimes
violently
rejected
through
the
influence
and
power
of
its
adversaries
and
sometimes
insidiously
and
fraudulently
oppressed
by
falsehoods
artifices
and
calumnies
violence
is
displayed
when
sanguinary
sentences
are
passed
against
it
without
the
cause
being
heard
and
fraud
when
it
is
unjustly
accused
of
sedition
and
mischief
lest
any
one
should
suppose
that
these
our
complaints
are
unfounded
you
yourself
sire
can
bear
witness
of
the
false
calumnies
with
which
you
hear
it
daily
traduced
that
its
only
tendency
is
to
wrest
the
sceptres
of
kings
out
of
their
hands
to
overturn
all
the
tribunals
and
judicial
proceedings
to
subvert
all
order
and
governments
to
disturb
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
people
to
abrogate
all
laws
to
scatter
all
properties
and
possessions
and
in
a
word
to
involve
every
thing
in
total
confusion
and
yet
you
hear
the
smallest
portion
of
what
is
alleged
against
it
for
such
horrible
things
are
circulated
amongst
the
vulgar
that
if
they
were
true
the
whole
world
would
justly
pronounce
it
and
its
abettors
worthy
of
a
thousand
fires
and
gibbets
who
then
will
wonder
at
its
becoming
the
object
of
public
odium
where
credit
is
given
to
such
most
iniquitous
accusations
this
is
the
cause
of
the
general
consent
and
conspiracy
to
condemn
us
and
our
doctrine
hurried
away
with
this
impulse
those
who
sit
in
judgment
pronounce
for
sentences
the
prejudices
they
brought
from
home
with
them
and
think
their
duty
fully
discharged
if
they
condemn
none
to
be
punished
but
such
as
are
convicted
by
their
own
confession
or
by
sufficient
proofs
convicted
of
what
crime
of
this
condemned
doctrine
they
say
but
with
what
justice
is
it
condemned
now
the
ground
of
defence
was
not
to
abjure
the
doctrine
itself
but
to
maintain
its
truth
on
this
subject
however
not
a
word
is
allowed
to
be
uttered
wherefore
i
beseech
you
sire
surely
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
request
take
upon
yourself
the
entire
cognizance
of
this
cause
which
has
hitherto
been
confusedly
and
carelessly
agitated
without
any
order
of
law
and
with
outrageous
passion
rather
than
judicial
gravity
think
not
that
i
am
now
meditating
my
own
individual
defence
in
order
to
effect
a
safe
return
to
my
native
country
for
though
i
feel
the
affection
which
every
man
ought
to
feel
for
it
yet
under
the
existing
circumstances
i
regret
not
my
removal
from
it
but
i
plead
the
cause
of
all
the
godly
and
consequently
of
christ
himself
which
having
been
in
these
times
persecuted
and
trampled
on
in
all
ways
in
your
kingdom
now
lies
in
a
most
deplorable
state
and
this
indeed
rather
through
the
tyranny
of
certain
pharisees
than
with
your
knowledge
how
this
comes
to
pass
is
foreign
to
my
present
purpose
to
say
but
it
certainly
lies
in
a
most
afflicted
state
for
the
ungodly
have
gone
to
such
lengths
that
the
truth
of
christ
if
not
vanquished
dissipated
and
entirely
destroyed
is
buried
as
it
were
in
ignoble
obscurity
while
the
poor
despised
church
is
either
destroyed
by
cruel
massacres
or
driven
away
into
banishment
or
menaced
and
terrified
into
total
silence
and
still
they
continue
their
wonted
madness
and
ferocity
pushing
violently
against
the
wall
already
bent
and
finishing
the
ruin
they
have
begun
in
the
mean
time
no
one
comes
forward
to
plead
the
cause
against
such
furies
if
there
be
any
persons
desirous
of
appearing
most
favourable
to
the
truth
they
only
venture
an
opinion
that
forgiveness
should
be
extended
to
the
error
and
imprudence
of
ignorant
people
for
this
is
the
language
of
these
moderate
men
calling
error
and
imprudence
which
they
know
to
be
the
certain
truth
of
god
and
ignorant
people
whose
understanding
they
perceive
not
to
have
been
so
despicable
to
christ
but
that
he
has
favoured
them
with
the
mysteries
of
his
heavenly
wisdom
thus
all
are
ashamed
of
the
gospel
but
it
shall
be
yours
sire
not
to
turn
away
your
ears
or
thoughts
from
so
just
a
defence
especially
in
a
cause
of
such
importance
as
the
maintenance
of
god
s
glory
unimpaired
in
the
world
the
preservation
of
the
honour
of
divine
truth
and
the
continuance
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
uninjured
among
us
this
is
a
cause
worthy
of
your
attention
worthy
of
your
cognizance
worthy
of
your
throne
this
consideration
constitutes
true
royalty
to
acknowledge
yourself
in
the
government
of
your
kingdom
to
be
the
minister
of
god
for
where
the
glory
of
god
is
not
made
the
end
of
the
government
it
is
not
a
legitimate
sovereignty
but
a
usurpation
and
he
is
deceived
who
expects
lasting
prosperity
in
that
kingdom
which
is
not
ruled
by
the
sceptre
of
god
that
is
his
holy
word
for
that
heavenly
oracle
can
not
fail
which
declares
that
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
nor
should
you
be
seduced
from
this
pursuit
by
a
contempt
of
our
meanness
we
are
fully
conscious
to
ourselves
how
very
mean
and
abject
we
are
being
miserable
sinners
before
god
and
accounted
most
despicable
by
men
being
if
you
please
the
refuse
of
the
world
deserving
of
the
vilest
appellations
that
can
be
found
so
that
nothing
remains
for
us
to
glory
in
before
god
but
his
mercy
alone
by
which
without
any
merit
of
ours
we
have
been
admitted
to
the
hope
of
eternal
salvation
and
before
men
nothing
but
our
weakness
the
slightest
confession
of
which
is
esteemed
by
them
as
the
greatest
disgrace
but
our
doctrine
must
stand
exalted
above
all
the
glory
and
invincible
by
all
the
power
of
the
world
because
it
is
not
ours
but
the
doctrine
of
the
living
god
and
of
his
christ
whom
the
father
hath
constituted
king
that
he
may
have
dominion
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
river
even
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
that
he
may
rule
in
such
a
manner
that
the
whole
earth
with
its
strength
of
iron
and
with
its
splendour
of
gold
and
silver
smitten
by
the
rod
of
his
mouth
may
be
broken
to
pieces
like
a
potter
s
vessel
for
thus
do
the
prophets
foretell
the
magnificence
of
his
kingdom
our
adversaries
reply
that
our
pleading
the
word
of
god
is
a
false
pretence
and
that
we
are
nefarious
corrupters
of
it
but
that
this
is
not
only
a
malicious
calumny
but
egregious
impudence
by
reading
our
confession
you
will
in
your
wisdom
be
able
to
judge
yet
something
further
is
necessary
to
be
said
to
excite
your
attention
or
at
least
to
prepare
your
mind
for
this
perusal
paul
s
direction
that
every
prophecy
be
framed
according
to
the
analogy
of
faith
has
fixed
an
invariable
standard
by
which
all
interpretation
of
scripture
ought
to
be
tried
if
our
principles
be
examined
by
this
rule
of
faith
the
victory
is
ours
for
what
is
more
consistent
with
faith
than
to
acknowledge
ourselves
naked
of
all
virtue
that
we
may
be
clothed
by
god
empty
of
all
good
that
we
may
be
filled
by
him
slaves
to
sin
that
we
may
be
liberated
by
him
blind
that
we
may
be
enlightened
by
him
lame
that
we
may
be
guided
weak
that
we
may
be
supported
by
him
to
divest
ourselves
of
all
ground
of
glorying
that
he
alone
may
be
eminently
glorious
and
that
we
may
glory
in
him
when
we
advance
these
and
similar
sentiments
they
interrupt
us
with
complaints
that
this
is
the
way
to
overturn
i
know
not
what
blind
light
of
nature
pretended
preparations
free
will
and
works
meritorious
of
eternal
salvation
together
with
all
their
supererogations
because
they
can
not
bear
that
the
praise
and
glory
of
all
goodness
strength
righteousness
and
wisdom
should
remain
entirely
with
god
but
we
read
of
none
being
reproved
for
having
drawn
too
freely
from
the
fountain
of
living
waters
on
the
contrary
they
are
severely
upbraided
who
have
hewed
them
out
cisterns
broken
cisterns
that
can
hold
no
again
what
is
more
consistent
with
faith
than
to
assure
ourselves
of
god
being
a
propitious
father
where
christ
is
acknowledged
as
a
brother
and
mediator
than
securely
to
expect
all
prosperity
and
happiness
from
him
whose
unspeakable
love
towards
us
went
so
far
that
he
spared
not
his
own
son
but
delivered
him
up
for
us
than
to
rest
in
the
certain
expectation
of
salvation
and
eternal
life
when
we
reflect
upon
the
father
s
gift
of
christ
in
whom
such
treasures
are
hidden
here
they
oppose
us
and
complain
that
this
certainty
of
confidence
is
chargeable
with
arrogance
and
presumption
but
as
we
ought
to
presume
nothing
of
ourselves
so
we
should
presume
every
thing
of
god
nor
are
we
divested
of
vain
glory
for
any
other
reason
than
that
we
may
learn
to
glory
in
the
lord
what
shall
i
say
more
review
sire
all
the
parts
of
our
cause
and
consider
us
worse
than
the
most
abandoned
of
mankind
unless
you
clearly
discover
that
we
thus
both
labour
and
suffer
reproach
because
we
trust
in
the
living
god
because
we
believe
that
this
is
life
eternal
to
know
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
he
hath
for
this
hope
some
of
us
are
bound
in
chains
others
are
lashed
with
scourges
others
are
carried
about
as
others
are
outlawed
others
are
cruelly
tortured
others
escape
by
flight
but
we
are
all
reduced
to
extreme
perplexities
execrated
with
dreadful
curses
cruelly
slandered
and
treated
with
the
greatest
indignities
now
look
at
our
adversaries
i
speak
of
the
order
of
priests
at
whose
will
and
directions
others
carry
on
these
hostilities
against
us
and
consider
a
little
with
me
by
what
principles
they
are
actuated
the
true
religion
which
is
taught
in
the
scriptures
and
ought
to
be
universally
maintained
they
readily
permit
both
themselves
and
others
to
be
ignorant
of
and
to
treat
with
neglect
and
contempt
they
think
it
unimportant
what
any
one
holds
or
denies
concerning
god
and
christ
provided
he
submits
his
mind
with
an
implicit
faith
as
they
call
it
to
the
judgment
of
the
church
nor
are
they
much
affected
if
the
glory
of
god
happens
to
be
violated
with
open
blasphemies
provided
no
one
lift
a
finger
against
the
primacy
of
the
apostolic
see
and
the
authority
of
their
holy
mother
church
why
therefore
do
they
contend
with
such
extreme
bitterness
and
cruelty
for
the
mass
purgatory
pilgrimages
and
similar
trifles
and
deny
that
any
piety
can
be
maintained
without
a
most
explicit
faith
so
to
speak
in
these
things
whereas
they
prove
none
of
them
from
the
word
of
god
why
but
because
their
belly
is
their
god
their
kitchen
is
their
religion
deprived
of
which
they
consider
themselves
no
longer
as
christians
or
even
as
men
for
though
some
feast
themselves
in
splendour
and
others
subsist
on
slender
fare
yet
all
live
on
the
same
pot
which
without
this
fuel
would
not
only
cool
but
completely
freeze
every
one
of
them
therefore
who
is
most
solicitous
for
his
belly
is
found
to
be
a
most
strenuous
champion
for
their
faith
indeed
they
universally
exert
themselves
for
the
preservation
of
their
kingdom
and
the
repletion
of
their
bellies
but
not
one
of
them
discovers
the
least
indication
of
sincere
zeal
nor
do
their
attacks
on
our
doctrine
cease
here
they
urge
every
topic
of
accusation
and
abuse
to
render
it
an
object
of
hatred
or
suspicion
they
call
it
novel
and
of
recent
origin
cavil
at
it
as
doubtful
and
uncertain
inquire
by
what
miracles
it
is
confirmed
ask
whether
it
is
right
for
it
to
be
received
contrary
to
the
consent
of
so
many
holy
fathers
and
the
custom
of
the
highest
antiquity
urge
us
to
confess
that
it
is
schismatical
in
stirring
up
opposition
against
the
church
or
that
the
church
was
wholly
extinct
for
many
ages
during
which
no
such
thing
was
they
say
all
arguments
are
unnecessary
for
that
its
nature
may
be
determined
by
its
fruits
since
it
has
produced
such
a
multitude
of
sects
so
many
factious
tumults
and
such
great
licentiousness
of
vices
it
is
indeed
very
easy
for
them
to
insult
a
deserted
cause
with
the
credulous
and
ignorant
multitude
but
if
we
had
also
the
liberty
of
speaking
in
our
turn
this
acrimony
which
they
now
discover
in
violently
foaming
against
us
with
equal
licentiousness
and
impunity
would
presently
cool
in
the
first
place
their
calling
it
novel
is
highly
injurious
to
god
whose
holy
word
deserves
not
to
be
accused
of
novelty
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
being
new
to
them
to
whom
jesus
christ
and
the
gospel
are
equally
new
but
those
who
know
the
antiquity
of
this
preaching
of
paul
that
jesus
christ
died
for
our
sins
and
rose
again
for
our
justification
will
find
no
novelty
among
us
that
it
has
long
been
concealed
buried
and
unknown
is
the
crime
of
human
impiety
now
that
the
goodness
of
god
has
restored
it
to
us
it
ought
at
least
to
be
allowed
its
just
claim
of
antiquity
from
the
same
source
of
ignorance
springs
the
notion
of
its
being
doubtful
and
uncertain
this
is
the
very
thing
which
the
lord
complains
of
by
his
prophet
that
the
ox
knoweth
his
owner
and
the
ass
his
master
s
crib
but
that
his
people
know
not
him
but
however
they
may
laugh
at
its
uncertainty
if
they
were
called
to
seal
their
own
doctrine
with
their
blood
and
lives
it
would
appear
how
much
they
value
it
very
different
is
our
confidence
which
dreads
neither
the
terrors
of
death
nor
even
the
tribunal
of
god
their
requiring
miracles
of
us
is
altogether
unreasonable
for
we
forge
no
new
gospel
but
retain
the
very
same
whose
truth
was
confirmed
by
all
the
miracles
ever
wrought
by
christ
and
the
apostles
but
they
have
this
peculiar
advantage
above
us
that
they
can
confirm
their
faith
by
continual
miracles
even
to
this
day
but
the
truth
is
they
allege
miracles
which
are
calculated
to
unsettle
a
mind
otherwise
well
established
they
are
so
frivolous
and
ridiculous
or
vain
and
false
nor
if
they
were
ever
so
preternatural
ought
they
to
have
any
weight
in
opposition
to
the
truth
of
god
since
the
name
of
god
ought
to
be
sanctified
in
all
places
and
at
all
times
whether
by
miraculous
events
or
by
the
common
order
of
nature
this
fallacy
might
perhaps
be
more
specious
if
the
scripture
did
not
apprize
us
of
the
legitimate
end
and
use
of
miracles
for
mark
informs
us
that
the
miracles
which
followed
the
preaching
of
the
apostles
were
wrought
in
confirmation
of
it
and
luke
tells
us
that
the
lord
gave
testimony
to
the
word
of
his
grace
when
signs
and
wonders
were
done
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
very
similar
to
which
is
the
assertion
of
the
apostle
that
salvation
was
confirmed
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
god
also
bearing
witness
with
signs
and
wonders
and
divers
but
those
things
which
we
are
told
were
seals
of
the
gospel
shall
we
pervert
to
undermine
the
faith
of
the
gospel
those
things
which
were
designed
to
be
testimonials
of
the
truth
shall
we
accommodate
to
the
confirmation
of
falsehood
it
is
right
therefore
that
the
doctrine
which
according
to
the
evangelist
claims
the
first
attention
be
examined
and
tried
in
the
first
place
and
if
it
be
approved
then
it
ought
to
derive
confirmation
from
miracles
but
it
is
the
characteristic
of
sound
doctrine
given
by
christ
that
it
tends
to
promote
not
the
glory
of
men
but
the
glory
of
god
christ
having
laid
down
this
proof
of
a
doctrine
it
is
wrong
to
esteem
those
as
miracles
which
are
directed
to
any
other
end
than
the
glorification
of
the
name
of
god
alone
and
we
should
remember
that
satan
has
his
wonders
which
though
they
are
juggling
tricks
rather
than
real
miracles
are
such
as
to
delude
the
ignorant
and
inexperienced
magicians
and
enchanters
have
always
been
famous
for
miracles
idolatry
has
been
supported
by
astonishing
miracles
and
yet
we
admit
them
not
as
proofs
of
the
superstition
of
magicians
or
idolaters
with
this
engine
also
the
simplicity
of
the
vulgar
was
anciently
assailed
by
the
donatists
who
abounded
in
miracles
we
therefore
give
the
same
answer
now
to
our
adversaries
as
augustine
gave
to
the
donatists
that
our
lord
hath
cautioned
us
against
these
by
his
prediction
that
there
should
arise
false
prophets
who
by
various
signs
and
lying
wonders
should
deceive
if
possible
the
very
and
paul
has
told
us
that
the
kingdom
of
antichrist
would
be
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
but
these
miracles
they
say
are
wrought
not
by
idols
or
sorcerers
or
false
prophets
but
by
saints
as
if
we
were
ignorant
that
it
is
a
stratagem
of
satan
to
transform
himself
into
an
angel
of
at
the
tomb
of
jeremiah
who
was
buried
in
egypt
the
egyptians
formerly
offered
sacrifices
and
other
divine
honours
was
not
this
abusing
god
s
holy
prophet
to
the
purposes
of
idolatry
yet
they
supposed
this
veneration
of
his
sepulchre
to
be
rewarded
with
a
cure
for
the
bite
of
serpents
what
shall
we
say
but
that
it
has
been
and
ever
will
be
the
most
righteous
vengeance
of
god
to
send
those
who
receive
not
the
love
of
the
truth
strong
delusions
that
they
should
believe
a
lie
we
are
by
no
means
without
miracles
and
such
as
are
certain
and
not
liable
to
cavils
but
those
under
which
they
shelter
themselves
are
mere
illusions
of
satan
seducing
the
people
from
the
true
worship
of
god
to
vanity
another
calumny
is
their
charging
us
with
opposition
to
the
fathers
mean
the
writers
of
the
earlier
and
purer
ages
if
those
writers
were
abettors
of
their
impiety
whereas
if
the
contest
were
to
be
terminated
by
this
authority
the
victory
in
most
parts
of
the
speak
in
the
most
modest
be
on
our
side
but
though
the
writings
of
those
fathers
contain
many
wise
and
excellent
things
yet
in
some
respects
they
have
suffered
the
common
fate
of
mankind
these
very
dutiful
children
reverence
only
their
errors
and
mistakes
but
their
excellences
they
either
overlook
or
conceal
or
corrupt
so
that
it
may
be
truly
said
to
be
their
only
study
to
collect
dross
from
the
midst
of
gold
then
they
overwhelm
us
with
senseless
clamours
as
despisers
and
enemies
of
the
fathers
but
we
do
not
hold
them
in
such
contempt
but
that
if
it
were
consistent
with
my
present
design
i
could
easily
support
by
their
suffrages
most
of
the
sentiments
that
we
now
maintain
but
while
we
make
use
of
their
writings
we
always
remember
that
all
things
are
ours
to
serve
us
not
to
have
dominion
over
us
and
that
we
are
christ
s
alone
and
owe
him
universal
obedience
he
who
neglects
this
distinction
will
have
nothing
decided
in
religion
since
those
holy
men
were
ignorant
of
many
things
frequently
at
variance
with
each
other
and
sometimes
even
inconsistent
with
themselves
there
is
great
reason
they
say
for
the
admonition
of
solomon
not
to
transgress
or
remove
the
ancient
landmarks
which
our
fathers
have
but
the
same
rule
is
not
applicable
to
the
bounding
of
fields
and
to
the
obedience
of
faith
which
ought
to
be
ready
to
forget
her
own
people
and
her
father
s
but
if
they
are
so
fond
of
allegorizing
why
do
they
not
explain
the
apostles
rather
than
any
others
to
be
those
fathers
whose
appointed
landmarks
it
is
so
unlawful
to
remove
for
this
is
the
interpretation
of
jerome
whose
works
they
have
received
into
their
canons
but
if
they
insist
on
preserving
the
landmarks
of
those
whom
they
understand
to
be
intended
why
do
they
at
pleasure
so
freely
transgress
them
themselves
there
were
two
fathers
of
whom
one
said
that
our
god
neither
eats
nor
drinks
and
therefore
needs
neither
cups
nor
dishes
the
other
that
sacred
things
require
no
gold
and
that
gold
is
no
recommendation
of
that
which
is
not
purchased
with
gold
this
landmark
therefore
is
transgressed
by
those
who
in
sacred
things
are
so
much
delighted
with
gold
silver
ivory
marble
jewels
and
silks
and
suppose
that
god
is
not
rightly
worshipped
unless
all
things
abound
in
exquisite
splendour
or
rather
extravagant
profusion
there
was
a
father
who
said
he
freely
partook
of
flesh
on
a
day
when
others
abstained
from
it
because
he
was
a
christian
they
transgress
the
landmarks
therefore
when
they
curse
the
soul
that
tastes
flesh
in
lent
there
were
two
fathers
of
whom
one
said
that
a
monk
who
labours
not
with
his
hands
is
on
a
level
with
a
cheat
or
a
robber
and
the
other
that
it
is
unlawful
for
monks
to
live
on
what
is
not
their
own
notwithstanding
their
assiduity
in
contemplations
studies
and
prayers
and
they
have
transgressed
this
landmark
by
placing
the
idle
and
distended
carcasses
of
monks
in
cells
and
brothels
to
be
pampered
on
the
substance
of
others
there
was
a
father
who
said
that
to
see
a
painted
image
of
christ
or
of
any
saint
in
the
temples
of
christians
is
a
dreadful
abomination
nor
was
this
merely
the
sentence
of
an
individual
it
was
also
decreed
by
an
ecclesiastical
council
that
the
object
of
worship
should
not
be
painted
on
the
walls
they
are
far
from
confining
themselves
within
these
landmarks
for
every
corner
is
filled
with
images
another
father
has
advised
that
after
having
discharged
the
office
of
humanity
towards
the
dead
by
the
rites
of
sepulture
we
should
leave
them
to
their
repose
they
break
through
these
landmarks
by
inculcating
a
constant
solicitude
for
the
dead
there
was
one
of
the
fathers
who
asserted
that
the
substance
of
bread
and
wine
in
the
eucharist
ceases
not
but
remains
just
as
the
substance
of
the
human
nature
remains
in
the
lord
christ
united
with
the
divine
they
transgress
this
landmark
therefore
by
pretending
that
on
the
words
of
the
lord
being
recited
the
substance
of
bread
and
wine
ceases
and
is
transubstantiated
into
his
body
and
blood
there
were
fathers
who
while
they
exhibited
to
the
universal
church
only
one
eucharist
and
forbade
all
scandalous
and
immoral
persons
to
approach
it
at
the
same
time
severely
censured
all
who
when
present
did
not
partake
of
it
how
far
have
they
removed
these
landmarks
when
they
fill
not
only
the
churches
but
even
private
houses
with
their
masses
admit
all
who
choose
to
be
spectators
of
them
and
every
one
the
more
readily
in
proportion
to
the
magnitude
of
his
contribution
however
chargeable
with
impurity
and
wickedness
they
invite
none
to
faith
in
christ
and
a
faithful
participation
of
the
sacraments
but
rather
for
purposes
of
gain
bring
forward
their
own
work
instead
of
the
grace
and
merit
of
christ
there
were
two
fathers
of
whom
one
contended
that
the
use
of
christ
s
sacred
supper
should
be
wholly
forbidden
to
those
who
content
with
partaking
of
one
kind
abstained
from
the
other
the
other
strenuously
maintained
that
christian
people
ought
not
to
be
refused
the
blood
of
their
lord
for
the
confession
of
whom
they
are
required
to
shed
their
own
these
landmarks
also
they
have
removed
in
appointing
by
an
inviolable
law
that
very
thing
which
the
former
punished
with
excommunication
and
the
latter
gave
a
powerful
reason
for
disapproving
there
was
a
father
who
asserted
the
temerity
of
deciding
on
either
side
of
an
obscure
subject
without
clear
and
evident
testimonies
of
scripture
this
landmark
they
forgot
when
they
made
so
many
constitutions
canons
and
judicial
determinations
without
any
authority
from
the
word
of
god
there
was
a
father
who
upbraided
montanus
with
having
among
other
heresies
been
the
first
imposer
of
laws
for
the
observance
of
fasts
they
have
gone
far
beyond
this
landmark
also
in
establishing
fasts
by
the
strictest
laws
there
was
a
father
who
denied
that
marriage
ought
to
be
forbidden
to
the
ministers
of
the
church
and
pronounced
cohabitation
with
a
wife
to
be
real
chastity
and
there
were
fathers
who
assented
to
his
judgment
they
have
transgressed
these
landmarks
by
enjoining
on
their
priests
the
strictest
celibacy
there
was
a
father
who
thought
that
attention
should
be
paid
to
christ
only
of
whom
it
is
said
hear
ye
him
and
that
no
regard
should
be
had
to
what
others
before
us
have
either
said
or
done
only
to
what
has
been
commanded
by
christ
who
is
preëminent
over
all
this
landmark
they
neither
prescribe
to
themselves
nor
permit
to
be
observed
by
others
when
they
set
up
over
themselves
and
others
any
masters
rather
than
christ
there
was
a
father
who
contended
that
the
church
ought
not
to
take
the
precedence
of
christ
because
his
judgment
is
always
according
to
truth
but
ecclesiastical
judges
like
other
men
may
generally
be
deceived
breaking
down
this
landmark
also
they
scruple
not
to
assert
that
all
the
authority
of
the
scripture
depends
on
the
decision
of
the
church
all
the
fathers
with
one
heart
and
voice
have
declared
it
execrable
and
detestable
for
the
holy
word
of
god
to
be
contaminated
with
the
subtleties
of
sophists
and
perplexed
by
the
wrangles
of
logicians
do
they
confine
themselves
within
these
landmarks
when
the
whole
business
of
their
lives
is
to
involve
the
simplicity
of
the
scripture
in
endless
controversies
and
worse
than
sophistical
wrangles
so
that
if
the
fathers
were
now
restored
to
life
and
heard
this
art
of
wrangling
which
they
call
speculative
divinity
they
would
not
suspect
the
dispute
to
have
the
least
reference
to
god
but
if
i
would
enumerate
all
the
instances
in
which
the
authority
of
the
fathers
is
insolently
rejected
by
those
who
would
be
thought
their
dutiful
children
my
address
would
exceed
all
reasonable
bounds
months
and
years
would
be
insufficient
for
me
and
yet
such
is
their
consummate
and
incorrigible
impudence
they
dare
to
censure
us
for
presuming
to
transgress
the
ancient
landmarks
nor
can
they
gain
any
advantage
against
us
by
their
argument
from
custom
for
if
we
were
compelled
to
submit
to
custom
we
should
have
to
complain
of
the
greatest
injustice
indeed
if
the
judgments
of
men
were
correct
custom
should
be
sought
among
the
good
but
the
fact
is
often
very
different
what
appears
to
be
practised
by
many
soon
obtains
the
force
of
a
custom
and
human
affairs
have
scarcely
ever
been
in
so
good
a
state
as
for
the
majority
to
be
pleased
with
things
of
real
excellence
from
the
private
vices
of
multitudes
therefore
has
arisen
public
error
or
rather
a
common
agreement
of
vices
which
these
good
men
would
now
have
to
be
received
as
law
it
is
evident
to
all
who
can
see
that
the
world
is
inundated
with
more
than
an
ocean
of
evils
that
it
is
overrun
with
numerous
destructive
pests
that
every
thing
is
fast
verging
to
ruin
so
that
we
must
altogether
despair
of
human
affairs
or
vigorously
and
even
violently
oppose
such
immense
evils
and
the
remedy
is
rejected
for
no
other
reason
but
because
we
have
been
accustomed
to
the
evils
so
long
but
let
public
error
be
tolerated
in
human
society
in
the
kingdom
of
god
nothing
but
his
eternal
truth
should
be
heard
and
regarded
which
no
succession
of
years
no
custom
no
confederacy
can
circumscribe
thus
isaiah
once
taught
the
chosen
people
of
god
say
ye
not
a
confederacy
to
all
to
whom
this
people
shall
say
a
confederacy
that
is
that
they
should
not
unite
in
the
wicked
consent
of
the
people
nor
fear
their
fear
nor
be
afraid
but
rather
sanctify
the
lord
of
hosts
that
he
might
be
their
fear
and
their
now
therefore
let
them
if
they
please
object
against
us
past
ages
and
present
examples
if
we
sanctify
the
lord
of
hosts
we
shall
not
be
much
afraid
for
whether
many
ages
agree
in
similar
impiety
he
is
mighty
to
take
vengeance
on
the
third
and
fourth
generation
or
whether
the
whole
world
combine
in
the
same
iniquity
he
has
given
an
example
of
the
fatal
end
of
those
who
sin
with
a
multitude
by
destroying
all
men
with
a
deluge
and
preserving
noah
and
his
small
family
in
order
that
his
individual
faith
might
condemn
the
whole
world
lastly
a
corrupt
custom
is
nothing
but
an
epidemical
pestilence
which
is
equally
fatal
to
its
objects
though
they
fall
with
a
multitude
besides
they
ought
to
consider
a
remark
somewhere
made
by
cyprian
that
persons
who
sin
through
ignorance
though
they
can
not
be
wholly
exculpated
may
yet
be
considered
in
some
degree
excusable
but
those
who
obstinately
reject
the
truth
offered
by
the
divine
goodness
are
without
any
excuse
at
all
nor
are
we
so
embarrassed
by
their
dilemma
as
to
be
obliged
to
confess
either
that
the
church
was
for
some
time
extinct
or
that
we
have
now
a
controversy
with
the
church
the
church
of
christ
has
lived
and
will
continue
to
live
as
long
as
christ
shall
reign
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
by
whose
hand
she
is
sustained
by
whose
protection
she
is
defended
by
whose
power
she
is
preserved
in
safety
for
he
will
undoubtedly
perform
what
he
once
promised
to
be
with
his
people
even
to
the
end
of
the
we
have
no
quarrel
against
the
church
for
with
one
consent
we
unite
with
all
the
company
of
the
faithful
in
worshipping
and
adoring
the
one
god
and
christ
the
lord
as
he
has
been
adored
by
all
the
pious
in
all
ages
but
our
opponents
deviate
widely
from
the
truth
when
they
acknowledge
no
church
but
what
is
visible
to
the
corporeal
eye
and
endeavour
to
circumscribe
it
by
those
limits
within
which
it
is
far
from
being
included
our
controversy
turns
on
the
two
following
points
they
contend
that
the
form
of
the
church
is
always
apparent
and
visible
secondly
they
place
that
form
in
the
see
of
the
roman
church
and
her
order
of
prelates
we
assert
on
the
contrary
first
that
the
church
may
exist
without
any
visible
form
secondly
that
its
form
is
not
contained
in
that
external
splendour
which
they
foolishly
admire
but
is
distinguished
by
a
very
different
criterion
viz
the
pure
preaching
of
god
s
word
and
the
legitimate
administration
of
the
sacraments
they
are
not
satisfied
unless
the
church
can
always
be
pointed
out
with
the
finger
but
how
often
among
the
jewish
people
was
it
so
disorganized
as
to
have
no
visible
form
left
what
splendid
form
do
we
suppose
could
be
seen
when
elias
deplored
his
being
left
alone
how
long
after
the
coming
of
christ
did
it
remain
without
any
external
form
how
often
since
that
time
have
wars
seditions
and
heresies
oppressed
and
totally
obscured
it
if
they
had
lived
at
that
period
would
they
have
believed
that
any
church
existed
yet
elias
was
informed
that
there
were
left
seven
thousand
who
had
not
bowed
the
knee
to
nor
should
we
entertain
any
doubt
of
christ
s
having
always
reigned
on
earth
ever
since
his
ascension
to
heaven
but
if
the
pious
at
such
periods
had
sought
for
any
form
evident
to
their
senses
must
not
their
hearts
have
been
quite
discouraged
indeed
it
was
already
considered
by
hilary
in
his
day
as
a
grievous
error
that
people
were
absorbed
in
foolish
admiration
of
the
episcopal
dignity
and
did
not
perceive
the
dreadful
mischiefs
concealed
under
that
disguise
for
this
is
his
language
one
thing
i
advise
of
antichrist
for
you
have
an
improper
attachment
to
walls
your
veneration
for
the
church
of
god
is
misplaced
on
houses
and
buildings
you
wrongly
introduce
under
them
the
name
of
peace
is
there
any
doubt
that
they
will
be
seats
of
antichrist
i
think
mountains
woods
and
lakes
prisons
and
whirlpools
less
dangerous
for
these
were
the
scenes
of
retirement
or
banishment
in
which
the
prophets
but
what
excites
the
veneration
of
the
multitude
in
the
present
day
for
their
horned
bishops
but
the
supposition
that
those
are
the
holy
prelates
of
religion
whom
they
see
presiding
over
great
cities
away
then
with
such
stupid
admiration
let
us
rather
leave
it
to
the
lord
since
he
alone
knoweth
them
that
are
his
sometimes
to
remove
from
human
observation
all
external
knowledge
of
his
church
i
admit
this
to
be
a
dreadful
judgment
of
god
on
the
earth
but
if
it
be
deserved
by
the
impiety
of
men
why
do
we
attempt
to
resist
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
thus
the
lord
punished
the
ingratitude
of
men
in
former
ages
for
in
consequence
of
their
resistance
to
his
truth
and
extinction
of
the
light
he
had
given
them
he
permitted
them
to
be
blinded
by
sense
deluded
by
absurd
falsehoods
and
immerged
in
profound
darkness
so
that
there
was
no
appearance
of
the
true
church
left
yet
at
the
same
time
in
the
midst
of
darkness
and
errors
he
preserved
his
scattered
and
concealed
people
from
total
destruction
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
he
knew
how
to
save
in
all
the
confusion
of
babylon
and
the
flame
of
the
fiery
furnace
but
how
dangerous
it
is
to
estimate
the
form
of
the
church
by
i
know
not
what
vain
pomp
which
they
contend
for
i
shall
rather
briefly
suggest
than
state
at
large
lest
i
should
protract
this
discourse
to
an
excessive
length
the
pope
they
say
who
holds
the
apostolic
see
and
the
bishops
anointed
and
consecrated
by
him
provided
they
are
equipped
with
mitres
and
crosiers
represent
the
church
and
ought
to
be
considered
as
the
church
therefore
they
can
not
err
how
is
this
they
are
pastors
of
the
church
and
consecrated
to
the
lord
and
did
not
the
pastoral
character
belong
to
aaron
and
the
other
rulers
of
israel
yet
aaron
and
his
sons
after
their
designation
to
the
priesthood
fell
into
error
when
they
made
the
golden
calf
according
to
this
mode
of
reasoning
why
should
not
the
four
hundred
prophets
who
lied
to
ahab
have
represented
the
church
but
the
church
remained
on
the
side
of
micaiah
solitary
and
despised
as
he
was
and
out
of
his
mouth
proceeded
the
truth
did
not
those
prophets
exhibit
both
the
name
and
appearance
of
the
church
who
with
united
violence
rose
up
against
jeremiah
and
threatened
and
boasted
the
law
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest
nor
counsel
from
the
wise
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet
jeremiah
is
sent
singly
against
the
whole
multitude
of
prophets
with
a
denunciation
from
the
lord
that
the
law
shall
perish
from
the
priest
counsel
from
the
wise
and
the
word
from
the
and
was
there
not
the
like
external
respectability
in
the
council
convened
by
the
chief
priests
scribes
and
pharisees
to
consult
about
putting
christ
to
death
now
let
them
go
and
adhere
to
the
external
appearance
and
thereby
make
christ
and
all
the
prophets
schismatics
and
on
the
other
hand
make
the
ministers
of
satan
instruments
of
the
holy
spirit
but
if
they
speak
their
real
sentiments
let
them
answer
me
sincerely
what
nation
or
place
they
consider
as
the
seat
of
the
church
from
the
time
when
by
a
decree
of
the
council
of
basil
eugenius
was
deposed
and
degraded
from
the
pontificate
and
amadeus
substituted
in
his
place
they
can
not
deny
that
the
council
as
far
as
relates
to
external
forms
was
a
lawful
one
and
summoned
not
only
by
one
pope
but
by
two
there
eugenius
was
pronounced
guilty
of
schism
rebellion
and
obstinacy
together
with
all
the
host
of
cardinals
and
bishops
who
had
joined
him
in
attempting
a
dissolution
of
the
council
yet
afterwards
assisted
by
the
favour
of
princes
he
regained
the
quiet
possession
of
his
former
dignity
that
election
of
amadeus
though
formally
made
by
the
authority
of
a
general
and
holy
synod
vanished
into
smoke
and
he
was
appeased
with
a
cardinal
s
hat
like
a
barking
dog
with
a
morsel
from
the
bosom
of
those
heretics
and
rebels
have
proceeded
all
the
popes
cardinals
bishops
abbots
and
priests
ever
since
here
they
must
stop
for
to
which
party
will
they
give
the
title
of
the
church
will
they
deny
that
this
was
a
general
council
which
wanted
nothing
to
complete
its
external
majesty
being
solemnly
convened
by
two
papal
bulls
consecrated
by
a
presiding
legate
of
the
roman
see
and
well
regulated
in
every
point
of
order
and
invariably
preserving
the
same
dignity
to
the
last
will
they
acknowledge
eugenius
to
be
a
schismatic
with
all
his
adherents
by
whom
they
have
all
been
consecrated
either
therefore
let
them
give
a
different
definition
of
the
form
of
the
church
or
whatever
be
their
number
we
shall
account
them
all
schismatics
as
having
been
knowingly
and
voluntarily
ordained
by
heretics
but
if
it
had
never
been
ascertained
before
that
the
church
is
not
confined
to
external
pomps
they
would
themselves
afford
us
abundant
proof
of
it
who
have
so
long
superciliously
exhibited
themselves
to
the
world
under
the
title
of
the
church
though
they
were
at
the
same
time
the
deadly
plagues
of
it
i
speak
not
of
their
morals
and
those
tragical
exploits
with
which
all
their
lives
abound
since
they
profess
themselves
to
be
pharisees
who
are
to
be
heard
and
not
imitated
i
refer
to
the
very
doctrine
itself
on
which
they
found
their
claim
to
be
considered
as
the
church
if
you
devote
a
portion
of
your
leisure
sire
to
the
perusal
of
our
writings
you
will
clearly
discover
that
doctrine
to
be
a
fatal
pestilence
of
souls
the
firebrand
ruin
and
destruction
of
the
church
finally
they
betray
great
want
of
candour
by
invidiously
repeating
what
great
commotions
tumults
and
contentions
have
attended
the
preaching
of
our
doctrine
and
what
effects
it
produces
in
many
persons
for
it
is
unfair
to
charge
it
with
those
evils
which
ought
to
be
attributed
to
the
malice
of
satan
it
is
the
native
property
of
the
divine
word
never
to
make
its
appearance
without
disturbing
satan
and
rousing
his
opposition
this
is
the
most
certain
and
unequivocal
criterion
by
which
it
is
distinguished
from
false
doctrines
which
are
easily
broached
when
they
are
heard
with
general
attention
and
received
with
applauses
by
the
world
thus
in
some
ages
when
all
things
were
immerged
in
profound
darkness
the
prince
of
this
world
amused
and
diverted
himself
with
the
generality
of
mankind
and
like
another
sardanapalus
gave
himself
up
to
his
ease
and
pleasures
in
perfect
peace
for
what
would
he
do
but
amuse
and
divert
himself
in
the
quiet
and
undisturbed
possession
of
his
kingdom
but
when
the
light
shining
from
above
dissipated
a
portion
of
his
that
mighty
one
alarmed
and
assaulted
his
he
began
to
shake
off
his
wonted
torpor
and
to
hurry
on
his
armour
first
indeed
he
stirred
up
the
power
of
men
to
suppress
the
truth
by
violence
at
its
first
appearance
and
when
this
proved
ineffectual
he
had
recourse
to
subtlety
he
made
the
catabaptists
and
other
infamous
characters
the
instruments
of
exciting
dissensions
and
doctrinal
controversies
with
a
view
to
obscure
and
finally
to
extinguish
it
and
now
he
continues
to
attack
it
in
both
ways
for
he
endeavours
to
root
up
this
genuine
seed
by
means
of
human
force
and
at
the
same
time
tries
every
effort
to
choke
it
with
his
tares
that
it
may
not
grow
and
produce
fruit
but
all
his
attempts
will
be
vain
if
we
attend
to
the
admonitions
of
the
lord
who
hath
long
ago
made
us
acquainted
with
his
devices
that
we
might
not
be
caught
by
him
unawares
and
has
armed
us
with
sufficient
means
of
defence
against
all
his
assaults
but
to
charge
the
word
of
god
with
the
odium
of
seditions
excited
against
it
by
wicked
and
rebellious
men
or
of
sects
raised
by
impostors
not
this
extreme
malignity
yet
it
is
not
without
example
in
former
times
elias
was
asked
whether
it
was
not
he
that
troubled
christ
was
represented
by
the
jews
as
guilty
of
sedition
the
apostles
were
accused
of
stirring
up
popular
commotions
wherein
does
this
differ
from
the
conduct
of
those
who
at
the
present
day
impute
to
us
all
the
disturbances
tumults
and
contentions
that
break
out
against
us
but
the
proper
answer
to
such
accusations
has
been
taught
us
by
elias
that
the
dissemination
of
errors
and
the
raising
of
tumults
is
not
chargeable
on
us
but
on
those
who
are
resisting
the
power
of
god
but
as
this
one
reply
is
sufficient
to
repress
their
temerity
so
on
the
other
hand
we
must
meet
the
weakness
of
some
persons
who
are
frequently
disturbed
with
such
offences
and
become
unsettled
and
wavering
in
their
minds
now
that
they
may
not
stumble
and
fall
amidst
this
agitation
and
perplexity
let
them
know
that
the
apostles
in
their
day
experienced
the
same
things
that
now
befall
us
there
were
unlearned
and
unstable
men
peter
says
who
wrested
the
inspired
writings
of
paul
to
their
own
there
were
despisers
of
god
who
when
they
heard
that
where
sin
abounded
grace
did
much
more
abound
immediately
concluded
let
us
continue
in
sin
that
grace
may
when
they
heard
that
the
faithful
were
not
under
the
law
they
immediately
croaked
we
will
sin
because
we
are
not
under
the
law
but
under
there
were
some
who
accused
him
as
an
encourager
of
sin
many
false
apostles
crept
in
to
destroy
the
churches
he
had
raised
some
preached
the
gospel
of
envy
and
strife
not
in
sincerity
maliciously
supposing
to
add
affliction
to
his
in
some
places
the
gospel
was
attended
with
little
benefit
all
were
seeking
their
own
not
the
things
of
jesus
others
returned
like
dogs
to
their
vomit
and
like
swine
to
their
wallowing
in
the
many
perverted
the
liberty
of
the
spirit
into
the
licentiousness
of
the
flesh
many
insinuated
themselves
as
brethren
who
afterwards
brought
the
pious
into
dangers
various
contentions
were
excited
among
the
brethren
themselves
what
was
to
be
done
by
the
apostles
in
such
circumstances
should
they
not
have
dissembled
for
a
time
or
rather
have
rejected
and
deserted
that
gospel
which
appeared
to
be
the
nursery
of
so
many
disputes
the
cause
of
so
many
dangers
the
occasion
of
so
many
offences
but
in
such
difficulties
as
these
their
minds
were
relieved
by
this
reflection
that
christ
is
the
stone
of
stumbling
and
rock
of
offence
set
for
the
fall
and
rising
again
of
many
and
for
a
sign
which
shall
be
spoken
against
and
armed
with
this
confidence
they
proceeded
boldly
through
all
the
dangers
of
tumults
and
offences
the
same
consideration
should
support
us
since
paul
declares
it
to
be
the
perpetual
character
of
the
gospel
that
it
is
a
savour
of
death
unto
death
in
them
that
perish
although
it
was
rather
given
us
to
be
the
savour
of
life
unto
life
and
the
power
of
god
to
the
salvation
of
the
faithful
which
we
also
should
certainly
experience
it
to
be
if
we
did
not
corrupt
this
eminent
gift
of
god
by
our
ingratitude
and
pervert
to
our
destruction
what
ought
to
be
a
principal
instrument
of
our
salvation
but
i
return
to
you
sire
let
not
your
majesty
be
at
all
moved
by
those
groundless
accusations
with
which
our
adversaries
endeavour
to
terrify
you
as
that
the
sole
tendency
and
design
of
this
new
so
they
call
to
furnish
a
pretext
for
seditions
and
to
gain
impunity
for
all
crimes
for
god
is
not
the
author
of
confusion
but
of
peace
nor
is
the
son
of
god
who
came
to
destroy
the
works
of
the
devil
the
minister
of
and
it
is
unjust
to
charge
us
with
such
motives
and
designs
of
which
we
have
never
given
cause
for
the
least
suspicion
is
it
probable
that
we
are
meditating
the
subversion
of
kingdoms
who
were
never
heard
to
utter
a
factious
word
whose
lives
were
ever
known
to
be
peaceable
and
honest
while
we
lived
under
your
government
and
who
even
now
in
our
exile
cease
not
to
pray
for
all
prosperity
to
attend
yourself
and
your
kingdom
is
it
probable
that
we
are
seeking
an
unlimited
license
to
commit
crimes
with
impunity
in
whose
conduct
though
many
things
may
be
blamed
yet
there
is
nothing
worthy
of
such
severe
reproach
nor
have
we
by
divine
grace
profited
so
little
in
the
gospel
but
that
our
life
may
be
an
example
to
our
detractors
of
chastity
liberality
mercy
temperance
patience
modesty
and
every
other
virtue
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
we
sincerely
fear
and
worship
god
whose
name
we
desire
to
be
sanctified
both
by
our
life
and
by
our
death
and
envy
itself
is
constrained
to
bear
testimony
to
the
innocence
and
civil
integrity
of
some
of
us
who
have
suffered
the
punishment
of
death
for
that
very
thing
which
ought
to
be
accounted
their
highest
praise
but
if
the
gospel
be
made
a
pretext
for
tumults
which
has
not
yet
happened
in
your
kingdom
if
any
persons
make
the
liberty
of
divine
grace
an
excuse
for
the
licentiousness
of
their
vices
of
whom
i
have
known
many
are
laws
and
legal
penalties
by
which
they
may
be
punished
according
to
their
deserts
only
let
not
the
gospel
of
god
be
reproached
for
the
crimes
of
wicked
men
you
have
now
sire
the
virulent
iniquity
of
our
calumniators
laid
before
you
in
a
sufficient
number
of
instances
that
you
may
not
receive
their
accusations
with
too
credulous
an
fear
i
have
gone
too
much
into
the
detail
as
this
preface
already
approaches
the
size
of
a
full
apology
whereas
i
intended
it
not
to
contain
our
defence
but
only
to
prepare
your
mind
to
attend
to
the
pleading
of
our
cause
for
though
you
are
now
averse
and
alienated
from
us
and
even
inflamed
against
us
we
despair
not
of
regaining
your
favour
if
you
will
only
once
read
with
calmness
and
composure
this
our
confession
which
we
intend
as
our
defence
before
your
majesty
but
on
the
contrary
if
your
ears
are
so
preoccupied
with
the
whispers
of
the
malevolent
as
to
leave
no
opportunity
for
the
accused
to
speak
for
themselves
and
if
those
outrageous
furies
with
your
connivance
continue
to
persecute
with
imprisonments
scourges
tortures
confiscations
and
flames
we
shall
indeed
like
sheep
destined
to
the
slaughter
be
reduced
to
the
greatest
extremities
yet
shall
we
in
patience
possess
our
souls
and
wait
for
the
mighty
hand
of
the
lord
which
undoubtedly
will
in
time
appear
and
show
itself
armed
for
the
deliverance
of
the
poor
from
their
affliction
and
for
the
punishment
of
their
despisers
who
now
exult
in
such
perfect
security
may
the
lord
the
king
of
kings
establish
your
throne
with
righteousness
and
your
kingdom
with
equity
basil
august
general
syllabus
the
design
of
the
author
in
these
christian
institutes
is
twofold
relating
first
to
the
knowledge
of
god
as
the
way
to
attain
a
blessed
immortality
and
in
connection
with
and
subservience
to
this
secondly
to
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
in
the
prosecution
of
this
design
he
strictly
follows
the
method
of
the
apostles
creed
as
being
most
familiar
to
all
christians
for
as
the
creed
consists
of
four
parts
the
first
relating
to
god
the
father
the
second
to
the
son
the
third
to
the
holy
spirit
the
fourth
to
the
church
so
the
author
distributes
the
whole
of
this
work
into
four
books
corresponding
respectively
to
the
four
parts
of
the
creed
as
will
clearly
appear
from
the
following
detail
i
the
first
article
of
the
creed
relates
to
god
the
father
and
to
the
creation
conservation
and
government
of
all
things
which
are
included
in
his
omnipotence
so
the
first
book
is
on
the
knowledge
of
god
considered
as
the
creator
preserver
and
governor
of
the
universe
at
large
and
of
every
thing
contained
in
it
it
shows
both
the
nature
and
tendency
of
the
true
knowledge
of
the
this
is
not
learned
in
the
schools
but
that
every
man
from
his
birth
is
that
the
depravity
of
men
is
so
great
as
to
corrupt
and
extinguish
this
knowledge
partly
by
ignorance
partly
by
wickedness
so
that
it
neither
leads
him
to
glorify
god
as
he
ought
nor
conducts
him
to
the
attainment
of
though
this
internal
knowledge
is
assisted
by
all
the
creatures
around
which
serve
as
a
mirror
to
display
the
divine
perfections
yet
that
man
does
not
profit
by
that
to
those
whom
it
is
god
s
will
to
bring
to
an
intimate
and
saving
knowledge
of
himself
he
gives
his
written
word
which
introduces
observations
on
the
sacred
he
has
therein
revealed
himself
that
not
the
father
only
but
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
united
is
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
whom
neither
the
knowledge
innate
by
nature
nor
the
very
beautiful
mirror
displayed
to
us
in
the
world
can
in
consequence
of
our
depravity
teach
us
to
know
so
as
to
glorify
him
this
gives
occasion
for
treating
of
the
revelation
of
god
in
the
scripture
of
the
unity
of
the
divine
essence
and
the
trinity
of
prevent
man
from
attributing
to
god
the
blame
of
his
own
voluntary
blindness
the
author
shows
the
state
of
man
at
his
creation
and
treats
of
the
image
of
god
and
the
primitive
integrity
of
finished
the
subject
of
creation
he
proceeds
to
the
conservation
and
government
of
all
things
concluding
the
first
book
with
a
full
discussion
of
the
doctrine
of
divine
providence
ii
but
since
man
is
fallen
by
sin
from
the
state
in
which
he
was
created
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
christ
therefore
it
follows
in
the
creed
and
in
jesus
christ
his
only
son
our
lord
so
in
the
second
book
of
the
institutes
our
author
treats
of
the
knowledge
of
god
as
the
redeemer
in
christ
and
having
shown
the
fall
of
man
leads
him
to
christ
the
mediator
here
he
states
the
doctrine
of
original
man
possesses
no
inherent
strength
to
enable
him
to
deliver
himself
from
sin
and
the
impending
curse
but
that
on
the
contrary
nothing
can
proceed
from
him
antecedently
to
reconciliation
and
renovation
but
what
is
deserving
of
that
man
being
utterly
lost
in
himself
and
incapable
of
conceiving
even
a
good
thought
by
which
he
may
restore
himself
or
perform
actions
acceptable
to
god
he
must
seek
redemption
out
of
himself
in
the
law
was
given
for
this
purpose
not
to
confine
its
observers
to
itself
but
to
conduct
them
to
christ
which
gives
occasion
to
introduce
an
exposition
of
the
moral
he
was
known
as
the
author
of
salvation
to
the
jews
under
the
law
but
more
fully
under
the
gospel
in
which
he
is
manifested
to
the
follows
the
doctrine
of
the
similarity
and
difference
of
the
old
and
new
testament
of
the
law
and
is
next
stated
that
in
order
to
the
complete
accomplishment
of
salvation
it
was
necessary
for
the
eternal
son
of
god
to
become
man
and
that
he
actually
assumed
a
real
human
nature
is
also
shown
how
these
two
natures
constitute
one
the
office
of
christ
appointed
for
the
acquisition
and
application
of
complete
salvation
by
his
merit
and
efficacy
is
sacerdotal
regal
and
follows
the
manner
in
which
christ
executed
his
office
or
actually
performed
the
part
of
a
mediator
being
an
exposition
of
the
articles
respecting
his
death
resurrection
and
ascension
to
the
author
shows
the
truth
and
propriety
of
affirming
that
christ
merited
the
grace
of
god
and
salvation
for
us
iii
as
long
as
christ
is
separate
from
us
he
profits
us
nothing
hence
the
necessity
of
our
being
ingrafted
into
him
as
branches
into
a
vine
therefore
the
doctrine
concerning
christ
is
followed
in
the
third
part
of
the
creed
by
this
clause
i
believe
in
the
holy
spirit
as
being
the
bond
of
union
between
us
and
christ
so
in
the
third
book
our
author
treats
of
the
holy
spirit
who
unites
us
to
consequently
of
faith
by
which
we
embrace
christ
with
his
twofold
benefit
free
righteousness
which
he
imputes
to
us
and
regeneration
which
he
commences
within
us
by
bestowing
repentance
upon
to
show
that
we
have
not
the
least
room
to
glory
in
such
faith
as
is
unconnected
with
the
pursuit
of
repentance
before
proceeding
to
the
full
discussion
of
justification
he
treats
at
large
of
repentance
and
the
continual
exercise
of
it
which
christ
apprehended
by
faith
produces
in
us
by
his
next
fully
discusses
the
first
and
chief
benefit
of
christ
when
united
to
us
by
the
holy
spirit
that
is
then
treats
of
prayer
which
resembles
the
hand
that
actually
receives
those
blessings
to
be
enjoyed
which
faith
knows
from
the
word
of
promise
to
be
laid
up
with
god
for
our
as
all
men
are
not
united
to
christ
the
sole
author
of
salvation
by
the
holy
spirit
who
creates
and
preserves
faith
in
us
he
treats
of
god
s
eternal
election
which
is
the
cause
that
we
in
whom
he
foresaw
no
good
but
what
he
intended
freely
to
bestow
have
been
favoured
with
the
gift
of
christ
and
united
to
god
by
the
effectual
call
of
the
he
treats
of
complete
regeneration
and
the
fruition
of
happiness
that
is
the
final
resurrection
towards
which
our
eyes
must
be
directed
since
in
this
world
the
felicity
of
the
pious
in
respect
of
enjoyment
is
only
begun
iv
but
as
the
holy
spirit
does
not
unite
all
men
to
christ
or
make
them
partakers
of
faith
and
on
those
to
whom
he
imparts
it
he
does
not
ordinarily
bestow
it
without
means
but
employs
for
this
purpose
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
and
the
use
of
the
sacraments
with
the
administration
of
all
discipline
therefore
it
follows
in
the
creed
i
believe
in
the
holy
catholic
church
whom
though
involved
in
eternal
death
yet
in
pursuance
of
the
gratuitous
election
god
has
freely
reconciled
to
himself
in
christ
and
made
partakers
of
the
holy
spirit
that
being
ingrafted
into
christ
they
may
have
communion
with
him
as
their
head
whence
flows
a
perpetual
remission
of
sins
and
a
full
restoration
to
eternal
life
so
in
the
fourth
book
our
author
treats
of
the
of
the
means
used
by
the
holy
spirit
in
effectually
calling
from
spiritual
death
and
preserving
the
word
and
and
the
lord
s
are
as
it
were
christ
s
regal
sceptre
by
which
he
commences
his
spiritual
reign
in
the
church
by
the
energy
of
his
spirit
and
carries
it
forwards
from
day
to
day
during
the
present
life
after
the
close
of
which
he
perfects
it
without
those
means
and
as
political
institutions
are
the
asylums
of
the
church
in
this
life
though
civil
government
is
distinct
from
the
spiritual
kingdom
of
christ
our
author
instructs
us
respecting
it
as
a
signal
blessing
of
god
which
the
church
ought
to
acknowledge
with
gratitude
of
heart
till
we
are
called
out
of
this
transitory
state
to
the
heavenly
inheritance
where
god
will
be
all
in
all
this
is
the
plan
of
the
institutes
which
may
be
comprised
in
the
following
brief
summary
man
created
originally
upright
being
afterwards
ruined
not
partially
but
totally
finds
salvation
out
of
himself
wholly
in
christ
to
whom
being
united
by
the
holy
spirit
freely
bestowed
without
any
regard
of
future
works
he
enjoys
in
him
a
twofold
benefit
the
perfect
imputation
of
righteousness
which
attends
him
to
the
grave
and
the
commencement
of
sanctification
which
he
daily
increases
till
at
length
he
completes
it
at
the
day
of
regeneration
or
resurrection
of
the
body
so
that
in
eternal
life
and
the
heavenly
inheritance
his
praises
are
celebrated
for
such
stupendous
mercy
book
i
on
the
knowledge
of
god
the
creator
argument
the
first
book
treats
of
the
knowledge
of
god
the
creator
but
this
being
chiefly
manifested
in
the
creation
of
man
man
also
is
made
the
subject
of
discussion
thus
the
principal
topics
of
the
whole
treatise
are
knowledge
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
man
in
the
first
chapter
they
are
considered
together
in
the
following
chapters
separately
yet
some
things
are
introduced
which
may
be
referred
to
either
or
both
what
respects
the
scripture
and
images
may
belong
to
the
knowledge
of
god
what
respects
the
formation
of
the
world
the
holy
angels
and
the
devils
to
the
knowledge
of
man
and
what
respects
the
manner
in
which
god
governs
the
world
to
both
on
the
first
of
these
topics
the
knowledge
of
god
this
book
shows
first
what
kind
of
knowledge
god
himself
ii
secondly
where
it
must
be
as
follows
not
in
man
because
though
the
human
mind
is
naturally
endued
with
it
yet
it
is
extinguished
partly
by
ignorance
partly
by
iii
iv
nor
in
the
structure
of
the
world
because
though
it
shines
there
with
the
brightest
evidence
testimonies
of
that
kind
however
plain
are
through
our
stupidity
wholly
useless
to
but
in
the
thirdly
what
kind
of
a
being
god
fourthly
the
impiety
of
ascribing
to
god
a
visible
form
with
observations
on
the
adoration
and
origin
of
xi
fifthly
the
reasonableness
that
god
alone
should
be
supremely
xii
lastly
the
unity
of
the
divine
essence
and
the
distinction
of
three
xiii
on
the
other
of
these
topics
the
knowledge
of
man
it
contains
first
a
dissertation
on
the
creation
of
the
world
and
on
the
good
and
evil
angels
all
which
relate
to
xiv
secondly
proceeding
to
man
himself
an
examination
of
his
nature
and
xv
but
in
order
to
a
clearer
illustration
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
man
the
three
remaining
chapters
treat
of
the
government
of
all
human
actions
and
of
the
whole
world
in
opposition
to
fortune
and
fate
stating
the
pure
doctrine
and
showing
its
use
and
conclude
with
proving
that
though
god
uses
the
agency
of
the
wicked
he
is
pure
from
all
pollution
and
chargeable
with
no
blame
chapter
i
the
connection
between
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
true
and
substantial
wisdom
principally
consists
of
two
parts
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
but
while
these
two
branches
of
knowledge
are
so
intimately
connected
which
of
them
precedes
and
produces
the
other
is
not
easy
to
discover
for
in
the
first
place
no
man
can
take
a
survey
of
himself
but
he
must
immediately
turn
to
the
contemplation
of
god
in
whom
he
lives
and
moves
since
it
is
evident
that
the
talents
which
we
possess
are
not
from
ourselves
and
that
our
very
existence
is
nothing
but
a
subsistence
in
god
alone
these
bounties
distilling
to
us
by
drops
from
heaven
form
as
it
were
so
many
streams
conducting
us
to
the
our
poverty
conduces
to
a
clearer
display
of
the
infinite
fulness
of
god
especially
the
miserable
ruin
into
which
we
have
been
plunged
by
the
defection
of
the
first
man
compels
us
to
raise
our
eyes
towards
heaven
not
only
as
hungry
and
famished
to
seek
thence
a
supply
for
our
wants
but
aroused
with
fear
to
learn
humility
for
since
man
is
subject
to
a
world
of
miseries
and
has
been
spoiled
of
his
divine
array
this
melancholy
exposure
discovers
an
immense
mass
of
deformity
every
one
therefore
must
be
so
impressed
with
a
consciousness
of
his
own
infelicity
as
to
arrive
at
some
knowledge
of
god
thus
a
sense
of
our
ignorance
vanity
poverty
infirmity
depravity
and
corruption
leads
us
to
perceive
and
acknowledge
that
in
the
lord
alone
are
to
be
found
true
wisdom
solid
strength
perfect
goodness
and
unspotted
righteousness
and
so
by
our
imperfections
we
are
excited
to
a
consideration
of
the
perfections
of
god
nor
can
we
really
aspire
toward
him
till
we
have
begun
to
be
displeased
with
ourselves
for
who
would
not
gladly
rest
satisfied
with
himself
where
is
the
man
not
actually
absorbed
in
while
he
remains
unacquainted
with
his
true
situation
or
content
with
his
own
endowments
and
ignorant
or
forgetful
of
his
own
misery
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
therefore
is
not
only
an
incitement
to
seek
after
god
but
likewise
a
considerable
assistance
towards
finding
him
ii
on
the
other
hand
it
is
plain
that
no
man
can
arrive
at
the
true
knowledge
of
himself
without
having
first
contemplated
the
divine
character
and
then
descended
to
the
consideration
of
his
own
for
such
is
the
native
pride
of
us
all
we
invariably
esteem
ourselves
righteous
innocent
wise
and
holy
till
we
are
convinced
by
clear
proofs
of
our
unrighteousness
turpitude
folly
and
impurity
but
we
are
never
thus
convinced
while
we
confine
our
attention
to
ourselves
and
regard
not
the
lord
who
is
the
only
standard
by
which
this
judgment
ought
to
be
formed
because
from
our
natural
proneness
to
hypocrisy
any
vain
appearance
of
righteousness
abundantly
contents
us
instead
of
the
reality
and
every
thing
within
and
around
us
being
exceedingly
defiled
we
are
delighted
with
what
is
least
so
as
extremely
pure
while
we
confine
our
reflections
within
the
limits
of
human
corruption
so
the
eye
accustomed
to
see
nothing
but
black
judges
that
to
be
very
white
which
is
but
whitish
or
perhaps
brown
indeed
the
senses
of
our
bodies
may
assist
us
in
discovering
how
grossly
we
err
in
estimating
the
powers
of
the
soul
for
if
at
we
look
either
on
the
ground
or
at
any
surrounding
objects
we
conclude
our
vision
to
be
very
strong
and
piercing
but
when
we
raise
our
eyes
and
steadily
look
at
the
sun
they
are
at
once
dazzled
and
confounded
with
such
a
blaze
of
brightness
and
we
are
constrained
to
confess
that
our
sight
so
piercing
in
viewing
terrestrial
things
when
directed
to
the
sun
is
dimness
itself
thus
also
it
happens
in
the
consideration
of
our
spiritual
endowments
for
as
long
as
our
views
are
bounded
by
the
earth
perfectly
content
with
our
own
righteousness
wisdom
and
strength
we
fondly
flatter
ourselves
and
fancy
we
are
little
less
than
demigods
but
if
we
once
elevate
our
thoughts
to
god
and
consider
his
nature
and
the
consummate
perfection
of
his
righteousness
wisdom
and
strength
to
which
we
ought
to
be
conformed
before
charmed
us
in
ourselves
under
the
false
pretext
of
righteousness
will
soon
be
loathed
as
the
greatest
iniquity
what
strangely
deceived
us
under
the
title
of
wisdom
will
be
despised
as
extreme
folly
and
what
wore
the
appearance
of
strength
will
be
proved
to
be
most
wretched
impotence
so
very
remote
from
the
divine
purity
is
what
seems
in
us
the
highest
perfection
iii
hence
that
horror
and
amazement
with
which
the
scripture
always
represents
the
saints
to
have
been
impressed
and
disturbed
on
every
discovery
of
the
presence
of
god
for
when
we
see
those
who
before
his
appearance
stood
secure
and
firm
so
astonished
and
affrighted
at
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
as
to
faint
and
almost
expire
through
fear
must
infer
that
man
is
never
sufficiently
affected
with
a
knowledge
of
his
own
meanness
till
he
has
compared
himself
with
the
divine
majesty
of
this
consternation
we
have
frequent
examples
in
the
judges
and
prophets
so
that
it
was
a
common
expression
among
the
lord
s
we
shall
die
because
we
have
seen
therefore
the
history
of
job
to
humble
men
with
a
consciousness
of
their
pollution
impotence
and
folly
derives
its
principal
argument
from
a
description
of
the
divine
purity
power
and
wisdom
and
not
without
reason
for
we
see
how
abraham
the
nearer
he
approached
to
behold
the
glory
of
the
lord
the
more
fully
acknowledged
himself
to
be
but
dust
and
ashes
and
how
elias
could
not
bear
his
approach
without
covering
his
face
his
appearance
is
so
formidable
and
what
can
man
do
all
vile
and
corrupt
when
fear
constrains
even
the
cherubim
themselves
to
veil
their
faces
this
is
what
the
prophet
isaiah
speaks
the
moon
shall
be
confounded
and
the
sun
ashamed
when
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
reign
that
is
when
he
shall
make
a
fuller
and
nearer
exhibition
of
his
splendour
it
shall
eclipse
the
splendour
of
the
brightest
object
besides
but
though
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
be
intimately
connected
the
proper
order
of
instruction
requires
us
first
to
treat
of
the
former
and
then
to
proceed
to
the
discussion
of
the
latter
chapter
ii
the
nature
and
tendency
of
the
knowledge
of
god
by
the
knowledge
of
god
i
intend
not
merely
a
notion
that
there
is
such
a
being
but
also
an
acquaintance
with
whatever
we
ought
to
know
concerning
him
conducing
to
his
glory
and
our
benefit
for
we
can
not
with
propriety
say
there
is
any
knowledge
of
god
where
there
is
no
religion
or
piety
i
have
no
reference
here
to
that
species
of
knowledge
by
which
men
lost
and
condemned
in
themselves
apprehend
god
the
redeemer
in
christ
the
mediator
but
only
to
that
first
and
simple
knowledge
to
which
the
genuine
order
of
nature
would
lead
us
if
adam
had
retained
his
innocence
for
though
in
the
present
ruined
state
of
human
nature
no
man
will
ever
perceive
god
to
be
a
father
or
the
author
of
salvation
or
in
any
respect
propitious
but
as
pacified
by
the
mediation
of
christ
yet
it
is
one
thing
to
understand
that
god
our
maker
supports
us
by
his
power
governs
us
by
his
providence
nourishes
us
by
his
goodness
and
follows
us
with
blessings
of
every
kind
and
another
to
embrace
the
grace
of
reconciliation
proposed
to
us
in
christ
therefore
since
god
is
first
manifested
both
in
the
structure
of
the
world
and
in
the
general
tenor
of
scripture
simply
as
the
creator
and
afterwards
reveals
himself
in
the
person
of
christ
as
a
redeemer
hence
arises
a
twofold
knowledge
of
him
of
which
the
former
is
first
to
be
considered
and
the
other
will
follow
in
its
proper
place
for
though
our
mind
can
not
conceive
of
god
without
ascribing
some
worship
to
him
it
will
not
be
sufficient
merely
to
apprehend
that
he
is
the
only
proper
object
of
universal
worship
and
adoration
unless
we
are
also
persuaded
that
he
is
the
fountain
of
all
good
and
seek
for
none
but
in
him
this
i
maintain
not
only
because
he
sustains
the
universe
as
he
once
made
it
by
his
infinite
power
governs
it
by
his
wisdom
preserves
it
by
his
goodness
and
especially
reigns
over
the
human
race
in
righteousness
and
judgment
exercising
a
merciful
forbearance
and
defending
them
by
his
protection
but
because
there
can
not
be
found
the
least
particle
of
wisdom
light
righteousness
power
rectitude
or
sincere
truth
which
does
not
proceed
from
him
and
claim
him
for
its
author
we
should
therefore
learn
to
expect
and
supplicate
all
these
things
from
him
and
thankfully
to
acknowledge
what
he
gives
us
for
this
sense
of
the
divine
perfections
is
calculated
to
teach
us
piety
which
produces
religion
by
piety
i
mean
a
reverence
and
love
of
god
arising
from
a
knowledge
of
his
benefits
for
till
men
are
sensible
that
they
owe
every
thing
to
god
that
they
are
supported
by
his
paternal
care
that
he
is
the
author
of
all
the
blessings
they
enjoy
and
that
nothing
should
be
sought
independently
of
him
they
will
never
voluntarily
submit
to
his
authority
they
will
never
truly
and
cordially
devote
themselves
to
his
service
unless
they
rely
upon
him
alone
for
true
felicity
ii
cold
and
frivolous
then
are
the
speculations
of
those
who
employ
themselves
in
disquisitions
on
the
essence
of
god
when
it
would
be
more
interesting
to
us
to
become
acquainted
with
his
character
and
to
know
what
is
agreeable
to
his
nature
for
what
end
is
answered
by
professing
with
epicurus
that
there
is
a
god
who
discarding
all
concern
about
the
world
indulges
himself
in
perpetual
inactivity
what
benefit
arises
from
the
knowledge
of
a
god
with
whom
we
have
no
concern
our
knowledge
of
god
should
rather
tend
first
to
teach
us
fear
and
reverence
and
secondly
to
instruct
us
to
implore
all
good
at
his
hand
and
to
render
him
the
praise
of
all
that
we
receive
for
how
can
you
entertain
a
thought
of
god
without
immediately
reflecting
that
being
a
creature
of
his
formation
you
must
by
right
of
creation
be
subject
to
his
authority
that
you
are
indebted
to
him
for
your
life
and
that
all
your
actions
should
be
done
with
reference
to
him
if
this
be
true
it
certainly
follows
that
your
life
is
miserably
corrupt
unless
it
be
regulated
by
a
desire
of
obeying
him
since
his
will
ought
to
be
the
rule
of
our
conduct
nor
can
you
have
a
clear
view
of
him
without
discovering
him
to
be
the
fountain
and
origin
of
all
good
this
would
produce
a
desire
of
union
to
him
and
confidence
in
him
if
the
human
mind
were
not
seduced
by
its
own
depravity
from
the
right
path
of
investigation
for
even
at
the
first
the
pious
mind
dreams
not
of
any
imaginary
deity
but
contemplates
only
the
one
true
god
and
concerning
him
indulges
not
the
fictions
of
fancy
but
content
with
believing
him
to
be
such
as
he
reveals
himself
uses
the
most
diligent
and
unremitting
caution
lest
it
should
fall
into
error
by
a
rash
and
presumptuous
transgression
of
his
will
he
who
thus
knows
him
sensible
that
all
things
are
subject
to
his
control
confides
in
him
as
his
guardian
and
protector
and
unreservedly
commits
himself
to
his
care
assured
that
he
is
the
author
of
all
blessings
in
distress
or
want
he
immediately
flies
to
his
protection
and
expects
his
aid
persuaded
of
his
goodness
and
mercy
he
relies
on
him
with
unlimited
confidence
nor
doubts
of
finding
in
his
clemency
a
remedy
provided
for
all
his
evils
knowing
him
to
be
his
lord
and
father
he
concludes
that
he
ought
to
mark
his
government
in
all
things
revere
his
majesty
endeavour
to
promote
his
glory
and
obey
his
commands
perceiving
him
to
be
a
just
judge
armed
with
severity
for
the
punishment
of
crimes
he
keeps
his
tribunal
always
in
view
and
is
restrained
by
fear
from
provoking
his
wrath
yet
he
is
not
so
terrified
at
the
apprehension
of
his
justice
as
to
wish
to
evade
it
even
if
escape
were
possible
but
loves
him
as
much
in
punishing
the
wicked
as
in
blessing
the
pious
because
he
believes
it
as
necessary
to
his
glory
to
punish
the
impious
and
abandoned
as
to
reward
the
righteous
with
eternal
life
besides
he
restrains
himself
from
sin
not
merely
from
a
dread
of
vengeance
but
because
he
loves
and
reveres
god
as
his
father
honours
and
worships
him
as
his
lord
and
even
though
there
were
no
hell
would
shudder
at
the
thought
of
offending
him
see
then
the
nature
of
pure
and
genuine
religion
it
consists
in
faith
united
with
a
serious
fear
of
god
comprehending
a
voluntary
reverence
and
producing
legitimate
worship
agreeable
to
the
injunctions
of
the
law
and
this
requires
to
be
the
more
carefully
remarked
because
men
in
general
render
to
god
a
formal
worship
but
very
few
truly
reverence
him
while
great
ostentation
in
ceremonies
is
universally
displayed
but
sincerity
of
heart
is
rarely
to
be
found
chapter
iii
the
human
mind
naturally
endued
with
the
knowledge
of
god
we
lay
it
down
as
a
position
not
to
be
controverted
that
the
human
mind
even
by
natural
instinct
possesses
some
sense
of
a
deity
for
that
no
man
might
shelter
himself
under
the
pretext
of
ignorance
god
hath
given
to
all
some
apprehension
of
his
existence
the
memory
of
which
he
frequently
and
insensibly
renews
so
that
as
men
universally
know
that
there
is
a
god
and
that
he
is
their
maker
they
must
be
condemned
by
their
own
testimony
for
not
having
worshipped
him
and
consecrated
their
lives
to
his
service
if
we
seek
for
ignorance
of
a
deity
it
is
nowhere
more
likely
to
be
found
than
among
tribes
the
most
stupid
and
furthest
from
civilization
but
as
the
celebrated
cicero
observes
there
is
no
nation
so
barbarous
no
race
so
savage
as
not
to
be
firmly
persuaded
of
the
being
of
a
god
even
those
who
in
other
respects
appear
to
differ
but
little
from
brutes
always
retain
some
sense
of
religion
so
fully
are
the
minds
of
men
possessed
with
this
common
principle
which
is
closely
interwoven
with
their
original
composition
now
since
there
has
never
been
a
country
or
family
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
totally
destitute
of
religion
it
is
a
tacit
confession
that
some
sense
of
the
divinity
is
inscribed
on
every
heart
of
this
opinion
idolatry
itself
furnishes
ample
proof
for
we
know
how
reluctantly
man
would
degrade
himself
to
exalt
other
creatures
above
him
his
preference
of
worshipping
a
piece
of
wood
or
stone
to
being
thought
to
have
no
god
evinces
the
impression
of
a
deity
on
the
human
mind
to
be
very
strong
the
obliteration
of
which
is
more
difficult
than
a
total
change
of
the
natural
disposition
and
this
is
certainly
changed
whenever
man
leaves
his
natural
pride
and
voluntarily
descends
to
such
meannesses
under
the
notion
of
worshipping
god
ii
it
is
most
absurd
then
to
pretend
as
is
asserted
by
some
that
religion
was
the
contrivance
of
a
few
subtle
and
designing
men
a
political
machine
to
confine
the
simple
multitude
to
their
duty
while
those
who
inculcated
the
worship
of
god
on
others
were
themselves
far
from
believing
that
any
god
existed
i
confess
indeed
that
artful
men
have
introduced
many
inventions
into
religion
to
fill
the
vulgar
with
reverence
and
strike
them
with
terror
in
order
to
obtain
the
greater
command
over
their
minds
but
this
they
never
could
have
accomplished
if
the
minds
of
men
had
not
previously
been
possessed
of
a
firm
persuasion
of
the
existence
of
god
from
which
the
propensity
to
religion
proceeds
and
that
they
who
cunningly
imposed
on
the
illiterate
under
the
pretext
of
religion
were
themselves
wholly
destitute
of
any
knowledge
of
god
is
quite
incredible
for
though
there
were
some
in
ancient
times
and
many
arise
in
the
present
age
who
deny
the
existence
of
god
yet
in
spite
of
their
reluctance
they
are
continually
receiving
proofs
of
what
they
desire
to
disbelieve
we
read
of
no
one
guilty
of
more
audacious
or
unbridled
contempt
of
the
deity
than
caligula
yet
no
man
ever
trembled
with
greater
distress
at
any
instance
of
divine
wrath
so
that
he
was
constrained
to
dread
the
divinity
whom
he
professed
to
despise
this
you
may
always
see
exemplified
in
persons
of
similar
character
for
the
most
audacious
contemners
of
god
are
most
alarmed
even
at
the
noise
of
a
falling
leaf
whence
arises
this
but
from
the
vengeance
of
the
divine
majesty
smiting
their
consciences
the
more
powerfully
in
proportion
to
their
efforts
to
fly
from
it
they
try
every
refuge
to
hide
themselves
from
the
lord
s
presence
and
to
efface
it
from
their
minds
but
their
attempts
to
elude
it
are
all
in
vain
though
it
may
seem
to
disappear
for
a
moment
it
presently
returns
with
increased
violence
so
that
if
they
have
any
remission
of
the
anguish
of
conscience
it
resembles
the
sleep
of
persons
intoxicated
or
subject
to
frenzy
who
enjoy
no
placid
rest
while
sleeping
being
continually
harassed
with
horrible
and
tremendous
dreams
the
impious
themselves
therefore
exemplify
the
observation
that
the
idea
of
a
god
is
never
lost
in
the
human
mind
iii
it
will
always
be
evident
to
persons
of
correct
judgment
that
the
idea
of
a
deity
impressed
on
the
mind
of
man
is
indelible
that
all
have
by
nature
an
innate
persuasion
of
the
divine
existence
a
persuasion
inseparable
from
their
very
constitution
we
have
abundant
evidence
in
the
contumacy
of
the
wicked
whose
furious
struggles
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
fear
of
god
are
unavailing
though
diagoras
and
others
like
him
turn
to
ridicule
what
all
ages
have
believed
of
religion
though
dionysius
scoff
at
the
judgment
of
heaven
is
but
a
forced
laughter
for
the
worm
of
a
guilty
conscience
torments
them
within
worse
than
if
they
were
seared
with
hot
irons
i
agree
not
with
cicero
that
errors
in
process
of
time
become
obsolete
and
that
religion
is
increased
and
ameliorated
daily
for
the
world
as
will
shortly
be
observed
uses
its
utmost
endeavours
to
banish
all
knowledge
of
god
and
tries
every
method
of
corrupting
his
worship
i
only
maintain
that
while
the
stupid
insensibility
which
the
wicked
wish
to
acquire
to
promote
their
contempt
of
god
preys
upon
their
minds
yet
the
sense
of
a
deity
which
they
ardently
desire
to
extinguish
is
still
strong
and
frequently
discovers
itself
whence
we
infer
that
this
is
a
doctrine
not
first
to
be
learned
in
the
schools
but
which
every
man
from
his
birth
is
and
which
though
many
strain
every
nerve
to
banish
it
from
them
yet
nature
itself
permits
none
to
forget
now
if
the
end
for
which
all
men
are
born
and
live
be
to
know
god
unless
the
knowledge
of
god
have
reached
this
point
it
is
uncertain
and
vain
is
evident
that
all
who
direct
not
every
thought
and
action
of
life
to
this
end
are
degenerated
from
the
law
of
their
creation
of
this
the
heathen
philosophers
themselves
were
not
ignorant
this
was
plato
s
meaning
when
he
taught
that
the
chief
good
of
the
soul
consists
in
similitude
to
god
when
the
soul
having
a
clear
knowledge
of
him
is
wholly
transformed
into
his
likeness
the
reasoning
also
of
gryllus
in
plutarch
is
very
accurate
when
he
affirms
that
men
entirely
destitute
of
religion
not
only
do
not
excel
the
brutes
but
are
in
many
respects
far
more
wretched
being
obnoxious
to
evil
under
so
many
forms
and
always
dragging
on
a
tumultuous
and
restless
life
the
worship
of
god
is
therefore
the
only
thing
which
renders
men
superior
to
brutes
and
makes
them
aspire
to
immortality
chapter
iv
this
knowledge
extinguished
or
corrupted
partly
by
ignorance
partly
by
wickedness
while
experience
testifies
that
the
seeds
of
religion
are
sown
by
god
in
every
heart
we
scarcely
find
one
man
in
a
hundred
who
cherishes
what
he
has
received
and
not
one
in
whom
they
grow
to
maturity
much
less
bear
fruit
in
due
season
some
perhaps
grow
vain
in
their
own
superstitions
while
others
revolt
from
god
with
intentional
wickedness
but
all
degenerate
from
the
true
knowledge
of
him
the
fact
is
that
no
genuine
piety
remains
in
the
world
but
in
saying
that
some
fall
into
superstition
through
error
i
would
not
insinuate
that
their
ignorance
excuses
them
from
guilt
because
their
blindness
is
always
connected
with
pride
vanity
and
contumacy
pride
and
vanity
are
discovered
when
miserable
men
in
seeking
after
god
rise
not
as
they
ought
above
their
own
level
but
judge
of
him
according
to
their
carnal
stupidity
and
leave
the
proper
path
of
investigation
in
pursuit
of
speculations
as
vain
as
they
are
curious
their
conceptions
of
him
are
formed
not
according
to
the
representations
he
gives
of
himself
but
by
the
inventions
of
their
own
presumptuous
imaginations
this
gulf
being
opened
whatever
course
they
take
they
must
be
rushing
forwards
to
destruction
none
of
their
subsequent
attempts
for
the
worship
or
service
of
god
can
be
considered
as
rendered
to
him
because
they
worship
not
him
but
a
figment
of
their
own
brains
in
his
stead
this
depravity
paul
expressly
remarks
professing
themselves
to
be
wise
they
became
he
had
before
said
they
became
vain
in
their
but
lest
any
should
exculpate
them
he
adds
that
they
were
deservedly
blinded
because
not
content
within
the
bounds
of
sobriety
but
arrogating
to
themselves
more
than
was
right
they
wilfully
darkened
and
even
infatuated
themselves
with
pride
vanity
and
perverseness
whence
it
follows
that
their
folly
is
inexcusable
which
originates
not
only
in
a
vain
curiosity
but
in
false
confidence
and
an
immoderate
desire
to
exceed
the
limits
of
human
knowledge
ii
david
s
assertion
that
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
is
primarily
as
we
shall
soon
see
in
another
place
to
be
restricted
to
those
who
extinguish
the
light
of
nature
and
wilfully
stupefy
themselves
for
we
see
many
become
hardened
by
bold
and
habitual
transgressions
striving
to
banish
all
remembrance
of
god
which
the
instinct
of
nature
is
still
suggesting
to
their
minds
to
render
their
madness
more
detestable
he
introduces
them
as
expressly
denying
the
existence
of
god
not
that
they
deprive
him
of
his
being
but
because
they
rob
him
of
his
justice
and
providence
shutting
him
up
as
an
idler
in
heaven
now
as
nothing
would
be
more
inconsistent
with
deity
than
to
abandon
the
government
of
the
world
leave
it
to
fortune
and
connive
at
the
crimes
of
men
that
they
might
wanton
with
impunity
extinguishes
all
fear
of
the
heavenly
judgment
and
indulges
himself
in
security
denies
that
there
is
any
god
after
the
impious
have
wilfully
shut
their
own
eyes
it
is
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
upon
them
to
darken
their
understandings
so
that
seeing
they
may
not
perceive
david
is
the
best
interpreter
of
his
own
meaning
in
another
place
where
he
says
the
wicked
have
no
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
and
again
that
they
encourage
themselves
in
their
iniquities
with
the
flattering
persuasion
that
god
doth
not
see
them
though
they
are
constrained
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of
god
yet
they
rob
him
of
his
glory
by
detracting
from
his
power
for
as
god
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
can
not
deny
himself
because
he
perpetually
remains
like
himself
who
feign
him
to
be
a
vain
and
lifeless
image
are
truly
said
to
deny
god
it
must
also
be
remarked
that
though
they
strive
against
their
own
natural
understanding
and
desire
not
only
to
banish
him
thence
but
even
to
annihilate
him
in
heaven
their
insensibility
can
never
prevail
so
as
to
prevent
god
from
sometimes
recalling
them
to
his
tribunal
but
as
no
dread
restrains
them
from
violent
opposition
to
the
divine
will
it
is
evident
as
long
as
they
are
carried
away
with
such
a
blind
impetuosity
that
they
are
governed
by
a
brutish
forgetfulness
of
god
iii
thus
is
overthrown
the
vain
excuse
pleaded
by
many
for
their
superstition
for
they
satisfy
themselves
with
any
attention
to
religion
however
preposterous
not
considering
that
the
divine
will
is
the
perpetual
rule
to
which
true
religion
ought
to
be
conformed
that
god
ever
continues
like
himself
that
he
is
no
spectre
or
phantasm
to
be
metamorphosed
according
to
the
fancy
of
every
individual
it
is
easy
to
see
how
superstition
mocks
god
with
hypocritical
services
while
it
attempts
to
please
him
for
embracing
only
those
things
which
he
declares
he
disregards
it
either
contemptuously
practises
or
even
openly
rejects
what
he
prescribes
and
declares
to
be
pleasing
in
his
sight
persons
who
introduce
methods
of
worshipping
god
really
worship
and
adore
the
creature
of
their
distempered
imaginations
for
they
would
never
have
dared
to
trifle
in
such
a
manner
with
god
if
they
had
not
first
feigned
a
god
conformable
to
their
own
false
and
foolish
notions
wherefore
the
apostle
pronounces
a
vague
and
unsettled
notion
concerning
the
deity
to
be
ignorance
of
god
when
ye
knew
not
god
says
he
ye
did
service
unto
them
which
by
nature
were
no
and
in
another
place
he
speaks
of
the
ephesians
as
having
been
without
god
while
they
were
strangers
to
a
right
knowledge
of
the
only
true
god
nor
in
this
respect
is
it
of
much
importance
whether
you
imagine
to
yourself
one
god
or
more
for
in
either
case
you
depart
and
revolt
from
the
true
god
and
forsaking
him
you
have
nothing
left
you
but
an
execrable
idol
we
must
therefore
decide
with
lactantius
that
there
is
no
legitimate
religion
unconnected
with
truth
iv
another
sin
is
that
they
never
think
of
god
but
against
their
inclinations
nor
approach
him
till
their
reluctance
is
overcome
by
constraint
and
then
they
are
influenced
not
by
a
voluntary
fear
proceeding
from
reverence
of
the
divine
majesty
but
by
a
servile
and
constrained
fear
extorted
by
the
divine
judgment
which
they
dread
because
it
is
inevitable
at
the
same
time
that
they
hate
it
now
to
impiety
and
to
this
species
of
it
alone
is
applicable
that
assertion
of
statius
that
fear
first
made
gods
in
the
world
they
whose
minds
are
alienated
from
the
righteousness
of
god
earnestly
desire
the
subversion
of
that
tribunal
which
they
know
to
be
established
for
the
punishment
of
transgressions
against
it
with
this
disposition
they
wage
war
against
the
lord
who
can
not
be
deprived
of
his
judgment
but
when
they
apprehend
his
irresistible
arm
to
be
impending
over
their
heads
unable
to
avert
or
evade
it
they
tremble
with
fear
that
they
may
not
seem
altogether
to
despise
him
whose
majesty
troubles
them
they
practise
some
form
of
religion
at
the
same
time
not
ceasing
to
pollute
themselves
with
vices
of
every
kind
and
to
add
one
flagitious
act
to
another
till
they
have
violated
every
part
of
god
s
holy
law
and
dissipated
all
its
righteousness
it
is
certain
at
least
that
they
are
not
prevented
by
that
pretended
fear
of
god
from
enjoying
pleasure
and
satisfaction
in
their
sins
practising
and
preferring
the
indulgence
of
their
own
carnal
intemperance
to
the
salutary
restraints
of
the
holy
spirit
but
that
being
a
false
and
vain
shadow
of
religion
and
scarcely
worthy
even
to
be
called
its
shadow
is
easy
to
infer
the
wide
difference
between
such
a
confused
notion
of
god
and
the
piety
which
is
instilled
only
into
the
minds
of
the
faithful
and
is
the
source
of
religion
yet
hypocrites
who
are
flying
from
god
resort
to
the
artifices
of
superstition
for
the
sake
of
appearing
devoted
to
him
for
whereas
the
whole
tenor
of
their
life
ought
to
be
a
perpetual
course
of
obedience
to
him
they
make
no
scruple
of
rebelling
against
him
in
almost
all
their
actions
only
endeavouring
to
appease
him
with
a
few
paltry
sacrifices
whereas
he
ought
to
be
served
with
sanctity
of
life
and
integrity
of
heart
they
invent
frivolous
trifles
and
worthless
observances
to
conciliate
his
favour
they
abandon
themselves
to
their
impurities
with
the
greater
licentiousness
because
they
confide
in
being
able
to
discharge
all
their
duty
to
him
by
ridiculous
expiations
in
a
word
whereas
their
confidence
ought
to
be
placed
on
him
they
neglect
him
and
depend
upon
themselves
or
on
other
creatures
at
length
they
involve
themselves
in
such
a
vast
accumulation
of
errors
that
those
sparks
which
enable
them
to
discover
the
glory
of
god
are
smothered
and
at
last
extinguished
by
the
criminal
darkness
of
iniquity
that
seed
which
it
is
impossible
to
eradicate
a
sense
of
the
existence
of
a
deity
yet
remains
but
so
corrupted
as
to
produce
only
the
worst
of
fruits
yet
this
is
a
further
proof
of
what
i
now
contend
for
that
an
idea
of
god
is
naturally
engraved
on
the
hearts
of
men
since
necessity
extorts
a
confession
of
it
even
from
reprobates
themselves
in
the
moment
of
tranquillity
they
facetiously
mock
the
divine
being
and
with
loquacious
impertinence
derogate
from
his
power
but
if
any
despair
oppress
them
it
stimulates
them
to
seek
him
and
dictates
concise
prayers
which
prove
that
they
are
not
altogether
ignorant
of
god
but
that
what
ought
to
have
appeared
before
had
been
suppressed
by
obstinacy
chapter
the
knowledge
of
god
conspicuous
in
the
formation
and
continual
government
of
the
world
as
the
perfection
of
a
happy
life
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
god
that
no
man
might
be
precluded
from
attaining
felicity
god
hath
not
only
sown
in
the
minds
of
men
the
seed
of
religion
already
mentioned
but
hath
manifested
himself
in
the
formation
of
every
part
of
the
world
and
daily
presents
himself
to
public
view
in
such
a
manner
that
they
can
not
open
their
eyes
without
being
constrained
to
behold
him
his
essence
indeed
is
incomprehensible
so
that
his
majesty
is
not
to
be
perceived
by
the
human
senses
but
on
all
his
works
he
hath
inscribed
his
glory
in
characters
so
clear
unequivocal
and
striking
that
the
most
illiterate
and
stupid
can
not
exculpate
themselves
by
the
plea
of
ignorance
the
psalmist
therefore
with
great
propriety
exclaims
he
covereth
himself
with
light
as
with
a
garment
as
if
he
had
said
that
his
first
appearance
in
visible
apparel
was
at
the
creation
of
the
world
when
he
displayed
those
glories
which
are
still
conspicuous
on
every
side
in
the
same
place
the
psalmist
compares
the
expanded
heavens
to
a
royal
pavilion
says
that
he
layeth
the
beams
of
his
chambers
in
the
waters
maketh
the
clouds
his
chariot
walketh
upon
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
maketh
the
winds
and
the
lightnings
his
swift
messengers
and
because
the
glory
of
his
power
and
wisdom
is
more
refulgently
displayed
above
heaven
is
generally
called
his
palace
and
in
the
first
place
whithersoever
you
turn
your
eyes
there
is
not
an
atom
of
the
world
in
which
you
can
not
behold
some
brilliant
sparks
at
least
of
his
glory
but
you
can
not
at
one
view
take
a
survey
of
this
most
ample
and
beautiful
machine
in
all
its
vast
extent
without
being
completely
overwhelmed
with
its
infinite
splendour
wherefore
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
elegantly
represents
the
worlds
as
the
manifestations
of
invisible
things
for
the
exact
symmetry
of
the
universe
is
a
mirror
in
which
we
may
contemplate
the
otherwise
invisible
god
for
which
reason
the
psalmist
attributes
to
the
celestial
bodies
a
language
universally
known
for
they
afford
a
testimony
of
the
deity
too
evident
to
escape
the
observation
even
of
the
most
ignorant
people
in
the
world
but
the
apostle
more
distinctly
asserts
this
manifestation
to
men
of
what
was
useful
to
be
known
concerning
god
for
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
ii
of
his
wonderful
wisdom
both
heaven
and
earth
contain
innumerable
proofs
not
only
those
more
abstruse
things
which
are
the
subjects
of
astronomy
medicine
and
the
whole
science
of
physics
but
those
things
which
force
themselves
on
the
view
of
the
most
illiterate
of
mankind
so
that
they
can
not
open
their
eyes
without
being
constrained
to
witness
them
adepts
indeed
in
those
liberal
arts
or
persons
just
initiated
into
them
are
thereby
enabled
to
proceed
much
further
in
investigating
the
secrets
of
divine
wisdom
yet
ignorance
of
those
sciences
prevents
no
man
from
such
a
survey
of
the
workmanship
of
god
as
is
more
than
sufficient
to
excite
his
admiration
of
the
divine
architect
in
disquisitions
concerning
the
motions
of
the
stars
in
fixing
their
situations
measuring
their
distances
and
distinguishing
their
peculiar
properties
there
is
need
of
skill
exactness
and
industry
and
the
providence
of
god
being
more
clearly
revealed
by
these
discoveries
the
mind
ought
to
rise
to
a
sublimer
elevation
for
the
contemplation
of
his
glory
but
since
the
meanest
and
most
illiterate
of
mankind
who
are
furnished
with
no
other
assistance
than
their
own
eyes
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
excellence
of
the
divine
skill
exhibiting
itself
in
that
endless
yet
regular
variety
of
the
innumerable
celestial
host
is
evident
that
the
lord
abundantly
manifests
his
wisdom
to
every
individual
on
earth
thus
it
belongs
to
a
man
of
preëminent
ingenuity
to
examine
with
the
critical
exactness
of
galen
the
connection
the
symmetry
the
beauty
and
the
use
of
the
various
parts
of
the
human
body
but
the
composition
of
the
human
body
is
universally
acknowledged
to
be
so
ingenious
as
to
render
its
maker
the
object
of
deserved
admiration
iii
and
therefore
some
of
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
have
justly
called
man
a
microcosm
or
world
in
miniature
because
he
is
an
eminent
specimen
of
the
power
goodness
and
wisdom
of
god
and
contains
in
him
wonders
enough
to
occupy
the
attention
of
our
minds
if
we
are
not
indisposed
to
such
a
study
for
this
reason
paul
having
remarked
that
the
blind
might
feel
after
god
and
find
him
immediately
adds
that
he
is
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
because
every
man
has
undoubtedly
an
inward
perception
of
the
celestial
goodness
by
which
he
is
quickened
but
if
to
attain
some
ideas
of
god
it
be
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
beyond
ourselves
what
an
unpardonable
indolence
is
it
in
those
who
will
not
descend
into
themselves
that
they
may
find
him
for
the
same
reason
david
having
briefly
celebrated
the
wonderful
name
and
honour
of
god
which
are
universally
conspicuous
immediately
exclaims
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
again
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
thou
hast
ordained
thus
declaring
not
only
that
the
human
race
is
a
clear
mirror
of
the
works
of
god
but
that
even
infants
at
the
breast
have
tongues
so
eloquent
for
the
publication
of
his
glory
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
other
orators
whence
he
hesitates
not
to
produce
them
as
fully
capable
of
confuting
the
madness
of
those
whose
diabolical
pride
would
wish
to
extinguish
the
name
of
god
hence
also
what
paul
quotes
from
aratus
that
we
are
the
offspring
of
god
since
his
adorning
us
with
such
great
excellence
has
proved
him
to
be
our
father
so
from
the
dictates
of
common
sense
and
experience
the
heathen
poets
called
him
the
father
of
men
nor
will
any
man
freely
devote
himself
to
the
service
of
god
unless
he
have
been
allured
to
love
and
reverence
him
by
first
experiencing
his
paternal
love
iv
but
herein
appears
the
vile
ingratitude
of
while
they
ought
to
be
proclaiming
the
praises
of
god
for
the
wonderful
skill
displayed
in
their
formation
and
the
inestimable
bounties
he
bestows
on
them
they
are
only
inflated
with
the
greater
pride
they
perceive
how
wonderfully
god
works
within
them
and
experience
teaches
them
what
a
variety
of
blessings
they
receive
from
his
liberality
they
are
constrained
to
know
whether
willingly
or
not
that
these
are
proofs
of
his
divinity
yet
they
suppress
this
knowledge
in
their
hearts
indeed
they
need
not
go
out
of
themselves
provided
they
do
not
by
arrogating
to
themselves
what
is
given
from
heaven
smother
the
light
which
illuminates
their
minds
to
a
clearer
discovery
of
god
even
in
the
present
day
there
are
many
men
of
monstrous
dispositions
who
hesitate
not
to
pervert
all
the
seeds
of
divinity
sown
in
the
nature
of
man
in
order
to
bury
in
oblivion
the
name
of
god
how
detestable
is
this
frenzy
that
man
discovering
in
his
body
and
soul
a
hundred
vestiges
of
god
should
make
this
very
excellence
a
pretext
for
the
denial
of
his
being
they
will
not
say
that
they
are
distinguished
from
the
brutes
by
chance
but
they
ascribe
it
to
nature
which
they
consider
as
the
author
of
all
things
and
remove
god
out
of
sight
they
perceive
most
exquisite
workmanship
in
all
their
members
from
the
head
to
the
feet
here
also
they
substitute
nature
in
the
place
of
god
but
above
all
the
rapid
motions
of
the
soul
its
noble
faculties
and
excellent
talents
discover
a
divinity
not
easily
concealed
unless
the
epicureans
like
the
cyclops
from
this
eminence
should
audaciously
wage
war
against
god
do
all
the
treasures
of
heavenly
wisdom
concur
in
the
government
of
a
worm
five
feet
in
length
and
shall
the
universe
be
destitute
of
this
privilege
to
state
that
there
is
in
the
soul
a
certain
machinery
corresponding
to
every
part
of
the
body
is
so
far
from
obscuring
the
divine
glory
that
it
is
rather
an
illustration
of
it
let
epicurus
answer
what
concourse
of
atoms
in
the
concoction
of
food
and
drink
distributes
part
into
excrements
and
part
into
blood
and
causes
the
several
members
to
perform
their
different
offices
with
as
much
diligence
as
if
so
many
souls
by
common
consent
governed
one
body
but
my
present
concern
is
not
with
that
sty
of
swines
i
rather
address
those
who
influenced
by
preposterous
subtilties
would
indirectly
employ
that
frigid
dogma
of
aristotle
to
destroy
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
deprive
god
of
his
rights
for
because
the
organs
of
the
body
are
directed
by
the
faculties
of
the
soul
they
pretend
the
soul
to
be
so
united
to
the
body
as
to
be
incapable
of
subsisting
without
it
and
by
their
eulogies
of
nature
do
all
they
can
to
suppress
the
name
of
god
but
the
powers
of
the
soul
are
far
from
being
limited
to
functions
subservient
to
the
body
for
what
concern
has
the
body
in
measuring
the
heavens
counting
the
number
of
the
stars
computing
their
several
magnitudes
and
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
their
respective
distances
of
the
celerity
or
tardiness
of
their
courses
and
of
the
degrees
of
their
various
declinations
i
grant
indeed
the
usefulness
of
astronomy
but
only
remark
that
in
these
profound
researches
relating
to
the
celestial
orbs
there
is
no
corporeal
coöperation
but
that
the
soul
has
its
functions
distinct
from
the
body
i
have
proposed
one
example
whence
inferences
may
readily
be
drawn
by
the
readers
the
manifold
agility
of
the
soul
which
enables
it
to
take
a
survey
of
heaven
and
earth
to
join
the
past
and
the
present
to
retain
the
memory
of
things
heard
long
ago
to
conceive
of
whatever
it
chooses
by
the
help
of
imagination
its
ingenuity
also
in
the
invention
of
such
admirable
arts
certain
proofs
of
the
divinity
in
man
besides
in
sleep
it
not
only
turns
and
moves
itself
round
but
conceives
many
useful
ideas
reasons
on
various
subjects
and
even
divines
future
events
what
shall
we
say
but
that
the
vestiges
of
immortality
impressed
upon
man
are
absolutely
indelible
now
what
reason
can
be
given
why
man
who
is
of
divine
original
should
not
acknowledge
his
creator
shall
we
indeed
by
the
judgment
with
which
we
are
endued
discern
right
from
wrong
and
shall
there
be
no
judge
in
heaven
shall
we
even
in
our
sleep
have
some
remains
of
intelligence
and
shall
there
be
no
god
to
govern
the
world
shall
we
be
esteemed
the
inventers
of
so
many
useful
arts
that
god
may
be
defrauded
of
his
praise
whereas
experience
abundantly
teaches
that
all
we
have
is
variously
distributed
to
us
by
some
superior
being
the
clamour
of
some
about
a
secret
inspiration
animating
the
whole
world
is
not
only
weak
but
altogether
profane
they
are
pleased
with
the
celebrated
passage
of
know
first
a
spirit
with
an
active
flame
fills
feeds
and
animates
this
mighty
frame
runs
through
the
watery
worlds
the
fields
of
air
the
ponderous
earth
the
depths
of
heaven
and
there
glows
in
the
sun
and
moon
and
burns
in
every
star
thus
mingling
with
the
mass
the
general
soul
lives
in
the
parts
and
agitates
the
whole
from
that
celestial
energy
began
the
brute
th
imperial
race
of
man
the
painted
birds
who
wing
th
aërial
plain
and
all
the
mighty
monsters
of
the
main
their
souls
at
first
from
high
olympus
came
just
as
if
the
world
which
is
a
theatre
erected
for
displaying
the
glory
of
god
were
its
own
creator
for
thus
writes
the
same
poet
in
another
place
following
the
common
opinion
of
the
greeks
and
led
by
such
wonders
sages
have
opined
that
bees
have
portions
of
a
heavenly
mind
that
god
pervades
and
like
one
common
soul
fills
feeds
and
animates
the
world
s
great
whole
that
flocks
herds
beasts
and
men
from
him
receive
their
vital
breath
in
him
all
move
and
live
that
souls
discerpt
from
him
shall
never
die
but
back
resolved
to
god
and
heaven
shall
fly
and
live
for
ever
in
the
starry
see
the
efficacy
of
that
jejune
speculation
concerning
a
universal
mind
animating
and
actuating
the
world
in
the
production
and
encouragement
of
piety
in
the
human
heart
this
more
fully
appears
also
from
the
profane
expressions
of
the
filthy
lucretius
which
are
deductions
from
the
same
principle
its
true
tendency
is
to
set
up
a
shadowy
deity
and
to
banish
all
ideas
of
the
true
god
the
proper
object
of
fear
and
worship
i
confess
indeed
that
the
expression
that
nature
is
god
may
be
used
in
a
pious
sense
by
a
pious
mind
but
as
it
is
harsh
and
inconsistent
with
strict
propriety
of
speech
nature
being
rather
an
order
prescribed
by
god
it
is
dangerous
in
matters
so
momentous
and
demanding
peculiar
caution
to
confound
the
deity
with
the
inferior
course
of
his
works
vi
let
us
remember
then
in
every
consideration
of
our
own
nature
that
there
is
one
god
who
governs
all
natures
and
who
expects
us
to
regard
him
to
direct
our
faith
to
him
to
worship
and
invoke
him
for
nothing
is
more
preposterous
than
to
enjoy
such
splendid
advantages
which
proclaim
within
us
their
divine
origin
and
to
neglect
the
author
who
bountifully
bestows
them
now
what
illustrious
specimens
of
his
power
have
we
to
arrest
our
attention
unless
it
be
possible
for
us
not
to
know
what
strength
is
required
to
sustain
with
his
word
this
immense
fabric
of
heaven
and
earth
now
by
his
mere
nod
to
shake
the
heaven
with
roaring
peals
of
thunder
to
consume
whatever
he
choose
with
lightnings
and
set
the
atmosphere
on
fire
with
the
flame
now
to
disturb
it
with
tempests
in
various
forms
and
immediately
if
he
please
to
compose
all
to
instantaneous
serenity
to
restrain
suspended
as
it
were
in
air
the
sea
which
by
its
elevation
seems
to
threaten
the
earth
with
continual
devastation
now
raising
it
in
a
tremendous
manner
by
the
tumultuous
violence
of
the
winds
and
now
appeasing
the
waves
to
render
it
calm
to
this
purpose
are
the
numerous
praises
of
the
power
of
god
drawn
from
the
testimonies
of
nature
particularly
in
the
book
of
job
and
in
the
prophecies
of
isaiah
which
i
now
purposely
omit
as
they
will
be
more
suitably
introduced
when
i
discuss
the
scriptural
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
only
i
wished
at
present
to
hint
that
this
way
of
seeking
god
by
tracing
the
lineaments
which
both
above
and
below
us
exhibit
such
a
lively
adumbration
of
him
is
common
to
aliens
and
to
those
who
belong
to
his
family
his
power
leads
us
to
the
consideration
of
his
eternity
because
he
from
whom
all
things
derive
their
origin
must
necessarily
be
eternal
and
but
if
we
inquire
the
reason
that
induced
him
first
to
create
all
things
and
now
to
preserve
them
we
shall
find
the
sole
cause
to
be
his
own
goodness
but
though
this
be
the
only
cause
it
should
be
more
than
sufficient
to
attract
us
to
love
him
since
according
to
the
psalmist
there
is
no
creature
that
does
not
participate
in
the
effusions
of
his
mercy
vii
in
the
second
species
of
his
works
such
as
happen
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
the
proofs
of
his
perfections
are
equally
clear
for
he
so
regulates
his
providence
in
the
government
of
human
society
that
while
he
exhibits
in
innumerable
ways
his
benignity
and
beneficence
to
all
he
likewise
declares
by
evident
and
daily
indications
his
clemency
to
the
pious
and
his
severity
to
the
wicked
and
ungodly
for
no
doubt
can
be
entertained
respecting
his
punishment
of
flagitious
crimes
inasmuch
as
he
clearly
demonstrates
himself
to
be
the
guardian
and
avenger
of
innocence
in
prospering
with
his
blessing
the
life
of
good
men
in
assisting
their
necessities
assuaging
and
comforting
their
sorrows
alleviating
their
calamities
and
providing
in
all
things
for
their
safety
nor
should
it
perplex
or
eclipse
his
perpetual
rule
of
righteousness
that
he
frequently
permits
the
wicked
and
guilty
for
a
time
to
exult
in
impunity
but
suffers
good
men
to
be
undeservedly
harassed
with
much
adversity
and
even
to
be
oppressed
by
the
iniquitous
malice
of
the
ungodly
we
ought
rather
to
make
a
very
different
reflection
that
when
he
clearly
manifests
his
wrath
in
the
punishment
of
one
sin
he
hates
all
sins
and
that
since
he
now
passes
by
many
sins
unpunished
there
will
be
a
judgment
hereafter
till
which
the
punishment
is
deferred
so
also
what
ample
occasion
he
supplies
us
for
the
consideration
of
his
mercy
while
with
unwearied
benignity
he
pursues
the
miserable
calling
them
back
to
himself
with
more
than
paternal
indulgence
till
his
beneficence
overcomes
their
depravity
viii
to
this
end
the
psalmist
mentioning
that
god
in
desperate
cases
suddenly
and
wonderfully
succors
beyond
all
expectation
those
who
are
miserable
and
ready
to
perish
either
protecting
from
beasts
of
prey
such
as
are
wandering
in
deserts
and
at
length
reconducting
them
into
the
right
way
or
supplying
with
food
the
needy
and
hungry
or
delivering
captives
from
dreary
dungeons
and
iron
chains
or
bringing
the
shipwrecked
safe
into
port
or
healing
the
diseases
of
some
who
are
almost
dead
or
scorching
the
earth
with
excessive
heat
and
drought
or
fertilizing
it
with
the
secret
showers
of
his
mercy
or
elevating
the
meanest
of
the
vulgar
or
degrading
nobles
from
their
dignified
stations
psalmist
i
say
having
proposed
such
examples
as
these
infers
from
them
that
what
are
accounted
fortuitous
accidents
are
so
many
proofs
of
his
heavenly
providence
especially
of
his
paternal
clemency
and
that
hence
the
pious
have
cause
to
rejoice
while
the
mouths
of
the
impious
and
reprobate
are
stopped
but
since
the
majority
of
men
immersed
in
their
errors
are
blind
amidst
the
greatest
opportunities
of
seeing
he
accounts
it
a
rare
instance
of
singular
wisdom
discreetly
to
consider
these
works
of
god
from
the
sight
of
which
some
who
in
other
instances
discover
the
greatest
acuteness
receive
no
benefit
and
notwithstanding
all
the
displays
of
the
glory
of
god
scarcely
one
man
in
a
hundred
is
really
a
spectator
of
it
his
power
and
wisdom
are
equally
conspicuous
his
power
is
illustriously
manifested
when
the
ferocity
of
the
impious
universally
deemed
insuperable
is
quelled
in
an
instant
their
arrogance
subdued
their
strongest
fortresses
demolished
their
weapons
and
armour
broken
in
pieces
their
strength
diminished
their
machinations
confounded
and
they
fall
by
their
own
exertions
when
the
audacity
which
exalted
itself
above
the
heavens
is
thrown
down
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
when
on
the
contrary
the
poor
are
raised
out
of
the
dust
and
the
needy
out
of
the
dunghill
the
oppressed
and
afflicted
extricated
from
distressing
extremities
and
the
desperate
restored
to
a
good
hope
when
the
unarmed
are
victorious
over
those
who
are
armed
the
few
over
the
many
the
weak
over
the
strong
but
his
wisdom
is
eminently
displayed
in
ordering
every
dispensation
at
the
best
possible
time
confounding
the
greatest
worldly
sagacity
taking
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
and
finally
disposing
all
things
according
to
the
dictates
of
the
highest
reason
ix
we
see
that
there
is
no
need
of
any
long
or
laborious
argumentation
to
obtain
and
produce
testimonies
for
illustrating
and
asserting
the
divine
majesty
since
from
the
few
which
we
have
selected
and
cursorily
mentioned
it
appears
that
they
are
every
where
so
evident
and
obvious
as
easily
to
be
distinguished
by
the
eyes
and
pointed
out
with
the
fingers
and
here
it
must
again
be
observed
that
we
are
invited
to
a
knowledge
of
god
not
such
as
content
with
empty
speculation
merely
floats
in
the
brain
but
such
as
will
be
solid
and
fruitful
if
rightly
received
and
rooted
in
our
hearts
for
the
lord
is
manifested
by
his
perfections
perceiving
the
influence
and
enjoying
the
benefits
of
which
we
must
necessarily
be
more
acutely
impressed
with
such
a
knowledge
than
if
we
imagined
a
deity
of
whose
influence
we
had
no
perception
whence
we
conclude
this
to
be
the
right
way
and
the
best
method
of
seeking
god
not
with
presumptuous
curiosity
to
attempt
an
examination
of
his
essence
which
is
rather
to
be
adored
than
too
curiously
investigated
but
to
contemplate
him
in
his
works
in
which
he
approaches
and
familiarizes
and
in
some
measure
communicates
himself
to
us
to
this
the
apostle
referred
when
he
said
that
he
is
not
to
be
sought
far
off
since
by
his
attribute
of
omnipresence
he
dwells
in
every
one
of
us
therefore
david
having
before
confessed
his
greatness
ineffable
after
he
descends
to
the
mention
of
his
works
adds
that
he
will
declare
this
wherefore
it
becomes
us
also
to
apply
ourselves
to
such
an
investigation
of
god
as
may
fill
our
understanding
with
admiration
and
powerfully
interest
our
feelings
and
as
augustine
somewhere
teaches
being
incapable
of
comprehending
him
and
fainting
as
it
were
under
his
immensity
we
must
take
a
view
of
his
works
that
we
may
be
refreshed
with
his
goodness
x
now
such
a
knowledge
ought
not
only
to
excite
us
to
the
worship
of
god
but
likewise
to
awaken
and
arouse
us
to
the
hope
of
a
future
life
for
when
we
consider
that
the
specimens
given
by
the
lord
both
of
his
clemency
and
of
his
severity
are
only
begun
and
not
completed
we
certainly
should
esteem
these
as
preludes
to
greater
things
of
which
the
manifestation
and
full
exhibition
are
deferred
to
another
life
when
we
see
that
pious
men
are
loaded
with
afflictions
by
the
impious
harassed
with
injuries
oppressed
with
calumnies
and
vexed
with
contumelious
and
opprobrious
treatment
that
the
wicked
on
the
contrary
flourish
prosper
obtain
ease
and
dignity
and
all
with
impunity
should
immediately
conclude
that
there
is
another
life
to
which
is
reserved
the
vengeance
due
to
iniquity
and
the
reward
of
righteousness
moreover
when
we
observe
the
faithful
frequently
chastised
by
the
lord
s
rod
we
may
conclude
with
great
certainty
that
the
impious
shall
not
always
escape
his
vengeance
for
that
is
a
wise
observation
of
if
open
punishment
were
now
inflicted
for
every
sin
it
would
be
supposed
that
nothing
would
be
reserved
till
the
last
judgment
again
if
god
now
did
not
openly
punish
any
sin
it
would
be
presumed
that
there
was
no
divine
it
must
therefore
be
confessed
that
in
each
of
the
works
of
god
but
more
especially
in
the
whole
considered
together
there
is
a
bright
exhibition
of
the
divine
perfections
by
which
the
whole
human
race
is
invited
and
allured
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
thence
to
true
and
complete
felicity
but
though
those
perfections
are
most
luminously
portrayed
around
us
we
only
discover
their
principal
tendency
their
use
and
the
end
of
our
contemplation
of
them
when
we
descend
into
our
own
selves
and
consider
by
what
means
god
displays
in
us
his
life
wisdom
and
power
and
exercises
towards
us
his
righteousness
goodness
and
mercy
for
though
david
justly
complains
that
unbelievers
are
fools
because
they
consider
not
the
profound
designs
of
god
in
the
government
of
mankind
yet
there
is
much
truth
in
what
he
says
in
another
the
wonders
of
divine
wisdom
in
this
respect
exceed
in
number
the
hairs
of
our
head
but
as
this
argument
must
be
treated
more
at
large
in
due
course
i
at
present
omit
it
xi
but
notwithstanding
the
clear
representations
given
by
god
in
the
mirror
of
his
works
both
of
himself
and
of
his
everlasting
dominion
such
is
our
stupidity
that
always
inattentive
to
these
obvious
testimonies
we
derive
no
advantage
from
them
for
with
regard
to
the
structure
and
very
beautiful
organization
of
the
world
how
few
of
us
are
there
who
when
lifting
up
their
eyes
to
heaven
or
looking
round
on
the
various
regions
of
the
earth
direct
their
minds
to
the
remembrance
of
the
creator
and
do
not
rather
content
themselves
with
a
view
of
his
works
to
the
total
neglect
of
their
author
and
with
respect
to
those
things
that
daily
happen
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
is
it
not
the
general
opinion
that
men
are
rolled
and
whirled
about
by
the
blind
temerity
of
fortune
rather
than
governed
by
the
providence
of
god
or
if
by
the
guidance
and
direction
of
these
things
we
are
ever
driven
as
all
men
must
sometimes
be
to
the
consideration
of
a
god
yet
when
we
have
rashly
conceived
an
idea
of
some
deity
we
soon
slide
into
our
own
carnal
dreams
or
depraved
inventions
corrupting
by
our
vanity
the
purity
of
divine
truth
we
differ
from
one
another
in
that
each
individual
imbibes
some
peculiarity
of
error
but
we
perfectly
agree
in
a
universal
departure
from
the
one
true
god
to
preposterous
trifles
this
disease
affects
not
only
the
vulgar
and
ignorant
but
the
most
eminent
and
those
who
in
other
things
discover
peculiar
sagacity
how
abundantly
have
all
the
philosophers
in
this
respect
betrayed
their
stupidity
and
folly
for
to
spare
others
chargeable
with
greater
absurdities
plato
himself
the
most
religious
and
judicious
of
them
all
loses
himself
in
his
round
globe
and
what
would
not
befall
others
when
their
principal
men
whose
place
it
was
to
enlighten
the
rest
stumble
upon
such
gross
errors
so
also
while
the
government
of
human
actions
proves
a
providence
too
plainly
to
admit
of
a
denial
men
derive
no
more
advantage
from
it
than
if
they
believed
all
things
to
be
agitated
forwards
and
backwards
by
the
uncertain
caprice
of
fortune
so
great
is
our
propensity
to
vanity
and
error
i
speak
exclusively
of
the
excellent
of
mankind
not
of
the
vulgar
whose
madness
in
the
profanation
of
divine
truth
has
known
no
bounds
xii
hence
that
immense
flood
of
errors
which
has
deluged
the
whole
world
for
every
man
s
understanding
is
like
a
labyrinth
to
him
so
that
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
different
nations
were
drawn
aside
into
various
inventions
and
even
that
almost
every
individual
had
his
own
particular
deity
for
amidst
the
union
of
temerity
and
wantonness
with
ignorance
and
darkness
scarcely
a
man
could
be
found
who
did
not
frame
to
himself
some
idol
or
phantasm
instead
of
god
indeed
the
immense
multitude
of
gods
proceeding
from
the
mind
of
man
resembles
the
ebullition
of
waters
from
a
vast
and
ample
spring
while
every
one
with
an
extreme
licentiousness
of
error
invents
one
thing
or
another
concerning
god
himself
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
compose
a
catalogue
of
the
superstitions
which
have
perplexed
the
world
for
it
would
be
an
endless
task
and
without
a
word
more
being
said
the
horrible
blindness
of
the
human
mind
sufficiently
appears
from
such
a
multiplicity
of
corruptions
i
pass
over
the
rude
and
unlearned
vulgar
but
among
the
philosophers
who
attempted
with
reason
and
learning
to
penetrate
heaven
how
shameful
is
the
diversity
in
proportion
to
the
vigour
of
his
natural
genius
and
the
polish
acquired
by
art
and
science
each
of
them
seemed
to
give
the
more
specious
colouring
to
his
own
opinion
but
on
a
close
inspection
you
will
find
them
all
fading
colours
the
stoics
said
in
their
own
opinion
very
shrewdly
that
from
all
the
parts
of
nature
may
be
collected
various
names
of
god
but
yet
that
the
one
god
is
not
therefore
divided
as
if
we
were
not
already
too
much
inclined
to
vanity
without
being
further
and
more
violently
seduced
into
error
by
the
notion
of
such
a
various
abundance
of
gods
the
mystical
theology
of
the
egyptians
also
shows
that
they
all
sedulously
endeavoured
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
reason
in
the
midst
of
their
folly
and
any
thing
apparently
probable
might
at
first
sight
perhaps
deceive
the
simple
and
incautious
but
there
never
was
any
human
invention
by
which
religion
was
not
basely
corrupted
and
this
confused
diversity
imboldened
the
epicureans
and
other
gross
despisers
of
piety
to
reject
all
idea
of
god
for
seeing
the
wisest
of
men
contending
with
each
other
for
contrary
opinions
they
hesitated
not
from
their
dissensions
and
from
the
frivolous
and
absurd
doctrines
maintained
by
the
different
parties
to
infer
that
it
was
vain
and
foolish
for
men
to
torment
themselves
with
investigations
concerning
god
who
does
not
exist
and
this
they
thought
they
might
do
with
impunity
supposing
that
a
compendious
denial
of
any
god
at
all
would
be
better
than
feigning
uncertain
gods
and
thereby
occasioning
endless
controversies
they
reason
very
ignorantly
or
rather
endeavour
to
conceal
their
own
impiety
behind
the
ignorance
of
men
which
not
at
all
justifies
any
encroachment
on
god
but
from
the
general
confession
that
there
is
no
subject
productive
of
so
many
dissensions
among
the
learned
as
well
as
the
unlearned
it
is
inferred
that
the
minds
of
men
which
err
so
much
in
investigations
concerning
god
are
extremely
blind
and
stupid
in
celestial
mysteries
others
commend
the
answer
of
simonides
who
being
asked
by
hiero
the
tyrant
what
god
was
requested
a
day
to
consider
it
when
the
tyrant
the
next
day
repeated
the
inquiry
he
begged
to
be
allowed
two
days
longer
and
having
often
doubled
the
number
of
days
at
length
answered
the
longer
i
consider
the
subject
the
more
obscure
it
appears
to
he
prudently
suspended
his
opinion
on
a
subject
so
obscure
to
him
yet
this
shows
that
men
who
are
taught
only
by
nature
have
no
certain
sound
or
distinct
knowledge
but
are
confined
to
confused
principles
so
that
they
worship
an
unknown
god
xiii
now
it
must
also
be
maintained
that
whoever
adulterates
the
pure
religion
which
must
necessarily
be
the
case
of
all
who
are
influenced
by
their
own
imagination
he
is
guilty
of
a
departure
from
the
one
god
they
will
profess
indeed
a
different
intention
but
what
they
intend
or
what
they
persuade
themselves
is
of
little
importance
since
the
holy
spirit
pronounces
all
to
be
apostates
who
in
the
darkness
of
their
minds
substitute
demons
in
the
place
of
god
for
this
reason
paul
declares
the
ephesians
to
have
been
without
god
they
had
learned
from
the
gospel
the
worship
of
the
true
god
nor
should
this
be
restricted
to
one
nation
only
since
in
another
place
he
asserts
of
men
in
general
that
they
became
vain
in
their
imaginations
after
the
majesty
of
the
creator
had
been
discovered
to
them
in
the
structure
of
the
world
and
therefore
the
scripture
to
make
room
for
the
only
true
god
condemns
as
false
and
lying
whatever
was
formerly
worshipped
as
divine
among
the
gentiles
and
leaves
no
deity
but
in
mount
sion
where
flourished
the
peculiar
knowledge
of
god
indeed
among
the
gentiles
the
samaritans
in
the
days
of
christ
seemed
to
approach
very
nearly
to
true
piety
yet
we
hear
from
the
mouth
of
christ
that
they
worshipped
they
knew
not
what
whence
it
follows
that
they
were
under
a
vain
and
erroneous
delusion
in
fine
though
they
were
not
all
the
subjects
of
gross
vices
or
open
idolaters
there
was
no
pure
and
approved
religion
their
notions
being
founded
only
in
common
sense
for
though
there
were
a
few
uninfected
with
the
madness
of
the
vulgar
this
assertion
of
paul
remains
unshaken
that
none
of
the
princes
of
this
world
knew
the
wisdom
of
but
if
the
most
exalted
have
been
involved
in
the
darkness
of
error
what
must
be
said
of
the
dregs
of
the
people
wherefore
it
is
not
surprising
if
the
holy
spirit
reject
as
spurious
every
form
of
worship
which
is
of
human
contrivance
because
in
the
mysteries
of
heaven
an
opinion
acquired
by
human
means
though
it
may
not
always
produce
an
immense
mass
of
errors
yet
always
produces
some
and
though
no
worse
consequence
follow
it
is
no
trivial
fault
to
worship
at
an
uncertainty
an
unknown
god
of
which
however
christ
pronounces
all
to
be
guilty
who
have
not
been
taught
by
the
law
what
god
they
ought
to
worship
and
indeed
the
best
legislators
have
proceeded
no
further
than
to
declare
religion
to
be
founded
upon
common
consent
and
even
socrates
in
xenophon
praises
the
answer
of
apollo
which
directed
that
every
man
should
worship
the
gods
according
to
the
rites
of
his
country
and
the
custom
of
his
own
city
but
whence
had
mortals
this
right
of
determining
by
their
own
authority
what
far
exceeds
all
the
world
or
who
could
so
acquiesce
in
the
decrees
of
the
rulers
or
the
ordinances
of
the
people
as
without
hesitation
to
receive
a
god
delivered
to
him
by
the
authority
of
man
every
man
will
rather
abide
by
his
own
judgment
than
be
subject
to
the
will
of
another
since
then
the
following
of
the
custom
of
a
city
or
the
consent
of
antiquity
in
divine
worship
is
too
weak
and
frail
a
bond
of
piety
it
remains
for
god
himself
to
give
a
revelation
concerning
himself
from
heaven
xiv
vain
therefore
is
the
light
afforded
us
in
the
formation
of
the
world
to
illustrate
the
glory
of
its
author
which
though
its
rays
be
diffused
all
around
us
is
insufficient
to
conduct
us
into
the
right
way
some
sparks
indeed
are
kindled
but
smothered
before
they
have
emitted
any
great
degree
of
light
wherefore
the
apostle
in
the
place
before
cited
says
by
faith
we
understand
that
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
god
thus
intimating
that
the
invisible
deity
was
represented
by
such
visible
objects
yet
that
we
have
no
eyes
to
discern
him
unless
they
be
illuminated
through
faith
by
an
internal
revelation
of
god
nor
does
paul
where
he
observes
that
that
which
may
be
known
of
god
is
manifest
in
the
creation
of
the
world
design
such
a
manifestation
as
human
sagacity
may
comprehend
but
rather
shows
that
its
utmost
extent
is
to
render
men
inexcusable
the
same
writer
also
though
in
one
place
he
denies
that
god
is
to
be
traced
far
off
seeing
he
dwells
within
us
yet
teaches
in
another
place
the
consequences
of
such
a
proximity
god
says
he
in
times
past
suffered
all
nations
to
walk
in
their
own
ways
nevertheless
he
left
not
himself
without
witness
in
that
he
did
good
and
gave
us
rain
from
heaven
and
fruitful
seasons
filling
our
hearts
with
food
and
though
the
lord
then
is
not
destitute
of
a
testimony
concerning
himself
while
with
various
and
most
abundant
benignity
he
sweetly
allures
mankind
to
a
knowledge
of
him
yet
they
persist
in
following
their
own
ways
their
pernicious
and
fatal
errors
xv
but
whatever
deficiency
of
natural
ability
prevents
us
from
attaining
the
pure
and
clear
knowledge
of
god
yet
since
that
deficiency
arises
from
our
own
fault
we
are
left
without
any
excuse
nor
indeed
can
we
set
up
any
pretence
of
ignorance
that
will
prevent
our
own
consciences
from
perpetually
accusing
us
of
indolence
and
ingratitude
truly
it
would
be
a
defence
worthy
to
be
admitted
if
a
man
should
plead
that
he
wanted
ears
to
hear
the
truth
for
the
publication
of
which
even
the
mute
creatures
are
supplied
with
most
melodious
voices
if
he
should
allege
that
his
eyes
are
not
capable
of
seeing
what
is
demonstrated
by
the
creatures
without
the
help
of
the
eyes
if
he
should
plead
mental
imbecility
while
all
the
irrational
creatures
instruct
us
wherefore
we
are
justly
excluded
from
all
excuse
for
our
uncertain
and
extravagant
deviations
since
all
things
conspire
to
show
us
the
right
way
but
however
men
are
chargeable
with
sinfully
corrupting
the
seeds
of
divine
knowledge
which
by
the
wonderful
operation
of
nature
are
sown
in
their
hearts
so
that
they
produce
no
good
and
fair
crop
yet
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
simple
testimony
magnificently
borne
by
the
creatures
to
the
glory
of
god
is
very
insufficient
for
our
instruction
for
as
soon
as
a
survey
of
the
world
has
just
shown
us
a
deity
neglecting
the
true
god
we
set
up
in
his
stead
the
dreams
and
phantasms
of
our
own
brains
and
confer
on
them
the
praise
of
righteousness
wisdom
goodness
and
power
due
to
him
we
either
obscure
his
daily
acts
or
pervert
them
by
an
erroneous
estimate
thereby
depriving
the
acts
themselves
of
their
glory
and
their
author
of
his
deserved
praise
chapter
vi
the
guidance
and
teaching
of
the
scripture
necessary
to
lead
to
the
knowledge
of
god
the
creator
though
the
light
which
presents
itself
to
all
eyes
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
is
more
than
sufficient
to
deprive
the
ingratitude
of
men
of
every
excuse
since
god
in
order
to
involve
all
mankind
in
the
same
guilt
sets
before
them
all
without
exception
an
exhibition
of
his
majesty
delineated
in
the
creatures
we
need
another
and
better
assistance
properly
to
direct
us
to
the
creator
of
the
world
therefore
he
hath
not
unnecessarily
added
the
light
of
his
word
to
make
himself
known
unto
salvation
and
hath
honoured
with
this
privilege
those
whom
he
intended
to
unite
in
a
more
close
and
familiar
connection
with
himself
for
seeing
the
minds
of
all
men
to
be
agitated
with
unstable
dispositions
when
he
had
chosen
the
jews
as
his
peculiar
flock
he
enclosed
them
as
in
a
fold
that
they
might
not
wander
after
the
vanities
of
other
nations
and
it
is
not
without
cause
that
he
preserves
us
in
the
pure
knowledge
of
himself
by
the
same
means
for
otherwise
they
who
seem
comparatively
to
stand
firm
would
soon
fall
for
as
persons
who
are
old
or
whose
eyes
are
by
any
means
become
dim
if
you
show
them
the
most
beautiful
book
though
they
perceive
something
written
but
can
scarcely
read
two
words
together
yet
by
the
assistance
of
spectacles
will
begin
to
read
distinctly
the
scripture
collecting
in
our
minds
the
otherwise
confused
notions
of
deity
dispels
the
darkness
and
gives
us
a
clear
view
of
the
true
god
this
then
is
a
singular
favour
that
in
the
instruction
of
the
church
god
not
only
uses
mute
teachers
but
even
opens
his
own
sacred
mouth
not
only
proclaims
that
some
god
ought
to
be
worshipped
but
at
the
same
time
pronounces
himself
to
be
the
being
to
whom
this
worship
is
due
and
not
only
teaches
the
elect
to
raise
their
view
to
a
deity
but
also
exhibits
himself
as
the
object
of
their
contemplation
this
method
he
hath
observed
toward
his
church
from
the
beginning
beside
those
common
lessons
of
instruction
to
afford
them
also
his
word
which
furnishes
a
more
correct
and
certain
criterion
to
distinguish
him
from
all
fictitious
deities
and
it
was
undoubtedly
by
this
assistance
that
adam
noah
abraham
and
the
rest
of
the
patriarchs
attained
to
that
familiar
knowledge
which
distinguished
them
from
unbelievers
i
speak
not
yet
of
the
peculiar
doctrine
of
faith
which
illuminated
them
into
the
hope
of
eternal
life
for
to
pass
from
death
to
life
they
must
have
known
god
not
only
as
the
creator
but
also
as
the
redeemer
as
they
certainly
obtained
both
from
his
word
for
that
species
of
knowledge
which
related
to
him
as
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
world
in
order
preceded
the
other
to
this
was
afterwards
added
the
other
internal
knowledge
which
alone
vivifies
dead
souls
and
apprehends
god
not
only
as
the
creator
of
the
world
and
as
the
sole
author
and
arbiter
of
all
events
but
also
as
the
redeemer
in
the
person
of
the
mediator
but
being
not
yet
come
to
the
fall
of
man
and
the
corruption
of
nature
i
also
forbear
to
treat
of
the
remedy
let
the
reader
remember
therefore
that
i
am
not
yet
treating
of
that
covenant
by
which
god
adopted
the
children
of
abraham
and
of
that
point
of
doctrine
by
which
believers
have
always
been
particularly
separated
from
the
profane
nations
since
that
is
founded
on
christ
but
am
only
showing
how
we
ought
to
learn
from
the
scripture
that
god
who
created
the
world
may
be
certainly
distinguished
from
the
whole
multitude
of
fictitious
deities
the
series
of
subjects
will
in
due
time
lead
us
to
redemption
but
though
we
shall
adduce
many
testimonies
from
the
new
testament
and
some
also
from
the
law
and
the
prophets
in
which
christ
is
expressly
mentioned
yet
they
will
all
tend
to
prove
that
the
scripture
discovers
god
to
us
as
the
creator
of
the
world
and
declares
what
sentiments
we
should
form
of
him
that
we
may
not
be
seeking
after
a
deity
in
a
labyrinth
of
uncertainty
ii
but
whether
god
revealed
himself
to
the
patriarchs
by
oracles
and
visions
or
suggested
by
means
of
the
ministry
of
men
what
should
be
handed
down
by
tradition
to
their
posterity
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
their
minds
were
impressed
with
a
firm
assurance
of
the
doctrine
so
that
they
were
persuaded
and
convinced
that
the
information
they
had
received
came
from
god
for
god
always
secured
to
his
word
an
undoubted
credit
superior
to
all
human
opinion
at
length
that
the
truth
might
remain
in
the
world
in
a
continual
course
of
instruction
to
all
ages
he
determined
that
the
same
oracles
which
he
had
deposited
with
the
patriarchs
should
be
committed
to
public
records
with
this
design
the
law
was
promulgated
to
which
the
prophets
were
afterwards
annexed
as
its
though
the
uses
of
the
law
were
many
as
will
be
better
seen
in
the
proper
place
and
particularly
the
intention
of
moses
and
of
all
the
prophets
was
to
teach
the
mode
of
reconciliation
between
god
and
man
whence
also
paul
calls
christ
the
end
of
the
law
i
repeat
again
that
beside
the
peculiar
doctrine
of
faith
and
repentance
which
proposes
christ
as
the
mediator
the
scripture
distinguishes
the
only
true
god
by
certain
characters
and
titles
as
the
creator
and
governor
of
the
world
that
he
may
not
be
confounded
with
the
multitude
of
false
gods
therefore
though
every
man
should
seriously
apply
himself
to
a
consideration
of
the
works
of
god
being
placed
in
this
very
splendid
theatre
to
be
a
spectator
of
them
yet
he
ought
principally
to
attend
to
the
word
that
he
may
attain
superior
advantages
and
therefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
who
are
born
in
darkness
grow
more
and
more
hardened
in
their
stupidity
since
very
few
attend
to
the
word
of
god
with
teachable
dispositions
to
restrain
themselves
within
the
limits
which
it
prescribes
but
rather
exult
in
their
own
vanity
this
then
must
be
considered
as
a
fixed
principle
that
in
order
to
enjoy
the
light
of
true
religion
we
ought
to
begin
with
the
doctrine
of
heaven
and
that
no
man
can
have
the
least
knowledge
of
true
and
sound
doctrine
without
having
been
a
disciple
of
the
scripture
hence
originates
all
true
wisdom
when
we
embrace
with
reverence
the
testimony
which
god
hath
been
pleased
therein
to
deliver
concerning
himself
for
obedience
is
the
source
not
only
of
an
absolutely
perfect
and
complete
faith
but
of
all
right
knowledge
of
god
and
truly
in
this
instance
god
hath
in
his
providence
particularly
consulted
the
true
interests
of
mankind
in
all
ages
iii
for
if
we
consider
the
mutability
of
the
human
mind
easy
its
lapse
into
forgetfulness
of
god
how
great
its
propensity
to
errors
of
every
kind
how
violent
its
rage
for
the
perpetual
fabrication
of
new
and
false
religions
will
be
easy
to
perceive
the
necessity
of
the
heavenly
doctrine
being
thus
committed
to
writing
that
it
might
not
be
lost
in
oblivion
or
evaporate
in
error
or
be
corrupted
by
the
presumption
of
men
since
it
is
evident
therefore
that
god
foreseeing
the
inefficacy
of
his
manifestation
of
himself
in
the
exquisite
structure
of
the
world
hath
afforded
the
assistance
of
his
word
to
all
those
to
whom
he
determined
to
make
his
instructions
effectual
we
seriously
aspire
to
a
sincere
contemplation
of
god
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
pursue
this
right
way
we
must
come
i
say
to
the
word
which
contains
a
just
and
lively
description
of
god
as
he
appears
in
his
works
when
those
works
are
estimated
not
according
to
our
depraved
judgment
but
by
the
rule
of
eternal
truth
if
we
deviate
from
it
as
i
have
just
observed
though
we
run
with
the
utmost
celerity
yet
being
out
of
the
course
we
shall
never
reach
the
goal
for
it
must
be
concluded
that
the
light
of
the
divine
countenance
which
even
the
apostle
says
no
man
can
approach
unto
is
like
an
inexplicable
labyrinth
to
us
unless
we
are
directed
by
the
line
of
the
word
so
that
it
were
better
to
halt
in
this
way
than
to
run
with
the
greatest
rapidity
out
of
it
therefore
david
inculcating
the
necessity
of
the
removal
of
superstitions
out
of
the
world
that
pure
religion
may
flourish
frequently
introduces
god
as
reigning
by
the
word
reigning
intending
not
the
power
which
he
possesses
and
which
he
exercises
in
the
universal
government
of
nature
but
the
doctrine
in
which
he
asserts
his
legitimate
sovereignty
because
errors
can
never
be
eradicated
from
the
human
heart
till
the
true
knowledge
of
god
is
implanted
in
it
iv
therefore
the
same
psalmist
having
said
that
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
showeth
his
day
unto
day
uttereth
speech
and
night
unto
night
showeth
knowledge
afterwards
proceeds
to
the
mention
of
the
word
the
law
of
the
lord
is
perfect
converting
the
soul
the
testimony
of
the
lord
is
sure
making
wise
the
simple
the
statutes
of
the
lord
are
right
rejoicing
the
heart
the
commandment
of
the
lord
is
pure
enlightening
the
for
though
he
also
comprehends
other
uses
of
the
law
yet
he
suggests
in
general
that
since
god
s
invitation
of
all
nations
to
him
by
the
view
of
heaven
and
earth
is
ineffectual
this
is
the
peculiar
school
of
the
children
of
god
the
same
is
adverted
to
in
the
psalm
where
the
psalmist
having
preached
the
terrors
of
the
divine
voice
which
in
thunders
in
winds
in
showers
in
whirlwinds
and
in
tempests
shakes
the
earth
makes
the
mountains
tremble
and
breaks
the
cedars
adds
at
length
towards
the
close
in
his
temple
doth
every
one
speak
of
his
glory
because
unbelievers
are
deaf
to
all
the
voices
of
god
which
resound
in
the
air
so
in
another
psalm
after
describing
the
terrible
waves
of
the
sea
he
concludes
thus
thy
testimonies
are
very
sure
holiness
becometh
thine
house
o
lord
for
hence
also
proceeds
the
observation
of
christ
to
the
samaritan
woman
that
her
nation
and
all
others
worshipped
they
knew
not
what
and
that
the
jews
were
the
only
worshippers
of
the
true
god
for
since
the
human
mind
is
unable
through
its
imbecility
to
attain
any
knowledge
of
god
without
the
assistance
of
his
sacred
word
all
mankind
except
the
jews
as
they
sought
god
without
the
word
must
necessarily
have
been
wandering
in
vanity
and
error
chapter
vii
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
necessary
to
confirm
the
scripture
in
order
to
the
complete
establishment
of
its
authority
the
suspension
of
its
authority
on
the
judgment
of
the
church
an
impious
fiction
before
i
proceed
any
further
it
is
proper
to
introduce
some
remarks
on
the
authority
of
the
scripture
not
only
to
prepare
the
mind
to
regard
it
with
due
reverence
but
also
to
remove
every
doubt
for
when
it
is
admitted
to
be
a
declaration
of
the
word
of
god
no
man
can
be
so
deplorably
presumptuous
unless
he
be
also
destitute
of
common
sense
and
of
the
common
feelings
of
men
as
to
dare
to
derogate
from
the
credit
due
to
the
speaker
but
since
we
are
not
favoured
with
daily
oracles
from
heaven
and
since
it
is
only
in
the
scriptures
that
the
lord
hath
been
pleased
to
preserve
his
truth
in
perpetual
remembrance
it
obtains
the
same
complete
credit
and
authority
with
believers
when
they
are
satisfied
of
its
divine
origin
as
if
they
heard
the
very
words
pronounced
by
god
himself
the
subject
indeed
merits
a
diffuse
discussion
and
a
most
accurate
examination
but
the
reader
will
pardon
me
if
i
attend
rather
to
what
the
design
of
this
work
admits
than
to
what
the
extensive
nature
of
the
present
subject
requires
but
there
has
very
generally
prevailed
a
most
pernicious
error
that
the
scriptures
have
only
so
much
weight
as
is
conceded
to
them
by
the
suffrages
of
the
church
as
though
the
eternal
and
inviolable
truth
of
god
depended
on
the
arbitrary
will
of
men
for
thus
with
great
contempt
of
the
holy
spirit
they
inquire
who
can
assure
us
that
god
is
the
author
of
them
who
can
with
certainty
affirm
that
they
have
been
preserved
safe
and
uncorrupted
to
the
present
age
who
can
persuade
us
that
this
book
ought
to
be
received
with
reverence
and
that
expunged
from
the
sacred
number
unless
all
these
things
were
regulated
by
the
decisions
of
the
church
it
depends
therefore
say
they
on
the
determination
of
the
church
to
decide
both
what
reverence
is
due
to
the
scripture
and
what
books
are
to
be
comprised
in
its
canon
thus
sacrilegious
men
while
they
wish
to
introduce
an
unlimited
tyranny
under
the
name
of
the
church
are
totally
unconcerned
with
what
absurdities
they
embarrass
themselves
and
others
provided
they
can
extort
from
the
ignorant
this
one
admission
that
the
church
can
do
every
thing
but
if
this
be
true
what
will
be
the
condition
of
those
wretched
consciences
which
are
seeking
a
solid
assurance
of
eternal
life
if
all
the
promises
extant
concerning
it
rest
only
on
the
judgment
of
men
will
the
reception
of
such
an
answer
cause
their
fluctuations
to
subside
and
their
terrors
to
vanish
again
how
will
the
impious
ridicule
our
faith
and
all
men
call
it
in
question
if
it
be
understood
to
possess
only
a
precarious
authority
depending
on
the
favour
of
men
ii
but
such
cavillers
are
completely
refuted
even
by
one
word
of
the
apostle
he
testifies
that
the
church
is
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
if
the
doctrine
of
the
prophets
and
apostles
be
the
foundation
of
the
church
it
must
have
been
certain
antecedently
to
the
existence
of
the
church
nor
is
there
any
foundation
for
this
cavil
that
though
the
church
derive
its
origin
from
the
scriptures
yet
it
remains
doubtful
what
writings
are
to
be
ascribed
to
the
prophets
and
apostles
unless
it
be
determined
by
the
church
for
if
the
christian
church
has
been
from
the
beginning
founded
on
the
writings
of
the
prophets
and
the
preaching
of
the
apostles
wherever
that
doctrine
is
found
the
approbation
of
it
has
certainly
preceded
the
formation
of
the
church
since
without
it
the
church
itself
had
never
existed
it
is
a
very
false
notion
therefore
that
the
power
of
judging
of
the
scripture
belongs
to
the
church
so
as
to
make
the
certainty
of
it
dependent
on
the
church
s
will
wherefore
when
the
church
receives
it
and
seals
it
with
her
suffrage
she
does
not
authenticate
a
thing
otherwise
dubious
or
controvertible
but
knowing
it
to
be
the
truth
of
her
god
performs
a
duty
of
piety
by
treating
it
with
immediate
veneration
but
with
regard
to
the
question
how
shall
we
be
persuaded
of
its
divine
original
unless
we
have
recourse
to
the
decree
of
the
church
this
is
just
as
if
any
one
should
inquire
how
shall
we
learn
to
distinguish
light
from
darkness
white
from
black
sweet
from
bitter
for
the
scripture
exhibits
as
clear
evidence
of
its
truth
as
white
and
black
things
do
of
their
colour
or
sweet
and
bitter
things
of
their
taste
iii
i
know
indeed
that
they
commonly
cite
the
opinion
of
augustine
where
he
says
that
he
would
not
believe
the
gospel
unless
he
were
influenced
by
the
authority
of
the
but
how
falsely
and
unfairly
this
is
cited
in
support
of
such
a
notion
it
is
easy
to
discover
from
the
context
he
was
in
that
contending
with
the
manichees
who
wished
to
be
credited
without
any
controversy
when
they
affirmed
the
truth
to
be
on
their
side
but
never
proved
it
now
as
they
made
the
authority
of
the
gospel
a
pretext
in
order
to
establish
the
credit
of
their
manichæus
he
inquires
what
they
would
do
if
they
met
with
a
man
who
did
not
believe
the
gospel
with
what
kind
of
persuasion
they
would
convert
him
to
their
opinion
he
afterwards
adds
indeed
i
would
not
give
credit
to
the
gospel
intending
that
he
himself
when
an
alien
from
the
faith
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
embrace
the
gospel
as
the
certain
truth
of
god
till
he
was
convinced
by
the
authority
of
the
church
and
is
it
surprising
that
any
one
yet
destitute
of
the
knowledge
of
christ
should
pay
a
respect
to
men
augustine
therefore
does
not
there
maintain
that
the
faith
of
the
pious
is
founded
on
the
authority
of
the
church
nor
does
he
mean
that
the
certainty
of
the
gospel
depends
on
it
but
simply
that
unbelievers
would
have
no
assurance
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
that
would
win
them
to
christ
unless
they
were
influenced
by
the
consent
of
the
church
and
a
little
before
he
clearly
confirms
it
in
these
words
when
i
shall
have
commended
my
own
creed
and
derided
yours
what
judgment
think
you
ought
we
to
form
what
conduct
ought
we
to
pursue
but
to
forsake
those
who
invite
us
to
acknowledge
things
that
are
certain
and
afterwards
command
us
to
believe
things
that
are
uncertain
and
to
follow
those
who
invite
us
first
to
believe
what
we
can
not
yet
clearly
see
that
being
strengthened
by
faith
we
may
acquire
an
understanding
of
what
we
believe
our
mind
being
now
internally
strengthened
and
illuminated
not
by
men
but
by
god
himself
these
are
the
express
words
of
augustine
whence
the
inference
is
obvious
to
every
one
that
this
holy
man
did
not
design
to
suspend
our
faith
in
the
scriptures
on
the
arbitrary
decision
of
the
church
but
only
to
show
what
we
all
confess
to
be
true
that
they
who
are
yet
unilluminated
by
the
spirit
of
god
are
by
a
reverence
for
the
church
brought
to
such
a
docility
as
to
submit
to
learn
the
faith
of
christ
from
the
gospel
and
that
thus
the
authority
of
the
church
is
an
introduction
to
prepare
us
for
the
faith
of
the
gospel
for
we
see
that
he
will
have
the
certainty
of
the
pious
to
rest
on
a
very
different
foundation
otherwise
i
do
not
deny
his
frequently
urging
on
the
manichees
the
universal
consent
of
the
church
with
a
view
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
scripture
which
they
rejected
whence
his
rebuke
of
faustus
for
not
submitting
to
the
truth
of
the
gospel
so
founded
so
established
so
gloriously
celebrated
and
delivered
through
certain
successions
from
the
apostolic
but
he
nowhere
insinuates
that
the
authority
which
we
attribute
to
the
scripture
depends
on
the
definitions
or
decrees
of
men
he
only
produces
the
universal
judgment
of
the
church
which
was
very
useful
to
his
argument
and
gave
him
an
advantage
over
his
adversaries
if
any
one
desire
a
fuller
proof
of
this
let
him
read
his
treatise
of
the
advantage
of
believing
where
he
will
find
that
he
recommends
no
other
facility
of
believing
than
such
as
may
afford
us
an
introduction
and
be
a
proper
beginning
of
inquiry
as
he
expresses
himself
yet
that
we
should
not
be
satisfied
with
mere
opinion
but
rest
upon
certain
and
solid
truth
iv
it
must
be
maintained
as
i
have
before
asserted
that
we
are
not
established
in
the
belief
of
the
doctrine
till
we
are
indubitably
persuaded
that
god
is
its
author
the
principal
proof
therefore
of
the
scriptures
is
every
where
derived
from
the
character
of
the
divine
speaker
the
prophets
and
apostles
boast
not
of
their
own
genius
or
any
of
those
talents
which
conciliate
the
faith
of
the
hearers
nor
do
they
insist
on
arguments
from
reason
but
bring
forward
the
sacred
name
of
god
to
compel
the
submission
of
the
whole
world
we
must
now
see
how
it
appears
not
from
probable
supposition
but
from
clear
demonstration
that
this
use
of
the
divine
name
is
neither
rash
nor
fallacious
now
if
we
wish
to
consult
the
true
interest
of
our
consciences
that
they
may
not
be
unstable
and
wavering
the
subjects
of
perpetual
doubt
that
they
may
not
hesitate
at
the
smallest
scruples
persuasion
must
be
sought
from
a
higher
source
than
human
reasons
or
judgments
or
from
the
secret
testimony
of
the
spirit
it
is
true
that
if
we
were
inclined
to
argue
the
point
many
things
might
be
adduced
which
certainly
evince
if
there
be
any
god
in
heaven
that
he
is
the
author
of
the
law
and
the
prophecies
and
the
gospel
even
though
men
of
learning
and
deep
judgment
rise
up
in
opposition
and
exert
and
display
all
the
powers
of
their
minds
in
this
dispute
yet
unless
they
are
wholly
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
this
confession
will
be
extorted
from
them
that
the
scripture
exhibits
the
plainest
evidences
that
it
is
god
who
speaks
in
it
which
manifests
its
doctrine
to
be
divine
and
we
shall
soon
see
that
all
the
books
of
the
sacred
scripture
very
far
excel
all
other
writings
if
we
read
it
with
pure
eyes
and
sound
minds
we
shall
immediately
perceive
the
majesty
of
god
which
will
subdue
our
audacious
contradictions
and
compel
us
to
obey
him
yet
it
is
acting
a
preposterous
part
to
endeavour
to
produce
sound
faith
in
the
scripture
by
disputations
though
indeed
i
am
far
from
excelling
in
peculiar
dexterity
or
eloquence
yet
if
i
were
to
contend
with
the
most
subtle
despisers
of
god
who
are
ambitious
to
display
their
wit
and
their
skill
in
weakening
the
authority
of
scripture
i
trust
i
should
be
able
without
difficulty
to
silence
their
obstreperous
clamour
and
if
it
were
of
any
use
to
attempt
a
refutation
of
their
cavils
i
would
easily
demolish
the
boasts
which
they
mutter
in
secret
corners
but
though
any
one
vindicates
the
sacred
word
of
god
from
the
aspersions
of
men
yet
this
will
not
fix
in
their
hearts
that
assurance
which
is
essential
to
true
piety
religion
appearing
to
profane
men
to
consist
wholly
in
opinion
in
order
that
they
may
not
believe
any
thing
on
foolish
or
slight
grounds
they
wish
and
expect
it
to
be
proved
by
rational
arguments
that
moses
and
the
prophets
spake
by
divine
inspiration
but
i
reply
that
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
is
superior
to
all
reason
for
as
god
alone
is
a
sufficient
witness
of
himself
in
his
own
word
so
also
the
word
will
never
gain
credit
in
the
hearts
of
men
till
it
be
confirmed
by
the
internal
testimony
of
the
spirit
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
the
same
spirit
who
spake
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophets
should
penetrate
into
our
hearts
to
convince
us
that
they
faithfully
delivered
the
oracles
which
were
divinely
intrusted
to
them
and
this
connection
is
very
suitably
expressed
in
these
words
my
spirit
that
is
upon
thee
and
my
word
which
i
have
put
in
thy
mouth
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed
s
seed
for
some
good
men
are
troubled
that
they
are
not
always
prepared
with
clear
proof
to
oppose
the
impious
when
they
murmur
with
impunity
against
the
divine
word
as
though
the
spirit
were
not
therefore
denominated
a
seal
and
an
earnest
for
the
confirmation
of
the
faith
of
the
pious
because
till
he
illuminate
their
minds
they
are
perpetually
fluctuating
amidst
a
multitude
of
doubts
let
it
be
considered
then
as
an
undeniable
truth
that
they
who
have
been
inwardly
taught
by
the
spirit
feel
an
entire
acquiescence
in
the
scripture
and
that
it
is
carrying
with
it
its
own
evidence
and
ought
not
to
be
made
the
subject
of
demonstration
and
arguments
from
reason
but
it
obtains
the
credit
which
it
deserves
with
us
by
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
for
though
it
conciliate
our
reverence
by
its
internal
majesty
it
never
seriously
affects
us
till
it
is
confirmed
by
the
spirit
in
our
hearts
therefore
being
illuminated
by
him
we
now
believe
the
divine
original
of
the
scripture
not
from
our
own
judgment
or
that
of
others
but
we
esteem
the
certainty
that
we
have
received
it
from
god
s
own
mouth
by
the
ministry
of
men
to
be
superior
to
that
of
any
human
judgment
and
equal
to
that
of
an
intuitive
perception
of
god
himself
in
it
we
seek
not
arguments
or
probabilities
to
support
our
judgment
but
submit
our
judgments
and
understandings
as
to
a
thing
concerning
which
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
judge
and
that
not
like
some
persons
who
are
in
the
habit
of
hastily
embracing
what
they
do
not
understand
which
displeases
them
as
soon
as
they
examine
it
but
because
we
feel
the
firmest
conviction
that
we
hold
an
invincible
truth
nor
like
those
unhappy
men
who
surrender
their
minds
captives
to
superstitions
but
because
we
perceive
in
it
the
undoubted
energies
of
the
divine
power
by
which
we
are
attracted
and
inflamed
to
an
understanding
and
voluntary
obedience
but
with
a
vigour
and
efficacy
superior
to
the
power
of
any
human
will
or
knowledge
with
the
greatest
justice
therefore
god
exclaims
by
isaiah
that
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
were
his
witnesses
because
being
taught
by
prophecies
they
were
certain
that
god
had
spoken
without
the
least
fallacy
or
ambiguity
it
is
such
a
persuasion
therefore
as
requires
no
reasons
such
a
knowledge
as
is
supported
by
the
highest
reason
in
which
indeed
the
mind
rests
with
greater
security
and
constancy
than
in
any
reasons
it
is
finally
such
a
sentiment
as
can
not
be
produced
but
by
a
revelation
from
heaven
i
speak
of
nothing
but
what
every
believer
experiences
in
his
heart
except
that
my
language
falls
far
short
of
a
just
explication
of
the
subject
i
pass
over
many
things
at
present
because
this
subject
will
present
itself
for
discussion
again
in
another
place
only
let
it
be
known
here
that
that
alone
is
true
faith
which
the
spirit
of
god
seals
in
our
hearts
and
with
this
one
reason
every
reader
of
modesty
and
docility
will
be
satisfied
isaiah
predicts
that
all
the
children
of
the
renovated
church
shall
be
taught
of
herein
god
deigns
to
confer
a
singular
privilege
on
his
elect
whom
he
distinguishes
from
the
rest
of
mankind
for
what
is
the
beginning
of
true
learning
but
a
prompt
alacrity
to
hear
the
voice
of
god
by
the
mouth
of
moses
he
demands
our
attention
in
these
terms
say
not
in
thine
heart
who
shall
ascend
into
heaven
or
who
shall
descend
into
the
deep
the
word
is
even
in
thy
if
god
hath
determined
that
this
treasury
of
wisdom
shall
be
reserved
for
his
children
it
is
neither
surprising
nor
absurd
that
we
see
so
much
ignorance
and
stupidity
among
the
vulgar
herd
of
mankind
by
this
appellation
i
designate
even
those
of
the
greatest
talents
and
highest
rank
till
they
are
incorporated
into
the
church
moreover
isaiah
observing
that
the
prophetical
doctrine
would
be
incredible
not
only
to
aliens
but
also
to
the
jews
who
wished
to
be
esteemed
members
of
the
family
adds
at
the
same
time
the
the
arm
of
the
lord
will
not
be
revealed
to
all
whenever
therefore
we
are
disturbed
at
the
paucity
of
believers
let
us
on
the
other
hand
remember
that
none
but
those
to
whom
it
was
given
have
any
apprehension
of
the
mysteries
of
god
chapter
viii
rational
proofs
to
establish
the
belief
of
the
scripture
without
this
certainty
better
and
stronger
than
any
human
judgment
in
vain
will
the
authority
of
the
scripture
be
either
defended
by
arguments
or
established
by
the
consent
of
the
church
or
confirmed
by
any
other
supports
since
unless
the
foundation
be
laid
it
remains
in
perpetual
suspense
whilst
on
the
contrary
when
regarding
it
in
a
different
point
of
view
from
common
things
we
have
once
religiously
received
it
in
a
manner
worthy
of
its
excellence
we
shall
then
derive
great
assistance
from
things
which
before
were
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
certainty
of
it
in
our
minds
for
it
is
admirable
to
observe
how
much
it
conduces
to
our
confirmation
attentively
to
study
the
order
and
disposition
of
the
divine
wisdom
dispensed
in
it
the
heavenly
nature
of
its
doctrine
which
never
savours
of
any
thing
terrestrial
the
beautiful
agreement
of
all
the
parts
with
each
other
and
other
similar
characters
adapted
to
conciliate
respect
to
any
writings
but
our
hearts
are
more
strongly
confirmed
when
we
reflect
that
we
are
constrained
to
admire
it
more
by
the
dignity
of
the
subjects
than
by
the
beauties
of
the
language
for
even
this
did
not
happen
without
the
particular
providence
of
god
that
the
sublime
mysteries
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
should
be
communicated
for
the
most
part
in
a
humble
and
contemptible
style
lest
if
they
had
been
illustrated
with
more
of
the
splendour
of
eloquence
the
impious
might
cavil
that
their
triumph
is
only
the
triumph
of
eloquence
now
since
that
uncultivated
and
almost
rude
simplicity
procures
itself
more
reverence
than
all
the
graces
of
rhetoric
what
opinion
can
we
form
but
that
the
force
of
truth
in
the
sacred
scripture
is
too
powerful
to
need
the
assistance
of
verbal
art
justly
therefore
does
the
apostle
argue
that
the
faith
of
the
corinthians
was
founded
not
in
the
wisdom
of
men
but
in
the
power
of
god
because
his
preaching
among
them
was
not
with
enticing
words
of
man
s
wisdom
but
in
demonstration
of
the
spirit
and
of
for
the
truth
is
vindicated
from
every
doubt
when
unassisted
by
foreign
aid
it
is
sufficient
for
its
own
support
but
that
this
is
the
peculiar
property
of
the
scripture
appears
from
the
insufficiency
of
any
human
compositions
however
artificially
polished
to
make
an
equal
impression
on
our
minds
read
demosthenes
or
cicero
read
plato
aristotle
or
any
others
of
that
class
i
grant
that
you
will
be
attracted
delighted
moved
and
enraptured
by
them
in
a
surprising
manner
but
if
after
reading
them
you
turn
to
the
perusal
of
the
sacred
volume
whether
you
are
willing
or
unwilling
it
will
affect
you
so
powerfully
it
will
so
penetrate
your
heart
and
impress
itself
so
strongly
on
your
mind
that
compared
with
its
energetic
influence
the
beauties
of
rhetoricians
and
philosophers
will
almost
entirely
disappear
so
that
it
is
easy
to
perceive
something
divine
in
the
sacred
scriptures
which
far
surpasses
the
highest
attainments
and
ornaments
of
human
industry
ii
i
grant
indeed
that
the
diction
of
some
of
the
prophets
is
neat
and
elegant
and
even
splendid
so
that
they
are
not
inferior
in
eloquence
to
the
heathen
writers
and
by
such
examples
the
holy
spirit
hath
been
pleased
to
show
that
he
was
not
deficient
in
eloquence
though
elsewhere
he
hath
used
a
rude
and
homely
style
but
whether
we
read
david
isaiah
and
others
that
resemble
them
who
have
a
sweet
and
pleasant
flow
of
words
or
amos
the
herdsman
jeremiah
and
zechariah
whose
rougher
language
savours
of
rusticity
majesty
of
the
spirit
which
i
have
mentioned
is
every
where
conspicuous
i
am
not
ignorant
that
satan
in
many
things
imitates
god
in
order
that
by
the
fallacious
resemblance
he
may
more
easily
insinuate
himself
into
the
minds
of
the
simple
and
has
therefore
craftily
disseminated
in
unpolished
and
even
barbarous
language
the
most
impious
errors
by
which
multitudes
have
been
miserably
deceived
and
has
often
used
obsolete
forms
of
speech
as
a
mask
to
conceal
his
impostures
but
the
vanity
and
fraud
of
such
affectation
are
visible
to
all
men
of
moderate
understanding
with
respect
to
the
sacred
scripture
though
presumptuous
men
try
to
cavil
at
various
passages
yet
it
is
evidently
replete
with
sentences
which
are
beyond
the
powers
of
human
conception
let
all
the
prophets
be
examined
not
one
will
be
found
who
has
not
far
surpassed
the
ability
of
men
so
that
those
to
whom
their
doctrine
is
insipid
must
be
accounted
utterly
destitute
of
all
true
taste
iii
this
argument
has
been
copiously
treated
by
other
writers
wherefore
it
may
suffice
at
present
merely
to
hint
at
a
few
things
which
chiefly
relate
to
the
subject
in
a
general
view
beside
what
i
have
already
treated
on
the
antiquity
of
the
scripture
is
of
no
small
weight
for
notwithstanding
the
fabulous
accounts
of
the
greek
writers
concerning
the
egyptian
theology
yet
there
remains
no
monument
of
any
religion
but
what
is
much
lower
than
the
age
of
moses
nor
does
moses
invent
a
new
deity
he
only
makes
a
declaration
of
what
the
israelites
had
through
a
long
series
of
years
received
by
tradition
from
their
forefathers
concerning
the
eternal
god
for
what
does
he
aim
at
but
to
recall
them
to
the
covenant
made
with
abraham
if
he
had
advanced
a
thing
till
then
unheard
of
it
would
not
have
been
received
but
their
liberation
from
the
servitude
in
which
they
were
detained
must
have
been
a
thing
well
known
to
them
all
so
that
the
mention
of
it
immediately
excited
universal
attention
it
is
probable
also
that
they
had
been
informed
of
the
number
of
four
hundred
years
now
we
must
consider
if
moses
who
himself
preceded
all
other
writers
by
such
a
long
distance
of
time
derives
the
tradition
of
his
doctrine
from
so
remote
a
beginning
how
much
the
sacred
scripture
exceeds
in
antiquity
all
other
books
iv
unless
any
would
choose
to
credit
the
egyptians
who
extend
their
antiquity
to
six
thousand
years
before
the
creation
of
the
world
but
since
their
garrulity
has
been
ridiculed
even
by
all
the
profane
writers
i
need
not
trouble
myself
with
refuting
it
josephus
in
his
book
against
appion
cites
from
the
most
ancient
writers
testimonies
worthy
of
being
remembered
whence
we
may
gather
that
the
doctrine
contained
in
the
law
has
according
to
the
consent
of
all
nations
been
renowned
from
the
remotest
ages
although
it
was
neither
read
nor
truly
understood
now
that
the
malicious
might
have
no
room
for
suspicion
nor
even
the
wicked
any
pretence
for
cavilling
god
hath
provided
the
most
excellent
remedies
for
both
these
dangers
when
moses
relates
what
jacob
had
almost
three
hundred
years
before
by
the
spirit
of
inspiration
pronounced
concerning
his
posterity
how
does
he
disgrace
his
own
tribe
he
even
brands
it
in
the
person
of
levi
with
perpetual
infamy
simeon
says
he
and
levi
instruments
of
cruelty
are
in
their
habitations
o
my
soul
come
not
thou
into
their
secret
unto
their
assembly
mine
honour
be
not
thou
he
certainly
might
have
been
silent
on
that
disgraceful
circumstance
not
only
to
spare
his
father
but
also
to
avoid
aspersing
himself
as
well
as
all
his
family
with
part
of
the
same
ignominy
how
can
any
suspicion
be
entertained
of
him
who
voluntarily
publishing
from
the
inspiration
of
the
holy
spirit
that
the
first
of
the
family
from
which
he
was
descended
was
guilty
of
detestable
conduct
neither
consults
his
own
personal
honours
nor
refuses
to
incur
the
resentment
of
his
relations
to
whom
this
must
undoubtedly
have
given
offence
when
he
mentions
also
the
impious
murmurings
of
aaron
his
brother
and
miriam
his
sister
shall
we
say
that
he
spake
according
to
the
dictates
of
the
flesh
or
obeyed
the
command
of
the
holy
spirit
besides
as
he
enjoyed
the
supreme
authority
why
did
he
not
leave
to
his
own
sons
at
least
the
office
of
the
but
place
them
in
the
lowest
station
i
only
hint
at
a
few
things
out
of
many
but
in
the
law
itself
many
arguments
will
every
where
occur
which
challenge
a
full
belief
that
without
controversy
the
legation
of
moses
was
truly
divine
moreover
the
miracles
which
he
relates
and
which
are
so
numerous
and
remarkable
are
so
many
confirmations
of
the
law
which
he
delivered
and
of
the
doctrine
which
he
published
for
that
he
was
carried
up
into
the
mountain
in
a
cloud
that
he
continued
there
forty
days
deprived
of
all
human
intercourse
that
in
the
act
of
proclaiming
the
law
his
face
shone
as
with
the
rays
of
the
sun
that
lightnings
flashed
all
around
that
thunders
and
various
noises
were
heard
through
the
whole
atmosphere
that
a
trumpet
sounded
but
a
trumpet
not
blown
by
human
breath
that
the
entrance
of
the
tabernacle
was
concealed
from
the
view
of
the
people
by
an
intervening
cloud
that
his
authority
was
so
miraculously
vindicated
by
the
horrible
destruction
of
korah
dathan
and
abiram
and
all
their
impious
faction
that
a
rock
smitten
with
a
rod
immediately
emitted
a
river
that
manna
rained
from
heaven
at
his
request
not
all
these
so
many
testimonies
from
heaven
of
his
being
a
true
prophet
if
any
one
object
that
i
assume
as
granted
things
which
are
the
subjects
of
controversy
this
cavil
is
easily
answered
for
as
moses
published
all
these
things
in
an
assembly
of
the
people
what
room
was
there
for
fiction
among
those
who
had
been
of
the
events
is
it
probable
that
he
would
make
his
appearance
in
public
and
accusing
the
people
of
infidelity
contumacy
ingratitude
and
other
crimes
boast
that
his
doctrine
had
been
confirmed
in
their
sight
by
miracles
which
they
had
never
seen
vi
for
this
also
is
worthy
of
being
remarked
that
all
his
accounts
of
miracles
are
connected
with
such
unpleasant
circumstances
as
were
calculated
to
stimulate
all
the
people
if
there
had
been
but
the
smallest
occasion
to
a
public
and
positive
contradiction
whence
it
appears
that
they
were
induced
to
coincide
with
him
only
by
the
ample
conviction
of
their
own
experience
but
since
the
matter
was
too
evident
for
profane
writers
to
take
the
liberty
of
denying
the
performance
of
miracles
by
moses
the
father
of
lies
has
suggested
the
calumny
of
ascribing
them
to
magical
arts
but
by
what
kind
of
conjecture
can
they
pretend
to
charge
him
with
having
been
a
magician
who
had
so
great
an
abhorrence
of
that
superstition
as
to
command
that
he
who
merely
consulted
magicians
and
soothsayers
should
be
stoned
certainly
no
impostor
practises
such
juggling
tricks
who
does
not
make
it
his
study
for
the
sake
of
acquiring
fame
to
astonish
the
minds
of
the
vulgar
but
what
is
the
practice
of
moses
openly
avowing
that
himself
and
his
brother
aaron
are
nothing
but
that
they
only
execute
the
commands
of
god
he
sufficiently
clears
his
character
from
every
unfavourable
aspersion
now
if
the
events
themselves
be
considered
what
incantation
could
cause
manna
to
rain
daily
from
heaven
sufficient
to
support
the
people
and
if
any
one
laid
up
more
than
the
proper
quantity
cause
it
to
putrefy
as
a
punishment
from
god
for
his
unbelief
add
also
the
many
serious
examinations
which
god
permitted
his
servant
to
undergo
so
that
the
clamour
of
the
wicked
can
now
be
of
no
avail
for
as
often
as
this
holy
servant
of
god
was
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
at
one
time
by
proud
and
petulant
insurrections
of
all
the
people
at
another
by
the
secret
conspiracies
of
a
few
was
it
possible
for
him
to
elude
their
inveterate
rage
by
any
arts
of
deception
and
the
event
evidently
proves
that
by
these
circumstances
his
doctrine
was
confirmed
to
all
succeeding
ages
vii
moreover
who
can
deny
that
his
assigning
in
the
person
of
the
patriarch
jacob
the
supreme
power
to
the
tribe
of
judah
proceeded
from
a
spirit
of
prophecy
especially
if
we
consider
the
eventual
accomplishment
of
this
prediction
suppose
moses
to
have
been
the
first
author
of
it
yet
after
he
committed
it
to
writing
there
elapsed
four
hundred
years
in
which
we
have
no
mention
of
the
sceptre
in
the
tribe
of
judah
after
the
inauguration
of
saul
the
regal
power
seemed
to
be
fixed
in
the
tribe
of
benjamin
when
samuel
anointed
david
what
reason
appeared
for
transferring
it
who
would
have
expected
a
king
to
arise
out
of
the
plebeian
family
of
a
herdsman
and
of
seven
brothers
who
would
have
conjectured
that
such
an
honour
was
destined
for
the
youngest
and
by
what
means
did
he
attain
a
hope
of
the
kingdom
who
can
assert
that
this
unction
was
directed
by
human
art
or
industry
or
prudence
and
was
not
rather
a
completion
of
the
prediction
of
heaven
and
in
like
manner
do
not
his
predictions
although
obscure
concerning
the
admission
of
the
gentiles
into
the
covenant
of
god
which
were
accomplished
almost
two
thousand
years
after
clearly
prove
him
to
have
spoken
under
a
divine
inspiration
i
omit
other
predictions
which
so
strongly
savour
of
a
divine
inspiration
that
all
who
have
the
use
of
their
reason
must
perceive
that
it
is
god
who
speaks
in
short
one
song
of
his
is
a
clear
mirror
in
which
god
evidently
appears
viii
but
in
the
other
prophets
this
is
yet
far
more
conspicuous
i
shall
only
select
a
few
examples
for
to
collect
all
would
be
too
laborious
when
in
the
time
of
isaiah
the
kingdom
of
judah
was
in
peace
and
even
when
they
thought
themselves
safe
in
the
alliance
of
the
chaldeans
isaiah
publicly
spake
of
the
destruction
of
the
city
and
the
banishment
of
the
people
now
even
if
to
predict
long
before
things
which
then
seemed
false
but
have
since
appeared
to
be
true
were
not
a
sufficiently
clear
proof
of
a
divine
inspiration
to
whom
but
god
shall
we
ascribe
the
prophecies
which
he
uttered
concerning
their
deliverance
he
mentions
the
name
of
cyrus
by
whom
the
chaldeans
were
to
be
subdued
and
the
people
restored
to
liberty
more
than
a
century
elapsed
after
this
prophecy
before
the
birth
of
cyrus
for
he
was
not
born
till
about
the
hundredth
year
after
the
prophet
s
death
no
man
could
then
divine
that
there
would
be
one
cyrus
who
would
engage
in
a
war
with
the
babylonians
who
would
subjugate
such
a
powerful
monarchy
and
release
the
people
of
israel
from
exile
does
not
this
bare
narration
without
any
ornaments
of
diction
plainly
demonstrate
that
isaiah
delivered
the
undoubted
oracles
of
god
and
not
the
conjectures
of
men
again
when
jeremiah
just
before
the
people
were
carried
away
limited
the
duration
of
their
captivity
to
seventy
years
and
predicted
their
liberation
and
return
must
not
his
tongue
have
been
under
the
direction
of
the
spirit
of
god
what
impudence
must
it
be
to
deny
that
the
authority
of
the
prophets
has
been
confirmed
by
such
proofs
or
that
what
they
themselves
assert
in
order
to
vindicate
the
credit
due
to
their
declarations
has
been
actually
fulfilled
behold
the
former
things
are
come
to
pass
and
new
things
do
i
declare
before
they
spring
forth
i
tell
you
of
i
shall
not
speak
of
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
who
living
in
distant
countries
but
prophesying
at
the
same
time
so
exactly
accord
in
their
declarations
as
though
they
had
mutually
dictated
the
words
to
each
other
what
shall
we
say
of
daniel
has
not
he
prophesied
of
the
events
of
nearly
six
hundred
years
in
such
a
connected
series
as
if
he
were
composing
a
history
of
transactions
already
past
and
universally
known
if
pious
men
properly
consider
these
things
they
will
be
sufficiently
prepared
to
curb
the
petulance
of
the
wicked
for
the
demonstration
is
too
clear
to
be
liable
to
any
cavils
ix
i
know
what
is
objected
by
some
clamorous
men
who
would
ostentatiously
display
the
force
of
their
understanding
in
opposing
divine
truth
for
they
inquire
who
has
assured
us
that
moses
and
the
prophets
actually
wrote
those
books
which
bear
their
names
they
even
dare
to
question
whether
such
a
man
as
moses
ever
existed
but
if
any
man
should
call
in
question
the
existence
of
plato
or
aristotle
or
cicero
who
would
deny
that
such
madness
ought
to
receive
corporal
punishment
the
law
of
moses
has
been
wonderfully
preserved
rather
by
the
providence
of
heaven
than
by
the
endeavours
of
men
and
though
through
the
negligence
of
the
priests
it
lay
for
a
short
time
concealed
since
it
was
found
by
the
pious
king
josiah
it
has
continued
in
the
hands
of
men
through
every
succeeding
age
nor
indeed
did
josiah
produce
it
as
a
thing
unknown
or
new
but
as
what
had
always
been
public
and
the
memory
of
which
was
then
famous
the
protograph
had
been
appointed
to
be
kept
in
the
temple
and
a
transcript
of
it
to
be
deposited
in
the
royal
archives
only
the
priests
had
discontinued
their
ancient
custom
of
publishing
the
law
and
the
people
themselves
had
neglected
their
wonted
reading
of
it
yet
there
scarcely
passed
an
age
in
which
its
sanction
was
not
confirmed
and
renewed
were
they
who
had
the
writings
of
david
ignorant
of
moses
but
to
speak
of
all
at
once
it
is
certain
that
their
writings
descended
to
posterity
only
from
hand
to
hand
so
to
speak
through
a
long
series
of
years
transmitted
from
the
fathers
who
partly
had
heard
them
speak
and
partly
learned
from
others
who
heard
them
while
it
was
fresh
in
their
memory
that
they
had
thus
spoken
x
with
regard
to
what
they
object
from
the
history
of
the
maccabees
to
diminish
the
credit
of
the
scripture
nothing
could
be
conceived
more
adapted
to
establish
it
but
first
let
us
divest
it
of
their
artificial
colouring
and
then
retort
upon
them
the
weapon
which
they
direct
against
us
when
antiochus
say
they
commanded
all
the
books
to
be
burned
whence
proceeded
the
copies
which
we
now
have
i
on
the
contrary
inquire
where
they
could
so
speedily
be
fabricated
for
it
is
evident
that
as
soon
as
the
persecution
subsided
they
immediately
appeared
and
were
without
controversy
acknowledged
as
the
same
by
all
pious
men
who
having
been
educated
in
their
doctrine
had
been
familiarly
acquainted
with
them
nay
even
when
all
the
impious
as
if
by
a
general
conspiracy
so
wantonly
insulted
the
jews
no
man
ever
dared
to
charge
them
with
forging
their
books
for
whatever
be
their
opinion
of
the
jewish
religion
yet
they
confess
that
moses
was
the
author
of
it
what
then
do
these
clamorous
objectors
but
betray
their
own
consummate
impudence
when
they
slander
as
supposititious
books
whose
sacred
antiquity
is
confirmed
by
the
consent
of
all
histories
but
to
waste
no
more
useless
labour
in
refuting
such
stale
calumnies
let
us
rather
consider
how
carefully
the
lord
preserved
his
own
word
when
beyond
all
hope
he
rescued
it
from
the
fury
of
the
most
cruel
of
tyrants
as
from
a
devouring
fire
he
endued
the
pious
priests
and
others
with
so
much
constancy
that
they
hesitated
not
to
redeem
this
treasure
if
necessary
with
their
lives
to
transmit
it
to
posterity
and
that
he
frustrated
the
most
diligent
inquisition
of
so
many
governors
and
soldiers
who
is
there
but
must
acknowledge
it
to
have
been
an
eminent
and
wonderful
work
of
god
that
those
sacred
monuments
which
the
impious
had
flattered
themselves
were
utterly
destroyed
were
soon
public
again
as
it
were
fully
restored
to
mankind
and
indeed
with
far
greater
honour
for
soon
after
followed
the
greek
translation
which
published
them
throughout
the
world
nor
was
god
s
preserving
the
tables
of
his
covenant
from
the
sanguinary
edicts
of
antiochus
the
only
instance
of
his
wonderful
operation
but
that
amidst
such
various
miseries
with
which
the
jewish
nation
was
diminished
and
laid
waste
and
at
last
nearly
exterminated
these
records
still
remained
entire
the
hebrew
language
lay
not
only
despised
but
almost
unknown
and
surely
had
not
god
consulted
the
interest
of
religion
it
had
been
totally
lost
for
how
much
the
jews
after
their
return
from
captivity
departed
from
the
genuine
use
of
their
native
language
appears
from
the
prophets
of
that
age
which
it
is
therefore
useful
to
observe
because
this
comparison
more
clearly
evinces
the
antiquity
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
by
whom
hath
god
preserved
to
us
the
doctrine
of
salvation
contained
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
that
christ
might
be
manifested
in
due
time
by
his
most
inveterate
enemies
the
jews
whom
augustine
therefore
justly
denominates
the
librarians
of
the
christian
church
because
they
have
furnished
us
with
a
book
of
which
themselves
make
no
use
xi
if
we
proceed
to
the
new
testament
by
what
solid
foundations
is
its
truth
supported
three
evangelists
recite
their
history
in
a
low
and
mean
style
many
proud
men
are
disgusted
with
that
simplicity
because
they
attend
not
to
the
principal
points
of
doctrine
whence
it
were
easy
to
infer
that
they
treat
of
heavenly
mysteries
which
are
above
human
capacity
they
who
have
a
spark
of
ingenuous
modesty
will
certainly
be
ashamed
if
they
peruse
the
first
chapter
of
luke
now
the
discourses
of
christ
a
concise
summary
of
which
is
comprised
in
these
three
evangelists
easily
exempt
their
writings
from
contempt
but
john
thundering
from
his
sublimity
more
powerfully
than
any
thunderbolt
levels
to
the
dust
the
obstinacy
of
those
whom
he
does
not
compel
to
the
obedience
of
faith
let
all
those
censorious
critics
whose
supreme
pleasure
consists
in
banishing
all
reverence
for
the
scripture
out
of
their
own
hearts
and
the
hearts
of
others
come
forth
to
public
view
let
them
read
the
gospel
of
john
whether
they
wish
it
or
not
they
will
there
find
numerous
passages
which
at
least
arouse
their
indolence
and
which
will
even
imprint
a
horrible
brand
on
their
consciences
to
restrain
their
ridicule
similar
is
the
method
of
paul
and
of
peter
in
whose
writings
though
the
greater
part
be
blind
yet
their
heavenly
majesty
attracts
universal
attention
but
this
one
circumstance
raises
their
doctrine
sufficiently
above
the
world
that
matthew
who
had
before
been
confined
to
the
profit
of
his
table
and
peter
and
john
who
had
been
employed
in
plain
unlettered
men
learned
nothing
in
any
human
school
which
they
could
communicate
to
others
and
paul
from
not
only
a
professed
but
a
cruel
and
sanguinary
enemy
being
converted
to
a
new
man
proves
by
his
sudden
and
unhoped
for
change
that
he
was
constrained
by
a
command
from
heaven
to
vindicate
that
doctrine
which
he
had
before
opposed
let
these
men
deny
that
the
holy
spirit
descended
on
the
apostles
or
at
least
let
them
dispute
the
credibility
of
the
history
yet
the
fact
itself
loudly
proclaims
that
they
were
taught
by
the
spirit
who
though
before
despised
as
some
of
the
meanest
of
the
people
suddenly
began
to
discourse
in
such
a
magnificent
manner
on
the
mysteries
of
heaven
xii
besides
there
are
also
other
very
substantial
reasons
why
the
consent
of
the
church
should
have
its
weight
for
it
is
not
an
unimportant
consideration
that
since
the
publication
of
the
scripture
so
many
generations
of
men
should
have
agreed
in
voluntarily
obeying
it
and
that
however
satan
together
with
the
whole
world
has
endeavoured
by
strange
methods
to
suppress
or
destroy
it
or
utterly
to
erase
and
obliterate
it
from
the
memory
of
man
yet
it
has
always
like
a
risen
superior
to
all
opposition
and
remained
invincible
indeed
there
has
scarcely
ever
been
a
sophist
or
orator
of
more
than
common
abilities
who
has
not
tried
his
strength
in
opposing
it
yet
they
have
all
availed
nothing
all
the
powers
of
the
earth
have
armed
themselves
for
its
destruction
but
their
attempts
have
all
evaporated
into
smoke
how
could
it
have
so
firmly
resisted
attacks
on
every
quarter
if
it
had
been
supported
only
by
human
power
indeed
an
additional
proof
of
its
divine
origin
arises
from
this
very
circumstance
that
notwithstanding
all
the
strenuous
resistance
of
men
it
has
by
its
own
power
risen
superior
to
every
danger
moreover
not
one
city
or
one
nation
only
has
conspired
to
receive
and
embrace
it
but
as
far
as
the
world
extends
it
has
obtained
its
authority
by
the
holy
consent
of
various
nations
who
agreed
in
nothing
besides
and
as
such
an
agreement
of
minds
so
widely
distant
in
place
and
so
completely
dissimilar
in
manners
and
opinions
ought
to
have
great
influence
with
us
since
it
is
plain
that
it
was
effected
only
by
the
power
of
heaven
so
it
acquires
no
small
weight
from
a
consideration
of
the
piety
of
those
who
unite
in
this
agreement
not
indeed
of
all
but
of
those
who
it
hath
pleased
the
lord
should
shine
as
luminaries
in
his
church
xiii
now
with
what
unlimited
confidence
should
we
submit
to
that
doctrine
which
we
see
confirmed
and
witnessed
by
the
blood
of
so
many
saints
having
once
received
it
they
hesitated
not
with
intrepid
boldness
and
even
with
great
alacrity
to
die
in
its
defence
transmitted
to
us
with
such
a
pledge
how
should
we
not
receive
it
with
a
firm
and
unshaken
conviction
is
it
therefore
no
small
confirmation
of
the
scripture
that
it
has
been
sealed
with
the
blood
of
so
many
martyrs
especially
when
we
consider
that
they
died
to
bear
testimony
to
their
faith
not
through
intemperate
fanaticism
as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
men
of
erroneous
minds
but
through
a
firm
and
constant
yet
sober
zeal
for
god
there
are
other
reasons
and
those
neither
few
nor
weak
by
which
the
native
dignity
and
authority
of
the
scripture
are
not
only
maintained
in
the
minds
of
the
pious
but
also
completely
vindicated
against
the
subtleties
of
calumniators
but
such
as
alone
are
not
sufficient
to
produce
firm
faith
in
it
till
the
heavenly
father
discovering
his
own
power
therein
places
its
authority
beyond
all
controversy
wherefore
the
scripture
will
then
only
be
effectual
to
produce
the
saving
knowledge
of
god
when
the
certainty
of
it
shall
be
founded
on
the
internal
persuasion
of
the
holy
spirit
thus
those
human
testimonies
which
contribute
to
its
confirmation
will
not
be
useless
if
they
follow
that
first
and
principal
proof
as
secondary
aids
to
our
imbecility
but
those
persons
betray
great
folly
who
wish
it
to
be
demonstrated
to
infidels
that
the
scripture
is
the
word
of
god
which
can
not
be
known
without
faith
augustine
therefore
justly
observes
that
piety
and
peace
of
mind
ought
to
precede
in
order
that
a
man
may
understand
somewhat
of
such
great
subjects
chapter
ix
the
fanaticism
which
discards
the
scripture
under
the
pretence
of
resorting
to
immediate
revelations
subversive
of
every
principle
of
piety
persons
who
abandoning
the
scripture
imagine
to
themselves
some
other
way
of
approaching
to
god
must
be
considered
as
not
so
much
misled
by
error
as
actuated
by
frenzy
for
there
have
lately
arisen
some
unsteady
men
who
haughtily
pretending
to
be
taught
by
the
spirit
reject
all
reading
themselves
and
deride
the
simplicity
of
those
who
still
attend
to
what
they
style
the
dead
and
killing
letter
but
i
would
ask
them
what
spirit
that
is
by
whose
inspiration
they
are
elevated
to
such
a
sublimity
as
to
dare
to
despise
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
as
puerile
and
mean
for
if
they
answer
that
it
is
the
spirit
of
christ
how
ridiculous
is
such
an
assurance
for
that
the
apostles
of
christ
and
other
believers
in
the
primitive
church
were
illuminated
by
no
other
spirit
i
think
they
will
concede
but
not
one
of
them
learned
from
his
teaching
to
contemn
the
divine
word
they
were
rather
filled
with
higher
reverence
for
it
as
their
writings
abundantly
testify
this
had
been
predicted
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
for
where
he
says
my
spirit
that
is
upon
thee
and
my
words
which
i
have
put
in
thy
mouth
shall
not
depart
out
of
thy
mouth
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
thy
seed
for
ever
he
does
not
confine
people
under
the
old
dispensation
to
the
external
letter
as
though
they
were
children
learning
to
read
but
declares
that
it
will
be
the
true
and
complete
felicity
of
the
new
church
under
the
reign
of
christ
to
be
governed
by
the
word
of
god
as
well
as
by
his
spirit
whence
we
infer
that
these
persons
are
guilty
of
detestable
sacrilege
in
disjoining
these
two
things
which
the
prophet
has
connected
in
an
inviolable
union
again
paul
after
he
had
been
caught
up
into
the
third
heaven
did
not
cease
to
study
the
doctrine
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
as
he
also
exhorted
timothy
a
teacher
of
more
than
common
excellence
to
give
attendance
to
and
worthy
of
remembrance
is
his
eulogium
on
the
scripture
that
it
is
profitable
for
doctrine
for
reproof
for
correction
for
instruction
in
righteousness
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
how
diabolical
then
is
that
madness
which
pretends
that
the
use
of
the
scripture
is
only
transient
and
temporary
which
guides
the
sons
of
god
to
the
highest
point
of
perfection
i
would
also
ask
them
another
they
have
imbibed
a
different
spirit
from
that
which
the
lord
promised
to
his
disciples
great
as
their
infatuation
is
i
do
not
think
them
fanatical
enough
to
hazard
such
an
avowal
but
what
kind
of
spirit
did
he
promise
one
truly
who
should
not
speak
of
himself
but
suggest
and
instil
into
their
minds
those
things
which
he
had
orally
delivered
the
office
of
the
spirit
then
which
is
promised
to
us
is
not
to
feign
new
and
unheard
of
revelations
or
to
coin
a
new
system
of
doctrine
which
would
seduce
us
from
the
received
doctrine
of
the
gospel
but
to
seal
to
our
minds
the
same
doctrine
which
the
gospel
delivers
ii
hence
we
readily
understand
that
it
is
incumbent
on
us
diligently
to
read
and
attend
to
the
scripture
if
we
would
receive
any
advantage
or
satisfaction
from
the
spirit
of
god
thus
also
peter
commends
those
who
studiously
attended
to
the
doctrine
of
the
prophets
which
yet
might
be
supposed
to
have
retired
after
the
light
of
the
gospel
was
risen
but
on
the
contrary
that
if
any
spirit
neglecting
the
wisdom
of
the
word
of
god
obtrude
on
us
another
doctrine
he
ought
justly
to
be
suspected
of
vanity
and
falsehood
for
as
satan
transforms
himself
into
an
angel
of
light
what
authority
will
the
spirit
have
with
us
unless
we
can
distinguish
him
by
the
most
certain
criterion
we
find
him
clearly
designated
indeed
in
the
word
of
the
lord
but
these
unhappy
men
are
fondly
bent
on
delusion
even
to
their
own
destruction
seeking
a
spirit
rather
from
themselves
than
from
him
but
they
plead
that
it
is
unworthy
of
the
spirit
of
god
to
whom
all
things
ought
to
be
subject
to
be
made
subject
to
the
scripture
as
though
it
were
ignominious
to
the
holy
spirit
to
be
every
where
equal
and
uniform
in
all
things
invariably
consistent
with
himself
if
he
were
to
be
conformed
to
the
rules
of
men
or
of
angels
or
of
any
other
beings
i
grant
he
might
then
be
considered
as
degraded
or
even
reduced
to
a
state
of
servitude
but
while
he
is
compared
with
himself
and
considered
in
himself
who
will
assert
that
he
is
thereby
injured
this
is
bringing
him
to
the
test
of
examination
i
confess
it
is
but
it
is
the
way
which
he
has
chosen
for
the
confirmation
of
his
majesty
among
us
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
as
soon
as
he
communicates
himself
to
us
but
lest
the
spirit
of
satan
should
insinuate
himself
under
his
name
he
chooses
to
be
recognized
by
us
from
his
image
which
he
hath
impressed
in
the
scriptures
he
is
the
author
of
the
scriptures
he
can
not
be
mutable
and
inconsistent
with
himself
he
must
therefore
perpetually
remain
such
as
he
has
there
discovered
himself
to
be
this
is
not
disgraceful
to
him
unless
we
esteem
it
honourable
for
him
to
alter
and
degenerate
from
himself
iii
but
their
cavilling
objection
that
we
depend
on
the
letter
that
killeth
shows
that
they
have
not
escaped
the
punishment
due
to
the
despisers
of
the
scripture
for
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
paul
is
there
contending
against
the
false
apostles
who
recommending
the
law
to
the
exclusion
of
christ
were
seducing
the
people
from
the
blessings
of
the
new
covenant
in
which
the
lord
engages
to
engrave
his
law
in
the
minds
of
believers
and
to
inscribe
it
on
their
hearts
the
letter
therefore
is
dead
and
the
law
of
the
lord
slays
the
readers
of
it
where
it
is
separated
from
the
grace
of
christ
and
only
sounds
in
the
ears
without
affecting
the
heart
but
if
it
be
efficaciously
impressed
on
our
hearts
by
the
spirit
it
exhibit
christ
is
the
word
of
life
converting
the
soul
making
wise
the
simple
but
in
the
same
place
the
apostle
also
calls
his
preaching
the
ministration
of
the
spirit
doubtless
intending
that
the
holy
spirit
so
adheres
to
his
own
truth
which
he
hath
expressed
in
the
scriptures
that
he
only
displays
and
exerts
his
power
where
the
word
is
received
with
due
reverence
and
honour
nor
is
this
repugnant
to
what
i
before
asserted
that
the
word
itself
has
not
much
certainty
with
us
unless
when
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
for
the
lord
hath
established
a
kind
of
mutual
connection
between
the
certainty
of
his
word
and
of
his
spirit
so
that
our
minds
are
filled
with
a
solid
reverence
for
the
word
when
by
the
light
of
the
spirit
we
are
enabled
therein
to
behold
the
divine
countenance
and
on
the
other
hand
without
the
least
fear
of
mistake
we
gladly
receive
the
spirit
when
we
recognize
him
in
his
image
that
is
in
the
word
this
is
the
true
state
of
the
case
god
did
not
publish
his
word
to
mankind
for
the
sake
of
momentary
ostentation
with
a
design
to
destroy
or
annul
it
immediately
on
the
advent
of
the
spirit
but
he
afterwards
sent
the
same
spirit
by
whose
agency
he
had
dispensed
his
word
to
complete
his
work
by
an
efficacious
confirmation
of
that
word
in
this
manner
christ
opened
the
understanding
of
his
two
disciples
not
that
rejecting
the
scriptures
they
might
be
wise
enough
of
themselves
but
that
they
might
understand
the
scriptures
so
when
paul
exhorts
the
thessalonians
to
quench
not
the
spirit
he
does
not
lead
them
to
empty
speculations
independent
of
the
word
for
he
immediately
adds
despise
not
prophesyings
clearly
intimating
that
the
light
of
the
spirit
is
extinguished
when
prophecies
fall
into
contempt
what
answer
can
be
given
to
these
things
by
those
proud
fanatics
who
think
themselves
possessed
of
the
only
valuable
illumination
when
securely
neglecting
and
forsaking
the
divine
word
they
with
equal
confidence
and
temerity
greedily
embrace
every
reverie
which
their
distempered
imaginations
may
have
conceived
a
very
different
sobriety
becomes
the
children
of
god
who
while
they
are
sensible
that
exclusively
of
the
spirit
of
god
they
are
utterly
destitute
of
the
light
of
truth
yet
are
not
ignorant
that
the
word
is
the
instrument
by
which
the
lord
dispenses
to
believers
the
illumination
of
his
spirit
for
they
know
no
other
spirit
than
that
who
dwelt
in
and
spake
by
the
apostles
by
whose
oracles
they
are
continually
called
to
the
hearing
of
the
word
chapter
x
all
idolatrous
worship
discountenanced
in
the
scripture
by
its
exclusive
opposition
of
the
true
god
to
all
the
fictitious
deities
of
the
heathen
but
since
we
have
shown
that
the
knowledge
of
god
which
is
otherwise
exhibited
without
obscurity
in
the
structure
of
the
world
and
in
all
the
creatures
is
yet
more
familiarly
and
clearly
unfolded
in
the
word
it
will
be
useful
to
examine
whether
the
representation
which
the
lord
gives
us
of
himself
in
the
scripture
agrees
with
the
portraiture
which
he
had
before
been
pleased
to
delineate
in
his
works
this
is
indeed
an
extensive
subject
if
we
intended
to
dwell
on
a
particular
discussion
of
it
but
i
shall
content
myself
with
suggesting
some
hints
by
which
the
minds
of
the
pious
may
learn
what
ought
to
be
their
principal
objects
of
investigation
in
scripture
concerning
god
and
may
be
directed
to
a
certain
end
in
that
inquiry
i
do
not
yet
allude
to
the
peculiar
covenant
which
distinguished
the
descendants
of
abraham
from
the
rest
of
the
nations
for
in
receiving
by
gratuitous
adoption
those
who
were
his
enemies
into
the
number
of
his
children
god
even
then
manifested
himself
as
a
redeemer
but
we
are
still
treating
of
that
knowledge
which
relates
to
the
creation
of
the
world
without
ascending
to
christ
the
mediator
but
though
it
will
be
useful
soon
to
cite
some
passages
from
the
new
testament
since
that
also
demonstrates
the
power
of
god
in
the
creation
and
his
providence
in
the
conservation
of
the
world
yet
i
wish
the
reader
to
be
apprized
of
the
point
now
intended
to
be
discussed
that
he
may
not
pass
the
limits
which
the
subject
prescribes
at
present
then
let
it
suffice
to
understand
how
god
the
former
of
heaven
and
earth
governs
the
world
which
he
hath
made
both
his
paternal
goodness
and
the
beneficent
inclinations
of
his
will
are
every
where
celebrated
and
examples
are
given
of
his
severity
which
discover
him
to
be
the
righteous
punisher
of
iniquities
especially
where
his
forbearance
produces
no
salutary
effects
upon
the
obstinate
ii
in
some
places
indeed
we
are
favoured
with
more
explicit
descriptions
which
exhibit
to
our
view
an
exact
representation
of
his
genuine
countenance
for
moses
in
the
description
which
he
gives
of
it
certainly
appears
to
have
intended
a
brief
comprehension
of
all
that
it
was
possible
for
men
to
know
concerning
the
lord
the
lord
god
merciful
and
gracious
long
suffering
and
abundant
in
goodness
and
truth
keeping
mercy
for
thousands
forgiving
iniquity
and
transgression
and
sin
and
that
will
by
no
means
clear
the
guilty
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
and
upon
the
children
s
where
we
may
observe
first
the
assertion
of
his
eternity
and
existence
in
that
magnificent
name
which
is
twice
repeated
and
secondly
the
celebration
of
his
attributes
giving
us
a
description
not
of
what
he
is
in
himself
but
of
what
he
is
to
us
that
our
knowledge
of
him
may
consist
rather
in
a
lively
perception
than
in
vain
and
airy
speculation
here
we
find
an
enumeration
of
the
same
perfections
which
as
we
have
remarked
are
illustriously
displayed
both
in
heaven
and
on
goodness
mercy
justice
judgment
and
truth
for
power
is
comprised
in
the
word
elohim
god
the
prophets
distinguish
him
by
the
same
epithets
when
they
intend
a
complete
exhibition
of
his
holy
name
but
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
quoting
many
passages
let
us
content
ourselves
at
present
with
referring
to
one
psalm
which
contains
such
an
accurate
summary
of
all
his
perfections
that
nothing
seems
to
be
omitted
and
yet
it
contains
nothing
but
what
may
be
known
from
a
contemplation
of
the
creatures
thus
by
the
teaching
of
experience
we
perceive
god
to
be
just
what
he
declares
himself
in
his
word
in
jeremiah
where
he
announces
in
what
characters
he
will
be
known
by
us
he
gives
a
description
not
so
full
but
to
the
same
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me
that
i
am
the
lord
which
exercise
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
these
three
things
it
is
certainly
of
the
highest
importance
for
us
to
in
which
alone
consists
all
our
salvation
judgment
which
is
executed
on
the
wicked
every
day
and
awaits
them
in
a
still
heavier
degree
to
eternal
destruction
righteousness
by
which
the
faithful
are
preserved
and
most
graciously
supported
when
you
understand
these
things
the
prophecy
declares
that
you
have
abundant
reason
for
glorying
in
god
nor
is
this
representation
chargeable
with
an
omission
of
his
truth
or
his
power
or
his
holiness
or
his
goodness
for
how
could
we
have
that
knowledge
which
is
here
required
of
his
righteousness
mercy
and
judgment
unless
it
were
supported
by
his
inflexible
veracity
and
how
could
we
believe
that
he
governed
the
world
in
judgment
and
justice
if
we
were
ignorant
of
his
power
and
whence
proceeds
his
mercy
but
from
his
goodness
if
all
his
ways
then
are
mercy
judgment
and
righteousness
holiness
also
must
be
conspicuously
displayed
in
them
moreover
the
knowledge
of
god
which
is
afforded
us
in
the
scriptures
is
designed
for
the
same
end
as
that
which
we
derive
from
the
creatures
it
invites
us
first
to
the
fear
of
god
and
then
to
confidence
in
him
that
we
may
learn
to
honour
him
with
perfect
innocence
of
life
and
sincere
obedience
to
his
will
and
to
place
all
our
dependence
on
his
goodness
iii
but
here
i
intend
to
comprise
a
summary
of
the
general
doctrine
and
first
let
the
reader
observe
that
the
scripture
in
order
to
direct
us
to
the
true
god
expressly
excludes
and
rejects
all
the
gods
of
the
heathen
because
in
almost
all
ages
religion
has
been
generally
corrupted
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
name
of
one
supreme
god
has
been
universally
known
and
celebrated
for
those
who
used
to
worship
a
multitude
of
deities
whenever
they
spake
according
to
the
genuine
sense
of
nature
used
simply
the
name
of
god
in
the
singular
number
as
though
they
were
contented
with
one
god
and
this
was
wisely
remarked
by
justin
martyr
who
for
this
purpose
wrote
a
book
the
monarchy
of
in
which
he
demonstrates
from
numerous
testimonies
that
the
unity
of
god
was
a
principle
universally
impressed
on
the
hearts
of
men
tertullian
also
proves
the
same
point
from
the
common
phraseology
but
since
all
men
without
exception
have
by
their
own
vanity
been
drawn
into
erroneous
notions
and
so
their
understandings
have
become
vain
all
their
natural
perception
of
the
divine
unity
has
only
served
to
render
them
inexcusable
for
even
the
wisest
of
them
evidently
betray
the
vagrant
uncertainty
of
their
minds
when
they
wish
for
some
god
to
assist
them
and
in
their
vows
call
upon
unknown
and
fabulous
deities
besides
in
imagining
the
existence
of
many
natures
in
god
though
they
did
not
entertain
such
absurd
notions
as
the
ignorant
vulgar
concerning
jupiter
mercury
venus
minerva
and
the
rest
they
were
themselves
by
no
means
exempt
from
the
delusions
of
satan
and
as
we
have
already
remarked
whatever
subterfuges
their
ingenuity
has
invented
none
of
the
philosophers
can
exculpate
themselves
from
the
crime
of
revolting
from
god
by
the
corruption
of
his
truth
for
this
reason
habakkuk
after
condemning
all
idols
bids
us
to
seek
the
lord
in
his
holy
temple
that
the
faithful
might
acknowledge
no
other
god
than
jehovah
who
had
revealed
himself
in
his
word
chapter
xi
unlawfulness
of
ascribing
to
god
a
visible
form
all
idolatry
a
defection
from
the
true
god
now
as
the
scripture
in
consideration
of
the
ignorance
and
dulness
of
the
human
understanding
generally
speaks
in
the
plainest
manner
it
intends
to
discriminate
between
the
true
god
and
all
false
gods
it
principally
contrasts
him
with
idols
not
that
it
may
sanction
the
more
ingenious
and
plausible
systems
of
the
philosophers
but
that
it
may
better
detect
the
folly
and
even
madness
of
the
world
in
researches
concerning
god
as
long
as
every
one
adheres
to
his
own
speculations
that
exclusive
definition
therefore
which
every
where
occurs
reduces
to
nothing
whatever
notions
of
the
deity
men
may
form
in
their
own
imaginations
since
god
alone
is
a
sufficient
witness
concerning
himself
in
the
mean
time
since
the
whole
world
has
been
seized
with
such
brutal
stupidity
as
to
be
desirous
of
visible
representations
of
the
deity
and
thus
to
fabricate
gods
of
wood
stone
gold
silver
and
other
inanimate
and
corruptible
materials
we
ought
to
hold
this
as
a
certain
principle
that
whenever
any
image
is
made
as
a
representation
of
god
the
divine
glory
is
corrupted
by
an
impious
falsehood
therefore
god
in
the
law
after
having
asserted
the
glory
of
deity
to
belong
exclusively
to
himself
when
he
intends
to
show
what
worship
he
approves
or
rejects
immediately
adds
thou
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
in
these
words
he
forbids
us
to
attempt
a
representation
of
him
in
any
visible
figure
and
briefly
enumerates
all
the
forms
by
which
superstition
had
already
begun
to
change
his
truth
into
a
lie
for
the
persians
we
know
worshipped
the
sun
and
the
foolish
heathen
made
for
themselves
as
many
gods
as
they
saw
stars
in
the
heavens
there
was
scarcely
an
animal
indeed
which
the
egyptians
did
not
consider
as
an
image
of
god
the
greeks
appeared
wiser
than
the
rest
because
they
worshipped
the
deity
under
the
human
form
but
god
compares
not
idols
with
each
other
as
though
one
were
better
or
worse
than
another
but
rejects
without
a
single
exception
all
statues
pictures
and
other
figures
in
which
idolaters
imagined
that
he
would
be
near
them
ii
this
it
is
easy
to
infer
from
the
reasons
which
he
annexes
to
the
prohibition
first
in
the
writings
of
moses
take
ye
therefore
good
heed
unto
yourselves
for
ye
saw
no
manner
of
similitude
on
the
day
that
the
lord
spake
unto
you
in
horeb
out
of
the
midst
of
the
fire
ye
heard
the
voice
of
the
words
but
saw
no
similitude
lest
ye
corrupt
yourselves
and
make
you
a
graven
image
the
similitude
of
any
figure
we
see
how
expressly
god
opposes
his
voice
to
every
manner
of
similitude
to
show
that
whoever
desires
visible
representations
of
him
is
guilty
of
departing
from
him
it
will
be
sufficient
to
refer
to
one
of
the
prophets
isaiah
who
insists
more
than
all
the
others
on
this
argument
that
the
divine
majesty
is
dishonoured
by
mean
and
absurd
fiction
when
he
that
is
incorporeal
is
likened
to
a
corporeal
form
he
that
is
invisible
to
a
visible
image
he
that
is
a
spirit
to
inanimate
matter
and
he
that
fills
immensity
to
a
log
of
wood
a
small
stone
or
a
lump
of
gold
paul
also
reasons
in
the
same
manner
forasmuch
then
as
we
are
the
offspring
of
god
we
ought
not
to
think
that
the
godhead
is
like
unto
gold
or
silver
or
stone
graven
by
art
and
man
s
whence
it
follows
that
whatever
statues
are
erected
or
images
painted
to
represent
god
they
are
only
displeasing
to
him
as
being
so
many
insults
to
the
divine
majesty
and
why
should
we
wonder
at
the
holy
spirit
thundering
forth
such
oracles
from
heaven
since
he
compels
the
blind
and
wretched
idolaters
to
make
a
similar
confession
on
earth
well
known
is
the
complaint
of
seneca
which
is
cited
by
augustine
they
dedicate
says
he
the
vilest
and
meanest
materials
to
represent
the
sacred
immortal
and
inviolable
gods
and
give
them
some
a
human
form
and
some
a
brutal
one
and
some
a
double
sex
and
different
bodies
and
they
confer
the
name
of
gods
upon
images
which
if
animated
would
be
accounted
hence
it
further
appears
that
the
pretence
set
up
by
the
advocates
for
idols
that
they
were
forbidden
to
the
jews
because
they
were
prone
to
superstition
is
only
a
frivolous
cavil
to
evade
the
force
of
the
argument
as
if
truly
that
were
peculiarly
applicable
to
one
nation
which
god
deduces
from
his
eternal
existence
and
the
invariable
order
of
nature
besides
paul
was
not
addressing
the
jews
but
the
athenians
when
he
refuted
the
error
of
making
any
similitude
of
god
iii
sometimes
indeed
god
hath
discovered
his
presence
by
certain
signs
so
that
he
was
said
to
be
seen
face
to
face
but
all
the
signs
which
he
ever
adopted
were
well
calculated
for
the
instruction
of
men
and
afforded
clear
intimations
of
his
incomprehensible
essence
for
the
cloud
and
the
smoke
and
the
flame
though
they
were
symbols
of
celestial
glory
nevertheless
operated
as
a
restraint
on
the
minds
of
all
to
prevent
their
attempting
to
penetrate
any
further
wherefore
even
moses
to
whom
he
manifested
himself
more
familiarly
than
to
any
other
obtained
not
by
his
prayers
a
sight
of
the
face
of
god
but
received
this
answer
thou
canst
not
see
my
face
for
there
shall
no
man
see
my
face
and
the
holy
spirit
once
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
dove
but
as
he
presently
disappeared
again
who
does
not
perceive
that
by
this
momentary
symbol
the
faithful
are
taught
that
they
should
believe
the
spirit
to
be
invisible
that
being
content
with
his
power
and
grace
they
might
make
no
external
representation
of
him
the
appearances
of
god
in
the
human
form
were
preludes
to
his
future
manifestation
in
christ
therefore
the
jews
were
not
permitted
to
make
this
a
pretext
for
erecting
a
symbol
of
deity
in
the
figure
of
a
man
the
mercy
seat
also
from
which
under
the
law
god
displayed
the
presence
of
his
power
was
so
constructed
as
to
suggest
that
the
best
contemplation
of
the
divine
being
is
when
the
mind
is
transported
beyond
itself
with
admiration
for
the
cherubim
covered
it
with
their
extended
wings
the
veil
was
spread
before
it
and
the
place
itself
was
sufficiently
concealed
by
its
secluded
situation
it
is
manifestly
unreasonable
therefore
to
endeavour
to
defend
images
of
god
and
of
the
saints
by
the
example
of
those
cherubim
for
pray
what
was
signified
by
those
little
images
but
that
images
are
not
calculated
to
represent
the
divine
mysteries
since
they
were
formed
in
such
a
manner
as
by
veiling
the
mercy
seat
with
their
wings
to
prevent
not
only
the
eyes
but
all
the
human
senses
from
prying
into
god
and
so
to
restrain
all
temerity
moreover
the
prophet
describes
the
seraphim
whom
he
saw
in
a
vision
as
having
their
faces
covered
to
signify
that
the
splendour
of
the
divine
glory
is
so
great
that
even
the
angels
themselves
can
not
steadfastly
behold
it
and
the
faint
sparks
of
it
which
shine
in
the
angels
are
concealed
from
our
view
the
cherubim
however
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
are
acknowledged
by
all
persons
of
sound
judgment
to
have
been
peculiar
to
the
old
state
of
tutelage
under
the
legal
dispensation
to
adduce
them
therefore
as
examples
for
the
imitation
of
the
present
age
is
quite
absurd
for
that
puerile
period
as
i
may
call
it
for
which
such
rudiments
were
appointed
is
now
past
and
indeed
it
is
a
shameful
consideration
that
heathen
writers
are
more
expert
interpreters
of
the
divine
law
than
the
papists
juvenal
reproaches
and
ridicules
the
jews
for
worshipping
the
white
clouds
and
deity
of
heaven
this
language
indeed
is
perverse
and
impious
but
in
denying
that
there
was
any
image
of
god
among
them
he
speaks
with
more
truth
than
the
papists
who
idly
pretend
that
there
was
some
visible
figure
of
him
but
as
that
nation
frequently
broke
out
into
idolatry
with
great
and
sudden
impetuosity
resembling
the
violent
ebullition
of
water
from
a
large
spring
hence
let
us
learn
the
strong
propensity
of
the
human
mind
to
idolatry
lest
imputing
to
the
jews
a
crime
common
to
all
we
should
be
fascinated
by
the
allurements
of
sin
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
death
iv
to
the
same
purpose
is
that
passage
the
idols
of
the
heathen
are
silver
and
gold
the
work
of
men
s
hands
for
the
prophet
concludes
from
the
very
materials
that
they
are
no
gods
whose
images
are
made
of
gold
or
of
silver
and
takes
it
for
granted
that
every
conception
we
form
of
the
deity
merely
from
our
own
understandings
is
a
foolish
imagination
he
mentions
gold
and
silver
rather
than
clay
or
stone
that
the
splendour
or
the
value
of
the
materials
may
procure
no
reverence
for
the
idols
but
he
concludes
in
general
that
nothing
is
more
improbable
than
that
gods
should
be
manufactured
from
any
inanimate
matter
at
the
same
time
he
insists
equally
on
another
it
is
presumption
and
madness
in
mortal
men
who
are
every
moment
in
danger
of
losing
the
fleeting
breath
which
they
draw
to
dare
to
confer
upon
idols
the
honour
due
to
god
man
is
constrained
to
confess
that
he
is
a
creature
of
a
day
and
yet
he
will
have
a
piece
of
metal
to
be
worshipped
as
a
god
of
the
deity
of
which
he
is
the
author
for
whence
did
idols
originate
but
in
the
will
of
men
there
is
much
propriety
in
that
sarcasm
of
a
heathen
poet
who
represents
one
of
their
idols
as
saying
formerly
i
was
the
trunk
of
a
wild
a
useless
log
when
the
artificer
after
hesitating
whether
he
would
make
me
a
stool
or
a
deity
at
length
determined
that
i
should
be
a
a
poor
mortal
forsooth
who
is
as
it
were
expiring
almost
every
moment
will
by
his
workmanship
transfer
to
a
dead
stock
the
name
and
honour
of
god
but
as
that
epicurean
in
his
satirical
effusions
has
paid
no
respect
to
any
religion
this
sarcasm
and
others
of
the
same
kind
we
should
be
stung
and
penetrated
by
the
rebuke
which
the
prophet
has
given
to
the
extreme
stupidity
of
those
who
with
the
same
wood
make
a
fire
to
warm
themselves
heat
an
oven
for
baking
bread
roast
or
boil
their
meat
and
fabricate
a
god
before
which
they
prostrate
themselves
to
address
their
humble
supplications
in
another
place
therefore
he
not
only
pronounces
them
transgressors
of
the
law
but
reproaches
them
for
not
having
learned
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth
since
in
reality
there
is
nothing
more
unreasonable
than
the
thought
of
contracting
the
infinite
and
incomprehensible
god
within
the
compass
of
five
feet
and
yet
this
monstrous
abomination
which
is
manifestly
repugnant
to
the
order
of
nature
experience
demonstrates
to
be
natural
to
man
it
must
be
further
observed
that
idols
are
frequently
stigmatized
as
being
the
works
of
men
s
hands
unsanctioned
by
divine
authority
in
order
to
establish
this
principle
that
all
modes
of
worship
which
are
merely
of
human
invention
are
detestable
the
psalmist
aggravates
this
madness
forasmuch
as
men
implore
the
aid
of
dead
and
insensible
things
who
are
imbued
with
understanding
to
know
that
all
things
are
directed
solely
by
the
power
of
god
but
since
the
corruption
of
nature
carries
all
nations
in
general
and
each
individual
in
particular
to
such
an
excess
of
frenzy
the
spirit
at
length
thunders
out
this
direful
imprecation
let
those
that
make
them
be
like
unto
them
and
every
one
that
trusteth
in
let
it
be
observed
that
all
similitudes
are
equally
as
much
forbidden
as
graven
images
which
refutes
the
foolish
subterfuge
of
the
greeks
for
they
think
themselves
quite
safe
if
they
make
no
sculpture
of
deity
while
in
pictures
they
indulge
greater
liberty
than
any
other
nations
but
the
lord
prohibits
every
representation
of
him
whether
made
by
the
statuary
or
by
any
other
artificer
because
all
similitudes
are
criminal
and
insulting
to
the
divine
majesty
i
know
that
it
is
a
very
common
observation
that
images
are
the
books
of
the
illiterate
gregory
said
so
but
very
different
is
the
decision
of
the
spirit
of
god
in
whose
school
had
gregory
been
taught
he
would
never
have
made
such
an
assertion
for
since
jeremiah
pronounces
that
the
stock
is
a
doctrine
of
vanities
since
habakkuk
represents
a
molten
image
as
a
teacher
of
lies
the
general
doctrine
to
be
gathered
from
these
passages
is
that
whatever
men
learn
respecting
god
from
images
is
equally
frivolous
and
false
if
any
one
object
that
the
prophets
only
reprehended
those
who
abuse
images
to
the
impious
purposes
of
superstition
indeed
i
grant
but
affirm
also
what
is
evident
to
every
one
that
they
utterly
condemn
what
is
assumed
by
the
papists
as
an
indubitable
axiom
that
images
are
substitutes
for
books
for
they
contrast
images
with
the
true
god
as
contraries
which
can
never
agree
this
comparison
i
say
is
laid
down
in
those
passages
which
i
have
just
cited
that
since
there
is
only
one
true
god
whom
the
jews
worshipped
there
can
be
no
visible
figures
made
to
serve
as
representations
of
the
divine
being
without
falsehood
and
criminality
and
all
who
seek
the
knowledge
of
god
from
such
figures
are
under
a
miserable
delusion
were
it
not
true
that
all
knowledge
of
god
sought
from
images
is
corrupt
and
fallacious
it
would
not
be
so
uniformly
condemned
by
the
prophets
this
at
least
must
be
granted
to
us
that
when
we
maintain
the
vanity
and
fallaciousness
of
the
attempts
of
men
to
make
visible
representations
of
god
we
do
no
other
than
recite
the
express
declarations
of
the
prophets
vi
read
likewise
what
has
been
written
on
this
subject
by
lactantius
and
eusebius
who
hesitate
not
to
assume
as
a
certainty
that
all
those
whose
images
are
to
be
seen
were
mortal
men
augustine
also
confidently
asserts
the
unlawfulness
not
only
of
worshipping
images
but
even
of
erecting
any
with
reference
to
god
nor
does
he
advance
any
thing
different
from
what
had
many
years
before
been
decreed
by
the
elibertine
council
the
chapter
of
which
is
as
follows
it
hath
been
decreed
that
no
pictures
be
had
in
the
churches
and
that
what
is
worshipped
or
adored
be
not
painted
on
the
but
most
remarkable
is
what
augustine
elsewhere
cites
from
varro
and
to
the
truth
of
which
he
that
they
who
first
introduced
images
of
the
gods
removed
fear
and
added
if
this
had
been
a
mere
assertion
of
varro
alone
it
might
have
perhaps
but
little
authority
yet
it
should
justly
fill
us
with
shame
that
a
heathen
groping
as
it
were
in
the
dark
attained
so
much
light
as
to
perceive
that
corporeal
representations
were
unworthy
of
the
divine
majesty
being
calculated
to
diminish
the
fear
of
god
and
to
increase
error
among
mankind
the
fact
itself
demonstrates
this
to
have
been
spoken
with
equal
truth
and
wisdom
but
augustine
having
borrowed
it
from
varro
advances
it
as
his
own
opinion
and
first
he
observes
that
the
most
ancient
errors
concerning
god
in
which
men
were
involved
did
not
originate
from
images
but
were
increased
by
them
as
by
the
superaddition
of
new
materials
he
next
explains
that
the
fear
of
god
is
thereby
diminished
and
even
destroyed
since
the
foolish
ridiculous
and
absurd
fabrication
of
idols
would
easily
bring
his
divinity
into
contempt
of
the
truth
of
this
second
remark
i
sincerely
wish
that
we
had
not
such
proofs
in
our
own
experience
whoever
therefore
desires
to
be
rightly
instructed
he
must
learn
from
some
other
quarter
than
from
images
what
is
to
be
known
concerning
god
vii
if
the
papists
have
any
shame
let
them
no
longer
use
this
subterfuge
that
images
are
the
books
of
the
illiterate
which
is
so
clearly
refuted
by
numerous
testimonies
from
scripture
yet
though
i
should
concede
this
point
to
them
it
would
avail
them
but
little
in
defence
of
their
idols
what
monsters
they
obtrude
in
the
place
of
deity
is
well
known
but
what
they
call
the
pictures
or
statues
of
their
are
they
but
examples
of
the
most
abandoned
luxury
and
obscenity
which
if
any
one
were
desirous
of
imitating
he
would
deserve
corporal
punishment
even
prostitutes
in
brothels
are
to
be
seen
in
more
chaste
and
modest
attire
than
those
images
in
their
temples
which
they
wish
to
be
accounted
images
of
virgins
nor
do
they
clothe
the
martyrs
in
habits
at
all
more
becoming
let
them
adorn
their
idols
then
with
some
small
degree
of
modesty
that
the
pretence
of
their
being
books
of
some
holiness
if
not
less
false
may
be
less
impudent
but
even
then
we
will
reply
that
this
is
not
the
method
to
be
adopted
in
sacred
places
for
the
instruction
of
the
faithful
whom
god
will
have
taught
a
very
different
doctrine
from
any
that
can
be
learned
from
such
insignificant
trifles
he
hath
commanded
one
common
doctrine
to
be
there
proposed
to
all
in
the
preaching
of
his
word
and
in
his
sacred
mysteries
to
which
they
betray
great
inattention
of
mind
who
are
carried
about
by
their
eyes
to
the
contemplation
of
idols
whom
then
do
the
papists
call
illiterate
whose
ignorance
will
suffer
them
to
be
taught
only
by
images
those
truly
whom
the
lord
acknowledges
as
his
disciples
whom
he
honours
with
the
revelation
of
his
heavenly
philosophy
whom
he
will
have
instructed
in
the
healthful
mysteries
of
his
kingdom
i
confess
indeed
as
things
are
now
circumstanced
that
there
are
at
present
not
a
few
who
can
not
bear
to
be
deprived
of
such
books
but
whence
arises
this
stupidity
but
from
being
defrauded
of
that
teaching
which
alone
is
adapted
to
their
instruction
in
fact
those
who
presided
over
the
churches
resigned
to
idols
the
office
of
teaching
for
no
other
reason
but
because
they
were
themselves
dumb
paul
testifies
that
in
the
true
preaching
of
this
gospel
christ
is
evidently
set
forth
and
as
it
were
crucified
before
our
to
what
purpose
then
was
the
erection
of
so
many
crosses
of
wood
and
stone
silver
and
gold
every
where
in
the
temples
if
it
had
been
fully
and
faithfully
inculcated
that
christ
died
that
he
might
bear
our
curse
on
the
cross
expiate
our
sins
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
body
cleanse
us
by
his
blood
and
in
a
word
reconcile
us
to
god
the
father
from
this
simple
declaration
they
might
learn
more
than
from
a
thousand
crosses
of
wood
or
stone
for
perhaps
the
avaricious
fix
their
minds
and
their
eyes
more
tenaciously
on
the
gold
and
silver
crosses
than
on
any
part
of
the
divine
word
viii
respecting
the
origin
of
idols
the
generally
received
opinion
agrees
with
what
is
asserted
in
the
book
of
wisdom
namely
that
the
first
authors
of
them
were
persons
who
paid
this
honour
to
the
dead
from
a
superstitious
reverence
for
their
memory
i
grant
that
this
perverse
custom
was
very
ancient
and
deny
not
that
it
greatly
contributed
to
increase
the
rage
of
mankind
after
idolatry
nevertheless
i
can
not
concede
that
it
was
the
first
cause
of
that
evil
for
it
appears
from
moses
that
idols
were
in
use
long
before
the
introduction
of
that
ostentatious
consecration
of
the
images
of
the
dead
which
is
frequently
mentioned
by
profane
writers
when
he
relates
that
rachel
stole
her
father
s
idols
he
speaks
as
of
a
common
corruption
whence
we
may
infer
that
the
mind
of
man
is
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
a
perpetual
manufactory
of
idols
after
the
deluge
there
was
as
it
were
a
regeneration
of
the
world
but
not
many
years
elapsed
before
men
fabricated
gods
according
to
their
own
fancy
and
it
is
probable
that
while
the
holy
patriarch
was
yet
alive
his
posterity
were
addicted
to
idolatry
so
that
with
the
bitterest
grief
he
might
with
his
own
eyes
behold
the
earth
which
god
had
lately
purged
from
its
corruptions
by
such
a
dreadful
judgment
again
polluted
with
idols
for
terah
and
nachor
before
the
birth
of
abraham
were
worshippers
of
false
gods
as
is
asserted
by
joshua
since
the
posterity
of
shem
so
speedily
degenerated
what
opinion
must
we
entertain
of
the
descendants
of
ham
who
had
already
been
cursed
in
their
father
the
true
state
of
the
case
is
that
the
mind
of
man
being
full
of
pride
and
temerity
dares
to
conceive
of
god
according
to
its
own
standard
and
being
sunk
in
stupidity
and
immersed
in
profound
ignorance
imagines
a
vain
and
ridiculous
phantom
instead
of
god
these
evils
are
followed
by
another
men
attempt
to
express
in
the
work
of
their
hands
such
a
deity
as
they
have
imagined
in
their
minds
the
mind
then
begets
the
idol
and
the
hand
brings
it
forth
the
example
of
the
israelites
proves
this
to
have
been
the
origin
of
idolatry
namely
that
men
believe
not
god
to
be
among
them
unless
he
exhibit
some
external
signs
of
his
presence
as
for
this
moses
they
said
we
wot
not
what
is
become
of
him
make
us
gods
which
shall
go
before
they
knew
indeed
that
there
was
a
god
whose
power
they
had
experienced
in
so
many
miracles
but
they
had
no
confidence
in
his
being
present
with
them
unless
they
could
see
some
corporeal
symbol
of
his
countenance
as
a
testimony
of
their
divine
guide
they
wished
therefore
to
understand
from
the
image
going
before
them
that
god
was
the
leader
of
their
march
daily
experience
teaches
that
the
flesh
is
never
satisfied
till
it
has
obtained
some
image
resembling
itself
in
which
it
may
be
foolishly
gratified
as
an
image
of
god
in
almost
all
ages
from
the
creation
of
the
world
in
obedience
to
this
stupid
propensity
men
have
erected
visible
representations
in
which
they
believed
god
to
be
presented
to
their
carnal
eyes
ix
such
an
invention
is
immediately
attended
with
adoration
for
when
men
supposed
that
they
saw
god
in
images
they
also
worshipped
him
in
them
at
length
both
their
eyes
and
their
minds
being
wholly
confined
to
them
they
began
to
grow
more
stupid
and
to
admire
them
as
though
they
possessed
some
inherent
divinity
now
it
is
plain
that
men
did
not
rush
into
the
worship
of
images
till
they
had
imbibed
some
very
gross
opinion
respecting
them
not
indeed
that
they
believed
them
to
be
gods
but
they
imagined
that
something
of
divinity
resided
in
them
when
you
prostrate
yourself
therefore
in
adoration
of
an
image
whether
you
suppose
it
to
represent
god
or
a
creature
you
are
already
fascinated
with
superstition
for
this
reason
the
lord
hath
prohibited
not
only
the
erection
of
statues
made
as
representations
of
him
but
also
the
consecration
of
any
inscriptions
or
monuments
to
stand
as
objects
of
worship
for
the
same
reason
also
another
point
is
annexed
to
the
precept
in
the
law
concerning
adoration
for
as
soon
as
men
have
made
a
visible
figure
of
god
they
attach
divine
power
to
it
such
is
the
stupidity
of
men
that
they
confine
god
to
any
image
which
they
make
to
represent
him
and
therefore
can
not
but
worship
it
nor
is
it
of
any
importance
whether
they
worship
simply
the
idol
or
god
in
the
idol
it
is
always
idolatry
when
divine
honours
are
paid
to
an
idol
under
any
pretence
whatsoever
and
as
god
will
not
be
worshipped
in
a
superstitious
or
idolatrous
manner
whatever
is
conferred
on
idols
is
taken
from
him
let
this
be
considered
by
those
who
seek
such
miserable
pretexts
for
the
defence
of
that
execrable
idolatry
with
which
for
many
ages
true
religion
has
been
overwhelmed
and
subverted
the
images
they
say
are
not
considered
as
gods
neither
were
the
jews
so
thoughtless
as
not
to
remember
that
it
was
god
by
whose
hand
they
had
been
conducted
out
of
egypt
before
they
made
the
calf
but
when
aaron
said
that
those
were
the
gods
by
whom
they
had
been
liberated
from
egypt
they
boldly
assented
signifying
doubtless
that
they
would
keep
in
remembrance
that
god
himself
was
their
deliverer
while
they
could
see
him
going
before
them
in
the
calf
nor
can
we
believe
the
heathen
to
have
been
so
stupid
as
to
conceive
that
god
was
no
other
than
wood
and
stone
for
they
changed
the
images
at
pleasure
but
always
retained
in
their
minds
the
same
gods
and
there
were
many
images
for
one
god
nor
did
they
imagine
to
themselves
gods
in
proportion
to
the
multitude
of
images
besides
they
daily
consecrated
new
images
but
without
supposing
that
they
made
new
gods
read
the
excuses
which
augustine
says
were
alleged
by
the
idolaters
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
when
they
were
charged
with
idolatry
the
vulgar
replied
that
they
worshipped
not
the
visible
figure
but
the
divinity
that
invisibly
dwelt
in
it
but
they
whose
religion
was
as
he
expresses
himself
more
refined
said
that
they
worshipped
neither
the
image
nor
the
spirit
represented
by
it
but
that
in
the
corporeal
figure
they
beheld
a
sign
of
that
which
they
ought
to
worship
what
is
to
be
inferred
from
this
but
that
all
idolaters
whether
jewish
or
gentile
have
been
guided
by
the
notion
which
i
have
mentioned
not
content
with
a
spiritual
knowledge
of
god
they
thought
that
they
should
receive
more
clear
and
familiar
impressions
of
him
by
means
of
images
after
they
had
once
pleased
themselves
with
such
a
preposterous
representation
of
god
they
ceased
not
from
being
deluded
with
new
fallacies
till
they
imagined
that
god
displayed
his
power
in
images
nevertheless
the
jews
were
persuaded
that
under
such
images
they
worshipped
the
eternal
god
the
one
true
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
and
the
heathen
that
they
worshipped
their
false
gods
whom
they
pretended
to
be
inhabitants
of
heaven
x
those
who
deny
that
this
has
been
done
in
time
past
and
even
within
our
own
remembrance
assert
an
impudent
falsehood
for
why
do
they
prostrate
themselves
before
images
and
when
about
to
pray
why
do
they
turn
themselves
towards
them
as
towards
the
ears
of
god
for
it
is
true
as
augustine
says
that
no
man
prays
or
worships
thus
looking
on
an
image
who
is
not
impressed
with
an
opinion
that
he
shall
be
heard
by
it
and
a
hope
that
it
will
do
for
him
as
he
why
is
there
so
great
a
difference
between
images
of
the
same
god
that
one
is
passed
by
with
little
or
no
respect
and
another
is
honoured
in
the
most
solemn
manner
why
do
they
fatigue
themselves
with
votive
pilgrimages
in
going
to
see
images
resembling
those
which
they
have
at
home
why
do
they
at
this
day
fight
even
to
slaughter
and
destruction
in
defence
of
them
as
of
their
country
and
religion
so
that
they
could
part
with
the
only
true
god
more
easily
than
with
their
idols
yet
i
am
not
here
enumerating
the
gross
errors
of
the
vulgar
which
are
almost
infinite
and
occupy
nearly
the
hearts
of
all
i
only
relate
what
they
themselves
allege
when
they
are
most
anxious
to
exculpate
themselves
from
idolatry
we
never
say
they
call
them
our
nor
did
the
jews
or
heathen
in
ancient
times
call
them
their
gods
and
yet
the
prophets
in
all
their
writings
were
constantly
accusing
them
of
fornication
with
wood
and
stone
only
on
account
of
such
things
as
are
daily
practised
by
those
who
wish
to
be
thought
christians
that
is
for
worshipping
god
by
corporeal
adoration
before
figures
of
wood
or
stone
xi
i
am
neither
ignorant
nor
desirous
of
concealing
that
they
evade
the
charge
by
a
more
subtle
distinction
which
will
soon
be
noticed
more
at
large
they
pretend
that
the
reverence
which
they
pay
to
images
is
ειδωλοδουλεια
service
of
images
but
deny
that
it
is
ειδωλολατρεια
worship
of
images
for
in
this
manner
they
express
themselves
when
they
maintain
that
the
reverence
which
they
call
may
be
given
to
statues
or
pictures
without
injury
to
god
they
consider
themselves
therefore
liable
to
no
blame
while
they
are
only
the
servants
of
their
idols
and
not
worshippers
of
them
as
though
worship
were
not
rather
inferior
to
service
and
yet
while
they
seek
to
shelter
themselves
under
a
greek
term
they
contradict
themselves
in
the
most
childish
manner
for
since
the
greek
word
λατρευειν
signifies
nothing
else
but
to
worship
what
they
say
is
equivalent
to
a
confession
that
they
adore
their
images
but
without
adoration
nor
can
they
justly
object
that
i
am
trying
to
insnare
them
with
words
they
betray
their
own
ignorance
in
their
endeavours
to
raise
a
mist
before
the
eyes
of
the
simple
but
however
eloquent
they
may
be
they
will
never
be
able
by
their
rhetoric
to
prove
one
and
the
same
thing
to
be
two
different
things
let
them
point
out
i
say
a
difference
in
fact
that
they
may
be
accounted
different
from
ancient
idolaters
for
as
an
adulterer
or
homicide
will
not
escape
the
imputation
of
guilt
by
giving
his
crime
a
new
and
arbitrary
name
so
it
is
absurd
that
these
persons
should
be
exculpated
by
the
subtle
invention
of
a
name
if
they
really
differ
in
no
respect
from
those
idolaters
whom
they
themselves
are
constrained
to
condemn
but
their
case
is
so
far
from
being
different
from
that
of
former
idolaters
that
the
source
of
all
the
evil
is
a
preposterous
emulation
with
which
they
have
rivalled
them
by
exercising
their
minds
in
contriving
and
their
hands
in
forming
visible
symbols
of
the
deity
xii
nevertheless
i
am
not
so
scrupulous
as
to
think
that
no
images
ought
ever
to
be
permitted
but
since
sculpture
and
painting
are
gifts
of
god
i
wish
for
a
pure
and
legitimate
use
of
both
lest
those
things
which
the
lord
hath
conferred
on
us
for
his
glory
and
our
benefit
be
not
only
corrupted
by
preposterous
abuse
but
even
perverted
to
our
ruin
we
think
it
unlawful
to
make
any
visible
figure
as
a
representation
of
god
because
he
hath
himself
forbidden
it
and
it
can
not
be
done
without
detracting
in
some
measure
from
his
glory
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
we
are
singular
in
this
opinion
for
that
all
sound
writers
have
uniformly
reprobated
the
practice
must
be
evident
to
persons
conversant
with
their
works
if
then
it
be
not
lawful
to
make
any
corporeal
representation
of
god
much
less
will
it
be
lawful
to
worship
it
for
god
or
to
worship
god
in
it
we
conclude
therefore
that
nothing
should
be
painted
and
engraved
but
objects
visible
to
our
eyes
the
divine
majesty
which
is
far
above
the
reach
of
human
sight
ought
not
to
be
corrupted
by
unseemly
figures
the
subjects
of
those
arts
consist
partly
of
histories
and
transactions
partly
of
images
and
corporeal
forms
without
reference
to
any
transactions
the
former
are
of
some
use
in
information
or
recollection
the
latter
as
far
as
i
see
can
furnish
nothing
but
amusement
and
yet
it
is
evident
that
almost
all
the
images
which
have
hitherto
been
set
up
in
the
churches
have
been
of
this
latter
description
hence
it
may
be
seen
that
they
were
placed
there
not
with
judgment
and
discrimination
but
from
a
foolish
and
inconsiderate
passion
for
them
i
say
nothing
here
of
the
impropriety
and
indecency
conspicuous
in
most
of
them
and
the
wanton
licentiousness
displayed
in
them
by
the
painters
and
statuaries
at
which
i
have
before
hinted
i
only
assert
that
even
if
they
were
intrinsically
faultless
still
they
would
be
altogether
unavailing
for
the
purposes
of
instruction
xiii
but
passing
over
that
difference
also
let
us
consider
as
we
proceed
whether
it
be
expedient
to
have
any
images
at
all
in
christian
temples
either
descriptive
of
historical
events
or
representative
of
human
forms
in
the
first
place
if
the
authority
of
the
ancient
church
have
any
influence
with
us
let
us
remember
that
for
about
five
hundred
years
while
religion
continued
in
a
more
prosperous
state
and
purer
doctrine
prevailed
the
christian
churches
were
generally
without
images
they
were
then
first
introduced
therefore
to
ornament
the
churches
when
the
purity
of
the
ministry
had
begun
to
degenerate
i
will
not
dispute
what
was
the
reason
which
influenced
the
first
authors
of
them
but
if
you
compare
one
age
with
another
you
will
see
that
they
were
much
declined
from
the
integrity
of
those
who
had
no
images
who
can
suppose
that
those
holy
fathers
would
have
permitted
the
church
to
remain
so
long
destitute
of
what
they
judged
useful
and
salutary
for
it
the
fact
was
that
instead
of
omitting
them
through
ignorance
or
negligence
they
perceived
them
to
be
of
little
or
no
use
but
on
the
contrary
pregnant
with
much
danger
and
therefore
intentionally
and
wisely
rejected
them
this
is
asserted
in
express
terms
by
augustine
when
they
are
fixed
says
he
in
those
places
in
an
honourable
elevation
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
who
are
praying
and
sacrificing
though
they
are
destitute
of
sense
and
life
yet
by
the
very
similitude
of
living
members
and
senses
they
affect
weak
minds
so
that
they
appear
to
them
to
live
and
breathe
and
in
another
place
for
that
representation
of
members
leads
and
as
it
were
constrains
the
mind
which
animates
a
body
to
suppose
that
body
to
be
endued
with
perception
which
it
sees
to
be
very
similar
to
its
own
and
a
little
after
idols
have
more
influence
to
bow
down
an
unhappy
soul
because
they
have
a
mouth
eyes
ears
and
feet
than
to
correct
it
because
they
neither
speak
nor
see
nor
hear
nor
this
indeed
appears
to
be
the
reason
of
john
s
exhortation
to
keep
ourselves
not
only
from
the
worship
of
idols
but
from
idols
themselves
and
we
have
found
it
too
true
that
through
the
horrible
frenzy
which
almost
to
the
total
destruction
of
piety
hath
heretofore
possessed
the
world
as
soon
as
images
are
set
up
in
churches
there
is
as
it
were
a
standard
of
idolatry
erected
for
the
folly
of
mankind
can
not
refrain
from
immediately
falling
into
idolatrous
worship
but
even
if
the
danger
were
less
yet
when
i
consider
the
use
for
which
temples
were
designed
it
appears
to
me
extremely
unworthy
of
their
sanctity
to
receive
any
other
images
than
those
natural
and
expressive
ones
which
the
lord
hath
consecrated
in
his
word
i
mean
baptism
and
the
supper
of
the
lord
and
the
other
ceremonies
with
which
our
eyes
ought
to
be
more
attentively
engaged
and
more
sensibly
affected
than
to
require
any
others
formed
by
human
ingenuity
behold
the
incomparable
advantages
of
images
the
loss
of
which
if
you
believe
the
papists
nothing
can
compensate
xiv
the
remarks
already
made
on
this
subject
i
think
would
be
sufficient
if
it
were
not
necessary
to
take
some
notice
of
the
council
of
nice
not
that
very
celebrated
one
which
was
convened
by
constantine
the
great
but
that
which
was
held
about
eight
hundred
years
ago
by
the
command
and
under
the
auspices
of
the
empress
irene
for
that
council
decreed
not
only
that
images
should
be
had
in
churches
but
also
that
they
should
be
worshipped
and
notwithstanding
what
i
have
advanced
the
authority
of
the
council
would
raise
a
strong
prejudice
on
the
contrary
side
though
to
confess
the
truth
i
am
not
much
concerned
at
this
as
i
am
to
show
the
reader
their
extreme
madness
whose
fondness
for
images
exceeded
any
thing
that
was
becoming
in
christians
but
let
us
despatch
this
point
first
the
present
advocates
for
the
use
of
images
allege
the
authority
of
that
nicene
council
in
their
defence
there
is
a
book
extant
written
in
refutation
of
this
practice
under
the
name
of
charlemagne
which
from
the
diction
we
may
conclude
was
composed
at
the
same
time
in
this
work
are
recited
the
opinions
of
the
bishops
who
attended
the
council
and
the
arguments
they
used
in
the
controversy
john
the
delegate
of
the
eastern
churches
said
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
and
hence
he
inferred
that
we
ought
to
have
images
the
same
prelate
thought
that
images
were
recommended
to
us
by
this
sentence
show
me
thy
face
for
it
is
another
to
prove
that
they
ought
to
be
placed
on
the
altars
cited
this
testimony
no
man
lighteth
a
candle
and
putteth
it
under
a
another
to
show
the
contemplation
of
these
to
be
useful
to
us
adduced
a
verse
from
a
psalm
the
light
of
thy
countenance
o
lord
is
sealed
upon
another
pressed
this
comparison
into
his
service
as
the
patriarchs
used
the
sacrifices
of
the
heathen
so
christians
ought
to
have
the
images
of
saints
instead
of
the
idols
of
the
in
the
same
manner
they
tortured
that
expression
lord
i
have
loved
the
beauty
of
thy
but
the
most
ingenious
of
all
was
their
interpretation
of
this
passage
as
we
have
heard
so
have
we
seen
that
therefore
god
is
known
not
only
by
the
hearing
of
his
word
but
by
the
contemplation
of
images
similar
is
the
subtlety
of
bishop
theodore
god
is
glorious
in
his
and
in
another
place
it
is
said
in
the
saints
that
are
in
the
earth
therefore
this
ought
to
be
referred
to
images
but
their
impertinencies
and
absurdities
are
so
disgusting
that
i
am
quite
ashamed
to
repeat
them
xv
when
they
dispute
concerning
adoration
they
bring
forward
jacob
s
worshipping
of
pharaoh
and
of
the
staff
of
joseph
and
of
the
inscription
erected
by
himself
although
in
this
last
instance
they
not
only
corrupt
the
sense
of
the
scripture
but
allege
what
is
nowhere
to
be
found
these
passages
also
worship
his
footstool
worship
in
his
holy
hill
and
all
the
rich
of
the
people
shall
supplicate
thy
face
they
consider
as
apposite
and
conclusive
proofs
if
any
one
wished
to
represent
the
advocates
for
images
in
a
ridiculous
point
of
view
could
he
possibly
ascribe
to
them
greater
and
grosser
instances
of
folly
but
that
no
doubt
of
this
might
remain
theodosius
bishop
of
mira
defends
the
propriety
of
worshipping
images
from
the
dreams
of
his
archdeacon
as
seriously
as
if
he
had
an
immediate
revelation
from
heaven
now
let
the
advocates
of
images
go
and
urge
upon
us
the
decree
of
that
council
as
though
those
venerable
fathers
had
not
entirely
destroyed
all
their
credit
by
such
puerile
treatment
of
the
sacred
scriptures
or
such
impious
and
shameful
mutilation
of
them
xvi
i
come
now
to
those
prodigies
of
impiety
which
it
is
wonderful
that
they
ever
ventured
to
broach
and
more
wonderful
still
that
they
have
not
been
opposed
with
universal
detestation
it
is
right
to
expose
this
flagitious
madness
that
the
worship
of
images
may
at
least
be
deprived
of
the
pretence
of
antiquity
which
the
papists
falsely
urge
in
its
favour
theodosius
bishop
of
amorum
denounces
an
anathema
against
all
who
are
averse
to
the
worship
of
images
another
imputes
all
the
calamities
of
greece
and
the
east
to
the
crime
of
not
having
worshipped
them
what
punishments
then
did
the
prophets
apostles
and
martyrs
deserve
in
whose
time
images
were
unknown
they
add
further
if
the
image
of
the
emperor
be
met
by
processions
with
perfumes
and
incense
much
more
is
this
honour
due
to
the
images
of
the
saints
constantius
bishop
of
constance
in
cyprus
professes
his
reverence
for
images
and
avows
that
he
will
pay
them
the
same
worship
and
honour
as
is
due
to
the
trinity
the
source
of
all
life
and
whoever
refuses
to
do
the
same
he
anathematizes
and
dismisses
with
the
manichees
and
marcionites
and
lest
you
should
suppose
this
to
be
the
private
opinion
of
an
individual
they
all
declare
their
assent
to
it
john
the
delegate
of
the
eastern
churches
carried
by
the
fervour
of
his
zeal
to
still
greater
lengths
asserts
it
to
be
better
to
admit
all
the
brothels
of
the
world
into
one
city
than
to
reject
the
worship
of
images
at
length
it
was
unanimously
decreed
that
the
samaritans
were
worse
than
all
heretics
and
that
the
adversaries
of
images
were
worse
than
the
samaritans
but
that
the
farce
might
not
want
its
usual
plaudit
they
add
this
clause
let
them
rejoice
and
exult
who
have
the
image
of
christ
and
offer
sacrifice
to
where
is
now
the
distinction
of
and
with
which
they
attempt
to
deceive
both
god
and
men
for
the
council
gives
the
same
honour
without
any
exception
to
images
and
to
the
living
god
chapter
xii
god
contradistinguished
from
idols
that
he
may
be
solely
and
supremely
worshipped
we
said
at
the
beginning
that
the
knowledge
of
god
consists
not
in
frigid
speculation
but
is
accompanied
by
the
worship
of
him
we
also
cursorily
touched
on
the
right
method
of
worshipping
him
which
will
be
more
fully
explained
in
other
places
i
now
only
repeat
in
few
words
that
whenever
the
scripture
asserts
that
there
is
but
one
god
it
contends
not
for
the
bare
name
but
also
teaches
that
whatever
belongs
to
the
deity
should
not
be
transferred
to
another
this
shows
how
pure
religion
differs
from
idolatry
the
greek
word
ευσεβεια
certainly
signifies
right
worship
since
even
blind
mortals
groping
in
the
dark
have
always
perceived
the
necessity
of
some
certain
rule
that
the
worship
of
god
may
not
be
involved
in
disorder
and
confusion
although
cicero
ingeniously
and
correctly
derives
the
word
from
a
verb
signifying
to
read
over
again
or
to
gather
again
yet
the
reason
he
assigns
for
it
that
good
worshippers
often
recollect
and
diligently
reconsider
what
is
true
is
forced
and
i
rather
think
the
word
is
opposed
to
a
liberty
of
wandering
without
restraint
because
the
greater
part
of
the
world
rashly
embrace
whatever
they
meet
with
and
also
ramble
from
one
thing
to
another
but
piety
in
order
to
walk
with
a
steady
step
collects
itself
within
its
proper
limits
the
word
also
appears
to
me
to
import
a
discontent
with
the
method
and
order
prescribed
and
an
accumulation
of
a
superfluous
mass
of
vain
things
but
to
leave
the
consideration
of
words
it
has
been
generally
admitted
in
all
ages
that
religion
is
corrupted
and
perverted
by
errors
and
falsehoods
whence
we
infer
that
when
we
allow
ourselves
any
thing
from
inconsiderate
zeal
the
pretext
alleged
by
the
superstitious
is
altogether
frivolous
although
this
confession
is
in
the
mouths
of
all
they
betray
at
the
same
time
a
shameful
ignorance
neither
adhering
to
the
one
true
god
nor
observing
any
discrimination
in
his
worship
as
we
have
before
shown
but
god
to
assert
his
own
right
proclaims
that
he
is
jealous
and
will
be
a
severe
avenger
if
men
confound
him
with
any
fictitious
deity
and
then
to
retain
mankind
in
obedience
he
defines
his
legitimate
worship
he
comprises
both
in
his
law
where
he
first
binds
the
faithful
to
himself
as
their
sole
legislator
and
then
prescribes
a
rule
for
the
right
worship
of
him
according
to
his
will
now
of
the
law
since
the
uses
and
ends
of
it
are
various
i
shall
treat
in
its
proper
place
at
present
i
only
remark
that
it
sets
up
a
barrier
to
prevent
men
turning
aside
to
corrupt
modes
of
worship
let
us
remember
what
i
have
already
stated
that
unless
every
thing
belonging
to
divinity
remain
in
god
alone
he
is
spoiled
of
his
honour
and
his
worship
is
violated
and
here
it
is
necessary
to
animadvert
more
particularly
on
the
subtle
fallacies
of
superstition
for
it
revolts
not
to
strange
gods
in
such
a
manner
as
to
appear
to
desert
the
supreme
god
or
to
degrade
him
to
a
level
with
others
but
allowing
him
the
highest
place
it
surrounds
him
with
a
multitude
of
inferior
deities
among
whom
it
distributes
his
honours
and
thus
in
a
cunning
and
hypocritical
manner
the
glory
of
divinity
is
divided
among
many
instead
of
remaining
wholly
in
one
thus
the
ancient
idolaters
jews
as
well
as
gentiles
imagined
one
god
the
father
and
governor
of
all
and
subordinate
to
him
a
vast
multitude
of
other
deities
to
whom
in
common
with
the
supreme
god
they
attributed
the
government
of
heaven
and
earth
thus
the
saints
who
departed
out
of
this
life
some
ages
ago
are
exalted
to
the
society
of
god
to
be
worshipped
and
invoked
and
celebrated
like
him
we
suppose
indeed
the
glory
of
god
not
to
be
sullied
with
this
abomination
whereas
it
is
in
a
great
measure
suppressed
and
extinguished
except
that
we
retain
some
faint
notion
of
his
supreme
power
but
at
the
same
time
deceived
with
such
impostures
we
are
seduced
to
the
worship
of
various
deities
ii
on
this
account
was
invented
the
distinction
of
and
as
they
express
themselves
by
which
they
conceived
they
might
safely
ascribe
divine
honours
to
angels
and
deceased
men
for
it
is
evident
that
the
worship
which
papists
pay
to
the
saints
differs
not
in
reality
from
the
worship
of
god
for
they
adore
god
and
them
promiscuously
but
when
they
are
accused
of
it
they
evade
the
charge
with
this
subterfuge
that
they
preserve
inviolate
to
god
what
belongs
to
him
because
they
leave
him
λατρεια
but
since
the
question
relates
to
a
thing
not
to
a
word
who
can
bear
their
careless
trifling
on
the
most
important
of
all
subjects
but
to
pass
this
also
they
will
gain
nothing
at
last
by
their
distinction
but
that
they
render
worship
to
god
alone
and
service
to
the
saints
for
λατρεια
in
greek
signifies
the
same
as
in
latin
and
in
english
but
δουλεια
properly
signifies
and
yet
in
the
scriptures
this
distinction
is
sometimes
disregarded
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
constant
distinction
it
remains
to
be
inquired
what
is
the
meaning
of
each
term
λατρεια
is
δουλεια
is
now
no
one
doubts
that
to
serve
is
more
than
to
worship
or
honour
for
it
would
be
irksome
to
serve
many
persons
whom
you
would
not
refuse
to
honour
so
unjust
is
the
distribution
to
assign
the
greater
to
the
saints
and
leave
to
god
that
which
is
less
but
many
of
the
ancients
it
is
urged
have
used
this
distinction
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
if
every
one
perceives
it
to
be
not
only
improper
but
altogether
frivolous
iii
leaving
these
subtleties
let
us
consider
the
subject
itself
paul
when
he
reminds
the
galatians
what
they
had
been
before
they
were
illuminated
in
the
knowledge
of
god
says
that
they
did
service
to
them
which
by
nature
were
no
though
he
mentions
not
λατρεια
worship
is
their
idolatry
therefore
excusable
he
certainly
condemns
that
perverse
superstition
which
he
denominates
δουλεια
service
equally
as
much
as
if
he
had
used
the
word
λατρεια
worship
and
when
christ
repels
the
assault
of
satan
with
this
shield
it
is
written
thou
shalt
worship
the
lord
thy
god
the
word
λατρεια
came
not
into
the
question
for
satan
required
nothing
but
προσκυνησις
prostration
or
adoration
so
when
john
is
reprehended
by
an
angel
for
having
fallen
on
his
knees
before
him
we
must
not
understand
that
john
was
so
stupid
as
to
intend
to
transfer
to
an
angel
the
honour
due
exclusively
to
god
but
since
all
worship
that
is
connected
with
religion
can
not
but
savour
of
divine
he
could
not
προσκυνειν
prostrate
himself
before
the
angel
without
detracting
from
the
glory
of
god
we
read
indeed
frequently
of
men
having
been
worshipped
but
that
was
civil
honour
so
to
speak
religion
has
a
different
design
and
no
sooner
is
religion
connected
with
worship
or
homage
than
it
produces
a
profanation
of
the
divine
honour
we
may
see
the
same
in
cornelius
who
had
not
made
such
a
small
progress
in
piety
as
not
to
ascribe
supreme
worship
to
god
alone
when
he
fell
down
before
peter
therefore
it
certainly
was
not
with
an
intention
of
worshipping
him
instead
of
god
yet
peter
positively
forbade
him
to
do
it
and
why
was
this
but
because
men
never
so
particularly
distinguish
between
the
worship
or
homage
of
god
and
that
of
the
creatures
as
to
avoid
transferring
to
a
creature
what
belongs
exclusively
to
god
wherefore
if
we
desire
to
have
but
one
god
let
us
remember
that
his
glory
ought
not
in
the
least
to
be
diminished
but
that
he
must
retain
all
that
belongs
to
him
therefore
zechariah
when
speaking
of
the
restoration
of
the
church
expressly
declares
not
only
that
there
shall
be
one
lord
but
also
that
his
name
shall
be
one
signifying
without
doubt
that
he
will
have
nothing
in
common
with
idols
now
what
kind
of
worship
god
requires
will
be
seen
in
due
course
in
another
place
for
he
hath
been
pleased
in
his
law
to
prescribe
to
mankind
what
is
lawful
and
right
and
so
to
confine
them
to
a
certain
rule
that
every
individual
might
not
take
the
liberty
of
inventing
a
mode
of
worship
according
to
his
own
fancy
but
since
it
is
not
proper
to
burden
the
reader
by
confounding
many
subjects
together
i
shall
not
enter
on
that
point
yet
let
it
suffice
to
know
that
no
religious
services
can
be
transferred
to
any
other
than
god
alone
without
committing
sacrilege
at
first
indeed
superstition
ascribed
divine
honours
either
to
the
sun
or
to
the
other
stars
or
to
idols
afterwards
followed
ambition
which
adorning
men
with
the
spoils
of
god
dared
to
profane
every
thing
that
was
sacred
and
although
there
remained
a
persuasion
that
they
ought
to
worship
a
supreme
god
yet
it
became
customary
to
offer
sacrifices
promiscuously
to
genii
and
inferior
deities
and
deceased
heroes
so
steep
is
the
descent
to
this
vice
to
communicate
to
a
vast
multitude
that
which
god
particularly
challenges
to
himself
alone
chapter
xiii
one
divine
essence
containing
three
persons
taught
in
the
scriptures
from
the
beginning
what
is
taught
in
the
scriptures
concerning
the
immensity
and
spirituality
of
the
essence
of
god
should
serve
not
only
to
overthrow
the
foolish
notions
of
the
vulgar
but
also
to
refute
the
subtleties
of
profane
philosophy
one
of
the
ancients
in
his
own
conception
very
shrewdly
said
that
whatever
we
see
and
whatever
we
do
not
see
is
god
but
he
imagined
that
the
deity
was
diffused
through
every
part
of
the
world
but
although
god
to
keep
us
within
the
bounds
of
sobriety
speaks
but
rarely
of
his
essence
yet
by
those
two
attributes
which
i
have
mentioned
he
supersedes
all
gross
imaginations
and
represses
the
presumption
of
the
human
mind
for
surely
his
immensity
ought
to
inspire
us
with
awe
that
we
may
not
attempt
to
measure
him
with
our
senses
and
the
spirituality
of
his
nature
prohibits
us
from
entertaining
any
earthly
or
carnal
speculations
concerning
him
for
the
same
reason
he
represents
his
residence
to
be
in
heaven
for
though
as
he
is
incomprehensible
he
fills
the
earth
also
yet
seeing
that
our
minds
from
their
dulness
are
continually
dwelling
on
the
earth
in
order
to
shake
off
our
sloth
and
inactivity
he
properly
raises
us
above
the
world
and
here
is
demolished
the
error
of
the
manichees
who
by
maintaining
the
existence
of
two
original
principles
made
the
devil
as
it
were
equal
to
god
this
certainly
was
both
dividing
the
unity
of
god
and
limiting
his
immensity
for
their
daring
to
abuse
certain
testimonies
of
scripture
betrayed
a
shameful
ignorance
as
the
error
itself
evidenced
an
execrable
madness
the
anthropomorphites
also
who
imagined
god
to
be
corporeal
because
the
scripture
frequently
ascribes
to
him
a
mouth
ears
eyes
hands
and
feet
are
easily
refuted
for
who
even
of
the
meanest
capacity
understands
not
that
god
lisps
as
it
were
with
us
just
as
nurses
are
accustomed
to
speak
to
infants
wherefore
such
forms
of
expression
do
not
clearly
explain
the
nature
of
god
but
accommodate
the
knowledge
of
him
to
our
narrow
capacity
to
accomplish
which
the
scripture
must
necessarily
descend
far
below
the
height
of
his
majesty
ii
but
he
also
designates
himself
by
another
peculiar
character
by
which
he
may
be
yet
more
clearly
distinguished
for
while
he
declares
himself
to
be
but
one
he
proposes
himself
to
be
distinctly
considered
in
three
persons
without
apprehending
which
we
have
only
a
bare
and
empty
name
of
god
floating
in
our
brains
without
any
idea
of
the
true
god
now
that
no
one
may
vainly
dream
of
three
gods
or
suppose
that
the
simple
essence
of
god
is
divided
among
the
three
persons
we
must
seek
for
a
short
and
easy
definition
which
will
preserve
us
from
all
error
but
since
some
violently
object
to
the
word
person
as
of
human
invention
we
must
first
examine
the
reasonableness
of
this
objection
when
the
apostle
denominates
the
son
the
express
image
of
the
hypostasis
of
the
father
he
undoubtedly
ascribes
to
the
father
some
subsistence
in
which
he
differs
from
the
son
for
to
understand
this
word
as
synonymous
with
essence
as
some
interpreters
have
done
as
though
christ
like
wax
impressed
with
a
seal
represented
in
himself
the
substance
of
the
father
were
not
only
harsh
but
also
absurd
for
the
essence
of
god
being
simple
and
indivisible
he
who
contains
all
in
himself
not
in
part
or
by
derivation
but
in
complete
perfection
could
not
without
impropriety
and
even
absurdity
be
called
the
express
image
of
it
but
since
the
father
although
distinguished
by
his
own
peculiar
property
hath
expressed
himself
entirely
in
his
son
it
is
with
the
greatest
reason
asserted
that
he
hath
made
his
hypostasis
conspicuous
in
him
with
which
the
other
appellation
given
him
in
the
same
passage
of
the
brightness
of
his
glory
exactly
corresponds
from
the
words
of
the
apostle
we
certainly
conclude
that
there
is
in
the
father
a
proper
hypostasis
which
is
conspicuous
in
the
son
and
thence
also
we
easily
infer
the
hypostasis
of
the
son
which
distinguishes
him
from
the
father
the
same
reasoning
is
applicable
to
the
holy
spirit
for
we
shall
soon
prove
him
also
to
be
god
and
yet
he
must
of
necessity
be
considered
as
distinct
from
the
father
but
this
is
not
a
distinction
of
the
essence
which
it
is
unlawful
to
represent
as
any
other
than
simple
and
undivided
it
follows
therefore
if
the
testimony
of
the
apostle
be
credited
that
there
are
in
god
three
and
as
the
latins
have
expressed
the
same
thing
by
the
word
it
is
too
fastidious
and
obstinate
to
contend
about
so
clear
a
matter
if
we
wish
to
translate
word
for
word
we
may
call
it
many
in
the
same
sense
have
called
it
nor
has
the
word
been
used
by
the
latins
only
but
the
greeks
also
for
the
sake
of
testifying
their
consent
to
this
doctrine
taught
the
existence
of
three
προσωπα
persons
in
god
but
both
greeks
and
latins
notwithstanding
any
verbal
difference
are
in
perfect
harmony
respecting
the
doctrine
itself
iii
now
though
heretics
rail
at
the
word
or
some
morose
and
obstinate
men
clamorously
refuse
to
admit
a
name
of
human
invention
since
they
can
not
make
us
assert
that
there
are
three
each
of
whom
is
entirely
god
nor
yet
that
there
are
more
gods
than
one
how
very
unreasonable
is
it
to
reprobate
words
which
express
nothing
but
what
is
testified
and
recorded
in
the
scriptures
it
were
better
say
they
to
restrain
not
only
our
thoughts
but
our
expressions
also
within
the
limits
of
the
scripture
than
to
introduce
exotic
words
which
may
generate
future
dissensions
and
disputes
for
thus
we
weary
ourselves
with
verbal
controversies
thus
the
truth
is
lost
in
altercation
thus
charity
expires
in
odious
contention
if
they
call
every
word
exotic
which
can
not
be
found
in
the
scriptures
in
so
many
syllables
they
impose
on
us
a
law
which
is
very
unreasonable
and
which
condemns
all
interpretation
but
what
is
composed
of
detached
texts
of
scripture
connected
together
but
if
by
exotic
they
mean
that
which
is
curiously
contrived
and
superstitiously
defended
which
tends
to
contention
more
than
to
edification
the
use
of
which
is
either
unseasonable
or
unprofitable
which
offends
pious
ears
with
its
harshness
and
seduces
persons
from
the
simplicity
of
the
divine
word
i
most
cordially
embrace
their
modest
opinion
for
i
think
that
we
ought
to
speak
of
god
with
the
same
religious
caution
which
should
govern
our
thoughts
of
him
since
all
the
thoughts
that
we
entertain
concerning
him
merely
from
ourselves
are
foolish
and
all
our
expressions
absurd
but
there
is
a
proper
medium
to
be
observed
we
should
seek
in
the
scriptures
a
certain
rule
both
for
thinking
and
for
speaking
by
which
we
may
regulate
all
the
thoughts
of
our
minds
and
all
the
words
of
our
mouths
but
what
forbids
our
expressing
in
plainer
words
those
things
which
in
the
scriptures
are
to
our
understanding
intricate
and
obscure
provided
our
expressions
religiously
and
faithfully
convey
the
true
sense
of
the
scripture
and
are
used
with
modest
caution
and
not
without
sufficient
occasion
of
this
examples
sufficiently
numerous
are
not
wanting
but
when
it
shall
have
been
proved
that
the
church
was
absolutely
necessitated
to
use
the
terms
trinity
and
persons
if
any
one
then
censures
the
novelty
of
the
words
may
he
not
be
justly
considered
as
offended
at
the
light
of
the
truth
as
having
no
other
cause
of
censure
but
that
the
truth
is
explained
and
elucidated
iv
but
such
verbal
novelty
if
it
must
have
this
appellation
is
principally
used
when
the
truth
is
to
be
asserted
in
opposition
to
malicious
cavillers
who
elude
it
by
crafty
evasions
of
which
we
have
too
much
experience
in
the
present
day
who
find
great
difficulty
in
refuting
the
enemies
of
pure
and
sound
doctrine
possessed
of
serpentine
lubricity
they
escape
by
the
most
artful
expedients
unless
they
are
vigorously
pursued
and
held
fast
when
once
caught
thus
the
ancients
pestered
with
various
controversies
against
erroneous
dogmas
were
constrained
to
express
their
sentiments
with
the
utmost
perspicuity
that
they
might
leave
no
subterfuges
to
the
impious
who
availed
themselves
of
obscure
expressions
for
the
concealment
of
their
errors
unable
to
resist
the
clear
testimonies
of
the
scriptures
arius
confessed
christ
to
be
god
and
the
son
of
god
and
as
though
this
were
all
that
was
necessary
he
pretended
to
agree
with
the
church
at
large
but
at
the
same
time
he
continued
to
maintain
that
christ
was
created
and
had
a
beginning
like
other
creatures
to
draw
the
versatile
subtlety
of
this
man
from
its
concealment
the
ancient
fathers
proceeded
further
and
declared
christ
to
be
the
eternal
son
of
the
father
and
consubstantial
with
the
father
here
impiety
openly
discovered
itself
when
the
arians
began
inveterately
to
hate
and
execrate
the
name
ὁμοούσιος
consubstantial
but
if
in
the
first
instance
they
had
sincerely
and
cordially
confessed
christ
to
be
god
they
would
not
have
denied
him
to
be
consubstantial
with
the
father
who
can
dare
to
censure
those
good
men
as
quarrelsome
and
contentious
for
having
kindled
such
a
flame
of
controversy
and
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
church
on
account
of
one
little
word
that
little
word
distinguished
christians
who
held
the
pure
faith
from
sacrilegious
arians
afterwards
arose
sabellius
who
considered
the
names
of
father
son
and
holy
spirit
as
little
more
than
empty
sounds
arguing
that
they
were
not
used
on
account
of
any
real
distinction
but
were
different
attributes
of
god
whose
attributes
of
this
kind
are
numerous
if
the
point
came
to
be
controverted
he
confessed
that
he
believed
the
father
to
be
god
the
son
god
and
the
holy
spirit
god
but
he
would
readily
evade
all
the
force
of
this
confession
by
adding
that
he
had
said
no
other
than
if
he
had
called
god
potent
and
just
and
wise
and
thus
he
came
to
another
conclusion
that
the
father
is
the
son
and
that
the
holy
spirit
is
the
father
without
any
order
or
distinction
the
good
doctors
of
that
age
who
had
the
interest
of
religion
at
heart
in
order
to
counteract
the
wickedness
of
this
man
maintained
on
the
contrary
that
they
ought
really
to
acknowledge
three
peculiar
properties
in
one
god
and
to
defend
themselves
against
his
intricate
subtleties
by
the
plain
and
simple
truth
they
affirmed
that
they
truly
subsisted
in
the
one
god
or
what
is
the
same
that
in
the
unity
of
god
there
subsisted
a
trinity
of
persons
if
then
the
words
have
not
been
rashly
invented
we
should
beware
lest
we
be
convicted
of
fastidious
temerity
in
rejecting
them
i
could
wish
them
indeed
to
be
buried
in
oblivion
provided
this
faith
were
universally
received
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
are
the
one
god
and
that
nevertheless
the
son
is
not
the
father
nor
the
spirit
the
son
but
that
they
are
distinguished
from
each
other
by
some
peculiar
property
i
am
not
so
rigidly
precise
as
to
be
fond
of
contending
for
mere
words
for
i
observe
that
the
ancients
who
otherwise
speak
on
these
subjects
with
great
piety
are
not
consistent
with
each
other
nor
in
all
cases
with
themselves
for
what
forms
of
expression
adopted
by
councils
does
hilary
excuse
to
what
extremes
does
augustine
sometimes
proceed
how
different
are
the
greeks
from
the
latins
but
of
this
variation
let
one
example
suffice
when
the
latins
would
translate
the
word
ὁμοούσιος
they
called
it
signifying
the
of
the
father
and
the
son
to
be
one
and
thus
using
for
whence
also
jerome
writing
to
damasus
pronounces
it
to
be
sacrilege
to
say
that
there
are
three
in
god
yet
that
there
are
three
in
god
you
will
find
asserted
in
hilary
more
than
a
hundred
times
but
how
perplexed
is
jerome
on
the
word
for
he
suspects
some
latent
poison
in
the
assertion
that
there
are
three
in
god
and
if
any
one
uses
this
word
in
a
pious
sense
he
refrains
not
from
calling
it
an
improper
expression
if
indeed
he
was
sincere
in
this
declaration
and
did
not
rather
knowingly
and
wilfully
endeavour
to
asperse
with
a
groundless
calumny
the
bishops
of
the
east
whom
he
hated
he
certainly
discovers
not
much
ingenuousness
in
affirming
that
in
all
the
profane
schools
οὐσία
essence
is
the
same
as
ὑπόστασις
hypostasis
which
the
trite
and
common
use
of
the
words
universally
contradicts
more
modesty
and
liberality
are
discovered
by
augustine
who
though
he
asserts
that
the
word
in
this
sense
is
new
to
latin
ears
yet
leaves
the
greeks
their
usual
phraseology
and
even
peaceably
tolerates
the
latins
who
had
imitated
their
language
and
the
account
of
socrates
in
the
sixth
book
of
his
tripartite
history
seems
to
imply
that
it
was
by
ignorant
men
that
it
had
first
been
improperly
applied
to
this
subject
the
same
hilary
accuses
the
heretics
of
a
great
crime
in
constraining
him
by
their
wickedness
to
expose
to
the
danger
of
human
language
those
things
which
ought
to
be
confined
within
the
religion
of
the
mind
plainly
avowing
that
this
is
to
do
things
unlawful
to
express
things
inexpressible
to
assume
things
not
conceded
a
little
after
he
largely
excuses
himself
for
his
boldness
in
bringing
forward
new
terms
for
when
he
has
used
the
names
of
nature
father
son
and
spirit
he
immediately
adds
that
whatever
is
sought
further
is
beyond
the
signification
of
language
beyond
the
reach
of
our
senses
beyond
the
conception
of
our
understanding
and
in
another
place
he
pronounces
that
happy
were
the
bishops
of
gaul
who
had
neither
composed
nor
received
nor
even
known
any
other
confession
but
that
ancient
and
very
simple
one
which
had
been
received
in
all
the
churches
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
very
similar
is
the
excuse
of
augustine
that
this
word
was
extorted
by
necessity
on
account
of
the
poverty
of
human
language
on
so
great
a
subject
not
for
the
sake
of
expressing
what
god
is
but
to
avoid
passing
it
over
in
total
silence
that
the
father
son
and
spirit
are
three
this
moderation
of
those
holy
men
should
teach
us
not
to
pass
such
severe
censures
on
those
who
are
unwilling
to
subscribe
to
expressions
adopted
by
us
provided
they
are
not
actuated
by
pride
perverseness
or
disingenuous
subtlety
but
let
them
also
on
the
other
hand
consider
the
great
necessity
which
constrains
us
to
use
such
language
that
by
degrees
they
may
at
length
be
accustomed
to
a
useful
phraseology
let
them
also
learn
to
beware
since
we
have
to
oppose
the
arians
on
one
side
and
the
sabellians
on
the
other
lest
while
they
take
offence
at
both
these
parties
being
deprived
of
all
opportunity
of
evasion
they
cause
some
suspicion
that
they
are
themselves
the
disciples
either
of
arius
or
of
sabellius
arius
confesses
that
christ
is
god
but
maintains
also
that
he
was
created
and
had
a
he
acknowledges
that
christ
is
one
with
the
father
but
secretly
whispers
in
the
ears
of
his
disciples
that
he
is
united
to
him
like
the
rest
of
the
faithful
though
by
a
singular
privilege
say
that
he
is
you
tear
off
the
mask
from
the
hypocrite
and
yet
you
add
nothing
to
the
scriptures
sabellius
asserts
that
the
names
father
son
and
spirit
are
expressive
of
no
distinction
in
the
say
that
they
are
three
and
he
will
exclaim
that
you
are
talking
of
three
say
that
in
the
one
essence
of
god
there
is
a
trinity
of
persons
and
you
will
at
once
express
what
the
scriptures
declare
and
will
restrain
such
frivolous
loquacity
now
if
any
persons
are
prevented
by
such
excessive
scrupulousness
from
admitting
these
terms
yet
not
one
of
them
can
deny
that
when
the
scripture
speaks
of
one
god
it
should
be
understood
of
a
unity
of
substance
and
that
when
it
speaks
of
three
in
one
essence
it
denotes
the
persons
in
this
trinity
when
this
is
honestly
confessed
we
have
no
further
concern
about
words
but
i
have
found
by
long
and
frequent
experience
that
those
who
pertinaciously
contend
about
words
cherish
some
latent
poison
so
that
it
were
better
designedly
to
provoke
their
resentment
than
to
use
obscure
language
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
their
favour
vi
but
leaving
the
dispute
about
terms
i
shall
now
enter
on
the
discussion
of
the
subject
itself
what
i
denominate
a
person
is
a
subsistence
in
the
divine
essence
which
is
related
to
the
others
and
yet
distinguished
from
them
by
an
incommunicable
property
by
the
word
we
mean
something
different
from
the
word
for
if
the
were
simply
god
and
had
no
peculiar
property
john
had
been
guilty
of
impropriety
in
saying
that
he
was
always
when
he
immediately
adds
that
also
he
reminds
us
of
the
unity
of
the
essence
but
because
he
could
not
be
without
subsisting
in
the
father
hence
arises
that
subsistence
which
although
inseparably
connected
with
the
essence
has
a
peculiar
mark
by
which
it
is
distinguished
from
it
now
i
say
that
each
of
the
three
subsistences
has
a
relation
to
the
others
but
is
distinguished
from
them
by
a
peculiar
property
we
particularly
use
the
word
or
here
because
when
mention
is
made
simply
and
indefinitely
of
god
this
name
pertains
no
less
to
the
son
and
spirit
than
to
the
father
but
whenever
the
father
is
compared
with
the
son
the
property
peculiar
to
each
distinguishes
him
from
the
other
thirdly
whatever
is
proper
to
each
of
them
i
assert
to
be
incommunicable
because
whatever
is
ascribed
to
the
father
as
a
character
of
distinction
can
not
be
applied
or
transferred
to
the
son
nor
indeed
do
i
disapprove
of
the
definition
of
tertullian
if
rightly
understood
that
there
is
in
god
a
certain
distribution
or
economy
which
makes
no
change
in
the
unity
of
the
vii
but
before
i
proceed
any
further
i
must
prove
the
deity
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
spirit
after
which
we
shall
see
how
they
differ
from
each
other
when
the
scripture
speaks
of
word
of
it
certainly
were
very
absurd
to
imagine
it
to
be
only
a
transient
and
momentary
sound
emitted
into
the
air
and
coming
forth
from
god
himself
of
which
nature
were
the
oracles
given
to
the
fathers
and
all
the
prophecies
it
is
rather
to
be
understood
of
the
eternal
wisdom
residing
in
god
whence
the
oracles
and
all
the
prophecies
proceeded
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
peter
the
ancient
prophets
spake
by
the
spirit
of
christ
no
less
than
the
apostles
and
all
the
succeeding
ministers
of
the
heavenly
doctrine
but
as
christ
had
not
yet
been
manifested
we
must
necessarily
understand
that
the
word
was
begotten
of
the
father
before
the
world
began
and
if
the
spirit
that
inspired
the
prophets
was
the
spirit
of
the
word
we
conclude
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
word
was
truly
god
and
this
is
taught
by
moses
with
sufficient
perspicuity
in
the
creation
of
the
world
in
which
he
represents
the
word
as
acting
such
a
conspicuous
part
for
why
does
he
relate
that
god
in
the
creation
of
each
of
his
works
said
let
this
or
that
be
done
but
that
the
unsearchable
glory
of
god
may
resplendently
appear
in
his
image
captious
and
loquacious
men
would
readily
evade
this
argument
by
saying
that
the
imports
an
order
or
command
but
the
apostles
are
better
interpreters
who
declare
that
the
worlds
were
created
by
the
son
and
that
he
upholds
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
for
here
we
see
that
the
intends
the
nod
or
mandate
of
the
son
who
is
himself
the
eternal
and
essential
son
of
the
father
nor
to
the
wise
and
sober
is
there
any
obscurity
in
that
passage
of
solomon
where
he
introduces
wisdom
as
begotten
of
the
father
before
time
began
and
presiding
at
the
creation
of
the
world
and
over
all
the
works
of
god
for
to
pretend
that
this
denotes
some
temporary
expression
of
the
will
of
god
were
foolish
and
frivolous
whereas
god
then
intended
to
discover
his
fixed
and
eternal
counsel
and
even
something
more
secret
to
the
same
purpose
also
is
that
assertion
of
christ
my
father
worketh
hitherto
and
i
for
by
affirming
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
he
had
continually
coöperated
with
the
father
he
makes
a
more
explicit
declaration
of
what
had
been
briefly
glanced
at
by
moses
we
conclude
therefore
that
god
spake
thus
at
the
creation
that
the
word
might
have
his
part
in
the
work
and
so
that
operation
be
common
to
both
but
john
speaks
more
clearly
than
all
others
when
he
represents
who
from
the
beginning
god
with
as
in
union
with
the
father
the
original
cause
of
all
things
for
to
the
word
he
both
attributes
a
real
and
permanent
essence
and
assigns
some
peculiar
property
and
plainly
shows
how
god
by
speaking
created
the
world
therefore
as
all
divine
revelations
are
justly
entitled
word
of
so
we
ought
chiefly
to
esteem
that
substantial
word
the
source
of
all
revelations
who
is
liable
to
no
variation
who
remains
with
god
perpetually
one
and
the
same
and
who
is
god
himself
viii
here
we
are
interrupted
by
some
clamorous
objectors
who
since
they
can
not
openly
rob
him
of
his
divinity
secretly
steal
from
him
his
eternity
for
they
say
that
the
word
only
began
to
exist
when
god
opened
his
sacred
mouth
in
the
creation
of
the
world
but
they
are
too
inconsiderate
in
imagining
something
new
in
the
substance
of
god
for
as
those
names
of
god
which
relate
to
his
external
works
began
to
be
ascribed
to
him
after
the
existence
of
those
works
as
when
he
is
called
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
so
piety
neither
acknowledges
nor
admits
any
name
signifying
that
god
has
found
any
thing
new
to
happen
to
himself
for
could
any
thing
from
any
quarter
effect
a
change
in
him
it
would
contradict
the
assertion
of
james
that
every
good
gift
and
every
perfect
gift
is
from
above
and
cometh
down
from
the
father
of
lights
with
whom
is
no
variableness
or
shadow
of
nothing
then
is
more
intolerable
than
to
suppose
a
beginning
of
that
word
which
was
always
god
and
afterwards
the
creator
of
the
world
but
they
argue
in
their
own
apprehension
most
acutely
that
moses
by
representing
god
as
having
then
spoken
for
the
first
time
implies
also
that
there
was
no
word
in
him
before
than
which
nothing
is
more
absurd
for
it
is
not
to
be
concluded
because
any
thing
begins
to
be
manifested
at
a
certain
time
that
it
had
no
prior
existence
i
form
a
very
different
conclusion
that
since
in
the
very
instant
when
god
said
let
there
be
light
the
power
of
the
word
was
clearly
manifested
the
word
must
have
existed
long
before
but
if
any
one
inquires
how
long
he
will
find
no
beginning
for
he
limits
no
certain
period
of
time
when
he
himself
says
o
father
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
before
the
world
nor
is
this
omitted
by
john
for
before
he
descends
to
the
creation
of
the
world
he
declares
that
the
word
was
in
the
beginning
with
we
therefore
conclude
again
that
the
word
conceived
of
god
before
time
began
perpetually
remained
with
him
which
proves
his
eternity
his
true
essence
and
his
divinity
ix
though
i
advert
not
yet
to
the
person
of
the
mediator
but
defer
it
to
that
part
of
the
work
which
will
relate
to
redemption
yet
since
it
ought
without
controversy
to
be
believed
by
all
that
christ
is
the
very
same
word
clothed
in
flesh
any
testimonies
which
assert
the
deity
of
christ
will
be
very
properly
introduced
here
when
it
is
said
in
the
psalm
thy
throne
o
god
is
for
ever
and
ever
the
jews
endeavour
to
evade
its
force
by
pleading
that
the
name
elohim
is
applicable
also
to
angels
and
to
men
of
dignity
and
power
but
there
can
not
be
found
in
the
scripture
a
similar
passage
which
erects
an
eternal
throne
for
a
creature
for
he
is
not
merely
called
god
but
is
also
declared
to
possess
an
eternal
dominion
besides
this
title
is
never
given
to
a
creature
without
some
addition
as
when
it
is
said
that
moses
should
be
a
god
to
some
read
it
in
the
genitive
case
thy
throne
is
of
god
which
is
extremely
insipid
i
confess
indeed
that
what
is
eminently
and
singularly
excellent
is
frequently
called
divine
but
it
sufficiently
appears
from
the
context
that
such
a
meaning
would
be
uncouth
and
forced
and
totally
inapplicable
here
but
if
their
perverseness
refuse
to
yield
this
point
there
certainly
is
no
obscurity
in
isaiah
where
he
introduces
christ
as
god
and
as
crowned
with
supreme
power
which
is
the
prerogative
of
god
alone
his
name
says
he
shall
be
called
the
mighty
god
the
father
of
eternity
here
also
the
jews
object
and
invert
the
reading
of
the
passage
in
this
manner
this
is
the
name
by
which
the
mighty
god
the
father
of
eternity
shall
call
him
so
that
they
would
leave
the
son
only
the
title
of
prince
of
peace
but
to
what
purpose
would
so
many
epithets
be
accumulated
in
this
passage
on
god
the
father
when
the
design
of
the
prophet
is
to
distinguish
christ
by
such
eminent
characters
as
may
establish
our
faith
in
him
wherefore
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
is
there
denominated
the
mighty
god
just
as
a
little
before
he
is
called
immanuel
but
nothing
can
be
required
plainer
than
a
passage
in
jeremiah
that
this
should
be
the
name
whereby
the
branch
of
david
shall
be
called
jehovah
our
for
since
the
jews
themselves
teach
that
all
other
names
of
god
are
mere
epithets
but
that
this
alone
which
they
call
ineffable
is
a
proper
name
expressive
of
his
essence
we
conclude
that
the
son
is
the
one
eternal
god
who
declares
in
another
place
that
he
will
not
give
his
glory
to
this
also
they
endeavour
to
evade
because
moses
imposed
this
name
on
an
altar
which
he
built
and
ezekiel
on
the
city
of
the
new
jerusalem
but
who
does
not
perceive
that
the
altar
was
erected
as
a
monument
of
moses
having
been
exalted
by
god
and
that
jerusalem
is
honoured
with
the
name
of
god
only
as
a
testimony
of
the
divine
presence
for
thus
speaks
the
prophet
the
name
of
the
city
shall
be
jehovah
is
but
moses
expresses
himself
thus
he
built
an
altar
and
called
the
name
of
it
my
exaltation
but
there
is
more
contention
about
another
passage
of
jeremiah
where
the
same
title
is
given
to
jerusalem
in
these
words
this
is
the
name
wherewith
she
shall
be
called
jehovah
our
but
this
testimony
is
so
far
from
opposing
the
truth
which
we
are
defending
that
it
rather
confirms
it
for
having
before
testified
that
christ
is
the
true
jehovah
from
whom
righteousness
proceeds
he
now
pronounces
that
the
church
will
have
such
a
clear
apprehension
of
it
as
to
be
able
to
glory
in
the
same
name
in
the
former
place
then
is
shown
the
original
cause
of
righteousness
in
the
latter
the
effect
x
now
if
these
things
do
not
satisfy
the
jews
i
see
not
by
what
cavils
they
can
evade
the
accounts
of
jehovah
having
so
frequently
appeared
in
the
character
of
an
angel
an
angel
is
said
to
have
appeared
to
the
holy
fathers
he
claims
for
himself
the
name
of
the
eternal
god
if
it
be
objected
that
this
is
spoken
with
regard
to
the
character
which
he
sustains
this
by
no
means
removes
the
difficulty
for
a
servant
would
never
rob
god
of
his
honour
by
permitting
sacrifice
to
be
offered
to
himself
but
the
angel
refusing
to
eat
bread
commands
a
sacrifice
to
be
offered
to
jehovah
he
afterwards
demonstrates
that
he
is
really
jehovah
himself
therefore
manoah
and
his
wife
conclude
from
this
evidence
that
they
have
seen
not
a
mere
angel
but
god
himself
hence
he
says
we
shall
surely
die
because
we
have
seen
when
his
wife
replies
if
the
lord
were
pleased
to
kill
us
he
would
not
have
received
a
sacrifice
at
our
hands
she
clearly
acknowledges
him
to
be
god
who
before
is
called
an
angel
moreover
the
reply
of
the
angel
himself
removes
every
doubt
why
askest
thou
after
my
name
seeing
it
is
wonderful
so
much
the
more
detestable
is
the
impiety
of
servetus
in
asserting
that
god
never
appeared
to
abraham
and
the
other
patriarchs
but
that
they
worshipped
an
angel
in
his
stead
but
the
orthodox
doctors
of
the
church
have
truly
and
wisely
understood
and
taught
that
the
same
chief
angel
was
the
word
of
god
who
even
then
began
to
perform
some
services
introductory
to
his
execution
of
the
office
of
mediator
for
though
he
was
not
yet
incarnate
he
descended
as
it
were
in
a
mediatorial
capacity
that
he
might
approach
the
faithful
with
greater
familiarity
his
familiar
intercourse
with
men
gave
him
the
name
of
an
angel
yet
he
still
retained
what
properly
belonged
to
him
and
continued
the
ineffably
glorious
god
the
same
truth
is
attested
by
hosea
who
after
relating
the
wrestling
of
jacob
with
an
angel
says
the
lord
jehovah
god
of
hosts
jehovah
is
his
servetus
again
cavils
that
god
employed
the
person
of
an
angel
as
though
the
prophet
did
not
confirm
what
had
been
delivered
by
moses
wherefore
is
it
that
thou
dost
ask
after
my
name
and
the
confession
of
the
holy
patriarch
when
he
says
i
have
seen
god
face
to
face
sufficiently
declares
that
he
was
not
a
created
angel
but
one
in
whom
resided
the
fulness
of
deity
hence
also
the
representation
of
paul
that
christ
was
the
conductor
of
the
people
in
the
wilderness
because
though
the
time
of
his
humiliation
was
not
yet
arrived
the
eternal
word
then
exhibited
a
type
of
the
office
to
which
he
was
appointed
now
if
the
second
chapter
of
zechariah
be
strictly
and
coolly
examined
the
angel
who
sends
another
angel
is
immediately
pronounced
the
god
of
hosts
and
supreme
power
is
ascribed
to
him
i
omit
testimonies
innumerable
on
which
our
faith
safely
rests
although
they
have
little
influence
on
the
jews
for
when
it
is
said
in
isaiah
lo
this
is
our
god
we
have
waited
for
him
and
he
will
save
us
this
is
jehovah
all
who
have
eyes
may
perceive
that
this
is
god
who
arises
for
the
salvation
of
his
people
and
the
emphatical
repetition
of
these
pointed
expressions
forbids
an
application
of
this
passage
to
any
other
than
to
christ
but
still
more
plain
and
decisive
is
a
passage
of
malachi
where
he
prophesies
that
the
lord
who
was
then
sought
should
come
into
his
the
temple
was
exclusively
consecrated
to
the
one
most
high
god
yet
the
prophet
claims
it
as
belonging
to
christ
whence
it
follows
that
he
is
the
same
god
that
was
always
worshipped
among
the
jews
xi
the
new
testament
abounds
with
innumerable
testimonies
we
must
therefore
endeavour
briefly
to
select
a
few
rather
than
to
collect
them
all
though
the
apostles
spake
of
him
after
he
had
appeared
in
flesh
as
the
mediator
yet
all
that
i
shall
adduce
will
be
adapted
to
prove
his
eternal
deity
in
the
first
place
it
is
worthy
of
particular
observation
that
the
apostle
represents
those
things
which
were
predicted
concerning
the
eternal
god
as
either
already
exhibited
in
christ
or
to
be
accomplished
in
him
at
some
future
period
the
prediction
of
isaiah
that
the
lord
of
hosts
would
be
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
offence
to
both
the
houses
of
israel
paul
asserts
to
have
been
fulfilled
in
christ
therefore
he
declares
that
christ
is
the
lord
of
hosts
there
is
a
similar
instance
in
another
place
we
shall
all
stand
says
he
before
the
of
christ
for
it
is
written
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me
and
every
tongue
shall
confess
to
since
god
in
isaiah
declares
this
concerning
himself
and
christ
actually
exhibits
it
in
his
own
person
it
follows
that
he
is
that
very
god
whose
glory
can
not
be
transferred
to
another
the
apostle
s
quotation
from
the
psalms
also
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
is
evidently
applicable
to
none
but
god
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
understanding
that
ascension
to
have
been
prefigured
by
the
exertions
of
the
divine
power
in
the
signal
victories
of
david
over
the
heathen
nations
he
signifies
that
the
text
was
more
fully
accomplished
in
christ
thus
john
attests
that
it
was
the
glory
of
the
son
which
was
revealed
in
a
vision
to
isaiah
whereas
the
prophet
himself
records
that
he
saw
the
majesty
of
god
and
those
praises
which
the
apostle
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
ascribes
to
the
son
beyond
all
doubt
most
evidently
belong
to
god
thou
lord
in
the
beginning
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
works
of
thine
hands
again
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
nor
is
it
any
misapplication
of
them
when
he
refers
them
to
christ
since
all
that
is
predicted
in
those
psalms
has
been
accomplished
only
by
him
for
it
was
he
who
arose
and
had
mercy
upon
zion
it
was
he
who
claimed
as
his
own
the
dominion
over
all
nations
and
islands
and
why
should
john
after
having
affirmed
at
the
commencement
of
his
gospel
that
the
word
was
always
god
have
hesitated
to
attribute
to
christ
the
majesty
of
god
and
why
should
paul
have
been
afraid
to
place
christ
on
the
tribunal
of
god
after
having
so
publicly
preached
his
divinity
when
he
called
him
god
blessed
for
ever
and
to
show
how
consistent
he
is
with
himself
on
this
subject
he
says
also
that
god
was
manifest
in
the
if
he
is
god
blessed
for
ever
he
is
the
same
to
whom
this
apostle
in
another
place
affirms
all
glory
and
honour
to
be
due
and
he
conceals
not
but
openly
proclaims
that
being
in
the
form
of
god
he
thought
it
not
robbery
to
be
equal
with
god
but
made
himself
of
no
and
lest
the
impious
might
object
that
he
is
a
sort
of
artificial
god
john
goes
further
and
affirms
that
this
is
the
true
god
and
eternal
life
although
we
ought
to
be
fully
satisfied
by
his
being
called
god
especially
by
a
witness
who
expressly
avers
that
there
are
no
more
gods
than
one
i
mean
paul
who
says
though
there
be
that
are
called
gods
whether
in
heaven
or
in
earth
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
of
whom
are
all
when
we
hear
from
the
same
mouth
that
god
was
manifested
in
the
flesh
that
god
hath
purchased
the
church
with
his
own
blood
do
we
imagine
a
second
god
whom
he
by
no
means
acknowledges
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
pious
were
of
the
same
opinion
thomas
likewise
by
publicly
confessing
him
to
be
his
lord
and
god
declares
him
to
be
the
same
true
god
whom
he
had
always
worshipped
xii
if
we
judge
of
his
divinity
from
the
works
which
the
scriptures
attribute
to
him
it
will
thence
appear
with
increasing
evidence
for
when
he
said
that
he
had
from
the
beginning
continually
coöperated
with
the
father
the
jews
stupid
as
they
were
about
his
other
declarations
yet
perceived
that
he
assumed
to
himself
divine
power
and
therefore
as
john
informs
us
they
sought
the
more
to
kill
him
because
he
not
only
had
broken
the
sabbath
but
said
also
that
god
was
his
father
making
himself
equal
with
how
great
then
must
be
our
stupidity
if
we
perceive
not
this
passage
to
be
a
plain
assertion
of
his
divinity
to
preside
over
the
world
by
his
almighty
providence
and
to
govern
all
things
by
the
rod
of
his
own
power
which
the
apostle
attributes
to
him
belongs
exclusively
to
the
creator
and
he
participates
with
the
father
not
only
in
the
government
of
the
world
but
also
in
all
other
offices
which
can
not
be
communicated
to
creatures
the
lord
proclaims
by
the
prophet
i
even
i
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
according
to
this
declaration
when
the
jews
thought
that
christ
committed
an
injury
against
god
by
undertaking
to
forgive
sins
he
not
only
asserted
in
express
terms
that
this
power
belonged
to
him
but
proved
it
by
a
miracle
we
see
therefore
that
he
hath
not
the
ministry
but
the
power
of
remission
of
sins
which
the
lord
declares
shall
never
be
transferred
from
himself
to
another
is
it
not
the
prerogative
of
god
alone
to
examine
and
penetrate
the
secret
thoughts
of
the
heart
yet
christ
possessed
that
power
which
is
a
proof
of
his
divinity
xiii
but
with
what
perspicuity
of
evidence
does
it
appear
in
his
miracles
though
i
grant
that
the
prophets
and
apostles
performed
miracles
similar
and
equal
to
his
yet
there
is
a
considerable
difference
in
this
respect
that
they
in
their
ministry
dispensed
the
favours
of
god
whereas
his
miracles
were
performed
by
his
exertions
of
his
own
power
he
sometimes
indeed
used
prayer
that
he
might
glorify
the
father
but
in
most
instances
we
perceive
the
manifest
displays
of
his
own
power
and
how
should
not
he
be
the
true
author
of
miracles
who
by
his
own
authority
committed
the
dispensation
of
them
to
others
for
the
evangelists
relate
that
he
gave
his
apostles
power
to
raise
the
dead
to
heal
the
leprous
to
cast
out
devils
and
they
performed
that
ministry
in
such
a
manner
as
plainly
to
discover
that
the
power
proceeded
solely
from
christ
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
says
peter
arise
and
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
christ
should
bring
forward
his
miracles
to
convince
the
incredulity
of
the
jews
since
being
performed
by
his
own
power
they
afforded
most
ample
evidence
of
his
divinity
besides
if
out
of
god
there
be
no
salvation
no
righteousness
no
life
but
christ
contains
all
these
things
in
himself
it
certainly
demonstrates
him
to
be
god
let
it
not
be
objected
that
life
and
salvation
are
infused
into
him
by
god
for
he
is
not
said
to
have
received
salvation
but
to
be
himself
salvation
and
if
no
one
be
good
but
god
alone
how
can
he
be
a
mere
man
who
is
i
will
not
say
good
and
righteous
but
goodness
and
righteousness
itself
even
from
the
beginning
of
the
creation
according
to
the
testimony
of
an
evangelist
in
him
was
life
and
the
life
then
existed
as
the
light
of
supported
by
such
proofs
therefore
we
venture
to
repose
our
faith
and
hope
on
him
whereas
we
know
that
it
is
impious
and
sacrilegious
for
any
man
to
place
his
confidence
in
creatures
he
says
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
and
in
this
sense
paul
interprets
two
passages
of
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
not
be
again
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
that
shall
rise
to
reign
over
the
gentiles
in
him
shall
the
gentiles
and
why
should
we
search
for
more
testimonies
from
scripture
when
this
declaration
occurs
so
frequently
he
that
believeth
on
me
hath
everlasting
life
the
invocation
arising
from
faith
is
also
directed
to
him
which
nevertheless
peculiarly
belongs
if
any
thing
peculiarly
belongs
to
the
divine
majesty
for
a
prophet
says
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
jehovah
shall
be
and
solomon
the
name
of
the
lord
is
a
strong
tower
the
righteous
runneth
into
it
and
is
but
the
name
of
christ
is
invoked
for
salvation
it
follows
therefore
that
he
is
jehovah
moreover
we
have
an
example
of
such
invocation
in
stephen
when
he
says
lord
jesus
receive
my
and
afterwards
in
the
whole
church
as
ananias
testifies
in
the
same
book
lord
i
have
heard
by
many
of
this
man
how
much
evil
he
hath
done
to
thy
call
on
thy
and
to
make
it
more
clearly
understood
that
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
dwelleth
bodily
in
christ
the
apostle
confesses
that
he
had
introduced
among
the
corinthians
no
other
doctrine
than
the
knowledge
of
him
and
that
this
had
been
the
only
subject
of
his
preaching
what
a
remarkable
and
important
consideration
is
it
that
the
name
of
the
son
only
is
preached
to
us
whereas
god
commands
us
to
glory
in
the
knowledge
of
himself
alone
who
can
dare
to
assert
that
he
is
a
mere
creature
the
knowledge
of
whom
is
our
only
glory
it
must
also
be
remarked
that
the
salutations
prefixed
to
the
epistles
of
paul
implore
the
same
blessings
from
the
son
as
from
the
father
whence
we
learn
not
only
that
those
things
which
our
heavenly
father
bestows
are
obtained
for
us
by
his
intercession
but
that
the
son
by
a
communion
of
power
is
himself
the
author
of
them
this
practical
knowledge
is
unquestionably
more
certain
and
solid
than
any
idle
speculation
for
then
the
pious
mind
has
the
nearest
view
of
the
divine
presence
and
almost
touches
it
when
it
experiences
itself
to
be
quickened
illuminated
saved
justified
and
sanctified
xiv
wherefore
the
proof
of
the
deity
of
the
spirit
must
be
derived
principally
from
the
same
sources
there
is
no
obscurity
in
the
testimony
of
moses
in
the
history
of
the
creation
that
the
spirit
of
god
was
expanded
on
the
abyss
or
chaos
for
it
signifies
not
only
that
the
beautiful
state
of
the
world
which
we
now
behold
owes
its
preservation
to
the
power
of
the
spirit
but
that
previously
to
its
being
thus
adorned
the
spirit
was
engaged
in
brooding
over
the
confused
mass
the
declaration
of
isaiah
bids
defiance
to
all
cavils
and
now
the
lord
god
and
his
spirit
hath
sent
for
the
holy
spirit
is
united
in
the
exercise
of
supreme
power
in
the
mission
of
prophets
which
is
a
proof
of
his
divine
majesty
but
the
best
confirmation
as
i
have
remarked
we
shall
derive
from
familiar
experience
for
what
the
scriptures
ascribe
to
him
and
what
we
ourselves
learn
by
the
certain
experience
of
piety
is
not
at
all
applicable
to
any
creature
for
it
is
he
who
being
universally
diffused
sustains
and
animates
all
things
in
heaven
and
in
earth
and
this
very
thing
excludes
him
from
the
number
of
creatures
that
he
is
circumscribed
by
no
limits
but
transfuses
through
all
his
own
vigorous
influence
to
inspire
them
with
being
life
and
motion
this
is
clearly
a
work
of
deity
again
if
regeneration
to
an
incorruptible
life
be
more
important
and
excellent
than
any
present
life
what
must
we
think
of
him
from
whose
power
it
proceeds
but
the
scripture
teaches
in
various
places
that
he
is
the
author
of
regeneration
by
a
power
not
derived
but
properly
his
own
and
not
of
regeneration
only
but
likewise
of
the
future
immortality
finally
to
him
as
well
as
to
the
son
are
applied
all
those
offices
which
are
peculiar
to
deity
for
he
searcheth
even
the
deep
things
of
god
who
admits
no
creature
to
a
share
in
his
councils
he
bestows
wisdom
and
the
faculty
of
speech
whereas
the
lord
declares
to
moses
that
this
can
only
be
done
by
himself
so
through
him
we
attain
to
a
participation
of
god
to
feel
his
vivifying
energy
upon
us
our
justification
is
his
work
from
him
proceed
power
sanctification
truth
grace
and
every
other
blessing
we
can
conceive
since
there
is
but
one
spirit
from
whom
every
kind
of
gifts
descends
for
this
passage
of
paul
is
worthy
of
particular
attention
there
are
diversities
of
gifts
and
there
are
differences
of
administrations
but
the
same
spirit
because
it
represents
him
not
only
as
the
principle
and
source
of
them
but
also
as
the
author
which
is
yet
more
clearly
expressed
a
little
after
in
these
words
all
these
worketh
that
only
and
the
spirit
dividing
to
every
man
severally
as
he
for
if
he
were
not
a
subsistence
in
the
deity
judgment
and
voluntary
determination
would
never
be
ascribed
to
him
paul
therefore
very
clearly
attributes
to
the
spirit
divine
power
and
thereby
demonstrates
him
to
be
an
hypostasis
or
subsistence
in
god
xv
nor
does
the
scripture
when
it
speaks
of
him
refrain
from
giving
him
the
appellation
of
god
for
paul
concludes
that
we
are
the
temple
of
god
because
his
spirit
dwelleth
in
us
this
must
not
be
passed
over
without
particular
notice
for
the
frequent
promises
of
god
that
he
will
choose
us
for
a
temple
for
himself
receive
no
other
accomplishment
than
by
the
inhabitation
of
his
spirit
in
us
certainly
as
augustine
excellently
observes
if
we
were
commanded
to
erect
to
the
spirit
a
temple
of
wood
and
stone
forasmuch
as
god
is
the
sole
object
of
worship
it
would
be
a
clear
proof
of
his
divinity
how
much
clearer
then
is
the
proof
now
that
we
are
commanded
not
to
erect
one
but
to
be
ourselves
his
temples
and
the
apostle
calls
us
sometimes
the
temple
of
god
and
sometimes
the
temple
of
the
holy
spirit
both
in
the
same
signification
peter
reprehending
ananias
for
having
lied
to
the
holy
ghost
told
him
that
he
had
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
and
where
isaiah
introduces
the
lord
of
hosts
as
the
speaker
paul
informs
us
that
it
is
the
holy
spirit
who
speaks
indeed
while
the
prophets
invariably
declare
that
the
words
which
they
utter
are
those
of
the
lord
of
hosts
christ
and
the
apostles
refer
them
to
the
holy
spirit
whence
it
follows
that
he
is
the
true
jehovah
who
is
the
primary
author
of
the
prophecies
again
god
complains
that
his
anger
was
provoked
by
the
perverseness
of
the
people
isaiah
in
reference
to
the
same
conduct
says
that
they
vexed
his
holy
lastly
if
blasphemy
against
the
spirit
be
not
forgiven
either
in
this
world
or
in
that
which
is
to
come
whilst
a
man
may
obtain
pardon
who
has
been
guilty
of
blasphemy
against
the
son
this
is
an
open
declaration
of
his
divine
majesty
to
defame
or
degrade
which
is
an
inexpiable
crime
i
intentionally
pass
over
many
testimonies
which
were
used
by
the
fathers
to
them
there
appeared
much
plausibility
in
citing
this
passage
from
david
by
the
word
of
the
lord
were
the
heavens
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
to
prove
that
the
creation
of
the
world
was
the
work
of
the
holy
spirit
as
well
as
of
the
son
but
since
a
repetition
of
the
same
thing
twice
is
common
in
the
psalms
and
in
isaiah
the
spirit
of
his
mouth
means
the
same
as
his
word
this
is
but
a
weak
argument
therefore
i
have
determined
to
confine
myself
to
a
sober
statement
of
those
evidences
on
which
pious
minds
may
satisfactorily
rest
xvi
as
god
afforded
a
clearer
manifestation
of
himself
at
the
advent
of
christ
the
three
persons
also
then
became
better
known
among
many
testimonies
let
us
be
satisfied
with
this
one
paul
connects
together
these
three
lord
faith
and
baptism
in
such
a
manner
as
to
reason
from
one
to
another
since
there
is
but
one
faith
hence
he
proves
that
there
is
but
one
lord
since
there
is
but
one
baptism
he
shows
that
there
is
also
but
one
faith
therefore
if
we
are
initiated
by
baptism
into
the
faith
and
religion
of
one
god
we
must
necessarily
suppose
him
to
be
the
true
god
into
whose
name
we
are
baptized
nor
can
it
be
doubted
but
that
in
this
solemn
commission
baptize
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
ghost
christ
intended
to
testify
that
the
perfect
light
of
faith
was
now
exhibited
for
this
is
equivalent
to
being
baptized
into
the
name
of
the
one
god
who
hath
clearly
manifested
himself
in
the
father
son
and
spirit
whence
it
evidently
appears
that
in
the
divine
essence
there
exist
three
persons
in
whom
is
known
the
one
god
and
truly
since
faith
ought
not
to
be
looking
about
hither
and
thither
or
to
be
wandering
through
the
varieties
of
inconstancy
but
to
direct
its
views
towards
the
one
god
to
be
fixed
on
him
and
to
adhere
to
him
may
easily
be
proved
from
these
premises
that
if
there
be
various
kinds
of
faith
there
must
also
be
a
plurality
of
gods
baptism
being
a
sacrament
of
faith
confirms
to
us
the
unity
of
god
because
it
is
but
one
hence
also
we
conclude
that
it
is
not
lawful
to
be
baptized
except
into
the
name
of
the
one
god
because
we
embrace
the
faith
of
him
into
whose
name
we
are
baptized
what
then
was
intended
by
christ
when
he
commanded
baptism
to
be
administered
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
spirit
but
that
one
faith
ought
to
be
exercised
in
the
father
son
and
spirit
and
what
is
that
but
a
clear
testimony
that
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
spirit
are
the
one
god
therefore
since
it
is
an
undeniable
truth
that
there
is
one
god
and
only
one
we
conclude
the
word
and
spirit
to
be
no
other
than
the
very
essence
of
the
deity
the
greatest
degree
of
folly
was
betrayed
by
the
arians
who
confessed
the
divinity
of
the
son
but
denied
him
to
possess
the
substance
of
god
nor
were
the
macedonians
free
from
a
similar
delusion
who
would
explain
the
term
spirit
to
mean
only
the
gifts
of
grace
conferred
upon
man
for
as
wisdom
understanding
prudence
fortitude
and
the
fear
of
the
lord
proceed
from
him
so
he
alone
is
the
spirit
of
wisdom
prudence
fortitude
and
piety
nor
is
he
himself
divided
according
to
the
distribution
of
his
graces
but
as
the
apostle
declares
how
variously
soever
they
are
divided
he
always
remains
one
and
the
same
xvii
on
the
other
hand
also
we
find
in
the
scriptures
a
distinction
between
the
father
and
the
word
between
the
word
and
the
spirit
in
the
discussion
of
which
the
magnitude
of
the
mystery
reminds
us
that
we
ought
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
reverence
and
sobriety
i
am
exceedingly
pleased
with
this
observation
of
gregory
nazianzen
i
can
not
think
of
the
but
i
am
immediately
surrounded
with
the
splendour
of
the
nor
can
i
clearly
discover
the
but
i
am
suddenly
carried
back
to
the
wherefore
let
us
not
imagine
such
a
trinity
of
persons
as
includes
an
idea
of
separation
or
does
not
immediately
recall
us
to
the
unity
the
names
of
father
son
and
spirit
certainly
imply
a
real
distinction
let
no
one
suppose
them
to
be
mere
epithets
by
which
god
is
variously
designated
from
his
works
but
it
is
a
distinction
not
a
division
the
passages
already
cited
show
that
the
son
has
a
property
by
which
he
is
distinguished
from
the
father
because
the
word
had
not
been
with
god
or
had
his
glory
with
the
father
unless
he
had
been
distinct
from
him
he
likewise
distinguishes
the
father
from
himself
when
he
says
that
there
is
another
that
beareth
witness
of
and
to
the
same
effect
is
what
is
declared
in
another
place
that
the
father
created
all
things
by
the
word
which
he
could
not
have
done
unless
he
had
been
in
some
sense
distinct
from
him
besides
the
father
descended
not
to
the
earth
but
he
who
came
forth
from
the
father
the
father
neither
died
nor
rose
again
but
he
who
was
sent
by
the
father
nor
did
this
distinction
commence
at
the
incarnation
but
it
is
evident
that
before
that
period
he
was
the
only
begotten
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
for
who
can
undertake
to
assert
that
the
son
first
entered
into
the
bosom
of
the
father
when
he
descended
from
heaven
to
assume
a
human
nature
he
therefore
was
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
before
and
possessed
his
glory
with
the
father
the
distinction
between
the
holy
spirit
and
the
father
is
announced
by
christ
when
he
says
that
he
proceedeth
from
the
but
how
often
does
he
represent
him
as
another
distinct
from
himself
as
when
he
promises
that
another
comforter
should
be
sent
and
in
many
other
places
xviii
i
doubt
the
propriety
of
borrowing
similitudes
from
human
things
to
express
the
force
of
this
distinction
the
fathers
sometimes
practise
this
method
but
they
likewise
confess
the
great
disproportion
of
all
the
similitudes
which
they
introduce
wherefore
i
greatly
dread
in
this
instance
every
degree
of
presumption
lest
the
introduction
of
any
thing
unseasonable
should
afford
an
occasion
of
calumny
to
the
malicious
or
of
error
to
the
ignorant
yet
it
is
not
right
to
be
silent
on
the
distinction
which
we
find
expressed
in
the
scriptures
which
is
to
the
father
is
attributed
the
principle
of
action
the
fountain
and
source
of
all
things
to
the
son
wisdom
counsel
and
the
arrangement
of
all
operations
and
the
power
and
efficacy
of
the
action
is
assigned
to
the
spirit
moreover
though
eternity
belongs
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
spirit
also
since
god
can
never
have
been
destitute
of
his
wisdom
or
his
power
and
in
eternity
we
must
not
inquire
after
any
thing
prior
or
posterior
the
observation
of
order
is
not
vain
or
superfluous
while
the
father
is
mentioned
as
first
in
the
next
place
the
son
as
from
him
and
then
the
spirit
as
from
both
for
the
mind
of
every
man
naturally
inclines
to
the
consideration
first
of
god
secondly
of
the
wisdom
emanating
from
him
and
lastly
of
the
power
by
which
he
executes
the
decrees
of
his
wisdom
for
this
reason
the
son
is
said
to
be
from
the
father
and
the
spirit
from
both
the
father
and
the
son
and
that
in
various
places
but
nowhere
more
clearly
than
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
romans
where
the
same
spirit
is
indifferently
denominated
the
spirit
of
christ
and
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
and
that
without
any
impropriety
for
peter
also
testifies
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
christ
by
whom
the
prophets
prophesied
whereas
the
scripture
so
frequently
declares
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
god
the
father
xix
this
distinction
is
so
far
from
opposing
the
most
absolute
simplicity
and
unity
of
the
divine
being
that
it
affords
a
proof
that
the
son
is
one
god
with
the
father
because
he
has
the
same
spirit
with
him
and
that
the
spirit
is
not
a
different
substance
from
the
father
and
the
son
because
he
is
the
spirit
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
for
the
whole
nature
is
in
each
hypostasis
and
each
has
something
peculiar
to
himself
the
father
is
entirely
in
the
son
and
the
son
entirely
in
the
father
according
to
his
own
declaration
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
in
me
nor
do
ecclesiastical
writers
allow
that
one
is
divided
from
the
other
by
any
difference
of
essence
these
distinctive
appellations
says
augustine
denote
their
reciprocal
relations
to
each
other
and
not
the
substance
itself
which
is
but
this
explanation
may
serve
to
reconcile
the
opinions
of
the
fathers
which
would
otherwise
appear
totally
repugnant
to
each
other
for
sometimes
they
state
that
the
son
originates
from
the
father
and
at
other
times
assert
that
he
has
essential
divinity
from
himself
and
so
is
together
with
the
father
the
one
first
cause
of
all
augustine
in
another
place
admirably
and
perspicuously
explains
the
cause
of
this
diversity
in
the
following
manner
christ
considered
in
himself
is
called
god
but
with
relation
to
the
father
he
is
called
the
and
again
the
father
considered
in
himself
is
called
god
but
with
relation
to
the
son
he
is
called
the
father
he
who
with
relation
to
the
son
is
called
the
father
is
not
the
son
he
who
with
relation
to
the
father
is
called
the
son
is
not
the
father
they
who
are
severally
called
the
father
and
the
son
are
the
same
therefore
when
we
speak
simply
of
the
son
without
reference
to
the
father
we
truly
and
properly
assert
him
to
be
and
therefore
call
him
the
sole
first
cause
but
when
we
distinctly
treat
of
the
relation
between
him
and
the
father
we
justly
represent
him
as
originating
from
the
father
the
first
book
of
augustine
on
the
trinity
is
entirely
occupied
with
the
explication
of
this
subject
and
it
is
far
more
safe
to
rest
satisfied
with
that
relation
which
he
states
than
by
curiously
penetrating
into
the
sublime
mystery
to
wander
through
a
multitude
of
vain
speculations
xx
therefore
let
such
as
love
sobriety
and
will
be
contented
with
the
measure
of
faith
briefly
attend
to
what
is
useful
to
be
known
which
is
that
when
we
profess
to
believe
in
one
god
the
word
denotes
a
single
and
simple
essence
in
which
we
comprehend
three
persons
or
hypostases
and
that
therefore
whenever
the
word
is
used
indefinitely
the
son
and
spirit
are
intended
as
much
as
the
father
but
when
the
son
is
associated
with
the
father
that
introduces
the
reciprocal
relation
of
one
to
the
other
and
thus
we
distinguish
between
the
persons
but
since
the
peculiar
properties
of
the
persons
produce
a
certain
order
so
that
the
original
cause
is
in
the
father
whenever
the
father
and
the
son
or
spirit
are
mentioned
together
the
name
of
god
is
peculiarly
ascribed
to
the
father
by
this
method
the
unity
of
the
essence
is
preserved
and
the
order
is
retained
which
however
derogates
nothing
from
the
deity
of
the
son
and
spirit
and
indeed
as
we
have
already
seen
that
the
apostles
assert
him
to
be
the
son
of
god
whom
moses
and
the
prophets
have
represented
as
jehovah
it
is
always
necessary
to
recur
to
the
unity
of
the
essence
wherefore
it
would
be
a
detestable
sacrilege
for
us
to
call
the
son
another
god
different
from
the
father
because
the
simple
name
of
god
admits
of
no
relation
nor
can
god
with
respect
to
himself
be
denominated
either
the
one
or
the
other
now
that
the
name
jehovah
in
an
indefinite
sense
is
applicable
to
christ
appears
even
from
the
words
of
paul
for
this
thing
i
besought
the
lord
thrice
because
after
relating
the
answer
of
christ
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
thee
he
immediately
subjoins
that
the
power
of
christ
may
rest
upon
for
it
is
certain
that
the
word
lord
is
there
used
for
jehovah
and
to
restrict
it
to
the
person
of
the
mediator
would
be
frivolous
and
puerile
since
it
is
an
absolute
declaration
containing
no
comparison
between
the
son
and
the
father
and
we
know
that
the
apostles
following
the
custom
of
the
greek
translators
invariably
use
the
word
κυριος
lord
instead
of
jehovah
and
not
to
seek
far
for
an
example
of
this
paul
prayed
to
the
lord
in
no
other
sense
than
is
intended
in
a
passage
of
joel
cited
by
peter
whosoever
shall
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
shall
be
but
for
the
peculiar
ascription
of
this
name
to
the
son
another
reason
will
be
given
in
its
proper
place
suffice
it
at
present
to
observe
that
when
paul
had
prayed
to
god
absolutely
he
immediately
subjoins
the
name
of
christ
thus
also
the
whole
deity
is
by
christ
himself
denominated
a
for
nothing
opposes
the
spirituality
of
the
whole
divine
essence
in
which
are
comprehended
the
father
the
son
and
the
spirit
which
is
plain
from
the
scripture
for
as
we
there
find
god
denominated
a
spirit
so
we
find
also
the
holy
spirit
forasmuch
as
he
is
an
hypostasis
of
the
whole
essence
represented
both
as
the
spirit
of
god
and
as
proceeding
from
god
xxi
but
since
satan
in
order
to
subvert
the
very
foundations
of
our
faith
has
always
been
exciting
great
contentions
concerning
the
divine
essence
of
the
son
and
spirit
and
the
distinction
of
the
persons
and
in
almost
all
ages
has
instigated
impious
spirits
to
vex
the
orthodox
teachers
on
this
account
and
is
also
endeavouring
in
the
present
day
with
the
old
embers
to
kindle
a
new
flame
it
becomes
necessary
here
to
refute
the
perverse
and
fanciful
notions
which
some
persons
have
imbibed
hitherto
it
has
been
our
principal
design
to
instruct
the
docile
and
not
to
combat
the
obstinate
and
contentious
but
now
having
calmly
explained
and
proved
the
truth
we
must
vindicate
it
from
all
the
cavils
of
the
wicked
although
i
shall
make
it
my
principal
study
that
those
who
readily
and
implicitly
attend
to
the
divine
word
may
have
stable
ground
on
which
they
may
confidently
rest
on
this
indeed
if
on
any
of
the
secret
mysteries
of
the
scripture
we
ought
to
philosophize
with
great
sobriety
and
moderation
and
also
with
extreme
caution
lest
either
our
ideas
or
our
language
should
proceed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
divine
word
for
how
can
the
infinite
essence
of
god
be
defined
by
the
narrow
capacity
of
the
human
mind
which
could
never
yet
certainly
determine
the
nature
of
the
body
of
the
sun
though
the
object
of
our
daily
contemplation
how
can
the
human
mind
by
its
own
efforts
penetrate
into
an
examination
of
the
essence
of
god
when
it
is
totally
ignorant
of
its
own
wherefore
let
us
freely
leave
to
god
the
knowledge
of
himself
for
he
alone
as
hilary
says
is
a
competent
witness
for
himself
being
only
known
by
and
we
shall
certainly
leave
it
to
him
if
our
conceptions
of
him
correspond
to
the
manifestations
which
he
has
given
us
of
himself
and
our
inquiries
concerning
him
are
confined
to
his
word
there
are
extant
on
this
argument
five
homilies
of
chrysostom
against
the
anomœi
which
however
were
not
sufficient
to
restrain
the
presumptuous
garrulity
of
those
sophists
for
they
discovered
no
greater
modesty
in
this
instance
than
in
every
other
the
very
unhappy
consequences
of
this
temerity
should
warn
us
to
study
this
question
with
more
docility
than
subtlety
and
not
allow
ourselves
to
investigate
god
any
where
but
in
his
sacred
word
or
to
form
any
ideas
of
him
but
such
as
are
agreeable
to
his
word
or
to
speak
any
thing
concerning
him
but
what
is
derived
from
the
same
word
but
if
the
distinction
of
father
son
and
spirit
in
the
one
deity
as
it
is
not
easy
to
be
comprehended
occasions
some
understandings
more
labour
and
trouble
than
is
desirable
let
them
remember
that
the
mind
of
man
when
it
indulges
its
curiosity
enters
into
a
labyrinth
and
let
them
submit
to
be
guided
by
the
heavenly
oracles
however
they
may
not
comprehend
the
height
of
this
mystery
xxii
to
compose
a
catalogue
of
the
errors
by
which
the
purity
of
the
faith
has
been
attacked
on
this
point
of
doctrine
would
be
too
prolix
and
tedious
without
being
profitable
and
most
of
the
heretics
so
strenuously
exerted
themselves
to
effect
the
total
extinction
of
the
divine
glory
by
their
gross
reveries
that
they
thought
it
sufficient
to
unsettle
and
disturb
the
inexperienced
from
a
few
men
there
soon
arose
numerous
sects
of
whom
some
would
divide
the
divine
essence
and
others
would
confound
the
distinction
which
subsists
between
the
persons
but
if
we
maintain
what
has
already
been
sufficiently
demonstrated
from
the
scripture
that
the
essence
of
the
one
god
which
pertains
to
the
father
to
the
son
and
to
the
spirit
is
simple
and
undivided
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
father
is
by
some
property
distinguished
from
the
son
and
likewise
the
son
from
the
spirit
the
gate
will
be
shut
not
only
against
arius
and
sabellius
but
also
against
all
the
other
ancient
heresiarchs
but
since
our
own
times
have
witnessed
some
madmen
as
servetus
and
his
followers
who
have
involved
every
thing
in
new
subtleties
a
brief
exposure
of
their
fallacies
will
not
be
unuseful
the
word
was
so
odious
and
even
detestable
to
servetus
that
he
asserted
all
trinitarians
as
he
called
them
to
be
atheists
i
omit
his
impertinent
and
scurrilous
language
but
this
was
the
substance
of
his
speculations
that
it
is
representing
god
as
consisting
of
three
parts
when
three
persons
are
said
to
subsist
in
his
essence
and
that
this
triad
is
merely
imaginary
being
repugnant
to
the
divine
unity
at
the
same
time
he
maintained
the
persons
to
be
certain
external
ideas
which
have
no
real
subsistence
in
the
divine
essence
but
give
us
a
figurative
representation
of
god
under
this
or
the
other
form
and
that
in
the
beginning
there
was
no
distinction
in
god
because
the
word
was
once
the
same
as
the
spirit
but
that
after
christ
appeared
god
of
god
there
emanated
from
him
another
god
even
the
spirit
though
he
sometimes
glosses
over
his
impertinencies
with
allegories
as
when
he
says
that
the
eternal
word
of
god
was
the
spirit
of
christ
with
god
and
the
reflection
of
his
image
and
that
the
spirit
was
a
shadow
of
the
deity
yet
he
afterwards
destroys
the
deity
of
both
asserting
that
according
to
the
mode
of
dispensation
there
is
a
part
of
god
in
both
the
son
and
the
spirit
just
as
the
same
spirit
substantially
diffused
in
us
and
even
in
wood
and
stones
is
a
portion
of
the
deity
what
he
broached
concerning
the
person
of
the
mediator
we
shall
examine
in
the
proper
place
but
this
monstrous
fiction
that
a
divine
person
is
nothing
but
a
visible
appearance
of
the
glory
of
god
will
not
need
a
prolix
refutation
for
when
john
pronounces
that
the
word
λογος
was
god
before
the
creation
of
the
world
he
sufficiently
discriminates
him
from
an
ideal
form
but
if
then
also
and
from
the
remotest
eternity
that
word
λογος
who
was
god
was
with
the
father
and
possessed
his
own
glory
with
the
father
he
certainly
could
not
be
an
external
or
figurative
splendour
but
it
necessarily
follows
that
he
was
a
real
hypostasis
subsisting
in
god
himself
but
although
no
mention
is
made
of
the
spirit
but
in
the
history
of
the
creation
of
the
world
yet
he
is
there
introduced
not
as
a
shadow
but
as
the
essential
power
of
god
since
moses
relates
that
the
chaotic
mass
was
supported
by
him
it
then
appeared
therefore
that
the
eternal
spirit
had
always
existed
in
the
deity
since
he
cherished
and
sustained
the
confused
matter
of
the
heaven
and
earth
till
it
attained
a
state
of
beauty
and
order
he
certainly
could
not
then
be
an
image
or
representation
of
god
according
to
the
dreams
of
servetus
but
in
other
places
he
is
constrained
to
make
a
fuller
disclosure
of
his
impiety
saying
that
god
in
his
eternal
reason
decreeing
for
himself
a
visible
son
has
visibly
exhibited
himself
in
this
manner
for
if
this
be
true
there
is
no
other
divinity
left
to
christ
than
as
he
has
been
appointed
a
son
by
an
eternal
decree
of
god
besides
he
so
transforms
those
phantasms
which
he
substitutes
instead
of
the
hypostases
that
he
hesitates
not
to
imagine
new
accidents
or
properties
in
god
but
the
most
execrable
blasphemy
of
all
is
his
promiscuous
confusion
of
the
son
of
god
and
the
spirit
with
all
the
creatures
for
he
asserts
that
in
the
divine
essence
there
are
parts
and
divisions
every
portion
of
which
is
god
and
especially
that
the
souls
of
the
faithful
are
coëternal
and
consubstantial
with
god
though
in
another
place
he
assigns
substantial
deity
not
only
to
the
human
soul
but
to
all
created
things
xxiii
from
the
same
corrupt
source
has
proceeded
another
heresy
equally
monstrous
for
some
worthless
men
to
escape
the
odium
and
disgrace
which
attended
the
impious
tenets
of
servetus
have
confessed
indeed
that
there
are
three
persons
but
with
this
explanation
that
the
father
who
alone
is
truly
and
properly
god
hath
created
the
son
and
spirit
and
transfused
his
deity
into
them
nor
do
they
refrain
from
this
dreadful
manner
of
expressing
themselves
that
the
father
is
distinguished
from
the
son
and
spirit
as
being
the
sole
possessor
of
the
divine
essence
their
first
plea
in
support
of
this
notion
is
that
christ
is
commonly
called
the
son
of
god
whence
they
conclude
that
no
other
is
properly
god
but
the
father
but
they
observe
not
that
although
the
name
of
god
is
common
also
to
the
son
yet
that
it
is
sometimes
ascribed
to
the
father
ἐξοχην
by
way
of
eminence
because
he
is
the
fountain
and
original
of
the
deity
and
this
in
order
to
denote
the
simple
unity
of
the
essence
they
object
that
if
he
is
truly
the
son
of
god
it
is
absurd
to
account
him
the
son
of
a
person
i
reply
that
both
are
true
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
because
he
is
the
word
begotten
of
the
father
before
time
began
for
we
are
not
yet
speaking
of
the
person
of
the
mediator
and
to
be
explicit
we
must
notice
the
person
that
the
name
of
god
may
not
be
understood
absolutely
but
for
the
father
for
if
we
acknowledge
no
other
to
be
god
than
the
father
it
will
be
a
manifest
degradation
of
the
dignity
of
the
son
whenever
mention
is
made
of
the
deity
therefore
there
must
no
opposition
be
admitted
between
the
father
and
the
son
as
though
the
name
of
the
true
god
belonged
exclusively
to
the
father
for
surely
the
god
who
appeared
to
isaiah
was
the
only
true
god
whom
nevertheless
john
affirms
to
have
been
christ
he
likewise
who
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
declared
that
he
was
to
be
a
rock
of
offence
to
the
jews
was
the
only
true
god
whom
paul
pronounces
to
have
been
christ
he
who
proclaims
by
isaiah
as
i
live
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me
is
the
only
true
god
but
paul
applies
the
same
to
christ
to
the
same
purpose
are
the
testimonies
recited
by
the
thou
lord
hast
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
and
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
these
ascriptions
belong
only
to
the
one
true
god
whereas
he
contends
that
they
are
properly
applied
to
christ
nor
is
there
any
force
in
that
cavil
that
what
is
proper
to
god
is
transferred
to
christ
because
he
is
the
brightness
of
his
glory
for
since
the
name
jehovah
is
used
in
each
of
these
passages
it
follows
that
in
respect
of
his
deity
he
is
for
if
he
is
jehovah
he
can
not
be
denied
to
be
the
same
god
who
in
another
place
proclaims
by
isaiah
i
am
the
first
and
i
am
the
last
and
beside
me
there
is
no
that
passage
in
jeremiah
also
deserves
our
the
gods
that
have
not
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
even
they
shall
perish
from
the
earth
and
from
under
these
heavens
whilst
on
the
contrary
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
deity
of
the
son
of
god
is
frequently
proved
by
isaiah
from
the
creation
of
the
world
but
how
shall
the
creator
who
gives
existence
to
all
not
be
but
derive
his
essence
from
another
for
whoever
asserts
that
the
son
owes
his
essence
to
the
father
denies
him
to
be
existent
but
this
is
contradicted
by
the
holy
spirit
who
gives
him
the
name
of
jehovah
now
if
we
admit
the
whole
essence
to
be
solely
in
the
father
either
it
will
be
divisible
or
it
will
be
taken
away
from
the
son
and
so
being
despoiled
of
his
essence
he
will
be
only
a
titular
god
the
divine
essence
according
to
these
triflers
belongs
solely
to
the
father
inasmuch
as
he
alone
possesses
it
and
is
the
author
of
the
essence
of
the
son
thus
the
divinity
of
the
son
will
be
a
kind
of
emanation
from
the
essence
of
god
or
a
derivation
of
a
part
from
the
whole
now
they
must
of
necessity
concede
from
their
own
premises
that
the
spirit
is
the
spirit
of
the
father
only
because
if
he
be
a
derivation
from
the
original
essence
which
belongs
exclusively
to
the
father
he
can
not
be
accounted
the
spirit
of
the
son
which
is
refuted
by
the
testimony
of
paul
where
he
makes
him
common
to
christ
and
the
father
besides
if
the
person
of
the
father
be
expunged
from
the
trinity
wherein
will
he
differ
from
the
son
and
spirit
but
in
being
himself
the
sole
deity
they
confess
that
christ
is
god
and
yet
differs
from
the
father
some
distinctive
character
is
necessary
also
to
discriminate
the
father
from
the
son
they
who
place
this
in
the
essence
manifestly
destroy
the
true
deity
of
christ
which
can
not
exist
independently
of
the
essence
that
is
of
the
entire
essence
the
father
certainly
can
not
differ
from
the
son
unless
he
have
something
peculiar
to
himself
which
is
not
common
to
the
son
what
will
they
find
by
which
to
distinguish
him
if
the
difference
be
in
the
essence
let
them
tell
us
whether
he
has
communicated
the
same
to
the
son
but
this
could
not
be
done
partially
for
it
would
be
an
abomination
to
fabricate
a
demigod
besides
this
would
miserably
dismember
the
divine
essence
the
necessary
conclusion
then
is
that
it
is
entirely
and
perfectly
common
to
the
father
and
the
son
and
if
this
be
true
there
can
not
in
respect
of
the
essence
be
any
difference
between
them
if
it
be
objected
that
the
father
notwithstanding
this
communication
of
his
essence
remains
the
only
god
with
whom
the
essence
continues
then
christ
must
be
a
figurative
god
a
god
in
appearance
and
name
only
not
in
reality
because
nothing
is
more
proper
to
god
than
to
be
according
to
that
declaration
i
am
hath
sent
me
unto
xxiv
we
might
readily
prove
from
many
passages
the
falsehood
of
their
assumption
that
whenever
the
name
of
god
is
mentioned
absolutely
in
the
scripture
it
means
only
the
father
and
in
those
places
which
they
cite
in
their
own
defence
they
shamefully
betray
their
ignorance
since
the
son
is
there
added
from
which
it
appears
that
the
name
of
god
is
used
in
a
relative
sense
and
therefore
is
particularly
restricted
to
the
person
of
the
father
their
objection
that
unless
the
father
alone
were
the
true
god
he
would
himself
be
his
own
father
is
answered
in
a
word
for
there
is
no
absurdity
in
the
name
of
god
for
the
sake
of
dignity
and
order
being
peculiarly
given
to
him
who
not
only
hath
begotten
of
himself
his
own
wisdom
but
is
also
the
god
of
the
mediator
of
which
i
shall
treat
more
at
large
in
its
proper
place
for
since
christ
was
manifested
in
the
flesh
he
is
called
the
son
of
god
not
only
as
he
was
the
eternal
word
begotten
of
the
father
before
time
began
but
because
he
assumed
the
person
and
office
of
a
mediator
to
unite
us
to
god
and
since
they
so
presumptuously
exclude
the
son
from
divine
honours
i
would
wish
to
be
informed
when
he
declares
that
there
is
none
good
but
the
one
god
whether
he
deprives
himself
of
all
goodness
i
speak
not
of
his
human
nature
lest
they
should
object
that
whatever
goodness
it
had
it
was
gratuitously
conferred
on
it
i
demand
whether
the
eternal
word
of
god
be
good
or
not
if
they
answer
in
the
negative
they
are
sufficiently
convicted
of
impiety
and
if
in
the
affirmative
they
cut
the
throat
of
their
own
system
but
though
at
the
first
glance
christ
seems
to
deny
himself
the
appellation
of
good
he
furnishes
notwithstanding
a
further
confirmation
of
our
opinion
for
as
that
is
a
title
which
peculiarly
belongs
to
the
one
god
forasmuch
as
he
had
been
saluted
as
good
merely
according
to
a
common
custom
by
his
rejection
of
false
honour
he
suggested
that
the
goodness
which
he
possessed
was
divine
i
demand
also
when
paul
affirms
that
god
alone
is
immortal
wise
and
true
whether
he
thereby
degrades
christ
to
the
rank
of
those
who
are
mortal
unwise
and
false
shall
not
he
then
be
immortal
who
from
the
beginning
was
life
itself
and
the
giver
of
immortality
to
angels
shall
not
he
be
wise
who
is
the
eternal
wisdom
of
god
shall
not
he
be
true
who
is
truth
itself
i
demand
further
whether
they
think
that
christ
ought
to
be
worshipped
for
if
he
justly
claims
this
as
his
right
that
every
knee
should
bow
before
him
it
follows
that
he
is
that
god
who
in
the
law
prohibited
the
worship
of
any
one
but
himself
if
they
will
have
this
passage
in
isaiah
i
am
and
there
is
no
god
besides
me
to
be
understood
solely
of
the
father
i
retort
this
testimony
on
themselves
since
we
see
that
whatever
belongs
to
god
is
attributed
to
christ
nor
is
there
any
room
for
their
cavil
that
christ
was
exalted
in
the
humanity
in
which
he
had
been
abased
and
that
with
regard
to
his
humanity
all
power
was
given
to
him
in
heaven
and
in
earth
because
although
the
regal
and
judicial
majesty
extends
to
the
whole
person
of
the
mediator
yet
had
he
not
been
god
manifested
in
the
flesh
he
could
not
have
been
exalted
to
such
an
eminence
without
god
being
in
opposition
to
himself
and
paul
excellently
determines
this
controversy
by
informing
us
that
he
was
equal
with
god
before
he
abased
himself
under
the
form
of
a
servant
now
how
could
this
equality
subsist
unless
he
had
been
that
god
whose
name
is
jah
and
jehovah
who
rides
on
the
cherubim
whose
kingdom
is
universal
and
everlasting
no
clamour
of
theirs
can
deprive
christ
of
another
declaration
of
isaiah
lo
this
is
our
god
we
have
waited
for
him
since
in
these
words
he
describes
the
advent
of
god
the
redeemer
not
only
for
the
deliverance
of
the
people
from
exile
in
babylon
but
also
for
the
complete
restoration
of
the
church
nor
do
they
gain
any
thing
by
another
cavil
that
christ
was
god
in
his
father
for
although
we
confess
in
point
of
order
and
degree
that
the
father
is
the
fountain
of
the
deity
yet
we
pronounce
it
a
detestable
figment
that
the
essence
belongs
exclusively
to
the
father
as
though
he
were
the
author
of
the
deity
of
the
son
because
on
this
supposition
either
the
essence
would
be
divided
or
christ
would
be
only
a
titular
and
imaginary
god
if
they
admit
that
the
son
is
god
but
inferior
to
the
father
then
in
him
the
essence
must
be
begotten
and
created
which
in
the
father
is
unbegotten
and
uncreated
i
know
that
some
scorners
ridicule
our
concluding
a
distinction
of
persons
from
the
words
of
moses
where
he
introduces
god
thus
speaking
let
us
make
man
in
our
yet
pious
readers
perceive
how
frigidly
and
foolishly
moses
would
have
introduced
this
conference
if
in
one
god
there
had
not
subsisted
a
plurality
of
persons
now
it
is
certain
that
they
whom
the
father
addressed
were
uncreated
but
there
is
nothing
uncreated
except
the
one
god
himself
now
therefore
unless
they
grant
that
the
power
to
create
and
the
authority
to
command
were
common
to
the
father
the
son
and
the
spirit
it
will
follow
that
god
did
not
speak
thus
within
himself
but
directed
his
conversation
to
some
exterior
agents
lastly
one
place
will
easily
remove
their
two
objections
at
once
for
when
christ
himself
declares
that
god
is
a
spirit
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
restrict
this
solely
to
the
father
as
though
the
word
were
not
also
of
a
spiritual
nature
but
if
the
name
of
spirit
is
equally
as
applicable
to
the
son
as
to
the
father
i
conclude
that
the
son
is
comprehended
under
the
indefinite
name
of
god
yet
he
immediately
subjoins
that
none
are
approved
worshippers
of
the
father
but
those
who
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
whence
follows
another
consequence
that
because
christ
performs
the
office
of
a
teacher
in
a
station
of
inferiority
he
ascribes
the
name
of
god
to
the
father
not
to
destroy
his
own
deity
but
by
degrees
to
raise
us
to
the
knowledge
of
it
xxv
but
they
deceive
themselves
in
dreaming
of
three
separate
individuals
each
of
them
possessing
a
part
of
the
divine
essence
we
teach
according
to
the
scriptures
that
there
is
essentially
but
one
god
and
therefore
that
the
essence
of
both
the
son
and
the
spirit
is
unbegotten
but
since
the
father
is
first
in
order
and
hath
of
himself
begotten
his
wisdom
therefore
as
has
before
been
observed
he
is
justly
esteemed
the
original
and
fountain
of
the
whole
divinity
thus
god
indefinitely
is
unbegotten
and
the
father
also
is
unbegotten
with
regard
to
his
person
they
even
foolishly
suppose
that
our
opinion
implies
a
quaternity
whereas
they
are
guilty
of
falsehood
and
calumny
in
ascribing
to
us
a
figment
of
their
own
as
though
we
pretended
that
the
three
persons
are
as
so
many
streams
proceeding
from
one
essence
when
it
is
evident
from
our
writings
that
we
separate
not
the
persons
from
the
essence
but
though
they
subsist
in
it
make
a
distinction
between
them
if
the
persons
were
separated
from
the
essence
there
would
perhaps
be
some
probability
in
their
argument
but
then
there
would
be
a
trinity
of
gods
not
a
trinity
of
persons
contained
in
one
god
this
solves
their
frivolous
question
whether
the
essence
concurs
to
the
formation
of
the
trinity
as
though
we
imagined
three
gods
to
descend
from
it
their
objection
that
then
the
trinity
would
be
without
god
is
equally
impertinent
because
though
it
concurs
not
to
the
distinction
as
a
part
or
member
yet
the
persons
are
not
independent
of
it
nor
separate
from
it
for
the
father
unless
he
were
god
could
not
be
the
father
and
the
son
is
the
son
only
as
he
is
god
therefore
we
say
that
the
deity
is
absolutely
whence
we
confess
also
that
the
son
as
god
independently
of
the
consideration
of
person
is
but
as
the
son
we
say
that
he
is
of
the
father
thus
his
essence
is
unoriginated
but
the
origin
of
his
person
is
god
himself
and
indeed
the
orthodox
writers
who
have
written
on
the
trinity
have
referred
this
name
only
to
the
persons
since
to
comprehend
the
essence
in
that
distinction
were
not
only
an
absurd
error
but
a
most
gross
impiety
for
it
is
evident
that
those
who
maintain
that
the
trinity
consists
in
a
union
of
the
essence
the
son
and
the
spirit
annihilate
the
essence
of
the
son
and
of
the
spirit
otherwise
the
parts
would
be
destroyed
by
being
confounded
together
which
is
a
fault
in
every
distinction
finally
if
the
words
and
were
the
father
were
the
author
of
the
would
be
left
in
the
son
but
a
mere
shadow
nor
would
the
trinity
be
any
other
than
a
conjunction
of
the
one
god
with
two
created
things
xxvi
their
objection
that
christ
if
he
be
properly
god
is
not
rightly
called
the
son
of
god
has
already
been
answered
for
when
a
comparison
is
made
between
one
person
and
another
the
word
is
not
used
indefinitely
but
is
restricted
to
the
father
as
being
the
fountain
of
the
deity
not
with
regard
to
the
essence
as
fanatics
falsely
pretend
but
in
respect
of
order
this
is
the
sense
in
which
we
ought
to
understand
that
declaration
of
christ
to
his
father
this
is
life
eternal
that
they
might
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
for
speaking
in
the
capacity
of
mediator
he
holds
an
intermediate
station
between
god
and
men
yet
without
any
diminution
of
his
majesty
for
although
he
abased
himself
yet
he
lost
not
his
glory
with
the
father
which
was
hidden
from
the
world
thus
the
apostle
to
the
hebrews
though
he
acknowledges
that
christ
was
made
for
a
short
time
inferior
to
the
angels
yet
nevertheless
hesitates
not
to
assert
that
he
is
the
eternal
god
who
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
we
must
remember
therefore
that
whenever
christ
in
the
capacity
of
mediator
addresses
the
father
he
comprehends
under
the
name
of
god
the
divinity
which
belongs
also
to
himself
thus
when
he
said
to
his
apostles
i
go
unto
the
father
for
my
father
is
greater
than
i
he
attributes
not
to
himself
a
secondary
divinity
as
if
he
were
inferior
to
the
father
with
respect
to
the
eternal
essence
but
because
having
obtained
the
glory
of
heaven
he
gathers
together
the
faithful
to
a
participation
of
it
with
him
he
represents
the
father
to
be
in
a
station
superior
to
himself
just
as
the
illustrious
perfection
of
the
splendour
which
appears
in
heaven
excels
that
degree
of
glory
which
was
visible
in
him
during
his
incarnate
state
for
the
same
reason
paul
says
in
another
place
that
christ
shall
deliver
up
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
father
that
god
may
be
all
in
nothing
would
be
more
absurd
than
to
deny
perpetual
duration
to
the
deity
of
christ
now
if
he
will
never
cease
to
be
the
son
of
god
but
will
remain
for
ever
the
same
as
he
has
been
from
the
beginning
it
follows
that
by
the
name
is
intended
the
one
sole
divine
essence
which
is
common
to
them
both
and
it
is
certain
that
christ
descended
to
us
in
order
that
exalting
us
to
the
father
he
might
at
the
same
time
exalt
us
to
himself
also
as
being
one
with
the
father
it
is
therefore
neither
lawful
nor
right
to
restrict
the
name
of
god
exclusively
to
the
father
and
to
deny
it
to
the
son
for
even
on
this
very
account
john
asserts
him
to
be
the
true
god
that
no
one
might
suppose
that
he
possessed
only
a
secondary
degree
of
deity
inferior
to
the
father
and
i
wonder
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
these
fabricators
of
new
gods
when
after
confessing
that
christ
is
the
true
god
they
immediately
exclude
him
from
the
deity
of
the
father
as
though
there
could
be
any
true
god
but
one
alone
or
as
though
a
transfused
divinity
were
any
thing
but
a
novel
fiction
xxvii
their
accumulation
of
numerous
passages
from
irenæus
where
he
asserts
the
father
of
christ
to
be
the
only
and
eternal
god
of
israel
is
a
proof
either
of
shameful
ignorance
or
of
consummate
wickedness
for
they
ought
to
have
considered
that
that
holy
man
was
then
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
some
madmen
who
denied
that
the
father
of
christ
was
the
same
god
that
has
spoken
by
moses
and
the
prophets
but
maintained
that
he
was
i
know
not
what
sort
of
phantasm
produced
from
the
corruption
of
the
world
his
only
object
therefore
is
to
show
that
no
other
god
is
revealed
in
the
scripture
than
the
father
of
christ
and
that
it
is
impious
to
imagine
any
other
and
therefore
we
need
not
wonder
at
his
frequently
concluding
that
there
never
was
any
other
god
of
israel
than
he
who
was
preached
by
christ
and
his
apostles
so
now
on
the
other
hand
when
a
different
error
is
to
be
opposed
we
shall
truly
assert
that
the
god
who
appeared
formerly
to
the
patriarchs
was
no
other
than
christ
if
it
be
objected
that
it
was
the
father
we
are
prepared
to
reply
that
while
we
contend
for
the
divinity
of
the
son
we
by
no
means
reject
that
of
the
father
if
the
reader
attends
to
this
design
of
irenæus
all
contention
will
cease
moreover
the
whole
controversy
is
easily
decided
by
the
sixth
chapter
of
the
third
book
where
the
good
man
insists
on
this
one
point
that
he
who
is
absolutely
and
indefinitely
called
god
in
the
scripture
is
the
only
true
god
but
that
the
name
of
god
is
given
absolutely
to
christ
let
us
remember
that
the
point
at
issue
as
appears
from
the
whole
treatise
and
particularly
from
the
chapter
of
the
second
book
was
this
that
the
appellation
of
father
is
not
given
in
an
enigmatical
and
parabolical
sense
to
one
who
is
not
truly
god
besides
in
another
place
he
contends
that
the
son
is
called
god
as
well
as
the
father
by
the
prophets
and
apostles
he
afterwards
states
how
christ
who
is
lord
and
king
and
god
and
judge
of
all
received
power
from
him
who
is
god
of
all
and
that
is
with
relation
to
the
subjection
in
which
he
was
humbled
even
to
the
death
of
the
cross
and
a
little
after
he
affirms
that
the
son
is
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
who
gave
the
law
by
the
hand
of
moses
and
appeared
to
the
patriarchs
now
if
any
one
pretends
that
irenæus
acknowledges
the
father
alone
as
the
god
of
israel
i
shall
reply
as
is
clearly
maintained
by
the
same
writer
that
christ
is
one
and
the
same
as
also
he
applies
to
him
the
prophecy
of
habakkuk
god
shall
come
from
the
to
the
same
purpose
is
what
we
find
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
fourth
book
therefore
christ
himself
is
with
the
father
the
god
of
the
and
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
same
book
he
states
that
abraham
believed
in
god
inasmuch
as
christ
is
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
and
the
only
god
xxviii
their
pretensions
to
the
sanction
of
tertullian
are
equally
unfounded
for
notwithstanding
the
occasional
harshness
and
obscurity
of
his
mode
of
expression
yet
he
unequivocally
teaches
the
substance
of
the
doctrine
which
we
are
defending
that
is
that
whereas
there
is
one
god
yet
by
dispensation
or
economy
there
is
his
word
that
there
is
but
one
god
in
the
unity
of
the
substance
but
that
the
unity
by
a
mysterious
dispensation
is
disposed
into
a
trinity
that
there
are
three
not
in
condition
but
in
degree
not
in
substance
but
in
form
not
in
power
but
in
order
he
says
indeed
that
he
maintains
the
son
to
be
second
to
the
father
but
he
applies
this
only
to
the
distinction
of
the
persons
he
says
somewhere
that
the
son
is
visible
but
after
having
stated
arguments
on
both
sides
he
concludes
that
as
the
word
he
is
invisible
lastly
his
assertion
that
the
father
is
designated
by
his
person
proves
him
to
be
at
the
greatest
distance
from
the
notion
which
we
are
refuting
and
though
he
acknowledges
no
other
god
than
the
father
yet
the
explanations
which
he
gives
in
the
immediate
context
show
that
he
speaks
not
to
the
exclusion
of
the
son
when
he
denies
the
existence
of
any
other
god
than
the
father
and
that
therefore
the
unity
of
divine
government
is
not
violated
by
the
distinction
of
persons
and
from
the
nature
and
design
of
his
argument
it
is
easy
to
gather
the
meaning
of
his
words
for
he
contends
in
opposition
to
praxeas
that
although
god
is
distinguished
into
three
persons
yet
neither
is
there
a
plurality
of
gods
nor
is
the
unity
divided
and
because
according
to
the
erroneous
notion
of
praxeas
christ
could
not
be
god
without
being
the
father
therefore
tertullian
bestows
so
much
labour
upon
the
distinction
his
calling
the
word
and
spirit
a
portion
of
the
whole
though
a
harsh
expression
yet
is
excusable
since
it
has
no
reference
to
the
substance
but
only
denotes
the
disposition
and
economy
which
belongs
solely
to
the
persons
according
to
the
testimony
of
tertullian
himself
hence
also
that
question
how
many
persons
suppose
you
that
there
are
o
most
perverse
praxeas
but
as
many
as
there
are
names
so
a
little
after
that
they
may
believe
the
father
and
the
son
both
in
their
names
and
these
arguments
i
conceive
will
suffice
to
refute
the
impudence
of
those
who
make
use
of
the
authority
of
tertullian
in
order
to
deceive
the
minds
of
the
simple
xxix
and
certainly
whoever
will
diligently
compare
the
writings
of
the
fathers
will
find
in
irenæus
nothing
different
from
what
was
advanced
by
others
who
succeeded
him
justin
martyr
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
he
agrees
with
us
in
every
point
they
may
object
that
the
father
of
christ
is
denominated
the
one
god
by
him
as
well
as
by
the
rest
the
same
is
asserted
also
by
hilary
and
even
in
harsher
terms
he
says
that
eternity
is
in
the
father
but
does
this
imply
a
denial
of
the
divine
essence
to
the
son
on
the
contrary
he
had
no
other
design
than
to
maintain
the
same
faith
which
we
hold
nevertheless
they
are
not
ashamed
to
cull
out
mutilated
passages
in
order
to
induce
a
belief
that
he
patronized
their
error
if
they
wish
any
authority
to
be
attached
to
their
quotation
of
ignatius
let
them
prove
that
the
apostles
delivered
any
law
concerning
lent
and
similar
corruptions
for
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
the
impertinencies
which
have
been
published
under
the
name
of
ignatius
wherefore
their
impudence
is
more
intolerable
who
disguise
themselves
under
such
false
colours
for
the
purpose
of
deception
moreover
the
consent
of
antiquity
manifestly
appears
from
this
circumstance
that
in
the
nicene
council
arius
never
dared
to
defend
himself
by
the
authority
of
any
approved
writer
and
not
one
of
the
greek
or
latin
fathers
who
were
there
united
against
him
excused
himself
as
at
all
dissenting
from
his
predecessors
with
regard
to
augustine
who
experienced
great
hostility
from
these
disturbers
his
diligent
examination
of
all
the
writings
of
the
earlier
fathers
and
his
respectful
attention
to
them
need
not
be
mentioned
if
he
differs
from
them
in
the
smallest
particulars
he
assigns
the
reasons
which
oblige
him
to
dissent
from
them
on
this
argument
also
if
he
finds
any
thing
ambiguous
or
obscure
in
others
he
never
conceals
it
yet
he
takes
it
for
granted
that
the
doctrine
which
those
men
oppose
has
been
received
without
controversy
from
the
remotest
antiquity
and
yet
that
he
was
not
uninformed
of
what
others
had
taught
before
him
appears
even
from
one
word
in
the
first
book
of
his
treatise
on
the
christian
doctrine
where
he
says
that
unity
is
in
the
father
will
they
pretend
that
he
had
then
forgotten
himself
but
he
elsewhere
vindicates
himself
from
this
calumny
where
he
calls
the
father
the
fountain
of
the
whole
deity
because
he
is
from
no
other
wisely
considering
that
the
name
of
god
is
especially
ascribed
to
the
father
because
unless
the
original
be
from
him
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
simple
unity
of
the
deity
these
observations
i
hope
will
be
approved
by
the
pious
reader
as
sufficient
to
refute
all
the
calumnies
with
which
satan
has
hitherto
laboured
to
pervert
or
obscure
the
purity
of
this
doctrine
finally
i
trust
that
the
whole
substance
of
this
doctrine
has
been
faithfully
stated
and
explained
provided
my
readers
set
bounds
to
their
curiosity
and
are
not
unreasonably
fond
of
tedious
and
intricate
controversies
for
i
have
not
the
least
expectation
of
giving
satisfaction
to
those
who
are
pleased
with
an
intemperance
of
speculation
i
am
sure
i
have
used
no
artifice
in
the
omission
of
any
thing
from
a
supposition
that
it
would
make
against
me
but
studying
the
edification
of
the
church
i
have
thought
it
better
not
to
touch
upon
many
things
which
would
be
unnecessarily
burdensome
to
the
reader
without
yielding
him
any
profit
for
to
what
purpose
is
it
to
dispute
whether
the
father
be
always
begetting
for
it
is
foolish
to
imagine
a
continual
act
of
generation
since
it
is
evident
that
three
persons
have
subsisted
in
god
from
all
eternity
chapter
xiv
the
true
god
clearly
distinguished
in
the
scripture
from
all
fictitious
ones
by
the
creation
of
the
world
although
isaiah
brings
a
just
accusation
of
stupidity
against
the
worshippers
of
fictitious
deities
for
not
having
learned
from
the
foundations
of
the
earth
and
the
circuit
of
the
heavens
who
was
the
true
god
yet
such
is
the
slowness
and
dulness
of
our
minds
as
to
induce
a
necessity
for
a
more
express
exhibition
of
the
true
god
lest
the
faithful
should
decline
to
the
fictions
of
the
heathen
for
since
the
most
tolerable
description
given
by
the
philosophers
that
god
is
the
soul
of
the
world
is
utterly
vain
and
worthless
we
require
a
more
familiar
knowledge
of
him
to
prevent
us
from
wavering
in
perpetual
uncertainty
therefore
he
hath
been
pleased
to
give
us
a
history
of
the
creation
on
which
the
faith
of
the
church
might
rest
without
seeking
after
any
other
god
than
him
whom
moses
has
represented
as
the
former
and
builder
of
the
world
the
first
thing
specified
in
this
history
is
the
time
that
by
a
continued
series
of
years
the
faithful
might
arrive
at
the
first
original
of
the
human
race
and
of
all
things
this
knowledge
is
eminently
useful
not
only
to
contradict
the
monstrous
fables
formerly
received
in
egypt
and
other
countries
but
also
to
give
us
clearer
views
of
the
eternity
of
god
and
to
fill
us
with
greater
admiration
of
it
nor
ought
we
to
be
moved
with
that
profane
sneer
that
it
is
marvellous
that
god
did
not
form
the
design
of
creating
heaven
and
earth
at
an
earlier
period
but
suffered
an
immeasurable
duration
to
pass
away
unemployed
since
he
could
have
made
them
many
thousands
of
ages
before
whereas
the
continuance
of
the
world
now
advancing
to
its
last
end
has
not
yet
reached
six
thousand
years
for
the
reason
why
god
deferred
it
so
long
it
would
be
neither
lawful
nor
expedient
to
inquire
because
if
the
human
mind
strive
to
penetrate
it
it
will
fail
a
hundred
times
in
the
attempt
nor
indeed
could
there
be
any
utility
in
the
knowledge
of
that
which
god
himself
in
order
to
prove
the
modesty
of
our
faith
has
purposely
concealed
great
shrewdness
was
discovered
by
a
certain
pious
old
man
who
when
some
scoffer
ludicrously
inquired
what
god
had
been
doing
before
the
creation
of
the
world
replied
that
he
had
been
making
hell
for
over
curious
men
this
admonition
no
less
grave
than
severe
should
repress
the
wantonness
which
stimulates
many
and
impels
them
to
perverse
and
injurious
speculations
lastly
let
us
remember
that
god
who
is
invisible
and
whose
wisdom
power
and
justice
are
incomprehensible
has
placed
before
us
the
history
of
moses
as
a
mirror
which
exhibits
his
lively
image
for
as
eyes
either
dim
through
age
or
dull
through
any
disease
see
nothing
distinctly
without
the
assistance
of
spectacles
so
in
our
inquiries
after
god
such
is
our
imbecility
without
the
guidance
of
the
scripture
we
immediately
lose
our
way
but
those
who
indulge
their
presumption
since
they
are
now
admonished
in
vain
will
perceive
too
late
by
their
horrible
destruction
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
look
up
to
the
secret
counsels
of
god
with
reverential
awe
than
to
disgorge
their
blasphemies
to
darken
the
heaven
augustine
justly
complains
that
it
is
an
offence
against
god
to
inquire
for
any
cause
of
things
higher
than
his
will
he
elsewhere
prudently
cautions
us
that
it
is
as
absurd
to
dispute
concerning
an
infinite
duration
of
time
as
concerning
an
infinite
extent
of
place
however
extensive
the
circuit
of
the
heavens
yet
certainly
it
has
some
dimensions
now
if
any
one
should
expostulate
with
god
that
the
vacuity
of
space
is
a
hundred
times
larger
would
not
such
arrogance
be
detested
by
all
pious
persons
the
same
madness
is
chargeable
on
those
who
censure
the
inaction
of
god
for
not
having
according
to
their
wishes
created
the
world
innumerable
ages
before
to
gratify
their
inordinate
curiosity
they
desire
to
pass
beyond
the
limits
of
the
world
as
though
in
the
very
ample
circumference
of
heaven
and
earth
we
were
not
surrounded
by
numerous
objects
capable
of
absorbing
all
our
senses
in
their
inestimable
splendour
as
though
in
the
course
of
six
thousand
years
god
had
not
given
us
lessons
sufficient
to
exercise
our
minds
in
assiduous
meditation
on
them
then
let
us
cheerfully
remain
within
these
barriers
with
which
god
has
been
pleased
to
circumscribe
us
and
as
it
were
to
confine
our
minds
that
they
might
not
be
wandering
in
the
boundless
regions
of
uncertain
conjecture
ii
to
the
same
purpose
is
the
narration
of
moses
that
the
work
of
god
was
completed
not
in
one
moment
but
in
six
days
for
by
this
circumstance
also
we
are
called
away
from
all
false
deities
to
the
only
true
god
who
distributed
his
work
into
six
days
that
it
might
not
be
tedious
to
us
to
occupy
the
whole
of
life
in
the
consideration
of
it
for
though
whithersoever
we
turn
our
eyes
they
are
constrained
to
behold
the
works
of
god
yet
we
see
how
transient
our
attention
is
and
if
we
are
touched
with
any
pious
reflections
how
soon
they
leave
us
again
here
also
human
reason
murmurs
as
though
such
progressive
works
were
inconsistent
with
the
power
of
deity
till
subdued
to
the
obedience
of
faith
it
learns
to
observe
that
rest
to
which
the
sanctification
of
the
seventh
day
invites
us
now
in
the
order
of
those
things
we
must
diligently
consider
the
paternal
love
of
god
towards
the
human
race
in
not
creating
adam
before
he
had
enriched
the
earth
with
an
abundant
supply
of
every
thing
conducive
to
his
happiness
for
had
he
placed
him
in
the
earth
while
it
remained
barren
and
vacant
had
he
given
him
life
before
there
was
any
light
he
would
have
appeared
not
very
attentive
to
his
benefit
now
when
he
has
regulated
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
the
stars
for
the
service
of
man
replenished
the
earth
the
air
and
the
waters
with
living
creatures
and
caused
the
earth
to
produce
an
abundance
of
all
kinds
of
fruits
sufficient
for
sustenance
he
acts
the
part
of
a
provident
and
sedulous
father
of
a
family
and
displays
his
wonderful
goodness
towards
us
if
the
reader
will
more
attentively
consider
with
himself
these
things
which
i
only
hint
at
as
i
proceed
he
will
be
convinced
that
moses
was
an
authentic
witness
and
herald
of
the
one
god
the
creator
of
the
world
i
pass
over
what
i
have
already
stated
that
he
not
only
speaks
of
the
mere
essence
of
god
but
also
exhibits
to
us
his
eternal
wisdom
and
his
spirit
in
order
that
we
may
not
dream
of
any
other
god
except
him
who
will
be
known
in
that
express
image
iii
but
before
i
begin
to
enlarge
on
the
nature
of
man
something
must
be
said
concerning
angels
because
though
moses
in
the
history
of
the
creation
accommodating
himself
to
the
ignorance
of
the
common
people
mentions
no
other
works
of
god
than
such
as
are
visible
to
our
eyes
yet
when
he
afterwards
introduces
angels
as
ministers
of
god
we
may
easily
conclude
that
he
is
their
creator
whom
they
obey
and
in
whose
service
they
are
employed
though
moses
therefore
speaking
in
a
popular
manner
does
not
in
the
beginning
of
his
writings
immediately
enumerate
the
angels
among
the
creatures
of
god
yet
nothing
forbids
our
here
making
a
plain
and
explicit
statement
of
those
things
which
the
scripture
teaches
in
other
places
because
if
we
desire
to
know
god
from
his
works
such
an
excellent
and
noble
specimen
should
by
no
means
be
omitted
besides
this
point
of
doctrine
is
very
necessary
for
the
confutation
of
many
errors
the
excellence
of
the
angelic
nature
has
so
dazzled
the
minds
of
many
that
they
have
supposed
them
to
be
injured
if
they
were
treated
as
mere
creatures
subject
to
the
government
of
one
god
hence
they
were
falsely
pretended
to
possess
a
kind
of
divinity
manichæus
has
also
arisen
with
the
sect
which
he
founded
who
imagined
to
himself
two
original
principles
god
and
the
devil
and
attributed
to
god
the
origin
of
all
good
things
but
referred
evil
natures
to
the
production
of
the
devil
if
our
minds
were
bewildered
in
this
wild
and
incoherent
system
we
should
not
leave
god
in
full
possession
of
his
glory
in
the
creation
of
the
world
for
since
nothing
is
more
peculiar
to
god
than
eternity
and
existence
does
not
the
ascription
of
this
to
the
devil
dignify
him
with
a
title
of
divinity
now
where
is
the
omnipotence
of
god
if
such
an
empire
be
conceded
to
the
devil
as
that
he
can
execute
whatever
he
pleases
notwithstanding
the
aversion
of
the
divine
will
or
opposition
of
the
divine
power
but
the
only
foundation
of
the
system
of
manichæus
that
it
is
unlawful
to
ascribe
to
a
good
god
the
creation
of
any
evil
thing
in
no
respect
affects
the
orthodox
faith
which
admits
not
that
any
thing
in
the
universe
is
evil
in
its
nature
since
neither
the
depravity
and
wickedness
of
men
and
devils
nor
the
sins
which
proceed
from
that
source
are
from
mere
nature
but
from
a
corruption
of
nature
nor
from
the
beginning
has
any
thing
existed
in
which
god
has
not
given
a
specimen
both
of
his
wisdom
and
of
his
justice
to
oppose
these
perverse
notions
it
is
necessary
to
raise
our
minds
higher
than
our
eyes
can
reach
and
it
is
very
probable
that
it
was
with
this
design
when
in
the
nicene
creed
god
is
called
the
creator
of
all
things
that
particular
mention
is
made
of
things
invisible
yet
it
shall
be
my
study
to
observe
the
limit
which
the
rule
of
piety
prescribes
lest
by
indulging
an
unprofitable
degree
of
speculation
i
should
lead
the
reader
astray
from
the
simplicity
of
the
faith
and
certainly
since
the
spirit
invariably
teaches
us
in
a
profitable
manner
but
with
regard
to
things
of
little
importance
to
edification
either
is
wholly
silent
or
but
lightly
and
cursorily
touches
on
them
is
also
our
duty
cheerfully
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
what
it
is
not
for
our
advantage
to
know
iv
since
angels
are
ministers
of
god
appointed
to
execute
his
commands
that
they
are
also
his
creatures
ought
to
be
admitted
without
controversy
and
does
it
not
betray
obstinacy
rather
than
diligence
to
raise
any
contention
concerning
the
time
or
the
order
in
which
they
were
created
moses
narrates
that
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
and
all
the
host
of
them
to
what
purpose
is
it
anxiously
to
inquire
on
what
day
besides
the
stars
and
the
planets
the
other
more
concealed
hosts
of
heaven
began
to
exist
not
to
be
too
prolix
let
us
remember
on
this
point
as
on
the
whole
doctrine
of
religion
to
observe
one
rule
of
modesty
and
sobriety
which
is
not
to
speak
or
think
or
even
desire
to
know
concerning
obscure
subjects
any
thing
beyond
the
information
given
us
in
the
divine
word
another
rule
to
be
followed
is
in
reading
the
scripture
continually
to
direct
our
attention
to
investigate
and
meditate
upon
things
conducive
to
edification
not
to
indulge
curiosity
or
the
study
of
things
unprofitable
and
since
the
lord
has
been
pleased
to
instruct
us
not
in
frivolous
questions
but
in
solid
piety
the
fear
of
his
name
true
confidence
and
the
duties
of
holiness
let
us
content
ourselves
with
that
knowledge
wherefore
if
we
wish
to
be
truly
wise
we
must
forsake
the
vain
imaginations
propagated
by
triflers
concerning
the
nature
orders
and
multitude
of
angels
i
know
that
these
things
are
embraced
by
many
persons
with
greater
avidity
and
dwelt
upon
with
more
pleasure
than
such
things
as
are
in
daily
use
but
if
it
be
not
irksome
to
be
the
disciples
of
christ
it
should
not
be
irksome
to
follow
that
method
which
he
has
prescribed
then
the
consequence
will
be
that
content
with
his
discipline
we
shall
not
only
leave
but
also
abhor
those
unprofitable
speculations
from
which
he
calls
us
away
no
man
can
deny
that
great
subtlety
and
acuteness
is
discovered
by
dionysius
whoever
he
was
in
many
parts
of
his
treatise
on
the
celestial
hierarchy
but
if
any
one
enters
into
a
critical
examination
of
it
he
will
find
the
greatest
part
of
it
to
be
mere
babbling
but
the
duty
of
a
theologian
is
not
to
please
the
ear
with
empty
sounds
but
to
confirm
the
conscience
by
teaching
things
which
are
true
certain
and
profitable
a
reader
of
that
book
would
suppose
that
the
author
was
a
man
descended
from
heaven
giving
an
account
of
things
that
he
had
not
learned
from
the
information
of
others
but
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
but
paul
who
was
caught
up
to
the
third
heaven
not
only
has
told
us
no
such
things
but
has
even
declared
that
it
is
not
lawful
for
men
to
utter
the
secret
things
which
he
had
seen
taking
our
leave
therefore
of
this
nugatory
wisdom
let
us
consider
from
the
simple
doctrine
of
the
scripture
what
the
lord
has
been
pleased
for
us
to
know
concerning
his
angels
we
are
frequently
informed
in
the
scripture
that
angels
are
celestial
spirits
whose
ministry
and
service
god
uses
for
the
execution
of
whatever
he
has
decreed
and
hence
this
name
is
given
to
them
because
god
employs
them
as
messengers
to
manifest
himself
to
men
other
appellations
also
by
which
they
are
distinguished
are
derived
from
a
similar
cause
they
are
called
hosts
because
as
they
surround
their
prince
aggrandizing
his
majesty
and
rendering
it
conspicuous
and
like
soldiers
are
ever
attentive
to
the
signal
of
their
leader
and
are
so
prepared
for
the
performance
of
his
commands
that
he
has
no
sooner
signified
his
will
than
they
are
ready
for
the
work
or
rather
are
actually
engaged
in
it
such
a
representation
of
the
throne
of
god
is
exhibited
in
the
magnificent
descriptions
of
the
prophets
but
particularly
of
daniel
where
he
says
when
god
had
ascended
the
seat
that
thousand
thousands
ministered
unto
him
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
stood
before
since
by
their
means
the
lord
wonderfully
exerts
and
declares
the
power
and
strength
of
his
hand
thence
they
are
denominated
powers
because
by
them
he
exercises
and
administers
his
government
in
the
world
therefore
they
are
called
sometimes
principalities
sometimes
powers
sometimes
dominions
lastly
because
the
glory
of
god
in
some
measure
resides
in
them
they
have
also
for
this
reason
the
appellation
of
thrones
although
on
this
last
name
i
would
affirm
nothing
because
a
different
interpretation
is
equally
or
even
more
suitable
but
omitting
this
name
the
holy
spirit
often
uses
the
former
ones
to
magnify
the
dignity
of
the
angelic
ministry
nor
indeed
is
it
right
that
no
honour
should
be
paid
to
those
instruments
by
whom
god
particularly
exhibits
the
presence
of
his
power
moreover
they
are
more
than
once
called
gods
because
in
their
ministry
as
in
a
mirror
they
give
us
an
imperfect
representation
of
divinity
though
i
am
pleased
with
the
interpretation
of
the
old
writers
on
those
passages
where
the
scripture
records
the
appearance
of
an
angel
of
god
to
abraham
jacob
moses
and
others
that
christ
was
that
angel
yet
frequently
where
mention
is
made
of
angels
in
general
this
name
is
given
to
them
nor
should
this
surprise
us
for
if
that
honour
be
given
to
princes
and
governors
because
in
the
performance
of
their
functions
they
are
vicegerents
of
god
the
supreme
king
and
judge
there
is
far
greater
reason
for
its
being
paid
to
angels
in
whom
the
splendour
of
the
divine
glory
is
far
more
abundantly
displayed
vi
but
the
scripture
principally
insists
on
what
might
conduce
most
to
our
consolation
and
the
confirmation
of
our
the
angels
are
the
dispensers
and
administrators
of
the
divine
beneficence
towards
us
and
therefore
it
informs
us
that
they
guard
our
safety
undertake
our
defence
direct
our
ways
and
exercise
a
constant
solicitude
that
no
evil
befall
us
the
declarations
are
universal
belonging
primarily
to
christ
the
head
of
the
church
and
then
to
all
the
faithful
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
they
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
hands
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
again
the
angel
of
the
lord
encampeth
round
about
them
that
fear
him
and
delivereth
in
these
passages
god
shows
that
he
delegates
to
his
angels
the
protection
of
those
whom
he
has
undertaken
to
preserve
accordingly
the
angel
of
the
lord
consoles
the
fugitive
hagar
and
commands
her
to
be
reconciled
to
her
mistress
abraham
promises
his
servant
that
an
angel
should
be
the
guide
of
his
journey
jacob
in
his
benediction
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
prays
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
by
whom
he
had
been
redeemed
from
all
evil
would
cause
them
to
prosper
thus
an
angel
was
appointed
to
protect
the
camp
of
the
israelites
and
whenever
it
pleased
god
to
deliver
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
he
raised
up
avengers
by
the
ministry
of
angels
and
finally
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
adducing
more
examples
angels
ministered
to
christ
and
attended
him
in
all
his
difficulties
they
announced
his
resurrection
to
the
women
and
his
glorious
advent
to
the
disciples
and
thus
in
the
discharge
of
their
office
as
our
protectors
they
contend
against
the
devil
and
all
our
enemies
and
execute
the
vengeance
of
god
on
those
who
molest
us
as
we
read
that
an
angel
of
god
to
deliver
jerusalem
from
a
siege
slew
a
hundred
and
thousand
men
in
the
camp
of
the
king
of
assyria
in
one
night
vii
but
whether
each
of
the
faithful
has
a
particular
angel
assigned
him
for
his
defence
i
can
not
venture
certainly
to
affirm
when
daniel
introduces
the
angel
of
the
persians
and
the
angel
of
the
greeks
he
clearly
signifies
that
certain
angels
are
appointed
to
preside
over
kingdoms
and
provinces
christ
also
when
he
says
that
the
angels
of
children
always
behold
the
face
of
the
father
suggests
that
there
are
certain
angels
who
are
charged
with
their
safety
but
i
know
not
whether
this
justifies
the
conclusion
that
every
one
of
them
has
his
particular
guardian
angel
of
this
indeed
we
may
be
certain
that
not
one
angel
only
has
the
care
of
every
one
of
us
but
that
they
all
with
one
consent
watch
for
our
salvation
for
it
is
said
of
all
the
angels
together
that
they
rejoice
more
over
one
sinner
turned
to
repentance
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
who
have
persevered
in
their
righteousness
of
more
than
one
angel
it
is
said
that
they
carried
the
soul
of
lazarus
into
the
bosom
of
abraham
nor
is
it
in
vain
that
elisha
shows
his
servant
so
many
fiery
chariots
which
were
peculiarly
assigned
to
him
for
his
protection
there
is
one
place
which
seems
clearer
than
the
rest
in
confirmation
of
this
point
for
when
peter
on
his
liberation
from
prison
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
the
brethren
were
assembled
as
they
could
not
suppose
it
to
be
peter
himself
they
said
it
was
his
angel
this
conclusion
seems
to
have
arisen
in
their
minds
from
the
common
opinion
that
each
of
the
faithful
has
his
guardian
angel
assigned
him
but
here
it
may
also
be
replied
that
nothing
prevents
this
being
understood
of
any
one
of
the
angels
to
whom
the
lord
might
have
committed
the
care
of
peter
on
that
occasion
and
who
yet
might
not
be
his
perpetual
guardian
as
it
is
vulgarly
imagined
that
every
person
has
two
angels
a
good
one
and
a
bad
one
according
to
the
heathen
notion
of
different
genii
but
it
is
not
worth
while
anxiously
to
investigate
what
it
little
concerns
us
to
know
for
if
any
one
be
not
satisfied
with
this
that
all
the
orders
of
the
celestial
army
watch
for
his
safety
i
see
not
what
advantage
he
can
derive
from
knowing
that
he
has
one
particular
angel
given
him
for
his
guardian
but
those
who
restrict
to
one
angel
the
care
which
god
exercises
over
every
one
of
us
do
a
great
injury
to
themselves
and
to
all
the
members
of
the
church
as
though
those
auxiliaries
had
been
promised
in
vain
who
by
surrounding
and
defending
us
on
all
sides
contribute
to
increase
our
courage
in
the
conflict
viii
let
those
who
venture
to
determine
concerning
the
multitude
and
orders
of
the
angels
examine
on
what
foundation
their
opinions
rest
michael
i
confess
is
called
in
daniel
the
great
prince
and
in
jude
the
and
paul
informs
us
that
it
will
be
an
archangel
who
with
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
shall
summon
men
to
judgment
but
who
from
these
passages
can
determine
the
degrees
of
honour
among
the
angels
distinguish
the
individuals
by
their
respective
titles
and
assign
to
every
one
his
place
and
station
for
the
two
names
which
are
found
in
the
scripture
michael
and
gabriel
and
the
third
if
you
wish
to
add
it
from
the
history
of
tobias
may
appear
from
their
significations
to
be
given
to
angels
on
account
of
our
infirmity
though
i
would
rather
leave
this
undetermined
with
respect
to
their
numbers
we
hear
from
the
mouth
of
christ
of
many
legions
from
daniel
of
many
myriads
the
servant
of
elisha
saw
many
chariots
and
their
being
said
to
encamp
round
about
them
that
fear
god
is
expressive
of
a
great
multitude
it
is
certain
that
spirits
have
no
form
and
yet
the
scripture
on
account
of
the
slender
capacity
of
our
minds
under
the
names
of
cherubim
and
seraphim
represents
angels
to
us
as
having
wings
to
prevent
our
doubting
that
they
will
always
attend
with
incredible
celerity
to
afford
us
assistance
as
soon
as
our
cases
require
it
as
though
the
lightning
darted
from
heaven
were
to
fly
to
us
with
its
accustomed
velocity
all
further
inquiries
on
both
these
points
we
should
consider
as
belonging
to
that
class
of
mysteries
the
full
revelation
of
which
is
deferred
to
the
last
day
wherefore
let
us
remember
that
we
ought
to
avoid
too
much
curiosity
of
research
and
presumption
of
language
ix
but
this
which
is
called
in
question
by
some
restless
men
must
be
received
as
a
certain
truth
that
angels
are
ministering
spirits
whose
service
god
uses
for
the
protection
of
his
people
and
by
whom
he
dispenses
his
benefits
among
mankind
and
executes
his
other
works
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
ancient
sadducees
indeed
that
the
term
signified
nothing
but
the
motions
which
god
inspires
into
men
or
those
specimens
which
he
gives
of
his
power
but
this
foolish
notion
is
repugnant
to
so
many
testimonies
of
scripture
that
it
is
surprising
how
such
gross
ignorance
could
have
been
tolerated
among
that
people
for
to
omit
the
places
before
cited
where
mention
is
made
of
thousands
and
legions
of
angels
where
joy
is
attributed
to
them
where
they
are
said
to
sustain
the
faithful
in
their
hands
to
carry
their
souls
into
rest
to
behold
the
face
of
the
father
and
the
like
are
others
which
most
clearly
evince
that
they
are
spirits
possessing
an
actual
existence
and
their
own
peculiar
nature
for
the
declarations
of
stephen
and
paul
the
law
was
given
by
the
hand
of
angels
and
of
christ
that
the
elect
after
the
resurrection
shall
be
like
angels
that
the
day
of
judgment
is
not
known
even
to
the
angels
that
he
then
will
come
with
his
holy
angels
tortured
must
necessarily
be
thus
understood
likewise
when
paul
charges
timothy
before
christ
and
the
elect
angels
to
keep
his
precepts
he
intends
not
unsubstantial
qualities
or
inspirations
but
real
spirits
nor
otherwise
is
there
any
meaning
in
what
we
read
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
that
christ
is
made
more
excellent
than
the
angels
that
the
world
is
not
subject
to
them
that
christ
assumed
not
their
nature
but
the
nature
of
man
unless
we
understand
that
there
are
happy
spirits
to
whom
these
comparisons
may
apply
and
the
author
of
the
same
epistle
explains
himself
where
he
places
angels
and
the
souls
of
the
faithful
together
in
the
kingdom
of
god
besides
we
have
already
quoted
that
the
angels
of
children
always
behold
the
face
of
god
that
we
are
always
defended
by
their
protection
that
they
rejoice
for
our
safety
that
they
admire
the
manifold
grace
of
god
in
the
church
and
are
subject
to
christ
as
their
head
the
same
truth
is
proved
by
their
having
so
often
appeared
to
the
patriarchs
in
the
form
of
men
conversed
with
them
and
been
entertained
by
them
and
christ
himself
on
account
of
the
preëminence
which
he
obtains
in
the
capacity
of
mediator
is
called
an
angel
i
have
thought
proper
cursorily
to
touch
on
this
point
in
order
to
fortify
the
simple
against
those
foolish
and
absurd
notions
which
were
disseminated
by
satan
many
ages
ago
and
are
frequently
springing
up
afresh
x
it
remains
for
us
to
encounter
the
superstition
which
generally
insinuates
itself
into
men
s
minds
when
angels
are
said
to
be
the
ministers
and
dispensers
of
all
our
blessings
for
human
reason
soon
falls
into
an
opinion
that
there
is
no
honour
that
ought
not
to
be
paid
to
them
thus
it
happens
that
what
belongs
solely
to
god
and
christ
is
transferred
to
them
thus
we
see
that
for
some
ages
past
the
glory
of
christ
has
in
many
ways
been
obscured
while
angels
have
been
loaded
with
extravagant
honours
without
the
authority
of
the
word
of
god
and
among
the
errors
which
we
combat
in
the
present
day
there
is
scarcely
one
more
ancient
than
this
for
even
paul
appears
to
have
had
a
great
controversy
with
some
who
exalted
angels
in
such
a
manner
as
almost
to
degrade
christ
to
an
inferior
station
hence
the
solicitude
with
which
he
maintains
in
the
epistle
to
the
colossians
not
only
that
christ
is
to
be
esteemed
above
angels
but
also
that
he
is
the
author
of
all
blessings
to
them
in
order
that
we
may
not
forsake
him
and
turn
to
them
who
are
not
even
sufficient
for
themselves
but
draw
from
the
same
fountain
as
we
do
since
the
splendour
of
the
divine
majesty
therefore
is
eminently
displayed
in
them
there
is
nothing
more
natural
than
for
us
to
fall
down
with
astonishment
in
adoration
of
them
and
to
attribute
every
thing
to
them
which
exclusively
belongs
to
god
even
john
in
the
revelation
confesses
this
to
have
happened
to
himself
but
adds
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
thus
answered
see
thou
do
it
not
i
am
thy
worship
xi
but
this
danger
we
shall
happily
avoid
if
we
consider
why
god
is
accustomed
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
faithful
and
to
communicate
the
gifts
of
his
beneficence
by
means
of
angels
rather
than
by
himself
to
manifest
his
own
power
without
their
intervention
he
certainly
does
this
not
from
necessity
as
though
he
were
unable
to
do
without
them
for
whenever
he
pleases
he
passes
them
by
and
performs
his
work
with
a
mere
nod
of
his
power
so
far
is
he
from
being
indebted
to
their
assistance
for
relieving
him
in
any
difficulty
this
therefore
conduces
to
the
consolation
of
our
imbecility
that
we
may
want
nothing
that
can
either
raise
our
minds
to
a
good
hope
or
confirm
them
in
security
this
one
thing
indeed
ought
to
be
more
than
sufficient
for
us
that
the
lord
declares
himself
to
be
our
protector
but
while
we
see
ourselves
encompassed
with
so
many
dangers
so
many
annoyances
such
various
kinds
of
enemies
is
our
weakness
and
frailty
that
we
may
sometimes
be
filled
with
terror
or
fall
into
despair
unless
the
lord
enables
us
according
to
our
capacity
to
discover
the
presence
of
his
grace
for
this
reason
he
promises
not
only
that
he
will
take
care
of
us
himself
but
also
that
we
shall
have
innumerable
to
whom
he
has
committed
the
charge
of
our
safety
and
that
as
long
as
we
are
surrounded
by
their
superintendence
and
protection
whatever
danger
may
threaten
we
are
placed
beyond
the
utmost
reach
of
evil
i
confess
indeed
that
it
is
wrong
for
us
after
that
simple
promise
of
the
protection
of
god
alone
still
to
be
looking
around
to
see
from
what
quarter
our
aid
may
come
but
since
the
lord
from
his
infinite
clemency
and
goodness
is
pleased
to
assist
this
our
weakness
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
neglect
this
great
favour
which
he
shows
us
we
have
an
example
of
this
in
the
servant
of
elisha
who
when
he
saw
that
the
mountain
was
besieged
by
an
army
of
syrians
and
that
no
way
of
escape
was
left
was
filled
with
consternation
as
though
himself
and
his
master
had
been
ruined
then
elisha
prayed
that
god
would
open
his
eyes
and
he
immediately
saw
the
mountain
full
of
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
that
is
of
a
multitude
of
angels
who
were
to
guard
him
and
the
prophet
encouraged
by
this
vision
he
came
to
himself
again
and
was
able
to
look
down
with
intrepidity
on
the
enemies
the
sight
of
whom
before
had
almost
deprived
him
of
life
xii
therefore
whatever
is
said
concerning
the
ministry
of
angels
let
us
direct
it
to
this
end
that
overcoming
all
diffidence
our
hope
in
god
may
be
more
firmly
established
for
the
lord
has
provided
these
guards
for
us
that
we
may
not
be
terrified
by
a
multitude
of
enemies
as
though
they
could
prevail
in
opposition
to
his
assistance
but
may
have
recourse
to
the
sentiment
expressed
by
elisha
there
are
more
for
us
than
against
how
preposterous
is
it
then
that
we
should
be
alienated
from
god
by
angels
who
are
appointed
for
this
very
purpose
to
testify
that
his
aid
is
more
especially
present
with
us
but
they
do
alienate
us
from
him
unless
they
lead
us
directly
to
him
to
regard
him
call
on
him
and
celebrate
him
as
our
only
helper
unless
they
are
considered
by
us
as
his
hands
which
apply
themselves
to
do
nothing
without
his
direction
unless
they
attach
us
to
christ
the
only
mediator
to
depend
entirely
on
him
to
lean
upon
him
to
aspire
to
him
and
to
rest
satisfied
in
him
for
what
is
described
in
the
vision
of
jacob
ought
to
be
firmly
fixed
in
our
minds
that
the
angels
descend
to
the
earth
to
men
and
ascend
from
earth
to
heaven
by
a
ladder
above
which
stands
the
lord
of
hosts
this
implies
that
it
is
only
through
the
intercession
of
christ
that
we
are
favoured
with
the
ministry
of
angels
as
he
himself
affirms
hereafter
ye
shall
see
heaven
open
and
the
angels
descending
upon
the
son
of
therefore
the
servant
of
abraham
having
been
commended
to
the
care
of
an
angel
does
not
therefore
invoke
him
for
his
aid
but
trusting
to
that
committal
pours
out
his
prayers
before
the
lord
and
entreats
him
to
display
his
mercy
towards
abraham
for
as
god
does
not
make
them
the
ministers
of
his
power
and
goodness
in
order
to
divide
his
glory
with
them
so
neither
does
he
promise
his
assistance
in
their
ministry
that
we
may
divide
our
confidence
between
them
and
him
let
us
take
our
leave
therefore
of
that
platonic
philosophy
which
seeks
access
to
god
by
means
of
angels
and
worships
them
in
order
to
render
him
more
propitious
to
us
which
superstitious
and
curious
men
have
endeavoured
from
the
beginning
and
even
to
this
day
persevere
in
attempting
to
introduce
into
our
religion
xiii
the
design
of
almost
every
thing
that
the
scripture
teaches
concerning
devils
is
that
we
may
be
careful
to
guard
against
their
insidious
machinations
and
may
provide
ourselves
with
such
weapons
as
are
sufficiently
firm
and
strong
to
repel
the
most
powerful
enemies
for
when
satan
is
called
the
god
and
prince
of
this
world
the
strong
man
armed
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
a
roaring
lion
these
descriptions
only
tend
to
make
us
more
cautious
and
vigilant
and
better
prepared
to
encounter
him
this
is
sometimes
signified
in
express
words
for
peter
after
having
said
that
the
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
walketh
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
immediately
subjoins
an
exhortation
to
resist
him
steadfast
in
the
and
paul
having
suggested
that
we
wrestle
not
against
flesh
and
blood
but
against
principalities
against
powers
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
world
against
spiritual
wickedness
immediately
commands
us
to
put
on
suitable
armour
for
so
great
and
so
perilous
a
conflict
wherefore
having
been
previously
warned
that
we
are
perpetually
threatened
by
an
enemy
and
an
enemy
desperately
bold
and
extremely
strong
skilled
in
every
artifice
indefatigable
in
diligence
and
celerity
abundantly
provided
with
all
kinds
of
weapons
and
most
expert
in
the
science
of
war
let
us
make
it
the
grand
object
of
our
attention
that
we
suffer
not
ourselves
to
be
oppressed
with
slothfulness
and
inactivity
but
on
the
contrary
arousing
and
collecting
all
our
courage
be
ready
for
a
vigorous
resistance
and
as
this
warfare
is
terminated
only
by
death
let
us
encourage
ourselves
to
perseverance
but
above
all
conscious
of
weakness
and
ignorance
let
us
implore
the
assistance
of
god
nor
attempt
any
thing
but
in
reliance
on
him
since
he
alone
can
supply
us
with
wisdom
and
strength
and
courage
and
armour
xiv
but
the
more
to
excite
and
urge
us
to
such
conduct
the
scripture
announces
that
there
are
not
one
or
two
or
a
few
enemies
but
great
armies
who
wage
war
against
us
for
even
mary
magdalene
is
said
to
have
been
delivered
from
seven
demons
by
whom
she
was
possessed
and
christ
declares
it
to
be
a
common
case
that
if
you
leave
the
place
open
for
the
of
a
demon
who
has
once
been
ejected
he
associates
with
himself
seven
spirits
more
wicked
still
and
returns
to
his
vacant
possession
indeed
one
man
is
said
to
have
been
possessed
by
a
whole
legion
by
these
passages
therefore
we
are
taught
that
we
have
to
contend
with
an
infinite
multitude
of
enemies
lest
despising
their
paucity
we
should
be
more
remiss
to
encounter
them
or
expecting
sometimes
an
intermission
of
hostility
should
indulge
ourselves
in
idleness
but
when
one
satan
or
devil
is
frequently
mentioned
in
the
singular
number
it
denotes
that
principality
of
wickedness
which
opposes
the
kingdom
of
righteousness
for
as
the
church
and
society
of
saints
have
christ
as
their
head
so
the
faction
of
the
impious
and
impiety
itself
are
represented
to
us
with
their
prince
who
exercises
the
supreme
power
among
them
which
is
the
meaning
of
that
sentence
depart
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
xv
it
also
ought
to
stimulate
us
to
a
perpetual
war
with
the
devil
that
he
is
every
where
called
god
s
adversary
and
ours
for
if
we
feel
the
concern
which
we
ought
to
feel
for
the
glory
of
god
we
shall
exert
all
our
power
against
him
who
attempts
the
extinction
of
it
if
we
are
animated
by
a
becoming
zeal
for
defending
the
kingdom
of
christ
we
must
necessarily
have
an
irreconcilable
war
with
him
who
conspires
its
ruin
on
the
other
hand
if
we
are
solicitous
for
our
salvation
we
ought
to
make
neither
peace
nor
truce
with
him
who
assiduously
plots
its
destruction
now
such
is
the
description
given
of
him
in
the
third
chapter
of
genesis
where
he
seduces
man
from
the
obedience
owed
by
him
to
god
so
that
he
at
once
robs
god
of
his
just
honour
and
precipitates
man
into
ruin
such
also
is
he
described
in
the
evangelists
where
he
is
called
an
enemy
and
said
to
sow
tares
in
order
to
corrupt
the
seed
of
eternal
life
in
short
the
testimony
of
christ
concerning
him
that
he
was
a
murderer
and
a
liar
from
the
beginning
we
find
verified
in
all
his
actions
for
he
opposes
divine
truth
with
lies
obscures
the
light
with
shades
of
darkness
involves
the
minds
of
men
in
errors
stirs
up
animosities
and
kindles
contentions
and
wars
all
for
the
purpose
of
subverting
the
kingdom
of
god
and
plunging
mankind
with
himself
into
eternal
destruction
whence
it
is
evident
that
he
is
naturally
depraved
vicious
malignant
and
mischievous
for
there
must
be
extreme
depravity
in
that
mind
which
is
bent
on
opposing
the
glory
of
god
and
the
salvation
of
men
and
this
is
suggested
by
john
in
his
epistle
when
he
says
that
he
sinneth
from
the
for
he
intends
that
he
is
the
author
conductor
and
principal
contriver
of
all
wickedness
and
iniquity
xvi
but
since
the
devil
was
created
by
god
we
must
remark
that
this
wickedness
which
we
attribute
to
his
nature
is
not
from
creation
but
from
corruption
for
whatever
evil
quality
he
has
he
has
acquired
by
his
defection
and
fall
and
of
this
the
scripture
apprizes
us
lest
believing
him
to
have
come
from
god
just
as
he
now
is
we
should
ascribe
to
god
himself
that
which
is
in
direct
opposition
to
him
for
this
reason
christ
declares
that
satan
when
he
speaketh
a
lie
speaketh
of
his
own
and
adds
the
because
he
abode
not
in
the
when
he
says
that
he
abode
not
in
the
truth
he
certainly
implies
that
he
had
once
been
in
it
and
when
he
calls
him
the
father
of
a
lie
he
precludes
his
imputing
to
god
the
depravity
of
his
nature
which
originated
wholly
from
himself
though
these
things
are
delivered
in
a
brief
and
rather
obscure
manner
yet
they
are
abundantly
sufficient
to
vindicate
the
majesty
of
god
from
every
calumny
and
what
does
it
concern
us
to
know
respecting
devils
either
more
particulars
or
for
any
other
purpose
some
persons
are
displeased
that
the
scripture
does
not
give
us
in
various
places
a
distinct
and
detailed
account
of
their
fall
with
its
cause
manner
time
and
nature
but
these
things
being
nothing
to
us
it
was
better
for
them
if
not
to
be
passed
over
in
total
silence
yet
certainly
to
be
touched
on
but
lightly
because
it
would
ill
comport
with
the
dignity
of
the
holy
spirit
to
feed
curiosity
with
vain
and
unprofitable
histories
and
we
perceive
it
to
have
been
the
design
of
the
lord
to
deliver
nothing
in
his
sacred
oracles
which
we
might
not
learn
to
our
edification
that
we
ourselves
therefore
may
not
dwell
upon
unprofitable
subjects
let
us
be
content
with
this
concise
information
respecting
the
nature
of
devils
that
at
their
creation
they
were
originally
angels
of
god
but
by
degenerating
have
ruined
themselves
and
become
the
instruments
of
perdition
to
others
this
being
useful
to
be
known
it
is
clearly
stated
by
peter
and
jude
god
say
they
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
and
kept
not
their
first
estate
but
left
their
own
and
paul
mentioning
the
elect
angels
without
doubt
tacitly
implies
that
there
are
reprobate
ones
xvii
the
discord
and
contention
which
we
say
satan
maintains
against
god
ought
to
be
understood
in
a
manner
consistent
with
a
firm
persuasion
that
he
can
do
nothing
without
god
s
will
and
consent
for
we
read
in
the
history
of
job
that
he
presented
himself
before
god
to
receive
his
commands
and
dared
not
to
undertake
any
enterprise
without
having
obtained
his
permission
thus
also
when
ahab
was
to
be
deceived
he
undertook
to
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
the
prophets
and
being
commissioned
by
god
he
performed
it
for
this
reason
he
is
also
called
the
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
who
tormented
saul
because
he
was
employed
as
a
scourge
to
punish
the
sins
of
that
impious
monarch
and
elsewhere
it
is
recorded
that
the
plagues
were
inflicted
on
the
egyptians
by
the
evil
according
to
these
particular
examples
paul
declares
generally
that
the
blinding
of
unbelievers
is
the
work
of
god
whereas
he
had
before
called
it
the
operation
of
satan
it
appears
then
that
satan
is
subject
to
the
power
of
god
and
so
governed
by
his
control
that
he
is
compelled
to
render
obedience
to
him
now
when
we
say
that
satan
resists
god
and
that
his
works
are
contrary
to
the
works
of
god
we
at
the
same
time
assert
that
this
repugnance
and
contention
depend
on
the
divine
permission
i
speak
now
not
of
the
will
or
the
endeavour
but
only
of
the
effect
for
the
devil
being
naturally
wicked
has
not
the
least
inclination
towards
obedience
to
the
divine
will
but
is
wholly
bent
on
insolence
and
rebellion
it
therefore
arises
from
himself
and
his
wickedness
that
he
opposes
god
with
all
his
desires
and
purposes
this
depravity
stimulates
him
to
attempt
those
things
which
he
thinks
the
most
opposed
to
god
but
since
god
holds
him
tied
and
bound
with
the
bridle
of
his
power
he
executes
only
those
things
which
are
divinely
permitted
and
thus
whether
he
will
or
not
he
obeys
his
creator
being
constrained
to
fulfil
any
service
to
which
he
impels
him
xviii
while
god
directs
the
courses
of
unclean
spirits
hither
and
thither
at
his
pleasure
he
regulates
this
government
in
such
a
manner
that
they
exercise
the
faithful
with
fighting
attack
them
in
ambuscades
harass
them
with
incursions
push
them
in
battles
and
frequently
fatigue
them
throw
them
into
confusion
terrify
them
and
sometimes
wound
them
yet
never
conquer
or
overwhelm
them
but
subdue
and
lead
captive
the
impious
tyrannize
over
their
souls
and
bodies
and
abuse
them
like
slaves
by
employing
them
in
the
perpetration
of
every
enormity
the
faithful
in
consequence
of
being
harassed
by
such
enemies
are
addressed
with
the
following
and
other
similar
exhortations
give
not
place
to
the
your
adversary
the
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
walketh
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
whom
resist
steadfast
in
the
paul
confesses
that
he
himself
was
not
free
from
this
kind
of
warfare
when
he
declares
that
as
a
remedy
to
subdue
pride
the
messenger
of
satan
was
given
to
him
to
buffet
this
exercise
then
is
common
to
all
the
children
of
god
but
as
the
promise
respecting
the
breaking
of
the
head
of
satan
belongs
to
christ
and
all
his
members
in
common
i
therefore
deny
that
the
faithful
can
ever
be
conquered
or
overwhelmed
by
him
they
are
frequently
filled
with
consternation
but
recover
themselves
again
they
fall
by
the
violence
of
his
blows
but
are
raised
up
again
they
are
wounded
but
not
mortally
finally
they
labour
through
their
whole
lives
in
such
a
manner
as
at
last
to
obtain
the
victory
this
however
is
not
to
be
restricted
to
each
single
action
for
we
know
that
by
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
david
was
for
a
time
delivered
to
satan
that
by
his
instigation
he
might
number
the
people
nor
is
it
without
reason
that
paul
admits
a
hope
of
pardon
even
for
those
who
may
have
been
entangled
in
the
snares
of
the
devil
therefore
the
same
apostle
shows
in
another
place
that
the
promise
before
cited
is
begun
in
this
life
where
we
must
engage
in
the
conflict
and
that
after
the
termination
of
the
conflict
it
will
be
completed
and
the
god
of
peace
he
says
shall
bruise
satan
under
your
feet
in
our
head
this
victory
indeed
has
always
been
complete
because
the
prince
of
this
world
had
nothing
in
him
in
us
who
are
his
members
it
yet
appears
only
in
part
but
will
be
completed
when
we
shall
have
put
off
our
flesh
which
makes
us
still
subject
to
infirmities
and
shall
be
full
of
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
in
this
manner
when
the
kingdom
of
christ
is
erected
satan
and
his
power
must
fall
as
the
lord
himself
says
i
beheld
satan
as
lightning
falling
from
for
by
this
answer
he
confirms
what
the
apostles
had
reported
concerning
the
power
of
his
preaching
again
when
a
strong
man
armed
keepeth
his
palace
his
goods
are
in
peace
but
when
a
stronger
than
he
shall
come
upon
him
and
overcome
him
and
to
this
end
christ
by
his
death
overcame
satan
who
had
the
power
of
death
and
triumphed
over
all
his
forces
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
hurt
the
church
for
otherwise
it
would
be
in
hourly
danger
of
destruction
for
such
is
our
imbecility
and
such
the
strength
of
his
fury
how
could
we
stand
even
for
a
moment
against
his
various
and
unceasing
attacks
without
being
supported
by
the
victory
of
our
captain
therefore
god
permits
not
satan
to
exercise
any
power
over
the
souls
of
the
faithful
but
abandons
to
his
government
only
the
impious
and
unbelieving
whom
he
designs
not
to
number
among
his
own
flock
for
he
is
said
to
have
the
undisturbed
possession
of
this
world
till
he
is
expelled
by
christ
he
is
said
also
to
blind
all
who
believe
not
the
gospel
and
to
work
in
the
children
of
disobedience
and
this
justly
for
all
the
impious
are
vessels
of
wrath
to
whom
therefore
should
they
be
subjected
but
to
the
minister
of
the
divine
vengeance
finally
they
are
said
to
be
of
their
father
the
devil
because
as
the
faithful
are
known
to
be
the
children
of
god
from
their
bearing
his
image
so
the
impious
from
the
image
of
satan
into
which
they
have
degenerated
are
properly
considered
as
his
children
xix
but
as
we
have
already
confuted
that
nugatory
philosophy
concerning
the
holy
angels
which
teaches
that
they
are
nothing
but
inspirations
or
good
motions
excited
by
god
in
the
minds
of
men
so
in
this
place
we
must
refute
those
who
pretend
that
devils
are
nothing
but
evil
affections
or
perturbations
which
our
flesh
obtrudes
on
our
minds
but
this
may
be
easily
done
and
that
because
the
testimonies
of
scripture
on
this
subject
are
numerous
and
clear
first
when
they
are
called
unclean
spirits
and
apostate
angels
who
have
degenerated
from
their
original
condition
the
very
names
sufficiently
express
not
mental
emotions
or
affections
but
rather
in
reality
what
are
called
minds
or
spirits
endued
with
perception
and
intelligence
likewise
when
the
children
of
god
are
compared
with
the
children
of
the
devil
both
by
christ
and
by
john
would
not
the
comparison
be
absurd
if
nothing
were
intended
by
the
word
but
evil
inspirations
and
john
adds
something
still
plainer
that
the
devil
sins
from
the
beginning
likewise
when
jude
introduces
michael
the
archangel
contending
with
the
devil
he
certainly
opposes
to
the
good
angel
an
evil
and
rebellious
one
to
which
agrees
what
is
recorded
in
the
history
of
job
that
satan
appeared
with
the
holy
angels
before
god
but
the
clearest
of
all
are
those
passages
which
mention
the
punishment
which
they
begin
to
feel
from
the
judgment
of
god
and
are
to
feel
much
more
at
the
resurrection
thou
son
of
god
art
thou
come
hither
to
torment
us
before
the
time
also
depart
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
again
if
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment
how
unmeaning
were
these
expressions
that
the
devils
are
appointed
to
eternal
judgment
that
fire
is
prepared
for
them
that
they
are
now
tormented
and
vexed
by
the
glory
of
christ
if
there
were
no
devils
at
all
but
since
this
point
is
not
a
subject
of
dispute
with
those
who
give
credit
to
the
word
of
the
lord
but
with
those
vain
speculators
who
are
pleased
with
nothing
but
novelty
little
good
can
be
effected
by
testimonies
of
scripture
i
consider
myself
as
having
done
what
i
intended
which
was
to
fortify
the
pious
mind
against
such
a
species
of
errors
with
which
restless
men
disturb
themselves
and
others
that
are
more
simple
but
it
was
requisite
to
touch
on
it
lest
any
persons
involved
in
that
error
under
a
supposition
that
they
have
no
adversary
should
become
more
slothful
and
incautious
to
resist
him
xx
yet
let
us
not
disdain
to
receive
a
pious
delight
from
the
works
of
god
which
every
where
present
themselves
to
view
in
this
very
beautiful
theatre
of
the
world
for
this
as
i
have
elsewhere
observed
though
not
the
principal
is
yet
in
the
order
of
nature
the
first
lesson
of
faith
to
remember
that
whithersoever
we
turn
our
eyes
all
the
things
which
we
behold
are
the
works
of
god
and
at
the
same
time
to
consider
with
pious
meditation
for
what
end
god
created
them
therefore
to
apprehend
by
a
true
faith
what
it
is
for
our
benefit
to
know
concerning
god
we
must
first
of
all
understand
the
history
of
the
creation
of
the
world
as
it
is
briefly
related
by
moses
and
afterwards
more
copiously
illustrated
by
holy
men
particularly
by
basil
and
ambrose
thence
we
shall
learn
that
god
by
the
power
of
his
word
and
spirit
created
out
of
nothing
the
heaven
and
the
earth
that
from
them
he
produced
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
distinguished
by
an
admirable
gradation
the
innumerable
variety
of
things
to
every
species
gave
its
proper
nature
assigned
its
offices
and
appointed
its
places
and
stations
and
since
all
things
are
subject
to
corruption
has
nevertheless
provided
for
the
preservation
of
every
species
till
the
last
day
that
he
therefore
nourishes
some
by
methods
concealed
from
us
from
time
to
time
infusing
as
it
were
new
vigour
into
them
that
on
some
he
has
conferred
the
power
of
propagation
in
order
that
the
whole
species
may
not
be
extinct
at
their
death
that
he
has
thus
wonderfully
adorned
heaven
and
earth
with
the
utmost
possible
abundance
variety
and
beauty
like
a
large
and
splendid
mansion
most
exquisitely
and
copiously
furnished
lastly
that
by
creating
man
and
distinguishing
him
with
such
splendid
beauty
and
with
such
numerous
and
great
privileges
he
has
exhibited
in
him
a
most
excellent
specimen
of
all
his
works
but
since
it
is
not
my
design
to
treat
at
large
of
the
creation
of
the
world
let
it
suffice
to
have
again
dropped
these
few
hints
by
the
way
for
it
is
better
as
i
have
just
advised
the
reader
to
seek
for
fuller
information
on
this
subject
from
moses
and
others
who
have
faithfully
and
diligently
recorded
the
history
of
the
world
xxi
it
is
useless
to
enter
into
a
prolix
disputation
respecting
the
right
tendency
and
legitimate
design
of
a
consideration
of
the
works
of
god
since
this
question
has
been
in
a
great
measure
determined
in
another
place
and
as
much
as
concerns
our
present
purpose
may
be
despatched
in
few
words
indeed
if
we
wished
to
explain
how
the
inestimable
wisdom
power
justice
and
goodness
of
god
are
manifested
in
the
formation
of
the
world
no
splendour
or
ornament
of
diction
will
equal
the
magnitude
of
so
great
a
subject
and
it
is
undoubtedly
the
will
of
the
lord
that
we
should
be
continually
employed
in
this
holy
meditation
that
while
we
contemplate
in
all
the
creatures
as
in
so
many
mirrors
the
infinite
riches
of
his
wisdom
justice
goodness
and
power
we
might
not
only
take
a
transient
and
cursory
view
of
them
but
might
long
dwell
on
the
idea
seriously
and
faithfully
revolve
it
in
our
minds
and
frequently
recall
it
to
our
memory
but
this
being
a
didactic
treatise
we
must
omit
those
topics
which
require
long
declamations
to
be
brief
therefore
let
the
readers
know
that
they
have
then
truly
apprehended
by
faith
what
is
meant
by
god
being
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
if
they
in
the
first
place
follow
this
universal
rule
not
to
pass
over
with
ungrateful
inattention
or
oblivion
those
glorious
perfections
which
god
manifests
in
his
creatures
and
secondly
learn
to
make
such
an
application
to
themselves
as
thoroughly
to
affect
their
hearts
the
first
point
is
exemplified
when
we
consider
how
great
must
have
been
the
artist
who
disposed
that
multitude
of
stars
which
adorn
the
heaven
in
such
a
regular
order
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
thing
more
beautiful
to
behold
who
fixed
some
in
their
stations
so
that
they
can
not
be
moved
who
granted
to
others
a
freer
course
but
so
that
they
never
travel
beyond
their
appointed
limits
who
so
regulates
the
motions
of
all
that
they
measure
days
and
nights
months
years
and
seasons
of
the
year
and
also
reduces
the
inequality
of
days
which
we
constantly
witness
to
such
a
medium
that
it
occasions
no
confusion
so
also
when
we
observe
his
power
in
sustaining
so
great
a
mass
in
governing
the
rapid
revolutions
of
the
celestial
machine
and
the
like
for
these
few
examples
sufficiently
declare
what
it
is
to
recognize
the
perfections
of
god
in
the
creation
of
the
world
otherwise
were
i
desirous
of
pursuing
the
subject
to
its
full
extent
there
would
be
no
end
since
there
are
as
many
miracles
of
divine
power
as
many
monuments
of
divine
goodness
as
many
proofs
of
divine
wisdom
as
there
are
species
of
things
in
the
world
and
even
as
there
are
individual
things
either
great
or
small
xxii
there
remains
the
other
point
which
approaches
more
nearly
to
faith
that
while
we
observe
how
god
has
appointed
all
things
for
our
benefit
and
safety
and
at
the
same
time
perceive
his
power
and
grace
in
ourselves
and
the
great
benefits
which
he
has
conferred
on
us
we
may
thence
excite
ourselves
to
confide
in
him
to
invoke
him
to
praise
him
and
to
love
him
now
as
i
have
just
before
suggested
god
himself
has
demonstrated
by
the
very
order
of
creation
that
he
made
all
things
for
the
sake
of
man
for
it
was
not
without
reason
that
he
distributed
the
making
of
the
world
into
six
days
though
it
would
have
been
no
more
difficult
for
him
to
complete
the
whole
work
in
all
its
parts
at
once
in
a
single
moment
than
to
arrive
at
its
completion
by
such
progressive
advances
but
in
this
he
has
been
pleased
to
display
his
providence
and
paternal
solicitude
towards
us
since
before
he
would
make
man
he
prepared
every
thing
which
he
foresaw
would
be
useful
or
beneficial
to
him
how
great
would
be
now
the
ingratitude
to
doubt
whether
we
are
regarded
by
this
best
of
fathers
whom
we
perceive
to
have
been
solicitous
on
our
account
before
we
existed
how
impious
would
it
be
to
tremble
with
diffidence
lest
at
any
time
his
benignity
should
desert
us
in
our
necessities
which
we
see
was
displayed
in
the
greatest
affluence
of
all
blessings
provided
for
us
while
we
were
yet
unborn
besides
we
are
told
by
moses
that
his
liberality
has
subjected
to
us
all
that
is
contained
in
the
whole
world
he
certainly
has
not
made
this
declaration
in
order
to
tantalize
us
with
the
empty
name
of
such
a
donation
therefore
we
never
shall
be
destitute
of
any
thing
which
will
conduce
to
our
welfare
finally
to
conclude
whenever
we
call
god
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
let
us
at
the
same
time
reflect
that
the
dispensation
of
all
those
things
which
he
has
made
is
in
his
own
power
and
that
we
are
his
children
whom
he
has
received
into
his
charge
and
custody
to
be
supported
and
educated
so
that
we
may
expect
every
blessing
from
him
alone
and
cherish
a
certain
hope
that
he
will
never
suffer
us
to
want
those
things
which
are
necessary
to
our
that
our
hope
may
depend
on
no
other
that
whatever
we
need
or
desire
our
prayers
may
be
directed
to
him
and
that
from
whatever
quarter
we
receive
any
advantage
we
may
acknowledge
it
to
be
his
benefit
and
confess
it
with
thanksgiving
that
being
allured
with
such
great
sweetness
of
goodness
and
beneficence
we
may
study
to
love
and
worship
him
with
all
our
hearts
chapter
xv
the
state
of
man
at
his
creation
the
faculties
of
the
soul
the
divine
image
free
will
and
the
original
purity
of
his
nature
we
must
now
treat
of
the
creation
of
man
not
only
because
he
exhibits
the
most
noble
and
remarkable
specimen
of
the
divine
justice
wisdom
and
goodness
among
all
the
works
of
god
but
because
as
we
observed
in
the
beginning
we
can
not
attain
to
a
clear
and
solid
knowledge
of
god
without
a
mutual
acquaintance
with
ourselves
but
though
this
is
twofold
knowledge
of
the
condition
in
which
we
were
originally
created
and
of
that
into
which
we
entered
after
the
fall
of
adam
for
indeed
we
should
derive
but
little
advantage
from
a
knowledge
of
our
creation
unless
in
the
lamentable
ruin
which
has
befallen
us
we
discovered
the
corruption
and
deformity
of
our
nature
we
shall
content
ourselves
at
present
with
a
description
of
human
nature
in
its
primitive
integrity
and
indeed
before
we
proceed
to
the
miserable
condition
in
which
man
is
now
involved
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
state
in
which
he
was
first
created
for
we
must
beware
lest
in
precisely
pointing
out
the
natural
evils
of
man
we
seem
to
refer
them
to
the
author
of
nature
since
impious
men
suppose
that
this
pretext
affords
them
a
sufficient
defence
if
they
can
plead
that
whatever
defect
or
fault
they
have
proceeds
in
some
measure
from
god
nor
do
they
hesitate
if
reproved
to
litigate
with
god
himself
and
transfer
to
him
the
crime
of
which
they
are
justly
accused
and
those
who
would
be
thought
to
speak
with
more
reverence
concerning
the
deity
yet
readily
endeavour
to
excuse
their
depravity
from
nature
not
considering
that
they
also
though
in
a
more
obscure
manner
are
guilty
of
defaming
the
character
of
god
to
whose
dishonour
it
would
redound
if
nature
could
be
proved
to
have
had
any
innate
depravity
at
its
formation
since
we
see
the
flesh
therefore
eagerly
catching
at
every
subterfuge
by
which
it
supposes
that
the
blame
of
its
evils
may
by
any
means
be
transferred
from
itself
to
any
other
we
must
diligently
oppose
this
perverseness
the
calamity
of
mankind
must
be
treated
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preclude
all
tergiversation
and
to
vindicate
the
divine
justice
from
every
accusation
we
shall
afterwards
in
the
proper
place
see
how
far
men
are
fallen
from
that
purity
which
was
bestowed
upon
adam
and
first
let
it
be
understood
that
by
his
being
made
of
earth
and
clay
a
restraint
was
laid
upon
pride
since
nothing
is
more
absurd
than
for
creatures
to
glory
in
their
excellence
who
not
only
inhabit
a
cottage
of
clay
but
who
are
themselves
composed
partly
of
dust
and
ashes
but
as
god
not
only
deigned
to
animate
the
earthen
vessel
but
chose
to
make
it
the
residence
of
an
immortal
spirit
adam
might
justly
glory
in
so
great
an
instance
of
the
liberality
of
his
maker
ii
that
man
consists
of
soul
and
body
ought
not
to
be
controverted
by
the
soul
i
understand
an
immortal
yet
created
essence
which
is
the
nobler
part
of
him
sometimes
it
is
called
a
spirit
for
though
when
these
names
are
connected
they
have
a
different
signification
yet
when
spirit
is
used
separately
it
means
the
same
as
soul
as
when
solomon
speaking
of
death
says
that
then
the
spirit
shall
return
unto
god
who
gave
and
christ
commending
his
spirit
to
the
father
and
stephen
his
to
christ
intend
no
other
than
that
when
the
soul
is
liberated
from
the
prison
of
the
flesh
god
is
its
perpetual
keeper
those
who
imagine
that
the
soul
is
called
a
spirit
because
it
is
a
breath
or
faculty
divinely
infused
into
the
body
but
destitute
of
any
essence
are
proved
to
be
in
a
gross
error
by
the
thing
itself
and
by
the
whole
tenor
of
scripture
it
is
true
indeed
that
while
men
are
immoderately
attached
to
the
earth
they
become
stupid
and
being
alienated
from
the
father
of
lights
are
immersed
in
darkness
so
that
they
consider
not
that
they
shall
survive
after
death
yet
in
the
mean
time
the
light
is
not
so
entirely
extinguished
by
the
darkness
but
that
they
are
affected
with
some
sense
of
their
immortality
surely
the
conscience
which
discerning
between
good
and
evil
answers
to
the
judgment
of
god
is
an
indubitable
proof
of
an
immortal
spirit
for
how
could
an
affection
or
emotion
without
any
essence
penetrate
to
the
tribunal
of
god
and
inspire
itself
with
terror
on
account
of
its
guilt
for
the
body
is
not
affected
by
a
fear
of
spiritual
punishment
that
falls
only
on
the
soul
whence
it
follows
that
it
is
possessed
of
an
essence
now
the
very
knowledge
of
god
sufficiently
proves
the
immortality
of
the
soul
which
rises
above
the
world
since
an
evanescent
breath
or
inspiration
could
not
arrive
at
the
fountain
of
life
lastly
the
many
noble
faculties
with
which
the
human
mind
is
adorned
and
which
loudly
proclaim
that
something
divine
is
inscribed
on
it
are
so
many
testimonies
of
its
immortal
essence
for
the
sense
which
the
brutes
have
extends
not
beyond
the
body
or
at
most
not
beyond
the
objects
near
it
but
the
agility
of
the
human
mind
looking
through
heaven
and
earth
and
the
secrets
of
nature
and
comprehending
in
its
intellect
and
memory
all
ages
digesting
every
thing
in
proper
order
and
concluding
future
events
from
those
which
are
past
clearly
demonstrates
that
there
is
concealed
within
man
something
distinct
from
the
body
in
our
minds
we
form
conceptions
of
the
invisible
god
and
of
angels
to
which
the
body
is
not
at
all
competent
we
apprehend
what
is
right
just
and
honest
which
is
concealed
from
the
corporeal
senses
the
spirit
therefore
must
be
the
seat
of
this
intelligence
even
sleep
itself
which
stupefying
man
seems
to
divest
him
even
of
life
is
no
obscure
proof
of
immortality
since
it
not
only
suggests
to
us
ideas
of
things
which
never
happened
but
also
presages
of
future
events
i
briefly
touch
those
things
which
even
profane
writers
magnificently
extol
in
a
more
splendid
and
ornamented
diction
but
with
the
pious
reader
the
simple
mention
of
them
will
be
sufficient
now
unless
the
soul
were
something
essentially
distinct
from
the
body
the
scripture
would
not
inform
us
that
we
dwell
in
houses
of
clay
and
at
death
quit
the
tabernacle
of
the
flesh
that
we
put
off
the
corruptible
to
receive
a
reward
at
the
last
day
according
to
the
respective
conduct
of
each
individual
in
the
body
for
certainly
these
and
similar
passages
which
often
occur
not
only
manifestly
distinguish
the
soul
from
the
body
but
by
transferring
to
it
the
name
of
man
indicate
that
it
is
the
principal
part
of
our
nature
when
paul
exhorts
the
faithful
to
cleanse
themselves
from
all
filthiness
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
spirit
he
points
out
two
parts
in
which
the
defilement
of
sin
resides
peter
also
when
he
called
christ
the
shepherd
and
bishop
of
souls
would
have
spoken
improperly
if
there
were
no
souls
over
whom
he
could
exercise
that
office
nor
would
there
be
any
consistency
in
what
he
says
concerning
the
eternal
salvation
of
souls
or
in
his
injunction
to
purify
the
souls
or
in
his
assertion
that
fleshly
lusts
war
against
the
soul
or
in
what
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
says
that
pastors
watch
to
give
an
account
of
our
souls
unless
souls
had
a
proper
essence
to
the
same
purpose
is
the
place
where
paul
calls
god
for
a
record
upon
his
soul
because
it
could
not
be
amenable
to
god
if
it
were
not
capable
of
punishment
which
is
also
more
clearly
expressed
in
the
words
of
christ
where
he
commands
us
to
fear
him
who
after
having
killed
the
body
is
able
to
cast
the
soul
into
hell
where
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
distinguishes
between
the
fathers
of
our
flesh
and
god
who
is
the
only
father
of
spirits
he
could
not
assert
the
essence
or
existence
of
the
soul
in
more
express
terms
besides
unless
the
soul
survived
after
its
liberation
from
the
prison
of
the
body
it
was
absurd
for
christ
to
represent
the
soul
of
lazarus
as
enjoying
happiness
in
the
bosom
of
abraham
and
the
soul
of
the
rich
man
as
condemned
to
dreadful
torments
paul
confirms
the
same
point
by
informing
us
that
we
are
absent
from
god
as
long
as
we
dwell
in
the
body
but
that
when
absent
from
the
body
we
are
present
with
the
lord
not
to
be
too
prolix
on
a
subject
of
so
little
obscurity
i
shall
only
add
this
from
luke
that
it
is
reckoned
among
the
errors
of
the
sadducees
that
they
believed
not
the
existence
of
angels
or
of
spirits
iii
a
solid
proof
of
this
point
may
also
be
gathered
from
man
being
said
to
be
created
in
the
image
of
god
for
though
the
glory
of
god
is
displayed
in
his
external
form
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
proper
seat
of
his
image
is
in
the
soul
i
admit
that
external
form
as
it
distinguishes
us
from
brutes
also
exalts
us
more
nearly
to
god
nor
will
i
too
vehemently
contend
with
any
one
who
would
understand
by
the
image
of
god
that
while
the
mute
creation
downward
bend
their
sight
and
to
their
earthly
mother
tend
man
looks
aloft
and
with
erected
eyes
beholds
his
own
hereditary
only
let
it
be
decided
that
the
image
of
god
which
appears
or
sparkles
in
these
external
characters
is
spiritual
for
osiander
whose
perverse
ingenuity
in
futile
notions
is
proved
by
his
writings
extending
the
image
of
god
promiscuously
to
the
body
as
well
as
to
the
soul
confounds
heaven
and
earth
together
he
says
that
the
father
and
son
and
holy
spirit
fixed
their
image
in
man
because
even
if
adam
had
remained
in
his
integrity
christ
would
nevertheless
have
become
man
thus
according
to
him
the
body
which
had
been
destined
for
christ
was
the
exemplar
and
type
of
that
corporeal
figure
which
was
then
formed
but
where
will
he
find
that
christ
is
the
image
of
the
spirit
i
grant
indeed
that
the
glory
of
the
whole
deity
shines
in
the
person
of
the
mediator
but
how
shall
the
eternal
word
be
called
the
image
of
the
spirit
whom
he
precedes
in
order
lastly
it
subverts
the
distinction
between
the
son
and
spirit
if
the
former
be
denominated
the
image
of
the
latter
besides
i
could
wish
to
be
informed
by
him
how
christ
in
the
body
which
he
has
assumed
resembles
the
spirit
and
by
what
characters
or
lineaments
his
similitude
is
expressed
and
since
that
speech
let
us
make
man
in
our
own
image
belongs
also
to
the
person
of
the
son
it
follows
that
he
is
the
image
of
himself
which
is
altogether
repugnant
to
reason
moreover
if
the
notion
of
osiander
be
received
man
was
formed
only
to
the
type
or
exemplar
of
the
humanity
of
christ
and
the
idea
from
which
adam
was
taken
was
christ
as
about
to
be
clothed
in
flesh
whereas
the
scripture
teaches
in
a
very
different
sense
that
man
was
created
in
the
image
of
there
is
more
plausibility
in
the
subtlety
of
those
who
maintain
that
adam
was
created
in
the
image
of
god
because
he
was
conformed
to
christ
who
is
the
only
image
of
god
but
this
also
is
destitute
of
solidity
there
is
no
small
controversy
concerning
image
and
likeness
among
expositors
who
seek
for
a
difference
whereas
in
reality
there
is
none
between
the
two
words
likeness
being
only
added
by
way
of
explanation
in
the
first
place
we
know
that
it
is
the
custom
of
the
hebrews
to
use
repetitions
in
which
they
express
one
thing
twice
in
the
next
place
as
to
the
thing
itself
there
is
no
doubt
but
man
is
called
the
image
of
god
on
account
of
his
likeness
to
god
hence
it
appears
that
those
persons
make
themselves
ridiculous
who
display
more
subtlety
in
criticising
on
these
terms
whether
they
confine
that
is
image
to
the
substance
of
the
soul
and
that
is
likeness
to
its
qualities
or
whether
they
bring
forward
any
different
interpretation
because
when
god
determined
to
create
man
in
his
own
image
that
expression
being
rather
obscure
he
repeats
the
same
idea
in
this
explanatory
phrase
after
our
likeness
as
though
he
had
said
that
he
was
about
to
make
man
in
whom
as
in
an
image
he
would
give
a
representation
of
himself
by
the
characters
of
resemblance
which
he
would
impress
upon
him
therefore
moses
a
little
after
reciting
the
same
thing
introduces
the
image
of
god
but
makes
no
mention
of
his
likeness
the
objection
of
osiander
is
quite
frivolous
that
it
is
not
a
part
of
man
or
the
soul
with
its
faculties
that
is
called
the
image
of
god
but
the
whole
adam
who
received
his
name
from
the
earth
whence
he
was
taken
it
will
be
deemed
frivolous
i
say
by
every
rational
reader
for
when
the
whole
man
is
called
mortal
the
soul
is
not
therefore
made
subject
to
death
nor
on
the
other
hand
when
man
is
called
a
rational
animal
does
reason
or
intelligence
therefore
belong
to
the
body
though
the
soul
therefore
is
not
the
whole
man
yet
there
is
no
absurdity
in
calling
him
the
image
of
god
with
relation
to
the
soul
although
i
retain
the
principle
which
i
have
just
laid
down
that
the
image
of
god
includes
all
the
excellence
in
which
the
nature
of
man
surpasses
all
the
other
species
of
animals
this
term
therefore
denotes
the
integrity
which
adam
possessed
when
he
was
endued
with
a
right
understanding
when
he
had
affections
regulated
by
reason
and
all
his
senses
governed
in
proper
order
and
when
in
the
excellency
of
his
nature
he
truly
resembled
the
excellence
of
his
creator
and
though
the
principal
seat
of
the
divine
image
was
in
the
mind
and
heart
or
in
the
soul
and
its
faculties
yet
there
was
no
part
of
man
not
even
the
body
which
was
not
adorned
with
some
rays
of
its
glory
it
is
certain
that
the
lineaments
of
the
divine
glory
are
conspicuous
in
every
part
of
the
world
whence
it
may
be
concluded
that
where
the
image
of
god
is
said
to
be
in
man
there
is
implied
a
tacit
antithesis
which
exalts
man
above
all
the
other
creatures
and
as
it
were
separates
him
from
the
vulgar
herd
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
angels
were
created
in
the
similitude
of
god
since
our
highest
perfection
will
consist
according
to
the
declaration
of
christ
in
being
like
them
but
it
is
not
in
vain
that
moses
celebrates
the
favour
of
god
towards
us
by
this
peculiar
title
especially
as
he
compares
man
only
to
visible
creatures
iv
no
complete
definition
of
this
image
however
appears
yet
to
be
given
unless
it
be
more
clearly
specified
in
what
faculties
man
excels
and
in
what
respects
he
ought
to
be
accounted
a
mirror
of
the
divine
glory
but
that
can
not
be
better
known
from
any
thing
than
from
the
reparation
of
his
corrupted
nature
there
is
no
doubt
that
adam
when
he
fell
from
his
dignity
was
by
this
defection
alienated
from
god
wherefore
although
we
allow
that
the
divine
image
was
not
utterly
annihilated
and
effaced
in
him
yet
it
was
so
corrupted
that
whatever
remains
is
but
horrible
deformity
and
therefore
the
beginning
of
our
recovery
and
salvation
is
the
restoration
which
we
obtain
through
christ
who
on
this
account
is
called
the
second
adam
because
he
restores
us
to
true
and
perfect
integrity
for
although
paul
opposing
the
quickening
spirit
received
by
the
faithful
from
christ
to
the
living
soul
in
which
adam
was
created
celebrates
the
degree
of
grace
displayed
in
regeneration
as
superior
to
that
manifested
in
creation
yet
he
contradicts
not
that
other
capital
point
that
this
is
the
end
of
regeneration
that
christ
may
form
us
anew
in
the
image
of
god
therefore
he
elsewhere
informs
us
that
the
new
man
is
renewed
in
knowledge
after
the
image
of
him
that
created
with
which
corresponds
the
following
put
on
the
new
man
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
now
we
may
see
what
paul
comprehends
in
this
renovation
in
the
first
place
he
mentions
knowledge
and
in
the
next
place
sincere
righteousness
and
holiness
whence
we
infer
that
in
the
beginning
the
image
of
god
was
conspicuous
in
the
light
of
the
mind
in
the
rectitude
of
the
heart
and
in
the
soundness
of
all
the
parts
of
our
nature
for
though
i
grant
that
the
forms
of
expression
are
synecdochical
signifying
the
whole
by
a
part
yet
this
is
an
axiom
which
can
not
be
overturned
that
what
holds
the
principal
place
in
the
renovation
of
the
divine
image
must
also
have
held
the
same
place
in
the
creation
of
it
at
first
to
the
same
purpose
is
another
passage
of
the
apostle
that
we
with
open
face
beholding
the
glory
of
christ
are
changed
into
the
same
we
see
now
how
christ
is
the
most
perfect
image
of
god
to
which
being
conformed
we
are
so
restored
that
we
bear
the
divine
image
in
true
piety
righteousness
purity
and
understanding
this
position
being
established
the
imagination
of
osiander
about
the
figure
of
the
body
immediately
vanishes
of
itself
the
passage
where
paul
calls
the
man
the
image
and
glory
of
god
to
the
exclusion
of
the
woman
from
that
degree
of
honour
appears
from
the
context
to
be
confined
to
political
subordination
but
that
the
image
which
has
been
mentioned
comprehended
whatever
relates
to
spiritual
and
eternal
life
has
now
i
think
been
sufficiently
proved
john
confirms
the
same
in
other
words
by
asserting
that
the
life
which
was
from
the
beginning
in
the
eternal
word
of
god
was
the
light
of
for
as
he
intended
to
praise
the
singular
favour
of
god
which
exalts
man
above
all
the
other
animals
to
separate
him
from
the
common
number
because
he
has
attained
no
vulgar
life
but
a
life
connected
with
the
light
of
intelligence
and
reason
at
the
same
time
shows
how
he
was
made
after
the
image
of
god
therefore
since
the
image
of
god
is
the
uncorrupted
excellence
of
human
nature
which
shone
in
adam
before
his
defection
but
was
afterwards
so
corrupted
and
almost
obliterated
that
nothing
remains
from
the
ruin
but
what
is
confused
mutilated
and
defiled
is
now
partly
visible
in
the
elect
inasmuch
as
they
are
regenerated
by
the
spirit
but
it
will
obtain
its
full
glory
in
heaven
but
that
we
may
know
the
parts
of
which
it
consists
it
is
necessary
to
treat
of
the
faculties
of
the
soul
for
that
speculation
of
augustine
is
far
from
being
solid
that
the
soul
is
a
mirror
of
the
trinity
because
it
contains
understanding
will
and
memory
nor
is
there
any
probability
in
the
opinion
which
places
the
similitude
of
god
in
the
dominion
committed
to
man
as
though
he
resembled
god
only
in
this
character
that
he
was
constituted
heir
and
possessor
of
all
things
whereas
it
must
properly
be
sought
him
not
him
it
is
an
internal
excellence
of
the
soul
but
before
i
proceed
any
further
it
is
necessary
to
combat
the
manichæan
error
which
servetus
has
attempted
to
revive
and
propagate
in
the
present
age
because
god
is
said
to
have
breathed
into
man
the
breath
of
life
they
supposed
that
the
soul
was
an
emanation
from
the
substance
of
god
as
though
some
portion
of
the
infinite
deity
had
been
conveyed
into
man
but
it
may
be
easily
and
briefly
shown
how
many
shameful
and
gross
absurdities
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
this
diabolical
error
for
if
the
soul
of
man
be
an
emanation
from
the
essence
of
god
it
will
follow
that
the
divine
nature
is
not
only
mutable
and
subject
to
passions
but
also
to
ignorance
desires
and
vices
of
every
kind
nothing
is
more
inconstant
than
man
because
his
soul
is
agitated
and
variously
distracted
by
contrary
motions
he
frequently
mistakes
through
ignorance
he
is
vanquished
by
some
of
the
smallest
temptations
we
know
that
the
soul
is
the
receptacle
of
every
kind
of
impurity
which
we
must
ascribe
to
the
divine
nature
if
we
believe
the
soul
to
be
part
of
the
essence
of
god
or
a
secret
influx
of
the
deity
who
would
not
dread
such
a
monstrous
tenet
it
is
a
certain
truth
quoted
by
paul
from
aratus
that
we
are
the
offspring
of
god
but
in
quality
not
in
substance
forasmuch
as
he
has
adorned
us
with
divine
endowments
but
to
divide
the
essence
of
the
creator
that
every
creature
may
possess
a
part
of
it
indicates
extreme
madness
it
must
therefore
be
concluded
beyond
all
doubt
notwithstanding
the
divine
image
is
impressed
on
the
souls
of
men
that
they
were
no
less
created
than
the
angels
and
creation
is
not
a
transfusion
but
an
origination
of
existence
from
nothing
nor
because
the
spirit
is
given
by
god
and
returns
to
him
on
its
departure
from
the
body
is
it
immediately
to
be
asserted
that
it
was
plucked
off
like
a
branch
from
his
essence
and
on
this
point
also
osiander
while
he
is
elated
with
his
own
illusions
has
involved
himself
in
an
impious
error
not
acknowledging
the
image
of
god
in
man
without
his
essential
righteousness
as
though
god
could
not
by
the
inconceivable
power
of
his
spirit
render
us
conformable
to
himself
unless
christ
were
to
transfuse
himself
substantially
into
us
however
some
persons
may
attempt
to
gloss
over
these
delusions
they
will
never
so
far
blind
the
eyes
of
sensible
readers
as
to
prevent
their
perceiving
that
they
savour
of
the
error
of
the
manichæans
and
where
paul
treats
of
the
restoration
of
this
image
we
may
readily
conclude
from
his
words
that
man
was
conformed
to
god
not
by
an
influx
of
his
substance
but
by
the
grace
and
power
of
his
spirit
for
he
says
that
by
beholding
the
glory
of
christ
we
are
transformed
into
the
same
image
as
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
who
certainly
operates
in
us
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
us
consubstantial
with
god
vi
it
would
be
folly
to
seek
for
a
definition
of
the
soul
from
the
heathen
philosophers
of
whom
plato
is
almost
the
only
one
who
has
plainly
asserted
it
to
be
an
immortal
substance
others
indeed
the
disciples
of
socrates
hint
at
it
but
with
great
doubts
no
one
clearly
teaches
that
of
which
he
was
not
persuaded
himself
the
sentiment
of
plato
therefore
is
more
correct
because
he
considers
the
image
of
god
as
being
in
the
soul
the
other
sects
so
confine
its
powers
and
faculties
to
the
present
life
that
they
leave
it
nothing
beyond
the
body
but
we
have
before
stated
from
the
scripture
that
it
is
an
incorporeal
substance
now
we
shall
add
that
although
it
is
not
properly
contained
in
any
place
yet
being
put
into
the
body
it
inhabits
it
as
its
dwelling
not
only
to
animate
all
its
parts
and
render
the
organs
fit
and
useful
for
their
respective
operations
but
also
to
hold
the
supremacy
in
the
government
of
human
life
and
that
not
only
in
the
concerns
of
the
terrestrial
life
but
likewise
to
excite
to
the
worship
of
god
though
this
last
point
is
not
so
evident
in
the
state
of
corruption
yet
there
remain
some
relics
of
it
impressed
even
on
our
very
vices
for
whence
proceeds
the
great
concern
of
men
about
their
reputation
but
from
shame
but
whence
proceeds
shame
unless
from
a
respect
for
virtue
the
principle
and
cause
of
which
is
that
they
understand
themselves
to
have
been
born
for
the
cultivation
of
righteousness
and
in
which
are
included
the
seeds
of
religion
but
as
without
controversy
man
was
created
to
aspire
to
a
heavenly
life
so
it
is
certain
that
the
knowledge
of
it
was
impressed
on
his
soul
and
indeed
man
would
be
deprived
of
the
principal
use
of
his
understanding
if
he
were
ignorant
of
his
felicity
the
perfection
of
which
consists
in
being
united
to
god
thus
the
chief
operation
of
the
soul
is
to
aspire
after
it
and
therefore
the
more
a
man
studies
to
approach
to
god
the
more
he
proves
himself
a
rational
creature
some
maintain
that
in
man
there
are
more
souls
than
one
a
sensitive
and
a
rational
one
but
notwithstanding
some
appearance
of
probability
in
what
they
adduce
yet
as
there
is
nothing
solid
in
their
arguments
we
must
reject
them
unless
we
are
fond
of
tormenting
ourselves
with
frivolous
and
useless
things
they
say
that
there
is
a
great
repugnancy
between
the
organic
motions
and
the
rational
part
of
the
soul
as
though
reason
were
not
also
at
variance
with
itself
and
some
of
its
counsels
were
not
in
opposition
to
others
like
hostile
armies
but
as
this
confusion
proceeds
from
the
depravity
of
nature
it
affords
no
ground
for
concluding
that
there
are
two
souls
because
the
faculties
are
not
sufficiently
harmonious
with
each
other
but
all
curious
discussion
respecting
the
faculties
themselves
i
leave
to
the
philosophers
a
simple
definition
will
suffice
us
for
the
edification
of
piety
i
confess
indeed
that
the
things
which
they
teach
are
true
and
not
only
entertaining
to
be
known
but
useful
and
well
digested
by
them
nor
do
i
prohibit
those
who
are
desirous
of
learning
from
the
study
of
them
i
admit
then
in
the
first
place
that
there
are
five
senses
which
plato
would
rather
call
organs
by
which
all
objects
are
conveyed
into
a
common
sensory
as
into
a
general
repository
that
next
follows
the
fancy
or
imagination
which
discerns
the
objects
apprehended
by
the
common
sensory
next
reason
to
which
belongs
universal
judgment
lastly
the
understanding
which
steadily
and
quietly
contemplates
the
objects
revolved
and
considered
by
reason
and
thus
to
the
understanding
reason
and
imagination
the
three
intellectual
faculties
of
the
soul
correspond
also
the
three
appetitive
will
whose
place
it
is
to
choose
those
things
which
the
understanding
and
reason
propose
to
it
the
irascible
faculty
which
embraces
the
things
offered
to
it
by
reason
and
imagination
and
the
concupiscible
faculty
which
apprehends
the
objects
presented
by
the
imagination
and
sensation
though
these
things
are
true
or
at
least
probable
yet
since
i
fear
that
they
will
involve
us
in
their
obscurity
rather
than
assist
us
i
think
they
ought
to
be
omitted
if
any
one
chooses
to
make
a
different
distribution
of
the
powers
of
the
soul
so
as
to
call
one
appetitive
which
though
void
of
reason
in
itself
obeys
reason
if
it
be
under
the
guidance
of
any
other
faculty
and
to
call
another
intellective
which
is
itself
a
partaker
of
reason
i
shall
not
much
oppose
it
nor
have
i
any
wish
to
combat
the
sentiment
of
aristotle
that
there
are
three
principles
of
intellect
and
appetite
but
let
us
rather
choose
a
division
placed
within
the
comprehension
of
all
and
which
certainly
can
not
be
sought
in
the
philosophers
for
when
they
wish
to
speak
with
the
greatest
simplicity
they
divide
the
soul
into
appetite
and
intellect
and
make
both
these
twofold
the
latter
they
say
is
sometimes
contemplative
being
content
merely
with
knowledge
and
having
no
tendency
to
action
cicero
thinks
is
designated
by
the
word
sometimes
practical
variously
influencing
the
will
with
the
apprehension
of
good
or
evil
this
division
comprehends
the
science
of
living
in
a
just
and
virtuous
manner
the
latter
that
is
appetite
they
divide
into
will
and
concupiscence
they
call
it
will
whenever
appetite
obeys
reason
but
when
shaking
off
the
yoke
of
reason
it
runs
into
intemperance
they
give
it
the
name
of
thus
they
imagine
that
man
is
always
possessed
of
reason
sufficient
for
the
proper
government
of
himself
vii
we
are
constrained
to
depart
a
little
from
this
mode
of
instruction
because
the
philosophers
being
ignorant
of
the
corruption
of
nature
proceeding
from
the
punishment
of
the
fall
improperly
confound
two
very
different
states
of
mankind
let
us
therefore
submit
the
following
the
human
soul
has
two
faculties
which
relate
to
our
present
design
the
understanding
and
the
will
now
let
it
be
the
office
of
the
understanding
to
discriminate
between
objects
as
they
shall
respectively
appear
deserving
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
but
of
the
will
to
choose
and
follow
what
the
understanding
shall
have
pronounced
to
be
good
to
abhor
and
avoid
what
it
shall
have
condemned
here
let
us
not
stay
to
discuss
those
subtleties
of
aristotle
that
the
mind
has
no
motion
of
itself
but
that
it
is
moved
by
the
choice
which
he
also
calls
the
appetitive
intellect
without
perplexing
ourselves
with
unnecessary
questions
it
should
be
sufficient
for
us
to
know
that
the
understanding
is
as
it
were
the
guide
and
governor
of
the
soul
that
the
will
always
respects
its
authority
and
waits
for
its
judgment
in
its
desires
for
which
reason
aristotle
himself
truly
observed
that
avoidance
and
pursuit
in
the
appetite
bear
a
resemblance
to
affirmation
and
negation
in
the
mind
how
certain
the
government
of
the
understanding
is
in
the
direction
of
the
will
we
shall
see
in
another
part
of
this
work
here
we
only
intend
to
show
that
no
power
can
be
found
in
the
soul
which
may
not
properly
be
referred
to
one
or
the
other
of
those
two
members
but
in
this
manner
we
comprehend
the
sense
in
the
understanding
which
some
distinguish
thus
sense
they
say
inclines
to
pleasure
whereas
the
understanding
follows
what
is
good
that
thence
it
happens
that
the
appetite
of
sense
becomes
concupiscence
and
lust
and
the
affection
of
the
understanding
becomes
will
but
instead
of
the
word
appetite
which
they
prefer
i
use
the
word
will
which
is
more
common
viii
god
has
furnished
the
soul
of
man
therefore
with
a
mind
capable
of
discerning
good
from
evil
and
just
from
unjust
and
of
discovering
by
the
light
of
reason
what
ought
to
be
pursued
or
avoided
whence
the
philosophers
called
this
directing
faculty
το
ἠγεμονικον
the
principal
or
governing
part
to
this
he
has
annexed
the
will
on
which
depends
the
choice
the
primitive
condition
of
man
was
ennobled
with
those
eminent
faculties
he
possessed
reason
understanding
prudence
and
judgment
not
only
for
the
government
of
his
life
on
earth
but
to
enable
him
to
ascend
even
to
god
and
eternal
felicity
to
these
was
added
choice
to
direct
the
appetites
and
regulate
all
the
organic
motions
so
that
the
will
should
be
entirely
conformed
to
the
government
of
reason
in
this
integrity
man
was
endued
with
free
will
by
which
if
he
had
chosen
he
might
have
obtained
eternal
life
for
here
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
introduce
the
question
respecting
the
secret
predestination
of
god
because
we
are
not
discussing
what
might
possibly
have
happened
or
not
but
what
was
the
real
nature
of
man
adam
therefore
could
have
stood
if
he
would
since
he
fell
merely
by
his
own
will
but
because
his
will
was
flexible
to
either
side
and
he
was
not
endued
with
constancy
to
persevere
therefore
he
so
easily
fell
yet
his
choice
of
good
and
evil
was
free
and
not
only
so
but
his
mind
and
will
were
possessed
of
consummate
rectitude
and
all
his
organic
parts
were
rightly
disposed
to
obedience
till
destroying
himself
he
corrupted
all
his
excellencies
hence
proceeded
the
darkness
which
overspread
the
minds
of
the
philosophers
because
they
sought
for
a
complete
edifice
among
ruins
and
for
beautiful
order
in
the
midst
of
confusion
they
held
this
principle
that
man
would
not
be
a
rational
animal
unless
he
were
endued
with
a
free
choice
of
good
or
evil
they
conceived
also
that
otherwise
all
difference
between
virtue
and
vice
would
be
destroyed
unless
man
regulated
his
life
according
to
his
own
inclination
thus
far
it
had
been
well
if
there
had
been
no
change
in
man
of
which
as
they
were
ignorant
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
they
confound
heaven
and
earth
together
but
those
who
profess
themselves
to
be
disciples
of
christ
and
yet
seek
for
free
will
in
man
now
lost
and
overwhelmed
in
spiritual
ruin
in
striking
out
a
middle
path
between
the
opinions
of
the
philosophers
and
the
doctrine
of
heaven
are
evidently
deceived
so
that
they
touch
neither
heaven
nor
earth
but
these
things
will
be
better
introduced
in
the
proper
place
at
present
be
it
only
remembered
that
man
at
his
first
creation
was
very
different
from
all
his
posterity
who
deriving
their
original
from
him
in
his
corrupted
state
have
contracted
an
hereditary
defilement
for
all
the
parts
of
his
soul
were
formed
with
the
utmost
rectitude
he
enjoyed
soundness
of
mind
and
a
will
free
to
the
choice
of
good
if
any
object
that
he
was
placed
in
a
dangerous
situation
on
account
of
the
imbecility
of
this
faculty
i
reply
that
the
station
in
which
he
was
placed
was
sufficient
to
deprive
him
of
all
excuse
for
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
that
god
should
be
confined
to
this
condition
to
make
man
so
as
to
be
altogether
incapable
either
of
choosing
or
of
committing
any
sin
it
is
true
that
such
a
nature
would
have
been
more
excellent
but
to
expostulate
with
god
as
though
he
had
been
under
any
obligation
to
bestow
this
upon
man
were
unreasonable
and
unjust
in
the
extreme
since
it
was
at
his
choice
to
bestow
as
little
as
he
pleased
but
why
he
did
not
sustain
him
with
the
power
of
perseverance
remains
concealed
in
his
mind
but
it
is
our
duty
to
restrain
our
investigations
within
the
limits
of
sobriety
he
had
received
the
power
indeed
if
he
chose
to
exert
it
but
he
had
not
the
will
to
use
that
power
for
the
consequence
of
this
will
would
have
been
perseverance
yet
there
is
no
excuse
for
him
he
received
so
much
that
he
was
the
voluntary
procurer
of
his
own
destruction
but
god
was
under
no
necessity
to
give
him
any
other
than
an
indifferent
and
mutable
will
that
from
his
fall
he
might
educe
matter
for
his
own
glory

s
preservation
and
support
of
the
world
by
his
power
and
his
government
of
every
part
of
it
by
his
providence
to
represent
god
as
a
creator
only
for
a
moment
who
entirely
finished
all
his
work
at
once
were
frigid
and
jejune
and
in
this
it
behoves
us
especially
to
differ
from
the
heathen
that
the
presence
of
the
divine
power
may
appear
to
us
no
less
in
the
perpetual
state
of
the
world
than
in
its
first
origin
for
although
the
minds
even
of
impious
men
by
the
mere
contemplation
of
earth
and
heaven
are
constrained
to
rise
to
the
creator
yet
faith
has
a
way
peculiar
to
itself
to
assign
to
god
the
whole
praise
of
creation
to
which
purpose
is
that
assertion
of
an
apostle
before
cited
that
it
is
only
through
faith
that
we
understand
the
worlds
were
framed
by
the
word
of
god
because
unless
we
proceed
to
his
providence
we
have
no
correct
conception
of
the
meaning
of
this
article
that
god
is
the
creator
however
we
may
appear
to
comprehend
it
in
our
minds
and
to
confess
it
with
our
tongues
the
carnal
sense
when
it
has
once
viewed
the
power
of
god
in
the
creation
stops
there
and
when
it
proceeds
the
furthest
it
only
examines
and
considers
the
wisdom
and
power
and
goodness
of
the
author
in
producing
such
a
work
which
spontaneously
present
themselves
to
the
view
even
of
those
who
are
unwilling
to
observe
them
in
the
next
place
it
conceives
of
some
general
operation
of
god
in
preserving
and
governing
it
on
which
the
power
of
motion
depends
lastly
it
supposes
that
the
vigour
originally
infused
by
god
into
all
things
is
sufficient
for
their
sustentation
but
faith
ought
to
penetrate
further
when
it
has
learned
that
he
is
the
creator
of
all
things
it
should
immediately
conclude
that
he
is
also
their
perpetual
governor
and
preserver
and
that
not
by
a
certain
universal
motion
actuating
the
whole
machine
of
the
world
and
all
its
respective
parts
but
by
a
particular
providence
sustaining
nourishing
and
providing
for
every
thing
which
he
has
made
thus
david
having
briefly
premised
that
the
world
was
made
by
god
immediately
descends
to
the
continual
course
of
his
providence
by
the
word
of
the
lord
were
the
heavens
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
he
afterwards
adds
the
lord
beholdeth
all
the
sons
of
men
and
subjoins
more
to
the
same
purpose
for
though
all
men
argue
not
so
skilfully
yet
since
it
would
not
be
credible
that
god
was
concerned
about
human
affairs
if
he
were
not
the
maker
of
the
world
and
no
one
seriously
believes
that
the
world
was
made
by
god
who
is
not
persuaded
that
he
takes
care
of
his
own
works
it
is
not
without
reason
that
david
conducts
us
by
a
most
excellent
series
from
one
to
the
other
in
general
indeed
both
philosophers
teach
and
the
minds
of
men
conceive
that
all
the
parts
of
the
world
are
quickened
by
the
secret
inspiration
of
god
but
they
go
not
so
far
as
david
who
is
followed
by
all
the
pious
when
he
says
these
all
wait
upon
thee
that
thou
mayest
give
them
their
meat
in
due
season
that
thou
givest
them
they
gather
thou
openest
thine
hand
they
are
filled
with
good
thou
hidest
thy
face
they
are
troubled
thou
takest
away
their
breath
they
die
and
return
to
their
dust
thou
sendest
forth
thy
spirit
they
are
created
and
thou
renewest
the
face
of
the
though
they
subscribe
to
the
assertion
of
paul
that
in
god
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
yet
they
are
very
far
from
a
serious
sense
of
his
favour
celebrated
by
the
apostle
because
they
have
no
apprehension
of
the
special
care
of
god
from
which
alone
his
paternal
favour
is
known
ii
for
the
clearer
manifestation
of
this
difference
it
must
be
observed
that
the
providence
of
god
as
it
is
taught
in
scripture
is
opposed
to
fortune
and
fortuitous
accidents
now
since
it
has
been
the
common
persuasion
in
all
ages
and
is
also
in
the
present
day
almost
the
universal
opinion
that
all
things
happen
fortuitously
it
is
certain
that
every
correct
sentiment
concerning
providence
is
not
only
obscured
but
almost
buried
in
oblivion
by
this
erroneous
notion
if
any
one
falls
into
the
hands
of
robbers
or
meets
with
wild
beasts
if
by
a
sudden
storm
he
is
shipwrecked
on
the
ocean
if
he
is
killed
by
the
fall
of
a
house
or
a
tree
if
another
wandering
through
deserts
finds
relief
for
his
penury
or
after
having
been
tossed
about
by
the
waves
reaches
the
port
and
escapes
as
it
were
but
a
hair
from
death
reason
will
ascribe
all
these
occurrences
both
prosperous
and
adverse
to
fortune
but
whoever
has
been
taught
from
the
mouth
of
christ
that
the
hairs
of
his
head
are
all
numbered
will
seek
further
for
a
cause
and
conclude
that
all
events
are
governed
by
the
secret
counsel
of
god
and
respecting
things
inanimate
it
must
be
admitted
that
though
they
are
all
naturally
endued
with
their
peculiar
properties
yet
they
exert
not
their
power
any
further
than
as
they
are
directed
by
the
present
hand
of
god
they
are
therefore
no
other
than
instruments
into
which
god
infuses
as
much
efficacy
as
he
pleases
bending
and
turning
them
to
any
actions
according
to
his
will
there
is
no
power
among
all
the
creatures
more
wonderful
or
illustrious
than
that
of
the
sun
for
besides
his
illumination
of
the
whole
world
by
his
splendour
how
astonishing
it
is
that
he
cherishes
and
enlivens
all
animals
with
his
heat
with
his
rays
inspires
fecundity
into
the
earth
from
the
seeds
genially
warmed
in
her
bosom
produces
a
green
herbage
which
being
supported
by
fresh
nourishment
he
increases
and
strengthens
till
it
rises
into
stalks
feeds
them
with
perpetual
exhalations
till
they
grow
into
blossoms
and
from
blossoms
to
fruit
which
he
then
by
his
influences
brings
to
maturity
that
trees
likewise
and
vines
by
his
genial
warmth
first
put
forth
leaves
then
blossoms
and
from
the
blossoms
produce
their
fruit
but
the
lord
to
reserve
the
praise
of
all
these
things
entirely
to
himself
was
pleased
that
the
light
should
exist
and
the
earth
abound
in
every
kind
of
herbs
and
fruits
before
he
created
the
sun
a
pious
man
therefore
will
not
make
the
sun
either
a
principal
or
necessary
cause
of
those
things
which
existed
before
the
creation
of
the
sun
but
only
an
instrument
which
god
uses
because
it
is
his
pleasure
so
to
do
whereas
he
would
find
no
more
difficulty
in
acting
by
himself
without
that
luminary
lastly
as
we
read
that
the
sun
remained
in
one
situation
for
two
days
at
the
prayer
of
joshua
and
that
his
shadow
made
a
retrograde
motion
of
ten
degrees
for
the
sake
of
king
hezekiah
god
has
declared
by
these
few
miracles
that
the
daily
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
is
not
from
a
blind
instinct
of
nature
but
that
he
himself
governs
his
course
to
renew
the
memory
of
his
paternal
favour
towards
us
nothing
is
more
natural
than
the
succession
of
spring
to
winter
of
summer
to
spring
and
of
autumn
to
summer
but
there
is
so
great
a
diversity
and
inequality
discovered
in
this
series
that
it
is
obvious
that
every
year
month
and
day
is
governed
by
a
new
and
particular
providence
of
god
iii
and
indeed
god
asserts
his
possession
of
omnipotence
and
claims
our
acknowledgment
of
this
attribute
not
such
as
is
imagined
by
sophists
vain
idle
and
almost
asleep
but
vigilant
efficacious
operative
and
engaged
in
continual
action
not
a
mere
general
principle
of
confused
motion
as
if
he
should
command
a
river
to
flow
through
the
channels
once
made
for
it
but
a
power
constantly
exerted
on
every
distinct
and
particular
movement
for
he
is
accounted
omnipotent
not
because
he
is
able
to
act
yet
sits
down
in
idleness
or
continues
by
a
general
instinct
the
order
of
nature
originally
appointed
by
him
but
because
he
governs
heaven
and
earth
by
his
providence
and
regulates
all
things
in
such
a
manner
that
nothing
happens
but
according
to
his
counsel
for
when
it
is
said
in
the
psalms
that
he
does
whatsoever
he
pleases
it
denotes
his
certain
and
deliberate
will
for
it
would
be
quite
insipid
to
expound
the
words
of
the
prophet
in
the
philosophical
manner
that
god
is
the
prime
agent
because
he
is
the
principle
and
cause
of
all
motion
whereas
the
faithful
should
rather
encourage
themselves
in
adversity
with
this
consolation
that
they
suffer
no
affliction
but
by
the
ordination
and
command
of
god
because
they
are
under
his
hand
but
if
the
government
of
god
be
thus
extended
to
all
his
works
it
is
a
puerile
cavil
to
limit
it
to
the
influence
and
course
of
nature
and
they
not
only
defraud
god
of
his
glory
but
themselves
of
a
very
useful
doctrine
who
confine
the
divine
providence
within
such
narrow
bounds
as
though
he
permitted
all
things
to
proceed
in
an
uncontrolled
course
according
to
a
perpetual
law
of
nature
for
nothing
would
exceed
the
misery
of
man
if
he
were
exposed
to
all
the
motions
of
the
heaven
air
earth
and
waters
besides
this
notion
would
shamefully
diminish
the
singular
goodness
of
god
towards
every
individual
david
exclaims
that
infants
yet
hanging
on
the
breasts
of
their
mothers
are
sufficiently
eloquent
to
celebrate
the
glory
of
god
because
as
soon
as
they
are
born
they
find
aliment
prepared
for
them
by
his
heavenly
care
this
indeed
is
generally
true
yet
it
can
not
escape
the
observation
of
our
eyes
and
senses
being
evidently
proved
by
experience
that
some
mothers
have
breasts
full
and
copious
but
others
almost
dry
as
it
pleases
god
to
provide
more
liberally
for
one
but
more
sparingly
for
another
but
they
who
ascribe
just
praise
to
the
divine
omnipotence
receive
from
this
a
double
advantage
in
the
first
place
he
must
have
ample
ability
to
bless
them
who
possesses
heaven
and
earth
and
whose
will
all
the
creatures
regard
so
as
to
devote
themselves
to
his
service
and
secondly
they
may
securely
repose
in
his
protection
to
whose
will
are
subject
all
those
evils
which
can
be
feared
from
any
quarter
by
whose
power
satan
is
restrained
with
all
his
furies
and
all
his
machinations
on
whose
will
depends
all
that
is
inimical
to
our
safety
nor
is
there
any
thing
else
by
which
those
immoderate
and
superstitious
fears
which
we
frequently
feel
on
the
sight
of
dangers
can
be
corrected
or
appeased
we
are
superstitiously
timid
i
say
if
whenever
creatures
menace
or
terrify
us
we
are
frightened
as
though
they
had
of
themselves
the
power
to
hurt
us
or
could
fortuitously
injure
us
or
as
if
against
their
injuries
god
were
unable
to
afford
us
sufficient
aid
for
example
the
prophet
forbids
the
children
of
god
to
fear
the
stars
and
signs
of
heaven
as
is
the
custom
of
unbelievers
he
certainly
condemns
not
every
kind
of
fear
but
when
infidels
transfer
the
government
of
the
world
from
god
to
the
stars
pretending
that
their
happiness
or
misery
depends
on
the
decrees
and
presages
of
the
stars
and
not
on
the
will
of
god
the
consequence
is
that
their
fear
is
withdrawn
from
him
whom
alone
they
ought
to
regard
and
is
placed
on
stars
and
comets
whoever
then
desires
to
avoid
this
infidelity
let
him
constantly
remember
that
in
the
creatures
there
is
no
erratic
power
or
action
or
motion
but
that
they
are
so
governed
by
the
secret
counsel
of
god
that
nothing
can
happen
but
what
is
subject
to
his
knowledge
and
decreed
by
his
will
iv
first
then
let
the
readers
know
that
what
is
called
providence
describes
god
not
as
idly
beholding
from
heaven
the
transactions
which
happen
in
the
world
but
as
holding
the
helm
of
the
universe
and
regulating
all
events
thus
it
belongs
no
less
to
his
hands
than
to
his
eyes
when
abraham
said
to
his
son
god
will
provide
he
intended
not
only
to
assert
his
prescience
of
a
future
event
but
to
leave
the
care
of
a
thing
unknown
to
the
will
of
him
who
frequently
puts
an
end
to
circumstances
of
perplexity
and
confusion
whence
it
follows
that
providence
consists
in
action
for
it
is
ignorant
trifling
to
talk
of
mere
prescience
not
quite
so
gross
is
the
error
of
those
who
attribute
to
god
a
government
as
i
have
observed
of
a
confused
and
promiscuous
kind
acknowledging
that
god
revolves
and
impels
the
machine
of
the
world
with
all
its
parts
by
a
general
motion
without
peculiarly
directing
the
action
of
each
individual
creature
yet
even
this
error
is
not
to
be
tolerated
for
they
maintain
that
this
providence
which
they
call
universal
is
no
impediment
either
to
all
the
creatures
being
actuated
contingently
or
to
man
turning
himself
hither
or
thither
at
the
free
choice
of
his
own
will
and
they
make
the
following
partition
between
god
and
man
that
god
by
his
power
inspires
him
with
motions
enabling
him
to
act
according
to
the
tendency
of
the
nature
with
which
he
is
endued
but
that
man
governs
his
actions
by
his
own
voluntary
choice
in
short
they
conceive
that
the
world
human
affairs
and
men
themselves
are
governed
by
the
power
of
god
but
not
by
his
appointment
i
speak
not
of
the
epicureans
who
have
always
infested
the
world
who
dream
of
a
god
absorbed
in
sloth
and
inactivity
and
of
others
no
less
erroneous
who
formerly
pretended
that
the
dominion
of
god
extended
over
the
middle
region
of
the
air
but
that
he
left
inferior
things
to
fortune
since
the
mute
creatures
themselves
sufficiently
exclaim
against
such
evident
stupidity
my
present
design
is
to
refute
that
opinion
which
has
almost
generally
prevailed
which
conceding
to
god
a
sort
of
blind
and
uncertain
motion
deprives
him
of
the
principal
thing
which
is
his
directing
and
disposing
by
his
incomprehensible
wisdom
all
things
to
their
proper
end
and
thus
robbing
god
of
the
government
of
the
world
it
makes
him
the
ruler
of
it
in
name
only
and
not
in
reality
for
pray
what
is
governing
but
presiding
in
such
a
manner
as
to
rule
by
fixed
decrees
those
over
whom
you
preside
yet
i
reject
not
altogether
what
they
assert
concerning
universal
providence
provided
they
on
their
part
admit
that
god
governs
the
world
not
merely
because
he
preserves
the
order
of
nature
fixed
by
himself
but
because
he
exercises
a
peculiar
care
over
every
one
of
his
works
it
is
true
that
all
things
are
actuated
by
a
secret
instinct
of
nature
as
though
they
obeyed
the
eternal
command
of
god
and
that
what
god
has
once
appointed
appears
to
proceed
from
voluntary
inclination
in
the
creatures
and
to
this
may
be
referred
the
declaration
of
christ
that
his
father
and
himself
had
always
been
working
even
from
the
beginning
and
the
assertion
of
paul
that
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
also
what
is
observed
by
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
with
a
design
to
prove
the
divinity
of
christ
that
all
things
are
sustained
by
the
word
of
his
power
but
they
act
very
improperly
in
concealing
and
obscuring
by
this
pretext
the
doctrine
of
a
particular
providence
which
is
asserted
in
such
plain
and
clear
testimonies
of
scripture
that
it
is
surprising
how
any
one
could
entertain
a
doubt
concerning
it
and
certainly
they
who
conceal
it
with
this
veil
which
i
have
mentioned
are
obliged
to
correct
themselves
by
adding
that
many
things
happen
through
the
peculiar
care
of
god
but
this
they
erroneously
restrict
to
some
particular
acts
wherefore
we
have
to
prove
that
god
attends
to
the
government
of
particular
events
and
that
they
all
proceed
from
his
determinate
counsel
in
such
a
manner
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
fortuitous
contingence
if
we
grant
that
the
principle
of
motion
originates
from
god
but
that
all
things
are
spontaneously
or
accidentally
carried
whither
the
bias
of
nature
impels
them
the
mutual
vicissitudes
of
day
and
night
of
winter
and
summer
will
be
the
work
of
god
inasmuch
as
he
has
distributed
to
each
its
respective
parts
and
prescribed
to
them
a
certain
law
that
is
this
would
be
the
case
if
with
even
tenor
they
always
observed
the
same
measure
days
succeeding
to
nights
months
to
months
and
years
to
years
but
sometimes
excessive
heats
and
drought
parch
and
burn
the
fruits
of
the
earth
sometimes
unseasonable
rains
injure
the
crops
of
corn
and
sudden
calamities
are
occasioned
by
showers
of
hail
and
storms
this
will
not
be
the
work
of
god
unless
perhaps
as
either
clouds
or
serene
weather
or
cold
or
heat
derive
their
origin
from
the
opposition
of
the
stars
and
other
natural
causes
but
this
representation
leaves
no
room
for
god
to
display
or
exercise
his
paternal
favour
or
his
judgments
if
they
say
that
god
is
sufficiently
beneficent
to
man
because
he
infuses
into
heaven
and
earth
an
ordinary
power
by
which
they
supply
him
with
food
it
is
a
very
flimsy
and
profane
notion
as
though
the
fecundity
of
one
year
were
not
the
singular
benediction
of
god
and
as
though
penury
and
famine
were
not
his
malediction
and
vengeance
but
as
it
would
be
tedious
to
collect
all
the
reasons
for
rejecting
this
error
let
us
be
content
with
the
authority
of
god
himself
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets
he
frequently
declares
that
whenever
he
moistens
the
earth
with
dew
or
with
rain
he
affords
a
testimony
of
his
favour
and
that
on
the
contrary
when
at
his
command
heaven
becomes
hard
as
iron
when
the
crops
of
corn
are
blasted
and
otherwise
destroyed
and
when
showers
of
hail
and
storms
molest
the
fields
he
gives
a
proof
of
his
certain
and
special
vengeance
if
we
believe
these
things
it
is
certain
that
not
a
drop
of
rain
falls
but
at
the
express
command
of
god
david
indeed
praises
the
general
providence
of
god
because
he
giveth
food
to
the
young
ravens
which
cry
but
when
god
himself
threatens
animals
with
famine
does
he
not
plainly
declare
that
he
feeds
all
living
creatures
sometimes
with
a
smaller
allowance
sometimes
with
a
larger
as
he
pleases
it
is
puerile
as
i
have
already
observed
to
restrain
this
to
particular
acts
whereas
christ
says
without
any
exception
that
not
a
sparrow
of
the
least
value
falls
to
the
ground
without
the
will
of
the
father
certainly
if
the
flight
of
birds
be
directed
by
the
unerring
counsel
of
god
we
must
be
constrained
to
confess
with
the
prophet
that
though
he
dwelleth
on
high
yet
he
humbleth
himself
to
behold
the
things
which
are
in
heaven
and
in
the
vi
but
as
we
know
that
the
world
was
made
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
mankind
we
must
also
observe
this
end
in
the
government
of
it
the
prophet
jeremiah
exclaims
i
know
that
the
way
of
man
is
not
in
himself
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
and
solomon
man
s
goings
are
of
the
lord
how
can
a
man
then
understand
his
own
way
now
let
them
say
that
man
is
actuated
by
god
according
to
the
bias
of
his
nature
but
that
he
directs
that
influence
according
to
his
own
pleasure
if
this
could
be
asserted
with
truth
man
would
have
the
free
choice
of
his
own
ways
that
perhaps
they
will
deny
because
he
can
do
nothing
independently
of
the
power
of
god
but
since
it
is
evident
that
both
the
prophet
and
solomon
ascribe
to
god
choice
and
appointment
as
well
as
power
this
by
no
means
extricates
them
from
the
difficulty
but
solomon
in
another
place
beautifully
reproves
this
temerity
of
men
who
predetermine
on
an
end
for
themselves
without
regard
to
god
as
though
they
were
not
led
by
his
hand
the
preparation
of
the
heart
in
man
says
he
and
the
answer
of
the
tongue
is
from
the
it
is
indeed
a
ridiculous
madness
for
miserable
men
to
resolve
on
undertaking
any
work
independently
of
god
whilst
they
can
not
even
speak
a
word
but
what
he
chooses
moreover
the
scripture
more
fully
to
express
that
nothing
is
transacted
in
the
world
but
according
to
his
destination
shows
that
those
things
are
subject
to
him
which
appear
most
fortuitous
for
what
would
you
be
more
ready
to
attribute
to
chance
than
when
a
limb
broken
off
from
a
tree
kills
a
passing
traveller
but
very
different
is
the
decision
of
the
lord
who
acknowledges
that
he
has
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
the
slayer
who
likewise
does
not
leave
lots
to
the
blindness
of
fortune
yet
the
lord
leaves
them
not
but
claims
the
disposal
of
them
himself
he
teaches
us
that
it
is
not
by
any
power
of
their
own
that
lots
are
cast
into
the
lap
and
drawn
out
but
the
only
thing
which
could
be
ascribed
to
chance
he
declares
to
belong
to
himself
to
the
same
purpose
is
another
passage
from
solomon
the
poor
and
the
deceitful
man
meet
together
the
lord
enlighteneth
the
eyes
of
them
for
although
the
poor
and
the
rich
are
blended
together
in
the
world
yet
as
their
respective
conditions
are
assigned
to
them
by
divine
appointment
he
suggests
that
god
who
enlightens
all
is
not
blind
and
thus
exhorts
the
poor
to
patience
because
those
who
are
discontented
with
their
lot
are
endeavouring
to
shake
off
the
burden
imposed
on
them
by
god
thus
also
another
prophet
rebukes
profane
persons
who
attribute
it
to
human
industry
or
to
fortune
that
some
men
remain
in
obscurity
and
others
rise
to
honours
promotion
cometh
neither
from
the
east
nor
from
the
west
nor
from
the
south
but
god
is
the
judge
he
putteth
down
one
and
setteth
up
since
god
can
not
divest
himself
of
the
office
of
a
judge
hence
he
reasons
that
it
is
from
the
secret
counsel
of
god
that
some
rise
to
promotion
and
others
remain
in
contempt
vii
moreover
particular
events
are
in
general
proofs
of
the
special
providence
of
god
god
raised
in
the
desert
a
south
wind
to
convey
to
the
people
a
large
flock
of
birds
when
he
would
have
jonah
thrown
into
the
sea
he
sent
forth
a
wind
to
raise
a
tempest
it
will
be
said
by
them
who
suppose
god
not
to
hold
the
helm
of
the
world
that
this
was
a
deviation
from
the
common
course
of
things
but
the
conclusion
which
i
deduce
from
it
is
that
no
wind
ever
rises
or
blows
but
by
the
special
command
of
god
for
otherwise
it
would
not
be
true
that
he
makes
the
winds
his
messengers
and
a
flame
of
fire
his
ministers
that
he
makes
the
clouds
his
chariot
and
rides
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
unless
he
directed
at
his
pleasure
the
course
both
of
the
clouds
and
of
the
winds
and
displayed
in
them
the
singular
presence
of
his
power
thus
also
we
are
elsewhere
taught
that
whenever
the
sea
is
blown
into
a
tempest
by
the
winds
those
commotions
prove
the
special
presence
of
god
he
commandeth
and
raiseth
the
stormy
wind
which
lifteth
up
the
waves
of
the
sea
then
he
maketh
the
storm
a
calm
so
that
the
waves
thereof
are
still
as
in
another
place
he
proclaims
that
he
scourged
the
people
with
parching
winds
thus
whilst
men
are
naturally
endued
with
a
power
of
generation
yet
god
will
have
it
acknowledged
as
the
effect
of
his
special
favour
that
he
leaves
some
without
any
posterity
and
bestows
children
on
others
for
the
fruit
of
the
womb
is
his
therefore
jacob
said
to
his
wife
am
i
in
god
s
stead
who
hath
withheld
from
thee
the
fruit
of
the
womb
but
to
conclude
there
is
nothing
more
common
in
nature
than
for
us
to
be
nourished
with
bread
but
the
spirit
declares
not
only
that
the
produce
of
the
earth
is
the
special
gift
of
god
but
that
men
do
not
live
by
bread
alone
because
they
are
supported
not
by
the
abundance
of
their
food
but
by
the
secret
benediction
of
god
as
on
the
contrary
he
threatens
that
he
will
break
the
stay
of
nor
indeed
could
we
otherwise
seriously
offer
a
prayer
for
daily
bread
if
god
did
not
supply
us
with
food
from
his
fatherly
hand
the
prophet
therefore
to
convince
the
faithful
that
in
feeding
them
god
acts
the
part
of
an
excellent
father
of
a
family
informs
us
that
he
giveth
food
to
all
lastly
when
we
hear
on
the
one
hand
that
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
upon
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
cry
and
on
the
other
that
the
face
of
the
lord
is
against
them
that
do
evil
to
cut
off
the
remembrance
of
them
from
the
earth
we
may
be
assured
that
all
creatures
above
and
below
are
ready
for
his
service
that
he
may
apply
them
to
any
use
that
he
pleases
hence
we
conclude
not
only
that
there
is
a
general
providence
of
god
over
the
creatures
to
continue
the
order
of
nature
but
that
by
his
wonderful
counsel
they
are
all
directed
to
some
specific
and
proper
end
viii
those
who
wish
to
bring
an
odium
on
this
doctrine
calumniate
it
as
the
same
with
the
opinion
of
the
stoics
concerning
fate
with
which
augustine
also
was
formerly
reproached
though
we
are
averse
to
all
contentions
about
words
yet
we
admit
not
the
term
both
because
it
is
of
that
novel
and
profane
kind
which
paul
teaches
us
to
avoid
and
because
they
endeavour
to
load
the
truth
of
god
with
the
odium
attached
to
it
but
that
dogma
is
falsely
and
maliciously
charged
upon
us
for
we
do
not
with
the
stoics
imagine
a
necessity
arising
from
a
perpetual
concatenation
and
intricate
series
of
causes
contained
in
nature
but
we
make
god
the
arbiter
and
governor
of
all
things
who
in
his
own
wisdom
has
from
the
remotest
eternity
decreed
what
he
would
do
and
now
by
his
own
power
executes
what
he
has
decreed
whence
we
assert
that
not
only
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
inanimate
creatures
but
also
the
deliberations
and
volitions
of
men
are
so
governed
by
his
providence
as
to
be
directed
to
the
end
appointed
by
it
what
then
you
will
say
does
nothing
happen
fortuitously
or
contingently
i
answer
that
it
was
truly
observed
by
basil
the
great
that
and
are
words
of
the
heathen
with
the
signification
of
which
the
minds
of
the
pious
ought
not
to
be
occupied
for
if
all
success
be
the
benediction
of
god
and
calamity
and
adversity
his
malediction
there
is
no
room
left
in
human
affairs
for
fortune
or
chance
and
we
should
attend
to
this
declaration
of
augustine
i
am
not
pleased
with
myself
says
he
for
having
in
my
treatises
against
the
academics
so
frequently
mentioned
although
i
have
not
intended
by
that
word
any
goddess
but
a
fortuitous
occurrence
of
external
things
either
good
or
evil
hence
also
such
words
the
use
of
which
no
religion
prohibits
as
which
nevertheless
must
be
entirely
referred
to
the
divine
providence
and
on
this
i
have
not
been
silent
remarking
that
perhaps
what
is
commonly
termed
is
regulated
by
a
secret
order
and
that
what
we
call
is
only
that
with
the
reason
and
cause
of
which
we
are
not
acquainted
thus
indeed
i
have
expressed
myself
but
i
repent
of
having
mentioned
in
this
manner
since
i
see
that
men
are
habituated
to
a
very
sinful
custom
when
they
ought
to
say
this
was
the
will
of
god
they
say
this
was
the
will
of
finally
he
every
where
maintains
that
if
any
thing
be
left
to
fortune
the
world
revolves
at
random
and
though
he
elsewhere
decides
that
all
things
are
conducted
partly
by
the
free
will
of
man
partly
by
the
providence
of
god
yet
he
just
after
shows
that
men
are
subject
to
it
and
governed
by
it
assuming
as
a
principle
that
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
than
for
any
thing
to
happen
independently
of
the
ordination
of
god
because
it
would
happen
at
random
by
this
reasoning
he
excludes
also
any
contingence
dependent
on
the
human
will
and
immediately
after
more
expressly
asserts
that
we
ought
not
to
inquire
for
any
cause
of
the
will
of
god
but
in
what
sense
ought
to
be
understood
whenever
it
is
mentioned
by
him
will
appear
from
one
passage
where
he
proves
that
the
will
of
god
is
the
supreme
and
first
cause
of
all
things
because
nothing
happens
but
by
his
command
or
permission
he
certainly
does
not
suppose
god
to
remain
an
idle
spectator
determining
to
permit
any
thing
there
is
an
intervention
of
actual
volition
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
which
otherwise
could
never
be
considered
as
a
cause
ix
yet
since
the
dulness
of
our
minds
is
very
much
below
the
sublimity
of
the
divine
providence
let
us
endeavour
to
assist
them
by
a
distinction
i
say
then
that
notwithstanding
the
ordination
of
all
things
by
the
certain
purpose
and
direction
of
god
yet
to
us
they
are
fortuitous
not
that
we
suppose
fortune
holds
any
dominion
over
the
world
and
mankind
and
whirls
about
all
things
at
random
for
such
folly
ought
to
be
far
from
the
breast
of
a
christian
but
because
the
order
reason
end
and
necessity
of
events
are
chiefly
concealed
in
the
purpose
of
god
and
not
comprehended
by
the
mind
of
man
those
things
are
in
some
measure
fortuitous
which
must
certainly
happen
according
to
the
divine
will
for
they
present
no
other
appearance
whether
they
are
considered
in
their
own
nature
or
are
estimated
according
to
our
knowledge
and
judgment
let
us
suppose
for
example
that
a
merchant
having
entered
a
wood
in
the
company
of
honest
men
imprudently
wanders
from
his
companions
and
pursuing
a
wrong
course
falls
into
the
hands
of
robbers
and
is
murdered
his
death
was
not
only
foreseen
by
god
but
also
decreed
by
him
for
it
is
said
not
that
he
has
foreseen
to
what
limits
the
life
of
every
man
would
extend
but
that
he
hath
appointed
bounds
which
he
can
not
yet
as
far
as
our
minds
are
capable
of
comprehending
all
these
circumstances
appear
fortuitous
what
opinion
shall
a
christian
form
on
this
case
he
will
consider
all
the
circumstances
of
such
a
death
as
in
their
nature
fortuitous
yet
he
will
not
doubt
that
the
providence
of
god
presided
and
directed
fortune
to
that
end
the
same
reasoning
will
apply
to
future
contingencies
all
future
things
being
uncertain
to
us
we
hold
them
in
suspense
as
though
they
might
happen
either
one
way
or
another
yet
this
remains
a
fixed
principle
in
our
hearts
that
there
will
be
no
event
which
god
has
not
ordained
in
this
sense
the
word
is
frequently
repeated
in
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
because
on
the
first
view
men
penetrate
not
to
the
first
cause
which
lies
deeply
concealed
and
yet
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
respecting
the
secret
providence
of
god
has
never
been
so
far
obliterated
from
the
hearts
of
men
but
that
some
sparks
of
it
always
shone
in
the
darkness
thus
the
philistine
sorcerers
though
they
fluctuated
in
uncertainty
ascribed
adverse
accidents
partly
to
god
partly
to
fortune
if
the
ark
say
they
goeth
up
by
that
way
we
shall
know
that
god
hath
done
us
this
great
evil
but
if
not
it
was
a
chance
that
happened
to
they
betrayed
great
folly
indeed
after
having
been
deceived
by
divination
to
have
recourse
to
fortune
yet
at
the
same
time
we
see
them
restrained
so
that
they
can
not
dare
to
suppose
the
affliction
which
had
befallen
them
was
fortuitous
but
how
god
by
the
reins
of
his
providence
directs
all
events
according
to
his
own
pleasure
will
appear
by
an
eminent
example
at
the
very
same
instant
of
time
when
david
had
been
overtaken
in
the
wilderness
of
maon
behold
the
philistines
made
an
irruption
into
the
land
and
saul
was
compelled
to
depart
if
god
consulting
the
safety
of
his
servant
laid
this
impediment
in
the
way
of
saul
then
surely
though
the
philistines
might
have
taken
up
arms
suddenly
and
contrary
to
human
expectation
yet
we
will
not
say
that
this
happened
by
chance
but
what
to
us
seems
a
contingency
faith
will
acknowledge
to
have
been
a
secret
impulse
of
god
it
is
not
always
indeed
that
there
appears
a
similar
reason
but
it
should
be
considered
as
indubitably
certain
that
all
the
revolutions
visible
in
the
world
proceed
from
the
secret
exertion
of
the
divine
power
what
god
decrees
must
necessarily
come
to
pass
yet
it
is
not
by
absolute
or
natural
necessity
we
find
a
familiar
example
in
respect
to
the
bones
of
christ
since
he
possessed
a
body
like
ours
no
reasonable
man
will
deny
that
his
bones
were
capable
of
being
broken
yet
that
they
should
be
broken
was
impossible
hence
again
we
perceive
that
the
distinctions
of
relative
and
absolute
necessity
as
well
as
necessity
of
consequent
and
of
consequence
were
not
without
reason
invented
in
the
schools
since
god
made
the
bones
of
his
son
capable
of
being
broken
which
however
he
had
exempted
from
being
actually
broken
and
thus
prevented
by
the
necessity
of
his
purpose
what
might
naturally
have
come
to
pass
chapter
xvii
the
proper
application
of
this
doctrine
to
render
it
useful
to
us
as
the
minds
of
men
are
prone
to
vain
subtleties
there
is
the
greatest
danger
that
those
who
know
not
the
right
use
of
this
doctrine
will
embarrass
themselves
with
intricate
perplexities
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
to
touch
in
a
brief
manner
on
the
end
and
design
of
the
scripture
doctrine
of
the
divine
ordination
of
all
things
and
here
let
it
be
remarked
in
the
first
place
that
the
providence
of
god
is
to
be
considered
as
well
in
regard
to
futurity
as
in
reference
to
that
which
is
past
secondly
that
it
governs
all
things
in
such
a
manner
as
to
operate
sometimes
by
the
intervention
of
means
sometimes
without
means
and
sometimes
in
opposition
to
all
means
lastly
that
it
tends
to
show
the
care
of
god
for
the
whole
human
race
and
especially
his
vigilance
in
the
government
of
the
church
which
he
favours
with
more
particular
attention
it
must
also
be
observed
that
although
the
paternal
favour
and
beneficence
of
god
or
the
severity
of
his
justice
is
frequently
conspicuous
in
the
whole
course
of
his
providence
yet
sometimes
the
causes
of
events
are
concealed
so
that
a
suspicion
intrudes
itself
that
the
revolutions
of
human
affairs
are
conducted
by
the
blind
impetuosity
of
fortune
or
the
flesh
solicits
us
to
murmur
as
though
god
amused
himself
with
tossing
men
about
like
it
is
true
indeed
if
we
were
ready
to
learn
with
quiet
and
sober
minds
that
the
final
issue
sufficiently
proves
the
counsels
of
god
to
be
directed
by
the
best
of
reasons
that
he
designs
either
to
teach
his
people
the
exercise
of
patience
or
to
correct
their
corrupt
affections
and
subdue
the
licentiousness
of
their
appetites
or
to
constrain
them
to
the
practice
of
or
to
arouse
them
from
their
indolence
and
on
the
other
hand
to
abase
the
proud
to
disappoint
the
cunning
of
the
wicked
and
to
confound
their
machinations
yet
however
the
causes
may
be
concealed
from
us
or
escape
our
observation
we
must
admit
it
as
a
certain
truth
that
they
are
hidden
with
him
and
must
therefore
exclaim
with
david
many
o
lord
my
god
are
thy
wonderful
works
which
thou
hast
done
and
thy
thoughts
which
are
to
they
can
not
be
reckoned
up
in
order
unto
thee
if
i
would
declare
and
speak
of
them
they
are
more
than
can
be
for
though
our
miseries
ought
always
to
remind
us
of
our
sins
that
the
punishment
itself
may
urge
us
to
repentance
yet
we
see
that
christ
ascribes
more
sovereignty
to
the
secret
purpose
of
the
father
in
afflicting
men
than
to
require
him
to
punish
every
individual
according
to
his
demerits
for
concerning
him
who
was
born
blind
he
says
neither
hath
this
man
sinned
nor
his
parents
but
that
the
works
of
god
should
be
made
manifest
in
for
here
sense
murmurs
when
calamity
precedes
the
very
birth
as
though
it
were
a
detraction
from
the
divine
clemency
thus
to
afflict
the
innocent
but
christ
declares
that
the
glory
of
his
father
is
manifested
in
this
instance
provided
our
eyes
are
clear
to
behold
it
but
we
must
proceed
with
modesty
cautious
that
we
call
not
god
to
an
account
at
our
tribunal
but
that
we
entertain
such
reverence
for
his
secret
judgments
as
to
esteem
his
will
the
most
righteous
cause
of
every
thing
that
he
does
when
thick
clouds
obscure
the
heavens
and
a
violent
tempest
arises
because
a
gloomy
mist
is
before
our
eyes
and
thunder
strikes
our
ears
and
terror
stupefies
all
our
faculties
all
things
seem
to
us
to
be
blended
in
confusion
yet
during
the
whole
time
the
heavens
remain
in
the
same
quiet
serenity
so
it
must
be
concluded
that
while
the
turbulent
state
of
the
world
deprives
us
of
our
judgment
god
by
the
pure
light
of
his
own
righteousness
and
wisdom
regulates
all
those
commotions
in
the
most
exact
order
and
directs
them
to
their
proper
end
and
certainly
the
madness
of
many
in
this
respect
is
monstrous
who
dare
to
arraign
the
works
of
god
to
scrutinize
his
secret
counsels
and
even
to
pass
a
precipitate
sentence
on
things
unknown
with
greater
freedom
than
on
the
actions
of
mortal
men
for
what
is
more
preposterous
than
towards
our
equals
to
observe
such
modesty
as
rather
to
suspend
our
judgment
than
to
incur
the
imputation
of
temerity
but
impudently
to
insult
the
mysterious
judgments
of
god
which
we
ought
to
hold
in
admiration
and
reverence
ii
none
therefore
will
attain
just
and
profitable
views
of
the
providence
of
god
but
he
who
considers
that
he
has
to
do
with
his
maker
and
the
creator
of
the
world
and
submits
himself
to
fear
and
reverence
with
all
becoming
humility
hence
it
happens
that
so
many
worthless
characters
in
the
present
day
virulently
oppose
this
doctrine
because
they
will
admit
nothing
to
be
lawful
for
god
but
what
agrees
with
the
dictates
of
their
own
reason
they
revile
us
with
the
utmost
possible
impudence
because
not
content
with
the
precepts
of
the
law
which
comprehend
the
will
of
god
we
say
that
the
world
is
governed
also
by
his
secret
counsels
as
though
indeed
what
we
assert
were
only
an
invention
of
our
own
brain
and
the
holy
spirit
did
not
every
where
plainly
announce
the
same
and
repeat
it
in
innumerable
forms
of
expression
but
as
they
are
restrained
by
some
degree
of
shame
from
daring
to
discharge
their
blasphemies
against
heaven
in
order
to
indulge
their
extravagance
with
greater
freedom
they
pretend
that
they
are
contending
with
us
but
unless
they
admit
that
whatever
comes
to
pass
in
the
world
is
governed
by
the
incomprehensible
counsel
of
god
let
them
answer
to
what
purpose
is
it
said
in
the
scripture
that
his
judgments
are
a
great
deep
for
since
moses
proclaims
that
the
will
of
god
is
not
to
be
sought
far
off
in
the
clouds
or
in
the
deep
because
it
is
familiarly
explained
in
the
law
it
follows
that
there
is
another
secret
will
which
is
compared
to
a
profound
abyss
concerning
which
paul
also
says
o
the
depth
of
the
riches
both
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgments
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor
it
is
true
that
the
law
and
the
gospel
contain
mysteries
which
far
transcend
our
capacities
but
since
god
illuminates
the
minds
of
his
people
with
the
spirit
of
understanding
to
apprehend
these
mysteries
which
he
has
condescended
to
reveal
in
his
word
there
we
have
now
no
abyss
but
a
way
in
which
we
may
safely
walk
and
a
lamp
for
the
direction
of
our
feet
the
light
of
life
and
the
school
of
certain
and
evident
truth
but
his
admirable
method
of
governing
the
world
is
justly
called
a
great
deep
because
while
it
is
concealed
from
our
view
it
ought
to
be
the
object
of
our
profound
adoration
moses
has
beautifully
expressed
both
in
a
few
words
the
secret
things
says
he
belong
unto
the
lord
our
god
but
those
things
which
are
revealed
belong
unto
us
and
to
our
we
see
how
he
enjoins
us
not
only
to
devote
our
attention
to
meditations
on
the
law
of
god
but
to
look
up
with
reverence
to
his
mysterious
providence
this
sublime
doctrine
is
declared
in
the
book
of
job
for
the
purpose
of
humbling
our
minds
for
the
author
concludes
a
general
view
of
the
machine
of
the
world
and
a
magnificent
dissertation
on
the
works
of
god
in
these
words
lo
these
are
parts
of
his
ways
but
how
little
a
portion
is
heard
of
him
for
which
reason
in
another
place
he
distinguishes
between
the
wisdom
which
resides
in
god
and
the
method
of
attaining
wisdom
which
he
has
prescribed
to
men
for
after
discoursing
concerning
the
secrets
of
nature
he
says
that
wisdom
is
known
only
to
god
and
is
hid
from
the
eyes
of
all
but
a
little
after
he
subjoins
that
it
is
published
in
order
to
be
investigated
because
it
is
said
to
men
behold
the
fear
of
the
lord
that
is
to
the
same
purpose
is
this
observation
of
augustine
because
we
know
not
all
that
god
does
concerning
us
by
an
excellent
order
we
act
according
to
the
law
in
a
good
will
only
but
in
other
respects
are
actuated
according
to
it
because
his
providence
is
an
immutable
therefore
since
god
claims
a
power
unknown
to
us
of
governing
the
world
let
this
be
to
us
the
law
of
sobriety
and
modesty
to
acquiesce
in
his
supreme
dominion
to
account
his
will
the
only
rule
of
righteousness
and
most
righteous
cause
of
all
things
not
indeed
that
absolute
will
which
is
the
subject
of
the
declamation
of
sophists
impiously
and
profanely
separating
his
justice
from
his
power
but
that
providence
which
governs
all
things
from
which
originates
nothing
but
what
is
right
although
the
reasons
of
it
may
be
concealed
from
us
iii
those
who
have
learned
this
modesty
will
neither
murmur
against
god
on
account
of
past
adversities
nor
charge
him
with
the
guilt
of
their
crimes
like
agamemnon
in
homer
who
says
the
blame
belongs
not
to
me
but
to
jupiter
and
nor
will
they
as
if
hurried
away
by
the
fates
under
the
influence
of
despair
put
an
end
to
their
own
lives
like
the
young
man
whom
plautus
introduces
as
saying
the
condition
of
our
affairs
is
inconstant
men
are
governed
by
the
caprice
of
the
fates
i
will
betake
myself
to
a
precipice
and
there
destroy
my
life
and
every
thing
at
nor
will
they
excuse
their
flagitious
actions
by
ascribing
them
to
god
after
the
example
of
another
young
man
introduced
by
the
same
poet
who
says
god
was
the
cause
i
believe
it
was
the
divine
will
for
had
it
not
been
so
i
know
it
would
not
have
but
they
will
rather
search
the
scripture
to
learn
what
is
pleasing
to
god
that
by
the
guidance
of
the
spirit
they
may
strive
to
attain
it
and
at
the
same
time
being
prepared
to
follow
god
whithersoever
he
calls
them
they
will
exhibit
proofs
in
their
conduct
that
nothing
is
more
useful
than
a
knowledge
of
this
doctrine
some
profane
men
foolishly
raise
such
a
tumult
with
their
absurdities
as
almost
according
to
a
common
expression
to
confound
heaven
and
earth
together
they
argue
in
this
manner
if
god
has
fixed
the
moment
of
our
death
we
can
not
avoid
it
therefore
all
caution
against
it
will
be
but
lost
labour
one
man
dares
not
venture
himself
in
a
way
which
he
hears
is
dangerous
lest
he
should
be
assassinated
by
robbers
another
sends
for
physicians
and
wearies
himself
with
medicines
to
preserve
his
life
another
abstains
from
the
grosser
kinds
of
food
lest
he
should
injure
his
valetudinary
constitution
another
dreads
to
inhabit
a
ruinous
house
and
men
in
general
exert
all
their
faculties
in
devising
and
executing
methods
by
which
they
may
attain
the
object
of
their
desires
now
either
all
these
things
are
vain
remedies
employed
to
correct
the
will
of
god
or
life
and
death
health
and
disease
peace
and
war
and
other
things
which
according
to
their
desires
or
aversions
men
industriously
study
to
obtain
or
to
avoid
are
not
determined
by
his
certain
decree
moreover
they
conclude
that
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
are
not
only
superfluous
but
perverse
which
contain
petitions
that
the
lord
will
provide
for
those
things
which
he
has
already
decreed
from
eternity
in
short
they
supersede
all
deliberations
respecting
futurity
as
opposed
to
the
providence
of
god
who
without
consulting
men
has
decreed
whatever
he
pleased
and
what
has
already
happened
they
impute
to
the
divine
providence
in
such
a
manner
as
to
overlook
the
person
who
is
known
to
have
committed
any
particular
act
has
an
assassin
murdered
a
worthy
citizen
they
say
he
has
executed
the
counsel
of
god
has
any
one
been
guilty
of
theft
or
fornication
because
he
has
done
what
was
foreseen
and
ordained
by
the
lord
he
is
the
minister
of
his
providence
has
a
son
neglecting
all
remedies
carelessly
waited
the
death
of
his
father
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
resist
god
who
had
decreed
this
event
from
eternity
thus
by
these
persons
all
crimes
are
denominated
virtues
because
they
are
subservient
to
the
ordination
of
god
iv
but
in
reference
to
future
things
solomon
easily
reconciles
the
deliberations
of
men
with
the
providence
of
god
for
as
he
ridicules
the
folly
of
those
who
presumptuously
undertake
any
thing
without
the
lord
as
though
they
were
not
subject
to
his
government
so
in
another
place
he
says
a
man
s
heart
deviseth
his
way
but
the
lord
directeth
his
steps
signifying
that
the
eternal
decrees
of
god
form
no
impediment
to
our
providing
for
ourselves
and
disposing
all
our
concerns
in
subservience
to
his
will
the
reason
of
this
is
manifest
for
he
who
has
fixed
the
limits
of
our
life
has
also
intrusted
us
with
the
care
of
it
has
furnished
us
with
means
and
supplies
for
its
preservation
has
also
made
us
provident
of
dangers
and
that
they
may
not
oppress
us
unawares
has
furnished
us
with
cautions
and
remedies
now
it
is
evident
what
is
our
duty
if
god
has
committed
to
us
the
preservation
of
our
life
we
should
preserve
it
if
he
offers
supplies
we
should
use
them
if
he
forewarns
us
of
dangers
we
should
not
rashly
run
into
them
if
he
furnishes
remedies
we
ought
not
to
neglect
them
but
it
will
be
objected
no
danger
can
hurt
unless
it
has
been
ordained
that
it
shall
hurt
us
and
then
no
remedies
can
avert
it
but
what
if
dangers
are
therefore
not
fatal
because
god
has
assigned
you
remedies
to
repulse
and
overcome
them
examine
whether
your
reasoning
agrees
with
the
order
of
the
divine
providence
you
conclude
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
guard
against
danger
because
if
it
be
not
fatal
we
shall
escape
it
without
caution
but
on
the
contrary
the
lord
enjoins
you
to
use
caution
because
he
intends
it
not
to
be
fatal
to
you
these
madmen
overlook
what
is
obvious
to
every
the
arts
of
deliberation
and
caution
in
men
proceed
from
the
inspiration
of
god
and
that
they
subserve
the
designs
of
his
providence
in
the
preservation
of
their
own
lives
as
on
the
contrary
by
neglect
and
slothfulness
they
procure
to
themselves
the
evils
which
he
has
appointed
for
them
for
how
does
it
happen
that
a
prudent
man
consulting
his
own
welfare
averts
from
himself
impending
evils
and
a
fool
is
ruined
by
his
inconsiderate
temerity
unless
folly
and
prudence
are
in
both
cases
instruments
of
the
divine
dispensation
therefore
it
has
pleased
god
to
conceal
from
us
all
future
events
that
we
may
meet
them
as
doubtful
contingencies
and
not
cease
to
oppose
to
them
the
remedies
with
which
we
are
provided
till
they
shall
have
been
surmounted
or
shall
have
overcome
all
our
diligence
therefore
i
have
before
suggested
that
the
providence
of
god
ought
not
always
to
be
contemplated
abstractedly
by
itself
but
in
connection
with
the
means
which
he
employs
the
same
persons
inconsiderately
and
erroneously
ascribe
all
past
events
to
the
absolute
providence
of
god
for
since
all
things
which
come
to
pass
are
dependent
upon
it
therefore
say
they
neither
thefts
nor
adulteries
nor
homicides
are
perpetrated
without
the
intervention
of
the
divine
will
why
therefore
they
ask
shall
a
thief
be
punished
for
having
pillaged
him
whom
it
has
pleased
the
lord
to
chastise
with
poverty
why
shall
a
homicide
be
punished
for
having
slain
him
whose
life
the
lord
had
terminated
if
all
such
characters
are
subservient
to
the
divine
will
why
shall
they
be
punished
but
i
deny
that
they
serve
the
will
of
god
for
we
can
not
say
that
he
who
is
influenced
by
a
wicked
heart
acts
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
god
while
he
is
only
gratifying
his
own
malignant
passions
that
man
obeys
god
who
being
instructed
in
his
will
hastens
whither
god
calls
him
where
can
we
learn
his
will
but
in
his
word
therefore
in
our
actions
we
ought
to
regard
the
will
of
god
which
is
declared
in
his
word
god
only
requires
of
us
conformity
to
his
precepts
if
we
do
any
thing
contrary
to
them
it
is
not
obedience
but
contumacy
and
transgression
but
it
is
said
if
he
would
not
permit
it
we
should
not
do
it
this
i
grant
but
do
we
perform
evil
actions
with
the
design
of
pleasing
him
he
gives
us
no
such
command
we
precipitate
ourselves
into
them
not
considering
what
is
his
will
but
inflamed
with
the
violence
of
our
passions
so
that
we
deliberately
strive
to
oppose
him
in
this
manner
even
by
criminal
actions
we
subserve
his
righteous
ordination
because
in
the
infinite
greatness
of
his
wisdom
he
well
knows
how
to
use
evil
instruments
for
the
accomplishment
of
good
purposes
now
observe
the
absurdity
of
their
reasoning
they
wish
the
authors
of
crimes
to
escape
with
impunity
because
crimes
are
not
perpetrated
but
by
the
ordination
of
god
i
admit
more
than
this
even
that
thieves
and
homicides
and
other
malefactors
are
instruments
of
divine
providence
whom
the
lord
uses
for
the
execution
of
the
judgments
which
he
has
appointed
but
i
deny
that
this
ought
to
afford
any
excuse
for
their
crimes
for
will
they
either
implicate
god
in
the
same
iniquity
with
themselves
or
cover
their
depravity
with
his
righteousness
they
can
do
neither
they
are
prevented
from
exculpating
themselves
by
the
reproofs
of
their
own
consciences
and
they
can
lay
no
blame
upon
god
for
they
find
in
themselves
nothing
but
evil
and
in
him
only
a
legitimate
use
of
their
wickedness
but
it
is
alleged
that
he
operates
by
their
means
and
whence
i
ask
proceeds
the
fetid
smell
of
a
carcass
which
has
been
putrefied
and
disclosed
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
it
is
visible
to
all
that
it
is
excited
by
the
solar
rays
yet
no
person
on
this
account
attributes
to
those
rays
an
offensive
smell
so
when
the
matter
and
guilt
of
evil
resides
in
a
bad
man
why
should
god
be
supposed
to
contract
any
defilement
if
he
uses
his
service
according
to
his
own
pleasure
let
us
dismiss
this
petulance
therefore
which
may
rail
against
the
justice
of
god
from
a
distance
but
can
never
reach
that
divine
attribute
vi
but
these
cavils
or
rather
extravagancies
of
frenzy
will
easily
be
dispelled
by
the
pious
and
holy
contemplation
of
providence
which
the
rule
of
piety
dictates
to
us
so
that
we
may
derive
from
it
the
greatest
pleasure
and
advantage
the
mind
of
a
christian
therefore
when
it
is
certainly
persuaded
that
all
things
happen
by
the
ordination
of
god
and
that
there
is
nothing
fortuitously
contingent
will
always
direct
its
views
to
him
as
the
supreme
cause
of
all
things
and
will
also
consider
inferior
causes
in
their
proper
order
he
will
not
doubt
that
the
particular
providence
of
god
is
watchful
for
his
preservation
never
permitting
any
event
which
it
will
not
overrule
for
his
advantage
and
safety
but
since
he
is
concerned
in
the
first
place
with
men
and
in
the
next
place
with
the
other
creatures
he
will
assure
himself
as
to
both
that
the
providence
of
god
reigns
over
all
with
respect
to
men
whether
good
or
evil
he
will
acknowledge
that
their
deliberations
wills
endeavours
and
powers
are
under
his
control
so
that
it
is
at
his
option
to
direct
them
whithersoever
he
pleases
and
to
restrain
them
as
often
as
he
pleases
the
vigilance
of
the
particular
providence
of
god
for
the
safety
of
the
faithful
is
attested
by
numerous
and
very
remarkable
promises
cast
thy
burden
upon
the
lord
and
he
shall
sustain
thee
he
shall
never
suffer
the
righteous
to
be
moved
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
he
that
toucheth
you
toucheth
the
apple
of
his
eye
we
have
a
strong
city
salvation
will
god
appoint
for
walls
and
bulwarks
though
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
yet
will
i
not
forget
moreover
this
is
the
principal
scope
of
the
biblical
histories
to
teach
us
that
the
lord
so
sedulously
defends
the
ways
of
the
saints
that
they
may
not
even
dash
their
foot
against
a
therefore
as
we
have
a
little
before
justly
exploded
the
opinion
of
those
who
hold
a
universal
providence
of
god
which
descends
not
to
the
care
of
every
creature
in
particular
so
it
is
principally
necessary
and
useful
to
contemplate
this
special
care
towards
ourselves
for
this
reason
christ
after
having
asserted
that
not
the
meanest
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
without
the
will
of
the
father
immediately
makes
the
following
the
more
we
exceed
the
value
of
sparrows
the
greater
care
we
should
consider
god
as
exercising
over
us
and
he
carries
this
to
such
an
extent
that
we
may
be
confident
that
the
hairs
of
our
head
are
numbered
what
more
can
we
desire
for
ourselves
if
not
a
single
hair
can
fall
from
our
head
but
according
to
his
will
i
speak
not
exclusively
of
the
human
race
but
since
god
has
chosen
the
church
for
his
habitation
there
is
no
doubt
but
he
particularly
displays
his
paternal
care
in
the
government
of
it
vii
the
servant
of
god
encouraged
by
these
promises
and
examples
will
add
the
testimonies
which
inform
us
that
all
men
are
subject
to
his
power
either
to
conciliate
their
minds
in
our
favour
or
to
restrain
their
malice
from
being
injurious
for
it
is
the
lord
who
gives
us
favour
not
only
with
our
friends
but
also
in
the
eyes
of
the
egyptians
and
he
knows
how
to
subdue
by
various
methods
the
fury
of
our
enemies
sometimes
he
deprives
them
of
understanding
so
that
they
can
form
no
sober
or
prudent
plans
as
he
sent
satan
to
fill
the
mouths
of
all
the
prophets
with
falsehood
in
order
to
deceive
ahab
he
infatuated
rehoboam
by
the
counsel
of
the
young
men
that
through
his
own
folly
he
might
be
spoiled
of
his
kingdom
sometimes
when
he
grants
them
understanding
he
so
terrifies
and
dispirits
them
that
they
can
neither
determine
nor
undertake
what
they
have
conceived
sometimes
also
when
he
has
permitted
them
to
attempt
what
their
rage
and
passion
prompted
he
opportunely
breaks
their
impetuosity
not
suffering
them
to
proceed
to
the
accomplishment
of
their
designs
thus
he
prematurely
defeated
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
which
would
have
been
fatal
to
david
thus
also
he
takes
care
to
govern
all
creatures
for
the
benefit
and
safety
of
his
people
even
the
devil
himself
who
we
see
dared
not
to
attempt
any
thing
against
job
without
his
permission
and
command
the
necessary
consequences
of
this
knowledge
are
gratitude
in
prosperity
patience
in
adversity
and
a
wonderful
security
respecting
the
future
every
prosperous
and
pleasing
event
therefore
the
pious
man
will
ascribe
entirely
to
god
whether
his
beneficence
be
received
through
the
ministry
of
men
or
by
the
assistance
of
inanimate
creatures
for
this
will
be
the
reflection
of
his
mind
it
is
certainly
the
lord
that
has
inclined
their
hearts
to
favour
me
that
has
united
them
to
me
to
be
the
instruments
of
his
benignity
towards
in
an
abundance
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
he
will
consider
that
it
is
the
lord
who
regards
the
heaven
that
the
heaven
may
regard
the
earth
that
the
earth
also
may
regard
its
own
productions
in
other
things
he
will
not
doubt
that
it
is
the
divine
benediction
alone
which
is
the
cause
of
all
prosperity
nor
will
he
bear
to
be
ungrateful
after
so
many
admonitions
viii
if
any
adversity
befall
him
in
this
case
also
he
will
immediately
lift
up
his
heart
to
god
whose
hand
is
most
capable
of
impressing
us
with
patience
and
placid
moderation
of
mind
if
joseph
had
dwelt
on
a
review
of
the
perfidy
of
his
brethren
he
never
could
have
recovered
his
fraternal
affection
for
them
but
as
he
turned
his
mind
to
the
lord
he
forgot
their
injuries
and
was
so
inclined
to
mildness
and
clemency
as
even
voluntarily
to
administer
consolation
to
them
saying
it
was
not
you
that
sent
me
hither
but
god
did
send
me
before
you
to
save
your
lives
ye
thought
evil
against
me
but
god
meant
it
unto
if
job
had
regarded
the
chaldeans
by
whom
he
was
molested
he
had
been
inflamed
to
revenge
but
recognizing
the
event
at
the
same
time
as
the
work
of
the
lord
he
consoled
himself
with
this
very
beautiful
observation
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
thus
david
when
assailed
by
shimei
with
reproachful
language
and
with
stones
if
he
had
confined
his
views
to
man
would
have
animated
his
soldiers
to
retaliate
the
injury
but
understanding
that
it
was
not
done
without
the
instigation
of
the
lord
he
rather
appeases
them
let
him
curse
says
he
because
the
lord
hath
said
unto
him
curse
in
another
place
he
imposes
the
same
restraint
on
the
intemperance
of
his
grief
i
was
dumb
says
he
i
opened
not
my
mouth
because
thou
didst
if
there
be
no
more
efficacious
remedy
for
anger
and
impatience
surely
that
man
has
made
no
small
proficiency
who
has
learned
in
this
case
to
meditate
on
the
divine
providence
that
he
may
be
able
at
all
times
to
recall
his
mind
to
this
consideration
it
is
the
will
of
the
lord
therefore
it
must
be
endured
not
only
because
resistance
is
unlawful
and
vain
but
because
he
wills
nothing
but
what
is
both
just
and
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
is
when
we
suffer
injuries
from
men
forgetting
their
malice
which
would
only
exasperate
our
grief
and
instigate
our
minds
to
revenge
we
should
remember
to
ascend
to
god
and
learn
to
account
it
a
certain
truth
that
whatever
our
enemies
have
criminally
committed
against
us
has
been
permitted
and
directed
by
his
righteous
dispensation
to
restrain
us
from
retaliating
injuries
paul
prudently
admonishes
us
that
our
contention
is
not
with
flesh
and
blood
but
with
a
spiritual
enemy
the
devil
in
order
that
we
may
prepare
ourselves
for
the
contest
but
this
admonition
is
the
most
useful
in
appeasing
all
the
sallies
of
resentment
that
god
arms
for
the
conflict
both
the
devil
and
all
wicked
men
and
sits
himself
as
the
arbiter
of
the
combat
to
exercise
our
patience
but
if
the
calamities
and
miseries
which
oppress
us
happen
without
the
interposition
of
men
let
us
recollect
the
doctrine
of
the
law
that
every
prosperous
event
proceeds
from
the
benediction
of
god
but
that
all
adverse
ones
are
his
maledictions
and
let
us
tremble
at
that
awful
denunciation
if
ye
will
walk
contrary
unto
me
then
will
i
also
walk
contrary
unto
you
language
which
reproves
our
stupidity
while
according
to
the
common
apprehensions
of
the
flesh
esteeming
every
event
both
prosperous
and
adverse
to
be
fortuitous
we
are
neither
animated
to
the
worship
of
god
by
his
benefits
nor
stimulated
to
repentance
by
his
corrections
this
is
the
reason
of
the
sharp
expostulations
of
jeremiah
and
of
amos
because
the
jews
supposed
that
both
good
and
evil
events
came
to
pass
without
any
appointment
of
god
to
the
same
purpose
is
this
passage
of
isaiah
i
form
the
light
and
create
darkness
i
make
peace
and
create
evil
i
the
lord
do
all
these
ix
yet
at
the
same
time
a
pious
man
will
not
overlook
inferior
causes
nor
because
he
accounts
those
from
whom
he
has
received
any
benefit
the
ministers
of
the
divine
goodness
will
he
therefore
pass
them
by
unnoticed
as
though
they
deserved
no
thanks
for
their
kindness
but
will
feel
and
readily
acknowledge
his
obligation
to
them
and
study
to
return
it
as
ability
and
opportunity
may
permit
finally
he
will
reverence
and
praise
god
as
the
principal
author
of
benefits
received
but
will
honour
men
as
his
ministers
and
will
understand
what
indeed
is
the
fact
that
the
will
of
god
has
laid
him
under
obligations
to
those
persons
by
whose
means
the
lord
has
been
pleased
to
communicate
his
benefits
if
he
suffer
any
loss
either
through
negligence
or
through
imprudence
he
will
conclude
that
it
happened
according
to
the
divine
will
but
will
also
impute
the
blame
of
it
to
himself
if
any
one
be
removed
by
disease
whom
while
it
was
his
duty
to
take
care
of
him
he
has
treated
with
neglect
he
can
not
be
ignorant
that
that
person
had
reached
those
limits
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
pass
yet
he
will
not
make
this
a
plea
to
extenuate
his
guilt
but
because
he
has
not
faithfully
performed
his
duty
towards
him
will
consider
him
as
having
perished
through
his
criminal
negligence
much
less
when
fraud
and
preconceived
malice
appear
in
the
perpetration
either
of
murder
or
of
theft
will
he
excuse
those
enormities
under
the
pretext
of
the
divine
providence
in
the
same
crime
he
will
distinctly
contemplate
the
righteousness
of
god
and
the
iniquity
of
man
as
they
respectively
discover
themselves
but
it
is
principally
in
regard
to
things
future
that
he
will
direct
his
attention
to
inferior
causes
of
this
kind
for
he
will
rank
it
among
the
blessings
of
the
lord
not
to
be
destitute
of
human
aids
which
he
may
use
for
his
own
safety
he
will
neither
be
remiss
therefore
in
taking
the
advice
nor
negligent
in
imploring
the
help
of
those
whom
he
perceives
to
be
capable
of
affording
him
assistance
but
considering
all
the
creatures
that
can
in
any
respect
be
serviceable
to
him
as
so
many
gifts
from
the
lord
he
will
use
them
as
the
legitimate
instruments
of
the
divine
providence
and
as
he
is
uncertain
respecting
the
issue
of
his
undertakings
except
that
he
knows
that
the
lord
will
in
all
things
provide
for
his
good
he
studiously
aims
at
what
according
to
the
best
judgment
he
can
form
will
be
for
his
advantage
nor
in
conducting
his
deliberations
will
he
be
carried
away
by
his
own
opinion
but
will
recommend
and
resign
himself
to
the
wisdom
of
god
that
he
may
be
directed
by
its
guidance
to
the
right
end
but
he
will
not
place
his
confidence
in
external
helps
to
such
a
degree
as
if
possessed
of
them
securely
to
rely
on
them
or
if
destitute
of
them
to
tremble
with
despair
for
his
mind
will
always
be
fixed
solely
on
the
divine
providence
nor
will
he
suffer
himself
to
be
seduced
from
a
steady
contemplation
of
it
by
any
consideration
of
present
things
thus
joab
though
he
acknowledges
the
event
of
battle
to
depend
on
the
will
and
the
power
of
god
yet
surrenders
not
himself
to
inactivity
but
sedulously
executes
all
the
duties
of
his
office
and
leaves
the
event
to
the
divine
decision
let
us
play
the
men
says
he
for
our
people
and
for
the
cities
of
our
god
and
the
lord
do
that
which
seemeth
him
this
knowledge
will
divest
us
of
temerity
and
false
confidence
and
excite
us
to
continual
invocations
of
god
it
will
also
support
our
minds
with
a
good
hope
that
without
hesitation
we
may
securely
and
magnanimously
despise
all
the
dangers
which
surround
us
herein
is
discovered
the
inestimable
felicity
of
the
pious
mind
human
life
is
beset
by
innumerable
evils
and
threatened
with
a
thousand
deaths
not
to
go
beyond
ourselves
our
body
is
the
receptacle
of
a
thousand
diseases
and
even
contains
and
fosters
the
causes
of
diseases
a
man
must
unavoidably
carry
about
with
him
destruction
in
unnumbered
forms
and
protract
a
life
which
is
as
it
were
involved
in
death
for
what
else
can
you
say
of
it
when
neither
cold
nor
heat
in
any
considerable
degree
can
be
endured
without
danger
now
whithersoever
you
turn
all
the
objects
around
you
are
not
only
unworthy
of
your
confidence
but
almost
openly
menace
you
and
seem
to
threaten
immediate
death
embark
in
a
ship
there
is
but
a
single
step
between
you
and
death
mount
a
horse
the
slipping
of
one
foot
endangers
your
life
walk
through
the
streets
of
a
city
you
are
liable
to
as
many
dangers
as
there
are
tiles
on
the
roofs
if
there
be
a
sharp
weapon
in
your
hand
or
that
of
your
friend
the
mischief
is
manifest
all
the
ferocious
animals
you
see
are
armed
for
your
destruction
if
you
endeavour
to
shut
yourself
in
a
garden
surrounded
with
a
good
fence
and
exhibiting
nothing
but
what
is
delightful
even
there
sometimes
lurks
a
serpent
your
house
perpetually
liable
to
fire
menaces
you
by
day
with
poverty
and
by
night
with
falling
on
your
head
your
land
exposed
to
hail
frost
drought
and
various
tempests
threatens
you
with
sterility
and
with
its
attendant
famine
i
omit
poison
treachery
robbery
and
open
violence
which
partly
beset
us
at
home
and
partly
pursue
us
abroad
amidst
these
difficulties
must
not
man
be
most
miserable
who
is
half
dead
while
he
lives
and
is
dispirited
and
alarmed
as
though
he
had
a
sword
perpetually
applied
to
his
neck
you
will
say
that
these
things
happen
seldom
or
certainly
not
always
nor
to
every
man
but
never
all
at
once
i
grant
it
but
as
we
are
admonished
by
the
examples
of
others
that
it
is
possible
for
them
to
happen
also
to
us
and
that
we
have
no
more
claim
to
exemption
from
them
than
others
we
must
unavoidably
dread
them
as
events
that
we
may
expect
what
can
you
imagine
more
calamitous
than
such
a
dread
besides
it
is
an
insult
to
god
to
say
that
he
has
exposed
man
the
noblest
of
his
creatures
to
the
blindness
and
temerity
of
fortune
but
here
i
intend
to
speak
only
of
the
misery
which
man
must
feel
if
he
be
subject
to
the
dominion
of
fortune
xi
on
the
contrary
when
this
light
of
divine
providence
has
once
shined
on
a
pious
man
he
is
relieved
and
delivered
not
only
from
the
extreme
anxiety
and
dread
with
which
he
was
previously
oppressed
but
also
from
all
care
for
as
he
justly
dreads
fortune
so
he
ventures
securely
to
commit
himself
to
god
this
i
say
is
his
consolation
to
apprehend
that
his
heavenly
father
restrains
all
things
by
his
power
governs
all
things
by
his
will
and
regulates
all
things
by
his
wisdom
in
such
a
manner
that
nothing
can
happen
but
by
his
appointment
moreover
that
god
has
taken
him
under
his
protection
and
committed
him
to
the
care
of
angels
so
that
he
can
sustain
no
injury
from
water
or
fire
or
sword
any
further
than
the
divine
governor
may
be
pleased
to
permit
for
thus
sings
the
psalmist
surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
nor
for
the
pestilence
that
walketh
in
darkness
nor
for
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
hence
also
proceeds
that
confidence
of
glorying
in
the
saints
the
lord
is
on
my
side
i
will
not
fear
what
man
can
do
unto
me
the
lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
i
be
afraid
though
a
host
should
encamp
against
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
how
is
it
that
their
security
remains
unshaken
while
the
world
appears
to
be
revolving
at
random
but
because
they
know
that
the
lord
is
universally
operative
and
confide
in
his
operations
as
beneficial
to
them
now
when
their
safety
is
attacked
either
by
the
devil
or
by
wicked
men
if
they
were
not
supported
by
the
recollection
and
contemplation
of
providence
they
must
necessarily
and
immediately
faint
but
when
they
recollect
that
the
devil
and
the
whole
army
of
the
wicked
are
in
every
respect
so
restrained
by
the
divine
power
that
they
can
neither
conceive
of
any
hostility
against
us
nor
after
having
conceived
it
form
a
plan
for
its
accomplishment
nor
even
move
a
finger
towards
the
execution
of
such
plan
any
further
than
he
has
permitted
and
even
commanded
them
and
that
they
are
not
only
bound
by
his
chains
but
also
compelled
to
do
him
service
have
an
abundant
source
of
consolation
for
as
it
belongs
to
the
lord
to
arm
their
fury
and
to
direct
it
to
whatever
objects
he
pleases
so
it
also
belongs
to
him
to
fix
its
limits
that
they
may
not
enjoy
an
unbounded
triumph
according
to
their
own
wills
established
in
this
persuasion
paul
determined
his
journey
in
one
place
by
the
permission
of
god
which
in
another
he
had
declared
was
prevented
by
satan
if
he
had
only
said
that
satan
was
the
obstacle
he
would
have
appeared
to
attribute
too
much
power
to
him
as
though
he
were
able
to
subvert
the
purposes
of
god
but
when
he
states
god
to
be
the
arbiter
on
whose
permission
all
journeys
depend
he
at
the
same
time
shows
that
satan
with
all
his
machinations
can
effect
nothing
but
by
his
permission
for
the
same
reason
david
on
account
of
the
various
and
constant
vicissitudes
of
life
betakes
himself
to
this
asylum
my
times
are
in
thy
he
might
have
mentioned
either
the
course
of
life
or
in
the
singular
number
but
by
the
word
he
intended
to
express
that
however
unstable
the
condition
of
men
may
be
all
the
vicissitudes
which
take
place
are
under
the
government
of
god
for
which
reason
rezin
and
the
king
of
israel
when
after
the
junction
of
their
forces
for
the
destruction
of
judah
they
resembled
firebrands
kindled
to
consume
and
ruin
the
land
are
called
by
the
prophet
smoking
firebrands
which
can
do
nothing
but
emit
a
little
smoke
thus
pharaoh
when
his
riches
his
strength
and
the
multitude
of
his
forces
rendered
him
formidable
to
all
is
himself
compared
to
a
and
his
forces
to
fishes
therefore
god
denounces
that
he
will
take
both
the
captain
and
his
army
with
his
hook
and
draw
them
whither
he
pleases
finally
to
dwell
no
longer
on
this
part
of
the
subject
you
will
easily
perceive
on
examination
that
ignorance
of
providence
is
the
greatest
of
miseries
but
that
the
knowledge
of
it
is
attended
with
the
highest
felicity
xii
on
the
doctrine
of
divine
providence
as
far
as
it
may
conduce
to
the
solid
instruction
and
consolation
of
the
faithful
for
to
satisfy
a
vain
curiosity
is
neither
possible
nor
desirable
enough
would
now
have
been
said
were
it
not
for
a
difficulty
arising
from
a
few
passages
which
apparently
imply
in
opposition
to
what
has
been
stated
that
the
counsel
of
god
is
not
firm
and
stable
but
liable
to
change
according
to
the
situation
of
sublunary
affairs
in
the
first
place
there
are
several
instances
in
which
repentance
is
attributed
to
god
as
that
he
repented
of
having
created
man
and
of
having
exalted
saul
to
the
kingdom
and
that
he
will
repent
of
the
evil
which
he
had
determined
to
inflict
on
his
people
as
soon
as
he
shall
have
perceived
their
conversion
in
the
next
place
we
read
of
the
abrogation
of
some
of
his
decrees
by
jonah
he
declared
to
the
ninevites
that
after
the
lapse
of
forty
days
nineveh
should
be
destroyed
but
their
penitence
afterwards
obtained
from
him
a
more
merciful
sentence
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
he
denounced
death
to
hezekiah
which
the
prayers
and
tears
of
that
monarch
moved
him
to
defer
hence
many
persons
argue
that
god
has
not
fixed
the
affairs
of
men
by
an
eternal
decree
but
that
every
year
day
and
hour
he
decrees
one
thing
or
another
according
to
the
respective
merits
of
each
individual
or
to
his
own
ideas
of
equity
and
justice
with
regard
to
repentance
we
must
not
admit
that
it
can
happen
to
god
any
more
than
ignorance
or
error
or
impotence
for
if
no
man
knowingly
and
willingly
lays
himself
under
the
necessity
of
repentance
we
can
not
attribute
repentance
to
god
without
saying
either
that
he
is
ignorant
of
the
future
or
that
he
can
not
avoid
it
or
that
he
precipitately
and
inconsiderately
adopts
a
resolution
of
which
he
immediately
repents
but
that
is
so
far
from
the
meaning
of
the
holy
spirit
that
in
the
very
mention
of
repentance
he
denies
that
it
can
belong
to
god
because
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
and
it
must
be
remarked
that
both
these
points
are
so
connected
in
the
same
chapter
that
a
comparison
fully
reconciles
the
apparent
inconsistency
where
it
is
said
that
god
repented
of
having
created
saul
king
the
change
declared
to
have
taken
place
is
figurative
it
is
almost
immediately
added
that
the
strength
of
israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent
for
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
repent
in
which
without
any
figure
his
immutability
is
plainly
asserted
it
is
certain
therefore
that
the
ordination
of
god
in
the
administration
of
human
affairs
is
perpetual
and
superior
to
all
repentance
and
to
place
his
constancy
beyond
all
doubt
even
his
adversaries
have
been
constrained
to
attest
it
for
balaam
notwithstanding
his
reluctance
was
obliged
to
break
out
into
the
following
exclamation
god
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
lie
neither
the
son
of
man
that
he
should
repent
hath
he
said
and
shall
he
not
do
it
or
hath
he
spoken
and
shall
he
not
make
it
good
xiii
how
then
it
will
be
inquired
is
the
term
to
be
understood
when
attributed
to
god
i
reply
in
the
same
manner
as
all
the
other
forms
of
expression
which
describe
god
to
us
after
the
manner
of
men
for
since
our
infirmity
can
not
reach
his
sublimity
the
description
of
him
which
is
given
to
us
in
order
that
we
may
understand
it
must
be
lowered
to
the
level
of
our
capacity
his
method
of
lowering
it
is
to
represent
himself
to
us
not
as
he
is
in
himself
but
according
to
our
perception
of
him
though
he
is
free
from
all
perturbation
of
mind
he
declares
that
he
is
angry
with
sinners
as
therefore
when
we
hear
that
god
is
angry
we
ought
not
to
imagine
any
commotion
in
him
but
rather
to
consider
this
expression
as
borrowed
from
our
perception
because
god
carries
the
appearance
of
one
who
is
very
angry
whenever
he
executes
judgment
neither
by
the
term
ought
we
to
understand
any
thing
but
a
change
of
actions
because
men
are
accustomed
to
express
their
dissatisfaction
with
themselves
by
changing
their
actions
since
every
change
among
men
therefore
is
a
correction
of
that
which
displeases
them
and
correction
proceeds
from
repentance
therefore
the
term
is
used
to
signify
that
god
makes
a
change
in
his
works
yet
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
alteration
in
his
counsel
or
his
will
nor
any
change
in
his
affections
but
how
sudden
soever
the
variation
may
appear
to
the
eyes
of
men
he
perpetually
and
regularly
prosecutes
what
he
has
foreseen
approved
and
decreed
from
eternity
xiv
nor
does
the
sacred
history
when
it
records
the
remission
of
the
destruction
which
had
just
been
denounced
against
the
ninevites
and
the
prolongation
of
the
life
of
hezekiah
after
he
had
been
threatened
with
death
prove
that
there
was
any
abrogation
of
the
divine
decrees
persons
who
thus
understand
it
are
deceived
in
their
ideas
of
the
threatenings
which
though
expressed
in
the
form
of
simple
declarations
yet
as
the
event
shows
contain
in
them
a
tacit
condition
for
why
did
god
send
jonah
to
the
ninevites
to
predict
the
ruin
of
their
city
why
did
he
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
warn
hezekiah
of
death
he
could
have
destroyed
both
them
and
him
without
previously
announcing
their
end
he
had
some
other
object
in
view
therefore
than
to
forewarn
them
of
their
death
and
to
give
them
a
distant
prospect
of
its
approach
and
that
was
not
to
destroy
them
but
to
reform
them
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
therefore
the
prediction
of
jonah
that
after
forty
days
nineveh
should
fall
was
uttered
to
prevent
its
fall
hezekiah
was
deprived
of
the
hope
of
a
longer
life
in
order
that
he
might
obtain
a
prolongation
of
it
in
answer
to
his
prayers
now
who
does
not
see
that
the
lord
by
such
denunciations
as
these
intended
to
arouse
to
repentance
the
persons
whom
he
thus
alarmed
that
they
might
escape
the
judgment
which
their
sins
had
deserved
if
this
be
admitted
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
we
must
understand
a
tacit
condition
implied
in
the
simple
denunciation
this
is
also
confirmed
by
similar
examples
the
lord
reprehending
king
abimelech
for
having
deprived
abraham
of
his
wife
uses
these
words
behold
thou
art
but
a
dead
man
for
the
woman
which
thou
hast
taken
for
she
is
a
man
s
but
after
abimelech
has
excused
himself
the
lord
speaks
in
this
manner
restore
the
man
his
wife
for
he
is
a
prophet
and
he
shall
pray
for
thee
and
thou
shalt
live
and
if
thou
restore
her
not
know
thou
that
thou
shalt
surely
die
thou
and
all
that
are
you
see
how
by
the
first
declaration
god
terrifies
his
mind
to
dispose
him
to
make
satisfaction
but
in
the
next
he
makes
an
explicit
declaration
of
his
will
since
other
passages
are
to
be
explained
in
a
similar
manner
you
must
not
infer
that
there
is
any
abrogation
of
a
prior
purpose
of
the
lord
because
he
may
have
annulled
some
former
declarations
for
god
rather
prepares
the
way
for
his
eternal
ordination
when
by
a
denunciation
of
punishment
he
calls
to
repentance
those
whom
he
designs
to
spare
than
makes
any
variation
in
his
will
or
even
in
his
declarations
except
that
he
does
not
syllabically
express
what
nevertheless
is
easily
understood
for
that
assertion
of
isaiah
must
remain
true
the
lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
and
who
shall
disannul
it
and
his
hand
is
stretched
out
and
who
shall
turn
it
back
chapter
xviii
god
uses
the
agency
of
the
impious
and
inclines
their
minds
to
execute
his
judgments
yet
without
the
least
stain
of
his
perfect
purity
a
question
of
greater
difficulty
arises
from
other
passages
where
god
is
said
to
incline
or
draw
according
to
his
own
pleasure
satan
himself
and
all
the
reprobate
for
the
carnal
understanding
scarcely
comprehends
how
he
acting
by
their
means
contracts
no
defilement
from
their
criminality
and
even
in
operations
common
to
himself
and
them
is
free
from
every
fault
and
yet
righteously
condemns
those
whose
ministry
he
uses
hence
was
invented
the
distinction
between
and
because
to
many
persons
this
has
appeared
an
inexplicable
difficulty
that
satan
and
all
the
impious
are
subject
to
the
power
and
government
of
god
so
that
he
directs
their
malice
to
whatever
end
he
pleases
and
uses
their
crimes
for
the
execution
of
his
judgments
the
modesty
of
those
who
are
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
absurdity
might
perhaps
be
excusable
if
they
did
not
attempt
to
vindicate
the
divine
justice
from
all
accusation
by
a
pretence
utterly
destitute
of
any
foundation
in
truth
they
consider
it
absurd
that
a
man
should
be
blinded
by
the
will
and
command
of
god
and
afterwards
be
punished
for
his
blindness
they
therefore
evade
the
difficulty
by
alleging
that
it
happens
only
by
the
permission
and
not
by
the
will
of
god
but
god
himself
by
the
most
unequivocal
declarations
rejects
this
subterfuge
that
men
however
can
effect
nothing
but
by
the
secret
will
of
god
and
can
deliberate
on
nothing
but
what
he
has
previously
decreed
and
determines
by
his
secret
direction
is
proved
by
express
and
innumerable
testimonies
what
we
have
before
cited
from
the
psalmist
that
god
hath
done
whatsoever
he
hath
pleased
undoubtedly
pertains
to
all
the
actions
of
men
if
god
be
the
certain
arbiter
of
war
and
peace
as
is
there
affirmed
and
that
without
any
exception
who
will
venture
to
assert
that
he
remains
ignorant
and
unconcerned
respecting
men
while
they
are
actuated
by
the
blind
influence
of
chance
but
this
subject
will
be
better
elucidated
by
particular
examples
from
the
first
chapter
of
job
we
know
that
satan
presents
himself
before
god
to
receive
his
commands
as
well
as
the
angels
who
yield
a
spontaneous
obedience
it
is
indeed
in
a
different
manner
and
for
a
different
end
yet
he
can
not
attempt
any
thing
but
by
the
divine
will
although
he
seems
to
obtain
only
a
bare
permission
to
afflict
that
holy
man
yet
since
this
sentence
is
true
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
we
conclude
that
god
was
the
author
of
that
trial
of
which
satan
and
mischievous
robbers
and
assassins
were
the
immediate
agents
satan
endeavours
to
drive
him
by
desperation
into
madness
the
sabeans
in
a
predatory
incursion
cruelly
and
wickedly
seize
upon
property
not
their
own
job
acknowledges
that
he
was
stripped
of
all
his
wealth
and
reduced
to
poverty
because
such
was
the
will
of
god
therefore
whatever
is
attempted
by
men
or
by
satan
himself
god
still
holds
the
helm
to
direct
all
their
attempts
to
the
execution
of
his
judgments
god
intends
the
deception
of
that
perfidious
king
ahab
the
devil
offers
his
service
for
that
purpose
he
is
sent
with
a
positive
commission
to
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
the
prophets
if
the
blinding
and
infatuation
of
ahab
be
a
divine
judgment
the
pretence
of
bare
permission
disappears
for
it
would
be
ridiculous
for
a
judge
merely
to
permit
without
decreeing
what
should
be
done
and
commanding
his
officers
to
execute
it
the
jews
designed
to
destroy
christ
pilate
and
his
soldiers
complied
with
their
outrageous
violence
yet
the
disciples
in
a
solemn
prayer
confess
that
all
the
impious
did
nothing
but
what
the
hand
and
the
counsel
of
god
determined
before
to
be
done
agreeably
to
what
peter
had
already
preached
that
he
was
delivered
by
the
determinate
counsel
and
foreknowledge
of
god
that
he
might
be
crucified
and
as
though
he
had
said
that
god
who
saw
every
thing
from
the
beginning
with
a
clear
knowledge
and
determined
will
appointed
what
the
jews
executed
as
he
mentions
in
another
place
those
things
which
god
before
had
showed
by
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
that
christ
should
suffer
he
hath
so
absalom
defiling
his
father
s
bed
with
incest
perpetrated
a
detestable
crime
yet
god
pronounces
that
this
was
his
work
for
his
words
are
thou
didst
it
secretly
but
i
will
do
this
thing
before
all
israel
and
before
the
whatever
cruelty
the
chaldeans
exercised
in
judea
jeremiah
pronounces
to
be
the
work
of
god
for
which
reason
nebuchadnezzar
is
called
the
servant
of
god
god
frequently
proclaims
that
the
impious
are
excited
to
war
by
his
hissing
by
the
sound
of
his
trumpet
by
his
influence
and
by
his
command
he
calls
the
assyrian
the
rod
of
his
anger
and
the
staff
which
he
moves
with
his
hand
the
destruction
of
the
holy
city
and
the
ruin
of
the
temple
he
calls
his
own
work
david
not
murmuring
against
god
but
acknowledging
him
to
be
a
righteous
judge
confesses
the
maledictions
of
shimei
to
proceed
from
his
command
the
lord
says
he
hath
said
unto
him
it
often
occurs
in
the
sacred
history
that
whatever
comes
to
pass
proceeds
from
the
lord
as
the
defection
of
the
ten
tribes
the
death
of
the
sons
of
eli
and
many
events
of
a
similar
kind
those
who
are
but
moderately
acquainted
with
the
scriptures
will
perceive
that
for
the
sake
of
brevity
out
of
a
great
number
of
testimonies
i
have
produced
only
a
few
which
nevertheless
abundantly
evince
how
nugatory
and
insipid
it
is
instead
of
the
providence
of
god
to
substitute
a
bare
permission
as
though
god
were
sitting
in
a
watchtower
expecting
fortuitous
events
and
so
his
decisions
were
dependent
on
the
will
of
men
ii
with
respect
to
his
secret
influences
the
declaration
of
solomon
concerning
the
heart
of
a
king
that
it
is
inclined
hither
or
thither
according
to
the
divine
will
certainly
extends
to
the
whole
human
race
and
is
as
much
as
though
he
had
said
that
whatever
conceptions
we
form
in
our
minds
they
are
directed
by
the
secret
inspiration
of
god
and
certainly
if
he
did
not
operate
internally
on
the
human
mind
there
would
be
no
propriety
in
asserting
that
he
causes
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
to
perish
and
the
understanding
of
the
prudent
to
be
hid
that
he
poureth
contempt
upon
princes
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
the
wilderness
where
there
is
no
and
to
this
alludes
what
we
frequently
read
that
men
are
timorous
as
their
hearts
are
possessed
with
his
fear
thus
david
departed
from
the
camp
of
saul
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
because
a
deep
sleep
from
the
lord
was
fallen
upon
them
but
nothing
can
be
desired
more
explicit
than
his
frequent
declarations
that
he
blinds
the
minds
of
men
strikes
them
with
giddiness
inebriates
them
with
the
spirit
of
slumber
fills
them
with
infatuation
and
hardens
their
hearts
these
passages
also
many
persons
refer
to
permission
as
though
in
abandoning
the
reprobate
god
permitted
them
to
be
blinded
by
satan
but
that
solution
is
too
frivolous
since
the
holy
spirit
expressly
declares
that
their
blindness
and
infatuation
are
inflicted
by
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
he
is
said
to
have
caused
the
obduracy
of
pharaoh
s
heart
and
also
to
have
aggravated
and
confirmed
it
some
elude
the
force
of
these
expressions
with
a
foolish
since
pharaoh
himself
is
elsewhere
said
to
have
hardened
his
own
heart
his
own
will
is
stated
as
the
cause
of
his
obduracy
as
though
these
two
things
were
at
all
incompatible
with
each
other
that
man
should
be
actuated
by
god
and
yet
at
the
same
time
be
active
himself
but
i
retort
on
them
their
own
objection
for
if
denotes
a
bare
permission
pharaoh
can
not
properly
be
charged
with
being
the
cause
of
his
own
obstinacy
now
how
weak
and
insipid
would
be
such
an
interpretation
as
though
pharaoh
only
permitted
himself
to
be
hardened
besides
the
scripture
cuts
off
all
occasion
for
such
cavils
god
says
i
will
harden
his
so
also
moses
says
concerning
the
inhabitants
of
canaan
that
they
marched
forth
to
battle
because
the
lord
had
hardened
their
hearts
which
is
likewise
repeated
by
another
he
turned
their
hearts
to
hate
his
thus
also
in
isaiah
he
declares
he
will
send
the
assyrian
against
a
hypocritical
nation
and
will
give
him
a
charge
to
take
the
spoil
and
to
take
the
prey
not
that
he
meant
to
teach
impious
and
refractory
men
a
voluntary
obedience
but
because
he
would
incline
them
to
execute
his
judgments
just
as
if
they
had
his
commands
engraven
on
their
minds
hence
it
appears
that
they
were
impelled
by
the
positive
appointment
of
god
i
grant
indeed
that
god
often
actuates
the
reprobate
by
the
interposition
of
satan
but
in
such
a
manner
that
satan
himself
acts
his
part
by
the
divine
impulse
and
proceeds
to
the
extent
of
the
divine
appointment
saul
was
disturbed
by
an
evil
spirit
but
it
is
said
to
be
from
the
lord
to
teach
us
that
saul
s
madness
proceeded
from
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
satan
is
also
said
to
blind
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
but
the
strength
of
the
delusion
proceeds
from
god
himself
that
they
should
believe
a
lie
who
believe
not
the
according
to
one
view
of
the
subject
it
is
said
if
the
prophet
be
deceived
when
he
hath
spoken
a
thing
i
the
lord
have
deceived
that
but
according
to
another
god
is
said
himself
to
give
men
over
to
a
reprobate
mind
and
to
the
vilest
lusts
because
he
is
the
principal
author
of
his
own
righteous
vengeance
and
satan
is
only
the
dispenser
of
it
but
as
we
must
discuss
this
subject
again
in
the
second
book
where
we
shall
treat
of
the
freedom
or
slavery
of
the
human
will
i
think
i
have
now
said
in
a
brief
manner
as
much
as
the
occasion
required
the
whole
may
be
summed
up
thus
that
as
the
will
of
god
is
said
to
be
the
cause
of
all
things
his
providence
is
established
as
the
governor
in
all
the
counsels
and
works
of
men
so
that
it
not
only
exerts
its
power
in
the
elect
who
are
influenced
by
the
holy
spirit
but
also
compels
the
compliance
of
the
reprobate
iii
but
as
i
have
hitherto
only
recited
such
things
as
are
delivered
without
any
obscurity
or
ambiguity
in
the
scriptures
let
persons
who
hesitate
not
to
brand
with
ignominy
those
oracles
of
heaven
beware
what
kind
of
opposition
they
make
for
if
they
pretend
ignorance
with
a
desire
to
be
commended
for
their
modesty
what
greater
instance
of
pride
can
be
conceived
than
to
oppose
one
little
word
to
the
authority
of
god
as
it
appears
otherwise
to
me
or
i
would
rather
not
meddle
with
this
but
if
they
openly
censure
what
will
they
gain
by
their
puny
attempts
against
heaven
their
petulance
indeed
is
no
novelty
for
in
all
ages
there
have
been
impious
and
profane
men
who
have
virulently
opposed
this
doctrine
but
they
shall
feel
the
truth
of
what
the
spirit
long
ago
declared
by
the
mouth
of
david
that
god
is
clear
when
he
david
obliquely
hints
at
the
madness
of
men
who
display
such
excessive
presumption
amidst
their
insignificance
as
not
only
to
dispute
against
god
but
to
arrogate
to
themselves
the
power
of
condemning
him
in
the
mean
time
he
briefly
suggests
that
god
is
unaffected
by
all
the
blasphemies
which
they
discharge
against
heaven
but
that
he
dissipates
the
mists
of
calumny
and
illustriously
displays
his
righteousness
our
faith
also
being
founded
on
the
divine
word
and
therefore
superior
to
all
the
world
from
its
exaltation
looks
down
with
contempt
upon
those
mists
for
their
first
objection
that
if
nothing
happens
but
by
the
will
of
god
he
has
in
him
two
contrary
wills
because
he
decrees
in
his
secret
counsel
what
he
has
publicly
prohibited
in
his
law
is
easily
refuted
but
before
i
reply
i
wish
the
reader
again
to
be
apprized
that
this
cavil
is
directed
not
against
me
but
against
the
holy
spirit
who
dictated
to
the
pious
job
this
confession
that
what
had
befallen
him
had
happened
according
to
the
divine
will
when
he
had
been
plundered
by
banditti
he
acknowledged
in
their
injuries
the
righteous
scourge
of
god
what
says
the
scripture
in
another
case
they
the
sons
of
eli
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
their
father
because
the
lord
would
slay
the
psalmist
also
exclaims
that
god
who
is
in
the
heavens
hath
done
whatsoever
he
hath
and
now
i
have
sufficiently
proved
that
god
is
called
the
author
of
all
those
things
which
according
to
the
system
of
these
censors
happen
only
by
his
uninfluential
permission
he
declares
that
he
creates
light
and
darkness
that
he
forms
good
and
evil
and
that
no
evil
occurs
which
he
has
not
performed
let
them
say
then
whether
he
exercises
his
judgments
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
but
as
moses
suggests
that
he
who
is
killed
by
the
fortuitous
fall
of
an
axe
is
delivered
by
god
to
the
stroke
so
in
the
acts
the
whole
church
asserts
that
herod
and
pilate
conspired
to
do
what
the
hand
and
the
counsel
of
god
had
predetermined
and
indeed
unless
the
crucifixion
of
christ
was
according
to
the
will
of
god
what
becomes
of
our
redemption
yet
the
will
of
god
is
neither
repugnant
to
itself
nor
subject
to
change
nor
chargeable
with
pretending
to
dislike
what
it
approves
but
whilst
in
him
it
is
uniform
and
simple
it
wears
to
us
the
appearance
of
variety
because
the
weakness
of
our
understanding
comprehends
not
how
the
same
thing
may
be
in
different
respects
both
agreeable
to
his
will
and
contrary
to
it
paul
after
having
said
that
the
vocation
of
the
gentiles
was
a
hidden
mystery
adds
that
it
contained
a
manifestation
of
the
manifold
wisdom
of
god
now
because
through
the
dulness
of
our
capacity
the
divine
wisdom
appears
to
us
manifold
or
multiform
as
it
has
been
translated
by
an
ancient
interpreter
shall
we
therefore
dream
of
any
vanity
in
god
himself
as
though
his
counsels
were
mutable
or
his
thoughts
contradictory
to
each
other
rather
while
we
comprehend
not
how
god
intends
that
to
be
done
the
doing
of
which
he
forbids
let
us
remember
our
imbecility
and
at
the
same
time
consider
that
the
light
which
he
inhabits
is
justly
called
inaccessible
because
it
is
overspread
with
impenetrable
darkness
therefore
all
pious
and
modest
men
will
easily
acquiesce
in
this
opinion
of
augustine
that
a
man
may
sometimes
choose
with
a
good
intention
that
which
is
not
agreeable
to
the
will
of
god
as
if
a
good
son
wishes
his
father
to
live
whilst
god
determines
that
he
shall
die
it
is
also
possible
for
a
man
to
will
with
a
bad
design
what
god
wills
with
a
good
one
as
if
a
bad
son
wishes
his
father
to
die
which
is
also
the
will
of
god
now
the
former
wishes
what
is
not
agreeable
the
latter
what
is
agreeable
to
the
divine
will
and
yet
the
filial
affection
of
the
former
is
more
consonant
to
the
righteous
will
of
god
than
the
want
of
natural
affection
in
the
latter
though
it
accords
with
his
secret
design
so
great
is
the
difference
between
what
belongs
to
the
human
will
and
what
to
the
divine
and
between
the
ends
to
which
the
will
of
every
one
is
to
be
referred
for
approbation
or
censure
for
god
fulfils
his
righteous
will
by
the
wicked
wills
of
wicked
this
writer
had
just
before
said
that
the
apostate
angels
and
all
the
reprobate
in
their
defection
acted
as
far
as
respected
themselves
in
direct
opposition
to
the
divine
will
but
that
this
was
not
possible
with
respect
to
the
divine
omnipotence
because
while
they
are
opposing
the
will
of
god
his
will
is
accomplished
concerning
them
whence
he
exclaims
the
works
of
the
lord
are
great
prepared
according
to
all
his
determinations
so
that
in
a
wonderful
and
ineffable
manner
that
is
not
done
without
his
will
which
yet
is
contrary
to
his
will
because
it
would
not
be
done
if
he
did
not
permit
it
and
this
permission
is
not
involuntary
but
voluntary
nor
would
his
goodness
permit
the
perpetration
of
any
evil
unless
his
omnipotence
were
able
even
from
that
evil
to
educe
good
iv
in
the
same
manner
we
answer
or
rather
annihilate
another
if
god
not
only
uses
the
agency
of
the
impious
but
governs
their
designs
and
affections
he
is
the
author
of
all
crimes
and
therefore
men
are
undeservedly
condemned
if
they
execute
what
god
has
decreed
because
they
obey
his
will
for
his
will
is
improperly
confounded
with
his
precept
between
which
innumerable
examples
evince
the
difference
to
be
very
great
for
although
when
absalom
defiled
the
wives
of
his
father
it
was
the
will
of
god
by
this
disgrace
to
punish
the
adultery
of
david
he
did
not
therefore
command
that
abandoned
son
to
commit
incest
unless
perhaps
with
respect
to
david
as
he
speaks
of
the
reproaches
of
shimei
for
when
he
confesses
shimei
s
maledictions
to
proceed
from
the
divine
command
he
by
no
means
commends
his
obedience
as
though
that
impudent
and
worthless
man
were
fulfilling
a
divine
precept
but
acknowledging
his
tongue
as
the
scourge
of
god
he
patiently
submits
to
the
chastisement
let
it
be
remembered
that
whilst
god
by
means
of
the
impious
fulfils
his
secret
decrees
they
are
not
excusable
as
though
they
were
obedient
to
his
precepts
which
they
wantonly
and
intentionally
violate
the
direction
of
the
perverse
actions
of
men
by
the
secret
providence
of
god
is
illustriously
exemplified
in
the
election
of
jeroboam
to
the
regal
dignity
the
temerity
and
infatuation
of
the
people
in
this
proceeding
are
severely
condemned
because
they
perverted
the
order
established
by
god
and
perfidiously
revolted
from
the
family
of
david
and
yet
we
know
that
this
event
was
agreeable
to
the
divine
will
whence
there
is
an
appearance
of
contradiction
also
in
the
language
of
hosea
for
in
one
place
god
complains
that
the
erection
of
that
kingdom
was
without
his
knowledge
and
against
his
will
but
in
another
declares
that
he
gave
jeroboam
to
be
a
king
in
his
anger
how
can
these
things
be
reconciled
that
jeroboam
did
not
reign
by
the
will
of
god
and
yet
that
god
appointed
him
to
be
king
why
thus
because
neither
could
the
people
revolt
from
the
family
of
david
without
shaking
off
the
yoke
which
god
had
imposed
upon
them
nor
yet
was
god
deprived
of
the
liberty
of
thus
punishing
the
ingratitude
of
solomon
we
see
then
how
god
while
he
hates
perfidy
yet
righteously
and
with
a
different
design
decrees
the
defection
whence
also
jeroboam
is
beyond
all
expectation
constrained
by
the
holy
unction
to
assume
the
regal
office
in
the
same
manner
the
sacred
history
relates
that
god
raised
up
an
enemy
to
deprive
the
son
of
solomon
of
part
of
the
kingdom
let
the
reader
diligently
consider
both
these
things
because
it
had
pleased
god
that
the
people
should
be
under
the
government
of
one
king
their
division
into
two
parts
was
contrary
to
his
will
and
yet
from
his
will
the
schism
first
originated
for
certainly
since
a
prophet
both
by
a
prediction
and
by
the
ceremony
of
unction
excited
a
hope
of
succeeding
to
the
kingdom
in
the
mind
of
jeroboam
who
before
entertained
not
a
thought
of
such
an
event
this
could
not
be
done
either
without
the
knowledge
or
against
the
will
of
god
who
commanded
it
to
be
done
and
yet
the
rebellion
of
the
people
is
justly
condemned
because
in
opposition
to
the
divine
will
they
revolted
from
the
posterity
of
david
thus
also
it
is
afterwards
subjoined
that
the
cause
of
the
haughty
contempt
of
the
people
manifested
by
rehoboam
was
of
god
that
the
lord
might
perform
his
word
which
he
spake
by
the
hand
of
ahijah
his
servant
see
how
the
sacred
union
is
divided
in
opposition
to
the
will
of
god
and
yet
by
his
will
the
ten
tribes
are
alienated
from
the
son
of
solomon
let
us
add
another
similar
example
where
with
the
consent
and
even
by
the
assistance
of
the
people
the
sons
of
ahab
are
massacred
and
all
his
posterity
exterminated
jehu
indeed
truly
observed
that
there
had
fallen
unto
the
earth
nothing
of
the
word
of
the
lord
but
that
he
had
done
that
which
he
spake
by
his
servant
and
yet
he
justly
reprehends
the
citizens
of
samaria
for
having
lent
their
assistance
are
ye
righteous
says
he
behold
i
conspired
against
my
master
and
slew
him
but
who
slew
all
these
if
i
am
not
deceived
i
have
now
clearly
explained
how
the
same
act
displays
the
criminality
of
men
and
the
justice
of
god
and
to
modest
minds
this
answer
of
augustine
will
always
be
sufficient
since
god
delivered
christ
and
christ
delivered
his
own
body
and
judas
delivered
the
lord
why
in
this
delivery
is
god
righteous
and
man
guilty
because
in
the
same
act
they
acted
not
from
the
same
but
if
any
persons
find
greater
difficulty
in
what
we
now
assert
that
there
is
no
consent
between
god
and
man
in
cases
where
man
by
his
righteous
influence
commits
unlawful
actions
let
them
remember
what
is
advanced
by
augustine
in
another
place
who
can
but
tremble
at
those
judgments
when
god
does
even
in
the
hearts
of
the
wicked
whatsoever
he
pleases
and
yet
renders
to
them
according
to
their
demerits
and
certainly
it
would
no
more
be
right
to
attribute
to
god
the
blame
of
the
perfidy
of
judas
because
he
decreed
the
delivery
of
his
son
and
actually
delivered
him
to
death
than
to
transfer
to
judas
the
praise
of
redemption
therefore
the
same
writer
elsewhere
informs
us
that
in
this
scrutiny
god
inquires
not
what
men
could
have
done
nor
what
they
have
done
but
what
they
intended
to
do
that
he
may
take
cognizance
of
their
design
and
their
will
let
those
to
whom
there
appears
any
harshness
in
this
procedure
consider
a
little
how
far
their
obstinacy
is
tolerable
while
they
reject
a
truth
which
is
attested
by
plain
testimonies
of
scripture
because
it
exceeds
their
comprehension
and
condemn
the
publication
of
those
things
which
god
unless
he
had
known
that
the
knowledge
of
them
would
be
useful
would
never
have
commanded
to
be
taught
by
his
prophets
and
apostles
for
our
wisdom
ought
to
consist
in
embracing
with
gentle
docility
and
without
any
exception
all
that
is
delivered
in
the
sacred
scriptures
but
those
who
oppose
this
doctrine
with
less
modesty
and
greater
violence
since
it
is
evident
that
their
opposition
is
against
god
are
unworthy
of
a
longer
refutation
book

on
the

which
was

first
to
the

is

another
on

knowledge
of

the
redeemer
in

which
is
the
subject
of
this

it
treats
first
of
the
occasion
of

that
is
the
fall
of

secondly
of

the

are
assigned

it
treats

of

fall
in
general
but
also
of
its
effects

of
the
objections
commonly
adduced
in
defence
of

the
discourse
on

may
be
divided

five
principal
parts
it
shows
in
whom
salvation
must
be
sought
by
lost
man
that
is
in
vi
how
christ
has
been
manifested
to
the
world
which
has
been
in
two
ways
first
under
the
law
which
introduces
an
explanation
of
the
decalogue
and
a
discussion
of
some
other
things
relative
to
the
law
vii
viii
secondly
under
the
gospel
which
leads
to
a
statement
of
the
similarity
and
difference
of
the
two
what
kind
of
a
being
it
was
necessary
for
christ
to
be
in
order
to
his
fulfilment
of
the
office
of
a
mediator
that
is
god
and
man
in
one
the
end
of
his
mission
from
the
father
into
the
which
explains
his
prophetical
regal
and
sacerdotal
offices
the
methods
or
steps
by
which
he
fulfilled

part
of

at

and
the

doctrine
then
follows
chap
a
solution
of
the
question
whether
christ
merited
for
us
the
grace
of
god
and
salvation
chapter
i
the
fall
and
defection
of
adam
the
cause
of
the
curse
inflicted
on
all
mankind
and
of
their
degeneracy
from
their
primitive
condition
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
there
is
much
reason
in
the
old
adage
which
so
strongly
recommends
to
man
the
knowledge
of
himself
for
if
it
be
thought
disgraceful
to
be
ignorant
of
whatever
relates
to
the
conduct
of
human
life
ignorance
of
ourselves
is
much
more
shameful
which
causes
us
in
deliberating
on
subjects
of
importance
to
grope
our
way
in
miserable
obscurity
or
even
in
total
darkness
but
in
proportion
to
the
utility
of
this
precept
ought
to
be
our
caution
not
to
make
a
preposterous
use
of
it
as
we
see
some
philosophers
have
done
for
while
they
exhort
man
to
the
knowledge
of
himself
the
end
they
propose
is
that
he
may
not
remain
ignorant
of
his
own
dignity
and
excellence
nor
do
they
wish
him
to
contemplate
in
himself
any
thing
but
what
may
swell
him
with
vain
confidence
and
inflate
him
with
pride
but
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
consists
first
in
considering
what
was
bestowed
on
us
at
our
creation
and
the
favours
we
continually
receive
from
the
divine
benignity
that
we
may
know
how
great
the
excellence
of
our
nature
would
have
been
if
it
had
retained
its
integrity
yet
at
the
same
time
recollecting
that
we
have
nothing
properly
our
own
may
feel
our
precarious
tenure
of
all
that
god
has
conferred
on
us
so
as
always
to
place
our
dependence
upon
him
secondly
we
should
contemplate
our
miserable
condition
since
the
fall
of
adam
the
sense
of
which
tends
to
destroy
all
boasting
and
confidence
to
overwhelm
us
with
shame
and
to
fill
us
with
real
humility
for
as
god
at
the
beginning
formed
us
after
his
own
image
that
he
might
elevate
our
minds
both
to
the
practice
of
virtue
and
to
the
contemplation
of
eternal
life
so
to
prevent
the
great
excellence
of
our
species
which
distinguishes
us
from
the
brutes
from
being
buried
in
sottish
indolence
it
is
worthy
of
observation
that
the
design
of
our
being
endued
with
reason
and
intelligence
is
that
leading
a
holy
and
virtuous
life
we
may
aspire
to
the
mark
set
before
us
of
a
blessed
immortality
but
we
can
not
think
upon
that
primeval
dignity
without
having
our
attention
immediately
called
to
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
our
disgrace
and
ignominy
since
in
the
person
of
the
first
man
we
are
fallen
from
our
original
condition
hence
arise
disapprobation
and
abhorrence
of
ourselves
and
real
humility
and
we
are
inflamed
with
fresh
ardour
to
seek
after
god
to
recover
in
him
those
excellences
of
which
we
find
ourselves
utterly
destitute
ii
this
is
what
the
truth
of
god
directs
us
to
seek
in
the
examination
of
ourselves
it
requires
a
knowledge
that
will
abstract
us
from
all
confidence
in
our
own
ability
deprive
us
of
every
cause
of
boasting
and
reduce
us
to
submission
we
must
observe
this
rule
if
we
wish
to
reach
the
proper
point
of
knowledge
and
action
i
am
aware
of
the
superior
plausibility
of
that
opinion
which
invites
us
rather
to
a
consideration
of
our
goodness
than
to
a
view
of
our
miserable
poverty
and
ignominy
which
ought
to
overwhelm
us
with
shame
for
there
is
nothing
more
desired
by
the
human
mind
than
soothing
flatteries
and
therefore
it
listens
with
extreme
credulity
to
hear
its
excellences
magnified
wherefore
it
is
the
less
wonderful
that
the
majority
of
mankind
have
fallen
into
such
a
pernicious
error
for
an
immoderate
being
innate
in
all
men
they
readily
persuade
themselves
that
there
is
nothing
in
them
which
justly
deserves
to
be
an
object
of
aversion
thus
without
any
extraneous
support
this
very
false
opinion
that
man
has
in
himself
sufficient
ability
to
insure
his
own
virtue
and
happiness
generally
prevails
but
if
some
prefer
more
modest
sentiments
though
they
concede
something
to
god
in
order
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
arrogating
every
thing
to
themselves
yet
they
make
such
a
distribution
that
the
principal
cause
of
boasting
and
confidence
always
remains
with
them
if
they
hear
any
discourse
that
flatters
the
pride
already
operating
spontaneously
in
their
hearts
nothing
can
gratify
them
more
therefore
every
one
who
in
his
preaching
has
kindly
extolled
the
excellence
of
human
nature
has
received
great
applause
from
almost
all
ages
but
such
a
commendation
of
human
excellence
as
teaches
man
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
only
enamours
him
of
his
own
amiableness
and
thus
produces
an
illusion
which
involves
those
who
assent
to
it
in
most
dreadful
perdition
for
to
what
purpose
is
it
for
us
relying
on
every
vain
confidence
to
deliberate
to
determine
and
to
attempt
things
which
we
think
tend
to
our
advantage
and
in
our
first
efforts
to
find
ourselves
destitute
of
sound
understanding
and
true
virtue
yet
securely
to
proceed
till
we
fall
into
destruction
but
this
must
be
the
fate
of
all
who
confide
in
the
efficacy
of
their
own
virtue
whosoever
therefore
attends
to
such
teachers
as
amuse
us
with
a
mere
exhibition
of
our
virtues
will
make
no
progress
in
the
knowledge
of
himself
but
will
be
absorbed
in
the
most
pernicious
ignorance
iii
therefore
whilst
the
truth
of
god
agrees
in
this
point
with
the
common
consent
of
all
mankind
that
the
second
branch
of
wisdom
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
yet
with
respect
to
the
knowledge
itself
there
is
no
small
disagreement
for
according
to
carnal
apprehension
a
man
is
thought
to
be
well
acquainted
with
himself
when
confiding
in
his
own
understanding
and
integrity
he
assumes
a
presumptuous
boldness
incites
himself
to
the
duties
of
virtue
and
declaring
war
against
vice
uses
his
most
strenuous
endeavours
to
adhere
to
what
is
fair
and
honourable
but
he
who
inspects
and
examines
himself
by
the
rule
of
the
divine
judgment
finds
nothing
that
can
raise
his
mind
to
a
genuine
confidence
and
the
more
fully
he
has
examined
himself
the
greater
is
his
dejection
till
entirely
discarding
all
confidence
he
leaves
himself
no
ability
for
the
proper
conduct
of
his
life
yet
it
is
not
the
will
of
god
that
we
should
forget
the
primitive
dignity
conferred
by
him
on
our
father
adam
which
ought
justly
to
awaken
us
to
the
pursuit
of
righteousness
and
goodness
for
we
can
not
reflect
on
our
original
condition
and
on
the
end
of
our
creation
without
being
excited
to
meditate
on
immortality
and
to
aspire
after
the
kingdom
of
god
but
this
reflection
is
so
far
from
elating
us
with
pride
that
it
rather
produces
humility
for
what
is
that
original
condition
that
from
which
we
are
fallen
what
is
that
end
of
our
creation
that
from
which
we
are
wholly
departed
so
that
we
should
lament
the
miseries
of
our
present
state
and
in
the
midst
of
our
lamentation
aspire
after
the
dignity
which
we
have
lost
now
when
we
say
that
man
should
behold
in
himself
nothing
that
might
elate
him
with
pride
we
mean
that
there
is
nothing
in
him
in
the
confidence
of
which
he
ought
to
be
proud
wherefore
we
may
divide
the
knowledge
man
ought
to
have
of
himself
into
these
two
parts
first
he
should
consider
the
end
of
his
being
created
and
endued
with
such
estimable
gifts
a
reflection
which
may
excite
him
to
the
consideration
of
divine
worship
and
of
a
future
life
secondly
he
should
examine
his
own
ability
or
rather
his
want
of
ability
the
view
of
which
may
confound
and
almost
annihilate
him
the
former
consideration
is
adapted
to
acquaint
him
with
his
duty
the
latter
with
his
power
to
perform
it
we
shall
treat
of
them
both
in
regular
order
iv
but
since
it
could
not
have
been
a
trivial
offence
but
must
have
been
a
detestable
crime
that
was
so
severely
punished
by
god
we
must
consider
the
nature
of
adam
s
sin
which
kindled
the
dreadful
flame
of
divine
wrath
against
the
whole
human
race
the
vulgar
opinion
concerning
the
intemperance
of
gluttony
is
quite
puerile
as
though
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
virtues
consisted
in
an
abstinence
from
one
particular
kind
of
fruit
when
there
were
diffused
on
every
side
all
the
delights
which
could
possibly
be
desired
and
the
happy
fecundity
of
the
earth
afforded
an
abundance
and
variety
of
dainties
we
must
therefore
look
further
because
the
prohibition
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
a
test
of
obedience
that
adam
might
prove
his
willing
submission
to
the
divine
government
and
the
name
itself
shows
that
the
precept
was
given
for
no
other
purpose
than
that
he
might
be
contented
with
his
condition
and
not
aim
with
criminal
cupidity
at
any
higher
but
the
promise
which
authorized
him
to
expect
eternal
life
as
long
as
he
should
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
and
on
the
other
hand
the
dreadful
denunciation
of
death
as
soon
as
he
should
taste
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
were
calculated
for
the
probation
and
exercise
of
his
faith
hence
it
is
easy
to
infer
by
what
means
adam
provoked
the
wrath
of
god
against
him
augustine
indeed
properly
observes
that
pride
was
the
first
of
all
evils
because
if
ambition
had
not
elated
man
beyond
what
was
lawful
and
right
he
might
have
continued
in
his
honourable
situation
but
we
may
obtain
a
more
complete
definition
from
the
nature
of
the
temptation
as
described
by
moses
for
as
the
woman
by
the
subtlety
of
the
serpent
was
seduced
to
discredit
the
word
of
god
it
is
evident
that
the
fall
commenced
in
disobedience
this
is
also
confirmed
by
paul
who
states
that
all
men
were
ruined
by
the
disobedience
of
one
but
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
when
the
first
man
rebelled
against
the
government
of
god
he
not
only
was
ensnared
by
the
allurements
of
satan
but
despised
the
truth
and
turned
aside
to
falsehood
and
there
certainly
can
be
no
reverence
of
god
left
where
his
word
is
contemned
for
we
preserve
a
sense
of
his
majesty
and
the
purity
of
his
worship
no
longer
than
we
implicitly
attend
to
his
voice
infidelity
therefore
was
the
root
of
that
defection
but
hence
sprang
ambition
pride
and
ingratitude
since
adam
by
coveting
more
than
was
granted
offered
an
indignity
to
the
divine
goodness
which
had
so
greatly
enriched
him
now
it
was
monstrous
impiety
that
a
son
of
the
earth
should
not
be
satisfied
with
being
made
after
the
similitude
of
god
unless
he
could
also
be
equal
to
him
if
apostasy
which
consists
in
revolting
from
the
government
of
the
creator
and
petulantly
rejecting
his
authority
be
a
base
and
execrable
crime
it
is
a
vain
attempt
to
extenuate
the
sin
of
adam
though
the
transgression
of
our
first
parents
was
not
simple
apostasy
they
were
also
guilty
of
vile
reproaches
against
god
in
consenting
to
the
calumnies
of
satan
who
accused
god
of
falsehood
envy
and
malignity
finally
infidelity
opened
the
gate
to
ambition
and
ambition
produced
obstinacy
so
that
they
cast
off
the
fear
of
god
and
precipitated
themselves
whithersoever
they
were
led
by
their
lawless
desires
with
propriety
therefore
bernard
teaches
that
the
gate
of
salvation
is
opened
to
us
when
in
the
present
day
we
receive
the
gospel
with
our
ears
as
death
was
once
admitted
at
the
same
doors
when
they
lay
open
to
satan
for
adam
had
never
dared
to
resist
the
authority
of
god
if
he
had
not
discredited
his
word
this
was
certainly
the
best
check
for
a
due
regulation
of
all
the
affections
that
the
chief
good
consists
in
the
practice
of
righteousness
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
god
and
that
the
ultimate
end
of
a
happy
life
is
to
be
beloved
by
him
being
seduced
therefore
by
the
blasphemies
of
the
devil
he
did
all
that
was
in
his
power
towards
a
total
annihilation
of
the
glory
of
god
as
the
spiritual
life
of
adam
consisted
in
a
union
to
his
maker
so
an
alienation
from
him
was
the
death
of
his
soul
nor
is
it
surprising
that
he
ruined
his
posterity
by
his
defection
which
has
perverted
the
whole
order
of
nature
in
heaven
and
earth
the
creatures
groan
says
paul
being
made
subject
to
vanity
not
if
the
cause
be
inquired
it
is
undoubtedly
that
they
sustain
part
of
the
punishment
due
to
the
demerits
of
man
for
whose
use
they
were
created
and
his
guilt
being
the
origin
of
that
curse
which
extends
to
every
part
of
the
world
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
its
propagation
to
all
his
offspring
therefore
when
the
divine
image
in
him
was
obliterated
and
he
was
punished
with
the
loss
of
wisdom
strength
sanctity
truth
and
righteousness
with
which
he
had
been
adorned
but
which
were
succeeded
by
the
dreadful
pests
of
ignorance
impotence
impurity
vanity
and
iniquity
he
suffered
not
alone
but
involved
all
his
posterity
with
him
and
plunged
them
into
the
same
miseries
this
is
that
hereditary
corruption
which
the
fathers
called
meaning
by
sin
the
depravation
of
a
nature
previously
good
and
pure
on
which
subject
they
had
much
contention
nothing
being
more
remote
from
natural
reason
than
that
all
should
be
criminated
on
account
of
the
guilt
of
one
and
thus
his
sin
become
common
which
seems
to
have
been
the
reason
why
the
most
ancient
doctors
of
the
church
did
but
obscurely
glance
at
this
point
or
at
least
explained
it
with
less
perspicuity
than
it
required
yet
this
timidity
could
not
prevent
pelagius
from
arising
who
profanely
pretended
that
the
sin
of
adam
only
ruined
himself
and
did
not
injure
his
descendants
by
concealing
the
disease
with
this
delusion
satan
attempted
to
render
it
incurable
but
when
it
was
evinced
by
the
plain
testimony
of
the
scripture
that
sin
was
communicated
from
the
first
man
to
all
his
posterity
he
sophistically
urged
that
it
was
communicated
by
imitation
not
by
propagation
therefore
good
men
and
beyond
all
others
augustine
have
laboured
to
demonstrate
that
we
are
not
corrupted
by
any
adventitious
means
but
that
we
derive
an
innate
depravity
from
our
very
birth
the
denial
of
this
was
an
instance
of
consummate
impudence
but
the
temerity
of
the
pelagians
and
celestians
will
not
appear
surprising
to
him
who
perceives
from
the
writings
of
augustine
what
a
want
of
modesty
they
discover
in
every
thing
else
there
is
certainly
no
ambiguity
in
the
confession
of
david
that
he
was
shapen
in
iniquity
and
in
sin
his
mother
conceived
him
he
is
not
there
exposing
the
sins
of
his
mother
or
of
his
father
but
to
enhance
his
commendations
of
the
divine
goodness
towards
him
he
commences
the
confession
of
his
depravity
from
the
time
of
his
conception
as
it
is
evident
that
this
was
not
peculiar
to
david
it
is
fairly
concluded
that
his
case
exemplifies
the
common
condition
of
mankind
every
descendant
therefore
from
the
impure
source
is
born
infected
with
the
contagion
of
sin
and
even
before
we
behold
the
light
of
life
we
are
in
the
sight
of
god
defiled
and
polluted
for
who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean
the
book
of
job
tells
us
not
vi
we
have
heard
that
the
impurity
of
the
parents
is
so
transmitted
to
the
children
that
all
without
a
single
exception
are
polluted
as
soon
as
they
exist
but
we
shall
not
find
the
origin
of
this
pollution
unless
we
ascend
to
the
first
parent
of
us
all
as
to
the
fountain
which
sends
forth
all
the
streams
thus
it
is
certain
that
adam
was
not
only
the
progenitor
but
as
it
were
the
root
of
mankind
and
therefore
that
all
the
race
were
necessarily
vitiated
in
his
corruption
the
apostle
explains
this
by
a
comparison
between
him
and
christ
as
says
he
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
by
sin
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men
for
that
all
have
sinned
so
by
the
grace
of
christ
righteousness
and
life
have
been
restored
to
us
what
cavil
will
the
pelagians
raise
here
that
the
sin
of
adam
was
propagated
by
imitation
do
we
then
receive
no
other
advantage
from
the
righteousness
of
christ
than
the
proposal
of
an
example
for
our
imitation
who
can
bear
such
blasphemy
but
if
it
can
not
be
controverted
that
the
righteousness
of
christ
is
ours
by
communication
and
life
as
its
consequence
it
is
equally
evident
that
both
were
lost
in
adam
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they
were
recovered
in
christ
and
that
sin
and
death
were
introduced
by
adam
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they
are
abolished
by
christ
there
is
no
obscurity
in
the
declaration
that
many
are
made
righteous
by
the
obedience
of
christ
as
they
had
been
made
sinners
by
the
disobedience
of
adam
and
therefore
between
these
two
persons
there
is
this
relation
that
the
one
ruined
us
by
involving
us
in
his
destruction
the
other
by
his
grace
has
restored
us
to
salvation
any
more
prolix
or
tedious
proof
of
a
truth
supported
by
such
clear
evidence
must
i
think
be
unnecessary
thus
also
in
the
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
with
a
view
to
confirm
the
pious
in
a
confidence
of
the
resurrection
he
shows
that
the
life
which
had
been
lost
in
adam
was
recovered
in
christ
he
who
pronounces
that
we
were
all
dead
in
adam
does
also
at
the
same
time
plainly
declare
that
we
were
implicated
in
the
guilt
of
his
sin
for
no
condemnation
could
reach
those
who
were
perfectly
clear
from
all
charge
of
iniquity
but
his
meaning
can
not
be
better
understood
than
from
the
relation
of
the
other
member
of
the
sentence
where
he
informs
us
that
the
hope
of
life
is
restored
in
christ
but
that
is
well
known
to
be
accomplished
only
when
christ
by
a
wonderful
communication
transfuses
into
us
the
virtue
of
his
righteousness
as
it
is
elsewhere
said
the
spirit
is
life
because
of
no
other
explanation
therefore
can
be
given
of
our
being
said
to
be
dead
in
adam
than
that
his
transgression
not
only
procured
misery
and
ruin
for
himself
but
also
precipitated
our
nature
into
similar
destruction
and
that
not
by
his
personal
guilt
as
an
individual
which
pertains
not
to
us
but
because
he
infected
all
his
descendants
with
the
corruption
into
which
he
had
fallen
otherwise
there
would
be
no
truth
in
the
assertion
of
paul
that
all
are
by
nature
children
of
wrath
if
they
had
not
been
already
under
the
curse
even
before
their
birth
now
it
is
easily
inferred
that
our
nature
is
there
characterized
not
as
it
was
created
by
god
but
as
it
was
vitiated
in
adam
because
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
make
god
the
author
of
death
adam
therefore
corrupted
himself
in
such
a
manner
that
the
contagion
has
been
communicated
from
him
to
all
his
offspring
and
christ
himself
the
heavenly
judge
declares
in
the
most
unequivocal
terms
that
all
are
born
in
a
state
of
pravity
and
corruption
when
he
teaches
that
whatsoever
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
and
that
therefore
the
gate
of
life
is
closed
against
all
who
have
not
been
regenerated
vii
nor
to
enable
us
to
understand
this
subject
have
we
any
need
to
enter
on
that
tedious
dispute
with
which
the
fathers
were
not
a
little
perplexed
whether
the
soul
of
a
son
proceeds
by
derivation
or
transmission
from
the
soul
of
the
father
because
the
soul
is
the
principal
seat
of
the
pollution
we
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
this
that
the
lord
deposited
with
adam
the
endowments
he
chose
to
confer
on
the
human
nature
and
therefore
that
when
he
lost
the
favours
he
had
received
he
lost
them
not
only
for
himself
but
for
us
all
who
will
be
solicitous
about
a
transmission
of
the
soul
when
he
hears
that
adam
received
the
ornaments
that
he
lost
no
less
for
us
than
for
himself
that
they
were
given
not
to
one
man
only
but
to
the
whole
human
nature
there
is
nothing
absurd
therefore
if
in
consequence
of
his
being
spoiled
of
his
dignities
that
nature
be
destitute
and
poor
if
in
consequence
of
his
being
polluted
with
sin
the
whole
nature
be
infected
with
the
contagion
from
a
putrefied
root
therefore
have
sprung
putrid
branches
which
have
transmitted
their
putrescence
to
remoter
ramifications
for
the
children
were
so
vitiated
in
their
parent
that
they
became
contagious
to
their
descendants
there
was
in
adam
such
a
spring
of
corruption
that
it
is
transfused
from
parents
to
children
in
a
perpetual
stream
but
the
cause
of
the
contagion
is
not
in
the
substance
of
the
body
or
of
the
soul
but
because
it
was
ordained
by
god
that
the
gifts
which
he
conferred
on
the
first
man
should
by
him
be
preserved
or
lost
both
for
himself
and
for
all
his
posterity
but
the
cavil
of
the
pelagians
that
it
is
improbable
that
children
should
derive
corruption
from
pious
parents
whereas
they
ought
rather
to
be
sanctified
by
their
purity
is
easily
refuted
for
they
descend
from
their
carnal
generation
not
from
their
spiritual
generation
therefore
as
augustine
says
neither
the
guilty
unbeliever
nor
the
justified
believer
generates
innocent
but
guilty
children
because
the
generation
of
both
is
from
corrupted
if
they
in
some
measure
participate
of
the
sanctity
of
their
parents
that
is
the
peculiar
benediction
of
the
people
of
god
which
supersedes
not
the
first
and
universal
curse
previously
denounced
on
the
human
nature
for
their
guilt
is
from
nature
but
their
sanctification
from
supernatural
grace
viii
to
remove
all
uncertainty
and
misunderstanding
on
this
subject
let
us
define
original
sin
it
is
not
my
intention
to
discuss
all
the
definitions
given
by
writers
i
shall
only
produce
one
which
i
think
perfectly
consistent
with
the
truth
original
sin
therefore
appears
to
be
an
hereditary
pravity
and
corruption
of
our
nature
diffused
through
all
the
parts
of
the
soul
rendering
us
obnoxious
to
the
divine
wrath
and
producing
in
us
those
works
which
the
scripture
calls
works
of
the
and
this
is
indeed
what
paul
frequently
denominates
the
works
which
proceed
thence
such
as
adulteries
fornications
thefts
hatreds
murders
revellings
he
calls
in
the
same
manner
fruits
of
sin
although
they
are
also
called
sins
in
many
passages
of
scripture
and
even
by
himself
these
two
things
therefore
should
be
distinctly
observed
first
that
our
nature
being
so
totally
vitiated
and
depraved
we
are
on
account
of
this
very
corruption
considered
as
convicted
and
justly
condemned
in
the
sight
of
god
to
whom
nothing
is
acceptable
but
righteousness
innocence
and
purity
and
this
liableness
to
punishment
arises
not
from
the
delinquency
of
another
for
when
it
is
said
that
the
sin
of
adam
renders
us
obnoxious
to
the
divine
judgment
it
is
not
to
be
understood
as
if
we
though
innocent
were
undeservedly
loaded
with
the
guilt
of
his
sin
but
because
we
are
all
subject
to
a
curse
in
consequence
of
his
transgression
he
is
therefore
said
to
have
involved
us
in
guilt
nevertheless
we
derive
from
him
not
only
the
punishment
but
also
the
pollution
to
which
the
punishment
is
justly
due
wherefore
augustine
though
he
frequently
calls
it
the
sin
of
another
the
more
clearly
to
indicate
its
transmission
to
us
by
propagation
yet
at
the
same
time
also
asserts
it
properly
to
belong
to
every
individual
and
the
apostle
himself
expressly
declares
that
death
has
therefore
passed
upon
all
men
for
that
all
have
sinned
that
is
have
been
involved
in
original
sin
and
defiled
with
its
blemishes
and
therefore
infants
themselves
as
they
bring
their
condemnation
into
the
world
with
them
are
rendered
obnoxious
to
punishment
by
their
own
sinfulness
not
by
the
sinfulness
of
another
for
though
they
have
not
yet
produced
the
fruits
of
their
iniquity
yet
they
have
the
seed
of
it
within
them
even
their
whole
nature
is
as
it
were
a
seed
of
sin
and
therefore
can
not
but
be
odious
and
abominable
to
god
whence
it
follows
that
it
is
properly
accounted
sin
in
the
sight
of
god
because
there
could
be
no
guilt
without
crime
the
other
thing
to
be
remarked
is
that
this
depravity
never
ceases
in
us
but
is
perpetually
producing
new
fruits
those
works
of
the
flesh
which
we
have
before
described
like
the
emission
of
flame
and
sparks
from
a
heated
furnace
or
like
the
streams
of
water
from
a
never
failing
spring
wherefore
those
who
have
defined
original
sin
as
a
privation
of
the
original
righteousness
which
we
ought
to
possess
though
they
comprise
the
whole
of
the
subject
yet
have
not
used
language
sufficiently
expressive
of
its
operation
and
influence
for
our
nature
is
not
only
destitute
of
all
good
but
is
so
fertile
in
all
evils
that
it
can
not
remain
inactive
those
who
have
called
it
have
used
an
expression
not
improper
if
it
were
only
added
which
is
far
from
being
conceded
by
most
persons
that
every
thing
in
man
the
understanding
and
will
the
soul
and
body
is
polluted
and
engrossed
by
this
concupiscence
or
to
express
it
more
briefly
that
man
is
of
himself
nothing
else
but
concupiscence
ix
wherefore
i
have
asserted
that
sin
has
possessed
all
the
powers
of
the
soul
since
adam
departed
from
the
fountain
of
righteousness
for
man
has
not
only
been
ensnared
by
the
inferior
appetites
but
abominable
impiety
has
seized
the
very
citadel
of
his
mind
and
pride
has
penetrated
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
heart
so
that
it
is
weak
and
foolish
to
restrict
the
corruption
which
has
proceeded
thence
to
what
are
called
the
sensual
affections
or
to
call
it
an
incentive
which
allures
excites
and
attracts
to
sin
only
what
they
style
the
sensual
part
in
this
the
grossest
ignorance
has
been
discovered
by
peter
lombard
who
when
investigating
the
seat
of
it
says
that
it
is
in
the
flesh
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
not
indeed
exclusively
but
because
it
principally
appears
in
the
flesh
as
though
paul
designated
only
a
part
of
the
soul
and
not
the
whole
of
our
nature
which
is
opposed
to
supernatural
grace
now
paul
removes
every
doubt
by
informing
us
that
the
corruption
resides
not
in
one
part
only
but
that
there
is
nothing
pure
and
uncontaminated
by
its
mortal
infection
for
when
arguing
respecting
corrupt
nature
he
not
only
condemns
the
inordinate
motions
of
the
appetites
but
principally
insists
on
the
blindness
of
the
mind
and
the
depravity
of
the
heart
and
the
third
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
romans
is
nothing
but
a
description
of
original
sin
this
appears
more
evident
from
our
renovation
for
the
spirit
which
is
opposed
to
the
old
man
and
the
flesh
not
only
denotes
the
grace
which
corrects
the
inferior
or
sensual
part
of
the
soul
but
comprehends
a
complete
reformation
of
all
its
powers
and
therefore
paul
not
only
enjoins
us
to
mortify
our
sensual
appetites
but
exhorts
us
to
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
our
mind
and
in
another
place
he
directs
us
to
be
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
our
mind
whence
it
follows
that
that
part
which
principally
displays
the
excellence
and
dignity
of
the
soul
is
not
only
wounded
but
so
corrupted
that
it
requires
not
merely
to
be
healed
but
to
receive
a
new
nature
how
far
sin
occupies
both
the
mind
and
the
heart
we
shall
presently
see
my
intention
here
was
only
to
hint
in
a
brief
way
that
man
is
so
totally
overwhelmed
as
with
a
deluge
that
no
part
is
free
from
sin
and
therefore
that
whatever
proceeds
from
him
is
accounted
sin
as
paul
says
that
all
the
affections
or
thoughts
of
the
flesh
are
enmity
against
god
and
therefore
death
x
now
let
us
dismiss
those
who
dare
to
charge
god
with
their
corruptions
because
we
say
that
men
are
naturally
corrupt
they
err
in
seeking
for
the
work
of
god
in
their
own
pollution
whereas
they
should
rather
seek
it
in
the
nature
of
adam
while
yet
innocent
and
uncorrupted
our
perdition
therefore
proceeds
from
the
sinfulness
of
our
flesh
not
from
god
it
being
only
a
consequence
of
our
degenerating
from
our
primitive
condition
and
let
no
one
murmur
that
god
might
have
made
a
better
provision
for
our
safety
by
preventing
the
fall
of
adam
for
such
an
objection
ought
to
be
abominated
as
too
presumptuously
curious
by
all
pious
minds
and
it
also
belongs
to
the
mystery
of
predestination
which
shall
afterwards
be
treated
in
its
proper
place
wherefore
let
us
remember
that
our
ruin
must
be
imputed
to
the
corruption
of
our
nature
that
we
may
not
bring
an
accusation
against
god
himself
the
author
of
nature
that
this
fatal
wound
is
inherent
in
our
nature
is
indeed
a
truth
but
it
is
an
important
question
whether
it
was
in
it
originally
or
was
derived
from
any
extraneous
cause
but
it
is
evident
that
it
was
occasioned
by
sin
we
have
therefore
no
reason
to
complain
but
of
ourselves
which
in
the
scripture
is
distinctly
remarked
for
the
preacher
says
this
only
have
i
found
that
god
hath
made
man
upright
but
they
have
sought
out
many
it
is
clear
that
the
misery
of
man
must
be
ascribed
solely
to
himself
since
he
was
favoured
with
rectitude
by
the
divine
goodness
but
has
lapsed
into
vanity
through
his
own
folly
xi
we
say
therefore
that
man
is
corrupted
by
a
natural
depravity
but
which
did
not
originate
from
nature
we
deny
that
it
proceeded
from
nature
to
signify
that
it
is
rather
an
adventitious
quality
or
accident
than
a
substantial
property
originally
innate
yet
we
call
it
natural
that
no
one
may
suppose
it
to
be
contracted
by
every
individual
from
corrupt
habit
whereas
it
prevails
over
all
by
hereditary
right
nor
is
this
representation
of
ours
without
authority
for
the
same
reason
the
apostle
says
that
we
are
all
by
nature
the
children
of
wrath
how
could
god
who
is
pleased
with
all
his
meanest
works
be
angry
with
the
noblest
of
all
his
creatures
but
he
is
angry
rather
with
the
corruption
of
his
work
than
with
his
work
itself
therefore
if
on
account
of
the
corruption
of
human
nature
man
be
justly
said
to
be
naturally
abominable
to
god
he
may
also
be
truly
said
to
be
naturally
depraved
and
corrupt
as
augustine
in
consequence
of
the
corruption
of
nature
hesitates
not
to
call
those
sins
natural
which
necessarily
predominate
in
our
flesh
where
they
are
not
prevented
by
the
grace
of
god
thus
vanishes
the
foolish
and
nugatory
system
of
the
manichæans
who
having
imagined
in
man
a
substantial
wickedness
presumed
to
invent
for
him
a
new
creator
that
they
might
not
appear
to
assign
the
cause
and
origin
of
evil
to
a
righteous
god
chapter
ii
man
in
his
present
state
despoiled
of
freedom
of
will
and
subjected
to
a
miserable
slavery
since
we
have
seen
that
the
domination
of
sin
from
the
time
of
its
subjugation
of
the
first
man
not
only
extends
over
the
whole
race
but
also
exclusively
possesses
every
soul
it
now
remains
to
be
more
closely
investigated
whether
we
are
despoiled
of
all
freedom
and
if
any
particle
of
it
yet
remain
how
far
its
power
extends
but
that
we
may
the
more
easily
discover
the
truth
of
this
question
i
will
first
set
up
by
the
way
a
mark
by
which
our
whole
course
must
be
regulated
the
best
method
of
guarding
against
error
is
to
consider
the
dangers
which
threaten
us
on
every
side
for
when
man
is
declared
to
be
destitute
of
all
rectitude
he
immediately
makes
it
an
occasion
of
slothfulness
and
because
he
is
said
to
have
no
power
of
himself
for
the
pursuit
of
righteousness
he
totally
neglects
it
as
though
it
did
not
at
all
concern
him
on
the
other
hand
he
can
not
arrogate
any
thing
to
himself
be
it
ever
so
little
without
god
being
robbed
of
his
honour
and
himself
being
endangered
by
presumptuous
temerity
therefore
to
avoid
striking
on
either
of
these
rocks
this
will
be
the
course
to
be
man
being
taught
that
he
has
nothing
good
left
in
his
possession
and
being
surrounded
on
every
side
with
the
most
miserable
necessity
should
nevertheless
be
instructed
to
aspire
to
the
good
of
which
he
is
destitute
and
to
the
liberty
of
which
he
is
deprived
and
should
be
roused
from
indolence
with
more
earnestness
than
if
he
were
supposed
to
be
possessed
of
the
greatest
strength
the
necessity
of
the
latter
is
obvious
to
every
one
the
former
i
perceive
is
doubted
by
more
than
it
ought
to
be
for
this
being
placed
beyond
all
controversy
that
man
must
not
be
deprived
of
any
thing
that
properly
belongs
to
him
it
ought
also
to
be
manifest
how
important
it
is
that
he
should
be
prevented
from
false
boasting
for
if
he
was
not
even
then
permitted
to
glory
in
himself
when
by
the
divine
beneficence
he
was
decorated
with
the
noblest
ornaments
how
much
ought
he
now
to
be
humbled
when
on
account
of
his
ingratitude
he
has
been
hurled
from
the
summit
of
glory
to
the
abyss
of
ignominy
at
that
time
i
say
when
he
was
exalted
to
the
most
honourable
eminence
the
scripture
attributes
nothing
to
him
but
that
he
was
created
after
the
image
of
god
which
certainly
implies
that
his
happiness
consisted
not
in
any
goodness
of
his
own
but
in
a
participation
of
god
what
then
remains
for
him
now
deprived
of
all
glory
but
that
he
acknowledge
god
to
whose
beneficence
he
could
not
be
thankful
when
he
abounded
in
the
riches
of
his
favour
and
that
he
now
at
least
by
a
confession
of
his
poverty
glorify
him
whom
he
glorified
not
by
an
acknowledgment
of
his
blessings
it
is
also
no
less
conducive
to
our
interests
than
to
the
divine
glory
that
all
the
praise
of
wisdom
and
strength
be
taken
away
from
us
so
that
they
join
sacrilege
to
our
fall
who
ascribe
to
us
any
thing
more
than
truly
belongs
to
us
for
what
else
is
the
consequence
when
we
are
taught
to
contend
in
our
own
strength
but
that
we
are
lifted
into
the
air
on
a
reed
which
being
soon
broken
we
fall
to
the
ground
though
our
strength
is
placed
in
too
favourable
a
point
of
view
when
it
is
compared
to
a
reed
for
it
is
nothing
but
smoke
whatever
vain
men
have
imagined
and
pretend
concerning
it
wherefore
it
is
not
without
reason
that
that
remarkable
sentence
is
so
frequently
repeated
by
augustine
that
free
will
is
rather
overthrown
than
established
even
by
its
own
advocates
it
was
necessary
to
premise
these
things
for
the
sake
of
some
who
when
they
hear
that
human
power
is
completely
subverted
in
order
that
the
power
of
god
may
be
established
in
man
inveterately
hate
this
whole
argument
as
dangerous
and
unprofitable
which
yet
appears
to
be
highly
useful
to
us
and
essential
to
true
religion
ii
as
we
have
just
before
said
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
consist
in
the
mind
and
the
heart
let
us
now
consider
the
ability
of
each
the
philosophers
indeed
with
general
consent
pretend
that
in
the
mind
presides
reason
which
like
a
lamp
illuminates
with
its
counsels
and
like
a
queen
governs
the
will
for
that
it
is
so
irradiated
with
divine
light
as
to
be
able
to
give
the
best
counsels
and
endued
with
such
vigour
as
to
be
qualified
to
govern
in
the
most
excellent
manner
that
sense
on
the
contrary
is
torpid
and
afflicted
with
weakness
of
sight
so
that
it
always
creeps
on
the
ground
and
is
absorbed
in
the
grossest
objects
nor
ever
elevates
itself
to
a
view
of
the
truth
that
appetite
if
it
can
submit
to
the
obedience
of
reason
and
resist
the
attractions
of
sense
is
inclined
to
the
practice
of
virtues
travels
the
path
of
rectitude
and
is
formed
into
will
but
that
if
it
be
devoted
to
the
servitude
of
sense
it
is
thereby
so
corrupted
and
depraved
as
to
degenerate
into
lust
and
as
according
to
their
opinion
there
reside
in
the
soul
those
faculties
which
i
have
before
mentioned
understanding
sense
and
appetite
or
will
appellation
is
now
more
commonly
used
assert
that
the
understanding
is
endued
with
reason
that
most
excellent
guide
to
a
good
and
a
happy
life
provided
it
only
maintains
itself
in
its
own
excellence
and
exerts
its
innate
power
but
that
the
inferior
affection
of
the
soul
which
is
called
and
by
which
it
is
seduced
into
error
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
may
be
tamed
and
gradually
conquered
by
the
rod
of
reason
they
place
the
will
in
the
middle
station
between
reason
and
sense
as
perfectly
at
liberty
whether
it
chooses
to
obey
reason
or
to
submit
to
the
violence
of
sense
iii
sometimes
indeed
being
convinced
by
the
testimony
of
experience
they
admit
how
extremely
difficult
it
is
for
a
man
to
establish
within
him
the
kingdom
of
reason
while
he
is
exposed
at
one
time
to
the
solicitations
of
alluring
pleasures
at
another
to
the
delusions
of
pretended
blessings
and
at
others
to
the
violent
agitations
of
immoderate
passions
compared
by
plato
to
so
many
cords
dragging
him
in
various
directions
for
which
reason
cicero
says
that
the
sparks
kindled
by
nature
are
soon
extinguished
by
corrupt
opinions
and
evil
manners
but
when
such
maladies
have
once
taken
possession
of
the
human
mind
they
acknowledge
their
progress
to
be
too
violent
to
be
easily
restrained
nor
do
they
hesitate
to
compare
them
to
fierce
horses
who
having
rejected
reason
like
horses
that
have
thrown
off
the
charioteer
indulge
themselves
in
every
extravagance
without
the
least
restraint
but
they
consider
it
as
beyond
all
controversy
that
virtue
and
vice
are
in
our
own
power
for
if
it
be
at
our
election
they
say
to
do
this
or
that
therefore
it
must
also
be
to
abstain
from
doing
it
and
on
the
other
hand
if
we
are
free
to
abstain
from
it
we
must
also
be
free
to
do
it
but
we
appear
freely
and
voluntarily
to
do
those
things
which
we
do
and
to
abstain
from
those
things
from
which
we
abstain
therefore
if
we
do
any
good
action
when
we
please
we
may
omit
it
if
we
perpetrate
any
evil
that
also
we
may
avoid
moreover
some
of
them
have
advanced
to
such
a
degree
of
presumption
as
to
boast
that
we
are
indebted
to
the
gods
for
our
life
but
for
a
virtuous
and
religious
one
to
ourselves
whence
also
that
assertion
of
cicero
in
the
person
of
cotta
that
since
every
man
acquires
virtue
for
himself
none
of
the
wise
men
have
ever
thanked
god
for
it
for
says
he
we
are
praised
for
virtue
and
in
virtue
we
glory
which
would
not
be
the
case
if
it
were
a
gift
of
god
and
did
not
originate
from
and
a
little
after
this
is
the
judgment
of
all
men
that
fortune
must
be
asked
of
god
but
that
wisdom
must
be
derived
from
this
then
is
the
substance
of
the
opinion
of
all
the
philosophers
that
the
reason
of
the
human
understanding
is
sufficient
for
its
proper
government
that
the
will
being
subject
to
it
is
indeed
solicited
by
sense
to
evil
objects
but
as
it
has
a
free
choice
there
can
be
no
impediment
to
its
following
reason
as
its
guide
in
all
things
iv
among
the
ecclesiastical
writers
though
there
has
not
been
one
who
would
not
acknowledge
both
that
human
reason
is
grievously
wounded
by
sin
and
that
the
will
is
very
much
embarrassed
by
corrupt
affections
yet
many
of
them
have
followed
the
philosophers
far
beyond
what
is
right
the
early
fathers
appear
to
me
to
have
thus
extolled
human
power
from
a
fear
lest
if
they
openly
confessed
its
impotence
they
might
in
the
first
place
incur
the
derision
of
the
philosophers
with
whom
they
were
then
contending
and
in
the
next
place
might
administer
to
the
flesh
of
itself
naturally
too
torpid
to
all
that
is
good
a
fresh
occasion
of
slothfulness
to
avoid
delivering
any
principle
deemed
absurd
in
the
common
opinion
of
mankind
they
made
it
their
study
therefore
to
compromise
between
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
and
the
dogmas
of
the
philosophers
yet
it
appears
from
their
language
that
they
principally
regarded
the
latter
consideration
that
they
might
leave
no
room
for
slothfulness
chrysostom
says
since
god
has
placed
good
and
evil
things
in
our
power
he
has
given
us
freedom
of
choice
and
he
constrains
not
the
unwilling
but
embraces
the
again
oftentimes
a
bad
man
if
he
will
is
changed
into
a
good
one
and
a
good
one
falls
into
inactivity
and
becomes
bad
because
god
has
given
us
naturally
a
free
will
and
imposes
no
necessity
upon
us
but
having
provided
suitable
remedies
permits
the
event
to
depend
entirely
on
the
mind
of
the
again
as
without
the
assistance
of
divine
grace
we
can
never
do
any
thing
aright
so
unless
we
bring
what
is
our
own
we
shall
never
be
able
to
gain
the
favour
of
he
had
before
said
that
it
may
not
be
entirely
of
the
divine
assistance
it
behoves
us
also
to
bring
and
this
is
an
expression
very
familiar
with
him
let
us
bring
what
is
ours
god
will
supply
the
agreeably
to
which
jerome
says
that
it
belongs
to
us
to
begin
and
to
god
to
complete
that
it
is
ours
to
offer
what
we
can
but
his
to
supply
our
in
these
sentences
you
see
they
certainly
attributed
to
man
more
than
could
justly
be
attributed
to
him
towards
the
pursuit
of
virtue
because
they
supposed
it
impossible
to
awaken
our
innate
torpor
otherwise
than
by
arguing
that
this
alone
constitutes
our
guilt
but
with
what
great
dexterity
they
did
it
we
shall
see
in
the
course
of
our
work
that
the
passages
which
we
have
recited
are
exceedingly
erroneous
will
be
shortly
proved
although
the
greeks
beyond
all
others
and
among
them
particularly
chrysostom
have
exceeded
all
bounds
in
extolling
the
ability
of
the
human
will
yet
such
are
the
variations
fluctuations
or
obscurities
of
all
the
fathers
except
augustine
on
this
subject
that
scarcely
any
thing
certain
can
be
concluded
from
their
writings
therefore
we
shall
not
scrupulously
enumerate
the
particular
opinions
of
them
all
but
shall
at
times
select
from
one
and
another
so
much
as
the
explication
of
the
argument
shall
appear
to
require
succeeding
writers
being
every
one
for
himself
ambitious
of
the
praise
of
subtlety
in
the
defence
of
human
nature
gradually
and
successively
fell
into
opinions
more
and
more
erroneous
till
at
length
man
was
commonly
supposed
to
be
corrupted
only
in
his
sensual
part
but
to
have
his
will
in
a
great
measure
and
his
reason
entirely
unimpaired
in
the
mean
time
it
was
proclaimed
by
every
tongue
that
the
natural
talents
in
men
were
corrupted
but
the
supernatural
taken
expression
of
augustine
of
the
import
of
which
scarcely
one
man
in
a
hundred
had
the
slightest
idea
for
myself
if
i
meant
clearly
to
state
wherein
the
corruption
of
nature
consists
i
could
easily
content
myself
with
this
language
but
it
is
of
great
importance
to
examine
with
attention
what
ability
is
retained
by
man
in
his
present
state
corrupted
in
all
the
parts
of
his
nature
and
deprived
of
supernatural
gifts
this
subject
therefore
has
been
treated
in
too
philosophical
a
manner
by
those
who
gloried
in
being
the
disciples
of
christ
for
the
latins
have
always
retained
the
term
as
though
man
still
remained
in
his
primitive
integrity
and
the
greeks
have
not
been
ashamed
to
use
an
expression
much
more
arrogant
for
they
called
it
αυτεξουσιον
denoting
that
man
possesses
sovereign
power
over
himself
since
all
men
therefore
even
the
vulgar
are
tinctured
with
this
principle
that
man
is
endued
with
free
will
and
some
of
those
who
would
be
thought
intelligent
know
not
how
far
this
freedom
extends
us
first
examine
the
meaning
of
the
term
and
then
let
us
describe
according
to
the
simplicity
of
the
scripture
the
power
which
man
naturally
possesses
to
do
either
good
or
evil
what
is
though
the
expression
frequently
occurs
in
all
writers
few
have
defined
yet
origen
appears
to
have
advanced
a
position
to
which
they
all
assented
when
he
calls
it
a
power
of
to
discern
good
and
evil
of
to
choose
either
nor
does
augustine
differ
from
him
when
he
teaches
that
it
is
a
power
of
reason
and
will
by
which
good
is
chosen
when
grace
assists
and
evil
when
grace
is
wanting
bernard
while
he
affects
greater
subtlety
has
expressed
himself
with
more
obscurity
he
says
it
is
a
consent
on
account
of
the
liberty
of
will
which
can
not
be
lost
and
the
judgment
of
reason
which
can
not
be
avoided
the
definition
of
anselm
is
not
sufficiently
plain
who
states
it
to
be
a
power
of
preserving
rectitude
for
its
own
sake
therefore
peter
lombard
and
the
schoolmen
have
rather
adopted
the
definition
of
augustine
because
it
was
more
explicit
and
did
not
exclude
the
grace
of
god
without
which
they
perceived
that
the
will
had
no
power
of
itself
but
they
also
make
such
additions
of
their
own
as
they
conceived
to
be
either
better
or
conducive
to
further
explication
first
they
agree
that
the
word
or
should
rather
be
referred
to
reason
whose
office
it
is
to
discern
between
good
and
evil
and
that
the
epithet
belongs
properly
to
the
faculty
of
the
will
which
is
capable
of
being
inclined
to
either
wherefore
since
liberty
belongs
properly
to
the
will
thomas
aquinas
says
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
definition
if
free
will
were
called
elective
which
being
composed
of
understanding
and
appetite
inclines
rather
to
appetite
we
see
where
they
represent
the
power
of
free
will
to
be
placed
that
is
in
the
reason
and
will
it
now
remains
briefly
to
inquire
how
much
they
attribute
respectively
to
each
common
and
external
things
which
do
not
pertain
to
the
kingdom
of
god
they
generally
consider
as
subject
to
the
free
determination
of
man
but
true
righteousness
they
refer
to
the
special
grace
of
god
and
spiritual
regeneration
with
a
view
to
support
this
notion
the
author
of
the
treatise
on
the
vocation
of
the
gentiles
enumerates
three
kinds
of
first
a
sensitive
the
second
an
animal
and
the
third
a
spiritual
one
the
two
former
of
which
he
states
to
be
freely
exercised
by
us
and
the
last
to
be
the
work
of
the
holy
spirit
in
us
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
this
shall
be
discussed
in
the
proper
place
for
my
design
at
present
is
briefly
to
recite
the
opinions
of
others
not
to
refute
them
hence
when
writers
treat
of
free
will
their
first
inquiry
respects
not
its
ability
in
civil
or
external
actions
but
its
power
to
obey
the
divine
law
though
i
confess
the
latter
to
be
the
principal
question
yet
i
think
the
other
ought
not
to
be
wholly
neglected
and
for
this
opinion
i
hope
to
give
a
very
good
reason
but
a
distinction
has
prevailed
in
the
schools
which
enumerates
three
kinds
of
first
freedom
from
necessity
the
second
freedom
from
sin
the
third
freedom
from
misery
of
which
the
first
is
naturally
inherent
in
man
so
that
nothing
can
ever
deprive
him
of
it
the
other
two
are
lost
by
sin
this
distinction
i
readily
admit
except
that
it
improperly
confounds
necessity
with
coaction
and
the
wide
difference
between
these
things
with
the
necessity
of
its
being
considered
will
appear
in
another
place
vi
this
being
admitted
will
place
it
beyond
all
doubt
that
man
is
not
possessed
of
free
will
for
good
works
unless
he
be
assisted
by
grace
and
that
special
grace
which
is
bestowed
on
the
elect
alone
in
regeneration
for
i
stop
not
to
notice
those
fanatics
who
pretend
that
grace
is
offered
equally
and
promiscuously
to
all
but
it
does
not
yet
appear
whether
he
is
altogether
deprived
of
power
to
do
good
or
whether
he
yet
possesses
some
power
though
small
and
feeble
which
of
itself
can
do
nothing
but
by
the
assistance
of
grace
does
also
perform
its
part
lombard
in
order
to
establish
this
notion
informs
us
that
two
sorts
of
grace
are
necessary
to
qualify
us
for
the
performance
of
good
works
one
he
calls
operative
by
which
we
efficaciously
will
what
is
good
the
other
coöperative
which
attends
as
auxiliary
to
a
good
will
this
division
i
dislike
because
while
he
attributes
an
efficacious
desire
of
what
is
good
to
the
grace
of
god
he
insinuates
that
man
has
of
his
own
nature
antecedent
though
ineffectual
desires
after
what
is
good
as
bernard
asserts
that
a
good
will
is
the
work
of
god
but
yet
allows
that
man
is
to
desire
such
a
good
will
but
this
is
very
remote
from
the
meaning
of
augustine
from
whom
however
lombard
would
be
thought
to
have
borrowed
this
division
the
second
part
of
it
offends
me
by
its
ambiguity
which
has
produced
a
very
erroneous
interpretation
for
they
have
supposed
that
we
coöperate
with
the
second
sort
of
divine
grace
because
we
have
it
in
our
power
either
to
frustrate
the
first
sort
by
rejecting
it
or
to
confirm
it
by
our
obedience
to
it
the
author
of
the
treatise
on
the
vocation
of
the
gentiles
expresses
it
those
who
have
the
use
of
reason
and
judgment
are
at
liberty
to
depart
from
grace
that
they
may
be
rewarded
for
not
having
departed
and
that
what
is
impossible
without
the
coöperation
of
the
spirit
may
be
imputed
to
their
merits
by
whose
will
it
might
have
been
prevented
these
two
things
i
have
thought
proper
to
notice
as
i
proceed
that
the
reader
may
perceive
how
much
i
dissent
from
the
sounder
schoolmen
for
i
differ
considerably
more
from
the
later
sophists
as
they
have
departed
much
further
from
the
judgment
of
antiquity
however
we
understand
from
this
division
in
what
sense
they
have
ascribed
free
will
to
man
for
lombard
at
length
pronounces
that
we
are
not
therefore
possessed
of
free
will
because
we
have
an
equal
power
to
do
or
to
think
either
good
or
evil
but
only
because
we
are
free
from
constraint
and
this
liberty
is
not
diminished
although
we
are
corrupt
and
the
slaves
of
sin
and
capable
of
doing
nothing
but
sin
vii
then
man
will
be
said
to
possess
free
will
in
this
sense
not
that
he
has
an
equally
free
election
of
good
and
evil
but
because
he
does
evil
voluntarily
and
not
by
constraint
that
indeed
is
very
true
but
what
end
could
it
answer
to
decorate
a
thing
so
diminutive
with
a
title
so
superb
egregious
liberty
indeed
if
man
be
not
compelled
to
serve
sin
but
yet
is
such
a
willing
slave
that
his
will
is
held
in
bondage
by
the
fetters
of
sin
i
really
abominate
contentions
about
words
which
disturb
the
church
without
producing
any
good
effect
but
i
think
that
we
ought
religiously
to
avoid
words
which
signify
any
absurdity
particularly
when
they
lead
to
a
pernicious
error
how
few
are
there
pray
who
when
they
hear
free
will
attributed
to
man
do
not
immediately
conceive
that
he
has
the
sovereignty
over
his
own
mind
and
will
and
is
able
by
his
innate
power
to
incline
himself
to
whatever
he
pleases
but
it
will
be
said
all
danger
from
these
expressions
will
be
removed
if
the
people
are
carefully
apprized
of
their
signification
but
on
the
contrary
the
human
mind
is
naturally
so
prone
to
falsehood
that
it
will
sooner
imbibe
error
from
one
single
expression
than
truth
from
a
prolix
oration
of
which
we
have
a
more
certain
experiment
than
could
be
wished
in
this
very
word
for
neglecting
that
explanation
of
the
fathers
almost
all
their
successors
have
been
drawn
into
a
fatal
by
adhering
to
the
original
and
proper
signification
of
the
word
viii
but
if
we
regard
the
authority
of
the
they
have
the
term
continually
in
their
mouths
they
at
the
same
time
declare
with
what
extent
of
signification
they
use
it
first
of
all
augustine
who
hesitates
not
to
call
the
will
a
slave
he
expresses
his
displeasure
in
one
place
against
those
who
deny
free
will
but
he
declares
the
principal
reason
for
it
when
he
says
only
let
no
man
dare
so
to
deny
the
freedom
of
the
will
as
to
desire
to
excuse
elsewhere
he
plainly
confesses
that
the
human
will
is
not
free
without
the
spirit
since
it
is
subject
to
its
lusts
by
which
it
is
conquered
and
bound
again
that
when
the
will
was
overcome
by
the
sin
into
which
it
fell
nature
began
to
be
destitute
of
liberty
again
that
man
having
made
a
wrong
use
of
his
free
will
lost
both
it
and
himself
again
that
free
will
is
in
a
state
of
captivity
so
that
it
can
do
nothing
towards
righteousness
again
that
the
will
can
not
be
free
which
has
not
been
liberated
by
divine
grace
again
that
the
divine
justice
is
not
fulfilled
while
the
law
commands
and
man
acts
from
his
own
strength
but
when
the
spirit
assists
and
the
human
will
obeys
not
as
being
free
but
as
liberated
by
god
and
he
briefly
assigns
the
cause
of
all
this
when
in
another
place
he
tells
us
that
man
at
his
creation
received
great
strength
of
free
will
but
lost
it
by
sin
therefore
having
shown
that
free
will
is
the
result
of
grace
he
sharply
inveighs
against
those
who
arrogate
it
to
themselves
without
grace
how
then
says
he
do
miserable
men
dare
to
be
proud
of
free
will
before
they
are
liberated
or
of
their
own
strength
if
they
have
been
liberated
nor
do
they
consider
that
the
term
signifies
liberty
but
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
there
is
if
therefore
they
are
the
slaves
of
sin
why
do
they
boast
of
free
will
for
of
whom
a
man
is
overcome
of
the
same
is
he
brought
in
but
if
they
have
been
liberated
why
do
they
boast
as
of
their
own
work
are
they
so
much
at
liberty
as
to
refuse
to
be
the
servants
of
him
who
says
without
me
ye
can
do
nothing
besides
in
another
place
also
he
seems
to
discountenance
the
use
of
that
expression
when
he
says
that
the
will
is
free
but
not
liberated
free
from
righteousness
enslaved
to
sin
this
sentiment
he
also
repeats
and
applies
in
another
place
where
he
maintains
that
man
is
not
free
from
righteousness
but
by
the
choice
of
his
will
and
that
he
is
not
made
free
from
sin
but
by
the
grace
of
the
saviour
he
who
declares
that
human
liberty
is
nothing
but
an
emancipation
or
manumission
from
righteousness
evidently
exposes
it
to
ridicule
as
an
unmeaning
term
therefore
if
any
man
allows
himself
the
use
of
this
term
without
any
erroneous
signification
he
will
not
be
troubled
by
me
on
that
account
but
because
i
think
that
it
can
not
be
retained
without
great
danger
and
that
on
the
contrary
its
abolition
would
be
very
beneficial
to
the
church
i
would
neither
use
it
myself
nor
wish
it
to
be
used
by
others
who
may
consult
my
opinion
ix
perhaps
i
may
be
thought
to
have
raised
a
great
prejudice
against
myself
by
confessing
that
all
the
ecclesiastical
writers
except
augustine
have
treated
this
subject
with
such
ambiguities
or
variations
that
nothing
certain
can
be
learned
from
their
writings
for
some
will
interpret
this
as
though
i
intended
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
of
giving
their
suffrages
because
their
opinions
are
all
adverse
to
mine
but
i
have
had
no
other
object
in
view
than
simply
and
faithfully
to
consult
the
benefit
of
pious
minds
who
if
they
wait
to
discover
the
sentiments
of
the
fathers
on
this
subject
will
fluctuate
in
perpetual
uncertainty
at
one
time
they
teach
man
despoiled
of
all
strength
of
free
will
to
have
recourse
to
grace
alone
at
another
they
either
furnish
or
appear
to
furnish
him
with
armour
naturally
his
own
yet
that
amidst
all
this
ambiguity
of
expression
esteeming
the
strength
of
man
as
little
or
nothing
they
have
ascribed
the
praise
of
every
thing
that
is
good
entirely
to
the
holy
spirit
is
not
difficult
to
prove
if
i
introduce
some
passages
from
them
in
which
this
sentiment
is
clearly
maintained
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
assertion
of
cyprian
so
frequently
celebrated
by
augustine
that
we
ought
to
glory
in
nothing
because
we
have
nothing
of
our
own
but
that
man
completely
impoverished
in
himself
should
learn
to
depend
entirely
on
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
observation
of
augustine
and
eucherius
when
they
represent
christ
as
the
tree
of
life
to
whom
whosoever
shall
have
stretched
forth
his
hand
shall
live
and
free
will
as
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
say
that
whosoever
forsakes
the
grace
of
god
and
tastes
of
it
shall
die
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
assertion
of
chrysostom
that
every
man
by
nature
is
not
only
a
sinner
but
altogether
sin
if
we
have
not
one
good
quality
if
from
his
head
to
his
feet
man
be
entirely
sin
if
it
be
wrong
even
to
try
how
far
the
power
of
the
will
extends
then
can
it
be
right
to
divide
the
praise
of
a
good
work
between
god
and
man
i
could
introduce
many
such
passages
from
other
fathers
but
lest
any
one
should
cavil
that
i
select
only
those
things
which
favour
my
own
cause
but
artfully
omit
those
which
oppose
it
i
refrain
from
such
a
recital
i
venture
to
affirm
however
that
though
they
sometimes
too
highly
extol
free
will
yet
their
design
was
to
teach
man
to
discard
all
reliance
on
his
own
power
and
to
consider
all
his
strength
as
residing
in
god
alone
i
now
proceed
to
a
simple
explication
of
the
truth
in
considering
the
nature
of
man
x
but
i
am
obliged
to
repeat
here
what
i
premised
in
the
beginning
of
this
he
who
feels
the
most
consternation
from
a
consciousness
of
his
own
calamity
poverty
nakedness
and
ignominy
has
made
the
greatest
proficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
himself
for
there
is
no
danger
that
man
will
divest
himself
of
too
much
provided
he
learns
that
what
is
wanting
in
him
may
be
recovered
in
god
but
he
can
not
assume
to
himself
even
the
least
particle
beyond
his
just
right
without
ruining
himself
with
vain
confidence
and
incurring
the
guilt
of
enormous
sacrilege
by
transferring
to
himself
the
honour
which
belongs
to
god
and
whenever
our
minds
are
pestered
with
this
cupidity
to
desire
to
have
something
of
our
own
which
may
reside
in
ourselves
rather
than
in
god
we
may
know
that
this
idea
is
suggested
by
the
same
counsellor
who
excited
in
our
first
parents
the
desire
of
resembling
gods
knowing
good
and
if
that
term
be
diabolical
which
exalts
man
in
his
own
opinion
let
us
not
admit
it
unless
we
wish
to
take
the
counsel
of
an
enemy
it
is
pleasant
indeed
to
have
so
much
innate
strength
as
to
confide
in
and
be
satisfied
with
ourselves
but
from
being
allured
into
this
vain
confidence
let
us
be
deterred
by
the
many
awful
sentences
which
severely
humble
us
to
the
dust
such
as
cursed
be
the
man
that
trusteth
in
man
and
maketh
flesh
his
again
god
delighteth
not
in
the
strength
of
the
horse
he
taketh
not
pleasure
in
the
legs
of
a
man
the
lord
taketh
pleasure
in
them
that
fear
him
in
those
that
hope
in
his
again
he
giveth
power
to
the
faint
and
to
them
that
have
no
might
he
increaseth
strength
even
the
youths
shall
faint
and
be
weary
and
the
young
men
shall
utterly
fall
but
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
the
tendency
of
all
which
is
to
prevent
us
from
depending
in
the
smallest
degree
on
our
own
strength
if
we
wish
god
to
be
propitious
to
us
who
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
unto
the
then
let
us
remember
these
promises
i
will
pour
water
upon
him
that
is
thirsty
and
floods
upon
the
dry
ground
again
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
waters
which
declare
that
none
are
admitted
to
a
participation
of
the
blessings
of
god
but
those
who
are
pining
away
with
a
sense
of
their
own
poverty
nor
should
such
promises
as
this
of
isaiah
be
overlooked
the
sun
shall
be
no
more
thy
light
by
day
neither
for
brightness
shall
the
moon
give
light
unto
thee
but
the
lord
shall
be
unto
thee
an
everlasting
the
lord
certainly
does
not
deprive
his
servants
of
the
splendour
of
the
sun
or
of
the
moon
but
because
he
will
appear
exclusively
glorious
in
them
he
calls
off
their
confidence
to
a
great
distance
even
from
those
things
which
in
their
opinion
are
the
most
excellent
xi
i
have
always
indeed
been
exceedingly
pleased
with
this
observation
of
chrysostom
that
humility
is
the
foundation
of
our
philosophy
but
still
more
with
this
of
augustine
as
a
rhetorician
says
he
on
being
interrogated
what
was
the
first
thing
in
the
rules
of
eloquence
replied
pronunciation
and
on
being
separately
interrogated
what
was
the
second
and
what
was
the
third
gave
the
same
reply
so
should
any
one
interrogate
me
concerning
the
rules
of
the
christian
religion
the
first
second
and
third
i
would
always
reply
now
he
does
not
consider
it
as
humility
when
a
man
conscious
to
himself
of
some
little
power
abstains
from
pride
and
haughtiness
but
when
he
truly
feels
his
condition
to
be
such
that
he
has
no
refuge
but
in
humility
as
he
elsewhere
declares
let
no
man
says
he
flatter
himself
of
himself
he
is
a
devil
every
blessing
he
enjoys
is
only
from
god
for
what
have
you
that
is
your
own
but
sin
take
to
yourself
sin
which
is
your
own
for
righteousness
belongs
to
again
why
do
men
so
presume
on
the
ability
of
nature
it
is
wounded
maimed
distressed
and
ruined
it
needs
a
true
confession
not
a
false
again
when
every
one
knows
that
in
himself
he
is
nothing
and
that
he
can
not
assist
himself
the
arms
are
broken
within
him
and
the
contentions
are
but
it
is
necessary
that
all
the
weapons
of
impiety
should
be
broken
in
pieces
and
consumed
that
you
may
remain
unarmed
and
have
no
help
in
yourself
the
greater
your
weakness
is
in
yourself
so
much
the
more
the
lord
assists
you
so
in
the
seventieth
psalm
he
forbids
us
to
remember
our
own
righteousness
that
we
may
know
the
righteousness
of
god
and
shows
that
god
so
recommends
his
grace
to
us
that
we
may
know
that
we
are
nothing
and
are
solely
dependent
on
the
divine
mercy
being
of
ourselves
altogether
evil
here
then
let
us
not
contend
with
god
concerning
our
right
as
though
what
is
attributed
to
him
were
deducted
from
our
welfare
for
as
our
humility
is
his
exaltation
so
the
confession
of
our
humility
has
an
immediate
remedy
in
his
commiseration
now
i
do
not
expect
that
a
man
unconvinced
should
voluntarily
submit
and
if
he
has
any
strength
withdraw
his
attention
from
it
to
be
reduced
to
true
humility
but
i
require
that
discarding
the
malady
of
and
love
of
strife
which
blinds
him
and
leads
him
to
entertain
too
high
an
opinion
of
himself
he
should
seriously
contemplate
himself
in
the
faithful
mirror
of
the
scripture
xii
and
indeed
i
much
approve
of
that
common
observation
which
has
been
borrowed
from
augustine
that
the
natural
talents
in
man
have
been
corrupted
by
sin
but
that
of
the
supernatural
ones
he
has
been
wholly
deprived
for
by
the
latter
are
intended
both
the
light
of
faith
and
righteousness
which
would
be
sufficient
for
the
attainment
of
a
heavenly
life
and
eternal
felicity
therefore
when
he
revolted
from
the
divine
government
he
was
at
the
same
time
deprived
of
those
supernatural
endowments
which
had
been
given
him
for
the
hope
of
eternal
salvation
hence
it
follows
that
he
is
exiled
from
the
kingdom
of
god
in
such
a
manner
that
all
the
affections
relating
to
the
happy
life
of
the
soul
are
also
extinguished
in
him
till
he
recovers
them
by
the
grace
of
regeneration
such
are
faith
love
to
god
charity
towards
our
neighbours
and
an
attachment
to
holiness
and
righteousness
all
these
things
being
restored
by
christ
are
esteemed
adventitious
and
preternatural
and
therefore
we
conclude
that
they
had
been
lost
again
soundness
of
mind
and
rectitude
of
heart
were
also
destroyed
and
this
is
the
corruption
of
the
natural
talents
for
although
we
retain
some
portion
of
understanding
and
judgment
together
with
the
will
yet
we
can
not
say
that
our
mind
is
perfect
and
sound
which
is
oppressed
with
debility
and
immersed
in
profound
darkness
and
the
depravity
of
our
will
is
sufficiently
known
reason
therefore
by
which
man
distinguishes
between
good
and
evil
by
which
he
understands
and
judges
being
a
natural
talent
could
not
be
totally
destroyed
but
is
partly
debilitated
partly
vitiated
so
that
it
exhibits
nothing
but
deformity
and
ruin
in
this
sense
john
says
that
the
light
still
shineth
in
darkness
but
that
the
darkness
comprehendeth
it
in
this
passage
both
these
ideas
are
clearly
some
sparks
continue
to
shine
in
the
nature
of
man
even
in
its
corrupt
and
degenerate
state
which
prove
him
to
be
a
rational
creature
and
different
from
the
brutes
because
he
is
endued
with
understanding
and
yet
that
this
light
is
smothered
by
so
much
ignorance
that
it
can
not
act
with
any
degree
of
efficacy
so
the
will
being
inseparable
from
the
nature
of
man
is
not
annihilated
but
it
is
fettered
by
depraved
and
inordinate
desires
so
that
it
can
not
aspire
after
any
thing
that
is
good
this
indeed
is
a
complete
definition
but
requires
more
diffuse
explication
therefore
that
the
order
of
our
discourse
may
proceed
according
to
the
distinction
we
have
stated
in
which
we
divided
the
soul
into
understanding
and
will
let
us
first
examine
the
power
of
the
understanding
to
condemn
it
to
perpetual
blindness
so
as
to
leave
it
no
intelligence
in
any
thing
is
repugnant
not
only
to
the
divine
word
but
also
to
the
experience
of
common
sense
for
we
perceive
in
the
mind
of
man
some
desire
of
investigating
truth
towards
which
he
would
have
no
inclination
but
from
some
relish
of
it
previously
possessed
it
therefore
indicates
some
perspicuity
in
the
human
understanding
that
it
is
attracted
with
a
love
of
truth
the
neglect
of
which
in
the
brutes
argues
gross
sense
without
reason
although
this
desire
small
as
it
is
faints
even
before
its
entrance
on
its
course
because
it
immediately
terminates
in
vanity
for
the
dulness
of
the
human
mind
renders
it
incapable
of
pursuing
the
right
way
of
investigating
the
truth
it
wanders
through
a
variety
of
errors
and
groping
as
it
were
in
the
shades
of
darkness
often
stumbles
till
at
length
it
is
lost
in
its
wanderings
thus
in
its
search
after
truth
it
betrays
its
incapacity
to
seek
and
find
it
it
also
labours
under
another
grievous
malady
frequently
not
discerning
what
those
things
are
the
true
knowledge
of
which
it
would
be
proper
to
attain
and
therefore
torments
itself
with
a
ridiculous
curiosity
in
fruitless
and
unimportant
inquiries
to
things
most
necessary
to
be
known
it
either
never
adverts
or
contemptuously
and
rarely
digresses
but
scarcely
ever
studies
them
with
serious
application
this
depravity
being
a
common
subject
of
complaint
with
heathen
writers
all
men
are
clearly
proved
to
have
been
implicated
in
it
wherefore
solomon
in
his
ecclesiastes
after
having
enumerated
those
pursuits
in
which
men
consider
themselves
as
displaying
superior
wisdom
concludes
with
pronouncing
them
to
be
vain
and
frivolous
xiii
yet
its
attempts
are
not
always
so
fruitless
but
that
it
makes
some
discoveries
particularly
when
it
applies
itself
to
inferior
things
nor
is
it
so
stupid
as
to
be
without
some
slender
notion
also
of
superior
ones
however
negligently
it
attends
to
the
investigation
of
them
but
it
possesses
not
an
equal
ability
for
both
for
it
is
when
it
goes
beyond
the
limits
of
the
present
life
that
it
is
chiefly
convinced
of
its
own
imbecility
wherefore
that
we
may
better
perceive
how
far
it
proceeds
in
every
case
according
to
the
degrees
of
its
ability
it
will
be
useful
for
us
to
propose
the
following
distinction
that
there
is
one
understanding
for
terrestrial
things
and
another
for
celestial
ones
i
call
those
things
terrestrial
which
do
not
pertain
to
god
and
his
kingdom
to
true
righteousness
or
to
the
blessedness
of
a
future
life
but
which
relate
entirely
to
the
present
life
and
are
in
some
sense
confined
within
the
limits
of
it
celestial
things
are
the
pure
knowledge
of
god
the
method
of
true
righteousness
and
the
mysteries
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
in
the
first
class
are
included
civil
polity
domestic
economy
all
the
mechanical
arts
and
liberal
sciences
in
the
second
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
the
divine
will
and
the
rule
for
conformity
to
it
in
our
lives
now
in
regard
to
the
first
class
it
must
be
confessed
that
as
man
is
naturally
a
creature
inclined
to
society
he
has
also
by
nature
an
instinctive
propensity
to
cherish
and
preserve
that
society
and
therefore
we
perceive
in
the
minds
of
all
men
general
impressions
of
civil
probity
and
order
hence
it
is
that
not
a
person
can
be
found
who
does
not
understand
that
all
associations
of
men
ought
to
be
governed
by
laws
or
who
does
not
conceive
in
his
mind
the
principles
of
those
laws
hence
that
perpetual
consent
of
all
nations
as
well
as
all
individuals
to
the
laws
because
the
seeds
of
them
are
innate
in
all
mankind
without
any
instructor
or
legislator
i
regard
not
the
dissensions
and
contests
which
afterwards
arise
while
some
desire
to
invert
all
justice
and
propriety
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
the
laws
and
to
substitute
mere
cupidity
in
the
room
of
justice
as
is
the
case
with
thieves
and
robbers
is
a
fault
more
that
unjust
which
legislators
have
sanctioned
as
just
and
on
the
contrary
pronounce
that
to
be
laudable
which
they
have
forbidden
for
the
former
of
these
hate
not
the
laws
from
an
ignorance
that
they
are
good
and
sacred
but
inflamed
with
the
violence
of
their
passions
manifestly
contend
against
reason
and
under
the
influence
of
their
lawless
desires
execrate
that
which
their
judgments
approve
the
controversy
of
the
latter
of
these
is
by
no
means
repugnant
to
that
original
idea
of
equity
which
we
have
mentioned
for
when
men
dispute
with
each
other
on
the
comparative
merits
of
different
laws
it
implies
their
consent
to
some
general
rule
of
equity
this
clearly
argues
the
debility
of
the
human
mind
which
halts
and
staggers
even
when
it
appears
to
follow
the
right
way
yet
it
is
certainly
true
that
some
seeds
of
political
order
are
sown
in
the
minds
of
all
and
this
is
a
powerful
argument
that
in
the
constitution
of
this
life
no
man
is
destitute
of
the
light
of
reason
xiv
next
follow
the
arts
both
liberal
and
manual
for
learning
which
as
there
is
in
all
of
us
a
certain
aptitude
they
also
discover
the
strength
of
human
ingenuity
but
though
all
men
are
not
capable
of
learning
every
art
yet
it
is
a
very
sufficient
proof
of
the
common
energy
that
scarcely
an
individual
can
be
found
whose
sagacity
does
not
exert
itself
in
some
particular
art
nor
have
they
an
energy
and
facility
only
in
learning
but
also
in
inventing
something
new
in
every
art
or
in
amplifying
and
improving
what
they
have
learned
from
their
predecessors
though
this
excited
plato
erroneously
to
assert
that
such
an
apprehension
is
only
a
recollection
of
what
the
soul
knew
in
its
preëxistent
state
before
it
came
into
the
body
it
constrains
us
by
the
most
cogent
reasons
to
acknowledge
that
the
principle
of
it
is
innate
in
the
human
mind
these
instances
therefore
plainly
prove
that
men
are
endued
with
a
general
apprehension
of
reason
and
understanding
yet
it
is
such
a
universal
blessing
that
every
one
for
himself
ought
to
acknowledge
it
as
the
peculiar
favour
of
god
to
this
gratitude
the
author
of
nature
himself
abundantly
excites
us
by
his
creation
of
idiots
in
whom
he
represents
the
state
of
the
human
soul
without
his
illumination
which
though
natural
to
all
is
nevertheless
a
gratuitous
gift
of
his
beneficence
towards
every
individual
but
the
invention
and
methodical
teaching
of
these
arts
and
the
more
intimate
and
excellent
knowledge
of
them
which
is
peculiar
to
a
few
are
no
solid
argument
of
general
perspicacity
yet
belonging
to
both
the
pious
and
the
impious
they
are
justly
numbered
among
the
natural
talents
xv
whenever
therefore
we
meet
with
heathen
writers
let
us
learn
from
that
light
of
truth
which
is
admirably
displayed
in
their
works
that
the
human
mind
fallen
as
it
is
and
corrupted
from
its
integrity
is
yet
invested
and
adorned
by
god
with
excellent
talents
if
we
believe
that
the
spirit
of
god
is
the
only
fountain
of
truth
we
shall
neither
reject
nor
despise
the
truth
itself
wherever
it
shall
appear
unless
we
wish
to
insult
the
spirit
of
god
for
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
can
not
be
undervalued
without
offering
contempt
and
reproach
to
the
spirit
himself
now
shall
we
deny
the
light
of
truth
to
the
ancient
lawyers
who
have
delivered
such
just
principles
of
civil
order
and
polity
shall
we
say
that
the
philosophers
were
blind
in
their
exquisite
contemplation
and
in
their
scientific
description
of
nature
shall
we
say
that
those
who
by
the
art
of
logic
have
taught
us
to
speak
in
a
manner
consistent
with
reason
were
destitute
of
understanding
themselves
shall
we
accuse
those
of
insanity
who
by
the
study
of
medicine
have
been
exercising
their
industry
for
our
advantage
what
shall
we
say
of
all
the
mathematics
shall
we
esteem
them
the
delirious
ravings
of
madmen
on
the
contrary
we
shall
not
be
able
even
to
read
the
writings
of
the
ancients
on
these
subjects
without
great
admiration
we
shall
admire
them
because
we
shall
be
constrained
to
acknowledge
them
to
be
truly
excellent
and
shall
we
esteem
any
thing
laudable
or
excellent
which
we
do
not
recognize
as
proceeding
from
god
let
us
then
be
ashamed
of
such
great
ingratitude
which
was
not
to
be
charged
on
the
heathen
poets
who
confessed
that
philosophy
and
legislation
and
useful
arts
were
the
inventions
of
their
gods
therefore
since
it
appears
that
those
whom
the
scripture
styles
natural
men
ψυχικους
have
discovered
such
acuteness
and
perspicacity
in
the
investigation
of
sublunary
things
let
us
learn
from
such
examples
how
many
good
qualities
the
lord
has
left
to
the
nature
of
man
since
it
has
been
despoiled
of
what
is
truly
good
xvi
yet
let
us
not
forget
that
these
are
most
excellent
gifts
of
the
divine
spirit
which
for
the
common
benefit
of
mankind
he
dispenses
to
whomsoever
he
pleases
for
if
it
was
necessary
that
the
spirit
of
god
should
infuse
into
bezaleel
and
aholiab
the
understanding
and
skill
requisite
for
the
construction
of
the
tabernacle
we
need
not
wonder
if
the
knowledge
of
those
things
which
are
most
excellent
in
human
life
is
said
to
be
communicated
to
us
by
the
spirit
of
god
nor
is
there
any
reason
for
inquiring
what
intercourse
with
the
spirit
is
enjoyed
by
the
impious
who
are
entirely
alienated
from
god
for
when
the
spirit
of
god
is
said
to
dwell
only
in
the
faithful
that
is
to
be
understood
of
the
spirit
of
sanctification
by
whom
we
are
consecrated
as
temples
to
god
himself
yet
it
is
equally
by
the
energy
of
the
same
spirit
that
god
replenishes
actuates
and
quickens
all
creatures
and
that
according
to
the
property
of
each
species
which
he
has
given
it
by
the
law
of
creation
now
if
it
has
pleased
the
lord
that
we
should
be
assisted
in
physics
logic
mathematics
and
other
arts
and
sciences
by
the
labour
and
ministry
of
the
impious
let
us
make
use
of
them
lest
if
we
neglect
to
use
the
blessings
therein
freely
offered
to
us
by
god
we
suffer
the
just
punishment
of
our
negligence
but
lest
any
one
should
suppose
a
man
to
be
truly
happy
when
he
is
admitted
to
possess
such
powerful
energies
for
the
discovery
of
truth
relating
to
the
elements
of
this
world
it
must
likewise
be
added
that
all
that
faculty
of
understanding
and
the
understanding
which
is
the
consequence
of
it
is
in
the
sight
of
god
a
fleeting
and
transitory
thing
where
there
is
not
a
solid
foundation
of
truth
for
the
sentiment
of
augustine
with
whom
as
we
have
observed
the
master
of
the
sentences
and
the
schoolmen
have
been
constrained
to
coincide
is
strictly
as
the
gratuitous
or
supernatural
gifts
were
taken
away
from
man
after
the
fall
so
these
natural
ones
which
remained
have
been
corrupted
not
that
they
can
be
defiled
in
themselves
as
proceeding
from
god
but
because
they
have
ceased
to
be
pure
to
polluted
man
so
that
he
can
obtain
no
praise
from
them
xvii
let
us
conclude
therefore
that
it
is
evident
in
all
mankind
that
reason
is
a
peculiar
property
of
our
nature
which
distinguishes
us
from
the
brute
animals
as
sense
constitutes
the
difference
between
them
and
things
inanimate
for
whereas
some
are
born
fools
and
idiots
that
defect
obscures
not
the
general
goodness
of
god
such
a
spectacle
should
rather
teach
us
that
what
we
retain
ought
justly
to
be
ascribed
to
his
indulgence
because
had
it
not
been
for
his
mercy
to
us
our
defection
would
have
been
followed
by
the
total
destruction
of
our
nature
but
whereas
some
excel
in
penetration
others
possess
superior
judgment
and
others
have
a
greater
aptitude
to
learn
this
or
that
art
in
this
variety
god
displays
his
goodness
to
us
that
no
one
may
arrogate
to
himself
as
his
own
what
proceeds
merely
from
the
divine
liberality
for
whence
is
it
that
one
is
more
excellent
than
another
unless
it
be
to
exalt
in
our
common
nature
the
special
goodness
of
god
which
in
the
preterition
of
many
proclaims
that
it
is
under
an
obligation
to
none
moreover
god
inspires
particular
motions
according
to
the
vocation
of
each
individual
of
which
many
examples
occur
in
the
book
of
the
judges
where
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
said
to
come
upon
those
whom
he
called
to
govern
the
people
finally
in
all
important
actions
there
is
a
special
instinct
for
which
reason
it
is
said
that
saul
was
followed
by
valiant
men
whose
hearts
god
had
and
samuel
when
he
predicts
his
inauguration
into
the
kingdom
thus
expresses
himself
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
come
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
turned
into
another
and
this
is
extended
to
the
whole
course
of
his
government
as
it
is
afterwards
narrated
concerning
david
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
from
that
day
but
the
same
expression
is
used
in
other
places
in
reference
to
particular
impulses
even
in
homer
men
are
said
to
excel
in
abilities
not
only
as
jupiter
has
distributed
to
every
one
but
according
as
he
guides
him
from
day
to
day
and
experience
clearly
shows
since
the
most
ingenious
and
sagacious
of
mankind
frequently
stand
still
in
profound
astonishment
that
the
minds
of
men
are
subject
to
the
power
and
will
of
god
to
govern
them
every
moment
for
which
reason
it
is
said
that
he
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
people
of
the
earth
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no
yet
in
this
diversity
we
perceive
some
remaining
marks
of
the
divine
image
which
distinguish
the
human
race
in
general
from
all
the
other
creatures
xviii
we
now
proceed
to
show
what
human
reason
can
discover
when
it
comes
to
the
kingdom
of
god
and
to
that
spiritual
wisdom
which
consists
chiefly
in
three
know
god
his
paternal
favour
towards
us
on
which
depends
our
salvation
and
the
method
of
regulating
our
lives
according
to
the
rule
of
the
law
in
the
two
first
points
but
especially
in
the
second
the
most
sagacious
of
mankind
are
blinder
than
moles
i
do
not
deny
that
some
judicious
and
apposite
observations
concerning
god
may
be
found
scattered
in
the
writings
of
the
philosophers
but
they
always
betray
a
confused
imagination
the
lord
afforded
them
as
we
have
before
observed
some
slight
sense
of
his
divinity
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
plead
ignorance
as
an
excuse
for
impiety
and
sometimes
impelled
them
to
utter
things
by
the
confession
of
which
they
might
themselves
be
convinced
but
they
saw
the
objects
presented
to
their
view
in
such
a
manner
that
by
the
sight
they
were
not
even
directed
to
the
truth
much
less
did
they
arrive
at
it
just
as
a
man
who
is
travelling
by
night
across
a
field
sees
the
coruscations
of
lightning
extending
for
a
moment
far
and
wide
but
with
such
an
evanescent
view
that
so
far
from
being
assisted
by
them
in
proceeding
on
his
journey
he
is
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
before
he
can
advance
a
single
step
besides
those
few
truths
with
which
they
as
it
were
fortuitously
besprinkle
their
books
with
what
numerous
and
monstrous
falsehoods
are
they
defiled
lastly
they
never
had
the
smallest
idea
of
that
certainty
of
the
divine
benevolence
towards
us
without
which
the
human
understanding
must
necessarily
be
full
of
immense
confusion
human
reason
then
neither
approaches
nor
tends
nor
directs
its
views
towards
this
truth
to
understand
who
is
the
true
god
or
in
what
character
he
will
manifest
himself
to
us
xix
but
because
from
our
being
intoxicated
with
a
false
opinion
of
our
own
perspicacity
we
do
not
without
great
difficulty
suffer
ourselves
to
be
persuaded
that
in
divine
things
our
reason
is
totally
blind
and
stupid
it
will
be
better
i
think
to
confirm
it
by
testimonies
of
scripture
than
to
support
it
by
arguments
this
is
beautifully
taught
by
john
in
that
passage
which
i
lately
cited
where
he
says
that
from
the
beginning
in
god
was
life
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
and
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
he
indicates
indeed
that
the
soul
of
man
is
irradiated
with
a
beam
of
divine
light
so
that
it
is
never
wholly
destitute
either
of
some
little
flame
or
at
least
of
a
spark
of
it
but
he
likewise
suggests
that
it
can
not
comprehend
god
by
that
illumination
and
this
because
all
his
sagacity
as
far
as
respects
the
knowledge
of
god
is
mere
blindness
for
when
the
spirit
calls
men
darkness
he
at
once
totally
despoils
them
of
the
faculty
of
spiritual
understanding
wherefore
he
asserts
that
believers
who
receive
christ
are
born
not
of
blood
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
nor
of
the
will
of
man
but
of
god
as
though
he
had
said
that
the
flesh
is
not
capable
of
such
sublime
wisdom
as
to
conceive
of
god
and
divine
things
without
being
illuminated
by
the
spirit
of
god
as
christ
testified
that
his
being
known
by
peter
was
owing
to
a
special
revelation
of
the
father
xx
if
we
were
firmly
persuaded
of
what
indeed
ought
not
to
be
questioned
that
our
nature
is
destitute
of
all
those
things
which
our
heavenly
father
confers
on
his
elect
through
the
spirit
of
regeneration
here
would
be
no
cause
of
hesitation
for
this
is
the
language
of
the
faithful
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophet
with
thee
is
the
fountain
of
life
in
thy
light
we
shall
see
the
apostle
confirms
the
same
when
he
says
that
no
man
can
say
that
jesus
is
lord
but
by
the
holy
and
john
the
baptist
perceiving
the
stupidity
of
his
disciples
exclaims
that
a
man
can
receive
nothing
except
it
be
given
him
from
that
by
gift
he
intends
a
special
illumination
not
a
common
faculty
of
nature
is
evident
from
the
complaint
which
he
makes
of
the
inefficacy
of
the
many
discourses
in
which
he
had
recommended
christ
to
his
disciples
i
see
that
words
are
unavailing
to
instruct
the
minds
of
men
in
divine
things
unless
god
give
them
understanding
by
his
and
moses
also
when
he
reproaches
the
people
for
their
forgetfulness
yet
at
the
same
time
remarks
that
they
can
not
be
wise
in
the
mysteries
of
god
but
by
the
divine
favour
he
says
thine
eyes
have
seen
the
signs
and
those
great
miracles
yet
the
lord
hath
not
given
you
a
heart
to
perceive
and
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
what
more
would
he
express
if
he
had
called
them
blockheads
destitute
of
all
understanding
in
the
consideration
of
the
works
of
god
whence
the
lord
by
the
prophet
promises
as
an
instance
of
peculiar
grace
that
he
will
give
the
israelites
a
heart
to
know
him
plainly
suggesting
that
the
mind
of
man
has
no
spiritual
wisdom
any
further
than
as
it
is
enlightened
by
him
christ
also
has
clearly
confirmed
this
by
his
own
declaration
that
no
man
can
come
to
him
except
the
father
draw
him
what
is
he
not
himself
the
lively
image
of
the
father
representing
to
us
all
the
brightness
of
his
glory
therefore
he
could
not
better
manifest
the
extent
of
our
capacity
for
the
knowledge
of
god
than
when
he
affirms
that
we
have
no
eyes
to
behold
his
image
where
it
is
so
plainly
exhibited
what
did
he
not
descend
to
the
earth
in
order
to
discover
to
men
the
will
of
the
father
and
did
he
not
faithfully
fulfil
the
object
of
his
mission
he
certainly
did
but
his
preaching
is
not
at
all
efficacious
unless
the
way
to
the
heart
be
laid
open
by
the
internal
teaching
of
the
spirit
therefore
none
come
to
him
but
they
who
have
heard
and
learned
of
the
father
what
is
the
nature
of
this
hearing
and
learning
it
is
when
the
spirit
by
a
wonderful
and
peculiar
power
forms
the
ears
to
hear
and
the
mind
to
understand
and
lest
this
should
appear
strange
he
cites
the
prophecy
of
isaiah
where
predicting
the
restoration
of
the
church
he
says
that
all
those
who
shall
be
saved
shall
be
taught
of
the
if
god
there
predicts
something
peculiar
concerning
his
elect
it
is
evident
that
he
speaks
not
of
that
kind
of
instruction
which
is
common
also
to
the
impious
and
profane
it
must
be
concluded
therefore
that
there
is
no
admission
into
the
kingdom
of
god
but
for
him
whose
mind
has
been
renewed
by
the
illumination
of
the
holy
spirit
but
paul
expresses
himself
more
clearly
than
all
the
others
having
professedly
entered
upon
this
argument
after
he
has
condemned
all
human
wisdom
as
folly
and
vanity
and
even
reduced
it
to
nothing
he
comes
to
this
conclusion
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
neither
can
he
know
them
because
they
are
spiritually
whom
does
he
call
the
natural
man
him
who
depends
on
the
light
of
nature
he
i
say
has
no
apprehension
of
the
mysteries
of
god
why
so
because
through
slothfulness
he
neglects
them
nay
even
his
utmost
endeavours
can
avail
nothing
because
they
are
spiritually
this
implies
that
being
entirely
concealed
from
human
perspicacity
they
are
discovered
only
by
the
revelation
of
the
spirit
so
that
where
the
illumination
of
the
spirit
is
not
enjoyed
they
are
deemed
foolishness
itself
he
had
before
extolled
the
things
which
god
hath
prepared
for
them
that
love
him
above
the
capacity
of
our
eyes
our
ears
and
our
minds
he
had
even
asserted
that
human
wisdom
was
a
kind
of
veil
by
which
the
mind
is
prevented
from
a
discovery
of
god
what
do
we
want
more
the
apostle
pronounces
that
god
hath
made
foolish
the
wisdom
of
this
world
and
shall
we
ascribe
to
it
such
a
degree
of
sagacity
as
would
enable
it
to
penetrate
to
god
and
to
the
most
secret
recesses
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
far
be
from
us
such
extreme
stupidity
xxi
that
which
he
here
detracts
from
men
he
in
another
place
ascribes
exclusively
to
god
praying
for
the
ephesians
he
says
may
god
the
father
of
glory
give
unto
you
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
you
hear
now
that
all
wisdom
and
revelation
is
the
gift
of
god
what
follows
the
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
if
they
need
a
new
revelation
they
are
certainly
blind
of
themselves
it
follows
that
ye
may
know
what
is
the
hope
of
your
calling
he
confesses
then
that
the
minds
of
men
are
not
naturally
capable
of
so
great
knowledge
as
to
know
their
own
calling
nor
let
any
pelagian
here
object
that
god
assists
this
stupidity
or
ignorance
when
by
the
teaching
of
his
word
he
directs
the
human
understanding
to
that
which
without
a
guide
it
never
could
have
attained
for
david
had
the
law
in
which
all
desirable
wisdom
was
comprised
yet
not
content
with
this
he
requested
that
his
eyes
might
be
opened
to
consider
the
mysteries
of
that
law
by
this
expression
he
clearly
signifies
that
the
sun
arises
on
the
earth
where
the
word
of
god
shines
on
mankind
but
that
they
derive
little
advantage
from
it
till
he
himself
either
gives
them
eyes
or
opens
them
who
is
therefore
called
the
father
of
lights
because
wherever
he
shines
not
by
his
spirit
every
thing
is
covered
with
darkness
thus
also
the
apostles
were
rightly
and
abundantly
taught
by
the
best
of
all
teachers
yet
if
they
had
not
needed
the
spirit
of
truth
to
instruct
their
minds
in
that
very
doctrine
which
they
had
previously
heard
they
would
not
have
been
commanded
to
expect
him
if
in
imploring
any
favour
of
god
we
confess
our
need
and
if
his
promising
it
argues
our
poverty
let
no
man
hesitate
to
acknowledge
that
he
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
mysteries
of
god
any
further
than
he
has
been
illuminated
by
divine
grace
he
who
attributes
to
himself
more
understanding
is
so
much
the
blinder
because
he
does
not
perceive
and
acknowledge
his
blindness
xxii
it
remains
for
us
to
notice
the
third
branch
of
knowledge
relating
to
the
rule
for
the
proper
regulation
of
our
life
which
we
truly
denominate
the
knowledge
of
works
of
righteousness
in
which
the
human
mind
discovers
somewhat
more
acuteness
than
in
the
two
former
particulars
for
the
apostle
declares
that
when
the
gentiles
which
have
not
the
law
do
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law
these
having
not
the
law
are
a
law
unto
themselves
which
show
the
work
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts
their
conscience
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
if
the
gentiles
have
naturally
the
righteousness
of
the
law
engraven
on
their
minds
we
certainly
can
not
say
that
they
are
altogether
ignorant
how
they
ought
to
live
and
no
sentiment
is
more
commonly
admitted
than
that
man
is
sufficiently
instructed
in
a
right
rule
of
life
by
that
natural
law
of
which
the
apostle
there
speaks
but
let
us
examine
for
what
purpose
this
knowledge
of
the
law
was
given
to
men
and
then
it
will
appear
how
far
it
can
conduct
them
towards
the
mark
of
reason
and
truth
this
is
evident
also
from
the
words
of
paul
if
we
observe
the
connection
of
the
passage
he
had
just
before
said
as
many
as
have
sinned
without
law
shall
also
perish
without
law
and
as
many
as
have
sinned
in
the
law
shall
be
judged
by
the
because
it
might
appear
absurd
that
the
gentiles
should
perish
without
any
previous
knowledge
he
immediately
subjoins
that
their
conscience
supplies
the
place
of
a
law
to
them
and
is
therefore
sufficient
for
their
just
condemnation
the
end
of
the
law
of
nature
therefore
is
that
man
may
be
rendered
inexcusable
nor
will
it
be
improperly
defined
in
this
it
is
a
sentiment
of
the
conscience
sufficiently
discerning
between
good
and
evil
to
deprive
men
of
the
pretext
of
ignorance
while
they
are
convicted
even
by
their
own
testimony
such
is
the
indulgence
of
man
to
himself
that
in
the
perpetration
of
evil
actions
he
always
gladly
diverts
his
mind
as
much
as
he
possibly
can
from
all
sense
of
sin
which
seems
to
have
induced
plato
to
suppose
that
no
sin
is
committed
but
through
ignorance
this
remark
of
his
would
be
correct
if
the
hypocrisy
of
men
could
go
so
far
in
the
concealment
of
their
vices
as
that
the
mind
would
have
no
consciousness
of
its
guilt
before
god
but
since
the
sinner
though
he
endeavours
to
evade
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
imprinted
on
his
mind
is
frequently
brought
back
to
it
and
so
is
not
permitted
to
shut
his
eyes
but
compelled
whether
he
will
or
not
sometimes
to
open
them
there
is
no
truth
in
the
assertion
that
he
sins
only
through
ignorance
xxiii
themistius
another
philosopher
with
more
truth
teaches
that
the
human
understanding
is
very
rarely
deceived
in
the
universal
definition
or
in
the
essence
of
a
thing
but
that
it
falls
into
error
when
it
proceeds
further
and
descends
to
the
consideration
of
particular
cases
there
is
no
man
who
if
he
be
interrogated
in
a
general
way
will
not
affirm
homicide
to
be
criminal
but
he
who
conspires
the
death
of
his
enemy
deliberates
on
it
as
a
good
action
the
adulterer
will
condemn
adultery
in
general
but
will
privately
flatter
himself
in
his
own
here
lies
the
a
man
proceeding
to
a
particular
case
forgets
the
rule
which
he
had
just
fixed
as
a
general
position
this
subject
is
very
excellently
treated
by
augustine
in
his
exposition
of
the
first
verse
of
the
psalm
the
observation
of
themistius
however
is
not
applicable
to
all
cases
for
sometimes
the
turpitude
of
the
crime
so
oppresses
the
conscience
of
the
sinner
that
no
longer
imposing
on
himself
under
the
false
image
of
virtue
he
rushes
into
evil
with
the
knowledge
of
his
mind
and
the
consent
of
his
will
this
state
of
mind
produced
these
expressions
which
we
find
in
a
heathen
poet
i
see
the
better
path
and
approve
it
i
pursue
the
wherefore
the
distinction
of
aristotle
between
incontinence
and
intemperance
appears
to
me
to
be
highly
judicious
where
incontinence
predominates
he
says
that
by
the
perturbation
of
the
affections
or
passions
the
mind
is
deprived
of
particular
knowledge
so
that
in
its
own
evil
actions
it
observes
not
that
criminality
which
it
generally
discovers
in
similar
actions
committed
by
other
persons
and
that
when
the
perturbation
has
subsided
penitence
immediately
succeeds
that
intemperance
is
not
extinguished
or
broken
by
a
sense
of
sin
but
on
the
contrary
obstinately
persists
in
the
choice
of
evil
which
it
has
made
xxiv
now
when
you
hear
of
a
universal
judgment
in
man
to
discriminate
between
good
and
evil
you
must
not
imagine
that
it
is
every
where
sound
and
perfect
for
if
the
hearts
of
men
be
furnished
with
a
capacity
of
discriminating
what
is
just
and
unjust
only
that
they
may
not
excuse
themselves
with
the
plea
of
ignorance
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
them
to
discover
the
truth
in
every
point
it
is
quite
sufficient
if
they
understand
so
much
that
they
can
avail
themselves
of
no
subterfuge
but
being
convicted
by
the
testimony
of
their
own
conscience
even
now
begin
to
tremble
at
the
tribunal
of
god
and
if
we
will
examine
our
reason
by
the
divine
law
which
is
the
rule
of
perfect
righteousness
we
shall
find
in
how
many
respects
it
is
blind
it
certainly
is
far
from
reaching
the
principal
points
in
the
first
table
such
as
relate
to
trust
in
god
ascribing
to
him
the
praise
of
goodness
and
righteousness
the
invocation
of
his
name
and
the
true
observation
of
the
sabbath
what
mind
relying
on
its
natural
powers
ever
imagined
that
the
legitimate
worship
of
god
consisted
in
these
and
similar
things
for
when
profane
men
intend
to
worship
god
though
they
are
recalled
a
hundred
times
from
their
vain
and
nugatory
fancies
yet
they
are
always
relapsing
into
them
again
they
deny
that
sacrifices
are
pleasing
to
god
unaccompanied
with
sincerity
of
heart
thereby
testifying
that
they
have
some
ideas
concerning
the
spiritual
worship
of
god
which
nevertheless
they
immediately
corrupt
by
their
false
inventions
for
it
is
impossible
ever
to
persuade
them
that
every
thing
is
true
which
the
law
prescribes
concerning
it
shall
i
say
that
the
mind
of
man
excels
in
discernment
which
can
neither
understand
of
itself
nor
hearken
to
good
instructions
of
the
precepts
of
the
second
table
it
has
a
little
clearer
understanding
since
they
are
more
intimately
connected
with
the
preservation
of
civil
society
among
men
though
even
here
it
is
sometimes
found
to
be
deficient
for
to
every
noble
mind
it
appears
very
absurd
to
submit
to
an
unjust
and
imperious
despotism
if
it
be
possible
by
any
means
to
resist
it
a
uniform
decision
of
human
reason
is
that
it
is
the
mark
of
a
servile
and
abject
disposition
patiently
to
bear
it
and
of
an
honest
and
ingenuous
mind
to
shake
it
off
nor
is
the
revenging
of
injuries
esteemed
a
vice
among
the
philosophers
but
the
lord
condemning
such
excessive
haughtiness
of
mind
prescribes
to
his
people
that
patience
which
is
deemed
dishonourable
among
men
but
in
the
universal
observation
of
the
law
the
censure
of
concupiscence
wholly
escapes
our
notice
for
the
natural
man
can
not
be
brought
to
acknowledge
the
disorders
of
his
inward
affections
the
light
of
nature
is
smothered
before
it
approaches
the
first
entrance
of
this
abyss
for
when
the
philosophers
represent
the
inordinate
affections
of
the
mind
as
vices
they
intend
those
which
appear
and
manifest
themselves
in
the
grosser
external
actions
but
those
corrupt
desires
which
more
secretly
stimulate
the
mind
they
consider
as
nothing
xxv
wherefore
as
plato
has
before
been
deservedly
censured
for
imputing
all
sins
to
ignorance
so
also
we
must
reject
the
opinion
of
those
who
maintain
that
all
sins
proceed
from
deliberate
malice
and
pravity
for
we
too
much
experience
how
frequently
we
fall
into
error
even
when
our
intention
is
good
our
reason
is
overwhelmed
with
deceptions
in
so
many
forms
is
obnoxious
to
so
many
errors
stumbles
at
so
many
impediments
and
is
embarrassed
in
so
many
difficulties
that
it
is
very
far
from
being
a
certain
guide
paul
shows
its
deficiency
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
in
every
part
of
our
life
when
he
denies
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
think
any
thing
as
of
he
does
not
speak
of
the
will
or
of
the
affections
but
he
also
divests
us
of
every
good
thought
that
we
may
not
suppose
it
possible
for
our
minds
to
conceive
how
any
action
may
be
rightly
performed
are
all
our
industry
perspicacity
understanding
and
care
so
depraved
that
we
can
not
conceive
or
meditate
any
thing
that
is
right
in
the
sight
of
god
to
us
who
do
not
contentedly
submit
to
be
stripped
of
the
acuteness
of
our
reason
which
we
esteem
our
most
valuable
endowment
this
appears
too
harsh
but
in
the
estimation
of
the
holy
spirit
who
knows
that
all
the
thoughts
of
the
wisest
of
men
are
vain
and
who
plainly
pronounces
every
imagination
of
the
human
heart
to
be
only
evil
such
a
representation
is
consistent
with
the
strictest
truth
if
whatever
our
mind
conceives
agitates
undertakes
and
performs
be
invariably
evil
how
can
we
entertain
a
thought
of
undertaking
any
thing
acceptable
to
god
by
whom
nothing
is
accepted
but
holiness
and
righteousness
thus
it
is
evident
that
the
reason
of
our
mind
whithersoever
it
turns
is
unhappily
obnoxious
to
vanity
david
was
conscious
to
himself
of
this
imbecility
when
he
prayed
that
understanding
might
be
given
him
to
enable
him
rightly
to
learn
the
commandments
of
the
lord
for
his
desire
to
obtain
a
new
understanding
implies
the
total
insufficiency
of
his
own
and
this
he
does
not
once
but
almost
ten
times
in
one
psalm
he
repeats
the
same
repetition
indicating
the
greatness
of
the
necessity
which
urges
him
thus
to
pray
what
david
requests
for
himself
alone
paul
frequently
supplicates
for
the
churches
at
large
we
do
not
cease
to
pray
for
you
says
he
and
to
desire
that
ye
might
be
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
his
will
in
all
wisdom
and
spiritual
understanding
that
ye
might
walk
worthy
of
the
lord
unto
all
whenever
he
represents
that
as
a
blessing
of
god
we
should
remember
that
he
thereby
testifies
it
to
be
placed
beyond
the
ability
of
man
augustine
so
far
acknowledges
this
defect
of
reason
in
understanding
the
things
of
god
that
he
thinks
the
grace
of
illumination
no
less
necessary
to
our
minds
than
the
light
of
the
sun
to
our
eyes
and
not
content
with
this
he
subjoins
the
following
we
ourselves
open
our
eyes
to
behold
the
light
but
that
the
eyes
of
our
minds
remain
shut
unless
they
are
opened
by
the
lord
nor
does
the
scripture
teach
us
that
our
minds
are
illuminated
only
on
one
day
so
as
to
enable
them
to
see
afterwards
without
further
assistance
for
the
passage
just
quoted
from
paul
relates
to
continual
advances
and
improvements
and
this
is
clearly
expressed
by
david
in
these
words
with
my
whole
heart
have
i
sought
thee
o
let
me
not
wander
from
thy
for
after
having
been
regenerated
and
made
a
more
than
common
progress
in
true
piety
he
still
confesses
his
need
of
perpetual
direction
every
moment
lest
he
should
decline
from
that
knowledge
which
he
possessed
therefore
in
another
place
he
prays
for
the
renewal
of
a
right
spirit
which
he
had
lost
by
his
sin
because
it
belongs
to
the
same
god
to
restore
that
which
he
originally
bestowed
but
of
which
we
have
been
for
a
time
deprived
xxvi
we
must
now
proceed
to
the
examination
of
the
will
to
which
principally
belongs
the
liberty
of
choice
for
we
have
before
seen
that
election
belongs
rather
to
the
will
than
to
the
understanding
in
the
first
place
that
the
opinion
advanced
by
philosophers
and
received
by
general
consent
that
all
things
by
a
natural
instinct
desire
what
is
good
may
not
be
supposed
to
prove
the
rectitude
of
the
human
will
let
us
observe
that
the
power
of
free
choice
is
not
to
be
contemplated
in
that
kind
of
appetite
which
proceeds
rather
from
the
inclination
of
the
nature
than
from
the
deliberation
of
the
mind
for
even
the
schoolmen
confess
that
there
is
no
action
of
free
choice
but
when
reason
sees
and
considers
the
rival
objects
presented
to
it
meaning
that
the
object
of
appetite
must
be
such
as
is
the
subject
of
choice
and
that
deliberation
precedes
and
introduces
choice
and
in
fact
if
you
examine
the
desire
of
good
which
is
natural
to
man
you
will
find
that
he
has
it
in
common
with
the
brutes
for
they
also
desire
to
be
happy
and
pursue
every
agreeable
appearance
which
attracts
their
senses
but
man
neither
rationally
chooses
as
the
object
of
his
pursuit
that
which
is
truly
good
for
him
according
to
the
excellency
of
his
immortal
nature
nor
takes
the
advice
of
reason
nor
duly
exerts
his
understanding
but
without
reason
without
reflection
follows
his
natural
inclination
like
the
herds
of
the
field
it
is
therefore
no
argument
for
the
liberty
of
the
will
that
man
is
led
by
natural
instinct
to
desire
that
which
is
good
but
it
is
necessary
that
he
discern
what
is
good
according
to
right
reason
that
as
soon
as
he
knows
it
he
choose
it
and
as
soon
as
he
has
chosen
it
he
pursue
it
to
remove
every
difficulty
we
must
advert
to
two
instances
of
false
argumentation
for
the
desire
here
intended
is
not
a
proper
motion
of
the
will
but
a
natural
inclination
and
the
good
in
question
relates
not
to
virtue
or
righteousness
but
to
condition
as
when
we
say
a
man
is
well
or
in
good
health
lastly
though
man
has
the
strongest
desire
after
what
is
good
yet
he
does
not
pursue
it
there
is
no
man
to
whom
eternal
felicity
is
unwelcome
yet
no
man
aspires
to
it
without
the
influence
of
the
spirit
since
therefore
the
desire
of
happiness
natural
to
man
furnishes
no
argument
for
the
liberty
of
the
will
any
more
than
a
tendency
in
metals
and
stones
towards
the
perfection
of
their
nature
argues
liberty
in
them
let
us
consider
in
some
other
particulars
whether
the
will
be
in
every
part
so
entirely
vitiated
and
depraved
that
it
can
produce
nothing
but
what
is
evil
or
whether
it
retain
any
small
part
uninjured
which
may
be
the
source
of
good
desires
xxvii
those
who
attribute
it
to
the
first
grace
of
god
that
we
are
able
to
will
effectually
seem
on
the
contrary
to
imply
that
the
soul
has
a
faculty
of
spontaneously
aspiring
to
what
is
good
but
that
it
is
too
weak
to
rise
into
a
solid
affection
or
to
excite
any
endeavour
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
schoolmen
have
in
general
embraced
this
opinion
which
was
borrowed
from
origen
and
some
of
the
fathers
since
they
frequently
consider
man
in
things
purely
natural
as
they
express
themselves
according
to
the
description
given
by
the
apostle
in
these
words
the
good
that
i
would
i
do
not
but
the
evil
which
i
would
not
that
i
do
to
will
is
present
with
me
but
how
to
perform
that
which
is
good
i
find
but
this
is
a
miserable
and
complete
perversion
of
the
argument
which
paul
is
pursuing
in
that
passage
for
he
is
treating
of
the
christian
conflict
which
he
more
briefly
hints
at
to
the
galatians
the
conflict
which
the
faithful
perpetually
experience
within
themselves
in
the
contention
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
now
the
spirit
is
not
from
nature
but
from
regeneration
but
that
the
apostle
speaks
concerning
the
regenerate
is
evident
from
his
assertion
that
in
himself
dwelt
nothing
good
being
immediately
followed
by
an
explanation
that
he
meant
it
of
his
flesh
and
therefore
he
affirms
that
it
is
not
he
that
does
evil
but
sin
that
dwells
in
him
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
correction
in
me
that
is
in
my
flesh
it
is
as
if
he
had
expressed
himself
in
the
following
manner
no
good
resides
in
me
originating
from
myself
for
in
my
flesh
can
be
found
nothing
that
is
good
hence
follows
that
form
of
exculpation
i
do
no
evil
but
sin
that
dwelleth
in
me
which
is
inapplicable
to
any
but
the
regenerate
who
with
the
prevailing
bias
of
their
souls
aim
at
what
is
good
now
the
conclusion
which
is
subjoined
places
all
this
in
a
clear
point
of
view
i
delight
says
he
in
the
law
of
god
after
the
inward
man
but
i
see
another
law
in
my
members
warring
against
the
law
of
my
who
has
such
a
dissension
in
himself
but
he
who
being
regenerated
by
the
divine
spirit
carries
about
with
him
the
relics
of
his
flesh
therefore
augustine
though
he
had
at
one
time
supposed
that
discourse
to
relate
to
the
natural
state
of
man
retracted
his
interpretation
as
false
and
inconsistent
and
indeed
if
we
allow
that
men
destitute
of
grace
have
some
motions
towards
true
goodness
though
ever
so
feeble
what
answer
shall
we
give
to
the
apostle
who
denies
that
we
are
sufficient
of
ourselves
to
entertain
even
a
good
thought
what
reply
shall
we
make
to
the
lord
who
pronounces
by
the
mouth
of
moses
that
every
imagination
of
the
human
heart
is
only
evil
since
they
have
stumbled
on
a
false
interpretation
of
one
passage
therefore
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
dwell
on
their
opinion
rather
let
us
receive
this
declaration
of
christ
whosoever
committeth
sin
is
the
servant
of
we
are
all
sinners
by
nature
therefore
we
are
all
held
under
the
yoke
of
sin
now
if
the
whole
man
be
subject
to
the
dominion
of
sin
the
will
which
is
the
principal
seat
of
it
must
necessarily
be
bound
with
the
firmest
bonds
nor
would
there
otherwise
be
any
consistency
in
the
assertion
of
paul
that
it
is
god
that
worketh
in
us
to
will
if
any
will
preceded
the
grace
of
the
spirit
farewell
then
all
the
idle
observations
of
many
writers
concerning
preparation
for
although
the
faithful
sometimes
petition
that
their
hearts
may
be
conformed
to
the
divine
law
as
david
does
in
many
places
yet
it
should
be
remarked
that
even
this
desire
of
praying
originates
from
god
this
we
may
gather
from
the
language
of
david
for
when
he
wishes
a
clean
heart
to
be
created
within
him
he
certainly
does
not
arrogate
to
himself
the
beginning
of
such
a
creation
let
us
rather
therefore
attend
to
this
advice
of
augustine
god
will
prevent
you
in
all
things
do
you
also
sometimes
prevent
his
how
confess
that
you
have
all
those
things
from
god
that
whatever
good
you
have
it
is
from
him
but
whatever
evil
from
and
a
little
after
nothing
is
ours
but
chapter
iii
every
thing
that
proceeds
from
the
corrupt
nature
of
man
worthy
of
condemnation
but
man
can
not
be
better
known
in
either
faculty
of
his
soul
than
when
he
is
represented
in
those
characters
by
which
the
scripture
has
distinguished
him
if
he
be
completely
described
in
these
words
of
christ
that
which
is
born
of
the
flesh
is
flesh
as
it
is
easy
to
prove
it
is
evident
that
he
is
a
very
miserable
creature
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
apostle
to
be
carnally
minded
is
death
because
the
carnal
mind
is
enmity
against
god
for
it
is
not
subject
to
the
law
of
god
neither
indeed
can
is
the
flesh
so
perverse
that
with
all
its
affections
it
entertains
a
secret
hatred
against
god
that
it
can
not
consent
to
the
righteousness
of
the
divine
law
in
a
word
that
it
can
produce
nothing
but
what
tends
to
death
now
grant
that
in
the
nature
of
man
there
is
nothing
but
flesh
and
elicit
any
good
from
it
if
you
can
but
the
name
of
flesh
it
will
be
said
pertains
only
to
the
sensual
and
not
to
the
superior
faculties
of
the
soul
this
is
abundantly
refuted
by
the
words
of
christ
and
of
the
apostle
for
the
argument
of
our
lord
is
that
man
must
be
born
again
because
he
is
flesh
he
does
not
teach
a
new
birth
in
regard
to
the
body
now
a
new
birth
of
the
soul
requires
not
a
correction
of
some
portion
of
it
but
an
entire
renovation
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
antithesis
in
both
places
for
there
is
such
a
comparison
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
that
there
is
no
medium
left
therefore
every
thing
in
man
that
is
not
spiritual
is
according
to
this
mode
of
reasoning
denominated
carnal
but
we
have
nothing
of
the
spirit
except
by
regeneration
whatever
therefore
we
have
from
nature
is
carnal
but
if
on
that
point
there
could
otherwise
be
any
doubt
we
have
it
removed
by
paul
when
after
a
description
of
the
old
man
which
he
had
asserted
to
be
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
lusts
he
directs
us
to
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
our
you
see
that
he
places
unlawful
and
corrupt
affections
not
only
in
the
sensitive
part
but
also
in
the
mind
itself
and
therefore
requires
a
renovation
of
it
and
indeed
he
had
just
before
drawn
such
a
picture
of
human
nature
as
showed
us
to
be
in
every
part
corrupted
and
depraved
for
his
description
of
all
the
gentiles
as
walking
in
the
vanity
of
their
mind
having
the
understanding
darkened
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
god
through
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
heart
is
undoubtedly
applicable
to
all
those
whom
the
lord
has
not
yet
renewed
to
the
rectitude
of
his
wisdom
and
righteousness
this
is
still
more
evident
from
the
comparison
soon
after
introduced
where
he
reminds
the
faithful
that
they
have
not
so
learned
for
from
these
words
we
conclude
that
the
grace
of
christ
is
the
only
remedy
by
which
we
can
be
liberated
from
that
blindness
and
from
the
evils
consequent
upon
it
and
this
is
what
isaiah
had
prophesied
concerning
the
kingdom
of
christ
when
he
predicted
that
the
lord
would
be
an
everlasting
light
to
his
church
whilst
at
the
same
time
darkness
covered
the
earth
and
gross
darkness
the
when
he
declares
that
the
light
of
god
will
only
arise
upon
the
church
beyond
the
limits
of
the
church
he
certainly
leaves
nothing
but
darkness
and
blindness
i
will
not
particularly
recite
all
the
passages
which
are
to
be
found
especially
in
the
psalms
and
in
the
prophets
concerning
the
vanity
of
man
it
is
a
striking
observation
of
david
that
to
be
laid
in
the
balance
they
are
altogether
lighter
than
it
is
a
severe
condemnation
of
his
understanding
when
all
the
thoughts
which
proceed
from
it
are
derided
as
foolish
frivolous
mad
and
perverse
ii
equally
severe
is
the
condemnation
of
the
heart
when
it
is
called
deceitful
above
all
things
and
desperately
but
as
i
study
brevity
i
shall
be
content
with
citing
a
single
passage
which
however
will
resemble
a
very
lucid
mirror
in
which
we
may
behold
at
full
length
the
image
of
our
nature
for
the
apostle
when
he
wishes
to
demolish
the
arrogance
of
mankind
does
it
by
these
testimonies
there
is
none
righteous
no
not
one
there
is
none
that
understandeth
there
is
none
that
seeketh
after
god
they
are
all
gone
out
of
the
way
they
are
together
become
unprofitable
there
is
none
that
doeth
good
no
not
one
their
throat
is
an
open
sepulchre
with
their
tongues
they
have
used
deceit
the
poison
of
asps
is
under
their
lips
whose
mouth
is
full
of
cursing
and
bitterness
their
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
destruction
and
misery
are
in
their
ways
there
is
no
fear
of
god
before
their
in
this
terrible
manner
he
inveighs
not
against
particular
individuals
but
against
all
the
posterity
of
adam
he
does
not
declaim
against
the
depraved
manners
of
one
or
another
age
but
accuses
the
perpetual
corruption
of
our
nature
for
his
design
in
that
passage
is
not
simply
to
rebuke
men
in
order
that
they
may
repent
but
rather
to
teach
us
that
all
men
are
overwhelmed
with
an
inevitable
calamity
from
which
they
can
never
emerge
unless
they
are
extricated
by
the
mercy
of
god
as
this
could
not
be
proved
unless
it
were
evinced
by
the
ruin
and
destruction
of
our
nature
he
has
adduced
these
testimonies
which
demonstrate
our
nature
to
be
totally
ruined
let
this
then
be
admitted
that
men
are
such
as
they
are
here
described
not
only
by
corrupt
habits
but
also
by
a
depravity
of
nature
for
otherwise
the
reasoning
of
the
apostle
could
not
be
supported
that
there
is
no
salvation
for
man
but
from
the
mercy
of
god
since
in
himself
he
is
in
a
ruined
and
desperate
here
i
shall
not
attempt
to
establish
the
application
of
the
testimonies
to
preclude
the
appearance
of
their
being
improperly
introduced
i
shall
treat
them
just
as
if
they
had
been
originally
uttered
by
paul
and
not
quoted
from
the
prophets
he
divests
man
first
of
righteousness
that
is
integrity
and
purity
and
then
of
understanding
defect
of
understanding
is
proved
by
apostasy
from
god
the
seeking
of
whom
is
the
first
step
in
the
path
of
wisdom
but
this
loss
must
necessarily
befall
those
who
have
revolted
from
god
he
adds
that
all
have
gone
out
of
the
way
and
are
become
altogether
corrupt
that
there
is
not
one
that
does
good
then
he
subjoins
the
flagitious
crimes
with
which
they
who
are
once
abandoned
to
iniquity
contaminate
all
the
members
of
their
bodies
lastly
he
declares
them
to
be
destitute
of
the
fear
of
god
the
rule
by
which
all
our
steps
ought
to
be
directed
if
these
are
the
hereditary
characters
of
mankind
in
vain
do
we
seek
in
our
nature
for
any
thing
that
is
good
i
grant
indeed
that
all
these
crimes
are
not
exhibited
in
every
individual
yet
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
monster
lurks
in
the
hearts
of
all
for
as
the
body
which
already
contains
within
itself
the
cause
and
matter
of
a
disease
although
it
has
yet
no
sensation
of
pain
can
not
be
said
to
enjoy
good
health
neither
can
the
soul
be
esteemed
healthy
while
it
is
full
of
such
moral
maladies
although
this
similitude
will
not
correspond
in
every
particular
for
in
the
body
however
diseased
there
remains
the
vigour
of
life
but
the
soul
immersed
in
this
gulf
of
iniquity
is
not
only
the
subject
of
vices
but
totally
destitute
of
every
thing
that
is
good
iii
a
question
nearly
the
same
as
we
have
already
answered
here
presents
itself
to
us
again
for
in
all
ages
there
have
been
some
persons
who
from
the
mere
dictates
of
nature
have
devoted
their
whole
lives
to
the
pursuit
of
virtue
and
though
many
errors
might
perhaps
be
discovered
in
their
conduct
yet
by
their
pursuit
of
virtue
they
afforded
a
proof
that
there
was
some
degree
of
purity
in
their
nature
the
value
attached
to
virtues
of
such
a
description
before
god
we
shall
more
fully
discuss
when
we
come
to
treat
of
the
merits
of
works
yet
it
must
be
stated
also
in
this
place
so
far
as
is
necessary
for
the
elucidation
of
the
present
subject
these
examples
then
seem
to
teach
us
that
we
should
not
consider
human
nature
to
be
totally
corrupted
since
from
its
instinctive
bias
some
men
have
not
only
been
eminent
for
noble
actions
but
have
uniformly
conducted
themselves
in
a
most
virtuous
manner
through
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
but
here
we
ought
to
remember
that
amidst
this
corruption
of
nature
there
is
some
room
for
divine
grace
not
to
purify
it
but
internally
to
restrain
its
operations
for
should
the
lord
permit
the
minds
of
all
men
to
give
up
the
reins
to
every
lawless
passion
there
certainly
would
not
be
an
individual
in
the
world
whose
actions
would
not
evince
all
the
crimes
for
which
paul
condemns
human
nature
in
general
to
be
most
truly
applicable
to
him
for
can
you
except
yourself
from
the
number
of
those
whose
feet
are
swift
to
shed
blood
whose
hands
are
polluted
with
rapine
and
murder
whose
throats
are
like
open
sepulchres
whose
tongues
are
deceitful
whose
lips
are
envenomed
whose
works
are
useless
iniquitous
corrupt
and
deadly
whose
souls
are
estranged
from
god
the
inmost
recesses
of
whose
hearts
are
full
of
pravity
whose
eyes
are
insidiously
employed
whose
minds
are
elated
with
a
word
all
whose
powers
are
prepared
for
the
commission
of
atrocious
and
innumerable
crimes
if
every
soul
be
subject
to
all
these
monstrous
vices
as
the
apostle
fearlessly
pronounces
we
clearly
see
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
the
lord
should
suffer
the
human
passions
to
go
all
the
lengths
to
which
they
are
inclined
there
is
no
furious
beast
that
would
be
agitated
with
such
ungovernable
rage
there
is
no
river
though
ever
so
rapid
and
violent
that
would
overflow
its
boundaries
with
such
impetuosity
in
his
elect
the
lord
heals
these
maladies
by
a
method
which
we
shall
hereafter
describe
in
others
he
restrains
them
only
to
prevent
their
ebullitions
so
far
as
he
sees
to
be
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
universe
hence
some
by
shame
and
some
by
fear
of
the
laws
are
prevented
from
running
into
many
kinds
of
pollutions
though
they
can
not
in
any
great
degree
dissemble
their
impurity
others
because
they
think
that
a
virtuous
course
of
life
is
advantageous
entertain
some
languid
desires
after
it
others
go
further
and
display
more
than
common
excellence
that
by
their
majesty
they
may
confine
the
vulgar
to
their
duty
thus
god
by
his
providence
restrains
the
perverseness
of
our
nature
from
breaking
out
into
external
acts
but
does
not
purify
it
within
iv
but
it
may
be
said
the
difficulty
is
not
yet
removed
for
either
we
must
esteem
camillus
to
be
exactly
similar
to
catiline
or
in
camillus
we
shall
have
an
example
that
nature
if
it
be
studiously
cultivated
is
not
altogether
destitute
of
goodness
i
grant
indeed
that
the
virtues
displayed
in
camillus
were
gifts
of
god
and
if
considered
in
themselves
appear
justly
worthy
of
commendation
but
how
will
they
be
proofs
of
any
natural
goodness
in
him
to
establish
this
must
we
not
recur
to
the
heart
and
argue
that
if
a
natural
man
was
eminent
for
such
integrity
of
manners
human
nature
is
not
destitute
of
ability
for
the
pursuit
of
virtue
but
what
if
his
heart
was
depraved
and
perverted
and
followed
any
thing
rather
than
the
path
of
rectitude
and
that
it
was
such
if
you
concede
that
he
was
a
natural
man
is
beyond
all
doubt
what
ability
then
will
you
attribute
to
human
nature
for
the
pursuit
of
virtue
if
with
the
greatest
appearance
of
integrity
it
is
discovered
to
be
always
tending
to
corruption
therefore
as
you
will
not
commend
a
man
for
virtue
whose
vices
have
only
counterfeited
the
external
form
of
virtue
so
you
must
not
attribute
to
the
human
will
a
power
of
desiring
what
is
right
as
long
as
it
continues
fixed
in
its
perverseness
the
most
certain
and
easy
solution
of
this
question
however
is
that
those
virtues
are
not
the
common
properties
of
nature
but
the
peculiar
graces
of
god
which
he
dispenses
in
great
variety
and
in
a
certain
degree
to
men
that
are
otherwise
profane
for
which
reason
we
hesitate
not
in
common
speech
to
call
the
nature
of
one
man
good
and
of
another
depraved
yet
we
still
include
both
in
the
universal
state
of
human
depravity
but
we
signify
what
peculiar
grace
god
has
conferred
on
the
one
with
which
he
has
not
deigned
to
favour
the
other
when
he
determined
to
exalt
saul
to
the
kingdom
he
made
him
as
it
were
a
new
man
and
this
is
the
reason
why
plato
alluding
to
the
fable
of
homer
says
that
the
sons
of
kings
are
formed
with
some
distinguishing
singularity
of
character
because
god
consulting
the
benefit
of
mankind
frequently
furnishes
with
an
heroic
nature
those
whom
he
destines
to
hold
the
reins
of
empire
and
from
this
source
have
proceeded
all
the
exploits
of
great
heroes
which
are
celebrated
in
history
the
same
judgment
must
be
formed
concerning
those
also
who
are
in
a
private
station
but
because
every
one
who
has
risen
to
great
eminence
has
been
impelled
by
his
ambition
which
defiles
all
virtues
and
deprives
them
of
all
excellence
in
the
divine
view
whatever
may
be
apparently
laudable
in
ungodly
men
ought
not
to
be
esteemed
at
all
meritorious
besides
the
chief
branch
of
rectitude
is
wanting
where
there
is
no
concern
to
display
the
glory
of
god
of
this
principle
all
are
destitute
whom
he
has
not
regenerated
by
his
spirit
nor
is
it
in
vain
that
isaiah
says
that
the
spirit
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
christ
which
teaches
us
that
all
who
are
alienated
from
christ
are
destitute
of
that
fear
of
the
lord
which
is
the
beginning
of
the
virtues
which
deceive
us
by
their
vain
and
specious
appearance
will
be
applauded
in
civil
courts
and
in
the
common
estimation
of
mankind
but
before
the
celestial
tribunal
they
will
possess
no
value
to
merit
the
reward
of
righteousness
the
will
therefore
is
so
bound
by
the
slavery
of
sin
that
it
can
not
excite
itself
much
less
devote
itself
to
any
thing
good
for
such
a
disposition
is
the
beginning
of
a
conversion
to
god
which
in
the
scriptures
is
attributed
solely
to
divine
grace
thus
jeremiah
prays
to
the
lord
to
convert
or
turn
him
if
he
would
have
him
to
be
turned
whence
the
prophet
in
the
same
chapter
describing
the
spiritual
redemption
of
the
faithful
says
the
lord
hath
redeemed
jacob
and
ransomed
him
from
the
hand
of
him
that
was
stronger
than
he
alluding
to
the
strong
fetters
with
which
the
sinner
is
bound
as
long
as
he
is
deserted
by
the
lord
and
continues
under
the
yoke
of
the
devil
nevertheless
there
still
remains
the
faculty
of
will
which
with
the
strongest
propensity
is
inclined
to
and
rushes
into
sin
for
when
man
subjected
himself
to
this
necessity
he
was
not
deprived
of
his
will
but
of
soundness
of
will
bernard
properly
observes
that
we
all
have
a
power
to
will
but
that
to
will
what
is
good
is
an
advantage
to
will
what
is
evil
a
defect
therefore
simply
to
will
belongs
to
man
to
will
what
is
evil
to
corrupt
nature
to
will
what
is
good
to
grace
now
when
i
assert
that
the
will
being
deprived
of
its
liberty
is
necessarily
drawn
or
led
into
evil
i
should
wonder
if
any
one
considered
it
as
a
harsh
expression
since
it
has
nothing
in
it
absurd
nor
is
it
unsanctioned
by
the
custom
of
good
men
it
offends
those
who
know
not
how
to
distinguish
between
necessity
and
compulsion
but
if
any
one
should
ask
them
whether
god
is
not
necessarily
good
and
whether
the
devil
is
not
necessarily
evil
answer
will
they
make
for
there
is
such
a
close
connection
between
the
goodness
of
god
and
his
deity
that
his
being
god
is
not
more
necessary
than
his
being
good
but
the
devil
is
by
his
fall
so
alienated
from
communion
with
all
that
is
good
that
he
can
do
nothing
but
what
is
evil
but
if
any
one
should
sacrilegiously
object
that
little
praise
is
due
to
god
for
his
goodness
which
he
is
constrained
to
preserve
we
not
readily
reply
that
his
inability
to
do
evil
arises
from
his
infinite
goodness
and
not
from
the
impulse
of
violence
therefore
if
a
necessity
of
doing
well
impairs
not
the
liberty
of
the
divine
will
in
doing
well
if
the
devil
who
can
not
but
do
evil
nevertheless
sins
voluntarily
who
then
will
assert
that
man
sins
less
voluntarily
because
he
is
under
a
necessity
of
sinning
this
necessity
augustine
every
where
maintains
and
even
when
he
was
pressed
with
the
cavils
of
celestius
who
tried
to
throw
an
odium
on
this
doctrine
he
confidently
expressed
himself
in
these
terms
by
means
of
liberty
it
came
to
pass
that
man
fell
into
sin
but
now
the
penal
depravity
consequent
on
it
instead
of
liberty
has
introduced
and
whenever
the
mention
of
this
subject
occurs
he
hesitates
not
to
speak
in
this
manner
of
the
necessary
servitude
of
sin
we
must
therefore
observe
this
grand
point
of
distinction
that
man
having
been
corrupted
by
his
fall
sins
voluntarily
not
with
reluctance
or
constraint
with
the
strongest
propensity
of
disposition
not
with
violent
coercion
with
the
bias
of
his
own
passions
and
not
with
external
compulsion
yet
such
is
the
pravity
of
his
nature
that
he
can
not
be
excited
and
biassed
to
any
thing
but
what
is
evil
if
this
be
true
there
is
no
impropriety
in
affirming
that
he
is
under
a
necessity
of
sinning
bernard
subscribing
to
what
is
said
by
augustine
thus
expresses
himself
among
all
the
animals
man
alone
is
free
and
yet
by
the
intervention
of
sin
he
also
suffers
a
species
of
violence
but
from
the
will
not
from
nature
so
that
he
is
not
thereby
deprived
of
his
innate
for
what
is
voluntary
is
also
free
and
a
little
after
the
will
being
by
i
know
not
what
corrupt
and
surprising
means
changed
for
the
worse
is
itself
the
author
of
the
necessity
to
which
it
is
subject
so
that
neither
necessity
being
voluntary
can
excuse
the
will
nor
the
will
being
fascinated
can
exclude
for
this
necessity
is
in
some
measure
voluntary
afterwards
he
says
that
we
are
oppressed
with
a
yoke
but
no
other
than
that
of
a
voluntary
servitude
that
therefore
our
servitude
renders
us
miserable
and
our
will
renders
us
inexcusable
because
the
will
when
it
was
free
made
itself
the
slave
of
sin
at
length
he
concludes
thus
the
soul
in
a
certain
strange
and
evil
manner
under
this
kind
of
voluntary
and
free
yet
pernicious
necessity
is
both
enslaved
and
free
enslaved
by
necessity
free
by
its
will
and
what
is
more
wonderful
and
more
miserable
it
is
guilty
because
free
and
enslaved
wherein
it
is
guilty
and
so
therein
enslaved
wherein
it
is
from
these
passages
the
reader
clearly
perceives
that
i
am
teaching
no
novel
doctrine
but
what
was
long
ago
advanced
by
augustine
with
the
universal
consent
of
pious
men
and
which
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
after
was
confined
to
the
cloisters
of
monks
but
lombard
for
want
of
knowing
how
to
distinguish
necessity
from
coaction
gave
rise
to
a
pernicious
error
vi
it
is
necessary
on
the
other
hand
to
consider
the
remedy
of
divine
grace
by
which
the
depravity
of
nature
is
corrected
and
healed
for
since
the
lord
in
the
assistance
which
he
affords
us
bestows
on
us
that
which
we
need
an
exhibition
of
the
nature
of
his
work
in
us
will
immediately
discover
the
nature
of
our
necessity
when
the
apostle
tells
the
philippians
that
he
is
confident
that
he
which
hath
begun
a
good
work
in
them
will
perform
it
until
the
day
of
jesus
christ
by
the
beginning
of
a
good
work
he
undoubtedly
designs
the
commencement
of
conversion
which
takes
place
in
the
will
therefore
god
begins
the
good
work
in
us
by
exciting
in
our
hearts
a
love
desire
and
ardent
pursuit
of
righteousness
or
to
speak
more
properly
by
bending
forming
and
directing
our
hearts
towards
righteousness
but
he
completes
it
by
confirming
us
to
perseverance
that
no
one
may
cavil
that
the
good
work
is
begun
by
the
lord
inasmuch
as
the
will
which
is
weak
of
itself
is
assisted
by
him
the
spirit
declares
in
another
place
how
far
the
ability
of
the
will
reaches
when
left
to
itself
a
new
heart
also
says
he
will
i
give
you
and
a
new
spirit
will
i
put
within
you
and
i
will
take
away
the
stony
heart
out
of
your
flesh
and
i
will
give
you
a
heart
of
flesh
and
i
will
put
my
spirit
within
you
and
cause
you
to
walk
in
my
who
will
assert
that
the
infirmity
of
the
human
will
is
only
strengthened
by
assistance
to
enable
it
efficaciously
to
aspire
to
the
choice
of
that
which
is
good
when
it
actually
needs
a
total
transformation
and
renovation
if
there
be
in
a
stone
any
softness
which
by
some
application
being
made
more
tender
would
be
flexible
in
every
direction
then
i
will
not
deny
the
flexibility
of
the
human
heart
to
the
obedience
of
rectitude
provided
its
imperfections
are
supplied
by
the
grace
of
god
but
if
by
this
similitude
the
lord
intended
to
show
that
no
good
will
ever
be
extracted
from
our
hearts
unless
they
are
entirely
renewed
let
us
not
divide
between
him
and
us
what
he
claims
exclusively
to
himself
if
therefore
when
god
converts
us
to
the
pursuit
of
rectitude
this
change
is
like
the
transformation
of
a
stone
into
flesh
it
follows
that
whatever
belongs
to
our
own
will
is
removed
and
what
succeeds
to
it
is
entirely
from
god
the
will
i
say
is
removed
not
considered
as
the
will
because
in
the
conversion
of
man
the
properties
of
our
original
nature
remain
entire
i
assert
also
that
it
is
created
anew
not
that
the
will
then
begins
to
exist
but
that
it
is
then
converted
from
an
evil
into
a
good
one
this
i
affirm
to
be
done
entirely
by
god
because
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
same
apostle
we
are
not
sufficient
even
to
therefore
he
elsewhere
declares
not
merely
that
god
assists
the
infirmity
of
our
will
or
corrects
its
depravity
but
that
he
worketh
in
us
to
whence
it
is
easy
to
infer
what
i
have
already
remarked
that
whatever
good
is
in
the
human
will
is
the
work
of
pure
grace
in
the
same
sense
he
elsewhere
pronounces
that
it
is
god
which
worketh
all
in
for
in
that
place
he
is
not
discussing
the
government
of
the
universe
but
asserting
that
the
praise
of
all
the
excellences
found
in
the
faithful
belongs
to
god
alone
and
by
using
the
word
all
he
certainly
makes
god
the
author
of
spiritual
life
from
its
commencement
even
to
its
termination
this
is
the
same
as
he
had
before
taught
in
other
words
declaring
that
the
faithful
are
of
god
in
christ
where
he
evidently
intends
the
new
creation
by
which
what
belonged
to
our
common
nature
is
abolished
for
we
must
here
understand
an
implied
contrast
between
adam
and
christ
which
he
states
more
plainly
in
another
place
where
he
teaches
that
we
are
the
workmanship
of
god
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
for
by
this
argument
he
designs
to
prove
that
our
salvation
is
gratuitous
because
the
beginning
of
all
good
is
from
the
second
creation
which
we
obtain
in
christ
now
if
we
possessed
any
ability
though
ever
so
small
we
should
also
have
some
portion
of
merit
but
to
annihilate
all
our
pretensions
he
argues
that
we
have
merited
nothing
because
we
are
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
in
which
expressions
he
again
signifies
that
all
the
parts
of
good
works
even
from
the
first
inclination
of
the
mind
are
entirely
from
god
for
this
reason
the
psalmist
after
having
said
that
he
god
hath
made
us
that
there
may
be
no
division
of
the
work
immediately
subjoins
and
not
we
that
he
speaks
of
regeneration
which
is
the
commencement
of
the
spiritual
life
is
evident
from
the
context
where
it
follows
immediately
after
that
we
are
his
people
and
the
sheep
of
his
we
see
then
that
not
content
with
having
simply
attributed
to
god
the
praise
of
our
salvation
he
expressly
excludes
us
from
all
fellowship
with
him
as
though
he
would
say
that
man
has
not
even
the
smallest
particle
remaining
in
which
he
can
glory
because
all
is
of
god
vii
but
there
may
be
some
who
will
concede
that
the
will
being
of
its
own
spontaneous
inclination
averse
to
what
is
good
is
converted
solely
by
the
power
of
the
lord
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
being
previously
prepared
it
has
also
its
own
share
in
the
work
that
grace
as
augustine
teaches
precedes
every
good
work
the
will
following
grace
not
leading
it
being
its
companion
not
its
guide
this
unobjectionable
observation
of
that
holy
man
peter
lombard
preposterously
wrests
to
an
erroneous
meaning
now
i
contend
that
both
in
the
words
of
the
prophet
which
i
have
cited
and
in
other
passages
these
two
things
are
clearly
signified
that
the
lord
corrects
our
depraved
will
or
rather
removes
it
and
of
himself
introduces
a
good
one
in
its
place
as
it
is
preceded
by
grace
i
allow
you
to
style
it
an
attendant
but
since
its
reformation
is
the
work
of
the
lord
it
is
wrong
to
attribute
to
man
a
voluntary
obedience
in
following
the
guidance
of
grace
therefore
it
is
not
a
proper
expression
of
chrysostom
that
grace
is
able
to
effect
nothing
without
the
will
nor
the
will
without
grace
as
if
grace
did
not
produce
the
will
itself
as
we
have
just
seen
from
paul
nor
was
it
the
intention
of
augustine
when
he
called
the
human
will
the
companion
of
grace
to
assign
to
it
any
secondary
office
next
to
grace
in
the
good
work
but
with
a
view
to
refute
the
nefarious
dogma
broached
by
pelagius
who
made
the
prime
cause
of
salvation
to
consist
in
human
merit
he
contends
what
was
sufficient
for
his
present
argument
that
grace
is
prior
to
all
merit
omitting
at
this
time
the
other
question
concerning
the
perpetual
efficiency
of
grace
which
is
admirably
treated
by
him
on
other
occasions
for
when
he
frequently
says
that
the
lord
precedes
the
unwilling
that
he
may
will
and
follows
the
willing
that
he
may
not
will
in
vain
he
makes
him
the
sole
author
of
the
good
work
his
language
on
this
subject
is
too
explicit
to
require
much
argument
men
labour
says
he
to
discover
in
our
will
something
that
is
our
own
and
not
derived
from
god
and
how
any
such
discovery
can
be
made
i
know
in
his
first
book
against
pelagius
and
celestius
where
he
explains
that
declaration
of
christ
every
man
that
hath
heard
of
the
father
cometh
unto
me
he
says
that
the
will
is
assisted
so
as
to
enable
it
not
only
to
know
its
duty
but
what
it
knows
also
to
and
thus
when
god
teaches
not
by
the
letter
of
the
law
but
by
the
grace
of
the
spirit
he
teaches
in
such
a
manner
that
whatever
each
one
has
learned
he
not
only
sees
in
knowing
it
but
desires
in
willing
and
performs
in
doing
viii
and
as
we
are
now
engaged
on
the
principal
point
of
the
argument
let
us
give
the
reader
a
summary
of
the
doctrine
and
prove
it
by
a
few
very
clear
testimonies
of
scripture
and
then
that
no
one
may
accuse
us
of
perverting
the
scripture
let
us
also
show
that
the
truth
which
we
assert
to
be
deduced
from
the
scripture
is
not
destitute
of
the
support
of
this
holy
man
i
mean
augustine
for
i
conceive
it
is
unnecessary
to
recite
in
regular
order
all
the
passages
which
might
be
adduced
from
the
scriptures
in
confirmation
of
our
opinion
provided
that
the
selection
which
shall
be
made
prepares
a
way
to
the
understanding
of
all
the
rest
which
are
frequently
to
be
found
nor
do
i
think
that
there
will
be
any
impropriety
in
evincing
my
agreement
with
that
man
to
whose
authority
the
consent
of
the
pious
pays
a
great
and
merited
deference
the
origin
of
all
good
clearly
appears
from
a
plain
and
certain
reason
to
be
from
no
other
than
from
god
alone
for
no
propensity
of
the
will
to
any
thing
good
can
be
found
but
in
the
elect
but
the
cause
of
election
must
not
be
sought
in
men
whence
we
may
conclude
that
man
has
not
a
good
will
from
himself
but
that
it
proceeds
from
the
same
decree
by
which
we
were
elected
before
the
creation
of
the
world
there
is
also
another
reason
not
dissimilar
for
since
good
volitions
and
good
actions
both
arise
from
faith
we
must
see
whence
faith
itself
originates
now
since
the
scripture
uniformly
proclaims
it
to
be
the
gratuitous
gift
of
god
it
follows
that
it
is
the
effect
of
mere
grace
when
we
who
are
naturally
and
completely
prone
to
evil
begin
to
will
any
thing
that
is
good
therefore
the
lord
when
he
mentions
these
two
things
in
the
conversion
of
his
people
that
he
takes
away
from
them
their
stony
heart
and
gives
them
a
heart
of
flesh
plainly
declares
that
what
originates
from
ourselves
must
be
removed
that
we
may
be
converted
to
righteousness
and
that
whatever
succeeds
in
its
place
proceeds
from
himself
nor
is
it
only
in
one
passage
that
he
announces
this
for
he
says
in
jeremiah
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
one
way
that
they
may
fear
me
for
and
a
little
after
i
will
put
my
fear
in
their
hearts
that
they
shall
not
depart
from
again
in
ezekiel
i
will
give
them
one
heart
and
will
put
a
new
spirit
within
you
and
i
will
take
the
stony
heart
out
of
their
flesh
and
will
give
them
a
heart
of
he
could
not
more
evidently
claim
to
himself
and
take
from
us
all
that
is
good
and
upright
in
our
will
than
when
he
declares
our
conversion
to
be
the
creation
of
a
new
spirit
and
of
a
new
heart
for
it
always
follows
that
nothing
good
proceeds
from
our
will
till
it
be
renovated
and
that
after
its
renovation
as
far
as
it
is
good
it
is
from
god
and
not
from
ourselves
ix
and
we
find
the
saints
have
made
this
the
subject
of
their
prayers
solomon
prayed
may
the
lord
incline
our
hearts
unto
him
to
keep
his
he
shows
the
stubbornness
of
our
heart
which
unless
a
new
bias
be
given
to
it
naturally
indulges
itself
in
rebellion
against
the
divine
law
the
same
petition
is
offered
by
the
psalmist
incline
my
heart
unto
thy
for
we
should
always
remark
the
opposition
between
the
perverse
bias
of
the
heart
which
inclines
it
to
rebellion
and
this
correction
which
constrains
it
to
obedience
but
when
david
perceiving
himself
to
be
for
a
time
deprived
of
the
direction
of
grace
prays
that
god
would
create
in
him
a
clean
heart
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
him
does
he
not
acknowledge
that
all
the
parts
of
his
heart
are
full
of
impurity
and
his
spirit
warped
by
a
depraved
obliquity
and
by
calling
the
purity
which
he
earnestly
implores
the
creation
of
god
does
he
not
ascribe
it
entirely
to
him
if
any
one
object
that
the
petition
itself
is
a
proof
of
a
pious
and
holy
affection
the
answer
is
easy
that
although
david
had
already
partly
repented
yet
he
compares
his
former
state
with
that
melancholy
fall
which
he
had
experienced
assuming
the
character
therefore
of
a
man
alienated
from
god
he
properly
requests
for
himself
all
those
things
which
god
confers
on
his
elect
in
regeneration
resembling
a
dead
man
therefore
he
prays
to
be
created
anew
that
instead
of
being
the
slave
of
satan
he
may
become
the
instrument
of
the
holy
spirit
truly
wonderful
and
monstrous
is
the
extravagance
of
our
pride
god
requires
of
us
nothing
more
severe
than
that
we
most
religiously
observe
his
sabbath
by
resting
from
our
own
works
but
there
is
nothing
which
we
find
more
difficult
or
to
which
we
are
more
reluctant
than
to
bid
farewell
to
our
own
works
in
order
to
give
the
works
of
god
their
proper
place
if
there
were
no
obstacle
arising
from
our
folly
christ
has
given
a
testimony
to
his
graces
sufficiently
clear
to
prevent
them
from
being
wickedly
suppressed
i
am
the
vine
says
he
ye
are
the
branches
my
father
is
the
husbandman
as
the
branch
can
not
bear
fruit
of
itself
except
it
abide
in
the
vine
no
more
can
ye
except
ye
abide
in
me
for
without
me
ye
can
do
if
we
can
not
bear
fruit
of
ourselves
any
more
than
a
branch
can
bud
after
it
is
torn
up
from
the
ground
and
deprived
of
moisture
we
must
no
longer
seek
for
any
aptitude
in
our
nature
to
that
which
is
good
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
this
conclusion
without
me
ye
can
do
he
does
not
say
that
we
are
too
weak
to
be
sufficient
for
ourselves
but
reducing
us
to
nothing
excludes
every
idea
of
ability
however
diminutive
if
being
engrafted
into
christ
we
bear
fruit
like
a
vine
which
derives
the
energy
of
vegetation
from
the
moisture
of
the
earth
from
the
dew
of
heaven
and
from
the
benign
influences
of
the
sun
i
see
nothing
of
our
own
remaining
in
any
good
work
if
we
preserve
entire
to
god
the
honour
which
belongs
to
him
it
is
in
vain
to
urge
that
frivolous
subtlety
that
the
branch
already
possesses
sap
and
a
fructifying
power
and
that
therefore
it
does
not
derive
all
from
the
earth
or
from
the
original
root
because
it
contributes
something
of
its
own
for
the
meaning
of
christ
is
clearly
that
we
are
as
a
dry
and
worthless
log
when
separated
from
him
because
independently
of
him
we
have
no
ability
to
do
good
as
he
says
also
in
another
place
every
plant
which
my
heavenly
father
has
not
planted
shall
be
rooted
wherefore
the
apostle
ascribes
all
the
praise
to
him
in
the
place
already
cited
it
is
god
says
he
which
worketh
in
you
both
to
will
and
to
the
first
part
of
a
good
work
is
volition
the
next
an
effectual
endeavour
to
perform
it
god
is
the
author
of
both
therefore
we
rob
the
lord
if
we
arrogate
any
thing
to
ourselves
either
in
volition
or
in
execution
if
god
were
said
to
assist
the
infirmity
of
our
will
then
there
would
be
something
left
to
us
but
since
he
is
said
to
produce
the
will
all
the
good
that
is
in
it
is
placed
without
us
and
because
the
good
will
is
still
oppressed
by
the
burden
of
our
flesh
so
that
it
can
not
extricate
itself
he
has
added
that
in
struggling
with
the
difficulties
of
that
conflict
we
are
supplied
with
constancy
of
exertion
to
carry
our
volitions
into
effect
for
otherwise
there
would
be
no
truth
in
what
he
elsewhere
teaches
that
it
is
the
same
god
which
worketh
all
in
all
which
we
have
before
shown
comprehends
the
whole
course
of
the
spiritual
life
for
which
reason
david
after
having
prayed
that
the
way
of
god
may
be
discovered
to
him
that
he
may
walk
in
his
truth
immediately
adds
unite
my
heart
to
fear
thy
in
these
words
he
intimates
that
even
good
men
are
subject
to
so
many
distractions
of
mind
that
they
soon
wander
and
fall
unless
they
are
strengthened
to
persevere
for
the
same
reason
in
another
passage
having
prayed
that
his
steps
might
be
ordered
in
the
word
of
the
lord
he
likewise
implores
strength
for
a
warfare
let
not
any
iniquity
have
dominion
over
in
this
manner
therefore
the
lord
both
begins
and
completes
the
good
work
in
us
that
it
may
be
owing
to
him
that
the
will
conceives
a
love
for
what
is
right
that
it
is
inclined
to
desire
it
and
is
excited
and
impelled
to
endeavour
to
attain
it
and
then
that
the
choice
desire
and
endeavour
do
not
fail
but
proceed
even
to
the
completion
of
the
desired
effect
lastly
that
a
man
proceeds
with
constancy
in
them
and
perseveres
even
to
the
end
x
and
he
moves
the
will
not
according
to
the
system
maintained
and
believed
for
many
ages
in
such
a
manner
that
it
would
afterwards
be
at
our
option
either
to
obey
the
impulse
or
to
resist
it
but
by
an
efficacious
influence
the
observation
therefore
so
frequently
repeated
by
chrysostom
that
whom
god
draws
he
draws
willing
we
are
obliged
to
reject
being
an
insinuation
that
god
only
waits
for
us
with
his
hand
extended
if
we
choose
to
accept
his
assistance
we
grant
that
such
was
the
primitive
condition
of
man
during
his
state
of
integrity
that
he
could
incline
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
but
since
adam
has
taught
us
by
his
own
example
how
miserable
free
will
is
unless
god
give
us
both
will
and
power
what
will
become
of
us
if
he
impart
his
grace
to
us
in
that
small
proportion
nay
we
obscure
and
diminish
his
grace
by
our
ingratitude
for
the
apostle
does
not
teach
that
the
grace
of
a
good
will
is
offered
to
us
for
our
acceptance
but
that
he
worketh
in
us
to
will
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
lord
by
his
spirit
directs
inclines
and
governs
our
heart
and
reigns
in
it
as
in
his
own
possession
nor
does
he
promise
by
ezekiel
that
he
will
give
to
the
elect
a
new
spirit
only
that
they
may
be
able
to
walk
but
that
they
may
actually
walk
in
his
precepts
nor
can
the
declaration
of
christ
every
man
that
hath
heard
of
the
father
cometh
unto
me
be
understood
in
any
other
sense
than
as
a
proof
of
the
positive
efficacy
of
divine
grace
as
augustine
also
contends
this
grace
the
lord
deigns
not
to
give
to
any
person
promiscuously
according
to
the
observation
commonly
attributed
if
i
mistake
not
to
occam
that
it
is
denied
to
no
man
who
does
what
he
can
men
are
to
be
taught
indeed
that
the
divine
benignity
is
free
to
all
who
seek
it
without
any
exception
but
since
none
begin
to
seek
it
but
those
who
have
been
inspired
by
heavenly
grace
not
even
this
diminutive
portion
ought
to
be
taken
from
his
praise
this
is
the
privilege
of
the
elect
that
being
regenerated
by
the
spirit
of
god
they
are
led
and
governed
by
his
direction
wherefore
augustine
as
justly
ridicules
those
who
arrogate
to
themselves
any
part
of
a
good
volition
as
he
reprehends
others
who
suppose
that
to
be
given
promiscuously
to
all
which
is
the
special
evidence
of
gratuitous
election
nature
says
he
is
common
to
all
men
but
not
he
calls
it
a
transparent
subtlety
which
shines
merely
with
vanity
when
that
is
extended
generally
to
all
which
god
confers
on
whom
he
but
elsewhere
how
have
you
come
by
believing
be
afraid
lest
while
you
arrogate
to
yourself
the
discovery
of
the
way
of
righteousness
you
perish
from
the
way
of
righteousness
i
am
come
you
say
by
free
will
i
am
come
through
my
own
choice
why
are
you
inflated
with
pride
will
you
know
that
this
also
is
given
to
you
hear
him
proclaiming
no
man
can
come
to
me
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
and
it
incontrovertibly
follows
from
the
words
of
john
that
the
hearts
of
the
pious
are
divinely
governed
with
such
effect
that
they
follow
with
an
affection
which
nothing
can
alter
whosoever
is
born
of
god
he
says
can
not
sin
for
his
seed
remaineth
in
for
we
see
that
the
neutral
inefficacious
impulse
imagined
by
the
sophists
which
every
one
would
be
at
liberty
to
obey
or
resist
is
evidently
excluded
where
it
is
asserted
that
god
gives
a
constancy
that
is
effectual
to
perseverance
xi
concerning
perseverance
there
would
have
been
no
doubt
that
it
ought
to
be
esteemed
the
gratuitous
gift
of
god
had
it
not
been
for
the
prevalence
of
a
pestilent
error
that
it
is
dispensed
according
to
the
merit
of
men
in
proportion
to
the
gratitude
which
each
person
has
discovered
for
the
grace
bestowed
on
him
but
as
that
opinion
arose
from
the
supposition
that
it
was
at
our
own
option
to
reject
or
accept
the
offered
grace
of
god
this
notion
being
exploded
the
other
falls
of
course
though
here
is
a
double
error
for
beside
teaching
that
our
gratitude
for
the
grace
first
bestowed
on
us
and
our
legitimate
use
of
that
grace
are
remunerated
by
subsequent
blessings
they
add
also
that
now
grace
does
not
operate
alone
in
us
but
only
coöperates
with
us
on
the
first
point
we
must
admit
that
the
lord
while
he
daily
enriches
and
loads
his
servants
with
new
communications
of
his
grace
perceiving
the
work
which
he
has
begun
in
them
grateful
and
acceptable
discovers
something
in
them
which
he
blesses
with
still
greater
degrees
of
grace
and
this
is
implied
in
the
following
declarations
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
be
and
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
thou
hast
been
faithful
over
a
few
things
i
will
make
thee
ruler
over
many
but
here
two
errors
must
be
avoided
the
legitimate
use
of
the
grace
first
bestowed
must
not
be
said
to
be
rewarded
with
subsequent
degrees
of
grace
as
though
man
by
his
own
industry
rendered
the
grace
of
god
efficacious
nor
must
it
be
accounted
a
remuneration
in
such
a
sense
as
to
cease
to
be
esteemed
the
free
favour
of
god
i
grant
then
that
this
divine
benediction
is
to
be
expected
by
the
faithful
that
the
better
they
have
used
the
former
measures
of
grace
they
shall
afterwards
be
enriched
with
proportionably
greater
degrees
of
it
but
i
assert
that
this
use
also
is
from
the
lord
and
that
this
remuneration
proceeds
from
his
gratuitous
benevolence
they
are
equally
awkward
and
unhappy
in
their
use
of
the
trite
distinction
of
operating
and
coöperating
grace
augustine
has
used
it
indeed
but
softens
it
by
a
suitable
definition
that
god
in
coöperating
completes
what
in
operating
he
begins
and
that
it
is
the
same
grace
but
derives
its
name
from
the
different
mode
of
its
efficiency
whence
it
follows
that
he
makes
no
partition
of
the
work
between
god
and
us
as
though
there
were
a
mutual
concurrence
from
the
respective
exertions
of
each
but
that
he
only
designates
the
multiplication
of
grace
to
the
same
purpose
is
what
he
elsewhere
asserts
that
the
good
will
of
man
precedes
many
of
the
gifts
of
god
but
is
itself
one
of
their
number
whence
it
follows
that
he
leaves
nothing
for
it
to
arrogate
to
itself
this
is
also
particularly
expressed
by
paul
for
having
said
that
it
is
god
which
worketh
in
us
both
to
will
and
to
do
he
immediately
adds
that
he
does
both
of
his
own
good
pleasure
signifying
by
this
expression
that
these
are
acts
of
gratuitous
benignity
now
to
their
wonted
assertion
that
after
we
have
admitted
the
first
grace
our
own
endeavours
coöperate
with
the
grace
which
follows
i
reply
if
they
mean
that
after
having
been
once
subdued
by
the
divine
power
to
the
obedience
of
righteousness
we
voluntarily
advance
and
are
disposed
to
follow
the
guidance
of
grace
i
make
no
objection
for
it
is
very
certain
that
where
the
grace
of
god
reigns
there
is
such
a
promptitude
of
obedience
but
whence
does
this
arise
but
from
the
spirit
of
god
who
uniformly
consistent
with
himself
cherishes
and
strengthens
to
a
constancy
of
perseverance
that
disposition
of
obedience
which
he
first
originated
but
if
they
mean
that
man
derives
from
himself
an
ability
to
coöperate
with
the
grace
of
god
they
are
involved
in
a
most
pestilent
error
xii
and
to
this
purpose
they
falsely
and
ignorantly
pervert
that
observation
of
the
apostle
i
laboured
more
abundantly
than
they
all
yet
not
i
but
the
grace
of
god
which
was
with
for
they
understand
it
in
this
manner
that
because
his
preference
of
himself
to
all
others
might
appear
rather
too
arrogant
he
corrects
it
by
referring
the
praise
to
the
grace
of
god
but
yet
so
as
to
denominate
himself
a
coöperator
with
grace
it
is
surprising
that
so
many
men
not
otherwise
erroneous
have
stumbled
at
this
imaginary
difficulty
for
the
apostle
does
not
say
that
the
grace
of
god
laboured
with
him
to
make
himself
a
partner
in
the
labour
but
rather
by
that
correction
ascribes
the
whole
praise
of
the
labour
to
grace
alone
it
is
not
i
says
he
that
have
laboured
but
the
grace
of
god
which
was
with
they
have
been
deceived
by
an
ambiguity
of
expression
but
still
more
by
a
preposterous
translation
in
which
the
force
of
the
greek
article
is
omitted
for
if
you
translate
it
literally
he
says
not
that
grace
was
coöperative
with
him
but
that
the
grace
which
was
with
him
was
the
author
of
all
and
the
same
is
maintained
by
augustine
though
briefly
yet
without
obscurity
when
he
thus
expresses
himself
the
good
will
of
man
precedes
many
of
the
gifts
of
god
but
not
all
but
of
those
which
it
precedes
it
is
itself
then
follows
this
reason
because
it
is
written
the
god
of
my
mercy
shall
prevent
and
mercy
shall
follow
it
prevents
the
unwilling
that
he
may
will
it
follows
the
willing
that
he
may
not
will
in
vain
with
this
agrees
bernard
who
introduces
the
church
saying
draw
me
unwilling
to
make
me
willing
draw
me
inactive
to
make
me
xiii
now
let
us
hear
augustine
speak
in
his
own
words
lest
the
sophists
of
the
sorbonne
those
pelagians
of
the
present
age
according
to
their
usual
custom
accuse
us
of
opposing
the
whole
current
of
antiquity
in
this
they
imitate
their
father
pelagius
by
whom
augustine
was
formerly
obliged
to
enter
into
the
same
field
of
controversy
in
his
treatise
corr
et
addressed
to
valentine
he
treats
very
much
at
large
what
i
shall
recite
briefly
but
in
his
own
words
that
to
adam
was
given
the
grace
of
persevering
in
good
if
he
chose
that
grace
is
given
to
us
to
will
and
by
willing
to
overcome
concupiscence
that
adam
therefore
had
the
power
if
he
had
the
will
but
not
the
will
that
he
might
have
the
power
but
that
it
is
given
to
us
to
have
both
the
will
and
the
power
that
the
primitive
liberty
was
a
power
to
abstain
from
sin
but
that
ours
is
much
greater
being
an
inability
to
commit
and
lest
he
should
be
supposed
to
speak
of
the
perfection
to
be
enjoyed
after
the
attainment
of
a
state
of
immortality
as
lombard
misinterprets
his
meaning
he
presently
removes
this
difficulty
for
he
says
the
will
of
the
saints
is
so
inflamed
by
the
holy
spirit
that
they
therefore
have
an
ability
because
they
have
such
a
will
and
that
their
having
such
a
will
proceeds
from
the
operations
of
for
if
amidst
such
great
weakness
which
still
requires
strength
to
be
made
perfect
for
the
repressing
of
pride
they
were
left
to
their
own
will
so
as
to
have
ability
through
the
divine
assistance
if
they
were
willing
and
god
did
not
operate
in
them
to
produce
that
will
among
so
many
temptations
and
infirmities
their
will
would
fail
and
therefore
they
could
not
possibly
persevere
the
infirmity
of
the
human
will
then
is
succoured
that
it
may
be
invariably
and
inseparably
actuated
by
divine
grace
and
so
notwithstanding
all
its
weakness
may
not
fail
he
afterwards
discusses
more
at
large
how
our
hearts
necessarily
follow
the
impulse
of
god
and
he
asserts
that
the
lord
draws
men
with
their
own
wills
but
that
those
wills
are
such
as
he
himself
has
formed
now
we
have
a
testimony
from
the
mouth
of
augustine
to
the
point
which
we
are
principally
endeavouring
to
establish
that
grace
is
not
merely
offered
by
the
lord
to
be
either
received
or
rejected
according
to
the
free
choice
of
each
individual
but
that
it
is
grace
which
produces
both
the
choice
and
the
will
in
the
heart
so
that
every
subsequent
good
work
is
the
fruit
and
effect
of
it
and
that
it
is
obeyed
by
no
other
will
but
that
which
it
has
produced
for
this
is
his
language
also
in
another
it
is
grace
alone
which
performs
every
good
work
in
us
xiv
when
he
observes
that
the
will
is
not
taken
away
by
grace
but
only
changed
from
a
bad
one
into
a
good
one
and
when
it
is
good
assisted
he
only
intends
that
man
is
not
drawn
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
carried
away
by
an
external
impulse
without
any
inclination
of
his
mind
but
that
he
is
internally
so
disposed
as
to
obey
from
his
very
heart
that
grace
is
specially
and
gratuitously
given
to
the
elect
he
maintains
in
an
epistle
to
boniface
in
the
following
language
we
know
that
the
grace
of
god
is
not
given
to
all
men
and
that
to
them
to
whom
it
is
given
it
is
given
neither
according
to
the
merits
of
works
nor
according
to
the
merits
of
will
but
by
gratuitous
favour
and
to
those
to
whom
it
is
not
given
we
know
that
it
is
not
given
by
the
righteous
judgment
of
and
in
the
same
epistle
he
strenuously
combats
that
opinion
which
supposes
that
subsequent
grace
is
given
to
the
merits
of
men
because
by
not
rejecting
the
first
grace
they
showed
themselves
worthy
of
it
for
he
wishes
pelagius
to
allow
that
grace
is
necessary
to
us
for
every
one
of
our
actions
and
is
not
a
retribution
of
our
works
that
it
may
be
acknowledged
to
be
pure
grace
but
the
subject
can
not
be
comprised
in
a
more
concise
summary
than
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
his
treatise
addressed
to
valentine
where
he
teaches
that
the
human
will
obtains
not
grace
by
liberty
but
liberty
by
grace
that
being
impressed
by
the
same
grace
with
a
disposition
of
delight
it
is
formed
for
perpetuity
that
it
is
strengthened
with
invincible
fortitude
that
while
grace
reigns
it
never
falls
but
deserted
by
grace
falls
immediately
that
by
the
gratuitous
mercy
of
the
lord
it
is
converted
to
what
is
good
and
being
converted
perseveres
in
it
that
the
first
direction
of
the
human
will
to
that
which
is
good
and
its
subsequent
constancy
depend
solely
on
the
will
of
god
and
not
on
any
merit
of
man
thus
there
is
left
to
man
such
a
free
will
if
we
choose
to
give
it
that
appellation
as
he
describes
in
another
place
that
he
can
neither
be
converted
to
god
nor
continue
in
god
but
by
grace
and
that
all
the
ability
which
he
has
is
derived
from
grace
chapter
iv
the
operation
of
god
in
the
hearts
of
men
it
has
now
i
apprehend
been
sufficiently
proved
that
man
is
so
enslaved
by
sin
as
to
be
of
his
own
nature
incapable
of
an
effort
or
even
an
aspiration
towards
that
which
is
good
we
have
also
laid
down
a
distinction
between
coaction
and
necessity
from
which
it
appears
that
while
he
sins
necessarily
he
nevertheless
sins
voluntarily
but
since
while
he
is
devoted
to
the
servitude
of
the
devil
he
seems
to
be
actuated
by
his
will
rather
than
by
his
own
it
remains
for
us
to
explain
the
nature
of
both
kinds
of
influence
there
is
also
this
question
to
be
resolved
whether
any
thing
is
to
be
attributed
to
god
in
evil
actions
in
which
the
scripture
intimates
that
some
influence
of
his
is
concerned
augustine
somewhere
compares
the
human
will
to
a
horse
obedient
to
the
direction
of
his
rider
and
god
and
the
devil
he
compares
to
riders
if
god
rides
it
he
like
a
sober
and
skilful
rider
manages
it
in
a
graceful
manner
stimulates
its
tardiness
restrains
its
immoderate
celerity
represses
its
wantonness
and
wildness
tames
its
perverseness
and
conducts
it
into
the
right
way
but
if
the
devil
has
taken
possession
of
it
he
like
a
foolish
and
wanton
rider
forces
it
through
pathless
places
hurries
it
into
ditches
drives
it
down
over
precipices
and
excites
it
to
obstinacy
and
with
this
similitude
as
no
better
occurs
we
will
at
present
be
content
when
the
will
of
a
natural
man
is
said
to
be
subject
to
the
power
of
the
devil
so
as
to
be
directed
by
it
the
meaning
is
not
that
it
resists
and
is
compelled
to
a
reluctant
submission
as
masters
compel
slaves
to
an
unwilling
performance
of
their
commands
but
that
being
fascinated
by
the
fallacies
of
satan
it
necessarily
submits
itself
to
all
his
directions
for
those
whom
the
lord
does
not
favour
with
the
government
of
his
spirit
he
abandons
in
righteous
judgment
to
the
influence
of
satan
wherefore
the
apostle
says
that
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
who
are
destined
to
destruction
lest
the
light
of
the
gospel
should
shine
unto
and
in
another
place
that
he
worketh
in
the
children
of
the
blinding
of
the
wicked
and
all
those
enormities
which
attend
it
are
called
the
works
of
satan
the
cause
of
which
must
nevertheless
be
sought
only
in
the
human
will
from
which
proceeds
the
root
of
evil
and
in
which
rests
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
satan
that
is
sin
ii
very
different
in
such
instances
is
the
method
of
the
divine
operation
and
that
we
may
have
a
clearer
view
of
it
let
us
take
as
an
example
the
calamity
which
holy
job
suffered
from
the
chaldeans
the
chaldeans
massacred
his
shepherds
and
committed
hostile
depredations
on
his
flock
now
the
wickedness
of
their
procedure
is
evident
yet
in
these
transactions
satan
was
not
unconcerned
for
with
him
the
history
states
the
whole
affair
to
have
originated
but
job
himself
recognizes
in
it
the
work
of
the
lord
whom
he
asserts
to
have
taken
from
him
those
things
of
which
he
had
been
plundered
by
the
chaldeans
how
can
we
refer
the
same
action
to
god
to
satan
and
to
man
as
being
each
the
author
of
it
without
either
excusing
satan
by
associating
him
with
god
or
making
god
the
author
of
evil
very
easily
if
we
examine
first
the
end
for
which
the
action
was
designed
and
secondly
the
manner
in
which
it
was
effected
the
design
of
the
lord
is
to
exercise
the
patience
of
his
servant
by
adversity
satan
endeavours
to
drive
him
to
despair
the
chaldeans
in
defiance
of
law
and
justice
desire
to
enrich
themselves
by
the
property
of
another
so
great
a
diversity
of
design
makes
a
great
distinction
in
the
action
there
is
no
less
difference
in
the
manner
the
lord
permits
his
servant
to
be
afflicted
by
satan
the
chaldeans
whom
he
commissions
to
execute
his
purpose
he
permits
and
resigns
to
be
impelled
by
satan
satan
with
his
envenomed
stings
instigates
the
minds
of
the
chaldeans
otherwise
very
depraved
to
perpetrate
the
crime
they
furiously
rush
into
the
act
of
injustice
and
overwhelm
themselves
in
criminality
satan
therefore
is
properly
said
to
work
in
the
reprobate
in
whom
he
exercises
his
dominion
that
is
the
kingdom
of
iniquity
god
also
is
said
to
work
in
a
way
proper
to
himself
because
satan
being
the
instrument
of
his
wrath
turns
himself
hither
and
thither
at
his
appointment
and
command
to
execute
his
righteous
judgments
here
i
allude
not
to
the
universal
influence
of
god
by
which
all
creatures
are
sustained
and
from
which
they
derive
an
ability
to
perform
whatever
they
do
i
speak
only
of
that
special
influence
which
appears
in
every
particular
act
we
see
then
that
the
same
action
is
without
absurdity
ascribed
to
god
to
satan
and
to
man
but
the
variety
in
the
end
and
in
the
manner
causes
the
righteousness
of
god
to
shine
without
the
least
blemish
and
the
iniquity
of
satan
and
of
man
to
betray
itself
to
its
own
disgrace
iii
the
fathers
are
sometimes
too
scrupulous
on
this
subject
and
afraid
of
a
simple
confession
of
the
truth
lest
they
should
afford
an
occasion
to
impiety
to
speak
irreverently
and
reproachfully
of
the
works
of
god
though
i
highly
approve
this
sobriety
yet
i
think
we
are
in
no
danger
if
we
simply
maintain
what
the
scripture
delivers
even
augustine
at
one
time
was
not
free
from
this
scrupulosity
as
when
he
says
that
hardening
and
blinding
belong
not
to
the
operation
but
to
the
prescience
of
god
but
these
subtleties
are
inconsistent
with
numerous
expressions
of
the
scripture
which
evidently
import
some
intervention
of
god
beyond
mere
foreknowledge
and
augustine
himself
in
his
fifth
book
against
julian
contends
very
largely
that
sins
proceed
not
only
from
the
permission
or
the
prescience
but
from
the
power
of
god
in
order
that
former
sins
may
thereby
be
punished
so
also
what
they
advance
concerning
permission
is
too
weak
to
be
supported
god
is
very
frequently
said
to
blind
and
harden
the
reprobate
and
to
turn
incline
and
influence
their
hearts
as
i
have
elsewhere
more
fully
stated
but
it
affords
no
explication
of
the
nature
of
this
influence
to
resort
to
prescience
or
permission
we
answer
therefore
that
it
operates
in
two
ways
for
since
when
his
light
is
removed
nothing
remains
but
darkness
and
blindness
since
when
his
spirit
is
withdrawn
our
hearts
harden
into
stones
since
when
his
direction
ceases
they
are
warped
into
obliquity
he
is
properly
said
to
blind
harden
and
incline
those
whom
he
deprives
of
the
power
of
seeing
obeying
and
acting
aright
the
second
way
which
is
much
more
consistent
with
strict
propriety
of
language
is
when
for
the
execution
of
his
judgments
he
by
means
of
satan
the
minister
of
his
wrath
directs
their
counsels
to
what
he
pleases
and
excites
their
wills
and
strengthens
their
efforts
thus
when
moses
relates
that
sihon
the
king
would
not
grant
a
free
passage
to
the
people
because
god
had
hardened
his
spirit
and
made
his
heart
obstinate
he
immediately
subjoins
the
end
of
god
s
design
that
he
might
deliver
him
into
thy
since
god
willed
his
destruction
the
obduration
of
his
heart
therefore
was
the
divine
preparation
for
his
ruin
iv
the
following
expressions
seem
to
relate
to
the
former

removeth

speech
of
the
trusty
and
taketh
away
the
understanding
of
the
aged
he
taketh
away
the
heart
of
the
chief
people
of
the
earth
and
causeth
them
to
wander
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no

o
lord
why
hast
thou
made
us
to
err
from
thy
ways
and
hardened
our
heart
from
thy
fear
for
these
passages
rather
indicate
what
god
makes
men
by
deserting
them
than
show
how
he
performs
his
operations
within
them
but
there
are
other
testimonies
which
go
further
as
those
which
relate
to
the
hardening
of
pharaoh
i
will
harden
his
pharaoh
s
heart
that
he
shall
not
let
the
people
afterwards
the
lord
says
i
have
hardened
his
did
he
harden
it
by
not
mollifying
it
that
is
true
but
he
did
somewhat
more
for
he
delivered
his
heart
to
satan
to
be
confirmed
in
obstinacy
whence
he
had
before
said
i
will
harden
his
the
people
march
out
of
egypt
the
inhabitants
of
the
country

them
in
a
hostile
manner
by
whom
were
they
excited
moses
expressly
declared
to
the
people
that
it
was
the
lord
who
had
hardened
their
hearts
the
psalmist
reciting
the
same
history
says
he
turned
their
heart
to
hate
his
now
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
fell
in
consequence
of
being
deprived
of
the
counsel
of
god
for
if
they
are
hardened
and
turned
they
are
positively
inclined
to
that
point
besides
whenever
it
has
pleased
him
to
punish
the
transgressions
of
his
people
how
has
he
executed
his
work
by
means
of
the
reprobate
in
such
a
manner
that
any
one
may
see
that
the
efficacy
of
the
action
proceeded
from
him
and
that
they
were
only
the
ministers
of
his
will
wherefore
he
threatened
sometimes
that
he
would
call
them
forth
by
hissing
sometimes
that
he
would
use
them
as
a
net
to
entangle
sometimes
as
a
hammer
to
strike
the
people
of
israel
but
he
particularly
declared
himself
to
be
operative
in
them
when
he
called
sennacherib

axe
which
was
both
directed
and
driven
by
his
hand
augustine
somewhere
makes
the
following
correct
distinction
that
they
sin
proceeds
from
themselves
that
in
sinning
they
perform
this
or
that
particular
action
is
from
the
power
of
god
who
divides
the
darkness
according
to
his
now
that
the
ministry
of
satan
is
concerned
in
instigating
the
reprobate
whenever
the
lord
directs
them
hither
or
thither
by
his
providence
may
be
sufficiently
proved
even
from
one
passage
for
it
is
frequently
asserted
in
samuel
that
an
evil
spirit
of
the
lord
and
an
evil
spirit
from
the
lord
either
agitated
or
quitted
saul
to
refer
this
to
the
holy
spirit
were
impious
an
impure
spirit
therefore
is
called
a
spirit
of
god
because
it
acts
according
to
his
command
and
by
his
power
being
rather
an
instrument
in
the
performance
of
the
action
than
itself
the
author
of
it
we
must
add
also
what
is
advanced
by
paul
that
god
shall
send
strong
delusion
that
they
who
believed
not
the
truth
should
believe
a
yet
there
is
always
a
wide
difference
even
in
the
same
work
between
the
operation
of
god
and
the
attempts
of
satan
and
wicked
men
he
makes
the
evil
instruments
which
he
has
in
his
hand
and
can
turn
as
he
pleases
to
be
subservient
to
his
justice
they
as
they
are
evil
produce
the
iniquity
which
the
depravity
of
their
nature
has
conceived
the
other
arguments
which
tend
to
vindicate
the
majesty
of
god
from
every
calumny
and
to
obviate
the
cavils
of
the
impious
have
already
been
advanced
in
the
chapter
concerning
providence
for
at
present
i
only
intend
briefly
to
show
how
satan
reigns
in
the
reprobate
man
and
how
the
lord
operates
in
them
both
vi
but
what
liberty
man
possesses
in
those
actions
which
in
themselves
are
neither
righteous
nor
wicked
and
pertain
rather
to
the
corporeal
than
to
the
spiritual
life
although
we
have
before
hinted
has
not
yet
been
explicitly
stated
some
have
admitted
him
in
such
things
to
possess
a
free
choice
rather
as
i
suppose
from
a
reluctance
to
dispute
on
a
subject
of
no
importance
than
from
an
intention
of
positively
asserting
that
which
they
concede
now
though
i
grant
that
they
who
believe
themselves
to
be
possessed
of
no
power
to
justify
themselves
believe
what
is
principally
necessary
to
be
known
in
order
to
salvation
yet
i
think
that
this
point
also
should
not
be
neglected
that
we
may
know
it
to
be
owing
to
the
special
favour
of
god
whenever
our
mind
is
disposed
to
choose
that
which
is
advantageous
for
us
whenever
our
will
inclines
to
it
and
on
the
other
hand
whenever
our
mind
and
understanding
avoid
what
would
otherwise
hurt
us
and
the
power
of
the
providence
of
god
extends
so
far
as
not
only
to
cause
those
events
to
succeed
which
he
foresees
will
be
best
but
also
to
incline
the
wills
of
men
to
the
same
objects
indeed
if
we
view
the
administration
of
external
things
with
our
own
reason
we
shall
not
doubt
their
subjection
to
the
human
will
but
if
we
listen
to
the
numerous
testimonies
which
proclaim
that
in
these
things
also
the
hearts
of
men
are
governed
by
the
lord
they
will
constrain
us
to
submit
the
will
itself
to
the
special
influence
of
god
who
conciliated
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
towards
the
israelites
so
as
to
induce
them
to
lend
them
the
most
valuable
of
their
furniture
they
would
never
have
been
induced
to
do
this
of
their
own
accord
it
follows
therefore
that
their
hearts
were
guided
by
the
lord
rather
than
by
an
inclination
of
their
own
and
jacob
if
he
had
not
been
persuaded
that
god
infuses
various
dispositions
into
men
according
to
his
pleasure
would
not
have
said
concerning
his
son
joseph
whom
he
thought
to
be
some
profane
egyptian
god
almighty
give
you
mercy
before
the
as
the
whole
church
confesses
in
the
psalms
that
when
god
chose
to
compassionate
her
he
softened
the
hearts
of
the
cruel
nations
into
clemency
again
when
saul
was
so
inflamed
with
rage
as
to
prepare
himself
for
war
it
is
expressly
mentioned
as
the
cause
that
he
was
impelled
by
the
spirit
of
god
who
diverted
the
mind
of
absalom
from
adopting
the
counsel
of
ahithophel
which
used
to
be
esteemed
as
an
oracle
who
inclined
rehoboam
to
be
persuaded
by
the
counsel
of
the
young
men
who
caused
the
nations
that
before
were
very
valiant
to
feel
terror
at
the
approach
of
the
israelites
rahab
the
harlot
confessed
that
this
was
the
work
of
god
who
on
the
other
hand
dejected
the
minds
of
the
israelites
with
fear
and
terror
but
he
who
had
threatened
in
the
law
that
he
would
send
a
faintness
into
their
hearts
vii
some
one
will
object
that
these
are
peculiar
examples
to
the
rule
of
which
things
ought
by
no
means
universally
to
be
reduced
but
i
maintain
that
they
are
sufficient
to
prove
that
for
which
i
contend
that
god
whenever
he
designs
to
prepare
the
way
for
his
providence
inclines
and
moves
the
wills
of
men
even
in
external
things
and
that
their
choice
is
not
so
free
but
that
its
liberty
is
subject
to
the
will
of
god
that
your
mind
depends
more
on
the
influence
of
god
than
on
the
liberty
of
your
own
choice
you
must
be
constrained
to
conclude
whether
you
are
willing
or
not
from
this
daily
experience
that
in
affairs
of
no
perplexity
your
judgment
and
understanding
frequently
fail
that
in
undertakings
not
arduous
your
spirits
languish
on
the
other
hand
in
things
the
most
obscure
suitable
advice
is
immediately
offered
in
things
great
and
perilous
your
mind
proves
superior
to
every
difficulty
and
thus
i
explain
the
observation
of
solomon
the
hearing
ear
and
the
seeing
eye
the
lord
hath
made
even
both
of
for
he
appears
to
me
to
speak
not
of
their
creation
but
of
the
peculiar
favour
of
god
displayed
in
their
performing
their
functions
when
he
says
that
the
king
s
heart
is
in
the
hand
of
the
lord
as
the
rivers
of
water
he
turneth
it
whithersoever
he
will
under
one
species
he
clearly
comprehends
the
whole
genus
for
if
the
will
of
any
man
be
free
from
all
subjection
that
privilege
belongs
eminently
to
the
will
of
a
king
which
exercises
a
government
in
some
measure
over
the
wills
of
others
but
if
the
will
of
the
king
be
subject
to
the
power
of
god
ours
can
not
be
exempted
from
the
same
authority
augustine
has
a
remarkable
passage
on
this
subject
the
scripture
if
it
be
diligently
examined
shows
not
only
that
the
good
wills
of
men
which
he
turns
from
evil
into
good
and
directs
to
good
actions
and
to
eternal
life
but
also
that
those
wills
which
relate
to
the
present
life
are
subject
to
the
power
of
god
so
that
he
by
a
most
secret
but
yet
a
most
righteous
judgment
causes
them
to
be
inclined
whither
he
pleases
and
when
he
pleases
either
for
the
communication
of
benefits
or
for
the
infliction
of
viii
here
let
the
reader
remember
that
the
ability
of
the
human
will
is
not
to
be
estimated
from
the
event
of
things
as
some
ignorant
men
are
preposterously
accustomed
to
do
for
they
conceive
themselves
fully
and
ingeniously
to
establish
the
servitude
of
the
human
will
because
even
the
most
exalted
monarchs
have
not
all
their
desires
fulfilled
but
this
ability
of
which
we
speak
is
to
be
considered
within
man
and
not
to
be
measured
by
external
success
for
in
the
dispute
concerning
free
will
the
question
is
not
whether
a
man
notwithstanding
external
impediments
can
perform
and
execute
whatever
he
may
have
resolved
in
his
mind
but
whether
in
every
case
his
judgment
exerts
freedom
of
choice
and
his
will
freedom
of
inclination
if
men
possess
both
these
then
attilius
regulus
when
confined
to
the
small
extent
of
a
cask
stuck
round
with
nails
will
possess
as
much
free
will
as
augustus
cæsar
when
governing
a
great
part
of
the
world
with
his
nod
chapter
a
refutation
of
the
objections
commonly
urged
in
support
of
free
will
enough
might
appear
to
have
been
already
said
on
the
servitude
of
the
human
will
did
not
they
who
endeavour
to
overthrow
it
with
a
false
notion
of
liberty
allege
on
the
contrary
certain
reasons
in
opposition
to
our
sentiments
first
they
collect
together
some
absurdities
in
order
to
render
it
odious
as
if
it
were
abhorrent
to
common
sense
and
then
they
attack
it
with
testimonies
of
scripture
both
these
weapons
we
will
repel
in
order
if
sin
say
they
be
necessary
then
it
ceases
to
be
sin
if
it
be
voluntary
then
it
may
be
avoided
these
were
also
the
weapons
used
by
pelagius
in
his
attacks
on
augustine
with
whose
authority
however
we
wish
not
to
urge
them
till
we
shall
have
given
some
satisfaction
on
the
subject
itself
i
deny
then
that
sin
is
the
less
criminal
because
it
is
necessary
i
deny
also
the
other
consequence
which
they
infer
that
it
is
avoidable
because
it
is
voluntary
for
if
any
one
wish
to
dispute
with
god
and
to
escape
his
judgment
by
the
pretext
of
having
been
incapable
of
acting
otherwise
he
is
prepared
with
an
answer
which
we
have
elsewhere
advanced
that
it
arises
not
from
creation
but
from
the
corruption
of
nature
that
men
being
enslaved
by
sin
can
will
nothing
but
what
is
evil
for
whence
proceeded
that
impotence
of
which
the
ungodly
would
gladly
avail
themselves
but
from
adam
voluntarily
devoting
himself
to
the
tyranny
of
the
devil
hence
therefore
the
corruption
with
which
we
are
firmly
bound
it
originated
in
the
revolt
of
the
first
man
from
his
maker
if
all
men
are
justly
accounted
guilty
of
this
rebellion
let
them
not
suppose
themselves
excused
by
necessity
in
which
very
thing
they
have
a
most
evident
cause
of
their
condemnation
and
this
i
have
before
clearly
explained
and
have
given
an
example
in
the
devil
himself
which
shows
that
he
who
sins
necessarily
sins
no
less
voluntarily
and
also
in
the
elect
angels
whose
will
though
it
can
not
swerve
from
what
is
good
ceases
not
to
be
a
will
bernard
also
judiciously
inculcates
the
same
doctrine
that
we
are
therefore
the
more
miserable
because
our
necessity
is
voluntary
which
yet
constrains
us
to
be
so
devoted
to
it
that
we
are
as
we
have
already
observed
the
slaves
of
sin
the
second
branch
of
their
argument
is
erroneous
because
it
makes
an
improper
transition
from
what
is
voluntary
to
what
is
free
but
we
have
before
evinced
that
a
thing
may
be
done
voluntarily
which
yet
is
not
the
subject
of
free
choice
ii
they
add
that
unless
both
virtues
and
vices
proceed
from
the
free
choice
of
the
will
it
is
not
reasonable
either
that
punishments
should
be
inflicted
or
that
rewards
should
be
conferred
on
man
this
argument
though
first
advanced
by
aristotle
yet
i
grant
is
used
on
some
occasions
by
chrysostom
and
jerome
that
it
was
familiar
to
the
pelagians
however
jerome
himself
does
not
dissemble
but
even
relates
their
own
words
if
the
grace
of
god
operates
in
us
then
the
crown
will
be
given
to
grace
not
to
us
who
in
regard
to
punishments
i
reply
that
they
are
justly
inflicted
on
us
from
whom
the
guilt
of
sin
proceeds
for
of
what
importance
is
it
whether
sin
be
committed
with
a
judgment
free
or
enslaved
so
it
be
committed
with
the
voluntary
bias
of
the
passions
especially
as
man
is
proved
to
be
a
sinner
because
he
is
subject
to
the
servitude
of
sin
with
respect
to
rewards
of
righteousness
where
is
the
great
absurdity
if
we
confess
that
they
depend
rather
on
the
divine
benignity
than
on
our
own
merits
how
often
does
this
recur
in
augustine
that
god
crowns
not
our
merits
but
his
own
gifts
and
that
they
are
called
rewards
not
as
though
they
were
due
to
our
merits
but
because
they
are
retributions
to
the
graces
already
conferred
on
us
they
discover
great
acuteness
in
this
observation
that
there
remains
no
room
for
merits
if
they
originate
not
from
free
will
but
in
their
opinion
of
the
erroneousness
of
our
sentiment
they
are
greatly
mistaken
for
augustine
hesitates
not
on
all
occasions
to
inculcate
as
certain
what
they
think
it
impious
to
acknowledge
as
where
he
says
what
are
the
merits
of
any
man
when
he
comes
not
with
a
merited
reward
but
with
free
grace
he
alone
being
free
and
a
deliverer
from
sins
finds
all
men
again
if
you
receive
what
is
your
due
you
must
be
punished
what
then
is
done
god
has
given
you
not
merited
punishment
but
unmerited
grace
if
you
wish
to
be
excluded
from
grace
boast
your
again
you
are
nothing
of
yourself
sins
are
yours
merits
belong
to
god
you
deserve
punishment
and
when
you
come
to
be
rewarded
he
will
crown
his
own
gifts
not
your
in
the
same
sense
he
elsewhere
teaches
that
grace
proceeds
not
from
merit
but
merit
from
grace
and
a
little
after
he
concludes
that
god
with
his
gifts
precedes
all
merits
that
thence
he
may
elicit
his
other
merits
and
gives
altogether
freely
because
he
discovers
nothing
as
a
cause
of
salvation
but
what
necessity
is
there
for
further
quotations
when
his
writings
are
full
of
such
passages
but
the
apostle
will
even
better
deliver
them
from
this
error
if
they
will
hear
from
what
origin
he
deduces
the
glory
of
the
saints
whom
he
did
predestinate
them
he
also
called
and
whom
he
called
them
he
also
justified
and
whom
he
justified
them
he
also
why
then
according
to
the
apostle
are
the
faithful
crowned
because
by
the
mercy
of
the
lord
and
not
by
their
own
industry
they
are
elected
and
called
and
justified
farewell
then
this
vain
fear
that
there
will
be
an
end
of
all
merits
if
free
will
be
overturned
for
it
is
a
proof
of
extreme
folly
to
be
terrified
and
to
fly
from
that
to
which
the
scripture
calls
us
if
says
he
thou
didst
receive
it
why
dost
thou
glory
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
it
you
see
that
he
divests
free
will
of
every
thing
with
the
express
design
of
leaving
no
room
for
merits
but
yet
the
beneficence
and
liberality
of
god
being
inexhaustible
and
various
those
graces
which
he
confers
on
us
because
he
makes
them
ours
he
rewards
just
as
if
they
were
our
own
virtues
iii
they
further
allege
what
may
appear
to
be
borrowed
from
chrysostom
that
if
our
will
has
not
this
ability
to
choose
good
or
evil
the
partakers
of
the
same
nature
must
be
either
all
evil
or
all
good
and
not
very
far
from
this
is
the
writer
whoever
he
was
of
the
treatise
the
calling
of
the
which
is
circulated
under
the
name
of
ambrose
when
he
argues
that
no
man
would
ever
recede
from
the
faith
unless
the
grace
of
god
left
us
the
condition
of
mutability
in
which
it
is
surprising
that
such
great
men
were
so
inconsistent
with
themselves
for
how
did
it
not
occur
to
chrysostom
that
it
is
the
election
of
god
which
makes
this
difference
between
men
we
are
not
afraid
to
allow
what
paul
very
strenuously
asserts
that
all
without
exception
are
depraved
and
addicted
to
wickedness
but
with
him
we
add
that
the
mercy
of
god
does
not
permit
all
to
remain
in
depravity
therefore
since
we
all
naturally
labour
under
the
same
disease
they
alone
recover
to
whom
the
lord
has
been
pleased
to
apply
his
healing
hand
the
rest
whom
he
passes
by
in
righteous
judgment
putrefy
in
their
corruption
till
they
are
entirely
consumed
and
it
is
from
the
same
cause
that
some
persevere
to
the
end
and
others
decline
and
fall
in
the
midst
of
their
course
for
perseverance
itself
also
is
a
gift
of
god
which
he
bestows
not
on
all
men
promiscuously
but
imparts
to
whom
he
pleases
if
we
inquire
the
cause
of
the
difference
why
some
persevere
with
constancy
and
others
fail
through
instability
no
other
can
be
found
but
that
god
sustains
the
former
by
his
power
that
they
perish
not
and
does
not
communicate
the
same
strength
to
the
latter
that
they
may
be
examples
of
inconstancy
iv
they
urge
further
that
exhortations
are
given
in
vain
that
the
use
of
admonitions
is
superfluous
and
that
reproofs
are
ridiculous
if
it
be
not
in
the
power
of
the
sinner
to
obey
when
similar
objections
were
formerly
made
to
augustine
he
was
obliged
to
write
his
treatise
correction
and
in
which
though
he
copiously
refutes
them
he
calls
his
adversaries
to
this
conclusion
o
man
in
the
commandment
learn
what
is
your
duty
in
correction
learn
that
through
your
own
fault
you
have
it
not
in
prayer
learn
whence
you
may
receive
what
you
wish
to
there
is
nearly
the
same
argument
in
the
treatise
the
spirit
and
in
which
he
maintains
that
god
does
not
regulate
the
precepts
of
his
law
by
the
ability
of
men
but
when
he
has
commanded
what
is
right
freely
gives
to
his
elect
ability
to
perform
it
this
is
not
a
subject
that
requires
a
prolix
discussion
first
we
are
not
alone
in
this
cause
but
have
the
support
of
christ
and
all
the
apostles
let
our
opponents
consider
how
they
can
obtain
the
superiority
in
a
contest
with
such
antagonists
does
christ
who
declares
that
without
him
we
can
do
nothing
on
that
account
the
less
reprehend
and
punish
those
who
without
him
do
what
is
evil
does
he
therefore
relax
in
his
exhortations
to
every
man
to
practise
good
works
how
severely
does
paul
censure
the
corinthians
for
their
neglect
of
charity
yet
he
earnestly
prays
that
charity
may
be
given
them
by
the
lord
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
he
declares
that
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
god
that
showeth
mercy
yet
afterwards
he
refrains
not
from
the
use
of
admonition
exhortation
and
reproof
why
do
they
not
therefore
remonstrate
with
the
lord
not
to
lose
his
labour
in
such
a
manner
by
requiring
of
men
those
things
which
he
alone
can
bestow
and
punishing
those
things
which
are
committed
for
want
of
his
grace
why
do
they
not
admonish
paul
to
spare
those
who
are
unable
to
will
or
run
without
the
previous
mercy
of
god
of
which
they
are
now
destitute
as
though
truly
the
lord
has
not
the
best
reason
for
his
doctrine
which
readily
presents
itself
to
those
who
religiously
seek
it
paul
clearly
shows
how
far
doctrine
exhortation
and
reproof
can
of
themselves
avail
towards
producing
a
change
of
heart
when
he
says
that
neither
is
he
that
planteth
any
thing
neither
he
that
watereth
but
that
the
efficacy
is
solely
from
god
that
giveth
the
thus
we
see
that
moses
severely
sanctions
the
precepts
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
earnestly
urge
and
threaten
transgressors
whilst
nevertheless
they
acknowledge
that
men
never
begin
to
be
wise
till
a
heart
is
given
them
to
understand
that
it
is
the
peculiar
work
of
god
to
circumcise
the
heart
and
instead
of
a
stony
heart
to
give
a
heart
of
flesh
to
inscribe
his
law
in
men
s
minds
in
a
word
to
render
his
doctrine
effectual
by
a
renovation
of
the
soul
what
then
it
will
be
inquired
is
the
use
of
exhortations
i
reply
if
the
impious
despise
them
with
obstinate
hearts
they
will
serve
for
a
testimony
against
them
when
they
shall
come
to
the
tribunal
of
the
lord
and
even
in
the
present
state
they
wound
their
consciences
for
however
the
most
audacious
person
may
deride
them
he
can
not
disapprove
of
them
in
his
heart
but
it
will
be
said
what
can
a
miserable
sinner
do
if
the
softness
of
heart
which
is
necessary
to
obedience
be
denied
him
i
ask
what
excuse
can
he
plead
seeing
that
he
can
not
impute
the
hardness
of
his
heart
to
any
one
but
himself
the
impious
therefore
who
are
ready
if
possible
to
ridicule
the
divine
precepts
and
exhortations
are
in
spite
of
their
own
inclinations
confounded
by
their
power
but
the
principal
utility
should
be
considered
in
regard
to
the
faithful
in
whom
as
the
lord
performs
all
things
by
his
spirit
so
he
neglects
not
the
instrumentality
of
his
word
but
uses
it
with
great
efficacy
let
it
be
allowed
then
as
it
ought
to
be
that
all
the
strength
of
the
pious
consists
in
the
grace
of
god
according
to
this
expression
of
the
prophet
i
will
give
them
a
new
heart
that
they
may
walk
in
my
but
you
will
object
why
are
they
admonished
of
their
duty
and
not
rather
left
to
the
direction
of
the
spirit
why
are
they
importuned
with
exhortations
when
they
can
not
make
more
haste
than
is
produced
by
the
impulse
of
the
spirit
why
are
they
chastised
if
they
have
ever
deviated
from
the
right
way
seeing
that
they
erred
through
the
necessary
infirmity
of
the
flesh
i
reply
who
art
thou
o
man
that
wouldest
impose
laws
upon
god
if
it
be
his
will
to
prepare
us
by
exhortation
for
the
reception
of
this
grace
by
which
obedience
to
the
exhortation
is
produced
what
have
you
to
censure
in
this
economy
if
exhortations
and
reproofs
were
of
no
other
advantage
to
the
pious
than
to
convince
them
of
sin
they
ought
not
on
that
account
to
be
esteemed
wholly
useless
now
since
by
the
internal
operation
of
the
spirit
they
are
most
effectual
to
inflame
the
heart
with
a
love
of
righteousness
to
shake
off
sloth
to
destroy
the
pleasure
and
poisonous
sweetness
of
iniquity
and
on
the
contrary
to
render
it
hateful
and
burdensome
who
can
dare
to
reject
them
as
superfluous
if
any
one
would
desire
a
plainer
answer
let
him
take
it
thus
the
operations
of
god
on
his
elect
are
by
his
spirit
externally
by
his
word
by
his
spirit
illuminating
their
minds
and
forming
their
hearts
to
the
love
and
cultivation
of
righteousness
he
makes
them
new
creatures
by
his
word
he
excites
them
to
desire
seek
and
obtain
the
same
renovation
in
both
he
displays
the
efficacy
of
his
power
according
to
the
mode
of
his
dispensation
when
he
addresses
the
same
word
to
the
reprobate
though
it
produces
not
their
correction
yet
he
makes
it
effectual
for
another
purpose
that
they
may
be
confounded
by
the
testimony
of
their
consciences
now
and
be
rendered
more
inexcusable
at
the
day
of
judgment
thus
christ
though
he
pronounces
that
no
man
can
come
to
him
except
the
father
draw
him
and
that
the
elect
come
when
they
have
heard
and
learned
of
the
father
yet
himself
neglects
not
the
office
of
a
teacher
but
with
his
own
mouth
sedulously
invites
those
who
need
the
internal
teachings
of
the
holy
spirit
to
enable
them
to
derive
any
benefit
from
his
instructions
with
respect
to
the
reprobate
paul
suggests
that
teaching
is
not
useless
because
it
is
to
them
the
savour
of
death
unto
death
but
a
sweet
savour
unto
vi
our
adversaries
are
very
laborious
in
collecting
testimonies
of
scripture
and
this
with
a
view
since
they
can
not
refute
us
with
their
weight
to
overwhelm
us
with
their
number
but
as
in
battles
when
armies
come
to
close
combat
the
weak
multitude
whatever
pomp
and
ostentation
they
may
display
are
soon
defeated
and
routed
so
it
will
be
very
easy
for
us
to
vanquish
them
with
all
their
multitude
for
as
all
the
passages
which
they
abuse
in
their
opposition
to
us
when
properly
classed
and
distributed
centre
in
a
very
few
topics
one
answer
will
be
sufficient
for
many
of
them
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
dwell
on
a
particular
explication
of
each
their
principal
argument
they
derive
from
the
precepts
which
they
suppose
to
be
so
proportioned
to
our
ability
that
whatever
they
can
be
proved
to
require
it
necessarily
follows
we
are
capable
of
performing
they
proceed
therefore
to
a
particular
detail
of
them
and
by
them
measure
the
extent
of
our
strength
either
say
they
god
mocks
us
when
he
commands
holiness
piety
obedience
chastity
love
and
meekness
and
when
he
forbids
impurity
idolatry
unchastity
anger
robbery
pride
and
the
like
or
he
requires
only
such
things
as
we
have
power
to
perform
now
almost
all
the
precepts
which
they
collect
may
be
distributed
into
three
classes
some
require
the
first
conversion
to
god
others
simply
relate
to
the
observation
of
the
law
others
enjoin
perseverance
in
the
grace
of
god
already
received
let
us
first
speak
of
them
all
in
general
and
then
proceed
to
the
particulars
to
represent
the
ability
of
man
as
coëxtensive
with
the
precepts
of
the
divine
law
has
indeed
for
a
long
time
not
been
unusual
and
has
some
appearance
of
plausibility
but
it
has
proceeded
from
the
grossest
ignorance
of
the
law
for
those
who
think
it
an
enormous
crime
to
say
that
the
observation
of
the
law
is
impossible
insist
on
this
very
cogent
argument
that
otherwise
the
law
was
given
in
vain
for
they
argue
just
as
if
paul
had
never
said
any
thing
concerning
the
law
but
pray
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
the
law
was
added
because
of
transgressions
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
sin
the
law
worketh
wrath
the
law
entered
that
the
offence
might
abound
do
they
imply
a
necessity
of
its
being
limited
to
our
ability
that
it
might
not
be
given
in
vain
do
they
not
rather
show
that
it
was
placed
far
beyond
our
ability
in
order
to
convince
us
of
our
impotence
according
to
the
definition
of
the
same
apostle
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
but
when
he
wishes
the
minds
of
the
thessalonians
to
abound
in
love
he
plainly
acknowledges
that
the
law
sounds
in
our
ears
in
vain
unless
god
inspire
the
principles
of
it
into
our
hearts
vii
indeed
if
the
scripture
taught
only
that
the
law
is
the
rule
of
life
to
which
our
conduct
ought
to
be
conformed
i
would
immediately
accede
to
their
opinion
but
since
it
carefully
and
perspicuously
states
to
us
various
uses
of
the
law
it
will
be
best
to
consider
the
operation
of
the
law
in
man
according
to
that
exposition
as
far
as
relates
to
the
present
argument
when
it
has
prescribed
any
thing
to
be
performed
by
us
it
teaches
that
the
power
of
obedience
proceeds
from
the
goodness
of
god
and
therefore
invites
us
to
pray
that
it
may
be
given
us
if
there
were
only
a
commandment
and
no
promise
there
would
be
a
trial
of
the
sufficiency
of
our
strength
to
obey
the
commandment
but
since
the
commands
are
connected
with
promises
which
declare
that
we
must
derive
not
only
subsidiary
power
but
our
whole
strength
from
the
assistance
of
divine
grace
they
furnish
abundant
evidence
that
we
are
not
only
unequal
to
the
observation
of
the
law
but
altogether
incapable
of
it
wherefore
let
them
no
more
urge
the
proportion
of
our
ability
to
the
precepts
of
the
law
as
though
the
lord
had
regulated
the
standard
of
righteousness
which
he
designed
to
give
in
the
law
according
to
the
measure
of
our
imbecility
it
should
rather
be
concluded
from
the
promises
how
unprepared
we
are
of
ourselves
since
we
stand
in
such
universal
need
of
his
grace
but
will
it
say
they
be
credited
by
any
that
the
lord
addressed
his
law
to
stocks
and
stones
i
reply
that
no
one
will
attempt
to
inculcate
such
a
notion
for
neither
are
the
impious
stocks
or
stones
when
they
are
taught
by
the
law
the
contrariety
of
their
dispositions
to
god
and
are
convicted
of
guilt
by
the
testimony
of
their
own
minds
nor
the
pious
when
admonished
of
their
own
impotence
they
have
recourse
to
the
grace
of
god
to
this
purpose
are
the
following
passages
from
augustine
god
gives
commands
which
we
can
not
perform
that
we
may
know
what
we
ought
to
request
of
him
the
utility
of
the
precepts
is
great
if
only
so
much
be
given
to
free
will
that
the
grace
of
god
may
receive
the
greater
honour
faith
obtains
what
the
law
commands
and
the
law
therefore
commands
that
faith
may
obtain
that
which
is
commanded
by
the
law
moreover
god
requires
faith
itself
of
us
and
finds
not
what
he
requires
unless
he
has
given
what
he
again
let
god
give
what
he
enjoins
and
let
him
enjoin
what
he
viii
this
will
more
clearly
appear
in
an
examination
of
the
three
kinds
of
precepts
which
we
have
already
mentioned
the
lord
both
in
the
law
and
in
the
prophets
frequently
commands
us
to
be
converted
to
him
but
the
prophet
on
the
other
hand
says
turn
thou
me
and
i
shall
be
after
that
i
was
turned
i
repented
he
commands
us
to
circumcise
our
hearts
but
he
announces
by
moses
that
this
circumcision
is
the
work
of
his
own
hand
he
frequently
requires
newness
of
heart
but
elsewhere
declares
that
this
is
his
own
gift
what
god
promises
augustine
says
we
do
not
perform
ourselves
through
free
will
or
nature
but
he
does
it
himself
by
his
and
this
is
the
observation
to
which
he
himself
assigns
the
fifth
place
in
his
enumeration
of
ticonius
s
rules
of
christian
doctrine
that
we
should
make
a
proper
distinction
between
the
law
and
the
promises
or
between
the
commandments
and
grace
this
may
suffice
in
answer
to
those
who
from
the
precepts
infer
an
ability
in
man
to
obey
them
that
they
may
destroy
the
grace
of
god
by
which
those
very
precepts
are
fulfilled
the
precepts
of
the
second
class
are
simple
enjoining
on
us
the
worship
of
god
constant
submission
to
his
will
observance
of
his
commands
and
adherence
to
his
doctrine
but
there
are
innumerable
passages
which
prove
that
the
highest
degree
of
righteousness
sanctity
piety
and
purity
capable
of
being
attained
is
his
own
gift
of
the
third
class
is
that
exhortation
of
paul
and
barnabas
to
the
faithful
mentioned
by
luke
to
continue
in
the
grace
of
but
whence
the
grace
of
perseverance
should
be
sought
the
same
apostle
informs
us
when
he
says
finally
my
brethren
be
strong
in
the
in
another
place
he
cautions
us
to
grieve
not
the
holy
spirit
of
god
whereby
we
are
sealed
unto
the
day
of
but
because
what
he
there
requires
could
not
be
performed
by
men
he
prays
for
the
thessalonians
that
our
god
would
count
them
worthy
of
this
calling
and
fulfil
all
the
good
pleasure
of
his
goodness
and
the
work
of
faith
with
thus
also
in
the
second
epistle
to
the
corinthians
treating
of
alms
he
frequently
commends
their
benevolent
and
pious
disposition
yet
a
little
after
he
gives
thanks
to
god
for
having
inclined
the
heart
of
titus
to
accept
or
undertake
the
if
titus
could
not
even
use
his
own
tongue
to
exhort
others
without
having
been
prompted
by
god
how
should
others
have
been
inclined
to
act
unless
god
himself
had
directed
their
hearts
ix
our
more
subtle
adversaries
cavil
at
all
these
testimonies
because
there
is
no
impediment
they
say
that
prevents
our
exerting
our
own
ability
and
god
assisting
our
weak
efforts
they
adduce
also
passages
from
the
prophets
where
the
accomplishment
of
our
conversion
seems
to
be
divided
equally
between
god
and
us
turn
ye
unto
me
and
i
will
turn
unto
what
assistance
we
receive
from
the
lord
has
already
been
shown
and
needs
not
to
be
repeated
here
i
wish
only
this
single
point
to
be
conceded
to
me
that
it
is
in
vain
to
infer
our
possession
of
ability
to
fulfil
the
law
from
god
s
command
to
us
to
obey
it
since
it
is
evident
that
for
the
performance
of
all
the
divine
precepts
the
grace
of
the
legislator
is
both
necessary
for
us
and
promised
to
us
and
hence
it
follows
that
at
least
more
is
required
of
us
than
we
are
capable
of
performing
nor
is
it
possible
for
any
cavils
to
explain
away
that
passage
of
jeremiah
which
assures
us
that
the
covenant
of
god
made
with
his
ancient
people
was
frustrated
because
it
was
merely
a
literal
one
and
that
it
can
only
be
confirmed
by
the
influence
of
the
spirit
who
forms
the
heart
to
obedience
nor
does
their
error
derive
any
support
from
this
passage
turn
ye
unto
me
and
i
will
turn
unto
for
this
denotes
not
that
turning
of
god
in
which
he
renovates
our
hearts
to
repentance
but
that
in
which
he
declares
his
benevolence
and
kindness
by
external
prosperity
as
by
adversity
he
sometimes
manifests
his
displeasure
when
the
people
of
israel
therefore
after
having
been
harassed
with
miseries
and
calamities
under
various
forms
complained
that
god
was
departed
from
them
he
replies
that
his
benignity
will
not
fail
them
if
they
return
to
rectitude
of
life
and
to
himself
who
is
the
standard
of
righteousness
the
passage
then
is
miserably
perverted
when
it
is
made
to
represent
the
work
of
conversion
as
divided
between
god
and
men
we
have
observed
the
greater
brevity
on
these
points
because
it
will
be
a
more
suitable
place
for
this
argument
when
we
treat
of
the
law
x
the
second
description
of
arguments
is
nearly
allied
to
the
first
they
allege
the
promises
in
which
god
covenants
with
our
will
such
as
seek
good
and
not
evil
that
ye
may
if
ye
be
willing
and
obedient
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
but
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel
ye
shall
be
devoured
with
the
sword
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
again
if
thou
wilt
put
away
thine
abominations
out
of
my
sight
then
shalt
thou
not
if
thou
shalt
hearken
diligently
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
observe
and
to
do
all
his
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
the
lord
thy
god
will
set
thee
on
high
above
all
nations
of
the
earth
and
other
similar
passages
they
consider
it
an
absurdity
and
mockery
that
the
benefits
which
the
lord
offers
in
the
promises
are
referred
to
our
will
unless
it
be
in
our
power
either
to
confirm
or
to
frustrate
them
and
truly
it
is
very
easy
to
amplify
this
subject
with
eloquent
complaints
that
we
are
cruelly
mocked
by
the
lord
when
he
announces
that
his
benignity
depends
on
our
will
if
that
will
be
not
in
our
own
power
that
this
would
be
egregious
liberality
in
god
to
present
his
benefits
to
us
in
such
a
manner
that
we
should
have
no
power
to
enjoy
them
and
that
there
must
be
a
strange
certainty
in
his
promises
if
they
depend
on
a
thing
impossible
so
that
they
can
never
be
fulfilled
concerning
promises
of
this
kind
to
which
a
condition
is
annexed
we
shall
speak
in
another
place
and
evince
that
there
is
no
absurdity
in
the
impossibility
of
their
completion
with
respect
to
the
present
question
i
deny
that
god
is
cruel
or
insincere
to
us
when
he
invites
us
to
merit
his
favours
though
he
knows
us
to
be
altogether
incapable
of
doing
this
for
as
the
promises
are
offered
equally
to
the
faithful
and
to
the
impious
they
have
their
use
with
them
both
as
by
the
precepts
god
disturbs
the
consciences
of
the
impious
that
they
may
not
enjoy
too
much
pleasure
in
sin
without
any
recollection
of
his
judgments
so
in
the
promises
he
calls
them
to
attest
how
unworthy
they
are
of
his
kindness
for
who
can
deny
that
it
is
most
equitable
and
proper
for
the
lord
to
bless
those
who
worship
him
and
severely
to
punish
the
despisers
of
his
majesty
god
acts
therefore
in
a
right
and
orderly
manner
when
addressing
the
impious
who
are
bound
with
the
fetters
of
sin
he
adds
to
the
promises
this
condition
that
when
they
shall
have
departed
from
their
wickedness
they
shall
then
and
not
till
then
enjoy
his
favours
even
for
this
sole
reason
that
they
may
know
that
they
are
deservedly
excluded
from
those
benefits
which
belong
to
the
worshippers
of
the
true
god
on
the
other
hand
since
he
designs
by
all
means
to
stimulate
the
faithful
to
implore
his
grace
it
will
not
be
at
all
strange
if
he
tries
in
his
promises
also
what
we
have
shown
he
does
with
considerable
effect
in
his
precepts
being
instructed
by
the
precepts
concerning
the
will
of
god
we
are
apprized
of
our
misery
in
having
our
hearts
so
completely
averse
to
it
and
are
at
the
same
time
excited
to
invoke
his
spirit
that
we
may
be
directed
by
him
into
the
right
way
but
because
our
sluggishness
is
not
sufficiently
roused
by
the
precepts
god
adds
his
promises
to
allure
us
by
their
sweetness
to
the
love
of
his
commands
now
in
proportion
to
our
increased
love
of
righteousness
will
be
the
increase
of
our
fervour
in
seeking
the
grace
of
god
see
how
in
these
addresses
if
ye
be
willing
if
ye
be
obedient
the
lord
neither
attributes
to
us
an
unlimited
power
to
will
and
to
obey
nor
yet
mocks
us
on
account
of
our
impotence
xi
the
third
class
of
arguments
also
has
a
great
affinity
with
the
preceding
for
they
produce
passages
in
which
god
reproaches
an
ungrateful
people
that
it
was
wholly
owing
to
their
own
fault
that
they
did
not
receive
blessings
of
all
kinds
from
his
indulgent
hand
of
this
kind
are
the
following
passages
the
amalekites
and
the
canaanites
are
there
before
you
and
ye
shall
fall
by
the
sword
because
ye
are
turned
away
from
the
because
i
called
you
but
ye
answered
not
therefore
will
i
do
unto
this
house
as
i
have
done
to
again
this
is
a
nation
that
obeyeth
not
the
voice
of
the
lord
their
god
nor
receiveth
correction
the
lord
hath
rejected
and
forsaken
the
generation
of
his
again
they
obeyed
not
thy
voice
neither
walked
in
thy
law
they
have
done
nothing
of
all
that
thou
commandedst
them
to
do
therefore
thou
hast
caused
all
this
evil
to
come
upon
how
say
they
could
such
reproaches
be
applicable
to
those
who
might
immediately
reply
it
is
true
that
we
desired
prosperity
and
dreaded
adversity
but
our
not
obeying
the
lord
or
hearkening
to
his
voice
in
order
to
obtain
good
and
to
avoid
evil
has
been
owing
to
our
want
of
liberty
and
subjection
to
the
dominion
of
sin
it
is
in
vain
therefore
to
reproach
us
with
evils
which
we
had
no
power
to
avoid
in
answer
to
this
leaving
the
pretext
of
necessity
which
is
but
a
weak
and
futile
plea
i
ask
whether
they
can
exculpate
themselves
from
all
guilt
for
if
they
are
convicted
of
any
fault
the
lord
justly
reproaches
them
with
their
perverseness
as
the
cause
of
their
not
having
experienced
the
advantage
of
his
clemency
let
them
answer
then
if
they
can
deny
that
their
own
perverse
will
was
the
cause
of
their
obstinacy
if
they
find
the
source
of
the
evil
within
themselves
why
do
they
so
earnestly
inquire
after
extraneous
causes
that
they
may
not
appear
to
have
been
the
authors
of
their
own
ruin
but
if
it
be
true
that
sinners
are
deprived
of
the
favours
of
god
and
chastised
with
his
punishments
for
their
own
sin
and
only
for
their
own
there
is
great
reason
why
they
should
hear
those
reproaches
from
his
mouth
that
if
they
obstinately
persist
in
their
crimes
they
may
learn
in
their
calamities
rather
to
accuse
and
detest
their
iniquity
than
to
charge
god
with
unrighteous
cruelty
that
if
they
have
not
cast
off
all
docility
they
may
become
weary
of
their
sins
the
demerits
of
which
they
see
to
be
misery
and
ruin
and
may
return
into
the
good
way
acknowledging
in
a
serious
confession
the
very
thing
for
which
the
lord
rebukes
them
and
that
those
reproofs
which
are
quoted
from
the
prophets
have
produced
this
beneficial
effect
on
the
faithful
is
evident
from
the
solemn
prayer
of
daniel
given
us
in
his
ninth
chapter
of
the
former
use
of
them
we
find
an
example
in
the
jews
to
whom
jeremiah
is
commanded
to
declare
the
cause
of
their
miseries
though
nothing
could
befall
them
otherwise
than
the
lord
had
foretold
thou
shalt
speak
all
these
words
unto
them
but
they
will
not
hearken
to
thee
thou
shalt
also
call
unto
them
but
they
will
not
answer
for
what
purpose
then
it
will
be
asked
did
they
speak
to
persons
that
were
deaf
it
was
in
order
that
in
spite
of
their
disinclination
and
aversion
they
might
know
what
was
declared
to
them
to
be
true
that
it
was
an
abominable
sacrilege
to
transfer
to
god
the
guilt
of
their
crimes
which
belonged
solely
to
themselves
with
these
few
solutions
we
may
very
easily
despatch
the
immense
multitude
of
testimonies
which
the
enemies
of
the
grace
of
god
are
accustomed
to
collect
both
from
the
precepts
of
the
law
and
from
the
expostulations
directed
to
transgressors
of
it
in
order
to
establish
the
idol
of
free
will
in
one
psalm
the
jews
are
stigmatized
as
a
stubborn
and
rebellious
generation
a
generation
that
set
not
their
heart
in
another
the
psalmist
exhorts
the
men
of
his
age
to
harden
not
their
hearts
which
implies
that
all
the
guilt
of
rebellion
lies
in
the
perverseness
of
men
but
it
is
absurd
to
infer
from
this
passage
that
the
heart
is
equally
flexible
to
either
side
whereas
the
preparation
of
it
is
from
the
the
psalmist
says
i
have
inclined
my
heart
to
perform
thy
statutes
because
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
service
of
god
without
any
reluctance
but
with
a
cheerful
readiness
of
mind
yet
he
boasts
not
of
being
himself
the
author
of
this
inclination
which
in
the
same
psalm
he
acknowledges
to
be
the
gift
of
god
we
should
remember
therefore
the
admonition
of
paul
when
he
commands
the
faithful
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
for
it
is
god
which
worketh
in
them
both
to
will
and
to
he
assigns
them
a
part
to
perform
that
they
may
not
indulge
themselves
in
carnal
negligence
but
by
inculcating
fear
and
trembling
he
humbles
them
and
reminds
them
that
this
very
thing
which
they
are
commanded
to
do
is
the
peculiar
work
of
god
in
this
he
plainly
suggests
that
the
faithful
act
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
passively
inasmuch
as
they
are
furnished
with
strength
from
heaven
that
they
may
arrogate
nothing
at
all
to
themselves
wherefore
when
peter
exhorts
us
to
add
to
our
faith
virtue
he
does
not
allot
us
an
under
part
to
be
performed
as
though
we
could
do
any
thing
separately
of
ourselves
he
only
arouses
the
indolence
of
the
flesh
by
which
faith
itself
is
frequently
extinguished
to
the
same
purpose
is
the
exhortation
of
paul
quench
not
the
spirit
for
slothfulness
gradually
prevails
over
the
faithful
unless
it
be
corrected
but
if
any
one
should
infer
from
this
that
it
is
at
his
own
option
to
cherish
the
light
offered
him
his
ignorance
will
easily
be
refuted
since
this
diligence
which
paul
requires
proceeds
only
from
god
for
we
are
also
frequently
commanded
to
cleanse
ourselves
from
all
filthiness
whilst
the
spirit
claims
the
office
of
sanctifying
us
exclusively
to
himself
in
short
that
what
properly
belongs
to
god
is
by
concession
transferred
to
us
is
plain
from
the
words
of
john
he
that
is
begotten
of
god
keepeth
the
preachers
of
free
will
lay
hold
of
this
expression
as
though
we
were
saved
partly
by
the
divine
power
partly
by
our
own
as
though
we
did
not
receive
from
heaven
this
very
preservation
which
the
apostle
mentions
wherefore
also
christ
prays
that
his
father
would
keep
us
from
evil
and
we
know
that
the
pious
in
their
warfare
against
satan
obtain
the
victory
by
no
other
arms
than
those
which
are
furnished
by
god
therefore
peter
having
enjoined
us
to
purify
our
souls
in
obeying
the
truth
immediately
adds
as
a
correction
through
the
finally
the
impotence
of
all
human
strength
in
the
spiritual
conflict
is
briefly
demonstrated
by
john
when
he
says
whosoever
is
born
of
god
can
not
sin
for
his
seed
remaineth
in
him
and
in
another
place
he
adds
the
reason
that
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
even
our
xii
there
is
also
a
testimony
cited
from
the
law
of
moses
which
appears
directly
repugnant
to
our
solution
for
after
having
published
the
law
he
makes
the
following
solemn
declaration
to
the
people
this
commandment
which
i
command
thee
this
day
it
is
not
hidden
from
thee
neither
is
it
far
off
it
is
not
in
heaven
but
the
word
is
very
nigh
unto
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
that
thou
mayest
do
if
these
expressions
be
understood
merely
of
the
precepts
i
grant
that
they
have
much
weight
in
the
present
argument
for
although
we
might
easily
elude
their
force
by
saying
that
they
treat
of
the
facility
and
promptitude
not
of
observance
but
of
knowledge
yet
still
perhaps
they
might
leave
some
doubt
but
the
apostle
in
whose
expositions
there
is
no
ambiguity
removes
all
our
doubts
by
affirming
that
moses
here
spake
of
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
but
if
any
one
should
obstinately
contend
that
paul
has
violently
perverted
the
passage
from
its
genuine
meaning
by
applying
it
to
the
gospel
although
his
presumption
could
not
be
acquitted
of
impiety
yet
there
is
enough
to
refute
him
independently
of
the
authority
of
the
apostle
for
if
moses
spoke
only
of
the
precepts
he
was
deceiving
the
people
with
the
vainest
confidence
for
would
they
not
have
precipitated
themselves
into
ruin
if
they
had
attempted
the
observance
of
the
law
in
their
own
strength
as
a
thing
of
no
difficulty
what
then
becomes
of
the
very
obvious
facility
with
which
the
law
may
be
observed
when
there
appears
no
access
to
it
but
over
a
fatal
precipice
wherefore
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
moses
in
these
words
comprehended
the
covenant
of
mercy
which
he
had
promulgated
together
with
the
precepts
of
the
law
for
in
a
preceding
verse
he
had
taught
that
our
hearts
must
be
circumcised
by
god
in
order
that
we
may
love
him
therefore
he
placed
this
facility
of
which
he
afterwards
speaks
not
in
the
strength
of
man
but
in
the
assistance
and
protection
of
the
holy
spirit
who
powerfully
accomplishes
his
work
in
our
infirmity
however
the
passage
is
not
to
be
understood
simply
of
the
precepts
but
rather
of
the
promises
of
the
gospel
which
are
so
far
from
maintaining
an
ability
in
us
to
obtain
righteousness
that
they
prove
us
to
be
utterly
destitute
of
it
paul
considering
the
same
proves
by
this
testimony
that
salvation
is
proposed
to
us
in
the
gospel
not
under
that
hard
difficult
and
impossible
condition
prescribed
to
us
in
the
law
which
pronounces
it
attainable
only
by
those
who
have
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
but
under
a
condition
easily
and
readily
to
be
performed
therefore
this
testimony
contributes
nothing
to
support
the
liberty
of
the
human
will
xiii
some
other
passages
also
are
frequently
objected
which
show
that
god
sometimes
tries
men
by
withdrawing
the
assistance
of
his
grace
and
waits
to
see
what
course
they
will
pursue
as
in
hosea
i
will
go
and
return
to
my
place
till
they
acknowledge
their
offence
and
seek
my
it
would
be
ridiculous
they
say
for
the
lord
to
consider
whether
israel
would
seek
his
face
unless
their
minds
were
flexible
capable
of
inclining
either
way
according
to
their
own
pleasure
as
if
it
were
not
very
common
for
god
in
the
prophets
to
represent
himself
as
despising
and
rejecting
his
people
till
they
should
amend
their
lives
but
what
will
our
adversaries
infer
from
such
threats
if
they
maintain
that
those
who
are
deserted
by
god
are
capable
of
converting
themselves
they
oppose
the
uniform
declarations
of
scripture
if
they
acknowledge
that
the
grace
of
god
is
necessary
to
conversion
what
is
their
controversy
with
us
but
they
will
reply
that
they
concede
its
necessity
in
such
a
sense
as
to
maintain
that
man
still
retains
some
power
how
do
they
prove
it
certainly
not
from
this
or
any
similar
passages
for
it
is
one
thing
to
depart
from
a
man
to
observe
what
he
will
do
when
forsaken
and
left
to
himself
and
another
to
assist
his
little
strength
in
proportion
to
his
imbecility
what
then
it
will
be
inquired
is
implied
in
such
forms
of
expression
i
reply
that
the
import
of
them
is
just
as
if
god
had
said
since
admonitions
exhortations
and
reproofs
produce
no
good
effect
on
this
rebellious
people
i
will
withdraw
myself
for
a
little
while
and
silently
leave
them
to
affliction
i
will
see
whether
at
some
future
period
after
a
series
of
calamities
they
will
remember
me
and
seek
my
face
the
departure
of
the
lord
signifies
the
removal
of
his
word
his
observing
what
men
will
do
signifies
his
concealing
himself
in
silence
and
exercising
them
for
a
season
with
various
afflictions
he
does
both
to
humble
us
the
more
for
we
should
sooner
be
confounded
than
corrected
with
the
scourges
of
adversity
unless
he
rendered
us
docile
by
his
spirit
now
when
the
lord
offended
and
as
it
were
wearied
by
our
extreme
obstinacy
leaves
us
for
a
time
by
the
removal
of
his
word
in
which
he
is
accustomed
to
manifest
his
presence
with
us
and
makes
the
experiment
what
we
shall
do
in
his
absence
is
falsely
inferred
from
this
that
there
is
some
power
of
free
will
which
he
observes
and
proves
since
he
acts
in
this
manner
with
no
other
design
than
to
bring
us
to
a
sense
and
acknowledgment
of
our
own
nothingness
xiv
they
argue
also
from
the
manner
of
expression
which
is
invariably
observed
both
in
the
scripture
and
in
the
common
conversation
of
mankind
for
good
actions
are
called
our
own
and
we
are
said
to
perform
what
is
holy
and
pleasing
to
the
lord
as
well
as
to
commit
sins
but
if
sins
be
justly
imputed
to
us
as
proceeding
from
ourselves
certainly
some
share
ought
to
be
for
the
same
reason
assigned
to
us
also
in
works
of
righteousness
for
it
would
be
absurd
that
we
should
be
said
to
do
those
things
to
the
performance
of
which
being
incapable
of
any
exertion
of
our
own
we
were
impelled
by
god
as
so
many
stones
wherefore
though
we
allow
the
grace
of
god
the
preëminence
yet
these
expressions
indicate
that
our
own
endeavours
hold
at
least
the
second
place
if
it
were
only
alleged
that
good
works
are
called
our
own
i
would
reply
that
the
bread
which
we
pray
to
god
to
give
us
is
called
ours
what
will
they
prove
by
this
term
but
that
what
otherwise
by
no
means
belongs
to
us
becomes
ours
through
the
benignity
and
gratuitous
munificence
of
god
therefore
let
them
either
ridicule
the
same
absurdity
in
the
lord
s
prayer
or
no
longer
esteem
it
ridiculous
that
good
works
are
denominated
ours
in
which
we
have
no
propriety
but
from
the
liberality
of
god
but
there
is
rather
more
force
in
what
follows
that
the
scripture
frequently
affirms
that
we
ourselves
worship
god
work
righteousness
obey
the
law
and
perform
good
works
these
being
the
proper
offices
of
the
understanding
and
will
how
could
they
justly
be
referred
to
the
spirit
and
at
the
same
time
be
attributed
to
us
if
there
were
not
some
union
of
our
exertions
with
the
grace
of
god
we
shall
easily
extricate
ourselves
from
these
objections
if
we
properly
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
spirit
of
the
lord
operates
in
the
saints
the
similitude
with
which
they
try
to
cast
an
odium
on
our
sentiments
is
quite
foreign
to
the
subject
for
who
is
so
senseless
as
to
suppose
that
there
is
no
difference
between
impelling
a
man
and
throwing
a
stone
nor
does
any
such
consequence
follow
from
our
doctrine
we
rank
among
the
natural
powers
of
man
approving
rejecting
willing
nilling
attempting
resisting
that
is
a
power
to
approve
vanity
and
to
reject
true
excellence
to
will
what
is
evil
to
refuse
what
is
good
to
attempt
iniquity
and
to
resist
righteousness
what
concern
has
the
lord
in
this
if
it
be
his
will
to
use
this
depravity
as
an
instrument
of
his
wrath
he
directs
and
appoints
it
according
to
his
pleasure
in
order
to
execute
his
good
work
by
means
of
a
wicked
hand
shall
we
then
compare
a
wicked
man
who
is
thus
subservient
to
the
divine
power
while
he
only
studies
to
gratify
his
own
corrupt
inclination
to
a
stone
which
is
hurled
by
an
extrinsic
impulse
and
driven
along
without
any
motion
sense
or
will
of
its
own
we
perceive
what
a
vast
difference
there
is
but
how
does
the
lord
operate
in
good
men
to
whom
the
question
principally
relates
when
he
erects
his
kingdom
within
them
he
by
his
spirit
restrains
their
will
that
it
may
not
be
hurried
away
by
unsteady
and
violent
passions
according
to
the
propensity
of
nature
that
it
may
be
inclined
to
holiness
and
righteousness
he
bends
composes
forms
and
directs
it
according
to
the
rule
of
his
own
righteousness
that
it
may
not
stagger
or
fall
he
establishes
and
confirms
it
by
the
power
of
his
spirit
for
which
reason
augustine
says
you
will
reply
to
me
then
we
are
actuated
we
do
not
act
yes
you
both
act
and
are
actuated
and
you
act
well
when
you
are
actuated
by
that
which
is
good
the
spirit
of
god
who
actuates
you
assists
those
who
act
and
calls
himself
a
helper
because
you
also
perform
in
the
first
clause
he
inculcates
that
the
agency
of
man
is
not
destroyed
by
the
influence
of
the
spirit
because
the
will
which
is
guided
to
aspire
to
what
is
good
belongs
to
his
nature
but
the
inference
which
he
immediately
subjoins
from
the
term
that
we
also
perform
something
we
should
not
understand
in
such
a
sense
as
though
he
attributed
any
thing
to
us
independently
but
in
order
to
avoid
encouraging
us
in
indolence
he
reconciles
the
divine
agency
with
ours
in
this
way
that
to
will
is
from
nature
to
will
what
is
good
is
from
grace
therefore
he
had
just
before
said
without
the
assistance
of
god
we
shall
be
not
only
unable
to
conquer
but
even
to
xv
hence
it
appears
that
the
grace
of
god
in
the
sense
in
which
this
word
is
used
when
we
treat
of
regeneration
is
the
rule
of
the
spirit
for
directing
and
governing
the
human
will
he
can
not
govern
it
unless
he
correct
reform
and
renovate
it
whence
we
say
that
the
commencement
of
regeneration
is
an
abolition
of
what
is
from
ourselves
nor
unless
he
also
excite
actuate
impel
support
and
restrain
it
whence
we
truly
assert
that
all
the
actions
which
proceed
from
this
are
entirely
of
the
spirit
at
the
same
time
we
fully
admit
the
truth
of
what
augustine
teaches
that
the
will
is
not
destroyed
by
grace
but
rather
repaired
for
these
two
things
are
perfectly
the
human
will
may
be
said
to
be
repaired
when
by
the
correction
of
its
depravity
and
perverseness
it
is
directed
according
to
the
true
standard
of
righteousness
and
also
that
a
new
will
may
be
said
to
be
created
in
man
because
the
natural
will
is
so
vitiated
and
corrupted
that
it
needs
to
be
formed
entirely
anew
now
there
is
no
reason
why
we
may
not
justly
be
said
to
perform
that
which
the
spirit
of
god
performs
in
us
although
our
own
will
contributes
nothing
of
itself
independently
of
his
grace
and
therefore
we
should
remember
what
we
have
before
cited
from
augustine
that
many
persons
labour
in
vain
to
find
in
the
human
will
some
good
properly
its
own
for
whatever
mixture
men
study
to
add
from
the
power
of
free
will
to
the
grace
of
god
is
only
a
corruption
of
it
just
as
if
any
one
should
dilute
good
wine
with
dirty
or
bitter
water
but
although
whatever
good
there
is
in
the
human
will
proceeds
wholly
from
the
internal
influence
of
the
spirit
yet
because
we
have
a
natural
faculty
of
willing
we
are
not
without
reason
said
to
do
those
things
the
praise
of
which
god
justly
claims
to
himself
first
because
whatever
god
does
in
us
becomes
ours
by
his
benignity
provided
we
do
not
apprehend
it
to
originate
from
ourselves
secondly
because
the
understanding
is
ours
the
will
is
ours
and
the
effort
is
ours
which
are
all
directed
by
him
to
that
which
is
good
xvi
the
other
testimonies
which
they
rake
together
from
every
quarter
will
not
much
embarrass
even
persons
of
moderate
capacities
who
have
well
digested
the
answers
already
given
they
quote
this
passage
from
genesis
unto
thee
shall
be
his
desire
and
thou
shalt
rule
over
him
or
as
they
would
translate
the
words
subject
to
thee
shall
be
its
appetite
and
thou
shalt
rule
over
it
which
they
explain
to
relate
to
sin
as
though
the
lord
promised
cain
that
the
power
of
sin
should
not
obtain
dominion
over
his
mind
if
he
would
labour
to
overcome
it
but
we
say
that
it
is
more
agreeable
to
the
tenor
of
the
context
to
understand
it
to
be
spoken
concerning
abel
for
the
design
of
god
in
it
is
to
prove
the
iniquity
of
that
envy
which
cain
had
conceived
against
his
brother
this
he
does
by
two
reasons
first
that
it
was
in
vain
for
him
to
meditate
crimes
in
order
to
excel
his
brother
in
the
sight
of
god
with
whom
no
honour
is
given
but
to
righteousness
secondly
that
he
was
extremely
ungrateful
for
the
favours
god
had
already
conferred
on
him
since
he
could
not
bear
his
brother
even
though
subject
to
his
authority
but
that
we
may
not
appear
to
adopt
this
explanation
merely
because
the
other
is
unfavourable
to
our
tenets
let
us
admit
that
god
spake
concerning
sin
if
it
be
so
then
what
the
lord
there
declares
is
either
promised
or
commanded
by
him
if
it
be
a
command
we
have
already
demonstrated
that
it
affords
no
proof
of
the
power
of
men
if
it
be
a
promise
where
is
the
completion
of
the
promise
seeing
that
cain
fell
under
the
dominion
of
sin
over
which
he
ought
to
have
prevailed
they
will
say
that
the
promise
includes
a
tacit
condition
as
though
it
had
been
declared
to
him
that
he
should
obtain
the
victory
if
he
would
contend
for
it
but
who
can
admit
these
subterfuges
for
if
this
dominion
be
referred
to
sin
the
speech
is
doubtless
a
command
expressive
not
of
our
ability
but
of
our
duty
which
remains
our
duty
even
though
it
exceed
our
ability
but
the
subject
itself
and
grammatical
propriety
require
a
comparison
to
be
made
between
cain
and
abel
in
which
the
elder
brother
would
not
have
been
placed
below
the
younger
if
he
had
not
degraded
himself
by
his
own
wickedness
xvii
they
adduce
also
the
testimony
of
the
apostle
who
says
that
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
god
that
showeth
mercy
whence
they
conclude
that
there
is
something
in
the
will
and
endeavour
which
though
ineffectual
of
itself
is
rendered
successful
by
the
assistance
of
the
divine
mercy
but
if
they
would
soberly
examine
the
subject
there
treated
by
paul
they
would
not
so
inconsiderately
pervert
this
passage
i
know
that
they
can
allege
the
suffrages
of
origen
and
jerome
in
defence
of
their
exposition
and
in
opposition
to
them
i
could
produce
that
of
augustine
but
their
opinions
are
of
no
importance
to
us
if
we
can
ascertain
what
was
the
meaning
of
paul
he
is
there
teaching
that
salvation
is
provided
for
them
alone
whom
the
lord
favours
with
his
mercy
but
that
ruin
and
perdition
await
all
those
whom
he
has
not
chosen
he
had
shown
by
the
example
of
pharaoh
the
condition
of
the
reprobate
and
had
confirmed
the
certainty
of
gratuitous
election
by
the
testimony
of
moses
i
will
have
mercy
on
whom
i
will
have
his
conclusion
is
that
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
but
of
god
that
showeth
if
this
be
understood
to
imply
that
our
will
and
endeavour
are
not
sufficient
because
they
are
not
equal
to
so
great
a
work
paul
has
expressed
himself
with
great
impropriety
away
therefore
with
these
sophisms
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
therefore
there
is
some
willing
and
some
running
for
the
meaning
of
paul
is
more
is
neither
our
willing
nor
our
running
which
procures
for
us
a
way
of
salvation
but
solely
the
mercy
of
god
for
he
expresses
here
the
same
sentiment
as
he
does
to
titus
when
he
says
that
the
kindness
and
love
of
god
towards
man
appeared
not
by
works
of
righteousness
which
we
have
done
but
according
to
his
the
very
persons
who
argue
that
paul
in
denying
that
it
is
of
him
that
willeth
or
of
him
that
runneth
implies
that
there
is
some
willing
and
some
running
would
not
allow
me
to
use
the
same
mode
of
reasoning
that
we
have
done
some
good
works
because
paul
denies
that
we
have
obtained
the
favour
of
god
by
any
works
which
we
have
done
but
if
they
perceive
a
flaw
in
this
argumentation
let
them
open
their
eyes
and
they
will
perceive
a
similar
fallacy
in
their
own
for
the
argument
on
which
augustine
rests
the
dispute
is
unanswerable
if
it
be
said
that
it
is
not
of
him
that
willeth
nor
of
him
that
runneth
merely
because
neither
our
willing
nor
our
running
is
sufficient
it
may
on
the
contrary
be
retorted
that
it
is
not
of
the
mercy
of
god
because
that
does
not
act
the
latter
position
being
absurd
augustine
justly
concludes
the
meaning
of
this
passage
to
be
that
there
is
no
good
will
in
man
unless
it
be
prepared
by
the
lord
not
but
that
we
ought
to
will
and
to
run
but
because
god
works
in
us
both
the
one
and
the
other
with
similar
want
of
judgment
some
pervert
this
declaration
of
paul
we
are
labourers
together
with
god
which
without
doubt
is
restricted
solely
to
ministers
who
are
denominated
workers
with
him
not
that
they
contribute
any
thing
of
themselves
but
because
god
makes
use
of
their
agency
after
he
has
qualified
them
and
furnished
them
with
the
necessary
talents
xviii
they
produce
a
passage
from
ecclesiasticus
which
is
well
known
to
be
a
book
of
doubtful
authority
but
though
we
should
not
reject
it
which
nevertheless
if
we
chose
we
might
justly
do
what
testimony
does
it
afford
in
support
of
free
will
the
writer
says
that
man
as
soon
as
he
was
created
was
left
in
the
power
of
his
own
will
that
precepts
were
given
to
him
which
if
he
kept
he
should
also
be
kept
by
them
that
he
had
life
and
death
good
and
evil
set
before
him
and
that
whatever
he
desired
would
be
given
him
let
it
be
granted
that
man
at
his
creation
was
endowed
with
a
power
of
choosing
life
or
death
what
if
we
reply
that
he
has
lost
it
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
contradict
solomon
who
asserts
that
god
hath
made
man
upright
but
they
have
sought
out
many
but
man
by
his
degeneracy
having
shipwrecked
both
himself
and
all
his
excellences
whatever
is
attributed
to
his
primitive
state
it
does
not
immediately
follow
that
it
belongs
to
his
vitiated
and
degenerated
nature
therefore
i
reply
not
only
to
them
but
also
to
ecclesiasticus
himself
whoever
he
be
if
you
design
to
teach
man
to
seek
within
himself
a
power
to
attain
salvation
your
authority
is
not
so
great
in
our
estimation
as
to
obtain
even
the
smallest
degree
of
credit
in
opposition
to
the
undoubted
word
of
god
but
if
you
only
aim
to
repress
the
malignity
of
the
flesh
which
vainly
attempts
to
vindicate
itself
by
transferring
its
crimes
to
god
and
you
therefore
reply
that
man
was
originally
endued
with
rectitude
from
which
it
is
evident
that
he
was
the
cause
of
his
own
ruin
i
readily
assent
to
it
provided
we
also
agree
in
this
that
through
his
own
guilt
he
is
now
despoiled
of
those
ornaments
with
which
god
invested
him
at
the
beginning
and
so
unite
in
confessing
that
in
his
present
situation
he
needs
not
an
advocate
but
a
physician
xix
but
there
is
nothing
which
our
adversaries
have
more
frequently
in
their
mouths
than
the
parable
of
christ
concerning
the
traveller
who
was
left
by
robbers
in
the
road
half
dead
i
know
it
is
the
common
opinion
of
almost
all
writers
that
the
calamity
of
the
human
race
is
represented
under
the
type
of
this
traveller
hence
they
argue
that
man
is
not
so
mutilated
by
the
violence
of
sin
and
the
devil
but
that
he
still
retains
some
relics
of
his
former
excellences
since
he
is
said
to
have
been
left
only
half
dead
for
what
becomes
of
the
remaining
portion
of
life
unless
there
remain
some
rectitude
both
of
reason
and
will
in
the
first
place
what
could
they
say
if
i
refused
to
admit
their
allegory
for
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
this
interpretation
invented
by
the
fathers
is
foreign
to
the
genuine
sense
of
our
lord
s
discourse
allegories
ought
to
be
extended
no
further
than
they
are
supported
by
the
authority
of
scripture
for
they
are
far
from
affording
of
themselves
a
sufficient
foundation
for
any
doctrines
nor
is
there
any
want
of
arguments
by
which
if
i
chose
i
could
completely
confute
this
erroneous
notion
for
the
word
of
god
does
not
leave
man
in
the
possession
of
a
proportion
of
life
but
teaches
that
as
far
as
respects
happiness
of
life
he
is
wholly
dead
paul
when
speaking
of
our
redemption
says
not
that
we
were
recovered
when
half
dead
but
that
even
when
we
were
dead
we
were
raised
he
calls
not
on
the
half
dead
but
on
those
who
are
in
the
grave
sleeping
the
sleep
of
death
to
receive
the
illumination
of
christ
and
the
lord
himself
speaks
in
a
similar
manner
when
he
says
that
the
hour
is
coming
and
now
is
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
god
and
they
that
hear
shall
with
what
face
can
they
oppose
a
slight
allusion
against
so
many
positive
expressions
yet
let
this
allegory
even
be
admitted
as
a
clear
testimony
what
will
it
enable
them
to
extort
from
us
man
they
will
say
is
but
half
dead
therefore
he
has
some
faculty
remaining
entire
i
grant
that
he
has
a
mind
capable
of
understanding
though
it
attains
not
to
heavenly
and
spiritual
wisdom
he
has
some
idea
of
virtue
he
has
some
sense
of
the
deity
though
he
acquires
not
the
true
knowledge
of
god
but
what
is
to
be
concluded
from
all
this
it
certainly
does
not
disprove
the
assertion
of
augustine
which
has
received
the
general
approbation
even
of
the
schools
that
man
since
his
fall
has
been
deprived
of
the
gifts
of
grace
on
which
salvation
depends
but
that
the
natural
ones
are
corrupted
and
polluted
let
us
hold
this
then
as
an
undoubted
truth
which
no
opposition
can
ever
the
mind
of
man
is
so
completely
alienated
from
the
righteousness
of
god
that
it
conceives
desires
and
undertakes
every
thing
that
is
impious
perverse
base
impure
and
flagitious
that
his
heart
is
so
thoroughly
infected
by
the
poison
of
sin
that
it
can
not
produce
any
thing
but
what
is
corrupt
and
that
if
at
any
time
men
do
any
thing
apparently
good
yet
the
mind
always
remains
involved
in
hypocrisy
and
fallacious
obliquity
and
the
heart
enslaved
by
its
inward
perverseness
chapter
vi
redemption
for
lost
man
to
be
sought
in
christ
the
whole
human
race
having
perished
in
the
person
of
adam
our
original
excellence
and
dignity
which
we
have
noticed
so
far
from
being
advantageous
to
us
only
involves
us
in
greater
ignominy
till
god
who
does
not
acknowledge
the
pollution
and
corruption
of
man
by
sin
to
be
his
work
appears
as
a
redeemer
in
the
person
of
his
only
begotten
son
therefore
since
we
are
fallen
from
life
into
death
all
that
knowledge
of
god
as
a
creator
of
which
we
have
been
treating
would
be
useless
unless
it
were
succeeded
by
faith
exhibiting
god
to
us
as
a
father
in
christ
this
indeed
was
the
genuine
order
of
nature
that
the
fabric
of
the
world
should
be
a
school
in
which
we
might
learn
piety
and
thence
be
conducted
to
eternal
life
and
perfect
felicity
but
since
the
fall
whithersoever
we
turn
our
eyes
the
curse
of
god
meets
us
on
every
side
which
whilst
it
seizes
innocent
creatures
and
involves
them
in
our
guilt
must
necessarily
overwhelm
our
souls
with
despair
for
though
god
is
pleased
still
to
manifest
his
paternal
kindness
to
us
in
various
ways
yet
we
can
not
from
a
contemplation
of
the
world
conclude
that
he
is
our
father
when
our
conscience
disturbs
us
within
and
convinces
us
that
our
sins
afford
a
just
reason
why
god
should
abandon
us
and
no
longer
esteem
us
as
his
children
we
are
also
chargeable
with
stupidity
and
ingratitude
for
our
minds
being
blinded
do
not
perceive
the
truth
and
all
our
senses
being
corrupted
we
wickedly
defraud
god
of
his
glory
we
must
therefore
subscribe
to
the
declaration
of
paul
for
after
that
in
the
wisdom
of
god
the
world
by
wisdom
knew
not
god
it
pleased
god
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
to
save
them
that
what
he
denominates
the
wisdom
of
god
is
this
magnificent
theatre
of
heaven
and
earth
which
is
replete
with
innumerable
miracles
and
from
the
contemplation
of
which
we
ought
wisely
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of
god
but
because
we
have
made
so
little
improvement
in
this
way
he
recalls
us
to
the
faith
of
christ
which
is
despised
by
unbelievers
on
account
of
its
apparent
folly
wherefore
though
the
preaching
of
the
cross
is
not
agreeable
to
human
reason
we
ought
nevertheless
to
embrace
it
with
all
humility
if
we
desire
to
return
to
god
our
creator
from
whom
we
have
been
alienated
and
to
have
him
reassume
the
character
of
our
father
since
the
fall
of
the
first
man
no
knowledge
of
god
without
the
mediator
has
been
available
to
salvation
for
christ
speaks
not
of
his
own
time
only
but
comprehends
all
ages
when
he
says
that
this
is
life
eternal
to
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
and
this
aggravates
the
stupidity
of
those
who
set
open
the
gate
of
heaven
to
all
unbelievers
and
profane
persons
without
the
grace
of
christ
whom
the
scripture
universally
represents
as
the
only
door
of
entrance
into
salvation
but
if
any
man
would
restrict
this
declaration
of
christ
to
the
period
of
the
first
promulgation
of
the
gospel
we
are
prepared
with
a
refutation
for
it
has
been
a
common
opinion
in
all
ages
and
nations
that
those
who
are
alienated
from
god
and
pronounced
accursed
and
children
of
wrath
can
not
please
him
without
a
reconciliation
here
add
the
answer
of
christ
to
the
woman
of
samaria
ye
worship
ye
know
not
what
we
know
what
we
worship
for
salvation
is
of
the
in
these
words
he
at
once
condemns
all
the
religions
of
the
gentiles
as
false
and
assigns
a
reason
for
it
because
under
the
law
the
redeemer
was
promised
only
to
the
chosen
people
whence
it
follows
that
no
worship
has
ever
been
acceptable
to
god
unless
it
had
respect
to
christ
hence
also
paul
affirms
that
all
the
gentiles
were
without
god
and
destitute
of
the
hope
of
life
now
as
john
teaches
us
that
life
was
from
the
beginning
in
christ
and
that
the
whole
world
are
fallen
from
it
it
is
necessary
to
return
to
that
fountain
and
therefore
christ
asserts
himself
to
be
the
life
as
he
is
the
author
of
the
propitiation
and
indeed
the
celestial
inheritance
belongs
exclusively
to
the
children
of
god
but
it
is
very
unreasonable
that
they
should
be
considered
in
the
place
and
order
of
his
children
who
have
not
been
engrafted
into
the
body
of
his
only
begotten
son
and
john
plainly
declares
that
they
who
believe
in
his
name
become
the
sons
of
but
as
it
is
not
my
design
in
this
place
to
treat
professedly
of
faith
in
christ
these
cursory
hints
shall
at
present
suffice
ii
therefore
god
never
showed
himself
propitious
to
his
ancient
people
nor
afforded
them
any
hope
of
his
favour
without
a
mediator
i
forbear
to
speak
of
the
legal
sacrifices
by
which
the
faithful
were
plainly
and
publicly
instructed
that
salvation
was
to
be
sought
solely
in
that
expiation
which
has
been
accomplished
by
christ
alone
i
only
assert
that
the
happiness
of
the
church
has
always
been
founded
on
the
person
of
christ
for
though
god
comprehended
in
his
covenant
all
the
posterity
of
abraham
yet
paul
judiciously
reasons
that
christ
is
in
reality
that
seed
in
whom
all
the
nations
were
to
be
blessed
since
we
know
that
the
natural
descendants
of
that
patriarch
were
not
reckoned
as
his
seed
for
to
say
nothing
of
ishmael
and
others
what
was
the
cause
that
of
the
two
sons
of
isaac
the
esau
and
jacob
even
when
they
were
yet
unborn
one
should
be
chosen
and
the
other
rejected
how
came
it
to
pass
that
the
was
rejected
and
that
the
younger
obtained
his
birthright
how
came
the
majority
of
the
people
to
be
disinherited
it
is
evident
therefore
that
the
seed
of
abraham
is
reckoned
principally
in
one
person
and
that
the
promised
salvation
was
not
manifested
till
the
coming
of
christ
whose
office
it
is
to
collect
what
had
been
scattered
abroad
the
first
adoption
therefore
of
the
chosen
people
depended
on
the
grace
of
the
mediator
which
though
it
is
not
so
plainly
expressed
by
moses
yet
appears
to
have
been
generally
well
known
to
all
the
pious
for
before
the
appointment
of
any
king
in
the
nation
hannah
the
mother
of
samuel
speaking
of
the
felicity
of
the
faithful
thus
expressed
herself
in
her
song
the
lord
shall
give
strength
unto
his
king
and
exalt
the
horn
of
his
her
meaning
in
these
words
is
that
god
will
bless
his
church
and
to
this
agrees
the
oracle
which
is
soon
after
introduced
i
will
raise
me
up
a
faithful
priest
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
design
of
the
heavenly
father
to
exhibit
in
david
and
his
posterity
a
lively
image
of
christ
with
a
design
to
exhort
the
pious
therefore
to
the
fear
of
god
he
enjoins
them
to
kiss
the
son
which
agrees
with
this
declaration
of
the
gospel
he
that
honoureth
not
the
son
honoureth
not
the
therefore
though
the
kingdom
was
weakened
by
the
revolt
of
the
ten
tribes
yet
the
covenant
which
god
had
made
with
david
and
his
successors
could
not
but
stand
as
he
also
declared
by
the
prophets
i
will
not
rend
away
all
the
kingdom
but
will
give
one
tribe
to
thy
son
for
david
my
servant
s
sake
and
for
jerusalem
s
sake
which
i
have
this
is
repeated
again
and
again
it
is
also
expressly
added
i
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
david
but
not
for
at
a
little
distance
of
time
it
is
said
for
david
s
sake
did
the
lord
his
god
give
him
a
lamp
in
jerusalem
to
set
up
his
son
after
him
and
to
establish
even
when
the
state
was
come
to
the
verge
of
ruin
it
was
again
said
the
lord
would
not
destroy
judah
for
david
his
servant
s
sake
as
he
promised
him
to
give
him
alway
a
light
and
to
his
the
sum
of
the
whole
is
david
alone
was
chosen
to
the
rejection
of
all
others
as
the
perpetual
object
of
the
divine
favour
as
it
is
said
in
another
place
he
forsook
the
tabernacle
of
shiloh
he
refused
the
tabernacle
of
joseph
and
chose
not
the
tribe
of
ephraim
but
chose
the
tribe
of
judah
the
mount
zion
which
he
loved
he
chose
david
also
his
servant
to
feed
jacob
his
people
and
israel
his
finally
it
pleased
god
to
preserve
his
church
in
such
a
way
that
its
security
and
salvation
should
depend
on
that
head
david
therefore
exclaims
the
lord
is
their
strength
and
he
is
the
saving
strength
of
his
anointed
and
immediately
adds
this
petition
save
thy
people
and
bless
thine
inheritance
signifying
that
the
state
of
the
church
is
inseparably
connected
with
the
government
of
christ
in
the
same
sense
he
elsewhere
says
save
lord
let
the
king
hear
us
when
we
in
these
words
he
clearly
teaches
us
that
the
faithful
resort
to
god
for
assistance
with
no
other
confidence
than
because
they
are
sheltered
under
the
protection
of
the
king
this
is
to
be
inferred
from
another
psalm
save
o
lord
blessed
be
he
that
cometh
in
the
name
of
the
lord
where
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
the
faithful
are
invited
to
christ
that
they
may
hope
to
be
saved
by
the
power
of
god
the
same
thing
is
alluded
to
in
another
prayer
where
the
whole
church
implores
the
mercy
of
god
let
thy
hand
be
upon
the
man
of
thy
right
hand
upon
the
son
of
man
whom
thou
madest
strong
for
for
though
the
author
of
the
psalm
deplores
the
dissipation
of
all
the
people
yet
he
ardently
prays
for
their
restoration
in
their
head
alone
but
when
jeremiah
after
the
people
were
driven
into
exile
the
land
laid
waste
and
all
things
apparently
ruined
bewails
the
miseries
of
the
church
he
principally
laments
that
by
the
subversion
of
the
kingdom
the
hope
of
the
faithful
was
cut
off
the
breath
of
our
nostrils
the
anointed
of
the
lord
was
taken
in
their
pits
of
whom
we
said
under
his
shadow
we
shall
live
among
the
hence
it
is
sufficiently
evident
that
since
god
can
not
be
propitious
to
mankind
but
through
the
mediator
christ
was
always
exhibited
to
the
holy
fathers
under
the
law
as
the
object
to
which
they
should
direct
their
faith
iii
now
when
consolation
is
promised
in
affliction
but
especially
when
the
deliverance
of
the
church
is
described
the
standard
of
confidence
and
hope
is
erected
in
christ
alone
thou
wentest
forth
for
the
salvation
of
thy
people
even
for
salvation
with
thine
anointed
says
habakkuk
and
whenever
the
prophets
mention
the
restoration
of
the
church
they
recall
the
people
to
the
promise
given
to
david
concerning
the
perpetuity
of
his
kingdom
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
otherwise
there
would
be
no
stability
in
the
covenant
to
this
refers
the
memorable
answer
of
isaiah
for
when
he
saw
that
his
declaration
concerning
the
raising
of
the
siege
and
the
present
deliverance
of
jerusalem
was
rejected
by
that
unbelieving
king
ahaz
he
makes
rather
an
abrupt
transition
to
the
messiah
behold
a
virgin
shall
conceive
and
bear
a
son
indirectly
suggesting
that
although
the
king
and
the
people
in
their
perverseness
rejected
the
promise
which
had
been
given
them
as
though
they
would
purposely
labour
to
invalidate
the
truth
of
god
yet
that
his
covenant
would
not
be
frustrated
but
that
the
redeemer
should
come
at
his
appointed
time
finally
all
the
prophets
in
order
to
display
the
divine
mercy
were
constantly
careful
to
exhibit
to
view
that
kingdom
of
david
from
which
redemption
and
eternal
salvation
were
to
proceed
thus
isaiah
i
will
make
an
everlasting
covenant
with
you
even
the
sure
mercies
of
david
behold
i
have
given
him
for
a
witness
to
the
people
because
in
desperate
circumstances
the
faithful
could
have
no
hope
any
otherwise
than
by
his
interposition
as
a
witness
that
god
would
be
merciful
to
them
thus
also
jeremiah
to
comfort
them
who
were
in
despair
says
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
raise
unto
david
a
righteous
branch
in
his
days
judah
shall
be
saved
and
israel
shall
dwell
and
ezekiel
i
will
set
up
one
shepherd
over
them
and
he
shall
feed
them
even
my
servant
david
and
i
the
lord
will
be
their
god
and
my
servant
david
a
prince
among
them
and
i
will
make
with
them
a
covenant
of
again
in
another
place
having
treated
of
their
incredible
renovation
he
says
david
my
servant
shall
be
king
over
them
and
they
all
shall
have
one
shepherd
moreover
i
will
make
a
covenant
of
peace
with
them
it
shall
be
an
everlasting
covenant
with
i
select
a
few
passages
out
of
many
because
i
only
wish
to
apprize
the
reader
that
the
hope
of
the
pious
has
never
been
placed
any
where
but
in
christ
all
the
other
prophets
also
uniformly
speak
the
same
language
as
hosea
then
shall
the
children
of
judah
and
the
children
of
israel
be
gathered
together
and
appoint
themselves
one
and
in
a
subsequent
chapter
he
is
still
more
explicit
the
children
of
israel
shall
return
and
seek
the
lord
their
god
and
david
their
micah
also
discoursing
on
the
return
of
the
people
expressly
declares
their
king
shall
pass
before
them
and
the
lord
on
the
head
of
thus
amos
intending
to
predict
the
restoration
of
the
people
says
in
that
day
i
will
raise
up
the
tabernacle
of
david
that
is
fallen
and
close
up
the
breaches
thereof
and
i
will
raise
up
his
this
implies
that
the
only
standard
of
salvation
was
the
restoration
of
the
regal
dignity
in
the
family
of
david
which
was
accomplished
in
christ
zechariah
therefore
living
nearer
to
the
time
of
the
manifestation
of
christ
more
openly
exclaims
rejoice
greatly
o
daughter
of
zion
shout
o
daughter
of
jerusalem
behold
thy
king
cometh
unto
thee
he
is
just
and
having
this
corresponds
with
a
passage
from
a
psalm
already
cited
the
lord
is
the
saving
strength
of
his
anointed
save
thy
people
where
salvation
is
extended
from
the
head
to
the
whole
body
iv
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
the
jews
should
be
instructed
by
these
prophecies
so
that
they
might
direct
their
eyes
to
christ
whenever
they
wanted
deliverance
nor
indeed
notwithstanding
their
shameful
degeneracy
could
the
memory
of
this
general
principle
ever
be
god
would
be
the
deliverer
of
the
church
by
the
hand
of
christ
according
to
his
promise
to
david
and
that
in
this
manner
the
covenant
of
grace
in
which
god
had
adopted
his
elect
would
at
length
be
confirmed
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
when
christ
a
little
before
his
death
entered
into
jerusalem
that
song
was
heard
from
the
mouths
of
children
hosanna
to
the
son
of
for
the
subject
of
their
song
appears
to
have
been
derived
from
a
sentiment
generally
received
and
avowed
by
the
people
that
there
remained
to
them
no
other
pledge
of
the
mercy
of
god
but
in
the
advent
of
the
redeemer
for
this
reason
christ
commands
his
disciples
to
believe
in
him
that
they
may
distinctly
and
perfectly
believe
in
god
ye
believe
in
god
believe
also
in
for
though
strictly
speaking
faith
ascends
from
christ
to
the
father
yet
he
suggests
that
though
it
were
even
fixed
on
god
yet
it
would
gradually
decline
unless
he
interposed
to
preserve
its
stability
the
majesty
of
god
is
otherwise
far
above
the
reach
of
mortals
who
are
like
worms
crawling
upon
the
earth
wherefore
though
i
do
not
reject
that
common
observation
that
god
is
the
object
of
faith
yet
i
consider
it
as
requiring
some
correction
for
it
is
not
without
reason
that
christ
is
called
the
image
of
the
invisible
god
but
by
this
appellation
we
are
reminded
that
unless
god
reveal
himself
to
us
in
christ
we
can
not
have
that
knowledge
of
him
which
is
necessary
to
salvation
for
although
among
the
jews
the
scribes
had
by
false
glosses
obscured
the
declarations
of
the
prophets
concerning
the
redeemer
yet
christ
assumed
it
for
granted
as
if
allowed
by
common
consent
that
there
was
no
other
remedy
for
the
confusion
into
which
the
jews
had
fallen
nor
any
other
mode
of
deliverance
for
the
church
but
the
exhibition
of
the
mediator
there
was
not
indeed
such
a
general
knowledge
as
there
ought
to
have
been
of
the
principle
taught
by
paul
that
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
but
the
truth
and
certainty
of
this
evidently
appears
both
from
the
law
itself
and
from
the
prophets
i
am
not
yet
treating
of
faith
there
will
be
a
more
suitable
place
for
that
subject
in
another
part
of
the
work
only
let
this
be
well
fixed
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
that
the
first
step
to
piety
is
to
know
that
god
is
our
father
to
protect
govern
and
support
us
till
he
gathers
us
into
the
eternal
inheritance
of
his
kingdom
that
hence
it
is
plain
as
we
have
before
asserted
that
there
can
be
no
saving
knowledge
of
god
without
christ
and
consequently
that
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
he
has
always
been
manifested
to
all
the
elect
that
they
might
look
to
him
and
repose
all
their
confidence
in
him
in
this
sense
irenæus
says
that
the
father
who
is
infinite
in
himself
becomes
finite
in
the
son
because
he
has
accommodated
himself
to
our
capacity
that
he
may
not
overwhelm
our
minds
with
the
infinity
of
his
glory
and
fanatics
not
considering
this
pervert
a
useful
observation
into
an
impious
reverie
as
though
there
were
in
christ
merely
a
portion
of
deity
an
emanation
from
the
infinite
perfection
whereas
the
sole
meaning
of
that
writer
is
that
god
is
apprehended
in
christ
and
in
him
alone
the
assertion
of
john
has
been
verified
in
all
ages
whosoever
denieth
the
son
the
same
hath
not
the
for
though
many
in
ancient
times
gloried
in
being
worshippers
of
the
supreme
deity
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
yet
because
they
had
no
mediator
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
have
any
real
acquaintance
with
the
mercy
of
god
or
persuasion
that
he
was
their
father
therefore
as
they
did
not
hold
the
head
that
is
christ
all
their
knowledge
of
god
was
obscure
and
unsettled
whence
it
came
to
pass
that
degenerating
at
length
into
gross
and
vile
superstitions
they
betrayed
their
ignorance
like
the
turks
in
modern
times
who
though
they
boast
of
having
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
for
their
god
yet
only
substitute
an
idol
instead
of
the
true
god
as
long
as
they
remain
enemies
to
christ
chapter
vii
the
law
given
not
to
confine
the
ancient
people
to
itself
but
to
encourage
their
hope
of
salvation
in
christ
till
the
time
of
his
coming
from
the
deduction
we
have
made
it
may
easily
be
inferred
that
the
law
was
superadded
about
four
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
abraham
not
to
draw
away
the
attention
of
the
chosen
people
from
christ
but
rather
to
keep
their
minds
waiting
for
his
advent
to
inflame
their
desires
and
confirm
their
expectations
that
they
might
not
be
discouraged
by
so
long
a
delay
by
the
word
i
intend
not
only
the
decalogue
which
prescribes
the
rule
of
a
pious
and
righteous
life
but
the
form
of
religion
delivered
from
god
by
the
hands
of
moses
for
moses
was
not
made
a
legislator
to
abolish
the
blessing
promised
to
the
seed
of
abraham
on
the
contrary
we
see
him
on
every
occasion
reminding
the
jews
of
that
gracious
covenant
made
with
their
fathers
to
which
they
were
heirs
as
though
the
object
of
his
mission
had
been
to
renew
it
it
was
very
clearly
manifested
in
the
ceremonies
for
what
could
be
more
vain
or
frivolous
than
for
men
to
offer
the
fetid
stench
arising
from
the
fat
of
cattle
in
order
to
reconcile
themselves
to
god
or
to
resort
to
any
aspersion
of
water
or
of
blood
to
cleanse
themselves
from
pollution
in
short
the
whole
legal
worship
if
it
be
considered
in
itself
and
contain
no
shadows
and
figures
of
correspondent
truths
will
appear
perfectly
ridiculous
wherefore
it
is
not
without
reason
that
both
in
the
speech
of
stephen
and
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
that
passage
is
so
carefully
stated
in
which
god
commands
moses
to
make
all
things
pertaining
to
the
tabernacle
according
to
the
pattern
showed
to
him
in
the
for
unless
there
had
been
some
spiritual
design
to
which
they
were
directed
the
jews
would
have
laboured
to
no
purpose
in
these
observances
as
the
gentiles
did
in
their
mummeries
profane
men
who
have
never
seriously
devoted
themselves
to
the
pursuit
of
piety
have
not
patience
to
hear
of
such
various
rites
they
not
only
wonder
why
god
should
weary
his
ancient
people
with
such
a
mass
of
ceremonies
but
they
even
despise
and
deride
them
as
puerile
and
ludicrous
this
arises
from
inattention
to
the
end
of
the
legal
figures
from
which
if
those
figures
be
separated
they
must
be
condemned
as
vain
and
useless
but
the
pattern
which
is
mentioned
shows
that
god
commanded
the
sacrifices
not
with
a
design
to
occupy
his
worshippers
in
terrestrial
exercises
but
rather
that
he
might
elevate
their
minds
to
sublimer
objects
this
may
be
likewise
evinced
by
his
nature
for
as
he
is
a
spirit
he
is
pleased
with
none
but
spiritual
worship
testimonies
of
this
truth
may
be
found
in
the
numerous
passages
of
the
prophets
in
which
they
reprove
the
stupidity
of
the
jews
for
supposing
that
sacrifices
possess
any
real
value
in
the
sight
of
god
do
they
mean
to
derogate
from
the
law
not
at
all
but
being
true
interpreters
of
it
they
designed
by
this
method
to
direct
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
that
point
from
which
the
multitude
were
wandering
now
from
the
grace
offered
to
the
jews
it
is
inferred
as
a
certain
truth
that
the
law
was
not
irrespective
of
christ
for
moses
mentioned
to
them
this
end
of
their
adoption
that
they
might
be
unto
god
a
kingdom
of
priests
which
could
not
be
attained
without
a
greater
and
more
excellent
reconciliation
than
could
arise
from
the
blood
of
beasts
for
what
is
more
improbable
than
that
the
sons
of
adam
who
by
hereditary
contagion
are
all
born
the
slaves
of
sin
should
be
exalted
to
regal
dignity
and
thus
become
partakers
of
the
glory
of
god
unless
such
an
eminent
blessing
proceeded
from
some
other
source
than
themselves
how
also
could
the
right
of
the
priesthood
remain
among
them
the
pollution
of
whose
crimes
rendered
them
abominable
to
god
unless
they
had
been
consecrated
in
a
holy
head
wherefore
peter
makes
a
beautiful
application
of
this
observation
of
moses
suggesting
that
the
plenitude
of
that
grace
of
which
the
jews
enjoyed
a
taste
under
the
law
is
exhibited
in
christ
ye
are
says
he
a
chosen
generation
a
royal
this
application
of
the
words
tends
to
show
that
they
to
whom
christ
has
appeared
under
the
gospel
have
obtained
more
than
their
forefathers
because
they
are
all
invested
with
sacerdotal
and
regal
honours
that
in
a
dependence
on
their
mediator
they
may
venture
to
come
boldly
into
the
presence
of
god
ii
and
here
it
must
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
the
kingdom
which
at
length
was
erected
in
the
family
of
david
is
a
part
of
the
law
and
comprised
under
the
ministry
of
moses
whence
it
follows
that
both
in
the
posterity
of
david
and
in
the
whole
levitical
tribe
as
in
a
twofold
mirror
christ
was
exhibited
to
the
view
of
his
ancient
people
for
as
i
have
just
observed
it
was
otherwise
impossible
that
in
the
divine
view
they
should
be
kings
and
priests
who
were
the
slaves
of
sin
and
death
and
polluted
by
their
own
corruptions
hence
appears
the
truth
of
the
assertion
of
paul
that
the
jews
were
subject
as
it
were
to
the
authority
of
a
schoolmaster
till
the
advent
of
that
seed
for
whose
sake
the
promise
was
given
for
christ
being
not
yet
familiarly
discovered
they
were
like
children
whose
imbecility
could
not
yet
bear
the
full
knowledge
of
heavenly
things
but
how
they
were
led
to
christ
by
the
ceremonies
has
been
already
stated
and
may
be
better
learned
from
the
testimonies
of
the
prophets
for
although
they
were
obliged
every
day
to
approach
god
with
new
sacrifices
in
order
to
appease
him
yet
isaiah
promises
them
the
expiation
of
all
their
transgressions
by
a
single
sacrifice
which
is
confirmed
by
daniel
the
priests
chosen
from
the
tribe
of
levi
used
to
enter
into
the
sanctuary
but
concerning
that
one
priest
it
was
once
said
that
he
was
divinely
chosen
with
an
oath
to
be
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
there
was
then
an
unction
of
visible
oil
but
daniel
from
his
vision
foretells
an
unction
of
a
different
kind
but
not
to
insist
on
many
proofs
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
from
the
fourth
chapter
to
the
eleventh
demonstrates
in
a
manner
sufficiently
copious
and
clear
that
irrespective
of
christ
all
the
ceremonies
of
the
law
are
worthless
and
vain
and
in
regard
to
the
decalogue
we
should
attend
to
the
declaration
of
paul
that
christ
is
the
end
of
the
law
for
righteousness
to
every
one
that
believeth
and
also
that
christ
is
the
spirit
who
gives
life
to
the
otherwise
dead
letter
for
in
the
former
passage
he
signifies
that
righteousness
is
taught
in
vain
by
the
precepts
till
christ
bestows
it
both
by
a
gratuitous
imputation
and
by
the
spirit
of
regeneration
wherefore
he
justly
denominates
christ
the
completion
or
end
of
the
law
for
we
should
derive
no
benefit
from
a
knowledge
of
what
god
requires
of
us
unless
we
were
succoured
by
christ
when
labouring
and
oppressed
under
its
yoke
and
intolerable
burden
in
another
place
he
states
that
the
law
was
added
because
of
transgressions
that
is
to
humble
men
by
convicting
them
of
being
the
causes
of
their
own
condemnation
now
this
being
the
true
and
only
preparation
for
seeking
christ
the
various
declarations
which
he
makes
are
in
perfect
unison
with
each
other
but
as
he
was
then
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
erroneous
teachers
who
pretended
that
we
merit
righteousness
by
the
works
of
the
law
order
to
refute
their
error
he
was
sometimes
obliged
to
use
the
term
in
a
more
restricted
sense
as
merely
preceptive
although
it
was
otherwise
connected
with
the
covenant
of
gratuitous
adoption
iii
but
it
is
worthy
of
a
little
inquiry
how
we
are
rendered
more
inexcusable
by
the
instructions
of
the
moral
law
in
order
that
a
sense
of
our
guilt
may
excite
us
to
supplicate
for
pardon
if
it
be
true
that
the
law
displays
a
perfection
of
righteousness
it
also
follows
that
the
complete
observation
of
it
is
in
the
sight
of
god
a
perfect
righteousness
in
which
a
man
would
be
esteemed
and
reputed
righteous
at
the
tribunal
of
heaven
wherefore
moses
when
he
had
promulgated
the
law
hesitated
not
to
call
heaven
and
earth
to
record
that
he
had
proposed
to
the
israelites
life
and
death
good
and
evil
nor
can
we
deny
that
the
reward
of
eternal
life
awaits
a
righteous
obedience
to
the
law
according
to
the
divine
promise
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
proper
to
examine
whether
we
perform
that
obedience
the
merit
of
which
can
warrant
our
confident
expectation
of
that
reward
for
how
unimportant
is
it
to
discover
that
the
reward
of
eternal
life
depends
on
the
observance
of
the
law
unless
we
also
ascertain
whether
it
be
possible
for
us
to
arrive
at
eternal
life
in
that
way
but
in
this
point
the
weakness
of
the
law
is
manifest
for
as
none
of
us
are
found
to
observe
the
law
we
are
excluded
from
the
promises
of
life
and
fall
entirely
under
the
curse
i
am
now
showing
not
only
what
does
happen
but
what
necessarily
must
happen
for
the
doctrine
of
the
law
being
far
above
human
ability
man
may
view
the
promises
indeed
from
a
distance
but
can
not
gather
any
fruit
from
them
it
only
remains
for
him
from
their
goodness
to
form
a
truer
estimate
of
his
own
misery
while
he
reflects
that
all
hope
of
salvation
is
cut
off
and
that
he
is
in
imminent
danger
of
death
on
the
other
hand
we
are
urged
with
terrible
sanctions
which
bind
not
a
few
of
us
but
every
individual
of
mankind
they
urge
i
say
and
pursue
us
with
inexorable
rigour
so
that
in
the
law
we
see
nothing
but
present
death
iv
therefore
if
we
direct
our
views
exclusively
to
the
law
the
effects
upon
our
minds
will
only
be
despondency
confusion
and
despair
since
it
condemns
and
curses
us
all
and
keeps
us
far
from
that
blessedness
which
it
proposes
to
them
who
observe
it
does
the
lord
then
you
will
say
in
this
case
do
nothing
but
mock
us
for
how
little
does
it
differ
from
mockery
to
exhibit
a
hope
of
felicity
to
invite
and
exhort
to
it
to
declare
that
it
is
ready
for
our
reception
whilst
the
way
to
it
is
closed
and
inaccessible
i
reply
although
the
promises
of
the
law
being
conditional
depend
on
a
perfect
obedience
to
the
law
which
can
nowhere
be
found
yet
they
have
not
been
given
in
vain
for
when
we
have
learned
that
they
will
be
vain
and
inefficacious
to
us
unless
god
embrace
us
with
his
gratuitous
goodness
without
any
regard
to
our
works
and
unless
we
have
also
embraced
by
faith
that
goodness
as
exhibited
to
us
in
the
gospel
these
promises
are
not
without
their
use
even
with
the
condition
annexed
to
them
for
then
he
gratuitously
confers
every
thing
upon
us
so
that
he
adds
this
also
to
the
number
of
his
favours
that
not
rejecting
our
imperfect
obedience
but
pardoning
its
deficiencies
he
gives
us
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
the
legal
promises
just
as
if
we
had
fulfilled
the
condition
ourselves
but
as
we
shall
more
fully
discuss
this
question
when
we
treat
of
the
justification
of
faith
we
shall
pursue
it
no
further
at
present
our
assertion
respecting
the
impossibility
of
observing
the
law
must
be
briefly
explained
and
proved
for
it
is
generally
esteemed
a
very
absurd
sentiment
so
that
jerome
has
not
scrupled
to
denounce
it
as
accursed
what
was
the
opinion
of
jerome
i
regard
not
let
us
inquire
what
is
truth
i
shall
not
here
enter
into
a
long
discussion
of
the
various
species
of
possibility
i
call
that
impossible
which
has
never
happened
yet
and
which
is
prevented
by
the
ordination
and
decree
of
god
from
ever
happening
in
future
if
we
inquire
from
the
remotest
period
of
antiquity
i
assert
that
there
never
has
existed
a
saint
who
surrounded
with
a
body
of
death
could
attain
to
such
a
degree
of
love
as
to
love
god
with
all
his
heart
with
all
his
soul
and
with
all
his
mind
and
moreover
that
there
never
has
been
one
who
was
not
the
subject
of
some
inordinate
desire
who
can
deny
this
i
know
indeed
what
sort
of
saints
the
folly
of
superstition
imagines
to
itself
such
as
almost
excel
even
the
angels
of
heaven
in
purity
but
such
an
imagination
is
repugnant
both
to
scripture
and
to
the
dictates
of
experience
i
assert
also
that
no
man
who
shall
exist
in
future
will
reach
the
standard
of
true
perfection
unless
released
from
the
burden
of
the
body
this
is
established
by
clear
testimonies
of
scripture
solomon
says
there
is
not
a
just
man
upon
earth
that
doeth
good
and
sinneth
david
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
job
in
many
passages
affirms
the
same
thing
but
paul
most
plainly
of
all
that
the
flesh
lusteth
against
the
spirit
and
the
spirit
against
the
nor
does
he
prove
that
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
by
any
other
reason
but
because
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
evidently
suggesting
and
even
taking
it
for
granted
that
no
one
can
continue
in
them
now
whatever
is
predicted
in
the
scriptures
must
be
considered
as
perpetual
and
even
as
necessary
with
a
similar
fallacy
augustine
used
to
be
teased
by
the
pelagians
who
maintained
that
it
is
an
injury
to
god
to
say
that
he
commands
more
than
the
faithful
through
his
grace
are
able
to
perform
to
avoid
their
cavil
he
admitted
that
the
lord
might
if
he
chose
exalt
a
mortal
man
to
the
purity
of
angels
but
that
he
neither
had
ever
done
it
nor
would
ever
do
it
because
he
had
declared
otherwise
in
the
scriptures
this
i
do
not
deny
but
i
add
that
it
is
absurd
to
dispute
concerning
the
power
of
god
in
opposition
to
his
veracity
and
that
therefore
it
affords
no
room
for
cavilling
when
any
one
maintains
that
to
be
impossible
which
the
scriptures
declare
will
never
happen
but
if
the
dispute
be
about
the
term
the
lord
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
of
his
disciples
who
then
can
be
saved
says
with
men
this
is
impossible
but
with
god
all
things
are
augustine
contends
with
a
very
powerful
argument
that
in
this
flesh
we
never
render
to
god
the
legitimate
love
which
we
owe
to
him
love
says
he
is
an
effect
of
knowledge
so
that
no
man
can
perfectly
love
god
who
has
not
first
a
complete
knowledge
of
his
goodness
during
our
pilgrimage
in
this
world
we
see
through
an
obscure
medium
the
consequence
of
this
then
is
that
our
love
is
it
ought
therefore
to
be
admitted
without
controversy
that
it
is
impossible
in
this
carnal
state
to
fulfil
the
law
if
we
consider
the
impotence
of
our
nature
as
will
elsewhere
be
proved
also
from
paul
vi
but
for
the
better
elucidation
of
the
subject
let
us
state
in
a
compendious
order
the
office
and
use
of
what
is
called
the
moral
law
it
is
contained
as
far
as
i
understand
it
in
these
three
points
the
first
is
that
while
it
discovers
the
righteousness
of
god
that
is
the
only
righteousness
which
is
acceptable
to
god
it
warns
every
one
of
his
own
unrighteousness
places
it
beyond
all
doubt
convicts
and
condemns
him
for
it
is
necessary
that
man
blinded
and
inebriated
with
should
thus
be
driven
into
a
knowledge
of
himself
and
a
confession
of
his
own
imbecility
and
impurity
since
unless
his
vanity
be
evidently
reproved
he
is
inflated
with
a
foolish
confidence
in
his
strength
and
can
never
be
brought
to
perceive
its
feebleness
as
long
as
he
measures
it
by
the
rule
of
his
own
fancy
but
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
compare
it
to
the
difficulty
of
the
law
he
finds
his
insolence
and
pride
immediately
abate
for
how
great
soever
his
preconceived
opinion
of
it
he
perceives
it
immediately
pant
under
so
heavy
a
load
and
then
totter
and
at
length
fall
thus
being
instructed
under
the
tuition
of
the
law
he
lays
aside
that
arrogance
with
which
he
was
previously
blinded
he
must
also
be
cured
of
the
other
disease
of
pride
with
which
we
have
observed
he
is
afflicted
as
long
as
he
is
permitted
to
stand
in
his
own
judgment
he
substitutes
hypocrisy
instead
of
righteousness
contented
with
which
he
rises
up
with
i
know
not
what
pretended
righteousnesses
in
opposition
to
the
grace
of
god
but
when
he
is
constrained
to
examine
his
life
according
to
the
rules
of
the
law
he
no
longer
presumes
on
his
counterfeit
righteousness
but
perceives
that
he
is
at
an
infinite
distance
from
holiness
and
also
that
he
abounds
with
innumerable
vices
from
which
he
before
supposed
himself
to
be
pure
for
the
evils
of
concupiscence
are
concealed
in
such
deep
and
intricate
recesses
as
easily
to
elude
the
view
of
man
and
it
is
not
without
cause
that
the
apostle
says
i
had
not
known
lust
except
the
law
had
said
thou
shalt
not
covet
because
unless
it
be
stripped
of
its
disguises
and
brought
to
light
by
the
law
it
destroys
the
miserable
man
in
so
secret
a
manner
that
he
does
not
perceive
its
fatal
dart
vii
thus
the
law
is
like
a
mirror
in
which
we
behold
first
our
impotence
secondly
our
iniquity
which
proceeds
from
it
and
lastly
the
consequence
of
both
our
obnoxiousness
to
the
curse
just
as
a
mirror
represents
to
us
the
spots
on
our
face
for
when
a
man
is
destitute
of
power
to
practise
righteousness
he
must
necessarily
fall
into
the
habits
of
sin
and
sin
is
immediately
followed
by
the
curse
therefore
the
greater
the
transgression
of
which
the
law
convicts
us
the
more
severe
is
the
judgment
with
which
it
condemns
us
this
appears
from
the
observation
of
the
apostle
that
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
for
he
there
speaks
only
of
the
first
office
of
the
law
which
is
experienced
in
sinners
not
yet
regenerated
the
same
sentiment
is
conveyed
in
the
following
passages
that
the
law
entered
that
the
offence
might
abound
and
that
it
is
therefore
the
ministration
of
death
which
worketh
wrath
and
for
iniquity
undoubtedly
increases
more
and
more
in
proportion
to
the
clearness
of
that
sense
of
sin
which
strikes
the
conscience
because
to
transgression
of
the
law
there
is
then
added
contumacy
against
the
lawgiver
it
remains
therefore
that
the
law
arm
the
divine
wrath
against
the
sinner
for
of
itself
it
can
only
accuse
condemn
and
destroy
and
as
augustine
says
if
we
have
not
the
spirit
of
grace
the
law
serves
only
to
convict
and
slay
us
but
this
assertion
neither
reflects
dishonour
on
the
law
nor
at
all
derogates
from
its
excellence
certainly
if
our
will
were
wholly
conformed
to
the
law
and
disposed
to
obey
it
the
mere
knowledge
of
it
would
evidently
be
sufficient
to
salvation
but
since
our
carnal
and
corrupt
nature
is
in
a
state
of
hostility
against
the
spirituality
of
the
divine
law
and
not
amended
by
its
discipline
it
follows
that
the
law
which
was
given
for
salvation
if
it
could
have
found
adequate
attention
becomes
an
occasion
of
sin
and
death
for
since
we
are
all
convicted
of
having
transgressed
it
the
more
clearly
it
displays
the
righteousness
of
god
so
on
the
contrary
the
more
it
detects
our
iniquity
and
the
more
certainly
it
confirms
the
reward
of
life
and
salvation
reserved
for
the
righteous
so
much
the
more
certain
it
makes
the
perdition
of
the
wicked
these
expressions
therefore
are
so
far
from
being
dishonourable
to
the
law
that
they
serve
more
illustriously
to
recommend
the
divine
goodness
for
hence
it
really
appears
that
our
iniquity
and
depravity
prevent
us
from
enjoying
that
blessed
life
which
is
revealed
to
all
men
in
the
law
hence
the
grace
of
god
which
succours
us
without
the
assistance
of
the
law
is
rendered
sweeter
and
his
mercy
which
confers
it
on
us
more
amiable
from
which
we
learn
that
he
is
never
wearied
with
repeating
his
blessings
and
loading
us
with
new
favours
viii
but
though
the
iniquity
and
condemnation
of
us
all
are
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
law
this
is
not
done
at
least
if
we
properly
profit
by
it
in
order
to
make
us
sink
into
despair
and
fall
over
the
precipice
of
despondency
it
is
true
that
the
wicked
are
thus
confounded
by
it
but
this
is
occasioned
by
the
obstinacy
of
their
hearts
with
the
children
of
god
its
instructions
must
terminate
in
a
different
manner
the
apostle
indeed
declares
that
we
are
all
condemned
by
the
sentence
of
the
law
that
every
mouth
may
be
stopped
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
yet
the
same
apostle
elsewhere
informs
us
that
god
hath
concluded
them
all
in
unbelief
not
that
he
might
destroy
or
suffer
all
to
perish
but
that
he
might
have
mercy
upon
all
that
is
that
leaving
their
foolish
opinion
of
their
own
strength
they
may
know
that
they
stand
and
are
supported
only
by
the
power
of
god
that
being
naked
and
destitute
they
may
resort
for
assistance
to
his
mercy
recline
themselves
wholly
upon
it
hide
themselves
entirely
in
it
and
embrace
it
alone
for
righteousness
and
merits
since
it
is
offered
in
christ
to
all
who
with
true
faith
implore
it
and
expect
it
for
in
the
precepts
of
the
law
god
appears
only
on
the
one
hand
as
the
rewarder
of
perfect
righteousness
of
which
we
are
all
destitute
and
on
the
other
as
the
severe
judge
of
transgressions
but
in
christ
his
face
shines
with
a
plenitude
of
grace
and
lenity
even
towards
miserable
and
unworthy
sinners
ix
of
making
use
of
the
law
to
implore
the
assistance
of
god
augustine
frequently
treats
as
when
he
writes
to
hilary
the
law
gives
commands
in
order
that
endeavouring
to
perform
them
and
being
wearied
through
our
infirmity
under
the
law
we
may
learn
to
pray
for
the
assistance
of
also
to
asellius
the
utility
of
the
law
is
to
convince
man
of
his
own
infirmity
and
to
compel
him
to
pray
for
the
gracious
remedy
provided
in
also
to
innocentius
romanus
the
law
commands
grace

the
law
was
given
to
convict
you
that
being
convicted
you
might
fear
that
fearing
you
might
pray
for
pardon
and
not
presume
on
your
own
again
the
end
for
which
the
law
was
given
was
to
diminish
that
which
was
great
to
demonstrate
that
you
have
of
yourself
no
ability
to
work
righteousness
that
thus
being
poor
indigent
and
destitute
you
might
have
recourse
to
grace
for
afterwards
he
addresses
himself
to
god
thus
do
o
lord
thus
do
o
merciful
lord
command
that
which
can
not
be
performed
even
command
that
which
can
not
be
performed
without
thy
grace
that
when
men
can
not
perform
it
in
their
own
strength
every
mouth
may
be
stopped
and
no
man
appear
great
in
his
own
estimation
let
all
men
be
mean
and
let
all
the
world
be
proved
guilty
before
but
i
am
not
wise
in
collecting
so
many
testimonies
when
this
holy
man
has
written
a
treatise
expressly
on
this
subject
which
he
has
entitled
spiritu
et
on
the
spirit
and
letter
the
second
use
of
the
law
he
does
not
so
clearly
describe
either
because
he
knew
that
it
depends
on
the
first
or
because
he
did
not
so
fully
understand
it
or
because
he
wanted
words
to
explain
it
with
distinctness
and
perspicuity
adequate
to
his
ideas
of
it
yet
this
first
office
of
the
law
is
not
confined
to
the
pious
but
extends
also
to
the
reprobate
for
though
they
do
not
with
the
children
of
god
advance
so
far
as
after
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
to
be
renewed
and
to
flourish
again
in
the
inner
man
but
confounded
with
the
first
horrors
of
conscience
remain
in
despair
yet
they
contribute
to
manifest
the
equity
of
the
divine
judgment
by
their
consciences
being
agitated
with
such
violent
emotions
for
they
are
always
desirous
of
cavilling
against
the
judgment
of
god
but
now
while
it
is
not
yet
manifested
they
are
nevertheless
so
confounded
with
the
testimony
of
the
law
and
of
their
own
conscience
that
they
betray
in
themselves
what
they
have
deserved
x
the
second
office
of
the
law
is
to
cause
those
who
unless
constrained
feel
no
concern
for
justice
and
rectitude
when
they
hear
its
terrible
sanctions
to
be
at
least
restrained
by
a
fear
of
its
penalties
and
they
are
restrained
not
because
it
internally
influences
or
affects
their
minds
but
because
being
chained
as
it
were
they
refrain
from
external
acts
and
repress
their
depravity
within
them
which
otherwise
they
would
have
wantonly
discharged
this
makes
them
neither
better
nor
more
righteous
in
the
divine
view
for
although
being
prevented
either
by
fear
or
by
shame
they
dare
not
execute
what
their
minds
have
contrived
nor
openly
discover
the
fury
of
their
passions
yet
their
hearts
are
not
disposed
to
fear
and
obey
god
and
the
more
they
restrain
themselves
the
more
violently
they
are
inflamed
within
they
ferment
they
boil
ready
to
break
out
into
any
external
acts
if
they
were
not
prevented
by
this
dread
of
the
law
and
not
only
so
they
also
inveterately
hate
the
law
itself
and
execrate
god
the
lawgiver
so
that
if
they
could
they
would
wish
to
annihilate
him
whom
they
can
not
bear
either
in
commanding
that
which
is
right
or
in
punishing
the
despisers
of
his
majesty
in
some
indeed
this
state
of
mind
is
more
evident
in
others
more
concealed
but
it
is
really
the
case
of
all
who
are
yet
unregenerate
that
they
are
induced
to
attend
to
the
law
not
by
a
voluntary
submission
but
with
reluctance
and
resistance
only
by
the
violence
of
fear
but
yet
this
constrained
and
extorted
righteousness
is
necessary
to
the
community
whose
public
tranquillity
is
provided
for
by
god
in
this
instance
while
he
prevents
all
things
being
involved
in
confusion
which
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
all
men
were
permitted
to
pursue
their
own
inclinations
moreover
it
is
useful
even
to
the
children
of
god
to
be
exercised
by
its
discipline
before
their
vocation
while
they
are
destitute
of
the
spirit
of
sanctification
and
are
absorbed
in
carnal
folly
for
when
the
dread
of
divine
vengeance
restrains
them
even
from
external
licentiousness
although
their
minds
being
not
yet
subdued
they
make
but
a
slow
progress
at
present
yet
they
are
in
some
measure
accustomed
to
bear
the
yoke
of
righteousness
so
that
when
they
are
called
they
may
not
be
entirely
unaccustomed
to
its
discipline
as
a
thing
altogether
unknown
to
this
office
of
the
law
the
apostle
appears
particularly
to
have
referred
when
he
says
that
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
man
but
for
the
lawless
and
disobedient
for
the
ungodly
and
for
sinners
for
unholy
and
profane
for
murderers
of
fathers
and
murderers
of
mothers
for
manslayers
for
whoremongers
for
them
that
defile
themselves
with
mankind
for
for
liars
for
perjured
persons
and
if
there
be
any
other
thing
that
is
contrary
to
sound
for
he
here
signifies
that
it
restrains
the
violence
of
the
carnal
desires
which
would
otherwise
indulge
themselves
in
the
most
unbounded
licentiousness
xi
but
we
may
apply
to
both
what
he
elsewhere
asserts
that
to
the
jews
the
law
was
a
schoolmaster
to
bring
them
to
christ
for
there
are
two
kinds
of
persons
who
are
led
to
christ
by
its
discipline
some
whom
we
mentioned
in
the
first
place
from
too
much
confidence
either
in
their
own
strength
or
in
their
own
righteousness
are
unfit
to
receive
the
grace
of
christ
till
they
have
first
been
stripped
of
every
thing
the
law
therefore
reduces
them
to
humility
by
a
knowledge
of
their
own
misery
that
thus
they
may
be
prepared
to
pray
for
that
of
which
they
before
supposed
themselves
not
destitute
others
need
a
bridle
to
restrain
them
lest
they
abandon
themselves
to
carnal
licentiousness
to
such
a
degree
as
wholly
to
depart
from
all
practice
of
righteousness
for
where
the
spirit
does
not
yet
reign
there
is
sometimes
such
a
violent
ebullition
of
the
passions
as
to
occasion
great
danger
of
the
soul
that
is
under
their
influence
being
swallowed
up
in
forgetfulness
and
contempt
of
god
which
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
the
lord
did
not
provide
this
remedy
against
it
those
therefore
whom
he
has
destined
to
the
inheritance
of
his
kingdom
if
he
do
not
immediately
regenerate
them
he
keeps
under
fear
by
the
works
of
the
law
till
the
time
of
his
visitation
not
that
chaste
and
pure
fear
which
ought
to
be
felt
by
his
children
but
a
fear
which
is
nevertheless
useful
to
train
them
according
to
their
capacity
to
true
piety
of
this
we
have
so
many
proofs
that
there
is
no
need
to
adduce
any
example
for
all
who
have
lived
for
a
considerable
time
in
ignorance
of
god
will
confess
it
to
have
been
their
experience
that
they
were
constrained
by
the
law
to
a
certain
kind
of
fear
and
reverence
of
god
till
being
regenerated
by
his
spirit
they
began
to
love
him
from
their
hearts
xii
the
third
use
of
the
law
which
is
the
principal
one
and
which
is
more
nearly
connected
with
the
proper
end
of
it
relates
to
the
faithful
in
whose
hearts
the
spirit
of
god
already
lives
and
reigns
for
although
the
law
is
inscribed
and
engraven
on
their
hearts
by
the
finger
of
god
is
although
they
are
so
excited
and
animated
by
the
direction
of
the
spirit
that
they
desire
to
obey
god
they
derive
a
twofold
advantage
from
the
law
for
they
find
it
an
excellent
instrument
to
give
them
from
day
to
day
a
better
and
more
certain
understanding
of
the
divine
will
to
which
they
aspire
and
to
confirm
them
in
the
knowledge
of
it
as
though
a
servant
be
already
influenced
by
the
strongest
desire
of
gaining
the
approbation
of
his
master
yet
it
is
necessary
for
him
carefully
to
inquire
and
observe
the
orders
of
his
master
in
order
to
conform
to
them
nor
let
any
one
of
us
exempt
himself
from
this
necessity
for
no
man
has
already
acquired
so
much
wisdom
that
he
could
not
by
the
daily
instruction
of
the
law
make
new
advances
into
a
purer
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
in
the
next
place
as
we
need
not
only
instruction
but
also
exhortation
the
servant
of
god
will
derive
this
further
advantage
from
the
law
by
frequent
meditation
on
it
he
will
be
excited
to
obedience
he
will
be
confirmed
in
it
and
restrained
from
the
slippery
path
of
transgression
for
in
this
manner
should
the
saints
stimulate
themselves
because
with
whatever
alacrity
they
labour
for
the
righteousness
of
god
according
to
the
spirit
yet
they
are
always
burdened
with
the
indolence
of
the
flesh
which
prevents
their
proceeding
with
due
promptitude
to
this
flesh
the
law
serves
as
a
whip
urging
it
like
a
dull
and
tardy
animal
forwards
to
its
work
and
even
to
the
spiritual
man
who
is
not
yet
delivered
from
the
burden
of
the
flesh
it
will
be
a
perpetual
spur
that
will
not
permit
him
to
loiter
to
this
use
of
the
law
david
referred
when
he
celebrated
it
in
such
remarkable
encomiums
as
these
the
law
of
the
lord
is
perfect
converting
the
soul
the
statutes
of
the
lord
are
right
rejoicing
the
heart
the
commandment
of
the
lord
is
pure
enlightening
the
eyes
again
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
and
many
others
which
he
introduces
in
every
part
of
this
psalm
nor
are
these
assertions
repugnant
to
those
of
paul
in
which
he
shows
not
what
service
the
law
renders
to
the
regenerate
but
what
it
can
bestow
upon
man
merely
of
itself
whereas
the
psalmist
in
these
passages
celebrates
the
great
advantage
derived
through
the
divine
teaching
from
the
reading
of
the
law
by
those
whom
god
inspires
with
an
inward
promptitude
to
obedience
and
he
adverts
not
only
to
the
precepts
but
to
the
promise
of
grace
annexed
to
their
performance
which
alone
causes
that
which
is
bitter
to
become
sweet
for
what
would
be
less
amiable
than
the
law
if
by
demands
and
threats
it
only
distressed
the
mind
with
fear
and
harassed
it
with
terror
but
david
particularly
shows
that
in
the
law
he
discovered
the
mediator
without
whom
there
is
nothing
pleasant
or
delightful
xiii
some
unskilful
men
being
unable
to
discern
this
distinction
rashly
explode
moses
altogether
and
discard
the
two
tables
of
the
law
because
they
consider
it
improper
for
christians
to
adhere
to
a
doctrine
which
contains
the
administration
of
death
far
from
us
be
this
profane
opinion
for
moses
has
abundantly
taught
us
that
the
law
which
in
sinners
can
only
produce
death
ought
to
have
a
better
and
more
excellent
use
in
the
saints
for
just
before
his
death
he
thus
addressed
the
people
set
your
hearts
unto
all
the
words
which
i
testify
among
you
this
day
which
ye
shall
command
your
children
to
observe
to
do
all
the
words
of
this
law
for
it
is
not
a
vain
thing
for
you
because
it
is
your
but
if
no
one
can
deny
that
the
law
exhibits
a
perfect
model
of
righteousness
either
we
ought
to
have
no
rule
for
an
upright
and
just
life
or
it
is
criminal
for
us
to
deviate
from
it
for
there
are
not
many
rules
of
life
but
one
which
is
perpetually
and
immutably
the
same
wherefore
when
david
represents
the
life
of
a
righteous
man
as
spent
in
continual
meditations
on
the
law
we
must
not
refer
it
to
one
period
of
time
only
because
it
is
very
suitable
for
all
ages
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
let
us
neither
be
deterred
therefore
nor
fly
from
its
instructions
because
it
prescribes
a
holiness
far
more
complete
than
we
shall
attain
as
long
as
we
remain
in
the
prison
of
the
body
for
it
no
longer
exercises
towards
us
the
part
of
a
rigorous
exactor
only
to
be
satisfied
by
the
perfect
performance
of
every
injunction
but
in
this
perfection
to
which
it
exhorts
us
it
shows
us
a
goal
to
aim
at
which
during
the
whole
of
our
lives
would
be
equally
conducive
to
our
interest
and
consistent
with
our
duty
in
which
attempt
it
is
happy
for
us
if
we
fail
not
for
the
whole
of
this
life
is
a
course
which
when
we
have
completed
the
lord
will
grant
us
to
reach
that
goal
towards
which
at
so
great
a
distance
our
efforts
are
now
vigorously
directed
xiv
now
because
the
law
in
regard
to
the
faithful
has
the
force
of
an
exhortation
not
to
bind
their
consciences
with
a
curse
but
by
its
frequent
admonitions
to
arouse
their
indolence
and
reprove
their
imperfection
persons
when
they
design
to
express
this
liberation
from
its
curse
say
that
the
law
i
still
speak
of
the
moral
law
is
abrogated
to
the
faithful
not
that
it
no
longer
enjoins
upon
them
that
which
is
right
but
only
that
it
ceases
to
be
to
them
what
it
was
before
no
longer
terrifying
and
confounding
their
consciences
condemning
and
destroying
them
and
such
an
abrogation
of
the
law
is
clearly
taught
by
paul
it
appears
also
to
have
been
preached
by
our
lord
since
he
would
not
have
refuted
the
opinion
concerning
his
abolishing
the
law
unless
it
had
prevailed
among
the
jews
now
as
this
opinion
could
not
prevail
without
any
pretext
it
is
probable
that
it
proceeded
from
a
false
interpretation
of
his
doctrine
in
the
same
manner
as
almost
all
errors
have
usually
taken
some
colour
from
the
truth
but
lest
we
ourselves
fall
into
the
same
error
let
us
accurately
distinguish
what
is
abrogated
in
the
law
and
what
still
remains
in
force
when
the
lord
declares
that
he
came
not
to
destroy
the
law
but
to
fulfil
it
and
that
till
heaven
and
earth
shall
pass
one
jot
or
one
tittle
shall
in
no
wise
pass
from
the
law
till
all
be
fulfilled
he
sufficiently
proves
that
his
advent
would
detract
nothing
from
the
observance
of
the
law
and
with
sufficient
reason
since
the
express
end
of
his
advent
was
to
heal
the
transgressions
of
it
the
doctrine
of
the
law
remains
therefore
through
christ
inviolable
which
by
tuition
admonition
reproof
and
correction
forms
and
prepares
us
for
every
good
work
xv
the
assertions
of
paul
respecting
the
abrogation
of
the
law
evidently
relate
not
to
the
instruction
itself
but
to
the
power
of
binding
the
conscience
for
the
law
not
only
teaches
but
authoritatively
requires
obedience
to
its
commands
if
this
obedience
be
not
yielded
and
even
if
there
be
any
partial
deficiency
of
duty
it
hurls
the
thunderbolt
of
its
curse
for
this
reason
the
apostle
says
that
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
now
he
affirms
those
to
be
of
the
works
of
the
law
who
place
not
their
righteousness
in
the
remission
of
sins
by
which
we
are
released
from
the
rigour
of
the
law
he
teaches
us
therefore
that
we
must
be
released
from
the
bondage
of
the
law
unless
we
would
perish
in
misery
under
it
but
what
bondage
the
bondage
of
that
austere
and
rigid
exaction
which
remits
nothing
from
its
strictest
requirements
and
permits
no
transgression
to
pass
with
impunity
i
say
christ
in
order
to
redeem
us
from
this
curse
was
made
a
curse
for
us
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
in
the
following
chapter
indeed
he
tells
us
that
christ
was
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
but
in
the
same
sense
for
he
immediately
adds
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
what
is
this
that
we
might
not
be
oppressed
with
a
perpetual
servitude
which
would
keep
our
consciences
in
continual
distress
with
the
dread
of
death
at
the
same
time
this
truth
remains
for
ever
unshaken
that
the
law
has
sustained
no
diminution
of
its
authority
but
ought
always
to
receive
from
us
the
same
veneration
and
obedience
xvi
the
case
of
ceremonies
which
have
been
abrogated
not
as
to
their
effect
but
only
as
to
their
use
is
very
different
their
having
been
abolished
by
the
advent
of
christ
is
so
far
from
derogating
from
their
sanctity
that
it
rather
recommends
and
renders
it
more
illustrious
for
as
they
must
have
exhibited
to
the
people
in
ancient
times
a
vain
spectacle
unless
they
had
discovered
the
virtue
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
so
if
they
had
not
ceased
we
should
in
the
present
age
have
been
unable
to
discern
for
what
purpose
they
were
instituted
to
prove
therefore
that
the
observance
of
them
is
not
only
needless
but
even
injurious
paul
teaches
us
that
they
were
shadows
the
body
of
which
we
have
in
christ
we
see
then
that
the
truth
shines
with
greater
splendour
in
their
abolition
than
if
they
still
continued
to
give
a
distant
and
obscure
representation
of
christ
who
has
openly
appeared
for
this
reason
at
the
death
of
christ
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
rent
in
twain
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
because
according
to
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
the
living
and
express
image
of
the
heavenly
blessings
which
before
had
been
only
sketched
in
obscure
lineaments
was
now
clearly
revealed
the
same
truth
is
conveyed
in
the
declaration
of
christ
that
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
john
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
that
the
holy
fathers
had
been
destitute
of
that
preaching
which
contains
the
hope
of
salvation
and
of
eternal
life
but
because
they
saw
only
at
a
distance
and
under
shadows
what
we
now
contemplate
in
open
day
but
the
reason
why
it
was
necessary
for
the
church
of
god
to
ascend
from
those
rudiments
to
sublimer
heights
is
explained
by
john
the
baptist
the
law
was
given
by
moses
but
grace
and
truth
came
by
jesus
for
although
expiation
of
sin
was
truly
promised
in
the
ancient
sacrifices
and
the
ark
of
the
covenant
was
a
certain
pledge
of
the
paternal
favour
of
god
all
these
would
have
been
mere
shadows
if
they
had
not
been
founded
in
the
grace
of
christ
where
alone
we
may
find
true
and
eternal
stability
let
us
firmly
maintain
then
that
though
the
legal
rites
have
ceased
to
be
observed
yet
their
very
discontinuance
gives
us
a
better
knowledge
of
their
great
utility
before
the
advent
of
christ
who
abolishing
the
observance
of
them
confirmed
their
virtue
and
efficacy
in
his
death
xvii
the
reasoning
of
paul
is
attended
with
more
difficulty
and
you
being
dead
in
your
sins
and
the
uncircumcision
of
your
flesh
hath
he
quickened
together
with
him
having
forgiven
you
all
trespasses
blotting
out
the
of
ordinances
that
was
against
us
which
was
contrary
to
us
and
took
it
out
of
the
way
nailing
it
to
his
cross
for
it
seems
to
extend
the
abolition
of
the
law
somewhat
further
as
though
we
had
now
no
concern
with
its
for
they
are
in
an
error
who
understand
it
simply
of
the
moral
law
the
abolition
of
which
they
nevertheless
explain
to
relate
to
its
inexorable
severity
rather
than
to
its
precepts
others
more
acutely
and
carefully
considering
the
words
of
paul
perceive
that
they
belong
particularly
to
the
ceremonial
law
and
prove
that
the
word
ordinances
is
more
than
once
used
by
paul
in
that
signification
for
he
thus
expresses
himself
to
the
ephesians
he
is
our
peace
who
hath
made
both
one
having
abolished
the
law
of
commandments
contained
in
ordinances
for
to
make
in
himself
of
twain
one
new
that
he
there
speaks
of
the
ceremonies
is
very
evident
for
he
calls
the
law
the
middle
wall
of
partition
by
which
the
jews
were
separated
from
the
gentiles
wherefore
i
allow
that
the
former
commentators
are
justly
censured
by
these
but
even
these
do
not
appear
to
me
clearly
to
explain
the
meaning
of
the
apostle
for
to
compare
these
two
passages
as
in
all
respects
similar
is
what
i
by
no
means
approve
when
he
designs
to
assure
the
ephesians
of
their
admission
into
fellowship
with
the
israelites
he
informs
them
that
the
impediment
which
formerly
prevented
it
is
now
removed
that
consisted
in
ceremonies
for
the
rites
of
ablutions
and
sacrifices
by
which
the
jews
were
consecrated
to
the
lord
caused
a
separation
between
them
and
the
gentiles
but
in
the
epistle
to
the
colossians
he
treats
of
a
sublimer
mystery
the
controversy
there
relates
to
the
mosaic
observances
to
which
the
false
apostles
were
strenuously
attempting
to
subject
the
christians
but
as
in
the
epistle
to
the
galatians
he
goes
to
the
depth
of
that
controversy
and
reduces
it
to
its
source
so
also
in
this
place
for
if
in
the
rites
you
contemplate
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
performing
them
to
what
purpose
were
they
called
a
that
was
against
us
and
almost
the
whole
of
our
redemption
made
to
consist
in
its
being
blotted
out
wherefore
it
is
evident
that
here
is
something
to
be
considered
beside
the
external
ceremonies
and
i
am
persuaded
that
i
have
discovered
the
genuine
meaning
at
least
if
that
be
conceded
to
me
as
a
truth
which
augustine
somewhere
very
truly
asserts
and
which
he
has
even
borrowed
from
the
positive
expressions
of
an
apostle
that
in
the
jewish
ceremonies
there
was
rather
a
confession
of
sins
than
an
expiation
of
them
for
what
did
they
do
in
offering
sacrifices
but
confess
themselves
worthy
of
death
since
they
substituted
victims
to
be
slain
in
their
stead
what
were
their
purifications
but
confessions
that
they
were
themselves
impure
thus
the
both
of
their
sin
and
of
their
impurity
was
frequently
renewed
by
them
but
that
confession
afforded
no
deliverance
for
which
reason
the
apostle
says
that
the
death
of
christ
effected
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
the
apostle
therefore
justly
denominates
the
ceremonies
a
against
those
who
observe
them
because
by
them
they
publicly
attested
their
condemnation
and
impurity
nor
does
any
objection
arise
from
their
having
been
also
partakers
of
the
same
grace
with
us
for
this
they
obtained
in
christ
not
in
the
ceremonies
which
the
apostle
there
distinguishes
from
christ
for
being
practised
at
that
time
after
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
they
obscured
the
glory
of
christ
we
find
then
that
the
ceremonies
considered
by
themselves
are
beautifully
and
appositely
called
a
that
was
against
the
salvation
of
men
because
they
were
solemn
instruments
testifying
their
guilt
when
the
false
apostles
wished
to
bring
the
church
back
to
the
observance
of
them
the
apostle
deeply
investigated
their
signification
and
very
justly
admonished
the
colossians
into
what
circumstances
they
would
relapse
if
they
should
suffer
themselves
to
be
thus
enslaved
by
them
for
they
would
at
the
same
time
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
christ
since
by
the
eternal
expiation
that
he
has
once
effected
he
has
abolished
those
daily
observances
which
could
only
attest
their
sins
but
could
never
cancel
them
chapter
viii
an
exposition
of
the
moral
law
here
i
think
it
will
not
be
foreign
to
our
subject
to
introduce
the
ten
precepts
of
the
law
with
a
brief
exposition
of
them
for
this
will
more
clearly
evince
what
i
have
suggested
that
the
service
which
god
has
once
prescribed
always
remains
in
full
force
and
will
also
furnish
us
with
a
confirmation
of
the
second
remark
that
the
jews
not
only
learned
from
it
the
nature
of
true
piety
but
when
they
saw
their
inability
to
observe
it
were
led
by
the
fear
of
its
sentence
though
not
without
reluctance
to
the
mediator
now
in
giving
a
summary
of
those
things
which
are
requisite
to
the
true
knowledge
of
god
we
have
shown
that
we
can
form
no
conceptions
of
his
greatness
but
his
majesty
immediately
discovers
itself
to
us
to
constrain
us
to
worship
him
in
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
we
have
laid
down
this
as
a
principal
article
that
being
divested
of
all
opinion
of
our
own
strength
and
confidence
in
our
own
righteousness
and
on
the
other
hand
discouraged
and
depressed
by
a
consciousness
of
our
poverty
we
should
learn
true
humility
and
the
lord
accomplishes
both
these
things
in
his
law
where
in
the
first
place
claiming
to
himself
the
legitimate
authority
to
command
he
calls
us
to
revere
his
divinity
and
prescribes
the
parts
of
which
this
reverence
consists
and
in
the
next
place
promulgating
the
rule
of
his
righteousness
the
rectitude
of
which
our
nature
being
depraved
and
perverted
perpetually
opposes
and
from
the
perfection
of
which
our
ability
through
its
indolence
and
imbecility
towards
that
which
is
good
is
at
a
great
distance
he
convicts
us
both
of
impotence
and
of
unrighteousness
moreover
the
internal
law
which
has
before
been
said
to
be
inscribed
and
as
it
were
engraven
on
the
hearts
of
all
men
suggests
to
us
in
some
measure
the
same
things
which
are
to
be
learned
from
the
two
tables
for
our
conscience
does
not
permit
us
to
sleep
in
perpetual
insensibility
but
is
an
internal
witness
and
monitor
of
the
duties
we
owe
to
god
shows
us
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
and
so
accuses
us
when
we
deviate
from
our
duty
but
man
involved
as
he
is
in
a
cloud
of
errors
scarcely
obtains
from
this
law
of
nature
the
smallest
idea
of
what
worship
is
accepted
by
god
but
is
certainly
at
an
immense
distance
from
a
right
understanding
of
it
besides
he
is
so
elated
with
arrogance
and
ambition
and
so
blinded
with
that
he
can
not
yet
take
a
view
of
himself
and
as
it
were
retire
within
that
he
may
learn
to
submit
and
humble
himself
and
to
confess
his
misery
since
it
was
necessary
therefore
both
for
our
dulness
and
obstinacy
the
lord
gave
us
a
written
law
to
declare
with
greater
certainty
what
in
the
law
of
nature
was
too
obscure
and
by
arousing
our
indolence
to
make
a
deeper
impression
on
our
understanding
and
memory
ii
now
it
is
easy
to
perceive
what
we
are
to
learn
from
the
law
namely
that
god
as
he
is
our
creator
justly
sustains
towards
us
the
character
of
a
father
and
of
a
lord
and
that
on
this
account
we
owe
to
him
glory
and
reverence
love
and
fear
moreover
that
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
follow
every
thing
to
which
the
violence
of
our
passions
may
incite
us
but
that
we
ought
to
be
attentive
to
his
will
and
to
practise
nothing
but
what
is
pleasing
to
him
in
the
next
place
that
righteousness
and
rectitude
are
a
delight
but
iniquity
an
abomination
to
him
and
that
therefore
unless
we
will
with
impious
ingratitude
rebel
against
our
maker
we
must
necessarily
spend
our
whole
lives
in
the
practice
of
righteousness
for
if
we
manifest
a
becoming
reverence
for
him
only
when
we
prefer
his
will
to
our
own
it
follows
that
there
is
no
other
legitimate
worship
of
him
but
the
observance
of
righteousness
sanctity
and
purity
nor
can
we
pretend
to
excuse
ourselves
by
a
want
of
ability
like
insolvent
debtors
for
it
is
improper
for
us
to
measure
the
glory
of
god
by
our
ability
for
whatever
may
be
our
characters
he
ever
remains
like
himself
the
friend
of
righteousness
the
enemy
of
iniquity
whatever
he
requires
of
us
since
he
can
require
nothing
but
what
is
right
we
are
under
a
natural
obligation
to
obey
but
our
inability
is
our
own
fault
for
if
we
are
bound
by
our
own
passions
which
are
under
the
government
of
sin
so
that
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
obey
our
father
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
plead
this
necessity
in
our
defence
the
criminality
of
which
is
within
ourselves
and
must
be
imputed
to
us
iii
when
we
have
made
such
a
proficiency
as
this
by
means
of
the
instruction
of
the
law
we
ought
under
the
same
teacher
to
retire
within
ourselves
from
which
we
may
learn
two
things
first
by
comparing
our
life
with
the
righteousness
of
the
law
we
shall
find
that
we
are
very
far
from
acting
agreeably
to
the
will
of
god
and
are
therefore
unworthy
to
retain
a
place
among
his
creatures
much
less
to
be
numbered
among
his
children
secondly
by
examining
our
strength
we
shall
see
that
it
is
not
only
unequal
to
the
observance
of
the
law
but
a
mere
nullity
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
will
be
a
diffidence
in
our
own
strength
and
an
anxiety
and
trepidation
of
mind
for
the
conscience
can
not
sustain
the
load
of
iniquity
without
an
immediate
discovery
of
the
divine
judgment
and
the
divine
judgment
can
not
be
perceived
without
inspiring
a
dread
of
death
compelled
also
by
proofs
of
its
impotence
it
can
not
avoid
falling
into
an
absolute
despair
of
its
own
strength
both
these
dispositions
produce
humility
and
dejection
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
the
man
terrified
with
the
apprehension
of
eternal
death
which
he
sees
justly
impending
over
him
for
his
unrighteousness
betakes
himself
entirely
to
the
divine
mercy
as
to
the
only
port
of
salvation
and
perceiving
his
inability
to
fulfil
the
commands
of
the
law
and
feeling
nothing
but
despair
in
himself
he
implores
and
expects
assistance
from
another
quarter
iv
but
not
contented
with
having
conciliated
a
reverence
for
his
righteousness
the
lord
has
also
subjoined
promises
and
threatenings
in
order
that
our
hearts
might
imbibe
a
love
for
him
and
at
the
same
time
a
hatred
to
iniquity
for
since
the
eyes
of
our
mind
are
too
dim
to
be
attracted
with
the
mere
beauty
of
virtue
our
most
merciful
father
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
allure
us
to
the
love
and
worship
of
himself
by
the
sweetness
of
his
rewards
he
announces
therefore
that
he
has
reserved
rewards
for
virtue
and
that
the
person
who
obeys
his
commandments
shall
not
labour
in
vain
he
proclaims
on
the
contrary
not
only
that
unrighteousness
is
execrable
in
his
sight
but
also
that
it
shall
not
escape
with
impunity
but
that
he
will
avenge
himself
on
all
the
despisers
of
his
majesty
and
to
urge
us
by
all
possible
motives
he
promises
also
the
blessings
of
the
present
life
as
well
as
eternal
felicity
to
the
obedience
of
those
who
keep
his
commandments
the
transgressors
of
which
he
threatens
not
only
with
present
calamities
but
with
the
torments
of
eternal
death
for
that
promise
these
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
them
and
this
correspondent
threatening
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
undoubtedly
relate
to
a
future
and
endless
immortality
or
death
wherever
we
read
of
the
divine
benevolence
or
wrath
the
former
comprehends
eternal
life
the
latter
eternal
destruction
now
of
present
blessings
and
curses
the
law
contains
a
long
catalogue
the
penal
sanctions
display
the
consummate
purity
of
god
which
can
not
tolerate
iniquity
while
the
promises
not
only
manifest
his
perfect
love
of
righteousness
which
he
can
not
defraud
of
its
reward
but
likewise
illustrate
his
wonderful
goodness
for
since
we
with
all
that
belongs
to
us
are
indebted
to
his
majesty
whatever
he
requires
of
us
he
most
justly
demands
as
the
payment
of
a
debt
but
the
payment
of
a
debt
is
not
entitled
to
remuneration
therefore
he
recedes
from
the
strictness
of
his
claims
when
he
proposes
a
reward
to
our
obedience
which
is
not
performed
spontaneously
as
if
it
were
not
a
duty
but
the
effect
of
those
promises
on
us
has
partly
been
mentioned
already
and
will
hereafter
more
clearly
appear
in
its
proper
place
suffice
it
at
present
if
we
remember
and
consider
that
the
promises
of
the
law
contain
no
mean
recommendation
of
righteousness
to
make
it
more
evident
how
much
god
is
pleased
with
the
observance
of
it
and
that
the
penal
sanctions
are
annexed
to
render
unrighteousness
more
execrable
lest
the
sinner
amidst
the
fascinations
of
sin
should
forget
that
the
judgment
of
the
legislator
awaits
him
now
since
the
lord
when
about
to
deliver
a
rule
of
perfect
righteousness
referred
all
the
parts
of
it
to
his
own
will
this
shows
that
nothing
is
more
acceptable
to
him
than
obedience
this
is
worthy
of
the
most
diligent
observation
since
the
licentiousness
of
the
human
mind
is
so
inclined
to
the
frequent
invention
of
various
services
in
order
to
merit
his
favour
for
this
irreligious
affectation
of
religion
which
is
a
principle
innate
in
the
human
mind
has
betrayed
itself
in
all
ages
and
betrays
itself
even
in
the
present
day
for
men
always
take
a
pleasure
in
contriving
some
way
of
attaining
righteousness
which
is
not
agreeable
to
the
divine
word
hence
among
those
which
are
commonly
esteemed
good
works
the
precepts
of
the
law
hold
a
very
contracted
station
the
numberless
multitude
of
human
inventions
occupying
almost
the
whole
space
but
what
was
the
design
of
moses
unless
it
was
to
repress
such
an
unwarrantable
license
when
after
the
promulgation
of
the
law
he
addressed
the
people
in
the
following
manner
observe
and
hear
all
these
words
which
i
command
thee
that
it
may
go
well
with
thee
and
with
thy
children
after
thee
for
ever
when
thou
doest
that
which
is
good
and
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
what
thing
soever
i
command
you
observe
to
do
it
thou
shalt
not
add
thereto
nor
diminish
from
and
before
when
he
had
declared
that
this
was
their
wisdom
and
their
understanding
in
the
sight
of
other
nations
that
they
had
received
statutes
and
judgments
and
ceremonies
from
the
lord
he
had
added
take
heed
to
thyself
and
keep
thy
soul
diligently
lest
thou
forget
the
things
which
thine
eyes
have
seen
and
lest
they
depart
from
thy
heart
all
the
days
of
thy
foreseeing
that
the
israelites
would
not
rest
but
even
after
the
reception
of
the
law
would
labour
to
produce
new
species
of
righteousness
foreign
from
what
the
law
requires
unless
they
should
be
rigorously
restrained
god
pronounces
that
his
word
comprehends
the
perfection
of
righteousness
and
yet
though
this
ought
most
effectually
to
have
prevented
them
they
were
guilty
of
that
very
presumption
which
was
so
expressly
forbidden
but
what
is
this
to
us
we
are
certainly
bound
by
the
same
declaration
for
the
claims
of
the
lord
on
behalf
of
his
law
that
it
contains
the
doctrine
of
perfect
righteousness
beyond
all
doubt
remain
perpetually
the
same
yet
not
contented
with
it
we
are
wonderfully
laborious
in
inventing
and
performing
other
good
works
one
after
another
the
best
remedy
for
this
fault
will
be
a
constant
attention
to
this
reflection
that
the
law
was
given
to
us
from
heaven
to
teach
us
a
perfect
righteousness
that
in
it
no
righteousness
is
taught
but
that
which
is
conformable
to
the
decrees
of
the
divine
will
that
it
is
therefore
vain
to
attempt
new
species
of
works
in
order
to
merit
the
favour
of
god
whose
legitimate
worship
consists
solely
in
obedience
but
that
any
pursuit
of
good
works
deviating
from
the
law
of
god
is
an
intolerable
profanation
of
the
divine
and
real
righteousness
there
is
much
truth
also
in
the
observation
of
augustine
who
calls
obedience
to
god
sometimes
the
parent
and
guardian
and
sometimes
the
origin
of
all
virtues
vi
but
when
we
have
given
an
exposition
of
the
divine
law
we
shall
then
more
suitably
and
profitably
confirm
what
has
been
already
advanced
concerning
its
office
and
use
before
we
enter
however
on
the
discussion
of
each
article
separately
it
will
be
useful
to
premise
some
things
which
may
contribute
to
a
general
knowledge
of
it
first
let
it
be
understood
that
the
law
inculcates
a
conformity
of
life
not
only
to
external
probity
but
also
to
internal
and
spiritual
righteousness
now
though
none
can
deny
this
yet
very
few
persons
pay
proper
attention
to
it
this
arises
from
their
not
considering
the
legislator
by
whose
nature
we
ought
to
estimate
also
the
nature
of
the
law
if
a
king
prohibit
by
an
edict
adultery
murder
or
theft
no
man
i
confess
will
be
liable
to
the
penalty
of
such
a
law
who
has
only
conceived
in
his
mind
a
desire
to
commit
adultery
murder
or
theft
but
has
not
perpetrated
any
of
them
because
the
superintendence
of
a
mortal
legislator
extends
only
to
the
external
conduct
and
his
prohibitions
are
not
violated
unless
the
crimes
be
actually
committed
but
god
whose
eye
nothing
escapes
and
who
esteems
not
so
much
the
external
appearance
as
the
purity
of
the
heart
in
the
prohibition
of
adultery
murder
and
theft
comprises
a
prohibition
of
lust
wrath
hatred
coveting
what
belongs
to
another
fraud
and
every
similar
vice
for
being
a
spiritual
legislator
he
addresses
himself
to
the
soul
as
much
as
to
the
body
now
the
murder
of
the
soul
is
wrath
and
hatred
the
theft
of
the
soul
is
evil
concupiscence
and
avarice
the
adultery
of
the
soul
is
lust
but
it
will
be
said
that
human
laws
also
relate
to
designs
and
intentions
and
not
to
fortuitous
events
this
i
grant
but
they
relate
to
such
designs
and
intentions
as
have
been
manifested
in
outward
actions
they
examine
and
consider
with
what
intention
every
act
has
been
performed
but
do
not
scrutinize
the
secret
thoughts
human
laws
therefore
are
satisfied
when
a
man
abstains
from
external
transgression
but
on
the
contrary
the
divine
law
being
given
to
our
minds
the
proper
regulation
of
them
is
the
principal
requisite
to
a
righteous
observance
of
it
but
men
in
general
even
while
they
resolutely
dissemble
their
contempt
of
the
law
dispose
their
eyes
their
feet
their
hands
and
all
the
parts
of
their
body
to
some
kind
of
observance
of
it
while
at
the
same
time
their
hearts
are
entirely
alienated
from
all
obedience
to
it
and
they
suppose
that
they
have
discharged
their
duty
if
they
have
concealed
from
man
what
they
practise
in
the
sight
of
god
they
hear
the
commands
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
they
draw
not
the
sword
to
commit
murder
they
never
associate
with
harlots
they
lay
no
violent
hands
on
the
property
of
others
all
these
things
thus
far
are
well
but
in
their
whole
souls
they
breathe
after
murders
they
kindle
into
lust
they
look
with
dishonest
eyes
on
the
property
of
others
and
in
their
cupidity
they
devour
it
now
then
they
are
destitute
of
the
principal
requisite
of
the
law
whence
arises
such
gross
stupidity
but
from
discarding
the
legislator
and
accommodating
a
righteousness
to
their
own
inclination
these
persons
paul
strongly
opposes
when
he
affirms
that
the
law
is
spiritual
signifying
that
it
requires
not
only
the
obedience
of
the
soul
the
understanding
and
the
will
but
even
an
angelic
purity
which
being
cleansed
from
all
the
pollution
of
the
flesh
may
savour
entirely
of
the
spirit
vii
when
we
say
that
this
is
the
sense
of
the
law
we
are
not
introducing
a
novel
interpretation
of
our
own
but
following
christ
who
is
the
best
interpreter
of
it
for
the
people
having
imbibed
from
the
pharisees
the
corrupt
opinion
that
he
who
has
perpetrated
no
external
act
of
disobedience
to
the
law
is
an
observer
of
the
law
he
confutes
this
very
dangerous
error
and
pronounces
an
unchaste
look
at
a
woman
to
be
adultery
he
declares
them
to
be
murderers
who
hate
a
brother
he
makes
them
in
danger
of
the
judgment
who
have
only
conceived
resentment
in
their
hearts
them
in
danger
of
the
council
who
in
murmuring
or
quarrelling
have
discovered
any
sign
of
an
angry
mind
and
them
in
danger
of
hell
fire
who
with
opprobrious
and
slanderous
language
have
broken
forth
into
open
rage
persons
who
have
not
perceived
these
things
have
pretended
that
christ
was
another
moses
the
giver
of
an
evangelical
law
which
supplied
the
deficiencies
of
the
law
of
moses
whence
that
common
maxim
concerning
the
perfection
of
the
evangelical
law
that
it
is
far
superior
to
the
old
maxim
in
many
respects
very
pernicious
for
when
we
introduce
a
summary
of
the
commandments
it
will
appear
from
moses
himself
what
an
indignity
this
fixes
on
the
divine
law
it
certainly
insinuates
that
all
the
sanctity
of
the
fathers
under
the
old
testament
was
not
very
remote
from
hypocrisy
and
draws
us
aside
from
that
one
perpetual
rule
of
righteousness
but
there
is
not
the
least
difficulty
in
the
confutation
of
this
error
for
they
have
supposed
that
christ
made
additions
to
the
law
whereas
he
only
restored
it
to
its
genuine
purity
by
clearing
it
from
the
obscurities
and
blemishes
which
it
had
contracted
from
the
falsehoods
and
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
viii
it
must
be
observed
in
the
second
place
that
the
commands
and
prohibitions
always
imply
more
than
the
words
express
but
this
must
be
so
restricted
that
we
may
not
make
it
a
lesbian
rule
by
the
assistance
of
which
the
scripture
may
be
licentiously
perverted
and
any
sense
be
extorted
at
pleasure
from
any
passage
for
some
people
by
this
immoderate
and
excursive
liberty
cause
one
person
to
despise
the
authority
of
the
law
and
another
to
despair
of
understanding
it
therefore
if
it
be
possible
we
must
find
some
way
that
may
lead
us
by
a
straight
and
steady
course
to
the
will
of
god
we
must
inquire
i
say
how
far
our
interpretation
ought
to
exceed
the
limits
of
the
expressions
that
it
may
evidently
appear
not
to
be
an
appendix
of
human
glosses
annexed
to
the
divine
law
but
a
faithful
explanation
of
the
pure
and
genuine
sense
of
the
legislator
indeed
in
all
the
commandments
the
figure
synecdoche
by
which
a
part
is
expressed
instead
of
the
whole
is
so
conspicuous
that
he
may
justly
be
the
object
of
ridicule
who
would
restrict
the
sense
of
the
law
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
words
it
is
plain
then
that
a
sober
exposition
of
the
law
goes
beyond
the
words
of
it
but
how
far
remains
doubtful
unless
some
rule
be
laid
down
the
best
rule
then
i
conceive
will
be
that
the
exposition
be
directed
to
the
design
of
the
precept
that
in
regard
to
every
precept
it
should
be
considered
for
what
end
it
was
given
for
example
every
precept
is
either
imperative
or
prohibitory
the
true
meaning
of
both
these
kinds
of
precepts
will
immediately
occur
to
us
if
we
consider
the
design
or
the
end
of
them
as
the
end
of
the
fifth
commandment
is
that
honour
may
be
given
to
them
to
whom
god
assigns
it
the
substance
of
this
precept
then
is
that
it
is
right
and
pleasing
to
god
that
we
should
honour
those
on
whom
he
has
conferred
any
excellence
and
that
contemptuous
and
contumacious
conduct
towards
them
is
an
abomination
to
him
the
design
of
the
first
commandment
is
that
god
alone
may
be
worshipped
the
substance
of
this
precept
then
will
be
that
true
piety
that
is
the
worship
of
his
majesty
is
pleasing
to
god
and
that
he
abominates
impiety
thus
in
every
commandment
we
should
first
examine
the
subject
of
it
in
the
next
place
we
should
inquire
the
end
of
it
till
we
discover
what
the
legislator
really
declares
in
it
to
be
either
pleasing
or
displeasing
to
him
lastly
we
must
draw
an
argument
from
this
commandment
to
the
opposite
of
it
in
this
manner
this
please
god
the
contrary
must
displease
him
if
this
displease
him
the
contrary
must
please
him
if
he
enjoin
this
he
forbids
the
contrary
if
he
forbid
this
he
enjoins
the
contrary
ix
what
we
now
rather
obscurely
hint
at
will
be
fully
and
practically
elucidated
in
our
exposition
of
the
commandments
wherefore
it
is
sufficient
to
have
suggested
it
only
the
last
position
which
otherwise
might
not
be
understood
or
if
understood
might
seem
unreasonable
requires
to
be
briefly
established
by
suitable
proof
it
needs
no
proof
that
an
injunction
of
any
thing
good
is
a
prohibition
of
the
opposite
evil
for
every
man
will
concede
it
and
common
sense
will
easily
admit
that
a
prohibition
of
crimes
is
a
command
to
practise
the
contrary
duties
it
is
commonly
considered
as
a
commendation
of
virtues
when
censure
is
passed
on
the
opposite
vices
but
we
require
somewhat
more
than
is
commonly
intended
by
those
forms
of
expression
for
men
generally
understand
the
virtue
which
is
opposite
to
any
vice
to
be
an
abstinence
from
that
vice
but
we
affirm
that
it
goes
further
even
to
the
actual
performance
of
the
opposite
duty
therefore
in
this
precept
thou
shalt
not
kill
the
common
sense
of
mankind
will
perceive
nothing
more
than
that
we
ought
to
abstain
from
all
acts
of
injury
to
others
and
from
all
desire
to
commit
any
such
acts
i
maintain
that
it
also
implies
that
we
should
do
every
thing
that
we
possibly
can
towards
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
our
neighbour
and
not
to
speak
without
reason
i
prove
it
in
the
following
manner
god
forbids
us
to
injure
the
safety
of
our
brother
because
he
wishes
his
life
to
be
dear
and
precious
to
us
he
therefore
at
the
same
time
requires
of
us
all
those
offices
of
love
which
may
contribute
to
the
preservation
of
it
thus
we
perceive
that
the
end
of
the
precept
will
always
discover
to
us
whatever
it
enjoins
or
forbids
us
to
do
x
many
reasons
are
frequently
given
why
god
has
as
it
were
in
incomplete
precepts
rather
partially
intimated
his
will
than
positively
expressed
it
but
the
reason
which
affords
me
more
satisfaction
than
all
others
is
the
following
because
the
flesh
always
endeavours
to
extenuate
and
by
specious
pretexts
to
conceal
the
turpitude
of
sin
unless
it
be
exceedingly
palpable
he
has
proposed
by
way
of
example
in
every
kind
of
transgression
that
which
is
most
atrocious
and
detestable
and
the
mention
of
which
inspires
us
with
horror
in
order
that
our
minds
might
be
impressed
with
the
greater
detestation
of
every
sin
this
often
deceives
us
in
forming
an
opinion
of
vices
if
they
be
private
we
extenuate
them
the
lord
destroys
these
subterfuges
when
he
accustoms
us
to
refer
the
whole
multitude
of
vices
to
these
general
heads
which
best
represent
the
abominable
nature
of
every
species
of
transgressions
for
example
anger
and
hatred
are
not
supposed
to
be
such
execrable
crimes
when
they
are
mentioned
under
their
own
proper
appellations
but
when
they
are
forbidden
to
us
under
the
name
of
murder
we
have
a
clearer
perception
how
abominable
they
are
in
the
view
of
god
by
whose
word
they
are
classed
under
such
a
flagitious
and
horrible
species
of
crimes
and
being
influenced
by
his
judgment
we
accustom
ourselves
more
seriously
to
consider
the
atrociousness
of
those
offences
which
we
previously
accounted
trivial
xi
in
the
third
place
let
it
be
considered
what
is
intended
by
the
division
of
the
divine
law
into
two
tables
the
frequent
and
solemn
mention
of
which
all
wise
men
will
judge
not
to
be
without
some
particular
design
and
we
have
a
reason
at
hand
which
removes
all
ambiguity
on
this
subject
for
god
has
divided
his
law
into
two
parts
which
comprise
the
perfection
of
righteousness
so
that
he
has
assigned
the
first
part
to
the
duties
of
religion
which
peculiarly
belongs
to
the
worship
of
his
majesty
and
the
second
to
those
duties
of
charity
which
respect
men
the
first
foundation
of
righteousness
is
certainly
the
worship
of
god
and
if
this
be
destroyed
all
the
other
branches
of
righteousness
like
the
parts
of
a
disjointed
and
falling
edifice
are
torn
asunder
and
scattered
for
what
kind
of
righteousness
will
you
pretend
to
because
you
refrain
from
harassing
men
by
acts
of
theft
and
rapine
if
at
the
same
time
you
atrociously
and
sacrilegiously
defraud
the
majesty
of
god
of
the
glory
which
is
due
to
him
you
do
not
pollute
your
body
with
fornication
if
you
blasphemously
profane
the
sacred
name
of
god
you
murder
no
man
if
you
strive
to
destroy
and
extinguish
all
memory
of
god
it
is
in
vain
therefore
to
boast
of
righteousness
without
religion
as
well
might
the
trunk
of
a
body
be
exhibited
as
a
beautiful
object
after
the
head
has
been
cut
off
nor
is
religion
only
the
head
of
righteousness
but
the
very
soul
of
it
constituting
all
its
life
and
vigour
for
without
the
fear
of
god
men
preserve
no
equity
and
love
among
themselves
we
therefore
call
the
worship
of
god
the
principle
and
foundation
of
righteousness
because
if
that
be
wanting
whatever
equity
continence
and
temperance
men
may
practise
among
themselves
it
is
all
vain
and
frivolous
in
the
sight
of
god
we
assert
also
that
it
is
the
source
and
soul
of
righteousness
because
men
are
taught
by
it
to
live
temperately
and
justly
with
one
another
if
they
venerate
god
as
the
judge
of
right
and
wrong
in
the
first
table
therefore
he
instructs
us
in
piety
and
the
proper
duties
of
religion
in
which
his
majesty
is
to
be
worshipped
in
the
second
he
prescribes
the
duties
which
the
fear
of
his
name
should
excite
us
to
practise
in
society
for
this
reason
our
lord
as
the
evangelists
inform
us
summarily
comprised
the
whole
law
in
two
principal
we
love
god
with
all
our
heart
with
all
our
soul
and
with
all
our
strength
and
that
we
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
of
the
two
parts
in
which
he
comprehends
the
whole
law
we
see
how
he
directs
one
towards
god
and
assigns
the
other
to
men
xii
but
although
the
whole
law
is
contained
in
these
two
principal
points
yet
our
god
in
order
to
remove
every
pretext
of
excuse
has
been
pleased
in
the
ten
commandments
more
diffusely
and
explicitly
to
declare
as
well
those
things
which
relate
to
our
honour
love
and
fear
of
him
as
those
which
pertain
to
that
charity
which
he
commands
us
for
his
sake
to
exercise
towards
men
nor
is
it
a
useless
study
to
examine
into
the
division
of
the
commandments
provided
you
remember
it
is
a
subject
of
such
a
nature
that
every
man
ought
to
be
at
liberty
to
judge
of
it
and
that
we
ought
not
contentiously
to
oppose
any
who
may
differ
from
us
respecting
it
but
we
are
under
a
necessity
of
touching
on
this
topic
lest
the
reader
should
despise
or
wonder
at
the
division
that
we
shall
adopt
as
a
novel
invention
that
the
law
is
divided
into
ten
precepts
is
beyond
all
controversy
being
frequently
established
by
the
authority
of
god
himself
the
question
therefore
is
not
concerning
the
number
of
the
precepts
but
concerning
the
manner
of
dividing
them
those
who
divide
them
so
as
to
assign
three
precepts
to
the
first
table
and
leave
the
remaining
seven
to
the
second
expunge
from
the
number
the
precept
concerning
images
or
at
least
conceal
it
under
the
first
whereas
it
is
undoubtedly
delivered
by
the
lord
as
a
distinct
commandment
but
the
tenth
against
coveting
the
property
of
our
neighbour
they
improperly
divide
into
two
we
shall
see
presently
that
such
a
method
of
division
was
unknown
in
purer
ages
others
reckon
with
us
four
articles
in
the
first
table
but
the
first
commandment
they
consider
as
a
simple
promise
without
a
precept
now
i
understand
the
ten
words
mentioned
by
moses
to
be
ten
precepts
and
i
think
i
see
that
number
disposed
in
the
most
beautiful
order
and
therefore
unless
i
am
convinced
by
clear
argument
leaving
them
in
possession
of
their
opinion
i
shall
follow
what
appears
to
me
to
be
preferable
that
is
that
what
they
make
the
first
precept
is
a
preface
to
the
whole
law
that
it
is
followed
by
the
precepts
four
belonging
to
the
first
table
and
six
to
the
second
in
the
order
in
which
they
will
now
be
recited
origen
has
mentioned
this
division
as
if
it
were
universally
received
in
his
time
without
any
controversy
augustine
also
coincides
with
us
for
in
enumerating
them
to
boniface
he
observes
this
order
that
god
alone
be
religiously
worshipped
that
no
adoration
be
paid
to
an
idol
that
the
name
of
the
lord
be
not
taken
in
vain
he
had
before
spoken
separately
of
the
shadowy
precept
of
the
sabbath
it
is
true
that
in
another
passage
he
expresses
his
approbation
of
the
former
division
but
for
a
most
trivial
reason
namely
that
if
the
first
table
be
digested
into
three
precepts
the
trinal
number
will
be
a
more
conspicuous
exhibition
of
the
mystery
of
the
trinity
in
the
same
place
however
he
does
not
conceal
that
in
other
respects
he
prefers
our
division
beside
these
writers
the
author
of
the
unfinished
treatise
on
matthew
is
of
the
same
opinion
with
us
josephus
doubtless
according
to
the
common
opinion
of
his
time
assigns
five
precepts
to
each
table
this
is
repugnant
to
reason
because
it
confounds
the
distinction
between
religion
and
charity
and
is
also
refuted
by
the
authority
of
our
lord
who
in
matthew
places
the
precept
concerning
honour
to
parents
in
the
second
table
now
let
us
hear
god
himself
speaking
in
his
own
words
the
first
commandment
am
the
lord
thy
god
which
have
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
xiii
whether
you
make
the
first
sentence
a
part
of
the
first
commandment
or
read
it
separately
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
provided
you
allow
it
to
be
a
preface
to
the
whole
law
the
first
object
of
attention
in
making
laws
is
to
guard
against
their
being
abrogated
by
contempt
therefore
god
in
the
first
place
provides
that
the
majesty
of
the
law
which
he
is
about
to
deliver
may
never
fall
into
contempt
and
to
sanction
it
he
uses
a
threefold
argument
he
asserts
his
authority
and
right
of
giving
commands
and
thereby
lays
his
chosen
people
under
a
necessity
of
obeying
them
he
exhibits
a
promise
of
grace
to
allure
them
by
its
charms
to
the
pursuit
of
holiness
he
reminds
the
israelites
of
his
favour
to
convict
them
of
ingratitude
if
they
do
not
conduct
themselves
in
a
manner
correspondent
to
his
goodness
the
name
lord
or
jehovah
designates
his
authority
and
legitimate
dominion
for
if
all
things
be
of
him
and
if
in
him
all
things
consist
it
is
reasonable
that
all
things
be
referred
to
him
agreeably
to
the
observation
of
paul
therefore
by
this
word
alone
we
are
brought
into
complete
subjection
to
the
power
of
the
divine
majesty
for
it
would
be
monstrous
for
us
to
desire
to
remove
ourselves
from
his
jurisdiction
out
of
whom
we
can
not
exist
xiv
after
having
shown
that
he
has
a
right
to
command
and
that
obedience
is
his
just
due
he
may
not
appear
to
constrain
us
by
necessity
alone
he
sweetly
allures
us
by
pronouncing
himself
the
god
of
the
church
for
the
expression
implies
the
mutual
relation
which
is
contained
in
that
promise
i
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
whence
christ
proves
the
immortality
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
from
the
declaration
of
the
lord
that
he
is
their
god
wherefore
it
is
the
same
as
if
he
had
said
i
have
chosen
you
as
my
people
not
only
to
bless
you
in
the
present
life
but
to
bestow
upon
you
abundant
felicity
in
the
life
to
come
the
design
of
this
favour
is
remarked
in
various
places
in
the
law
for
when
the
lord
in
mercy
condescends
to
number
us
among
the
society
of
his
people
he
chooseth
us
says
moses
to
be
a
peculiar
people
unto
himself
a
holy
people
to
keep
his
hence
that
exhortation
ye
shall
be
holy
for
i
am
now
from
these
two
considerations
is
derived
the
remonstrance
of
the
lord
by
the
prophet
a
son
honoureth
his
father
and
a
servant
his
master
if
then
i
be
a
father
where
is
mine
honour
and
if
i
be
a
master
where
is
my
fear
xv
next
follows
a
recital
of
his
kindness
which
ought
to
produce
a
most
powerful
effect
upon
our
minds
in
proportion
to
the
detestable
guilt
of
ingratitude
even
among
men
he
reminded
the
israelites
indeed
of
a
favour
which
they
had
recently
experienced
but
which
on
account
of
its
magnitude
and
concomitant
miracles
being
worthy
of
everlasting
remembrance
might
also
have
an
influence
on
succeeding
generations
besides
it
was
particularly
suitable
to
the
present
occasion
when
the
law
was
about
to
be
published
for
the
lord
suggests
that
they
were
liberated
from
a
miserable
slavery
in
order
that
they
might
serve
the
author
of
their
liberty
with
a
promptitude
of
reverence
and
obedience
to
retain
us
in
the
true
and
exclusive
worship
of
himself
he
generally
distinguishes
himself
by
certain
epithets
by
which
he
discriminates
his
sacred
name
from
all
idols
and
fictitious
deities
for
as
i
have
before
observed
such
is
our
proneness
to
vanity
and
presumption
that
as
soon
as
god
is
mentioned
our
mind
is
unable
to
guard
itself
from
falling
into
some
vain
imagination
therefore
when
god
intends
to
apply
a
remedy
to
this
evil
he
adorns
his
majesty
with
certain
titles
and
thus
circumscribes
us
with
barriers
that
we
may
not
run
into
various
follies
and
presumptuously
invent
to
ourselves
some
new
deity
discarding
the
living
god
and
setting
up
an
idol
in
his
stead
for
this
reason
the
prophets
whenever
they
intend
a
proper
designation
of
him
invest
him
and
as
it
were
surround
him
with
those
characters
under
which
he
had
manifested
himself
to
the
people
of
israel
yet
when
he
is
called
the
god
of
abraham
or
the
god
of
israel
when
he
is
said
to
reside
between
the
cherubim
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
these
and
similar
forms
of
expression
do
not
confine
him
to
one
place
or
to
one
nation
they
are
only
used
to
fix
the
thoughts
of
the
pious
on
that
god
who
in
the
covenant
which
he
has
made
with
israel
has
given
such
a
representation
of
himself
that
it
is
not
proper
to
deviate
in
the
smallest
instance
from
such
a
model
nevertheless
let
it
be
concluded
that
the
deliverance
of
the
jews
is
mentioned
to
induce
them
to
devote
themselves
with
more
alacrity
to
the
service
of
god
who
justly
claims
a
right
to
their
obedience
but
that
we
may
not
suppose
this
to
have
no
relation
to
us
it
behoves
us
to
consider
that
the
servitude
of
israel
in
egypt
was
a
type
of
the
spiritual
captivity
in
which
we
are
all
detained
till
our
celestial
deliverer
extricates
us
by
the
power
of
his
arm
and
introduces
us
into
the
kingdom
of
liberty
as
formerly
therefore
when
he
designed
to
restore
the
dispersed
israelites
to
the
worship
of
his
name
he
rescued
them
from
the
intolerable
tyranny
of
pharaoh
by
which
they
were
oppressed
so
now
he
delivers
all
those
whose
god
he
declares
himself
to
be
from
the
fatal
dominion
of
satan
which
was
represented
by
that
corporeal
captivity
wherefore
there
is
no
one
whose
mind
ought
not
to
be
excited
to
listen
to
the
law
which
he
is
informed
came
from
the
king
of
kings
from
whom
as
all
creatures
derive
their
origin
so
it
is
reasonable
that
they
should
regard
him
as
their
end
in
all
things
every
man
i
say
ought
to
welcome
the
legislator
to
observe
whose
commands
he
is
taught
that
he
is
particularly
chosen
from
whose
benignity
he
expects
an
abundance
of
temporal
blessings
and
a
life
of
immortality
and
glory
by
whose
wonderful
power
and
mercy
he
knows
himself
to
be
delivered
from
the
jaws
of
death
xvi
having
firmly
established
the
authority
of
his
law
he
publishes
the
first
commandment
that
we
should
have
no
other
gods
before
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
god
chooses
to
have
the
sole
preëminence
and
to
enjoy
undiminished
his
authority
among
his
people
to
produce
this
end
he
enjoins
us
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
all
impiety
and
superstition
by
which
we
should
either
diminish
or
obscure
the
glory
of
his
deity
and
for
the
same
reason
he
directs
us
to
worship
and
adore
him
in
the
exercise
of
true
piety
the
simplicity
of
the
language
almost
expresses
this
for
we
can
not
have
god
without
at
the
same
time
comprising
all
that
belongs
to
him
therefore
when
he
forbids
us
to
have
any
other
gods
he
implies
that
we
must
not
transfer
to
another
what
belongs
to
him
but
although
the
duties
we
owe
to
god
are
innumerable
yet
they
may
not
improperly
be
classed
under
four
general
a
necessary
branch
of
which
is
the
spiritual
obedience
of
the
conscience
trust
invocation
and
thanksgiving
by
adoration
i
mean
the
reverence
and
worship
which
he
receives
from
every
one
of
us
who
has
submitted
to
his
majesty
wherefore
it
is
not
without
reason
that
i
make
it
partly
to
consist
in
a
subjection
of
our
consciences
to
his
law
for
it
is
a
spiritual
homage
which
is
rendered
to
him
as
to
a
sovereign
king
possessed
of
all
power
over
our
souls
trust
is
a
secure
dependence
on
him
arising
from
a
knowledge
of
his
perfections
when
ascribing
to
him
all
wisdom
righteousness
power
truth
and
goodness
we
esteem
ourselves
happy
only
in
communications
from
him
invocation
is
the
application
of
our
minds
under
every
pressure
of
necessity
resorting
to
his
fidelity
faithfulness
and
assistance
as
its
only
defence
thanksgiving
is
gratitude
which
ascribes
to
him
the
praise
of
all
blessings
as
the
lord
permits
no
portion
of
these
duties
to
be
transferred
to
another
so
he
commands
them
to
be
wholly
given
to
himself
nor
will
it
be
sufficient
for
you
to
refrain
from
worshipping
any
other
god
unless
you
also
refrain
from
imitating
certain
nefarious
despisers
who
take
the
compendious
method
of
treating
all
religions
with
contempt
but
the
observance
of
this
precept
must
be
preceded
by
true
religion
leading
our
minds
to
the
living
god
that
being
endued
with
the
knowledge
of
him
they
may
aspire
to
admire
fear
and
worship
his
majesty
to
receive
his
communication
of
blessings
to
request
his
aid
upon
all
occasions
to
acknowledge
and
celebrate
the
magnificence
of
his
works
as
the
sole
end
in
all
the
actions
of
our
lives
we
must
also
beware
of
corrupt
superstition
by
which
those
whose
minds
are
diverted
from
the
true
god
are
carried
about
after
various
deities
therefore
if
we
be
contented
with
one
god
let
us
remember
what
has
before
been
observed
that
all
fictitious
deities
must
be
driven
far
away
and
that
we
must
not
divide
that
worship
which
he
claims
exclusively
to
himself
for
it
is
criminal
to
detract
even
the
smallest
portion
from
his
glory
he
must
be
left
in
possession
of
all
that
belongs
to
him
the
following
clause
before
me
aggravates
the
atrociousness
of
the
offence
for
god
is
provoked
to
jealousy
whenever
we
substitute
the
figments
of
our
own
minds
instead
of
him
just
as
an
immodest
woman
by
openly
introducing
an
adulterer
into
the
presence
of
her
husband
would
inflame
his
mind
with
the
greater
resentment
when
god
therefore
by
the
presence
of
his
power
and
grace
gave
a
proof
of
his
regard
to
the
people
whom
he
had
chosen
order
the
more
forcibly
to
deter
them
from
the
crime
of
rebellion
against
him
he
warns
them
of
the
impossibility
of
introducing
new
deities
without
his
being
a
witness
and
spectator
of
the
sacrilege
for
this
presumption
rises
to
the
highest
degree
of
impiety
when
man
imagines
that
he
can
elude
the
observation
of
god
in
his
acts
of
rebellion
god
on
the
contrary
proclaims
that
whatever
we
devise
whatever
we
attempt
whatever
we
perform
is
present
to
his
view
our
conscience
must
therefore
be
pure
even
from
the
most
latent
thoughts
of
apostasy
if
we
wish
our
religion
to
obtain
the
approbation
of
the
lord
for
he
requires
from
us
the
glory
due
to
his
divinity
undiminished
and
uncorrupted
not
only
in
external
confession
but
in
his
own
eyes
which
penetrate
the
inmost
recesses
of
our
hearts
the
second
commandment
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
that
is
in
heaven
above
or
that
is
in
the
earth
beneath
or
that
is
in
the
water
under
the
earth
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
to
them
nor
serve
xvii
as
in
the
preceding
commandment
the
lord
has
declared
himself
to
be
the
one
god
besides
whom
no
other
deities
ought
to
be
imagined
or
worshipped
so
in
this
he
more
clearly
reveals
his
nature
and
the
kind
of
worship
with
which
he
ought
to
be
honoured
that
we
may
not
dare
to
form
any
carnal
conceptions
of
him
the
end
therefore
of
this
precept
is
that
he
will
not
have
his
legitimate
worship
profaned
with
superstitious
rites
wherefore
in
a
word
he
calls
us
off
and
wholly
abstracts
us
from
carnal
observances
which
our
foolish
minds
are
accustomed
to
devise
when
they
conceive
of
god
according
to
the
grossness
of
their
own
apprehensions
and
therefore
he
calls
us
to
the
service
which
rightfully
belongs
to
him
that
is
the
spiritual
worship
which
he
has
instituted
he
marks
what
is
the
grossest
transgression
of
this
kind
that
is
external
idolatry
and
this
precept
consists
of
two
parts
the
first
restrains
us
from
licentiously
daring
to
make
god
who
is
incomprehensible
the
subject
of
our
senses
or
to
represent
him
under
any
visible
form
the
second
prohibits
us
from
paying
religious
adoration
to
any
images
he
likewise
briefly
enumerates
all
the
forms
in
which
he
used
to
be
represented
by
profane
and
superstitious
nations
by
those
things
which
are
in
heaven
he
means
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
other
stars
and
perhaps
birds
as
when
he
explains
his
meaning
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
deuteronomy
he
mentions
birds
as
well
as
the
stars
this
i
should
not
have
remarked
had
i
not
known
some
persons
injudiciously
refer
this
clause
to
angels
i
omit
the
other
particulars
as
needing
no
explanation
and
in
the
first
book
we
have
already
sufficiently
proved
that
whatever
visible
representations
of
god
are
invented
by
man
are
diametrically
opposite
to
his
nature
and
that
therefore
as
soon
as
ever
idols
are
introduced
true
religion
is
immediately
corrupted
and
adulterated
xviii
the
penal
sanction
which
is
annexed
ought
to
have
no
small
influence
in
arousing
us
from
our
lethargy
he
thus
threatens
i
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
and
showing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
and
keep
my
this
is
equivalent
to
a
declaration
that
it
is
to
him
alone
that
we
ought
to
adhere
and
to
urge
us
to
it
he
announces
his
power
which
he
permits
none
with
impunity
to
despise
or
undervalue
for
the
hebrew
word
which
is
here
used
for
god
is
expressive
of
strength
in
the
second
place
he
calls
himself
a
jealous
god
who
can
bear
no
rival
thirdly
he
declares
that
he
will
avenge
his
majesty
and
glory
on
those
who
transfer
it
to
creatures
or
to
graven
images
and
that
not
with
the
transient
punishment
of
the
original
transgressors
only
but
of
their
posterity
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
that
is
of
those
who
shall
imitate
the
impiety
of
their
fathers
as
he
also
permanently
displays
his
mercy
and
goodness
through
a
long
line
of
posterity
to
those
who
love
him
and
keep
his
law
it
is
very
common
for
god
to
assume
the
character
of
a
husband
to
us
for
the
union
in
which
he
connects
us
with
himself
when
he
receives
us
into
the
bosom
of
his
church
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
sacred
conjugal
relation
which
requires
to
be
supported
by
mutual
fidelity
as
he
performs
towards
us
all
the
duties
of
a
true
and
faithful
husband
so
he
demands
from
us
the
reciprocal
duties
of
conjugal
love
and
chastity
that
is
that
we
do
not
prostitute
our
souls
to
satan
to
lust
and
to
the
impurity
of
the
carnal
appetites
wherefore
when
he
reproves
the
apostasy
of
the
jews
he
complains
that
they
had
discarded
chastity
and
were
polluted
with
adulteries
therefore
as
a
husband
in
proportion
to
the
superiority
of
his
purity
and
chastity
is
the
more
grievously
incensed
if
he
perceive
the
affection
of
his
wife
inclining
to
a
rival
so
the
lord
who
has
in
truth
espoused
us
to
himself
declares
that
he
feels
the
most
ardent
jealousy
whenever
we
neglect
the
sacred
purity
of
his
conjugal
relation
to
us
and
defile
ourselves
with
criminal
lusts
but
especially
when
we
transfer
to
any
other
or
adulterate
with
any
superstition
the
worship
of
his
majesty
which
ought
to
be
preserved
in
the
most
consummate
perfection
since
by
such
conduct
we
not
only
violate
the
faith
pledged
in
our
nuptials
but
even
pollute
our
souls
with
spiritual
adultery
xix
let
us
inquire
what
he
intends
by
his
threatening
to
visit
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
to
the
third
and
fourth
for
besides
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
equity
of
the
divine
justice
to
inflict
upon
an
innocent
person
the
punishment
due
to
the
offences
of
another
god
himself
declares
that
the
son
shall
not
bear
the
iniquity
of
the
but
this
expression
is
repeated
more
than
once
concerning
a
deferring
to
future
generations
of
the
punishments
of
crimes
committed
by
their
ancestors
for
moses
frequently
speaks
of
the
lord
visiting
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
and
fourth
in
like
manner
jeremiah
thou
showest
unto
thousands
and
recompensest
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
into
the
bosom
of
their
children
after
some
who
labour
very
hard
to
solve
this
difficulty
are
of
opinion
that
its
meaning
is
to
be
confined
to
temporal
punishments
which
if
children
sustain
through
the
sins
of
their
parents
there
is
nothing
absurd
in
it
because
they
frequently
conduce
to
the
salvation
of
those
on
whom
they
are
inflicted
this
is
certainly
true
for
isaiah
denounced
to
hezekiah
that
on
account
of
the
sin
which
he
had
committed
his
sons
should
be
despoiled
of
the
kingdom
and
carried
away
into
exile
the
families
of
pharaoh
and
abimelech
are
afflicted
on
account
of
the
injury
sustained
by
abraham
but
when
this
is
adduced
as
a
solution
of
these
questions
it
is
rather
an
evasion
of
it
than
a
proper
explanation
for
in
this
and
in
similar
places
the
lord
threatens
a
punishment
too
great
to
be
terminated
by
the
limits
of
the
present
life
it
must
therefore
be
understood
as
a
declaration
that
the
curse
of
the
lord
righteously
rests
not
only
on
the
person
of
an
impious
man
but
also
on
his
whole
family
where
it
has
rested
what
can
be
expected
but
that
the
father
being
destitute
of
the
spirit
of
god
will
lead
a
most
flagitious
life
and
that
the
son
experiencing
in
consequence
of
the
iniquity
of
his
father
a
similar
dereliction
by
the
lord
will
pursue
the
same
path
to
perdition
and
that
the
grandson
and
the
great
grandson
the
execrable
posterity
of
detestable
men
will
run
headlong
after
them
down
the
same
precipice
of
destruction
xx
first
let
us
inquire
whether
such
punishment
be
inconsistent
with
the
divine
justice
if
the
whole
nature
of
man
be
worthy
of
condemnation
we
know
that
destruction
awaits
those
who
are
not
favoured
by
the
lord
with
the
communication
of
his
grace
nevertheless
they
perish
through
their
own
iniquity
and
not
through
the
unjust
hatred
of
god
nor
is
there
any
room
left
for
expostulation
why
they
are
not
assisted
by
divine
grace
to
obtain
salvation
as
well
as
others
since
it
is
a
punishment
therefore
inflicted
on
the
impious
and
flagitious
in
consequence
of
their
transgressions
that
their
families
remain
destitute
of
divine
grace
for
many
generations
who
can
bring
any
accusation
against
god
for
this
most
righteous
instance
of
his
vengeance
but
it
will
be
said
the
lord
declares
on
the
contrary
that
the
punishment
of
the
sin
of
the
father
shall
not
be
transferred
to
the
son
observe
the
subject
that
is
treated
of
in
that
place
the
israelites
after
they
had
been
long
harassed
by
numerous
and
unceasing
calamities
began
to
use
this
proverb
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
s
teeth
are
set
on
edge
by
which
they
insinuated
that
sins
had
been
committed
by
their
parents
the
punishment
of
which
was
inflicted
on
them
who
were
otherwise
righteous
and
innocent
more
through
the
implacable
wrath
of
god
than
through
a
just
severity
the
prophet
announces
to
them
that
this
is
not
the
case
but
that
they
are
punished
for
their
own
transgressions
and
that
it
is
incompatible
with
the
divine
justice
to
punish
a
righteous
son
for
the
iniquity
of
a
wicked
father
nor
is
this
to
be
found
in
the
penal
sanction
now
under
consideration
for
if
the
visitation
of
which
we
are
treating
be
fulfilled
when
god
removes
from
the
family
of
the
impious
his
grace
the
light
of
his
truth
and
the
other
means
of
salvation
the
very
circumstance
of
children
blinded
and
abandoned
by
him
being
found
treading
in
the
footsteps
of
their
fathers
is
an
instance
of
their
bearing
the
curse
in
consequence
of
the
crimes
of
their
parents
but
their
being
the
subjects
of
temporal
miseries
and
at
length
of
eternal
perdition
are
punishments
from
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
not
for
the
sins
of
others
but
on
account
of
their
own
iniquity
xxi
on
the
other
hand
god
gives
a
promise
to
extend
his
mercy
to
a
thousand
generations
which
also
frequently
occurs
in
the
scripture
and
is
inserted
in
the
solemn
covenant
with
the
church
i
will
be
a
god
unto
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
in
allusion
to
this
solomon
says
that
the
children
of
the
just
man
are
blessed
after
him
not
only
as
the
effect
of
a
religious
education
which
is
of
no
small
importance
but
also
in
consequence
of
the
blessing
promised
in
the
covenant
that
the
grace
of
god
shall
perpetually
remain
in
the
families
of
the
pious
this
is
a
source
of
peculiar
consolation
to
the
faithful
but
to
the
impious
of
great
terror
for
if
even
after
death
the
memory
of
righteousness
and
iniquity
has
so
much
influence
with
god
that
the
curse
of
the
one
and
the
blessing
of
the
other
will
redound
to
posterity
much
more
will
it
remain
on
the
persons
of
the
actors
themselves
now
it
is
no
objection
to
our
argument
that
the
descendants
of
the
impious
sometimes
grow
better
while
those
of
the
faithful
degenerate
since
the
legislator
never
intended
to
establish
in
this
case
such
an
invariable
rule
as
would
derogate
from
his
own
free
choice
for
it
is
sufficient
for
the
consolation
of
the
righteous
and
the
terror
of
the
sinner
that
the
denunciation
is
not
vain
or
inefficacious
although
it
be
not
always
executed
for
as
the
temporal
punishments
inflicted
on
a
few
wicked
men
are
testimonies
of
the
divine
wrath
against
sin
and
of
the
judgment
that
will
hereafter
be
pronounced
on
all
sinners
though
many
escape
with
impunity
even
to
the
end
of
their
lives
so
when
the
lord
exhibits
one
example
of
this
blessing
in
manifesting
his
mercy
and
goodness
to
the
son
for
the
sake
of
his
father
he
affords
a
proof
of
his
constant
and
perpetual
favour
to
his
worshippers
and
when
in
any
one
instance
he
pursues
the
iniquity
of
the
father
in
the
son
he
shows
what
a
judgment
awaits
all
the
reprobate
on
account
of
their
own
transgressions
the
certainty
of
which
was
what
he
principally
designed
in
this
passage
he
also
gives
us
a
cursory
intimation
of
the
greatness
of
his
mercy
which
he
extends
to
a
thousand
generations
while
he
has
assigned
only
four
generations
to
his
vengeance
the
third
commandment
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
xxii
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
the
lord
will
have
the
majesty
of
his
name
to
be
held
inviolably
sacred
by
us
the
substance
of
the
command
therefore
is
that
we
ought
not
to
profane
that
name
by
a
contemptuous
or
irreverent
use
of
it
this
prohibition
necessarily
implies
an
injunction
that
we
studiously
and
carefully
treat
it
with
religious
veneration
therefore
it
becomes
us
to
regulate
our
thoughts
and
words
in
such
a
manner
that
we
may
not
think
or
speak
any
thing
concerning
god
and
his
mysteries
but
with
the
greatest
sobriety
and
reverence
that
in
meditating
on
his
works
we
may
form
no
opinion
that
is
dishonourable
to
him
these
three
things
i
say
we
ought
most
carefully
to
that
whatever
we
think
and
whatever
we
say
of
him
should
savour
of
his
excellence
correspond
to
the
sacred
sublimity
of
his
name
and
tend
to
the
exaltation
of
his
magnificence
secondly
we
should
not
rashly
and
preposterously
abuse
his
holy
word
and
adorable
mysteries
to
the
purposes
of
ambition
of
avarice
or
of
amusement
but
as
they
bear
an
impression
of
the
dignity
of
his
name
they
should
always
receive
from
us
the
honour
and
esteem
which
belong
to
them
lastly
we
should
not
injure
his
works
by
obloquy
or
detraction
as
some
miserable
mortals
are
accustomed
to
do
but
whenever
we
mention
any
thing
done
by
him
we
should
celebrate
it
with
encomiums
of
wisdom
justice
and
goodness
this
is
sanctifying
the
name
of
god
in
every
other
case
it
is
violated
by
a
vain
and
criminal
abuse
because
it
is
carried
beyond
the
limits
of
that
legitimate
use
to
which
alone
it
is
consecrated
and
though
no
other
consequence
ensue
it
is
deprived
of
its
dignity
and
by
degrees
rendered
contemptible
but
if
it
be
so
criminal
thus
rashly
and
unseasonably
to
introduce
the
name
of
god
on
every
occasion
much
more
so
must
it
be
to
apply
it
to
such
nefarious
uses
as
they
do
who
make
it
subservient
to
the
superstitions
of
necromancy
to
horrible
imprecations
to
unlawful
exorcisms
and
to
other
impious
incantations
but
an
oath
is
the
thing
principally
contemplated
in
the
command
as
the
most
detestable
instance
of
the
perverse
abuse
of
the
divine
name
and
this
is
done
to
inspire
us
with
the
greater
horror
of
every
species
of
profanation
of
it
that
this
precept
relates
to
the
worship
of
god
and
the
reverence
of
his
name
and
not
to
the
equity
that
ought
to
be
observed
among
mankind
appears
from
the
subsequent
condemnation
in
the
second
table
of
perjury
and
false
witness
by
which
society
is
injured
would
be
a
needless
repetition
if
the
present
precept
related
to
a
civil
duty
besides
the
division
of
the
law
requires
this
for
as
we
have
already
observed
it
is
not
in
vain
that
god
has
distributed
the
law
into
two
tables
whence
we
conclude
that
in
this
command
he
vindicates
his
just
claims
and
guards
the
sanctity
of
his
name
but
does
not
teach
the
duties
which
men
owe
to
each
other
xxiii
in
the
first
place
we
have
to
explain
what
an
oath
is
it
consists
in
calling
upon
god
as
a
witness
to
confirm
the
truth
of
any
declaration
that
we
make
for
execrations
which
contain
manifest
reproaches
against
god
are
not
worthy
to
be
mentioned
among
oaths
that
such
an
attestation
when
rightly
performed
is
a
species
of
divine
worship
is
evident
from
many
places
of
scripture
as
when
isaiah
prophesies
of
the
vocation
of
the
assyrians
and
egyptians
to
participate
in
the
covenant
with
israel
they
shall
speak
says
he
the
language
of
canaan
and
swear
to
the
lord
of
by
swearing
to
the
lord
here
is
intended
making
a
profession
of
religion
again
when
he
speaks
of
the
extension
of
his
kingdom
he
who
blesseth
himself
in
the
earth
shall
bless
himself
in
the
god
of
truth
and
he
that
sweareth
in
the
earth
shall
swear
by
the
god
of
jeremiah
says
if
they
will
diligently
learn
the
ways
of
my
people
to
swear
by
my
name
the
lord
liveth
as
they
taught
my
people
to
swear
by
baal
then
shall
they
be
built
in
the
midst
of
my
and
we
are
justly
said
to
profess
our
religion
to
the
lord
when
we
invoke
his
name
to
bear
witness
to
us
for
thereby
we
confess
that
he
is
truth
itself
eternal
and
immutable
whom
we
call
not
only
as
a
witness
of
the
truth
excelling
all
others
but
also
as
the
only
defender
of
it
who
is
able
to
bring
to
light
things
which
are
concealed
and
in
a
word
as
the
searcher
of
all
hearts
for
where
human
testimonies
are
wanting
we
resort
for
refuge
to
the
testimony
of
god
and
particularly
when
any
thing
is
to
be
affirmed
which
is
hidden
in
the
conscience
for
which
reason
the
lord
is
extremely
angry
with
them
who
swear
by
strange
gods
and
interprets
that
species
of
swearing
as
a
proof
of
manifest
defection
from
him
thy
children
have
forsaken
me
and
sworn
by
them
that
are
no
and
he
declares
the
atrociousness
of
this
crime
by
his
denunciation
of
punishment
i
will
cut
off
them
that
swear
by
the
lord
and
that
swear
by
xxiv
now
since
we
understand
it
to
be
the
will
of
the
lord
that
we
should
reverence
his
name
in
our
oaths
we
ought
to
use
so
much
the
more
caution
lest
instead
of
reverence
they
betray
dishonour
or
contempt
of
it
it
is
no
trifling
insult
to
him
when
perjury
is
committed
in
his
name
and
therefore
the
law
calls
it
a
profanation
but
what
remains
to
the
lord
when
he
is
despoiled
of
his
truth
he
will
then
cease
to
be
god
but
he
is
certainly
despoiled
of
it
when
he
is
made
an
abettor
and
approver
of
a
falsehood
wherefore
when
joshua
would
induce
achan
to
a
confession
of
the
truth
he
says
my
son
give
i
pray
thee
glory
to
the
lord
god
of
israel
implying
in
this
that
the
lord
is
grievously
dishonoured
if
perjury
be
committed
in
his
name
nor
is
this
strange
for
in
such
a
case
we
do
all
that
is
in
our
power
to
brand
his
sacred
name
with
a
falsehood
and
that
this
form
of
expression
was
customary
among
the
jews
whenever
any
man
was
called
to
take
an
oath
appears
from
a
similar
adjuration
used
by
the
pharisees
in
the
gospel
of
john
to
this
caution
we
are
accustomed
by
the
forms
of
oaths
which
are
used
in
the
scriptures
the
lord
liveth
god
do
so
and
more
also
to
me
i
call
god
for
a
record
upon
my
soul
which
imply
that
we
can
not
invoke
god
to
be
a
witness
to
our
declarations
without
imprecating
his
vengeance
upon
us
if
we
be
guilty
of
perjury
xxv
the
name
of
god
is
rendered
vile
and
contemptible
when
it
is
used
in
unnecessarily
swearing
even
to
what
is
true
for
in
this
instance
also
it
is
taken
in
vain
wherefore
it
will
not
be
sufficient
to
abstain
from
perjury
unless
we
also
remember
that
swearing
is
permitted
and
appointed
not
for
the
sake
of
our
pleasure
or
caprice
but
from
necessity
and
that
the
lawful
use
of
it
therefore
is
transgressed
by
those
who
apply
it
to
cases
where
it
is
not
necessary
now
no
other
necessity
can
be
pretended
but
when
we
want
to
serve
either
religion
or
charity
this
crime
in
the
present
day
is
carried
to
a
very
great
extent
and
it
is
so
much
the
more
intolerable
since
by
its
frequency
it
has
ceased
to
be
considered
as
a
crime
though
before
the
divine
tribunal
it
is
deemed
no
trivial
offence
for
the
name
of
god
is
universally
profaned
without
concern
in
trifling
conversations
and
it
is
not
considered
as
sinful
because
this
presumptuous
wickedness
has
been
so
long
practised
with
impunity
but
the
divine
command
remains
valid
the
sanction
remains
firm
and
a
future
day
will
witness
the
completion
of
that
part
of
it
which
denounces
a
particular
punishment
against
those
who
take
his
name
in
vain
this
precept
is
violated
also
in
another
way
if
in
our
oaths
we
substitute
the
servants
of
god
in
the
place
of
god
himself
we
are
guilty
of
manifest
impiety
because
we
thereby
transfer
to
them
the
glory
due
to
the
deity
nor
is
it
without
reason
that
god
by
a
special
command
enjoins
us
to
swear
by
his
name
and
by
a
special
prohibition
interdicts
us
from
swearing
by
any
strange
gods
and
the
apostle
evidently
attests
the
same
when
he
says
that
men
swear
by
the
greater
but
that
god
because
he
could
swear
by
no
greater
sware
by
xxvi
the
anabaptists
not
satisfied
with
this
limitation
of
oaths
condemn
all
oaths
without
exception
because
the
prohibition
of
christ
is
general
i
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
but
let
your
communication
be
yea
yea
nay
nay
for
whatsoever
is
more
than
these
cometh
of
but
by
this
mode
of
interpretation
they
set
christ
in
opposition
to
the
father
as
though
he
descended
into
this
world
to
abrogate
the
father
s
decrees
for
in
the
law
the
eternal
god
not
only
permits
an
oath
as
a
lawful
thing
which
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
the
use
of
it
but
in
cases
of
necessity
commands
it
now
christ
asserts
that
he
and
his
father
are
one
that
he
acts
only
according
to
the
commands
of
the
father
that
his
doctrine
is
not
of
himself
what
then
will
they
make
god
to
contradict
himself
by
prohibiting
and
condemning
in
our
conduct
that
which
he
has
before
approved
and
enjoined
but
as
the
words
of
christ
involve
some
difficulty
let
us
enter
on
a
brief
examination
of
them
here
we
shall
never
arrive
at
the
truth
unless
we
attend
to
the
design
of
christ
and
advert
to
the
subject
of
which
he
is
there
treating
his
design
is
not
to
relax
or
to
restrict
the
law
but
to
reduce
it
to
its
true
and
genuine
meaning
which
had
been
very
much
corrupted
by
the
false
comments
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
if
we
bear
this
in
our
minds
we
shall
not
be
of
opinion
that
christ
condemned
all
oaths
but
only
those
which
transgress
the
rule
of
the
law
it
appears
to
have
been
the
custom
of
the
people
at
that
time
to
avoid
nothing
but
perjuries
whereas
the
law
forbids
not
only
perjuries
but
likewise
all
vain
and
superfluous
oaths
our
lord
therefore
that
infallible
expositor
of
the
law
apprizes
them
that
it
is
sinful
not
only
to
perjure
themselves
but
even
to
swear
to
swear
in
what
manner
in
vain
but
the
oaths
which
are
sanctioned
in
the
law
he
leaves
without
any
objection
they
consider
themselves
as
urging
a
very
powerful
argument
when
they
violently
insist
on
the
particle
which
nevertheless
refers
not
to
the
word
but
to
the
forms
of
oaths
that
are
there
subjoined
for
the
error
there
condemned
consisted
partly
in
a
supposition
that
in
swearing
by
heaven
and
earth
there
was
no
interference
with
the
name
of
god
therefore
after
the
principal
instance
of
transgression
the
lord
goes
on
to
destroy
all
their
subterfuges
that
they
may
not
imagine
themselves
to
have
escaped
by
suppressing
the
name
of
god
and
calling
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
for
them
for
here
by
the
way
it
must
be
remarked
that
men
indirectly
swear
by
god
though
his
name
is
not
expressed
as
when
they
swear
by
the
light
of
life
by
the
bread
which
they
eat
by
their
baptism
or
by
any
other
blessings
which
they
have
received
from
the
divine
munificence
nor
does
christ
in
that
place
prohibit
them
from
swearing
by
heaven
and
earth
and
jerusalem
in
order
to
correct
superstition
as
some
falsely
imagine
but
rather
to
confute
the
sophistical
subtlety
of
persons
who
thought
there
was
no
crime
in
the
foolish
use
of
indirect
oaths
as
though
they
were
not
chargeable
with
profaning
the
sacred
name
of
god
which
is
engraven
however
on
all
his
benefits
but
the
case
is
different
where
any
mortal
man
or
one
that
is
dead
or
an
angel
is
substituted
in
the
place
of
god
as
among
idolatrous
nations
adulation
invented
that
odious
form
of
swearing
by
the
life
or
genius
of
a
king
because
in
such
cases
the
deification
of
a
creature
obscures
and
diminishes
the
glory
of
the
only
true
god
but
when
we
mean
nothing
but
to
derive
a
confirmation
to
our
assertions
from
the
sacred
name
of
god
although
it
be
done
in
an
indirect
manner
yet
all
such
frivolous
oaths
are
offensive
to
his
majesty
christ
deprives
this
licentious
practice
of
every
vain
excuse
by
his
prohibition
of
swearing
at
all
james
also
aims
at
the
same
point
where
he
uses
the
language
of
christ
which
i
have
cited
because
this
presumption
has
always
been
prevalent
in
the
world
notwithstanding
it
is
a
profanation
of
the
name
of
god
for
if
you
refer
the
particle
to
the
substance
of
swearing
as
though
every
oath
without
exception
were
unlawful
what
means
the
explanation
which
is
immediately
annexed
neither
by
heaven
neither
by
earth
language
evidently
used
in
refutation
of
those
cavils
which
the
jews
considered
as
furnishing
an
excuse
for
their
sin
xxvii
it
can
no
longer
be
doubtful
therefore
to
persons
of
sound
judgment
that
the
lord
in
that
passage
only
condemns
those
oaths
which
had
been
forbidden
by
the
law
for
even
he
who
exhibited
in
his
life
an
example
of
the
perfection
which
he
inculcated
hesitated
not
to
make
use
of
oaths
whenever
occasion
required
and
his
disciples
who
we
doubt
not
were
obedient
to
their
master
in
all
things
followed
the
same
example
who
can
dare
to
assert
that
paul
would
have
sworn
if
all
oaths
had
been
prohibited
but
when
the
occasion
requires
it
he
swears
without
any
scruple
and
sometimes
even
adds
an
imprecation
the
question
however
is
not
yet
decided
for
it
is
the
opinion
of
some
persons
that
public
oaths
are
the
only
exceptions
from
this
prohibition
such
as
we
take
when
required
by
a
magistrate
such
also
as
princes
are
accustomed
to
use
in
ratifying
treaties
or
subjects
when
they
swear
allegiance
to
their
princes
or
soldiers
as
a
military
test
and
others
of
a
similar
kind
to
this
class
also
they
justly
refer
those
oaths
which
we
find
used
by
paul
in
assertion
of
the
dignity
of
the
gospel
because
the
apostles
in
the
exercise
of
their
functions
were
not
private
persons
but
public
ministers
of
god
and
indeed
i
will
not
deny
that
these
are
the
safest
oaths
because
they
are
sanctioned
by
the
strongest
testimonies
of
scripture
a
magistrate
is
directed
in
a
dubious
case
to
put
a
witness
to
his
oath
and
the
witness
on
the
other
hand
is
required
to
answer
on
his
oath
and
the
apostle
says
that
human
controversies
are
adjusted
by
this
expedient
in
this
precept
both
parties
are
furnished
with
a
complete
justification
of
their
conduct
moreover
we
may
observe
that
among
the
ancient
heathen
a
public
and
solemn
oath
was
held
in
great
reverence
but
that
common
ones
which
they
used
in
their
ordinary
intercourse
were
not
esteemed
of
any
or
of
much
importance
because
they
imagined
that
these
were
not
regarded
by
the
divine
majesty
but
it
would
be
too
dangerous
to
condemn
private
oaths
which
are
taken
in
cases
of
necessity
with
sobriety
integrity
and
reverence
since
they
are
supported
both
by
reason
and
by
scriptural
examples
for
if
it
be
lawful
for
private
persons
in
an
important
and
serious
affair
to
appeal
to
god
as
a
judge
between
them
much
more
must
it
be
allowable
to
invoke
him
as
a
witness
your
brother
will
accuse
you
of
perfidy
you
endeavour
to
exculpate
yourself
he
will
not
permit
himself
by
any
means
to
be
satisfied
if
your
reputation
be
endangered
by
his
obstinate
malignity
you
may
without
any
offence
appeal
to
the
judgment
of
god
that
in
his
own
time
he
will
manifest
your
innocence
if
the
words
be
strictly
examined
it
is
a
less
thing
to
appeal
to
him
as
a
witness
than
as
a
judge
i
see
not
therefore
why
we
should
assert
such
an
appeal
to
him
to
be
unlawful
there
are
not
wanting
numerous
examples
of
it
if
the
oath
of
abraham
and
isaac
with
abimelech
be
alleged
to
have
been
taken
in
a
public
capacity
certainly
jacob
and
laban
were
private
persons
and
yet
they
confirmed
the
covenant
between
them
by
a
mutual
oath
boaz
was
a
private
person
who
confirmed
in
the
same
manner
his
promise
of
marriage
to
ruth
obadiah
was
a
private
person
a
righteous
man
and
one
that
feared
the
lord
who
declared
with
an
oath
the
fact
of
which
he
wished
to
convince
elijah
i
can
find
therefore
no
better
rule
than
that
we
regulate
our
oaths
in
such
a
manner
that
they
be
not
rash
or
inconsiderate
wanton
or
frivolous
but
used
in
cases
of
real
necessity
as
for
vindicating
the
glory
of
the
lord
or
promoting
the
edification
of
our
brother
which
is
the
end
of
this
commandment
of
the
law
the
fourth
commandment
the
sabbath
day
to
keep
it
holy
six
days
shalt
thou
labour
and
do
all
thy
work
but
the
seventh
day
is
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
it
thou
shalt
not
do
any
work
xxviii
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
being
dead
to
our
own
affections
and
works
we
should
meditate
on
the
kingdom
of
god
and
be
exercised
in
that
meditation
in
the
observance
of
his
institutions
but
as
it
has
an
aspect
peculiar
and
distinct
from
the
others
it
requires
a
little
different
kind
of
exposition
the
fathers
frequently
call
it
a
because
it
contains
the
external
observance
of
the
day
which
was
abolished
with
the
rest
of
the
figures
at
the
advent
of
christ
and
there
is
much
truth
in
their
observation
but
it
reaches
only
half
of
the
subject
wherefore
it
is
necessary
to
seek
further
for
an
exposition
and
to
consider
three
causes
on
which
i
think
i
have
observed
this
commandment
to
rest
for
it
was
the
design
of
the
heavenly
lawgiver
under
the
rest
of
the
seventh
day
to
give
the
people
of
israel
a
figure
of
the
spiritual
rest
by
which
the
faithful
ought
to
refrain
from
their
own
works
in
order
to
leave
god
to
work
within
them
his
design
was
secondly
that
there
should
be
a
stated
day
on
which
they
might
assemble
together
to
hear
the
law
and
perform
the
ceremonies
or
at
least
which
they
might
especially
devote
to
meditations
on
his
works
that
by
this
recollection
they
might
be
led
to
the
exercises
of
piety
thirdly
he
thought
it
right
that
servants
and
persons
living
under
the
jurisdiction
of
others
should
be
indulged
with
a
day
of
rest
that
they
might
enjoy
some
remission
from
their
labour
xxix
yet
we
are
taught
in
many
places
that
this
adumbration
of
the
spiritual
rest
was
the
principal
design
of
the
sabbath
for
the
lord
is
hardly
so
strict
in
his
requisitions
of
obedience
to
any
other
precept
when
he
means
to
intimate
in
the
prophets
that
religion
is
totally
subverted
he
complains
that
his
sabbaths
are
polluted
violated
neglected
and
profaned
as
though
in
case
of
that
duty
being
neglected
there
remained
no
other
way
in
which
he
could
be
honoured
on
the
other
hand
he
notices
the
observance
of
it
with
singular
encomiums
wherefore
also
among
the
other
divine
communications
the
faithful
used
very
highly
to
esteem
the
revelation
of
the
sabbath
for
this
is
the
language
of
the
levites
in
a
solemn
assembly
recorded
by
nehemiah
thou
madest
known
unto
our
fathers
thy
holy
sabbath
and
commandedst
them
precepts
statutes
and
laws
by
the
hand
of
we
see
the
singular
estimation
in
which
it
is
held
above
all
the
commandments
of
the
law
all
these
things
tend
to
display
the
dignity
of
the
mystery
which
is
beautifully
expressed
by
moses
and
ezekiel
in
exodus
we
read
as
follows
verily
my
sabbaths
ye
shall
keep
for
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
you
throughout
your
generations
that
ye
may
know
that
i
am
the
lord
that
doth
sanctify
you
ye
shall
keep
the
sabbath
therefore
for
it
is
holy
unto
you
the
children
of
israel
shall
keep
the
sabbath
to
observe
the
sabbath
throughout
their
generations
for
a
perpetual
covenant
it
is
a
sign
between
me
and
the
children
of
israel
for
this
is
more
fully
expressed
by
ezekiel
but
the
substance
of
what
he
says
is
that
the
sabbath
was
a
sign
by
which
the
israelites
might
know
that
god
was
their
sanctifier
if
our
sanctification
consists
properly
in
the
mortification
of
our
own
will
there
is
a
very
natural
analogy
between
the
external
sign
and
the
internal
thing
which
it
represents
we
must
rest
altogether
that
god
may
operate
within
us
we
must
recede
from
our
own
will
resign
our
own
heart
and
renounce
all
our
carnal
affections
in
short
we
must
cease
from
all
the
efforts
of
our
own
understanding
that
having
god
operating
within
us
we
may
enjoy
rest
in
him
as
we
are
also
taught
by
the
apostle
xxx
this
perpetual
cessation
was
represented
to
the
jews
by
the
observance
of
one
day
in
seven
which
the
lord
in
order
that
it
might
be
the
more
religiously
kept
recommended
by
his
own
example
for
it
is
no
small
stimulus
to
any
action
for
a
man
to
know
that
he
is
imitating
his
creator
if
any
one
inquire
after
a
hidden
signification
in
the
septenary
number
it
is
probable
that
because
in
scripture
it
is
the
number
of
perfection
it
is
here
selected
to
denote
perpetual
duration
this
is
confirmed
also
by
the
circumstance
that
moses
with
that
day
in
which
he
narrates
that
the
lord
rested
from
his
works
concludes
his
description
of
the
succession
of
days
and
nights
we
may
also
adduce
another
probable
conjecture
respecting
this
the
lord
intended
to
signify
that
the
sabbath
would
never
be
completed
until
the
arrival
of
the
last
day
for
in
it
we
begin
that
blessed
rest
in
which
we
make
new
advances
from
day
to
day
but
because
we
are
still
engaged
in
a
perpetual
warfare
with
the
flesh
it
will
not
be
consummated
before
the
completion
of
that
prediction
of
isaiah
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
from
one
new
moon
to
another
and
from
one
sabbath
to
another
shall
all
flesh
come
to
worship
before
me
saith
the
lord
that
is
when
god
shall
be
all
in
the
lord
may
be
considered
therefore
as
having
delineated
to
his
people
in
the
seventh
day
the
future
perfection
of
his
sabbath
in
the
last
day
that
by
a
continual
meditation
on
the
sabbath
during
their
whole
life
they
might
be
aspiring
towards
this
perfection
xxxi
if
any
one
disapprove
of
this
observation
on
the
number
as
too
curious
i
object
not
to
its
being
understood
in
a
more
simple
manner
that
the
lord
ordained
a
certain
day
that
the
people
under
the
discipline
of
the
law
might
be
exercised
in
continual
meditations
on
the
spiritual
rest
that
he
appointed
the
seventh
day
either
because
he
foresaw
it
would
be
sufficient
or
in
order
that
the
proposal
of
a
resemblance
to
his
own
example
might
operate
as
a
stronger
stimulus
to
the
people
or
at
least
to
apprize
them
that
the
only
end
of
the
sabbath
was
to
promote
their
conformity
to
their
creator
for
this
is
of
little
importance
provided
we
retain
the
mystery
which
is
principally
exhibited
of
a
perpetual
rest
from
our
own
works
to
the
contemplation
of
this
the
prophets
used
frequently
to
recall
the
jews
that
they
might
not
suppose
themselves
to
have
discharged
their
duty
merely
by
a
cessation
from
manual
labours
beside
the
passages
already
cited
we
have
the
following
in
isaiah
if
thou
turn
away
thy
foot
from
the
sabbath
from
doing
thy
pleasure
on
my
holy
day
and
call
the
sabbath
a
delight
the
holy
of
the
lord
honourable
and
shalt
honour
him
not
doing
thine
own
ways
nor
finding
thine
own
pleasure
nor
speaking
thine
own
words
then
shalt
thou
delight
thyself
in
the
lord
but
all
that
it
contained
of
a
ceremonial
nature
was
without
doubt
abolished
by
the
advent
of
the
lord
christ
for
he
is
the
truth
at
whose
presence
all
figures
disappear
the
body
at
the
sight
of
which
all
the
shadows
are
relinquished
he
i
say
is
the
true
fulfilment
of
the
sabbath
having
been
buried
with
him
by
baptism
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
that
being
partakers
of
his
resurrection
we
may
walk
in
newness
of
therefore
the
apostle
says
in
another
place
that
the
sabbath
was
a
shadow
of
things
to
come
but
the
is
of
christ
that
is
the
real
substance
of
the
truth
which
he
has
beautifully
explained
in
that
passage
this
is
contained
not
in
one
day
but
in
the
whole
course
of
our
life
till
being
wholly
dead
to
ourselves
we
be
filled
with
the
life
of
god
christians
therefore
ought
to
depart
from
all
superstitious
observance
of
days
xxxii
as
the
two
latter
causes
however
ought
not
to
be
numbered
among
the
ancient
shadows
but
are
equally
suitable
to
all
ages
the
sabbath
is
abrogated
yet
it
is
still
customary
among
us
to
assemble
on
stated
days
for
hearing
the
word
for
breaking
the
mystic
bread
and
for
public
prayers
and
also
to
allow
servants
and
labourers
a
remission
from
their
labour
that
in
commanding
the
sabbath
the
lord
had
regard
to
both
these
things
can
not
be
doubted
the
first
is
abundantly
confirmed
even
by
the
practice
of
the
jews
the
second
is
proved
by
moses
in
deuteronomy
in
these
words
that
thy
and
thy
may
rest
as
well
as
thou
and
remember
that
thou
wast
a
servant
in
the
land
of
also
in
exodus
that
thine
ox
and
thine
ass
may
rest
and
the
son
of
thy
handmaid
and
the
stranger
may
be
who
can
deny
that
both
these
things
are
as
proper
for
us
as
for
the
jews
assemblies
of
the
church
are
enjoined
in
the
divine
word
and
the
necessity
of
them
is
sufficiently
known
even
from
the
experience
of
life
unless
there
be
stated
days
appointed
for
them
how
can
they
be
held
according
to
the
direction
of
the
apostle
all
things
are
to
be
done
decently
and
in
order
among
us
but
so
far
is
it
from
being
possible
to
preserve
order
and
decorum
without
this
regulation
that
if
it
were
abolished
the
church
would
be
in
imminent
danger
of
immediate
convulsion
and
ruin
but
if
we
feel
the
same
necessity
to
relieve
which
the
lord
enjoined
the
sabbath
upon
the
jews
let
no
one
plead
that
it
does
not
belong
to
us
for
our
most
provident
and
indulgent
father
has
been
no
less
attentive
to
provide
for
our
necessity
than
for
that
of
the
jews
but
why
it
may
be
asked
do
we
not
rather
assemble
on
every
day
that
so
all
distinction
of
days
may
be
removed
i
sincerely
wish
that
this
were
practised
and
truly
spiritual
wisdom
would
be
well
worthy
of
some
portion
of
time
being
daily
allotted
to
it
but
if
the
infirmity
of
many
persons
will
not
admit
of
daily
assemblies
and
charity
does
not
permit
us
to
require
more
of
them
why
should
we
not
obey
the
rule
which
we
have
imposed
upon
us
by
the
will
of
god
xxxiii
i
am
obliged
to
be
rather
more
diffuse
on
this
point
because
in
the
present
age
some
unquiet
spirits
have
been
raising
noisy
contentions
respecting
the
lord
s
day
they
complain
that
christians
are
tinctured
with
judaism
because
they
retain
any
observance
of
days
but
i
reply
that
the
lord
s
day
is
not
observed
by
us
upon
the
principles
of
judaism
because
in
this
respect
the
difference
between
us
and
the
jews
is
very
great
for
we
celebrate
it
not
with
scrupulous
rigour
as
a
ceremony
which
we
conceive
to
be
a
figure
of
some
spiritual
mystery
but
only
use
it
as
a
remedy
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
order
in
the
church
but
they
say
paul
teaches
that
christians
are
not
to
be
judged
in
the
observance
of
it
because
it
is
a
shadow
of
something
future
therefore
he
is
afraid
lest
he
has
bestowed
on
the
galatians
labour
in
vain
because
they
continued
to
observe
and
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
he
asserts
him
to
be
weak
in
the
faith
who
esteemeth
one
day
above
but
who
these
furious
zealots
only
excepted
does
not
see
what
observance
the
apostle
intends
for
they
did
not
observe
them
for
the
sake
of
political
and
ecclesiastical
order
but
when
they
retained
them
as
shadows
of
spiritual
things
they
were
so
far
guilty
of
obscuring
the
glory
of
christ
and
the
light
of
the
gospel
they
did
not
therefore
rest
from
their
manual
labours
as
from
employments
which
would
divert
them
from
sacred
studies
and
meditations
but
from
a
principle
of
superstition
imagining
their
cessation
from
labour
to
be
still
an
expression
of
reverence
for
the
mysteries
formerly
represented
by
it
this
preposterous
distinction
of
days
the
apostle
strenuously
opposes
and
not
that
legitimate
difference
which
promotes
the
peace
of
the
christian
church
for
in
the
churches
which
he
founded
the
sabbath
was
retained
for
this
purpose
he
prescribes
the
same
day
to
the
corinthians
for
making
collections
for
the
relief
of
the
brethren
at
jerusalem
if
superstition
be
an
object
of
fear
there
was
more
danger
in
the
holy
days
of
the
jews
than
in
the
lord
s
days
now
observed
by
christians
now
whereas
it
was
expedient
for
the
destruction
of
superstition
the
day
which
the
jews
kept
holy
was
abolished
and
it
being
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
decorum
order
and
peace
in
the
christian
church
another
day
was
appointed
for
the
same
use
xxxiv
however
the
ancients
have
not
without
sufficient
reason
substituted
what
we
call
the
lord
s
day
in
the
room
of
the
sabbath
for
since
the
resurrection
of
the
lord
is
the
end
and
consummation
of
that
true
rest
which
was
adumbrated
by
the
ancient
sabbath
the
same
day
which
put
an
end
to
the
shadows
admonishes
christians
not
to
adhere
to
a
shadowy
ceremony
yet
i
do
not
lay
so
much
stress
on
the
septenary
number
that
i
would
oblige
the
church
to
an
invariable
adherence
to
it
nor
will
i
condemn
those
churches
which
have
other
solemn
days
for
their
assemblies
provided
they
keep
at
a
distance
from
superstition
and
this
will
be
the
case
if
they
be
only
designed
for
the
observance
of
discipline
and
order
let
us
sum
up
the
whole
in
the
following
manner
as
the
truth
was
delivered
to
the
jews
under
a
figure
so
it
is
given
to
us
without
any
shadows
first
in
order
that
during
our
whole
life
we
should
meditate
on
a
perpetual
rest
from
our
own
works
that
the
lord
may
operate
within
us
by
his
spirit
secondly
that
every
man
whenever
he
has
leisure
should
diligently
exercise
himself
in
private
in
pious
reflections
on
the
works
of
god
and
also
that
we
should
at
the
same
time
observe
the
legitimate
order
of
the
church
appointed
for
the
hearing
of
the
word
for
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
and
for
public
prayer
thirdly
that
we
should
not
unkindly
oppress
those
who
are
subject
to
us
thus
vanish
all
the
dreams
of
false
prophets
who
in
past
ages
have
infected
the
people
with
a
jewish
notion
affirming
that
nothing
but
the
ceremonial
part
of
this
commandment
which
according
to
them
is
the
appointment
of
the
seventh
day
has
been
abrogated
but
that
the
moral
part
of
it
that
is
the
observance
of
one
day
in
seven
still
remains
but
this
is
only
changing
the
day
in
contempt
of
the
jews
while
they
retain
the
same
opinion
of
the
holiness
of
a
day
for
on
this
principle
the
same
mysterious
signification
would
still
be
attributed
to
particular
days
which
they
formerly
obtained
among
the
jews
and
indeed
we
see
what
advantages
have
arisen
from
such
a
sentiment
for
those
who
adhere
to
it
far
exceed
the
jews
in
a
gross
carnal
and
superstitious
observance
of
the
sabbath
so
that
the
reproofs
which
we
find
in
isaiah
are
equally
applicable
to
them
in
the
present
age
as
to
those
whom
the
prophet
reproved
in
his
time
but
the
principal
thing
to
be
remembered
is
the
general
doctrine
that
lest
religion
decay
or
languish
among
us
sacred
assemblies
ought
diligently
to
be
held
and
that
we
ought
to
use
those
external
means
which
are
adapted
to
support
the
worship
of
god
the
fifth
commandment
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
upon
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
xxxv
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
since
the
lord
god
desires
the
preservation
of
the
order
he
has
appointed
the
degrees
of
preëminence
fixed
by
him
ought
to
be
inviolably
preserved
the
sum
of
it
therefore
will
be
that
we
should
reverence
them
whom
god
has
exalted
to
any
authority
over
us
and
should
render
them
honour
obedience
and
gratitude
whence
follows
a
prohibition
to
derogate
from
their
dignity
by
contempt
obstinacy
or
ingratitude
for
in
the
scripture
the
word
honour
has
an
extensive
signification
as
when
the
apostle
directs
that
the
elders
who
rule
well
be
counted
worthy
of
double
honour
he
means
not
only
that
they
are
entitled
to
reverence
but
likewise
such
a
remuneration
as
their
ministry
deserves
but
as
this
precept
which
enjoins
subjection
to
superiors
is
exceedingly
repugnant
to
the
depravity
of
human
nature
whose
ardent
desire
of
exaltation
will
scarcely
admit
of
subjection
it
has
therefore
proposed
as
an
example
that
kind
of
superiority
which
is
naturally
most
amiable
and
least
invidious
because
that
might
the
more
easily
mollify
and
incline
our
minds
to
a
habit
of
submission
by
that
subjection
therefore
which
is
most
easy
to
be
borne
the
lord
accustoms
us
by
degrees
to
every
kind
of
legitimate
obedience
because
the
reason
of
all
is
the
same
for
to
those
to
whom
he
gives
any
preëminence
he
communicates
his
own
authority
as
far
as
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
that
preëminence
the
titles
of
father
god
and
lord
are
so
eminently
applicable
to
him
that
whenever
we
hear
either
of
them
mentioned
our
minds
can
not
but
be
strongly
affected
with
a
sense
of
his
majesty
those
therefore
on
whom
he
bestows
these
titles
he
illuminates
with
a
ray
of
his
splendour
to
render
them
all
honourable
in
their
respective
stations
thus
in
a
father
we
ought
to
recognize
something
divine
for
it
is
not
without
reason
that
he
bears
one
of
the
titles
of
the
deity
our
prince
or
our
lord
enjoys
an
honour
somewhat
similar
to
that
which
is
given
to
god
xxxvi
wherefore
it
ought
not
to
be
doubted
that
god
here
lays
down
a
universal
rule
for
our
conduct
namely
that
to
every
one
whom
we
know
to
be
placed
in
authority
over
us
by
his
appointment
we
should
render
reverence
obedience
gratitude
and
all
the
other
services
in
our
power
nor
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
they
are
worthy
of
this
honour
or
not
for
whatever
be
their
characters
yet
it
is
not
without
the
appointment
of
the
divine
providence
that
they
have
attained
that
station
on
account
of
which
the
supreme
legislator
has
commanded
them
to
be
honoured
he
has
particularly
enjoined
reverence
to
our
parents
who
have
brought
us
into
this
life
which
nature
itself
ought
to
teach
us
for
those
who
violate
the
parental
authority
by
contempt
or
rebellion
are
not
men
but
monsters
therefore
the
lord
commands
all
those
who
are
disobedient
to
their
parents
to
be
put
to
death
as
having
rendered
themselves
unworthy
to
enjoy
the
light
by
their
disregard
of
those
by
whose
means
they
were
introduced
to
it
and
various
appendices
to
the
law
evince
the
truth
of
our
observation
that
the
honour
here
intended
consists
in
reverence
obedience
and
gratitude
the
first
the
lord
confirms
when
he
commands
him
to
be
slain
who
has
cursed
his
father
or
mother
for
in
that
case
he
punishes
contempt
he
confirms
the
second
when
he
denounces
the
punishment
of
death
against
disobedient
and
rebellious
children
the
third
is
supported
by
christ
who
says
god
commanded
saying
honour
thy
father
and
mother
and
he
that
curseth
father
or
mother
let
him
die
the
death
but
ye
say
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
father
or
his
mother
it
is
a
gift
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me
and
honour
not
his
father
or
his
mother
he
shall
be
free
thus
have
ye
made
the
commandment
of
god
of
none
effect
by
your
and
whenever
paul
mentions
this
commandment
he
explains
it
as
a
requisition
of
obedience
xxxvii
in
order
to
recommend
it
a
promise
is
annexed
which
is
a
further
intimation
how
acceptable
to
god
that
submission
is
which
is
here
enjoined
paul
employs
that
stimulus
to
arouse
our
inattention
when
he
says
this
is
the
first
commandment
with
for
the
preceding
promise
in
the
first
table
was
not
particularly
confined
to
one
commandment
but
extended
to
the
whole
law
now
the
true
explanation
of
this
promise
is
that
the
lord
spake
particularly
to
the
israelites
concerning
the
land
which
he
had
promised
them
as
an
inheritance
if
the
possession
of
that
land
therefore
was
a
pledge
of
the
divine
goodness
we
need
not
wonder
if
it
was
the
lord
s
will
to
manifest
his
favour
by
bestowing
length
of
life
in
order
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
of
the
blessing
conferred
by
him
the
meaning
of
it
therefore
is
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
through
the
space
of
a
long
life
thou
mayest
enjoy
the
possession
of
the
land
which
will
be
to
thee
a
testimony
of
my
favour
but
as
the
whole
earth
is
blessed
to
the
faithful
we
justly
place
the
present
life
among
the
blessings
we
receive
from
god
wherefore
this
promise
belongs
likewise
to
us
inasmuch
as
the
continuance
of
the
present
life
affords
us
a
proof
of
the
divine
benevolence
for
neither
is
it
promised
to
us
nor
was
it
promised
to
the
jews
as
though
it
contained
any
blessedness
in
itself
but
because
to
the
pious
it
is
generally
a
token
of
the
divine
favour
therefore
if
a
son
that
is
obedient
to
his
parents
happen
to
be
removed
out
of
life
before
the
age
of
maturity
is
a
case
of
frequent
occurrence
lord
nevertheless
perseveres
with
as
much
punctuality
in
the
completion
of
his
promise
as
if
he
were
to
reward
a
person
with
a
hundred
acres
of
land
to
whom
he
had
only
promised
one
the
whole
consists
in
this
we
should
consider
that
long
life
is
promised
to
us
so
far
as
it
is
the
blessing
of
god
but
that
it
is
a
blessing
only
as
it
is
a
proof
of
the
favour
of
god
which
he
infinitely
more
richly
and
substantially
testifies
and
actually
demonstrates
to
his
servants
in
their
death
xxxviii
moreover
when
the
lord
promises
the
blessing
of
the
present
life
to
those
children
who
honour
their
parents
with
proper
reverence
he
at
the
same
time
implies
that
a
certain
curse
impends
over
all
those
who
are
disobedient
and
perverse
and
that
it
might
not
fail
of
being
executed
he
pronounces
them
in
his
law
to
be
liable
to
the
sentence
of
death
and
commands
that
punishment
to
be
inflicted
on
them
if
they
escape
that
he
punishes
them
himself
in
some
other
way
for
we
see
what
great
numbers
of
persons
of
this
character
fall
in
battles
and
in
private
quarrels
others
are
afflicted
in
unusual
ways
and
almost
all
of
them
are
proofs
of
the
truth
of
this
threatening
but
if
any
arrive
at
an
extreme
age
being
deprived
of
the
divine
blessing
they
only
languish
in
misery
in
this
life
and
are
reserved
to
greater
punishments
hereafter
and
consequently
they
are
far
from
participating
in
the
blessing
promised
to
dutiful
children
but
it
must
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
we
are
commanded
to
obey
them
only
in
the
lord
and
this
is
evident
from
the
foundation
before
laid
for
they
preside
in
that
station
to
which
the
lord
has
exalted
them
by
communicating
to
them
a
portion
of
his
honour
wherefore
the
submission
exercised
towards
them
ought
to
be
a
step
towards
honouring
the
supreme
father
therefore
if
they
instigate
us
to
any
transgression
of
the
law
we
may
justly
consider
them
not
as
parents
but
as
strangers
who
attempt
to
seduce
us
from
obedience
to
our
real
father
the
same
observation
is
applicable
to
princes
lords
and
superiors
of
every
description
for
it
is
infamous
and
absurd
that
their
eminence
should
avail
to
depreciate
the
preëminence
of
god
upon
which
it
depends
and
to
which
it
ought
to
conduct
us
the
sixth
commandment
shalt
not
xxxix
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
since
god
has
connected
mankind
together
in
a
kind
of
unity
every
man
ought
to
consider
himself
as
charged
with
the
safety
of
all
in
short
then
all
violence
and
injustice
and
every
kind
of
mischief
which
may
injure
the
body
of
our
neighbour
are
forbidden
to
us
and
therefore
we
are
enjoined
if
it
be
in
our
power
to
assist
in
protecting
the
lives
of
our
neighbours
to
exert
ourselves
with
fidelity
for
this
purpose
to
procure
those
things
which
conduce
to
their
tranquillity
to
be
vigilant
in
shielding
them
from
injuries
and
in
cases
of
danger
to
afford
them
our
assistance
if
we
remember
that
this
is
the
language
of
the
divine
legislator
we
should
consider
at
the
same
time
that
he
intends
this
rule
to
govern
the
soul
for
it
were
ridiculous
that
he
who
beholds
the
thoughts
of
the
heart
and
principally
insists
on
them
should
content
himself
with
forming
only
the
body
to
true
righteousness
mental
homicide
therefore
is
likewise
prohibited
and
an
internal
disposition
to
preserve
the
life
of
our
brother
is
commanded
in
this
law
the
hand
indeed
accomplishes
the
homicide
but
it
is
conceived
by
the
mind
under
the
influence
of
anger
and
hatred
examine
whether
you
can
be
angry
with
your
brother
without
being
inflamed
with
a
desire
of
doing
him
some
injury
if
you
can
not
be
angry
with
him
then
you
can
not
hate
him
for
hatred
is
nothing
more
than
inveterate
anger
however
you
may
dissemble
and
endeavour
to
extricate
yourself
by
vain
subterfuges
whenever
there
is
either
anger
or
hatred
there
is
also
a
disposition
to
do
injury
if
you
persist
in
your
evasions
it
is
already
pronounced
by
the
holy
spirit
that
whosoever
hateth
his
brother
is
a
it
is
declared
by
the
lord
christ
that
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
brother
without
a
cause
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
judgment
and
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother
raca
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
council
but
whosoever
shall
say
thou
fool
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
xl
now
the
scripture
states
two
reasons
on
which
this
precept
is
founded
the
first
that
man
is
the
image
of
god
the
second
that
he
is
our
own
flesh
wherefore
unless
we
would
violate
the
image
of
god
we
ought
to
hold
the
personal
safety
of
our
neighbour
inviolably
sacred
and
unless
we
would
divest
ourselves
of
humanity
we
ought
to
cherish
him
as
our
own
flesh
the
motives
which
are
derived
from
the
redemption
and
grace
of
christ
will
be
treated
in
another
place
these
two
characters
which
are
inseparable
from
the
nature
of
man
god
requires
us
to
consider
as
motives
to
our
exertions
for
his
security
so
that
we
may
reverence
his
image
impressed
on
him
and
show
an
affectionate
regard
for
our
own
flesh
that
person
therefore
is
not
innocent
of
the
crime
of
murder
who
has
merely
restrained
himself
from
the
effusion
of
blood
if
you
perpetrate
if
you
attempt
if
you
only
conceive
in
your
mind
any
thing
inimical
to
the
safety
of
another
you
stand
guilty
of
murder
unless
you
also
endeavour
to
defend
him
to
the
utmost
of
your
ability
and
opportunity
you
are
guilty
of
the
same
inhuman
transgression
of
the
law
but
if
so
much
concern
be
discovered
for
the
safety
of
the
body
we
may
conclude
how
much
care
and
attention
should
be
devoted
to
the
safety
of
the
soul
which
in
the
sight
of
god
is
of
infinitely
superior
value
the
seventh
commandment
shalt
not
commit
xli
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
because
god
loves
chastity
and
purity
we
ought
to
depart
from
all
uncleanness
the
sum
of
it
therefore
is
that
we
ought
not
to
be
polluted
by
any
carnal
impurity
or
libidinous
intemperance
to
this
prohibition
corresponds
the
affirmative
injunction
that
every
part
of
our
lives
ought
to
be
regulated
by
chastity
and
continence
but
he
expressly
forbids
adultery
to
which
all
incontinence
tends
in
order
that
by
the
turpitude
of
that
which
is
very
gross
and
palpable
being
an
infamous
pollution
of
the
body
he
may
lead
us
to
abominate
every
unlawful
passion
since
man
was
created
in
such
a
state
as
not
to
live
a
solitary
life
but
to
be
united
to
a
and
moreover
since
the
curse
of
sin
has
increased
this
necessity
lord
has
afforded
us
ample
assistance
in
this
case
by
the
institution
of
connection
which
he
has
not
only
originated
by
his
authority
but
also
sanctified
by
his
blessing
whence
it
appears
that
every
other
union
but
that
of
marriage
is
cursed
in
his
sight
and
that
the
conjugal
union
itself
is
appointed
as
a
remedy
for
our
necessity
that
we
may
not
break
out
into
unrestrained
licentiousness
let
us
not
flatter
ourselves
therefore
since
we
hear
that
there
can
be
no
cohabitation
of
male
and
female
except
in
marriage
without
the
curse
of
god
xlii
now
since
the
original
constitution
of
human
nature
and
the
violence
of
the
passions
consequent
upon
the
fall
have
rendered
a
union
of
the
sexes
doubly
necessary
except
to
those
whom
god
has
exempted
from
that
necessity
by
peculiar
grace
let
every
one
carefully
examine
what
is
given
to
him
virginity
i
acknowledge
is
a
virtue
not
to
be
despised
but
as
this
is
denied
to
some
and
to
others
is
granted
only
for
a
season
let
those
who
are
troubled
with
incontinence
and
can
not
succeed
in
resisting
it
avail
themselves
of
the
help
of
marriage
that
they
may
preserve
their
chastity
according
to
the
degree
of
their
calling
for
persons
who
can
not
receive
this
saying
if
they
do
not
assist
their
frailty
by
the
remedy
offered
and
granted
to
them
oppose
god
and
resist
his
ordinance
here
let
no
one
object
as
many
do
in
the
present
day
that
with
the
help
of
god
he
can
do
all
things
for
the
assistance
of
god
is
granted
only
to
them
who
walk
in
his
ways
that
is
in
their
calling
which
is
deserted
by
all
those
who
neglect
the
means
which
god
has
afforded
them
and
strive
to
overcome
their
necessities
by
vain
presumption
that
continence
is
a
peculiar
gift
of
god
and
of
that
kind
which
is
not
imparted
promiscuously
or
to
the
whole
body
of
the
church
but
only
conferred
on
a
few
of
its
members
is
affirmed
by
our
lord
for
he
mentions
a
certain
class
of
men
who
have
made
themselves
eunuchs
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
sake
that
is
that
they
might
be
more
at
liberty
to
devote
their
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
that
no
one
might
suppose
this
to
be
in
the
power
of
man
he
had
already
declared
that
all
men
can
not
receive
this
saying
save
they
to
whom
it
is
and
he
concludes
he
that
is
able
to
receive
it
let
him
receive
paul
is
still
more
explicit
when
he
says
that
every
man
hath
his
proper
gift
of
god
one
after
this
manner
and
another
after
xliii
since
we
are
so
expressly
apprized
that
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
every
one
to
preserve
chastity
in
celibacy
even
with
the
most
strenuous
efforts
for
that
purpose
and
that
it
is
a
peculiar
grace
which
the
lord
confers
only
on
particular
persons
that
he
may
have
them
more
ready
for
his
service
do
we
not
resist
god
and
strive
against
the
nature
instituted
by
him
unless
we
accommodate
our
manner
of
life
to
the
measure
of
our
ability
in
this
commandment
the
lord
prohibits
adultery
therefore
he
requires
of
us
purity
and
chastity
the
only
way
of
preserving
this
is
that
every
one
should
measure
himself
by
his
own
capacity
let
no
one
rashly
despise
marriage
as
a
thing
useless
or
unnecessary
to
him
let
no
one
prefer
celibacy
unless
he
can
dispense
with
a
wife
and
in
that
state
let
him
not
consult
his
carnal
tranquillity
or
advantage
but
only
that
being
exempted
from
this
restraint
he
may
be
the
more
prompt
and
ready
for
all
the
duties
of
piety
moreover
as
this
benefit
is
conferred
upon
many
persons
only
for
a
season
let
every
one
refrain
from
marriage
as
long
as
he
shall
be
capable
of
supporting
a
life
of
celibacy
when
his
strength
fails
to
overcome
his
passions
let
him
consider
that
the
lord
has
laid
him
under
a
necessity
of
marrying
this
is
evident
from
the
direction
of
the
apostle
to
avoid
fornication
let
every
man
have
his
own
wife
and
let
every
woman
have
her
own
again
if
they
can
not
contain
let
them
here
in
the
first
place
he
signifies
that
the
majority
of
men
are
subject
to
the
vice
of
incontinence
in
the
next
place
of
those
who
are
subject
to
it
he
makes
no
exception
but
enjoins
them
all
to
have
recourse
to
that
sole
remedy
which
obviates
unchastity
those
who
are
incontinent
therefore
if
they
neglect
this
method
of
curing
their
infirmity
are
guilty
of
sin
in
not
obeying
this
injunction
of
the
apostle
and
let
not
him
who
refrains
from
actual
fornication
flatter
himself
as
though
he
could
not
be
charged
with
unchastity
while
his
heart
at
the
same
time
is
inflamed
with
libidinous
desire
for
paul
defines
chastity
to
consist
in
sanctity
of
mind
connected
with
purity
of
body
the
unmarried
woman
he
says
careth
for
the
things
of
the
lord
that
she
may
be
holy
both
in
body
and
in
therefore
when
he
gives
a
reason
to
confirm
the
preceding
injunction
he
does
not
content
himself
with
saying
that
it
is
better
for
a
man
to
marry
than
to
pollute
himself
with
the
society
of
a
harlot
but
affirms
that
it
is
better
to
marry
than
to
xliv
now
if
married
persons
are
satisfied
that
their
society
is
attended
with
the
blessing
of
the
lord
they
are
thereby
admonished
that
it
must
not
be
contaminated
by
libidinous
and
dissolute
intemperance
for
if
the
honour
of
marriage
conceals
the
shame
of
incontinence
it
ought
not
on
that
account
to
be
made
an
incitement
to
it
wherefore
let
it
not
be
supposed
by
married
persons
that
all
things
are
lawful
to
them
every
man
should
observe
sobriety
towards
his
wife
and
every
wife
reciprocally
towards
her
husband
conducting
themselves
in
such
a
manner
as
to
do
nothing
unbecoming
the
decorum
and
temperance
of
marriage
for
thus
ought
marriage
contracted
in
the
lord
to
be
regulated
by
moderation
and
modesty
and
not
to
break
out
into
the
vilest
lasciviousness
such
sensuality
has
been
stigmatized
by
ambrose
with
a
severe
but
not
unmerited
censure
when
he
calls
those
who
in
their
conjugal
intercourse
have
no
regard
to
modesty
or
decorum
the
adulterers
of
their
own
wives
lastly
let
us
consider
who
the
legislator
is
by
whom
adultery
is
here
condemned
it
is
no
other
than
he
who
ought
to
have
the
entire
possession
of
us
and
justly
requires
the
whole
of
our
spirit
soul
and
body
therefore
when
he
prohibits
us
from
committing
adultery
he
at
the
same
time
forbids
us
either
by
lasciviously
ornamenting
our
persons
or
by
obscene
gesticulations
or
by
impure
expressions
insidiously
to
attack
the
chastity
of
others
for
there
is
much
reason
in
the
address
of
archelaus
to
a
young
man
clothed
in
an
immoderately
effeminate
and
delicate
manner
that
it
was
immaterial
in
what
part
he
was
immodest
with
respect
to
god
who
abominates
all
contamination
in
whatever
part
it
may
discover
itself
either
of
soul
or
of
body
and
that
there
may
be
no
doubt
on
the
subject
let
us
remember
that
god
here
recommends
chastity
if
the
lord
requires
chastity
of
us
he
condemns
every
thing
contrary
to
it
wherefore
if
we
aspire
to
obedience
neither
let
our
mind
internally
burn
with
depraved
concupiscence
nor
let
our
eyes
wanton
into
corrupt
affections
nor
let
our
body
be
adorned
for
purposes
of
seduction
nor
let
our
tongue
with
impure
speeches
allure
our
mind
to
similar
thoughts
nor
let
us
inflame
ourselves
with
intemperance
for
all
these
vices
are
stains
by
which
the
purity
of
chastity
is
defiled
the
eighth
commandment
shalt
not
xlv
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
as
injustice
is
an
abomination
to
god
every
man
may
possess
what
belongs
to
him
the
sum
of
it
then
is
that
we
are
forbidden
to
covet
the
property
of
others
and
are
therefore
enjoined
faithfully
to
use
our
endeavours
to
preserve
to
every
man
what
justly
belongs
to
him
for
we
ought
to
consider
that
what
a
man
possesses
has
fallen
to
his
lot
not
by
a
fortuitous
contingency
but
by
the
distribution
of
the
supreme
lord
of
all
and
that
therefore
no
man
can
be
deprived
of
his
possessions
by
criminal
methods
without
an
injury
being
done
to
the
divine
dispenser
of
them
but
the
species
of
theft
are
numerous
one
consists
in
violence
when
the
property
of
any
person
is
plundered
by
force
and
predatory
license
another
consists
in
malicious
imposture
when
it
is
taken
away
in
a
fraudulent
manner
another
consists
in
more
secret
cunning
where
any
one
is
deprived
of
his
property
under
the
mask
of
justice
another
consists
in
flatteries
where
we
are
cheated
under
the
pretence
of
a
donation
but
not
to
dwell
too
long
on
the
recital
of
the
different
species
of
theft
let
us
remember
that
all
artifices
by
which
the
possessions
and
wealth
of
our
neighbours
are
transferred
to
us
whenever
they
deviate
from
sincere
love
into
a
desire
of
deceiving
or
doing
any
kind
of
injury
are
to
be
esteemed
acts
of
theft
this
is
the
only
view
in
which
god
considers
them
even
though
the
property
may
be
gained
by
a
suit
at
law
for
he
sees
the
tedious
manœuvres
with
which
the
designing
man
begins
to
decoy
his
more
simple
neighbour
till
at
length
he
entangles
him
in
his
snares
he
sees
the
cruel
and
inhuman
laws
by
which
the
more
powerful
man
oppresses
and
ruins
him
that
is
weaker
he
sees
the
baits
with
which
the
more
crafty
trap
the
imprudent
all
which
things
are
concealed
from
the
judgment
of
man
nor
ever
come
to
his
knowledge
and
this
kind
of
injury
relates
not
only
to
money
or
to
goods
or
to
lands
but
to
whatever
each
individual
is
justly
entitled
to
for
we
defraud
our
neighbours
of
their
property
if
we
deny
them
those
kind
offices
which
it
is
our
duty
to
perform
to
them
if
an
idle
agent
or
steward
devour
the
substance
of
his
master
and
be
inattentive
to
the
care
of
his
domestic
affairs
if
he
either
improperly
waste
or
squander
with
a
luxurious
profusion
the
property
intrusted
to
him
if
a
servant
deride
his
master
if
he
divulge
his
secrets
if
by
any
means
he
betray
either
his
life
or
his
property
and
if
on
the
other
hand
a
master
inhumanly
oppress
his
family
holds
him
guilty
of
theft
for
the
property
of
others
is
withheld
and
misapplied
by
him
who
does
not
perform
towards
them
those
offices
which
the
duty
of
his
situation
requires
of
him
xlvi
we
shall
rightly
obey
this
commandment
therefore
if
contented
with
our
own
lot
we
seek
no
gain
but
in
an
honest
and
lawful
way
if
we
neither
desire
to
enrich
ourselves
by
injustice
nor
attempt
to
ruin
the
fortune
of
our
neighbour
in
order
to
increase
our
own
if
we
do
not
labour
to
accumulate
wealth
by
cruelty
and
at
the
expense
of
the
blood
of
others
if
we
do
not
greedily
scrape
together
from
every
quarter
regardless
of
right
or
wrong
whatever
may
conduce
to
satiate
our
avarice
or
support
our
prodigality
on
the
contrary
it
should
be
our
constant
aim
as
far
as
possible
faithfully
to
assist
all
by
our
advice
and
our
property
in
preserving
what
belongs
to
them
but
if
we
are
concerned
with
perfidious
and
fallacious
men
let
us
be
prepared
rather
to
recede
a
little
from
our
just
right
than
to
contend
with
them
moreover
let
us
communicate
to
the
necessities
and
according
to
our
ability
alleviate
the
poverty
of
those
whom
we
perceive
to
be
pressed
by
any
embarrassment
of
their
circumstances
lastly
let
every
man
examine
what
obligations
his
duty
lays
him
under
to
others
and
let
him
faithfully
discharge
the
duties
which
he
owes
them
for
this
reason
the
people
should
honour
their
governors
patiently
submit
to
their
authority
obey
their
laws
and
mandates
and
resist
nothing
to
which
they
can
submit
consistently
with
the
divine
will
on
the
other
hand
let
governors
take
care
of
their
people
preserve
the
public
peace
protect
the
good
punish
the
wicked
and
administer
all
things
in
such
a
manner
as
becomes
those
who
must
render
an
account
of
their
office
to
god
the
supreme
judge
let
the
ministers
of
churches
faithfully
devote
themselves
to
the
ministry
of
the
word
and
let
them
never
adulterate
the
doctrine
of
salvation
but
deliver
it
pure
and
uncontaminated
to
the
people
of
god
let
them
teach
not
only
by
their
doctrine
but
by
the
example
of
their
lives
in
a
word
let
them
preside
as
good
shepherds
over
the
sheep
let
the
people
on
their
part
receive
them
as
the
messengers
and
apostles
of
god
render
to
them
that
honour
to
which
the
supreme
master
has
exalted
them
and
furnish
them
with
the
necessaries
of
life
let
parents
undertake
the
support
government
and
instruction
of
their
children
as
committed
by
god
to
their
care
nor
let
them
exasperate
their
minds
and
alienate
their
affections
from
them
by
cruelty
but
cherish
and
embrace
them
with
the
lenity
and
indulgence
becoming
their
character
and
that
obedience
is
due
to
them
from
their
children
has
been
before
observed
let
juniors
revere
old
age
since
the
lord
has
designed
that
age
to
be
honourable
let
old
men
by
their
prudence
and
superior
experience
guide
the
imbecility
of
youth
not
teasing
them
with
sharp
and
clamorous
invectives
but
tempering
severity
with
mildness
and
affability
let
servants
show
themselves
obedient
and
diligent
in
the
service
of
their
masters
and
that
not
only
in
appearance
but
from
the
heart
as
serving
god
himself
neither
let
masters
behave
morosely
and
perversely
to
their
servants
harassing
them
with
excessive
asperity
or
treating
them
with
contempt
but
rather
acknowledge
them
as
their
brethren
and
companions
in
the
service
of
the
heavenly
master
entitled
to
be
regarded
with
mutual
affection
and
to
receive
kind
treatment
in
this
manner
i
say
let
every
man
consider
what
duties
he
owes
to
his
neighbours
according
to
the
relations
he
sustains
and
those
duties
let
him
discharge
moreover
our
attention
should
always
be
directed
to
the
legislator
to
remind
us
that
this
law
is
ordained
for
our
hearts
as
much
as
for
our
hands
in
order
that
men
may
study
both
to
protect
the
property
and
to
promote
the
interests
of
others
the
ninth
commandment
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
xlvii
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
because
god
who
is
truth
itself
execrates
a
lie
we
ought
to
preserve
the
truth
without
the
least
disguise
the
sum
of
it
therefore
is
that
we
neither
violate
the
character
of
any
man
either
by
calumnies
or
by
false
accusations
nor
distress
him
in
his
property
by
falsehood
nor
injure
him
by
detraction
or
impertinence
this
prohibition
is
connected
with
an
injunction
to
do
all
the
service
we
can
to
every
man
by
affirming
the
truth
for
the
protection
of
his
reputation
and
his
property
the
lord
seems
to
have
intended
the
following
words
as
an
exposition
of
this
command
thou
shalt
not
raise
a
false
report
put
not
thine
hand
with
the
wicked
to
be
an
unrighteous
again
keep
thee
far
from
a
false
in
another
place
also
he
not
only
forbids
us
to
practise
backbiting
and
among
the
people
but
prohibits
every
man
from
deceiving
his
brother
for
he
cautions
us
against
both
in
distinct
commandments
indeed
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
as
in
the
preceding
precepts
he
has
prohibited
cruelty
impurity
and
avarice
so
in
this
he
forbids
falsehood
of
which
there
are
two
branches
as
we
have
before
observed
for
either
we
transgress
against
the
reputation
of
our
neighbours
by
malignity
and
perverse
detraction
or
by
falsehood
and
sometimes
by
obloquy
we
injure
their
interests
it
is
immaterial
whether
we
suppose
the
testimony
here
designed
to
be
solemn
and
judicial
or
a
common
one
which
is
delivered
in
private
conversations
for
we
must
always
recur
to
this
of
each
of
the
separate
kinds
of
vices
one
species
is
proposed
as
an
example
to
which
the
rest
may
be
referred
and
that
in
general
the
species
selected
is
that
in
which
the
turpitude
of
the
vice
is
most
conspicuous
it
is
proper
however
to
extend
it
more
generally
to
calumnies
and
detraction
by
which
our
neighbours
are
unjustly
harassed
because
falsehood
in
a
forensic
testimony
is
always
attended
with
perjury
but
perjury
being
a
profanation
and
violation
of
the
name
of
god
has
already
been
sufficiently
condemned
in
the
third
commandment
wherefore
the
legitimate
observance
of
this
precept
is
that
our
tongue
by
asserting
the
truth
ought
to
serve
both
the
reputation
and
the
profit
of
our
neighbours
the
equity
of
this
is
for
if
a
good
name
be
more
precious
than
any
treasures
whatever
a
man
sustains
as
great
an
injury
when
he
is
deprived
of
the
integrity
of
his
character
as
when
he
is
despoiled
of
his
wealth
and
in
plundering
his
substance
there
is
sometimes
as
much
effected
by
false
testimony
as
by
the
hands
of
violence
xlviii
nevertheless
it
is
wonderful
with
what
supine
security
this
precept
is
generally
transgressed
so
that
few
persons
can
be
found
who
are
not
notoriously
subject
to
this
malady
we
are
so
fascinated
with
the
malignant
pleasure
of
examining
and
detecting
the
faults
of
others
nor
should
we
suppose
it
to
be
a
sufficient
excuse
that
in
many
cases
we
can
not
be
charged
with
falsehood
for
he
who
forbids
the
character
of
our
brother
to
be
bespattered
with
falsehood
wills
also
that
as
far
as
the
truth
will
permit
it
be
preserved
immaculate
for
although
he
only
guards
it
against
falsehood
he
thereby
suggests
that
it
is
committed
to
his
charge
but
this
should
be
sufficient
to
induce
us
to
defend
the
fair
character
of
our
god
concerns
himself
in
its
protection
wherefore
detraction
is
without
doubt
universally
condemned
now
by
detraction
we
mean
not
reproof
which
is
given
from
a
motive
of
correction
not
accusation
or
judicial
denunciation
by
which
recompense
is
demanded
for
an
injury
not
public
reprehension
which
tends
to
strike
terror
into
other
offenders
not
a
discovery
to
them
whose
safety
depends
on
their
being
previously
warned
that
they
may
not
be
endangered
through
ignorance
but
odious
crimination
which
arises
from
malice
and
a
violent
propensity
to
detraction
this
commandment
also
extends
so
far
as
to
forbid
us
to
affect
a
pleasantry
tinctured
with
scurrilous
and
bitter
sarcasms
severely
lashing
the
faults
of
others
under
the
appearance
of
sport
which
is
the
practice
of
some
who
aim
at
the
praise
of
raillery
to
the
prejudice
of
the
modesty
and
feelings
of
others
for
such
wantonness
sometimes
fixes
a
lasting
stigma
on
the
characters
of
our
brethren
now
if
we
turn
our
eyes
to
the
legislator
whose
proper
right
it
is
to
rule
our
ears
and
our
minds
as
much
as
our
tongues
it
will
certainly
appear
that
an
avidity
of
hearing
detraction
and
an
unreasonable
propensity
to
unfavourable
opinions
respecting
others
are
equally
prohibited
for
it
would
be
ridiculous
for
any
one
to
suppose
that
god
hates
slander
in
the
tongue
and
does
not
reprobate
malice
in
the
heart
wherefore
if
we
possess
the
true
fear
and
love
of
god
let
us
make
it
our
study
that
as
far
as
is
practicable
and
expedient
and
consistent
with
charity
we
devote
neither
our
tongues
nor
our
ears
to
opprobrious
and
malicious
raillery
nor
inadvertently
attend
to
unfavourable
suspicions
but
that
putting
fair
constructions
on
every
man
s
words
and
actions
we
regulate
our
hearts
our
ears
and
our
tongues
with
a
view
to
preserve
the
reputation
of
all
around
us
the
tenth
commandment
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour
s
house
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbour
s
wife
nor
his
nor
his
nor
his
ox
nor
his
ass
nor
any
thing
that
is
thy
neighbour
xlix
the
end
of
this
precept
is
that
since
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
our
whole
soul
should
be
under
the
influence
of
love
every
desire
inconsistent
with
charity
ought
to
be
expelled
from
our
minds
the
sum
then
will
be
that
no
thought
should
obtrude
itself
upon
us
which
would
excite
in
our
minds
any
desire
that
is
noxious
and
tends
to
the
detriment
of
another
to
which
corresponds
the
affirmative
precept
that
all
our
conceptions
deliberations
resolutions
and
undertakings
ought
to
be
consistent
with
the
benefit
and
advantage
of
our
neighbours
but
here
we
meet
with
what
appears
to
be
a
great
and
perplexing
difficulty
for
if
our
previous
assertions
be
true
that
the
terms
and
comprehend
the
licentious
desire
and
the
injurious
and
criminal
intention
this
may
be
thought
to
have
superseded
the
necessity
of
a
separate
command
being
afterwards
introduced
forbidding
us
to
covet
the
possessions
of
others
but
we
shall
easily
solve
this
difficulty
by
a
distinction
between
intention
and
concupiscence
for
an
intention
as
we
have
before
observed
in
explaining
the
former
commandments
is
a
deliberate
consent
of
the
will
when
the
mind
has
been
enslaved
by
any
unlawful
desire
concupiscence
may
exist
without
such
deliberation
or
consent
when
the
mind
is
only
attracted
and
stimulated
by
vain
and
corrupt
objects
as
the
lord
therefore
has
hitherto
commanded
our
wills
efforts
and
actions
to
be
subject
to
the
law
of
love
so
now
he
directs
that
the
conceptions
of
our
minds
be
subject
to
the
same
regulation
lest
any
of
them
be
corrupt
and
perverted
and
give
our
hearts
an
improper
impulse
as
he
has
forbidden
our
minds
to
be
inclined
and
persuaded
to
anger
hatred
adultery
rapine
and
falsehood
so
now
he
prohibits
them
from
being
instigated
to
these
vices
nor
is
it
without
cause
that
he
requires
such
consummate
rectitude
for
who
can
deny
that
it
is
reasonable
for
all
the
powers
of
our
souls
to
be
under
the
influence
of
love
but
if
any
one
deviate
from
the
path
of
love
who
can
deny
that
that
soul
is
in
an
unhealthy
state
now
whence
is
it
that
your
mind
conceives
desires
prejudicial
to
your
neighbour
but
that
neglecting
his
interest
you
consult
nothing
but
your
own
for
if
your
heart
were
full
of
love
there
would
be
no
part
of
it
exposed
to
such
imaginations
it
must
therefore
be
destitute
of
love
so
far
as
it
is
the
seat
of
concupiscence
some
one
will
object
that
it
is
unreasonable
that
imaginations
which
without
reflection
flutter
about
in
the
mind
and
then
vanish
away
should
be
condemned
as
symptoms
of
concupiscence
which
has
its
seat
in
the
heart
i
reply
that
the
present
question
relates
to
that
kind
of
imaginations
which
when
they
are
presented
to
our
understandings
at
the
same
time
strike
our
hearts
and
inflame
them
with
cupidity
since
the
mind
never
entertains
a
wish
for
any
thing
after
which
the
heart
is
not
excited
to
pant
therefore
god
enjoins
a
wonderful
ardour
of
love
which
he
will
not
allow
to
be
interrupted
even
by
the
smallest
degree
of
concupiscence
he
requires
a
heart
admirably
well
regulated
which
he
permits
not
to
be
disturbed
with
the
least
emotion
contrary
to
the
law
of
love
do
not
imagine
that
this
doctrine
is
unsupported
by
any
great
authority
for
i
derived
the
first
idea
of
it
from
augustine
now
though
the
design
of
the
lord
was
to
prohibit
us
from
all
corrupt
desires
yet
he
has
exhibited
as
examples
those
objects
which
most
generally
deceive
us
with
a
fallacious
appearance
of
pleasure
that
he
might
not
leave
any
thing
to
concupiscence
after
having
driven
it
from
those
objects
towards
which
it
is
most
violently
inclined
behold
then
the
second
table
of
the
law
which
sufficiently
instructs
us
in
the
duties
we
owe
to
men
for
the
sake
of
god
on
regard
to
whom
the
whole
rule
of
love
depends
the
duties
taught
in
this
second
table
therefore
we
shall
inculcate
in
vain
unless
our
instruction
be
founded
on
the
fear
and
reverence
of
god
to
divide
the
prohibition
of
concupiscence
into
two
precepts
the
discerning
reader
without
any
comment
of
mine
will
pronounce
to
be
a
corrupt
and
violent
separation
of
what
is
but
one
nor
is
the
repetition
of
this
phrase
thou
shalt
not
covet
any
objection
against
us
because
having
mentioned
the
house
or
family
god
enumerates
the
different
parts
of
it
beginning
with
the
wife
hence
it
clearly
appears
that
it
ought
to
be
read
as
it
is
correctly
read
by
the
hebrews
in
one
continued
connection
and
in
short
that
god
commands
that
all
that
every
man
possesses
remain
safe
and
entire
not
only
from
any
actual
injury
or
fraudulent
intention
but
even
from
the
least
emotion
of
cupidity
that
can
solicit
our
hearts
li
but
what
is
the
tendency
of
the
whole
law
will
not
now
be
difficult
to
judge
it
is
to
a
perfection
of
righteousness
that
it
may
form
the
life
of
man
after
the
example
of
the
divine
purity
for
god
has
so
delineated
his
own
character
in
it
that
the
man
who
exemplifies
in
his
actions
the
precepts
it
contains
will
exhibit
in
his
life
as
it
were
an
image
of
god
wherefore
when
moses
would
recall
the
substance
of
it
to
the
remembrance
of
the
israelites
he
said
and
now
israel
what
doth
the
lord
thy
god
require
of
thee
but
to
fear
the
lord
thy
god
to
walk
in
all
his
ways
and
to
love
him
and
to
serve
the
lord
thy
god
with
all
thy
heart
and
with
all
thy
soul
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
nor
did
he
cease
to
reiterate
the
same
things
to
them
whenever
he
intended
to
point
out
the
end
of
the
law
the
tendency
of
the
doctrine
of
the
law
is
to
connect
man
with
his
god
and
as
moses
elsewhere
expresses
it
to
make
him
cleave
to
the
lord
in
sanctity
of
life
now
the
perfection
of
this
sanctity
consists
in
two
principal
points
already
that
we
love
the
lord
our
god
with
all
our
heart
and
with
all
our
soul
and
with
all
our
strength
and
with
all
our
mind
and
our
neighbour
as
and
the
first
is
that
our
souls
be
completely
filled
with
the
love
of
god
from
this
the
love
of
our
neighbour
will
naturally
follow
as
the
apostle
signifies
when
he
says
that
the
end
of
the
commandment
is
charity
out
of
a
pure
heart
and
of
a
good
conscience
and
of
faith
here
we
find
a
good
conscience
and
faith
unfeigned
that
is
in
a
word
true
piety
stated
to
be
the
grand
source
from
which
charity
is
derived
he
is
deceived
therefore
who
supposes
that
the
law
teaches
nothing
but
certain
rudiments
and
first
principles
of
righteousness
by
which
men
are
introduced
to
the
commencement
but
are
not
directed
to
the
true
goal
of
good
works
since
beyond
the
former
sentence
of
moses
and
the
latter
of
paul
nothing
further
can
be
wanted
to
the
highest
perfection
for
how
far
will
he
wish
to
proceed
who
will
not
be
content
with
this
instruction
by
which
man
is
directed
to
the
fear
of
god
to
the
spiritual
worship
of
him
to
the
observance
of
his
commands
to
persevering
rectitude
in
the
way
of
the
lord
to
purity
of
conscience
and
sincere
faith
and
love
hence
we
derive
a
confirmation
of
the
foregoing
exposition
of
the
law
which
traces
and
finds
in
its
precepts
all
the
duties
of
piety
and
love
for
they
who
attend
merely
to
dry
and
barren
elements
as
though
it
taught
them
but
half
of
the
divine
will
are
declared
by
the
apostle
to
have
no
knowledge
of
its
end
lii
but
because
christ
and
his
apostles
in
reciting
the
substance
of
the
law
sometimes
omit
the
first
table
many
persons
are
deceived
in
this
point
who
wish
to
extend
their
expressions
to
both
tables
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
christ
calls
judgment
mercy
and
faith
the
weightier
matters
of
the
by
the
word
faith
it
is
evident
to
me
that
he
intends
truth
or
fidelity
towards
men
some
however
in
order
to
extend
the
passage
to
the
whole
law
take
the
word
faith
to
mean
religion
towards
god
but
for
this
there
is
no
foundation
for
christ
is
treating
of
those
works
by
which
man
ought
to
prove
himself
to
be
righteous
if
we
attend
to
this
observation
we
shall
cease
also
to
wonder
why
in
another
place
to
the
inquiry
of
a
young
man
what
those
commandments
are
by
the
observance
of
which
we
enter
into
life
he
only
returns
the
following
answer
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
and
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
for
obedience
to
the
first
table
consisted
chiefly
either
in
the
disposition
of
the
heart
or
in
ceremonies
the
disposition
of
the
heart
was
not
visible
and
the
ceremonies
were
diligently
performed
by
hypocrites
but
the
works
of
charity
are
such
as
enable
us
to
give
a
certain
evidence
of
righteousness
but
the
same
occurs
in
the
prophets
so
frequently
that
it
must
be
familiar
to
the
reader
who
is
but
tolerably
conversant
with
them
for
in
almost
all
cases
when
they
exhort
to
repentance
they
omit
the
first
table
and
insist
on
faith
judgment
mercy
and
equity
nor
do
they
by
this
method
neglect
the
fear
of
god
but
require
substantial
proof
of
it
from
those
marks
it
is
well
known
that
when
they
treat
of
the
observation
of
the
law
they
generally
insist
on
the
second
table
because
it
is
in
it
that
the
love
of
righteousness
and
integrity
is
principally
discovered
it
is
unnecessary
to
quote
the
passages
as
every
person
will
of
himself
easily
remark
what
i
have
stated
liii
is
it
then
it
will
be
asked
of
more
importance
towards
the
attainment
of
righteousness
to
live
innocently
with
men
than
piously
towards
god
by
no
means
but
because
no
man
fulfils
all
the
duties
of
charity
unless
he
really
fear
god
we
derive
from
those
duties
a
proof
of
his
piety
besides
the
lord
well
knowing
that
he
can
receive
no
benefit
from
us
which
he
also
declares
by
the
psalmist
requires
not
our
services
for
himself
but
employs
us
in
good
works
towards
our
neighbour
it
is
not
without
reason
then
that
the
apostle
makes
all
the
perfection
of
the
saints
to
consist
in
love
which
in
another
place
he
very
justly
styles
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
adding
that
he
that
loveth
another
hath
fulfilled
the
again
that
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
even
in
this
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
for
he
teaches
nothing
different
from
what
is
taught
by
christ
himself
when
he
says
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
it
is
certain
that
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
faith
and
all
that
pertains
to
the
legitimate
worship
of
god
hold
the
principal
place
and
that
love
occupies
an
inferior
station
but
our
lord
intends
that
the
observance
of
justice
and
equity
among
men
is
only
prescribed
to
us
in
the
law
that
our
pious
fear
of
him
if
we
really
possess
any
may
be
proved
by
our
actions
liv
here
then
we
must
rest
that
our
life
will
then
be
governed
according
to
the
will
of
god
and
the
prescriptions
of
his
law
when
it
is
in
all
respects
most
beneficial
to
our
brethren
but
we
do
not
find
in
the
whole
law
one
syllable
that
lays
down
any
rule
for
a
man
respecting
those
things
which
he
should
practise
or
omit
for
his
carnal
convenience
and
surely
since
men
are
born
in
such
a
state
that
they
are
entirely
governed
by
an
immoderate
passion
which
how
great
soever
their
departure
from
the
truth
they
always
retain
was
no
need
of
a
law
which
would
inflame
that
love
already
of
itself
too
violent
whence
it
plainly
appears
that
the
observance
of
the
commandments
consists
not
in
the
love
of
ourselves
but
in
the
love
of
god
and
of
our
neighbour
that
his
is
the
best
and
most
holy
life
who
lives
as
little
as
possible
to
himself
and
that
no
man
leads
a
worse
or
more
iniquitous
life
than
he
who
lives
exclusively
to
himself
and
makes
his
own
interest
the
sole
object
of
his
thoughts
and
pursuits
moreover
the
lord
in
order
to
give
us
the
best
expression
of
the
strength
of
that
love
which
we
ought
to
exercise
towards
our
neighbours
has
regulated
it
by
the
standard
of
our
because
there
was
no
stronger
or
more
vehement
affection
and
the
force
of
the
expression
must
be
carefully
examined
for
he
does
not
according
to
the
foolish
dreams
of
some
sophists
concede
the
first
place
to
and
assign
the
second
to
the
love
of
our
neighbour
but
rather
transfers
to
others
that
affection
of
love
which
we
naturally
restrict
to
ourselves
whence
the
apostle
asserts
that
charity
seeketh
not
her
nor
is
their
argument
that
every
thing
regulated
by
any
standard
is
inferior
to
the
standard
by
which
it
is
regulated
worthy
of
the
least
attention
for
god
does
not
appoint
our
as
the
rule
to
which
our
love
to
others
should
be
subordinate
but
whereas
through
our
natural
depravity
our
love
used
to
terminate
in
ourselves
he
shows
that
it
ought
now
to
be
diffused
abroad
that
we
may
be
ready
to
do
any
service
to
our
neighbour
with
as
much
alacrity
ardour
and
solicitude
as
to
ourselves
lv
now
since
christ
has
demonstrated
in
the
parable
of
the
samaritan
that
the
word
neighbour
comprehends
every
man
even
the
greatest
stranger
we
have
no
reason
to
limit
the
commandment
of
love
to
our
own
relations
or
friends
i
do
not
deny
that
the
more
closely
any
person
is
united
to
us
the
greater
claim
he
has
to
the
assistance
of
our
kind
offices
for
the
condition
of
humanity
requires
that
men
should
perform
more
acts
of
kindness
to
each
other
in
proportion
to
the
closeness
of
the
bonds
by
which
they
are
connected
whether
of
relationship
or
acquaintance
or
vicinity
and
this
without
any
offence
to
god
by
whose
providence
we
are
constrained
to
it
but
i
assert
that
the
whole
human
race
without
any
exception
should
be
comprehended
in
the
same
affection
of
love
and
that
in
this
respect
there
is
no
difference
between
the
barbarian
and
the
grecian
the
worthy
and
unworthy
the
friend
and
the
foe
for
they
are
to
be
considered
in
god
and
not
in
themselves
and
whenever
we
deviate
from
this
view
of
the
subject
it
is
no
wonder
if
we
fall
into
many
errors
wherefore
if
we
wish
to
adhere
to
the
true
law
of
love
our
eyes
must
chiefly
be
directed
not
to
man
the
prospect
of
whom
would
impress
us
with
hatred
more
frequently
than
with
love
but
to
god
who
commands
that
our
love
to
him
be
diffused
among
all
mankind
so
that
this
must
always
be
a
fundamental
maxim
with
us
that
whatever
be
the
character
of
a
man
yet
we
ought
to
love
him
because
we
love
god
lvi
wherefore
the
schoolmen
have
discovered
either
their
ignorance
or
their
wickedness
in
a
most
pestilent
manner
when
treating
of
the
precepts
prohibiting
the
desire
of
revenge
and
enjoining
the
love
of
our
enemies
which
were
anciently
delivered
to
all
the
jews
and
afterwards
equally
to
all
christians
they
have
made
them
to
be
counsels
which
we
are
at
liberty
to
obey
or
not
to
obey
and
have
confined
the
necessary
observance
of
them
to
the
monks
who
on
account
of
this
very
circumstance
would
be
more
righteous
than
plain
christians
because
they
voluntarily
bound
themselves
to
observe
these
counsels
the
reason
which
they
assign
for
not
receiving
them
as
laws
is
that
they
appear
too
burdensome
and
grievous
especially
to
christians
who
are
under
the
law
of
grace
do
they
presume
in
this
manner
to
disannul
the
eternal
law
of
god
respecting
the
love
of
our
neighbour
is
such
a
distinction
to
be
found
in
any
page
of
the
law
on
the
contrary
does
it
not
abound
with
commandments
most
strictly
enjoining
the
love
of
our
enemies
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
injunction
to
feed
our
neighbour
when
he
is
hungry
to
direct
into
the
right
way
his
oxen
or
his
asses
when
they
are
going
astray
and
to
help
them
when
sinking
under
a
burden
shall
we
do
good
to
his
cattle
for
his
sake
and
feel
no
benevolence
to
his
person
what
is
not
the
word
of
the
lord
eternal
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
which
is
expressed
in
another
passage
still
more
explicitly
thou
shalt
not
avenge
nor
bear
any
grudge
against
the
children
of
thy
let
them
either
obliterate
these
passages
from
the
law
or
acknowledge
that
the
lord
was
a
legislator
and
no
longer
falsely
pretend
that
he
was
only
a
counsellor
lvii
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
following
expressions
which
they
have
presumed
to
abuse
by
the
absurdity
of
their
comment
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curse
you
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
which
is
in
here
who
would
not
argue
with
chrysostom
that
the
allegation
of
such
a
necessary
cause
clearly
proves
these
to
be
not
exhortations
but
commandments
what
have
we
left
us
after
being
expunged
from
the
number
of
the
children
of
god
but
according
to
them
the
monks
will
be
the
only
sons
of
the
heavenly
father
they
alone
will
venture
to
invoke
god
as
their
father
what
will
now
become
of
the
church
upon
the
same
principle
it
will
be
confined
to
heathen
and
publicans
for
christ
says
if
ye
love
them
which
love
you
what
reward
have
ye
do
not
even
the
publicans
the
same
shall
not
we
be
in
a
happy
situation
if
they
leave
us
the
title
of
christians
but
deprive
us
of
the
inheritance
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
argument
of
augustine
is
equally
strong
when
the
lord
says
he
prohibits
adultery
he
forbids
you
to
violate
the
wife
of
your
enemy
no
less
than
of
your
friend
when
he
prohibits
theft
he
permits
you
not
to
steal
from
any
one
whether
he
be
a
friend
or
an
enemy
now
paul
reduces
these
two
prohibitions
of
theft
and
adultery
to
the
rule
of
love
and
even
teaches
that
they
are
briefly
comprehended
in
this
saying
namely
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
either
then
paul
must
have
been
an
erroneous
expositor
of
the
law
or
it
necessarily
follows
from
this
that
we
are
commanded
to
love
not
only
our
friends
but
also
our
enemies
those
therefore
who
so
licentiously
shake
off
the
yoke
common
to
the
children
of
god
evidently
betray
themselves
to
be
the
sons
of
satan
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
have
discovered
greater
stupidity
or
impudence
in
the
publication
of
this
dogma
for
all
the
fathers
decidedly
pronounce
that
these
are
mere
precepts
that
no
doubt
was
entertained
on
the
subject
in
the
time
of
gregory
appears
from
his
positive
assertions
for
he
treats
them
as
precepts
as
though
it
had
never
been
controverted
and
how
foolishly
do
they
argue
they
would
be
a
burden
say
they
too
grievous
for
christians
as
though
truly
any
thing
could
be
conceived
more
difficult
than
to
love
god
with
all
our
heart
with
all
our
soul
and
with
all
our
strength
compared
with
this
law
every
thing
must
be
accounted
easy
whether
it
be
to
love
an
enemy
or
to
banish
from
the
mind
all
desire
of
revenge
to
our
imbecility
indeed
every
thing
is
arduous
and
difficult
even
the
smallest
point
in
the
law
it
is
the
lord
in
whom
we
find
strength
let
him
give
what
he
commands
and
let
him
command
what
he
pleases
the
being
christians
under
the
law
of
grace
consists
not
in
unbounded
license
uncontrolled
by
any
law
but
in
being
ingrafted
into
christ
by
whose
grace
they
are
delivered
from
the
curse
of
the
law
and
by
whose
spirit
they
have
the
law
inscribed
on
their
hearts
this
grace
paul
has
figuratively
denominated
a
law
in
allusion
to
the
law
of
god
to
which
he
was
comparing
and
contrasting
it
their
dispute
concerning
the
word
law
is
a
dispute
about
nothing
lviii
of
the
same
nature
is
what
they
have
called
venial
term
which
they
apply
to
secret
impiety
which
is
a
breach
of
the
first
table
and
to
the
direct
transgression
of
the
last
commandment
for
this
is
their
definition
that
it
is
evil
desire
without
any
deliberate
assent
and
without
any
long
continuance
in
the
now
i
assert
that
evil
desire
can
not
enter
the
heart
except
through
a
deficiency
of
those
things
which
the
law
requires
we
are
forbidden
to
have
any
strange
gods
when
the
mind
assaulted
by
mistrust
looks
around
to
some
other
quarter
when
it
is
stimulated
by
a
sudden
desire
of
transferring
its
happiness
from
god
to
some
other
being
whence
proceed
these
emotions
however
transient
but
from
the
existence
of
some
vacant
space
in
the
soul
to
receive
such
temptations
and
not
to
protract
this
argument
to
greater
length
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
with
all
our
heart
with
all
our
mind
and
with
all
our
soul
therefore
unless
all
the
powers
of
our
soul
be
intensely
engaged
in
the
love
of
god
we
have
already
departed
from
the
obedience
required
by
the
law
for
that
the
dominion
of
god
is
not
well
established
in
our
conscience
is
evident
from
the
enemies
that
there
rebel
against
his
government
and
interrupt
the
execution
of
his
commands
that
the
last
commandment
properly
belongs
to
this
point
has
been
already
demonstrated
have
we
felt
any
evil
desire
in
our
heart
we
are
already
guilty
of
concupiscence
and
are
become
at
once
transgressors
of
the
law
because
the
lord
forbids
us
not
only
to
plan
and
attempt
any
thing
that
would
prove
detrimental
to
another
but
even
to
be
stimulated
and
agitated
with
concupiscence
now
the
curse
of
god
always
rests
on
the
transgression
of
the
law
we
have
no
reason
therefore
to
exempt
even
the
most
trivial
emotions
of
concupiscence
from
the
sentence
of
death
in
determining
the
nature
of
different
sins
says
augustine
let
us
not
use
deceitful
balances
to
weigh
what
we
please
and
how
we
please
according
to
our
own
humour
saying
this
is
heavy
is
light
but
let
us
borrow
the
divine
balance
from
the
holy
scriptures
as
from
the
treasury
of
the
lord
and
therein
weigh
what
is
heavy
or
rather
let
us
weigh
nothing
ourselves
but
acknowledge
the
weights
already
determined
by
the
and
what
says
the
scripture
the
assertion
of
paul
that
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
sufficiently
demonstrates
this
groundless
distinction
to
have
been
unknown
to
him
as
we
have
already
too
strong
a
propensity
to
hypocrisy
this
opiate
ought
by
no
means
to
have
been
added
to
lull
our
consciences
into
greater
insensibility
lix
i
wish
these
persons
would
consider
the
meaning
of
this
declaration
of
christ
whosoever
shall
break
one
of
these
least
commandments
and
shall
teach
men
so
he
shall
be
called
the
least
in
the
kingdom
of
are
not
they
of
this
number
who
thus
presume
to
extenuate
the
transgression
of
the
law
as
though
it
were
not
worthy
of
death
but
they
ought
to
consider
not
merely
what
is
commanded
but
who
it
is
that
gives
the
commands
because
the
smallest
transgression
of
the
law
which
he
has
given
is
a
derogation
from
his
authority
is
the
violation
of
the
divine
majesty
in
any
case
a
trivial
thing
in
their
estimation
lastly
if
god
has
declared
his
will
in
the
law
whatever
is
contrary
to
the
law
displeases
him
will
they
pretend
that
the
wrath
of
god
is
so
debilitated
and
disarmed
that
the
punishment
of
death
can
not
immediately
follow
he
has
unequivocally
declared
if
they
could
induce
themselves
to
listen
to
his
voice
rather
than
obscure
the
plain
truth
with
their
frivolous
subtleties
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
and
which
i
have
before
cited
the
wages
of
sin
is
they
acknowledge
it
to
be
sin
because
it
is
impossible
to
deny
it
yet
they
contend
that
it
is
not
sin
but
as
they
have
hitherto
too
much
resigned
themselves
to
infatuation
they
should
at
length
learn
to
return
to
the
exercise
of
their
reason
if
they
persevere
in
their
dreams
we
will
take
our
leave
of
them
let
the
children
of
god
know
that
all
sin
is
because
it
is
a
rebellion
against
the
will
of
god
which
necessarily
provokes
his
wrath
because
it
is
a
transgression
of
the
law
against
which
the
divine
judgment
is
universally
denounced
and
that
the
offences
of
the
saints
are
not
of
their
own
nature
but
because
they
obtain
pardon
through
the
mercy
of
god
chapter
ix
christ
though
known
to
the
jews
under
the
law
yet
clearly
revealed
only
in
the
gospel
as
it
was
not
without
reason
or
without
effect
that
god
was
pleased
in
ancient
times
to
manifest
himself
as
a
father
by
means
of
expiations
and
sacrifices
and
that
he
consecrated
to
himself
a
chosen
people
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
known
even
then
in
the
same
image
in
which
he
now
appears
to
us
with
meridian
splendour
therefore
malachi
after
having
enjoined
the
jews
to
attend
to
the
law
of
moses
and
to
persevere
in
the
observance
of
it
because
after
his
death
there
was
to
be
an
interruption
of
the
prophetical
office
immediately
announces
that
the
sun
of
righteousness
shall
in
this
language
he
suggests
that
the
law
tended
to
excite
in
the
pious
an
expectation
of
the
messiah
that
was
to
come
and
that
at
his
advent
there
was
reason
to
hope
for
a
much
greater
degree
of
light
for
this
reason
peter
says
that
the
prophets
have
inquired
and
searched
diligently
concerning
the
salvation
which
is
now
manifested
in
the
gospel
and
that
it
was
revealed
to
them
that
not
unto
themselves
but
unto
us
they
did
minister
the
things
which
are
now
reported
unto
you
by
them
that
have
preached
the
gospel
unto
not
that
their
instructions
were
useless
to
the
ancient
people
or
unprofitable
to
themselves
but
because
they
did
not
enjoy
the
treasure
which
god
through
their
hands
has
transmitted
to
us
for
in
the
present
day
the
grace
which
was
the
subject
of
their
testimony
is
familiarly
exhibited
before
our
eyes
and
whereas
they
had
but
a
small
taste
we
have
offered
to
us
a
more
copious
fruition
of
it
therefore
christ
who
asserts
that
moses
wrote
of
him
nevertheless
extols
that
measure
of
grace
in
which
we
excel
the
jews
addressing
his
disciples
he
says
blessed
are
your
eyes
for
they
see
and
your
ears
for
they
for
i
tell
you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see
and
have
not
seen
them
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear
and
have
not
heard
this
is
no
small
recommendation
of
the
evangelical
revelation
that
god
has
preferred
us
to
those
holy
fathers
who
were
eminent
for
singular
piety
to
this
declaration
that
other
passage
is
not
at
all
repugnant
where
christ
says
abraham
saw
my
day
and
was
for
though
his
prospect
of
a
thing
so
very
remote
was
attended
with
much
obscurity
yet
there
was
nothing
wanting
to
the
certainty
of
a
well
founded
hope
and
hence
that
joy
which
accompanied
the
holy
patriarch
even
to
his
death
neither
does
this
assertion
of
john
the
baptist
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
the
only
begotten
son
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
he
hath
declared
him
exclude
the
pious
who
had
died
before
his
time
from
a
participation
of
the
understanding
and
light
which
shine
in
the
person
of
christ
but
comparing
their
condition
with
ours
it
teaches
us
that
we
have
a
clear
manifestation
of
those
mysteries
of
which
they
had
only
an
obscure
prospect
through
the
medium
of
shadows
as
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
more
copiously
and
excellently
shows
that
god
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
therefore
though
the
only
begotten
son
who
is
now
to
us
the
brightness
of
the
glory
and
the
express
image
of
the
person
of
god
the
father
was
formerly
known
to
the
jews
as
we
have
elsewhere
shown
by
a
quotation
from
paul
that
he
was
the
leader
of
their
ancient
deliverance
from
egypt
yet
this
also
is
a
truth
which
is
asserted
by
the
same
paul
in
another
place
that
god
who
commanded
the
light
to
shine
out
of
darkness
hath
shined
in
our
hearts
to
give
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
in
the
face
of
jesus
for
when
he
appeared
in
this
his
image
he
made
himself
visible
as
it
were
in
comparison
with
the
obscure
and
shadowy
representation
of
him
which
had
been
given
before
this
renders
the
ingratitude
and
obstinacy
of
those
who
shut
their
eyes
amid
this
meridian
blaze
so
much
the
more
vile
and
detestable
and
therefore
paul
says
that
satan
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
their
minds
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
should
shine
unto
ii
now
i
understand
the
gospel
to
be
a
clear
manifestation
of
the
mystery
of
christ
i
grant
indeed
since
paul
styles
the
gospel
doctrine
of
that
whatever
promises
we
find
in
the
law
concerning
the
gracious
remission
of
sins
by
which
god
reconciles
men
to
himself
are
accounted
parts
of
it
for
he
opposes
faith
to
those
terrors
which
torment
and
harass
the
conscience
if
salvation
is
to
be
sought
by
works
whence
it
follows
that
taking
the
word
in
a
large
sense
it
comprehends
all
those
testimonies
which
god
formerly
gave
to
the
fathers
of
his
mercy
and
paternal
favour
but
it
is
more
eminently
applicable
to
the
promulgation
of
the
grace
exhibited
in
christ
this
acceptation
is
not
only
sanctioned
by
common
use
but
supported
by
the
authority
of
christ
and
the
apostles
whence
it
is
properly
said
of
him
that
he
preached
the
gospel
of
the
and
mark
introduces
himself
with
this
preface
the
beginning
of
the
gospel
of
jesus
but
it
is
needless
to
collect
more
passages
to
prove
a
thing
sufficiently
known
christ
then
by
his
advent
hath
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
through
the
by
these
expressions
paul
means
not
that
the
fathers
were
immerged
in
the
shades
of
death
till
the
son
of
god
became
incarnate
but
claiming
for
the
gospel
this
honourable
prerogative
he
teaches
that
it
is
a
new
and
unusual
kind
of
legation
in
which
god
has
performed
those
things
that
he
had
promised
that
the
truth
of
the
promises
might
appear
in
the
person
of
his
son
for
though
the
faithful
have
always
experienced
the
truth
of
the
assertion
of
paul
that
all
the
promises
of
god
in
him
are
yea
and
in
him
amen
because
they
have
been
sealed
in
their
hearts
yet
since
he
has
completed
in
his
body
all
the
parts
of
our
salvation
the
lively
exhibition
of
those
things
has
justly
obtained
new
and
singular
praise
hence
this
declaration
of
christ
hereafter
ye
shall
see
heaven
open
and
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
upon
the
son
of
for
though
he
seems
to
allude
to
the
ladder
which
the
patriarch
jacob
saw
in
a
vision
yet
he
displays
the
superior
excellence
of
his
advent
by
this
he
has
opened
the
gate
of
heaven
to
give
us
free
admittance
into
it
iii
nevertheless
we
must
beware
of
the
diabolical
imagination
of
servetus
who
while
he
designs
to
extol
the
magnitude
of
the
grace
of
christ
or
at
least
professes
such
a
design
totally
abolishes
all
the
promises
as
though
they
were
terminated
together
with
the
law
he
pretends
that
by
faith
in
the
gospel
we
receive
the
completion
of
all
the
promises
as
though
there
were
no
distinction
between
us
and
christ
i
have
just
observed
that
christ
left
nothing
incomplete
of
all
that
was
essential
to
our
salvation
but
it
is
not
a
fair
inference
that
we
already
enjoy
the
benefits
procured
by
him
for
this
would
contradict
the
declaration
of
paul
that
hope
is
laid
up
for
i
grant
indeed
that
when
we
believe
in
christ
we
at
the
same
time
pass
from
death
to
life
but
we
should
also
remember
the
observation
of
john
that
though
we
are
now
the
sons
of
god
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
though
christ
therefore
offers
us
in
the
gospel
a
present
plenitude
of
spiritual
blessings
yet
the
fruition
of
them
is
concealed
under
the
custody
of
hope
till
we
are
divested
of
our
corruptible
body
and
transfigured
into
the
glory
of
him
who
has
gone
before
us
in
the
mean
time
the
holy
spirit
commands
us
to
rely
on
the
promises
and
his
authority
we
ought
to
consider
sufficient
to
silence
all
the
clamours
of
servetus
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
godliness
hath
promise
of
the
life
that
now
is
and
of
that
which
is
to
come
and
therefore
he
boasts
of
being
an
apostle
of
christ
according
to
the
promise
of
life
which
is
in
christ
in
another
place
he
apprizes
us
that
we
have
the
same
promises
which
were
given
to
the
saints
in
former
times
finally
he
represents
it
as
the
summit
of
felicity
that
we
are
sealed
with
the
holy
spirit
of
promise
nor
indeed
have
we
otherwise
any
enjoyment
of
christ
any
further
than
as
we
embrace
him
invested
with
his
promises
hence
it
is
that
he
dwells
in
our
hearts
and
yet
we
live
like
pilgrims
at
a
distance
from
him
because
we
walk
by
faith
and
not
by
nor
is
there
any
contrariety
in
these
two
positions
that
we
possess
in
christ
all
that
belongs
to
the
perfection
of
the
life
of
heaven
and
yet
that
faith
is
a
vision
of
invisible
blessings
only
there
is
a
difference
to
be
observed
in
the
nature
or
quality
of
the
promises
because
the
gospel
affords
a
clear
discovery
of
that
which
the
law
has
represented
in
shadows
and
types
iv
this
likewise
evinces
the
error
of
those
who
never
make
any
other
comparison
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
than
between
the
merit
of
works
and
the
gratuitous
imputation
of
righteousness
this
antithesis
i
grant
is
by
no
means
to
be
rejected
because
paul
by
the
word
frequently
intends
the
rule
of
a
righteous
life
in
which
god
requires
of
us
what
we
owe
to
him
affording
us
no
hope
of
life
unless
we
fulfil
every
part
of
it
and
on
the
contrary
annexing
a
curse
if
we
are
guilty
of
the
smallest
transgression
this
is
the
sense
in
which
he
uses
it
in
those
passages
where
he
argues
that
we
are
accepted
by
god
through
grace
and
are
accounted
righteous
through
his
pardon
of
our
sins
because
the
observance
of
the
law
to
which
the
reward
is
promised
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
man
paul
therefore
justly
represents
the
righteousness
of
the
law
and
that
of
the
gospel
as
opposed
to
each
other
but
the
gospel
has
not
succeeded
the
whole
law
so
as
to
introduce
a
different
way
of
salvation
but
rather
to
confirm
and
ratify
the
promises
of
the
law
and
to
connect
the
body
with
the
shadows
for
when
christ
says
that
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
john
he
does
not
abandon
the
fathers
to
the
curse
which
the
slaves
of
the
law
can
not
escape
he
rather
implies
that
they
were
only
initiated
in
the
rudiments
of
religion
so
that
they
remained
far
below
the
sublimity
of
the
evangelical
doctrine
wherefore
when
paul
calls
the
gospel
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth
he
afterwards
adds
that
it
is
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
but
at
the
end
of
the
same
epistle
although
he
asserts
that
the
preaching
of
jesus
christ
is
the
revelation
of
the
mystery
which
was
kept
secret
since
the
world
began
he
qualifies
this
sentiment
with
the
following
it
is
now
made
manifest
and
by
the
scriptures
of
the
prophets
made
known
to
all
hence
we
conclude
that
when
mention
is
made
of
the
whole
law
the
gospel
differs
from
it
only
with
respect
to
a
clear
manifestation
but
on
account
of
the
inestimable
plenitude
of
grace
which
has
been
displayed
to
us
in
christ
the
celestial
kingdom
of
god
is
justly
said
to
have
been
erected
in
the
earth
at
his
advent
now
john
was
placed
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
holding
an
intermediate
office
connected
with
both
for
though
in
calling
christ
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
victim
for
the
expiation
of
sins
he
preached
the
substance
of
the
gospel
yet
because
he
did
not
clearly
express
that
incomparable
power
and
glory
which
afterwards
appeared
in
his
resurrection
christ
affirms
that
he
is
not
equal
to
the
apostles
this
is
his
meaning
in
the
following
words
among
them
that
are
born
of
women
there
hath
not
risen
a
greater
than
john
the
baptist
notwithstanding
he
that
is
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
greater
than
for
he
is
not
there
commending
the
persons
of
men
but
after
having
preferred
john
to
all
the
prophets
he
allots
the
highest
degree
of
honour
to
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
which
we
have
elsewhere
seen
is
signified
by
the
kingdom
of
when
john
himself
said
that
he
was
only
a
voice
as
though
he
were
inferior
to
the
prophets
this
declaration
proceeded
not
from
a
pretended
humility
he
meant
to
signify
that
he
was
not
intrusted
with
a
proper
embassy
but
acted
merely
in
the
capacity
of
a
herald
according
to
the
prediction
of
malachi
behold
i
will
send
you
elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
nor
indeed
through
the
whole
course
of
his
ministry
did
he
aim
at
any
thing
but
procuring
disciples
for
christ
which
he
also
proves
from
isaiah
to
have
been
the
commission
given
him
by
god
in
this
sense
he
was
called
by
christ
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
because
the
full
day
had
not
yet
arrived
yet
this
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
numbered
among
the
preachers
of
the
gospel
as
he
used
the
same
baptism
which
was
afterwards
delivered
to
the
apostles
but
it
was
not
till
after
christ
was
received
into
the
celestial
glory
that
the
more
free
and
rapid
progress
of
the
apostles
completed
what
john
had
begun
chapter
x
the
similarity
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
from
the
preceding
observations
it
may
now
be
evident
that
all
those
persons
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
whom
god
has
adopted
into
the
society
of
his
people
have
been
federally
connected
with
him
by
the
same
law
and
the
same
doctrine
which
are
in
force
among
us
but
because
it
is
of
no
small
importance
that
this
point
be
established
i
shall
show
by
way
of
appendix
since
the
fathers
were
partakers
with
us
of
the
same
inheritance
and
hoped
for
the
same
salvation
through
the
grace
of
our
common
mediator
how
far
their
condition
in
this
connection
was
different
from
ours
for
though
the
testimonies
we
have
collected
from
the
law
and
the
prophets
in
proof
of
this
render
it
sufficiently
evident
that
the
people
of
god
have
never
had
any
other
rule
of
religion
and
piety
yet
because
some
writers
have
raised
many
disputes
concerning
the
difference
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
which
may
occasion
doubts
in
the
mind
of
an
undiscerning
reader
we
shall
assign
a
particular
chapter
for
the
better
and
more
accurate
discussion
of
this
subject
moreover
what
would
otherwise
have
been
very
useful
has
now
been
rendered
necessary
for
us
by
servetus
and
some
madmen
of
the
sect
of
the
anabaptists
who
entertain
no
other
ideas
of
the
israelitish
nation
than
of
a
herd
of
swine
whom
they
pretend
to
have
been
pampered
by
the
lord
in
this
world
without
the
least
hope
of
a
future
immortality
in
heaven
to
defend
the
pious
mind
therefore
from
this
pestilent
error
and
at
the
same
time
to
remove
all
difficulties
which
may
arise
from
the
mention
of
a
diversity
between
the
old
and
new
testaments
let
us
as
we
proceed
examine
what
similarity
there
is
between
them
and
what
difference
what
covenant
the
lord
made
with
the
israelites
in
ancient
times
before
the
advent
of
christ
and
what
he
has
entered
into
with
us
since
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
ii
and
indeed
both
these
topics
may
be
despatched
in
one
word
the
covenant
of
all
the
fathers
is
so
far
from
differing
substantially
from
ours
that
it
is
the
very
same
it
only
varies
in
the
administration
but
as
such
extreme
brevity
would
not
convey
to
any
man
a
clear
understanding
of
the
subject
it
is
necessary
if
we
would
do
any
good
to
proceed
to
a
more
diffuse
explication
of
it
but
in
showing
their
similarity
or
rather
unity
it
will
be
needless
to
recapitulate
all
the
particulars
which
have
already
been
mentioned
and
unseasonable
to
introduce
those
things
which
remain
to
be
discussed
in
some
other
place
we
must
here
insist
chiefly
on
three
principal
points
we
have
to
maintain
first
that
carnal
opulence
and
felicity
were
not
proposed
to
the
jews
as
the
mark
towards
which
they
should
ultimately
aspire
but
that
they
were
adopted
to
the
hope
of
immortality
and
that
the
truth
of
this
adoption
was
certified
to
them
by
oracles
by
the
law
and
by
the
prophets
secondly
that
the
covenant
by
which
they
were
united
to
the
lord
was
founded
not
on
any
merits
of
theirs
but
on
the
mere
mercy
of
god
who
called
them
thirdly
that
they
both
possessed
and
knew
christ
as
the
mediator
by
whom
they
were
united
to
god
and
became
partakers
of
his
promises
the
second
of
these
points
as
perhaps
it
is
not
yet
sufficiently
known
shall
be
demonstrated
at
large
in
its
proper
place
for
we
shall
prove
by
numerous
and
explicit
testimonies
of
the
prophets
that
whatever
blessing
the
lord
ever
gave
or
promised
to
his
people
proceeded
from
his
indulgent
goodness
the
third
point
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
in
several
places
and
we
have
not
wholly
neglected
the
first
iii
in
discussing
the
first
point
therefore
because
it
principally
belongs
to
the
present
argument
and
is
the
grand
subject
of
their
controversy
against
us
we
will
use
the
more
diligent
application
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
if
any
thing
be
wanting
to
the
explication
of
the
others
it
may
be
supplied
as
we
proceed
or
added
afterwards
in
a
suitable
place
indeed
the
apostle
removes
every
doubt
respecting
all
these
points
when
he
says
that
god
the
father
promised
afore
by
his
prophets
in
the
holy
scriptures
the
gospel
concerning
his
son
which
he
promulgated
in
the
appointed
time
and
again
that
the
righteousness
of
faith
which
is
revealed
in
the
gospel
is
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
for
the
gospel
does
not
detain
men
in
the
joy
of
the
present
life
but
elevates
them
to
the
hope
of
immortality
does
not
fasten
them
to
terrestrial
delights
but
announcing
to
them
a
hope
reserved
in
heaven
does
as
it
were
transport
them
thither
for
this
is
the
description
which
he
gives
in
another
place
in
whom
also
after
that
ye
believed
ye
were
sealed
with
that
holy
spirit
of
promise
which
is
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of
the
purchased
again
we
heard
of
your
faith
in
christ
jesus
and
of
the
love
which
ye
have
to
all
the
saints
for
the
hope
which
is
laid
up
for
you
in
heaven
whereof
ye
heard
before
in
the
word
of
the
truth
of
the
again
he
called
you
by
our
gospel
to
the
obtaining
of
the
glory
of
our
lord
jesus
whence
it
is
called
the
word
of
salvation
and
the
power
of
god
to
the
salvation
of
believers
and
the
kingdom
of
now
if
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
be
spiritual
and
open
a
way
to
the
possession
of
an
immortal
life
let
us
not
suppose
that
they
to
whom
it
was
promised
and
announced
were
totally
negligent
and
careless
of
their
souls
and
stupefied
in
the
pursuit
of
corporeal
pleasures
nor
let
any
one
here
cavil
that
the
promises
which
are
recorded
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
respecting
the
gospel
were
not
designed
for
the
jews
for
just
after
having
spoken
of
the
gospel
being
promised
in
the
law
he
adds
that
what
things
soever
the
law
saith
it
saith
to
them
who
are
under
the
this
was
in
another
argument
i
grant
but
when
he
said
that
whatever
the
law
inculcates
truly
belonged
to
the
jews
he
was
not
so
forgetful
as
not
to
remember
what
he
had
affirmed
a
few
verses
before
concerning
the
gospel
promised
in
the
law
by
declaring
that
the
old
testament
contained
evangelical
promises
therefore
the
apostle
most
clearly
demonstrates
that
it
principally
related
to
a
future
life
iv
for
the
same
reason
it
follows
that
it
was
founded
on
the
free
mercy
of
god
and
confirmed
by
the
mediation
of
christ
for
even
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
only
announces
that
sinners
are
justified
by
the
paternal
goodness
of
god
independently
of
any
merit
of
their
own
and
the
whole
substance
of
it
terminates
in
christ
who
then
dares
to
represent
the
jews
as
destitute
of
christ
with
whom
we
are
informed
the
evangelical
covenant
was
made
of
which
christ
is
the
sole
foundation
who
dares
to
represent
them
as
strangers
to
the
benefit
of
a
free
salvation
to
whom
we
are
informed
the
doctrine
of
the
righteousness
of
faith
was
communicated
but
not
to
be
prolix
in
disputing
on
a
clear
point
we
have
a
remarkable
expression
of
the
lord
abraham
rejoiced
to
see
my
day
and
he
saw
it
and
was
and
what
christ
there
declares
concerning
abraham
the
apostle
shows
to
have
been
universal
among
the
faithful
when
he
says
that
christ
remains
the
same
yesterday
and
and
for
for
he
there
speaks
not
only
of
the
eternal
divinity
of
christ
but
of
his
power
which
has
been
perpetually
manifested
to
the
faithful
wherefore
both
the
blessed
virgin
and
zachariah
declare
in
their
songs
that
the
salvation
revealed
in
christ
is
a
performance
of
the
promises
which
the
lord
had
made
to
abraham
and
the
patriarchs
if
the
lord
in
the
manifestation
of
christ
faithfully
performed
his
ancient
oath
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
end
of
the
old
testament
was
always
in
christ
and
eternal
life
moreover
the
apostle
makes
the
israelites
equal
to
us
not
only
in
the
grace
of
the
covenant
but
also
in
the
signification
of
the
sacraments
for
when
he
means
to
adduce
examples
of
the
punishments
with
which
the
scripture
states
them
to
have
been
formerly
chastised
in
order
to
deter
the
corinthians
from
running
into
similar
crimes
he
begins
by
premising
that
we
have
no
reason
to
arrogate
any
preëminence
to
ourselves
which
can
deliver
us
from
the
divine
vengeance
inflicted
on
them
since
the
lord
not
only
favoured
them
with
the
same
benefits
but
illustrated
his
grace
among
them
by
the
same
symbols
as
though
he
had
said
if
ye
confide
in
being
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
because
both
baptism
by
which
you
have
been
sealed
and
the
supper
which
you
daily
receive
have
excellent
promises
while
at
the
same
time
you
despise
the
divine
goodness
and
live
licentious
lives
ye
that
the
jews
also
were
not
destitute
of
such
symbols
though
the
lord
inflicted
on
them
his
severest
judgments
they
were
baptized
in
their
passage
through
the
sea
and
in
the
cloud
by
which
they
were
protected
from
the
fervour
of
the
sun
our
opponents
maintain
that
passage
to
have
been
a
carnal
baptism
corresponding
in
some
degree
to
our
spiritual
one
but
if
that
were
admitted
the
apostle
s
argument
would
not
proceed
for
his
design
here
is
to
prevent
christians
from
supposing
that
they
excel
the
jews
in
the
privilege
of
baptism
nor
is
what
immediately
follows
that
they
did
all
eat
the
same
spiritual
meat
and
did
all
drink
the
same
spiritual
drink
which
he
interprets
of
christ
liable
to
this
cavil
vi
to
invalidate
this
declaration
of
paul
they
object
the
assertion
of
christ
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
wilderness
and
are
dead
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
that
is
my
flesh
he
shall
live
for
but
the
two
passages
are
reconciled
without
any
difficulty
the
lord
because
he
was
addressing
auditors
who
only
sought
to
be
satisfied
with
corporeal
sustenance
but
were
unconcerned
about
food
for
the
soul
accommodates
his
discourse
in
some
measure
to
their
capacity
and
institutes
a
comparison
between
manna
and
his
own
body
particularly
to
strike
their
senses
they
demand
that
in
order
to
acquire
authority
to
himself
he
should
prove
his
power
by
some
miracle
such
as
moses
performed
in
the
desert
when
he
obtained
manna
from
heaven
in
the
manna
however
they
had
no
idea
of
any
thing
but
a
remedy
for
corporeal
hunger
with
which
the
people
were
then
afflicted
they
did
not
penetrate
to
that
sublimer
mystery
of
which
paul
treats
christ
therefore
to
demonstrate
the
superiority
of
the
blessing
they
ought
to
expect
from
him
to
that
which
they
said
their
fathers
had
received
from
moses
makes
this
comparison
if
it
be
in
your
opinion
a
great
and
memorable
miracle
that
the
lord
to
prevent
his
people
from
perishing
in
the
wilderness
supplied
them
by
means
of
moses
with
heavenly
food
which
served
them
as
a
temporary
sustenance
conclude
how
much
more
excellent
that
food
must
be
which
communicates
immortality
we
see
then
why
the
lord
omitted
the
principal
thing
designed
by
the
manna
and
only
remarked
the
lowest
advantage
that
resulted
from
it
it
was
because
the
jews
as
if
with
an
intention
of
reproaching
him
contrasted
him
with
moses
who
had
supplied
the
necessities
of
the
people
with
manna
he
replies
that
he
is
the
dispenser
of
a
far
superior
favour
in
comparison
with
which
the
corporeal
sustenance
of
the
people
the
sole
object
of
their
great
admiration
deserves
to
be
considered
as
nothing
knowing
that
the
lord
when
he
rained
manna
from
heaven
not
only
poured
it
down
for
the
support
of
their
bodies
but
likewise
dispersed
it
as
a
spiritual
mystery
to
typify
that
spiritual
vivification
which
is
experienced
in
christ
paul
does
not
neglect
that
view
of
the
subject
which
is
most
deserving
of
consideration
wherefore
it
is
certainly
and
clearly
proved
that
the
same
promises
of
an
eternal
and
heavenly
life
with
which
the
lord
now
favours
us
were
not
only
communicated
to
the
jews
but
even
sealed
and
confirmed
by
sacraments
truly
spiritual
this
subject
is
argued
at
length
by
augustine
against
faustus
the
manichæan
vii
but
if
the
reader
would
prefer
a
recital
of
testimonies
from
the
law
and
the
prophets
to
show
him
that
the
spiritual
covenant
was
common
also
to
the
fathers
as
we
have
heard
from
christ
and
his
apostles
will
attend
to
this
wish
and
that
with
the
greater
readiness
because
our
adversaries
will
thereby
be
more
decisively
confuted
and
will
have
no
pretence
for
any
future
cavil
i
will
begin
with
that
demonstration
which
though
i
know
the
anabaptists
will
superciliously
deem
it
futile
and
almost
ridiculous
yet
will
have
considerable
weight
with
persons
of
docility
and
good
understanding
and
i
take
it
for
granted
that
there
is
such
a
vital
efficacy
in
the
divine
word
as
to
quicken
the
souls
of
all
those
whom
god
favours
with
a
participation
of
it
for
the
assertion
of
peter
has
ever
been
true
that
it
is
an
incorruptible
seed
which
abideth
for
ever
as
he
also
concludes
from
the
words
of
isaiah
now
when
god
anciently
united
the
jews
with
himself
in
this
sacred
bond
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
separated
them
to
the
hope
of
eternal
life
for
when
i
say
that
they
embraced
the
word
which
was
to
connect
them
more
closely
with
god
i
advert
not
to
that
general
species
of
communication
with
him
which
is
diffused
through
heaven
and
earth
and
all
the
creatures
in
the
universe
which
although
it
animates
all
things
according
to
their
respective
natures
yet
does
not
deliver
from
the
necessity
of
corruption
i
refer
to
that
particular
species
of
communication
by
which
the
minds
of
the
pious
are
enlightened
into
the
knowledge
of
god
and
in
some
measure
united
to
him
since
adam
abel
noah
abraham
and
the
other
patriarchs
were
attached
to
god
by
such
an
illumination
of
his
word
i
maintain
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
had
an
entrance
into
his
immortal
kingdom
for
it
was
a
real
participation
of
god
which
can
not
be
separated
from
the
blessing
of
eternal
life
viii
if
the
subject
still
appear
involved
in
any
obscurity
let
us
proceed
to
the
very
form
of
the
covenant
which
will
not
only
satisfy
sober
minds
but
will
abundantly
prove
the
ignorance
of
those
who
endeavour
to
oppose
it
for
the
lord
has
always
made
this
covenant
with
his
servants
i
will
be
your
god
and
ye
shall
be
my
these
expressions
according
to
the
common
explanation
of
the
prophets
comprehend
life
and
salvation
and
consummate
felicity
for
it
is
not
without
reason
that
david
frequently
pronounces
how
blessed
is
the
nation
whose
god
is
the
lord
and
the
people
whom
he
hath
chosen
for
his
own
inheritance
and
that
not
on
account
of
any
earthly
felicity
but
because
he
delivers
from
death
perpetually
preserves
and
attends
with
everlasting
mercy
those
whom
he
has
taken
for
his
people
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
other
prophets
art
thou
not
from
everlasting
o
lord
my
god
mine
holy
one
we
shall
not
the
lord
is
our
lawgiver
the
lord
is
our
king
he
will
save
happy
art
thou
o
israel
who
is
like
unto
thee
o
people
saved
by
the
lord
but
not
to
labour
much
on
a
point
which
does
not
require
it
we
are
frequently
reminded
in
reading
the
prophets
that
we
shall
have
a
plenitude
of
all
blessings
and
even
a
certainty
of
salvation
provided
the
lord
be
our
god
and
that
on
good
ground
for
if
his
face
as
soon
as
it
has
begun
to
shine
be
a
present
pledge
of
salvation
will
god
manifest
himself
to
any
man
without
opening
the
treasures
of
salvation
to
him
for
god
is
our
god
on
the
express
condition
of
his
walking
in
the
midst
of
us
as
he
declared
by
moses
but
this
presence
of
his
can
not
be
obtained
without
the
possession
of
life
and
though
nothing
further
had
been
expressed
they
had
a
promise
of
spiritual
life
sufficiently
clear
in
these
words
i
am
the
lord
your
for
he
announced
that
he
would
be
a
god
not
only
to
their
bodies
but
chiefly
to
their
souls
for
the
soul
unless
united
to
god
by
righteousness
remains
alienated
from
him
at
death
but
let
that
union
take
place
and
it
will
be
attended
with
eternal
salvation
ix
moreover
he
not
only
declared
himself
to
be
their
god
but
promised
to
continue
so
for
ever
in
order
that
their
hope
not
contented
with
present
blessings
might
be
extended
to
eternity
and
that
the
use
of
the
future
tense
conveyed
this
idea
to
them
appears
from
many
expressions
where
the
faithful
console
themselves
not
only
amidst
present
evils
but
for
futurity
that
god
will
never
desert
them
but
in
regard
to
the
second
part
of
the
promise
he
still
more
plainly
encouraged
them
concerning
the
extension
of
the
divine
blessing
to
them
beyond
the
limits
of
the
present
life
i
will
be
a
god
to
thy
seed
after
for
if
he
intended
to
declare
his
benevolence
to
them
after
they
were
dead
by
blessing
their
posterity
much
more
would
he
not
fail
of
manifesting
his
favour
towards
themselves
for
god
is
not
like
men
who
transfer
their
love
to
the
children
of
their
friends
because
death
takes
away
their
opportunity
of
performing
kind
offices
to
those
who
were
objects
of
their
regard
but
god
whose
beneficence
is
not
interrupted
by
death
deprives
not
the
dead
of
the
blessings
of
his
mercy
which
for
their
sakes
he
diffuses
through
a
thousand
generations
the
design
of
the
lord
therefore
was
to
show
them
by
a
clear
proof
the
magnitude
and
abundance
of
his
goodness
which
they
should
experience
after
death
when
he
described
its
exuberance
as
reaching
to
all
their
posterity
now
the
lord
sealed
the
truth
and
as
it
were
exhibited
the
completion
of
this
promise
when
he
called
himself
the
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
long
after
they
were
dead
for
what
is
implied
in
it
would
it
not
have
been
a
ridiculous
appellation
if
they
had
perished
it
would
have
been
just
as
if
he
had
said
i
am
the
god
of
those
who
have
no
existence
wherefore
the
evangelists
relate
that
with
this
single
argument
the
sadducees
were
so
embarrassed
by
christ
as
to
be
unable
to
deny
that
moses
had
given
a
testimony
in
favour
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
for
they
had
learned
from
moses
himself
that
all
his
saints
are
in
his
whence
it
was
easy
to
infer
that
death
had
not
annihilated
those
whom
he
who
is
the
arbiter
of
life
and
death
had
received
into
his
guardianship
and
protection
x
now
to
come
to
the
principal
point
on
which
this
controversy
turns
let
us
examine
whether
the
faithful
themselves
were
not
so
instructed
by
the
lord
as
to
be
sensible
that
they
had
a
better
life
in
another
world
and
to
meditate
on
that
to
the
neglect
of
the
present
in
the
first
place
the
course
of
life
which
was
divinely
enjoined
them
was
a
perpetual
exercise
by
which
they
were
reminded
that
they
were
the
most
miserable
of
all
mankind
if
they
had
no
happiness
but
in
the
present
life
adam
rendered
most
unhappy
by
the
mere
remembrance
of
his
lost
felicity
finds
great
difficulty
in
supplying
his
wants
by
anxious
toils
nor
does
the
divine
malediction
confine
itself
to
his
manual
labours
he
experiences
the
bitterest
sorrow
from
that
which
was
his
only
remaining
consolation
of
his
two
sons
he
is
deprived
of
one
by
the
parricidal
hands
of
his
brother
the
survivor
is
deservedly
the
object
of
his
detestation
and
abhorrence
abel
cruelly
assassinated
in
the
flower
of
his
age
exhibits
an
example
of
human
calamity
noah
while
the
whole
world
securely
abandons
itself
to
sensual
delights
consumes
a
valuable
part
of
his
life
with
excessive
fatigue
in
building
the
ark
his
escape
from
death
was
attended
with
greater
distress
than
if
he
had
died
a
hundred
times
for
besides
that
the
ark
was
as
it
were
a
sepulchre
to
him
for
ten
months
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
than
to
be
detained
for
so
long
a
period
almost
immersed
in
the
ordure
of
animals
after
having
escaped
from
such
great
difficulties
he
meets
with
a
fresh
occasion
of
grief
he
sees
himself
ridiculed
by
his
own
son
and
is
constrained
to
pronounce
a
curse
with
his
own
mouth
upon
him
whom
by
the
great
goodness
of
god
he
had
received
safe
from
the
deluge
xi
abraham
is
one
who
ought
to
be
deemed
equal
to
a
host
if
we
consider
his
faith
which
is
proposed
to
us
as
the
best
standard
of
believing
so
that
we
must
be
numbered
in
his
family
in
order
to
be
the
children
of
god
now
what
would
be
more
absurd
than
that
abraham
should
be
the
father
of
all
the
faithful
and
not
possess
even
the
lowest
place
among
them
but
he
can
not
be
excluded
from
the
number
nor
even
from
the
most
honourable
station
without
the
destruction
of
the
whole
church
now
with
respect
to
the
circumstances
of
his
life
he
is
first
called
he
is
torn
by
the
divine
command
from
his
country
his
parents
and
his
friends
the
enjoyment
of
whom
is
supposed
to
give
life
its
principal
relish
as
though
god
positively
intended
to
deprive
him
of
all
the
pleasures
of
life
as
soon
as
he
has
entered
the
land
in
which
he
is
commanded
to
reside
he
is
driven
from
it
by
a
famine
he
removes
in
search
of
relief
to
a
place
where
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
safety
he
finds
it
necessary
to
disown
his
wife
which
would
probably
be
more
afflictive
to
him
than
many
deaths
after
having
returned
to
the
country
of
his
residence
he
is
again
expelled
from
it
by
famine
what
kind
of
felicity
is
it
to
dwell
in
such
a
country
where
he
must
so
frequently
experience
hunger
and
even
perish
for
want
of
sustenance
unless
he
leaves
it
in
the
country
of
abimelech
he
is
again
driven
to
the
same
necessity
of
purchasing
his
own
personal
safety
with
the
loss
of
his
wife
while
he
wanders
hither
and
thither
for
many
years
in
an
unsettled
state
he
is
compelled
by
the
continual
quarrels
of
his
servants
to
send
away
his
nephew
whom
he
regarded
as
a
son
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
bore
this
separation
just
as
he
would
the
amputation
of
one
of
his
limbs
soon
after
he
is
informed
that
enemies
have
carried
him
away
captive
whithersoever
he
directs
his
course
he
finds
himself
surrounded
by
savage
barbarians
who
will
not
even
permit
him
to
drink
the
water
of
wells
which
with
immense
labour
he
has
himself
digged
for
he
could
not
have
bought
the
use
of
them
from
the
king
of
gerar
if
it
had
not
been
previously
prohibited
when
he
arrives
to
old
age
beyond
the
time
of
having
children
he
experiences
the
most
disagreeable
and
painful
circumstance
with
which
that
age
is
attended
he
sees
himself
destitute
of
posterity
till
beyond
all
expectation
he
begets
ishmael
whose
birth
he
purchases
at
a
dear
rate
while
he
is
wearied
with
the
reproaches
of
sarah
just
as
if
he
encouraged
the
contumacy
of
his
and
so
were
himself
the
cause
of
the
domestic
disturbance
at
length
isaac
is
born
but
his
birth
is
attended
with
this
condition
that
ishmael
the
must
be
banished
from
the
family
and
abandoned
like
an
enemy
when
isaac
is
left
alone
to
solace
the
good
man
in
his
declining
years
he
is
soon
after
commanded
to
sacrifice
him
what
can
the
human
mind
imagine
more
calamitous
than
for
a
father
to
become
the
executioner
of
his
own
son
if
he
had
been
taken
away
by
sickness
every
one
would
have
thought
the
aged
parent
unhappy
in
the
extreme
as
having
had
a
son
given
him
in
mockery
at
the
loss
of
whom
his
former
grief
on
account
of
his
being
destitute
of
children
would
certainly
be
redoubled
if
he
had
been
massacred
by
some
stranger
the
calamity
would
have
been
greatly
increased
by
the
horrible
nature
of
his
end
but
to
be
slain
by
his
father
s
own
hand
exceeds
all
the
other
instances
of
distress
in
short
through
the
whole
course
of
his
life
abraham
was
so
driven
about
and
afflicted
that
if
any
one
wished
to
give
an
example
of
a
life
full
of
calamity
he
could
not
find
one
more
suitable
nor
let
it
be
objected
that
he
was
not
entirely
miserable
because
he
had
at
length
a
prosperous
deliverance
from
such
numerous
and
extreme
dangers
for
we
can
not
pronounce
his
to
be
a
happy
life
who
for
a
long
period
struggles
through
an
infinity
of
difficulties
but
his
who
is
exempted
from
afflictions
and
favoured
with
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
present
blessings
xii
isaac
though
afflicted
with
fewer
calamities
yet
scarcely
ever
enjoys
the
smallest
taste
of
pleasure
he
also
experiences
those
vexations
which
permit
not
a
man
to
be
happy
in
the
world
famine
drives
him
from

land
of

his

torn
from

bosom
his
neighbours
frequently
harass
him

take
every
method
of
distressing
him

that

contend
with

about
water
in

suffers

uneasiness
from

he
is
distressed
by

remedy
that
great
evil
but
by
the
exile
of
him
to
whom
he
had
given
the
blessing
with
respect
to
jacob
he
is
an
eminent
example
of
nothing
but
extreme
infelicity
he
passes
his
childhood
at
home
amidst
the
menaces
and
terrors
of
his
elder
brother
to
which
he
is
at
length
constrained
to
give
way
a
fugitive
from
his
parents
and
his
native
soil
in
addition
to
the
bitterness
of
exile
he
is
treated
with
unkindness
by
his
uncle
laban
it
is
not
sufficient
for
him
to
endure
a
most
hard
and
severe
servitude
of
seven
years
but
he
is
fraudulently
deceived
in
a
wife
for
the
sake
of
another
wife
he
must
enter
on
a
new
servitude
in
which
as
he
himself
complains
he
is
scorched
all
the
day
by
the
fervid
rays
of
the
sun
and
through
the
wakeful
night
benumbed
by
the
icy
cold
during
twenty
years
which
he
spends
in
such
extreme
hardships
he
is
daily
afflicted
with
fresh
injuries
from
his
nor
does
he
enjoy
tranquillity
in
his
own
family
which
he
sees
distracted
and
almost
torn
asunder
by
the
animosities
contentions
and
rivalship
of
his
wives
when
he
is
commanded
to
return
to
his
own
country
he
is
obliged
to
depart
in
a
manner
resembling
an
ignominious
flight
nor
even
then
can
he
escape
the
iniquity
of
his
but
is
harassed
with
his
reproaches
and
insults
in
the
midst
of
his
journey
immediately
after
he
falls
into
a
much
greater
difficulty
for
as
he
advances
towards
his
brother
he
has
death
before
his
eyes
in
as
many
forms
as
a
cruel
and
inveterate
enemy
can
possibly
contrive
he
is
exceedingly
tormented
and
distracted
with
dreadful
terrors
while
he
is
expecting
the
approach
of
his
brother
when
he
sees
him
he
falls
at
his
feet
like
a
person
half
dead
till
he
finds
him
more
reconciled
than
he
could
have
ventured
to
hope
moreover
on
his
first
entrance
into
the
land
he
is
deprived
of
rachel
his
dearly
beloved
wife
afterwards
he
hears
that
the
son
whom
he
had
by
her
and
whom
therefore
he
loved
above
the
rest
is
torn
asunder
by
wild
beasts
the
severity
of
his
grief
on
account
of
his
death
is
expressed
by
himself
when
after
many
days
of
mourning
he
obstinately
refuses
all
consolation
saying
i
will
go
down
into
the
grave
unto
my
son
in
the
mean
time
the
rape
and
violation
of
his
daughter
and
the
rashness
of
his
sons
in
revenging
it
which
not
only
made
him
an
object
of
abhorrence
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
but
put
him
in
immediate
danger
of
being
massacred
what
abundant
sources
were
these
of
anxiety
grief
and
vexation
then
follows
the
horrible
crime
of
reuben
his
than
which
no
greater
affliction
could
befall
him
for
if
the
pollution
of
a
man
s
wife
be
numbered
among
the
greatest
miseries
what
shall
we
say
of
it
when
the
crime
is
perpetrated
by
his
own
son
not
long
after
his
family
is
contaminated
with
incest
so
that
such
a
number
of
disgraceful
occurrences
may
be
expected
to
break
a
heart
otherwise
very
firm
and
unbroken
by
calamities
towards
the
end
of
life
when
he
is
seeking
sustenance
for
himself
and
family
in
a
season
of
famine
his
ears
are
wounded
by
the
report
of
a
new
calamity
which
informs
him
that
one
of
his
sons
is
detained
in
prison
and
in
order
to
recover
him
he
is
obliged
to
intrust
his
darling
benjamin
to
the
care
of
the
rest
who
can
suppose
that
in
such
an
accumulation
of
distresses
he
had
a
single
moment
of
respite
he
himself
who
is
best
able
to
give
a
testimony
respecting
himself
declares
to
pharaoh
that
his
days
on
the
earth
have
been
few
and
evil
by
affirming
that
he
has
lived
in
continual
miseries
he
denies
that
he
has
enjoyed
that
prosperity
which
the
lord
had
promised
him
therefore
either
jacob
formed
an
improper
and
ungrateful
estimate
of
the
favour
of
god
or
he
spake
the
truth
in
asserting
that
he
had
been
miserable
on
the
earth
if
his
affirmation
was
true
it
follows
that
his
hope
was
not
fixed
on
terrestrial
things
xiii
if
these
holy
fathers
expected
as
undoubtedly
they
did
expect
a
life
of
happiness
from
the
hand
of
god
they
both
knew
and
contemplated
a
different
kind
of
blessedness
from
that
of
this
terrestrial
life
this
the
apostle
very
beautifully
shows
when
he
says
by
faith
abraham
sojourned
in
the
land
of
promise
as
in
a
strange
country
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
isaac
and
jacob
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
these
all
died
in
faith
not
having
received
the
promises
but
having
seen
them
afar
off
and
were
persuaded
of
them
and
embraced
them
and
confessed
that
they
were
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth
for
they
that
say
such
things
declare
plainly
that
they
seek
a
country
and
truly
if
they
had
been
mindful
of
that
country
from
whence
they
came
out
they
might
have
had
opportunity
to
have
returned
but
now
they
desire
a
better
country
that
is
a
heavenly
wherefore
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
god
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
for
they
would
have
been
stupid
beyond
all
comparison
so
steadily
to
follow
promises
of
which
there
appeared
no
hope
on
earth
unless
they
had
expected
the
completion
of
them
in
another
world
but
the
apostle
with
great
force
principally
insists
on
they
called
the
present
life
a
as
is
also
stated
by
moses
for
if
they
were
strangers
and
sojourners
in
the
land
of
canaan
what
became
of
the
divine
promise
by
which
they
had
been
appointed
heirs
of
it
this
manifestly
implies
therefore
that
the
promise
which
the
lord
had
given
them
concerning
the
possession
of
it
related
to
something
more
remote
wherefore
they
never
acquired
a
foot
of
land
in
canaan
except
for
a
sepulchre
by
which
they
testified
that
they
had
no
hope
of
enjoying
the
benefit
of
the
promise
till
after
death
and
this
is
the
reason
why
jacob
thought
it
so
exceedingly
desirable
to
be
buried
there
that
he
made
his
son
joseph
promise
it
to
him
by
oath
and
why
joseph
commanded
that
his
bones
should
be
removed
thither
even
several
ages
after
his
death
when
they
would
have
been
long
reduced
to
ashes
xiv
in
short
it
evidently
appears
that
in
all
the
pursuits
of
life
they
kept
in
view
the
blessedness
of
the
future
state
for
why
should
jacob
have
so
eagerly
desired
and
exposed
himself
to
such
danger
in
endeavouring
to
obtain
the
primogeniture
which
would
occasion
his
exile
and
almost
his
rejection
from
his
family
but
from
which
he
could
derive
no
possible
benefit
unless
he
had
his
views
fixed
on
a
nobler
blessing
and
that
such
was
his
view
he
declared
in
these
words
which
he
uttered
with
his
expiring
breath
i
have
waited
for
thy
salvation
o
what
salvation
could
he
expect
when
he
felt
himself
about
to
expire
unless
he
had
seen
in
death
the
commencement
of
a
new
life
but
why
do
we
argue
concerning
the
saints
and
children
of
god
when
even
one
who
in
other
respects
endeavoured
to
oppose
the
truth
was
not
entirely
destitute
of
such
a
knowledge
for
what
was
the
meaning
of
balaam
when
he
said
let
me
die
the
death
of
the
righteous
and
let
my
last
end
be
like
his
but
the
same
which
david
afterwards
expressed
in
the
following
words
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
evil
shall
slay
the
if
death
were
the
ultimate
bound
of
human
existence
no
difference
could
be
observed
in
it
between
the
righteous
and
the
impious
the
distinction
between
them
consists
in
the
different
destinies
which
await
them
after
death
xv
we
have
not
yet
proceeded
beyond
moses
whose
only
office
our
opponents
allege
was
to
persuade
a
carnal
people
to
the
worship
of
god
by
the
fertility
of
the
land
and
an
abundance
of
all
things
and
yet
unless
any
one
wilfully
rejects
the
evidence
presented
to
him
we
already
discover
a
clear
declaration
of
a
spiritual
covenant
but
if
we
come
down
to
the
prophets
there
we
have
the
fullest
revelation
both
of
eternal
life
and
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
and
first
with
what
perspicuity
and
certainty
does
david
direct
all
his
writings
to
this
end
though
as
he
was
prior
to
the
rest
in
point
of
time
so
according
to
the
order
of
the
divine
dispensation
he
shadowed
forth
the
heavenly
mysteries
more
obscurely
than
they
did
what
estimate
he
formed
of
his
terrestrial
habitation
the
following
passage
declares
i
am
a
stranger
with
thee
and
a
sojourner
as
all
my
fathers
were
verily
every
man
at
his
best
estate
is
altogether
vanity
surely
every
man
walketh
in
a
vain
show
and
now
lord
what
wait
i
for
my
hope
is
in
he
who
after
having
confessed
that
there
is
nothing
substantial
or
permanent
on
earth
still
retains
the
constancy
of
his
hope
in
god
certainly
contemplates
the
felicity
reserved
for
him
in
another
world
to
this
contemplation
he
frequently
recalls
the
faithful
whenever
he
wishes
to
afford
them
true
consolation
for
in
another
place
after
having
spoken
of
the
brevity
and
the
transitory
nature
of
human
life
he
adds
but
the
mercy
of
the
lord
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
upon
them
that
fear
similar
to
which
is
the
following
of
old
hast
thou
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
and
the
heavens
are
the
work
of
thy
hands
they
shall
perish
but
thou
shalt
endure
yea
all
of
them
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
as
a
vesture
shalt
thou
change
them
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
the
same
and
thy
years
shall
have
no
end
the
children
of
thy
servants
shall
continue
and
their
seed
shall
be
established
before
if
notwithstanding
the
destruction
of
heaven
and
earth
the
pious
cease
not
to
be
established
before
the
lord
it
follows
that
their
salvation
is
connected
with
his
eternity
but
this
hope
can
not
be
at
all
supported
unless
it
rest
on
the
promise
which
we
find
in
isaiah
the
heavens
saith
the
lord
shall
vanish
away
like
smoke
and
the
earth
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
and
they
that
dwell
therein
shall
die
in
like
manner
but
my
salvation
shall
be
for
ever
and
my
righteousness
shall
not
be
abolished
where
perpetuity
is
ascribed
to
righteousness
and
salvation
considered
not
as
resident
in
god
but
as
experienced
by
men
xvi
nor
can
what
he
frequently
says
concerning
the
prosperity
of
the
faithful
be
understood
in
any
other
sense
than
as
referring
to
the
manifestation
of
the
glory
of
heaven
such
are
the
following
passages
the
lord
preserveth
the
souls
of
his
saints
he
delivereth
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
light
is
sown
for
the
righteous
and
gladness
for
the
upright
in
again
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
endureth
for
ever
his
horn
shall
be
exalted
with
honour
the
desire
of
the
wicked
shall
again
surely
the
righteous
shall
give
thanks
unto
thy
name
the
upright
shall
dwell
in
thy
again
the
righteous
shall
be
had
in
everlasting
again
the
lord
redeemeth
the
soul
of
his
for
the
lord
frequently
leaves
his
servants
to
the
rage
of
the
impious
not
only
to
be
harassed
but
to
be
torn
asunder
and
ruined
he
suffers
good
men
to
languish
in
obscurity
and
meanness
while
the
impious
are
almost
as
glorious
as
the
stars
nor
does
he
exhilarate
the
faithful
with
the
light
of
his
countenance
so
that
they
can
enjoy
any
lasting
pleasure
wherefore
david
does
not
dissemble
that
if
the
faithful
fix
their
eyes
on
the
present
state
of
things
they
will
be
most
grievously
tempted
with
an
apprehension
lest
innocence
should
obtain
from
god
neither
favour
nor
reward
so
much
does
impiety
in
most
cases
prosper
and
flourish
while
the
pious
are
oppressed
with
ignominy
poverty
contempt
and
distress
of
every
kind
my
feet
says
he
were
almost
gone
my
steps
had
well
nigh
slipped
for
i
was
envious
at
the
foolish
when
i
saw
the
prosperity
of
the
at
length
he
concludes
his
account
of
them
when
i
thought
to
know
this
it
was
too
painful
for
me
until
i
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
god
then
understood
i
their
xvii
we
may
learn
then
even
from
this
confession
of
david
that
the
holy
fathers
under
the
old
testament
were
not
ignorant
that
god
rarely
or
never
in
this
world
gives
his
servants
those
things
which
he
promises
them
and
that
therefore
they
elevated
their
minds
to
the
sanctuary
of
god
where
they
had
a
treasure
in
reserve
which
is
not
visible
amid
the
shadows
of
the
present
life
this
sanctuary
was
the
last
judgment
which
not
being
discernible
by
their
eyes
they
were
contented
to
apprehend
by
faith
relying
on
this
confidence
whatever
events
might
befall
them
in
the
world
they
nevertheless
had
no
doubt
that
there
would
come
a
time
when
the
divine
promises
would
be
fulfilled
this
is
evident
from
the
following
passages
i
will
behold
thy
face
in
righteousness
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
again
i
am
like
a
green
in
the
house
of
again
the
righteous
shall
flourish
like
the
he
shall
grow
like
a
cedar
in
lebanon
those
that
be
planted
in
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
flourish
in
the
courts
of
our
god
they
shall
still
bring
forth
fruit
in
old
age
they
shall
be
fat
and
he
had
just
before
said
o
lord
how
great
are
thy
works
and
thy
thoughts
are
very
deep
when
the
wicked
spring
as
the
grass
and
when
all
the
workers
of
iniquity
do
flourish
it
is
that
they
shall
be
destroyed
for
where
can
this
beauty
and
gracefulness
of
the
faithful
be
found
but
where
the
appearance
of
this
world
has
been
reversed
by
the
manifestation
of
the
kingdom
of
god
when
they
could
turn
their
eyes
towards
that
eternity
despising
the
momentary
rigour
of
present
calamities
they
securely
broke
forth
into
the
following
expressions
the
lord
shall
never
suffer
the
righteous
to
be
moved
but
thou
o
god
shalt
bring
them
wicked
men
down
into
the
pit
of
where
in
this
world
is
the
pit
of
destruction
to
absorb
the
wicked
as
an
instance
of
whose
felicity
it
is
mentioned
in
another
place
that
without
languishing
for
any
long
time
they
go
down
to
the
grave
in
a
moment
where
is
that
great
stability
of
the
saints
whom
david
himself
in
the
language
of
complaint
frequently
represents
as
not
only
troubled
but
oppressed
and
consumed
he
certainly
had
in
view
not
any
thing
that
results
from
the
agitations
of
the
world
which
are
even
more
tumultuous
than
those
of
the
sea
but
what
will
be
accomplished
by
the
lord
when
he
shall
one
day
sit
in
judgment
to
fix
the
everlasting
destiny
of
heaven
and
earth
this
appears
from
another
psalm
in
which
he
gives
the
following
beautiful
description
they
that
trust
in
their
wealth
and
boast
themselves
in
the
multitude
of
their
riches
none
of
them
can
by
any
means
redeem
his
brother
nor
give
to
god
a
ransom
for
him
for
he
seeth
that
wise
men
die
likewise
the
fool
and
the
brutish
person
perish
and
leave
their
wealth
to
others
their
inward
thought
is
that
their
houses
shall
continue
for
ever
and
their
to
all
generations
they
call
their
lands
after
their
own
names
nevertheless
man
being
in
honour
abideth
not
he
is
like
the
beasts
that
perish
this
their
way
is
their
folly
yet
their
posterity
approve
their
sayings
like
sheep
they
are
laid
in
the
grave
death
shall
feed
on
them
and
the
upright
shall
have
dominion
over
them
in
the
morning
and
their
beauty
shall
consume
in
the
grave
from
their
in
the
first
place
this
derision
of
fools
for
placing
their
dependence
on
the
mutable
and
transitory
blessings
of
the
world
shows
that
the
wise
ought
to
seek
a
very
different
felicity
but
he
more
evidently
discloses
the
mystery
of
the
resurrection
when
he
establishes
the
reign
of
the
pious
after
the
ruin
and
destruction
of
the
wicked
for
what
shall
we
understand
by
the
morning
which
he
mentions
but
the
revelation
of
a
new
life
commencing
after
the
conclusion
of
the
present
xviii
hence
arose
that
reflection
which
served
the
faithful
as
a
consolation
under
their
miseries
and
a
remedy
for
their
sufferings
the
anger
of
the
lord
endureth
but
a
moment
in
his
favour
is
how
did
they
limit
their
afflictions
to
a
moment
who
were
afflicted
all
their
lifetime
when
did
they
perceive
so
long
a
duration
of
the
divine
goodness
of
which
they
had
scarcely
the
smallest
taste
if
their
views
had
been
confined
to
the
earth
they
could
have
made
no
such
discovery
but
as
they
directed
their
eyes
towards
heaven
they
perceived
that
the
afflictions
with
which
the
lord
exercises
his
saints
are
but
for
a
small
moment
and
that
the
mercies
with
which
he
gathers
them
are
on
the
other
hand
they
foresaw
the
eternal
and
perdition
of
the
impious
who
had
been
happy
as
in
a
dream
for
a
single
day
hence
the
following
sentiments
the
memory
of
the
just
is
blessed
but
the
name
of
the
wicked
shall
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
also
in
samuel
the
lord
will
keep
the
feet
of
his
saints
and
the
wicked
shall
be
silent
in
these
expressions
suggest
to
us
that
they
well
knew
that
whatever
vicissitudes
may
befall
the
saints
yet
their
last
end
will
be
life
and
salvation
and
that
the
prosperity
of
the
impious
is
a
pleasant
path
which
gradually
leads
to
the
gulf
of
everlasting
death
therefore
they
called
the
death
of
such
the
destruction
of
the
uncircumcised
as
of
those
from
whom
all
hope
of
resurrection
had
been
cut
off
wherefore
david
could
not
conceive
a
more
grievous
imprecation
than
this
let
them
be
blotted
out
of
the
book
of
the
living
and
not
be
written
with
the
xix
but
the
following
declaration
of
job
is
remarkable
beyond
all
others
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
and
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
whom
i
shall
see
for
myself
and
mine
eyes
shall
behold
and
not
some
who
wish
to
display
their
critical
sagacity
cavil
that
this
is
not
to
be
understood
of
the
final
resurrection
but
even
of
the
first
day
on
which
job
expected
god
to
be
more
propitious
to
him
though
we
partly
concede
this
we
shall
extort
an
acknowledgment
from
them
whether
they
are
willing
or
not
that
job
could
never
have
attained
to
such
an
enlarged
hope
if
his
thoughts
had
been
confined
to
the
earth
we
must
therefore
be
obliged
to
confess
that
he
who
saw
that
his
redeemer
would
be
present
with
him
even
when
lying
in
the
sepulchre
must
have
elevated
his
views
to
a
future
immortality
for
to
them
who
think
only
of
the
present
life
death
is
a
source
of
extreme
despair
which
however
could
not
annihilate
his
hope
though
he
slay
me
said
he
yet
will
i
trust
in
nor
let
any
trifler
here
object
that
these
were
the
expressions
of
a
few
persons
and
are
far
from
furnishing
proof
that
such
a
doctrine
was
current
among
the
jews
i
will
immediately
reply
that
these
few
persons
did
not
in
these
declarations
reveal
any
recondite
wisdom
in
which
only
superior
understandings
were
separately
and
privately
instructed
but
that
the
holy
spirit
having
constituted
them
teachers
of
the
people
they
publicly
promulgated
the
divine
mysteries
which
were
to
be
generally
received
and
to
be
the
principles
of
the
popular
religion
when
we
hear
the
public
oracles
of
the
holy
spirit
therefore
in
which
he
has
so
clearly
and
evidently
spoken
of
the
spiritual
life
in
the
jewish
church
it
would
be
intolerable
perverseness
to
apply
them
entirely
to
the
carnal
covenant
in
which
no
mention
is
made
but
of
the
earth
and
earthly
opulence
xx
if
we
descend
to
the
later
prophets
there
we
may
freely
expatiate
as
quite
at
home
for
if
it
was
not
difficult
to
prove
our
point
from
david
job
and
samuel
we
shall
do
it
there
with
much
greater
facility
for
this
is
the
order
and
economy
which
god
observed
in
dispensing
the
covenant
of
his
mercy
that
as
the
course
of
time
accelerated
the
period
of
its
full
exhibition
he
illustrated
it
from
day
to
day
with
additional
revelations
therefore
in
the
beginning
when
the
first
promise
was
given
to
adam
it
was
like
the
kindling
of
some
feeble
sparks
subsequent
accessions
caused
a
considerable
enlargement
of
the
light
which
continued
to
increase
more
and
more
and
diffused
its
splendour
through
a
wide
extent
till
at
length
every
cloud
being
dissipated
christ
the
sun
of
righteousness
completely
illuminated
the
whole
world
there
is
no
reason
to
fear
therefore
if
we
want
the
suffrages
of
the
prophets
in
support
of
our
cause
that
they
will
fail
us
but
as
i
perceive
it
would
be
a
very
extensive
field
which
would
engross
more
of
our
attention
than
the
nature
of
our
design
will
admit
it
would
furnish
matter
for
a
large
volume
as
i
also
think
that
by
what
has
been
already
said
i
have
prepared
the
way
even
for
a
reader
of
small
penetration
to
proceed
without
any
difficulties
i
shall
abstain
from
a
prolixity
which
at
present
is
not
very
necessary
i
shall
only
caution
the
reader
to
advance
with
the
clew
which
we
have
put
into
his
hand
namely
that
whenever
the
prophets
mention
the
blessedness
of
the
faithful
scarcely
any
vestiges
of
which
are
discernible
in
the
present
life
he
should
recur
to
this
distinction
that
in
order
to
the
better
elucidation
of
the
divine
goodness
the
prophets
represented
it
to
the
people
in
a
figurative
manner
but
that
they
gave
such
a
representation
of
it
as
would
withdraw
the
mind
from
earth
and
time
and
the
elements
of
this
world
all
which
must
ere
long
perish
and
would
necessarily
excite
to
a
contemplation
of
the
felicity
of
the
future
spiritual
life
xxi
we
will
content
ourselves
with
one
example
when
the
israelites
after
being
carried
to
babylon
perceived
how
very
much
their
dispersion
resembled
a
death
they
could
scarcely
be
convinced
that
the
prophecy
of
ezekiel
concerning
their
restitution
was
not
a
mere
fable
for
they
considered
it
in
the
same
light
as
if
he
had
announced
that
putrid
carcasses
would
be
restored
to
life
the
lord
in
order
to
show
that
even
that
difficulty
would
not
prevent
him
from
displaying
his
beneficence
gave
the
prophet
a
vision
of
a
field
full
of
dry
bones
which
he
instantaneously
restored
to
life
and
vigour
solely
by
the
power
of
his
word
the
vision
served
indeed
to
correct
the
existing
incredulity
but
at
the
same
time
it
reminded
the
jews
how
far
the
power
of
the
lord
extended
beyond
the
restoration
of
the
people
since
the
mere
expression
of
his
will
so
easily
reanimated
the
dry
and
dispersed
bones
wherefore
you
may
properly
compare
that
passage
with
another
of
isaiah
thy
dead
men
shall
live
together
with
my
dead
body
shall
they
arise
awake
and
sing
ye
that
dwell
in
dust
for
thy
dew
is
as
the
dew
of
herbs
and
the
earth
shall
cast
out
the
dead
come
my
people
enter
thou
into
thy
chambers
and
shut
thy
doors
about
thee
hide
thyself
as
it
were
for
a
little
moment
until
the
indignation
be
overpast
for
behold
the
lord
cometh
out
of
his
place
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
for
their
iniquity
the
earth
also
shall
disclose
her
blood
and
shall
no
more
cover
her
xxii
it
would
be
absurd
however
to
attempt
to
reduce
every
passage
to
such
a
canon
of
interpretation
for
there
are
some
places
which
show
without
any
disguise
the
future
immortality
which
awaits
the
faithful
in
the
kingdom
of
god
such
are
some
which
we
have
recited
and
such
are
many
others
but
particularly
these
two
one
in
isaiah
as
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
which
i
will
make
shall
remain
before
me
saith
the
lord
so
shall
your
seed
and
your
name
remain
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
from
one
new
moon
to
another
and
from
one
sabbath
to
another
shall
all
flesh
come
to
worship
before
me
saith
the
lord
and
they
shall
go
forth
and
look
upon
the
carcasses
of
the
men
that
have
transgressed
against
me
for
their
worm
shall
not
die
neither
shall
their
fire
be
and
another
in
daniel
at
that
time
shall
michael
stand
up
the
great
prince
which
standeth
for
the
children
of
thy
people
and
there
shall
be
a
time
of
trouble
such
as
never
was
since
there
was
a
nation
even
to
that
same
time
and
at
that
time
thy
people
shall
be
delivered
every
one
that
shall
be
found
written
in
the
book
and
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake
some
to
everlasting
life
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
xxiii
now
the
two
remaining
points
that
the
fathers
had
christ
as
the
pledge
of
their
covenant
and
that
they
reposed
in
him
all
their
confidence
of
the
blessing
being
less
controvertible
and
more
plain
i
shall
take
no
pains
to
prove
them
we
may
safely
conclude
therefore
what
all
the
machinations
of
the
devil
can
never
subvert
that
the
old
testament
or
covenant
which
the
lord
made
with
the
israelitish
nation
was
not
limited
to
terrestrial
things
but
contained
a
promise
of
spiritual
and
eternal
life
the
expectation
of
which
must
have
been
impressed
on
the
minds
of
all
who
truly
consented
to
the
covenant
then
let
us
drive
far
away
from
us
this
absurd
and
pernicious
notion
either
that
the
lord
proposed
nothing
else
to
the
jews
or
that
the
jews
sought
nothing
else
but
an
abundance
of
food
carnal
delights
flourishing
wealth
external
power
a
numerous
offspring
and
whatever
is
esteemed
valuable
by
a
natural
man
for
under
the
present
dispensation
christ
promises
to
his
people
no
other
kingdom
of
heaven
than
where
they
may
sit
down
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
and
peter
asserted
the
jews
of
his
time
to
be
heirs
of
the
grace
of
the
gospel
when
he
said
that
they
were
the
children
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
covenant
which
god
made
with
their
and
that
this
might
not
only
be
testified
in
words
the
lord
also
proved
it
by
a
matter
of
fact
for
on
the
day
in
which
he
rose
from
the
dead
he
honoured
many
of
the
saints
with
a
participation
of
his
resurrection
and
caused
them
to
appear
in
the
city
thus
furnishing
a
certain
assurance
that
whatever
he
did
and
suffered
for
the
acquisition
of
eternal
salvation
belonged
to
the
faithful
of
the
old
testament
as
much
as
to
us
for
as
peter
declares
they
also
were
endued
with
the
same
spirit
who
is
the
author
of
our
regeneration
to
life
when
we
are
informed
that
the
same
spirit
which
is
as
it
were
a
spark
of
immortality
in
us
and
is
therefore
called
in
one
place
the
earnest
of
our
inheritance
dwelt
in
a
similar
manner
in
them
how
can
we
dare
to
deprive
them
of
the
inheritance
of
eternal
life
it
is
therefore
the
more
surprising
that
the
sadducees
formerly
fell
into
such
stupidity
as
to
deny
the
resurrection
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
since
they
had
proofs
of
these
points
from
such
clear
testimonies
of
scripture
and
the
folly
of
the
whole
nation
of
the
jews
in
the
present
age
in
expecting
an
earthly
kingdom
of
the
messiah
would
be
equally
extraordinary
had
not
the
scriptures
long
before
predicted
that
they
would
thus
be
punished
for
their
rejection
of
the
gospel
for
it
was
consistent
with
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
to
strike
with
blindness
the
minds
of
those
who
rejecting
the
light
of
heaven
when
presented
to
them
kept
themselves
in
voluntary
darkness
therefore
they
read
moses
and
assiduously
turn
over
his
pages
but
are
prevented
by
an
interposing
veil
from
perceiving
the
light
which
beams
in
his
countenance
and
thus
it
will
remain
covered
and
concealed
to
them
till
they
are
converted
to
christ
from
whom
they
now
endeavour
as
much
as
they
can
to
withdraw
and
divert
it
chapter
xi
the
difference
of
the
two
testaments
what
then
it
will
be
said
will
there
be
no
difference
left
between
the
old
testament
and
the
new
and
what
becomes
of
all
those
passages
of
scripture
where
they
are
compared
together
as
things
that
are
very
different
i
readily
admit
the
differences
which
are
mentioned
in
the
scripture
but
i
maintain
that
they
derogate
nothing
from
the
unity
already
established
as
will
be
seen
when
we
have
discussed
them
in
proper
order
but
the
principal
differences
as
far
as
my
observation
or
memory
extends
are
four
in
number
to
which
if
any
one
choose
to
add
a
fifth
i
shall
not
make
the
least
objection
i
assert
and
engage
to
demonstrate
that
all
these
are
such
as
pertain
rather
to
the
mode
of
administration
than
to
the
substance
in
this
view
they
will
not
prevent
the
promises
of
the
old
and
new
testament
from
remaining
the
same
and
the
promises
of
both
testaments
from
having
in
christ
the
same
foundation
now
the
first
difference
is
that
although
it
was
always
the
will
of
the
lord
that
the
minds
of
his
people
should
be
directed
and
their
hearts
elevated
towards
the
celestial
inheritance
yet
in
order
that
they
might
be
the
better
encouraged
to
hope
for
it
he
anciently
exhibited
it
for
their
contemplation
and
partial
enjoyment
under
the
figures
of
terrestrial
blessings
now
having
by
the
gospel
more
clearly
and
explicitly
revealed
the
grace
of
the
future
life
he
leaves
the
inferior
mode
of
instruction
which
he
used
with
the
israelites
and
directs
our
minds
to
the
immediate
contemplation
of
it
those
who
overlook
this
design
of
god
suppose
that
the
ancients
ascended
no
higher
than
the
corporeal
blessings
which
were
promised
them
they
so
frequently
hear
the
land
of
canaan
mentioned
as
the
eminent
and
indeed
the
only
reward
for
the
observers
of
the
divine
law
they
hear
that
god
threatens
the
transgressors
of
this
law
with
nothing
more
severe
than
being
expelled
from
the
possession
of
that
country
and
dispersed
into
foreign
lands
they
see
this
to
be
nearly
the
whole
substance
of
all
the
blessings
and
of
all
the
curses
pronounced
by
moses
hence
they
confidently
conclude
that
the
jews
were
separated
from
other
nations
not
for
their
own
sakes
but
for
ours
that
the
christian
church
might
have
an
image
in
whose
external
form
they
could
discern
examples
of
spiritual
things
but
since
the
scripture
frequently
shows
that
god
himself
appointed
the
terrestrial
advantages
with
which
he
favoured
them
for
the
express
purpose
of
leading
them
to
the
hope
of
celestial
blessings
it
argued
extreme
inexperience
not
to
say
stupidity
not
to
consider
such
a
dispensation
the
point
of
controversy
between
us
and
these
persons
is
this
they
maintain
that
the
possession
of
the
land
of
canaan
was
accounted
by
the
israelites
their
supreme
and
ultimate
blessedness
but
that
to
us
since
the
revelation
of
christ
it
is
a
figure
of
the
heavenly
inheritance
we
on
the
contrary
contend
that
in
the
earthly
possession
which
they
enjoyed
they
contemplated
as
in
a
mirror
the
future
inheritance
which
they
believed
to
be
prepared
for
them
in
heaven
ii
this
will
more
fully
appear
from
the
similitude
which
paul
has
used
in
his
epistle
to
the
galatians
he
compares
the
jewish
nation
to
a
young
heir
who
being
yet
incapable
of
governing
himself
follows
the
dictates
of
a
tutor
or
a
governor
to
whose
charge
he
has
been
committed
his
application
of
this
similitude
chiefly
to
the
ceremonies
is
no
objection
against
the
propriety
of
its
application
to
our
present
purpose
the
same
inheritance
was
destined
for
them
as
for
us
but
they
were
not
of
a
sufficient
age
to
be
capable
of
entering
on
the
possession
and
management
of
it
the
church
among
them
was
the
same
as
among
us
but
it
was
yet
in
a
state
of
childhood
therefore
the
lord
kept
them
under
this
tuition
that
he
might
give
them
the
spiritual
promises
not
open
and
unconcealed
but
veiled
under
terrestrial
figures
therefore
when
he
admitted
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
with
their
posterity
to
the
hope
of
immortality
he
promised
them
the
land
of
canaan
as
their
inheritance
not
that
their
hopes
might
terminate
in
that
land
but
that
in
the
prospect
of
it
they
might
exercise
and
confirm
themselves
in
the
hope
of
that
true
inheritance
which
was
not
yet
visible
and
that
they
might
not
be
deceived
a
superior
promise
was
given
them
which
proved
that
country
not
to
be
the
highest
blessing
which
god
would
bestow
thus
abraham
is
not
permitted
to
grow
indolent
after
having
received
a
promise
of
the
land
but
a
greater
promise
elevates
his
mind
to
the
lord
for
he
hears
him
saying
abram
i
am
thy
shield
and
thy
exceeding
great
here
we
see
that
the
lord
proposes
himself
to
abraham
as
his
ultimate
reward
that
he
may
not
seek
an
uncertain
and
transitory
one
in
the
elements
of
this
world
but
may
consider
that
which
can
never
fade
away
god
afterwards
annexes
a
promise
of
the
land
merely
as
a
symbol
of
his
benevolence
and
a
type
of
the
heavenly
inheritance
and
that
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
saints
is
plain
from
their
own
language
thus
david
rises
from
temporary
blessings
to
that
consummate
and
ultimate
felicity
my
soul
longeth
yea
even
fainteth
for
the
courts
of
the
god
is
my
portion
for
again
the
lord
is
the
portion
of
mine
inheritance
and
of
my
cup
thou
maintainest
my
again
i
cried
unto
thee
o
lord
i
said
thou
art
my
refuge
and
my
portion
in
the
land
of
the
persons
who
venture
to
express
themselves
thus
certainly
profess
that
in
their
hopes
they
rise
above
the
world
and
all
present
blessings
nevertheless
the
prophets
frequently
describe
this
blessedness
of
the
future
world
under
the
type
which
the
lord
had
given
them
in
this
sense
we
must
understand
the
following
passages
the
righteous
shall
inherit
the
land
but
the
wicked
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
earth
and
various
predictions
of
isaiah
which
foretell
the
future
prosperity
of
jerusalem
and
the
abundance
that
will
be
enjoyed
in
zion
we
see
that
all
these
things
are
inapplicable
to
the
land
of
our
pilgrimage
or
to
the
earthly
jerusalem
but
that
they
belong
to
the
true
country
of
the
faithful
and
to
that
celestial
city
where
the
lord
commanded
the
blessing
even
life
for
iii
this
is
the
reason
why
the
saints
under
the
old
testament
are
represented
as
holding
this
mortal
life
with
its
blessings
in
higher
estimation
than
becomes
us
now
for
although
they
well
knew
that
they
ought
not
to
rest
in
it
as
the
end
of
their
course
yet
when
they
recollected
what
characters
of
his
grace
the
lord
had
impressed
on
it
in
order
to
instruct
them
in
a
manner
suitable
to
their
tender
state
they
felt
a
greater
degree
of
pleasure
in
it
than
if
they
had
considered
it
merely
in
itself
but
as
the
lord
in
declaring
his
benevolence
to
the
faithful
by
present
blessings
gave
them
under
these
types
and
symbols
a
figurative
exhibition
of
spiritual
felicity
so
on
the
other
hand
in
corporal
punishments
he
exemplified
his
judgment
against
the
reprobate
therefore
as
the
favours
of
god
were
more
conspicuous
in
earthly
things
so
also
were
his
punishments
injudicious
persons
not
considering
this
analogy
and
harmony
so
to
speak
between
the
punishments
and
rewards
wonder
at
so
great
a
variety
in
god
that
in
ancient
times
he
was
ready
to
avenge
all
the
transgressions
of
men
by
the
immediate
infliction
of
severe
and
dreadful
punishments
but
now
as
if
he
had
laid
aside
his
ancient
wrath
punishes
with
far
less
severity
and
frequency
and
on
this
account
they
almost
adopt
the
notion
of
the
manichæans
that
the
god
of
the
old
testament
is
a
different
being
from
the
god
of
the
new
but
we
shall
easily
get
rid
of
such
difficulties
if
we
direct
our
attention
to
that
dispensation
of
god
which
i
have
observed
namely
that
during
that
period
in
which
he
gave
the
israelites
his
covenant
involved
in
some
degree
of
obscurity
he
intended
to
signify
and
prefigure
the
grace
of
future
and
eternal
felicity
by
terrestrial
blessings
and
the
grievousness
of
spiritual
death
by
corporal
punishments
iv
another
difference
between
the
old
testament
and
the
new
consists
in
figures
because
the
former
in
the
absence
of
the
truth
displayed
merely
an
image
and
shadow
instead
of
the
body
but
the
latter
exhibits
the
present
truth
and
the
substantial
body
and
this
is
generally
mentioned
wherever
the
new
testament
is
opposed
to
the
old
but
is
treated
more
at
large
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
than
in
any
other
place
the
apostle
is
there
disputing
against
those
who
supposed
that
the
observance
of
the
mosaic
law
could
not
be
abolished
without
being
followed
by
the
total
ruin
of
religion
to
refute
this
error
he
adduces
the
prediction
of
the
psalmist
concerning
the
priesthood
of
christ
for
since
he
has
an
eternal
priesthood
committed
to
him
we
may
argue
the
certain
abolition
of
that
priesthood
in
which
new
priests
daily
succeeded
each
other
but
he
proves
the
superiority
of
the
appointment
of
this
new
priest
because
it
is
confirmed
with
an
oath
he
afterwards
adds
that
this
transfer
of
the
priesthood
implies
also
a
change
of
the
covenant
and
he
proves
that
this
change
was
necessary
because
such
was
the
imbecility
of
the
law
that
it
could
bring
nothing
to
perfection
then
he
proceeds
to
state
the
nature
of
this
imbecility
namely
that
the
law
prescribed
external
righteousnesses
consisting
in
carnal
ordinances
which
could
not
make
the
observers
of
them
perfect
as
pertaining
to
the
conscience
that
by
animal
victims
it
could
neither
expiate
sins
nor
procure
true
holiness
he
concludes
therefore
that
it
contained
a
shadow
of
good
things
to
come
but
not
the
very
image
of
the
things
and
that
consequently
it
had
no
other
office
but
to
serve
as
an
introduction
to
a
better
hope
which
is
exhibited
in
the
gospel
here
we
have
to
inquire
in
what
respect
the
legal
covenant
is
compared
with
the
evangelical
the
ministry
of
christ
with
the
ministry
of
moses
for
if
the
comparison
related
to
the
substance
of
the
promises
there
would
be
a
great
discordance
between
the
two
testaments
but
as
the
state
of
the
question
leads
us
to
a
different
point
we
must
attend
to
the
scope
of
the
apostle
in
order
to
discover
the
truth
let
us
then
bring
forward
the
covenant
which
god
has
once
made
which
is
eternal
and
never
to
be
abolished
the
accomplishment
whence
it
derives
its
establishment
and
ratification
is
christ
while
such
a
confirmation
was
waited
for
the
lord
by
moses
prescribed
ceremonies
to
serve
as
solemn
symbols
of
the
confirmation
it
came
to
be
a
subject
of
contention
whether
the
ceremonies
ordained
in
the
law
ought
to
cease
and
give
place
to
christ
now
though
these
ceremonies
were
only
accidents
or
concomitants
of
the
covenant
yet
being
the
instruments
of
its
administration
they
bear
the
name
of
the
covenant
as
it
is
common
to
give
to
other
sacraments
the
names
of
the
things
they
represent
in
a
word
therefore
what
is
here
called
the
old
testament
is
a
solemn
method
of
confirming
the
covenant
consisting
of
ceremonies
and
sacrifices
since
it
contains
nothing
substantial
unless
we
proceed
further
the
apostle
contends
that
it
ought
to
be
repealed
and
abrogated
in
order
to
make
way
for
christ
the
surety
and
mediator
of
a
better
testament
by
whom
eternal
sanctification
has
been
at
once
procured
for
the
elect
and
those
transgressions
obliterated
which
remained
under
the
law
or
if
you
prefer
it
take
the
following
statement
of
it
that
the
old
testament
of
the
lord
was
that
which
was
delivered
to
the
jews
involved
in
a
shadowy
and
inefficacious
observance
of
ceremonies
and
that
it
was
therefore
temporary
because
it
remained
as
it
were
in
suspense
till
it
was
supported
by
a
firm
and
substantial
confirmation
but
that
it
was
made
new
and
eternal
when
it
was
consecrated
and
established
by
the
blood
of
christ
whence
christ
calls
the
cup
which
he
gives
to
his
disciples
in
the
supper
the
cup
of
the
new
testament
in
his
blood
to
signify
that
when
the
testament
of
god
is
sealed
with
his
blood
the
truth
of
it
is
then
accomplished
and
thus
it
is
made
new
and
eternal
hence
it
appears
in
what
sense
the
apostle
said
that
the
jews
were
conducted
to
christ
by
the
tuition
of
the
law
before
he
was
manifested
in
the
flesh
he
confesses
also
that
they
were
children
and
heirs
of
god
but
such
as
on
account
of
their
age
required
to
be
kept
under
the
care
of
a
tutor
for
it
was
reasonable
that
before
the
sun
of
righteousness
was
risen
there
should
be
neither
such
a
full
blaze
of
revelation
nor
such
great
clearness
of
understanding
therefore
the
lord
dispensed
the
light
of
his
word
to
them
in
such
a
manner
that
they
had
yet
only
a
distant
and
obscure
prospect
of
it
paul
describes
this
slenderness
of
understanding
as
a
state
of
childhood
which
it
was
the
lord
s
will
to
exercise
in
the
elements
of
this
world
and
in
external
observances
as
rules
of
puerile
discipline
till
the
manifestation
of
christ
by
whom
the
knowledge
of
the
faithful
was
to
grow
to
maturity
christ
himself
alluded
to
this
distinction
when
he
said
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
john
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
god
is
what
discoveries
did
moses
and
the
prophets
make
to
their
contemporaries
they
afforded
them
some
taste
of
that
wisdom
which
was
in
after
times
to
be
clearly
manifested
and
gave
them
a
distant
prospect
of
its
future
splendour
but
when
christ
could
be
plainly
pointed
out
the
kingdom
of
god
was
revealed
for
in
him
are
discovered
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
by
which
we
penetrate
almost
into
the
furthest
recesses
of
heaven
vi
nor
is
it
any
objection
to
our
argument
that
scarcely
a
person
can
be
found
in
the
christian
church
who
is
to
be
compared
with
abraham
in
the
excellency
of
his
faith
or
that
the
prophets
were
distinguished
by
such
energy
of
the
spirit
as
even
at
this
day
is
sufficient
to
illuminate
the
whole
world
for
our
present
inquiry
is
not
what
grace
the
lord
has
conferred
on
a
few
but
what
is
the
ordinary
method
which
he
has
pursued
in
the
instruction
of
his
people
such
as
is
found
even
among
the
prophets
themselves
who
were
endued
with
peculiar
knowledge
above
others
for
their
preaching
is
obscure
as
relating
to
things
very
distant
and
is
comprehended
in
types
besides
notwithstanding
their
wonderful
eminence
in
knowledge
yet
because
they
were
under
a
necessity
of
submitting
to
the
same
tuition
as
the
rest
of
the
people
they
are
considered
as
sustaining
the
character
of
children
as
well
as
others
finally
none
of
them
possessed
knowledge
so
clear
as
not
to
partake
more
or
less
of
the
obscurity
of
the
age
whence
this
observation
of
christ
many
prophets
and
kings
have
desired
to
see
those
things
which
ye
see
and
have
not
seen
them
and
to
hear
those
things
which
ye
hear
and
have
not
heard
blessed
are
your
eyes
for
they
see
and
your
ears
for
they
and
indeed
it
is
reasonable
that
the
presence
of
christ
should
be
distinguished
by
the
prerogative
of
introducing
a
clearer
revelation
of
the
mysteries
of
heaven
to
the
same
purpose
also
is
the
passage
which
we
have
before
cited
from
the
first
epistle
of
peter
that
it
was
revealed
to
them
that
the
principal
advantage
of
their
labours
would
be
experienced
in
our
times
vii
i
come
now
to
the
third
difference
which
is
taken
from
jeremiah
whose
words
are
these
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
which
my
covenant
they
brake
although
i
was
a
husband
to
them
saith
the
lord
but
this
shall
be
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
saith
the
lord
i
will
put
my
law
in
their
inward
parts
and
write
it
in
their
hearts
and
will
be
their
god
and
they
shall
be
my
people
and
they
shall
teach
no
more
every
man
his
neighbour
and
every
man
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
for
they
shall
all
know
me
from
the
least
of
them
unto
the
greatest
of
them
saith
the
lord
for
i
will
forgive
their
iniquity
and
i
will
remember
their
sin
no
from
this
passage
the
apostle
took
occasion
to
institute
the
following
comparison
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
he
calls
the
former
a
literal
the
latter
a
spiritual
doctrine
the
former
he
says
was
engraven
on
tables
of
stone
but
the
latter
is
inscribed
on
the
heart
the
former
was
the
preaching
of
death
but
the
latter
of
life
the
former
was
the
ministration
of
condemnation
but
the
latter
of
righteousness
the
former
is
abolished
but
the
latter
remains
as
the
design
of
the
apostle
was
to
express
the
sense
of
the
prophet
it
will
be
sufficient
for
us
to
consider
the
language
of
one
of
them
in
order
to
discover
the
meaning
of
both
there
is
however
some
difference
between
them
for
the
apostle
speaks
of
the
law
in
less
honourable
terms
than
the
prophet
does
and
that
not
simply
with
respect
to
the
law
itself
but
because
there
were
some
disturbers
who
were
full
of
improper
zeal
for
the
law
and
by
their
perverse
attachment
to
the
ceremonies
obscured
the
glory
of
the
gospel
he
disputes
concerning
the
nature
of
the
law
with
reference
to
their
error
and
foolish
affection
for
it
this
peculiarity
in
paul
therefore
will
be
worthy
of
our
observation
both
of
them
as
they
contrast
the
old
and
new
testaments
with
each
other
consider
nothing
in
the
law
but
what
properly
belongs
to
it
for
example
the
law
contains
frequent
promises
of
mercy
but
as
they
are
borrowed
from
another
dispensation
they
are
not
considered
as
part
of
the
law
when
the
mere
nature
of
the
law
is
the
subject
of
discussion
all
that
they
attribute
to
it
is
that
it
enjoins
what
is
right
and
prohibits
crimes
that
it
proclaims
a
reward
for
the
followers
of
righteousness
and
denounces
punishments
against
transgressors
but
that
it
neither
changes
nor
corrects
the
depravity
of
heart
which
is
natural
to
all
men
viii
now
let
us
explain
the
comparison
of
the
apostle
in
all
its
branches
in
the
first
place
the
old
testament
is
literal
because
it
was
promulgated
without
the
efficacy
of
the
spirit
the
new
is
spiritual
because
the
lord
has
engraven
it
in
a
spiritual
manner
on
the
hearts
of
men
the
second
contrast
therefore
serves
as
an
elucidation
of
the
first
the
old
testament
is
the
revelation
of
death
because
it
can
only
involve
all
mankind
in
a
curse
the
new
is
the
instrument
of
life
because
it
delivers
us
from
the
curse
and
restores
us
to
favour
with
god
the
former
is
the
ministry
of
condemnation
because
it
convicts
all
the
children
of
adam
of
unrighteousness
the
latter
is
the
ministry
of
righteousness
because
it
reveals
the
mercy
of
god
by
which
we
are
made
righteous
the
last
contrast
must
be
referred
to
the
legal
ceremonies
the
law
having
an
image
of
things
that
were
at
a
distance
it
was
necessary
that
in
time
it
should
be
abolished
and
disappear
the
gospel
exhibiting
the
body
itself
retains
a
firm
and
perpetual
stability
jeremiah
calls
even
the
moral
law
a
weak
and
frail
covenant
but
for
another
reason
namely
because
it
was
soon
broken
by
the
sudden
defection
of
an
ungrateful
people
but
as
such
a
violation
arises
from
the
fault
of
the
people
it
can
not
be
properly
attributed
to
the
testament
the
ceremonies
however
which
at
the
advent
of
christ
were
abolished
by
their
own
weakness
contained
in
themselves
the
cause
of
their
abrogation
now
this
difference
between
the
letter
and
the
spirit
is
not
to
be
understood
as
if
the
lord
had
given
his
law
to
the
jews
without
any
beneficial
result
without
one
of
them
being
converted
to
him
but
it
is
used
in
a
way
of
comparison
to
display
the
plenitude
of
grace
with
which
the
same
legislator
assuming
as
it
were
a
new
character
has
honoured
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
for
if
we
survey
the
multitude
of
those
from
among
all
nations
whom
by
the
influence
of
his
spirit
in
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
the
lord
has
regenerated
and
gathered
into
communion
with
his
church
we
shall
say
that
those
of
the
ancient
israelites
who
cordially
and
sincerely
embraced
the
covenant
of
the
lord
were
extremely
few
though
if
estimated
by
themselves
without
any
comparison
they
amounted
to
a
considerable
number
ix
the
fourth
difference
arises
out
of
the
third
for
the
scripture
calls
the
old
testament
a
covenant
of
bondage
because
it
produces
fear
in
the
mind
but
the
new
it
describes
as
a
covenant
of
liberty
because
it
leads
the
heart
to
confidence
and
security
thus
paul
in
the
eighth
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
romans
says
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
again
to
fear
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
we
cry
abba
to
the
same
purpose
is
that
passage
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
that
the
faithful
now
are
not
come
unto
the
mount
that
might
be
touched
and
that
burned
with
fire
nor
unto
blackness
and
darkness
and
tempest
where
nothing
can
be
either
heard
or
seen
but
what
must
strike
terror
into
the
mind
so
that
even
moses
himself
is
exceedingly
afraid
at
the
sound
of
the
terrible
voice
which
they
all
pray
that
they
may
hear
no
more
but
that
now
the
faithful
are
come
unto
mount
sion
and
unto
the
city
of
the
living
god
the
heavenly
jerusalem
what
paul
briefly
touches
in
the
passage
which
we
have
adduced
from
the
epistle
to
the
romans
he
explains
more
at
large
in
his
epistle
to
the
galatians
when
he
allegorizes
the
two
sons
of
abraham
in
the
following
agar
the
is
a
type
of
mount
sinai
where
the
people
of
israel
received
the
law
that
sarah
the
woman
is
a
figure
of
the
celestial
jerusalem
whence
proceeds
the
gospel
that
as
the
son
of
agar
is
born
in
bondage
and
can
never
attain
to
the
inheritance
and
the
son
of
sarah
is
born
free
and
has
a
right
to
the
inheritance
so
by
the
law
we
were
devoted
to
slavery
but
by
the
gospel
alone
are
regenerated
to
liberty
now
the
whole
may
be
summed
up
the
old
testament
filled
men
s
consciences
with
fear
and
trembling
but
that
by
the
benefit
of
the
new
testament
they
are
delivered
and
enabled
to
rejoice
the
former
kept
their
consciences
under
a
yoke
of
severe
bondage
but
by
the
liberality
of
the
latter
they
are
emancipated
and
admitted
to
liberty
if
any
one
object
to
us
the
case
of
the
holy
fathers
of
the
israelitish
people
that
as
they
were
clearly
possessed
of
the
same
spirit
of
faith
as
we
are
they
must
consequently
have
been
partakers
of
the
same
liberty
and
joy
we
reply
that
neither
of
these
originated
from
the
law
but
that
when
they
felt
themselves
by
means
of
the
law
oppressed
with
their
servile
condition
and
wearied
with
disquietude
of
conscience
they
fled
for
refuge
to
the
gospel
and
that
therefore
it
was
a
peculiar
advantage
of
the
new
testament
that
they
enjoyed
an
exception
from
the
common
law
of
the
old
testament
and
were
exempted
from
those
evils
besides
we
shall
deny
that
they
were
favoured
with
the
spirit
of
liberty
and
security
to
such
a
degree
as
not
to
experience
from
the
law
some
measure
both
of
fear
and
of
servitude
for
notwithstanding
their
enjoyment
of
that
privilege
which
they
obtained
by
the
grace
of
the
gospel
yet
they
were
subject
to
the
same
observances
and
burdens
as
the
people
in
general
as
they
were
obliged
therefore
to
a
diligent
observance
of
these
ceremonies
which
were
emblems
of
the
state
of
pupilage
similar
to
bondage
and
the
by
which
they
confessed
themselves
guilty
of
sin
did
not
release
them
from
the
obligation
they
may
justly
be
said
in
comparison
with
us
to
have
been
under
a
testament
of
bondage
and
fear
when
we
consider
the
common
mode
of
procedure
which
the
lord
then
pursued
with
the
israelitish
nation
x
the
three
last
comparisons
which
we
have
mentioned
are
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
in
these
therefore
the
old
testament
denotes
and
the
new
testament
the
first
comparison
extends
further
for
it
comprehends
also
the
promises
which
were
given
before
the
law
when
augustine
denied
that
they
ought
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
old
testament
he
gave
a
very
proper
opinion
and
intended
the
same
that
we
now
teach
for
he
had
in
view
those
passages
of
jeremiah
and
paul
in
which
the
old
testament
is
distinguished
from
the
word
of
grace
and
mercy
he
very
judiciously
adds
also
in
the
same
place
that
the
children
of
the
promise
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
who
have
been
regenerated
by
god
and
under
the
influence
of
faith
working
by
love
have
obeyed
his
commands
belong
to
the
new
testament
and
in
hope
not
of
carnal
terrestrial
and
temporal
things
but
of
spiritual
celestial
and
eternal
blessings
especially
believing
in
the
mediator
through
whom
they
doubted
not
that
the
spirit
was
dispensed
to
them
to
enable
them
to
do
their
duty
and
that
whenever
they
sinned
they
were
pardoned
for
this
is
the
very
same
thing
which
i
meant
to
assert
that
all
the
saints
whom
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
scripture
mentions
as
having
been
peculiarly
chosen
by
god
have
been
partakers
of
the
same
blessing
with
us
to
eternal
salvation
between
our
distinction
and
that
of
augustine
there
is
this
ours
according
to
this
declaration
of
christ
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
until
john
since
that
time
the
kingdom
of
god
is
preached
distinguishes
between
the
clearness
of
the
gospel
and
the
more
obscure
dispensation
of
the
word
which
preceded
it
whilst
the
other
merely
discriminates
the
weakness
of
the
law
from
the
stability
of
the
gospel
here
it
must
also
be
remarked
concerning
the
holy
fathers
that
though
they
lived
under
the
old
testament
they
did
not
rest
satisfied
with
it
but
always
aspired
after
the
new
and
thus
enjoyed
a
certain
participation
of
it
for
all
those
who
contented
themselves
with
present
shadows
and
did
not
extend
their
views
to
christ
are
condemned
by
the
apostle
as
blind
and
under
the
curse
for
to
say
nothing
on
other
points
what
greater
ignorance
can
be
imagined
than
to
hope
for
an
expiation
of
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
an
animal
than
to
seek
for
the
purification
of
the
soul
by
an
external
ablution
with
water
than
to
wish
to
appease
god
with
frigid
ceremonies
as
though
they
afforded
him
great
pleasure
for
all
these
absurdities
are
chargeable
on
those
who
adhere
to
the
observances
of
the
law
without
any
reference
to
christ
xi
the
fifth
difference
which
we
may
add
consists
in
till
the
advent
of
christ
the
lord
selected
one
nation
to
which
he
would
limit
the
covenant
of
his
grace
moses
says
when
the
most
high
divided
to
the
nations
their
inheritance
when
he
separated
the
sons
of
adam
lord
s
portion
is
his
people
jacob
is
the
lot
of
his
in
another
place
he
thus
addresses
the
people
behold
the
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
is
the
lord
s
thy
god
the
earth
also
with
all
that
therein
is
only
the
lord
had
a
delight
in
thy
fathers
to
love
them
and
he
chose
their
seed
after
them
even
you
above
all
therefore
he
favoured
that
people
with
the
exclusive
knowledge
of
his
name
as
though
they
alone
of
all
mankind
belonged
to
him
he
deposited
his
covenant
as
it
were
in
their
bosom
to
them
he
manifested
the
presence
of
his
power
he
honoured
them
with
every
privilege
but
to
omit
the
rest
of
his
benefits
the
only
one
that
relates
to
our
present
argument
is
that
he
united
them
to
himself
by
the
communication
of
his
word
in
order
that
he
might
be
denominated
and
esteemed
their
god
in
the
mean
time
he
suffered
other
nations
as
though
they
had
no
business
or
intercourse
with
him
to
walk
in
vanity
nor
did
he
employ
means
to
prevent
their
destruction
by
sending
them
the
only
preaching
of
his
word
the
israelitish
nation
therefore
were
then
as
darling
sons
others
were
strangers
they
were
known
to
him
and
received
under
his
faithful
protection
others
were
left
to
their
own
darkness
they
were
sanctified
by
god
others
were
profane
they
were
honoured
with
the
divine
presence
others
were
excluded
from
approaching
it
but
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come
appointed
for
the
restoration
of
all
things
and
the
reconciler
of
god
and
men
was
manifested
the
barrier
was
demolished
which
had
so
long
confined
the
divine
mercy
within
the
limits
of
the
jewish
church
and
peace
was
announced
to
them
who
were
at
a
distance
and
to
them
who
were
near
that
being
both
reconciled
to
god
they
might
coalesce
into
one
people
wherefore
there
is
neither
greek
nor
jew
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
but
christ
is
all
and
in
all
to
whom
the
heathen
are
given
for
his
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
his
possession
that
he
may
have
a
universal
dominion
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
river
unto
the
ends
of
the
xii
the
vocation
of
the
gentiles
therefore
is
an
eminent
illustration
of
the
superior
excellence
of
the
new
testament
above
the
old
it
had
indeed
before
been
most
explicitly
announced
in
numerous
predictions
of
the
prophets
but
so
as
that
the
completion
of
it
was
deferred
to
the
kingdom
of
the
messiah
and
even
christ
himself
made
no
advances
towards
it
at
the
first
commencement
of
his
preaching
but
deferred
it
till
he
should
have
completed
all
the
parts
of
our
redemption
finished
the
time
of
his
humiliation
and
received
from
the
father
a
name
which
is
above
every
name
before
which
every
knee
shall
wherefore
when
this
season
was
not
yet
arrived
he
said
to
a
canaanitish
woman
i
am
not
sent
but
unto
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
israel
nor
did
he
permit
the
apostles
in
his
first
mission
of
them
to
exceed
these
limits
go
not
says
he
into
the
way
of
the
gentiles
and
into
any
city
of
the
samaritans
enter
ye
not
but
go
rather
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
of
and
though
this
calling
of
the
gentiles
was
announced
by
so
many
testimonies
yet
when
the
apostles
were
about
to
enter
upon
it
it
appeared
to
them
so
novel
and
strange
that
they
dreaded
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
prodigy
indeed
it
was
with
trepidation
and
reluctance
that
they
at
length
engaged
in
it
nor
is
this
surprising
for
it
seemed
not
at
all
reasonable
that
the
lord
who
for
so
many
ages
had
separated
the
israelites
from
the
rest
of
the
nations
should
as
it
were
suddenly
change
his
design
and
annihilate
this
distinction
it
had
indeed
been
predicted
in
the
prophecies
but
they
could
not
pay
such
great
attention
to
the
prophecies
as
to
be
wholly
unmoved
with
the
novelty
of
the
circumstance
which
forced
itself
on
their
observation
nor
were
the
specimens
which
the
lord
had
formerly
given
of
the
future
vocation
of
the
gentiles
sufficient
to
influence
them
for
besides
his
having
called
only
very
few
of
them
he
had
even
incorporated
them
into
the
family
of
abraham
that
they
might
be
added
to
his
people
but
by
that
public
vocation
the
gentiles
were
not
only
raised
to
an
equality
with
the
jews
but
appeared
to
succeed
to
their
places
as
though
they
had
been
dead
besides
of
all
the
strangers
whom
god
had
before
incorporated
into
the
church
none
were
ever
placed
on
an
equality
with
the
jews
therefore
it
is
not
without
reason
that
paul
so
celebrates
this
mystery
which
was
hidden
from
ages
and
from
generations
and
which
he
represents
as
an
object
of
admiration
even
to
angels
xiii
in
these
four
or
five
points
i
think
i
have
given
a
correct
and
faithful
statement
of
the
whole
of
the
difference
between
the
old
and
the
new
testament
as
far
as
is
sufficient
for
a
simple
system
of
doctrine
but
because
some
persons
represent
this
variety
in
the
government
of
the
church
these
different
modes
of
instruction
and
such
a
considerable
alteration
of
rites
and
ceremonies
as
a
great
absurdity
we
must
reply
to
them
before
we
proceed
to
other
subjects
and
this
may
be
done
in
a
brief
manner
since
the
objections
are
not
so
strong
as
to
require
a
laborious
refutation
it
is
not
reasonable
they
say
that
god
who
is
perpetually
consistent
with
himself
should
undergo
so
great
a
change
as
afterwards
to
disallow
what
he
had
once
enjoined
and
commanded
i
reply
that
god
ought
not
therefore
to
be
deemed
mutable
because
he
has
accommodated
different
forms
to
different
ages
as
he
knew
would
be
suitable
for
each
if
the
husbandman
prescribes
different
employments
to
his
family
in
the
winter
from
those
which
he
allots
them
in
the
summer
we
must
not
therefore
accuse
him
of
inconstancy
or
impute
to
him
a
deviation
from
the
proper
rules
of
agriculture
which
are
connected
with
the
perpetual
course
of
nature
thus
also
if
a
father
instructs
governs
and
manages
his
children
one
way
in
infancy
another
in
childhood
and
another
in
youth
we
must
not
therefore
charge
him
with
being
inconstant
or
forsaking
his
own
designs
why
then
do
we
stigmatize
god
with
the
character
of
inconstancy
because
he
has
made
an
apt
and
suitable
distinction
between
different
times
the
last
similitude
ought
fully
to
satisfy
us
paul
compares
the
jews
to
children
and
christians
to
youths
what
impropriety
is
there
in
this
part
of
the
government
of
god
that
he
detained
them
in
the
rudiments
which
were
suitable
to
them
on
account
of
their
age
but
has
placed
us
under
a
stronger
and
more
manly
discipline
it
is
a
proof
therefore
of
the
constancy
of
god
that
he
has
delivered
the
same
doctrine
in
all
ages
and
perseveres
in
requiring
the
same
worship
of
his
name
which
he
commanded
from
the
beginning
by
changing
the
external
form
and
mode
he
has
discovered
no
mutability
in
himself
but
has
so
far
accommodated
himself
to
the
capacity
of
men
which
is
various
and
mutable
xiv
but
they
inquire
whence
this
diversity
proceeded
except
from
the
will
of
god
could
he
not
as
well
from
the
beginning
as
since
the
advent
of
christ
give
a
revelation
of
eternal
life
in
clear
language
without
any
figures
instruct
his
people
by
a
few
plain
sacraments
bestow
his
holy
spirit
and
diffuse
his
grace
through
all
the
world
this
is
just
the
same
as
if
they
were
to
quarrel
with
god
because
he
created
the
world
at
so
late
a
period
whereas
he
might
have
done
it
before
or
because
he
has
appointed
the
alternate
vicissitudes
of
summer
and
winter
of
day
and
night
but
let
us
not
doubt
what
ought
to
be
believed
by
all
pious
men
that
whatever
is
done
by
god
is
done
wisely
and
righteously
although
we
frequently
know
nothing
of
the
causes
which
render
such
transactions
necessary
for
it
would
be
arrogating
too
much
to
ourselves
not
to
permit
god
to
keep
the
reasons
of
his
decrees
concealed
from
us
but
it
is
surprising
say
they
that
he
now
rejects
and
abominates
the
sacrifices
of
cattle
and
all
the
apparatus
of
the
levitical
priesthood
with
which
he
used
to
be
delighted
as
though
truly
these
external
and
transitory
things
could
afford
pleasure
to
god
or
affect
him
in
any
way
whatever
it
has
already
been
observed
that
he
did
none
of
these
things
on
his
own
account
but
appointed
them
all
for
the
salvation
of
men
if
a
physician
cure
a
young
man
of
any
disease
by
a
very
excellent
method
and
afterwards
adopt
a
different
mode
of
cure
with
the
same
person
when
advanced
in
years
shall
we
therefore
say
that
he
rejects
the
method
of
cure
which
he
before
approved
we
will
rather
say
that
he
perseveres
in
the
same
system
and
considers
the
difference
of
age
thus
it
was
necessary
before
the
appearance
of
christ
that
he
should
be
prefigured
and
his
future
advent
announced
by
one
kind
of
emblems
since
he
has
been
manifested
it
is
right
that
he
should
be
represented
by
others
but
with
respect
to
the
divine
vocation
now
more
widely
extended
among
all
nations
since
the
advent
of
christ
than
it
was
before
and
with
regard
to
the
more
copious
effusion
of
the
graces
of
the
spirit
who
can
deny
that
it
is
reasonable
and
just
for
god
to
retain
under
his
own
power
and
will
the
free
dispensation
of
his
favours
that
he
may
illuminate
what
nations
he
pleases
that
wherever
he
pleases
he
may
introduce
the
preaching
of
his
word
that
he
may
give
to
his
instruction
whatever
kind
and
degree
of
profit
and
success
he
pleases
that
wherever
he
pleases
in
any
age
he
may
punish
the
ingratitude
of
the
world
by
depriving
them
of
the
knowledge
of
his
name
and
when
he
pleases
restore
it
on
account
of
his
mercy
we
see
therefore
the
absurdity
of
the
cavils
with
which
impious
men
disturb
the
minds
of
the
simple
on
this
subject
to
call
in
question
either
the
righteousness
of
god
or
the
truth
of
the
scripture
chapter
xii
the
necessity
of
christ
becoming
man
in
order
to
fulfil
the
office
of
mediator
it
was
of
great
importance
to
our
interests
that
he
who
was
to
be
our
mediator
should
be
both
true
god
and
true
man
if
an
inquiry
be
made
concerning
the
necessity
of
this
it
was
not
indeed
a
simple
or
as
we
commonly
say
an
absolute
necessity
but
such
as
arose
from
the
heavenly
decree
on
which
the
salvation
of
men
depended
but
our
most
merciful
father
has
appointed
that
which
was
best
for
us
for
since
our
iniquities
like
a
cloud
intervening
between
us
and
him
had
entirely
alienated
us
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
no
one
that
could
not
approach
to
god
could
be
a
mediator
for
the
restoration
of
peace
but
who
could
have
approached
to
him
could
any
one
of
the
children
of
adam
they
with
their
parent
all
dreaded
the
divine
presence
could
any
one
of
the
angels
they
also
stood
in
need
of
a
head
by
a
connection
with
whom
they
might
be
confirmed
in
a
perfect
and
unvarying
adherence
to
their
god
what
then
could
be
done
our
situation
was
truly
deplorable
unless
the
divine
majesty
itself
would
descend
to
us
for
we
could
not
ascend
to
it
thus
it
was
necessary
that
the
son
of
god
should
become
immanuel
that
is
god
with
us
and
this
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
mutual
union
and
coalition
between
his
divinity
and
the
nature
of
man
for
otherwise
the
proximity
could
not
be
sufficiently
near
nor
could
the
affinity
be
sufficiently
strong
to
authorize
us
to
hope
that
god
would
dwell
with
us
so
great
was
the
discordance
between
our
pollution
and
the
perfect
purity
of
god
although
man
had
remained
immaculately
innocent
yet
his
condition
would
have
been
too
mean
for
him
to
approach
to
god
without
a
mediator
what
then
can
he
do
after
having
been
plunged
by
his
fatal
fall
into
death
and
hell
defiled
with
so
many
blemishes
putrefying
in
his
own
corruption
and
in
a
word
overwhelmed
with
every
curse
it
is
not
without
reason
therefore
that
paul
when
about
to
exhibit
christ
in
the
character
of
a
mediator
expressly
speaks
of
him
as
a
man
there
is
one
mediator
he
says
between
god
and
man
the
man
christ
he
might
have
called
him
god
or
might
indeed
have
omitted
the
appellation
of
man
as
well
as
that
of
god
but
because
the
spirit
who
spake
by
him
knew
our
infirmity
he
has
provided
a
very
suitable
remedy
against
it
by
placing
the
son
of
god
familiarly
among
us
as
though
he
were
one
of
us
therefore
that
no
one
may
distress
himself
where
he
is
to
seek
the
mediator
or
in
what
way
he
may
approach
him
the
apostle
by
denominating
him
a
man
apprizes
us
that
he
is
near
and
even
close
to
us
since
he
is
our
own
flesh
he
certainly
intends
the
same
as
is
stated
in
another
place
more
at
that
we
have
not
a
high
priest
which
can
not
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities
but
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
we
are
yet
without
ii
this
will
still
more
fully
appear
if
we
consider
that
it
was
no
mean
part
which
the
mediator
had
to
perform
namely
to
restore
us
to
the
divine
favour
so
as
of
children
of
men
to
make
us
children
of
god
of
heirs
of
hell
to
make
us
heirs
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
who
could
accomplish
this
unless
the
son
of
god
should
become
also
the
son
of
man
and
thus
receive
to
himself
what
belongs
to
us
and
transfer
to
us
that
which
is
his
and
make
that
which
is
his
by
nature
ours
by
grace
depending
therefore
on
this
pledge
we
have
confidence
that
we
are
the
children
from
god
because
he
who
is
the
son
of
god
by
nature
has
provided
himself
a
body
from
our
body
flesh
from
our
flesh
bones
from
our
bones
that
he
might
be
the
same
with
us
he
refused
not
to
assume
that
which
was
peculiar
to
us
that
we
also
might
obtain
that
which
he
had
peculiar
to
him
and
that
so
in
common
with
us
he
might
be
both
the
son
of
god
and
the
son
of
man
hence
arises
that
holy
fraternity
which
he
mentions
with
his
own
mouth
in
the
following
words
i
ascend
unto
my
father
and
your
father
and
to
my
god
and
your
on
this
account
we
have
a
certainty
of
the
inheritance
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
because
the
only
son
of
god
to
whom
it
exclusively
belonged
has
adopted
us
as
his
brethren
and
if
we
are
his
brethren
we
are
consequently
heirs
to
the
inheritance
moreover
it
was
highly
necessary
also
for
this
reason
that
he
who
was
to
be
our
redeemer
should
be
truly
both
god
and
man
it
was
his
office
to
swallow
up
death
who
could
do
this
but
he
who
was
life
itself
it
was
his
to
overcome
sin
who
could
accomplish
this
but
righteousness
itself
it
was
his
to
put
to
flight
the
powers
of
the
world
and
of
the
air
who
could
do
this
but
a
power
superior
both
to
the
world
and
to
the
air
now
who
possesses
life
or
righteousness
or
the
empire
and
power
of
heaven
but
god
alone
therefore
the
most
merciful
god
when
he
determined
on
our
redemption
became
himself
our
redeemer
in
the
person
of
his
only
begotten
son
iii
another
branch
of
our
reconciliation
with
god
was
man
who
had
ruined
himself
by
his
own
disobedience
should
remedy
his
condition
by
obedience
should
satisfy
the
justice
of
god
and
suffer
the
punishment
of
his
sin
our
lord
then
made
his
appearance
as
a
real
man
he
put
on
the
character
of
adam
and
assumed
his
name
to
act
as
his
substitute
in
his
obedience
to
the
father
to
lay
down
our
flesh
as
the
price
of
satisfaction
to
the
justice
of
god
and
to
suffer
the
punishment
which
we
had
deserved
in
the
same
nature
in
which
the
offence
had
been
committed
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
therefore
for
one
who
was
only
god
to
suffer
death
or
for
one
who
was
a
mere
man
to
overcome
it
he
associated
the
human
nature
with
the
divine
that
he
might
submit
the
weakness
of
the
former
to
death
as
an
atonement
for
sins
and
that
with
the
power
of
the
latter
he
might
contend
with
death
and
obtain
a
victory
on
our
behalf
those
who
despoil
christ
therefore
either
of
his
divinity
or
his
humanity
either
diminish
his
majesty
and
glory
or
obscure
his
goodness
nor
are
they
on
the
other
hand
less
injurious
to
men
whose
faith
they
weaken
and
subvert
since
it
can
not
stand
any
longer
than
it
rests
upon
this
foundation
moreover
the
redeemer
to
be
expected
was
that
son
of
abraham
and
david
whom
god
had
promised
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
hence
the
minds
of
the
faithful
derive
another
advantage
because
from
the
circumstance
of
his
ancestry
being
traced
to
david
and
to
abraham
they
have
an
additional
assurance
that
this
is
the
christ
who
was
celebrated
in
so
many
prophecies
but
we
should
particularly
remember
what
i
have
just
our
common
nature
is
a
pledge
of
our
fellowship
with
the
son
of
god
that
clothed
in
our
flesh
he
vanquished
sin
and
death
in
order
that
the
victory
and
triumph
might
be
ours
that
the
flesh
which
he
received
from
us
he
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice
in
order
to
expiate
and
obliterate
our
guilt
and
appease
the
just
wrath
of
the
father
iv
the
persons
who
consider
these
things
with
the
diligent
attention
which
they
deserve
will
easily
disregard
vague
speculations
which
attract
minds
that
are
inconstant
and
fond
of
novelty
such
is
the
notion
that
christ
would
have
become
man
even
though
the
human
race
had
needed
no
redemption
i
grant
indeed
that
at
the
original
creation
and
in
the
state
of
integrity
he
was
exalted
as
head
over
angels
and
men
for
which
reason
paul
calls
him
the
of
every
creature
but
since
the
whole
scriptures
proclaim
that
he
was
clothed
in
flesh
in
order
to
become
a
redeemer
it
argues
excessive
temerity
to
imagine
another
cause
or
another
end
for
it
the
end
for
which
christ
was
promised
from
the
beginning
is
sufficiently
known
it
was
to
restore
a
fallen
world
and
to
succour
ruined
men
therefore
under
the
law
his
image
was
exhibited
in
sacrifices
to
inspire
the
faithful
with
a
hope
that
god
would
be
propitious
to
them
after
he
should
be
reconciled
by
the
expiation
of
their
sins
and
as
in
all
ages
even
before
the
promulgation
of
the
law
the
mediator
was
never
promised
without
blood
we
conclude
that
he
was
destined
by
the
eternal
decree
of
god
to
purify
the
pollution
of
men
because
the
effusion
of
blood
is
an
emblem
of
expiation
the
prophets
proclaimed
and
foretold
him
as
the
future
reconciler
of
god
and
men
as
a
sufficient
specimen
of
all
we
refer
to
that
very
celebrated
testimony
of
isaiah
where
he
predicts
that
he
should
be
smitten
of
god
for
the
transgressions
of
the
people
that
the
chastisement
of
their
peace
might
be
upon
him
and
that
he
should
be
a
priest
to
offer
up
himself
as
a
victim
that
by
his
stripes
others
should
be
healed
and
that
because
all
men
had
gone
astray
and
been
dispersed
like
sheep
it
had
pleased
the
lord
to
afflict
him
and
to
lay
on
him
the
iniquities
of
all
as
we
are
informed
that
christ
is
particularly
appointed
by
god
for
the
relief
of
miserable
sinners
all
who
pass
these
bounds
are
guilty
of
indulging
a
foolish
curiosity
when
he
himself
appeared
in
the
world
he
declared
the
design
of
his
advent
to
be
to
appease
god
and
restore
us
from
death
to
life
the
apostles
testified
the
same
thus
john
before
he
informs
us
that
the
word
was
made
flesh
mentions
the
defection
of
man
but
our
principal
attention
is
due
to
christ
himself
speaking
of
his
own
office
he
says
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
again
the
hour
is
coming
and
now
is
when
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
god
and
they
that
hear
shall
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
again
the
son
of
man
is
come
to
save
that
which
was
again
they
that
be
whole
need
not
a
there
would
be
no
end
if
i
meant
to
quote
all
the
passages
the
apostles
with
one
consent
call
us
back
to
this
principle
for
certainly
if
he
had
not
come
to
reconcile
god
the
honour
of
his
priesthood
would
have
been
lost
for
a
priest
is
appointed
as
a
mediator
to
intercede
between
god
and
men
he
could
not
have
been
our
righteousness
because
he
was
made
a
sacrifice
for
us
that
god
might
not
impute
sins
to
us
finally
he
would
have
been
despoiled
of
all
the
noble
characters
under
which
he
is
celebrated
in
the
scripture
this
assertion
of
paul
would
have
no
foundation
what
the
law
could
not
do
god
sending
his
own
son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
in
the
nor
would
there
be
any
truth
in
what
he
teaches
in
another
place
that
the
kindness
and
love
of
god
our
saviour
towards
man
appeared
in
the
gift
of
christ
as
a
redeemer
to
conclude
the
scripture
no
where
assigns
any
other
end
for
which
the
son
of
god
should
choose
to
become
incarnate
and
should
also
receive
this
command
from
the
father
than
that
he
might
be
made
a
sacrifice
to
appease
the
father
on
our
account
thus
it
is
written
and
thus
it
behoved
christ
to
suffer
and
that
repentance
should
be
preached
in
his
therefore
doth
my
father
love
me
because
i
lay
down
my
life
this
commandment
have
i
received
of
my
as
moses
lifted
up
the
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
so
must
the
son
of
man
be
lifted
again
father
save
me
from
this
hour
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
father
glorify
thy
where
he
clearly
assigns
as
the
end
of
his
assumption
of
human
nature
that
it
was
to
be
an
expiatory
sacrifice
for
the
abolition
of
sins
for
the
same
reason
zacharias
pronounces
that
he
is
come
according
to
the
promise
given
to
the
fathers
to
give
light
to
them
that
sit
in
the
shadow
of
let
us
remember
that
all
these
things
are
spoken
of
the
son
of
god
in
whom
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
are
hidden
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
and
besides
whom
he
glories
in
knowing
nothing
if
any
one
object
that
it
is
not
evinced
by
any
of
these
things
that
the
same
christ
who
has
redeemed
men
from
condemnation
could
not
have
testified
his
love
to
them
by
assuming
their
nature
if
they
had
remained
in
a
state
of
integrity
and
safety
briefly
reply
that
since
the
spirit
declares
these
two
things
christ
s
becoming
our
redeemer
and
his
participation
of
the
same
nature
to
have
been
connected
by
the
eternal
decree
of
god
it
is
not
right
to
make
any
further
inquiry
for
he
who
feels
an
eager
desire
to
know
something
more
not
being
content
with
the
immutable
appointment
of
god
shows
himself
also
not
to
be
contented
with
this
christ
who
has
been
given
to
us
as
the
price
of
our
redemption
paul
not
only
tells
us
the
end
of
his
mission
but
ascending
to
the
sublime
mystery
of
predestination
very
properly
represses
all
the
licentiousness
and
prurience
of
the
human
mind
by
declaring
that
the
father
hath
chosen
us
in
christ
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
predestinated
us
to
the
adoption
of
children
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
his
will
and
made
us
accepted
in
his
beloved
son
in
whom
we
have
redemption
through
his
here
the
fall
of
adam
is
certainly
not
presupposed
as
of
anterior
date
but
we
have
a
discovery
of
what
was
decreed
by
god
before
all
ages
when
he
determined
to
remedy
the
misery
of
mankind
if
any
adversary
object
again
that
this
design
of
god
depended
on
the
fall
of
man
which
he
foresaw
it
is
abundantly
sufficient
for
me
that
every
man
is
proceeding
with
impious
presumption
to
imagine
to
himself
a
new
christ
whoever
he
be
that
permits
himself
to
inquire
or
wishes
to
know
concerning
christ
any
more
than
god
has
predestinated
in
his
secret
decree
and
justly
does
paul
after
having
been
thus
treating
of
the
peculiar
office
of
christ
implore
on
behalf
of
the
ephesians
the
spirit
of
understanding
that
they
may
be
able
to
comprehend
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
knowledge
as
though
he
would
labour
to
surround
our
minds
with
barriers
that
wherever
mention
is
made
of
christ
they
may
not
decline
in
the
smallest
degree
from
the
grace
of
reconciliation
wherefore
since
this
is
testified
by
paul
to
be
a
faithful
saying
that
christ
jesus
came
into
the
world
to
save
sinners
i
gladly
acquiesce
in
it
and
since
the
same
apostle
in
another
place
informs
us
that
the
grace
which
is
now
made
manifest
by
the
gospel
was
given
us
in
christ
jesus
before
the
world
began
i
conclude
that
i
ought
to
persevere
in
the
same
doctrine
with
constancy
to
the
end
this
modesty
is
unreasonably
censured
by
osiander
who
in
the
present
age
has
unhappily
agitated
this
question
which
a
few
persons
had
slightly
touched
before
he
alleges
a
charge
of
presumption
against
those
who
deny
that
the
son
of
god
would
have
appeared
in
the
flesh
if
adam
had
never
fallen
because
this
tenet
is
contradicted
by
no
testimony
of
scripture
as
if
paul
laid
no
restraint
on
such
perverse
curiosity
when
after
having
spoken
of
the
accomplishment
of
our
redemption
by
christ
he
immediately
adds
this
injunction
avoid
foolish
the
frenzy
of
some
that
have
been
desirous
of
appearing
prodigiously
acute
has
proceeded
to
such
a
length
as
to
question
whether
the
son
of
god
could
assume
the
nature
of
an
ass
this
monstrous
supposition
which
all
pious
persons
justly
abhor
and
detest
osiander
excuses
under
this
pretext
that
it
is
nowhere
in
scripture
expressly
condemned
as
if
when
paul
esteems
nothing
valuable
or
worthy
of
being
known
but
christ
crucified
he
would
admit
an
ass
to
be
the
author
of
salvation
therefore
he
who
in
another
place
declares
that
christ
was
appointed
by
the
eternal
decree
of
the
father
as
the
head
over
all
would
never
acknowledge
any
other
who
had
not
been
appointed
to
the
office
of
a
redeemer
vi
but
the
principle
which
he
boasts
is
altogether
frivolous
he
maintains
that
man
was
created
in
the
image
of
god
because
he
was
formed
in
the
similitude
of
the
future
messiah
that
he
might
resemble
him
whom
the
father
had
already
decreed
to
clothe
with
flesh
whence
he
concludes
that
if
adam
had
never
fallen
from
his
primitive
integrity
christ
would
nevertheless
have
become
man
how
nugatory
and
forced
this
is
all
who
possess
a
sound
judgment
readily
perceive
but
he
supposes
that
he
has
been
the
first
to
discover
wherein
the
divine
image
consisted
namely
that
the
glory
of
god
not
only
shone
in
those
eminent
talents
with
which
man
was
endued
but
that
god
himself
essentially
resided
in
him
now
though
i
admit
that
adam
bore
the
divine
image
inasmuch
as
he
was
united
to
god
which
is
the
true
and
consummate
perfection
of
dignity
yet
i
contend
that
the
similitude
of
god
is
to
be
sought
only
in
those
characters
of
excellence
with
which
god
distinguished
adam
above
the
other
creatures
and
that
christ
was
even
then
the
image
of
god
is
universally
allowed
and
therefore
whatever
excellence
was
impressed
on
adam
proceeded
from
this
circumstance
that
he
approached
to
the
glory
of
his
maker
by
means
of
his
only
begotten
son
man
therefore
was
made
in
the
image
of
god
and
was
designed
to
be
a
mirror
to
display
the
glory
of
his
creator
he
was
exalted
to
this
degree
of
honour
by
the
favour
of
the
only
begotten
son
but
i
add
that
this
son
was
a
common
head
to
angels
as
well
as
to
men
so
that
the
angels
also
were
entitled
to
the
same
dignity
which
was
conferred
on
man
and
when
we
hear
them
called
the
children
of
god
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
deny
that
they
have
some
resemblance
to
their
father
but
if
he
designed
his
glory
to
be
represented
in
angels
as
well
as
in
men
and
to
be
equally
conspicuous
in
the
angelic
as
in
the
human
nature
osiander
betrays
his
ignorance
and
folly
in
saying
that
men
were
preferred
to
angels
because
the
latter
did
not
bear
the
image
of
christ
for
they
could
not
constantly
enjoy
the
present
contemplation
of
god
unless
they
were
like
him
and
paul
teaches
us
that
men
are
no
otherwise
renewed
after
the
image
of
god
than
that
if
they
be
associated
with
angels
they
may
be
united
together
under
one
head
finally
if
we
give
credit
to
christ
our
ultimate
felicity
when
we
shall
be
received
into
heaven
will
consist
in
being
conformed
to
the
angels
but
if
osiander
may
infer
that
the
primary
exemplar
of
the
divine
image
was
taken
from
the
human
nature
of
christ
with
the
same
justice
may
any
other
person
contend
that
christ
must
have
been
a
partaker
of
the
nature
of
angels
because
they
likewise
possess
the
image
of
god
vii
osiander
then
has
no
reason
to
fear
that
god
might
possibly
be
proved
a
liar
unless
the
decree
concerning
the
incarnation
of
his
son
had
been
previously
and
immutably
fixed
in
his
mind
because
though
adam
had
not
fallen
from
his
integrity
yet
he
would
have
resembled
god
just
as
the
angels
do
and
yet
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
on
that
account
for
the
son
of
god
to
become
either
a
man
or
an
angel
nor
has
he
any
cause
to
fear
this
absurdity
that
if
god
had
not
immutably
decreed
before
the
creation
of
man
that
christ
should
be
born
not
as
a
redeemer
but
as
the
first
man
he
might
lose
his
prerogative
whereas
now
he
would
not
have
become
incarnate
but
for
an
accidental
cause
that
is
to
restore
mankind
from
ruin
so
that
he
might
thence
infer
that
christ
was
created
after
the
image
of
adam
for
why
should
he
dread
what
the
scripture
so
plainly
teaches
that
he
was
made
like
us
in
all
things
sin
excepted
whence
also
luke
hesitates
not
in
his
genealogy
to
call
him
the
son
of
i
would
also
wish
to
know
why
paul
styles
christ
the
second
adam
but
because
he
was
destined
to
become
man
in
order
to
extricate
the
posterity
of
adam
from
ruin
if
he
sustained
that
capacity
before
the
creation
he
ought
to
have
been
called
the
first
osiander
boldly
affirms
that
because
christ
was
already
foreknown
as
man
in
the
divine
mind
therefore
men
were
formed
in
his
likeness
but
paul
by
denominating
him
the
second
adam
places
the
fall
whence
arises
the
necessity
of
restoring
our
nature
to
its
primitive
condition
in
an
intermediate
point
between
the
first
original
of
mankind
and
the
restitution
which
we
obtain
through
christ
whence
it
follows
that
the
fall
was
the
cause
of
the
incarnation
of
the
son
of
god
now
osiander
argues
unreasonably
and
impertinently
that
while
adam
retained
his
integrity
he
would
be
the
image
of
himself
and
not
of
christ
on
the
contrary
i
reply
that
although
the
son
of
god
had
never
been
incarnate
both
the
body
and
the
soul
of
man
would
equally
have
displayed
the
image
of
god
in
whose
radiance
it
always
appeared
that
christ
was
truly
the
head
possessing
the
supremacy
over
all
and
thus
we
destroy
that
futile
subtilty
raised
by
osiander
that
the
angels
would
have
been
destitute
of
this
head
unless
god
had
decreed
to
clothe
his
son
with
flesh
even
without
any
transgression
of
adam
for
he
too
inconsiderately
takes
for
granted
what
no
wise
man
will
concede
that
christ
has
no
supremacy
over
angels
and
that
he
is
not
their
prince
except
in
his
human
nature
but
we
may
easily
conclude
from
the
language
of
paul
that
as
the
eternal
word
of
god
he
is
the
of
every
creature
not
that
he
was
created
or
ought
to
be
numbered
among
creatures
but
because
the
holy
state
of
the
world
adorned
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
with
consummate
beauty
had
no
other
author
and
that
afterwards
as
man
he
was
the
first
begotten
from
the
for
in
one
short
passage
he
proposes
to
our
consideration
both
these
all
things
were
created
by
the
son
that
he
might
have
dominion
over
angels
and
that
he
was
made
man
that
he
might
become
our
redeemer
another
proof
of
osiander
s
ignorance
is
his
assertion
that
men
would
not
have
had
christ
for
their
king
if
he
had
not
been
incarnate
as
though
the
kingdom
of
god
could
not
subsist
if
the
eternal
son
of
god
without
being
invested
with
humanity
uniting
angels
and
men
in
the
participation
of
his
glorious
life
had
himself
held
the
supreme
dominion
but
he
is
always
deceived
or
rather
bewilders
himself
in
this
false
principle
that
the
church
would
have
been
destitute
of
a
head
if
christ
had
not
been
manifested
in
the
flesh
as
if
while
he
was
head
over
angels
he
could
not
likewise
by
his
divine
power
preside
over
men
and
by
the
secret
energy
of
his
spirit
animate
and
support
them
like
his
own
body
till
they
should
be
exalted
to
heaven
and
enjoy
the
life
of
angels
these
impertinencies
which
i
have
thus
far
refuted
osiander
esteems
as
incontrovertible
oracles
inebriated
by
the
charms
of
his
own
speculations
he
is
accustomed
to
express
himself
in
the
language
of
ridiculous
triumph
without
any
sufficient
cause
but
he
quotes
one
passage
more
which
he
asserts
to
be
conclusive
beyond
all
the
rest
that
is
the
prophecy
of
adam
who
when
he
saw
his
wife
said
this
is
now
bone
of
my
bone
and
flesh
of
my
but
how
does
he
prove
this
to
be
a
prophecy
because
christ
according
to
matthew
attributes
the
same
language
to
god
as
though
every
thing
that
god
has
spoken
by
men
contained
some
prophecy
then
osiander
may
seek
for
prophecies
in
each
of
the
precepts
of
the
law
of
which
it
is
evident
god
was
the
author
besides
christ
would
have
been
a
low
and
grovelling
expositor
if
he
had
confined
himself
to
the
literal
sense
because
he
is
treating
not
of
the
mystical
union
with
which
he
has
honoured
his
church
but
only
of
conjugal
fidelity
he
informs
us
that
god
had
pronounced
a
husband
and
wife
to
be
one
flesh
that
no
one
might
attempt
by
a
divorce
to
violate
that
indissoluble
bond
if
osiander
be
displeased
with
this
simplicity
let
him
censure
christ
because
he
did
not
conduct
his
disciples
to
a
mystery
by
a
more
subtile
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
father
nor
does
his
delirious
imagination
obtain
any
support
from
paul
who
after
having
said
that
we
are
members
of
christ
s
flesh
immediately
adds
this
is
a
great
for
the
apostle
s
design
was
not
to
explain
the
sense
in
which
adam
spoke
but
under
the
figure
and
similitude
of
marriage
to
display
the
sacred
union
which
makes
us
one
with
christ
and
this
is
implied
in
his
very
words
for
when
he
apprizes
us
that
he
is
speaking
of
christ
and
the
church
he
introduces
a
kind
of
correction
to
distinguish
between
the
law
of
marriage
and
the
spiritual
union
of
christ
and
the
church
wherefore
this
futile
notion
appears
destitute
of
any
solid
foundation
nor
do
i
think
there
will
be
any
necessity
for
me
to
discuss
similar
subtilties
since
the
vanity
of
them
all
will
be
discovered
from
the
foregoing
very
brief
refutation
but
this
sober
declaration
will
be
amply
sufficient
for
the
solid
satisfaction
of
the
children
of
god
that
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
chapter
xiii
christ
s
assumption
of
real
humanity
the
arguments
for
the
divinity
of
christ
which
has
already
been
proved
by
clear
and
irrefragable
testimonies
it
would
i
conceive
be
unnecessary
to
reiterate
it
remains
then
for
us
to
examine
how
after
having
been
invested
with
our
flesh
he
has
performed
the
office
of
a
mediator
now
the
reality
of
his
humanity
was
anciently
opposed
by
the
manichæans
and
by
the
marcionites
of
whom
the
latter
imagined
to
themselves
a
visionary
phantom
instead
of
the
body
of
christ
and
the
former
dreamed
that
he
had
a
celestial
body
but
both
these
notions
are
contrary
to
numerous
and
powerful
testimonies
of
scripture
for
the
blessing
is
promised
neither
in
a
heavenly
seed
nor
in
a
phantom
of
a
man
but
in
the
seed
of
abraham
and
jacob
nor
is
the
eternal
throne
promised
to
an
aërial
man
but
to
the
son
of
david
and
the
fruit
of
his
loins
wherefore
on
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
he
is
called
the
son
of
david
and
of
abraham
not
because
he
was
merely
born
of
the
virgin
after
having
been
formed
of
some
aërial
substance
but
because
according
to
paul
he
was
made
of
the
seed
of
david
according
to
the
flesh
as
the
same
apostle
in
another
place
informs
us
that
according
to
the
flesh
he
descended
from
the
jews
wherefore
the
lord
himself
not
content
with
the
appellation
of
frequently
calls
himself
also
son
of
term
which
he
intended
as
a
more
express
declaration
of
his
real
humanity
as
the
holy
spirit
has
on
so
many
occasions
by
so
many
instruments
and
with
such
great
diligence
and
simplicity
declared
a
fact
by
no
means
abstruse
in
itself
who
could
have
supposed
that
any
mortals
would
have
such
consummate
impudence
as
to
dare
to
obscure
it
with
subtilties
but
more
testimonies
offer
themselves
if
we
wished
to
multiply
them
such
as
this
of
paul
that
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
and
innumerable
others
from
which
he
appears
to
have
been
liable
to
hunger
thirst
cold
and
other
infirmities
of
our
nature
but
from
the
multitude
we
must
chiefly
select
those
which
may
conduce
to
the
edification
of
our
minds
in
true
faith
as
when
it
is
said
that
he
took
not
on
him
the
nature
of
angels
but
he
took
on
him
the
seed
of
abraham
that
he
took
flesh
and
blood
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
brethren
that
in
all
things
it
behoved
him
to
be
made
like
unto
his
brethren
that
he
might
be
a
merciful
and
faithful
high
priest
that
we
have
not
a
high
priest
which
can
not
be
touched
with
the
feeling
of
our
infirmities
and
the
like
to
the
same
purpose
is
what
we
have
just
before
mentioned
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
sins
of
the
world
to
be
expiated
in
our
flesh
which
is
clearly
asserted
by
paul
and
certainly
all
that
the
father
has
conferred
on
christ
belongs
to
us
because
he
is
the
head
from
whom
the
whole
body
is
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
joint
there
will
otherwise
be
no
propriety
in
the
declaration
that
god
giveth
the
spirit
not
by
measure
unto
him
that
we
may
all
receive
of
his
fulness
since
nothing
would
be
more
absurd
than
that
god
should
be
enriched
in
his
essence
by
any
adventitious
gift
for
this
reason
also
christ
himself
says
in
another
place
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
ii
the
passages
which
they
adduce
in
confirmation
of
this
error
they
most
foolishly
pervert
nor
do
their
frivolous
subtilties
at
all
avail
them
in
their
endeavours
to
obviate
the
arguments
which
i
have
advanced
in
defence
of
our
sentiments
marcion
imagines
that
christ
invested
himself
with
a
phantom
instead
of
a
real
body
because
he
is
said
to
have
been
made
in
the
likeness
of
men
and
to
have
been
found
in
fashion
as
a
but
in
drawing
this
conclusion
he
totally
overlooks
the
scope
of
paul
in
that
passage
for
his
design
is
not
to
describe
the
nature
of
the
body
which
christ
assumed
but
to
assert
that
whilst
he
might
have
displayed
his
divinity
he
manifested
himself
in
the
condition
of
an
abject
and
despised
man
for
to
exhort
us
to
humility
by
the
example
of
christ
he
shows
that
being
god
he
might
have
instantaneously
made
a
conspicuous
exhibition
of
his
glory
to
the
world
yet
that
he
receded
from
his
right
and
voluntarily
debased
himself
for
that
he
assumed
the
form
of
a
servant
and
content
with
that
humble
station
suffered
his
divinity
to
be
hidden
behind
the
veil
of
humanity
the
subject
of
this
statement
without
doubt
is
not
the
nature
of
christ
but
his
conduct
from
the
whole
context
also
it
is
easy
to
infer
that
christ
humbled
himself
by
the
assumption
of
a
real
human
nature
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
clause
that
he
was
found
in
fashion
as
a
man
but
that
for
a
time
his
divine
glory
was
invisible
and
nothing
appeared
but
the
human
form
in
a
mean
and
abject
condition
for
otherwise
there
would
be
no
foundation
for
this
assertion
of
peter
that
he
was
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
quickened
by
the
spirit
if
the
son
of
god
had
not
been
subject
to
the
infirmities
of
human
nature
this
is
more
plainly
expressed
by
paul
when
he
says
that
he
was
crucified
through
the
same
is
confirmed
by
his
exaltation
because
he
is
positively
asserted
to
have
obtained
a
new
glory
after
his
humiliation
which
could
only
be
applicable
to
a
real
man
composed
of
body
and
soul
manichæus
fabricates
for
christ
an
aërial
body
because
he
is
called
the
second
adam
the
lord
from
but
the
apostle
in
that
place
is
not
speaking
of
a
celestial
corporeal
essence
but
of
a
spiritual
energy
which
being
diffused
from
christ
raises
us
into
life
that
energy
we
have
already
seen
that
peter
and
paul
distinguish
from
his
body
the
orthodox
doctrine
therefore
concerning
the
body
of
christ
is
firmly
established
by
this
very
passage
for
unless
christ
had
the
same
corporeal
nature
with
us
there
would
be
no
force
in
the
argument
which
paul
so
vehemently
urges
that
if
christ
be
risen
from
the
dead
then
we
also
shall
rise
that
if
we
rise
not
neither
is
christ
risen
of
whatever
cavils
either
the
ancient
manichæans
or
their
modern
disciples
endeavour
to
avail
themselves
they
can
not
succeed
their
nugatory
pretence
that
christ
is
called
the
son
of
man
because
he
was
promised
to
men
is
a
vain
subterfuge
for
it
is
evident
that
in
the
hebrew
idiom
son
of
is
a
phrase
expressive
of
a
real
man
and
christ
undoubtedly
retained
the
phraseology
of
his
own
language
there
is
no
room
for
disputing
what
is
meant
by
sons
of
and
not
to
go
any
further
it
will
be
fully
sufficient
to
quote
a
passage
in
the
eighth
psalm
which
the
apostles
apply
to
christ
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
or
the
son
of
man
that
thou
visitest
him
this
phrase
expresses
the
true
humanity
of
christ
because
though
he
was
not
immediately
begotten
by
a
mortal
father
yet
his
descent
was
derived
from
adam
nor
would
there
otherwise
be
any
truth
in
what
we
have
just
quoted
that
christ
became
a
partaker
of
flesh
and
blood
that
he
might
bring
many
sons
to
which
clearly
styles
him
to
be
a
partaker
of
the
same
common
nature
with
us
in
the
same
sense
the
apostle
says
that
both
he
that
sanctifieth
and
they
who
are
sanctified
are
all
of
for
the
context
proves
that
this
refers
to
a
community
of
nature
because
he
immediately
adds
for
which
cause
he
is
not
ashamed
to
call
them
for
if
he
had
already
said
that
the
faithful
are
of
god
what
reason
could
jesus
christ
have
to
be
ashamed
of
such
great
dignity
but
because
christ
of
his
infinite
grace
associates
himself
with
those
who
are
vile
and
contemptible
it
is
therefore
said
that
he
is
not
ashamed
it
is
a
vain
objection
which
they
make
that
on
this
principle
the
impious
will
become
the
brethren
of
christ
because
we
know
that
the
children
of
god
are
born
not
of
flesh
and
blood
but
of
the
spirit
through
faith
therefore
a
community
of
nature
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
constitute
a
fraternal
union
but
though
it
is
only
to
the
faithful
that
the
apostle
assigns
the
honour
of
being
one
with
christ
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
unbelievers
are
not
according
to
the
flesh
born
of
the
same
original
as
when
we
say
that
christ
was
made
man
to
make
us
children
of
god
this
expression
extends
not
to
all
men
because
faith
is
the
medium
by
which
we
are
spiritually
ingrafted
into
the
body
of
christ
they
likewise
raise
a
foolish
contention
respecting
the
appellation
of
they
plead
that
christ
ought
to
have
been
born
at
the
beginning
immediately
of
adam
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
among
many
but
the
primogeniture
attributed
to
him
refers
not
to
age
but
to
the
degree
of
honour
and
the
eminence
of
power
which
he
enjoys
nor
is
there
any
more
plausibility
in
their
notion
that
christ
is
said
to
have
assumed
the
nature
of
man
and
not
of
angels
because
he
received
the
human
race
into
his
favour
for
the
apostle
to
magnify
the
honour
with
which
christ
has
favoured
us
compares
us
with
the
angels
before
whom
in
this
respect
we
are
preferred
and
if
the
testimony
of
moses
be
duly
considered
where
he
says
that
the
seed
of
the
woman
shall
bruise
the
head
of
the
serpent
it
will
decide
the
whole
controversy
for
that
prediction
relates
not
to
christ
alone
but
to
the
whole
human
race
because
the
victory
was
to
be
gained
for
us
by
christ
god
pronounces
in
general
that
the
posterity
of
the
woman
should
be
superior
to
the
devil
whence
it
follows
that
christ
descended
from
the
human
race
because
the
design
of
god
in
that
promise
to
eve
was
to
comfort
her
with
a
good
hope
that
she
might
not
be
overcome
with
sorrow
iii
those
passages
where
christ
is
called
the
seed
of
abraham
and
the
fruit
of
the
body
of
david
they
with
equal
folly
and
wickedness
involve
in
allegories
for
if
the
word
had
been
used
in
an
allegorical
sense
paul
certainly
would
not
have
been
silent
respecting
it
where
without
any
figure
he
explicitly
affirms
that
there
are
not
many
sons
of
abraham
who
are
redeemers
but
christ
alone
equally
unfounded
is
their
notion
that
christ
is
called
the
son
of
david
in
no
other
sense
but
because
he
had
been
promised
and
was
at
length
manifested
in
due
time
for
after
paul
has
declared
him
to
have
been
made
of
the
seed
of
david
the
immediate
addition
of
this
phrase
according
to
the
flesh
is
certainly
a
designation
of
nature
thus
also
in
another
place
he
calls
him
god
blessed
for
ever
and
distinctly
states
that
he
descended
from
the
jews
as
concerning
the
now
if
he
was
not
really
begotten
of
the
seed
of
david
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
expression
the
fruit
of
his
loins
what
becomes
of
this
promise
of
the
fruit
of
thy
body
will
i
set
upon
thy
throne
they
likewise
trifle
in
a
sophistical
manner
with
the
genealogy
of
christ
as
it
is
given
by
matthew
for
though
he
mentions
the
parents
of
joseph
and
not
of
mary
yet
as
he
was
treating
of
a
thing
then
generally
known
he
thought
it
sufficient
to
show
that
joseph
descended
from
the
seed
of
david
while
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
mary
was
of
the
same
family
but
luke
goes
further
with
a
view
to
signify
that
the
salvation
procured
by
christ
is
common
to
all
mankind
since
christ
the
author
of
salvation
is
descended
from
adam
the
common
parent
of
all
i
grant
indeed
that
from
the
genealogy
it
can
not
be
inferred
that
christ
is
the
son
of
david
any
otherwise
than
as
he
was
born
of
the
virgin
but
the
modern
marcionites
to
give
a
plausibility
to
their
error
that
christ
derived
his
body
from
nothing
contend
that
women
have
no
generative
semen
and
thus
they
subvert
the
elements
of
nature
but
as
this
is
not
a
theological
question
and
the
arguments
which
they
adduce
are
so
futile
that
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
repelling
them
i
shall
not
meddle
with
points
belonging
to
philosophy
and
the
medical
art
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
obviate
the
objection
which
they
allege
from
the
scripture
namely
that
aaron
and
jehoiada
married
wives
of
the
tribe
of
judah
and
thus
if
women
contain
generative
semen
the
distinction
of
tribes
was
confounded
but
it
is
sufficiently
known
that
for
the
purposes
of
political
regulation
the
posterity
is
always
reckoned
from
the
father
yet
that
the
superiority
of
the
male
sex
forms
no
objection
to
the
coöperation
of
the
female
semen
in
the
process
of
generation
this
solution
extends
to
all
the
genealogies
frequently
when
the
scripture
exhibits
a
catalogue
of
names
it
mentions
none
but
men
is
it
therefore
to
be
concluded
that
women
are
nothing
even
children
themselves
know
that
women
are
comprehended
under
their
husbands
for
this
reason
women
are
said
to
bear
children
to
their
husbands
because
the
name
of
the
family
always
remains
with
the
males
now
as
it
is
a
privilege
conceded
to
the
superiority
of
the
male
sex
that
children
should
be
accounted
noble
or
ignoble
according
to
the
condition
of
their
fathers
so
on
the
other
hand
it
is
held
by
the
lawyers
that
in
a
state
of
slavery
the
offspring
follows
the
condition
of
the
mother
whence
we
may
infer
that
the
offspring
is
produced
partly
from
the
seed
of
the
mother
and
the
common
language
of
all
nations
implies
that
mothers
have
some
share
in
the
generation
of
children
this
is
in
harmony
with
the
divine
law
which
otherwise
would
have
no
ground
for
the
prohibition
of
the
marriage
of
an
uncle
with
his
sister
s
daughter
because
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
consanguinity
it
would
also
be
lawful
for
a
man
to
marry
his
uterine
sister
provided
she
were
begotten
by
another
father
but
while
i
grant
that
a
passive
power
is
ascribed
to
women
i
also
maintain
that
the
same
that
is
affirmed
of
men
is
indiscriminately
predicated
of
them
nor
is
christ
himself
said
to
be
made
by
a
woman
but
of
a
some
of
these
persons
casting
off
all
modesty
impudently
inquire
whether
we
choose
to
say
that
christ
was
procreated
from
the
menstrual
seed
of
the
virgin
i
will
inquire
on
the
other
hand
whether
he
was
not
united
with
the
blood
of
his
mother
and
this
they
must
be
constrained
to
confess
it
is
properly
inferred
therefore
from
the
language
of
matthew
that
inasmuch
as
christ
was
begotten
of
mary
he
was
procreated
from
her
seed
as
when
booz
is
said
to
have
been
begotten
of
rahab
it
denotes
a
similar
generation
nor
is
it
the
design
of
matthew
here
to
describe
the
virgin
as
a
tube
through
which
christ
passed
but
to
discriminate
this
miraculous
conception
from
ordinary
generation
in
that
jesus
christ
was
generated
of
the
seed
of
david
by
means
of
a
virgin
in
the
same
sense
and
for
the
same
reason
that
isaac
is
said
to
have
been
begotten
of
abraham
solomon
of
david
and
joseph
of
jacob
so
christ
is
said
to
have
been
begotten
of
his
mother
for
the
evangelist
has
written
the
whole
of
his
account
upon
this
principle
and
to
prove
that
christ
descended
from
david
he
has
contented
himself
with
this
one
fact
that
he
was
begotten
of
mary
whence
it
follows
that
he
took
for
granted
the
consanguinity
of
mary
and
joseph
iv
the
absurdities
with
which
these
opponents
wish
to
press
us
are
replete
with
puerile
cavils
they
esteem
it
mean
and
dishonourable
to
christ
that
he
should
derive
his
descent
from
men
because
he
could
not
be
exempt
from
the
universal
law
which
concludes
all
the
posterity
of
adam
without
exception
under
sin
but
the
antithesis
which
we
find
in
paul
easily
solves
this
difficulty
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
death
by
sin
even
so
by
the
righteousness
of
one
the
grace
of
god
hath
to
this
the
following
passage
corresponds
the
first
man
is
of
the
earth
earthy
the
second
man
is
the
lord
from
therefore
the
same
apostle
in
another
place
by
teaching
us
that
christ
was
sent
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
to
satisfy
the
law
expressly
distinguishes
him
from
the
common
condition
of
mankind
so
that
he
is
a
real
man
and
yet
free
from
all
fault
and
corruption
they
betray
their
ignorance
in
arguing
that
if
christ
is
perfectly
immaculate
and
was
begotten
of
the
seed
of
mary
by
the
secret
operation
of
the
spirit
then
it
follows
that
there
is
no
impurity
in
the
seed
of
women
but
only
in
that
of
men
for
we
do
not
represent
christ
as
perfectly
immaculate
merely
because
he
was
born
of
the
seed
of
a
woman
unconnected
with
any
man
but
because
he
was
sanctified
by
the
spirit
so
that
his
generation
was
pure
and
holy
such
as
it
would
have
been
before
the
fall
of
adam
and
it
is
a
fixed
maxim
with
us
that
whenever
the
scripture
mentions
the
purity
of
christ
it
relates
to
a
real
humanity
because
to
assert
the
purity
of
deity
would
be
quite
unnecessary
the
sanctification
also
of
which
he
speaks
in
the
seventeenth
chapter
of
john
could
have
no
reference
to
the
divine
nature
nor
do
we
as
they
pretend
imagine
two
kinds
of
seed
in
adam
notwithstanding
christ
was
free
from
all
contagion
for
the
generation
of
man
is
not
naturally
and
originally
impure
and
corrupt
but
only
accidentally
so
in
consequence
of
the
fall
therefore
we
need
not
wonder
that
christ
who
was
to
restore
our
integrity
was
exempted
from
the
general
corruption
but
what
they
urge
on
us
as
an
absurdity
that
if
the
word
of
god
was
clothed
with
flesh
it
was
therefore
confined
within
the
narrow
prison
of
an
earthly
body
is
mere
impudence
because
although
the
infinite
essence
of
the
word
is
united
in
one
person
with
the
nature
of
man
yet
we
have
no
idea
of
its
incarceration
or
confinement
for
the
son
of
god
miraculously
descended
from
heaven
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
he
never
left
heaven
he
chose
to
be
miraculously
conceived
in
the
womb
of
the
virgin
to
live
on
the
earth
and
to
be
suspended
on
the
cross
and
yet
he
never
ceased
to
fill
the
universe
in
the
same
manner
as
from
the
beginning
chapter
xiv
the
union
of
the
two
natures
constituting
the
person
of
the
mediator
when
it
is
said
that
the
word
was
made
flesh
this
is
not
to
be
understood
as
if
the
word
was
transmuted
into
flesh
or
blended
with
flesh
choosing
from
the
womb
of
the
virgin
a
temple
for
his
residence
he
who
was
the
son
of
god
became
also
the
son
of
man
not
by
a
confusion
of
substance
but
by
a
unity
of
person
for
we
assert
such
a
connection
and
union
of
the
divinity
with
the
humanity
that
each
nature
retains
its
properties
entire
and
yet
both
together
constitute
one
christ
if
any
thing
among
men
can
be
found
to
resemble
so
great
a
mystery
man
himself
appears
to
furnish
the
most
apposite
similitude
being
evidently
composed
of
two
substances
of
which
however
neither
is
so
confounded
with
the
other
as
not
to
retain
its
distinct
nature
for
the
soul
is
not
the
body
nor
is
the
body
the
soul
wherefore
that
is
predicated
separately
of
the
soul
which
can
not
be
at
all
applied
to
the
body
on
the
contrary
that
is
predicated
of
the
body
which
is
totally
incompatible
with
the
soul
and
that
is
predicated
of
the
whole
man
which
can
not
with
propriety
be
understood
either
of
the
soul
or
of
the
body
alone
lastly
the
properties
of
the
soul
are
transferred
to
the
body
and
the
properties
of
the
body
to
the
soul
yet
he
that
is
composed
of
these
two
parts
is
no
more
than
one
man
such
forms
of
expression
signify
that
there
is
in
man
one
person
composed
of
two
distinct
parts
and
that
there
are
two
different
natures
united
in
him
to
constitute
that
one
person
the
scriptures
speak
in
a
similar
manner
respecting
christ
they
attribute
to
him
sometimes
those
things
which
are
applicable
merely
to
his
humanity
sometimes
those
things
which
belong
peculiarly
to
his
divinity
and
not
unfrequently
those
things
which
comprehend
both
his
natures
but
are
incompatible
with
either
of
them
alone
and
this
union
of
the
two
natures
in
christ
they
so
carefully
maintain
that
they
sometimes
attribute
to
one
what
belongs
to
the
mode
of
expression
which
the
ancient
writers
called
a
communication
of
properties
ii
these
things
might
be
liable
to
objection
if
the
scripture
did
not
abound
with
passages
which
prove
that
none
of
them
is
of
human
invention
what
christ
asserted
concerning
himself
before
abraham
was
i
am
was
very
inapplicable
to
his
humanity
i
am
aware
of
the
cavil
with
which
erroneous
spirits
would
corrupt
this
passage
he
was
before
all
ages
because
he
was
even
then
foreknown
as
the
redeemer
as
well
in
the
decree
of
the
father
as
in
the
minds
of
the
faithful
but
as
he
clearly
distinguishes
the
day
of
his
manifestation
from
his
eternal
essence
and
professedly
urges
his
antiquity
in
proof
of
his
possessing
an
authority
in
which
he
excels
abraham
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
challenges
to
himself
what
is
peculiar
to
the
deity
paul
asserts
him
to
be
the
born
of
every
creature
that
he
is
before
all
things
and
that
by
him
all
things
consist
he
declares
himself
that
he
had
a
glory
with
the
father
before
the
world
was
and
that
he
coöperates
with
the
father
these
things
are
equally
incompatible
with
humanity
it
is
certain
that
these
and
such
as
these
are
peculiar
attributes
of
divinity
but
when
he
is
called
the
servant
of
the
father
when
it
is
stated
that
he
increased
in
wisdom
and
stature
and
in
favour
with
god
and
man
that
he
seeks
not
his
own
glory
that
he
knows
not
the
last
day
that
he
speaks
not
of
himself
that
he
does
not
his
own
will
that
he
was
seen
and
handled
all
this
belongs
solely
to
his
humanity
for
as
he
is
god
he
is
incapable
of
any
augmentation
whatever
he
does
all
things
for
his
own
glory
and
there
is
nothing
concealed
from
him
he
does
all
things
according
to
the
decision
of
his
own
will
and
is
invisible
and
intangible
and
yet
he
ascribes
these
things
not
to
his
human
nature
separately
but
to
himself
as
though
they
belonged
to
the
person
of
the
mediator
but
the
communication
of
properties
is
exemplified
in
the
assertion
of
paul
that
god
purchased
the
church
with
his
own
blood
and
that
the
lord
of
glory
was
also
in
what
john
says
that
they
had
handled
the
word
of
god
has
no
blood
he
is
not
capable
of
suffering
or
of
being
touched
with
hands
but
since
he
who
was
at
once
the
true
god
and
the
man
christ
jesus
was
crucified
and
shed
his
blood
for
us
those
things
which
were
performed
in
his
human
nature
are
improperly
yet
not
without
reason
transferred
to
the
divinity
there
is
a
similar
example
of
this
where
john
teaches
us
that
god
laid
down
his
life
for
there
also
the
property
of
the
humanity
is
transferred
to
the
other
nature
again
when
christ
while
he
still
lived
on
the
earth
said
no
man
hath
ascended
up
to
heaven
but
he
that
came
down
from
heaven
even
the
son
of
man
which
is
in
heaven
as
man
and
in
the
body
which
he
had
assumed
he
certainly
was
not
at
that
time
in
heaven
but
because
he
was
both
god
and
man
on
account
of
the
union
of
both
natures
he
attributed
to
one
what
belonged
to
the
other
iii
but
the
clearest
of
all
the
passages
declarative
of
the
true
substance
of
christ
are
those
which
comprehend
both
the
natures
together
such
as
abound
in
the
gospel
of
john
for
it
is
not
with
exclusive
reference
to
the
deity
or
the
humanity
but
respecting
the
complex
person
composed
of
both
that
we
find
it
there
stated
that
he
has
received
of
the
father
power
to
forgive
sins
to
raise
up
whom
he
will
to
bestow
righteousness
holiness
and
salvation
that
he
is
appointed
to
be
the
judge
of
the
living
and
the
dead
that
he
may
receive
the
same
honour
as
the
father
finally
that
he
is
the
light
of
the
world
the
good
shepherd
the
only
door
the
true
for
with
such
prerogatives
was
the
son
of
god
invested
at
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
which
although
he
enjoyed
with
the
father
before
the
creation
of
the
world
yet
not
in
the
same
manner
or
on
the
same
account
and
which
could
not
be
conferred
on
a
mere
man
in
the
same
sense
also
it
is
reasonable
to
understand
the
declaration
of
paul
that
after
the
last
judgment
christ
shall
deliver
up
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
now
the
kingdom
of
the
son
of
god
which
had
no
beginning
will
never
have
any
end
but
as
he
concealed
himself
under
the
meanness
of
the
flesh
and
humbled
himself
by
assuming
the
form
of
a
servant
and
laid
aside
his
external
majesty
in
obedience
to
the
father
and
after
having
undergone
this
humiliation
was
at
length
crowned
with
glory
and
honour
and
exalted
to
supreme
dominion
that
before
him
every
knee
should
bow
so
he
shall
then
surrender
to
the
father
that
name
and
crown
of
glory
and
all
that
he
has
received
from
the
father
that
god
may
be
all
in
for
why
has
power
and
dominion
been
given
to
him
but
that
the
father
may
rule
us
by
his
hand
in
this
sense
he
is
also
said
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
but
this
is
only
temporary
till
we
can
enjoy
the
immediate
contemplation
of
the
deity
and
here
it
is
impossible
to
excuse
the
error
of
the
ancients
who
for
want
of
sufficient
attention
to
the
person
of
the
mediator
obscure
the
genuine
sense
of
almost
all
the
doctrine
which
we
have
in
the
gospel
of
john
and
involve
themselves
in
many
difficulties
let
this
maxim
then
serve
us
as
a
key
to
the
true
sense
that
those
things
which
relate
to
the
office
of
the
mediator
are
not
spoken
simply
of
his
divine
or
of
his
human
nature
christ
therefore
will
reign
till
he
comes
to
judge
the
world
forasmuch
as
he
connects
us
with
the
father
as
far
as
is
compatible
with
our
infirmity
but
when
we
shall
participate
the
glory
of
heaven
and
see
god
as
he
is
then
having
fulfilled
the
office
of
mediator
he
will
cease
to
be
the
ambassador
of
the
father
and
will
be
content
with
that
glory
which
he
enjoyed
before
the
creation
of
the
world
nor
is
the
title
of
lord
peculiarly
applied
to
the
person
of
christ
in
any
other
respect
than
as
it
marks
an
intermediate
station
between
god
and
us
this
is
the
meaning
of
that
expression
of
paul
one
god
of
whom
are
all
things
and
one
lord
by
whom
are
all
things
namely
to
whom
the
father
has
committed
a
temporary
dominion
till
we
shall
be
admitted
to
the
immediate
presence
of
his
divine
majesty
which
will
be
so
far
from
sustaining
any
diminution
by
his
surrender
of
the
kingdom
to
the
father
that
it
will
exhibit
itself
in
far
superior
splendour
for
then
also
god
will
cease
to
be
the
head
of
christ
because
the
deity
of
christ
himself
which
is
still
covered
with
a
veil
will
shine
forth
in
all
its
native
effulgence
iv
and
this
observation
if
the
reader
make
a
judicious
application
of
it
will
be
of
great
use
towards
the
solution
of
many
difficulties
for
it
is
surprising
how
much
ignorant
persons
and
even
some
who
are
not
altogether
destitute
of
learning
are
perplexed
by
such
forms
of
expression
as
they
find
attributed
to
christ
which
are
not
exactly
appropriate
either
to
his
divinity
or
to
his
humanity
this
is
for
want
of
considering
that
they
are
applicable
to
his
complex
person
consisting
of
god
and
man
and
to
his
office
of
mediator
and
indeed
we
may
see
the
most
beautiful
coherence
between
all
these
things
if
they
have
only
a
sober
expositor
to
examine
such
great
mysteries
with
becoming
reverence
but
these
furious
and
frantic
spirits
throw
every
thing
into
confusion
they
lay
hold
of
the
properties
of
his
humanity
to
destroy
his
divinity
on
the
other
hand
they
catch
at
the
attributes
of
his
divinity
to
destroy
his
humanity
and
by
what
is
spoken
of
both
natures
united
but
is
applicable
separately
to
neither
they
attempt
to
destroy
both
now
what
is
this
but
to
contend
that
christ
is
not
man
because
he
is
god
that
he
is
not
god
because
he
is
man
and
that
he
is
neither
man
nor
god
because
he
is
at
once
both
man
and
god
we
conclude
therefore
that
christ
as
he
is
god
and
man
composed
of
these
two
natures
united
yet
not
confounded
is
our
lord
and
the
true
son
of
god
even
in
his
humanity
though
not
on
account
of
his
humanity
for
we
ought
carefully
to
avoid
the
error
of
nestorius
who
attempting
rather
to
divide
than
to
distinguish
the
two
natures
thereby
imagined
a
double
christ
this
we
find
clearly
contradicted
by
the
scripture
where
the
appellation
of
the
son
of
god
is
given
to
him
who
was
born
of
the
virgin
and
the
virgin
herself
is
called
the
mother
of
our
we
must
also
beware
of
the
error
of
eutyches
lest
while
we
aim
to
establish
the
unity
of
christ
s
person
we
destroy
the
distinction
of
his
two
natures
for
we
have
already
cited
so
many
testimonies
where
his
divinity
is
distinguished
from
his
humanity
and
the
scripture
abounds
with
so
many
others
that
they
may
silence
even
the
most
contentious
i
shall
shortly
subjoin
some
in
order
to
a
more
complete
refutation
of
that
notion
at
present
one
passage
shall
suffice
us
for
christ
would
not
have
styled
his
body
a
temple
if
it
had
not
been
the
residence
of
the
divinity
and
at
the
same
time
distinct
from
it
wherefore
as
nestorius
was
justly
condemned
in
the
council
of
ephesus
so
also
was
eutyches
afterwards
in
the
councils
of
constantinople
and
chalcedon
for
to
confound
the
two
natures
in
christ
and
to
separate
them
are
equally
wrong
but
in
our
time
also
there
has
arisen
a
heretic
equally
pestilent
michael
servetus
who
in
the
place
of
the
son
of
god
has
substituted
an
imaginary
being
composed
of
the
essence
of
god
spirit
flesh
and
three
uncreated
elements
in
the
first
place
he
denies
christ
to
be
the
son
of
god
in
any
other
respect
than
as
he
was
begotten
by
the
holy
spirit
in
the
womb
of
the
virgin
but
his
subtlety
tends
to
subvert
the
distinction
of
the
two
natures
and
thereby
to
represent
christ
as
something
composed
of
god
and
man
and
yet
neither
god
nor
man
for
this
is
the
principal
point
which
he
constantly
endeavours
to
establish
that
before
christ
was
manifested
in
the
flesh
there
were
in
god
only
some
shadowy
figures
the
truth
or
effect
of
which
had
no
real
existence
till
the
word
who
had
been
destined
to
this
honour
actually
began
to
be
the
son
of
god
now
we
confess
that
the
mediator
who
was
born
of
the
virgin
is
properly
the
son
of
god
nor
indeed
could
the
man
christ
be
a
mirror
of
the
inestimable
grace
of
god
if
this
dignity
had
not
been
conferred
on
him
to
be
and
to
be
called
the
only
begotten
son
of
the
doctrine
of
the
church
however
remains
unshaken
that
he
is
accounted
the
son
of
god
because
being
the
word
begotten
by
the
father
before
all
ages
he
assumed
the
human
nature
in
a
hypostatical
union
by
the
hypostatical
union
the
ancients
expressed
the
combination
of
two
natures
constituting
one
person
it
was
invented
to
refute
the
error
of
nestorius
who
imagined
the
son
of
god
to
have
dwelt
in
flesh
in
such
a
manner
as
notwithstanding
that
to
have
had
no
real
humanity
servetus
falsely
accuses
us
of
making
two
sons
of
god
when
we
say
that
the
eternal
word
was
the
son
of
god
before
he
was
clothed
with
flesh
as
though
we
affirmed
any
other
than
that
he
was
manifested
in
the
flesh
for
if
he
was
god
before
he
became
man
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
he
began
to
be
a
new
god
there
is
no
more
absurdity
in
affirming
that
the
son
of
god
appeared
in
the
flesh
who
nevertheless
was
always
the
son
of
god
by
eternal
generation
this
is
implied
in
the
words
of
the
angel
to
mary
that
holy
thing
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
god
as
though
he
had
said
that
the
name
of
the
son
which
had
been
in
obscurity
under
the
law
was
about
to
be
celebrated
and
universally
known
consistent
with
this
is
the
representation
of
paul
that
through
christ
we
are
the
sons
of
god
and
may
freely
and
confidently
cry
abba
father
but
were
not
the
holy
patriarchs
in
ancient
times
numbered
among
the
children
of
god
yes
and
depending
on
this
claim
they
invoked
god
as
their
father
but
because
since
the
introduction
of
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
into
the
world
the
celestial
paternity
has
been
more
clearly
revealed
paul
mentions
this
as
the
privilege
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
it
must
however
be
steadily
maintained
that
god
never
was
a
father
either
to
angels
or
to
men
but
with
reference
to
his
only
begotten
son
and
especially
that
men
whom
their
own
iniquity
renders
odious
to
god
are
his
sons
by
gratuitous
adoption
because
christ
is
his
son
by
nature
nor
is
there
any
force
in
the
cavil
of
servetus
that
this
depends
on
the
filiation
which
god
has
decreed
in
himself
because
we
are
not
here
treating
of
figures
as
expiation
was
represented
by
the
blood
of
the
sacrifices
but
as
they
could
not
be
the
sons
of
god
in
reality
unless
their
adoption
were
founded
on
this
head
it
is
unreasonable
to
detract
from
the
head
that
which
is
common
to
all
the
members
i
go
further
since
the
scripture
calls
angels
the
children
of
god
whose
enjoyment
of
such
high
dignity
depended
not
on
the
future
redemption
yet
it
is
necessary
that
christ
should
precede
them
in
order
seeing
it
is
by
him
that
they
are
connected
with
the
father
i
will
briefly
repeat
this
observation
and
apply
the
same
to
the
human
race
since
angels
and
men
were
originally
created
in
such
a
condition
that
god
was
the
common
father
of
both
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
assertion
of
paul
that
christ
was
before
all
things
the
head
of
the
body
and
the
of
every
creature
that
in
all
things
he
might
have
the
preëminence
i
conceive
i
am
right
in
concluding
that
he
was
also
the
son
of
god
before
the
creation
of
the
world
vi
but
if
his
filiation
so
to
speak
commenced
at
the
time
of
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
it
will
follow
that
he
was
the
son
also
in
respect
of
his
human
nature
servetus
and
other
heretics
maintain
that
christ
who
appeared
in
the
flesh
was
the
son
of
god
because
out
of
the
flesh
he
could
not
be
entitled
to
this
appellation
now
let
them
answer
me
whether
he
be
the
son
according
to
both
natures
and
in
respect
of
both
so
indeed
they
idly
pretend
but
paul
teaches
us
very
differently
we
confess
that
christ
is
called
the
son
in
his
human
nature
not
as
the
faithful
are
merely
by
adoption
and
grace
but
the
true
and
natural
and
therefore
the
only
son
that
by
this
character
he
may
be
distinguished
from
all
others
for
we
who
are
regenerated
to
a
new
life
are
honoured
by
god
with
the
title
of
sons
but
the
appellation
of
his
true
and
only
begotten
son
he
gives
to
christ
alone
but
among
such
a
multitude
of
brethren
how
can
he
be
the
only
son
unless
he
possess
by
nature
what
we
have
received
as
a
gift
and
we
extend
this
honour
to
the
whole
person
of
the
mediator
that
he
who
was
born
of
the
virgin
and
offered
himself
on
the
cross
as
a
victim
to
the
father
is
truly
and
properly
the
son
of
god
but
nevertheless
with
respect
to
his
deity
as
paul
suggests
when
he
says
that
he
was
separated
unto
the
gospel
of
god
which
he
had
promised
afore
concerning
his
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
which
was
made
of
the
seed
of
david
according
to
the
flesh
and
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
with
when
he
distinctly
denominates
him
the
son
of
david
according
to
the
flesh
why
should
he
particularly
say
that
he
was
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
with
power
unless
he
intended
to
suggest
that
this
dignity
depended
not
on
that
flesh
but
on
something
else
for
in
the
same
sense
in
which
he
says
in
another
place
that
he
was
crucified
through
weakness
yet
that
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
god
so
in
this
passage
he
introduces
the
difference
between
the
two
natures
they
certainly
must
be
constrained
to
admit
that
as
he
has
received
of
his
mother
that
which
causes
him
to
be
called
the
son
of
david
so
he
has
from
his
father
that
which
constitutes
him
the
son
of
god
and
that
this
is
something
distinct
and
different
from
his
humanity
the
scripture
distinguishes
him
by
two
names
calling
him
sometimes
the
son
of
god
sometimes
the
son
of
with
respect
to
the
latter
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
he
is
styled
the
son
of
man
in
conformity
to
the
common
idiom
of
the
hebrew
language
because
he
is
one
of
the
posterity
of
adam
i
contend
on
the
other
hand
that
he
is
denominated
the
son
of
god
on
account
of
his
deity
and
eternal
existence
because
it
is
equally
reasonable
that
the
appellation
of
son
of
god
should
be
referred
to
the
divine
nature
as
that
that
of
son
of
man
should
be
referred
to
the
human
nature
in
short
in
the
passage
which
i
have
cited
that
he
who
was
made
of
the
seed
of
david
according
to
the
flesh
was
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
with
power
paul
intends
the
same
as
he
teaches
us
in
another
place
that
christ
who
as
concerning
the
flesh
came
of
the
jews
is
god
blessed
for
but
if
the
distinction
of
the
two
natures
be
expressed
in
both
these
passages
by
what
authority
will
they
deny
that
he
is
the
son
of
god
in
respect
of
his
divine
nature
who
according
to
the
flesh
is
likewise
the
son
of
man
vii
they
clamorously
urge
in
support
of
their
error
that
god
is
said
not
to
have
spared
his
own
son
and
that
the
angel
directed
that
the
very
same
who
was
to
be
born
of
the
virgin
should
be
called
the
son
of
the
but
to
prevent
their
glorying
in
so
futile
an
objection
let
them
accompany
us
in
a
brief
examination
of
the
validity
of
their
reasoning
for
if
it
be
rightly
concluded
that
he
began
to
be
the
son
of
god
at
his
conception
because
he
that
is
conceived
is
called
his
son
it
will
follow
that
he
began
to
be
the
word
at
his
manifestation
in
the
flesh
because
john
tells
us
that
he
declares
that
which
his
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
so
when
they
read
the
following
address
of
the
prophet
thou
bethlehem
ephratah
though
thou
be
little
among
the
thousands
of
judah
yet
out
of
thee
shall
he
come
forth
unto
me
that
is
to
be
ruler
in
israel
whose
goings
forth
have
been
from
of
old
from
everlasting
or
from
the
days
of
eternity
what
interpretation
will
they
be
obliged
to
adopt
if
they
determine
to
pursue
such
a
mode
of
argumentation
for
i
have
declared
that
we
by
no
means
coincide
with
nestorius
who
imagined
two
christs
according
to
our
doctrine
christ
has
made
us
the
sons
of
god
together
with
himself
by
the
privilege
of
a
fraternal
union
because
he
is
in
our
nature
which
he
assumed
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
and
augustine
judiciously
apprizes
us
that
it
is
an
illustrious
mirror
of
the
wonderful
and
singular
grace
of
god
that
jesus
christ
considered
as
man
obtained
honour
which
he
could
not
from
his
very
birth
therefore
was
christ
adorned
even
in
his
human
nature
with
the
dignity
of
being
the
son
of
god
yet
in
the
unity
of
person
we
must
not
imagine
such
a
confusion
as
to
destroy
that
which
is
peculiar
to
deity
for
it
is
no
more
unreasonable
that
the
eternal
word
of
god
and
the
man
christ
jesus
the
two
natures
being
united
into
one
person
should
be
called
the
son
of
god
in
different
senses
than
that
he
should
be
styled
in
various
respects
sometimes
the
son
of
god
sometimes
the
son
of
man
nor
are
we
any
more
embarrassed
with
the
other
cavil
of
servetus
that
before
christ
appeared
in
the
flesh
he
is
no
where
called
the
son
of
god
but
in
a
figurative
sense
for
though
the
description
of
him
then
was
rather
obscure
yet
since
it
has
now
been
clearly
proved
that
he
was
the
eternal
god
no
otherwise
than
as
he
was
the
word
begotten
of
the
eternal
father
and
that
this
name
is
applicable
to
him
in
the
character
of
mediator
which
he
has
assumed
only
because
he
is
god
manifested
in
the
flesh
and
that
god
the
father
would
not
have
been
thus
denominated
from
the
beginning
unless
there
had
even
then
been
a
mutual
relation
to
the
son
who
is
the
source
of
all
kindred
or
paternity
in
heaven
and
in
earth
the
inference
is
clear
that
even
under
the
law
and
the
prophets
he
was
the
son
of
god
before
this
name
was
commonly
used
in
the
church
if
the
contention
be
merely
about
the
word
solomon
in
speaking
of
the
infinite
sublimity
of
god
affirms
his
son
to
be
incomprehensible
as
well
as
himself
what
is
his
name
says
he
and
what
is
his
son
s
name
if
thou
canst
tell
i
am
aware
that
this
testimony
will
not
have
sufficient
weight
with
contentious
persons
nor
indeed
do
i
lay
much
stress
on
it
only
that
it
fixes
the
charge
of
a
malicious
cavil
on
those
who
deny
that
christ
is
the
son
of
god
any
otherwise
than
because
he
has
become
man
it
must
also
be
remarked
that
all
the
most
ancient
writers
have
with
one
accord
so
unequivocally
asserted
the
same
doctrine
that
it
argues
impudence
equally
ridiculous
and
detestable
in
those
who
dare
to
represent
us
as
opposing
irenæus
and
tertullian
who
both
acknowledge
that
jesus
christ
who
at
length
made
a
visible
appearance
was
always
the
invisible
son
of
god
viii
but
although
servetus
has
accumulated
many
horrible
and
monstrous
notions
to
which
some
of
his
brethren
perhaps
would
refuse
to
subscribe
yet
whoever
they
are
that
acknowledge
not
christ
to
be
the
son
of
god
except
in
the
human
nature
if
we
press
them
closely
we
shall
find
that
this
title
is
admitted
by
them
on
no
other
ground
than
because
he
was
conceived
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
womb
of
the
virgin
as
the
manichæans
formerly
pretended
that
man
received
his
soul
by
emanation
from
god
because
it
is
said
that
god
breathed
into
adam
the
breath
of
life
for
they
lay
such
stress
on
the
name
of
son
that
they
leave
no
difference
between
the
two
natures
but
tell
us
in
a
confused
manner
that
christ
is
the
son
of
god
considered
as
man
because
his
human
nature
was
begotten
by
god
thus
the
eternal
generation
of
wisdom
of
which
solomon
speaks
is
destroyed
and
no
notice
is
taken
of
the
deity
in
the
mediator
or
a
phantom
is
substituted
instead
of
his
humanity
it
might
indeed
be
useful
to
refute
the
grosser
fallacies
of
servetus
with
which
he
has
fascinated
himself
and
others
that
the
pious
reader
admonished
by
this
example
may
preserve
himself
within
the
bounds
of
sobriety
and
modesty
yet
i
conceive
this
will
be
unnecessary
here
as
i
have
already
done
it
in
a
separate
treatise
the
substance
of
them
all
is
that
the
son
of
god
was
from
the
beginning
an
ideal
existence
and
that
even
then
he
was
predestinated
to
be
a
man
who
was
to
be
the
essential
image
of
god
nor
does
he
acknowledge
any
other
word
of
god
than
what
consists
in
an
external
splendour
his
generation
he
explains
thus
that
there
existed
in
god
from
the
beginning
a
will
to
beget
a
son
which
was
carried
into
effect
by
his
actual
formation
he
likewise
confounds
the
spirit
with
the
word
by
asserting
that
god
distributed
the
invisible
word
and
spirit
into
body
and
soul
in
short
he
puts
the
prefiguration
of
christ
in
the
place
of
his
generation
and
affirms
that
he
who
was
then
in
external
appearance
a
shadowy
son
was
at
length
begotten
by
the
word
to
which
he
attributes
the
properties
of
seed
whence
it
will
follow
that
the
meanest
animals
are
equally
the
children
of
god
because
they
were
created
of
the
original
seed
of
the
word
of
god
for
though
he
compounds
christ
of
three
uncreated
elements
to
countenance
the
assertion
that
he
is
begotten
of
the
essence
of
god
yet
he
pretends
him
to
have
been
the
among
creatures
in
such
a
sense
that
even
inanimate
substances
according
to
their
rank
possess
the
same
essential
divinity
and
that
he
may
not
seem
to
despoil
christ
of
his
deity
he
asserts
that
his
flesh
is
coëssential
with
god
and
that
the
word
was
made
flesh
by
a
conversion
of
the
humanity
into
deity
thus
while
he
can
not
conceive
christ
to
be
the
son
of
god
unless
his
flesh
proceeded
from
the
essence
of
god
and
were
reconverted
into
deity
he
annihilates
the
eternal
hypostasis
of
the
word
and
deprives
us
of
the
son
of
david
the
promised
redeemer
he
frequently
indeed
repeats
this
that
the
son
was
begotten
of
god
by
knowledge
and
predestination
but
that
at
length
he
was
made
man
of
those
materials
which
in
the
beginning
appeared
with
god
in
the
three
elements
and
which
afterwards
appeared
in
the
first
light
of
the
world
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
pillar
of
fire
now
how
shamefully
he
contradicts
himself
it
would
be
too
tedious
to
relate
from
this
summary
the
judicious
reader
will
conclude
that
by
the
subtle
fallacies
of
this
heretic
the
hope
of
salvation
is
completely
extinguished
for
if
the
body
were
the
deity
itself
it
would
no
longer
be
the
temple
of
it
now
we
can
have
no
redeemer
except
him
who
became
man
by
being
really
begotten
of
the
seed
of
abraham
and
david
according
to
the
flesh
servetus
makes
a
very
improper
use
of
the
language
of
john
that
the
word
was
made
flesh
for
while
it
opposes
the
terror
of
nestorius
it
is
as
far
from
affording
the
least
countenance
to
this
impious
notion
which
originated
with
eutyches
the
sole
design
of
the
evangelist
was
to
assert
the
union
of
the
two
natures
in
one
person
chapter
xv
the
consideration
of
christ
s
three
offices
prophetical
regal
and
sacerdotal
necessary
to
our
knowing
the
end
of
his
mission
from
the
father
and
the
benefits
which
he
confers
on
us
it
is
a
just
observation
of
augustine
that
although
heretics
profess
the
name
of
christ
yet
he
is
not
a
foundation
to
them
in
common
with
the
pious
but
remains
exclusively
the
foundation
of
the
church
because
on
a
diligent
consideration
of
what
belongs
to
christ
christ
will
be
found
among
them
only
in
name
not
in
reality
thus
the
papists
in
the
present
age
although
the
name
of
the
son
of
god
the
redeemer
of
the
world
be
frequently
in
their
mouths
yet
since
they
are
contented
with
the
mere
name
and
despoil
him
of
his
power
and
dignity
these
words
of
paul
not
holding
the
head
are
truly
applicable
to
them
therefore
that
faith
may
find
in
christ
a
solid
ground
of
salvation
and
so
may
rely
on
him
it
is
proper
for
us
to
establish
this
principle
that
the
office
which
was
assigned
to
him
by
the
father
consists
of
three
parts
for
he
was
given
as
a
prophet
a
king
and
a
priest
though
we
should
derive
but
little
benefit
from
an
acquaintance
with
these
names
unaccompanied
with
a
knowledge
of
their
end
and
use
for
they
are
likewise
pronounced
among
the
papists
but
in
a
frigid
and
unprofitable
manner
while
they
are
ignorant
of
what
is
included
in
each
of
these
titles
we
have
before
observed
that
although
god
sent
prophets
one
after
another
in
a
continual
succession
and
never
left
his
people
destitute
of
useful
instruction
such
as
was
sufficient
for
salvation
yet
the
minds
of
the
pious
were
always
persuaded
that
the
full
light
of
understanding
was
not
to
be
expected
till
the
advent
of
the
messiah
and
that
this
opinion
had
even
reached
the
samaritans
notwithstanding
they
had
never
been
acquainted
with
the
true
religion
appears
from
the
speech
of
the
woman
when
messias
is
come
he
will
tell
us
all
nor
had
the
jews
entertained
this
sentiment
without
sufficient
ground
but
believed
as
they
had
been
taught
by
infallible
oracles
one
of
the
most
remarkable
is
this
passage
of
isaiah
behold
i
have
given
him
for
a
witness
to
the
people
a
leader
and
commander
to
the
people
just
as
he
had
before
styled
him
the
wonderful
in
the
same
manner
the
apostle
with
a
view
to
display
the
perfection
of
the
evangelical
doctrine
after
having
said
that
god
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets
adds
that
he
hath
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
but
because
it
was
the
office
of
all
the
prophets
to
keep
the
church
in
a
state
of
suspense
and
expectation
and
also
to
support
it
till
the
advent
of
the
mediator
we
therefore
find
the
faithful
complaining
in
their
dispersion
that
they
were
deprived
of
this
ordinary
blessing
we
see
not
our
signs
there
is
no
more
any
prophet
neither
is
there
among
us
any
that
knoweth
how
at
length
when
christ
was
at
no
great
distance
a
time
was
prefixed
for
daniel
to
seal
up
the
vision
and
prophecy
not
only
to
authenticate
the
prediction
it
contained
but
in
order
that
the
faithful
might
patiently
bear
for
a
time
the
want
of
prophets
because
the
plenitude
and
conclusion
of
all
revelations
was
near
at
hand
ii
now
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
appellation
of
christ
belongs
to
these
three
offices
for
we
know
that
under
the
law
not
only
priests
and
kings
but
prophets
also
were
anointed
with
holy
oil
hence
the
celebrated
title
of
messiah
was
given
to
the
promised
mediator
but
though
i
confess
that
he
was
called
the
messiah
with
particular
reference
to
his
kingdom
as
i
have
already
shown
yet
the
prophetical
and
sacerdotal
unctions
have
their
respective
places
and
must
not
be
neglected
by
us
the
former
is
expressly
mentioned
by
isaiah
in
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
lord
god
is
upon
me
because
the
lord
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
he
hath
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
to
proclaim
the
acceptable
year
of
the
we
see
that
he
was
anointed
by
the
spirit
to
be
a
preacher
and
witness
of
the
grace
of
the
father
and
that
not
in
a
common
manner
for
he
is
distinguished
from
other
teachers
who
held
a
similar
office
and
here
again
it
must
be
remarked
that
he
received
this
unction
not
only
for
himself
that
he
might
perform
the
office
of
a
teacher
but
for
his
whole
body
that
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
might
continually
be
attended
with
the
power
of
the
spirit
but
it
remains
beyond
all
doubt
that
by
this
perfection
of
doctrine
which
he
has
introduced
he
has
put
an
end
to
all
prophecies
so
that
they
who
not
contented
with
the
gospel
make
any
extraneous
addition
to
it
are
guilty
of
derogating
from
his
authority
for
that
voice
which
thundered
from
heaven
this
is
my
beloved
son
hear
ye
him
has
exalted
him
by
a
peculiar
privilege
above
all
others
from
the
head
this
unction
is
afterwards
diffused
over
the
members
according
to
the
prediction
of
joel
your
sons
and
your
daughters
shall
prophesy
and
see
but
the
declarations
of
paul
that
he
is
made
unto
us
wisdom
and
that
in
him
are
hid
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
have
rather
a
different
meaning
namely
that
beside
him
there
is
nothing
useful
to
be
known
and
that
they
who
by
faith
apprehend
him
as
he
is
have
embraced
the
whole
infinitude
of
celestial
blessings
for
which
reason
he
writes
in
another
place
i
determined
not
to
know
any
thing
among
you
save
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
which
is
perfectly
just
because
it
is
unlawful
to
go
beyond
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
and
the
tendency
of
the
prophetic
dignity
in
christ
is
to
assure
us
that
all
the
branches
of
perfect
wisdom
are
included
in
the
system
of
doctrine
which
he
has
given
us
iii
i
come
now
to
his
kingdom
of
which
it
would
be
useless
to
speak
without
first
apprizing
the
reader
that
it
is
of
a
spiritual
nature
because
thence
we
may
gather
what
is
its
use
and
what
advantage
it
confers
upon
us
and
in
short
all
its
power
and
eternity
the
eternity
which
the
angel
in
daniel
ascribes
to
the
person
of
christ
the
angel
in
luke
justly
applies
to
the
salvation
of
the
people
but
this
also
is
twofold
or
is
to
be
considered
in
two
points
of
view
one
extending
to
the
whole
body
of
the
church
the
other
belonging
to
every
individual
member
to
the
former
must
be
referred
the
following
passage
in
the
psalms
once
have
i
sworn
by
my
holiness
that
i
will
not
lie
unto
david
his
seed
shall
endure
for
ever
and
his
throne
as
the
sun
before
me
it
shall
be
established
for
ever
as
the
moon
and
as
a
faithful
witness
in
there
is
no
doubt
that
god
here
promises
to
be
the
everlasting
governor
and
defender
of
his
church
through
the
medium
of
his
son
for
the
truth
of
this
prophecy
will
only
be
found
in
christ
since
immediately
after
the
death
of
solomon
the
dignity
of
the
kingdom
sustained
a
considerable
degradation
the
greater
part
of
it
to
the
disgrace
of
the
family
of
david
being
transferred
to
a
private
man
and
afterwards
was
diminished
more
and
more
till
at
length
it
fell
in
a
melancholy
and
total
ruin
the
same
sentiment
is
conveyed
in
this
exclamation
of
isaiah
who
shall
declare
his
generation
for
when
he
pronounces
that
christ
will
survive
after
his
death
he
connects
his
members
with
him
therefore
whenever
we
hear
that
christ
is
armed
with
eternal
power
let
us
remember
that
this
is
the
bulwark
which
supports
the
perpetuity
of
the
church
that
amidst
the
turbulent
agitations
with
which
it
is
incessantly
harassed
and
amidst
the
painful
and
formidable
commotions
which
menace
it
with
innumerable
calamities
it
may
still
be
preserved
in
safety
thus
when
david
derides
the
presumption
of
the
enemies
who
attempt
to
break
the
yoke
of
god
and
of
his
christ
and
says
that
the
kings
and
the
people
rage
in
vain
since
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
heavens
is
sufficiently
powerful
to
repel
their
violence
assures
the
faithful
of
the
perpetual
preservation
of
the
church
and
animates
them
to
entertain
a
cheerful
hope
whenever
it
happens
to
be
oppressed
so
in
another
place
when
speaking
in
the
name
of
god
he
says
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
he
apprizes
us
that
though
numerous
and
powerful
enemies
conspire
to
assault
the
church
yet
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
prevail
against
that
immutable
decree
of
god
by
which
he
has
constituted
his
son
an
eternal
king
whence
it
follows
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
devil
with
all
the
assistance
of
the
world
ever
to
destroy
the
church
which
is
founded
on
the
eternal
throne
of
christ
now
with
respect
to
its
particular
use
to
each
individual
this
same
eternity
ought
to
encourage
our
hope
of
a
blessed
immortality
for
we
see
that
whatever
is
terrestrial
and
worldly
is
temporary
and
perishable
therefore
to
raise
our
hope
towards
heaven
christ
declares
that
his
kingdom
is
not
of
this
in
a
word
whenever
we
hear
that
the
kingdom
of
christ
is
spiritual
excited
by
this
declaration
we
ought
to
penetrate
to
the
hope
of
a
better
life
and
as
we
are
now
protected
by
the
power
of
christ
let
us
expect
the
full
benefit
of
this
grace
in
the
world
to
come
iv
the
truth
of
our
observation
that
it
is
impossible
to
perceive
the
nature
and
advantages
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
unless
we
know
it
to
be
spiritual
is
sufficiently
evident
from
a
consideration
of
the
hardship
and
misery
of
our
condition
in
the
state
of
warfare
under
the
cross
in
which
we
have
to
continue
as
long
as
we
live
what
advantage
then
could
accrue
to
us
from
being
collected
under
the
government
of
the
heavenly
king
if
the
benefit
of
it
were
not
to
extend
beyond
the
present
state
it
ought
therefore
to
be
known
that
whatever
felicity
is
promised
us
in
christ
consists
not
in
external
accommodations
such
as
a
life
of
joy
and
tranquillity
abundant
wealth
security
from
every
injury
and
numerous
delights
suited
to
our
carnal
desires
but
that
it
is
peculiar
to
the
heavenly
state
as
in
the
world
the
prosperous
and
desirable
state
of
a
nation
consists
partly
in
domestic
peace
and
an
abundance
of
all
blessings
and
every
good
and
partly
in
strong
bulwarks
to
secure
it
from
external
violence
so
christ
enriches
his
people
with
every
thing
necessary
to
the
eternal
salvation
of
their
souls
and
arms
them
with
strength
to
enable
them
to
stand
invincible
against
all
the
assaults
of
their
spiritual
foes
whence
we
infer
that
he
reigns
rather
for
us
than
for
himself
and
that
both
internally
and
externally
that
being
replenished
as
far
as
god
knows
to
be
necessary
for
us
with
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
of
which
we
are
naturally
destitute
we
may
perceive
from
these
that
we
are
truly
united
to
god
in
order
to
our
perfect
happiness
and
in
the
next
place
that
depending
on
the
power
of
the
same
spirit
we
may
not
doubt
of
being
always
victorious
over
the
devil
the
world
and
every
kind
of
evil
this
is
implied
in
the
answer
of
christ
to
the
pharisees
that
as
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
it
cometh
not
with
for
it
is
probable
that
in
consequence
of
his
having
professed
himself
to
be
that
king
under
whom
the
highest
blessing
of
god
was
to
be
expected
they
ludicrously
desired
him
to
display
the
insignia
of
his
dignity
but
to
prevent
them
who
had
otherwise
too
great
a
propensity
to
the
world
from
directing
all
their
attention
to
external
pomp
he
commands
them
to
enter
into
their
own
consciences
for
the
kingdom
of
god
is
righteousness
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
here
we
are
briefly
taught
what
advantage
results
to
us
from
the
kingdom
of
christ
for
since
it
is
not
terrestrial
or
carnal
so
as
to
be
liable
to
corruption
but
spiritual
it
elevates
us
even
to
eternal
life
that
we
may
patiently
pass
through
this
life
in
afflictions
hunger
cold
contempt
reproaches
and
other
disagreeable
circumstances
contented
with
this
single
assurance
that
our
king
will
never
desert
us
but
will
assist
our
necessities
till
having
completed
the
term
of
our
warfare
we
shall
be
called
to
the
triumph
for
the
rule
of
his
government
is
to
communicate
to
us
whatever
he
has
received
of
the
father
now
since
he
furnishes
and
arms
us
with
his
power
adorns
us
with
his
beauty
and
magnificence
and
enriches
us
with
his
wealth
hence
we
derive
most
abundant
cause
for
glorying
and
even
confidence
to
enable
us
to
contend
with
intrepidity
against
the
devil
sin
and
death
in
the
last
place
since
we
are
clothed
with
his
righteousness
we
may
boldly
rise
superior
to
all
the
reproaches
of
the
world
and
as
he
liberally
replenishes
us
with
his
favours
so
we
ought
on
our
part
to
bring
forth
fruit
to
his
glory
his
regal
unction
therefore
is
not
represented
to
us
as
composed
of
oil
and
aromatic
perfumes
but
he
is
called
the
christ
of
god
because
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
rested
upon
him
this
is
the
oil
of
gladness
with
which
the
psalmist
declares
him
to
have
been
anointed
above
his
fellows
because
if
he
were
not
possessed
of
such
excellence
we
should
be
all
oppressed
with
poverty
and
famine
and
as
we
have
observed
he
was
not
enriched
on
his
own
private
account
but
that
he
might
communicate
his
abundance
to
them
who
are
hungry
and
thirsty
for
as
it
is
said
that
the
father
giveth
not
the
spirit
by
measure
unto
him
so
another
passage
expresses
the
that
of
his
fulness
we
might
all
receive
and
grace
for
from
this
source
proceeds
the
munificence
mentioned
by
paul
by
which
grace
is
variously
distributed
to
the
faithful
according
to
the
measure
of
the
gift
of
these
passages
abundantly
confirm
what
i
have
the
kingdom
of
christ
consists
in
the
spirit
not
in
terrestrial
pleasures
or
pomps
and
that
therefore
in
order
to
be
partakers
of
it
we
must
renounce
the
world
a
visible
emblem
of
this
unction
was
displayed
at
the
baptism
of
christ
when
the
holy
spirit
rested
on
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
that
the
holy
spirit
and
his
gifts
are
designated
by
the
word
unction
ought
not
to
be
esteemed
either
novel
or
absurd
because
we
have
no
other
support
even
for
our
animal
life
but
especially
as
it
respects
the
heavenly
life
we
have
not
a
particle
of
vigour
in
us
but
what
we
have
received
from
the
holy
spirit
who
has
chosen
his
residence
in
christ
that
those
heavenly
riches
which
we
so
greatly
need
may
from
him
be
copiously
distributed
to
us
now
as
the
faithful
stand
invincible
in
the
strength
of
their
king
and
are
enriched
with
his
spiritual
blessings
they
are
justly
denominated
christians
but
to
this
eternity
of
which
we
have
spoken
there
is
nothing
repugnant
in
these
expressions
of
paul
then
he
shall
deliver
up
the
kingdom
to
god
even
the
father
and
then
shall
the
son
himself
be
subject
that
god
may
be
all
in
he
only
intends
that
in
that
perfect
glory
the
administration
of
the
kingdom
will
not
be
the
same
as
it
is
at
present
for
the
father
has
given
all
power
to
the
son
that
he
may
guide
nourish
and
sustain
us
by
his
hand
may
guard
us
by
his
protection
and
aid
us
in
all
our
necessities
thus
during
the
period
of
our
pilgrimage
while
we
are
absent
from
god
christ
interposes
between
us
to
bring
us
by
degrees
to
a
perfect
union
with
him
his
being
said
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
is
equivalent
to
his
being
called
the
father
s
vicegerent
intrusted
with
all
the
power
of
the
government
because
it
is
the
will
of
god
to
govern
and
defend
his
church
through
the
mediation
of
his
son
this
is
the
explanation
given
by
paul
to
the
ephesians
that
he
was
set
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
to
be
the
head
over
all
things
to
the
church
which
is
his
to
the
same
purpose
is
what
he
states
in
another
place
that
there
has
been
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
name
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
bow
and
that
every
tongue
should
confess
that
jesus
christ
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
for
even
in
these
words
he
displays
the
order
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
necessary
for
our
present
infirmity
thus
paul
rightly
concludes
that
god
himself
will
then
be
the
only
head
of
the
church
because
the
functions
of
christ
in
the
preservation
and
salvation
of
the
church
will
be
fully
discharged
for
the
same
reason
the
scripture
often
styles
him
lord
because
the
father
has
given
him
authority
over
us
that
he
may
exercise
his
own
dominion
by
the
agency
of
his
son
for
though
there
be
many
authorities
celebrated
in
the
world
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
of
whom
are
all
things
and
we
in
him
and
one
lord
jesus
christ
by
whom
are
all
things
and
we
by
him
says
paul
whence
it
may
justly
be
concluded
that
he
is
the
same
god
who
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
has
asserted
himself
to
be
the
king
and
lawgiver
of
his
church
for
though
he
every
where
ascribes
all
the
authority
he
possesses
to
the
free
gift
of
the
father
yet
he
only
signifies
that
he
reigns
in
the
majesty
and
power
of
god
because
he
assumed
the
character
of
mediator
in
order
to
approach
to
us
by
descending
from
the
bosom
and
incomprehensible
glory
of
his
father
wherefore
it
is
the
more
reasonable
that
we
should
all
with
one
consent
be
ready
to
obey
him
and
with
the
greatest
alacrity
conform
all
our
services
to
his
will
for
as
he
combines
the
offices
of
a
king
and
a
shepherd
towards
the
faithful
who
yield
a
voluntary
obedience
so
on
the
contrary
we
are
informed
that
he
bears
a
rod
of
iron
to
break
all
the
stubborn
and
rebellious
and
to
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter
s
it
is
likewise
predicted
that
he
shall
judge
among
the
heathen
he
shall
fill
the
places
with
the
dead
bodies
he
shall
wound
the
heads
over
many
of
this
there
are
some
instances
to
be
seen
in
the
present
state
but
the
complete
accomplishment
of
it
will
be
at
the
last
judgment
which
may
also
with
propriety
be
considered
as
the
last
act
of
his
reign
vi
concerning
his
priesthood
we
have
briefly
to
remark
that
the
end
and
use
of
it
is
that
he
may
be
a
mediator
pure
from
every
stain
and
by
his
holiness
may
render
us
acceptable
to
god
but
because
the
righteous
curse
prevents
our
access
to
him
and
god
in
his
character
of
judge
is
offended
with
us
order
that
our
priest
may
appease
the
wrath
of
god
and
procure
his
favour
for
us
there
is
a
necessity
for
the
intervention
of
an
atonement
wherefore
that
christ
might
perform
this
office
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
appear
with
a
sacrifice
for
even
under
the
law
the
priest
was
not
permitted
to
enter
the
sanctuary
without
blood
that
the
faithful
might
know
that
notwithstanding
the
interposition
of
the
priest
as
an
intercessor
yet
it
was
impossible
for
god
to
be
propitiated
without
the
expiation
of
sins
this
subject
the
apostle
discusses
at
large
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
from
the
seventh
chapter
almost
to
the
end
of
the
tenth
but
the
sum
of
the
whole
is
the
sacerdotal
dignity
belongs
exclusively
to
christ
because
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
death
he
has
abolished
our
guilt
and
made
satisfaction
for
our
sins
the
vast
importance
of
this
we
are
taught
by
that
solemn
oath
which
the
lord
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
god
intended
to
establish
that
capital
point
which
he
knew
to
be
the
principal
hinge
on
which
our
salvation
turns
and
as
we
have
observed
there
is
no
access
to
god
either
for
ourselves
or
our
prayers
unless
our
priest
sanctify
us
by
taking
away
our
sins
and
obtain
for
us
that
grace
from
which
we
are
excluded
by
the
pollution
of
our
vices
and
crimes
thus
we
see
it
is
necessary
to
begin
with
the
death
of
christ
in
order
to
experience
the
efficacy
and
utility
of
his
priesthood
hence
it
follows
that
he
is
an
eternal
intercessor
and
that
it
is
by
his
intervention
we
obtain
favour
with
god
hence
proceeds
not
only
confidence
in
prayer
but
also
tranquillity
to
the
consciences
of
the
faithful
while
they
recline
in
safety
on
the
paternal
indulgence
of
god
and
are
certainly
persuaded
that
he
is
pleased
with
whatever
is
consecrated
to
him
through
the
mediator
now
as
under
the
law
god
commanded
victims
to
be
offered
to
him
from
the
flock
and
the
herd
a
new
and
different
method
has
been
adopted
in
the
case
of
christ
that
the
sacrifice
should
be
the
same
with
the
priest
because
it
was
impossible
to
find
any
other
adequate
satisfaction
for
sins
or
any
one
worthy
of
so
great
an
honour
as
to
offer
to
god
his
only
begotten
son
besides
christ
sustains
the
character
of
a
priest
not
only
to
render
the
father
favourable
and
propitious
to
us
by
an
eternal
law
of
reconciliation
but
also
to
associate
us
with
himself
in
so
great
an
honour
for
we
who
are
polluted
in
ourselves
being
made
priests
in
him
offer
ourselves
and
all
our
services
to
god
and
enter
boldly
into
the
heavenly
sanctuary
so
that
the
sacrifices
of
prayers
and
praise
which
proceed
from
us
are
acceptable
and
a
smelling
savour
in
the
divine
presence
this
is
included
in
the
declaration
of
christ
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
myself
for
being
arrayed
in
his
holiness
he
having
dedicated
us
together
with
himself
to
the
father
we
who
are
otherwise
offensive
in
his
sight
become
acceptable
to
him
as
pure
unpolluted
and
holy
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
anointing
of
the
most
holy
which
is
mentioned
in
daniel
for
we
must
observe
the
contrast
between
this
unction
and
that
shadowy
unction
which
was
then
in
use
as
though
the
angel
had
said
that
the
shadows
would
be
dissipated
and
that
there
would
be
a
real
priesthood
in
the
person
of
christ
so
much
the
more
detestable
is
the
invention
of
those
who
not
content
with
the
priesthood
of
christ
have
presumed
to
take
upon
themselves
the
office
of
sacrificing
him
which
is
daily
attempted
among
the
papists
where
the
mass
is
considered
as
an
immolation
of
christ
chapter
xvi
christ
s
execution
of
the
office
of
a
redeemer
to
procure
our
salvation
his
death
resurrection
and
ascension
to
heaven
all
that
we
have
hitherto
advanced
concerning
christ
is
to
be
referred
to
this
point
that
being
condemned
dead
and
ruined
in
ourselves
we
should
seek
righteousness
deliverance
life
and
salvation
in
him
as
we
are
taught
by
this
remarkable
declaration
of
peter
that
there
is
none
other
name
under
heaven
given
among
men
whereby
we
must
be
the
name
of
jesus
was
given
him
not
rashly
or
by
a
fortuitous
accident
or
by
the
will
of
men
but
was
brought
from
heaven
by
the
angel
the
herald
of
the
supreme
decree
and
also
with
this
reason
annexed
to
it
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
sins
in
which
words
may
be
remarked
what
we
have
before
hinted
that
the
office
of
a
redeemer
was
assigned
to
him
in
order
that
he
might
be
our
saviour
nevertheless
the
redemption
would
be
incomplete
if
he
did
not
by
continual
advances
carry
us
forward
to
the
ultimate
end
of
salvation
therefore
as
soon
as
we
deviate
from
him
though
but
in
the
smallest
degree
we
gradually
lose
sight
of
salvation
which
resides
entirely
in
him
so
that
those
who
are
not
satisfied
with
him
voluntarily
deprive
themselves
of
all
grace
and
the
following
observation
of
bernard
is
worthy
of
recital
that
the
name
of
jesus
is
not
only
light
but
also
food
that
it
is
likewise
oil
without
which
all
the
food
of
the
soul
is
dry
that
it
is
salt
unseasoned
by
which
whatever
is
presented
to
us
is
insipid
finally
that
it
is
honey
in
the
mouth
melody
in
the
ear
joy
in
the
heart
and
medicine
to
the
soul
and
that
there
are
no
charms
in
any
discourse
where
his
name
is
not
but
here
we
ought
diligently
to
examine
how
he
has
procured
salvation
for
us
that
we
may
not
only
know
him
to
be
the
author
of
it
but
embracing
those
things
which
are
sufficient
for
the
establishment
of
our
faith
may
reject
every
thing
capable
of
drawing
us
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
for
since
no
man
can
descend
into
himself
and
seriously
consider
his
own
character
without
perceiving
that
god
is
angry
with
him
and
hostile
to
him
and
consequently
he
must
find
himself
under
a
necessity
of
anxiously
seeking
some
way
to
appease
him
which
can
never
be
done
without
a
satisfaction
is
a
case
in
which
the
strongest
assurance
is
required
for
sinners
till
they
be
delivered
from
guilt
are
always
subject
to
the
wrath
and
malediction
of
god
who
being
a
righteous
judge
never
suffers
his
law
to
be
violated
with
impunity
but
stands
prepared
to
avenge
it
ii
before
we
proceed
any
further
let
us
examine
by
the
way
how
it
could
be
consistent
that
god
who
prevents
us
with
his
mercy
should
be
our
enemy
till
he
was
reconciled
to
us
by
christ
for
how
could
he
have
given
us
a
special
pledge
of
his
love
in
his
only
begotten
son
if
he
had
not
previously
embraced
us
in
his
gratuitous
favour
as
there
is
some
appearance
of
contradiction
therefore
in
this
representation
i
shall
solve
the
difficulty
the
spirit
speaks
in
the
scriptures
nearly
in
this
god
was
an
enemy
to
men
till
by
the
death
of
christ
they
were
restored
to
his
favour
that
they
were
under
the
curse
till
their
iniquity
was
expiated
by
his
sacrifice
that
they
were
separated
from
god
till
they
were
restored
to
union
with
him
by
the
body
of
christ
such
modes
of
expression
are
accommodated
to
our
capacity
that
we
may
better
understand
how
miserable
and
calamitous
our
condition
is
out
of
christ
for
if
it
were
not
clearly
expressed
that
we
are
obnoxious
to
the
wrath
and
vengeance
of
god
and
to
eternal
death
we
should
not
so
fully
discover
how
miserable
we
must
be
without
the
divine
mercy
nor
should
we
so
highly
estimate
the
blessing
of
deliverance
for
example
let
any
man
be
addressed
in
the
following
manner
if
while
you
remained
a
sinner
god
had
hated
you
and
rejected
you
according
to
your
demerits
horrible
destruction
would
have
befallen
you
but
because
he
has
voluntarily
and
of
his
own
gratuitous
kindness
retained
you
in
his
favour
and
not
permitted
you
to
be
alienated
from
him
he
has
thus
delivered
you
from
that
danger
he
will
be
affected
and
will
in
some
measure
perceive
how
much
he
is
indebted
to
the
divine
mercy
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
be
told
what
the
scripture
teaches
that
he
was
alienated
from
god
by
sin
an
heir
of
wrath
obnoxious
to
the
punishment
of
eternal
death
excluded
from
all
hope
of
salvation
a
total
stranger
to
the
divine
blessing
a
slave
to
satan
a
captive
under
the
yoke
of
sin
and
in
a
word
condemned
to
and
already
involved
in
a
horrible
destruction
that
in
this
situation
christ
interposed
as
an
intercessor
that
he
has
taken
upon
himself
and
suffered
the
punishment
which
by
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
impended
over
all
sinners
that
by
his
blood
he
has
expiated
those
crimes
which
render
them
odious
to
god
that
by
this
expiation
god
the
father
has
been
satisfied
and
duly
atoned
that
by
this
intercessor
his
wrath
has
been
appeased
that
this
is
the
foundation
of
peace
between
god
and
men
that
this
is
the
bond
of
his
benevolence
towards
them
will
he
not
be
the
more
affected
by
these
things
in
proportion
to
the
more
correct
and
lively
representation
of
the
depth
of
calamity
from
which
he
has
been
delivered
in
short
since
it
is
impossible
for
the
life
which
is
presented
by
the
mercy
of
god
to
be
embraced
by
our
hearts
with
sufficient
ardour
or
received
with
becoming
gratitude
unless
we
have
been
previously
terrified
and
distressed
with
the
fear
of
the
divine
wrath
and
the
horror
of
eternal
death
we
are
instructed
by
the
sacred
doctrine
that
irrespective
of
christ
we
may
contemplate
god
as
in
some
measure
incensed
against
us
and
his
hand
armed
for
our
destruction
and
that
we
may
embrace
his
benevolence
and
paternal
love
only
in
christ
iii
now
though
this
is
expressed
according
to
the
weakness
of
our
capacity
yet
it
is
strictly
true
for
god
who
is
the
perfection
of
righteousness
can
not
love
iniquity
which
he
beholds
in
us
all
we
all
therefore
have
in
us
that
which
deserves
god
s
hatred
wherefore
in
respect
of
our
corrupt
nature
and
the
succeeding
depravity
of
our
lives
we
are
all
really
offensive
to
god
guilty
in
his
sight
and
born
to
the
damnation
of
hell
but
because
the
lord
will
not
lose
in
us
that
which
is
his
own
he
yet
discovers
something
that
his
goodness
may
love
for
notwithstanding
we
are
sinners
through
our
own
fault
yet
we
are
still
his
creatures
notwithstanding
we
have
brought
death
upon
ourselves
yet
he
had
created
us
for
life
thus
by
a
pure
and
gratuitous
love
towards
us
he
is
excited
to
receive
us
into
favour
but
if
there
is
a
perpetual
and
irreconcilable
opposition
between
righteousness
and
iniquity
he
can
not
receive
us
entirely
as
long
as
we
remain
sinners
therefore
to
remove
all
occasion
of
enmity
and
to
reconcile
us
completely
to
himself
he
abolishes
all
our
guilt
by
the
expiation
exhibited
in
the
death
of
christ
that
we
who
before
were
polluted
and
impure
may
appear
righteous
and
holy
in
his
sight
the
love
of
god
the
father
therefore
precedes
our
reconciliation
in
christ
or
rather
it
is
because
he
first
loves
that
he
afterwards
reconciles
us
to
himself
but
because
till
christ
relieves
us
by
his
death
we
are
not
freed
from
that
iniquity
which
deserves
the
indignation
of
god
and
is
accursed
and
condemned
in
his
sight
we
have
not
a
complete
and
solid
union
with
god
before
we
are
united
to
him
by
christ
and
therefore
if
we
would
assure
ourselves
that
god
is
pacified
and
propitious
to
us
we
must
fix
our
eyes
and
hearts
on
christ
alone
since
it
is
by
him
only
that
we
really
obtain
the
imputation
of
sins
the
imputation
of
which
is
connected
with
the
divine
wrath
iv
for
this
reason
paul
says
that
the
love
which
god
had
for
us
before
the
creation
of
the
world
was
founded
on
christ
this
doctrine
is
clear
and
consistent
with
the
scripture
and
admirably
reconciles
the
different
passages
where
it
is
said
that
god
manifested
his
love
to
us
by
the
gift
of
his
only
begotten
son
and
yet
that
he
was
our
enemy
till
he
was
reconciled
by
the
death
of
christ
but
for
a
further
confirmation
of
it
to
such
as
require
the
testimony
of
the
ancient
church
i
will
cite
a
passage
from
augustine
which
expressly
maintains
the
same
the
love
of
god
says
he
is
incomprehensible
and
immutable
for
he
did
not
begin
to
love
us
when
we
were
reconciled
to
him
by
the
blood
of
his
son
but
he
loved
us
before
the
creation
of
the
world
that
we
might
be
his
children
together
with
his
only
begotten
son
even
before
we
had
any
existence
therefore
our
reconciliation
by
the
death
of
christ
must
not
be
understood
as
if
he
reconciled
us
to
god
that
god
might
begin
to
love
those
whom
he
had
before
hated
but
we
are
reconciled
to
him
who
already
loved
us
but
with
whom
we
were
at
enmity
on
account
of
sin
and
whether
my
assertion
be
true
let
the
apostle
attest
god
says
he
commendeth
his
love
toward
us
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
he
loved
us
therefore
even
when
we
were
in
the
exercise
of
enmity
against
him
and
engaged
in
the
practice
of
iniquity
wherefore
in
a
wonderful
and
divine
manner
he
both
hated
and
loved
us
at
the
same
time
he
hated
us
as
being
different
from
what
he
had
made
us
but
as
our
iniquity
had
not
entirely
destroyed
his
work
in
us
he
could
at
the
same
time
in
every
one
of
us
hate
what
we
had
done
and
love
what
proceeded
from
this
is
the
language
of
augustine
now
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
how
christ
by
the
abolition
of
our
sins
has
destroyed
the
enmity
between
god
and
us
and
procured
a
righteousness
to
render
him
favourable
and
propitious
to
us
it
may
be
replied
in
general
that
he
accomplished
it
for
us
by
the
whole
course
of
his
obedience
this
is
proved
by
the
testimony
of
paul
as
by
one
man
s
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
and
indeed
in
another
place
he
extends
the
cause
of
the
pardon
which
exempts
us
from
the
malediction
of
the
law
to
the
whole
life
of
christ
when
the
fulness
of
the
time
was
come
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
of
a
woman
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
thus
he
himself
affirmed
even
his
baptism
to
be
a
branch
of
his
righteousness
because
he
acted
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
father
in
short
from
the
time
of
his
assuming
the
character
of
a
servant
he
began
to
pay
the
price
of
our
deliverance
in
order
to
redeem
us
yet
more
precisely
to
define
the
means
of
our
salvation
the
scripture
ascribes
this
in
a
peculiar
manner
to
the
death
of
christ
he
himself
announces
that
he
gives
his
life
a
ransom
for
paul
teaches
that
he
died
for
our
john
the
baptist
exclaims
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
paul
in
another
place
declares
that
we
are
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
also
that
we
are
justified
by
his
blood
and
reconciled
by
his
again
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
i
shall
not
proceed
with
all
the
proofs
because
the
catalogue
would
be
immense
and
many
of
them
must
hereafter
be
cited
in
their
proper
order
wherefore
in
what
is
called
the
apostles
creed
there
is
very
properly
an
immediate
transition
from
the
birth
of
christ
to
his
death
and
resurrection
in
which
the
sum
of
perfect
salvation
consists
yet
there
is
no
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
obedience
which
he
performed
in
his
life
as
paul
comprehends
the
whole
of
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
when
he
says
that
he
made
himself
of
no
reputation
and
took
upon
him
the
form
of
a
servant
and
became
obedient
unto
death
even
the
death
of
the
and
indeed
his
voluntary
submission
is
the
principal
circumstance
even
in
his
death
because
the
sacrifice
unless
freely
offered
would
have
been
unavailable
to
the
acquisition
of
righteousness
therefore
our
lord
after
having
declared
i
lay
down
my
life
for
the
sheep
expressly
adds
no
man
taketh
it
from
in
which
sense
isaiah
says
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
openeth
not
his
and
the
evangelical
history
relates
that
he
went
forth
to
meet
the
soldiers
and
that
before
pilate
he
neglected
making
any
defence
and
waited
to
submit
to
the
sentence
nor
was
this
without
inward
conflict
because
he
had
taken
our
infirmities
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
this
proof
of
his
obedience
to
his
father
and
it
was
no
mean
specimen
of
his
incomparable
love
to
us
to
contend
with
horrible
fear
and
amid
those
dreadful
torments
to
neglect
all
care
of
himself
that
he
might
promote
our
benefit
indeed
we
must
admit
that
it
was
impossible
for
god
to
be
truly
appeased
in
any
other
way
than
by
christ
renouncing
all
concern
for
himself
and
submitting
and
devoting
himself
entirely
to
his
will
on
this
subject
the
apostle
appositely
cites
the
testimony
of
the
psalmist
then
said
i
lo
i
come
in
the
volume
of
the
book
it
is
written
of
me
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
o
my
god
yea
thy
law
is
within
my
but
since
terrified
consciences
find
no
rest
but
in
a
sacrifice
and
ablution
to
expiate
their
sins
we
are
properly
directed
thither
and
the
death
of
christ
is
exhibited
to
us
as
the
source
of
life
now
because
our
guilt
rendered
us
liable
to
a
curse
at
the
heavenly
tribunal
of
god
the
condemnation
of
christ
before
pontius
pilate
the
governor
of
judea
is
stated
in
the
first
place
that
we
may
know
that
on
this
righteous
person
was
inflicted
the
punishment
which
belonged
to
us
we
could
not
escape
the
terrible
judgment
of
god
to
deliver
us
from
it
christ
submitted
to
be
condemned
even
before
a
wicked
and
profane
mortal
for
the
name
of
the
governor
is
mentioned
not
only
to
establish
the
credit
of
the
history
but
that
we
may
learn
what
is
taught
by
isaiah
that
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
for
to
supersede
our
condemnation
it
was
not
sufficient
for
him
to
suffer
any
kind
of
death
but
to
accomplish
our
redemption
that
kind
of
death
was
to
be
chosen
by
which
both
sustaining
our
condemnation
and
atoning
for
our
sins
he
might
deliver
us
from
both
had
he
been
assassinated
by
robbers
or
murdered
in
a
popular
tumult
in
such
a
death
there
would
have
been
no
appearance
of
satisfaction
but
when
he
is
placed
as
a
criminal
before
the
tribunal
he
is
accused
and
overpowered
by
the
testimony
of
witnesses
and
by
the
mouth
of
the
judge
is
condemned
to
die
understand
from
these
circumstances
that
he
sustained
the
character
of
a
malefactor
and
we
shall
remark
two
things
which
were
foretold
in
the
predictions
of
the
prophets
and
afford
peculiar
consolation
and
confirmation
to
our
faith
for
when
we
are
told
that
christ
was
sent
from
the
tribunal
of
the
judge
to
the
place
of
execution
and
suspended
between
two
thieves
we
see
the
completion
of
that
prophecy
which
is
cited
by
the
evangelist
he
was
numbered
with
the
for
what
reason
to
sustain
the
character
of
a
sinner
not
of
a
righteous
or
innocent
person
for
he
died
not
for
his
innocence
but
on
account
of
sin
on
the
contrary
when
we
hear
him
absolved
by
the
same
mouth
by
which
he
was
condemned
for
pilate
was
constrained
repeatedly
to
give
a
public
testimony
of
his
innocence
let
it
remind
us
of
what
we
read
in
another
prophet
i
restored
that
which
i
took
not
thus
we
shall
behold
christ
sustaining
the
character
of
a
sinner
and
malefactor
while
from
the
lustre
of
his
innocence
it
will
at
the
same
time
evidently
appear
that
he
was
loaded
with
the
guilt
of
others
but
had
none
of
his
own
he
suffered
then
under
pontius
pilate
after
having
been
condemned
as
a
criminal
by
the
solemn
sentence
of
the
governor
yet
not
in
such
a
manner
but
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
pronounced
to
be
righteous
by
the
declaration
of
the
same
judge
that
he
found
in
him
no
cause
of
accusation
this
is
our
absolution
that
the
guilt
which
made
us
obnoxious
to
punishment
is
transferred
to
the
person
of
the
son
of
god
for
we
ought
particularly
to
remember
this
satisfaction
that
we
may
not
spend
our
whole
lives
in
terror
and
anxiety
as
though
we
were
pursued
by
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
which
the
son
of
god
has
transferred
to
himself
vi
moreover
the
species
of
death
which
he
suffered
is
fraught
with
a
peculiar
mystery
the
cross
was
accursed
not
only
in
the
opinion
of
men
but
by
the
decree
of
the
divine
law
therefore
when
christ
is
lifted
up
upon
it
he
renders
himself
obnoxious
to
the
curse
and
this
was
necessary
to
be
done
that
by
this
transfer
we
might
be
delivered
from
every
curse
which
awaited
us
or
rather
was
already
inflicted
upon
us
on
account
of
our
iniquities
this
was
also
prefigured
in
the
law
for
the
victims
and
expiations
offered
for
sins
were
called
אשמות
a
word
which
properly
signifies
sin
itself
by
this
appellation
the
spirit
intended
to
suggest
that
they
were
vicarious
sacrifices
to
receive
and
sustain
the
curse
due
to
sin
but
that
which
was
figuratively
represented
in
the
mosaic
sacrifices
is
actually
exhibited
in
christ
the
archetype
of
the
figures
wherefore
in
order
to
effect
a
complete
expiation
he
gave
his
soul
אשם
that
is
atoning
sacrifice
for
as
the
prophet
says
so
that
our
guilt
and
punishment
being
as
it
were
transferred
to
him
they
must
cease
to
be
imputed
to
us
the
apostle
more
explicitly
testifies
the
same
when
he
says
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
for
the
son
of
god
though
perfectly
free
from
all
sin
nevertheless
assumed
the
disgrace
and
ignominy
of
our
iniquities
and
on
the
other
hand
arrayed
us
in
his
purity
he
appears
to
have
intended
the
same
when
he
says
concerning
sin
that
it
was
condemned
in
the
flesh
that
is
in
christ
for
the
father
destroyed
the
power
of
sin
when
the
curse
of
it
was
transferred
to
the
body
of
christ
this
expression
therefore
indicates
that
christ
at
his
death
was
offered
to
the
father
as
an
expiatory
sacrifice
in
order
that
a
complete
atonement
being
made
by
his
oblation
we
may
no
longer
dread
the
divine
wrath
now
it
is
evident
what
the
prophet
meant
when
he
said
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
namely
that
when
he
was
about
to
expiate
our
sins
they
were
transferred
to
him
by
imputation
the
cross
to
which
he
was
fixed
was
a
symbol
of
this
as
the
apostle
informs
us
christ
hath
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
being
made
a
curse
for
us
for
it
is
written
cursed
is
every
one
that
hangeth
on
a
tree
that
the
blessing
of
abraham
might
come
on
the
gentiles
through
jesus
peter
alluded
to
the
same
where
he
said
he
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
because
from
the
visible
symbol
of
the
curse
we
more
clearly
apprehend
that
the
burden
with
which
we
were
oppressed
was
imposed
on
him
nor
must
we
conceive
that
he
submitted
to
a
curse
which
overwhelmed
him
but
on
the
contrary
that
by
sustaining
it
he
depressed
broke
and
destroyed
all
its
power
wherefore
faith
apprehends
an
absolution
in
the
condemnation
of
christ
and
a
benediction
in
his
curse
it
is
not
without
reason
therefore
that
paul
magnificently
proclaims
the
triumph
which
christ
gained
for
himself
on
the
cross
as
though
the
cross
which
was
full
of
ignominy
had
been
converted
into
a
triumphal
chariot
for
he
says
that
he
nailed
to
his
cross
the
which
was
contrary
to
us
and
having
spoiled
principalities
and
powers
he
made
a
show
of
them
nor
should
this
surprise
us
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
another
apostle
christ
offered
himself
through
the
eternal
hence
arose
that
change
of
the
nature
of
things
but
that
these
things
may
be
deeply
rooted
and
firmly
fixed
in
our
hearts
let
us
always
remember
his
sacrifice
and
ablution
for
we
certainly
could
have
no
confidence
that
christ
was
our
απολυτρωσις
και
αντιλυτρον
και
ἱλαστηριον
redemption
ransom
and
propitiation
if
he
had
not
been
a
slaughtered
victim
and
for
this
reason
it
is
that
when
the
scripture
exhibits
the
method
of
redemption
it
so
often
makes
mention
of
blood
though
the
blood
shed
by
christ
has
not
only
served
as
an
atonement
to
god
but
likewise
as
a
laver
to
purge
away
our
pollutions
vii
it
follows
in
the
creed
that
he
died
and
was
buried
in
which
may
be
further
seen
how
in
every
respect
he
substituted
himself
in
our
room
to
pay
the
price
of
our
redemption
death
held
us
in
bondage
under
his
yoke
christ
to
deliver
us
from
it
surrendered
himself
to
his
power
in
our
stead
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
apostle
when
he
says
that
he
tasted
death
for
every
for
by
his
death
he
prevented
us
from
dying
or
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
by
his
death
recovered
life
for
us
but
in
this
respect
he
differed
from
surrendered
himself
to
death
to
be
as
it
were
overcome
by
it
not
that
he
might
be
absorbed
in
its
abysses
but
rather
that
he
might
destroy
that
by
which
we
should
have
been
at
length
devoured
he
surrendered
himself
to
death
to
be
subdued
not
that
he
might
be
overwhelmed
by
its
power
but
rather
that
he
might
overthrow
that
which
threatened
us
which
indeed
had
already
overcome
us
and
was
triumphing
over
us
lastly
he
died
that
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
that
is
the
devil
and
deliver
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
this
is
the
first
benefit
we
have
received
from
his
death
the
second
is
that
by
a
communication
of
himself
he
mortifies
our
members
which
are
upon
the
earth
that
they
may
no
longer
perform
their
own
actions
and
slays
our
old
man
that
it
may
not
flourish
and
bear
fruit
any
more
the
burial
of
christ
has
the
same
tendency
namely
that
being
made
partakers
of
it
we
may
be
buried
to
sin
for
when
the
apostle
teaches
us
that
we
have
been
planted
in
the
likeness
of
the
death
of
christ
and
buried
with
him
to
the
death
of
sin
that
by
his
cross
the
world
is
crucified
unto
us
and
we
unto
the
world
and
that
we
are
dead
with
him
he
not
only
exhorts
us
to
imitate
the
example
of
his
death
but
declares
that
it
contains
such
an
efficacy
as
ought
to
be
conspicuous
in
all
christians
unless
they
wish
to
render
that
death
ineffectual
and
useless
in
the
death
and
burial
of
christ
therefore
we
have
a
twofold
benefit
proposed
to
our
from
the
thraldom
of
death
and
the
mortification
of
our
flesh
viii
but
it
is
not
right
to
omit
his
descent
into
hell
which
is
of
no
small
importance
towards
the
accomplishment
of
redemption
for
though
it
appears
from
the
writings
of
the
ancients
that
this
article
of
the
creed
was
not
always
in
common
use
in
the
churches
yet
in
discussing
a
system
of
doctrine
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
it
as
containing
a
mystery
highly
useful
and
by
no
means
to
be
despised
indeed
there
are
some
of
the
ancients
who
do
not
omit
it
hence
we
may
conjecture
that
it
was
inserted
a
little
after
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
was
not
immediately
but
gradually
received
in
the
churches
this
at
least
can
not
be
controverted
that
it
was
agreeable
to
the
general
opinion
of
all
the
faithful
since
there
is
not
one
of
the
fathers
who
does
not
mention
in
his
writings
the
descent
of
christ
into
hell
though
they
explain
it
in
different
senses
but
by
whom
or
at
what
period
it
was
first
inserted
is
of
little
consequence
it
is
of
more
importance
that
the
creed
should
present
us
a
full
and
complete
summary
of
faith
into
which
nothing
should
be
inserted
but
what
is
taken
from
god
s
most
holy
word
yet
if
any
morosely
refuse
to
admit
it
into
the
creed
it
shall
presently
be
proved
to
be
so
necessary
to
the
perfection
of
our
redemption
that
the
omission
of
it
considerably
lessens
the
benefit
of
the
death
of
christ
some
again
are
of
opinion
that
this
clause
contains
nothing
new
but
is
only
a
repetition
in
other
words
of
what
had
before
been
said
respecting
his
burial
because
the
word
here
rendered
hell
is
frequently
used
in
the
scriptures
to
signify
the
grave
i
admit
the
truth
of
their
observation
respecting
the
signification
of
this
word
that
it
is
frequently
to
be
understood
of
the
grave
but
their
opinion
is
opposed
by
two
reasons
which
easily
induce
me
to
dissent
from
them
for
what
extreme
carelessness
it
would
betray
after
a
plain
fact
had
been
stated
in
the
most
explicit
and
familiar
manner
to
assert
it
a
second
time
in
an
obscure
combination
of
words
calculated
rather
to
perplex
than
to
elucidate
it
for
when
two
phrases
expressive
of
the
same
thing
are
connected
together
the
latter
ought
to
be
an
explanation
of
the
former
but
what
an
explanation
would
this
be
if
one
were
to
express
it
thus
when
christ
is
said
to
have
been
buried
the
meaning
is
that
he
descended
into
hell
besides
it
is
not
probable
that
such
a
superfluous
tautology
could
have
found
its
way
into
this
compendium
in
which
the
principal
articles
of
faith
are
summarily
expressed
with
the
utmost
possible
brevity
and
i
doubt
not
that
all
who
have
considered
this
point
with
any
attention
will
easily
assent
to
what
i
have
advanced
ix
others
give
a
different
interpretation
that
christ
descended
to
the
souls
of
the
fathers
who
had
died
under
the
law
for
the
purpose
of
announcing
the
accomplishment
of
redemption
and
liberating
them
from
the
prison
in
which
they
were
confined
to
this
purpose
they
pervert
a
passage
in
the
psalms
that
he
hath
broken
the
gates
of
brass
and
cut
the
bars
of
iron
in
sunder
and
another
in
zechariah
i
have
sent
forth
thy
prisoners
out
of
the
pit
wherein
is
no
but
since
the
psalmist
celebrates
the
liberation
of
those
who
are
suffering
captivity
and
imprisonment
in
distant
countries
and
zechariah
compares
the
destruction
in
which
the
people
had
been
overwhelmed
in
babylon
to
a
dry
pit
or
abyss
and
at
the
same
time
suggests
that
the
salvation
of
the
whole
church
is
a
deliverance
from
the
abysses
of
hell
i
know
not
how
it
came
to
pass
that
posterity
should
imagine
a
subterraneous
cavern
to
which
they
have
given
the
name
of
limbus
but
this
fable
although
it
is
maintained
by
great
authors
and
even
in
the
present
age
is
by
many
seriously
defended
as
a
truth
is
after
all
nothing
but
a
fable
for
to
confine
the
souls
of
the
dead
in
a
prison
is
quite
puerile
but
what
necessity
was
there
for
christ
to
descend
thither
in
order
to
liberate
them
i
freely
confess
indeed
that
christ
illuminated
them
by
the
power
of
his
spirit
that
they
might
know
that
the
grace
which
they
had
only
tasted
by
hope
was
then
exhibited
to
the
world
and
probably
to
this
we
may
accommodate
that
passage
of
peter
where
he
says
that
christ
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
who
were
keeping
watch
as
in
a
this
is
generally
rendered
the
spirits
in
prison
but
i
conceive
improperly
the
context
also
gives
us
to
understand
that
the
faithful
who
had
died
before
that
time
were
partakers
of
the
same
grace
with
us
for
the
apostle
amplifies
the
efficacy
of
the
death
of
christ
from
this
consideration
that
it
penetrated
even
to
the
dead
when
the
souls
of
the
faithful
enjoyed
the
present
view
of
that
visitation
which
they
had
been
anxiously
expecting
whilst
on
the
contrary
it
was
more
clearly
discovered
to
the
reprobate
that
they
were
excluded
from
all
salvation
but
since
peter
has
not
spoken
in
this
distinct
manner
of
the
pious
and
the
impious
we
must
not
understand
him
as
confounding
them
all
together
without
any
discrimination
he
only
designs
to
inform
us
that
the
knowledge
of
the
death
of
christ
was
common
to
them
both
x
but
laying
aside
all
consideration
of
the
creed
we
have
to
seek
for
a
more
certain
explanation
of
the
descent
of
christ
into
hell
and
we
find
one
in
the
divine
word
not
only
holy
and
pious
but
likewise
replete
with
singular
consolation
if
christ
had
merely
died
a
corporeal
death
no
end
would
have
been
accomplished
by
it
it
was
requisite
also
that
he
should
feel
the
severity
of
the
divine
vengeance
in
order
to
appease
the
wrath
of
god
and
satisfy
his
justice
hence
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
contend
with
the
powers
of
hell
and
the
horror
of
eternal
death
we
have
already
stated
from
the
prophet
that
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
that
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
and
bruised
for
our
iniquities
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
he
was
made
a
substitute
and
surety
for
transgressors
and
even
treated
as
a
criminal
himself
to
sustain
all
the
punishments
which
would
have
been
inflicted
on
them
only
with
this
exception
that
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
the
pains
of
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
if
he
be
said
to
have
descended
into
hell
since
he
suffered
that
death
which
the
wrath
of
god
inflicts
on
transgressors
it
is
a
very
frivolous
and
even
ridiculous
objection
to
say
that
by
this
explanation
the
order
of
things
is
perverted
because
it
is
absurd
to
make
that
subsequent
to
his
burial
which
really
preceded
it
for
the
relation
of
those
sufferings
of
christ
which
were
visible
to
men
is
very
properly
followed
by
that
invisible
and
incomprehensible
vengeance
which
he
suffered
from
the
hand
of
god
in
order
to
assure
us
that
not
only
the
body
of
christ
was
given
as
the
price
of
our
redemption
but
that
there
was
another
greater
and
more
excellent
ransom
since
he
suffered
in
his
soul
the
dreadful
torments
of
a
person
condemned
and
irretrievably
lost
xi
in
this
sense
peter
says
that
god
raised
him
up
having
loosed
the
pains
of
death
because
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
he
does
not
say
simply
death
but
tells
us
that
the
son
of
god
was
involved
in
the
pains
of
death
which
proceed
from
the
divine
wrath
and
malediction
which
is
the
origin
of
death
for
what
a
little
thing
it
would
have
been
for
christ
to
appear
in
order
to
suffer
death
without
any
distress
or
perplexity
and
even
with
pleasure
but
this
was
a
true
specimen
of
his
infinite
mercy
not
to
evade
that
death
which
he
so
much
dreaded
nor
can
it
be
doubted
but
the
apostle
means
to
suggest
the
same
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
when
he
says
that
christ
was
heard
in
that
he
some
instead
of
fear
translate
it
reverence
or
piety
but
how
improperly
is
evident
from
the
subject
itself
and
also
from
the
form
of
expression
christ
therefore
when
he
offered
up
prayers
with
strong
crying
and
tears
was
heard
in
that
he
feared
not
that
he
might
obtain
an
exemption
from
death
but
that
he
might
not
be
swallowed
up
by
it
as
a
sinner
for
he
was
then
sustaining
our
character
and
it
is
certainly
impossible
to
imagine
any
more
formidable
abyss
than
to
perceive
ourselves
forsaken
and
abandoned
by
god
and
not
to
be
heard
when
we
call
upon
him
as
though
he
had
conspired
to
destroy
us
now
we
see
christ
was
so
deeply
dejected
that
in
the
urgency
of
distress
he
was
constrained
to
exclaim
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
for
the
idea
of
some
that
he
spoke
rather
according
to
the
opinion
of
others
than
from
his
own
feelings
is
utterly
improbable
since
he
evidently
appears
to
have
spoken
from
the
anguish
of
his
inmost
soul
we
do
not
admit
that
god
was
ever
hostile
to
him
or
angry
with
him
for
how
could
he
be
angry
with
his
beloved
son
in
whom
his
soul
delighted
or
how
could
christ
by
his
intercession
appease
the
father
for
others
if
the
father
were
incensed
against
him
but
we
affirm
that
he
sustained
the
weight
of
the
divine
severity
since
being
smitten
and
afflicted
of
god
he
experienced
from
god
all
the
tokens
of
wrath
and
vengeance
wherefore
hilary
argues
that
by
this
descent
we
have
obtained
the
destruction
of
death
and
in
other
places
he
accords
with
our
opinion
as
when
he
says
the
cross
death
and
hell
are
our
again
in
another
place
the
son
of
god
is
in
hell
but
man
is
raised
to
but
why
do
i
cite
the
testimony
of
a
private
person
when
the
apostle
asserts
the
same
thing
mentioning
as
the
reward
of
christ
s
victory
the
deliverance
of
them
who
through
fear
of
death
were
all
their
lifetime
subject
to
bondage
it
was
necessary
therefore
that
he
should
overcome
that
fear
which
naturally
and
incessantly
harasses
all
men
which
he
could
not
do
without
contending
with
it
now
that
his
was
not
a
common
or
trivial
sorrow
will
soon
be
more
clearly
evinced
thus
by
contending
with
the
power
of
the
devil
with
the
dread
of
death
and
with
the
pains
of
hell
he
obtained
the
victory
and
triumphed
over
them
that
in
death
we
may
no
longer
dread
those
things
which
our
prince
has
destroyed
xii
here
some
contentious
though
illiterate
men
impelled
rather
by
malice
than
by
ignorance
exclaim
against
me
that
i
am
guilty
of
an
atrocious
injury
to
christ
because
it
is
utterly
unreasonable
that
he
should
have
any
fear
concerning
the
salvation
of
his
soul
and
then
they
aggravate
the
cavil
by
pretending
that
i
attribute
despair
to
the
son
of
god
which
is
contrary
to
faith
in
the
first
place
it
is
presumptuous
in
them
to
raise
a
controversy
concerning
the
fear
and
consternation
of
christ
which
is
so
expressly
asserted
by
the
evangelists
for
before
the
approach
of
his
death
he
experienced
a
perturbation
of
spirit
and
depression
of
mind
but
in
the
actual
struggle
with
it
he
began
to
feel
a
greater
degree
of
consternation
if
they
say
that
this
was
only
pretence
it
is
a
most
paltry
subterfuge
we
ought
therefore
as
ambrose
justly
advises
fearlessly
to
acknowledge
the
sorrow
of
christ
unless
we
are
ashamed
of
his
cross
and
indeed
if
his
soul
had
experienced
no
punishment
he
would
have
been
only
a
redeemer
for
the
body
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
combat
in
order
to
raise
up
those
who
lay
prostrate
on
the
earth
and
his
heavenly
glory
is
so
far
from
being
diminished
by
this
that
his
goodness
which
is
never
sufficiently
celebrated
is
conspicuous
in
his
voluntary
and
unreluctant
assumption
of
our
infirmities
hence
that
consolation
which
the
apostle
offers
us
under
our
anxieties
and
sorrows
that
this
mediator
has
experienced
our
infirmities
in
order
that
he
might
be
the
more
ready
to
succour
the
wretched
they
pretend
that
what
is
intrinsically
bad
can
not
be
justly
attributed
to
christ
as
though
they
were
wiser
than
the
spirit
of
god
who
connects
these
two
things
together
that
christ
was
in
all
points
tempted
like
as
we
are
yet
without
we
have
no
reason
therefore
to
be
alarmed
by
the
infirmity
of
christ
to
which
he
was
not
compelled
by
violence
or
necessity
but
induced
merely
by
his
mercy
and
love
for
us
voluntarily
to
submit
himself
but
none
of
his
voluntary
sufferings
for
us
have
been
any
diminution
of
his
power
these
captious
objectors
however
are
deceived
in
one
point
they
do
not
perceive
that
this
infirmity
in
christ
was
perfectly
free
from
every
stain
of
guilt
because
he
always
kept
himself
within
the
limits
of
obedience
for
because
no
moderation
can
be
discovered
in
the
corruption
of
our
nature
where
all
our
passions
transgress
all
bounds
with
impetuous
violence
they
erroneously
measure
the
son
of
god
by
this
standard
but
he
being
innocent
and
free
from
every
defect
all
his
affections
were
governed
by
a
moderation
which
admitted
of
no
excess
whence
it
was
very
possible
for
him
to
resemble
us
in
sorrow
fear
and
dread
and
yet
in
this
respect
to
be
very
different
from
us
refuted
here
they
proceed
to
another
cavil
that
although
christ
was
afraid
of
death
yet
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
malediction
and
wrath
of
god
from
which
he
knew
himself
to
be
safe
but
let
the
pious
reader
consider
how
much
honour
it
reflects
on
christ
that
he
was
more
delicate
and
timorous
than
the
generality
of
mankind
robbers
and
other
malefactors
obstinately
rush
forward
to
death
many
men
nobly
despise
it
others
calmly
submit
to
it
but
what
constancy
or
magnanimity
would
the
son
of
god
have
discovered
in
being
astonished
and
almost
struck
dead
with
the
fear
of
it
for
it
is
related
of
him
what
might
generally
be
accounted
a
prodigy
that
through
the
vehemence
of
his
agonies
drops
of
blood
flowed
from
his
face
nor
did
he
exhibit
this
spectacle
to
the
eyes
of
others
he
sent
up
his
groans
to
his
father
in
the
secrecy
of
retirement
and
every
doubt
is
removed
by
the
necessity
that
there
was
for
angels
to
descend
from
heaven
to
support
him
with
unusual
consolation
what
disgraceful
effeminacy
as
i
have
suggested
would
this
have
been
to
be
so
distressed
by
the
fear
of
a
common
death
as
to
be
in
a
bloody
sweat
and
incapable
of
being
comforted
without
the
presence
of
angels
what
does
not
this
prayer
which
he
repeated
three
times
o
my
father
if
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
proceeding
from
an
incredible
bitterness
of
soul
demonstrate
that
christ
had
a
more
severe
and
arduous
conflict
than
with
a
common
death
whence
it
appears
that
those
triflers
with
whom
i
am
now
disputing
presumptuously
chatter
about
things
which
they
know
not
because
they
never
seriously
considered
the
nature
or
the
importance
of
our
redemption
from
the
divine
judgment
but
it
is
our
wisdom
to
have
a
clear
understanding
how
much
our
salvation
cost
the
son
of
god
if
any
one
inquire
whether
christ
was
then
descending
to
hell
when
he
deprecated
death
i
reply
that
this
was
the
prelude
to
it
whence
we
may
conclude
what
dreadful
and
horrible
agonies
he
must
have
suffered
while
he
was
conscious
of
standing
at
the
tribunal
of
god
accused
as
a
criminal
on
our
account
but
although
the
divine
power
of
the
spirit
concealed
itself
for
a
moment
to
give
place
to
the
infirmity
of
the
flesh
yet
we
know
that
the
temptation
arising
from
a
sense
of
grief
and
fear
was
such
as
was
not
repugnant
to
faith
and
thus
was
fulfilled
what
we
find
in
the
sermon
of
peter
that
it
was
not
possible
that
he
should
be
holden
of
the
pains
of
death
because
when
he
perceived
himself
as
it
were
deserted
by
god
still
he
relaxed
not
in
the
least
from
his
confidence
in
his
father
s
goodness
this
is
evident
from
his
celebrated
invocation
when
through
the
vehemence
of
grief
he
exclaimed
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
for
notwithstanding
his
extreme
agony
yet
he
continues
to
call
god
god
even
when
he
complains
that
he
is
forsaken
by
him
now
this
serves
to
refute
the
error
of
apollinaris
and
also
of
those
who
were
called
monothelites
apollinaris
pretended
that
the
eternal
spirit
supplied
the
place
of
a
soul
in
christ
so
that
he
was
but
half
a
man
as
though
he
could
expiate
our
sins
without
obedience
to
the
father
but
where
was
the
disposition
or
will
requisite
to
obedience
but
in
his
soul
which
we
know
was
troubled
in
order
to
dissipate
all
our
fears
and
obtain
peace
and
rest
for
ours
moreover
in
opposition
to
the
monothelites
we
see
that
what
was
contrary
to
his
will
as
man
was
agreeable
to
his
will
as
god
i
say
nothing
of
his
overcoming
the
fear
of
which
we
have
spoken
by
a
contrary
disposition
for
there
is
a
manifest
appearance
of
contrariety
when
he
says
father
save
me
from
this
hour
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
hour
father
glorify
thy
yet
in
this
perplexity
there
is
no
such
want
of
moderation
as
is
evident
in
us
even
while
we
are
exerting
our
most
strenuous
endeavours
to
conquer
ourselves
xiii
next
follows
his
resurrection
from
the
dead
without
which
all
that
we
have
said
would
be
incomplete
for
since
there
appears
nothing
but
infirmity
in
the
cross
death
and
burial
of
christ
faith
must
proceed
beyond
all
these
things
to
be
furnished
with
sufficient
strength
wherefore
although
our
salvation
is
perfectly
accomplished
by
his
death
because
by
that
we
are
reconciled
to
god
a
satisfaction
is
given
to
his
righteous
judgment
the
curse
is
removed
and
the
punishment
sustained
yet
we
are
said
to
have
been
begotten
again
to
a
lively
hope
not
by
his
death
but
by
his
resurrection
from
the
for
as
at
his
resurrection
he
appeared
the
conqueror
of
death
so
it
is
on
his
resurrection
that
our
faith
principally
rests
this
is
better
expressed
in
the
words
of
paul
when
he
says
that
christ
was
delivered
for
our
offences
and
was
raised
again
for
our
justification
as
though
he
had
said
that
sin
was
removed
by
his
death
and
righteousness
renewed
and
restored
by
his
resurrection
for
how
was
it
possible
for
him
by
dying
to
liberate
us
from
death
if
he
had
himself
remained
under
its
power
how
could
he
have
obtained
the
victory
for
us
if
he
had
been
vanquished
in
the
contest
wherefore
we
ascribe
our
salvation
partly
to
the
death
of
christ
and
partly
to
his
resurrection
we
believe
that
sin
was
abolished
and
death
destroyed
by
the
former
that
righteousness
was
restored
and
life
established
by
the
latter
yet
so
that
the
former
discovers
its
power
and
efficacy
in
us
by
means
of
the
latter
therefore
paul
asserts
that
he
was
declared
to
be
the
son
of
god
by
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
because
he
then
displayed
his
heavenly
power
which
is
both
a
lucid
mirror
of
his
divinity
and
a
firm
support
of
our
faith
so
in
another
place
he
says
that
he
was
crucified
through
weakness
yet
he
liveth
by
the
power
of
in
the
same
sense
in
another
place
treating
of
perfection
he
says
that
i
may
know
him
and
the
power
of
his
yet
immediately
after
he
adds
the
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
and
conformity
to
his
in
perfect
harmony
with
this
is
the
following
declaration
of
peter
god
raised
him
up
from
the
dead
and
gave
him
glory
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
god
not
that
faith
totters
when
it
rests
on
his
death
but
because
the
power
of
god
which
keeps
us
through
faith
chiefly
discovers
itself
in
his
resurrection
let
us
remember
therefore
that
whenever
mention
is
made
of
his
death
alone
it
comprehends
also
what
strictly
belongs
to
his
resurrection
and
that
the
same
figure
of
speech
is
applied
to
the
word
whenever
it
is
used
without
any
mention
of
his
death
so
that
it
connects
with
it
what
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
his
death
but
since
it
was
by
rising
from
the
dead
that
he
obtained
the
palm
of
victory
to
become
the
resurrection
and
the
life
paul
justly
contends
that
if
christ
be
not
risen
then
is
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
vain
and
our
faith
is
also
therefore
in
another
place
after
having
gloried
in
the
death
of
christ
in
opposition
to
all
the
fears
of
condemnation
he
adds
by
way
of
amplification
yea
rather
that
is
risen
again
who
is
even
at
the
right
hand
of
god
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
besides
as
we
have
before
stated
that
the
mortification
of
our
flesh
depends
on
communion
with
his
cross
so
it
must
also
be
understood
that
we
obtain
another
benefit
corresponding
to
that
from
his
resurrection
the
apostle
says
if
we
have
been
planted
together
in
the
likeness
of
his
death
we
shall
be
also
in
the
likeness
of
his
resurrection
even
so
we
also
should
walk
in
newness
of
therefore
in
another
place
as
from
our
being
dead
with
christ
he
deduces
an
argument
for
the
mortification
of
our
members
which
are
upon
the
earth
so
also
because
we
are
risen
with
christ
he
thence
infers
that
we
should
seek
those
things
which
are
above
and
not
those
which
are
on
the
earth
by
which
expressions
we
are
not
only
invited
to
walk
in
newness
of
life
after
the
example
of
christ
raised
from
the
dead
but
are
taught
that
our
regeneration
to
righteousness
is
effected
by
his
power
we
derive
also
a
third
benefit
from
his
resurrection
having
received
as
it
were
a
pledge
to
assure
us
of
our
own
resurrection
of
which
his
clearly
affords
the
most
solid
foundation
and
evidence
this
subject
the
apostle
discusses
more
at
large
in
the
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
but
it
must
be
remarked
by
the
way
that
when
he
is
said
to
have
risen
from
the
dead
this
phrase
expresses
the
reality
both
of
his
death
and
of
his
resurrection
as
though
it
were
said
that
he
died
the
same
death
as
other
men
naturally
die
and
received
immortality
in
the
same
body
which
he
had
assumed
in
a
mortal
state
xiv
his
is
properly
followed
in
the
creed
by
his
to
for
though
christ
began
to
make
a
more
illustrious
display
of
his
glory
and
power
at
his
resurrection
having
now
laid
aside
the
abject
and
ignoble
condition
of
this
mortal
life
and
the
ignominy
of
the
cross
yet
his
ascension
into
heaven
was
the
real
commencement
of
his
reign
this
the
apostle
shows
when
he
informs
us
that
he
ascended
that
he
might
fill
all
here
in
an
apparent
contradiction
he
suggests
to
us
that
there
is
a
beautiful
harmony
because
christ
departed
from
us
that
his
departure
might
be
more
useful
to
us
than
that
presence
which
during
his
continuance
on
earth
confined
itself
within
the
humble
mansion
of
his
body
therefore
john
after
having
related
that
remarkable
invitation
if
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
me
and
drink
subjoins
that
the
holy
ghost
was
not
yet
given
because
that
jesus
was
not
yet
this
the
lord
himself
also
declared
to
his
disciples
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
away
for
if
i
go
not
away
the
comforter
will
not
come
unto
now
he
proposes
a
consolation
for
his
corporeal
absence
that
he
will
not
leave
them
comfortless
or
orphans
but
will
come
again
to
them
in
a
manner
invisible
indeed
but
more
desirable
because
they
were
then
taught
by
a
more
certain
experience
that
the
authority
which
he
enjoys
and
the
power
which
he
exercises
is
sufficient
for
the
faithful
not
only
to
procure
them
a
blessed
life
but
to
insure
them
a
happy
death
and
indeed
we
see
how
largely
he
then
increased
the
effusions
of
his
spirit
how
greatly
he
advanced
the
magnificence
of
his
reign
and
what
superior
power
he
exerted
both
in
assisting
his
friends
and
in
defeating
his
enemies
being
received
up
into
heaven
therefore
he
removed
his
corporeal
presence
from
our
view
not
that
he
might
no
longer
be
present
with
the
faithful
who
were
still
in
a
state
of
pilgrimage
on
earth
but
that
he
might
govern
both
heaven
and
earth
by
a
more
efficacious
energy
moreover
his
promise
that
he
would
be
with
us
till
the
end
of
the
world
he
has
performed
by
this
his
ascension
by
which
as
his
body
was
elevated
above
all
heavens
so
his
power
and
energy
have
been
diffused
and
extended
beyond
all
the
limits
of
heaven
and
earth
in
representing
this
i
would
prefer
the
language
of
augustine
to
my
own
christ
says
he
was
about
to
go
by
death
to
the
right
hand
of
the
father
whence
he
will
hereafter
come
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
and
this
by
a
corporeal
presence
according
to
the
rule
of
faith
and
sound
doctrine
for
in
his
spiritual
presence
with
them
he
was
to
come
soon
after
his
and
elsewhere
he
treats
this
subject
in
a
manner
still
more
diffuse
and
explicit
by
his
ineffable
and
invisible
grace
christ
has
fulfilled
his
declaration
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end
of
the
but
with
respect
to
the
body
which
the
word
assumed
which
was
born
of
the
virgin
which
was
apprehended
by
the
jews
which
was
fixed
to
the
cross
which
was
taken
down
from
the
cross
which
was
folded
in
linen
which
was
laid
in
the
sepulchre
which
was
manifested
at
the
resurrection
there
has
been
an
accomplishment
of
this
prediction
ye
shall
not
have
me
always
with
why
because
in
his
corporeal
presence
he
conversed
with
his
disciples
for
forty
days
and
while
they
were
attending
him
seen
but
not
followed
by
them
he
ascended
into
heaven
and
he
is
not
here
for
he
sits
there
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
and
yet
he
is
here
for
he
has
not
withdrawn
the
presence
of
his
majesty
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
therefore
we
have
christ
always
with
us
but
with
respect
to
his
corporeal
presence
he
said
with
truth
to
his
disciples
me
ye
have
not
for
the
church
enjoyed
his
corporeal
presence
for
a
few
days
now
she
enjoys
him
by
faith
and
does
not
behold
him
with
her
eyes
xv
wherefore
it
is
immediately
added
he
is
seated
at
the
right
hand
of
the
which
is
a
similitude
borrowed
from
princes
who
have
their
assistants
to
whom
they
depute
the
exercise
of
the
government
so
christ
in
whom
the
father
determines
to
be
exalted
and
by
whose
medium
he
chooses
to
reign
is
said
to
have
been
received
to
his
right
hand
as
though
it
were
said
that
he
had
been
inaugurated
in
the
government
of
heaven
and
earth
and
had
solemnly
entered
on
the
actual
administration
of
the
power
committed
to
him
and
not
only
that
he
has
entered
on
it
but
that
he
continues
in
it
till
he
descends
to
judgment
for
so
the
apostle
explains
it
in
the
following
words
the
father
hath
set
him
at
his
own
right
hand
far
above
all
principality
and
power
and
might
and
dominion
and
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
world
but
also
in
that
which
is
to
come
and
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
and
gave
him
to
be
the
head
over
all
things
to
the
church
we
see
the
end
of
this
session
it
is
that
all
creatures
both
celestial
and
terrestrial
may
admire
his
majesty
be
governed
by
his
hand
obey
his
will
and
be
subject
to
his
power
and
the
only
design
of
the
apostles
in
their
frequent
mention
of
it
is
to
teach
us
that
all
things
are
committed
to
his
government
wherefore
they
who
suppose
that
nothing
but
blessedness
is
signified
in
this
article
are
not
right
in
that
opinion
it
affects
not
our
argument
that
stephen
declares
that
he
sees
christ
standing
because
the
present
question
relates
not
to
the
posture
of
his
body
but
to
the
majesty
of
his
dominion
so
that
signifies
no
other
than
presiding
at
the
tribunal
of
heaven
xvi
hence
faith
receives
many
advantages
for
it
perceives
that
by
his
ascension
the
lord
has
opened
the
way
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
which
had
been
stopped
by
adam
for
since
he
entered
there
in
our
nature
and
as
it
were
in
our
names
it
follows
that
as
the
apostle
expresses
it
we
now
sit
together
with
him
in
heavenly
places
because
we
not
only
hope
for
heaven
but
already
possess
it
in
our
head
besides
faith
knows
that
his
residence
with
his
father
conduces
greatly
to
our
advantage
for
being
entered
into
a
sanctuary
which
is
not
of
human
erection
he
continually
appears
in
the
presence
of
the
father
as
our
advocate
and
intercessor
he
attracts
the
eyes
of
the
father
to
his
righteousness
so
as
to
avert
them
from
our
sins
he
reconciles
him
to
us
so
as
to
procure
for
us
by
his
intercession
a
way
of
access
to
his
throne
which
he
replenishes
with
grace
and
mercy
but
which
otherwise
would
be
pregnant
with
horror
to
miserable
sinners
in
the
third
place
faith
has
an
apprehension
of
his
power
in
which
consists
our
strength
our
fortitude
our
wealth
and
our
triumph
over
hell
for
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
spoiled
his
enemies
and
enriched
his
people
and
daily
loads
them
with
spiritual
favours
he
sits
therefore
on
high
that
from
thence
he
may
shed
forth
his
power
upon
us
that
he
may
animate
us
with
spiritual
life
that
he
may
sanctify
us
by
his
spirit
that
he
may
adorn
his
church
with
a
variety
of
graces
and
defend
it
by
his
protection
from
every
calamity
that
by
the
strength
of
his
hand
he
may
restrain
the
ferocious
enemies
of
his
cross
and
of
our
salvation
finally
that
he
may
retain
all
power
in
heaven
and
in
earth
till
he
shall
have
overthrown
all
his
enemies
who
are
also
ours
and
completed
the
edification
of
his
church
and
this
is
the
true
state
of
his
kingdom
this
the
power
which
the
father
has
conferred
on
him
till
he
completes
the
last
act
by
coming
to
judge
the
living
and
the
dead
xvii
christ
gives
his
servants
unequivocal
tokens
of
the
presence
of
his
power
but
because
on
earth
his
kingdom
is
in
some
measure
concealed
under
the
meanness
of
the
flesh
faith
is
for
a
very
good
reason
called
to
meditate
on
that
visible
presence
which
he
will
manifest
at
the
last
day
for
he
will
descend
from
heaven
in
a
visible
form
in
the
same
manner
in
which
he
was
seen
to
ascend
and
will
appear
to
all
with
the
ineffable
majesty
of
his
kingdom
with
the
splendour
of
immortality
with
the
infinite
power
of
deity
and
with
a
host
of
angels
from
thence
therefore
we
are
commanded
to
expect
him
as
our
redeemer
at
the
last
day
when
he
will
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
the
elect
from
the
reprobate
and
there
will
not
be
an
individual
of
either
the
living
or
the
dead
that
can
escape
his
judgment
for
from
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
world
they
will
hear
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
with
which
all
mankind
will
be
summoned
to
his
tribunal
both
those
whom
that
day
shall
find
alive
and
those
whom
death
shall
previously
have
removed
from
the
society
of
the
living
there
are
some
who
understand
the
words
or
and
in
a
different
sense
and
indeed
we
find
that
some
of
the
fathers
hesitated
respecting
the
exposition
of
this
clause
but
the
sense
we
have
given
being
plain
and
clear
is
far
more
consistent
with
the
design
of
the
creed
which
appears
to
have
been
composed
for
the
common
people
nor
is
this
repugnant
to
the
assertion
of
the
apostle
that
it
is
appointed
unto
men
once
to
for
although
they
who
shall
survive
in
this
mortal
life
till
the
last
judgment
shall
not
die
in
a
natural
manner
and
order
yet
that
change
which
they
shall
experience
since
it
will
resemble
death
may
without
impropriety
be
designated
by
that
appellation
it
is
certain
indeed
that
all
shall
not
sleep
but
all
shall
be
what
is
that
in
one
moment
their
mortal
life
will
be
extinguished
and
absorbed
and
will
be
transformed
into
a
nature
entirely
new
this
extinction
of
the
flesh
no
man
can
deny
to
be
death
nevertheless
it
remains
a
truth
that
the
living
and
the
dead
will
be
summoned
to
judgment
for
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
then
they
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
and
it
is
very
probable
that
this
article
was
taken
from
the
sermon
of
peter
and
from
the
solemn
charge
of
paul
to
timothy
xviii
it
is
a
source
of
peculiar
consolation
to
hear
that
he
will
preside
at
the
judgment
who
has
already
destined
us
to
participate
with
himself
the
honour
of
sitting
in
judgment
with
him
so
far
will
he
be
from
ascending
the
tribunal
to
condemn
us
for
how
could
a
most
merciful
prince
destroy
his
own
people
how
could
a
head
scatter
his
own
members
how
could
an
advocate
condemn
his
own
clients
for
if
the
apostle
ventures
to
exclaim
that
no
one
can
condemn
us
while
christ
intercedes
for
us
it
is
much
more
certain
that
christ
himself
our
intercessor
will
not
condemn
those
whose
cause
he
has
undertaken
and
whom
he
has
engaged
to
support
indeed
it
is
no
inconsiderable
security
that
we
shall
stand
before
no
other
tribunal
than
that
of
our
redeemer
from
whom
we
are
to
expect
salvation
and
that
he
who
by
the
gospel
now
promises
eternal
life
will
at
the
judgment
ratify
and
perform
the
promise
which
he
has
given
the
design
of
the
father
in
honouring
the
son
by
committing
all
judgment
to
him
was
that
he
might
relieve
the
consciences
of
his
people
from
all
fear
concerning
the
judgment
thus
far
i
have
followed
the
order
of
the
apostles
creed
because
while
it
comprises
in
a
few
words
the
principal
points
of
redemption
it
may
serve
to
give
us
a
distinct
and
separate
view
of
those
particulars
respecting
christ
which
merit
our
attention
i
style
it
the
apostles
creed
but
am
not
at
all
solicitous
to
know
who
was
the
composer
of
it
the
ancient
writers
agree
in
ascribing
it
to
the
apostles
either
from
a
belief
that
it
was
written
and
published
by
their
common
concurrence
or
from
an
opinion
that
this
compendium
being
faithfully
collected
from
the
doctrine
delivered
by
them
was
worthy
of
being
sanctioned
by
such
a
title
and
whoever
was
the
author
of
it
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
has
been
publicly
and
universally
received
as
a
confession
of
faith
from
the
first
origin
of
the
church
and
even
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
nor
is
it
probable
that
it
was
composed
by
any
private
individual
since
from
time
immemorial
it
has
evidently
been
esteemed
as
of
sacred
authority
by
all
the
pious
but
what
we
ought
principally
to
regard
is
beyond
all
it
comprehends
a
complete
account
of
our
faith
in
a
concise
and
distinct
order
and
that
every
thing
it
contains
is
confirmed
by
decisive
testimonies
of
scripture
this
being
ascertained
it
is
of
no
use
anxiously
to
inquire
or
to
contend
with
any
one
respecting
its
author
unless
it
be
not
sufficient
for
any
one
to
have
the
unerring
truth
of
the
holy
spirit
without
knowing
either
by
whose
mouth
it
was
uttered
or
by
whose
hand
it
was
written
xix
since
we
see
that
the
whole
of
our
salvation
and
all
the
branches
of
it
are
comprehended
in
christ
we
must
be
cautious
not
to
alienate
from
him
the
least
possible
portion
of
it
if
we
seek
salvation
we
are
taught
by
the
name
of
jesus
that
it
is
in
him
if
we
seek
any
other
gifts
of
the
spirit
they
will
be
found
in
his
unction
strength
in
his
dominion
purity
in
his
conception
indulgence
discovers
itself
in
his
nativity
by
which
he
was
made
to
resemble
us
in
all
things
that
he
might
learn
to
condole
with
us
if
we
seek
redemption
it
will
be
found
in
his
passion
absolution
in
his
condemnation
remission
of
the
curse
in
his
cross
satisfaction
in
his
sacrifice
purification
in
his
blood
reconciliation
in
his
descent
into
hell
mortification
of
the
flesh
in
his
sepulchre

and
immortality

and
enjoyment

fearless
expectation
of
the
judgment

the
judicial
authority
committed
to
him
finally
blessings
of
every
kind
are
deposited
in
him
let
us
draw
from
his
treasury
and
from
no
other
source
till
our
desires
are
satisfied
for
they
who
not
content
with
him
alone
are
carried
hither
and
thither
into
a
variety
of
hopes
although
they
fix
their
eyes
principally
on
him
nevertheless
deviate
from
the
right
way
in
the
diversion
of
any
part
of
their
attention
to
another
quarter
this
distrust
however
can
not
intrude
where
the
plenitude
of
his
blessings
has
once
been
truly
known
chapter
xvii
christ
truly
and
properly
said
to
have
merited
the
grace
of
god
and
salvation
for
us
we
must
devote
an
additional
chapter
to
the
solution
of
this
question
for
there
are
some
men
more
subtle
than
orthodox
who
though
they
confess
that
christ
obtained
salvation
for
us
yet
can
not
bear
the
word
by
which
they
suppose
the
grace
of
god
is
obscured
so
they
maintain
that
christ
is
only
the
instrument
or
minister
not
as
he
is
called
by
peter
the
author
or
leader
and
prince
of
i
grant
indeed
if
any
man
would
oppose
christ
simply
and
alone
to
the
judgment
of
god
there
would
be
no
room
for
merit
because
it
is
impossible
to
find
in
man
any
excellence
which
can
merit
the
favour
of
god
nay
as
augustine
most
truly
observes
the
brightest
illustration
of
predestination
and
grace
is
the
saviour
himself
the
man
christ
jesus
who
has
acquired
this
character
in
his
human
nature
without
any
previous
merit
either
of
works
or
of
faith
let
any
one
tell
me
how
that
man
merited
the
honour
of
being
assumed
into
one
person
with
the
word
who
is
coëternal
with
the
father
and
so
becoming
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
thus
the
fountain
of
grace
appears
in
our
head
and
from
him
diffuses
its
streams
through
all
his
members
according
to
their
respective
capacities
every
one
from
the
commencement
of
his
faith
is
made
a
christian
by
the
same
grace
by
which
this
man
from
the
commencement
of
his
existence
was
made
the
again
in
another
treatise
augustine
says
there
is
not
a
more
illustrious
example
of
predestination
than
the
mediator
himself
for
he
who
made
of
the
seed
of
david
this
righteous
man
so
that
he
never
was
unrighteous
without
any
previous
merit
of
his
will
converts
unrighteous
persons
into
righteous
ones
and
makes
them
members
of
that
head
when
we
speak
of
the
merit
of
christ
therefore
we
do
not
consider
him
as
the
origin
of
it
but
we
ascend
to
the
ordination
of
god
which
is
the
first
cause
because
it
was
of
his
mere
good
pleasure
that
god
appointed
him
mediator
to
procure
salvation
for
us
and
thus
it
betrays
ignorance
to
oppose
the
merit
of
christ
to
the
mercy
of
god
for
it
is
a
common
maxim
that
between
two
things
of
which
one
succeeds
or
is
subordinate
to
the
other
there
can
be
no
opposition
there
is
no
reason
therefore
why
the
justification
of
men
should
not
be
gratuitous
from
the
mere
mercy
of
god
and
why
at
the
same
time
the
merit
of
christ
should
not
intervene
which
is
subservient
to
the
mercy
of
god
but
to
our
works
are
directly
and
equally
opposed
the
gratuitous
favour
of
god
and
the
obedience
of
christ
each
in
its
respective
place
for
christ
could
merit
nothing
except
by
the
good
pleasure
of
god
by
which
he
had
been
predestinated
to
appease
the
divine
wrath
by
his
sacrifice
and
to
abolish
our
transgressions
by
his
obedience
to
conclude
since
the
merit
of
christ
depends
solely
on
the
grace
of
god
which
appointed
this
method
of
salvation
for
us
therefore
his
merit
and
that
grace
are
with
equal
propriety
opposed
to
all
the
righteousnesses
of
men
ii
this
distinction
is
gathered
from
numerous
passages
of
scripture
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
we
see
that
the
love
of
god
holds
the
first
place
as
the
supreme
and
original
cause
and
that
faith
in
christ
follows
as
the
second
and
proximate
cause
if
it
be
objected
that
christ
is
only
the
formal
cause
this
diminishes
his
merit
more
than
the
words
now
quoted
will
bear
for
if
we
obtain
righteousness
by
a
faith
which
relies
on
him
it
is
in
him
we
are
to
seek
the
cause
of
our
salvation
this
is
evident
from
many
passages
not
that
we
loved
god
but
that
he
loved
us
and
sent
his
son
to
be
the
propitiation
for
our
these
words
clearly
demonstrate
that
to
remove
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
love
towards
us
god
appointed
a
method
of
reconciliation
in
christ
and
there
is
much
contained
in
the
word
propitiation
for
god
in
a
certain
ineffable
manner
at
the
same
time
that
he
loved
us
was
nevertheless
angry
with
us
till
he
was
reconciled
in
christ
this
is
implied
in
the
following
passages
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
again
it
pleased
the
father
having
made
peace
through
the
blood
of
his
cross
by
him
to
reconcile
all
things
unto
again
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
again
he
hath
made
us
accepted
in
the
again
that
he
might
reconcile
both
unto
god
in
one
body
by
the
the
reason
of
this
mystery
may
be
learned
from
the
first
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
ephesians
where
paul
having
taught
that
we
are
chosen
in
christ
adds
at
the
same
time
that
we
are
accepted
in
him
how
did
god
begin
to
favour
those
whom
he
had
loved
before
the
creation
of
the
world
but
by
the
manifestation
which
he
made
of
his
love
when
he
was
reconciled
by
the
blood
of
christ
for
since
god
is
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
he
must
necessarily
be
the
enemy
and
judge
of
every
sinner
wherefore
the
beginning
of
his
love
is
the
righteousness
described
by
paul
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
may
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
for
his
meaning
is
that
by
the
sacrifice
of
christ
we
obtain
gratuitous
righteousness
so
as
to
be
acceptable
to
god
though
by
nature
we
are
the
children
of
wrath
and
alienated
from
him
by
sin
this
distinction
is
indicated
also
wherever
the
grace
of
christ
is
connected
with
the
love
of
god
whence
it
follows
that
our
saviour
bestows
on
us
what
he
has
purchased
for
otherwise
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
ascribe
this
praise
to
him
distinctly
from
the
father
that
grace
is
his
and
proceeds
from
him
iii
now
that
christ
by
his
obedience
has
really
procured
and
merited
grace
from
the
father
for
us
is
certainly
and
justly
concluded
from
various
passages
of
scripture
for
i
assume
this
as
granted
if
christ
has
satisfied
for
our
sins
if
he
has
sustained
the
punishment
due
to
us
if
he
has
appeased
god
by
his
obedience
in
a
word
if
he
has
suffered
the
just
for
the
unjust
salvation
has
been
obtained
for
us
by
his
righteousness
which
is
the
same
as
being
merited
but
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
we
were
reconciled
by
his
death
by
whom
we
have
received
the
atonement
or
reconciliation
now
there
is
no
room
for
reconciliation
without
a
previous
offence
the
sense
therefore
is
that
god
to
whom
our
sins
had
rendered
us
odious
has
been
appeased
by
the
death
of
his
son
so
as
to
be
propitious
to
us
and
the
antithesis
which
follows
just
after
is
worthy
of
careful
observation
as
by
one
man
s
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
for
the
meaning
is
that
as
by
the
sin
of
adam
we
were
alienated
from
god
and
devoted
to
destruction
so
by
the
obedience
of
christ
we
are
received
into
favour
as
righteous
persons
nor
does
the
future
tense
of
the
verb
exclude
present
righteousness
as
appears
from
the
context
for
he
had
before
said
the
free
gift
is
of
many
offences
unto
iv
but
when
we
say
that
grace
is
procured
for
us
by
the
merit
of
christ
we
intend
that
we
have
been
purified
by
his
blood
and
that
his
death
was
an
expiation
for
sins
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
cleanseth
us
from
all
this
blood
is
shed
for
the
remission
of
if
the
of
our
sins
to
us
be
the
effect
of
the
blood
which
he
shed
it
follows
that
this
was
the
price
of
satisfaction
to
the
justice
of
god
this
is
confirmed
by
the
declaration
of
the
baptist
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
for
he
opposes
christ
to
all
the
sacrifices
of
the
law
to
show
that
what
they
prefigured
was
accomplished
in
him
alone
now
we
know
what
moses
frequently
an
atonement
shall
be
made
for
sin
and
it
shall
be
forgiven
in
short
the
ancient
figures
give
us
a
fine
exhibition
of
the
power
and
efficacy
of
the
death
of
christ
and
the
apostle
copiously
discusses
this
subject
in
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
judiciously
assuming
this
as
a
fundamental
principle
that
without
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
whence
he
infers
that
christ
has
once
appeared
to
put
away
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
himself
and
that
he
was
offered
to
bear
the
sins
of
he
had
already
said
that
not
by
the
blood
of
goats
and
calves
but
by
his
own
blood
he
entered
once
into
the
holy
place
having
obtained
eternal
now
when
he
argues
in
this
manner
if
the
blood
of
bulls
and
of
goats
and
the
ashes
of
a
heifer
sprinkling
the
unclean
sanctifieth
to
the
purifying
of
the
flesh
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
christ
purge
your
conscience
from
dead
works
it
evidently
appears
that
we
too
much
undervalue
the
grace
of
christ
unless
we
attribute
to
his
sacrifice
an
expiatory
placatory
and
satisfactory
efficacy
therefore
it
is
immediately
added
he
is
the
mediator
of
the
new
testament
that
by
means
of
death
for
the
redemption
of
the
transgressions
that
were
under
the
first
testament
they
which
are
called
might
receive
the
promise
of
eternal
but
we
ought
particularly
to
consider
the
relation
described
by
paul
that
he
was
made
a
curse
for
for
it
would
be
unnecessary
and
consequently
absurd
for
christ
to
be
loaded
with
a
curse
except
in
order
to
discharge
the
debts
due
from
others
and
thereby
to
obtain
a
righteousness
for
them
the
testimony
of
isaiah
likewise
is
clear
that
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
for
if
christ
had
not
made
a
satisfaction
for
our
sins
he
could
not
be
said
to
have
appeased
god
by
suffering
the
punishment
to
which
we
were
exposed
this
is
confirmed
by
a
subsequent
clause
for
the
transgression
of
my
people
was
he
let
us
add
the
interpretation
of
peter
which
will
remove
all
difficulty
that
he
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
which
imports
that
the
burden
of
condemnation
from
which
we
have
been
relieved
was
laid
upon
christ
the
apostles
explicitly
declare
that
he
paid
a
price
to
redeem
us
from
the
sentence
of
death
being
justified
freely
by
his
grace
through
the
redemption
that
is
in
christ
jesus
whom
god
hath
set
forth
to
be
a
propitiation
through
faith
in
his
here
paul
celebrates
the
grace
of
god
because
he
has
given
the
price
of
our
redemption
in
the
death
of
christ
and
then
enjoins
us
to
betake
ourselves
to
his
blood
that
we
may
obtain
righteousness
and
may
stand
secure
before
the
judgment
of
god
peter
confirms
the
same
when
he
says
ye
were
not
redeemed
with
corruptible
things
as
silver
and
gold
but
with
the
precious
blood
of
christ
as
of
a
lamb
without
blemish
and
without
for
there
would
be
no
propriety
in
the
comparison
unless
this
blood
had
been
the
price
of
satisfaction
for
sin
for
which
reason
paul
says
ye
are
bought
with
a
nor
would
there
be
any
truth
in
his
other
assertion
that
there
is
one
mediator
who
gave
himself
a
ransom
unless
the
punishment
due
to
our
demerits
had
been
transferred
to
him
therefore
the
same
apostle
defines
redemption
through
his
blood
to
be
the
forgiveness
of
sins
as
though
he
had
said
we
are
justified
or
acquitted
before
god
because
that
blood
is
a
complete
satisfaction
for
us
this
is
consonant
with
the
following
passage
that
he
blotted
out
the
writing
which
was
contrary
to
us
nailing
it
to
his
for
these
words
signify
the
payment
or
compensation
which
absolves
us
from
guilt
there
is
great
weight
also
in
these
words
of
paul
if
righteousness
come
by
the
law
then
christ
is
dead
in
for
hence
we
conclude
that
we
must
seek
from
christ
what
the
law
would
confer
upon
any
one
who
fulfilled
it
or
which
is
the
same
that
we
obtain
by
the
grace
of
christ
what
god
promised
in
the
law
to
our
works
which
commandments
if
a
man
do
he
shall
live
in
this
the
apostle
confirms
with
equal
perspicuity
in
his
sermon
at
antioch
asserting
that
by
christ
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
they
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
for
if
righteousness
consist
in
an
observance
of
the
law
who
can
deny
that
christ
merited
favour
for
us
when
by
bearing
this
burden
himself
he
reconciles
us
to
god
just
as
though
we
were
complete
observers
of
the
law
ourselves
the
same
idea
is
conveyed
in
what
he
afterwards
writes
to
the
galatians
that
god
sent
forth
his
son
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
for
what
was
the
design
of
that
subjection
to
the
law
but
to
procure
a
righteousness
for
us
by
undertaking
to
perform
that
which
we
were
not
able
to
do
hence
that
imputation
of
righteousness
without
works
of
which
paul
treats
because
that
righteousness
which
is
found
in
christ
alone
is
accepted
as
ours
nor
indeed
is
the
flesh
of
christ
called
our
food
for
any
other
reason
but
because
we
find
in
it
the
substance
of
life
now
this
virtue
proceeds
solely
from
the
crucifixion
of
the
son
of
god
as
the
price
of
our
righteousness
thus
paul
says
christ
hath
given
himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
god
for
a
and
in
another
place
he
was
delivered
for
our
offences
and
was
raised
again
for
our
hence
it
is
inferred
not
only
that
salvation
is
given
us
through
christ
but
that
the
father
is
now
propitious
to
us
for
his
sake
for
it
can
not
be
doubted
but
this
which
god
declares
in
a
figurative
way
by
isaiah
is
perfectly
fulfilled
in
him
i
will
do
it
for
mine
own
sake
and
for
my
servant
david
s
of
this
the
apostle
is
a
sufficient
witness
when
he
says
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
for
his
name
s
for
although
the
name
of
christ
is
not
expressed
yet
john
in
his
usual
manner
designates
him
by
the
pronoun
αὐτος
in
this
sense
the
lord
declares
as
i
live
by
the
father
so
he
that
eateth
me
even
he
shall
live
by
with
which
corresponds
the
following
declaration
of
paul
unto
you
it
is
given
for
the
love
of
christ
ὑπερ
χριστου
not
only
to
believe
on
him
but
also
to
suffer
for
his
vi
but
the
inquiry
made
by
lombard
and
the
schoolmen
whether
christ
merited
for
himself
discovers
as
much
foolish
curiosity
as
the
assertion
does
presumption
when
they
affirm
it
for
what
necessity
was
there
for
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
to
descend
in
order
to
make
any
new
acquisition
for
himself
and
god
by
the
publication
of
his
own
counsel
removes
every
doubt
for
it
is
said
not
that
the
father
consulted
the
benefit
of
the
son
in
his
merits
but
that
he
delivered
him
to
death
and
spared
him
not
because
he
loved
the
and
the
language
of
the
prophets
is
worthy
of
observation
unto
us
a
child
is
again
rejoice
greatly
o
daughter
of
zion
behold
thy
king
cometh
unto
there
would
otherwise
be
no
force
in
that
confirmation
of
his
love
which
paul
celebrates
that
he
died
for
us
while
we
were
for
we
infer
from
this
that
he
had
no
regard
to
himself
and
this
he
clearly
affirms
himself
when
he
says
for
their
sakes
i
sanctify
for
by
transferring
the
benefit
of
his
sanctity
to
others
he
declares
that
he
makes
no
acquisition
for
himself
and
it
is
highly
worthy
of
our
observation
that
in
order
to
devote
himself
wholly
to
our
salvation
christ
in
a
manner
forgot
himself
to
support
this
notion
of
theirs
the
schoolmen
preposterously
pervert
the
following
passage
of
paul
wherefore
also
god
hath
highly
exalted
him
and
given
him
a
name
which
is
above
every
for
considered
as
a
man
by
what
merits
could
he
obtain
such
dignity
as
to
be
the
judge
of
the
world
and
the
head
of
angels
to
enjoy
the
supreme
dominion
of
god
and
to
be
the
residence
of
that
majesty
the
thousandth
part
of
which
can
never
be
approached
by
all
the
abilities
of
men
and
of
angels
but
the
solution
is
easy
and
complete
that
paul
in
that
passage
is
not
treating
of
the
cause
of
the
exaltation
of
christ
but
only
showing
the
consequence
of
it
that
he
might
be
an
example
to
us
nor
did
he
mean
any
other
than
what
is
declared
in
another
place
that
christ
ought
to
have
suffered
and
to
enter
into
his
book
iii
on
the
manner
of
receiving
the
grace
of
christ
the
benefits
which
we
derive
from
it
and
the
effects
which
follow
it
argument
the
two
former
books
relate
to
god
the
creator
and
redeemer
this
treats
of
god
the
sanctifier
or
of
the
operations
of
the
holy
spirit
towards
our
salvation
being
an
accurate
exposition
of
the
third
part
of
the
apostles
creed
the
principal
topics
of
this
are
seven
relating
chiefly
to
one
object
the
doctrine
of
faith
first
since
our
enjoyment
of
christ
and
all
his
benefits
depends
on
the
secret
and
special
operation
of
the
holy
spirit
it
discusses
this
operation
which
is
the
foundation
of
faith
of
newness
of
life
and
of
all
holy
secondly
faith
being
as
it
were
the
hand
by
which
we
embrace
christ
the
redeemer
as
offered
to
us
by
the
holy
spirit
it
next
adds
a
complete
description
of
ii
thirdly
to
improve
our
knowledge
of
this
salutary
faith
it
proceeds
to
show
the
effects
which
necessarily
result
from
it
and
contends
that
true
penitence
is
always
the
consequence
of
true
faith
but
first
it
proposes
the
doctrine
of
repentance
in
iii
and
then
treats
of
popish
penance
and
its
constituent
indulgences
and
purgatorial
but
institutes
a
particular
discussion
of
the
two
branches
of
true
penitence
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
and
the
vivification
of
the
spirit
or
the
life
of
a
christian
which
is
excellently
vi
vii
viii
ix
fourthly
in
order
to
a
clearer
display
of
the
advantages
and
consequences
of
this
faith
it
first
treats
of
justification
by
explains
the
questions
which
arise
from
xii
xiii
xiv
xv
xvi
xvii
lastly
proceeds
to
a
dissertation
on
christian
liberty
which
is
an
appendage
to
xix
fifthly
next
follows
prayer
the
principal
exercise
of
faith
and
the
medium
or
instrument
by
which
we
daily
receive
blessings
from
xx
sixthly
but
since
the
communication
of
christ
offered
in
the
gospel
is
not
embraced
by
men
in
general
but
only
by
those
whom
the
lord
has
favoured
with
the
efficacy
and
peculiar
grace
of
his
spirit
it
obviates
any
supposition
of
absurdity
by
subjoining
a
necessary
and
appropriate
dissertation
on
the
doctrine
of
divine
xxi
xxii
xxiii
xxiv
lastly
since
we
are
liable
to
various
difficulties
and
troubles
while
exercised
in
the
severe
warfare
which
always
attends
the
life
of
a
christian
it
contends
that
this
may
be
alleviated
by
meditating
on
the
final
resurrection
and
therefore
adds
a
discourse
on
that
xxv
chapter
i
what
is
declared
concerning
christ
rendered
profitable
to
us
by
the
secret
operation
of
the
spirit
we
are
now
to
examine
how
we
obtain
the
enjoyment
of
those
blessings
which
the
father
has
conferred
on
his
only
begotten
son
not
for
his
own
private
use
but
to
enrich
the
poor
and
needy
and
first
it
must
be
remarked
that
as
long
as
there
is
a
separation
between
christ
and
us
all
that
he
suffered
and
performed
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
is
useless
and
unavailing
to
us
to
communicate
to
us
what
he
received
from
his
father
he
must
therefore
become
ours
and
dwell
within
us
on
this
account
he
is
called
our
head
and
the
among
many
brethren
and
we
on
the
other
hand
are
said
to
be
grafted
into
him
and
to
put
him
on
for
as
i
have
observed
whatever
he
possesses
is
nothing
to
us
till
we
are
united
to
him
but
though
it
be
true
that
we
obtain
this
by
faith
yet
since
we
see
that
the
communication
of
christ
offered
in
the
gospel
is
not
promiscuously
embraced
by
all
reason
itself
teaches
us
to
proceed
further
and
to
inquire
into
the
secret
energy
of
the
spirit
by
which
we
are
introduced
to
the
enjoyment
of
christ
and
all
his
benefits
i
have
already
treated
of
the
eternal
deity
and
essence
of
the
spirit
let
us
now
confine
ourselves
to
this
particular
point
christ
came
thus
by
water
and
blood
that
the
spirit
may
testify
concerning
him
in
order
that
the
salvation
procured
by
him
may
not
be
lost
to
us
for
as
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
heaven
the
father
the
word
and
the
spirit
so
also
there
are
three
on
earth
the
spirit
the
water
and
the
nor
is
this
a
useless
repetition
of
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
which
we
perceive
to
be
engraven
like
a
seal
on
our
hearts
so
that
it
seals
the
ablution
and
sacrifice
of
christ
for
which
reason
peter
also
says
that
believers
are
elect
through
sanctification
of
the
spirit
unto
obedience
and
sprinkling
of
the
blood
of
jesus
this
passage
suggests
to
us
that
our
souls
are
purified
by
the
secret
ablution
of
the
spirit
that
the
effusion
of
that
sacred
blood
may
not
be
in
vain
for
the
same
reason
also
paul
when
speaking
of
purification
and
justification
says
we
enjoy
both
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
by
the
spirit
of
our
the
sum
of
all
is
the
holy
spirit
is
the
bond
by
which
christ
efficaciously
unites
us
to
himself
and
what
we
have
advanced
in
the
last
book
concerning
his
unction
tends
to
establish
the
same
truth
ii
but
as
a
further
confirmation
of
this
point
which
is
highly
worthy
of
being
understood
we
must
remember
that
christ
was
endued
with
the
holy
spirit
in
a
peculiar
manner
in
order
to
separate
us
from
the
world
and
introduce
us
into
the
hope
of
an
eternal
inheritance
hence
the
spirit
is
called
the
spirit
of
holiness
not
only
because
he
animates
and
supports
us
by
that
general
power
which
is
displayed
in
mankind
and
in
all
other
creatures
but
because
he
is
the
seed
and
root
of
a
heavenly
life
within
us
the
principal
topic
therefore
dwelt
on
by
the
prophets
in
celebrating
the
kingdom
of
christ
is
that
there
would
then
be
a
more
exuberant
effusion
of
the
spirit
the
most
remarkable
passage
is
that
of
joel
i
will
pour
out
my
spirit
upon
all
flesh
in
those
for
though
the
prophet
seems
to
restrict
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
to
the
exercise
of
the
prophetic
function
yet
he
signifies
in
a
figurative
way
that
god
by
the
illumination
of
his
spirit
will
make
those
his
disciples
who
before
were
total
strangers
to
the
heavenly
doctrine
besides
as
god
the
father
gives
us
his
holy
spirit
for
the
sake
of
his
son
and
yet
has
deposited
all
fulness
with
his
son
that
he
might
be
the
minister
and
dispenser
of
his
own
goodness
holy
spirit
is
sometimes
called
the
spirit
of
the
father
and
sometimes
the
spirit
of
the
son
ye
says
paul
are
not
in
the
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
if
so
be
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwell
in
you
now
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
and
thence
he
inspires
a
hope
of
complete
renovation
for
he
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
for
there
is
no
absurdity
in
ascribing
to
the
father
the
praise
of
his
own
gifts
of
which
he
is
the
author
and
also
ascribing
the
same
glory
to
christ
with
whom
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
are
deposited
to
be
given
to
his
people
therefore
he
invites
all
who
thirst
to
come
to
him
and
drink
and
paul
teaches
us
that
unto
every
one
of
us
is
given
grace
according
to
the
measure
of
the
gift
of
and
it
must
be
remarked
that
he
is
called
the
spirit
of
christ
not
only
because
the
eternal
word
of
god
is
united
with
the
same
spirit
as
the
father
but
also
with
respect
to
his
character
of
mediator
for
if
he
had
not
been
endued
with
this
power
his
advent
to
us
would
have
been
altogether
in
vain
in
which
sense
he
is
called
the
second
adam
the
lord
from
heaven
a
quickening
spirit
where
paul
compares
the
peculiar
life
with
which
the
son
of
god
inspires
his
people
that
they
may
be
one
with
him
to
that
animal
life
which
is
equally
common
to
the
reprobate
so
where
he
wishes
to
the
faithful
the
grace
of
christ
and
the
love
of
god
he
adds
also
the
communion
of
the
spirit
without
which
there
can
be
no
enjoyment
of
the
paternal
favour
of
god
or
the
beneficence
of
christ
as
he
says
also
in
another
place
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
which
is
given
unto
iii
and
here
it
will
be
proper
to
notice
the
titles
by
which
the
scripture
distinguishes
the
spirit
where
it
treats
of
the
commencement
progress
and
completion
of
our
salvation
first
he
is
called
the
spirit
of
adoption
because
he
witnesses
to
us
the
gratuitous
benevolence
of
god
with
which
god
the
father
has
embraced
us
in
his
beloved
and
only
begotten
son
that
he
might
be
a
father
to
us
and
animates
us
to
pray
with
confidence
and
even
dictates
expressions
so
that
we
may
boldly
cry
abba
for
the
same
reason
he
is
said
to
be
the
earnest
and
seal
of
our
inheritance
because
while
we
are
pilgrims
and
strangers
in
the
world
and
as
persons
dead
he
infuses
into
us
such
life
from
heaven
that
we
are
certain
of
our
salvation
being
secured
by
the
divine
faithfulness
and
care
whence
he
is
also
said
to
be
life
because
of
righteousness
since
by
his
secret
showers
he
makes
us
fertile
in
producing
the
fruits
of
righteousness
he
is
frequently
called
water
as
in
isaiah
ho
every
one
that
thirsteth
come
ye
to
the
again
i
will
pour
water
upon
him
that
is
thirsty
and
floods
upon
the
dry
to
which
corresponds
the
invitation
of
christ
just
quoted
if
any
man
thirst
let
him
come
unto
he
sometimes
however
receives
this
appellation
from
his
purifying
and
cleansing
energy
as
in
ezekiel
where
the
lord
promises
to
sprinkle
clean
water
on
his
people
to
cleanse
them
from
their
impurities
because
he
restores
to
life
and
vigour
and
continually
supports
those
whom
he
has
anointed
with
the
oil
of
his
grape
he
thence
obtains
the
name
of
because
he
daily
consumes
the
vices
of
our
concupiscence
and
inflames
our
hearts
with
the
love
of
god
and
the
pursuit
of
piety
these
effects
he
is
justly
called
lastly
he
is
described
to
us
as
a
fountain
whence
we
receive
all
the
emanation
of
heavenly
riches
and
as
the
hand
of
god
by
which
he
exerts
his
power
because
by
the
breath
of
his
power
he
inspires
us
with
divine
life
so
that
we
are
not
now
actuated
from
ourselves
but
directed
by
his
agency
and
influence
so
that
if
there
be
any
good
in
us
it
is
the
fruit
of
his
grace
whereas
our
characters
without
him
are
darkness
of
mind
and
perverseness
of
heart
it
has
indeed
already
been
clearly
stated
that
till
our
minds
are
fixed
on
the
spirit
christ
remains
of
no
value
to
us
because
we
look
at
him
as
an
object
of
cold
speculation
without
us
and
therefore
at
a
great
distance
from
us
but
we
know
that
he
benefits
none
but
those
who
have
him
for
their
head
and
elder
brother
and
who
have
put
him
this
union
alone
renders
his
advent
in
the
character
of
a
saviour
available
to
us
we
learn
the
same
truth
from
that
sacred
marriage
by
which
we
are
made
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
bone
of
his
bone
and
therefore
one
with
him
it
is
only
by
his
spirit
that
he
unites
himself
with
us
and
by
the
grace
and
power
of
the
same
spirit
we
are
made
his
members
that
he
may
keep
us
under
himself
and
we
may
mutually
enjoy
him
iv
but
faith
being
his
principal
work
is
the
object
principally
referred
to
in
the
most
frequent
expressions
of
his
power
and
operation
because
it
is
the
only
medium
by
which
he
leads
us
into
the
light
of
the
gospel
according
to
the
declaration
of
john
that
christ
gave
power
or
privilege
to
become
the
sons
of
god
to
them
that
believed
on
his
name
which
were
born
not
of
blood
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
nor
of
the
will
of
man
but
of
god
where
opposing
god
to
flesh
and
blood
he
asserts
the
reception
of
christ
by
faith
by
those
who
would
otherwise
remain
unbelievers
to
be
a
supernatural
gift
similar
to
which
is
this
answer
of
christ
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
unto
thee
but
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
which
i
now
merely
mention
because
i
have
elsewhere
treated
it
at
large
similar
also
is
the
assertion
of
paul
that
the
ephesians
were
sealed
with
that
holy
spirit
of
for
this
shows
that
there
is
an
eternal
teacher
by
whose
agency
the
promise
of
salvation
which
otherwise
would
only
strike
the
air
or
at
most
our
ears
penetrates
into
our
minds
similar
also
is
his
remark
that
the
thessalonians
were
chosen
by
god
through
sanctification
of
the
spirit
and
belief
of
the
truth
by
which
connection
he
briefly
suggests
that
faith
itself
proceeds
only
from
the
spirit
john
expresses
this
in
plainer
terms
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
by
the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
again
hereby
know
we
that
we
dwell
in
him
and
he
in
us
because
he
hath
given
us
of
his
therefore
christ
promised
to
send
to
his
disciples
the
spirit
of
truth
whom
the
world
can
not
receive
that
they
might
be
capable
of
attaining
heavenly
wisdom
he
ascribes
to
him
the
peculiar
office
of
suggesting
to
their
minds
all
the
oral
instructions
which
he
had
given
them
for
in
vain
would
the
light
present
itself
to
the
blind
unless
this
spirit
of
understanding
would
open
their
mental
eyes
so
that
he
may
be
justly
called
the
key
with
which
the
treasures
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
are
unlocked
to
us
and
his
illumination
constitutes
our
mental
eyes
to
behold
them
it
is
therefore
that
paul
so
highly
commends
the
ministry
of
the
spirit
because
the
instructions
of
preachers
would
produce
no
benefit
did
not
christ
himself
the
internal
teacher
by
his
spirit
draw
to
him
those
who
were
given
him
by
the
father
therefore
as
we
have
stated
that
complete
salvation
is
found
in
the
person
of
christ
so
to
make
us
partakers
of
it
he
baptizes
us
with
the
holy
spirit
and
with
fire
enlightening
us
into
the
faith
of
his
gospel
regenerating
us
so
that
we
become
new
creatures
and
purging
us
from
profane
impurities
consecrates
us
as
holy
temples
to
god
chapter
ii
faith
defined
and
its
properties
described
all
these
things
will
be
easily
understood
when
we
have
given
a
clearer
definition
of
faith
that
the
reader
may
perceive
its
nature
and
importance
but
it
will
be
proper
to
recall
to
his
remembrance
what
has
been
already
stated
that
god
has
given
us
his
law
as
the
rule
of
our
conduct
and
that
if
we
are
guilty
of
even
the
smallest
breach
of
it
we
are
exposed
to
the
dreadful
punishment
of
eternal
death
which
he
denounces
again
that
since
it
is
not
only
difficult
but
entirely
above
our
strength
and
beyond
the
utmost
extent
of
our
ability
to
fulfil
the
law
as
he
requires
we
only
view
ourselves
and
consider
what
we
have
demerited
we
have
not
the
least
hope
left
but
as
persons
rejected
by
god
are
on
the
verge
of
eternal
perdition
in
the
third
place
it
has
been
explained
that
there
is
but
one
method
of
deliverance
by
which
we
can
be
extricated
from
such
a
direful
calamity
that
is
the
appearance
of
christ
the
redeemer
by
whose
means
our
heavenly
father
commiserating
us
in
his
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
has
been
pleased
to
relieve
us
if
we
embrace
this
mercy
with
a
sincere
faith
and
rely
on
it
with
a
constant
hope
but
we
must
now
examine
the
nature
of
this
faith
by
which
all
who
are
the
adopted
sons
of
god
enter
on
the
possession
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
since
it
is
certain
that
not
every
opinion
nor
even
every
persuasion
is
equal
to
the
accomplishment
of
so
great
a
work
and
we
ought
to
be
the
more
cautious
and
diligent
in
our
meditations
and
inquiries
on
the
genuine
property
of
faith
in
proportion
to
the
pernicious
tendency
of
the
mistakes
of
multitudes
in
the
present
age
on
this
subject
for
a
great
part
of
the
world
when
they
hear
the
word
conceive
it
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
common
assent
to
the
evangelical
history
and
even
the
disputes
of
the
schools
concerning
faith
by
simply
styling
god
the
object
of
it
as
i
have
elsewhere
observed
rather
mislead
miserable
souls
by
a
vain
speculation
than
direct
them
to
the
proper
mark
for
since
god
dwelleth
in
the
light
which
no
man
can
approach
unto
there
is
a
necessity
for
the
interposition
of
christ
as
the
medium
of
access
to
him
whence
he
calls
himself
the
light
of
the
world
and
in
another
place
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
because
no
man
cometh
unto
the
father
who
is
the
fountain
of
life
but
by
him
because
he
alone
knows
the
father
and
reveals
him
to
believers
for
this
reason
paul
asserts
that
he
esteemed
nothing
worthy
of
being
known
but
jesus
christ
and
in
the
twentieth
chapter
of
the
acts
declares
that
he
had
preached
faith
in
christ
and
in
another
place
he
introduces
christ
speaking
in
the
following
manner
i
send
thee
unto
the
gentiles
that
they
may
receive
forgiveness
of
sins
and
inheritance
among
them
which
are
sanctified
by
faith
that
is
in
this
apostle
tells
us
that
the
glory
of
god
is
visible
to
us
in
his
person
or
which
conveys
the
same
idea
that
the
light
of
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
shines
in
his
it
is
true
that
faith
relates
to
the
one
god
but
there
must
also
be
added
a
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
whom
he
has
sent
for
god
himself
would
be
altogether
concealed
from
us
if
we
were
not
illuminated
by
the
brightness
of
christ
for
this
purpose
the
father
has
deposited
all
his
treasures
with
his
only
begotten
son
that
he
might
reveal
himself
in
him
and
that
by
such
a
communication
of
blessings
he
might
express
a
true
image
of
his
glory
for
as
it
has
been
observed
that
we
require
to
be
drawn
by
the
spirit
that
we
may
be
excited
to
seek
christ
so
we
should
also
be
apprized
that
the
invisible
father
is
to
be
sought
only
in
this
image
on
which
subject
augustine
treating
of
the
object
of
faith
beautifully
remarks
that
we
ought
to
know
whither
we
should
go
and
in
what
way
and
immediately
after
he
concludes
that
he
who
unites
deity
and
humanity
in
one
person
is
the
way
most
secure
from
all
errors
for
that
it
is
god
towards
whom
we
tend
and
man
by
whom
we
go
but
that
both
together
can
be
found
only
in
nor
does
paul
when
he
speaks
of
faith
in
god
intend
to
subvert
what
he
so
frequently
inculcates
concerning
faith
whose
stability
is
wholly
in
christ
and
peter
most
suitably
connects
them
together
when
he
says
that
by
him
we
believe
in
ii
this
evil
then
as
well
as
innumerable
others
must
be
imputed
to
the
schoolmen
who
have
as
it
were
concealed
christ
by
drawing
a
veil
over
him
whereas
unless
our
views
be
immediately
and
steadily
directed
to
him
we
shall
always
be
wandering
through
labyrinths
without
end
they
not
only
by
their
obscure
definition
diminish
and
almost
annihilate
all
the
importance
of
faith
but
have
fabricated
the
notion
of
implicit
faith
a
term
with
which
they
have
honoured
the
grossest
ignorance
and
most
perniciously
deluded
the
miserable
multitude
indeed
to
express
the
fact
more
truly
and
plainly
this
notion
has
not
only
buried
the
true
faith
in
oblivion
but
has
entirely
destroyed
it
is
this
understand
nothing
but
obediently
to
submit
our
understanding
to
the
church
faith
consists
not
in
ignorance
but
in
knowledge
and
that
not
only
of
god
but
also
of
the
divine
will
for
we
do
not
obtain
salvation
by
our
promptitude
to
embrace
as
truth
whatever
the
church
may
have
prescribed
or
by
our
transferring
to
her
the
province
of
inquiry
and
of
knowledge
but
when
we
know
god
to
be
a
propitious
father
to
us
through
the
reconciliation
effected
by
christ
and
that
christ
is
given
to
us
for
righteousness
sanctification
and
life
this
knowledge
i
say
not
by
renouncing
our
understanding
we
obtain
an
entrance
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
when
the
apostle
says
that
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
righteousness
and
with
the
mouth
confession
is
made
unto
salvation
he
indicates
that
it
is
not
sufficient
for
a
man
implicitly
to
credit
what
he
neither
understands
nor
even
examines
but
he
requires
an
explicit
knowledge
of
the
divine
goodness
in
which
our
righteousness
consists
iii
i
do
not
deny
such
is
the
ignorance
with
which
we
are
enveloped
that
many
things
are
very
obscure
to
us
at
present
and
will
continue
to
be
so
till
we
shall
have
cast
off
the
burden
of
the
flesh
and
arrived
nearer
to
the
presence
of
god
on
such
subjects
nothing
would
be
more
proper
than
a
suspension
of
judgment
and
a
firm
resolution
to
maintain
unity
with
the
church
but
that
ignorance
combined
with
humility
should
under
this
pretext
be
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
faith
is
extremely
absurd
for
faith
consists
in
a
knowledge
of
god
and
of
christ
not
in
reverence
for
the
church
and
we
see
what
a
labyrinth
they
have
fabricated
by
this
notion
of
theirs
so
that
the
ignorant
and
inexperienced
without
any
discrimination
eagerly
embrace
as
oracular
every
thing
obtruded
upon
them
under
the
name
of
the
church
sometimes
even
the
most
monstrous
errors
this
inconsiderate
credulity
though
it
be
the
certain
precipice
of
ruin
is
nevertheless
excused
by
them
on
the
plea
that
it
credits
nothing
definitively
but
with
this
condition
annexed
if
such
be
the
faith
of
the
church
thus
they
pretend
that
truth
is
held
in
error
light
in
darkness
and
true
knowledge
in
ignorance
but
not
to
occupy
any
more
time
in
refuting
them
we
only
admonish
the
reader
to
compare
their
doctrine
with
ours
for
the
perspicuity
of
the
truth
will
of
itself
furnish
a
sufficient
refutation
for
the
question
with
them
is
not
whether
faith
be
yet
involved
in
many
relics
of
ignorance
but
they
positively
assert
that
persons
are
possessed
of
true
faith
who
are
charmed
with
their
ignorance
and
even
indulge
it
provided
they
assent
to
the
authority
and
judgment
of
the
church
concerning
things
unknown
as
if
the
scripture
did
not
universally
inculcate
that
knowledge
is
united
with
faith
iv
we
grant
that
during
our
pilgrimage
in
the
world
our
faith
is
implicit
not
only
because
many
things
are
yet
hidden
from
our
view
but
because
our
knowledge
of
every
thing
is
very
imperfect
in
consequence
of
the
clouds
of
error
by
which
we
are
surrounded
for
the
greatest
wisdom
of
those
who
are
most
perfect
is
to
improve
and
to
press
forward
with
patient
docility
therefore
paul
exhorts
the
faithful
if
they
differ
from
each
other
on
any
subject
to
wait
for
further
revelation
and
experience
teaches
us
that
till
we
are
divested
of
the
flesh
our
knowledge
falls
far
short
of
what
might
be
wished
in
reading
also
many
obscure
passages
daily
occur
which
convince
us
of
our
ignorance
with
this
barrier
god
restrains
us
within
the
bounds
of
modesty
assigning
to
every
one
a
measure
of
faith
that
even
the
most
learned
teacher
may
be
ready
to
learn
we
may
observe
eminent
examples
of
this
implicit
faith
in
the
disciples
of
christ
before
they
were
fully
enlightened
we
see
with
what
difficulty
they
imbibed
the
first
rudiments
how
they
hesitated
even
at
the
most
minute
particulars
what
inconsiderable
advances
they
made
even
while
hanging
on
the
lips
of
their
master
and
when
they
ran
to
the
grave
at
the
intelligence
of
the
women
his
resurrection
was
like
a
dream
to
them
the
testimony
already
borne
by
christ
to
their
possession
of
faith
forbids
us
to
say
that
they
were
entirely
destitute
of
it
indeed
if
they
had
not
been
persuaded
that
christ
would
rise
from
the
dead
they
would
have
felt
no
further
concern
about
him
the
women
were
not
induced
by
superstition
to
embalm
with
spices
the
body
of
a
deceased
man
of
whose
life
there
was
no
hope
but
though
they
credited
his
declarations
whose
veracity
they
well
knew
yet
the
ignorance
which
still
occupied
their
minds
involved
their
faith
in
darkness
so
that
they
were
almost
lost
in
astonishment
whence
also
they
are
said
at
length
to
have
believed
when
they
saw
the
words
of
christ
verified
by
facts
not
that
their
faith
then
commenced
but
the
seed
of
faith
which
had
been
latent
and
as
it
were
dead
in
their
hearts
then
shot
forth
with
additional
vigour
they
had
therefore
a
true
but
an
implicit
faith
because
they
received
christ
with
reverence
as
their
only
teacher
being
taught
by
him
they
were
persuaded
that
he
was
the
author
of
their
salvation
and
they
believed
that
he
came
from
heaven
that
through
the
grace
of
the
father
he
might
assemble
all
his
disciples
there
but
we
need
not
seek
a
more
familiar
proof
of
this
point
than
that
some
portion
of
unbelief
is
always
mixed
with
faith
in
every
christian
we
may
also
style
that
an
implicit
faith
which
in
strict
propriety
is
nothing
but
a
preparation
for
faith
the
evangelists
relate
that
many
believed
who
only
being
filled
with
admiration
at
the
miracles
of
christ
proceeded
no
further
than
a
persuasion
that
he
was
the
promised
messiah
although
they
had
little
or
no
knowledge
of
evangelical
doctrine
such
reverence
which
induced
them
cheerfully
to
submit
themselves
to
christ
is
dignified
with
the
title
of
faith
of
which
however
it
was
merely
the
commencement
thus
the
nobleman
or
courtier
who
believed
the
promise
of
christ
concerning
the
healing
of
his
son
when
he
returned
to
his
house
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
evangelist
believed
again
that
is
first
he
esteemed
as
an
oracle
what
he
had
heard
from
the
lips
of
christ
but
afterwards
he
devoted
himself
to
his
authority
to
receive
his
doctrine
it
must
be
understood
however
that
he
was
docile
and
ready
to
learn
that
the
word
in
the
first
place
denotes
a
particular
faith
but
in
the
second
place
it
numbers
him
among
the
disciples
who
had
given
their
names
to
christ
john
gives
us
a
similar
example
in
the
samaritans
who
believed
the
report
of
the
woman
so
as
to
run
with
eagerness
to
christ
but
who
after
having
heard
him
said
to
the
woman
now
we
believe
not
because
of
thy
saying
for
we
have
heard
him
ourselves
and
know
that
this
is
indeed
the
christ
the
saviour
of
the
hence
it
appears
that
persons
not
yet
initiated
into
the
first
elements
but
only
inclined
to
obedience
are
called
believers
not
indeed
with
strict
propriety
but
because
god
in
his
goodness
distinguishes
that
pious
disposition
with
such
a
great
honour
but
this
docility
connected
with
a
desire
of
improvement
is
very
remote
from
that
gross
ignorance
which
stupefies
those
who
are
content
with
such
an
implicit
faith
as
the
papists
have
invented
for
if
paul
severely
condemns
those
who
are
ever
learning
yet
never
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
how
much
greater
ignominy
do
they
deserve
who
make
it
their
study
to
know
nothing
vi
this
then
is
the
true
knowledge
of
receive
him
as
he
is
offered
by
the
father
that
is
invested
with
his
gospel
for
as
he
is
appointed
to
be
the
object
of
our
faith
so
we
can
not
advance
in
the
right
way
to
him
without
the
guidance
of
the
gospel
the
gospel
certainly
opens
to
us
those
treasures
of
grace
without
which
christ
would
profit
us
little
thus
paul
connects
faith
as
an
inseparable
concomitant
with
doctrine
where
he
says
ye
have
not
so
learned
christ
if
so
be
ye
have
been
taught
by
him
as
the
truth
is
in
yet
i
do
not
so
far
restrict
faith
to
the
gospel
but
that
i
admit
moses
and
the
prophets
to
have
delivered
what
was
sufficient
for
its
establishment
but
because
the
gospel
exhibits
a
fuller
manifestation
of
christ
it
is
justly
styled
by
paul
the
words
of
faith
and
of
good
for
the
same
reason
in
another
place
he
represents
the
law
as
abolished
by
the
coming
of
faith
comprehending
under
this
term
the
new
kind
of
teaching
by
which
christ
since
his
appearance
as
our
master
has
given
a
brighter
display
of
the
mercy
of
the
father
and
a
more
explicit
testimony
concerning
our
salvation
the
more
easy
and
convenient
method
for
us
will
be
to
descend
regularly
from
the
genus
to
the
species
in
the
first
place
we
must
be
apprized
that
faith
has
a
perpetual
relation
to
the
word
and
can
no
more
be
separated
from
it
than
the
rays
from
the
sun
whence
they
proceed
therefore
god
proclaims
by
isaiah
hear
and
your
souls
shall
and
that
the
word
is
the
fountain
of
faith
is
evident
from
this
language
of
john
these
are
written
that
ye
might
the
psalmist
also
intending
to
exhort
the
people
to
faith
says
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
and
to
hear
generally
means
to
believe
lastly
it
is
not
without
reason
that
in
isaiah
god
distinguishes
the
children
of
the
church
from
strangers
by
this
character
that
they
shall
all
be
his
disciples
and
be
taught
by
him
for
if
this
were
a
benefit
common
to
all
why
should
he
address
himself
to
a
few
correspondent
with
this
is
the
general
use
of
the
words
believers
and
disciples
as
synonymous
by
the
evangelists
on
all
occasions
and
by
luke
in
particular
very
frequently
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
which
he
extends
the
latter
epithet
even
to
a
woman
wherefore
if
faith
decline
in
the
smallest
degree
from
this
object
towards
which
it
ought
to
be
directed
it
no
longer
retains
its
own
nature
but
becomes
an
uncertain
credulity
and
an
erroneous
excursion
of
the
mind
the
same
divine
word
is
the
foundation
by
which
faith
is
sustained
and
supported
from
which
it
can
not
be
moved
without
an
immediate
downfall
take
away
the
word
then
and
there
will
be
no
faith
left
we
are
not
here
disputing
whether
the
ministry
of
men
be
necessary
to
disseminate
the
word
of
god
by
which
faith
is
produced
which
we
shall
discuss
in
another
place
but
we
assert
that
the
word
itself
however
it
may
be
conveyed
to
us
is
like
a
mirror
in
which
faith
may
behold
god
whether
therefore
god
in
this
instance
use
the
agency
of
men
or
whether
he
operate
solely
by
his
own
power
he
always
discovers
himself
by
his
word
to
those
whom
he
designs
to
draw
to
himself
whence
paul
defines
faith
as
an
obedience
rendered
to
the
gospel
and
praises
the
service
of
faith
for
the
apprehension
of
faith
is
not
confined
to
our
knowing
that
there
is
a
god
but
chiefly
consists
in
our
understanding
what
is
his
disposition
towards
us
for
it
is
not
of
so
much
importance
to
us
to
know
what
he
is
in
himself
as
what
he
is
willing
to
be
to
us
we
find
therefore
that
faith
is
a
knowledge
of
the
will
of
god
respecting
us
received
from
his
word
and
the
foundation
of
this
is
a
previous
persuasion
of
the
divine
veracity
any
doubt
of
which
being
entertained
in
the
mind
the
authority
of
the
word
will
be
dubious
and
weak
or
rather
it
will
be
of
no
authority
at
all
nor
is
it
sufficient
to
believe
that
the
veracity
of
god
is
incapable
of
deception
or
falsehood
unless
you
also
admit
as
beyond
all
doubt
that
whatever
proceeds
from
him
is
sacred
and
inviolable
truth
vii
but
as
the
human
heart
is
not
excited
to
faith
by
every
word
of
god
we
must
further
inquire
what
part
of
the
word
it
is
with
which
faith
is
particularly
concerned
god
declared
to
adam
thou
shalt
surely
die
and
to
cain
the
voice
of
thy
brother
s
blood
crieth
unto
me
from
the
ground
but
these
declarations
are
so
far
from
being
adapted
to
the
establishment
of
faith
that
of
themselves
they
can
only
shake
it
we
do
not
deny
that
it
is
the
office
of
faith
to
subscribe
to
the
truth
of
god
whatever
be
the
time
the
nature
or
the
manner
of
his
communications
but
our
present
inquiry
is
only
what
faith
finds
in
the
divine
word
upon
which
to
rest
its
dependence
and
confidence
when
our
conscience
beholds
nothing
but
indignation
and
vengeance
how
shall
it
not
tremble
with
fear
and
if
god
be
the
object
of
its
terror
how
should
it
not
fly
from
him
but
faith
ought
to
seek
god
not
to
fly
from
him
it
appears
then
that
we
have
not
yet
a
complete
definition
of
faith
since
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
indefinitely
ought
not
to
be
accounted
faith
but
suppose
instead
of
will
declaration
of
which
is
often
productive
of
fear
and
sorrow
substitute
benevolence
or
mercy
this
will
certainly
bring
us
nearer
to
the
nature
of
faith
for
we
are
allured
to
seek
god
after
we
have
learned
that
salvation
is
laid
up
for
us
with
him
which
is
confirmed
to
us
by
his
declaring
it
to
be
the
object
of
his
care
and
affection
therefore
we
need
a
promise
of
grace
to
assure
us
that
he
is
our
propitious
father
since
we
can
not
approach
to
him
without
it
and
it
is
upon
that
alone
that
the
human
heart
can
securely
depend
for
this
reason
in
the
psalms
mercy
and
truth
are
generally
united
as
being
closely
connected
because
it
would
be
of
no
avail
for
us
to
know
the
veracity
of
god
if
he
did
not
allure
us
to
himself
by
his
mercy
nor
should
we
embrace
his
mercy
if
he
did
not
offer
it
with
his
own
mouth
i
have
declared
thy
faithfulness
and
thy
salvation
i
have
not
concealed
thy
and
thy
truth
let
thy
and
thy
truth
continually
preserve
again
thy
mercy
o
lord
is
in
the
heavens
and
thy
faithfulness
reacheth
unto
the
again
all
the
paths
of
the
lord
are
mercy
and
truth
unto
such
as
keep
his
again
his
merciful
kindness
is
great
towards
us
and
the
truth
of
the
lord
endureth
for
again
i
will
praise
thy
name
for
thy
and
for
thy
i
forbear
to
quote
what
we
read
in
the
prophets
to
the
same
purport
that
god
is
merciful
and
faithful
in
his
promises
for
it
will
be
temerity
to
conclude
that
god
is
propitious
to
us
unless
he
testify
concerning
himself
and
anticipate
us
by
his
invitation
that
his
will
respecting
us
may
be
neither
ambiguous
nor
obscure
but
we
have
already
seen
that
christ
is
the
only
pledge
of
his
love
without
whom
the
tokens
of
his
hatred
and
wrath
are
manifest
both
above
and
below
now
since
the
knowledge
of
the
divine
goodness
will
not
be
attended
with
much
advantage
unless
it
lead
us
to
rely
upon
it
we
must
exclude
that
apprehension
of
it
which
is
mixed
with
doubts
which
is
not
uniform
and
steady
but
wavering
and
undecided
now
the
human
mind
blinded
and
darkened
as
it
is
is
very
far
from
being
able
to
penetrate
and
attain
to
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
and
the
heart
also
fluctuating
in
perpetual
hesitation
is
far
from
continuing
unshaken
in
that
persuasion
therefore
our
mind
must
be
illuminated
and
our
heart
established
by
some
exterior
power
that
the
word
of
god
may
obtain
full
credit
with
us
now
we
shall
have
a
complete
definition
of
faith
if
we
say
that
it
is
a
steady
and
certain
knowledge
of
the
divine
benevolence
towards
us
which
being
founded
on
the
truth
of
the
gratuitous
promise
in
christ
is
both
revealed
to
our
minds
and
confirmed
to
our
hearts
by
the
holy
spirit
viii
but
before
i
proceed
any
further
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
some
preliminary
observations
for
the
solution
of
difficulties
which
otherwise
might
prove
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
reader
and
first
we
must
refute
the
nugatory
distinction
which
prevails
in
the
schools
of
formal
and
informal
faith
for
they
imagine
that
such
as
are
not
impressed
with
any
fear
of
god
or
with
any
sense
of
piety
believe
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
known
in
order
to
salvation
as
though
the
holy
spirit
in
illuminating
our
hearts
to
faith
were
not
a
witness
to
us
of
our
adoption
yet
in
opposition
to
the
whole
tenor
of
scripture
they
presumptuously
dignify
such
a
persuasion
destitute
of
the
fear
of
god
with
the
name
of
faith
we
need
not
contend
with
this
definition
any
further
than
by
simply
describing
the
nature
of
faith
as
it
is
represented
in
the
divine
word
and
this
will
clearly
evince
the
ignorance
and
insipidity
of
their
clamour
concerning
it
i
have
treated
it
in
part
already
and
shall
subjoin
what
remains
in
its
proper
place
at
present
i
affirm
that
a
greater
absurdity
than
this
figment
of
theirs
can
not
possibly
be
imagined
they
maintain
faith
to
be
a
mere
assent
with
which
every
despiser
of
god
may
receive
as
true
whatever
is
contained
in
the
scripture
but
first
it
should
be
examined
whether
every
man
acquires
faith
for
himself
by
his
own
power
or
whether
it
is
by
faith
that
the
holy
spirit
becomes
the
witness
of
adoption
they
betray
puerile
folly
therefore
in
inquiring
whether
faith
which
is
formed
by
the
superaddition
of
a
quality
be
the
same
or
whether
it
be
a
new
and
different
faith
it
clearly
appears
that
while
they
have
been
trifling
in
this
manner
they
never
thought
of
the
peculiar
gift
of
the
spirit
for
the
commencement
of
faith
contains
in
it
the
reconciliation
by
which
man
draws
near
to
god
but
if
they
would
duly
consider
that
declaration
of
paul
with
the
heart
man
believeth
unto
righteousness
they
would
cease
their
trifling
about
this
superadded
quality
if
we
had
only
this
one
reason
it
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
terminate
the
the
assent
which
we
give
to
the
divine
word
as
i
have
partly
suggested
before
and
shall
again
more
largely
repeat
is
from
the
heart
rather
than
the
head
and
from
the
affections
rather
than
the
understanding
for
which
reason
it
is
called
the
obedience
of
faith
to
which
the
lord
prefers
no
other
obedience
because
nothing
is
more
precious
to
him
than
his
own
truth
which
according
to
the
testimony
of
john
the
baptist
believers
as
it
were
subscribe
and
seal
as
this
is
by
no
means
a
dubious
point
we
conclude
at
once
that
it
is
an
absurdity
to
say
that
faith
is
formed
by
the
addition
of
a
pious
affection
to
an
assent
of
the
mind
whereas
even
this
assent
consists
in
a
pious
affection
and
is
so
described
in
the
scriptures
but
another
argument
offers
itself
which
is
still
plainer
since
faith
accepts
christ
as
he
is
offered
to
us
by
the
father
and
he
is
offered
not
only
for
righteousness
remission
of
sins
and
peace
but
also
for
sanctification
and
as
a
fountain
of
living
water
it
is
certain
that
no
man
can
ever
know
him
aright
unless
he
at
the
same
time
receive
the
sanctification
of
the
spirit
or
if
any
one
would
wish
it
to
be
more
clearly
expressed
faith
consists
in
a
knowledge
of
christ
christ
can
not
be
known
without
the
sanctification
of
his
spirit
consequently
faith
is
absolutely
inseparable
from
a
pious
affection
ix
this
passage
of
paul
though
i
have
all
faith
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
charity
i
am
nothing
is
generally
adduced
by
them
to
support
the
notion
of
an
informal
faith
unaccompanied
with
charity
but
they
overlook
the
sense
in
which
the
apostle
uses
the
word
faith
in
this
place
for
having
in
the
preceding
chapter
treated
of
the
various
gifts
of
the
spirit
among
which
he
has
enumerated
divers
kinds
of
tongues
the
working
of
miracles
and
prophecy
and
having
exhorted
the
corinthians
to
covet
earnestly
the
best
gifts
from
which
the
greatest
benefit
and
advantage
would
accrue
to
the
whole
body
of
the
church
he
adds
yet
show
i
unto
you
a
more
excellent
way
implying
that
all
such
gifts
whatever
be
their
intrinsic
excellence
are
yet
to
be
deemed
worthless
unless
they
be
subservient
to
charity
for
that
being
given
for
the
edification
of
the
church
if
not
employed
for
that
purpose
they
lose
their
beauty
and
value
to
prove
this
he
particularly
specifies
them
repeating
the
same
gifts
which
he
had
before
enumerated
but
under
other
names
he
uses
the
word
faith
to
denote
what
he
had
before
called
powers
δυναμεις
that
is
a
power
of
working
miracles
this
then
whether
it
be
called
power
or
faith
being
a
particular
gift
of
god
which
any
impious
man
may
both
possess
and
abuse
as
the
gift
of
tongues
or
prophecy
or
other
gifts
we
need
not
wonder
if
it
be
separated
from
charity
but
the
mistake
of
such
persons
arises
wholly
from
though
the
word
faith
is
used
in
many
senses
not
observing
this
diversity
of
signification
they
argue
as
if
it
had
always
the
same
meaning
the
passage
which
they
adduce
from
james
in
support
of
the
same
error
shall
be
discussed
in
another
place
now
although
for
the
sake
of
instruction
when
we
design
to
show
the
nature
of
that
knowledge
of
god
which
is
possessed
by
the
impious
we
allow
that
there
are
various
kinds
of
faith
yet
we
acknowledge
and
preach
only
one
faith
in
the
pious
according
to
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
many
men
certainly
believe
that
there
is
a
god
they
admit
the
evangelical
history
and
the
other
parts
of
scripture
to
be
true
just
as
we
form
an
opinion
of
transactions
which
are
narrated
as
having
occurred
in
former
times
or
of
which
we
have
ourselves
been
spectators
there
are
some
who
go
further
esteeming
the
word
of
god
as
an
undoubted
revelation
from
heaven
not
wholly
disregarding
its
precepts
and
being
in
some
measure
affected
both
by
its
denunciations
and
by
its
promises
to
such
persons
indeed
faith
is
attributed
but
by
a
catachresis
a
tropical
or
improper
form
of
expression
because
they
do
not
with
open
impiety
resist
or
reject
or
contemn
the
word
of
god
but
rather
exhibit
some
appearance
of
obedience
to
it
x
but
this
shadow
or
image
of
faith
as
it
is
of
no
importance
so
is
unworthy
of
the
name
of
faith
its
great
distance
from
the
substantial
truth
of
which
though
we
shall
show
more
at
large
hereafter
there
can
be
no
objection
to
its
being
briefly
pointed
out
here
simon
magus
is
said
to
have
believed
who
nevertheless
just
after
betrays
his
unbelief
when
faith
is
attributed
to
him
we
do
not
apprehend
with
some
that
he
merely
pretended
to
it
with
his
lips
while
he
had
none
in
his
heart
but
we
rather
think
that
being
overcome
with
the
majesty
of
the
gospel
he
did
exercise
a
kind
of
faith
and
perceived
christ
to
be
the
author
of
life
and
salvation
so
as
freely
to
profess
himself
one
of
his
followers
thus
in
the
gospel
of
luke
those
persons
are
said
to
believe
for
a
time
in
whom
the
seed
of
the
word
is
prematurely
choked
before
it
fructifies
and
those
in
whom
it
takes
no
root
but
soon
dries
up
and
perishes
we
doubt
not
but
such
persons
being
attracted
with
some
taste
of
the
word
receive
it
with
avidity
and
begin
to
perceive
something
of
its
divine
power
so
that
by
the
fallacious
counterfeit
of
faith
they
impose
not
only
on
the
eyes
of
men
but
even
on
their
own
minds
for
they
persuade
themselves
that
the
reverence
which
they
show
for
the
word
of
god
is
real
piety
supposing
that
there
is
no
impiety
but
a
manifest
and
acknowledged
abuse
or
contempt
of
it
but
whatever
be
the
nature
of
that
assent
it
penetrates
not
to
the
heart
so
as
to
fix
its
residence
there
and
though
it
sometimes
appears
to
have
shot
forth
roots
yet
there
is
no
life
in
them
the
heart
of
man
has
so
many
recesses
of
vanity
and
so
many
retreats
of
falsehood
and
is
so
enveloped
with
fraudulent
hypocrisy
that
it
frequently
deceives
even
himself
but
let
them
who
glory
in
such
phantoms
of
faith
know
that
in
this
respect
they
are
not
at
all
superior
to
devils
persons
of
the
former
description
who
hear
and
understand
without
any
emotion
those
things
the
knowledge
of
which
makes
devils
tremble
are
certainly
far
inferior
to
the
fallen
spirits
and
the
others
are
equal
to
them
in
this
the
sentiments
with
which
they
are
impressed
finally
terminate
in
terror
and
consternation
xi
i
know
that
it
appears
harsh
to
some
when
faith
is
attributed
to
the
reprobate
since
paul
affirms
it
to
be
the
fruit
of
election
but
this
difficulty
is
easily
solved
for
though
none
are
illuminated
to
faith
or
truly
feel
the
efficacy
of
the
gospel
but
such
as
are
preordained
to
salvation
yet
experience
shows
that
the
reprobate
are
sometimes
affected
with
emotions
very
similar
to
those
of
the
elect
so
that
in
their
own
opinion
they
in
no
respect
differ
from
the
elect
wherefore
it
is
not
at
all
absurd
that
a
taste
of
heavenly
gifts
is
ascribed
to
them
by
the
apostle
and
a
temporary
faith
by
christ
not
that
they
truly
perceive
the
energy
of
spiritual
grace
and
clear
light
of
faith
but
because
the
lord
to
render
their
guilt
more
manifest
and
inexcusable
insinuates
himself
into
their
minds
as
far
as
his
goodness
can
be
enjoyed
without
the
spirit
of
adoption
if
any
one
object
that
there
remains
then
no
further
evidence
by
which
the
faithful
can
certainly
judge
of
their
adoption
i
reply
that
although
there
is
a
great
similitude
and
affinity
between
the
elect
of
god
and
those
who
are
endued
with
a
frail
and
transitory
faith
yet
the
elect
possess
that
confidence
which
paul
celebrates
so
as
boldly
to
cry
abba
therefore
as
god
regenerates
for
ever
the
elect
alone
with
incorruptible
seed
so
that
the
seed
of
life
planted
in
their
hearts
never
perishes
so
he
firmly
seals
within
them
the
grace
of
his
adoption
that
it
may
be
confirmed
and
ratified
to
their
minds
but
this
by
no
means
prevents
that
inferior
operation
of
the
spirit
from
exerting
itself
even
in
the
reprobate
in
the
mean
time
the
faithful
are
taught
to
examine
themselves
with
solicitude
and
humility
lest
carnal
security
insinuate
itself
instead
of
the
assurance
of
faith
besides
the
reprobate
have
only
a
confused
perception
of
grace
so
that
they
embrace
the
shadow
rather
than
the
substance
because
the
spirit
properly
seals
remission
of
sins
in
the
elect
alone
and
they
apply
it
by
a
special
faith
to
their
own
benefit
yet
the
reprobate
are
justly
said
to
believe
that
god
is
propitious
to
them
because
they
receive
the
gift
of
reconciliation
though
in
a
confused
and
too
indistinct
manner
not
that
they
are
partakers
of
the
same
faith
or
regeneration
with
the
sons
of
god
but
because
they
appear
under
the
disguise
of
hypocrisy
to
have
the
principle
of
faith
in
common
with
them
nor
do
i
deny
that
god
so
far
enlightens
their
minds
that
they
discover
his
grace
but
he
so
distinguishes
that
perception
from
the
peculiar
testimony
which
he
gives
to
his
elect
that
they
never
attain
any
solid
effect
and
enjoyment
for
he
does
not
therefore
show
himself
propitious
to
them
by
truly
delivering
them
from
death
and
receiving
them
under
his
protection
but
he
only
manifests
to
them
present
mercy
but
he
vouchsafes
to
the
elect
alone
the
living
root
of
faith
that
they
may
persevere
even
to
the
end
thus
we
have
refuted
the
objection
that
if
god
truly
discovers
his
grace
it
remains
for
ever
because
nothing
prevents
god
from
illuminating
some
with
a
present
perception
of
his
grace
which
afterwards
vanishes
away
xii
moreover
though
faith
is
a
knowledge
of
the
benevolence
of
god
towards
us
and
a
certain
persuasion
of
his
veracity
yet
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
subjects
of
these
temporary
impressions
lose
the
sense
of
divine
love
which
notwithstanding
its
affinity
to
faith
is
yet
widely
different
from
it
the
will
of
god
i
confess
is
immutable
and
his
truth
always
consistent
with
itself
but
i
deny
that
the
reprobate
ever
go
so
far
as
to
penetrate
to
that
secret
revelation
which
the
scripture
confines
to
the
elect
i
deny
therefore
that
they
either
apprehend
the
will
of
god
as
it
is
immutable
or
embrace
his
truth
with
constancy
because
they
rest
in
a
fugitive
sentiment
thus
a
tree
not
planted
deeply
enough
to
shoot
forth
living
roots
in
process
of
time
withers
though
for
some
years
it
may
produce
not
only
leaves
and
blossoms
but
even
fruits
finally
as
the
defection
of
the
first
man
was
sufficient
to
obliterate
the
divine
image
from
his
mind
and
soul
so
we
need
not
wonder
if
god
enlightens
the
reprobate
with
some
beams
of
his
grace
which
he
afterwards
suffers
to
be
extinguished
nor
does
any
thing
prevent
him
from
slightly
tincturing
some
with
the
knowledge
of
his
gospel
and
thoroughly
imbuing
others
with
it
it
must
nevertheless
be
remembered
that
how
diminutive
and
weak
soever
faith
may
be
in
the
elect
yet
as
the
spirit
of
god
is
a
certain
pledge
and
seal
to
them
of
their
adoption
his
impression
can
never
be
erased
from
their
hearts
but
that
the
reprobate
have
only
a
few
scattered
rays
of
light
which
are
afterwards
lost
yet
that
the
spirit
is
not
chargeable
with
deception
because
he
infuses
no
life
into
the
seed
which
he
drops
in
their
hearts
that
it
may
remain
for
ever
incorruptible
as
in
the
elect
i
go
still
further
for
since
it
is
evident
from
the
tenor
of
the
scripture
and
from
daily
experience
that
the
reprobate
are
sometimes
affected
with
a
sense
of
divine
grace
some
desire
of
mutual
love
must
necessarily
be
excited
in
their
hearts
thus
saul
had
for
a
time
a
pious
disposition
to
love
god
from
whom
experiencing
paternal
kindness
he
was
allured
by
the
charms
of
his
goodness
but
as
the
persuasion
of
the
paternal
love
of
god
is
not
radically
fixed
in
the
reprobate
so
they
love
him
not
reciprocally
with
the
sincere
affection
of
children
but
are
influenced
by
a
mercenary
disposition
for
the
spirit
of
love
was
given
to
christ
alone
that
he
might
instil
it
into
his
members
and
this
observation
of
paul
certainly
extends
to
none
but
the
elect
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
which
is
given
unto
us
the
same
love
which
generates
that
confidence
of
invocation
which
i
have
before
mentioned
thus
on
the
contrary
we
see
that
god
is
wonderfully
angry
with
his
children
whom
he
ceases
not
to
love
not
that
he
really
hates
them
but
because
he
designs
to
terrify
them
with
a
sense
of
his
wrath
to
humble
their
carnal
pride
to
shake
off
their
indolence
and
to
excite
them
to
repentance
therefore
they
apprehend
him
to
be
both
angry
with
them
or
at
least
with
their
sins
and
propitious
to
them
at
the
same
time
for
they
sincerely
deprecate
his
wrath
and
yet
resort
to
him
for
succour
with
tranquillity
and
confidence
hence
it
appears
that
faith
is
not
hypocritically
counterfeited
by
some
who
nevertheless
are
destitute
of
true
faith
but
while
they
are
hurried
away
with
a
sudden
impetuosity
of
zeal
they
deceive
themselves
by
a
false
opinion
nor
is
it
to
be
doubted
that
indolence
preoccupies
them
and
prevents
them
from
properly
examining
their
hearts
as
they
ought
to
do
it
is
probable
that
those
persons
were
of
this
description
to
whom
according
to
john
jesus
did
not
commit
himself
notwithstanding
that
they
believed
in
him
because
he
knew
all
men
he
knew
what
was
in
if
multitudes
did
not
depart
from
the
common
faith
i
style
it
common
because
there
is
a
great
similitude
and
affinity
between
temporary
faith
and
that
which
is
living
and
perpetual
christ
would
not
have
said
to
his
disciples
if
ye
continue
in
my
word
then
are
ye
my
disciples
indeed
and
ye
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
for
he
addresses
those
who
have
embraced
his
doctrine
and
exhorts
them
to
an
increase
of
faith
that
the
light
which
they
have
received
may
not
be
extinguished
by
their
own
supineness
therefore
paul
claims
faith
as
peculiar
to
the
elect
indicating
that
many
decay
because
they
have
had
no
living
root
thus
also
christ
says
in
matthew
every
plant
which
my
heavenly
father
hath
not
planted
shall
be
rooted
there
is
a
grosser
deception
in
others
who
are
not
ashamed
to
attempt
to
deceive
both
god
and
men
james
inveighs
against
this
class
of
men
who
impiously
profane
faith
by
hypocritical
pretensions
to
it
nor
would
paul
require
from
the
children
of
god
a
faith
unfeigned
but
because
multitudes
presumptuously
arrogate
to
themselves
what
they
possess
not
and
with
their
vain
pretences
deceive
others
and
sometimes
even
themselves
therefore
he
compares
a
good
conscience
to
a
vessel
in
which
faith
is
kept
because
many
having
put
away
a
good
conscience
concerning
faith
have
made
xiii
we
must
also
remember
the
ambiguous
signification
of
the
word
for
frequently
faith
signifies
the
sound
doctrine
of
piety
as
in
the
place
which
we
have
just
cited
and
in
the
same
epistle
where
paul
says
that
deacons
must
hold
the
mystery
of
the
faith
in
a
pure
also
where
he
predicts
the
apostasy
of
some
from
the
but
on
the
contrary
he
says
that
timothy
had
been
nourished
up
in
the
words
of
again
where
he
says
avoiding
profane
and
vain
babblings
and
oppositions
of
science
falsely
so
called
which
some
professing
have
erred
concerning
the
faith
whom
in
another
place
he
styles
reprobates
concerning
the
thus
also
when
he
directs
titus
to
rebuke
them
that
they
may
be
sound
in
the
faith
by
soundness
he
means
nothing
more
than
that
purity
of
doctrine
which
is
so
liable
to
be
corrupted
and
to
degenerate
through
the
instability
of
men
since
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
are
hidden
in
christ
whom
faith
possesses
faith
is
justly
extended
to
the
whole
summary
of
heavenly
doctrines
with
which
it
is
inseparably
connected
on
the
contrary
it
is
sometimes
restricted
to
a
particular
object
as
when
matthew
says
that
jesus
saw
their
faith
who
let
down
the
paralytic
man
through
the
roof
and
when
christ
exclaimed
respecting
the
centurion
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
but
it
is
probable
that
the
centurion
was
wholly
intent
on
the
recovery
of
his
son
a
concern
for
whom
wholly
occupied
his
mind
yet
because
he
was
contented
with
the
mere
answer
of
christ
without
being
importunate
for
his
corporeal
presence
it
is
on
account
of
this
circumstance
that
his
faith
is
so
greatly
extolled
and
we
have
lately
shown
that
paul
uses
faith
for
the
gift
of
miracles
which
is
possessed
by
those
who
are
neither
regenerated
by
the
spirit
of
god
nor
serious
worshippers
of
him
in
another
place
also
he
uses
it
to
denote
the
instruction
by
which
we
are
edified
in
the
faith
for
when
he
suggests
that
faith
will
be
abolished
it
must
undoubtedly
be
referred
to
the
ministry
of
the
church
which
is
at
present
useful
to
our
infirmity
in
these
forms
of
expression
however
there
is
an
evident
analogy
but
when
the
word
faith
is
in
an
improper
sense
transferred
to
a
hypocritical
profession
or
to
that
which
falsely
assumes
the
name
it
should
not
be
accounted
a
harsher
catachresis
than
when
the
fear
of
god
is
used
for
a
corrupt
and
perverse
worship
as
when
it
is
frequently
said
in
the
sacred
history
that
the
foreign
nations
which
had
been
transplanted
to
samaria
and
its
vicinity
feared
the
fictitious
deities
and
the
god
of
israel
which
is
like
confounding
together
heaven
and
earth
but
our
present
inquiry
is
what
is
that
faith
by
which
the
children
of
god
are
distinguished
from
unbelievers
by
which
we
invoke
god
as
our
father
by
which
we
pass
from
death
to
life
and
by
which
christ
our
eternal
life
and
salvation
dwells
in
us
the
force
and
nature
of
it
i
conceive
i
have
concisely
and
clearly
explained
xiv
now
let
us
again
examine
all
the
parts
of
that
definition
a
careful
consideration
of
which
i
think
will
leave
nothing
doubtful
remaining
when
we
call
it
knowledge
we
intend
not
such
a
comprehension
as
men
commonly
have
of
those
things
which
fall
under
the
notice
of
their
senses
for
it
is
so
superior
that
the
human
mind
must
exceed
and
rise
above
itself
in
order
to
attain
to
it
nor
does
the
mind
which
attains
it
comprehend
what
it
perceives
but
being
persuaded
of
that
which
it
can
not
comprehend
it
understands
more
by
the
certainty
of
this
persuasion
than
it
would
comprehend
of
any
human
object
by
the
exercise
of
its
natural
capacity
wherefore
paul
beautifully
expresses
it
in
these
terms
to
comprehend
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
for
he
meant
to
suggest
that
what
our
mind
apprehends
by
faith
is
absolutely
infinite
and
that
this
kind
of
knowledge
far
exceeds
all
understanding
yet
because
god
has
revealed
to
his
saints
the
secret
of
his
will
which
had
been
hidden
from
ages
and
from
generations
therefore
is
in
scripture
justly
styled
an
acknowledgment
and
by
john
knowledge
when
he
asserts
that
believers
know
that
they
are
the
sons
of
god
and
they
have
indeed
a
certain
knowledge
of
it
but
are
rather
confirmed
by
a
persuasion
of
the
veracity
of
god
than
taught
by
any
demonstration
of
reason
the
language
of
paul
also
indicates
this
whilst
we
are
at
home
in
the
body
we
are
absent
from
the
lord
for
we
walk
by
faith
not
by
by
this
he
shows
that
the
things
which
we
understand
through
faith
are
at
a
distance
from
us
and
beyond
our
sight
whence
we
conclude
that
the
knowledge
of
faith
consists
more
in
certainty
than
in
comprehension
xv
to
express
the
solid
constancy
of
the
persuasion
we
further
say
that
it
is
a
certain
and
steady
knowledge
for
as
faith
is
not
content
with
a
dubious
and
versatile
opinion
so
neither
with
an
obscure
and
perplexed
conception
but
requires
a
full
and
fixed
certainty
such
as
is
commonly
obtained
respecting
things
that
have
been
tried
and
proved
for
unbelief
is
so
deeply
rooted
in
our
hearts
and
such
is
our
propensity
to
it
that
though
all
men
confess
with
the
tongue
that
god
is
faithful
no
man
can
persuade
himself
of
the
truth
of
it
without
the
most
arduous
exertions
especially
when
the
time
of
trial
comes
the
general
indecision
discloses
the
fault
which
was
previously
concealed
nor
is
it
without
reason
that
the
holy
spirit
asserts
the
authority
of
the
divine
word
in
terms
of
such
high
commendation
but
with
a
design
to
remedy
the
disease
which
i
have
mentioned
that
the
promises
of
god
may
obtain
full
credit
with
us
the
words
of
the
lord
says
david
are
pure
words
as
silver
tried
in
a
furnace
of
earth
purified
seven
again
the
word
of
the
lord
is
tried
he
is
a
buckler
to
all
those
that
trust
in
and
solomon
confirms
the
same
nearly
in
the
same
words
every
word
of
god
is
but
as
the
hundred
and
nineteenth
psalm
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
this
subject
it
were
needless
to
recite
any
more
testimonies
whenever
god
thus
recommends
his
word
to
us
he
without
doubt
obliquely
reprehends
our
unbelief
for
the
design
of
those
recommendations
is
no
other
than
to
eradicate
perverse
doubts
from
our
hearts
there
are
also
many
who
have
such
conceptions
of
the
divine
mercy
as
to
receive
but
very
little
consolation
from
it
for
they
are
at
the
same
time
distressed
with
an
unhappy
anxiety
doubting
whether
he
will
be
merciful
to
them
because
they
confine
within
too
narrow
limits
that
clemency
of
which
they
suppose
themselves
to
be
fully
persuaded
for
they
reflect
with
themselves
thus
that
his
mercy
is
large
and
copious
bestowed
upon
many
and
ready
for
the
acceptance
of
all
but
that
it
is
uncertain
whether
it
will
reach
them
also
or
rather
whether
they
shall
reach
it
this
thought
since
it
stops
in
the
midst
of
its
course
is
incomplete
therefore
it
does
not
so
much
confirm
the
mind
with
secure
tranquillity
as
disturb
it
with
restless
hesitation
but
very
different
is
the
meaning
of
full
assurance
πληροφοριας
which
is
always
attributed
to
faith
in
the
scriptures
and
which
places
the
goodness
of
god
that
is
clearly
revealed
to
us
beyond
all
doubt
but
this
can
not
take
place
unless
we
have
a
real
sense
and
experience
of
its
sweetness
in
ourselves
wherefore
the
apostle
from
faith
deduces
confidence
and
from
confidence
boldness
for
this
is
his
language
in
christ
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
by
the
faith
of
these
words
imply
that
we
have
no
right
faith
but
when
we
can
venture
with
tranquillity
into
the
divine
presence
this
boldness
arises
only
from
a
certain
confidence
of
the
divine
benevolence
and
our
salvation
which
is
so
true
that
the
word
faith
is
frequently
used
for
confidence
xvi
the
principal
hinge
on
which
faith
turns
is
we
must
not
consider
the
promises
of
mercy
which
the
lord
offers
as
true
only
to
others
and
not
to
ourselves
but
rather
make
them
our
own
by
embracing
them
in
our
hearts
hence
arises
that
confidence
which
the
same
apostle
in
another
place
calls
peace
unless
any
one
would
rather
make
peace
the
effect
of
confidence
it
is
a
security
which
makes
the
conscience
calm
and
serene
before
the
divine
tribunal
and
without
which
it
must
necessarily
be
harassed
and
torn
almost
asunder
with
tumultuous
trepidation
unless
it
happen
to
slumber
for
a
moment
in
an
oblivion
of
god
and
itself
and
indeed
it
is
but
for
a
moment
for
it
does
not
long
enjoy
that
wretched
oblivion
but
is
most
dreadfully
wounded
by
the
remembrance
which
is
perpetually
recurring
of
the
divine
judgment
in
short
no
man
is
truly
a
believer
unless
he
be
firmly
persuaded
that
god
is
a
propitious
and
benevolent
father
to
him
and
promise
himself
every
thing
from
his
goodness
unless
he
depend
on
the
promises
of
the
divine
benevolence
to
him
and
feel
an
undoubted
expectation
of
salvation
as
the
apostle
shows
in
these
words
if
we
hold
fast
the
beginning
of
our
confidence
steadfast
unto
the
here
he
supposes
that
no
man
has
a
good
hope
in
the
lord
who
does
not
glory
with
confidence
in
being
an
heir
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
he
is
no
believer
i
say
who
does
not
rely
on
the
security
of
his
salvation
and
confidently
triumph
over
the
devil
and
death
as
paul
teaches
us
in
this
remarkable
peroration
i
am
persuaded
says
he
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
powers
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
thus
the
same
apostle
is
of
opinion
that
the
eyes
of
our
understanding
are
not
truly
enlightened
unless
we
discover
what
is
the
hope
of
the
eternal
inheritance
to
which
we
are
called
and
he
every
where
inculcates
that
we
have
no
just
apprehensions
of
the
divine
goodness
unless
we
derive
from
it
a
considerable
degree
of
assurance
xvii
but
some
one
will
object
that
the
experience
of
believers
is
very
different
from
this
for
that
in
recognizing
the
grace
of
god
towards
them
they
are
not
only
disturbed
with
inquietude
which
frequently
befalls
them
but
sometimes
also
tremble
with
the
most
distressing
terrors
the
vehemence
of
temptations
to
agitate
their
minds
is
so
great
that
it
appears
scarcely
compatible
with
that
assurance
of
faith
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
we
must
therefore
solve
this
difficulty
if
we
mean
to
support
the
doctrine
we
have
advanced
when
we
inculcate
that
faith
ought
to
be
certain
and
secure
we
conceive
not
of
a
certainty
attended
with
no
doubt
or
of
a
security
interrupted
by
no
anxiety
but
we
rather
affirm
that
believers
have
a
perpetual
conflict
with
their
own
diffidence
and
are
far
from
placing
their
consciences
in
a
placid
calm
never
disturbed
by
any
storms
yet
on
the
other
hand
we
deny
however
they
may
be
afflicted
that
they
ever
fall
and
depart
from
that
certain
confidence
which
they
have
conceived
in
the
divine
mercy
the
scripture
proposes
no
example
of
faith
more
illustrious
or
memorable
than
david
especially
if
you
consider
the
whole
course
of
his
life
yet
that
his
mind
was
not
invariably
serene
appears
from
his
innumerable
complaints
of
which
it
will
be
sufficient
to
select
a
few
when
he
rebukes
his
soul
for
turbulent
emotions
is
he
not
angry
with
his
unbelief
why
says
he
art
thou
cast
down
o
my
soul
and
why
art
thou
disquieted
in
me
hope
thou
in
and
certainly
that
consternation
was
an
evident
proof
of
diffidence
as
though
he
supposed
himself
to
be
forsaken
by
god
in
another
place
also
we
find
a
more
ample
confession
i
said
in
my
haste
i
am
cut
off
from
before
thine
in
another
place
also
he
debates
with
himself
in
anxious
and
miserable
perplexity
and
even
raises
a
dispute
concerning
the
nature
of
god
hath
god
forgotten
to
be
gracious
will
the
lord
cast
off
for
ever
what
follows
is
still
harsher
and
i
said
i
must
fall
these
are
the
changes
of
the
right
hand
of
the
most
for
in
a
state
of
despair
he
consigns
himself
to
ruin
and
not
only
confesses
that
he
is
agitated
with
doubts
but
as
vanquished
in
the
conflict
considers
all
as
lost
because
god
has
deserted
him
and
turned
to
his
destruction
that
hand
which
used
to
support
him
wherefore
it
is
not
without
reason
that
he
says
return
unto
thy
rest
o
my
soul
since
he
had
experienced
such
fluctuations
amidst
the
waves
of
trouble
and
yet
wonderful
as
it
is
amidst
these
concussions
faith
sustains
the
hearts
of
the
pious
and
truly
resembles
the
rising
with
vigour
undiminished
by
any
burdens
which
may
be
laid
upon
it
but
which
can
never
retard
its
growth
as
david
when
he
might
appear
to
be
overwhelmed
yet
chiding
himself
ceased
not
to
aspire
towards
god
indeed
he
who
contending
with
his
own
infirmity
strives
in
his
anxieties
to
exercise
faith
is
already
in
a
great
measure
victorious
which
we
may
infer
from
such
passages
as
this
wait
on
the
lord
be
of
good
courage
and
he
shall
strengthen
thine
heart
wait
i
say
on
the
he
reproves
himself
for
timidity
and
repeating
the
same
twice
confesses
himself
to
be
frequently
subject
to
various
agitations
in
the
mean
time
he
is
not
only
displeased
with
himself
for
these
faults
but
ardently
aspires
towards
the
correction
of
them
now
if
we
enter
into
a
close
and
correct
examination
of
his
character
and
conduct
and
compare
him
with
ahaz
we
shall
discover
a
considerable
difference
isaiah
is
sent
to
convey
consolation
to
the
anxiety
of
the
impious
and
hypocritical
king
he
addresses
him
in
these
words
take
heed
and
be
quiet
fear
not
but
what
effect
had
the
message
on
him
as
it
had
been
before
said
that
his
heart
was
moved
as
the
trees
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind
though
he
heard
the
promise
he
ceased
not
to
tremble
this
therefore
is
the
proper
reward
and
punishment
of
to
tremble
with
fear
that
he
who
opens
not
the
gate
to
himself
by
faith
in
the
time
of
temptation
departs
from
god
but
on
the
contrary
believers
whom
the
weight
of
temptations
bends
and
almost
oppresses
constantly
emerge
from
their
distresses
though
not
without
trouble
and
difficulty
and
because
they
are
conscious
of
their
own
imbecility
they
pray
with
the
psalmist
take
not
the
word
of
truth
utterly
out
of
my
by
these
words
we
are
taught
that
they
sometimes
become
dumb
as
though
their
faith
were
destroyed
yet
that
they
neither
fail
nor
turn
their
backs
but
persevere
in
their
conflict
and
arouse
their
inactivity
by
prayer
that
they
may
not
be
stupefied
by
xviii
to
render
this
intelligible
it
is
necessary
to
recur
to
that
division
of
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
which
we
noticed
in
another
place
and
which
most
clearly
discovers
itself
in
this
case
the
pious
heart
therefore
perceives
a
division
in
itself
being
partly
affected
with
delight
through
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
goodness
partly
distressed
with
sorrow
through
a
sense
of
its
own
calamity
partly
relying
on
the
promise
of
the
gospel
partly
trembling
at
the
evidence
of
its
own
iniquity
partly
exulting
in
the
apprehension
of
life
partly
alarmed
by
the
fear
of
death
this
variation
happens
through
the
imperfection
of
faith
since
we
are
never
so
happy
during
the
present
life
as
to
be
cured
of
all
diffidence
and
entirely
filled
and
possessed
by
faith
hence
those
conflicts
in
which
the
diffidence
which
adheres
to
the
relics
of
the
flesh
rises
up
in
opposition
to
the
faith
formed
in
the
heart
but
if
in
the
mind
of
a
believer
assurance
be
mixed
with
doubts
do
we
not
always
come
to
this
point
that
faith
consists
not
in
a
certain
and
clear
but
only
in
an
obscure
and
perplexed
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
respecting
us
not
at
all
for
if
we
are
distracted
by
various
thoughts
we
are
not
therefore
entirely
divested
of
faith
neither
though
harassed
by
the
agitations
of
diffidence
are
we
therefore
immerged
in
its
abyss
nor
if
we
be
shaken
are
we
therefore
overthrown
for
the
invariable
issue
of
this
contest
is
that
faith
at
length
surmounts
those
difficulties
from
which
while
it
is
encompassed
with
them
it
appears
to
be
in
danger
xix
let
us
sum
it
up
thus
as
soon
as
the
smallest
particle
of
grace
is
infused
into
our
minds
we
begin
to
contemplate
the
divine
countenance
as
now
placid
serene
and
propitious
to
us
it
is
indeed
a
very
distant
prospect
but
so
clear
that
we
know
we
are
not
deceived
afterwards
in
proportion
as
we
improve
we
ought
to
be
continually
improving
by
progressive
advances
arrive
at
a
nearer
and
therefore
more
certain
view
of
him
and
by
continual
habit
he
becomes
more
familiar
to
us
thus
we
see
that
a
mind
illuminated
by
the
knowledge
of
god
is
at
first
involved
in
much
ignorance
which
is
removed
by
slow
degrees
yet
it
is
not
prevented
either
by
its
ignorance
of
some
things
or
by
its
obscure
view
of
what
it
beholds
from
enjoying
a
clear
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
respecting
itself
which
is
the
first
and
principal
exercise
of
faith
for
as
a
man
who
is
confined
in
a
prison
into
which
the
sun
shines
only
obliquely
and
partially
through
a
very
small
window
is
deprived
of
a
full
view
of
that
luminary
yet
clearly
perceives
its
splendour
and
experiences
its
beneficial
influence
we
who
are
bound
with
terrestrial
and
corporeal
fetters
though
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
great
obscurity
are
nevertheless
illuminated
sufficiently
for
all
the
purposes
of
real
security
by
the
light
of
god
shining
ever
so
feebly
to
discover
his
mercy
xx
the
apostle
beautifully
inculcates
both
these
ideas
in
various
places
for
when
he
says
that
we
know
in
part
and
we
prophesy
in
part
and
see
through
a
glass
darkly
he
indicates
how
very
slender
a
portion
of
that
wisdom
which
is
truly
divine
is
conferred
upon
us
in
the
present
life
for
although
these
words
imply
not
only
that
faith
remains
imperfect
as
long
as
we
groan
under
the
burden
of
the
flesh
but
that
our
imperfection
renders
it
necessary
for
us
to
be
unremittingly
employed
in
acquiring
further
knowledge
yet
he
suggests
that
it
is
impossible
for
our
narrow
capacity
to
comprehend
that
which
is
infinite
and
this
paul
predicates
concerning
the
whole
church
though
every
individual
of
us
is
obstructed
and
retarded
by
his
own
ignorance
from
making
that
progress
which
might
be
wished
but
what
a
sure
and
certain
experience
of
itself
even
the
smallest
particle
of
faith
gives
us
the
same
apostle
shows
in
another
place
where
he
asserts
that
we
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
lord
are
changed
into
the
same
such
profound
ignorance
must
necessarily
involve
much
doubt
and
trepidation
especially
as
our
hearts
are
by
a
kind
of
natural
instinct
inclined
to
unbelief
besides
temptations
various
and
innumerable
frequently
assail
us
with
great
violence
above
all
our
own
conscience
oppressed
by
its
incumbent
load
of
sin
sometimes
complains
and
groans
within
itself
sometimes
accuses
itself
sometimes
murmurs
in
secret
and
sometimes
is
openly
disturbed
whether
therefore
adversity
discover
the
wrath
of
god
or
the
conscience
find
in
itself
any
reason
or
cause
of
it
thence
unbelief
derives
weapons
to
oppose
faith
which
are
perpetually
directed
to
this
object
to
persuade
us
that
god
is
angry
with
us
and
inimical
to
us
that
we
may
not
hope
for
any
assistance
from
him
but
may
dread
him
as
our
irreconcilable
enemy
xxi
to
sustain
these
attacks
faith
arms
and
defends
itself
with
the
word
of
the
lord
and
when
such
a
temptation
as
this
assails
us
god
is
our
enemy
because
he
is
angry
with
us
on
the
contrary
objects
that
he
is
merciful
even
when
he
afflicts
because
chastisement
proceeds
rather
from
love
than
from
wrath
when
it
is
pressed
with
this
thought
that
god
is
an
avenger
of
iniquities
it
opposes
the
pardon
provided
for
all
offences
whenever
the
sinner
makes
application
to
the
divine
clemency
thus
the
pious
mind
how
strangely
soever
it
may
be
agitated
and
harassed
rises
at
length
superior
to
all
difficulties
nor
ever
suffers
its
confidence
in
the
divine
mercy
to
be
shaken
the
various
disputes
which
exercise
and
fatigue
it
terminate
rather
in
the
confirmation
of
that
confidence
it
is
a
proof
of
this
that
when
the
saints
conceive
themselves
to
feel
most
the
vengeance
of
god
they
still
confide
their
complaints
to
him
and
when
there
is
no
appearance
of
his
hearing
them
they
continue
to
call
upon
him
for
what
end
would
be
answered
by
addressing
complaint
to
him
from
whom
they
expected
no
consolation
and
they
would
never
be
disposed
to
call
upon
him
unless
they
believed
him
to
be
ready
to
assist
them
thus
the
disciples
whom
christ
reprehends
for
the
weakness
of
their
faith
complained
indeed
that
they
were
perishing
but
still
they
implored
his
assistance
nor
when
he
chides
them
on
account
of
their
weak
faith
does
he
reject
them
from
the
number
of
his
children
or
class
them
with
unbelievers
but
he
excites
them
to
correct
that
fault
therefore
we
repeat
the
assertion
already
made
that
faith
is
never
eradicated
from
a
pious
heart
but
continues
firmly
fixed
however
it
may
be
shaken
and
seem
to
bend
this
way
or
that
that
its
light
is
never
so
extinguished
or
smothered
but
that
it
lies
at
least
concealed
under
embers
and
that
this
is
an
evident
proof
that
the
word
which
is
an
incorruptible
seed
produces
fruit
similar
to
itself
whose
germ
never
entirely
perishes
for
though
it
is
the
last
cause
of
despair
that
can
happen
to
saints
to
perceive
according
to
their
apprehension
of
present
circumstances
the
hand
of
god
lifted
up
for
their
destruction
yet
job
asserts
the
extent
of
his
hope
to
be
such
that
though
he
should
be
slain
by
him
he
would
continue
to
trust
in
him
this
then
is
the
real
state
of
the
case
unbelief
is
not
inwardly
predominant
in
the
hearts
of
the
pious
but
it
assails
them
from
without
nor
do
its
weapons
mortally
wound
them
they
only
molest
them
or
at
least
inflict
such
wounds
as
are
curable
for
faith
according
to
paul
serves
us
as
a
shield
which
being
opposed
to
hostile
weapons
receives
their
blows
and
entirely
repels
them
or
at
least
breaks
their
force
so
that
they
penetrate
no
vital
part
when
faith
is
shaken
therefore
it
is
just
as
if
a
soldier
otherwise
bold
were
constrained
by
a
violent
stroke
of
a
javelin
to
change
his
position
and
retreat
a
little
but
when
faith
itself
is
wounded
it
is
just
as
if
his
shield
were
broken
by
a
blow
yet
not
pierced
through
for
the
pious
mind
will
always
recover
so
far
as
to
say
with
david
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
to
walk
in
the
gloom
of
death
is
certainly
terrible
and
believers
whatever
degree
of
firmness
they
have
can
not
but
dread
it
but
when
this
thought
prevails
that
god
is
present
with
them
and
concerned
for
their
salvation
fear
at
once
gives
way
to
security
but
as
augustine
says
whatever
powerful
engines
the
devil
erects
against
us
when
he
possesses
not
the
heart
which
is
the
residence
of
faith
he
is
kept
at
a
distance
thus
if
we
judge
from
the
event
believers
not
only
escape
in
safety
from
every
battle
so
that
receiving
an
accession
of
vigour
they
are
soon
after
prepared
to
enter
the
field
again
but
we
see
the
accomplishment
of
what
john
says
in
his
canonical
epistle
this
is
the
victory
that
overcometh
the
world
even
our
for
he
affirms
that
it
will
be
not
only
victorious
in
one
or
in
a
few
battles
or
against
some
particular
assault
but
that
it
will
overcome
the
whole
world
though
it
should
be
attacked
a
thousand
times
xxii
there
is
another
species
of
fear
and
trembling
by
which
nevertheless
the
assurance
of
faith
is
so
far
from
being
impaired
that
it
is
more
firmly
established
that
is
when
believers
considering
the
examples
of
the
divine
vengeance
against
the
impious
as
lessons
given
to
them
are
solicitously
cautious
not
to
provoke
the
wrath
of
god
against
themselves
by
the
same
crimes
or
when
feeling
their
own
misery
they
learn
to
place
all
their
dependence
on
the
lord
without
whom
they
perceive
themselves
to
be
more
inconstant
and
transient
than
the
wind
for
when
the
apostle
by
a
representation
of
the
punishments
which
the
lord
formerly
inflicted
on
the
israelitish
nation
alarms
the
fears
of
the
corinthians
lest
they
should
involve
themselves
in
the
same
calamities
he
in
no
respect
weakens
their
confidence
but
shakes
off
the
indolence
of
the
flesh
by
which
faith
is
rather
impaired
than
confirmed
nor
when
from
the
fall
of
the
jews
he
takes
an
occasion
to
exhort
him
that
standeth
to
beware
lest
he
fall
does
he
direct
us
to
waver
as
though
we
were
uncertain
of
our
stability
but
only
forbids
all
arrogance
and
presumptuous
overweening
confidence
in
our
own
strength
that
the
gentiles
may
not
proudly
insult
over
the
expelled
jews
into
whose
place
they
have
been
received
in
that
passage
however
he
not
only
addresses
believers
but
in
his
discourse
also
includes
hypocrites
who
gloried
merely
in
external
appearance
for
he
admonishes
not
men
individually
but
instituting
a
comparison
between
the
jews
and
the
gentiles
after
having
shown
that
the
rejection
of
the
former
was
a
righteous
punishment
for
their
unbelief
and
ingratitude
he
exhorts
the
latter
not
to
lose
by
pride
and
haughtiness
the
grace
of
adoption
recently
transferred
to
them
but
as
in
the
general
rejection
of
the
jews
there
remained
some
of
them
who
fell
not
from
the
covenant
of
adoption
so
among
the
gentiles
there
might
possibly
arise
some
who
destitute
of
true
faith
would
only
be
inflated
with
foolish
and
carnal
confidence
and
thus
abuse
the
goodness
of
god
to
their
own
ruin
but
though
you
should
understand
this
to
be
spoken
to
the
elect
and
believers
no
inconvenience
would
result
from
it
for
it
is
one
thing
to
repress
the
temerity
which
from
remaining
carnality
sometimes
discovers
itself
in
the
saints
that
it
may
not
produce
vain
confidence
and
another
to
strike
the
conscience
with
fear
that
it
may
not
rely
with
full
security
on
the
mercy
of
god
xxiii
moreover
when
he
teaches
us
to
work
out
our
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
he
only
requires
us
to
accustom
ourselves
with
great
to
look
up
to
the
power
of
the
lord
for
nothing
arouses
us
to
repose
all
confidence
and
assurance
of
mind
on
the
lord
so
much
as
diffidence
of
ourselves
and
anxiety
arising
from
a
consciousness
of
our
own
misery
in
which
sense
we
must
understand
this
declaration
of
the
psalmist
i
will
come
into
thy
house
in
the
multitude
of
thy
mercy
and
in
thy
fear
will
i
whence
he
beautifully
connects
the
confidence
of
faith
which
relies
on
the
mercy
of
god
with
that
religious
fear
by
which
we
ought
to
be
affected
whenever
we
come
into
the
presence
of
the
divine
majesty
and
from
its
splendour
discover
our
extreme
impurity
solomon
also
truly
pronounces
happy
is
the
man
who
feareth
alway
but
he
that
hardeneth
his
heart
shall
fall
into
but
he
intends
that
fear
which
will
render
us
more
cautious
not
such
as
would
afflict
and
ruin
us
such
as
when
the
mind
confounded
in
itself
recovers
itself
in
god
dejected
in
itself
finds
consolation
in
him
and
despairing
of
itself
revives
with
confidence
in
him
wherefore
nothing
prevents
believers
from
being
distressed
with
fear
and
at
the
same
time
enjoying
the
most
serene
consolation
as
they
now
turn
their
eyes
towards
their
own
vanity
and
now
direct
the
attention
of
their
mind
to
the
truth
of
god
how
can
fear
and
faith
it
will
be
asked
both
reside
in
the
same
mind
just
as
on
the
contrary
insensibility
and
anxiety
for
though
the
impious
endeavour
to
acquire
a
habit
of
insensibility
that
they
may
not
be
disquieted
by
the
fear
of
god
the
judgment
of
god
follows
them
so
closely
that
they
can
not
attain
the
object
of
their
desires
so
nothing
prevents
god
from
training
his
people
to
humility
that
in
their
valiant
warfare
they
may
restrain
themselves
within
the
bounds
of
modesty
and
that
this
was
the
design
of
the
apostle
appears
from
the
context
where
as
the
cause
of
fear
and
trembling
he
assigns
the
good
pleasure
of
god
by
which
he
gives
to
his
people
both
rightly
to
will
and
strenuously
to
perform
in
the
same
sense
we
should
understand
this
prediction
the
children
of
israel
shall
fear
the
lord
and
his
goodness
for
not
only
piety
produces
a
reverence
of
god
but
also
the
sweetness
of
grace
fills
a
man
that
is
dejected
in
himself
with
fear
and
admiration
causing
him
to
depend
upon
god
and
humbly
submit
himself
to
his
power
xxiv
yet
we
give
no
encouragement
to
the
very
pestilent
philosophy
begun
to
be
broached
by
some
in
the
present
day
for
being
unable
to
defend
that
gross
notion
of
faith
as
a
doubtful
opinion
which
has
been
taught
in
the
schools
they
resort
to
another
invention
and
propose
a
confidence
mixed
with
unbelief
they
confess
that
whenever
we
look
to
christ
we
find
in
him
a
sufficient
ground
of
comfortable
hope
but
because
we
are
always
unworthy
of
all
those
blessings
which
are
offered
to
us
in
christ
they
wish
us
to
fluctuate
and
hesitate
in
the
view
of
our
own
unworthiness
in
short
they
place
the
conscience
in
such
a
state
between
hope
and
fear
that
it
alternately
inclines
to
both
they
also
connect
hope
and
fear
together
so
that
when
the
former
rises
it
depresses
the
latter
and
when
the
latter
lifts
its
head
the
former
falls
thus
satan
finding
that
those
open
engines
which
he
heretofore
employed
to
destroy
the
assurance
of
faith
are
now
no
longer
of
any
avail
secretly
endeavours
to
undermine
it
but
what
kind
of
confidence
would
that
be
which
should
frequently
give
way
to
despair
if
you
consider
christ
say
they
salvation
is
certain
if
you
return
to
yourself
condemnation
is
certain
diffidence
and
good
hope
therefore
must
of
necessity
alternately
prevail
in
your
mind
as
though
we
ought
to
consider
christ
as
standing
apart
from
us
and
not
rather
as
dwelling
within
us
for
we
therefore
expect
salvation
from
him
not
because
he
appears
to
us
at
a
great
distance
but
because
having
ingrafted
us
into
his
body
he
makes
us
partakers
not
only
of
all
his
benefits
but
also
of
himself
wherefore
i
thus
retort
their
own
argument
if
you
consider
yourself
condemnation
is
certain
but
since
christ
with
all
his
benefits
is
communicated
to
you
so
that
all
that
he
has
becomes
yours
and
you
become
a
member
of
him
and
one
with
him
righteousness
covers
your
sins
his
salvation
supersedes
your
condemnation
he
interposes
with
his
merit
that
your
unworthiness
may
not
appear
in
the
divine
presence
indeed
the
truth
is
that
we
ought
by
no
means
to
separate
christ
from
us
or
ourselves
from
him
but
with
all
our
might
firmly
to
retain
that
fellowship
by
which
he
has
united
us
to
himself
thus
the
apostle
teaches
us
the
body
says
he
is
dead
because
of
sin
but
the
spirit
is
life
because
of
according
to
this
frivolous
notion
of
these
persons
he
ought
to
have
said
christ
indeed
has
life
in
himself
but
you
being
sinners
remain
obnoxious
to
death
and
condemnation
but
he
speaks
in
a
very
different
manner
for
he
states
that
the
condemnation
which
we
demerit
in
ourselves
is
swallowed
up
by
the
salvation
of
christ
and
in
confirmation
of
this
uses
the
same
argument
as
i
have
adduced
that
christ
is
not
without
us
but
dwells
within
us
and
not
only
adheres
to
us
by
an
indissoluble
connection
of
fellowship
but
by
a
certain
wonderful
communion
coalesces
daily
more
and
more
into
one
body
with
us
till
he
becomes
altogether
one
with
us
nor
do
i
deny
what
i
have
lately
said
that
some
interruptions
of
faith
at
times
occur
as
its
imbecility
is
by
the
force
of
violence
inclined
to
this
or
the
other
direction
thus
in
the
thick
gloom
of
temptations
its
light
is
smothered
but
whatever
befalls
it
it
never
discontinues
its
efforts
in
seeking
god
xxv
bernard
reasons
in
a
similar
manner
when
he
professedly
discusses
this
subject
in
the
fifth
homily
on
the
dedication
of
the
temple
by
the
goodness
of
god
meditating
sometimes
on
the
soul
i
think
i
discover
in
it
as
it
were
two
opposite
characters
if
i
view
it
as
it
is
in
itself
and
of
itself
i
can
not
utter
a
greater
truth
concerning
it
than
that
it
is
reduced
to
nothing
what
need
is
there
at
present
to
enumerate
all
its
miseries
how
it
is
loaded
with
sins
enveloped
in
darkness
entangled
with
allurements
inflamed
with
inordinate
desires
subject
to
the
passions
filled
with
illusions
always
prone
to
evil
inclined
to
every
vice
and
finally
full
of
ignominy
and
confusion
now
if
even
our
righteousnesses
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
truth
be
found
to
be
as
filthy
rags
what
judgment
will
be
formed
of
our
acknowledged
unrighteousness
if
the
light
that
is
in
us
be
darkness
how
great
is
that
darkness
what
then
man
is
undoubtedly
become
like
vanity
man
is
reduced
to
nothing
man
is
nothing
yet
how
is
he
entirely
nothing
whom
god
magnifies
how
is
he
nothing
on
whom
the
heart
of
god
is
fixed
brethren
let
us
revive
again
although
we
are
nothing
in
our
own
hearts
perhaps
there
may
be
something
for
us
latent
in
the
heart
of
god
o
father
of
mercies
o
father
of
the
miserable
how
dost
thou
fix
thine
heart
on
us
for
thine
heart
is
where
thy
treasure
is
but
how
are
we
thy
treasure
if
we
are
nothing
all
nations
are
before
thee
as
though
they
existed
not
they
must
be
considered
as
nothing
that
is
before
thee
not
within
thee
thus
it
is
in
the
judgment
of
thy
truth
but
not
thus
in
the
affection
of
thy
clemency
thou
callest
things
which
are
not
as
though
they
were
and
therefore
they
are
not
because
thou
callest
things
which
are
not
yet
they
are
because
thou
callest
them
for
though
they
are
not
with
reference
to
themselves
yet
with
thee
they
are
according
to
this
expression
of
paul
not
of
works
but
of
him
that
after
this
bernard
says
that
there
is
a
wonderful
connection
between
these
two
considerations
things
which
are
connected
with
each
other
certainly
do
not
reciprocally
destroy
each
other
which
he
also
more
plainly
declares
in
the
following
conclusion
now
if
we
diligently
examine
what
we
are
in
both
considerations
in
one
view
we
are
nothing
and
in
the
other
how
we
are
magnified
conceive
that
our
boasting
appears
to
be
restrained
but
perhaps
it
is
more
increased
and
indeed
established
that
we
may
glory
not
in
ourselves
but
in
the
lord
if
we
reflect
if
he
has
decreed
to
save
us
we
shall
shortly
be
delivered
this
is
sufficient
to
recover
us
but
ascending
to
a
loftier
and
more
extensive
prospect
let
us
seek
the
city
of
god
let
us
seek
his
temple
let
us
seek
his
palace
let
us
seek
his
spouse
i
have
not
forgotten
but
with
fear
and
reverence
i
say
we
are
but
in
the
heart
of
god
we
are
but
by
his
condescending
favour
not
by
our
own
xxvi
now
the
fear
of
the
lord
which
is
universally
ascribed
to
all
the
saints
and
which
is
called
sometimes
the
beginning
of
wisdom
sometimes
wisdom
itself
although
it
be
but
one
proceeds
from
a
twofold
apprehension
of
him
for
god
requires
the
reverence
of
a
father
and
of
a
master
therefore
he
who
truly
desires
to
worship
him
will
study
to
pay
him
the
obedience
of
a
son
and
the
submission
of
a
servant
the
lord
by
the
prophet
distinguishes
the
obedience
which
is
paid
to
him
as
a
father
by
the
appellation
of
honour
and
the
service
which
he
receives
as
a
master
by
that
of
fear
a
son
says
he
honoureth
his
father
and
a
servant
his
master
if
then
i
be
a
father
where
is
mine
honour
and
if
i
be
a
master
where
is
my
fear
but
notwithstanding
his
distinction
between
them
you
see
how
he
confounds
them
together
let
the
fear
of
the
lord
therefore
with
us
be
a
reverence
mingled
with
this
honour
and
fear
nor
is
it
surprising
that
the
same
mind
cherishes
both
these
affections
for
he
who
considers
what
a
father
god
is
to
us
has
ample
reason
even
though
there
were
no
hell
to
dread
his
displeasure
more
than
any
death
but
such
is
the
propensity
of
our
nature
to
the
licentiousness
of
transgression
that
in
order
to
restrain
it
by
every
possible
method
we
should
at
the
same
time
indulge
this
reflection
that
all
iniquity
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
under
whose
power
we
live
and
whose
vengeance
they
will
not
escape
who
provoke
his
wrath
against
them
by
the
wickedness
of
their
lives
xxvii
now
the
assertion
of
john
that
there
is
no
fear
in
love
but
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
because
fear
hath
torment
is
not
at
all
repugnant
to
what
we
have
advanced
for
he
speaks
of
the
terror
of
unbelief
between
which
and
the
fear
of
believers
there
is
a
wide
difference
for
the
impious
fear
not
god
from
a
dread
of
incurring
his
displeasure
if
they
could
do
it
with
impunity
but
because
they
know
him
to
be
armed
with
vindictive
power
they
tremble
with
horror
at
hearing
of
his
wrath
and
thus
also
they
fear
his
wrath
because
they
apprehend
it
to
be
impending
over
them
because
they
every
moment
expect
it
to
fall
on
their
heads
but
the
faithful
as
we
have
observed
fear
his
displeasure
more
than
punishment
and
are
not
disturbed
with
the
fear
of
punishment
as
though
it
were
impending
over
them
but
are
rendered
more
cautious
that
they
may
not
incur
it
thus
the
apostle
when
addressing
believers
says
let
no
man
deceive
you
with
vain
words
for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
or
unbelief
he
threatens
not
its
descending
on
them
but
admonishes
them
to
consider
the
wrath
of
the
lord
prepared
for
the
impious
on
account
of
the
crimes
which
he
had
enumerated
that
they
may
avoid
tempting
it
it
seldom
happens
however
that
the
reprobate
are
aroused
merely
by
simple
threatenings
but
on
the
contrary
being
already
obdurate
and
insensible
when
god
thunders
from
heaven
if
it
be
only
in
words
they
rather
harden
themselves
in
rebellion
but
when
they
feel
the
stroke
of
his
hand
they
are
compelled
to
fear
him
whether
they
will
or
not
this
is
commonly
called
a
servile
fear
in
opposition
to
a
filial
fear
which
is
ingenuous
and
voluntary
some
persons
curiously
introduce
an
intermediate
species
of
fear
because
that
servile
and
constrained
affection
sometimes
subdues
men
s
minds
so
that
they
voluntarily
approach
to
the
fear
of
god
xxviii
now
in
the
divine
benevolence
which
is
affirmed
to
be
the
object
of
faith
we
apprehend
the
possession
of
salvation
and
everlasting
life
to
be
obtained
for
if
no
good
can
be
wanting
when
god
is
propitious
we
have
a
sufficient
certainty
of
salvation
when
he
himself
assures
us
of
his
love
o
god
cause
thy
face
to
shine
and
we
shall
be
saved
says
the
psalmist
hence
the
scriptures
represent
this
as
the
sum
of
our
salvation
that
he
has
abolished
all
enmity
and
received
us
into
his
favour
in
which
they
imply
that
since
god
is
reconciled
to
us
there
remains
no
danger
but
that
all
things
will
prosper
with
us
wherefore
faith
having
apprehended
the
love
of
god
has
promises
for
the
present
life
and
the
life
to
come
and
a
solid
assurance
of
all
blessings
but
it
is
such
an
assurance
as
may
be
derived
from
the
divine
word
for
faith
certainly
promises
itself
neither
longevity
nor
honour
nor
wealth
in
the
present
state
since
the
lord
has
not
been
pleased
to
appoint
any
of
these
things
for
us
but
is
contented
with
this
assurance
that
whatever
we
may
want
of
the
conveniences
or
necessaries
of
this
life
yet
god
will
never
leave
us
but
its
principal
security
consists
in
an
expectation
of
the
future
life
which
is
placed
beyond
all
doubt
by
the
word
of
god
for
whatever
miseries
and
calamities
may
on
earth
await
those
who
are
the
objects
of
the
love
of
god
they
can
not
prevent
the
divine
benevolence
from
being
a
source
of
complete
felicity
therefore
when
we
meant
to
express
the
perfection
of
blessedness
we
have
mentioned
the
grace
of
god
as
the
fountain
from
which
every
species
of
blessings
flows
down
to
us
and
we
may
generally
observe
in
the
scriptures
that
when
they
treat
not
only
of
eternal
salvation
but
of
any
blessing
we
enjoy
our
attention
is
recalled
to
the
love
of
god
for
which
reason
david
says
that
the
of
god
when
experienced
in
a
pious
heart
is
better
and
more
desirable
than
life
itself
finally
if
we
have
an
abundance
of
all
things
to
the
extent
of
our
desires
but
are
uncertain
of
the
love
or
hatred
of
god
our
prosperity
will
be
cursed
and
therefore
miserable
but
if
the
paternal
countenance
of
god
shine
on
us
even
our
miseries
will
be
blessed
because
they
will
be
converted
into
aids
of
our
salvation
thus
paul
after
an
enumeration
of
all
possible
adversities
glories
that
they
can
never
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
and
in
his
prayers
he
always
begins
with
the
grace
of
god
from
which
all
prosperity
proceeds
david
likewise
opposes
the
divine
favour
alone
against
all
the
terrors
which
disturb
us
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
says
he
i
will
fear
no
evil
for
thou
art
with
and
we
always
feel
our
minds
wavering
unless
contented
with
the
grace
of
god
they
seek
their
peace
in
it
and
are
deeply
impressed
with
the
sentiment
of
the
psalmist
blessed
is
the
nation
whose
god
is
the
lord
and
the
people
whom
he
hath
chosen
for
his
own
xxix
we
make
the
foundation
of
faith
to
be
the
gratuitous
promise
for
on
that
faith
properly
rests
for
although
faith
admits
the
veracity
of
god
in
all
things
whether
he
command
or
prohibit
whether
he
promise
or
threaten
though
it
obediently
receives
his
injunctions
carefully
observes
his
prohibitions
and
attends
to
his
threatenings
with
the
promise
it
properly
begins
on
that
it
stands
and
in
that
it
ends
for
it
seeks
in
god
for
life
which
is
found
not
in
precepts
nor
in
denunciations
of
punishments
but
in
the
promise
of
mercy
and
in
that
only
which
is
gratuitous
for
a
conditional
promise
which
sends
us
back
to
our
own
works
promises
life
to
us
only
if
we
find
it
in
ourselves
therefore
if
we
wish
our
faith
not
to
tremble
and
waver
we
must
support
it
with
the
promise
of
salvation
which
is
voluntarily
and
liberally
offered
us
by
the
lord
rather
in
consideration
of
our
misery
than
in
respect
of
our
worthiness
wherefore
the
apostle
denominates
the
gospel
the
word
of
faith
a
character
which
he
denies
both
to
the
precepts
and
to
the
promises
of
the
law
since
there
is
nothing
that
can
establish
faith
but
that
liberal
embassy
by
which
god
reconciles
the
world
to
himself
hence
also
the
same
apostle
frequently
connects
faith
with
the
gospel
as
when
he
states
that
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
was
committed
to
him
for
obedience
to
the
faith
that
it
is
the
power
of
god
unto
salvation
to
every
one
that
believeth
that
therein
is
the
righteousness
of
god
revealed
from
faith
to
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
the
gospel
being
the
ministry
of
reconciliation
there
is
no
other
sufficient
testimony
of
the
divine
benevolence
towards
us
the
knowledge
of
which
is
necessary
to
faith
when
we
assert
therefore
that
faith
rests
on
the
gratuitous
promise
we
deny
not
that
believers
embrace
and
revere
every
part
of
the
divine
word
but
we
point
out
the
promise
of
mercy
as
the
peculiar
object
of
faith
thus
believers
ought
to
acknowledge
god
as
a
judge
and
avenger
of
crimes
yet
they
fix
their
eyes
peculiarly
on
his
clemency
described
for
their
contemplation
as
gracious
and
full
of
compassion
slow
to
anger
and
of
great
mercy
good
to
all
and
diffusing
his
tender
mercies
over
all
his
xxx
nor
do
i
regard
the
clamours
of
pighius
or
any
such
snarlers
who
censure
this
restriction
as
though
it
divided
faith
and
comprehended
only
one
branch
of
it
i
grant
that
as
i
have
already
said
the
general
object
of
faith
as
they
express
themselves
is
the
veracity
of
god
whether
he
threaten
or
give
us
a
hope
of
his
grace
wherefore
the
apostle
attributes
this
to
faith
that
noah
feared
the
destruction
of
the
world
while
it
was
yet
unseen
if
the
fear
of
impending
punishment
was
the
work
of
faith
threatenings
ought
not
to
be
excluded
from
the
definition
of
it
this
indeed
is
true
but
these
cavillers
unjustly
charge
us
with
denying
that
faith
respects
every
part
of
the
word
of
god
for
we
only
intend
to
establish
these
two
points
first
that
it
never
stands
firmly
till
it
comes
to
the
gratuitous
promise
secondly
that
we
are
reconciled
to
god
only
as
it
unites
us
to
christ
both
these
points
are
worthy
of
observation
we
are
inquiring
for
a
faith
which
may
distinguish
the
sons
of
god
from
the
reprobate
and
believers
from
unbelievers
if
any
man
believes
the
justice
of
the
divine
commands
and
the
truth
of
the
divine
threatenings
must
he
therefore
be
called
a
believer
by
no
means
therefore
faith
can
have
no
stability
unless
it
be
placed
on
the
divine
mercy
now
to
what
purpose
do
we
argue
concerning
faith
is
it
not
that
we
may
understand
the
way
of
salvation
but
how
is
faith
saving
but
by
ingrafting
us
into
the
body
of
christ
there
will
be
no
absurdity
then
if
in
the
definition
of
it
we
insist
on
its
principal
effect
and
as
a
difference
add
to
the
genus
that
character
which
separates
believers
from
unbelievers
in
a
word
these
malevolent
men
have
nothing
to
carp
at
in
this
doctrine
without
involving
in
the
same
reprehension
with
us
the
apostle
paul
who
particularly
styles
the
gospel
the
word
of
xxxi
hence
again
we
infer
what
has
been
before
stated
that
the
word
is
as
necessary
to
faith
as
the
living
root
of
the
tree
is
to
the
fruit
because
according
to
david
none
can
trust
in
god
but
those
who
know
his
name
but
this
knowledge
proceeds
not
from
every
man
s
own
imagination
but
from
the
testimony
which
god
himself
gives
of
his
own
goodness
this
the
same
psalmist
confirms
in
another
place
thy
salvation
according
to
thy
again
save
me
i
hoped
in
thy
where
we
must
observe
the
relation
of
faith
to
the
word
and
that
salvation
is
the
consequence
of
it
yet
we
exclude
not
the
divine
power
by
a
view
of
which
unless
faith
be
supported
it
will
never
ascribe
to
god
the
honour
that
is
due
to
him
paul
seems
to
relate
a
trifling
or
uninteresting
circumstance
concerning
abraham
when
he
says
that
he
was
persuaded
that
god
who
had
promised
him
the
blessed
seed
was
able
also
to
in
another
place
respecting
himself
he
says
i
know
whom
i
have
believed
and
am
persuaded
that
he
is
able
to
keep
that
which
i
have
committed
unto
him
against
that
but
if
any
one
considers
how
many
doubts
respecting
the
power
of
god
frequently
intrude
themselves
he
will
fully
acknowledge
that
they
who
magnify
it
as
it
deserves
have
made
no
small
progress
in
faith
we
shall
all
confess
that
god
is
able
to
do
whatever
he
pleases
but
whilst
the
smallest
temptation
strikes
us
with
consternation
and
terror
it
is
evident
that
we
derogate
from
the
divine
power
to
which
we
prefer
the
menaces
of
satan
in
opposition
to
the
promises
of
god
this
is
the
reason
why
isaiah
when
he
would
impress
the
hearts
of
the
people
with
an
assurance
of
salvation
discourses
in
so
magnificent
a
manner
concerning
the
infinite
power
of
god
he
frequently
appears
after
having
begun
to
treat
of
the
hope
of
pardon
and
reconciliation
to
digress
to
another
subject
and
to
wander
through
prolix
and
unnecessary
circumlocutions
celebrating
the
wonders
of
the
divine
government
in
the
machine
of
heaven
and
earth
and
the
whole
order
of
nature
yet
there
is
nothing
but
what
is
applicable
to
the
present
subject
for
unless
the
omnipotence
of
god
be
presented
to
our
eyes
our
ears
will
not
attend
to
his
word
or
not
esteem
it
according
to
its
worth
moreover
the
scripture
there
speaks
of
his
effectual
power
for
piety
as
we
have
elsewhere
seen
always
makes
a
useful
and
practical
application
of
the
power
of
god
and
particularly
proposes
to
itself
those
of
his
works
in
which
he
has
discovered
himself
as
a
father
hence
the
frequent
mention
of
redemption
in
the
scriptures
from
which
the
israelites
might
learn
that
god
who
had
once
been
the
author
of
salvation
would
be
its
everlasting
preserver
david
also
teaches
us
by
his
own
example
that
the
private
benefits
which
god
has
conferred
on
an
individual
conduce
to
the
confirmation
of
his
faith
for
the
future
even
when
he
seems
to
have
deserted
us
we
ought
to
extend
our
views
further
so
as
to
derive
encouragement
from
his
ancient
benefits
as
it
is
said
in
another
psalm
i
remember
the
days
of
old
i
meditate
on
all
thy
works
again
i
will
remember
the
works
of
the
lord
surely
i
will
remember
thy
wonders
of
but
since
without
the
word
all
our
conceptions
of
the
power
and
works
of
god
are
unprofitable
and
transient
we
have
sufficient
reason
for
asserting
that
there
can
be
no
faith
without
the
illumination
of
divine
grace
but
here
a
question
might
be
must
be
thought
of
sarah
and
rebecca
both
of
whom
apparently
impelled
by
the
zeal
of
faith
transgressed
the
limits
of
the
word
sarah
when
she
ardently
desired
the
promised
son
gave
her
to
her
husband
that
she
sinned
in
many
respects
is
not
to
be
denied
but
i
now
refer
to
her
error
in
being
carried
away
by
her
zeal
and
not
restraining
herself
within
the
bounds
of
the
divine
word
yet
it
is
certain
that
this
desire
proceeded
from
faith
rebecca
having
been
divinely
assured
of
the
election
of
her
son
jacob
procures
him
the
benediction
by
a
sinful
artifice
she
deceives
her
husband
the
witness
and
minister
of
the
grace
of
god
she
constrains
her
son
to
utter
falsehoods
she
corrupts
the
truth
of
god
by
various
frauds
and
impostures
finally
by
exposing
his
promise
to
ridicule
she
does
all
in
her
power
to
destroy
it
and
yet
this
transaction
however
criminal
and
reprehensible
was
not
unaccompanied
with
faith
because
she
had
to
overcome
many
obstacles
that
she
might
aspire
earnestly
to
that
which
without
any
expectation
of
worldly
advantage
was
pregnant
with
great
troubles
and
dangers
so
we
must
not
pronounce
the
holy
patriarch
isaac
to
be
entirely
destitute
of
faith
because
after
having
been
divinely
apprized
of
the
translation
of
the
honour
to
his
younger
son
he
nevertheless
ceases
not
to
be
partial
to
esau
his
these
examples
certainly
teach
that
errors
are
frequently
mixed
with
faith
yet
that
faith
when
real
always
retains
the
preëminence
for
as
the
particular
error
of
rebecca
did
not
annul
the
effect
of
the
benediction
so
neither
did
it
destroy
the
faith
which
generally
predominated
in
her
mind
and
was
the
principle
and
cause
of
that
action
nevertheless
rebecca
in
this
instance
has
discovered
how
liable
the
human
mind
is
to
error
as
soon
as
it
allows
itself
the
smallest
license
but
though
our
deficiency
or
imbecility
obscures
faith
yet
it
does
not
extinguish
it
in
the
mean
time
it
reminds
us
how
solicitously
we
ought
to
attend
to
the
declarations
of
god
and
confirms
what
we
have
said
that
faith
decays
unless
it
be
supported
by
the
word
as
the
minds
of
sarah
isaac
and
rebecca
would
have
been
lost
in
their
obliquities
if
they
had
not
by
the
secret
restraint
of
god
been
kept
in
obedience
to
the
word
xxxii
again
it
is
not
without
reason
that
we
include
all
the
promises
in
christ
as
the
apostle
in
the
knowledge
of
him
includes
the
whole
gospel
and
in
another
place
teaches
that
all
the
promises
of
god
in
him
are
yea
and
in
him
the
reason
of
this
is
plain
for
if
god
promises
any
thing
he
gives
a
proof
of
his
benevolence
so
that
there
is
no
promise
of
his
which
is
not
a
testimony
of
his
love
nor
does
it
affect
the
argument
that
the
impious
when
they
are
loaded
with
great
and
continual
benefits
from
the
divine
goodness
render
themselves
obnoxious
to
a
heavier
judgment
for
since
they
neither
think
nor
acknowledge
that
they
receive
those
things
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
if
ever
they
acknowledge
it
yet
they
never
reflect
within
themselves
on
his
goodness
can
not
thereby
be
instructed
concerning
his
mercy
any
more
than
the
brutes
who
according
to
the
circumstances
of
their
condition
receive
the
same
effusion
of
his
liberality
but
never
perceive
it
nor
is
it
any
more
repugnant
to
our
argument
that
by
generally
rejecting
the
promises
designed
for
them
they
draw
down
on
themselves
severer
vengeance
for
although
the
efficacy
of
the
promises
is
manifested
only
when
they
have
obtained
credit
with
us
yet
their
force
and
propriety
are
never
extinguished
by
our
unbelief
or
ingratitude
therefore
when
the
lord
by
his
promises
invites
a
man
not
only
to
receive
but
also
to
meditate
on
the
effects
of
his
goodness
he
at
the
same
time
gives
him
a
declaration
of
his
love
whence
we
must
return
to
this
principle
that
every
promise
is
an
attestation
of
the
divine
love
to
us
but
it
is
beyond
all
controversy
that
no
man
is
loved
by
god
but
in
christ
he
is
the
beloved
son
in
whom
the
love
of
the
father
perpetually
rests
and
then
from
him
diffuses
itself
to
us
as
paul
says
that
we
are
accepted
in
the
it
must
therefore
be
communicated
to
us
by
his
mediation
wherefore
the
apostle
in
another
place
calls
him
our
peace
and
elsewhere
represents
him
as
the
bond
by
which
god
is
united
to
us
in
his
paternal
love
it
follows
that
whenever
any
promise
is
presented
to
us
our
eyes
must
be
directed
to
him
and
that
paul
is
correct
in
stating
that
all
the
promises
of
god
are
confirmed
and
accomplished
in
him
this
is
opposed
by
some
examples
for
it
is
not
credible
that
naaman
the
syrian
when
he
inquired
of
the
prophet
respecting
the
right
method
of
worshipping
god
was
instructed
concerning
the
mediator
yet
his
piety
is
commended
cornelius
a
gentile
and
roman
could
scarcely
be
acquainted
with
what
was
not
universally
or
clearly
known
among
the
jews
yet
his
benefactions
and
prayers
were
acceptable
to
god
and
the
sacrifices
of
naaman
received
the
approbation
of
the
prophet
which
neither
of
these
persons
could
have
obtained
without
faith
similar
was
the
case
of
the
eunuch
to
whom
philip
was
conducted
who
unless
he
had
been
possessed
of
some
faith
would
never
have
incurred
the
labour
and
expense
of
a
long
and
difficult
journey
for
the
sake
of
worshipping
at
jerusalem
yet
we
see
how
on
being
interrogated
by
philip
he
betrayed
his
ignorance
of
the
mediator
i
confess
indeed
that
their
faith
was
in
some
measure
implicit
not
only
with
respect
to
the
person
of
christ
but
with
respect
to
the
power
and
office
assigned
him
by
the
father
at
the
same
time
it
is
certain
that
they
had
imbibed
principles
which
afforded
them
some
notion
of
christ
however
slight
nor
should
this
be
thought
strange
for
the
eunuch
would
not
have
hastened
from
a
remote
country
to
jerusalem
to
adore
an
unknown
god
nor
did
cornelius
spend
so
much
time
after
having
once
embraced
the
jewish
religion
without
acquainting
himself
with
the
rudiments
of
sound
doctrine
with
regard
to
naaman
it
would
have
been
extremely
absurd
for
elisha
who
directed
him
concerning
the
minutest
particulars
to
have
been
silent
on
the
most
important
subject
although
their
knowledge
of
christ
therefore
was
obscure
yet
to
suppose
that
they
had
none
is
unreasonable
because
they
practised
the
sacrifices
of
the
law
which
must
have
been
distinguished
by
their
end
that
is
christ
from
the
illegitimate
sacrifices
of
the
heathen
xxxiii
this
simple
and
external
demonstration
of
the
divine
word
ought
indeed
to
be
fully
sufficient
for
the
production
of
faith
if
it
were
not
obstructed
by
our
blindness
and
perverseness
but
such
is
our
propensity
to
error
that
our
mind
can
never
adhere
to
divine
truth
such
is
our
dulness
that
we
can
never
discern
the
light
of
it
therefore
nothing
is
effected
by
the
word
without
the
illumination
of
the
holy
spirit
whence
it
appears
that
faith
is
far
superior
to
human
intelligence
nor
is
it
enough
for
the
mind
to
be
illuminated
by
the
spirit
of
god
unless
the
heart
also
be
strengthened
and
supported
by
his
power
on
this
point
the
schoolmen
are
altogether
erroneous
who
in
the
discussion
of
faith
regard
it
as
a
simple
assent
of
the
understanding
entirely
neglecting
the
confidence
and
assurance
of
the
heart
faith
therefore
is
a
singular
gift
of
god
in
two
respects
both
as
the
mind
is
enlightened
to
understand
the
truth
of
god
and
as
the
heart
is
established
in
it
for
the
holy
spirit
not
only
originates
faith
but
increases
it
by
degrees
till
he
conducts
us
by
it
all
the
way
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
that
good
thing
says
paul
which
was
committed
unto
thee
keep
by
the
holy
ghost
which
dwelleth
in
if
it
be
urged
that
paul
declares
the
spirit
to
be
given
to
us
by
the
hearing
of
faith
this
objection
is
easily
answered
if
there
were
only
one
gift
of
the
spirit
it
would
be
absurd
to
represent
the
spirit
as
the
effect
of
faith
of
which
he
is
the
author
and
cause
but
when
the
apostle
is
treating
of
the
gifts
with
which
god
adorns
his
church
to
lead
it
by
advancements
in
faith
forwards
to
perfection
we
need
not
wonder
that
he
ascribes
those
gifts
to
faith
which
prepares
us
for
their
reception
it
is
accounted
by
the
world
exceedingly
paradoxical
when
it
is
affirmed
that
no
one
can
believe
in
christ
but
he
to
whom
it
is
given
but
this
is
partly
for
want
of
considering
the
depth
and
sublimity
of
heavenly
wisdom
and
the
extreme
dulness
of
man
in
apprehending
the
mysteries
of
god
and
partly
from
not
regarding
that
firm
and
steadfast
constancy
of
heart
which
is
the
principal
branch
of
faith
xxxiv
but
if
as
paul
tells
us
no
one
is
acquainted
with
the
will
of
a
man
but
the
spirit
of
a
man
which
is
in
him
how
could
man
be
certain
of
the
will
of
god
and
if
we
are
uncertain
respecting
the
truth
of
god
in
those
things
which
are
the
subjects
of
our
present
contemplation
how
should
we
have
a
greater
certainty
of
it
when
the
lord
promises
such
things
as
no
eye
sees
and
no
heart
conceives
human
sagacity
is
here
so
completely
lost
that
the
first
step
to
improvement
in
the
divine
school
is
to
forsake
it
for
like
an
interposing
veil
it
prevents
us
from
discovering
the
mysteries
of
god
which
are
revealed
only
to
babes
for
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
and
the
natural
man
receiveth
not
the
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
for
they
are
foolishness
unto
him
neither
can
he
know
them
because
they
are
spiritually
the
aids
of
the
spirit
therefore
are
necessary
or
rather
it
is
his
influence
alone
that
is
efficacious
here
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor
but
the
spirit
searcheth
all
things
yea
the
deep
things
of
god
and
through
him
we
have
the
mind
of
no
man
can
come
to
me
says
he
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
him
every
man
therefore
that
hath
heard
and
hath
learned
of
the
father
cometh
unto
me
not
that
any
man
hath
seen
the
father
save
he
which
is
of
therefore
as
we
can
never
come
to
christ
unless
we
are
drawn
by
the
spirit
of
god
so
when
we
are
drawn
we
are
raised
both
in
mind
and
in
heart
above
the
reach
of
our
own
understanding
for
illuminated
by
him
the
soul
receives
as
it
were
new
eyes
for
the
contemplation
of
heavenly
mysteries
by
the
splendour
of
which
it
was
before
dazzled
and
thus
the
human
intellect
irradiated
by
the
light
of
the
holy
spirit
then
begins
to
relish
those
things
which
pertain
to
the
kingdom
of
god
for
which
before
it
had
not
the
smallest
taste
wherefore
christ
s
two
disciples
receive
no
benefit
from
his
excellent
discourse
to
them
on
the
mysteries
of
his
kingdom
till
he
opens
their
understanding
that
they
may
understand
the
scriptures
thus
though
the
apostles
were
taught
by
his
divine
mouth
yet
the
spirit
of
truth
must
be
sent
to
them
to
instil
into
their
minds
the
doctrine
which
they
had
heard
with
their
ears
the
word
of
god
is
like
the
sun
shining
on
all
to
whom
it
is
preached
but
without
any
benefit
to
the
blind
but
in
this
respect
we
are
all
blind
by
nature
therefore
it
can
not
penetrate
into
our
minds
unless
the
internal
teacher
the
spirit
make
way
for
it
by
his
illumination
xxxv
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
relating
to
the
corruption
of
nature
we
have
shown
more
at
large
the
inability
of
men
to
believe
therefore
i
shall
not
fatigue
the
reader
by
a
repetition
of
the
same
things
let
it
suffice
that
faith
itself
which
we
possess
not
by
nature
but
which
is
given
us
by
the
spirit
is
called
by
paul
the
spirit
of
therefore
he
prays
that
god
would
fulfil
in
the
thessalonians
all
the
good
pleasure
of
his
goodness
and
the
work
of
faith
with
by
calling
faith
the
work
of
god
and
the
good
pleasure
of
his
goodness
he
denies
it
to
be
the
proper
effect
of
human
exertion
and
not
content
with
that
he
adds
that
it
is
a
specimen
of
the
divine
power
when
he
says
to
the
corinthians
that
faith
stands
not
in
the
wisdom
of
men
but
in
the
power
of
god
he
speaks
indeed
of
external
miracles
but
because
the
reprobate
have
no
eyes
to
behold
them
he
comprehends
also
the
inward
seal
which
he
elsewhere
mentions
and
that
he
may
more
illustriously
display
his
liberality
in
so
eminent
a
gift
god
deigns
not
to
bestow
it
promiscuously
on
all
but
by
a
singular
privilege
imparts
it
to
whom
he
will
we
have
already
cited
testimonies
to
prove
this
point
augustine
who
is
a
faithful
expositor
of
them
says
it
was
in
order
to
teach
us
that
the
act
of
believing
is
owing
to
the
divine
gift
not
to
human
merit
that
our
saviour
declared
no
man
can
come
to
me
except
the
father
which
hath
sent
me
draw
him
and
except
it
were
given
unto
him
of
my
it
is
wonderful
that
two
persons
hear
one
despises
the
other
ascends
let
him
who
despises
impute
it
to
himself
let
him
who
ascends
not
arrogate
it
to
in
another
place
he
says
wherefore
is
it
given
to
one
not
to
another
i
am
not
ashamed
to
reply
this
is
a
depth
of
the
cross
from
i
know
not
what
depth
of
the
divine
judgments
which
we
can
not
scrutinize
proceeds
all
our
ability
that
i
can
i
see
whence
i
can
i
see
not
unless
that
i
see
thus
far
that
it
is
of
god
but
why
one
and
not
another
it
is
too
much
for
me
it
is
an
abyss
a
depth
of
the
cross
i
can
exclaim
with
admiration
but
not
demonstrate
it
in
the
sum
of
the
whole
is
christ
when
he
illuminates
us
with
faith
by
the
power
of
his
spirit
at
the
same
time
ingrafts
us
into
his
body
that
we
may
become
partakers
of
all
his
benefits
xxxvi
it
next
remains
that
what
the
mind
has
imbibed
be
transfused
into
the
heart
for
the
word
of
god
is
not
received
by
faith
if
it
floats
on
the
surface
of
the
brain
but
when
it
has
taken
deep
root
in
the
heart
so
as
to
become
an
impregnable
fortress
to
sustain
and
repel
all
the
assaults
of
temptation
but
if
it
be
true
that
the
right
apprehension
of
the
mind
proceeds
from
the
illumination
of
the
spirit
his
energy
is
far
more
conspicuous
in
such
a
confirmation
of
the
heart
the
diffidence
of
the
heart
being
greater
than
the
blindness
of
the
mind
and
the
furnishing
of
the
heart
with
assurance
being
more
difficult
than
the
communication
of
knowledge
to
the
understanding
therefore
the
spirit
acts
as
a
seal
to
seal
on
our
hearts
those
very
promises
the
certainty
of
which
he
has
previously
impressed
on
our
minds
and
serves
as
an
earnest
to
confirm
and
establish
them
after
that
ye
believed
says
the
apostle
ye
were
sealed
with
that
holy
spirit
of
promise
which
is
the
earnest
of
our
do
you
see
how
he
shows
that
the
hearts
of
believers
are
impressed
by
the
spirit
as
by
a
seal
how
for
this
reason
he
calls
him
the
spirit
of
promise
because
he
ratifies
the
gospel
to
us
so
to
the
corinthians
he
says
he
which
hath
anointed
us
is
god
who
hath
also
sealed
us
and
given
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
in
our
and
in
another
place
where
he
speaks
of
the
confidence
and
boldness
of
hope
he
makes
the
earnest
of
the
spirit
the
foundation
of
it
xxxvii
i
have
not
forgotten
what
i
have
already
observed
and
the
remembrance
of
which
experience
incessantly
renews
that
faith
is
agitated
with
various
doubts
so
that
the
minds
of
the
pious
are
seldom
at
ease
or
at
best
enjoy
not
a
state
of
perpetual
tranquillity
but
whatever
assaults
they
may
sustain
they
either
emerge
from
the
very
gulf
of
temptation
or
remain
firm
in
their
station
this
assurance
alone
nourishes
and
supports
faith
while
we
are
satisfied
of
what
is
declared
by
the
psalmist
god
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
therefore
will
we
not
fear
though
the
earth
be
removed
and
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
this
most
delightful
repose
is
celebrated
also
in
another
psalm
i
laid
me
down
and
slept
i
awaked
for
the
lord
sustained
not
that
david
enjoyed
a
happy
cheerfulness
of
soul
perpetually
flowing
on
in
one
even
tenor
but
having
tasted
the
grace
of
god
according
to
the
proportion
of
his
faith
he
glories
in
intrepidly
despising
whatever
could
disquiet
the
peace
of
his
mind
therefore
the
scripture
intending
to
exhort
us
to
faith
commands
us
to
be
in
isaiah
in
quietness
and
in
confidence
shall
be
your
in
the
psalms
rest
in
the
lord
and
wait
patiently
for
with
which
corresponds
the
observation
of
the
apostle
to
the
hebrews
ye
have
need
of
xxxviii
hence
we
may
judge
how
pernicious
that
dogma
of
the
schoolmen
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
decide
concerning
the
favour
of
god
towards
us
any
otherwise
than
from
moral
conjecture
as
every
individual
may
deem
himself
not
unworthy
of
it
if
it
must
be
determined
by
our
works
how
the
lord
is
affected
towards
us
i
admit
we
can
not
attain
this
object
even
by
a
very
slight
conjecture
but
as
faith
ought
to
correspond
to
the
simple
and
gratuitous
promise
there
remains
no
room
for
doubting
for
with
what
confidence
pray
shall
we
be
armed
if
we
reason
that
god
is
propitious
to
us
on
this
condition
provided
the
purity
of
our
life
deserve
it
but
having
determined
on
a
separate
discussion
of
these
points
i
shall
pursue
them
no
further
at
present
especially
since
it
is
manifest
that
nothing
is
more
opposite
to
faith
than
either
conjecture
or
any
thing
else
approaching
to
doubt
and
they
very
mischievously
pervert
to
this
purpose
the
observation
of
the
preacher
which
is
frequently
in
their
mouths
no
man
knoweth
whether
he
is
worthy
of
hatred
or
of
for
not
to
observe
that
this
passage
is
falsely
rendered
in
the
vulgate
translation
yet
the
meaning
of
solomon
in
such
expressions
must
be
clear
even
to
children
it
is
that
if
any
one
wishes
from
the
present
state
of
things
to
judge
who
are
the
objects
of
divine
love
or
hatred
he
labours
in
vain
and
distresses
himself
to
no
good
purpose
since
there
is
one
event
to
the
righteous
and
to
the
wicked
to
him
that
sacrificeth
and
to
him
that
sacrificeth
whence
it
follows
that
god
neither
testifies
his
love
to
those
whom
he
prospers
with
success
nor
invariably
discovers
his
hatred
against
those
whom
he
plunges
into
affliction
and
this
observation
is
designed
to
reprove
the
vanity
of
the
human
understanding
since
it
is
so
extremely
stupid
respecting
things
most
necessary
to
be
known
he
had
just
before
said
that
which
befalleth
the
sons
of
men
befalleth
beasts
as
the
one
dieth
so
dieth
the
other
yea
they
have
all
one
breath
so
that
a
man
hath
no
preëminence
above
a
if
any
one
would
infer
from
this
that
the
opinion
which
we
hold
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
rests
upon
mere
conjecture
would
he
not
be
deservedly
deemed
insane
are
those
persons
then
in
a
state
of
sanity
who
conclude
that
there
is
no
certainty
of
the
favour
of
god
because
it
can
not
be
attained
from
the
carnal
contemplation
of
present
things
xxxix
but
they
plead
that
it
is
rash
presumption
in
men
to
arrogate
to
themselves
an
undoubted
knowledge
of
the
divine
will
this
indeed
i
would
concede
to
them
if
we
pretended
to
subject
the
incomprehensible
counsel
of
god
to
the
slenderness
of
our
understanding
but
when
we
simply
assert
with
paul
that
we
have
received
not
the
spirit
of
the
world
but
the
spirit
which
is
of
god
that
we
might
know
the
things
that
are
freely
given
to
us
of
god
what
opposition
can
they
make
to
us
without
at
the
same
time
insulting
the
spirit
of
god
but
if
it
be
a
horrible
sacrilege
to
accuse
the
revelation
which
proceeds
from
him
either
of
falsehood
or
of
uncertainty
or
of
ambiguity
wherein
do
we
err
in
affirming
its
certainty
but
they
exclaim
that
we
betray
great
temerity
in
thus
presuming
to
boast
of
the
spirit
of
christ
who
could
believe
the
stupidity
of
men
desirous
of
being
esteemed
teachers
of
the
world
to
be
so
extreme
as
to
stumble
in
this
shameful
manner
at
the
first
elements
of
religion
it
would
certainly
be
incredible
to
me
if
it
were
not
proved
by
the
writings
which
they
have
published
paul
pronounces
them
alone
to
be
the
sons
of
god
who
are
led
by
his
spirit
these
men
will
have
those
who
are
the
sons
of
god
to
be
led
by
their
own
spirit
but
to
be
destitute
of
the
spirit
of
god
he
teaches
that
we
call
god
our
father
at
the
suggestion
of
the
spirit
who
beareth
witness
with
our
spirit
that
we
are
the
children
of
god
these
men
though
they
forbid
not
all
invocation
of
god
yet
deprive
us
of
the
spirit
by
whose
influence
alone
he
can
be
rightly
invoked
he
denies
them
to
be
the
servants
of
christ
who
are
not
led
by
the
spirit
of
christ
these
men
invent
a
sort
of
christianity
to
which
the
spirit
of
christ
is
not
necessary
he
admits
no
hope
of
a
happy
resurrection
unless
we
experience
the
spirit
dwelling
in
us
these
men
fabricate
a
hope
unattended
by
such
experience
but
perhaps
they
will
answer
that
they
deny
not
the
necessity
of
our
being
endued
with
the
spirit
but
that
it
is
the
part
of
modesty
and
humility
not
to
acknowledge
our
possession
of
him
what
then
is
the
meaning
of
the
apostle
in
this
exhortation
to
the
examine
yourselves
whether
ye
be
in
the
faith
prove
your
own
selves
know
ye
not
yourselves
how
that
jesus
christ
is
in
you
except
ye
be
reprobates
but
says
john
we
know
that
he
abideth
in
us
by
the
spirit
which
he
hath
given
and
do
we
not
call
in
question
the
promises
of
christ
when
we
wish
to
be
accounted
the
servants
of
god
without
the
possession
of
his
spirit
whom
he
has
announced
that
he
will
pour
out
upon
all
his
people
do
we
not
injure
the
holy
spirit
if
we
separate
faith
from
him
which
is
his
peculiar
work
these
being
the
first
rudiments
of
piety
it
is
a
proof
of
most
miserable
blindness
that
christians
are
censured
as
arrogant
for
presuming
to
glory
in
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
without
which
glorying
christianity
itself
can
not
exist
but
they
exemplify
the
truth
of
christ
s
assertion
the
world
knoweth
not
the
spirit
of
truth
but
ye
know
him
for
he
dwelleth
with
you
and
shall
be
in
xl
not
satisfied
with
one
attempt
to
destroy
the
stability
of
faith
they
assail
it
again
from
another
quarter
by
arguing
that
although
we
may
form
a
judgment
concerning
the
favour
of
god
from
the
present
state
of
our
righteousness
yet
the
knowledge
of
final
perseverance
remains
in
suspense
truly
we
are
left
in
possession
of
an
admirable
confidence
of
salvation
if
we
can
only
conclude
from
mere
conjecture
that
we
are
in
the
favour
of
god
at
the
present
instant
but
are
utterly
ignorant
what
may
be
our
fate
the
apostle
expresses
a
very
different
opinion
i
am
persuaded
says
he
that
neither
life
nor
death
nor
angels
nor
principalities
nor
powers
nor
things
present
nor
things
to
come
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other
creature
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
they
attempt
to
evade
the
force
of
this
by
a
frivolous
pretence
that
the
apostle
had
it
from
a
particular
revelation
but
they
are
too
closely
pressed
to
avail
themselves
of
this
evasion
for
he
is
there
treating
of
the
benefits
resulting
from
faith
to
all
believers
in
common
not
of
any
which
were
peculiar
to
his
own
experience
but
the
same
apostle
they
say
in
another
place
excites
fear
in
us
by
the
mention
of
our
imbecility
and
inconstancy
let
him
says
he
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
it
is
true
but
not
a
fear
by
which
we
may
be
thrown
into
consternation
but
from
which
we
may
learn
to
humble
ourselves
as
peter
expresses
it
under
the
mighty
hand
of
besides
how
preposterous
is
it
to
limit
to
a
moment
of
time
the
assurance
of
faith
whose
nature
it
is
to
go
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
present
life
and
reach
forward
to
a
future
immortality
since
believers
then
ascribe
it
to
the
grace
of
god
that
they
are
illuminated
by
his
spirit
and
enjoy
through
faith
a
contemplation
of
the
heavenly
life
such
a
glorying
is
so
remote
from
arrogance
that
if
any
one
be
ashamed
to
confess
it
he
rather
betrays
extreme
ingratitude
by
a
criminal
suppression
of
the
divine
goodness
than
gives
an
evidence
of
modesty
or
humility
xli
because
we
thought
that
the
nature
of
faith
could
not
be
better
or
more
clearly
expressed
than
by
the
substance
of
the
promise
which
is
the
proper
foundation
on
which
it
rests
and
the
removal
of
which
would
occasion
its
fall
or
annihilation
is
from
the
promise
therefore
that
we
have
taken
our
definition
which
nevertheless
is
not
at
all
at
variance
with
that
definition
or
rather
description
of
the
apostle
which
he
accommodates
to
his
argument
where
he
says
that
faith
is
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not
for
by
ὑποστασις
which
is
the
word
he
uses
and
which
is
rendered
substance
he
intends
a
prop
as
it
were
on
which
the
pious
mind
rests
and
reclines
as
though
he
had
said
that
faith
is
a
certain
and
secure
possession
of
those
things
which
are
promised
to
us
by
god
unless
any
one
would
rather
understand
ὑποστασις
of
confidence
to
which
i
shall
not
object
though
i
adopt
that
idea
which
is
the
more
generally
received
again
to
signify
that
even
till
the
last
day
when
the
books
shall
be
opened
these
objects
are
too
sublime
to
be
perceived
by
our
senses
seen
with
our
eyes
or
handled
with
our
hands
and
that
in
the
mean
time
they
are
enjoyed
by
us
only
as
we
exceed
the
capacity
of
our
own
understanding
extend
our
views
beyond
all
terrestrial
things
and
even
rise
above
ourselves
he
has
added
that
this
security
of
possession
relates
to
things
which
are
the
objects
of
hope
and
therefore
invisible
for
hope
that
is
seen
as
paul
observes
is
not
hope
for
what
a
man
seeth
why
doth
he
yet
hope
for
but
when
he
calls
it
an
evidence
or
proof
or
as
augustine
has
frequently
rendered
it
a
conviction
of
things
not
seen
for
the
greek
word
is
ἐλεγχος
it
is
just
as
though
he
had
called
it
the
evidence
of
things
not
apparent
the
vision
of
things
not
seen
the
perspicuity
of
things
obscure
the
presence
of
things
absent
the
demonstration
of
things
concealed
for
the
mysteries
of
god
of
which
description
are
the
things
that
pertain
to
our
salvation
can
not
be
discerned
in
themselves
and
in
their
own
nature
we
only
discover
them
in
his
word
of
whose
veracity
we
ought
to
be
so
firmly
persuaded
as
to
consider
all
that
he
speaks
as
though
it
were
already
performed
and
accomplished
but
how
can
the
mind
elevate
itself
to
receive
such
a
taste
of
the
divine
goodness
without
being
all
inflamed
with
mutual
love
to
god
for
the
plenitude
of
happiness
which
god
has
reserved
for
them
who
fear
him
can
not
be
truly
known
but
it
must
at
the
same
time
excite
a
vehement
affection
and
those
whom
it
has
once
affected
it
draws
and
elevates
towards
itself
therefore
we
need
not
wonder
if
a
perverse
and
malicious
heart
never
feel
this
affection
which
conducts
us
to
heaven
itself
and
introduces
us
to
the
most
secret
treasures
of
god
and
the
most
sacred
recesses
of
his
kingdom
which
must
not
be
profaned
by
the
entrance
of
an
impure
heart
for
what
the
schoolmen
advance
concerning
the
priority
of
charity
to
faith
and
hope
is
a
mere
reverie
of
a
distempered
imagination
since
it
is
faith
alone
which
first
produces
charity
in
us
how
much
more
accurately
bernard
speaks
i
believe
says
he
that
the
testimony
of
conscience
which
paul
calls
the
rejoicing
of
the
pious
consists
in
three
things
for
it
is
necessary
to
believe
first
of
all
that
you
can
not
have
remission
of
sins
but
through
the
mercy
of
god
secondly
that
you
can
not
have
any
good
work
unless
he
bestow
this
also
lastly
that
you
can
not
by
any
works
merit
eternal
life
unless
that
also
be
freely
just
after
he
adds
that
these
things
are
not
sufficient
but
are
a
beginning
of
faith
because
in
believing
that
sins
can
only
be
forgiven
by
god
we
ought
at
the
same
time
to
consider
that
they
are
forgiven
us
till
we
are
also
persuaded
by
the
testimony
of
the
holy
spirit
that
salvation
is
laid
up
for
us
because
god
forgives
sins
he
also
bestows
merits
he
likewise
confers
rewards
it
is
not
possible
to
remain
in
this
but
these
and
other
things
must
be
treated
in
the
proper
places
it
may
suffice
at
present
to
ascertain
wherein
faith
itself
consists
xlii
now
wherever
this
living
faith
shall
be
found
it
must
necessarily
be
attended
with
the
hope
of
eternal
salvation
as
its
inseparable
concomitant
or
rather
must
originate
and
produce
it
since
the
want
of
this
hope
would
prove
us
to
be
utterly
destitute
of
faith
however
eloquently
and
beautifully
we
might
discourse
concerning
it
for
if
faith
be
as
has
been
stated
a
certain
persuasion
of
the
truth
of
god
that
it
can
neither
lie
nor
deceive
us
nor
be
frustrated
who
have
felt
this
assurance
likewise
expect
a
period
to
arrive
when
god
will
accomplish
his
promises
which
according
to
their
persuasion
can
not
but
be
true
so
that
in
short
hope
is
no
other
than
an
expectation
of
those
things
which
faith
has
believed
to
be
truly
promised
by
god
thus
faith
believes
the
veracity
of
god
hope
expects
the
manifestation
of
it
in
due
time
faith
believes
him
to
be
our
father
hope
expects
him
always
to
act
towards
us
in
this
character
faith
believes
that
eternal
life
is
given
to
us
hope
expects
it
one
day
to
be
revealed
faith
is
the
foundation
on
which
hope
rests
hope
nourishes
and
sustains
faith
for
as
no
man
can
have
any
expectations
from
god
but
he
who
has
first
believed
his
promises
so
also
the
imbecility
of
our
faith
must
be
sustained
and
cherished
by
patient
hope
and
expectation
lest
it
grow
weary
and
faint
for
which
reason
paul
rightly
places
our
salvation
in
hope
for
hope
while
it
is
silently
expecting
the
lord
restrains
faith
that
it
may
not
be
too
precipitate
it
confirms
faith
that
it
may
not
waver
in
the
divine
promises
or
begin
to
doubt
of
the
truth
of
them
it
refreshes
it
that
it
may
not
grow
weary
it
extends
it
to
the
farthest
goal
that
it
may
not
fail
in
the
midst
of
the
course
or
even
at
the
entrance
of
it
finally
hope
by
continually
renewing
and
restoring
faith
causes
it
frequently
to
persevere
with
more
vigour
than
hope
itself
but
in
how
many
cases
the
assistance
of
hope
is
necessary
to
the
establishment
of
faith
will
better
appear
if
we
consider
how
many
species
of
temptations
assail
and
harass
those
who
have
embraced
the
word
of
god
first
the
lord
by
deferring
the
execution
of
his
promises
frequently
keeps
our
minds
in
suspense
longer
than
we
wish
here
it
is
the
office
of
hope
to
obey
the
injunction
of
the
though
it
tarry
wait
for
sometimes
he
not
only
suffers
us
to
languish
but
openly
manifests
his
indignation
in
this
case
it
is
much
more
necessary
to
have
the
assistance
of
hope
that
according
to
the
language
of
another
prophet
we
may
wait
upon
the
lord
that
hideth
his
face
from
scoffers
also
arise
as
peter
says
and
inquire
where
is
the
promise
of
his
coming
for
since
the
fathers
fell
asleep
all
things
continue
as
they
were
from
the
beginning
of
the
and
the
flesh
and
the
world
whisper
the
same
things
into
our
ears
here
faith
must
be
supported
by
the
patience
of
hope
and
kept
fixed
on
the
contemplation
of
eternity
that
it
may
consider
a
thousand
years
as
one
xliii
on
account
of
this
union
and
affinity
the
scripture
sometimes
uses
the
words
faith
and
hope
without
any
distinction
for
when
peter
says
that
we
are
kept
by
the
power
of
god
through
faith
unto
salvation
ready
to
be
revealed
he
attributes
to
faith
what
was
more
applicable
to
hope
and
not
without
reason
since
we
have
already
shown
that
hope
is
no
other
than
the
nourishment
and
strength
of
faith
sometimes
they
are
joined
together
as
in
a
passage
of
the
same
that
your
faith
and
hope
might
be
in
but
paul
in
the
epistle
to
the
philippians
deduces
expectation
from
hope
because
in
patient
hope
we
suspend
our
desires
till
the
arrival
of
god
s
appointed
time
all
which
may
be
better
understood
from
the
tenth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
which
i
have
already
cited
in
another
place
paul
though
with
some
impropriety
of
expression
conveys
the
very
same
idea
in
these
words
we
through
the
spirit
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
faith
because
having
embraced
the
testimony
of
the
gospel
concerning
his
gratuitous
love
we
wait
till
god
openly
manifests
what
is
now
concealed
under
hope
now
it
is
easy
to
see
the
absurdity
of
peter
lombard
in
laying
a
twofold
foundation
of
hope
the
grace
of
god
and
the
merit
of
works
hope
can
have
no
other
object
than
faith
and
the
only
object
of
faith
we
have
very
clearly
stated
to
be
the
mercy
of
god
to
which
both
its
eyes
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
ought
to
be
directed
but
it
may
be
proper
to
hear
what
kind
of
a
reason
he
advances
if
says
he
you
venture
to
hope
for
any
thing
without
merits
it
must
not
be
called
hope
but
presumption
who
is
there
that
will
not
justly
detest
such
teachers
who
pronounce
a
confidence
in
the
veracity
of
god
to
be
temerity
and
presumption
for
whereas
it
is
the
will
of
the
lord
that
we
should
expect
every
thing
from
his
goodness
they
assert
that
it
is
presumption
to
depend
and
rely
upon
it
such
a
master
is
worthy
of
such
disciples
as
he
has
found
in
the
schools
of
wranglers
but
as
for
us
since
we
see
that
sinners
are
enjoined
by
the
oracles
of
god
to
entertain
a
hope
of
salvation
let
us
joyfully
presume
so
far
on
his
veracity
as
to
reject
all
confidence
in
our
own
works
to
depend
solely
on
his
mercy
and
venture
to
cherish
a
hope
of
happiness
he
who
said
according
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
you
will
not
deceive
us
chapter
iii
on
repentance
though
we
have
already
shown
in
some
respect
how
faith
possesses
christ
and
how
by
means
of
faith
we
enjoy
his
benefits
yet
the
subject
would
still
be
involved
in
obscurity
unless
we
were
to
add
a
description
of
the
effects
which
we
experience
the
substance
of
the
gospel
is
not
without
reason
said
to
be
comprised
in
repentance
and
remission
of
therefore
if
these
two
points
be
omitted
every
controversy
concerning
faith
will
be
jejune
and
incomplete
and
consequently
of
little
use
now
since
both
are
conferred
on
us
by
christ
and
we
obtain
both
by
faith
is
newness
of
life
and
gratuitous
reconciliation
regular
method
of
instruction
requires
me
in
this
place
to
enter
on
the
discussion
of
both
but
our
immediate
transition
will
be
from
faith
to
repentance
because
when
this
point
is
well
understood
it
will
better
appear
how
man
is
justified
by
faith
alone
and
mere
pardon
and
yet
that
real
sanctity
of
life
so
to
speak
is
not
separated
from
the
gratuitous
imputation
of
righteousness
now
it
ought
not
to
be
doubted
that
repentance
not
only
immediately
follows
faith
but
is
produced
by
it
for
since
pardon
or
remission
is
offered
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
in
order
that
the
sinner
liberated
from
the
tyranny
of
satan
from
the
yoke
of
sin
and
the
miserable
servitude
of
his
vices
may
remove
into
the
kingdom
of
god
one
can
embrace
the
grace
of
the
gospel
but
he
must
depart
from
the
errors
of
his
former
life
enter
into
the
right
way
and
devote
all
his
attention
to
the
exercise
of
repentance
those
who
imagine
that
repentance
rather
precedes
faith
than
is
produced
by
it
as
fruit
by
a
tree
have
never
been
acquainted
with
its
power
and
are
induced
to
adopt
that
sentiment
by
a
very
insufficient
argument
ii
they
argue
that
jesus
christ
and
john
the
baptist
in
their
preaching
first
exhort
the
people
to
repentance
and
afterwards
add
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
that
thus
the
apostles
were
commanded
to
preach
and
that
this
according
to
the
account
of
luke
was
the
method
followed
by
paul
but
they
superstitiously
attend
to
the
connection
of
the
syllables
and
disregard
the
sense
and
coherence
of
the
words
for
when
christ
and
john
preach
in
this
manner
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
do
they
not
derive
an
argument
for
repentance
from
grace
itself
and
the
promise
of
salvation
the
meaning
of
their
language
therefore
is
just
as
though
they
had
said
since
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
therefore
repent
for
matthew
having
related
that
john
preached
in
this
manner
informs
us
that
in
him
was
accomplished
the
prediction
of
isaiah
concerning
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
his
paths
but
in
the
prophet
that
voice
is
commanded
to
begin
with
consolation
and
glad
tidings
yet
when
we
speak
of
faith
as
the
origin
of
repentance
we
dream
not
of
any
space
of
time
which
it
employs
in
producing
it
but
we
intend
to
signify
that
a
man
can
not
truly
devote
himself
to
repentance
unless
he
knows
himself
to
be
of
god
now
no
man
is
truly
persuaded
that
he
is
of
god
except
he
has
previously
received
his
grace
but
these
things
will
be
more
clearly
discussed
as
we
proceed
this
circumstance
perhaps
has
deceived
many
are
overcome
or
led
to
obedience
by
terrors
of
conscience
before
they
have
imbibed
a
knowledge
of
grace
or
have
even
tasted
it
and
this
is
the
initial
fear
which
some
number
among
the
graces
because
they
perceive
it
to
be
nearly
connected
with
true
and
righteous
obedience
but
we
are
not
inquiring
at
present
in
how
many
ways
christ
draws
us
to
himself
or
prepares
us
for
the
practice
of
piety
only
i
assert
that
no
rectitude
can
be
found
but
where
that
spirit
reigns
whom
he
has
received
in
order
to
communicate
him
to
his
members
in
the
next
place
according
to
this
passage
in
the
psalms
there
is
forgiveness
with
thee
that
thou
mayest
be
feared
no
man
will
ever
reverence
god
but
he
who
confides
in
his
being
propitious
to
him
no
man
will
cheerfully
devote
himself
to
the
observance
of
his
law
but
he
who
is
persuaded
that
his
services
are
pleasing
to
him
and
this
indulgence
in
pardoning
us
and
bearing
with
our
faults
is
an
evidence
of
his
paternal
favour
the
same
also
appears
from
this
exhortation
of
hosea
come
and
let
us
return
unto
the
lord
for
he
hath
torn
and
he
will
heal
us
he
hath
smitten
and
he
will
bind
us
up
because
the
hope
of
pardon
is
added
as
a
stimulus
to
prevent
them
from
being
stupefied
in
their
sins
but
there
is
not
the
least
appearance
of
reason
in
the
notion
of
those
who
in
order
to
begin
with
repentance
prescribe
to
their
young
converts
certain
days
during
which
they
must
exercise
themselves
in
repentance
after
the
expiration
of
which
they
admit
them
to
the
communion
of
evangelical
grace
i
speak
of
many
of
the
anabaptists
especially
of
those
who
wonderfully
delight
in
being
accounted
spiritual
and
their
companions
the
jesuits
and
other
such
worthless
men
such
are
the
effects
produced
by
that
spirit
of
fanaticism
that
it
terminates
repentance
within
the
limits
of
a
few
short
days
which
a
christian
ought
to
extend
throughout
his
whole
life
iii
but
concerning
repentance
some
learned
men
in
times
very
remote
from
the
present
desiring
to
express
themselves
with
simplicity
and
sincerity
according
to
the
rule
of
the
scripture
have
said
that
it
consists
of
two
and
vivification
mortification
they
explain
to
be
the
sorrow
of
the
mind
and
the
terror
experienced
from
a
knowledge
of
sin
and
a
sense
of
the
divine
judgments
for
when
any
one
has
been
brought
to
a
true
knowledge
of
sin
he
then
begins
truly
to
hate
and
abhor
it
then
he
is
heartily
displeased
with
himself
confesses
himself
to
be
miserable
and
lost
and
wishes
that
he
were
another
man
moreover
when
he
is
affected
with
some
sense
of
the
divine
judgment
for
the
one
immediately
follows
the
other
then
indeed
he
is
stricken
with
consternation
he
trembles
with
humility
and
dejection
he
feels
a
despondency
of
mind
he
falls
into
despair
this
is
the
first
part
of
repentance
which
they
have
generally
styled
contrition
vivification
they
explain
to
be
the
consolation
which
is
produced
by
faith
when
a
man
after
having
been
humbled
with
a
consciousness
of
sin
and
stricken
with
the
fear
of
god
afterwards
contemplates
the
goodness
of
god
and
the
mercy
grace
and
salvation
bestowed
through
christ
rises
from
his
depression
feels
himself
recovers
his
courage
and
as
it
were
returns
from
death
to
life
these
terms
provided
they
be
rightly
understood
are
sufficiently
adapted
to
express
the
nature
of
repentance
but
when
they
explain
vivification
of
that
joy
which
the
mind
experiences
after
its
perturbations
and
fears
are
allayed
i
can
not
coincide
with
them
since
it
should
rather
signify
an
ardent
desire
and
endeavour
to
live
a
holy
and
pious
life
as
though
it
were
said
that
a
man
dies
to
himself
that
he
may
begin
to
live
to
god
iv
others
perceiving
this
word
to
have
various
acceptations
in
scripture
have
laid
down
two
kinds
of
repentance
and
to
distinguish
them
by
some
character
have
called
one
legal
in
which
the
sinner
wounded
by
the
envenomed
dart
of
sin
and
harassed
by
the
fear
of
divine
wrath
is
involved
in
deep
distress
without
the
power
of
extricating
himself
the
other
they
style
evangelical
in
which
the
sinner
is
grievously
afflicted
in
himself
but
rises
above
his
distress
and
embraces
christ
as
the
medicine
for
his
wound
the
consolation
of
his
terrors
and
his
refuge
from
all
misery
of
legal
repentance
they
consider
cain
saul
and
judas
as
examples
the
scriptural
account
of
whose
repentance
gives
us
to
understand
that
from
a
knowledge
of
the
greatness
of
their
sins
they
dreaded
the
divine
wrath
but
that
considering
god
only
as
an
avenger
and
a
judge
they
perished
under
that
apprehension
their
repentance
therefore
was
only
as
it
were
the
antechamber
of
hell
which
having
already
entered
in
this
life
they
began
to
suffer
punishment
from
the
manifestation
of
the
wrath
of
the
divine
majesty
evangelical
repentance
we
discover
in
all
who
have
been
distressed
by
a
sense
of
sin
in
themselves
but
have
been
raised
from
their
depression
and
reinvigorated
by
a
confidence
in
the
divine
mercy
and
converted
to
the
lord
hezekiah
was
terrified
when
he
received
the
message
of
death
but
he
wept
and
prayed
and
contemplating
the
goodness
of
god
recovered
his
former
confidence
the
ninevites
were
confounded
by
the
terrible
denunciation
of
destruction
but
they
covered
themselves
with
sackcloth
and
ashes
and
prayed
in
hope
that
the
lord
might
be
appeased
and
the
fury
of
his
wrath
averted
david
confessed
that
he
had
committed
a
great
sin
in
numbering
the
people
but
added
o
lord
take
away
the
iniquity
of
thy
he
acknowledged
his
crime
of
adultery
at
the
rebuke
of
nathan
and
prostrated
himself
before
the
lord
but
at
the
same
time
cherished
an
expectation
of
pardon
such
was
the
repentance
of
those
who
felt
compunction
of
heart
at
the
preaching
of
peter
but
confiding
in
the
goodness
of
god
exclaimed
men
and
brethren
what
shall
we
do
such
also
was
that
of
peter
himself
who
wept
bitterly
but
never
lost
his
hope
though
all
these
observations
are
true
yet
the
term
repentance
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
from
the
scriptures
must
have
a
different
acceptation
for
to
include
faith
in
repentance
is
repugnant
to
what
paul
says
in
the
he
testified
both
to
the
jews
and
also
to
the
greeks
repentance
toward
god
and
faith
toward
our
lord
jesus
christ
where
he
mentions
faith
and
repentance
as
two
things
totally
distinct
what
then
can
true
repentance
exist
without
faith
not
at
all
but
though
they
can
not
be
separated
yet
they
ought
to
be
distinguished
as
faith
exists
not
without
hope
and
yet
there
is
a
difference
between
them
so
repentance
and
faith
although
they
are
perpetually
and
indissolubly
united
require
to
be
connected
rather
than
confounded
i
am
well
aware
that
under
the
term
is
comprehended
a
complete
conversion
to
god
of
which
faith
is
one
of
the
principal
branches
but
in
what
sense
will
best
appear
from
an
explication
of
its
nature
and
properties
the
hebrew
word
for
repentance
denotes
conversion
or
return
the
greek
word
signifies
change
of
mind
and
intention
repentance
itself
corresponds
very
well
with
both
etymologies
for
it
comprehends
these
two
forsaking
ourselves
we
should
turn
to
god
and
laying
aside
our
old
mind
should
assume
a
new
one
wherefore
i
conceive
it
may
be
justly
defined
to
be
true
conversion
of
our
life
to
god
proceeding
from
a
sincere
and
serious
fear
of
god
and
consisting
in
the
mortification
of
our
flesh
and
of
the
old
man
and
in
the
vivification
of
the
in
this
sense
we
must
understand
all
the
addresses
in
which
either
the
prophets
in
ancient
days
or
the
apostles
in
a
succeeding
age
exhorted
their
contemporaries
to
repentance
for
the
point
to
which
they
endeavoured
to
bring
them
was
being
confounded
by
their
sins
and
penetrated
with
a
fear
of
the
divine
judgment
they
might
prostrate
themselves
in
humility
before
him
against
whom
they
had
offended
and
with
true
penitence
return
into
his
right
way
therefore
these
expressions
and
return
to
the
are
promiscuously
used
by
them
in
the
same
signification
hence
also
the
sacred
history
expresses
repentance
by
and
when
men
who
have
disregarded
him
and
indulged
their
criminal
propensities
begin
to
obey
his
word
and
are
ready
to
follow
whithersoever
he
calls
them
and
john
and
paul
have
spoken
of
bringing
forth
fruits
meet
for
repentance
to
signify
a
life
which
in
every
action
will
discover
and
testify
such
a
repentance
vi
but
before
we
proceed
any
further
it
will
be
useful
to
amplify
and
explain
the
definition
we
have
given
in
which
there
are
three
points
to
be
particularly
considered
in
the
first
place
when
we
call
repentance
a
conversion
of
the
life
to
god
we
require
a
transformation
not
only
in
the
external
actions
but
in
the
soul
itself
which
after
having
put
off
its
old
nature
should
produce
the
fruits
of
actions
corresponding
to
its
renovation
the
prophet
intending
to
express
this
idea
commands
those
whom
he
calls
to
repentance
to
make
themselves
a
new
heart
wherefore
moses
when
about
to
show
how
the
israelites
might
repent
and
be
rightly
converted
to
the
lord
frequently
teaches
them
that
it
must
be
done
with
all
their
heart
and
with
all
their
soul
and
by
speaking
of
the
circumcision
of
the
heart
he
enters
into
the
inmost
affections
of
the
mind
this
mode
of
expression
we
find
often
repeated
by
the
prophets
but
there
is
no
passage
from
which
we
may
obtain
clearer
ideas
of
the
true
nature
of
repentance
than
from
the
language
of
god
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
jeremiah
if
thou
wilt
return
o
israel
saith
the
lord
return
unto
me
break
up
your
fallow
ground
and
sow
not
among
thorns
circumcise
yourselves
to
the
lord
and
take
away
the
foreskins
of
your
observe
how
he
denounces
that
they
shall
labour
in
vain
in
the
pursuit
of
righteousness
unless
impiety
be
previously
eradicated
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
and
in
order
to
make
a
deeper
impression
upon
them
he
apprizes
them
that
they
have
to
do
with
god
with
whom
subterfuges
are
of
no
avail
because
he
abhors
all
duplicity
of
heart
for
this
reason
isaiah
ridicules
the
preposterous
endeavours
of
hypocrites
who
did
indeed
strenuously
attempt
an
external
repentance
by
the
observance
of
ceremonies
but
at
the
same
time
were
not
concerned
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
with
which
they
oppressed
the
poor
in
that
passage
he
also
beautifully
shows
in
what
duties
unfeigned
repentance
properly
consists
vii
in
the
second
place
we
represented
repentance
as
proceeding
from
a
serious
fear
of
god
for
before
the
mind
of
a
sinner
can
be
inclined
to
repentance
it
must
be
excited
by
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
judgment
but
when
this
thought
has
once
been
deeply
impressed
that
god
will
one
day
ascend
his
tribunal
to
exact
an
account
of
all
words
and
actions
it
will
not
permit
the
miserable
man
to
take
any
interval
of
rest
or
to
enjoy
even
a
momentary
respite
but
perpetually
stimulates
him
to
adopt
a
new
course
of
life
that
he
may
be
able
to
appear
with
security
at
that
judgment
wherefore
the
scripture
when
it
exhorts
to
repentance
frequently
introduces
a
mention
of
the
judgment
as
in
jeremiah
lest
my
fury
come
forth
like
fire
and
burn
that
none
can
quench
it
because
of
the
evil
of
your
doings
in
the
address
of
paul
to
the
athenians
the
times
of
this
ignorance
god
winked
at
but
now
commandeth
all
men
every
where
to
repent
because
he
hath
appointed
a
day
in
which
he
will
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
and
in
many
other
places
sometimes
by
the
punishments
already
inflicted
it
declares
that
god
is
a
judge
in
order
that
sinners
may
consider
with
themselves
that
worse
calamities
await
them
unless
they
speedily
repent
we
have
an
example
of
this
in
the
chapter
of
deuteronomy
but
since
conversion
commences
with
a
dread
and
hatred
of
sin
therefore
the
apostle
makes
godly
sorrow
the
cause
of
repentance
he
calls
it
godly
sorrow
when
we
not
only
dread
punishment
but
hate
and
abhor
sin
itself
from
a
knowledge
that
it
is
displeasing
to
god
nor
ought
this
to
be
thought
strange
for
unless
we
felt
sharp
compunction
our
carnal
sluggishness
could
never
be
corrected
and
even
these
distresses
of
mind
would
not
be
sufficient
to
arouse
it
from
its
stupidity
and
indolence
if
god
by
the
infliction
of
his
chastisements
did
not
make
a
deeper
impression
beside
this
there
is
a
rebellious
obstinacy
which
requires
violent
blows
as
it
were
to
overcome
it
the
severity
therefore
which
god
uses
in
his
threatenings
is
extorted
from
him
by
the
depravity
of
our
minds
since
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
address
kind
and
alluring
invitations
to
those
who
are
asleep
i
forbear
to
recite
the
testimonies
with
which
the
scripture
abounds
the
fear
of
god
is
called
the
beginning
of
repentance
also
for
another
reason
because
though
a
man
s
life
were
perfect
in
every
virtue
if
it
be
not
devoted
to
the
worship
of
god
it
may
indeed
be
commended
by
the
world
but
in
heaven
it
will
be
only
an
abomination
since
the
principal
branch
of
righteousness
consists
in
rendering
to
god
the
honour
due
to
him
of
which
he
is
impiously
defrauded
when
it
is
not
our
end
and
aim
to
submit
ourselves
to
his
government
viii
it
remains
for
us
in
the
third
place
to
explain
our
position
that
repentance
consists
of
two
mortification
of
the
flesh
and
the
vivification
of
the
spirit
this
is
clearly
expressed
by
the
prophets
although
in
a
simple
and
homely
manner
according
to
the
capacity
of
a
carnal
people
when
they
say
depart
from
evil
and
do
again
wash
you
make
you
clean
put
away
the
evil
of
your
doings
from
before
mine
eyes
cease
to
do
evil
learn
to
do
well
seek
judgment
relieve
the
oppressed
for
when
they
call
men
from
the
paths
of
wickedness
they
require
the
total
destruction
of
the
flesh
which
is
full
of
wickedness
and
perverseness
it
is
a
thing
truly
difficult
and
arduous
to
put
off
ourselves
and
to
depart
from
the
native
bias
of
our
minds
nor
must
the
flesh
be
considered
as
entirely
dead
unless
all
that
we
have
of
ourselves
be
destroyed
but
since
the
universal
disposition
of
the
flesh
is
settled
enmity
against
god
the
first
step
to
an
obedience
of
the
law
is
this
renunciation
of
our
own
nature
they
afterwards
designate
the
renovation
by
its
judgment
and
mercy
for
a
punctual
performance
of
these
external
duties
would
not
be
sufficient
unless
the
mind
and
heart
had
previously
acquired
a
disposition
of
righteousness
judgment
and
mercy
this
takes
place
when
the
spirit
of
god
has
tinctured
our
souls
with
his
holiness
and
given
them
such
new
thoughts
and
affections
that
they
may
be
justly
considered
as
new
or
altogether
different
from
what
they
were
before
and
certainly
as
we
have
a
natural
aversion
to
god
we
shall
never
aim
at
that
which
is
right
without
a
previous
renunciation
of
ourselves
therefore
we
are
so
frequently
commanded
to
put
off
the
old
man
to
renounce
the
world
and
the
flesh
to
forsake
our
lusts
and
to
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
our
mind
besides
the
very
word
mortification
reminds
us
how
difficult
it
is
to
forget
our
former
nature
for
it
implies
that
we
can
not
be
formed
to
the
fear
of
god
and
learn
the
rudiments
of
piety
without
being
violently
slain
and
annihilated
by
the
sword
of
the
spirit
as
though
god
had
pronounced
that
in
order
to
our
being
numbered
among
his
children
there
is
a
necessity
for
the
destruction
of
our
common
nature
ix
both
these
branches
of
repentance
are
effects
of
our
participation
of
christ
for
if
we
truly
partake
of
his
death
our
old
man
is
crucified
by
its
power
and
the
body
of
sin
expires
so
that
the
corruption
of
our
former
nature
loses
all
its
vigour
if
we
are
partakers
of
his
resurrection
we
are
raised
by
it
to
a
newness
of
life
which
corresponds
with
the
righteousness
of
god
in
one
word
i
apprehend
repentance
to
be
regeneration
the
end
of
which
is
the
restoration
of
the
divine
image
within
us
which
was
defaced
and
almost
obliterated
by
the
transgression
of
adam
thus
the
apostle
teaches
us
when
he
says
but
we
all
with
open
face
beholding
as
in
a
glass
the
glory
of
the
lord
are
changed
into
the
same
image
from
glory
to
glory
even
as
by
the
spirit
of
the
again
be
ye
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
mind
and
put
on
the
new
man
which
after
god
is
created
in
righteousness
and
true
again
in
another
place
and
ye
have
put
on
the
new
man
which
is
renewed
in
knowledge
after
the
image
of
him
that
created
wherefore
in
this
regeneration
we
are
restored
by
the
grace
of
christ
to
the
righteousness
of
god
from
which
we
fell
in
adam
in
which
manner
the
lord
is
pleased
completely
to
restore
all
those
whom
he
adopts
to
the
inheritance
of
life
and
this
restoration
is
not
accomplished
in
a
single
moment
or
day
or
year
but
by
continual
and
sometimes
even
tardy
advances
the
lord
destroys
the
carnal
corruptions
of
his
chosen
purines
them
from
all
pollution
and
consecrates
them
as
temples
to
himself
renewing
all
their
senses
to
real
purity
that
they
may
employ
their
whole
life
in
the
exercise
of
repentance
and
know
that
this
warfare
will
be
terminated
only
by
death
and
so
much
the
greater
is
the
wickedness
of
that
impure
and
quarrelsome
apostate
staphylus
who
idly
pretends
that
i
confound
the
state
of
the
present
life
with
the
glory
of
heaven
when
i
explain
the
image
of
god
according
to
paul
to
be
righteousness
and
true
holiness
as
if
indeed
when
any
thing
is
to
be
defined
we
are
not
to
inquire
after
the
completeness
and
perfection
of
it
it
is
not
denied
that
there
is
room
for
further
advances
but
i
assert
that
as
far
as
any
man
approaches
to
a
resemblance
of
god
so
far
the
image
of
god
is
displayed
in
him
that
believers
may
attain
to
this
god
assigns
them
the
race
of
repentance
to
run
during
their
whole
life
x
thus
therefore
the
children
of
god
are
liberated
by
regeneration
from
the
servitude
of
sin
not
that
they
have
already
obtained
the
full
possession
of
liberty
and
experience
no
more
trouble
from
the
flesh
but
there
remains
in
them
a
perpetual
cause
of
contention
to
exercise
them
and
not
only
to
exercise
them
but
also
to
make
them
better
acquainted
with
their
own
infirmity
and
on
this
subject
all
sound
writers
are
there
still
remains
in
a
regenerate
man
a
fountain
of
evil
continually
producing
irregular
desires
which
allure
and
stimulate
him
to
the
commission
of
sin
they
acknowledge
also
that
saints
are
still
so
afflicted
with
the
disease
of
concupiscence
that
they
can
not
prevent
their
being
frequently
stimulated
and
incited
either
to
lust
or
to
avarice
or
to
ambition
or
to
other
vices
there
is
no
need
of
a
laborious
investigation
to
learn
what
were
the
sentiments
of
the
fathers
on
this
subject
it
will
be
sufficient
to
consult
augustine
alone
who
with
great
diligence
and
fidelity
has
collected
the
opinions
of
them
all
from
him
then
the
reader
may
receive
all
the
certainty
he
can
desire
concerning
the
sense
of
antiquity
between
him
and
us
this
difference
may
be
while
he
concedes
that
believers
as
long
as
they
inhabit
a
mortal
body
are
so
bound
by
concupiscence
that
they
can
not
but
feel
irregular
desires
yet
he
ventures
not
to
call
this
disease
by
the
name
of
but
content
with
designating
it
by
the
appellation
of
infirmity
teaches
that
it
only
becomes
sin
in
cases
where
either
action
or
consent
is
added
to
the
conception
or
apprehension
of
the
mind
that
is
where
the
will
yields
to
the
first
impulse
of
appetite
but
we
on
the
contrary
deem
it
to
be
sin
whenever
a
man
feels
any
evil
desires
contrary
to
the
divine
law
and
we
also
assert
the
depravity
itself
to
be
sin
which
produces
these
desires
in
our
minds
we
maintain
therefore
that
sin
always
exists
in
the
saints
till
they
are
divested
of
the
mortal
body
because
their
flesh
is
the
residence
of
that
depravity
of
concupiscence
which
is
repugnant
to
all
rectitude
nevertheless
he
has
not
always
refrained
from
using
the
word
sin
in
this
sense
as
when
he
says
paul
gives
the
appellation
of
sin
to
this
from
which
all
sins
proceed
that
is
to
carnal
concupiscence
this
as
it
respects
the
saints
loses
its
kingdom
on
earth
and
has
no
existence
in
in
these
words
he
acknowledges
that
believers
are
guilty
of
sin
inasmuch
as
they
are
the
subjects
of
carnal
concupiscence
xi
but
when
god
is
said
to
cleanse
his
church
from
all
sin
to
promise
the
grace
of
deliverance
in
baptism
and
to
fulfil
it
in
his
elect
refer
these
phrases
rather
to
the
guilt
of
sin
than
to
the
existence
of
sin
in
the
regeneration
of
his
children
god
does
indeed
destroy
the
kingdom
of
sin
in
them
for
the
spirit
supplies
them
with
strength
which
renders
them
victorious
in
the
conflict
but
though
it
ceases
to
reign
it
continues
to
dwell
in
them
wherefore
we
say
that
the
old
man
is
crucified
that
the
law
of
sin
is
abolished
in
the
children
of
god
yet
so
that
some
relics
remain
not
to
predominate
over
them
but
to
humble
them
with
a
consciousness
of
their
infirmity
we
grant
indeed
that
they
are
not
imputed
any
more
than
if
they
did
not
exist
but
we
likewise
contend
that
it
is
owing
to
the
mercy
of
god
that
the
saints
are
delivered
from
this
guilt
who
would
otherwise
be
justly
accounted
sinners
and
guilty
before
him
nor
will
it
be
difficult
for
us
to
confirm
this
opinion
since
there
are
clear
testimonies
of
scripture
to
support
it
what
can
we
desire
more
explicit
than
the
declaration
of
paul
to
the
romans
in
the
first
place
that
he
there
speaks
in
the
character
of
a
regenerate
man
we
have
already
shown
and
augustine
has
evinced
the
same
by
the
strongest
arguments
i
say
nothing
of
his
using
the
words
evil
and
sin
however
those
who
wish
to
oppose
us
may
cavil
at
those
words
yet
who
can
deny
that
a
resistance
to
the
divine
law
is
evil
who
can
deny
that
an
opposition
to
righteousness
is
sin
finally
who
will
not
admit
that
there
is
guilt
wherever
there
is
spiritual
misery
but
all
these
things
are
affirmed
by
paul
respecting
this
disease
besides
we
have
a
certain
demonstration
from
the
law
by
which
this
whole
question
may
be
briefly
decided
for
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
with
all
our
heart
with
all
our
mind
and
with
all
our
strength
since
all
the
powers
of
our
soul
ought
to
be
thus
occupied
by
the
love
of
god
it
is
evident
that
the
precept
is
not
fulfilled
by
those
who
receive
into
their
hearts
the
least
desire
or
admit
into
their
minds
any
thought
which
may
draw
them
aside
from
the
love
of
god
into
vanity
what
then
are
not
these
properties
of
the
soul
be
affected
with
sudden
emotions
to
apprehend
in
the
sensory
and
to
form
conceptions
in
the
mind
when
these
therefore
open
a
way
for
the
admission
of
vain
and
corrupt
thoughts
do
they
not
show
that
they
are
so
far
destitute
of
the
love
of
god
whoever
therefore
refuses
to
acknowledge
that
all
the
inordinate
desires
of
the
flesh
are
sins
and
that
that
malady
of
concupiscence
which
they
call
an
incentive
to
sin
is
the
source
of
sin
must
necessarily
deny
the
transgression
of
the
law
to
be
sin
xii
if
it
be
thought
absurd
that
all
the
natural
appetites
of
man
should
be
thus
universally
condemned
since
they
were
implanted
by
god
the
author
of
nature
reply
that
we
by
no
means
condemn
those
desires
which
god
implanted
so
deeply
in
the
nature
of
man
at
his
first
creation
that
they
can
not
be
eradicated
from
it
without
destroying
humanity
itself
but
only
those
insolent
and
lawless
appetites
which
resist
the
commands
of
god
but
now
since
through
the
depravity
of
nature
all
its
powers
are
so
vitiated
and
corrupted
that
disorder
and
intemperance
are
visible
in
all
our
actions
because
the
appetites
are
inseparable
from
such
excesses
therefore
we
maintain
that
they
are
corrupt
or
if
it
be
wished
to
have
the
substance
of
our
opinion
in
fewer
words
we
say
that
all
the
desires
of
men
are
evil
and
we
consider
them
to
be
sinful
not
as
they
are
natural
but
because
they
are
inordinate
and
we
affirm
they
are
inordinate
because
nothing
pure
or
immaculate
can
proceed
from
a
corrupted
and
polluted
nature
nor
does
augustine
deviate
from
this
doctrine
so
much
as
he
appears
to
do
when
he
is
too
much
afraid
of
the
odium
with
which
the
pelagians
endeavoured
to
overwhelm
him
he
sometimes
refrains
from
using
the
word
yet
when
he
says
that
the
law
of
sin
remains
in
the
saints
and
that
only
the
guilt
is
abolished
he
sufficiently
indicates
that
he
is
not
averse
to
our
opinion
xiii
we
will
adduce
some
other
passages
from
which
his
sentiments
will
more
fully
appear
in
his
second
book
against
julian
this
law
of
sin
is
both
abolished
in
the
spiritual
regeneration
and
continues
in
the
mortal
flesh
abolished
since
the
guilt
is
removed
in
the
sacrament
by
which
believers
are
regenerated
but
continues
because
it
produces
those
desires
against
which
also
believers
again
therefore
the
law
of
sin
which
was
in
the
members
even
of
so
great
an
apostle
is
abolished
in
baptism
but
not
finally
again
the
law
of
sin
the
remaining
guilt
of
which
is
removed
in
baptism
ambrose
has
called
because
it
is
iniquitous
for
the
flesh
to
lust
against
the
again
sin
is
dead
in
that
guilt
in
which
it
held
us
and
although
dead
it
will
rebel
till
it
is
cured
by
the
perfection
of
in
the
fifth
book
he
is
still
more
explicit
as
blindness
of
heart
is
both
a
sin
which
consists
in
a
man
s
not
believing
in
god
and
a
punishment
for
sin
by
which
a
proud
heart
is
deservedly
punished
and
also
a
cause
of
sin
when
any
is
committed
through
the
error
of
a
blind
heart
so
the
concupiscence
of
the
flesh
against
which
the
good
spirit
lusteth
is
both
a
sin
because
it
is
a
disobedience
against
the
government
of
the
mind
and
a
punishment
for
sin
because
it
is
inflicted
for
the
demerits
of
the
disobedient
and
also
a
cause
of
sin
consenting
by
defection
or
produced
from
here
he
styles
it
without
any
ambiguity
because
having
overthrown
error
and
confirmed
the
truth
he
is
not
so
much
afraid
of
calumnies
as
also
in
the
homily
on
john
where
he
undoubtedly
speaks
the
real
sentiments
of
his
mind
if
in
the
flesh
you
serve
the
law
of
sin
do
what
the
apostle
himself
let
not
sin
reign
in
your
mortal
body
that
ye
should
obey
it
in
the
lusts
he
says
not
let
it
not
exist
but
let
it
not
reign
as
long
as
you
live
sin
must
necessarily
exist
in
your
members
let
it
at
least
be
divested
of
its
kingdom
so
that
its
commands
may
not
be
those
who
contend
that
concupiscence
is
not
sin
commonly
object
this
passage
of
when
lust
hath
conceived
it
bringeth
forth
but
this
objection
is
easily
repelled
for
unless
we
understand
him
there
to
speak
of
evil
works
exclusively
or
of
actual
sins
even
an
evil
volition
can
not
be
accounted
sin
but
from
his
calling
flagitious
and
criminal
actions
the
offspring
of
lust
and
attributing
to
them
the
name
of
sin
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
concupiscence
is
not
an
evil
thing
and
deserving
of
condemnation
in
the
sight
of
god
xiv
some
anabaptists
in
the
present
age
imagine
i
know
not
what
frantic
intemperance
instead
of
spiritual
the
children
of
god
being
restored
to
a
state
of
innocence
are
no
longer
obliged
to
be
solicitous
to
restrain
the
licentiousness
of
the
flesh
but
that
they
ought
to
follow
the
leadings
of
the
spirit
under
whose
direction
it
is
impossible
ever
to
err
it
would
be
incredible
that
the
mind
of
man
should
fall
into
such
madness
did
they
not
publicly
and
haughtily
disseminate
this
opinion
it
is
indeed
truly
prodigious
but
it
is
just
and
reasonable
that
those
who
have
persuaded
themselves
to
pervert
the
truth
of
god
into
a
falsehood
should
suffer
such
punishment
for
their
sacrilegious
presumption
must
all
distinction
then
of
honour
and
turpitude
justice
and
injustice
good
and
evil
virtue
and
vice
be
annihilated
this
difference
they
say
proceeds
from
the
malediction
of
the
old
adam
from
which
we
are
delivered
by
christ
then
there
will
be
no
difference
now
between
chastity
and
fornication
sincerity
and
knavery
truth
and
falsehood
equity
and
rapine
dismiss
they
say
all
vain
fear
the
spirit
will
command
you
nothing
that
is
evil
provided
you
securely
and
intrepidly
resign
yourself
to
his
direction
who
is
not
astonished
at
these
monstrous
notions
yet
this
is
a
popular
philosophy
among
those
who
blinded
by
the
violence
of
their
appetites
have
discarded
common
sense
but
what
kind
of
a
christ
and
what
kind
of
a
spirit
have
they
fabricated
for
us
for
we
acknowledge
one
christ
and
his
spirit
alone
whom
the
prophets
have
celebrated
whom
the
gospel
proclaims
as
revealed
but
of
whom
it
gives
us
no
such
account
as
this
that
spirit
is
not
the
patron
of
murder
fornication
drunkenness
pride
contention
avarice
or
fraud
but
the
author
of
love
chastity
sobriety
modesty
peace
moderation
and
truth
he
is
not
a
spirit
of
fanaticism
rushing
precipitately
without
any
consideration
through
right
and
wrong
but
is
full
of
wisdom
and
understanding
rightly
to
discern
between
justice
and
injustice
he
never
instigates
to
dissolute
and
unrestrained
licentiousness
but
discriminating
between
what
is
lawful
and
what
is
unlawful
inculcates
temperance
and
moderation
but
why
should
we
spend
any
more
labour
in
refuting
this
monstrous
frenzy
to
christians
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
not
a
turbulent
phantom
which
they
have
either
spawned
themselves
in
a
dream
or
received
from
the
invention
of
others
but
they
religiously
seek
the
knowledge
of
him
in
the
scriptures
where
these
two
things
are
delivered
concerning
that
he
is
given
to
us
in
order
to
our
sanctification
to
purify
us
from
all
our
pollutions
and
lead
us
to
obey
the
divine
righteousness
which
obedience
can
not
exist
without
the
subjugation
of
the
appetites
to
which
these
men
would
allow
an
unlimited
license
in
the
next
place
that
we
are
so
purified
by
his
sanctification
that
we
are
nevertheless
still
encompassed
with
numerous
vices
and
great
infirmity
as
long
as
we
are
burdened
with
the
body
wherefore
being
at
a
great
distance
from
perfection
it
behoves
us
to
make
continual
advances
and
being
entangled
in
vices
we
have
need
to
strive
against
them
every
day
hence
also
it
follows
that
we
ought
to
shake
off
all
slothful
security
and
exert
the
most
vigilant
attention
lest
without
caution
we
should
be
surprised
and
overcome
by
the
snares
of
our
flesh
unless
we
are
well
assured
that
we
have
made
a
greater
progress
than
the
apostle
who
nevertheless
was
buffeted
by
the
messenger
of
satan
that
his
strength
might
be
made
perfect
in
weakness
and
who
faithfully
represented
the
conflict
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
which
he
experienced
in
his
own
person
xv
when
the
apostle
in
a
description
of
repentance
enumerates
seven
things
which
are
either
causes
producing
it
or
effects
proceeding
from
it
or
members
and
parts
of
it
he
does
it
for
a
very
good
reason
these
things
are
carefulness
excuse
indignation
fear
vehement
desire
zeal
revenge
nor
ought
it
to
be
thought
strange
that
i
venture
not
to
determine
whether
they
should
be
considered
as
causes
or
effects
for
arguments
may
be
adduced
in
support
of
both
they
may
also
be
styled
affections
connected
with
repentance
but
as
we
may
discover
the
meaning
of
paul
without
discussing
these
questions
we
shall
be
content
with
a
simple
exposition
of
them
he
says
then
that
godly
sorrow
produces
for
a
person
who
is
affected
with
a
serious
sense
of
displeasure
because
he
has
sinned
against
his
god
is
at
the
same
time
stimulated
to
diligence
and
attention
that
he
may
completely
extricate
himself
from
the
snares
of
the
devil
and
be
more
cautious
of
his
insidious
attacks
that
he
may
not
in
future
disobey
the
government
of
the
spirit
or
be
overcome
with
a
careless
security
the
next
thing
is
which
in
this
place
signifies
not
a
defence
by
which
a
sinner
tries
to
escape
the
judgment
of
god
either
by
denying
his
transgressions
or
extenuating
his
guilt
but
a
kind
of
excuse
consisting
rather
in
deprecation
of
punishment
than
in
confidence
of
his
cause
just
as
children
who
are
not
absolutely
lost
to
all
sense
of
duty
while
they
acknowledge
and
confess
their
faults
at
the
same
time
deprecate
punishment
and
in
order
to
succeed
testify
by
every
possible
method
that
they
have
not
cast
off
that
reverence
which
is
due
to
their
parents
in
a
word
they
excuse
themselves
in
such
a
manner
not
to
prove
themselves
righteous
and
innocent
but
only
to
obtain
pardon
this
is
followed
by
in
which
the
sinner
laments
within
himself
expostulates
with
himself
and
is
angry
with
himself
while
he
recollects
his
perverseness
and
ingratitude
to
god
the
word
denotes
that
trepidation
with
which
our
minds
are
penetrated
whenever
we
reflect
upon
our
demerits
and
on
the
terrible
severity
of
the
divine
wrath
against
sinners
for
we
can
not
but
be
agitated
with
an
amazing
inquietude
which
teaches
us
humility
and
renders
us
more
cautious
for
the
future
now
if
the
solicitude
before
mentioned
be
the
offspring
of
fear
we
see
the
connection
and
coherence
between
them
he
appears
to
me
to
have
used
the
word
to
denote
diligence
in
duty
and
alacrity
of
obedience
to
which
the
knowledge
of
our
faults
ought
to
be
a
most
powerful
stimulus
similar
to
this
is
the
meaning
of
which
he
immediately
subjoins
for
it
signifies
the
ardour
with
which
we
are
inflamed
when
we
are
roused
with
such
thoughts
as
these
what
have
i
done
whither
had
i
precipitated
myself
if
i
had
not
been
succoured
by
the
mercy
of
god
the
last
thing
is
or
punishment
for
the
greater
our
severity
is
towards
ourselves
and
the
stricter
inquisition
we
make
concerning
our
sins
so
much
the
stronger
hope
ought
we
to
entertain
that
god
will
be
propitious
and
merciful
and
indeed
it
is
impossible
but
that
a
soul
impressed
with
a
dread
of
the
divine
judgment
must
inflict
some
punishment
on
itself
truly
pious
persons
experience
what
punishments
are
contained
in
shame
confusion
lamentation
displeasure
with
themselves
and
the
other
affections
which
arise
from
a
serious
acknowledgment
of
their
transgressions
but
let
us
remember
that
some
limit
must
be
observed
that
we
may
not
be
overwhelmed
in
sorrow
for
to
nothing
are
terrified
consciences
more
liable
than
to
fall
into
despair
and
with
this
artifice
also
whomsoever
satan
perceives
to
be
dejected
by
a
fear
of
god
he
plunges
them
further
and
further
into
the
deep
gulf
of
sorrow
that
they
may
never
arise
again
that
fear
indeed
can
not
be
excessive
which
terminates
in
humility
and
departs
not
from
the
hope
of
pardon
nevertheless
the
sinner
should
always
be
on
his
guard
according
to
the
direction
of
the
apostle
lest
while
he
excites
his
heart
to
be
displeased
with
himself
he
be
with
excessive
dread
and
in
his
for
this
would
drive
us
away
from
god
who
calls
us
to
himself
by
repentance
on
this
subject
bernard
also
gives
a
very
useful
admonition
sorrow
for
sin
is
necessary
if
it
be
not
perpetual
i
advise
you
sometimes
to
quit
the
anxious
and
painful
recollection
of
your
own
ways
and
to
arise
to
an
agreeable
and
serene
remembrance
of
the
divine
blessings
let
us
mingle
honey
with
wormwood
that
its
salutary
bitterness
may
restore
our
health
when
it
shall
be
drunk
tempered
with
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
if
you
reflect
on
your
own
meanness
reflect
also
on
the
goodness
of
the
xvi
now
it
may
also
be
understood
what
are
the
fruits
of
repentance
they
are
the
duties
of
piety
towards
god
and
of
charity
towards
men
with
sanctity
and
purity
in
our
whole
life
in
a
word
the
more
diligently
any
one
examines
his
life
by
the
rule
of
the
divine
law
so
much
the
more
certain
evidences
he
discovers
of
his
repentance
the
spirit
therefore
in
frequently
exhorting
us
to
repentance
calls
our
attention
sometimes
to
all
the
precepts
of
the
law
sometimes
to
the
duties
of
the
second
table
though
in
other
places
after
having
condemned
impurity
in
the
very
fountain
of
the
heart
he
proceeds
to
those
external
testimonies
which
evidence
a
sincere
repentance
a
view
of
which
i
will
soon
exhibit
to
the
reader
in
a
description
of
the
christian
life
i
shall
not
collect
testimonies
from
the
prophets
in
which
they
partly
ridicule
the
follies
of
those
who
attempt
to
appease
god
by
ceremonies
and
demonstrate
them
to
be
mere
mockeries
and
partly
inculcate
that
external
integrity
of
life
is
not
the
principal
branch
of
repentance
because
god
looks
at
the
heart
he
that
is
but
ordinarily
acquainted
with
the
scripture
will
discover
of
himself
without
being
informed
by
any
one
that
in
our
concerns
with
god
we
advance
not
a
single
step
unless
we
begin
with
the
internal
affection
of
the
heart
and
this
passage
of
joel
will
afford
us
no
small
assistance
in
the
interpretation
of
others
rend
your
heart
and
not
your
both
these
ideas
are
briefly
expressed
in
these
words
of
cleanse
your
hands
ye
sinners
and
purify
your
hearts
ye
double
minded
where
there
is
indeed
an
addition
made
to
the
first
clause
but
the
fountain
or
original
is
next
discovered
showing
the
necessity
of
cleansing
the
secret
pollution
that
an
altar
may
be
erected
to
god
even
in
the
heart
there
are
likewise
some
external
exercises
which
we
use
in
private
as
remedies
either
to
humble
ourselves
or
to
subdue
our
carnality
and
in
public
to
testify
our
repentance
they
proceed
from
the
revenge
mentioned
by
paul
for
it
is
natural
to
an
afflicted
mind
to
continue
in
a
squalid
condition
groaning
and
weeping
to
avoid
every
kind
of
splendour
and
pomp
and
to
forsake
all
pleasures
he
who
experiences
the
great
evil
of
the
rebellion
of
the
flesh
seeks
every
remedy
to
restrain
it
he
who
properly
considers
what
a
grievous
thing
it
is
to
have
offended
the
justice
of
god
can
enjoy
no
repose
till
he
has
glorified
god
by
his
humility
such
exercises
are
frequently
mentioned
by
the
old
writers
when
they
speak
of
the
fruits
of
repentance
and
though
they
by
no
means
make
repentance
wholly
to
consist
in
them
yet
the
reader
will
pardon
me
if
i
deliver
my
opinion
that
they
appear
to
me
to
insist
upon
them
more
than
they
ought
and
i
hope
every
one
on
a
sober
examination
will
agree
with
me
that
they
have
gone
beyond
all
due
bounds
in
two
respects
for
when
they
so
strongly
urged
and
so
extravagantly
recommended
that
corporeal
discipline
the
consequence
was
indeed
that
the
common
people
adopted
it
with
great
ardour
but
they
also
obscured
that
which
ought
to
be
esteemed
of
infinitely
greater
importance
secondly
in
the
infliction
of
castigations
they
used
rather
more
rigour
than
was
consistent
with
ecclesiastical
gentleness
but
we
shall
have
to
treat
of
this
in
another
place
xvii
but
as
some
persons
when
they
find
weeping
fasting
and
ashes
mentioned
not
only
in
many
other
passages
of
scripture
but
particularly
in
joel
consider
fasting
and
weeping
as
the
principal
part
of
repentance
their
mistake
requires
to
be
rectified
what
is
there
said
of
the
conversion
of
the
whole
heart
to
the
lord
and
of
rending
not
the
garments
but
the
heart
properly
belongs
to
repentance
but
weeping
and
fasting
are
not
added
as
perpetual
or
necessary
effects
of
it
but
as
circumstances
belonging
to
a
particular
case
having
prophesied
that
a
most
grievous
destruction
was
impending
over
the
jews
he
persuades
them
to
prevent
the
divine
wrath
not
only
by
repentance
but
also
by
exhibiting
external
demonstrations
of
sorrow
for
as
it
was
customary
in
ancient
times
for
an
accused
person
to
present
himself
in
a
suppliant
posture
with
a
long
beard
dishevelled
hair
and
mourning
apparel
in
order
to
conciliate
the
compassion
of
the
judge
so
it
became
those
who
stood
as
criminals
before
the
tribunal
of
god
to
deprecate
his
severity
in
a
condition
calculated
to
excite
commiseration
though
sackcloth
and
ashes
were
perhaps
more
suitable
to
those
times
yet
it
is
evident
that
the
practice
of
weeping
and
fasting
would
be
very
seasonable
among
us
whenever
the
lord
appears
to
threaten
us
with
any
affliction
or
calamity
for
when
he
causes
danger
to
appear
he
as
it
were
denounces
that
he
is
prepared
and
armed
for
the
exercise
of
vengeance
the
prophet
therefore
was
right
in
exhorting
his
countrymen
to
weeping
and
fasting
that
is
to
the
sadness
of
persons
under
accusation
into
whose
offences
he
had
just
before
said
that
an
examination
was
instituted
neither
would
the
pastors
of
the
church
act
improperly
in
the
present
age
if
when
they
perceived
calamity
impending
over
the
heads
of
their
people
they
called
them
to
immediate
weeping
and
fasting
provided
they
always
insisted
with
the
greatest
fervour
and
diligence
on
the
principal
point
which
is
that
they
must
rend
their
hearts
and
not
their
garments
it
is
certain
that
fasting
is
not
always
the
concomitant
of
repentance
but
is
appointed
for
times
of
peculiar
calamity
wherefore
christ
connects
it
with
mourning
when
he
frees
the
apostles
from
any
obligation
to
it
till
they
should
be
affected
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
his
presence
i
speak
of
solemn
fasting
for
the
life
of
the
pious
ought
at
all
times
to
be
regulated
by
frugality
and
sobriety
that
through
its
whole
progress
it
may
appear
to
be
a
kind
of
perpetual
fast
but
as
the
whole
of
this
subject
must
be
discussed
again
when
we
come
to
treat
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
i
touch
the
more
slightly
upon
it
at
present
xviii
i
will
again
remark
however
that
when
the
word
is
transferred
to
this
external
profession
it
is
improperly
changed
from
the
genuine
signification
which
i
have
stated
for
this
external
profession
is
not
so
much
a
conversion
to
god
as
a
confession
of
sin
with
a
deprecation
of
punishment
and
guilt
thus
to
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
is
only
a
declaration
of
our
displeasure
against
ourselves
when
god
is
angry
with
us
on
account
of
our
grievous
offences
and
this
is
a
public
species
of
confession
by
which
condemning
ourselves
before
angels
and
men
we
prevent
the
judgment
of
god
for
paul
rebukes
the
sluggishness
of
those
who
indulge
their
sins
saying
if
we
would
judge
ourselves
we
should
not
be
it
is
not
necessary
in
all
cases
publicly
to
make
men
witnesses
of
our
repentance
but
a
private
confession
to
god
is
a
branch
of
true
penitence
which
can
not
be
omitted
for
nothing
is
more
unreasonable
than
that
god
should
pardon
sins
in
which
we
encourage
ourselves
and
which
lest
he
should
bring
them
to
light
we
conceal
under
the
garb
of
hypocrisy
and
it
is
not
only
necessary
to
confess
the
sins
which
we
commit
from
day
to
day
more
grievous
falls
ought
to
lead
us
further
and
to
recall
to
our
remembrance
those
which
appear
to
have
been
long
buried
in
oblivion
we
learn
this
from
the
example
of
david
for
being
ashamed
of
a
recent
and
flagitious
crime
he
examines
himself
back
to
the
time
of
his
conception
and
acknowledges
that
even
then
he
was
corrupted
and
contaminated
with
carnal
impurity
and
this
not
to
extenuate
his
guilt
as
many
conceal
themselves
in
a
multitude
and
endeavour
to
escape
with
impunity
by
implicating
others
with
themselves
very
different
was
the
conduct
of
david
who
ingenuously
aggravated
his
guilt
by
confessing
that
he
was
corrupted
from
his
earliest
infancy
and
had
never
ceased
to
accumulate
crimes
upon
crimes
in
another
place
also
he
enters
on
such
an
examination
of
his
past
life
that
he
implores
the
divine
mercy
to
pardon
the
sins
of
his
youth
and
certainly
we
shall
never
give
proof
that
we
have
shaken
off
our
lethargy
till
groaning
under
the
burden
and
bewailing
our
misery
we
pray
to
god
for
relief
it
is
further
to
be
remarked
that
the
repentance
which
we
are
commanded
constantly
to
practise
differs
from
that
which
arouses
as
it
were
from
death
those
who
have
either
fallen
into
some
great
enormity
or
abandoned
themselves
to
a
course
of
sin
with
unrestrained
license
or
by
any
rebellion
shaken
off
the
divine
yoke
for
when
the
scripture
exhorts
to
repentance
it
frequently
signifies
a
kind
of
transition
and
resurrection
from
death
to
life
and
when
it
states
that
the
people
repented
it
means
that
they
departed
from
idolatry
and
other
gross
enormities
in
which
sense
paul
declares
his
grief
for
sinners
who
have
not
repented
of
their
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
this
difference
should
be
carefully
observed
lest
when
we
hear
that
few
are
called
to
repentance
we
fall
into
a
supine
security
as
though
we
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
from
which
the
depraved
appetites
that
perpetually
disturb
us
and
the
vices
that
often
arise
in
us
will
never
permit
us
to
relax
the
special
repentance
therefore
which
is
only
required
of
some
whom
the
devil
has
seduced
from
the
fear
of
god
and
entangled
in
his
fatal
snares
supersedes
not
that
ordinary
repentance
which
the
corruption
of
nature
obliges
us
to
practise
during
the
whole
course
of
our
lives
xix
now
if
it
be
true
as
it
certainly
is
that
the
whole
substance
of
the
gospel
is
comprised
in
these
two
points
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
not
we
perceive
that
the
lord
freely
justifies
his
children
that
he
may
also
restore
them
to
true
righteousness
by
the
sanctification
of
his
spirit
john
the
messenger
sent
before
the
face
of
christ
to
prepare
his
way
before
him
preached
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
by
calling
men
to
repentance
he
taught
them
to
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
sinners
and
every
thing
belonging
to
them
to
be
condemned
before
god
that
they
might
earnestly
desire
and
pray
for
a
mortification
of
the
flesh
and
new
regeneration
in
the
spirit
by
announcing
the
kingdom
of
god
he
called
them
to
exercise
faith
for
by
the
kingdom
of
god
the
approach
of
which
he
proclaimed
he
intended
remission
of
sins
salvation
life
and
in
general
all
the
benefits
that
we
obtain
in
christ
wherefore
in
the
other
evangelists
it
is
said
that
john
came
preaching
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
what
was
intended
by
this
but
that
oppressed
and
wearied
with
the
burden
of
sins
men
should
turn
themselves
to
the
lord
and
entertain
a
hope
of
remission
and
salvation
thus
also
christ
commenced
his
public
ministrations
the
kingdom
of
god
is
at
hand
repent
ye
and
believe
the
first
he
declares
that
the
treasures
of
mercy
are
opened
in
himself
then
he
requires
repentance
and
lastly
a
reliance
on
the
divine
promises
therefore
when
he
would
give
a
brief
summary
of
the
whole
gospel
he
said
that
it
behoved
him
to
suffer
and
to
rise
from
the
dead
and
that
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
should
be
preached
in
his
the
apostles
also
after
his
resurrection
preached
that
he
was
exalted
by
god
to
give
repentance
to
israel
and
remission
of
repentance
is
preached
in
the
name
of
christ
when
men
are
informed
by
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
that
all
their
thoughts
their
affections
and
their
pursuits
are
corrupt
and
vicious
and
that
therefore
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
be
born
again
if
they
wish
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
remission
of
sins
is
preached
when
men
are
taught
that
christ
is
made
unto
them
wisdom
and
righteousness
and
sanctification
and
redemption
in
whose
name
they
are
gratuitously
accounted
righteous
and
innocent
in
the
sight
of
god
both
these
blessings
of
grace
as
we
have
already
shown
are
apprehended
by
faith
yet
since
the
goodness
of
god
in
the
remission
of
sins
is
the
peculiar
object
of
faith
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
carefully
distinguished
from
repentance
xx
now
as
a
hatred
of
sin
which
is
the
commencement
of
repentance
is
our
first
introduction
to
the
knowledge
of
christ
who
reveals
himself
to
none
but
miserable
and
distressed
sinners
who
mourn
and
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
who
hunger
and
thirst
and
are
pining
away
with
grief
and
misery
so
it
is
necessary
for
us
if
we
desire
to
abide
in
christ
to
strive
for
this
repentance
to
devote
our
whole
lives
to
it
and
to
pursue
it
to
the
last
for
he
came
to
call
sinners
but
it
was
to
call
them
to
he
was
sent
to
bless
the
unworthy
but
it
was
in
turning
away
every
one
from
his
the
scripture
is
full
of
such
expressions
wherefore
when
god
offers
remission
of
sins
he
generally
requires
repentance
on
the
part
of
the
sinner
implying
that
his
mercy
ought
to
furnish
a
motive
to
excite
us
to
repentance
keep
ye
judgment
and
do
justice
for
my
salvation
is
again
the
redeemer
shall
come
to
zion
and
unto
them
that
turn
from
transgression
in
again
seek
ye
the
lord
while
he
may
be
found
call
ye
upon
him
while
he
is
near
let
the
wicked
forsake
his
way
and
the
unrighteous
man
his
thoughts
and
let
him
return
unto
the
lord
and
he
will
have
mercy
upon
again
repent
and
be
converted
that
your
sins
may
be
blotted
here
it
must
be
remarked
however
that
this
condition
is
not
annexed
in
such
a
manner
as
though
our
repentance
were
the
fundamental
and
meritorious
cause
of
pardon
but
rather
because
the
lord
has
determined
to
have
mercy
upon
men
in
order
that
they
may
repent
he
informs
them
what
course
they
must
take
if
they
wish
to
obtain
his
favour
therefore
as
long
as
we
inhabit
the
prison
of
our
body
we
shall
have
to
maintain
an
incessant
conflict
with
the
vices
of
our
corrupt
nature
and
even
with
our
natural
soul
plato
sometimes
says
that
the
life
of
a
philosopher
is
a
meditation
of
death
we
may
assert
with
more
truth
that
the
life
of
a
christian
is
perpetually
employed
in
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
till
it
is
utterly
destroyed
and
the
spirit
of
god
obtains
the
sole
empire
within
us
wherefore
i
think
that
he
has
made
a
very
considerable
proficiency
who
has
learned
to
be
exceedingly
displeased
with
himself
not
that
he
should
remain
in
this
distress
and
advance
no
further
but
rather
hasten
and
aspire
towards
god
that
being
ingrafted
into
the
death
and
life
of
christ
he
may
make
repentance
the
object
of
his
constant
meditation
and
pursuit
and
this
can
not
but
be
the
conduct
of
those
who
feel
a
genuine
hatred
of
sin
for
no
man
ever
hated
sin
without
having
been
previously
captivated
with
the
love
of
righteousness
this
doctrine
as
it
is
the
most
simple
of
all
so
also
it
appears
to
me
to
be
most
consistent
with
the
truth
of
the
scripture
xxi
that
repentance
is
a
peculiar
gift
of
god
must
i
think
be
so
evident
from
the
doctrine
just
stated
as
to
preclude
the
necessity
of
a
long
discourse
to
prove
it
therefore
the
church
praises
and
admires
the
goodness
of
god
that
he
hath
granted
to
the
gentiles
repentance
unto
life
and
paul
when
he
enjoins
timothy
to
be
patient
and
gentle
towards
unbelievers
says
if
god
peradventure
will
give
them
repentance
that
they
may
recover
themselves
out
of
the
snare
of
the
god
affirms
indeed
that
he
wills
the
conversion
of
all
men
and
directs
his
exhortations
promiscuously
to
all
but
the
efficacy
of
these
exhortations
depends
on
the
spirit
of
regeneration
for
it
were
more
easy
to
make
ourselves
men
than
by
our
own
power
to
endue
ourselves
with
a
more
excellent
nature
therefore
in
the
whole
course
of
regeneration
we
are
justly
styled
god
s
workmanship
created
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
whomsoever
god
chooses
to
rescue
from
destruction
them
he
vivifies
by
the
spirit
of
regeneration
not
that
repentance
is
properly
the
cause
of
salvation
but
because
as
we
have
already
seen
it
is
inseparable
from
faith
and
the
mercy
of
god
since
according
to
the
testimony
of
isaiah
the
redeemer
shall
come
to
zion
and
unto
them
that
turn
from
transgression
in
it
remains
an
unshaken
truth
that
wherever
the
fear
of
god
prevails
in
the
heart
the
spirit
has
operated
to
the
salvation
of
that
individual
therefore
in
isaiah
where
believers
are
bewailing
and
deploring
their
being
deserted
by
god
they
mention
this
as
a
sign
of
reprobation
that
their
hearts
are
hardened
by
him
the
apostle
also
intending
to
exclude
apostates
from
all
hope
of
salvation
asserts
as
a
reason
that
it
is
impossible
to
renew
them
again
unto
repentance
because
god
in
the
renewal
of
those
whom
he
will
not
suffer
to
perish
discovers
an
evidence
of
his
paternal
favour
and
attracts
them
to
himself
with
the
radiance
of
his
serene
and
joyful
countenance
whilst
on
the
contrary
he
displays
his
wrath
in
hardening
the
reprobate
whose
impiety
is
never
to
be
forgiven
this
kind
of
vengeance
the
apostle
denounces
against
wilful
apostates
who
when
they
depart
from
the
faith
of
the
gospel
deride
god
contumeliously
reject
his
grace
profane
and
trample
on
the
blood
of
christ
and
do
all
in
their
power
to
crucify
him
again
for
he
does
not
as
is
pretended
by
some
preposterously
severe
persons
preclude
all
voluntary
sinners
from
a
hope
of
pardon
his
design
is
to
show
that
apostasy
is
unworthy
of
every
excuse
and
therefore
it
is
not
strange
that
god
punishes
such
a
sacrilegious
contempt
of
himself
with
inexorable
rigour
for
it
is
impossible
he
tells
us
for
those
who
were
once
enlightened
and
have
tasted
of
the
heavenly
gift
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
holy
ghost
and
have
tasted
the
good
word
of
god
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
if
they
shall
fall
away
to
renew
them
again
unto
repentance
seeing
they
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
afresh
and
put
him
to
an
open
again
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
for
sins
but
a
certain
fearful
of
these
are
the
passages
from
a
misinterpretation
of
which
the
novatians
formerly
derived
a
pretence
for
their
extravagant
opinions
and
the
apparent
harshness
of
which
has
offended
some
good
men
and
induced
them
to
believe
that
this
epistle
is
supposititious
though
every
part
of
it
contains
unequivocal
evidences
of
the
apostolic
spirit
but
as
we
are
contending
only
with
those
who
receive
it
it
is
easy
to
show
that
these
passages
afford
not
the
least
countenance
to
their
error
in
the
first
place
the
apostle
must
necessarily
be
in
unison
with
his
master
who
affirms
that
all
sin
and
blasphemy
shall
be
forgiven
unto
men
but
the
blasphemy
against
the
holy
ghost
which
shall
not
be
forgiven
neither
in
this
world
neither
in
the
world
to
the
apostle
i
say
must
certainly
have
been
content
with
this
exception
unless
we
wish
to
make
him
an
enemy
to
the
grace
of
christ
whence
it
follows
that
pardon
is
denied
to
no
particular
sins
except
one
which
proceeds
from
desperate
fury
and
can
not
be
attributed
to
infirmity
but
clearly
proves
a
man
to
be
possessed
by
the
devil
xxii
but
for
the
further
elucidation
of
this
subject
it
is
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
that
dreadful
crime
which
will
obtain
no
forgiveness
augustine
somewhere
defines
it
to
be
an
obstinate
perverseness
attended
with
a
despair
of
pardon
and
continued
till
death
but
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
language
of
christ
that
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
in
this
for
either
this
is
a
vain
assertion
or
the
sin
may
be
committed
in
this
life
but
if
the
definition
of
augustine
be
right
it
is
never
committed
unless
it
continue
till
death
others
say
that
a
man
sins
against
the
holy
ghost
who
envies
the
grace
bestowed
on
his
brother
i
know
no
foundation
for
this
notion
but
we
will
adduce
the
true
definition
which
when
it
shall
have
been
proved
by
strong
testimonies
will
of
itself
easily
overturn
all
others
i
say
then
that
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
is
committed
by
those
who
though
they
are
so
overpowered
with
the
splendour
of
divine
truth
that
they
can
not
pretend
ignorance
nevertheless
resist
it
with
determined
malice
merely
for
the
sake
of
resisting
it
for
christ
in
explanation
of
what
he
had
asserted
immediately
subjoins
whosoever
speaketh
a
word
against
the
son
of
man
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
but
whosoever
speaketh
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
and
matthew
instead
of
blasphemy
against
the
spirit
says
blasphemy
of
the
how
can
any
one
cast
a
reproach
on
the
son
that
is
not
also
directed
against
the
spirit
those
who
unadvisedly
offend
against
the
truth
of
god
which
they
know
not
and
who
ignorantly
revile
christ
but
at
the
same
time
have
such
a
disposition
that
they
would
not
extinguish
the
divine
truth
if
revealed
to
them
or
utter
one
injurious
word
against
him
whom
they
knew
to
be
the
lord
s
christ
sin
against
the
father
and
the
son
thus
there
are
many
in
the
present
day
who
most
inveterately
execrate
the
doctrines
of
the
gospel
which
if
they
knew
to
be
the
evangelical
doctrine
they
would
be
ready
to
venerate
with
their
whole
heart
but
those
who
are
convinced
in
their
conscience
that
it
is
the
word
of
god
which
they
reject
and
oppose
and
yet
continue
their
opposition
are
said
to
blaspheme
against
the
spirit
because
they
strive
against
the
illumination
which
is
the
work
of
the
holy
spirit
such
were
some
among
the
jews
who
when
they
were
not
able
to
resist
the
spirit
that
spake
by
stephen
yet
obstinately
strove
to
resist
many
of
them
were
undoubtedly
urged
to
this
conduct
by
a
zeal
for
the
law
but
it
appears
that
there
were
others
who
were
infuriated
by
a
malignant
impiety
against
god
himself
that
is
against
the
doctrine
which
they
knew
to
be
from
god
such
also
were
the
pharisees
whom
the
lord
rebuked
who
in
order
to
counteract
the
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
slanderously
ascribed
it
to
the
power
of
beelzebub
this
then
is
blasphemy
of
the
spirit
where
the
presumption
of
man
deliberately
strives
to
annihilate
the
glory
of
god
this
is
implied
in
the
observation
of
paul
that
he
obtained
mercy
because
he
had
ignorantly
in
unbelief
committed
those
crimes
the
demerits
of
which
would
otherwise
have
excluded
him
from
the
grace
of
the
lord
if
the
union
of
ignorance
and
unbelief
was
the
reason
of
his
obtaining
pardon
it
follows
that
there
is
no
room
for
pardon
where
unbelief
has
been
attended
with
knowledge
xxiii
but
on
a
careful
observation
you
will
perceive
that
the
apostle
speaks
not
of
one
or
more
particular
falls
but
of
the
universal
defection
by
which
the
reprobate
exclude
themselves
from
salvation
we
need
not
wonder
that
those
whom
john
in
his
canonical
epistle
affirms
not
to
have
been
of
the
number
of
the
elect
from
whom
they
departed
experience
god
to
be
implacable
towards
them
for
he
directs
his
discourse
against
those
who
imagined
that
they
might
return
to
the
christian
religion
although
they
had
once
apostatized
from
it
to
whom
he
contradicts
this
false
and
pernicious
notion
declaring
what
is
absolutely
true
that
it
is
impossible
for
persons
to
return
to
the
communion
of
christ
who
have
knowingly
and
wilfully
rejected
it
and
it
is
rejected
not
by
those
who
simply
transgress
the
word
of
the
lord
by
a
dissolute
and
licentious
life
but
by
those
who
professedly
renounce
all
his
doctrines
therefore
the
fallacy
lies
in
the
terms
and
for
the
novatians
explain
to
take
place
when
any
one
after
having
been
instructed
by
the
law
of
the
lord
that
theft
and
fornication
ought
not
to
be
committed
yet
abstains
not
from
either
of
these
sins
but
on
the
contrary
i
affirm
that
there
is
a
tacit
antithesis
understood
which
ought
to
contain
a
repetition
of
all
the
opposites
of
the
things
which
had
been
previously
mentioned
so
that
this
passage
expresses
not
any
particular
vice
but
a
universal
defection
from
god
and
if
i
may
use
the
expression
an
apostasy
of
the
whole
man
when
he
speaks
therefore
of
some
who
fell
away
after
they
were
once
enlightened
and
had
tasted
of
the
heavenly
gift
and
were
made
partakers
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
it
must
be
understood
of
persons
who
with
deliberate
impiety
have
smothered
the
light
of
the
spirit
rejected
the
taste
of
the
heavenly
gift
alienated
themselves
from
the
sanctification
of
the
spirit
and
trampled
on
the
word
of
god
and
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
and
the
more
fully
to
express
that
decided
determination
of
impiety
he
afterwards
in
another
place
adds
the
word
for
when
he
says
that
if
we
sin
wilfully
after
that
we
have
received
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
there
remaineth
no
more
sacrifice
he
denies
not
that
christ
is
a
perpetual
sacrifice
to
expiate
the
iniquities
of
the
saints
which
almost
the
whole
epistle
expressly
proclaims
in
describing
the
priesthood
of
christ
but
intends
that
there
remains
no
other
where
that
is
rejected
but
it
is
rejected
when
the
truth
of
the
gospel
is
avowedly
renounced
xxiv
the
objection
of
some
who
conceive
it
to
be
severe
and
inconsistent
with
the
divine
clemency
that
pardon
should
be
refused
to
any
who
flee
to
the
lord
imploring
his
mercy
is
easily
answered
for
he
affirms
not
that
pardon
is
denied
to
them
if
they
turn
themselves
to
the
lord
but
he
absolutely
denies
the
possibility
of
their
attaining
to
repentance
because
they
are
stricken
with
eternal
blindness
by
the
righteous
judgment
of
god
on
account
of
their
ingratitude
nor
is
it
any
objection
that
the
same
apostle
afterwards
accommodates
to
this
subject
the
example
of
esau
who
vainly
endeavoured
with
weeping
and
lamentation
to
recover
his
lost
rights
of
primogeniture
nor
that
the
prophet
utters
this
denunciation
though
they
shall
cry
unto
me
i
will
not
hearken
unto
for
such
forms
of
expression
signify
neither
true
conversion
nor
invocation
of
god
but
the
anxiety
felt
by
the
impious
in
extreme
calamity
which
constrains
them
to
consider
what
before
they
carelessly
disregarded
that
nothing
can
do
them
any
good
but
the
assistance
of
the
lord
and
this
they
do
not
so
much
implore
as
bewail
its
being
withheld
from
them
therefore
the
prophet
intends
by
and
the
apostle
by
only
that
dreadful
torment
which
excruciates
the
impious
with
the
agonies
of
despair
this
requires
to
be
carefully
observed
because
otherwise
this
procedure
of
god
would
contradict
his
proclamation
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophet
that
as
soon
as
the
sinner
shall
have
turned
he
will
be
propitious
to
him
and
as
i
have
already
remarked
it
is
certain
that
the
human
mind
is
not
changed
for
the
better
except
by
the
previous
influence
of
his
grace
nor
will
his
promise
respecting
those
who
call
upon
him
ever
deceive
but
it
is
improper
to
apply
the
terms
and
to
that
blind
torment
by
which
the
reprobate
are
distracted
when
they
see
that
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
seek
god
in
order
to
find
a
remedy
for
their
miseries
while
at
the
same
time
they
continue
to
flee
from
his
approach
xxv
but
it
is
inquired
since
the
apostle
denies
that
god
is
appeased
by
a
hypocritical
repentance
how
ahab
obtained
pardon
and
averted
the
punishment
with
which
he
had
been
threatened
though
he
appears
from
the
subsequent
tenor
of
his
life
to
have
been
only
terrified
by
a
sudden
consternation
he
clothed
himself
with
sackcloth
sprinkled
ashes
upon
his
head
lay
on
the
ground
and
as
it
is
declared
concerning
him
humbled
himself
before
god
but
it
was
nothing
to
rend
his
garments
while
his
heart
remained
perverse
and
inflated
with
wickedness
yet
we
see
how
god
is
inclined
to
clemency
i
reply
that
sometimes
hypocrites
are
thus
spared
for
a
season
yet
that
the
wrath
of
god
always
abides
upon
them
and
that
this
is
done
not
so
much
for
their
sakes
as
for
a
public
example
for
what
benefit
did
ahab
receive
from
the
mitigation
of
the
threatened
punishment
but
a
respite
from
it
during
his
continuance
in
this
world
the
malediction
of
god
therefore
although
concealed
fixed
itself
in
his
family
and
he
himself
went
forward
to
eternal
perdition
the
same
may
be
observed
in
the
case
of
esau
for
though
he
suffered
a
repulse
yet
a
temporal
benediction
was
granted
to
his
tears
but
since
the
spiritual
inheritance
according
to
the
oracle
of
god
could
remain
only
with
one
of
the
brothers
when
jacob
was
chosen
and
esau
rejected
that
preterition
shut
out
the
divine
mercy
yet
this
consolation
was
left
to
him
as
to
a
man
on
a
level
with
the
brutes
that
he
should
be
enriched
with
the
fatness
of
the
earth
and
the
dew
of
this
is
what
i
have
just
observed
ought
to
be
considered
as
an
example
to
others
that
we
may
learn
to
devote
our
minds
and
our
exertions
with
more
alacrity
to
sincere
repentance
because
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
those
who
are
truly
and
cordially
converted
will
find
god
readily
disposed
to
forgiveness
whose
clemency
extends
itself
even
to
the
unworthy
as
long
as
they
manifest
any
appearance
of
contrition
at
the
same
time
also
we
are
taught
what
dreadful
vengeance
awaits
all
the
obstinate
who
with
impudent
countenances
and
hardened
hearts
despise
disregard
and
ridicule
the
divine
threatenings
thus
he
frequently
extended
his
hand
to
the
children
of
israel
to
alleviate
their
distresses
notwithstanding
their
supplications
were
hypocritical
and
their
hearts
full
of
duplicity
and
perfidy
as
he
complains
in
one
of
the
psalms
that
they
immediately
after
returned
to
their
former
courses
he
designed
by
his
merciful
kindness
either
to
bring
them
to
a
serious
conversion
or
to
render
them
inexcusable
yet
by
the
temporary
remission
of
punishments
he
imposes
on
himself
no
perpetual
law
but
sometimes
arises
against
hypocrites
with
the
greater
severity
and
enhances
their
punishments
to
manifest
his
extreme
displeasure
against
hypocrisy
but
he
exhibits
as
i
have
observed
some
examples
of
his
readiness
to
pardon
in
order
to
animate
the
pious
to
a
correction
of
their
lives
and
the
more
severely
to
condemn
the
pride
of
those
who
obstinately
kick
against
the
goads
chapter
iv
the
sophistry
and
jargon
of
the
schools
concerning
repentance
very
remote
from
the
purity
of
the
gospel
on
confession
and
satisfaction
i
come
now
to
the
discussion
of
those
things
which
have
been
advanced
by
the
sophists
of
the
schools
concerning
repentance
which
i
shall
run
over
as
briefly
as
possible
for
it
is
not
my
design
to
pursue
the
subject
at
large
lest
this
book
which
i
am
endeavouring
to
make
a
compendium
of
doctrine
should
be
drawn
out
to
an
immoderate
extent
they
have
involved
a
subject
otherwise
not
very
intricate
in
so
many
perplexities
that
those
who
have
entered
but
a
little
way
into
their
labyrinths
will
not
find
it
easy
to
extricate
themselves
in
the
first
place
the
definition
they
have
given
of
repentance
clearly
shows
that
they
never
understood
what
it
was
for
they
catch
at
some
passages
in
the
writings
of
the
fathers
which
by
no
means
express
the
nature
of
repentance
as
that
to
repent
is
to
weep
for
sins
previously
committed
and
not
to
commit
sins
to
be
wept
again
that
it
is
to
lament
evils
that
are
past
and
not
to
commit
new
ones
to
be
again
that
it
is
a
kind
of
mournful
vengeance
punishing
in
ourselves
what
we
bewail
having
again
that
it
is
a
sorrow
of
heart
and
bitterness
of
soul
on
account
of
the
evils
which
a
man
has
committed
or
to
which
he
has
but
though
we
concede
that
these
expressions
were
properly
used
by
the
fathers
which
however
a
contentious
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
denying
yet
they
were
used
not
with
a
view
to
describe
repentance
but
only
to
exhort
their
readers
to
avoid
relapsing
into
those
crimes
from
which
they
had
been
delivered
but
if
we
are
disposed
to
convert
all
observations
of
this
kind
into
definitions
others
may
be
added
with
equal
propriety
as
this
of
chrysostom
repentance
is
a
medicine
which
destroys
sin
a
gift
bestowed
from
heaven
an
admirable
virtue
a
grace
exceeding
the
power
of
moreover
the
doctrine
which
they
afterwards
advance
is
still
worse
than
these
definitions
for
they
are
so
obstinately
riveted
to
external
exercises
that
one
can
collect
nothing
else
from
immense
volumes
but
that
repentance
is
an
austere
discipline
which
serves
partly
to
subdue
the
flesh
partly
to
chastise
and
punish
vices
but
concerning
the
internal
renovation
of
the
mind
which
is
attended
with
a
real
reformation
of
the
life
they
observe
a
wonderful
silence
of
and
indeed
they
treat
largely
they
torment
souls
with
a
multitude
of
scruples
and
drive
them
to
extreme
trouble
and
anxiety
but
when
they
appear
to
have
thoroughly
wounded
the
heart
they
heal
all
the
bitterness
by
a
slight
sprinkling
of
ceremonies
having
thus
quaintly
defined
repentance
they
divide
it
into
contrition
of
heart
confession
of
mouth
and
satisfaction
of
division
which
is
no
more
agreeable
to
the
rules
of
logic
than
their
definition
though
they
would
be
thought
to
have
spent
their
whole
lives
in
composing
syllogisms
but
should
any
one
reason
from
the
definition
which
is
a
kind
of
argumentation
common
among
logicians
that
a
man
may
weep
for
sins
previously
committed
and
commit
no
more
to
be
wept
for
may
lament
evils
that
are
past
and
commit
no
more
to
be
lamented
may
punish
what
he
mourns
that
he
has
committed
although
he
makes
no
confession
with
his
mouth
how
will
they
defend
their
division
for
if
he
who
confesses
not
be
nevertheless
truly
penitent
repentance
may
exist
where
there
is
no
confession
but
if
they
reply
that
this
division
refers
to
repentance
as
a
sacrament
or
is
to
be
understood
of
the
complete
perfection
of
repentance
which
they
comprehend
not
in
their
definition
they
have
no
reason
to
accuse
me
let
them
impute
the
blame
to
themselves
for
not
giving
definitions
with
more
correctness
and
perspicuity
for
myself
indeed
according
to
my
dull
capacity
in
all
controversies
i
refer
every
thing
to
the
definition
which
is
the
hinge
and
foundation
of
the
whole
argument
but
admitting
this
to
be
their
magisterial
license
we
proceed
to
an
attentive
examination
of
the
parts
themselves
in
order
when
i
neglect
and
pass
over
as
frivolous
things
which
with
supercilious
gravity
they
represent
as
mysteries
i
never
do
it
without
design
not
that
i
should
find
it
very
laborious
to
canvass
the
arguments
in
which
they
conceive
themselves
to
have
discovered
most
shrewdness
and
subtilty
but
i
could
not
conscientiously
fatigue
my
readers
with
such
impertinences
to
no
good
purpose
from
the
questions
which
they
raise
and
agitate
and
with
which
they
miserably
embarrass
themselves
it
is
easy
to
see
that
they
talk
of
subjects
of
which
they
are
utterly
ignorant
such
as
this
whether
repentance
for
one
sin
be
pleasing
to
god
during
an
obstinate
continuance
in
others
again
whether
punishments
inflicted
by
god
be
available
for
satisfaction
again
whether
repentance
may
be
frequently
repeated
for
mortal
sins
on
this
point
they
shamefully
and
impiously
determine
that
repentance
is
daily
practised
only
for
venial
sins
they
also
torment
themselves
much
with
a
gross
error
in
an
expression
of
jerome
that
repentance
is
a
second
plank
after
a
shipwreck
thus
giving
proof
that
they
have
never
been
awakened
from
their
brutish
stupidity
so
as
to
have
even
the
most
distant
view
of
the
thousandth
part
of
their
sins
ii
i
wish
the
reader
to
consider
that
this
is
not
a
contention
about
an
insignificant
trifle
but
a
question
respecting
the
most
serious
of
all
of
sins
for
by
requiring
in
repentance
compunction
of
heart
confession
of
mouth
and
satisfaction
of
work
they
maintain
that
these
three
things
are
necessary
to
procure
the
remission
of
sins
but
if
it
be
important
for
us
to
know
any
thing
in
the
whole
science
of
religion
it
is
certainly
of
the
greatest
importance
to
apprehend
and
fully
to
understand
by
what
means
by
what
law
on
what
condition
and
with
what
facility
or
difficulty
remission
of
sins
may
be
obtained
unless
this
knowledge
be
clear
and
certain
the
conscience
can
have
no
rest
no
peace
with
god
no
confidence
or
security
but
is
the
subject
of
perpetual
trepidations
and
fluctuations
is
disturbed
tormented
and
harassed
and
dreads
hates
and
avoids
the
presence
of
god
but
if
remission
of
sins
depend
on
those
conditions
to
which
they
confine
it
we
are
in
a
most
miserable
and
deplorable
situation
they
make
contrition
the
first
step
towards
obtaining
pardon
and
require
such
as
is
due
from
us
that
is
such
as
is
just
and
perfect
but
they
have
not
determined
when
a
man
may
be
assured
that
he
has
arrived
at
this
degree
of
perfect
contrition
i
grant
indeed
that
every
man
ought
to
be
sedulously
and
earnestly
urged
that
by
bitterly
mourning
for
his
sins
he
may
continually
augment
his
displeasure
and
hatred
against
them
for
this
sorrow
worketh
repentance
to
salvation
not
to
be
repented
but
when
such
an
anguish
of
sorrow
is
required
as
may
correspond
to
the
magnitude
of
the
guilt
and
may
be
weighed
in
the
balance
with
confidence
of
pardon
then
the
wretched
conscience
is
wonderfully
tormented
and
agitated
when
it
sees
a
due
contrition
for
sins
imposed
on
it
and
understands
not
the
extent
of
the
debt
so
as
to
be
able
to
decide
with
itself
that
it
has
discharged
what
was
due
from
it
if
they
say
that
we
must
do
what
we
can
we
still
return
to
the
same
point
for
when
will
any
man
presume
to
flatter
himself
that
he
has
exerted
all
his
power
in
bewailing
his
sins
consciences
therefore
that
have
been
long
striving
with
themselves
and
exercised
in
tedious
conflicts
but
without
finding
at
length
any
place
of
rest
endeavour
to
procure
some
small
alleviation
extorting
from
themselves
some
sorrow
and
forcing
out
some
tears
to
complete
their
contrition
iii
if
they
charge
me
with
calumny
let
them
come
forth
and
produce
a
single
individual
who
has
not
by
this
doctrine
of
contrition
either
been
driven
into
despair
or
endeavoured
to
avert
the
divine
judgment
by
a
pretended
sorrow
instead
of
real
compunction
we
have
said
ourselves
that
forgiveness
of
sins
is
never
enjoyed
without
repentance
because
none
but
those
who
are
afflicted
and
wounded
with
a
consciousness
of
sins
can
sincerely
implore
the
mercy
of
god
but
we
have
likewise
added
that
repentance
is
not
the
cause
of
remission
of
sins
but
those
torments
of
soul
which
they
say
are
duties
to
be
performed
we
have
put
aside
we
have
taught
the
sinner
not
to
look
on
his
compunction
or
on
his
tears
but
to
fix
both
his
eyes
solely
on
the
mercy
of
god
we
have
only
declared
that
christ
called
the
labouring
and
when
he
was
sent
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
to
heal
the
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
and
to
comfort
all
that
this
would
exclude
the
pharisees
who
satisfied
with
their
own
righteousness
acknowledge
not
their
poverty
and
despisers
who
careless
of
the
wrath
of
god
seek
no
remedy
for
their
disease
for
such
neither
labour
nor
are
they
are
not
or
in
bondage
or
in
captivity
but
there
is
a
considerable
difference
whether
a
man
be
taught
to
merit
remission
of
sins
by
a
true
and
perfect
contrition
which
no
sinner
can
ever
perform
or
be
instructed
to
hunger
and
thirst
for
the
divine
mercy
that
by
the
knowledge
of
his
misery
by
his
disquietude
fatigue
and
captivity
he
may
be
shown
where
he
ought
to
seek
for
consolation
rest
and
liberty
and
may
learn
to
glorify
god
by
his
humility
iv
concerning
confession
there
has
always
been
a
great
controversy
between
the
canonists
and
the
scholastic
divines
the
latter
contending
that
confession
is
commanded
by
the
word
of
god
the
other
on
the
contrary
maintaining
that
it
is
enjoined
only
by
the
ecclesiastical
constitutions
but
this
controversy
has
discovered
the
singular
impudence
of
the
theologians
who
have
corrupted
and
violently
distorted
all
the
passages
of
scripture
which
they
have
cited
in
favour
of
their
argument
and
when
they
perceived
that
they
could
not
even
thus
obtain
what
they
desired
those
who
would
appear
more
shrewd
than
others
resorted
to
this
subterfuge
that
confession
as
to
the
substance
of
it
came
from
the
divine
law
but
afterwards
derived
its
form
from
a
positive
law
in
a
similar
manner
the
most
foolish
lawyers
pretend
that
citations
originated
from
the
divine
law
because
it
is
said
adam
where
art
thou
and
exceptions
also
because
adam
answered
as
if
by
way
of
exception
the
woman
whom
thou
gavest
to
be
with
me
but
that
both
received
their
form
from
the
civil
code
but
let
us
examine
by
what
arguments
they
prove
this
confession
either
formal
or
informal
to
have
been
commanded
by
god
the
lord
say
they
sent
leprous
persons
to
the
priests
what
then
did
he
send
them
to
confession
who
ever
heard
that
the
levitical
priests
were
appointed
to
hear
confessions
therefore
they
resort
to
allegories
it
was
enacted
by
the
mosaic
law
that
the
priests
should
distinguish
between
leprosy
and
leprosy
sin
is
a
spiritual
leprosy
concerning
which
it
is
the
office
of
the
priests
to
decide
before
i
reply
to
this
i
would
inquire
by
the
way
if
this
passage
constitutes
them
judges
of
the
spiritual
leprosy
why
do
they
arrogate
to
themselves
the
cognizance
of
the
natural
and
corporeal
leprosy
is
not
this
trifling
with
the
scriptures
the
law
commits
to
the
levitical
priests
the
cognizance
of
the
leprosy
let
us
usurp
this
to
ourselves
sin
is
a
spiritual
leprosy
let
us
also
take
cognizance
of
sin
now
i
reply
the
priesthood
being
changed
there
is
made
of
necessity
a
change
also
of
the
all
the
priestly
functions
have
been
transferred
to
christ
in
him
they
are
fulfilled
and
finished
therefore
every
privilege
and
honour
of
the
sacerdotal
office
has
been
transferred
to
him
alone
if
they
are
so
extremely
fond
of
pursuing
allegories
let
them
propose
christ
to
themselves
as
the
only
priest
and
accumulate
on
his
tribunal
the
unlimited
jurisdiction
over
all
things
this
we
shall
easily
admit
besides
this
allegory
of
theirs
is
very
absurd
since
it
places
among
the
ceremonies
a
law
that
was
merely
political
why
then
does
christ
send
leprous
persons
to
the
priests
to
preclude
the
priests
from
calumniating
him
with
a
violation
of
the
law
which
commanded
him
that
was
cured
of
the
leprosy
to
show
himself
to
the
priest
and
to
be
purged
by
the
oblation
of
a
sacrifice
go
said
he
show
thyself
to
the
priest
and
offer
the
gift
that
moses
commanded
for
a
testimony
unto
and
truly
this
miracle
was
to
be
a
testimony
to
them
for
they
had
pronounced
him
leprous
now
they
pronounce
him
healed
are
they
not
whether
willingly
or
reluctantly
constrained
to
become
witnesses
of
the
miracles
of
christ
christ
gives
them
his
miracle
for
their
examination
they
can
not
deny
it
but
because
they
still
cavil
this
work
is
a
testimony
to
them
thus
it
is
said
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
all
the
world
for
a
witness
unto
all
again
ye
shall
be
brought
before
governors
and
kings
for
a
testimony
against
that
is
that
they
may
be
more
powerfully
convicted
at
the
judgment
of
god
but
if
they
would
rather
coincide
with
chrysostom
he
also
teaches
that
christ
did
this
on
account
of
the
jews
that
he
might
not
be
deemed
a
transgressor
of
the
law
though
on
a
point
so
clear
i
am
ashamed
to
adduce
the
suffrage
of
any
man
when
christ
declares
that
he
leaves
the
legal
rights
entirely
to
the
priests
as
the
professed
enemies
of
the
gospel
who
were
always
ready
to
cavil
if
their
mouths
were
not
stopped
wherefore
the
popish
priests
in
order
to
retain
this
possession
should
publicly
espouse
the
party
of
those
whom
it
is
necessary
to
restrain
by
force
from
uttering
their
curses
against
christ
for
with
this
his
true
ministers
have
no
concern
their
second
argument
they
derive
from
the
same
source
that
is
from
allegory
as
though
allegories
were
sufficient
for
the
confirmation
of
any
dogma
let
them
be
admitted
as
sufficient
if
i
do
not
prove
that
those
very
allegories
may
be
urged
by
me
with
more
plausibility
than
they
possibly
can
by
them
they
plead
therefore
that
the
lord
commanded
his
disciples
to
loose
lazarus
from
his
bandages
when
he
was
raised
from
the
grave
here
in
the
first
place
they
are
guilty
of
falsehood
for
it
is
nowhere
recorded
that
the
lord
said
this
to
his
disciples
and
it
is
much
more
probable
that
he
said
it
to
the
jews
who
were
standing
near
him
that
the
miracle
might
be
rendered
more
evident
beyond
all
suspicion
of
fraud
and
that
his
power
might
appear
the
greater
from
his
raising
the
dead
to
life
without
the
least
touch
solely
by
the
call
of
his
voice
for
i
apprehend
that
the
lord
in
order
to
remove
from
the
minds
of
the
jews
every
unfavourable
suspicion
chose
that
they
should
roll
back
the
stone
should
perceive
the
fetid
odour
should
see
the
certain
tokens
of
death
should
behold
him
rising
by
the
sole
energy
of
a
word
and
be
the
first
to
touch
him
on
his
restoration
to
life
and
this
is
the
opinion
of
chrysostom
but
admitting
this
to
have
been
addressed
to
the
disciples
what
will
they
gain
by
it
that
the
lord
gave
his
apostles
the
power
of
loosing
but
with
how
much
more
aptitude
and
skill
might
these
words
be
handled
in
an
allegorical
sense
if
we
should
say
that
god
intended
by
this
emblem
to
instruct
believers
that
they
ought
to
loose
those
whom
he
has
raised
to
life
that
is
that
they
should
not
recall
to
remembrance
the
sins
which
he
had
forgotten
that
they
should
not
condemn
as
sinners
those
whom
he
had
absolved
that
they
should
not
continue
to
upbraid
with
offences
which
he
had
forgiven
that
where
he
is
merciful
and
ready
to
spare
they
should
not
be
severe
and
rigorous
to
punish
nothing
surely
ought
to
be
a
stronger
motive
to
the
exercise
of
forgiveness
by
us
than
the
example
of
that
judge
who
threatens
to
be
implacable
towards
them
who
are
too
rigorous
and
cruel
let
them
go
now
and
boast
of
their
allegories
vi
they
come
to
a
closer
contest
when
they
oppose
us
with
what
they
apprehend
to
be
plain
passages
those
who
came
to
the
baptism
of
john
confessed
their
sins
and
james
directs
us
to
confess
our
sins
one
to
another
it
is
no
wonder
if
those
who
desired
to
be
baptized
confessed
their
sins
for
it
is
said
that
john
preached
the
baptism
of
repentance
and
baptized
with
water
unto
whom
then
should
he
baptize
but
such
as
confessed
themselves
sinners
baptism
is
an
emblem
of
remission
of
sins
and
who
should
be
admitted
to
this
emblem
but
sinners
and
those
who
acknowledged
themselves
to
be
such
they
confessed
their
sins
therefore
in
order
to
be
baptized
nor
is
it
without
reason
that
james
directs
us
to
confess
one
to
another
but
if
they
would
observe
what
immediately
follows
they
would
perceive
that
this
also
affords
them
very
little
support
confess
says
he
your
faults
one
to
another
and
pray
for
one
he
connects
mutual
confession
and
mutual
prayer
if
our
confessions
must
be
made
only
to
priests
then
our
prayers
ought
to
be
offered
up
for
them
alone
but
would
it
not
follow
from
the
language
of
james
that
priests
alone
might
make
confessions
for
when
he
enjoins
mutual
confession
he
addresses
such
only
as
have
a
right
to
hear
the
confessions
of
others
αλληλοι
implies
mutually
by
turns
successively
or
reciprocally
but
none
can
reciprocally
confess
but
those
who
are
qualified
to
hear
confessions
and
since
they
dignify
the
priests
exclusively
with
this
prerogative
we
also
relinquish
to
them
alone
the
task
of
making
confession
then
let
us
dismiss
such
impertinences
and
attend
to
the
real
meaning
of
the
apostle
which
is
simple
and
clear
it
is
that
we
should
reciprocally
communicate
our
infirmities
to
each
other
to
receive
from
one
another
mutual
advice
mutual
compassion
and
mutual
consolation
and
also
that
being
mutually
conscious
of
the
infirmities
of
our
brethren
we
should
pray
to
the
lord
on
their
behalf
why
then
do
they
quote
james
in
opposition
to
us
when
we
so
strongly
urge
a
confession
of
the
divine
mercy
but
no
man
can
confess
the
mercy
of
god
if
he
has
not
previously
confessed
his
own
misery
indeed
we
rather
pronounce
an
anathema
against
him
who
has
not
confessed
himself
a
sinner
before
god
before
his
angels
before
the
church
and
in
a
word
before
all
mankind
for
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
every
mouth
may
be
stopped
and
all
the
world
may
become
guilty
before
god
and
that
he
alone
may
be
justified
and
exalted
vii
but
i
wonder
with
what
face
they
can
presume
to
contend
that
the
confession
of
which
they
speak
is
of
divine
appointment
the
practice
we
admit
to
be
very
ancient
but
we
can
easily
prove
that
christians
were
formerly
quite
at
liberty
as
to
the
use
of
it
that
there
was
no
fixed
law
or
constitution
respecting
it
till
the
time
of
innocent
is
certain
from
the
testimony
of
their
own
histories
surely
if
there
had
been
a
more
ancient
law
they
would
rather
have
cited
it
than
by
being
content
with
a
decree
of
the
council
of
lateran
have
rendered
themselves
ridiculous
even
in
the
eyes
of
children
they
hesitate
not
in
other
cases
to
fabricate
fictitious
decrees
which
they
ascribe
to
the
most
ancient
councils
that
they
may
dazzle
the
eyes
of
the
simple
by
a
veneration
for
antiquity
in
this
instance
they
never
thought
of
obtruding
such
a
forgery
therefore
according
to
their
own
testimony
three
hundred
years
have
not
yet
elapsed
since
innocent
iii
introduced
the
snare
and
imposed
the
necessity
of
confession
but
to
say
nothing
respecting
the
time
the
barbarism
of
the
diction
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
deprive
that
law
of
all
credit
for
the
good
fathers
enjoin
that
every
person
of
both
sexes
shall
once
in
every
year
make
a
particular
confession
of
all
sins
to
the
proper
priest
but
some
wits
facetiously
object
that
this
precept
binds
none
but
hermaphrodites
and
relates
to
no
one
who
is
either
a
male
or
a
female
moreover
their
disciples
have
betrayed
still
greater
folly
in
their
inability
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
the
proper
priest
whatever
may
be
clamorously
pretended
by
all
the
pope
s
mercenary
disputants
we
are
certain
that
christ
was
not
the
author
of
this
law
which
compels
men
to
enumerate
their
sins
and
that
twelve
centuries
passed
away
after
the
resurrection
of
christ
before
any
such
law
was
promulgated
so
that
this
tyranny
was
not
introduced
till
after
the
extinction
of
piety
and
learning
when
masques
occupying
the
place
of
pastors
had
assumed
an
unlimited
license
of
doing
whatever
they
pleased
there
are
also
plain
testimonies
in
histories
and
other
ancient
writings
which
inform
us
that
this
was
a
political
discipline
instituted
by
bishops
not
a
law
given
by
christ
or
his
apostles
of
a
great
number
i
shall
produce
only
one
which
will
be
a
clear
proof
of
this
assertion
sozomen
in
his
ecclesiastical
history
relates
that
this
ordinance
of
the
bishops
was
diligently
observed
in
all
the
western
churches
and
especially
at
rome
he
fully
implies
that
it
was
not
the
universal
custom
of
all
the
churches
and
says
that
one
of
the
presbyters
was
peculiarly
appointed
to
this
office
in
this
he
abundantly
confutes
the
false
pretensions
of
these
men
that
the
keys
were
given
promiscuously
for
this
use
to
the
whole
sacerdotal
order
since
it
was
not
the
common
function
of
all
priests
but
the
peculiar
department
of
one
who
was
chosen
to
it
by
the
bishop
this
is
the
same
who
in
the
present
day
in
every
cathedral
church
is
called
the
penitentiary
who
takes
cognizance
of
crimes
of
peculiar
enormity
and
such
as
are
censured
for
the
sake
of
example
the
historian
immediately
adds
that
this
was
the
custom
also
at
constantinople
till
a
certain
matron
pretending
to
go
to
confession
was
discovered
to
have
concealed
under
this
specious
pretext
a
criminal
connection
with
the
deacon
of
that
church
on
account
of
this
crime
nectarius
the
bishop
of
the
church
a
man
eminent
for
sanctity
and
erudition
abolished
the
ceremony
of
confession
here
let
them
erect
their
asinine
ears
if
auricular
confession
had
been
a
law
of
god
how
could
nectarius
have
presumed
to
reverse
and
disannul
it
will
they
accuse
nectarius
of
heresy
and
schism
who
is
acknowledged
by
all
the
fathers
to
have
been
a
holy
man
of
god
but
the
same
sentence
would
condemn
the
constantinopolitan
church
in
which
sozomen
affirms
the
custom
of
confession
not
only
to
have
been
discontinued
for
a
season
but
to
have
been
altogether
disused
down
to
his
time
and
they
would
accuse
of
apostasy
not
only
the
church
of
constantinople
but
all
the
oriental
churches
who
neglected
a
law
which
they
maintain
to
be
inviolable
and
obligatory
on
all
christians
viii
but
this
abrogation
is
plainly
attested
by
chrysostom
who
was
himself
also
a
bishop
of
the
church
of
constantinople
in
so
many
places
that
it
is
surprising
how
they
dare
to
open
their
mouths
in
contradiction
of
it
confess
your
sins
says
he
that
you
may
obliterate
them
if
you
are
ashamed
to
tell
any
one
what
sins
you
have
committed
confess
them
daily
in
your
soul
i
say
not
that
you
should
confess
them
to
your
who
may
reproach
you
confess
them
to
god
who
cures
them
confess
your
sins
on
your
bed
that
there
your
conscience
may
daily
recognize
its
again
but
now
it
is
not
necessary
to
confess
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
let
an
inquisition
into
your
transgressions
be
the
work
of
your
own
thoughts
let
there
be
no
witness
of
this
judgment
let
god
alone
see
you
again
i
conduct
you
not
into
the
public
view
of
your
i
do
not
oblige
you
to
reveal
your
sins
to
men
lay
open
your
conscience
in
the
presence
of
god
show
your
wounds
to
the
lord
who
is
the
best
physician
and
implore
a
remedy
from
him
show
them
to
him
who
upbraideth
not
but
most
mercifully
again
you
certainly
should
not
tell
it
to
a
man
lest
he
reproach
you
nor
is
confession
to
be
made
to
a
who
may
publish
it
but
show
your
wounds
to
the
lord
who
exercises
his
care
over
you
and
is
a
most
merciful
he
afterwards
introduces
god
speaking
thus
i
constrain
you
not
to
come
forth
into
the
midst
of
a
theatre
and
assemble
a
multitude
of
witnesses
declare
your
sin
privately
to
me
alone
that
i
may
heal
your
shall
we
say
that
chrysostom
proceeded
to
such
a
degree
of
temerity
when
he
wrote
those
and
similar
passages
as
to
liberate
the
consciences
of
men
from
obligations
imposed
on
them
by
the
divine
law
certainly
not
but
he
dares
not
to
require
as
necessary
what
he
knows
is
never
prescribed
in
the
word
of
god
ix
but
to
place
the
whole
subject
in
a
more
plain
and
familiar
light
we
will
first
faithfully
state
what
kind
of
confession
is
taught
in
the
word
of
god
and
then
we
will
subjoin
an
account
of
those
inventions
of
the
papists
not
indeed
of
all
for
who
could
exhaust
that
immense
ocean
but
only
of
those
which
comprise
the
substance
of
their
doctrine
respecting
secret
confession
here
it
grieves
me
to
mention
how
frequently
the
old
translator
has
translated
confess
instead
of
praise
which
is
well
known
even
to
the
most
unlearned
only
it
is
necessary
to
expose
their
audacity
in
transferring
to
their
own
tyrannical
edict
what
was
written
with
reference
to
the
praises
of
god
to
prove
the
virtue
of
confession
to
exhilarate
the
mind
they
produce
this
passage
from
the
psalmist
with
the
voice
of
exultation
and
but
if
such
a
metamorphosis
of
the
passage
be
admitted
we
shall
be
able
to
infer
any
thing
from
any
thing
but
since
they
are
thus
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
let
the
pious
reader
remember
that
they
have
been
consigned
over
to
a
reprobate
mind
by
the
righteous
vengeance
of
god
to
render
their
presumption
the
more
detestable
if
we
are
satisfied
with
the
simple
doctrine
of
the
scripture
we
shall
be
in
no
danger
of
being
deluded
by
such
fallacies
for
there
one
method
of
confession
is
prescribed
which
is
that
since
it
is
the
lord
who
forgives
forgets
and
obliterates
sins
we
should
confess
our
sins
to
him
that
we
may
obtain
pardon
he
is
a
physician
to
him
then
let
us
discover
our
wounds
he
is
injured
and
offended
let
us
pray
to
him
for
peace
he
is
the
searcher
of
hearts
and
privy
to
all
thoughts
let
us
hasten
to
pour
out
our
hearts
before
him
finally
it
is
he
who
calls
sinners
let
us
not
delay
to
approach
him
david
says
i
acknowledge
my
sin
unto
thee
and
mine
iniquity
have
i
not
hid
i
said
i
will
confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
similar
to
this
is
another
confession
of
david
have
mercy
upon
me
o
god
according
unto
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
such
also
is
the
confession
of
daniel
we
have
sinned
and
have
committed
iniquity
and
have
done
wickedly
and
have
rebelled
even
by
departing
from
thy
and
such
are
the
other
confessions
which
frequently
occur
in
the
scriptures
the
recital
of
which
would
almost
fill
a
volume
john
says
if
we
confess
our
sins
god
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
to
whom
must
we
confess
to
him
certainly
and
this
we
do
if
we
prostrate
ourselves
before
him
with
a
distressed
and
humbled
heart
if
we
sincerely
accuse
and
condemn
ourselves
in
his
presence
and
pray
to
be
pardoned
by
his
goodness
and
mercy
whoever
from
the
heart
makes
this
confession
before
god
will
also
without
doubt
have
a
tongue
prepared
for
confession
as
often
as
it
shall
be
necessary
to
proclaim
the
divine
mercy
among
men
and
not
only
to
whisper
the
secret
of
his
mind
once
into
the
ear
of
an
individual
but
frequently
and
publicly
and
in
the
hearing
of
the
whole
world
ingenuously
to
declare
both
his
own
ignominy
and
the
magnificence
and
glory
of
god
in
this
manner
when
david
was
reproved
by
nathan
he
felt
compunction
of
conscience
and
confessed
his
sin
both
to
god
and
to
men
i
have
sinned
said
he
against
the
lord
that
is
i
now
make
no
excuse
nor
use
the
least
subterfuge
to
prevent
all
men
from
condemning
me
as
a
sinner
and
what
i
wished
to
conceal
from
the
lord
from
being
revealed
also
to
men
the
secret
confession
therefore
which
is
made
to
god
is
followed
by
a
voluntary
confession
before
men
whenever
it
contributes
either
to
the
divine
glory
or
to
our
humiliation
for
this
reason
the
lord
anciently
enjoined
upon
the
israelites
that
all
the
people
should
confess
their
iniquities
publicly
in
the
temple
by
the
mouth
of
the
priest
for
he
foresaw
this
assistance
to
be
necessary
for
them
to
bring
every
person
to
a
proper
view
of
himself
and
it
is
reasonable
that
by
the
confession
of
our
misery
we
should
glorify
the
goodness
and
mercy
of
god
both
among
ourselves
and
before
the
whole
world
xi
this
kind
of
confession
ought
to
be
both
ordinary
in
the
church
and
extraordinary
to
be
practised
in
a
particular
manner
whenever
the
people
at
large
are
chargeable
with
the
guilt
of
any
common
crime
we
have
an
example
of
the
latter
in
that
solemn
confession
which
was
made
by
all
the
people
under
the
auspices
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
for
as
their
long
exile
the
destruction
of
their
city
and
temple
and
the
subversion
of
their
religion
were
punishments
of
the
common
defection
of
all
they
could
not
properly
acknowledge
the
blessing
of
deliverance
unless
they
had
first
confessed
their
guilt
nor
is
it
of
any
importance
if
in
a
congregation
there
be
sometimes
a
few
innocent
persons
for
as
they
are
members
of
a
languid
and
diseased
body
they
ought
not
to
boast
of
health
nor
is
it
possible
indeed
but
they
must
contract
some
of
the
pollution
and
sustain
part
of
the
guilt
therefore
whenever
we
are
afflicted
with
pestilence
or
war
or
sterility
or
any
other
calamity
if
it
be
our
duty
to
resort
to
mourning
to
fasting
and
other
expressions
of
guilt
itself
on
which
all
these
other
things
depend
ought
by
no
means
to
be
neglected
the
ordinary
confession
is
not
only
recommended
from
the
mouth
of
the
lord
but
no
judicious
man
who
has
considered
its
usefulness
will
venture
to
condemn
it
for
since
in
every
religious
assembly
we
introduce
ourselves
into
the
presence
of
god
and
angels
how
shall
we
commence
our
services
except
by
an
acknowledgment
of
our
unworthiness
but
this
you
will
say
is
done
in
every
prayer
for
whenever
we
pray
for
pardon
we
make
a
confession
of
our
sins
this
i
acknowledge
but
if
you
consider
our
extreme
carelessness
or
drowsiness
or
stupidity
you
will
admit
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
salutary
regulation
if
the
generality
of
christians
were
accustomed
to
humble
themselves
by
some
solemn
act
of
confession
for
though
the
ceremony
which
the
lord
enjoined
on
the
israelites
was
a
part
of
the
tutelage
of
the
law
yet
the
thing
itself
in
some
measure
belongs
also
to
us
and
indeed
we
see
that
in
all
churches
this
custom
is
advantageously
observed
that
on
every
lord
s
day
the
minister
makes
a
formal
confession
in
which
he
represents
all
as
guilty
of
sin
and
supplicates
pardon
from
the
lord
on
behalf
of
all
finally
by
this
key
the
gate
of
prayer
is
opened
both
to
individuals
in
private
and
in
public
to
all
the
congregation
xii
moreover
the
scripture
sanctions
two
kinds
of
private
confession
one
to
be
made
for
our
own
sake
which
is
referred
to
in
the
direction
of
james
that
we
should
confess
our
faults
one
to
another
for
he
means
that
revealing
our
infirmities
to
one
another
we
should
assist
each
other
with
mutual
advice
and
consolation
another
which
is
to
be
made
for
the
sake
of
our
neighbour
to
pacify
and
reconcile
him
to
us
if
we
have
done
him
any
injury
in
the
former
species
of
confession
though
james
by
not
expressly
appointing
any
one
into
whose
bosom
we
should
disburden
ourselves
leaves
us
quite
at
liberty
to
confess
to
any
member
of
the
church
who
shall
appear
most
suitable
yet
since
the
pastors
must
generally
be
considered
more
proper
than
others
we
ought
chiefly
to
make
choice
of
them
i
say
that
they
are
more
suitable
than
others
since
in
their
very
vocation
to
the
ministry
they
are
designated
by
the
lord
to
instruct
us
to
subdue
and
correct
our
sins
and
to
console
us
with
a
confidence
of
pardon
for
though
the
office
of
mutual
admonition
and
reproof
is
committed
to
all
yet
it
is
especially
confided
to
ministers
and
so
while
we
all
ought
mutually
to
console
and
confirm
each
other
in
a
confidence
of
the
divine
mercy
yet
we
see
that
ministers
are
constituted
witnesses
and
sureties
of
it
that
they
may
afford
our
consciences
a
stronger
assurance
of
the
remission
of
sins
insomuch
that
they
themselves
are
said
to
remit
sins
and
to
loose
souls
when
you
find
this
attributed
to
them
consider
that
it
is
for
your
benefit
therefore
let
every
believer
remember
that
it
is
his
duty
if
he
feels
such
secret
anguish
or
affliction
from
a
sense
of
his
sins
that
he
can
not
extricate
himself
without
some
exterior
aid
not
to
neglect
the
remedy
offered
him
by
the
lord
which
is
that
in
order
to
alleviate
his
distress
he
should
use
private
confession
with
his
pastor
and
to
obtain
consolation
should
privately
implore
his
assistance
whose
office
it
is
both
publicly
and
privately
to
comfort
the
people
of
god
with
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
but
we
should
always
observe
such
a
degree
of
moderation
as
to
lay
no
yoke
on
the
conscience
where
god
has
given
no
positive
command
hence
it
follows
that
such
confession
ought
to
be
free
so
as
not
to
be
required
of
all
but
only
to
be
recommended
to
those
who
conceive
themselves
to
need
it
it
follows
also
that
they
who
practise
it
on
account
of
their
need
of
it
should
neither
be
compelled
by
any
precept
nor
be
induced
by
any
artifice
to
enumerate
all
their
sins
but
only
so
far
as
they
shall
think
beneficial
to
themselves
that
they
may
receive
solid
consolation
faithful
pastors
ought
not
only
to
leave
the
churches
in
possession
of
this
liberty
but
also
to
defend
and
vindicate
it
with
all
their
power
if
they
wish
to
preserve
their
ministry
from
tyranny
and
the
people
from
superstition
xiii
concerning
the
other
species
of
confession
christ
says
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
if
thou
bring
thy
gift
to
the
altar
and
there
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hath
ought
against
thee
leave
there
thy
gift
before
the
altar
and
go
thy
way
first
be
reconciled
to
thy
brother
and
then
come
and
offer
thy
thus
is
that
charity
which
has
been
broken
by
our
offence
to
be
repaired
by
acknowledging
the
fault
we
have
committed
and
imploring
forgiveness
in
this
kind
is
comprehended
the
confession
of
those
who
have
sinned
to
the
offence
of
the
whole
church
for
if
christ
esteems
the
private
offence
of
one
man
of
such
importance
as
to
prohibit
from
the
sacred
ordinances
all
those
who
have
sinned
against
their
brethren
till
they
have
been
restored
to
favour
by
an
adequate
satisfaction
much
stronger
is
the
reason
that
he
who
by
any
evil
example
has
injured
the
whole
church
should
reconcile
it
to
himself
by
an
acknowledgment
of
his
guilt
thus
was
the
corinthian
readmitted
to
the
communion
after
having
submitted
to
reproof
this
mode
of
confession
is
stated
by
cyprian
to
have
been
practised
in
the
ancient
church
they
repent
says
he
in
due
time
and
afterwards
they
come
to
confession
and
by
the
imposition
of
the
hands
of
the
bishop
and
clergy
they
receive
a
right
to
the
scripture
knows
nothing
of
any
other
method
or
form
of
confession
and
it
is
not
our
province
to
impose
new
chains
on
men
s
consciences
which
christ
most
strictly
forbids
to
reduce
under
the
yoke
of
bondage
but
that
the
sheep
should
present
themselves
to
their
pastor
whenever
they
desire
to
partake
of
the
sacred
supper
i
am
so
far
from
opposing
that
i
earnestly
wish
it
were
universally
observed
for
those
who
experience
distress
of
conscience
may
receive
singular
benefit
from
such
an
interview
and
those
who
require
to
be
admonished
will
thus
afford
an
opportunity
for
admonitions
provided
that
care
be
always
taken
to
guard
against
tyranny
and
superstition
xiv
the
power
of
the
keys
is
exercised
in
these
three
kinds
of
confession
either
when
the
whole
church
implores
pardon
by
a
solemn
acknowledgment
of
its
transgressions
or
when
an
individual
who
by
any
remarkable
crime
has
occasioned
a
common
offence
declares
his
repentance
or
when
he
who
needs
the
assistance
of
the
minister
on
account
of
the
disquietude
of
his
conscience
discloses
his
infirmity
to
him
the
removal
of
an
offence
proceeds
on
a
different
principle
because
though
it
is
also
designed
to
produce
peace
of
conscience
yet
the
principal
end
is
that
animosity
may
be
destroyed
and
the
minds
of
men
united
in
the
bonds
of
peace
but
this
advantage
which
i
have
mentioned
is
by
no
means
to
be
despised
that
we
may
confess
our
sins
with
the
greater
readiness
for
when
the
whole
church
stands
as
it
were
before
the
tribunal
of
god
when
they
confess
themselves
guilty
and
have
no
refuge
but
in
the
divine
mercy
is
no
mean
or
trivial
consolation
to
have
christ
s
ambassador
present
furnished
with
the
mandate
of
reconciliation
by
whom
they
may
have
their
absolution
pronounced
here
the
usefulness
of
the
keys
is
deservedly
celebrated
when
this
embassy
is
rightly
performed
with
becoming
order
and
reverence
so
when
he
who
had
in
some
measure
alienated
himself
from
the
church
is
pardoned
and
restored
to
the
unity
of
the
brethren
how
great
a
blessing
does
he
experience
in
knowing
himself
to
be
forgiven
by
them
to
whom
christ
has
said
whose
soever
sins
ye
shall
remit
on
earth
they
shall
be
remitted
in
heaven
nor
is
private
absolution
less
efficacious
or
beneficial
when
it
is
requested
by
those
who
need
a
particular
remedy
for
the
relief
of
their
infirmities
for
it
frequently
happens
that
he
who
hears
the
general
promises
which
are
addressed
to
the
whole
congregation
of
believers
nevertheless
remains
in
some
suspense
and
his
mind
is
still
disquieted
with
doubts
of
the
forgiveness
of
his
sins
the
same
person
if
he
discloses
to
his
pastor
the
secret
distress
of
his
mind
and
hears
this
language
of
the
gospel
particularly
directed
to
him
be
of
good
cheer
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
will
encourage
his
mind
to
an
assurance
and
will
be
liberated
from
that
trepidation
with
which
he
was
before
disturbed
but
when
we
are
treating
of
the
keys
we
must
always
be
cautious
not
to
dream
of
any
power
distinct
from
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
this
subject
will
again
be
discussed
more
fully
in
another
place
where
we
shall
have
to
treat
of
the
government
of
the
church
and
there
we
shall
see
that
all
the
power
of
binding
and
loosing
which
christ
has
conferred
on
the
church
is
inseparable
from
the
word
but
this
is
chiefly
applicable
to
the
ministry
of
the
keys
the
whole
force
and
meaning
of
which
consist
in
this
that
the
grace
of
the
gospel
should
be
confirmed
and
sealed
as
it
were
to
the
minds
of
the
faithful
in
public
as
well
as
private
by
those
whom
the
lord
has
ordained
to
this
office
which
can
not
be
done
but
by
preaching
alone
xv
but
what
is
the
doctrine
of
the
romish
divines
they
maintain
that
all
persons
of
both
sexes
as
soon
as
they
shall
have
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
should
once
at
least
in
every
year
confess
all
their
sins
to
their
own
priest
that
there
is
no
remission
of
sin
unless
they
have
firmly
resolved
to
confess
it
that
unless
they
fulfil
this
resolution
when
opportunity
offers
there
is
no
admittance
for
them
into
paradise
and
moreover
that
the
priest
has
the
power
of
the
keys
with
which
he
may
loose
the
sinner
or
bind
him
because
christ
has
not
said
in
vain
whatsoever
ye
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
in
but
concerning
this
power
they
have
obstinate
contentions
among
themselves
some
say
that
there
is
essentially
but
one
key
namely
the
power
of
binding
and
loosing
that
knowledge
is
required
indeed
for
the
good
use
of
it
but
that
it
is
only
like
an
accessory
not
an
essential
concomitant
others
perceiving
this
to
be
too
unlimited
a
license
have
mentioned
two
keys
discretion
and
power
others
again
observing
that
the
wickedness
of
the
priests
was
restrained
by
such
moderation
have
invented
other
keys
an
authority
of
discerning
which
they
might
use
in
pronouncing
decisions
and
a
power
which
they
might
exert
in
executing
their
sentences
with
knowledge
to
assist
as
a
counsellor
but
they
venture
not
to
explain
this
binding
and
loosing
simply
to
mean
forgiving
and
obliterating
sins
because
they
hear
the
lord
proclaiming
by
the
prophet
i
am
the
lord
and
beside
me
there
is
no
saviour
i
even
i
am
he
which
blotteth
out
thy
but
they
say
that
it
belongs
to
the
priest
to
pronounce
who
are
bound
or
loosed
and
to
declare
whose
sins
are
remitted
or
retained
and
that
he
declares
it
either
by
confession
when
he
absolves
and
retains
sins
or
by
his
sentence
when
he
excommunicates
and
when
he
receives
to
the
communion
of
the
sacraments
lastly
when
they
perceive
that
they
are
not
yet
extricated
from
this
difficulty
but
that
it
may
always
be
objected
that
their
priests
frequently
bind
and
loose
improper
persons
who
are
not
therefore
bound
or
loosed
in
heaven
their
last
resource
they
reply
that
the
commission
of
the
keys
must
be
understood
with
some
limitation
christ
having
promised
that
the
sentence
of
the
priest
which
has
been
justly
delivered
according
to
the
merits
of
the
persons
bound
or
loosed
shall
be
confirmed
at
his
tribunal
they
add
also
that
these
keys
were
given
by
christ
to
all
priests
who
receive
them
from
the
bishops
on
their
promotion
to
the
sacerdotal
office
but
that
the
free
use
of
them
belongs
only
to
those
who
exercise
ecclesiastical
functions
that
the
keys
themselves
remain
indeed
with
the
excommunicated
or
suspended
ones
but
that
they
are
rusty
and
disused
and
those
who
advance
these
things
may
justly
be
considered
modest
and
sober
in
comparison
with
others
who
on
a
new
anvil
have
fabricated
new
keys
with
which
they
tell
us
the
treasure
of
the
church
is
locked
up
which
we
shall
examine
in
the
proper
place
xvi
i
shall
briefly
reply
to
each
of
these
things
though
without
noticing
at
present
the
justice
or
injustice
with
which
they
bind
the
souls
of
the
faithful
by
their
laws
as
that
will
be
considered
in
due
order
but
when
they
impose
a
law
respecting
the
enumeration
of
all
sins
when
they
deny
that
sin
is
forgiven
but
on
condition
that
a
firm
resolution
has
been
formed
to
confess
it
when
they
say
that
there
remains
no
entrance
into
paradise
if
the
opportunity
of
confession
has
been
neglected
is
altogether
intolerable
must
all
sins
be
enumerated
david
who
i
suppose
had
often
meditated
the
confession
of
his
sins
nevertheless
exclaimed
who
can
understand
his
errors
cleanse
thou
me
from
secret
and
in
another
place
mine
iniquities
are
gone
over
mine
head
as
a
heavy
burden
they
are
too
heavy
for
he
had
just
apprehensions
of
the
vast
abyss
of
our
sins
of
the
numerous
species
of
our
crimes
of
the
many
heads
this
monster
bore
and
the
long
tail
it
drew
after
it
therefore
he
attempted
not
to
detail
his
transgressions
but
from
the
abyss
of
his
distresses
cried
to
the
lord
i
am
afflicted
and
ready
to
die
my
spirit
is
overwhelmed
within
me
i
dwell
in
darkness
as
those
that
have
been
long
dead
the
sorrows
of
death
compassed
me
and
the
pains
of
hell
gat
hold
upon
me
i
sink
in
deep
mire
deliver
me
out
of
the
mire
and
let
me
not
who
can
now
think
of
recounting
his
sins
when
he
sees
that
david
was
unable
to
enter
on
an
enumeration
of
his
xvii
the
souls
of
those
who
have
been
affected
with
any
discoveries
of
god
have
been
most
cruelly
tormented
by
this
fatal
delusion
first
they
called
themselves
to
an
account
they
divided
sins
into
boughs
branches
twigs
and
leaves
according
to
the
distinctions
of
these
confessors
then
they
examined
the
qualities
quantities
and
circumstances
and
the
business
made
some
little
progress
but
when
they
had
advanced
further
they
were
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
sea
and
the
sky
no
port
no
haven
in
prospect
the
more
they
had
passed
over
the
greater
mass
was
always
accumulating
on
their
view
they
beheld
as
it
were
lofty
mountains
rising
before
them
and
no
time
or
labour
seemed
to
encourage
the
least
hope
of
escaping
thus
they
remained
in
extreme
distress
and
after
all
found
it
terminate
in
nothing
but
despair
then
the
remedy
applied
by
those
cruel
murderers
to
alleviate
the
wounds
which
they
had
made
was
that
every
one
should
do
to
the
uttermost
of
his
ability
but
new
cares
again
disturbed
and
new
agonies
again
excruciated
these
miserable
souls
i
have
not
devoted
sufficient
time
i
have
not
applied
with
proper
diligence
i
have
omitted
many
things
through
negligence
and
the
forgetfulness
which
arises
from
negligence
is
inexcusable
to
assuage
such
pains
other
remedies
were
now
added
repent
of
your
negligence
if
it
be
not
too
great
it
will
be
forgiven
but
all
these
things
can
not
heal
the
wound
nor
do
they
act
as
alleviations
of
the
malady
but
rather
as
poisons
concealed
in
honey
that
they
may
not
by
their
harshness
offend
at
the
first
taste
but
may
penetrate
into
the
inmost
parts
before
they
are
perceived
this
terrible
injunction
therefore
is
always
pursuing
them
and
resounding
in
their
ears
confess
all
your
sins
nor
can
that
terror
be
appeased
but
by
some
certain
consolation
here
let
the
reader
consider
the
possibility
of
taking
an
account
of
the
actions
of
a
whole
year
and
selecting
the
sins
of
every
day
since
experience
convinces
every
man
that
when
at
evening
he
comes
to
examine
the
delinquencies
of
only
one
day
his
memory
is
confounded
by
their
great
multitude
and
variety
i
speak
not
of
stupid
hypocrites
who
if
they
have
noticed
three
or
four
gross
sins
imagine
they
have
discharged
their
duty
but
of
the
true
worshippers
of
god
who
when
they
find
themselves
overwhelmed
with
the
examination
they
have
made
conclude
in
the
language
of
john
if
our
heart
condemn
us
god
is
greater
than
our
they
tremble
therefore
before
that
judge
whose
knowledge
far
exceeds
our
apprehension
xviii
the
acquiescence
of
a
great
part
of
the
world
in
such
soothing
arts
employed
to
temper
this
mortal
poison
was
not
indulged
from
a
belief
that
god
was
satisfied
or
because
they
were
altogether
satisfied
themselves
but
that
like
mariners
having
cast
anchor
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
they
might
enjoy
a
short
respite
from
the
toils
of
navigation
or
like
a
fatigued
and
fainting
traveller
might
lie
down
in
the
road
i
shall
not
take
much
trouble
to
establish
this
point
for
every
man
may
be
his
own
witness
of
it
i
will
briefly
state
the
nature
of
this
law
first
it
is
absolutely
impracticable
therefore
it
can
only
destroy
condemn
confound
and
precipitate
into
ruin
and
despair
in
the
next
place
it
diverts
sinners
from
a
true
sense
of
their
sins
and
makes
them
hypocrites
ignorant
both
of
god
and
themselves
for
while
they
are
wholly
employed
in
enumerating
their
sins
they
forget
in
the
mean
time
that
latent
source
of
vices
their
secret
iniquities
and
inward
pollutions
a
knowledge
of
which
is
above
all
things
necessary
to
a
consideration
of
their
misery
but
the
most
certain
rule
of
confession
is
to
acknowledge
and
confess
the
abyss
of
our
guilt
to
be
vast
beyond
all
our
comprehension
the
publican
s
confession
appears
to
have
been
composed
according
to
this
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
as
though
he
had
said
all
that
i
am
is
utterly
sinful
i
can
not
reach
the
magnitude
of
my
sins
either
with
my
tongue
or
with
my
mind
let
the
abyss
of
thy
mercy
swallow
up
this
abyss
of
but
you
will
say
are
not
particular
sins
then
to
be
confessed
is
no
confession
accepted
by
god
unless
it
be
comprised
in
these
precise
words
i
am
a
sinner
i
reply
that
we
should
rather
endeavour
as
far
as
we
possibly
can
to
pour
out
our
whole
heart
before
the
lord
and
not
only
confess
ourselves
sinners
in
a
single
expression
but
truly
and
cordially
acknowledge
ourselves
such
and
consider
in
all
our
reflections
how
great
and
various
is
the
pollution
of
sin
not
only
that
we
are
unclean
but
the
nature
and
extent
of
our
impurity
not
only
that
we
are
debtors
but
the
magnitude
and
number
of
the
debts
with
which
we
are
burdened
not
only
that
we
are
wounded
but
what
a
multitude
of
mortal
wounds
we
have
received
yet
when
the
sinner
has
wholly
unbosomed
himself
before
god
in
this
acknowledgment
let
him
seriously
and
sincerely
reflect
that
more
sins
still
remain
and
that
the
secret
recesses
of
his
guilt
are
too
deep
to
be
entirely
disclosed
and
therefore
let
him
exclaim
with
david
who
can
understand
his
errors
cleanse
thou
me
from
secret
now
when
they
affirm
that
sins
are
not
forgiven
without
a
strong
resolution
having
been
formed
to
confess
them
and
that
the
gate
of
paradise
is
shut
against
him
who
has
neglected
an
opportunity
afforded
him
of
confessing
be
it
from
us
to
make
them
such
a
concession
for
there
is
no
other
remission
of
sins
now
than
there
always
has
been
among
all
those
who
are
said
to
have
obtained
remission
of
sins
from
christ
none
are
said
to
have
made
a
confession
in
the
ear
of
any
priest
nor
indeed
was
it
possible
for
them
thus
to
confess
when
there
were
no
confessionary
priests
and
confession
itself
was
altogether
unknown
and
this
confession
was
unheard
of
for
many
ages
after
during
which
sins
were
forgiven
without
this
condition
but
not
to
debate
any
longer
as
respecting
a
doubtful
point
the
word
of
god
which
abideth
for
ever
is
perfectly
clear
if
the
wicked
will
turn
from
all
his
sins
all
his
transgressions
that
he
hath
committed
they
shall
not
be
mentioned
unto
he
who
presumes
to
make
any
addition
to
this
declaration
does
not
bind
sins
but
limits
the
mercy
of
god
when
they
contend
that
judgment
can
not
be
given
without
a
trial
of
the
cause
we
are
prepared
with
an
they
are
guilty
of
arrogant
presumption
in
creating
themselves
judges
and
it
is
surprising
that
they
so
securely
fabricate
principles
for
themselves
which
no
man
of
sound
understanding
will
admit
they
boast
that
the
office
of
binding
and
loosing
is
committed
to
them
as
though
it
were
a
kind
of
jurisdiction
annexed
to
examination
that
the
apostles
were
strangers
to
this
authority
their
whole
doctrine
proclaims
and
to
know
certainly
whether
the
sinner
be
loosed
belongs
not
to
the
priest
but
to
him
of
whom
absolution
is
implored
since
the
priest
who
bears
the
confession
can
never
know
whether
the
enumeration
of
sins
be
true
and
perfect
thus
there
would
be
no
absolution
but
what
must
be
restricted
to
the
words
of
the
person
to
be
judged
besides
the
loosing
of
sins
depends
entirely
on
faith
and
repentance
which
both
elude
the
knowledge
of
man
when
sentence
is
to
be
given
respecting
another
it
follows
therefore
that
the
certainty
of
binding
and
loosing
is
not
subject
to
the
decision
of
an
earthly
judge
because
a
minister
in
the
legitimate
execution
of
his
office
can
pronounce
only
a
conditional
absolution
but
that
the
declaration
soever
sins
ye
remit
they
are
is
spoken
for
the
sake
of
sinners
to
preclude
every
doubt
that
the
pardon
which
is
promised
according
to
the
command
and
word
of
god
will
be
ratified
in
heaven
xix
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
if
we
condemn
and
desire
the
total
removal
of
this
auricular
thing
so
pestilent
and
in
so
many
respects
injurious
to
the
church
even
if
it
were
a
thing
abstractedly
indifferent
yet
since
it
is
of
no
use
or
benefit
but
has
occasioned
so
much
impiety
sacrilege
and
error
can
refuse
to
admit
that
it
ought
to
be
immediately
abolished
they
mention
indeed
some
uses
which
they
boast
of
as
very
beneficial
but
these
are
mere
fictions
or
productive
of
no
advantage
whatever
one
circumstance
they
state
as
a
peculiar
recommendation
that
the
shame
of
the
person
who
confesses
is
a
grievous
punishment
by
which
the
sinner
is
rendered
more
cautious
in
future
and
prevents
the
vengeance
of
god
by
punishing
himself
as
though
we
humble
not
a
man
with
a
sufficient
degree
of
shame
when
we
summon
him
to
the
supreme
tribunal
of
the
cognizance
of
god
it
is
a
wonderful
advantage
indeed
if
we
cease
to
sin
through
a
shame
of
one
man
but
are
never
ashamed
of
having
god
for
a
witness
of
our
evil
conscience
though
this
very
notion
is
utterly
false
for
it
is
universally
observable
that
nothing
produces
a
greater
confidence
or
licentiousness
in
sinning
than
the
idea
entertained
by
some
men
after
they
have
made
their
confession
to
a
priest
that
they
may
wipe
their
mouth
and
say
i
have
done
no
and
they
not
only
become
more
presumptuous
in
their
sins
throughout
the
year
but
having
no
concern
about
confession
for
the
rest
of
the
year
they
never
aspire
after
god
they
never
retire
into
themselves
but
accumulate
sins
upon
sins
till
they
disembogue
them
as
they
imagine
all
at
once
but
when
they
have
done
this
they
conceive
themselves
to
be
exonerated
of
their
burden
and
to
have
transferred
from
god
the
judgment
they
have
conferred
on
the
priest
and
that
they
have
deprived
god
of
remembrance
by
the
information
they
have
communicated
to
the
priest
besides
who
rejoices
to
see
the
day
of
confession
approaching
who
goes
to
confess
with
alacrity
of
heart
and
does
not
rather
come
with
unwillingness
and
reluctance
as
though
he
were
forcibly
dragged
to
a
prison
except
perhaps
the
priests
who
pleasantly
entertain
themselves
with
mutual
narrations
of
their
exploits
as
with
humorous
anecdotes
i
will
not
soil
much
paper
by
relating
the
monstrous
abominations
with
which
auricular
confession
abounds
i
only
remark
if
that
holy
man
was
not
guilty
of
indiscretion
who
on
account
of
one
rumour
of
fornication
banished
confession
from
his
church
or
rather
from
the
memory
of
his
people
are
thus
reminded
of
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
present
day
when
rapes
adulteries
incests
and
seductions
exceed
all
enumeration
xx
as
the
advocates
of
confession
plead
the
power
of
the
keys
and
rest
upon
it
all
the
merits
of
their
cause
we
must
examine
the
weight
that
is
due
to
this
argument
are
the
keys
then
say
they
given
without
any
reason
is
it
without
any
cause
that
it
is
said
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
do
we
then
frustrate
the
declaration
of
christ
i
reply
that
there
was
an
important
reason
why
the
keys
should
be
given
as
i
have
already
stated
and
shall
again
more
explicitly
show
when
i
come
to
treat
of
excommunication
but
what
if
i
refute
the
whole
of
their
pretensions
with
one
argument
that
their
priests
are
not
vicars
or
successors
of
the
apostles
but
this
also
will
be
discussed
in
another
place
now
they
set
up
as
their
principal
defence
an
engine
by
which
their
whole
structure
may
be
completely
demolished
for
christ
never
conferred
on
his
apostles
the
power
of
binding
and
loosing
till
after
he
had
given
them
the
holy
ghost
i
deny
therefore
that
the
power
of
the
keys
belongs
to
any
who
have
not
previously
received
the
holy
ghost
i
deny
that
any
one
can
use
the
keys
unless
the
spirit
guide
and
instruct
him
and
direct
him
how
he
ought
to
act
they
impertinently
pretend
that
they
have
the
holy
ghost
but
in
reality
they
deny
it
unless
perhaps
they
imagine
as
they
certainly
do
that
the
holy
ghost
is
a
useless
and
worthless
thing
but
they
will
not
be
believed
by
this
weapon
they
are
completely
vanquished
of
whatever
door
they
pretend
to
have
the
key
they
should
always
be
asked
whether
they
have
the
holy
ghost
who
is
the
arbiter
and
governor
of
the
keys
if
they
reply
in
the
affirmative
they
must
be
questioned
again
whether
it
be
possible
for
the
holy
ghost
to
err
this
they
will
not
dare
expressly
to
avow
though
they
obliquely
insinuate
it
in
their
doctrine
we
may
justly
infer
therefore
that
no
priests
have
the
power
of
the
keys
who
without
discrimination
frequently
loose
what
the
lord
had
designed
to
be
bound
and
bind
what
he
had
commanded
to
be
loosed
xxi
when
they
find
themselves
convinced
by
evident
experience
that
they
promiscuously
loose
and
bind
the
worthy
and
the
unworthy
they
arrogate
to
themselves
the
power
without
knowledge
and
though
they
dare
not
deny
that
knowledge
is
requisite
to
a
good
use
of
it
yet
they
tell
us
that
the
power
itself
is
committed
to
improper
dispensers
of
it
but
this
is
the
whatsoever
thou
bindest
or
loosest
on
earth
shall
be
bound
or
loosed
in
either
the
promise
of
christ
must
be
false
or
the
binding
and
loosing
is
rightly
performed
by
those
who
are
endued
with
this
power
nor
is
there
any
room
for
them
to
quibble
that
the
declaration
of
christ
is
limited
according
to
the
merits
of
the
person
that
is
bound
or
loosed
we
also
acknowledge
that
none
can
be
bound
or
loosed
but
such
as
are
worthy
to
be
bound
or
loosed
but
the
preachers
of
the
gospel
and
the
church
have
the
word
as
the
standard
of
this
worthiness
in
this
word
the
ministers
of
the
gospel
may
promise
to
all
remission
of
sins
in
christ
through
faith
they
may
denounce
damnation
against
all
and
upon
all
who
receive
not
christ
in
this
word
the
church
pronounces
that
fornicators
adulterers
thieves
murderers
misers
and
extortioners
have
no
part
in
the
kingdom
of
god
and
binds
such
with
the
firmest
bonds
in
the
same
word
the
church
looses
and
comforts
those
who
repent
but
what
kind
of
power
will
it
be
not
to
know
what
ought
to
be
bound
or
loosed
and
not
to
be
able
to
bind
or
loose
without
this
knowledge
why
then
do
they
say
that
they
absolve
by
the
authority
committed
to
them
when
their
absolution
is
uncertain
why
should
we
concern
ourselves
about
this
imaginary
power
if
it
be
quite
useless
but
i
have
already
ascertained
either
that
it
has
no
existence
or
that
it
is
too
uncertain
to
be
considered
of
any
value
for
as
they
confess
that
there
are
many
of
the
priests
who
make
no
right
use
of
the
keys
and
that
the
power
has
no
efficacy
without
a
legitimate
use
of
it
who
will
assure
me
that
he
by
whom
i
am
loosed
is
a
good
dispenser
of
the
keys
but
if
he
be
a
bad
one
what
else
does
he
possess
but
this
frivolous
dispensation
of
them
what
ought
to
be
bound
or
loosed
in
you
i
know
not
since
i
am
destitute
of
the
proper
use
of
the
keys
but
if
you
deserve
it
i
absolve
you
but
as
much
as
this
might
be
done
i
will
not
say
by
a
layman
since
they
could
not
hear
that
with
any
patience
but
by
a
turk
or
a
devil
for
it
is
equivalent
to
saying
i
have
not
the
word
of
god
which
is
the
certain
rule
of
loosing
but
i
am
invested
with
authority
to
absolve
you
on
condition
that
your
merits
deserve
we
see
then
what
they
intended
when
they
defined
the
keys
to
be
an
authority
of
discerning
and
a
power
of
executing
attended
with
knowledge
as
a
counsellor
to
promote
the
good
use
the
truth
is
that
they
wished
to
reign
according
to
their
own
licentious
inclinations
independently
of
god
and
his
word
xxii
if
it
be
objected
that
the
legitimate
ministers
of
christ
will
be
equally
perplexed
in
their
office
since
the
absolution
which
depends
on
faith
will
ever
be
doubtful
and
that
therefore
sinners
will
have
but
a
slight
consolation
or
none
at
all
since
the
minister
himself
who
is
not
a
competent
judge
of
their
faith
is
not
certain
of
their
absolution
are
prepared
with
an
answer
they
say
that
no
sins
are
remitted
by
the
priest
but
those
which
fall
under
his
cognizance
thus
according
to
them
remission
depends
on
the
judgment
of
the
priest
and
unless
he
sagaciously
discerns
who
are
worthy
of
pardon
the
whole
transaction
is
frivolous
and
useless
in
short
the
power
of
which
they
speak
is
a
jurisdiction
annexed
to
examination
to
which
pardon
and
absolution
are
restricted
in
this
statement
we
find
no
firm
footing
but
rather
a
bottomless
abyss
for
where
the
confession
is
deficient
the
hope
of
pardon
is
also
imperfect
in
the
next
place
the
priest
himself
must
necessarily
remain
in
suspense
while
he
is
ignorant
whether
the
sinner
faithfully
enumerates
all
his
crimes
lastly
such
is
the
ignorance
and
inexperience
of
priests
that
the
majority
of
them
are
no
more
qualified
for
the
exercise
of
this
office
than
a
shoemaker
for
cultivating
the
ground
and
almost
all
the
rest
ought
justly
to
be
suspicious
of
themselves
hence
then
the
perplexity
and
doubtfulness
of
the
papal
absolution
because
they
maintain
it
to
be
founded
on
the
person
of
the
priest
and
not
only
so
but
on
his
knowledge
so
that
he
can
only
judge
of
what
he
hears
examines
and
ascertains
now
should
any
one
inquire
of
these
good
doctors
whether
a
sinner
be
reconciled
to
god
on
the
remission
of
part
of
his
sins
i
know
not
what
answer
they
can
give
without
being
constrained
to
acknowledge
the
inefficacy
of
whatever
the
priest
may
pronounce
concerning
the
remission
of
sins
which
he
has
heard
enumerated
as
long
as
the
guilt
of
others
still
remains
what
a
pernicious
anxiety
must
oppress
the
conscience
of
the
person
that
confesses
appears
from
this
consideration
that
while
he
relies
on
the
discretion
of
the
priest
as
they
express
themselves
he
decides
nothing
by
the
word
of
god
the
doctrine
maintained
by
us
is
perfectly
free
from
all
these
absurdities
for
absolution
is
conditional
in
such
a
way
that
the
sinner
may
be
confident
that
god
is
propitious
to
him
provided
he
sincerely
seeks
an
atonement
in
the
sacrifice
of
christ
and
relies
upon
the
grace
offered
to
him
thus
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
err
who
according
to
his
duty
as
a
preacher
promulgates
what
he
has
been
taught
by
the
divine
word
and
the
sinner
may
receive
a
certain
and
clear
absolution
simply
on
condition
of
embracing
the
grace
of
christ
according
to
that
general
rule
of
our
lord
himself
which
has
been
impiously
despised
among
the
according
to
your
faith
be
it
unto
xxiii
their
absurd
confusion
of
the
clear
representations
of
the
scripture
concerning
the
power
of
the
keys
i
have
promised
to
expose
in
another
place
and
a
more
suitable
opportunity
will
present
itself
in
discussing
the
government
of
the
church
but
let
the
reader
remember
that
they
preposterously
pervert
to
auricular
and
secret
confession
passages
which
are
spoken
by
christ
partly
of
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
and
partly
of
excommunication
wherefore
when
they
object
that
the
power
of
loosing
was
committed
to
the
apostles
which
is
now
exercised
by
the
priests
in
remitting
the
sins
confessed
to
them
it
is
evidently
an
assumption
of
a
false
and
frivolous
principle
for
the
absolution
consequent
on
faith
is
nothing
but
a
declaration
of
pardon
taken
from
the
gracious
promise
of
the
gospel
but
the
other
absolution
which
depends
on
ecclesiastical
discipline
relates
not
to
secret
sins
but
is
rather
for
the
sake
of
example
that
the
public
offence
of
the
church
may
be
removed
they
rake
together
testimonies
from
every
quarter
to
prove
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
make
a
confession
of
sins
to
god
or
to
laymen
unless
they
are
likewise
submitted
to
the
cognizance
of
a
priest
but
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
such
a
disgusting
employment
for
if
the
ancient
fathers
sometimes
persuade
sinners
to
disburden
themselves
to
their
own
pastor
it
can
not
be
understood
of
a
particular
enumeration
of
sins
which
was
not
then
practised
moreover
lombard
and
others
of
the
same
class
have
been
so
unfair
that
they
appear
to
have
designedly
consulted
spurious
books
in
order
to
use
them
as
a
pretext
to
deceive
the
unwary
they
do
indeed
properly
acknowledge
that
since
loosing
always
accompanies
repentance
there
really
remains
no
bond
where
any
one
has
experienced
repentance
although
he
may
not
yet
have
made
a
confession
and
therefore
that
then
the
priest
does
not
so
much
remit
sins
as
pronounce
and
declare
them
to
be
remitted
though
in
the
word
they
insinuate
a
gross
error
substituting
a
ceremony
in
the
place
of
instruction
but
by
adding
that
he
who
had
already
obtained
pardon
before
god
is
absolved
in
the
view
of
the
church
they
unseasonably
apply
to
the
particular
use
of
every
individual
what
we
have
already
asserted
to
have
been
appointed
as
a
part
of
the
common
discipline
of
the
church
when
the
offence
of
some
great
and
notorious
crime
requires
to
be
removed
but
they
presently
corrupt
and
destroy
all
the
moderation
they
had
observed
by
adding
another
mode
of
remission
that
is
with
an
injunction
of
punishment
and
satisfaction
by
which
they
arrogantly
ascribe
to
their
priests
the
power
of
dividing
into
two
parts
what
god
has
every
where
promised
as
complete
for
as
he
simply
requires
repentance
and
faith
this
partition
or
exception
is
an
evident
sacrilege
for
it
is
just
as
if
the
priest
sustaining
the
character
of
a
tribune
should
interpose
his
and
not
suffer
god
of
his
mere
goodness
to
receive
any
one
into
favour
unless
he
had
lain
prostrate
before
the
tribunitial
seat
and
there
been
punished
xxiv
the
whole
argument
comes
to
if
they
will
represent
god
as
the
author
of
this
fictitious
confession
it
is
a
full
proof
of
their
error
for
i
have
pointed
out
their
fallacies
in
the
few
passages
which
they
quote
but
since
it
is
evident
that
this
is
a
law
of
human
imposition
i
assert
that
it
is
also
tyrannical
and
injurious
to
god
who
binds
the
consciences
of
men
by
his
word
and
whose
will
it
is
that
they
should
be
free
from
the
authority
of
men
now
when
they
prescribe
as
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
pardon
that
which
god
has
chosen
should
be
free
i
maintain
that
it
is
an
intolerable
sacrilege
for
nothing
is
more
peculiarly
the
prerogative
of
god
than
the
remission
of
sins
in
which
our
salvation
consists
i
have
moreover
proved
that
this
tyranny
was
not
introduced
till
the
world
was
oppressed
with
the
rudest
barbarism
i
have
likewise
shown
that
it
is
a
pestilent
law
because
if
wretched
souls
are
affected
with
the
fear
of
god
it
precipitates
them
into
despair
or
if
they
are
in
a
state
of
careless
security
it
soothes
them
with
vain
flatteries
and
renders
them
still
more
insensible
lastly
i
have
stated
that
all
the
mitigations
which
they
add
have
no
other
tendency
than
to
perplex
obscure
and
corrupt
the
pure
doctrine
and
to
conceal
their
impieties
under
false
and
illusive
colours
xxv
the
third
place
in
repentance
they
assign
to
all
their
jargon
concerning
which
may
be
overturned
in
one
word
they
say
that
it
is
not
sufficient
for
a
penitent
to
abstain
from
his
former
sins
and
to
change
his
morals
for
the
better
unless
he
make
satisfaction
to
god
for
the
crimes
which
he
has
committed
and
that
there
are
many
helps
by
which
we
may
redeem
sins
such
as
tears
fastings
oblations
and
works
of
charity
that
by
these
the
lord
is
to
be
propitiated
by
these
our
debts
are
to
be
paid
to
the
divine
justice
by
these
we
must
compensate
for
the
guilt
of
our
sins
by
these
we
must
merit
pardon
for
that
though
in
the
plenitude
of
his
mercy
he
has
remitted
our
sins
yet
in
the
discipline
of
justice
he
retains
the
punishment
and
that
this
is
the
punishment
which
must
be
redeemed
by
all
that
they
say
however
comes
to
this
we
obtain
the
pardon
of
our
transgressions
from
the
mercy
of
god
but
that
it
is
by
the
intervention
of
the
merit
of
works
by
which
the
evil
of
our
sins
must
be
compensated
that
the
divine
justice
may
receive
the
satisfaction
which
is
due
to
it
to
such
falsehoods
i
oppose
the
gratuitous
remission
of
sins
than
which
there
is
nothing
more
clearly
revealed
in
the
scripture
in
the
first
place
what
is
remission
but
a
gift
of
mere
liberality
for
the
creditor
is
not
said
to
forgive
who
testifies
by
a
receipt
that
the
debt
has
been
paid
but
he
who
without
any
payment
merely
through
his
beneficence
voluntarily
cancels
the
obligation
in
the
next
place
why
is
this
said
to
be
free
but
to
preclude
every
idea
of
satisfaction
with
what
confidence
then
can
they
still
set
up
their
satisfactions
which
are
overthrown
by
such
a
mighty
thunderbolt
but
when
the
lord
proclaims
by
isaiah
i
even
i
am
he
that
blotteth
out
thy
transgressions
for
mine
own
sake
and
will
not
remember
thy
sins
does
he
not
evidently
declare
that
he
derives
the
cause
and
foundation
of
forgiveness
merely
from
his
own
goodness
besides
while
the
whole
scripture
bears
testimony
to
christ
that
remission
of
sins
is
to
be
received
through
his
name
does
it
not
exclude
all
other
names
how
then
do
they
teach
that
it
is
received
through
the
name
of
nor
can
they
deny
that
they
ascribe
this
to
satisfactions
although
they
call
their
intervention
for
when
the
scripture
states
it
to
be
through
the
name
of
christ
it
signifies
that
we
bring
nothing
that
we
plead
nothing
of
our
own
but
rely
solely
on
the
mediation
of
christ
as
paul
after
affirming
that
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
them
immediately
adds
the
method
and
nature
of
it
for
he
hath
made
him
who
knew
no
sin
to
be
sin
for
xxvi
but
such
is
their
perverseness
they
reply
that
both
remission
of
sins
and
reconciliation
are
obtained
at
once
when
in
baptism
we
are
received
into
the
favour
of
god
through
christ
that
if
we
fall
after
baptism
we
are
to
be
raised
up
again
by
and
that
the
blood
of
christ
avails
us
nothing
any
further
than
it
is
dispensed
by
the
keys
of
the
church
i
am
not
speaking
of
a
doubtful
point
for
they
have
betrayed
their
impurity
in
the
most
explicit
terms
and
this
is
the
case
not
only
of
two
or
three
but
of
all
the
schoolmen
for
their
master
lombard
after
having
confessed
that
according
to
the
doctrine
of
peter
christ
suffered
the
punishment
of
sins
on
the
cross
immediately
corrects
that
sentiment
by
the
addition
of
the
following
exception
that
all
the
temporal
punishments
of
sins
are
remitted
in
baptism
but
that
after
baptism
they
are
diminished
by
means
of
repentance
so
that
our
repentance
coöperates
with
the
cross
of
christ
but
john
speaks
a
very
different
language
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
jesus
christ
the
righteous
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
i
write
unto
you
little
children
because
your
sins
are
forgiven
you
for
his
name
s
he
certainly
addresses
believers
and
when
he
exhibits
christ
to
them
as
the
propitiation
for
sins
proves
that
there
is
no
other
satisfaction
by
which
our
offended
god
may
be
propitiated
or
appeased
he
says
not
god
was
once
reconciled
to
you
by
christ
now
seek
some
other
means
but
represents
him
as
a
perpetual
advocate
who
by
his
intercession
restores
us
to
the
father
s
favour
for
ever
and
as
a
perpetual
propitiation
by
which
our
sins
are
expiated
for
this
is
perpetually
true
that
was
declared
by
the
other
john
behold
the
lamb
of
god
which
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
he
takes
them
away
himself
i
say
and
no
other
that
is
since
he
alone
is
the
lamb
of
god
he
alone
is
the
oblation
the
expiation
the
satisfaction
for
sins
for
the
right
and
power
to
forgive
being
the
peculiar
prerogative
of
the
father
as
distinguished
from
the
son
as
we
have
already
seen
christ
is
here
represented
in
another
capacity
since
by
transferring
to
himself
the
punishment
we
deserved
he
has
obliterated
our
guilt
before
the
throne
of
god
whence
it
follows
that
we
shall
not
be
partakers
of
the
atonement
of
christ
in
any
other
way
unless
he
remain
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
that
honour
which
they
unjustly
assume
to
themselves
who
endeavour
to
appease
god
by
satisfactions
of
their
own
xxvii
and
here
two
things
demand
our
the
honour
which
belongs
to
christ
should
be
preserved
to
him
entire
and
undiminished
and
that
consciences
assured
of
the
pardon
of
their
sins
should
have
peace
with
god
isaiah
says
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
with
his
stripes
we
are
peter
repeating
the
same
truth
in
different
words
says
that
christ
bare
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
paul
informs
us
that
sin
was
condemned
in
the
flesh
when
christ
was
made
sin
for
us
that
is
that
the
power
and
curse
of
sin
were
destroyed
in
his
flesh
when
he
was
given
as
a
victim
to
sustain
the
whole
load
of
our
sins
with
their
curse
and
execrations
with
the
dreadful
judgment
of
god
and
the
condemnation
of
death
we
can
not
here
listen
to
those
foolish
fictions
that
after
the
initial
purgation
or
baptism
none
of
us
can
have
any
further
experience
of
the
efficacy
of
the
sufferings
of
christ
than
in
proportion
to
a
satisfactory
repentance
but
whenever
we
have
fallen
the
scripture
recalls
us
to
the
satisfaction
of
christ
alone
now
review
their
pestilent
follies
that
the
grace
of
god
operates
alone
in
the
first
remission
of
sins
but
that
if
we
afterwards
fall
our
works
coöperate
with
it
in
the
impetration
of
a
second
if
these
things
be
admitted
does
christ
remain
exclusively
possessed
of
what
we
have
before
attributed
to
him
how
immensely
wide
is
the
difference
between
these
our
iniquities
are
laid
on
christ
to
be
expiated
by
him
and
that
they
are
expiated
by
our
own
works
that
christ
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
and
that
god
must
be
propitiated
by
works
but
with
respect
to
pacifying
the
conscience
what
peace
will
it
afford
any
one
to
hear
that
sins
are
redeemed
by
satisfactions
when
will
he
be
assured
of
the
accomplishment
of
satisfaction
therefore
he
will
always
doubt
whether
god
be
propitious
to
him
he
will
always
be
in
a
state
of
fluctuation
and
terror
for
those
who
content
themselves
with
trivial
satisfactions
have
too
contemptuous
sentiments
of
the
judgment
of
god
and
reflect
very
little
on
the
vast
evil
of
sin
as
we
shall
elsewhere
observe
but
though
we
should
allow
them
to
expiate
some
sins
by
a
proper
satisfaction
yet
what
will
they
do
when
they
are
overwhelmed
with
so
many
sins
that
to
make
adequate
satisfactions
for
them
even
a
hundred
lives
entirely
devoted
to
it
could
not
possibly
be
sufficient
besides
all
the
passages
in
which
remission
of
sins
is
declared
are
not
addressed
to
catechumens
or
persons
not
yet
baptized
but
to
the
regenerated
sons
of
god
and
those
who
have
been
long
nurtured
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
that
embassy
which
paul
so
splendidly
extols
we
pray
you
in
christ
s
stead
be
ye
reconciled
to
god
is
directed
not
to
strangers
but
to
those
who
had
already
been
regenerated
but
dismissing
all
satisfactions
he
sends
them
to
the
cross
of
christ
thus
when
he
writes
to
the
colossians
that
christ
had
made
peace
by
the
blood
of
his
cross
and
reconciled
all
things
both
in
earth
and
in
heaven
he
restricts
not
this
to
the
moment
of
our
reception
into
the
church
but
extends
it
through
our
whole
course
as
is
evident
from
the
context
where
he
says
that
believers
have
redemption
through
his
blood
even
the
forgiveness
of
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
accumulate
more
passages
which
are
frequently
occurring
xxviii
here
they
take
refuge
in
a
foolish
distinction
that
some
sins
are
and
some
that
a
great
satisfaction
is
due
for
mortal
sins
but
that
those
which
are
venial
are
purged
away
by
easier
remedies
by
the
lord
s
prayer
the
aspersion
of
holy
water
and
the
absolution
of
the
mass
thus
they
sport
and
trifle
with
god
but
though
they
are
incessantly
talking
of
venial
and
mortal
sins
yet
they
have
never
been
able
to
discriminate
one
from
the
other
except
by
making
impiety
and
impurity
of
heart
a
venial
sin
but
we
maintain
according
to
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
the
only
standard
of
righteousness
and
sin
that
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
and
the
soul
that
sinneth
it
shall
die
but
that
the
sins
of
believers
are
venial
not
because
they
are
not
deserving
of
death
but
because
through
the
mercy
of
god
there
is
no
condemnation
to
them
which
are
in
christ
jesus
because
they
are
not
imputed
to
them
but
obliterated
by
a
pardon
i
know
their
unjust
calumnies
against
this
doctrine
of
ours
they
assert
it
to
be
the
stoical
paradox
concerning
the
equality
of
sins
but
they
will
easily
be
refuted
out
of
their
own
lips
for
i
ask
whether
among
those
very
sins
which
they
confess
to
be
mortal
they
do
not
acknowledge
one
to
be
greater
or
less
than
another
it
does
not
therefore
immediately
follow
that
sins
are
equal
because
they
are
alike
mortal
since
the
scripture
declares
that
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
that
obedience
to
the
law
is
the
way
of
life
and
the
transgression
of
it
death
they
can
not
evade
this
decision
what
end
then
will
they
find
to
satisfactions
in
so
great
an
accumulation
of
sins
if
it
be
the
business
of
one
day
to
satisfy
for
one
sin
while
they
are
employed
in
that
they
involve
themselves
in
more
for
the
most
righteous
man
can
not
pass
a
single
day
without
falling
several
times
while
they
shall
be
preparing
themselves
to
make
satisfaction
for
these
they
will
accumulate
a
numerous
or
rather
an
innumerable
multitude
now
all
confidence
in
satisfaction
is
cut
off
on
what
do
they
depend
how
do
they
still
presume
to
think
of
making
satisfaction
xxix
they
endeavour
to
extricate
themselves
from
this
difficulty
but
without
success
they
invent
a
distinction
between
the
guilt
and
the
punishment
and
acknowledge
that
the
guilt
is
forgiven
by
the
divine
mercy
but
maintain
that
after
the
remission
of
the
guilt
there
still
remains
the
punishment
which
the
divine
justice
requires
to
be
suffered
and
therefore
that
satisfactions
properly
relate
to
the
remission
of
the
punishment
what
desultory
levity
is
this
now
they
confess
that
remission
of
guilt
is
proposed
as
gratuitous
which
they
are
continually
teaching
men
to
merit
by
prayers
and
tears
and
other
preparations
of
various
kinds
but
every
thing
delivered
in
the
scripture
concerning
remission
of
sins
is
diametrically
opposite
to
this
distinction
and
though
i
think
i
have
fully
established
this
point
already
i
will
subjoin
some
additional
testimonies
by
which
our
opponents
will
be
so
much
embarrassed
as
notwithstanding
all
their
serpentine
lubricity
to
be
totally
unable
ever
to
extricate
themselves
this
is
the
new
covenant
which
god
has
made
with
us
in
christ
that
he
will
not
remember
our
the
import
of
these
expressions
we
learn
from
another
prophet
by
whom
the
lord
says
when
the
righteous
turneth
away
from
his
righteousness
all
his
righteousness
that
he
hath
done
shall
not
be
mentioned
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
away
from
his
wickedness
he
shall
surely
live
he
shall
not
not
to
mention
righteousness
signifies
not
to
notice
it
so
as
to
reward
it
and
not
to
remember
sins
is
not
to
inflict
punishment
for
them
this
is
expressed
in
other
passages
by
the
following
phrases
to
cast
behind
the
back
to
blot
out
as
a
cloud
to
cast
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
not
to
impute
to
these
forms
of
expression
would
clearly
convey
to
us
the
sense
of
the
holy
spirit
if
we
attended
to
them
with
docility
if
god
punishes
sins
he
certainly
imputes
them
if
he
avenges
them
he
remembers
them
if
he
cites
them
to
judgment
he
does
not
cover
them
if
he
examines
them
he
has
not
cast
them
behind
his
back
if
he
inspects
them
he
has
not
blotted
them
out
as
a
cloud
if
he
scrutinizes
them
he
has
not
cast
them
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
in
this
manner
the
subject
is
clearly
explained
by
augustine
if
god
has
covered
sins
he
would
not
look
at
them
if
he
would
not
look
at
them
he
would
not
take
cognizance
of
them
if
he
would
not
take
cognizance
of
them
he
would
not
punish
them
he
would
not
know
them
he
would
rather
forgive
them
why
then
has
he
said
that
sins
are
covered
that
they
might
not
be
seen
for
what
is
meant
by
god
s
seeing
sin
but
his
punishing
it
let
us
also
hear
from
another
passage
of
the
prophet
on
what
conditions
god
remits
sins
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
says
he
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
like
crimson
they
shall
be
as
and
in
jeremiah
we
find
this
declaration
in
that
time
the
iniquities
of
israel
shall
be
sought
for
and
there
shall
be
none
and
the
sins
of
judah
and
they
shall
not
be
found
for
i
will
pardon
them
whom
i
would
you
briefly
know
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
consider
on
the
contrary
the
import
of
the
following
expressions
the
lord
seweth
up
iniquity
in
a
bag
iniquity
is
bound
up
sin
is
hid
to
write
sins
with
a
pen
of
iron
and
engrave
them
with
the
point
of
a
if
they
signify
that
god
will
execute
vengeance
as
they
undoubtedly
do
neither
can
it
be
doubted
but
that
by
the
contrary
declaration
the
lord
proclaims
his
remission
of
all
vindictive
punishment
here
i
must
conjure
my
readers
not
to
listen
to
my
expositions
but
only
to
pay
some
deference
to
the
word
of
god
xxx
what
would
christ
have
done
for
us
if
punishment
for
sins
were
still
inflicted
on
us
for
when
we
say
that
he
bare
all
our
sins
in
his
own
body
on
the
tree
we
intend
only
that
he
sustained
the
vindictive
punishment
which
was
due
to
our
sins
this
sentiment
is
more
significantly
expressed
by
isaiah
when
he
says
that
the
chastisement
or
correction
of
our
peace
was
upon
now
what
is
the
correction
of
our
peace
but
the
punishment
due
to
sins
and
which
we
must
have
suffered
before
we
could
be
reconciled
to
god
if
he
had
not
become
our
substitute
thus
we
see
clearly
that
christ
bore
the
punishment
of
sins
that
he
might
deliver
his
people
from
it
and
whenever
paul
mentions
the
redemption
accomplished
by
him
he
generally
calls
it
ἀπολυτρωσις
which
signifies
not
simply
redemption
as
it
is
commonly
understood
but
the
price
and
satisfaction
of
redemption
thus
he
says
that
christ
gave
himself
a
ransom
αντιλυτρον
for
us
what
propitiation
is
there
with
the
lord
says
augustine
but
sacrifice
and
what
sacrifice
is
there
but
that
which
has
been
offered
for
us
in
the
death
of
christ
but
the
institutions
of
the
law
of
moses
respecting
expiations
for
sins
furnish
us
with
a
most
powerful
argument
for
there
the
lord
prescribes
not
this
or
the
other
method
of
satisfying
but
requires
the
whole
compensation
in
sacrifices
though
he
specifies
all
the
rites
of
expiation
with
the
most
particular
care
and
in
the
most
exact
order
how
is
it
that
he
commands
the
expiation
of
sins
without
any
works
at
all
requiring
no
other
atonement
than
by
sacrifices
but
because
he
intends
in
this
way
to
declare
that
there
is
only
one
kind
of
satisfaction
by
which
his
justice
is
appeased
for
the
sacrifices
then
immolated
by
the
israelites
were
not
considered
as
the
works
of
men
but
were
estimated
according
to
their
antitype
that
is
the
one
sacrifice
of
christ
alone
the
nature
of
the
compensation
which
the
lord
receives
from
us
is
concisely
and
beautifully
expressed
by
hosea
take
away
saith
he
all
iniquity
o
lord
here
is
remission
of
sins
so
will
we
render
the
calves
of
our
lips
here
is
satisfaction
which
is
no
other
than
thanksgiving
i
am
aware
of
another
still
more
subtle
evasion
to
which
they
resort
by
distinguishing
between
eternal
punishments
and
those
which
are
temporal
but
when
they
assert
that
temporal
punishment
is
any
suffering
inflicted
by
god
on
the
body
or
the
soul
eternal
death
only
excepted
this
limitation
affords
them
but
little
assistance
for
the
passages
which
we
have
cited
above
expressly
signify
that
god
receives
us
into
favour
on
this
condition
that
in
forgiving
our
guilt
he
remits
all
the
punishment
that
we
had
deserved
and
whenever
david
or
the
other
prophets
implore
the
pardon
of
their
sins
they
at
the
same
time
deprecate
the
punishment
and
to
this
they
are
impelled
by
an
apprehension
of
the
divine
judgment
again
when
they
promise
mercy
from
the
lord
they
almost
always
professedly
speak
of
punishments
and
of
the
remission
of
them
certainly
when
the
lord
announces
by
ezekiel
that
he
will
put
an
end
to
the
babylonian
captivity
and
that
for
his
own
sake
not
for
the
sake
of
the
jews
he
sufficiently
shows
this
deliverance
to
be
gratuitous
finally
if
christ
delivers
us
from
guilt
the
punishments
consequent
upon
it
must
necessarily
cease
xxxi
but
as
our
adversaries
also
on
their
part
arm
themselves
with
testimonies
from
the
scripture
let
us
examine
what
arguments
they
offer
they
reason
in
this
way
david
after
having
been
reproved
by
nathan
the
prophet
for
adultery
and
murder
receives
the
pardon
of
his
sin
and
yet
is
afterwards
punished
by
the
death
of
the
son
that
was
the
fruit
of
his
adultery
we
are
taught
to
compensate
by
satisfactions
for
such
punishments
as
would
be
inflicted
even
after
the
remission
of
the
guilt
for
daniel
exhorted
nebuchadnezzar
to
atone
for
his
sins
by
acts
of
mercy
and
solomon
says
by
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is
and
that
charity
shall
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
is
a
sentiment
confirmed
by
the
united
testimony
of
solomon
and
peter
the
lord
also
says
in
luke
concerning
the
woman
that
had
been
a
sinner
her
sins
are
forgiven
for
she
loved
how
perversely
and
preposterously
they
always
estimate
the
divine
proceedings
but
if
they
had
observed
what
should
by
no
means
have
been
overlooked
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
divine
judgment
they
would
have
seen
in
this
correction
of
david
a
species
of
punishment
very
different
from
that
which
may
be
considered
as
vindictive
but
since
it
highly
concerns
us
all
to
understand
the
design
of
those
chastisements
with
which
god
corrects
our
sins
and
how
greatly
they
differ
from
the
examples
of
his
indignation
pursuing
the
impious
and
reprobate
i
conceive
it
will
not
be
unseasonable
to
give
a
summary
account
of
them
for
the
sake
of
perspicuity
let
us
call
one
or
and
the
other
or
in
vindictive
judgment
god
is
to
be
contemplated
as
taking
vengeance
on
his
enemies
so
as
to
exert
his
wrath
against
them
to
confound
dissipate
and
reduce
them
to
nothing
we
consider
it
therefore
strictly
speaking
to
be
the
vengeance
of
god
when
the
punishment
he
inflicts
is
attended
with
his
indignation
in
disciplinary
judgment
he
is
not
so
severe
as
to
be
angry
nor
does
he
punish
in
order
to
destroy
or
precipitate
into
perdition
wherefore
it
is
not
properly
punishment
or
vengeance
but
correction
and
admonition
the
former
is
the
part
of
a
judge
the
latter
of
a
father
for
a
judge
when
he
punishes
an
offender
attends
to
the
crime
itself
and
inflicts
punishment
according
to
the
nature
and
aggravations
of
it
when
a
father
corrects
his
child
with
severity
he
does
it
not
to
take
vengeance
or
satisfaction
but
rather
to
teach
him
and
render
him
more
cautious
for
the
future
chrysostom
somewhere
uses
a
comparison
a
little
different
which
nevertheless
comes
to
the
same
point
a
son
says
he
is
beaten
a
servant
also
is
beaten
but
the
latter
is
punished
as
a
slave
because
he
has
transgressed
the
former
is
chastised
as
free
and
a
son
that
needs
to
be
correction
serves
to
the
latter
for
a
probation
and
reformation
to
the
former
for
a
scourge
and
a
punishment
xxxii
to
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
whole
subject
in
a
small
compass
it
is
necessary
to
state
two
distinctions
respecting
it
the
first
is
that
wherever
there
is
vindictive
punishment
there
also
is
a
manifestation
of
the
curse
and
wrath
of
god
which
he
always
withholds
from
believers
chastisement
on
the
contrary
is
as
the
scripture
teaches
us
both
a
blessing
of
god
and
a
testimony
of
his
love
this
difference
is
sufficiently
marked
in
every
part
of
the
divine
word
for
all
the
afflictions
which
the
impious
endure
in
the
present
life
are
represented
to
us
as
constituting
a
kind
of
antechamber
of
hell
whence
they
already
have
a
distant
prospect
of
their
eternal
damnation
and
they
are
so
far
from
being
reformed
or
receiving
any
benefit
from
this
that
they
are
rather
prepared
by
such
preludes
for
that
most
tremendous
vengeance
which
finally
awaits
them
on
the
contrary
the
lord
repeatedly
chastises
his
servants
yet
does
not
deliver
them
over
to
death
wherefore
they
confess
that
the
strokes
of
his
rod
were
highly
beneficial
and
instructive
to
them
as
we
every
where
find
that
the
saints
bore
these
corrections
with
resignation
of
soul
so
they
always
earnestly
deprecated
punishments
of
the
former
kind
jeremiah
says
o
lord
correct
me
but
with
judgment
not
in
thine
anger
lest
thou
bring
me
to
nothing
pour
out
thy
fury
upon
the
heathen
that
know
thee
not
and
upon
the
families
that
call
not
upon
thy
and
david
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thine
anger
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
nor
is
it
any
objection
to
this
that
the
lord
is
frequently
said
to
be
angry
with
his
saints
when
he
chastises
them
for
their
sins
as
in
isaiah
o
lord
i
will
praise
thee
though
thou
wast
angry
with
me
thine
anger
is
turned
away
and
thou
comfortedst
habakkuk
also
in
wrath
remember
and
micah
i
will
bear
the
indignation
of
the
lord
because
i
have
sinned
against
which
reminds
us
not
only
that
those
who
are
justly
punished
receive
no
advantage
from
murmuring
but
that
the
faithful
derive
a
mitigation
of
their
sorrow
from
a
consideration
of
the
intention
of
god
for
on
the
same
account
he
is
said
to
profane
his
own
inheritance
which
however
we
know
he
never
will
profane
that
relates
not
to
the
design
or
disposition
of
god
in
punishing
but
to
the
vehement
sense
of
sorrow
experienced
by
those
who
suffer
any
of
his
severity
he
not
only
distresses
his
believing
people
with
no
small
degree
of
rigour
but
sometimes
wounds
them
in
such
a
manner
that
they
seem
to
themselves
to
be
on
the
brink
of
infernal
destruction
thus
he
declares
that
they
have
deserved
his
wrath
and
this
in
order
that
they
may
be
displeased
with
themselves
in
their
distresses
may
be
influenced
by
a
greater
concern
to
appease
god
and
may
hasten
with
solicitude
to
implore
his
pardon
but
in
this
very
procedure
he
exhibits
a
brighter
testimony
of
his
clemency
than
of
his
wrath
the
covenant
still
remains
which
was
made
with
us
in
our
true
solomon
and
the
validity
of
which
he
who
can
not
deceive
has
declared
shall
never
be
diminished
if
his
children
forsake
my
law
and
walk
not
in
my
commandments
if
they
break
my
statutes
and
keep
not
my
commandments
then
will
i
visit
their
transgressions
with
the
rod
and
their
iniquities
with
stripes
nevertheless
my
will
i
not
utterly
take
from
to
assure
us
of
this
he
says
that
the
rod
with
which
he
will
chastise
the
posterity
of
solomon
and
the
stripes
he
will
inflict
on
them
will
be
the
rod
of
men
and
the
stripes
of
the
children
of
while
by
these
phrases
he
signifies
moderation
and
lenity
he
also
implies
that
those
who
feel
his
hand
exerted
against
them
can
not
but
be
confounded
with
an
extreme
and
deadly
horror
how
much
he
observes
this
lenity
in
chastising
his
israel
he
shows
by
the
prophet
i
have
refined
thee
says
he
but
not
with
silver
for
thou
wouldst
have
been
wholly
though
he
teaches
him
that
chastisements
serve
to
purify
him
yet
he
adds
that
he
so
far
moderates
them
that
they
may
not
exceed
what
he
is
able
to
bear
and
this
is
highly
necessary
for
the
more
a
man
reveres
god
and
devotes
himself
to
the
cultivation
of
piety
he
is
so
much
the
more
tender
to
bear
his
wrath
for
though
the
reprobate
groan
under
his
scourges
yet
because
they
consider
not
the
cause
but
rather
turn
their
backs
both
on
their
sins
and
on
the
divine
judgments
from
this
carelessness
they
contract
an
insensibility
or
because
they
murmur
and
resist
and
rebel
against
their
judge
that
furious
impetuosity
stupefies
them
with
madness
and
rage
but
believers
admonished
by
the
divine
corrections
immediately
descend
to
the
consideration
of
their
sins
and
stricken
with
fear
and
dread
resort
to
a
suppliant
deprecation
of
punishment
if
god
did
not
mitigate
these
sorrows
with
which
wretched
souls
torment
themselves
they
would
be
continually
fainting
even
under
slight
tokens
of
his
wrath
xxxiii
the
second
distinction
is
that
when
the
reprobate
are
lashed
by
the
scourges
of
god
in
this
world
they
already
begin
to
suffer
his
vindictive
punishments
and
though
they
will
not
escape
with
impunity
for
having
disregarded
such
indications
of
the
divine
wrath
yet
they
are
not
punished
in
order
to
their
repentance
but
only
that
from
their
great
misery
they
may
prove
god
to
be
a
judge
who
will
inflict
vengeance
according
to
their
crimes
on
the
contrary
the
children
of
god
are
chastised
not
to
make
satisfaction
to
him
for
their
sins
but
that
they
may
thereby
be
benefited
and
brought
to
repentance
wherefore
we
see
that
such
chastisements
relate
to
the
future
rather
than
the
past
to
express
this
i
would
prefer
chrysostom
s
language
to
my
own
for
this
reason
says
he
god
punishes
us
not
to
take
vengeance
for
our
sins
but
to
correct
us
for
the
thus
also
augustine
that
which
you
suffer
and
which
causes
you
to
mourn
is
a
medicine
to
you
not
a
punishment
a
chastisement
and
not
damnation
reject
not
the
scourge
if
you
desire
not
to
be
rejected
from
the
inheritance
all
this
misery
of
mankind
under
which
the
world
groans
know
brethren
that
it
is
a
medicinal
sorrow
not
a
penal
these
passages
i
have
therefore
thought
proper
to
quote
that
no
one
might
consider
the
phraseology
which
i
have
adopted
to
be
novel
or
unusual
and
to
the
same
purpose
are
the
indignant
complaints
in
which
the
lord
frequently
expostulates
on
account
of
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
and
their
obstinate
contempt
of
all
their
punishments
in
isaiah
why
should
ye
be
stricken
any
more
from
the
sole
of
the
foot
even
unto
the
head
there
is
no
but
as
the
prophets
abound
in
such
passages
it
will
be
sufficient
briefly
to
have
suggested
that
god
punishes
his
church
with
no
other
design
than
to
subdue
it
to
repentance
therefore
when
he
rejected
saul
from
the
kingdom
he
punished
him
in
a
vindictive
manner
when
he
deprived
david
of
his
infant
son
he
corrected
him
in
order
to
his
reformation
in
this
sense
we
must
understand
the
observation
of
paul
when
we
are
judged
we
are
chastened
of
the
lord
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
that
is
when
we
the
children
of
god
are
afflicted
by
the
hand
of
our
heavenly
father
this
is
not
a
punishment
to
confound
us
but
only
a
chastisement
to
instruct
us
in
which
augustine
evidently
coincides
with
us
for
he
teaches
that
the
punishments
with
which
men
are
equally
chastised
by
god
are
to
be
considered
in
different
points
of
view
because
to
the
saints
after
the
remission
of
their
sins
they
are
conflicts
and
exercises
but
to
the
reprobate
whose
sins
are
not
forgiven
they
are
the
penalties
due
to
their
iniquity
he
also
mentions
the
punishments
inflicted
on
david
and
other
pious
persons
and
says
that
those
chastisements
tended
to
promote
their
humility
and
thereby
to
exercise
and
prove
their
piety
and
the
declaration
of
isaiah
that
jerusalem
s
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord
s
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
proves
not
the
pardon
of
transgressions
to
depend
on
the
suffering
of
the
punishment
but
is
just
as
though
he
had
said
punishments
enough
have
now
been
inflicted
on
you
and
as
the
severity
and
multitude
of
them
have
harassed
you
with
a
long
continuance
of
grief
and
sorrow
it
is
time
for
you
to
receive
the
message
of
complete
mercy
that
your
hearts
may
be
expanded
with
joy
and
experience
me
to
be
your
for
god
there
assumes
the
character
of
a
father
who
repents
even
of
his
righteous
severity
when
he
has
been
constrained
to
chastise
his
son
with
any
degree
of
rigour
xxxiv
it
is
necessary
that
the
faithful
should
be
provided
with
these
reflections
in
the
anguish
of
afflictions
the
time
is
come
that
judgment
must
begin
at
the
house
of
god
upon
which
his
name
is
what
would
the
children
of
god
do
if
they
believed
the
severity
which
they
feel
to
be
the
vengeance
of
god
upon
them
for
he
who
under
the
strokes
of
the
divine
hand
considers
god
as
an
avenging
judge
can
not
but
conceive
of
him
as
incensed
against
him
and
hostile
to
him
and
will
therefore
detest
his
scourge
itself
as
a
curse
and
condemnation
in
a
word
he
who
thinks
that
god
is
still
determined
to
punish
him
can
never
be
persuaded
to
believe
himself
an
object
of
the
divine
love
the
only
one
who
receives
any
benefit
from
the
divine
chastisements
is
he
who
considers
god
as
angry
with
his
crimes
but
propitious
and
benevolent
towards
his
person
for
otherwise
the
case
must
necessarily
be
similar
to
what
the
psalmist
complains
of
having
experienced
thy
fierce
wrath
goeth
over
me
thy
terrors
have
cut
me
and
what
moses
also
speaks
of
for
we
are
consumed
by
thine
anger
and
by
thy
wrath
are
we
troubled
thou
hast
set
our
iniquities
before
thee
our
secret
sins
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
for
all
our
days
are
passed
away
in
thy
wrath
we
spend
our
years
as
a
tale
that
is
on
the
contrary
david
speaking
of
his
paternal
chastisements
in
order
to
show
that
believers
are
rather
assisted
than
oppressed
by
them
sings
blessed
is
the
man
whom
thou
chastenest
o
lord
and
teachest
him
out
of
thy
law
that
thou
mayest
give
him
rest
from
the
days
of
adversity
until
the
pit
be
digged
for
the
it
is
certainly
a
severe
temptation
when
the
lord
spares
unbelievers
and
conceals
their
crimes
while
he
appears
more
rigorous
towards
his
own
children
for
their
consolation
therefore
he
adds
the
admonition
of
the
law
whence
they
may
learn
that
it
is
for
the
promotion
of
their
salvation
when
they
are
recalled
into
the
way
but
that
the
impious
are
precipitated
into
their
errors
which
end
in
the
pit
nor
is
it
of
any
importance
whether
the
punishment
be
eternal
or
temporal
for
wars
famines
plagues
and
diseases
are
curses
from
god
as
well
as
the
judgment
of
eternal
death
itself
when
they
are
inflicted
as
the
instruments
of
the
lord
s
wrath
and
vengeance
against
the
reprobate
xxxv
every
one
i
presume
now
perceives
the
design
of
the
lord
s
correction
of
david
that
it
was
to
be
a
proof
of
god
s
extreme
displeasure
against
murder
and
adultery
with
which
he
declared
himself
to
be
so
greatly
offended
in
his
beloved
and
faithful
servant
and
to
teach
david
never
again
to
be
guilty
of
such
crimes
but
not
as
a
punishment
by
which
he
was
to
render
god
a
satisfaction
for
his
offence
and
we
ought
to
form
the
same
judgment
concerning
the
other
correction
in
which
the
lord
afflicted
the
people
with
a
violent
pestilence
on
account
of
the
disobedience
of
david
in
numbering
them
for
he
freely
forgave
david
the
guilt
of
his
sin
but
because
it
was
necessary
as
a
public
example
to
all
ages
and
also
to
the
humiliation
of
david
that
such
an
offence
should
not
remain
unpunished
he
chastised
him
with
extreme
severity
this
end
we
should
keep
in
view
also
in
the
universal
curse
of
mankind
for
since
we
all
even
after
having
obtained
pardon
still
suffer
the
miseries
which
were
inflicted
on
our
first
parent
as
the
punishment
of
sin
we
consider
such
afflictions
as
admonitions
how
grievously
god
is
displeased
with
the
transgression
of
his
law
that
being
thus
dejected
and
humbled
with
a
consciousness
of
our
miserable
condition
we
may
aspire
with
greater
ardour
after
true
blessedness
now
he
is
very
unwise
who
imagines
that
the
calamities
of
the
present
life
are
inflicted
upon
us
as
satisfactions
for
the
guilt
of
sin
this
appears
to
me
to
have
been
the
meaning
of
chrysostom
when
he
said
if
god
therefore
inflicts
punishments
on
us
that
while
we
are
persisting
in
sins
he
may
call
us
to
repentance
a
discovery
of
repentance
the
punishment
will
be
wherefore
he
treats
one
person
with
greater
severity
and
another
with
more
tender
indulgence
as
he
knows
to
be
suitable
to
every
man
s
particular
disposition
therefore
when
he
means
to
suggest
that
he
is
not
excessively
severe
in
the
infliction
of
punishment
he
reproaches
an
obdurate
and
obstinate
people
that
though
they
have
been
corrected
they
have
not
forsaken
their
sins
in
this
sense
he
complains
that
ephraim
is
a
cake
not
turned
that
is
scorched
on
one
side
unbaked
on
the
other
because
his
corrections
did
not
penetrate
the
hearts
of
the
people
so
as
to
expel
their
vices
and
render
them
proper
objects
of
pardon
by
expressing
himself
in
this
manner
he
certainly
gives
us
to
understand
that
as
soon
as
they
shall
have
repented
he
will
be
immediately
appeased
and
that
the
rigour
which
he
exercises
in
chastising
offences
is
extorted
from
him
by
our
obstinacy
but
would
be
prevented
by
a
voluntary
reformation
yet
since
our
obduracy
and
ignorance
are
such
as
universally
to
need
castigation
our
most
wise
father
is
pleased
to
exercise
all
his
children
without
exception
with
the
strokes
of
his
rod
as
long
as
they
live
it
is
astonishing
why
they
fix
their
eyes
thus
on
the
example
of
david
alone
and
are
unaffected
by
so
many
instances
in
which
they
might
behold
a
gratuitous
remission
of
sins
the
publican
is
said
to
have
gone
down
from
the
temple
justified
no
punishment
follows
peter
obtained
the
pardon
of
his
sins
we
read
says
ambrose
of
his
tears
but
not
of
his
and
a
paralytic
hears
the
following
address
be
of
good
cheer
thy
sins
be
forgiven
thee
no
punishment
is
inflicted
all
the
absolutions
which
are
mentioned
in
the
scripture
are
described
as
gratuitous
a
general
rule
ought
rather
to
be
deduced
from
these
numerous
examples
than
from
that
single
case
which
is
attended
with
peculiar
circumstances
xxxvi
when
daniel
exhorted
nebuchadnezzar
to
break
off
his
sins
by
righteousness
and
his
iniquities
by
showing
mercy
to
the
poor
he
meant
not
to
intimate
that
righteousness
and
mercy
propitiate
god
and
atone
for
sins
for
god
forbid
that
there
should
ever
be
any
other
redemption
than
the
blood
of
christ
but
he
used
the
term
with
reference
to
men
rather
than
to
god
as
though
he
had
said
thou
hast
exercised
o
king
an
unrighteous
and
violent
despotism
thou
hast
oppressed
the
weak
thou
hast
plundered
the
poor
thou
hast
treated
thy
people
with
harshness
and
iniquity
instead
of
unjust
exactions
instead
of
violence
and
oppression
now
substitute
mercy
and
in
a
similar
sense
solomon
says
that
love
covereth
all
sins
not
with
reference
to
god
but
among
men
for
the
whole
verse
is
as
follows
hatred
stirreth
up
strifes
but
love
covereth
all
in
which
verse
he
according
to
his
usual
custom
contrasts
the
evils
arising
from
hatred
with
the
fruits
of
love
signifying
that
they
who
hate
each
other
reciprocally
harass
criminate
reproach
revile
and
convert
every
thing
into
a
fault
but
that
they
who
love
one
another
mutually
conceal
connive
at
and
reciprocally
forgive
many
things
among
themselves
not
that
they
approve
each
other
s
faults
but
bear
with
them
and
heal
them
by
admonition
rather
than
aggravate
them
by
invectives
nor
can
we
doubt
that
peter
intended
the
same
in
his
citation
of
this
passage
unless
we
mean
to
accuse
him
of
corrupting
and
craftily
perverting
the
scriptures
when
solomon
says
that
by
mercy
and
truth
iniquity
is
purged
he
intends
not
a
compensation
in
the
divine
view
so
that
god
being
appeased
with
such
a
satisfaction
remits
the
punishment
which
he
would
otherwise
have
inflicted
but
in
the
familiar
manner
of
scripture
he
signifies
that
they
shall
find
him
propitious
to
them
who
have
forsaken
their
former
vices
and
iniquities
and
are
converted
to
him
in
piety
and
truth
as
though
he
had
said
that
the
wrath
of
god
subsides
and
his
judgment
ceases
when
we
cease
from
our
sins
he
describes
not
the
cause
of
pardon
but
the
mode
of
true
conversion
just
as
the
prophets
frequently
declare
that
it
is
in
vain
for
hypocrites
to
offer
to
god
ostentatious
ceremonies
instead
of
repentance
since
he
is
only
pleased
with
integrity
and
the
duties
of
charity
and
as
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
when
he
recommends
us
to
do
good
and
to
communicate
informs
us
that
with
such
sacrifices
god
is
well
and
when
christ
ridicules
the
pharisees
for
having
attended
only
to
the
cleansing
of
dishes
and
neglected
all
purity
of
heart
and
commands
them
to
give
alms
that
all
might
be
clean
he
is
not
exhorting
them
to
make
a
satisfaction
but
only
teaching
them
what
kind
of
purity
obtains
the
divine
approbation
but
of
this
expression
we
have
treated
in
another
work
xxxvii
with
respect
to
the
passage
of
luke
no
one
who
has
read
with
a
sound
judgment
the
parable
the
lord
there
proposes
will
enter
into
any
controversy
with
us
concerning
it
the
pharisee
thought
within
himself
that
the
lord
did
not
know
the
woman
whom
he
had
so
easily
admitted
to
his
presence
for
he
imagined
that
christ
would
not
have
admitted
her
if
he
had
known
what
kind
of
a
sinner
she
was
and
thence
he
inferred
that
christ
who
was
capable
of
being
so
deceived
was
not
a
prophet
to
show
that
she
was
not
a
sinner
her
sins
having
already
been
forgiven
the
lord
proposed
this
parable
there
was
a
certain
creditor
which
had
two
debtors
the
one
owed
five
hundred
pence
and
the
other
fifty
he
frankly
forgave
them
both
which
of
them
will
love
him
most
the
pharisee
answered
he
to
whom
he
forgave
the
lord
rejoins
hence
know
that
this
woman
s
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
for
she
loved
in
these
words
you
see
he
makes
her
love
not
the
cause
of
the
remission
of
her
sins
but
the
proof
of
it
for
they
are
taken
from
a
comparison
of
that
debtor
to
whom
five
hundred
pence
had
been
forgiven
of
whom
it
is
said
not
that
his
debt
was
forgiven
because
he
had
loved
much
but
that
he
loved
much
because
his
debt
had
been
forgiven
and
this
similitude
may
be
applied
to
the
case
of
the
woman
in
the
following
manner
you
suppose
this
woman
to
be
a
sinner
but
you
ought
to
know
that
she
is
not
such
since
her
sins
are
forgiven
her
and
her
love
ought
to
convince
you
of
the
remission
of
her
sins
by
the
grateful
return
she
makes
for
this
it
is
an
argumentum
by
which
any
thing
is
proved
from
its
consequences
by
what
means
she
obtained
remission
of
sins
the
lord
plainly
declares
thy
faith
says
he
hath
saved
by
faith
therefore
we
obtain
remission
by
love
we
give
thanks
and
declare
the
goodness
of
the
lord
xxxviii
to
those
things
which
frequently
occur
in
the
works
of
the
fathers
concerning
i
pay
little
regard
i
see
indeed
that
some
of
them
or
to
speak
plainly
almost
all
whose
writings
are
extant
have
either
erred
on
this
point
or
expressed
themselves
too
harshly
but
i
shall
not
admit
that
they
were
so
ignorant
and
inexperienced
as
to
write
those
things
in
the
sense
in
which
they
are
understood
by
the
modern
advocates
for
satisfaction
chrysostom
somewhere
expresses
himself
thus
where
mercy
is
requested
examination
ceases
where
mercy
is
implored
judgment
is
not
severe
where
mercy
is
sought
there
is
no
room
for
punishment
where
there
is
mercy
there
is
no
inquiry
where
mercy
is
an
answer
is
freely
these
expressions
however
they
may
be
distorted
can
never
be
reconciled
with
the
dogmas
of
the
schools
in
the
treatise
on
ecclesiastical
doctrines
which
is
ascribed
to
augustine
we
read
the
following
passage
the
satisfaction
of
repentance
is
to
cut
off
the
causes
of
sins
and
not
to
indulge
an
entrance
to
their
whence
it
appears
that
even
in
those
times
the
doctrine
of
satisfaction
as
a
compensation
for
sins
committed
was
universally
rejected
since
he
refers
all
satisfaction
to
a
cautious
abstinence
from
sins
in
future
i
will
not
quote
what
is
further
asserted
by
chrysostom
that
the
lord
requires
of
us
nothing
more
than
to
confess
our
sins
before
him
with
tears
for
passages
of
this
kind
frequently
occur
in
his
writings
and
in
those
of
other
fathers
augustine
somewhere
calls
works
of
mercy
remedies
for
obtaining
remission
of
sins
but
lest
any
one
should
stumble
at
that
expression
he
explains
himself
more
fully
in
another
place
the
flesh
of
christ
says
he
is
the
true
and
sole
sacrifice
for
sins
not
only
for
those
which
are
all
obliterated
in
baptism
but
also
for
those
which
afterwards
creep
in
through
infirmity
on
account
of
which
the
whole
church
at
present
exclaims
forgive
us
our
debts
and
they
are
forgiven
through
that
single
xxxix
but
they
most
commonly
used
the
word
satisfaction
to
signify
not
a
compensation
rendered
to
god
but
a
public
testification
by
which
those
who
had
been
punished
with
excommunication
when
they
wished
to
be
readmitted
to
communion
gave
the
church
an
assurance
of
their
repentance
for
there
were
enjoined
on
those
penitents
certain
fastings
and
other
observances
by
which
they
might
prove
themselves
truly
and
cordially
weary
of
their
former
life
or
rather
obliterate
the
memory
of
their
past
actions
and
thus
they
were
said
to
make
satisfaction
not
to
god
but
to
the
church
this
is
also
expressed
by
augustine
in
these
very
words
in
his
enchiridion
ad
laurentium
from
that
ancient
custom
have
originated
the
confessions
and
satisfactions
which
are
used
in
the
present
age
a
viperous
brood
which
retain
not
even
the
shadow
of
that
original
form
i
know
that
the
fathers
sometimes
express
themselves
rather
harshly
nor
do
i
deny
what
i
have
just
asserted
that
perhaps
they
have
erred
but
their
writings
which
were
only
besprinkled
with
a
few
spots
after
they
have
been
handled
by
such
foul
hands
became
thoroughly
soiled
and
if
we
must
contend
with
the
authority
of
fathers
what
fathers
do
they
obtrude
upon
us
most
of
those
passages
of
which
lombard
their
champion
has
compiled
his
heterogeneous
collection
are
extracted
from
the
insipid
reveries
of
some
monks
which
are
circulated
under
the
names
of
ambrose
jerome
augustine
and
chrysostom
thus
on
the
present
argument
he
borrows
almost
every
thing
from
a
treatise
on
repentance
which
is
a
ridiculous
selection
from
various
authors
good
and
bad
it
bears
the
name
of
augustine
indeed
but
no
man
even
of
moderate
learning
can
deign
to
admit
it
as
really
his
for
not
entering
into
a
more
particular
examination
of
their
absurdities
i
request
the
pardon
of
the
reader
whom
i
wish
to
spare
that
trouble
it
would
be
both
easy
and
plausible
for
me
to
expose
to
the
greatest
contempt
what
they
have
heretofore
celebrated
as
mysteries
but
i
forbear
as
my
object
is
to
write
what
may
tend
to
edification
chapter
indulgences
and
purgatory
the
supplements
to
their
doctrine
of
satisfactions
this
doctrine
of
has
given
rise
to
for
by
indulgences
they
pretend
that
the
deficiency
of
our
abilities
to
make
satisfaction
is
supplied
and
even
proceed
to
the
extravagance
of
defining
them
to
be
the
dispensation
of
the
merits
of
christ
and
of
the
martyrs
which
the
pope
distributes
in
his
bulls
now
though
such
persons
are
fitter
subjects
for
a
than
for
arguments
so
that
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
engage
in
refuting
errors
so
frivolous
which
have
been
shaken
by
many
attacks
and
begin
of
themselves
to
grow
obsolete
and
totter
towards
a
fall
yet
as
a
brief
refutation
will
be
useful
to
some
minds
hitherto
uninformed
on
the
subject
i
shall
not
altogether
omit
it
and
indeed
the
establishment
and
long
continuance
of
indulgences
with
the
unlimited
influence
retained
by
them
amidst
such
outrageous
and
furious
licentiousness
may
serve
to
convince
us
in
what
a
deep
night
of
errors
men
were
immersed
for
several
ages
they
saw
that
they
were
themselves
objects
of
the
public
and
undissembled
ridicule
of
the
pope
and
the
dispensers
of
his
bulls
that
lucrative
bargains
were
made
concerning
the
salvation
of
their
souls
that
the
price
of
salvation
was
fixed
at
a
trifling
sum
of
money
and
nothing
presented
gratuitously
that
under
this
pretext
contributions
were
extorted
from
them
which
were
vilely
consumed
on
brothels
pimps
and
revellings
that
the
greatest
advocates
of
indulgences
were
the
greatest
despisers
of
them
that
this
monster
was
daily
making
longer
strides
in
licentious
power
and
luxury
and
that
there
was
no
end
that
more
trash
was
continually
produced
and
more
money
continually
extorted
yet
they
received
indulgences
with
the
greatest
veneration
adored
them
and
purchased
them
and
those
who
had
more
discernment
than
others
yet
considered
them
as
pious
frauds
by
which
they
might
be
deceived
with
some
advantage
at
length
since
the
world
has
permitted
itself
to
recover
a
little
the
exercise
of
reason
indulgences
become
more
and
more
discredited
till
they
altogether
disappear
ii
but
since
many
who
see
the
pollution
imposture
robbery
and
rapacity
with
which
the
dispensers
of
indulgences
have
hitherto
amused
themselves
and
cajoled
us
do
not
perceive
the
fountain
of
all
this
impiety
will
be
necessary
to
show
not
only
the
nature
of
indulgences
as
commonly
used
but
what
they
are
in
themselves
when
abstracted
from
every
adventitious
blemish
the
merits
of
christ
and
of
the
holy
apostles
and
martyrs
they
style
the
treasury
of
the
the
principal
custody
of
this
repository
they
pretend
to
have
been
delivered
as
i
have
already
hinted
to
the
bishop
of
rome
who
has
the
dispensation
of
such
great
benefits
so
that
he
can
both
bestow
them
himself
and
delegate
the
power
of
bestowing
them
to
others
hence
from
the
pope
are
received
sometimes
plenary
indulgences
sometimes
indulgences
for
a
certain
number
of
years
from
cardinals
for
a
hundred
days
from
bishops
for
forty
days
but
to
describe
them
correctly
they
are
a
profanation
of
the
blood
of
christ
and
a
delusion
of
satan
by
which
they
seduce
christians
from
the
grace
of
god
and
the
life
which
is
in
christ
and
turn
them
aside
from
the
right
way
of
salvation
for
how
could
the
blood
of
christ
be
more
basely
profaned
than
when
it
is
denied
to
be
sufficient
for
the
remission
of
sins
for
reconciliation
and
satisfaction
unless
its
deficiency
be
supplied
from
some
other
quarter
to
him
says
peter
give
all
the
prophets
witness
that
through
his
name
whosoever
believeth
on
him
shall
receive
remission
of
indulgences
dispense
remission
of
sins
through
peter
and
paul
and
the
martyrs
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
says
john
cleanseth
us
from
all
indulgences
make
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
the
ablution
of
sins
paul
says
that
christ
who
knew
no
sin
was
made
sin
for
us
that
is
a
satisfaction
for
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
indulgences
place
satisfaction
for
sins
in
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
paul
declared
to
the
corinthians
that
christ
alone
was
crucified
and
died
for
them
indulgences
pronounce
that
paul
and
others
died
for
us
in
another
place
he
says
that
christ
hath
purchased
the
church
with
his
own
indulgences
assign
another
price
of
this
purchase
in
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
the
apostle
says
that
by
one
offering
christ
hath
perfected
for
ever
them
that
are
indulgences
on
the
contrary
proclaim
that
sanctification
which
were
otherwise
insufficient
receives
its
perfection
from
the
martyrs
john
declares
that
all
saints
have
washed
their
robes
in
the
blood
of
the
indulgences
teach
us
to
wash
our
robes
in
the
blood
of
the
saints
iii
leo
bishop
of
rome
excellently
opposes
these
sacrilegious
pretensions
in
his
epistle
to
the
bishops
of
palestine
although
the
death
of
many
saints
he
says
has
been
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
yet
the
murder
of
no
innocent
person
has
been
the
propitiation
of
the
world
the
righteous
have
received
not
bestowed
crowns
and
from
the
fortitude
of
the
faithful
have
arisen
examples
of
patience
not
gifts
of
righteousness
for
their
deaths
have
been
all
singular
nor
has
any
one
by
his
death
discharged
the
debt
of
another
for
it
is
the
lord
christ
alone
in
whom
all
are
crucified
dead
buried
and
raised
from
the
this
passage
being
worthy
of
remembrance
he
repeats
it
in
another
place
surely
nothing
clearer
can
be
desired
in
confutation
of
this
impious
doctrine
of
indulgences
and
augustine
expresses
himself
with
equal
propriety
to
the
same
purpose
he
says
although
we
die
brethren
for
brethren
yet
the
blood
of
no
martyr
is
ever
shed
for
the
remission
of
sins
christ
has
done
this
for
us
and
in
doing
it
has
not
given
an
example
in
which
we
should
imitate
him
but
conferred
a
favour
for
which
we
should
thank
again
in
another
place
as
the
son
of
god
alone
became
the
son
of
man
to
make
us
with
himself
sons
of
god
so
he
alone
without
any
demerits
sustained
the
punishment
for
us
that
we
without
any
merits
might
through
him
obtain
undeserved
indeed
whilst
their
whole
doctrine
is
a
compound
of
horrible
sacrilege
and
blasphemies
yet
this
is
a
blasphemy
more
monstrous
than
the
rest
let
them
acknowledge
whether
these
be
not
their
opinions
that
the
martyrs
have
by
their
death
performed
for
god
and
merited
from
him
more
than
was
necessary
for
themselves
that
they
had
so
great
a
redundance
of
merits
as
to
superabound
to
others
that
therefore
lest
so
great
a
blessing
should
be
superfluous
their
blood
is
commingled
with
the
blood
of
christ
and
that
of
both
these
is
formed
the
treasury
of
the
church
for
the
remission
and
expiation
of
sins
and
that
in
this
sense
we
ought
to
understand
the
declaration
of
paul
i
fill
up
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
in
my
flesh
for
his
body
s
sake
which
is
the
what
is
this
but
leaving
christ
a
mere
name
and
in
other
respects
making
him
an
inferior
saint
of
the
common
order
scarcely
distinguishable
among
the
multitude
he
alone
ought
to
have
been
preached
he
alone
exhibited
he
alone
mentioned
he
alone
regarded
in
all
discourses
on
the
procurement
of
remission
of
sins
expiation
and
sanctification
but
let
us
hear
their
grand
argument
that
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
may
not
be
shed
in
vain
let
it
be
applied
to
the
common
benefit
of
the
church
indeed
was
it
no
advantage
to
glorify
god
by
their
death
to
subscribe
to
his
truth
with
their
blood
to
testify
by
their
contempt
of
the
present
life
that
they
sought
a
better
one
by
their
constancy
to
confirm
the
faith
of
the
church
and
vanquish
the
obstinacy
of
their
enemies
but
this
is
the
fact
they
acknowledge
no
benefit
if
christ
alone
be
the
propitiator
if
he
alone
died
for
our
sins
if
he
alone
was
offered
for
our
redemption
peter
and
paul
they
say
might
nevertheless
have
obtained
the
crown
of
victory
if
they
had
expired
in
their
beds
but
since
they
contended
even
to
blood
it
would
be
incompatible
with
the
justice
of
god
to
leave
this
or
as
if
god
knew
not
how
to
augment
the
glory
of
his
servants
according
to
the
extent
of
his
gifts
but
the
church
in
general
receives
an
advantage
sufficiently
great
when
by
their
triumphs
it
is
inflamed
with
the
same
zeal
for
similar
exertions
and
conflicts
iv
but
how
maliciously
they
pervert
that
passage
of
paul
where
he
says
that
he
fills
up
in
his
own
flesh
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
for
he
refers
that
deficiency
and
supplement
not
to
the
work
of
redemption
satisfaction
or
expiation
but
to
those
afflictions
with
which
the
members
of
christ
even
all
the
faithful
must
necessarily
be
exercised
as
long
as
they
live
in
the
present
state
he
says
therefore
that
this
remains
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
that
having
once
suffered
in
himself
he
daily
suffers
in
his
members
christ
honors
us
so
far
as
to
consider
our
afflictions
as
his
when
paul
adds
that
he
suffered
for
the
church
he
means
not
for
the
redemption
reconciliation
or
atonement
of
the
church
but
for
its
edification
and
profit
as
in
another
place
he
says
i
endure
all
things
for
the
elect
s
sakes
that
they
may
also
obtain
the
salvation
which
is
in
christ
he
writes
to
the
corinthians
that
whatever
tribulations
he
endured
he
was
afflicted
for
their
consolation
and
and
he
immediately
proceeds
to
explain
himself
by
adding
that
he
was
made
a
minister
of
the
church
not
for
its
redemption
but
according
to
the
dispensation
which
had
been
committed
to
him
to
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
but
if
they
require
also
another
expositor
let
them
attend
to
augustine
the
sufferings
of
christ
says
he
are
in
christ
alone
as
in
the
head
in
christ
and
the
church
as
in
the
whole
body
whence
paul
one
of
the
members
says
i
fill
up
in
my
flesh
that
which
is
behind
of
the
afflictions
of
christ
if
you
therefore
whoever
you
are
that
read
this
are
one
of
the
members
of
christ
all
that
you
suffer
from
such
as
are
not
members
of
christ
was
behind
in
the
afflictions
of
but
the
tendency
of
the
sufferings
of
the
apostles
sustained
on
account
of
the
church
is
stated
by
him
in
another
place
christ
is
my
door
to
you
because
you
are
the
sheep
of
christ
purchased
with
his
blood
acknowledge
your
price
which
is
not
given
by
me
but
preached
by
then
he
adds
as
he
has
laid
down
his
life
so
we
ought
also
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
brethren
for
the
establishment
of
peace
and
the
confirmation
of
this
is
the
language
of
augustine
but
let
it
not
be
imagined
that
paul
thought
there
was
any
deficiency
in
the
sufferings
of
christ
with
respect
to
all
the
plenitude
of
righteousness
salvation
and
life
or
that
any
addition
to
them
was
intended
by
him
who
so
clearly
and
magnificently
proclaims
that
the
abundance
of
grace
by
christ
was
poured
forth
with
such
liberality
that
it
much
more
abounded
beyond
all
the
aboundings
of
sin
it
is
not
by
the
merit
of
their
own
life
or
death
but
by
this
grace
alone
that
all
the
saints
have
been
saved
as
peter
expressly
testifies
so
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
an
injurious
contempt
of
god
and
of
his
christ
who
should
place
the
worthiness
of
any
saint
in
any
thing
else
but
the
mere
mercy
of
god
but
why
do
i
dwell
any
longer
on
this
subject
as
though
it
were
still
involved
in
obscurity
whereas
the
statement
of
such
monstrous
notions
is
of
itself
a
complete
refutation
of
them
now
to
pass
from
such
abominations
who
taught
the
pope
to
enclose
in
lead
and
parchment
the
grace
of
jesus
christ
which
the
lord
designed
to
be
dispensed
by
the
word
of
the
gospel
either
the
gospel
of
god
must
be
false
or
their
indulgences
fallacious
for
that
christ
is
offered
to
us
in
the
gospel
with
all
his
plenitude
of
heavenly
blessings
with
all
his
merits
with
all
his
righteousness
wisdom
and
grace
without
any
exception
is
testified
by
paul
when
he
says
god
hath
committed
unto
us
the
word
of
reconciliation
now
then
we
are
ambassadors
for
christ
as
though
god
did
beseech
you
by
us
we
pray
you
in
christ
s
stead
be
ye
reconciled
to
god
for
he
hath
made
him
who
knew
no
sin
to
be
sin
for
us
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
and
believers
know
the
meaning
of
that
fellowship
of
christ
which
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
same
apostle
is
offered
to
our
enjoyment
in
the
gospel
indulgences
on
the
contrary
produce
a
certain
allowance
of
grace
from
the
pope
s
repository
fix
it
to
lead
and
parchment
and
even
to
a
particular
place
and
separate
it
from
the
word
of
god
now
if
any
one
inquire
the
origin
of
this
abuse
it
seems
to
have
arisen
from
an
ancient
custom
that
when
more
severe
satisfactions
were
imposed
on
penitents
than
could
possibly
be
borne
by
all
they
who
felt
themselves
oppressed
beyond
measure
petitioned
the
church
for
some
relaxation
of
rigour
the
remission
granted
to
such
persons
was
called
indulgence
but
when
they
transferred
satisfactions
to
god
and
said
that
they
were
compensations
by
which
men
might
redeem
themselves
from
the
judgment
of
god
they
also
converted
these
indulgences
into
expiatory
remedies
to
deliver
us
from
deserved
punishments
but
the
blasphemies
which
we
have
mentioned
have
been
fabricated
with
such
consummate
impudence
that
they
have
not
even
the
least
appearance
of
plausibility
vi
nor
let
them
now
trouble
us
any
more
about
their
purgatory
since
it
is
utterly
demolished
by
this
argument
for
i
can
not
coincide
with
some
who
think
it
best
to
be
silent
on
this
point
and
to
omit
the
mention
of
purgatory
from
which
they
say
many
sharp
contentions
arise
but
very
little
edification
results
indeed
i
should
myself
be
of
opinion
that
such
trifles
are
unworthy
of
notice
if
they
did
not
consider
them
as
matters
of
importance
but
since
purgatory
has
been
erected
with
a
multitude
of
blasphemies
and
is
daily
propped
by
new
ones
and
since
it
excites
many
and
grievous
offences
it
really
must
not
pass
without
notice
it
might
be
possible
for
a
time
to
conceal
that
it
was
a
fiction
of
curious
and
presumptuous
temerity
unsupported
by
the
word
of
god
that
it
was
accredited
by
i
know
not
what
revelation
invented
by
the
subtlety
of
satan
that
for
its
confirmation
some
passages
of
scripture
were
absurdly
perverted
the
lord
however
suffers
not
human
presumption
thus
violently
to
break
into
the
hidden
recesses
of
his
judgment
and
has
severely
prohibited
the
neglect
of
his
word
and
the
inquiry
after
truth
among
the
dead
and
does
not
permit
his
word
to
be
thus
irreverently
dishonoured
nevertheless
admitting
that
all
these
things
might
for
a
short
time
have
been
tolerated
as
matters
of
small
importance
yet
when
expiation
of
sins
is
sought
any
where
but
in
the
blood
of
christ
when
satisfaction
is
transferred
to
any
other
silence
becomes
dangerous
in
the
extreme
therefore
we
should
exclaim
with
all
our
might
that
purgatory
is
a
pernicious
fiction
of
satan
that
it
makes
void
the
cross
of
christ
that
it
intolerably
insults
the
divine
mercy
and
weakens
and
overturns
our
faith
for
what
is
their
purgatory
but
a
satisfaction
for
sins
paid
after
death
by
the
souls
of
the
deceased
thus
the
notion
of
satisfaction
being
overthrown
purgatory
itself
is
immediately
subverted
from
its
very
foundations
but
if
it
has
been
fully
evinced
that
the
blood
of
christ
is
the
only
satisfaction
expiation
and
purgation
for
the
sins
of
the
faithful
what
is
the
necessary
inference
but
that
purgatory
is
nothing
but
a
horrible
blasphemy
against
christ
i
pass
by
the
sacrilegious
pretences
with
which
it
is
daily
defended
the
offences
which
it
produces
in
religion
and
the
other
innumerable
evils
which
we
perceive
to
have
proceeded
from
such
a
source
of
impiety
vii
it
is
worth
while
however
to
wrest
out
of
their
hands
those
passages
of
scripture
which
they
have
falsely
and
corruptly
pressed
into
their
service
the
assertion
of
the
lord
that
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
neither
in
this
world
neither
in
the
world
to
come
implies
they
say
that
there
is
a
forgiveness
of
some
sins
in
the
world
to
come
but
who
does
not
see
that
the
lord
there
speaks
of
the
guilt
of
sin
and
if
this
be
the
case
what
has
it
to
do
with
their
purgatory
for
there
they
suppose
punishment
to
be
inflicted
for
sins
the
guilt
of
which
they
do
not
deny
to
have
been
forgiven
in
the
present
life
but
to
prevent
all
further
cavils
they
shall
have
a
plainer
answer
when
the
lord
intended
to
cut
off
from
such
flagitious
iniquity
all
hope
of
pardon
he
thought
it
not
sufficient
to
say
that
it
should
never
be
forgiven
but
for
the
sake
of
further
amplification
he
adopted
a
distinction
comprehending
both
the
judgment
which
the
conscience
of
every
individual
feels
in
this
life
and
that
final
judgment
which
will
be
publicly
held
at
the
resurrection
as
though
he
had
said
beware
of
malicious
rebellion
as
of
immediate
perdition
for
he
who
shall
have
purposely
endeavoured
to
extinguish
the
offered
light
of
the
spirit
shall
never
obtain
pardon
neither
in
this
life
which
is
allotted
to
sinners
for
their
conversion
nor
in
the
last
day
when
the
lambs
shall
be
separated
from
the
goats
by
the
angels
of
god
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
shall
be
purged
from
every
they
next
adduce
this
parable
from
matthew
agree
with
thine
adversary
lest
at
any
time
the
adversary
deliver
thee
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
deliver
thee
to
the
officer
and
thou
be
cast
into
prison
thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence
till
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
if
in
this
place
the
judge
signify
god
the
adversary
the
devil
the
officer
an
angel
the
prison
purgatory
i
will
readily
submit
to
them
but
if
it
be
evident
to
every
one
that
christ
there
intended
to
show
to
how
many
dangers
and
calamities
persons
exposed
themselves
who
prefer
obstinately
exerting
the
rigour
of
the
law
to
acting
upon
the
principles
of
equity
and
kindness
in
order
the
more
earnestly
to
exhort
his
disciples
to
an
equitable
concord
pray
where
will
purgatory
be
found
viii
they
derive
an
argument
from
the
language
of
paul
where
he
has
affirmed
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
bow
of
things
in
heaven
and
things
in
earth
and
things
under
the
for
they
assume
it
as
granted
that
things
or
persons
under
the
earth
can
not
be
understood
of
those
who
are
consigned
to
eternal
damnation
it
follows
therefore
that
they
must
be
the
souls
suffering
in
purgatory
their
reasoning
would
not
be
very
bad
if
by
genuflection
the
apostle
designed
truly
pious
worship
but
since
he
simply
teaches
that
dominion
is
committed
to
christ
by
which
all
creatures
must
be
subjugated
why
may
we
not
understand
this
phrase
of
the
devils
who
will
indeed
stand
at
the
tribunal
of
the
lord
and
acknowledge
him
as
their
judge
with
fear
and
trembling
as
paul
himself
elsewhere
explains
the
same
prophecy
we
shall
all
stand
says
he
before
the
judgment
seat
of
christ
for
it
is
written
as
i
live
saith
the
lord
every
knee
shall
bow
to
me
but
they
reply
we
can
not
give
the
same
kind
of
interpretation
to
this
passage
in
the
revelation
every
creature
which
is
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
such
as
are
in
the
sea
and
all
that
are
in
them
heard
i
saying
blessing
and
honour
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
this
i
readily
concede
but
what
creatures
do
they
suppose
to
be
here
enumerated
for
it
is
very
certain
that
the
expressions
comprehend
creatures
both
irrational
and
inanimate
it
is
a
mere
declaration
that
all
the
parts
of
the
world
from
the
summit
of
the
heavens
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
celebrate
in
their
respective
ways
the
glory
of
the
creator
what
they
produce
from
the
history
of
the
maccabees
i
shall
not
honour
with
an
answer
that
i
may
not
be
supposed
to
place
that
work
in
the
catalogue
of
sacred
books
but
augustine
they
say
received
it
as
canonical
i
inquire
first
with
what
degree
of
credit
did
he
receive
it
he
says
the
history
of
the
maccabees
is
not
esteemed
by
the
jews
as
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
the
psalms
to
which
the
lord
gives
a
testimony
as
being
witnesses
concerning
him
saying
all
things
must
be
fulfilled
which
were
written
in
the
law
of
moses
and
in
the
prophets
and
in
the
psalms
concerning
but
it
has
been
received
by
the
church
and
not
altogether
unprofitably
if
it
be
read
or
heard
with
sobriety
jerome
without
any
scruple
inculcates
that
its
authority
is
of
no
force
in
the
support
of
doctrines
and
from
that
old
treatise
on
the
exposition
of
the
creed
which
is
ascribed
to
cyprian
it
clearly
appears
that
it
was
not
admitted
in
the
ancient
church
but
why
am
i
now
contending
to
no
purpose
as
though
the
author
himself
did
not
sufficiently
show
what
deference
is
due
to
him
when
at
the
conclusion
he
begs
pardon
if
he
should
have
spoken
any
thing
improperly
certainly
he
who
confesses
that
his
writings
need
pardon
proclaims
them
not
to
be
the
oracles
of
the
holy
spirit
besides
the
piety
of
judas
maccabeus
is
commended
on
no
other
ground
but
because
he
had
a
firm
hope
of
the
final
resurrection
when
he
sent
to
jerusalem
an
oblation
for
the
dead
nor
does
the
historian
represent
this
oblation
as
intended
to
be
a
price
of
redemption
but
that
those
in
whose
names
it
was
offered
might
be
partakers
of
eternal
life
with
the
rest
of
the
faithful
who
had
died
in
defence
of
their
country
and
religion
this
action
was
accompanied
indeed
by
superstition
and
preposterous
zeal
but
they
are
more
than
infatuated
who
apply
to
us
a
sacrifice
offered
under
the
law
since
we
know
that
all
such
ancient
usages
ceased
at
the
advent
of
christ
ix
but
they
find
in
paul
an
invincible
argument
which
can
not
be
so
easily
answered
if
any
man
says
he
build
upon
this
foundation
gold
silver
precious
stones
wood
hay
stubble
every
man
s
work
shall
be
made
manifest
for
the
day
shall
declare
it
because
it
shall
be
revealed
by
fire
and
the
fire
shall
try
every
man
s
work
of
what
sort
it
is
if
any
man
s
work
shall
be
burned
he
shall
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
what
can
this
be
they
ask
but
purgatorial
fire
by
which
the
pollution
of
sins
is
cleansed
that
we
may
enter
pure
into
the
kingdom
of
god
but
most
of
the
fathers
were
of
a
different
opinion
understanding
the
word
fire
to
mean
tribulation
or
the
cross
by
which
the
lord
tries
his
children
to
purify
them
from
all
carnal
pollution
and
this
is
much
more
probable
than
the
notion
of
purgatory
i
can
not
however
coincide
with
them
for
i
think
i
have
discovered
a
far
more
certain
and
lucid
interpretation
of
this
passage
but
before
i
state
it
i
could
wish
them
to
answer
this
they
suppose
it
was
necessary
for
the
apostles
and
all
the
saints
to
pass
through
this
purgatorial
fire
i
know
they
will
answer
in
the
negative
for
it
were
too
absurd
that
purification
should
be
necessary
to
those
whose
redundant
merits
they
vainly
imagine
to
superabound
to
all
the
members
of
the
church
but
the
apostle
affirms
this
for
he
says
not
that
the
work
of
some
but
that
the
work
of
all
shall
be
proved
nor
is
this
my
own
argument
but
augustine
s
who
thus
opposes
the
interpretation
now
adopted
by
our
adversaries
and
what
would
be
still
more
absurd
he
says
not
that
they
shall
pass
through
the
fire
on
account
of
any
works
but
that
if
they
have
edified
the
church
with
perfect
fidelity
they
shall
receive
a
reward
when
their
work
shall
have
been
tried
by
fire
in
the
first
place
we
see
that
the
apostle
uses
a
metaphor
when
he
calls
doctrines
of
human
invention
wood
hay
the
reason
of
the
metaphor
also
is
evident
that
as
wood
immediately
on
being
placed
in
contact
with
fire
consumes
and
wastes
away
so
neither
will
those
doctrines
be
able
to
abide
the
test
of
examination
now
it
is
well
known
that
such
an
examination
proceeds
from
the
spirit
of
god
therefore
to
pursue
the
thread
of
the
metaphor
and
to
adapt
the
parts
by
a
proper
relation
to
each
other
he
gives
the
holy
spirit
s
examination
the
appellation
of
for
as
gold
and
silver
afford
a
more
certain
proof
of
their
goodness
and
purity
in
proportion
to
their
proximity
to
the
fire
so
divine
truth
receives
the
stronger
confirmation
of
its
authority
in
proportion
to
the
strictness
of
spiritual
examination
by
which
it
is
investigated
as
wood
hay
and
stubble
brought
into
contact
with
fire
are
speedily
consumed
so
the
inventions
of
men
unsupported
by
the
word
of
god
can
not
bear
the
examination
of
the
holy
spirit
but
must
immediately
fall
to
the
ground
finally
if
false
doctrines
are
compared
to
wood
hay
and
stubble
because
like
wood
hay
and
stubble
they
are
consumed
by
fire
and
entirely
destroyed
and
if
they
are
overcome
only
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
it
follows
that
the
spirit
is
that
fire
by
which
they
will
be
proved
this
trial
paul
calls
or
day
of
the
according
to
the
common
phraseology
of
scripture
for
that
is
called
the
day
of
the
lord
whenever
he
manifests
his
presence
to
men
now
we
enjoy
most
of
the
light
of
his
countenance
when
we
are
favoured
with
the
radiance
of
his
truth
it
has
been
evinced
that
paul
means
no
other
fire
than
the
examination
of
the
holy
spirit
but
how
are
they
saved
by
the
fire
who
suffer
the
loss
of
their
work
this
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
comprehend
if
we
consider
of
what
class
of
men
he
is
speaking
for
he
characterizes
them
as
builders
of
the
church
who
retain
their
legitimate
foundation
but
raise
the
superstructure
of
unequal
materials
they
are
such
as
do
not
deviate
from
the
principal
and
essential
articles
of
the
faith
but
err
in
inferior
and
less
important
ones
mixing
their
own
inventions
with
the
word
of
god
such
i
say
must
suffer
the
loss
of
their
work
by
their
inventions
being
destroyed
but
they
are
themselves
saved
yet
so
as
by
fire
that
is
not
because
their
ignorance
and
error
can
be
approved
by
the
lord
but
because
they
are
purified
from
them
by
the
grace
and
power
of
the
holy
spirit
wherefore
whoever
have
corrupted
the
pure
gold
of
the
divine
word
with
this
filth
of
purgatory
must
necessarily
suffer
the
loss
of
their
work
x
our
opponents
will
reply
that
it
has
been
a
very
ancient
opinion
in
the
church
paul
removes
this
objection
when
he
comprehends
even
his
own
age
in
this
sentence
where
he
denounces
that
all
must
suffer
the
loss
of
their
work
who
in
the
structure
of
the
church
should
place
any
thing
not
corresponding
to
the
foundation
when
our
adversaries
therefore
object
to
me
that
to
offer
prayers
for
the
dead
has
been
the
practice
of
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
i
inquire
of
them
on
the
contrary
by
what
word
of
god
by
what
revelation
by
what
example
it
is
sanctioned
for
they
are
not
only
destitute
of
any
testimonies
of
scripture
in
favour
of
it
but
none
of
the
examples
of
the
saints
there
recorded
exhibit
any
thing
like
it
respecting
mourning
and
funeral
offices
it
contains
many
and
sometimes
long
accounts
but
of
prayers
for
persons
deceased
you
can
not
discover
the
smallest
hint
but
the
greater
the
importance
of
the
subject
so
much
the
rather
ought
it
to
have
been
particularly
mentioned
even
the
fathers
themselves
who
offered
up
prayers
for
the
dead
saw
that
they
had
neither
a
divine
command
nor
a
legitimate
example
to
justify
the
practice
why
then
did
they
presume
to
adopt
it
in
this
i
say
they
discovered
themselves
to
be
but
men
and
therefore
i
contend
that
what
they
did
ought
not
to
be
enforced
for
the
imitation
of
others
for
since
believers
ought
not
to
undertake
any
thing
without
an
assurance
of
conscience
according
to
the
direction
of
paul
this
assurance
is
chiefly
requisite
in
prayer
yet
it
will
be
urged
it
is
probable
that
they
were
impelled
to
it
by
some
reason
i
reply
perhaps
they
sought
some
consolation
to
alleviate
their
sorrow
and
it
might
appear
inhuman
not
to
give
some
testimony
of
their
love
towards
the
dead
in
the
presence
of
god
the
propensity
of
the
human
mind
to
this
affection
all
men
know
by
experience
the
custom
also
when
received
was
like
a
flame
kindling
ardour
in
the
minds
of
multitudes
we
know
that
funeral
rites
have
been
performed
to
the
dead
among
all
nations
and
in
every
age
and
that
lustrations
have
been
annually
made
for
their
departed
spirits
for
though
satan
has
deluded
foolish
mortals
with
these
fallacies
yet
he
has
borrowed
the
occasion
of
the
deception
from
a
true
death
is
not
an
annihilation
but
a
transition
from
this
life
into
another
nor
can
it
be
doubted
but
that
even
superstition
itself
convicts
the
heathen
before
the
tribunal
of
god
for
neglecting
all
the
concerns
of
a
future
life
which
they
professed
to
believe
now
christians
because
they
would
not
be
inferior
to
the
heathen
were
ashamed
to
perform
no
services
for
the
dead
as
though
they
had
wholly
ceased
to
exist
hence
that
inconsiderate
officiousness
because
if
they
were
negligent
in
attending
to
funerals
feasts
and
oblations
they
were
afraid
they
should
expose
themselves
to
great
disgrace
what
first
proceeded
from
a
perverse
emulation
has
been
so
repeatedly
augmented
by
novel
additions
that
the
principal
sanctity
of
popery
consists
in
relieving
the
distresses
of
the
dead
but
the
scripture
administers
another
consolation
far
better
and
more
substantial
when
it
declares
that
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
and
adds
as
a
reason
that
they
may
rest
from
their
but
we
ought
not
to
indulge
our
own
affection
so
far
as
to
introduce
a
corrupt
method
of
praying
into
the
church
certainly
he
that
has
but
a
moderate
share
of
penetration
will
easily
discover
all
that
we
find
on
this
subject
in
the
fathers
to
have
been
in
compliance
with
general
practice
and
vulgar
ignorance
i
confess
they
were
also
involved
in
the
error
themselves
from
an
inconsiderate
credulity
which
frequently
deprives
the
human
mind
of
its
judgment
but
in
the
mean
time
the
mere
reading
of
them
demonstrates
with
what
hesitation
they
recommend
prayers
for
the
dead
augustine
in
his
book
of
confessions
relates
that
monica
his
mother
had
vehemently
entreated
to
be
remembered
in
the
celebration
of
the
mysteries
at
the
altar
this
was
the
wish
of
an
old
woman
which
her
son
did
not
examine
by
the
standard
of
scripture
but
from
his
natural
affection
for
her
wished
it
to
gain
the
approbation
of
others
but
the
treatise
composed
by
him
on
care
for
the
dead
contains
so
many
hesitations
that
it
ought
by
its
coolness
to
extinguish
the
heat
of
imprudent
zeal
if
any
one
desires
to
be
an
intercessor
for
the
dead
this
treatise
with
its
frigid
probabilities
will
certainly
remove
all
the
solicitude
he
may
have
previously
experienced
for
this
is
its
only
support
that
since
it
has
been
customary
to
pray
for
the
dead
it
is
a
duty
not
to
be
despised
but
though
i
concede
that
the
ancient
writers
of
the
church
esteemed
it
a
pious
act
to
pray
for
the
dead
yet
we
must
always
remember
a
rule
which
can
never
it
is
not
right
for
us
in
our
prayers
to
introduce
any
thing
of
our
own
but
that
our
desires
must
be
submitted
to
the
word
of
god
because
he
chooses
to
prescribe
what
he
designs
we
should
ask
now
since
there
is
not
a
syllable
in
all
the
law
or
the
gospel
which
allows
us
to
pray
for
the
dead
it
is
a
profane
abuse
of
the
name
of
god
to
attempt
more
than
he
enjoins
but
that
our
adversaries
may
not
glory
as
though
the
ancient
church
were
associated
with
them
in
their
error
i
assert
that
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
them
the
ancients
preserved
the
memory
of
the
dead
that
they
might
not
seem
to
have
cast
off
all
concern
for
them
but
they
at
the
same
time
confessed
their
uncertainty
concerning
their
state
respecting
purgatory
they
asserted
nothing
but
considered
it
as
quite
uncertain
the
moderns
expect
their
reveries
concerning
purgatory
to
be
admitted
as
unquestionable
articles
of
faith
the
fathers
in
the
communion
of
the
sacred
supper
merely
recommended
their
deceased
friends
to
the
mercy
of
god
the
papists
are
incessantly
urging
a
concern
for
the
dead
and
by
their
importunate
declamations
cause
it
to
be
preferred
to
all
the
duties
of
charity
besides
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
us
to
produce
some
testimonies
from
the
fathers
which
manifestly
overthrow
all
those
prayers
for
the
dead
which
were
then
used
such
is
this
of
augustine
when
he
teaches
that
all
men
expect
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
eternal
glory
and
that
every
individual
enters
on
the
fruition
of
that
rest
which
follows
after
death
if
he
is
worthy
of
it
when
he
dies
therefore
he
declares
that
all
the
pious
as
well
as
the
prophets
apostles
and
martyrs
enjoy
a
blessed
repose
immediately
after
death
if
such
be
their
condition
what
advantage
will
our
prayers
confer
on
them
i
pass
over
those
grosser
superstitions
with
which
they
have
fascinated
the
minds
of
the
simple
which
nevertheless
are
innumerable
and
for
the
most
part
so
monstrous
that
they
can
not
be
varnished
over
by
any
honest
pretext
i
omit
also
that
most
disgraceful
traffic
which
they
licentiously
carried
on
while
the
world
was
in
such
a
state
of
stupidity
for
i
should
never
arrive
at
a
conclusion
and
i
have
already
furnished
the
pious
reader
with
sufficient
to
establish
his
conscience
chapter
vi
the
life
of
a
christian
scriptural
arguments
and
exhortations
to
it
we
have
said
that
the
end
of
regeneration
is
that
the
life
of
believers
may
exhibit
a
symmetry
and
agreement
between
the
righteousness
of
god
and
their
obedience
and
that
thus
they
may
confirm
the
adoption
by
which
they
are
accepted
as
his
children
but
though
the
law
of
god
contains
in
it
that
newness
of
life
by
which
his
image
is
restored
in
us
yet
since
our
tardiness
needs
much
stimulation
and
assistance
it
will
be
useful
to
collect
from
various
places
of
scripture
a
rule
for
the
reformation
of
the
life
that
they
who
cordially
repent
may
not
be
bewildered
in
their
pursuits
now
when
i
undertake
the
regulation
of
a
christian
s
life
i
know
that
i
am
entering
on
an
argument
various
and
copious
and
the
magnitude
of
which
might
fill
a
large
volume
if
i
designed
a
complete
discussion
of
every
part
of
it
for
we
see
to
what
great
prolixity
the
fathers
have
extended
the
exhortations
composed
by
them
only
on
single
virtues
and
that
without
any
excessive
loquacity
for
whatever
virtue
it
is
intended
to
recommend
in
an
oration
the
copiousness
of
the
matter
naturally
produces
such
a
diffusiveness
of
style
that
unless
you
have
spoken
largely
you
seem
not
to
have
done
justice
to
the
subject
but
my
design
is
not
to
extend
the
plan
of
life
which
i
am
now
about
to
deliver
so
far
as
particularly
to
discourse
on
each
distinct
virtue
and
expatiate
into
exhortations
these
things
may
be
sought
in
the
writings
of
others
especially
in
the
homilies
of
the
fathers
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
if
i
point
out
a
method
by
which
a
pious
man
may
be
conducted
to
the
right
end
in
the
regulation
of
his
life
and
briefly
assign
a
universal
rule
by
which
he
may
properly
estimate
his
duties
there
will
perhaps
at
some
future
period
be
a
suitable
opportunity
for
declamations
or
i
shall
leave
to
others
an
office
for
which
i
am
not
calculated
i
am
naturally
fond
of
brevity
and
perhaps
were
i
desirous
of
speaking
in
a
more
copious
manner
i
should
not
succeed
and
if
a
more
prolix
method
of
teaching
were
most
acceptable
yet
i
should
scarcely
be
inclined
to
make
the
trial
the
plan
of
the
present
work
however
requires
me
to
treat
a
simple
doctrine
with
all
possible
brevity
as
the
philosophers
have
certain
principles
of
rectitude
and
honour
whence
they
deduce
particular
duties
and
the
whole
circle
of
virtues
so
the
scripture
is
not
without
its
order
in
this
respect
but
maintains
an
economy
superlatively
beautiful
and
far
more
certain
than
all
the
systems
of
the
philosophers
there
is
only
this
the
philosophers
being
ambitious
men
they
have
sedulously
affected
an
exquisite
perspicuity
of
method
in
order
to
make
an
ostentatious
display
of
their
ingenious
dexterity
but
the
spirit
whose
teaching
is
void
of
affectation
has
not
so
exactly
or
perpetually
observed
a
methodical
plan
which
nevertheless
by
using
it
in
some
places
he
sufficiently
indicates
ought
not
to
be
neglected
by
us
ii
this
scripture
plan
of
which
we
are
now
treating
consists
chiefly
in
these
two
first
that
a
love
of
righteousness
to
which
we
have
otherwise
no
natural
propensity
be
instilled
and
introduced
into
our
hearts
the
second
that
a
rule
be
prescribed
to
us
to
prevent
our
taking
any
devious
steps
in
the
race
of
righteousness
now
in
the
recommendation
of
righteousness
it
uses
a
great
number
of
very
excellent
arguments
many
of
which
we
have
before
noticed
on
different
occasions
and
some
we
shall
briefly
touch
on
in
this
place
with
what
better
foundation
can
it
begin
than
when
it
admonishes
us
that
we
ought
to
be
holy
because
god
is
for
when
we
were
dispersed
like
scattered
sheep
and
lost
in
the
labyrinth
of
the
world
he
gathered
us
together
again
that
he
might
associate
us
to
himself
when
we
hear
any
mention
of
our
union
with
god
we
should
remember
that
holiness
must
be
the
bond
of
it
not
that
we
attain
communion
with
him
by
the
merit
of
holiness
since
it
is
rather
necessary
for
us
in
the
first
place
to
adhere
to
him
in
order
that
being
endued
with
his
holiness
we
may
follow
whither
he
calls
but
because
it
is
a
peculiar
property
of
his
glory
not
to
have
any
intercourse
with
iniquity
and
uncleanness
wherefore
also
it
teaches
that
this
is
the
end
of
our
vocation
which
it
is
requisite
for
us
always
to
keep
in
view
if
we
desire
to
correspond
to
the
design
of
god
in
calling
us
for
to
what
purpose
was
it
that
we
were
delivered
from
the
iniquity
and
pollution
of
the
world
in
which
we
had
been
immerged
if
we
permit
ourselves
to
wallow
in
them
as
long
as
we
live
besides
it
also
admonishes
us
that
to
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
god
we
must
inhabit
the
holy
city
jerusalem
which
he
having
consecrated
it
to
himself
can
not
without
impiety
be
profaned
by
impure
inhabitants
whence
these
expressions
he
shall
abide
in
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
that
walketh
uprightly
and
worketh
righteousness
because
it
is
very
unbecoming
the
sanctuary
which
he
inhabits
to
be
rendered
as
filthy
as
a
stable
iii
and
as
a
further
incitement
to
us
it
shows
that
as
god
the
father
has
reconciled
us
to
himself
in
christ
so
he
has
exhibited
to
us
in
him
a
pattern
to
which
it
is
his
will
that
we
should
be
conformed
now
let
those
who
are
of
opinion
that
the
philosophers
have
the
only
just
and
orderly
systems
of
moral
philosophy
show
me
in
any
of
their
works
a
more
excellent
economy
than
that
which
i
have
stated
when
they
intend
to
exhort
us
to
the
sublimest
virtue
they
advance
no
argument
but
that
we
ought
to
live
agreeably
to
nature
but
the
scripture
deduces
its
exhortation
from
the
true
source
when
it
not
only
enjoins
us
to
refer
our
life
to
god
the
author
of
it
to
whom
it
belongs
but
after
having
taught
us
that
we
are
degenerated
from
the
original
state
in
which
we
were
created
adds
that
christ
by
whom
we
have
been
reconciled
to
god
is
proposed
to
us
as
an
example
whose
character
we
should
exhibit
in
our
lives
what
can
be
required
more
efficacious
than
this
one
consideration
indeed
what
can
be
required
besides
for
if
the
lord
has
adopted
us
as
his
sons
on
this
condition
we
exhibit
in
our
life
an
imitation
of
christ
the
bond
of
our
adoption
we
addict
and
devote
ourselves
to
righteousness
we
not
only
most
perfidiously
revolt
from
our
creator
but
also
abjure
him
as
our
saviour
the
scripture
derives
matter
of
exhortation
from
all
the
blessings
of
god
which
it
recounts
to
us
and
from
all
the
parts
of
our
salvation
it
argues
that
since
god
has
discovered
himself
as
a
father
to
us
we
must
be
convicted
of
the
basest
ingratitude
unless
we
on
our
part
manifest
ourselves
to
be
his
children
that
since
christ
has
purified
us
in
the
laver
of
his
blood
and
has
communicated
this
purification
by
baptism
it
does
not
become
us
to
be
defiled
with
fresh
pollution
that
since
he
has
united
us
to
his
body
we
should
as
his
members
solicitously
beware
lest
we
asperse
ourselves
with
any
blemish
or
disgrace
that
since
he
who
is
our
head
has
ascended
to
heaven
we
ought
to
divest
ourselves
of
all
terrestrial
affection
and
aspire
thither
with
all
our
soul
that
since
the
holy
spirit
has
dedicated
us
as
temples
to
god
we
should
use
our
utmost
exertions
that
the
glory
of
god
may
be
displayed
by
us
and
ought
not
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
profaned
with
the
pollution
of
sin
that
since
both
our
soul
and
our
body
are
destined
to
heavenly
incorruption
and
a
crown
we
ought
to
exert
our
most
strenuous
efforts
to
preserve
them
pure
and
uncorrupt
till
the
day
of
the
lord
these
i
say
are
the
best
foundations
for
the
proper
regulation
of
the
life
such
as
we
can
not
find
in
the
philosophers
who
in
the
recommendation
of
virtue
never
rise
above
the
natural
dignity
of
man
iv
this
is
a
proper
place
to
address
those
who
have
nothing
but
the
name
and
the
symbol
of
christ
and
yet
would
be
denominated
christians
but
with
what
face
do
they
glory
in
his
sacred
name
for
none
have
any
intercourse
with
christ
but
those
who
have
received
the
true
knowledge
of
him
from
the
word
of
the
gospel
now
the
apostle
denies
that
any
have
rightly
learned
christ
who
have
not
been
taught
that
they
must
put
off
the
old
man
which
is
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
lusts
and
put
on
christ
their
knowledge
of
christ
then
is
proved
to
be
a
false
and
injurious
pretence
with
whatever
eloquence
and
volubility
they
may
talk
concerning
the
gospel
for
it
is
a
doctrine
not
of
the
tongue
but
of
the
life
and
is
not
apprehended
merely
with
the
understanding
and
memory
like
other
sciences
but
is
then
only
received
when
it
possesses
the
whole
soul
and
finds
a
seat
and
residence
in
the
inmost
affection
of
the
heart
let
them
therefore
either
cease
to
insult
god
by
boasting
themselves
to
be
what
they
are
not
or
show
themselves
disciples
not
unworthy
of
christ
their
master
we
have
allotted
the
first
place
to
the
doctrine
which
contains
our
religion
because
it
is
the
origin
of
our
salvation
but
that
it
may
not
be
unprofitable
to
us
it
must
be
transfused
into
our
breast
pervade
our
manners
and
thus
transform
us
into
itself
if
the
philosophers
are
justly
incensed
against
and
banish
with
disgrace
from
their
society
those
who
while
they
profess
an
art
which
ought
to
be
a
rule
of
life
convert
it
into
a
sophistical
loquacity
how
much
better
reason
may
we
detest
those
sophists
who
are
contented
to
have
the
gospel
on
their
lips
whilst
its
efficacy
ought
to
penetrate
the
inmost
affections
of
the
heart
to
dwell
in
the
soul
and
to
affect
the
whole
man
with
a
hundred
times
more
energy
than
the
frigid
exhortations
of
the
philosophers
yet
i
would
not
insist
upon
it
as
absolutely
necessary
that
the
manners
of
a
christian
should
breathe
nothing
but
the
perfect
gospel
which
nevertheless
ought
both
to
be
wished
and
to
be
aimed
at
but
i
do
not
so
rigorously
require
evangelical
perfection
as
not
to
acknowledge
as
a
christian
one
who
has
not
yet
attained
to
it
for
then
all
would
be
excluded
from
the
church
since
no
man
can
be
found
who
is
not
still
at
a
great
distance
from
it
and
many
have
hitherto
made
but
a
very
small
progress
whom
it
would
nevertheless
be
unjust
to
reject
what
then
let
us
set
before
our
eyes
that
mark
to
which
alone
our
pursuit
must
be
directed
let
that
be
prescribed
as
the
goal
towards
which
we
must
earnestly
tend
for
it
is
not
lawful
for
you
to
make
such
a
compromise
with
god
as
to
undertake
a
part
of
the
duties
prescribed
to
you
in
his
word
and
to
omit
part
of
them
at
your
own
pleasure
for
in
the
first
place
he
every
where
recommends
integrity
as
a
principal
branch
of
his
worship
by
which
he
intends
a
sincere
simplicity
of
heart
free
from
all
guile
and
falsehood
the
opposite
of
which
is
a
double
heart
as
though
it
had
been
said
that
the
beginning
of
a
life
of
uprightness
is
spiritual
when
the
internal
affection
of
the
mind
is
unfeignedly
devoted
to
god
in
the
cultivation
of
holiness
and
righteousness
but
since
no
man
in
this
terrestrial
and
corporeal
prison
has
strength
sufficient
to
press
forward
in
his
course
with
a
due
degree
of
alacrity
and
the
majority
are
oppressed
with
such
great
debility
that
they
stagger
and
halt
and
even
creep
on
the
ground
and
so
make
very
inconsiderable
advances
us
every
one
proceed
according
to
our
small
ability
and
prosecute
the
journey
we
have
begun
no
man
will
be
so
unhappy
but
that
he
may
every
day
make
some
progress
however
small
therefore
let
us
not
cease
to
strive
that
we
may
be
incessantly
advancing
in
the
way
of
the
lord
nor
let
us
despair
on
account
of
the
smallness
of
our
success
for
however
our
success
may
not
correspond
to
our
wishes
yet
our
labour
is
not
lost
when
this
day
surpasses
the
preceding
one
provided
that
with
sincere
simplicity
we
keep
our
end
in
view
and
press
forward
to
the
goal
not
practising
nor
indulging
our
own
evil
propensities
but
perpetually
exerting
our
endeavours
after
increasing
degrees
of
amelioration
till
we
shall
have
arrived
at
a
perfection
of
goodness
which
indeed
we
seek
and
pursue
as
long
as
we
live
and
shall
then
attain
when
divested
of
all
corporeal
infirmity
we
shall
be
admitted
by
god
into
complete
communion
with
him
chapter
vii
summary
of
the
christian
life
although
the
divine
law
contains
a
most
excellent
and
plan
for
the
regulation
of
life
yet
it
has
pleased
the
heavenly
teacher
to
conform
men
by
a
more
accurate
doctrine
to
the
rule
which
he
had
prescribed
in
the
law
and
the
principle
of
that
doctrine
is
it
is
the
duty
of
believers
to
present
their
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
acceptable
unto
god
and
that
in
this
consists
the
legitimate
worship
of
him
hence
is
deduced
an
argument
for
exhorting
them
be
not
conformed
to
this
world
but
be
ye
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
your
mind
that
ye
may
prove
what
is
that
will
of
this
is
a
very
important
consideration
that
we
are
consecrated
and
dedicated
to
god
that
we
may
not
hereafter
think
speak
meditate
or
do
any
thing
but
with
a
view
to
his
glory
for
that
which
is
sacred
can
not
without
great
injustice
towards
him
be
applied
to
unholy
uses
if
we
are
not
our
own
but
the
lord
s
it
is
manifest
both
what
error
we
must
avoid
and
to
what
end
all
the
actions
of
our
lives
are
to
be
directed
we
are
not
our
own
therefore
neither
our
reason
nor
our
will
should
predominate
in
our
deliberations
and
actions
we
are
not
our
own
therefore
let
us
not
propose
it
as
our
end
to
seek
what
may
be
expedient
for
us
according
to
the
flesh
we
are
not
our
own
therefore
let
us
as
far
as
possible
forget
ourselves
and
all
things
that
are
ours
on
the
contrary
we
are
god
s
to
him
therefore
let
us
live
and
die
we
are
god
s
therefore
let
his
wisdom
and
will
preside
in
all
our
actions
we
are
god
s
towards
him
therefore
as
our
only
legitimate
end
let
every
part
of
our
lives
be
directed
o
how
great
a
proficiency
has
that
man
made
who
having
been
taught
that
he
is
not
his
own
has
taken
the
sovereignty
and
government
of
himself
from
his
own
reason
to
surrender
it
to
god
for
as
compliance
with
their
own
inclinations
leads
men
most
effectually
to
ruin
so
to
place
no
dependence
on
our
own
knowledge
or
will
but
merely
to
follow
the
guidance
of
the
lord
is
the
only
way
of
safety
let
this
then
be
the
first
step
to
depart
from
ourselves
that
we
may
apply
all
the
vigour
of
our
faculties
to
the
service
of
the
lord
by
service
i
mean
not
that
only
which
consists
in
verbal
obedience
but
that
by
which
the
human
mind
divested
of
its
natural
carnality
resigns
itself
wholly
to
the
direction
of
the
divine
spirit
of
this
transformation
which
paul
styles
a
renovation
of
the
mind
though
it
is
the
first
entrance
into
life
all
the
philosophers
were
ignorant
for
they
set
up
reason
as
the
sole
directress
of
man
they
think
that
she
is
exclusively
to
be
attended
to
in
short
to
her
alone
they
assign
the
government
of
the
conduct
but
the
christian
philosophy
commands
her
to
give
place
and
submit
to
the
holy
spirit
so
that
now
the
man
himself
lives
not
but
carries
about
christ
living
and
reigning
within
him
ii
hence
also
that
other
consequence
that
we
should
seek
not
our
own
things
but
those
which
are
agreeable
to
the
will
of
the
lord
and
conducive
to
the
promotion
of
his
glory
this
also
argues
a
great
proficiency
that
almost
forgetting
ourselves
and
certainly
neglecting
all
selfish
regards
we
endeavour
faithfully
to
devote
our
attention
to
god
and
his
commandments
for
when
the
scripture
enjoins
us
to
discard
all
private
and
selfish
considerations
it
not
only
erases
from
our
minds
the
cupidity
of
wealth
the
lust
of
power
and
the
favour
of
men
but
also
eradicates
ambition
and
all
appetite
after
human
glory
with
other
more
secret
plagues
indeed
a
christian
man
ought
to
be
so
disposed
and
prepared
as
to
reflect
that
he
has
to
do
with
god
every
moment
of
his
life
thus
as
he
will
measure
all
his
actions
by
his
will
and
determination
so
he
will
refer
the
whole
bias
of
his
mind
religiously
to
him
for
he
who
has
learned
to
regard
god
in
every
undertaking
is
also
raised
above
every
vain
imagination
this
is
that
denial
of
ourselves
which
christ
from
the
commencement
of
their
course
so
diligently
enjoins
on
his
disciples
which
when
it
has
once
obtained
the
government
of
the
heart
leaves
room
neither
for
pride
haughtiness
or
ostentation
nor
for
avarice
libidinousness
luxury
effeminacy
or
any
other
evils
which
are
the
offspring
of
on
the
contrary
wherever
it
does
not
reign
there
either
the
grossest
vices
are
indulged
without
the
least
shame
or
if
there
exist
any
appearance
of
virtue
it
is
vitiated
by
a
depraved
passion
for
glory
show
me
if
you
can
a
single
individual
who
unless
he
has
renounced
himself
according
to
the
command
of
the
lord
is
voluntarily
disposed
to
practise
virtue
among
men
for
all
who
have
not
been
influenced
by
this
disposition
have
followed
virtue
merely
from
the
love
of
praise
and
even
those
of
the
philosophers
who
have
ever
contended
that
virtue
is
desirable
for
its
own
sake
have
been
inflated
with
so
much
arrogance
that
it
is
evident
they
desired
virtue
for
no
other
reason
than
to
furnish
them
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
pride
but
god
is
so
far
from
being
delighted
either
with
those
who
are
ambitious
of
popular
praise
or
with
hearts
so
full
of
pride
and
presumption
that
he
pronounces
they
have
their
reward
in
this
world
and
represents
harlots
and
publicans
as
nearer
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
such
persons
but
we
have
not
yet
clearly
stated
the
number
and
magnitude
of
the
obstacles
by
which
a
man
is
impeded
in
the
pursuit
of
that
which
is
right
as
long
as
he
has
refrained
from
all
for
it
is
an
ancient
and
true
observation
that
there
is
a
world
of
vices
concealed
in
the
soul
of
man
nor
can
you
find
any
other
remedy
than
to
deny
yourself
and
discard
all
selfish
considerations
and
to
devote
your
whole
attention
to
the
pursuit
of
those
things
which
the
lord
requires
of
you
and
which
ought
to
be
pursued
for
this
sole
reason
because
they
are
pleasing
to
him
iii
the
same
apostle
in
another
place
gives
a
more
distinct
though
a
brief
representation
of
all
the
parts
of
a
life
the
grace
of
god
that
bringeth
salvation
hath
appeared
to
all
men
teaching
us
that
denying
ungodliness
and
worldly
lusts
we
should
live
soberly
righteously
and
godly
in
this
present
world
looking
for
that
blessed
hope
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
who
gave
himself
for
us
that
he
might
redeem
us
from
all
iniquity
and
purify
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people
zealous
of
good
for
after
having
proposed
the
grace
of
god
to
animate
us
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
us
truly
to
worship
god
he
removes
two
obstacles
which
are
our
chief
impediments
first
ungodliness
to
which
we
have
naturally
too
strong
a
propensity
and
secondly
worldly
lusts
which
extend
themselves
further
the
term
ungodliness
not
only
denotes
superstitions
but
comprehends
also
every
thing
that
is
repugnant
to
the
serious
fear
of
god
and
worldly
lusts
mean
the
carnal
affections
therefore
he
enjoins
us
with
reference
to
both
tables
of
the
law
to
forsake
our
former
propensities
and
to
renounce
all
the
dictates
of
our
own
reason
and
will
he
reduces
all
the
actions
of
life
to
three
righteousness
and
godliness
sobriety
undoubtedly
denotes
chastity
and
temperance
as
well
as
a
pure
and
frugal
use
of
temporal
blessings
and
patience
under
poverty
righteousness
includes
all
the
duties
of
equity
that
every
man
may
receive
what
is
his
due
godliness
separates
us
from
the
pollutions
of
the
world
and
by
true
holiness
unites
us
to
god
when
these
virtues
are
indissolubly
connected
they
produce
absolute
perfection
but
since
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
forsake
all
carnal
considerations
to
subdue
and
renounce
our
appetites
to
devote
ourselves
to
god
and
our
brethren
and
to
live
the
life
of
angels
amidst
the
corruptions
of
the
world
order
to
extricate
our
minds
from
every
snare
paul
recalls
our
attention
to
the
hope
of
a
blessed
immortality
apprizing
us
that
our
efforts
are
not
in
vain
because
as
christ
once
appeared
as
a
redeemer
so
at
his
final
advent
he
will
manifest
the
benefits
of
the
salvation
he
has
obtained
thus
he
dispels
the
fascinations
which
blind
us
and
prevent
our
aspiring
with
becoming
ardour
to
the
glories
of
heaven
and
at
the
same
time
teaches
us
that
we
must
live
as
strangers
and
pilgrims
in
the
world
that
we
may
not
lose
the
heavenly
inheritance
iv
in
these
words
we
perceive
that
relates
partly
to
men
but
partly
and
indeed
principally
to
god
for
when
the
scripture
enjoins
us
to
conduct
ourselves
in
such
a
manner
towards
men
as
in
honour
to
prefer
one
another
and
faithfully
to
devote
our
whole
attention
to
the
promotion
of
their
advantage
it
gives
such
commands
as
our
heart
can
by
no
means
receive
without
having
been
previously
divested
of
its
natural
bias
for
we
are
all
so
blinded
and
fascinated
with
that
every
one
imagines
he
has
a
just
right
to
exalt
himself
and
to
undervalue
all
others
who
stand
in
competition
with
him
if
god
has
conferred
on
us
any
valuable
qualification
relying
thereon
our
hearts
are
immediately
lifted
up
and
we
not
only
swell
but
almost
burst
with
pride
the
vices
in
which
we
abound
we
sedulously
conceal
from
others
and
flatter
ourselves
with
the
pretence
that
they
are
diminutive
and
trivial
and
even
sometimes
embrace
them
as
virtues
if
the
same
talents
which
we
admire
in
ourselves
or
even
superior
ones
appear
in
others
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
their
superiority
we
depreciate
and
diminish
them
with
the
utmost
malignity
if
they
have
any
vices
not
content
to
notice
them
with
severe
and
sharp
animadversions
we
odiously
amplify
them
hence
that
insolence
that
every
one
of
us
as
if
exempted
from
the
common
lot
is
desirous
of
above
the
rest
of
mankind
and
severely
and
haughtily
contemns
every
man
or
at
least
despises
him
as
an
inferior
the
poor
yield
to
the
rich
plebeians
to
nobles
servants
to
masters
the
illiterate
to
the
learned
but
there
is
no
man
who
does
not
cherish
within
him
some
idea
of
his
own
excellence
thus
all
men
in
flattering
themselves
carry
as
it
were
a
kingdom
in
their
own
breast
for
arrogating
to
themselves
the
height
of
gratulation
they
pass
censure
on
the
understandings
and
conduct
of
others
but
if
any
contention
arises
it
produces
an
eruption
of
the
poison
for
many
discover
some
gentleness
as
long
as
they
find
every
thing
pleasant
and
amiable
but
how
many
are
there
who
preserve
the
same
constant
course
of
good
humour
when
they
are
disturbed
and
irritated
nor
is
there
any
other
remedy
than
the
eradication
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
heart
of
this
most
noxious
pest
of
ambition
and
as
it
is
indeed
eradicated
by
the
doctrine
of
the
scripture
for
if
we
attend
to
its
instructions
we
must
remember
that
the
talents
with
which
god
has
favoured
us
are
not
excellences
originating
from
ourselves
but
free
gifts
of
god
of
which
if
any
are
proud
they
betray
their
ingratitude
who
maketh
thee
to
differ
saith
paul
now
if
thou
didst
receive
all
things
why
dost
thou
glory
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
them
in
the
next
place
by
assiduous
observation
and
acknowledgment
of
our
faults
we
must
recall
our
minds
to
humility
thus
there
will
remain
in
us
nothing
to
inflate
us
but
great
reason
for
dejection
on
the
other
hand
we
are
enjoined
whatever
gifts
of
god
we
perceive
in
others
to
revere
and
esteem
them
so
as
to
honour
those
in
whom
they
reside
for
it
would
betray
great
wickedness
in
us
to
rob
them
of
that
honour
which
god
has
given
them
their
faults
we
are
taught
to
overlook
not
indeed
to
encourage
them
by
adulation
but
never
on
account
of
them
to
insult
those
whom
we
ought
to
cherish
with
benevolence
and
honour
the
result
of
attention
to
these
directions
will
be
that
with
whomsoever
we
are
concerned
we
shall
conduct
ourselves
not
only
with
moderation
and
good
humour
but
with
civility
and
friendship
for
we
shall
never
arrive
at
true
meekness
by
any
other
way
than
by
having
our
hearts
imbued
with
and
a
respect
for
others
how
extremely
difficult
it
is
for
you
to
discharge
your
duty
in
seeking
the
advantage
of
your
neighbour
unless
you
quit
all
selfish
considerations
and
as
it
were
lay
aside
yourself
you
will
effect
nothing
in
this
duty
for
how
can
you
perform
those
which
paul
inculcates
as
works
of
charity
unless
you
renounce
yourself
and
devote
yourself
wholly
to
serve
others
charity
says
he
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
charity
envieth
not
charity
vaunteth
not
itself
is
not
puffed
up
doth
not
behave
itself
unseemly
seeketh
not
her
own
is
not
easily
provoked
if
this
be
all
that
is
required
that
we
seek
not
our
own
yet
we
must
do
no
small
violence
to
nature
which
so
strongly
inclines
us
to
the
exclusive
love
of
ourselves
that
it
does
not
so
easily
permit
us
to
neglect
ourselves
and
our
own
concerns
in
order
to
be
vigilant
for
the
advantage
of
others
and
even
voluntarily
to
recede
from
our
right
to
resign
it
to
another
but
the
scripture
leads
us
to
this
admonishes
us
that
whatever
favours
we
obtain
from
the
lord
we
are
intrusted
with
them
on
this
condition
that
they
should
be
applied
to
the
common
benefit
of
the
church
and
that
therefore
the
legitimate
use
of
all
his
favours
is
a
liberal
and
kind
communication
of
them
to
others
there
can
not
be
imagined
a
more
certain
rule
or
a
more
powerful
exhortation
to
the
observance
of
it
than
when
we
are
taught
that
all
the
blessings
we
enjoy
are
divine
deposits
committed
to
our
trust
on
this
condition
that
they
should
be
dispensed
for
the
benefit
of
our
neighbours
but
the
scripture
goes
still
further
when
it
compares
them
to
the
powers
with
which
the
members
of
the
human
body
are
endued
for
no
member
has
its
power
for
itself
nor
applies
it
to
its
private
use
but
transfuses
it
among
its
receiving
no
advantage
from
it
but
what
proceeds
from
the
common
convenience
of
the
whole
body
so
whatever
ability
a
pious
man
possesses
he
ought
to
possess
it
for
his
brethren
consulting
his
own
private
interest
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
a
cordial
attention
to
the
common
edification
of
the
church
let
this
then
be
our
rule
for
benignity
and
beneficence
whatever
god
has
conferred
on
us
which
enables
us
to
assist
our
neighbour
we
are
the
stewards
of
it
and
must
one
day
render
an
account
of
our
stewardship
and
that
the
only
right
dispensation
of
what
has
been
committed
to
us
is
that
which
is
regulated
by
the
law
of
love
thus
we
shall
not
only
always
connect
the
study
to
promote
the
advantage
of
others
with
a
concern
for
our
own
private
interests
but
shall
prefer
the
good
of
others
to
our
own
to
teach
us
that
the
dispensation
of
the
gifts
we
receive
from
heaven
ought
to
be
regulated
by
this
law
god
anciently
enjoined
the
same
even
in
regard
to
the
smallest
bounties
of
his
liberality
for
he
commanded
the
people
to
offer
to
him
the
of
the
corn
as
a
solemn
avowal
that
it
was
unlawful
for
them
to
enjoy
any
blessings
not
previously
consecrated
to
him
and
if
the
gifts
of
god
are
not
sanctified
to
us
till
after
we
have
with
our
own
hands
dedicated
them
to
their
author
that
must
evidently
be
a
sinful
abuse
which
is
unconnected
with
such
a
dedication
but
in
vain
would
you
attempt
to
enrich
the
lord
by
a
communication
of
your
possessions
therefore
since
your
goodness
extendeth
not
to
him
as
the
psalmist
says
you
must
exercise
it
towards
the
saints
that
are
in
the
earth
and
alms
are
compared
to
sacred
oblations
to
show
that
these
exercises
of
charity
under
the
gospel
correspond
to
those
offerings
under
the
law
vi
moreover
that
we
may
not
be
weary
of
doing
good
which
otherwise
would
of
necessity
soon
be
the
case
we
must
add
also
the
other
character
mentioned
by
the
apostle
that
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
not
easily
the
lord
commands
us
to
do
good
unto
all
men
universally
a
great
part
of
whom
estimated
according
to
their
own
merits
are
very
undeserving
but
here
the
scripture
assists
us
with
an
excellent
rule
when
it
inculcates
that
we
must
not
regard
the
intrinsic
merit
of
men
but
must
consider
the
image
of
god
in
them
to
which
we
owe
all
possible
honour
and
love
but
that
this
image
is
most
carefully
to
be
observed
in
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
inasmuch
as
it
is
renewed
and
restored
by
the
spirit
of
christ
whoever
therefore
is
presented
to
you
that
needs
your
kind
offices
you
have
no
reason
to
refuse
him
your
assistance
say
that
he
is
a
stranger
yet
the
lord
has
impressed
on
him
a
character
which
ought
to
be
familiar
to
you
for
which
reason
he
forbids
you
to
despise
your
own
flesh
say
that
he
is
contemptible
and
worthless
but
the
lord
shows
him
to
be
one
whom
he
has
deigned
to
grace
with
his
own
image
say
that
you
are
obliged
to
him
for
no
services
but
god
has
made
him
as
it
were
his
substitute
to
whom
you
acknowledge
yourself
to
be
under
obligations
for
numerous
and
important
benefits
say
that
he
is
unworthy
of
your
making
the
smallest
exertion
on
his
account
but
the
image
of
god
by
which
he
is
recommended
to
you
deserves
your
surrender
of
yourself
and
all
that
you
possess
if
he
not
only
has
deserved
no
favour
but
on
the
contrary
has
provoked
you
with
injuries
and
insults
this
is
no
just
reason
why
you
should
cease
to
embrace
him
with
your
affection
and
to
perform
to
him
the
offices
of
love
he
has
deserved
you
will
say
very
different
treatment
from
me
but
what
has
the
lord
deserved
who
when
he
commands
you
to
forgive
men
all
their
offences
against
you
certainly
intends
that
they
should
be
charged
to
himself
this
is
the
only
way
of
attaining
that
which
is
not
only
difficult
but
utterly
repugnant
to
the
nature
of
love
them
who
hate
us
to
requite
injuries
with
kindnesses
and
to
return
blessings
for
curses
we
should
remember
that
we
must
not
reflect
on
the
wickedness
of
men
but
contemplate
the
divine
image
in
them
which
concealing
and
obliterating
their
faults
by
its
beauty
and
dignity
allures
us
to
embrace
them
in
the
arms
of
our
love
vii
this
mortification
therefore
will
not
take
place
in
us
unless
we
fulfil
all
the
duties
of
charity
these
are
fulfilled
not
by
him
who
merely
performs
all
the
external
offices
of
charity
even
without
the
omission
of
one
but
by
him
who
does
this
from
a
sincere
principle
of
love
for
it
may
happen
that
a
man
may
fully
discharge
his
duty
to
all
men
with
respect
to
external
actions
and
at
the
same
time
be
very
far
from
discharging
it
in
the
right
way
for
you
may
see
some
men
who
would
be
thought
extremely
liberal
and
yet
never
bestow
any
thing
without
upbraiding
either
by
pride
of
countenance
or
by
insolence
of
language
and
we
are
sunk
to
such
a
depth
of
calamity
in
this
unhappy
age
that
scarcely
any
alms
are
given
at
least
by
the
majority
of
mankind
but
in
a
haughty
and
contemptuous
corruption
which
ought
not
to
have
been
tolerated
even
among
heathen
for
of
christians
there
is
something
further
required
than
to
display
a
cheerfulness
of
countenance
and
to
render
their
benefactions
amiable
by
civility
of
language
in
the
first
place
they
ought
to
imagine
themselves
in
the
situation
of
the
person
who
needs
their
assistance
and
to
commiserate
his
case
just
as
though
they
themselves
felt
and
suffered
the
same
so
that
they
may
be
impelled
by
a
sense
of
mercy
and
humanity
to
afford
assistance
to
him
as
readily
as
if
it
were
to
themselves
he
who
comes
to
the
assistance
of
his
brethren
under
the
influence
of
such
a
disposition
not
only
will
not
contaminate
his
services
with
arrogance
or
reproach
but
will
neither
despise
his
brother
who
is
the
object
of
his
beneficence
as
needing
assistance
nor
domineer
over
him
as
under
an
obligation
to
him
no
more
for
instance
than
we
insult
a
diseased
member
for
whose
restoration
the
rest
of
the
body
labours
or
suppose
it
to
be
under
particular
obligations
to
the
other
members
because
it
has
needed
more
assistance
than
it
returned
for
the
communication
of
services
between
the
members
of
the
body
is
esteemed
to
be
in
no
sense
gratuitous
but
rather
a
discharge
of
that
which
being
due
by
the
law
of
nature
it
would
be
monstrous
to
refuse
and
for
this
reason
he
will
not
suppose
himself
to
have
discharged
all
his
duty
who
has
performed
one
kind
of
service
as
it
generally
happens
that
a
rich
man
after
having
bestowed
some
part
of
his
property
leaves
other
burdens
to
be
borne
by
other
persons
and
considers
himself
as
exempted
from
all
concern
about
them
on
the
contrary
every
man
will
reflect
with
himself
that
however
great
he
may
be
he
is
a
debtor
to
his
neighbour
and
that
no
bounds
should
be
fixed
to
the
exercise
of
beneficence
towards
them
except
when
his
ability
fails
which
as
far
as
it
extends
ought
to
be
limited
by
the
rule
of
charity
viii
let
us
describe
again
more
at
large
the
principal
branch
of
denial
which
we
have
said
relates
to
god
and
indeed
many
observations
have
already
been
made
concerning
it
which
it
would
be
needless
to
repeat
it
will
be
sufficient
to
show
how
it
habituates
us
to
equanimity
and
patience
first
therefore
in
seeking
the
convenience
or
tranquillity
of
the
present
life
the
scripture
calls
us
to
this
point
that
resigning
ourselves
and
all
that
we
have
to
the
will
of
god
we
should
surrender
to
him
the
affections
of
our
heart
to
be
conquered
and
reduced
to
subjection
to
desire
wealth
and
honours
to
be
ambitious
of
power
to
accumulate
riches
to
amass
all
those
vanities
which
appear
conducive
to
magnificence
and
pomp
our
passion
is
furious
and
our
cupidity
unbounded
on
the
contrary
to
poverty
obscurity
and
meanness
we
feel
a
wonderful
fear
and
abhorrence
which
stimulate
us
to
avoid
them
by
all
possible
means
hence
we
may
see
how
restless
the
minds
of
all
those
persons
are
who
regulate
their
lives
according
to
their
own
reason
how
many
arts
they
try
and
with
what
exertions
they
fatigue
themselves
in
order
on
the
one
hand
to
obtain
the
objects
of
ambition
or
avarice
on
the
other
to
avoid
poverty
and
meanness
pious
men
therefore
that
they
may
not
be
involved
in
such
snares
must
pursue
the
following
course
first
let
them
neither
desire
nor
hope
nor
entertain
a
thought
of
prosperity
from
any
other
cause
than
the
divine
blessing
and
on
that
let
them
securely
and
confidently
depend
for
however
the
flesh
may
appear
to
itself
to
be
abundantly
sufficient
when
it
either
attempts
by
its
own
industry
or
strenuous
exertions
to
attain
honours
and
wealth
or
is
assisted
by
the
favour
of
man
it
is
certain
that
all
these
things
are
nothing
and
that
we
shall
obtain
no
advantage
either
by
ingenuity
or
by
labour
but
as
far
as
the
lord
shall
prosper
both
on
the
contrary
his
benediction
alone
finds
a
way
even
through
all
impediments
so
as
to
bring
all
our
affairs
to
a
joyful
and
prosperous
conclusion
and
though
we
may
for
the
most
part
be
able
without
it
to
obtain
for
ourselves
some
degree
of
opulence
and
glory
as
we
daily
behold
impious
men
accumulating
great
honours
and
enormous
wealth
yet
since
those
who
are
under
the
curse
of
god
enjoy
not
even
the
smallest
particle
of
happiness
we
shall
acquire
nothing
without
the
divine
blessing
which
will
not
eventually
prove
a
calamity
to
us
and
that
is
by
no
means
to
be
desired
the
acquisition
of
which
renders
men
more
miserable
ix
therefore
if
we
believe
that
all
the
cause
of
desirable
prosperity
consists
in
the
divine
benediction
alone
without
which
miseries
and
calamities
of
every
kind
await
us
it
follows
also
that
we
should
not
passionately
strive
for
wealth
and
honours
either
relying
on
our
own
diligence
or
acuteness
of
understanding
or
depending
on
the
favour
of
men
or
confiding
in
a
vain
imagination
of
chance
but
that
we
should
always
regard
the
lord
to
be
conducted
by
his
direction
to
whatsoever
lot
he
has
provided
for
us
the
consequence
of
this
will
be
in
the
first
place
that
we
shall
not
rush
forward
to
seize
on
wealth
or
honours
by
unlawful
actions
by
deceitful
and
criminal
arts
by
rapacity
and
injury
of
our
neighbours
but
shall
confine
ourselves
to
the
pursuit
of
those
interests
which
will
not
seduce
us
from
the
path
of
innocence
for
who
can
expect
the
assistance
of
the
divine
benediction
amidst
fraud
rapine
and
other
iniquitous
acts
for
as
that
follows
him
only
whose
thoughts
are
pure
and
whose
actions
are
upright
so
it
calls
away
all
those
by
whom
it
is
sought
from
irregular
thoughts
and
corrupt
practices
in
the
next
place
we
shall
find
a
restraint
laid
upon
us
to
keep
us
from
being
inflamed
with
an
inordinate
desire
of
growing
rich
and
from
ambitiously
aspiring
after
honours
for
with
what
face
can
any
man
confide
in
the
assistance
of
god
towards
obtaining
things
which
he
desires
in
opposition
to
the
divine
word
far
be
it
from
god
to
follow
with
the
aid
of
his
blessing
what
he
curses
with
his
mouth
lastly
if
our
success
be
not
equal
to
our
wishes
and
hopes
yet
we
shall
be
restrained
from
impatience
and
from
execrating
our
condition
whatever
it
may
be
because
we
shall
know
that
this
would
be
murmuring
against
god
at
whose
pleasure
are
dispensed
riches
and
poverty
honour
and
contempt
in
short
he
who
shall
repose
himself
in
the
manner
we
have
mentioned
on
the
divine
blessing
will
neither
hunt
after
the
objects
violently
coveted
by
men
in
general
by
evil
methods
from
which
he
will
expect
no
advantage
nor
will
he
impute
any
prosperous
event
to
himself
and
to
his
own
diligence
industry
or
good
fortune
but
will
acknowledge
god
to
be
the
author
of
it
if
while
the
affairs
of
others
are
flourishing
he
makes
but
a
small
progress
or
even
moves
in
a
retrograde
direction
yet
he
will
bear
his
poverty
with
more
equanimity
and
moderation
than
any
profane
man
would
feel
with
a
mediocrity
of
success
which
would
merely
be
inferior
to
his
wishes
possessing
indeed
a
consolation
in
which
he
may
enjoy
more
tranquil
satisfaction
than
in
the
zenith
of
opulence
or
power
because
he
considers
that
his
affairs
are
ordered
by
the
lord
in
such
a
manner
as
is
conducive
to
his
salvation
this
we
see
was
the
disposition
of
david
who
while
he
follows
god
surrenders
himself
to
his
government
and
declares
that
he
is
as
a
child
that
is
weaned
of
his
mother
neither
do
i
exercise
myself
says
he
in
great
matters
or
in
things
too
high
for
x
nor
is
this
the
only
instance
in
which
pious
persons
should
feel
such
tranquillity
and
patience
the
same
state
of
mind
ought
to
be
extended
to
all
the
events
to
which
the
present
life
is
exposed
therefore
no
man
has
rightly
renounced
himself
but
he
who
has
wholly
resigned
himself
to
the
lord
so
as
to
leave
all
the
parts
of
his
life
to
be
governed
by
his
will
he
whose
mind
is
thus
composed
whatever
may
befall
him
will
neither
think
himself
miserable
nor
invidiously
complain
against
god
on
account
of
his
lot
the
great
necessity
of
this
disposition
will
appear
if
we
consider
the
numerous
accidents
to
which
we
are
subject
diseases
of
various
kinds
frequently
attack
us
at
one
time
the
pestilence
is
raging
at
another
we
are
cruelly
harassed
with
the
calamities
of
war
at
another
time
frost
or
hail
devouring
the
hopes
of
the
year
produces
sterility
which
brings
us
to
penury
a
wife
parents
children
or
other
relatives
are
snatched
away
by
death
our
dwelling
is
consumed
by
a
fire
these
are
the
events
on
the
occurrence
of
which
men
curse
this
life
or
their
natal
day
execrate
heaven
and
earth
reproach
god
and
as
they
are
eloquent
to
blaspheme
accuse
him
of
injustice
and
cruelty
but
it
behoves
a
believer
even
in
these
events
to
contemplate
the
clemency
and
truly
paternal
goodness
of
god
wherefore
if
he
sees
his
relatives
removed
and
his
house
rendered
a
solitary
place
he
must
not
cease
to
bless
the
lord
but
rather
have
recourse
to
this
reflection
yet
the
grace
of
the
lord
which
inhabits
my
house
will
not
leave
it
desolate
or
if
he
sees
his
crops
bitten
or
destroyed
by
frost
or
beaten
down
by
hail
and
famine
threatening
him
yet
he
will
not
sink
into
despondency
or
displeasure
against
god
but
will
abide
in
this
are
under
the
guardian
care
of
god
we
are
the
sheep
of
his
pasture
he
therefore
will
supply
us
with
food
even
in
seasons
of
the
greatest
barrenness
if
he
shall
be
afflicted
with
disease
even
then
he
will
not
be
so
far
discouraged
by
the
bitterness
of
his
pain
as
to
break
out
into
impatience
and
to
complain
against
god
but
will
rather
strengthen
his
patience
by
a
consideration
of
the
justice
and
lenity
of
the
divine
correction
finally
whatever
may
happen
knowing
it
to
be
ordained
by
the
lord
he
will
receive
it
with
a
placid
and
grateful
heart
that
he
may
not
be
guilty
of
contumaciously
resisting
his
authority
to
whose
power
he
has
once
resigned
himself
and
all
that
belongs
to
him
far
therefore
from
the
heart
of
a
christian
man
be
that
foolish
and
most
wretched
consolation
of
the
heathen
who
to
fortify
their
minds
against
adversity
imputed
it
to
fortune
with
whom
they
esteemed
it
foolish
to
be
displeased
because
she
was
thoughtless
and
rash
and
blindly
wounded
without
discrimination
the
worthy
and
the
unworthy
on
the
contrary
the
rule
of
piety
is
that
god
alone
is
the
arbiter
and
governor
of
all
events
both
prosperous
and
adverse
and
that
he
does
not
proceed
with
inconsiderate
impetuosity
but
dispenses
to
us
blessings
and
calamities
with
the
most
systematic
justice
chapter
viii
bearing
the
cross
which
is
a
branch
of
but
it
becomes
a
pious
mind
to
rise
still
higher
even
to
that
to
which
christ
calls
his
disciples
that
every
one
should
take
up
his
for
all
whom
the
lord
has
chosen
and
honoured
with
admission
into
the
society
of
his
saints
ought
to
prepare
themselves
for
a
life
hard
laborious
unquiet
and
replete
with
numerous
and
various
calamities
it
is
the
will
of
their
heavenly
father
to
exercise
them
in
this
manner
that
he
may
have
a
certain
proof
of
those
that
belong
to
him
having
begun
with
christ
his
first
begotten
son
he
pursues
this
method
towards
all
his
children
for
though
christ
was
above
all
others
the
beloved
son
in
whom
the
father
was
always
well
pleased
yet
we
see
how
little
indulgence
and
tenderness
he
experienced
so
that
it
may
be
truly
said
not
only
that
he
was
perpetually
burdened
with
a
cross
during
his
residence
on
earth
but
that
his
whole
life
was
nothing
but
a
kind
of
perpetual
cross
the
apostle
assigns
the
reason
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
learn
obedience
by
the
things
which
he
why
then
should
we
exempt
ourselves
from
that
condition
to
which
it
behoved
christ
our
head
to
be
subject
especially
since
his
submission
was
on
our
account
that
he
might
exhibit
to
us
an
example
of
patience
in
his
own
person
wherefore
the
apostle
teaches
that
it
is
the
destination
of
all
the
children
of
god
to
be
conformed
to
it
is
also
a
source
of
signal
consolation
to
us
in
unpleasant
and
severe
circumstances
which
are
esteemed
adversities
and
calamities
that
we
partake
of
the
sufferings
of
christ
that
as
he
from
a
labyrinth
of
all
evils
entered
into
the
glory
of
heaven
so
we
are
conducted
forward
through
various
tribulations
to
the
same
glory
for
paul
teaches
us
that
when
we
know
the
fellowship
of
his
sufferings
we
also
apprehend
the
power
of
his
resurrection
that
while
we
are
conformed
to
his
death
we
are
thus
prepared
to
partake
of
his
glorious
resurrection
how
much
is
this
adapted
to
alleviate
all
the
bitterness
of
the
cross
that
the
more
we
are
afflicted
by
adversities
our
fellowship
with
christ
is
so
much
the
more
certainly
confirmed
by
this
communion
the
sufferings
themselves
not
only
become
blessings
to
us
but
afford
considerable
assistance
towards
promoting
our
salvation
ii
besides
our
lord
was
under
no
necessity
of
bearing
the
cross
except
to
testify
and
prove
his
obedience
to
his
father
but
there
are
many
reasons
which
render
it
necessary
for
us
to
live
under
a
continual
cross
first
as
we
are
naturally
too
prone
to
attribute
every
thing
to
our
flesh
unless
we
have
as
it
were
ocular
demonstration
of
our
imbecility
we
easily
form
an
extravagant
estimate
of
our
strength
presuming
that
whatever
may
happen
it
will
remain
undaunted
and
invincible
amidst
all
difficulties
this
inflates
us
with
a
foolish
vain
carnal
confidence
relying
on
which
we
become
contumacious
and
proud
in
opposition
to
god
himself
just
as
though
our
own
powers
were
sufficient
for
us
without
his
grace
this
arrogance
he
can
not
better
repress
than
by
proving
to
us
from
experience
not
only
our
great
imbecility
but
also
our
extreme
frailty
therefore
he
afflicts
us
with
ignominy
or
poverty
or
loss
of
relatives
or
disease
or
other
calamities
to
the
bearing
of
which
being
in
ourselves
unequal
we
ere
long
sink
under
them
thus
being
humbled
we
learn
to
invoke
his
strength
which
alone
causes
us
to
stand
erect
under
a
load
of
afflictions
moreover
the
greatest
saints
though
sensible
that
they
stand
by
the
grace
of
god
not
by
their
own
strength
are
nevertheless
more
secure
than
they
ought
to
be
of
their
fortitude
and
constancy
unless
he
leads
them
by
the
discipline
of
the
cross
into
a
deeper
knowledge
of
themselves
this
presumption
insinuated
itself
even
into
david
in
my
prosperity
i
said
i
shall
never
be
moved
lord
by
thy
favour
thou
hast
made
my
mountain
to
stand
strong
thou
didst
hide
thy
face
and
i
was
for
he
confesses
that
his
senses
were
so
stupefied
and
benumbed
by
prosperity
that
disregarding
the
grace
of
god
on
which
he
ought
to
have
depended
he
relied
on
himself
so
as
to
promise
himself
a
permanent
standing
if
this
happened
to
so
great
a
prophet
who
of
us
should
not
be
fearful
and
cautious
though
in
prosperity
therefore
they
have
flattered
themselves
with
the
notion
of
superior
constancy
and
patience
yet
when
humbled
by
adversity
they
learn
that
this
was
mere
hypocrisy
admonished
by
such
evidences
of
their
maladies
believers
advance
in
humility
and
divested
of
corrupt
confidence
in
the
flesh
betake
themselves
to
the
grace
of
god
and
when
they
have
applied
to
it
they
experience
the
presence
of
the
divine
strength
in
which
they
find
abundant
protection
iii
this
is
what
paul
teaches
that
tribulation
worketh
patience
and
patience
for
the
promise
of
god
to
believers
that
he
will
assist
them
in
tribulations
they
experience
to
be
true
when
they
patiently
stand
supported
by
his
power
which
they
certainly
could
not
do
by
their
own
strength
patience
therefore
affords
a
proof
to
the
saints
that
god
will
really
give
the
assistance
he
has
promised
in
every
time
of
need
this
also
confirms
their
hope
for
it
would
be
too
much
ingratitude
not
to
rely
on
the
truth
of
god
for
the
future
which
they
have
hitherto
experienced
to
be
constant
and
certain
we
see
now
what
a
series
of
benefits
we
derive
from
the
cross
for
subverting
the
opinion
which
we
have
falsely
preconceived
of
our
own
strength
and
detecting
our
hypocrisy
with
which
we
are
enamoured
it
expels
pernicious
and
carnal
confidence
when
we
are
thus
humbled
it
teaches
us
to
rely
upon
god
alone
which
keeps
us
from
sinking
under
afflictions
and
victory
is
followed
by
hope
inasmuch
as
the
lord
by
the
performance
of
his
promises
establishes
his
truth
for
the
future
though
these
were
the
only
reasons
that
could
be
given
they
are
sufficient
to
show
the
necessity
of
the
discipline
of
the
cross
for
it
is
no
small
advantage
to
be
divested
of
a
blind
that
we
may
be
fully
conscious
of
our
imbecility
to
be
affected
with
a
sense
of
our
imbecility
that
we
may
learn
to
be
diffident
of
ourselves
to
be
diffident
of
ourselves
that
we
may
transfer
our
confidence
to
god
to
depend
with
unreserved
confidence
on
god
that
relying
on
his
assistance
we
may
persevere
unconquered
to
the
end
to
stand
in
his
grace
that
we
may
know
his
veracity
in
his
promises
to
experience
the
certainty
of
his
promises
that
our
hope
may
thereby
be
strengthened
iv
the
lord
has
also
another
end
in
afflicting
his
children
to
try
their
patience
and
teach
them
obedience
not
indeed
that
they
can
perform
any
other
obedience
to
him
than
that
which
he
has
given
them
but
he
is
pleased
in
this
manner
by
clear
evidences
to
exhibit
and
testify
the
graces
which
he
has
conferred
on
his
saints
that
they
may
not
be
concealed
in
inactivity
within
them
therefore
in
giving
an
open
manifestation
of
the
strength
and
constancy
in
suffering
with
which
he
has
furnished
his
servants
he
is
said
to
try
their
patience
hence
these
expressions
that
god
did
tempt
abraham
and
prove
his
piety
from
the
circumstance
of
his
not
refusing
to
sacrifice
his
own
and
only
son
wherefore
peter
states
that
our
faith
is
tried
by
tribulations
just
as
gold
is
tried
by
fire
in
a
furnace
now
who
can
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
most
excellent
gift
of
patience
which
a
believer
has
received
from
his
god
to
be
brought
forward
into
use
that
it
may
be
ascertained
and
manifested
for
otherwise
men
will
never
esteem
it
as
it
deserves
but
if
god
himself
acts
justly
when
to
prevent
the
virtues
which
he
has
conferred
on
believers
from
being
concealed
in
obscurity
and
remaining
useless
and
perishing
he
furnishes
an
occasion
for
exciting
them
is
the
best
of
reasons
for
the
afflictions
of
the
saints
without
which
they
would
have
no
patience
by
the
cross
they
are
also
i
say
instructed
to
obedience
because
they
are
thus
taught
to
live
not
according
to
their
own
inclination
but
according
to
the
will
of
god
if
every
thing
succeeded
with
them
according
to
their
wishes
they
would
not
know
what
it
is
to
follow
god
but
seneca
mentions
that
this
was
an
ancient
proverb
when
they
would
exhort
any
one
to
bear
adversity
with
patience
follow
this
implied
that
man
submitted
to
the
yoke
of
god
only
when
he
resigned
himself
to
his
corrections
now
if
it
is
most
reasonable
that
we
should
prove
ourselves
in
all
things
obedient
to
our
heavenly
father
we
certainly
ought
not
to
deny
him
the
use
of
every
method
to
accustom
us
to
practise
this
obedience
yet
we
do
not
perceive
how
necessary
this
obedience
is
to
us
unless
we
at
the
same
time
reflect
on
the
great
wantonness
of
our
flesh
to
shake
off
the
divine
yoke
as
soon
as
we
have
been
treated
with
a
little
tenderness
and
indulgence
the
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
with
refractory
horses
which
after
having
been
pampered
for
some
days
in
idleness
grow
fierce
and
untamable
and
regard
not
the
rider
to
whose
management
they
previously
submitted
and
we
are
perpetual
examples
of
what
god
complains
of
in
the
people
of
israel
when
we
are
waxen
fat
and
are
covered
with
fatness
we
kick
against
him
who
has
cherished
and
supported
us
the
beneficence
of
god
ought
to
have
allured
us
to
the
consideration
and
love
of
his
goodness
but
since
such
is
our
ingratitude
that
we
are
rather
constantly
corrupted
by
his
indulgence
it
is
highly
necessary
for
us
to
be
restrained
by
some
discipline
from
breaking
out
into
such
petulance
therefore
that
we
may
not
be
made
haughty
by
an
excessive
abundance
of
wealth
that
we
may
not
become
proud
on
being
distinguished
with
honours
that
we
may
not
be
rendered
insolent
by
being
inflated
with
other
advantages
mental
corporeal
or
external
the
lord
himself
as
he
foresees
will
be
expedient
by
the
remedy
of
the
cross
opposes
restrains
and
subdues
the
haughtiness
of
our
flesh
and
that
by
various
methods
adapted
to
promote
the
benefit
of
each
individual
for
we
are
not
all
equally
afflicted
with
the
same
diseases
or
all
in
need
of
an
equally
severe
method
of
cure
hence
we
see
different
persons
exercised
with
different
kinds
of
crosses
but
whilst
the
heavenly
physician
consulting
the
health
of
all
his
patients
practises
a
milder
treatment
towards
some
and
cures
others
with
rougher
remedies
yet
he
leaves
no
one
completely
exempted
because
he
knows
we
are
all
diseased
without
the
exception
of
a
single
individual
vi
moreover
it
is
necessary
that
our
most
merciful
father
should
not
only
prevent
our
infirmity
for
the
future
but
also
frequently
correct
our
past
offences
to
preserve
us
in
a
course
of
legitimate
obedience
to
himself
wherefore
in
every
affliction
we
ought
immediately
to
recollect
the
course
of
our
past
life
in
reviewing
it
we
shall
certainly
find
that
we
have
committed
what
was
deserving
of
such
chastisement
nevertheless
the
exhortation
to
patience
must
not
be
principally
founded
on
a
consciousness
of
sin
for
the
scripture
furnishes
a
far
better
consideration
when
it
informs
us
that
in
adversity
we
are
chastened
of
the
lord
that
we
should
not
be
condemned
with
the
therefore
even
in
the
bitterness
of
tribulations
it
becomes
us
to
acknowledge
the
clemency
and
benignity
of
our
father
towards
us
since
even
then
he
ceases
not
to
promote
our
salvation
for
he
afflicts
not
to
ruin
or
destroy
us
but
rather
to
deliver
us
from
the
condemnation
of
the
world
this
idea
will
lead
us
to
what
the
scripture
inculcates
in
another
place
my
son
despise
not
the
chastening
of
the
lord
neither
be
weary
of
his
correction
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
correcteth
even
as
a
father
the
son
in
whom
he
when
we
recognize
the
rod
of
a
father
is
it
not
our
duty
rather
to
show
ourselves
obedient
and
docile
children
than
contumaciously
to
imitate
desperate
men
who
have
been
hardened
in
their
transgressions
god
loses
us
unless
he
recalls
us
after
our
defections
from
him
so
that
the
apostle
correctly
remarks
if
ye
be
without
chastisement
then
are
ye
bastards
and
not
we
are
extremely
perverse
therefore
if
we
can
not
bear
with
him
while
he
declares
his
benevolence
towards
us
and
his
great
concern
for
our
salvation
the
scripture
points
out
this
difference
between
believers
and
unbelievers
the
latter
as
the
slaves
of
an
inveterate
and
incurable
iniquity
are
only
rendered
more
wicked
and
obstinate
by
correction
the
former
like
ingenuous
children
are
led
to
a
salutary
repentance
you
have
to
choose
now
in
which
number
you
would
prefer
to
stand
but
having
treated
of
this
subject
elsewhere
i
shall
conclude
contenting
myself
with
having
thus
briefly
touched
on
it
here
vii
but
it
is
a
source
of
peculiar
consolation
when
we
suffer
persecution
for
righteousness
for
we
ought
then
to
reflect
how
greatly
we
are
honoured
by
god
when
he
thus
distinguishes
us
with
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
his
service
i
call
it
persecution
for
righteousness
sake
not
only
when
we
suffer
in
defence
of
the
gospel
but
also
when
we
are
molested
in
the
vindication
of
any
just
cause
whether
therefore
in
asserting
the
truth
of
god
in
opposition
to
the
falsehoods
of
satan
or
in
undertaking
the
protection
of
good
and
innocent
men
against
the
injuries
of
the
wicked
it
be
necessary
for
us
to
incur
the
resentment
and
hatred
of
the
world
by
which
our
lives
our
fortunes
or
our
reputation
may
be
endangered
it
not
be
grievous
or
irksome
to
us
thus
far
to
employ
ourselves
in
the
service
of
god
nor
let
us
imagine
ourselves
to
be
miserable
in
those
respects
in
which
he
has
with
his
own
mouth
pronounced
us
blessed
it
is
true
that
poverty
considered
in
itself
is
misery
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
exile
contempt
imprisonment
ignominy
finally
death
is
of
all
calamities
the
last
and
worst
but
with
the
favour
of
our
god
they
are
all
conducive
to
our
happiness
let
us
therefore
be
content
with
the
testimony
of
christ
rather
than
with
the
false
opinion
of
the
flesh
thus
we
shall
rejoice
like
the
apostles
whenever
he
shall
count
us
worthy
to
suffer
shame
for
his
for
if
being
innocent
and
conscious
of
our
own
integrity
we
are
stripped
of
our
property
by
the
villany
of
the
wicked
we
are
reduced
to
poverty
indeed
among
men
but
we
thereby
obtain
an
increase
of
true
riches
with
god
in
heaven
if
we
are
banished
from
our
country
we
are
more
intimately
received
into
the
family
of
god
if
we
meet
with
vexation
and
contempt
we
are
so
much
the
more
firmly
rooted
in
christ
if
we
are
stigmatized
with
reproach
and
ignominy
we
are
so
much
the
more
exalted
in
the
kingdom
of
god
if
we
are
massacred
it
opens
an
entrance
for
us
into
a
life
of
blessedness
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
setting
a
lower
estimation
on
things
on
which
the
lord
has
attached
such
a
great
value
than
on
the
shadowy
and
evanescent
pleasures
of
the
present
life
viii
since
the
scripture
therefore
by
these
and
similar
instructions
affords
abundant
consolation
under
all
the
ignominy
and
calamity
which
we
sustain
in
the
defence
of
righteousness
we
are
chargeable
with
extreme
ingratitude
if
we
do
not
receive
them
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
with
cheerful
resignation
especially
since
this
is
the
species
of
affliction
or
the
cross
most
peculiar
to
believers
by
which
christ
will
be
glorified
in
us
according
to
the
declaration
of
peter
and
contumelious
treatment
being
to
ingenuous
minds
more
intolerable
than
a
hundred
deaths
paul
expressly
apprizes
us
that
not
only
persecutions
but
reproaches
await
us
because
we
trust
in
the
living
as
in
another
place
he
directs
us
by
his
example
to
go
through
evil
report
and
good
nor
are
we
required
to
exercise
such
a
cheerfulness
as
to
banish
all
sense
of
bitterness
and
sorrow
the
saints
could
discover
no
patience
under
the
cross
unless
they
were
tormented
with
sorrow
and
harassed
with
grief
if
there
were
no
hardship
in
poverty
no
agony
in
diseases
no
distress
in
ignominy
no
horror
in
death
fortitude
or
moderation
would
be
displayed
in
regarding
them
with
absolute
indifference
but
since
each
of
these
by
its
own
essential
bitterness
naturally
preys
on
all
our
hearts
herein
the
fortitude
of
a
believer
is
manifested
if
when
he
experiences
such
bitterness
how
grievously
soever
he
may
be
distressed
by
it
yet
by
valiantly
resisting
he
at
length
overcomes
it
his
patience
displays
itself
if
when
he
is
sharply
provoked
he
is
nevertheless
restrained
by
the
fear
of
god
from
any
eruptions
of
intemperance
his
cheerfulness
is
conspicuous
if
when
he
is
wounded
by
sadness
and
sorrow
he
is
satisfied
with
the
spiritual
consolation
of
god
ix
this
conflict
which
believers
sustain
against
the
natural
emotions
of
sorrow
while
they
cultivate
patience
and
moderation
paul
has
beautifully
described
in
the
following
words
we
are
troubled
on
every
side
yet
not
distressed
we
are
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
persecuted
but
not
forsaken
cast
down
but
not
you
see
that
patiently
to
bear
the
cross
does
not
consist
in
an
absolute
stupefaction
and
privation
of
all
sense
of
sorrow
according
to
the
foolish
description
given
by
the
ancient
stoics
of
a
magnanimous
man
as
one
who
divested
of
the
feelings
of
human
nature
is
alike
unaffected
by
adverse
and
prosperous
events
by
sorrowful
and
joyful
ones
and
what
advantage
have
they
derived
from
this
sublime
wisdom
they
have
depicted
an
image
of
patience
such
as
never
has
been
found
such
as
never
can
exist
among
men
but
in
their
ardour
for
a
patience
too
perfect
and
precise
they
have
banished
its
influence
from
human
life
at
present
also
among
christians
there
are
modern
stoics
who
esteem
it
sinful
not
only
to
groan
and
weep
but
even
to
discover
sadness
and
solicitude
these
paradoxes
generally
proceed
from
idle
men
who
employing
themselves
more
in
speculation
than
in
action
can
produce
nothing
but
such
paradoxical
notions
but
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
philosophy
which
our
master
and
lord
has
condemned
not
only
in
words
but
even
by
his
own
example
for
he
mourned
and
wept
both
for
his
own
calamities
and
for
those
of
others
nor
did
he
teach
his
disciples
a
different
conduct
the
world
says
he
shall
rejoice
but
ye
shall
weep
and
and
that
no
man
might
pervert
it
into
a
crime
he
has
formally
pronounced
a
blessing
on
them
that
mourn
and
no
wonder
for
if
all
tears
be
reprobated
what
judgment
shall
we
form
concerning
the
lord
himself
from
whose
body
distilled
tears
of
blood
if
every
terror
be
stigmatized
with
the
charge
of
unbelief
what
character
shall
we
attribute
to
that
horror
and
consternation
with
which
we
read
that
he
was
so
violently
depressed
if
all
sorrow
be
displeasing
how
can
we
be
pleased
with
his
confessing
that
his
soul
was
sorrowful
even
unto
death
i
have
thought
proper
to
mention
these
things
in
order
to
preserve
pious
minds
from
despair
that
they
may
not
hastily
renounce
the
study
of
patience
because
they
can
not
divest
themselves
of
the
natural
affection
of
sorrow
this
must
necessarily
be
the
case
with
those
who
degrade
patience
into
insensibility
and
a
man
of
fortitude
and
constancy
into
a
senseless
block
for
the
scripture
applauds
the
saints
for
their
patience
when
they
are
afflicted
with
severe
calamities
but
not
broken
and
overcome
by
them
when
they
are
bitterly
distressed
but
are
filled
at
the
same
time
with
spiritual
joy
when
they
are
oppressed
with
anxiety
but
are
revived
and
exhilarated
with
divine
consolation
at
the
same
time
there
is
that
opposition
in
their
hearts
that
the
feelings
of
nature
avoid
and
dread
those
things
which
they
experience
to
be
inimical
to
it
but
the
affection
of
piety
struggles
even
through
these
difficulties
to
obey
the
divine
will
this
opposition
the
lord
expressed
when
he
thus
addressed
peter
when
thou
wast
young
thou
girdedst
thyself
and
walkedst
whither
thou
wouldest
but
when
thou
shalt
be
old
another
shall
gird
thee
and
carry
thee
whither
thou
wouldest
it
is
not
probable
that
peter
when
he
was
called
to
glorify
god
by
his
death
was
drawn
to
it
with
reluctance
and
resistance
in
this
case
his
martyrdom
would
be
entitled
to
little
applause
but
however
he
might
submit
with
the
greatest
alacrity
of
heart
to
the
divine
appointment
yet
not
having
divested
himself
of
human
nature
he
was
distracted
by
two
contrary
inclinations
for
when
he
contemplated
the
bloody
death
he
was
about
to
undergo
stricken
with
a
dread
of
it
he
would
gladly
have
escaped
on
the
contrary
when
he
considered
that
he
was
called
to
it
by
the
divine
will
suppressing
all
fear
he
unreluctantly
and
even
cheerfully
submitted
to
it
it
must
be
our
study
therefore
if
we
would
be
the
disciples
of
christ
that
our
minds
may
be
imbued
with
so
great
a
reverence
for
god
and
such
an
unreserved
obedience
to
him
as
may
overcome
all
contrary
affections
and
make
them
submit
to
his
appointments
thus
whatever
kind
of
affliction
we
endure
even
in
the
greatest
distresses
of
the
mind
we
shall
constantly
retain
our
patience
for
adversity
itself
will
have
its
stings
with
which
we
shall
be
wounded
thus
when
afflicted
with
disease
we
shall
groan
and
be
disquieted
and
pray
for
the
restoration
of
health
thus
when
oppressed
with
poverty
we
shall
feel
the
stings
of
solicitude
and
sorrow
thus
we
shall
be
affected
with
the
grief
of
ignominy
contempt
and
injury
thus
we
shall
shed
the
tears
due
to
nature
at
the
funerals
of
our
friends
but
we
shall
always
recur
to
this
conclusion
this
affliction
is
appointed
by
the
lord
therefore
let
us
submit
to
his
will
even
in
the
agonies
of
grief
amid
groans
and
tears
there
is
a
necessity
for
the
intervention
of
this
reflection
in
order
to
incline
the
heart
cheerfully
to
bear
those
things
by
which
it
is
so
affected
xi
but
as
we
have
deduced
the
principal
reason
for
bearing
the
cross
from
a
consideration
of
the
divine
will
we
must
briefly
point
out
the
difference
between
philosophical
and
christian
patience
for
very
few
of
the
philosophers
have
risen
to
such
an
eminence
of
reason
as
to
perceive
that
we
are
exercised
with
afflictions
by
the
divine
hand
and
to
conclude
that
god
ought
to
be
obeyed
in
these
occurrences
and
even
those
who
have
gone
to
this
length
adduce
no
other
reason
than
because
it
is
necessary
what
is
this
but
saying
that
we
must
submit
to
god
because
it
were
in
vain
to
contend
against
him
for
if
we
obey
god
only
from
necessity
if
it
were
possible
to
escape
from
him
our
obedience
would
cease
but
the
scripture
enjoins
us
to
consider
the
divine
will
in
a
very
different
point
of
view
first
as
consistent
with
justice
and
equity
secondly
as
directed
to
the
accomplishment
of
our
salvation
christian
exhortations
to
patience
then
are
such
as
these
whether
we
are
afflicted
with
poverty
or
exile
or
imprisonment
or
reproach
or
disease
or
loss
of
relatives
or
any
other
similar
calamity
we
must
reflect
that
none
of
these
things
happen
without
the
appointment
and
providence
of
god
and
moreover
that
he
does
nothing
but
with
the
most
systematic
justice
do
not
our
innumerable
and
daily
transgressions
deserve
more
severe
and
grievous
chastisements
than
those
which
his
clemency
inflicts
on
us
is
it
not
highly
reasonable
that
our
flesh
should
be
subdued
and
as
it
were
accustomed
to
the
yoke
lest
it
should
break
out
according
to
its
propensities
into
lawless
excesses
are
not
the
righteousness
and
truth
of
god
worthy
of
our
labours
on
their
account
but
if
the
equity
of
god
evidently
appears
in
our
afflictions
we
can
not
without
iniquity
either
murmur
or
resist
we
no
longer
hear
that
frigid
maxim
of
the
philosophers
we
must
submit
to
necessity
but
a
lesson
lively
and
full
of
efficacy
we
must
obey
because
it
is
unlawful
to
resist
we
must
patiently
suffer
because
impatience
is
a
rebellious
opposition
to
the
justice
of
god
because
nothing
is
really
amiable
to
us
but
what
we
know
to
be
conducive
to
our
benefit
and
salvation
our
most
merciful
father
affords
us
consolation
also
in
this
respect
by
declaring
that
even
in
afflicting
us
with
the
cross
he
promotes
our
salvation
but
if
it
be
evident
that
tribulations
are
salutary
for
us
why
should
we
not
endure
them
with
grateful
and
placid
hearts
in
patiently
bearing
them
therefore
we
do
not
submit
to
necessity
but
acquiesce
in
our
own
benefit
the
effect
of
these
considerations
is
that
in
proportion
as
our
minds
are
oppressed
under
the
cross
with
the
natural
sense
of
affliction
so
greatly
are
they
dilated
with
spiritual
joy
this
is
attended
also
by
thanksgiving
which
can
not
be
without
joy
but
if
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
the
lord
can
only
proceed
from
a
cheerful
and
joyful
heart
there
is
nothing
which
ought
to
repress
these
emotions
within
us
shows
how
necessary
it
is
that
the
bitterness
of
the
cross
should
be
tempered
with
spiritual
joy
chapter
ix
meditation
on
the
future
life
with
whatever
kind
of
tribulation
we
may
be
afflicted
we
should
always
keep
this
end
in
habituate
ourselves
to
a
contempt
of
the
present
life
that
we
may
thereby
be
excited
to
meditation
on
that
which
is
to
come
for
the
lord
well
knowing
our
strong
natural
inclination
to
a
brutish
love
of
the
world
adopts
a
most
excellent
method
to
reclaim
us
and
rouse
us
from
our
insensibility
that
we
may
not
be
too
tenaciously
attached
to
that
foolish
affection
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
is
not
desirous
of
appearing
through
the
whole
course
of
his
life
to
aspire
and
strive
after
celestial
immortality
for
we
are
ashamed
of
excelling
in
no
respect
the
brutal
herds
whose
condition
would
not
be
at
all
inferior
to
ours
unless
there
remained
to
us
a
hope
of
eternity
after
death
but
if
you
examine
the
designs
pursuits
and
actions
of
every
individual
you
will
find
nothing
in
them
but
what
is
terrestrial
hence
that
stupidity
that
the
mental
eyes
dazzled
with
the
vain
splendour
of
riches
power
and
honours
can
not
see
to
any
considerable
distance
the
heart
also
occupied
and
oppressed
with
avarice
ambition
and
other
inordinate
desires
can
not
rise
to
any
eminence
in
a
word
the
whole
soul
fascinated
by
carnal
allurements
seeks
its
felicity
on
earth
to
oppose
this
evil
the
lord
by
continual
lessons
of
miseries
teaches
his
children
the
vanity
of
the
present
life
that
they
may
not
promise
themselves
profound
and
secure
peace
in
it
therefore
he
permits
them
to
be
frequently
disquieted
and
infested
with
wars
or
tumults
with
robberies
or
other
injuries
that
they
may
not
aspire
with
too
much
avidity
after
transient
and
uncertain
riches
or
depend
on
those
which
they
possess
by
exile
sometimes
by
the
sterility
of
the
land
sometimes
by
a
conflagration
sometimes
by
other
means
he
reduces
them
to
indigence
or
at
least
confines
them
within
the
limits
of
mediocrity
that
they
may
not
be
too
complacently
delighted
with
conjugal
blessings
he
either
causes
them
to
be
distressed
with
the
wickedness
of
their
wives
or
humbles
them
with
a
wicked
offspring
or
afflicts
them
with
want
or
loss
of
children
but
if
in
all
these
things
he
is
more
indulgent
to
them
yet
that
they
may
not
be
inflated
with
vain
glory
or
improper
confidence
he
shows
them
by
diseases
and
dangers
the
unstable
and
transitory
nature
of
all
mortal
blessings
we
therefore
truly
derive
advantage
from
the
discipline
of
the
cross
only
when
we
learn
that
this
life
considered
in
itself
is
unquiet
turbulent
miserable
in
numberless
instances
and
in
no
respect
altogether
happy
and
that
all
its
reputed
blessings
are
uncertain
transient
vain
and
adulterated
with
a
mixture
of
many
evils
and
in
consequence
of
this
at
once
conclude
that
nothing
can
be
sought
or
expected
on
earth
but
conflict
and
that
when
we
think
of
a
crown
we
must
raise
our
eyes
towards
heaven
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
mind
is
never
seriously
excited
to
desire
and
meditate
on
the
future
life
without
having
previously
imbibed
a
contempt
of
the
present
ii
there
is
no
medium
between
these
two
extremes
either
the
earth
must
become
vile
in
our
estimation
or
it
must
retain
our
immoderate
love
wherefore
if
we
have
any
concern
about
eternity
we
must
use
our
most
diligent
efforts
to
extricate
ourselves
from
these
fetters
now
since
the
present
life
has
numerous
blandishments
to
attract
us
and
much
pleasure
beauty
and
sweetness
to
delight
us
is
very
necessary
to
our
highest
interests
that
we
should
be
frequently
called
off
that
we
may
not
be
fascinated
with
such
allurements
for
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
we
were
perpetually
happy
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
blessings
of
this
life
since
we
can
not
even
by
the
incessant
stimulus
of
calamity
after
calamity
be
sufficiently
aroused
to
a
consideration
of
its
misery
that
human
life
is
like
a
vapour
or
a
shadow
is
not
only
known
to
the
learned
but
even
the
vulgar
have
no
proverb
more
common
and
perceiving
it
to
be
a
thing
the
knowledge
of
which
would
be
eminently
useful
they
have
represented
it
in
many
remarkable
sentences
but
there
is
scarcely
any
thing
which
we
more
carelessly
consider
or
sooner
forget
for
we
undertake
every
thing
as
though
we
were
erecting
for
ourselves
an
immortality
on
earth
if
a
funeral
pass
by
or
we
walk
among
the
tombs
because
the
image
of
death
is
then
presented
to
our
eyes
we
philosophize
i
confess
in
an
admirable
manner
concerning
the
vanity
of
the
present
life
although
even
that
is
not
always
the
case
for
frequently
we
are
quite
unaffected
with
all
these
things
but
when
this
effect
is
produced
our
philosophy
is
momentary
vanishing
as
soon
as
we
withdraw
and
leaving
not
even
the
smallest
vestige
behind
it
in
short
it
passes
away
and
is
forgotten
just
like
the
plaudits
of
a
theatre
at
any
entertaining
exhibition
and
forgetting
not
only
death
but
mortality
itself
as
though
no
rumour
concerning
it
had
ever
reached
us
we
relapse
into
a
supine
security
of
immortality
on
earth
if
any
one
in
the
mean
time
reminds
us
of
the
unwelcome
proverb
that
man
is
a
creature
of
a
day
we
acknowledge
the
truth
of
it
indeed
but
with
such
inattention
that
the
idea
of
perpetually
living
here
still
remains
fixed
in
our
minds
who
then
can
deny
that
it
is
highly
useful
to
us
all
i
do
not
say
to
be
admonished
by
words
but
by
every
possible
evidence
to
be
convinced
of
the
miserable
condition
of
the
present
life
since
even
after
we
are
convinced
of
it
we
scarcely
cease
to
be
besotted
with
a
perverse
and
foolish
admiration
of
it
as
though
it
contained
the
greatest
attainable
blessings
but
if
it
be
necessary
for
god
to
instruct
us
it
is
on
the
other
hand
our
duty
to
listen
to
him
when
he
calls
and
rebukes
our
sluggishness
in
order
that
despising
the
world
we
may
apply
ourselves
with
our
whole
heart
to
meditate
on
the
life
which
is
to
come
iii
but
believers
should
accustom
themselves
to
such
a
contempt
of
the
present
life
as
may
not
generate
either
hatred
of
life
or
ingratitude
towards
god
for
this
life
though
it
is
replete
with
innumerable
miseries
is
yet
deservedly
reckoned
among
the
divine
blessings
which
must
not
be
despised
wherefore
if
we
discover
nothing
of
the
divine
beneficence
in
it
we
are
already
guilty
of
no
small
ingratitude
towards
god
himself
but
to
believers
especially
it
should
be
a
testimony
of
the
divine
benevolence
since
the
whole
of
it
is
destined
to
the
advancement
of
their
salvation
for
before
he
openly
discovers
to
us
the
inheritance
of
eternal
glory
he
intends
to
reveal
himself
as
our
father
in
inferior
instances
and
those
are
the
benefits
which
he
daily
confers
on
us
since
this
life
then
is
subservient
to
a
knowledge
of
the
divine
goodness
shall
we
fastidiously
scorn
it
as
though
it
contained
no
particle
of
goodness
in
it
we
must
therefore
have
this
sense
and
affection
to
class
it
among
the
bounties
of
the
divine
benignity
which
are
not
to
be
rejected
for
if
scripture
testimonies
were
wanting
which
are
very
numerous
and
clear
even
nature
itself
exhorts
us
to
give
thanks
to
the
lord
for
having
introduced
us
to
the
light
of
life
for
granting
us
the
use
of
it
and
giving
us
all
the
helps
necessary
to
its
preservation
and
it
is
a
far
superior
reason
for
gratitude
if
we
consider
that
here
we
are
in
some
measure
prepared
for
the
glory
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
for
the
lord
has
ordained
that
they
who
are
to
be
hereafter
crowned
in
heaven
must
first
engage
in
conflicts
on
earth
that
they
may
not
triumph
without
having
surmounted
the
difficulties
of
warfare
and
obtained
the
victory
another
reason
is
that
here
we
begin
in
various
blessings
to
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
divine
benignity
that
our
hope
and
desire
may
be
excited
after
the
full
revelation
of
it
when
we
have
come
to
this
conclusion
that
our
life
in
this
world
is
a
gift
of
the
divine
clemency
which
as
we
owe
to
him
we
ought
to
remember
with
gratitude
it
will
then
be
time
for
us
to
descend
to
a
consideration
of
its
most
miserable
condition
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
excessive
love
of
it
to
which
as
has
been
observed
we
are
naturally
inclined
iv
now
whatever
is
abstracted
from
the
corrupt
love
of
this
life
should
be
added
to
the
desire
of
a
better
i
grant
indeed
the
correctness
of
their
opinion
who
considered
it
as
the
greatest
blessing
not
to
be
born
and
as
the
next
to
die
immediately
for
being
heathens
destitute
of
the
knowledge
of
god
and
of
true
religion
what
could
they
see
in
it
but
unhappiness
and
misery
nor
was
there
any
thing
irrational
in
the
conduct
of
those
who
mourned
and
wept
at
the
births
of
their
relations
and
solemnly
rejoiced
at
their
funerals
but
they
practised
this
without
any
advantage
for
destitute
of
the
true
doctrine
of
faith
they
did
not
perceive
how
that
can
conduce
to
the
benefit
of
the
pious
which
in
itself
is
neither
blessed
nor
desirable
and
so
their
views
terminated
in
despair
it
should
be
the
object
of
believers
therefore
in
judging
of
this
mortal
life
that
understanding
it
to
be
of
itself
nothing
but
misery
they
may
apply
themselves
wholly
with
increasing
cheerfulness
and
readiness
to
meditate
on
the
future
and
eternal
life
when
we
come
to
this
comparison
then
indeed
the
former
may
be
not
only
securely
neglected
but
in
competition
with
the
latter
altogether
despised
and
abhorred
for
if
heaven
is
our
country
what
is
the
earth
but
a
place
of
exile
if
the
departure
out
of
the
world
is
an
entrance
into
life
what
is
the
world
but
a
sepulchre
what
is
a
continuance
in
it
but
an
absorption
in
death
if
deliverance
from
the
body
is
an
introduction
into
complete
liberty
what
is
the
body
but
a
prison
if
to
enjoy
the
presence
of
god
is
the
summit
of
felicity
is
it
not
misery
to
be
destitute
of
it
but
till
we
escape
out
of
the
world
we
are
absent
from
the
therefore
if
the
terrestrial
life
be
compared
with
the
celestial
it
should
undoubtedly
be
despised
and
accounted
of
no
value
it
certainly
is
never
to
be
hated
except
in
as
much
as
it
keeps
us
obnoxious
to
sin
although
even
that
hatred
is
not
properly
to
be
applied
to
life
itself
it
becomes
us
however
to
be
so
affected
with
weariness
or
hatred
of
it
as
to
desire
its
end
but
to
be
also
prepared
to
remain
in
it
during
the
divine
pleasure
that
is
to
say
our
weariness
should
be
remote
from
all
murmuring
and
impatience
for
it
is
a
post
at
which
the
lord
has
placed
us
to
be
retained
by
us
till
he
call
us
away
paul
indeed
bewails
his
lot
that
he
is
kept
in
bondage
by
the
fetters
of
the
body
longer
than
he
would
wish
and
sighs
with
an
ardent
desire
of
deliverance
nevertheless
obedient
to
the
divine
authority
he
professes
himself
prepared
for
both
for
he
acknowledges
himself
under
an
obligation
to
god
to
glorify
his
name
either
by
life
or
by
death
but
that
it
belongs
to
the
lord
to
determine
what
will
conduce
most
to
his
glory
therefore
if
it
becomes
us
to
live
and
to
die
to
the
lord
let
us
leave
the
limits
of
our
life
and
death
to
his
decision
yet
in
such
a
manner
as
ardently
to
desire
and
continually
to
meditate
on
the
latter
but
to
despise
the
former
in
comparison
with
future
immortality
and
on
account
of
the
servitude
of
sin
to
wish
to
forsake
it
whenever
it
shall
please
the
lord
but
it
is
monstrous
that
instead
of
this
desire
of
death
multitudes
who
boast
themselves
to
be
christians
are
filled
with
such
a
dread
of
it
that
they
tremble
whenever
it
is
mentioned
as
if
it
were
the
greatest
calamity
that
could
befall
them
it
is
no
wonder
indeed
if
our
natural
feelings
should
be
alarmed
at
hearing
of
our
dissolution
but
it
is
intolerable
that
there
should
not
be
in
a
christian
breast
sufficient
light
of
piety
to
overcome
and
suppress
all
that
fear
with
superior
consolation
for
if
we
consider
that
this
unstable
depraved
corruptible
frail
withering
and
rotten
tabernacle
of
our
body
is
dissolved
in
order
that
it
may
hereafter
be
restored
to
a
durable
perfect
incorruptible
and
heavenly
glory
not
faith
constrain
us
ardently
to
desire
what
nature
dreads
if
we
consider
that
by
death
we
are
recalled
from
exile
to
inhabit
our
own
country
and
that
a
heavenly
one
shall
we
derive
thence
no
consolation
but
it
will
be
said
there
is
nothing
that
does
not
desire
to
be
permanent
i
admit
it
and
contend
that
we
ought
therefore
to
direct
our
views
to
a
future
immortality
where
we
may
obtain
a
fixed
condition
which
is
nowhere
to
be
found
on
earth
for
paul
excellently
teaches
believers
to
go
with
alacrity
to
death
not
for
that
they
would
be
unclothed
but
clothed
shall
brute
animals
and
even
inanimate
creatures
down
to
stocks
and
stones
conscious
of
their
present
vanity
be
looking
forward
to
the
resurrection
at
the
last
day
that
they
may
be
delivered
from
vanity
together
with
the
children
of
god
and
shall
we
endued
with
the
light
of
understanding
and
what
is
superior
to
the
natural
understanding
illuminated
with
the
spirit
of
god
when
the
question
respects
our
own
existence
not
raise
our
minds
above
the
corruption
of
this
world
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
my
present
design
nor
suitable
in
this
place
to
argue
against
such
extreme
perverseness
and
i
have
already
declared
in
the
beginning
that
i
would
not
undertake
a
diffuse
discussion
of
commonplace
topics
i
would
persuade
such
timid
minds
to
read
cyprian
s
treatise
on
mortality
did
they
not
deserve
rather
to
be
referred
to
the
philosophers
that
they
may
begin
to
blush
when
they
see
the
contempt
of
death
discovered
by
them
but
this
we
may
positively
conclude
that
no
man
has
made
any
good
proficiency
in
the
school
of
christ
but
he
who
joyfully
expects
both
the
day
of
death
and
that
of
the
final
resurrection
for
paul
describes
all
believers
by
this
character
and
the
scripture
often
recalls
our
attention
to
it
when
it
intends
to
furnish
us
with
a
reason
for
true
joy
look
up
saith
the
lord
and
lift
up
your
heads
for
your
redemption
draweth
is
it
reasonable
that
what
he
designed
so
powerfully
to
excite
us
to
exultation
and
alacrity
should
produce
nothing
but
sorrow
and
consternation
if
this
be
the
case
why
do
we
still
glory
in
him
as
our
master
let
us
therefore
acquire
a
sounder
judgment
and
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
the
blind
and
stupid
cupidity
of
our
flesh
let
us
not
hesitate
ardently
to
desire
the
advent
of
the
lord
as
of
all
events
the
most
auspicious
for
he
shall
come
to
us
as
a
redeemer
to
deliver
us
from
this
bottomless
gulf
of
all
evils
and
miseries
and
introduce
us
into
that
blessed
inheritance
of
his
life
and
glory
vi
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
whole
family
of
believers
as
long
as
they
dwell
on
the
earth
must
be
accounted
as
sheep
for
the
slaughter
that
they
may
be
conformed
to
christ
their
head
their
state
therefore
would
be
extremely
deplorable
if
they
did
not
elevate
their
thoughts
towards
heaven
rise
above
all
sublunary
things
and
look
beyond
present
appearances
on
the
contrary
when
they
have
once
raised
their
heads
above
this
world
although
they
see
the
impious
flourishing
in
riches
and
honours
and
enjoying
the
most
profound
tranquillity
though
they
see
them
boasting
of
their
splendour
and
luxury
and
behold
them
abounding
in
every
delight
though
they
may
also
be
harassed
by
their
wickedness
insulted
by
their
pride
defrauded
by
their
avarice
and
may
receive
from
them
any
other
lawless
provocations
they
will
find
no
difficulty
in
supporting
themselves
even
under
such
calamities
as
these
for
they
will
keep
in
view
that
day
when
the
lord
will
receive
his
faithful
servants
into
his
peaceful
kingdom
will
wipe
every
tear
from
their
eyes
invest
them
with
robes
of
joy
adorn
them
with
crowns
of
glory
entertain
them
with
his
ineffable
delights
exalt
them
to
fellowship
with
his
majesty
and
in
a
word
honour
them
with
a
participation
of
his
happiness
but
the
impious
who
have
been
great
in
this
world
he
will
precipitate
down
to
the
lowest
ignominy
he
will
change
their
delights
into
torments
and
their
laughter
and
mirth
into
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
he
will
disturb
their
tranquillity
with
dreadful
agonies
of
conscience
and
will
punish
their
delicacy
with
inextinguishable
fire
and
even
put
them
in
subjection
to
the
pious
whose
patience
they
have
abused
for
according
to
paul
it
is
a
righteous
thing
with
god
to
recompense
tribulation
to
them
that
trouble
the
saints
and
to
them
who
are
troubled
rest
when
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
revealed
from
this
is
our
only
consolation
and
deprived
of
this
we
must
of
necessity
either
sink
into
despondency
of
mind
or
solace
ourselves
to
our
own
destruction
with
the
vain
pleasures
of
the
world
for
even
the
psalmist
confesses
that
he
staggered
when
he
was
too
much
engaged
in
contemplating
the
present
prosperity
of
the
impious
and
that
he
could
no
otherwise
establish
himself
till
he
entered
the
sanctuary
of
god
and
directed
his
views
to
the
last
end
of
the
godly
and
of
the
wicked
to
conclude
in
one
word
the
cross
of
christ
triumphs
in
the
hearts
of
believers
over
the
devil
and
the
flesh
over
sin
and
impious
men
only
when
their
eyes
are
directed
to
the
power
of
the
resurrection
chapter
x
the
right
use
of
the
present
life
and
its
supports
by
such
principles
the
scripture
also
fully
instructs
us
in
the
right
use
of
terrestrial
thing
that
ought
not
to
be
neglected
in
a
plan
for
the
regulation
of
life
for
if
we
must
live
we
must
also
use
the
necessary
supports
of
life
nor
can
we
avoid
even
those
things
which
appear
to
subserve
our
pleasures
rather
than
our
necessities
it
behooves
us
therefore
to
observe
moderation
that
we
may
use
them
with
a
pure
conscience
whether
for
necessity
or
for
pleasure
this
the
lord
prescribes
in
his
word
when
he
teaches
us
that
to
his
servants
the
present
life
is
like
a
pilgrimage
in
which
they
are
travelling
towards
the
celestial
kingdom
if
we
are
only
to
pass
through
the
earth
we
ought
undoubtedly
to
make
such
a
use
of
its
blessings
as
will
rather
assist
than
retard
us
in
our
journey
it
is
not
without
reason
therefore
that
paul
advises
us
to
use
this
world
as
though
we
used
it
not
and
to
buy
with
the
same
disposition
with
which
we
sell
but
as
this
is
a
difficult
subject
and
there
is
danger
of
falling
into
one
of
two
opposite
errors
let
us
endeavour
to
proceed
on
safe
ground
that
we
may
avoid
both
extremes
for
there
have
been
some
in
other
respects
good
and
holy
men
who
seeing
that
intemperance
and
luxury
unless
restrained
with
more
than
ordinary
severity
would
perpetually
indulge
the
most
extravagant
excesses
and
desiring
to
correct
such
a
pernicious
evil
have
adopted
the
only
method
which
occurred
to
them
by
permitting
men
to
use
corporeal
blessings
no
further
than
their
necessity
should
absolutely
require
this
advice
was
well
intended
but
they
were
far
too
austere
for
they
committed
the
very
dangerous
error
of
imposing
on
the
conscience
stricter
rules
than
those
which
are
prescribed
to
it
by
the
word
of
the
lord
by
restriction
within
the
demands
of
necessity
they
meant
an
abstinence
from
every
thing
from
which
it
is
possible
to
abstain
so
that
according
to
them
it
would
scarcely
be
lawful
to
eat
or
drink
any
thing
but
bread
and
water
others
have
discovered
still
greater
austerity
like
crates
the
theban
who
is
said
to
have
thrown
his
wealth
into
the
sea
from
an
apprehension
that
unless
it
were
destroyed
he
should
himself
be
destroyed
by
it
on
the
contrary
many
in
the
present
day
who
seek
a
pretext
to
excuse
intemperance
in
the
use
of
external
things
and
at
the
same
time
desire
to
indulge
the
licentiousness
of
the
flesh
assume
as
granted
what
i
by
no
means
concede
to
them
that
this
liberty
is
not
to
be
restricted
by
any
limitation
but
that
it
ought
to
be
left
to
the
conscience
of
every
individual
to
use
as
much
as
he
thinks
lawful
for
himself
i
grant
indeed
that
it
is
neither
right
nor
possible
to
bind
the
conscience
with
the
fixed
and
precise
rules
of
law
in
this
case
but
since
the
scripture
delivers
general
rules
for
the
lawful
use
of
earthly
things
our
practice
ought
certainly
to
be
regulated
by
them
ii
it
must
be
laid
down
as
a
principle
that
the
use
of
the
gifts
of
god
is
not
erroneous
when
it
is
directed
to
the
same
end
for
which
the
creator
himself
has
created
and
appointed
them
for
us
since
he
has
created
them
for
our
benefit
not
for
our
injury
wherefore
no
one
will
observe
a
more
proper
rule
than
he
who
shall
diligently
regard
this
end
now
if
we
consider
for
what
end
he
has
created
the
various
kinds
of
aliment
we
shall
find
that
he
intended
to
provide
not
only
for
our
necessity
but
likewise
for
our
pleasure
and
delight
so
in
clothing
he
has
had
in
view
not
mere
necessity
but
propriety
and
decency
in
herbs
trees
and
fruits
beside
their
various
uses
his
design
has
been
to
gratify
us
by
graceful
forms
and
pleasant
odours
for
if
this
were
not
true
the
psalmist
would
not
recount
among
the
divine
blessings
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
and
oil
to
make
his
face
to
shine
nor
would
the
scriptures
universally
declare
in
commendation
of
his
goodness
that
he
has
given
all
these
things
to
men
and
even
the
natural
properties
of
things
sufficiently
indicate
for
what
end
and
to
what
extent
it
is
lawful
to
use
them
but
shall
the
lord
have
endued
flowers
with
such
beauty
to
present
itself
to
our
eyes
with
such
sweetness
of
smell
to
impress
our
sense
of
smelling
and
shall
it
be
unlawful
for
our
eyes
to
be
affected
with
the
beautiful
sight
or
our
olfactory
nerves
with
the
agreeable
odour
what
has
he
not
made
such
a
distinction
of
colours
as
to
render
some
more
agreeable
than
others
has
he
not
given
to
gold
and
silver
to
ivory
and
marble
a
beauty
which
makes
them
more
precious
than
other
metals
or
stones
in
a
word
has
he
not
made
many
things
worthy
of
our
estimation
independently
of
any
necessary
use
iii
let
us
discard
therefore
that
inhuman
philosophy
which
allowing
no
use
of
the
creatures
but
what
is
absolutely
necessary
not
only
malignantly
deprives
us
of
the
lawful
enjoyment
of
the
divine
beneficence
but
which
can
not
be
embraced
till
it
has
despoiled
man
of
all
his
senses
and
reduced
him
to
a
senseless
block
but
on
the
other
hand
we
must
with
equal
diligence
oppose
the
licentiousness
of
the
flesh
which
unless
it
be
rigidly
restrained
transgresses
every
bound
and
as
i
have
observed
it
has
its
advocates
who
under
the
pretext
of
liberty
allow
it
every
thing
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
one
check
to
it
if
it
be
concluded
that
all
things
are
made
for
us
in
order
that
we
may
know
and
acknowledge
their
author
and
celebrate
his
goodness
towards
us
by
giving
him
thanks
what
will
become
of
thanksgiving
if
you
overcharge
yourself
with
dainties
or
wine
so
as
to
be
stupefied
or
rendered
unfit
for
the
duties
of
piety
and
the
business
of
your
station
where
is
any
acknowledgment
of
god
if
your
body
in
consequence
of
excessive
abundance
being
inflamed
with
the
vilest
passions
infects
the
mind
with
its
impurity
so
that
you
can
not
discern
what
is
right
or
virtuous
where
is
gratitude
towards
god
for
clothing
if
on
account
of
our
sumptuous
apparel
we
admire
ourselves
and
despise
others
if
with
the
elegance
and
beauty
of
it
we
prepare
ourselves
for
unchastity
where
is
our
acknowledgment
of
god
if
our
minds
be
fixed
on
the
splendour
of
our
garments
for
many
so
entirely
devote
all
their
senses
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
that
the
mind
is
as
it
were
buried
in
it
many
are
so
delighted
with
marble
gold
and
pictures
that
they
become
like
statues
are
as
it
were
metamorphosed
into
metal
and
resemble
painted
images
the
flavour
of
meats
or
the
sweetness
of
odours
so
stupefies
some
that
they
have
no
relish
for
any
thing
spiritual
the
same
may
be
observed
in
other
cases
wherefore
it
is
evident
that
this
principle
lays
some
restraint
on
the
license
of
abusing
the
divine
bounties
and
confirms
the
rule
given
us
by
paul
that
we
make
not
provision
for
the
flesh
to
fulfil
the
lusts
thereof
which
if
they
are
allowed
too
much
latitude
will
transgress
all
the
bounds
of
temperance
and
moderation
iv
but
there
is
no
way
more
certain
or
concise
than
what
we
derive
from
a
contempt
of
the
present
life
and
meditation
on
a
heavenly
immortality
for
thence
follow
two
rules
the
first
is
that
they
that
have
wives
be
as
though
they
had
none
and
they
that
buy
as
though
they
possessed
not
and
they
that
use
this
world
as
not
abusing
it
according
to
the
direction
of
paul
the
second
that
we
should
learn
to
bear
penury
with
tranquillity
and
patience
as
well
as
to
enjoy
abundance
with
moderation
he
who
commands
us
to
use
this
world
as
though
we
used
it
not
prohibits
not
only
all
intemperance
in
eating
and
drinking
and
excessive
delicacy
ambition
pride
haughtiness
and
fastidiousness
in
our
furniture
our
habitations
and
our
apparel
but
every
care
and
affection
which
would
either
seduce
or
disturb
us
from
thoughts
of
the
heavenly
life
and
attention
to
the
improvement
of
our
souls
now
it
was
anciently
and
truly
observed
by
cato
that
there
is
a
great
concern
about
adorning
the
body
and
a
great
carelessness
about
virtue
and
it
is
an
old
proverb
that
they
who
are
much
engaged
in
the
care
of
the
body
are
generally
negligent
of
the
soul
therefore
though
the
liberty
of
believers
in
external
things
can
not
be
reduced
to
certain
rules
yet
it
is
evidently
subject
to
this
law
that
they
should
indulge
themselves
as
little
as
possible
that
on
the
contrary
they
should
perpetually
and
resolutely
exert
themselves
to
retrench
all
superfluities
and
to
restrain
luxury
and
that
they
should
diligently
beware
lest
they
pervert
into
impediments
things
which
were
given
for
their
assistance
the
other
rule
will
be
that
persons
whose
property
is
small
should
learn
to
be
patient
under
their
privations
that
they
may
not
be
tormented
with
an
immoderate
desire
of
riches
they
who
observe
this
moderation
have
attained
no
small
proficiency
in
the
school
of
the
lord
as
he
who
has
made
no
proficiency
in
this
point
can
scarcely
give
any
proof
of
his
being
a
disciple
of
christ
for
besides
that
an
inordinate
desire
of
earthly
things
is
accompanied
by
most
other
vices
he
who
is
impatient
under
penury
in
abundance
generally
betrays
the
opposite
passion
by
this
i
mean
that
he
who
is
ashamed
of
a
mean
garment
will
be
proud
of
a
splendid
one
he
who
not
content
with
a
slender
meal
is
disquieted
with
the
desire
of
a
more
sumptuous
one
would
also
intemperately
abuse
those
dainties
should
they
fall
to
his
lot
he
who
bears
a
private
and
mean
condition
with
discontent
and
disquietude
would
not
abstain
from
pride
and
arrogance
should
he
rise
to
eminence
and
honours
let
all
therefore
who
are
sincere
in
the
practice
of
piety
earnestly
endeavour
to
learn
after
the
apostolic
example
both
to
be
full
and
to
be
hungry
both
to
abound
and
to
suffer
the
scripture
has
also
a
third
rule
by
which
it
regulates
the
use
of
earthly
things
of
which
something
was
said
when
we
treated
of
the
precepts
of
charity
for
it
states
that
while
all
these
things
are
given
to
us
by
the
divine
goodness
and
appointed
for
our
benefit
they
are
as
it
were
deposits
intrusted
to
our
care
of
which
we
must
one
day
give
an
account
we
ought
therefore
to
manage
them
in
such
a
manner
that
this
alarm
may
be
incessantly
sounding
in
our
ears
give
an
account
of
thy
let
it
also
be
remembered
by
whom
this
account
is
demanded
that
it
is
by
him
who
has
so
highly
recommended
abstinence
sobriety
frugality
and
modesty
who
abhors
profusion
pride
ostentation
and
vanity
who
approves
of
no
other
management
of
his
blessings
than
such
as
is
connected
with
charity
who
has
with
his
own
mouth
already
condemned
all
those
pleasures
which
seduce
the
heart
from
chastity
and
purity
or
tend
to
impair
the
understanding
vi
lastly
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
lord
commands
every
one
of
us
in
all
the
actions
of
life
to
regard
his
vocation
for
he
knows
with
what
great
inquietude
the
human
mind
is
inflamed
with
what
desultory
levity
it
is
hurried
hither
and
thither
and
how
insatiable
is
its
ambition
to
grasp
different
things
at
once
therefore
to
prevent
universal
confusion
being
produced
by
our
folly
and
temerity
he
has
appointed
to
all
their
particular
duties
in
different
spheres
of
life
and
that
no
one
might
rashly
transgress
the
limits
prescribed
he
has
styled
such
spheres
of
life
vocations
or
callings
every
individual
s
line
of
life
therefore
is
as
it
were
a
post
assigned
him
by
the
lord
that
he
may
not
wander
about
in
uncertainty
all
his
days
and
so
necessary
is
this
distinction
that
in
his
sight
all
our
actions
are
estimated
according
to
it
and
often
very
differently
from
the
sentence
of
human
reason
and
philosophy
there
is
no
exploit
esteemed
more
honourable
even
among
philosophers
than
to
deliver
our
country
from
tyranny
but
the
voice
of
the
celestial
judge
openly
condemns
the
private
man
who
lays
violent
hands
on
a
tyrant
it
is
not
my
design
however
to
stay
to
enumerate
examples
it
is
sufficient
if
we
know
that
the
principle
and
foundation
of
right
conduct
in
every
case
is
the
vocation
of
the
lord
and
that
he
who
disregards
it
will
never
keep
the
right
way
in
the
duties
of
his
station
he
may
sometimes
perhaps
achieve
something
apparently
laudable
but
however
it
may
appear
in
the
eyes
of
men
it
will
be
rejected
at
the
throne
of
god
besides
which
there
will
be
no
consistency
between
the
various
parts
of
his
life
our
life
therefore
will
then
be
best
regulated
when
it
is
directed
to
this
mark
since
no
one
will
be
impelled
by
his
own
temerity
to
attempt
more
than
is
compatible
with
his
calling
because
he
will
know
that
it
is
unlawful
to
transgress
the
bounds
assigned
him
he
that
is
in
obscurity
will
lead
a
private
life
without
discontent
so
as
not
to
desert
the
station
in
which
god
has
placed
him
it
will
also
be
no
small
alleviation
of
his
cares
labours
troubles
and
other
burdens
when
a
man
knows
that
in
all
these
things
he
has
god
for
his
guide
the
magistrate
will
execute
his
office
with
greater
pleasure
the
father
of
a
family
will
confine
himself
to
his
duty
with
more
satisfaction
and
all
in
their
respective
spheres
of
life
will
bear
and
surmount
the
inconveniences
cares
disappointments
and
anxieties
which
befall
them
when
they
shall
be
persuaded
that
every
individual
has
his
burden
laid
upon
him
by
god
hence
also
will
arise
peculiar
consolation
since
there
will
be
no
employment
so
mean
and
sordid
provided
we
follow
our
vocation
as
not
to
appear
truly
respectable
and
be
deemed
highly
important
in
the
sight
of
god
chapter
xi
justification
by
faith
the
name
and
thing
defined
i
think
i
have
already
explained
with
sufficient
care
how
that
men
being
subject
to
the
curse
of
the
law
have
no
means
left
of
attaining
salvation
but
through
faith
alone
and
also
what
faith
itself
is
what
divine
blessings
it
confers
on
man
and
what
effects
it
produces
in
him
the
substance
of
what
i
have
advanced
is
that
christ
being
given
to
us
by
the
goodness
of
god
is
apprehended
and
possessed
by
us
by
faith
by
a
participation
of
whom
we
receive
especially
two
benefits
in
the
first
place
being
by
his
innocence
reconciled
to
god
we
have
in
heaven
a
propitious
father
instead
of
a
judge
in
the
next
place
being
sanctified
by
his
spirit
we
devote
ourselves
to
innocence
and
purity
of
life
of
regeneration
which
is
the
second
benefit
i
have
said
what
i
thought
was
sufficient
the
method
of
justification
has
been
but
slightly
touched
because
it
was
necessary
first
to
understand
that
the
faith
by
which
alone
we
attain
gratuitous
justification
through
the
divine
mercy
is
not
unattended
with
good
works
and
what
is
the
nature
of
the
good
works
of
the
saints
in
which
part
of
this
question
consists
the
subject
of
justification
therefore
must
now
be
fully
discussed
and
discussed
with
the
recollection
that
it
is
the
principal
hinge
by
which
religion
is
supported
in
order
that
we
may
apply
to
it
with
the
greater
attention
and
care
for
unless
we
first
of
all
apprehend
in
what
situation
we
stand
with
respect
to
god
and
what
his
judgment
is
concerning
us
we
have
no
foundation
either
for
a
certainty
of
salvation
or
for
the
exercise
of
piety
towards
god
but
the
necessity
of
knowing
this
subject
will
be
more
evident
from
the
knowledge
itself
ii
but
that
we
may
not
stumble
at
the
threshold
which
would
be
the
case
were
we
to
enter
on
a
disputation
concerning
a
subject
not
understood
by
us
let
us
first
explain
the
meaning
of
these
expressions
be
justified
in
the
sight
of
god
to
be
justified
by
faith
or
by
he
is
said
to
be
in
the
sight
of
who
in
the
divine
judgment
is
reputed
righteous
and
accepted
on
account
of
his
righteousness
for
as
iniquity
is
abominable
to
god
so
no
sinner
can
find
favour
in
his
sight
as
a
sinner
or
so
long
as
he
is
considered
as
such
wherever
sin
is
therefore
it
is
accompanied
with
the
wrath
and
vengeance
of
god
he
is
justified
who
is
considered
not
as
a
sinner
but
as
a
righteous
person
and
on
that
account
stands
in
safety
before
the
tribunal
of
god
where
all
sinners
are
confounded
and
ruined
as
if
an
innocent
man
be
brought
under
an
accusation
before
the
tribunal
of
a
just
judge
when
judgment
is
passed
according
to
his
innocence
he
is
said
to
be
justified
or
acquitted
before
the
judge
so
he
is
justified
before
god
who
not
being
numbered
among
sinners
has
god
for
a
witness
and
asserter
of
his
righteousness
thus
he
must
be
said
therefore
to
be
by
whose
life
discovers
such
purity
and
holiness
as
to
deserve
the
character
of
righteousness
before
the
throne
of
god
or
who
by
the
integrity
of
his
works
can
answer
and
satisfy
the
divine
judgment
on
the
other
hand
he
will
be
by
who
being
excluded
from
the
righteousness
of
works
apprehends
by
faith
the
righteousness
of
christ
invested
in
which
he
appears
in
the
sight
of
god
not
as
a
sinner
but
as
a
righteous
man
thus
we
simply
explain
justification
to
be
an
acceptance
by
which
god
receives
us
into
his
favour
and
esteems
us
as
righteous
persons
and
we
say
that
it
consists
in
the
remission
of
sins
and
the
imputation
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
iii
for
the
confirmation
of
this
point
there
are
many
plain
testimonies
of
scripture
in
the
first
place
that
this
is
the
proper
and
most
usual
signification
of
the
word
can
not
be
denied
but
since
it
would
be
too
tedious
to
collect
all
the
passages
and
compare
them
together
let
it
suffice
to
have
suggested
it
to
the
reader
for
he
will
easily
observe
it
of
himself
i
will
only
produce
a
few
places
where
this
justification
which
we
speak
of
is
expressly
handled
first
where
luke
relates
that
the
people
that
heard
christ
justified
god
and
where
christ
pronounces
that
wisdom
is
justified
of
all
her
justify
in
the
former
passage
does
not
signify
to
confer
righteousness
which
always
remains
perfect
in
him
although
the
whole
world
endeavour
to
rob
him
of
it
nor
in
the
latter
passage
does
justifying
of
denote
making
the
doctrine
of
salvation
righteous
which
is
so
of
itself
but
both
passages
imply
an
ascription
to
god
and
to
his
doctrine
of
the
praise
which
they
deserve
again
when
christ
reprehends
the
pharisees
for
justifying
themselves
he
does
not
mean
that
they
attained
righteousness
by
doing
what
was
right
but
that
they
ostentatiously
endeavoured
to
gain
the
character
of
righteousness
of
which
they
were
destitute
this
is
better
understood
by
persons
who
are
skilled
in
the
hebrew
language
which
gives
the
appellation
of
not
only
to
those
who
are
conscious
to
themselves
of
sin
but
to
persons
who
fall
under
a
sentence
of
condemnation
for
bathsheba
when
she
says
i
and
my
son
solomon
shall
be
counted
offenders
or
sinners
confesses
no
crime
but
complains
that
she
and
her
son
will
be
exposed
to
the
disgrace
of
being
numbered
among
condemned
criminals
and
it
appears
from
the
context
that
this
word
even
in
the
translation
can
not
be
understood
in
any
other
than
a
relative
sense
and
that
it
does
not
denote
the
real
character
but
with
respect
to
the
present
subject
where
paul
says
the
scripture
foresaw
that
god
would
justify
the
heathen
through
faith
what
can
we
understand
but
that
god
imputes
righteousness
through
faith
again
when
he
says
that
god
justifieth
the
ungodly
which
believeth
in
jesus
what
can
be
the
meaning
but
that
he
delivers
him
by
the
blessing
of
faith
from
the
condemnation
deserved
by
his
ungodliness
he
speaks
still
more
plainly
in
the
conclusion
when
he
thus
exclaims
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god
s
elect
it
is
god
that
justifieth
who
is
he
that
condemneth
it
is
christ
that
died
yea
rather
that
is
risen
again
who
also
maketh
intercession
for
for
it
is
just
as
if
he
had
said
who
shall
accuse
them
whom
god
absolves
who
shall
condemn
those
for
whom
christ
intercedes
justification
therefore
is
no
other
than
an
acquittal
from
guilt
of
him
who
was
accused
as
though
his
innocence
had
been
proved
since
god
therefore
justifies
us
through
the
mediation
of
christ
he
acquits
us
not
by
an
admission
of
our
personal
innocence
but
by
an
imputation
of
righteousness
so
that
we
who
are
unrighteous
in
ourselves
are
considered
as
righteous
in
christ
this
is
the
doctrine
preached
by
paul
in
the
thirteenth
chapter
of
the
acts
through
this
man
is
preached
unto
you
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
we
see
that
after
remission
of
sins
this
justification
is
mentioned
as
if
by
way
of
explanation
we
see
clearly
that
it
means
an
acquittal
that
it
is
separated
from
the
works
of
the
law
that
it
is
a
mere
favour
of
christ
that
it
is
apprehended
by
faith
we
see
finally
the
interposition
of
a
satisfaction
when
he
says
that
we
are
justified
from
sins
by
christ
thus
when
it
is
said
that
the
publican
went
down
to
his
house
justified
we
can
not
say
that
he
obtained
righteousness
by
any
merit
of
works
the
meaning
therefore
is
that
after
he
had
obtained
the
pardon
of
his
sins
he
was
considered
as
righteous
in
the
sight
of
god
he
was
righteous
therefore
not
through
any
approbation
of
his
works
but
through
god
s
gracious
absolution
wherefore
ambrose
beautifully
styles
confession
of
sins
a
legitimate
justification
iv
but
leaving
all
contention
about
the
term
if
we
attend
to
the
thing
itself
as
it
is
described
to
us
every
doubt
will
be
removed
for
paul
certainly
describes
justification
as
an
acceptance
when
he
says
to
the
ephesians
god
hath
predestinated
us
to
the
adoption
of
children
by
jesus
christ
to
himself
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
his
will
to
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
his
grace
wherein
he
hath
made
us
the
meaning
of
this
passage
is
the
same
as
when
in
another
place
we
are
said
to
be
justified
freely
by
his
but
in
the
fourth
chapter
to
the
romans
he
first
mentions
an
imputation
of
righteousness
and
immediately
represents
it
as
consisting
in
remission
of
sins
david
says
he
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
man
unto
whom
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
works
saying
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
he
there
indeed
argues
not
concerning
a
branch
but
the
whole
of
justification
he
also
adduces
the
definition
of
it
given
by
david
when
he
pronounces
them
to
be
blessed
who
receive
the
free
forgiveness
of
their
sins
whence
it
appears
that
this
righteousness
of
which
he
speaks
is
simply
opposed
to
guilt
but
the
most
decisive
passage
of
all
on
this
point
is
where
he
teaches
us
that
the
grand
object
of
the
ministry
of
the
gospel
is
that
we
may
be
reconciled
to
god
because
he
is
pleased
to
receive
us
into
his
favour
through
christ
not
imputing
our
trespasses
unto
us
let
the
reader
carefully
examine
the
whole
context
for
when
by
way
of
explanation
he
just
after
adds
in
order
to
describe
the
method
of
reconciliation
that
christ
who
knew
no
sin
was
made
sin
for
us
he
undoubtedly
means
by
the
term
reconciliation
no
other
than
justification
nor
would
there
be
any
truth
in
what
he
affirms
in
another
place
that
we
are
made
righteous
by
the
obedience
of
christ
unless
we
are
reputed
righteous
before
god
in
him
and
out
of
ourselves
but
since
osiander
has
introduced
i
know
not
what
monstrous
notion
of
essential
righteousness
by
which
though
he
had
no
intention
to
destroy
justification
by
grace
yet
he
has
involved
it
in
such
obscurity
as
darkens
pious
minds
and
deprives
them
of
a
serious
sense
of
the
grace
of
christ
will
be
worth
while
before
i
pass
to
any
thing
else
to
refute
this
idle
notion
in
the
first
place
this
speculation
is
the
mere
fruit
of
insatiable
curiosity
he
accumulates
indeed
many
testimonies
of
scripture
to
prove
that
christ
is
one
with
us
and
we
one
with
him
of
which
there
is
no
proof
necessary
but
for
want
of
observing
the
bond
of
this
union
he
bewilders
himself
for
us
however
who
hold
that
we
are
united
to
christ
by
the
secret
energy
of
his
spirit
it
will
be
easy
to
obviate
all
his
sophisms
he
had
conceived
a
notion
similar
to
what
was
held
by
the
manichæans
so
that
he
wished
to
transfuse
the
divine
essence
into
men
hence
another
discovery
of
his
that
adam
was
formed
in
the
image
of
god
because
even
antecedently
to
the
fall
christ
had
been
appointed
the
exemplar
of
the
human
nature
but
for
the
sake
of
brevity
i
shall
only
insist
on
the
subject
now
before
us
he
says
that
we
are
one
with
christ
this
we
admit
but
we
at
the
same
time
deny
that
christ
s
essence
is
blended
with
ours
in
the
next
place
we
assert
that
this
christ
is
our
righteousness
because
he
is
the
eternal
god
the
fountain
of
righteousness
and
the
essential
righteousness
of
grossly
perverted
to
support
his
fallacies
the
reader
will
excuse
me
if
i
now
just
hint
at
these
things
which
the
order
of
the
treatise
requires
to
be
deferred
to
another
place
but
though
he
alleges
in
vindication
of
himself
that
by
the
term
he
only
intends
to
oppose
the
opinion
that
we
are
reputed
righteous
for
the
sake
of
christ
yet
he
manifestly
shows
that
not
content
with
that
righteousness
which
has
been
procured
for
us
by
the
obedience
and
sacrificial
death
of
christ
he
imagines
that
we
are
substantially
righteous
in
god
by
the
infusion
of
his
essence
as
well
as
his
character
for
this
is
the
reason
why
he
so
vehemently
contends
that
not
only
christ
but
the
father
and
the
holy
spirit
also
dwell
in
us
which
though
i
allow
it
to
be
a
truth
yet
i
maintain
that
he
has
grossly
perverted
for
he
ought
to
have
fully
considered
the
nature
of
this
inhabitation
namely
that
the
father
and
the
spirit
are
in
christ
and
that
as
all
the
fulness
of
the
godhead
dwelleth
in
him
so
in
him
we
possess
the
whole
deity
whatever
therefore
he
advances
concerning
the
father
and
the
spirit
separately
has
no
other
tendency
but
to
seduce
the
simple
from
christ
in
the
next
place
he
introduces
a
mixture
of
substances
by
which
god
transfusing
himself
into
us
makes
us
as
it
were
a
part
of
himself
for
he
considers
it
as
of
no
importance
that
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
unites
us
to
christ
so
that
he
becomes
our
head
and
we
become
his
members
unless
his
essence
be
blended
with
ours
but
when
speaking
of
the
father
and
the
spirit
he
more
openly
betrays
his
opinion
which
is
that
we
are
not
justified
by
the
sole
grace
of
the
mediator
and
that
righteousness
is
not
simply
or
really
offered
to
us
in
his
person
but
that
we
are
made
partakers
of
the
divine
righteousness
when
god
is
essentially
united
with
us
vi
if
he
had
only
said
that
christ
in
justifying
us
becomes
ours
by
an
essential
union
and
that
he
is
our
head
not
only
as
man
but
that
the
essence
of
his
divine
nature
also
is
infused
into
us
might
have
entertained
himself
with
his
fancies
with
less
mischief
nor
perhaps
would
so
great
a
contention
have
been
excited
about
this
reverie
but
as
this
principle
is
like
a
cuttlefish
which
by
the
emission
of
black
and
turbid
blood
conceals
its
many
tails
there
is
a
necessity
for
a
vigorous
opposition
to
it
unless
we
mean
to
submit
to
be
openly
robbed
of
that
righteousness
which
alone
affords
us
any
confidence
concerning
our
salvation
for
throughout
this
discussion
the
terms
and
are
extended
by
him
to
two
things
first
he
understands
that
to
be
justified
denotes
not
only
to
be
reconciled
to
god
by
a
free
pardon
but
also
to
be
made
righteous
and
that
righteousness
is
not
a
gratuitous
imputation
but
a
sanctity
and
integrity
inspired
by
the
divine
essence
which
resides
in
us
secondly
he
resolutely
denies
that
christ
is
our
righteousness
as
having
in
the
character
of
a
priest
expiated
our
sins
and
appeased
the
father
on
our
behalf
but
as
being
the
eternal
god
and
everlasting
life
to
prove
the
first
assertion
that
god
justifies
not
only
by
pardoning
but
also
by
regenerating
he
inquires
whether
god
leaves
those
whom
he
justifies
in
their
natural
state
without
any
reformation
of
their
manners
the
answer
is
very
easy
as
christ
can
not
be
divided
so
these
two
blessings
which
we
receive
together
in
him
are
also
inseparable
whomsoever
therefore
god
receives
into
his
favour
he
likewise
gives
them
the
spirit
of
adoption
by
whose
power
he
renews
them
in
his
own
image
but
if
the
brightness
of
the
sun
be
inseparable
from
his
heat
shall
we
therefore
say
that
the
earth
is
warmed
by
his
light
and
illuminated
by
his
heat
nothing
can
be
more
apposite
to
the
present
subject
than
this
similitude
the
beams
of
the
sun
quicken
and
fertilize
the
earth
his
rays
brighten
and
illuminate
it
here
is
a
mutual
and
indivisible
connection
yet
reason
itself
prohibits
us
to
transfer
to
one
what
is
peculiar
to
the
other
in
this
confusion
of
two
blessings
which
osiander
obtrudes
on
us
there
is
a
similar
absurdity
for
as
god
actually
renews
to
the
practice
of
righteousness
those
whom
he
gratuitously
accepts
as
righteous
osiander
confounds
that
gift
of
regeneration
with
this
gracious
acceptance
and
contends
that
they
are
one
and
the
same
but
the
scripture
though
it
connects
them
together
yet
enumerates
them
distinctly
that
the
manifold
grace
of
god
may
be
the
more
evident
to
us
for
that
passage
of
paul
is
not
superfluous
that
christ
is
made
unto
us
righteousness
and
and
whenever
he
argues
from
the
salvation
procured
for
us
from
the
paternal
love
of
god
and
from
the
grace
of
christ
that
we
are
called
to
holiness
and
purity
he
plainly
indicates
that
it
is
one
thing
to
be
justified
and
another
thing
to
be
made
new
creatures
when
osiander
appeals
to
the
scripture
he
corrupts
as
many
passages
as
he
cites
the
assertion
of
paul
that
to
him
that
worketh
not
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly
his
faith
is
counted
for
righteousness
is
explained
by
osiander
to
denote
making
a
man
righteous
with
the
same
temerity
he
corrupts
the
whole
of
that
fourth
chapter
to
the
romans
and
hesitates
not
to
impose
the
same
false
gloss
on
the
passage
just
cited
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god
s
elect
it
is
god
that
justifieth
where
it
is
evident
that
the
apostle
is
treating
simply
of
accusation
and
absolution
and
that
his
meaning
wholly
rests
on
the
antithesis
his
folly
therefore
betrays
itself
both
in
his
arguments
and
in
his
citations
of
scripture
proofs
with
no
more
propriety
does
he
treat
of
the
word
righteousness
when
he
says
that
faith
was
reckoned
to
abraham
for
righteousness
because
that
after
having
embraced
christ
who
is
the
righteousness
of
god
and
god
himself
he
was
eminent
for
the
greatest
virtues
whence
it
appears
that
of
two
good
parts
he
erroneously
makes
one
corrupt
whole
for
the
righteousness
there
mentioned
does
not
belong
to
the
whole
course
of
abraham
s
life
but
rather
the
spirit
testifies
that
notwithstanding
the
singular
eminence
of
abraham
s
virtues
and
his
laudable
and
persevering
advancement
in
them
yet
he
did
not
please
god
any
otherwise
than
in
receiving
by
faith
the
grace
offered
in
the
promise
whence
it
follows
that
in
justification
there
is
no
regard
paid
to
works
as
paul
conclusively
argues
in
that
passage
vii
his
objection
that
the
power
of
justifying
belongs
not
to
faith
of
itself
but
only
as
it
receives
christ
i
readily
admit
for
if
faith
were
to
justify
of
itself
or
by
an
intrinsic
efficacy
as
it
is
expressed
being
always
weak
and
imperfect
it
never
could
effect
this
but
in
part
and
thus
it
would
be
a
defective
justification
which
would
only
confer
on
us
a
partial
salvation
now
we
entertain
no
such
notion
as
the
objection
supposes
on
the
contrary
we
affirm
that
strictly
speaking
it
is
god
that
justifies
and
then
we
transfer
this
to
christ
because
he
is
given
to
us
for
righteousness
faith
we
compare
to
a
vessel
for
unless
we
come
empty
with
the
mouth
of
our
soul
open
to
implore
the
grace
of
christ
we
can
not
receive
christ
whence
it
may
be
inferred
that
we
do
not
detract
from
christ
the
power
of
justifying
when
we
teach
that
faith
receives
him
before
it
receives
his
righteousness
nevertheless
i
can
not
admit
the
intricate
comparisons
of
this
sophist
when
he
says
that
faith
is
christ
as
though
an
earthen
vessel
were
a
treasure
because
gold
is
concealed
in
it
for
faith
although
intrinsically
it
is
of
no
dignity
or
value
justifies
us
by
an
application
of
christ
just
as
a
vessel
full
of
money
constitutes
a
man
rich
therefore
i
maintain
that
faith
which
is
only
the
instrument
by
which
righteousness
is
received
can
not
without
absurdity
be
confounded
with
christ
who
is
the
material
cause
and
at
once
the
author
and
dispenser
of
so
great
a
benefit
we
have
now
removed
the
difficulty
as
to
the
sense
in
which
the
word
ought
to
be
understood
when
it
is
applied
to
justification
viii
respecting
the
reception
of
christ
he
goes
still
greater
lengths
asserting
that
the
internal
word
is
received
by
the
ministry
of
the
external
word
by
which
he
would
divert
us
from
the
priesthood
of
christ
and
the
person
of
the
mediator
to
his
eternal
divinity
we
do
not
divide
christ
but
we
maintain
that
the
same
person
who
by
reconciling
us
to
the
father
in
his
own
flesh
has
given
us
righteousness
is
the
eternal
word
of
god
and
we
confess
that
he
could
not
otherwise
have
discharged
the
office
of
mediator
and
procured
righteousness
for
us
if
he
were
not
the
eternal
god
but
the
opinion
of
osiander
is
that
since
christ
is
both
god
and
man
he
is
made
righteousness
to
us
in
respect
of
his
divine
not
his
human
nature
now
if
this
properly
belong
to
the
divinity
it
will
not
be
peculiar
to
christ
but
common
also
to
the
father
and
the
spirit
since
the
righteousness
of
one
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
others
besides
what
has
been
naturally
eternal
can
not
with
propriety
be
said
to
be
made
unto
but
though
we
grant
that
god
is
made
righteousness
unto
us
how
will
it
agree
with
the
clause
which
is
inserted
that
of
god
he
is
made
unto
us
righteousness
this
is
certainly
peculiar
to
the
character
of
the
mediator
who
though
he
contains
in
himself
the
divine
nature
yet
is
designated
by
this
appropriate
title
by
which
he
is
distinguished
from
the
father
and
the
spirit
but
he
ridiculously
triumphs
in
that
single
expression
of
jeremiah
where
he
promises
that
the
lord
will
be
our
he
can
deduce
nothing
from
this
but
that
christ
who
is
our
righteousness
is
god
manifested
in
the
flesh
we
have
elsewhere
recited
from
paul
s
sermon
that
god
hath
purchased
the
church
with
his
own
if
any
should
infer
from
this
that
the
blood
by
which
our
sins
were
expiated
was
divine
and
part
of
the
divine
nature
who
could
bear
so
monstrous
an
error
but
osiander
thinks
he
has
gained
every
thing
by
this
very
puerile
cavil
he
swells
exults
and
fills
many
pages
with
his
swelling
words
though
the
passage
is
simply
and
readily
explained
by
saying
that
jehovah
when
he
should
become
the
seed
of
david
would
be
the
righteousness
of
the
pious
and
in
the
same
sense
isaiah
informs
us
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
let
us
remark
that
the
speaker
here
is
the
father
that
he
attributes
to
his
son
the
office
of
justifying
that
he
adds
as
a
reason
that
he
is
righteous
and
that
he
places
the
mode
or
means
of
effecting
this
in
the
doctrine
by
which
christ
is
made
known
for
it
is
more
suitable
to
understand
the
word
רעח
in
a
passive
sense
hence
i
conclude
first
that
christ
was
made
righteousness
when
he
assumed
the
form
of
a
servant
secondly
that
he
justifies
us
by
his
own
obedience
to
the
father
and
therefore
that
he
does
this
for
us
not
according
to
his
divine
nature
but
by
reason
of
the
dispensation
committed
to
him
for
though
god
alone
is
the
fountain
of
righteousness
and
we
are
righteous
only
by
a
participation
of
him
yet
because
we
have
been
alienated
from
his
righteousness
through
the
unhappy
breach
occasioned
by
the
fall
we
are
under
the
necessity
of
descending
to
this
inferior
remedy
to
be
justified
by
christ
by
the
efficacy
of
his
death
and
resurrection
ix
if
osiander
object
that
the
excellence
of
this
work
surpasses
the
nature
of
man
and
therefore
can
be
ascribed
only
to
the
divine
nature
former
part
of
the
objection
i
admit
but
in
the
latter
i
maintain
that
he
is
grossly
mistaken
for
although
christ
could
neither
purify
our
souls
with
his
blood
nor
appease
the
father
by
his
sacrifice
nor
absolve
us
from
guilt
nor
in
short
perform
the
functions
of
a
priest
if
he
were
not
truly
god
because
human
power
would
have
been
unequal
to
so
great
a
burden
yet
it
is
certain
that
he
performed
all
these
things
in
his
human
nature
for
if
it
be
inquired
how
are
we
justified
paul
replies
by
the
obedience
of
christ
but
has
he
obeyed
in
any
other
way
than
by
assuming
the
form
of
a
servant
hence
we
infer
that
righteousness
is
presented
to
us
in
his
flesh
in
the
other
passage
also
which
i
much
wonder
that
osiander
is
not
ashamed
to
quote
so
frequently
paul
places
the
source
of
righteousness
wholly
in
the
humanity
of
christ
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
osiander
lays
great
stress
on
the
righteousness
of
god
and
triumphs
as
though
he
had
evinced
it
to
be
his
notion
of
essential
righteousness
whereas
the
words
convey
a
very
different
idea
we
are
righteous
through
the
expiation
effected
by
christ
that
the
righteousness
of
god
means
that
which
god
approves
ought
to
have
been
known
to
the
youngest
novices
just
as
in
john
the
praise
of
god
is
opposed
to
the
praise
of
i
know
that
the
righteousness
of
god
sometimes
denotes
that
of
which
he
is
the
author
and
which
he
bestows
upon
us
but
without
any
observation
of
mine
the
judicious
reader
will
perceive
that
the
meaning
of
this
passage
is
only
that
we
stand
before
the
tribunal
of
god
supported
by
the
atoning
death
of
christ
nor
is
the
term
of
such
great
importance
provided
that
osiander
coincides
with
us
in
this
that
we
are
justified
in
christ
inasmuch
as
he
was
made
an
expiatory
sacrifice
for
us
which
is
altogether
incompatible
with
his
divine
nature
for
this
reason
when
christ
designs
to
seal
the
righteousness
and
salvation
which
he
has
presented
to
us
he
exhibits
a
certain
pledge
of
it
in
his
flesh
he
calls
himself
indeed
living
bread
but
adds
by
way
of
explanation
my
flesh
is
meat
indeed
and
my
blood
is
drink
this
method
of
instruction
is
discovered
in
the
sacraments
which
although
they
direct
our
faith
to
the
whole
of
the
person
of
christ
not
to
a
part
of
him
only
yet
at
the
same
time
teach
that
the
matter
of
justification
and
salvation
resides
in
his
human
nature
not
that
he
either
justifies
or
vivifies
of
himself
as
a
mere
man
but
because
it
has
pleased
god
to
manifest
in
the
mediator
that
which
was
incomprehensible
and
hidden
in
himself
wherefore
i
am
accustomed
to
say
that
christ
is
as
it
were
a
fountain
opened
to
us
whence
we
may
draw
what
were
otherwise
concealed
and
useless
in
that
secret
and
deep
fountain
which
flows
to
us
in
the
person
of
the
mediator
in
this
manner
and
in
this
sense
provided
he
will
submit
to
the
clear
and
forcible
arguments
which
i
have
adduced
i
do
not
deny
that
christ
justifies
us
as
he
is
god
and
man
and
that
this
work
is
common
also
to
the
father
and
the
spirit
and
finally
that
the
righteousness
of
which
christ
makes
us
partakers
is
the
eternal
righteousness
of
the
eternal
god
x
moreover
that
his
cavils
may
not
deceive
the
inexperienced
i
confess
that
we
are
destitute
of
this
incomparable
blessing
till
christ
becomes
ours
i
attribute
therefore
the
highest
importance
to
the
connection
between
the
head
and
members
to
the
inhabitation
of
christ
in
our
hearts
in
a
word
to
the
mystical
union
by
which
we
enjoy
him
so
that
being
made
ours
he
makes
us
partakers
of
the
blessings
with
which
he
is
furnished
we
do
not
then
contemplate
him
at
a
distance
out
of
ourselves
that
his
righteousness
may
be
imputed
to
us
but
because
we
have
put
him
on
and
are
ingrafted
into
his
body
and
because
he
has
deigned
to
unite
us
to
himself
therefore
we
glory
in
a
participation
of
his
righteousness
thus
we
refute
the
cavil
of
osiander
that
faith
is
considered
by
us
as
righteousness
as
though
we
despoiled
christ
of
his
right
when
we
affirm
that
by
faith
we
come
to
him
empty
that
he
alone
may
fill
us
with
his
grace
but
osiander
despising
this
spiritual
connection
insists
on
a
gross
mixture
of
christ
with
believers
and
therefore
invidiously
gives
the
appellation
of
zuinglians
to
all
who
do
not
subscribe
to
his
fanatical
error
concerning
essential
righteousness
because
they
are
not
of
opinion
that
christ
is
substantially
eaten
in
the
sacred
supper
as
for
myself
indeed
i
consider
it
the
highest
honour
to
be
thus
reproached
by
a
man
so
proud
and
so
absorbed
in
his
own
delusions
although
he
attacks
not
me
alone
but
other
writers
well
known
in
the
world
whom
he
ought
to
have
treated
with
modest
respect
but
this
does
not
at
all
affect
me
who
am
supporting
no
private
interest
wherefore
i
the
more
unreservedly
advocate
this
cause
conscious
that
i
am
free
from
every
sinister
motive
his
great
importunity
in
insisting
on
essential
righteousness
and
an
essential
inhabitation
of
christ
in
us
goes
to
this
that
god
transfuses
himself
into
us
by
a
gross
mixture
of
himself
with
us
as
he
pretends
that
there
is
a
carnal
eating
in
the
sacred
supper
secondly
that
god
inspires
his
righteousness
into
us
by
which
we
are
really
righteous
with
him
since
according
to
this
man
such
righteousness
is
as
really
god
himself
as
the
goodness
or
holiness
or
perfection
of
god
i
shall
not
take
much
trouble
to
refute
the
testimonies
adduced
by
him
which
he
violently
perverts
from
the
celestial
to
the
present
state
by
christ
says
peter
are
given
unto
us
exceeding
great
and
precious
promises
that
by
these
ye
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
as
though
we
were
now
such
as
the
gospel
promises
we
shall
be
at
the
second
advent
of
christ
nay
john
apprizes
us
that
we
shall
be
like
god
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
i
have
thought
proper
to
give
the
reader
only
a
small
specimen
and
endeavoured
to
pass
over
these
impertinences
not
that
it
is
difficult
to
refute
them
but
because
i
am
unwilling
to
be
tedious
in
labouring
to
no
purpose
xi
there
is
yet
more
latent
poison
in
the
second
particular
in
which
he
maintains
that
we
are
righteous
together
with
god
i
think
i
have
already
sufficiently
demonstrated
that
although
this
dogma
were
not
so
pestiferous
yet
because
it
is
weak
and
unsatisfactory
and
evaporates
through
its
own
inanity
it
ought
justly
to
be
rejected
by
all
judicious
and
pious
readers
but
this
is
an
impiety
not
to
be
the
pretext
of
a
twofold
righteousness
to
weaken
the
assurance
of
salvation
and
to
elevate
us
above
the
clouds
that
we
may
not
embrace
by
faith
the
grace
of
expiation
and
call
upon
god
with
tranquillity
of
mind
osiander
ridicules
those
who
say
that
justification
is
a
forensic
term
because
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
be
actually
righteous
nor
is
there
any
thing
that
he
more
dislikes
than
the
doctrine
that
we
are
justified
by
gratuitous
imputation
now
if
god
do
not
justify
by
absolving
and
pardoning
us
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
declaration
of
paul
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
them
for
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
first
i
find
that
they
are
accounted
righteous
who
are
reconciled
to
god
the
manner
is
specified
that
god
justifies
by
pardoning
just
as
in
another
passage
justification
is
opposed
to
accusation
which
antithesis
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
form
of
expression
is
borrowed
from
the
practice
of
courts
nor
is
there
any
one
but
tolerably
versed
in
the
hebrew
language
provided
at
the
same
time
that
he
be
in
his
sound
senses
who
can
be
ignorant
that
this
is
the
original
of
the
phrase
and
that
this
is
its
import
and
meaning
now
let
osiander
answer
me
whether
where
paul
says
that
david
describeth
righteousness
without
works
saying
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
whether
i
say
this
be
a
complete
definition
or
a
partial
one
certainly
paul
does
not
adduce
the
testimony
of
the
psalmist
as
teaching
that
pardon
of
sins
is
a
part
of
righteousness
or
concurs
to
the
justification
of
a
man
but
he
includes
the
whole
of
righteousness
in
a
free
remission
pronouncing
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
are
covered
blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
lord
will
not
impute
he
thence
estimates
and
judges
of
the
felicity
of
such
a
man
because
in
this
way
he
becomes
righteous
not
actually
but
by
imputation
osiander
objects
that
it
would
be
dishonourable
to
god
and
contrary
to
his
nature
if
he
justified
those
who
still
remain
actually
impious
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
as
i
have
already
observed
the
grace
of
justification
is
inseparable
from
regeneration
although
they
are
distinct
things
but
since
it
is
sufficiently
known
from
experience
that
some
relics
of
sin
always
remain
in
the
righteous
the
manner
of
their
justification
must
of
necessity
be
very
different
from
that
of
their
renovation
to
newness
of
life
for
the
latter
god
commences
in
his
elect
and
as
long
as
they
live
carries
it
on
gradually
and
sometimes
slowly
so
that
they
are
always
obnoxious
at
his
tribunal
to
the
sentence
of
death
he
justifies
them
however
not
in
a
partial
manner
but
so
completely
that
they
may
boldly
appear
in
heaven
as
being
invested
with
the
purity
of
christ
for
no
portion
of
righteousness
could
satisfy
our
consciences
till
we
have
ascertained
that
god
is
pleased
with
us
as
being
unexceptionably
righteous
before
him
whence
it
follows
that
the
doctrine
of
justification
is
perverted
and
totally
overturned
when
doubts
are
injected
into
the
mind
when
the
confidence
of
salvation
is
shaken
when
bold
and
fearless
worship
is
interrupted
and
when
quiet
and
tranquillity
with
spiritual
joy
are
not
established
whence
paul
argues
from
the
incompatibility
of
things
contrary
to
each
other
that
the
inheritance
is
not
of
the
law
because
then
faith
would
be
rendered
vain
which
if
it
be
fixed
upon
works
must
inevitably
fall
since
not
even
the
most
holy
of
all
saints
will
find
them
afford
any
ground
of
confidence
this
difference
between
justification
and
regeneration
which
osiander
confounds
together
and
denominates
a
twofold
righteousness
is
beautifully
expressed
by
paul
for
speaking
of
his
real
righteousness
or
of
the
integrity
which
he
possessed
to
which
osiander
gives
the
appellation
of
essential
righteousness
he
sorrowfully
exclaims
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
who
shall
deliver
me
from
the
body
of
this
death
but
resorting
to
the
righteousness
which
is
founded
in
the
divine
mercy
alone
he
nobly
triumphs
over
life
and
death
and
reproaches
and
famine
and
the
sword
and
all
adverse
things
and
persons
who
shall
lay
any
thing
to
the
charge
of
god
s
elect
it
is
god
that
justifieth
for
i
am
persuaded
that
nothing
shall
be
able
to
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
jesus
our
he
plainly
declares
himself
to
be
possessed
of
that
righteousness
which
alone
is
fully
sufficient
for
salvation
in
the
sight
of
god
so
that
the
miserable
servitude
in
a
consciousness
of
which
he
was
just
before
bewailing
his
condition
neither
diminishes
nor
in
the
smallest
degree
interrupts
the
confidence
with
which
he
triumphs
this
diversity
is
sufficiently
known
and
is
even
familiar
to
all
the
saints
who
groan
under
the
burden
of
their
iniquities
and
yet
with
victorious
confidence
rise
superior
to
every
fear
but
the
objection
of
osiander
that
it
is
incongruous
to
the
nature
of
god
recoils
upon
himself
for
although
he
invests
the
saints
with
a
twofold
righteousness
as
with
a
garment
covered
with
skins
he
is
notwithstanding
constrained
to
acknowledge
that
no
man
can
please
god
without
the
remission
of
his
sins
if
this
be
true
he
should
at
least
grant
that
they
who
are
not
actually
righteous
are
accounted
righteous
in
proportion
as
it
is
expressed
to
the
degree
of
imputation
but
how
far
shall
a
sinner
extend
this
gracious
acceptance
which
is
substituted
in
the
place
of
righteousness
shall
he
estimate
it
by
the
weight
truly
he
will
be
in
great
uncertainty
to
which
side
to
incline
the
balance
because
he
will
not
be
able
to
assume
to
himself
as
much
righteousness
as
may
be
necessary
to
his
confidence
it
is
well
that
he
who
would
wish
to
prescribe
laws
to
god
is
not
the
arbiter
of
this
cause
but
this
address
of
david
to
god
will
remain
that
thou
mightest
be
justified
when
thou
speakest
and
be
clear
when
thou
and
what
extreme
arrogance
it
is
to
condemn
the
supreme
judge
when
he
freely
absolves
and
not
to
be
satisfied
with
this
answer
i
will
show
mercy
on
whom
i
will
show
mercy
and
yet
the
intercession
of
moses
which
god
checked
with
this
reply
was
not
that
he
would
spare
none
but
that
though
they
were
guilty
he
would
remove
their
guilt
and
absolve
them
all
at
once
we
affirm
therefore
that
those
who
were
undone
are
justified
before
god
by
the
obliteration
of
their
sins
because
sin
being
the
object
of
his
hatred
he
can
love
none
but
those
whom
he
justifies
but
this
is
a
wonderful
method
of
justification
that
sinners
being
invested
with
the
righteousness
of
christ
dread
not
the
judgment
which
they
have
deserved
and
that
while
they
justly
condemn
themselves
they
are
accounted
righteous
out
of
themselves
xii
but
the
readers
must
be
cautioned
to
pay
a
strict
attention
to
the
mystery
which
osiander
boasts
that
he
will
not
conceal
from
them
for
after
having
contended
with
great
prolixity
that
we
do
not
obtain
favour
with
god
solely
through
the
imputation
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
because
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
esteem
those
as
righteous
who
are
not
so
i
use
his
own
words
he
at
length
concludes
that
christ
is
given
to
us
for
righteousness
not
in
respect
of
his
human
but
of
his
divine
nature
and
that
though
this
righteousness
can
only
be
found
in
the
person
of
the
mediator
yet
it
is
the
righteousness
not
of
man
but
of
god
he
does
not
combine
two
righteousnesses
but
evidently
deprives
the
humanity
of
christ
of
all
concern
in
the
matter
of
justification
it
is
worth
while
however
to
hear
what
arguments
he
adduces
it
is
said
in
the
passage
referred
to
that
christ
is
made
unto
us
wisdom
which
is
applicable
only
to
the
eternal
word
neither
therefore
is
christ
considered
as
man
our
righteousness
i
reply
that
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
was
indeed
his
eternal
wisdom
but
this
title
is
here
ascribed
to
him
by
paul
in
a
different
sense
because
in
him
are
hid
all
the
treasures
of
wisdom
and
what
therefore
he
had
with
the
father
he
has
manifested
to
us
and
so
what
paul
says
refers
not
to
the
essence
of
the
son
of
god
but
to
our
benefit
and
is
rightly
applied
to
the
humanity
of
christ
because
although
he
was
a
light
shining
in
darkness
before
his
assumption
of
the
flesh
yet
he
was
a
hidden
light
till
he
appeared
in
the
nature
of
man
as
the
sun
of
righteousness
wherefore
he
calls
himself
the
light
of
the
osiander
betrays
his
folly
likewise
in
objecting
that
justification
exceeds
the
power
of
angels
and
men
since
it
depends
not
upon
the
dignity
of
any
creature
but
upon
the
appointment
of
god
if
angels
were
desirous
to
offer
a
satisfaction
to
god
it
would
be
unavailing
because
they
have
not
been
appointed
to
it
this
was
peculiar
to
the
man
christ
who
was
made
under
the
law
to
redeem
us
from
the
curse
of
the
he
likewise
very
unjustly
accuses
those
who
deny
that
christ
is
our
righteousness
according
to
his
divine
nature
of
retaining
only
one
part
of
christ
and
what
is
worse
making
two
gods
because
though
they
acknowledge
that
god
dwells
in
us
yet
they
flatly
deny
that
we
are
righteous
through
the
righteousness
of
god
for
if
we
call
christ
the
author
of
life
in
consequence
of
his
having
suffered
death
that
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
we
deny
this
honour
to
his
complete
person
as
god
manifested
in
the
flesh
we
only
state
with
precision
the
means
by
which
the
righteousness
of
god
is
conveyed
to
us
so
that
we
may
enjoy
it
in
this
osiander
has
fallen
into
a
very
pernicious
error
we
do
not
deny
that
what
is
openly
exhibited
to
us
in
christ
flows
from
the
secret
grace
and
power
of
god
nor
do
we
refuse
to
admit
that
the
righteousness
conferred
on
us
by
christ
is
the
righteousness
of
god
as
proceeding
from
him
but
we
constantly
maintain
that
we
have
righteousness
and
life
in
the
death
and
resurrection
of
christ
i
pass
over
that
shameful
accumulation
of
passages
with
which
without
any
discrimination
and
even
without
common
sense
he
has
burdened
the
reader
in
order
to
evince
that
wherever
mention
is
made
of
righteousness
it
ought
to
be
understood
of
this
essential
righteousness
as
where
david
implores
the
righteousness
of
god
to
assist
him
which
as
he
does
above
a
hundred
times
osiander
hesitates
not
to
pervert
such
a
great
number
of
passages
nor
is
there
any
thing
more
solid
in
his
other
objection
that
the
term
righteousness
is
properly
and
rightly
applied
to
that
by
which
we
are
excited
to
rectitude
of
conduct
and
that
god
alone
worketh
in
us
both
to
will
and
to
now
we
do
not
deny
that
god
renews
us
by
his
spirit
to
holiness
and
righteousness
of
life
but
it
should
first
be
inquired
whether
he
does
this
immediately
by
himself
or
through
the
medium
of
his
son
with
whom
he
has
deposited
all
the
plenitude
of
his
spirit
that
with
his
abundance
he
might
relieve
the
necessities
of
his
members
besides
though
righteousness
flows
to
us
from
the
secret
fountain
of
the
divinity
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
christ
who
in
the
flesh
sanctified
himself
for
our
sakes
is
our
righteousness
with
respect
to
his
divine
nature
equally
frivolous
is
his
assertion
that
christ
himself
was
righteous
with
the
righteousness
of
god
because
if
he
had
not
been
influenced
by
the
will
of
the
father
not
even
he
could
have
performed
the
part
assigned
him
for
though
it
has
been
elsewhere
observed
that
all
the
merit
of
christ
himself
flows
from
the
mere
favour
of
god
yet
this
affords
no
countenance
to
the
fanciful
notion
with
which
osiander
fascinates
his
own
eyes
and
those
of
the
injudicious
for
who
would
admit
the
inference
that
because
god
is
the
original
source
of
our
righteousness
we
are
therefore
essentially
righteous
and
have
the
essence
of
the
divine
righteousness
residing
in
us
in
redeeming
the
church
isaiah
says
god
put
on
righteousness
as
a
breastplate
but
was
it
to
spoil
christ
of
the
armour
which
he
had
given
him
and
to
prevent
his
being
a
perfect
redeemer
the
prophet
only
meant
that
god
borrowed
nothing
extrinsic
to
himself
and
had
no
assistance
in
the
work
of
our
redemption
paul
has
briefly
intimated
the
same
in
other
words
saying
that
he
has
given
us
salvation
in
order
to
declare
his
nor
does
this
at
all
contradict
what
he
states
in
another
place
that
by
the
obedience
of
one
we
are
made
to
conclude
whoever
fabricates
a
twofold
righteousness
that
wretched
souls
may
not
rely
wholly
and
exclusively
on
the
divine
mercy
makes
christ
an
object
of
contempt
and
crowns
him
with
platted
thorns
xiii
but
as
many
persons
imagine
righteousness
to
be
composed
of
faith
and
works
let
us
also
prove
before
we
proceed
that
the
righteousness
of
faith
is
so
exceedingly
different
from
that
of
works
that
if
one
be
established
the
other
must
necessarily
be
subverted
the
apostle
says
i
count
all
things
but
dung
that
i
may
win
christ
and
be
found
in
him
not
having
mine
own
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
but
that
which
is
through
the
faith
of
christ
the
righteousness
which
is
of
god
by
here
we
see
a
comparison
of
two
opposites
and
an
implication
that
his
own
righteousness
must
be
forsaken
by
him
who
wishes
to
obtain
the
righteousness
of
christ
wherefore
in
another
place
he
states
this
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
ruin
of
the
jews
that
going
about
to
establish
their
own
righteousness
they
have
not
submitted
themselves
unto
the
righteousness
of
if
by
establishing
our
own
righteousness
we
reject
the
righteousness
of
god
then
in
order
to
obtain
the
latter
the
former
must
doubtless
be
entirely
renounced
he
conveys
the
same
sentiment
when
he
asserts
that
boasting
is
excluded
by
what
law
of
works
nay
but
by
the
law
of
whence
it
follows
that
as
long
as
there
remains
the
least
particle
of
righteousness
in
our
works
we
retain
some
cause
for
boasting
but
if
faith
excludes
all
boasting
the
righteousness
of
works
can
by
no
means
be
associated
with
the
righteousness
of
faith
to
this
purpose
he
speaks
so
clearly
in
the
fourth
chapter
to
the
romans
as
to
leave
no
room
for
cavil
or
evasion
if
abraham
says
he
were
justified
by
works
he
hath
whereof
to
he
adds
but
he
hath
not
whereof
to
glory
before
it
follows
therefore
that
he
was
not
justified
by
works
then
he
advances
another
argument
from
two
opposites
to
him
that
worketh
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
grace
but
of
but
righteousness
is
attributed
to
faith
through
grace
therefore
it
is
not
from
the
merit
of
works
adieu
therefore
to
the
fanciful
notion
of
those
who
imagine
a
righteousness
compounded
of
faith
and
works
xiv
the
sophists
who
amuse
and
delight
themselves
with
perversion
of
the
scripture
and
vain
cavils
think
they
have
found
a
most
excellent
subterfuge
when
they
explain
in
these
passages
to
mean
those
which
men
yet
unregenerate
perform
without
the
grace
of
christ
merely
through
the
unassisted
efforts
of
their
own
and
deny
that
they
relate
to
spiritual
works
thus
according
to
them
a
man
is
justified
both
by
faith
and
by
works
only
the
works
are
not
properly
his
own
but
the
gifts
of
christ
and
the
fruits
of
regeneration
for
they
say
that
paul
spoke
in
this
manner
only
that
the
jews
who
relied
on
their
own
strength
might
be
convinced
of
their
folly
in
arrogating
righteousness
to
themselves
whereas
it
is
conferred
on
us
solely
by
the
spirit
of
christ
not
by
any
exertion
properly
our
own
but
they
do
not
observe
that
in
the
contrast
of
legal
and
evangelical
righteousness
which
paul
introduces
in
another
place
all
works
are
excluded
by
what
title
soever
they
may
be
distinguished
for
he
teaches
that
this
is
the
righteousness
of
the
law
that
he
who
has
fulfilled
the
command
of
the
law
shall
obtain
salvation
but
that
the
righteousness
of
faith
consists
in
believing
that
christ
has
died
and
is
risen
again
besides
we
shall
see
as
we
proceed
in
its
proper
place
that
sanctification
and
righteousness
are
separate
blessings
of
christ
whence
it
follows
that
even
spiritual
works
are
not
taken
into
the
account
when
the
power
of
justifying
is
attributed
to
faith
and
the
assertion
of
paul
in
the
place
just
cited
that
abraham
has
not
whereof
to
glory
before
god
since
he
was
not
justified
by
works
ought
not
to
be
restricted
to
any
literal
appearance
or
external
display
of
virtue
or
to
any
efforts
of
but
though
the
life
of
the
patriarch
was
spiritual
and
almost
angelic
yet
his
works
did
not
possess
sufficient
merit
to
justify
him
before
god
xv
the
errors
of
the
schoolmen
who
mingle
their
preparations
are
rather
more
gross
but
they
instil
into
the
simple
and
incautious
a
doctrine
equally
corrupt
while
under
the
pretext
of
the
spirit
and
of
grace
they
conceal
the
mercy
of
god
which
alone
can
calm
the
terrors
of
the
conscience
we
confess
indeed
with
paul
that
the
doers
of
the
law
are
justified
before
god
but
since
we
are
all
far
from
being
observers
of
the
law
we
conclude
that
those
works
which
should
be
principally
available
to
justification
afford
us
no
assistance
because
we
are
destitute
of
them
with
respect
to
the
common
papists
or
schoolmen
they
are
in
this
matter
doubly
deceived
both
in
denominating
faith
a
certainty
of
conscience
in
expecting
from
god
a
reward
of
merit
and
in
explaining
the
grace
of
god
to
be
not
an
imputation
of
gratuitous
righteousness
but
the
spirit
assisting
to
the
pursuit
of
holiness
they
read
in
the
apostle
he
that
cometh
to
god
must
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
is
a
rewarder
of
them
that
diligently
seek
but
they
do
not
consider
the
manner
of
seeking
him
and
that
they
mistake
the
sense
of
the
word
grace
is
evident
from
their
writings
for
lombard
represents
justification
by
christ
as
given
us
in
two
ways
he
says
the
death
of
christ
justifies
us
first
because
it
excites
charity
in
our
hearts
by
which
we
are
made
actually
righteous
secondly
because
it
destroys
sin
by
which
the
devil
held
us
in
captivity
so
that
now
it
can
not
condemn
we
see
how
he
considers
the
grace
of
god
in
justification
to
consist
in
our
being
directed
to
good
works
by
the
grace
of
the
holy
spirit
he
wished
indeed
to
follow
the
opinion
of
augustine
but
he
follows
him
at
a
great
distance
and
even
deviates
considerably
from
a
close
imitation
of
him
for
whatever
he
finds
clearly
stated
by
him
he
obscures
and
whatever
he
finds
pure
in
him
he
corrupts
the
schools
have
always
been
running
into
worse
and
worse
errors
till
at
length
they
have
precipitated
themselves
into
a
kind
of
pelagianism
nor
indeed
is
the
opinion
of
augustine
or
at
least
his
manner
of
expression
to
be
altogether
admitted
for
though
he
excellently
despoils
man
of
all
the
praise
of
righteousness
and
ascribes
the
whole
to
the
grace
of
god
yet
he
refers
grace
to
sanctification
in
which
we
are
regenerated
by
the
spirit
to
newness
of
life
xvi
the
scripture
when
speaking
of
the
righteousness
of
faith
leads
us
to
something
very
different
it
teaches
us
that
being
diverted
from
the
contemplation
of
our
own
works
we
should
regard
nothing
but
the
mercy
of
god
and
the
perfection
of
christ
for
it
states
this
to
be
the
order
of
justification
that
from
the
beginning
god
deigns
to
embrace
sinful
man
with
his
pure
and
gratuitous
goodness
contemplating
nothing
in
him
to
excite
mercy
but
his
misery
for
god
beholds
him
utterly
destitute
of
all
good
works
deriving
from
himself
the
motive
for
blessing
him
that
he
may
affect
the
sinner
himself
with
a
sense
of
his
supreme
goodness
who
losing
all
confidence
in
his
own
works
rests
the
whole
of
his
salvation
on
the
divine
mercy
this
is
the
sentiment
of
faith
by
which
the
sinner
comes
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
salvation
when
he
knows
from
the
doctrine
of
the
gospel
that
he
is
reconciled
to
god
that
having
obtained
remission
of
sins
he
is
justified
by
the
intervention
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
and
though
regenerated
by
the
spirit
of
god
he
thinks
on
everlasting
righteousness
reserved
for
him
not
in
the
good
works
to
which
he
devotes
himself
but
solely
in
the
righteousness
of
christ
when
all
these
things
shall
have
been
particularly
examined
they
will
afford
a
perspicuous
explication
of
our
opinion
they
will
however
be
better
digested
in
a
different
order
from
that
in
which
they
have
been
proposed
but
it
is
of
little
importance
provided
they
are
so
connected
with
each
other
that
we
may
have
the
whole
subject
rightly
stated
and
well
confirmed
xvii
here
it
is
proper
to
recall
to
remembrance
the
relation
we
have
before
stated
between
faith
and
the
gospel
since
the
reason
why
faith
is
said
to
justify
is
that
it
receives
and
embraces
the
righteousness
offered
in
the
gospel
but
its
being
offered
by
the
gospel
absolutely
excludes
all
consideration
of
works
this
paul
very
clearly
demonstrates
on
various
occasions
and
particularly
in
two
passages
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
contrasting
the
law
and
the
gospel
he
says
moses
describeth
the
righteousness
which
is
of
the
law
that
the
man
which
doeth
those
things
shall
live
by
them
but
the
righteousness
which
is
of
faith
speaketh
on
this
wise
that
if
thou
shalt
confess
with
thy
mouth
the
lord
jesus
and
shalt
believe
in
thine
heart
that
god
hath
raised
him
from
the
dead
thou
shalt
be
do
you
perceive
how
he
thus
discriminates
between
the
law
and
the
gospel
that
the
former
attributes
righteousness
to
works
but
the
latter
bestows
it
freely
without
the
assistance
of
works
it
is
a
remarkable
passage
and
may
serve
to
extricate
us
from
a
multitude
of
difficulties
if
we
understand
that
the
righteousness
which
is
given
us
by
the
gospel
is
free
from
all
legal
conditions
this
is
the
reason
why
he
more
than
once
strongly
opposes
the
to
the
if
the
inheritance
be
of
the
law
it
is
no
more
of
promise
and
more
in
the
same
chapter
to
the
same
purpose
it
is
certain
that
the
law
also
has
its
promises
wherefore
unless
we
will
confess
the
comparison
to
be
improper
there
must
be
something
distinct
and
different
in
the
promises
of
the
gospel
now
what
can
that
be
but
that
they
are
gratuitous
and
solely
dependent
on
the
divine
mercy
whilst
the
promises
of
the
law
depend
on
the
condition
of
works
nor
let
any
one
object
that
it
is
only
the
righteousness
which
men
would
obtrude
on
god
from
their
own
natural
powers
and
that
is
rejected
since
paul
teaches
it
as
a
universal
truth
that
the
precepts
of
the
law
are
unprofitable
because
not
only
among
the
vulgar
but
even
among
the
very
best
of
men
there
is
not
one
who
can
fulfil
them
love
is
certainly
the
principal
branch
of
the
law
when
the
spirit
of
god
forms
us
to
it
why
does
it
not
constitute
any
part
of
our
righteousness
but
because
even
in
the
saints
it
is
imperfect
and
therefore
of
itself
deserves
no
reward
xviii
the
other
passage
is
as
follows
that
no
man
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
god
it
is
evident
for
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
and
the
law
is
not
of
faith
but
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
how
could
this
argument
be
supported
unless
it
were
certain
that
works
do
not
come
into
the
account
of
faith
but
are
to
be
entirely
separated
from
it
the
law
he
says
differs
from
faith
why
because
works
are
required
to
the
righteousness
of
the
law
it
follows
therefore
that
works
are
not
required
to
the
righteousness
of
faith
from
this
statement
it
appears
that
they
who
are
justified
by
faith
are
justified
without
the
merit
of
works
and
beyond
the
merit
of
works
for
faith
receives
that
righteousness
which
the
gospel
bestows
and
the
gospel
differs
from
the
law
in
this
respect
that
it
does
not
confine
righteousness
to
works
but
rests
it
entirely
on
the
mercy
of
god
he
argues
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
romans
that
abraham
had
not
whereof
to
glory
for
he
believed
god
and
it
was
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
and
by
way
of
confirmation
he
subjoins
that
then
there
is
room
for
the
righteousness
of
faith
when
there
are
no
works
which
merit
any
reward
he
tells
us
that
where
there
are
works
they
receive
a
reward
of
debt
but
that
what
is
given
to
faith
is
of
grace
for
this
is
the
clear
import
of
the
language
which
he
there
uses
when
he
adds
a
little
after
therefore
it
is
of
faith
that
we
obtain
the
inheritance
in
order
that
it
might
be
by
grace
he
infers
that
the
inheritance
is
gratuitous
because
it
is
received
by
faith
and
why
is
this
but
because
faith
without
any
assistance
of
works
depends
wholly
on
the
divine
mercy
and
in
the
same
sense
undoubtedly
he
elsewhere
teaches
us
that
the
righteousness
of
god
without
the
law
is
manifested
being
witnessed
by
the
law
and
the
prophets
because
by
excluding
the
law
he
denies
that
righteousness
is
assisted
by
works
or
that
we
obtain
it
by
working
but
asserts
that
we
come
empty
in
order
to
receive
it
xix
the
reader
will
now
discover
with
what
justice
the
sophists
of
the
present
day
cavil
at
our
doctrine
when
we
say
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
that
a
man
is
justified
they
do
not
deny
because
the
scripture
so
often
declares
it
but
since
it
is
nowhere
expressly
said
to
be
by
faith
only
they
can
not
bear
this
addition
to
be
made
but
what
reply
will
they
give
to
these
words
of
paul
where
he
contends
that
righteousness
is
not
of
faith
unless
it
be
gratuitous
how
can
any
thing
gratuitous
consist
with
works
and
by
what
cavils
will
they
elude
what
he
asserts
in
another
place
that
in
the
gospel
is
the
righteousness
of
god
revealed
if
righteousness
is
revealed
in
the
gospel
it
is
certainly
not
a
mutilated
and
partial
but
a
complete
and
perfect
one
the
law
therefore
has
no
concern
in
it
and
respecting
this
exclusive
particle
they
rest
on
an
evasion
which
is
not
only
false
but
glaringly
ridiculous
for
does
not
he
most
completely
attribute
every
thing
to
faith
alone
who
denies
every
thing
to
works
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
expressions
of
paul
righteousness
is
manifested
without
the
law
justified
freely
by
his
grace
justified
without
the
deeds
of
the
here
they
have
an
ingenious
subterfuge
which
though
it
is
not
of
their
own
invention
but
borrowed
from
origen
and
some
of
the
ancients
is
nevertheless
very
absurd
they
pretend
that
the
works
excluded
are
the
ceremonial
works
of
the
law
not
the
moral
works
they
have
made
such
a
proficiency
by
their
perpetual
disputations
that
they
have
forgotten
the
first
elements
of
logic
do
they
suppose
the
apostle
to
have
been
insane
when
he
adduced
these
passages
in
proof
of
his
doctrine
the
man
that
doeth
them
shall
live
in
them
and
cursed
is
every
one
that
continueth
not
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
if
they
be
in
their
sober
senses
they
will
not
assert
that
life
was
promised
to
the
observers
of
ceremonies
and
the
curse
denounced
merely
on
the
transgressors
of
them
if
these
places
are
to
be
understood
of
the
moral
law
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
moral
works
likewise
are
excluded
from
the
power
to
justify
to
the
same
purpose
are
these
arguments
which
he
uses
for
by
the
law
is
the
knowledge
of
sin
consequently
not
righteousness
because
the
law
worketh
wrath
therefore
not
righteousness
since
the
law
can
not
assure
our
consciences
neither
can
it
confer
righteousness
since
faith
is
counted
for
righteousness
consequently
righteousness
is
not
a
reward
of
works
but
is
gratuitously
bestowed
since
we
are
justified
by
faith
boasting
is
precluded
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life
verily
righteousness
should
have
been
by
the
law
but
the
scripture
hath
concluded
all
under
sin
that
the
promise
by
faith
of
jesus
christ
might
be
given
to
them
that
let
them
idly
pretend
if
they
dare
that
these
are
applicable
to
ceremonies
not
to
morals
but
even
children
would
explode
such
consummate
impudence
we
may
therefore
be
assured
that
when
the
power
of
justifying
is
denied
to
the
law
the
whole
law
is
included
xx
if
any
one
should
wonder
why
the
apostle
does
not
content
himself
with
simply
mentioning
but
says
of
the
the
reason
is
obvious
for
though
works
are
so
greatly
esteemed
they
derive
their
value
from
the
divine
approbation
rather
than
from
any
intrinsic
excellence
for
who
can
dare
to
boast
to
god
of
any
righteousness
of
works
but
what
he
has
approved
who
can
dare
to
claim
any
reward
as
due
to
them
but
what
he
has
promised
it
is
owing
therefore
to
the
divine
favour
that
they
are
accounted
worthy
both
of
the
title
and
of
the
reward
of
righteousness
and
so
they
are
valuable
only
when
they
are
intended
as
acts
of
obedience
to
god
wherefore
the
apostle
in
another
place
in
order
to
prove
that
abraham
could
not
be
justified
by
works
alleges
that
the
law
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
after
the
covenant
was
ignorant
persons
would
ridicule
such
an
argument
because
there
might
have
been
righteous
works
before
the
promulgation
of
the
law
but
knowing
that
works
have
no
such
intrinsic
worth
independently
of
the
testimony
and
esteem
of
god
he
has
taken
it
for
granted
that
antecedently
to
the
law
they
had
no
power
to
justify
we
know
why
he
expressly
mentions
the
works
of
the
law
when
he
means
to
deny
justification
by
works
it
is
because
they
alone
can
furnish
any
occasion
of
controversy
however
he
likewise
excludes
all
works
without
any
limitation
as
when
he
says
david
describeth
the
blessedness
of
the
man
unto
whom
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
they
can
not
therefore
by
any
subtleties
prevent
us
from
retaining
this
general
exclusive
particle
it
is
in
vain
also
that
they
catch
at
another
frivolous
subtlety
alleging
that
we
are
justified
only
by
that
faith
which
worketh
by
love
with
a
view
to
represent
righteousness
as
depending
on
love
we
acknowledge
indeed
with
paul
that
no
other
faith
justifies
except
that
which
worketh
by
love
but
it
does
not
derive
its
power
to
justify
from
the
efficacy
of
that
love
it
justifies
in
no
other
way
than
as
it
introduces
us
into
a
participation
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
otherwise
there
would
be
no
force
in
the
argument
so
strenuously
urged
by
the
apostle
to
him
that
worketh
says
he
is
the
reward
not
reckoned
of
grace
but
of
debt
but
to
him
that
worketh
not
but
believeth
on
him
that
justifieth
the
ungodly
his
faith
is
counted
for
was
it
possible
for
him
to
speak
more
plainly
than
by
thus
asserting
that
there
is
no
righteousness
of
faith
except
where
there
are
no
works
entitled
to
any
reward
and
that
faith
is
imputed
for
righteousness
only
when
righteousness
is
conferred
through
unmerited
grace
xxi
now
let
us
examine
the
truth
of
what
has
been
asserted
in
the
definition
that
the
righteousness
of
faith
is
a
reconciliation
with
god
which
consists
solely
in
remission
of
sins
we
must
always
return
to
this
the
divine
wrath
remains
on
all
men
as
long
as
they
continue
to
be
sinners
this
isaiah
has
beautifully
expressed
in
the
following
words
the
lord
s
hand
is
not
shortened
that
it
can
not
save
neither
is
his
ear
heavy
that
it
can
not
hear
but
your
iniquities
have
separated
between
you
and
your
god
and
your
sins
have
hid
his
face
from
you
that
he
will
not
we
are
informed
that
sin
makes
a
division
between
man
and
god
and
turns
the
divine
countenance
away
from
the
sinner
nor
can
it
be
otherwise
because
it
is
incompatible
with
his
righteousness
to
have
any
communion
with
sin
hence
the
apostle
teaches
that
man
is
an
enemy
to
god
till
he
be
reconciled
to
him
through
christ
whom
therefore
the
lord
receives
into
fellowship
him
he
is
said
to
justify
because
he
can
not
receive
any
one
into
favour
or
into
fellowship
with
himself
without
making
him
from
a
sinner
to
be
a
righteous
person
this
we
add
is
accomplished
by
the
remission
of
sins
for
if
they
whom
the
lord
has
reconciled
to
himself
be
judged
according
to
their
works
they
will
still
be
found
actually
sinners
who
notwithstanding
must
be
absolved
and
free
from
sin
it
appears
then
that
those
whom
god
receives
are
made
righteous
no
otherwise
than
as
they
are
purified
by
being
cleansed
from
all
their
defilements
by
the
remission
of
their
sins
so
that
such
a
righteousness
may
in
one
word
be
denominated
a
remission
of
sins
xxii
both
these
points
are
fully
established
by
the
language
of
paul
which
i
have
already
recited
god
was
in
christ
reconciling
the
world
unto
himself
not
imputing
their
trespasses
unto
them
and
hath
committed
unto
us
the
word
of
then
he
adds
the
substance
of
his
ministry
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
the
terms
righteousness
and
reconciliation
are
here
used
by
him
indiscriminately
to
teach
us
that
they
are
mutually
comprehended
in
each
other
and
he
states
the
manner
of
obtaining
this
righteousness
to
consist
in
our
transgressions
not
being
imputed
to
us
wherefore
we
can
no
longer
doubt
how
god
justifies
when
we
hear
that
he
reconciles
us
to
himself
by
not
imputing
our
sins
to
us
thus
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
the
apostle
proves
that
god
imputeth
righteousness
without
works
from
the
testimony
of
david
who
declares
blessed
are
they
whose
iniquities
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
are
covered
blessed
is
the
man
to
whom
the
lord
will
not
impute
by
blessedness
in
this
passage
he
undoubtedly
means
righteousness
for
since
he
asserts
it
to
consist
in
remission
of
sins
there
is
no
reason
for
our
adopting
any
other
definition
of
it
wherefore
zachariah
the
father
of
john
the
baptist
places
the
knowledge
of
salvation
in
the
remission
of
and
paul
observing
the
same
rule
in
the
sermon
which
he
preached
to
the
people
of
antioch
on
the
subject
of
salvation
is
stated
by
luke
to
have
concluded
in
the
following
manner
through
this
man
is
preached
unto
you
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
by
him
all
that
believe
are
justified
from
all
things
from
which
ye
could
not
be
justified
by
the
law
of
the
apostle
thus
connects
forgiveness
of
sins
with
justification
to
show
that
they
are
identically
the
same
whence
he
justly
argues
that
this
righteousness
which
we
obtain
through
the
favour
of
god
is
gratuitously
bestowed
upon
us
nor
should
it
be
thought
a
strange
expression
that
believers
are
justified
before
god
not
by
their
works
but
by
his
gracious
acceptance
of
them
since
it
occurs
so
frequently
in
the
scripture
and
sometimes
also
in
the
fathers
augustine
says
the
righteousness
of
the
saints
in
this
world
consists
rather
in
the
remission
of
their
sins
than
in
the
perfection
of
their
with
which
corresponds
the
remarkable
observation
of
bernard
not
to
sin
at
all
is
the
righteousness
of
god
but
the
righteousness
of
man
is
the
divine
grace
and
he
had
before
asserted
that
christ
is
righteousness
to
us
in
absolution
and
therefore
that
they
alone
are
righteous
who
have
obtained
pardon
through
his
xxiii
hence
also
it
is
evident
that
we
obtain
justification
before
god
solely
by
the
intervention
of
the
righteousness
of
christ
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
a
man
is
righteous
not
in
himself
but
because
the
righteousness
of
christ
is
communicated
to
him
by
imputation
and
this
is
a
point
which
deserves
an
attentive
consideration
for
it
supersedes
that
idle
notion
that
a
man
is
justified
by
faith
because
faith
receives
the
spirit
of
god
by
whom
he
is
made
righteous
which
is
too
repugnant
to
the
foregoing
doctrine
ever
to
be
reconcilable
to
it
for
he
must
certainly
be
destitute
of
all
righteousness
of
his
own
who
is
taught
to
seek
a
righteousness
out
of
himself
this
is
most
clearly
asserted
by
the
apostle
when
he
says
he
hath
made
him
to
be
sin
for
us
who
knew
no
sin
that
we
might
be
made
the
righteousness
of
god
in
we
see
that
our
righteousness
is
not
in
ourselves
but
in
christ
and
that
all
our
title
to
it
rests
solely
on
our
being
partakers
of
christ
for
in
possessing
him
we
possess
all
his
riches
with
him
nor
does
any
objection
arise
from
what
he
states
in
another
place
that
god
sending
his
own
son
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
for
sin
condemned
sin
in
the
flesh
that
the
righteousness
of
the
law
might
be
fulfilled
in
us
where
he
intends
no
other
fulfilment
than
what
we
obtain
by
imputation
for
the
lord
christ
so
communicates
his
righteousness
to
us
that
with
reference
to
the
divine
judgment
he
transfuses
its
virtue
into
us
in
a
most
wonderful
manner
that
the
apostle
intended
no
other
abundantly
appears
from
another
declaration
which
he
had
made
just
before
as
by
one
man
s
disobedience
many
were
made
sinners
so
by
the
obedience
of
one
shall
many
be
made
what
is
placing
our
righteousness
in
the
obedience
of
christ
but
asserting
that
we
are
accounted
righteous
only
because
his
obedience
is
accepted
for
us
as
if
it
were
our
own
wherefore
ambrose
appears
to
me
to
have
very
beautifully
exemplified
this
righteousness
in
the
benediction
of
jacob
that
as
he
who
had
on
his
own
account
no
claim
to
the
privileges
of
primogeniture
being
concealed
in
his
brother
s
habit
and
invested
with
his
garment
which
diffused
a
most
excellent
odour
insinuated
himself
into
the
favour
of
his
father
that
he
might
receive
the
benediction
to
his
own
advantage
under
the
character
of
another
so
we
shelter
ourselves
under
the
precious
purity
of
christ
our
elder
brother
that
we
may
obtain
the
testimony
of
righteousness
in
the
sight
of
god
the
words
of
ambrose
are
that
isaac
smelled
the
odour
of
the
garments
perhaps
indicates
that
we
are
justified
not
by
works
but
by
faith
since
the
infirmity
of
the
flesh
is
an
impediment
to
works
but
the
brightness
of
faith
which
merits
the
pardon
of
sin
conceals
the
error
of
our
and
such
is
indeed
the
real
fact
for
that
we
may
appear
before
the
face
of
god
to
salvation
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
be
perfumed
with
his
fragrance
and
to
have
all
our
deformities
concealed
and
absorbed
in
his
perfection
chapter
xii
a
consideration
of
the
divine
tribunal
necessary
to
a
serious
conviction
of
gratuitous
justification
though
it
appears
from
the
plainest
testimonies
that
all
these
things
are
strictly
true
yet
we
shall
not
clearly
discover
how
necessary
they
are
till
we
shall
have
taken
a
view
of
what
ought
to
be
the
foundation
of
all
this
argument
in
the
first
place
therefore
we
should
reflect
that
we
are
not
treating
of
the
righteousness
of
a
human
court
but
of
that
of
the
heavenly
tribunal
in
order
that
we
may
not
apply
any
diminutive
standard
of
our
own
to
estimate
the
integrity
of
conduct
required
to
satisfy
the
divine
justice
but
it
is
wonderful
with
what
temerity
and
presumption
this
is
commonly
decided
and
it
is
even
observable
that
no
men
give
us
more
confident
or
pompous
declamations
concerning
the
righteousness
of
works
than
those
who
are
notoriously
guilty
of
open
sins
or
addicted
to
secret
vices
this
arises
from
their
never
thinking
of
the
righteousness
of
god
the
smallest
sense
of
which
would
prevent
them
from
treating
it
with
such
contempt
and
certainly
it
is
exceedingly
undervalued
if
it
be
not
acknowledged
to
be
so
perfect
that
nothing
can
be
acceptable
to
it
but
what
is
absolutely
complete
and
immaculate
such
as
it
never
was
nor
ever
will
be
possible
to
find
in
fallen
man
it
is
easy
for
any
one
in
the
cloisters
of
the
schools
to
indulge
himself
in
idle
speculations
on
the
merit
of
works
to
justify
men
but
when
he
comes
into
the
presence
of
god
he
must
bid
farewell
to
these
amusements
for
there
the
business
is
transacted
with
seriousness
and
no
ludicrous
logomachy
practised
to
this
point
then
must
our
attention
be
directed
if
we
wish
to
make
any
useful
inquiry
concerning
true
righteousness
how
we
can
answer
the
celestial
judge
when
he
shall
call
us
to
an
account
let
us
place
that
judge
before
our
eyes
not
according
to
the
spontaneous
imaginations
of
our
minds
but
according
to
the
descriptions
given
of
him
in
the
scripture
which
represents
him
as
one
whose
refulgence
eclipses
the
stars
whose
power
melts
the
mountains
whose
anger
shakes
the
earth
whose
wisdom
takes
the
subtle
in
their
own
craftiness
whose
purity
makes
all
things
appear
polluted
whose
righteousness
even
the
angels
are
unable
to
bear
who
acquits
not
the
guilty
whose
vengeance
when
it
is
once
kindled
penetrates
even
to
the
abyss
of
hell
let
him
seat
himself
i
say
on
the
tribunal
to
examine
the
actions
of
men
who
will
present
himself
fearless
before
his
throne
who
shall
dwell
with
the
devouring
fire
saith
the
prophet
who
shall
dwell
with
everlasting
burnings
he
that
walketh
righteously
and
speaketh
uprightly
now
let
him
come
forward
whoever
he
is
but
this
answer
causes
not
one
to
appear
for
on
the
contrary
we
hear
this
fearful
speech
if
thou
lord
shouldst
mark
iniquities
o
lord
who
shall
stand
in
truth
all
must
speedily
perish
as
it
is
written
in
another
place
shall
mortal
man
be
more
just
than
god
shall
a
man
be
more
pure
than
his
maker
behold
he
put
no
trust
in
his
servants
and
his
angels
he
charged
with
folly
how
much
less
in
them
that
dwell
in
houses
of
clay
whose
foundation
is
in
the
dust
which
are
crushed
before
the
moth
they
are
destroyed
from
morning
to
again
behold
he
putteth
no
trust
in
his
saints
yea
the
heavens
are
not
clean
in
his
sight
how
much
more
abominable
and
filthy
is
man
which
drinketh
iniquity
like
water
i
confess
that
in
the
book
of
job
mention
is
made
of
a
righteousness
which
is
superior
to
the
observance
of
the
law
and
it
will
be
of
use
to
remember
this
distinction
because
though
any
one
could
satisfy
the
law
he
could
not
even
then
stand
the
scrutiny
of
that
righteousness
which
exceeds
all
comprehension
therefore
though
job
is
conscious
of
his
own
integrity
yet
he
is
mute
with
astonishment
when
he
sees
that
god
could
not
be
pleased
even
with
the
sanctity
of
angels
if
he
were
to
enter
into
a
strict
examination
of
their
works
i
shall
therefore
now
pass
over
that
righteousness
to
which
i
have
alluded
because
it
is
incomprehensible
and
content
myself
with
asserting
that
we
must
be
worse
than
stupid
if
on
an
examination
of
our
lives
by
the
rule
of
the
written
law
we
are
not
tormented
with
awful
dread
in
consequence
of
so
many
maledictions
which
god
has
designed
to
arouse
us
and
among
the
rest
this
general
one
cursed
be
he
that
confirmeth
not
all
the
words
of
this
law
to
do
in
short
this
whole
controversy
will
be
uninteresting
and
useless
unless
every
one
present
himself
as
a
criminal
before
the
celestial
judge
and
voluntarily
prostrate
and
humble
himself
in
deep
solicitude
concerning
his
absolution
ii
to
this
point
our
eyes
ought
to
have
been
raised
that
we
might
learn
rather
to
tremble
through
fear
than
to
indulge
in
vain
exultation
it
is
easy
indeed
while
the
comparison
is
made
only
between
men
for
every
man
to
imagine
himself
to
be
possessed
of
something
which
others
ought
not
to
contemn
but
when
we
ascend
to
the
contemplation
of
god
that
confidence
is
immediately
lost
and
the
case
of
our
soul
with
respect
to
god
is
similar
to
that
of
our
body
with
respect
to
the
visible
heavens
for
the
eye
as
long
as
it
is
employed
in
beholding
adjacent
objects
receives
proofs
of
its
own
perspicacity
but
if
it
be
directed
towards
the
sun
dazzled
and
confounded
with
his
overpowering
brightness
it
feels
no
less
debility
in
beholding
him
than
strength
in
the
view
of
inferior
objects
let
us
not
then
deceive
ourselves
with
a
vain
confidence
although
we
consider
ourselves
equal
or
superior
to
other
men
that
is
nothing
to
god
to
whose
decision
this
cause
must
be
submitted
but
if
our
insolence
can
not
be
restrained
by
these
admonitions
he
will
reply
to
us
in
the
language
which
he
addressed
to
the
pharisees
ye
are
they
which
justify
yourselves
before
men
but
that
which
is
highly
esteemed
among
men
is
abomination
in
the
sight
of
go
now
and
among
men
proudly
glory
in
your
righteousness
while
the
god
of
heaven
abominates
it
but
what
is
the
language
of
the
servants
of
god
who
are
truly
taught
by
his
spirit
one
says
enter
not
into
judgment
with
thy
servant
for
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
and
another
though
in
a
sense
somewhat
different
how
should
man
be
just
with
god
if
he
will
contend
with
him
he
can
not
answer
him
one
of
a
here
we
are
plainly
informed
respecting
the
righteousness
of
god
that
it
is
such
as
no
human
works
can
satisfy
and
such
as
renders
it
impossible
for
us
if
accused
of
a
thousand
crimes
to
exculpate
ourselves
from
one
of
them
the
same
idea
of
this
righteousness
had
very
properly
been
entertained
by
paul
that
chosen
vessel
of
god
when
he
professed
i
am
conscious
to
myself
of
nothing
yet
am
i
not
hereby
iii
nor
is
it
only
in
the
sacred
scriptures
that
such
examples
are
found
all
pious
writers
discover
similar
sentiments
thus
augustine
says
the
only
hope
of
all
the
pious
who
groan
under
this
burden
of
corruptible
flesh
and
amidst
the
infirmities
of
this
life
is
that
we
have
a
mediator
jesus
christ
the
righteous
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
observation
if
this
is
their
only
hope
where
is
any
confidence
in
works
for
when
he
asserts
this
to
be
the
only
one
he
precludes
every
other
bernard
also
says
and
in
fact
where
can
be
found
safe
and
solid
rest
and
security
for
the
weak
but
in
the
wounds
of
the
saviour
there
i
dwell
with
the
greater
security
in
proportion
to
his
power
to
save
the
world
rages
the
body
oppresses
the
devil
lies
in
wait
to
destroy
i
do
not
fall
because
my
foundation
is
on
a
firm
rock
i
have
committed
heinous
sin
my
conscience
is
disturbed
but
shall
not
fall
into
despair
because
i
shall
recall
to
remembrance
the
wounds
of
the
from
these
considerations
he
afterwards
concludes
my
merit
therefore
is
the
compassion
of
the
lord
i
am
clearly
not
destitute
of
merit
as
long
as
he
is
not
destitute
of
compassions
but
if
the
mercies
of
the
lord
be
a
multitude
of
mercies
my
merits
are
likewise
equally
numerous
shall
i
sing
of
my
own
righteousness
o
lord
i
will
remember
thy
righteousness
alone
for
it
is
mine
also
since
he
is
made
of
god
righteousness
unto
again
in
another
place
this
is
the
whole
merit
of
fix
all
his
hope
on
him
who
saves
the
whole
likewise
in
another
place
retaining
peace
to
himself
and
ascribing
the
glory
to
god
he
says
to
thee
let
the
glory
remain
undiminished
it
is
happy
for
me
if
i
have
peace
the
glory
i
entirely
renounce
lest
if
i
usurp
what
is
not
mine
i
lose
also
that
which
is
offered
in
another
place
he
is
still
more
explicit
why
should
the
church
be
solicitous
about
merits
while
it
has
a
stronger
and
more
secure
reason
for
glorying
in
the
designs
of
god
you
need
not
inquire
on
account
of
what
merits
we
hope
for
blessings
especially
when
you
read
in
the
prophet
thus
saith
the
lord
god
i
do
not
this
for
your
sakes
but
for
mine
holy
name
s
it
suffices
with
respect
to
merit
to
know
that
merits
are
not
sufficient
but
as
it
suffices
for
merit
not
to
presume
on
merits
so
to
be
destitute
of
merits
is
sufficient
cause
of
we
must
excuse
his
custom
of
freely
using
the
word
for
good
works
but
his
ultimate
design
was
to
terrify
hypocrites
who
indulge
themselves
in
a
licentious
course
of
sin
against
the
grace
of
god
as
he
presently
declares
happy
is
the
church
which
wants
neither
merits
without
presumption
nor
presumption
without
merits
it
has
some
ground
of
presumption
but
not
merits
it
has
merits
but
in
order
to
deserve
not
to
presume
is
not
the
absence
of
presumption
itself
a
merit
therefore
the
church
presumes
the
more
securely
because
it
does
not
presume
having
ample
cause
for
glorying
in
the
multitude
of
the
divine
iv
this
is
the
real
truth
the
troubled
conscience
finds
this
to
be
the
only
asylum
of
safety
where
it
can
enjoy
any
tranquillity
when
it
has
to
do
with
the
divine
justice
for
if
the
stars
which
appeared
most
brilliant
during
the
night
lose
their
splendour
on
the
rising
of
the
sun
what
can
we
suppose
will
be
the
case
with
the
most
excellent
innocence
of
man
when
compared
with
the
purity
of
god
for
that
will
be
an
examination
inconceivably
severe
which
shall
penetrate
into
all
the
most
secret
thoughts
of
the
heart
and
as
paul
says
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
and
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
hearts
which
shall
constrain
the
reluctant
conscience
to
confess
all
those
things
which
have
now
passed
away
even
from
our
own
remembrance
we
shall
be
urged
by
an
accusing
devil
who
has
been
privy
to
all
the
crimes
which
he
has
impelled
us
to
perpetrate
there
the
external
appearance
of
good
works
which
now
is
the
sole
object
of
esteem
will
be
of
no
avail
sincerity
of
heart
is
all
that
will
be
required
wherefore
hypocrisy
not
only
that
by
which
a
man
conscious
of
his
guilt
before
god
affects
ostentation
before
men
but
that
also
by
which
every
man
imposes
on
himself
before
god
for
we
are
all
prone
to
and
adulation
hypocrisy
in
all
its
forms
will
then
be
overwhelmed
with
confusion
however
it
may
now
be
intoxicated
with
presumption
and
pride
persons
who
never
look
forward
to
such
a
spectacle
may
indeed
delightfully
and
complacently
compose
for
themselves
a
temporary
righteousness
of
which
they
will
immediately
be
stripped
at
the
divine
judgment
just
as
immense
riches
accumulated
by
us
in
a
dream
vanish
as
soon
as
we
awake
but
they
who
inquire
seriously
and
as
in
the
presence
of
god
respecting
the
true
standard
of
righteousness
will
certainly
find
that
all
the
actions
of
men
if
estimated
according
to
their
intrinsic
worth
are
utterly
defiled
and
polluted
that
what
is
commonly
considered
as
righteousness
is
in
the
divine
view
nothing
but
iniquity
that
what
is
accounted
integrity
is
mere
pollution
and
that
what
is
reputed
glory
is
real
ignominy
from
this
contemplation
of
the
divine
perfection
let
us
not
be
unwilling
to
descend
to
take
a
view
of
ourselves
without
adulation
or
blind
for
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
we
are
so
extremely
blind
in
this
respect
since
not
one
of
us
is
sufficiently
cautious
of
that
pestilent
which
the
scripture
declares
to
be
naturally
inherent
in
us
all
every
way
of
man
says
solomon
is
right
in
his
own
again
all
the
ways
of
a
man
are
clean
in
his
own
but
what
follows
from
this
is
he
absolved
from
guilt
by
this
delusion
not
at
all
but
as
is
immediately
added
the
lord
weigheth
the
spirits
that
is
while
men
are
congratulating
themselves
on
account
of
the
external
mask
of
righteousness
which
they
wear
the
lord
is
at
the
same
time
weighing
in
his
own
balance
the
latent
impurity
of
their
hearts
since
we
are
so
far
from
deriving
any
advantage
therefore
from
such
blandishments
let
us
not
voluntarily
delude
ourselves
to
our
own
perdition
that
we
may
examine
ourselves
properly
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
summon
our
conscience
to
the
tribunal
of
god
for
we
have
the
greatest
need
of
his
light
in
order
to
detect
the
recesses
of
our
depravity
which
otherwise
are
too
deeply
concealed
for
then
only
shall
we
clearly
perceive
the
force
of
this
language
how
can
man
be
justified
with
who
is
corruption
and
a
worm
abominable
and
filthy
and
who
drinketh
iniquity
like
water
who
can
bring
a
clean
thing
out
of
an
unclean
not
then
also
we
shall
experience
what
job
said
concerning
himself
if
i
justify
myself
mine
own
mouth
shall
condemn
me
if
i
say
i
am
perfect
it
shall
also
prove
me
for
the
complaint
which
the
prophet
formerly
made
respecting
israel
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
is
applicable
not
only
to
one
period
of
time
but
to
all
ages
for
he
there
comprehends
all
to
whom
the
grace
of
redemption
was
to
extend
and
the
rigour
of
this
examination
ought
to
proceed
till
it
shall
have
filled
us
with
complete
consternation
and
thus
prepared
us
to
receive
the
grace
of
christ
for
he
is
deceived
who
supposes
himself
capable
of
this
enjoyment
without
having
first
been
truly
humbled
it
is
a
observation
that
god
resisteth
the
proud
and
giveth
grace
to
the
vi
but
what
means
have
we
of
humbling
ourselves
except
by
submitting
all
poor
and
destitute
to
the
divine
mercy
for
i
do
not
call
it
humility
if
we
suppose
that
we
have
any
thing
left
and
hitherto
they
have
taught
a
pernicious
hypocrisy
who
have
connected
these
two
we
should
entertain
humble
thoughts
of
ourselves
before
god
and
that
we
should
attach
some
dignity
to
our
own
righteousness
for
if
we
address
to
god
a
confession
which
is
contrary
to
our
real
sentiments
we
are
guilty
of
telling
him
an
impudent
falsehood
but
we
can
not
think
of
ourselves
as
we
ought
to
think
without
utterly
despising
every
thing
that
may
be
supposed
an
excellence
in
us
when
we
hear
therefore
from
the
psalmist
that
god
will
save
the
afflicted
people
but
will
bring
down
high
looks
let
us
consider
first
that
there
is
no
way
of
salvation
till
we
have
laid
aside
all
pride
and
attained
sincere
humility
secondly
that
this
humility
is
not
a
species
of
modesty
consisting
in
conceding
to
god
a
small
portion
of
what
we
might
justly
claim
as
they
are
called
humble
among
men
who
neither
haughtily
exalt
themselves
nor
behave
with
insolence
to
others
while
they
nevertheless
entertain
some
consciousness
of
excellence
this
humility
is
the
unfeigned
submission
of
a
mind
overwhelmed
with
a
weighty
sense
of
its
own
misery
and
poverty
for
such
is
the
uniform
description
of
it
in
the
word
of
god
when
the
lord
speaks
thus
in
zephaniah
i
will
take
away
out
of
the
midst
of
thee
them
that
rejoice
in
thy
pride
i
will
also
leave
in
the
midst
of
thee
an
afflicted
and
poor
people
and
they
shall
trust
in
the
name
of
the
lord
does
he
not
clearly
show
who
are
truly
humble
even
such
as
are
afflicted
with
a
knowledge
of
their
own
poverty
on
the
contrary
he
describes
the
proud
as
persons
rejoicing
because
this
is
the
usual
consequence
of
prosperity
but
to
the
humble
whom
he
intends
to
save
he
leaves
nothing
but
that
they
trust
in
the
name
of
the
thus
also
in
isaiah
to
this
man
will
i
look
even
to
him
that
is
poor
and
of
a
contrite
spirit
and
trembleth
at
my
again
thus
saith
the
high
and
lofty
one
that
inhabiteth
eternity
whose
name
is
holy
i
dwell
in
the
high
and
holy
place
with
him
also
that
is
of
a
contrite
and
humble
spirit
to
revive
the
spirit
of
the
humble
and
to
revive
the
heart
of
the
contrite
by
the
contrition
so
frequently
mentioned
we
must
understand
a
wounded
heart
which
prevents
a
man
from
rising
when
humbled
in
the
dust
with
such
contrition
must
our
heart
be
wounded
if
we
desire
according
to
the
declaration
of
the
lord
to
be
exalted
with
the
humble
if
this
be
not
the
case
we
shall
be
abased
by
the
powerful
hand
of
god
to
our
shame
and
disgrace
vii
and
not
content
with
mere
precepts
our
excellent
master
in
a
parable
as
in
a
picture
has
presented
us
with
an
example
of
genuine
humility
for
he
introduces
a
publican
who
standing
afar
off
would
not
lift
up
so
much
as
his
eyes
unto
heaven
but
smote
upon
his
breast
saying
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
we
must
not
conclude
these
not
presuming
to
look
upwards
standing
afar
off
smiting
upon
his
breast
and
confessing
himself
a
be
marks
of
feigned
modesty
we
may
be
certain
that
they
were
sincere
evidences
of
the
disposition
of
his
heart
to
him
our
lord
opposes
a
pharisee
who
said
god
i
thank
thee
that
i
am
not
as
other
men
are
extortioners
unjust
adulterers
or
even
as
this
publican
i
fast
twice
in
the
week
i
give
tithes
of
all
that
i
he
openly
confesses
the
righteousness
which
he
has
to
be
the
gift
of
god
but
because
he
confides
in
his
being
righteous
he
departs
from
the
presence
of
god
unacceptable
and
hateful
to
him
the
publican
acknowledging
his
iniquity
is
justified
hence
we
may
see
how
very
pleasing
our
humiliation
is
in
the
sight
of
god
so
that
the
heart
is
not
open
for
the
reception
of
his
mercy
unless
it
be
divested
of
all
idea
of
its
own
dignity
when
this
notion
has
occupied
the
mind
it
precludes
the
admission
of
divine
mercy
that
no
one
might
have
any
doubt
of
this
christ
was
sent
by
his
father
into
the
world
with
a
commission
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
to
bind
up
the
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
to
comfort
all
that
mourn
to
give
unto
them
beauty
for
ashes
the
oil
of
joy
for
mourning
the
garment
of
praise
for
the
spirit
of
in
pursuance
of
this
commission
he
invites
to
a
participation
of
his
benefits
none
but
those
who
labour
and
are
heavy
and
in
another
place
he
says
i
am
not
come
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
viii
therefore
if
we
would
obey
the
call
of
christ
let
us
dismiss
all
arrogance
and
carelessness
from
our
minds
the
former
arises
from
a
foolish
persuasion
of
our
own
righteousness
when
a
man
supposes
himself
to
be
possessed
of
any
thing
the
merit
of
which
can
recommend
him
to
god
the
latter
may
exist
without
any
consideration
of
works
for
multitudes
of
sinners
inebriated
with
criminal
pleasures
and
forgetful
of
the
divine
judgment
are
in
a
state
as
it
were
of
lethargic
insensibility
so
that
they
never
aspire
after
the
mercy
which
is
offered
to
them
but
it
is
equally
necessary
for
us
to
shake
off
such
stupidity
and
to
reject
all
confidence
in
ourselves
in
order
that
being
freed
from
every
incumbrance
we
may
hasten
to
christ
all
destitute
and
hungry
to
be
filled
with
his
blessings
for
we
shall
never
have
sufficient
confidence
in
him
unless
we
entirely
lose
all
confidence
in
ourselves
we
shall
never
find
sufficient
encouragement
in
him
unless
we
are
previously
dejected
in
ourselves
we
shall
never
enjoy
sufficient
consolation
in
him
unless
we
are
utterly
disconsolate
in
ourselves
we
are
prepared
therefore
to
seek
and
obtain
the
grace
of
god
discarding
at
the
same
time
all
confidence
in
ourselves
and
relying
solely
on
the
assurance
of
his
mercy
when
as
augustine
says
forgetting
our
own
merits
we
embrace
the
free
gifts
of
christ
because
if
he
sought
merits
in
us
we
should
not
come
to
his
free
with
him
bernard
fully
agrees
when
he
compares
proud
men
that
arrogate
ever
so
little
to
their
own
merits
to
unfaithful
servants
because
they
unjustly
claim
the
praise
of
the
grace
which
passes
through
them
just
as
though
a
wall
should
say
that
it
produces
the
sunbeams
which
it
receives
through
a
window
but
not
to
dwell
any
longer
on
this
we
may
lay
it
down
as
a
brief
but
general
and
certain
maxim
that
he
is
prepared
for
a
participation
of
the
benefits
of
divine
mercy
who
has
wholly
divested
himself
i
will
not
say
of
his
righteousness
which
is
a
mere
nullity
but
of
the
vain
and
airy
phantom
of
righteousness
for
as
far
as
any
man
is
satisfied
with
himself
so
far
he
raises
an
impediment
to
the
exercise
of
the
grace
of
god
chapter
xiii
two
things
necessary
to
be
observed
in
gratuitous
justification
here
are
two
things
to
which
we
must
always
be
particularly
attentive
to
maintain
the
glory
of
the
lord
unimpaired
and
undiminished
and
to
preserve
in
our
own
consciences
a
placid
composure
and
serene
tranquillity
with
regard
to
the
divine
judgment
we
see
how
frequently
and
solicitously
the
scripture
exhorts
us
to
render
ascriptions
of
praise
to
god
alone
when
it
treats
of
justification
and
indeed
the
apostle
assures
us
that
the
design
of
the
lord
in
conferring
righteousness
upon
us
in
christ
is
to
manifest
his
own
righteousness
the
nature
of
that
manifestation
he
immediately
subjoins
it
is
that
he
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
the
righteousness
of
god
we
see
is
not
sufficiently
illustrious
unless
he
alone
be
esteemed
righteous
and
communicate
the
grace
of
justification
to
the
unworthy
for
this
reason
it
is
his
will
that
every
mouth
be
stopped
and
all
the
world
become
guilty
before
him
because
as
long
as
man
has
any
thing
to
allege
in
his
own
defence
it
detracts
something
from
the
glory
of
god
thus
in
ezekiel
he
teaches
us
how
greatly
we
glorify
his
name
by
an
acknowledgment
of
our
iniquity
ye
shall
remember
your
ways
saith
he
and
all
your
doings
wherein
ye
have
been
defiled
and
ye
shall
loathe
yourselves
in
your
own
sight
for
all
your
evils
that
ye
have
committed
and
ye
shall
know
that
i
am
the
lord
when
i
have
wrought
with
you
for
my
name
s
sake
not
according
to
your
wicked
ways
nor
according
to
your
corrupt
if
these
things
are
contained
in
the
true
knowledge
of
god
that
humbled
with
a
consciousness
of
our
iniquity
we
should
consider
him
as
indulging
us
with
blessings
of
which
we
are
unworthy
why
do
we
attempt
to
our
own
serious
injury
to
pilfer
the
smallest
particle
of
the
praise
due
to
his
gratuitous
goodness
thus
also
when
jeremiah
proclaims
let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches
but
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
the
lord
does
he
not
suggest
that
the
glory
of
god
sustains
some
diminution
if
any
man
glory
in
himself
to
this
use
these
words
are
clearly
applied
by
paul
when
he
states
that
all
the
branches
of
our
salvation
are
deposited
with
christ
that
we
may
not
glory
except
in
the
lord
for
he
intimates
that
they
who
suppose
themselves
to
have
even
the
least
ground
for
glorying
in
themselves
are
guilty
of
rebelling
against
god
and
obscuring
his
glory
ii
the
truth
then
is
that
we
never
truly
glory
in
him
till
we
have
entirely
renounced
all
glory
of
our
own
on
the
converse
this
may
be
admitted
as
an
axiom
universally
true
that
they
who
glory
in
themselves
glory
in
opposition
to
god
for
paul
is
of
opinion
that
the
world
is
not
subject
to
the
judgment
of
god
till
men
are
deprived
of
all
foundation
for
glorying
therefore
isaiah
when
he
announces
that
in
the
lord
shall
all
the
seed
of
israel
be
justified
adds
also
and
shall
glory
as
though
he
had
said
that
the
end
of
god
in
justifying
the
elect
was
that
they
might
glory
in
himself
and
in
no
other
but
how
we
should
glory
in
the
lord
he
had
stated
in
the
preceding
verse
surely
shall
one
say
in
the
lord
have
i
righteousness
and
let
us
observe
that
what
is
required
is
not
a
simple
confession
but
a
confession
confirmed
by
an
oath
that
we
may
not
suppose
any
fictitious
pretence
of
humility
to
be
sufficient
here
let
no
one
plead
that
he
does
not
glory
at
all
when
without
arrogance
he
recognizes
his
own
righteousness
for
such
an
opinion
can
not
exist
without
generating
confidence
nor
confidence
without
being
attended
with
glorying
let
us
remember
therefore
in
the
whole
controversy
concerning
righteousness
that
this
end
must
be
kept
in
view
that
all
the
praise
of
it
may
remain
perfect
and
undiminished
with
the
lord
because
according
to
the
apostle
s
testimony
he
has
bestowed
his
grace
on
us
in
order
to
declare
his
righteousness
that
he
might
be
just
and
the
justifier
of
him
which
believeth
in
wherefore
in
another
place
after
having
declared
that
the
lord
has
conferred
salvation
on
us
in
order
to
display
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
his
grace
repeating
as
it
were
the
same
sentiment
he
adds
by
grace
are
ye
saved
through
faith
and
that
not
of
yourselves
it
is
the
gift
of
god
not
of
works
lest
any
man
should
and
when
peter
admonishes
us
that
we
are
called
to
the
hope
of
salvation
that
we
should
show
forth
the
praises
or
virtues
of
him
who
hath
called
us
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvellous
light
he
evidently
means
that
the
praises
of
god
alone
should
resound
in
the
ears
of
believers
so
as
to
impose
total
silence
on
all
the
presumption
of
the
flesh
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
is
that
man
can
not
without
sacrilege
arrogate
to
himself
the
least
particle
of
righteousness
because
it
is
so
much
detracted
and
diminished
from
the
glory
of
the
righteousness
of
god
iii
now
if
we
inquire
by
what
means
the
conscience
can
obtain
peace
before
god
we
shall
find
no
other
than
our
reception
of
gratuitous
righteousness
from
his
free
gift
let
us
always
remember
the
inquiry
of
who
can
say
i
have
made
my
heart
clean
i
am
pure
from
my
sin
it
is
certain
that
there
is
no
man
who
is
not
covered
with
infinite
pollution
let
a
man
of
the
most
perfect
character
then
retire
into
his
own
conscience
and
enter
into
a
scrutiny
of
his
actions
and
what
will
be
the
result
will
he
feel
a
high
degree
of
satisfaction
as
though
there
were
the
most
entire
agreement
between
god
and
him
or
will
he
not
rather
be
lacerated
with
terrible
agonies
on
perceiving
in
himself
such
ample
cause
for
condemnation
if
he
be
judged
according
to
his
works
if
the
conscience
reflect
on
god
it
must
either
enjoy
a
solid
peace
with
his
judgment
or
be
surrounded
with
the
terrors
of
hell
we
gain
nothing
therefore
in
our
discussions
of
this
point
unless
we
establish
a
righteousness
the
stability
of
which
will
support
our
souls
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
divine
judgment
when
our
souls
shall
possess
what
will
enable
them
to
appear
with
boldness
in
the
presence
of
god
and
to
await
and
receive
his
judgment
without
any
fear
then
and
not
before
we
may
be
assured
that
we
have
found
a
righteousness
which
truly
deserves
the
name
it
is
not
without
reason
therefore
that
this
subject
is
so
largely
insisted
on
by
the
apostle
whose
words
i
prefer
to
my
own
for
if
they
which
are
of
the
law
be
heirs
faith
is
made
void
and
the
promise
is
made
of
none
he
first
infers
that
faith
is
annulled
and
superseded
if
the
promise
of
righteousness
respect
the
merit
of
our
works
or
depend
on
our
observance
of
the
law
for
no
man
could
ever
securely
rely
on
it
since
he
never
would
be
able
to
determine
with
certainty
for
himself
that
he
had
fulfilled
the
law
as
in
fact
no
man
ever
does
completely
satisfy
it
by
any
works
of
his
own
not
to
seek
far
for
testimonies
of
this
fact
every
individual
may
be
his
own
witness
of
it
who
will
enter
unprejudiced
into
an
examination
of
himself
and
hence
it
appears
in
what
deep
and
dark
recesses
hypocrisy
buries
the
minds
of
men
while
they
indulge
themselves
in
such
great
security
and
hesitate
not
to
oppose
their
to
the
judgment
of
god
as
though
they
would
stop
the
proceedings
of
his
tribunal
but
believers
who
sincerely
examine
themselves
are
troubled
and
distressed
with
a
solicitude
of
a
very
different
nature
the
minds
of
men
universally
therefore
ought
to
feel
first
hesitation
and
then
despair
while
considering
every
one
for
himself
the
magnitude
of
the
debt
with
which
they
are
still
oppressed
and
their
immense
distance
from
the
conditions
prescribed
to
them
behold
their
confidence
already
broken
and
extinguished
for
to
confide
is
not
to
fluctuate
to
vary
to
be
hurried
hither
and
thither
to
hesitate
to
be
kept
in
suspense
to
stagger
and
finally
to
despair
but
it
is
to
strengthen
the
mind
with
content
certainty
and
solid
security
and
to
have
somewhat
upon
which
to
stand
and
to
rest
iv
he
adds
likewise
another
consideration
that
the
promise
would
be
void
and
of
none
effect
for
if
the
fulfilment
of
it
depend
on
our
merit
when
shall
we
have
made
such
a
progress
as
to
deserve
the
favour
of
god
besides
this
second
argument
is
a
consequence
of
the
former
since
the
promise
will
be
fulfilled
to
those
alone
who
shall
exercise
faith
in
it
therefore
if
faith
be
wanting
the
promise
will
retain
no
force
therefore
the
inheritance
is
of
faith
that
it
might
be
by
grace
to
the
end
the
promise
might
be
sure
to
all
the
for
it
is
abundantly
confirmed
when
it
depends
solely
on
the
divine
mercy
because
mercy
and
truth
are
connected
by
an
indissoluble
bond
and
whatever
god
mercifully
promises
he
also
faithfully
performs
thus
david
before
he
implores
salvation
for
himself
according
to
the
word
of
god
first
represents
it
as
originating
in
his
mercy
according
to
thy
word
unto
thy
servant
let
thy
tender
mercies
come
unto
me
that
i
may
and
for
this
there
is
sufficient
reason
since
god
has
no
other
inducement
to
promise
than
what
arises
from
his
mere
mercy
here
then
we
must
place
and
as
it
were
deeply
fix
all
our
hopes
without
regarding
our
own
works
or
seeking
any
assistance
from
them
nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
we
are
advancing
a
new
doctrine
for
the
same
conduct
is
recommended
by
augustine
christ
says
he
will
reign
in
his
servants
for
ever
god
has
promised
this
god
has
said
it
if
that
be
insufficient
god
has
sworn
it
since
the
promise
therefore
is
established
not
according
to
our
merits
but
according
to
his
mercy
no
man
ought
to
speak
with
anxiety
of
that
which
he
can
not
bernard
also
says
the
disciples
of
christ
asked
who
can
be
saved
he
replied
with
men
this
is
impossible
but
not
with
god
this
is
all
our
confidence
this
our
only
consolation
this
the
whole
foundation
of
our
hope
but
certain
of
the
possibility
what
think
we
of
his
will
who
knows
whether
he
deserve
love
or
hatred
who
has
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
has
been
his
counsellor
here
now
we
evidently
need
faith
to
help
us
and
his
truth
to
assist
us
that
what
is
concealed
from
us
in
the
heart
of
the
father
may
be
revealed
by
the
spirit
and
that
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
may
persuade
our
hearts
that
we
are
sons
of
god
that
he
may
persuade
us
by
calling
and
justifying
us
freely
by
faith
in
which
there
is
as
it
were
an
intermediate
passage
from
eternal
predestination
to
future
let
us
draw
the
following
brief
conclusion
the
scripture
declares
that
the
promises
of
god
have
no
efficacy
unless
they
be
embraced
by
the
conscience
with
a
steady
confidence
and
whenever
there
is
any
doubt
or
uncertainty
it
pronounces
them
to
be
made
void
again
it
asserts
that
they
have
no
stability
if
they
depend
on
our
works
either
therefore
we
must
be
for
ever
destitute
of
righteousness
or
our
works
must
not
come
into
consideration
but
the
ground
must
be
occupied
by
faith
alone
whose
nature
it
is
to
open
the
ears
and
shut
the
eyes
that
is
to
be
intent
only
on
the
promise
and
to
avert
the
thoughts
from
all
human
dignity
or
merit
thus
is
accomplished
that
remarkable
prophecy
of
zechariah
i
will
remove
the
iniquity
of
that
land
in
one
day
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
shall
ye
call
every
man
his
neighbour
under
the
vine
and
under
the
in
which
the
prophet
suggests
that
believers
enjoy
no
true
peace
till
after
they
have
obtained
the
remission
of
their
sins
for
this
analogy
must
be
observed
in
the
prophets
that
when
they
treat
of
the
kingdom
of
christ
they
exhibit
the
external
bounties
of
god
as
figures
of
spiritual
blessings
wherefore
also
christ
is
denominated
the
prince
of
peace
and
our
peace
because
he
calms
all
the
agitations
of
the
conscience
if
we
inquire
by
what
means
we
must
come
to
the
sacrifice
by
which
god
is
appeased
for
no
man
will
ever
lose
his
fears
who
shall
not
be
assured
that
god
is
propitiated
solely
by
that
atonement
which
christ
has
made
by
sustaining
his
wrath
in
short
we
must
seek
for
peace
only
in
the
terrors
of
christ
our
redeemer
but
why
do
i
use
such
an
obscure
testimony
paul
invariably
denies
that
peace
or
tranquillity
can
be
enjoyed
in
the
conscience
without
a
certainty
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
and
he
also
declares
whence
that
certainty
proceeds
it
is
because
the
love
of
god
is
shed
abroad
in
our
hearts
by
the
holy
ghost
as
though
he
had
said
that
our
consciences
can
never
be
satisfied
without
a
certain
persuasion
of
our
acceptance
with
god
hence
he
exclaims
in
the
name
of
all
believers
who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
which
is
in
christ
for
till
we
have
reached
that
port
of
safety
we
shall
tremble
with
alarm
at
every
slightest
breeze
but
while
god
shall
manifest
himself
as
our
shepherd
we
shall
fear
no
evil
even
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
whoever
they
are
therefore
who
pretend
that
we
are
justified
by
faith
because
being
regenerated
we
are
righteous
by
living
a
spiritual
life
they
have
never
tasted
the
sweetness
of
grace
so
as
to
have
confidence
that
god
would
be
propitious
to
them
whence
also
it
follows
that
they
know
no
more
of
the
method
of
praying
aright
than
the
turks
or
any
other
profane
nations
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
faith
is
not
genuine
unless
it
dictate
and
suggest
that
most
delightful
name
of
father
and
unless
it
open
our
mouth
freely
to
cry
abba
father
which
he
in
another
place
expresses
still
more
clearly
in
christ
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
by
the
faith
of
this
certainly
arises
not
from
the
gift
of
regeneration
which
being
always
imperfect
in
the
present
state
contains
in
itself
abundant
occasion
of
doubting
wherefore
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
this
remedy
that
believers
should
conclude
that
they
can
not
hope
for
an
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
on
any
other
foundation
but
because
being
ingrafted
into
the
body
of
christ
they
are
gratuitously
accounted
righteous
for
with
respect
to
justification
faith
is
a
thing
merely
passive
bringing
nothing
of
our
own
to
conciliate
the
favour
of
god
but
receiving
what
we
need
from
christ
footnotes
it
is
not
uncommon
among
persons
of
a
certain
class
to
represent
the
leading
principles
of
calvin
as
unfavourable
to
practical
religion
and
to
that
kind
of
preaching
which
is
adapted
to
affect
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
the
hearers
a
reference
to
the
most
able
and
intelligent
theologians
and
preachers
who
have
held
those
principles
and
upon
whom
they
may
reasonably
be
concluded
to
have
exerted
their
genuine
and
fullest
influence
will
amply
evince
the
inaccuracy
of
this
representation
of
the
excellent
divine
quoted
above
king
charles
was
wont
to
say
that
he
carried
his
ears
to
hear
other
preachers
but
his
conscience
to
hear
