preface
the
work
of
richard
stallman
literally
speaks
for
itself
from
the
documented
source
code
to
the
published
papers
to
the
recorded
speeches
few
people
have
expressed
as
much
willingness
to
lay
their
thoughts
and
their
work
on
the
line
such
one
can
pardon
a
momentary
refreshing
after
all
we
live
in
a
society
that
treats
information
especially
personal
information
as
a
valuable
commodity
the
question
quickly
arises
why
would
anybody
want
to
part
with
so
much
information
and
yet
appear
to
demand
nothing
in
return
as
we
shall
see
in
later
chapters
stallman
does
not
part
with
his
words
or
his
work
altruistically
every
program
speech
and
bon
mot
comes
with
a
price
albeit
not
the
kind
of
price
most
people
are
used
to
paying
i
bring
this
up
not
as
a
warning
but
as
an
admission
as
a
person
who
has
spent
the
last
year
digging
up
facts
on
stallman
personal
history
it
more
than
a
little
intimidating
going
up
against
the
stallman
oeuvre
never
pick
a
fight
with
a
man
who
buys
his
ink
by
the
barrel
goes
the
old
mark
twain
adage
in
the
case
of
stallman
never
attempt
the
definitive
biography
of
a
man
who
trusts
his
every
thought
to
the
public
record
for
the
readers
who
have
decided
to
trust
a
few
hours
of
their
time
to
exploring
this
book
i
can
confidently
state
that
there
are
facts
and
quotes
in
here
that
one
wo
find
in
any
slashdot
story
or
google
search
gaining
access
to
these
facts
involves
paying
a
price
however
in
the
case
of
the
book
version
you
can
pay
for
these
facts
the
traditional
manner
by
purchasing
the
book
in
the
case
of
the
electronic
versions
you
can
pay
for
these
facts
in
the
free
software

thanks
to
richard

for
having
the
guts
and
endurance
to
show
us
the
code
sam
williams
for
want
of
a
printer
i
fear
the
greeks
even
when
they
bring
gifts
the
aeneid
the
new
printer
was
jammed
again
richard
stallman
a
staff
software
programmer
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
artificial
intelligence
laboratory
ai
lab
discovered
the
malfunction
the
hard
way
an
hour
after
sending
off
a
file
to
the
office
laser
printer
stallman
broke
off
a
productive
work
session
to
retrieve
his
documents
upon
arrival
he
found
only
four
pages
in
the
printer
tray
to
make
matters
even
more
frustrating
the
four
pages
belonged
to
another
user
meaning
that
stallman
print
job
and
the
unfinished
portion
of
somebody
else
print
job
were
still
trapped
somewhere
within
the
electrical
plumbing
of
the
computer
network
waiting
for
machines
is
an
occupational
hazard
when
you
a
software
programmer
so
stallman
took
his
frustration
with
a
grain
of
salt
still
the
difference
between
waiting
for
a
machine
and
waiting
on
a
machine
is
a
sizable
one
it
was
the
first
time
he
been
forced
to
stand
over
the
printer
watching
pages
print
out
one
by
one
as
a
person
who
spent
the
bulk
of
his
days
and
nights
improving
the
efficiency
of
machines
and
the
software
programs
that
controlled
them
stallman
felt
a
natural
urge
to
open
up
the
machine
look
at
the
guts
and
seek
out
the
root
of
the
problem
unfortunately
stallman
skills
as
a
computer
programmer
did
not
extend
to
the
realm
as
freshly
printed
documents
poured
out
of
the
machine
stallman
had
a
chance
to
reflect
on
other
ways
to
circumvent
the
printing
jam
problem
how
long
ago
had
it
been
that
the
staff
members
at
the
ai
lab
had
welcomed
the
new
printer
with
open
arms
stallman
wondered
the
machine
had
been
a
donation
from
the
xerox
corporation
a
cutting
edge
prototype
it
was
a
modified
version
of
the
popular
xerox
photocopier
only
instead
of
making
copies
it
relied
on
software
data
piped
in
over
a
computer
network
to
turn
that
data
into
documents
created
by
engineers
at
the
xerox
palo
alto
research
facility
it
was
quite
simply
an
early
taste
of
the
revolution
that
would
seize
the
rest
of
the
computing
industry
by
the
end
of
the
decade
driven
by
an
instinctual
urge
to
play
with
the
best
new
equipment
programmers
at
the
ai
lab
promptly
integrated
the
new
machine
into
the
lab
sophisticated
computing
infrastructure
the
results
had
been
immediately
pleasing
unlike
the
lab
old
laser
printer
the
new
xerox
machine
was
fast
pages
came
flying
out
at
a
rate
of
one
per
second
turning
a
print
job
into
a
print
job
the
new
machine
was
also
more
precise
circles
came
out
looking
like
circles
not
ovals
straight
lines
came
out
looking
like
straight
lines
not
sine
waves
it
was
for
all
intents
and
purposes
a
gift
too
good
to
refuse
it
was
until
a
few
weeks
after
its
arrival
that
the
machine
flaws
began
to
surface
chief
among
the
drawbacks
was
the
machine
inherent
susceptibility
to
paper
jams
programmers
quickly
understood
the
reason
behind
the
flaw
as
a
photocopier
the
machine
generally
required
the
direct
oversight
of
a
human
operator
figuring
that
these
human
operators
would
always
be
on
hand
to
fix
a
paper
jam
if
it
occurred
xerox
engineers
had
devoted
their
time
and
energies
to
eliminating
other
pesky
problems
in
engineering
terms
user
diligence
was
built
into
the
system
in
modifying
the
machine
for
printer
use
xerox
engineers
had
changed
the
relationship
in
a
subtle
but
profound
way
instead
of
making
the
machine
subservient
to
an
individual
human
operator
they
made
it
subservient
to
an
entire
networked
population
of
human
operators
instead
of
standing
directly
over
the
machine
a
human
user
on
one
end
of
the
network
sent
his
print
command
through
an
extended
of
machines
expecting
the
desired
content
to
arrive
at
the
targeted
destination
and
in
proper
form
it
was
until
he
finally
went
to
check
up
on
the
final
output
that
he
realized
how
little
of
the
desired
content
had
made
it
through
stallman
himself
had
been
of
the
first
to
identify
the
problem
and
the
first
to
suggest
a
remedy
years
before
when
the
lab
was
still
using
its
old
printer
stallman
had
solved
a
similar
problem
by
opening
up
the
software
program
that
regulated
the
printer
on
the
lab
machine
stallman
could
eliminate
paper
jams
but
he
could
insert
a
software
command
that
ordered
the
to
check
the
printer
periodically
and
report
back
to
the
the
lab
central
computer
to
ensure
that
one
user
negligence
bog
down
an
entire
line
of
print
jobs
stallman
also
inserted
a
software
command
that
instructed
the
to
notify
every
user
with
a
waiting
print
job
that
the
printer
was
jammed
the
notice
was
simple
something
along
the
lines
of
the
printer
is
jammed
please
fix
it
and
because
it
went
out
to
the
people
with
the
most
pressing
need
to
fix
the
problem
chances
were
higher
that
the
problem
got
fixed
in
due
time
as
fixes
go
stallman
was
oblique
but
elegant
it
did
fix
the
mechanical
side
of
the
problem
but
it
did
the
next
best
thing
by
closing
the
information
loop
between
user
and
machine
thanks
to
a
few
additional
lines
of
software
code
ai
lab
employees
could
eliminate
the
or
minutes
wasted
each
week
in
running
back
and
forth
to
check
on
the
printer
in
programming
terms
stallman
fix
took
advantage
of
the
amplified
intelligence
of
the
overall
network
if
you
got
that
message
you
could
assume
somebody
else
would
fix
it
says
stallman
recalling
the
logic
you
had
to
go
to
the
printer
a
minute
or
two
after
the
printer
got
in
trouble
the
two
or
three
people
who
got
messages
arrive
to
fix
the
machine
of
those
two
or
three
people
one
of
them
at
least
would
usually
know
how
to
fix
the
problem
such
clever
fixes
were
a
trademark
of
the
ai
lab
and
its
indigenous
population
of
programmers
indeed
the
best
programmers
at
the
ai
lab
disdained
the
term
programmer
preferring
the
more
slangy
occupational
title
of
hacker
instead
the
job
title
covered
a
host
of
from
creative
mirth
making
to
the
improvement
of
existing
software
and
computer
systems
implicit
within
the
title
however
was
the
notion
of
yankee
ingenuity
to
be
a
hacker
one
had
to
accept
the
philosophy
that
writing
a
software
program
was
only
the
beginning
improving
a
program
was
the
true
test
of
a
hacker
more
on
the
term
hacker
see
appendix
b
such
a
philosophy
was
a
major
reason
why
companies
like
xerox
made
it
a
policy
to
donate
their
machines
and
software
programs
to
places
where
hackers
typically
congregated
if
hackers
improved
the
software
companies
could
borrow
back
the
improvements
incorporating
them
into
update
versions
for
the
commercial
marketplace
in
corporate
terms
hackers
were
a
leveragable
community
asset
an
auxiliary
division
available
at
minimal
cost
it
was
because
of
this
philosophy
that
when
stallman
spotted
the
defect
in
the
xerox
laser
printer
he
did
panic
he
simply
looked
for
a
way
to
update
the
old
fix
or
hack
for
the
new
system
in
the
course
of
looking
up
the
xerox
software
however
stallman
made
a
troubling
discovery
the
printer
did
have
any
software
at
least
nothing
stallman
or
a
fellow
programmer
could
read
until
then
most
companies
had
made
it
a
form
of
courtesy
to
publish
text
files
that
documented
the
individual
software
commands
that
told
a
machine
what
to
do
xerox
in
this
instance
had
provided
software
files
in
precompiled
or
binary
form
programmers
were
free
to
open
the
files
up
if
they
wanted
to
but
unless
they
were
an
expert
in
deciphering
an
endless
stream
of
ones
and
zeroes
the
resulting
text
was
pure
gibberish
although
stallman
knew
plenty
about
computers
he
was
not
an
expert
in
translating
binary
files
as
a
hacker
however
he
had
other
resources
at
his
disposal
the
notion
of
information
sharing
was
so
central
to
the
hacker
culture
that
stallman
knew
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
some
hacker
in
some
university
lab
or
corporate
computer
room
proffered
a
version
of
the
source
code
with
the
desired
files
after
the
first
few
printer
jams
stallman
comforted
himself
with
the
memory
of
a
similar
situation
years
before
the
lab
had
needed
a
program
to
help
the
work
more
efficiently
with
the
the
lab
hackers
were
more
than
up
to
the
task
but
stallman
a
harvard
alumnus
recalled
a
similar
program
written
by
programmers
at
the
harvard
department
the
harvard
computer
lab
used
the
same
model
computer
the
albeit
with
a
different
operating
system
the
harvard
computer
lab
also
had
a
policy
requiring
that
all
programs
installed
on
the
had
to
come
with
published
files
taking
advantage
of
his
access
to
the
harvard
computer
lab
stallman
dropped
in
made
a
copy
of
the
source
code
and
brought
it
back
to
the
ai
lab
he
then
rewrote
the
source
code
to
make
it
more
suitable
for
the
ai
lab
operating
system
with
no
muss
and
little
fuss
the
ai
lab
shored
up
a
major
gap
in
its
software
infrastructure
stallman
even
added
a
few
features
not
found
in
the
original
harvard
program
making
the
program
even
more
useful
we
wound
up
using
it
for
several
years
stallman
says
from
the
perspective
of
a
programmer
the
transaction
was
the
software
equivalent
of
a
neighbor
stopping
by
to
borrow
a
power
tool
or
a
cup
of
sugar
from
a
neighbor
the
only
difference
was
that
in
borrowing
a
copy
of
the
software
for
the
ai
lab
stallman
had
done
nothing
to
deprive
harvard
hackers
the
use
of
their
original
program
if
anything
harvard
hackers
gained
in
the
process
because
stallman
had
introduced
his
own
additional
features
to
the
program
features
that
hackers
at
harvard
were
perfectly
free
to
borrow
in
return
although
nobody
at
harvard
ever
came
over
to
borrow
the
program
back
stallman
does
recall
a
programmer
at
the
private
engineering
firm
bolt
beranek
newman
borrowing
the
program
and
adding
a
few
additional
features
which
stallman
eventually
reintegrated
into
the
ai
lab
own
archive
a
program
would
develop
the
way
a
city
develops
says
stallman
recalling
the
software
infrastructure
of
the
ai
lab
parts
would
get
replaced
and
rebuilt
new
things
would
get
added
on
but
you
could
always
look
at
a
certain
part
and
say
by
the
style
i
see
this
part
was
written
back
in
the
early
and
this
part
was
written
in
the
through
this
simple
system
of
intellectual
accretion
hackers
at
the
ai
lab
and

computer
scientists
at
uc
berkeley
working
in
cooperation
with
a
few
engineers
at
at
t
had
built
up
an
entire
operating
system
using
this
system
dubbed
unix
a
play
on
an
older
more
academically
respectable
operating
system
called
multics
the
software
system
was
available
to
any
programmer
willing
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
copying
the
program
onto
a
new
magnetic
tape
and
shipping
it
not
every
programmer
participating
in
this
culture
described
himself
as
a
hacker
but
most
shared
the
sentiments
of
richard
stallman
if
a
program
or
software
fix
was
good
enough
to
solve
your
problems
it
was
good
enough
to
solve
somebody
else
problems
why
not
share
it
out
of
a
simple
desire
for
good
karma
the
fact
that
xerox
had
been
unwilling
to
share
its
files
seemed
a
minor
annoyance
at
first
in
tracking
down
a
copy
of
the
files
stallman
says
he
did
even
bother
contacting
xerox
they
had
already
given
us
the
laser
printer
stallman
says
why
should
i
bug
them
for
more
when
the
desired
files
failed
to
surface
however
stallman
began
to
grow
suspicious
the
year
before
stallman
had
experienced
a
blow
up
with
a
doctoral
student
at
carnegie
mellon
university
the
student
brian
reid
was
the
author
of
a
useful
program
dubbed
scribe
one
of
the
first
programs
that
gave
a
user
the
power
to
define
fonts
and
type
styles
when
sending
a
document
over
a
computer
network
the
program
was
an
early
harbinger
of
html
the
lingua
franca
of
the
world
wide
web
in
reid
made
the
decision
to
sell
scribe
to
a
software
company
called
unilogic
his
career
ending
reid
says
he
simply
was
looking
for
a
way
to
unload
the
program
on
a
set
of
developers
that
would
take
pains
to
keep
it
from
slipping
into
the
public
domain
to
sweeten
the
deal
reid
also
agreed
to
insert
a
set
of
time
bombs
in
deactivated
freely
copied
versions
of
the
program
after
a
expiration
date
to
avoid
deactivation
users
paid
the
software
company
which
then
issued
a
code
that
defused
the
internal
feature
for
reid
the
deal
was
a
scribe
did
fall
into
the
public
domain
and
unilogic
recouped
on
its
investment
for
stallman
it
was
a
betrayal
of
the
programmer
ethos
pure
and
simple
instead
of
honoring
the
notion
of
alike
reid
had
inserted
a
way
for
companies
to
compel
programmers
to
pay
for
information
access
as
the
weeks
passed
and
his
attempts
to
track
down
xerox
source
code
hit
a
brick
wall
stallman
began
to
sense
a
similar
scenario
at
work
before
stallman
could
do
or
say
anything
about
it
however
good
news
finally
trickled
in
via
the
programmer
grapevine
word
had
it
that
a
scientist
at
the
department
at
carnegie
mellon
university
had
just
departed
a
job
at
the
xerox
palo
alto
research
center
not
only
had
the
scientist
worked
on
the
laser
printer
in
question
but
according
to
rumor
he
was
still
working
on
it
as
part
of
his
research
duties
at
carnegie
mellon
casting
aside
his
initial
suspicion
stallman
made
a
firm
resolution
to
seek
out
the
person
in
question
during
his
next
visit
to
the
carnegie
mellon
campus
he
did
have
to
wait
long
carnegie
mellon
also
had
a
lab
specializing
in
research
and
within
a
few
months
stallman
had
a
reason
to
visit
the
carnegie
mellon
campus
during
that
visit
he
made
sure
to
stop
by
the
department
department
employees
directed
him
to
the
office
of
the
faculty
member
leading
the
xerox
project
when
stallman
reached
the
office
he
found
the
professor
working
there
in
true
fashion
the
conversation
was
cordial
but
blunt
after
briefly
introducing
himself
as
a
visitor
from
mit
stallman
requested
a
copy
of
the
source
code
so
that
he
could
port
it
to
the
to
his
surprise
the
professor
refused
to
grant
his
request
he
told
me
that
he
had
promised
not
to
give
me
a
copy
stallman
says
memory
is
a
funny
thing
twenty
years
after
the
fact
stallman
mental
history
tape
is
notoriously
blank
in
places
not
only
does
he
not
remember
the
motivating
reason
for
the
trip
or
even
the
time
of
year
during
which
he
took
it
he
also
has
no
recollection
of
the
professor
or
doctoral
student
on
the
other
end
of
the
conversation
according
to
reid
the
person
most
likely
to
have
fielded
stallman
request
is
robert
sproull
a
former
xerox
parc
researcher
and
current
director
of
sun
laboratories
a
research
division
of
the
conglomerate
sun
microsystems
during
the
sproull
had
been
the
primary
developer
of
the
software
in
question
while
at
xerox
parc
around
sproull
took
a
faculty
research
position
at
carnegie
mellon
where
he
continued
his
work
amid
other
projects
the
code
that
stallman
was
asking
for
was
code
that
sproull
had
written
in
the
year
or
so
before
going
to
carnegie
mellon
recalls
reid
i
suspect
that
sproull
had
been
at
carnegie
mellon
less
than
a
month
before
this
request
came
in
when
asked
directly
about
the
request
however
sproull
draws
a
blank
i
ca
make
a
factual
comment
writes
sproull
via
email
i
have
absolutely
no
recollection
of
the
incident
with
both
participants
in
the
brief
conversation
struggling
to
recall
key
whether
the
conversation
even
took
hard
to
gauge
the
bluntness
of
sproull
refusal
at
least
as
recalled
by
stallman
in
talking
to
audiences
stallman
has
made
repeated
reference
to
the
incident
noting
that
sproull
unwillingness
to
hand
over
the
source
code
stemmed
from
a
nondisclosure
agreement
a
contractual
agreement
between
sproull
and
the
xerox
corporation
giving
sproull
or
any
other
signatory
access
the
software
source
code
in
exchange
for
a
promise
of
secrecy
now
a
standard
item
of
business
in
the
software
industry
the
nondisclosure
agreement
or
nda
was
a
novel
development
at
the
time
a
reflection
of
both
the
commercial
value
of
the
laser
printer
to
xerox
and
the
information
needed
to
run
it
xerox
was
at
the
time
trying
to
make
a
commercial
product
out
of
the
laser
printer
recalls
reid
they
would
have
been
insane
to
give
away
the
source
code
for
stallman
however
the
nda
was
something
else
entirely
it
was
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
xerox
and
sproull
or
whomever
the
person
was
that
turned
down
his
request
that
day
to
participate
in
a
system
that
until
then
had
encouraged
software
programmers
to
regard
programs
as
communal
resources
like
a
peasant
whose
irrigation
ditch
had
grown
suddenly
dry
stallman
had
followed
the
ditch
to
its
source
only
to
find
a
hydroelectric
dam
bearing
the
xerox
logo
for
stallman
the
realization
that
xerox
had
compelled
a
fellow
programmer
to
participate
in
this
newfangled
system
of
compelled
secrecy
took
a
while
to
sink
in
at
first
all
he
could
focus
on
was
the
personal
nature
of
the
refusal
as
a
person
who
felt
awkward
and
out
of
sync
in
most
encounters
attempt
to
drop
in
on
a
fellow
programmer
unannounced
had
been
intended
as
a
demonstration
of
neighborliness
now
that
the
request
had
been
refused
it
felt
like
a
major
blunder
i
was
so
angry
i
could
think
of
a
way
to
express
it
so
i
just
turned
away
and
walked
out
without
another
word
stallman
recalls
i
might
have
slammed
the
door
who
knows
all
i
remember
is
wanting
to
get
out
of
there
twenty
years
after
the
fact
the
anger
still
lingers
so
much
so
that
stallman
has
elevated
the
event
into
a
major
turning
point
within
the
next
few
months
a
series
of
events
would
befall
both
stallman
and
the
ai
lab
hacker
community
that
would
make
seconds
worth
of
tension
in
a
remote
carnegie
mellon
office
seem
trivial
by
comparison
nevertheless
when
it
comes
time
to
sort
out
the
events
that
would
transform
stallman
from
a
lone
hacker
instinctively
suspicious
of
centralized
authority
to
a
crusading
activist
applying
traditional
notions
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
to
the
world
of
software
development
stallman
singles
out
the
carnegie
mellon
encounter
for
special
attention
it
encouraged
me
to
think
about
something
that
already
been
thinking
about
says
stallman
i
already
had
an
idea
that
software
should
be
shared
but
i
was
sure
how
to
think
about
that
my
thoughts
were
clear
and
organized
to
the
point
where
i
could
express
them
in
a
concise
fashion
to
the
rest
of
the
world
although
previous
events
had
raised
stallman
ire
he
says
it
was
until
his
carnegie
mellon
encounter
that
he
realized
the
events
were
beginning
to
intrude
on
a
culture
he
had
long
considered
sacrosanct
as
an
elite
programmer
at
one
of
the
world
elite
institutions
stallman
had
been
perfectly
willing
to
ignore
the
compromises
and
bargains
of
his
fellow
programmers
just
so
long
as
they
did
interfere
with
his
own
work
until
the
arrival
of
the
xerox
laser
printer
stallman
had
been
content
to
look
down
on
the
machines
and
programs
other
computer
users
grimly
tolerated
on
the
rare
occasion
that
such
a
program
breached
the
ai
the
lab
replaced
its
venerable
incompatible
time
sharing
operating
system
with
a
commercial
variant
the
tops
for
and
his
hacker
colleagues
had
been
free
to
rewrite
reshape
and
rename
the
software
according
to
personal
taste
now
that
the
laser
printer
had
insinuated
itself
within
the
ai
lab
network
however
something
had
changed
the
machine
worked
fine
barring
the
occasional
paper
jam
but
the
ability
to
modify
according
to
personal
taste
had
disappeared
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
entire
software
industry
the
printer
was
a
call
software
had
become
such
a
valuable
asset
that
companies
no
longer
felt
the
need
to
publicize
source
code
especially
when
publication
meant
giving
potential
competitors
a
chance
to
duplicate
something
cheaply
from
stallman
viewpoint
the
printer
was
a
trojan
horse
after
a
decade
of
failure
privately
owned
hackers
would
use
the
term
proprietary
gained
a
foothold
inside
the
ai
lab
through
the
sneakiest
of
methods
it
had
come
disguised
as
a
gift
that
xerox
had
offered
some
programmers
access
to
additional
gifts
in
exchange
for
secrecy
was
also
galling
but
stallman
takes
pains
to
note
that
if
presented
with
such
a
quid
pro
quo
bargain
at
a
younger
age
he
just
might
have
taken
the
xerox
corporation
up
on
its
offer
the
awkwardness
of
the
carnegie
mellon
encounter
however
had
a
firming
effect
on
own
moral
lassitude
not
only
did
it
give
him
the
necessary
anger
to
view
all
future
entreaties
with
suspicion
it
also
forced
him
to
ask
the
uncomfortable
question
what
if
a
fellow
hacker
dropped
into
stallman
office
someday
and
it
suddenly
became
stallman
job
to
refuse
the
hacker
request
for
source
code
it
was
my
first
encounter
with
a
nondisclosure
agreement
and
it
immediately
taught
me
that
nondisclosure
agreements
have
victims
says
stallman
firmly
in
this
case
i
was
the
victim
my
lab
and
i
were
victims
it
was
a
lesson
stallman
would
carry
with
him
through
the
tumultuous
years
of
the
a
decade
during
which
many
of
his
mit
colleagues
would
depart
the
ai
lab
and
sign
nondisclosure
agreements
of
their
own
because
most
nondisclosure
aggreements
ndas
had
expiration
dates
few
hackers
who
did
sign
them
saw
little
need
for
personal
introspection
sooner
or
later
they
reasoned
the
software
would
become
public
knowledge
in
the
meantime
promising
to
keep
the
software
secret
during
its
earliest
development
stages
was
all
a
part
of
the
compromise
deal
that
allowed
hackers
to
work
on
the
best
projects
for
stallman
however
it
was
the
first
step
down
a
slippery
slope
when
somebody
invited
me
to
betray
all
my
colleagues
in
that
way
i
remembered
how
angry
i
was
when
somebody
else
had
done
that
to
me
and
my
whole
lab
stallman
says
so
i
said
you
very
much
for
offering
me
this
nice
software
package
but
i
ca
accept
it
on
the
conditions
that
you
asking
for
so
i
going
to
do
without
it
as
stallman
would
quickly
learn
refusing
such
requests
involved
more
than
personal
sacrifice
it
involved
segregating
himself
from
fellow
hackers
who
though
sharing
a
similar
distaste
for
secrecy
tended
to
express
that
distaste
in
a
more
morally
flexible
fashion
it
was
long
before
stallman
increasingly
an
outcast
even
within
the
ai
lab
began
billing
himself
as
the
last
true
hacker
isolating
himself
further
and
further
from
a
marketplace
dominated
by
proprietary
software
refusing
another
request
for
source
code
stallman
decided
was
not
only
a
betrayal
of
the
scientific
mission
that
had
nurtured
software
development
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
it
was
a
violation
of
the
golden
rule
the
baseline
moral
dictate
to
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
them
do
unto
you
hence
the
importance
of
the
laser
printer
and
the
encounter
that
resulted
from
it
without
it
stallman
says
his
life
might
have
followed
a
more
ordinary
path
one
balancing
the
riches
of
a
commercial
programmer
with
the
ultimate
frustration
of
a
life
spent
writing
invisible
software
code
there
would
have
been
no
sense
of
clarity
no
urgency
to
address
a
problem
others
were
addressing
most
importantly
there
would
have
been
no
righteous
anger
an
emotion
that
as
we
soon
shall
see
has
propelled
career
as
surely
as
any
political
ideology
or
ethical
belief
from
that
day
forward
i
decided
this
was
something
i
could
never
participate
in
says
stallman
alluding
to
the
practice
of
trading
personal
liberty
for
the
sake
of
description
of
the
nda
well
as
the
overall
culture
that
encouraged
such
ethically
suspect
in
the
first
place
i
decided
never
to
make
other
people
victims
just
like
i
had
been
a
victim

some
within

to

in

increasingly

the

has
become
the
proverbial
big
stick
even
companies
that
once
laughed
it
off
as

have
come
around
to
recognize
the
benefits
linux
the

most
popular

the

together
these
tools
form
the
components
of
a
free

operating

developed
nurtured

owned
by
the
worldwide
hacker
community
instead
of
viewing
this

as
a

companies
like
ibm
hewlett

sun
microsystems
have
come
to
rely
upon
it
selling
software
applications

built

they
also
come
to
rely

strategic

in

perennial
war
against
microsoft
the
redmond
company
that
for
better
or
worse
has
dominated
the
marketplace
since
the
late
as
owner
of
the
popular

microsoft
stands
to
lose
the
most

an
shift
to
the
gpl

almost
every

of

in
the

protected

reaffirming
the

or
at
the
very
least
reaffirming
microsoft
legal
ability
to
treat
it
as
such
from
the
microsoft
viewpoint
incorporating

protected
by
the
viral
gpl
into
the

colossus
would
be
the
software
equivalent
of
superman
downing
a
bottle
of

rival

could
suddenly

sell

rendering
the

the

added
mundie
it
also
fundamentally
undermines

in

portion

speech
stallman
summed
up
the
acronym
origin
we
hackers
always
look
for
a
funny
or
naughty
name
for
a
program
because
naming
a
program
is
half
the
fun
of
writing
the
program
we
also
had
a
tradition
of
recursive
acronyms
to
say
that
the
program
that
you
writing
is
similar
to
some
existing
program
i
looked
for
a
recursive
acronym
for
something
is
not
unix
and
i
tried
all
letters
and
discovered
that
none
of
them
was
a
word
i
decided
to
make
it
a
contraction
that
way
i
could
have
a
acronym
for
something
not
unix
and
i
tried
letters
and
i
came
across
the
word
gnu
that
was
it
although
a
fan
of
puns
stallman
recommends
that
software
users
pronounce
the
g
at
the
beginning
of
the
acronym
not
only
does
this
avoid
confusion
with
the
word
gnu
the
name
of
the
african
antelope
connochaetes
gnou
it
also
avoids
confusion
with
the

the
amalgamated
operating
system
built
around
the
linux
kernel
and
windows
over
the
last
years
reveals
the
wisdom
of
both
perspectives
nevertheless
the
battle
for
momentum
is
an
important
one
in
the
software
industry
even
powerful
vendors
such
as
microsoft
rely
on
the
support
of
software
developers
whose
tools
programs
and
computer
games
make
an
underlying
software
platform
such
as
windows
more
attractive
to
the
mainstream
consumer
citing
the
rapid
evolution
of
the
technology
marketplace
over
the
last
years
not
to
mention
his
own
company
admirable
track
record
during
that
period
mundie
advised
listeners
to
not
get
too
carried
away
by
the
free
software
movement
recent
momentum
two
decades
of
experience
have
shown
that
an
economic
model
that
protects
intellectual
property
and
a
business
model
that
recoups
research
and
development
costs
can
create
impressive
economic
benefits
and
distribute
them
very
broadly
such
admonitions
serve
as
the
backdrop
for
stallman
speech
today
less
than
a
month
after
their
utterance
stallman
stands
with
his
back
to
one

edgy

begin
if
the

two

have
brought
dramatic
changes

marketplace
they
have
brought

to

circulating
in

before

can
begin
the
baroque
rituals

formality
must
be
observed
appearance
merits
not
one
but
two
introductions
mike
uretsky
codirector
of
the
stern
school
center
for
advanced
technology
provides
the
first
the
role
of
a
university
is
to
foster
debate
and
to
have
interesting
discussions
uretsky
says
this
particular
presentation
this
seminar
falls
right
into
that
mold
i
find
the
discussion
of
open
source
particularly
interesting
before
uretsky
can
get
another
sentence
out
stallman
is
on
his
feet
waving
him
down
like
a
stranded
motorist
i
do
free
software
stallman
says
to
rising
laughter
open
source
is
a
different
movement
the
laughter
gives
way
to
applause
the
room
is
stocked
with
stallman
partisans
people
who
know
of
his
reputation
for
verbal
exactitude
not
to
mention
his
much
publicized
falling
out
with
the
open
source
software
proponents
most
have
come
to
anticipate
such
outbursts
the
same
way
radio
fans
once
waited
for
jack
benny
trademark
now
cut
that
out
phrase
during
each
radio
program
uretsky
hastily
finishes
his
introduction
and
cedes
the
stage
to
edmond
schonberg
a
professor
in
the
nyu
department
as
a
computer
programmer
and
gnu
project
contributor
schonberg
knows
which
linguistic
land
mines
to
avoid
he
deftly
summarizes
stallman
career
from
the
perspective
of
a
programmer
richard
is
the
perfect
example
of
somebody
who
by
acting
locally
started
thinking
globally
about
problems
concerning
the
unavailability
of
source
code
says
schonberg
he
has
developed
a
coherent
philosophy
that
has
forced
all
of
us
to
reexamine
our
ideas
of
how
software
is
produced
of
what
intellectual
property
means
and
of
what
the
software
community
actually
represents
schonberg
welcomes
stallman
to
more
applause
stallman
takes
a
moment
to
shut
off
his
laptop
rises
out
of
his
chair
and
takes
the
stage
at
first
stallman
address
seems
more
catskills
comedy
routine
than
political
speech
i
like
to
thank
microsoft
for
providing
me
the
opportunity
to
be
on
this
platform
stallman
wisecracks
for
the
past
few
weeks
i
have
felt
like
an
author
whose
book
was
fortuitously
banned
somewhere
for
the
uninitiated
stallman
dives
into
a
quick
free
software
analogy
he
likens
a
software
program
to
a
cooking
recipe
both
provide
useful
instructions
on
how
to
complete
a
desired
task
and
can
be
easily
modified
if
a
user
has
special
desires
or
circumstances
you
do
have
to
follow
a
recipe
exactly
stallman
notes
you
can
leave
out
some
ingredients
add
some
mushrooms
you
like
mushrooms
put
in
less
salt
because
your
doctor
said
you
should
cut
down
on
most
importantly
stallman
says
software
programs
and
recipes
are
both
easy
to
share
in
giving
a
recipe
to
a
dinner
guest
a
cook
loses
little
more
than
time
and
the
cost
of
the
paper
the
recipe
was
written
on
software
programs
require
even
less
usually
a
few
and
a
modicum
of
electricity
in
both
instances
however
the
person
giving
the
information
gains
two
things
increased
friendship
and
the
ability
to
borrow
interesting
recipes
in
return
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
if
recipes
were
packaged
inside
black
boxes
stallman
says
shifting
gears
you
could
see
what
ingredients
they
using
let
alone
change
them
and
imagine
if
you
made
a
copy
for
a
friend
they
would
call
you
a
pirate
and
try
to
put
you
in
prison
for
years
that
world
would
create
tremendous
outrage
from
all
the
people
who
are
used
to
sharing
recipes
but
that
is
exactly
what
the
world
of
proprietary
software
is
like
a
world
in
which
common
decency
towards
other
people
is
prohibited
or
prevented
with
this
introductory
analogy
out
of
the
way
stallman
launches
into
a
retelling
of
the
xerox
episode
like
the
recipe
analogy
the
story
is
a
useful
rhetorical
device
with
its
structure
it
dramatizes
just
how
quickly
things
can
change
in
the
software
world
drawing
listeners
back
to
an
era
before
shopping
microsoft
windows
and
oracle
databases
it
asks
the
listener
to
examine
the
notion
of
software
ownership
free
of
its
current
corporate
logos
stallman
delivers
the
story
with
all
the
polish
and
practice
of
a
local
district
attorney
conducting
a
closing
argument
when
he
gets
to
the
part
about
the
carnegie
mellon
professor
refusing
to
lend
him
a
copy
of
the
printer
source
code
stallman
pauses
he
had
betrayed
us
stallman
says
but
he
just
do
it
to
us
chances
are
he
did
it
to
you
on
the
word
you
stallman
points
his
index
finger
accusingly
at
an
unsuspecting
member
of
the
audience
the
targeted
audience
member
eyebrows
flinch
slightly
but
stallman
own
eyes
have
moved
on
slowly
and
deliberately
stallman
picks
out
a
second
listener
to
nervous
titters
from
the
crowd
and
i
think
mostly
likely
he
did
it
to
you
too
he
says
pointing
at
an
audience
member
three
rows
behind
the
first
by
the
time
stallman
has
a
third
audience
member
picked
out
the
titters
have
given
away
to
general
laughter
the
gesture
seems
a
bit
staged
because
it
is
still
when
it
comes
time
to
wrap
up
the
xerox
story
stallman
does
so
with
a
showman
flourish
he
probably
did
it
to
most
of
the
people
here
in
this
a
few
maybe
who
were
born
yet
in
stallman
says
drawing
more
laughs
that
because
he
had
promised
to
refuse
to
cooperate
with
just
about
the
entire
population
of
the
planet
earth
stallman
lets
the
comment
sink
in
for
a
he
had
signed
a
nondisclosure
agreement
stallman
adds
richard
matthew
stallman
rise
from
frustrated
academic
to
political
leader
over
the
last
years
speaks
to
many
things
it
speaks
to
stallman
stubborn
nature
and
prodigious
will
it
speaks
to
the
clearly
articulated
vision
and
values
of
the
free
software
movement
stallman
helped
build
it
speaks
to
the
software
programs
stallman
has
built
programs
that
have
cemented
stallman
reputation
as
a
programming
legend
it
speaks
to
the
growing
momentum
of
the
gpl
a
legal
innovation
that
many
stallman
observers
see
as
his
most
momentous
accomplishment
most
importantly
it
speaks
to
the
changing
nature
of
political
power
in
a
world
increasingly
beholden
to
computer
technology
and
the
software
programs
that
power
that
technology
maybe
that
why
even
at
a
time
when
most
stars
are
on
the
wane
stallman
star
has
grown
since
launching
the
gnu
project
in
stallman
has
been
at
turns
ignored
satirized
vilified
and
from
within
and
without
the
free
software
movement
through
it
all
the
gnu
project
has
managed
to
meet
its
milestones
albeit
with
a
few
notorious
delays
and
stay
relevant
in
a
software
marketplace
several
orders
of
magnitude
more
complex
than
the
one
it
entered
years
ago
so
too
has
the
free
software
ideology
an
ideology
meticulously
groomed
by
stallman
himself
to
understand
the
reasons
behind
this
currency
it
helps
to
examine
richard
stallman
both
in
his
own
words
and
in
the
words
of
the
people
who
have
collaborated
and
battled
with
him
along
the
way
the
richard
stallman
character
sketch
is
not
a
complicated
one
if
any
person
exemplifies
the
old
adage
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
it
stallman
i
think
if
you
want
to
understand
richard
stallman
the
human
being
you
really
need
to
see
all
of
the
parts
as
a
consistent
whole
advises
eben
moglen
legal
counsel
to
the
free
software
foundation
and
professor
of
law
at
columbia
university
law
school
all
those
personal
eccentricities
that
lots
of
people
see
as
obstacles
to
getting
to
know
stallman
really
are
stallman
strong
sense
of
personal
frustration
his
enormous
sense
of
principled
ethical
commitment
his
inability
to
compromise
especially
on
issues
he
considers
fundamental
these
are
all
the
very
reasons
richard
did
what
he
did
when
he
did
explaining
how
a
journey
that
started
with
a
laser
printer
would
eventually
lead
to
a
sparring
match
with
the
world
richest
corporation
is
no
easy
task
it
requires
a
thoughtful
examination
of
the
forces
that
have
made
software
ownership
so
important
in
society
it
also
requires
a
thoughtful
examination
of
a
man
who
like
many
political
leaders
before
him
understands
the
malleability
of
human
memory
it
requires
an
ability
to
interpret
the
myths
and
politically
laden
code
words
that
have
built
up
around
stallman
over
time
finally
it
requires
an
understanding
of
stallman
genius
as
a
programmer
and
his
failures
and
successes
in
translating
that
genius
to
other
pursuits
when
it
comes
to
offering
his
own
summary
of
the
journey
stallman
acknowledges
the
fusion
of
personality
and
principle
observed
by
moglen
stubbornness
is
my
strong
suit
he
says
most
people
who
attempt
to
do
anything
of
any
great
difficulty
eventually
get
discouraged
and
give
up
i
never
gave
up
he
also
credits
blind
chance
had
it
not
been
for
that
over
the
xerox
laser
printer
had
it
not
been
for
the
personal
and
political
conflicts
that
closed
out
his
career
as
an
mit
employee
had
it
not
been
for
a
half
dozen
other
timely
factors
stallman
finds
it
very
easy
to
picture
his
life
following
a
different
career
path
that
being
said
stallman
gives
thanks
to
the
forces
and
circumstances
that
put
him
in
the
position
to
make
a
difference
i
had
just
the
right
skills
says
stallman
summing
up
his
decision
for
launching
the
gnu
project
to
the
audience
nobody
was
there
but
me
so
i
felt
like
elected
i
have

richard
stallman
mother
alice
lippman
still
remembers
the
moment
she
realized
her
son
had
a
special
gift
i
think
it
was
when
he
was
eight
lippman
recalls
the
year
was
and
lippman
a
recently
divorced
single
mother
was
wiling
away
a
weekend
afternoon
within
the
family
tiny
apartment
on
manhattan
upper
west
side
leafing
through
a
copy
of
scientific
american
lippman
came
upon
her
favorite
section
the
martin
column
titled
mathematical
games
a
substitute
art
teacher
lippman
always
enjoyed
gardner
column
for
the
it
provided
with
her
son
already
ensconced
in
a
book
on
the
nearby
sofa
lippman
decided
to
take
a
crack
at
solving
the
week
feature
puzzle
i
was
the
best
person
when
it
came
to
solving
the
puzzles
she
admits
but
as
an
artist
i
found
they
really
helped
me
work
through
conceptual
barriers
lippman
says
her
attempt
to
solve
the
puzzle
met
an
immediate
brick
wall
about
to
throw
the
magazine
down
in
disgust
lippman
was
surprised
by
a
gentle
tug
on
her
shirt
sleeve
it
was
richard
she
recalls
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
needed
any
help
looking
back
and
forth
between
the
puzzle
and
her
son
lippman
says
she
initially
regarded
the
offer
with
skepticism
i
asked
richard
if
he
read
the
magazine
she
says
he
told
me
that
yes
he
had
and
what
more
he
already
solved
the
puzzle
the
next
thing
i
know
he
starts
explaining
to
me
how
to
solve
it
hearing
the
logic
of
her
son
approach
skepticism
quickly
gave
way
to
incredulity
i
mean
i
always
knew
he
was
a
bright
boy
she
says
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
seen
anything
that
suggested
how
advanced
he
really
was
thirty
years
after
the
fact
lippman
punctuates
the
memory
with
a
laugh
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
i
ever
figured
out
how
to
solve
that
puzzle
she
says
all
i
remember
is
being
amazed
he
knew
the
answer
seated
at
the
table
of
her
second
manhattan
same
spacious
complex
she
and
her
son
moved
to
following
her
marriage
to
maurice
lippman
now
lippman
exudes
a
jewish
mother
mixture
of
pride
and
bemusement
when
recalling
her
son
early
years
the
nearby
credenza
offers
an

glowering
in
full
beard
and

robes

of

nephews
but
before
a
visitor
can
make
too
much
of
it
lippman
makes
sure
to
balance
its
prominent
placement
with
an
ironic
wisecrack
richard
insisted
i
have
it
after
he
received
his
honorary
doctorate
at
the
university
of
glasgow
says
lippman
he
said
to
me
what
mom
it
the
first
graduation
i
ever
attended
such
comments
reflect
the
sense
of
humor
that
comes
with
raising
a
child
prodigy
make
no
mistake
for
every
story
lippman
hears
and
reads
about
her
stubbornness
and
unusual
behavior
she
can
deliver
at
least
a
dozen
in
return
he
used
to
be
so
conservative
she
says
throwing
up
her
hands
in
mock
exasperation
we
used
to
have
the
worst
arguments
right
here
at
this
table
i
was
part
of
the
first
group
of
public
city
school
teachers
that
struck
to
form
a
union
and
richard
was
very
angry
with
me
he
saw
unions
as
corrupt
he
was
also
very
opposed
to
social
security
he
thought
people
could
make
much
more
money
investing
it
on
their
own
who
knew
that
within
years
he
would
become
so
idealistic
all
i
remember
is
his
stepsister
coming
to
me
and
saying
is
he
going
to
be
when
he
grows
up
a
fascist
as
a
single
parent
for
nearly
a
and
richard
father
daniel
stallman
were
married
in
divorced
in
and
split
custody
of
their
son
can
attest
to
her
son
aversion
to
authority
she
can
also
attest
to
her
son
lust
for
knowledge
it
was
during
the
times
when
the
two
forces
intertwined
lippman
says
that
she
and
her
son
experienced
their
biggest
battles
it
was
like
he
never
wanted
to
eat
says
lippman
recalling
the
behavior
pattern
that
set
in
around
age
eight
and
did
let
up
until
her
son
graduation
in
i
call
him
for
dinner
and
never
hear
me
i
have
to
call
him
or
times
just
to
get
his
attention
he
was
totally
immersed
stallman
for
his
part
remembers
things
in
a
similar
fashion
albeit
with
a
political
twist
i
enjoyed
reading
he
says
if
i
wanted
to
read
and
my
mother
told
me
to
go
to
the
kitchen
and
eat
or
go
to
sleep
i
was
going
to
listen
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
could
read
no
reason
why
she
should
be
able
to
tell
me
what
to
do
period
essentially
what
i
had
read
about
ideas
such
as
democracy
and
individual
freedom
i
applied
to
myself
i
did
see
any
reason
to
exclude
children
from
these
principles
the
belief
in
individual
freedom
over
arbitrary
authority
extended
to
school
as
well
two
years
ahead
of
his
classmates
by
age
stallman
endured
all
the
usual
frustrations
of
a
gifted
student
it
was
long
after
the
puzzle
incident
that
his
mother
attended
the
first
in
what
would
become
a
long
string
of
conferences
he
absolutely
refused
to
write
papers
says
lippman
recalling
an
early
controversy
i
think
the
last
paper
he
wrote
before
his
senior
year
in
high
school
was
an
essay
on
the
history
of
the
number
system
in
the
west
for
a
teacher
gifted
in
anything
that
required
analytical
thinking
stallman
gravitated
toward
math
and
science
at
the
expense
of
his
other
studies
what
some
teachers
saw
as
however
lippman
saw
as
impatience
math
and
science
offered
simply
too
much
opportunity
to
learn
especially
in
comparison
to
subjects
and
pursuits
for
which
her
son
seemed
less
naturally
inclined
around
age
or
when
the
boys
in
stallman
class
began
playing
a
regular
game
of
touch
football
she
remembers
her
son
coming
home
in
a
rage
he
wanted
to
play
so
badly
but
he
just
did
have
the
coordination
skills
lippman
recalls
it
made
him
so
angry
the
anger
eventually
drove
her
son
to
focus
on
math
and
science
all
the
more
even
in
the
realm
of
science
however
her
son
impatience
could
be
problematic
poring
through
calculus
textbooks
by
age
seven
stallman
saw
little
need
to
dumb
down
his
discourse
for
adults
sometime
during
his
years
lippman
hired
a
student
from
nearby
columbia
university
to
play
big
brother
to
her
son
the
student
left
the
family
apartment
after
the
first
session
and
never
came
back
i
think
what
richard
was
talking
about
went
over
his
head
lippman
speculates
another
favorite
maternal
anecdote
dates
back
to
the
early
shortly
after
the
puzzle
incident
around
age
seven
two
years
after
the
divorce
and
relocation
from
queens
richard
took
up
the
hobby
of
launching
model
rockets
in
nearby
riverside
drive
park
what
started
as
aimless
fun
soon
took
on
an
earnest
edge
as
her
son
began
recording
the
data
from
each
launch
like
the
interest
in
mathematical
games
the
pursuit
drew
little
attention
until
one
day
just
before
a
major
nasa
launch
lippman
checked
in
on
her
son
to
see
if
he
wanted
to
watch
he
was
fuming
lippman
says
all
he
could
say
to
me
was
i
not
published
yet
apparently
he
had
something
that
he
really
wanted
to
show
nasa
such
anecdotes
offer
early
evidence
of
the
intensity
that
would
become
stallman
chief
trademark
throughout
life
when
other
kids
came
to
the
table
stallman
stayed
in
his
room
and
read
when
other
kids
played
johnny
unitas
stallman
played
werner
von
braun
i
was
weird
stallman
says
summing
up
his
early
years
succinctly
in
a
interview
after
a
certain
age
the
only
friends
i
had
were
teachers

this
interview
is
one
of
the
most
candid
stallman
interviews
on
the
record
i
recommend
it
highly
http
although
it
meant
courting
more
at
school
lippman
decided
to
indulge
her
son
passion
by
age
richard
was
attending
science
camps
during
the
summer
and
private
school
during
the
school
year
when
a
teacher
recommended
her
son
enroll
in
the
columbia
science
honors
program
a
program
designed
for
gifted
and
students
in
new
york
city
stallman
added
to
his
extracurriculars
and
was
soon
commuting
uptown
to
the
columbia
university
campus
on
saturdays
dan

a
fellow
classmate
in
the
columbia
science
honors
program
recalls
richard
stallman
seeming
a
bit
weird
even
among
the
students
who
shared
a
similar
lust
for
math
and
science
we
were
all
geeks
and
nerds
but
he
was
unusually
poorly
adjusted
recalls
chess
now
a
mathematics
professor
at
hunter
college
he
was
also
smart
as
shit
i
known
a
lot
of
smart
people
but
i
think
he
was
the
smartest
person
i
ever
known
seth
breidbart
a
fellow
columbia

honors
program
alumnus
offers
bolstering
testimony
a
computer
programmer
who
has
kept
in
touch
with
stallman
thanks
to
a
shared
passion
for
science
fiction
and
conventions
he
recalls
the
stallman
as
scary
especially
to
a
fellow
it
hard
to
describe
breidbart
says
it
like
he
was
unapproachable
he
was
just
very
intense
he
was
very
knowledgeable
but
also
very
hardheaded
in
some
ways
such
descriptions
give
rise
to
speculation
are
adjectives
like
intense
and
hardheaded
simply
a
way
to
describe
traits
that
today
might
be
categorized
under
juvenile
behavioral
disorder
a
december
wired
magazine
article
titled
the
geek
syndrome
paints
the
portrait
of
several
scientifically
gifted
children
diagnosed
with
autism
or
asperger
syndrome
in
many
ways
the
parental
recollections
recorded
in
the
wired
article
are
eerily
similar
to
the
ones
offered
by
lippman
even
stallman
has
indulged
in
psychiatric
revisionism
from
time
to
time
during
a
profile
for
the
toronto
star
stallman
described
himself
to
an
interviewer
as
borderline
autistic
see
judy
steed
toronto

business
october
his
vision
of
free
software
and
social
cooperation
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
isolated
nature
of
his
private
life
a
glenn
eccentric
the
canadian
pianist
was
similarly
brilliant
articulate
and
lonely
stallman
considers
himself
afflicted
to
some
degree
by
autism
a
condition
that
he
says
makes
it
difficult
for
him
to
interact
with
people
a
description
that
goes
a
long
way
toward
explaining
a
lifelong
tendency
toward
social
and
emotional
isolation
and
the
equally
lifelong
effort
to
overcome
it
such
speculation
benefits
from
the
fast
and
loose
nature
of
most
behavioral
disorders
nowadays
of
course
as
steve
silberman
author
of
the
geek
syndrome
notes
american
psychiatrists
have
only
recently
come
to
accept
asperger
syndrome
as
a
valid
umbrella
term
covering
a
wide
set
of
behavioral
traits
the
traits
range
from
poor
motor
skills
and
poor
socialization
to
high
intelligence
and
an
almost
obsessive
affinity

wired
december
reflecting
on
the
broad
nature
of
this
umbrella
stallman
says
its
possible
that
if
born
years
later
he
might
have
merited
just
such
a
diagnosis
then
again
so
would
many
of
his
colleagues
it
possible
i
could
have
had
something
like
that
he
says
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
aspects
of
that
syndrome
is
difficulty
following
rhythms
i
can
dance
in
fact
i
love
following
the
most
complicated
rhythms
it
not
clear
cut
enough
to
know
chess
for
one
rejects
such
attempts
at
i
never
thought
of
him
as
having
that
sort
of
thing
he
says
he
was
just
very
unsocialized
but
then
we
all
were
lippman
on
the
other
hand
entertains
the
possibility
she
recalls
a
few
stories
from
her
son
infancy
however
that
provide
fodder
for
speculation
a
prominent
symptom
of
autism
is
an
oversensitivity
to
noises
and
colors
and
lippman
recalls
two
anecdotes
that
stand
out
in
this
regard
when
richard
was
an
infant
we
take
him
to
the
beach
she
says
he
would
start
screaming
two
or
three
blocks
before
we
reached
the
surf
it
was
until
the
third
time
that
we
figured
out
what
was
going
on
the
sound
of
the
surf
was
hurting
his
ears
she
also
recalls
a
similar
screaming
reaction
in
relation
to
color
my
mother
had
bright
red
hair
and
every
time
she
stoop
down
to
pick
him
up
he
let
out
a
wail
in
recent
years
lippman
says
she
has
taken
to
reading
books
about
autism
and
believes
that
such
episodes
were
more
than
coincidental
i
do
feel
that
richard
had
some
of
the
qualities
of
an
autistic
child
she
says
i
regret
that
so
little
was
known
about
autism
back
then
over
time
however
lippman
says
her
son
learned
to
adjust
by
age
seven
she
says
her
son
had
become
fond
of
standing
at
the
front
window
of
subway
trains
mapping
out
and
memorizing
the
labyrinthian
system
of
railroad
tracks
underneath
the
city
it
was
a
hobby
that
relied
on
an
ability
to
accommodate
the
loud
noises
that
accompanied
each
train
ride
only
the
initial
noise
seemed
to
bother
him
says
lippman
it
was
as
if
he
got
shocked
by
the
sound
but
his
nerves
learned
how
to
make
the
adjustment
for
the
most
part
lippman
recalls
her
son
exhibiting
the
excitement
energy
and
social
skills
of
any
normal
boy
it
was
until
after
a
series
of
traumatic
events
battered
the
stallman
household
she
says
that
her
son
became
introverted
and
emotionally
distant
the
first
traumatic
event
was
the
divorce
of
alice
and
daniel
stallman
richard
father
although
lippman
says
both
she
and
her
tried
to
prepare
their
son
for
the
blow
she
says
the
blow
was
devastating
nonetheless
he
sort
of
did
pay
attention
when
we
first
told
him
what
was
happening
lippman
recalls
but
the
reality
smacked
him
in
the
face
when
he
and
i
moved
into
a
new
apartment
the
first
thing
he
said
was
dad
furniture
for
the
next
decade
stallman
would
spend
his
weekdays
at
his
mother
apartment
in
manhattan
and
his
weekends
at
his
father
home
in
queens
the
shuttling
back
and
forth
gave
him
a
chance
to
study
a
pair
of
contrasting
parenting
styles
that
to
this
day
leaves
stallman
firmly
opposed
to
the
idea
of
raising
children
himself
speaking
about
his
father
a
world
war
ii
vet
who
passed
away
in
early
stallman
balances
respect
with
anger
on
one
hand
there
is
the
man
whose
moral
commitment
led
him
to
learn
french
just
so
he
could
be
more
helpful
to
allies
when
they
finally
come
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
parent
who
always
knew
how
to
craft
a
for
cruel
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
interview
daniel
stallman
for
this
book
during
the
early
research
for
this
book
stallman
informed
me
that
his
father
suffered
from
alzheimer
when
i
resumed
research
in
late
i
learned
sadly
that
daniel
stallman
had
died
earlier
in
the
year
my
father
had
a
horrible
temper
stallman
says
he
never
screamed
but
he
always
found
a
way
to
criticize
you
in
a
cold
way
as
for
life
in
his
mother
apartment
stallman
is
less
equivocal
that
was
war
he
says
i
used
to
say
in
my
misery
want
to
go
home
meaning
to
the
nonexistent
place
that
i
never
have
for
the
first
few
years
after
the
divorce
stallman
found
the
tranquility
that
eluded
him
in
the
home
of
his
paternal
grandparents
then
around
age
his
grandparents
passed
away
in
short
succession
for
stallman
the
loss
was
devastating
i
used
to
go
and
visit
and
feel
i
was
in
a
loving
gentle
environment
stallman
recalls
it
was
the
only
place
i
ever
found
one
until
i
went
away
to
college
lippman
lists
the
death
of
richard
paternal
grandparents
as
the
second
traumatic
event
it
really
upset
him
she
says
he
was
very
close
to
both
his
grandparents
before
they
died
he
was
very
outgoing
almost
a
type
with
the
other
kids
after
they
died
he
became
much
more
emotionally
withdrawn
from
stallman
perspective
the
emotional
withdrawal
was
merely
an
attempt
to
deal
with
the
agony
of
adolescence
labeling
his
teenage
years
a
pure
horror
stallman
says
he
often
felt
like
a
deaf
person
amid
a
crowd
of
chattering
music
listeners
i
often
had
the
feeling
that
i
could
understand
what
other
people
were
saying
says
stallman
recalling
the
emotional
bubble
that
insulated
him
from
the
rest
of
the
adolescent
and
adult
world
i
could
understand
the
words
but
something
was
going
on
underneath
the
conversations
that
i
did
understand
i
could
understand
why
people
were
interested
in
the
things
other
people
said
for
all
the
agony
it
produced
adolescence
would
have
a
encouraging
effect
on
stallman
sense
of
individuality
at
a
time
when
most
of
his
classmates
were
growing
their
hair
out
stallman
preferred
to
keep
his
short
at
a
time
when
the
whole
teenage
world
was
listening
to
rock
and
roll
stallman
preferred
classical
music
a
devoted
fan
of
science
fiction
mad
magazine
and
tv
stallman
cultivated
a
distinctly
personality
that
fed
off
the
incomprehension
of
parents
and
peers
alike
oh
the
puns
says
lippman
still
exasperated
by
the
memory
of
her
son
teenage
personality
there
a
thing
you
could
say
at
the
dinner
table
that
he
could
throw
back
at
you
as
a
pun
outside
the
home
stallman
saved
the
jokes
for
the
adults
who
tended
to
indulge
his
gifted
nature
one
of
the
first
was
a
counselor
who
handed
stallman
a
manual
for
the
ibm
computer
during
his
year
to
a
preteenager
fascinated
with
numbers
and
science
the
gift
was
a
an
atheist
would
probably
quibble
with
this
description
suffice
it
to
say
it
was
something
stallman
welcomed
see
previous
note
as
soon
as
i
heard
about
computers
i
wanted
to
see
one
and
play
with
one
by
the
end
of
summer
stallman
was
writing
out
paper
programs
according
to
the
internal
specifications
anxiously
anticipating
getting
a
chance
to
try
them
out
on
a
real
machine
with
the
first
personal
computer
still
a
decade
away
stallman
would
be
forced
to
wait
a
few
years
before
getting
access
to
his
first
computer
his
first
chance
finally
came
during
his
junior
year
of
high
school
hired
on
at
the
ibm
new
york
scientific
center
a
research
facility
in
downtown
manhattan
stallman
spent
the
summer
after
graduation
writing
his
first
program
a
for
the
written
in
the
programming
language
i
first
wrote
it
in
then
started
over
in
assembler
language
when
the
program
was
too
big
to
fit
in
the
computer
he
recalls
after
that
job
at
the
ibm
scientific
center
stallman
had
held
a
position
in
the
biology
department
at
rockefeller
university
although
he
was
already
moving
toward
a
career
in
math
or
physics
stallman
analytical
mind
impressed
the
lab
director
enough
that
a
few
years
after
stallman
departed
for
college
lippman
received
an
unexpected
phone
call
it
was
the
professor
at
rockefeller
lippman
says
he
wanted
to
know
how
richard
was
doing
he
was
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
working
in
computers
he
always
thought
richard
had
a
great
future
ahead
of
him
as
a
biologist
stallman
analytical
skills
impressed
faculty
members
at
columbia
as
well
even
when
stallman
himself
became
a
target
of
their
ire
typically
once
or
twice
an
hour
stallman
would
catch
some
mistake
in
the
lecture
says
breidbart
and
he
was
not
shy
about
letting
the
professors
know
it
immediately
it
got
him
a
lot
of
respect
but
not
much
popularity
hearing
breidbart
anecdote
retold
elicits
a
wry
smile
from
stallman
i
may
have
been
a
bit
of
a
jerk
sometimes
he
admits
but
i
found
kindred
spirits
among
the
teachers
because
they
too
liked
to
learn
kids
for
the
most
part
did
at
least
not
in
the
same
way
hanging
out
with
the
advanced
kids
on
saturday
nevertheless
encouraged
stallman
to
think
more
about
the
merits
of
increased
socialization
with
college
fast
approaching
stallman
like
many
in
his
columbia
science
honors
program
had
narrowed
his
list
of
desired
schools
down
to
two
choices
harvard
and
mit
hearing
of
her
son
desire
to
move
on
to
the
ivy
league
lippman
became
concerned
as
a
junior
stallman
was
still
having
with
teachers
and
administrators
only
the
year
before
he
had
pulled
straight
a
in
american
history
chemistry
french
and
algebra
but
a
glaring
f
in
english
reflected
the
ongoing
boycott
of
writing
assignments
such
miscues
might
draw
a
knowing
chuckle
at
mit
but
at
harvard
they
were
a
red
flag
during
her
son
junior
year
lippman
says
she
scheduled
an
appointment
with
a
therapist
the
therapist
expressed
instant
concern
over
unwillingness
to
write
papers
and
his
with
teachers
her
son
certainly
had
the
intellectual
wherewithal
to
succeed
at
harvard
but
did
he
have
the
patience
to
sit
through
college
classes
that
required
a
term
paper
the
therapist
suggested
a
trial
run
if
stallman
could
make
it
through
a
full
year
in
new
york
city
public
schools
including
an
english
class
that
required
term
papers
he
could
probably
make
it
at
harvard
following
the
completion
of
his
junior
year
stallman
promptly
enrolled
in
summer
school
at
louis
brandeis
high
school
a
public
school
located
on
street
and
began
making
up
the
mandatory
art
classes
he
had
shunned
earlier
in
his
career
by
fall
stallman
was
back
within
the
mainstream
population
of
new
york
city
students
it
was
easy
sitting
through
classes
that
seemed
remedial
in
comparison
with
his
saturday
studies
at
columbia
but
lippman
recalls
proudly
her
son
ability
to
toe
the
line
he
was
forced
to
kowtow
to
a
certain
degree
but
he
did
it
lippman
says
i
only
got
called
in
once
which
was
a
bit
of
a
miracle
it
was
the
calculus
teacher
complaining
that
richard
was
interrupting
his
lesson
i
asked
how
he
was
interrupting
he
said
richard
was
always
accusing
the
teacher
of
using
a
false
proof
i
said
is
he
right
the
teacher
said
but
i
ca
tell
that
to
the
class
they
would
understand
by
the
end
of
his
first
semester
at
brandeis
things
were
falling
into
place
a
in
english
wiped
away
much
of
the
stigma
of
the
earned
years
before
for
good
measure
stallman
backed
it
up
with
top
marks
in
american
history
advanced
placement
calculus
and
microbiology
the
crowning
touch
was
a
perfect
in
physics
though
still
a
social
outcast

he
was
forced
to
kowtow
to

says
his
mother
but
he
did
it
outside
the

stallman
pursued
his
studies
with
even
more
diligence
rushing
off
to
fulfill
his
duties
at
rockefeller
university
during
the
week
and
dodging
the
vietnam
protesters
on
his
way
to
saturday
school
at
columbia
it
was
there
while
the
rest
of
the
science
honors
program
students
sat
around
discussing
their
college
choices
that
stallman
finally
took
a
moment
to
participate
in
the
preclass
bull
session
recalls
breidbart
most
of
the
students
were
going
to
harvard
and
mit
of
course
but
you
had
a
few
going
to
other
ivy
league
schools
as
the
conversation
circled
the
room
it
became
apparent
that
richard
had
said
anything
yet
i
do
know
who
it
was
but
somebody
got
up
the
courage
to
ask
him
what
he
planned
to
do
thirty
years
later
breidbart
remembers
the
moment
clearly
as
soon
as
stallman
broke
the
news
that
he
too
would
be
attending
harvard
university
in
the
fall
an
awkward
silence
filled
the
room
almost
as
if
on
cue
the
corners
of
stallman
mouth
slowly
turned
upward
into
a
smile
says
breidbart
it
was
his
silent
way
of
saying
right
you
have
got
rid
of
me
yet
impeach
god
although
their
relationship
was
fraught
with
tension
richard
stallman
would
inherit
one
noteworthy
trait
from
his
mother
a
passion
for
progressive
politics
it
was
an
inherited
trait
that
would
take
several
decades
to
emerge
however
for
the
first
few
years
of
his
life
stallman
lived
in
what
he
now
admits
was
a
political
vacuum
see
michael
gross
richard
stallman
high
school
misfit
symbol
of
free
software
genius
like
most
americans
during
the
eisenhower
age
the
stallman
family
spent
the
trying
to
recapture
the
normalcy
lost
during
the
wartime
years
of
the
richard
father
and
i
were
democrats
but
happy
enough
to
leave
it
at
that
says
lippman
recalling
the
family
years
in
queens
we
did
get
involved
much
in
local
or
national
politics
that
all
began
to
change
however
in
the
late
when
alice
divorced
daniel
stallman
the
move
back
to
manhattan
represented
more
than
a
change
of
address
it
represented
a
new
independent
identity
and
a
jarring
loss
of
tranquility
i
think
my
first
taste
of
political
activism
came
when
i
went
to
the
queens
public
library
and
discovered
there
was
only
a
single
book
on
divorce
in
the
whole
library
recalls
lippman
it
was
very
controlled
by
the
catholic
church
at
least
in
elmhurst
where
we
lived
i
think
that
was
the
first
inkling
i
had
of
the
forces
that
quietly
control
our
lives
returning
to
her
childhood
neighborhood
upper
west
side
lippman
was
shocked
by
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
her
departure
to
hunter
college
a
decade
and
a
half
before
the
skyrocketing
demand
for
postwar
housing
had
turned
the
neighborhood
into
a
political
battleground
on
one
side
stood
the
politicians
and
businessmen
hoping
to
rebuild
many
of
the
neighborhood
blocks
to
accommodate
the
growing
number
of
workers
moving
into
the
city
on
the
other
side
stood
the
poor
irish
and
puerto
rican
tenants
who
had
found
an
affordable
haven
in
the
neighborhood
at
first
lippman
did
know
which
side
to
choose
as
a
new
resident
she
felt
the
need
for
new
housing
as
a
single
mother
with
minimal
income
however
she
shared
the
poorer
tenants
concern
over
the
growing
number
of
development
projects
catering
mainly
to
wealthy
residents
indignant
lippman
began
looking
for
ways
to
combat
the
political
machine
that
was
attempting
to
turn
her
neighborhood
into
a
clone
of
the
upper
east
side
lippman
says
her
first
visit
to
the
local
democratic
party
headquarters
came
in
looking
for
a
center
to
take
care
of
her
son
while
she
worked
she
had
been
appalled
by
the
conditions
encountered
at
one
of
the
centers
that
catered
to
residents
all
i
remember
is
the
stench
of
rotten
milk
the
dark
hallways
the
paucity
of
supplies
i
had
been
a
teacher
in
private
nursery
schools
the
contrast
was
so
great
we
took
one
look
at
that
room
and
left
that
stirred
me
up
the
visit
to
the
party
headquarters
proved
disappointing
however
describing
it
as
the
proverbial
room
lippman
says
she
became
aware
for
the
first
time
that
corruption
within
the
party
might
actually
be
the
reason
behind
the
thinly
disguised
hostility
toward
poor
residents
instead
of
going
back
to
the
headquarters
lippman
decided
to
join
up
with
one
of
the
many
clubs
aimed
at
reforming
the
democratic
party
and
ousting
the
last
vestiges
of
the
tammany
hall
machine
dubbed
the
woodrow
reform
democratic
club
lippman
and
her
club
began
showing
up
at
planning
and
meetings
demanding
a
greater
say
our
primary
goal
was
to
fight
tammany
hall
carmine
desapio
and
his
henchman
carmine
desapio
holds
the
dubious
distinction
of
being
the
first
boss
of
tammany
hall
the
new
york
city
political
machine
for
more
information
on
desapio
and
the
politics
of
new
york
see
john
davenport
skinning
the
tiger
carmine
desapio
and
the
end
of
the
tammany
era
new
york
affairs
says
lippman
i
was
the
representative
to
the
city
council
and
was
very
much
involved
in
creating
a
viable
plan
that
went
beyond
simply
adding
more
luxury
housing
to
the
neighborhood
such
involvement
would
blossom
into
greater
political
activity
during
the
by
lippman
had
become
an
outspoken
supporter
for
political
candidates
like
william
fitts
ryan
a
democratic
elected
to
congress
with
the
help
of
reform
clubs
and
one
of
the
first
representatives
to
speak
out
against
the
vietnam
war
it
was
long
before
lippman
too
was
an
outspoken
opponent
of
involvement
in
indochina
i
was
against
the
vietnam
war
from
the
time
kennedy
sent
troops
she
says
i
had
read
the
stories
by
reporters
and
journalists
sent
to
cover
the
early
stages
of
the
conflict
i
really
believed
their
forecast
that
it
would
become
a
quagmire
such
opposition
permeated
the
household
in
lippman
remarried
her
new
husband
maurice
lippman
a
major
in
the
air
national
guard
resigned
his
commission
to
demonstrate
his
opposition
to
the
war
lippman
stepson
andrew
lippman
was
at
mit
and
temporarily
eligible
for
a
student
deferment
still
the
threat
of
induction
should
that
deferment
disappear
as
it
eventually
did
made
the
risk
of
escalation
all
the
more
immediate
finally
there
was
richard
who
though
younger
faced
the
prospect
of
choosing
between
vietnam
or
canada
when
the
war
lasted
into
the
vietnam
was
a
major
issue
in
our
household
says
lippman
we
talked
about
it
constantly
what
would
we
do
if
the
war
continued
what
steps
richard
or
his
stepbrother
would
take
if
they
got
drafted
we
were
all
opposed
to
the
war
and
the
draft
we
really
thought
it
was
immoral
for
stallman
the
vietnam
war
elicited
a
complex
mixture
of
emotions
confusion
horror
and
ultimately
a
profound
sense
of
political
impotence
as
a
kid
who
could
barely
cope
in
the
mild
authoritarian
universe
of
private
school
stallman
experienced
a
shiver
whenever
the
thought
of
army
boot
camp
presented
itself
i
was
devastated
by
the
fear
but
i
could
imagine
what
to
do
and
did
have
the
guts
to
go
demonstrate
recalls
stallman
whose
march
birthday
earned
him
a
dreaded
low
number
in
the
draft
lottery
when
the
federal
government
finally
eliminated
college
deferments
in
i
could
envision
moving
to
canada
or
sweden
the
idea
of
getting
up
by
myself
and
moving
somewhere
how
could
i
do
that
i
did
know
how
to
live
by
myself
i
was
the
kind
of
person
who
felt
confident
in
approaching
things
like
that
stallman
says
he
was
both
impressed
and
shamed
by
the
family
members
who
did
speak
out
recalling
a
bumper
sticker
on
his
father
car
likening
the
my
lai
massacre
to
similar
nazi
atrocities
in
world
war
ii
he
says
he
was
excited
by
his
father
gesture
of
outrage
i
admired
him
for
doing
it
stallman
says
but
i
did
imagine
that
i
could
do
anything
i
was
afraid
that
the
juggernaut
of
the
draft
was
going
to
destroy
me
although
descriptions
of
his
own
unwillingness
to
speak
out
carry
a
tinge
of
nostalgic
regret
stallman
says
he
was
ultimately
turned
off
by
the
tone
and
direction
of
the
movement
like
other
members
of
the
science
honors
program
he
saw
the
weekend
demonstrations
at
columbia
as
little
more
than
a
distracting
another
columbia
science
honors
program
alum
describes
the
protests
as
background
noise
we
were
all
political
he
says
but
the
shp
was
imporant
we
would
never
have
skipped
it
for
a
demonstration
ultimately
stallman
says
the
irrational
forces
driving
the
movement
became
indistinguishable
from
the
irrational
forces
driving
the
rest
of
youth
culture
instead
of
worshiping
the
beatles
girls
in
stallman
age
group
were
suddenly
worshiping
firebrands
like
abbie
hoffman
and
jerry
rubin
to
a
kid
already
struggling
to
comprehend
his
teenage
peers
escapist
slogans
like
make
love
not
war
had
a
taunting
quality
not
only
was
it
a
reminder
that
stallman
the
outsider
who
hated
rock
roll
detested
drugs
and
did
participate
in
campus
demonstrations
was
getting
it
politically
he
was
getting
it
sexually
either
i
did
like
the
counter
culture
much
stallman
admits
i
did
like
the
music
i
did
like
the
drugs
i
was
scared
of
the
drugs
i
especially
like
the
and
i
did
like
the
prejudice
against
technology
after
all
i
loved
a
computer
and
i
did
like
the
mindless
that
i
often
encountered
there
were
people
whose
thinking
was
so
simplistic
that
if
they
disapproved
of
the
conduct
of
the
in
the
vietnam
war
they
had
to
support
the
north
vietnamese
they
could
imagine
a
more
complicated
position
i
guess
such
comments
alleviate
feelings
of
timidity
they
also
underline
a
trait
that
would
become
the
key
to
stallman
own
political
maturation
for
stallman
political
confidence
was
directly
proportionate
to
personal
confidence
by
stallman
had
become
confident
in
few
things
outside
the
realm
of
math
and
science
nevertheless
confidence
in
math
gave
him
enough
of
a
foundation
to
examine
the
movement
in
purely
logical
terms
in
the
process
of
doing
so
stallman
had
found
the
logic
wanting
although
opposed
to
the
war
in
vietnam
stallman
saw
no
reason
to
disavow
war
as
a
means
for
defending
liberty
or
correcting
injustice
rather
than
widen
the
breach
between
himself
and
his
peers
however
stallman
elected
to
keep
the
analysis
to
himself
in
stallman
left
behind
the
nightly
dinnertime
conversations
about
politics
and
the
vietnam
war
as
he
departed
for
harvard
looking
back
stallman
describes
the
transition
from
his
mother
manhattan
apartment
to
life
in
a
cambridge
dorm
as
an
escape
peers
who
watched
stallman
make
the
transition
however
saw
little
to
suggest
a
liberating
experience
he
seemed
pretty
miserable
for
the
first
while
at
harvard
recalls
dan
chess
a
classmate
in
the
science
honors
program
who
also
matriculated
at
harvard
you
could
tell
that
human
interaction
was
really
difficult
for
him
and
there
was
no
way
of
avoiding
it
at
harvard
harvard
was
an
intensely
social
kind
of
place
to
ease
the
transition
stallman
fell
back
on
his
strengths
math
and
science
like
most
members
of
the
science
honors
program
stallman
breezed
through
the
qualifying
exam
for
math
the
legendary
boot
camp
class
for
freshman
mathematics
concentrators
at
harvard
within
the
class
members
of
the
science
honors
program
formed
a
durable
unit
we
were
the
math
mafia
says
chess
with
a
laugh
harvard
was
nothing
at
least
compared
with
the
shp
to
earn
the
right
to
boast
however
stallman
chess
and
the
other
shp
alumni
had
to
get
through
math
promising
four
years
worth
of
math
in
two
semesters
the
course
favored
only
the
truly
devout
it
was
an
amazing
class
says
david
harbater
a
former
math
mafia
member
and
now
a
professor
of
mathematics
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
it
probably
safe
to
say
there
has
never
been
a
class
for
beginning
college
students
that
was
that
intense
and
that
advanced
the
phrase
i
say
to
people
just
to
get
it
across
is
that
among
other
things
by
the
second
semester
we
were
discussing
the
differential
geometry
of
banach
manifolds
that
usually
when
their
eyes
bug
out
because
most
people
do
start
talking
about
banach
manifolds
until
their
second
year
of
graduate
school
starting
with
students
the
class
quickly
melted
down
to
by
the
end
of
the
second
semester
of
that
says
harbater
only
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
of
that
would
go
on
to
become
future
mathematics
professors
would
go
on
to
teach
physics
the
other
one
emphasizes
harbater
was
richard
stallman
seth
breidbart
a
fellow
math
classmate
remembers
stallman
distinguishing
himself
from
his
peers
even
then
he
was
a
stickler
in
some
very
strange
ways
says
breidbart
there
is
a
standard
technique
in
math
which
everybody
does
wrong
it
an
abuse
of
notation
where
you
have
to
define
a
function
for
something
and
what
you
do
is
you
define
a
function
and
then
you
prove
that
it
well
defined
except
the
first
time
he
did
and
presented
it
he
defined
a
relation
and
proved
that
it
a
function
it
the
exact
same
proof
but
he
used
the
correct
terminology
which
no
one
else
did
just
the
way
he
was
it
was
in
math
that
richard
stallman
began
to
cultivate
a
reputation
for
brilliance
breidbart
agrees
but
chess
whose
competitive
streak
refused
to
yield
says
the
realization
that
stallman
might
be
the
best
mathematician
in
the
class
did
set
in
until
the
next
year
it
was
during
a
class
on
real
analysis
which
i
took
with
richard
the
next
year
says
chess
now
a
math
professor
at
hunter
college
i
actually
remember
in
a
proof
about
complex
valued
measures
that
richard
came
up
with
an
idea
that
was
basically
a
metaphor
from
the
calculus
of
variations
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
somebody
solve
a
problem
in
a
brilliantly
original
way
chess
makes
no
bones
about
it
watching
solution
unfold
on
the
chalkboard
was
a
devastating
blow
as
a
kid
who
always
taken
pride
in
being
the
smartest
mathematician
the
room
it
was
like
catching
a
glimpse
of
his
own
mortality
years
later
as
chess
slowly
came
to
accept
the
professional
rank
of
a
mathematician
he
had
proof
to
look
back
on
as
a
taunting
early
indicator
that
the
thing
about
mathematics
says
chess
you
do
have
to
be
a
mathematician
to
recognize
mathematical
talent
i
could
tell
i
was
up
there
but
i
could
also
tell
i
was
at
the
first
rank
if
richard
had
chosen
to
be
a
mathematician
he
would
have
been
a
mathematician
for
stallman
success
in
the
classroom
was
balanced
by
the
same
lack
of
success
in
the
social
arena
even
as
other
members
of
the
math
mafia
gathered
to
take
on
the
math
problem
sets
stallman
preferred
to
work
alone
the
same
went
for
living
arrangements
on
the
housing
application
for
harvard
stallman
clearly
spelled
out
his
preferences
i
said
i
preferred
an
invisible
inaudible
intangible
roommate
he
says
in
a
rare
stroke
of
bureaucratic
foresight
harvard
housing
office
accepted
the
request
giving
stallman
a
single
for
his
freshman
year
breidbart
the
only
member
to
share
a
dorm
with
stallman
that
freshman
year
says
stallman
slowly
but
surely
learned
how
to
interact
with
other
students
he
recalls
how
other
dorm
mates
impressed
by
stallman
logical
acumen
began
welcoming
his
input
whenever
an
intellectual
debate
broke
out
in
the
dining
club
or
dorm
commons
we
had
the
usual
bull
sessions
about
solving
the
world
problems
or
what
would
be
the
result
of
something
recalls
breidbart
say
somebody
discovers
an
immortality
serum
what
do
you
do
what
are
the
political
results
if
you
give
it
to
everybody
the
world
gets
overcrowded
and
everybody
dies
if
you
limit
it
if
you
say
everyone
who
alive
now
can
have
it
but
their
children
ca
then
you
end
up
with
an
underclass
of
people
without
it
richard
was
just
better
able
than
most
to
see
the
unforeseen
circumstances
of
any
decision
stallman
remembers
the
discussions
vividly
i
was
always
in
favor
of
immortality
he
says
i
was
shocked
that
most
people
regarded
immortality
as
a
bad
thing
how
else
would
we
be
able
to
see
what
the
world
is
like
years
from
now
although
a
mathematician
and
debater
stallman
shied
away
from
competitive
events
that
might
have
sealed
his
brilliant
reputation
near
the
end
of
freshman
year
at
harvard
breidbart
recalls
how
stallman
conspicuously
ducked
the
putnam
exam
a
prestigious
test
open
to
math
students
throughout
the
and
canada
in
addition
to
giving
students
a
chance
to
measure
their
knowledge
in
relation
to
their
peers
the
putnam
served
as
a
chief
recruiting
tool
for
academic
math
departments
according
to
campus
legend
the
top
scorer
automatically
qualified
for
a
graduate
fellowship
at
any
school
of
his
choice
including
harvard
like
math
the
putnam
was
a
brutal
test
of
merit
a
exam
in
two
parts
it
seemed
explicitly
designed
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
breidbart
a
veteran
of
both
the
science
honors
program
and
math
describes
it
as
easily
the
most
difficult
test
he
ever
took
just
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
difficult
it
was
says
breidbart
the
top
score
was
a
and
my
score
the
first
year
was
in
the
that
score
was
still
good
enough
to
place
me
in
the
country
surprised
that
stallman
the
best
student
in
the
class
had
passed
on
the
test
breidbart
says
he
and
a
fellow
classmate
cornered
him
in
the
dining
common
and
demanded
an
explanation
he
said
he
was
afraid
of
not
doing
well
breidbart
recalls
breidbart
and
the
friend
quickly
wrote
down
a
few
problems
from
memory
and
gave
them
to
stallman
he
solved
all
of
them
breidbart
says
leading
me
to
conclude
that
by
not
doing
well
he
either
meant
coming
in
second
or
getting
something
wrong
stallman
remembers
the
episode
a
bit
differently
i
remember
that
they
did
bring
me
the
questions
and
possible
that
i
solved
one
of
them
but
i
pretty
sure
i
did
solve
them
all
he
says
nevertheless
stallman
agrees
with
breidbart
recollection
that
fear
was
the
primary
reason
for
not
taking
the
test
despite
a
demonstrated
willingness
to
point
out
the
intellectual
weaknesses
of
his
peers
and
professors
in
the
classroom
stallman
hated
the
notion
of
competition
it
the
same
reason
i
never
liked
chess
says
stallman
whenever
i
play
i
would
become
so
consumed
by
the
fear
of
making
a
single
mistake
that
i
would
start
making
stupid
mistakes
very
early
in
the
game
the
fear
became
a
prophecy
whether
such
fears
ultimately
prompted
stallman
to
shy
away
from
a
mathematical
career
is
a
moot
issue
by
the
end
of
his
freshman
year
at
harvard
stallman
had
other
interests
pulling
him
away
from
the
field
computer
programming
a
latent
fascination
throughout
years
was
becoming
a
passion
where
other
math
students
sought
occasional
refuge
in
art
and
history
classes
stallman
sought
it
in
the
laboratory
for
stallman
the
first
taste
of
real
computer
programming
at
the
ibm
new
york
scientific
center
had
triggered
a
desire
to
learn
more
toward
the
end
of
my
first
year
at
harvard
school
i
started
to
have
enough
courage
to
go
visit
computer
labs
and
see
what
they
had
i
ask
them
if
they
had
extra
copies
of
any
manuals
that
i
could
read
taking
the
manuals
home
stallman
would
examine
machine
specifications
compare
them
with
other
machines
he
already
knew
and
concoct
a
trial
program
which
he
would
then
bring
back
to
the
lab
along
with
the
borrowed
manual
although
some
labs
balked
at
the
notion
of
a
strange
kid
coming
off
the
street
and
working
on
the
lab
machinery
most
recognized
competence
when
they
saw
it
and
let
stallman
run
the
programs
he
had
created
one
day
near
the
end
of
freshman
year
stallman
heard
about
a
special
laboratory
near
mit
the
laboratory
was
located
on
the
ninth
floor
an
building
in
tech
square
the
newly
built
facility
dedicated
to
advanced
research
according
to
the
rumors
the
lab
itself
was
dedicated
to
the
science
of
artificial
intelligence
and
boasted
the
machines
and
software
programs
to
match
intrigued
stallman
decided
to
pay
a
visit
the
trip
was
short
about
miles
on
foot
minutes
by
train
but
as
stallman
would
soon
find
out
mit
and
harvard
can
feel
like
opposite
poles
of
the
same
planet
with
its
tangle
of
interconnected
office
buildings
the
institute
campus
offered
an
aesthetic
yin
to
harvard
spacious
yang
the
same
could
be
said
for
the
student
body
a
geeky
collection
of
school
misfits
known
more
for
its
predilection
for
pranks
than
its
politically
powerful
alumni
the
relationship
extended
to
the
ai
lab
as
well
unlike
harvard
computer
labs
there
was
no
gatekeeper
no
clipboard
waiting
list
for
terminal
access
no
explicit
atmosphere
of
look
but
do
touch
instead
stallman
found
only
a
collection
of
open
terminals
and
robotic
arms
presumably
the
artifacts
of
some
experiment
although
the
rumors
said
anybody
could
sit
down
at
the
terminals
stallman
decided
to
stick
with
the
original
plan
when
he
encountered
a
lab
employee
he
asked
if
the
lab
had
any
spare
manuals
it
could
loan
to
an
inquisitive
student
they
had
some
but
a
lot
of
things
were
documented
stallman
recalls
they
were
hackers
after
all
stallman
left
with
something
even
better
than
a
manual
a
job
although
he
does
remember
what
the
first
project
was
he
does
remember
coming
back
to
the
ai
lab
the
next
week
grabbing
an
open
terminal
and
writing
software
code
looking
back
stallman
sees
nothing
unusual
in
the
ai
lab
willingness
to
accept
an
unproven
outsider
at
first
glance
that
the
way
it
was
back
then
he
says
that
the
way
it
still
is
now
i
hire
somebody
when
i
meet
him
if
i
see
he
good
why
wait
stuffy
people
who
insist
on
putting
bureaucracy
into
everything
really
miss
the
point
if
a
person
is
good
he
should
have
to
go
through
a
long
detailed
hiring
process
he
should
be
sitting
at
a
computer
writing
code
to
get
a
taste
of
bureaucratic
and
stuffy
stallman
need
only
visit
the
computer
labs
at
harvard
there
access
to
the
terminals
was
doled
out
according
to
academic
rank
as
an
undergrad
stallman
usually
had
to
sign
up
or
wait
until
midnight
about
the
time
most
professors
and
grad
students
finished
their
daily
work
assignments
the
waiting
was
difficult
but
it
was
frustrating
waiting
for
a
public
terminal
knowing
all
the
while
that
a
half
dozen
equally
usable
machines
were
sitting
idle
inside
professors
locked
offices
seemed
the
height
of
illogic
although
stallman
paid
the
occasional
visit
to
the
harvard
computer
labs
he
preferred
the
more
egalitarian
policies
of
the
ai
lab
it
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
he
says
at
the
ai
lab
people
seemed
more
concerned
about
work
than
status
stallman
quickly
learned
that
the
ai
lab
policy
owed
much
to
the
efforts
of
a
vigilant
few
many
were
holdovers
from
the
days
of
project
mac
the
department
of
research
program
that
had
given
birth
to
the
first
operating
systems
a
few
were
already
legends
in
the
computing
world
there
was
richard
greenblatt
the
lab
lisp
expert
and
author
of
machack
the
computer
chess
program
that
had
once
humbled
critic
hubert
dreyfus
there
was
gerald
sussman
original
author
of
the
robotic
program
hacker
and
there
was
bill
gosper
the
math
whiz
already
in
the
midst
of
an
hacking
bender
triggered
by
the
philosophical
implications
of
the
computer
game
steven
levy
hackers
penguin

paperback
levy
devotes
about
five
pages
to
describing
gosper
fascination
with
life
a
software
game
first
created
by
british
mathematician
john
conway
i
heartily
recommend
this
book
as
a
supplement
perhaps
even
a
prerequisite
to
this
one
members
of
the
group
called
themselves
hackers
over
time
they
extended
the
hacker
description
to
stallman
as
well
in
the
process
of
doing
so
they
inculcated
stallman
in
the
ethical
traditions
of
the
hacker
ethic
to
be
a
hacker
meant
more
than
just
writing
programs
stallman
learned
it
meant
writing
the
best
possible
programs
it
meant
sitting
at
a
terminal
for
hours
straight
if
what
it
took
to
write
the
best
possible
programs
most
importantly
it
meant
having
access
to
the
best
possible
machines
and
the
most
useful
information
at
all
times
hackers
spoke
openly
about
changing
the
world
through
software
and
stallman
learned
the
instinctual
hacker
disdain
for
any
obstacle
that
prevented
a
hacker
from
fulfilling
this
noble
cause
chief
among
these
obstacles
were
poor
software
academic
bureaucracy
and
selfish
behavior
stallman
also
learned
the
lore
stories
of
how
hackers
when
presented
with
an
obstacle
had
circumvented
it
in
creative
ways
stallman
learned
about
lock
hacking
the
art
of
breaking
into
professors
offices
to
liberate
sequestered
terminals
unlike
their
pampered
harvard
counterparts
mit
faculty
members
knew
better
than
to
treat
the
ai
lab
terminal
as
private
property
if
a
faculty
member
made
the
mistake
of
locking
away
a
terminal
for
the
night
hackers
were
quick
to
correct
the
error
hackers
were
equally
quick
to
send
a
message
if
the
mistake
repeated
itself
i
was
actually
shown
a
cart
with
a
heavy
cylinder
of
metal
on
it
that
had
been
used
to
break
down
the
door
of
one
professor
office
gerald
sussman
an
mit
faculty
member
and
hacker
whose
work
at
the
ai
lab
predates
stallman
disputes
this
memory
according
to
sussman
the
hackers
never
broke
any
doors
to
retrieve
terminals
stallman
says
such
methods
while
lacking
in
subtlety
served
a
purpose
although
professors
and
administrators
outnumbered
hackers
inside
the
ai
lab
the
hacker
ethic
prevailed
indeed
by
the
time
of
stallman
arrival
at
the
ai
lab
hackers
and
the
ai
lab
administration
had
coevolved
into
something
of
a
symbiotic
relationship
in
exchange
for
fixing
the
machines
and
keeping
the
software
up
and
running
hackers
earned
the
right
to
work
on
favorite
pet
projects
often
the
pet
projects
revolved
around
improving
the
machines
and
software
programs
even
further
like
teenage
most
hackers
viewed
tinkering
with
machines
as
its
own
form
of
entertainment
nowhere
was
this
tinkering
impulse
better
reflected
than
in
the
operating
system
that
powered
the
central
dubbed
its
short
for
the
incompatible
time
sharing
system
the
operating
system
incorporated
the
hacking
ethic
into
its
very
design
hackers
had
built
it
as
a
protest
to
project
original
operating
system
the
compatible
time
sharing
system
ctss
and
named
it
accordingly
at
the
time
hackers
felt
the
ctss
design
too
restrictive
limiting
programmers
power
to
modify
and
improve
the
own
internal
architecture
if
needed
according
to
one
legend
passed
down
by
hackers
the
decision
to
build
its
had
political
overtones
as
well
unlike
ctss
which
had
been
designed
for
the
ibm
its
was
built
specifically
for
the
in
letting
hackers
write
the
systems
themselves
ai
lab
administrators
guaranteed
that
only
hackers
would
feel
comfortable
using
the
in
the
feudal
world
of
academic
research
the
gambit
worked
although
the
was
in
conjunction
with
other
departments
researchers
soon
had
it
to
themselves
its
boasted
features
most
commercial
operating
systems
would
offer
for
years
features
such
as
multitasking
debugging
and
editing
capability
using
it
and
the
as
a
foundation
the
lab
had
been
able
to
declare
independence
from
project
mac
shortly
before
stallman
apologize
for
the
whirlwind
summary
of
its
genesis
an
operating
system
many
hackers
still
regard
as
the
epitome
of
the
hacker
ethos
for
more
information
on
the
program
political
significance
see
simson
garfinkel
architects
of
the
information
society
years
of
the
laboratory
for
computer
science
at
mit
mit
press
as
an
apprentice
hacker
stallman
quickly
became
enamored
with
its
although
forbidding
to
most
newcomers
the
program
contained
many
features
that
provided
a
lesson
in
software
development
to
hacker
apprentices
such
as
himself
its
had
a
very
elegant
internal
mechanism
for
one
program
to
examine
another
says
stallman
recalling
the
program
you
could
examine
all
sorts
of
status
about
another
program
in
a
very
clean
way
using
this
feature
stallman
was
able
to
watch
how
programs
written
by
hackers
processed
instructions
as
they
ran
another
favorite
feature
would
allow
the
monitoring
program
to
freeze
the
monitored
job
between
instructions
in
other
operating
systems
such
a
command
would
have
resulted
in
gibberish
or
an
automatic
systems
crash
in
its
it
provided
yet
another
way
to
monitor
the
performance
if
you
said
the
job
it
would
always
be
stopped
in
user
mode
it
would
be
stopped
between
two
instructions
and
everything
about
the
job
would
be
consistent
for
that
point
stallman
says
if
you
said
the
job
it
would
continue
properly
not
only
that
but
if
you
were
to
change
the
status
of
the
job
and
then
change
it
back
everything
would
be
consistent
there
was
no
hidden
status
anywhere
by
the
end
of
hacking
at
the
ai
lab
had
become
a
regular
part
of
stallman
weekly
schedule
from
monday
to
thursday
stallman
devoted
his
waking
hours
to
his
harvard
classes
as
soon
as
friday
afternoon
arrived
however
he
was
on
the
t
heading
down
to
mit
for
the
weekend
stallman
usually
timed
his
arrival
to
coincide
with
the
ritual
food
run
joining
five
or
six
other
hackers
in
their
nightly
quest
for
chinese
food
he
would
jump
inside
a
car
and
head
across
the
harvard
bridge
into
nearby
boston
for
the
next
two
hours
he
and
his
hacker
colleagues
would
discuss
everything
from
its
to
the
internal
logic
of
the
chinese
language
and
pictograph
system
following
dinner
the
group
would
return
to
mit
and
hack
code
until
dawn
for
the
geeky
outcast
who
rarely
associated
with
his
peers
it
was
a
heady
experience
suddenly
hanging
out
with
people
who
shared
the
same
predilection
for
computers
science
fiction
and
chinese
food
i
remember
many
sunrises
seen
from
a
car
coming
back
from
chinatown
stallman
would
recall
nostalgically
years
after
the
fact
in
a
speech
at
the
swedish
royal
technical
institute
it
was
actually
a
very
beautiful
thing
to
see
a
sunrise
such
a
calm
time
of
day
it
a
wonderful
time
of
day
to
get
ready
to
go
to
bed
it
so
nice
to
walk
home
with
the
light
just
brightening
and
the
birds
starting
to
chirp
you
can
get
a
real
feeling
of
gentle
satisfaction
of
tranquility
about
the
work
that
you
have
done
that
night

stallman

http
the
more
stallman
hung
out
with
the
hackers
the
more
he
adopted
the
hacker
worldview
already
committed
to
the
notion
of
personal
liberty
stallman
began
to
infuse
his
actions
with
a
sense
of
communal
responsibility
when
others
violated
the
communal
code
stallman
was
quick
to
speak
out
within
a
year
of
his
first
visit
stallman
was
the
one
breaking
into
locked
offices
trying
to
recover
the
sequestered
terminals
that
belonged
to
the
lab
community
as
a
whole
in
true
hacker
fashion
stallman
also
sought
to
make
his
own
personal
contribution
to
the
art
of
lock
hacking
one
of
the
most
artful
tricks
commonly
attributed
to
greenblatt
involved
bending
a
stiff
wire
into
a
cane
and
attaching
a
loop
of
tape
to
the
long
end
sliding
the
wire
under
the
door
a
hacker
could
twist
and
rotate
the
wire
so
that
the
long
end
touched
the
door
knob
provided
the
adhesive
on
the
tape
held
a
hacker
could
open
the
doorknob
with
a
few
sharp
twists
when
stallman
tried
the
trick
he
found
it
good
but
wanting
in
a
few
places
getting
the
tape
to
stick
was
always
easy
and
twisting
the
wire
in
a
way
that
turned
the
doorknob
was
similarly
difficult
stallman
remembered
that
the
hallway
ceiling
possessed
tiles
that
could
be
slid
away
some
hackers
in
fact
had
used
the
false
ceiling
as
a
way
to
get
around
locked
doors
an
approach
that
generally
covered
the
perpetrator
in
fiberglass
but
got
the
job
done
stallman
considered
an
alternative
approach
what
if
instead
of
slipping
a
wire
under
the
door
a
hacker
slid
away
one
of
the
panels
and
stood
over
the
door
jamb
stallman
took
it
upon
himself
to
try
it
out
instead
of
using
a
wire
stallman
draped
out
a
long
loop
of
magnetic
tape
fastening
a
loop
of
adhesive
tape
at
the
base
of
the
u
standing
over
the
door
jamb
he
dangled
the
tape
until
it
looped
under
the
doorknob
lifting
the
tape
until
the
adhesive
fastened
he
then
pulled
on
the
left
end
of
the
tape
twisting
the
doorknob
sure
enough
the
door
opened
stallman
had
added
a
new
twist
to
the
art
of
lock
hacking
sometimes
you
had
to
kick
the
door
after
you
turned
the
door
knob
says
stallman
recalling
the
lingering
bugginess
of
the
new
method
it
took
a
little
bit
of
balance
to
pull
it
off
such
activities
reflected
a
growing
willingness
on
stallman
part
to
speak
and
act
out
in
defense
of
political
beliefs
the
ai
lab
spirit
of
direct
action
had
proved
inspirational
enough
for
stallman
to
break
out
of
the
timid
impotence
of
his
teenage
years
breaking
into
an
office
to
free
a
terminal
was
the
same
as
taking
part
in
a
protest
march
but
it
was
effective
in
ways
that
most
protests
were
it
solved
the
problem
at
hand
by
the
time
of
his
last
years
at
harvard
stallman
was
beginning
to
apply
the
whimsical
and
irreverent
lessons
of
the
ai
lab
back
at
school
did
he
tell
you
about
the
snake
his
mother
asks
at
one
point
during
an
interview
he
and
his
dorm
mates
put
a
snake
up
for
student
election
apparently
it
got
a
considerable
number
of
votes
stallman
verifies
the
snake
candidacy
with
a
few
caveats
the
snake
was
a
candidate
for
election
within
currier
house
stallman
dorm
not
the
student
council
stallman
does
remember
the
snake
attracting
a
fairly
significant
number
of
votes
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
fact
that
both
the
snake
and
its
owner
both
shared
the
same
last
name
people
may
have
voted
for
it
because
they
thought
they
were
voting
for
the
owner
stallman
says
campaign
posters
said
that
the
snake
was
for
the
office
we
also
said
it
was
an
large
candidate
since
it
had
climbed
into
the
wall
through
the
ventilating
unit
a
few
weeks
before
and
nobody
knew
where
it
was
running
a
snake
for
dorm
council
was
just
one
of
several
pranks
in
a
later
election
stallman
and
his
dorm
mates
nominated
the
house
master
son
his
platform
was
mandatory
retirement
at
age
seven
stallman
recalls
such
pranks
paled
in
comparison
to
the
pranks
on
the
mit
campus
however
one
of
the
most
successful
pranks
was
a
cat
named
woodstock
which
actually
managed
to
outdraw
most
of
the
human
candidates
in
a
election
they
never
announced
how
many
votes
woodstock
got
and
they
treated
those
votes
as
spoiled
ballots
stallman
recalls
but
the
large
number
of
spoiled
ballots
in
that
election
suggested
that
woodstock
had
actually
won
a
couple
of
years
later
woodstock
was
suspiciously
run
over
by
a
car
nobody
knows
if
the
driver
was
working
for
the
mit
administration
stallman
says
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
candidacy
but
i
admired
it
in
an
email
shortly
after
this
book
went
into
its
final
edit
cycle
stallman
says
he
drew
political
inspiration
from
the
harvard
campus
as
well
in
my
first
year
of
harvard
in
a
chinese
history
class
i
read
the
story
of
the
first
revolt
against
the
chin
dynasty
he
says
the
story
is
not
reliable
history
but
it
was
very
moving
at
the
ai
lab
stallman
political
activities
had
a
tone
during
the
hackers
faced
the
constant
challenge
of
faculty
members
and
administrators
pulling
an
around
its
and
its
design
one
of
the
first
attempts
came
in
the
as
more
and
more
faculty
members
began
calling
for
a
file
security
system
to
protect
research
data
most
other
computer
labs
had
installed
such
systems
during
late
but
the
ai
lab
through
the
insistence
of
stallman
and
other
hackers
remained
a
zone
for
stallman
the
opposition
to
security
was
both
ethical
and
practical
on
the
ethical
side
stallman
pointed
out
that
the
entire
art
of
hacking
relied
on
intellectual
openness
and
trust
on
the
practical
side
he
pointed
to
the
internal
structure
of
its
being
built
to
foster
this
spirit
of
openness
and
any
attempt
to
reverse
that
design
required
a
major
overhaul
the
hackers
who
wrote
the
incompatible
timesharing
system
decided
that
file
protection
was
usually
used
by
a
system
manager
to
get
power
over
everyone
else
stallman
would
later
explain
they
did
want
anyone
to
be
able
to
get
power
over
them
that
way
so
they
did
implement
that
kind
of
a
feature
the
result
was
that
whenever
something
in
the
system
was
broken
you
could
always
fix
it
see
richard
stallman
through
such
vigilance
hackers
managed
to
keep
the
ai
lab
machines
over
at
the
nearby
mit
laboratory
for
computer
sciences
however
faculty
members
won
the
day
the
lcs
installed
its
first
system
in
once
again
stallman
took
it
upon
himself
to
correct
what
he
saw
as
ethical
laxity
gaining
access
to
the
software
code
that
controlled
the
password
system
stallman
implanted
a
software
command
that
sent
out
a
message
to
any
lcs
user
who
attempted
to
choose
a
unique
password
if
a
user
entered
starfish
for
example
the
message
came
back
something
like
i
see
you
chose
the
password
starfish
i
suggest
that
you
switch
to
the
password
carriage
return
it
much
easier
to
type
and
also
it
stands
up
to
the
principle
that
there
should
be
no

the
enter
or
return
button
entering
a
blank
string
instead
of
a
unique
their
accounts
accessible
to
the
world
at
large
as
scary
as
that
might
have
been
for
some
users
it
reinforced
the
hacker
notion
that
institute
computers
and
even
institute
computer
files
belonged
to
the
public
not
private
individuals
stallman
speaking
in
an
interview
for
the
book
hackers
proudly
noted
that
of
the
lcs
staff
accepted
this
argument
and
employed
the
steven
levy
hackers
penguin
usa
paperback
stallman
crusade
would
prove
ultimately
futile
by
the
early
even
the
ai
lab
machines
were
sporting
security
systems
even
so
it
represents
a
major
milestone
in
terms
of
personal
and
political
maturation
to
the
objective
observer
familiar
with
stallman
later
career
it
offers
a
convenient
inflection
point
between
the
timid
teenager
afraid
to
speak
out
even
on
issues
of
importance
and
the
adult
activist
who
would
soon
turn
needling
and
cajoling
into
a
occupation
in
voicing
his
opposition
to
computer
security
stallman
drew
on
many
of
the
forces
that
had
shaped
his
early
life
hunger
for
knowledge
distaste
for
authority
and
frustration
over
hidden
procedures
and
rules
that
rendered
some
people
clueless
outcasts
he
would
also
draw
on
the
ethical
concepts
that
would
shape
his
adult
life
communal
responsibility
trust
and
the
hacker
spirit
of
direct
action
expressed
in
terms
the
null
string
represents
the
version
of
the
richard
stallman
political
in
a
few
places
but
for
the
most
part
fully
mature
looking
back
stallman
hesitates
to
impart
too
much
significance
to
an
event
so
early
in
his
hacking
career
in
that
early
stage
there
were
a
lot
of
people
who
shared
my
feelings
he
says
the
large
number
of
people
who
adopted
the
null
string
as
their
password
was
a
sign
that
many
people
agreed
that
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
was
simply
inclined
to
be
an
activist
about
it
stallman
does
credit
the
ai
lab
for
awakening
that
activist
spirit
however
as
a
teenager
stallman
had
observed
political
events
with
little
idea
as
to
how
a
single
individual
could
do
or
say
anything
of
importance
as
a
young
adult
stallman
was
speaking
out
on
matters
in
which
he
felt
supremely
confident
matters
such
as
software
design
communal
responsibility
and
individual
freedom
i
joined
this
community
which
had
a
way
of
life
which
involved
respecting
each
other
freedom
he
says
it
take
me
long
to
figure
out
that
that
was
a
good
thing
it
took
me
longer
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
moral
issue
hacking
at
the
ai
lab
was
the
only
activity
helping
to
boost
stallman
esteem
during
the
middle
of
his
sophomore
year
at
harvard
stallman
had
joined
up
with
a
dance
troupe
that
specialized
in
folk
dances
what
began
as
a
simple
attempt
to
meet
women
and
expand
his
social
horizons
soon
expanded
into
yet
another
passion
alongside
hacking
dancing
in
front
of
audiences
dressed
in
the
native
garb
of
a
balkan
peasant
stallman
no
longer
felt
like
the
awkward
uncoordinated
whose
attempts
to
play
football
had
ended
in
frustration
he
felt
confident
agile
and
alive
for
a
brief
moment
he
even
felt
a
hint
of
emotional
connection
he
soon
found
being
in
front
of
an
audience
fun
and
it
was
long
thereafter
that
he
began
craving
the
performance
side
of
dancing
almost
as
much
as
the
social
side
although
the
dancing
and
hacking
did
little
to
improve
stallman
social
standing
they
helped
him
overcome
the
feelings
of
weirdness
that
had
clouded
his
life
instead
of
lamenting
his
weird
nature
stallman
found
ways
to
celebrate
it
in
while
attending
a
convention
he
came
across
a
woman
selling
buttons
excited
stallman
ordered
a
button
with
the
words
impeach
god
emblazoned
on
it
for
stallman
the
impeach
god
message
worked
on
many
levels
an
atheist
since
early
childhood
stallman
first
saw
it
as
an
attempt
to
set
a
second
front
in
the
ongoing
debate
on
religion
back
then
everybody
was
arguing
about
god
being
dead
or
alive
stallman
recalls
god
approached
the
subject
of
god
from
a
completely
different
viewpoint
if
god
was
so
powerful
as
to
create
the
world
and
yet
do
nothing
to
correct
the
problems
in
it
why
would
we
ever
want
to
worship
such
a
god
would
it
be
better
to
put
him
on
trial
at
the
same
time
impeach
god
was
a
satirical
take
on
america
and
the
american
political
system
the
watergate
scandal
of
the
affected
stallman
deeply
as
a
child
stallman
had
grown
up
mistrusting
authority
now
as
an
adult
his
mistrust
had
been
solidified
by
the
culture
of
the
ai
lab
hacker
community
to
the
hackers
watergate
was
merely
a
shakespearean
rendition
of
the
daily
power
struggles
that
made
life
such
a
hassle
for
those
without
privilege
it
was
an
outsized
parable
for
what
happened
when
people
traded
liberty
and
openness
for
security
and
convenience
buoyed
by
growing
confidence
stallman
wore
the
button
proudly
people
curious
enough
to
ask
him
about
it
received
the
same
spiel
my
name
is
jehovah
stallman
would
say
i
have
a
special
plan
to
save
the
universe
but
because
of
heavenly
security
reasons
i
ca
tell
you
what
that
plan
is
you
just
going
to
have
to
put
your
faith
in
me
because
i
see
the
picture
and
you
do
you
know
i
good
because
i
told
you
so
if
you
do
believe
me
i
throw
you
on
my
enemies
list
and
throw
you
in
a
pit
where
infernal
revenue
service
will
audit
your
taxes
for
eternity
those
who
interpreted
the
spiel
as
a
parody
of
the
watergate
hearings
only
got
half
the
message
for
stallman
the
other
half
of
the
message
was
something
only
his
fellow
hackers
seemed
to
be
hearing
one
hundred
years
after
lord
acton
warned
about
absolute
power
corrupting
absolutely
americans
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
first
part
of
truism
power
itself
corrupts
rather
than
point
out
the
numerous
examples
of
petty
corruption
stallman
felt
content
voicing
his
outrage
toward
an
entire
system
that
trusted
power
in
the
first
place
i
figured
why
stop
with
the
small
fry
says
stallman
recalling
the
button
and
its
message
if
we
went
after
nixon
why
not
going
after
big
the
way
i
see
it
any
being
that
has
power
and
abuses
it
deserves
to
have
that
power
taken
away
small
puddle
of
freedom
ask
anyone
who
spent
more
than
a
minute
in
richard
stallman
presence
and
you
get
the
same
recollection
forget
the
long
hair
forget
the
quirky
demeanor
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
the
gaze
one
look
into
stallman
green
eyes
and
you
know
you
in
the
presence
of
a
true
believer
to
call
the
stallman
gaze
intense
is
an
understatement
stallman
eyes
do
just
look
at
you
they
look
through
you
even
when
your
own
eyes
momentarily
shift
away
out
of
simple
primate
politeness
stallman
eyes
remain
sizzling
away
at
the
side
of
your
head
like
twin
photon
beams
maybe
that
why
most
writers
when
describing
stallman
tend
to
go
for
the
religious
angle
in
a
article
titled
the
saint
of
free
software
andrew
leonard
describes
stallman
green
eyes
as
radiating
the
power
of
an
old

these

into
the
promised
land
by
facilitating
the
development
of
the
final
part
of
the
os
puzzle
like
moses
too
stallman
is
both
respected
and
reviled
by
allies
within
the
movement
he
is
an
unforgiving
and
hence
for
many
inspiring
leader
of
a
critically
important
aspect
of
modern
culture
i
have
deep
respect
for
the
principle
and
commitment
of
this
extraordinary
individual
though
i
also
have
great
respect
for
those
who
are
courageous
enough
to
question
his
thinking
and
then
sustain
his
wrath
in
a
final
interview
with
stallman
i
asked
him
his
thoughts
about
the
religious
comparisons
some
people
do
compare
me
with
an
old
testament
prophent
and
the
reason
is
old
testament
prophets
said
certain
social
practices
were
wrong
they
would
compromise
on
moral
issues
they
could
be
bought
off
and
they
were
usually
treated
with
contempt
such
analogies
serve
a
purpose
but
they
ultimately
fall
short
that
because
they
fail
to
take
into
account
the
vulnerable
side
of
the
stallman
persona
watch
the
stallman
gaze
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
you
will
begin
to
notice
a
subtle
change
what
appears
at
first
to
be
an
attempt
to
intimidate
or
hypnotize
reveals
itself
upon
second
and
third
viewing
as
a
frustrated
attempt
to
build
and
maintain
contact
if
as
stallman
himself
has
suspected
from
time
to
time
his
personality
is
the
product
of
autism
or
asperger
syndrome
his
eyes
certainly
confirm
the
diagnosis
even
at
their
most
level
of
intensity
they
have
a
tendency
to
grow
cloudy
and
distant
like
the
eyes
of
a
wounded
animal
preparing
to
give
up
the
ghost
my
own
first
encounter
with
the
legendary
stallman
gaze
dates
back
to
the
march
linuxworld
convention
and
expo
in
san
jose
california
billed
as
a
coming
out
party
for
the
linux
software
community
the
convention
also
stands
out
as
the
event
that
reintroduced
stallman
to
the
technology
media
determined
to
push
for
his
proper
share
of
credit
stallman
used
the
event
to
instruct
spectators
and
reporters
alike
on
the
history
of
the
gnu
project
and
the
project
overt
political
objectives
as
a
reporter
sent
to
cover
the
event
i
received
my
own
stallman
tutorial
during
a
press
conference
announcing
the
release
of
gnome
a
free
software
graphic
user
interface
unwittingly
i
push
an
entire
bank
of
hot
buttons
when
i
throw
out
my
very
first
question
to
stallman
himself
do
you
think
maturity
will
affect
the
commercial
popularity
of
the
linux
operating
system
i
ask
that
you
please
stop
calling
the
operating
system
linux
stallman
responds
eyes
immediately
zeroing
in
on
mine
the
linux
kernel
is
just
a
small
part
of
the
operating
system
many
of
the
software
programs
that
make
up
the
operating
system
you
call
linux
were
not
developed
by
linus
torvalds
at
all
they
were
created
by
gnu
project
volunteers
putting
in
their
own
personal
time
so
that
users
might
have
a
free
operating
system
like
the
one
we
have
today
to
not
acknowledge
the
contribution
of
those
programmers
is
both
impolite
and
a
misrepresentation
of
history
that
why
i
ask
that
when
you
refer
to
the
operating
system
please
call
it
by
its
proper
name
taking
the
words
down
in
my
reporter
notebook
i
notice
an
eerie
silence
in
the
crowded
room
when
i
finally
look
up
i
find
stallman
unblinking
eyes
waiting
for
me
timidly
a
second
reporter
throws
out
a
question
making
sure
to
use
the
term
instead
of
linux
miguel
de
icaza
leader
of
the
gnome
project
fields
the
question
it
is
until
halfway
through
de
icaza
answer
however
that
eyes
finally
unlock
from
mine
as
soon
as
they
do
a
mild
shiver
rolls
down
my
back
when
stallman
starts
lecturing
another
reporter
over
a
perceived
error
in
diction
i
feel
a
guilty
tinge
of
relief
at
least
he
is
looking
at
me
i
tell
myself
for
stallman
such
moments
would
serve
their
purpose
by
the
end
of
the
first
linuxworld
show
most
reporters
know
better
than
to
use
the
term
linux
in
his
presence
and
is
running
a
story
comparing
stallman
to
a
revolutionary
erased
from
the
history
books
by
hackers
and
entrepreneurs
eager
to
downplay
the
gnu
overly
political
other
articles
follow
and
while
few
reporters
call
the
operating
system
in
print
most
are
quick
to
credit
stallman
for
launching
the
drive
to
build
a
free
software
operating
system
years
before
i
wo
meet
stallman
again
for
another
months
during
the
interim
stallman
will
revisit
silicon
valley
once
more
for
the
august
linuxworld
show
although
not
invited
to
speak
stallman
does
managed
to
deliver
the
event
best
line
accepting
the
linus
torvalds
award
for
community
award
named
after
linux
creator
linus
behalf
of
the
free
software
foundation
stallman
wisecracks
giving
the
linus
torvalds
award
to
the
free
software
foundation
is
a
bit
like
giving
the
han
solo
award
to
the
rebel
alliance
this
time
around
however
the
comments
fail
to
make
much
of
a
media
dent
midway
through
the
week
red
hat
a
prominent
vendor
goes
public
the
news
merely
confirms
what
many
reporters
such
as
myself
already
suspect
linux
has
become
a
wall
street
buzzword
much
like
and
before
it
with
the
stock
market
approaching
the
rollover
like
a
hyperbola
approaching
its
vertical
asymptote
all
talk
of
free
software
or
open
source
as
a
political
phenomenon
falls
by
the
wayside
maybe
that
why
when
linuxworld
follows
up
its
first
two
shows
with
a
third
linuxworld
show
in
august
stallman
is
conspicuously
absent
my
second
encounter
with
stallman
and
his
trademark
gaze
comes
shortly
after
that
third
linuxworld
show
hearing
that
stallman
is
going
to
be
in
silicon
valley
i
set
up
a
lunch
interview
in
palo
alto
california
the
meeting
place
seems
ironic
not
only
because
of
the
recent
but
also
because
of
the
overall
backdrop
outside
of
redmond
washington
few
cities
offer
a
more
direct
testament
to
the
economic
value
of
proprietary
software
curious
to
see
how
stallman
a
man
who
has
spent
the
better
part
of
his
life
railing
against
our
culture
predilection
toward
greed
and
selfishness
is
coping
in
a
city
where
even
bungalows
run
in
the
price
range
i
make
the
drive
down
from
oakland
i
follow
the
directions
stallman
has
given
me
until
i
reach
the
headquarters
of
a
nonprofit
virtual
artists
collective
located
in
a
house
in
the
northern
corner
of
the
city
the
headquarters
are
refreshingly
suddenly
the
idea
of
stallman
lurking
in
the
heart
of
silicon
valley
does
seem
so
strange
after
all
i
find
stallman
sitting
in
a
darkened
room
tapping
away
on
his
gray
laptop
computer
he
looks
up
as
soon
as
i
enter
the
room
giving
me
a
full
blast
of
his
gaze
when
he
offers
a
soothing
hello
i
offer
a
return
greeting
before
the
words
come
out
however
his
eyes
have
already
shifted
back
to
the
laptop
screen
i
just
finishing
an
article
on
the
spirit
of
hacking
stallman
says
fingers
still
tapping
take
a
look
i
take
a
look
the
room
is
dimly
lit
and
the
text
appears
as
letters
on
a
black
background
a
reversal
of
the
color
scheme
used
by
most
desktop
programs
so
it
takes
my
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust
when
they
do
i
find
myself
reading
stallman
account
of
a
recent
meal
at
a
korean
restaurant
before
the
meal
stallman
makes
an
interesting
discovery
the
person
setting
the
table
has
left
six
chopsticks
instead
of
the
usual
two
in
front
of
stallman
place
setting
where
most
restaurant
goers
would
have
ignored
the
redundant
pairs
stallman
takes
it
as
challenge
find
a
way
to
use
all
six
chopsticks
at
once
like
many
software
hacks
the
successful
solution
is
both
clever
and
silly
at
the
same
time
hence
stallman
decision
to
use
it
as
an
illustration
as
i
read
the
story
i
feel
stallman
watching
me
intently
i
look
over
to
notice
a
proud
but
half
smile
on
his
face
when
i
praise
the
essay
my
comment
barely
merits
a
raised
eyebrow
i
be
ready
to
go
in
a
moment
he
says
stallman
goes
back
to
tapping
away
at
his
laptop
the
laptop
is
gray
and
boxy
not
like
the
sleek
modern
laptops
that
seemed
to
be
a
programmer
favorite
at
the
recent
linuxworld
show
above
the
keyboard
rides
a
smaller
lighter
keyboard
a
testament
to
aging
hands
during
the
late
when
stallman
was
putting
in
and
work
weeks
writing
the
first
free
software
tools
and
programs
for
the
gnu
project
the
pain
in
stallman
hands
became
so
unbearable
that
he
had
to
hire
a
typist
today
stallman
relies
on
a
keyboard
whose
keys
require
less
pressure
than
a
typical
computer
keyboard
stallman
has
a
tendency
to
block
out
all
external
stimuli
while
working
watching
his
eyes
lock
onto
the
screen
and
his
fingers
dance
one
quickly
gets
the
sense
of
two
old
friends
locked
in
deep
conversation
the
session
ends
with
a
few
loud
keystrokes
and
the
slow
disassembly
of
the
laptop
ready
for
lunch
stallman
asks
we
walk
to
my
car
pleading
a
sore
ankle
stallman
limps
along
slowly
stallman
blames
the
injury
on
a
tendon
in
his
left
foot
the
injury
is
three
years
old
and
has
gotten
so
bad
that
stallman
a
huge
fan
of
folk
dancing
has
been
forced
to
give
up
all
dancing
activities
i
love
folk
dancing
inherently
stallman
laments
not
being
able
to
dance
has
been
a
tragedy
for
me
stallman
body
bears
witness
to
the
tragedy
lack
of
exercise
has
left
stallman
with
swollen
cheeks
and
a
pot
belly
that
was
much
less
visible
the
year
before
you
can
tell
the
weight
gain
has
been
dramatic
because
when
stallman
walks
he
arches
his
back
like
a
pregnant
woman
trying
to
accommodate
an
unfamiliar
load
the
walk
is
further
slowed
by
stallman
willingness
to
stop
and
smell
the
roses
literally
spotting
a
particularly
beautiful
blossom
he
tickles
the
innermost
petals
with
his
prodigious
nose
takes
a
deep
sniff
and
steps
back
with
a
contented
sigh
mmm
rhinophytophilia
at
the
time
i
thought
stallman
was
referring
to
the
flower
scientific
name
months
later
i
would
learn
that
rhinophytophilia
was
in
fact
a
humorous
reference
to
the
activity
stallman
sticking
his
nose
into
a
flower
and
enjoying
the
moment
for
another
humorous
stallman
flower
incident
visit
http
he
says
rubbing
his
back
the
drive
to
the
restaurant
takes
less
than
three
minutes
upon
recommendation
from
tim
ney
former
executive
director
of
the
free
software
foundation
i
have
let
stallman
choose
the
restaurant
while
some
reporters
zero
in
on
stallman
lifestyle
the
truth
is
stallman
is
a
committed
epicure
when
it
comes
to
food
one
of
the
fringe
benefits
of
being
a
traveling
missionary
for
the
free
software
cause
is
the
ability
to
sample
delicious
food
from
around
the
world
visit
almost
any
major
city
in
the
world
and
chances
are
richard
knows
the
best
restaurant
in
town
says
ney
richard
also
takes
great
pride
in
knowing
on
the
menu
and
ordering
for
the
entire
table
for
today
meal
stallman
has
chosen
a
dim
sum
restaurant
two
blocks
off
university
avenue
palo
alto
main
drag
the
choice
is
partially
inspired
by
stallman
recent
visit
to
china
including
a
lecture
stop
in
guangdong
province
in
addition
to
stallman
personal
aversion
to
spicier
hunanese
and
szechuan
cuisine
i
not
a
big
fan
of
spicy
stallman
admits
we
arrive
a
few
minutes
after
and
find
ourselves
already
subject
to
a
wait
given
the
hacker
aversion
to
lost
time
i
hold
my
breath
momentarily
fearing
an
outburst
stallman
contrary
to
expectations
takes
the
news
in
stride
it
too
bad
we
could
have
found
somebody
else
to
join
us
he
tells
me
it
always
more
fun
to
eat
with
a
group
of
people
during
the
wait
stallman
practices
a
few
dance
steps
his
moves
are
tentative
but
skilled
we
discuss
current
events
stallman
says
his
only
regret
about
not
attending
linuxworld
was
missing
out
on
a
press
conference
announcing
the
launch
of
the
gnome
foundation
backed
by
sun
microsystems
and
ibm
the
foundation
is
in
many
ways
a
vindication
for
stallman
who
has
long
championed
that
free
software
and
economics
need
not
be
mutually
exclusive
nevertheless
stallman
remains
dissatisfied
by
the
message
that
came
out
the
way
it
was
presented
the
companies
were
talking
about
linux
with
no
mention
of
the
gnu
project
at
all
stallman
says
such
disappointments
merely
contrast
the
warm
response
coming
from
overseas
especially
asia
stallman
notes
a
quick
glance
at
the
stallman
travel
itinerary
bespeaks
the
growing
popularity
of
the
free
software
message
between
recent
visits
to
india
china
and
brazil
stallman
has
spent
of
the
last
days
on
united
states
soil
his
travels
have
given
him
an
opportunity
to
see
how
the
free
software
concept
translates
into
different
languages
of
cultures
in
india
many
people
are
interested
in
free
software
because
they
see
it
as
a
way
to
build
their
computing
infrastructure
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
stallman
says
in
china
the
concept
has
been
much
slower
to
catch
on
comparing
free
software
to
free
speech
is
harder
to
do
when
you
do
have
any
free
speech
still
the
level
of
interest
in
free
software
during
my
last
visit
was
profound
the
conversation
shifts
to
napster
the
san
mateo
california
software
company
which
has
become
something
of
a
media
cause
cèlëbre
in
recent
months
the
company
markets
a
controversial
software
tool
that
lets
music
fans
browse
and
copy
the
music
files
of
other
music
fans
thanks
to
the
magnifying
powers
of
the
internet
this
program
has
evolved
into
a
de
facto
online
juke
box
giving
ordinary
music
fans
a
way
to
listen
to
music
files
over
the
computer
without
paying
a
royalty
or
fee
much
to
record
companies
chagrin
although
based
on
proprietary
software
the
napster
system
draws
inspiration
from
the
stallman
contention
that
once
a
work
enters
the
digital
other
words
once
making
a
copy
is
less
a
matter
of
duplicating
sounds
or
duplicating
atoms
and
more
a
matter
of
duplicating
natural
human
impulse
to
share
a
work
becomes
harder
to
restrict
rather
than
impose
additional
restrictions
napster
execs
have
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
impulse
giving
music
listeners
a
central
place
to
trade
music
files
the
company
has
gambled
on
its
ability
to
steer
the
resulting
user
traffic
toward
other
commercial
opportunities
the
sudden
success
of
the
napster
model
has
put
the
fear
in
traditional
record
companies
with
good
reason
just
days
before
my
palo
alto
meeting
with
stallman
district
court
judge
marilyn
patel
granted
a
request
filed
by
the
recording
industry
association
of
america
for
an
injunction
against
the
service
the
injunction
was
subsequently
suspended
by
the
ninth
district
court
of
appeals
but
by
early
the
court
of
appeals
too
would
find
the
san
company
in
breach
of
copyright
a
decision
riaa
spokesperson
hillary
rosen
would
later
proclaim
proclaim
a
clear
victory
for
the
creative
content
community
and
the
legitimate
online
marketplace
see
a
clear
victory
for
recording
industry
in
napster
case
riaa
press
release
february
http
for
hackers
such
as
stallman
the
napster
business
model
is
scary
in
different
ways
the
eagerness
to
appropriate
hacker
principles
such
as
file
sharing
and
communal
information
ownership
while
at
the
same
time
selling
a
service
based
on
proprietary
software
sends
a
distressing
mixed
message
as
a
person
who
already
has
a
hard
enough
time
getting
his
own
carefully
articulated
message
into
the
media
stream
stallman
is
understandably
reticent
when
it
comes
to
speaking
out
about
the
company
still
stallman
does
admit
to
learning
a
thing
or
two
from
the
social
side
of
the
napster
phenomenon
before
napster
i
thought
it
might
be
ok
for
people
to
privately
redistribute
works
of
entertainment
stallman
says
the
number
of
people
who
find
napster
useful
however
tells
me
that
the
right
to
redistribute
copies
not
only
on
a
basis
but
to
the
public
at
large
is
essential
and
therefore
may
not
be
taken
away
no
sooner
does
stallman
say
this
than
the
door
to
the
restaurant
swings
open
and
we
are
invited
back
inside
by
the
host
within
a
few
seconds
we
are
seated
in
a
side
corner
of
the
restaurant
next
to
a
large
mirrored
wall
the
restaurant
menu
doubles
as
an
order
form
and
stallman
is
quickly
checking
off
boxes
before
the
host
has
even
brought
water
to
the
table
shrimp
roll
wrapped
in
skin
stallman
reads
skin
it
offers
such
an
interesting
texture
i
think
we
should
get
it
this
comment
leads
to
an
impromptu
discussion
of
chinese
food
and
stallman
recent
visit
to
china
the
food
in
china
is
utterly
exquisite
stallman
says
his
voice
gaining
an
edge
of
emotion
for
the
first
time
this
morning
so
many
different
things
that
i
never
seen
in
the
local
things
made
from
local
mushrooms
and
local
vegetables
it
got
to
the
point
where
i
started
keeping
a
journal
just
to
keep
track
of
every
wonderful
meal
the
conversation
segues
into
a
discussion
of
korean
cuisine
during
the
same
june
asian
tour
stallman
paid
a
visit
to
south
korea
his
arrival
ignited
a
in
the
local
media
thanks
to
a
korean
software
conference
attended
by
microsoft
founder
and
chairman
bill
gates
that
same
week
next
to
getting
his
photo
above
gates
photo
on
the
front
page
of
the
top
seoul
newspaper
stallman
says
the
best
thing
about
the
trip
was
the
food
i
had
a
bowl
of
naeng
myun
which
is
cold
noodles
says
stallman
these
were
a
very
interesting
feeling
noodle
most
places
do
use
quite
the
same
kind
of
noodles
for
your
naeng
myun
so
i
can
say
with
complete
certainty
that
this
was
the
most
exquisite
naeng
myun
i
ever
had
the
term
exquisite
is
high
praise
coming
from
stallman
i
know
this
because
a
few
moments
after
listening
to
stallman
rhapsodize
about
naeng
myun
i
feel
his
eyes
singeing
the
top
of
my
right
shoulder
there
is
the
most
exquisite
woman
sitting
just
behind
you
stallman
says
i
turn
to
look
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
back
the
woman
is
young
somewhere
in
her
and
is
wearing
a
white
sequinned
dress
she
and
her
male
lunch
companion
are
in
the
final
stages
of
paying
the
check
when
both
get
up
from
the
table
to
leave
the
restaurant
i
can
tell
without
looking
because
stallman
eyes
suddenly
dim
in
intensity
oh
no
he
says
they
gone
and
to
think
probably
never
even
get
to
see
her
again
after
a
brief
sigh
stallman
recovers
the
moment
gives
me
a
chance
to
discuss
stallman
reputation
the
fairer
sex
the
reputation
is
a
bit
contradictory
at
times
a
number
of
hackers
report
predilection
for
greeting
females
with
a
kiss
on
the
back
of
the
mae
ling
mak
mae
ling
story
december
http
so
far
mak
is
the
only
person
i
found
willing
to
speak
on
the
record
in
regard
to
this
practice
although
i
heard
this
from
a
few
other
female
sources
mak
despite
expressing
initial
revulsion
at
it
later
managed
to
put
aside
her
misgivings
and
dance
with
stallman
at
a
linuxworld
show
http
a
may
article
meanwhile
portrays
stallman
as
a
bit
of
a
hacker
lothario
documenting
the
free
love
connection
reporter
annalee
newitz
presents
stallman
as
rejecting
traditional
family
values
telling
her
i
believe
in
love
but
not
monogamy
see
annalee
newitz
if
code
is
free
why
not
me
may
stallman
lets
his
menu
drop
a
little
when
i
bring
this
up
well
most
men
seem
to
want
sex
and
seem
to
have
a
rather
contemptuous
attitude
towards
women
he
says
even
women
they
involved
with
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
i
mention
a
passage
from
the
book
open
sources
in
which
stallman
confesses
to
wanting
to
name
the
gnu
kernel
after
a
girlfriend
at
the
time
the
girlfriend
name
was
alix
a
name
that
fit
perfectly
with
the
unix
developer
convention
of
putting
an
x
at
the
end
of
any
new
kernel
linux
because
the
woman
was
a
unix
system
administrator
stallman
says
it
would
have
been
an
even
more
touching
tribute
unfortunately
stallman
notes
the
kernel
project
eventual
main
developer
renamed
the
kernel
richard
stallman
the
gnu
operating
system
and
the
free
software
movement
open
sources
associates
although
stallman
and
the
girlfriend
later
broke
up
the
story
triggers
an
automatic
question
for
all
the
media
imagery
depicting
him
as
a
fanatic
is
richard
stallman
really
just
a
hopeless
romantic
a
wandering
quixote
tilting
at
corporate
windmills
in
an
effort
to
impress
some
dulcinea
i
was
really
trying
to
be
romantic
stallman
says
recalling
the
alix
story
it
was
more
of
a
teasing
thing
i
mean
it
was
romantic
but
it
was
also
teasing
you
know
it
would
have
been
a
delightful
surprise
for
the
first
time
all
morning
stallman
smiles
i
bring
up
the
hand
kissing
yes
i
do
do
that
stallman
says
i
found
it
a
way
of
offering
some
affection
that
a
lot
of
women
will
enjoy
it
a
chance
to
give
some
affection
and
to
be
appreciated
for
it
affection
is
a
thread
that
runs
clear
through
richard
stallman
life
and
he
is
painfully
candid
about
it
when
questions
arise
there
really
has
been
much
affection
in
my
life
except
in
my
mind
he
says
still
the
discussion
quickly
grows
awkward
after
a
few
replies
stallman
finally
lifts
up
his
menu
cutting
off
the
inquiry
would
you
like
some
shimai
he
asks
when
the
food
comes
out
the
conversation
slaloms
between
the
arriving
courses
we
discuss
the
hacker
affection
for
chinese
food
the
weekly
dinner
runs
into
boston
chinatown
district
during
days
as
a
staff
programmer
at
the
ai
lab
and
the
underlying
logic
of
the
chinese
language
and
its
associated
writing
system
each
thrust
on
my
part
elicits
a
parry
on
stallman
part
i
heard
some
people
speaking
shanghainese
the
last
time
i
was
in
china
stallman
says
it
was
interesting
to
hear
it
sounded
quite
different
from
mandarin
i
had
them
tell
me
some
cognate
words
in
mandarin
and
shanghainese
in
some
cases
you
can
see
the
resemblance
but
one
question
i
was
wondering
about
was
whether
tones
would
be
similar
they
not
interesting
to
me
because
there
a
theory
that
the
tones
evolved
from
additional
syllables
that
got
lost
and
replaced
their
effect
survives
in
the
tone
if
that
true
and
i
seen
claims
that
that
happened
within
historic
times
the
dialects
must
have
diverged
before
the
loss
of
these
final
syllables
the
first
dish
a
plate
of
turnip
cakes
has
arrived
both
stallman
and
i
take
a
moment
to
carve
up
the
large
rectangular
cakes
which
smell
like
boiled
cabbage
but
taste
like
potato
latkes
fried
in
bacon
i
decide
to
bring
up
the
outcast
issue
again
wondering
if
stallman
teenage
years
conditioned
him
to
take
unpopular
stands
most
notably
his
uphill
battle
since
to
get
computer
users
and
the
media
to
replace
the
popular
term
linux
with
i
believe
it
did
help
me
stallman
says
chewing
on
a
dumpling
i
have
never
understood
what
peer
pressure
does
to
other
people
i
think
the
reason
is
that
i
was
so
hopelessly
rejected
that
for
me
there
anything
to
gain
by
trying
to
follow
any
of
the
fads
it
would
have
made
any
difference
i
still
be
just
as
rejected
so
i
did
try
stallman
points
to
his
taste
in
music
as
a
key
example
of
his
contrarian
tendencies
as
a
teenager
when
most
of
his
high
school
classmates
were
listening
to
motown
and
acid
rock
stallman
preferred
classical
music
the
memory
leads
to
a
rare
humorous
episode
from
years
following
the
beatles
appearance
on
the
ed
sullivan
show
most
of
classmates
rushed
out
to
purchase
the
latest
beatles
albums
and
singles
right
then
and
there
stallman
says
he
made
a
decision
to
boycott
the
fab
four
i
liked
some
of
the
popular
music
stallman
says
but
i
did
like
the
beatles
i
especially
disliked
the
wild
way
people
reacted
to
them
it
was
like
who
was
going
to
have
a
beatles
assembly

most
when
his
beatles
boycott
failed
to
take
hold
stallman
looked
for
other
ways
to
point
out
the
of
his
peers
stallman
says
he
briefly
considered
putting
together
a
rock
band
himself
dedicated
to
satirizing
the
liverpool
group
i
wanted
to
call
it
tokyo
rose
and
the
japanese
beetles
given
his
current
love
for
international
folk
music
i
ask
stallman
if
he
had
a
similar
affinity
for
bob
dylan
and
the
other
folk
musicians
of
the
early
stallman
shakes
his
head
i
did
like
peter
paul
and
mary
he
says
that
reminds
me
of
a
great
filk
when
i
ask
for
a
definition
of
filk
stallman
explains
the
concept
a
filk
he
says
is
a
popular
song
whose
lyrics
have
been
replaced
with
parody
lyrics
the
process
of
writing
a
filk
is
called
filking
and
it
is
a
popular
activity
among
hackers
and
aficionados
classic
filks
include
on

a

of

stallman
asks
me
if
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
the
folk
filk
as
soon
as
i
say
yes
stallman
voice
begins
singing
in
an
unexpectedly
clear
tone
how
much
wood
could
a
woodchuck
chuck
if
a
woodchuck
could
chuck

how
many

lock
if
a
polak
could
lock
poles
how
many

could
a

if
a
negro
could
grow

the
answer
my
dear
is
stick
it
in
your
answer
is
to

the
singing
ends
and
stallman

curl
into

after
a

moments
of
hesitation
i
finally
smile
too
do
you
want
that
last
cornball
stallman
asks
eyes
twinkling
before
i
can
screw
up
the
punch
line
stallman
grabs
the
dumpling
with
his
two
chopsticks
and
lifts
it
proudly
maybe
i
the
one
who
should
get
the
cornball
he
says
the
food
gone
our
conversation
assumes
the
dynamics
of
a
normal
interview
stallman
reclines
in
his
chair
and
cradles
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hands
we
resume
talking
about
napster
and
its
relation
to
the
free
software
movement
should
the
principles
of
free
software
be
extended
to
similar
arenas
such
as
music
publishing
i
ask
it
a
mistake
to
transfer
answers
from
one
thing
to
another
says
stallman
contrasting
songs
with
software
programs
the
right
approach
is
to
look
at
each
type
of
work
and
see
what
conclusion
you
get
when
it
comes
to
copyrighted
works
stallman
says
he
divides
the
world
into
three
categories
the
first
category
involves
functional
software
programs
dictionaries
and
textbooks
the
second
category
involves
works
that
might
best
be
described
as
testimonial
scientific
papers
and
historical
documents
such
works
serve
a
purpose
that
would
be
undermined
if
subsequent
readers
or
authors
were
free
to
modify
the
work
at
will
the
final
category
involves
works
of
personal
diaries
journals
and
autobiographies
to
modify
such
documents
would
be
to
alter
a
person
recollections
or
point
of
stallman
considers
ethically
unjustifiable
of
the
three
categories
the
first
should
give
users
the
unlimited
right
to
make
modified
versions
while
the
second
and
third
should
regulate
that
right
according
to
the
will
of
the
original
author
regardless
of
category
however
the
freedom
to
copy
and
redistribute
noncommercially
should
remain
unabridged
at
all
times
stallman
insists
if
that
means
giving
internet
users
the
right
to
generate
a
hundred
copies
of
an
article
image
song
or
book
and
then
email
the
copies
to
a
hundred
strangers
so
be
it
it
clear
that
private
occasional
redistribution
must
be
permitted
because
only
a
police
state
can
stop
that
stallman
says
it
antisocial
to
come
between
people
and
their
friends
napster
has
convinced
me
that
we
also
need
to
permit
must
permit
even
noncommercial
redistribution
to
the
public
for
the
fun
of
it
because
so
many
people
want
to
do
that
and
find
it
so
useful
when
i
ask
whether
the
courts
would
accept
such
a
permissive
outlook
stallman
cuts
me
off
that
the
wrong
question
he
says
i
mean
now
you
changed
the
subject
entirely
from
one
of
ethics
to
one
of
interpreting
laws
and
those
are
two
totally
different
questions
in
the
same
field
it
useless
to
jump
from
one
to
the
other
how
the
courts
would
interpret
the
existing
laws
is
mainly
in
a
harsh
way
because
that
the
way
these
laws
have
been
bought
by
publishers
the
comment
provides
an
insight
into
political
philosophy
just
because
the
legal
system
currently
backs
up
businesses
ability
to
treat
copyright
as
the
software
equivalent
of
land
title
does
mean
computer
users
have
to
play
the
game
according
to
those
rules
freedom
is
an
ethical
issue
not
a
legal
issue
i
looking
beyond
what
the
existing
laws
are
to
what
they
should
be
stallman
says
i
not
trying
to
draft
legislation
thinking
about
what
should
the
law
do
i
consider
the
law
prohibiting
the
sharing
of
copies
with
your
friend
the
moral
equivalent
of
jim
crow
it
does
not
deserve
respect
the
invocation
of
jim
crow
prompts
another
question
how
much
influence
or
inspiration
does
stallman
draw
from
past
political
leaders
like
the
movement
of
the
and
his
attempt
to
drive
social
change
is
based
on
an
appeal
to
timeless
values
freedom
justice
and
fair
play
stallman
divides
his
attention
between
my
analogy
and
a
particularly
tangled
strand
of
hair
when
i
stretch
the
analogy
to
the
point
where
i
comparing
stallman
with
martin
luther
king
stallman
after
breaking
off
a
split
end
and
popping
it
into
his
mouth
cuts
me
off
i
not
in
his
league
but
i
do
play
the
same
game
he
says
chewing
i
suggest
malcolm
x
as
another
point
of
comparison
like
the
former
nation
of
islam
spokesperson
stallman
has
built
up
a
reputation
for
courting
controversy
alienating
potential
allies
and
preaching
a
message
favoring
over
cultural
integration
chewing
on
another
split
end
stallman
rejects
the
comparison
my
message
is
closer
to
king
message
he
says
it
a
universal
message
it
a
message
of
firm
condemnation
of
certain
practices
that
mistreat
others
it
not
a
message
of
hatred
for
anyone
and
it
not
aimed
at
a
narrow
group
of
people
i
invite
anyone
to
value
freedom
and
to
have
freedom
even
so
a
suspicious
attitude
toward
political
alliances
remains
a
fundamental
stallman
character
trait
in
the
case
of
his
distaste
for
the
term
open
source
the
unwillingness
to
participate
in
recent
projects
seems
understandable
as
a
man
who
has
spent
the
last
two
decades
stumping
on
the
behalf
of
free
software
stallman
political
capital
is
deeply
invested
in
the
term
still
comments
such
as
the
han
solo
wisecrack
at
the
linuxworld
have
only
reinforced
the
stallman
reputation
in
the
software
industry
as
a
disgrunted
mossback
unwilling
to
roll
with
political
or
marketing
trends
i
admire
and
respect
richard
for
all
the
work
done
says
red
hat
president
robert
young
summing
up
stallman
paradoxical
political
nature
my
only
critique
is
that
sometimes
richard
treats
his
friends
worse
than
his
enemies
stallman
unwillingness
to
seek
alliances
seems
equally
perplexing
when
you
consider
his
political
interests
outside
of
the
free
software
movement
visit
stallman
offices
at
mit
and
you
instantly
find
a
clearinghouse
of
news
articles
covering
abuses
around
the
globe
visit
his
web
site
and
you
find
diatribes
on
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
the
war
on
drugs
and
the
world
trade
organization
given
his
activist
tendencies
i
ask
why
stallman
sought
a
larger
voice
why
has
he
used
his
visibility
in
the
hacker
world
as
a
platform
to
boost
rather
than
reduce
his
political
voice
stallman
lets
his
tangled
hair
drop
and
contemplates
the
question
for
a
moment
i
hesitate
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
this
little
puddle
of
freedom
he
says
because
the
more
and
conventional
areas
of
working
for
freedom
and
a
better
society
are
tremendously
important
i
would
say
that
free
software
is
as
important
as
they
are
it
the
responsibility
i
undertook
because
it
dropped
in
my
lap
and
i
saw
a
way
i
could
do
something
about
it
but
for
example
to
end
police
brutality
to
end
the
war
on
drugs
to
end
the
kinds
of
racism
we
still
have
to
help
everyone
have
a
comfortable
life
to
protect
the
rights
of
people
who
do
abortions
to
protect
us
from
theocracy
these
are
tremendously
important
issues
far
more
important
than
what
i
do
i
just
wish
i
knew
how
to
do
something
about
them
once
again
stallman
presents
his
political
activity
as
a
function
of
personal
confidence
given
the
amount
of
time
it
has
taken
him
to
develop
and
hone
the
free
software
movement
core
tenets
stallman
is
hesitant
to
jump
aboard
any
issues
or
trends
that
might
transport
him
into
uncharted
territory
i
wish
i
knew
i
how
to
make
a
major
difference
on
those
bigger
issues
because
i
would
be
tremendously
proud
if
i
could
but
they
very
hard
and
lots
of
people
who
are
probably
better
than
i
am
have
been
working
on
them
and
have
gotten
only
so
far
he
says
but
as
i
see
it
while
other
people
were
defending
against
these
big
visible
threats
i
saw
another
threat
that
was
unguarded
and
so
i
went
to
defend
against
that
threat
it
may
not
be
as
big
a
threat
but
i
was
the
only
one
there
chewing
a
final
split
end
stallman
suggests
paying
the
check
before
the
waiter
can
take
it
away
however
stallman
pulls
out
a
dollar
bill
and
throws
it
on
the
pile
the
bill
looks
so
clearly
counterfeit
i
ca
help
but
pick
it
up
and
read
it
sure
enough
it
is
counterfeit
instead
of
bearing
the
image
of
a
george
washington
or
abe
lincoln
the
front
side
bears
the
image
of
a
cartoon
pig
instead
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
banner
above
the
pig
reads
united
swines
of
avarice
the
bill
is
for
zero
dollars
and
when
the
waiter
picks
up
the
money
stallman
makes
sure
to
tug
on
his
sleeve
i
added
an
extra
zero
to
your
tip
stallman
says
yet
another
half
smile
creeping
across
his
lips
the
waiter
uncomprehending
or
fooled
by
the
look
of
the
bill
smiles
and
scurries
away
i
think
that
means
we
free
to
go
stallman
says
the
emacs
commune
the
ai
lab
of
the
was
by
all
accounts
a
special
place
projects
and
researchers
gave
it
an
esteemed
position
in
the
world
of
computer
science
the
internal
hacker
culture
and
its
anarchic
policies
lent
a
rebellious
mystique
as
well
only
later
when
many
of
the
lab
scientists
and
software
superstars
had
departed
would
hackers
fully
realize
the
unique
and
ephemeral
world
they
had
once
inhabited
it
was
a
bit
like
the
garden
of
eden
says
stallman
summing
up
the
lab
and
its
ethos
in
a
forbes
article
it
had
occurred
to
us
not
to
cooperate

http
such
mythological
descriptions
while
extreme
underline
an
important
fact
the
ninth
floor
of
tech
square
was
more
than
a
workplace
for
many
for
hackers
such
as
stallman
it
was
home
the
word
home
is
a
weighted
term
in
the
stallman
lexicon
in
a
pointed
swipe
at
his
parents
stallman
to
this
day
refuses
to
acknowledge
any
home
before
currier
house
the
dorm
he
lived
in
during
his
days
at
harvard
he
has
also
been
known
to
describe
leaving
that
home
in
tragicomic
terms
once
while
describing
his
years
at
harvard
stallman
said
his
only
regret
was
getting
kicked
out
it
was
until
i
asked
stallman
what
precipitated
his
ouster
that
i
realized
i
had
walked
into
a
classic
stallman
setup
line
at
harvard
they
have
this
policy
where
if
you
pass
too
many
classes
they
ask
you
to
leave
stallman
says
with
no
dorm
and
no
desire
to
return
to
new
york
stallman
followed
a
path
blazed
by
greenblatt
gosper
sussman
and
the
many
other
hackers
before
him
enrolling
at
mit
as
a
grad
student
stallman
rented
an
apartment
in
nearby
cambridge
but
soon
viewed
the
ai
lab
itself
as
his
de
facto
home
in
a
speech
stallman
recalled
his
memories
of
the
ai
lab
during
this
period
i
may
have
done
a
little
bit
more
living
at
the
lab
than
most
people
because
every
year
or
two
for
some
reason
or
other
i
have
no
apartment
and
i
would
spend
a
few
months
living
at
the
lab
and
always
found
it
very
comfortable
as
well
as
nice
and
cool
in
the
summer
but
it
was
not
at
all
uncommon
to
find
people
falling
asleep
at
the
lab
again
because
of
their
enthusiasm
you
stay
up
as
long
as
you
possibly
can
hacking
because
you
just
do
want
to
stop
and
then
when
you
completely
exhausted
you
climb
over
to
the
nearest
soft
horizontal
surface
a
very
informal
stallman
the
lab
atmosphere
could
be
a
problem
at
times
what
some
saw
as
a
dorm
others
viewed
as
an
electronic

offered

withering
critique
of

computer

weizenbaum
term
for
the
hackers
who
populated
computer
rooms
such
as
the
ai

their
rumpled
clothes
their
unwashed
hair
and
unshaved
faces
and
their
uncombed
hair
all
testify
that
they
are
oblivious
to
their
bodies
and
to
the

which
they
move

freeman
almost
a
quarter
century
after
its

stallman
still
bristles
when
hearing
computer
bum
description
discussing
it
in
the
present
tense
as
if
weizenbaum
himself
was
still
in
the
room
he
wants
people
to
be
just
professionals
doing
it
for
the
money
and
wanting
to
get
away
from
it
and
forget
about
it
as
soon
as
possible
stallman
says
what
he
sees
as
a
normal
state
of
affairs
i
see
as
a
tragedy
hacker
life
however
was
not
without
tragedy
stallman
characterizes
his
transition
from
weekend
hacker
to
ai
lab
denizen
as
a
series
of
painful
misfortunes
that
could
only
be
eased
through
the
euphoria
of
hacking
as
stallman
himself
has
said
the
first
misfortune
was
his
graduation
from
harvard
eager
to
continue
his
studies
in
physics
stallman
enrolled
as
a
graduate
student
at
mit
the
choice
of
schools
was
a
natural
one
not
only
did
it
give
stallman
the
chance
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
great
mit
alumni
william
shockley
richard
feynman
and
murray
it
also
put
him
two
miles
closer
to
the
ai
lab
and
its
new
computer
my
attention
was
going
toward
programming
but
i
still
thought
well
maybe
i
can
do
both
stallman
says
toiling
in
the
fields
of
science
by
day
and
programming
in
the
monastic
confines
of
the
ai
lab
by
night
stallman
tried
to
achieve
a
perfect
balance
the
fulcrum
of
this
geek
was
his
weekly
outing
with
the
troupe
his
one
social
outlet
that
guaranteed
at
least
a
modicum
of
interaction
with
the
opposite
sex
near
the
end
of
that
first
year
at
mit
however
disaster
struck
a
knee
injury
forced
stallman
to
drop
out
of
the
troupe
at
first
stallman
viewed
the
injury
as
a
temporary
problem
devoting
the
spare
time
he
would
have
spent
dancing
to
working
at
the
ai
lab
even
more
by
the
end
of
the
summer
when
the
knee
still
ached
and
classes
reconvened
stallman
began
to
worry
my
knee
getting
any
better
stallman
recalls
which
meant
i
had
to
stop
dancing
completely
i
was
heartbroken
with
no
dorm
and
no
dancing
stallman
social
universe
imploded
like
an
astronaut
experiencing
the
aftereffects
of
stallman
found
that
his
ability
to
interact
with
nonhackers
especially
female
nonhackers
had
atrophied
significantly
after
weeks
in
the
ai
lab
the
self
confidence
he
been
quietly
accumulating
during
his
years
at
harvard
was
virtually
gone
i
felt
basically
that
i
lost
all
my
energy
stallman
recalls
i
lost
my
energy
to
do
anything
but
what
was
most
immediately
tempting
the
energy
to
do
something
else
was
gone
i
was
in
total
despair
stallman
retreated
from
the
world
even
further
focusing
entirely
on
his
work
at
the
ai
lab
by
october
he
dropped
out
of
mit
never
to
go
back
software
hacking
once
a
hobby
had
become
his
calling
looking
back
on
that
period
stallman
sees
the
transition
from
student
to
hacker
as
inevitable
sooner
or
later
he
believes
the
siren
call
of
computer
hacking
would
have
overpowered
his
interest
in
other
professional
pursuits
with
physics
and
math
i
could
never
figure
out
a
way
to
contribute
says
stallman
recalling
his
struggles
prior
to
the
knee
injury
i
would
have
been
proud
to
advance
either
one
of
those
fields
but
i
could
never
see
a
way
to
do
that
i
did
know
where
to
start
with
software
i
saw
right
away
how
to
write
things
that
would
run
and
be
useful
the
pleasure
of
that
knowledge
led
me
to
want
to
do
it
more
stallman
was
the
first
to
equate
hacking
with
pleasure
many
of
the
hackers
who
staffed
the
ai
lab
boasted
similar
incomplete
academic
rèsumès
most
had
come
in
pursuing
degrees
in
math
or
electrical
engineering
only
to
surrender
their
academic
careers
and
professional
ambitions
to
the
sheer
exhilaration
that
came
with
solving
problems
never
before
addressed
like
thomas
aquinas
the
scholastic
known
for
working
so
long
on
his
theological
summae
that
he
sometimes
achieved
spiritual
visions
hackers
reached
transcendent
internal
states
through
sheer
mental
focus
and
physical
exhaustion
although
stallman
shunned
drugs
like
most
hackers
he
enjoyed
the
high
that
came
near
the
end
of
a
coding
bender
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
emotion
however
was
the
sense
of
personal
fulfillment
when
it
came
to
hacking
stallman
was
a
natural
a
childhood
worth
of
study
sessions
gave
him
the
ability
to
work
long
hours
with
little
sleep
as
a
social
outcast
since
age
he
had
little
difficulty
working
alone
and
as
a
mathematician
with
gift
for
logic
and
foresight
stallman
possessed
the
ability
to
circumvent
design
barriers
that
left
most
hackers
spinning
their
wheels
he
was
special
recalls
gerald
sussman
an
mit
faculty
member
and
former
ai
lab
researcher
describing
stallman
as
a
clear
thinker
and
a
clear
designer
sussman
employed
stallman
as
a
assistant
beginning
in
the
project
was
complex
involving
the
creation
of
an
ai
program
that
could
analyze
circuit
diagrams
not
only
did
it
involve
an
expert
command
of
lisp
a
programming
language
built
specifically
for
ai
applications
but
it
also
required
an
understanding
of
how
a
human
might
approach
the
same
task
when
he
was
working
on
official
projects
such
as
sussman
automated
program
stallman
devoted
his
time
to
pet
projects
it
was
in
a
best
interest
to
improve
the
lab
software
infrastructure
and
one
of
stallman
biggest
pet
projects
during
this
period
was
the
lab
editor
program
teco
the
story
of
stallman
work
on
teco
during
the
is
inextricably
linked
with
stallman
later
leadership
of
the
free
software
movement
it
is
also
a
significant
stage
in
the
history
of
computer
evolution
so
much
so
that
a
brief
recapitulation
of
that
evolution
is
necessary
during
the
and
when
computers
were
first
appearing
at
universities
computer
programming
was
an
incredibly
abstract
pursuit
to
communicate
with
the
machine
programmers
created
a
series
of
punch
cards
with
each
card
representing
an
individual
software
command
programmers
would
then
hand
the
cards
over
to
a
central
system
administrator
who
would
then
insert
them
one
by
one
into
the
machine
waiting
for
the
machine
to
spit
out
a
new
set
of
punch
cards
which
the
programmer
would
then
decipher
as
output
this
process
known
as
batch
processing
was
cumbersome
and
time
consuming
it
was
also
prone
to
abuses
of
authority
one
of
the
motivating
factors
behind
hackers
inbred
aversion
to
centralization
was
the
power
held
by
early
system
operators
in
dictating
which
jobs
held
top
priority
in
computer
scientists
and
hackers
involved
in
mit
project
mac
an
early
forerunner
of
the
ai
lab
took
steps
to
alleviate
this
frustration
originally
known
as
time
stealing
made
it
possible
for
multiple
programs
to
take
advantage
of
a
operational
capabilities
teletype
interfaces
also
made
it
possible
to
communicate
with
a
machine
not
through
a
series
of
punched
holes
but
through
actual
text
a
programmer
typed
in
commands
and
read
the
output
generated
by
the
machine
during
the
late
interface
design
made
additional
leaps
in
a
famous
lecture
doug
engelbart
a
scientist
then
working
at
the
stanford
research
institute
unveiled
a
prototype
of
the
modern
graphical
interface
rigging
up
a
television
set
to
the
computer
and
adding
a
pointer
device
which
engelbart
dubbed
a
mouse
the
scientist
created
a
system
even
more
interactive
than
the
system
developed
a
mit
treating
the
video
display
like
a
printer
engelbart
system
gave
a
user
the
ability
to
move
the
cursor
around
the
screen
and
see
the
cursor
position
updated
by
the
computer
in
real
time
the
user
suddenly
had
the
ability
to
position
text
anywhere
on
the
screen
such
innovations
would
take
another
two
decades
to
make
their
way
into
the
commercial
marketplace
still
by
the
video
screens
had
started
to
replace
teletypes
as
display
terminals
creating
the
potential
for
opposed
to
capabilities
one
of
the
first
programs
to
take
advantage
of
this
capability
was
the
mit
ai
lab
teco
short
for
text
editor
and
corrector
the
program
had
been
upgraded
by
hackers
from
an
old
teletype
line
editor
for
the
lab
to
the
jargon
file
teco
name
originally
stood
for
tape
editor
and
corrector
teco
was
a
substantial
improvement
over
old
editors
but
it
still
had
its
drawbacks
to
create
and
edit
a
document
a
programmer
had
to
enter
a
series
of
software
commands
specifying
each
edit
it
was
an
abstract
process
unlike
modern
word
processors
which
update
text
with
each
keystroke
teco
demanded
that
the
user
enter
an
extended
series
of
editing
instructions
followed
by
an
end
of
command
sequence
just
to
change
the
time
a
hacker
grew
proficient
enough
to
write
entire
documents
in
edit
mode
but
as
stallman
himself
would
later
point
out
the
process
required
a
mental
skill
like
that
of
blindfold
chess
see
richard
stallman
emacs
the
extensible
customizable
display
editor
ai
lab
memo
an
updated
html
version
of
this
memo
from
which
i
am
quoting
is
available
at
http
to
facilitate
the
process
ai
lab
hackers
had
built
a
system
that
displayed
both
the
source
and
display
modes
on
a
split
screen
despite
this
innovative
hack
switching
from
mode
to
mode
was
still
a
nuisance
teco
was
the
only
editor
floating
around
the
computer
world
at
this
time
during
a
visit
to
the
stanford
artificial
intelligence
lab
in
stallman
encountered
an
edit
program
named
the
program
contained
an
internal
feature
which
allowed
a
user
to
update
display
text
after
each
command
keystroke
in
the
language
of
programming
e
was
one
of
the
first
rudimentary
wysiwyg
editors
short
for
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
wysiwyg
meant
that
a
user
could
manipulate
the
file
by
moving
through
the
displayed
text
as
opposed
to
working
through
a
editor
program
see
richard
stallman
emacs
the
full
screen
editor
http
impressed
by
the
hack
stallman
looked
for
ways
to
expand
teco
functionality
in
similar
fashion
upon
his
return
to
mit
he
found
a
teco
feature
called
written
by
carl
mikkelson
and
named
after
the
combination
that
triggered
it
hack
switched
teco
from
its
usual
abstract
mode
to
a
more
intuitive
mode
stallman
revised
the
feature
in
a
subtle
but
significant
way
he
made
it
possible
to
trigger
other
teco
command
strings
or
macros
using
other
combinations
where
users
had
once
entered
command
strings
and
discarded
them
after
entering
then
stallman
hack
made
it
possible
to
save
macro
tricks
on
file
and
call
them
up
at
will
mikkelson
hack
had
raised
teco
to
the
level
of
a
wysiwyg
editor
stallman
hack
had
raised
it
to
the
level
of
a
wysiwyg
editor
that
was
the
real
breakthrough
says
guy
steele
a
fellow
ai
lab
hacker
at
the
time
by
stallman
own
recollection
the
macro
hack
touched
off
an
explosion
of
further
innovation
everybody
and
his
brother
was
writing
his
own
collection
of
redefined
commands
a
command
for
everything
he
typically
liked
to
do
stallman
would
later
recall
people
would
pass
them
around
and
improve
them
making
them
more
powerful
and
more
general
the
collections
of
redefinitions
gradually
became
system
programs
in
their
own
right
so
many
people
found
the
macro
innovations
useful
and
had
incorporated
it
into
their
own
teco
programs
that
the
teco
editor
had
become
secondary
to
the
macro
mania
it
inspired
we
started
to
categorize
it
mentally
as
a
programming
language
rather
than
as
an
editor
stallman
says
users
were
experiencing
their
own
pleasure
tweaking
the
software
and
trading
new
ideas
two
years
after
the
explosion
the
rate
of
innovation
began
to
exhibit
dangerous
side
effects
the
explosive
growth
had
provided
an
exciting
validation
of
the
collaborative
hacker
approach
but
it
had
also
led
to
we
had
a
tower
of
babel
effect
says
guy
steele
the
effect
threatened
to
kill
the
spirit
that
had
created
it
steele
says
hackers
had
designed
its
to
facilitate
programmers
ability
to
share
knowledge
and
improve
each
other
work
that
meant
being
able
to
sit
down
at
another
programmer
desk
open
up
a
programmer
work
and
make
comments
and
modifications
directly
within
the
software
sometimes
the
easiest
way
to
show
somebody
how
to
program
or
debug
something
was
simply
to
sit
down
at
the
terminal
and
do
it
for
them
explains
steele
the
macro
feature
after
its
second
year
began
to
foil
this
capability
in
their
eagerness
to
embrace
the
new
capabilities
hackers
had
customized
their
versions
of
teco
to
the
point
where
a
hacker
sitting
down
at
another
hacker
terminal
usually
had
to
spend
the
first
hour
just
figuring
out
what
macro
commands
did
what
frustrated
steele
took
it
upon
himself
to
the
solve
the
problem
he
gathered
together
the
four
different
macro
packages
and
began
assembling
a
chart
documenting
the
most
useful
macro
commands
in
the
course
of
implementing
the
design
specified
by
the
chart
steele
says
he
attracted
stallman
attention
he
started
looking
over
my
shoulder
asking
me
what
i
was
doing
recalls
steele
for
steele
a
hacker
who
interacted
with
stallman
infrequently
the
memory
still
sticks
out
looking
over
another
hacker
shoulder
while
he
worked
was
a
common
activity
at
the
ai
lab
stallman
the
teco
maintainer
at
the
lab
deemed
steele
work
interesting
and
quickly
set
off
to
complete
it
as
i
like
to
say
i
did
the
first
percent
of
the
implementation
and
stallman
did
the
rest
says
steele
with
a
laugh
the
project
new
name
emacs
came
courtesy
of
stallman
short
for
editing
macros
it
signified
the
evolutionary
transcendence
that
had
taken
place
during
the
macros
explosion
two
years
before
it
also
took
advantage
of
a
gap
in
the
software
programming
lexicon
noting
a
lack
of
programs
on
its
starting
with
the
letter
e
stallman
chose
emacs
making
it
possible
to
reference
the
program
with
a
single
letter
once
again
the
hacker
lust
for
efficiency
had
left
its
mark
in
the
course
of
developing
a
standard
system
of
macro
commands
stallman
and
steele
had
to
traverse
a
political
tightrope
in
creating
a
standard
program
stallman
was
in
clear
violation
of
the
fundamental
hacker
promote
decentralization
he
was
also
threatening
to
hobble
the
very
flexibility
that
had
fueled
teco
explosive
innovation
in
the
first
place
on
the
one
hand
we
were
trying
to
make
a
uniform
command
set
again
on
the
other
hand
we
wanted
to
keep
it
open
ended
because
the
programmability
was
important
recalls
steele
to
solve
the
problem
stallman
steele
and
fellow
hackers
david
moon
and
dan
weinreib
limited
their
standardization
effort
to
the
wysiwyg
commands
that
controlled
how
text
appeared
the
rest
of
the
emacs
effort
would
be
devoted
to
retaining
the
program
tinker
extensibility
stallman
now
faced
another
conundrum
if
users
made
changes
but
did
communicate
those
changes
back
to
the
rest
of
the
community
the
tower
of
babel
effect
would
simply
emerge
in
other
places
falling
back
on
the
hacker
doctrine
of
sharing
innovation
stallman
embedded
a
statement
within
the
source
code
that
set
the
terms
of
use
users
were
free
to
modify
and
redistribute
the
code
on
the
condition
that
they
gave
back
all
the
extensions
they
made
stallman
dubbed
it
the
emacs
commune
just
as
teco
had
become
more
than
a
simple
editor
emacs
had
become
more
than
a
simple
software
program
to
stallman
it
was
a
social
contract
in
an
early
memo
documenting
the
project
stallman
spelled
out
the
contract
terms
emacs
he
wrote
was
distributed
on
a
basis
of
communal
sharing
which
means
that
all
improvements
must
be
given
back
to
me
to
be
incorporated
and
distributed
see
stallman
not
everybody
accepted
the
contract
the
explosive
innovation
continued
throughout
the
decade
resulting
in
a
host
of
programs
with
varying
degrees
of
a

initially
as
a
devoted
exponent

stallman
saw
no
reason
to
halt
this
innovation
through
legal
harassment
still
the
fact
that
some
people
would
so
eagerly
take
software
from
the
community
chest
alter
it
and
slap
a
new
name
on
the
resulting
software
displayed
a
stunning
lack
of
courtesy
such
rude
behavior
was
reflected
against
other
unsettling
developments
in
the
hacker
community

decision
to
embed
time
bombs
in
scribe
making
it
possible
for
unilogic
to
limit
unpaid
user
access
to

was
a
dark
omen
to
stallman
he
considered
it
the
most
nazi
thing
he
ever
saw
in
his
life
recalls
reid
despite
going
on
to
later
internet
fame
as
the
cocreator
of
the
usenet
alt
heirarchy
reid
says
he
still
has
yet
to
live
down
that
decision
at
least
in
stallman
eyes
he
said
that
all
software
should
be
free
and
the
prospect
of
charging
money
for
software
was
a
crime
against
humanity
in
a
interview
with
online
magazine
meme
stallman
cited
scribe
sale
as
irksome
but
hesitated
to
mention
reid
by
name
the
problem
was
nobody
censured
or
punished
this
student
for
what
he
did
stallman
said
the
result
was
other
people
got
tempted
to
follow
his
example

although
stallman
had
been
powerless
to
head
off

he
did
possess
the
ability
to
curtail
other
forms
of
behavior
deemed
contrary
to
the
hacker
ethos
as
central
maintainer
for

to
wield
his
power
for
political
effect
during
his
final
stages
of
conflict
with
the
administrators
at

laboratory
for

over

stallman
initiated

the
move
did
little

reputation
as
an
extremist

it
got
the
point
across

it

later
emacs
developers
adopted
an

represent

that
the
idea
that
we
wanted
to
convey
says
stallman
the
amount
of

it

contained
within

is
both
wonderful
and
awful
at
the

an

who
worked

during

would
later
assist
stallman
as
a
charter
boardmember
of
the
free

foundation
describes
emacs
as
an
absolutely
brilliant
creation
in
giving
programmers
a
way
to
add
new
software
libraries
and
features
without
messing
up
the
system
abelson
says
stallman
paved
the
way
for
future
collaborative
software
projects
its
structure
was
robust
enough
that
you
have
people
all
over
the
world
who
were
loosely
collaborating
and
contributing
to
it
abelson
says
i
do
know
if
that
had
been
done
before
in
writing
this
chapter
i
elected
to
focus
more
on
the
social
significance
of
emacs
than
the
software
significance
to
read
more
about
the
software
side
i
recommend

i
particularly
recommend
the
section
titled
research
through

of

not
only
is
it
accessible
to
the
nontechnical

it
also
sheds
light
on
how
closely
intertwined
stallman
political
philosophies
are
with
his

a
sample
excerpt

emacs
could
not
have
been
reached
by
a
process
of
careful
design
because
such
processes
arrive
only
at
goals
which
are
visible
at
the
outset
and
whose
desirability
is
established
on
the
bottom
line
at
the
outset
neither
i
nor
anyone
else
visualized
an
extensible
editor
until
i
had
made
one
nor
appreciated
its
value
until
he
had
experienced
it
emacs
exists
because
i
felt
free
to
make
individually
useful
small
improvements
on
a
path
whose
end
was
not
in
sight
guy
steele
expresses
similar
admiration
currently
a
research
scientist
for
sun
microsystems
he
remembers
stallman
primarily
as
a
brilliant
programmer
with
the
ability
to
generate
large
quantities
of
relatively
code
although
their
personalities
exactly
mesh
steele
and
stallman
collaborated
long
enough
for
steele
to
get
a
glimpse
of
intense
coding
style
he
recalls
a
notable
episode
in
the
late
when
the
two
programmers
banded
together
to
write
the
editor
pretty
print
feature
originally
conceived
by
steele
pretty
print
was
another
feature
that
reformatted
emacs
source
code
so
that
it
was
both
more
readable
and
took
up
less
space
further
bolstering
the
program
wysiwig
qualities
the
feature
was
strategic
enough
to
attract
stallman
active
interest
and
it
was
long
before
steele
wrote
that
he
and
stallman
were
planning
an
improved
version
we
sat
down
one
morning
recalls
steele
i
was
at
the
keyboard
and
he
was
at
my
elbow
says
steele
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
let
me
type
but
he
was
also
telling
me
what
to
type
the
programming
session
lasted
hours
throughout
that
entire
time
steele
says
neither
he
nor
stallman
took
a
break
or
made
any
small
talk
by
the
end
of
the
session
they
had
managed
to
hack
the
pretty
print
source
code
to
just
under
lines
my
fingers
were
on
the
keyboard
the
whole
time
steele
recalls
but
it
felt
like
both
of
our
ideas
were
flowing
onto
the
screen
he
told
me
what
to
type
and
i
typed
it
the
length
of
the
session
revealed
itself
when
steele
finally
left
the
ai
lab
standing
outside
the
building
at
tech
square
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
surrounded
by
nighttime
darkness
as
a
programmer
steele
was
used
to
marathon
coding
sessions
still
something
about
this
session
was
different
working
with
stallman
had
forced
steele
to
block
out
all
external
stimuli
and
focus
his
entire
mental
energies
on
the
task
at
hand
looking
back
steele
says
he
found
the
stallman
both
exhilarating
and
scary
at
the
same
time
my
first
thought
afterward
was
it
was
a
great
experience
very
intense
and
that
i
never
wanted
to
do
it
again
in
my
life
a
stark
moral
choice
on
september
computer
programmers
logging
on
to
the
usenet
newsgroup
encountered
an
unusual

posted
in
the
small
hours
of
the

to
be

and
signed

the

subject

was
terse
but

it
read
instead
of
introducing
a
newly

however
the

opening

issued
a
call
to

a

the
message
was
a
mixture
of
idealism
and
hubris
not
only
did
the
author
pledge
to
rebuild
the
already
mature
unix
operating
system
from
the
ground
up
he
also
proposed
to
improve
it
in
places
the

the

predicted

carry
all
the

a

a

and
a
few
other

make
all
improvements
that
are

based
on
our

however
stallman
made
good
on
his
promise
and
fully
immersed
himself
in
the
world
of
unix
software
development
for
a
software
architect
raised
on
its
it
was
like
designing
suburban
shopping
malls
instead
of
moorish
palaces
even
so
building
a

had
its
hidden
advantages
its
had
been
powerful

it
also
possessed

originally

by

slipped
out
under
radar
finding
a
happy
home
in
the
world
of
academic
computer
systems
with
fewer
resources
than
their
mit
brethren
unix

had
customized
the

to

such
as

by
a

most
notably
sun
microsystems
were
even
going
so
far
as
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
microcomputers
dubbed
workstations
to
take
advantage
of
the
increasingly
ubiquitous
operating
system
to
facilitate
this
process
the
developers
in
charge
of
designing
the
dominant
unix
strains
made
sure
to
keep
an
extra
layer
of
abstraction
between
the
software
and
the
machine
instead
of
tailoring
the
operating
system
to
take
advantage
of
a
specific
machine
the
ai
lab
hackers
had
done
with
its
and
the
developers
favored
a
more
generic
approach
focusing
more
on
the
interlocking
standards
and
specifications
that
held
the
operating
system
many
subcomponents
together
rather
than
the
actual
components
themselves
they
created
a
system
that
could
be
quickly
modified
to
suit
the
tastes
of
any
machine
if
a
user
quibbled
with
a
certain
portion
the
standards
made
it
possible
to
pull
out
an
individual
subcomponent
and
either
fix
it
or
replace
it
with
something
better
simply
put
what
the
unix
approach
lacked
in
terms
of
style
or
aesthetics
it
more
than
made
up

the

began
to
undergo
a
demographic
change
the

he
came
up
with

a
way
to
avoid

the

its
own
derisive
nickname
oz
according
to
one

legend
the

got
its

because
it
required
a
smaller

to
power
its

one

upon
viewing

boast

software

had
designed

became
an
battle
over

argued
that
without

was
more
prone
to
accidental
crashes
hackers
argued
that

could
be
better
prevented
by
overhauling
the

code
unfortunately
the
number
of
hackers
with
the
time
and
inclination
to
perform
this
sort
of
overhaul
had
dwindled
to
the
point
that
the

prevailed

crashing

one
such

learned
through

that
all
an

needed

do

to

his
policy
of
repeating
his
login
id
as
a
password
so
outside
users
could
follow
in
his
footsteps
over
time
however
the

fragility
prompted

to
bar
outsiders
who
through
sheer
accident
or
malicious
intent
might
bring
down
the

when
those

eventually
demanded
that

stop
publishing
his

personal
ethics
refused
to
do
so
and
ceased
using
the

appeared

decided
to
follow
my

stallman

later
say

that
it

such
a

limited

of

hoping
to

it

to
secure

to
bolster

and
set

working

various
components
of

outside

the
most
aggressive
in
this
strategy
was
symbolics
by

stallman
accepted
both
companies
attempt
to
commercialize
the

even
though
it
meant
more
work
for
him
both
licensed
the
lisp

os

from

and
it
was
stallman
job
to
update
the

own
lisp

to
keep
pace
with
the
latest
innovations
although
symbolics
license
with
mit
gave
stallman
the
right
to
review
but
not
copy
symbolics
source
code
stallman
says
a
agreement
between
symbolics
management
and
the
ai
lab
made
it
possible
to
borrow
attractive
snippets
in
traditional
hacker
fashion
on
march
a
date
stallman
remembers
well
because
it
was
his
birthday
symbolics
executives
decided
to
end
this
gentlemen
agreement
the
move
was
largely
strategic
lmi
the
primary
competition
in
the
lisp
machine
marketplace
was
essentially
using
a
copy
of
the
ai
lab
lisp
machine
rather
than
subsidize
the
development
of
a
market
rival
symbolics
executives
elected
to
enforce
the
letter
of
the
license
if
the
ai
lab
wanted
its
operating
system
to
stay
current
with
the
symbolics
operating
system
the
lab
would
have
to
switch
over
to
a
symbolics
machine
and
sever
its
connection
to
lmi
as
the
person
responsible
for
keeping
up
the
lab
lisp
machine
stallman
was
incensed
viewing
this
announcement
as
an
ultimatum
he
retaliated
by
disconnecting
symbolics
microwave
communications
link
to
the
laboratory
he
then
vowed
never
to
work
on
a
symbolics
machine
and
pledged
his
immediate
allegiance
to
lmi
the
way
i
saw
it
the
ai
lab
was
a
neutral
country
like
belgium
in
world
war
i
stallman
says
if
germany
invades
belgium
belgium
declares
war
on
germany
and
sides
with
britain
and
france
the
circumstances
of
the
symbolics
war
of
depend
heavily
on
the
source
doing
the
telling
when
symbolics
executives
noticed
that
their
latest
features
were
still
appearing
in
the
ai
lab
lisp
machine
and
by
extension
the
lmi
lisp
machine
they
installed
a
spy
program
on
stallman
computer
terminal
stallman
says
he
was
rewriting
the
features
from
scratch
taking
advantage
of
the
license
review
clause
but
also
taking
pains
to
make
the
source
code
as
different
as
possible
symbolics
executives
argued
otherwise
and
took
their
case
to
mit
administration
according
to
book
the
brain
makers
genius
ego
and
greed
and
the
quest
for
machines
that
think
written
by
harvey
newquist
the
administration
responded
with
a
warning
to
stallman
to
stay
away
from
the
lisp
machine
according
to
stallman
mit
administrators
backed
stallman
up
i
was
never
threatened
he
says
i
did
make
changes
in
my
practices
though
just
to
be
ultra
safe
i
no
longer
read
their
source
code
i
used
only
the
documentation
and
wrote
the
code
from
that
whatever
the
outcome
the
bickering
solidified
stallman
resolve
with
no
source
code
to
review
stallman
filled
in
the
software
gaps
according
to
his
own
tastes
and
enlisted
members
of
the
ai
lab
to
provide
a
continuous
stream
of
bug
reports
he
also
made
sure
lmi
programmers
had
direct
access
to
the
changes
i
was
going
to
punish
symbolics
if
it
was
the
last
thing
i
did
stallman
says
such
statements
are
revealing
not
only
do
they
shed
light
on
stallman
nonpacifist
nature
they
also
reflect
the
intense
level
of
emotion
triggered
by
the
conflict
according
to
another
story
stallman
became
so
irate
at
one
point
that
he
issued
an
email
threatening
to
wrap
myself
in
dynamite
and
walk
into
symbolics
ibid
newquist
who
says
this
anecdote
was
confirmed
by
several
symbolics
executives
writes
the
message
caused
a
brief
flurry
of
excitement
and
speculation
on
the
part
of
symbolics
employees
but
ultimately
no
one
took
stallman
outburst
that
seriously
although
stallman
would
deny
any
memory
of
the
email
and
still
describes
its
existence
as
a
vicious
rumor
he
acknowledges
that
such
thoughts
did
enter
his
head
i
definitely
did
have
fantasies
of
killing
myself
and
destroying
their
building
in
the
process
stallman
says
i
thought
my
life
was
over
the
level
of
despair
owed
much
to
what
stallman
viewed
as
the
destruction
of
his
home
the
demise
of
the
ai
lab
hacker
subculture
in
a
later
email
interview
with
levy
stallman
would
liken
himself
to
the
historical
figure
ishi
the
last
surviving
member
of
the
yahi
a
pacific
northwest
tribe
wiped
out
during
the
indian
wars
of
the
and
the
analogy
casts
stallman
survival
in
epic
almost
mythical
terms
in
reality
however
it
glosses
over
the
tension
between
stallman
and
his
fellow
ai
lab
hackers
prior
to
the
schism
instead
of
seeing
symbolics
as
an
exterminating
force
many
of
stallman
colleagues
saw
it
as
a
belated
bid
for
relevance
in
commercializing
the
lisp
machine
the
company
pushed
hacker
principles
of
software
design
out
of
the
confines
of
the
ai
lab
and
into
the
corporate
marketplace
where
design
principles
held
sway
rather
than
viewing
stallman
as
a
holdout
many
hackers
saw
him
as
a
troubling
anachronism
stallman
does
not
dispute
this
alternate
view
of
historical
events
in
fact
he
says
it
was
yet
another
reason
for
the
hostility
triggered
by
the
symbolics
ultimatum
even
before
symbolics
hired
away
most
of
the
ai
lab
hacker
staff
stallman
says
many
of
the
hackers
who
later
joined
symbolics
were
shunning
him
i
was
no
longer
getting
invited
to
go
to
chinatown
stallman
recalls
the
custom
started
by
greenblatt
was
that
if
you
went
out
to
dinner
you
went
around
or
sent
a
message
asking
anybody
at
the
lab
if
they
also
wanted
to
go
sometime
around
i
stopped
getting
asked
they
were
not
only
not
inviting
me
but
one
person
later
confessed
that
he
had
been
pressured
to
lie
to
me
to
keep
their
going
away
to
dinner
without
me
a
secret
although
stallman
felt
anger
toward
the
hackers
who
orchestrated
this
petty
form
of
ostracism
the
symbolics
controversy
dredged
up
a
new
kind
of
anger
the
anger
of
a
person
about
to
lose
his
home
when
symbolics
stopped
sending
over
its
changes
stallman
responded
by
holing
up
in
his
mit
offices
and
rewriting
each
new
software
feature
and
tool
from
scratch
frustrating
as
it
may
have
been
it
guaranteed
that
future
lisp
machine
users
had
unfettered
access
to
the
same
features
as
symbolics
users
it
also
guaranteed
stallman
legendary
status
within
the
hacker
community
already
renowned
for
his
work
with
emacs

for

the
months
spent
playing

evoke
a
mixture
of
pride
and
profound
sadness
as
a
liberal
whose
father
had
served
in
world
war
ii
stallman
is
no
pacifist
in
many
ways
the
symbolics
war
offered
the
rite
of
passage
toward
which
stallman
had
been
careening
ever
since
joining
the
ai
lab
staff
a
decade
before
at
the
same
time
however
it
coincided
with
the
traumatic
destruction
of
the
ai
lab
hacker
culture
that
had
nurtured
stallman
since
his
teenage
years
one
day
while
taking
a
break
from
writing
code
stallman
experienced
a
traumatic
moment
passing
through
the
lab
equipment
room
there
stallman
encountered
the
hulking
unused
frame
of
the
machine
startled
by
the
dormant
lights
lights
that
once
actively
blinked
out
a
silent
code
indicating
the
status
of
the
internal
program
stallman
says
the
emotional
impact
was
not
unlike
coming
across
a
beloved
family
corpse
i
started
crying
right
there
in
the
equipment
room
he
says
seeing
the
machine
there
dead
with
nobody
left
to
fix
it
it
all
drove
home
how
completely
my
community
had
been
destroyed
stallman
would
have
little
opportunity
to
mourn
the
lisp
machine
despite
all
the
furor
it
invoked
and
all
the
labor
that
had
gone
into
making
it
was
merely
a
sideshow
to
the
large
battles
in
the
technology
marketplace
the
relentless
pace
of
computer
miniaturization
was
bringing
in
newer
more
powerful
microprocessors
that
would
soon
incorporate
the
machine
hardware
and
software
capabilities
like
a
modern
metropolis
swallowing
up
an
ancient
desert
village
riding
atop
this
microprocessor
wave
were
commercial
software
programs
each
protected
by
a
patchwork
of
user
licenses
and
nondisclosure
agreements
that
made
it
impossible
for
hackers
to
review
or
share
source
code
the
licenses
were
crude
and
but
by
they
had
become
strong
enough
to
satisfy
the
courts
and
scare
away
interlopers
software
once
a
form
of
garnish
most
hardware
companies
gave
away
to
make
their
expensive
computer
systems
more
flavorful
was
quickly
becoming
the
main
dish
in
their
increasing
hunger
for
new
games
and
features
users
were
putting
aside
the
traditional
demand
to
review
the
recipe
after
every
meal
nowhere
was
this
state
of
affairs
more
evident
than
in
the
realm
of
personal
computer
systems
companies
such
as
apple
computer
and
commodore
were
minting
fresh
millionaires
selling
machines
with
operating
systems
unaware
of
the
hacker
culture
and
its
distaste
for
software
many
of
these
users
saw
little
need
to
protest
when
these
companies
failed
to
attach
the
accompanying
files
a
few
anarchic
adherents
of
the
hacker
ethic
helped
propel
that
ethic
into
this
new
marketplace
but
for
the
most
part
the
marketplace
rewarded
the
programmers
speedy
enough
to
write
new
programs
and
savvy
enough
to
copyright
them
as
legally
protected
works
one
of
the
most
notorious
of
these
programmers
was
bill
gates
a
harvard
dropout
two
years
stallman
junior
although
stallman
did
know
it
at
the
time
seven
years
before
sending
out
his
message
to
the
n
newsgroup
gates
a
budding
entrepreneur
and
general
partner
with
the

firm
later
spelled

sent

his

open

to
the

although
few
hackers
at
the
ai
lab
saw
the
missive
gates
letter
nevertheless
represented
the
changing
attitude
toward
software
both
among
commercial
software
companies
and
commercial
software
developers
why
treat
software
as
a
commodity
when
the
market
said
otherwise
as
the
gave
way
to
the
selling
software
became
more
than
a
way
to
recoup
costs
it
became
a
political
statement
at
a
time
when
the
reagan
administration
was
rushing
to
dismantle
many
of
the
federal
regulations
and
spending
programs
that
had
been
built
up
during
the
half
century
following
the
great
depression
more
than
a
few
software
programmers
saw
the
hacker
ethic
as
anticompetitive
and
by
extension
at
best
it
was
a
throwback
to
the
anticorporate
attitudes
of
the
late
and
early
like
a
wall
street
banker
discovering
an
old
shirt
hiding
between
shirts
and
suits
many
computer
programmers
treated
the
hacker
ethic
as
an
embarrassing
reminder
of
an
idealistic
age
for
a
man
who
had
spent
the
entire
as
an
embarrassing
throwback
to
the
stallman
mind
living
out
of
step
with
his
peers
as
a
programmer
used
to
working
with
the
best
machines
and
the
best
software
however
stallman
faced
what
he
could
only
describe
as
a
stark
moral
choice
either
get
over
his
ethical
objection
for
proprietary
term
stallman
and
his
fellow
hackers
used
to
describe
any
program
that
carried
private
copyright
or
license
that
restricted
copying
and
dedicate
his
life
to
building
an
alternate
nonproprietary
system
of
software
programs
given
his
recent
ordeal
with
symbolics
stallman
felt
more
comfortable
with
the
latter
option
i
suppose
i
could
have
stopped
working
on
computers
altogether
stallman
says
i
had
no
special
skills
but
i
sure
i
could
have
become
a
waiter
not
at
a
fancy
restaurant
probably
but
i
could
been
a
waiter
somewhere
being
a
dropping
out
of
programming
have
meant
completely
giving
up
an
activity
computer
programming
that
had
given
him
so
much
pleasure
looking
back
on
his
life
since
moving
to
cambridge
stallman
finds
it
easy
to
identify
lengthy
periods
when
software
programming
provided
the
only
pleasure
rather
than
drop
out
stallman
decided
to
stick
it
out
an
atheist
stallman
rejects
notions
such
as
fate
dharma
or
a
divine
calling
in
life
nevertheless
he
does
feel
that
the
decision
to
shun
proprietary
software
and
build
an
operating
system
to
help
others
do
the
same
was
a
natural
one
after
all
it
was
stallman
own
personal
combination
of
stubbornness
foresight
and
coding
virtuosity
that
led
him
to
consider
a
fork
in
the
road
most
others
did
know
existed
in
describing
the
decision
in
a
chapter
for
the
book
open
sources
stallman
cites
the
spirit
encapsulated
in
the
words
of
the
jewish
sage
hillel
if
i
am
not
for
myself
who
will
be
for
me
if
i
am
only
for
myself
what
am
i
if
not
now
when
see
richard
stallman
open
sources
associates
stallman
adds
his
own
footnote
to
this
statement
writing
as
an
atheist
i
do
follow
any
religious
leaders
but
i
sometimes
find
i
admire
something
one
of
them
has
said
speaking
to
audiences
stallman
avoids
the
religious
route
and
expresses
the
decision
in
pragmatic
terms
i
asked
myself
what
could
i
an
developer
do
to
improve
the
situation
it
was
until
i
examined
the
question
for
a
while
that
i
realized
an
developer
was
exactly
what
was
needed
to
solve
the
problem
once
he
reached
that
decision
stallman
says
everything
else
fell
into
place
he
would
abstain
from
using
software
programs
that
forced
him
to
compromise
his
ethical
beliefs
while
at
the
same
time
devoting
his
life
to
the
creation
of
software
that
would
make
it
easier
for
others
to
follow
the
same
path
pledging
to
build
a
free
software
operating
system
or
die
old
age
of
course
stallman
quips
he
resigned
from
the
mit
staff
in
january
to
build
gnu
the
resignation
distanced
stallman
work
from
the
legal
auspices
of
mit
still
stallman
had
enough
friends
and
allies
within
the
ai
lab
to
retain
access
to
his
mit
office
he
also
had
the
ability
to
secure
outside
consulting
gigs
to
underwrite
the
early
stages
of
the
gnu
project
in
resigning
from
mit
however
stallman
negated
any
debate
about
conflict
of
interest
or

ownership
of
the
software
the
man
whose
early
adulthood
fear
of
social
isolation
had
driven
him
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
ai
lab
embrace
was
now
building
a
legal
firewall
between
himself
and
that
environment
for
the
first
few
months
stallman
operated
in
isolation
from
the
unix
community
as
well
although
his
announcement
to
the
group
had
attracted
sympathetic
responses
few
volunteers
signed
on
to
join
the
crusade
in
its
early
stages
the
community
reaction
was
pretty
much
uniform
recalls
rich
morin
leader
of
a
unix
user
group
at
the
time
people
said
that
a
great
idea
show
us
your
code
show
us
it
can
be
done
in
true
hacker
fashion
stallman
began
looking
for
existing
programs
and
tools
that
could
be
converted
into
gnu
programs
and
tools
one
of
the
first
was
a
compiler
named
vuck
which
converted
programs
written
in
the
popular
c
programming
language
into
code
translated
from
the
dutch
the
program
acronym
stood
for
the
free
university
compiler
kit
optimistic
stallman
asked
the
author
if
the
program
was
free
when
the
author
informed
him
that
the
words
free
university
were
a
reference
to
the
vrije
universiteit
in
amsterdam
stallman
was
chagrined
he
responded
derisively
stating
that
the
university
was
free
but
the
compiler
was
not
recalls
stallman
i
therefore
decided
that
my
first
program
for
the
gnu
project
would
be
a
compiler
eventually
stallman
found
a
pastel
language
compiler
written
by
programmers
at
lawrence
livermore
national
lab
according
to
stallman
knowledge
at
the
time
the
compiler
was
free
to
copy
and
modify
unfortunately
the
program
possessed
a
sizable
design
flaw
it
saved
each
program
into
core
memory
tying
up
precious
space
for
other
software
activities
on
mainframe
systems
this
design
flaw
had
been
forgivable
on
unix
systems
it
was
a
crippling
barrier
since
the
machines
that
ran
unix
were
too
small
to
handle
the
large
files
generated
stallman
made
substantial
progress
at
first
building
a
frontend
to
the
compiler
by
summer
however
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
have
to
build
a
totally
new
compiler
from
scratch
in
september
of
stallman
shelved
compiler
development
for
the
near
term
and
began
searching
for
fruit
he
began
development
of
a
gnu
version
of
emacs
the
program
he
himself
had
been
supervising
for
a
decade
the
decision
was
strategic
within
the
unix
community
the
two
native
editor
programs
were
vi
written
by
sun
microsystems
cofounder
bill
joy
and
ed
written
by
bell
labs
scientist
and
unix
cocreator
ken
thompson
both
were
useful
and
popular
but
neither
offered
the
endlessly
expandable
nature
of
emacs
in
rewriting
emacs
for
the
unix
audience
stallman
stood
a
better
chance
of
showing
off
his
skills
it
also
stood
to
reason
that
emacs
users
might
be
more
attuned
to
the
stallman
mentality
looking
back
stallman
says
he
did
view
the
decision
in
strategic
terms
i
wanted
an
emacs
and
i
had
a
good
opportunity
to
develop
one
once
again
the
notion
of
reinventing
the
wheel
grated
on
stallman
efficient
hacker
sensibilities
in
writing
a
unix
version
of
emacs
stallman
was
soon
following
the
footsteps
of
carnegie
mellon
graduate
student
james
gosling
author
of
a
version
dubbed
gosling
emacs
or
gosmacs
gosling
version
of
emacs
included
an
interpreter
that
exploited
a
simplified
offshoot
of
the
lisp
language
called
mocklisp
determined
to
build
gnu
emacs
on
a
similar
lisp
foundation
stallman
borrowed
copiously
from
gosling
innovations
although
gosling
had
put
gosmacs
under
copyright
and
had
sold
the
rights
to
unipress
a
privately
held
software
company
stallman
cited
the
assurances
of
a
fellow
developer
who
had
participated
in
the
early
mocklisp
interpreter
according
to
the
developer
gosling
while
a
student
at
carnegie
mellon
had
assured
early
collaborators
that
their
work
would
remain
accessible
when
unipress
caught
wind
of
stallman
project
however
the
company
threatened
to
enforce
the
copyright
once
again
stallman
faced
the
prospect
of
building
from
the
ground
up
in
the
course
of
interpreter
stallman
would
create
a
fully
functional
lisp
interpreter
rendering
the
need
for
original
interpreter
moot
nevertheless
the
notion
of
developers
selling
off
software
the
very
notion
of
developers
having
software
rights
to
sell
in
the
first
stallman
in
a
speech
at
the
swedish
royal
technical
institute
stallman
cited
the
unipress
incident
as
yet
another
example
of
the
dangers
associated
with
proprietary
software
sometimes
i
think
that
perhaps
one
of
the
best
things
i
could
do
with
my
life
is
find
a
gigantic
pile
of
proprietary
software
that
was
a
trade
secret
and
start
handing
out
copies
on
a
street
corner
so
it
would
be
a
trade
secret
any
more
said
stallman
perhaps
that
would
be
a
much
more
efficient
way
for
me
to
give
people
new
free
software
than
actually
writing
it
myself
but
everyone
is
too
cowardly
to
even
take
it
despite
the
stress
it
generated
the
dispute
over
gosling
innovations
would
assist
both
stallman
and
the
free
software
movement
in
the
long
term
it
would
force
stallman
to
address
the
weaknesses
of
the
emacs
commune
and
the
informal
trust
system
that
had
allowed
problematic
offshoots
to
emerge
it
would
also
force
stallman
to
sharpen
the
free
software
political
objectives
following
the
release
of
gnu
emacs
in
stallman
issued
the
gnu
manifesto
an
expansion
of
the
original
announcement
posted
in
september
stallman
included
within
the
document
a
lengthy
section
devoted
to
the
many
arguments
used
by
commercial
and
academic
programmers
to
justify
the
proliferation
of
proprietary
software
programs
one
argument
do
programmers
deserve
a
reward
for
their
creativity
earned
a
response
encapsulating
anger
over
the
recent
gosling
emacs
episode
if
anything
deserves
a
reward
it
is
social
contribution
stallman
wrote
creativity
can
be
a
social
contribution
but
only
in
so
far
sic
as
society
is
free
to
use
the
results
if
programmers
deserve
to
be
rewarded
for
creating
innovative
programs
by
the
same
token
they
deserve
to
be
punished
if
they
restrict
the
use
of
these
programs
see
richard
stallman
the
gnu
manifesto
http
with
the
release
of
gnu
emacs
the
gnu
project
finally
had
code
to
show
it
also
had
the
burdens
of
any
enterprise
as
more
and
more
unix
developers
began
playing
with
the
software
money
gifts
and
requests
for
tapes
began
to
pour
in
to
address
the
business
side
of
the
gnu
project
stallman
drafted
a
few
of
his
colleagues
and
formed
the
free
software
foundation
fsf
a
nonprofit
organization
dedicated
to
speeding
the
gnu
project
towards
its
goal
with
stallman
as
president
and
various
hacker
allies
as
board
members
the
fsf
helped
provide
a
corporate
face
for
the
gnu
project
robert
chassell
a
programmer
then
working
at
lisp
machines
became
one
of
five
charter
board
members
at
the
free
software
foundation
following
a
dinner
conversation
with
stallman
chassell
also
served
as
the
organization
treasurer
a
role
that
started
small
but
quickly
grew
i
think
in
our
total
expenses
and
revenue
were
something
in
the
order
of
give
or
take
chassell
recalls
richard
had
his
office
and
we
borrowed
space
i
put
all
the
stuff
especially
the
tapes
under
my
desk
it
was
until
sometime
later
lmi
loaned
us
some
space
where
we
could
store
tapes
and
things
of
that
sort
in
addition
to
providing
a
face
the
free
software
foundation
provided
a
center
of
gravity
for
other
disenchanted
programmers
the
unix
market
that
had
seemed
so
collegial
even
at
the
time
of
initial
gnu
announcement
was
becoming
increasingly
competitive
in
an
attempt
to
tighten
their
hold
on
customers
companies
were
starting
to
close
off
access
to
unix
source
code
a
trend
that
only
speeded
the
number
of
inquiries
into
ongoing
gnu
software
projects
the
unix
wizards
who
once
regarded
stallman
as
a
noisy
kook
were
now
beginning
to
see
him
as
a
software
cassandra
a
lot
of
people
do
realize
until
they
had
it
happen
to
them
how
frustrating
it
can
be
to
spend
a
few
years
working
on
a
software
program
only
to
have
it
taken
away
says
chassell
summarizing
the
feelings
and
opinions
of
the
correspondents
writing
in
to
the
fsf
during
the
early
years
after
that
happens
a
couple
of
times
you
start
to
say
to
yourself
wait
a
minute
for
chassell
the
decision
to
participate
in
the
free
software
foundation
came
down
to
his
own
personal
feelings
of
loss
prior
to
lmi
chassell
had
been
working
for
hire
writing
an
introductory
book
on
unix
for
cadmus
a
software
company
when
cadmus
folded
taking
the
rights
to
the
book
down
with
it
chassell
says
he
attempted
to
buy
the
rights
back
with
no
success
as
far
as
i
know
that
book
is
still
sitting
on
shelf
somewhere
unusable
uncopyable
just
taken
out
of
the
system
chassell
says
it
was
quite
a
good
introduction
if
i
may
say
so
myself
it
would
have
taken
maybe
three
or
four
months
to
convert
the
book
into
a
perfectly
usable
introduction
to
today
the
whole
experience
aside
from
what
i
have
in
my
memory
was
lost
forced
to
watch
his
work
sink
into
the
mire
while
his
erstwhile
employer
struggled
through
bankruptcy
chassell
says
he
felt
a
hint
of
the
anger
that
drove
stallman
to
fits
of
apoplexy
the
main
clarity
for
me
was
the
sense
that
if
you
want
to
have
a
decent
life
you
do
want
to
have
bits
of
it
closed
off
chassell
says
this
whole
idea
of
having
the
freedom
to
go
in
and
to
fix
something
and
modify
it
whatever
it
may
be
it
really
makes
a
difference
it
makes
one
think
happily
that
after
you
lived
a
few
years
that
what
you
done
is
worthwhile
because
otherwise
it
just
gets
taken
away
and
thrown
out
or
abandoned
or
at
the
very
least
you
no
longer
have
any
relation
to
it
it
like
losing
a
bit
of
your
life
ignucius
the
maui
high
performance
computing
center
is
located
in
a
building
in
the
dusty
red

just
above
the
town
of
kihei
framed
by
views
and
the
multimillion
dollar
real
estate
of
the
silversword
golf
course
the
center
seems
like
the
ultimate
scientific
boondoggle
far
from
the
boxy
sterile
confines
of
tech
square
or
even
the
sprawling
research
metropolises
of
argonne
illinois
and
los
alamos
new
mexico
the
mhpcc
seems
like
the
kind
of
place
where
scientists
spend
more
time
on
their
tans
than
their
research
projects
the
image
is
only
half
true
although
researchers
at
the
mhpcc
do
take
advantage
of
the
local
recreational
opportunities
they
also
take
their
work
seriously
according
to
a
web
site
that
tracks
the
most
powerful
supercomputers
in
the
world
the
ibm
sp
supercomputer
housed
within
the
mhpcc
clocks
in
at
billion
operations
per

making
it
one
of
most
powerful
computers
in
the
world
and
operated
by
the
university
of
hawaii
and
the
air
force
the
machine
divides
its
computer
cycles
between
the
number
crunching
tasks
associated
with
military
logistics
and
physics
research
simply
put
the
mhpcc
is
a
unique
place
a
place
where
the
brainy
culture
of
science
and
engineering
and
the
culture
of
the
hawaiian
islands
coexist
in
peaceful
equilibrium
a
slogan
on
the
lab
web
site
sums
it
up
computing
in
paradise
it
not
exactly
the
kind
of
place
you
expect
to
find
richard
stallman
a
man
who
when
taking
in
the
beautiful
view
of
the
nearby
maui
channel
through
the
picture
windows
of
a
staffer
office
mutters
a
terse
critique
too
much
sun
still
as
an
emissary
from
one
computing
paradise
to
another
stallman
has
a
message
to
deliver
even
if
it
means
subjecting
his
pale
hacker
skin
to
the
hazards
of
tropical
exposure
the
conference
room
is
already
full
by
the
time
i
arrive
to
catch
stallman
speech
the
gender
breakdown
is
a
little
better
than
at
the
new
york
speech
male
female
but
not
by
much
about
half
of
the
audience
members
wear
khaki
pants
and
golf
shirts
the
other
half
seems
to
have
gone
native
dressed
in
the
gaudy
shirts
so
popular
in
this
corner
of
the
world
their
faces
are
a
deep
shade
of
ochre
the
only
residual
indication
of
geek
status
are
the
gadgets
nokia
cell
phones
palm

and
sony

needless
to
say
stallman
who
stands
in
front
of
the
room
dressed
in
plain
blue
brown
polyester
slacks
and
white
socks
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
fluorescent
lights
of
the
conference
room
help
bring
out
the
unhealthy
color
of
his
skin
his
beard
and
hair
are
enough
to
trigger
beads
of
sweat
on
even
the
coolest
hawaiian
neck
short
of
having
the
words
mainlander
tattooed
on
his

stallman
could
look
more
alien
if
he
tried
as

around
the

offshoot
of

the
venerable
academic
version
of
unix
is
technically
a
competitor
to
the
operating
system
still
in
the
hacking
world
stallman
speeches
are
documented
with
a
fervor
reminiscent
of
the
grateful
dead
and
its
legendary
army
of
amateur
archivists
as
the
local
free
software
heads
it
up
to
the
mfug
members
to
make
sure
fellow
programmers
in
hamburg
mumbai
and
novosibirsk
do
miss
out
on
the
latest
pearls
of
rms
wisdom
the
analogy
to
the
grateful
dead
is
apt
often
when
describing
the
business
opportunities
inherent
within
the
free
software
model
stallman
has
held
up
the
grateful
dead
as
an
example
in
refusing
to
restrict
fans
ability
to
record
live
concerts
the
grateful
dead
became
more
than
a
rock
group
they
became
the
center
of
a
tribal
community
dedicated
to
grateful
dead
music
over
time
that
tribal
community
became
so
large
and
so
devoted
that
the
band
shunned
record
contracts
and
supported
itself
solely
through
musical
tours
and
live
appearances
in
the
band
last
year
as
a
touring
act
the
grateful
dead
drew

receipts

http
while
few
software
companies
have
been
able
to
match
that
success
the
tribal
aspect
of
the
free
software
community
is
one
reason
many
in
the
latter
half
of
the
started
to
accept
the
notion
that
publishing
software
source
code
might
be
a
good
thing
hoping
to
build
their
own
loyal
followings
companies
such
as
ibm
sun
microsystems
and
hewlett
packard
have
come
to
accept
the
letter
if
not
the
spirit
of
the
stallman
free
software
message
describing
the

evan

this

is
letting

take
back

leibovitch
writes
just
as

the
tribal
aspect
of
the
free
software
community
also
helps
explain
why
programmers
who
might
otherwise
be
working
on
physics
projects
or
surfing
the
web
for
windsurfing
buoy
reports
have
packed
into
a
conference
room
to
hear
stallman
speak
unlike
the
new
york
speech
stallman
gets
no
introduction
he
also
offers
no
when
the
freebsd
people
finally
get
their
equipment
up
and
running
stallman
simply
steps
forward
starts
speaking
and
steamrolls
over
every
other
voice
in
the
room
most
of
the
time
when
people
consider
the
question
of
what
rules
society
should
have
for
using
software
the
people
considering
it
are
from
software
companies
and
they
consider
the
question
from
a
perspective
says
stallman
opening
his
speech
what
rules
can
we
impose
on
everybody
else
so
they
have
to
pay
us
lots
of
money
i
had
the
good
fortune
in
the
to
be
part
of
a
community
of
programmers
who
shared
software
and
because
of
this
i
always
like
to
look
at
the
same
issue
from
a
different
direction
to
ask
what
kind
of
rules
make
possible
a
good
society
that
is
good
for
the
people
who
are
in
it
and
therefore
i
reach
completely
different
answers
once
again
stallman
quickly
segues
into
the
parable
of
the
xerox
laser
printer
taking
a
moment
to
deliver
the
same
dramatic
gestures
to
the
crowd
he
also
devotes
a
minute
or
two
to
the
name
some
people
say
to
me
make
such
a
fuss
about
getting
credit
for
this
system
after
all
the
important
thing
is
the
job
is
done
not
whether
you
get
recognition
for
it
well
this
would
be
wise
advice
if
it
were
true
but
the
job
was
to
build
an
operating
system
the
job
is
to
spread
freedom
to
the
users
of
computers
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
make
it
possible
to
do
everything
with
computers
in
freedom
for
narrative
purposes
i
have
hesitated
to
go
when
describing
stallman
full
definition
of
software
freedom
the
gnu
project
web
site
lists
four
fundamental
components
the
freedom
to
run
a
program
for
any
purpose
freedom
the
freedom
to
study
how
a
program
works
and
adapt
it
to
your
needs
freedom
the
freedom
to
redistribute
copies
of
a
program
so
you
can
help
your
neighbor
freedom
the
freedom
to
improve
the
program
and
release
your
improvements
to
the
public
so
that
the
whole
community
benefits
freedom

there
a
lot
more
work
to
do
for
some
in
the
audience
this
is
old
material
for
others
it
a
little
arcane
when
a
member
of
the
contingent
starts
dozing
off
stallman
stops
the
speech
and
asks
somebody
to
wake
the
person
up
somebody
once
said
my
voice
was
so
soothing
he
asked
if
i
was
some
kind
of
healer
says
stallman
drawing
a
quick
laugh
from
the
crowd
i
guess
that
probably
means
i
can
help
you
drift
gently
into
a
blissful
relaxing
sleep
and
some
of
you
might
need
that
i
guess
i
should
object
if
you
do
if
you
need
to
sleep
by
all
means
do
the
speech
ends
with
a
brief
discussion
of
software
patents
a
growing
issue
of
concern
both
within
the
software
industry
and
within
the
free
software
community
like
napster
software
patents
reflect
the
awkward
nature
of
applying
laws
and
concepts
written
for
the
physical
world
to
the
frictionless
universe
of
information
technology
the
difference
between
protecting
a
program
under
copyright
and
protecting
a
program
under
software
patents
is
subtle
but
significant
in
the
case
of
copyright
a
software
creator
can
restrict
duplication
of
the
source
code
but
not
duplication
of
the
idea
or
functionality
that
the
source
code
addresses
in
other
words
if
a
developer
chooses
not
to
use
a
software
program
under
the
original
developer
terms
that
second
developer
is
still
free
to
the
duplicate
the
software
program
functionality
by
rewriting
the
source
code
from
scratch
such
duplication
of
ideas
is
common
within
the
commercial
software
industry
where
companies
often
isolate
teams
to
head
off
accusations
of
corporate
espionage
or
developer
in
the
jargon
of
modern
software
development
companies
refer
to
this
technique
as
clean
room
engineering
software
patents
work
differently
according
to
the
patent
office
companies
and
individuals
may
secure
patents
for
innovative
algorithms
provided
they
submit
their
claims
to
a
public
review
in
theory
this
allows
the
to
trade
off
disclosure
of
their
invention
for
a
limited
monopoly
of
a
minimum
of
years
after
the
patent
filing
in
practice
the
disclosure
is
of
limited
value
since
the
operation
of
the
program
is
often
unlike
copyright
a
patent
gives
its
holder
the
ability
to
head
off
the
independent
development
of
software
programs
with
the
same
or
similar
functionality
in
the
software
industry
where
years
can
cover
the
entire
life
cycle
of
a
marketplace
patents
take
on
a
strategic
weight
where
companies
such
as
microsoft
and
apple
once
battled
over
copyright
and
the
look
and
feel
of
various
technologies
today
internet
companies
use
patents
as
a
way
to
stake
out
individual
applications
and
business
models
the
most
notorious
example
being
attempt
to
patent
the
company
online
shopping
process
for
most
companies
however
software
patents
have
become
a
defensive
tool
with
deals
balancing
one
set
of
corporate
patents
against
another
in
a
tense
form
of
corporate
detente
still
in
a
few
notable
cases
of
computer
encryption
and
graphic
imaging
algorithms
software
vendors
have
successfully
stifled
rival
technologies
for
stallman
the
issue
dramatizes
the
need
for
eternal
hacker
vigilance
it
also
underlines
the
importance
of
stressing
the
political
benefits
of
free
software
programs
over
the
competitive
benefits
pointing
to
software
patents
ability
to
create
sheltered
regions
in
the
marketplace
stallman
says
competitive
performance
and
price
two
areas
where
free
software
operating
systems
such
as
and
freebsd
already
hold
a
distinct
advantage
over
their
proprietary
counterparts
are
red
herrings
compared
to
the
large
issues
of
user
and
developer
freedom
it
not
because
we
do
have
the
talent
to
make
better
software
says
stallman
it
because
we
have
the
right
somebody
has
prohibited
us
from
serving
the
public
so
what
going
to
happen
when
users
encounter
these
gaps
in
free
software
well
if
they
have
been
persuaded
by
the
open
source
movement
that
these
freedoms
are
good
because
they
lead
to
reliable
software
they
likely
to
say
did
deliver
what
you
promised
this
not
more
powerful
it
missing
this
feature
you
lied
to
me
but
if
they
have
come
to
agree
with
the
free
software
movement
that
the
freedom
is
important
in
itself
then
they
will
say
dare
those
people
stop
me
from
having
this
feature
and
my
freedom
too
and
with
that
kind
of
response
we
may
survive
the
hits
that
we
going
to
take
as
these
patents
explode
such
comments
involve
a
hefty
dose
of
spin
of
course
most
open
source
advocates
are
equally
if
not
more
vociferous
as
stallman
when
it
comes
to
opposing
software
patents
still
the
underlying
logic
of
stallman
open
source
advocates
emphasize
the
utilitarian
advantages
of
free
software
over
the
political
uncontested
rather
than
stress
the
political
significance
of
free
software
programs
open
source
advocates
have
chosen
to
stress
the
engineering
integrity
of
the
hacker
development
model
citing
the
power
of
peer
review
the
open
source
argument
paints
programs
such
as
or
freebsd
as
better
built
better
inspected
and
by
extension
more
trushworthy
to
the
average
user
that
not
to
say
the
term
open
source
does
have
its
political
implications
for
open
source
advocates
the
term
open
source
serves
two
purposes
first
it
eliminates
the
confusion
associated
with
the
word
free
a
word
many
businesses
interpret
as
meaning
zero
cost
second
it
allows
companies
to
examine
the
free
software
phenomenon
on
a
technological
rather
than
ethical
basis
eric
raymond
cofounder
of
the
open
source
initiative
and
one
of
the
leading
hackers
to
endorse
the
term
effectively
summed
up
the
frustration
of
following
stallman
down
the
political
path
in
a
essay
titled
shut
up
and
show
them
the
code
rms
rhetoric
is
very
seductive
to
the
kind
of
people
we
are
we
hackers
are
thinkers
and
idealists
who
readily
resonate
with
appeals
to
principle
and
freedom
and
rights
even
when
we
disagree
with
bits
of
his
program
we
want
rms
rhetorical
style
to
work
we
think
it
ought
to
work
we
tend
to
be
puzzled
and
disbelieving
when
it
fails
on
the
of
people
who
are
wired
like
we
included
among
that
raymond
writes
are
the
bulk
of
business
managers
investors
and
nonhacker
computer
users
who
through
sheer
weight
of
numbers
tend
to
decide
the
overall
direction
of
the
commercial
software
marketplace
without
a
way
to
win
these
people
over
raymond
argues
programmers
are
doomed
to
pursue
their
ideology
on
the
periphery
of
society
when
rms
insists
that
we
talk
about
computer
users
rights
he
issuing
a
dangerously
attractive
invitation
to
us
to
repeat
old
failures
it
one
we
should
because
his
principles
are
wrong
but
because
that
kind
of
language
applied
to
software
simply
does
not
persuade
anybody
but
us
in
fact
it
confuses
and
repels
most
people
outside
our
watching
stallman
deliver
his
political
message
in
person
it
is
hard
to
see
anything
confusing
or
repellent
stallman
appearance
may
seem
but
his
message
is
logical
when
an
audience
member
asks
if
in
shunning
proprietary
software
free
software
proponents
lose
the
ability
to
keep
up
with
the
latest
technological
advancements
stallman
answers
the
question
in
terms
of
his
own
personal
beliefs
i
think
that
freedom
is
more
important
than
mere
technical
advance
he
says
i
would
always
choose
a
less
advanced
free
program
rather
than
a
more
advanced
nonfree
program
because
i
give
up
my
freedom
for
something
like
that
my
rule
is
if
i
ca
share
it
with
you
i
wo
take
it
such
answers
however
reinforce
the
nature
of
the
stallman
message
like
a
jew
keeping
kosher
or
a
mormon
refusing
to
drink
alcohol
stallman
paints
his
decision
to
use
free
software
in
the
place
of
proprietary
in
the
color
of
tradition
and
personal
belief
as
software
evangelists
go
stallman
avoids
forcing
those
beliefs
down
listeners
throats
then
again
a
listener
rarely
leaves
a
stallman
speech
not
knowing
where
the
true
path
to
software
righteousness
lies
as
if
to
drive
home
this
message
stallman
punctuates
his
speech
with
an
unusual
ritual
pulling
a
black
robe
out
of
a
plastic
grocery
bag
stallman
puts
it
on
out
of
a
second
bag
he
pulls
a
reflective
yellow
computer
disk
and
places
it
on
his
head
the
crowd
lets
out
a
startled
laugh
i
am
ignucius
of
the
church
of
emacs
says
stallman
raising
his
right
hand
in
i
bless
your
computer
my
child

the
laughter
turns
into
applause
after
a
few
seconds
as
audience
members
clap
the
computer
disk
on
stallman
head
catches
the
glare
of
an
overhead
light
eliciting
a
perfect
halo
effect
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
stallman
goes
from
awkward
haole
to
russian
religious
emacs
was
initially
a
text
editor
says
stallman
explaining
the
getup
eventually
it
became
a
way
of
life
for
many
and
a
religion
for
some
we
call
this
religion
the
church
of
emacs
the
skit
is
a
lighthearted
moment
of
a
humorous
at
the
many
people
who
might
see
stallman
form
of
software
asceticism
as
religious
fanaticism
in
disguise
it
is
also
the
sound
of
the
other
shoe
it
as
if
in
donning
his
robe
and
halo
stallman
is
finally
letting
listeners
of
the
hook
saying
it
ok
to
laugh
i
know
i
weird
discussing
the
ignucius
persona
afterward
stallman
says
he
first
came
up
with
it
in
long
after
the
creation
of
emacs
but
well
before
the
emergence
of
the
open
source
term
and
the
struggle
for
leadership
that
precipitated
it
at
the
time
stallman
says
he
wanted
a
way
to
poke
fun
at
himself
to
remind
listeners
that
though
stubborn
stallman
was
not
the
fanatic
some
made
him
out
to
be
it
was
only
later
stallman
adds
that
others
seized
the
persona
as
a
convenient
way
to
play
up
his
reputation
as
software
ideologue
as
eric
raymond
did
in
an
interview
with
the
web
site
when
i
say
rms
calibrates
what
he
does
i
not
belittling
or
accusing
him
of
insincerity
i
saying
that
like
all
good
communicators
he
got
a
theatrical
streak
sometimes
it
you
ever
seen
him
in
his
ignucius
drag
blessing
software
with
a
disk
platter
on
his
head
mostly
it
unconscious
he
just
learned
the
degree
of
irritating
stimulus
that
works
that
holds
attention
without
usually
freaking
people
guest
interview
eric
raymond
may
http
stallman
takes
issue
with
the
raymond
analysis
simply
my
way
of
making
fun
of
myself
he
says
the
fact
that
others
see
it
as
anything
more
than
that
is
a
reflection
of
their
agenda
not
mine
that
said
stallman
does
admit
to
being
a
ham
are
you
kidding
he
says
at
one
point
i
love
being
the
center
of
attention
to
facilitate
that
process
stallman
says
he
once
enrolled
in
toastmasters
an
organization
that
helps
members
bolster
their
skills
and
one
stallman
recommends
highly
to
others
he
possesses
a
stage
presence
that
would
be
the
envy
of
most
theatrical
performers
and
feels
a
link
to
vaudevillians
of
years
past
a
few
days
after
the
maui
high
performance
computing
center
speech
i
allude
to
the
linuxworld
performace
and
ask
stallman
if
he
has
a
groucho
marx
the
unwillingness
to
belong
to
any
club
that
would
have
him
as
a
member
stallman
response
is
immediate
no
but
i
admire
groucho
marx
in
a
lot
of
ways
and
certainly
have
been
in
some
things
i
say
inspired
by
him
but
then
i
also
been
inspired
in
some
ways
by
harpo
the
groucho
marx
influence
is
certainly
evident
in
stallman
lifelong
fondness
for
punning
then
again
punning
and
wordplay
are
common
hacker
traits
perhaps
the
most
aspect
of
stallman
personality
however
is
the
deadpan
manner
in
which
the
puns
are
delivered
most
come
so
even
the
hint
of
a
raised
eyebrow
or
upturned
almost
have
to
wonder
if
stallman
laughing
at
his
audience
more
than
the
audience
is
laughing
at
him
watching
members
of
the
maui
high
performance
computer
center
laugh
at
the
ignucius
parody
such
concerns
evaporate
while
not
exactly
a
standup
act
stallman
certainly
possesses
the
chops
to
keep
a
roomful
of
engineers
in
stitches
to
be
a
saint
in
the
church
of
emacs
does
not
require
celibacy
but
it
does
require
making
a
commitment
to
living
a
life
of
moral
purity
he
tells
the
maui
audience
you
must
exorcise
the
evil
proprietary
operating
system
from
all
your
computer
and
then
install
a
wholly
holy
free
operating
system
and
then
you
must
install
only
free
software
on
top
of
that
if
you
make
this
commitment
and
live
by
it
then
you
too
will
be
a
saint
in
the
church
of
emacs
and
you
too
may
have
a
halo
the
ignucius
skit
ends
with
a
brief
inside
joke
on
most
unix
systems
and
offshoots
the
primary
competitor
program
to
emacs
is
vi
a
program
developed
by
former
uc
berkeley
student
and
current
sun
microsystems
chief
scientist
bill
joy
before
doffing
his
halo
stallman
pokes
fun
at
the
rival
program
people
sometimes
ask
me
if
it
is
a
sin
in
the
church
of
emacs
to
use
vi
he
says
using
a
free
version
of
vi
is
not
a
sin
it
is
a
penance
so
happy
hacking
after
a
brief
session
audience
members
gather
around
stallman
a
few
ask
for
autographs
i
sign
this
says
stallman
holding
up
one
woman
print
out
of
the
gnu
general
public
license
but
only
if
you
promise
me
to
use
the
term
instead
of
linux
and
tell
all
your
friends
to
do
likewise
the
comment
merely
confirms
a
private
observation
unlike
other
stage
performers
and
political
figures
stallman
has
no
off
mode
aside
from
the
ignucius
character
the
ideologue
you
see
onstage
is
the
ideologue
you
meet
backstage
later
that
evening
during
a
dinner
conversation
in
which
a
programmer
mentions
his
affinity
for
open
source
programs
stallman
between
bites
upbraids
his
tablemate
you
mean
free
software
that
the
proper
way
to
refer
to
it
during
the
session
stallman
admits
to
playing
the
pedagogue
at
times
there
are
many
people
who
say
first
let
invite
people
to
join
the
community
and
then
let
teach
them
about
freedom
and
that
could
be
a
reasonable
strategy
but
what
we
have
is
almost
everybody
inviting
people
to
join
the
community
and
hardly
anybody
teaching
them
about
freedom
once
they
come
in
the
result
stallman
says
is
something
akin
to
a
city
people
move
in
hoping
to
strike
it
rich
or
at
the
very
least
to
take
part
in
a
vibrant
open
culture
and
yet
those
who
hold
the
true
power
keep
evolving
new
tricks
and
software
keep
the
masses
out
you
have
millions
of
people
moving
in
and
building
shantytowns
but
working
on
step
two
getting
them
out
of
those
shantytowns
if
you
think
talking
about
software
freedom
is
a
good
strategy
please
join
in
doing
step
two
there
are
plenty
working
on
step
one
we
need
more
people

working
on

two
means
driving
home
the
issue
that
freedom
not
acceptance
is
the
root
issue
of
the
free
software
movement
those
who
hope
to
reform
the
proprietary
software
industry
from
the
inside
are
on
a
fool
errand
change
from
the
inside
is

how
would
you
suggest
dealing
with

espionage
well
those
two
questions
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
really
says
stallman
but
i
mean
if
someone
wants
to
steal
another
piece
of

stallman
recoils
as
if
hit

wait
a
second
stallman
says
steal
i
sorry
there
so
much
prejudice
in
that
statement
that
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
i
reject
that
prejudice
companies
that
develop
nonfree
software
and
other
things
keep
lots
and
lots
of
trade
secrets
and
so
that
not
really
likely
to
change
in
the
old
in
the
the
most
part
programmers
were
not
aware
that
there
were
even
software
patents
and
were
paying
no
attention
to
them
what
happened
was
that
people
published
the
interesting
ideas
and
if
they
were
not
in
the
free
software
movement
they
kept
secret
the
little
details
and
now
they
patent
those
broad
ideas
and
keep
secret
the
little
details
so
as
far
as
what
you
describing
patents
really
make
no
difference
to
it
one
way
or
another
but
if
it
does
affect
their
publication
a
new
audience
member
jumps
in
his
voice
trailing
off
almost
as
soon
as
he
starts
speaking
but
it
does
stallman
says
their
publication
is
telling
you
that
this
is
an
idea
that
off
limits
to
the
rest
of
the
community
for
years
and
what
the
hell
good
is
that
besides
they
written
it
in
such
a
hard
way
to
read
both
to
obfuscate
the
idea
and
to
make
the
patent
as
broad
as
possible
that
basically
useless
looking
at
the
published
information
to
learn
anything
anyway
the
only
reason
to
look
at
patents
is
to
see
the
bad
news
of
what
you
ca
do
the
audience
falls
silent
the
speech
which
began
at
is
now
nearing
the
whistle
and
most
listeners
are
already
squirming
in
their
seats
antsy
to

stallman

the
gnu
general
public
license
by
the
spring
of
richard
stallman
had
settled
on
the
gnu
project
first
free
software
version
of
emacs
to
meet
this
goal
however
he
faced
two
challenges
first
he
had
to
rebuild
emacs
in
a
way
that
made
it
platform
independent
second
he
had
to
rebuild
the
emacs
commune
in
a
similar
fashion
the
dispute
with
unipress
had
highlighted
a
flaw
in
the
emacs
commune
social
contract
where
users
relied
on
stallman
expert
insight
the
commune
rules
held
in
areas
where
stallman
no
longer
held
the
position
of
alpha
unix
systems
for
and
companies
were
free
to
make
their
own
rules
the
tension
between
the
freedom
to
modify
and
the
freedom
to
exert
authorial
privilege
had
been
building
before
gosmacs
the
copyright
act
of
had
overhauled
copyright
law
extending
the
legal
protection
of
copyright
to
software
programs
according
to
section
b
of
the
act
individuals
and
companies
now
possessed
the
ability
to
copyright
the
expression
of
a
software
program
but
not
the
actual
processes
or
methods
embodied
in
the
program
see
hal
abelson
mike
fischer
and
joanne
costello
software
and
copyright
law
updated
version
translated
programmers
and
companies
had
the
ability
to
treat
software
programs
like
a
story
or
song
other
programmers
could
take
inspiration
from
the
work
but
to
make
a
direct
copy
or
nonsatirical
derivative
they
first
had
to
secure
permission
from
the
original
creator
although
the
new
law
guaranteed
that
even
programs
without
copyright
notices
carried
copyright
protection
programmers
quickly
asserted
their
rights
attaching
coypright
notices
to
their
software
programs
at
first
stallman
viewed
these
notices
with
alarm
rare
was
the
software
program
that
did
borrow
source
code
from
past
programs
and
yet
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
president
pen
congress
had
given
programmers
and
companies
the
power
to
assert
individual
authorship
over
communally
built
programs
it
also
injected
a
dose
of
formality
into
what
had
otherwise
been
an
informal
system
even
if
hackers
could
demonstrate
how
a
given
program
bloodlines
stretched
back
years
if
not
decades
the
resources
and
money
that
went
into
battling
each
copyright
notice
were
beyond
most
hackers
means
simply
put
disputes
that
had
once
been
settled
were
now
settled
in
such
a
system
companies
not
hackers
held
the
automatic
advantage
proponents
of
software
copyright
had
their
without
copyright
works
might
otherwise
slip
into
the
public
domain
putting
a
copyright
notice
on
a
work
also
served
as
a
statement
of
quality
programmers
or
companies
who
attached
their
name
to
the
copyright
attached
their
reputations
as
well
finally
it
was
a
contract
as
well
as
a
statement
of
ownership
using
copyright
as
a
flexible
form
of
license
an
author
could
give
away
certain
rights
in
exchange
for
certain
forms
of
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
user
for
example
an
author
could
give
away
the
right
to
suppress
unauthorized
copies
just
so
long
as
the
end
user
agreed
not
to
create
a
commercial
offshoot
it
was
this
last
argument
that
eventually
softened
stallman
resistance
to
software
copyright
notices
looking
back
on
the
years
leading
up
to
the
gnu
project
stallman
says
he
began
to
sense
the
beneficial
nature
of
copyright
sometime
around
the
release
of
emacs
the
last
significant
project
upgrade
of
emacs
i
had
seen
email
messages
with
copyright
notices
plus
simple
copying
permitted
licenses
stallman
recalls
those
definitely
were
an
inspiration
for
emacs
stallman
drafted
a
copyright
that
gave
users
the
right
to
make
and
distribute
copies
it
also
gave
users
the
right
to
make
modified
versions
but
not
the
right
to
claim
sole
ownership
of
those
modified
versions
as
in
the
case
of
gosmacs
although
helpful
in
codifying
the
social
contract
of
the
emacs
commune
the
emacs
license
remained
too
informal
for
the
purposes
of
the
gnu
project
stallman
says
soon
after
starting
work
on
a
gnu
version
of
emacs
stallman
began
consulting
with
the
other
members
of
the
free
software
foundation
on
how
to
shore
up
the
license
language
he
also
consulted
with
the
attorneys
who
had
helped
him
set
up
the
free
software
foundation
mark
fischer
a
boston
attorney
specializing
in
law
recalls
discussing
the
license
with
stallman
during
this
period
richard
had
very
strong
views
about
how
it
should
work
fischer
says
he
had
two
principles
the
first
was
to
make
the
software
absolutely
as
open
as
possible
the
second
was
to
encourage
others
to
adopt
the
same
licensing
practices
encouraging
others
to
adopt
the
same
licensing
practices
meant
closing
off
the
escape
hatch
that
had
allowed
privately
owned
versions
of
emacs
to
emerge
to
close
that
escape
hatch
stallman
and
his
free
software
colleagues
came
up
with
a
solution
users
would
be
free
to
modify
gnu
emacs
just
so
long
as
they
published
their
modifications
in
addition
the
resulting
derivative
works
would
also
have
carry
the
same
gnu
emacs
license
the
revolutionary
nature
of
this
final
condition
would
take
a
while
to
sink
in
at
the
time
fischer
says
he
simply
viewed
the
gnu
emacs
license
as
a
simple
contract
it
put
a
price
tag
on
gnu
emacs
use
instead
of
money
stallman
was
charging
users
access
to
their
own
later
modifications
that
said
fischer
does
remember
the
contract
terms
as
unique
i
think
asking
other
people
to
accept
the
price
was
if
not
unique
highly
unusual
at
that
time
he
says
the
gnu
emacs
license
made
its
debut
when
stallman
finally
released
gnu
emacs
in
following
the
release
stallman
welcomed
input
from
the
general
hacker
community
on
how
to
improve
the
language
one
hacker
to
take
up
the
offer
was
future
software
activist
john
gilmore
then
working
as
a
consultant
to
sun
microsystems
as
part
of
his
consulting
work
gilmore
had
ported
emacs
over
to
sunos
the
company
version
of
unix
in
the
process
of
doing
so
gilmore
had
published
the
changes
as
per
the
demands
of
the
gnu
emacs
license
instead
of
viewing
the
license
as
a
liability
gilmore
saw
it
as
clear
and
concise
expression
of
the
hacker
ethos
up
until
then
most
licenses
were
very
informal
gilmore
recalls
as
an
example
of
this
informality
gilmore
cites
a
copyright
notice
for
trn
a
unix
utility
written
by
larry
wall
future
creator
of
the
perl
programming
language
patch
made
it
simple
for
unix
programmers
to
insert
patches
in
hacker
any
large
program
recognizing
the
utility
of
this
feature
wall
put
the
following
copyright
notice
in
the
program
accompanying
readme
file
copyright
c
larry
wall
you
may
copy
the
trn
kit
in
whole
or
in
part
as
long
as
you
do
try
to
make
money
off
it
or
pretend
that
you
wrote
trn
kit
readme
http
such
statements
while
reflective
of
the
hacker
ethic
also
reflected
the
difficulty
of
translating
the
loose
informal
nature
of
that
ethic
into
the
rigid
legal
language
of
copyright
in
writing
the
gnu
emacs
license
stallman
had
done
more
than
close
up
the
escape
hatch
that
permitted
proprietary
offshoots
he
had
expressed
the
hacker
ethic
in
a
manner
understandable
to
both
lawyer
and
hacker
alike
it
was
long
gilmore
says
before
other
hackers
began
discussing
ways
to
port
the
gnu
emacs
license
over
to
their
own
programs
prompted
by
a
conversation
on
usenet
gilmore
sent
an
email
to
stallman
in
november
suggesting
modification
you
should
probably
remove
emacs
from
the
license
and
replace
it
with
software
or
something
soon
we
hope
emacs
will
not
be
the
biggest
part
of
the
gnu
system
and
the
license
applies
to
all
of
john
gilmore
quoted
from
email
to
author
gilmore
was
the
only
person
suggesting
a
more
general
approach
by
the
end
of
stallman
himself
was
at
work
with
gnu
project
next
major
milestone
a
debugger
and
was
looking
for
ways
to
revamp
the
emacs
license
so
that
it
might
apply
to
both
programs
solution
remove
all
specific
references
to
emacs
and
convert
the
license
into
a
generic
copyright
umbrella
for
gnu
project
software
the
gnu
general
public
license
gpl
for
short
was
born
in
fashioning
the
gpl
stallman
followed
the
software
convention
of
using
decimal
numbers
to
indicate
prototype
versions
and
whole
numbers
to
indicate
mature
versions
stallman
published
version
of
the
gpl
in
a
project
stallman
was
developing
in
almost
a
full
year
after
the
release
of
the
gnu
debugger
stallman
second
major
foray
into
the
realm
of
unix
programming
the
license
contained
a
preamble
spelling
out
its
political
intentions
the
general
public
license
is
designed
to
make
sure
that
you
have
the
freedom
to
give
away
or
sell
copies
of
free
software
that
you
receive
source
code
or
can
get
it
if
you
want
it
that
you
can
change
the
software
or
use
pieces
of
it
in
new
free
programs
and
that
you
know
you
can
do
these
things
to
protect
your
rights
we
need
to
make
restrictions
that
forbid
anyone
to
deny
you
these
rights
or
to
ask
you
to
surrender
the
rights
these
restrictions
translate
to
certain
responsibilities
for
you
if
you
distribute
copies
of
the
software
or
if
you

richard
stallman
et
gnu
general
public
license
version
february
http
in
fashioning
the
gpl
stallman
had
been
forced
to
make
an
additional
adjustment
to
the
informal
tenets
of
the
old
emacs
commune
where
he
had
once
demanded
that
commune
members
publish
any
and
all
changes
stallman
now
demanded
publication
only
in
instances
when
programmers
circulated
their
derivative
versions
in
the
same
public
manner
as
stallman
in
other
words
programmers
who
simply
modified
emacs
for
private
use
no
longer
needed
to
send
the
changes
back
to
stallman
in
what
would
become
a
rare
compromise
of
free
software
doctrine
stallman
slashed
the
price
tag
for
free
software
users
could
innovate
without
stallman
looking
over
their
shoulders
just
so
long
as
they
did
bar
stallman
and
the
rest
of
the
hacker
community
from
future
exchanges
of
the
same
program
looking
back
stallman
says
the
gpl
compromise
was
fueled
by
his
own
dissatisfaction
with
the
big
brother
aspect
of
the
original
emacs
commune
social
contract
as
much
as
he
liked
peering
into
other
systems
the
knowledge
that
some
future
maintainer
might
use
that
power
to
ill
effect
forced
him
to
temper
the
gpl
it
was
wrong
to
require
people
to
publish
all
changes
says
stallman
it
was
wrong
to
require
them
to
be
sent
to
one
privileged
developer
that
kind
of
centralization
and
privilege
for
one
was
not
consistent
with
a
society
in
which
all
had
equal
rights
as
hacks
go
the
gpl
stands
as
one
of
stallman
best
it
created
a
system
of
communal
ownership
within
the
normally
proprietary
confines
of
copyright
law
more
importantly
it
demonstrated
the
intellectual
similarity
between
legal
code
and
software
code
implicit
within
the
gpl
preamble
was
a
profound
message
instead
of
viewing
copyright
law
with
suspicion
hackers
should
view
it
as
yet
another
system
begging
to
be
hacked
the
gpl
developed
much
like
any
piece
of
free
software
with
a
large
community
discussing
its
structure
its
respect
or
the
opposite
in
their
observation
needs
for
tweaking
and
even
to
compromise
it
mildly
for
greater
acceptance
says
jerry
cohen
another
attorney
who
helped
stallman
with
the
creation
of
the
license
the
process
worked
very
well
and
gpl
in
its
several
versions
has
gone
from
widespread
skeptical
and
at
times
hostile
response
to
widespread
acceptance
in
a
interview
with
byte
magazine
stallman
summed
up
the
gpl
in
colorful
terms
in
addition
to
proclaiming
hacker
values
stallman
said
readers
should
also
see
it
as
a
form
of
intellectual
jujitsu
using
the
legal
system
that
software
hoarders
have
set
up
against
them

an
interesting
not

candid
glimpse
at
stallman
political
attitudes
during
the
earliest
days
of
the
gnu
project
it
is
also
helpful
in
tracing
the
evolution
of
stallman
rhetoric
describing
the
purpose
of
the
gpl
stallman
says
trying
to
change
the
way
people
approach
knowledge
and
information
in
general
i
think
that
to
try
to
own
knowledge
to
try
to
control
whether
people
are
allowed
to
use
it
or
to
try
to
stop
other
people
from
sharing
it
is
sabotage
contrast
this
with
a
statement
to
the
author
in
august
i
urge
you
not
to
use
the
term
property
in
your
thinking
it
will
lead
you
to
misunderstand
things
because
that
term
generalizes
about
copyrights
patents
and
trademarks
and
those
things
are
so
different
in
their
effects
that
it
is
entirely
foolish
to
try
to
talk
about
them
at
once
if
you
hear
somebody
saying
something
about
intellectual
property
without
quotes
then
he
not
thinking
very
clearly
and
you
should
join
years
later
stallman
would
describe
the
gpl
creation
in
less
hostile
terms
i
was
thinking
about
issues
that
were
in
a
sense
ethical
and
in
a
sense
political
and
in
a
sense
legal
he
says
i
had
to
try
to
do
what
could
be
sustained
by
the
legal
system
that
in
in
spirit
the
job
was
that
of
legislating
the
basis
for
a
new
society
but
since
i
was
a
government
i
could
actually
change
any
laws
i
had
to
try
to
do
this
by
building
on
top
of
the
existing
legal
system
which
had
not
been
designed
for
anything
like
this
about
the
time
stallman
was
pondering
the
ethical
political
and
legal
issues
associated
with
free
software
a
california
hacker
named
don
hopkins
mailed
him
a
manual
for
the
microprocessor
hopkins
a
unix
hacker
and
fellow
buff
had
borrowed
the
manual
from
stallman
a
while
earlier
as
a
display
of
gratitude
hopkins
decorated
the
return
envelope
with
a
number
of
stickers
obtained
at
a
local
convention
one
sticker
in
particular
caught
stallman
eye
it
read
copyleft
l
all
rights
reversed
following
the
release
of
the
first
version
of
gpl
stallman
paid
tribute
to
the
sticker
nicknaming
the
free
software
license
copyleft
over
time
the
nickname
and
its
shorthand
symbol
a
backwards
c
would
become
an
official
free
software
foundation
synonym
for
the
gpl
the
german
sociologist
max
weber
once
proposed
that
all
great
religions
are
built
upon
the
routinization
or
institutionalization
of
charisma
every
successful
religion
weber
argued
converts
the
charisma
or
message
of
the
original
religious
leader
into
a
social
political
and
ethical
apparatus
more
easily
translatable
across
cultures
and
time
while
not
religious
per
se
the
gnu
gpl
certainly
qualifies
as
an
interesting
example
of
this
routinization
process
at
work
in
the
modern
decentralized
world
of
software
development
since
its
unveiling
programmers
and
companies
who
have
otherwise
expressed
little
loyalty
or
allegiance
to
stallman
have
willingly
accepted
the
gpl
bargain
at
face
value
a
few
have
even
accepted
the
gpl
as
a
preemptive
protective
mechanism
for
their
own
software
programs
even
those
who
reject
the
gpl
contract
as
too
compulsory
still
credit
it
as
influential
one
hacker
falling
into
this
latter
group
was
keith
bostic
a
university
of
california
employee
at
the
time
of
the
gpl
release
bostic
department
the
computer
systems
research
group
srg
had
been
involved
in
unix
development
since
the
late
and
was
responsible
for
many
key
parts
of
unix
including
the
networking
protocol
the
cornerstone
of
modern
internet
communications
by
the
late
at
t
the
original
owner
of
the
unix
brand
name
began
to
focus
on
commercializing
unix
and
began
looking
to
the
berkeley
software
distribution
or
bsd
the
academic
version
of
unix
developed
by
bostic
and
his
berkeley
peers
as
a
key
source
of
commercial
technology
although
the
berkeley
bsd
source
code
was
shared
among
researchers
and
commercial
programmers
with
a
license
this
commercialization
presented
a
problem
the
berkeley
code
was
intermixed
with
proprietary
at
t
code
as
a
result
berkeley
distributions
were
available
only
to
institutions
that
already
had
a
unix
source
license
from
at
t
as
at
t
raised
its
license
fees
this
arrangement
which
had
at
first
seemed
innocuous
became
increasingly
burdensome
hired
in
bostic
had
taken
on
the
personal
project
of
porting
bsd
over
to
the
digital
equipment
corporation
computer
it
was
during
this
period
bostic
says
that
he
came
into
close
interaction
with
stallman
during
stallman
occasional
forays
out
to
the
west
coast
i
remember
vividly
arguing
copyright
with
stallman
while
he
sat
at
borrowed
workstations
at
csrg
says
bostic
we
go
to
dinner
afterward
and
continue
arguing
about
copyright
over
dinner
the
arguments
eventually
took
hold
although
not
in
the
way
stallman
would
have
liked
in
june
berkeley
separated
its
networking
code
from
the
rest
of
the
at
operating
system
and
distributed
it
under
a
university
of
california
license
the
contract
terms
were
liberal
all
a
licensee
had
to
do
was
give
credit
to
the
university
in
advertisements
touting
derivative
university
of
california
obnoxious
advertising
clause
would
later
prove
to
be
a
problem
looking
for
a
less
restrictive
alternative
to
the
gpl
some
hackers
used
the
university
of
california
replacing
university
of
california
with
the
name
of
their
own
instution
the
result
free
software
programs
that
borrowed
from
dozens
of
other
programs
would
have
to
cite
dozens
of
institutions
in
advertisements
in
after
a
decade
of
lobbying
on
stallman
part
the
university
of
california
agreed
to
drop
this
clause
in
contrast
to
the
gpl
proprietary
offshoots
were
permissible
only
one
problem
hampered
the
rapid
adoption
the
bsd
networking
release
was
a
complete
operating
system
people
could
study
the
code
but
it
could
only
be
run
in
conjunction
with
other
code
over
the
next
few
years
bostic
and
other
university
of
california
employees
worked
to
replace
the
missing
components
and
turn
bsd
into
a
complete
freely
redistributable
operating
system
although
delayed
by
a
legal
challenge
from
unix
systems
at
t
that
retained
ownership
of
the
unix
brand
effort
would
finally
bear
fruit
in
the
early
even
before
then
however
many
of
the
berkeley
utilities
would
make
their
way
into
stallman
gnu
project
i
think
it
highly
unlikely
that
we
ever
would
have
gone
as
strongly
as
we
did
without
the
gnu
influence
says
bostic
looking
back
it
was
clearly
something
where
they
were
pushing
hard
and
we
liked
the
idea
by
the
end
of
the
the
gpl
was
beginning
to
exert
a
gravitational
effect
on
the
free
software
community
a
program
did
have
to
carry
the
gpl
to
qualify
as
free
the
case
of
the
bsd
putting
a
program
under
the
gpl
sent
a
definite
message
i
think
the
very
existence
of
the
gpl
inspired
people
to
think
through
whether
they
were
making
free
software
and
how
they
would
license
it
says
bruce
perens
creator
of
electric
fence
a
popular
unix
utility
and
future
leader
of
the
debian
development
team
a
few
years
after
the
release
of
the
gpl
perens
says
he
decided
to
discard
electric
homegrown
license
in
favor
of
stallman
copyright
it
was
actually
pretty
easy
to
do
perens
recalls
rich
morin
the
programmer
who
had
viewed
initial
gnu
announcement
with
a
degree
of
skepticism
recalls
being
impressed
by
the
software
that
began
to
gather
under
the
gpl
umbrella
as
the
leader
of
a
sunos
user
group
one
of
morin
primary
duties
during
the
had
been
to
send
out
distribution
tapes
containing
the
best
freeware
or
free
software
utilities
the
job
often
mandated
calling
up
original
program
authors
to
verify
whether
their
programs
were
copyright
protected
or
whether
they
had
been
consigned
to
the
public
domain
around
morin
says
he
began
to
notice
that
the
best
software
programs
typically
fell
under
the
gpl
license
as
a
software
distributor
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
word
gpl
i
knew
i
was
home
free
recalls
morin
to
compensate
for
the
prior
hassles
that
went
into
compiling
distribution
tapes
to
the
sun
user
group
morin
had
charged
recipients
a
convenience
fee
now
with
programs
moving
over
to
the
gpl
morin
was
suddenly
getting
his
tapes
put
together
in
half
the
time
turning
a
tidy
profit
in
the
process
sensing
a
commercial
opportunity
morin
rechristened
his
hobby
as
a
business
prime
time
freeware
such
commercial
exploitation
was
completely
within
the
confines
of
the
free
software
agenda
when
we
speak
of
free
software
we
are
referring
to
freedom
not
price
advised
stallman
in
the
gpl
preamble
by
the
late
stallman
had
refined
it
to
a
more
simple
mnemonic
do
think
free
as
in
free
beer
think
free
as
in
free
speech
for
the
most
part
businesses
ignored
entreaties
still
for
a
few
entrepreneurs
the
freedom
associated
with
free
software
was
the
same
freedom
associated
with
free
markets
take
software
ownership
out
of
the
commercial
equation
and
you
had
a
situation
where
even
the
smallest
software
company
was
free
to
compete
against
the
ibms
and
decs
of
the
world
one
of
the
first
entrepreneurs
to
grasp
this
concept
was
michael
tiemann
a
software
programmer
and
graduate
student
at
stanford
university
during
the
tiemann
had
followed
the
gnu
project
like
an
aspiring
jazz
musician
following
a
favorite
artist
it
until
the
release
of
the
gnu
c
compiler
in
however
that
he
began
to
grasp
the
full
potential
of
free
software
dubbing
gcc
a
bombshell
tiemann
says
the
program
own
existence
underlined
determination
as
a
programmer
just
as
every
writer
dreams
of
writing
the
great
american
novel
every
programmer
back
in
the
talked
about
writing
the
great
american
compiler
tiemman
recalls
suddenly
stallman
had
done
it
it
was
very
humbling
you
talk
about
single
points
of
failure
gcc
was
it
echoes
bostic
nobody
had
a
compiler
back
then
until
gcc
came
along
rather
than
compete
with
stallman
tiemann
decided
to
build
on
top
of
his
work
the
original
version
of
gcc
weighed
in
at
lines
of
code
but
tiemann
recalls
the
program
as
surprisingly
easy
to
understand
so
easy
in
fact
that
tiemann
says
it
took
less
than
five
days
to
master
and
another
week
to
port
the
software
to
a
new
hardware
platform
national
semiconductor
microchip
over
the
next
year
tiemann
began
playing
around
with
the
source
code
creating
a
native
compiler
for
the
programming
language
one
day
while
delivering
a
lecture
on
the
program
at
bell
labs
tiemann
ran
into
some
at
t
developers
struggling
to
pull
off
the
same
thing
there
were
about
or
people
in
the
room
and
i
asked
how
many
people
were
working
on
the
native
code
compiler
tiemann
recalls
my
host
said
the
information
was
confidential
but
added
that
if
i
took
a
look
around
the
room
i
might
get
a
good
general
idea
it
was
long
after
tiemann
says
that
the
light
bulb
went
off
in
his
head
i
had
been
working
on
that
project
for
six
months
tiemann
says
i
just
thought
to
myself
whether
it
me
or
the
code
this
is
a
level
of
efficiency
that
the
free
market
should
be
ready
to
reward
tiemann
found
added
inspiration
in
the
gnu
manifesto
which
while
excoriating
the
greed
of
some
software
vendors
encourages
other
vendors
to
consider
the
advantages
of
free
software
from
a
consumer
point
of
view
by
removing
the
power
of
monopoly
from
the
commerical
software
question
the
gpl
makes
it
possible
for
the
smartest
vendors
to
compete
on
the
basis
of
service
and
consulting
the
two
most
corners
of
the
software
marketplace
in
a
essay
tiemann
recalls
the
impact
of
stallman
manifesto
it
read
like
a
socialist
polemic
but
i
saw
something
different
i
saw
a
business
plan
in
see
michael
tiemann
future
of
cygnus
solutions
an
entrepreneur
account
open
sources
associates
teaming
up
with
john
gilmore
another
gnu
project
fan
tiemann
launched
a
software
consulting
service
dedicated
to
customizing
gnu
programs
dubbed
cygnus
support
the
company
signed
its
first
development
contract
in
february
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
company
had
worth
of
support
and
development
contracts
gnu
emacs
gdb
and
gcc
were
the
big
three
of
tools
but
they
were
the
only
ones
developed
by
stallman
during
the
gnu
first
half
decade
by
stallman
had
also
generated
gnu
versions
of
the
bourne
shell
rechristened
the
bourne
again
shell
or
bash
yacc
rechristened
bison
and
awk
rechristened
gawk
like
gcc
every
gnu
program
had
to
be
designed
to
run
on
multiple
systems
not
just
a
single
vendor
platform
in
the
process
of
making
programs
more
flexible
stallman
and
his
collaborators
often
made
them
more
useful
as
well
recalling
the
gnu
universalist
approach
prime
time
freeware
morin
points
to
a
critical
albeit
mundane
software
package
called
hello
it
the
hello
world
program
which
is
five
lines
of
c
packaged
up
as
if
it
were
a
gnu
distribution
morin
says
and
so
it
got
the
texinfo
stuff
and
the
configure
stuff
it
got
all
the
other
software
engineering
goo
that
the
gnu
project
has
come
up
with
to
allow
packages
to
port
to
all
these
different
environments
smoothly
that
tremendously
important
work
and
it
affects
not
only
all
of
stallman
software
but
also
all
of
the
other
gnu
project
software
according
to
stallman
improving
software
programs
was
secondary
to
building
them
in
the
first
place
with
each
piece
i
may
or
may
not
find
a
way
to
improve
it
said
stallman
to
byte
to
some
extent
i
am
getting
the
benefit
of
reimplementation
which
makes
many
systems
much
better
to
some
extent
it
because
i
have
been
in
the
field
a
long
time
and
worked
on
many
other
systems
i
therefore
have
many
ideas
to
bring
to
bear
see
richard
stallman
byte
nevertheless
as
gnu
tools
made
their
mark
in
the
late
stallman
ai
reputation
for
design
fastidiousness
soon
became
legendary
throughout
the
entire
community
jeremy
allison
a
sun
user
during
the
late
and
programmer
destined
to
run
his
own
free
software
project
samba
in
the
recalls
that
reputation
with
a
laugh
during
the
late
allison
began
using
emacs
inspired
by
the
model
allison
says
he
sent
in
a
snippet
of
source
code
only
to
have
it
rejected
by
stallman
it
was
like
the
onion
headline
allison
says
prayers
to
god
answered
no
stallman
growing
stature
as
a
software
programmer
however
was
balanced
by
his
struggles
as
a
project
manager
although
the
gnu
project
moved
from
success
to
success
in
creation
of
tools
its
inability
to
generate
a
working
central
traffic
cop
program
in
all
unix
systems
that
determines
which
devices
and
applications
get
access
to
the
microprocessor
and
starting
to
elicit
grumbles
as
the
came
to
a
close
as
with
most
gnu
project
efforts
stallman
had
started
kernel
development
by
looking
for
an
existing
program
to
modify
according
to
a
january
gnusletter
stallman
was
already
working
to
overhaul
trix
a
unix
kernel
developed
at

a
review
of
gnu

gnusletters
of
the
late
reflects
the
management
tension
in
january
stallman
announced
to
the
world
that
the
gnu
project
was
working
to
overhaul
trix
a
unix
kernel
developed
at
mit
a
year
later
in
february
of
the
gnu

announced

told

kernel
development
would
commence
until

http
the
delays
in
kernel
development
were
just
one
of
many
concerns
weighing
on
stallman
during
this
period
in
lotus
development
corporation
filed
suit
against
rival
software
company
paperback
software
international
for
copying

in

lotus
suit
coupled
with
the
apple
look
and
feel
battle
provided
a
troublesome
backdrop
for
the
gnu
project
although
both
suits
fell
outside
the
scope
of
the
gnu
project
both
revolved
around
operating
systems
and
software
applications
developed
for
the
personal
computer
not
hardware
threatened
to
impose
a
chilling
effect
on
the
entire
culture
of
software
development
determined
to
do
something
stallman
recruited
a
few
programmer
friends
and
composed
a
magazine
ad
blasting
the
lawsuits
he
then
followed
up
the
ad
by
helping
to
organize
a
group
to
protest
the
corporations
filing
the
suit
calling
itself
the
league
of

freedom
the
group
held
protests

were

the

quietly
replaced
operating
systems
as
the
primary
corporate
battleground
in
its
unfulfilled
quest
to
build
a
free
software
operating
system
the
gnu
project
seemed
hopelessly
behind
the
times
indeed
the
very
fact
that
stallman
had
felt
it
necessary
to
put
together
an
entirely
new
group
dedicated
to
battling
the
look

reinforced
that
obsolescence

status
when
it
granted
stallman
a
macarthur
fellowship
therefore
making
him
a
recipient
for
the
organization
genius
grant
the
grant
a
reward
for
launching
the
gnu
project
and
giving
voice
to
the
free
software
philosophy
relieved
a
number
of
concerns
first
and
foremost
it
gave
stallman
a
nonsalaried
employee
of
the
fsf
who
had
been
supporting
himself
through
consulting
contracts
the
ability
to
devote
more
time
to
writing
gnu
use
the
term
writing
here
loosely
about
the
time
of
the
macarthur
award
stallman
began
suffering
chronic
pain
in
his
hands
and
was
dictating
his
work
to
typists
although
some
have
speculated
that
the
hand
pain
was
the
result
of
repetitive
stress
injury
or
rsi
an
injury
common
among
software
programmers
stallman
is
not
sure
it
was
not
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
he
writes
my
hand
problem
was
in
the
hands
themselves
not
in
the
wrists
stallman
has
since
learned
to
work
without
typists
after
switching
to
a
keyboard
with
a
lighter
touch
ironically
the
award
also
made
it
possible
for
stallman
to
vote
months
before
the
award
a
fire
in
stallman
apartment
house
had
consumed
his
few
earthly
possessions
by
the
time
of
the
award
stallman
was
listing
himself
as

stallman
would
later
recall
a
newspaper
article
about
the

said
that
and
then
they
let
me
register

most
importantly
the
macarthur
money
gave
stallman
more
freedom
already
dedicated
to
the
issue
of
software
freedom
stallman
chose
to
use
the
additional
freedom
to
increase
his
travels
in
support
of
the
gnu
project
mission
interestingly
the
ultimate
success
of
the
gnu
project
and
the
free
software
movement
in
general
would
stem
from
one
of
these
trips
in
stallman
paid
a
visit
to
the
polytechnic
university
in
helsinki
finland
among
the
audience
members
was
linus
torvalds
future
developer
of
the
linux
free
software
kernel
destined
to
fill
the
gnu
project
most
sizable
gap
a
student
at
the
nearby
university
of
helsinki
at
the
time
torvalds
regarded
stallman
with
bemusement
i
saw
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
stereotypical
bearded
hacker
type
recalls
torvalds
in
his
autobiography
just
for
fun
we
do
have
much
of
them
in
helsinki
see
linus
torvalds
and
david
diamond
just
for
fun
the
story
of
an
accidentaly
revolutionary
harpercollins
publishers
while
not
exactly
attuned
to
the
sociopolitical
side
of
the
stallman
agenda
torvalds
nevertheless
appreciated
the
agenda
underlying
logic
no
programmer
writes
code
by
sharing
software
hackers
put
a
program
improvement
ahead
of
individual
motivations
such
as
greed
or
ego
protection
like
many
programmers
of
his
generation
torvalds
had
cut
his
teeth
not
on
mainframe
computers
like
the
ibm
but
on
a
motley
assortment
of
computer
systems
as
university
student
torvalds
had
made
the
step
up
from
c
programming
to
unix
using
the
university
microvax
this
progression
had
given
torvalds
a
different
perspective
on
the
barriers
to
machine
access
for
stallman
the
chief
barriers
were
bureaucracy
and
privilege
for
torvalds
the
chief
barriers
were
geography
and
the
harsh
helsinki
winter
forced
to
trek
across
the
university
of
helsinki
just
to
log
in
to
his
unix
account
torvalds
quickly
began
looking
for
a
way
to
log
in
from
the
warm
confines
of
his
apartment
the
search
led
torvalds
to
the
operating
system
minix
a
lightweight
version
of
unix
developed
for
instructional
purposes
by
dutch
university
professor
andrew
tanenbaum
the
program
fit
within
the
memory
confines
of
a
pc
the
most
powerful
machine
torvalds
could
afford
but
still
lacked
a
few
necessary
features
it
most
notably
lacked
terminal
emulation
the
feature
that
allowed
torvalds
machine
to
mimic
a
university
terminal
making
it
possible
to
log
in
to
the
microvax
from
home
during
the
summer
of
torvalds
rewrote
minix
from
the
ground
up
adding
other
features
as
he
did
so
by
the
end
of
the
summer
torvalds
was
referring
to
his
evolving
work
as
the
of
terminal
emulation
programs
see
linus
torvalds
and
david
diamond
just
for
fun
the
story
of
an
accidentaly
revolutionary
harpercollins
publishers
feeling
confident
he
solicited
a
minix
newsgroup
for
copies
of
the
posix
standards
the
software
blue
prints
that
determined
whether
a
program
was
unix
compatible
a
few
weeks
later
torvalds
was
posting
a
message
eerily
reminiscent
of
stallman
original
gnu
posting
hello
everybody
out
there
using
i
doing
a
free
operating
system
just
a
hobby
wo
be
big
and
professional
like
gnu
for
at
clones
this
has
been
brewing
since
april
and
is
starting
to
get
ready
i
like
any
feedback
on
things
people
in
minix
as
my
os
resembles
it
somewhat
same
physical
layout
of
the

to
practical
reasons
among
other
things
linux
anniversary
http
the
posting
drew
a
smattering
of
responses
and
within
a
month
torvalds
had
posted
a
version
of
the
operating
the
earliest
possible
version
fit
for
outside
an
internet
ftp
site
in
the
course
of
doing
so
torvalds
had
to
come
up
with
a
name
for
the
new
system
on
his
own
pc
hard
drive
torvalds
had
saved
the
program
as
linux
a
name
that
paid
its
respects
to
the
software
convention
of
giving
each
unix
variant
a
name
that
ended
with
the
letter
deeming
the
name
too
egotistical
torvalds
changed
it
to
freax
only
to
have
the
ftp
site
manager
change
it
back
although
torvalds
had
set
out
build
a
full
operating
system
both
he
and
other
developers
knew
at
the
time
that
most
of
the
functional
tools
needed
to
do
so
were
already
available
thanks
to
the
work
of
gnu
bsd
and
other
free
software
developers
one
of
the
first
tools
the
linux
development
team
took
advantage
of
was
the
gnu
c
compiler
a
tool
that
made
it
possible
to
process
programs
written
in
the
c
programming
language
integrating
gcc
improved
the
performance
of
linux
it
also
raised
issues
although
the
gpl
viral
powers
did
apply
to
the
linux
kernel
torvald
willingness
to
borrow
gcc
for
the
purposes
of
his
own
free
software
operating
system
indicated
a
certain
obligation
to
let
other
users
borrow
back
as
torvalds
would
later
put
it
i
had
hoisted
myself
up
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
see
linus
torvalds
and
david
diamond
just
for
fun
the
story
of
an
accidentaly
revolutionary
harpercollins
publishers
not
surprisingly
he
began
to
think
about
what
would
happen
when
other
people
looked
to
him
for
similar
support
a
decade
after
the
decision
torvalds
echoes
the
free
software
foundation
robert
chassel
when
he
sums
up
his
thoughts
at
the
time
you
put
six
months
of
your
life
into
this
thing
and
you
want
to
make
it
available
and
you
want
to
get
something
out
of
it
but
you
do
want
people
to
take
advantage
of
it
i
wanted
people
to
be
able
to
see
linux
and
to
make
changes
and
improvements
to
their
hearts
content
but
i
also
wanted
to
make
sure
that
what
i
got
out
of
it
was
to
see
what
they
were
doing
i
wanted
to
always
have
access
to
the
sources
so
that
if
they
made
improvements
i
could
make
those
improvements
linus

and
david

just
for
fun
the
story
of
an
accidentaly
revolutionary
harpercollins
publishers
when
it
was
time
to
release
the
version
of
linux
the
first
to
include
a
fully
integrated
version
of
gcc
torvalds
decided
to
voice
his
allegiance
with
the
free
software
movement
he
discarded
the
old
kernel
license
and
replaced
it
with
the
gpl
the
decision
triggered
a
porting
spree
as
torvalds
and
his
collaborators
looked
to
other
gnu
programs
to
fold
into
the
growing
linux
stew
within
three
years
linux
developers
were
offering
their
first
production
release
linux
including
fully
modified
versions
of
gcc
gdb
and
a
host
of
bsd
tools
by
the
amalgamated
operating
system
had
earned
enough
respect
in
the
hacker
world
to
make
some
observers
wonder
if
torvalds
had
given
away
the
farm
by
switching
to
the
gpl
in
the
project
initial
months
in
the
first
issue
of
linux
journal
publisher
robert
young
sat
down
with
torvalds
for
an
interview
when
young
asked
the
finnish
programmer
if
he
felt
regret
at
giving
up
private
ownership
of
the
linux
source
code
torvalds
said
no
even
with
hindsight
torvalds
said
he
considered
the
gpl
one
of
the
very
best
design
decisions
made
during
the
early
stages
of
the
linux
robert
young
interview
with
linus
the
author
of
linux
linux
journal
march
http
that
the
decision
had
been
made
with
zero
appeal
or
deference
to
stallman
and
the
free
software
foundation
speaks
to
the
gpl
growing
portability
although
it
would
take
a
few
years
to
be
recognized
by
stallman
the
explosiveness
of
linux
development
conjured
flashbacks
of
emacs
this
time
around
however
the
innovation
triggering
the
explosion
was
a
software
hack
like
but
the
novelty
of
running
a
system
on
the
pc
architecture
the
motives
may
have
been
different
but
the
end
result
certainly
fit
the
ethical
specifications
a
fully
functional
operating
system
composed
entirely
of
free
software
as
his
initial
email
message
to
the
newsgroup
indicates
it
would
take
a
few
months
before
torvalds
saw
linux
as
anything
less
than
a
holdover
until
the
gnu
developers
delivered
on
the
hurd
kernel
this
initial
unwillingness
to
see
linux
in
political
terms
would
represent
a
major
blow
to
the
free
software
foundation
as
far
as
torvalds
was
concerned
he
was
simply
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
kids
taking
apart
and
reassembling
things
just
for
fun
nevertheless
when
summing
up
the
runaway
success
of
a
project
that
could
have
just
as
easily
spent
the
rest
of
its
days
on
an
abandoned
computer
hard
drive
torvalds
credits
his
younger
self
for
having
the
wisdom
to
give
up
control
and
accept
the
gpl
bargain
i
may
not
have
seen
the
light
writes
torvalds
reflecting
on
stallman
polytechnic
university
speech
and
his
subsequent
decision
to
switch
to
the
gpl
but
i
guess
something
from
his
speech
sunk
in
see
linus
torvalds
and
david
diamond
just
for
fun
the
story
of
an
accidentaly
revolutionary
harpercollins
publishers
interview
offers
an
interesting
not
to
mention
candid
glimpse
at
stallman
political
attitudes
during
the
earliest
days
of
the
gnu
project
it
is
also
helpful
in
tracing
the
evolution
of
rhetoric
describing
the
purpose
of
the
gpl
stallman
says
i
trying
to
change
the
way
people
approach
knowledge
and
information
in
general
i
think
that
to
try
to
own
knowledge
to
try
to
control
whether
people
are
allowed
to
use
it
or
to
try
to
stop
other
people
from
sharing
it
is
sabotage
contrast
this
with
a
statement
to
the
author
in
august
i
urge
you
not
to
use
the
term
property
in
your
thinking
it
will
lead
you
to
misunderstand
things
because
that
term
generalizes
about
copyrights
patents
and
trademarks
and
those
things
are
so
different
in
their
effects
that
it
is
entirely
foolish
to
try
to
talk
about
them
at
once
if
you
hear
somebody
saying
something
about
intellectual
property
without
quotes
then
he
not
thinking
very
clearly
and
you
should
join
by
the
free
software
movement
was
at
a
crossroads
to
the
optimistically
inclined
all
signs
pointed
toward
success
for
the
hacker
cultur
wired
magazine
a
funky
new
publication
offering
stories
on
data
encryption
usenet
and
software
freedom
was
flying
off
magazine
racks
the
internet
once
a
slang
term
used
only
by
hackers
and
research
scientists
had
found
its
way
into
mainstream
lexicon
even
president
clinton
was
using
it
the
personal
computer
once
a
hobbyist
toy
had
grown
to
respectability
giving
a
whole
new
generation
of
computer
users
access
to
software
and
while
the
gnu
project
had
not
yet
reached
its
goal
of
a
fully
intact
free
software
operating
system
curious
users
could
still
try
linux
in
the
interim
any
way
you
sliced
it
the
news
was
good
or
so
it
seemed
after
a
decade
of
struggle
hackers
and
hacker
values
were
finally
gaining
acceptance
in
mainstream
society
people
were
getting
it
or
were
they
to
the
pessimistically
inclined
each
sign
of
acceptance
carried
its
own
troubling
countersign
sure
being
a
hacker
was
suddenly
cool
but
was
cool
good
for
a
community
that
thrived
on
alienation
sure
the
white
house
was
saying
all
the
right
things
about
the
internet
even
going
so
far
as
to
register
its
own
domain
name
but
it
was
also
meeting
with
the
companies
censorship
advocates
and
officials
looking
to
tame
the
internet
wild
west
culture
sure
pcs
were
more
powerful
but
in
commoditizing
the
pc
marketplace
with
its
chips
intel
had
created
a
situation
in
which
proprietary
software
vendors
now
held
the
power
for
every
new
user
won
over
to
the
free
software
cause
via
linux
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
were
booting
up
microsoft
windows
for
the
first
time
finally
there
was
the
curious
nature
of
linux
itself
unrestricted
by
design
bugs
like
gnu
and
legal
disputes
like
bsd
linux
evolution
had
been
so
unplanned
its
success
so
accidental
that
programmers
closest
to
the
software
code
itself
know
what
to
make
of
it
more
compilation
album
than
operating
system
it
was
comprised
of
a
hacker
medley
of
greatest
hits
everything
from
gcc
gdb
and
glibc
the
gnu
project
newly
developed
c
library
to
x
a
graphic
user
interface
developed
by
laboratory
for
computer
science
to
tools
such
as
bind
the
berkeley
internet
naming
daemon
which
lets
users
substitute
internet
domain
names
for
numeric
ip
addresses
and
the
arch
capstone
of
course
was
the
linux
a
version
of
minix
rather
than
building
their
operating
system
from
scratch
torvalds
and
his
rapidly
expanding
linux
development
team
had
followed
the
old
picasso
adage
good
artists
borrow
great
artists
steal
or
as
torvalds
himself
would
later
translate
it
when
describing
the
secret
of
his
success
i
basically
a
very
lazy
person
who
likes
to
take
credit
for
things
other
people
actually
do
torvalds
has
offered
this
quote
in
many
different
settings
to
date
however
the
quote
most
notable
appearance
is
in
the
eric
raymond
essay
the
cathedral
and
the
bazaar
may
http
such
laziness
while
admirable
from
an
efficiency
perspective
was
troubling
from
a
political
perspective
for
one
thing
it
underlined
the
lack
of
an
ideological
agenda
on
torvalds
part
unlike
the
gnu
developers
torvalds
had
built
an
operating
system
out
of
a
desire
to
give
his
fellow
hackers
something
to
work
with
he
built
it
to
have
something
he
himself
could
play
with
like
tom
sawyer
whitewashing
a
fence
torvalds
genius
lay
less
in
the
overall
vision
and
more
in
his
ability
to
recruit
other
hackers
to
speed
the
process
that
torvalds
and
his
recruits
had
succeeded
where
others
had
not
raised
its
own
troubling
question
what
exactly
was
linux
was
it
a
manifestation
of
the
free
software
philosophy
first
articulated
by
stallman
in
the
gnu
manifesto
or
was
it
simply
an
amalgamation
of
nifty
software
tools
that
any
user
similarly
motivated
could
assemble
on
his
own
home
system
by
late
a
growing
number
of
linux
users
had
begun
to
lean
toward
the
latter
definition
and
began
brewing
private
variations
on
the
linux
theme
they
even
became
bold
enough
to
bottle
and
sell
their
distributions
fellow
unix
aficionados
the
results
were
spotty
at
best
this
was
back
before
red
hat
and
the
other
commercial
distributions
remembers
ian
murdock
then
a
computer
science
student
at
purdue
university
you
flip
through
unix
magazines
and
find
all
these
business
ads
proclaiming
most
of
the
companies
were
operations
that
saw
nothing
wrong
with
slipping
a
little
of
their
own
source
code
into
the
mix
murdock
a
unix
programmer
remembers
being
swept
away
by
linux
when
he
first
downloaded
and
installed
it
on
his
home
pc
system
it
was
just
a
lot
of
fun
he
says
it
made
me
want
to
get
involved
the
explosion
of
poorly
built
distributions
began
to
dampen
his
early
enthusiasm
however
deciding
that
the
best
way
to
get
involved
was
to
build
a
version
of
linux
free
of
additives
murdock
set
about
putting
a
list
of
the
best
free
software
tools
available
with
the
intention
of
folding
them
into
his
own
distribution
i
wanted
something
that
would
live
up
to
the
linux
name
murdock
says
in
a
bid
to
stir
up
some
interest
murdock
posted
his
intentions
on
the
internet
including
newsgroup
one
of
the
first
responding
email
messages
was
from
rms
as
a
hacker
murdock
instantly
recognized
the
address
it
was
richard
stallman
founder
of
the
gnu
project
and
a
man
murdock
knew
even
back
then
as
the
hacker
of
hackers
seeing
the
address
in
his
mail
queue
murdock
was
puzzled
why
on
earth
would
stallman
a
person
leading
his
own
project
care
about
murdock
gripes
over
linux
murdock
opened
the
message
he
said
the
free
software
foundation
was
starting
to
look
closely
at
linux
and
that
the
fsf
was
interested
in
possibly
doing
a
linux
system
too
basically
it
looked
to
stallman
like
our
goals
were
in
line
with
their
philosophy
the
message
represented
a
dramatic
on
stallman
part
until
stallman
had
been
content
to
keep
his
nose
out
of
the
linux
community
affairs
in
fact
he
had
all
but
shunned
the
renegade
operating
system
when
it
first
appeared
on
the
unix
programming
landscape
in
after
receiving
the
first
notification
of
a
operating
system
that
ran
on
pcs
stallman
says
he
delegated
the
task
of
examining
the
new
operating
system
to
a
friend
recalls
stallman
he
reported
back
that
the
software
was
modeled
after
system
v
which
was
the
inferior
version
of
unix
he
also
told
me
it
was
portable
the
friend
report
was
correct
built
to
run
on
machines
linux
was
firmly
rooted
to
its
hardware
platform
what
the
friend
failed
to
report
however
was
the
sizable
advantage
linux
enjoyed
as
the
only
freely
modifiable
operating
system
in
the
marketplace
in
other
words
while
stallman
spent
the
next
three
years
listening
to
bug
reports
from
his
hurd
team
torvalds
was
winning
over
the
programmers
who
would
later
uproot
and
replant
the
operating
system
onto
new
platforms
by
the
gnu
project
inability
to
deliver
a
working
kernel
was
leading
to
problems
both
within
the
gnu
project
and
within
the
free
software
movement
at
large
a
march
a
wired
magazine
article
by
simson
garfinkel
described
the
gnu
project
as
bogged
down
despite
the
success
of
the
project
many
simson
garfinkel
is
stallman
stalled
wired
march
those
within
the
project
and
its
nonprofit
adjunct
the
free
software
foundation
remember
the
mood
as
being
even
worse
than
garfinkel
article
let
on
it
was
very
clear
at
least
to
me
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
window
of
opportunity
to
introduce
a
new
operating
system
says
chassell
and
once
that
window
was
closed
people
would
become
less
interested
which
is
in
fact
exactly
what
happened
chassel
concern
about
there
being
a
window
for
a
new
operating
system
is
not
unique
to
the
gnu
project
during
the
early
free
software
versions
of
the
berkeley
software
distribution
were
held
up
by
unix
system
laboratories
lawsuit
restricting
the
release
of
software
while
many
users
consider
bsd
offshoots
such
as
freebsd
and
openbsd
to
be
demonstrably
superior
to
both
in
terms
of
performance
and
security
the
number
of
freebsd
and
openbsd
users
remains
a
fraction
of
the
total
user
population
to
view
a
sample
analysis
of
the
relative
success
of
in
relation
to
other
free
software
operating
systems
see
the
essay
by
new
zealand
hacker
liam
greenwood
why
is
linux
successful
much
has
been
made
about
the
gnu
project
struggles
during
the
period
while
some
place
the
blame
on
stallman
for
those
struggles
eric
raymond
an
early
member
of
the
gnu
emacs
team
and
later
stallman
critic
says
the
problem
was
largely
institutional
the
fsf
got
arrogant
raymond
says
they
moved
away
from
the
goal
of
doing
a
operating
system
to
doing
research
even
worse
they
thought
nothing
outside
the
fsf
could
affect
them
murdock
a
person
less
privy
to
the
inner
dealings
of
the
gnu
project
adopts
a
more
charitable
view
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is
they
were
a
little
too
ambitious
and
they
threw
good
money
after
bad
he
says
in
the
late
and
early
were
a
hot
topic
unfortunately
that
was
about
the
time
that
the
gnu
project
started
to
design
their
kernel
they
ended
up
with
alot
of
baggage
and
it
would
have
taken
a
lot
of
backpedaling
to
lose
it
stallman
cites
a
number
of
issues
when
explaining
the
delay
the
lotus
and
apple
lawsuits
had
provided
political
distractions
which
coupled
with
inability
to
type
made
it
difficult
for
stallman
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
hurd
team
stallman
also
cites
poor
communication
between
various
portions
of
the
gnu
project
we
had
to
do
a
lot
of
work
to
get
the
debugging
environment
to
work
he
recalls
and
the
people
maintaining
gdb
at
the
time
were
not
that
cooperative
mostly
however
stallman
says
he
and
the
other
members
of
the
gnu
project
team
underestimated
the
difficulty
of
expanding
the
mach
microkernal
into
a
unix
kernel
i
figured
ok
the
mach
part
that
has
to
talk
to
the
machine
has
already
been
debugged
stallman
says
recalling
the
hurd
team
troubles
in
a
speech
with
that
head
start
we
should
be
able
to
get
it
done
faster
but
instead
it
turned
out
that
debugging
these
asynchronous
multithreaded
programs
was
really
hard
there
were
timing
books
that
would
clobber
the
files
and
that
no
fun
the
end
result
was
that
it
took
many
many
years
to
produce
a
test
version
see
maui
high
performance
computing
center
speech
whatever
the
excuse
or
excuses
the
concurrent
success
of
the
team
created
a
tense
situation
sure
the
linux
kernel
had
been
licensed
under
the
gpl
but
as
murdock
himself
had
noted
the
desire
to
treat
linux
as
a
purely
free
software
operating
system
was
far
from
uniform
by
late
the
total
linux
user
population
had
grown
from
a
dozen
or
so
minix
enthusiasts
to
somewhere
between
and
numbers
are
sketchy
at
best
which
is
why
i
provided
such
a
broad
range
the
total
comes
from
the
red
hat
milestones
site
http
what
had
once
been
a
hobby
was
now
a
marketplace
ripe
for
exploitation
like
winston
churchill
watching
soviet
troops
sweep
into
berlin
stallman
felt
an
understandable
set
of
mixed
emotions
when
it
came
time
to
celebrate
the
linux
victory
i
wrote
this
winston
churchill
analogy
before
stallman
himself
sent
me
his
own
unsolicited
comment
on
churchill
world
war
ii
and
the
determination
needed
to
win
it
was
a
very
strong
memory
as
i
was
growing
up
statements
such
as
churchill
we
will
fight
them
in
the
landing
zones
we
will
fight
them
on
the
beaches
we
will
never
surrender
have
always
resonated
for
me
although
late
to
the
party
stallman
still
had
clout
as
soon
as
the
fsf
announced
that
it
would
lend
its
money
and
moral
support
to
murdock
software
project
other
offers
of
support
began
rolling
in
murdock
dubbed
the
new
project
compression
of
his
and
his
wife
deborah
within
a
few
weeks
was
rolling
out
the
first
distribution
support
catapulted
debian
almost
overnight
from
this
interesting
little
project
to
something
people
within
the
community
had
to
pay
attention
to
murdock
says
in
january
of
murdock
issued
the
debian
manifesto
written
in
the
spirit
of
stallman
gnu
manifesto
from
a
decade
before
it
explained
the
importance
of
working
closely
with
the
free
software
foundation
murdock
wrote
the
free
software
foundation
plays
an
extremely
important
role
in
the
future
of
debian
by
the
simple
fact
that
they
will
be
distributing
it
a
message
is
sent
to
the
world
that
linux
is
not
a
commercial
product
and
that
it
never
should
be
but
that
this
does
not
mean
that
linux
will
never
be
able
to
compete
commercially
for
those
of
you
who
disagree
i
challenge
you
to
rationalize
the
success
of
gnu
emacs
and
gcc
which
are
not
commercial
software
but
which
have
had
quite
an
impact
on
the
commercial
market
regardless
of
that
fact
the
time
has
come
to
concentrate
on
the
future
of
linux
rather
than
on
the
destructive
goal
of
enriching
oneself
at
the
expense
of
the
entire
linux
community
and
its
future
the
development
and
distribution
of
debian
may
not
be
the
answer
to
the
problems
that
i
have
outlined
in
the
manifesto
but
i
hope
that
it
will
at
least
attract
enough
attention
to
these
problems
to
allow
them
to
be
solved
shortly
after
the
release
the
free
software
foundation
made
its
first
major
request
stallman
wanted
murdock
to
call
its
distribution
at
first
murdock
says
stallman
had
wanted
to
use
the
term
lignux
as
in
linux
with
gnu
at
the
heart
of
it
a
sample
testing
of
the
term
on
usenet
and
in
various
impromptu
hacker
focus
groups
had
merited
enough
catcalls
to
convince
stallman
to
go
with
the
less
awkward
although
some
would
dismiss
stallman
attempt
to
add
the
gnu
prefix
as
a
belated
quest
for
credit
murdock
saw
it
differently
looking
back
murdock
saw
it
as
an
attempt
to
counteract
the
growing
tension
between
gnu
project
and
developers
there
was
a
split
emerging
murdock
recalls
richard
was
concerned
the
deepest
split
murdock
says
was
over
glibc
short
for
gnu
c
library
glibc
is
the
package
that
lets
programmers
make
system
calls
directed
at
the
kernel
over
the
course
of
glibc
emerged
as
a
troublesome
bottleneck
in
linux
development
because
so
many
new
users
were
adding
new
functions
to
the
linux
kernel
the
gnu
project
glibc
maintainers
were
soon
overwhelmed
with
suggested
changes
frustrated
by
delays
and
the
gnu
project
growing
reputation
for
some
linux
developers
suggested
creating
a
fork
a
c
library
parallel
to
glibc
in
the
hacker
world
forks
are
an
interesting
phenomenon
although
the
hacker
ethic
permits
a
programmer
to
do
anything
he
wants
with
a
given
program
source
code
most
hackers
prefer
to
pour
their
innovations
into
a
central
file
or
tree
to
ensure
compatibility
with
other
programs
to
fork
glibc
this
early
in
the
development
of
linux
would
have
meant
losing
the
potential
input
of
hundreds
even
thousands
of
linux
developers
it
would
also
mean
growing
incompatibility
between
linux
and
the
gnu
system
that
stallman
and
the
gnu
team
still
hoped
to
develop
as
leader
of
the
gnu
project
stallman
had
already
experienced
the
negative
effects
of
a
software
fork
in
a
group
of
emacs
developers
working
for
a
software
company
named
lucid
had
a
falling
out
over
stallman
unwillingness
to
fold
changes
back
into
the
gnu
emacs
code
base
the
fork
had
given
birth
to
a
parallel
version
lucid
emacs
and
hard
feelings
all
zawinski
a
former
lucid
programmer
who
would
go
on
to
head
the
mozilla
development
team
has
a
web
site
that
documents
the
emacs
fork
titled
the
schism
http
murdock
says
debian
was
mounting
work
on
a
similar
fork
in
glibc
source
code
that
motivated
stallman
to
insist
on
adding
the
gnu
prefix
when
debian
rolled
out
its
software
distribution
the
fork
has
since
converged
still
at
the
time
there
was
a
concern
that
if
the
linux
community
saw
itself
as
a
different
thing
as
the
gnu
community
it
might
be
a
force
for
disunity
stallman
seconds
murdock
recollection
in
fact
he
says
there
were
nascent
forks
appearing
in
relation
to
every
major
gnu
component
at
first
stallman
says
he
considered
the
forks
to
be
a
product
of
sour
grapes
in
contrast
to
the
fast
and
informal
dynamics
of
the
team
gnu
maintainers
tended
to
be
slower
and
more
circumspect
in
making
changes
that
might
affect
a
program
viability
they
also
were
unafraid
of
harshly
critiquing
other
code
over
time
however
stallman
began
to
sense
that
there
was
an
underlying
lack
of
awareness
of
the
gnu
project
and
its
objectives
when
reading
linux
developers
emails
we
discovered
that
the
people
who
considered
themselves
linux
users
did
care
about
the
gnu
project
stallman
says
they
said
should
i
bother
doing
these
things
i
do
care
about
the
gnu
project
it
working
for
me
it
working
for
us
linux
users
and
nothing
else
matters
to
us
and
that
was
quite
surprising
given
that
people
were
essentially
using
a
variant
of
the
gnu
system
and
they
cared
so
little
they
cared
less
than
anybody
else
about
gnu
while
some
viewed
descriptions
of
linux
as
a
variant
of
the
gnu
project
as
politically
grasping
murdock
already
sympathetic
to
the
free
software
cause
saw
stallman
request
to
call
debian
version
as
reasonable
it
was
more
for
unity
than
for
credit
he
says
requests
of
a
more
technical
nature
quickly
followed
although
murdock
had
been
accommodating
on
political
issues
he
struck
a
firmer
pose
when
it
came
to
the
design
and
development
model
of
the
actual
software
what
had
begun
as
a
show
of
solidarity
soon
became
of
model
of
other
gnu
projects
i
can
tell
you
that
i
had
my
share
of
disagreements
with
him
says
murdock
with
a
laugh
in
all
honesty
richard
can
be
a
fairly
difficult
person
to
work
with
in
murdock
following
his
graduation
from
purdue
decided
to
hand
over
the
reins
of
the
growing
debian
project
he
had
already
been
ceding
management
duties
to
bruce
perens
the
hacker
best
known
for
his
work
on
electric
fence
a
unix
utility
released
under
the
gpl
perens
like
murdock
was
a
unix
programmer
who
had
become
enamored
of
as
soon
as
the
abilities
became
manifest
like
murdock
perens
sympathized
with
the
political
agenda
of
stallman
and
the
free
software
foundation
albeit
from
afar
i
remember
after
stallman
had
already
come
out
with
the
gnu
manifesto
gnu
emacs
and
gcc
i
read
an
article
that
said
he
was
working
as
a
consultant
for
intel
says
perens
recalling
his
first
brush
with
stallman
in
the
late
i
wrote
him
asking
how
he
could
be
advocating
free
software
on
the
one
hand
and
working
for
intel
on
the
other
he
wrote
back
saying
work
as
a
consultant
to
produce
free
software
he
was
perfectly
polite
about
it
and
i
thought
his
answer
made
perfect
sense
as
a
prominent
debian
developer
however
perens
regarded
murdock
design
battles
with
stallman
with
dismay
upon
assuming
leadership
of
the
development
team
perens
says
he
made
the
command
decision
to
distance
debian
from
the
free
software
foundation
i
decided
we
did
not
want
richard
style
of
he
says
according
to
perens
stallman
was
taken
aback
by
the
decision
but
had
the
wisdom
to
roll
with
it
he
gave
it
some
time
to
cool
off
and
sent
a
message
that
we
really
needed
a
relationship
he
requested
that
we
call
it
and
left
it
at
that
i
decided
that
was
fine
i
made
the
decision
unilaterally
everybody
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
over
time
debian
would
develop
a
reputation
as
the
hacker
version
of
linux
alongside
slackware
another
popular
distribution
founded
during
the
same
period
outside
the
realm
of
systems
however
linux
was
picking
up
steam
in
the
commercial
unix
marketplace
in
north
carolina
a
unix
company
billing
itself
as
red
hat
was
revamping
its
business
to
focus
on
linux
the
chief
executive
officer
was
robert
young
the
former
linux
journal
editor
who
in
had
put
the
question
to
linus
torvalds
asking
whether
he
had
any
regrets
about
putting
the
kernel
under
the
gpl
to
young
torvalds
response
had
a
profound
impact
on
his
own
view
toward
linux
instead
of
looking
for
a
way
to
corner
the
market
via
traditional
software
tactics
young
began
to
consider
what
might
happen
if
a
company
adopted
the
same
approach
as
building
an
operating
system
completely
out
of
free
software
parts
cygnus
solutions
the
company
founded
by
michael
tiemann
and
john
gilmore
in
was
already
demonstrating
the
ability
to
sell
free
software
based
on
quality
and
customizability
what
if
red
hat
took
the
same
approach
with
in
the
western
scientific
tradition
we
stand
on
the
shoulders
of
giants
says
young
echoing
both
torvalds
and
sir
isaac
newton
before
him
in
business
this
translates
to
not
having
to
reinvent
wheels
as
we
go
along
the
beauty
of
the
gpl
model
is
you
put
your
code
into
the
public
uses
the
term
public
domain
incorrectly
here
public
domain
means
not
protected
by
copyright
programs
are
by
definition
protected
by
copyright
if
you
an
independent
software
vendor
and
trying
to
build
some
application
and
you
need
a
well
why
reinvent
modem
dialers
you
can
just
steal
ppp
off
of
red
hat
linux
and
use
that
as
the
core
of
your
tool
if
you
need
a
graphic
tool
set
you
do
have
to
write
your
own
graphic
library
just
download
gtk
suddenly
you
have
the
ability
to
reuse
the
best
of
what
went
before
and
suddenly
your
focus
as
an
application
vendor
is
less
on
software
management
and
more
on
writing
the
applications
specific
to
your
customer
needs
young
was
the
only
software
executive
intrigued
by
the
business
efficiencies
of
free
software
by
late
most
unix
companies
were
starting
to
wake
up
and
smell
the
brewing
source
code
the
linux
sector
was
still
a
good
year
or
two
away
from
full
commercial
breakout
mode
but
those
close
enough
to
the
hacker
community
could
feel
it
something
big
was
happening
the
intel
chip
the
internet
and
the
world
wide
web
had
hit
the
marketplace
like
a
set
of
monster
waves
and
the
host
of
software
programs
that
echoed
it
in
terms
of
accessibility
and
permissive
like
the
largest
wave
yet
for
ian
murdock
the
programmer
courted
by
stallman
and
then
later
turned
off
by
stallman
micromanagement
style
the
wave
seemed
both
a
fitting
tribute
and
a
fitting
punishment
for
the
man
who
had
spent
so
much
time
giving
the
free
software
movement
an
identity
like
many
linux
aficionados
murdock
had
seen
the
original
postings
he
seen
torvalds
original
admonition
that
linux
was
just
a
hobby
he
also
seen
torvalds
admission
to
minix
creator
andrew
tanenbaum
if
the
gnu
kernel
had
been
ready
last
spring
i
not
have
bothered
to
even
start
my
project
this
quote
is
taken
from
the
flame
war
following
the
initial
release
of
linux
in
the
process
of
defending
his
choice
of
a
nonportable
monolithic
kernel
design
torvalds
says
he
started
working
on
linux
as
a
way
to
learn
more
about
his
new
pc
if
the
gnu
kernel
had
been
ready
last
spring
i
not
have
bothered
to
even
start
my
project
see
chris
dibona
et
open
sources
associates
like
many
murdock
knew
the
opportunities
that
had
been
squandered
he
also
knew
the
excitement
of
watching
new
opportunities
come
seeping
out
of
the
very
fabric
of
the
internet
being
involved
with
linux
in
those
early
days
was
fun
recalls
murdock
at
the
same
time
it
was
something
to
do
something
to
pass
the
time
if
you
go
back
and
read
those
old
exchanges
you
see
the
sentiment
this
is
something
we
can
play
with
until
the
hurd
is
ready
people
were
anxious
funny
but
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
suspect
that
linux
would
never
have
happened
if
the
hurd
had
come
along
more
quickly
by
the
end
of
however
such
what
if
questions
were
already
moot
call
it
linux
call
it
the
users
had
spoken
the
window
had
closed
meaning
that
even
if
the
gnu
project
had
rolled
out
its
hurd
kernel
chances
were
slim
anybody
outside
the
hacker
community
would
have
noticed
the
first
free
software
operating
system
was
here
and
it
had
momentum
all
hackers
had
left
to
do
was
sit
back
and
wait
for
the
next
major
wave
to
come
crashing
down
on
their
heads
even

in
november
peter
salus
a
member
of
the
free
software
foundation
and
author
of
the
book

quarter
century
of

issued
a
call
for
papers
to
members
of

mailing

salus
the
conference
scheduled
chairman
wanted
to
tip
off
fellow
hackers
about
the
upcoming
conference
on
freely
redistributable
software
in
cambridge
massachusetts
slated
for
february
and
sponsored
by
the
free
software
foundation
the
event
promised
to
be
the
first
engineering
conference
solely
dedicated
to
free
software
and
in
a
show
of
unity
with
other
free
software
programmers
welcomed
papers
on
any
aspect
of
gnu
linux
netbsd
freebsd
perl
and
other
tools
for
which
the
code
is
accessible
and
redistributable
salus
wrote
over
the
past
years
free
and
software
has
become
ubiquitous
this
conference
will
bring
together
implementers
of
several
different
types
of
freely
redistributable
software
and
publishers
of
such
software
on
various
media
there
will
be
tutorials
and
refereed
papers
as
well
as
keynotes
by

one
of
the
first
people
to
receive
salus
email
was
conference
committee
member
eric
raymond
although
not
the
leader
of
a
project
or
company
like
the
various
other
members
of
the
list
raymond
had
built
a
tidy
reputation
within
the
hacker
community
as
a
major
contributor
to
gnu
emacs
and
as
editor
of
the
new
hacker
dictionary
a
book
version
of
the
hacking
community
jargon
file
for
raymond
the
conference
was
a
welcome
event
active
in
the
gnu
project
during
the
raymond
had
distanced
himself
from
the
project
in
citing
like
many
others
before
him
style
richard
kicked
up
a
fuss
about
my
making
unauthorized
modifications
when
i
was
cleaning
up
the
emacs
lisp
libraries
raymond
recalls
it
frustrated
me
so
much
that
i
decided
i
did
want
to
work
with
him
anymore
despite
the
falling
out
raymond
remained
active
in
the
free
software
community
so
much
so
that
when
salus
suggested
a
conference
pairing
stallman
and
torvalds
as
keynote
speakers
raymond
eagerly
seconded
the
idea
with
stallman
representing
the
older
wiser
contingent
of
hackers
and
torvalds
representing
the
younger
more
energetic
crop
of
linux
hackers
the
pairing
indicated
a
symbolic
show
of
unity
that
could
only
be
beneficial
especially
to
ambitious
younger
below
hackers
such
as
raymond
i
sort
of
had
a
foot
in
both
camps
raymond
says
by
the
time
of
the
conference
the
tension
between
those
two
camps
had
become
palpable
both
groups
had
one
thing
in
common
though
the
conference
was
their
first
chance
to
meet
the
finnish
wunderkind
in
the
flesh
surprisingly
torvalds
proved
himself
to
be
a
charming
affable
speaker
possessing
only
a
slight
swedish
accent
torvalds
surprised
audience
members
with
his
quick
linus
torvalds
is
finnish
his
mother
tongue
is
swedish
the
rampantly
unofficial
linus
faq
offers
a
brief
explanation
finland
has
a
significant
about
minority
population
they
call
themselves
finlandssvensk
or
finlandssvenskar
and
consider
themselves
finns
many
of
their
families
have
lived
in
finland
for
centuries
swedish
is
one
of
finland
two
official
languages
http
even
more
surprising
says
raymond
was
equal
willingness
to
take
potshots
at
other
prominent
hackers
including
the
most
prominent
hacker
of
all
richard
stallman
by
the
end
of
the
conference
torvalds
manner
was
winning
over
older
and
younger
alike
it
was
a
pivotal
moment
recalls
raymond
before
richard
was
the
only
credible
claimant
to
being
the
ideological
leader
of
the
entire
culture
people
who
dissented
did
do
so
in
public
the
person
who
broke
that
taboo
was
torvalds
the
ultimate
breach
of
taboo
would
come
near
the
end
of
the
show
during
a
discussion
on
the
growing
market
dominance
of
microsoft
windows
or
some
similar
topic
torvalds
admitted
to
being
a
fan
of
powerpoint
slideshow
software
program
from
the
perspective
of
software
purists
it
was
like
a
mormon
bragging
in
church
about
his
fondness
of
whiskey
from
the
perspective
of
torvalds
and
his
growing
band
of
followers
it
was
simply
common
sense
why
shun
worthy
proprietary
software
programs
just
to
make
a
point
being
a
hacker
was
about
suffering
it
was
about
getting
the
job
done
that
was
a
pretty
shocking
thing
to
say
raymond
remembers
then
again
he
was
able
to
do
that
because
by
and
he
was
rapidly
acquiring
clout
stallman
for
his
part
does
remember
any
tension
at
the
conference
but
he
does
remember
later
feeling
the
sting
of
torvalds
celebrated
cheekiness
there
was
a
thing
in
the
linux
documentation
which
says
print
out
the
gnu
coding
standards
and
then
tear
them
up
says
stallman
recalling
one
example
ok
so
he
disagrees
with
some
of
our
conventions
that
fine
but
he
picked
a
singularly
nasty
way
of
saying
so
he
could
have
just
said
the
way
i
think
you
should
indent
your
code
fine
there
should
be
no
hostility
there
for
raymond
the
warm
reception
other
hackers
gave
to
torvalds
comments
merely
confirmed
his
suspicions
the
dividing
line
separating
linux
developers
from
developers
was
largely
generational
many
linux
hackers
like
torvalds
had
grown
up
in
a
world
of
proprietary
software
unless
a
program
was
clearly
inferior
most
saw
little
reason
to
rail
against
a
program
on
licensing
issues
alone
somewhere
in
the
universe
of
free
software
systems
lurked
a
program
that
hackers
might
someday
turn
into
a
free
software
alternative
to
powerpoint
until
then
why
begrudge
microsoft
the
initiative
of
developing
the
program
and
reserving
the
rights
to
it
as
a
former
gnu
project
member
raymond
sensed
an
added
dynamic
to
the
tension
between
stallman
and
torvalds
in
the
decade
since
launching
the
gnu
project
stallman
had
built
up
a
fearsome
reputation
as
a
programmer
he
had
also
built
up
a
reputation
for
intransigence
both
in
terms
of
software
design
and
people
management
shortly
before
the
conference
the
free
software
foundation
would
experience
a
staff
defection
blamed
in
large
part
on
stallman
brian
youmans
a
current
fsf
staffer
hired
by
salus
in
the
wake
of
the
resignations
recalls
the
scene
at
one
point
peter
salus
was
the
only
staff
member
working
in
the
office
for
raymond
the
defection
merely
confirmed
a
growing
suspicion
recent
delays
such
as
the
hurd
and
recent
troubles
such
as
the
schism
reflected
problems
normally
associated
with
software
project
management
not
software
code
development
shortly
after
the
freely
redistributable
software
conference
raymond
began
working
on
his
own
pet
software
project
a
popmail
utility
called
fetchmail
taking
a
cue
from
torvalds
raymond
issued
his
program
with
a
promise
to
update
the
source
code
as
early
and
as
often
as
possible
when
users
began
sending
in
bug
reports
and
feature
suggestions
raymond
at
first
anticipating
a
tangled
mess
found
the
resulting
software
surprisingly
sturdy
analyzing
the
success
of
the
torvalds
approach
raymond
issued
a
quick
analysis
using
the
internet
as
his
petri
dish
and
the
harsh
scrutiny
of
the
hacker
community
as
a
form
of
natural
selection
torvalds
had
created
an
evolutionary
model
free
of
central
planning
what
more
raymond
decided
torvalds
had
found
a
way
around
brooks
law
first
articulated
by
fred
brooks
manager
of
ibm
project
and
author
of
the
book
the
mythical
brooks
law
held
that
adding
developers
to
a
project
only
resulted
in
further
project
delays
believing
as
most
hackers
that
software
like
soup
benefits
from
a
limited
number
of
cooks
raymond
sensed
something
revolutionary
at
work
in
inviting
more
and
more
cooks
into
the
kitchen
torvalds
had
actually
found
away
to
make
the
resulting
software
law
is
the
shorthand
summary
of
the
following
quote
taken
from
brooks
book
since
software
construction
is
inherently
a
systems
exercise
in
complex
effort
is
great
and
it
quickly
dominates
the
decrease
in
individual
task
time
brought
about
by
partitioning
adding
more
men
then
lengthens
not
shortens
the
schedule
see
fred
brooks
the
mythical
addison
wesley
publishing
raymond
put
his
observations
on
paper
he
crafted
them
into
a
speech
which
he
promptly
delivered
before
a
group
of
friends
and
neighbors
in
chester
county
pennsylvania
dubbed
the
cathedral
and
the
bazaar
the
speech
contrasted
the
management
styles
of
the
gnu
project
with
the
management
style
of
torvalds
and
the
kernel
hackers
raymond
says
the
response
was
enthusiastic
but
not
nearly
as
enthusiastic
as
the
one
he
received
during
the
linux
kongress
a
gathering
of
linux
users
in
germany
the
next
spring
at
the
kongress
they
gave
me
a
standing
ovation
at
the
end
of
the
speech
raymond
recalls
i
took
that
as
significant
for
two
reasons
for
one
thing
it
meant
they
were
excited
by
what
they
were
hearing
for
another
thing
it
meant
they
were
excited
even
after
hearing
the
speech
delivered
through
a
language
barrier
eventually
raymond
would
convert
the
speech
into
a
paper
also
titled
the
cathedral
and
the
bazaar
the
paper
drew
its
name
from
raymond
central
analogy
gnu
programs
were
cathedrals
impressive
centrally
planned
monuments
to
the
hacker
ethic
built
to
stand
the
test
of
time
linux
on
the
other
hand
was
more
like
a
great
babbling
bazaar
a
software
program
developed
through
the
loose
decentralizing
dynamics
of
the
internet
implicit
within
each
analogy
was
a
comparison
of
stallman
and
torvalds
where
stallman
served
as
the
classic
model
of
the
cathedral
a
programming
wizard
who
could
disappear
for
months
and
return
with
something
like
the
gnu
c
was
more
like
a
genial
host
in
letting
others
lead
the
linux
design
discussion
and
stepping
in
only
when
the
entire
table
needed
a
referee
torvalds
had
created
a
development
model
very
much
reflective
of
his
own
personality
from
the
torvalds
perspective
the
most
important
managerial
task
was
not
imposing
control
but
keeping
the
ideas
flowing
summarized
raymond
i
think
linus
cleverest
and
most
consequential
hack
was
not
the
construction
of
the
linux
kernel
itself
but
rather
his
invention
of
the
linux
development
model
see
eric
raymond
the
cathredral
and
the
bazaar
in
summarizing
the
secrets
of
torvalds
managerial
success
raymond
himself
had
pulled
off
a
coup
one
of
the
audience
members
at
the
linux
kongress
was
tim
publisher
of
associates
a
company
specializing
in
software
manuals
and
books
and
the
publisher
of
this
book
after
hearing
raymond
kongress
speech
promptly
invited
raymond
to
deliver
it
again
at
the
company
inaugural
perl
conference
later
that
year
in
monterey
california
although
the
conference
was
supposed
to
focus
on
perl
a
scripting
language
created
by
unix
hacker
larry
wall
assured
raymond
that
the
conference
would
address
other
free
software
technologies
given
the
growing
commercial
interest
in
linux
and
apache
a
popular
free
software
web
server
hoped
to
use
the
event
to
publicize
the
role
of
free
software
in
creating
the
entire
infrastructure
of
the
internet
from
languages
such
as
perl
and
python
to
programs
such
as
bind
the
berkeley
internet
naming
daemon
a
software
tool
that
lets
users
replace
arcane
ip
numbers
with
the
addresses
and
sendmail
the
most
popular
mail
program
on
the
internet
free
software
had
become
an
emergent
phenomenon
like
a
colony
of
ants
creating
a
beautiful
nest
one
grain
of
sand
at
a
time
the
only
thing
missing
was
the
communal
saw
raymond
speech
as
a
good
way
to
inspire
that
to
drive
home
the
point
that
free
software
development
did
start
and
end
with
the
gnu
project
programming
languages
such
as
perl
and
python
and
internet
software
such
as
bind
sendmail
and
apache
demonstrated
that
free
software
was
already
ubiquitous
and
influential
he
also
assured
raymond
an
even
warmer
reception
than
the
one
at
linux
kongress
was
right
this
time
i
got
the
standing
ovation
before
the
speech
says
raymond
laughing
as
predicted
the
audience
was
stocked
not
only
with
hackers
but
with
other
people
interested
in
the
growing
power
of
the
free
software
movement
one
contingent
included
a
group
from
netscape
the
mountain
view
california
startup
then
nearing
the
end
game
of
its
battle
with
microsoft
for
control
of
the
market
intrigued
by
raymond
speech
and
anxious
to
win
back
lost
market
share
netscape
executives
took
the
message
back
to
corporate
headquarters
a
few
months
later
in
january
the
company
announced
its
plan
to
publish
the
source
code
of
its
flagship
navigator
web
browser
in
the
hopes
of
enlisting
hacker
support
in
future
development

and
the
bazaar
essay
as
a
major
influence
upon
the
company
decision
the
company
instantly
elevated
raymond
to
the
level
of
hacker
celebrity
determined
not
to
squander
the
opportunity
raymond
traveled
west
to
deliver
interviews
advise
netscape
executives
and
take
part
in
the
eventual
party
celebrating
the
publication
of
netscape
source
code
the
code
name
for
navigator
source
code
was
mozilla
a
reference
both
to
the
gargantuan
million
lines
of
to
its
heritage
developed
as
a
proprietary
offshoot
of
mosaic
the
web
browser
created
by
marc
andreessen
at
the
university
of
illinois
mozilla
was
proof
yet
again
that
when
it
came
to
building
new
programs
most
programmers
preferred
to
borrow
on
older
modifiable
programs
while
in
california
raymond
also
managed
to
squeeze
in
a
visit
to
va
research
a
santa
company
selling
workstations
with
the
operating
system
preinstalled
convened
by
raymond
the
meeting
was
small
the
invite
list
included
va
founder
larry
augustin
a
few
va
employees
and
christine
peterson
president
of
the
foresight
institute
a
silicon
valley
think
tank
specializing
in
nanotechnology
the
meeting
agenda
boiled
down
to
one
item
how
to
take
advantage
of
netscape
decision
so
that
other
companies
might
follow
suit
raymond
does
recall
the
conversation
that
took
place
but
he
does
remember
the
first
complaint
addressed
despite
the
best
efforts
of
stallman
and
other
hackers
to
remind
people
that
the
word
free
in
free
software
stood
for
freedom
and
not
price
the
message
still
was
getting
through
most
business
executives
upon
hearing
the
term
for
the
first
time
interpreted
the
word
as
synonymous
with
zero
cost
tuning
out
any
follow
up
messages
in
short
order
until
hackers
found
a
way
to
get
past
this
cognitive
dissonance
the
free
software
movement
faced
an
uphill
climb
even
after
netscape
peterson
whose
organization
had
taken
an
active
interest
in
advancing
the
free
software
cause
offered
an
alternative
open
source
looking
back
peterson
says
she
came
up
with
the
open
source
term
while
discussing
netscape
decision
with
a
friend
in
the
public
relations
industry
she
remember
where
she
came
upon
the
term
or
if
she
borrowed
it
from
another
field
but
she
does
remember
her
friend
disliking
the
at
the
meeting
peterson
says
the
response
was
dramatically
different
i
was
hesitant
about
suggesting
it
peterson
recalls
i
had
no
standing
with
the
group
so
started
using
it
casually
not
highlighting
it
as
a
new
term
to
peterson
surprise
the
term
caught
on
by
the
end
of
the
meeting
most
of
the
attendees
including
raymond
seemed
pleased
by
it
raymond
says
he
did
publicly
use
the
term
open
source
as
a
substitute
for
free
software
until
a
day
or
two
after
the
mozilla
launch
party
when
had
scheduled
a
meeting
to
talk
about
free
software
calling
his
meeting
the
freeware
summit
says
he
wanted
to
direct
media
and
community
attention
to
the
other
deserving
projects
that
had
also
encouraged
netscape
to
release
mozilla
all
these
guys
had
so
much
in
common
and
i
was
surprised
they
all
know
each
other
says
i
also
wanted
to
let
the
world
know
just
how
great
an
impact
the
free
software
culture
had
already
made
people
were
missing
out
on
a
large
part
of
the
free
software
tradition
in
putting
together
the
invite
list
however
made
a
decision
that
would
have
political
consequences
he
decided
to
limit
the
list
to
developers
such
as
wall
eric
allman
creator
of
sendmail
and
paul
vixie
creator
of
bind
there
were
exceptions
of
course
raymond
who
was
already
in
town
thanks
to
the
mozilla
launch
earned
a
quick
invite
so
did
guido
van
rossum
creator
of
python
frank
willison
my
editor
in
chief
and
champion
of
python
within
the
company
invited
him
without
first
checking
in
with
me
recalls
i
was
happy
to
have
him
there
but
when
i
started
it
really
was
just
a
local
gathering
for
some
observers
the
unwillingness
to
include
stallman
name
on
the
list
qualified
as
a
snub
i
decided
not
to
go
to
the
event
because
of
it
says
perens
remembering
the
summit
raymond
who
did
go
says
he
argued
for
stallman
inclusion
to
no
avail
the
snub
rumor
gained
additional
strength
from
the
fact
that
the
event
host
had
feuded
publicly
with
stallman
over
the
issue
of
copyrights
prior
to
the
meeting
stallman
had
argued
that
free
software
manuals
should
be
as
freely
copyable
and
modifiable
as
free
software
programs
meanwhile
argued
that
a
market
for
nonfree
books
increased
the
utility
of
free
software
by
making
it
more
accessible
to
a
wider
community
the
two
had
also
disputed
the
title
of
the
event
with
stallman
insisting
on
free
software
over
the
less
politically
laden
freeware
looking
back
does
see
the
decision
to
leave
stallman
name
off
the
invite
list
as
a
snub
at
that
time
i
had
never
met
richard
in
person
but
in
our
email
interactions
he
been
inflexible
and
unwilling
to
engage
in
dialogue
i
wanted
to
make
sure
the
gnu
tradition
was
represented
at
the
meeting
so
i
invited
john
gilmore
and
michael
tiemann
whom
i
knew
personally
and
whom
i
knew
were
passionate
about
the
value
of
the
gpl
but
seemed
more
willing
to
engage
in
a
frank
about
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
various
free
software
projects
and
traditions
given
all
the
later
brouhaha
i
do
wish
i
invited
richard
as
well
but
i
certainly
do
think
that
my
failure
to
do
so
should
be
interpreted
as
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
gnu
project
or
for
richard
personally
snub
or
no
snub
both
and
raymond
say
the
term
open
source
won
over
just
enough
to
qualify
as
a
success
the
attendees
shared
ideas
and
experiences
and
brainstormed
on
how
to
improve
free
software
image
of
key
concern
was
how
to
point
out
the
successes
of
free
software
particularly
in
the
realm
of
internet
infrastructure
as
opposed
to
playing
up
the
challenge
to
microsoft
windows
but
like
the
earlier
meeting
at
va
the
discussion
soon
turned
to
the
problems
associated
with
the
term
free
software
the
summit
host
remembers
a
particularly
insightful
comment
from
torvalds
a
summit
attendee
linus
had
just
moved
to
silicon
valley
at
that
point
and
he
explained
how
only
recently
that
he
had
learned
that
the
word
had
two
as
in
and
free
as
in
english
michael
tiemann
founder
of
cygnus
proposed
an
alternative
to
the
troublesome
free
software
term
sourceware
nobody
got
too
excited
about
it
recalls
that
when
eric
threw
out
the
term
source
although
the
term
appealed
to
some
support
for
a
change
in
official
terminology
was
far
from
unanimous
at
the
end
of
the
conference
attendees
put
the
three
software
open
source
or
a
vote
according
to
out
of
the
attendees
voted
for
open
source
although
some
still
quibbled
with
the
term
all
attendees
agreed
to
use
it
in
future
discussions
with
the
press
we
wanted
to
go
out
with
a
solidarity
message
says
the
term
did
take
long
to
enter
the
national
lexicon
shortly
after
the
summit
shepherded
summit
attendees
to
a
press
conference
attended
by
reporters
from
the
new
york
times
the
wall
street
journal
and
other
prominent
publications
within
a
few
months
torvalds
face
was
appearing
on
the
cover
of
forbes
magazine
with
the
faces
of
stallman
perl
creator
larry
wall
and
apache
team
leader
brian
behlendorf
featured
in
the
interior
spread
open
source
was
open
for
business
for
summit
attendees
such
as
tiemann
the
solidarity
message
was
the
most
important
thing
although
his
company
had
achieved
a
fair
amount
of
success
selling
free
software
tools
and
services
he
sensed
the
difficulty
other
programmers
and
entrepreneurs
faced
there
no
question
that
the
use
of
the
word
free
was
confusing
in
a
lot
of
situations
tiemann
says
open
source
positioned
itself
as
being
business
friendly
and
business
sensible
free
software
positioned
itself
as
morally
righteous
for
better
or
worse
we
figured
it
was
more
advantageous
to
align
with
the
open
source
crowd
for
stallman
the
response
to
the
new
open
source
term
was
slow
in
coming
raymond
says
stallman
briefly
considered
adopting
the
term
only
to
discard
it
i
know
because
i
had
direct
personal
conversations
about
it
raymond
says
by
the
end
of
stallman
had
formulated
a
position
open
source
while
helpful
in
communicating
the
technical
advantages
of
free
software
also
encouraged
speakers
to
the
issue
of
software
freedom
given
this
drawback
stallman
would
stick
with
the
term
free
software
summing
up
his
position
at
the
linuxworld
convention
and
expo
an
event
billed
by
torvalds
himself
as
a
coming
out
party
for
the
linux
community
stallman
implored
his
fellow
hackers
to
resist
the
lure
of
easy
compromise
because
we
shown
how
much
we
can
do
we
do
have
to
be
desperate
to
work
with
companies
or
compromise
our
goals
stallman
said
during
a
panel
discussion
let
them
offer
and
we
accept
we
do
have
to
change
what
we
doing
to
get
them
to
help
us
you
can
take
a
single
step
towards
a
goal
then
another
and
then
more
and
more
and
you
actually
reach
your
goal
or
you
can
take
a
half
measure
that
means
you
ever
take
another
step
and
you
never
get
there
even
before
the
linuxworld
show
however
stallman
was
showing
an
increased
willingness
to
alienate
his
more
conciliatory
peers
a
few
months
after
the
freeware
summit
hosted
its
second
annual
perl
conference
this
time
around
stallman
was
in
attendance
during
a
panel
discussion
lauding
decision
to
employ
the
free
software
apache
web
server
in
its
commercial
offerings
stallman
taking
advantage
of
an
audience
microphone
disrupted
the
proceedings
with
a
tirade
against
panelist
john
ousterhout
creator
of
the
tcl
scripting
language
stallman
branded
ousterhout
a
parasite
on
the
free
software
community
for
marketing
a
proprietary
version
of
tcl
via
ousterhout
startup
company
scriptics
i
do
think
scriptics
is
necessary
for
the
continued
existence
of

discordant

stallman
perl
conference
outburst
would
momentarily
chase
off
another
potential
sympathizer
bruce
perens
in
eric
raymond
proposed
launching
the
open
source
initiative
or
osi
an
organization
that
would
police
the
use
of
the
term
open
source
and
provide
a
definition
for
companies
interested
in
making
their
own
programs
raymond
recruited
perens
to
draft
the
bruce
perens
et
the
open
source
definition
the
open
source
initiative
http
perens
would
later
resign
from
the
osi
expressing
regret
that
the
organization
had
set
itself
up
in
opposition
to
stallman
and
the
fsf
still
looking
back
on
the
need
for
a
free
software
definition
outside
the
free
software
foundation
auspices
perens
understands
why
other
hackers
might
still
feel
the
need
for
distance
i
really
like
and
admire
richard
says
perens
i
do
think
richard
would
do
his
job
better
if
richard
had
more
balance
that
includes
going
away
from
free
software
for
a
couple
of
months
stallman
monomaniacal
energies
would
do
little
to
counteract
the
momentum
of
open

proponents
in
august

by

raymond
penned
a
essay
in

raymond
mused
on
the
relationship
between
the
hacker
ethic
and
monetary
wealth
reporters
often
ask
me
these
days
if
i
think
the
community
will
be
corrupted
by
the
influx
of
big
money
i
tell

i
believe

is

been
so
intense
for
so
long
that
anyone
who
can

http
whether
or
not
such
comments
allayed
suspicions
that
raymond
and
other
open
source
proponents
had
simply
been
in
it
for
the
money
they
drove
home
the
open
source
community
ultimate
message
all
you
needed
to
sell
the
free
software
concept
is
a
friendly
face
and
a
sensible
message
instead
of
fighting
the
marketplace
as
stallman
had
done
raymond
torvalds
and
other
new
leaders
of
the
hacker
community
had
adopted
a
more
relaxed
the
marketplace
in
some
areas
leveraging
it
in
others
instead
of
playing
the
role
of
outcasts
they
had
played
the
game
of
celebrity
magnifying
their
power
in
the
process
on
his
worst
days
richard
believes
that
linus
torvalds
and
i
conspired
to
hijack
his
revolution
raymond
says
richard
rejection
of
the
term
open
source
and
his
deliberate
creation
of
an
ideological
fissure
in
my
view
comes
from
an
odd
mix
of
idealism
and
territoriality
there
are
people
out
there
who
think
it
all
richard
personal
ego
i
do
believe
that
it
more
that
he
so
personally
associates
himself
with
the
free
software
idea
that
he
sees
any
threat
to
that
as
a
threat
to
himself
ironically
the
success
of
open
source
and
open
source
advocates
such
as
raymond
would
not
diminish
role
as
a
leader
if
anything
it
gave
stallman
new
followers
to
convert
still
the
raymond
territoriality
charge
is
a
damning
one
there
are
numerous
instances
of
stallman
sticking
to
his
guns
more
out
of
habit
than
out
of
principle
his
initial
dismissal
of
the
linux
kernel
for
example
and
his
current
unwillingness
as
a
political
figure
to
venture
outside
the
realm
of
software
issues
then
again
as
the
recent
debate
over
open
source
also
shows
in
instances
when
stallman
has
stuck
to
his
guns
he
usually
found
a
way
to
gain
ground
because
of
it
one
of
stallman
primary
character
traits
is
the
fact
he
does
budge
says
ian
murdock
wait
up
to
a
decade
for
people
to
come
around
to
his
point
of
view
if
that
what
it
takes
murdock
for
one
finds
that
unbudgeable
nature
both
refreshing
and
valuable
stallman
may
no
longer
be
the
solitary
leader
of
the
free
software
movement
but
he
is
still
the
polestar
of
the
free
software
community
you
always
know
that
he
going
to
be
consistent
in
his
views
murdock
says
most
people
are
like
that
whether
you
agree
with
him
or
not
you
really
have
to
respect
that
a
brief
journey
through
hacker
hell
richard
stallman
stares
unblinking
through
the
windshield
of
a
rental
car
waiting
for
the
light
to
change

we
make
our

about
an
hour

so
it
about
two
hours
after

at

kihei
a
town
that
seemed
so
inviting
before
the
speech
now
seems
profoundly
uncooperative
like
most
beach
cities
kihei
is
a
exercise
in
suburban
sprawl
driving
down
its
main
drag
with
its
endless
succession
of
burger
stands
realty
agencies
and
bikini
shops
it
hard
not
to
feel
like
a
morsel
passing
through
the
alimentary
canal
of
a
giant
commercial
tapeworm
the
feeling
is
exacerbated
by
the
lack
of
side
roads
with
nowhere
to
go
but
forward
traffic
moves
in
lurches
yards
ahead
a
light
turns
green
by
the
time
we
are
moving
the
light
is
yellow
again
for
stallman
a
lifetime
resident
of
the
east
coast
the
prospect
of
spending
the
better
part
of
a
sunny
hawaiian
afternoon
trapped
in
slow
traffic
is
enough
to
trigger
an
embolism
even
worse
is
the
knowledge
that
with
just
a
few
quick
right
turns
a
quarter
mile
back
this
whole
situation
easily
could
have
been
avoided
unfortunately
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
driver
ahead
of
us
a
programmer
from
the
lab
who
knows
the
way
and
who
has
decided
to
take
us
to
via
the
scenic
route
instead
of
via
the
nearby
pilani
highway
this
is
terrible
says
stallman
between
frustrated
sighs
why
did
we
take
the
other
route
again
the
light
a
quarter
mile
ahead
of
us
turns
green
again
we
creep
forward
a
few
more
car
lengths
this
process
continues
for
another
minutes
until
we
finally
reach
a
major
crossroad
promising
access
to
the
adjacent
highway
the
driver
ahead
of
us
ignores
it
and
continues
through
the
intersection
why
is
he
turning
moans
stallman
throwing
up
his
hands
in
frustration
can
you
believe
this
i
decide
not
to
answer
either
i
find
the
fact
that
i
am
sitting
in
a
car
with
stallman
in
the
driver
seat
in
maui
no
less
unbelievable
enough
until
two
hours
ago
i
did
even
know
stallman
knew
how
to
drive
now
listening
to
ma
cello
playing
the
mournful
bass
notes
of
appalachian
journey
on
the
car
stereo
and
watching
the
sunset
pass
by
on
our
left
i
do
my
best
to
fade
into
the
upholstery
when
the
next
opportunity
to
turn
finally
comes
up
stallman
hits
his
right
turn
signal
in
an
attempt
to
cue
the
driver
ahead
of
us
no
such
luck
once
again
we
creep
slowly
through
the
intersection
coming
to
a
stop
a
good
yards
before
the
next
light
by
now
stallman
is
livid
it
like
he
deliberately
ignoring
us
he
says
gesturing
and
pantomiming
like
an
air
craft
carrier
officer
in
a
futile
attempt
to
catch
our
guide
eye
the
guide
appears
unfazed
and
for
the
next
five
minutes
all
we
see
is
a
small
portion
of
his
head
in
the
rearview
mirror
i
look
out
stallman
window
nearby
kahoolawe
and
lanai
islands
provide
an
ideal
frame
for
the
setting
sun
it
a
breathtaking
view
the
kind
that
makes
moments
like
this
a
bit
more
bearable
if
you
a
hawaiian
native
i
suppose
i
try
to
direct
attention
to
it
but
stallman
by
now
obsessed
by
the
inattentiveness
of
the
driver
ahead
of
us
blows
me
off
when
the
driver
passes
through
another
green
light
completely
ignoring
a
pilani
highway
next
right
i
grit
my
teeth
i
remember
an
early
warning
relayed
to
me
by
bsd
programmer
keith
bostic
stallman
does
not
suffer
fools
gladly
bostic
warned
me
if
somebody
says
or
does
something
stupid
he
look
them
in
the
eye
and
say
stupid
looking
at
the
oblivious
driver
ahead
of
us
i
realize
that
it
the
stupidity
not
the
inconvenience
killing
stallman
right
now
it
as
if
he
picked
this
route
with
absolutely
no
thought
on
how
to
get
there
efficiently
stallman
says
the
word
efficiently
hangs
in
the
air
like
a
bad
odor
few
things
irritate
the
hacker
mind
more
than
inefficiency
it
was
the
inefficiency
of
checking
the
xerox
laser
printer
two
or
three
times
a
day
that
triggered
stallman
initial
inquiry
into
the
printer
source
code
it
was
the
inefficiency
of
rewriting
software
tools
hijacked
by
commercial
software
vendors
that
led
stallman
to
battle
symbolics
and
to
launch
the
gnu
project
if
as
jean
paul
sartre
once
opined
hell
is
other
people
hacker
hell
is
duplicating
other
people
stupid
mistakes
and
it
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
stallman
entire
life
has
been
an
attempt
to
save
mankind
from
these
fiery
depths
this
hell
metaphor
becomes
all
the
more
apparent
as
we
take
in
the
slowly
passing
scenery
with
its
multitude
of
shops
parking
lots
and
poorly
timed
street
lights
kihei
seems
less
like
a
city
and
more
like
a
poorly
designed
software
program
writ
large
instead
of
rerouting
traffic
and
distributing
vehicles
through
side
streets
and
expressways
city
planners
have
elected
to
run
everything
through
a
single
main
drag
from
a
hacker
perspective
sitting
in
a
car
amidst
all
this
mess
is
like
listening
to
a
cd
rendition
of
nails
on
a
chalkboard
at
full
volume
imperfect
systems
infuriate
hackers
observes
steven
levy
another
warning
i
should
have
listened
to
before
climbing
into
the
car
with
stallman
this
is
one
reason
why
hackers
generally
hate
driving
system
of
randomly
programmed
red
lights
and
oddly
laid
out
streets
causes
delays
which
are
so
goddamn
unnecessary
levy
emphasis
that
the
impulse
is
to
rearrange
signs
open
up
control
boxes
redesign
the
entire
system
see
steven
levy
hackers

paperback
more
frustrating
however
is
the
duplicity
of
our
trusted
guide
instead
of
searching
out
a
clever
any
true
hacker
would
do
on
driver
ahead
of
us
has
instead
chosen
to
play
along
with
the
city
planners
game
like
virgil
in
inferno
our
guide
is
determined
to
give
us
the
full
guided
tour
of
this
hacker
hell
whether
we
want
it
or
not
before
i
can
make
this
observation
to
stallman
the
driver
finally
hits
his
right
turn
signal
hunched
shoulders
relax
slightly
and
for
a
moment
the
air
of
tension
within
the
car
dissipates
the
tension
comes
back
however
as
the
driver
in
front
of
us
slows
down
construction
ahead
signs
line
both
sides
of
the
street
and
even
though
the
pilani
highway
lies
less
than
a
quarter
mile
off
in
the
distance
the
road
between
us
and
the
highway
is
blocked
by
a
dormant
bulldozer
and
two
large
mounds
of
dirt
it
takes
stallman
a
few
seconds
to
register
going
on
as
our
guide
begins
executing
a
clumsy
in
front
of
us
when
he
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
bulldozer
and
the
no
through
access
signs
just
beyond
stallman
finally
boils
over
why
why
why
he
whines
throwing
his
head
back
you
should
have
known
the
road
was
blocked
you
should
have
known
this
way
would
work
you
did
this
deliberately
the
driver
finishes
the
turn
and
passes
us
on
the
way
back
toward
the
main
drag
as
he
does
so
he
shakes
his
head
and
gives
us
an
apologetic
shrug
coupled
with
a
toothy
grin
the
driver
gesture
reveals
a
touch
of
mainlander
frustration
but
is
tempered
with
a
protective
dose
of
islander
fatalism
coming
through
the
sealed
windows
of
our
rental
car
it
spells
out
a
succinct
message
hey
it
maui
what
are
you
gon
na
do
stallman
can
take
it
no
longer
do
you
fucking
smile
he
shouts
fogging
up
the
glass
as
he
does
so
it
your
fucking
fault
this
all
could
have
been
so
much
easier
if
we
had
just
done
it
my
way
stallman
accents
the
words
my
way
by
gripping
the
steering
wheel
and
pulling
himself
towards
it
twice
the
image
of
stallman
lurching
frame
is
like
that
of
a
child
throwing
a
temper
tantrum
in
a
car
seat
an
image
further
underlined
by
the
tone
of
voice
halfway
between
anger
and
anguish
stallman
seems
to
be
on
the
verge
of
tears
fortunately
the
tears
do
not
arrive
like
a
summer
cloudburst
the
tantrum
ends
almost
as
soon
as
it
begins
after
a
few
whiny
gasps
stallman
shifts
the
car
into
reverse
and
begins
executing
his
own
by
the
time
we
are
back
on
the
main
drag
his
face
is
as
impassive
as
it
was
when
we
left
the
hotel
minutes
earlier
it
takes
less
than
five
minutes
to
reach
the
next
this
one
offers
easy
highway
access
and
within
seconds
we
are
soon
speeding
off
toward
at
a
relaxing
rate
of
speed
the
sun
that
once
loomed
bright
and
yellow
over
stallman
left
shoulder
is
now
burning
a
cool
in
our
rearview
mirror
it
lends
its
color
to
the
gauntlet
wili
wili
trees
flying
past
us
on
both
sides
of
the
highway
for
the
next
minutes
the
only
sound
in
our
vehicle
aside
from
the
ambient
hum
of
the
car
engine
and
tires
is
the
sound
of
a
cello
and
a
violin
trio
playing
the
mournful
strains
of
an
appalachian
folk
tune
endnote
continuing
the
fight
for
richard
stallman
time
may
not
heal
all
wounds
but
it
does
provide
a
convenient
ally
four
years
after
the
cathedral
and
the
bazaar
stallman
still
chafes
over
the
raymond
critique
he
also
grumbles
over
linus
torvalds
elevation
to
the
role
of
world
most
famous
hacker
he
recalls
a
popular
that
began
showing
at
linux
tradeshows
around
designed
to
mimic
the
original
promotional
poster
for
star
wars
the
shirt
depicted
torvalds
brandishing
a
lightsaber
like
luke
skywalker
while
stallman
face
rides
atop
the
shirt
still
grates
on
stallmans
nerves
not
only
because
it
depicts
him
as
a
torvalds
sidekick
but
also
because
it
elevates
torvalds
to
the
leadership
role
in
the
free
source
community
a
role
even
torvalds
himself
is
loath
to
accept
it
ironic
says
stallman
mournfully
picking
up
that
sword
is
exactly
what
linus
refuses
to
do
he
gets
everybody
focusing
on
him
as
the
symbol
of
the
movement
and
then
he
fight
what
good
is
it
then
again
it
is
that
same
unwillingness
to
pick
up
the
sword
on
torvalds
part
that
has
left
the
door
open
for
stallman
to
bolster
his
reputation
as
the
hacker
community
ethical
arbiter
despite
his
grievances
stallman
has
to
admit
that
the
last
few
years
have
been
quite
good
both
to
himself
and
to
his
organization
relegated
to
the
periphery
by
the
unforeseen
success
of
stallman
has
nonetheless
successfully
recaptured
the
initiative
his
speaking
schedule
between
january
and
december
included
stops
on
six
continents
and
visits
to
countries
where
the
notion
of
software
freedom
carries
heavy
and
india
for
example
outside
the
bully
pulpit
stallman
has
also
learned
how
to
leverage
his
power
as
costeward
of
the
gnu
general
public
license
gpl
during
the
summer
of
while
the
air
was
rapidly
leaking
out
of
the
linux
ipo
bubble
stallman
and
the
free
software
foundation
scored
two
major
victories
in
july
troll
tech
a
norwegian
software
company
and
developer
of
qt
a
valuable
suite
of
graphics
tools
for
the
operating
system
announced
it
was
licensing
its
software
under
the
gpl
a
few
weeks
later
sun
microsystems
a
company
that
until
then
had
been
warily
trying
to
ride
the
open
source
bandwagon
without
giving
up
total
control
of
its
software
properties
finally
relented
and
announced
that
it
too
was
dual
licensing
its
new
openoffice
application
suite
under
the
lesser
gnu
public
license
lgpl
and
the
sun
industry
standards
source
license
sissl
underlining
each
victory
was
the
fact
that
stallman
had
done
little
to
fight
for
them
in
the
case
of
troll
tech
stallman
had
simply
played
the
role
of
free
software
pontiff
in
the
company
had
come
up
with
a
license
that
met
the
conditions
laid
out
by
the
free
software
foundation
but
in
examining
the
license
further
stallman
detected
legal
incompatibles
that
would
make
it
impossible
to
bundle
qt
with
software
programs
tired
of
battling
stallman
troll
tech
management
finally
decided
to
split
the
qt
into
two
versions
one
and
one
giving
developers
a
way
around
the
compatibility
issues
cited
by
stallman
in
the
case
of
sun
they
desired
to
play
according
to
the
free
software
foundation
conditions
at
the
open
source
conference
sun
microsystems
cofounder
and
chief
scientist
bill
joy
defended
his
company
community
source
license
essentially
a
compromise
letting
users
copy
and
modify
software
but
not
charge
a
fee
for
said
software
without
negotiating
a
royalty
agreement
with
sun
a
year
after
joy
speech
sun
microsystems
vice
president
marco
boerries
was
appearing
on
the
same
stage
spelling
out
the
company
new
licensing
compromise
in
the
case
of
openoffice
an
suite
designed
specifically
for
the
operating
system
i
can
spell
it
out
in
three
letters
said
boerries
gpl
at
the
time
boerries
said
his
company
decision
had
little
to
do
with
stallman
and
more
to
do
with
the
momentum
of
programs
what
basically
happened
was
the
recognition
that
different
products
attracted
different
communities
and
the
license
you
use
depends
on
what
type
of
community
you
want
to
attract
said
boerries
with
openoffice
it
was
clear
we
had
the
highest
correlation
with
the
gpl
community
see
marco
boerries
interview
with
author
july
such
comments
point
out
the
strength
of
the
gpl
and
indirectly
the
political
genius
of
man
who
played
the
largest
role
in
creating
it
there
is
a
lawyer
on
earth
who
would
have
drafted
the
gpl
the
way
it
is
says
eben
moglen
columbia
university
law
professor
and
free
software
foundation
general
counsel
but
it
works
and
it
works
because
of
richard
philosophy
of
design
a
former
professional
programmer
moglen
traces
his
pro
bono
work
with
stallman
back
to
when
stallman
requested
moglen
legal
assistance
on
a
private
affair
moglen
then
working
with
encryption
expert
phillip
zimmerman
during
zimmerman
legal
battles
with
the
national
security
administration
says
he
was
honored
by
the
request
i
told
him
i
used
emacs
every
day
of
my
life
and
it
would
take
an
awful
lot
of
lawyering
on
my
part
to
pay
off
the
debt
since
then
moglen
perhaps
more
than
any
other
individual
has
had
the
best
chance
to
observe
the
crossover
of
stallman
hacker
philosophies
into
the
legal
realm
moglen
says
the
difference
between
stallman
approach
to
legal
code
and
software
code
are
largely
the
same
i
have
to
say
as
a
lawyer
the
idea
that
what
you
should
do
with
a
legal
document
is
to
take
out
all
the
bugs
does
make
much
sense
moglen
says
there
is
uncertainty
in
every
legal
process
and
what
most
lawyers
want
to
do
is
to
capture
the
benefits
of
uncertainty
for
their
client
richard
goal
is
the
complete
opposite
his
goal
is
to
remove
uncertainty
which
is
inherently
impossible
it
is
inherently
impossible
to
draft
one
license
to
control
all
circumstances
in
all
legal
systems
all
over
the
world
but
if
you
were
to
go
at
it
you
would
have
to
go
at
it
his
way
and
the
resulting
elegance
the
resulting
simplicity
in
design
almost
achieves
what
it
has
to
achieve
and
from
there
a
little
lawyering
will
carry
you
quite
far
as
the
person
charged
with
pushing
the
stallman
agenda
moglen
understands
the
frustration
of
allies
richard
is
a
man
who
does
not
want
to
compromise
over
matters
that
he
thinks
of
as
fundamental
moglen
says
and
he
does
not
take
easily
the
twisting
of
words
or
even
just
the
seeking
of
artful
ambiguity
which
human
society
often
requires
from
a
lot
of
people
because
of
the
free
software
foundation
unwillingness
to
weigh
in
on
issues
outside
the
purview
of
gnu
development
and
gpl
enforcement
moglen
has
taken
to
devoting
his
excess
energies
to
assisting
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
the
organization
providing
legal
aid
to
recent
copyright
defendants
such
as
dmitri
skylarov
in
moglen
also
served
as
direct
counsel
to
a
collection
of
hackers
that
were
joined
together
from
circulating
the
dvd
decryption
program
decss
despite
the
silence
of
his
main
client
in
both
cases
moglen
has
learned
to
appreciate
the
value
of
stallman
stubbornness
there
have
been
times
over
the
years
where
i
gone
to
richard
and
said
have
to
do
this
we
have
to
do
that
the
strategic
situation
here
the
next
move
what
he
have
to
do
and
richard
response
has
always
been
do
have
to
do
anything
just
wait
what
needs
doing
will
get
done
and
you
know
what
moglen
adds
generally
he
been
right
such
comments
disavow
stallman
own
i
not
good
at
playing
games
stallman
says
addressing
the
many
unseen
critics
who
see
him
as
a
shrewd
strategist
i
not
good
at
looking
ahead
and
anticipating
what
somebody
else
might
do
my
approach
has
always
been
to
focus
on
the
foundation
to
say
make
the
foundation
as
strong
as
we
can
make
it
the
gpl
expanding
popularity
and
continuing
gravitational
strength
are
the
best
tributes
to
the
foundation
laid
by
stallman
and
his
gnu
colleagues
while
no
longer
capable
of
billing
himself
as
the
last
true
hacker
stallman
nevertheless
can
take
sole
credit
for
building
the
free
software
ethical
framework
whether
or
not
other
modern
programmers
feel
comfortable
working
inside
that
framework
is
immaterial
the
fact
that
they
even
have
a
choice
at
all
is
stallman
greatest
legacy
discussing
stallman
legacy
at
this
point
seems
a
bit
premature
stallman
at
the
time
of
this
writing
still
has
a
few
years
left
to
add
to
or
subtract
from
that
legacy
still
the
autopilot
nature
of
the
free
software
movement
makes
it
tempting
to
examine
stallman
life
outside
the
battles
of
the
software
industry
and
within
a
more
august
historical
setting
to
his
credit
stallman
refuses
all
opportunities
to
speculate
i
never
been
able
to
work
out
detailed
plans
of
what
the
future
was
going
to
be
like
says
stallman
offering
his
own
premature
epitaph
i
just
said
going
to
fight
who
knows
where
i
get
there
no
question
that
in
picking
his
fights
stallman
has
alienated
the
very
people
who
might
otherwise
have
been
his
greatest
champions
it
is
also
a
testament
to
his
forthright
ethical
nature
that
many
of
stallman
erstwhile
political
opponents
still
manage
to
put
in
a
few
good
words
for
him
when
pressed
the
tension
between
stallman
the
ideologue
and
stallman
the
hacker
genius
however
leads
a
biographer
to
wonder
how
will
people
view
stallman
when
own
personality
is
no
longer
there
to
get
in
the
way
in
early
drafts
of
this
book
i
dubbed
this
question
the
year
question
hoping
to
stimulate
an
objective
view
of
stallman
and
his
work
i
asked
various
luminaries
to
take
themselves
out
of
the
current
timeframe
and
put
themselves
in
a
position
of
a
historian
looking
back
on
the
free
software
movement
years
in
the
future
from
the
current
vantage
point
it
is
easy
to
see
similarities
between
stallman
and
past
americans
who
while
somewhat
marginal
during
their
lifetime
have
attained
heightened
historical
importance
in
relation
to
their
age
easy
comparisons
include
henry
david
thoreau
transcendentalist
philosopher
and
author
of
on
civil
disobedience
and
john
muir
founder
of
the
sierra
club
and
progenitor
of
the
modern
environmental
movement
it
is
also
easy
to
see
similarities
in
men
like
william
jennings
bryan
the
great
commoner
leader
of
the
populist
movement
enemy
of
monopolies
and
a
man
who
though
powerful
seems
to
have
faded
into
historical
insignificance
although
not
the
first
person
to
view
software
as
public
property
stallman
is
guaranteed
a
footnote
in
future
history
books
thanks
to
the
gpl
given
that
fact
it
seems
worthwhile
to
step
back
and
examine
richard
stallman
legacy
outside
the
current
time
frame
will
the
gpl
still
be
something
software
programmers
use
in
the
year
or
will
it
have
long
since
fallen
by
the
wayside
will
the
term
free
software
seem
as
politically
quaint
as
free
silver
does
today
or
will
it
seem
eerily
prescient
in
light
of
later
political
events
predicting
the
future
is
risky
sport
but
most
people
when
presented
with
the
question
seemed
eager
to
bite
one
hundred
years
from
now
richard
and
a
couple
of
other
people
are
going
to
deserve
more
than
a
footnote
says
moglen
they
going
to
be
viewed
as
the
main
line
of
the
story
the
couple
other
people
moglen
nominates
for
future
textbook
chapters
include
john
gilmore
stallman
gpl
advisor
and
future
founder
of
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
and
theodor
holm
nelson
ted
nelson
author
of
the
book
literary
machines
moglen
says
stallman
nelson
and
gilmore
each
stand
out
in
historically
significant
nonoverlapping
ways
he
credits
nelson
commonly
considered
to
have
coined
the
term
hypertext
for
identifying
the
predicament
of
information
ownership
in
the
digital
age
gilmore
and
stallman
meanwhile
earn
notable
credit
for
identifying
the
negative
political
effects
of
information
control
and
building
electronic
frontier
foundation
in
the
case
of
gilmore
and
the
free
software
foundation
in
the
case
of
counteract
those
effects
of
the
two
however
moglen
sees
stallman
activities
as
more
personal
and
less
political
in
nature
richard
was
unique
in
that
the
ethical
implications
of
unfree
software
were
particularly
clear
to
him
at
an
early
moment
says
moglen
this
has
a
lot
to
do
with
richard
personality
which
lots
of
people
will
when
writing
about
him
try
to
depict
as
epiphenomenal
or
even
a
drawback
in
richard
stallman
own
life
work
gilmore
who
describes
his
inclusion
between
the
erratic
nelson
and
the
irascible
stallman
as
something
of
a
mixed
honor
nevertheless
seconds
the
moglen
argument
writes
gilmore
my
guess
is
that
writings
will
stand
up
as
well
as
thomas
have
he
a
pretty
clear
writer
and
also
clear
on
his
principles
whether
richard
will
be
as
influential
as
jefferson
will
depend
on
whether
the
abstractions
we
call
civil
rights
end
up
more
important
a
hundred
years
from
now
than
the
abstractions
that
we
call
software
or
technically
imposed
restrictions
another
element
of
the
stallman
legacy
not
to
be
overlooked
gilmore
writes
is
the
collaborative
model
pioneered
by
the
gnu
project
although
flawed
at
times
the
model
has
nevertheless
evolved
into
a
standard
within
the
industry
all
told
gilmore
says
this
collaborative
model
may
end
up
being
even
more
influential
than
the
gnu
project
the
gpl
license
or
any
particular
software
program
developed
by
stallman
before
the
internet
it
was
quite
hard
to
collaborate
over
distance
on
software
even
among
teams
that
know
and
trust
each
other
richard
pioneered
collaborative
development
of
software
particularly
by
disorganized
volunteers
who
seldom
meet
each
other
richard
did
build
any
of
the
basic
tools
for
doing
this
the
tcp
protocol
email
lists
diff
and
patch
tar
files
rcs
or
cvs
or
but
he
used
the
ones
that
were
available
to
form
social
groups
of
programmers
who
could
effectively
collaborate
lawrence
lessig
stanford
law
professor
and
author
of
the
book
the
future
of
ideas
is
similarly
bullish
like
many
legal
scholars
lessig
sees
the
gpl
as
a
major
bulwark
of
the
current
digital
commons
the
vast
agglomeration
of
software
programs
network
and
telecommunication
standards
that
have
triggered
the
internet
exponential
growth
over
the
last
three
decades
rather
than
connect
stallman
with
other
internet
pioneers
men
such
as
vannevar
bush
vinton
cerf
and
licklider
who
convinced
others
to
see
computer
technology
on
a
wider
scale
lessig
sees
stallman
impact
as
more
personal
introspective
and
ultimately
unique
stallman
changed
the
debate
from
is
to
ought
he
made
people
see
how
much
was
at
stake
and
he
built
a
device
to
carry
these
ideals
forward
that
said
i
do
quite
know
how
to
place
him
in
the
context
of
cerf
or
licklider
the
innovation
is
different
it
is
not
just
about
a
certain
kind
of
code
or
enabling
the
internet
it
much
more
about
getting
people
to
see
the
value
in
a
certain
kind
of
internet
i
do
think
there
is
anyone
else
in
that
class
before
or
after
not
everybody
sees
the
stallman
legacy
as
set
in
stone
of
course
eric
raymond
the
open
source
proponent
who
feels
that
leadership
role
has
diminished
significantly
since
sees
mixed
signals
when
looking
into
the
crystal
ball
i
think
stallman
artifacts
gpl
emacs
gcc
will
be
seen
as
revolutionary
works
as
of
the
information
world
i
think
history
will
be
less
kind
to
some
of
the
theories
from
which
rms
operated
and
not
kind
at
all
to
his
personal
tendency
towards
territorial
behavior
as
for
stallman
himself
he
too
sees
mixed
signals
what
history
says
about
the
gnu
project
twenty
years
from
now
will
depend
on
who
wins
the
battle
of
freedom
to
use
public
knowledge
if
we
lose
we
will
be
just
a
footnote
if
we
win
it
is
uncertain
whether
people
will
know
the
role
of
the
gnu
operating
they
think
the
system
is
linux
they
will
build
a
false
picture
of
what
happened
and
why
but
even
if
we
win
what
history
people
learn
a
hundred
years
from
now
is
likely
to
depend
on
who
dominates
politically
searching
for
his
own
historical
analogy
stallman
summons
the
figure
of
john
brown
the
militant
abolitionist
regarded
as
a
hero
on
one
side
of
the
mason
dixon
line
and
a
madman
on
the
other
john
brown
slave
revolt
never
got
going
but
during
his
subsequent
trial
he
effectively
roused
national
demand
for
abolition
during
the
civil
war
john
brown
was
a
hero
years
after
and
for
much
of
the
history
textbooks
taught
that
he
was
crazy
during
the
era
of
legal
segregation
while
bigotry
was
shameless
the
us
partly
accepted
the
story
that
the
south
wanted
to
tell
about
itself
and
history
textbooks
said
many
untrue
things
about
the
civil
war
and
related
events
such
comparisons
document
both
the
peripheral
nature
of
stallman
current
work
and
the
binary
nature
of
his
current
reputation
although
hard
to
see
stallman
reputation
falling
to
the
level
of
infamy
as
brown
did
during
the
despite
his
occasional
analogies
has
done
little
to
inspire
easy
to
envision
a
future
in
which
stallman
ideas
wind
up
on
the
in
fashioning
the
free
software
cause
not
as
a
mass
movement
but
as
a
collection
of
private
battles
against
the
forces
of
proprietary
temptation
stallman
seems
to
have
created
a
unwinnable
situation
especially
for
the
many
acolytes
with
the
same
stubborn
will
then
again
it
is
that
very
will
that
may
someday
prove
to
be
stallman
greatest
lasting
legacy
moglen
a
close
observer
over
the
last
decade
warns
those
who
mistake
the
stallman
personality
as
or
epiphenomenal
to
the
artifacts
of
life
without
that
personality
moglen
says
there
would
be
precious
few
artifiacts
to
discuss
says
moglen
a
former
supreme
court
clerk
look
the
greatest
man
i
ever
worked
for
was
thurgood
marshall
i
knew
what
made
him
a
great
man
i
knew
why
he
had
been
able
to
change
the
world
in
his
possible
way
i
would
be
going
out
on
a
limb
a
little
bit
if
i
were
to
make
a
comparison
because
they
could
not
be
more
different
thurgood
marshall
was
a
man
in
society
representing
an
outcast
society
to
the
society
that
enclosed
it
but
still
a
man
in
society
his
skill
was
social
skills
but
he
was
all
of
a
piece
too
different
as
they
were
in
every
other
respect
that
the
person
i
most
now
compare
him
to
in
that
sense
all
of
a
piece
compact
made
of
the
substance
that
makes
stars
all
the
way
through
is
stallman
in
an
effort
to
drive
that
image
home
moglen
reflects
on
a
shared
moment
in
the
spring
of
the
success
of
the
va
linux
ipo
was
still
resonating
in
the
business
media
and
a
half
dozen
free
issues
were
swimming
through
the
news
surrounded
by
a
swirling
hurricane
of
issues
and
stories
each
begging
for
comment
moglen
recalls
sitting
down
for
lunch
with
stallman
and
feeling
like
a
castaway
dropped
into
the
eye
of
the
storm
for
the
next
hour
he
says
the
conversation
calmly
revolved
around
a
single
topic
strengthening
the
gpl
we
were
sitting
there
talking
about
what
we
were
going
to
do
about
some
problems
in
eastern
europe
and
what
we
were
going
to
do
when
the
problem
of
the
ownership
of
content
began
to
threaten
free
software
moglen
recalls
as
we
were
talking
i
briefly
thought
about
how
we
must
have
looked
to
people
passing
by
here
we
are
these
two
little
bearded
anarchists
plotting
and
planning
the
next
steps
and
of
course
richard
is
plucking
the
knots
from
his
hair
and
dropping
them
in
the
soup
and
behaving
in
his
usual
way
anybody
listening
in
on
our
conversation
would
have
thought
we
were
crazy
but
i
knew
i
knew
the
revolution
right
here
at
this
table
this
is
what
making
it
happen
and
this
man
is
the
person
making
it
happen
moglen
says
that
moment
more
than
any
other
drove
home
the
elemental
simplicity
of
the
stallman
style
it
was
funny
recalls
moglen
i
said
to
him
you
know
you
and
i
are
the
two
guys
who
did
make
any
money
out
of
this
revolution
and
then
i
paid
for
the
lunch
because
i
knew
he
did
have
the
money
to
pay
for
it
endnote
epilogue
crushing
loneliness
writing
the
biography
of
a
living
person
is
a
bit
like
producing
a
play
the
drama
in
front
of
the
curtain
often
pales
in
comparison
to
the
drama
backstage
in
the
autobiography
of
malcolm
x
alex
haley
gives
readers
a
rare
glimpse
of
that
backstage
drama
stepping
out
of
the
ghostwriter
role
haley
delivers
the
book
epilogue
in
his
own
voice
the
epilogue
explains
how
a
freelance
reporter
originally
dismissed
as
a
tool
and
spy
by
the
nation
of
islam
spokesperson
managed
to
work
through
personal
and
political
barriers
to
get
malcolm
x
life
story
on
paper
while
i
hesitate
to
compare
this
book
with
the
autobiography
of
malcolm
x
i
do
owe
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
haley
for
his
candid
epilogue
over
the
last
months
it
has
served
as
a
sort
of
instruction
manual
on
how
to
deal
with
a
biographical
subject
who
has
built
an
entire
career
on
being
disagreeable
from
the
outset
i
envisioned
closing
this
biography
with
a
similar
epilogue
both
as
an
homage
to
haley
and
as
a
way
to
let
readers
know
how
this
book
came
to
be
the
story
behind
this
story
starts
in
an
oakland
apartment
winding
its
way
through
the
various
locales
mentioned
in
the
valley
maui
boston
and
cambridge
ultimately
however
it
is
a
tale
of
two
cities
new
york
new
york
the
capital
of
the
world
and
sebastopol
california
the
capital
of
sonoma
county
the
story
starts
in
april
at
the
time
i
was
writing
stories
for
the
beopen
web
site
http
one
of
my
first
assignments
was
a
phone
interview
with
richard
stallman
the
interview
went
well
so
well
that
slashdot
http
the
popular
news
for
nerds
site
owned
by
va
software
formerly
va
linux
systems
and
before
that
va
research
gave
it
a
link
in
its
daily
list
of
feature
stories
within
hours
the
web
servers
at
beopen
were
heating
up
as
readers
clicked
over
to
the
site
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
story
should
have
ended
there
three
months
after
the
interview
while
attending
the
open
source
conference
in
monterey
california
i
received
the
following
email
message
from
tracy
pattison
manager
at
a
large
new
york
publishing
house
to
sam
subject
rms
interviewdate
mon
jul
williams
i
read
your
interview
with
richard
stallman
on
beopen
with
great
interest
i
been
intrigued
by
rms
and
his
work
for
some
time
now
and
was
delighted
to
find
your
piece
which
i
really
think
you
did
a
great
job
of
capturing
some
of
the
spirit
of
what
stallman
is
trying
to
do
with
and
the
free
software
foundation
what
i
love
to
do
however
is
read
more
and
i
do
think
i
alone
do
you
think
there
is
more
information
sources
out
there
to
expand
and
update
your
interview
and
adapt
it
into
more
of
a
profile
of
stallman
perhaps
including
some
more
anecdotal
information
about
his
personality
and
background
that
might
really
interest
and
enlighten
readers
outside
the
more
hardcore
programming
scene
the
email
asked
that
i
give
tracy
a
call
to
discuss
the
idea
further
i
did
just
that
tracy
told
me
her
company
was
launching
a
new
electronic
book
line
and
it
wanted
stories
that
appealed
to
an
audience
the
format
was
words
about
pages
and
she
had
pitched
her
bosses
on
the
idea
of
profiling
a
major
figure
in
the
hacker
community
her
bosses
liked
the
idea
and
in
the
process
of
searching
for
interesting
people
to
profile
she
had
come
across
my
beopen
interview
with
stallman
hence
her
email
to
me
that
when
tracy
asked
me
would
i
be
willing
to
expand
the
interview
into
a
feature
profile
my
answer
was
instant
yes
before
accepting
it
tracy
suggested
i
put
together
a
story
proposal
she
could
show
her
superiors
two
days
later
i
sent
her
a
polished
proposal
a
week
later
tracy
sent
me
a
follow
up
email
her
bosses
had
given
it
the
green
light
i
have
to
admit
getting
stallman
to
participate
in
an
project
was
an
afterthought
on
my
part
as
a
reporter
who
covered
the
open
source
beat
i
knew
stallman
was
a
stickler
i
already
received
a
half
dozen
emails
at
that
point
upbraiding
me
for
the
use
of
linux
instead
of
then
again
i
also
knew
stallman
was
looking
for
ways
to
get
his
message
out
to
the
general
public
perhaps
if
i
presented
the
project
to
him
that
way
he
would
be
more
receptive
if
not
i
could
always
rely
upon
the
copious
amounts
of
documents
interviews
and
recorded
online
conversations
stallman
had
left
lying
around
the
internet
and
do
an
unauthorized
biography
during
my
research
i
came
across
an
essay
titled
copyright
written
by
stallman
and
published
in
the
june
edition
of
the
mit
technology
review
the
essay
blasted
for
an
assortment
of
software
sins
not
only
did
readers
have
to
use
proprietary
software
programs
to
read
them
stallman
lamented
but
the
methods
used
to
prevent
unauthorized
copying
were
overly
harsh
instead
of
downloading
a
transferable
html
or
pdf
file
readers
downloaded
an
encrypted
file
in
essence
purchasing
an
meant
purchasing
a
nontransferable
key
to
unscramble
the
encrypted
content
any
attempt
to
open
a
book
content
without
an
authorized
key
constituted
a
criminal
violation
of
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
the
law
designed
to
bolster
copyright
enforcement
on
the
internet
similar
penalties
held
for
readers
who
converted
a
book
content
into
an
open
file
format
even
if
their
only
intention
was
to
read
the
book
on
a
different
computer
in
their
home
unlike
a
normal
book
the
reader
no
longer
held
the
right
to
lend
copy
or
resell
an
they
only
had
the
right
to
read
it
on
an
authorized
machine
warned
stallman
we
still
have
the
same
old
freedoms
in
using
paper
books
but
if
replace
printed
books
that
exception
will
do
little
good
with
electronic
ink
which
makes
it
possible
to
download
new
text
onto
an
apparently
printed
piece
of
paper
even
newspapers
could
become
ephemeral
imagine
no
more
used
book
stores
no
more
lending
a
book
to
your
friend
no
more
borrowing
one
from
the
public
more
leaks
that
might
give
someone
a
chance
to
read
without
paying
and
judging
from
the
ads
for
microsoft
reader
no
more
anonymous
purchasing
of
books
either
this
is
the
world
publishers
have
in
mind
for
safari
tech
books
online
subscriber
agreement
terms
of
service
http
needless
to
say
the
essay
caused
some
concern
neither
tracy
nor
i
had
discussed
the
software
her
company
would
use
nor
had
we
discussed
the
type
of
copyright
that
would
govern
the
usage
i
mentioned
the
technology
review
article
and
asked
if
she
could
give
me
information
on
her
company
policies
tracy
promised
to
get
back
to
me
eager
to
get
started
i
decided
to
call
stallman
anyway
and
mention
the
book
idea
to
him
when
i
did
he
expressed
immediate
interest
and
immediate
concern
did
you
read
my
essay
on
he
asked
when
i
told
him
yes
i
had
read
the
essay
and
was
waiting
to
hear
back
from
the
publisher
stallman
laid
out
two
conditions
he
did
want
to
lend
support
to
an
licensing
mechanism
he
fundamentally
opposed
and
he
did
want
to
come
off
as
lending
support
i
do
want
to
participate
in
anything
that
makes
me
look
like
a
hypocrite
he
said
for
stallman
the
software
issue
was
secondary
to
the
copyright
issue
he
said
he
was
willing
to
ignore
whatever
software
the
publisher
or
its
vendors
employed
just
so
long
as
the
company
specified
within
the
copyright
that
readers
were
free
to
make
and
distribute
verbatim
copies
of
the
content
stallman
pointed
to
stephen
king
the
plant
as
a
possible
model
in
june
king
announced
on
his
official
web
site
that
he
was
the
plant
in
serial
form
according
to
the
announcement
the
book
total
cost
would
be
spread
out
over
a
series
of
installments
as
long
as
at
least
of
the
readers
paid
for
each
chapter
king
promised
to
continue
releasing
new
installments
by
august
the
plan
seemed
to
be
working
as
king
had
published
the
first
two
chapters
with
a
third
on
the
way
i
be
willing
to
accept
something
like
that
stallman
said
as
long
as
it
also
permitted
verbatim
copying
i
forwarded
the
information
to
tracy
feeling
confident
that
she
and
i
might
be
able
to
work
out
an
equitable
arrangement
i
called
up
stallman
and
set
up
the
first
interview
for
the
book
stallman
agreed
to
the
interview
without
making
a
second
inquiry
into
the
status
issue
shortly
after
the
first
interview
i
raced
to
set
up
a
second
interview
this
one
in
kihei
squeezing
it
in
before
stallman
headed
off
on
a
vacation
to
tahiti
it
was
during
stallman
vacation
that
the
bad
news
came
from
tracy
her
company
legal
department
want
to
adjust
its
copyright
notice
on
the
readers
who
wanted
to
make
their
books
transferable
would
either
have
to
crack
the
encryption
code
or
convert
the
book
to
an
open
format
such
as
html
either
way
the
would
be
breaking
the
law
and
facing
criminal
penalties
with
two
fresh
interviews
under
my
belt
i
did
see
any
way
to
write
the
book
without
resorting
to
the
new
material
i
quickly
set
up
a
trip
to
new
york
to
meet
with
my
agent
and
with
tracy
to
see
if
there
was
a
compromise
solution
when
i
flew
to
new
york
i
met
my
agent
henning
guttman
it
was
our
first
meeting
and
henning
seemed
pessimistic
about
our
chances
of
forcing
a
compromise
at
least
on
the
publisher
end
the
large
established
publishing
houses
already
viewed
the
format
with
enough
suspicion
and
were
in
the
mood
to
experiment
with
copyright
language
that
made
it
easier
for
readers
to
avoid
payment
as
an
agent
who
specialized
in
technology
books
however
henning
was
intrigued
by
the
novel
nature
of
my
predicament
i
told
him
about
the
two
interviews
i
already
gathered
and
the
promise
not
to
publish
the
book
in
a
way
that
made
stallman
look
like
a
hypocrite
agreeing
that
i
was
in
an
ethical
bind
henning
suggested
we
make
that
our
negotiating
point
barring
that
henning
said
we
could
always
take
the
approach
the
carrot
would
be
the
publicity
that
came
with
publishing
an
that
honored
the
hacker
community
internal
ethics
the
stick
would
be
the
risks
associated
with
publishing
an
that
did
nine
months
before
dmitri
skylarov
became
an
internet
cause
celebre
we
knew
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
an
enterprising
programmer
revealed
how
to
hack
we
also
knew
that
a
major
publishing
house
releasing
an
on
richard
stallman
was
the
software
equivalent
of
putting
steal
this
on
the
cover
after
my
meeting
with
henning
i
put
a
call
into
stallman
hoping
to
make
the
carrot
more
enticing
i
discussed
a
number
of
potential
compromises
what
if
the
publisher
released
the
book
content
under
a
split
license
something
similar
to
what
sun
microsystems
had
done
with
open
office
the
free
software
desktop
applications
suite
the
publisher
could
then
release
commercial
versions
of
the
under
a
normal
format
taking
advantage
of
all
the
bells
and
whistles
that
went
with
the
software
while
releasing
the
copyable
version
under
a
less
aesthetically
pleasing
html
format
stallman
told
me
he
did
mind
the
idea
but
he
did
dislike
the
idea
of
making
the
freely
copyable
version
inferior
to
the
restricted
version
besides
he
said
the
idea
was
too
cumbersome
split
licenses
worked
in
the
case
of
sun
open
office
only
because
he
had
no
control
over
the
decision
making
in
this
case
stallman
said
he
did
have
a
way
to
control
the
outcome
he
could
refuse
to
cooperate
i
made
a
few
more
suggestions
with
little
effect
about
the
only
thing
i
could
get
out
of
stallman
was
a
concession
that
the
copyright
restrict
all
forms
of
file
sharing
to
noncommercial
redistribution
before
i
signed
off
stallman
suggested
i
tell
the
publisher
that
i
promised
stallman
that
the
work
would
be
free
i
told
stallman
i
could
agree
to
that
statement
but
that
i
did
view
the
book
as
unfinishable
without
his
cooperation
seemingly
satisfied
stallman
hung
up
with
his
usual
line
happy
hacking
henning
and
i
met
with
tracy
the
next
day
tracy
said
her
company
was
willing
to
publish
copyable
excerpts
in
a
unencrypted
format
but
would
limit
the
excerpts
to
words
henning
informed
her
that
this
would
be
enough
for
me
to
get
around
my
ethical
obligation
to
stallman
tracy
mentioned
her
own
company
contractual
obligation
to
online
vendors
such
as
even
if
the
company
decided
to
open
up
its
content
this
one
time
it
faced
the
risk
of
its
partners
calling
it
a
breach
of
contract
barring
a
change
of
heart
in
the
executive
suite
or
on
the
part
of
stallman
the
decision
was
up
to
me
i
could
use
the
interviews
and
go
against
my
earlier
agreement
with
stallman
or
i
could
plead
journalistic
ethics
and
back
out
of
the
verbal
agreement
to
do
the
book
following
the
meeting
my
agent
and
i
relocated
to
a
pub
on
third
ave
i
used
his
cell
phone
to
call
stallman
leaving
a
message
when
nobody
answered
henning
left
for
a
moment
giving
me
time
to
collect
my
thoughts
when
he
returned
he
was
holding
up
the
cell
phone
it
stallman
henning
said
the
conversation
got
off
badly
from
the
start
i
relayed
tracy
comment
about
the
contractual
obligations
so
stallman
said
bluntly
why
should
i
give
a
damn
about
their
contractual
obligations
because
asking
a
major
publishing
house
to
risk
a
legal
battle
with
its
vendors
over
a
word
is
a
tall
order
i
suggested
do
you
see
stallman
said
that
exactly
why
doing
this
i
want
a
signal
victory
i
want
them
to
make
a
choice
between
freedom
and
business
as
usual
as
the
words
signal
victory
echoed
in
my
head
i
felt
my
attention
wander
momentarily
to
the
passing
foot
traffic
on
the
sidewalk
coming
into
the
bar
i
had
been
pleased
to
notice
that
the
location
was
less
than
half
a
block
away
from
the
street
corner
memorialized
in
the
ramones
song
and
a
song
i
always
enjoyed
playing
in
my
days
as
a
musician
like
the
perpetually
frustrated
street
hustler
depicted
in
that
song
i
could
feel
things
falling
apart
as
quickly
as
they
had
come
together
the
irony
was
palpable
after
weeks
of
gleefully
recording
other
laments
i
found
myself
in
the
position
of
trying
to
pull
off
the
rarest
of
feats
a
richard
stallman
compromise
when
i
continued
hemming
and
hawing
pleading
the
publisher
position
and
revealing
my
growing
sympathy
for
it
stallman
like
an
animal
smelling
blood
attacked
so
that
it
you
just
going
to
screw
me
just
going
to
bend
to
their
will
i
brought
up
the
issue
of
a
again
you
mean
license
stallman
said
curtly
yeah
license
copyright
whatever
i
said
feeling
suddenly
like
a
wounded
tuna
trailing
a
rich
plume
of
plasma
in
the
water
aw
why
did
you
just
fucking
do
what
i
told
you
to
do
he
shouted
i
must
have
been
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
publisher
to
the
very
end
because
in
my
notes
i
managed
to
save
a
final
stallman
chestnut
i
do
care
what
doing
is
evil
i
ca
support
evil
as
soon
as
i
put
the
phone
down
my
agent
slid
a
freshly
poured
guinness
to
me
i
figured
you
might
need
this
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
could
see
you
shaking
there
towards
the
end
i
was
indeed
shaking
the
shaking
would
stop
until
the
guinness
was
more
than
halfway
gone
it
felt
weird
hearing
myself
characterized
as
an
emissary
of
evil
it
felt
weirder
still
knowing
that
three
months
before
i
was
sitting
in
an
oakland
apartment
trying
to
come
up
with
my
next
story
idea
now
i
was
sitting
in
a
part
of
the
world
i
only
known
through
rock
songs
taking
meetings
with
publishing
executives
and
drinking
beer
with
an
agent
i
never
even
laid
eyes
on
until
the
day
before
it
was
all
too
surreal
like
watching
my
life
reflected
back
as
a
movie
montage
about
that
time
my
internal
absurdity
meter
kicked
in
the
initial
shaking
gave
way
to
convulsions
of
laughter
to
my
agent
i
must
have
looked
like
a
another
fragile
author
undergoing
an
untimely
emotional
breakdown
to
me
i
was
just
starting
to
appreciate
the
cynical
beauty
of
my
situation
deal
or
no
deal
i
already
had
the
makings
of
a
pretty
good
story
it
was
only
a
matter
of
finding
a
place
to
tell
it
when
my
laughing
convulsions
finally
subsided
i
held
up
my
drink
in
a
toast
welcome
to
the
front
lines
my
friend
i
said
clinking
pints
with
my
agent
might
as
well
enjoy
it
if
this
story
really
were
a
play
here
where
it
would
take
a
momentary
romantic
interlude
disheartened
by
the
tense
nature
of
our
meeting
tracy
invited
henning
and
i
to
go
out
for
drinks
with
her
and
some
of
her
coworkers
we
left
the
bar
on
third
headed
down
to
the
east
village
and
caught
up
with
tracy
and
her
friends
once
there
i
spoke
with
tracy
careful
to
avoid
shop
talk
our
conversation
was
pleasant
relaxed
before
parting
we
agreed
to
meet
the
next
night
once
again
the
conversation
was
pleasant
so
pleasant
that
the
stallman
became
almost
a
distant
memory
when
i
got
back
to
oakland
i
called
around
to
various
journalist
friends
and
acquaintances
i
recounted
my
predicament
most
upbraided
me
for
giving
up
too
much
ground
to
stallman
in
the
preinterview
negotiation
a
former
professor
suggested
i
ignore
hypocrite
comment
and
just
write
the
story
reporters
who
knew
of
stallman
expressed
sympathy
but
uniformly
offered
the
same
response
your
call
i
decided
to
put
the
book
on
the
back
burner
even
with
the
interviews
i
was
making
much
progress
besides
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
speak
with
tracy
without
running
things
past
henning
first
by
christmas
we
had
traded
visits
she
flying
out
to
the
west
coast
once
me
flying
out
to
new
york
a
second
time
the
day
before
new
year
eve
i
proposed
deciding
which
coast
to
live
on
i
picked
new
york
by
february
i
packed
up
my
laptop
computer
and
all
my
research
notes
related
to
the
stallman
biography
and
we
winged
our
way
to
jfk
airport
tracy
and
i
were
married
on
may
so
much
for
failed
book
deals
during
the
summer
i
began
to
contemplate
turning
my
interview
notes
into
a
magazine
article
ethically
i
felt
in
the
clear
doing
so
since
the
original
interview
terms
said
nothing
about
traditional
print
media
to
be
honest
i
also
felt
a
bit
more
comfortable
writing
about
stallman
after
eight
months
of
radio
silence
since
our
telephone
conversation
in
september
i
only
received
two
emails
from
stallman
both
chastised
me
for
using
linux
instead
of
in
a
pair
of
articles
for
the
web
magazine
upside
today
aside
from
that
i
had
enjoyed
the
silence
in
june
about
a
week
after
the
new
york
university
speech
i
took
a
crack
at
writing
a
story
about
stallman
this
time
the
words
flowed
the
distance
had
helped
restore
my
lost
sense
of
emotional
perspective
i
suppose
in
july
a
full
year
after
the
original
email
from
tracy
i
got
a
call
from
henning
he
told
me
that
associates
a
publishing
house
out
of
sebastopol
california
was
interested
in
the
running
the
stallman
story
as
a
biography
the
news
pleased
me
of
all
the
publishing
houses
in
the
world
the
same
company
that
had
published
eric
raymond
the
cathedral
and
the
bazaar
seemed
the
most
sensitive
to
the
issues
that
had
killed
the
earlier
as
a
reporter
i
had
relied
heavily
on
the
book
open
sources
as
a
historical
reference
i
also
knew
that
various
chapters
of
the
book
including
a
chapter
written
by
stallman
had
been
published
with
copyright
notices
that
permitted
redistribution
such
knowledge
would
come
in
handy
if
the
issue
of
electronic
publication
ever
came
up
again
sure
enough
the
issue
did
come
up
i
learned
through
henning
that
intended
to
publish
the
biography
both
as
a
book
and
as
part
of
its
new
safari
tech
books
online
subscription
service
the
safari
user
license
would
involve
special
henning
warned
but
was
willing
to
allow
for
a
copyright
that
permitted
users
to
copy
and
share
and
the
book
text
regardless
of
medium
basically
as
author
i
had
the
choice
between
two
licenses
the
open
publication
license
or
the
gnu
free
documentation
license
i
checked
out
the
contents
and
background
of
each
license
the
open
publication
license
opl
see
the
open
publication
license
draft
june
http
gives
readers
the
right
to
reproduce
and
distribute
a
work
in
whole
or
in
part
in
any
medium
physical
or
electronic
provided
the
copied
work
retains
the
open
publication
license
it
also
permits
modification
of
a
work
provided
certain
conditions
are
met
finally
the
open
publication
license
includes
a
number
of
options
which
if
selected
by
the
author
can
limit
the
creation
of
substantively
modified
versions
or
derivatives
without
prior
author
approval
the
gnu
free

license
gfdl
see
the
gnu
free

license

http
meanwhile
permits
the
copying
and
distribution
of
a
document
in
any
medium
provided
the
resulting
work
carries
the
same
license
it
also
permits
the
modification
of
a
document
provided
certain
conditions
unlike
the
opl
however
it
does
not
give
authors
the
option
to
restrict
certain
modifications
it
also
does
not
give
authors
the
right
to
reject
modifications
that
might
result
in
a
competitive
book
product
it
does
require
certain
forms
of
and
information
if
a
party
other
than
the
copyright
holder
wishes
to
publish
more
than
copies
of
a
protected
work
however
in
the
course
of
researching
the
licenses
i
also
made
sure
to
visit
the
gnu
project
web
page
titled
various
licenses
and
comments
about
them
see
http
on
that
page
i
found
a
stallman
critique
of
the
open
publication
license
stallman
critique
related
to
the
creation
of
modified
works
and
the
ability
of
an
author
to
select
either
one
of
the
opl
options
to
restrict
modification
if
an
author
did
want
to
select
either
option
it
was
better
to
use
the
gfdl
instead
stallman
noted
since
it
minimized
the
risk
of
the
nonselected
options
popping
up
in
modified
versions
of
a
document
the
importance
of
modification
in
both
licenses
was
a
reflection
of
their
original
to
give
owners
a
chance
to
improve
their
manuals
and
publicize
those
improvements
to
the
rest
of
the
community
since
my
book
was
a
manual
i
had
little
concern
about
the
modification
clause
in
either
license
my
only
concern
was
giving
users
the
freedom
to
exchange
copies
of
the
book
or
make
copies
of
the
content
the
same
freedom
they
would
have
enjoyed
if
they
purchased
a
hardcover
book
deeming
either
license
suitable
for
this
purpose
i
signed
the
contract
when
it
came
to
me
still
the
notion
of
unrestricted
modification
intrigued
me
in
my
early
negotiations
with
tracy
i
had
pitched
the
merits
of
a
license
for
the
content
at
worst
i
said
the
license
would
guarantee
a
lot
of
positive
publicity
for
the
at
best
it
would
encourage
readers
to
participate
in
the
process
as
an
author
i
was
willing
to
let
other
people
amend
my
work
just
so
long
as
my
name
always
got
top
billing
besides
it
might
even
be
interesting
to
watch
the
book
evolve
i
pictured
later
editions
looking
much
like
online
versions
of
the
talmud
my
original
text
in
a
central
column
surrounded
by
illuminating
commentary
in
the
margins
my
idea
drew
inspiration
from
project
xanadu
http
the
legendary
software
concept
originally
conceived
by
ted
nelson
in
during
the
open
source
conference
in
i
had
seen
the
first
demonstration
of
the
project
open
source
offshoot
udanax
and
had
been
wowed
by
the
result
in
one
demonstration
sequence
udanax
displayed
a
parent
document
and
a
derivative
work
in
a
similar
format
with
a
click
of
the
button
the
program
introduced
lines
linking
each
sentence
in
the
parent
to
its
conceptual
offshoot
in
the
derivative
an
biography
of
richard
stallman
did
have
to
be
but
given
such
technological
possibilities
why
not
give
users
a
chance
to
play
around
anybody
willing
to
port
this
book
over
to
udanax
the
free
software
version
of
xanadu
will
receive
enthusiastic
support
from
me
to
find
out
more
about
this
intriguing
technology
visit
http
when
laurie
petrycki
my
editor
at
gave
me
a
choice
between
the
opl
or
the
gfdl
i
indulged
the
fantasy
once
again
by
september
of
the
month
i
signed
the
contract
had
become
almost
a
dead
topic
many
publishing
houses
tracy
included
were
shutting
down
their
imprints
for
lack
of
interest
i
had
to
wonder
if
these
companies
had
treated
not
as
a
form
of
publication
but
as
a
form
of
community
building
would
those
imprints
have
survived
after
i
signed
the
contract
i
notified
stallman
that
the
book
project
was
back
on
i
mentioned
the
choice
was
giving
me
between
the
open
publication
license
and
the
gnu
free
documentation
license
i
told
him
i
was
leaning
toward
the
opl
if
only
for
the
fact
i
saw
no
reason
to
give
competitors
a
chance
to
print
the
same
book
under
a
different
cover
stallman
wrote
back
arguing
in
favor
of
the
gfdl
noting
that
had
already
used
it
several
times
in
the
past
despite
the
events
of
the
past
year
i
suggested
a
deal
i
would
choose
the
gfdl
if
it
gave
me
the
possibility
to
do
more
interviews
and
if
stallman
agreed
to
help
publicize
the
book
stallman
agreed
to
participate
in
more
interviews
but
said
that
his
participation
in
events
would
depend
on
the
content
of
the
book
viewing
this
as
only
fair
i
set
up
an
interview
for
december
in
cambridge
i
set
up
the
interview
to
coincide
with
a
business
trip
my
wife
tracy
was
taking
to
boston
two
days
before
leaving
tracy
suggested
i
invite
stallman
out
to
dinner
after
all
she
said
he
is
the
one
who
brought
us
together
i
sent
an
email
to
stallman
who
promptly
sent
a
return
email
accepting
the
offer
when
i
drove
up
to
boston
the
next
day
i
met
tracy
at
her
hotel
and
hopped
the
t
to
head
over
to
mit
when
we
got
to
tech
square
i
found
stallman
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
just
as
we
knocked
on
the
door
i
hope
you
do
mind
he
said
pulling
the
door
open
far
enough
so
that
tracy
and
i
could
just
barely
hear
stallman
conversational
counterpart
it
was
a
youngish
woman
i
say
named
sarah
i
took
the
liberty
of
inviting
somebody
else
to
have
dinner
with
us
stallman
said
giving
me
the
same
smile
he
gave
me
back
in
that
palo
alto
restaurant
to
be
honest
i
was
too
surprised
the
news
that
stallman
had
a
new
female
friend
had
reached
me
a
few
weeks
before
courtesy
of
stallman
mother
in
fact
they
both
went
to
japan
last
month
when
richard
went
over
to
accept
the
takeda
award
lippman
told
me
at
the
i
did
find
out
about
the
takeda
decision
to
award
stallman
along
with
linus
torvalds
and
ken
sakamura
with
its
award
for
achievement
for
until
after
stallman
had
made
the
trip
to
japan
to
accept
the
award
for
more
information
about
the
award
and
its
accompanying
million
prize
visit
the
takeda
site
http
on
the
way
over
to
the
restaurant
i
learned
the
circumstances
of
sarah
and
richard
first
meeting
interestingly
the
circumstances
were
very
familiar
working
on
her
own
fictional
book
sarah
said
she
heard
about
stallman
and
what
an
interesting
character
he
was
she
promptly
decided
to
create
a
character
in
her
book
on
stallman
and
in
the
interests
of
researching
the
character
set
up
an
interview
with
stallman
things
quickly
went
from
there
the
two
had
been
dating
since
the
beginning
of
she
said
i
really
admired
the
way
richard
built
up
an
entire
political
movement
to
address
an
issue
of
profound
personal
concern
sarah
said
explaining
her
attraction
to
stallman
my
wife
immediately
threw
back
the
question
what
was
the
issue
crushing
loneliness
during
dinner
i
let
the
women
do
the
talking
and
spent
most
of
the
time
trying
to
detect
clues
as
to
whether
the
last
months
had
softened
stallman
in
any
significant
way
i
did
see
anything
to
suggest
they
had
although
more
flirtatious
than
i
flirtatiousness
spoiled
somewhat
by
the
number
of
times
stallman
eyes
seemed
to
fixate
on
my
retained
the
same
general
level
of
prickliness
at
one
point
my
wife
uttered
an
emphatic
god
forbid
only
to
receive
a
typical
stallman
rebuke
i
hate
to
break
it
to
you
but
there
is
no
god
stallman
said
afterwards
when
the
dinner
was
complete
and
sarah
had
departed
stallman
seemed
to
let
his
guard
down
a
little
as
we
walked
to
a
nearby
bookstore
he
admitted
that
the
last
months
had
dramatically
changed
his
outlook
on
life
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
alone
forever
he
said
i
glad
i
was
wrong
before
parting
stallman
handed
me
his
pleasure
card
a
business
card
listing
stallman
address
phone
number
and
favorite
pastimes
sharing
good
books
good
food
and
exotic
music
and
dance
so
that
i
might
set
up
a
final
interview
graphic
file
stallman
pleasure
card
handed
to
me
the
night
of
our
dinner
the
next
day
over
another
meal
of
dim
sum
stallman
seemed
even
more
lovestruck
than
the
night
before
recalling
his
debates
with
currier
house
dorm
maters
over
the
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
an
immortality
serum
stallman
expressed
hope
that
scientists
might
some
day
come
up
with
the
key
to
immortality
now
that
i
finally
starting
to
have
happiness
in
my
life
i
want
to
have
more
he
said
when
i
mentioned
sarah
crushing
loneliness
comment
stallman
failed
to
see
a
connection
between
loneliness
on
a
physical
or
spiritual
level
and
loneliness
on
a
hacker
level
the
impulse
to
share
code
is
about
friendship
but
friendship
at
a
much
lower
level
he
said
later
however
when
the
subject
came
up
again
stallman
did
admit
that
loneliness
or
the
fear
of
perpetual
loneliness
had
played
a
major
role
in
fueling
his
determination
during
the
earliest
days
of
the
gnu
project
my
fascination
with
computers
was
not
a
consequence
of
anything
else
he
said
i
would
have
been
less
fascinated
with
computers
if
i
had
been
popular
and
all
the
women
flocked
to
me
however
it
certainly
true
the
experience
of
feeling
i
did
have
a
home
finding
one
and
losing
it
finding
another
and
having
it
destroyed
affected
me
deeply
the
one
i
lost
was
the
dorm
the
one
that
was
destroyed
was
the
ai
lab
the
precariousness
of
not
having
any
kind
of
home
or
community
was
very
powerful
it
made
me
want
to
fight
to
get
it
back
after
the
interview
i
could
help
but
feel
a
certain
sense
of
emotional
symmetry
hearing
sarah
describe
what
attracted
her
to
stallman
and
hearing
stallman
himself
describe
the
emotions
that
prompted
him
to
take
up
the
free
software
cause
i
was
reminded
of
my
own
reasons
for
writing
this
book
since
july
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
both
the
seductive
and
the
repellent
sides
of
the
richard
stallman
persona
like
eben
moglen
before
me
i
feel
that
dismissing
that
persona
as
epiphenomenal
or
distracting
in
relation
to
the
overall
free
software
movement
would
be
a
grievous
mistake
in
many
ways
the
two
are
so
mutually
defining
as
to
be
indistinguishable
while
i
sure
not
every
reader
feels
the
same
level
of
affinity
for
after
reading
this
book
some
might
feel
zero
sure
most
will
agree
few
individuals
offer
as
singular
a
human
portrait
as
richard
stallman
it
is
my
sincere
hope
that
with
this
initial
portrait
complete
and
with
the
help
of
the
gfdl
others
will
feel
a
similar
urge
to
add
their
own
perspective
to
that
portrait
appendix
a
terminology
for
the
most
part
i
have
chosen
to
use
the
term
in
reference
to
the
free
software
operating
system
and
linux
when
referring
specifically
to
the
kernel
that
drives
the
operating
system
the
most
notable
exception
to
this
rule
comes
in
chapter
in
the
final
part
of
that
chapter
i
describe
the
early
evolution
of
linux
as
an
offshoot
of
minix
it
is
safe
to
say
that
during
the
first
two
years
of
the
development
the
operating
system
torvalds
and
his
colleagues
were
working
on
bore
little
similarity
to
the
gnu
system
envisioned
by
stallman
even
though
it
gradually
began
to
share
key
components
such
as
the
gnu
c
compiler
and
the
gnu
debugger
this
decision
further
benefits
from
the
fact
that
prior
to
stallman
saw
little
need
to
insist
on
credit
some
might
view
the
decision
to
use
for
later
versions
of
the
same
operating
system
as
arbitrary
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
was
in
no
way
a
prerequisite
for
gaining
stallman
cooperation
in
the
making
of
this
book
i
came
to
it
of
my
own
accord
partly
because
of
the
operating
system
modular
nature
and
the
community
surrounding
it
and
partly
because
of
the
apolitical
nature
of
the
linux
name
given
that
this
is
a
biography
of
richard
stallman
it
seemed
inappropriate
to
define
the
operating
system
in
apolitical
terms
in
the
final
phases
of
the
book
when
it
became
clear
that
associates
would
be
the
publisher
stallman
did
make
it
a
condition
that
i
use
instead
of
linux
if
expected
him
to
provide
promotional
support
for
the
book
after
publication
when
informed
of
this
i
relayed
my
earlier
decision
and
left
it
up
to
stallman
to
judge
whether
the
resulting
book
met
this
condition
or
not
at
the
time
of
this
writing
i
have
no
idea
what
stallman
judgment
will
be
a
similar
situation
surrounds
the
terms
free
software
and
open
source
again
i
have
opted
for
the
more
politically
laden
free
software
term
when
describing
software
programs
that
come
with
freely
copyable
and
freely
modifiable
source
code
although
more
popular
i
have
chosen
to
use
the
term
open
source
only
when
referring
to
groups
and
businesses
that
have
championed
its
usage
but
for
a
few
instances
the
terms
are
completely
interchangeable
and
in
making
this
decision
i
have
followed
the
advice
of
christine
peterson
the
person
generally
credited
with
coining
the
term
the
software
term
should
still
be
used
in
circumstances
where
it
works
better
peterson
writes
source
caught
on
mainly
because
a
new
term
was
greatly
needed
not
because
it
ideal

understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
word

helps
to
examine
the
word

the
years

new
hacker
dictionary
an
online
compendium
of
jargon
officially
lists
nine
different
connotations
of
the
word
hack
and
a
similar
number
for
hacker
then
again
the
same
publication
also
includes
an
accompanying
essay
that
quotes
phil

warns
readers

the
fifties
used
the
word
hack
the
way
a
modern
student
might
use
the
word
goof
hanging
a
jalopy
out
a
dormitory
window
was
a
hack
but
anything
harsh
or
egging
a
rival
dorm
windows
or
defacing
a
campus
outside
the
bounds
implicit
within
the
definition
of
hack
was
a
spirit
of
harmless
creative
fun
this
spirit
would
inspire
the
word
gerund
form
hacking
a
student
who
spent
the
better
part
of
the
afternoon
talking
on
the
phone
or
dismantling
a
radio
might
describe
the
activity
as
hacking
again
a
modern
speaker
would
substitute
the
verb
form
of
goof
goofing
or
goofing
off
describe
the
same
activity
as
the
progressed
the
word
hack
acquired
a
sharper
more
rebellious
edge
the
mit
of
the
was
overly
competitive
and
hacking
emerged
as
both
a
reaction
to
and
extension
of
that
competitive
culture
goofs
and
pranks
suddenly
became
a
way
to
blow
off
steam
thumb
one
nose
at
campus
administration
and
indulge
creative
thinking
and
behavior
stifled
by
the
institute
rigorous
undergraduate
curriculum
with
its
myriad
hallways
and
underground
steam
tunnels
the
institute
offered
plenty
of
exploration
opportunities
for
the
student
undaunted
by
locked
doors
and
no
trespassing
signs
students
began
to
refer
to
their
explorations
as
tunnel
hacking
above
ground
the
campus
phone
system
offered
similar
opportunities
through
casual
experimentation
and
due
diligence
students
learned
how
to
perform
humorous
tricks
drawing
inspiration
from
the
more
traditional
pursuit
of
tunnel
hacking
students
quickly
dubbed
this
new
activity
phone
hacking
the
combined
emphasis
on
creative
play
and
exploration
would
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
future
mutations
of
the
hacking
term
the
first
computer
hackers
of
the
mit
campus
originated
from
a
late
student
group
called
the
tech
model
railroad
club
a
tight
clique
within
the
club
was
the
signals
and
power
s
p
group
behind
the
railroad
club
electrical
circuitry
system
the
system
was
a
sophisticated
assortment
of
relays
and
switches
similar
to
the
kind
that
controlled
the
local
campus
phone
system
to
control
it
a
member
of
the
group
simply
dialed
in
commands
via
a
connected
phone
and
watched
the
trains
do
his
bidding
the
nascent
electrical
engineers
responsible
for
building
and
maintaining
this
system
saw
their
activity
as
similar
in
spirit
to
phone
hacking
adopting
the
hacking
term
they
began
refining
it
even
further
from
the
s
p
hacker
point
of
view
using
one
less
relay
to
operate
a
particular
stretch
of
track
meant
having
one
more
relay
for
future
play
hacking
subtly
shifted
from
a
synonym
for
idle
play
to
a
synonym
for
idle
play
that
improved
the
overall
performance
or
efficiency
of
the
club
railroad
system
at
the
same
time
soon
s
p
committee
members
proudly
referred
to
the
entire
activity
of
improving
and
reshaping
the
underlying
circuitry
as
hacking
and
to
the
people
who
did
it
as
hackers
given
their
affinity
for
sophisticated
to
mention
the
traditional
disregard
for
closed
doors
and
no
trespassing
did
take
long
before
the
hackers
caught
wind
of
a
new
machine
on
campus
dubbed
the
the
machine
was
one
of
the
first
commercially
marketed
computers
by
the
end
of
the
the
entire
s
p
clique
had
migrated
en
masse
over
to
the
control
room
bringing
the
spirit
of
creative
play
with
them
the
realm
of
computer
programming
would
encourage
yet
another
mutation
in
etymology
to
hack
no
longer
meant
soldering
unusual
looking
circuits
but
cobbling
together
software
programs
with
little
regard
to
official
methods
or
procedures
it
also
meant
improving
the
efficiency
and
speed
of
programs
that
tended
to
hog
up
machine
resources
true
to
the
word
roots
it
also
meant
writing
programs
that
served
no
other
purpose
than
to
amuse
or
entertain
a
classic
example
of
this
expanded
hacking
definition
is
the
game
spacewar
the
first
interactive
video
game
developed
by
mit
hackers
in
the
early
spacewar
had
all
the
traditional
hacking
definitions
it
was
goofy
and
random
serving
little
useful
purpose
other
than
providing
a
nightly
distraction
for
the
dozen
or
so
hackers
who
delighted
in
playing
it
from
a
software
perspective
however
it
was
a
monumental
testament
to
innovation
of
programming
skill
it
was
also
completely
free
because
hackers
had
built
it
for
fun
they
saw
no
reason
to
guard
their
creation
sharing
it
extensively
with
other
programmers
by
the
end
of
the
spacewar
had
become
a
favorite
diversion
for
mainframe
programmers
around
the
world
this
notion
of
collective
innovation
and
communal
software
ownership
distanced
the
act
of
computer
hacking
in
the
from
the
tunnel
hacking
and
phone
hacking
of
the
the
latter
pursuits
tended
to
be
solo
or
activities
tunnel
and
phone
hackers
relied
heavily
on
campus
lore
but
the
nature
of
their
activity
discouraged
the
open
circulation
of
new
discoveries
computer
hackers
on
the
other
hand
did
their
work
amid
a
scientific
field
biased
toward
collaboration
and
the
rewarding
of
innovation
hackers
and
official
computer
scientists
were
always
the
best
of
allies
but
in
the
rapid
evolution
of
the
field
the
two
species
of
computer
programmer
evolved
a
might
say
it
is
a
testament
to
the
original
computer
prodigious
skill
that
later
programmers
including
richard
stallman
aspired
to
wear
the
same
hacker
mantle
by
the
mid
to
late
the
term
hacker
had
acquired
elite
connotations
in
a
general
sense
a
computer
hacker
was
any
person
who
wrote
software
code
for
the
sake
of
writing
software
code
in
the
particular
sense
however
it
was
a
testament
to
programming
skill
like
the
term
artist
the
meaning
carried
tribal
overtones
to
describe
a
fellow
programmer
as
hacker
was
a
sign
of
respect
to
describe
oneself
as
a
hacker
was
a
sign
of
immense
personal
confidence
either
way
the
original
looseness
of
the
appellation
diminished
as
computers
became
more
common
as
the
definition
tightened
computer
hacking
acquired
additional
semantic
overtones
to
be
a
hacker
a
person
had
to
do
more
than
write
interesting
software
a
person
had
to
belong
to
the
hacker
culture
and
honor
its
traditions
the
same
way
a
medieval
wine
maker
might
pledge
membership
to
a
vintners
guild
the
social
structure
was
as
rigidly
outlined
as
that
of
a
guild
but
hackers
at
elite
institutions
such
as
mit
stanford
and
carnegie
mellon
began
to
speak
openly
of
a
hacker
ethic
the
rules
that
governed
a
hacker
behavior
in
the
book
hackers
author
steven
levy
after
much
research
and
consultation
codified
the
hacker
ethic
as
five
core
hacker
tenets
in
many
ways
the
core
tenets
listed
by
levy
continue
to
define
the
culture
of
computer
hacking
still
the
image
of
the
hacker
community
was
undermined
by
the
overwhelmingly
populist
bias
of
the
software
industry
by
the
early
computers
were
popping
up
everywhere
and
programmers
who
once
would
have
had
to
travel
to
institutions
or
businesses
just
to
gain
access
to
a
machine
suddenly
had
the
ability
to
rub
elbows
with
hackers
via
the
arpanet
the
more
these
programmers
rubbed
elbows
the
more
they
began
to
appropriate
the
anarchic
philosophies
of
the
hacker
culture
in
places
like
mit
lost
within
the
cultural
transfer
however
was
the
native
mit
cultural
taboo
against
malicious
behavior
as
younger
programmers
began
employing
their
computer
skills
to
harmful
and
disseminating
computer
viruses
breaking
into
military
computer
systems
deliberately
causing
machines
such
as
mit
oz
a
popular
arpanet
gateway
to
term
hacker
acquired
a
punk
nihilistic
edge
when
police
and
businesses
began
tracing
crimes
back
to
a
few
renegade
programmers
who
cited
convenient
portions
of
the
hacking
ethic
in
defense
of
their
activities
the
word
hacker
began
appearing
in
newspapers
and
magazine
stories
in
a
negative
light
although
books
like
hackers
did
much
to
document
the
original
spirit
of
exploration
that
gave
rise
to
the
hacking
culture
for
most
news
reporters
computer
hacker
became
a
synonym
for
electronic
burglar
although
hackers
have
railed
against
this
perceived
misusage
for
nearly
two
decades
the
term
rebellious
connotations
dating
back
to
the
make
it
hard
to
discern
the
writing
software
programs
that
circumvent
modern
encryption
programs
from
the
college
student
picking
locks
and
battering
down
doors
to
gain
access
to
the
lone
office
computer
terminal
one
person
creative
subversion
of
authority
is
another
person
security
headache
after
all
even
so
the
central
taboo
against
malicious
or
deliberately
harmful
behavior
remains
strong
enough
that
most
hackers
prefer
to
use
the
term
cracker
a
person
who
deliberately
cracks
a
computer
security
system
to
steal
or
vandalize
describe
the
subset
of
hackers
who
apply
their
computing
skills
maliciously
this
central
taboo
against
maliciousness
remains
the
primary
cultural
link
between
the
notion
of
hacking
in
the
early
century
and
hacking
in
the
it
is
important
to
note
that
as
the
idea
of
computer
hacking
has
evolved
over
the
last
four
decades
the
original
notion
of
performing
pranks
or
exploring
underground
intact
in
the
fall
of
the
mit
museum
paid
tradition
to
the
hacking
tradition
with
a
dedicated
exhibit
the
hall
of
hacks
the
exhibit
includes
a
number
of
photographs
dating
back
to
the
including
one
involving
a
mock
police
cruiser
in
students
paid
homage
to
the
original
mit
notion
of
hacking
by
placing
the
same
police
cruiser
lights
flashing
atop
the
institute
main
dome
the
cruiser
vanity
license
plate
read

a
popular
mit
acronym
with
many
meanings
the
most
noteworthy
version
itself
dating
back
to
the
world
of
mit
student
life
in
the
is
i
hate
this
fucking
place
in
however
the
museum
used
the
acronym
as
a
basis
for
a
journal
on
the
history
of
hacks
titled
the
institute
for
hacks
tomfoolery
and
pranks
the
journal
offers
an
adept
summary
of
the
hacking
in
the
culture
of
hacking
an
elegant
simple
creation
is
as
highly
valued
as
it
is
in
pure
science
writes
boston
globe
reporter
randolph
ryan
in
a
article
attached
to
the
police
car
exhibit
a
hack
differs
from
the
ordinary
college
prank
in
that
the
event
usually
requires
careful
planning
engineering
and
finesse
and
has
an
underlying
wit
and
inventiveness
ryan
writes
the
unwritten
rule
holds
that
a
hack
should
be
and
safe
in
fact
hackers
sometimes
assist
in
dismantling
their
own
handiwork
the
urge
to
confine
the
culture
of
computer
hacking
within
the
same
ethical
boundaries
is
but
impossible
although
most
software
hacks
aspire
to
the
same
spirit
of
elegance
and
simplicity
the
software
medium
offers
less
chance
for
reversibility
dismantling
a
police
cruiser
is
easy
compared
with
dismantling
an
idea
especially
an
idea
whose
time
has
come
hence
the
growing
distinction
between
black
hat
and
white
hat
hackers
who
turn
new
ideas
toward
destructive
malicious
ends
versus
hackers
who
turn
new
ideas
toward
positive
or
at
the
very
least
informative
ends
once
a
vague
item
of
obscure
student
jargon
the
word
hacker
has
become
a
linguistic
billiard
ball
subject
to
political
spin
and
ethical
nuances
perhaps
this
is
why
so
many
hackers
and
journalists
enjoy
using
it
where
that
ball
bounces
next
however
is
anybody
