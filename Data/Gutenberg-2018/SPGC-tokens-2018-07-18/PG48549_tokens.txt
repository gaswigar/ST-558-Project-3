one
farewell
to
the
the
launch
purred
smoothly
across
the
calm
waters
of
the
harbor
making
for
the
navy
yard
pier
their
feet
braced
against
the
slow
roll
of
the
boat
two
young
men
stood
looking
at
the
huge
gray
ship
they
had
just
left
i
m
beginning
to
have
my
doubts
scoot
bailey
said
almost
to
himself
same
here
the
other
replied
march
anson
was
shorter
than
his
friend
but
more
solidly
and
compactly
built
his
eyes
were
steady
and
cool
matching
the
set
of
his
jaw
but
the
crinkling
lines
at
their
corners
showed
that
this
apparently
serious
young
man
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
smiling
or
laughing
she
was
a
swell
ship
scoot
said
sadly
exclaimed
march
she
still
is
just
because
bailey
and
anson
have
left
her
don
t
you
think
she
can
carry
on
any
longer
a
slow
smile
spread
over
his
face
as
he
turned
to
look
at
his
friend
but
scoot
was
serious
oh
sure
march
he
replied
but
she
s
out
of
our
lives
now
she
s
past
tense
for
us
she
s
been
just
about
everything
to
us
for
a
year
mother
and
sweetheart
i
know
what
you
mean
march
said
and
it
s
natural
for
us
to
wonder
if
we
ve
done
the
right
thing
in
being
transferred
right
now
we
re
looking
at
what
we
re
leaving
in
another
ten
minutes
we
ll
be
concentrating
on
what
we
re
going
to
scoot
bailey
turned
around
and
sat
down
i
m
going
to
start
right
now
he
grinned
no
use
getting
sentimental
about
the
old
at
this
point
i
m
going
to
start
thinking
about
the
or
the
or
whatever
aircraft
carrier
i
ll
be
on
in
a
few
good
idea
march
agreed
sitting
beside
the
tall
and
gangling
young
man
who
now
stared
ahead
at
the
navy
yard
but
that
s
one
trouble
right
now
scoot
neither
one
of
us
knows
exactly
where
he
ll
be
if
you
knew
exactly
what
ship
you
d
be
attached
to
you
could
make
your
thoughts
more
specific
when
you
get
there
you
know
you
ll
love
her
just
as
much
as
you
ve
loved
the
in
fact
because
you
ll
be
flying
at
last
yes
i
know
but
what
about
you
scoot
asked
i
still
can
t
figure
out
why
you
want
to
be
a
pigboat
man
and
what
can
you
dream
about
now
as
you
look
into
the
future
the
name
of
some
fish
that
s
sure
subs
are
named
after
fish
march
replied
and
they
have
some
swell
names
the
the
the
yes
they
sound
all
right
scoot
grinned
but
what
if
you
re
assigned
to
the
or
the
or
the
no
i
can
t
figure
out
what
you
see
in
those
stuffy
cramped
oversized
bathtubs
this
argument
had
been
going
on
ever
since
march
anson
and
scoot
bailey
had
been
in
the
navy
together
neither
one
minded
the
jibes
of
the
other
but
the
dispute
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
air
and
underwater
craft
never
ended
cozy
and
snug
march
said
stoutly
that
s
what
subs
are
not
cramped
and
stuffy
re
all
now
maybe
so
scoot
said
shaking
his
head
but
no
can
match
the
clear
blue
sky
a
couple
of
miles
up
there
where
i
ll
be
flying
a
chance
just
what
i
ve
always
wanted
their
departure
from
the
cruiser
was
forgotten
now
as
they
thought
of
their
futures
only
one
aspect
of
that
future
was
rarely
mentioned
by
either
of
them
and
they
tried
not
to
think
too
much
about
it
in
their
new
activities
they
would
not
be
two
who
had
been
inseparable
friends
for
so
many
long
years
they
had
met
in
the
first
year
of
high
school
back
in
that
small
ohio
city
which
now
during
war
seemed
so
many
miles
and
so
many
years
away
scoot
had
lived
in
hampton
all
his
life
but
march
had
just
moved
there
from
the
farm
which
his
mother
had
sold
when
his
father
died
a
widow
with
a
son
only
thirteen
years
old
could
not
run
a
farm
she
had
decided
not
if
her
son
was
to
get
the
education
she
had
determined
he
would
have
so
the
farm
had
been
sold
and
anson
and
her
young
son
had
moved
to
the
city
of
hampton
march
started
high
school
and
his
mother
went
back
to
teaching
her
profession
before
she
married
clement
anson
and
settled
down
to
farm
life
the
money
from
the
farm
sale
was
tucked
away
in
the
bank
to
be
forgotten
until
the
time
came
for
march
to
enter
college
march
and
scoot
had
sat
next
to
each
other
in
the
big
assembly
hall
of
hampton
high
school
on
the
first
day
they
had
taken
to
each
other
at
once
and
from
that
time
had
been
the
closest
of
friends
some
people
had
wondered
at
the
deep
friendship
of
these
two
who
in
some
ways
seemed
so
different
scoot
had
always
been
a
noisy
and
boisterous
kid
eager
for
any
activity
that
meant
speed
excitement
and
a
little
bit
of
danger
the
more
conservative
parents
shook
their
heads
and
called
him
a
little
wild
although
he
never
got
into
serious
trouble
march
anson
on
the
other
hand
was
quiet
and
serious
on
the
farm
he
had
worked
hard
and
had
learned
the
value
of
hard
work
in
school
he
studied
thoroughly
and
carefully
even
in
sports
he
was
serious
playing
games
as
though
he
looked
on
them
as
work
not
as
pleasure
but
march
and
scoot
recognized
in
each
other
at
once
the
hidden
qualities
that
lay
beneath
the
surface
indications
of
their
character
scoot
saw
that
march
really
enjoyed
life
tremendously
he
just
didn
t
whoop
and
shout
about
it
he
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
in
a
tough
football
game
played
hard
he
loved
the
talk
and
chatter
of
a
gang
of
boys
discussing
the
game
afterward
even
though
he
spent
more
time
listening
than
talking
himself
he
liked
the
school
dances
even
though
he
was
somewhat
timid
with
girls
and
danced
so
quietly
that
he
stood
out
in
contrast
to
the
majority
of
wildly
capering
youngsters
scoot
learned
to
appreciate
the
slow
smile
that
spread
over
march
s
face
when
he
was
enjoying
himself
when
something
amusing
happened
he
could
look
at
march
and
see
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
others
seemed
to
miss
in
the
same
way
march
saw
that
beneath
scoot
s
noisy
impulsiveness
there
was
a
great
deal
of
calm
courage
a
daring
that
had
in
it
nothing
of
foolhardiness
the
good
deal
of
confidence
scoot
had
a
serious
side
that
none
of
his
friends
until
march
came
along
had
penetrated
he
never
seemed
to
study
much
but
his
grades
were
always
good
that
was
because
scoot
never
announced
no
i
can
t
do
have
to
go
home
and
study
scoot
was
ready
to
do
anything
suggested
by
anyone
but
he
still
managed
to
get
his
studying
done
after
the
play
was
over
by
the
time
they
graduated
from
high
school
together
scoot
and
march
had
both
changed
a
good
deal
each
one
influenced
by
the
other
at
a
first
glance
they
seemed
just
the
same
as
always
but
march
was
less
retiring
less
timid
while
scoot
did
not
always
hide
under
his
playful
spirit
his
more
serious
interests
in
life
when
they
went
off
to
the
state
university
together
they
wondered
how
long
it
would
last
for
war
was
already
in
the
air
it
s
coming
scoot
said
just
as
sure
as
shootin
war
s
coming
and
i
m
going
to
be
in
it
just
about
five
minutes
after
it
they
ve
been
staving
it
off
for
a
long
time
march
said
and
maybe
they
can
keep
it
up
a
few
years
longer
but
i
don
t
think
they
can
ever
satisfy
that
hitler
guy
giving
in
to
a
pig
won
t
ll
just
keep
demanding
more
and
more
but
maybe
we
ll
get
our
college
education
before
the
guns
start
popping
but
the
guns
had
started
firing
in
europe
before
their
second
year
when
the
first
peacetime
selective
service
act
was
passed
in
the
united
states
scoot
was
very
excited
at
being
below
the
age
and
wanted
to
enlist
at
once
but
it
was
march
who
persuaded
him
against
it
we
can
do
more
good
going
right
on
getting
our
education
until
they
need
us
he
insisted
then
we
ll
be
that
much
better
equipped
to
do
a
good
his
argument
prevailed
over
scoot
then
but
the
war
became
their
favorite
topic
of
conversation
from
that
time
on
many
others
in
the
college
were
not
interested
they
felt
that
the
war
was
thousands
of
miles
away
that
two
big
oceans
were
enough
insulation
to
keep
it
away
from
america
but
scoot
and
march
felt
sure
it
was
coming
they
followed
the
war
news
carefully
their
hearts
sinking
as
hitler
s
gangs
overran
one
country
after
another
in
europe
they
spent
their
spare
time
reading
books
and
articles
about
the
war
the
new
weapons
and
tactics
that
were
being
used
it
was
then
that
scoot
knew
that
he
wanted
to
be
a
flier
and
then
that
march
first
developed
his
interest
in
submarines
this
is
an
air
war
scoot
insisted
it
s
going
to
be
fought
and
won
in
the
air
the
whole
thing
march
demanded
i
wouldn
t
deny
the
importance
of
planes
but
i
d
never
agree
that
they
ll
do
the
whole
job
alone
the
country
planes
can
t
win
i
ll
say
that
much
but
look
at
germany
s
look
at
the
damage
they
re
doing
if
england
can
t
get
her
supplies
by
she
s
sunk
the
argument
that
never
ended
was
begun
right
then
march
and
scoot
read
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
about
submarines
and
airplanes
and
when
the
japs
attacked
pearl
harbor
scoot
wanted
to
get
in
a
plane
and
fly
by
instinct
out
over
the
pacific
to
give
them
a
taste
of
their
own
medicine
he
had
just
decided
to
enlist
when
the
navy
s
program
for
college
students
was
plan
which
carried
students
through
an
intensive
training
course
which
resulted
in
commissions
as
ensigns
for
march
there
was
no
doubt
about
what
course
to
follow
he
signed
up
for
at
once
already
sure
that
he
would
be
sailing
in
a
submarine
before
the
year
was
out
scoot
could
not
make
up
his
mind
for
a
few
days
when
he
had
thought
of
flying
he
had
always
thought
of
the
army
air
forces
but
the
navy
had
fliers
too
eventually
it
was
his
burning
hatred
of
the
japs
that
decided
him
there
s
a
lot
of
water
between
us
and
them
he
said
the
navy
will
have
the
biggest
job
in
knocking
them
aircraft
carriers
will
be
the
answer
navy
it
is
for
me
too
so
march
anson
and
scoot
bailey
had
joined
the
navy
gone
were
all
thoughts
of
football
baseball
dances
and
parties
and
suddenly
there
seemed
to
be
little
difference
between
the
two
both
were
now
serious
for
in
the
navy
s
program
there
was
room
for
little
but
serious
hard
work
together
they
crammed
into
their
heads
more
mathematics
than
they
had
thought
of
studying
in
a
whole
college
course
navigation
engineering
english
navy
custom
and
were
crammed
into
them
with
an
intensity
of
which
they
had
never
thought
themselves
capable
both
had
put
in
early
their
requests
for
assignment
to
submarines
and
to
air
service
and
though
they
knew
that
the
navy
tried
to
place
men
where
they
wanted
to
go
they
realized
that
the
navy
s
needs
would
come
first
rather
than
their
wishes
so
they
were
disappointed
though
not
surprised
when
both
requests
were
turned
down
the
submarine
school
at
new
london
even
though
greatly
expanded
was
full
to
overflowing
and
the
applicants
for
naval
aviation
exceeded
by
ten
times
the
number
that
could
be
accepted
new
warships
were
coming
off
the
ways
in
shipyards
all
over
the
country
and
men
were
needed
to
man
them
so
after
some
further
specialized
in
engineering
and
march
in
found
themselves
assigned
to
the
new
cruiser
which
had
been
rushed
to
completion
four
months
ahead
of
schedule
on
their
shakedown
cruise
they
had
been
too
interested
in
their
new
huge
ship
and
the
men
they
worked
feel
disappointment
over
missing
out
on
their
chosen
fields
they
knew
they
were
already
a
part
of
the
war
and
the
job
they
were
doing
was
important
as
ensigns
they
were
two
very
junior
officers
on
the
ship
almost
as
large
as
their
home
town
but
they
had
their
jobs
and
they
learned
more
about
them
and
about
all
ships
every
day
the
navy
lost
no
time
after
ship
and
crew
were
deemed
fit
and
ready
for
action
in
getting
them
to
the
pacific
where
the
losses
suffered
at
pearl
harbor
had
put
the
united
states
at
a
great
though
temporary
disadvantage
by
the
time
they
had
made
the
long
trip
down
the
eastern
coast
through
the
panama
canal
and
across
almost
half
the
pacific
to
pearl
harbor
scoot
and
march
felt
like
veterans
the
executive
officer
of
the
commander
seaton
had
taken
a
liking
to
them
because
of
their
application
to
their
jobs
and
their
desire
to
learn
all
they
could
he
saw
to
it
that
they
got
varied
experiences
shifting
to
different
jobs
carried
out
by
junior
officers
from
time
to
time
in
company
with
a
battleship
two
light
cruisers
and
twelve
destroyers
they
left
pearl
harbor
as
a
task
force
heading
for
action
in
the
southwest
pacific
and
action
was
not
long
in
coming
in
the
coral
sea
the
small
task
force
ran
into
a
jap
convoy
heavily
screened
by
warships
trying
to
sneak
an
end
run
around
the
corner
of
australia
two
aircraft
carriers
had
gone
out
to
break
up
the
convoy
but
they
were
so
outnumbered
by
the
enemy
that
they
were
in
a
bad
way
when
the
force
arrived
on
the
scene
under
full
steam
the
japs
were
taken
by
surprise
lost
their
tight
organization
and
fled
north
leaving
behind
three
troopships
and
four
destroyers
heading
for
the
bottom
scoot
had
been
joyful
at
his
first
battle
experience
but
was
angry
that
he
had
not
been
on
the
guns
just
when
the
fighting
starts
i
have
to
be
down
in
the
engine
room
he
moaned
didn
t
even
anything
let
alone
take
a
shot
at
those
dirty
nips
well
i
plenty
march
replied
but
navigation
officers
don
t
get
a
chance
at
much
shooting
either
scoot
by
dint
of
much
pleading
and
arguing
got
commander
seaton
to
transfer
him
to
gunnery
but
then
eight
weeks
went
by
without
a
sight
of
a
jap
the
first
shots
scoot
fired
were
into
shore
installations
of
the
japs
at
munda
airfield
in
the
solomons
after
the
marines
had
consolidated
their
hold
on
guadalcanal
and
had
decided
to
move
forward
to
another
island
the
big
battle
had
come
almost
ten
months
after
they
had
shipped
aboard
the
up
in
the
bismarck
sea
northeast
of
new
guinea
finally
finding
the
sizable
jap
force
for
which
he
had
been
looking
admiral
caldwell
in
charge
of
the
force
had
steamed
right
into
the
middle
of
the
bevy
of
jap
ships
and
opened
fire
with
everything
he
had
for
seven
hours
mostly
at
night
the
battle
had
raged
jap
planes
were
attacking
overhead
at
least
until
planes
drove
them
off
at
dawn
the
firing
on
all
sides
was
so
deafening
that
no
one
could
hear
even
scoot
s
whoops
of
glee
and
happiness
when
three
of
his
gun
crew
went
down
under
a
hail
of
flying
fragments
from
a
shell
that
landed
on
the
deck
not
fifty
feet
away
scoot
carried
on
with
the
few
that
were
left
but
the
rate
of
fire
was
cut
so
he
rounded
up
a
cook
and
a
messboy
and
turned
them
into
expert
gunners
in
five
minutes
and
knocked
three
jap
planes
out
of
the
sky
with
his
improvised
gun
crew
in
ten
minutes
meanwhile
march
had
not
been
idle
the
shell
whose
fragments
had
laid
low
part
of
scoot
s
crew
had
landed
squarely
on
one
of
the
gun
turrets
forward
march
was
the
first
man
into
the
smoking
and
wrecked
turret
pulling
out
the
wounded
and
dead
who
were
there
at
any
moment
the
ammunition
below
might
have
no
one
knew
if
the
shell
had
penetrated
that
march
had
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
three
of
the
men
he
lugged
from
the
turret
were
still
alive
though
closer
to
death
than
march
had
ever
seen
anyone
later
the
medical
officer
told
march
those
three
had
lived
only
because
they
got
medical
attention
so
fast
when
it
was
all
over
and
half
the
jap
force
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
while
the
rest
ran
for
cover
pursued
by
american
planes
the
men
on
the
wearily
surveyed
the
damage
done
to
their
ship
it
was
plenty
but
a
month
in
port
would
fix
her
up
again
as
they
headed
slowly
for
pearl
harbor
for
repairs
scoot
and
march
got
the
big
surprise
of
their
lives
they
had
no
thought
of
making
heroes
of
themselves
and
they
never
could
figure
out
how
in
the
heat
of
battle
any
officer
could
have
seen
just
what
they
did
yet
when
the
citations
came
along
scoot
and
march
both
found
themselves
on
the
list
commended
for
conspicuous
gallantry
in
action
my
golly
we
didn
t
do
anything
scoot
had
objected
even
though
he
was
beaming
all
over
with
pleasure
everybody
else
did
the
same
kind
of
thing
all
the
crew
were
fighting
just
as
hard
as
we
were
yes
but
they
didn
t
all
keep
their
heads
under
fire
and
show
the
spontaneously
clear
thinking
that
you
two
did
commander
seaton
said
to
them
in
a
friendly
talk
later
that
s
what
s
what
makes
leaders
of
men
and
the
navy
needs
leaders
these
days
by
the
way
the
skipper
asked
me
if
there
was
anything
special
we
could
do
for
you
you
wanted
especially
i
told
him
that
you
scoot
had
wanted
to
be
a
navy
flier
and
that
march
had
wanted
to
be
a
submariner
if
you
still
feel
that
way
the
skipper
ll
recommend
your
transfer
to
those
march
and
scoot
were
dumbfounded
and
it
had
not
been
an
easy
thing
to
decide
though
a
few
months
before
they
would
not
have
hesitated
for
an
instant
scoot
still
wanted
to
fly
march
still
wanted
to
go
into
the
pigboats
but
they
had
lived
on
the
gone
through
battle
with
her
and
they
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
leaving
her
now
it
was
march
who
made
up
his
mind
first
i
m
going
to
ask
for
the
transfer
he
said
i
hate
to
leave
this
ship
and
the
men
on
it
and
the
action
i
know
she
ll
be
seeing
after
a
battle
or
two
you
don
t
feel
like
going
back
to
school
again
you
want
to
go
on
to
more
battles
but
i
love
the
idea
of
submarines
so
much
that
i
know
i
d
be
a
better
man
in
a
pigboat
than
i
can
ever
be
on
a
surface
ship
so
i
ll
take
a
few
months
out
learn
what
i
have
to
learn
and
come
back
to
this
part
of
the
world
and
really
send
some
of
those
jap
ships
to
the
guess
you
re
right
scoot
agreed
it
won
t
be
long
so
they
had
said
farewell
to
the
sadly
as
they
stepped
into
the
launch
taking
them
ashore
and
they
had
stood
looking
at
the
great
gray
ship
as
the
little
boat
moved
toward
the
navy
yard
pier
but
now
their
eyes
were
set
forward
they
had
a
long
way
to
travel
to
get
home
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
studying
to
do
before
they
could
accomplish
what
they
wanted
they
stepped
from
the
launch
and
stood
on
the
pier
for
a
last
moment
they
looked
out
at
the
once
more
so
long
old
gal
scoot
said
you
ll
be
getting
your
face
lifted
here
at
pearl
harbor
and
you
ll
be
back
in
the
thick
of
it
soon
maybe
i
ll
see
you
out
i
m
up
in
the
blue
sky
flying
my
grumman
yes
and
some
time
when
i
m
submerged
and
hear
the
throb
of
a
cruiser
s
engines
march
added
i
ll
stick
up
the
periscope
for
a
peek
wondering
whether
that
ship
is
friend
or
foe
and
it
ll
turn
out
to
be
my
old
friend
my
old
sweetheart
the
together
the
two
young
men
turned
and
walked
toward
their
new
lives
chapter
two
back
to
school
march
felt
lonely
as
he
stood
on
the
corner
opposite
the
railroad
station
in
new
london
waiting
for
the
bus
it
was
cold
and
there
was
rain
in
the
air
the
wind
whipped
about
him
as
he
stood
close
to
the
building
the
was
a
world
miles
away
by
this
time
although
it
had
been
less
than
a
month
since
he
left
it
first
there
had
been
the
wait
of
a
few
days
in
hawaii
before
they
found
space
in
a
plane
heading
back
for
the
united
states
but
those
had
been
good
in
that
they
saw
how
completely
erased
were
the
effects
of
the
first
terrible
jap
attack
then
too
there
had
been
time
to
rest
to
swim
and
to
lie
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
finally
the
long
hop
had
brought
them
back
to
america
which
they
had
left
so
long
before
it
was
the
first
time
either
march
or
scoot
had
been
in
san
francisco
and
they
enjoyed
the
two
days
spent
there
before
taking
the
train
east
finally
there
had
been
two
weeks
leave
back
in
hampton
they
had
seen
their
parents
visited
their
old
friends
slept
late
and
eaten
huge
meals
they
had
even
been
persuaded
to
make
an
embarrassed
to
be
accompanied
by
the
assembly
hall
of
the
old
high
school
their
leave
had
come
to
an
end
all
too
soon
then
both
young
men
had
been
faced
with
the
prospect
of
saying
goodbye
not
only
to
their
folks
and
their
friends
but
to
each
other
it
was
one
fact
that
both
of
them
had
tried
to
avoid
thinking
about
but
as
the
time
approached
they
were
very
aware
of
it
for
so
many
years
they
had
been
together
almost
every
they
had
taken
each
other
for
granted
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
they
were
closer
than
many
brothers
that
each
one
supplied
something
necessary
and
important
to
the
other
they
couldn
t
say
much
of
course
when
they
finally
did
say
goodbye
it
was
march
s
train
which
left
first
although
scoot
would
be
heading
south
only
two
hours
later
they
were
all
at
the
station
in
s
mother
scoot
s
father
and
mother
and
kid
sister
march
had
to
say
goodbye
to
all
of
them
and
step
on
to
the
train
alone
he
shook
hands
with
scoot
my
golly
he
stammered
i
m
going
to
be
worried
about
you
scoot
you
ve
had
me
around
to
look
after
you
and
keep
you
out
of
trouble
so
long
that
i
don
t
know
how
you
ll
make
out
they
all
laughed
a
little
and
scoot
tried
to
kid
back
at
march
but
his
heart
wasn
t
in
it
don
t
worry
about
me
he
replied
i
think
the
baby
is
busy
worrying
about
the
nurse
this
time
anyway
if
it
makes
you
feel
good
march
maybe
you
ll
have
a
chance
to
get
me
out
of
trouble
in
the
pacific
i
will
at
that
march
tried
to
act
serious
i
can
just
see
myself
dashing
up
in
my
trusty
submarine
and
rescuing
you
from
a
bunch
of
later
when
they
meet
under
circumstances
not
very
different
from
march
s
joking
suggestion
it
was
scoot
who
remembered
what
his
friend
had
said
back
in
the
station
in
hampton
ohio
but
at
the
time
it
was
nothing
but
banter
the
kind
of
talk
made
to
cover
up
real
thoughts
that
are
too
deep
to
be
expressed
easily
and
in
another
moment
the
train
came
thundering
down
the
track
there
was
a
last
hurried
round
of
goodbyes
and
march
was
on
the
train
waving
and
smiling
from
the
car
platform
as
it
pulled
away
from
his
home
because
the
train
was
crowded
march
had
been
busy
trying
to
find
a
place
to
sit
his
suitcase
on
the
same
platform
was
the
seat
he
finally
chose
until
they
pulled
into
pittsburgh
and
he
found
a
more
comfortable
seat
the
ride
had
been
dirty
and
uninteresting
and
march
felt
himself
getting
depressed
long
before
they
reached
new
york
there
he
had
to
rush
to
get
the
train
for
new
london
and
now
he
stood
on
that
windy
rainy
corner
waiting
for
a
bus
feeling
sorry
that
he
had
ever
won
the
chance
to
get
into
submarine
work
then
he
remembered
the
one
thing
that
had
made
him
feel
good
since
he
had
left
hampton
and
he
glanced
down
at
the
cuff
of
his
sleeve
it
extra
stripe
that
had
been
added
when
he
became
a
lieutenant
instead
of
the
lowest
of
commissioned
officers
an
ensign
the
promotion
had
come
to
them
when
they
were
in
hampton
on
both
scoot
and
march
they
had
quickly
added
the
new
stripes
to
cuffs
to
shoulder
boards
and
had
got
the
gold
bars
to
wear
on
their
work
uniform
shirts
march
felt
very
proud
and
pleased
for
the
promotion
had
come
quickly
for
such
young
men
in
the
navy
going
to
the
submarine
school
as
a
lieutenant
even
if
only
or
junior
grade
was
much
better
than
walking
in
as
an
ensign
he
was
staring
at
the
stripes
on
his
cuff
and
smiling
so
that
he
didn
t
notice
the
salute
of
the
three
men
who
approached
him
only
when
the
first
man
spoke
did
he
look
up
going
to
the
sub
base
sir
march
saw
a
sailor
with
the
insigne
of
a
petty
officer
third
class
on
his
sleeve
a
sturdy
smiling
young
man
with
his
seabag
over
his
shoulder
behind
him
appeared
three
more
men
of
the
same
rank
the
first
march
noticed
was
a
radioman
two
of
the
others
fire
controlmen
and
the
last
a
pharmacist
yes
waiting
for
the
bus
march
answered
with
a
smile
is
this
the
place
to
wait
for
it
that
s
what
we
were
told
sir
the
radioman
said
you
see
we
re
just
reporting
there
for
the
oh
so
am
i
march
said
i
thought
maybe
you
men
were
there
already
and
just
in
town
on
liberty
but
you
wouldn
t
have
brought
your
seabags
along
in
such
a
case
would
you
in
a
moment
the
bus
appeared
and
they
all
climbed
aboard
on
the
long
ride
out
of
town
and
along
the
river
they
talked
together
about
the
school
they
were
going
to
and
march
caught
again
in
these
men
s
enthusiasm
his
old
feeling
of
excitement
about
going
into
submarines
the
men
who
had
obviously
just
met
as
they
went
to
the
bus
together
were
discussing
their
reasons
for
volunteering
for
submarine
duty
i
had
two
uncles
in
the
navy
the
pharmacist
said
i
ll
never
forget
the
way
they
talked
about
submariners
they
had
both
tried
but
couldn
t
pass
the
tests
they
thought
the
pigboat
men
were
the
cream
of
the
speaking
of
the
hard
tests
one
of
the
fire
controlmen
said
that
s
really
why
i
first
got
the
notion
of
applying
for
sub
duty
i
heard
it
was
the
toughest
branch
of
the
service
to
get
into
and
stay
i
just
kind
of
like
to
try
any
challenge
like
that
when
i
hear
about
something
really
tough
i
like
to
take
a
crack
at
it
this
is
harder
to
get
into
than
aviation
illustration
to
the
sub
base
sir
march
smiled
and
thought
of
scoot
who
had
been
worrying
about
his
ability
to
meet
the
strict
qualifications
for
naval
fliers
i
like
the
life
on
a
sub
the
radioman
said
you
good
bunch
of
guys
doin
something
big
together
all
workin
together
like
a
team
and
friendliness
between
officers
and
men
is
swell
not
that
i
don
t
believe
in
strict
he
glanced
at
the
officer
s
stripes
on
march
s
but
i
still
think
it
s
a
good
idea
for
officers
and
men
to
get
friendly
get
to
know
each
other
well
the
way
they
do
on
march
agreed
and
noticed
that
not
one
of
the
men
had
mentioned
the
extra
pay
for
submarine
duty
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
entering
that
branch
and
a
dangerous
branch
of
the
naval
service
that
s
a
good
sign
he
told
himself
of
course
they
ll
like
the
extra
doubt
of
it
s
not
the
reason
they
volunteered
for
sub
duty
they
really
go
into
it
for
its
own
the
bus
turned
and
entered
the
driveway
of
the
sub
base
grounds
and
all
the
men
looked
eagerly
out
the
windows
their
first
look
was
for
the
river
where
they
hoped
to
see
submarines
look
cried
scott
the
radioman
there
s
one
in
dry
dock
and
over
there
by
the
pier
called
another
there
s
a
bunch
of
em
lined
march
looked
at
the
long
slim
lines
of
the
pigboats
and
felt
warm
inside
he
wondered
just
how
soon
he
would
take
his
first
ride
beneath
the
waters
of
long
island
sound
in
one
of
them
the
bus
passed
a
few
buildings
but
the
sailors
had
no
eyes
for
such
ordinary
things
another
structure
had
caught
tall
round
tower
looming
up
above
the
trees
on
the
gently
sloping
hillside
what
s
that
one
of
the
men
asked
a
water
tower
water
tower
s
right
exclaimed
scott
but
a
special
kind
that
s
the
escape
tower
that
s
the
baby
i
m
wondering
about
said
the
pharmacist
i
don
t
know
how
i
ll
like
going
up
through
a
hundred
feet
of
water
with
just
a
funny
gadget
clamped
over
my
nose
and
better
not
let
it
get
you
one
of
the
others
put
in
it
s
one
of
the
first
tests
i
hear
if
you
can
t
handle
the
tests
you
re
tossed
out
of
submarines
pronto
the
bus
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
brick
building
and
stopped
everyone
got
out
and
walked
up
to
the
front
door
inside
march
left
the
men
with
a
smile
and
reported
to
the
personnel
man
in
charge
of
receiving
new
officers
assigned
to
the
school
in
another
half
hour
he
found
himself
in
his
quarters
in
a
building
some
way
up
the
hill
above
the
main
buildings
of
the
base
here
the
school
itself
was
situated
with
its
buildings
for
classrooms
barracks
for
enlisted
men
and
quarters
for
officers
without
wives
married
officers
were
allowed
to
live
in
new
london
with
their
families
and
commute
daily
to
the
school
march
s
room
was
small
but
comfortable
and
he
was
neatly
settled
in
it
in
a
short
while
his
time
in
the
navy
had
taught
him
already
to
travel
light
with
only
the
necessary
belongings
and
to
settle
himself
quickly
he
was
at
home
and
comfortable
by
the
time
he
reported
to
the
officers
mess
for
dinner
there
he
met
other
young
officers
who
also
lived
at
the
school
and
a
few
of
the
instructors
the
latter
were
older
men
full
of
years
and
wisdom
in
the
submarine
service
every
one
of
whom
would
much
rather
have
been
on
active
duty
hunting
down
jap
or
nazi
ships
on
the
oceans
of
the
world
but
they
were
too
valuable
in
the
great
task
of
training
the
hundreds
of
new
officers
needed
for
the
subs
coming
off
the
ways
of
the
shipyards
here
in
new
london
they
could
pass
on
to
the
younger
men
like
march
anson
a
portion
of
their
knowledge
of
pigboats
march
felt
during
dinner
the
quiet
of
these
men
on
the
the
officers
with
whom
he
ate
and
talked
and
played
were
pleasant
and
agreeable
fellows
but
there
had
been
all
types
quiet
ones
the
the
men
with
practical
jokes
and
loud
guffaws
the
grimly
serious
officers
and
everything
in
between
but
here
the
men
were
more
alike
not
that
they
re
all
the
same
he
told
himself
as
he
looked
around
the
table
mcintosh
here
next
to
me
is
quite
different
in
most
ways
from
that
lieutenant
curtin
across
the
table
for
instance
but
they
have
something
in
common
something
similar
in
their
personalities
i
suppose
they
re
sociable
but
in
a
quiet
way
they
re
serious
but
not
without
a
sense
of
march
did
not
realize
that
he
was
describing
himself
when
he
thought
of
the
other
officers
in
this
way
but
he
might
have
known
that
this
question
of
personality
was
one
of
the
most
important
in
considering
men
who
volunteered
for
submarine
service
no
man
in
the
navy
was
ever
assigned
to
sub
work
without
his
request
it
was
an
entirely
volunteer
service
but
there
were
always
far
more
applications
among
both
officers
and
enlisted
men
than
could
be
accepted
so
it
was
possible
for
the
bureau
of
navy
personnel
to
keep
its
standards
very
high
in
selecting
men
for
the
pigboat
branch
when
a
man
already
in
the
navy
was
recommended
by
his
commanding
officer
for
assignment
to
the
sub
school
at
new
london
as
march
had
been
this
did
not
mean
that
the
recommendation
was
accepted
just
like
that
the
bureau
looked
over
the
man
s
record
with
the
greatest
care
and
just
bravery
such
as
march
had
displayed
was
not
enough
even
though
it
counted
strongly
in
his
favor
what
they
looked
for
in
the
diving
navy
was
the
kind
of
man
who
was
brave
cool
under
fire
far
above
the
average
intelligence
with
the
ability
to
get
along
well
with
other
people
under
all
circumstances
and
the
kind
of
nerves
that
didn
t
crack
or
even
show
strain
under
the
greatest
danger
the
worst
crowding
or
seemingly
fatal
situations
as
march
thought
of
this
he
swelled
with
pride
to
think
he
had
been
chosen
for
the
submarine
school
but
that
s
just
the
beginning
he
told
himself
i
feel
pretty
darned
good
to
know
that
i
ve
got
this
far
but
they
re
going
to
watch
me
like
a
hawk
every
moment
i
m
here
i
think
i
can
pass
all
the
tough
physical
tests
okay
because
i
m
in
good
shape
the
studies
are
hard
but
if
i
work
enough
maybe
i
can
handle
them
but
how
will
i
act
the
first
time
i
m
in
a
submerging
sub
how
will
i
react
to
a
crash
dive
they
ll
be
watching
me
and
even
if
i
get
through
the
school
i
m
still
not
a
submariner
why
on
my
first
real
trip
or
two
my
commanding
officer
can
transfer
me
back
to
surface
ships
just
by
saying
the
word
after
dinner
in
the
officers
lounge
march
spoke
with
the
executive
officer
of
the
sub
base
a
kindly
man
with
skin
that
still
looked
as
if
he
spent
a
few
hours
every
day
facing
the
salt
breeze
on
a
ship
s
bridge
captain
sampson
chatted
easily
with
march
as
they
looked
out
the
windows
at
the
gathering
twilight
glad
to
have
you
with
us
anson
he
said
hope
you
like
it
i
m
sure
i
will
sir
march
replied
i
ve
been
looking
forward
to
it
long
i
had
an
idea
this
was
no
sudden
impulse
of
yours
sampson
replied
first
off
you
re
not
the
kind
i
take
it
that
acts
on
sudden
impulses
and
i
imagine
that
subs
always
appealed
to
yes
before
i
was
in
the
navy
that
s
what
i
then
you
ought
to
do
very
well
the
captain
said
you
ll
want
to
make
your
call
on
the
commandant
tomorrow
i
suppose
if
it
can
be
arranged
march
said
will
be
all
right
i
m
sure
sampson
said
for
you
to
present
your
compliments
to
him
there
ll
be
a
few
more
officers
arriving
for
the
new
class
tomorrow
morning
early
i
ve
set
aside
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
afternoon
for
the
calls
report
at
fifteen
o
yes
sir
march
said
when
the
captain
had
gone
march
went
back
to
his
quarters
and
sat
down
to
write
a
few
letters
the
first
was
to
scoot
bailey
dear
scoot
it
began
i
m
here
at
the
submarine
school
in
new
london
tomorrow
things
will
really
start
chapter
three
fifty
pounds
of
pressure
things
really
did
start
the
next
day
for
march
in
the
morning
he
had
a
physical
examination
that
made
all
his
previous
examinations
look
like
quick
eyes
ears
lungs
heart
went
over
march
s
body
so
thoroughly
that
he
felt
not
a
microbe
not
a
blood
cell
had
escaped
their
detection
but
he
knew
without
waiting
for
the
report
that
he
had
no
difficulty
in
meeting
all
the
requirements
in
the
afternoon
there
was
the
official
call
on
the
commandant
which
was
not
the
stiff
and
formal
ceremony
such
naval
customs
often
are
but
an
interesting
and
experience
the
old
man
really
took
the
time
to
talk
informally
and
in
very
friendly
fashion
with
the
new
officers
who
came
to
the
school
march
met
the
new
officers
who
were
just
beginning
their
work
at
the
school
with
him
got
his
schedule
of
duties
for
the
next
few
days
and
managed
to
work
in
a
letter
to
his
mother
in
the
evening
the
next
day
when
march
learned
that
he
had
passed
his
physical
examination
with
flying
colors
he
also
learned
that
one
of
the
doctors
examining
him
had
been
a
psychiatrist
that
s
the
smartest
thing
yet
he
muttered
to
ensign
bigelow
another
new
who
had
just
come
from
a
teaching
assignment
at
one
of
the
navy
s
technical
schools
usually
the
psychological
examination
is
separate
you
know
you
re
going
to
be
questioned
by
a
psychiatrist
who
will
ask
you
all
sorts
of
strange
questions
about
how
you
get
along
with
girls
and
what
you
thought
of
your
teacher
and
what
your
dreams
are
like
added
bigelow
sure
and
you
re
self
conscious
march
went
on
a
smart
doctor
probably
sees
through
that
and
gets
the
real
dope
as
to
what
makes
your
personality
tick
but
it
has
always
struck
me
as
a
sort
of
silly
same
here
bigelow
agreed
even
though
i
know
those
navy
psychiatrists
have
been
right
about
percent
of
the
but
this
was
wonderful
march
exclaimed
i
just
thought
those
three
docs
were
all
looking
at
blood
pressure
and
listening
to
my
heart
and
such
things
sure
one
of
them
was
especially
friendly
and
talked
to
me
a
lot
but
that
was
just
natural
and
come
to
think
of
it
he
talked
a
lot
about
what
i
did
when
i
was
on
the
and
how
i
liked
its
skipper
and
where
i
d
gone
to
i
remember
now
bigelow
said
that
he
asked
me
about
my
leave
before
i
came
here
mentioned
big
drinking
parties
i
didn
t
go
in
for
any
and
said
so
i
thought
he
must
be
a
heavy
drinker
from
the
way
he
talked
but
he
was
just
finding
out
whether
was
or
he
pulled
the
same
line
on
me
march
said
and
i
just
thought
it
was
making
know
the
way
a
dentist
does
before
he
does
something
that
hurts
to
take
your
mind
off
what
s
well
that
won
t
be
the
end
of
the
psychological
tests
bigelow
said
i
understand
that
a
psychiatrist
is
always
there
when
we
make
our
first
dives
and
he
s
just
happening
to
be
around
in
the
tests
he
s
keeping
an
eye
on
us
all
the
some
people
might
not
like
that
idea
march
said
i
suppose
they
wouldn
t
like
the
idea
of
having
somebody
looking
them
over
to
spot
their
bad
reactions
to
everything
that
goes
like
a
guilty
conscience
bigelow
added
always
on
hand
march
grinned
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
a
bad
idea
after
all
it
s
for
our
own
protection
they
ve
got
to
try
to
weed
out
the
guys
who
will
crack
at
the
wrong
time
and
nobody
thinks
he
will
so
you
can
t
find
it
out
just
by
asking
if
i
m
that
kind
then
you
don
t
want
to
find
yourself
out
in
the
pacific
undergoing
a
attack
with
me
alongside
you
suddenly
going
nuts
inside
a
very
small
i
should
say
not
bigelow
said
and
it
s
nothing
especially
against
a
fellow
if
he
can
t
stand
this
particular
kind
of
strain
that
he
gets
in
a
sub
maybe
he
s
got
a
kind
of
of
being
shut
up
in
small
knowing
it
maybe
he
d
make
a
swell
aviator
or
bombardier
or
the
bravest
skipper
in
the
world
it
s
just
that
submarining
takes
certain
qualities
that
s
all
you
ve
either
got
em
or
you
haven
and
those
docs
find
it
out
before
you
go
out
march
agreed
march
spent
the
evening
with
bigelow
and
began
to
like
the
young
man
more
as
he
got
to
know
him
better
stan
bigelow
was
a
chunky
fellow
who
looked
so
hard
that
a
tank
could
not
bowl
him
over
a
broken
nose
covered
with
freckles
added
greatly
to
his
appearance
of
toughness
even
though
it
had
come
as
he
told
march
from
nothing
more
pugilistic
than
a
fall
out
of
a
tree
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
landed
just
wrong
on
a
pile
of
rocks
he
said
didn
t
hurt
a
thing
but
my
nose
i
was
at
a
summer
camp
and
the
doc
there
didn
t
fix
it
up
right
by
the
time
somebody
tried
to
put
it
back
into
a
decent
shape
the
bones
had
set
too
despite
stan
s
look
of
a
waterfront
bruiser
he
was
really
a
student
he
had
graduated
from
one
of
the
country
s
engineering
schools
just
before
going
into
the
navy
and
then
had
attended
one
of
the
navy
s
technical
schools
diesel
engines
were
his
specialty
and
he
felt
sure
that
this
knowledge
would
quickly
get
him
into
submarine
work
where
he
wanted
to
be
but
his
work
at
the
technical
school
had
been
so
brilliant
that
they
kept
him
on
as
an
instructor
despite
his
pleas
for
transfer
to
new
london
finally
after
a
year
of
teaching
he
had
been
recommended
for
submarines
by
an
understanding
commanding
officer
so
here
i
am
he
concluded
and
right
now
i
m
scared
to
death
that
it
won
t
make
any
difference
how
much
i
want
to
be
a
submariner
or
how
much
i
know
about
diesels
if
i
get
jittery
in
the
pressure
tank
i
ll
go
you
don
t
even
need
to
get
jittery
march
laughed
how
do
you
know
whether
you
can
stand
pressure
or
not
even
in
perfect
physical
shape
some
people
just
can
t
that
s
all
i
don
t
mean
because
they
re
nervous
maybe
their
noses
bleed
or
their
ears
won
t
make
the
right
adjustment
or
won
t
know
until
we
try
it
stan
exclaimed
i
m
just
going
to
keep
my
fingers
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
march
and
stan
bigelow
along
with
the
other
new
reported
to
the
little
building
at
the
base
of
the
tall
escape
tower
they
were
joined
by
the
new
class
of
enlisted
men
who
were
to
undergo
the
same
tests
during
preliminary
training
there
was
no
difference
between
officers
and
men
in
the
examinations
and
work
they
had
to
undergo
only
later
when
actual
classes
of
study
began
did
they
the
enlisted
men
to
learn
their
particular
trades
in
reference
to
submarines
and
for
the
officers
to
get
the
highly
technical
studies
and
executive
training
they
must
have
march
saw
scott
the
radio
petty
officer
and
the
others
who
had
ridden
to
the
sub
base
on
the
same
bus
with
him
he
called
a
friendly
hello
to
them
as
they
all
stood
waiting
for
the
chief
petty
officer
in
charge
to
call
the
roll
after
roll
was
called
all
the
students
were
instructed
to
strip
to
the
swimming
trunks
they
had
been
instructed
to
wear
eyeing
the
pressure
chamber
suspiciously
all
the
time
looks
like
something
to
shut
somebody
up
in
if
you
never
wanted
him
to
get
out
stan
bigelow
said
nodding
at
the
huge
cylinder
with
its
tiny
portholes
and
small
door
anyway
we
can
look
out
march
said
even
if
the
portholes
are
i
wonder
if
that
psychiatrist
will
be
peeking
in
one
of
those
deadlights
at
us
stan
mused
making
notes
about
every
flicker
of
an
but
then
the
grizzled
old
chief
petty
officer
opened
the
small
door
to
the
chamber
and
ordered
the
new
men
inside
stooping
as
he
stepped
in
march
saw
that
the
sides
of
the
chamber
had
long
benches
about
twenty
feet
long
on
which
the
men
were
to
sit
the
compartment
was
brightly
lighted
and
march
noticed
a
fan
in
one
corner
i
guess
it
gets
a
little
warm
he
told
himself
with
so
many
people
in
a
small
closed
space
like
stan
bigelow
sat
beside
him
on
the
bench
and
the
other
students
filed
in
after
them
march
saw
that
scott
the
radioman
sitting
opposite
him
looked
a
little
frightened
and
he
wondered
if
he
appeared
the
same
to
the
others
funny
how
this
gets
you
stan
said
in
a
low
voice
there
s
not
a
thing
to
be
afraid
of
of
no
the
most
that
can
happen
is
that
your
nose
will
bleed
or
some
small
thing
like
that
will
show
you
can
t
stand
pressure
march
agreed
but
some
of
the
older
guys
around
here
have
had
a
lot
of
fun
particularly
with
the
enlisted
men
building
up
some
fancy
pictures
of
what
the
pressure
tank
and
escape
tower
are
like
they
say
you
get
weird
sensations
in
your
head
feel
flutters
in
your
a
little
bit
of
subtle
freshman
hazing
stan
laughed
well
i
think
the
reason
i
m
nervous
is
that
i
don
t
want
anything
to
happen
to
toss
me
out
of
they
looked
toward
the
door
of
the
compartment
as
the
chief
petty
officer
stepped
inside
and
tossed
a
bunch
of
robes
on
the
seat
near
the
door
illustration
filed
into
the
pressure
wonder
why
the
robes
march
muttered
if
anything
it
s
going
to
be
too
hot
in
s
why
there
s
a
maybe
this
is
a
combination
test
stan
said
with
a
grin
they
want
to
see
if
we
can
stand
the
cpo
closed
and
fastened
securely
the
door
and
they
all
heard
someone
on
the
outside
testing
it
to
be
certain
it
was
tightly
shut
you
re
goin
to
be
out
of
here
pretty
fast
the
officer
said
to
the
students
so
don
t
fret
we
get
fifty
pounds
of
pressure
in
here
that
s
his
tone
was
casual
and
reassuring
but
none
of
the
men
sat
back
in
relaxed
positions
even
though
they
tried
to
appear
completely
at
ease
and
even
unconcerned
they
almost
jumped
when
the
cpo
banged
his
fist
lustily
against
the
end
of
the
chamber
as
a
signal
to
the
man
handling
the
valves
outside
they
jumped
again
as
a
hissing
sound
filled
the
small
compartment
the
air
was
pouring
in
and
the
men
sat
listening
to
it
in
silence
march
saw
that
the
chief
had
his
eyes
on
a
dial
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
and
he
looked
there
too
stan
noted
the
direction
of
his
glance
and
in
another
moment
every
student
was
staring
at
the
hand
that
moved
up
slowly
to
indicate
one
pound
of
pressure
then
two
pounds
then
three
pounds
the
cpo
banged
on
the
side
of
the
chamber
again
the
hissing
stopped
everyone
looked
up
in
surprise
wondering
if
there
was
something
wrong
march
glanced
around
quickly
was
one
of
the
students
too
jittery
had
a
nosebleed
started
already
but
everyone
looked
all
right
except
for
an
expression
of
worry
there
s
only
three
pounds
pressure
now
the
chief
said
even
fifty
s
not
really
a
lot
but
three
s
almost
nothing
still
just
to
give
you
an
idea
that
air
pressure
is
real
pressure
and
not
just
something
like
a
billowy
cloud
i
thought
i
d
tell
you
that
we
couldn
t
possibly
open
that
hatch
now
you
i
say
three
pounds
of
pressure
that
means
per
square
inch
there
s
about
a
ton
and
a
half
of
pressure
on
that
door
right
now
figure
out
how
much
there
is
on
with
another
bang
the
hissing
of
the
inrushing
air
began
once
more
and
the
hand
on
the
dial
began
to
creep
around
again
passing
the
figure
five
then
the
figure
ten
then
fifteen
march
began
to
feel
uncomfortably
warm
and
then
he
saw
that
most
of
the
other
men
were
beginning
to
sweat
stan
leaned
over
and
put
his
lips
close
to
march
s
ear
so
that
he
could
be
heard
over
the
sound
of
the
air
air
under
pressure
gets
hot
stan
said
remember
your
physics
it
s
the
whole
basis
of
a
diesel
engine
incidentally
but
the
pressure
is
considerably
greater
the
temperature
in
a
cylinder
gets
up
to
about
a
thousand
around
a
hundred
in
here
now
i
d
say
march
replied
in
a
loud
whisper
and
stan
nodded
in
agreement
then
he
swallowed
with
some
difficulty
and
smiled
in
some
surprise
afterward
my
ears
popped
when
i
swallowed
he
said
feels
that
s
right
boomed
the
cpo
who
had
apparently
noticed
what
stan
did
everybody
try
swallowing
a
few
times
if
your
ears
feel
march
swallowed
and
then
almost
laughed
as
he
saw
the
two
rows
of
students
earnestly
swallowing
then
he
realized
he
had
not
looked
at
the
pressure
dial
for
some
time
he
was
startled
to
see
it
at
pounds
it
was
a
good
deal
hotter
now
and
everyone
was
sweating
profusely
march
looked
around
at
the
others
carefully
forgetting
his
concern
about
himself
in
his
interest
in
the
others
there
seemed
to
be
less
tension
now
than
at
the
very
beginning
a
few
of
the
men
talked
to
each
other
comparing
their
reactions
laughing
at
the
way
their
ears
popped
expressing
surprise
at
the
increasing
heat
suddenly
there
was
another
banging
on
the
wall
of
the
chamber
and
the
hissing
stopped
everyone
s
eyes
went
to
the
pressure
dial
and
saw
the
hand
standing
at
fifty
pounds
so
this
was
it
well
it
wasn
t
so
bad
march
felt
that
way
himself
and
saw
the
same
feeling
spreading
to
all
the
others
who
smiled
slightly
as
they
knew
they
had
withstood
the
pressure
test
successfully
so
far
anyway
march
told
himself
some
things
happen
occasionally
i
guess
when
the
pressure
is
already
the
hand
on
the
dial
was
moving
downward
again
as
the
air
was
released
from
the
chamber
by
a
man
handling
the
valves
on
the
outside
march
began
to
feel
cooler
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
shivered
suddenly
better
put
on
the
robes
the
chief
said
tossing
the
robes
to
the
men
on
the
benches
the
temperature
was
up
to
a
hundred
and
thirty
for
a
while
there
and
it
drops
just
as
fast
as
the
pressure
feels
good
stan
said
as
he
slipped
into
the
robe
sure
but
i
d
like
a
couple
of
blankets
too
march
replied
feeling
his
teeth
begin
to
chatter
they
heard
another
pound
on
the
wall
and
saw
that
the
dial
hand
stood
at
ten
pounds
of
pressure
inside
we
ve
got
to
stop
it
here
for
a
while
the
cpo
explained
there
s
a
regular
rate
at
which
a
man
s
got
to
come
out
of
pressure
to
keep
from
getting
the
bends
you
probably
know
something
about
the
sailor
here
s
the
idea
your
blood
s
under
pressure
in
the
arteries
and
veins
too
just
like
the
rest
of
you
and
there
s
oxygen
and
other
things
carried
in
that
blood
when
pressure
is
reduced
too
much
too
suddenly
some
of
the
gases
in
your
blood
form
like
a
kettle
boiling
and
those
bubbles
in
your
blood
can
cause
plenty
of
stan
turned
to
march
sure
he
said
remember
those
experiments
everybody
has
in
chemistry
making
water
boil
when
you
put
it
on
a
cake
of
ice
the
water
s
under
pressure
in
a
closed
container
and
cooling
it
condenses
the
steam
vapor
so
that
pressure
is
reduced
so
the
air
forms
bubbles
which
escape
when
pressure
goes
i
remember
march
said
they
ve
got
the
bends
licked
now
though
since
they
know
just
how
fast
to
reduce
more
air
was
let
out
until
the
dial
showed
five
pounds
of
pressure
for
a
while
and
then
it
was
reduced
to
zero
the
door
was
swung
open
by
the
chief
and
the
men
stepped
out
of
the
chamber
with
smiles
on
their
faces
one
test
passed
march
said
what
s
next
the
escape
tower
stan
replied
chapter
four
underwater
escape
when
march
returned
to
his
quarters
that
afternoon
he
found
a
letter
from
scoot
bailey
waiting
for
him
it
was
full
of
excitement
and
enthusiasm
and
it
filled
march
with
a
good
deal
of
envy
i
ve
flown
already
scoot
wrote
i
didn
t
think
we
d
get
around
to
it
for
quite
a
while
but
i
got
up
the
third
day
i
was
here
of
course
i
didn
t
handle
the
plane
really
but
i
just
held
my
hand
lightly
on
the
stick
while
the
instructor
took
me
through
a
few
simple
turns
and
climbs
just
to
give
me
the
feel
of
it
he
said
and
so
i
d
know
i
really
came
here
to
fly
not
just
to
study
in
march
shook
his
head
and
to
think
that
i
ve
hardly
seen
a
submarine
he
muttered
to
himself
and
i
surely
haven
t
been
inside
one
but
scoot
s
already
been
up
in
a
plane
it
just
goes
to
show
he
told
himself
that
submarines
are
tougher
than
planes
just
think
of
the
tests
we
ve
got
to
go
through
before
they
can
even
let
us
take
a
ride
in
a
sub
with
a
flier
all
he
s
got
to
do
is
pass
a
physical
test
and
speaking
of
classes
scoot
s
letter
went
on
they
are
really
tough
remember
back
in
college
we
used
to
think
we
had
to
study
fairly
hard
boy
we
just
had
a
picnic
in
those
days
we
d
look
on
that
kind
of
business
as
a
hilarious
vacation
down
march
felt
worse
than
ever
i
m
just
wasting
time
he
complained
to
himself
not
even
a
class
yet
and
scoot
s
studying
already
he
finished
scoot
s
letter
quickly
learning
that
he
had
made
a
few
good
friends
already
that
he
felt
fine
that
he
loved
flying
then
march
sat
down
and
wrote
scoot
a
long
letter
i
ll
tell
him
about
the
pressure
chamber
march
said
i
ll
show
the
lad
that
we
re
doing
plenty
here
that
he
never
even
dreamed
of
and
i
ll
tell
him
about
the
escape
tower
we
re
going
to
have
a
try
at
tomorrow
that
ought
to
show
him
that
he
s
picked
just
an
easy
branch
of
the
so
march
wrote
and
he
told
scoot
plenty
he
made
the
test
in
the
pressure
chamber
sound
much
more
harrowing
than
it
had
actually
been
even
inventing
one
man
who
passed
out
bleeding
profusely
in
the
middle
of
the
test
then
he
felt
better
and
went
down
to
dinner
feeling
once
more
that
he
was
in
the
cream
of
the
navy
as
he
walked
down
the
hill
he
heard
the
drone
of
an
airplane
motor
overhead
simple
he
said
to
himself
see
how
easy
it
is
just
push
a
stick
this
way
or
that
just
push
a
couple
of
pedals
and
keep
your
eyes
on
a
couple
of
dozen
instruments
why
in
a
sub
we
ve
got
more
instruments
and
dials
than
in
bombing
planes
when
he
sat
down
next
to
stan
bigelow
it
was
even
better
for
stan
agreed
with
him
completely
about
the
of
the
submarine
service
thinking
up
a
few
additional
reasons
for
its
superiority
over
naval
aviation
that
had
not
occurred
to
march
then
they
began
discussing
the
escape
tower
test
the
next
day
do
you
know
much
about
this
momsen
lung
they
use
stan
asked
i
saw
some
today
when
we
took
the
pressure
test
but
i
don
t
know
the
details
of
how
they
yes
i
read
all
about
them
a
few
years
ago
march
answered
they
were
invented
by
an
annapolis
lieutenant
charles
much
more
than
ten
years
ago
and
you
know
stan
that
guy
conducted
every
single
experiment
t
let
anybody
else
take
the
boy
he
should
have
got
a
medal
for
that
stan
exclaimed
he
did
distinguished
service
medal
march
said
and
the
lung
is
one
of
the
biggest
things
ever
invented
to
make
subs
safer
like
most
good
things
the
good
thing
about
it
is
that
there
s
no
connection
at
all
with
the
outside
most
such
devices
had
a
valve
system
for
letting
the
exhaled
air
out
into
the
water
but
the
valves
jammed
often
there
s
nothing
like
that
to
go
wrong
in
the
momsen
how
does
it
get
rid
of
the
carbon
dioxide
that
you
breathe
out
stan
asked
there
s
a
can
of
co
absorbent
inside
it
that
s
all
march
explained
of
course
in
time
it
wouldn
t
absorb
any
more
but
how
long
are
you
ever
going
to
use
a
momsen
lung
at
one
stretch
anyway
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
i
suppose
stan
replied
sure
march
agreed
and
the
can
of
absorbent
can
take
care
of
your
carbon
dioxide
for
a
lot
longer
than
that
and
the
rest
of
it
is
really
just
as
simple
it
s
an
airtight
bag
that
straps
over
your
chest
there
s
a
mouthpiece
you
clamp
between
your
teeth
for
breath
and
a
nose
clip
to
close
your
nose
so
you
won
t
breathe
through
it
when
the
bag
s
filled
with
you
are
wonderful
stan
said
but
doesn
t
that
bag
of
oxygen
plus
your
own
tendency
to
float
send
you
shooting
up
to
the
surface
in
a
hurry
it
would
if
you
let
it
march
replied
that
s
why
there
always
has
to
be
a
line
or
cable
up
to
the
surface
so
you
can
hold
on
to
it
and
keep
yourself
from
ascending
too
and
get
the
bends
stan
concluded
if
anything
i
know
i
ll
go
more
slowly
than
they
tell
the
next
morning
they
had
a
chance
to
look
more
closely
at
the
momsen
lungs
before
they
put
them
on
with
the
instructor
explaining
their
workings
and
showing
the
students
how
to
adjust
them
march
did
not
see
scott
the
radioman
among
the
group
although
all
the
others
were
the
same
that
had
gone
through
the
pressure
test
the
day
before
he
spoke
to
the
young
pharmacist
asking
about
scott
got
a
cold
was
the
reply
just
a
little
nose
cold
but
they
wouldn
t
let
him
do
the
escape
test
with
too
bad
march
said
but
he
ll
be
able
to
catch
up
with
the
rest
of
us
the
chief
petty
officer
in
charge
was
explaining
the
test
to
the
men
as
they
got
into
their
swimming
trunks
first
we
ll
have
twenty
pounds
of
pressure
in
the
chamber
he
said
just
to
be
sure
noses
and
ears
are
in
good
shape
before
going
into
the
water
and
then
you
ve
got
a
long
climb
ahead
of
you
you
see
the
bottom
of
this
tower
is
a
hundred
feet
from
the
surface
at
the
top
you
won
t
be
taking
the
escape
for
quite
a
while
yet
today
we
go
up
to
the
march
thought
that
ought
to
be
simple
he
had
been
almost
that
far
beneath
the
water
sometimes
when
he
went
in
swimming
but
then
he
remembered
that
this
test
was
to
teach
the
men
the
proper
use
of
the
momsen
lung
the
rate
of
climb
up
the
cable
to
the
surface
it
wasn
t
the
pressure
at
eighteen
feet
that
would
bother
anyone
unless
it
was
somebody
who
had
some
deep
fear
of
being
under
water
such
a
person
wouldn
t
very
well
select
the
submarine
service
though
he
said
to
himself
of
course
some
people
have
these
fears
without
knowing
it
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
bring
it
out
that
s
the
time
in
the
pressure
chamber
seemed
like
nothing
after
their
session
of
the
day
before
and
soon
the
students
found
themselves
ascending
to
the
level
of
the
tower
up
at
the
top
the
chief
was
saying
there
are
plenty
of
men
ready
to
take
care
of
you
nothing
much
is
likely
to
go
wrong
with
such
a
short
escape
but
we
don
t
leave
anything
to
chance
so
if
you
get
tangled
in
the
cable
or
decide
to
go
down
instead
of
up
or
anything
like
that
there
s
a
few
mighty
good
swimmers
to
do
the
rescue
act
there
s
one
thing
to
send
you
men
up
one
after
the
other
pretty
fast
just
the
way
you
d
be
doin
it
if
you
were
getting
out
of
a
sub
lyin
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
so
get
away
from
the
cable
buoy
fast
and
without
kickin
your
legs
all
over
the
place
you
re
likely
to
kick
the
next
one
in
the
head
especially
if
he
has
come
up
a
little
too
how
fast
are
we
supposed
to
go
chief
one
of
the
men
asked
about
a
foot
per
second
the
officer
replied
you
hold
yourself
parallel
with
the
cable
body
away
from
it
a
little
bit
and
let
yourself
up
hand
over
hand
you
can
put
your
hands
about
a
foot
above
each
other
and
count
off
the
seconds
to
yourself
we
ll
be
timing
you
at
both
ends
so
you
ll
find
out
afterwards
whether
you
went
too
fast
or
too
slow
then
you
ll
catch
on
to
the
rate
all
march
was
among
the
first
men
who
stepped
into
the
bell
at
the
level
the
water
of
the
tower
came
up
to
his
hips
and
was
kept
from
going
higher
in
the
little
compartment
by
the
pressure
of
the
air
forced
into
the
top
of
the
room
he
saw
a
round
metal
pipe
shaped
like
a
very
large
chimney
extending
down
into
the
water
that
skirt
goes
down
a
little
below
the
water
level
in
here
on
the
platform
the
chief
said
when
you
go
up
you
fasten
on
your
lung
duck
under
the
skirt
and
go
straight
up
first
i
m
going
to
check
to
be
sure
that
the
cable
s
set
march
and
the
others
watched
closely
as
the
chief
adjusted
his
nose
clips
and
mouthpiece
deftly
turned
the
valve
opening
the
oxygen
into
the
mouthpiece
and
ducked
under
in
a
moment
he
reappeared
and
removed
the
lung
all
set
he
said
okay
he
pointed
to
the
young
pharmacist
you
go
first
your
lung
s
filled
with
oxygen
plenty
of
it
there
s
the
carbon
dioxide
absorbent
in
there
to
take
up
everything
you
breathe
out
remember
to
go
up
hand
over
hand
about
a
foot
per
second
and
don
t
be
surprised
if
a
couple
of
guys
go
floatin
past
you
in
the
water
on
your
way
up
there
re
other
instructors
swimmin
around
up
there
and
once
in
a
while
one
of
em
swims
down
to
see
how
you
re
makin
out
all
set
yes
chief
the
pharmacist
answered
march
thought
he
looked
completely
calm
though
he
felt
himself
growing
excited
at
even
this
short
escape
okay
mouthpiece
in
place
the
chief
said
making
sure
that
the
student
did
it
correctly
now
nose
clips
s
right
finally
open
the
valve
so
you
can
get
the
oxygen
okay
the
pharmacist
nodded
that
he
was
all
right
on
your
way
then
my
lad
the
chief
said
duck
march
watched
the
young
man
duck
under
the
water
and
disappear
as
he
went
under
the
metal
skirt
then
he
saw
the
chief
go
under
too
right
behind
him
up
above
he
knew
the
instructors
would
see
a
tug
on
the
yellow
buoy
fastened
to
the
cable
and
would
begin
their
timing
of
the
first
ascent
one
of
them
would
dive
down
and
have
a
look
at
the
student
coming
up
would
make
him
pull
away
if
he
were
hugging
the
cable
too
closely
speed
him
up
or
slow
him
down
if
necessary
with
a
gesture
and
a
pat
on
the
shoulder
suddenly
the
chief
reappeared
illustration
over
hand
he
okay
you
he
said
pointing
to
march
as
he
put
the
mouthpiece
in
place
he
thought
how
strange
it
was
that
in
the
tower
in
a
pair
of
swimming
trunks
he
was
just
plain
you
to
the
chief
petty
officer
while
in
uniform
outside
he
would
be
right
now
march
thought
as
he
adjusted
the
nose
clips
and
turned
the
valve
this
man
s
my
superior
and
my
teacher
a
young
officer
can
learn
plenty
from
these
boys
who
ve
had
so
much
experience
if
they
give
themselves
a
chance
by
forgetting
for
a
few
minutes
that
they
re
commissioned
as
the
chief
patted
his
shoulder
march
ducked
under
the
water
found
the
bottom
of
the
round
metal
skirt
and
went
under
it
looking
up
he
saw
the
long
shaft
of
darkness
made
by
the
walls
of
the
tower
and
the
filmy
cloudy
circle
of
at
the
surface
which
suddenly
seemed
a
great
distance
away
his
hands
had
already
found
the
cable
and
he
held
on
to
it
as
he
felt
the
upward
tug
of
the
lung
which
tried
to
carry
him
swiftly
to
the
top
putting
one
hand
about
a
foot
above
the
other
he
began
to
count
to
himself
hoping
that
his
counts
were
about
a
second
apart
for
every
count
he
put
his
hand
up
what
he
judged
to
be
another
foot
in
distance
then
he
realized
that
his
legs
were
unconsciously
starting
to
twine
themselves
around
the
cable
and
he
pulled
them
away
holding
his
body
straight
up
and
down
a
short
distance
away
from
the
escape
line
that
s
funny
he
told
himself
i
guess
i
always
twined
my
legs
around
a
rope
when
i
was
going
down
it
so
i
want
to
do
the
same
thing
going
he
looked
up
again
quickly
and
saw
legs
kicking
above
him
that
would
be
the
pharmacist
pulling
away
from
the
buoy
how
much
farther
did
he
have
to
go
it
was
hard
to
judge
the
distance
he
had
reached
a
count
of
nine
so
he
should
be
halfway
if
he
had
been
putting
his
hands
a
foot
apart
his
eyes
blinked
at
a
form
moving
up
close
to
him
he
saw
a
man
in
trunks
floating
toward
him
in
the
water
waving
his
arms
slowly
no
he
wasn
t
was
swimming
he
wore
a
pair
of
nose
clips
but
no
momsen
lung
one
of
the
instructors
from
above
march
concluded
the
man
motioned
his
arms
upward
urgently
unmistakably
march
knew
that
he
had
been
going
too
slowly
so
he
increased
the
tempo
of
his
count
slightly
and
before
he
knew
it
his
eyes
blinked
in
the
sunlight
and
he
felt
water
running
down
his
face
he
was
up
clips
off
valve
off
an
instructor
in
the
water
beside
him
said
march
moved
away
from
the
buoy
toward
the
side
of
the
tank
where
he
saw
other
men
standing
on
the
little
platform
and
as
he
did
so
he
removed
his
nose
clips
with
one
hand
shut
the
oxygen
valve
then
he
remembered
that
it
had
not
felt
a
bit
strange
to
breathe
through
his
mouth
instead
of
through
his
nose
i
guess
as
long
as
your
lungs
get
the
oxygen
they
need
you
don
t
much
care
how
it
gets
he
felt
a
hand
helping
him
as
he
climbed
up
on
the
little
platform
at
the
top
of
the
tower
standing
there
he
removed
the
mouthpiece
and
then
took
off
the
lung
itself
as
he
dried
himself
and
slipped
into
his
robe
the
man
behind
him
broke
the
surface
and
started
toward
the
edge
suddenly
march
felt
a
little
dizzy
he
had
looked
out
the
window
and
had
seen
how
high
he
was
from
the
ground
and
then
he
smiled
what
would
scoot
think
of
me
he
thought
getting
dizzy
even
for
a
second
only
a
hundred
feet
off
the
ground
down
below
was
the
river
and
march
saw
a
sub
making
its
way
down
toward
long
island
sound
it
looked
very
tiny
and
slim
how
did
it
go
sir
asked
a
voice
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
the
pharmacist
all
right
i
guess
march
replied
didn
t
mind
it
anyway
i
guess
i
was
a
little
slow
they
had
to
send
a
man
down
to
hurry
me
they
sent
one
down
to
slow
me
down
the
pharmacist
said
but
i
came
out
just
about
right
they
told
me
it
was
a
better
sign
if
you
went
too
slow
than
too
i
suppose
it
indicates
you
re
not
overanxious
about
being
under
water
march
said
a
familiar
head
broke
the
water
of
the
tank
and
march
saw
stan
bigelow
moving
over
toward
the
platform
when
he
had
got
out
and
removed
his
lung
he
smiled
at
march
nothing
to
it
was
there
he
called
i
d
like
to
try
the
level
right
same
here
march
said
but
i
guess
we
wait
a
day
or
later
when
they
make
the
escape
they
found
that
it
went
just
the
same
as
the
sure
it
took
fifty
seconds
but
the
sensations
were
about
the
same
there
was
more
pressure
on
the
ears
but
not
enough
to
bother
anyone
march
was
very
surprised
to
hear
that
one
of
the
enlisted
men
near
the
end
of
the
group
had
suddenly
gone
panicky
just
before
it
was
his
turn
to
go
had
he
gone
through
the
test
all
right
march
asked
the
chief
petty
officer
in
charge
too
fast
the
man
replied
but
lots
of
them
do
that
at
first
he
must
have
been
holding
himself
under
control
for
that
one
though
and
the
thought
of
the
fifty
was
too
much
for
too
bad
march
said
will
they
transfer
him
back
to
his
old
branch
of
the
service
ve
decided
to
give
him
another
chance
the
chief
said
the
psychological
it
s
just
a
fear
the
guy
never
even
knew
he
had
he
s
goin
to
talk
to
him
a
bit
to
see
if
he
can
find
out
what
caused
it
then
maybe
he
can
get
rid
of
it
he
won
t
be
able
to
go
down
in
a
pigboat
until
he
handles
the
escape
okay
but
we
ll
keep
him
on
for
a
while
to
give
him
another
crack
at
it
good
man
in
every
other
way
as
far
as
i
can
march
learned
later
that
the
man
was
one
of
the
fire
controlmen
who
had
ridden
out
on
the
bus
with
him
gee
i
hope
he
makes
it
scott
the
radioman
said
to
march
when
they
talked
it
over
he
s
a
swell
guy
cobden
s
his
name
marty
cobden
and
he
s
got
his
heart
set
on
bein
a
submariner
dreams
about
it
at
night
even
never
had
the
faintest
notion
he
was
scared
of
anything
least
of
all
just
fifty
feet
of
did
he
go
swimming
much
march
asked
i
asked
him
that
too
scott
replied
he
says
he
liked
to
swim
but
he
didn
t
like
to
dive
but
he
wasn
t
of
it
scott
had
got
over
his
cold
and
had
caught
up
with
the
rest
of
them
making
the
and
escapes
without
difficulty
well
we
re
qualified
now
to
go
to
school
here
march
said
and
we
can
even
go
down
in
a
sub
but
when
do
we
take
the
escape
don
t
have
to
scott
said
but
most
of
em
try
it
time
later
they
all
want
to
see
minnie
and
minnie
and
winnie
march
asked
who
are
they
and
are
they
they
re
mermaids
scott
said
without
a
smile
beautiful
mermaids
and
they
re
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
tank
down
at
the
level
only
one
way
to
see
that
s
to
make
the
escape
an
you
get
a
diploma
when
you
ve
done
i
ll
see
you
there
scott
march
said
we
ll
both
have
a
look
at
winnie
and
minnie
one
of
these
chapter
five
first
dive
the
next
day
classes
started
for
march
and
stan
and
the
other
new
officers
going
through
the
school
expecting
the
most
difficult
and
intensive
of
studies
march
was
a
little
disappointed
in
the
first
day
s
work
just
ground
work
i
suppose
he
said
to
stan
at
mess
that
evening
they
couldn
t
start
throwing
the
whole
book
at
us
on
the
first
i
think
they
did
pretty
well
stan
said
i
got
a
big
dose
of
the
history
and
development
of
the
submarine
and
the
construction
of
modern
pigboats
back
in
college
we
d
have
taken
a
week
to
cover
what
we
got
in
this
one
day
but
of
course
you
ve
read
a
lot
of
general
stuff
about
subs
i
was
so
busy
studying
engineering
in
college
i
didn
t
look
at
anything
yes
i
read
a
good
deal
about
the
underwater
ships
march
said
i
always
did
think
those
first
experimenters
had
a
lot
of
guts
imagine
that
dutchman
van
drebel
submerging
a
boat
more
than
three
hundred
years
sure
and
he
stayed
down
two
hours
stan
agreed
made
about
two
oars
for
power
he
must
have
been
a
clever
guy
to
have
those
oars
sticking
out
through
leather
openings
sealed
so
tight
that
not
a
drop
of
water
could
come
in
march
said
but
it
was
the
americans
who
really
made
submarines
t
there
a
ship
named
after
bushnell
stan
asked
the
man
who
made
that
submarine
during
the
american
revolution
sure
a
submarine
tender
naturally
march
replied
too
bad
his
idea
didn
t
work
better
it
was
a
clever
i
had
never
realized
until
today
stan
said
that
robert
fulton
had
anything
to
do
with
submarines
i
thought
inventing
the
steamboat
was
enough
for
any
one
man
but
now
i
find
out
he
invented
pretty
good
submarines
long
before
he
did
the
steamboat
but
he
just
couldn
t
get
anybody
to
listen
to
well
the
sub
really
couldn
t
develop
into
a
reliable
ship
march
said
until
electric
motors
and
storage
batteries
came
along
there
were
some
pretty
good
attempts
of
course
and
john
holland
and
simon
lake
the
two
americans
who
really
made
subs
that
worked
turned
out
some
fair
ones
driven
by
gasoline
engines
steam
engines
and
compressed
and
don
t
forget
the
diesels
stan
laughed
my
sweethearts
the
diesels
they
were
the
last
things
needed
after
storage
batteries
and
electric
motors
to
make
subs
really
dependable
and
i
won
t
forget
your
diesels
stan
march
said
i
m
going
to
have
to
learn
plenty
about
them
in
the
next
few
weeks
and
i
know
almost
nothing
now
and
you
ve
got
to
learn
plenty
about
other
things
sure
it
ll
be
tough
going
stan
said
but
it
s
a
wonderful
idea
to
have
every
officer
no
matter
what
his
specialty
able
to
take
over
almost
any
department
on
a
sub
if
he
has
yes
if
i
get
knocked
cold
just
when
we
re
trying
to
slip
away
through
some
coral
atolls
to
miss
a
attack
march
asked
won
t
you
be
glad
you
really
learned
how
to
navigate
why
all
navy
men
know
how
to
navigate
stan
protested
i
know
my
navigation
pretty
maybe
so
march
agreed
but
do
you
know
it
well
enough
to
take
a
ship
a
few
hundred
miles
under
water
without
ever
a
chance
to
look
at
the
horizon
or
shoot
the
sun
or
get
a
fix
on
some
landmark
i
know
i
couldn
t
do
it
and
navigation
s
been
my
main
job
so
navigating
a
sub
s
no
bed
of
roses
of
course
stan
said
but
nursing
my
pretty
diesels
is
no
easy
task
either
when
you
re
workin
on
those
babies
you
pay
attention
and
be
good
to
i
ll
be
good
to
your
diesels
all
right
march
laughed
but
what
i
m
most
anxious
to
learn
about
are
all
the
new
devices
pretty
secret
stuff
some
of
it
though
we
ve
had
some
of
it
on
our
surface
i
know
stan
said
you
don
t
feel
so
blind
and
lost
in
a
sub
any
more
i
guess
you
can
tell
from
the
sound
devices
just
how
many
ships
are
near
by
and
even
from
the
sound
of
their
engines
what
kind
they
are
where
they
re
goin
and
how
fast
but
you
know
what
i
m
anxious
to
get
inside
a
pigboat
and
look
around
those
charts
are
fine
but
there
s
nothing
like
seeing
the
real
thing
for
i
think
they
ll
be
taking
us
down
for
a
dive
within
a
couple
of
days
march
said
just
for
the
ride
you
know
and
to
see
how
we
react
and
it
had
better
be
pretty
soon
that
scoot
bailey
has
probably
been
up
in
a
plane
half
a
dozen
times
at
least
and
i
haven
t
seen
the
inside
of
a
sub
the
next
morning
they
looked
for
an
announcement
that
they
would
go
down
in
one
of
the
subs
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
they
spent
their
time
in
the
classrooms
and
they
began
the
really
intensive
work
that
march
had
been
expecting
one
day
of
preliminary
stuff
was
enough
i
guess
he
said
to
stan
at
lunch
they
really
put
us
to
work
this
the
classrooms
and
laboratories
of
the
were
in
the
same
building
as
those
of
the
enlisted
men
officers
and
men
alike
had
gone
through
the
same
preliminary
tests
but
now
their
paths
separated
march
saw
the
men
regularly
of
course
in
the
halls
and
around
the
grounds
he
stopped
and
chatted
once
in
a
while
with
scott
the
radioman
who
struck
him
more
and
more
as
a
pleasant
and
serious
young
man
ideally
suited
to
submarine
work
he
saw
the
pharmacist
sallini
and
also
marty
cobden
the
fellow
who
had
gone
to
pieces
at
the
level
in
the
escape
tower
he
was
going
at
his
studies
like
a
demon
as
if
to
make
up
in
some
way
for
his
one
failure
to
date
march
and
stan
saw
them
that
very
afternoon
again
when
they
reported
according
to
instructions
to
one
of
the
chief
petty
officers
at
the
sub
base
below
the
school
buildings
wonder
what
s
up
stan
said
something
for
officers
and
men
alike
whatever
it
there
s
only
one
thing
left
of
that
sort
exclaimed
march
happily
that
s
our
first
pigboat
ride
come
on
stan
stan
noticed
that
there
were
only
about
a
dozen
enlisted
men
gathered
together
rather
than
the
whole
class
why
only
some
of
them
he
wondered
sub
won
t
hold
many
more
in
addition
to
the
regular
crew
march
said
and
now
these
boys
are
really
beginning
to
team
up
you
know
how
we
ve
had
it
drilled
into
us
already
that
teamwork
is
the
most
important
part
of
submarining
well
they
ve
started
to
put
their
teams
together
this
bunch
is
a
diving
enough
men
for
one
shift
on
a
sub
to
handle
everything
that
needs
to
be
handled
they
ll
work
together
all
through
the
course
get
to
know
each
other
to
work
well
what
if
one
of
the
men
fails
the
course
stan
asked
there
s
marty
cobden
for
instance
if
he
doesn
t
manage
to
overcome
that
fear
of
the
escape
tower
he
s
then
they
ll
have
to
replace
him
march
said
but
that
will
be
just
one
man
out
of
the
maybe
two
at
most
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
well
the
majority
of
the
team
is
still
intact
the
new
man
can
fit
into
a
team
pretty
will
they
eventually
go
out
on
duty
together
stan
asked
probably
march
replied
when
a
sub
gets
three
diving
sections
that
have
trained
together
then
it
s
got
a
real
crew
of
course
they
usually
try
to
put
in
just
one
new
section
with
two
old
ones
men
who
ve
been
through
the
ropes
the
new
section
already
used
to
teamwork
fits
in
with
the
experienced
men
well
and
learns
so
much
from
them
that
they
re
veterans
after
one
what
about
us
officers
though
stan
wondered
maybe
there
s
a
chance
we
ll
go
on
the
same
maybe
march
agreed
they
may
put
two
new
officers
on
a
sub
with
three
or
four
veterans
probably
no
more
though
look
here
comes
the
chief
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
all
walking
down
toward
the
docks
where
the
old
submarines
used
as
trainers
lay
bobbing
gently
in
the
waters
of
the
thames
river
march
saw
that
some
of
the
crew
were
busy
about
the
deck
of
one
of
the
subs
to
which
a
narrow
gangplank
led
from
the
dock
as
they
walked
the
chief
petty
officer
was
talking
to
the
students
when
it
s
in
the
water
he
said
you
can
t
see
much
of
a
sub
the
flat
deck
is
just
a
superstructure
built
up
on
top
of
the
hull
you
can
see
part
of
the
hull
itself
where
the
superstructure
sides
slope
down
into
it
but
most
of
it
s
under
water
where
it
ought
to
be
on
a
march
s
eyes
were
going
over
the
long
slim
craft
swiftly
not
missing
a
detail
he
saw
the
fins
on
the
side
at
bow
and
stern
folded
back
now
but
able
to
be
extended
so
as
to
make
the
planes
which
could
guide
the
ship
up
or
down
he
noted
the
looming
conning
tower
which
served
as
a
bridge
for
the
officers
when
the
pigboat
traveled
on
the
surface
from
there
he
knew
a
hatch
led
down
into
the
center
section
of
the
ship
he
saw
too
that
the
fore
and
aft
hatches
were
open
one
leading
down
into
the
torpedo
room
and
another
into
the
engine
room
look
at
the
deck
gun
stan
said
wicked
looking
little
illustration
watched
from
the
he
pointed
to
the
gun
mounted
on
the
flat
deck
forward
of
the
conning
tower
it
was
tightly
covered
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
canvas
cover
march
knew
that
the
crew
could
have
that
cover
off
and
the
gun
in
action
in
a
matter
of
seconds
march
and
stan
walked
across
the
gangplank
and
looked
up
at
the
officer
on
the
bridge
of
the
conning
tower
saluting
they
reported
and
received
a
welcoming
smile
and
the
words
come
on
up
they
scrambled
up
the
ladder
and
found
themselves
on
the
crowded
bridge
with
two
other
men
i
m
lieutenant
commander
sutherland
said
the
man
who
had
greeted
them
executive
he
turned
to
the
other
officer
on
the
deck
captain
anson
and
ensign
bigelow
the
captain
smiled
as
he
returned
their
salute
and
then
lapsed
into
his
customary
informal
role
glad
to
have
you
aboard
he
said
first
ride
eh
yes
sir
march
and
stan
replied
feeling
at
ease
at
once
in
the
old
veteran
s
presence
sutherland
will
show
you
around
after
we
get
started
the
skipper
said
i
imagine
you
ll
want
to
stay
up
here
till
we
re
under
sutherland
turned
to
them
you
probably
know
from
your
studies
what
most
of
this
is
about
he
said
just
a
matter
of
seeing
and
feeling
it
to
be
at
home
i
know
i
don
t
have
to
tell
you
every
little
detail
the
way
the
chief
down
there
is
pointing
out
every
steel
plate
to
those
march
and
stan
glanced
down
to
see
that
the
chief
had
led
his
enlisted
men
on
to
the
deck
of
the
submarine
where
they
were
mingling
with
the
regular
crew
who
were
preparing
to
cast
off
when
the
captain
ordered
whenever
you
want
to
know
anything
sutherland
went
on
just
ask
me
and
i
ll
try
to
give
you
the
answer
i
imagine
we
ll
be
casting
off
in
a
they
saw
the
chief
petty
officer
leading
his
students
down
the
hatch
to
the
interior
of
the
submarine
and
for
a
moment
march
wanted
to
join
them
that
will
come
later
he
said
it
s
important
to
see
them
cast
and
that
operation
came
without
delay
at
a
word
from
the
captain
the
executive
officer
began
barking
orders
to
the
crew
and
to
the
enlisted
men
who
stood
at
the
controls
on
the
bridge
the
gangplank
was
taken
away
by
men
on
the
dock
the
electric
motors
began
to
turn
in
the
ship
far
below
them
and
lines
were
cast
off
slowly
trembling
slightly
beneath
their
feet
the
pigboat
slid
back
into
the
river
away
from
the
shore
churning
up
the
water
only
slightly
as
it
moved
then
suddenly
with
a
roar
the
diesels
caught
hold
and
white
smoke
poured
from
the
exhaust
vents
on
the
sides
of
the
boat
stan
grinned
as
he
heard
them
and
march
said
makes
you
feel
at
home
to
hear
them
doesn
t
it
he
a
diesel
man
sutherland
asked
he
dreams
about
them
march
replied
i
think
he
s
going
to
marry
a
diesel
some
day
the
pigboat
was
now
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
swinging
about
to
head
downstream
on
the
deck
below
there
remained
only
a
few
men
of
the
regular
crew
needed
for
duties
there
march
looked
around
feeling
the
thrill
of
pleasure
that
always
came
when
a
ship
set
out
the
cool
breeze
fanned
his
face
and
he
looked
at
the
shore
slipping
by
then
the
buildings
of
the
city
it
seemed
only
a
short
while
before
they
were
in
the
choppy
open
water
of
the
sound
here
there
were
almost
no
other
ships
and
the
waters
were
deep
soon
they
would
dive
below
he
knew
the
regular
crew
were
at
their
stations
with
the
students
looking
specialist
observing
the
work
he
would
one
day
do
himself
engine
men
were
in
the
crowded
engine
room
peering
eagerly
at
the
huge
diesels
which
powered
the
ship
on
the
surface
scott
the
radioman
would
be
standing
beside
the
regular
radioman
and
sallini
would
be
going
over
supplies
and
equipment
of
the
regular
pharmacist
while
keeping
his
eye
out
for
everything
else
he
could
learn
too
every
crew
member
had
his
special
duties
but
every
one
had
to
be
able
to
take
over
the
duties
of
any
other
in
an
emergency
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
they
all
liked
submarine
work
officers
and
men
alike
they
learned
so
much
in
so
many
different
fields
in
such
a
short
time
rig
ship
for
diving
said
the
captain
quietly
and
sutherland
who
served
also
as
diving
officer
spoke
the
order
into
the
interphone
on
the
bridge
throughout
the
ship
below
march
and
stan
knew
men
had
sprung
to
their
stations
in
every
compartment
the
cook
was
securing
the
sink
stove
pots
and
pans
men
at
the
huge
levers
controlling
the
valves
of
the
ballast
tanks
tested
them
the
diving
planes
were
rigged
out
below
on
the
deck
the
last
of
the
crew
slid
down
the
hatches
and
made
them
fast
from
the
inside
then
the
reports
began
to
come
back
over
the
phone
that
all
was
ready
inside
the
boat
an
officer
in
the
control
room
below
heard
the
different
rooms
of
the
submarine
check
in
one
by
one
torpedo
room
rigged
for
diving
engine
room
rigged
for
diving
when
all
rooms
had
reported
the
officer
below
phoned
to
the
captain
on
the
bridge
that
the
ship
was
rigged
for
diving
all
right
mister
anson
and
mister
you
go
march
quickly
moved
to
the
opening
and
slid
down
it
his
feet
reaching
for
the
steps
of
the
straight
steel
ladder
he
was
followed
at
once
by
stan
and
then
by
sutherland
next
came
the
enlisted
man
who
had
stood
at
the
controls
on
the
bridge
and
finally
the
captain
himself
the
hatch
was
made
fast
behind
him
and
everyone
was
inside
the
boat
march
glanced
around
him
quickly
and
despite
the
number
of
drawings
and
pictures
he
had
seen
of
the
control
room
of
a
submarine
he
gasped
never
had
he
seen
such
a
myriad
of
instruments
and
wheels
and
levers
and
dials
everything
in
the
entire
submarine
was
really
controlled
from
this
one
central
room
beside
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
were
the
two
thick
steel
shafts
which
he
knew
were
the
periscopes
their
lower
ends
were
down
in
wells
in
the
deck
and
would
not
be
raised
until
after
they
were
submerged
and
the
skipper
wanted
to
look
around
facing
the
bow
of
the
ship
march
saw
the
forward
bulkhead
of
the
control
room
yes
there
was
the
huge
steering
wheel
with
the
helmsman
holding
it
lightly
it
seemed
strange
for
a
helmsman
to
be
looking
at
a
wall
or
instrument
panels
on
a
wall
rather
than
at
the
open
sea
over
which
he
steered
march
knew
that
the
controls
were
electrically
operated
by
the
wheel
and
thus
easy
to
handle
but
every
man
was
made
to
steer
it
by
hand
on
that
took
real
strength
order
to
be
ready
for
that
emergency
that
might
come
when
the
electric
current
failed
forward
also
were
the
wheels
controlling
the
angles
of
the
diving
planes
there
was
the
dial
and
near
by
the
little
table
at
which
the
navigation
officer
sat
some
day
that
s
where
i
ll
be
march
said
to
himself
he
didn
t
have
time
to
look
carefully
at
the
many
other
dials
against
this
wall
but
he
knew
they
showed
the
ship
s
depth
under
water
the
pressure
and
other
essential
data
along
the
sides
were
still
more
dials
showing
the
amount
of
fuel
in
tanks
the
number
of
revolutions
per
minute
being
made
by
the
propellers
he
recognized
the
inclinometer
which
showed
just
exactly
the
angle
of
tip
assumed
by
the
boat
in
diving
or
coming
up
on
another
side
were
the
long
levers
and
wheels
controlling
the
big
kingston
valves
which
flooded
the
ballast
tanks
with
sea
water
when
the
ship
was
to
dive
the
air
vents
the
pumps
and
other
equipment
used
in
diving
and
surfacing
the
regular
crew
stood
tensely
at
their
posts
without
a
word
and
the
students
who
stood
near
by
were
completely
silent
march
glanced
at
the
skipper
and
saw
that
he
was
looking
at
a
huge
panel
on
one
wall
yes
this
was
the
christmas
tree
it
was
a
large
electric
indicator
board
covered
with
red
and
green
lights
it
showed
the
exact
condition
of
every
air
induction
vents
and
the
ship
everything
having
anything
to
do
with
diving
had
its
indicator
there
on
the
board
march
saw
that
most
of
the
lights
were
green
but
many
were
still
red
he
knew
that
every
light
had
to
be
green
before
the
ship
could
dive
stand
by
for
diving
said
the
skipper
in
a
quiet
voice
sutherland
standing
behind
him
sang
out
stand
by
for
diving
the
telephone
orderly
repeated
the
order
over
the
interphone
to
all
parts
of
the
ship
and
march
jumped
as
the
klaxon
horns
blared
out
their
raucous
warnings
for
a
moment
their
sound
reverberated
in
the
small
steel
room
and
then
sutherland
barked
new
orders
open
main
ballast
kingstons
march
saw
the
men
move
the
levers
as
he
repeated
the
order
and
a
few
lights
turned
to
green
on
the
christmas
stop
main
engines
the
order
was
repeated
over
the
phone
to
the
engine
room
march
felt
the
trembling
of
the
ship
stop
as
the
diesels
were
shut
off
and
the
electric
motors
switched
on
again
taking
their
current
from
the
huge
banks
of
storage
batteries
under
the
deck
of
the
ship
at
the
same
time
other
lights
turned
to
green
on
the
board
open
main
ballast
vents
called
sutherland
one
after
another
the
necessary
orders
were
called
by
the
diving
officer
they
were
carried
out
with
precision
and
reported
back
at
once
finally
the
last
red
lights
on
the
board
winked
out
as
the
main
air
induction
valves
were
closed
then
sutherland
ordered
as
the
last
test
that
air
be
released
from
the
tank
into
the
interior
of
the
ship
march
watched
him
look
at
the
dial
indicating
air
pressure
within
the
ship
the
hand
moved
up
a
little
then
held
steady
this
showed
that
there
was
no
leakage
of
air
from
the
boat
sutherland
turned
to
the
skipper
pressure
in
the
light
take
her
down
said
the
captain
with
a
nod
when
the
diving
officer
repeated
the
order
the
klaxons
blared
again
their
final
warning
before
the
diving
officer
called
out
one
order
after
another
march
had
been
able
to
keep
close
track
of
everything
up
to
this
point
but
suddenly
just
at
the
crucial
moment
there
was
too
much
going
on
he
heard
an
order
that
sounded
like
down
bow
planes
and
felt
the
ship
tip
forward
slightly
but
at
the
same
time
he
heard
the
roar
of
water
as
it
rushed
into
the
ballast
tanks
between
the
inner
and
outer
steel
hulls
of
the
ship
the
rush
of
air
forced
out
of
the
vents
by
the
inrushing
water
and
the
whine
of
the
electric
motors
sutherland
gave
an
order
about
the
trim
tanks
which
march
did
not
catch
then
heard
the
skipper
say
steady
at
forty
as
the
order
was
repeated
march
found
the
dial
which
indicated
the
ship
s
depth
and
saw
the
hand
approach
the
forty
mark
there
the
ship
leveled
out
again
the
sound
of
rushing
water
and
bubbling
air
had
ceased
and
the
only
sound
was
the
steady
hum
of
the
motors
we
re
down
stan
muttered
almost
to
himself
march
had
almost
forgotten
his
companion
s
existence
but
now
he
turned
to
him
that
s
right
he
said
i
was
so
intent
on
what
was
happening
i
almost
forgot
about
that
there
s
nothing
special
about
it
is
there
i
here
in
this
room
where
you
can
t
see
doesn
t
make
much
difference
whether
you
re
on
top
of
the
water
or
underneath
only
when
i
heard
the
water
rushing
into
the
ballasts
stan
answered
then
i
had
a
little
sensation
of
going
under
water
it
was
fast
wasn
t
it
so
fast
i
couldn
t
keep
track
of
everything
march
replied
i
wonder
how
long
it
took
from
the
time
the
captain
ordered
the
dive
until
we
leveled
off
at
forty
sutherland
overheard
him
just
seconds
he
said
chapter
six
a
real
submariner
scoot
bailey
never
will
have
an
experience
like
this
as
long
as
he
lives
march
said
to
himself
he
was
peering
through
the
periscope
of
the
submerged
pigboat
looking
over
the
tossing
waters
of
the
sea
when
the
captain
had
called
up
periscope
the
long
shaft
had
moved
up
by
electric
motor
until
the
eyepiece
and
handles
were
at
convenient
height
the
skipper
had
a
look
around
and
march
noticed
that
he
turned
the
handles
to
adjust
the
focus
here
have
a
look
mister
anson
he
said
standing
away
so
march
had
fitted
his
eyes
against
the
rubber
cup
and
looked
he
saw
water
a
long
stretch
of
open
water
with
nothing
on
it
it
was
not
completely
sharp
so
he
turned
one
handle
slightly
saw
the
image
fuzz
up
turned
it
the
other
way
until
it
came
sharp
next
he
moved
the
periscope
around
stepping
with
it
as
he
did
so
looking
over
the
horizon
in
a
sweeping
arc
then
he
saw
something
it
was
the
shore
of
long
island
almost
two
miles
away
he
stepped
back
and
said
i
saw
the
long
island
shore
i
think
how
far
can
one
see
through
the
periscope
sir
about
two
and
a
half
miles
the
skipper
replied
have
a
look
mister
stan
stepped
forward
eagerly
to
look
through
the
scope
he
swung
it
around
in
a
different
direction
from
which
march
had
moved
and
suddenly
exclaimed
a
ship
the
captain
took
over
for
a
look
then
said
yes
small
freighter
just
think
how
easily
we
could
sink
her
march
looked
at
the
ship
looks
as
though
i
could
knock
her
down
with
a
bb
gun
he
said
on
later
trips
we
ll
simulate
attacks
on
some
of
the
ships
in
the
sound
the
skipper
said
so
you
ll
get
a
chance
to
practice
something
a
little
more
powerful
than
a
bb
for
fifteen
minutes
the
pigboat
traveled
under
the
water
sutherland
took
stan
and
march
around
the
control
room
explaining
the
various
instruments
and
levers
answering
their
questions
what
beats
me
sir
stan
said
is
the
number
of
different
things
you
have
to
remember
i
just
can
t
conceive
of
doing
all
that
so
fast
and
not
forgetting
a
it
seems
like
that
at
first
sutherland
said
but
after
you
do
it
a
few
times
you
get
used
to
it
just
a
car
is
pretty
complicated
if
you
ve
never
even
seen
a
car
before
you
ve
got
to
see
the
emergency
brakes
are
on
that
transmission
s
in
neutral
then
turn
on
ignition
step
on
electric
starter
perhaps
choke
it
a
little
to
start
then
push
back
choke
step
on
foot
throttle
warm
up
engine
release
emergency
brake
push
in
clutch
move
gearshift
lever
let
in
clutch
step
on
throttle
shove
in
clutch
take
foot
from
throttle
move
gearshift
lever
in
another
direction
let
in
clutch
and
step
on
throttle
for
a
time
then
shove
in
clutch
take
foot
from
throttle
move
gearshift
lever
let
in
clutch
step
on
throttle
again
and
all
this
time
steer
the
car
where
you
re
going
watch
out
for
pedestrians
for
traffic
lights
for
cars
behind
for
cars
on
side
streets
why
there
are
dozens
of
things
you
have
to
do
but
when
you
ve
driven
a
car
a
little
while
most
of
them
are
almost
i
d
never
though
of
it
that
way
stan
said
but
it
must
take
quite
a
while
of
handling
a
dive
to
get
used
to
not
so
long
as
you
think
sutherland
said
if
you
re
any
good
at
all
if
not
you
wouldn
t
be
here
and
don
t
you
leave
this
school
you
ll
be
able
to
take
her
three
or
four
different
worrying
about
it
for
a
the
executive
officer
then
led
them
through
the
rest
of
the
boat
giving
them
a
quick
of
the
entire
ship
during
their
first
trip
stepping
over
the
high
door
edges
of
the
bulkhead
doors
leading
from
one
compartment
to
another
march
realized
that
a
fat
man
would
have
difficulty
getting
around
on
a
submarine
he
noted
how
the
doors
could
be
fastened
watertight
and
airtight
so
that
any
compartment
could
be
sealed
off
from
all
the
others
they
saw
the
engine
room
with
its
two
banks
of
heavy
diesels
now
quiet
and
at
rest
as
the
ship
traveled
under
water
stan
would
have
stayed
there
for
the
entire
trip
talking
to
the
engineers
and
looking
over
the
power
plants
but
they
moved
on
to
the
motor
room
where
the
whine
of
the
two
electric
motors
was
loud
and
march
knew
that
the
motors
could
be
switched
to
act
as
generators
driven
by
the
diesels
when
the
ship
surfaced
charging
the
batteries
the
battery
room
did
not
hold
their
attention
for
long
although
the
two
banks
of
huge
cells
were
impressive
but
the
torpedo
room
fascinated
them
here
was
the
real
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
entire
ship
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
vehicle
to
get
the
deadly
tnt
charges
into
the
side
of
an
enemy
ship
it
was
almost
the
largest
of
the
rooms
they
had
seen
perhaps
seeming
so
because
of
the
additional
clear
space
in
the
middle
there
had
to
be
plenty
of
room
to
swing
the
big
torpedoes
into
position
before
their
tubes
first
march
and
stan
saw
the
two
racks
of
torpedoes
along
the
walls
the
long
cylinders
inches
in
diameter
and
about
twenty
feet
from
end
to
end
looked
deadly
march
noted
the
chain
hoist
by
which
they
could
be
swung
from
their
racks
into
position
for
loading
into
the
tubes
the
were
four
of
back
into
the
room
a
little
way
and
march
and
stan
knew
they
were
about
feet
long
altogether
their
openings
at
each
side
just
back
of
the
bow
of
the
boat
the
doors
closed
the
tubes
and
the
sub
was
ready
to
fire
its
charges
at
any
moment
it
must
take
a
terrific
blast
of
air
to
start
these
babies
on
their
way
stan
said
running
his
hand
along
one
of
the
big
torpedoes
yes
it
does
sutherland
replied
but
the
air
doesn
t
have
to
move
it
far
it
just
expels
it
from
the
tube
where
there
are
trigger
catches
which
trip
switches
here
on
the
torpedo
to
set
its
own
machinery
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
aren
t
they
march
mused
yes
they
re
really
little
submarines
with
an
explosive
charge
instead
of
a
crew
the
executive
officer
agreed
and
the
tnt
takes
up
only
a
small
space
really
half
the
length
is
compressed
air
to
drive
the
torp
it
s
got
to
move
pretty
fast
you
know
to
get
to
the
target
accurately
there
s
about
four
hundred
horsepower
packed
into
that
little
fellow
compressed
air
heated
by
an
alcohol
flame
blowing
like
fury
against
two
trim
little
turbines
turning
the
the
aiming
devices
must
be
very
accurate
stan
said
wonderful
sutherland
exclaimed
you
probably
know
there
s
a
little
whirling
gyroscope
that
keeps
the
torp
on
the
course
which
can
be
set
by
the
operator
in
advance
of
firing
then
there
s
the
compensating
chamber
and
pendulum
to
keep
it
at
its
proper
depth
it
can
t
very
well
get
off
but
don
t
you
have
to
aim
chiefly
with
the
sub
itself
sir
march
asked
i
t
the
sub
have
to
be
aimed
right
at
the
target
for
the
torpedo
to
get
there
not
at
all
sutherland
replied
the
sub
doesn
t
have
to
be
any
closer
than
sixty
degrees
in
facing
its
target
you
set
the
proper
course
on
the
torpedo
itself
and
the
automatic
devices
put
it
on
that
course
right
keep
it
there
then
the
important
thing
stan
said
is
for
the
skipper
to
get
the
course
right
not
necessarily
to
line
up
the
sub
with
his
that
s
right
the
older
officer
agreed
the
skipper
must
determine
the
course
to
his
target
and
call
it
out
if
he
s
good
he
gets
his
with
a
last
look
around
the
torpedo
room
they
turned
to
go
back
to
the
control
room
later
sutherland
said
to
them
as
they
stepped
through
the
bulkhead
door
you
ll
have
target
practice
with
special
torpedoes
that
don
t
blow
up
what
you
re
aiming
at
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
won
t
be
anything
you
can
t
do
by
the
time
we
get
through
with
illustration
inspected
the
torpedo
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
weeks
march
remembered
that
statement
often
he
went
on
countless
trips
in
the
training
subs
until
he
felt
as
much
at
home
in
them
as
he
did
in
his
own
quarters
for
the
first
few
times
he
observed
then
he
took
over
one
position
after
another
and
executed
its
duties
stan
was
with
him
on
all
these
trips
but
often
they
were
at
different
ends
of
the
boats
during
their
short
journeys
one
day
march
would
take
his
position
at
the
steering
wheel
the
next
he
would
handle
the
big
levers
controlling
the
kingston
valves
on
the
main
ballast
tanks
then
he
would
work
with
the
men
in
the
engine
room
after
having
studied
diesels
in
some
of
his
classes
he
did
a
stretch
in
the
torpedo
room
several
times
when
they
shot
the
practice
torps
at
special
targets
towed
by
a
surface
boat
he
worked
the
interphone
system
as
orderly
took
over
the
little
radio
shack
spent
several
hours
in
the
battery
room
working
the
diving
planes
i
ve
done
everything
so
far
but
cook
lunch
and
cut
the
crew
s
hair
he
said
to
stan
one
day
as
they
relaxed
wearily
for
fifteen
minutes
after
dinner
before
going
to
their
studies
same
here
stan
said
but
i
haven
t
been
assistant
pharmacist
oh
that
s
right
march
recalled
i
haven
t
passed
out
any
pills
yet
and
i
don
t
think
i
ll
have
do
you
feel
that
you
know
the
crew
s
jobs
pretty
well
now
march
stan
asked
most
of
them
march
replied
i
know
i
could
take
over
most
of
them
without
any
trouble
but
i
d
like
another
trip
or
two
in
the
torpedo
room
and
i
want
to
be
at
the
diving
controls
for
a
crash
dive
before
i
ll
feel
sure
of
i
agree
with
you
on
the
diving
controls
stan
said
but
i
feel
okay
on
the
torps
now
what
i
want
is
a
little
time
on
the
you
can
never
have
too
much
time
on
those
march
said
every
additional
hour
of
experience
with
them
makes
you
all
the
better
i
think
but
it
s
wonderful
that
they
teach
every
officer
to
do
every
job
on
the
just
the
work
of
the
other
officers
but
of
every
enlisted
man
on
not
only
did
they
handle
every
job
of
the
crew
on
the
sub
but
they
spent
hours
every
day
in
classroom
and
laboratory
they
studied
engines
and
motors
and
navigation
and
torpedoes
all
of
approach
and
attack
in
addition
to
their
work
on
the
training
subs
themselves
they
carried
out
attack
problems
in
the
wonderful
control
room
in
one
of
the
buildings
here
was
a
real
control
room
with
controls
and
periscopes
complete
standing
in
position
at
the
scope
as
if
he
were
the
skipper
of
the
ship
march
sighted
about
on
the
artificial
horizon
which
looked
quite
real
to
him
suddenly
he
saw
what
seemed
to
be
two
ships
appear
on
the
horizon
first
he
had
to
identify
them
then
he
had
to
judge
their
speed
and
course
accurately
while
they
still
looked
like
only
tiny
spots
in
his
periscopes
calling
out
orders
he
directed
the
course
of
the
submarine
he
was
commanding
so
that
he
would
be
in
position
to
fire
torpedoes
then
the
scope
went
down
as
would
happen
in
actual
combat
his
sub
was
traveling
under
water
without
even
the
revealing
to
show
the
enemy
where
he
was
then
he
surfaced
again
looked
through
the
scope
to
see
if
he
and
the
enemy
ships
were
where
they
ought
to
be
in
relation
to
each
other
if
he
was
right
he
ordered
the
setting
of
the
torpedo
courses
and
then
called
fire
one
fire
two
then
he
would
go
over
his
record
with
the
instructors
he
would
find
out
just
how
well
he
had
done
in
handling
the
complete
tactical
problem
that
had
been
presented
to
him
had
he
identified
the
ships
correctly
as
to
nationality
type
size
had
he
judged
their
speed
and
course
correctly
and
his
torpedoes
hit
home
if
he
had
handled
the
problem
correctly
he
felt
almost
the
thrill
that
might
have
come
with
sinking
an
actual
enemy
ship
several
afternoons
a
week
march
went
out
on
the
training
subs
he
asked
for
more
time
at
the
diving
controls
and
got
it
he
asked
for
two
watches
and
his
request
was
fulfilled
then
he
began
to
take
over
the
duties
of
the
various
officers
he
served
as
communications
officer
engineering
officer
electrical
officer
navigation
finally
as
diving
officer
the
first
time
he
gave
the
orders
to
take
the
ship
down
his
heart
was
in
his
throat
even
though
sutherland
was
standing
by
his
side
to
take
over
at
the
slightest
mistake
he
didn
t
believe
that
he
could
possibly
remember
all
the
things
he
had
to
but
he
found
as
the
orders
started
coming
from
his
mouth
that
his
mind
ordered
them
out
without
his
thinking
about
them
he
knew
so
well
by
this
time
the
logical
order
of
events
that
his
mind
went
straight
along
that
path
without
a
hitch
what
pleased
march
most
of
all
after
this
more
than
the
pleasant
commendation
of
the
executive
the
word
spoken
to
him
by
scott
the
radioman
scott
had
been
on
the
training
subs
during
most
of
march
s
trips
too
and
they
had
spoken
to
each
other
frequently
but
on
the
dock
after
march
s
turn
as
diving
officer
scott
saluted
and
nodded
with
a
smile
if
you
ll
pardon
me
sir
he
said
i
d
like
to
mention
that
you
handled
that
diving
like
a
thanks
s
swell
of
you
to
say
that
march
mumbled
you
bunch
of
students
is
likely
to
get
a
little
funny
feeling
when
we
know
a
new
officer
s
goin
to
take
us
down
scott
said
but
we
couldn
t
have
been
safer
with
the
skipper
himself
than
we
were
with
march
wrote
about
that
in
the
letter
he
wrote
to
scoot
bailey
that
evening
he
had
been
so
busy
working
hard
sixteen
hours
a
day
that
scoot
seemed
miles
and
years
away
i
m
beginning
to
feel
like
a
real
submariner
at
last
scoot
he
wrote
for
a
while
i
thought
there
was
so
much
to
learn
that
i
d
never
get
there
but
i
m
at
home
now
and
i
think
i
can
make
it
all
right
i
suppose
you
ve
been
feeling
much
the
same
the
fact
that
flying
is
so
much
simpler
than
that
you
re
getting
the
feeling
of
being
a
pilot
without
having
an
instructor
in
your
lap
every
chapter
seven
orders
to
report
scoot
bailey
read
march
s
letter
and
grinned
so
flying
s
easy
he
says
he
muttered
to
himself
he
should
have
been
here
going
through
what
i
ve
been
through
aerodynamics
engines
controls
meteorology
gunnery
navigation
bombing
spot
landings
he
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
the
row
of
textbooks
on
the
desk
before
him
he
s
right
though
he
said
i
do
begin
to
feel
like
a
flier
at
first
before
i
d
ever
been
up
in
a
plane
i
thought
i
was
of
those
natural
fliers
only
there
isn
t
any
such
thing
then
when
i
first
flew
i
realized
i
didn
t
know
much
of
anything
next
when
i
got
so
i
could
handle
the
trainer
pretty
well
with
the
instructor
right
there
i
decided
flying
was
pretty
simple
after
he
sat
back
and
recalled
the
day
that
had
changed
his
mind
about
that
but
when
he
finally
told
me
to
take
it
up
oh
boy
there
i
sat
in
that
flying
machine
with
no
teacher
there
to
hold
my
hand
that
s
when
i
thought
i
didn
t
even
know
what
direction
the
stick
moved
i
didn
t
know
which
way
to
push
the
throttle
what
ever
gave
me
the
nerve
to
give
her
the
gun
and
take
off
i
can
never
figure
out
but
when
that
was
over
and
i
was
still
alive
and
in
one
piece
i
d
got
over
the
worst
of
he
realized
that
a
submariner
had
no
equivalent
of
soloing
in
a
plane
to
go
through
he
d
have
to
remember
to
write
that
to
march
after
that
i
straightened
myself
out
scoot
s
thoughts
went
on
i
wasn
t
too
cocky
and
i
wasn
t
too
scared
i
just
knew
that
i
had
learned
to
fly
a
little
bit
that
there
was
still
a
tremendous
amount
to
learn
and
that
if
i
worked
hard
enough
i
could
learn
it
and
turn
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
scoot
was
on
the
advanced
navy
trainer
now
a
fast
ship
that
came
closer
in
speed
and
maneuverability
to
the
fighters
he
would
eventually
fly
in
another
week
i
ll
be
heading
for
the
training
carrier
he
said
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
i
ll
get
my
wings
and
i
ll
be
a
real
navy
pilot
but
i
ve
still
got
a
lot
to
learn
taking
off
from
those
heaving
landing
on
em
going
to
be
quite
different
from
the
same
moves
on
these
nice
flat
texas
as
scoot
thought
about
it
about
the
work
march
had
been
doing
he
realized
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
common
in
their
fields
flying
a
plane
wasn
t
much
like
handling
a
submarine
but
both
of
them
got
away
from
the
normal
positions
of
most
people
the
flier
got
away
from
the
earth
s
surface
in
one
direction
the
submariner
got
away
from
it
by
going
under
they
both
handled
craft
that
could
travel
in
a
sphere
not
just
over
the
surface
like
a
tank
or
a
battleship
march
practices
coming
up
with
a
momsen
lung
scoot
told
himself
while
i
practice
coming
down
with
a
parachute
that
lung
s
just
a
sort
of
underwater
a
plane
was
just
a
vehicle
to
get
explosives
into
position
for
firing
at
the
enemy
and
so
was
a
submarine
scoot
concluded
and
sometimes
they
even
handled
the
same
now
if
someone
would
just
invent
a
flying
submarine
scoot
thought
march
and
i
could
get
together
again
but
i
guess
that
s
not
very
likely
outside
the
comic
strips
when
you
think
of
the
terrific
water
pressure
a
sub
has
to
stand
you
can
t
very
well
imagine
hooking
wings
on
to
something
that
heavily
plated
with
steel
and
think
of
the
batteries
m
afraid
march
and
i
will
be
separated
for
some
time
it
seems
a
shame
though
sub
and
plane
ought
to
make
a
mighty
fine
the
next
week
as
scoot
started
off
from
corpus
christi
for
the
training
carrier
off
the
shores
of
florida
march
was
setting
off
on
one
of
the
most
important
underwater
trips
of
his
training
it
was
a
trip
of
two
days
on
which
march
was
to
act
throughout
as
navigation
officer
still
his
specialty
despite
his
training
in
every
other
job
on
the
ship
march
knew
his
navigation
thoroughly
while
he
was
still
on
surface
ships
but
with
the
intensive
extra
study
he
had
gone
through
at
new
london
especially
on
dead
reckoning
and
blind
navigation
for
underwater
travel
he
was
a
master
during
the
trip
on
which
stan
bigelow
also
acted
as
engineering
officer
in
charge
of
the
diesels
and
motors
they
got
the
real
feeling
of
being
on
patrol
they
simulated
traveling
through
enemy
waters
and
so
ran
submerged
most
of
the
daylight
hours
the
skipper
taking
a
look
around
occasionally
with
the
periscope
numerous
drills
were
also
rehearsed
during
the
drills
drills
crash
dives
they
simulated
a
chlorine
gas
danger
acting
as
if
the
sea
water
had
got
into
the
batteries
to
give
off
the
deadly
fumes
gas
masks
were
out
in
a
hurry
and
the
battery
room
was
sealed
off
with
only
two
the
only
thing
we
haven
t
tried
on
this
trip
march
said
at
mess
the
first
evening
is
some
of
the
first
aid
we
ve
well
if
someone
will
volunteer
to
simulate
appendicitis
the
skipper
laughed
i
m
sure
pills
will
try
an
operation
but
you
forgot
something
else
we
haven
t
i
d
just
as
soon
skip
that
sir
stan
said
at
least
until
the
real
thing
hits
no
way
of
simulating
it
anyway
the
captain
commented
but
it
s
about
the
only
thing
we
leave
out
in
this
there
s
one
big
difference
march
said
in
training
if
you
make
a
mistake
why
you
just
get
a
bad
mark
from
the
teacher
in
real
submarining
in
war
time
you
re
likely
to
and
carry
a
lot
of
others
along
with
what
do
you
mean
the
skipper
asked
that
s
true
at
the
beginning
of
course
but
not
now
you
re
really
navigating
this
boat
anson
nobody
else
is
doing
it
and
nobody
s
checking
up
on
you
if
you
do
it
wrong
we
ll
pile
up
on
montauk
point
march
gulped
and
stan
looked
a
little
worried
what
s
the
matter
stan
march
asked
are
you
scared
think
i
m
not
a
good
enough
navigator
no
i
was
just
wondering
stan
said
if
the
same
thing
applied
to
i
m
really
totally
responsible
for
all
these
engines
on
this
of
course
you
are
bigelow
the
skipper
smiled
and
i
m
sure
you
ll
handle
them
very
nicely
just
as
i
m
confident
anson
will
take
us
just
where
we
re
supposed
to
go
you
are
not
allowed
to
take
over
these
duties
until
you
have
proved
conclusively
in
your
previous
work
that
you
could
do
as
darkness
descended
over
the
waters
of
long
island
sound
the
training
sub
surfaced
and
found
herself
just
where
she
was
supposed
to
be
at
that
time
much
to
march
s
relief
hiding
behind
a
point
of
land
near
the
end
of
long
island
they
charged
their
batteries
while
a
skeleton
crew
stayed
on
watch
most
of
the
others
went
to
bed
for
a
few
hours
sleep
in
the
bunks
which
lined
the
walls
of
most
of
the
rooms
march
and
stan
shared
a
tiny
cabin
but
were
not
in
it
at
the
same
time
as
their
watches
followed
one
another
before
dawn
the
next
morning
the
sub
set
off
from
its
cove
submerged
and
followed
the
next
course
under
water
sending
up
the
periscope
at
about
ten
o
clock
the
skipper
saw
the
target
boats
at
the
designated
spot
and
the
sub
went
through
a
series
of
simulated
attacks
on
enemy
shipping
crash
diving
to
get
away
from
destroyers
attacking
them
lying
on
the
bottom
with
all
motors
shut
off
for
a
spell
then
sneaking
away
at
a
depth
of
two
hundred
feet
in
a
circuitous
course
to
outwit
the
enemy
waiting
for
them
during
all
the
trip
the
skipper
and
lieutenant
commander
sutherland
were
closely
observing
without
seeming
to
do
so
the
actions
of
march
and
stan
and
of
the
student
diving
section
which
had
shipped
with
them
for
this
special
trip
they
were
interested
in
seeing
not
just
whether
the
men
could
handle
their
jobs
but
they
did
calmly
or
with
too
much
tension
on
occasion
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
senior
officers
would
give
a
conflicting
order
or
misunderstand
something
reported
by
stan
or
march
just
to
see
what
happened
not
once
did
stan
or
march
become
upset
and
the
two
older
men
smiled
at
each
other
meaningly
illustration
sub
set
off
and
two
good
officers
the
skipper
said
i
wish
i
could
get
out
on
patrol
again
and
take
along
a
couple
of
new
young
men
like
i
d
go
anywhere
with
them
myself
said
sutherland
why
do
we
have
to
be
so
old
skipper
didn
t
you
have
enough
action
in
the
last
war
the
captain
asked
no
sir
and
neither
did
you
well
men
like
anson
and
bigelow
will
have
to
do
it
for
us
this
time
i
guess
the
captain
said
and
i
suppose
we
re
doing
an
important
job
if
we
help
at
all
to
make
them
such
good
pigboat
they
re
ready
to
be
assigned
now
don
t
you
think
sutherland
asked
yes
without
a
doubt
they
can
t
learn
any
more
except
through
actual
experience
they
might
as
well
start
getting
it
right
march
and
stan
felt
sure
that
their
training
was
coming
to
an
end
so
far
as
classes
were
concerned
they
knew
that
they
had
covered
just
about
all
the
work
that
the
school
had
to
give
them
they
had
studied
so
hard
that
they
felt
mentally
exhausted
i
don
t
think
i
could
cram
one
more
fact
into
my
head
stan
said
it
s
going
to
take
some
time
for
the
facts
i
ve
been
putting
in
there
to
assemble
themselves
and
settle
down
in
some
orderly
we
ll
be
leaving
before
long
march
said
but
there
s
one
thing
i
want
to
do
before
i
leave
i
want
to
see
winnie
and
the
escape
tower
stan
exclaimed
of
ve
never
made
the
we
don
t
have
to
but
just
about
everybody
does
march
said
want
to
do
it
with
me
tomorrow
sure
if
there
s
a
group
going
through
stan
agreed
by
the
way
what
happened
to
that
fellow
cobden
who
flubbed
the
escape
he
made
it
march
said
and
he
s
already
done
the
too
the
psychiatrist
found
out
what
was
bothering
him
when
he
was
just
a
kid
he
was
swimming
with
a
gang
and
one
of
em
ducked
him
and
held
his
head
under
water
a
bit
too
long
he
got
some
water
in
his
lungs
passed
out
but
they
revived
him
he
d
forgotten
all
about
it
underneath
of
course
he
said
that
later
when
he
made
up
his
mind
to
learn
how
to
swim
well
it
took
a
lot
of
grit
to
make
himself
do
it
he
didn
t
know
why
it
bothered
him
but
he
had
the
guts
to
fight
it
out
and
really
learn
how
to
swim
never
did
any
diving
t
like
being
completely
under
and
after
all
these
years
that
old
experience
pops
up
stan
exclaimed
it
just
goes
to
prove
that
all
these
tests
are
so
sensible
march
said
what
if
he
hadn
t
found
that
out
until
he
got
in
a
sub
on
duty
somewhere
his
going
to
pieces
then
might
have
wrecked
it
or
caused
plenty
of
he
s
all
over
it
now
stan
asked
sure
march
said
as
soon
as
the
doc
got
the
story
out
of
him
and
explained
it
cobden
just
laughed
and
said
he
felt
foolish
went
right
over
to
the
level
and
did
the
escape
he
even
joked
with
the
chief
and
said
that
he
shouldn
t
hold
his
head
under
might
make
a
neurotic
out
of
that
s
swell
stan
commented
yes
and
he
insisted
on
taking
the
escape
right
away
too
march
went
on
but
they
were
smart
they
wouldn
t
let
him
they
thought
he
might
be
acting
under
a
temporary
fit
of
courage
and
bravado
and
the
old
fear
might
come
back
on
him
later
so
they
made
him
wait
a
couple
of
weeks
it
went
fine
before
going
to
the
escape
tower
the
next
day
march
looked
up
scott
the
radioman
and
reminded
him
of
their
date
to
look
at
winnie
and
minnie
together
so
scott
and
march
and
stan
went
to
the
tower
together
that
afternoon
donned
their
swimming
trunks
their
momsen
lungs
and
stepped
under
the
metal
skirt
in
the
water
at
the
bottom
as
march
started
up
the
long
cable
leading
to
the
surface
he
realized
that
the
hatch
and
platform
there
were
made
exactly
like
the
top
of
a
real
sub
and
there
on
the
walls
were
the
two
beautiful
mermaids
winnie
and
minnie
smiling
at
him
he
could
not
smile
back
because
of
the
momsen
lung
mouthpiece
but
he
waved
at
the
girls
and
went
slowly
up
past
them
at
the
platform
an
instructor
swam
out
and
around
him
waving
his
arms
to
indicate
that
march
was
moving
up
at
the
correct
speed
as
he
broke
the
surface
he
felt
fine
as
if
one
of
the
last
acts
at
new
london
had
been
accomplished
stan
and
scott
followed
him
quickly
and
then
the
three
of
them
were
presented
with
the
special
diplomas
decorated
with
pictures
of
winnie
and
minnie
stating
that
they
had
made
the
escape
as
march
and
stan
walked
back
to
their
quarters
march
said
now
i
feel
ready
for
anything
and
waiting
for
him
were
his
report
in
two
weeks
to
baltimore
maryland
for
duty
aboard
the
new
submarine
chapter
eight
stan
exclaimed
holding
in
his
hands
the
orders
which
directed
him
to
the
same
ship
what
kind
of
fish
is
that
never
heard
of
it
march
said
they
re
building
so
many
subs
these
days
that
they
re
running
out
of
fish
to
name
them
after
let
s
ask
the
exec
tonight
at
captain
sampson
knew
about
the
kamongo
a
very
important
creature
he
said
if
there
hadn
t
been
a
kamongo
we
probably
wouldn
t
be
here
what
do
you
mean
sir
stan
asked
wondering
at
the
officer
s
smile
and
twinkling
eyes
well
the
story
has
to
go
very
far
back
in
history
the
captain
said
back
when
the
earth
was
mostly
covered
with
water
and
the
only
living
creatures
were
the
water
there
had
to
be
something
that
crawled
out
of
the
water
and
learned
how
to
live
on
land
that
was
how
did
he
do
it
march
asked
did
he
have
lungs
maybe
a
momsen
lung
stan
suggested
with
a
laugh
not
captain
sampson
smiled
we
don
t
know
that
it
was
kamongo
itself
that
did
the
crawling
out
but
it
must
have
been
something
like
him
you
see
another
name
for
kamongo
is
lungfish
he
s
a
kind
of
fish
than
anything
else
in
many
he
s
also
got
lungs
of
a
sort
he
can
live
under
water
or
above
it
and
so
can
a
submarine
i
think
it
s
a
fine
name
for
a
sub
i
d
like
to
be
boarding
her
with
muttered
stan
almost
to
himself
yes
i
ve
been
thinking
the
same
thing
march
said
getting
used
to
our
ship
s
name
it
s
like
suddenly
finding
out
you
ve
got
a
wife
and
somebody
tells
you
her
you
ve
never
heard
it
if
you
say
it
over
more
and
more
stan
said
you
get
to
like
it
it
s
got
a
good
yes
i
think
so
march
agreed
it
s
got
strength
and
for
some
reason
it
sounds
sleek
and
trim
and
being
able
to
live
above
or
below
the
s
our
ship
all
right
two
weeks
stan
mused
you
re
going
home
i
suppose
yes
i
m
going
home
march
replied
it
may
be
the
last
time
for
quite
a
i
m
going
too
stan
said
good
old
utica
new
york
i
m
glad
it
isn
t
so
stan
and
march
said
goodbye
the
next
day
as
they
said
goodbye
to
all
the
others
they
had
come
to
know
so
well
at
new
london
but
to
each
other
they
were
able
to
say
see
you
in
a
couple
of
then
march
went
home
and
saw
his
mother
and
scoot
s
family
and
many
of
his
old
friends
but
hampton
did
not
seem
right
without
scoot
himself
it
had
been
a
wrench
when
he
went
off
to
new
london
without
him
but
there
he
had
been
so
busy
so
absorbed
that
he
had
hardly
had
time
to
miss
his
friend
of
so
many
years
now
back
in
the
town
they
had
grown
up
in
together
the
town
wasn
t
all
there
without
scoot
march
had
written
scoot
a
note
before
leaving
new
london
telling
him
that
he
was
going
home
on
leave
before
reporting
for
duty
and
scoot
had
gnashed
his
teeth
on
getting
the
letter
realizing
that
march
had
finished
his
training
first
scoot
felt
that
he
was
finished
too
for
he
had
done
everything
but
fly
down
the
funnel
of
the
training
what
s
left
for
me
to
learn
he
asked
unless
they
set
up
some
real
jap
zeros
here
for
me
to
shoot
at
i
don
t
see
what
else
i
can
then
just
four
days
before
march
had
to
leave
hampton
scoot
got
his
own
report
in
three
weeks
time
to
the
new
aircraft
carrier
at
san
francisco
he
raced
home
from
florida
as
fast
as
he
could
go
and
he
and
march
had
two
days
together
before
march
left
they
talked
submarines
and
airplanes
all
day
and
all
night
and
scoot
s
family
had
to
wait
until
march
left
before
they
had
a
really
good
chance
to
visit
with
him
but
march
felt
better
when
he
got
on
the
train
for
baltimore
it
was
good
to
have
seen
scoot
for
even
that
short
time
there
were
a
million
other
things
they
could
have
talked
about
but
they
had
got
close
to
one
another
again
in
that
time
and
they
had
gained
greater
spirit
from
their
companionship
he
tried
not
to
think
that
he
might
not
see
scoot
but
he
couldn
t
help
facing
it
after
all
he
told
himself
submarine
duty
is
no
bed
of
roses
people
do
get
killed
in
it
and
flying
a
navy
fighter
against
the
japs
is
not
the
safest
occupation
in
the
world
there
are
lots
of
young
fellows
going
out
on
such
jobs
who
won
t
be
coming
back
from
them
how
do
i
know
but
what
scoot
and
one
of
us
among
them
but
such
thoughts
did
not
stay
with
him
long
no
matter
what
the
facts
of
the
matter
or
the
statistics
of
casualties
in
wartime
march
felt
very
confident
of
returning
home
safe
and
sound
and
going
on
to
live
to
be
at
least
as
the
train
rolled
along
ever
nearer
to
baltimore
he
thought
more
and
more
of
his
new
home
his
new
ship
on
which
he
was
to
be
the
navigation
officer
she
s
probably
about
tons
he
said
like
most
of
them
they
re
building
now
trim
and
neat
about
three
hundred
and
some
odd
feet
long
she
ll
have
one
deck
gun
and
a
couple
of
antiaircraft
machine
guns
eight
or
ten
torpedo
and
he
tried
to
picture
in
his
mind
so
much
more
modern
and
powerful
than
the
old
on
which
he
had
been
training
he
mused
all
the
new
ones
are
i
m
lucky
to
get
on
a
ship
freshwater
showers
plenty
of
refrigeration
for
carrying
good
food
why
we
ll
probably
come
up
with
turkey
on
christmas
day
he
pictured
his
life
in
the
submarine
his
meals
his
quarters
i
may
have
a
little
cabin
of
my
much
more
than
a
telephone
booth
but
all
mine
maybe
not
of
course
but
these
new
ones
really
make
you
comfortable
probably
five
officers
aboard
crew
of
about
or
he
wondered
where
they
would
go
where
they
would
hunt
out
the
enemy
ships
reporting
on
the
atlantic
doesn
t
mean
anything
he
said
that
s
just
where
she
ll
take
the
water
after
her
trials
we
may
take
her
anywhere
for
action
now
scoot
knows
he
ll
be
serving
in
the
pacific
he
wouldn
t
be
going
to
san
francisco
otherwise
of
course
most
subs
are
in
the
pacific
now
too
but
there
are
plenty
operating
in
the
atlantic
can
t
tell
where
we
ll
go
but
we
ll
have
a
cruising
range
of
about
fifteen
thousand
miles
we
can
go
just
about
anywhere
we
and
then
he
thought
of
stan
he
liked
the
young
ensign
with
whom
he
had
gone
through
school
at
new
london
he
didn
t
of
course
feel
as
close
to
him
as
he
did
to
scoot
there
wasn
t
the
same
warmth
between
them
but
the
redhead
was
a
real
man
intelligent
human
and
a
good
friend
i
ll
be
darned
glad
to
get
on
that
boat
and
find
one
familiar
face
march
told
himself
i
wonder
what
the
skipper
s
he
began
to
think
more
and
more
of
this
after
he
got
off
the
train
and
headed
for
the
navy
yard
if
the
skipper
happened
to
be
an
contemptuous
of
youngsters
or
a
gruff
sort
without
any
heart
in
it
might
not
be
so
good
as
he
approached
the
gate
and
prepared
to
show
the
sentry
his
pass
he
saw
someone
ahead
of
him
that
looked
familiar
stan
he
called
still
not
sure
that
it
really
was
bigelow
and
then
as
the
man
turned
he
was
sure
he
had
been
wrong
for
the
man
wore
the
stripes
of
a
lieutenant
and
bigelow
was
only
an
ensign
but
the
man
called
back
march
and
march
knew
his
first
guess
had
been
right
it
stan
bigelow
stan
he
cried
pumping
his
hand
vigorously
i
thought
i
was
wrong
they
ve
finally
found
out
how
good
you
are
and
made
you
a
lieutenant
sure
stan
cried
the
only
thing
that
bothered
me
was
that
i
ought
to
have
been
made
an
admiral
it
all
happened
during
my
leave
i
was
sure
sick
of
being
an
ensign
do
you
remember
how
the
cpo
s
look
down
on
an
ensign
i
surely
do
march
said
showing
his
papers
to
the
sentry
but
they
don
t
think
junior
lieutenants
are
so
wonderful
either
as
you
ll
soon
find
but
i
think
chief
petty
officers
are
wonderful
stan
said
they
know
more
than
half
the
rear
admirals
in
the
they
were
walking
along
the
path
together
between
long
low
buildings
for
a
few
minutes
they
said
nothing
gee
i
m
glad
i
ran
into
you
stan
said
i
was
just
thinking
the
same
thing
march
said
with
enthusiasm
i
m
excited
as
the
devil
about
this
but
i
began
to
feel
the
need
of
a
friend
close
at
hand
i
wonder
what
the
skipper
will
be
are
you
reading
my
thoughts
stan
exclaimed
he
can
make
or
break
us
you
i
know
it
march
replied
why
on
this
first
cruise
the
commanding
officer
can
get
us
out
of
the
sub
service
just
by
saying
he
doesn
t
like
the
color
of
our
illustration
ve
made
you
a
lieutenant
well
we
re
going
to
find
out
pretty
soon
stan
said
that
looks
like
a
mighty
pretty
pigboat
alongside
that
dock
up
ahead
it
might
be
it
theirs
it
was
long
and
sleek
and
beautiful
in
the
dark
waters
that
lapped
her
sides
they
showed
the
necessary
papers
to
the
guard
at
the
gangplank
and
went
aboard
it
was
now
almost
completely
dark
everybody
s
down
below
march
said
skipper
may
not
even
be
there
stan
replied
the
sentry
overheard
them
the
skipper
s
below
sir
he
said
march
and
stan
walked
across
the
narrow
gangplank
climbed
the
conning
tower
ladder
and
then
slid
down
the
hatch
to
the
control
room
below
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
they
looked
around
blinking
first
of
all
march
saw
the
gleaming
shining
newness
of
everything
in
the
room
it
was
beautiful
then
his
eyes
focused
on
two
or
three
crewmen
who
looked
casually
at
him
then
on
a
young
man
about
his
age
who
looked
up
with
a
smile
he
saw
the
lieutenant
s
not
stripes
and
saluted
lieutenant
anson
sir
reporting
he
said
lieutenant
bigelow
stan
echoed
him
the
young
man
saluted
back
casually
hello
he
said
glad
to
know
you
my
name
s
march
smiled
he
liked
this
young
man
right
away
maybe
another
new
officer
we
d
like
to
report
to
the
skipper
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
you
ve
done
it
men
the
man
said
lightly
i
m
the
march
was
thunderstruck
this
young
fellow
the
skipper
why
he
didn
t
look
any
older
than
march
or
stan
and
march
knew
that
wasn
t
qualified
to
be
the
captain
of
a
submarine
but
he
quickly
abandoned
his
friendly
tone
and
grew
formal
sir
he
said
lieutenant
anson
so
you
said
the
skipper
replied
come
on
into
my
he
turned
and
led
the
way
through
the
small
bulkhead
door
to
a
narrow
hall
from
which
doors
led
to
very
small
cabins
in
the
first
of
these
he
turned
and
sat
down
behind
a
small
table
officers
mess
he
said
motioning
them
to
sit
down
cramped
but
beautiful
make
yourselves
at
stan
and
march
didn
t
know
what
to
say
they
liked
the
young
man
but
their
surprise
at
his
youth
bothered
them
he
seemed
to
sense
their
thoughts
and
smiled
don
t
be
upset
he
said
i
m
not
quite
as
young
and
inexperienced
as
i
look
graduated
from
annapolis
six
years
ago
been
in
submarines
ever
since
i
was
executive
officer
on
the
in
the
pacific
since
the
war
to
be
at
pearl
harbor
when
it
happened
on
my
last
patrol
lost
my
bless
he
had
a
heart
attack
had
to
take
over
transferred
to
this
new
baby
when
i
got
back
do
you
come
from
march
relaxed
and
smiled
he
liked
this
man
at
once
he
could
see
their
thoughts
their
surprise
and
he
could
put
them
at
their
ease
at
once
served
a
year
aboard
the
he
said
volunteered
for
submarine
duty
sent
to
new
london
just
completed
training
my
story
doesn
t
sound
so
good
stan
said
i
was
a
i
didn
t
like
it
diesels
mainly
they
finally
gave
in
because
i
pestered
them
so
much
and
sent
me
to
new
london
i
went
through
the
mill
there
with
lieutenant
we
might
as
well
get
this
name
business
out
of
the
way
gray
said
i
m
not
one
for
rushing
into
calling
everybody
by
his
first
name
right
off
but
on
the
other
hand
i
don
t
believe
in
keeping
up
the
formalities
on
a
submarine
my
name
s
larry
when
you
feel
you
know
me
well
enough
and
it
comes
easy
call
me
that
until
then
call
me
skipper
or
my
name
s
march
anson
march
said
it
must
have
been
bad
when
you
were
an
ensign
gray
said
a
lot
of
puns
about
ensign
anson
i
ll
march
grinned
plenty
he
replied
that
was
the
reason
i
liked
my
promotion
so
i
don
t
know
why
i
liked
it
stan
said
but
i
just
got
mine
and
i
m
mighty
happy
about
it
anyway
my
name
s
now
we
re
straight
on
that
gray
said
anson
you
re
the
navigation
officer
according
to
my
reports
and
bigelow
is
the
engineering
officer
there
are
two
others
you
ll
meet
them
a
little
later
in
the
evening
corvin
is
my
exec
he
was
with
me
on
the
he
s
the
diving
officer
too
mcfee
was
another
from
the
s
communications
and
handles
commissary
on
the
side
bigelow
you
may
not
know
but
you
ll
take
care
of
the
electrical
end
of
things
as
well
as
yes
sir
stan
said
hoping
inwardly
that
he
would
remember
all
he
had
learned
about
the
many
electrical
ends
of
the
submarine
electricity
s
everything
on
a
sub
well
not
quite
everything
gray
smiled
but
it
s
pretty
important
we
can
t
get
along
very
well
without
it
anyway
but
if
you
need
any
advice
or
just
plain
moral
support
get
next
to
mcfee
he
knows
electricity
backward
and
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
then
gray
showed
them
to
their
quarters
stan
and
march
shared
a
tiny
cabin
that
looked
like
a
palatial
mansion
to
them
at
once
because
they
loved
it
so
much
then
the
skipper
asked
if
they
had
eaten
dinner
before
they
came
aboard
they
had
not
good
gray
said
i
m
just
about
to
eat
we
ll
have
it
they
went
back
to
the
little
room
that
served
as
officers
mess
and
the
messboy
appeared
within
a
few
moments
they
were
eagerly
eating
rare
roast
beef
french
fried
potatoes
succotash
with
biscuits
and
hot
coffee
don
t
get
spoiled
by
the
biscuits
gray
said
we
eat
pretty
well
but
the
cook
doesn
t
have
time
for
such
frills
very
often
when
we
re
under
by
the
time
the
meal
was
over
march
and
stan
felt
completely
at
home
and
gray
seemed
very
much
at
ease
we
ll
go
over
the
ship
tomorrow
morning
he
said
she
s
a
beauty
nothing
finer
being
built
today
and
i
know
you
ll
love
know
about
her
name
by
the
way
yes
captain
sampson
told
us
about
it
when
we
got
our
orders
in
new
london
march
said
i
like
so
do
i
stan
said
i
felt
proud
telling
everybody
at
home
about
what
it
a
little
later
while
they
were
talking
corvin
and
mcfee
the
two
other
officers
came
in
together
introductions
were
informal
and
easy
and
march
began
to
feel
very
happy
these
two
men
were
just
as
young
as
their
skipper
march
felt
as
if
he
were
really
at
home
with
people
just
like
himself
he
turned
and
gave
a
look
at
stan
who
was
beaming
what
s
that
mean
gray
asked
who
seemed
to
notice
everything
think
you
ll
like
us
march
didn
t
know
what
to
say
it
s
hardly
up
to
us
to
he
began
oh
yes
it
s
very
important
gray
said
if
i
don
t
like
you
ll
go
if
you
don
t
like
ll
know
it
even
if
i
like
you
and
off
you
ll
go
he
laughed
you
see
we
ve
got
to
get
along
mcfee
spoke
up
i
think
we
will
they
talked
for
two
hours
more
before
going
to
bed
gray
told
them
that
the
rest
of
the
crew
would
report
the
next
morning
before
eight
and
that
they
d
get
under
way
by
noon
march
slept
the
sleep
of
the
good
and
the
happy
dreaming
only
of
navigating
right
into
the
japanese
emperor
s
back
yard
in
which
he
proceeded
to
sink
the
entire
japanese
imperial
navy
the
next
morning
the
officers
had
breakfast
together
except
for
corvin
who
had
stood
watch
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
so
was
sleeping
they
all
went
into
the
control
room
then
where
march
was
startled
to
see
a
familiar
face
scott
he
cried
yes
sir
cried
the
radioman
with
a
wide
smile
i
m
certainly
happy
to
see
sir
and
then
he
saw
stan
behind
march
and
you
too
bigelow
you
notice
things
pretty
quickly
don
t
you
scotty
stan
laughed
you
ve
got
to
sir
if
you
re
in
submarines
did
you
know
you
d
be
assigned
here
scott
march
asked
not
when
you
left
sir
scott
replied
and
then
i
didn
t
know
where
you
d
been
assigned
we
re
all
here
you
whole
diving
section
that
worked
together
at
new
and
sallini
and
all
of
wonderful
march
cried
why
i
feel
completely
at
home
already
so
do
i
sir
scott
said
gray
who
had
listened
to
the
exchange
of
conversations
spoke
up
the
navy
is
wonderful
he
said
they
really
do
things
right
you
d
think
nobody
higher
up
would
have
time
to
think
of
these
things
but
here
we
ve
got
of
a
crew
with
officers
that
ve
been
in
action
and
the
other
third
just
trained
all
know
each
other
officers
and
men
were
trained
together
why
we
re
really
going
to
get
as
they
went
through
the
ship
march
and
stan
said
hello
to
the
other
men
of
the
diving
section
from
new
london
and
there
were
mutual
congratulations
all
around
a
spirit
of
happiness
and
friendship
spread
through
the
boat
the
older
crew
members
most
of
whom
had
served
under
gray
before
caught
this
spirit
and
felt
that
all
this
was
a
good
sign
a
good
omen
for
a
new
ship
just
starting
out
on
her
shakedown
cruise
march
saw
gray
close
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
smile
very
slightly
he
suddenly
realized
the
skipper
s
great
responsibilities
he
knew
that
a
crew
that
got
along
was
essential
to
successful
submarine
work
and
it
had
happened
this
crew
was
going
to
click
and
gray
knew
it
he
was
duly
thankful
chapter
nine
all
during
the
morning
supplies
were
being
loaded
into
and
oil
and
water
and
torpedoes
larry
gray
spent
the
time
from
eleven
to
eleven
at
navy
headquarters
going
over
final
details
and
receiving
his
sealed
orders
when
he
returned
his
officers
reported
to
him
one
by
one
informing
him
that
their
departments
were
ready
he
looked
at
his
watch
fine
he
said
we
might
as
well
shove
off
come
on
he
stepped
from
his
quarters
into
the
control
room
with
corvin
his
executive
officer
behind
him
there
he
saw
march
at
the
little
navigation
desk
want
to
come
up
to
the
bridge
with
us
he
asked
we
re
getting
under
sure
thing
march
replied
i
might
as
well
wave
goodbye
to
land
we
may
not
see
any
for
some
oh
i
think
we
ll
be
seeing
land
for
a
while
gray
replied
starting
up
the
ladder
to
the
conning
tower
know
where
we
re
going
march
asked
no
but
i
ve
got
my
ideas
the
skipper
answered
ray
corvin
grinned
at
march
as
he
stepped
up
the
ladder
and
his
ideas
are
usually
right
he
muttered
on
the
bridge
march
looked
over
the
busy
waters
of
the
harbor
a
gray
mist
hung
over
everything
penetrating
sweaters
and
coats
in
a
chilling
wave
march
shivered
well
now
that
winter
s
coming
on
he
said
i
hope
you
re
leading
us
to
a
warmer
i
think
so
said
gray
as
his
eyes
swiftly
went
over
his
boat
the
dock
and
the
ships
in
the
harbor
but
you
never
can
tell
it
might
be
iceland
or
the
run
to
brrr
shivered
ray
corvin
don
t
mention
okay
ray
let
s
get
going
gray
said
and
corvin
began
to
bark
his
orders
for
casting
off
the
lines
march
knew
that
stan
bigelow
was
below
looking
over
his
shining
new
diesels
ready
for
the
moment
when
they
would
roar
into
action
after
all
the
training
he
had
gone
at
last
was
the
real
thing
he
had
to
make
those
diesels
run
and
run
right
at
all
times
this
was
a
shakedown
cruise
but
it
was
probably
combined
with
the
voyage
of
getting
to
some
battle
zone
march
and
stan
were
not
submarine
officers
quite
for
sure
this
first
assignment
was
their
last
test
if
they
did
a
good
job
and
pleased
the
skipper
they
d
be
set
if
d
be
out
the
electric
motors
whined
as
the
pigboat
slid
back
away
from
the
dock
into
open
water
then
came
the
roar
of
the
diesels
and
the
clouds
of
white
smoke
from
the
exhaust
vents
and
march
smiled
knowing
stan
s
pride
in
the
powerful
rumble
of
those
engines
in
a
few
minutes
the
boat
had
swung
around
and
headed
downstream
toward
chesapeake
bay
for
some
time
they
knew
they
would
be
traveling
between
two
long
shores
here
they
could
easily
go
on
the
surface
but
once
out
in
the
open
sea
they
would
have
to
travel
submerged
during
daylight
hours
it
had
surprised
march
when
he
first
learned
that
our
own
subs
traveled
submerged
in
our
own
waters
but
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
it
made
sense
there
were
german
subs
traveling
in
our
waters
too
and
there
was
a
constant
naval
and
aerial
patrol
looking
for
them
from
the
air
the
markings
on
a
pigboat
did
not
stand
out
very
well
particularly
if
a
rolling
sea
were
breaking
over
it
and
the
patrol
had
orders
to
shoot
first
and
ask
questions
later
a
german
sub
could
very
quickly
when
sighted
and
the
minute
or
two
taken
to
look
more
closely
or
to
ask
questions
might
result
in
its
escape
after
half
an
hour
larry
gray
went
below
leaving
march
and
ray
corvin
on
the
bridge
with
two
enlisted
men
one
serving
as
lookout
and
the
other
handling
the
controls
march
had
little
to
do
until
they
were
in
the
open
sea
for
navigating
down
the
bay
was
no
job
at
all
after
they
were
out
a
few
hours
the
skipper
would
open
his
sealed
orders
and
then
march
would
have
a
job
to
do
charting
the
sub
s
course
to
their
destination
he
and
corvin
talked
with
each
other
leaning
on
the
rail
and
watching
the
choppy
waters
slide
past
the
sleek
sides
of
ray
spoke
of
larry
gray
with
such
warmth
of
feeling
such
admiration
that
march
felt
sure
of
his
own
first
impression
of
the
skipper
here
was
a
man
he
would
like
and
would
grow
to
like
more
and
more
as
time
went
on
it
s
cold
corvin
said
why
don
t
you
go
below
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
nothing
going
on
guess
i
will
march
said
see
you
march
slid
down
the
ladder
to
the
control
room
and
started
over
to
the
officers
wardroom
then
he
saw
scotty
at
the
little
radio
shack
and
stopped
to
speak
with
him
how
do
you
feel
scotty
he
asked
it
s
good
to
get
going
isn
t
it
i
should
say
so
sir
scott
replied
know
where
we
re
going
not
yet
march
replied
skipper
opens
orders
ten
hours
well
wherever
we
re
going
scott
said
i
m
sure
glad
we
re
goin
with
you
sir
and
the
whole
gang
feels
the
same
way
you
see
we
sort
of
liked
the
way
you
handled
the
pigboats
back
there
in
new
thanks
scotty
march
said
and
you
don
t
know
how
good
it
made
me
feel
to
find
you
boys
here
bigelow
and
i
felt
right
at
home
from
then
march
turned
and
found
the
skipper
at
the
door
smiling
come
on
in
for
a
cup
of
coffee
gray
said
thanks
march
replied
sliding
down
behind
the
little
table
in
the
wardroom
with
gray
jimmy
just
brought
the
pot
of
coffee
gray
said
filling
march
s
cup
it
s
hot
jimmy
s
the
messboy
by
the
march
smiled
to
himself
jimmy
the
messboy
was
only
about
one
year
younger
than
gray
those
men
you
knew
in
new
london
gray
said
seem
to
like
we
got
to
know
each
other
pretty
well
march
said
we
went
through
the
whole
business
together
there
are
some
swell
men
among
what
about
sallini
the
pharmacist
larry
asked
of
the
best
march
said
he
s
quiet
and
reserved
but
with
a
nice
sense
of
humor
you
don
t
always
suspect
is
i
like
that
kind
gray
said
i
was
a
little
hesitant
about
having
a
new
pharmacist
on
board
it
can
be
a
mighty
important
job
if
there
s
serious
sickness
or
trouble
think
he
can
stand
the
gaff
i
think
he
d
get
better
the
more
difficult
the
situation
march
said
one
of
the
prizes
of
the
bunch
is
that
cobden
he
really
has
march
told
the
skipper
about
cobden
s
experience
with
the
escape
tower
and
his
overcoming
of
his
emotional
fears
illustration
skipper
was
at
the
that
s
swell
gray
commented
nothing
much
can
lick
anybody
after
that
with
our
chief
in
the
torpedo
room
kalinsky
the
man
ought
to
turn
into
a
real
submariner
pete
kalinsky
is
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
whole
navy
men
under
him
love
him
and
they
learn
plenty
march
looked
up
as
the
red
head
and
bulldog
face
of
stan
bigelow
appeared
he
sat
down
and
joined
them
in
a
cup
of
coffee
the
engineering
officer
was
smiling
broadly
did
you
ever
hear
anything
prettier
than
those
engines
he
demanded
philharmonic
is
pretty
good
march
laughed
and
i
think
i
prefer
bing
not
me
stan
exclaimed
that
purr
is
the
sweetest
sound
there
is
and
are
those
beauties
the
very
latest
thing
you
know
the
very
latest
i
personally
ordered
them
that
way
gray
smiled
and
i
m
glad
you
re
satisfied
i
never
liked
an
engineer
that
didn
t
have
a
deep
and
abiding
affection
for
his
after
talking
a
while
march
went
to
the
chartroom
and
went
through
the
detailed
maps
idly
picking
out
one
here
and
there
that
looked
interesting
to
him
look
at
this
wake
island
some
of
those
names
sound
wonderful
wonder
if
we
ll
hit
any
of
later
he
went
up
to
the
bridge
again
and
found
that
larry
gray
had
relieved
corvin
i
feel
sort
of
useless
he
said
nothing
to
do
nothing
much
for
any
of
us
to
do
right
now
gray
said
plain
sailing
like
this
isn
t
very
hard
most
of
the
crew
are
lying
down
reading
playing
checkers
or
just
shooting
the
breeze
why
don
t
you
have
a
little
rest
not
i
march
said
not
on
my
first
day
out
i
don
t
want
to
miss
anything
anyway
in
another
hour
we
ought
to
be
getting
away
from
land
a
bit
and
a
couple
of
hours
after
that
you
ll
be
opening
your
orders
i
want
to
know
where
we
re
going
just
as
soon
as
i
as
the
time
approached
for
opening
the
orders
there
was
an
air
of
tenseness
throughout
the
boat
the
crew
members
who
had
been
lying
down
weren
t
sleepy
or
tired
any
more
they
were
up
walking
back
and
forth
in
the
narrow
passageways
climbing
up
the
forward
hatch
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
climbing
down
again
to
get
another
cup
of
coffee
everyone
but
larry
gray
seemed
a
little
nervous
he
still
stood
calmly
on
the
bridge
looking
out
over
the
long
rollers
in
which
now
sailed
the
last
line
of
land
had
finally
disappeared
behind
them
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
then
slid
down
the
conning
tower
hatch
without
a
word
mcfee
and
corvin
and
march
anson
who
were
all
on
the
bridge
with
him
looked
at
each
other
this
is
really
my
watch
mcfee
said
go
on
down
you
two
but
for
gosh
sakes
let
me
know
as
soon
as
you
find
so
march
and
ray
corvin
went
below
and
sat
down
in
the
wardroom
they
knew
the
skipper
was
in
his
quarters
next
door
he
ll
be
calling
for
the
chart
in
a
minute
corvin
said
the
chart
of
where
we
re
going
then
we
ll
but
gray
did
not
call
for
a
chart
instead
he
sauntered
into
the
wardroom
sat
down
and
smiled
sorry
to
disappoint
you
he
said
i
feel
a
little
let
down
myself
though
it
s
a
perfectly
natural
not
iceland
corvin
cried
don
t
tell
me
that
gray
laughed
no
our
present
destination
is
just
a
well
if
it
s
so
disappointing
corvin
exploded
why
are
you
trying
to
build
it
up
into
something
dramatic
by
holding
out
on
us
i
think
it
s
just
a
gag
it
s
probably
that
we
re
going
to
blast
kiel
harbor
from
inside
or
find
some
way
of
traveling
up
the
sewers
to
ray
you
ve
been
going
to
too
many
movies
larry
said
you
know
that
life
on
a
submarine
is
very
prosaic
except
for
just
once
in
a
while
gentlemen
we
are
going
to
san
francisco
california
chapter
ten
through
the
canal
it
had
been
a
bad
anticlimax
everybody
in
the
crew
felt
badly
let
down
corvin
and
march
forgot
all
about
telling
mcfee
up
on
the
bridge
who
was
mentally
trying
to
decide
between
the
marshall
islands
and
the
black
sea
as
probable
destinations
finally
he
phoned
down
and
angrily
asked
why
someone
didn
t
let
the
bridge
know
where
they
were
supposed
to
be
going
how
do
you
expect
anybody
to
steer
the
ship
in
this
big
ocean
he
demanded
if
he
doesn
t
know
where
he
s
going
when
he
heard
the
words
san
francisco
he
groaned
what
s
the
matter
with
san
francisco
stan
asked
i
ve
always
wanted
to
see
francisco
s
wonderful
ray
corvin
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
live
not
far
from
there
and
maybe
i
ll
get
a
chance
to
see
my
family
for
a
day
or
two
so
i
m
very
happy
in
some
ways
it
s
just
that
we
got
so
keyed
up
expecting
to
head
right
into
a
pitched
i
m
not
too
surprised
gray
said
i
felt
sure
we
were
going
to
the
pacific
and
i
thought
we
might
go
direct
to
our
base
there
but
if
we
hit
frisco
on
the
s
only
natural
of
course
we
ll
get
more
orders
there
and
then
we
ll
surely
head
for
some
march
felt
just
as
well
about
the
news
he
would
have
a
chance
to
learn
everything
about
the
submarine
from
one
end
to
the
other
he
would
actually
navigate
the
ship
a
few
thousand
miles
but
without
having
to
worry
too
much
about
enemy
ships
or
mines
or
planes
while
doing
it
by
the
time
they
left
san
francisco
he
d
feel
like
a
veteran
submariner
he
would
be
able
to
handle
his
regular
tasks
without
thinking
about
them
and
he
d
be
able
to
take
actual
fighting
with
vigor
and
enthusiasm
during
the
daytime
they
ran
submerged
a
good
deal
of
the
time
taking
a
look
through
the
periscope
occasionally
once
the
skipper
saw
a
navy
blimp
right
above
them
and
they
headed
for
two
hundred
feet
depth
in
a
hurry
but
nothing
happened
at
night
they
ran
on
the
surface
and
they
were
lucky
enough
to
have
good
weather
most
of
the
time
with
plenty
of
stars
for
march
to
shoot
on
the
sextant
so
that
he
could
check
his
course
he
was
pleased
to
see
that
his
instrument
navigation
carried
out
when
they
were
submerged
was
checked
by
his
celestial
observations
there
came
a
day
that
was
cloudy
and
overcast
so
the
skipper
decided
to
travel
on
the
surface
there
won
t
be
any
planes
out
today
he
said
and
we
can
make
much
better
time
on
top
but
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
other
surface
craft
can
t
see
very
far
in
this
march
took
over
his
regular
watch
that
afternoon
on
the
bridge
he
had
on
a
heavy
sweater
and
waterproof
hood
and
jacket
for
the
moisture
in
the
air
even
if
it
were
not
rain
soaked
everything
inside
of
fifteen
minutes
two
crew
members
were
on
lookout
in
addition
to
the
man
at
the
controls
march
listened
to
their
regular
calls
of
all
clear
and
stared
ahead
into
the
blanket
of
fog
then
suddenly
he
saw
as
the
lookout
shouted
freighter
on
port
bow
march
shouted
the
alarming
news
into
the
interphone
ordered
the
man
at
the
controls
to
reverse
engines
and
put
her
over
hard
starboard
the
big
freighter
loomed
so
large
out
of
the
mist
that
march
knew
they
might
crash
the
freighter
had
just
sighted
them
and
hadn
t
even
slowed
down
so
without
another
thought
he
shouted
the
order
rig
for
crash
dive
the
klaxon
blared
through
the
boat
below
and
march
knew
that
men
were
leaping
to
their
posts
that
gray
was
struggling
out
from
his
bunk
or
from
behind
the
wardroom
table
would
he
come
up
to
the
bridge
march
knew
there
might
not
be
any
any
conning
the
time
he
could
get
there
no
matter
how
fast
he
moved
he
glanced
at
the
deck
hatches
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
saw
they
were
already
closed
for
the
rolling
seas
were
washing
over
the
decks
and
none
of
the
crew
men
had
wanted
to
come
up
for
fresh
air
on
a
day
like
this
in
a
few
seconds
only
the
word
came
back
to
him
boat
rigged
for
crash
dive
he
had
already
motioned
the
lookouts
down
into
the
hatch
and
the
control
man
was
securing
his
gear
on
the
bridge
take
her
down
he
ordered
as
the
control
man
slid
down
the
hatch
he
heard
the
bubbling
hiss
of
air
from
the
main
ballast
vents
the
roar
of
water
as
it
rushed
into
the
tanks
through
the
huge
kingston
valves
with
a
last
glance
he
saw
in
a
flash
many
details
on
the
freighter
most
of
all
he
saw
that
it
looked
tremendous
that
it
seemed
almost
on
top
of
him
although
he
realized
that
its
size
in
comparison
with
the
sub
made
it
look
closer
than
it
really
was
he
saw
officers
on
the
bridge
shouting
orders
and
men
rushing
to
man
a
gun
on
the
forward
deck
then
he
slipped
below
swung
the
hatch
shut
after
him
and
dogged
it
down
before
slipping
on
down
into
the
control
room
illustration
big
freighter
came
head
the
diesels
had
stopped
their
roar
and
the
electric
motors
were
whining
a
song
as
they
drove
the
boat
with
all
their
power
he
glanced
at
the
christmas
tree
and
smiled
to
see
nothing
but
green
lights
every
opening
every
vent
was
closed
and
the
boat
was
tight
the
inclinometer
showed
them
close
to
a
fifteen
degree
angle
of
dive
the
maximum
that
was
safe
before
the
acid
in
the
batteries
would
spill
out
only
then
did
he
notice
larry
gray
and
ray
corvin
and
mcfee
standing
motionless
tense
in
the
middle
of
the
control
room
they
were
listening
waiting
and
march
listened
and
waited
too
expecting
any
moment
the
rending
tearing
sound
of
a
steel
bow
crashing
through
their
superstructure
through
their
outer
hull
through
the
inner
pressure
then
the
deluge
as
the
ocean
poured
in
upon
them
one
seconds
passed
and
then
march
relaxed
all
right
now
he
said
she
d
have
hit
now
if
she
were
going
to
she
was
that
he
saw
a
few
of
the
men
relax
a
bit
and
begin
to
breathe
again
but
most
of
them
remained
silent
and
tense
they
did
not
share
his
confidence
or
have
confidence
in
his
judgment
he
glanced
at
the
depth
gauge
and
saw
it
at
feet
all
depended
on
how
much
water
that
freighter
was
drawing
maybe
it
would
still
knock
a
few
pieces
off
the
conning
tower
at
least
but
then
he
heard
the
soundman
say
propellers
passing
how
close
gray
asked
sharply
just
about
kissing
us
came
the
answer
but
passing
then
everyone
relax
the
crewmen
began
to
talk
a
bit
among
themselves
scotty
looked
at
march
and
grinned
wiping
a
hand
over
his
brow
as
if
to
brush
away
the
sweat
of
fear
and
then
clasped
both
hands
in
a
congratulatory
signal
march
just
nodded
nice
work
anson
gray
said
quietly
that
was
a
close
one
let
s
have
a
cup
of
coffee
you
probably
need
they
turned
toward
the
wardroom
together
and
march
felt
the
eyes
of
all
crewmen
on
him
steady
at
a
hundred
feet
the
skipper
ordered
before
leaving
the
control
room
and
keep
on
steady
at
one
hundred
came
back
the
order
yes
then
the
officers
went
into
the
wardroom
and
sat
down
just
as
stan
appeared
at
the
door
what
in
blazes
happened
he
asked
we
just
about
got
run
down
that
s
all
the
skipper
smiled
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
submarining
bigelow
your
friend
anson
here
took
us
down
in
a
big
were
on
the
bridge
march
stan
asked
yes
if
you
d
known
that
march
laughed
you
would
have
been
twice
as
scared
wouldn
t
you
wow
we
went
down
in
a
big
hurry
all
right
stan
said
did
you
have
miss
it
guess
so
march
said
anyway
they
were
unlimbering
a
gun
the
last
thing
i
saw
and
would
ve
been
shooting
at
us
if
we
d
still
been
in
yes
you
did
the
right
thing
all
right
gray
said
and
without
much
time
to
think
about
but
the
crew
was
marvelous
march
said
i
got
the
call
back
that
the
ship
was
rigged
almost
before
i
got
the
order
out
of
my
mouth
it
s
a
good
feeling
to
know
a
crew
can
act
like
that
isn
t
it
gray
especially
when
a
third
of
it
is
brand
yes
mighty
satisfying
larry
agreed
and
just
as
satisfying
to
know
the
same
thing
about
your
new
officers
i
m
going
to
feel
pretty
confident
when
we
suddenly
have
six
jap
destroyers
pouncing
on
us
all
of
a
say
i
just
thought
of
something
corvin
said
those
poor
guys
in
that
freighter
are
probably
still
looking
frantically
for
signs
of
a
periscope
and
sitting
there
biting
their
nails
waiting
for
a
torpedo
to
blast
them
to
kingdom
gray
looked
at
his
watch
they
re
just
about
getting
over
that
by
now
he
said
they
re
just
concluding
that
we
an
american
sub
and
not
a
german
and
they
re
thanking
their
lucky
just
like
us
mcfee
added
in
a
few
minutes
the
skipper
went
out
and
ordered
the
sub
up
to
periscope
depth
had
the
scope
run
up
and
took
a
look
around
not
a
thing
in
sight
he
announced
down
as
the
big
shaft
slid
down
into
its
well
in
the
deck
the
skipper
ordered
the
ship
to
surface
once
again
and
up
she
came
gray
was
the
first
man
up
on
the
bridge
and
the
other
officers
quickly
followed
him
lookouts
and
controlmen
took
their
posts
and
the
went
steadily
ahead
on
her
course
corvin
took
over
the
watch
on
the
bridge
and
in
a
little
while
the
others
went
below
the
crew
had
settled
down
and
once
more
everything
was
serene
and
quiet
more
days
went
by
but
without
the
excitement
of
even
a
sight
of
ship
or
plane
after
they
had
passed
into
the
caribbean
sea
the
skipper
ordered
them
to
hold
up
for
two
hours
before
proceeding
we
re
a
bit
ahead
of
schedule
he
explained
because
of
the
extra
speed
we
made
on
the
surface
coming
into
panama
we
ve
got
to
surface
and
run
exactly
on
schedule
and
on
course
patrol
craft
and
planes
are
expecting
us
and
they
ll
bomb
us
out
of
sight
if
we
re
five
minutes
off
schedule
or
two
degrees
off
when
they
resumed
speed
on
the
surface
march
checked
the
boat
s
position
regularly
to
make
sure
of
their
course
the
first
time
a
big
martin
shot
out
of
a
cloud
ahead
of
them
march
felt
his
throat
grow
dry
if
they
were
exactly
where
they
should
be
at
that
moment
he
knew
what
would
happen
to
a
beautiful
new
sub
and
about
good
men
of
uncle
sam
s
navy
but
the
patrol
plane
just
circled
low
overhead
gunned
its
motors
and
flew
away
he
knew
that
its
radio
reported
the
sub
s
position
to
other
patrol
craft
and
that
they
would
be
checked
up
on
regularly
two
other
planes
came
over
for
a
look
on
their
way
in
toward
the
canal
and
for
the
last
miles
they
were
sighted
by
half
a
dozen
surface
ships
are
we
to
go
right
on
through
without
stopping
march
asked
the
skipper
stop
long
enough
to
take
on
the
canal
pilot
he
replied
nothing
the
skipper
was
on
the
bridge
along
with
corvin
as
they
ran
alongside
the
jetty
leading
to
the
first
locks
as
they
tied
up
at
the
dock
below
the
locks
corvin
stepped
ashore
he
came
back
shortly
with
a
man
who
would
pilot
them
through
the
canal
the
weather
was
clear
and
the
sun
beat
down
warmly
so
half
the
crew
were
lined
up
on
the
deck
and
all
hatches
were
open
all
officers
were
on
the
bridge
except
mcfee
who
stayed
below
in
charge
even
stan
left
his
diesels
long
enough
to
come
up
for
a
look
at
the
canal
for
all
the
submarine
s
engines
were
off
as
they
were
pulled
through
the
locks
by
the
little
donkey
engines
running
on
tracks
alongside
the
canal
pilot
came
aboard
and
climbed
to
the
bridge
lines
were
cast
cables
attached
fore
and
aft
to
the
donkey
engines
on
both
sides
and
they
began
to
move
forward
on
the
pilot
s
orders
ahead
march
saw
the
huge
steel
doors
into
the
first
lock
slowly
and
steadily
the
pigboat
moved
into
the
chamber
and
the
great
doors
swung
silently
shut
behind
them
then
water
rushed
into
the
lock
and
the
boat
gently
moved
upward
as
the
surface
of
the
water
rose
soon
they
were
level
with
the
water
in
the
next
lock
and
the
gates
ahead
of
them
swung
back
against
the
walls
they
saw
in
the
lock
next
to
them
a
battered
destroyer
heading
the
other
direction
she
s
been
through
something
all
right
gray
commented
going
home
for
the
crew
on
the
destroyer
waved
to
the
men
on
and
for
a
time
there
were
shouts
back
and
forth
then
they
had
moved
out
of
the
second
lock
into
gatun
lake
as
the
destroyer
sank
down
in
its
lock
toward
the
level
of
the
ocean
sailing
through
the
lake
was
like
a
pleasant
excursion
trip
on
a
lake
steamer
the
thick
jungles
were
unlike
anything
most
of
the
men
had
seen
before
and
they
looked
about
them
with
curiosity
through
the
locks
at
pedro
miguel
and
then
at
little
lake
miraflores
and
they
were
once
more
at
sea
time
at
the
level
of
the
pacific
they
dropped
the
pilot
at
the
edge
of
the
long
breakwater
and
then
headed
out
to
sea
looking
back
at
the
lights
of
the
city
of
panama
which
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
growing
darkness
not
much
time
for
sightseeing
when
you
re
on
submarines
stan
said
as
he
and
march
climbed
down
to
the
control
room
not
when
there
s
a
war
going
on
anyway
march
said
we
re
in
the
pacific
now
stan
how
does
it
feel
just
like
the
atlantic
stan
said
not
to
me
march
mused
this
is
the
ocean
we
re
going
to
do
our
fighting
in
this
is
the
ocean
where
i
ve
already
done
a
fair
amount
of
battling
japs
but
this
time
i
think
i
m
going
to
do
a
lot
chapter
eleven
under
way
again
in
san
francisco
stan
and
march
had
two
days
for
a
little
of
the
sightseeing
they
had
looked
forward
to
but
they
both
spent
most
of
their
time
at
other
tasks
march
passed
several
hours
at
a
telephone
stand
trying
to
get
through
a
call
home
when
it
finally
went
through
he
talked
for
five
minutes
with
his
mother
and
gave
her
his
san
francisco
address
she
sounded
cheerful
and
not
at
all
worried
and
asked
him
if
he
might
see
scoot
bailey
scoot
s
address
is
san
francisco
too
she
said
i
know
march
laughed
and
the
address
of
quite
a
few
thousands
of
other
sailors
and
soldiers
i
think
he
must
have
got
out
of
frisco
before
this
unless
he
was
held
up
here
for
lack
of
transportation
i
might
as
well
try
to
find
out
maybe
you
ll
see
him
out
where
you
re
going
his
mother
said
i
doubt
it
very
much
march
said
even
though
we
did
have
a
joke
about
how
my
submarine
would
probably
have
to
save
him
from
the
japs
out
when
he
finished
talking
to
his
mother
he
decided
he
might
as
well
try
to
find
out
if
scoot
were
still
in
town
he
had
probably
arrived
two
or
three
weeks
before
it
wasn
t
likely
that
he
d
still
be
around
but
sometimes
men
were
held
up
that
long
if
scoot
held
up
that
long
march
said
to
himself
he
d
be
just
about
crazy
i
think
he
d
start
swimming
to
get
out
to
his
carrier
or
plane
or
base
or
wherever
he
ll
march
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
trying
to
find
out
about
scoot
each
office
said
it
didn
t
have
the
information
or
couldn
t
give
it
to
him
until
he
finally
reached
the
right
place
and
learned
that
scoot
had
left
san
francisco
by
plane
for
his
destination
twelve
days
before
he
met
stan
for
dinner
after
which
they
went
to
a
movie
the
skipper
had
given
them
leave
until
a
few
hours
before
they
were
due
to
sail
after
the
movie
stan
and
march
went
back
to
their
ship
to
find
that
ray
corvin
had
suddenly
been
taken
sick
just
as
they
came
up
the
ambulance
was
taking
him
away
to
the
naval
hospital
burst
appendix
i
think
gray
said
and
if
that
s
it
i
don
t
know
what
we
ll
do
i
m
hoping
it
s
nothing
more
than
an
acute
indigestion
that
ll
pass
in
a
day
or
two
but
sallini
felt
sure
it
was
the
appendix
and
so
did
the
doc
that
came
that
s
why
they
rushed
him
right
off
to
the
anything
we
can
do
march
asked
no
just
keep
your
fingers
crossed
gray
said
ray
s
a
mighty
good
man
to
have
aboard
a
why
we
couldn
t
go
without
him
could
we
stan
asked
the
navy
doesn
t
wait
around
for
an
officer
to
get
over
appendicitis
larry
said
we
re
scheduled
to
pull
out
of
here
at
dawn
day
after
tomorrow
morning
and
that
s
when
we
ll
pull
out
with
or
without
ray
what
about
his
family
march
asked
didn
t
he
say
he
lived
near
here
fifty
miles
away
the
skipper
replied
he
had
just
phoned
them
before
he
got
this
attack
i
had
to
tell
them
he
couldn
t
come
down
as
he
d
planned
i
got
in
touch
with
the
commandant
here
and
he
has
sent
a
car
down
there
for
ray
s
wife
and
daughter
they
ll
see
him
at
the
in
the
morning
they
learned
that
corvin
s
appendix
burst
and
he
had
been
operated
on
larry
gray
had
spent
a
good
part
of
the
night
at
the
hospital
he
ll
pull
through
all
right
he
said
wearily
but
it
will
be
weeks
before
he
s
up
and
around
we
re
really
lucky
i
guess
that
it
didn
t
happen
when
we
were
at
sea
if
it
had
to
happen
it
couldn
t
have
timed
itself
better
in
port
near
a
not
far
from
ray
s
home
he
can
go
there
to
what
about
us
stan
asked
it
s
a
shame
we
can
t
have
him
with
us
he
s
a
swell
and
a
fine
officer
gray
said
he
ought
to
have
a
command
of
his
own
really
well
i
m
not
sure
what
we
ll
do
the
navy
can
probably
find
us
another
officer
in
a
hurry
if
we
demand
it
though
it
s
not
easy
to
find
a
good
sub
man
just
like
that
who
isn
t
already
he
shook
his
head
as
he
turned
to
his
quarters
i
m
not
sure
just
what
we
ll
do
he
said
except
that
we
ll
get
under
way
on
at
the
door
he
stopped
march
will
you
and
stan
help
mac
oversee
the
loading
i
ve
got
to
have
a
little
there
wasn
t
much
to
come
aboard
ammunition
and
torpedoes
were
still
intact
so
they
had
to
take
on
only
oil
and
water
and
food
plus
some
special
medical
supplies
for
use
in
tropical
climates
stan
had
ordered
a
few
more
spare
parts
for
his
engines
and
motors
with
his
little
repair
shop
he
felt
able
then
to
take
care
of
almost
anything
that
might
happen
in
his
department
it
was
late
that
afternoon
that
the
skipper
called
march
to
his
quarters
sit
down
march
he
said
i
ve
decided
what
to
do
about
another
officer
but
i
think
i
ought
to
talk
it
over
with
the
rest
of
you
first
to
see
if
you
whatever
you
say
is
all
right
with
the
rest
of
us
larry
march
said
you
know
perhaps
larry
replied
with
a
smile
but
this
involves
a
little
more
work
for
everybody
and
i
want
you
all
to
agree
that
it
s
best
you
see
i
think
we
ve
got
a
good
crew
and
officers
alike
we
get
along
we
know
our
business
getting
along
together
is
mighty
important
in
this
work
and
i
don
t
know
how
another
officer
would
fit
in
even
if
we
could
get
i
know
march
agreed
you
can
never
tell
until
you
ve
lived
in
each
other
s
laps
for
a
while
as
we
so
i
want
to
skip
trying
to
officer
to
replace
ray
the
skipper
went
on
plenty
of
subs
this
size
have
operated
with
four
officers
and
so
can
we
but
we
ll
have
to
split
up
ray
s
okay
with
me
march
said
at
once
what
can
i
take
on
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
alone
first
gray
said
i
want
to
take
over
ray
s
job
you
mean
as
diving
officer
march
said
with
a
thrill
yes
and
as
executive
officer
too
larry
said
march
started
to
say
something
and
then
he
realized
exactly
what
gray
had
said
on
his
first
real
patrol
he
was
asked
to
serve
as
second
in
command
of
a
new
submarine
it
was
unbelievable
he
said
do
you
think
i
can
handle
it
if
think
so
the
skipper
said
with
a
smile
then
i
think
you
can
too
i
think
you
can
handle
just
about
anything
on
a
submarine
that
you
want
to
what
about
mcfee
march
asked
he
s
been
out
with
you
before
he
s
had
more
mcfee
larry
said
mac
s
a
wonder
at
his
job
and
he
could
take
over
just
about
any
other
submarine
job
in
an
emergency
mac
knows
this
as
well
as
i
s
just
not
quite
enough
of
an
executive
to
handle
this
i
know
that
he
just
wouldn
t
want
the
job
he
doesn
t
like
to
tell
people
what
to
do
he
wouldn
t
like
to
be
a
general
manager
and
that
s
what
an
executive
officer
is
well
you
know
him
well
march
said
but
won
t
he
feel
a
little
funny
about
having
a
raw
recruit
so
to
speak
put
over
him
not
mac
larry
answered
he
s
not
like
that
anyway
how
about
it
m
mighty
pleased
that
you
ve
got
enough
confidence
in
me
to
ask
me
march
said
and
i
surely
ought
to
have
as
much
confidence
in
myself
as
someone
else
has
okay
skipper
you
re
swell
march
gray
said
with
a
broad
smile
i
don
t
feel
so
bad
about
not
having
ray
now
we
re
going
to
do
a
job
in
i
just
hope
i
can
navigate
and
dive
and
exec
march
said
all
at
the
same
illustration
want
you
to
take
over
ray
s
job
well
i
never
did
think
a
navigating
officer
had
enough
to
do
just
navigating
gray
said
laughing
and
you
re
never
busy
navigating
when
you
have
to
dive
as
for
being
an
exec
a
sub
with
a
good
crew
doesn
t
need
much
general
managing
you
ll
find
anyway
mac
and
stan
will
help
you
out
in
that
department
if
you
need
any
help
and
don
t
forget
that
there
is
after
all
still
a
skipper
on
the
boat
who
ought
to
do
a
little
work
once
in
a
later
in
the
wardroom
with
stan
and
mac
larry
told
them
all
the
new
setup
and
march
was
happy
to
see
how
obviously
pleased
with
the
arrangement
mcfee
and
stan
were
i
was
worried
mcfee
said
i
was
afraid
you
d
get
another
officer
and
he
d
turn
out
to
be
a
guy
who
pulled
puns
or
was
a
bridge
fiend
or
something
terrible
like
that
and
we
wouldn
t
have
time
to
find
it
out
before
we
got
under
way
so
we
d
have
to
drown
him
at
well
i
d
better
go
report
to
the
commandant
and
tell
him
the
arrangement
larry
said
the
navy
likes
to
know
about
these
things
even
if
they
do
leave
most
decisions
up
to
a
ship
s
after
gray
left
march
stepped
into
the
control
room
scotty
rushed
up
to
him
and
shook
his
hand
vigorously
congratulations
lieutenant
the
radioman
cried
gee
it
s
swell
thanks
scotty
march
grinned
but
how
on
earth
did
the
crew
ever
learn
this
so
fast
didn
t
you
ever
hear
that
the
crew
always
knows
the
important
things
before
the
officers
on
a
sub
scott
said
with
a
laugh
it
must
be
it
must
be
march
replied
with
a
shake
of
his
head
when
larry
gray
returned
from
seeing
the
commandant
march
thought
he
noticed
a
sparkle
in
his
eyes
and
a
smile
on
his
face
that
he
was
trying
not
to
show
what
happened
he
asked
oh
nothing
larry
replied
looking
a
little
embarrassed
i
just
reported
and
he
said
okay
everything
set
for
dawn
everything
set
march
replied
oh
by
the
way
larry
said
as
if
trying
to
change
the
subject
you
move
your
stuff
into
ray
s
quarters
then
you
and
stan
can
both
have
a
little
more
room
to
move
around
okay
skipper
march
answered
could
we
see
ray
before
we
leave
no
no
more
visitors
larry
said
his
family
is
there
and
they
let
me
see
him
for
a
minute
to
say
goodbye
and
good
luck
from
all
of
us
he
s
feeling
pretty
lousy
with
drainage
tubes
in
him
and
worse
than
that
because
he
can
t
go
along
with
us
if
they
d
let
him
he
d
try
to
get
up
and
come
along
right
now
he
says
he
could
recuperate
faster
in
a
sub
anyway
than
on
dry
land
he
highly
approved
of
your
appointment
by
the
it
was
an
hour
later
that
march
learned
the
reason
for
the
skipper
s
hidden
smile
and
slightly
embarrassed
look
noticing
a
new
large
sheet
of
paper
on
the
bulletin
board
in
the
crew
s
quarters
he
paused
to
look
at
it
scuttlebutt
special
it
read
the
brass
hats
have
seen
the
light
at
last
and
promoted
our
old
man
to
lieutenant
commander
it
s
about
time
march
walked
quickly
back
to
the
wardroom
where
he
found
larry
gray
and
mcfee
smoking
and
talking
well
i
was
told
that
the
crew
knew
everything
important
before
the
officers
he
said
but
why
did
you
want
to
keep
it
secret
larry
almost
blushed
oh
so
you
found
out
it
s
on
the
bulletin
board
march
exclaimed
oh
my
golly
these
sub
crews
larry
exclaimed
they
can
even
read
your
thoughts
say
what
s
all
this
about
mac
cried
let
me
in
on
it
go
read
it
for
yourself
march
said
the
skipper
made
me
find
it
out
the
hard
as
mac
squeezed
out
from
behind
the
little
table
and
hurried
down
the
companionway
march
put
out
his
hand
and
shook
larry
s
congratulations
skipper
he
said
thanks
march
gray
said
some
of
the
crew
on
shore
liberty
must
ve
run
into
it
up
at
headquarters
somehow
they
don
t
miss
a
they
not
only
missed
nothing
but
they
did
not
miss
a
chance
to
do
something
about
it
after
mess
a
delegation
from
the
crew
appeared
and
asked
for
an
audience
with
the
skipper
he
sensed
what
was
coming
and
met
them
in
the
control
room
pete
kalinsky
chief
petty
officer
in
the
torpedo
room
was
the
spokesman
lieutenant
commander
gray
sir
he
said
your
crew
is
very
happy
to
see
you
gettin
up
where
you
belong
though
they
ve
got
to
come
through
a
few
more
times
before
it
s
okay
with
us
we
knew
you
wouldn
t
bother
about
such
things
but
the
captain
ought
to
do
himself
proud
so
on
behalf
of
the
crew
i
give
you
he
coughed
acted
as
if
he
were
about
to
add
something
else
then
said
sir
lamely
and
backed
up
larry
took
the
small
packages
pete
had
handed
him
and
undid
them
with
fingers
that
shook
slightly
first
came
a
set
of
three
gold
stripes
two
wide
and
one
narrow
for
his
blue
uniform
then
the
same
in
black
for
his
work
uniform
then
shoulder
insignia
and
finally
two
gold
for
pinning
on
his
shirt
collars
march
who
stood
behind
larry
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
knew
how
larry
must
be
feeling
and
wondered
how
he
could
keep
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
there
was
a
long
silence
and
march
knew
that
larry
was
waiting
for
his
voice
to
get
under
control
before
he
spoke
everyone
was
looking
at
him
as
he
fingered
the
marks
of
his
new
rank
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
his
crew
not
only
had
they
got
the
news
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
happened
but
somebody
had
taken
up
a
collection
and
rushed
downtown
during
his
last
hours
of
shore
leave
to
buy
these
things
for
him
you
know
men
larry
spoke
quietly
it
s
naturally
very
pleasant
to
get
a
promotion
but
when
you
re
about
to
set
out
in
a
pigboat
to
sink
as
many
jap
ships
as
possible
it
doesn
t
seem
very
important
and
certainly
gold
braid
and
pretty
gold
leaves
aren
t
important
at
all
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
really
important
what
really
count
for
a
lot
when
you
re
about
to
get
under
way
for
enemy
waters
that
is
the
knowledge
that
i
have
a
crew
like
mine
i
ve
got
a
crew
that
is
proud
of
its
boat
proud
of
its
skipper
proud
of
itself
a
crew
that
ll
do
what
you
ve
just
it
just
can
t
be
licked
that
s
chapter
twelve
visit
to
wake
island
they
went
all
the
way
to
pearl
harbor
on
the
surface
they
had
beautiful
clear
weather
each
day
jap
ships
and
subs
and
planes
had
been
cleared
from
the
entire
area
so
effectively
that
american
submarines
did
not
need
to
fear
being
mistaken
by
their
own
patrols
for
jap
subs
they
made
good
time
and
the
crew
and
officers
alike
were
happy
in
the
highest
of
spirits
march
laughed
one
day
as
he
looked
down
from
the
bridge
and
saw
clothes
drying
on
the
line
put
there
by
the
crew
who
took
the
first
opportunity
to
give
their
things
a
good
sunning
this
doesn
t
look
much
like
war
he
mused
very
domestic
scene
really
and
some
of
the
men
have
been
on
deck
enough
to
get
a
little
sunburn
not
the
usual
picture
of
the
submariner
pale
and
dehydrated
after
his
long
days
beneath
the
waters
of
the
but
he
knew
there
would
be
plenty
of
that
life
ahead
of
them
he
was
happy
that
this
part
of
the
trip
was
so
pleasant
it
meant
a
lot
to
the
crew
who
were
inclined
sometimes
to
be
superstitious
despite
all
protestations
to
the
contrary
they
felt
that
everything
would
go
well
with
them
since
the
start
of
their
real
patrol
had
been
so
auspicious
the
skipper
had
opened
his
orders
twelve
hours
out
from
san
francisco
they
were
no
great
surprise
to
anyone
they
were
to
go
by
way
of
pearl
harbor
to
a
submarine
base
in
the
southwest
pacific
a
tiny
island
where
a
sub
tender
nursed
its
brood
of
pigboats
fed
them
oil
and
torpedoes
and
supplies
before
sending
them
out
to
break
up
the
jap
shipping
lines
the
stop
at
pearl
harbor
was
short
but
march
enjoyed
it
remembering
when
he
and
scoot
had
left
the
there
heading
back
for
the
united
states
and
their
training
in
submarines
and
airplanes
much
to
his
surprise
there
was
a
letter
for
him
he
had
not
thought
anyone
would
have
a
chance
to
write
since
learning
his
san
francisco
address
the
envelope
a
plain
one
with
a
typed
address
gave
him
no
clue
it
was
from
scoot
dated
three
weeks
before
it
said
in
case
you
come
this
way
you
ll
get
this
i
m
on
the
carrier
heading
for
where
all
of
us
head
when
we
get
out
here
don
t
forget
to
come
and
save
me
from
those
japs
when
i
holler
for
you
that
was
all
but
it
was
good
it
was
just
like
scoot
and
it
made
march
feel
fine
to
read
it
and
to
picture
again
his
old
friend
he
showed
the
note
to
larry
when
he
went
back
to
and
told
him
about
scoot
bailey
sounds
like
a
swell
guy
larry
said
why
couldn
t
he
have
gone
into
submarines
too
s
swell
but
he
s
not
right
for
pigboats
march
said
too
much
of
an
individualist
he
ll
take
orders
fine
do
a
swell
job
but
he
s
best
when
he
s
on
his
own
flying
a
fighter
plane
off
a
carrier
is
just
exactly
right
for
well
you
never
can
we
ll
run
into
him
larry
said
stranger
things
have
happened
in
they
sailed
from
pearl
harbor
looking
for
action
but
several
days
went
by
without
a
sign
of
ship
or
plane
of
any
kind
we
ve
got
to
run
into
something
larry
said
one
day
in
the
wardroom
i
d
hate
to
show
up
at
the
base
with
all
my
torpedoes
intact
without
a
single
jap
ship
accounted
for
why
we
re
going
through
about
nine
hundred
miles
of
enemy
waters
and
we
ve
got
to
get
something
on
the
the
boys
out
here
have
been
scaring
them
into
their
ratholes
mcfee
said
they
don
t
come
out
any
more
than
they
have
but
that
s
the
point
larry
said
they
ve
got
to
come
out
sometime
they
ve
got
garrisons
on
a
lot
of
these
islands
and
garrisons
need
to
be
well
they
re
just
letting
the
garrisons
on
lots
of
those
islands
starve
to
death
stan
said
sure
in
the
marshalls
and
a
few
other
places
where
we
ve
got
em
surrounded
the
skipper
said
but
they
re
still
supplying
and
reinforcing
plenty
of
places
around
these
parts
they
lose
some
ships
every
day
i
just
want
them
to
lose
a
couple
to
us
as
we
re
passing
by
on
our
way
to
more
important
what
about
wake
island
march
asked
yes
they
re
still
supplying
wake
larry
said
we
re
not
too
far
away
from
it
any
more
but
we
haven
t
got
it
really
cut
off
but
our
course
isn
t
very
close
to
couldn
t
we
just
edge
over
that
way
and
have
a
look
march
asked
well
now
maybe
we
could
larry
said
nobody
told
us
just
what
course
to
follow
out
here
when
we
get
a
bit
further
we
ve
got
to
run
submerged
most
of
the
time
anyway
we
just
laid
down
the
straightest
route
to
our
destination
but
a
little
detour
wouldn
t
do
any
harm
lieutenant
anson
carry
us
over
near
with
a
smile
march
left
the
wardroom
and
went
to
the
navigating
desk
there
he
plotted
the
course
for
wake
island
went
up
on
the
conning
tower
for
a
shot
of
the
sun
to
check
his
course
and
gave
the
new
course
to
the
helmsman
then
he
went
back
to
the
wardroom
about
six
hundred
time
courtesy
of
whoozis
watches
he
announced
we
shall
sight
wake
hm
works
out
very
nicely
larry
said
tomorrow
morning
just
after
dawn
we
can
travel
on
the
surface
all
night
and
submerge
just
before
the
everyone
was
up
and
about
early
the
next
morning
even
those
who
had
been
on
watch
during
the
night
breakfast
was
over
and
officers
and
men
were
at
their
stations
before
dawn
we
may
get
nothing
of
course
larry
said
we
mustn
t
get
our
hopes
okay
skipper
mcfee
said
we
re
just
dropping
by
for
a
look
and
if
anything
s
there
we
ll
try
to
take
care
of
rig
ship
for
diving
the
skipper
said
and
the
word
was
passed
throughout
the
boat
one
by
one
the
departments
reported
back
to
march
that
everything
was
ready
the
long
slim
boat
slid
under
the
water
the
whine
of
the
electric
motors
replacing
the
throbbing
of
the
diesels
as
march
handled
the
diving
operations
he
recalled
the
days
when
it
had
seemed
to
him
such
a
complicated
and
difficult
task
now
it
was
a
simple
straightforward
job
especially
when
carried
out
by
a
crew
that
knew
its
job
after
about
twenty
minutes
march
turned
to
larry
i
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
have
a
look
now
he
said
up
periscope
larry
said
reaching
forward
to
grab
the
adjusting
handles
as
they
rose
into
position
he
adjusted
the
eyepiece
and
looked
focussing
with
the
handles
march
saw
his
mouth
open
slightly
in
a
whispered
exclamation
have
a
look
march
he
said
i
think
we
ve
raised
march
looked
and
saw
the
atolls
where
the
marines
had
for
so
long
battled
the
japs
against
great
odds
it
would
do
his
heart
good
to
kill
a
few
japs
at
wake
entirely
apart
from
the
excellence
of
the
idea
in
general
he
located
the
harbor
and
then
saw
two
dark
blobs
in
it
there
s
something
there
all
right
he
said
can
t
be
sure
what
they
are
yet
down
scope
larry
said
we
ll
get
a
little
closer
and
have
another
there
was
almost
nothing
said
as
the
boat
moved
silently
forward
under
the
water
until
larry
ordered
the
periscope
up
again
then
he
exclaimed
aloud
at
what
he
saw
three
of
em
he
cried
looks
as
if
they
just
got
here
themselves
probably
came
in
under
cover
of
darkness
lighters
are
just
tying
up
to
them
to
what
are
they
march
asked
can
you
make
out
one
s
a
troopship
larry
replied
loaded
to
the
gunwales
the
men
ll
go
ashore
in
the
lighters
they
haven
t
even
started
yet
must
be
relief
for
the
ones
will
be
going
illustration
adjusted
the
eyepiece
and
oh
no
they
won
t
march
said
not
yet
anyway
because
their
relief
is
going
to
be
cut
down
in
number
right
soon
here
march
have
a
look
larry
said
i
think
one
s
a
tanker
one
an
ammunition
ship
or
a
freighter
with
the
march
stepped
to
the
periscope
and
looked
carefully
tanker
and
troopship
are
certain
he
said
can
t
be
sure
about
the
other
though
how
many
do
you
think
we
can
get
not
more
than
two
larry
said
they
ll
get
planes
after
us
that
fast
we
ll
have
to
get
away
after
two
maybe
after
one
can
t
tell
until
we
re
in
the
middle
of
it
but
what
about
all
the
reefs
around
here
can
we
get
in
position
to
fire
if
we
re
good
we
can
march
said
come
on
i
ll
show
you
i
ve
been
studying
the
wake
island
chart
and
we
know
it
s
larry
followed
march
to
the
navigation
desk
where
they
both
studied
the
chart
of
wake
island
we
have
to
go
west
first
march
said
then
cut
back
sharply
in
a
hairpin
in
about
four
hundred
yards
turn
about
thirty
degrees
to
starboard
without
going
forward
too
much
fire
and
then
back
away
backing
will
be
slow
but
we
can
t
turn
her
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
think
we
can
make
it
deep
water
out
here
larry
asked
pointing
to
a
point
about
a
mile
off
shore
plenty
deep
march
replied
then
i
think
we
can
do
it
larry
said
those
ships
are
worth
the
chance
anyway
if
we
re
slow
getting
the
first
one
we
ll
cut
and
which
one
first
march
asked
the
tanker
larry
said
most
important
planes
can
t
fly
without
the
gas
and
oil
it
not
the
troopship
no
too
many
of
the
men
will
be
able
to
swim
or
get
ashore
some
way
larry
said
we
could
count
on
about
fifty
percent
casualties
there
but
the
ll
be
all
gone
and
maybe
set
fire
to
a
few
other
things
tanker
first
then
the
skipper
gave
orders
to
move
the
boat
to
the
west
around
the
reefs
as
march
had
indicated
march
stood
close
by
the
soundman
who
could
tell
at
every
instant
just
how
far
they
were
from
the
rocky
shoals
that
might
trap
them
slowly
the
boat
moved
forward
and
then
when
march
gave
the
word
it
turned
and
moved
in
toward
the
island
i
hope
i
m
right
march
said
to
himself
there
s
not
very
much
room
here
though
if
those
ships
got
through
we
surely
the
sound
man
picked
up
reefs
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
ahead
and
march
breathed
more
deeply
they
went
forward
for
a
few
moments
still
moving
slowly
about
now
march
larry
asked
quietly
yes
this
ought
to
be
it
march
replied
he
saw
scotty
at
the
soundman
s
side
the
other
crew
members
standing
by
their
levers
and
valves
they
were
all
calm
and
quiet
but
with
just
a
touch
of
excited
expectancy
in
their
manner
the
skipper
gave
the
order
for
the
turn
to
starboard
for
the
cutting
of
motors
then
he
called
for
the
periscope
as
it
rose
from
its
well
in
the
deck
he
crouched
and
grabbed
it
then
march
realized
why
larry
was
a
good
skipper
in
just
about
two
seconds
he
had
seen
everything
there
was
to
see
he
called
out
the
course
settings
for
the
torpedoes
first
for
two
to
go
into
the
sides
of
the
tanker
then
for
two
to
go
into
the
sides
of
the
transport
the
settings
were
called
back
to
him
and
he
called
without
a
moment
s
fire
one
fire
two
he
waited
a
moment
glancing
at
his
watch
fire
three
fire
four
stepping
away
from
the
eyepiece
he
called
down
periscope
and
followed
it
immediately
with
reverse
motors
as
the
whine
of
the
motors
started
and
the
boat
slid
backwards
in
the
water
he
kept
his
eyes
on
his
watch
finger
in
the
air
as
if
counting
he
lifted
his
eyes
the
submarine
trembled
and
shook
from
the
explosion
of
a
torpedo
against
the
side
of
a
ship
there
was
a
wild
cry
throughout
the
pigboat
as
the
crew
whooped
with
glee
so
loud
that
it
almost
drowned
out
the
roar
of
the
second
torpedo
hitting
home
against
the
tanker
men
danced
and
jigged
but
not
for
a
moment
did
they
take
their
hands
from
their
levers
or
wheels
or
their
eyes
from
the
dials
they
watched
you
can
turn
now
skipper
march
said
quietly
and
larry
gave
the
order
for
the
ship
to
turn
and
dive
deep
as
it
cleared
the
reefs
the
words
were
not
out
of
his
mouth
when
another
roar
sent
a
tremble
through
the
submarine
and
another
shout
arose
it
was
a
short
roar
because
the
men
stopped
to
listen
for
the
second
torpedo
that
had
been
sent
against
the
troopship
but
nothing
came
and
it
was
larry
who
broke
the
silence
a
miss
men
he
said
only
one
got
well
what
can
you
expect
scotty
demanded
after
all
the
position
we
were
in
are
still
in
larry
exclaimed
only
a
hundred
feet
take
her
to
everybody
adjusted
his
body
to
the
slope
of
the
boat
as
it
slid
rapidly
down
in
the
water
in
a
few
minutes
they
knew
depth
charges
would
be
dropped
in
an
attempt
to
locate
them
certainly
planes
would
be
in
the
air
and
perhaps
fast
small
boats
something
like
our
own
would
be
dashing
out
of
the
harbor
after
them
larry
grabbed
the
phone
from
the
interphone
orderly
and
spoke
into
it
you
heard
the
blasts
he
said
knowing
that
men
all
over
the
boat
would
hear
him
two
into
a
jap
tanker
one
into
a
troopship
second
one
there
was
a
dud
you
can
expect
some
depth
charges
but
i
think
we
ll
be
down
away
from
them
later
we
ll
go
up
for
a
look
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
march
knew
that
all
the
men
appreciated
that
they
were
tense
and
excited
and
they
wanted
to
know
exactly
what
was
going
on
their
skipper
didn
t
keep
them
waiting
long
they
were
part
of
this
just
as
much
as
he
was
they
leveled
off
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
just
as
they
felt
the
first
bumping
rattle
of
a
depth
charge
explosion
but
it
was
far
away
and
hardly
bothered
them
in
two
minutes
another
came
a
little
closer
everyone
gripped
the
nearest
solid
support
and
held
on
march
said
to
himself
you
re
going
through
a
depth
bombing
this
was
the
one
thing
they
couldn
t
simulate
at
new
london
well
how
do
you
like
it
and
he
answered
himself
it
s
not
so
he
looked
around
at
the
men
in
the
crew
they
held
on
and
they
listened
but
they
did
not
look
frightened
larry
grinned
at
him
lousy
aim
they
ve
got
he
said
they
re
not
coming
very
what
about
a
little
zigzagging
march
asked
no
we
might
zig
or
zag
into
something
larry
said
they
obviously
haven
t
located
us
and
are
just
dropping
at
random
also
we
re
deep
enough
to
be
below
the
explosions
after
all
the
biggest
force
of
the
blow
is
above
the
exploding
charge
we
ll
just
keep
sliding
along
the
way
we
re
going
they
ll
give
up
after
a
the
charges
exploded
regularly
but
not
for
long
soon
they
hardly
felt
a
jar
when
one
went
off
they
think
we
re
hanging
around
back
there
for
a
look
larry
said
they
don
t
know
how
safe
we
play
i
m
not
going
back
for
my
look
for
two
hours
so
just
keep
they
did
keep
going
and
for
two
hours
by
the
time
they
circled
around
and
came
back
toward
the
island
there
were
no
more
depth
charges
about
a
mile
away
they
surfaced
quickly
and
the
skipper
took
a
quick
look
then
the
scope
went
down
and
march
ordered
another
dive
sorry
you
couldn
t
have
had
a
look
march
larry
said
but
i
didn
he
was
interrupted
by
a
shaking
roar
that
almost
spilled
him
off
his
feet
march
who
had
one
hand
against
the
bulkhead
grabbed
him
as
i
was
saying
larry
went
on
with
a
smile
i
didn
t
want
to
keep
the
scope
up
any
longer
than
i
had
to
they
spotted
it
pretty
fast
didn
t
they
another
roar
was
the
answer
followed
by
another
and
another
and
half
a
dozen
more
they
were
bad
shocks
worse
than
those
they
had
experienced
at
first
but
the
sub
had
got
down
fast
enough
to
get
away
from
the
worst
effects
what
did
you
see
march
asked
between
blasts
listen
larry
said
he
took
the
interphone
and
gave
his
news
to
the
whole
ship
tanker
the
bow
showing
water
blazing
over
the
entire
bay
total
loss
for
the
nips
on
that
one
troopship
looks
half
busted
in
two
but
still
afloat
though
listing
badly
no
men
on
her
plenty
of
bodies
in
the
water
lots
got
ashore
i
m
sure
but
plenty
got
burned
in
the
oil
trying
to
make
a
loud
cheer
rose
through
the
ship
as
larry
handed
the
phone
back
to
the
orderly
well
anyway
he
said
it
was
certainly
worth
four
torpedoes
as
the
slid
down
through
the
dark
waters
the
depth
charges
grew
less
intense
finally
they
got
away
from
them
entirely
and
resumed
the
course
for
their
southwest
pacific
base
don
t
let
that
fool
you
larry
said
as
they
sat
in
the
wardroom
having
a
cup
of
coffee
there
weren
t
any
sound
detectors
there
so
we
got
away
pretty
easily
when
the
destroyers
are
after
you
they
their
depth
charges
are
bigger
this
was
a
setup
chapter
thirteen
scoot
meets
two
zeros
scoot
bailey
lounged
in
the
ready
room
of
the
aircraft
carrier
as
the
big
ship
plunged
through
heavy
seas
at
top
speed
they
had
been
at
sea
for
some
weeks
now
in
company
with
a
cruiser
and
three
destroyers
heading
southwest
from
pearl
harbor
for
scenes
of
battle
for
the
last
two
days
the
five
ships
had
put
on
full
steam
and
everyone
aboard
knew
that
something
was
up
something
s
cooking
up
ahead
scoot
said
to
turk
bottomley
who
sat
next
to
him
legs
stretched
out
on
a
straightback
in
front
of
him
obviously
my
friend
turk
said
something
s
been
cooking
in
this
part
of
the
world
almost
all
the
time
i
thought
we
d
be
heading
for
the
marshalls
and
the
carolines
scoot
said
to
get
in
on
the
fighting
there
but
i
guess
they
ve
got
things
well
in
hand
in
those
parts
we
re
well
past
them
now
and
to
the
no
flying
for
two
days
now
turk
said
that
s
what
s
been
bothering
me
before
we
got
off
once
in
a
while
for
a
look
around
anyway
i
want
to
fly
that
s
all
i
won
t
worry
about
where
let
the
admirals
send
me
where
they
want
me
but
let
me
fly
and
fight
when
i
get
if
possible
on
the
way
gee
i
thought
i
loved
flying
scoot
said
with
a
laugh
but
i
never
held
a
candle
to
yeah
i
even
resent
walkin
turk
said
seems
like
i
should
ve
had
wings
instead
of
for
gettin
around
short
distances
i
d
still
want
that
grumman
hellcat
for
longer
they
re
sweet
ships
all
right
scoot
said
i
used
to
dream
of
flying
a
there
just
couldn
t
be
anything
better
than
that
and
i
still
thought
so
when
i
finally
flew
one
off
the
training
carrier
she
was
an
old
one
but
still
a
wildcat
then
when
i
get
here
on
the
i
find
the
brand
new
hellcat
is
the
right
name
they
re
what
a
wildcat
pilot
dreams
up
as
impossibly
perfect
when
he
thinks
about
what
kind
of
plane
he
ll
have
in
poetic
now
aren
t
you
scoot
turk
said
i
can
t
put
words
together
that
way
but
it
sounds
nice
when
you
talk
about
planes
sometimes
when
you
get
real
excited
you
almost
talk
the
way
i
suddenly
they
sat
up
as
did
the
four
or
five
others
in
the
large
room
other
pilots
began
to
pile
into
the
room
followed
by
most
of
the
officers
on
the
ship
it
comes
scoot
said
now
we
ll
find
out
it
looks
like
a
there
were
fighter
pilots
the
pilots
gunners
and
observers
of
torpedo
and
scout
dive
bombers
and
the
squadron
leaders
of
each
group
accompanied
by
the
particular
in
command
of
the
force
now
racing
across
the
pacific
this
rugged
gentleman
lost
little
time
in
getting
down
to
business
addressing
the
flying
officers
before
him
while
other
officers
hung
a
huge
map
on
the
wall
behind
he
quickly
gave
them
the
information
they
wanted
you
ve
all
known
we
ve
been
heading
for
something
as
fast
as
we
could
get
there
he
said
in
clipped
tones
now
i
can
tell
you
because
we
ve
made
speed
and
are
not
far
away
within
a
few
hours
we
should
contact
other
carriers
and
ships
going
to
the
same
objective
that
objective
is
the
jap
naval
base
at
there
was
a
gasp
of
surprise
throughout
the
room
as
the
admiral
paused
for
a
second
there
s
a
mighty
fine
batch
of
ships
in
truk
harbor
he
said
and
we
have
reason
to
believe
not
too
much
protection
there
ll
be
six
of
go
in
close
enough
to
launch
all
planes
battleships
cruisers
and
destroyers
will
go
in
turk
bottomley
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
as
if
he
would
bound
from
the
room
and
race
to
his
plane
in
a
second
but
the
admiral
continued
the
time
is
now
about
we
shall
rendezvous
with
the
others
of
the
task
force
at
about
you
will
take
off
on
a
schedule
your
squadron
commanders
will
give
you
beginning
at
arriving
over
truk
about
first
wave
that
is
all
scout
and
torpedo
planes
will
go
to
truk
the
fighters
will
remain
as
protection
with
or
near
the
carrier
your
squadron
commanders
will
go
over
all
necessary
details
with
you
now
that
is
the
admiral
stalked
from
the
room
and
the
commanders
prepared
to
go
over
all
details
they
launched
at
once
into
detailed
descriptions
of
the
objective
the
schedule
of
flights
if
we
ve
figured
right
one
of
them
said
we
ll
stick
around
two
days
throwing
in
wave
after
wave
we
must
meet
our
schedule
because
it
ties
in
precisely
with
the
schedules
of
the
other
carriers
in
the
group
we
ll
not
give
them
a
minute
to
catch
their
breath
there
ll
be
planes
coming
at
them
for
two
hours
the
briefing
session
continued
photographs
and
maps
were
shown
man
after
man
asked
questions
finally
every
flier
felt
that
he
knew
truk
and
its
environs
as
he
knew
his
own
home
town
then
came
the
announcement
of
the
fliers
who
would
remain
with
the
carrier
instead
of
going
to
the
attack
on
truk
and
there
were
groans
about
the
room
as
men
heard
their
names
called
one
minute
the
fighter
squadron
commander
called
i
think
the
old
man
gave
a
wrong
impression
the
names
i
m
calling
won
t
stay
with
the
carrier
both
days
they
ll
stay
behind
the
first
day
but
go
on
to
the
attack
the
second
day
while
the
first
group
remains
with
the
groans
turned
to
laughter
but
turk
bottomley
was
furious
he
was
going
out
the
first
day
but
he
wanted
to
go
out
the
second
day
too
he
made
his
feelings
known
in
no
uncertain
terms
never
mind
turk
the
commander
laughed
you
can
go
up
and
fly
around
and
around
the
all
day
so
it
was
that
turk
flew
off
in
the
dark
morning
hours
while
scoot
bailey
stayed
behind
envying
those
lucky
men
whose
names
had
been
opposite
the
odd
numbers
on
the
list
instead
of
the
even
as
plane
after
plane
rolled
across
the
heaving
deck
of
the
and
roared
off
into
the
overcast
sky
scoot
muttered
under
his
breath
wishing
that
each
one
might
have
been
his
dawn
came
and
there
was
no
word
scoot
went
up
with
half
a
dozen
other
fighters
to
keep
eyes
on
the
sea
to
attack
any
japanese
craft
that
came
through
to
get
them
but
for
hours
there
was
no
sign
of
a
of
the
enemy
or
of
their
own
then
scoot
just
after
he
had
landed
again
heard
them
far
roar
of
many
powerful
engines
and
in
a
moment
he
saw
the
tiny
specks
that
raced
so
fast
they
soon
became
planes
circling
in
mighty
sweeps
around
the
carrier
the
first
one
came
in
as
the
signalman
waved
his
paddles
for
a
landing
deck
men
and
the
fighter
pilots
who
were
not
up
in
the
air
lined
the
edge
of
the
deck
and
officers
crowded
the
bridge
as
the
first
pilot
scrambled
from
his
plane
the
deck
crew
grabbed
it
folded
its
wings
and
raced
it
back
to
the
elevator
so
the
next
plane
could
land
in
a
moment
the
pilot
was
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
joined
by
another
then
another
and
another
we
caught
em
with
their
pants
down
the
first
yelled
flatfooted
we
caught
em
right
on
the
airfields
they
couldn
t
get
and
when
the
bombers
came
in
cried
the
next
they
had
a
clear
field
how
those
boys
dove
oil
tanks
blew
up
ships
strewn
all
over
the
place
clogging
up
the
harbor
one
after
another
the
pilots
told
their
stories
while
mechanics
checked
their
engines
filled
the
tanks
with
gas
the
guns
with
ammunition
they
all
told
of
how
the
japs
had
been
taken
by
surprise
how
plane
after
plane
had
been
wrecked
on
the
field
how
torpedo
planes
and
bombers
came
in
with
little
more
than
scattered
antiaircraft
fire
to
get
in
their
way
we
ve
hardly
lost
a
plane
so
far
one
said
and
have
we
got
planes
around
there
i
haven
t
seen
so
many
planes
since
i
was
at
corpus
these
are
not
trainers
fighters
torpedo
planes
in
like
flocks
of
wild
geese
why
i
was
just
as
worried
trying
not
to
bump
into
some
of
our
own
craft
as
by
any
opposition
the
japs
put
up
the
old
man
must
be
mighty
happy
has
he
got
full
reports
he
s
gettin
em
right
this
minute
the
executive
officer
of
the
carrier
replied
he
s
up
there
himself
in
a
scout
looking
over
the
whole
business
and
you
can
bet
your
bottom
dollar
he
s
the
happiest
man
on
earth
what
was
prettiest
another
joined
in
was
seeing
the
planes
from
the
other
carriers
coming
in
from
every
direction
we
were
in
the
first
wave
and
just
as
we
pulled
up
and
away
there
they
number
two
from
the
northeast
and
a
little
farther
away
wave
number
three
from
the
southeast
you
had
to
hurry
and
do
your
job
so
you
could
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
next
batch
coming
where
s
turk
bottomley
scoot
asked
did
any
of
you
see
him
i
saw
him
circling
around
for
another
go
at
one
of
the
airfields
a
pilot
said
at
least
i
think
it
was
turk
s
hellcat
i
saw
he
was
joining
up
with
the
second
wave
and
going
in
he
ought
to
be
back
by
now
someone
said
all
the
other
fighters
are
tommy
mixler
i
saw
him
go
down
in
the
harbor
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
at
this
unwanted
mention
of
a
casualty
of
a
friend
they
d
see
no
more
and
if
they
were
forcibly
clearing
their
minds
of
any
such
pilots
went
on
chattering
again
their
planes
were
almost
ready
for
them
to
take
off
again
when
they
all
saw
a
lone
fighter
circling
the
ship
zooming
his
engine
and
doing
a
beautiful
turn
the
pilot
brought
his
plane
around
into
the
wind
for
a
landing
on
the
heaving
deck
of
the
carrier
that
s
turk
all
right
scoot
said
home
from
the
and
it
was
turk
almost
out
of
gas
and
completely
out
of
ammunition
he
had
stayed
around
as
long
as
he
could
and
now
he
wanted
to
be
off
again
within
five
minutes
as
soon
as
his
plane
was
shoved
out
of
the
way
where
it
could
be
checked
and
get
its
new
supplies
of
gas
and
ammunition
the
fighters
who
had
come
in
earlier
began
to
take
off
again
they
were
off
on
schedule
going
in
for
their
second
attack
on
japan
s
pearl
harbor
of
the
pacific
all
day
long
it
went
on
with
scoot
and
the
others
staying
aloft
on
the
alert
for
the
jap
planes
that
would
surely
come
through
to
attack
them
no
matter
how
great
the
surprise
some
planes
would
get
off
the
airfields
at
truk
and
others
would
race
in
from
other
jap
strongholds
they
would
go
for
the
carriers
first
of
course
for
the
were
the
big
prizes
with
the
base
ship
gone
the
planes
would
be
lost
without
a
home
to
return
to
illustration
fighters
stayed
with
the
but
scoot
searched
in
vain
through
the
skies
as
the
afternoon
turned
to
evening
the
hill
own
planes
came
back
for
the
last
time
but
still
no
japs
appeared
scoot
was
day
long
without
a
crack
at
a
jap
and
they
were
right
in
the
heart
of
what
the
nips
considered
their
private
ocean
is
there
anything
left
of
truk
for
us
to
get
he
asked
that
night
didn
t
everything
get
blasted
off
the
map
there
ll
be
plenty
left
for
everybody
the
squadron
commander
replied
we
ve
got
half
the
ships
in
the
harbor
and
we
ll
get
most
of
the
rest
tomorrow
some
of
them
scattered
and
ran
but
the
boys
from
the
carriers
to
the
north
are
catching
them
there
are
emergency
airfields
around
that
will
be
in
use
tomorrow
and
you
can
be
sure
that
there
ll
be
planes
from
other
jap
garrisons
in
this
area
you
boys
will
have
a
fight
on
your
hands
tomorrow
all
we
d
better
have
scoot
exclaimed
imagine
not
a
lousy
jap
showed
up
today
it
was
with
grim
anger
that
scoot
took
off
the
next
morning
reveling
in
the
almost
unlimited
power
of
his
hellcat
as
it
roared
up
into
the
blue
skies
and
circled
heading
for
truk
scoot
was
in
the
squadron
leader
s
group
and
their
objective
was
the
big
airfield
south
of
the
city
the
japs
would
have
been
working
on
it
all
night
despite
constant
attacks
by
the
bombers
and
they
d
have
at
least
one
landing
strip
in
shape
for
their
planes
to
get
off
the
fighters
were
to
strafe
the
field
then
go
up
as
protective
cover
for
the
dive
bombers
these
would
be
coming
into
the
harbor
right
after
them
to
get
the
rest
of
the
ships
that
still
lay
there
roaring
low
over
the
choppy
waters
of
the
pacific
the
speedy
planes
raced
toward
the
tiny
group
of
islands
that
the
japs
had
made
into
a
great
naval
fortress
a
fortress
that
was
being
knocked
to
pieces
by
american
planes
as
they
approached
the
island
scoot
saw
ahead
several
american
cruisers
and
half
a
dozen
destroyers
they
re
doing
it
boys
his
squadron
leader
s
voice
came
over
the
radio
the
surface
ships
are
moving
in
close
to
shell
the
island
scoot
almost
laughed
in
happiness
it
was
daring
enough
for
american
carriers
to
penetrate
supposedly
japanese
waters
and
give
a
pasting
to
their
impregnable
fort
carriers
could
stay
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
out
while
their
planes
flew
in
to
the
attack
and
they
were
fast
ships
which
could
get
away
in
a
hurry
if
they
needed
to
but
here
were
the
ships
moving
to
within
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
to
shell
the
island
and
the
jap
navy
was
either
hiding
or
running
its
own
back
yard
the
fighter
planes
gunned
their
engines
in
greeting
as
they
passed
the
american
ships
and
scoot
could
see
the
crews
waving
and
laughing
happily
on
the
decks
of
the
ships
they
ll
start
their
shelling
just
about
the
time
the
dive
bombers
finish
the
first
part
of
their
job
scoot
guessed
and
when
they
ve
pounded
away
a
couple
of
hours
the
bombers
will
come
back
in
again
for
another
up
ahead
lay
the
island
at
better
than
three
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
huge
flight
of
fighters
went
over
the
shore
heading
straight
for
the
airfield
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
twenty
or
thirty
jap
fighters
high
above
them
did
not
even
notice
the
bursts
of
shells
that
puffed
around
and
ahead
of
them
they
were
too
low
and
traveling
too
fast
for
to
be
very
effective
or
as
for
those
zeros
the
american
planes
would
take
care
of
them
in
just
a
few
minutes
scoot
saw
the
airfield
up
ahead
saw
jap
planes
on
the
runways
ready
to
take
off
and
the
next
minute
he
was
roaring
over
the
field
not
thirty
feet
above
the
runway
watching
the
jap
ground
crews
running
for
cover
seeing
a
few
firing
rifles
futilely
into
the
air
at
the
speeding
planes
he
pressed
the
button
and
felt
the
slight
backward
push
to
the
plane
as
the
battery
of
fifty
caliber
machine
guns
poured
out
its
converging
fire
of
destruction
jap
after
jap
fleeing
toward
the
hangars
was
cut
down
in
his
tracks
scoot
concentrated
a
terrific
burst
of
fire
on
the
plane
directly
ahead
of
him
saw
a
flash
as
it
caught
fire
then
pulled
up
and
away
with
a
shout
that
could
have
been
heard
half
a
mile
away
had
not
the
air
been
filled
with
the
roar
of
powerful
engines
he
circled
and
came
back
over
the
field
the
other
way
this
time
dipping
to
pour
a
hail
of
lead
into
the
open
doors
of
a
hangar
how
did
the
other
boys
happen
to
leave
that
one
standing
scoot
wondered
the
others
are
all
down
in
it
was
not
easy
to
demolish
a
big
hangar
with
a
fighting
plane
so
scoot
left
that
for
the
bombers
knowing
that
he
had
taken
care
of
a
few
japs
huddling
inside
the
building
and
had
put
forty
or
fifty
holes
in
the
plane
standing
near
the
front
after
one
more
sweep
over
the
field
he
pointed
his
hellcat
s
nose
at
the
sun
and
climbed
but
there
was
something
up
there
on
the
sun
he
thought
looking
intently
sunspots
what
a
funny
thing
to
think
of
at
a
moment
like
this
he
d
hardly
be
noticing
he
almost
instinctively
notice
jap
zeros
when
they
were
diving
at
him
out
of
the
sun
that
s
what
they
are
scoot
exclaimed
but
they
made
one
big
mistake
they
thought
we
were
going
to
strafe
the
field
a
couple
more
times
and
they
d
come
down
on
us
out
of
the
sun
while
we
were
busy
doing
it
i
ll
bet
they
re
confused
now
seeing
us
coming
right
up
at
them
the
first
groups
of
the
fighter
squadrons
were
all
aiming
for
the
clouds
after
their
attack
on
the
field
while
the
next
groups
were
carrying
on
the
strafing
job
and
scoot
knew
too
that
two
groups
were
high
in
the
air
serving
as
cover
for
just
such
a
jap
attack
those
nips
may
not
know
it
he
muttered
to
himself
but
i
ll
bet
there
s
a
flock
of
hellcats
coming
out
of
the
sun
right
behind
the
zeros
were
larger
now
growing
larger
every
minute
as
they
dived
down
at
the
formations
of
american
planes
trying
to
climb
away
from
the
field
it
looked
as
if
all
the
planes
were
determined
to
crash
into
each
other
at
the
greatest
possible
speed
scoot
heard
a
short
command
come
over
the
radio
from
his
squadron
leader
he
grinned
just
what
i
thought
he
d
do
he
told
himself
and
then
shoved
the
stick
hard
to
the
right
as
he
pulled
back
on
the
throttle
the
american
group
split
half
going
to
the
right
half
to
the
left
in
a
maneuver
so
sudden
and
sharp
that
the
japs
in
their
zeros
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
at
seeing
planes
which
had
been
almost
in
their
gunsights
disappear
so
quickly
they
still
thought
that
their
lightly
armored
zeros
were
the
most
highly
maneuverable
planes
in
the
world
they
d
not
had
much
experience
yet
with
the
new
hellcats
scoot
s
wing
tipped
sharply
and
the
craft
seemed
to
stall
then
giving
her
the
gun
again
he
flipped
completely
over
he
knew
that
the
japs
in
that
part
of
a
second
would
have
roared
past
the
spot
he
had
just
been
in
and
now
the
american
planes
could
chase
on
down
toward
the
field
coming
in
from
the
side
and
rear
there
they
are
scoot
cried
just
about
set
up
in
position
the
first
jap
planes
were
pulling
up
desperately
from
their
dive
attempting
to
get
back
in
position
to
meet
the
attack
of
the
americans
scoot
picked
the
leading
jap
plane
got
it
in
his
sights
and
roared
up
on
it
from
a
little
below
he
held
his
fire
held
it
a
fraction
of
a
second
longer
then
pushed
the
button
with
a
vicious
jab
that
almost
drove
it
out
of
its
socket
black
smoke
crept
back
from
the
zero
then
flame
which
fast
grew
into
a
huge
sheet
of
fire
enveloping
the
entire
craft
it
slowed
seemed
to
stagger
a
moment
in
the
air
losing
power
at
once
because
of
its
climbing
position
it
twisted
and
turned
as
scoot
pulled
up
and
away
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
blazing
zero
as
it
first
lazily
then
faster
and
the
ground
is
it
going
by
golly
scoot
cried
as
the
flaming
plane
crashed
into
the
huge
hangar
still
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
jap
field
below
there
was
a
roar
of
fire
a
great
cloud
of
black
smoke
and
scoot
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loud
and
long
who
said
a
fighter
couldn
t
take
care
of
a
hangar
he
demanded
why
did
i
think
i
had
to
leave
it
for
the
bombers
boy
oh
boy
is
that
good
that
s
puttin
em
in
the
right
pocket
scoot
it
was
the
voice
of
his
squadron
leader
over
the
radio
but
watch
out
behind
you
a
little
sneak
attack
coming
yes
there
were
two
japs
coming
in
on
him
now
where
did
they
come
from
scoot
wondered
but
he
didn
t
spend
much
time
on
that
question
for
he
had
other
things
to
do
if
these
japs
weren
t
familiar
enough
with
what
the
new
hellcats
could
do
he
d
show
em
so
instead
of
diving
to
get
away
as
he
knew
they
expected
he
put
his
fighter
into
a
steep
climb
that
pulled
him
up
toward
the
clouds
as
if
a
giant
hand
had
reached
down
and
grabbed
him
that
took
the
first
jap
by
surprise
as
scoot
hoped
but
the
second
had
just
enough
time
to
meet
the
maneuver
as
scoot
closed
in
on
the
first
he
knew
that
the
second
was
coming
in
behind
him
he
concentrated
on
one
thing
at
a
time
maybe
he
thought
he
could
take
care
of
the
first
one
fast
and
get
away
quickly
enough
with
a
roar
of
speed
he
brought
the
first
jap
into
range
opened
fire
saw
smoke
and
waited
no
longer
he
plunged
into
a
diving
turn
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
second
jap
ship
already
plunging
earthward
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
who
did
that
scoot
demanded
almost
to
himself
i
did
my
friend
it
was
turk
bottomley
s
voice
what
are
you
doing
here
scoot
demanded
no
jap
planes
showed
up
at
the
carrier
scoot
said
so
the
old
man
let
a
few
of
us
come
over
to
have
some
fun
i
just
got
and
just
in
time
lad
scoot
said
don
t
mention
it
turk
laughed
the
pleasure
was
all
so
that
is
how
scoot
managed
to
paint
two
little
jap
flags
on
the
side
of
his
plane
the
next
day
as
the
steamed
westward
away
from
a
smoking
and
flaming
truk
that
s
something
like
it
scoot
exclaimed
to
himself
i
ll
bet
poor
old
march
isn
t
having
any
fun
like
this
cooped
up
in
that
stuffy
it
was
at
that
moment
that
march
was
listening
with
pleasure
to
the
explosion
of
the
torpedoes
against
the
sides
of
a
jap
tanker
at
wake
island
chapter
fourteen
crash
landing
was
ranged
with
fourteen
other
submarines
alongside
the
tender
at
the
little
island
base
in
the
southwest
pacific
the
crossing
after
the
sinking
at
wake
island
had
been
uneventful
since
they
had
run
submerged
most
of
the
time
during
daylight
hours
always
on
the
lookout
for
enemy
ships
officers
and
crew
alike
had
been
disappointed
to
run
into
nothing
but
an
american
task
force
consisting
of
a
carrier
a
cruiser
and
three
destroyers
racing
north
at
full
speed
march
had
tried
to
make
out
the
name
of
the
carrier
and
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
know
it
was
the
carrying
scoot
and
his
companions
from
their
truk
attack
to
a
small
action
against
another
island
farther
north
but
even
american
subs
submerged
and
ran
deep
and
quiet
when
american
ships
were
near
by
the
destroyers
would
have
started
to
toss
depth
charges
like
snowflakes
if
they
had
sighted
a
periscope
of
any
kind
at
the
sub
base

skippers
and
their
seconds
were
at
a
meeting
aboard
the
tender
captain
milbank
the
intelligence
officer
was
speaking
to
them
you
ve
all
heard
about
the
blasting
of
truk
he
said
now
it
s
certain
that
the
japs
will
try
to
reinforce
that
important
post
as
quickly
and
as
fully
as
possible
in
fact
word
has
reached
us
through
the
chinese
that
a
large
convoy
has
already
left
japan
for
truk
with
troops
oil
and
gasoline
ammunition
more
antiaircraft
guns
food
and
supplies
and
with
almost
every
deck
covered
with
zeros
they
ve
got
to
replace
what
we
knocked
out
there
and
even
further
increase
their
defending
force
they
know
we
ll
hit
it
he
looked
around
the
room
at
the
quiet
serious
faces
of
the
men
who
listened
intently
you
may
also
know
he
went
on
that
we
have
found
chinese
intelligence
to
be
very
reliable
it
s
amazing
how
they
get
word
through
the
jap
lines
so
quickly
and
efficiently
chinese
report
that
there
s
something
special
about
this
convoy
for
truk
they
weren
t
able
to
learn
exactly
what
it
is
but
they
believe
it
is
in
the
route
to
be
followed
the
nips
know
our
submarines
are
roaming
the
seas
out
here
and
will
be
on
the
lookout
especially
for
this
convoy
having
knocked
truk
half
out
we
want
to
keep
it
in
that
condition
it
s
you
some
help
i
must
confess
from
the
air
will
do
that
there
were
smiles
in
the
room
as
the
captain
joking
grudgingly
recognized
the
usefulness
of
the
flying
sailors
then
he
continued
our
patrol
planes
are
ranging
over
the
ocean
on
the
lookout
for
the
convoy
of
course
but
their
distances
are
limited
and
it
s
a
mighty
big
ocean
to
cover
so
for
a
while
our
submarines
must
also
act
as
scouts
later
we
can
get
together
and
sink
the
ships
but
first
we
have
to
act
as
a
team
to
find
them
we
re
all
going
to
leave
here
at
the
same
time
and
fan
out
to
cover
the
main
routes
from
japan
to
truk
and
we
want
to
catch
them
as
far
from
truk
as
possible
the
earlier
we
can
find
them
the
more
subs
and
planes
we
ll
have
time
to
get
to
the
attack
so
we
can
wipe
the
whole
thing
the
captain
turned
to
a
chart
behind
him
on
the
wall
later
i
shall
go
over
with
you
the
routes
to
be
followed
by
each
submarine
he
said
if
and
when
any
one
of
you
sights
the
convoy
he
is
to
radio
that
information
the
japs
would
certainly
pick
up
that
broadcast
they
d
know
we
had
discovered
them
and
they
d
be
ready
for
us
we
want
the
attack
to
come
by
surprise
so
we
have
arranged
certain
spots
for
each
of
you
to
arrive
at
on
certain
days
and
at
specific
hours
a
patrol
plane
will
visit
each
of
those
spots
clearly
marked
so
that
you
will
not
mistake
it
for
an
enemy
plane
he
will
land
on
the
water
and
pick
up
any
information
you
may
have
this
same
procedure
is
to
be
followed
hours
later
at
another
spot
further
away
if
by
that
time
not
one
of
you
has
found
the
convoy
you
are
to
go
your
own
ways
looking
for
whatever
you
can
find
on
this
patrol
and
by
that
time
if
you
find
anything
like
the
big
convoy
the
only
thing
to
do
will
be
to
surface
and
radio
us
so
we
can
all
close
in
for
the
kill
we
ll
lose
the
element
of
surprise
but
we
ll
get
them
next
the
intelligence
officer
went
over
the
details
of
routes
and
rendezvous
spots
for
each
submarine
march
saw
at
once
that
was
taking
a
westerly
course
from
their
base
then
heading
northwest
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
should
be
one
of
the
most
likely
routes
for
a
convoy
to
take
from
japan
to
truk
and
he
was
pleased
then
larry
gray
asked
a
question
of
the
intelligence
officer
those
rendezvous
spots
he
said
they
appear
to
be
in
open
sea
but
i
know
there
are
little
atolls
all
over
the
place
are
they
near
such
islands
no
they
are
not
the
captain
said
purposely
the
japs
have
little
garrisons
on
a
great
many
of
those
tiny
islands
that
look
no
more
than
bumps
on
the
sea
some
of
them
have
radios
if
they
saw
the
contact
of
an
american
sub
and
an
american
patrol
plane
so
far
from
our
bases
they
d
report
it
that
wouldn
t
tell
the
japs
much
but
the
less
they
know
the
better
we
like
it
no
matter
how
unimportant
it
may
seem
no
the
meeting
places
are
in
open
water
the
navigators
have
a
little
work
to
do
on
this
larry
glanced
at
march
and
smiled
march
knew
it
wasn
t
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
one
exact
spot
in
the
middle
of
a
big
ocean
by
dead
reckoning
after
going
over
all
details
of
the
complicated
plan
thoroughly
the
skipper
and
their
execs
returned
to
their
own
submarines
to
see
that
everything
was
ready
for
getting
under
way
fuel
and
supplies
and
torpedoes
had
been
loaded
into
all
the
pigboats
and
there
remained
only
a
final
check
before
they
could
depart
in
the
night
they
slipped
away
from
their
tender
one
by
one
and
traveling
on
the
surface
under
the
protection
of
night
they
headed
out
to
sea
silently
on
the
alert
eagerly
looking
forward
to
the
task
ahead
the
crew
of
each
pigboat
felt
that
would
be
the
ones
to
find
the
convoy
the
first
to
go
in
for
the
attack
but
on
the
second
day
not
a
sign
of
the
convoy
had
been
seen
by
any
of
the
submarines
must
be
coming
more
slowly
than
we
thought
larry
suggested
we
ll
catch
up
with
it
before
the
next
patrol
at
the
time
larry
spoke
they
were
on
the
surface
in
the
late
afternoon
watching
the
big
american
flying
boat
slide
down
out
of
the
clouds
and
circle
above
them
march
had
felt
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
when
he
saw
it
knowing
that
it
meant
he
had
found
his
particular
spot
in
the
wide
pacific
but
larry
just
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
his
navigator
would
have
brought
them
where
they
were
supposed
to
be
no
matter
how
difficult
the
job
they
gave
their
negative
report
to
the
patrol
learned
that
no
other
pigboat
contacted
had
had
better
luck
then
submerged
as
the
flying
boat
took
off
from
the
choppy
waters
they
ran
submerged
at
periscope
depth
for
two
hours
until
darkness
began
to
fall
with
one
of
the
officers
having
his
eye
glued
to
the
little
rubber
piece
on
the
scope
every
minute
then
they
surfaced
and
went
steadily
forward
on
their
prescribed
course
two
officers
and
three
lookouts
stayed
constantly
on
the
bridge
and
the
sound
detector
man
below
concentrated
on
his
listening
as
never
before
it
might
well
be
that
he
could
pick
up
the
sound
of
a
convoy
s
propellers
long
before
the
lookouts
would
sight
anything
especially
on
a
moonless
night
but
dawn
came
and
found
them
with
nothing
to
report
you
d
think
there
wasn
t
even
a
war
going
on
out
here
mcfee
complained
don
t
the
nips
have
ships
in
these
waters
not
in
the
waters
we
ve
been
sailing
on
anyway
stan
bigelow
replied
i
feel
from
looking
so
hard
for
the
last
four
the
bright
sun
sent
them
under
the
water
again
but
only
to
periscope
depth
so
that
a
constant
lookout
could
be
maintained
afternoon
found
them
filled
with
discouragement
waiting
for
the
patrol
plane
the
patrol
had
found
nothing
maybe
one
of
the
march
suggested
but
larry
shook
his
head
i
can
t
believe
it
he
said
i
think
we
re
in
the
best
spot
we
re
furthest
west
of
the
whole
bunch
that
s
certainly
the
most
likely
route
for
the
convoy
keeping
as
close
to
the
philippines
to
land
protection
as
possible
if
they
were
attacked
they
d
have
support
from
planes
there
for
quite
a
while
if
anything
i
think
they
may
even
be
further
west
than
our
march
and
larry
talked
as
they
stood
on
the
bridge
waiting
for
their
patrol
plane
to
come
out
of
the
west
suddenly
the
lookout
shouted
plane
coming
out
of
the
sun
can
t
be
ours
larry
shouted
rig
for
dive
as
march
barked
out
the
orders
to
take
the
ship
down
the
lookout
reported
that
the
plane
was
a
flying
boat
must
be
a
jap
all
right
larry
said
they
all
knew
that
their
own
plane
was
one
of
the
flying
boats
in
the
world
illustration
flying
boat
came
at
in
two
minutes
march
had
slid
down
the
hatch
to
be
followed
by
larry
who
dogged
the
hatch
cover
tight
take
her
down
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
he
said
turned
her
nose
down
and
slid
forward
as
they
leveled
off
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
they
heard
the
roar
and
felt
the
jar
of
a
depth
charge
explosion
but
it
was
not
close
and
it
went
off
far
above
them
then
came
another
a
little
closer
but
still
threatening
no
danger
to
the
sub
not
charges
larry
said
we
re
all
right
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
we
ll
just
wait
him
out
he
can
t
be
carrying
very
many
depth
charges
in
that
job
of
his
but
hold
ll
probably
get
a
little
they
all
held
on
but
nothing
happened
not
another
charge
went
off
march
looked
questioningly
at
larry
don
t
know
larry
said
maybe
he
s
gone
on
more
likely
he
s
playing
possum
hoping
we
ll
think
he
s
gone
and
will
come
up
for
a
look
that
s
when
he
d
get
better
stay
down
for
a
while
march
said
yes
he
can
t
fly
around
up
there
in
a
circle
forever
larry
said
we
ll
go
up
in
an
what
about
meeting
our
patrol
plane
march
asked
i
m
afraid
we
ll
miss
him
larry
said
can
t
take
a
chance
on
going
up
now
he
might
hang
around
for
a
while
of
course
if
the
jap
has
he
could
take
care
of
that
jap
in
a
minute
mcfee
said
say
maybe
that
s
what
happened
march
suggested
perhaps
said
larry
maybe
our
plane
came
and
drove
off
the
jap
but
we
can
t
be
sure
i
m
not
going
to
risk
a
sub
and
sixty
men
just
to
find
then
the
sound
man
turned
excitedly
i
hear
something
sir
he
said
something
in
like
a
hammer
tapping
against
metal
i
ll
have
it
in
a
they
waited
impatiently
as
the
sound
man
took
down
the
message
then
he
handed
it
to
larry
it
said
jap
went
home
come
on
larry
grinned
it
s
okay
he
said
the
jap
wouldn
t
have
known
we
were
it
s
our
plane
take
her
when
the
ship
surfaced
and
larry
scrambled
through
the
hatch
on
to
the
bridge
he
saw
the
big
american
flying
boat
resting
on
the
water
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
it
taxied
over
beside
the
submarine
as
march
and
mac
joined
larry
on
the
bridge
i
thought
you
d
get
that
message
the
plane
s
pilot
called
with
a
smile
nippo
just
took
one
look
at
me
coming
and
decided
he
had
a
date
west
of
here
in
a
big
larry
passed
on
his
report
of
not
having
sighted
the
big
jap
convoy
and
learned
that
no
other
submarine
had
found
it
either
well
you
re
on
your
own
now
the
pilot
said
go
get
em
and
good
they
waved
as
the
plane
turned
and
roared
over
the
water
lifted
in
the
air
and
circled
to
the
east
with
a
last
dip
of
its
wings
now
where
do
we
go
from
here
march
asked
we
ll
head
west
larry
said
after
that
jap
plane
let
s
get
going
i
m
going
to
find
that
convoy
meanwhile
the
jap
plane
heading
west
had
sighted
something
else
its
pilot
was
angry
at
having
been
driven
away
from
an
american
submarine
just
when
it
was
about
to
blow
the
hated
pigboat
to
its
ancestors
and
there
ahead
of
make
up
for
that
a
lone
american
fighter
plane
he
grinned
happily
american
plane
he
said
to
his
we
get
the
looked
worried
american
fighter
too
fast
for
slow
flying
boat
maybe
he
get
us
but
the
pilot
was
angry
and
not
to
be
argued
with
no
we
get
american
fighter
it
was
obvious
that
the
american
had
seen
them
but
the
plane
did
not
put
on
a
sudden
burst
of
speed
did
not
maneuver
quickly
to
get
into
position
for
the
attack
the
grinned
american
plane
damaged
he
said
american
plane
can
not
fly
fast
now
will
you
question
what
i
say
demanded
the
pilot
i
said
we
get
american
plane
our
gods
damage
plane
so
we
get
scoot
bailey
looked
at
the
approaching
jap
bomber
and
frowned
here
was
a
quick
decision
to
be
made
he
had
been
out
with
the
other
fighters
and
bombers
from
attacking
the
jap
garrison
on
a
small
island
to
the
north
a
lucky
shot
from
one
of
the
few
defending
jap
it
went
scoot
s
oil
line
there
was
a
leak
though
not
a
big
one
and
the
engine
was
heating
up
badly
so
scoot
had
been
separated
from
the
others
and
now
was
limping
home
to
his
carrier
trying
to
get
the
best
speed
he
could
without
overheating
the
engine
too
much
it
had
not
been
an
easy
job
to
nurse
it
along
that
way
for
the
oil
was
dripping
away
drop
by
drop
still
he
thought
he
might
make
it
for
he
had
only
about
forty
more
miles
to
go
and
now
this
clumsy
boat
of
the
japs
has
to
show
up
he
shouted
to
himself
angrily
i
could
take
him
in
a
minute
if
i
was
okay
but
with
this
leaky
oil
ll
i
do
if
i
give
her
the
gun
and
really
swoop
down
on
this
bird
i
ll
force
out
most
of
the
oil
that
i
ve
got
left
heat
up
the
engine
so
much
it
ll
burn
out
but
if
i
don
t
then
i
m
just
like
a
clay
pigeon
sitting
here
waiting
to
be
scoot
smiled
doesn
t
take
long
to
make
up
your
mind
in
a
case
like
that
i
ll
get
that
baby
who
thinks
i
m
crippled
and
can
t
fight
back
and
then
i
ll
just
be
setting
myself
down
on
the
sea
somewhere
and
hoping
to
be
picked
up
though
there
s
not
much
hope
for
that
he
let
the
jap
patrol
plane
come
on
continued
to
act
as
if
he
couldn
t
maneuver
the
plane
he
wiggled
the
wings
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
his
craft
do
something
it
wouldn
t
do
he
succeeded
in
filling
the
jap
pilot
with
such
confidence
that
the
man
was
happily
off
guard
then
at
the
last
minute
he
gave
his
hellcat
the
gun
and
she
almost
jumped
out
from
under
him
up
he
rose
then
did
a
and
swooped
down
on
the
jap
plane
from
above
and
behind
big
splashes
of
oil
were
covering
his
windshield
forced
from
the
leaky
line
by
the
sudden
rush
of
power
in
the
engine
the
jap
plane
was
just
a
blur
when
scoot
pressed
the
gun
button
and
heard
the
pounding
of
bullets
from
his
machine
guns
then
he
pulled
up
and
to
the
right
looking
out
the
side
yes
he
had
done
it
the
jap
bomber
was
afire
but
trying
to
turn
to
the
left
then
scoot
saw
what
he
was
aiming
tiny
reef
with
a
few
palm
trees
a
few
miles
to
the
south
suddenly
the
jap
plane
blew
up
in
the
air
with
a
roar
scoot
felt
the
shock
of
the
blast
and
watched
the
pieces
of
flaming
plane
plummet
to
the
sea
below
where
a
steaming
smoke
arose
from
the
water
scoot
s
smile
was
frozen
by
a
hard
hammering
knock
from
his
engine
that
did
it
he
exclaimed
she
s
conking
out
and
right
about
now
maybe
i
can
make
that
little
island
even
if
the
jap
couldn
he
edged
the
plane
around
with
the
last
gasps
from
the
engine
and
put
her
into
a
glide
toward
the
little
spot
of
land
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
be
japs
on
the
island
tiny
as
it
was
and
with
one
hand
he
checked
his
service
revolver
to
be
sure
that
he
might
take
a
few
with
him
before
he
went
himself
if
the
worst
should
happen
and
all
that
depends
on
whether
i
make
it
in
this
glide
or
not
scoot
said
but
it
looks
the
plane
was
slipping
down
the
sky
fast
approaching
the
island
about
ten
feet
above
the
water
scoot
leveled
her
off
and
pancaked
into
the
water
trying
to
get
his
tail
to
act
as
a
brake
the
controls
flew
from
his
hands
and
his
head
hit
the
top
of
his
cockpit
but
he
didn
t
lose
consciousness
from
the
blow
even
though
he
was
badly
stunned
he
saw
the
rocky
shore
of
the
island
rushing
toward
him
as
the
plane
seemed
to
skim
over
the
water
then
he
struck
the
rocks
was
thrown
forward
and
heard
a
ripping
tearing
sound
as
the
bottom
of
his
fuselage
was
crushed
and
mangled
on
the
rocks
he
felt
a
throb
in
his
forehead
and
realized
that
he
was
looking
at
the
slightly
twisted
floor
of
his
cockpit
must
have
been
knocked
out
for
a
minute
scoot
told
himself
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
around
his
plane
was
entirely
on
dry
land
it
had
skidded
over
the
rocks
leaving
the
water
right
in
front
of
him
was
the
smooth
slanting
trunk
of
a
palm
tree
he
saw
no
movement
anywhere
well
if
there
were
japs
here
they
d
have
been
on
top
of
me
long
before
scoot
unfastened
his
safety
belt
and
crawled
from
his
seat
feeling
his
bruised
arms
and
legs
to
make
sure
they
were
whole
in
another
moment
he
stood
on
the
rocky
shore
surveying
sadly
his
crumpled
and
twisted
ship
my
beautiful
hellcat
he
said
patting
her
side
look
what
i
ve
done
to
you
then
he
turned
and
looked
the
island
over
it
was
he
could
easily
see
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
long
and
fifty
feet
wide
and
it
curved
in
a
gentle
arc
there
were
rocks
a
few
palm
trees
some
low
bushes
and
nothing
else
well
i
might
as
well
like
it
scoot
said
it
may
be
my
home
for
the
duration
chapter
fifteen
find
the
convoy
march
and
larry
stood
over
the
navigation
table
and
looked
at
charts
we
re
just
about
here
now
march
said
pointing
to
a
spot
not
far
east
of
the
philippines
what
s
that
larry
asked
putting
his
finger
tip
on
a
tiny
dot
near
by
a
tiny
atoll
march
said
couple
of
hundred
yards
long
that
s
let
s
pull
into
the
lee
of
it
and
surface
larry
said
there
won
t
be
any
japs
on
something
that
small
we
can
charge
the
batteries
up
full
get
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
plan
our
campaign
from
here
on
right
march
agreed
we
ll
reach
it
in
about
an
hour
we
ve
gone
about
two
hours
since
the
patrol
plane
left
so
it
was
that
scoot
bailey
lying
at
the
edge
of
the
beach
not
far
from
his
wrecked
plane
which
he
had
covered
with
boughs
so
it
would
not
be
seen
by
jap
patrols
heard
a
rushing
of
water
a
little
way
from
shore
and
saw
a
huge
black
hull
appear
from
the
deep
not
a
hundred
feet
out
he
scrambled
behind
a
bush
quickly
and
peered
out
cautiously
though
it
was
so
dark
that
no
one
on
the
sub
could
possibly
have
seen
him
a
sub
he
exclaimed
but
the
question
or
american
he
tried
to
find
a
marking
that
would
tell
him
the
answer
to
his
question
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
then
he
made
out
figures
of
men
on
the
bridge
two
men
looking
around
one
said
something
to
the
other
but
so
low
that
he
could
not
make
out
the
language
one
of
the
men
took
up
a
lookout
position
if
it
s
a
jap
scoot
muttered
to
himself
i
d
hate
to
let
it
get
away
from
me
i
m
probably
not
in
any
danger
it
must
just
be
up
to
charge
batteries
they
wouldn
t
come
ashore
here
for
to
come
for
unless
some
of
the
men
just
want
to
plant
their
feet
on
solid
ground
for
a
change
even
then
i
can
he
thought
hard
seems
as
if
there
ought
to
be
something
i
could
do
though
one
grounded
flier
against
a
sub
is
kind
of
tough
he
was
so
busy
trying
to
think
what
he
could
do
to
sink
a
jap
submarine
that
he
convinced
himself
that
it
japanese
the
machine
guns
in
my
plane
he
exclaimed
suddenly
they
probably
still
work
if
i
can
get
at
them
the
plane
s
heading
the
wrong
way
or
i
could
just
shoot
them
as
is
but
maybe
i
can
get
one
or
two
then
he
wondered
if
bullets
could
possibly
sink
a
submarine
probably
not
he
told
himself
but
they
could
pick
off
quite
a
few
officers
and
men
and
then
if
the
rest
decided
to
come
and
get
me
i
d
get
quite
a
few
more
on
their
way
suddenly
the
diesels
on
the
submarine
roared
into
life
and
quickly
settled
down
to
a
steady
purr
charging
batteries
is
right
scoot
told
himself
that
s
just
enough
sound
to
keep
them
from
hearing
me
try
to
get
a
gun
out
of
my
plane
of
course
they
ve
probably
got
their
own
machine
gun
unlimbered
up
there
usually
do
when
they
re
surfaced
like
this
i
ll
see
what
i
can
scoot
crawled
over
to
his
plane
and
started
to
work
taking
off
the
engine
cowling
seemed
to
him
to
make
a
terrific
noise
and
he
stopped
to
listen
wondering
if
he
had
been
heard
the
sound
from
the
diesels
seemed
very
low
and
then
he
heard
that
made
his
heart
leap
me
back
to
old
virginnneee
sang
a
high
tenor
voice
the
lookout
was
indulging
in
his
favorite
sport
scoot
leaped
out
on
the
shore
yippeeee
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
on
the
bridge
of
the
submarine
march
whirled
around
at
the
sound
of
the
strange
cry
from
the
tiny
island
without
a
word
one
of
the
enlisted
men
had
leaped
to
the
machine
gun
and
now
he
poured
a
round
of
shots
at
the
shore
then
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
from
behind
a
palm
tree
came
a
voice
a
heart
scoot
cried
i
m
an
american
how
do
we
know
demanded
march
over
the
sound
of
the
diesels
he
would
like
to
have
shut
them
off
so
he
could
hear
better
but
he
wanted
to
keep
them
running
for
a
quick
getaway
in
case
there
was
any
sort
of
jap
force
on
that
tiny
atoll
the
sound
of
the
american
voice
sounded
genuine
but
you
could
never
be
sure
too
many
japs
who
had
lived
in
america
went
back
home
to
fight
in
jap
armies
they
spoke
english
fairly
well
some
of
them
and
they
had
used
it
to
trick
trusting
americans
too
many
times
by
this
time
larry
gray
had
scrambled
up
on
the
bridge
beside
march
who
quickly
explained
what
had
happened
stan
and
mac
joined
them
wondering
at
the
sound
of
fire
i
m
an
american
flier
scoot
shouted
back
crashed
here
this
turn
on
the
searchlight
larry
ordered
and
in
a
moment
the
powerful
beam
found
the
lone
figure
on
the
rocky
beach
only
one
man
march
said
and
it
sure
looks
like
a
navy
uniform
slightly
mussed
up
he
must
be
okay
can
t
ever
be
sure
larry
said
there
may
be
a
pack
of
japs
back
behind
those
trees
it
may
be
a
swiped
uniform
but
he
looks
white
and
tall
march
said
yes
he
does
larry
agreed
but
if
he
s
an
he
s
i
know
you
can
t
take
any
chances
on
a
trap
the
voice
came
to
them
over
the
water
you
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
ll
do
the
all
right
larry
called
back
we
re
sure
you
must
be
american
all
right
but
we
won
t
take
a
chance
take
your
clothes
off
and
swim
out
to
us
we
ll
keep
the
light
on
you
and
you
re
covered
at
every
minute
with
a
machine
on
shore
scoot
gulped
at
the
idea
of
the
machine
gun
pointing
at
him
every
minute
but
he
agreed
knowing
that
in
a
similar
situation
he
would
be
just
as
cautious
about
any
possible
jap
trick
he
quickly
stripped
to
his
underwear
leaving
his
clothes
on
the
rocks
at
his
feet
then
arms
in
the
air
so
the
men
on
the
sub
would
see
that
he
carried
nothing
he
waded
into
the
water
always
in
the
bright
spot
of
the
searchlight
when
the
water
came
up
to
his
chest
he
bent
forward
and
started
swimming
being
careful
to
raise
both
arms
well
out
of
the
water
at
each
stroke
but
he
had
to
keep
his
head
down
and
his
eyes
averted
because
of
the
bright
glare
of
the
light
soon
his
hand
struck
the
steel
side
of
the
hull
and
helping
arms
reached
down
to
pull
him
up
on
the
deck
two
enlisted
men
and
mcfee
were
there
looking
him
over
carefully
he
s
okay
skipper
mac
called
up
to
the
bridge
not
a
thing
on
him
and
he
s
as
american
as
uncle
then
to
scoot
how
are
you
fellow
glad
we
found
you
come
on
he
led
the
dripping
scoot
to
the
ladder
leading
up
to
the
bridge
as
he
climbed
over
the
edge
scoot
saw
a
familiar
almost
fell
over
backward
to
the
deck
again
march
he
yelled
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
scoot
bailey
march
cried
rushing
forward
he
threw
his
arms
around
the
shivering
and
wet
flier
and
pounded
him
on
the
back
scoot
my
boy
it
s
really
you
how
on
but
scoot
was
shouting
and
talking
too
laughing
and
dazed
by
the
many
things
that
had
happened
to
him
in
the
last
few
hours
mcfee
and
the
enlisted
men
looked
on
in
amazement
at
the
scene
but
larry
gray
was
smiling
he
remembered
the
name
of
scoot
bailey
from
the
many
things
march
had
told
him
about
his
closest
friend
and
he
had
seen
enough
strange
things
happen
in
the
war
not
to
be
too
startled
at
anything
that
happened
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
gone
below
and
scoot
was
wrapped
in
a
blanket
while
two
men
put
out
in
a
collapsible
boat
to
bring
his
clothes
from
the
island
scoot
sat
with
the
others
in
the
tiny
and
drank
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
while
they
talked
and
asked
questions
and
answered
them
illustration
pounded
scoot
on
the
soon
everyone
was
brought
up
to
date
on
the
most
important
things
that
had
been
happening
mcfee
and
stan
who
had
joined
them
knew
who
scoot
was
and
how
he
came
to
be
there
outside
word
went
scurrying
around
among
the
men
that
they
d
picked
up
a
navy
flier
that
it
had
turned
out
to
be
the
exec
s
oldest
and
best
friend
everybody
felt
happy
with
a
stroke
of
luck
like
that
pete
kalinsky
said
maybe
we
can
find
that
jap
convoy
march
told
scoot
about
their
search
for
the
convoy
their
encounter
with
the
jap
patrol
plane
that
very
afternoon
and
how
the
american
plane
had
chased
him
away
scoot
was
serious
right
away
aichi
flying
boat
he
asked
yes
why
march
asked
i
took
care
of
him
for
you
scoot
said
with
a
smile
he
try
to
my
friend
will
he
well
he
won
t
do
any
scoot
told
them
about
his
leaky
oil
line
his
encounter
with
the
jap
plane
shooting
it
down
and
then
making
the
tiny
island
in
a
glide
and
then
i
came
along
and
picked
you
up
march
laughed
with
only
a
few
hours
long
time
ago
scoot
said
you
told
me
you
d
probably
have
to
come
along
in
your
sub
and
save
me
from
a
bunch
of
japs
sure
i
remember
march
cried
didn
t
know
i
was
such
a
good
you
didn
t
save
me
from
any
japs
scoot
snorted
just
from
boredom
spending
the
rest
of
the
war
on
that
island
but
let
me
tell
you
another
don
t
know
how
close
you
came
to
getting
what
do
you
mean
larry
asked
i
mean
you
ought
to
pin
a
medal
on
whoever
it
is
in
your
crew
that
sings
carry
me
back
to
old
virginny
scoot
said
up
to
that
time
i
had
decided
you
were
japs
and
i
was
getting
a
machine
gun
out
of
my
you
mean
you
were
going
to
attack
us
demanded
stan
bigelow
didn
t
have
anybody
else
to
help
me
so
it
had
to
be
scoot
said
i
didn
t
think
i
could
sink
the
sub
but
i
thought
i
could
wait
till
a
lot
of
officers
and
men
were
on
deck
and
pick
off
most
of
now
that
s
the
spirit
i
like
larry
said
glad
to
have
you
along
on
this
trip
with
scoot
looked
startled
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
i
suppose
i
have
to
go
along
with
march
laughed
of
course
you
do
we
re
not
a
bus
service
we
re
out
looking
for
a
jap
convoy
and
we
can
t
very
well
take
time
to
run
you
back
to
your
base
or
carrier
before
going
well
so
i
m
a
submariner
after
all
scoot
said
nice
looking
boat
i
must
say
can
i
look
her
over
sure
from
stem
to
stern
larry
agreed
but
not
until
you
ve
eaten
something
i
imagine
that
island
didn
t
provide
you
with
much
of
a
dinner
the
cook
is
fixing
up
something
for
so
scoot
got
into
his
clothes
and
ate
a
delicious
meal
over
which
he
exclaimed
mightily
say
there
s
something
to
pigboat
service
anyway
he
said
i
thought
we
ate
pretty
well
on
the
but
this
is
fit
for
a
submarine
men
kings
march
said
and
for
once
scoot
would
not
argue
on
their
favorite
subject
of
the
past
soon
they
went
to
bed
except
for
those
on
watch
and
at
dawn
the
next
morning
proceeded
on
their
way
submerged
scoot
was
fascinated
at
the
diving
operation
and
looked
with
some
awe
on
march
as
he
carried
out
the
complicated
maneuver
it
was
only
then
that
he
learned
that
march
had
become
second
in
command
of
march
then
led
his
friend
on
a
tour
of
the
submarine
explaining
the
workings
of
all
the
complicated
machinery
introducing
him
to
the
crew
who
welcomed
him
warmly
not
bad
not
bad
scoot
said
i
begin
to
see
why
you
like
all
this
so
much
nice
small
crowd
here
all
getting
along
well
together
and
i
don
t
mind
the
idea
of
being
under
water
at
all
the
way
i
thought
i
scoot
and
march
and
larry
sat
down
in
the
wardroom
to
go
over
their
plans
you
see
larry
explained
i
have
a
hunch
the
japs
are
following
a
course
with
this
convoy
entirely
different
from
any
they
ve
followed
before
they
are
aware
that
we
know
they
ll
reinforce
truk
as
fast
as
possible
so
we
re
looking
for
them
to
take
a
direct
route
but
the
chinese
reported
that
there
was
something
strange
about
the
route
what
is
it
it
s
that
it
is
so
sounds
reasonable
scoot
agreed
well
they
don
t
want
to
take
forever
getting
there
however
larry
went
on
so
they
re
not
being
too
indirect
i
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
surprised
if
they
went
down
the
western
side
of
the
philippines
as
if
heading
for
or
burma
or
the
dutch
east
indies
then
they
might
cut
through
east
above
mindanao
the
lower
of
the
big
islands
in
the
philippines
after
that
they
d
make
a
fast
dash
straight
east
for
why
wouldn
t
we
catch
them
easily
there
march
asked
we
might
larry
explained
but
for
some
time
they
d
be
under
protection
of
planes
from
the
philippines
then
too
we
d
be
anxious
to
scout
them
out
as
early
as
possible
so
our
subs
would
be
farther
north
looking
along
the
more
direct
routes
they
d
have
a
chance
of
getting
through
without
a
scratch
but
anyway
they
d
not
have
far
to
go
after
we
sight
what
do
you
want
to
do
now
scoot
asked
i
m
heading
west
toward
the
philippines
trying
to
test
my
theory
larry
said
but
i
can
t
make
much
speed
having
to
run
submerged
in
the
daytime
i
m
afraid
they
may
be
out
in
the
clear
before
i
can
get
there
but
i
m
keeping
my
fingers
all
day
long
they
ran
submerged
keeping
a
constant
lookout
they
saw
a
jap
patrol
plane
and
dived
out
of
sight
before
he
got
near
them
but
there
was
no
sight
of
the
convoy
darkness
began
to
creep
over
the
ocean
and
they
were
getting
ready
to
surface
when
larry
at
the
periscope
saw
a
jap
seaplane
over
to
the
right
he
said
doesn
t
see
us
he
s
too
low
we
won
t
need
to
dive
unless
he
pulls
up
higher
again
s
coming
down
on
the
water
must
be
something
march
took
a
look
and
thought
he
saw
a
small
island
near
the
jap
plane
getting
too
dark
to
see
clearly
he
said
shall
we
go
over
and
have
a
look
skipper
yes
let
s
do
larry
said
i
m
curious
about
a
seaplane
here
that
s
the
kind
that
s
got
pontoons
and
is
usually
catapulted
from
a
battleship
or
cruiser
you
wouldn
t
expect
them
out
here
they
can
t
do
long
march
gave
the
order
to
change
course
and
they
stayed
under
the
water
as
they
neared
the
island
hope
there
s
still
enough
light
by
the
time
we
get
close
enough
to
have
a
good
look
larry
said
as
he
peered
through
the
periscope
good
thing
it
isn
t
overcast
today
or
we
couldn
t
see
a
thing
and
i
wouldn
t
want
to
hang
around
until
morning
just
for
a
look
at
what
might
turn
out
to
be
in
another
few
minutes
they
were
close
enough
to
see
and
larry
reported
to
the
others
that
a
small
boat
was
just
putting
off
from
the
seaplane
which
was
anchored
to
a
buoy
in
the
little
harbor
scoot
took
a
look
boy
those
periscopes
are
wonders
he
exclaimed
sharp
as
can
be
sure
i
know
the
ship
and
there
s
two
naval
fliers
in
the
dinghy
with
two
jap
soldiers
rowing
them
to
shore
a
whole
flock
of
soldiers
on
shore
wonder
what
it
s
all
as
march
and
the
others
had
a
look
larry
told
them
all
what
he
thought
this
latest
event
meant
seaplanes
come
from
battleships
or
cruisers
usually
he
said
i
think
this
plane
might
well
be
from
some
of
the
warships
protecting
the
convoy
headed
for
truk
the
japs
have
got
lookout
posts
on
a
lot
of
these
little
islands
plenty
more
than
usual
right
now
they
aren
t
trusting
to
radio
even
in
code
any
more
than
we
are
and
they
re
having
a
seaplane
or
two
go
out
ahead
of
the
convoy
to
pick
up
reports
from
their
garrisons
on
the
various
islands
this
is
the
plane
s
last
stop
for
the
night
in
the
morning
he
ll
go
back
to
his
ship
and
make
his
report
as
to
how
many
american
patrol
planes
or
subs
have
been
seen
in
the
area
by
these
the
others
thought
this
over
and
agreed
that
it
was
a
likely
hypothesis
then
scoot
asked
for
another
look
at
the
periscope
and
the
others
sensed
that
there
was
some
excitement
in
his
attitude
when
he
turned
away
from
the
scope
he
said
to
larry
can
i
talk
to
you
about
an
idea
i
ve
got
sure
come
into
the
wardroom
larry
said
with
an
eager
smile
come
along
they
sat
down
around
the
little
table
now
what
is
it
larry
asked
here
s
the
idea
scoot
said
i
know
that
about
it
they
made
us
study
those
things
though
i
couldn
t
see
the
point
of
it
at
the
time
it
usually
has
two
men
in
it
two
men
went
ashore
so
the
plane
s
unattended
i
m
going
to
swipe
it
swipe
it
larry
and
march
exclaimed
together
sure
scoot
said
if
you
can
surface
enough
to
let
me
when
it
s
good
and
ll
swim
to
it
get
in
cut
the
anchor
and
be
off
before
those
nips
know
what
s
going
then
what
will
you
do
larry
demanded
i
m
in
a
jap
seaplane
scoot
said
outposts
won
t
pay
any
attention
to
me
because
i
m
right
where
a
jap
seaplane
ought
to
be
flying
along
going
back
to
its
battleship
in
the
morning
nobody
will
question
me
by
radio
because
they
re
keeping
radio
all
this
is
assuming
that
my
hypothesis
is
correct
larry
said
i
think
it
is
scoot
said
at
least
it
s
what
a
hypothesis
good
basis
on
which
to
work
until
it
s
disproved
so
let
s
go
ahead
you
want
to
find
this
convoy
faster
than
your
sub
can
get
you
there
in
that
plane
i
can
find
it
in
a
it
s
you
certainly
can
larry
agreed
beginning
to
get
excited
about
scoot
s
idea
but
when
you
ve
found
then
get
word
to
you
somehow
scoot
said
now
let
s
i
ve
got
an
idea
march
said
scoot
sights
the
convoy
gets
a
line
on
its
size
and
direction
then
turns
around
and
heads
right
back
again
he
knows
our
exact
course
he
ll
come
down
on
that
course
at
a
spot
we
designate
we
ll
surface
and
pick
him
up
there
that
eliminates
all
radio
if
that
jap
plane
has
a
radio
and
scoot
can
get
it
on
our
and
use
it
and
if
he
did
we
d
have
to
be
traveling
on
the
surface
to
get
his
message
any
distance
away
and
we
d
better
not
do
that
too
sounds
okay
larry
said
but
what
happens
on
that
jap
convoy
when
they
see
their
seaplane
approach
look
around
and
then
head
back
again
won
t
they
think
that
s
mighty
funny
sure
they
will
scoot
said
and
i
can
t
quite
guess
what
they
ll
do
about
it
maybe
nothing
just
put
it
down
as
another
jap
pilot
gone
wacky
anyway
they
won
t
feel
there
s
any
danger
but
they
might
send
another
plane
up
to
have
a
look
and
see
what
s
wrong
i
d
just
hope
to
be
on
my
way
by
that
time
and
out
of
his
reach
anyway
that
s
one
of
the
chances
we
take
while
i
m
flying
there
i
can
get
the
jap
radio
in
shape
so
that
i
could
radio
a
message
to
you
if
i
saw
i
was
going
to
be
shot
down
you
could
surface
for
a
short
while
about
the
time
that
might
be
happening
so
you
d
get
any
well
larry
said
there
are
a
lot
of
in
this
whole
proposition
but
for
some
reason
i
like
what
s
the
gamble
scoot
demanded
you
larry
said
your
and
that
s
mighty
little
chance
for
the
navy
to
take
if
it
means
finding
this
convoy
early
enough
to
wipe
it
out
before
it
reaches
truk
if
the
idea
doesn
t
work
then
we
ve
just
been
wrong
and
missed
our
convoy
maybe
you
pick
me
up
safe
and
sound
as
planned
and
maybe
not
that
s
what
do
you
think
march
larry
asked
march
hesitated
think
it
s
worth
a
shot
if
scoot
thinks
he
can
get
that
plane
that
s
the
easiest
part
of
it
scoot
said
remember
what
a
good
swimmer
i
am
i
swam
to
get
to
the
sub
and
now
i
ll
swim
away
from
larry
gray
thought
for
a
while
before
making
up
his
mind
it
was
his
responsibility
this
decision
and
he
had
to
weigh
it
carefully
finally
he
spoke
all
right
we
ll
try
it
he
said
and
scoot
allowed
himself
a
mild
whoop
of
pleasure
here
s
the
plan
to
get
it
clear
we
surface
in
about
six
hours
when
everybody
except
a
sentry
or
two
will
be
asleep
scoot
is
ready
to
go
and
he
swims
to
the
plane
we
stay
up
just
long
enough
to
see
that
he
gets
away
then
we
dive
and
set
out
on
our
course
which
scoot
knows
he
flies
toward
the
passage
above
mindinao
where
i
think
the
convoy
might
be
if
he
doesn
t
sight
it
within
two
hours
flying
he
turns
around
and
flies
back
landing
on
the
sea
at
a
spot
agreed
on
in
advance
if
the
weather
s
bad
that
ll
be
tough
of
course
we
surface
for
a
while
riding
the
vents
and
ready
to
so
we
can
pick
up
scoot
if
he
s
even
near
the
designated
larry
paused
for
a
moment
and
the
others
remained
silent
if
scoot
sights
the
convoy
he
can
tell
fast
how
many
ships
what
speed
what
direction
he
heads
back
for
that
spot
on
the
ocean
as
planned
and
we
pick
him
up
if
the
japs
send
up
a
plane
or
planes
to
get
him
and
if
they
attack
him
he
ll
try
to
parachute
out
with
his
life
belt
or
get
his
plane
down
whole
or
something
so
he
can
be
picked
up
on
our
course
anyway
if
attacked
he
may
radio
us
about
the
convoy
first
if
he
s
been
able
to
get
the
plane
s
radio
what
do
we
do
march
asked
if
scoot
does
find
the
convoy
then
we
radio
larry
said
the
japs
may
hear
us
but
we
can
t
help
that
but
we
ll
go
on
in
to
the
attack
alone
we
ll
try
to
get
under
and
come
up
in
the
middle
of
the
convoy
so
as
to
scatter
it
in
time
for
the
other
subs
and
the
planes
that
will
be
coming
after
they
get
our
radio
all
clear
march
said
now
let
s
set
our
course
and
select
our
spot
for
picking
up
chapter
sixteen
downed
at
sea
not
a
sign
of
life
there
larry
said
as
he
looked
through
the
periscope
beach
fires
all
out
down
scope
take
her
they
moved
toward
the
ladder
leading
up
to
the
conning
tower
larry
first
scoot
immediately
behind
him
in
trunks
he
held
a
bundle
in
one
hand
hope
i
can
keep
these
clothes
a
little
dry
scoot
said
i
d
like
to
be
dressed
when
i
do
this
if
i
larry
unfastened
the
hatch
cover
and
hurried
up
on
to
the
bridge
scoot
was
behind
him
in
a
second
followed
by
march
and
two
enlisted
men
who
manned
the
machine
guns
at
once
everyone
moved
swiftly
and
noiselessly
scoot
was
already
sliding
down
the
ladder
to
the
deck
with
march
right
behind
him
larry
stayed
on
the
bridge
looking
sharply
toward
shore
at
every
minute
so
long
march
scoot
whispered
as
he
slid
into
the
water
i
ll
be
seeing
good
luck
scoot
march
whispered
back
and
that
was
all
for
just
a
second
he
watched
scoot
strike
out
toward
the
plane
holding
aloft
his
bundle
of
clothes
and
making
no
splashing
sound
then
march
turned
and
went
back
up
the
ladder
to
the
bridge
there
he
stood
quietly
beside
larry
who
said
nothing
march
picked
up
scoot
s
dim
figure
in
the
water
listening
at
the
same
time
for
the
sound
of
an
alarm
on
the
beach
in
case
a
sentry
saw
the
black
hull
of
the
submarine
offshore
he
s
reached
it
march
whispered
to
larry
must
be
unfastening
the
buoy
now
march
said
again
they
waited
in
silence
can
t
be
sure
but
i
think
he
s
climbing
up
on
the
pontoon
march
said
can
just
barely
make
him
out
can
t
be
seen
from
then
there
was
a
long
silence
tense
expectant
march
tried
to
picture
scoot
slipping
into
trousers
and
shirt
climbing
into
the
plane
s
cockpit
feeling
for
the
switches
and
controls
in
the
dark
he
d
probably
have
to
wind
up
the
starter
and
suddenly
at
this
moment
march
wondered
how
much
gas
the
jap
plane
had
in
it
must
be
enough
for
it
to
get
back
to
its
battleship
he
told
himself
march
jumped
a
coughing
roar
split
the
silence
and
the
darkness
flashes
of
flame
came
from
the
exhaust
pipes
of
the
plane
as
the
engine
roared
subsided
roared
again
scoot
had
taken
just
half
a
minute
to
warm
it
up
then
he
gave
it
the
gun
and
march
saw
the
plane
begin
to
move
down
men
larry
shouted
and
the
two
men
left
their
guns
and
slid
down
the
hatch
get
on
down
march
larry
said
and
take
her
down
i
m
right
behind
but
at
that
moment
shots
rang
out
from
the
shore
figures
were
running
along
the
beach
shouting
and
gesticulating
wildly
the
seaplane
was
roaring
away
over
the
water
and
some
men
were
firing
at
it
march
his
feet
on
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
looked
up
startled
and
then
larry
fell
at
his
feet
i
m
hit
march
larry
said
don
t
waste
a
minute
i
can
get
down
grabbing
his
skipper
march
hauled
him
to
the
companionway
he
heard
the
spatter
of
bullets
against
the
sides
of
the
submarine
he
lowered
larry
quickly
down
the
hatch
and
men
below
grabbed
him
and
helped
him
from
the
ladder
march
slid
down
after
him
shouting
commands
to
take
her
down
while
he
was
still
closing
the
hatch
call
sallini
he
said
to
one
of
the
men
take
the
skipper
to
his
quarters
mac
go
in
with
the
roar
of
water
into
the
ballast
tanks
flowed
over
them
and
the
whine
of
the
electric
motors
told
them
the
ship
was
under
way
steady
at
fifty
he
said
hold
course
we
ll
surface
in
a
little
while
stan
will
you
take
over
here
i
want
to
see
how
the
skipper
sure
march
stan
said
pat
him
on
the
back
for
me
hope
it
s
not
march
stood
at
the
door
of
gray
s
quarters
there
was
not
room
inside
larry
was
on
his
bunk
looking
up
to
smile
with
an
effort
but
with
pain
marking
his
face
this
was
one
we
didn
t
think
of
wasn
t
it
march
he
asked
how
are
you
larry
march
asked
it
hurts
like
the
devil
the
skipper
replied
i
think
there
s
two
or
three
slugs
in
my
chest
somewhere
sallini
will
be
able
to
tell
in
a
the
pharmacist
was
ripping
off
gray
s
shirt
and
undershirt
which
showed
spreading
stains
of
blood
mcfee
helped
him
trying
to
move
gray
as
little
as
possible
then
sallini
examined
the
wounds
carefully
for
a
few
moments
three
s
right
skipper
he
said
and
they
re
still
in
you
i
don
t
see
how
this
one
missed
the
heart
but
it
must
have
or
you
wouldn
t
be
talking
now
this
one
up
here
busted
your
that
s
what
hurts
so
much
right
now
and
the
other
on
the
right
side
must
ve
gone
right
through
the
lung
i
can
t
tell
if
any
might
be
lodged
in
the
spine
or
not
doubt
it
or
you
d
have
passed
t
move
can
t
move
much
anyway
the
skipper
replied
weakly
march
saw
that
his
face
was
draining
white
and
his
eyes
began
to
cloud
over
sulfa
tablets
anyway
sallini
said
and
bandages
to
stop
the
bleeding
here
though
there
s
not
much
likely
to
come
out
while
he
s
lying
down
may
be
some
internal
bleeding
but
i
couldn
t
do
anything
about
that
don
t
know
what
else
i
could
do
right
okay
sallini
march
said
go
get
what
you
need
and
do
it
as
fast
as
you
the
pharmacist
left
and
march
stepped
close
to
the
skipper
leaning
down
close
to
him
as
mac
was
march
gray
said
i
don
t
know
what
the
devil
this
is
but
i
feel
like
passing
out
this
is
an
order
from
your
out
plans
exactly
as
we
have
laid
them
out
you
re
in
command
of
this
submarine
when
i
incapacitated
mcfee
will
help
you
carry
on
go
get
that
convoy
we
ll
get
it
larry
march
said
but
you
ll
do
the
job
because
you
ll
be
up
and
around
by
the
time
we
get
there
or
at
least
you
can
direct
the
battle
from
your
gray
smiled
and
let
his
head
fall
back
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
then
sallini
reappeared
and
mac
and
march
stepped
to
the
companionway
and
watched
through
the
door
while
the
pharmacist
did
what
he
could
for
gray
the
skipper
was
unconscious
and
they
had
done
all
they
could
march
with
a
heavy
heart
stepped
back
into
the
control
room
and
took
the
interphone
from
the
orderly
the
skipper
s
been
wounded
he
said
to
the
entire
ship
i
know
that
makes
you
all
feel
just
as
badly
as
i
feel
right
now
sallini
s
done
all
he
can
for
him
and
he
s
resting
can
t
tell
much
about
his
condition
but
i
ll
let
you
know
regularly
how
he
then
he
gave
the
order
to
surface
the
boat
and
they
went
ahead
on
course
in
the
darkness
march
stood
his
watch
on
the
bridge
looking
ahead
in
the
blackness
wondering
how
scoot
was
making
out
up
there
and
how
the
skipper
was
making
out
in
his
own
blackness
down
below
sallini
had
given
larry
some
blood
plasma
to
overcome
some
of
the
loss
of
blood
that
the
skipper
had
suffered
but
gray
was
still
unconscious
when
march
went
below
as
stan
came
to
relieve
him
he
found
sallini
worried
his
fever
s
going
up
he
said
i
ve
just
given
him
more
sulfa
don
t
know
what
it
can
be
but
there
s
infection
somewhere
wish
i
could
get
those
slugs
out
of
him
but
that
s
a
ticklish
we
ll
wait
and
see
march
said
maybe
the
sulfa
will
lick
the
infection
and
the
fever
will
come
down
if
we
ll
decide
then
what
to
do
meanwhile
get
some
sleep
you
ve
been
up
all
march
lay
down
on
his
bunk
for
a
while
and
managed
to
drift
off
to
sleep
for
three
hours
just
as
dawn
was
breaking
he
got
up
and
had
a
cup
of
coffee
had
the
boat
submerged
to
periscope
depth
and
traveled
ahead
more
slowly
checking
regularly
to
make
sure
he
was
exactly
on
the
course
he
had
agreed
on
with
scoot
illustration
skipper
was
still
i
wonder
how
scoot
s
making
out
he
said
he
might
be
pretty
near
that
convoy
there
s
a
convoy
scoot
was
at
that
moment
disgusted
he
had
been
able
to
do
nothing
with
the
jap
plane
s
radio
during
all
these
hours
and
now
even
with
more
light
to
see
by
he
could
not
get
it
working
maybe
when
the
japs
order
radio
silence
he
told
himself
they
enforce
it
by
gumming
up
the
radio
some
way
so
it
be
used
anyway
i
can
t
do
anything
with
this
baby
i
m
going
to
be
keeping
radio
silence
whether
i
want
to
or
so
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
sea
ahead
of
him
where
he
hoped
to
sight
the
convoy
looking
at
the
chart
occasionally
and
checking
his
speed
he
calculated
where
he
must
be
then
he
saw
it
first
a
few
clouds
of
smoke
far
ahead
on
the
horizon
then
little
dots
below
the
that
were
jap
ships
more
and
more
and
more
of
them
he
saw
line
after
line
in
orderly
procession
up
ahead
and
at
the
sides
were
destroyers
and
near
the
front
a
two
battleships
as
he
flew
on
further
he
made
out
a
carrier
in
the
center
and
at
the
end
three
cruisers
and
more
destroyers
kept
a
rear
guard
don
t
want
to
get
any
closer
than
i
have
to
scoot
spoke
aloud
to
himself
but
i
want
to
get
all
the
dope
i
can
and
as
accurately
as
possible
got
to
stick
around
long
enough
to
check
their
speed
and
he
flew
on
counting
checking
making
another
estimate
to
compare
with
his
first
about
ships
he
said
to
himself
eight
miles
long
three
miles
wide
pretty
must
be
some
old
freighters
in
there
about
ten
he
grabbed
a
chart
and
quickly
plotted
the
convoy
s
course
wrote
brief
notations
of
his
conclusions
tucked
the
paper
into
a
waterproof
pouch
and
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
won
t
trust
to
memory
anyway
he
said
then
feeling
that
he
had
learned
all
he
could
he
banked
the
plane
and
turned
away
still
about
two
miles
ahead
of
the
leading
ships
he
looked
back
down
at
them
as
he
headed
eastward
once
more
right
now
they
re
wondering
what
s
going
on
he
said
to
himself
up
to
now
they
haven
t
thought
a
thing
they
saw
the
plane
coming
in
and
just
thought
it
was
a
little
earlier
than
they
had
expected
that
maybe
made
them
wonder
if
i
had
some
special
report
but
now
they
really
are
in
a
dither
they
just
can
t
figure
out
why
i
should
come
so
close
and
then
turn
he
laughed
well
that
s
their
problem
not
he
gave
the
little
plane
all
the
speed
he
could
if
they
were
going
to
send
up
a
plane
to
have
a
look
at
him
he
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
they
might
send
up
several
planes
if
they
re
fast
then
i
m
sunk
scoot
said
but
why
should
they
send
up
a
flock
of
planes
to
look
at
one
jap
seaplane
that
acts
a
little
funny
he
checked
his
course
often
so
that
he
could
land
where
the
submarine
could
pick
him
up
and
he
kept
looking
behind
for
the
jap
plane
that
might
be
coming
after
him
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
that
half
an
hour
away
from
the
convoy
he
saw
the
fast
little
pursuit
ship
behind
him
coming
like
the
wind
he
wished
his
own
plane
could
travel
twice
as
fast
but
he
could
not
urge
another
mile
per
hour
from
it
gradually
the
gap
closed
between
the
two
planes
now
what
scoot
asked
himself
what
should
i
do
i
ll
keep
right
on
this
course
first
of
all
and
i
ll
just
keep
flying
straight
ahead
as
if
i
were
minding
my
own
business
nothing
much
else
i
do
that
plane
s
got
three
times
the
speed
and
ten
times
the
fire
power
of
this
one
the
pursuit
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
behind
it
stayed
there
for
a
while
apparently
awaiting
some
kind
of
signal
from
the
seaplane
then
it
came
around
to
one
side
and
scoot
tried
to
hide
his
face
first
and
only
time
i
ever
wished
i
looked
like
a
jap
scoot
said
the
fast
plane
flew
alongside
the
other
for
a
time
slowing
down
to
keep
pace
with
it
but
still
some
distance
to
one
side
what
is
this
scoot
asked
are
we
just
going
out
for
a
spin
together
i
wish
he
d
do
the
jap
flier
obliged
by
cutting
back
and
coming
up
on
the
other
side
then
speeding
up
and
circling
around
in
front
it
was
at
this
moment
that
he
looked
full
into
scoot
s
face
scoot
could
even
see
the
alarm
that
filled
him
the
wide
eyes
the
gasp
of
amazement
as
he
realized
that
an
american
was
flying
the
jap
seaplane
at
that
moment
scoot
pressed
the
trigger
on
his
own
machine
gun
but
it
was
too
late
the
jap
had
darted
out
of
range
just
in
time
he
was
so
fast
that
scoot
could
not
possibly
maneuver
his
slow
ship
to
battle
him
there
s
only
one
chance
scoot
said
to
himself
and
i
m
going
to
try
it
if
this
monkey
is
the
bad
shot
most
of
them
are
he
may
miss
on
his
first
try
even
with
a
like
me
if
he
does
that
s
my
the
fast
pursuit
was
diving
on
the
seaplane
s
tail
scoot
heard
the
staccato
rattling
of
the
ship
s
machine
guns
good
he
cried
firing
while
he
s
still
too
far
away
like
all
of
them
too
anxious
but
then
scoot
s
plane
wobbled
tipped
over
and
went
spiraling
down
to
the
sea
in
a
slow
spin
the
pursuit
plane
circled
above
and
watched
about
fifty
feet
above
the
water
the
seaplane
lurched
a
little
seemed
to
come
out
of
its
spin
the
pursuit
plane
pilot
looked
puzzled
but
he
smiled
again
as
he
saw
the
plane
stall
slip
back
and
hit
the
sea
tail
first
chapter
seventeen
attack
it
was
the
cold
water
that
brought
scoot
to
his
senses
cold
water
creeping
up
over
his
chest
when
he
felt
it
he
scrambled
forward
but
fell
back
in
his
seat
at
once
the
arm
he
had
reached
out
to
pull
himself
up
with
would
not
work
it
hung
limp
at
his
side
he
glanced
down
and
saw
blood
streaming
from
it
got
to
do
something
about
that
he
muttered
dazedly
anyway
it
worked
he
thought
he
hit
me
i
did
a
nice
slow
spinning
dive
he
thought
he
d
got
the
pilot
and
the
plane
just
went
out
of
control
fell
into
a
natural
slow
spin
and
did
i
keep
it
slow
he
must
have
thought
it
was
funny
when
i
pulled
out
of
it
just
over
the
water
but
i
didn
t
make
it
look
too
good
couldn
t
but
i
d
slowed
her
down
plenty
then
put
her
into
a
stall
and
let
her
flop
back
tail
the
water
was
creeping
higher
as
scoot
sat
there
thinking
of
what
had
just
happened
then
he
shook
himself
to
clear
his
head
reached
up
with
his
good
arm
and
pulled
himself
forward
the
door
of
the
cockpit
was
already
wrenched
half
off
so
scoot
crawled
out
easily
enough
but
then
he
slipped
and
fell
into
the
water
the
shock
revived
him
a
little
more
so
that
he
grabbed
one
pontoon
slowly
and
painfully
he
pulled
himself
up
on
it
then
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
far
to
the
west
he
saw
the
dot
that
was
the
jap
pursuit
ship
heading
back
to
its
convoy
scoot
smiled
weakly
he
thinks
he
s
killed
an
american
flier
he
mumbled
he
doesn
t
know
how
hard
that
is
to
the
plane
was
not
sinking
any
further
its
tail
and
most
of
the
fuselage
were
covered
but
the
nose
and
wings
and
pontoons
were
above
the
surface
only
one
pontoon
busted
scoot
told
himself
the
other
s
holding
us
and
the
wing
tanks
that
are
almost
then
he
saw
his
broken
arm
again
he
had
to
stop
that
flow
of
blood
he
wriggled
forward
a
little
on
the
sloping
pontoon
so
that
he
could
wrap
his
legs
around
the
brace
leading
from
it
to
the
plane
s
fuselage
then
he
used
his
good
left
arm
to
rip
off
most
of
one
side
of
his
shirt
holding
one
end
of
the
strip
in
his
teeth
he
wound
the
cloth
around
the
bad
arm
above
the
break
making
it
as
tight
as
he
could
it
slipped
a
little
as
he
tied
it
but
it
was
fairly
tight
the
flow
of
blood
did
not
stop
but
it
was
greatly
reduced
don
t
know
how
much
longer
i
can
keep
my
strength
he
said
to
himself
better
make
myself
fast
illustration
tied
himself
to
the
slowly
he
struggled
out
of
his
trousers
after
taking
the
waterproof
pouch
with
the
convoy
information
and
putting
it
in
his
money
belt
next
he
tied
himself
to
the
strut
with
the
legs
of
his
trousers
then
he
sat
looking
eastward
in
the
direction
from
which
must
come
i
m
not
quite
as
far
as
i
ought
to
be
he
thought
feeling
consciousness
leaving
him
they
ll
probably
go
right
under
it
was
there
that
march
found
him
he
had
brought
to
the
surface
a
short
distance
before
the
spot
agreed
upon
for
the
meeting
but
there
had
been
no
sign
of
scoot
keeping
steadily
ahead
on
course
march
had
ordered
all
men
to
stay
below
at
their
stations
except
for
himself
and
the
controlman
on
the
bridge
they
were
riding
the
vents
with
main
ballast
tanks
open
and
air
vents
at
the
top
closed
the
water
rushed
in
to
fill
part
of
the
tanks
but
not
all
of
them
because
of
the
air
trapped
inside
that
still
allowed
enough
buoyancy
to
keep
on
the
surface
but
not
at
full
speed
all
that
was
needed
for
a
dive
was
the
opening
of
the
air
vents
at
the
top
of
the
ballast
tanks
that
might
save
twenty
seconds
in
the
diving
operations
and
twenty
seconds
might
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
march
had
looked
frantically
over
the
sea
when
they
reached
the
designated
spot
still
no
sign
of
scoot
and
no
report
from
the
radio
something
happened
he
muttered
to
himself
something
happened
so
he
continued
on
the
after
mile
beyond
the
assigned
spot
in
danger
every
minute
from
enemy
planes
that
might
sight
him
still
no
word
over
the
radio
he
was
just
about
to
give
up
and
order
the
ship
to
submerge
when
he
saw
the
dot
on
the
sea
ahead
he
was
ready
for
a
dive
at
any
it
might
be
scoot
instead
of
an
enemy
craft
so
he
stayed
on
the
surface
and
looked
looked
looked
as
they
came
nearer
then
he
saw
it
was
a
plane
crashed
in
a
crazy
position
he
ordered
main
ballasts
pumped
and
full
speed
ahead
next
he
ordered
men
up
to
man
the
guns
in
case
this
should
prove
some
trick
of
the
enemy
s
but
long
before
they
reached
the
plane
they
knew
what
it
was
when
they
were
still
some
distance
away
they
saw
the
figure
on
one
of
the
pontoons
as
they
neared
the
plane
men
were
ready
with
a
collapsible
boat
quickly
they
rowed
to
the
plane
lifted
scoot
into
the
rocking
boat
and
took
him
back
to
the
submarine
lifting
him
up
to
the
conning
tower
they
heard
him
mumble
something
he
reached
the
bridge
just
in
time
to
have
march
lean
close
to
his
lips
and
hear
money
in
another
minute
scoot
was
below
in
march
s
bunk
and
sallini
was
hovering
over
him
and
march
was
looking
at
the
chart
and
the
information
about
the
big
jap
convoy
he
rushed
to
the
interphone
we
ve
found
it
he
called
to
all
hands
scoot
bailey
found
it
we
re
radioing
headquarters
then
going
in
to
there
was
a
whoop
of
joy
throughout
the
ship
this
was
what
they
came
out
in
pigboats
find
a
flock
of
jap
ships
and
send
them
to
the
bottom
quickly
march
gave
details
in
code
to
scotty
at
the
radio
and
soon
the
message
was
flashing
out
over
the
water
in
a
moment
there
would
be
action
on
submarines
at
airfields
in
navy
bases
to
the
south
and
east
where
the
americans
were
waiting
for
just
this
news
then
march
took
the
ship
down
and
they
moved
forward
on
a
new
course
planned
to
bring
them
to
the
convoy
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
march
figured
it
would
take
about
two
hours
by
that
time
other
ships
and
subs
would
be
on
their
way
and
planes
would
be
roaring
overhead
soon
after
he
reached
the
jap
ships
he
went
in
to
scoot
and
found
sallini
smiling
he
ll
be
fine
the
pharmacist
said
broken
right
arm
bad
jagged
cut
severing
the
artery
but
we
ve
got
the
blood
flow
stopped
now
got
the
wound
clean
and
dressed
he
s
had
some
blood
plasma
and
i
ll
keep
giving
him
more
as
long
as
he
needs
it
he
lost
plenty
of
blood
but
he
ll
be
okay
nothing
besides
the
arm
march
asked
just
some
cuts
around
the
head
and
one
leg
sallini
said
nothing
serious
and
exhaustion
too
but
we
can
pull
him
out
of
that
fast
he
ought
to
be
talking
in
a
few
hours
and
walking
in
a
few
how
s
the
skipper
march
asked
still
unconscious
fever
high
but
receding
a
little
bit
maybe
he
ll
make
here
i
am
going
into
battle
with
my
skipper
and
my
best
friend
out
cold
march
exclaimed
you
ve
got
the
whole
crew
with
you
sir
the
pharmacist
said
every
man
of
em
let
s
get
in
the
middle
of
that
bunch
of
jap
ships
and
blast
the
daylights
out
of
em
tension
began
to
rise
in
the
boat
as
they
neared
the
convoy
traveling
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
where
no
shadow
of
a
sub
would
be
likely
to
be
seen
from
the
air
march
got
on
the
phone
and
told
all
hands
the
plan
of
attack
not
minimizing
the
dangers
we
re
going
into
the
middle
march
said
alone
it
was
the
skipper
s
plan
we
ll
be
the
first
there
and
we
re
to
scatter
them
so
the
planes
will
find
easy
pickings
and
the
other
subs
can
pick
them
off
as
they
scamper
away
we
ll
have
all
tubes
ready
to
go
at
just
about
the
same
fore
and
four
aft
then
we
ll
duck
for
all
we
re
worth
and
we
ll
go
mighty
deep
and
lay
there
was
another
shout
through
the
ship
and
the
men
stood
eagerly
at
their
posts
and
then
came
waiting
tense
waiting
as
the
ship
moved
forward
men
had
a
cup
of
coffee
smoked
a
cigarette
walked
back
and
forth
nervously
but
they
did
little
talking
they
were
waiting
listening
finally
the
sound
man
picked
up
something
propellers
he
said
plenty
of
degrees
to
take
her
to
two
hundred
feet
march
ordered
and
then
gave
a
slight
change
in
course
to
the
helmsman
we
ll
get
right
in
their
path
and
lay
low
without
motors
running
the
sound
detectors
on
the
advance
destroyers
won
t
catch
us
then
when
they
ve
passed
over
we
can
pick
up
motors
again
because
their
own
propellers
will
kill
all
the
sound
ours
make
we
ll
come
up
in
about
the
middle
pick
our
spot
and
let
go
i
ll
want
the
periscope
up
for
just
about
five
the
boat
leveled
off
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
motors
were
shut
off
soon
the
sound
man
reported
the
close
approach
of
the
propellers
march
had
judged
were
passing
overhead
destroyer
a
little
to
starboard
passing
over
the
soundman
reported
another
to
port
he
reported
in
a
moment
then
a
little
later
boy
wouldn
t
it
be
nice
to
get
that
murmured
one
of
the
men
nice
yes
march
replied
but
that
wouldn
t
do
the
job
for
the
other
boys
that
we
re
going
to
do
we
ll
let
one
of
the
forts
get
that
battleship
we
ll
just
send
it
the
men
nodded
in
agreement
they
knew
the
skipper
s
plan
was
best
ship
after
ship
passed
over
as
there
was
silence
in
the
submarine
then
march
spoke
come
up
to
feet
now
they
can
t
the
motors
whined
again
and
the
sub
tilted
up
slightly
everyone
watched
the
depth
hand
move
to
and
stay
there
the
sound
man
continued
to
report
propellers
overhead
march
figured
that
they
must
be
getting
near
the
center
of
the
convoy
say
here
s
something
the
sound
man
exclaimed
there
was
complete
silence
as
he
listened
more
intently
that
s
a
carrier
or
i
m
a
monkey
this
is
our
spot
march
said
quietly
then
he
spoke
over
the
phone
to
the
entire
ship
we
ve
found
our
spot
right
by
a
there
were
a
few
cries
of
pleasure
but
most
of
the
men
were
too
excited
to
shout
march
gave
the
order
to
bring
the
boat
up
to
periscope
depth
standing
by
the
shaft
ready
to
grab
it
as
the
ship
leveled
off
he
cried
up
scope
and
the
big
shaft
slid
upward
march
grabbed
the
handles
and
had
his
eyes
in
place
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
all
the
others
watched
him
intently
he
swung
the
scope
a
little
to
the
left
then
to
the
right
his
voice
came
sharply
then
giving
the
target
setting
for
the
forward
six
of
them
the
men
knew
that
was
for
the
carrier
then
march
swung
the
scope
clear
around
a
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
and
focused
troopship
he
called
and
then
gave
the
target
setting
to
be
relayed
to
the
after
torpedo
room
down
scope
he
called
stand
by
to
fire
the
shaft
slid
down
everyone
in
the
boat
knew
that
the
periscope
might
have
been
seen
even
in
those
few
seconds
it
was
up
even
though
most
lookouts
on
the
convoy
were
keeping
their
eyes
chiefly
on
the
seas
beyond
the
group
of
ships
the
sound
man
would
know
if
a
destroyer
came
racing
toward
them
but
march
was
not
going
to
wait
fire
one
mcfee
pressed
the
button
that
fired
number
one
torpedo
fire
two
the
second
one
shot
from
the
bow
fire
three
fire
four
fire
five
fire
six
in
rapid
order
the
commands
came
then
everyone
waited
tensely
march
looked
at
his
watch
counting
off
the
seconds
then
it
roar
the
shock
of
an
explosion
and
the
mighty
cheer
that
tore
through
the
throats
of
every
man
on
the
first
torpedo
had
struck
home
but
at
that
moment
march
called
out
fire
seven
fire
eight
fire
nine
fire
ten
and
during
those
commands
the
men
heard
further
explosions
from
the
first
torps
that
had
gone
streaking
out
march
had
not
been
able
to
count
how
many
had
come
but
he
knew
that
mcfee
had
done
so
but
now
all
were
waiting
for
the
first
sounds
from
the
aft
tubes
in
a
moment
it
first
torpedo
against
the
troopship
and
march
waited
no
longer
take
her
down
he
cried
three
hundred
feet
chapter
eighteen
depth
charges
three
hundred
feet
was
just
about
the
limit
for
them
pressure
was
terrific
at
that
level
they
all
knew
but
they
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
depth
charges
to
come
as
they
could
motors
whined
at
high
pitch
as
they
sent
the
boat
angling
down
toward
the
bottom
as
they
went
down
march
got
the
report
that
five
torpedoes
had
hit
the
carrier
and
all
four
had
ploughed
into
the
troopship
it
was
hard
to
concentrate
said
mcfee
but
i
know
i
m
right
and
brother
that
s
good
wish
we
could
know
just
how
much
damage
we
did
march
said
but
you
don
t
want
to
know
badly
enough
to
surface
and
find
out
do
you
asked
mac
with
a
grin
the
planes
will
find
out
when
they
come
along
in
a
few
minutes
they
ll
tell
just
what
we
did
anyway
the
sound
man
reports
that
the
ships
are
scattering
in
so
many
directions
he
can
t
keep
track
of
then
march
heard
something
else
from
the
sound
man
sounds
as
if
there
s
solid
rock
below
about
two
hundred
eighty
wonderful
cried
march
settle
down
to
it
and
we
ll
just
lie
there
and
rest
shut
off
all
motors
then
let
them
try
to
find
destroyers
coming
in
up
above
sir
the
sound
man
said
pretty
slow
weren
t
they
mac
commented
march
picked
up
the
phone
from
the
orderly
and
spoke
to
the
ship
they
ll
be
coming
any
minute
now
hold
fast
and
we
ll
be
snug
on
the
the
first
depth
charge
came
far
above
them
and
the
shock
from
it
was
very
slight
but
then
the
submarine
bumped
slightly
as
its
keel
settled
gently
against
the
bottom
motors
were
shut
off
and
tilted
a
little
to
one
side
as
it
lay
down
on
the
sloping
shelf
of
rock
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
came
the
metallic
click
and
then
the
monstrous
of
a
depth
charge
to
the
right
and
above
them
then
one
to
the
left
then
one
beyond
the
bow
then
one
beyond
the
stern
laying
a
nice
pattern
mcfee
called
as
he
held
fast
to
the
little
railing
at
the
periscope
well
that
would
get
us
if
we
were
higher
march
said
they
probably
figured
we
re
at
about
two
hundred
they
don
t
dare
go
any
lower
in
their
subs
usually
mcfee
said
as
he
braced
himself
for
the
next
series
of
charges
which
shook
him
march
looked
around
the
control
room
everyone
was
holding
fast
but
looking
very
calm
he
phoned
forward
to
the
torpedo
room
to
ask
how
everything
was
up
there
all
fine
sir
reported
pete
kalinsky
and
nice
shootin
room
after
room
reported
everything
all
right
just
a
light
filament
busted
from
that
last
one
in
here
said
the
machinist
s
mate
from
the
engine
room
march
saw
that
one
of
the
men
at
the
controls
was
steadying
another
while
he
lighted
a
cigarette
he
smiled
and
then
looked
up
sharply
as
a
figure
appeared
in
the
door
at
the
forward
bulkhead
it
was
scoot
hanging
on
groggily
and
looking
angry
what
s
goin
on
here
anyway
he
demanded
loudly
can
t
a
guy
sleep
in
peace
march
ran
to
him
but
a
depth
closest
him
sprawling
to
the
floor
mcfee
picked
him
up
holding
fast
to
the
bulkhead
while
doing
so
then
between
explosions
they
got
scoot
back
to
his
bunk
where
they
strapped
him
in
place
the
young
flier
went
to
sleep
again
peacefully
on
the
way
back
to
the
control
room
march
and
mcfee
stopped
to
look
at
the
skipper
sallini
was
with
him
and
he
smiled
temperature
went
about
the
time
you
hit
that
carrier
sir
he
reported
he
s
coming
through
all
right
though
they
ll
have
to
take
those
slugs
out
of
him
pretty
illustration
appeared
in
the
we
ll
get
him
to
a
hospital
march
said
and
then
grabbed
the
door
hard
as
he
heard
the
click
and
then
the
hardest
explosion
of
all
they
can
t
hear
anything
he
said
to
mcfee
do
you
suppose
they
figure
we
re
lying
quiet
down
here
and
are
going
to
send
them
deeper
and
deeper
might
be
mac
said
march
knew
that
if
such
were
the
case
it
would
be
better
to
try
to
zigzag
away
the
next
explosion
was
so
close
that
it
knocked
over
two
men
in
the
control
room
who
thought
they
were
holding
on
fast
the
next
one
knocked
out
the
lights
and
march
shouted
for
the
emergency
system
in
a
moment
there
was
light
again
but
march
was
worried
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
suddenly
he
felt
that
he
just
could
not
make
any
more
decisions
he
wasn
t
supposed
to
be
a
submarine
skipper
yet
anyway
why
decide
well
he
said
to
himself
if
the
next
one
s
any
closer
i
ll
try
moving
away
from
he
waited
tensely
the
next
explosion
would
decide
the
matter
for
him
he
still
waited
it
didn
t
come
he
looked
at
the
sound
man
puzzled
destroyers
moving
away
sir
the
sound
man
reported
then
they
heard
another
explosion
but
this
was
different
it
was
near
the
surface
far
away
and
it
was
not
like
a
depth
charge
then
came
another
and
another
what
can
that
be
march
said
turning
to
mac
darned
if
i
know
the
veteran
said
and
then
it
came
to
march
he
knew
with
a
smile
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
announced
to
everybody
it
s
all
over
folks
those
things
you
hear
are
bombs
from
airplanes
chasing
the
destroyers
away
from
us
and
blasting
the
daylights
out
of
the
convoy
we
ve
the
cheer
that
went
up
was
tired
but
came
from
the
heart
all
over
men
relaxed
their
grips
lit
cigarettes
strolled
for
a
cup
of
coffee
we
ll
just
stay
right
here
where
it
s
safe
for
quite
a
while
longer
march
said
then
we
ll
move
on
was
limping
when
it
came
into
port
and
tied
up
alongside
the
tender
it
had
run
submerged
so
long
that
its
batteries
were
almost
dead
but
as
they
pulled
into
the
little
harbor
the
skipper
came
to
first
saying
take
her
down
take
her
down
and
then
opening
his
eyes
and
looking
around
in
a
daze
he
found
plenty
of
eager
to
tell
him
what
he
had
slept
through
it
s
just
as
well
he
smiled
weakly
when
he
had
heard
i
never
did
like
depth
charge
scoot
was
up
and
about
now
his
arm
in
a
sling
he
would
not
believe
that
he
had
complained
about
the
noise
that
disturbed
his
sleep
during
the
attack
no
one
was
completely
happy
though
until
they
had
full
reports
of
the
convoy
battle
from
the
intelligence
officer
at
the
tender
it
was
with
pride
that
march
anson
carried
the
complete
news
to
skipper
larry
gray
as
he
lay
in
the
small
sick
bay
aboard
the
tender
we
got
the
troopship
ourselves
march
said
the
carrier
was
on
fire
and
listing
badly
when
the
planes
came
and
finished
her
off
not
a
plane
got
off
her
of
the
rest
ships
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
not
one
ship
reached
truk
larry
looked
at
march
silently
and
then
a
slow
smile
spread
over
his
face
skipper
he
said
you
did
a
swell
that
was
all
the
commendation
march
wanted
or
needed
though
he
wasn
t
dismayed
later
when
he
got
the
navy
cross
and
his
promotion
to
full
lieutenant
as
for
scoot
bailey
he
was
flown
to
australia
to
get
over
his
broken
arm
before
resuming
his
flying
from
the
same
award
and
promotion
had
come
to
him
for
his
part
in
breaking
up
the
jap
convoy
and
he
was
very
happy
but
his
last
words
to
march
were
on
the
old
argument
between
them
i
won
t
say
another
word
against
pigboats
he
said
but
i
still
