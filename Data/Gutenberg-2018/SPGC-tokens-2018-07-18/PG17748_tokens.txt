that
the
following
historical
account
of
the
discovery
partial
utilization
and
almost
complete
extermination
of
the
great
american
bison
may
serve
to
cause
the
public
to
fully
realize
the
folly
of
allowing
all
our
most
valuable
and
interesting
american
mammals
to
be
wantonly
destroyed
in
the
same
manner
the
wild
buffalo
is
practically
gone
forever
and
in
a
few
more
years
when
the
whitened
bones
of
the
last
bleaching
skeleton
shall
have
been
picked
up
and
shipped
east
for
commercial
uses
nothing
will
remain
of
him
save
his
old
trails
along
the
a
few
museum
specimens
and
regret
for
his
fate
if
his
untimely
end
fails
even
to
point
a
moral
that
shall
benefit
the
surviving
species
of
mammals
are
now
being
slaughtered
in
like
it
will
be
sad
indeed
although
is
a
true
bison
according
to
scientific
classification
and
not
a
buffalo
the
fact
that
more
than
sixty
millions
of
people
in
this
country
unite
in
calling
him
a
buffalo
and
know
him
by
no
other
name
renders
it
quite
unnecessary
for
me
to
apologize
for
following
in
part
a
harmless
custom
which
has
now
become
so
universal
that
all
the
naturalists
in
the

could
not

the
discovery
of
the
american
bison
as
first
made
by
europeans
occurred
in
the
menagerie
of
a
heathen
king
in
the
year
when
cortez
reached
anahuac
the
american
bison
was
seen
for
the
first
time
by
civilized
europeans
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
thus
characterize
the
horde
of
blood
thirsty
plunder
seekers
who
fought
their
way
to
the
aztec
capital
with
a
degree
of
enterprise
that
marked
him
as
an
enlightened
monarch
montezuma
maintained
for
the
instruction
of
his
people
a
menagerie
of
which
the
historian
de
solis
wrote
as
follows
in
the
second
square
of
the
same
house
were
the
wild
beasts
which
were
either
presents
to
montezuma
or
taken
by
his
hunters
in
strong
cages
of
timber
rang
in
good
order
and
under
cover
lions
tygers
bears
and
all
others
of
the
savage
kind
which
produced
among
which
the
greatest
rarity
was
the
mexican
bull
a
wonderful
composition
of
divers
animals
it
has
crooked
shoulders
with
a
bunch
on
its
back
like
a
camel
its
flanks
dry
its
tail
large
and
its
neck
cover
with
hair
like
a
lion
it
is
cloven
footed
its
head
armed
like
that
of
a
bull
which
it
resembles
in
fierceness
with
no
less
strength
and
agility
thus
was
the
first
seen
buffalo
described
the
nearest
locality
from
whence
it
could
have
come
was
the
state
of
coahuila
in
northern
mexico
between
and
miles
away
and
at
that
time
vehicles
were
unknown
to
the
aztecs
but
for
the
destruction
of
the
whole
mass
of
the
written
literature
of
the
aztecs
by
the
priests
of
the
spanish
conquest
we
might
now
be
reveling
in
historical
accounts
of
the
bison
which
would
make
the
oldest
of
our
present
records
seem
of
comparatively
recent
date
nine
years
after
the
event
referred

the
prototype
of
our
own
distinguished
buffalo
bill
was
wrecked
on
the
gulf
coast
west
of
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
from
whence
he
wandered
westward
through
what
is
now
the
state
of
texas
in
southeastern
texas
he
discovered
the
american
bison
on
his
native
heath
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
this
was
the
earliest
discovery
of
the
bison
in
a
wild
state
and
the
description
of
the
species
as
recorded
by
the
explorer
is
of
historical
interest
it
is
brief
and
superficial
the
unfortunate
explorer
took
very
little
interest
in
animated
nature
except
as
it
contributed
to
the
sum
of
his
daily
food
which
was
then
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
he
almost
starved
this
is
all
he
has
to
say

p
cattle
come
as
far
as
this
i
have
seen
them
three
times
and
eaten
of
their
meat
i
think
they
are
about
the
size
of
those
in
spain
they
have
small
horns
like
those
of
morocco
and
the
hair
long
and
flocky
like
that
of
the
merino
some
are
light
brown
and
others
black
to
my
judgment
the
flesh
is
finer
and
sweeter
than
that
of
this
country
spain
the
indians
make
blankets
of
those
that
are
not
full
grown
and
of
the
larger
they
make
shoes
and
bucklers
they
come
as
far
as
the
of
florida
now
texas
and
in
a
direction
from
the
north
and
range
over
a
district
of
more
than
leagues
in
the
whole
extent
of
plain
over
which
they
roam
the
people
who
live
bordering
upon
it
descend
and
kill
them
for
food
and
thus
a
great
many
skins
are
scattered
throughout
the
country
coronado
was
the
next
explorer
who
penetrated
the
country
of
the
buffalo
which
he
accomplished
from
the
west
by
way
of
arizona
and
new
mexico
he
crossed
the
southern
part
of
the
of
texas
to
the
edge
of
what
is
now
the
indian
territory
and
returned
through
the
same
region
it
was
in
the
year
that
he
reached
the
buffalo
country
and
traversed
the
plains
that
were
full
of
oxen
as
the
mountaine
serena
in
spaine
is
of
sheepe
this
is
the
description
of
the
animal
as
recorded
by
one
of
his
followers
castañeda
and
translated
by
davis
note

spanish
conquest
of
new
mexico
davis
pp
the
first
time
we
encountered
the
buffalo
all
the
horses
took
to
flight
on
seeing
them
for
they
are
horrible
to
the
sight
they
have
a
broad
and
short
face
eyes
two
palms
from
each
other
and
projecting
in
such
a
manner
sideways
that
they
can
see
a
pursuer
their
beard
is
like
that
of
goats
and
so
long
that
it
drags
the
ground
when
they
lower
the
head
they
have
on
the
anterior
portion
of
the
body
a
frizzled
hair
like
sheep
wool
it
is
very
fine
upon
the
croup
and
sleek
like
a
lion
mane
their
horns
are
very
short
and
thick
and
can
scarcely
be
seen
through
the
hair
they
always
change
their
hair
in
may
and
at
this
season
they
really
resemble
lions
to
make
it
drop
more
quickly
for
they
change
it
as
adders
do
their
skins
they
roll
among
the
which
they
find
in
the
ravines
their
tail
is
very
short
and
terminates
in
a
great
tuft
when
they
run
they
carry
it
in
the
air
like
scorpions
when
quite
young
they
are
tawny
and
resemble
our
calves
but
as
age
increases
they
change
color
and
form
another
thing
which
struck
us
was
that
all
the
old
buffaloes
that
we
killed
had
the
left
ear
cloven
while
it
was
entire
in
the
young
we
could
never
discover
the
reason
of
this
their
wool
is
so
fine
that
handsome
clothes
would
certainly
be
made
of
it
but
it
can
not
be
dyed
for
it
is
tawny
red
we
were
much
surprised
at
sometimes
meeting
innumerable
herds
of
bulls
without
a
single
cow
and
other
herds
of
cows
without
bulls
neither
de
soto
ponce
de
leon
vasquez
de
ayllon
nor
pamphilo
de
narvaez
ever
saw
a
buffalo
for
the
reason
that
all
their
explorations
were
made
south
of
what
was
then
the
habitat
of
that
animal
at
the
time
de
soto
made
his
great
exploration
from
florida
northwestward
to
the
mississippi
and
into
arkansas
he
did
indeed
pass
through
country
in
northern
mississippi
and
louisiana
that
was
afterward
inhabited
by
the
buffalo
but
at
that
time
not
one
was
to
be
found
there
some
of
his
soldiers
however
who
were
sent
into
the
northern
part
of
arkansas
reported
having
seen
buffalo
skins
in
the
possession
of
the
indians
and
were
told
that
live
buffaloes
were
to
be
found
or
leagues
north
of
their
farthest
point
the
earliest
discovery
of
the
bison
in
eastern
north
america
or
indeed
anywhere
north
of
coronado
route
was
made
somewhere
near
washington
district
of
columbia
in
by
an
english
navigator
named
samuel

soon

corne
i
set
my

finished

the
of

returned
myself
with
the
ship
into
pembrook
potomac
river
and
so
discovered
to
the
head
of
it
which
is
about
leagues
into
the
land
and
navigable
for
any
ship
and
then
marching
into
the
countrie
i
found
great
store
of
cattle
as
big
as
kine
of
which
the
indians
that
were
my
guides
killed
a
couple
which
we
found
to
be
very
good
and
wholesome
meate
and
are
very
easie
to
be
killed
in
regard

are
heavy
slow
and
not
so
wild
as

it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
narrative
of
the
explorer
affords
no
clew
to
the
precise
locality
of
this
interesting
discovery
but
since
it
is
doubtful
that
the
mariner
journeyed
very
far
on
foot
from
the
head
of
navigation
of
the
potomac
it
seems
highly
probable
that
the
first
american
bison
seen
by
europeans
other
than
the
spaniards
was
found
within
miles
or
even
less
of
the
capital
of
the
united
states
and
possibly
within
the
district
of
columbia
itself
the
first
meeting
of
the
white
man
with
the
buffalo
on
the
northern
boundary
of
that
animal
habitat
occurred
in
when
father
hennepin
ascended
the
lawrence
to
the
great
lakes
and
finally
penetrated
the
great
wilderness
as
far
as
western
illinois
the
next
meeting
with
the
buffalo
on
the
atlantic
slope
was
in
october
by
a
party
of
surveyors
under
william
byrd
who
were
engaged
in
surveying
the
boundary
between
north
carolina
and
virginia
as
the
party
journeyed
up
from
the
coast
marking
the
line
which
now
constitutes
the
interstate
boundary
three
buffaloes
were
seen
on
creek
but
none
of
them
were
killed
on
the
return
journey
in
november
a
bull
buffalo
was
killed
on
creek
which
is
in
halifax
county
virginia
within
miles
of
big
buffalo
creek
longitude
and
miles
from
the
coast
it
was
found
all
alone
tho
buffaloes
seldom
are
the
meat
is
spoken
of
as
a
rarity
not
met
at
all
on
the
expedition
up
the
animal
was
found
in
thick
woods
which
were
thus
feelingly
described
the
woods
were
thick
great
part
of
this
day
journey
so
that
we
were
forced
to
scuffle
hard
to
advance
miles
being
equal
in
fatigue
to
double
that
distance
of
clear
and
open
ground
one
of
the
creeks
which
the
party
crossed
was
christened
buffalo
creek
and
so
named
from
the
frequent
tokens
we
discovered
of
that
american
behemoth
note

p
in

on
another

had
the
good
fortune
to
kill
another
buffalo
near
creek
which
incident
is
thus
described
note
vol
ii
pp
we
pursued
our
journey
thro
uneven
and
perplext
woods
and
in
the
thickest
of
them
had
the
fortune
to
knock
down
a
young
buffalo
years
old
providence
threw
this
vast
animal
in
our
way
very
seasonably
just
as
our
provisions
began
to
fail
us
and
it
was
the
more
welcome
too
because
it
was
change
of
dyet
which
of
all
varietys
next
to
that
of
is
the
most
agreeable
we
had
lived
upon
venison
and
bear
till
our
stomachs
loath
them
almost
as
much
as
the
hebrews
of
old
did
their
quails
our
butchers
were
so
unhandy
at
their
business
that
we
grew
very
lank
before
we
cou
get
our
dinner
but
when
it
came
we
found
it
equal
in
goodness
to
the
best
beef
they
made
it
the
longer
because
they
kept
sucking
the
water
out
of
the
guts
in
imitation
of
the
catauba
indians
upon
the
belief
that
it
is
a
great
cordial
and
will
even
make
them
drunk
or
at
least
very
gay
a
little
later
a
solitary
bull
buffalo
was
found
the
earliest
instance
of
the
kind
on
record
and
which
had
few
successors
to
keep
it
company

p
ii
geographical
distribution
the
range
of
the
american
bison
extended
over
about
of
the
entire
continent
of
north
america
starting
almost
at
on
the
atlantic
coast
it
extended
westward
through
a
vast
tract
of
dense
forest
across
the
alleghany
mountain
system
to
the
prairies
along
the
mississippi
and
southward
to
the
delta
of
that
great
stream
although
the
great
plains
country
of
the
west
was
the
natural
home
of
the
species
where
it
flourished
most
abundantly
it
also
wandered
south
across
texas
to
the
burning
plains
of
northeastern
mexico
westward
across
the
rocky
mountains
into
new
mexico
utah
and
idaho
and
northward
across
a
vast
treeless
waste
to
the
bleak
and
inhospitable
shores
of
the
great
slave
lake
itself
it
is
more
than
probable
that
had
the
bison
remained
unmolested
by
man
and
uninfluenced
by
him
he
would
eventually
have
crossed
the
sierra
nevadas
and
the
coast
range
and
taken
up
his
abode
in
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
pacific
slope
had
the
bison
remained
for
a
few
more
centuries
in
undisturbed
possession
of
his
range
and
with
liberty
to
roam
at
will
over
the
north
american
continent
it
is
almost
certain
that
several
distinctly
recognizable
varieties
would
have
been
produced
the
buffalo
of
the
hot
regions
in
the
extreme
south
would
have
become
a
animal
like
the
gaur
of
india
and
the
african
buffalo
the
individuals
inhabiting
the
extreme
north
in
the
vicinity
of
great
slave
lake
for
example
would
have
developed
still
longer
hair
and
taken
on
more
of
the
dense
hairyness
of
the
musk
ox
in
the
wood
or
mountain
buffalo
we
already
have
a
distinct
foreshadowing
of
the
changes
which
would
have
taken
place
in
the
individuals
which
made
their
permanent
residence
upon
rugged
mountains
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
fill
a
volume
with
facts
relating
to
the
geographical
distribution
of
and
the
dates
of
its
occurrence
and
disappearance
in
the
multitude
of
different
localities
embraced
within
the
immense
area
it
once
inhabited
the
capricious
shiftings
of
certain
sections
of
the
great
herds
whereby
large
areas
which
for
many
years
had
been
utterly
unvisited
by
buffaloes
suddenly
became
overrun
by
them
could
be
followed
up
indefinitely
but
to
little
purpose
in
order
to
avoid
wearying
the
reader
with
a
mass
of
dates
and
references
the
map
accompanying
this
paper
has
been
prepared
to
show
at
a
glance
the
approximate
dates
at
which
the
bison
finally
disappeared
from
the
various
sections
of
its
habitat
in
some
cases
the
date
given
is
coincident
with
the
death
of
the
last
buffalo
known
to
have
been
killed
in
a
given
state
or
territory
in
others
where
records
are
meager
the
date
given
is
the
nearest
approximation
based
on
existing
records
in
the
preparation
of
this
map
i
have
drawn
liberally
from
j
allen
admirable
monograph
of
the
american

in
which
the

has
brought
together
with
great
labor
and
invariable
accuracy
a
vast
amount
of
historical
data
bearing
upon
this
subject
in
this
connection
i
take
great
pleasure
in
acknowledging
my
indebtedness
to
professor
allen
work
while
it
is
inexpedient
to
include
here
all
the
facts
that
might
be
recorded
with
reference
to
the
discovery
existence
and
ultimate
extinction
of
the
bison
in
the
various
portions
of
its
former
habitat
it
is
yet
worth
while
to
sketch
briefly
the
extreme
limits
of
its
range
in
doing
this
our
starting
point
will
be
the
atlantic
slope
east
of
the
alleghanies
and
the
reader
will
do
well
to
refer
to
the
large
map
district
of
there
is
no
indisputable
evidence
that
the
bison
ever
inhabited
this
precise
locality
but
it
is
probable
that
it
did
in
captain
argoll
sailed
up
the
pembrook
river
to
the
head
of
navigation
allen
believes
this
was
the
james
river
and
not
the
potomac
and
marched
inland
a
few
miles
where
he
discovered
buffaloes
some
of
which
were
killed
by
his
indian
guides
if
this
river
was
the
potomac
and
most
authorities
believe
that
it
was
the
buffaloes
seen
by
captain
argoll
might
easily
have
been
in
what
is
now
the
district
of
columbia
admitting
the
existence
of
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
pembrook
river
of
captain
argoll
there
is
yet
another
bit
of
history
which
fairly
establishes
the
fact
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
buffaloes
inhabited
the
banks
of
the
potomac
between
this
city
and
the
lower

an
english
fur
trader
named

then
inhabited

is
the

what

been
adduced
with

to
the

if
either
of
the
references
quoted
may
be
taken
as
conclusive
proof
and
i
see
no
reason
for
disputing
either
then
the
fact
that

ranged

fairly
established

is
reason
to
expect
that

be

both
in

i
venture
to
predict
that
this
will

occur
of
the

it

sufficient
to
allude

evidence
of
the
existence
of
the
buffalo
in
south
carolina
during
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
from
these
it
is
quite
evident
that
in
the
northwestern

of

buffaloes
were
once
fairly
numerous

that

says
a

abundance
of

also
found
there
which
might
be
domesticated
by
rearing
up
the
young
calves
whether
these

were
buffaloes
might
be
considered
an
open
question
but
for
the

additional
information
which
affords
positive
evidence
the

be

during

occurred

severe

up

all
migrated
to
the
country
beyond
the
mississippi
and
never
returned
note
mississippi
as
a
province
territory
and
state
p
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
in
southeastern
texas
in
all
probability
within
miles
of
the
present
city
of
houston
that
the
earliest
discovery
of
the
american
bison
on
its
native
heath
was
made
in
by
cabeza
de

a
and
wholly
wretched
spaniard

the
only
surviving
member
of

celebrated
expedition
which
burned
its

behind
it
in
speaking
of
the
buffalo
in
texas
at
the
earliest
periods
of
which
we
have
any
historical
record
professor
allen
says
they
were
also
found
in
immense
herds
on
the
coast
of
texas
at
the
bay
of
bernard
matagorda
bay
and
on

to
some
authorities
by
la

thence
northwards
across

joutel
says
that
when
in
latitude
the
sight
of
abundance
of
goats
and
bullocks
differing
in
shape
from
ours
and
running
along
the
coast
heightened
our
earnestness
to
be
ashore
they
afterwards
landed
in
louis
bay
now
called
matagorda
bay
where
they
found
buffaloes
in
such
numbers
on
the
colorado
river
that
they
called
it
la
rivière
aux
boeufs
according
to
professor
allen
the
buffalo
did
not
inhabit
the
coast
of
texas
east
of
the
mouth
of
the
brazos
river
note
the
american
bisons
living
and
extinct
p
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
the
state
of
texas
wherein
the
earliest
discoveries
and
observations
upon
the
bison
were
made
should
also
now
furnish
a
temporary
shelter
for
one
of
the
last
remnants
of
the
great
herd
in
regard
to
the
existence
of
the
bison
south
of
the
rio
grande
in
old

there
appears
to
be
but
one

who
at
the
time
of
his
death
left
in
a
work
on
the
mammals
of
mexico
at
one
time
this
was
in
the
smithsonian
institution
but
it
is
there
no
longer
nor
is
its
fate
even
ascertainable
it
is
probable
that
it
was
burned
in
the
fire
that
destroyed
a
portion
of
the
institution
in
fortunately
professor
allen
obtained
and
published
in
his
monograph
in
french
a
copy
of
that
portion
of
berlandier
work
relating
to
the
presence
of
the
bison
in
mexico
of
which
the
following
is
a
translation
note
the
american
bisons
pp
in
mexico
when
the
spaniards
ever
greedy
for
riches
pushed
their
explorations
to
the
north
and
northeast
it
was
not
long
before
they
met
with
the
buffalo
in
the
franciscan
monks
who
discovered
nuevo
leon
encountered
in
the
neighborhood
of
monterey
numerous
herds
of
these
quadrupeds
they
were
also
distributed
in
nouvelle
biscaye
states
of
chihuahua
and
durango
and
they
sometimes
advanced
to
the
extreme
south
of
that
country
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
concentrated
more
and
more
toward
the
north
but
still
remained
very
abundant
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
province
of
bexar
at
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
see
them
recede
gradually
in
the
interior
of
the
country
to
such
an
extent
that
they
became
day
by
day
scarcer
and
scarcer
about
the
settlements
now
it
is
not
in
their
periodical
migrations
that
we
meet
them
near
bexar
every
year
in
the
spring
in
april
or
may
they
advance
toward
the
north
to
return
again
to
the
southern
regions
in
september
and
october
the
exact
limits
of
these
annual
migrations
are
unknown
it
is
however
probable
that
in
the
north
they
never
go
beyond
the
banks
of
the
rio
bravo
at
least
in
the
states
of
cohahuila
and
texas
toward
the
north
not
being
checked
by
the
currents
of
the
missouri
they
progress
even
as
far
as
michigan
and
they
are
found
in
summer
in
the
territories
and
interior
states
of
the
united
states
of
north
america
the
route
which
these
animals
follow
in
their
migrations
occupies
a
width
of
several
miles
and
becomes
so
marked
that
besides
the
verdure
destroyed
one
would
believe
that
the
fields
had
been
covered
with
manure
these
migrations
are
not
general
for
certain
bands
do
not
seem
to
follow
the
general
mass
of
their

from
the

on

we
may
conclude
that
the
buffalo
inhabited
the
temperate
zone
of
the
new
world
and
that
they
inhabited
it
at
all
times
in
the

they
never
advanced
beyond
the

degree
of
latitude

in
the

they
may
have

as

they

which
the
presence
of
the
species
in
the

of

has
been
well
known
in
describing
the
journey
of
espejo
down
the

river
in

davis

spanish
conquest
of

mexico
they
passed
down
a
river
they
called
de
las
or
the
river
of
oxen
the
river
pecos
and
the
same
cow
river
that
vaca
describes
says
professor
allen
and
was
so
named
because
of
the
great
number
of
buffaloes
that
fed
upon
its
banks
they
traveled
down
this
river
the
distance
of
leagues
all
the
way
passing
through
great
herds
of
buffaloes
professor
allen
locates
the
western
boundary
of
the
buffalo
in
new
mexico
even
as
far
west
as
the
western
side
of
rio
grande
del
norte
it
is
well
known
that
buffaloes
though
in
very
small
numbers
once
inhabited
northeastern
utah
and
that
a
few
were
killed
by
the
mormon
settlers
prior
to
in
the
vicinity
of
great
salt
lake
in
the
museum
at
salt
lake
city
i
was
shown
a
very
ancient
mounted
head
of
a
buffalo
bull
which
was
said
to
have
been
killed
in
the
salt
lake
valley
it
is
doubtful
that
such
was
really
fact
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
bison
ever
inhabited
the
southwestern
half
of
utah
and
considering
the
general
sterility
of
the
territory
as
a
whole
previous
to
its
development
by
irrigation
it
is
surprising
that
any
buffalo
in
his
senses
would
ever
set
foot
in
it
at
all
the
former
range
of
the
bison
probably
embraced
the
whole

they
began
to
diminish
very
rapidly
and
continued
to
decrease

when

they
entirely
abandoned

this

about

the

must
have
been
those

very
enterprising

british
at
two
or
three

only
did
the

toward
british
columbia
one
was
the
pass
through
which
the
canadian
pacific
railway
now
runs
miles
north
of
the
international
boundary
according
to
richardson
the
number
of
buffaloes
which
crossed
the
mountains
at
that
point
were
sufficiently
noticeable
to
constitute
a
feature
of
the
fauna
on
the
western
side
of
the
range
it
is
said
that
buffaloes
also
crossed
by
way
of
the
kootenai
pass
which
is
only
a
few
miles
north
of
the
boundary
line
but
the
number
which
did
so
must
have
been
very
small
as
might
be
expected
from
the
character
of
the
country
the
favorite

of

in

was
the
northern
extension
of
the

professor

considers
the
evidence
as

conclusive
that
it
once
existed
in
western

not
only
in
the
vicinity
of
the
eastern

where

also
on
the
shore
of
lake
ontario
probably
in
orleans
county
in
his
monograph
of
the
american
bisons
page
he
gives
the
following
testimony
and
conclusions
on
this
point
the
occurrence
of
a
stream
in
western
new
york
called
buffalo
creek
which
empties
into
the
eastern
end
of
lake
erie
is
commonly
viewed
as
traditional
evidence
of
its
occurrence
at
this
point
but
positive
testimony
to
this
effect
has
thus
far
escaped
me
this
locality
if
it
actually
came
so
far
eastward
must
have
formed
the
eastern
limit
of
its
range
along
the

i
have
found
only
highly
questionable
allusions
to
the
occurrence
of
buffaloes
along
the
southern
shore
of
lake
ontario

the
authority
of

however
has
cited
a
passage
from

new

canaan
as
proof
of
their
former
existence
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
lake
morton
statement
is
based
on
indian
reports
and
the
context
gives
sufficient
evidence
of
the
general
vagueness
of
his
knowledge
of
the
region
of
which
he
was
speaking
the
passage
printed
in
is
as
follows
they
the
indians
have
also
made
descriptions
of
great
heards
of
well
growne
beasts
that

it

tenne
yeares

the

came
to
the
eares

the
to
which
allusion
is
here
made
says
professor
allen
is
unquestionably
the
buffalo
but
the
locality
of
lake
is
not
so
easily
settled
colhoun
regards
it
and
probably
correctly
as
identical
with
lake
ontario
the
extreme
northeastern
limit
of
the
former
range
of
the
buffalo
seems
to
have
been
as
above
stated
in
western

near
the
eastern
end
of

that
it
probably
ranged
thus
far
there
is

the

south
into

to
a

near

of

apparently
the

now

in

there
were
at
one
time
thousands
of
buffaloes
while
there
is
not
at
hand
any
positive
evidence
that
the

ever
inhabited
the
southwestern
portion
of
pennsylvania
its
presence
in
the
locality
mentioned
above
and
in
west
virginia
generally
on
the
south
furnishes
sufficient
reason
for
extending
the
boundary
so
as
to
include
the
southwestern

of

and
connect
with
our
starting
point
the

of

upon

probably
no
other

has
ever
marshaled

as
those
of
the

it
would
have
been
as
easy
to
count
or
to
estimate
the
number
of

in
a

as
to
calculate
the
number
of
buffaloes
living
at
any
given
time
during
the
history
of
the
species
previous
to
even
in
south
central
africa
which
has
always
been
exceedingly
prolific
in
great
herds
of
game
it
is
probable
that
all
its
quadrupeds
taken
together
on
an
equal
area
would
never
have
more
than
equaled
the
total
number
of
buffalo
in
this
country
forty
years
ago
to
an
african
hunter
such
a
statement
may
seem
incredible
but
it
appears
to
be
fully
warranted
by
the
literature
of
both
branches
of
the
subject
not
only
did
the
buffalo
formerly
range
eastward
far
into
the
forest
regions
of

ignorant

we

were

according

were

the

thought
buffalo
were
abundant
in
the
localities
mentioned

the

which
lived
east

comparatively
only
mere
stragglers

may
fairly
be
considered

it
originally
existed

ever
since
and
until
a
few
years
ago

been

the
whole

one
vast
buffalo
range
inhabited
by
millions
of
buffaloes
one
could
fill
a
volume
with
the
records
of
plainsmen
and
pioneers
who
penetrated
or
crossed
that
vast
region
between
and
and
were
in
turn
surprised
astounded
and
frequently
dismayed
by
the
tens
of
thousands
of
buffaloes
they
observed
avoided
or
escaped
from
they
lived
and
moved
as
no
other
quadrupeds
ever
have
in
great
multitudes
like
grand
armies
in

covering
scores
of
square
miles
at
once
they
were
so
numerous
they
frequently
stopped
boats
in
the
rivers
threatened
to
overwhelm
travelers
on
the
plains
and
in
later
years
derailed
locomotives
and
cars
until
railway
engineers
learned
by
experience
the
wisdom
of
stopping
their
trains
whenever
there
were
buffaloes

the
track

this
feature
of
the

life
history
a
few
detailed
observations
may
be
of
value
near
the
mouth
of
the
white
river
in
southwestern
dakota
lewis
and
clark
saw
in
a
herd
of
buffalo
which
caused
them
to
make
the
following
record
in
their
journal
these
last
animals
buffaloes
are
now
so
numerous
that
from
an
eminence
we
discovered
more
than
we
had
ever
seen
before
at
one
time
and
if
it
be
not
impossible
to
calculate
the
moving
multitude
which
darkened
the
whole
plains
we
are
convinced
that
twenty
thousand
would
be
no
exaggerated
number
when
near
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
on
their
way
down
the
missouri
a
previous
record
had
been
made
of
a
meeting
with
other
herds
the
buffalo
now
appear
in
vast
numbers
a
herd
happened
to
be
on
their
way
across
the
river
the
missouri
such
was
the
multitude
of
these
animals
that
although
the
river
including
an
island
over
which
they
passed
was
a
mile
in
length
the
herd
stretched
as
thick
as
they
could
swim
completely
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
the
party
was
obliged
to
stop
for
an
hour
they
consoled
themselves
for
the
delay
by
killing
four
of
the
herd
and
then
proceeded
till
at
the
distance
of
miles
they
halted
on
an
island
below
which
two
other
herds
of
buffalo
as
numerous
as
the
first
soon
after
crossed
the
river
note
lewis
and
clark
ii
p
perhaps
the
most
vivid
picture
ever
afforded
of
the
former
abundance
of
buffalo
is
that
given
by
i
dodge
in
his
plains
of
the
great
west
it
is
well
worth
reproducing
entire
in
may
i
drove
in
a
light
wagon
from
old
fort
zara
to
fort
larned
on
the
arkansas
miles
at
least
miles
of
this
distance
was
through
one
immense
herd
composed
of
countless
smaller
herds
of
buffalo
then
on
their
journey
north
the
road
ran
along
the
broad
level
or
valley
of
the
river
the
whole
country
appeared
one
great
mass
of
buffalo
moving
slowly
to
the
northward
and
it
was
only
when
actually
among
them
that
it
could
be
ascertained
that
the
apparently
solid
mass
was
an
agglomeration
of
innumerable
small
herds
of
from
fifty
to
two
hundred
animals
separated
from
the
surrounding
herds
by
greater
or
less
space
but
still
separated
the
herds
in
the
valley
sullenly
got
out
of
my
way
and
turning
stared
stupidly
at
me
sometimes
at
only
a
few
yards
distance
when
i
had
reached
a
point
where
the
hills
were
no
longer
more
than
a
mile
from
the
road
the
buffalo
on
the
hills
seeing
an
unusual
object
in
their
rear
turned
stared
an
instant
then
started
at
full
speed
directly
towards
me
stampeding
and
bringing
with
them
the
numberless
herds
through
which
they
passed
and
pouring
down
upon
me
all
the
herds
no
longer
separated
but
one
immense
compact
mass
of
plunging
animals
mad
with
fright
and
as
irresistible
as
an
avalanche
the
situation
was
by
no
means
pleasant
reining
up
my
horse
which
was
fortunately
a
quiet
old
beast
that
had
been
in
at
the
death
of
many
a
buffalo
so
that
their
wildest
maddest
rush
only
caused
him
to
cock
his
ears
in
wonder
at
their
unnecessary
excitement
i
waited
until
the
front
of
the
mass
was
within
yards
when
a
few
shots
from
my
rifle
split
the
herd
and
sent
it
pouring
off
in
two
streams
to
my
right
and
left
when
all
had
passed
me
they
stopped
apparently
perfectly
satisfied
though
thousands
were
yet
within
reach
of
my
rifle
and
many
within
less
than
yards
disdaining
to
fire
again
i
sent
my
servant
to
cut
out
the
tongues
of
the
fallen
this
occurred
so
frequently
within
the
next
miles
that
when
i
arrived
at
fort
larned
i
had
tongues
in
my
wagon
representing
the
greatest
number
of
buffalo
that
my
conscience
can
reproach
me
for
having
murdered
on
any
single
day
i
was
not
hunting
wanted
no
meat
and
would
not
voluntarily
have
fired
at
these
herds
i
killed
only
in
and
fired
almost
every
shot
from
the
wagon
at
my
request
colonel
dodge
has
kindly
furnished
me
a
careful
estimate
upon
which
to
base
a
calculation
of
the
number
of
buffaloes
in
that
great
herd
and
the
result
is
very
interesting
in
a
private
letter
dated
september
he
writes
as
follows
the
great
herd
on
the
arkansas
through
which
i
passed
could
not
have
averaged
over
fifteen
or
twenty
individuals
to
the
acre
but
was
from
my
own
observation
not
less
than
miles
wide
and
from
reports
of
hunters
and
others
it
was
about
five
days
in
passing
a
given
point
or
not
less
than
miles
deep
from
the
top
of
pawnee
rock
i
could
see
from
to
miles
in
almost
every
direction
this
whole
vast
space
was
covered
with
buffalo
looking
at
a
distance
like
one
compact
mass
the
visual
angle
not
permitting
the
ground
to
be
seen
i
have
seen
such
a
sight
a
great
number
of
times
but
never
on
so
large
a
scale
that
was
the
last
of
the
great
herds
with
these
figures
before
us
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
a
calculation
that
will
be
somewhere
near
the
truth
of
the
number
of
buffaloes
actually
seen
in
one
day
by
colonel
dodge
on
the
arkansas
river
during
that
memorable
drive
and
also
of
the
number
of
head
in
the
entire
herd
according
to
his
recorded
observation
the
herd
extended
along
the
river
for
a
distance
of
miles
which
was
in
reality
the
width
of
the
vast
procession
that
was
moving
north
and
back
from
the
road
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
both
sides
it
is
making
a
low
estimate
to
consider
the
extent
of
the
visible
ground
at
mile
on
either
side
this
gives
a
strip
of
country
miles
wide
by
long
or
a
total
of
square
miles
covered
with
buffalo
averaging
from
fifteen
to
twenty
to
the
acre
taking
the
lesser
number
in
order
to
be
below
the
truth
rather
than
above
it
we
find
that
the
number
actually
seen
on
that
day
by
colonel
dodge
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
not
counting
the
additional
number
taken
in
at
the
view
from
the
top
of
pawnee
rock
which
if
added
would
easily
bring
the
total
up
to
a
round
half
million
note
on
the
plains
of
dakota
the
rev
belcourt
indians
iv
once
counted
two
hundred
and
buffaloes
a
part
of
a
great
herd
feeding
on
a
single
acre
of
ground
this
of
course
was
an
unusual
occurrence
with
buffaloes
not
stampeding
but
practically
at
rest
it
is
quite
possible
also
that
the
extent
of
the
ground
may
have
been
underestimated
if
the
advancing
multitude
had
been
at
all
points
miles
in
length
as
it
was
known
to
have
been
in
some
places
at
least
by
miles
in
width
and
still
averaged
fifteen
head
to
the
acre
of
ground
it
would
have
contained
the
enormous
number
of
head
but
judging
from
the
general
principles
governing
such
migrations
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
moving
mass
advanced
in
the
shape
of
a
wedge
which
would
make
it
necessary
to
deduct
about
from
the
grand
total
which
would
leave
as
our
estimate
of
the
actual
number
of
buffaloes
in
this
great
herd
which
i
believe
is
more
likely
to
be
below
the
truth
than
above
it
no
wonder
that
the
men
of
the
west
of
those
days
both
white
and
red
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
exterminate
such
a
mighty
multitude
the
indians
of
some
tribes
believed
that
the
buffaloes
issued
from
the
earth
continually
and
that
the
supply
was
necessarily
inexhaustible
and
yet
in
four
short
years
the
southern
herd
was
almost
totally
annihilated
with
such
a
lesson
before
our
eyes
confirmed
in
every
detail
by
living
testimony
who
will
dare
to
say
that
there
will
be
an
elk
moose
caribou
mountain

alive

the

states

the
following
testimony
to
the
abundance
of
buffalo
in
kansas
note
plains
of
the
great
west
p
xvi
in
the
autumn
of
whilst
crossing
the
plains
on
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
for
a
distance
of
upwards
of
miles
between
ellsworth
and
sheridan
we
passed
through
an
almost
unbroken
herd
of
buffalo
the
plains
were
blackened
with
them
and
more
than
once
the
train
had
to
stop
to
allow
unusually
large
herds
to
pass
in
whilst
on
a
scout
for
about
a
hundred
miles
south
of
fort
dodge
to
the
indian
territory
we
were
never
out
of
sight
of
buffalo
twenty
years
hence
when
not
even
a
bone
or
a
remains
above
ground
throughout
the
west
to
mark
the
presence
of
the
buffalo
it
may
be
difficult
for
people
to
believe
that
these
animals
ever
existed
in
such
numbers
as
to
constitute
not
only
a
serious
annoyance
but
very
often
a
dangerous
menace
to
wagon
travel
across
the
plains
and
also
to
stop
railway
trains
and
even
throw
them
off
the
track
the
like
has
probably
never
occurred
before
in
any
country
and
most
assuredly
never
will
again
if
the
present
rate
of
large
game
destruction
all
over
the
world
can
be
taken
as
a
foreshadowing
of
the
future
in
this
connection
the
following
additional
testimony
from
colonel
dodge
plains
of
the
great
west
is
of
interest
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
railroad
was
then
in
in
process
of
construction
and
nowhere
could
the
peculiarity
of
the
buffalo
of
which
i
am
speaking
be
better
studied
than
from
its
trains
if
a
herd
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
track
it
would
stand
stupidly
gazing
and
without
a
symptom
of
alarm
although
the
locomotive
passed
within
a
hundred
yards
if
on
the
south
side
of
the
track
even
though
at
a
distance
of
or
miles
from
it
the
passage
of
a
train
set
the
whole
herd
in
the
wildest
commotion
at
full
speed
and
utterly
regardless
of
the
consequences
it
would
make
for
the
track
on
its
line
of
retreat
if
the
train
happened
not
to
be
in
its
path
it
crossed
the
track
and
stopped
satisfied
if
the
train
was
in
its
way
each
individual
buffalo
went
at
it
with
the
desperation
of
despair
plunging
against
or
between
locomotive
and
cars
just
as
its
blind
madness
chanced
to
direct
it
numbers
were
killed
but
numbers
still
pressed
on
to
stop
and
stare
as
soon
as
the
obstacle
had
passed
after
having
trains
thrown
off
the
track
twice
in
one
week
conductors
learned
to
have
a
very
decided
respect
for
the
idiosyncrasies
of
the
buffalo
and
when
there
was
a
possibility
of
striking
a
herd
the
rampage
for
the
north
side
of
the
track
the
train
was
slowed
up
and
sometimes
stopped
entirely
the
accompanying
illustration
reproduced
from
the
plains
of
the
great
west
by
the
kind
permission
of
the
author
is
in
one
sense
ocular
proof
that
collisions
between
railway
trains
and
vast
herds
of
buffaloes
were
so
numerous
that
they
formed
a
proper
subject
for
illustration
in
regard
to
the
stoppage
of
trains
and
derailment
of
locomotives
by
buffaloes
colonel
dodge
makes
the
following
allusion
in
the
private
letter

there
are
at
least
a
hundred
reliable
railroad
men
now
employed
on
the
atchison

and

who
were
witnesses
of
and
sometimes
sufferers
from
the
wild
rushes
of
buffalo
as
described
on
page
of
my
book
i
was
at
the
time
stationed
at

the
following
from
the
ever
pleasing
pen
of
catlin
is
of
decided
interest
in
this
connection
in
one
instance
near
the
mouth
of
white
river
we
met
the
most
immense
herd
crossing
the
missouri
river
in
dakota
and
from
an
imprudence
got
our
boat
into
imminent
danger
amongst
them
from
which
we
were
highly
delighted
to
make
our
escape
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
season
and
we
had
heard
the
as
it
is
called
of
the
herd
when
we
were
several
miles
from
them
when
we
came
in
sight
we
were
actually
terrified
at
the
immense
numbers
that
were
streaming
down
the
green
hills
on
one
side
of
the
river
and
galloping
up
and
over
the
bluffs
on
the
other
the
river
was
filled
and
in
parts
blackened
with
their
heads
and
horns
as
they
were
swimming
about
following
up
their
objects
and
making
desperate
battle
whilst
they
were
swimming
i
deemed
it
imprudent
for
our
canoe
to
be
dodging
amongst
them
and
ran
it
ashore
for
a
few
hours
where
we
laid
waiting
for
the
opportunity
of
seeing
the
river
clear
but
we
waited
in
vain
their
numbers
however
got
somewhat
diminished
at
last
and
we
pushed
off
and
successfully
made
our
way
amongst
them
from
the
immense
numbers
that
had
passed
the
river
at
that
place
they
had
torn
down
the
prairie
bank
of
feet
in
height
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
road
or
landing
place
where
they
all
in
succession
clambered
up

in
their
turmoil
had
been
wafted
below
this
landing
and
unable
to
regain
it
against
the
swiftness
of
the
current
had
fastened
themselves
along
in

hugging
close
to
the

they
were
standing
as
we
were
drifting
by

supposing
ourselves
out

i
drew
up
my
rifle
and
shot
one
of
them
in
the

which
tumbled
into
the
water
and
brought
with
him
a
hundred
others
which
plunged
in
and
in

moment
were
swimming
about
our
canoe
and
placing
it
in
great
danger
no
attack
was
made
upon
us
and
in
the
confusion
the
poor
beasts
knew
not
perhaps
the
enemy
that
was
amongst
them
but
we
were
liable
to
be
sunk
by
them
as
they
were
furiously
hooking
and
climbing
on
to
each
other
i
rose
in
my
canoe
and
by
my
gestures
and
hallooing
kept
them
from
coming

who
could
find
it
in

heart
to
murder
a
majestic

bison
for
a
hide
worth
only

dollar
should
form
a
estimate
of
the
grandest
ruminant
that
ever
trod

also
entertain
a
similar
estimate
of

an
acquaintance
which
includes
fine
living
examples
of
all
the
larger
ruminants
of
the
world
except
the
and
the
european
bison
i
am
sure
that
the
american
bison
is
the
grandest
of
them
all
his
only
rivals
for
the
kingship
are
the
indian
bison
or
gaur
of
southern
india
and
the
aurochs
or
european
bison
both
of
which
really
surpass
him
in
height
if
not
in
actual
balk
also
the
aurochs
is
taller
and
possesses
a
larger
pelvis
and
heavier
stronger
hindquarters
but
his
body
is
decidedly
smaller
in
all
its
proportions
which
gives
him
a
lean
and
leggy
look
the
hair
on
the
head
neck
and
forequarters
of
the
aurochs
is
not
nearly
so
long
or
luxuriant
as
on
the
same
parts
of
the
american
bison
this
covering
greatly
magnifies
the
actual
bulk
of
the
latter
animal
clothe
the
aurochs
with
the
wonderful
pelage
of
our
buffalo
give
him
the
same
enormous
chest
and
body
and
the
result
would
be
a
magnificent
bovine
monster
who
would
indeed
stand
without
a
rival
but
when
types
of
the
two
species
are
placed
side
by
side
it
seems
to
me
that
will
easily
rank
his
european
rival
the
gaur
has
no
long
hair
upon
any
part
of
his
body
or
head
what
little
hair
he
has
is
very
short
and
thin
his
hindquarters
being
almost
naked
i
have
seen
hundreds
of
these
animals
at
short
range
and
have
killed
and
skinned
several
very
fine
specimens
one
of
which
stood
feet
inches
in
height
at
the
shoulders
but
despite
his
larger
bulk
his
appearance
is
not
nearly
so
striking
and
impressive
as
that
of
the
male
american
bison
he
seems
like
a
huge
ox
running
wild
the
magnificent
dark
brown
frontlet
and
beard
of
the
buffalo
the
shaggy
coat
of
hair
upon
the
neck
hump
and
shoulders
terminating
at
the
knees
in
a
thick
mass
of
luxuriant
black
locks
to
say
nothing
of
the
dense
coat
of
finer
fur
on
the
body
and
hindquarters
give
to
our
species
not
only
an
apparent
height
equal
to
that
of
the
gaur
but
a
grandeur
and
nobility
of
presence
which
are
beyond
all
comparison
amongst
ruminants
the
slightly
larger
bulk
of
the
gaur
is
of
little
significance
in
a
comparison
of
the
two
species
for
if
size
alone
is
to
turn
the
scale
we
must
admit
that
a
lioness
with
no
mane
whatever
is
a
more
majestic
looking
animal
than
a
lion
with
a
mane
which
has
earned
him
his
title
of
king
of
beasts
of
form
in
by
a
combination
of
unfortunate
circumstances
the
american
bison
is
destined
to
go
down
to
posterity
shorn
of
the
honor
which
is
his
due
and
appreciated
at
only
half
his
worth
the
hunters
who
slew
him
were
from
the
very
beginning
so
absorbed
in
the
scramble
for
spoils
that
they
had
no
time
to
measure
or
weigh
him
nor
even
to
notice
the
majesty
of
his
personal
appearance
on
his
native
heath
in
captivity
he
fails
to
develop
as
finely
as
in
his
wild
state
and
with
the
loss
of
his
liberty
he
becomes
a
animal
he
gets
fat
and
and
the
lack
of
vigorous
and
constant
exercise
prevents
the
development
of
bone
and
muscle
which
made
the
prairie
animal
what
he
was
from
observations
made
upon
buffaloes
that
have
been
reared
in
captivity
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
confinement
and
are
destined
to
effect
striking
changes
in
the
form
of
while
this
is
to
be
expected
to
a
certain
extent
with
most
large
species
the
changes
promise
to
be
most
conspicuous
in
the
buffalo
the
most
striking
change
is
in
the
body
between
the
hips
and
the
shoulders
as
before
remarked
it
becomes
astonishingly
short
and
rotund
and
through
liberal
feeding
and
total
lack
of
exercise
the
muscles
of
the
shoulders
and
hindquarters
especially
the
latter
are
but
feebly
developed
the
most
striking
example
of
the
change
of
form
in
the
captive
buffalo
is
the
cow
in
the
central
park
menagerie
new
york
although
this
animal
is
fully
adult
and
has
given
birth
to
three
fine
calves
she
is
small
astonishingly
and
in
comparison
with
the
magnificently
developed
cows
taken
in
by
the
writer
in
montana
she
seems
almost
like
an
animal
of
another
species
both
the
live
buffaloes
in
the
national
museum
collection
of
living
animals
are
developing
the
same
shortness
of
body
and
lack
of
muscle
and
when
they
attain
their
full
growth
will
but
poorly
resemble
the
splendid
proportions
of
the
wild
specimens
in
the
museum
mounted
group
each
of
which
has
been
mounted
from
a
most
careful
and
elaborate
series
of
measurements
it
may
fairly
be
considered
however
that
the
specimens
taken
by
the
smithsonian
expedition
were
in
every
way
more
perfect
representatives
of
the
species
than
have
been
usually
taken
in
times
past
for
the
simple
reason
that
on
account
of
the
muscle
they
had
developed
in
the
numerous
chases
they
had
survived
and
the
total
absence
of
the
fat
which
once
formed
such
a
prominent
feature
of
the
animal
they
were
of
finer
form
more
active
habit
and
keener
intelligence
than
buffaloes
possessed
when
they
were
so
numerous
out
of
the
millions
which
once
composed
the
great
northern
herd
those
represented
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
their
existence
at
that
time
was
chiefly
due
to
the
keenness
of
their
senses
and
their
splendid
muscular
powers
in
speed
and
endurance
under
such
conditions
it
is
only
natural
that
animals
of
the
highest
class
should
be
developed
on
the
other
hand
captivity
reverses
all
these
conditions
while
yielding
an
equally
abundant
food
supply
in
no
feature
is
the
change
from
natural
conditions
to
captivity
more
easily
noticeable
than
in
the
eye
in
the
wild
buffalo
the
eye
is
always
deeply
set
well
protected
by
the
edge
of
the
bony
orbit
and
perfect
in
form
and
expression
the
lids
are
firmly
drawn
around
the
ball
the
opening
is
so
small
that
the
white
portion
of
the
eyeball
is
entirely
covered
and
the
whole
form
and
appearance
of
the
organ
is
as
shapely
and
as
pleasing
in
expression
as
the
eye
of
a
deer
in
the
captive
the
various
muscles
which
support
and
control
the
eyeball
seem
to
relax
and
thicken
and
the
ball
protrudes
far
beyond
its
normal
plane
showing
a
circle
of
white
all
around
the
iris
and
bulging
out
in
a
most
unnatural
way
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that
this
is
common
in
captive
buffaloes
generally
but
i
have
observed
it
to
be
disagreeably
conspicuous
in
many
another
change
which
takes
place
in
the
form
of
the
captive
buffalo
is
an
arching
of
the
back
in
the
middle
which
has
a
tendency
to
make
the
hump
look
lower
at
the
shoulders
and
visibly
alters
the
outline
of
the
back
this
tendency
to
hump
up
the
back
is
very
noticeable
in
domestic
cattle
and
horses
during
rainy
weather
while
a
buffalo
on
his
native
heath
would
seldom
assume
such
an
attitude
of
dejection
and
misery
in
captivity
especially
if
it
be
anything
like
close
confinement
it
is
often
to
be
observed
and
i
fear
will
eventually
become
a
permanent
habit
indeed
i
think
it
may
be
confidently
predicted
that
the
time
will
come
when
naturalists
who
have
never
seen
a
wild
buffalo
will
compare
the
specimens
composing
the
national
museum
group
with
the
living
representatives
to
be
seen
in
captivity
and
assert
that
the
former
are
exaggerations
in
both
form
and
size
specimens
in
of
the
stuffed
specimens
to
be
found
in
museums
all
that
i
have
ever
seen
outside
of
the
national
museum
and
even
those
within
that
institution
up
to
were
stuffed
in
reality
as
well
as
in
name
the
skins
that
have
been
rammed
full
of
straw
or
excelsior
have
lost
from
to
inches
in
height
at
the
shoulders
and
the
high
and
sharp
hump
of
the
male
has
become
a
huge
thick
rounded
mass
like
the
hump
of
a
dromedary
and
totally
unlike
the
hump
of
a
bison
it
is
impossible
for
any
taxidermist
to
stuff
a
with
loose
materials
and
produce
a
specimen
which
fitly
represents
the
species
the
proper
height
and
form
of
the
animal
can
be
secured
and
retained
only
by
the
construction
of
a
manikin
or
statue
to
carry
the
skin
in
view
of
this
fact
which
surely
must
be
apparent
to
even
the
most
casual
observer
it
is
to
be
earnestly
hoped
that
here
no
one
in
authority
will
ever
consent
to
mount
or
have
mounted
a
valuable
skin
of
a
bison
in
any
other
way
than
over
a
properly
constructed
manikin
the
breeding
season
of
the
buffalo
is
from
the
of
july
to
the
of
october
the
young
cow
does
not
breed
until
she
is
three
years
old
and
although
two
calves
are
sometimes
produced
at
a
birth
one
is
the
usual
number
the
calves
are
born
in
april
may
and
june
and
sometimes
though
rarely
as
late
as
the
middle
of
august
the
calf
follows
its
mother
until
it
is
a
year
old
or
even
older
in
may
the
smithsonian
expedition
captured
a
calf
alive
which
had
been
abandoned
by
its
mother
because
it
could
not
keep
up
with
her
the
little
creature
was
apparently
between
two
and
three
weeks
old
and
was
therefore
born

on

a
point
just
back

the

begin
to
shed
their

of

hair
about
the
beginning
of

the
first
signs
of
the
change
however
appear
about
a
month
earlier
than
that
in
the
darkening
of
the
mane
under
the
throat
and
also
on
the
top
of
the

note
our
captive
had
in
some
way
bruised
the
skin
on
his
forehead
and
in
june
all
the
hair
came
off
the
top
of
his
head
leaving
it
quite
bald
we
kept
the
skin
well
greased
with
porpoise
oil
and
by
the
middle
of
july
a
fine
coat
of
black
hair
had
grown
out
all
over
the
surface
that
had
previously
been
bare
by
the
of
august
the
red
hair
on
the
body
begins
to
fall
off
in
small
patches
and
the
growth
of
fine
new
dark
hair
seems
to
actually
crowd
off
the
old
as
is
the
case
with
the
adult
animals
the
shortest
hair
is
the
first
to
be
shed
but
the
change
of
coat
takes
place
in
about
half
the
time
that
it
occupies
in
the
older
animals
by
the
of
october
the
transformation
is
complete
and
not
even
a
patch
of
the
old
red
hair
remains
upon
the
new
suit
of
brown
this
is
far
from
being
the
case
with
the
old
bulls
and
cows
for
even
up
to
the
last
week
in
october
we
found
them
with
an
occasional
patch
of
the
old
hair
still
clinging
to
the
new
on
the
back
or
shoulders
like
most
young
animals
the
calf
of
the
buffalo
is
very
easily
tamed
especially
if
taken
when
only
a
few
weeks
old
the
one
captured
in
montana
by
the
writer
resisted
at
first
as
stoutly
as
it
was
able
by
butting
with
its
head
but
after
we
had
tied
its
legs
together
and
carried
it
to
camp
across
a
horse
it
made
up
its
mind
to
yield
gracefully
to
the
inevitable
and
from
that
moment
became
perfectly
docile
it
very
soon
learned
to
drink
milk
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
and
adapted
itself
to
its
new
surroundings
quite
as
readily
as
any
domestic
calf
would
have
done
its
only
cry
was
a
grunt
through
the
nose
which
was
uttered
only
when
hungry
or
thirsty
i
have
been
told
by
old
frontiersmen
and
that
it
used
to
be
a
common
practice
for
a
hunter
who
had
captured
a
young
calf
to
make
it
follow
him
by
placing
one
of
his
fingers
in
its
mouth
and
allowing
the
calf
to
suck
at
it
for
a
moment
often
a
calf
has
been
induced
in
this
way
to
follow
a
horseman
for
miles
and
eventually
to
join
his
camp
outfit
it
is
said
that
the
same
result
has
been
accomplished
with
calves
by
breathing
a
few
times
into
their
nostrils

catlin
observations
on
the
habits
of
buffalo
calves
are
most
interesting
in
pursuing
a
large
herd
of
buffaloes
at
the
season
when
their
calves
are
but
a
few
weeks
old
i
have
often
been
exceedingly
amused
with
the
curious
maneuvers
of
these
shy
little
things
amidst
the
thundering
confusion
of
a
throng
of
several
hundreds
or
several
thousands
of
these
animals
there
will
be
many
of
the
calves
that
lose
sight
of
their
dams
and
being
left
behind
by
the
throng
and
the
hunters
they
endeavor
to
secrete
themselves
when
they
are
exceedingly
put
to
it
on
a
level
prairie
where
naught
can
be
seen
but
the
short
grass
of
or
inches
in
height
save
an
occasional
bunch
of
wild
sage
a
few
inches
higher
to
which
the
poor
affrighted
things
will
run
and
dropping
on
their
knees
will
push
their
noses
under
it
and
into
the
grass
where
they
will
stand
for
hours
with
their
eyes
shut
imagining
themselves
securely
hid
whilst
they
are
standing
up
quite
straight
upon
their
hind
feet
and
can
easily
be
seen
at
several
miles
distance
it
is
a
familiar
amusement
with
us
accustomed
to
these
scenes
to
retreat
back
over
the
ground
where
we
have
just
escorted
the
herd
and
approach
these
little
trembling
things
which
stubbornly
maintain
their
positions
with
their
noses
pushed
under
the
grass
and
their
eyes
strained
upon
us
us
we
dismount
from
our
horses
and
are
passing
around
them
from
this
fixed
position
they
are
sure
not
to
move
until
hands
are
laid
upon
them
and
then
for
the
shins
of
a
novice
we
can
extend
our
sympathy
or
if
he
can
preserve
the
skin
on
his
bones
from
the
furious
buttings
of
its
head
we
know
how
to
congratulate
him
on
his
signal
success
and
good
luck

in
these
desperate
struggles
for
a

the
little
thing
is
conquered
and
makes
no
further
resistance
and
i
have
often
in
concurrence
with
a
known
custom
of
the
country
held
my
hands
over
the
eyes
of
the
calf
and
breathed
a

strong
breaths
into
its
nostrils
after
which
i
have
with
my
hunting
companions
rode
several
miles
into
our
encampment
with
the
little
prisoner
busily
following
the
heels
of
my
horse
the
whole
way
as
closely
and
as
affectionately
as
its
instinct
would
attach
it
to
the
company
of
its
dam
this
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
that
i
have
met
with
in
the
habits
of
this
wild
country
and
although
i
had
often
heard
of
it
and
felt
unable
exactly
to
believe
it
i
am
now
willing
to
bear
testimony
to
the
fact
from
the
numerous
instances
which
i
have
witnessed
since
i
came
into
the
country
during
the
time
that
i
resided
at
this
post
mouth
of
the
tetón
river
in
the
spring
of
the
year
on
my
way
up
the
river
i
assisted
in
numerous
hunts
of
the
buffalo
with
the
fur
company
men
in
bringing
in
in
the
above
manner
several
of
these
little
prisoners
which
sometimes
followed
for
or
miles
close
to
our
horse
heels
and
even
into
the
fur
company
fort
and
into
the
stable
where
our
horses
were
led
in
this
way
before
i
left
the
headwaters
of
the
missouri
i
think
we
had
collected
about
a
dozen
which
laidlaw
was
successfully
raising
with
the
aid
of
a
good
milch
cow
note
north
american
indians
i
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
such
cases
as
the
above
were
exceptional
even
with
the
very
young
calves
which
alone
exhibited
the
trait
described
such
instances
occurred
only
when
buffaloes
existed
in
such
countless
numbers
that
man
presence
and
influence
had
not
affected
the
character
of
the
animal
in
the
least
no
such
instances
of
innocent
stupidity
will
ever
be
displayed
again
even
by
the
youngest
calf
the
war
of
extermination
and
the
struggle
for
life
and
security
have
instilled
into
the
calf
even
from
its
birth
a
mortal
fear
of
both
men
and
horses
and
the
instinct
to
fly
for
life
the
calf
captured
by
our
party
was
not
able
to
run
but
in
the
most
absurd
manner
it
butted
our
horses
as
soon
as
they
came
near
enough
and
when
private
moran
attempted
to
lay
hold
of
the
little
fellow
it
turned
upon
him
struck
him
in
the
stomach
with
its
head
and
sent
him
sprawling
into
the

it
had
only
possessed
the
strength
it
would
have
led
us

lively
chase

four
other
buffalo
calves

either
killed
or
caught
by
the
cowboys
on
the
divide
in
the
dry
creek
region
all
of
them
ran
the
moment
they
discovered
their
enemies
two
were
shot
and
killed
one
was
caught
by
a
cowboy
named
horace
brodhurst
ear
marked
and
turned
loose
the
fifth
one
was
caught
in
september
on
the
porcupine
creek
he
was
then
about
five
months
old
and
being
abundantly
able
to
travel
he
showed
a
clean
pair
of
heels
it
took
three
fresh
horses
one
after
another
to
catch
him
and
his
final
capture
was
due
to
exhaustion
and
not
to
the
speed
of
any
of
his
pursuers
the
distance
covered
by
the
chase
from
the
point
where
his
first
pursuer
started
to
where
the
third
one
finally
lassoed
him
was
considered
to
be
at
least
miles
but
the
capture
came
to
naught
for
on
the
following
day
the
calf
died
from
overexertion
and
want
of
milk
colonel
dodge
states
that
the
very
young
calves
of
a
herd
have
to
depend
upon
the
old
bulls
for
protection
and
seldom
in
vain
the
mothers
abandon
their
offspring
on
slight
provocation
and
even
none
at
all
sometimes
if
we
may
judge
from
the
condition
of
the
little
waif
that
fell
into
our
hands
had
its
mother
remained
with
it
or
even
in
its
neighborhood
we
should
at
least
have
seen
her
but
she
was
nowhere
within
a
radius
of
miles
at
the
time
her
calf
was
discovered
nor
did
she
return
to
look
for
it
as
two
of
us
proved
by
spending
the
night
in
the
at
the
very
spot
where
the
calf
was
taken
colonel
dodge
declares
that
the
cow
seems
to
possess
scarcely
a
trace
of
maternal
instinct
and
when
frightened
will
abandon
and
run
away
from
her
calf
without
the
slightest
hesitation
when
the
calves
are
young
they
are
always
kept
in
the
center
of
each
small
herd
while
the
bulls
dispose
themselves
on
the
outside
note
plains
of
the
great
west
pp
apparently
the
maternal
instinct
of
the
cow
buffalo
was
easily
mastered
by
fear
that
it
was
often
manifested

by

which
they

just
swam

the

can
not
help
them
although
they
stand
near

will
not

however
the
cows
leave
the
young
to
their
fate
when
most
of
them
perish
in
connection
with
this
part
of
the
subject
we
may
add
that
we
were
informed
when
on
the
upper
missouri
river
that
when
the
banks
of
that
river
were
practicable
for
cows
and
their
calves
could
not
follow
them
they
went
down
again
after
having
gained
the
top
and
would
remain
by
them
until
forced
away
by
the
cravings
of
hunger
when
thus
forced
by
the
necessity
of
saving
themselves
to
quit
their
young
they
seldom
if
ever
return
to
them
when
a
large
herd
of
these
wild
animals
are
crossing
a
river
the
calves
or
yearlings
manage
to
get
on
the
backs
of
the
cows
and
are
thus
conveyed
safely
over
during
the
first
five
months
of
his
life
the
calf
changes
its
coat
completely
and
becomes
in
appearance
a
totally
different
animal
by
the
time
he
is
six
months
old
he
has
taken
on
all
the
colors
which
distinguish
him
in
after
life
excepting
that
upon
his
fore
quarters
the
hair
on
the
head
has
started
out
to
attain
the
luxuriant
length
and
density
which
is
so
conspicuous
in
the
adult
and
its
general
color
is
a
rich
dark
brown
shading
to
black
under
the
chin
and
throat
the
fringe
under
the
neck
is
long
straight
and
black
and
the
under
parts
the
back
of
the
fore
arm
the
outside
of
thigh
and
the
are
all
black
the
color
of
the
shoulder
the
side
and
upper
part
of
the
hind
quarter
is
a
peculiar
smoky
brown
broccoli

of
ridgway
having
in
connection
with
the
darker
browns
of
the
other
parts
a
peculiar
faded
appearance
quite
as
if
it
were
due
to
the
bleaching
power
of
the
sun
on
the
fore
quarters
there
is
none
of
the
bright
straw
color
so
characteristic
of
the
adult
animal
along
the
top
of
the
neck
and
shoulders
however
this
color
has
at
last
begun
to
show
faintly
the
hair
on
the
body
is
quite
luxuriant
both
in
length
and
density
in
both
respects
quite
equaling
if
not
even
surpassing
that
of
the
finest
adults
for
example
the
hair
on
the
side
of
the
mounted
yearling
in
the
museum
group
has
a
length
of
to
inches
while
that
on
the

region
of
the
adult
bull
whose
pelage
is
particularly
fine
is
recorded
as
being
inches
only
the
horn
is
a
straight
conical
spike
from
to
inches
long
according
to
age
and
perfectly
black
the
legs
are
proportionally
longer
and
larger
in
the
joints
than
those
of
the
animal
the
countenance
of
the
yearling
is
quite
interesting
the
sleepy
helpless
innocent
expression
of
the
very
young
calf
has
given
place
to
a
mischievous
look
and
he
seems
ready
to
break
away

of

in

parlance
the
male
buffalo
between
the
yearling
age
and
four
years
is
called
a
spike
bull
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
up
to
the
latter
period
the
horn
is
a
spike
either
perfectly
straight
or
with
a
curve
near
its
base
and
a
straight
point
the
rest
of
the
way
up
the
curve
of
the
horn
is
generally
hidden
in
the
hair
and
the
only
part
visible
is
the
straight
terminal
spike
usually
the
spike
points
diverge
from
each
other
but
often
they
are
parallel
and
also
perpendicular
in
the
fourth
year
however
the
points
of
the
horns
begin
to
curve
inward
toward
each
other
describing
equal
arcs
of
the
same
circle

if
they
were
going
to
meet
over
the
top
of
the

the
handsome
young
spike
bull
in
the
museum

the
hair
on
the
shoulders
has
begun
to
take
on
the
length
the
light
color
and
tufted
appearance
of
the

the
highest
point
of

the

doubled

reveal
the
character
of
the
growth

may
be
finally
expected
the

has
greatly
lengthened

the
hair

all
other
portions
of

the
spike
period
of
a
buffalo
is
a
most
interesting
one
like
a
boy
the
young
bull
shows
his
youth
in
so
many
ways
it
is
always
conspicuous
and
his
countenance
is
so
suggestive
of
a
youth
it
fixes
the
interest
to
a
marked
degree
he
is
active
alert
and
suspicious
and
when
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
run
the
hunter
may
as
well
give
up
the
chase

a
strange
fatality
our
spike
bull
appears
to
be
the
only
one
in
any
museum

even
in
preserved
existence
as
far
as
can
be
ascertained
out
of
the
buffaloes
killed

it
is
to
be
sincerely
regretted
that
more
specimens
representing
this
very
interesting
period
of
the

not

reproduced

by

it
must
be
observed
at
this
point
that
in
many
respects
this
animal
is
an
exceptionally
fine
one
in
actual
size
of
frame
and
in
quantity
and
quality
of
pelage
it
is
far
superior
to
the
average
even
of
wild
buffaloes
when
they
were
most
numerous
and
at
their
best
in
one
respect
however
that
of
actual
bulk
it
is
believed
that
this
specimen
may
have
often
been
surpassed
when
buffaloes
were
numerous
and
not
required
to
do
any
great
amount
of
running
in
order
to
exist
they
were
in
the
autumn
months
very
fat
audubon
says
a
large
bison
bull
will
generally
weigh
nearly
pounds
and
a
fat
cow
about
pounds
we
weighed
one
of
the
bulls
killed
by
our
party
and
found
it
to
reach
pounds
although
it
had
already
lost
a
good
deal
of
blood
this
was
an
old
bull
and
not
fat
it
had
probably
weighed
more
at
some
previous
period
our
specimen
when
killed
by
the
writer
december
was
in
full
vigor
superbly
muscled
and
well
fed
but
he
carried
not
a
single
pound
of
fat
for
years
the
race
for
life
had
utterly
prevented
the
secretion
of
useless
and
cumbersome
fat
and
his
subsistence
had
gone
toward
the
development
of
useful
muscle
having
no
means
by
which
to
weigh
him
we
could
only
estimate
his
weight
in
which
i
called
for
the
advice
of
my
cowboys
all
of
whom
were
more
or
less
familiar
with
the
weight
of
range
cattle
and
one
i
regarded
as
an
expert
at
first
the
estimated
weight
of
the
animal
was
fixed
at
pounds
but
with
a
constitutional
fear
of
estimating
over
the
truth
i
afterward
reduced
it
to
pounds
this
i
am
now
well
convinced
was
an
error
for
i
believe
the
first
figure
to
have
been
nearer
the
truth

my
dear
professor
on
the
receipt
of
your
letter
of
the
instant
i
saw
general
sheridan
and
yesterday
we
called
on
your
taxidermist
and
examined
the
buffalo
bull
he
is
setting
up
for
the
museum
i
do
think
i
have
ever
seen
a
more
splendid
specimen
in
my
life
general
sheridan
and
i
have
seen
millions
of
buffalo
on
the
plains
in
former
times
i
have
killed
hundreds
but
i
never
killed
a
larger
animal
than
the
one

the
possession
of

in
mounting
the

of

we
endeavored
by
every
means
in
our
power
foremost
of
which
were
three
different
sets
of
measurements
taken
from
the
dead
animal
one
set
to
check
another
to
reproduce
him

mounted
in
exactly
the

he
possessed
in
life
muscular
but
not
fat
the
color
of
the

and
hindquarters
of
a

is
very
peculiar

once
saw
a
competent
artist
experiment
with
his
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
finally
struck
the
combination
which
exactly
matched
the
side
of
our
large
bull
to
my
eyes
the
color
is
a
pale
or
smoky
gray
the
range
of
individual
variation
is
considerable
some
being
uniformly
darker
than
the
average
type
and
others
lighter
while
the
under
parts
of
most
adults
are
dark
brown
or
blackish
brown
others
are
actually
black
the
hair
on
the
body
and
hinder
parts
is
fine
wavy
on
the
outside
and
woolly
underneath
and
very
dense
add
to
this
the
thickness
of
the
skin
itself
and
the
combination
forms
a
covering
that
is
almost
impervious
to
cold
the
entire
fore
quarter
region
the
shoulders
the
hump
and
the
upper
part
of
the
neck
is
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
pale
yellow
hair
naples
yellow
yellow
ocher
which
stands
straight
out
in
a
dense
mass
disposed
in
handsome
tufts
the
hair
is
somewhat
woolly
in
its
nature
and
the
ends
are
as
even
as
if
the
whole
mass
had
lately
been
gone
over
with
shears
and
carefully
clipped
this
hair
is
inches
in
length
as
the
living
animal
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
the
hair
parted
in
great
vertical
furrows
so
deep
that
the
skin
itself
seemed
almost
in
sight
as
before
remarked
to
comb
this
hair
would
utterly
destroy
its
naturalness
and
it
should
never
be
done
under
any
circumstances
standing
as
it
does
between
the
darker
hair
of
the
body
on
one
side
and
the
almost
black
mass
of
the
head
on
the
other
this
light
area
is
rendered
doubly
striking
and
conspicuous
by
contrast
it
not
only
covers
the
shoulders
but
extends
back
upon
the
thorax
where
it
abruptly
terminates
on
a
line
corresponding
to
the
sixth
rib
from
the
downward
the
color
shades
gradually
into
a
dark
brown
until
at
the
knee
it
becomes
quite
black
the
huge
is
lost
in
a
thick
mass
of
long
coarse
and
rather
straight
hair
inches
in
length
this
growth
stops
abruptly
at
the
knee
but
it
hangs
within
inches
of
the
hoof
the
front
side
of
this
mass
is
blackish
brown
but
it
rapidly
shades
backward
and
downward
into
the
hair
on
the
top
of
the
head

in
a
dense
matted
mass
forming
a
perfect
crown

rich
brown
burnt

hanging
over
the
eyes
almost
enveloping
both
horns
and
spreading
back
in
rich
dark
masses
upon
the
neck
on
the
cheeks
the
hair
is
of
the
same
blackish
brown
color
but
comparatively
short
and
lies
in
beautiful
waves
on
the
bridge
of
the
nose
the
hair
is
about
inches
in
length
and
stands
out
in
a
thick
uniform
very
curly
mass
which
always
looks
as
if
it
had
just
been
carefully
combed
immediately
around
the
nose
and
mouth
the
hair
is
very
short
straight
and
stiff
and
lies
close
to
the
skin
which
leaves
the
nostrils
and
lips
fully
exposed
the
front
part
of
the
chin
is
similarly
clad
and
its
form
is
perfectly
flat
due
to
the
habit
of
the
animal
in
feeding
upon
the
short
crisp
buffalo
grass

the

of

the

is

the

are
stated
to
be
the

the
buffalo
of

many
old
hunters
with
whom
i
have
conversed
on
this
subject
aver
that
the
wood
buffalo
is
a
distinct
species
and
although
they
are
not
able
to
offer
scientific
proofs
yet
the
difference
in

animals
in

and
the
varieties
which
are
frequently
met
with
in

herds
still
cling
to
this
opinion
the
buffalo
of
the
plains
are
not
always
of
the
dark
and

bright
brown
which
forms
their
characteristic
color
they
are

by
the

a

close
resemblance
to
the

the
lithuanian

judging
from
the
specimens
of
that
species
which
i
have
since
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
in

the

to

very
scarce

found
north

on

it
never
ventures
into
the
open
plains
the
prairie
buffalo
on
the
contrary
generally
avoids
the
woods
in
summer
and
keeps
to
the
open
country
but
in
winter
they
are
frequently
found
in
the
woods
of
the
little

the

is
no

that
formerly
the

ranged

me
as
follows
in
a
letter
dated
october
in
our
district
of
athabasca
along
the
salt
river
there
are
still
a
few
wood
buffalo
killed
every
year

they
are
fast
diminishing
in
numbers

are
also
becoming
very
shy
in

the

there
occurs
the
following
reference
to
the
wood
buffalo
in
the
winter
of
the
last
buffalo
were
killed
north
of
peace
river
but
in
about
one
thousand
head
were
still
in
existence
between
the
athabasca
and
peace
rivers
north
of
little
slave
lake
these
are
called
wood
buffalo
by
the
hunters
but
diner
only
in
size
from
those
of
the
plain
in
the
absence
of
facts
based
on
personal
observations
i
may
be
permitted
to
advance
an
opinion
in
regard
to
the
wood
buffalo
there
is
some
reason
for
the
belief
that
certain
changes
of
form
may
have
taken
place
in
the
buffaloes
that
have
taken
up
a
permanent
residence
in
rugged
and
precipitous
mountain
regions
indeed
it
is
hardly
possible
to
understand
how
such
a
radical
change
in
the
habitat
of
an
animal
could
fail
through
successive
generations
to
effect
certain
changes
in
the
animal
itself
it
seems
to
me
that
the
changes
which
would
take
place
in
a
band
of
plains
buffaloes
transferred
to
a
permanent
mountain
habitat
can
be
forecast
with
a
marked
degree
of
certainty
the
changes
that
take
place
under
such
conditions
in
cattle
swine
and
goats
are
well
known
and
similar
causes
would
certainly
produce
similar
results
in
the
buffalo
the
scantier
feed
of
the
mountains
and
the
great
waste
of
vital
energy
called
for
in
procuring
it
would
hardly
produce
a
larger
buffalo
than
the
animal
who
acquires
an
abundance
of
daily
food
of
the
best
quality
with
but
little
effort
we
should
expect
to
see
the
mountain
buffalo
smaller
in
body
than
the
plains
animal
with
better
leg
development
and
particularly
with
stronger
hind
quarters
the
pelvis
of
the
plains
buffalo
is
surprisingly
small
and
weak
for
so
large
an
animal
beyond
question
constant
mountain
climbing
is
bound
to
develop
a
maximum
of
useful
muscle
and
bone
and
a
minimum
of
useless
fat
if
the
loss
of
mane
sustained
by
the
african
lions
who
live
in
bushy
localities
may
be
taken
as
an
index
we
should
expect
the
bison
of
the
mountains
especially
the
wood
buffalo
to
lose
a
great
deal
of
his
shaggy
frontlet
and
mane
on
the
bushes
and
trees
which
surrounded
him
therefore
we
would
naturally
expect
to
find
the
hair
on
those
parts
shorter
and
in
far
less
perfect
condition
than
on
the
bison
of
the
treeless
prairies
by
reason
of
the
more
shaded
condition
of
his
home
and
the
decided
mitigation
of
the
fierceness
we
should
also
expect
to
see
his
entire
pelage
of
a
darker
tone
that
he
would
acquire
a
degree
of
agility
and
strength
unknown
in
his
relative
of
the
plain
is
reasonably
certain
in
the
course
of
many
centuries
the
change
in
his
form
might
become
well
defined
constant
and
conspicuous
but
at
present
there
is
apparently
not
the
slightest
ground
for
considering
that
the
mountain
buffalo
or
wood
buffalo
is
entitled
to
rank
even
as
a
variety
of
colonel

recorded
some
very
interesting
information
in

to
the

be
quoted

note
plains
of
the
great
west
p
in
various
portions
of
the
rocky
mountains
especially
in
the
region
of
the
parks
is
found
an
animal
which
old
mountaineers
call
the
this
animal
bears
about
the
same
relation
to
a
plains
buffalo
as
a
sturdy
mountain
pony
does
to
an
american
horse
his
body
is
lighter
whilst
his
legs
are
shorter
but
much
thicker
and
stronger
than
the
plains
animal
thus
enabling
him
to
perform
feats
of
climbing
and
tumbling
almost
incredible
in
such
a
huge
and
apparently
unwieldy
beast
these
animals
are
by
no
means
plentiful
and
are
moreover
excessively
shy
inhabiting
the
deepest
darkest
defiles
or
the
craggy
almost
precipitous
sides
of
mountains
inaccessible
to
any
but
the
most
practiced
mountaineers
from
the
tops
of
the
mountains
which
rim
the
parks
the
rains
of
ages
have
cut
deep
gorges
which
plunge
with
brusque
abruptness
but
nevertheless
with
great
regularity
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
feet
to
the
valley
below
down
the
bottom
of
each
such
gorge
a
clear
cold
stream
of
purest
water
fertilizing
a
narrow
belt
of
a
few
feet
of
alluvial
and
giving
birth
and
growth
to
a
dense
jungle
of
spruce
quaking
asp
and
other
mountain
trees
one
side
of
the
gorge
is
generally
a
thick
forest
of
pine
while
the
other
side
is
a
park
covered
with
splendid
grass
such
gorges
are
the
favorite
haunt
of
the
mountain
buffalo
early
in
the
morning
he
enjoys
a
bountiful
breakfast
of
the
rich
nutritious
grasses
quenches
his
thirst
with
the
finest
water
and
retiring
just
within
the
line
of
jungle
where
himself
unseen
he
can
scan
the
open
he
crouches
himself
in
the
long
grass
and
reposes
in
comfort
and
security
until
appetite
calls
him
to
his
dinner
late
in
the
evening
unlike
their
plains
relative
there
is
no
stupid
staring
at
an
intruder
at
the
first
symptom
of
danger
they
disappear
like
magic
in
the
thicket
and
never
stop
until
far
removed
from
even
the
apprehension
of
pursuit
i
have
many
times
come
upon
their
fresh
tracks
upon
the
beds
from
which
they
had
first
sprung
in
alarm
but
i
have
never
even
seen
one
i
have
wasted
much
time
and
a
great
deal
of
wind
in
vain
endeavors
to
add
one
of
these
animals
to
my
bag
my
figure
is
no
longer
adapted
to
mountain
climbing
and
the
possession
of
a
bison
head
of
my
own
killing
is
one
of
my
blighted
hopes
several
of
my
friends
have
been
more
fortunate
but
i
know
of
no
sportsman
who
has
bagged
more
than
one
note
by
william
blackmore
the
author
is
in
error
here
as
in
a
point
of
the
tarryall
range
of
mountains
between
pike
peak
and
the
south
park
in
the
autumn
of
two
mountain
buffaloes
were
killed
in
one
afternoon
the
skin
of
the
finer
was
presented
to
frank
buckland
old
mountaineers
and
trappers
have
given
me
wonderful
accounts
of
the
number
of
these
animals
in
all
the
mountain
region
years
ago
and
i
have
been
informed
by
them
that
their
present
rarity
is
due
to
the
great
of
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
as
destroying
the
plains
buffalo
in
the
laramie
country
one
of
my
friends
a
most
ardent
and
pertinacious
sportsman
determined
on
the
possession
of
a
bison
head
and
hiring
a
guide
plunged
into
the
mountain
wilds
which
separate
the
middle
from
south
park
after
several
days
fresh
tracks
were
discovered
turning
their
horses
loose
on
a
little
gorge
park
such
as
described
they
started
on
foot
on
the
trail
for
all
that
day
they
toiled
and
scrambled
with
the
utmost
caution
now
up
now
down
through
deep
and
narrow
gorges
and
pine
thickets
over
bare
and
rocky
crags
sleeping
where
night
overtook
them
betimes
next
morning
they
pushed
on
the
trail
and
about
when
both
were
exhausted
and
disheartened
their
route
was
intercepted
by
a
precipice
looking
over
they
descried
on
a
projecting
ledge
several
hundred
feet
below
a
herd
of
about
bisons
lying
down
the
ledge
was
about
feet
at
widest
by
probably
feet
long
its
inner
boundary
was
the
wall
of
rock
on
the
top
of
which
they
stood
its
outer
appeared
to
be
a
sheer
precipice
of
at
least
feet
this
ledge
was
connected
with
the
slope
of
the
mountain
by
a
narrow
neck
the
wind
being
right
the
hunters
succeeded
in
reaching
this
neck
unobserved
my
friend
selected
a
magnificent
head
that
of
a
fine
bull
young
but
full
grown
and
both
fired
at
the
report
the
bisons
all
ran
to
the
far
end
of
the
ledge
and
plunged
over
terribly
disappointed
the
hunters
ran
to
the
spot
and
found
that
they
had
gone
down
a
declivity
not
actually
a
precipice
but
so
steep
that
the
hunters
could
not
follow
them
at
the
foot
lay
a
bison
a
long
a
fatiguing
detour
brought
them
to
the
spot
and
in
the
animal
lying
dead
before
him
my
friend
recognized
his
bull
his
first
and
last
mountain
buffalo
hone
but
a
true
sportsman
can
appreciate
his
feelings
the
remainder
of
the
herd
was
never
seen
after
the
great
plunge
down
which
it
is
doubtful
if
even
a
dog
could
have
followed
unharmed
in
the
issue
of
forest
and
stream
of
june
shufeldt
in
an
article
entitled
the
american
buffalo
relates
a
very
interesting
experience
with
buffaloes
which
were
pronounced
to
be
of
the
mountain
variety
and
his
observations
on
the
animals
are
well
worth
reproducing
here
the
animals
eight
in
number
were
encountered
on
the
northern
slope
of
the
big
horn
mountains
in
the
autumn
of
we
came
upon
them
during
a
fearful
blizzard
of
heavy
hail
during
which
our
animals
could
scarcely
retain
their
feet
in
fact
the
packer
mule
absolutely
lay
down
on
the
ground
rather
than
risk
being
blown
down
the
mountain
side
and
my
own
horse
totally
unable
to
face
such
a
violent
blow
and
the
pelting
hail
the
stones
being
as
large
as
big
marbles
positively
stood
facing
an
old
buffalo
bull
that
was
not
more
than
feet
in
front
of
me
strange
to
say
this
fearful
gust
did
not
last
more
than
ten
minutes
when
it
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
commenced
and
i
deliberately
killed
my
old
buffalo
at
one
shot
just
where
he
stood
and
separating
two
other
bulls
from
the
rest
charged
them
down
a
rugged
ravine
they
passed
over
this
and
into
another
one
but
with
less
precipitous
sides
and
no
trees
in
the
way
and
when
i
was
on
top
of
the
intervening
ridge
i
noticed
that
the
largest
bull
had
halted
in
the
bottom
checking
my
horse
an
excellent
buffalo
hunter
i
fired
down
at
him
without
dismounting
the
ball
merely
barked
his
shoulder
and
to
my
infinite
surprise
he
turned
and
charged
me
up
the
hill
stepping
to
one
side
of
my
horse
with
the
charging
and
infuriated
bull
not
feet
to
my
front
i
fired
upon
him
and
the
heavy
ball
took
him
square
in
the
chest
bringing
him
to
his
knees
with
a
gush
of
scarlet
blood
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
upon
examining
the
specimen
i
found
it
to
be
an
old
bull
apparently
smaller
and
very
much
blacker
than
the
ones
i
had
seen
killed
on
the
plains
only
a
day
or
so
before
then
i
examined
the
first
one
i
had
shot
as
well
as
others
which
were
killed
by
the
packer
from
the
same
bunch
and
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
typical
representatives
of
the
variety
known
as
the
buffalo
a
form
much
more
active
in
movement
of
slighter
limbs
blacker
and
far
more
dangerous
to
attack
my
opinion
in
the
premises
remains
unaltered
in
all
this
i
may
be
mistaken
but
it
was
also
the
opinion
held
by
the
old
buffalo
hunter
who
accompanied
me
and
who
at
once
remarked
when
he
saw
them
that
they
were
buffalo
and
not
the
plains
variety
these
specimens
were
not
actually
measured
by
me
in
either
case
and
their
being
considered
smaller
only
rested
upon
my
judging
them
by
my
eye
but
they
were
of
a
softer
pelage
black
lighter
in
limb
and
when
discovered
were
in
the
timber
on
the
side
of
the
big
horn
mountains
the
band
of
bison
in
the
yellowstone
park
must
of
necessity
be
of
the
wood
or
mountain
variety
and
if
by
any
chance
one
of
its
members
ever
dies
of
old
age
it
is
to
be
hoped
its
skin
may
be
carefully
preserved
and
sent
to
the
national
museum
to
throw
some
further
light
on
this
question
shedding
of
the
winter
in
personal
appearance
the
buffalo
is
subject
to
striking
and
even
painful
variations
and
the
estimate
an
observer
forms
of
him
is
very
apt
to
depend
upon
the
time
of
the
year
at
which
the
observation
is
made
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
the
whole
coat
has
become
faded
and
bleached
by
the
action
of
the
sun
wind
snow
and
rain
until
the
freshness
of
its
late
autumn
colors
has
totally
disappeared
the
bison
takes
on
a
seedy
weathered
and
rusty
look
but
this
is
not
a
circumstance
to
what
happens
to
him
a
little
later
promptly
with
the
coming
of
the
spring
if
not
even
in
the
last
week
of
february
the
buffalo
begins
the
shedding
of
his
winter
coat
it
is
a
long
and
difficult
task
and
with
commendable
energy
he
sets
about
it
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
it
lasts
him
more
than
half
the
year
and
is
attended
with
many
positive
discomforts
the
process
of
shedding
is
accomplished
in
two
ways
by
the
new
hair
growing
into
and
forcing
off
the
old
and
by
the
old
hair
falling
off
in
great
patches
leaving
the
skin
bare
on
the
portions
the
head
neck
fore
quarters
and
hump
the
old
hair
stops
growing
dies
and
the
new
hair
immediately
starts
through
the
skin
and
forces
it
off
the
new
hair
grows
so
rapidly
and
at
the
same
time
so
densely
that
it
forces
itself
into
the
old
becomes
hopelessly
entangled
with
it
and
in
time
actually
lifts
the
old
hair
clear
of
the
skin
on
the
head
the
new
hair
is
dark
brown
or
black
but
on
the
neck
fore
quarters
and
hump
it
has
at
first
and
indeed
until
it
is
inches
in
length
a
peculiar
gray
or
drab
color
mixed
with
brown
totally
different
from
its
final
and
natural
color
the
new
hair
starts
first
on
the
head
but
the
actual
shedding
of
the
old
hair
is
to
be
seen
first
along
the
lower
parts
of
the
neck
and
between
the
fore
legs
the
parts
are
never
bare
but
on
the
contrary
the
amount
of
hair
upon
them
is
about
the
same
all
the
year
round
the
old
and
the
new
hair
cling
together
with
provoking
tenacity
long
after
the
old
coat
should
fall
and
on
several
of
the
bulls
we
killed
in
october
there
were
patches
of
it
still
sticking
tightly
to
the
shoulders
from
which
it
had
to
be
forcibly
plucked
away
under
all
such
patches
the
new
hair
was
of
a
different
color
from
that
around
them
the
other
process
of
shedding
takes
place
on
the
body
and
hind
quarters
from
which
the
old
hair
loosens
and
drops
off
in
great
woolly
flakes
a
foot
square
more
or
less
the
shedding
takes
place
very
unevenly
the
old
hair
remaining
much
longer
in
some
places
than
in
others
during
april
may
and
june
the
body
and
hind
quarters
present
a
most
ludicrous
and
even
pitiful
spectacle
the
patches
of
persistent
old
hair
alternating
with
patches
of
bare
brown
skin
are
adorned
by
great
ragged
streamers
of
loose
hair
which
flutter
in
the
wind
like
signals
of
distress
whoever
sees
a
bison
at
this
period
is
filled
with
a
desire
to
assist
nature
by
plucking
off
the
flying
streamers
of
old
hair
but
the
bison
never
permits
anything
of
the
kind
however
good
one
intentions
may
be
all
efforts
to
dislodge
the
old
hair
are
resisted
to
the
last
extremity
and
the
buffalo
generally
acts
as
if
the
intention
were
to
deprive
him
of
his
skin
itself
by
the
end
of
june
if
not
before
the
body
and
hind
quarters
are
free
from
the
old
hair
and
as
bare
as
the
hide
of
a
hippopotamus
the
naked
skin
has
a
shiny
brown
appearance
and
of
course
the
external
anatomy
of
the
animal
is
very
distinctly
revealed
but
for
the
long
hair
on
the
fore
quarters
neck
and
head
the
bison
would
lose
all
his
dignity
of
appearance
with
his
hair
as
it
is
the
handsome
black
head
which
is
black
with
new
hair
as
early
as
the
first
of
may
redeems
the
animal
from
utter
homeliness
after
the
shedding
of
the
body
hair
the
naked
skin
of
the
buffalo
is
burned
by
the
sun
and
bitten
by
flies
until
he
is
compelled
to
seek
a
pool
of
water
or
even
a
bed
of
soft
mud
in
which
to
roll
and
make
himself
comfortable
he
wallows
not
so
much
because
he
is
so
fond
of
either
water
or
mud
but
in
and
when
he
emerges
from
his
wallow
plastered
with
mud
from
head
to
tail
his
degradation
is
complete
he
is
then
simply
not
fit
to
be
seen
even
by
his
best
friends
by
the
first
of
october
a
complete
and
wonderful
transformation
has
taken
place
the
buffalo
stands
forth
clothed
in
a
complete
new
suit
of
hair
fine
clean
sleek
and
bright
in
color
not
a
speck
of
dirt
nor
a
lock
awry
anywhere
to
be
sure
it
is
as
yet
a
trifle
short
on
the
body
where
it
is
not
over
an
inch
in
length
and
hardly
that
but
it
is
growing
rapidly
and
getting
ready
for
winter
from
the
of
november
to
the
of
december
the
pelage
is
at
its
very
finest
by
the
former
date
it
has
attained
its
full
growth
its
colors
are
at
their
brightest
and
nothing
has
been
lost
either
by
the
elements
or
by
accidental
causes
to
him
who
sees
an
adult
bull
at
this
period
or
near
it
the
grandeur
of
the
animal
is
irresistibly
felt
after
seeing
buffaloes
of
all
ages
in
the
spring
and
summer
months
the
contrast
afforded
by
those
seen
in
october
november
and
december
was
most
striking
and
impressive
in
the
later
period
as
different
individuals
were
wounded
and
brought
to
bay
at
close
quarters
their
hair
was
so
clean
and
that
more
than
once
i
was
led
to
exclaim
he
looks
as
if
he
had
just
been
combed
it
must
be
remarked
however
that
the
long
hair
of
the
head
and
fore
quarters
is
disposed
in
locks
or
tufts
and
to
comb
it
in
reality
would
utterly
destroy
its
natural
and
characteristic
appearance
inasmuch
as
the
pelage
of
the
domesticated
bison
the
only
representatives
of
the
species
which
will
be
found
alive
ten
years
hence
will
in
all
likelihood
develop
differently
from
that
of
the
wild
animal
it
may
some
time
in
the
future
be
of
interest
to
know
the
length
by
careful
measurement
of
the
hair
found
on
typical
wild
specimens
to
this
end
the
following
measurements
are
given
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
specimens
were
not
chosen
because
their
pelage
was
particularly
luxuriant
but
rather
because
they
are
fine
average
specimens
the
hair
of
the
adult
bull
is
by
no
means
as
long
as
i
have
seen
on
a
bison
although
perhaps
not
many
have
greatly
surpassed
it
it
is
with
the
lower
animals
as
with
man
the
length
of
the
hairy
covering
is
an
individual
character
only
i
have
in
my
possession
a
tuft
of
hair
from
the
frontlet
of
a
rather
small
bull
bison
which
measures
inches
in
length
the
beard
on
the
specimen
from
which
this
came
was
correspondingly
long
and
the
entire
pelage
was
of
wonderful
length
and
density

cases
of
albinism
in
the
buffalo
were
of
extremely
rare
occurrence
i
have
met
many
old
buffalo
hunters
who
had
killed
thousands
and
seen
scores
of
thousands
of
buffaloes
yet
never
had
seen
a
white
one
from
all
accounts
it
appears
that
not
over
ten
or
eleven
white
buffaloes
or
white
buffalo
skins
were
ever
seen
by
white
men
pied
individuals
were
occasionally
obtained
but
even
they
were
rare
albino
buffaloes
were
always
so
highly
prized
that
not
a
single
one
so
far
as
i
can
learn
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
attain
adult
size
their
appearance
being
so
striking
in
contrast
with
the
other
members
of
the
herd
as
to
draw
upon
them
an
unusual
number
of
enemies
and
cause
their
speedy
destruction
at
the
new
orleans
exposition
in
the
territory
of
dakota
exhibited
amongst
other
western
quadrupeds
the
mounted
skin
of
a
buffalo
which
might
fairly
be
called
an
albino
although
not
really
white
it
was
of
a
uniform
dirty
and
showed
not
a
trace
of
the
bison
normal
color
on
any
part
of
its
body
lieut
kellogg
army
has
on
deposit
in
the
national
museum
a
tanned
skin
which
is
said
to
have
come
from
a
buffalo
it
is
from
an
animal
about
one
year
old
and
the
hair
upon
it
which
is
short
very
curly
or
wavy
and
rather
coarse
is
pure
white
in
length
and
texture
the
hair
does
not
in
any
one
respect
resemble
the
hair
of
a
yearling
buffalo
save
in
one
particular
along
the
median
line
of
the
neck
and
hump
there
is
a
rather
long
thin
mane
of
hair
which
has
the
peculiar
woolly
appearance
of
genuine
buffalo
hair
on
those
parts
on
the
shoulder
portions
of
the
skin
the
hair
is
as
short
as
on
the
hind
quarters
i
am
inclined
to
believe
this
rather
remarkable
specimen
came
from
a
wild
calf
the
result
of
a
cross
between
a
white
domestic
cow
and
a
buffalo
bull
at
one
time
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
for
small
bunches
of
domestic
cattle
to
enter
herds
of
buffalo
and
remain
there
permanently
i
have
been
informed
that
the
late
general
marcy
possessed
a
white
buffalo
skin
if
it
is
still
in
existence
and
is
really
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
so
great
a
rarity
may
find
a
permanent
abiding
place
in
some
museum
where
the
remains
of
are
properly
appreciated
the
habits
of
the
buffalo
the
history
of
the
buffalo
daily
life
and
habits
should
begin
with
the
running
season
this
period
occupied
the
months
of
august
and
september
and
was
characterized
by
a
degree
of
excitement
and
activity
throughout
the
entire
herd
quite
foreign
to
the
and
even
slothful
nature
which
was
so
noticeable
a
feature
of
the
character
at
all
other
times
the
mating
season
occurred
when
the
herd
was
on
its
summer
range
the
spring
calves
were
from
two
to
four
months
old
through
continued
feasting
on
the
new
crop
of
and
the
most
nutritious
in
the
world
perhaps
every
buffalo
in
the
herd
had
grown
fat
and
vigorous
the
faded
and
suit
of
winter
hair
had
by
that
time
fallen
off
and
given
place
to
the
new
coat
of
dark
gray
and
black
and
excepting
for
the
shortness
of
his
hair
the
buffalo
was
in
prime
condition
during
the
running
season
as
it
was
called
by
the
plainsmen
the
whole
nature
of
the
herd
was
completely
changed
instead
of
being
broken
up
into
countless
small
groups
and
dispersed
over
a
vast
extent
of
territory
the
herd
came
together
in
a
dense
and
confused
mass
of
many
thousand
individuals
so
closely
congregated
as
to
actually
blacken
the
face
of
the
landscape
as
if
by
a
general
and
irresistible
impulse
every
straggler
would
be
drawn
to
the
common
center
and
for
miles
on
every
side
of
the
great
herd
the
country
would
be
found
entirely
deserted
at
this
time
the
herd
itself
became
a
seething
mass
of
activity
and
excitement
as
usual
under
such
conditions
the
bulls
were
half
the
time
chasing
the
cows
and
fighting
each
other
during
the
other
half
these
actual
combats
which
were
always
of
short
duration
and
over
in
a
few
seconds
after
the
actual
collision
took
place
were
preceded
by
the
usual
threatening
demonstrations
in
which
the
bull
lowers
his
head
until
his
nose
almost
touches
the
ground
roars
like
a
until
the
earth
seems
to
fairly
tremble
with
the
vibration
glares
madly
upon
his
adversary
with
eyeballs
and
with
his
forefeet
paws
up
the
dry
earth
and
throws
it
upward
in
a
great
cloud
of
dust
high
above
his
back
at
such
times
the
mingled
roaring
it
can
not
truthfully
be
described
as
lowing
or
bellowing
of
a
number
of
huge
bulls
unite
and
form
a
great
volume
of
sound
like
distant
thunder
which
has
often
been
heard
at
a
distance
of
from
to
miles
i
have
even
been
assured
by
old
plainsmen
that
under
favorable
atmospheric
conditions
such
sounds
have
been
heard
five
miles
notwithstanding
the
extreme
frequency
of
combats
between
the
bulls
during
this
season
their
results
were
nearly
always
harmless
thanks
to
the
thickness
of
the
hair
and
hide
on
the
head
and
shoulders
and
the
strength
of
the
neck
under
no
conditions
was
there
ever
any
such
thing
as
the
pairing
off
or
mating
of
male
and
female
buffaloes
for
any
length
of
time
in
the
entire
process
of
reproduction
the
bison
habits
were
similar
to
those
of
domestic
cattle
for
years
the
opinion
was
held
by
many
in
some
cases
based
on
misinterpreted
observations
that
in
the
herd
the
identity
of
each
family
was
partially
preserved
and
that
each
old
bull
maintained
an
individual
harem
and
group
of
progeny
of
his
own
the
observations
of
colonel
dodge
completely
disprove
this
very
interesting
theory
for
at
best
it
was
only
a
picturesque
fancy
ascribing
to
the
bison
a
degree
of
intelligence
which
he
never
possessed
at
the
close
of
the
breeding
season
the
herd
quickly
settles
down
to
its
normal
condition
the
mass
gradually
resolves
itself
into
the
numerous
bands
or
herdlets
of
from
twenty
to
a
hundred
individuals
so
characteristic
of
bison
on
their
feeding
grounds
and
these
gradually
scatter
in
search
of
the
best
grass
until
the
herd
covers
many
square
miles
of
country
in
his
search
for
grass
the
buffalo
displayed
but
little
intelligence
or
power
of
original
thought
instead
of
closely
following
the
divides
between
water
courses
where
the
soil
was
best
and
grass
most
abundant
he
would
not
hesitate
to
wander
away
from
good
into
barren
bad
lands
covered
with
where
the
grass
was
very
thin
and
very
poor
in
such
broken
country
as
montana
wyoming
and
southwestern
dakota
the
herds
on
reaching
the
best
grazing
grounds
on
the
divides
would
graze
there
day
after
day
until
increasing
thirst
compelled
them
to
seek
for
water
then
actuated
by
a
common
impulse
the
search
for
a
was
begun
in
a
way
the
leader
of
a
herd
or
bunch
which
post
was
usually
filled
by
an
old
cow
would
start
off
down
the
nearest
draw
or
and
all
the
rest
would
fall
into
line
and
follow
her
from
the
moment
this
start
was
made
there
was
no
more
feeding
save
as
a
mouthful
of
grass
could
be
snatched
now
and
then
without
turning
aside
in
single
file
in
a
line
sometimes
half
a
mile
long
and
containing
between
one
and
two
hundred
buffaloes
the
procession
slowly
marched
down
the
coulée
close
alongside
the
gully
as
soon
as
the
began
to
cut
a
pathway
for
itself
when
the
gully
curved
to
right
or
left
the
leader
would
cross
its
bed
and
keep
straight
on
until
the
narrow
ditch
completed
its
wayward
curve
and
came
back
to
the
middle
of
the
coulée
the
trail
of
a
herd
in
search
of
water
is
usually
as
good
a
piece
of
engineering
as
could
be
executed
by
the
best
railway
surveyor
and
is
governed
by
precisely
the
same
principles
it
always
follows
the
level
of
the
valley
swerves
around
the
high
points
and
crosses
the
stream
repeatedly
in
order
to
avoid
climbing
up
from
the
level
the
same
trail
is
used
again
and
again
by
different
herds
until
the
narrow
path
not
over
a
foot
in
width
is
gradually
cut
straight
down
into
the
soil
to
a
depth
of
several
inches
as
if
it
had
been
done
by
a
by
the
time
the
trail
has
been
worn
down
to
a
depth
of
or
inches
without
having
its
width
increased
in
the
least
it
is
no
longer
a
pleasant
path
to
walk
in
being
too
much
like
a
narrow
ditch
then
the
buffaloes
abandon
it
and
strike
out
a
new
one
alongside
which
is
used
until
it
also
is
worn
down
and
abandoned
to
day
the
old
buffalo
trails
are
conspicuous
among
the
very
few
classes
of
objects
which
remain
as
a
reminder
of
a
vanished
race
the
herds
of
cattle
now
follow
them
in
single
file
just
as
the
buffaloes
did
a
few
years
ago
as
they
search
for
water
in
the
same
way
in
some
parts
of
the
west
in
certain
situations
old
buffalo
trails
exist
which
the
wild
herds
wore
down
to
a
depth
of
feet
or
more
mile
after
mile
marched
the
herd
straight
bound
for
the
upper
as
the
hot
summer
drew
on
the
pools
would
dry
up
one
by
one
those
nearest
the
source
being
the
first
to
disappear
toward
the
latter
part
of
summer
the
journey
for
water
was
often
a
long
one
hole
after
hole
would
be
passed
without
finding
a
drop
of
water
at
last
a
hole
of
mud
would
be
found
below
that
a
hole
with
a
little
muddy
water
and
a
mile
farther
on
the
leader
would
arrive
at
a
shallow
pool
under
the
edge
of
a
cut
bank
a
white
deposit
of
alkali
on
the
sand
encircling
its
margin
and
incrusting
the
blades
of
grass
and
rushed
that
grew
up
from
the
bottom
the
damp
earth
around
the
pool
was
cut
up
by
a
thousand
and
the
water
was
warm
strongly
impregnated
with
alkali
and
yellow
with
animal
impurities
but
it
was
the
nauseous
mixture
was
quickly
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
thirsty
heated
and
eager
buffaloes
of
all
ages
to
which
the
oldest
and
strongest
asserted
claims
of
priority
there
was
much
crowding
and
some
fighting
but
eventually
all
were
satisfied
after
such
a
long
journey
to
water
a
herd
would
usually
remain
by
it
for
some
hours
lying
down
resting
and
drinking
at
intervals
until
completely
satisfied
having
drunk
its
fill
the
herd
would
never
march
directly
back
to
the
choice
feeding
grounds
it
had
just
left
but
instead
would
leisurely
stroll
off
at
a
right
angle
from
the
course
it
came
cropping
for
awhile
the
rich
bunch
grasses
of
the
and
then
wander
across
the
hills
in
an
almost
aimless
search
for
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
when
buffaloes
remained
long
in
a
certain
locality
it
was
a
common
thing
for
them
to
visit
the
same
a
number
of
times
at
intervals
of
greater
or
less
duration
according
to
circumstances
when
undisturbed
on
his
chosen
range
the
bison
used
to
be
fond
of
lying
down
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
middle
of
the
day
particularly
when
fine
weather
and
good
grass
combined
to
encourage
him
in
luxurious
habits
i
once
discovered
with
the
field
glass
a
small
herd
of
buffaloes
lying
down
at
midday
on
the
slope
of
a
high
ridge
and
having
ridden
hard
for
several
hours
we
seized
the
opportunity
to
unsaddle
and
give
our
horses
an
hour
rest
before
making
the
attack
while
we
were
so
doing
the
herd
got
up
shifted
its
position
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
ridge
and
again
laid
down
every
buffalo
with
his
nose
pointing
to
windward
old
hunters
declare
that
in
the
days
of
their
abundance
when
feeding
on
their
ranges
in
fancied
security
the
younger
animals
were
as
playful
as
domestic
calves
it
was
a
common
thing
to
see
them
cavort
and
frisk
around
with
about
as
much
grace
as
young
elephants
prancing
and
running
to
and
fro
with
tails
held
high
in
air
like
scorpions
buffaloes
are
very
fond
of
rolling
in
dry
dirt
or
even
in
mud
and
this
habit
is
quite
strong
in
captive
animals
not
only
is
it
indulged
in
during
the
shedding
season
but
all
through
the
fall
and
winter
the
two
live
buffaloes
in
the
national
museum
are
so
much
given
to
rolling
even
in
rainy
weather
that
it
is
necessary
to
card
them
every
few
days
to
keep
them
presentable
bulls
are
much
more
given
to
rolling
than
the
cows
especially
after
they
have
reached
maturity
they
stretch
out
at
full
length
rub
their
heads
violently
to
and
fro
on
the
ground
in
which
the
horn
serves
as
the
chief
point
of
contact
and
slides
over
the
ground
like
a
after
thoroughly
scratching
one
side
on
mother
earth
they
roll
over
and
treat
the
other
in
like
manner
notwithstanding
his
sharp
and
lofty
hump
a
buffalo
bull
can
roll
completely
over
with
as
much
ease
as
any
horse
the
vast
amount
of
rolling
and
on
the
earth
indulged
in
by
bull
buffaloes
is
shown
in
the
worn
condition
of
the
horns
of
every
old
specimen

a
thickness
of
half
an
inch
is
gone
from
the
upper
half
of
each
horn
on
its
outside

at

point
the

throws
himself
flat
upon
his
side
and
forcing
himself
violently
around
with
his
horns
and
his
huge
hump
on
his
shoulders
presented
to
the
sides
he
ploughs
up
the
ground
by
his
rotary
motion
sinking
himself
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
ground
continually
enlarging
his
pool
in
which
he
at
length
becomes
nearly
immersed
and
the
water
and
mud
about
him
mixed
into
a
complete
mortar
which
changes
his
color
and
drips
in
streams
from
every
part
of
him
as
he
rises
up
upon
his
feet
a
hideous
monster
of
mud
and
ugliness
too
frightful
and
too
eccentric
to
be
described
it
is
generally
the
leader
of
the
herd
that
takes
upon
him
to
make
this
excavation
and
if
not
but
another
one
opens

the
leader
who
is
conqueror
marches
forward
and
driving
the
other
from
it

himself
into
it

having
cooled
his
sides
and
changed
his
color
to
a
walking
mass
of
mud
and

he
stands
in
the
pool
until
inclination
induces
him
to
step
out
and
give
place
to
the
next
in
command
who
stands
ready
and
another
and
another
who
advance
forward
in
their
turns
to
enjoy
the
luxury
of
the
wallow

the
whole
band
sometimes
a
hundred
or
more
will
pass
through
it
in
turn
each
one
throwing
his
body
around
in

similar
manner
and
each
one
adding
a
little
to
the
dimensions
of

while
he
carries
away
in
his
hair
an
equal
share
of
the
clay
which
dries
to
a
gray
or
whitish
color
and
gradually
falls
off
by
this
operation
which
is
done
perhaps
in
the
space
of
half
an
hour
a
circular
excavation
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
in
diameter
and
two
feet
in
depth
is
completed
and
left
for
the
water
to
run
into
which
soon
fills
it
to
the
level
of
the
ground
note
in
the
district
of
columbia
we
have
a
counterpart
of
this
in
the
public
wherein
forty
prisoners
were
seen
by
a
reporter
to
bathe
one
after
another
in
the
same
water
to
these
sinks
the
waters
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
prairies
are
continually
draining
and
in
them
lodging
their
vegetable
deposits
which
after
a
lapse
of
years
fill
them
up
to
the
surface
with
a
rich
soil
which
throws
up
an
unusual
growth
of
grass
and
herbage
forming
conspicuous
circles
which
arrest
the
eye
of
the
traveler
and
are
calculated
to
excite
his
surprise
for
ages
to
come
during
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
when
the
bison
inhabited
kentucky
and
pennsylvania
the
salt
springs
of
those
states
were
resorted
to
by
thousands
of
those
animals
who
drank
of
the
saline
waters
and
licked
the
impregnated
earth
thomas
ashe
affords
us
a
most
interesting
account
from
the
testimony
of
an
eye
witness
of
the
behavior
of
a
bison
at
a
salt
spring
the
description
refers
to
a
locality
in
western
pennsylvania
where
an
old
man
one
of
the
first
settlers
of
this
country
built
his
log
house
on
the
immediate
borders
of
a
salt
spring
he
informed
me
that
for
the
first
several
seasons
the
buffaloes
paid
him
their
visits
with
the
utmost
regularity
they
traveled
in
single
files
always
following
each
other
at
equal
distances
forming
droves
on
their
arrival
of
about
each
note
travels
in
america
in
london
the
first
and
second
years
so
unacquainted
were
these
poor
brutes
with
the
use
of
this
man
house
or
with
his
nature
that
in
a
few
hours
they
the
house
completely
down
taking
delight
in
turning
the
logs
off
with
their
horns
while
he
had
some
difficulty
to
escape
from
being
trampled
under
their
feet
or
crushed
to
death
in
his
own
ruins
at
that
period
he
supposed
there
could
not
have
been
less
than
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
spring
they
sought
for
no
manner
of
food
but
only
bathed
and
drank
three
or
four
times
a
day
and
rolled
in
the
earth
or
reposed
with
their
flanks
distended
in
the
adjacent
shades
and
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
separated
into
distinct
droves
bathed
drank
and
departed
in
single
files
according
to
the
exact
order
of
their
arrival
they
all
rolled
successively
in
the
same
hole
and
each
thus
carried
away
a
coat
of
mud
to
preserve
the
moisture
on
their
skin
and
which
when
hardened
and
baked
in
the
sun
would
resist
the
stings
of
millions
of
insects
that
otherwise
would
persecute
these
peaceful
travelers
to
madness
or
even
death
it
was
a
fixed
habit
with
the
great
buffalo
herds
to
move
southward
from
to
miles
at
the
approach
of
winter
sometimes
this
movement
was
accomplished
quietly
and
without
any
excitement
but
at
other
times
it
was
done
with
a
rush
in
which
considerable
distances
would
be
gone
over
on
the
double
quick
the
advance
of
a
herd
was
often
very
much
like
that
of
a
big
army
in
a
straggling
line
from
four
to
ten
animals
abreast
sometimes
the
herd
moved
forward
in
a
dense
mass
and
in
consequence
often
came
to
grief
in
quicksands
alkali
bogs
muddy
crossings
and
on
treacherous
ice
in
such
places
thousands
of
buffaloes
lost
their
lives
through
those
in
the
lead
being
forced
into
danger
by
pressure
of
the
mass
coming
behind
in
this
manner
in
the
summer
of
over
two
thousand
buffaloes
out
of
a
herd
of
about
four
thousand
lost
their
lives
in
the
quicksands
of
the
platte
river
near
plum
creek
while
attempting
to
cross
one
winter
a
herd
of
nearly
a
hundred
buffaloes
attempted
to
cross
a
lake
called
in
minnesota
upon
the
ice
which
gave
way
and
drowned
the
entire
herd
during
the
days
of
the
buffalo
it
was
a
common
thing
for
voyagers
on
the
missouri
river
to
see
buffaloes
hopelessly
mired
in
the
quicksands
or
mud
along
the
shore
either
dead
or
dying
and
to
find
their
dead
bodies
floating
down
the
river
or
lodged
on
the
upper
ends
of
the
islands
and
such
accidents
as
these
it
may
be
repeated
were
due
to
the
great
number
of
animals
and
the
momentum
of
the
moving
mass
the
forced
marches
of
the
great
herds
were
like
the
flight
of
a
routed
army
in
which
helpless
individuals
were
thrust
into
mortal
peril
by
the
irresistible
force
of
the
mass
coming
behind
which
rushes
blindly
on
after
their
leaders
in
this
way
it
was
possible
to
decoy
a
herd
toward
a
precipice
and
cause
it
to
plunge
over
en
masse
the
leaders
being
thrust
over
by
their
followers
and
all
the
rest
following
of
their
own
free
will
like
the
sheep
who
cheerfully
leaped
one
after
another
through
a
hole
in
the
side
of
a
high
bridge
because
their
did
so
but
it
is
not
to
be
understood
that
the
movement
of
a
great
herd
because
it
was
made
on
a
run
necessarily
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
stampede
in
which
a
herd
sweeps
forward
in
a
body
the
most
graphic
account
that
i
ever
obtained
of
facts
bearing
on
this
point
was
furnished
by
james
mcnaney
drawn
from
his
experience
on
the
northern
buffalo
range
in
his
party
reached
the
range
on
beaver
creek
about
miles
south
of
glendive
about
the
middle
of
november
and
found
buffaloes
already
there
in
fact
they
had
begun
to
arrive
from
the
north
as
early
as
the
middle
of
october
about
the
first
of
december
an
immense
herd
arrived
from
the
north
it
reached
their
vicinity
one
night
about
in
a
mass
that
seemed
to
spread
everywhere
as
the
hunters
sat
in
their
tents
loading
cartridges
and
cleaning
their
rifles
a
low
rumble
was
heard
which
gradually
increased
to
a
thundering
noise
and
some
one
exclaimed
there
that
a
big
herd
of
buffalo
coming
in
all
ran
out
immediately
and
hallooed
and
discharged
rifles
to
keep
the
buffaloes
from
running
over
their
tents
fortunately
the
horses
were
picketed
some
distance
away
in
a
grassy
coulée
which
the
buffaloes
did
not
enter
the
herd
came
at
a
jog
trot
and
moved
quite
rapidly
in
the
morning
the
whole
country
was
black
with
buffalo
it
was
estimated
that
head
were
in
sight
one
immense
detachment
went
down
on
to
a
flat
and
laid
down
there
it
remained
quietly
enjoying
a
long
rest
for
about
ten
days
it
gradually
broke
up
into
small
bands
which
strolled
off
in
various
directions
looking
for
food
and
which
the
hunters
quietly
attacked
a
still
more
striking
event
occurred
about
christmas
time
at
the
same
place
for
a
few
days
the
neighborhood
of
mcnaney
camp
had
been
entirely
deserted
by
buffaloes
not
even
one
remaining
but
one
morning
about
daybreak
a
great
herd
which
was
traveling
south
began
to
pass
their
camp
a
long
line
of
moving
forms
was
seen
advancing
rapidly
from
the
northwest
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
hunters
camp
it
disappeared
in
the
creek
valley
for
a
few
moments
and
presently
the
leaders
suddenly
came
in
sight
again
at
the
top
of
a
rise
a
few
hundred
yards
away
and
came
down
the
intervening
slope
at
full
speed
within
yards
of
the
two
tents
after
them
came
a
living
stream
of
followers
all
going
at
a
gallop
described
by
the
observer
as
a
long
lope
from
four
to
ten
buffaloes
abreast
sometimes
there
would
be
a
break
in
the
column
of
a
minute
duration
then
more
buffaloes
would
appear
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
the
column
went
rushing
by
as
before
the
calves
ran
with
their
mothers
and
the
young
stock
got
over
the
ground
with
much
less
exertion
than
the
older
animals
for
about
four
hours
or
until
past
did
this
column
of
buffaloes
gallop
past
the
camp
over
a
course
no
wider
than
a
village
street
three
miles
away
toward
the
south
the
long
dark
line
of
bobbing
humps
and
hind
quarters
wound
to
the
right
between
two
hills
and
disappeared
true
to
their
instincts
the
hunters
promptly
brought
out
their
rifles
and
began
to
fire
at
the
buffaloes
as
they
ran
a
furious
fusilade
was
kept
up
from
the
very
doors
of
the
tents
and
from
first
to
last
over
fifty
buffaloes
were
killed
some
fell
headlong
the
instant
they
were
hit
but
the
greater
number
ran
on
until
their
mortal
wounds
compelled
them
to
halt
draw
off
a
little
way
to
one
side
and
finally
fall
in
their
death
struggles
mcnaney
stated
that
the
hunters
estimated
the
number
of
buffaloes
that
of
the
range
that
winter
at
it
is
probable
and
in
fact
reasonably
certain
that
such
migrations
as
the
above
were
due
to
pastures
and
a
scarcity
of
food
on
the
more
northern
ranges
having
learned
that
a
journey
south
will
bring
him
to
regions
of
less
snow
and
more
grass
it
is
but
natural
that
so
lusty
a
traveler
should
migrate
the
herds
or
bands
which
started
south
in
the
fall
months
traveled
more
leisurely
with
frequent
halts
to
graze
on
rich
pastures
the
advance
was
on
a
very
different
plan
taking
place
in
straggling
lines
and
small
groups
dispersed
over
quite
a
scope
of
country
unless
closely
pursued
the
buffalo
never
chose
to
make
a
journey
of
several
miles
through
hilly
country
on
a
continuous
run
even
when
fleeing
from
the
attack
of
a
hunter
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
notice
that
if
the
hunter
was
a
mile
behind
the
buffalo
would
always
walk
when
going
uphill
but
as
soon
as
the
crest
was
gained
he
would
begin
to
run
and
go
down
the
slope
either
at
a
gallop
or
a
swift
trot
in
former
times
when
the
buffalo
world
was
wide
when
retreating
from
an
attack
he
always
ran
against
the
wind
to
avoid
running
upon
a
new
danger
which
showed
that
he
depended
more
upon
his
sense
of
smell
than
his
during
the
last
years
of
his
existence
however
this
habit
almost
totally
disappeared
and
the
harried
survivors
learned
to
run
for
the
regions
which
offered
the
greatest
safety
but
even
if
a
texas
hunter
should
go
into
the
staked
plains
and
descry
in
the
distance
a
body
of
animals
running
against
the
wind
he
would
without
a
moment
hesitation
pronounce
them
buffaloes
and
the
chances
are
that
he
would
be
right
in
winter
the
buffalo
used
to
face
the
storms
instead
of
turning
tail
and
drifting
before
them
helplessly
as
domestic
cattle
do
but
at
the
same
time
when
beset
by
a
blizzard
he
would
wisely
seek
shelter
from
it
in
some
narrow
and
deep
valley
or
system
of
ravines
there
the
herd
would
lie
down
and
wait
patiently
for
the
storm
to
cease
after
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
the
place
to
find
the
buffalo
was
in
the
flats
and
creek
bottoms
where
the
tall
rank
showed
their
tops
above
the
snow
and
afforded
the
best
and
almost
the
only
food
obtainable
when
the
was
unusually
heavy
and
lay
for
a
long
time
on
the
ground
the
buffalo
was
forced
to
fast
for
days
together
and
sometimes
even
weeks
if
a
warm
day
came
and
thawed
the
upper
surface
of
the
snow
sufficiently
for
succeeding
cold
to
freeze
it
into
a
crust
the
outlook
for
the
bison
began
to
be
serious
a
man
can
travel
over
a
crust
through
which
the
hoofs
of
a
ponderous
bison
cut
like
chisels
and
leave
him
floundering
it
was
at
such
times
that
the
indians
hunted
him
on
and
drove
their
spears
into
his
vitals
as
he
wallowed
helplessly
in
the
drifts
then
the
wolves
grew
fat
upon
the
victims
which
they
also
slaughtered
almost
without
effort
although
buffaloes
did
not
often
actually
perish
from
hunger
and
cold
during
the
severest
winters
save
in
a
few
very
exceptional
cases
they
often
came
out
in
very
poor
condition
the
old
bulls
always
suffered
more
severely
than
the
rest
and
at
the
end
of
winter
were
frequently
in
miserable
plight
unlike
most
other
terrestrial
quadrupeds
of
america
so
long
as
he
could
roam
at
will
the
buffalo
had
settled
migratory
habits
while
the
elk
and
deer
change
their
altitude
twice
a
year
in
conformity
with
the
approach
and
disappearance
of
winter
the
buffalo
makes
a
radical
change
of
latitude
this
was
most
noticeable
in
the
great
western
pasture
region
where
the
herds
were
most
numerous
and
their
movements
most
easily
observed
note
on
page
of
his
north
american
indians
vol
i
catlin
declares
pointedly
that
these
animals
are
truly
speaking
gregarious
but
not
migratory
they
graze
in
immense
and
almost
incredible
numbers
at
times
and
roam
about
and
over
vast
tracts
of
country
from
east
to
west
and
from
west
to
east
as
often
as
from
north
to
south
which
has
often
been
supposed
they
naturally
and
habitually
did
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
temperature
of
the
climate
in
the
different
latitudes
had
catlin
resided
continuously
in
any
one
locality
on
the
great
buffalo
range
he
would
have
found
that
the
buffalo
had
decided
migratory
habits
the
abundance
of
proof
on
this
point
renders
it
unnecessary
to
eater
fully
into
the
details
of
the
subject
at
the
approach
of
winter
the
whole
great
system
of
herds
which
ranged
from
the
peace
river
to
the
indian
territory
moved
south
a
few
hundred
miles
and
wintered
under
more
favorable
circumstances
than
each
band
would
have
experienced
at
its
farthest
north
thus
it
happened
that
nearly
the
whole
of
the
great
range
south
of
the
saskatchewan
was
occupied
by
buffaloes
even
in
winter
the
movement
north
began
with
the
return
of
mild
weather
in
the
early
spring
undoubtedly
this
northward
migration
was
to
escape
the
heat
of
their
southern
winter
range
rather
than
to
find
better
pasture
for
as
a
grazing
country
for
cattle
all
the
year
round
texas
is
hardly
surpassed
except
where
it
is
overstocked
it
was
with
the
buffaloes
a
matter
of
choice
rather
than
necessity
which
sent
them
on
their
annual
pilgrimage
northward
i
dodge
who
has
made
many
valuable
observations
on
the
migratory
habits
of
the
southern
buffaloes
has
recorded
the
following
early
in
spring
as
soon
as
the
dry
and
apparently
desert
prairie
had
begun
to
change
its
coat
of
dingy
brown
to
one
of
palest
green

the

moving

moving
constantly

some
years

in

to
move

in

immense
column
oftentimes
from
to
miles
in
width
and
of
unknown
depth
from

to

was
made
in
several
parallel
columns

at
the

rate

with
their
numerous
flankers
covering
a
width
of
a
hundred
or
more
miles
the
line
of
march
of
this
great
spring
migration
was
not
always
the
same
though
it
was
confined
within
certain
limits
i
am
informed
by
old
frontiersmen
that
it
has
not
within
years
crossed
the
arkansas

west

mulberry

the
cimarron

and
big

creek
as
the
great
herd
proceeds
northward
it
is
constantly
depleted
numbers
wandering
off
to
the
right
and
left
until
finally
it
is
scattered
in
small
herds
far
and
wide
over
the
vast
feeding
grounds
where
they
pass
the
summer
when
the
food
in
one
locality
fails
they
go
to
another
and
towards
fall
when
the
grass
of
the
high
prairie
becomes
parched
by
the
heat
and
drought
they
gradually
work
their
way
back
to
the
south
concentrating
on
the
rich
pastures
of
texas
and
the
indian
territory
whence
the
same
instinct
acting
on
all
they
are
ready
to
start
together
on
the
northward
march
as
soon
as
spring
starts
the
grass
note
our
wild
indians
so
long
as
the
bison
held
undisputed
possession
of
the
great
plains
his
migratory
habits
were
as
above
regular
general
and
on
a
scale
that
was
truly
grand
the
herds
that
wintered
in
texas
the
indian
territory
and
new
mexico
probably
spent
their
summers
in
nebraska
southwestern
dakota
and
wyoming
the
winter
herds
of
northern
colorado
wyoming
nebraska
and
southern
dakota
went
to
northern
dakota
and
montana
while
the
great
montana
herds
spent
the
summer
on
the
grand
coteau
des
prairies
lying
between
the
saskatchewan
and
the
missouri
the
two
great
annual
expeditions
of
the
red
river
which
always
took
place
in
summer
went
in
two
directions
from
winnipeg
and
pembina
one
the
white
horse
plain
division
going
westward
along
the
to
the
saskatchewan
country
and
the
other
the
red
river
division
southwest
into
dakota
in
the
site
of
the
present
city
of
jamestown
dakota
was
the
northeastern
limit
of
the
herds
that
summered
in
dakota
and
the
country
lying
between
that
point
and
the
missouri
was
for
years
the
favorite
hunting
ground
of
the
red
river
division
the
herds
which
wintered
on
the
montana
ranges
always
went
north
in
the
early
spring
usually
in
march
so
that
during
the
time
the
hunters
were
hauling
in
the
hides
taken
on
the
winter
hunt
the
ranges
were
entirely
deserted
it
is
equally
certain
however
that
a
few
small
bauds
remained
in
certain
portions
of
montana
throughout
the
summer
but
the
main
body
crossed
the
international
boundary
and
spent
the
summer
on
the
plains
of
the
saskatchewan
where
they
were
hunted
by
the
from
the
red
river
settlements
and
the
indians
of
the
plains
it
is
my
belief
that
in
this
movement
nearly
all
the
buffaloes
of
montana
and
dakota
participated
and
that
the
herds
which
spent
the
summer
in
dakota
where
they
were
annually
hunted
by
the
red
river
came
up
from
kansas
colorado
and
nebraska
while
most
of
the
calves
were
born
on
the
summer
ranges
many
were
brought
forth
en
route
it
was
the
habit
of
the
cows
to
retire
to
a
secluded
spot
if
possible
a
ravine
well
screened
from
observation
bring
forth
their
young
and
nourish
and
defend
them
until
they
were
strong
enough
to
join
the
herd
calves
were
born
all
the
time
from
march
to
july
and
sometimes
even
as
late
as
august
on
the
summer
ranges
it
was
the
habit
of
the
cows
to
leave
the
bulls
at
calving
time
and
thus
it
often
happened
that
small
herds
were
often
seen
composed
of
bulls
only
usually
the
cow
produced
but
one
calf
but
twins
were
not
uncommon
of
course
many
calves
were
brought
forth
in
the
herd
but
the
favorite
habit
of
the
cow
was
as
stated
as
soon
as
the
young
calves
were
brought
into
the
herd
which
for
prudential
reasons
occurred
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
bulls
assumed
the
duty
of
protecting
them
from
the
wolves
which
at
all
times
congregated
in
the
vicinity
of
a
herd
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
a
calf
or
a
wounded
buffalo
which
might
be
left
behind
a
calf
always
follows
its
mother
until
its
successor
is
appointed
and
installed
unless
separated
from
her
by
force
of
circumstances
they
suck
until
they
are
nine
months
old
or
even
older
and
mcnaney
once
saw
a
lusty
calf
suck
its
mother
in
january
on
the
montana
range
several
hours
after
she
had
been
killed
for
her
skin
when
a
buffalo
is
wounded
it
leaves
the
herd
immediately
and
goes
off
as
far
from
the
line
of
pursuit
as
it
can
get
to
escape
the
rabble
of
hunters
who
are
sure
to
follow
the
main
body
if
any
deep
ravines
are
at
hand
the
wounded
animal
limps
away
to
the
bottom
of
the
deepest
and
most
secluded
one
and
gradually
works
his
way
up
to
its
very
head
where
he
finds
himself
in
a
perfect
barely
wide
enough
to
admit
him
here
he
is
so
completely
hidden
by
the
high
walls
and
numerous
bends
that
his
pursuer
must
needs
come
within
a
few
feet
of
his
horns
before
his
huge
bulk
is
visible
i
have
more
than
once
been
astonished
at
the
real
impregnability
of
the
retreats
selected
by
wounded
bison
in
following
up
wounded
bulls
in
ravine
headings
it
always
became
too
dangerous
to
make
the
last
stage
of
the
pursuit
on
horseback
for
fear
of
being
caught
in
a
passage
so
narrow
as
to
insure
a
fatal
accident
to
man
or
horse
in
case
of
a
sudden
discovery
of
the
quarry
i
have
seen
wounded
bison
shelter
in
situations
where
a
single
bull
could
easily
defend
himself
from
a
whole
pack
of
wolves
being
completely
walled
in
on
both
sides
and
the
rear
and
leaving
his
foes
no
point
of
attack
save
his
head
and
horns
bison
which
were
nursing
serious
wounds
most
often
have
gone
many
days
at
a
time
without
either
food
or
water
and
in
this
connection
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
recuperative
power
of
a
bison
is
really
wonderful
judging
from
the
number
of
old
leg
wounds
fully
healed
which
i
have
found
in
freshly
killed
bisons
one
may
be
tempted
to
believe
that
a
bison
never
died
of
a
broken
leg
one
large
bull
which
i
skeletonized
had
had
his
humerus
shot
squarely
in
two
but
it
had
united
again
more
firmly
than
ever
another
large
bull
had
the
head
of
his
left
femur
and
the
hip
socket
shattered
completely
to
pieces
by
a
big
ball
but
he
had
entirely
recovered
from
it
and
was
as
lusty
a
runner
as
any
bull
we
chased
we
found
that
while
a
broken
leg
was
a
misfortune
to
a
buffalo
it
always
took
something
more
serious
than
that
to
stop
him
vi
the
food
of
the
bison
it
is
obviously
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
grasses
which
served
the
bison
as
food
on
his
native
heath
without
presenting
a
complete
list
of
all
the
plants
of
that
order
found
in
a
given
region
but
it
is
at
least
desirable
to
know
which
of
the
grasses
of
the
great
pasture
region
were
his
favorite
and
most
common
food
it
was
the
nutritious
character
and
marvelous
abundance
of
his
food
supply
which
enabled
the
bison
to
exist
in
such
absolutely
countless
numbers
as
characterized
his
occupancy
of
the
great
plains
the
following
list
comprises
the
grasses
which
were
the
bison
principal
food
named
in
the
order
of
their
importance
buffalo
grama
or
mesquite
grass
this
remarkable
grass
formed
the
de
of
the
bison
bill
of
fare
in
the
days
when
he
flourished
and
it
now
comes
to
us
daily
in
the
form
of
beef
produced
of
primest
quality
and
in
greatest
quantity
on
what
was
until
recently
the
great
buffalo
range
this
grass
is
the
most
abundant
and
widely
distributed
species
to
be
found
in
the
great
pasture
region
between
the
eastern
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
nineteenth
degree
of
west
longitude
it
is
the
principal
grass
of
the
plains
from
texas
to
the
british
possessions
and
even
in
the
latter
territory
it
is
quite
conspicuous
to
any
one
but
a
botanist
its
first
acquaintance
means
a
surprise
its
name
and
fame
lead
the
unacquainted
to
expect
a
grass
which
is
tall
rank
and
full
of
fodder
like
the
blue
joint
the
grama
grass
is
very
short
the
leaves
being
usually
not
more
than
or
inches
in
length
and
crowded
together
at
the
base
of
the
stems
the
flower
stalk
is
about
a
foot
in
height
but
on
grazed
lands
are
eaten
off
and
but
seldom
seen
the
leaves
are
narrow
and
inclined
to
curl
and
lie
close
to
the
ground
instead
of
developing
a
continuous
growth
this
grass
grows
in
small
irregular
patches
usually
about
the
size
of
a
man
hand
with
narrow
strips
of
perfectly
bare
ground
between
them
the
grass
curls
closely
upon
the
ground
in
a
woolly
carpet
or
cushion
greatly
resembling
a
layer
of
florida
moss
even
in
it
never
shows
more
color
than
a
tint
of
palest
green
and
the
landscape
which
is
dependent
upon
this
grass
for
color
is
never
more
than
a
gray
and
melancholy
waste
unlike
the
soft
juicy
and
succulent
grasses
of
the
portions
of
the
united
states
the
tiny
leaves
of
the
grama
grass
are
hard
stiff
and
dry
i
have
often
noticed
that
in
grazing
neither
cattle
nor
horses
are
able
to
bite
off
the
blades
but
instead
each
leaf
is
pulled
out
of
the
tuft
seemingly
by
its
root
notwithstanding
its
dry
and
uninviting
appearance
this
grass
is
highly
nutritious
and
its
qualities
are
unexcelled
the
heat
of
summer
dries
it
up
effectually
without
destroying
its
nutritive
elements
and
it
becomes
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
excellent
hay
cured
on
its
own
roots
it
affords
good
grazing
all
the
year
round
save
in
winter
when
it
is
covered
with
snow
and
even
then
if
the
snow
is
not
too
deep
the
buffaloes
cattle
and
horses
paw
down
through
it
to
reach
the
grass
or
else
repair
to
ridges
and
where
the
snow
has
been
blown
off
and
left
the
grass
partly
exposed
stock
prefer
it
to
all
the
other
grasses
of
the
plains
on
where
moisture
is
abundant
this
grass
develops
much
more
luxuriantly
growing
in
a
close
mass
and
often
to
a
height
of
a
foot
or
more
if
not
grazed
down
when
it
is
cut
for
hay
and
sometimes
yields
tons
to
the
acre
in
montana
and
the
north
it
is
generally
known
as
a
name
to
which
it
would
seem
to
be
fully
entitled
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
name
is
also
applied
and
quite
generally
to
another
species
the
next
to
be
noticed
southern
this
species
is
next
in
value
and
extent
of
distribution
to
the
grama
grass
it
also
is
found
all
over
the
great
plains
south
of
nebraska
and
southern
wyoming
but
not
further
north
although
in
many
localities
it
occurs
so
sparsely
as
to
be
of
little
account
a
single
bunch
of
it
very
greatly
resembles
but
its
general
growth
is
very
different
it
is
very
short
its
general
mass
seldom
rising
more
than
inches
above
the
ground
it
grows
in
extensive
patches
and
spreads
by
means
of
stolons
which
sometimes
are
feet
in
length
with
joints
every
or
inches
owing
to
its
southern
distribution
this
might
well
be
named
the
southern
buffalo
grass
to
distinguish
it
from
the
two
other
species
of
higher
latitudes
to
which
the
name
buffalo
has
been
fastened
forever
northern
wild
oat
this
grass
is
found
in
southern
manitoba
westwardly
across
the
plains
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
southward
as
far
as
montana
where
it
is
common
in
many
localities
on
what
was
once
the
buffalo
range
of
the
british
possessions
this
rank
grass
formed
the
bulk
of
the
winter
pasturage
and
in
that
region
is
quite
as
famous
as
our
grama
grass
an
allied
species
is
widely
diffused
over
our
rocky
mountain
region
extending
to
california
and
british
america
and
furnishing
a
considerable
part
of
the
wild
forage
of
the
region
bears
an
ill
name
among
stockmen
on
account
of
the
fact
that
at
the
base
of
each
seed
is
a
very
hard
and
callus
which
under
certain
circumstances
so
it
is
said
lodges
in
the
cheeks
of
domestic
animals
that
feed
upon
this
grass
when
it
is
dry
and
which
cause
much
trouble
but
the
buffalo
like
the
wild
horse
and
range
cattle
evidently
escaped
this
annoyance
this
grass
is
one
of
the
common
species
over
a
wide
area
of
the
northern
plains
and
is
always
found
on
soil
which
is
comparatively
dry
in
dakota
minnesota
and
northwest
iowa
it
forms
a
considerable
portion
of
the
upland
prairie
hay
of
the
remaining
grasses
it
is
practically
impossible
to
single
out
any
one
as
being
specially
entitled
to
fourth
place
in
this
list
there
are
several
species
which
flourish
in
different
localities
and
in
many
respects
appear
to
be
of
about
equal
importance
as
food
for
stock
of
these
the
following
are
the
most
noteworthy
western
purple
of
montana
on

solitary
bunches
about
inches
high
scattered
through
the
curly

more
favorable
conditions
it
grows
to
a
height

inches
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
grasses
of
that
region
and
in
the
fall
and
winter
its
purplish
color
makes
it
quite
noticeable
the
montana
stockmen
consider
it
one
of
the
most
valuable
grasses
of
that
region
for
stock
of
all
kinds
jacobs
assured
me
that
the
buffalo
used
to
be
very
fond
of
this
grass
and
that
wherever
this
grass
grew
in
abundance
there
were
the
best
for
the
bison
it
appears
that
is
not
sufficiently
abundant
elsewhere
in
the
northwest
to
make
it
an
important
food
for
stock
but
vesey
declares
that
it
is
abundant
on

generally
this

all
but
a
small
proportion
of
the
ruminant
food
western
when
pressed
by
hunger
the
buffalo
used
to
browse
on
certain
species
of
particularly
of
the
southwest
but
he
was
discriminating
in
the
matter
of
diet
and
as
far
as
can
be
ascertained
he
was
never
known
to
eat
the
famous
and
loco
weed
which
to
ruminant
animals
is
a
veritable
drug
of
madness
domestic
cattle
and
horses
often
eat
this
plant
where
it
is
abundant
and
become
demented
in
consequence
vii
mental
capacity
and
disposition
from
cause
to
the
buffalo
of
the
past
was
an
animal
of
a
rather
low
order
of
intelligence
and
his
dullness
of
intellect
was
one
of
the
important
factors
in
his
phenomenally
swift
extermination
he
was
provokingly
slow
in
comprehending
the
existence
and
nature
of
the
dangers
that
threatened
his
life
and
like
the
stupid
brute
that
he
was
would
very
often
stand
quietly
and
see
two
or
three
score
or
even
a
hundred
of
his
relatives
and
companions
shot
down
before
his
eyes
with
no
other
feeling
than
one
of
stupid
wonder
and
curiosity
neither
the
noise
nor
smoke
of
the
rifle
the
falling
struggling
nor
the
final
death
of
his
companions
conveyed
to
his
mind
the
idea
of
a
danger
to
be
fled
from
and
so
the
herd
stood
still
and
allowed
the
to
slaughter
its
members
at
will
like
the
indian
and
many
white
men
also
the
buffalo
seemed
to
feel
that
their
number
was
so
great
it
could
never
be
sensibly
diminished
the
presence
of
such
a
great
multitude
gave
to
each
of
its
individuals
a
feeling
of
security
and
mutual
support
that
is
very
generally
found
in
animals
who
congregate
in
great
herds
the
time
was
when
a
band
of
elk
would
stand
stupidly
and
wait
for
its
members
to
be
shot
down
one
after
another
but
it
is
believed
that
this
was
due
more
to
panic
than
to
a
lack
of
comprehension
of
danger
the
fur
seals
who
cover
the
hauling
grounds
of
paul
and
george
islands
alaska
in
countless
thousands
have
even
less
sense
of
danger
and
less
comprehension
of
the
slaughter
of
thousands
of
their
kind
which
takes
place
daily
than
had
the
bison
they
allow
themselves
to
be
herded
and
driven
off
landwards
from
the
for
half
a
mile
to
the
and
finally
with
most
cheerful
indifference
permit
the
aleuts
to
club
their
brains
out
it
is
to
be
added
that
whenever
and
wherever
seals
or
inhabit
a
given
spot
with
but
few
exceptions
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
approach
individuals
of
the
herd
the
presence
of
an
immense
number
of
individuals
plainly
begets
a
feeling
of
security
and
mutual
support
and
let
not
the
bison
or
the
seal
be
blamed
for
this
for
man
himself
exhibits
the
same
foolish
instinct
who
has
not
met
the
woman
of
mature
years
and
full
intellectual
vigor
who
is
mortally
afraid
to
spend
a
night
entirely
alone
in
her
own
house
but
is
perfectly
willing
to
do
so
and
often
does
do
so
without
fear
when
she
can
have
the
company
of
one
small
and
helpless
child
or
what
is
still
worse
three
or
four
of
them
but
with
the
approach
of
extermination
and
the
utter
breaking
up
of
all
the
herds
a
complete
change
has
been
wrought
in
the
character
of
the
bison
at
last
but
alas
entirely
too
late
the
crack
of
the
rifle
and
its
accompanying
puff
of
smoke
conveyed
to
the
slow
mind
of
the
bison
a
sense
of
deadly
danger
to
himself
at
last
he
recognized
man
whether
on
foot
or
horseback
or
peering
at
him
from
a
coulée
as
his
mortal
enemy
at
last
he
learned
to
run
in
we
found
the
scattered
remnant
of
the
great
northern
herd
the
wildest
and
most
difficult
animals
to
kill
that
we
had
ever
hunted
in
any
country
it
had
been
only
through
the
keenest
exercise
of
all
their
powers
of
that
those
buffaloes
had
survived
until
that
late
day
and
we
found
them
almost
as
swift
as
antelopes
and
far
more
wary
the
instant
a
buffalo
caught
sight
of
a
man
even
though
a
mile
distant
he
was
off
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
generally
ran
for
some
wild
region
several
miles
away
in
our
party
was
an
experienced
who
in
three
years
had
slaughtered
over
three
thousand
head
for
their
hides
he
declared
that
if
he
could
ever
catch
a
bunch
at
rest
he
could
get
a
stand
the
same
as
he
used
to
do
and
kill
several
head
before
the
rest
would
run
it
so
happened
that
the
first
time
we
found
buffaloes
we
discovered
a
bunch
of
fourteen
head
lying
in
the
sun
at
noon
on
the
level
top
of
a
low
butte
all
noses
pointing
up
the
wind
we
stole
up
within
range
and
fired
at
the
instant
the
first
shot
rang
out
up
sprang
every
buffalo
as
if
he
had
been
thrown
upon
his
feet
by
steel
springs
and
in
a
time
the
whole
bunch
was
dashing
away
from
us
with
the
speed
of
our
declared
that
in
chasing
buffaloes
we
could
count
with
certainty
upon
their
always
running
against
the
wind
for
this
had
always
been
their
habit
although
this
was
once
their
habit
we
soon
found
that
those
who
now
represent
the
survival
of
the
fittest
have
learned
better
wisdom
and
now
run
away
from
their
pursuer
and
toward
the
best
hiding
place
now
they
pay
no
attention
whatever
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
if
a
pursuer
follows
straight
behind
a
buffalo
may
change
his
course
three
or
four
times
in
a
chase
an
old
bull
once
led
one
of
our
hunters
around
of
a
circle
which
had
a
diameter
of
or
miles
the
last
buffaloes
were
mentally
as
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
as
any
animals
i
ever
hunted
the
power
of
original
reasoning
which
they
manifested
in
scattering
all
over
a
given
tract
of
rough
country
like
hostile
indians
when
hotly
pressed
by
soldiers
in
the
manner
in
which
they
hid
from
sight
in
deep
hollows
and
as
we
finally
proved
in
only
in
ravines
and
proved
conclusively
that
for
the
use
of
those
very
buffaloes
would
have
been
actually
safe
from
harm
by
man
and
that
they
would
have
increased
indefinitely
as
they
were
then
the
indians
arrows
and
spears
could
never
have
been
brought
to
bear
upon
them
save
in
rare
instances
for
they
had
thoroughly
learned
to
dread
man
and
fly
from
him
for
their
lives
could
those
buffaloes
have
been
protected
from
rifles
and
revolvers
the
resultant
race
would
have
displayed
far
more
active
mental
powers
keener
vision
and
finer
physique
than
the
extinguished
race
possessed
in
fleeing
from
an
enemy
the
buffalo
ran
against
the
wind
in
order
that
his
keen
scent
might
save
him
from
the
disaster
of
running
upon
new
enemies
which
was
an
idea
wholly
his
own
and
not
copied
by
any
other
animal
so
far
as
known
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
buffalo
of
the
past
was
very
often
a
most
stupid
reasoner
he
would
deliberately
walk
into
a
quicksand
where
hundreds
of
his
companions
were
already
ingulfed
and
in
their
he
would
quit
feeding
run
half
a
mile
and
rush
headlong
into
a
moving
train
of
cars
that
happened
to
come
between
him
and
the
main
herd
on
the
other
side
of
the
track
he
allowed
himself
to
be
impounded
and
slaughtered
by
a
howling
mob
in
a
rudely
constructed
pen
which
a
combined
effort
on
the
part
of
three
or
four
old
bulls
would
have
utterly
demolished
at
any
point
a
herd
of
a
thousand
buffaloes
would
allow
an
armed
hunter
to
gallop
into
their
midst
very
often
within
when
any
of
the
bulls
nearest
him
might
easily
have
bowled
him
over
and
had
him
trampled
to
death
in
a
moment
the
hunter
who
would
ride
in
that
manner
into
a
herd
of
the
cape
buffaloes
of
africa
would
be
unhorsed
and
killed
before
he
had
gone
half
a
furlong
the
buffalo
of
the
past
possessed
but
little
curiosity
he
was
too
dull
to
entertain
many
unnecessary
thoughts
had
he
possessed
more
of
this
peculiar
trait
which
is
the
mark
of
an
inquiring
mind
he
would
much
sooner
have
accomplished
a
comprehension
of
the
dangers
that
proved
his
destruction
his
stolid
indifference
to
everything
he
did
not
understand
cost
him
his
existence
although
in
later
years
he
displayed
more
interest
in
his
environment
on
one
occasion
in
hunting
i
staked
my
success
with
an
old
bull
i
was
pursuing
on
the
chance
that
when
he
reached
the
crest
of
a
ridge
his
curiosity
would
prompt
him
to
pause
an
instant
to
look
at
me
up
to
that
moment
he
had
had
only
one
quick
glance
at
me
before
he
started
to
run
as
he
climbed
the
slope
ahead
of
me
in
full
view
i
dismounted
and
made
ready
to
fire
the
instant
he
should
pause
to
look
at
me
as
i
expected
he
did
come
to
a
fall
stop
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
turned
half
around
to
look
at
me
but
for
his
curiosity
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
fire
at
him
under
very
serious
disadvantages
with
the
buffalo
fear
of
man
is
now
the
ruling
passion
says
colonel
dodge
he
is
as
timid
about
his
flank
and
rear
as
a
raw
recruit
when
traveling
nothing
in
front
stops
him
but
an
unusual
object
in
the
rear
will
send
him
to
the
toward
the
main
body
of
the
herd
at
the
top
of
his
speed
it
was
very
seldom
that
the
buffalo
evinced
any
courage
save
that
of
despair
which
even
cowards
possess
unconscious
of
his
strength
his
only
thought
was
flight
and
it
was
only
when
brought
to
bay
that
he
was
ready
to
fight
now
and
then
however
in
the
chase
the
buffalo
turned
upon
his
pursuer
and
overthrew
horse
and
rider
sometimes
the
tables
were
completely
turned
and
the
hunter
found
his
only
safety
in
flight
during
the
buffalo
slaughter
the
butchers
sometimes
had
narrow
escapes
from
buffaloes
supposed
to
be
dead
or
mortally
wounded
and
a
story
comes
from
the
great
northern
range
south
of
glendive
of
a
hunter
who
was
killed
by
an
old
bull
whose
tongue
he
had
actually
cut
out
in
the
belief
that
he
was
dead
sometimes
buffalo
cows
display
genuine
courage
in
remaining
with
their
calves
in
the
presence
of
danger
although
in
most
cases
they
left
their
offspring
to
their
fate
during
a
hunt
for
live
buffalo
calves
undertaken
by
jones
of
garden
city
in
and
very
graphically
described
by
a
staff
correspondent
of
the
american
field
in
a
series
of
articles
in
that
journal
under
the
title
of
the
last
of
the
buffalo
the
following
remarkable
incident
occurred
note
american
field
july
p
the
last
calf
was
caught
by
carter
who
roped
it
neatly
as
jones
cut
it
out
of
the
herd
and
turned
it
toward
him
this
was
a
fine
heifer
calf
and
was
apparently
the
idol
of
her
mother
heart
for
the
latter
came
very
near
making
a
casualty
the
price
of
the
capture
as
soon
as
the
calf
was
roped
the
old
cow
left
the
herd
and
charged
on
carter
viciously
as
he
bent
over
his
victim
seeing
the
danger
jones
rode
in
at
just
the
nick
of
time
and
drove
the
cow
off
for
a
moment
but
she
returned
again
and
again
and
finally
began
charging
him
whenever
he
came
near
so
that
much
as
he
regretted
it
he
had
to
shoot
her
with
his
revolver
which
he
did
killing
her
almost
immediately
the
mothers
of
the
thirteen
other
calves
that
were
caught
by
party
allowed
their
offspring
to
be
cut
out
lassoed
and
tied
while
they
themselves
devoted
all
their
energies
to
leaving
them
as
far
behind
as
possible
while
the
buffalo
cows
manifested
a
fair
degree
of
affection
for
their
young
the
adult
bulls
of
the
herd
often
displayed
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
safety
of
the
calves
that
was
admirable
to
say
the
least
those
who
have
had
opportunities
for
watching
large
herds
tell
us
that
whenever
wolves
approached
and
endeavored
to
reach
a
calf
the
old
bulls
would
immediately
interpose
and
drive
the
enemy
away
it
was
a
habit
for
the
bulls
to
form
the
outer
circle
of
every
small
group
or
section
of
a
great
herd
with
the
calves
in
the
center
well
guarded
from
the
wolves
which
regarded
them
as
their
most
choice
prey
colonel
dodge
records
a
remarkable
incident
in
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
bull
buffaloes
protected
the
calves
of
the
herd
note
plains
of
the
great
west
p
the
duty
of
protecting
the
calves
devolved
almost
entirely
on
the
bulls
i
have
seen
evidences
of
this
many
times
but
the
most
remarkable
instance
i
have
ever
heard
of
was
related
to
me
by
an
army
surgeon
who
was
an
he
was
one
evening
returning
to
camp
after
a
day
hunt
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
curious
action
of
a
little
knot
of
six
or
eight
buffalo
approaching
sufficiently
near
to
see
clearly
he
discovered
that
this
little
knot
were
all
bulls
standing
in
a
close
circle
with
their
heads
outwards
while
in
a
concentric
circle
at
some
or
paces
distant
sat
licking
their
chaps
in
impatient
expectancy
at
least
a
dozen
large
gray
wolves
excepting
man
the
most
dangerous
enemy
of
the
buffalo
the
doctor
determined
to
watch
the
performance
after
a
few
moments
the
knot
broke
up
and
still
keeping
in
a
compact
mass
started
on
a
trot
for
the
main
herd
some
half
a
mile
oft
to
his
very
great
astonishment
the
doctor
now
saw
that
the
central
and
controlling
figure
of
this
mass
was
a
poor
little
calf
so
newly
born
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
walk
after
going
or
paces
the
calf
laid
down
the
bulls
disposed
themselves
in
a
circle
as
before
and
the
wolves
who
had
trotted
along
on
each
side
of
their
retreating
supper
sat
down
and
licked
their
chaps
again
and
though
the
doctor
did
not
see
the
finale
it
being
late
and
the
camp
distant
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
noble
fathers
did
their
whole
duty
by
their
offspring
and
carried
it
safely
to
the
herd
i
have
asked
many
old
buffalo
hunters
for
facts
in
regard
to
the
temper
and
disposition
of
herd
buffaloes
and
all
agree
that
they
are
exceedingly
quiet
peace
loving
and
even
indolent
animals
at
all
times
save
during
the
rutting
season
says
colonel
dodge
the
habits
of
the
buffalo
are
almost
identical
with
those
of
the
domestic
cattle
owing
either
to
a
more
pacific
disposition
or
to
the
greater
number
of
bulls
there
is
very
little
fighting
even
at
the
season
when
it
might
be
expected
i
have
been
among
them
for
days
have
watched
their
conduct
for
hours
at
a
time
and
with
the
very
best
opportunities
for
observation
but
have
never
seen
a
regular
combat
between
bulls
they
frequently
strike
each
other
with
their
horns
but
this
seems
to
be
a
mere
expression
of
impatience
at
being
crowded
in
referring
to
the
running
season
of
the
buffalo
catlin
says
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
at
this
season
at
these
gatherings
to
see
several
thousands
in
a
mass
eddying
and
wheeling
about
under
a
cloud
of
dust
which
is
raised
by
the
bulls
as
they
are
pawing
in
the
dirt
or
engaged
in
desperate
combats
as
they
constantly
are
plunging
and
butting
at
each
other
in
a
most
furious
manner
on
the
whole
the
disposition
of
the
buffalo
is
anything
but
vicious
both
sexes
yield
with
surprising
readiness
to
the
restraints
of
captivity
and
in
a
remarkably
short
time
become
if
taken
young
as
fully
domesticated
as
ordinary
cattle
buffalo
calves
are
as
easily
tamed
as
domestic
ones
and
make
very
interesting
pets
a
prominent
trait
of
character
in
the
captive
buffalo
is
a
mulish
obstinacy
or
headstrong
perseverance
under
certain
circumstances
that
is
often
very
annoying
when
a
buffalo
makes
up
his
mind
to
go
through
a
fence
he
is
very
apt
to
go
through
either
peaceably
or

however

viii
value
of
the
buffalo
to
man
it
may
fairly
be
supposed
that
if
the
people
of
this
country
could
have
been
made
to
realize
the
immense
money
value
of
the
great
buffalo
herds
as
they
existed
in
a
vigorous
and
successful
effort
would
have
been
made
to
regulate
and
restrict
the
slaughter
the
fur
seal
of
alaska
of
which
about
are
killed
annually
for
their
skins
yield
an
annual
revenue
to
the
government
of
and
add
more
to
the
actual
wealth
of
the
united
states
it
pays
to
protect
those
seals
and
we
mean
to
protect
them
against
all
comers
who
seek
their
unrestricted
slaughter
no
matter
whether
the
poachers
be
american
english
russian
or
canadian
it
would
be
folly
to
do
otherwise
and
if
those
who
would
exterminate
the
fur
seal
by
shooting
them
in
the
water
will
not
desist
for
the
telling
then
they
must
by
the
compelling
the
fur
seal
is
a
good
investment
for
the
united
states
and
their
number
is
not
diminishing
as
the
buffalo
herds
existed
in
head
of
bulls
young
and
old
could
have
been
killed
every
year
for
a
score
of
years
without
sensibly
diminishing
the
size
of
the
herds
at
a
low
estimate
these
could
easily
have
been
made
to
yield
various
products
worth
each
as
follows
kobe
tongue
cents
meat
of
hindquarters
bones
horns
and
hoofs
cents
total
and
the
amount
annually
added
to
the
wealth
of
the
united
states
would
have
been
on
all
the
robes
taken
for
the
market
say
the
government
could
have
collected
a
tax
of
cents
each
which
would
have
yielded
a
sum
doubly
sufficient
to
have
maintained
a
force
of
mounted
police
fully
competent
to
enforce
the
laws
regulating
the
slaughter
had
a
contract
for
the
protection
of
the
buffalo
been
offered
at
per
annum
ay
or
even
half
that
sum
an
army
of
competent
men
would
have
competed
for
it
every
year
and
it
could
have
been
carried
out
to
the
letter
but
as
yet
the
american
people
have
not
learned
to
spend
money
for
the
protection
of
valuable
game
and
by
the
time
they
do
learn
it
there
will
be
no
game
to
protect
even
despite
the
enormous
waste
of
raw
material
that
ensued
in
the
utilization
of
the
buffalo
product
the
total
cash
value
of
all
the
material
derived
from
this
source
if
it
could
only
be
reckoned
up
would
certainly
amount
to
many
millions
of
dollars
perhaps
twenty
millions
all
told
this
estimate
may
to
some
seem
high
but
when
we
stop
to
consider
that
in
eight
years
from
to
a
single
firm
that
of
j
boskowitz
greene
street
new
york
paid
out
the
enormous
sum
of
nearly
one
million
for
robes
and
hides
and
that
in
a
single
year
another
firm
that
of
joseph
ullman
mercer
street
new
york
paid
out
for
robes
and
hides
it
may
not
seem
so
incredible
had
there
been
a
deliberate
plan
for
the
suppression
of
all
statistics
relating
to
the
slaughter
of
buffalo
in
the
united
states
and
what
it
yielded
the
result
could
not
have
been
more
complete
barrenness
than
exists
in
regard
to
this
subject
there
is
only
one
railway
company
which
kept
its
books
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
the
kind
and
quantity
of
its
business
at
that
time
excepting
this
nothing
is
known
definitely
fortunately
enough
facts
and
figures
were
recorded
during
the
hunting
operations
of
the
red
river
to
enable
us
by
bringing
them
all
together
to
calculate
with
sufficient
exactitude
the
value
of
the
buffalo
to
them
from
to
the
result
ought
to
be
of
interest
to
all
who
think
it
is
not
worth
while
to
spend
money
in
preserving
our
characteristic
game

in

detailed
accounts

of

expeditions

the
with
many
valuable
statistics
on
this
data
we
base
our
calculation
taking
the
result
of
one
particular
day
slaughter
as
an
index
to
the
methods
of
the
hunters
in
utilizing
the
products
of
the
chase
we
find
that
while
not
less
than
animals
were
killed
out
of
that
number
only
bags
of
pemmican
and
bales
of
dried
meat
were
made
now
says
ross
making
all
due
allowance
for
waste
animals
would
have
been
ample
for
such
a
result
what
then
we
might
ask
became
of
the
remaining
scarcely

number
of
the

killed
is
turned
to
account
a

weighs

pounds

a

economically

yields
half
a

of
pemmican
about
pounds
and
of
a
bundle
of

the
most
economical
calculate
that
from
eight

ten

are
required

by
ross

returned
with

making
pounds
for
each

and
pounds
for
each
individual
in
the
expedition
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
allowing
as
already
ascertained
that
of
the
above
quantity
of
product
every
pounds
represents
one
cow
saved

two

one
third

wasted
it
means
that
buffaloes

at

nearly
all

the

was
this
gift
of

gods
utilized
by
the
children
of

to
whom
it
came
up
to
the

to
support
our
western
indians
by
the
payment
of
annuities
and
furnishing
quarterly

the
buffalo
had
been
the
main
dependence
of
more
than
indians
who
inhabited
the
buffalo
range
and
its
environs
of
the
many
different
uses
to
which
the
buffalo
and
his
various
parts
were
put
by
the
red
man
the
following
were
the
principal
ones
the
body
of
the
buffalo
yielded
fresh
meat
of
which
thousands
of
tons
were
consumed
dried
meat
prepared
in
summer
for
winter

marrow
preserved

dried
and
smoked
and
eaten
as
a
delicacy
the
skin
of
the
buffalo
yielded
a
robe
dressed
with
the
hair
on
for
clothing
and
bedding
a
hide
dressed
without
the
hair
which
made
a

after

the

tent
took
the
place
of
the
buffalo
robe
and
the
teepee
and
government
beef
took
the
place
of
buffalo
meat
but
the
slaughter
of
buffaloes
went
on
just
the
same
and
the
robes
and
hides
taken
were
traded
for
useless
and
often
harmful
luxuries
such
as
canned
provisions
fancy
knickknacks
whisky
of
the
most
approved
pattern
and
quantities
of
fixed
ammunition
during
the
last
ten
years
of
the
existence
of
the
herds
it
is
an
open
question
whether
the
buffalo
did
not
do
our
indians
more
harm
than
good
amongst
the
crows
who
were
liberally
provided
for
by
the
government
horse
racing
was
a
common
pastime
and
the
stakes
were
usually
dressed
buffalo
robes
note
on
one
occasion
which
is
doubtless
still
remembered
with
bitterness
by
many
a
crow
of
the
custer
agency
my
old
friend
jim
mcnaney
backed
his
horse
ogalalla
against
the
horses
of
the
whole
crow
tribe
the
crows
forthwith
formed
a
pool
which
consisted
of
a
huge
pile
of
buffalo
robes
worth
about
and
with
it
backed
their
best
he
was
forthwith
beaten
out
of
sight
by
ogalalla
and
another
grievance
was
registered
against
the
whites
the
total
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
has
made
no
perceptible
difference
in
the
annual
cost
of
the
indians
to
the
government
during
the
years
when
buffaloes
were
numerous
and
robes
for
the
purchase
of
and
cartridges
were
plentiful
indian
wars
were
frequent
and
always
costly
to
the
government
the
indians
were
then
quite
independent
because
they
could
take
the
war
path
at
any
time
and
live
on
buffalo
indefinitely
now
the
case
is
very
different
the
last
time
sitting
bull
went
on
the
and
was
driven
up
into
manitoba
he
had
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
living
on
his
ponies
and
dogs
until
he
became
utterly
starved
out
since
his
last
escapade
the
sioux
have
been
compelled
to
admit
that
the
game
is
up
and
the
is
open
to
them
no
longer
should
they
wish
to
do
otherwise
they
know
that
they
could
survive
only
by
killing
cattle
and
cattle
that
are
guarded
by
cowboys
and
ranchmen
are
no
man
game
therefore
while
we
no
longer
have
to
pay
for
an
annual
campaign
in
force
against
hostile
indians
the
total
absence
of
the
buffalo
brings
upon
the
nation
the
entire
support
of
the
indian
and
the
cash
outlay
each
year
is
as
great
as
ever
the
value
of
the
american
bison
to
civilized
man
can
never
be
calculated
nor
even
fairly
estimated
it
may
with
safety
be
said
however
that
it
has
been
probably
tenfold
greater
than
most
persons
have
ever
supposed
it
would
be
a
work
of
years
to
gather
statistics
of
the
immense
bulk
of
robes
and
hides
undoubtedly
amounting
to
millions
in
the
aggregate
the
thousands
of
tons
of
meat
and
the
of
bones
which
have
been
actually
utilized
by
man
nor
can
the
effect
of
the
bison
presence
upon
the
general
development
of
the
great
west
ever
be
calculated
it
has
sunk
into
the
great
sum
total
of
our
progress
and
well
nigh
lost
to
sight
forever
as
a
mere
suggestion
of
the
immense
value
of
the
buffalo
product
at
the
time
when
it
had
an
existence
i
have
obtained
from
two
of
our
leading
fur
houses
in
new
york
city
with
branches
elsewhere
a
detailed
statement
of
their
business
in
buffalo
robes
and
hides
during
the
last
few
years
of
the
trade
they
not
only
serve
to
show
the
great
value
of
the
share
of
the
annual
crop
that
passed
through
their
hands
but
that
of
j
boskowitz
is
of
especial
value
because
being
carefully
itemized
throughout
it
shows
the
decline
and
final
failure
of
the
trade
in
exact
figures
i
am
under
many
obligations
to
both
these
firms
for
their
kindness
in
furnishing
the
facts
i
desired

especially
to
the

devoted
considerable

the

joseph

exporter

importer
of

the
following
letter
was
written
me
by
joseph
ullman
on
november
for
which
i
am
greatly
indebted
inasmuch
as
you
particularly
desire
the
figures
for
the
years
i
have
gone
through
my
buffalo
robe
and
hide
accounts
of
those
years
and
herewith
give
you
approximate
figures
as
there
are
a
good
many
things
to
be
considered
which
make
it
difficult
to
give
exact
figures
in
we
handled
about

about

average

about
in
we
purchased
between
and

at
an
average
cost
of
about

about

at
an
average
cost
of
about
in
we
purchased
from
to
hides
and
about
to
robes
at
a
slight
advance
in
price
against
the
year
previous
in
we
purchased
less
than
hides
and
in
my
opinion
these
were
such
as
were
carried
over
from
the
previous
season
in
the
northwest
and
were
not
skins
the
collection
of
robes
this
season
was
also
comparatively
small
and
nominally
robes
carried
over
from
in
the
collection
of
hides
amounted
to
little
or
nothing
the
aforesaid
goods
were
all
purchased
direct
in
the
northwest
that
is
to
say
principally
in
montana
and
shipped
in
care
of
our
branch
house
at
paul
minnesota
to
joseph
ullman
chicago
the
robes
mentioned
above
were
robes
and
were
mainly
disposed
of
to
the
jobbing
trade
both
east
and
west
in
and
the
years
prior
the
hides
were
divided
into
two
kinds
viz
robe
hides
which
were
such
as
had
a
good
crop
of
fur
and
were
serviceable
for
robe
purposes
and
the
heavy
and
bull
hides
the
former
were
principally
sold
to
the
john
way
manufacturing
company
bridgeport
connecticut
and
to
numerous
small
robe
tanners
while
the
latter
were
sold
for
leather
purposes
to
various
throughout
the
united
states
and
canada
and
brought
to
cents
per
pound
a
very
large
proportion
of
these
latter
were
tanned
by
the
wilcox
tanning
company
wilcox
pennsylvania
about
the
fall
of
we
established
a
tannery
for
buffalo
robes
in
chicago
and
from
that
time
forth
we
tanned
all
the
good
hides
which
we
received
into
robes
and
disposed
of
them
in
the
same
manner
as
the
robes
i
do
know
that
i
am
called
upon
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
the
benefit
or
disadvantage
of
the
extermination
of
the
buffalo
but
nevertheless
take
the
liberty
to
say
that
i
think
that
some
proper
law
restricting
the
unpardonable
slaughter
of
the
buffalo
should
have
been
enacted
at
the
time
it
is
a
fact
that
soon
after
the
northern
pacific
railroad
opened
up
that
portion
of
the
country
thereby
making
the
transportation
of
the
buffalo
hides
feasible
that
is
to
say
reducing
the
cost
of
freight
thousands
upon
thousands
of
buffaloes
were
killed
for
the
sake
of
the
hide
alone
while
the
carcasses
were
left
to
rot
on
the
open
plains
the
average
prices
paid
the
buffalo
hunters
from
to
was
about
as
follows
for
cow
hides
robes
bull
hides
yearlings
calves
cents
and
the
cost
of
getting
the
hides
to
market
brought
the
cost
up
to
about
per
hide
the
amount
actually
paid
out
by
joseph
ullman
in
four
years
for
buffalo
robes
and
hides
was
about
and
this
too
long
after
the
great
southern
herd
had
ceased
to
exist
and
when
the
northern
herd
furnished
the
sole
supply
it
thus
appears
that
during
the
course
of
eight
years
business
leaving
out
the
small
sum
paid
out
in
on
the
part
of
the
boskowitz
and
four
years
on
that
of
joseph
ullman
these
two
firms
alone
paid
out
the
enormous
sum
of
for
buffalo
robes
and
hides
which
they
purchased
to
sell
again
at
a
good
profit
by
the
time
their
share
of
the
buffalo
product
reached
the
consumers
it
must
have
represented
an
actual
money
value
of
about
besides
these
two
firms
there
were
at
that
time
many
others
who
also
handled
great
quantities
of
buffalo
skins
and
hides
for
which
they
paid
out
immense
sums
of
money
in
this
country
the
other
leading
firms
engaged
in
this
business
were
baker
of
fort
benton
weare
chicago
obern
hoosick
chicago
and
saint
paul
martin
bates
and
shearer
nichols
now
hurlburt
shearer
sanford
of
new
york
there
were
also
many
others
whose
names
i
am
now
unable
to
recall
in
the
british
possessions
and
canada
the
frontier
business
was
largely
monopolized
by
the
hudson
bay
fur
company
although
the
annual
output
of
robes
and
hides
was
but
small
in
comparison
with
that
gathered
in
the
united
states
where
the
herds
were
far
more
numerous
even
in
their
most
fruitful
locality
for
robes
the
country
south
of
the
saskatchewan
this
company
had
a
very
powerful
competitor
in
the
firm
of
baker
of
fort
benton
which
secured
the
lion
share
of
the
spoil
and
sent
it
down
the
missouri
river
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
utilization
of
the
buffalo
product
even
so
far
as
it
was
accomplished
resulted
in
the
addition
of
several
millions
of
dollars
to
the
wealth
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
the
total
sum
could
it
be
reckoned
up
would
amount
to
at
least
fifteen
millions
seems
reasonably
certain
and
my
own
impression
is
that
twenty
millions
would
be
nearer
the
mark
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
exact
truth
can
never
be
known
for
in
this
age
of
universal
slaughter
a
knowledge
of
the
cash
value
of
the
wild
game
of
the
united
states
that
has
been
killed
up
to
date
might
go
far
toward
bringing
about
the
actual
as
well
as
the
theoretical
protection
of
what
remains
utilization
of
the
buffalo
by
white
men
ordinarily
the
skin
of
a
large
ruminant
is
of
little
value
in
comparison
with
the
bulk
of
toothsome
flesh
it
covers
in
fattening
domestic
cattle
for
the
market
the
value
of
the
hide
is
so
insignificant
that
it
amounts
to
no
more
than
a
butcher
perquisite
in
reckoning
up
the
value
of
the
animal
with
the
buffalo
however
so
enormous
was
the
waste
of
the
really
available
product
that
probably
of
the
total
value
derived
from
the
slaughter
of
the
animal
came
from
his
skin
alone
of
this
about
came
from
the
utilization
of
the
furry
robe
and
from
skins
classed
as
hides
which
were
either
taken
in
the
summer
season
when
the
hair
was
very
short
or
almost
absent
and
used
for
the
manufacture
of
leather
and
leather
goods
or
else
were
the
skins
of
old
bulls
the
season
for
was
from
october
to
february
and
a
little
later
in
the
more
northern
latitudes
in
the
united
states
the
hair
of
the
buffalo
was
still
rather
short
up
to
the
first
of
november
but
by
the
middle
of
november
it
was
about
at
its
finest
as
to
length
density
color
and
freshness
the
montana
hunters
considered
that
the
finest
robes
were
those
taken
from
november
to
december
before
the
former
date
the
hair
had
not
quite
attained
perfection
in
length
and
after
the
latter
it
began
to
show
wear
and
lose
color
the
winter
storms
of
december
and
january
began
to
leave
their
mark
upon
the
robes
by
the
of
february
chiefly
by
giving
the
hair
a
bleached
and
weathered
appearance
by
the
middle
of
february
the
pelage
was
decidedly
on
the
wane
and
the
was
also
losing
his
energy
often
however
the
hunt
was
kept
up
until
the
middle
of
march
until
either
the
deterioration
of
the
quality
of
the
robe
the
migration
of
the
herds
northward
or
the
hunter
longing
to
return
to
town
and
clean
up
brought
the
hunt
to
an
end
on
the
northern
buffalo
range
the
hunter
or
buffalo
skinner
removed
the
robe
in
the
following
manner
when
the
operator
had
to
do
his
work
alone
which
was
almost
always
the
case
he
made
haste
to
skin
his
victims
while
they
were
yet
warm
if
possible
and
before
had
set
in
but
at
all
hazards
before
they
should
become
hard
frozen
with
a
warm
buffalo
he
could
easily
do
his
work
but
with
one
rigid
or
frozen
stiff
it
was
a
very
different
matter
his
first
act
was
to
heave
the
carcass
over
until
it
lay
fairly
upon
its
back
with
its
feet
up
in
the
air
to
keep
it
in
that
position
he
wrenched
the
head
violently
around
to
one
side
close
against
the
shoulder
at
the
point
where
the
hump
was
highest
and
the
tendency
to
roll
the
greatest
and
used
it
very
effectually
as
a
chock
to
keep
the
body
from
rolling
back
upon
its
side
having
fixed
the
carcass
in
position
he
drew
forth
his
steel
sharpened
his
and
at
once
proceeded
to
make
all
the
opening
cuts
in
the
skin
each
leg
was
girdled
to
the
bone
about
inches
above
the
hoof
and
the
skin
of
the
leg
ripped
open
from
that
point
along
the
inside
to
the
median
line
of
the
body
a
long
straight
cut
was
then
made
along
the
middle
of
the
breast
and
abdomen
from
the
root
of
the
tail
to
the
chin
in
skinning
cows
and
young
animals
nothing
but
the
skin
of
the
forehead
and
nose
was
left
on
the
skull
the
skin
of
the
throat
and
cheeks
being
left
on
the
hide
but
in
skinning
old
bulls
on
whose
heads
the
skin
was
very
thick
and
tough
the
whole
head
was
left
unskinned
to
save
labor
and
time
the
skin
of
the
neck
was
severed
in
a
circle
around
the
neck
just
behind
the
ears
it
is
these
huge
heads
of
bushy
brown
hair
looking
at
a
little
distance
quite
black
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
ghastly
whiteness
of
the
perfect
skeletons
behind
them
which
gives
such
a
weird
and
ghostly
appearance
to
the
lifeless
prairies
of
montana
where
the
has
not
yet
done
his
perfect
work
the
skulls
of
the
cows
and
young
buffaloes
are
as
clean
and
bare
as
if
they
had
been
carefully
macerated
and
bleached

a
skilled
osteologist

the
opening
cuts
having
been
made
the
was
duly
sharpened
and
with
it
the
operator
fell
to
work
to
detach
the
skin
from
the
body
in
the
shortest
possible
time
the
tail
was
always
skinned
and
left
on
the
hide
as
soon
as
the
skin
was
taken
off
it
was
spread
out
on
a
clean
smooth
and
level
spot
of
ground
and
stretched
to
its
fullest
extent
inside
uppermost
on
the
northern
range
very
few
skins
were
pegged
out
stretched
thoroughly
and
held
by
means
of
wooden
pegs
driven
through
the
edges
of
the
skin
into
the
earth
it
was
practiced
to
a
limited
extent
on
the
southern
range
during
the
latter
part
of
the
great
slaughter
when
buffaloes
were
scarce
and
time
abundant
ordinarily
however
there
was
no
time
for
pegging
nor
were
pegs
available
on
the
range
to
do
the
work
with
a
warm
skin
stretched
on
the
curly
hair
side
down
sticks
to
the
ground
of
itself
until
it
has
ample
time
to
harden
on
the
northern
range
the
skinner
always
cut
the
initials
of
his
outfit
in
the
thin
subcutaneous
muscle
which
was
always
found
adhering
to
the
skin
on
each
side
and
which
made
a
permanent
and
very
plain
mark
of
ownership
in
the
south
the
traders
who
bought
buffalo
robes
on
the
range
sometimes
rigged
up
a
rude
press
with
four
upright
posts
and
a
huge
lever
in
which
robes
that
had
been
folded
into
a
convenient
size
were
pressed
into
bales
like
bales
of
cotton
these
could
be
transported
by
wagon
much
more
economically
than
could
loose
robes
an
illustration
of
this
process
is
given
in
an
article
by
theodore
davis
entitled
the
buffalo
range
in
for
january
vol
xxxviii
the
author
describes
the
process
as
follows
as
the
robes
are
secured
the
trader
has
them
arranged
in
lots
of
ten
each
with
but
little
regard
for
quality
other
than
some
care
that
particularly
fine
robes
do
not
go
too
many
in
one
lot
these
piles
are
then
pressed
into
a
compact
bale
by
means
of
a
rudely
constructed
affair
composed
of
saplings
and
a
chain
on
the
northern
range
skins
were
not
folded
until
the
time
came
to
haul
them
in
then
the
hunter
repaired
to
the
scene
of
his
winter
work
with
a
wagon
surmounted
by
a
or
something
like
it
usually
drawn
by
four
horses
as
the
skins
were
gathered
up
they
were
folded
once
lengthwise
down
the
middle
with
the
hair
inside
sometimes
as
many
as
skins
were
hauled
at
one
load
by
four
horses
on
one
portion
of
the
northern
range
the
classification
of
buffalo
peltries
was
substantially
as
follows
under
the
head
was
included
all
cow
skins
taken
during
the
proper
season
from
one
year
old
upward
and
all
bull
skins
from
one
to
three
years
old
bull
skins
over
three
years
of
age
were
classed
as
and
while
the
best
of
them
were
finally
tanned
and
used
as
robes
the
really
poor
ones
were
converted
into
leather
the
large
robes
when
tanned
were
used
very
generally
throughout
the
colder
portions
of
north
america
as
sleigh
robes
and
wraps
and
for
bedding
in
the
regions
of
extreme
cold
the
small
robes
from
the
young
animals
and
likewise
many
large
robes
were
made
into
overcoats
at
once
the
warmest
and
the
most
cumbersome
that
ever
enveloped
a
human
being
thousands
of
old
bull
robes
were
tanned
with
the
hair
on
and
the
body
portions
were
made
into
overshoes
with
the
woolly
hair
inside
absurdly
large
and
uncouth
but
very
warm
i
never
wore
a
pair
of
buffalo
overshoes
without
being
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
mortification
at
the
ridiculous
size
of
my
combined
big
boots
inside
of
huge
overshoes
and
supreme
comfort
derived
from
feet
that
were
always
warm
besides
the
ordinary
robe
the
hunters
and
fur
buyers
of
montana
recognized
four
special
qualities
as
follows
the
beaver
robe
with
exceedingly
fine
wavy
fur
the
color
of
a
beaver
and
having
long
coarse
straight
hairs
coming
through
it
the
latter
were
of
course
plucked
out
in
the
process
of
manufacture
these
were
very
rare
in
james
mcnaney
took
one
a
cow
robe
the
only
one
out
of
robes
taken
that
season
and
sold
it
for
when
ordinary
robes
fetched
only
the
robe
is
described
as
having
the
nose
flanks
and
inside
of
fore
legs
whatever
that
may
mean
while
the
remainder
of
the
robe
is
jet
black
a
buckskin
robe
is
from
what
is
always
called
a
white
buffalo
and
is
in
reality
a
dirty
cream
color
instead
of
white
a
robe
of
this
character
sold
in
miles
city
in
for
and
was
the
only
one
of
that
character
taken
on
the
northern
range
during
that
entire
winter
a
very
few
pure
white
robes
have
been
taken
so
i
have
been
told
chiefly
by
indians
but
i
have
never
seen
one
a
blue
robe
or
robe
is
one
on
which
the
body
color
shows
a
decidedly
bluish
cast
and
at
the
same
time
has
long
fine
fur
out
of
his
robes
taken
in
mcnaney
picked
out
which
passed
muster
as
the
much
sought
for
blue
robes
and
they
sold
at
each
as
already
intimated
the
price
paid
on
the
range
for
ordinary
buffalo
skins
varied
according
to
circumstances
and
at
different
periods
and
in
different
localities
ranged
all
the
way
from
cents
to
the
latter
figure
was
paid
in
texas
in
for
the
last
lot
of
robes
ever
taken
the
lowest
prices
ever
paid
were
during
the
tremendous
slaughter
which
annihilated
the
southern
herd
even
as
late
as
in
the
southern
country
cow
robes
brought
on
the
range
only
from
to
cents
and
bull
robes
on
the
northern
range
from
to
the
prices
paid
were
much
higher
ranging
from

a
few
hundred
dressed
robes
still
remain
in
the
hands
of
some
of
the
largest
fur
dealers
in
new
york
chicago
and
montreal
which
can
be
purchased
at
prices
much
lower
than
one
would
expect
considering
the
circumstances
in
good
robes
indian
tanned
were
offered
in
new
york
at
prices
ranging
from
to
according
to
size
and
quality
but
in
montreal
no
robes
were
obtainable
at
less
than
next
in
importance
to
robes
was
the
class
of
skins
known
commercially
as
hides
under
this
head
were
classed
all
skins
which
for
any
reason
did
not
possess
the
pelage
necessary
to
a
robe
and
were
therefore
fit
only
for
conversion
into
leather
of
these
the
greater
portion
consisted
of
the
skins
of
old
bulls
on
which
the
hair
was
of
poor
quality
and
the
skin
itself
too
thick
and
heavy
to
ever
allow
of
its
being
made
into
a
soft
pliable
and
robe
the
remaining
portion
of
the
hides
marketed
were
from
buffaloes
killed
in
spring
and
summer
when
the
body
and
hindquarters
ware
almost
naked
apparently
the
quantity
of
hides
marketed
was
not
very
great
for
it
was
only
the
meanest
and
most
unprincipled
ones
of
the
grand
army
of
who
were
mean
enough
to
kill
buffaloes
in
summer
simply
for
their
hides
it
is
said
that
at
one
time
was
practiced
on
the
southern
range
to
an
extent
that
became
a
cause
for
alarm
to
the
great
body
of
more
respectable
hunters
and
the
practice
was
frowned
upon
so
severely
that
the
wretches
who
engaged
in
it
found
it
wise
to
abandon
it
next
in
importance
to
robes
and
hides
was
the
bone
product
the
utilization
of
which
was
rendered
possible
by
the
rigorous
climate
of
the
buffalo
plains
under
the
influence
of
the
wind
and
sun
and
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
the
flesh
remaining
upon
a
carcass
dried
up
disintegrated
and
fell
to
dust
leaving
the
bones
of
almost
the
entire
skeleton
as
clean
and
bare
as
if
they
had
been
stripped
of
flesh
by
some
powerful
chemical
process
very
naturally
no
sooner
did
the
live
buffaloes
begin
to
grow
scarce
than
the
miles
of
bleaching
bones
suggested
the
idea
of
finding
a
use
for
them
a
market
was
readily
found
for
them
in
the
east
and
the
prices
paid
per
ton
were
sufficient
to
make
the
business
of
quite
remunerative
the
bulk
of
the
bone
product
was
converted
into
phosphate
for
fertilizing
purposes
but
much
of
it
was
turned
into
carbon
for
use
in
the
refining
of
sugar
the
gathering
of
bones
became
a
common
industry
as
early
as
during
which
year
pounds
were
shipped
over
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
railroad
in
the
year
following
the
same
road
shipped
pounds
and
in
it
handled
pounds
more
this
trade
continued
from
that
time
on
until
the
plains
have
been
gleaned
so
far
back
from
the
railway
lines
that
it
is
no
longer
profitable
to
seek
them
for
that
matter
however
it
is
said
that
south
of
the
union
pacific
nothing
worth
the
seeking
now
remains
the
building
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
made
possible
the
shipment
of
immense
quantities
of
dry
bones
even
as
late
as
overland
travelers
saw
at
many
of
the
stations
between
jamestown
dakota
and
billings
montana
immense
heaps
of
bones
lying
alongside
the
track
awaiting
shipment
in
a
single
firm
shipped
over
tons
of
bones
from
miles
city
the
valley
of
the
missouri
river
was
gleaned
by
teamsters
who
gathered
bones
from
as
far
back
as
miles
and
hauled
them
to
the
river
for
shipment
on
the
steamers
an
operator
who
had
eight
wagons
in
the
business
informed
me
that
in
order
to
ship
bones
on
the
river
steamers
it
was
necessary
to
crush
them
and
that
for
crushed
bones
shipped
in
bags
a
michigan
fertilizer
company
paid
per
ton
uncrushed
bones
shipped
by
the
railway
sold
for
per
ton
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
the
total
amount
or
value
of
the
bone
product
but
it
is
certain
that
it
amounted
to
many
thousand
tons
and
in
value
must
have
amounted
to
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
but
for
the
great
number
of
railroads
river
steamers
and
vessels
from
texas
ports
engaged
in
carrying
this
product
it
would
have
cut
an
important
figure
in
the
commerce
of
the
country
but
owing
to
the
many
interests
between
which
it
was
divided
it
attracted
little
attention
the
amount
of
fresh
buffalo
meat
cured
and
marketed
was
really
very
insignificant
so
long
as
it
was
to
be
had
at
all
it
was
so
very
abundant
that
it
was
worth
only
from
to
cents
per
pound
in
the
market
and
many
reasons
combined
to
render
the
trade
in
fresh
buffalo
meat
anything
but
profitable
probably
not
more
than
one
of
the
buffalo
meat
that
might
have
been
saved
and
utilized
was
saved
the
buffalo
carcasses
that
were
wasted
on
the
great
plains
every
year
during
the
two
great
periods
of
slaughter
of
the
northern
and
southern
herds
would
probably
have
fed
to
satiety
during
the
entire
time
more
than
a
million
persons
as
to
the
quality
of
buffalo
meat
it
may
be
stated
in
general
terms
that
it
differs
in
no
way
whatever
from
domestic
beef
of
the
same
age
produced
by
the
same
kind
of
grass
perhaps
there
is
no
finer
grazing
ground
in
the
world
than
montana
and
the
beef
it
produces
is
certainly
entitled
to
rank
with
the
best
there
are
many
persons
who
claim
to
recognize
a
difference
between
the
taste
of
buffalo
meat
and
domestic
beef
but
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
any
difference
really
exists
unless
it
is
that
the
flesh
of
the
buffalo
is
a
little
sweeter
and
more
juicy
as
for
myself
i
feel
certain
i
could
not
tell
the
difference
between
the
flesh
of
a
old
buffalo
and
that
of
a
domestic
beef
of
the
same
age
nor
do
i
believe
any
one
else
could
even
on
a
wager
having
once
seen
a
butcher
eat
an
elephant
steak
in
the
belief
that
it
was
beef
from
his
own
shop
and
another
butcher
eat
steak
for
beef
i
have
become
somewhat
skeptical
in
regard
to
the
intelligence
of
the
human
palate
as
a
matter
of
experiment
during
our
hunt
for
buffalo
we
had
buffalo
meat
of
all
ages
from
one
year
up
to
eleven
cooked
in
as
many
different
ways
as
our
culinary
department
could
turn
out
we
had
it
broiled
fried
with
batter
roasted
boiled
and
stewed
the
last
method
when
employed
upon
slices
of
meat
that
had
been
hacked
from
a
frozen
produced
results
that
were
undeniably
tough
and
not
particularly
good
but
it
was
an
unfair
way
to
cook
any
kind
of
meat
and
may
be
guarantied
to
spoil
the
finest
beef
in
the
world
hump
meat
from
a
cow
buffalo
not
too
old
cut
in
slices
and
fried
in
batter
la
is
delicious
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
we
had
tongues
in
plenty
but
the
ordinary
meat
was
so
good
they
were
not
half
appreciated
of
course
the
tenderloin
was
above
criticism
and
even
the
round
steaks
so
lightly
esteemed
by
the
epicure
were
tender
and
juicy
to
a
most
satisfactory
degree
it
has
been
said
that
the
meat
of
the
buffalo
has
a
coarser
texture
or
grain
than
domestic
beef
although
i
expected
to
find
such
to
be
the
case
i
found
no
perceptible
difference
whatever
nor
do
i
believe
that
any
exists
as
to
the
distribution
of
fat
i
am
unable
to
say
for
the
reason
that
our
buffaloes
were
not
fat
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
distribution
of
fat
through
the
meat
so
characteristic
of
the
shorthorn
breeds
and
which
has
been
brought
about
only
by
careful
breeding
is
not
found
in
either
the
beef
of
the
buffalo
or
common
range
cattle
in
this
respect
shorthorn
beef
no
doubt
surpasses
both
the
others
mentioned
but
in
all
other
points
texture
flavor
and
general
tenderness
i
am
very
sure
it
does
not
it
is
a
great
mistake
for
a
traveler
to
kill
a
patriarchal
old
bull
buffalo
and
after
attempting
to
masticate
a
small
portion
of
him
to
rise
up
and
declare
that
buffalo
meat
is
coarse
tough
and
dry
a
domestic
bull
of
the
same
age
would
taste
as
tough
it
is
probably
only
those
who
have
had
the
bad
taste
to
eat
who
have
ever
found
occasion
to
asperse
the
reputation
of
as
a
beef
animal
until
people
got
tired
of
them
buffalo
tongues
were
in
considerable
demand
and
hundreds
if
not
even
thousands
of
barrels
of
them
were
shipped
east
from
the
buffalo
country
out
of
the
enormous
waste
of
good
buffalo
flesh
one
product
stands
forth
as
a
redeeming
feature
pemmican
although
made
almost
exclusively
by
the
and
indians
of
the
northwest
it
constituted
a
regular
article
of
commerce
of
great
value
to
overland
travelers
and
was
much
sought
for
as
long
as
it
was
produced
its
peculiar
staying
powers
due
to
the
process
of
its
manufacture
which
yielded
a
most
nourishing
food
in
a
highly
condensed
form
made
it
of
inestimable
value
to
the
overland
traveler
who
must
travel
light
or
not
at
all
a
handful
of
pemmican
was
sufficient
food
to
constitute
a
meal
when
provisions
were
at
all
scarce
the
price
of
pemmican
in
winnipeg
was
once
as
low
as
per
pound
but
in
a
very
small
quantity
which
was
brought
in
sold
at
cents
per
pound
this
was
probably
the
last
buffalo
pemmican
made
robinson
states
that
in
pemmican
was
worth
per
pound
the
manufacture
of
pemmican
as
performed
by
the
red
river
was
thus
described
by
the

other
portions
which
are

pemmican
are
exposed
to
an
ardent
heat
and
thus
become
brittle
and
easily
reducible
to
small
particles

the
use
of

described
to
be
very
palatable

taurean
of
pemmican
weighs
from
to
pounds
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
immense
destruction
of
buffalo
by
these
people
when
it
is
stated
that
a
whole
cow
yields
a
bag
of
pemmican
and
three
fourths
of
a
bundle
of
dried
meat
so
that
the
most
economical
calculate
that
from
eight
to
ten
cows
are
required
for
the
load
of
a
single
vehicle
it
is
quite
evident
from
the
testimony
of
disinterested
travelers
that
ordinary
pemmican
was
not
very
palatable
to
one
unaccustomed
to
it
as
a
regular
article
of
food
to
the
natives
however
especially
the
canadian
it
formed
one
of
the
most
valuable
food
products
of
the
country
and
it
is
said
that
the
demand
for
it
was
generally
greater
than
the
supply
or
jerked
the
most
popular
and
universal
method
of
curing
buffalo
meat
was
to
cut
it
into
thin
flakes
an
inch
or
less
in
thickness
and
of
indefinite
length
and
without
salting
it
in
the
least
to
hang
it
over
poles
ropes
or
even
clumps
of
standing
sage
brush
and
let
it
dry
in
the
sun
this
process
yielded
the
famous
jerked
meat
so
common
throughout
the
west
in
the
early
days
from
the
rio
grande
to
the
saskatchewan
father
belcourt
thus
described
the
curing
process
as
it
was
practiced
by
the
and
indians
of
the
northwest
the
meat
when
taken
to
camp
is
cut
by
the
women
into
long
strips
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
which
are
hung
upon
the
prepared
for
that
purpose
to
dry
this
is
formed
of
small
pieces
of
wood
placed
horizontally
transversely
and
equidistant
from
each
other
not
unlike
an
immense
gridiron
and
is
supported
by
wooden
uprights
trepieds
in
a
few
days
the
meat
is
thoroughly
desiccated
when
it
is
bent
into
proper
lengths
and
tied
into
bundles
of
or
pounds
weight
this
is
called
dried
meat
viande
seche
to
make
the
hide
into
parchment
so
called
it
is
stretched
on
a
frame
and
then
scraped
on
the
inside
with
a
piece
of
sharpened
bone
and
on
the
outside
with
a
small
but
iron
proper
to
remove
the
hair
this
is
considered
likewise
the
appropriate
labor
of
women

men
break
the
bones
which
are
boiled
in
water
to
extract
the
marrow
to
be
used

purposes

the
northwest
territories
dried
meat
which
formerly
sold
at
per
pound
was
worth
in
per
pound
although
i
have
myself
prepared
quite
a
quantity
of
jerked
buffalo
meat
i
never
learned
to
like
it
owing
to
the
absence
of
salt
in
its
curing
the
dried
meat
when
pounded
and
made
into
a
stew
has
a
far
away
taste
which
continually
reminds
one
of
hoofs
and
horns
for
all
that
and
despite
its
resemblance
in
flavor
to
liebig
extract
of
beef
it
is
quite
good
and
better
to
the
taste
than
ordinary
pemmican
the
indians
formerly
cured
great
quantities
of
buffalo
meat
in
this
way
in
summer
of
course
for
use
in
winter
but
the
advent
of
that
popular
institution
called
government
beef
long
ago
rendered
it
unnecessary
for
the
noble
red
man
to
exert
his
squaw
in
that
once
honorable
field
of
labor
during
the
existence
of
the
buffalo
herds
a
few
thrifty
and
enterprising
white
men
made
a
business
of
killing
buffaloes
in
summer
and
drying
the
meat
in
bulk
in
the
same
manner
which
produces
our
popular
dried
beef
allen
states
that
a
single
hunter
at
hays
city
shipped
annually
for
some
years
several
hundred
barrels
thus
prepared
which
the
consumers
probably
bought
for
ordinary
beef

bison
numerous
attempts
have
been
made
to
utilize
the
woolly
hair
of
the
bison
in
the
manufacture
of
textile
fabrics
as
early
as
william
byrd
records
the
fact
that

were
made

material

long
and
shagged

men
on
a
liberal
scale
for
the
utilization
of

its
manufacture
into

an
account
of
which
appears
in
ross
red
river
settlement
pp
in
some
of
the
more
enterprising
of
the
red
river
british
colonists
conceived
the
idea
of
making
fortunes
out
of
the
manufacture
of
woolen
goods
from
the
fleece
of
the
buffalo
and
for
that
purpose
organized
the
buffalo
wool
company
the
principal
object
of
which
was
declared
to
be
to
provide
a
substitute
for
wool
which
substitute
was
to
be
the
wool
of
the
wild
buffalo
which
was
to
be
collected
in
the
plains
and
manufactured
both
for
the
use
of
the
colonists
and
for
export
a
large
number
of
skilled
workmen
of
various
kinds
were
procured
from
england
and
also
a
plant
of
machinery
and
materials
when
too
late
it
was
found
that
the
supply
of
buffalo
wool
obtainable
was
utterly
insufficient
the
raw
wool
costing
the
company
per
pound
and
cloth
which
it
cost
the
company
per
yard
to
produce
was
worth
only
per
yard
in
england
the
historian
states
that
universal
drunkenness
on
the
part
of
all
concerned
aided
very
materially
in
bringing
about
the
total
failure
of
the
enterprise

short

a
sufficient
supply
of
the
raw
material
could
be
obtained

is
and
always
has
been
impossible
nothing
could
be
more
visionary
than

thus
produce

universally
known
as
buffalo
chips
when
over
one
year
old
and
thoroughly
dry
this
material
makes
excellent
fuel
usually
it
occurs
only
where
is
unobtainable
and
thousands
of
frontiersmen
have
a
million
times
found
it
of
priceless
value
when
dry
it
catches
easily
burns
readily
and
makes
a
hot
fire
with
but
very
little
smoke
although
it
is
rapidly
consumed
although
not
as
good
for
a
fire
as
even
the
poorest
timber
it
is
infinitely
better
than
which
in
the
absence
of
chips
is
often
the
traveler
last
resort
it
usually
happens
that
chips
are
in
the
sheltered
and
near
the
the
very
situations
which
travelers
naturally
select
for
their
camps
in
these
spots
the
herds
have
gathered
either
for
shelter
in
winter
or
for
water
in
summer
and
remained
in
a
body
for
some
hours
and
now
when
the
cowboy
on
the
the
surveyor
or
hunter
who
must
camp
out
pitches
his
tent
in
the
grassy
coulée
or
narrow
his
first
care
is
to
start
out
with
his
largest
gunning
bag
to
rustle
some
buffalo
chips
for
a
campfire
he
at
least
when
he
returns
well
laden
with
the
spoil
of
his
humble
chase
still
has
good
reason
to
remember
the
departed
herd
with
feelings
of
gratitude
thus
even
the
last
remains
of
this
most
useful
animal
are
utilized
by
man
in
providing
for
his
own
imperative
wants
ix
the
present
value
of
the
bison
to
bison
in
captivity
and
almost
from
time
immemorial
it
has
been
known
that
the
american
bison
takes
kindly
to
captivity
herds
contentedly
with
domestic
cattle
and
crosses
with
them
with
the
utmost
readiness
it
was
formerly
believed
and
indeed
the
tradition
prevails
even
now
to
quite
an
extent
that
on
account
of
the
hump
on
the
shoulders
a
domestic
cow
could
not
give
birth
to
a
calf
this
belief
is
entirely
without
foundation
and
is
due
to
theories
rather
than
facts
numerous
experiments
in
buffalo
breeding
have
been
made
and
the
subject
is
far
from
being
a
new
one
as
early
as
the
huguenot
settlers
at
manikintown
on
the
james
river
a
few
miles
above
richmond
began
to
domesticate
buffaloes
it
is
also
a
matter
of
historical
record
that
in
or
thereabouts
buffaloes
were
domesticated
and
bred
in
captivity
in
virginia
and
albert
gallatin
states
that
in
some
of
the
northwestern
counties
the
mixed
breed
was
quite
common
in
a
series
of
elaborate
and
valuable
experiments
in
the
buffalo
and
domestic
cattle
was
begun
by
robert
wickliffe
of
lexington
and
continued
by
him
for
upwards
of
thirty
years

quite
recently
the
operations
of
bedson
of
stony
mountain
manitoba
and
jones
of
garden
city
have
attracted
much
attention
particularly
for
the
reason
that
the
efforts
of
both
these
gentlemen
have
been
directed
toward
the
practical
improvement
of
the
present
breeds
of
range
cattle
for
this
reason
the
importance
of
the
work
in
which
they
are
engaged
can
hardly
be
overestimated
and
the
results
already
obtained
by
bedson
whose
experiments
antedate
those
of
jones
by
several
years
are
of
the
greatest
interest
to
western
indeed
unless
the
stock
of
buffaloes
now
remaining
proves
insufficient
for
the
purpose
i
fully
believe
that
we
will
gradually
see
a
great
change
wrought
in
the
character
of
western
cattle
by
the
introduction
of
a
strain
of
buffalo
blood
the
experiments
which
have
been
made
thus
far
prove
conclusively
that
the
male
bison
crosses
readily
with
the
opposite
sex
of
domestic
cattle
but
a
buffalo
cow
has
never
been
known
to
produce
a
calf
the
domestic
cow
produces
a
calf
successfully
the
progeny
of
the
two
species
is
fertile
to
any
extent
yielding
quarter
breeds
and
so
on
the
bison
breeds
in
captivity
with
perfect
regularity
and
success
of
an
improvement
in
range
ever
since
the
earliest
days
of
in
the
west
stockmen
have
had
it
in
their
power
to
produce
a
breed
which
would
equal
in
qualities
the
best
breeds
to
be
found
upon
the
plains
and
be
so
much
better
calculated
to
survive
the
hardships
of
winter
that
their
annual
losses
would
have
been
very
greatly
reduced
whenever
there
is
an
unusually
severe
winter
such
as
comes
about
three
times
in
every
decade
if
not
even
oftener
range
cattle
perish
by
thousands
it
is
an
absolute
impossibility
for
every
ranchman
who
owns
several
thousand
or
even
several
hundred
head
of
cattle
to
provide
hay
for
them
even
during
the
severest
portion
of
the
winter
season
and
consequently
the
cattle
must
depend
wholly
upon
their
own
resources
when
the
winter
is
reasonably
mild
and
the
snows
never
very
deep
nor
lying
too
long
at
a
time
on
the
ground
the
cattle
live
through
the
winter
with
very
satisfactory
success
thanks
to
the
wind
it
usually
happens
that
the
falling
snow
is
blown
off
the
ridges
as
fast
as
it
falls
leaving
the
grass
sufficiently
uncovered
for
the
cattle
to
feed
upon
it
if
the
is
universal
but
not
more
than
a
few
inches
in
depth
the
cattle
paw
through
it
here
and
there
and
eke
out
a
subsistence
on
quarter
rations
it
may
be
until
a
friendly
chinook
wind
sets
in
from
the
southwest
and
dissolves
the
snow
as
if
by
magic
in
a
few
hours
time
but
when
a
deep
snow
comes
and
lies
on
the
ground
persistently
week
in
and
week
out
when
the
warmth
of
the
sun
softens
and
moistens
its
surface
sufficiently
for
a
returning
cold
wave
to
freeze
it
into
a
hard
crust
forming
a
universal
wall
of
ice
between
the
luckless
steer
and
his
only
food
the
cattle
starve
and
freeze
in
immense
numbers
being
totally
unfitted
by
nature
to
survive
such
unnatural
conditions
it
is
not
strange
that
they
succumb
under
present
conditions
the
stockman
simply
stakes
his
cattle
against
the
winter
elements
and
takes
his
chances
on
the
results
which
are
governed
by
circumstances
wholly
beyond
his
control
the
losses
of
the
fearful
winter
of
will
probably
never
be
forgotten
by
the
cattlemen
of
the
great
western
grazing
ground
in
many
portions
of
montana
and
wyoming
the
cattlemen
admitted
a
loss
of
per
cent
of
their
cattle
and
in
some
localities
the
loss
was
still
greater
the
same
conditions
are
liable
to
prevail
next
winter
or
any
succeeding
winter
and
we
may
yet
see
more
than
half
the
range
cattle
in
the
west
perish
in
a
single
month
yet
all
this
time
the
cattlemen
have
had
it
in
their
power
by
the
easiest
and
simplest
method
in
the
world
to
introduce
a
strain
of
hardy
native
blood
in
their
stock
which
would
have
made
it
capable
of
successfully
resisting
a
much
greater
degree
of
hunger
and
cold
it
is
really
surprising
that
the
desirability
of
the
buffalo
and
domestic
cattle
should
for
so
long
a
time
have
been
either
overlooked
or
disregarded
while
generally
have
shown
the
greatest
enterprise
in
producing
special
breeds
for
milk
for
butter
or
for
beef
cattle
with
short
horns
and
cattle
with
no
horns
at
all
only
two
or
three
men
have
had
the
enterprise
to
try
to
produce
a
breed
particularly
hardy
and
capable
a
buffalo
can
weather
storms
and
outlive
hunger
and
cold
which
would
kill
any
domestic
steer
that
ever
lived
when
nature
placed
him
on
the
treeless
and
plains
she
left
him
well
equipped
to
survive
whatever
natural
conditions
he
would
have
to
encounter
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
entire
is
his
magnificent
suit
of
hair
and
fur
combined
the
warmest
covering
possessed
by
any
quadruped
save
the
the
head
neck
and
fore
quarters
are
clothed
with
hide
and
hair
so
thick
as
to
be
almost
if
not
entirely
impervious
to
cold
the
hair
on
the
body
and
hind
quarters
is
long
fine
very
thick
and
of
that
peculiar
woolly
quality
which
constitutes
the
best
possible
protection
against
cold
let
him
who
doubts
the
warmth
of
a
good
buffalo
robe
try
to
weather
a
blizzard
with
something
else
and
then
try
the
robe
the
very
form
of
the
buffalo
short
thick
legs
and
head
hung
very
near
the
ground
suggests
most
forcibly
a
special
fitness
to
wrestle
with
mother
earth
for
a
living
snow
or
no
snow
a
buffalo
will
flounder
for
days
through
deep
without
a
morsel
of
food
and
survive
where
the
best
range
steer
would
literally
freeze
on
foot
bolt
upright
as
hundreds
did
in
the
winter
of
while
range
cattle
turn
tail
to
a
blizzard
and
drift
helplessly
the
buffalo
faces
it
every
time
and
remains
master
of
the
situation
it
has
for
years
been
a
surprise
to
me
that
western
stockmen
have
not
seized
upon
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
presence
of
the
buffalo
to
improve
the
character
of
their
cattle
now
that
there
are
no
longer
any
buffalo
calves
to
be
had
on
the
plains
for
the
trouble
of
catching
them
and
the
few
domesticated
buffaloes
that
remain
are
worth
fabulous
prices
we
may
expect
to
see
a
great
deal
of
interest
manifested
in
this
subject
and
some
costly
efforts
made
to
atone
for
previous
lack
of
forethought

photograph
kindly
furnished
by
jones

a
ten
months
old
calf
male
the
product
of
a
buffalo
bull
and
domestic
cow
the
prepotency
of
the
sire
is
apparent
at
the
first
glance
and
to
so
marked
an
extent
that
the
illustration
would
pass
muster
anywhere
as
having
been
drawn
from
a
buffalo
the
head
neck
and
hump
and
the
long
woolly
hair
that
covers
them
proclaim
the
buffalo
in
every
line
excepting
that
the
hair
on
the
shoulders
below
the
hump
is
of
the
same
length
as
that
on
the
body
and
hind
quarters
there
is
so
far
as
one
can
judge
from
an
excellent
photograph
no
difference
whatever
observable
between
this
lusty
young
and
a
full
blood
buffalo
calf
of
the
same
age
and
sex
jones
describes
the
color
of
this
animal
as
and
remarks
you
will
see
how
even
the
fur
is
being
as
long
on
the
hind
parts
as
on
the
shoulders
and
neck
very
much
unlike
the
buffalo
which
is
so
shaggy
about
the
shoulders
and
so
thin
farther
back
upon
this
point
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
hair
on
the
body
of
a
yearling
or
two
buffalo
is
always
very
much
longer
in
proportion
to
the
hair
on
the
forward
parts
than
it
is
later
in
life
and
while
the
shoulder
hair
is
always
decidedly
longer
than
that
back
of
it
during
the
first
two
years
the
contrast
is
by
no
means
so
very
great
a
reference
to
the
memoranda
of
hair
measurements
already
given
will
afford
precise
data
on
this
point
in
regard
to
calves
bedson
states
in
a
private
letter
that
the
hump
does
not
appear
until
several
months
after
birth
altogether
the
male
calf
described
above
so
strongly
resembles
a
buffalo
as
to
be
generally
mistaken
for
one

proclaims
her
origin
the
accompanying

six
years

about
pounds

is
very
noticeably
larger
in
proportion
than
that
of
the

her

much
heavier
broader
and
more

being
a
decided
improvement
upon
the
small

of
the
wild
species
the
hump
is
quite
noticeable

is
not
nearly
so
high
as
in
the
pure

the
hair
on

in

the
nucleus
of

consisted
of

and
four
heifer

the
increase
from

has
been
most
rapid
as
will
be
shown
by
a

statement
farther
on
success
with
the
breeding
of
the
pure
buffalo
was
followed
by
experiments
in
crossing
with
the
domestic
animal
this
crossing
has
generally
been
between
a
buffalo
bull
and
an
ordinary
cow
and
with
the
most
encouraging
results
since
it
had
been
contended
by
many
that
although
the
cow
might
breed
a
calf
from
the
buffalo
yet
it
would
be
at
the
expense
of
her
life
owing
to
the
hump
on
a
buffalo
shoulder
but
this
hump
does
not
appear
until
several
months
after
birth
this
has
been
proved
a
fallacy
respecting
at
least
for
calving
has
been
attended
with
no
greater
percentage
of
losses
than
would
be
experienced
in
ranching

dropped

annually
they

indeed
as
they
take
the
instinct
of

and
do
not
drift

they
remain
upon

severest
winters
while
the
thermometer
ranges
from

what

rustled
on

is
imperative

more

creating
an
item

all

the

half

retains
all
its
native
hardihood
needs
no
housing
forages
in
the
deepest

for
its

becomes
easily
domesticated

consequently
needs
but
little
herding
therefore
the

of
the

is
easily
reared
cheaply

requires
no

for
him
the
sobriquet
of
buffalo
jones
five
years
ago
became
deeply
interested
in
the
question
of
improving
range
cattle
by
crossing
with
the
buffalo
with
characteristic
western
energy
he
has
pursued
the
subject
from
that
time
until
the
present
having
made
five
trips
to
the
range
of
the
only
buffaloes
remaining
from
the
great
southern
herd
and
captured
buffalo
calves
and
eleven
adult
cows
with
which
to
start
a
herd
in
a
short
article
published
in
the
farmers
review
chicago
august
jones
gives
his
views
on
the
value
of
the
buffalo
in
as
follows
in
all
my
meanderings
i
have
not
found
a
place
but
i
could
count
more
carcasses
of
cattle
than
living
animals
who
has
not
ridden
over
some
of
the
western
railways
and
counted
dead
cattle
by
the
thousands
the
great
question
is
where
can
we
get
a
race
of
cattle
that
will
stand
blizzards
and
endure
the
drifting
snow
and
will
not
be
driven
with
the
storms
against
the
railroad
fences
and
pasture
fences
there
to
perish
for
the
want
of
nerve
to
face
the
northern
winds
for
a
few
miles
to
where
the
winter
grasses
could
be
had
in
abundance
realizing
these
facts
both
from
observation
and
pocket
we
pulled
on
our
cap
and
these
points
came
vividly
to
our
mind
we
want
an
animal
that
is
hardy
we
want
an
animal
with
nerve
and
endurance
we
want
an
animal
that
faces
the
blizzards
and
endures
the
storms
we
want
an
animal
that
will
rustle
the
prairies
and
not
yield
to
discouragement
we
want
an
animal
that
will
fill
the
above
bill
and
make
good
beef
and
plenty
of
it

all
the
points
above
could
easily
be
found
in
the
buffalo
excepting
the
fifth
and
even
that
is
more
than
filled
as
to
the
quality
but
not
in
quantity
where
is
the
timer
who
has
not
had
a
cut
from
the
hump
or
sirloin
of
a
fat
buffalo
cow
in
the
fall
of
the
year
and
where
is
the
one
who
will
not
make
affidavit
that
it
was
the
best
meat
he
ever
ate
yes
the
fat
was
very
rich
equal
to
the
marrow
from
the
bone
of
domestic
cattle
the
great
question
remained
unsolved
as
to
the
quantity
of
meat
from
the
buffalo
i
finally
heard
of
a
buffalo
in
colorado
and
immediately
set
out
to
find
it
i
traveled
at
least
miles
to
find
it
and
found
a
cow
that
had
been
bred
to
domestic
bulls
and
had
brought
forth
two
calves
a
yearling
and
a
sucking
calf
that
gave
promise
of
great
results
the
cow
had
never
been
fed
but
depended
altogether
on
the
range
and
when
i
saw
her
in
the
fall
of
i
estimated
her
weight
at
pounds
she
was
a
brindle
and
had
a
handsome
robe
even
in
september
she
had
as
good
hind
quarters
as
ordinary
cattle
her
foreparts
were
heavy
and
resembled
the
buffalo
yet
not
near
so
much
of
the
hump
the
offspring
showed
but
very
little
of
the
buffalo
yet
they
possessed
a
woolly
coat
which
showed
clearly
that
they
were
more
than
domestic
cattle
what
we
can
rely
on
by
having
and
breeds
might
be
analyzed
as
follows
we
can
depend
upon
a
race
of
cattle
unequaled
in
the
world
for
hardiness
and
durability
a
good
animal
the
best
and
only
animal
of
the
bovine
race
the
animal
always
found
in
a
storm
where
it
is
overtaken
by
it
a
race
of
cattle
so
clannish
as
never
to
separate
and
go
astray
the
animal
that
can
always
have
free
range
as
they
exist
where
no
other
animal
can
live
the
animal
that
can
water
every
third
day
and
keep
fat
ranging
from
to
miles
from
water
in
fact
they
are
the
perfect
animal
for
the
plains
of
north
america
breeds
for
texas
breeds
for
colorado
and
kansas
and
breeds
for
more
northern
country
is
what
will
soon
be
sought
after
more
than
any
living
animal
then
we
will
never
be
confronted
with
dead
carcarsses
from
starvation
exhaustion
and
lack
of
nerve
as
in
years
gone
by
bison
as
a
beast
of
on
account
of
the
abundance
of
horses
for
all
purposes
throughout
the
entire
country
oxen
are
so
seldom
used
they
almost
constitute
a
curiosity
there
never
has
existed
a
necessity
to
break
buffaloes
to
the
yoke
and
work
them
like
domestic
oxen
and
so
few
experiments
have
been
made
in
this
direction
that
reliable
data
on
this
subject
is
almost
wholly
wanting
while
at
miles
city
i
heard
of
a
german
granger
who
worked
a
small
farm
in
the
tongue
river
valley
and
who
once
had
a
pair
of
cow
buffaloes
trained
to
the
yoke
it
was
said
that
they
were
strong
rapid
walkers
and
capable
of
performing
as
much
work
as
the
best
domestic
oxen
but
they
were
at
times
so
uncontrollably
headstrong
and
obstinate
as
to
greatly
detract
from
their
usefulness
the
particular
event
of
their
career
on
which
their
historian
dwelt
with
special
interest
occurred
when
their
owner
was
hauling
a
load
of
potatoes
to
town
with
them
in
the
course
of
the
long
drive
the
buffaloes
grew
very
thirsty
and
upon
coming
within
sight
of
the
water
in
the
river
they
started
for
it
in
a
straight
course
the
shouts
and
blows
of
the
driver
only
served
to
hasten
their
speed
and
presently
when
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
high
bank
they
plunged
down
it
without
the
slightest
hesitation
wagon
potatoes
and
all
to
the
loss
of
everything
except
themselves
and
the
drink
they
went
after
robert
wickliffe
states
that
trained
buffaloes
make
satisfactory
oxen
i
have
broken
them
to
the
yoke
and
found
them
capable
of
making
excellent
oxen
and
for
drawing
wagons
carts
or
other
heavily
laden
vehicles
on
long
journeys
they
would
i
think
be
greatly
preferable
to
the
common
ox
it
seems
probable
that
in
the
absence
of
horses
the
buffalo
would
make
a
much
more
speedy
and
enduring
draught
animal
than
the
domestic
ox
although
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
he
would
be
as
strong
his
weaker
pelvis
and
hind
quarters
would
surely
count
against
him
under
certain
circumstances
but
for
some
purposes
his
superior
speed
and
endurance
would
more
than
counterbalance
that
defect

to
the
uninhabited
panhandle
of
texas
to
capture
calves
out
of
the
small
herd
of
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
head
which
represented
the
last
remnant
of
the
great
southern
herd
each
of
these
expeditious
involved
a
very
considerable
outlay
in
money
an
elaborate
outfit
of
men
horses
vehicles
camp
equipage
and
lastly
but
most
important
of
all
a
herd
of
a
dozen
fresh
milch
cows
to
nourish
the
captured
calves
and
keep
them
from
dying
of
starvation
and
thirst
the
region
visited
was
fearfully
barren
almost
without
water
and
to
penetrate
it
was
always
attended
by
great
hardship
the
buffaloes
were
difficult
to
find
but
the
ground
was
good
for
running
being
chiefly
level
plains
and
the
superior
speed
of
the
running
horses
always
enabled
the
hunters
to
overtake
a
herd
whenever
one
was
sighted
and
to
cut
out
and
lasso
two
three
or
four
of
its
calves
the
degree
of
skill
and
daring
displayed
in
these
several
expeditions
are
worthy
of
the
highest
admiration
and
completely
surpass
anything
i
have
ever
seen
or
read
of
being
accomplished
in
connection
with
hunting
or
the
capture
of
live
game
the
latest
feat
of
jones
and
his
party
comes
the
nearest
to
being
incredible
during
the
month
of
may
they
not
only
captured
seven
calves
but
also
adult
of
which
some
were
lassoed
in
full
career
on
the
prairie
thrown
tied
and
hobbled
the
majority
however
were
actually
rounded
up
herded
and
held
in
control
until
a
bunch
of
tame
buffaloes
was
driven
down
to
meet
them
so
that
it
would
thus
be
possible
to
drive
all
together
to
a
ranch
this
brilliant
feat
can
only
be
appreciated
as
it
deserves
by
those
who
have
lately
hunted
buffalo
and
learned
by
dear
experience
the
extent
of
their
wariness
and
the
difficulties
to
say
nothing
of
the

inseparably
connected

anxiety
to
dispose
of
them
at
any
figures
the
railroad

has
been
glad
to
furnish

the

of
adding

the

decidedly
the
pride

as
grand
a

as
ever
trod

he

there
is
royal
blood
in

his
coat
is
finer
than
the

it
is
not
possible
to
get
at
him
to
measure
his
stature
and
weight
he
must
weigh
fully
pounds

it
is
doubtful
if
there
is
living
on
the

of
the

a
handsomer
buffalo
bull
than
he
cleveland
disposition
is
not

ugly

at

he
is

enough

it

then
not
altogether
safe
to

causes
of

the
causes
which
led
to
the
practical
extinction
in

state
at
least
of
the
most
economically
valuable
wild
animal
that
ever
inhabited
the
american
continent
are
by
no
means
obscure
it
is
well
that
we
should
know
precisely
what
they
were
and
by
the
sad
fate
of
the
buffalo
be
warned
in
time
against
allowing
similar
causes
to
produce
the
same
results
with
our
elk
antelope
deer
moose
caribou
mountain
sheep
mountain
goat
walrus
and
other
animals
it
will
be
doubly
deplorable
if
the
remorseless
slaughter
we
have
witnessed
during
the
last
twenty
years
carries
with
it
no
lessons
for
the
future
a
continuation
of
the
record
we
have
lately
made
as
wholesale
game
butchers
will
justify
posterity
in
dating
us
back
with
the
and
when
man
only
known
function
was
to
slay
and
eat
the
primary
cause
of
the
buffalo
extermination
and
the
one
which
embraced
all
others
was
the
descent
of
civilization
with
all
its
elements
of
destructiveness
upon
the
whole
of
the
country
inhabited
by
that
animal
from
the
great
slave
lake
to
the
rio
grande
the
home
of
the
buffalo
was
everywhere
overrun
by
the
man
with
a
gun
and
as
has
ever
been
the
case
the
wild
creatures
were
gradually
swept
away
the
largest
and
most
conspicuous
forms
being
the
first
to
go
the
secondary
causes
of
the
extermination
of
the
buffalo
may
be
catalogued
as
follows
man
reckless
greed
his
wanton
destructiveness
and
improvidence
in
not
husbanding
such
resources
as
come
to
him
from
the
hand
of
nature
ready
made
the
total
and
utterly
inexcusable
absence
of
protective
measures
and
agencies
on
the
part
of
the
national
government
and
of
the
west
states
and
territories
the
fatal
preference
on
the
part
of
hunters
generally
both
white
and
red
for
the
robe
and
flesh
of
the
cow
over
that
furnished
by
the
bull
the
phenomenal
stupidity
of
the
animals
themselves
and
their
indifference
to
man
the
perfection
of
modern
rifles
and
other
sporting
in
general
each
of
these
causes
acted
against
the
buffalo
with
its
fall
force
to
offset
which
there
was
even
restraining
or
preserving
influence
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
species
went
down
before
them
had
any
one
of
these
conditions
been
eliminated
the
result
would
have
been
reached
far
less
quickly
had
the
buffalo
for
example
possessed
the
fighting
qualities
of
the
grizzly
bear
he
would
have
fared
very
differently
but
his
inoffensiveness
and
lack
of
courage
almost
leads
one
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
the
economy
of
nature
so
far
as
it
relates
to
him
ii
methods
of
slaughter
of
all
the
deadly
methods
of
buffalo
slaughter
the
was
the
deadliest
of
all
the
methods
that
were
unsportsmanlike
unfair
ignoble
and
utterly
reprehensible
this
was
in
every
respect
the
lowest
and
the
worst
destitute
of
nearly
every
element
of
the
buoyant
excitement
and
spice
of
danger
that
accompanied
genuine
buffalo
hunting
on
horseback
the
was
mere
butchery
of
the
tamest
and
yet
most
cruel
kind
about
it
there
was
none
of
the
true
excitement
of
the
chase
but
there
was
plenty
of
greedy
eagerness
to
down
as
many
head
as
possible
every
day
just
as
there
is
in
every
where
the
killers
are
paid
so
much
per
head
judging
from
all
accounts
it
was
about
as
exciting
and
dangerous
work
as
it
would
be
to
go
out
now
and
shoot
cattle
on
the
texas
or
montana
ranges
the
probabilities
are
however
that
shooting
texas
cattle
would
be
the
most
dangerous
for
instead
of
running
from
a
man
on
foot
as
the
buffalo
used
to
do
range
cattle
usually
charge
down
upon
him
from
motives
of
curiosity
perhaps
and
not
infrequently
place
his
life
in
considerable
jeopardy
the
buffalo
owes
his
extermination
very
largely
to
his
own
unparalleled
stupidity
for
nothing
else
could
by
any
possibility
have
enabled
the
to
accomplish
what
they
did
in
such
an
incredibly
short
time
so
long
as
the
chase
on
horseback
was
the
order
of
the
day
it
ordinarily
required
the
united
efforts
of
from
fifteen
to
hunters
to
kill
a
thousand
buffalo
in
a
single
season
but
a
single
with
a
who
knew
how
to
make
a
sneak
and
get
a
stand
on
a
bunch
often
succeeded
in
killing
from
one
to
three
thousand
in
one
season
by
his
own
unaided
efforts
capt
jack
brydges
of
kansas
who
was
one
of
the
first
to
begin
the
final
slaughter
of
the
southern
herd
killed
by
contract
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
buffaloes
in
six
weeks
so
long
as
the
buffalo
remained
in
large
herds
their
numbers
gave
each
individual
a
feeling
of
dependence
upon
his
fellows
and
of
general
security
from
harm
even
in
the
presence
of
strange
phenomena
which
he
could
not
understand
when
he
heard
a
loud
report
and
saw
a
little
cloud
of
white
smoke
rising
from
a
gully
a
clump
of
or
the
top
of
a
ridge
yards
away
he
wondered
what
it
meant
and
held
himself
in
readiness
to
follow
his
leader
in
case
she
should
run
away
but
when
the
leader
of
the
herd
usually
the
oldest
cow
fell
bleeding
upon
the
ground
and
no
other
buffalo
promptly
assumed
the
leadership
of
the
herd
instead
of
acting
independently
and
fleeing
from
the
alarm
he
merely
did
as
he
saw
the
others
do
and
waited
his
turn
to
be
shot
latterly
however
when
the
herds
were
totally
broken
up
when
the
few
survivors
were
scattered
in
every
direction
and
it
became
a
case
of
every
buffalo
for
himself
they
became
wild
and
wary
ever
ready
to
start
off
at
the
slightest
alarm
and
run
indefinitely
had
they
shown
the
same
wariness
seventeen
years
ago
that
the
survivors
have
manifested
during
the
last
three
or
four
years
there
would
now
be
a
hundred
thousand
head
alive
instead
of
only
about
three
hundred
in
a
wild
and
unprotected
state
notwithstanding
the
merciless
war
that
had
been
waged
against
the
buffalo
for
over
a
century
by
both
whites
and
indians
and
the
steady
decrease
of
its
numbers
as
well
as
its
range
there
were
several
million
head
on
foot
not
only
up
to
the
completion
of
the
union
pacific
railway
but
as
late
as
the
year
up
to
that
time
the
killing
done
by
white
men
had
been
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
meat
the
demand
for
robes
was
moderate
and
the
indians
took
annually
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
for
trading
although
half
a
million
buffaloes
were
killed
by
indians
and
whites
the
natural
increase
was
so
very
considerable
as
to
make
it
seem
that
the
evil
day
of
extermination
was
yet
far
distant
but
by
a
coincidence
which
was
fatal
to
the
buffalo
with
the
building
of
three
lines
of
railway
through
the
most
populous
buffalo
country
there
came
a
demand
for
robes
and
hides
backed
up
by
an
unlimited
supply
of
new
and
marvellously
accurate
rifles
and
fixed
ammunition
and
then
followed
a
wild
rush
of
hunters
to
the
buffalo
country
eager
to
destroy
as
many
head
as
possible
in
the
shortest
time
for
those
greedy
ones
the
chase
on
horseback
was
too
slow
and
too
unfruitful
that
was
a
retail
method
of
killing
whereas
they
wanted
to
kill
by
wholesale
from
their
point
of
view
the
or
sneak
hunt
was
the
method
if
they
could
have
obtained
gatling
guns
with
which
to
mow
down
a
whole
herd
at
a
time
beyond
a
doubt
they
would
have
gladly
used
them
the
was
seen
at
its
very
worst
in
the
years
and
on
the
southern
buffalo
range
and
ten
years
later
at
its
best
in
montana
on
the
northern
let
us
first
consider
it
at
its
best
which
in
principle
was
bad
enough
the
great
rise
in
the
price
of
robes
which
followed
the
blotting
out
of
the
great
southern
herd
at
once
put
on
a
much
more
comfortable
and
respectable
business
basis
in
the
north
than
it
had
ever
occupied
in
the
south
where
prices
had
all
along
been
phenomenally
low
in
montana
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
hunter
to
invest
from
to
in
his
outfit
of
horses
wagons
weapons
ammunition
provisions
and
sundries
one
of
the
men
who
accompanied
the
smithsonian
expedition
for
buffalo
james
mcnaney
of
miles
city
montana
was
an
banter
who
had
spent
three
seasons
on
the
northern
range
killing
buffalo
for
their
robes
and
his
standing
as
a
hunter
was
of
the
best
a
brief
description
of
his
outfit
and
its
work
during
its
last
season
on
the
range
may
fairly
be
taken
as
a
typical
illustration
of
the
life
and
work
of
the
at
its
best
the
only
thing
against
it
was
the
extermination
of
the
buffalo
during
the
winters
of
and
mcnaney
had
served
in
outfit
as
a
hunter
working
by
the
month
but
his
success
in
killing
was
such
that
he
decided
to
work
the
third
year
on
his
own
account
although
at
that
time
only
seventeen
years
of
age
he
took
an
elder
brother
as
a
partner
and
purchased
an
outfit
in
miles
city
of
which
the
following
were
the
principal
items
two

started

city
on
november
which
was
considered
a
very
late
start
the
usual
time
of
setting
out
for
the
range
was
about
october
the
outfit
went
by
rail
northeastward
to
terry
and
from
thence
across
country
south
and
east
about
miles
around
the
head
of
creek
to
the
head
of
beaver
creek
a
tributary
of
the
little
missouri
a
good
range
was
selected
without
encroachment
upon
the
domains
of
the
hunters
already
in
the
field
and
the
camp
was
made
near
the
bank
of
the
creek
close
to
a
supply
of
wood
and
water
and
screened
from
distant
observation
by
a
circle
of
hills
and
ridges
the
two
rectangular
were
set
up
end
to
end
with
the
in
the
middle
where
the
ends
came
together
in
one
tent
the
cooking
and
eating
was
done
and
the
other
contained
the
beds
it
was
planned
that
the
various
members
of
the
party
should
cook
turn
about
a
week
at
a
time
but
one
of
them
soon
developed
such
a
rare
and
conspicuous
talent
for
and
general
cookery
that
he
was
elected
by
acclamation
to
cook
during
the
entire
season
to
the
other
three
members
fell
the
hunting
each
man
hunted
separately
from
the
others
and
skinned
all
the
animals
that
his
rifle
brought
down
there
were
buffalo
on
the
range
when
the
hunters
arrived
and
the
killing
began
at
once
at
daylight
the
sallied
forth
on
foot
carrying
in
his
hand
his
huge
sharps
rifle
weighing
from
to
pounds
with
from
to
one
hundred
loaded
cartridges
in
his
two
belts
or
his
pockets
at
his
side
depending
from
his
belt
hung
his
hunter
companion
a
flat
leather
scabbard
containing
a
ripping
knife
a
skinning
knife
and
a
butcher
steel
upon
which
to
sharpen
them
the
total
weight
carried
was
very
considerable
seldom
less
than
pounds
and
often
more
inasmuch
as
it
was
highly
important
to
move
camp
as
seldom
as
possible
in
the
course
of
a
season
work
the
hunter
exercised
the
greatest
precaution
in
killing
his
game
and
had
ever
before
his
mind
the
necessity
of
doing
his
killing
without
frightening
away
the
survivors
with
ten
thousand
buffaloes
on
their
range
it
was
considered
the
height
of
good
luck
to
find
a
bunch
of
fifty
head
in
a
secluded
draw
or
hollow
where
it
was
possible
to
make
a
kill
without
disturbing
the
big
herd
the
usually
went
on
foot
for
when
buffaloes
became
so
scarce
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
ride
his
occupation
was
practically
gone
at
the
time
i
speak
of
the
hunter
seldom
had
to
walk
more
than
miles
from
camp
to
find
buffalo
in
case
there
were
any
at
all
on
his
range
and
it
was
usually
an
advantage
to
be
without
a
horse
from
the
top
of
a
ridge
or
high
butte
the
country
was
carefully
scanned
and
if
several
small
herds
were
in
sight
the
one
easiest
to
approach
was
selected
as
the
one
to
attack
it
was
far
better
to
find
a
herd
lying
down
or
quietly
grazing
or
sheltering
from
a
cold
wind
than
to
find
it
traveling
for
while
a
hard
run
of
a
mile
or
two
often
enabled
the
hunter
to
head
off
a
moving
herd
and
kill
a
certain
number
of
animals
out
of
it
the
net
results
were
never
half
so
satisfactory
as
with
herds
absolutely
at
rest
having
decided
upon
an
attack
the
hunter
gets
to
leeward
of
his
game
and
approaches
it
according
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
if
it
is
in
a
hollow
he
secures
a
position
at
the
top
of
the
nearest
ridge
as
close
as
he
can
get
if
it
is
in
a
level
flat
he
looks
for
a
gully
up
which
he
can
skulk
until
within
good
if
there
is
no
gully
he
may
be
obliged
to
crawl
half
a
mile
on
his
hands
and
knees
often
through
snow
or
amongst
beds
of
prickly
pear
taking
advantage
of
even
such
scanty
cover
as
affords
some
montana
adopted
the
method
of
drawing
a
over
the
entire
upper
half
of
the
body
with
holes
cut
for
the
eyes
and
arms
which
simple
but
unpicturesque
arrangement
often
enabled
the
hunter
to
approach
his
game
much
more
easily
and
more
closely
than
would
otherwise
have
been
possible

the

is
always
supposed
to
be

is
the
one
to

first
the
noise
startles
the

they
stare
at
the
little
cloud
of
white
smoke
and
feel
inclined
to
run
but
seeing
their
leader
hesitate
they
wait
for
her
she
when
struck
gives
a
violent
start
forward
but
soon
stops
and
the
blood
begins
to
run
from
her
nostrils
in
two
bright
crimson
streams
in
a
couple
of
minutes
her
body
sways
unsteadily
she
staggers
tries
hard
to
keep
her
feet
but
soon
gives
a
lurch
sidewise
and
falls
some
of
the
other
members
of
the
herd
come
around
her
and
stare
and
sniff
in
wonder
and
one
of
the
more
wary
starts
to
lead
the
herd
away
but
before
she
takes
half
a
dozen
steps
bang
goes
the
hidden
rifle
again
and
her
leadership
is
ended
forever
her
fall
only
increases
the
bewilderment
of
the
survivors
over
a
proceeding
which
to
them
is
strange
and
unaccountable
because
the
danger
is
not
visible
they
cluster
around
the
fallen
ones
sniff
at
the
warm
blood
bawl
aloud
in
wonderment
and
do
everything
but
run
away
the
policy
of
the
hunter
is
to
not
fire
too
rapidly
but
to
attend
closely
to
business
and
every
time
a
buffalo
attempts
to
make
off
shoot
it
down
one
shot
per
minute
was
a
moderate
rate
of
firing
but
under
pressure
of
circumstances
two
per
minute
could
be
discharged
with
deliberate
precision
with
the
most
accurate
hunting
rifle
ever
made
a
dead
rest
and
a
large
mark
practically
motionless
it
was
no
wonder
that
nearly
every
shot
meant
a
dead
buffalo
the
vital
spot
on
a
buffalo
which
stands
with
its
side
to
the
hunter
is
about
a
foot
in
diameter
and
on
a
bull
is
considerably
more
under
such
conditions
as
the
above
which
was
called
getting
a
stand
the
hunter
nurses
his
victims
just
as
an
angler
plays
a
big
fish
with
light
tackle
and
in
the
most
methodical
manner
murders
them
one
by
one
either
until
the
last
one
falls
his
cartridges
are
all
expended
or
the
stupid
brutes
come
to
their
senses
and
run
away
occasionally
the
poor
fellow
was
troubled
by
having
his
rifle
get
too
hot
to
use
but
if
a
was
at
hand
he
would
thrust
the
weapon
into
it
without
ceremony
to
cool
it
off
a
success
in
getting
a
stand
meant
the
slaughter
of
a
herd
a
hunter
whom
i
met
in
montana
harry
andrews
told
me
that
he
once
fired
one
hundred
and
fifteen
shots
from
one
spot
and
killed
buffalo
in
less
than
an
hour
the
highest
number
mcnaney
ever
knew
of
being
killed
in
one
stand
was
head
but
colonel
dodge
once
counted
one
hundred
and
twelve
carcasses
of
buffalo
inside
of
a
semicircle
of
yards
radius
all
of
which
were
killed
by
one
man
from
the
same
spot
and
in
less
than
of
an
hour
the
kill
being
completed
the
hunter
then
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
skinning
his
victims
the
northern
hunters
were
seldom
guilty
of
the
reckless
carelessness
and
lack
of
enterprise
in
the
treatment
of
robes
which
at
one
time
was
so
prominent
a
feature
of
work
on
the
southern
range
by
the
time
white
men
began
to
hunt
for
robes
on
the
northern
range
buffalo
were
becoming
comparatively
scarce
and
robes
were
worth
from
to
each
the
had
taught
the
hunters
with
the
potent
argument
of
hard
cash
that
a
robe
carefully
and
neatly
taken
off
stretched
and
kept
reasonably
free
from
blood
and
dirt
was
worth
more
money
in
the
market
than
one
taken
off
in
a
slovenly
manner
and
contrary
to
the
nicer
demands
of
the
trade
after
buffalo
on
the
northern
range
were
skinned
with
considerable
care
and
amongst
the
not
one
was
allowed
to
become
a
loss
when
it
was
possible
to
prevent
it
every
cow
robe
was
considered
equal
to
in
hard
cash
and
treated
accordingly
the
hunter
or
skinner
always
stretched
every
robe
out
on
the
ground
to
its
fullest
extent
while
it
was
yet
warm
and
cut
the
initials
of
his
employer
in
the
thin
subcutaneous
muscle
which
always
adhered
to
the
inside
of
the
skin
a
warm
skin
is
very
elastic
and
when
stretched
upon
the
ground
the
hair
holds
it
in
shape
until
it
either
dries
or
freezes
and
so
retains
its
full
size
on
the
northern
range
skins
were
so
valuable
that
many
a
dispute
arose
between
rival
outfits
over
the
ownership
of
a
dead
buffalo
some
of
which
produced
serious
results
chase
on
horseback
or
running
buffalo
next
to
the
the
method
called
running
buffalo
was
the
most
fatal
to
the
race
and
the
one
most
universally
practiced
to
all
hunters
save
greedy
white
men
the
chase
on
horseback
yielded
spoil
sufficient
for
every
need
and
it
also
furnished
sport
of
a
superior
kind
manly
exhilarating
and
well
spiced
with
danger
even
the
horses
shared
the
excitement
and
eagerness
of
their
riders
so
long
as
the
weapons
of
the
indian
consisted
only
of
the
bow
and
arrow
and
the
spear
he
was
obliged
to
kill
at
close
quarters
or
not
at
all
and
even
when
were
first
placed
in
his
hands
their
caliber
was
so
small
the
charge
so
light
and
the
indian
himself
so
poor
a
marksman
at
long
range
that
his
best
course
was
still
to
gallop
alongside
the
herd
on
his
favorite
buffalo
horse
and
kill
at
the
shortest
possible
range
from
all
accounts
the
red
river
who
hunted
almost
exclusively
with
never
dreamed
of
the
deadly
still
hunt
but
always
killed
their
game
by
running
it
in
former
times
even
the
white
men
of
the
plains
did
the
most
of
their
buffalo
hunting
on
horseback
using
the
colt
revolver
sometimes
one
in
each
hand
until
the
made
its
appearance
which
in
a
great
measure
displaced
the
revolver
in
running
buffalo
but
about
that
time
began
the
mad
warfare
for
robes
and
hides
and
the
only
fair
and
sportsmanlike
method
of
hunting
was
declared
too
slow
for
the
greedy
then
came
the
butchery
of
the
from
that
time
on
the
buffalo
as
a
game
animal
steadily
lost
caste
it
soon
came
to
be
universally
considered
that
there
was
no
sport
in
hunting
buffalo
true
enough
of
where
the
hunter
sneaks
up
and
shoots
them
down
one
by
one
at
such
long
range
the
report
of
his
big
rifle
does
not
even
frighten
them
away
so
far
as
sportsmanlike
fairness
is
concerned
that
method
was
not
one
whit
more
elevated
than
killing
game
by
poison
bat
the
chase
on
horseback
was
a
different
thing
its
successful
prosecution
demanded
a
good
horse
a
bold
rider
a
firm
seat
and
perfect
familiarity
with
weapons
the
excitement
of
it
was
intense
the
dangers
not
to
be
despised
and
above
all
the
buffalo
had
a
fair
show
for
his
life
or
partially
so
at
least
the
mode
of
attack
is
easily
described
whenever
the
hunters
discovered
a
herd
of
buffalo
they
usually
got
to
leeward
of
it
and
quietly
rode
forward
in
a
body
or
stretched
out
in
a
regular
skirmish
line
behind
the
shelter
of
a
knoll
perhaps
until
they
had
approached
the
herd
as
closely
as
could
be
done
without
alarming
it
usually
the
unsuspecting
animals
with
a
confidence
due
more
to
their
great
numbers
than
anything
else
would
allow
a
party
of
horsemen
to
approach
within
from
to
yards
of
their
flankers
and
then
they
would
start
off
on
a
slow
trot
the
hunters
then
put
spurs
to
their
horses
and
dashed
forward
to
overtake
the
herd
as
quickly
as
possible
once
up
with
it
each
hunter
chooses
the
best
animal
within
his
reach
chases
him
until
his
flying
steed
carries
him
close
alongside
and
then
the
arrow
or
the
bullet
is
sent
into
his
vitals
the
fatal
spot
is
from
to
inches
in
circumference
and
lies
immediately
back
of
the
fore
leg
with
its
lowest
point
on
a
line
with
the
elbow
this
the
true
chase
of
the
buffalo
was
not
only
exciting
but
dangerous
it
often
happened
that
the
hunter
found
himself
surrounded
by
the
flying
herd
and
in
a
cloud
of
dust
so
that
neither
man
nor
horse
could
see
the
ground
before
them
under
such
circumstances
fatal
accidents
to
both
men
and
horses
were
numerous
it
was
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
to
shoot
each
other
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
and
while
now
and
then
a
wounded
bull
suddenly
turned
upon
his
pursuer
and
overthrew
him
the
greatest
number
of
casualties
were
from
falls
of
the
dangers
involved
in
running
buffalo
colonel
dodge
writes
as
follows
note
plains
of
the
great
west
p
the
danger
is
not
so
much
from
the
buffalo
which
rarely
makes
an
effort
to
injure
his
pursuer
as
from
the
fact
that
neither
man
nor
horse
can
see
the
ground
which
may
be
rough
and
broken
or
perforated
with
or
gopher
holes
this
danger
is
so
imminent
that
a
man
who
runs
into
a
herd
of
buffalo
may
be
said
to
take
his
life
in
his
hand
i
have
never
known
a
man
hurt
by
a
buffalo
in
such
a
chase
i
have
known
of
at
least
six
killed
and
a
very
great
many
more
or
less
injured
some
very
severely
by
their
horses
falling
with
them
on
this
point
catlin
declares
that
to
engage
in
running
buffalo
is
at
the
hazard
of
every
bone
in
one
body
to
feel
the
fine
and
thrilling
exhilaration
of
the
chase
for
a
moment
and
then
as
often
to
upbraid
and
blame
himself
for
his
folly
and
imprudence
previous
to
my
first
experience
in
running
buffalo
i
had
entertained
a
mortal
dread
of
ever
being
called
upon
to
ride
a
chase
across
a
town
the
mouth
of
a
burrow
is
amply
large
to
receive
the
hoof
of
a
horse
and
the
angle
at
which
the
hole
descends
into
the
earth
makes
it
just
right
for
the
leg
of
a
running
horse
to
plunge
into
up
to
the
knee
and
bring
down
both
horse
and
rider
instantly
the
former
with
a
broken
leg
to
say
the
least
of
it
if
the
rider
sits
loosely
and
promptly
resigns
his
seat
he
will
go
flying
forward
as
if
thrown
from
a
catapult
for
feet
or
so
perhaps
to
escape
with
a
few
broken
bones
and
perhaps
to
have
his
neck
broken
or
his
skull
fractured
on
the
hard
earth
if
he
sticks
tightly
to
his
saddle
his
horse
is
almost
certain
to
fall
upon
him
and
perhaps
kill
him
judge
then
my
feelings
when
the
first
bunch
of
buffalo
we
started
headed
straight
across
the
largest
town
i
had
ever
seen
up
to
that
time
and
not
only
was
the
ground
with
gaping
round
holes
but
it
was
also
crossed
here
and
there
by
treacherous
gullies
cut
straight
down
into
the
earth
to
an
uncertain
depth
and
so
narrow
as
to
be
invisible
until
it
was
almost
time
to
leap
across
them
but
at
such
a
time
with
the
game
thundering
along
a
few
rods
in
advance
the
hunter
thinks
of
little
else
except
getting
up
to
it
he
looks
as
far
ahead
as
possible
and
helps
his
horse
to
avoid
dangers
but
to
a
great
extent
the
horse
must
guide
himself
the

a
most
graphic
description
of
a
hunting
accident
which
may
fairly
be
quoted
in
full
as
a
type
of
many
such
i
must
say
that

fully
sympathize
with
chardon
in
his
estimate
of
the
hardness
of
the
ground
he
fell
upon
for
i
have
a
painful
recollection
of
a
fall
i
had
from
which
i
arose
with
the
settled
conviction
that
the
ground
in
montana
is
the
hardest
in
the
world
it
seemed
more
like
falling
upon
than
prairie

i
dashed
along
through
the
thundering
mass
as
they
swept
away
over
the
plain
scarcely
able
to
tell
whether
i
was
on

or
my
horse
hit
and
hooked
and
jostled
about

at

guns
flash
about

in
several
directions
but
i
heard
them
not
amidst
the
trampling
throng
mons
chardon
had
wounded
a
stately
bull
and
at
this
moment
was
passing
him
with
his
piece
leveled
for
another
shot
they
were
both
at
full
speed
and
i
also
within
the
reach
of
the

of
my
gun
when
the
bull
instantly
turned
receiving

horse
upon

horns
and
the

received
poor

who
made
a

leap
of
some
feet

more
over
the

almost
under

i
wheeled
my
horse
as
soon
as
possible
and
rode
back

lay

again

him
his

with

instantly

was
raising
himself

for

from

graphic
description
of
a
great
hunt
in
which
about

hundred
hunters
made
an
onslaught
upon
a
herd
affords
a
good
illustration
of
the
dangers
in
running
buffalo
note
red
river
settlement
p
on
this
occasion
the
surface
was
rocky
and
full
of
horses
and
riders
were
at
one
moment
all
sprawling
on
the
ground
one
horse
gored
by
a
bull
was
killed
on
the
spot
two
more
were
disabled
by
the
fall
one
rider
broke
his
another
burst
his
gun
and
lost
three
of
his
fingers
by
the
accident
and
a
third
was
struck
on
the
knee
by
an
exhausted
ball
these
accidents
will
not
be
thought
overnumerous
considering
the
result
for
in
the
evening
no
less
than
thirteen
hundred
and
tongues
were
brought
into
camp
it
really
seems
as
if
the
horses
of
the
plains
entered
willfully
and
knowingly
into
the
war
on
the
doomed
herds
but
for
the
willingness
and
even
genuine
eagerness
with
which
the
buffalo
horses
of
both
white
men
and
indians
entered
into
the
chase
hunting
on
horseback
would
have
been
attended
with
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
and
the
results
would
have
been
much
less
fatal
to
the
species
according
to
all
accounts
the
horses
of
the
indians
and
were
far
better
trained
than
those
of
their
white
rivals
no
doubt
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
use
of
the
bow
which
required
the
free
use
of
both
hands
was
only
possible
when
the
horse
took
the
right
coarse
of
his
own
free
will
or
else
could
be
guided
by
the
pressure
of
the
knees
if
we
may
believe
the
historians
of
that
period
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt
them
the
buffalo
horses
of
the
indians
displayed
almost
as
much
intelligence
and
eagerness
in
the
chase
as
did
their
human
riders
indeed
in
running
buffalo
with
only
the
bow
and
arrow
nothing
but
the
willing
of
the
horse
could
have
possibly
made
this
mode
of
hunting
either
satisfactory
or
successful

the

record
he
sergeant
pryor
had
found
it
almost
impossible
with
two
men
to
drive
on
the
remaining
horses
for
as
soon
as
they
discovered
a
herd
of
buffaloes
the
loose
horses
immediately
set
off
in
pursuit
of
them
and
surrounded
the
buffalo
herd
with
almost
as
much
skill
as
their
riders
could
have
done
at
last
he
was
obliged
to
send
one
horseman
forward
and
drive
all
the
buffaloes
from
the
route
the
hon
sibley
who
once
accompanied
the
red
river
on
their
annual
hunt
relates
the
following
one
of
the
hunters
fell
from
his
saddle
and
was
unable
to
overtake
his
horse
which
continued
the
chase
as
if
he
of
himself
could
accomplish
great
things
so
much
do
these
animals
become
imbued
with
a
passion
for
this
sport
on
another
occasion

left
his
favorite
steed
at
the

enable
him
to
recruit

strength
enjoining
upon
his
wife
the
necessity
of
properly
securing
the
animal
which
was
not
done
not
relishing
the
idea
of
being
left
behind
he
started
after
us
and
soon
was
alongside
and
thus
he
continued
to
keep
pace
with
the
hunters
in
their
pursuit
of
the
buffalo
seeming
to
await
with
impatience
the
fall
of
some
of
them
to

the

ended
he
came
neighing
to

came

hunts
which
took
place
every
year
from
about
the
of
june
to
the
of

vast
numbers
of
buffalo
were
killed
and
the

was

exhausted
as
if

had
decreed
the

of

the

like

the
army
of

indians
which
annually
went
forth
from
the
red

settlement
to
make
war
on
the

was
often
far
larger
than
the
army
with
which
cortez
subdued
a
great
empire
as
early
as
it
had
become
so
great
that
it
was
necessary
to
divide
it
into
two
divisions
one
of
which
the
white
horse
plain
division
was
accustomed
to
go
west
by
the
assinniboine
river
to
the
rapids
and
from
there
in
a
southwesterly
direction
the
red
river
division
went
south
to
pembina
and
did
the
most
of
their
hunting
in
dakota
the
two
divisions

the

of
the

which
was
expected
to
take
the

for

and
wildly
making
for

when
it
is
reported
that

have
crossed

the
great
fall
hunt
was
a
regular
event
with
about
all
the
indian
tribes
living
within
striking
distance
of
the
buffalo
in
the
course
of
which
great
numbers
of
buffalo
were
killed
great
quantities
of
meat
dried
and
made
into
pemmican
and
all
the
skins
taken
were
tanned
in
various
ways
to
suit
the
many
purposes
they
were
called
upon
to
serve
francis
la
flesche
informs
me
that
during
the
presence
of
the
buffalo
in
western
nebraska
and
until
they
were
driven
south
by
the
sioux
the
fall
hunt
of
the
omahas
was
sometimes
participated
in
by
three
hundred
lodges
or
about
people
all
told
six
hundred
of
whom
were
warriors
and
each
of
whom
generally
killed
about
ten
buffaloes
the
laws
of
the
hunt
were
very
strict
and
inexorable
in
order
that
all
participants
should
have
an
equal
chance
it
was
decreed
that
any
hunter
caught
should
be
soundly
flogged
on
one
occasion
an
indian
was
discovered
in
the
act
but
not
caught
during
the
chase
which
was
made
to
capture
him
many
arrows
were
fired
at
him
by
the
police
but
being
better
mounted
than
his
pursuers
he
escaped
and
kept
clear
of
the
camp
during
the
remainder
of
the
hunt
on
another
occasion
an
omaha
guilty
of
the
same
offense
was
chased
and
in
his
effort
to
escape
his
horse
fell
with
him
in
a
coulée
and
broke
one
of
his
legs
in
spite
of
the
sad
plight
of
the
omaha
his
pursuers
came
up
and
flogged
him
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
after
the
invention
of
the
colt
revolver
and
rifles
generally
the
chase
on
horseback
speedily
became
more
fatal
to
the
bison
than
it
ever
had
been
before
with
such
weapons
it
was
possible
to
gallop
into
the
midst
of
a
flying
herd
and
during
the
course
of
a
run
of
or
miles
discharge
from
twelve
to
forty
shots
at
a
range
of
only
a
few
yards
or
even
a
few
feet
in
this
kind
of
hunting
the
heavy
navy
revolver
was
the
favorite
weapon
because
it
could
be
held
in
one
hand
and
fired
with
far
greater
precision
than
could
a
rifle
held
in
both
hands
except
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
the
use
of
the
rifle
was
limited
and
often
attended
with
risk
to
the
hunter
but
the
revolver
was
good
for
all
directions
it
could
very
often
be
used
with
deadly
effect
where
a
rifle
could
not
have
been
used
at
all
and
moreover
it
left
the
free
many
cavalrymen
and
hunters
were
able
to
use
a
revolver
with
either
hand
or
one
in
each
hand
lew
wallace
preferred
the
smith
and
wesson
in
which
he
declared
to
be
the
best
of
revolvers
then
it
was
his
marvelous
skill
in
shooting
buffaloes
with
a
rifle
from
the
back
of
a
galloping
horse
that
earned
for
the
hon
cody
the
sobriquet

hunter
on

the
galloping
of
the
horse
makes
it
easy
for
him
to
aim
at
the
heart
of
a
buffalo
and
shoot
clear
over
its
back
no
other
shooting
is
so
difficult
or
requires
such
consummate
dexterity
as
shooting
with
any
kind
of
a

especially
a
rifle
from
the
back
of
a
running
horse
let
him
who
doubts
this
statement
try
it
for
himself
and
he
will
doubt
no
more
it
was
in
the
chase
of
the
buffalo
on
horseback
armed
with
a
rifle
that
buffalo
bill
acquired
the
marvelous
dexterity
with
the
rifle
which
he
has
since
exhibited
in
the

of
the
people

i
regret
that
circumstances
have
prevented
my
obtaining
the
exact
figures
of
the
great
kill
of
buffaloes
that
cody
once
made
in
a
single
run
in
which
he
broke
all
previous
records
in
that
line
and
fairly
earned
his
title
in
he
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
kansas
pacific
railway
then
in
course
of
construction
through
western
kansas
at
a
monthly
salary
of
to
deliver
all
the
buffalo
meat
that
would
be
required
by
the
army
of
laborers
engaged
in
building
the
road
in
eighteen
mouths
he
killed
buffaloes
or
killing
in
at
first
thought
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
it
was
ever
possible
for
indians
to
build
pens
and
drive
wild
buffaloes
into
them
as
cowboys
now
corral
their
cattle
yet
such
wholesale
catches
were
of
common
occurrence
among
the
plains
crees
of
the
south
saskatchewan
country
and
the
same
general
plan
was
pursued
with
slight
modifications
by
the
indians
of
the
assinniboine
blackfeet
and
gros
ventres
and
other
tribes
of
the
northwest
like
the
keddah
operations
in
india
this
plan
was
feasible
only
in
a
partially
wooded
country
and
where
buffalo
were
so
numerous
that
their
presence
could
be
counted
upon
to
a
certainty
the
pound
was
simply
a
circular
pen
having
a
single
entrance
but
being
unable
to
construct
a
gate
of
heavy
timbers
such
as
is
made
to
drop
and
close
the
entrance
to
an
elephant
pen
the
indians
very
shrewdly
got
over
the
difficulty
by
making
the
opening
at
the
edge
of
a
perpendicular
bank
or
feet
high
easy
enough
for
a
buffalo
to
jump
down
but
impossible
for
him
to
scale
afterward
it
is
hardly
probable
that
indians
who
were
expert
enough
to
attack
and
kill
buffalo
on
foot
would
have
been
tempted
to
undertake
the
labor
that
building
a
pound
always
involved
had
it
not
been
for
the
wild
excitement
attending
captures
made
in
this
way
and
which
were
shared
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
by
warriors
women
and
children
alike
the
best
description
of
this
method
which
has
come
under
our
notice
is
that
of
professor
hind
who
witnessed
its
practice
by
the
plains
crees
on
the
headwaters
of
the
river
in
he
describes
the
pound
he
saw
as
a
fence
constructed
of
the
trunks
of
trees
laced
together
with
green
withes
and
braced
on
the
outside
by
props
inclosing
a
circular
space
about
feet
in
diameter
it
was
placed
in
a
pretty
dell
between
and
leading
from
it
in
two
diverging
rows
like
the
guiding
wings
of
an
elephant
pen
were
the
two
rows
of
bushes
which
the
indians
designate
dead
men
which
serve
to
guide
the
buffalo
into
the
pound
the
dead
men
extended
a
distance
of
miles
into
the
prairie
they
were
placed
about
feet
apart
and
the
two
rows
gradually
diverged
until
at
their
extremities
they
were
from
to
miles
apart

p
the
last
scene
of

bloody
tragedy
is
thus
set
forth
a
week
later
within
the
circular
fence
lay
tossed
in
every
conceivable
position
over
two
hundred
dead
buffalo
the
exact
number
was
from
old
bulls
to
calves
of
three
months
old
animals
of
every
age
were
huddled
together
in
all
the
forced
attitudes
of
violent
death
some
lay
on
their
backs
with
eyes
starting
from
their
heads
and
tongue
thrust
out
through
clotted
gore
others
were
impaled
on
the
horns
of
the
old
and
strong
bulls
others
again
which
had
been
tossed
were
lying
with
broken
backs
two
and
three
deep
one
little
calf
hung
suspended
on
the
horns
of
a
bull
which
had
impaled
it
in
the
wild
race
round
and
round
the
pound
the
indians
looked
upon
the
dreadful
and
sickening
sight
with
evident
delight
and
told
how
such
and
such
a
bull
or
cow
had
exhibited
feats
of
wonderful
strength
in
the
the
flesh
of
many
of
the
cows
had
been
taken
from
them
and
was
drying
in
the
sun
on
stages
near
the
tents
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
odor
was
overpowering
and
millions
of
large
blue
humming
and
buzzing
over
the
putrefying
bodies
was
not
the
least
disgusting
part
of
the
spectacle
it
is
some
satisfaction
to
know
that
when
the
first
run
was
made
ten
days
previous
the
herd
of
two
hundred
buffaloes
was
no
sooner
driven
into
the
pound
than
a
wary
old
bull
espied
a
weak
spot
in
the
fence
charged
it
at
full
speed
and
burst
through
to
freedom
and
the
prairie
followed
by
the
entire
herd
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
wholesale
method
of
destroying
buffalo
was
once
practiced
in
montana
in
his
memoir
on
the
american
bison
j
allen
states
that
as
late
as
while
journeying
through
that
territory
in
charge
of
the
yellowstone
expedition
he
several
times
met
with
the
remains
of
these
pounds
and
their
converging
fences
in
the
region
above
the
mouth
of
the
big
horn
river
thomas
simpson
states
that
in
there
were
three
camps
of
assinniboine
indians
in
the
vicinity
of
carlton
house
each
of
which
had
its
buffalo
pound
into
which
they
drove
forty
or
fifty
animals
daily
surround
during
the
last
forty
years
the
final
extermination
of
the
buffalo
has
been
confidently
predicted
by
not
only
the
observing
white
man
of
the
west
but
also
nearly
all
the
indians
and
who
formerly
depended
upon
this
animal
for
the
most
of
the
necessities
as
well
as
luxuries
of
life
they
have
seen
the
great
herds
driven
westward
farther
and
farther
until
the
plains
were
left
tenantless
and
hunger
took
the
place
of
feasting
on
the
choice
of
the
chase
and
is
it
not
singular
that
during
this
period
the
indian
tribes
were
not
moved
by
a
common
impulse
to
kill
sparingly
and
by
the
exercise
of
a
reasonable
economy
in
the
chase
to
make
the
buffalo
last
as
long
as
possible
but
apparently
no
such
thoughts
ever
entered
their
minds
so
far
as
were
concerned
they
looked
with
jealous
eyes
upon
the
white
hunter
and
considered
him
as
much
of
a
robber
as
if
they
had
a
brand
on
every
buffalo
it
has
been
claimed
by
some
authors
that
the
indians
killed
with
more
judgment
and
more
care
for
the
future
than
did
the
white
man
but
i
fail
to
find
any
evidence
that
such
was
ever
the
fact
they
all
killed
wastefully
wantonly
and
always
about
five
times
as
many
head
as
were
really
necessary
for
food
it
was
always
the
same
old
story
whenever
a
gang
of
indians
needed
meat
a
whole
herd
was
slaughtered
the
choicest
portions
of
the
finest
animals
were
taken
and
about
per
cent
of
the
whole
left
to
putrefy
and
fatten
the
wolves
and
now
as
we
read
of
the
appalling
slaughter
one
can
scarcely
repress
the
feeling
of
grim
satisfaction
that
arises
when
we
also
read
that
many
of
the
are
almost
starving
for
the
millions
of
pounds
of
fat
and
juicy
buffalo
meat
they
wasted
a
few
years
ago
verily
the
buffalo
is
in
a
great
measure
avenged
already
the
following
extract
from
catlin
north
american
indians
i
page
serves
well
to
illustrate
not
only
a
very
common
and
very
deadly
indian
method
of
wholesale
slaughter
the
surround
but
also
to
show
the
senseless
destructiveness
of
indians
even
when
in
a
state
of
which
was
brought
upon
them
by
similar
acts
of
improvidence
and
wastefulness
note
mis
pt
the
minatarees
as
well
as
the
mandans
had
suffered
for
some
months
past
for
want
of
meat
and
had
indulged
in
the
most
alarming
fears
that
the
herds
of
buffalo
were
emigrating
so
far
off
from
them
that
there
was
great
danger
of
their
actual
starvation
when
it
was
suddenly
announced
through
the
village
one
morning
at
an
early
hour
that
a
herd
of
buffaloes
was
in
sight
a
hundred
or
more
young
men
mounted
their
horses
with
weapons
in
hand
and
steered
their
course
to
the
prairies
the
plan
of
attack
which
in
this
country
is
familiarly
called
a
surround
was
explicitly
agreed
upon
and
the
hunters
who
were
all
mounted
on
their
horses
and
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
or
long
lances
divided
into
two
columns
taking
opposite
directions
and
drew
themselves
gradually
around
the
herd
at
a
mile
or
more
distance
from
them
thus
forming
a
circle
of
horsemen
at
equal
distances
apart
who
gradually
closed
in
upon
them
with
a
moderate
pace
at
a
signal
given
the
unsuspecting
herd
at
length
the
wind
of
the
approaching
enemy
and
fled
in
a
mass
in
the
greatest
confusion
to
the
point
where
they
were
aiming
to
cross
the
line
the
horsemen
were
seen
at
full
speed
gathering
and
forming
in
a
column
brandishing
their
weapons
and
yelling
in
the
most
frightful
manner
by
which
they
turned
the
black
and
rushing
mass
which
moved
off
in
an
opposite
direction
where
they
were
again
met
and
foiled
in
a
similar
manner
and
wheeled
back
in
utter
confusion
by
which
time
the
horsemen
had
closed
in
from
all
directions
forming
a
continuous
line
around
them
whilst
the
poor
affrighted
animals
were
eddying
about
in
a
crowded
and
confused
mass
hooking
and
climbing
upon
each
other
when
the
work
of
death
commenced
i
had
rode
up
in
the
rear
and
occupied
an
elevated
position
at
a
few
distance
from
which
i
could
like
the
general
of
a
battlefield
survey
from
my
horse
back
the
nature
and
the
progress
of
the
grand
but
unlike
him
without
the
power
of
issuing
a
command
or
in
any
way
directing
its
issue
in
this
grand
turmoil
see
illustration
a
cloud
of
dust
was
soon
raised
which
in
parts
obscured
the
throng
where
the
hunters
were
galloping
their
horses
around
and
driving
the
whizzing
arrows
or
their
long
lances
to
the
hearts
of
these
noble
animals
which
in
many
instances
becoming
infuriated
with
deadly
wounds
in
their
sides
erected
their
shaggy
manes
over
their
bloodshot
eyes
and
furiously
plunged
forward
at
the
sides
of
their
assailants
horses
sometimes
goring
them
to
death
at
a
lunge
and
putting
their
dismounted
riders
to
flight
for
their
lives
sometimes
their
dense
crowd
was
opened
and
the
blinded
horsemen
too
intent
on
their
prey
amidst
the
cloud
of
dust
were
hemmed
and
wedged
in
amidst
the
crowding
beasts
over
whose
backs
they
were
obliged
to
leap
for
security
leaving
their
horses
to
the
fate
that
might
await
them
in
the
results
of
this
wild
and
desperate
war
many
were
the
bulls
that
turned
upon
their
assailants
and
met
them
with
desperate
resistance
and
many
were
the
warriors
who
were
dismounted
and
saved
themselves
by
the
superior
muscles
of
their
legs
some
who
were
closely
pursued
by
the
bulls
wheeled
suddenly
around
and
snatching
the
part
of
a
buffalo
robe
from
around
their
waists
threw
it
over
the
horns
and
eyes
of
the
infuriated
beast
and
darting
by
its
side
drove
the
arrow
or
the
lance
to
its
heart
others
suddenly
dashed
off
upon
the
prairie
by
the
side
of
the
affrighted
animals
which
had
escaped
from
the
throng
and
closely
escorting
them
for
a
few
rods
brought
down
their
heart
blood
in
streams
and
their
huge
carcasses
upon
the
green
and
enameled
turf
in
this
way
this
grand
hunt
soon
resolved
itself
into
a
desperate
battle
in
the
space
of
fifteen
minutes
resulted
in
the
total
destruction
of
the
whole
which
in
all
their
strength
and
fury
were
doomed
like
every
beast
and
living
thing
else
to
fall
before
the
destroying
hands
of
mighty
man
i
had
sat
in
trembling
silence
upon
my
horse
and
witnessed
this
extraordinary
scene
which
allowed
not
one
of
these
animals
to
escape
out
of
my
sight
many
plunged
off
upon
the
prairie
for
a
distance
but
were
overtaken
and
killed
and
although
i
could
not
distinctly
estimate
the
number
that
were
slain
yet
i
am
sure
that
some
hundreds
of
these
noble
animals
fell
in
this
grand
amongst
the
poor
affrighted
creatures
that
had
occasionally
dashed
through
the
ranks
of
their
enemy
and
sought
safety
in
flight
upon
the
prairie
and
in
some
instances
had
undoubtedly
gained
it
i
saw
them
stand
awhile
looking
back
when
they
turned
and
as
if
bent
on
their
own
destruction
retraced
their
steps
and
mingled
themselves
and
their
deaths
with
those
of
the
dying
throng
others
had
fled
to
a
distance
on
the
prairies
and
for
want
of
company
of
friends
or
of
foes
had
stood
and
gazed
on
till
the
was
over
seemingly
taking
pains
to
stay
and
hold
their
lives
in
readiness
for
their
destroyers
until
the
general
destruction
was
over
when
they
fell
easy
victims
to
their
weapons
making
the
slaughter
complete
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
of
this
entire
herd
of
several
hundred
was
slain
on
the
spot
and
there
is
no
room
to
doubt
that
at
least
half
possibly
much
more
of
the
meat
thus
taken
was
allowed
to
become
a
loss
people
who
are
so
utterly
senseless
as
to
wantonly
destroy
their
own
source
of
food
as
the
indians
have
done
certainly
deserve
to
starve

the
locality
indicated
was
the
missouri
river
in
montana
just
above
the
mouth
of
judith
river
on
the
north
we
passed
a
precipice
about
feet
high
under
which
lay
scattered
the
fragments
of
at
least
one
hundred
carcasses
of
buffaloes
although
the
water
which
had
washed
away
the
lower
part
of
the
hill
must
have
carried
off
many
of
the
dead
these
buffaloes
had
been
chased
down
a
precipice
in
a
way
very
common
on
the
missouri
and
by
which
vast
herds
are
destroyed
in
a
moment
the
mode
of
hunting
is
to
select
one
of
the
most
active
and
fleet
young
men
who
is
disguised
by
a
buffalo
skin
round
his
body
the
skin
of
the
head
with
the
ears
and
horns
fastened
on
his
own
head
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
the
buffaloes
thus
dressed
he
fixes
himself
at
a
convenient
distance
between
a
herd
of
buffaloes
and
any
of
the
river
precipices
which
sometimes
extend
for
some
miles
his
companions
in
the
mean
time
get
in
the
rear
and
side
of
the
herd
and
at
a
given
signal
show
themselves
and
advance
towards
the
buffaloes
they
instantly
take
alarm
and
finding
the
hunters
beside
them
they
run
toward
the
disguised
indian
or
decoy
who
leads
them
on
at
full
speed
toward
the
river
when
suddenly
securing
himself
in
some
crevice
of
the
cliff
which
he
had
previously
fixed
on
the
herd
is
left
on
the
brink
of
the
precipice
it
is
then
in
vain
for
the
foremost
to
retreat
or
even
to
stop
they
are
pressed
on
by
the
hindmost
rank
who
seeing
no
danger
but
from
the
hunters
goad
on
those
before
them
till
the
whole
are
precipitated
and
the
shore
is
strewed
with
their
dead
bodies
sometimes
in
this
perilous
seduction
the
indian
is
himself
either
trodden
under
foot
by
the
rapid
movements
of
the
buffaloes
or
missing
his
footing
in
the
cliff
is
urged
down
the
precipice
by
the
falling
herd
the
indians
then
select
as
much
meat
as
they
wish
and
the
rest
is
abandoned
to
the
wolves
and
creates
a
most
dreadful
stench

the

from
the

of
theo
davis
in
an
article
entitled
the
buffalo

as
i
have
previously
stated
the
best
hunting
on
the
range
is
to
be
found
between
the
platte
and
arkansas
rivers
here
i
have
seen
the
indians
have
recourse
to
another
method
of
slaughtering
buffalo
in
a
very
easy
but
to
me
a
cruel
way
for
where
one
buffalo
is
killed
several
are
sure
to
be
painfully
injured
but
these
too
are
soon
killed
by
the
indians
who
make
haste
to
lance
or
shoot
the
cripples
the
mode
of
hunting
is
somewhat
as
follows
a
herd
is
discovered
grazing
on
the
being
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
country
the
indians
are
aware
of
the
location
of
the
nearest
point
where
the
table
land
is
broken
abruptly
by
a
precipice
which
descends
a
hundred
or
more
feet
toward
this
the
indians
head
the
herd
which
is
at
once
driven
pell
mell
to
and
over
the
precipice
meanwhile
a
number
of
indians
have
taken
their
way
by
means
of
routes
known
to
them
and
succeed
in
reaching
the
cañon
through
which
the
crippled
buffalo
are
running
in
all
directions
these
are
quickly
killed
so
that
out
of
a
very
considerable
band
of
buffalo
but
few
escape
many
having
been
killed
by
the
fall
and
others
dispatched
while
limping
off
this
mode
of
hunting
is
sometimes
indulged
in
by
white
men
but
it
is
done
more
for
deviltry
than
anything
else
i
have
never
known
of
its
practice
by
army
officers
or
persons
who
professed
to
hunt
buffalo
as
a
sport
on
in
the
dead
of
the
winters
says
catlin
which
are
very
long
and
severely
cold
in
this
country
where
horses
can
not
be
brought
into
the
chase
with
any
avail
the
indian
runs
upon
the
surface
of
the
snow
by
aid
of
his
which
buoy
him
up
while
the
great
weight
of
the
buffaloes
sinks
them
down
to
the
middle
of
their
sides
and
completely
stopping
their
progress
insures
them
certain
and
easy
victims
to
the
bow
or
lance
of
their
pursuers
the
snow
in
these
regions
often
lies
during
the
winter
to
the
depth
of
and
feet
being
blown
away
from
the
tops
and
sides
of
the
hills
in
many
places
which
are
left
bare
for
the
buffaloes
to
graze
upon
whilst
it
is
drifted
in
the
hollows
and
ravines
to
a
very
great
depth
and
rendered
almost
entirely
impassable
to
these
huge
animals
which
when
closely
pursued
by
their
enemies
endeavor
to
plunge
through
it
but
are
soon
wedged
in
and
almost
unable
to
move
where
they
fall
an
easy
prey
to
the
indian
who
runs
up
lightly
upon
his
and
drives
his
lance
to
their
hearts
the
skins
are
then
stripped
off
to
be
sold
to
the
fur
traders
and
the
carcasses
left
to
be
devoured
by
the
wolves
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
winter
supply
of
meat
was
procured
and
dried
in
the
summer
and
fall
months
the
flesh
of
all
buffalo
killed
in
winter
was
allowed
to
become
a
total
loss
this
is
the
season
in
which
the
greatest
number
of
these
animals
are
destroyed
for
their
robes
they
are
most
easily
killed
at
this
time
and
their

indians
on

from
a
painting
in
the
national
museum
by
george
catlin
the
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
from
all
the
country
east
of
the
mississippi
was
one
of
the
inevitable
results
of
the
advance
of
civilization
to
the
early
pioneers
who
went
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
wrestle
with
nature
for
the
necessities
of
life
this
valuable
animal
might
well
have
seemed
a
gift
direct
from
the
hand
of
providence
during
the
first
few
years
of
the
early
settler
life
in
a
new
country
the
few
domestic
animals
he
had
brought
with
him
were
far
too
valuable
to
be
killed
for
food
and
for
a
long
period
he
looked
to
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
and
the
prairie
for
his
daily
supply
of
meat
the
time
was
when
no
one
stopped
to
think
of
the
important
part
our
game
animals
played
in
the
settlement
of
this
country
and
even
now
no
one
has
attempted
to
calculate
the
lessened
degree
of
rapidity
with
which
the
star
of
empire
would
have
taken
its
westward
way
without
the
bison
deer
elk
and
antelope
the
western
states
and
territories
pay
little
heed
to
the
wanton
slaughter
of
deer
and
elk
now
going
on
in
their
forests
but
the
time
will
soon
come
when
the
grangers
will
enter
those
regions
and
find
the
absence
of
game
a
very
serious
matter
although
the
bison
was
the
first
wild
species
to
disappear
before
the
advance
of
civilization
he
served
a
good
purpose
at
a
highly
critical
period
his
huge
bulk
of
toothsome
flesh
fed
many
a
hungry
family
and
his
ample
robe
did
good
service
in
the
settler
cabin
and
sleigh
in
winter
weather
by
the
time
game
animals
had
become
scarce
domestic
herds
and
flocks
had
taken
their
place
and
hunting
became
a
pastime
instead
of
a
necessity
as
might
be
expected
from
the
time
the
bison
was
first
seen
by
white
men
he
has
always
been
a
conspicuous
prize
and
being
the
largest
of
the
land
quadrupeds
was
naturally
the
first
to
disappear
every
man
hand
has
been
against
him
while
his
disappearance
from
the
eastern
united
states
was
in
the
main
due
to
the
settler
who
killed
game
as
a
means
of
subsistence
there
were
a
few
who
made
the
killing
of
those
animals
a
regular
business
this
occurred
almost
exclusively
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
salt
springs
around
which
the
bison
congregated
in
great
numbers
and
made
their
wholesale
slaughter
of
easy
accomplishment
thomas
ashe
has
recorded
some
very
interesting
facts
and
observations
on
this
point
in
speaking
of
an
old
man
who
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
built
a
log
house
for
himself
on
the
immediate
borders
of
a
salt
spring
in
western
pennsylvania
for
the
purpose
of
killing
buffaloes
out
of
the
immense
droves
which
frequented
that
spot
ashe
says
note
travels
in
america
in
london
in
the
first
and
second
years
this
old
man
with
some
companions
killed
from
six
to
seven
hundred
of
these
noble
creatures
merely
for
the
sake
of
their
skins
which
to
them
were
worth
only
shillings
each
and
after
this
of
death
they
were
obliged
to
leave
the
place
till
the
following
season
or
till
the
wolves
bears
panthers
eagles
rooks
ravens
had
devoured
the
carcasses
and
abandoned
the
place
for
other
prey
in
the
two
following
years
the
same
persons
killed
great
numbers
out
of
the
first
droves
that
arrived
skinned
them
and
left
their
bodies
exposed
to
the
sun
and
air
but
they
soon
had
reason
to
repent
of
this
for
the
remaining
droves
as
they
came
up
in
succession
stopped
gazed
on
the
mangled
and
putrid
bodies
sorrowfully
moaned
or
furiously
lowed
aloud
and
returned
instantly
to
the
wilderness
in
an
unusual
run
without
tasting
their
favorite
spring
or
licking
the
impregnated
earth
which
was
also
once
their
most
agreeable
occupation
nor
did
they
nor
any
of
their
race
ever
revisit
the
neighborhood
the
simple
history
of
this
spring
is
that
of
every
other
in
the
settled
parts
of
this
western
world
the
carnage
of
beasts
was
everywhere
the
same
i
met
with
a
man
who
had
killed
two
thousand
buffaloes
with
his
own
hand
and
others
no
doubt
have
done
the
same
thing
in
consequence
of
such
proceedings
not
one
buffalo
is
at
this
time
to
be
found
east
of
the
mississippi
except
a
few
domesticated
by
the
curious
or
carried
through
the
country
on
a
public
show
but
fortunately
there
is
no
evidence
that
such
slaughter
as
that
described
by
ashe
was
at
all
common
and
there
is
reason
for
the
belief
that
until
within
the
last
forty
years
the
buffalo
was
sacrificed
in
ways
conducive
to
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
from
coronado
to
general
frémont
there
has
hardly
been
an
explorer
of
united
states
territory
who
has
not
had
occasion
to
bless
the
bison
and
its
great
value
to
mankind
can
hardly
be
overestimated
although
by
many
it
can
readily
be
forgotten
the
disappearance
of
the
bison
from
the
eastern
united
states
was
due
to
its
consumption
as
food
it
was
very
gradual
like
the
march
of
civilization
and
under
the
circumstances
absolutely
inevitable
in
a
country
so
thickly
peopled
as
this
region
speedily
became
the
mastodon
could
have
survived
extinction
about
as
easily
as
the
bison
except
when
the
latter
became
the
victim
of
wholesale
slaughter
there
was
little
reason
to
bemoan
his
fate
save
upon
grounds
that
may
be
regarded
purely
sentimental
he
served
a
most
excellent
purpose
in
the
development
of
the
country
even
as
late
as
the
farmers
of
eastern
kansas
were
in
the
habit
of
making
trips
every
fall
into
the
western
part
of
that
state
for
wagon
loads
of
buffalo
meat
as
a
supply
for
the
succeeding
winter
the
farmers
of
texas
nebraska
dakota
and
minnesota
also
drew
largely
upon
the
buffalo
as
long
as
the
supply
lasted
the
extirpation
of
the
bison
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
was
due
to
legitimate
hunting
for
food
and
clothing
rather
than
for
marketable
peltries
in
no
part
of
that
whole
region
was
the
species
ever
numerous
although
in
the
mountains
themselves
notably
in
colorado
within
easy
reach
of
the
great
prairies
on
the
east
vast
numbers
were
seen
by
the
early
explorers
and
pioneers
but
to
the
westward
away
from
the
mountains
they
were
very
rarely
met
with
and
their
total
destruction
in
that
region
was
a
matter
of
easy
accomplishment
according
to
j
allen
the
complete
disappearance
of
the
bison
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
took
place
between
and
b
the
period
of
systematic
slaughter
from
to
we
come
now
to
a
history
which
i
would
gladly
leave
unwritten
its
record
is
a
disgrace
to
the
american
people
in
general
and
the
territorial
state
and
general
government
in
particular
it
will
cause
succeeding
generations
to
regard
us
as
being
possessed
of
the
leading
characteristics
of
the
savage
and
the
beast
of
prey
cruelty
and
greed
we
will
be
likened
to
the
tiger
of
the
indian
jungle
who
slaughters
a
dozen
bullocks
at
once
when
he
knows
he
can
eat
only
one
in
one
respect
at
least
the
white
men
who
engaged
in
the
systematic
slaughter
of
the
bison
were
savages
just
as
much
as
the
piegan
indians
who
would
drive
a
whole
herd
over
a
precipice
to
secure
a
week
rations
of
meat
for
a
single
village
the
men
who
killed
buffaloes
for
their
tongues
and
those
who
shot
them
from
the
railway
trains
for
sport
were
murderers
in
no
way
does
civilized
man
so
quickly
revert
to
his
former
state
as
when
he
is
alone
with
the
beasts
of
the
field
give
him
a
gun
and
something
which
he
may
kill
without
getting
himself
in
trouble
and
presto
he
is
instantly
a
savage
again
finding
exquisite
delight
in
bloodshed
slaughter
and
death
if
not
for
gain
then
solely
for
the
joy
and
happiness
of
it
there
is
no
kind
of
warfare
against
game
animals
too
unfair
too
disreputable
or
too
mean
for
white
men
to
engage
in
if
they
can
only
do
so
with
safety
to
their
own
precious
carcasses
they
will
shoot

from

so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
perhaps
the
most
gigantic
task
ever
undertaken
on
this
continent
in
the
line
of
was
the
extermination
of
the
bison
in
the
great
pasture
region
by
the
probably
the
brilliant
rapidity
and
success
with
which
that
lofty
undertaking
was
accomplished
was
a
matter
of
surprise
even
to
those
who
participated
in
it
the
story
of
the
slaughter
is
by
no
means
a
long
one
the
period
of
systematic
slaughter
of
the
bison
naturally
begins
with
the
first
organized
efforts
in
that
direction
in
a
wholesale
way
although
the
species
had
been
steadily
driven
westward
for
a
hundred
years
by
the
advancing
settlements
and
had
during
all
that
time
been
hunted
for
the
meat
and
robes
it
yielded
its
extermination
did
not
begin
in
earnest
until
or
thereabouts
as
before
stated
various
persons
had
previous
to
that
time
made
buffalo
killing
a
business
in
order
to
sell
their
skins
but
such
instances
were
very
exceptional
by
that
time
the
bison
was
totally
extinct
in
all
the
region
lying
east
of
the
mississippi
river
except
a
portion
of
wisconsin
where
it
survived
until
about
in
the
first
organized
buffalo
hunting
expedition
on
a
grand
scale
was
made
from
the
red
river
settlement
manitoba
in
which
five
hundred
and
forty
carts
proceeded
to
the
range
previous
to
that
time
the
buffaloes
were
found
near
enough
to
the
settlements
around
fort
garry
that
every
settler
could
hunt
independently
but
as
the
herds
were
driven
farther
and
farther
away
it
required
an
organized
effort
and
a
long
journey
to
reach
them
the
american
fur
company

at

where
they
would
be
most

to

both
white

might
be

were

this
is
what
george
catlin
wrote
at
the
mouth
of
the
tetón
river
pyatt
county
dakota
in
concerning
this
trade
it
seems
hard
and
cruel
does
it
not
that
we
civilized
people
with
all
the
luxuries
and
comforts
of
the
world
about
us
should
be
drawing
from
the
backs
of
these
useful
animals
the
skins
for
our
luxury
leaving
their
carcasses
to
be
devoured
by
the
wolves
that
we
should
draw
from
that
country
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
thousand
of
their
robes
annually
the
greater
part
of
which
are
taken
from
animals
that
are
killed
expressly
for
the
robe
at
a
season
when
the
meat
is
not
cured
and
preserved
and
for
each
of
which
skins
the
indian
has
received
but
a
pint
of
whisky
such
is
the
fact
and
that
number
or
near
it
are
annually
destroyed
in
addition
to
the
number
that
is
necessarily
killed
for
the
subsistence
of
three
hundred
thousand
indians
who
live
chiefly
upon
them
the
author
further
declared
that
the
fur
trade
in
those
great
western
realms
was
then
limited
chiefly
to
the
purchase
of
buffalo
robes

at

for
their
annual
expedition
against

mustered
as

oxen

the
total
value
of
the
property
employed
in
this

and
the
working
time
occupied
by
it
two
months
amounted
to
the
enormous
sum

they
had
been
steadily

in

it

from

the
whole

this
was
the
first
visible

of
the
systematic

reasonably
certain
as
will
be
seen
by
figures

elsewhere
that
by
this
method

destroyed
by

as

up

were

for

of

the

all

and
materially
hastened
the
extermination
of
all
the

animals
which
were
once
so
abundant
there
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
if
the
indians
had
been
uninfluenced
by
the
white
traders
or
in
other
words
had
not
been
induced
to
take
and
prepare
a
large
number
of
robes
every
year
for
the
market
the
species
would
have
survived
very
much
longer
than
it
did
but
the
demand
quickly
proved
to
be
far
greater
than
the
supply
the
indians
of
course
found
it
necessary
to
slaughter
annually
a
great
number
of
buffaloes
for
their
own
wants
for
meat
robes
leather
teepees
etc
when
it
came
to
supplementing
this
necessary
slaughter
by
an
additional
fifty
thousand
or
more
every
year
for
marketable
robes
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
improvident
savages
soon
found
when
too
late
that
the
supply
of
buffaloes
was
not
inexhaustible
naturally
enough
they
attributed
their
disappearance
to
the
white
man
who
was
therefore
a
robber
and
a
proper
subject
for
the
apparently
it
never
occurred
to
the
minds
of
the
sioux
that
they
themselves
were
equally
to
blame
it
was
always
who
killed
the
buffaloes
and
it
was
always
buffaloes
that
they
killed
the
sioux
seemed
to
feel
that
they
held
a
chattel
mortgage
on
all
the
buffaloes
north
of
the
platte
and
it
required
more
than
one
pitched
battle
to
convince
them
otherwise
up
to
the
time
when
the
great
sioux
reservation
was
established
in
dakota
when
square
miles
of
country
or
nearly
the
whole
southwest
quarter
of
the
territory
was
set
aside
for
the
exclusive
occupancy
of
the
sioux
buffaloes
were
very
numerous
throughout
that
entire
region
east
of
the
missouri
river
which
is
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
sioux
reservation
from
bismarck
all
the
way
down
the
species
was
practically
extinct
as
early
as
but
at
the
time
when
it
became
unlawful
for
white
hunters
to
enter
the
territory
of
the
sioux
nation
there
were
tens
of
thousands
of
buffaloes
upon
it
and
their
subsequent
slaughter
is
chargeable
to
the
indians
alone
save
as
to
those
which
migrated
into
the
hunting
grounds
of
the
whites

their

by

so
difficult
to

that
the

it
contains
has
been
measurably
secure
from

but
now
it
also
must
go
the
marking
out
of
the
great
overland
trail
by
the
argonauts
of
in
their
rush
for
the
gold
fields
of
california
was
the
foreshadowing
of
the
great
breach
in
the
universal
herd
which
was
made
twenty
years
later
by
the
first
transcontinental
railway
the
pioneers
who
crossed
the
plains
in
those
days
killed
buffaloes
for
food
whenever
they
could
and
the
constant
harrying
of
those
animals
experienced
along
the
line
of
travel
soon
led
them
to
retire
from
the
proximity
of
such
continual
danger
it
was
undoubtedly
due
to
this
cause
that
the
number
seen
by
parties
who
crossed
the
plains
in
and
subsequently
was
surprisingly
small
but
fortunately
for
the
buffaloes
the
pioneers
who
would
gladly
have
halted
and
turned
aside
now
and
then
for
the
excitement
of
the
chase
were
compelled
to
hurry
on
and
accomplish
the
long
journey
while
good
weather
lasted
it
was
owing
to
this
fact
and
the
scarcity
of
good
horses
that
the
buffaloes
found
it
necessary
to
retire
only
a
few
miles
from
the
wagon
route
to
get
beyond
the
reach
of
those
who
would
have
gladly
hunted
them
allen
varner
of
indianola
illinois
has
kindly
furnished
me
with
the
following
facts
in
regard
to
the
presence
of
the
buffalo
as
observed
by
him
during
his
journey
westward
over
what
was
then
known
as
the
oregon
trail
the
old
oregon
trail
ran
from
independence
missouri
to
old
fort
laramie
through
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
thence
up
to
salt
lake
city
we
left
independence
on
may
c
and
struck
the
platte
river
at
grand
island
the
trail
had
been
traveled
but
very
little
previous
to
that
year
we
saw
no
buffaloes
whatever
until
we
reached
the
forks
of
the
platte
on
may
or
thereabouts
there
we
saw
seventeen
head
from
that
time
on
we
saw
small
bunches
now
and
then
never
more
than
forty
or
fifty
together
we
saw
no
great
herds
anywhere
and
i
should
say
we
did
not
see
over
five
hundred
head
all
told
the
most
western
point
at
which
we
saw
buffaloes
was
about
due
north
of
laramie
peak
and
it
must
have
been
about
the
of
june
we
killed
several
head
for
meat
during
our
trip
and
found
them
all
rather
thin
in
flesh
plainsmen
who
claimed
to
know
said
that
all
the
buffaloes
we
saw
had
wintered
in
that
locality
and
had
not
had
time
to
get
fat
the
annual
migration
from
the
south
had
not
yet
begun
or
rather
had
not
yet
brought
any
of
the
southern
buffaloes
that
far
north
in
a
few
years
the
tide
of
overland
travel
became
so
great
that
the
buffaloes
learned
to
keep
away
from
the
dangers
of
the
trail
and
many
a
pioneer
has
crossed
the
plains
without
ever
seeing
a
live
buffalo
division
of
the
universal
until
the
building
of
the
first
transcontinental
railway
made
it
possible
to
market
the
buffalo
product
buffalo
hunting
as
a
business
was
almost
wholly
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
even
then
the
slaughter
so
far
exceeded
the
natural
increase
that
the
narrowing
limits
of
the
buffalo
range
was
watched
with
anxiety
and
the
ultimate
extinction
of
the
species
confidently
predicted
even
without
railroads
the
extermination
of
the
race
would
have
taken
place
eventually
but
it
would
have
been
delayed
perhaps
twenty
years
with
a
recklessness
of
the
future
that
was
not
to
be
expected
of
savages
though
perhaps
perfectly
natural
to
civilized
white
men
who
place
the
possession
of
a
dollar
above
everything
else
the
indians
with
one
accord
singled
out
the
for
slaughter
because
their
robes
and
their
flesh
better
suited
the
fastidious
taste
of
the
noble
redskin

of

at
omaha

during

thence
onward

only
one

solitary

bull
wandering
aimlessly
along

the

divided
forever
the
buffaloes
of
the
united
states
into
two
great
herds
which
thereafter
became
known
respectively
as
the
northern
and
southern
herds
both
retired
rapidly
and
permanently
from
the
railway
and
left
a
strip
of
country
over
miles
wide
almost
uninhabited
by
them
although
many
thousand
buffaloes
were
killed
by
hunters
who
made

who

miles
of

of
thousands
went

hundreds
of
thousands
remained

the
chosen
home
of
the
buffalo

the
range
of
the
northern
herd
covered
about
twice
as
much
territory
as
did
the
southern
the
latter
contained
probably
twice
as
many
buffaloes
the
number
of
individuals
in
the
southern

in
the
year
must
have
been
at

three

and
as
soon
as
the
railways
crossed
the
buffalo
country
the
slaughter
began
the
rush
to
the

only
surpassed
by
the
rush
to
the
gold

in
earlier
years
the
railroad
builders
teamsters
professional
hunters
trappers
guides
and
every
one
out
of
a
job
turned
out
to
hunt
buffalo
for
hides
and
meat
the
merchants
who
had
already
settled
in
all
the
little
towns
along
the
three
great
railways
saw
an
opportunity
to
make
money
out
of
the
buffalo
product
and
forthwith
began
to
organize
and
supply
hunting
parties
with
arms
ammunition
and
provisions
and
send
them
to
the
range
an
immense
business
of
this
kind
was
done
by
the
merchants
of
dodge
city
fort
dodge
wichita
and
leavenworth
and
scores
of
smaller
towns
did
a
corresponding
amount
of
business
in
the
same
line
during
the
years
to
but
little
else
was
done
in
that
country
except
buffalo
killing
central
depots
were
established
in
the
best
buffalo
country
from
whence
hunting
parties
operated
in
all
directions
buildings
were
erected
for
the
curing
of
meat
and
corrals
were
built
in
which
to
heap
up
the
immense
piles
of
buffalo
skins
that
accumulated
at
dodge
city
as
late
as
professor
thompson
saw
a
lot
of
baled
buffalo
skins
in
a
corral
the
solid
cubical
contents
of
which
he
calculated
to
equal
cords
at
first
the
utmost
wastefulness
prevailed
every
one
wanted
to
kill
buffalo
and
no
one
was
willing
to
do
the
skinning
and
curing
thousands
upon
thousands
of
buffaloes
were
killed
for
their
tongues
alone
and
never
skinned
thousands
more
were
wounded
by
unskillful
marksmen
and
wandered
off
to
die
and
become
a
total
loss
but
the
climax
of
wastefulness
and
sloth
was
not
reached
until
the
enterprising
began
to
skin
his
dead
buffaloes
by
the
process
is
of
interest
as
showing
the
depth
of
degradation
to
which
a
man
can
fall
and
still
call
himself
a
hunter
the
skin
of
the
buffalo
was
ripped
open
along
the
belly
and
throat
the
legs
cut
around
at
the
knees
and
ripped
up
the
rest
of
the
way
the
skin
of
the
neck
was
divided
all
the
way
around
at
the
back
of
the
head
and
skinned
back
a
few
inches
to
afford
a
start
a
stout
iron
bar
like
a
hitching
post
was
then
driven
through
the
skull
and
about
inches
into
the
earth
after
which
a
rope
was
tied
very
firmly
to
the
thick
skin
of
the
neck
made
ready
for
that
purpose
the
other
end
of
this
rope
was
then
hitched
to
the
whiffletree
of
a
pair
of
horses
or
to
the
rear
axle
of
a
wagon
the
horses
were
whipped
up
and
the
skin
was
forthwith
either
torn
in
two
or
torn
off
the
buffalo
with
about
pounds
of
flesh
adhering
to
it
it
soon
became
apparent
to
even
the
most
enterprising
buffalo
skinner
that
this
method
was
not
an
unqualified
success
and
it
was
presently
abandoned
the
slaughter
which
began
in
was
prosecuted
with
great
vigor
and
enterprise
in
and
reached
its
heighten
by
that
time
the
buffalo
country
fairly
swarmed
with
hunters
each
party
putting
forth
its
utmost
efforts
to
destroy
more
buffaloes
than
its
rivals
by
that
time
experience
had
taught
the
value
of
thorough
organization
and
the
butchering
was
done
in
a
more
way
by
a
coincidence
that
proved
fatal
to
the
bison
it
was
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
slaughter
that
rifles
attained
what
was
practically
perfection
the
sharps
or
and
the
remington
were
the
favorite
weapons
of
the
the
former
being
the
one
in
most
general
use
before
the
leaden
hail
of
thousands
of
these
deadly
the
buffaloes
went
down
at
the
rate
of
several
thousand
daily
during
the
hunting
season
during
the
years
and
the
most
wanton
wastefulness
prevailed
colonel
dodge
declares
that
though
hundreds
of
thousands
of
skins
were
sent
to
market
they
scarcely
indicated
the
extent
of
the
slaughter
through
want
of
skill
in
shooting
and
want
of
knowledge
in
preserving
the
hides
of
those
slain
by
green
hunters
hide
sent
to
market
represented
three
four
or
even
five
dead
the
skinners
and
curers
knew
so
little
of
the
proper
mode
of
curing
hides
that
at
least
half
of
those
actually
taken
were
lost
in
the
summer
and
fall
of
one
hide
sent
to
market
represented
at
least
dead
buffalo
this
condition
of
affairs
rapidly
improved
but
such
was
the
furor
for
slaughter
and
the
ignorance
of
all
concerned
that
every
hide
sent
to
market
in
represented
no
less
than
dead
buffalo
by
the
condition
of
affairs
had
somewhat
improved
through
better
organization
of
the
hunting
parties
and
knowledge
gained
by
experience
in
curing
for
all
that
however
buffaloes
were
still
so
exceedingly
plentiful
and
shooting
was
so
much
easier
than
skinning
the
latter
was
looked
upon
as
a
necessary
evil
and
still
slighted
to
such
an
extent
that
every
hide
actually
sold
and
delivered
represented
two
dead
buffaloes
in
the
slaughterers
began
to
take
alarm
at
the
increasing
scarcity
of
buffalo
and
the
skinners
having
a
much
smaller
number
of
dead
animals
to
take
care
of
than
ever
before
were
able
to
devote
more
time
to
each
subject
and
do
their
work
properly
as
a
result
colonel
dodge
estimated
that
during
and
from
that
time
on
one
hundred
skins
delivered
represented
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
dead
buffaloes
but
that
no
parties
have
ever
got
the
proportion

that
in
places
favorable
to
such
warfare
as
the

a
herd
of
buffalo
has
by
shooting
at
it
by
day
and
by
lighting
fires
and
firing
guns
at
night
been
kept
from
water
until
it
has
been
entirely
destroyed
in
the
autumn
of
when
william
blackmore
traveled
for
some
or
miles
along
the
north
bank
of
the
arkansas
river

the
east
of

was
a
continuous
line
of
putrescent
carcasses

that
the

was
rendered
pestilential
and
offensive
to
the
last
degree
the
hunters
had
formed
a
line
of
camps
along
the
banks
of
the
river
and
had
shot
down
the
buffalo
night
and
morning
as
they
came
to
drink
in
order
to
give
an
idea
of
the
number
of
these
carcasses
it
is
only
necessary
to
mention
that
i
counted
on
one
spot
not
covering
acres
white
hunters
were
not
allowed
to
hunt
in
the
indian
territory
but
the
southern
boundary
of
the
state
of
kansas
was
picketed
by
them
and
a
herd
no
sooner
crossed
the
line
going
north
than
it
was
destroyed
every
was
guarded
by
a
camp
of
hunters
and
whenever
a
thirsty
herd
approached
it
was
promptly
met
by
during
this
entire
period
the
slaughter
of
buffaloes
was
universal
the
man
who
desired
buffalo
meat
for
food
almost
invariably
killed
five
times
as
many
animals
as
he
could
utilize
and
after
cutting
from
each
victim
its
very
choicest
parts
the
possibly
or
perhaps
the
hump
and
hind
quarters
one
or
the
other
or
both
fully
of
the
really
edible
portion
of
the
carcass
would
be
left
to
the
wolves
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
man
to
bring
in
two
barrels
of
salted
buffalo
tongues
without
another
pound
of
meat
or
a
solitary
robe
the
tongues
were
purchased
at
cents
each
and
sold
in
the
markets
farther
east
at
cents
in
those
days
of
criminal
wastefulness
it
was
a
very
common
thing
for
buffaloes
to
be
slaughtered
for
their
tongues
alone
george
catlin
relates
that
a
few
days
previous
to
his
arrival
at
the
mouth
of
the
tetón
river
dakota
in
an
immense
herd
of
buffaloes
had
showed
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
whereupon
a
party
of
five
or
six
hundred
sioux
indians
on
horseback
forded
the
river
attacked
the
herd
recrossed
the
river
about
sunset
and
came
into
the
fort
with
fourteen
hundred
fresh
buffalo
tongues
which
were
thrown
down
in
a
mass
and
for
which
they
required
only
a
few
gallons
of
whisky
which
was
soon
consumed
in
a
little
harmless
carouse
catlin
states
that
from
all
that
he
could
learn
not
a
skin
or
a
pound
of
meat
other
than
the
tongues
was
saved
after
this
awful
slaughter
note
north
american
indians
i
judging
from
all
accounts
it
is
making
a
safe
estimate
to
say
that
probably
no
fewer
than
fifty
thousand
buffaloes
have
been
killed
for
their
tongues
alone
and
the
most
of
these
are
undoubtedly
chargeable
against
white
men
who
ought
to
have
known
better
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
slaughter
of
buffaloes
by
foreign
sportsmen
particularly
englishmen
but
i
must
say
that
from
all
that
can
be
ascertained
on
this
point
this
element
of
destruction
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
and
overestimated
it
is
true
that
every
english
sportsman
who
visited
this
country
in
the
days
of
the
buffalo
always
resolved
to
have
and
did
have
a
buffalo
hunt
and
usually
under
the
auspices
of
united
states
army
officers
undoubtedly
these
parties
did
kill
hundreds
of
buffaloes
but
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
the
aggregate
of
the
number
slain
by
foreign
sportsmen
would
run
up
higher
than
ten
thousand
indeed
for
myself
i
am
well
convinced
that
there
are
many
old
yet
living
each
of
whom
is
accountable
for
a
greater
number
of
victims
than
all
buffaloes
killed
by
foreign
sportsmen
would
make
added
together
the
professional
butchers
were
very
much
given
to
crying
out
against
them
english
lords
and
holding
up
their
hands
in
holy
horror
at
buffaloes
killed
by
them
for
their
heads
instead
of
for
hides
to
sell
at
a
dollar
apiece
but
it
is
due
the
american
public
to
say
that
all
this
outcry
was
received
at
its
true
value
and
deceived
very
few
by
those
in
possession
of
the
facts
it
was
recognized
as
a
blind
to
divert
public
opinion
from
the
real
culprits
nevertheless
it
is
very
true
that
many
men
who
were
properly
classed
as
sportsmen
in
contradistinction
from
the
did
engage
in
useless
and
inexcusable
slaughter
to
an
extent
that
was
highly
reprehensible
to
say
the
least
a
sportsman
is
not
supposed
to
kill
game
wantonly
when
it
can
be
of
no
possible
use
to
himself
or
any
one
else
but
a
great
many
do
it
for
all
that
indeed
the
sportsman
who
kills
sparingly
and
conscientiously
is
rather
the
exception
than
the
rule
colonel
dodge
thus
refers
to
the
work
of
some
foreign
sportsmen
in
the
fall
of
that
year
three
english
gentlemen
went
out
with
me
for
a
short
hunt
and
in
their
excitement
bagged
more
buffalo
than
would
have
supplied
a
brigade
as
a
general
thing
however
the
professional
sportsmen
who
went
out
to
have
a
buffalo
hunt
for
the
excitement
of
the
chase
and
the
trophies
it
yielded
nearly
always
found
the
bison
so
easy
a
victim
and
one
whose
capture
brought
so
little
glory
to
the
hunter
that
the
chase
was
voted
very
disappointing
and
soon
abandoned
in
favor
of
nobler
game
in
those
days
there
was
no
more
to
boast
of
in
killing
a
buffalo
than
in
the
assassination
of
a
texas
steer
it
was
then
the
white
and
red
but
especially
white
who
wiped
out
the
great
southern
herd
in
four
short
years
the
prices
received
for
hides
varied
considerably
according
to
circumstances
but
for
the
green
or
undressed
article
it
usually
ranged
from
cents
for
the
skins
of
calves
to
for
those
of
adult
animals
in
good
condition
such
prices
seem
ridiculously
small
but
when
it
is
remembered
that
when
buffaloes
were
plentiful
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
hunter
to
kill
from
forty
to
sixty
head
in
a
day
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
the
of
making
very
handsome
profits
were
sufficient
to
tempt
hunters
to
make
extraordinary
exertions
moreover
even
when
the
buffaloes
were
nearly
gone
the
country
was
overrun
with
men
who
had
absolutely
nothing
else
to
look
to
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
so
no
matter
whether
the
profits
were
great
or
small
so
long
as
enough
buffaloes
remained
to
make
it
possible
to
get
a
living
by
their
pursuit
they
were
hunted
down
with
the
most
determined
persistency
and
pertinacity

the
the
most
careful
and
reliable
estimate
ever
made

carried

pounds
pounds
the
officials
of
the
kansas
pacific
and
union
pacific
railroads
either
could
not
or
would
not
furnish
any
statistics
of
the
amount
of
the
buffalo
product
carried
by
their
lines
during
this
period
and
it
became
necessary
to
proceed
without
the
actual
figures
in
both
cases
inasmuch
as
the
kansas
pacific
road
cuts
through
a
portion
of
the
buffalo
country
which
was
in
every
respect
as
thickly
inhabited
by
those
animals
as
the
region
traversed
by
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
it
seemed
absolutely
certain
that
the
former
road
hauled
out
fully
as
many
hides
as
the
latter
if
not
more
and
its
quota
is
so
set
down
the
union
pacific
line
handled
a
much
smaller
number
of
buffalo
hides
than
either
of
its
southern
rivals
but
colonel
dodge
believes
that
this
with
the
smaller
roads
which
touch
the
buffalo
region
taken
together
carried
about
as
much
as
either
of
the
two
principal
buffalo
roads
colonel
dodge
considers
it
reasonably
certain
that
the
statistics
furnished
by
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
road
represent
only
of
the
entire
buffalo
product
and
there
certainly
appears
to
be
good
ground
for
this
belief
it
is
therefore
in
order
to
base
further
calculations
upon
these
figures
according
to
evidence
gathered
on
the
spot
by
colonel
dodge
during
the
period
of
the
great
slaughter
one
hide
sent
to
market
in
represented
three
dead
buffaloes
in
two
and
in
one
hundred
skins
delivered
represented
one
hundred
and
dead
animals
the
total
slaughter
by
white
men
was
therefore
about
as
below
of
other
whites
estimated
during
all
this
time
the
indians
of
all
tribes
within
striking
distance
of
the
herds
killed
an
immense
number
of
buffaloes
every
year
in
the
summer
they
killed
for
the
hairless
hides
to
use
for
lodges
and
for
leather
and
in
the
autumn
they
slaughtered
for
robes
and
meat
but
particularly
robes
which
were
all
they
could
offer
the
white
trader
in
exchange
for
his
goods
they
were
too
lazy
and
shiftless
to
cure
much
buffalo
meat
and
besides
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
fed
them
in
regard
to
the
number
of
buffaloes
of
the
southern
herd
killed
by
the
indians
colonel
dodge
arrives
at
an
estimate
as
follows
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
estimate
the
number
of
dead
buffalo
represented
by
the
skins
or
robes
sent
to
market
this
number
varies
with
the
different
tribes
and
their
greater
or
less
contact
with
the
whites
thus
the
cheyennes
arapahoes
and
kiowas
of
the
southern
plains
having
less
contact
with
whites
use
skins
for
their
lodges
clothing
bedding
saddles
lariats
for
almost
everything
the
number
of
robes
sent
to
market
represent
only
what
we
may
call
the
foreign
exchange
of
these
tribes
and
is
really
not
more
than
of
the
skins
taken
to
be
well
within
bounds
i
will
assume
that
one
robe
sent
to
market
by
these
indians
represents
six
dead
buffaloes
those
bands
of
sioux
who
live
at
the
agencies
and
whose
peltries
are
taken
to
market
by
the
union
pacific
railroad
live
in
lodges
of
cotton
cloth
furnished
by
the
indian
bureau
they
use
much
civilized
clothing
bedding
boxes
ropes
etc
for
these
luxuries
they
must
pay
in
robes
and
as
the
buffalo
range
is
far
from
wide
and
their
yearly
small
more
than
half
of
it
goes
to
market
leaving
out
of
the
account
at
this
point
all
consideration
of
the
killing
done
north
of
the
union

are
as

slaughtered
per

for
the
three
years
reference
has
already
been
made
to
the
fact
that
during
those
years
an
immense
number
of
buffaloes
were
killed
by
the
farmers
of
eastern
kansas
and
nebraska
for
their
meat
william
mitchell
of
wabaunsee
kansas
stated
to
the
writer
that
in
those
days
when
buffaloes
were
plentiful
in
western
kansas
pretty
much
everybody
made
a
trip
west
in
the
fall
and
brought
back
a
load
of
buffalo
meat
everybody
had
it
in
abundance
as
long
as
buffaloes
remained
in
any
considerable
number
very
few
skins
were
saved
in
fact
hardly
any
for
the
reason
that
nobody
knew
how
to
tan
them
and
they
always
spoiled
at
first
a
great
many
farmers
tried
to
dress
the
green
hides
that
they
brought
back
but
they
could
not
succeed
and
finally
gave
up
trying
of
course
a
great
deal
of
the
meat
killed
was
wasted
for
only
the
best
parts
were
brought
back
the
wichita
kansas
of
february
contains
the
following
reference
in
and
the
buffalo
ranged
within
miles
of
wichita
and
could
be
counted
by
the
thousands
the
town
then
in
its
infancy
was
the
headquarters
for
a
vast
number
of
who
plied
their
occupation
vigorously
during
the
winter
the
buffalo
were
killed
principally
for
their
hides
and
daily
wagon
trains
arrived
in
town
loaded
with
them
meat
was
very
cheap
in
those
days
fine
tender
buffalo
steak
selling
from
to
cents
per
pound
the
business
was
quite
profitable
for
a
time
but
a
sudden
drop
in
the
price
of
hides
brought
them
down
as
low
as
and
cents
each
it
was
a
very
common
thing
in
those
days
for
people
living
in
wichita
to
start
out
in
the
morning
and
return
by
evening
with
a
wagon
load
of
buffalo
meat
unquestionably
a
great
many
thousand
buffaloes
were
killed
annually
by
the
settlers
of
kansas
nebraska
texas
new
mexico
and
colorado
and
the
mountain
indians
living
west
of
the
great
range
the
number
so
slain
can
only
be
guessed
at
for
there
is
absolutely
no
data
on
which
to
found
an
estimate
judging
merely
from
the
number
of
people
within
reach
of
the
range
it
may
safely
be
estimated
that
the
total
number
of
buffaloes
slaughtered
annually
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
this
heterogeneous
element
could
not
have
been
less
than
fifty
thousand
and
probably
was
a
much
higher
number
this
for
the
three
years
would
make
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
the
grand
total
would
therefore
be
about
as
follows
slaughter
of
the
southern
by
professional
white
hunters
in
and
by
indians
same
period
by
settlers
and
mountain
indians
total
slaughter
in
three
years
these
figures
seem
incredible
but
unfortunately
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
for
believing
they
are
too
high
there
are
many
men
now
living
who
declare
that
during
the
great
slaughter
they
each
killed
from
hundred
to
three
thousand
buffaloes
every
year
with
thousands
of
hunters
on
the
range
and
such
possibilities
of
slaughter
before
each
it
is
after
all
no
wonder
that
an
average
of
nearly
a
million
and
a
quarter
of
buffaloes
fell
each
year
during
that
bloody
period
by
the
close
of
the
hunting
season
of
the
great
southern
herd
had
ceased
to
exist
as
a
body
it
had
been
utterly
annihilated
the
main
body
of
the
survivors
numbering
about
ten
thousand
head
fled
southwest
and
dispersed
through
that
great
tract
of
wild
desolate
and
inhospitable
country
stretching
southward
from
the
cimarron
country
across
the
public
land
strip
the
of
texas
and
the
llano
estacado
or
staked
plain
to
the
pecos
river
a
few
small
bands
of
stragglers
maintained
a
precarious
existence
for
a
few
years
longer
on
the
headwaters
of
the
republican
river
and
in
southwestern
nebraska
near
ogalalla
where
calves
were
caught
alive
as
late
as
wild
buffaloes
were
seen
in
southwestern
kansas
for
the
last
time
in
and
the
two
or
three
score
of
individuals
still
living
in
the
canadian
river
country
of
the
texas
are
the
last
wild
survivors
of
the
great
southern
herd
the
main
body
of
the
fugitives
which
survived
the
great
slaughter
of
continued
to
attract
hunters
who
were
very
hard
up
who
pursued
them
often
at
the
risk
of
their
own
lives
even
into
the
terrible
llano
estacado
in
montana
in
i
met
on
a
cattle
ranch
an
from
texas
named
harry
andrews
who
from
to
continued
in
pursuit
of
the
scattered
remnants
of
the
great
southern
herd
through
the
of
texas
and
on
into
the
staked
plain
itself
by
that
time
the
market
had
become
completely
overstocked
with
robes
and
the
prices
received
by
andrews
and
other
hunters
was
only
cents
each
for
cow
robes
and
each
for
bull
robes
delivered
on
the
range
the
purchaser
providing
for
their
transportation
to
the
railway
but
even
at
those
prices
which
were
so
low
as
to
make
buffalo
killing
seem
like
downright
murder
andrews
assured
me
that
he
made
big
money
on
one
occasion
when
he
got
a
stand
on
a
large
bunch
of
buffalo
he
fired
one
hundred
and
fifteen
shots
from
one
spot
and
killed
buffaloes
in
about
an
hour
in
buffalo
hunting
as
a
business
ceased
forever
in
the
southwest
and
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
but
one
successful
hunt
for
robes
has
been
made
in
that
region
since
that
time
that
occurred
in
the
fall
and
winter
of
about
miles
north
of
tascosa
texas
when
two
parties
one
of
which
was
under
the
leadership
of
lee
howard
attacked
the
only
band
of
buffaloes
left
alive
in
the
southwest
and
which
at
that
time
numbered
about
two
hundred
head
the
two
parties
killed
buffaloes
of
which
ten
skins
were
preserved
entire
for
mounting
of
the
remaining
the
heads
were
cut
off
and
preserved
for
mounting
and
the
skins
were
prepared
as
robes
the
mountable
skins
were
finally
sold
at
the
following
prices
young
cows
to
adult
cows
to
adult
bull
the
unmounted
heads
sold
as
follows
young
bulls
to
adult
bulls
young
cows
to
adult
cows
to
a
few
of
the
choicest
robes
sold
at
each
and
the
remainder
a
lot
of
twenty
eight
of
prime
quality
and
in
excellent
condition
were
purchased
by
the
hudson
bay
fur
company
for
such
was
the
end
of
the
great
southern
herd
in
it
contained
certainly
no
fewer
than
three
million
buffaloes
and
by
the
beginning
of
its
existence
as
a
herd
had
utterly
ceased
and
nothing
but
scattered
fugitive
bands
remained
destruction
of
the
northern
until
the
building
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
there
were
but
two
noteworthy
outlets
for
the
buffalo
robes
that
were
taken
annually
in
the
northwestern
territories
of
the
united
states
the
principal
one
was
the
missouri
river
and
the
yellowstone
river
was
the
other
down
these
streams
the
hides
were
transported
by
to
the
nearest
railway
shipping
point
for
fifty
years
prior
to
the
building
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
in
the
number
of
robes
marketed
every
year
by
way
of
these
streams
was
estimated
variously
at
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
thousand
a
great
number
of
hides
taken
in
the
british
possessions
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
found
a
market
in
canada
in
may
the
sioux
city
iowa
contained
the
following
information
in
regard
to
the
buffalo
robe
crop
of
the
previous
hunting
season
the
winter
of
it
is
estimated
by
competent
authorities
that
one
hundred
thousand
buffalo
hides
will
be
shipped
out
of
the
yellowstone
country
this
season
two
firms
alone
are
negotiating
for
the
transportation
of
thousand
hides
each
most
of
our
citizens
saw
the
big
load
of
buffalo
hides
that
the
brought
down
last
season
a
load
that
hid
everything
about
the
boat
below
the
roof
of
the
hurricane
deck
there
were
ten
thousand
hides
in
that
load
and
they
were
all
brought
out
of
the
yellowstone
on
one
trip
and
transferred
to
the
how
such
a
load
could
have
been
piled
on
the
little
not
even
the
men
on
the
boat
appear
to
know
it
hid
every
part
of
the
boat
barring
only
the
and
but
such
a
load
will
not
be
attempted
again
for
such
boats
as
ply
the
yellowstone
there
are
at
least
fifteen
full
loads
of
buffalo
hides
and
other
pelts
reckoning
one
thousand
hides
to
three
car
loads
and
adding
to
this
fifty
cars
for
the
other
pelts
it
will
take
at
least
three
hundred
and
fifty
to
carry
this
stupendous
bulk
of
peltry
east
to
market
these
figures
are
not
guesses
but
estimates
made
by
men
whose
business
it
is
to
know
about
the
amount
of
hides
and
furs
awaiting
shipment
nothing
like
it
has
ever
been
known
in
the
history
of
the
fur
trade
last
season
the
output
of
buffalo
hides
was
above
the
average
and
last
year
only
about
thirty
thousand
hides
came
out
of
the
yellowstone
country
or
less
than
a
third
of
what
is
there
now
awaiting
shipment
the
past
severe
winter
caused
the
buffalo
to
bunch
themselves
in
a
few
valleys
where
there
was
pasturage
and
there
the
slaughter
went
on
all
winter
there
was
no
sport
about
it
simply
shooting
down
the
animals
as
cattle
might
be
shot
down
in
a
to
the
credit
of
the
indians
it
can
be
said
that
they
killed
no
more
than
they
could
save
the
meat
from
the
greater
part
of
the
slaughter
was
done
by
white
hunters
or
butchers
rather
who
followed
the
business
of
killing
and
skinning
buffalo
by
the
mouth
leaving
the
carcasses
to
rot
at
the
time
of
the
great
division
made
by
the
union
pacific
railway
the
northern
body
of
buffalo
extended
from
the
valley
of
the
platte
river
northward
to
the
southern
shore
of
great
slave
lake
eastward
almost
to
minnesota
and
westward
to
an
elevation
of
feet
in
the
rocky
mountains
the
herds
were
most
numerous
along
the
central
portion
of
this
region
see
map
and
from
the
platte
valley
to
great
slave
lake
the
range
was
continuous
the
buffalo
population
of
the
southern
half
of
this
great
range
was
according
to
all
accounts
nearly
three
times
as
great
as
that
of
the
northern
half
at
that
time
or
let
us
say
there
were
about
four
million
buffaloes
south
of
the
platte
river
and
probably
about
one
million
and
a
half
north
of
it
i
am
aware
that
the
estimate
of
the
number
of
buffaloes
in
the
great
northern
herd
is
usually
much
higher
than
this
but
i
can
see
no
good
grounds
for
making
it
so
to
my
mind
the
evidence
is
conclusive
that
although
the
northern
herd
ranged
over
such
an
immense
area
it
was
numerically
less
than
half
the
size
of
the
overwhelming
multitude
which
actually
crowded
the
southern
range
and
at
times
so
completely
consumed
the
herbage
of
the
plains
that
detachments
of
the
united
states
army
found
it
difficult
to
find
sufficient
grass
for
their
mules
and
horses
note
as
an
instance
of
this
see
and
vol
ii
horace
jones
the
interpreter
here
fort
sill
says
that
on
his
first
trip
along
the
line
of
the
one
hundredth
meridian
in
accompanying
major
thomas
since
our
noble
old
general
they
passed
continuous
herds
for
over
miles
which
left
so
little
grass
behind
them
that
major
thomas
was
seriously
troubled
about
his
horses
the
various
influences
which
ultimately
led
to
the
complete
blotting
out
of
the
great
northern
herd
were
exerted
about
as
follows
in
the
british
possessions
where
the
country
was
immense
and
game
of
all
kinds
except
buffalo
very
scarce
indeed
where
in
the
language
of
professor
kenaston
the
explorer
there
was
a
great
deal
of
country
around
every
wild
animal
the
buffalo
constituted
the
main
dependence
of
the
indians
who
would
not
cultivate
the
soil
at
all
and
of
the
who
would
not
so
long
as
they
could
find
buffalo
under
such
circumstances
the
buffaloes
of
the
british
possessions
were
hunted
much
more
vigorously
and
persistently
than
those
of
the
united
states
where
there
was
such
an
abundant
supply
of
deer
elk
antelope
and
other
game
for
the
indians
to
feed
upon
and
a
paternal
government
to
support
them
with
annuities
besides
quite
contrary
to
the
prevailing
idea
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
there
were
great
herds
of
buffaloes
in
existence
in
the
saskatchewan
country
long
after
ours
had
all
been
destroyed
the
herds
of
british
america
had
been
almost
totally
exterminated
by
the
time
the
final
slaughter

still
remained
in

around
the
headwaters
of

between

and

saskatchewan
but
they
were
surrounded
and
attacked
from
all
sides
and
their
numbers
diminished
very
rapidly
until
all
were
killed
the
latest
information
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
in
regard
to
the
disappearance
of
this
northern
band
has
been
kindly
furnished
by
kenaston
who
in
and
also
in
made
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
country
between
winnipeg
and
fort
edmonton
for
the
canadian
pacific
railway
company
his
four
routes
between
the
two
points
named
covered
a
vast
scope
of
country
several
hundred
miles
in
width
in
at
moose
jaw
miles
southeast
of
the
elbow
of
the
south
saskatchewan
he
saw
a
party
of
cree
indians
who
had
just
arrived
from
the
northwest
with
several
carts
laden
with
fresh
buffalo
meat
at
fort
saskatchewan
on
the
north
saskatchewan
river
just
above
edmonton
he
saw
a
party
of
english
sportsmen
who
had
recently
been
hunting
on
the
battle
and
red
deer
rivers
between
edmonton
and
fort
kalgary
where
they
had
found
buffaloes
and
killed
as
many
as
they
cared
to
slaughter
in
one
afternoon
they
killed
fourteen
and
could
have
killed
more
had
they
been
more
in
professor
kenaston
found
the
fresh
trail
of
a
band
of
or
thirty
buffaloes
at
the
elbow
of
the
south
saskatchewan
excepting
in
the
above
instances
he
saw
no
further
traces
of
buffalo
nor
did
he
hear
of
the
existence
of
any
in
all
the
country
he
explored
in
he
saw
many
cree
indians
at
fort
in
a
starving
condition
and
there
was
no
pemmican
or
buffalo
meat
at
the
fort
in
however
a
little
pemmican
found
its
way
to
winnipeg
where
it
sold
at
cents
per
pound
an
exceedingly
high
price
it
had
been
made
that
year
evidently
in
the
mouth
of
april
as
he
purchased
it
in
may
for
his
journey
the
first
really
alarming
impression
made
on
our
northern
herd
was
by
the
sioux
indians
who
very
speedily
exterminated
that
portion
of
it
which
had
previously
covered
the
country
lying
between
the
north
platte
and
a
line
drawn
from
the
center
of
wyoming
to
the
center
of
dakota
all
along
the
missouri
river
from
bismarck
to
fort
benton
and
along
the
yellowstone
to
the
head
of
navigation
the
slaughter
went
bravely
on
all
the
indian
tribes
of
that
vast
region
sioux
cheyennes
crows
blackfeet
bloods
piegans
assinniboines
gros
ventres
and
shoshones
found
their
most
profitable
business
and
greatest
pleasure
next
to
scalping
white
settlers
in
hunting
the
buffalo
it
took
from
eight
to
twelve
buffalo
hides
to
make
a
covering
for
one
ordinary
teepee
and
sometimes
a
single
teepee
of
extra
size
required
from
twenty
to
hides
the
indians
of
our
northwestern
territories
marketed
about
thousand
buffalo
robes
every
year
so
long
as
the
northern
herd
was
large
enough
to
afford
the
supply
if
we
allow
that
for
every
skin
sold
to
white
traders
four
others
were
used
in
supplying
their
own
wants
which
must
be
considered
a
very
moderate
estimate
the
total
number
of
buffaloes
slaughtered
annually
by
those
tribes
must
have
been
about
three
hundred
and
thousand
the
end
which
so
many
observers
had
for
years
been
predicting
really
began
with
the
northern
herd
in
two
years
after
the
great
annihilation
which
had
taken
place
in
the
south
although
it
was
not
until
four
years
later
that
the
slaughter
became
universal
over
the
entire
range
it
is
very
clearly
indicated
in
the
figures
given
in
a
letter
from
messrs
baker
of
fort
benton
montana
to
the
writer
dated
october
which
reads
as
follows
there
were
sent
east
from
the
year
from
this
point
about
thousand
buffalo
robes
in
it
had
fallen
to
about
twenty
thousand
in
not
more
than
five
thousand
and
in
none
whatever
we
are
sorry
we
can
not
give
you
a
better
record
but
the
collection
of
hides
which
exterminated
the
buffalo
was
from
the
yellowstone
country
on
the
northern
pacific
instead
of
northern
montana
the
beginning
of
the
final
slaughter
of
our
northern
herd
may
be
dated
about
by
which
time
the
annual
robe
crop
of
the
indians
had
diminished
and
when
summer
killing
for
hairless
hides
began
on
a
large
scale
the
range
of
this
herd
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
tribes
of
indians
armed
with
rifles
and
abundantly
supplied
with
fixed
ammunition
up
to
the
year
the
indians
of
the
tribes
previously
mentioned
killed
probably
three
times
as
many
buffaloes
as
did
the
white
hunters
and
had
there
not
been
a
white
hunter
in
the
whole
northwest
the
buffalo
would
have
been
exterminated
there
just
as
surely
though
not
so
quickly
by
perhaps
ten
years
as
actually
occurred
along
the
north
from
the
missouri
river
to
the
british
line
and
from
the
reservation
in
northwestern
dakota
to
the
main
divide
of
the
rocky
mountains
a
distance
of
miles
as
the
crow
flies
the
country
was
one
continuous
indian
reservation
inhabited
by
eight
tribes
who
slaughtered
buffalo
in
season
and
out
of
season
in
winter
for
robes
and
in
summer
for
hides
and
meat
to
dry
in
the
southeast
was
the
great
body
of
sioux
and
on
the
southwest
the
crows
and
northern
cheyennes
all
engaged
in
the
same
relentless
warfare
it
would
have
required
a
body
of
armed
men
larger
than
the
whole
united
states
army
to
have
withstood
this
continuous
hostile
pressure
without
ultimate
annihilation
let
it
be
remembered
therefore
that
the
american
indian
is
as
much
responsible
for
the
extermination
of
our
northern
herd
of
bison
as
the
american
citizen
i
have
yet
to
learn
of
an
instance
wherein
an
indian
refrained
from
excessive
slaughter
of
game
through
motives
of
economy
or
care
for
the
future
or
prejudice
against
wastefulness
from
all
accounts
the
quantity
of
game
killed
by
an
indian
has
always
been
limited
by
two
conditions
only
lack
of
energy
to
kill
more
or
lack
of
more
game
to
be
killed
white
men
delight
in
the
chase
and
kill
for
the
sport
it
yields
regardless
of
the
effort
involved
indeed
to
a
genuine
sportsman
nothing
in
hunting
is
sport
which
is
not
obtained
at
the
cost
of
great
labor
an
indian
does
not
view
the
matter
in
that
light
and
when
he
has
killed
enough
to
supply
his
wants
he
stops
because
he
sees
no
reason
why
he
should
exert
himself
any
further
this
has
given
rise
to
the
statement
so
often
repeated
that
the
indian
killed
only
enough
buffaloes
to
supply
his
wants
if
an
indian
ever
attempted
or
even
showed
any
inclination
to
husband
the
resources
of
nature
in
any
way
and
restrain
wastefulness
on
part
of
it
would
be
gratifying
to
know
of
it
the
building
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
across
dakota
and
montana
hastened
the
end
that
was
fast
approaching
but
it
was
only
an
incident
in
the
annihilation
of
the
northern
herd
without
it
the
final
result
would
have
been
just
the
same
but
the
end
would
probably
not
have
been
reached
until
about
the
northern
pacific
railway
reached
bismarck
dakota
on
the
missouri
river
in
the
year
and
from
that
date
onward
received
for
transportation
eastward
all
the
buffalo
robes
and
hides
that
came
down
the
two
rivers
missouri
and
yellowstone
unfortunately
the
northern
pacific
railway
company
kept
no
separate
account
of
its
buffalo
product
business
and
is
unable
to
furnish
a
statement
of
the
number
of
hides
and
robes
it
handled
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
even
make
an
estimate
of
the
total
number
of
buffaloes
killed
on
the
northern
range
during
the
six
years
which
ended
with
the
annihilation
of
that
herd
in
regard
to
the
business
done
by
the
northern
pacific
railway
and
the
precise
points
from
whence
the
bulk
of
the
robes
were
shipped
the
following
letter
from
hannaford
traffic
manager
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
under
date
of
september
is
of
interest
your
communication
addressed
to
president
harris
has
been
referred
to
me
for
the
information
desired
i
regret
that
our
accounts
are
not
so
kept
as
to
enable
me
to
furnish
you
accurate
data
but
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
the
following
general
information
which
may
prove
of
some
value
to
you
from
the
years
and
our
line
did
not
extend
beyond
bismarck
which
was
the
extreme
easterly
shipping
point
for
buffalo
robes
and
hides
they
being
brought
down
the
missouri
river
from
the
north
for
shipment
from
that
point
in
the
years
and
there
were
handled
at
that
point
yearly
from
three
to
four
thousand
bales
of
robes
about
the
bales
containing
ten
robes
and
the
other
half
twelve
robes
each
during
these
years
practically
no
hides
were
shipped
in
the
shipment
of
hides
dry
and
untanned
commenced
and
in
and
our
line
was
extended
west
and
the
shipping
points
increased
reaching
as
far
west
as
terry
and
sully
springs
in
montana
during
these
years
and
which
practically
finished
the
shipments
of
hides
and
robes
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
you
any
just
idea
of
the
number
shipped
the
only
figures
obtainable
are
those
of
when
over
thousand
dry
and
untanned
buffalo
hides
came
down
the
river
for
shipment
from
bismarck
some
robes
were
also
shipped
from
this
point
that
year
and
a
considerable
number
of
robes
and
hides
were
shipped
from
several
other
shipping
points
note
it
is
to
be
noted
that
hairless
hides
from
buffaloes
killed
in
are
what
the
writer
refers
to
it
was
not
until
when
the
end
was
very
near
that
hunting
buffalo
in
summer
as
well
as
winter
became
a
wholesale
business
what
hunting
can
be
more
disgraceful
than
the
slaughter
of
females
and
young
when
skins
are
almost
worthless
the
number
of
pounds
of
buffalo
meat
shipped
over
our
line
has
never
cut
any
figure
the
bulk
of
the
meat
having
been
left
on
the
prairie
as
not
being
of
sufficient
value
to
pay
the
cost
of
transportation
the
names
of
the
extreme
eastern
and
western
stations
from
which
shipments
were
made
are
as
follows
in
bismarck
was
the
only
shipping
point
in
glendive
bismarck
and
beaver
creek
in
terry
and
sully
springs
montana
were
the
chief
shipping
points
and
in
the
order
named
so
far
as
numbers
and
amount
of
shipments
are
concerned
bismarck
on
the
east
and
forsyth
on
the
west
were
the
two
extremities
up
to
the
year
so
long
as
buffalo
were
killed
only
for
robes
the
bands
did
not
decrease
very
materially
but
beginning
with
that
year
when
they
were
killed
for
their
hides
as
well
a
most
indiscriminate
slaughter
commenced
and
from
that
time
on
they
disappeared
very
rapidly
up
to
the
year
there
were
two
large
bands
one
south
of
the
yellowstone
and
the
other
north
of
that
river
in
the
year
mentioned
those
south
of
the
river
were
driven
north
and
never
returned
having
joined
the
northern
band
and
become
practically
extinguished
since
there
have
of
course
been
occasional
shipments
both
of
hides
and
robes
but
in
such
small
quantities
and
so
seldom
that
they
cut
practically
no
figure
the
bulk
of
them
coming
probably
from
north
missouri
points
down
the
river
to
bismarck
in
the
northern
buffalo
range
embraced
the
following
streams
the
missouri
and
all
its
tributaries
from
port
shaw
montana
to
fort
bennett
dakota
and
the
yellowstone

all
its
tributaries

this
region
miles
city
montana
was
the
geographical
center
the
grass
was
good
over
the
whole
of
it
and
the
various
divisions
of
the
great
herd
were
continually
shifting
from
one
locality
to
another
often
making
journeys
several
hundred
miles
at
a
time
over
the
whole
of
this
vast
area
their
bleaching

scattered

the

may
even
now
ride
for
days
together
without
once
being
out
of
sight
of
buffalo
carcasses
or

the

we
might
on

on

always

omnipresent
grim
and
ghastly
skeleton
with
hairy
head
and
shriveled
nostrils

stretched
helplessly
upon
the
gray
turf

the
bones
of
the
body
bleached
white
as
chalk
the
year
witnessed
the
same
kind
of
a
stampede
for
the
northern
buffalo
range
that
occurred
just
ten
years
previously
in
the
south
at
that
time
robes
were
worth
from
two
to
three
times
as
much
as
they
ever
had
been
in
the
south
the
market
was
very
active
and
the
successful
hunter
was
sure
to
reap
a
rich
reward
as
long
as
the
buffaloes
lasted
at
that
time
the
hunters
and
estimated
that
there
were
five
hundred
thousand
buffaloes
within
a
radius
of
miles
of
miles
city
and
that
there
were
still
in
the
entire
northern
herd
not
far
from
one
million
head
the
subsequent
slaughter
proved
that
these
estimates
were
probably
not
far
from
the
truth
in
that
year
fort
custer
was
so
nearly
overwhelmed
by
a
passing
herd
that
a
detachment
of
soldiers
was
ordered
out
to
turn
the
herd
away
from
the
post
in
an
immense
herd
appeared
on
the
high
level

on
the
north
side
of
the
yellowstone
which
overlooks
miles
city
and
fort
keogh

below
a
squad
of
soldiers
from
the
fifth
infantry
was
sent
up
on
the
bluff
and
in
less
than
an
hour
had
killed
enough
buffaloes
to
load
six
teams
with
meat
in
there
were
still
about
twenty
bleaching
skeletons
lying
in
a
group
on
the
edge
of
this
plateau
at
the
point
where
the
road
from

reaches
the

all
the
rest
had
been
gathered
up
in
there
were
so
it
is
estimated
by
men
who
were
in
the
country
no
fewer
than
five
thousand
white
hunters
and
skinners

the
northern

blocking
in
the
great

of

say
at

to
the
satisfaction
of
old
hunters
which
were
the
most
famous
hunting
grounds
on
the
northern
range
lieutenant
partello
states
that
when
he
hunted
in
the
great
triangle
bounded
by
the
three
rivers
missouri
musselshell
and
yellowstone
it
contained
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
belief
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
buffaloes
unquestionably
that
region
yielded
an
immense
number
of
buffalo
robes
and
since
the
slaughter
of
of
bones
have
been
gathered
up
there
another
favorite
locality
was
the
country
lying
between
the
powder
river
and
the
little
missouri
particularly
the
valleys
of
beaver
and
creeks
thither
went
scores
of
outfits
and
hundreds
of
hunters
and
skinners
from
the
northern
pacific
railway
towns
from
miles
city
to
glendive
the
hunters
from
the
towns
between
glendive
and
bismarck
mostly
went
south
to
cedar
creek
and
the
grand
and
moreau
rivers
but
this
territory
was
also
the
hunting
ground
of
the
sioux
indians
from
the
great
reservation
farther
south
thousands
upon
thousands
of
buffaloes
were
killed
on
the
milk
and
marias
rivers
in
the
judith
basin
and
in
northern
wyoming
the
method
of
slaughter
has
already
been
fully
described
under
the
head
of
the
and
need
not
be
recapitulated
it
is
some
gratification
to
know
that
the
shocking
and
criminal
wastefulness
which
was
so
marked
a
feature
of
the
southern
butchery
was
almost
wholly
unknown
in
the
north
robes
were
worth
from
to
according
to
size
and
quality
and
were
removed
and
preserved
with
great
care
every
one
hundred
robes
marketed
represented
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
ten
dead
buffaloes
and
even
this
small
percentage
of
loss
was
due
to
the
escape
of
wounded
animals
which
afterward
died
and
were
devoured
by
the
wolves
after
the
skin
was
taken
off
the
hunter
or
skinner
stretched
it
carefully
upon
the
ground
inside
uppermost
cut
his
initials
in
the
adherent
subcutaneous
muscle
and
left
it
until
the
season
for
hauling
in
the
robes
which
was
always
done
in
the
early
spring
immediately
following
the
hunt
as
was
the
case
in
the
south
it
was
the
ability
of
a
single
hunter
to
destroy
an
entire
bunch
of
buffalo
in
a
single
day
that
completely
annihilated
the
remaining
thousands
of
the
northern
herd
before
the
people
of
the
united
states
even
learned
what
was
going
on
for
example
one
hunter
of
my
acquaintance
vic
smith
the
most
famous
hunter
in
montana
killed
one
hundred
and
seven
buffaloes
in
one
stand
in
about
one
hour
time
and
without
shifting
his
point
of
attack
this
occurred
in
the
red
water
country
about
miles
northeast
of
miles
city
in
the
winter
of
during
the
same
season
another
hunter
named
doc
aughl
killed
buffaloes
at
one
stand
and
john
edwards
killed
the
total
number
that
smith
claims
to
have
killed
that
season
is
about
five
thousand
where
buffaloes
were
at
all
plentiful
every
man
who
called
himself
a
hunter
was
expected
to
kill
between
one
and
two
thousand
during
the
hunting
season
from
november
to
february
and
when
the
buffaloes
were
to
be
found
it
was
a
comparatively
easy
thing
to
do
during
the
year
the
thousands
of
bison
that
still
remained
alive
on
the
range
indicated
above
and
also
marked
out
on
the
accompanying
map
were
distributed
over
that
entire
area
very
generally
in
february
of
that
year
a
fort
benton
correspondent
of
and
wrote
as
follows
it
is
truly
wonderful
how
many
buffalo
are
still
left
thousands
of
indians
and
hundreds
of
white
men
depend
on
them
for
a
living
at
present
nearly
all
the
buffalo
in
montana
are
between
milk
river
and
bear
paw
mountains
there
are
only
a
few
small
bands
between
the
missouri
and
the
yellowstone
there
were
plenty
of
buffalo
on
the
upper
marias
river
in
october
in
november
and
december
there
were
thousands
between
the
missouri
and
the
yellowstone
rivers
south
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
the
range
during
the
hunting
season
of
was
thus
defined
by
a
hunter
who
has
since
written
out
the
confessions
of
a
buffalo
butcher
for
and
vol
xxiv
then
october
the
western
limit
was
defined
in
a
general
way
by
powder
river
and
extending
eastward
well
toward
the
missouri
and
south
to
within
or
miles
of
the
black
hills
it
embraces
the
valleys
of
all
tributaries
to
powder
river
from
the
east
all
of
the
valleys
of
beaver
creek
creek
and
the
little
missouri
and
moreau
rivers
and
both
forks
of
the
cannon
ball
for
almost
half
their
length
this
immense
territory
lying
almost
equally
in
montana
and
dakota
had
been
occupied
during
the
winters
by
many
thousands
of
buffaloes
from
time
immemorial
and
many
of
the
cows
remained
during
the
summer
and
brought
forth
their
young
undisturbed
the
three
hunters
composing
the
party
whose
record
is
narrated
in
the
interesting
sketch
referred
to
went
out
from
miles
city
on
october
due
east
to
the
bad
lands
between
the
powder
river
and
creek
and
were
on
the
range
all
winter
they
found
comparatively
few
buffaloes
and
secured
only
two
hundred
and
robes
which
they
sold
at
an
average
price
of
each
they
saved
and
marketed
a
large
quantity
of
meat
for
which
they
obtained
cents
per
pound
they
found
the
whole
region
in
which
they
hunted
fairly
infested
with
indians
and
all
hunting
buffalo
the
hunting
season
which
began
in
october
and
ended
in
february
finished
the
annihilation
of
the
great
northern
herd
and
left
but
a
few
small
bauds
of
stragglers
numbering
only
a
very
few
thousand
individuals
all
told
a
noted
event
of
the
season
was
the
retreat
northward
across
the
yellowstone
of
the
immense
herd
mentioned
by
lieutenant
partello
as
containing
thousand
head
others
estimated
the
number
at
fifty
thousand
and
the
event
is
often
spoken
of
by
frontiersmen
who
were
in
that
region
at
the
time
many
think
that
the
whole
great
body
went
north
into
british
territory
and
that
there
is
still
a
goodly
remnant
of
it
in
some
remote
region
between
the
peace
river
and
the
saskatchewan
or
somewhere
there
which
will
yet
return
to
the
united
states
nothing
could
be
more
illusory
than
this
belief
in
the
first
place
the
herd
never
reached
the
british
line
and
if
it
had
it
would
have
been
promptly
annihilated
by
the
hungry
blackfeet
and
cree
indians
who
were
declared
to
be
in
a
condition
through
the
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
as
early
as
the
great
herd
that
went
north
was
utterly
extinguished
by
the
white
hunters
along
the
missouri
river
and
the
indians
living
north
of
it
the
only
vestige
of
it
that
remained
was
a
band
of
about
two
hundred
individuals
that
took
refuge
in
the
labyrinth
of
ravines
and
creek
bottoms
that
lie
west
of
the
musselshell
between
flat
willow
and
box
elder
creeks
and
another
band
of
about
which
settled
in
the
bad
lands
between
the
head
of
the
big
dry
and
big
porcupine
creeks
where
a
few
survivors
were
found
by
the
writer
in
south
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
a
band
of
about
three
hundred
settled
permanently
in
and
around
the
yellowstone
national
park
but
in
a
very
short
time
every
animal
outside
of
the
protected
limits
of
the
park
was
killed
and
whenever
any
of
the
park
buffaloes
strayed
beyond
the
boundary
they
too
were
promptly
killed
for
their
heads
and
hides
at
present
the
number
remaining
in
the
park
is
believed
by
captain
harris
the
superintendent
to
be
about
two
hundred
about
of
which
is
due
to
breeding
in
the
protected
territory
in
the
southeast
the
fate
of
that
portion
of
the
herd
is
well
known
the
herd
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
hunting
season
of
was
known
to
contain
about
ten
thousand
head
and
ranged
in
western
dakota
about
half
way
between
the
black
hills
and
bismarck
between
the
moreau
and
grand
rivers
was
speedily
reduced
to
about
one
thousand
head
vic
smith
who
was
in
at
the
death
says
there
were
eleven
hundred
others
say
twelve
hundred
just
at
this
juncture
october
sitting
bull
and
his
whole
band
of
nearly
one
thousand
braves
arrived
from
the
standing
sock
agency
and
in
two
days
time
slaughtered
the
entire
herd
vic
smith
and
a
host
of
white
hunters
took
part
in
the
killing
of
this
last
ten
thousand
and
he
declares
that
when
we
got
through
the
hunt
there
was
not
a
hoof
left
that
wound
up
the
buffalo
in
the
far
west
only
a
stray
bull
being
seen
here
and
there
afterwards
curiously
enough
not
even
the
buffalo
hunters
themselves
were
at
the
time
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
of
was
also
the
end
of
the
buffalo
at
least
as
an
inhabitant
of
the
plains
and
a
source
of
revenue
in
the
autumn
of
they
nearly
all
outfitted
as
usual
often
at
an
expense
of
many
hundreds
of
dollars
and
blithely
sought
the
range
that
had
up
to
that
time
been
so
prolific
in
robes
the
end
was
in
nearly
every
case
the
same
total
failure
and
bankruptcy
it
was
indeed
hard
to
believe
that
not
only
the
millions
but
also
the
thousands
had
actually
gone
and
forever
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
ascertain
definitely
the
number
of
robes
and
hides
shipped
from
the
northern
range
during
the
last
years
of
the
slaughter
and
the
only
reliable
estimate
i
have
obtained
was
made
for
me
alter
much
consideration
and
reflection
by
davis
of
minneapolis
minnesota
davis
was
for
many
years
a
buyer
of
furs
robes
and
hides
on
a
large
scale
throughout
our
northwestern
territories
and
was
actively
engaged
in
buying
up
buffalo
robes
as
long
as
there
were
any
to
buy
in
reply
to
a
letter
asking
for
statistics
he
wrote
me
as
follows
on
september
it
is
impossible
to
give
the
exact
number
of
robes
and
hides
shipped
out
of
dakota
and
montana
from
to
or
the
exact
number
of
buffalo
in
the
northern
herd
but
i
will
give
you
as
correct
an
account
as
any
one
can
in
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
half
a
million
buffaloes
within
a
radius
of
miles
of
miles
city
in
the
northern
pacific
railroad
was
built
as
far
west
as
glendive
and
miles
city
at
that
time
the
whole
country
was
a
howling
wilderness
and
indians
and
wild
buffalo
were
too
numerous
to
mention
the
first
shipment
of
buffalo
robes
killed
by
white
men
was
made
that
year
and
the
stations
on
the
northern
pacific
railroad
between
miles
city
and
mandan
sent
out
about
fifty
thousand
hides
and
robes
in
the
number
of
hides
and
robes
bought
and
shipped
was
about
two
hundred
thousand
and
in
forty
thousand
in
i
shipped
from
dickinson
dakota
territory
the
only
car
load
of
robes
that
went
east
that
year
and
it
was
the
last
shipment
ever
made
for
a
long
time
the
majority
of
the
cherished
the
fond
delusion
that
the
great
herd
had
only
gone
north
into
the
british
possessions
and
would
eventually
return
in
great
force
scores
of
rumors
of
the
finding
of
herds
floated
about
all
of
which
were
eagerly
believed
at
first
but
after
a
year
or
two
had
gone
by
without
the
appearance
of
a
single
buffalo
and
likewise
without
any
reliable
information
of
the
existence
of
a
herd
of
any
size
even
in
british
territory
the
butchers
of
the
buffalo
either
hung
up
their
old
sharps
rifles
or
sold
them
for
nothing
to
the
and
sought
other
means
of
livelihood
some
took
to
gathering
up
buffalo
bones
and
selling
them
by
the
ton
and
others
became
cowboys
iv
congressional
legislation
for
the
protection
of
the
bison
the
slaughter
of
the
buffalo
down
to
the
very
point
of
extermination
has
been
so
very
generally
condemned
and
the
general
government
has
been
so
unsparingly
blamed
for
allowing
such
a
massacre
to
take
place
on
the
public
domain
it
is
important
that
the
public
should
know
all
the
facts
in
the
case
to
the
credit
of
congress
it
must
be
said
that
several
very
determined
efforts
were
made
between
the
years
and
looking
toward
the
protection
of
the
buffalo
the
failure
of
all
those
efforts
was
due
to
our
republican
form
of
government
had
this
government
been
a
monarchy
the
buffalo
would
have
been
protected
but
unfortunately
in
this
case
perhaps
the
only
one
on
record
wherein
a
king
could
have
accomplished
more
than
the
representatives
of
the
people
the
necessary
act
of
congress
was
so
hedged
in
and
beset
by
obstacles
that
it
never
became
an
accomplished
fact
even
when
both
houses
of
congress
succeeded
in
passing
a
suitable
act
june
it
went
to
the
president
in
the
last
days
of
the
session
only
to
be
and
die
a
natural
death
the
following
is
a
complete
history
of
congressional
legislation
in
regard
to
the
protection
of
the
buffalo
from
wanton
slaughter
and
ultimate
extinction
the
first
step
taken
in

persecuted
animal
was
on
march
when

cox
said
he
had
been
told
by
old
hunters
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
sex
of
a
running
buffalo
and
he
also
stated
that
the
bill
gave
preference
to
the
indians
fort
said
the
object
was
to
prevent
early
extermination
that
thousands
were
annually
slaughtered
for
skins
alone
and
thousands
for
their
tongues
alone
that
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
are
killed
every
year
in
utter
wantonness
with
no
object
for
such
destruction
he
had
been
told
that
the
sexes
could
be
distinguished
while
they
were
running
note
i
know
of
no
greater
affront
that
could
be
offered
to
the
intelligence
of
a
genuine
than
to
accuse
him
of
not
knowing
enough
to
tell
the
sex
of
a
buffalo
on
the
run
by
its
form
w
this
bill
does
not
prohibit
any
person
joining
in
a
reasonable
chase
and
hunt
of
the
buffalo
said
fort
so
far
as
i
am
advised
gentlemen
upon
this
floor
representing
all
the
territories
are
favorable
to
the
passage
of
this
bill
cox
wanted
the
clause
excepting
the
indians
from
the
operations
of
the
bill
stricken
out
and
stated
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
already
said
to
the
house
that
the
civilization
of
the
indian
was
impossible
while
the
buffalo
remained
on
the
plains
the
clerk
read
for
mccormick
the
following
extract
from
the
a
paper
published
in
santa
fé
the
buffalo
slaughter
which
has
been
going
on
the
past
few
years
on
the
plains
and
which
increases
every
year
is
wantonly
wicked
and
should
be
stopped
by
the
most
stringent
enactments
and
most
vigilant
enforcements
of
the
law
killing
these
noble
animals
for
their
hides
simply
or
to
gratify
the
pleasure
of
some
russian
duke
or
english
lord
is
a
species
of
vandalism
which
can
not
too
quickly
be
checked
united
states
surveying
parties
report
that
there
are
two
thousand
hunters
on
the
plains
killing
these
animals
for
their
hides
one
party
of
sixteen
hunters
report
having
killed
thousand
buffaloes
during
the
past
summer
it
seems
to
us
there
is
quite
as
much
reason
why
the
government
should
protect
the
buffaloes
as
the
indians
mccormick
considered
the
subject
important
and
had
not
a
doubt
of
the
fearful
slaughter
he
read
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
that
he
had
received
from
general
hazen
i
know
a
man
who
killed
with
his
own
hand
buffaloes
in
one
day
without
taking
a
pound
of
the
meat
the
buffalo
for
food
has
an
intrinsic
value
about
equal
to
an
average
texas
beef
or
say
there
are
probably
not
less
than
a
million
of
these
animals
on
the
western
plains
if
the
government
owned
a
herd
of
a
million
oxen
they
would
at
least
take
steps
to
prevent
this
wanton
slaughter
the
railroads
have
made
the
buffalo
so
accessible
as
to
present
a
case
not
dissimilar
he
agreed
with
cox
that
some
features
of
the
bill
would
probably
be
impracticable
and
moved
to
amend
it
he
did
not
believe
any
bill
would
entirely
accomplish
the
purpose
but
he
desired
that
such
wanton
slaughter
should
be
stopped
said
he
it
would
have
been
well
both
for
the
indians
and
the
white
men
if
an
enactment
of
this
kind
had
been
placed
on
our
years
ago
i
know
of
no
one
act
that
would
gratify
the
red
men
more
holman
expressed
surprise
that
cox
should
make
any
objection
to
parts
of
the
measure
the
former
regarded
the
bill
as
an
effort
in
a
most
commendable
direction
and
trusted
that
it
would
pass
cox
said
he
would
not
have
objected
to
the
bill
but
from
the
fact
that
it
was
partial
in
its
provisions
he
wanted
a
bill
that
would
impose
a
penalty
on
every
man
red
white
or
black
who
may
wantonly
kill
these
buffaloes
potter
desired
to
know
whether
more
buffaloes
were
slaughtered
by
the
indians
than
by
white
men
fort
thought
the
white
men
were
doing
the
greatest
amount
of
killing
eldridge
thought
there
would
be
just
as
much
propriety
in
killing
the
fish
in
our
rivers
as
in
destroying
the
buffalo
in
order
to
compel
the
indians
to
become
civilized
conger
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
man
knows
the
range
of
the
buffalo
has
grown
more
and
more
confined
year
after
year
that
they
have
been
driven
westward
before
advancing
civilization
but
he
opposed
the
bill
hawley
of
connecticut
said
i
am
glad
to
see
this
bill
i
am
in
favor
of
this
law
and
hope
it
will
pass
lowe
favored
the
bill
and
thought
that
the
buffalo
ought
to
be
protected
for
proper
utility
cobb
thought
they
ought
to
be
protected
for
the
settlers
who
depended
partly
on
them
for
food
parker
of
missouri
intimated
that
the
policy
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
a
sound
one
and
that
the
buffaloes
ought
to
be
exterminated
to
prevent
difficulties
in
civilizing
the
indians
said
conger
i
do
not
think
the
measure
will
tend
at
all
to
protect
the
buffalo
mccormick
replied
this
bill
will
not
prevent
the
killing
of
buffaloes
for
any
useful
purpose
but
only
their
wanton
destruction
kasson
said
i
wish
to
say
one
word
in
support
of
this
bill
because
i
have
had
some
experience
as
to
the
manner
in
which
these
buffaloes
are
treated
by
hunters
the
buffalo
is
a
creature
of
vast
utility
this
animal
ought
to
be
protected
the
question

of

a
bill
restricting

which
was
referred
to
the
committee
on

never
heard
of
more
on

fort
introduced
a
bill
to
prevent
the
useless
slaughter
of
buffaloes
within
the
territories
of
the
united
states
which
was
referred
to
the
committee
on

pp
the
committee
on
the
territories
reported
back
the
bill
without
amendment
on
february
its
provisions
were
in
every
respect
identical
with
those
of
the
bill
introduced
by
fort
in
and
which
passed
both
houses
note
congress
first
session
vol
part
p
in
support
of
it
fort
said
the
intention
and
object
of
this
bill
is
to
preserve
them
the
buffaloes
for
the
use
of
the
indians
whose
homes
are
upon
the
public
domain
and
to
the
frontiersmen
who
may
properly
use
them
for
food
they
have
been
and
are
now
being
slaughtered
in
large
numbers
thousands
of
these
noble
brutes
are
annually
slaughtered
out
of
mere
wontonness
this
bill
just
as
it
is
now
presented
passed
the
last
congress
it
was
not
vetoed
but
fell
as
i
understand
merely
for
want
of
time
to
consider
it
after
having
passed
both
houses
he
also
intimated
that
the
government
was
using
a
great
deal
of
money
for
cattle
to
furnish
the
indians
while
the
buffalo
was
being
wantonly
destroyed
whereas
they
might
be
turned
to
their
good
crounse
wanted
the
words
who
is
not
an
indian
struck
out
so
as
to
make
the
bill
general
he
thought
indians
were
to
blame
for
the
wanton
destruction
fort
thought
the
amendment
unnecessary
and
stated
that
he
was
informed
that
the
indians
did
not
destroy
the
buffaloes
wantonly
dunnell
thought
the
bill
one
of
great
importance
the
clerk
read
for
him
a
letter
from
brackett
second
united
states
cavalry
stationed
at
omaha
barracks
in
which
was
a
very
urgent
request
to
have
congress
interfere
to
prevent
the
wholesale
slaughter
then
going
on
reagan
thought
the
bill
proper
and
right
he
knew
from
personal
experience
how
the
wanton
slaughtering
was
going
on
and
also
that
the
indians
were
the
ones
who
did
it
townsend
of
new
york
saw
no
reason
why
a
white
man
should
not
be
allowed
to
kill
a
female
buffalo
as
well
as
an
indian
he
said
it
would
be
impracticable
to
have
a
separate
law
for
each
maginnis
did
not
agree
with
him
he
thought
the
bill
ought
to
pass
as
it
stood
throckmorton
thought
that
while
the
intention
of
the
bill
was
a
good
one
yet
it
was
mischievous
and
difficult
to
enforce
and
would
also
work
hardship
to
a
large
portion
of
our
frontier
people
he
had
several
objections
he
also
thought
a
cow
buffalo
could
not
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
hancock
of
texas
thought
the
bill
an
impolicy
and
that
the
sooner
the
buffalo
was
exterminated
the
better
fort
replied
by
asking
him
why
all
the
game
deer
antelope
was
not
slaughtered
also
then
he
went
on
to
state
that
to
exterminate
the
buffalo
would
be
to
starve
innocent
children
of
the
red
man
and
to
make
the
latter
more
wild
and
savage
than
he
was
already
baker
of
indiana
offered
the
following
amendment
as
a
substitute
for
the
one
already
offered
that
any
white
person
who
shall
employ
hire
or
procure
directly
or
indirectly
any
indian
to
kill
any
buffalo
forbidden
to
be
killed
by
this
act
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
punished
in
the
manner
provided
in
this
act
fort
stated
that
a
certain
clause
in
his
bill
covered
the
object
of
the
amendment
jenks
offered
the
following
amendment
strike
out
in
the
fourth
line
of
the
second
section
the
word
can
and
insert
shall
and
in
the
second
line
of
the
same
section
insert
the
word
wantonly
before
kill
so
that
the
clause
will
read
that
it
shall
be
in
like
manner
unlawful
for
any
such
person
to
wantonly
kill
wound
or
destroy
in
the
said
territories
any
greater
number
of
male
buffaloes
than
are
needed
for
food
by
such
person
or
than
shall
be
used
cured
or
preserved
for
the
food
of
other
persons
or
for
the
market
conger
said
i
think
the
whole
bill
is
unwise
i
think
it
is
a
useless
measure
hancock
said
i
move
that
the
bill
and
amendment
be
laid
on
the
table
the
motion
to
lay
the
bill
upon
the
table
was
defeated
and
the
amendment
was
rejected
conger
called
for
a
division
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
the
house
divided
and
there
were
ayes
noes
he
then
demanded
tellers
and
they
reported
ayes
noes
so
the
bill
was
passed
on
february
the
bill
was
reported
to
the
senate
and
referred
to
the
committee
on
territories
from
whence
it
never
returned
on
march
fort
introduced
a
bill
to
tax
buffalo
hides
which
was
referred
to
the
committee
on
ways
and
means
and
never
heard
of
afterward
this
was
the
last
move
made
in
congress
in
behalf
of
the
buffalo
the
philanthropic
friends
of
the
frontiersman
the
indian
and
of
the
buffalo
himself
despaired
of
accomplishing
the
worthy
object
for
which
they
had
so
earnestly
and
persistently
labored
and
finally
gave
up
the
fight
at
the
very
time
the
effort
in
behalf
of
buffalo
protection
was
abandoned
the
northern
herd
still
flourished
and
might
have
been
preserved
from
extirpation
at
various
times
the
legislatures
of
a
few
of
the
western
states
and
territories
enacted
laws
vaguely
and
feebly
intended
to
provide
some
sort
of
protection
to
the
fast
disappearing
animals
one
of
the
first
was
the
game
law
of
colorado
passed
in
which
declared
that
the
killers
of
game
should
not
leave
any
flesh
to
spoil
the
western
game
laws
of
those
days
amounted
to
about
as
much
as
they
do
now
practically
nothing
at
all
i
have
never
been
able
to
learn
of
a
single
instance
save
in
the
yellowstone
park
wherein
a
western
hunter
was
prevented
by
so
simple
and
innocuous
a
thing
as
a
game
law
from
killing
game
laws
were
enacted
but
they
were
always
left
to
enforce
themselves
the
idea
of
the
frontiersman
the
average
at
least
has
always
been
to
kill
as
much
game
as
possible
before
some
other
fellow
gets
a
chance
at
it
before
it
is
all
killed
so
he
goes
at
the
game
and
as
a
general
thing
kills
all
he
can
while
it
lasts
and
with
it
feeds
himself
and
family
his
dogs
and
even
his
hogs
to
repletion
i
knew
one
montana
man
north
of
miles
city
who
killed
for
his
own
use
deer
in
one
season
and
had
so
much
more
venison
than
he
could
consume
or
give
away
that
a
great
pile
of
carcasses
lay
in
his
yard
until
spring
and
spoiled
during
the
existence
of
the
buffalo
it
was
declared
by
many
an
impossibility
to
stop
or
prevent
the
slaughter
such
an
accusation
of
weakness
and
imbecility
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
is
an
insult
to
our
strength
and
resources
the
protection
of
game
is
now
and
always
has
been
simply
a
question
of
money
a
proper
code
of
game
laws
and
a
reasonable
number
of
salaried
sworn
to
enforce
them
and
punish
all
offenses
against
them
would
have
afforded
the
buffalo
as
much
protection
as
would
have
been
necessary
to
his
continual
existence
to
be
sure
many
buffaloes
would
have
been
killed
on
the
sly
in
spite
of
laws
to
the
contrary
but
it
was
wholesale
slaughter
that
wrought
the
extermination
and
that
could
easily
have
been
prevented
a
tax
of
cents
each
on
buffalo
robes
would
have
maintained
a
sufficient
number
of
to
have
reasonably
regulated
the
killing
and
maintained
for
an
indefinite
period
a
bountiful
source
of
supply
of
food
and
also
raiment
for
both
the
white
man
of
the
plains
and
the
indian
by
judicious
management
the
buffalo
could
have
been
made
to
yield
an
annual
revenue
equal
to
that
we
now
receive
from
the
per
year
during
the
two
great
periods
of
slaughter
and
the
principal
killing
grounds
were
as
well
known
as
the
of
chicago
had
proper
laws
been
enacted
and
had
either
the
general
or
territorial
governments
entered
with
determination
upon
the
task
of
restricting
the
killing
of
buffaloes
to
proper
limits
their
enforcement
would
have
been
in
the
main
as
simple
and
easy
as
the
collection
of
taxes
of
course
the
solitary
hunter
in
a
remote
locality
would
have
bowled
over
his
half
dozen
buffaloes
in
secure
defiance
of
the
law
but
such
desultory
killing
could
not
have
made
much
impression
on
the
great
mass
for
many
years
the
wholesale
slaughter
wherein
one
hunter
would
openly
kill
five
thousand
buffaloes
and
market
perhaps
two
thousand
hides
could
easily
have
been
stopped
forever
buffalo
hides
could
not
have
been
dealt
in
clandestinely
for
many
reasons
and
had
there
been
no
sale
for
spoils
the
would
have
gathered
no
spoils
to
sell
it
was
an
undertaking
of
considerable
magnitude
and
involving
a
cash
outlay
of
several
hundred
dollars
to
make
up
an
outfit
of
wagons
horses
arms
and
ammunition
food
for
a
trip
to
the
range
after
buffaloes
it
was
these
wholesale
hunters
both
in
the
north
and
the
south
who
exterminated
the
species
and
to
say
that
all
such
undertakings
could
not
have
been
effectually
prevented
by
law
is
to
accuse
our
and
of
imbecility
to
a
degree
hitherto
unknown
there
is
nowhere
in
this
country
nor
in
any
of
the
waters
adjacent
to
it
a
living
species
of
any
kind
which
the
united
states
government
can
not
fully
and
perpetually
protect
from
destruction
by
human
agencies
if
it
chooses
to
do
so
the
destruction
of
the
buffalo
was
a
loss
of
wealth
perhaps
twenty
times
greater
than
the
sum
it
would
have
cost
to
conserve
it
and
this
stupendous
waste
of
valuable
food
and
other
products
was
committed
by
one
class
of
the
american
people
and
permitted
by
another
with
a
prodigality
and
wastefulness
which
even
in
the
lowest
savages
would
be
inexcusable
completeness
of
the
extermination
may
although
the
existence
of
a
few
individuals
enables
us
to
say
that
the
bison
is
not
yet
absolutely
extinct
in
a
wild
state
there
is
no
reason
to
hope
that
a
single
wild
and
unprotected
individual
will
remain
alive
ten
years
hence
the
nearer
the
species
approaches
to
complete
extermination
the
more
eagerly
are
the
wretched
fugitives
pursued
to
the
death
whenever
found
western
hunters
are
striving
for
the
honor
of
killing
the
last
buffalo
which
it
is
to
be
noted
has
already
been
slain
about
a
score
of
times
by
that
number
of
hunters
the
buffaloes
still
alive
in
a
wild
state
are
so
very
few
and
have
been
so
carefully
marked
down
by
hunters
it
is
possible
to
make
a
very
close
estimate
of
the
total
number
remaining
in
this
enumeration
the
small
herd
in
the
yellowstone
national
park
is
classed
with
other
herds
in
captivity
and
under
protection
for
the
reason
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
protection
afforded
by
the
law
and
the
officers
of
the
park
not
one
of
these
buffaloes
would
be
living
were
the
restrictions
of
the
law
removed
now
every
one
of
those
animals
would
be
killed
within
three
months
their
heads
alone
are
worth
from
to
each
to
taxidermists
and
for
this
reason
every
buffalo
is
a
prize
worth
the
hunter
winning
had
it
not
been
for
stringent
laws
and
a
rigid
enforcement
of
them
by
captain
harris
the
last
of
the
park
buffaloes
would
have
been
shot
years
ago
by
vic
smith
the
rea
brothers
and
other
hunters
of
whom
there
is
always
an
able
contingent
around
the
park
in
the
united
states
the
death
of
a
buffalo
is
now
such
an
event
that
it
is
immediately
chronicled
by
the
associated
press
and
telegraphed
all
over
the
country
by
reason
of
this
and
from
information
already
in
hand
we
are
able
to
arrive
at
a
very
fair
understanding
of
the
present
condition
of
the
species
in
a
wild
state
in
december
the
smithsonian
expedition
left
about
fifteen
buffaloes
alive
in
the
bad
lands
of
the
divide
at
the
head
of
big
porcupine
creek
in
three
of
these
were
killed
by
cowboys
and
in
two
more
the
last
death
recorded
being
that
of
an
old
bull
killed
near
billings
there
are
probably
eight
or
ten
stragglers
still
remaining
in
that
region
hiding
in
the
wildest
and
most
broken
tracts
of
the
bad
lands
as
far
as
possible
from
the
cattle
ranches
and
where
even
cowboys
seldom
go
save
on
a
from
the
fact
that
no
other
buffaloes
at
least
so
far
as
can
be
learned
have
been
killed
in
montana
during
the
last
two
years
i
am
convinced
that
the
bunch
referred
to
are
the
last
representatives
of
the
species
remaining
in
montana
in
the
spring
of
winston
while
on
a
hunting
trip
about
miles
west
of
grand
rapids
dakota
saw
seven
buffaloes
five
adult
animals
and
two
calves
of
which
he
killed
one
a
large
bull
and
caught
a
calf
alive
on
september
a
solitary
bull
was
killed
miles
from
the
town
of
oakes
in
dickey
county
there
are
still
three
individuals
in
the
unsettled
country
lying
between
that
point
and
the
missouri
which
are
undoubtedly
the
only
wild
representatives
of
the
race
east
of
the
missouri
river
on
april
william
stephenson
of
the
united
states
army
wrote
me
as
follows
from
pilot
butte
about
miles
north
of
rock
springs
wyoming
there
are
undoubtedly
buffalo
within
or
miles
of
here
two
having
been
killed
out
of
a
band
of
eighteen
some
ten
days
since
by
cowboys
and
another
band
of
four
seen
near
there
i
hear
from
cattlemen
of
their
being
seen
every
year
north
and
northeast
of
here
this
band
was
seen
once
in
in
february
hon
joseph
carey
member
of
congress
from
wyoming
received
a
letter
informing
him
that
this
band
of
buffaloes
consisting
of
head
had
been
seen
grazing
in
the
red
desert
of
wyoming
and
that
the
indians
were
preparing
to
attack
it
at
judge
carey
request
the
indian
bureau
issued
orders
which
it
was
hoped
would
prevent
the
slaughter
so
until
further
developments
we
have
the
pleasure
of
recording
the
presence
of
wild
buffaloes
in
southern
wyoming
there
are
no
buffaloes
whatever
in
the
vicinity
of
the
yellowstone
park
either
in
wyoming
montana
or
idaho
save
what
wander
out
of
that
reservation
and
when
any
do
they
are
speedily
killed
there
is
a
rumor
that
there
are
ten
or
twelve
mountain
buffaloes
still
on
foot
in
colorado
in
a
region
called
lost
park
and
while
it
lacks
confirmation
we
gladly
accept
it
as
a
fact
in
cory
of
boston
saw
in
denver
colorado
eight
fresh
buffalo
skins
which
it
was
said
had
come
from
the
region
named
above
in
there
was
a
herd
of
about
forty
mountain
buffalo
near
south
park
and
although
some
of
the
number
may
still
survive
the
indications
are
that
the
total
number
of
wild
buffaloes
in
colorado
does
not
exceed
twenty
individuals
in
texas
a
miserable
remnant
of
the
great
southern
herd
still
remains
in
the
country
between
the
two
forks
of
the
canadian
river
in
about
two
hundred
head
survived
which
number
by
the
summer
of
had
been
reduced
to
one
hundred
or
less
in
the
hunting
season
of
a
ranchman
named
lee
howard
fitted
out
and
led
a
strong
party
into
the
haunts
of
the
survivors
and
killed
of
them
in
may
jones
again
visited
this
region
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
buffaloes
alive
his
party
found
from
first
to
last
buffaloes
of
which
they
captured
eighteen
head
eleven
adult
cows
and
seven
calves
the
greatest
feat
ever
accomplished
in
it
is
highly
probable
that
jones
and
his
men
saw
about
all
the
buffaloes
now
living
in
the
country
and
it
therefore
seems
quite
certain
that
not
over
individuals
remain
these
are
so
few
so
remote
and
so
difficult
to
reach
it
is
to
be
hoped
no
one
will
consider
them
worth
going
after
and
that
they
will
be
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
it
is
greatly
to
be
regretted
that
the
state
of
texas
does
not
feel
disposed
to
make
a
special
effort
for
their
protection
and
preservation
in
regard
to
the
existence
of
wild
buffaloes
in
the
british
possessions
the
statements
of
different
authorities
are
at
variance
by
far
the
larger
number
holding
the
opinion
that
there
are
in
all
the
northwest
territory
only
a
few
almost
solitary
stragglers
but
there
is
still
good
reason
for
the
hope
and
also
the
belief
that
there
still
remain
in
athabasca
between
the
athabasca
and
peace
rivers
at
least
a
few
hundred
wood
buffalo
in
a
very
interesting
and
article
in
the
london
of
november
miller
christy
quotes
all
the
available
positive
evidence
bearing
on
this
point
and
i
gladly
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
reproduce
it
here
the
hon
schulz
in
the
recent
debate
on
the
mackenzie
river
basin
in
the
canadian
senate
quoted
senator
hardisty
of
edmonton
of
the
hudson
bay
company
to
the
effect
that
the
wood
buffalo
still
existed
in
the
region
in
question
was
he
said
to
estimate
how
many
but
probably
five
or
six
hundred
still
remain
in
scattered
bands
there
had
been
no
appreciable
difference
in
their
numbers
he
thought
during
the
last
fifteen
years
as
they
could
not
be
hunted
on
horseback
on
account
of
the
wooded
character
of
the
country
and
were
therefore
very
little
molested
they
are
larger
than
the
buffalo
of
the
great
plains
weighing
at
least
pounds
more
they
are
also
coarser
haired
and
straighter
horned
the
doctor
also
quoted
frank
oliver
of
edmonton
to
the
effect
that
the
wood
buffalo
still
exists
in
small
numbers
between
the
lower
peace
and
great
slave
rivers
extending
westward
from
the
latter
to
the
salt
river
in
latitude
degrees
and
also
between
the
peace
and
athabasca
rivers
he
states
that
are
larger
than
the
prairie
buffalo
and
the
fur
is
darker
but
practically
they
are
the
same
animal
some
buffalo
meat
is
brought
in
every
winter
to
the
bay
company
posts
nearest
the
buffalo
ranges
schulz
further
stated
that
he
had
received
the
following
testimony
from
donald
ross
of
edmonton
the
wood
buffalo
still
exists
in
the
localities
named
about
one
was
killed
as
far
west
on
peace
river
as
port
dunvegan
they
are
quite
different
from
the
prairie
buffalo
being
nearly
double
the
size
as
they
will
dress
fully
pounds
it
will
be
apparent
to
most
observers
i
think
that
statement
in
regard
to
the
size
of
the
wood
buffalo
is
a
random
shot
in
a
private
letter
to
the
writer
under
date
of
october
harrison
young
of
the
hudson
bay
company
post
at
edmonton
writes
as
follows
the
buffalo
are
not
yet
extinct
in
the
northwest
there
are
still
some
stray
ones
on
the
prairies
away
to
the
south
of
this
but
they
must
be
very
few
i
am
unable
to
find
any
one
who
has
personal
knowledge
of
the
killing
of
one
during
the
last
two
years
though
i
have
since
the
receipt
of
your
letter
questioned
a
good
many
on
the
subject
in
our
district
of
athabasca
along
the
salt
river
there
are
still
a
few
wood
buffalo
killed
every
year
but
they
are
fast
diminishing
in
numbers
and
are
also
becoming
very
shy
in
his
manitoba
and
the
great
northwest
john
macoun
has
this
to
say
regarding
the
presence
of
the
wood
buffalo
in
the
region
referred
to
the
wood
buffalo
when
i
was
on
the
peace
river
in
were
confined
to
the
country
lying
between
the
athabasca
and
peace
rivers
north
of
latitude
or
chiefly
in
the
birch
hills
they
were
also
said
to
be
in
some
abundance
on
the
salt
and
hay
rivers
running
into
the
save
river
north
of
peace
river
the
herds
thirteen
years
ago
now
nineteen
were
supposed
to
number
about
one
thousand
all
told
i
believe
many
still
exist
as
the
indians
of
that
region
eat
fish
which
are
much
easier
procured
than
either
buffalo
or
moose
and
the
country
is
much
too
difficult
for
white
men
all
this
evidence
when
carefully
considered
resolves
itself
into
simply
this
and
no
more
the
only
evidence
in
favor
of
the
existence
of
any
live
buffaloes
between
the
athabasca
and
peace
rivers
is
in
the
form
of
very
old
rumors
most
of
them
nearly
fifteen
years
old
time
enough
for
the
indians
to
have
procured
in
abundance
and
killed
all
those
buffaloes
two
or
three
times
over
miller
christy
takes
the
mean
of
the
estimates
and
assumes
that
there
are
now
about
five
hundred
and
fifty
buffaloes
in
the
region
named
if
we
are
to
believe
in
the
existence
there
of
any
stragglers
his
estimate
is
a
fair
one
and
we
will
gladly
accept
it
the
total
is
therefore
as
follows
of
american
bison
running
wild
and
unprotected

january

of
texas

add
to
the
above
the
total
number
already
recorded
in
captivity
and
those
under
government
protection
in
the
yellowstone
park
and
the
whole
number
of
individuals
of
now
living
is
from
this
time
it
is
probable
that
many
rumors
of
the
sudden
appearance
of
herds
of
buffaloes
will
become
current
already
there
have
been
three
or
four
that
almost
deserve
special
mention
the
first
appeared
in
march
when
various
western
newspapers
published
a
circumstantial
account
of
how
a
herd
of
about
three
hundred
buffaloes
swam
the
missouri
river
about
miles
above
bismarck
near
the
town
of
painted
woods
and
ran
on
in
a
southwesterly
direction
a
letter
of
inquiry
addressed
to
peterson
postmaster
at
painted
woods
elicited
the
following
reply
the
whole
rumor
is
false
and
without
any
foundation
i
saw
it
first
in
the
newspaper
where
i
believe
it
originated
in
these
days
of
railroads
and
numberless
hunting
parties
there
is
not
the
remotest
possibility
of
there
being
anywhere
in
the
united
states
a
herd
of
a
hundred
or
even
fifty
buffaloes
which
has
escaped
observation
of
the
head
still
existing
in
a
wild
state
it
may
safely
be
predicted
that
not
even
one
will
remain
alive
five
years
hence
a
buffalo
is
now
so
great
a
prize
and
by
the
ignorant
it
is
considered
so
great
an
honor
to
kill
one
that
extraordinary
exertions
will
be
made
to
find
and
shoot
down
without
mercy
the
last
buffalo
there
is
no
possible
chance
for
the
race
to
be
perpetuated
in
a
wild
state
and
in
a
few
years
more
hardly
a
bone
will
remain
above
ground
to
mark
the
existence
of
the
must
prolific
mammalian
species
that
ever
existed
so
far
as
we
know
vi
effects
of
the
extermination
the
buffalo
supplied
the
indian
with
food
clothing
shelter
bedding
saddles
ropes
shields
and
innumerable
smaller
articles
of
use
and
ornament
in
the
united
states
a
paternal
government
takes
the
place
of
the
buffalo
in
supplying
all
these
wants
of
the
red
man
and
it
costs
several
millions
of
dollars
annually
to
accomplish
the
task
the
following
are
the
tribes
which
depended
very
largely
some
almost
wholly
upon
the
buffalo
for
the
necessities
and
many
of
the
luxuries
of
their
savage
life
until
the
government
began
to
support
them
blood
and
blackfeet
ventres
and
shoshone
percé
and
comanches
total
this
enumeration
from
the
census
of
leaves
entirely
out
of
consideration
many
thousands
of
indians
living
in
the
indian
territory
and
other
portions
of
the
southwest
who
drew
an
annual
supply
of
meat
and
robes
from
the
chase
of
the
buffalo
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
their
chief
dependence
was
upon
agriculture
the
indians
of
what
was
once
the
buffalo
country
are
not
starving
and
freezing
for
the
reason
that
the
united
states
government
supplies
them
regularly
with
beef
and
blankets
in
lieu
of
buffalo
does
any
one
imagine
that
the
government
could
not
have
regulated
the
killing
of
buffaloes
and
thus
maintained
the
supply
for
far
less
money
than
it
now
costs
to
feed
and
clothe
those
indians
how
is
it
with
the
indians
of
the
british
possessions
john
maconn
writes
as
follows
in
his
manitoba
and
the
great
northwest
page
during
the
last
three
years
prior
to
the
great
herds
have
been
kept
south
of
our
boundary
and
as
the
result
of
this
our
indians
have
been
on
the
verge
of
starvation
when
the
hills
were
covered
with
countless
thousands
of
buffaloes
in
the
blackfeet
were
dying
of
starvation
in
during
the
winter
of
destitution
and
actual
starvation
prevailed
to
an
alarming
extent
among
certain
tribes
of
indians
in
the
northwest
territory
who
once
lived
bountifully
on
the
buffalo
a
terrible
tale
of
suffering
in
the
athabasca
and
peace
river
country
has
recently
come
to
the
minister
of
the
interior
of
the
canadian
government
in
the
form
of
a
petition
signed
by
the
bishop
of
that
diocese
six
clergymen
and
missionaries
and
several
justices
of
the
peace
it
sets
forth
that
owing
to
the
destruction
of
game
the
indians
both
last
winter
and
last
summer
have
been
in
a
state
of
starvation
they
are
now
in
a
complete
state
of
destitution
and
are
utterly
unable
to
provide
themselves
with
clothing
shelter
ammunition
or
food
for
the
coming
winter
the
petition
declares
that
on
account
of
starvation
and
consequent
cannibalism
a
party
of
cree
indians
was
reduced
to
three
in
the
winter
of
of
the
fort
chippewyan
indians
between
twenty
and
thirty
starved
to
death
last
winter
and
the
death
of
many
more
was
hastened
by
want
of
food
and
by
famine
diseases
many
other
indians
crees
beavers
and
chippewyans
at
almost
all
points
where
there
are
missions
or
trading
posts
would
certainly
have
starved
to
death
but
for
the
help
given
them
by
the
traders
and
missionaries
at
those
places
it
is
now
declared
by
the
signers
of
the
memorial
that
scores
of
families
having
lost
their
heads
by
starvation
are
now
perfectly
helpless
and
during
the
coming
winter
must
either
starve
to
death
or
eat
one
another
unless
help
comes
stories
of
suffering
and
cannibalism
continue
to
come
in
from
what
was
once
the
buffalo
plains
note
it
was
the
cree
indians
who
used
to
practice
impounding
buffaloes
slaughtering
a
penful
of
two
hundred
head
at
a
time
with
most
fiendish
glee
and
leaving
all
but
the
very
choicest
of
the
meat
to
putrefy
if
ever
thoughtless
people
were
punished
for
their
reckless
improvidence
the
indians
and
of
the
northwest
territory
are
now
paying
the
penalty
for
the
wasteful
slaughter
of
the
buffalo
a
few
short
years
ago
the
buffalo
is
his
own
avenger
to
an
extent
his
remorseless
slayers
little
dreamed
he
ever
could
be
vii
preservation
of
the
species
from
absolute
extinction
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
unless
the
united
states
government
takes
the
matter
in
hand
and
makes
a
special
effort
to
prevent
it
the
bison
will
be
lost
irretrievably
through
mixture
with
domestic
breeds
and
through
breeding
the
fate
of
the
yellowstone
park
herd
is
to
say
the
least
highly
uncertain
a
distinguished
senator
who
is
deeply
interested
in
legislation
for
the
protection
of
the
national
park
reservation
has
declared
that
the
pressure
from
railway
corporations
which
are
seeking
a
in
the
park
has
become
so
great
and
so
aggressive
that
he
fears
the
park
will
eventually
be
broken
up
in
any
such
event
the
destruction
of
the
herd
of
park
buffaloes
would
be
one
of
the
very
first
results
if
the
park
is
properly
maintained
however
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
buffaloes
now
in
it
will
remain
there
and
increase
indefinitely
as
yet
there
are
only
two
captive
buffaloes
in
the
possession
of
the
government
viz
those
in
the
department
of
living
animals
of
the
national
museum
presented
by
hon
blackford
of
new
york
the
buffaloes
now
in
the
zoological
gardens
of
the
country
are
but
few
in
number
and
unless
special
pains
be
taken
to
prevent
it
by
means
of
judicious
exchanges
from
time
to
time
these
will
rapidly
deteriorate
in
size
and
within
a
comparatively
short
time
run
out
entirely
through
continued
breeding
it
is
said
that
even
the
wild
aurochs
in
the
forests
of
lithuania
are
decreasing
in
size
and
in
number
from
this
cause
with
private
owners
of
captive
buffaloes
the
temptations
to
produce
will
be
so
great
that
it
is
more
than
likely
the
breeding
of
buffaloes
will
be
neglected
indeed
unless
some
stockman
like
jones
takes
particular
pains
to
protect
his
full
blood
buffaloes
and
keep
the
breed
absolutely
pure
in
twenty
years
there
will
not
be
a
animal
of
that
species
on
any
stock
farm
in
this
country
under
existing
conditions
the
constant
tendency
of
the
numerous
domestic
forms
is
to
absorb
and
utterly
obliterate
the
few
wild
ones
if
we
may
judge
from
the
examples
set
as
by
european
governments
it
is
clearly
the
duty
of
our
government
to
act
in
this
matter
and
act
promptly
with
a
degree
of
liberality
and
promptness
which
can
not
be
otherwise
than
highly
gratifying
to
every
american
citizen
and
every
friend
of
science
throughout
the
world
the
fiftieth
congress
at
its
last
session
responded
to
the
call
made
upon
it
and
voted
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
zoological
park
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
a
grand
scale
one
of
the
leading
purposes
it
is
destined
to
serve
is
the
preservation
and
breeding
in
comfortable
and
so
far
as
space
is
concerned
luxurious
captivity
of
a
number
of
fine
specimens
of
every
species
of
american
quadruped
now
threatened
with
extermination
note
it
is
indeed
an
unbounded
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
now
record
the
fact
that
this
important
task
in
which
every
american
citizen
has
a
personal
interest
is
actually
to
be
undertaken
last
year
we
could
only
way
it
ought
to
be
undertaken
in
its
accomplishment
the
government
expects
the
of
private
individuals
all
over
the
country
in
the
form
of
gifts
of
desirable
living
animals
for
no
government
could
afford
to
purchase
all
the
animals
necessary
for
a
great
zoological
garden
provide
for
their
wants
in
a
liberal
way
and
yet
give
the
public
free
access
to
the
collection
as
is
to
be
given
to
the
national
zoological
park
at
least
eight
or
ten
buffaloes
of
pure
breed
should
be
secured
very
soon
by
the
zoological
park
commission
by
gift
if
possible
and
cared
for
with
special
reference
to
keeping
the
breed
absolutely
pure
and
the
herd
from
deteriorating
and
dying
out
through
the
total
expense
would
be
trifling
in
comparison
with
the
importance
of
the
end
to
be
gained
and
in
that
way
we
might
in
a
small
measure
atone
for
our
neglect
of
the
means
which
would
have
protected
the
great
herds
from
extinction
in
this
way
by
proper
management
it
will
be
not
only
possible
but
easy
to
preserve
fine
living
representatives
of
this
important
species
for
centuries
to
come
the
result
of
continuing
is
certain
extinction
its
progress
may
be
so
slow
as
to
make
no
impression
upon
the
mind
of
a
but
the
end
is
only
a
question
of
time
the
fate
of
a
majority
of
the
herds
of
british
wild
cattle
warn
us
what
to
expect
with
the
american
bison
under
similar
circumstances
of
the
fourteen
herds
of
wild
cattle
which
were
in
existence
in
england
and
scotland
during
the
early
part
of
the
present
century
direct
descendants
of
the
wild
herds
found
in
great
britain
nine
have
become
totally
extinct
through
in
breeding
the
five
herds
remaining
are
those
at
somerford
park
blickling
hall
woodbastwick
chartley
and
chillingham
part
the
smithsonian
expedition
for
museum
specimens
i
the
exploration
during
the
first
three
months
of
the
year
it
was
ascertained
by
the
writer
then
chief
taxidermist
of
the
national
museum
that
the
extermination
of
the
american
bison
had
made
most
alarming
progress
by
extensive
correspondence
it
was
learned
that
the
destruction
of
all
the
large
herds
both
north
and
south
was
already
an
accomplished
fact
while
it
was
generally
supposed
that
at
least
a
few
thousand
individuals
still
inhabited
the
more
remote
and
inaccessible
regions
of
what
once
constituted
the
great
northern
buffalo
range
it
was
found
that
the
actual
number
remaining
in
the
whole
united
states
was
probably
less
than
three
hundred
by
some
authorities
who
were
consulted
it
was
considered
an
impossibility
to
procure
a
large
series
of
specimens
anywhere
in
this
country
while
others
asserted
positively
that
there
were
no
wild
buffaloes
south
of
the
british
possessions
save
those
in
the
yellowstone
national
park
canadian
authorities
asserted
with
equal
positiveness
that
none
remained
in
their
territory
a
careful
inventory
of
the
specimens
in
the
collection
of
the
national
museum
revealed
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
one
mounted
female
skin
another
unmounted
and
one
mounted
skeleton
of
a
male
buffalo
the
museum
was
actually
without
presentable
specimens
of
this
most
important
and
interesting
mammal
besides
those
mentioned
above
the
collection
contained
only
two
old
badly
mounted
and
dilapidated
skins
one
of
which
had
been
taken
in
summer
and
therefore
was
not
representative
an
incomplete
skeleton
some
fragmentary
skulls
of
no
value
and
two
mounted
heads
thus
it
appeared
that
the
museum
was
unable
to
show
a
series
of
specimens
good
or
bad
or
even
one
presentable
male
of
good
size
in
view
of
this
alarming
state
of
affairs
coupled
with
the
already
declared
extinction
of
the
secretary
of
the
smithsonian
institution
spencer
baird
determined
to
send
a
party
into
the
field
at
once
to
find
wild
buffalo
if
any
were
still
living
and
in
case
any
were
found
to
collect
a
number
of
specimens
since
it
seemed
highly
uncertain
whether
any
other
institution
or
any
private
individual
would
have
the
opportunity
to
collect
a
large
supply
of
specimens
before
it
became
too
late
it
was
decided
by
the
secretary
that
the
smithsonian
institution
should
undertake
the
task
of
providing
for
the
future
as
liberally
as
possible
for
the
benefit
of
the
smaller
scientific
museums
of
the
country
and
for
others
which
will
come
into
existence
during
the
next
half
century
it
was
resolved
to
collect
at
all
hazards
in
case
buffalo
could
be
found
between
eighty
and
one
hundred
specimens
of
various
kinds
of
which
from
twenty
to
thirty
should
be
skins
an
equal
number
should
be
complete
skeletons
and
of
skulls
at
least
fifty
in
view
of
the
great
scarcity
of
buffalo
and
the
general
belief
that
it
might
be
a
work
of
some
months
to
find
any
specimens
even
if
it
were
possible
to
find
any
at
all
it
was
determined
not
to
risk
the
success
of
the
undertaking
by
delaying
it
until
the
regular
autumn
hunting
season
but
to
send
a
party
into
the
field
at
once
to
prosecute
a
search
it
was
resolved
to
discover
at
all
hazards
the
whereabouts
of
any
buffalo
that
might
still
remain
in
this
country
in
a
wild
state
and
if
possible
to
reach
them
before
the
shedding
of
their
winter
pelage
it
very
soon
became
apparent
however
that
the
latter
would
prove
an
utter
impossibility
late
in
the
month
of
april
a
letter
was
received
from
merrill
united
states
army
dated
at
huntley
montana
giving
information
of
reports
that
buffalo
were
still
to
be
found
in
three
localities
in
the
northwest
viz
on
the
headwaters
of
the
powder
river
wyoming
in
judith
basin
montana
and
on
big
dry
creek
also
in
montana
the
reports
in
regard
to
the
first
two
localities
proved
to
be
erroneous
it
was
ascertained
to
a
reasonable
certainty
that
there
still
existed
in
southwestern
dakota
a
small
band
of
six
or
eight
wild
buffaloes
while
from
the
of
texas
there
came
reports
of
the
existence
there
in
small
scattered
hands
of
about
two
hundred
head
the
buffalo
known
to
be
in
dakota
were
far
too
few
in
number
to
justify
a
long
and
expensive
search
while
those
in
texas
on
the
canadian
river
were
too
difficult
to
reach
to
make
it
advisable
to
hunt
them
save
as
a
last
resort
it
was
therefore
decided
to
investigate
the
localities
named
in
the
northwest
through
the
courtesy
of
the
secretary
of
war
an
order
was
sent
to
the
officer
commanding
the
department
of
dakota
requesting
him
to
furnish
the
party
through
the
officers
in
command
at
forts
keogh
maginnis
and
mckinney
such
field
transportation
escort
and
camp
equipage
as
might
be
necessary
and
also
to
sell
to
the
party
such
commissary
stores
as
might
be
required
at
cost
price
plus
per
cent
the
secretary
of
the
interior
also
favored
the
party
with
an
order
directing
all
indian
agents
scouts
and
others
in
the
service
of
the
department
to
render
assistance
as
far
as
possible
when
called
upon
in
view
of
the
public
interest
attaching
to
the
results
of
the
expedition
the
railway
transportation
of
the
party
to
and
from
montana
was
furnished
entirely
without
cost
to
the
smithsonian
institution
for
these
valuable
courtesies
we
gratefully
acknowledge
our
obligations
to
frank
thomson
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
roswell
miller
of
the
chicago
milwaukee
and
paul
and
robert
harris
of
the
northern
pacific
under
orders
from
the
secretary
of
the
smithsonian
institution
the
writer
left
washington
on
may
accompanied
by
forney
assistant
in
the
department
of
taxidermy
and
george
hedley
of
medina
new
york
it
had
been
decided
that
miles
city
montana
might
properly
be
taken
as
the
first
objective
point
and
that
town
was
reached
on
may
diligent
inquiry
in
miles
city
and
at
fort
keogh
miles
distant
revealed
the
fact
that
no
one
knew
of
the
presence
of
any
wild
buffalo
anywhere
in
the
northwest
save
within
the
protected
limits
of
the
yellowstone
park
all
inquiries
elicited
the
same
reply
there
are
no
buffalo
any
more
and
you
ca
get
any
anywhere
many
persons
who
were
considered
good
authority
declared
most
positively
that
there
was
not
a
live
buffalo
in
the
vicinity
of
big
dry
creek
nor
anywhere
between
the
yellowstone
and
missouri
rivers
an
army
officer
from
fort
maginnis
testified
to
the
total
absence
of
buffalo
in
the
judith
basin
and
ranchmen
from
wyoming
asserted
that
none
remained
in
the
powder
river
country
just
at
this
time
it
was
again
reported
to
us
and
most
opportunely
confirmed
by
henry
phillips
owner
of
the
ranch
on
little
dry
creek
that
there
still
remained
a
chance
to
find
a
few
buffalo
in
the
country
lying
south
of
the
big
dry
on
the
other
hand
other
persons
who
seemed
to
be
fully
informed
regarding
that
very
region
and
the
animal
life
it
contained
assured
us
that
not
a
single
buffalo
remained
there
and
that
a
search
in
that
direction
would
prove
fruitless
but
the
balance
of
evidence
however
seemed
to
lie
in
favor
of
the
big
dry
country
and
we
resolved
to
hunt
through
it
with
all
possible
dispatch
on
the
afternoon
of
may
we
crossed
the
yellowstone
and
started
northwest
up
the
trail
which
leads
along
sunday
creek
our
entire
party
consisted
of
the
two
assistants
already
mentioned
a
officer
sergeant
garone
and
four
men
from
the
fifth
infantry
acting
as
escort
private
jones
also
from
the
fifth
infantry
detailed
to
act
as
our
cook
and
a
teamster
our
conveyance
consisted
of
a
team
which
like
the
escort
was
ordered
out
for
twenty
days
only
and
provided
accordingly
before
leaving
miles
city
we
purchased
two
for
use
in
hunting
the
equipments
for
which
were
furnished
by
the
ordnance
department
at
fort
keogh
during
the
first
two
days
travel
through
the
bad
lands
north
of
the
yellowstone
no
mammals
were
seen
save
and
rabbits
on
the
third
day
a
few
antelope
were
seen
but
none
killed
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
entire
region
is
absolutely
treeless
everywhere
save
along
the
margins
of
the
largest
streams
bushes
are
also
entirely
absent
with
the
exception
of
and
even
that
does
not
occur
to
any
extent
on
the
divides
on
the
third
day
two
young
buck
antelopes
were
shot
at
the
red
buttes
one
had
already
commenced
to
shed
his
hair
but
the
other
had
not
quite
reached
that
point
we
prepared
the
skin
of
the
first
specimen
and
the
skeleton
of
the
other
this
was
the
only
good
antelope
skin
we
obtained
in
the
spring
those
of
all
the
other
specimens
taken
being
quite
worthless
on
account
of
the
looseness
of
the
hair
during
the
latter
part
of
may
and
from
that
time
on
until
the
long
winter
hair
is
completely
shed
it
falls
off
in
handfuls
at
the
slightest
pressure
leaving
the
skin
clad
only
with
a
thin
growth
of
new
hair
an
eighth
of
an
inch
long
after
reaching
little
dry
creek
and
hunting
through
the
country
on
the
west
side
of
it
nearly
to
its
confluence
with
the
big
dry
we
turned
southwest
and
finally
went
into
permanent
camp
on
phillips
creek
miles
above
the
ranch
and
miles
from
the
little
dry
at
that
point
we
were
about
miles
from
miles
city
from
information
furnished
us
by
phillips
and
the
cowboys
in
his
employ
we
were
assured
that
about
head
of
buffalo
ranged
in
the
bad
lands
between
phillips
creek
and
the
musselshell
river
and
south
of
the
big
dry
this
tract
of
country
was
about
miles
long
from
east
to
west
by
miles
wide
and
therefore
of
about
square
miles
in
area
excepting
two
temporary
cowboy
camps
it
was
totally
uninhabited
by
man
treeless
without
any
running
streams
save
in
winter
and
spring
and
was
mostly
very
hilly
and
broken
in
this
desolate
and
inhospitable
country
the
buffaloes
alluded
to
had
been
seen
first
on
sand
creek
then
at
the
head
of
the
big
porcupine
again
near
the
musselshell
and
latest
near
the
head
of
the
little
dry
as
these
points
were
all
from
to
miles
distant
from
each
other
the
difficulty
of
finding
such
a
small
herd
becomes
apparent
although
phillips
creek
was
really
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
buffalo
country
it
was
impossible
for
a
wagon
to
proceed
beyond
it
at
least
at
that
point
having
established
a
permanent
camp
the
government
wagon
and
its
escort
returned
to
fort
keogh
and
we
proceeded
to
hunt
through
the
country
between
sand
creek
and
the
little
dry
the
absence
of
nearly
all
the
cowboys
on
the
spring
which
began
may
threatened
to
be
a
serious
drawback
to
us
as
we
greatly
needed
the
services
of
a
man
who
was
acquainted
with
the
country
we
had
with
us
as
a
scout
and
guide
a
cheyenne
indian
named
dog
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
he
knew
no
more
about
the
country
than
we
did
fortunately
however
we
succeeded
in
occasionally
securing
the
services
of
a
cowboy
which
was
of
great
advantage
to
us
it
was
our
custom
to
ride
over
the
country
daily
each
day
making
a
circuit
through
a
new
locality
and
covering
as
much
ground
as
it
was
possible
to
ride
over
in
a
day
it
was
also
our
custom
to
take
trips
of
from
two
to
four
days
in
length
during
which
we
carried
our
blankets
and
rations
upon
our
horses
and
camped
wherever
night
overtook
us
provided
water
could
be
found
our
first
success
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
buffalo
calf
which
from
excessive
running
had
become
unable
to
keep
up
with
its
mother
and
had
been
left
behind
the
calf
was
caught
alive
without
any
difficulty
and
while
two
of
the
members
of
our
party
carried
it
to
camp
across
a
horse
the
other
two
made
a
vigorous
effort
to
discover
the
band
of
adult
animals
the
effort
was
unsuccessful
for
besides
the
calf
no
other
buffaloes
were
seen
ten
days
after
the
above
event
two
bull
buffaloes
were
met
with
on
the
little
dry
miles
above
the
ranch
one
of
which
was
overtaken
and
killed
but
the
other
got
safely
away
the
shedding
of
the
winter
coat
was
in
full
progress
on
the
head
neck
and
shoulders
the
old
hair
had
been
entirely
replaced
by
the
new
although
the
two
coats
were
so
matted
together
that
the
old
hair
clung
in
tangled
masses
to
the
other
the
old
hair
was
brown
and
but
the
new
which
was
from
to
inches
long
had
a
peculiar
appearance
on
the
head
the
new
hair
was
quite
black
and
contrasted
oddly
with
the
lighter
color
on
the
body
and
hind
quarters
there
were
large
patches
of
skin
which
were
perfectly
bare
between
which
lay
large
patches
of
old
woolly
brown
hair
this
curious
condition
gave
the
animal
a
very
unkempt
and
seedy
appearance
the
effect
of
which
was
heightened
by
the
long
shaggy
locks
of
old
weather
beaten
hair
which
clung
to
the
new
coat
of
the
neck
and
shoulders
like
tattered
signals
of
distress
ready
to
be
blown
away
by
the
first
gust
of
wind
this
specimen
was
a
large
one
measuring
feet
inches
in
height
inasmuch
as
the
skin
was
not
in
condition
to
mount
we
took
only
the
skeleton
entire
and
the
skin
of
the
head
and
neck
the
capture
of
the
calf
and
the
death
of
this
bull
proved
conclusively
that
there
were
buffaloes
in
that
region
and
also
that
they
were
breeding
in
comparative
security
the
extent
of
the
country
they
had
to
range
over
made
it
reasonably
certain
that
their
number
would
not
be
diminished
to
any
serious
extent
by
the
cowboys
on
the
spring
although
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
in
a
few
months
the
members
of
that
band
would
all
be
killed
the
report
of
the
existence
of
a
herd
of
head
was
confirmed
later
by
cowboys
who
had
actually
seen
the
animals
and
killed
two
of
them
merely
for
sport
as
usual
they
saved
a
few
pounds
of
hump
meat
and
all
the
rest
became
food
for
the
wolves
and
foxes
it
was
therefore
resolved
to
leave
the
buffaloes
entirely
unmolested
until
autumn
and
then
when
the
robes
would
be
in
the
finest
condition
return
for
a
hunt
on
a
liberal
scale
accordingly
it
was
decided
to
return
to
washington
without
delay
and
a
courier
was
dispatched
with
a
request
for
transportation
to
carry
our
party
back
to
fort
keogh
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
wagons
a
cowboy
in
the
employ
of
the
phillips
land
and
cattle
company
killed
a
solitary
bull
buffalo
about
miles
west
of
our
camp
near
sand
creek
this
animal
had
completely
shed
the
hair
on
his
body
and
hind
quarters
in
addition
to
the
preservation
of
his
entire
skeleton
we
prepared
the
skin
also
as
an
example
of
the
condition
of
the
buffalo
immediately
after
shedding
on
june
the
teams
from
fort
keogh
arrived
and
we
immediately
returned
to
miles
city
taking
with
us
our
live
buffalo
calf
two
fresh
buffalo
skeletons
three
bleached
skeletons
seven
skulls
one
skin
entire
and
one
head
skin
in
addition
to
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
skins
and
skeletons
of
smaller
mammals
and
birds
on
reaching
miles
city
we
hastily
packed
and
shipped
our
collection
and
taking
the
calf
with
us
returned
at
once
to
washington
ii
the
hunt
on
september
i
arrived
at
miles
city
a
second
time
fully
equipped
for
a
protracted
hunt
for
buffalo
this
time
accompanied
only
by
harvey
brown
a
student
of
the
university
of
kansas
as
field
assistant
having
previously
engaged
three
cowboys
as
guides
and
hunters
irwin
boyd
james
mcnaney
and
russell
boyd
and
russell
were
in
miles
city
awaiting
my
arrival
and
mcnaney
joined
us
in
the
field
a
few
days
later
boyd
acted
as
my
foreman
during
the
entire
hunt
a
position
which
he
filled
to
my
entire
satisfaction
thanks
to
the
energy
and
of
the
officers
at
fort
keogh
of
which
cochran
was
then
in
command
our
transportation
camp
equipage
and
stores
were
furnished
without
an
hour
delay
we
purchased
two
months
supplies
of
commissary
stores
a
team
and
two
and
hired
three
more
horses
a
light
wagon
and
a
set
of
double
harness
each
of
the
cowboys
furnished
one
horse
so
that
in
our
outfit
we
had
ten
head
a
team
and
two
good
for
each
hunter
the
worst
feature
of
the
whole
question
of
subsistence
was
the
absolute
necessity
of
hauling
a
supply
of
grain
from
miles
city
into
the
heart
of
the
buffalo
country
for
our
ten
horses
for
such
work
as
they
had
to
encounter
it
was
necessary
to
feed
them
constantly
and
liberally
with
oats
in
order
to
keep
them
in
condition
to
do
their
work
we
took
with
us
pounds
of
oats
and
by
the
beginning
of
november
as
much
more
had
to
be
hauled
up
to
us
thirty
six
hours
after
our
arrival
in
miles
city
our
outfit
was
complete
and
we
crossed
the
yellowstone
and
started
up
the
sunday
creek
trail
we
had
from
fort
keogh
a
team
an
escort
of
four
men
in
charge
of
sergeant
bayliss
and
an
old
veteran
of
more
than
twenty
years
service
from
the
fifth
infantry
private
patrick
mccanna
who
was
detailed
to
act
as
cook
and
for
our
party
during
our
stay
in
the
field
on
september
we
reached
tow
ranch
the
on
big
dry
creek
erroneously
called
big
timber
creek
on
most
maps
of
montana
at
the
mouth
of
sand
creek
which
here
flows
into
it
from
the
southwest
this
point
is
said
to
be
miles
from
miles
city
here
we
received
our
freight
from
the
wagon
loaded
it
with
bleached
skeletons
and
skulls
of
buffalo
and
started
it
back
to
the
post
one
member
of
the
escort
private
west
who
was
then
on
two
months
furlough
elected
to
join
our
party
for
the
hunt
and
accordingly
remained
with
us
to
its
close
leaving
half
of
our
freight
stored
at
the
ranch
we
loaded
the
remainder
upon
our
own
wagon
and
started
up
sand
creek
illustration

of
the

for

montana
at
this
point
the
hunt
began
as
the
wagon
and
extra
horses
proceeded
up
the
sand
creek
trail
in
the
care
of
harvey
brown
the
three
cowboys
and
i
paired
off
and
while
two
hunted
through
the
country
along
the
south
side
of
the
creek
the
others
took
the
north
the
whole
of
the
country
bordering
sand
creek
quite
up
to
its
source
consists
of
rugged
hills
and
ridges
which
sometimes
rise
to
considerable
height
cut
between
by
great
yawning
ravines
and
hollows
such
as
persecuted
game
loves
to
seek
shelter
in
inasmuch
as
the
buffalo
we
were
in
search
of
had
been
seen
hiding
in
those
ravines
it
became
necessary
to
search
through
them
with
systematic
thoroughness
a
proceeding
which
was
very
wearing
upon
our
horses
along
the
south
side
of
sand
creek
near
its
source
the
divide
between
it
and
little
dry
creek
culminates
in
a
chain
of
high
buttes
whose
summits
bear
a
scanty
growth
of
stunted
pines
which
serve
to
make
them
conspicuous
landmarks
on
some
maps
these
insignificant
little
buttes
are
shown
as
mountains
under
the
name
of
piny
buttes
it
was
our
intention
to
go
to
the
head
of
sand
creek
and
beyond
in
case
buffaloes
were
not
found
earlier
immediately
westward
of
its
source
there
is
a
lofty
level
plateau
about
miles
square
which
by
common
consent
we
called
the
high
divide
it
is
the
highest
ground
anywhere
between
the
big
dry
and
the
yellowstone
and
is
the
starting
point
of
streams
that
run
northward
into
the
missouri
and
big
dry
eastward
into
sand
creek
and
the
little
dry
southward
into
porcupine
creek
and
the
yellowstone
and
westward
into
the
musselshell
on
three
sides
north
east
and
south
it
is
surrounded
by
wild
and
rugged
butte
country
and
its
sides
are
scored
by
intricate
systems
of
great
yawning
ravines
and
hollows
and
very
deep
and
bad
lands
of
the
worst
description
by
the
of
october
the
hunt
had
progressed
up
sand
creek
to
its
source
and
westward
across
the
high
divide
to
calf
creek
where
we
found
a
hole
of
wretchedly
bad
water
and
went
into
permanent
camp
we
considered
that
the
spot
we
selected
would
serve
us
as
a
key
to
the
promising
country
that
lay
on
three
sides
of
it
and
our
surmise
that
the
buffalo
were
in
the
habit
of
hiding
in
the
heads
of
those
great
ravines
around
the
high
divide
soon
proved
to
be
correct
our
camp
at
the
head
of
calf
creek
was
about
miles
east
of
the
musselshell
river
miles
south
of
the
missouri
and
about
miles
from
miles
city
as
the
trail
ran
four
miles
north
of
us
also
on
calf
creek
was
the
line
camp
of
the
ranch
owned
by
conrad
and
miles
east
near
the
head
of
sand
creek
was
the
line
camp
of
the
ranch
owned
by
newman
at
each
of
these
camps
there
were
generally
from
two
to
four
cowboys
from
all
these
gentlemen
we
received
the
utmost
courtesy
and
hospitality
on
all
occasions
and
all
the
information
in
regard
to
buffalo
which
it
was
in
their
power
to
give
on
many
occasions
they
rendered
us
valuable
assistance
which
is
hereby
gratefully
acknowledged
we
saw
no
buffalo
nor
any
signs
of
any
until
october
on
that
day
while
russell
was
escorting
our
second
load
of
freight
across
the
high
divide
he
discovered
a
band
of
seven
buffaloes
lying
in
the
head
of
a
deep
ravine
he
fired
upon
them
but
killed
none
and
when
they
dashed
away
he
gave
chase
and
followed
them
or
miles
being
mounted
on
a
tired
horse
which
was
unequal
to
the
demands
of
the
chase
he
was
finally
distanced
by
the
herd
which
took
a
straight
course
and
ran
due
south
as
it
was
then
nearly
night
nothing
further
could
be
done
that
day
except
to
prepare
for
a
vigorous
chase
on
the
morrow
everything
was
got
in
perfect
readiness
for
an
early
start
and
by
daybreak
the
following
morning
the
three
cowboys
and
the
writer
were
mounted
on
our
best
horses
and
on
our
way
through
the
bad
lands
to
take
up
the
trail
of
the
seven
buffaloes
shortly
after
sunrise
we
found
the
trail
not
far
from
the
head
of
calf
creek
and
followed
it
due
south
we
left
the
rugged
butte
region
behind
us
and
entered
a
tract
of
country
quite
unlike
anything
we
had
found
before
it
was
composed
of
a
succession
of
rolling
hills
and
deep
hollows
smooth
enough
on
the
surface
to
all
appearances
but
like
a
desert
of
to
traverse
the
dry
soil
was
loose
and
crumbly
like
loose
ashes
or
scoriæ
and
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
sank
into
it
to
the
fetlocks
at
every
step
but
there
was
another
feature
which
was
still
worse
the
whole
surface
of
the
ground
was
cracked
and
seamed
with
a
perfect
of
great
cracks
into
which
our
horses
stepped
every
yard
or
so
and
sank
down
still
farther
with
many
a
tiresome
wrench
of
the
joints
it
was
terrible
ground
to
go
over
to
make
it
as
bad
as
possible
a
thick
growth
of
or
else
was
everywhere
present
for
the
horses
to
struggle
through
and
when
it
came
to
dragging
a
loaded
wagon
across
that
stretch
of
bad
grounds
or
gumbo
ground
as
it
was
called
it
was
killing
work
but
in
spite
of
the
character
of
this
ground
in
one
way
it
was
a
benefit
to
us
owing
to
its
looseness
on
the
surface
we
were
able
to
track
the
buffaloes
through
it
with
the
greatest
ease
whereas
on
any
other
ground
in
that
country
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
we
followed
the
trail
due
south
for
about
miles
which
brought
us
to
the
head
of
a
small
stream
called
taylor
creek
here
the
bad
grounds
ended
and
in
the
grassy
country
which
lay
beyond
tracking
was
almost
impossible
just
at
noon
we
rode
to
a
high
point
and
on
scanning
the
hills
and
hollows
with
the
binocular
discovered
the
buffaloes
lying
at
rest
on
the
level
top
of
a
small
butte
miles
away
the
original
bunch
of
seven
had
been
joined
by
an
equal
number
we
crept
up
to
within
yards
of
the
buffaloes
which
was
as
close
as
we
could
go
fired
a
volley
at
them
just
as
they
lay
and
did
not
even
kill
a
calf
instantly
they
sprang
up
and
dashed
away
at
astonishing
speed
heading
straight
for
the
sheltering
ravines
around
the
high
divide
we
had
a
most
exciting
and
likewise
dangerous
chase
after
the
herd
through
a
vast
town
with
holes
just
right
for
a
running
horse
to
thrust
a
leg
in
up
to
the
knee
and
snap
it
off
like
a
and
across
fearfully
wide
gullies
that
either
had
to
be
leaped
or
fallen
into
mcnaney
killed
a
fine
old
bull
and
a
beautiful
two
year
old
or
spike
bull
out
of
this
herd
while
i
managed
to
kill
a
cow
and
another
large
old
bull
making
four
for
that
day
all
told
this
herd
of
fourteen
head
was
the
largest
that
we
saw
during
the
entire
hunt
two
days
later
when
we
were
on
the
spot
with
the
wagon
to
skin
our
game
and
haul
in
the
hides
four
more
buffaloes
were
discovered
within
miles
of
us
and
while
i
worked
on
one
of
the
large
bull
skins
to
save
it
from
spoiling
the
cowboys
went
after
the
buffalo
and
by
a
really
brilliant
exploit
killed
them
all
the
first
one
to
fall
was
an
old
cow
which
was
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
chase
the
next
was
an
old
bull
who
was
brought
down
about
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
first
attack
then
miles
farther
on
a
yearling
calf
was
killed
the
fourth
buffalo
an
immense
old
bull
was
chased
fully
miles
before
he
was
finally
brought
down
the
largest
bull
fell
about
miles
from
our
temporary
camp
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
our
permanent
camp
lay
and
at
about
in
the
afternoon
there
not
being
time
enough
in
which
to
skin
him
completely
and
reach
our
rendezvous
before
dark
mcnaney
and
boyd
dressed
the
carcass
to
preserve
the
meat
partly
skinned
the
legs
and
came
to
camp
as
early
as
possible
the
next
morning
we
drove
to
the
carcass
with
the
wagon
to
prepare
both
skin
and
skeleton
and
haul
them
in
when
we
reached
it
we
found
that
during
the
night
a
gang
of
indians
had
robbed
us
of
our
spoil
they
had
stolen
the
skin
and
all
the
eatable
meat
broken
up
the
to
get
at
the
marrow
and
even
cut
out
the
tongue
and
to
injury
the
skulking
thieves
had
added
insult
through
laziness
they
had
left
the
head
unskinned
but
on
one
side
of
it
they
had
smeared
the
hair
with
red
the
other
side
they
had
daubed
with
yellow
and
around
the
base
of
one
horn
they
had
tied
a
strip
of
red
flannel
as
a
signal
of
defiance
of
course
they
had
left
for
parts
unknown
and
we
never
saw
any
signs
of
them
afterward
the
gang
visited
the
ranch
a
few
days
later
so
we
learned
subsequently
it
was
then
composed
of
eleven
braves
who
claimed
to
be
assinniboines
and
were
therefore
believed
to
be
piegans
the
most
notorious
horse
and
cattle
thieves
in
the
northwest
on
october
russell
ran
down
in
a
fair
chase
a
fine
bull
buffalo
and
killed
him
in
the
rough
country
bordering
the
high
divide
on
the
south
this
was
the
ninth
specimen
on
the
we
made
an
other
trip
with
the
wagon
to
the
buffalo
buttes
as
for
the
sake
of
convenience
we
had
named
the
group
of
buttes
near
which
eight
head
had
already
been
taken
while
brown
and
i
were
getting
the
wagon
across
the
bad
grounds
mcnaney
and
boyd
discovered
a
solitary
bull
buffalo
feeding
in
a
ravine
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
our
intended
camping
place
and
the
former
stalked
him
and
killed
him
at
long
range
the
buffalo
had
all
been
attracted
to
that
locality
by
some
springs
which
lay
between
two
groups
of
hills
and
which
was
the
only
water
within
a
radius
of
about
miles
in
addition
to
water
the
grass
around
the
buffalo
buttes
was
most
excellent
during
all
this
time
we
shot
antelope
and
coyotes
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
and
preserved
the
skins
and
skeletons
of
the
finest
until
we
had
obtained
a
very
fine
series
of
both
at
this
season
the
pelts
of
these
animals
were
in
the
finest
possible
condition
the
hair
having
attained
its
maximum
length
and
density
and
being
quite
new
had
lost
none
of
its
brightness
of
color
either
by
wear
or
the
action
of
the
weather
along
sand
creek
and
all
around
the
high
divide
antelope
were
moderately
plentiful
but
really
scarce
in
comparison
with
their
former
abundance
so
much
so
that
had
we
been
inclined
to
slaughter
we
could
have
killed
a
hundred
head
or
more
instead
of
the
twenty
that
we
shot
as
specimens
and
for
their
flesh
we
have
it
to
say
that
from
first
to
last
not
an
antelope
was
killed
which
was
not
made
use
of
to
the
fullest
extent
on
the
of
october
boyd
and
i
discovered
a
buffalo
cow
and
yearling
calf
in
the
ravines
north
of
the
high
divide
within
miles
of
our
camp
and
killed
them
both
the
next
day
private
west
arrived
with
a
six
mule
team
from
fort
keogh
in
charge
of
corporal
clafer
and
three
men
this
wagon
brought
us
another
pounds
of
oats
and
various
commissary
stores
when
it
started
back
on
november
we
sent
by
it
all
the
skins
and
skeletons
of
buffalo
antelope
which
we
had
collected
up
to
that
date
which
made
a
heavy
load
for
the
six
mules
on
this
same
day
mcnaney
killed
two
young
cow
buffaloes
in
the
bad
lands
south
of
the
high
divide
which
brought
our
total
number
up
to
fourteen
on
the
night
of
the
the
weather
turned
very
cold
and
on
the
day
following
we
experienced
our
first
by
that
time
the
water
in
the
hole
which
up
to
that
time
had
supplied
our
camp
became
so
thick
with
mud
and
filth
that
it
was
unendurable
and
having
discovered
a
fine
pool
of
pure
water
in
the
bottom
of
a
little
cañon
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
high
divide
we
moved
to
it
forthwith
it
was
really
the
upper
spring
of
the
main
fork
of
the
big
porcupine
and
a
finer
situation
for
a
camp
does
not
exist
in
that
whole
region
the
spot
which
nature
made
for
us
was
sheltered
on
all
sides
by
the
high
walls
of
the
cañon
within
easy
reach
of
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
good
water
and
also
within
reach
of
a
fair
supply
of
dry
which
we
found
half
a
mile
below
this
became
our
last
permanent
camp
and
its
advantages
made
up
for
the
barrenness
and
discomfort
of
our
camp
on
calf
creek
immediately
south
of
us
and
miles
distant
there
rose
a
lofty
conical
butte
about
feet
high
which
forms
a
very
conspicuous
landmark
from
the
south
we
were
told
that
it
was
visible
from
miles
down
the
porcupine
strange
to
say
this
valuable
landmark
was
without
a
name
so
far
as
we
could
learn
so
for
our
own
convenience
we
christened
it
smithsonian
butte
the
two
buffalo
cows
that
mcnaney
killed
just
before
we
moved
our
camp
seemed
to
be
the
last
in
the
country
for
during
the
following
week
we
scouted
for
miles
in
three
directions
north
east
and
south
without
finding
as
much
as
a
at
last
we
decided
to
go
away
and
give
that
country
absolute
quiet
for
a
week
in
the
hope
that
some
more
buffalo
would
come
into
it
leaving
mccanna
and
west
to
take
care
of
the
camp
we
loaded
a
small
assortment
of
general
equipage
into
the
wagon
and
pulled
about
miles
due
west
to
the
musselshell
river
we
found
a
fine
stream
of
clear
water
flowing
over
sand
and
pebbles
with
heavy
cottonwood
timber
and
thick
copses
of
willow
along
its
banks
which
afforded
cover
for
deer
in
the
rugged
brakes
which
led
from
the
level
river
bottom
into
a
labyrinth
of
ravines
and
gullies
ridges
and
up
to
the
level
of
the
high
plateau
above
we
found
a
scanty
growth
of
stunted
cedars
and
pines
which
once
sheltered
great
numbers
of
mule
deer
elk
and
bear
now
however
few
remain
and
these
are
very
hard
to
find
even
when
found
the
deer
are
nearly
always
young
although
we
killed
five
mule
deer
and
five
we
did
not
kill
even
one
fine
buck
and
the
only
one
we
saw
on
the
whole
trip
was
a
long
distance
off
we
saw
fresh
tracks
of
elk
and
also
grizzly
bear
but
our
most
vigorous
efforts
to
discover
the
animals
themselves
always
ended
in
disappointment
the
many
bleaching
skulls
and
antlers
of
elk
and
deer
which
we
found
everywhere
we
went
afforded
proof
of
what
that
country
had
been
as
a
home
for
wild
animals
only
a
few
years
ago
we
were
not
a
little
surprised
at
finding
the
fleshless
carcasses
of
three
head
of
cattle
that
had
been
killed
and
eaten
by
bears
within
a
few
months
in
addition
to
ten
deer
we
shot
three
wild
geese
seven
grouse
eleven
sage
grouse
nine
bohemian
waxwings
and
a
magpie
for
their
skeletons
we
made
one
trip
of
several
miles
up
the
musselshell
and
another
due
west
almost
to
the
bull
mountains
but
no
signs
of
buffalo
were
found
the
weather
at
this
time
was
quite
cold
the
thermometer
registering
degrees
below
zero
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
without
shelter
and
had
to
bivouac
in
the
open
we
were
generally
speaking
quite
comfortable
having
found
no
buffalo
by
the
we
felt
convinced
that
we
ought
to
return
to
our
permanent
camp
and
did
so
on
that
day
having
brought
back
nearly
half
a
of
specimens
in
the
flesh
or
half
skinned
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
remain
at
camp
all
the
next
day
while
i
did
so
mcnaney
and
boyd
rode
over
to
the
buffalo
buttes
found
four
fine
old
buffalo
cows
and
after
a
hard
chase
killed
them
all
under
the
circumstances
this
was
the
most
brilliant
piece
of
work
of
the
entire
hunt
as
the
four
cows
dashed
past
the
hunters
at
the
buffalo
buttes
heading
for
the
high
divide
fully
miles
distant
mcnaney
killed
one
cow
and
two
others
went
off
wounded
of
course
the
cowboys
gave
chase
about
miles
from
the
one
of
the
wounded
cows
left
her
companions
was
headed
off
by
boyd
and
killed
about
miles
beyond
that
one
mcnaney
overhauled
the
third
cow
and
killed
her
but
the
fourth
one
got
away
for
a
short
time
while
mcnaney
skinned
the
third
cow
and
dressed
the
carcass
to
preserve
the
meat
boyd
took
their
now
thoroughly
exhausted
horses
to
camp
and
procured
fresh
mounts
on
returning
to
mcnaney
they
set
out
in
pursuit
of
the
fourth
cow
chased
her
across
the
high
divide
within
a
mile
or
so
of
our
camp
and
into
the
ravines
on
the
northern
slope
where
she
was
killed
she
met
her
death
nearly
if
not
quite
miles
from
the
spot
where
the
first
one
fell
the
death
of
these
four
cows
brought
our
number
of
buffaloes
up
to
eighteen
and
made
us
think
about
the
possibilities
of
getting
thirty
as
we
were
proceeding
to
the
buffalo
buttes
on
the
day
after
the
kill
to
gather
in
the
spoil
brown
and
i
taking
charge
of
the
wagon
mcnaney
and
boyd
went
ahead
in
order
to
hunt
when
within
about
miles
of
the
buttes
we
came
unexpectedly
upon
our
companions
down
in
a
hollow
busily
engaged
in
skinning
another
old
cow
which
they
had
discovered
traveling
across
the
bad
grounds
waylaid
and
killed
we
camped
that
night
on
our
old
ground
at
the
buffalo
buttes
and
although
we
all
desired
to
remain
a
day
or
two
and
hunt
for
more
buffalo
the
peculiar
appearance
of
the
sky
in
the
northwest
and
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
warned
us
that
a
change
of
weather
was
imminent
accordingly
the
following
morning
we
decided
without
hesitation
that
it
was
best
to
get
back
to
camp
that
day
and
it
soon
proved
very
fortunate
for
us
that
we
so
decided
feeling
that
by
reason
of
my
work
on
the
specimens
i
had
been
deprived
of
a
fair
share
of
the
chase
i
arranged
for
boyd
to
accompany
the
wagon
on
the
return
trip
that
i
might
hunt
through
the
bad
lands
west
of
the
buffalo
buttes
which
i
felt
must
contain
some
buffalo
russell
went
northeast
and
mcnaney
accompanied
me
about
miles
from
our
late
camp
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
fine
old
solitary
bull
feeding
in
a
hollow
between
two
high
and
precipitous
ridges
after
a
short
but
sharp
chase
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
fair
shot
at
him
and
killed
him
with
a
ball
which
broke
his
left
humerus
and
passed
into
his
lungs
he
was
the
only
large
bull
killed
on
the
entire
trip
by
a
single
shot
he
proved
to
be
a
very
fine
specimen
measuring
feet
inches
in
height
at
the
shoulders
the
wagon
was
overtaken
and
called
back
to
get
the
skin
and
while
it
was
coming
i
took
a
complete
series
of
measurements
and
sketches
of
him
as
he
lay
although
we
removed
the
skin
very
quickly
and
lost
no
time
in
again
starting
the
wagon
to
our
permanent
camp
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
death
of
our
twentieth
buffalo
which
occurred
on
november
precisely
two
months
from
the
date
of
our
leaving
washington
to
collect
twenty
buffalo
it
possible
caused
us
all
to
be
caught
in
a
which
burst
upon
us
from
the
northwest
the
wagon
had
to
be
abandoned
about
miles
from
camp
in
the
bad
lands
brown
packed
the
bedding
on
one
of
the
horses
and
rode
the
other
he
and
boyd
reaching
camp
about
that
night
in
a
blinding
of
coarse
the
skins
in
the
wagon
were
treated
with
preservatives
and
covered
up
it
proved
to
be
over
a
week
that
the
wagon
and
its
load
had
to
remain
thus
abandoned
before
it
was
possible
to
get
to
it
and
bring
it
to
camp
and
even
then
the
task
was
one
of
great
difficulty
in
this
connection
i
can
not
refrain
from
recording
the
fact
that
the
services
rendered
by
harvey
brown
on
all
such
trying
occasions
as
the
above
were
invaluable
he
displayed
the
utmost
zeal
and
intelligence
not
only
in
the
more
agreeable
kinds
of
work
and
sport
incident
to
the
hunt
but
also
in
the
disagreeable
drudgery
such
as
and
working
on
specimens
in
bitter
cold
weather
the
storm
which
set
in
on
the
soon
developed
into
a
regular
blizzard
a
fierce
and
bitter
cold
wind
swept
down
from
the
northwest
driving
the
snow
before
it
in
blinding
gusts
had
our
camp
been
poorly
sheltered
we
would
have
suffered
but
at
it
was
we
were
fairly
comfortable
having
thus
completed
our
task
of
getting
twenty
buffaloes
we
were
anxious
to
get
out
of
that
fearful
country
before
we
should
get
caught
in
serious
difficulties
with
the
weather
and
it
was
arranged
that
private
west
should
ride
to
fort
keogh
as
soon
as
possible
with
a
request
for
transportation
by
the
third
day
november
the
storm
had
abated
sufficiently
that
private
west
declared
his
willingness
to
start
it
was
a
little
risky
but
as
he
was
to
make
only
miles
the
first
day
and
stop
at
the
camp
on
sand
creek
it
was
thought
safe
to
let
him
go
he
dressed
himself
warmly
took
my
revolver
in
order
not
to
be
hampered
with
a
rifle
and
set
out
the
next
day
was
clear
and
fine
and
we
remarked
it
as
an
assurance
of
west
safety
during
his
ride
from
sand
creek
to
the
ranch
his
second
the
distance
was
about
miles
through
bad
lands
all
the
way
and
it
was
the
only
portion
of
the
route
which
caused
me
anxiety
for
our
courier
safety
the
snow
on
the
levels
was
less
than
inches
deep
the
most
of
it
having
been
blown
into
drifts
and
hollows
but
although
the
coulées
were
all
filled
level
to
the
top
our
courier
was
a
man
of
experience
and
would
know
how
to
avoid
them
the
day
of
november
was
the
most
severe
day
of
the
storm
the
mercury
in
our
sheltered
cañon
sinking
to
degrees
we
had
hoped
to
kill
at
least
five
more
buffaloes
by
the
time
private
west
should
arrive
with
the
wagons
but
when
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
storm
had
spent
itself
the
snow
was
so
deep
that
hunting
was
totally
impossible
save
in
the
vicinity
of
camp
where
there
was
nothing
to
kill
we
expected
the
wagons
by
the
of
december
but
they
did
not
come
that
day
nor
within
the
next
three
by
the
the
snow
had
melted
off
sufficiently
that
a
buffalo
hunt
was
once
more
possible
and
mcnaney
and
i
decided
to
make
a
final
trip
to
the
buffalo
buttes
the
state
of
the
ground
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
go
there
and
return
the
same
day
so
we
took
a
and
arranged
to
camp
out
when
a
little
over
to
our
old
rendezvous
we
came
upon
three
buffaloes
in
the
bad
grounds
one
of
which
was
an
enormous
old
bull
the
next
largest
was
an
adult
cow
and
the
third
a
heifer
mcnaney
promptly
knocked
down
the
old
cow
while
i
devoted
my
attention
to
the
bull
but
she
presently
got
up
and
made
off
unnoticed
at
the
precise
moment
mcnaney
was
absorbed
in
watching
my
efforts
to
bring
down
the
old
bull
after
a
short
chase
my
horse
carried
me
alongside
my
buffalo
and
as
he
turned
toward
me
i
gave
him
a
shot
through
the
shoulder
breaking
the
fore
leg
and
bringing
him
promptly
to
the
ground
i
then
turned
immediately
to
pursue
the
young
cow
but
by
that
time
she
had
got
on
the
farther
side
of
a
deep
gully
which
was
filled
with
snow
and
by
the
time
i
got
my
horse
safely
across
she
had
distanced
me
i
then
rode
back
to
the
old
bull
when
he
saw
me
coming
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
ran
a
short
distance
but
was
easily
overtaken
he
then
stood
at
bay
and
halting
within
yards
of
him
i
enjoyed
the
rare
opportunity
of
studying
a
live
bull
buffalo
of
the
largest
size
on
foot
on
his
native
heath
i
even
made
an
outline
sketch
of
him
in
my
having
studied
his
form
and
outlines
as
much
as
was
really
necessary
i
gave
him
a
final
shot
through
the
lungs
which
soon
ended
his
career
this
was
a
truly
magnificent
specimen
in
every
respect
he
was
a
bull
about
eleven
years
old
much
larger
every
way
than
any
of
the
others
we
collected
his
height
at
the
shoulder
was
feet
inches
perpendicular
or
inches
more
than
the
next
largest
of
our
collection
his
hair
was
in
remarkably
fine
condition
being
long
fine
thick
and
well
colored
the
hair
in
his
frontlet
is
inches
in
length
and
the
thick
coat
of
shaggy
tufts
which
covered
his
neck
and
shoulders
measured
inches
his
girth
behind
the
fore
leg
was
feet
inches
and
his
weight
was
estimated
at
pounds

the

in
the

reproduced
from
the
by
permission
of
the
publishers
i
was
delighted
with
our
remarkably
good
fortune
in
securing
such
a
prize
for
owing
to
the
rapidity
with
which
the
large
buffaloes
are
being
found
and
killed
off
these
days
i
had
not
hoped
to
capture
a
really
old
individual
nearly
every
adult
bull
we
took
carried
old
bullets
in
his
body
and
from
this
one
we
took
four
of
various
sizes
that
had
been
fired
into
him
on
various
occasions
one
was
found
sticking
fast
in
one
of
the
lumbar
vertebræ
note
this
specimen
is
now
the
commanding
figure
of
the
group
of
buffalo
which
has
recently
been
placed
on
exhibition
in
the
museum
after
a
chase
of
several
miles
mcnaney
finally
overhauled
his
cow
and
killed
her
which
brought
the
number
of
buffaloes
taken
on
the
fall
hunt
up
to
we
spent
the
night
at
the
buffalo
buttes
and
returned
to
camp
the
next
day
neither
on
that
day
nor
the
one
following
did
the
wagons
arrive
and
on
the
evening
of
the
we
learned
from
the
cowboys
of
the
camp
on
sand
creek
that
our
courier
private
west
had
not
been
seen
or
heard
from
since
he
left
their
camp
on
november
and
evidently
had
got
lost
and
frozen
to
death
in
the
bad
lands
the
next
day
we
started
out
to
search
for
private
west
or
news
of
him
and
spent
the
night
with
brodhurst
and
andrews
at
their
camp
on
sand
creek
on
the
mcnaney
and
i
hunted
through
the
bad
lands
over
the
course
our
courier
should
have
taken
while
russell
and
brodhurst
looked
through
the
country
around
the
head
of
the
little
dry
when
mcnaney
and
i
reached
the
ranch
that
night
we
were
greatly
rejoiced
at
finding
that
west
was
alive
although
badly
and
in
fort
keogh
it
appears
that
instead
of
riding
due
east
to
the
ranch
he
lost
his
way
in
the
bad
lands
where
the
buttes
all
look
alike
when
covered
with
snow
and
rode
southwest
it
is
at
all
times
an
easy
matter
for
even
a
cowboy
to
get
lost
in
montana
if
the
country
is
new
to
him
and
when
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
the
difficulty
of
finding
one
way
is
increased
tenfold
there
is
not
only
the
danger
of
losing
one
way
but
the
still
greater
danger
of
getting
ingulfed
in
a
deep
coulée
full
of
loose
snow
which
may
easily
cause
both
horse
and
rider
to
perish
miserably
even
the
most
experienced
riders
sometimes
ride
into
coulées
which
are
level
full
of
snow
and
hidden
from
sight
private
west
experience
was
a
terrible
one
and
also
a
wonderful
case
of
it
shows
what
a
man
with
a
cool
head
and
plenty
of
grit
can
go
through
and
live
when
he
left
us
he
wore
two
undershirts
a
heavy
blanket
shirt
a
soldier
blouse
and
overcoat
two
pairs
of
drawers
a
pair
of
soldier
woolen
trousers
and
a
pair
of
overalls
on
his
feet
he
wore
three
pairs
of
socks
a
pair
of
with
canvas
leggins
and
he
started
with
his
feet
tied
up
in
burlaps
his
head
and
hands
were
also
well
protected
he
carried
a
revolver
but
by
a
great
oversight
only
six
matches
when
he
left
the
camp
instead
of
going
due
east
toward
the
ranch
he
swung
around
and
went
southwest
clear
around
the
head
of
the
little
dry
and
finally
struck
the
porcupine
south
of
our
camp
the
first
night
out
he
made
a
fire
with
and
kept
it
going
all
night
the
second
night
he
also
had
a
fire
but
it
took
his
last
match
to
make
it
during
the
first
three
days
he
had
no
food
but
on
the
fourth
he
shot
a
with
his
revolver
and
ate
it
raw
this
effort
however
cost
him
his
last
cartridge
through
hard
work
and
lack
of
food
his
pony
presently
gave
out
and
necessitated
long
and
frequent
stops
for
rest
west
feet
threatened
to
freeze
and
he
cut
off
the
skirts
of
his
overcoat
to
wrap
them
with
in
place
of
the
gunny
sacking
that
had
been
worn
to
rags
being
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
he
slept
by
snatches
in
the
warmest
part
of
the
day
while
resting
his
horse
on
the
day
he
began
to
despair
of
succor
although
he
still
toiled
southward
through
the
bad
lands
toward
the
yellowstone
where
people
lived
on
the
envelopes
which
contained
my
letters
he
kept
a
diary
of
his
wanderings
which
could
tell
his
story
when
the
cowboys
would
find
his
body
on
the
spring
on
the
afternoon
of
the
sixth
day
he
found
a
trail
and
followed
it
until
nearly
night
when
he
came
to
cree
sheep
ranch
and
found
the
solitary
ranchman
at
home
the
frontiersman
gave
the
starving
wanderers
man
and
horse
such
a
welcome
as
they
stood
in
need
of
west
solemnly
declares
that
in
hours
he
ate
a
whole
sheep
after
two
or
three
days
of
rest
and
feeding
both
horse
and
rider
were
able
to
go
on
and
in
course
of
time
reached
fort
keogh
without
the
loss
of
a
single
day
colonel
gibson
started
three
teams
and
an
escort
up
to
us
and
notwithstanding
his
terrible
experience
west
had
the
pluck
to
accompany
them
as
guide
his
arrival
among
us
once
more
was
like
the
dead
coming
to
life
again
the
train
reached
our
camp
on
the
and
on
the
we
pulled
out
for
miles
city
loaded
to
the
with
specimens
forage
and
camp
plunder
from
our
camp
down
to
the
ranch
at
the
mouth
of
sand
creek
the
trail
was
in
a
terrible
condition
but
thanks
to
the
skill
and
judgment
of
the
ed
haskins
and
his
two
drivers
who
also
knew
their
business
well
we
got
safely
and
in
good
time
over
the
dangerous
part
of
our
road
whenever
our
own
tired
and
overloaded
team
got
stuck
in
the
mud
or
gave
out
there
was
always
a
pair
of
mules
ready
to
hitch
on
and
help
us
out
as
a
haskins
was
a
perfect
model
skillful
pushing
and
very
obliging
from
the
ranch
to
miles
city
the
trail
was
in
fine
condition
and
we
went
in
as
rapidly
as
possible
fearing
to
be
caught
in
the
which
threatened
us
all
the
way
in
we
reached
miles
city
on
december
with
our
collection
complete
and
in
fine
condition
and
the
next
day
a
set
in
which
lasted
until
the
and
resulted
in
over
a
foot
of
snow
the
ice
running
in
the
yellowstone
stopped
all
the
and
it
was
with
good
reason
that
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
the
successful
termination
of
our
hunt
at
that
particular
time
without
loss
of
time
brown
and
i
packed
our
collection
which
tilled
large
cases
turned
in
our
equipage
at
fort
keogh
sold
our
horses
and
started
on
our
homeward
journey
in
due
course
of
time
the
collection
reached
the
museum
in
good
condition
and
a
series
of
the
best
specimens
it
contains
has
already
been
mounted
at
this
point
it
is
proper
to
acknowledge
our
great
indebtedness
to
the
secretary
of
war
for
the
timely
of
the
war
department
which
rendered
the
expedition
possible
our
thanks
are
due
to
the
officers
who
were
successively
in
command
at
fort
keogh
during
our
work
john
wilkins
george
gibson
and
lieut
cochran
and
their
various
staff
officers
particularly
lieut
thompson
quartermaster
and
lieut
bailey
adjutant
it
is
due
these
officers
to
state
that
everything
we
asked
for
was
cheerfully
granted
with
a
degree
of
promptness
which
contributed
very
greatly
to
the
success
of
the
hunt
and
lightened
its
labors
very
materially
i
have
already
acknowledged
our
indebtedness
to
the
officers
of
the
pennsylvania
the
chicago
milwaukee
and
paul
and
northern
pacific
railways
for
the
courtesies
so
liberally
extended
in
our
emergency
i
take
pleasure
in
adding
that
all
the
officers
and
employés
of
the
northern
pacific
railway
with
whom
we
had
any
relations
particularly
fee
general
passenger
and
ticket
agent
treated
our
party
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
liberality
throughout
the
trip
we
are
in
like
manner
indebted
to
the
officers
of
the
chicago
milwaukee
and
paul
railway
for
valuable
privileges
granted
with
the
utmost
cordiality
our
thanks
are
also
due
to
merrill
and
to
henry
phillips
of
the
phillips
land
and
cattle
company
on
little
dry
creek
for
valuable
information
at
a
critical
moment
and
to
the
latter
for
hospitality
and
assistance
in
various
ways
at
times
when
both
were
keenly
appreciated
counting
the
specimens
taken
in
the
spring
our
total
catch
of
buffalo
amounted
to
head
and
constituted
as
complete
and
fine
a
series
as
could
be
wished
for
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
in
size
and
general
quality
of
pelage
the
adult
bull
and
cow
selected
and
mounted
for
our
museum
group
are
not
to
be
surpassed
even
if
they
are
ever
equaled
by
others

the

appeals
most
strongly

of
prickly
pear
the
pool
is
clear
and
tranquil
about
its
edges
is
a
white
deposit
of
alkali
these
are
the
scenic
accessories
of
the
buffalo
group
but
they
have
an
interest
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
buffaloes
themselves
for
they
form
really
and
literally
a
genuine
bit
of
the
west
the
homesick
montana
cowboy
far
from
his
wild
haunts
can
here
gaze
upon
his
native
sod
again
for
the
sod
the
earth
that
forms
the
face
of
the
bank
the
and
all
were
brought
from
montana
all
except
the
pool
the
pool
is
a
glassy
delusion
and
very
perfect
in
its
way
one
sees
a
plant
growing
beneath
the
water
and
in
the
soft
oozy
bottom
near
the
edge
are
the
deep
prints
made
by
the
fore
feet
of
a
big
buffalo
bull
about
the
soft
moist
earth
around
the
pool
and
in
the
buffalo
trail
are
the
of
the
buffalo
that
have
tramped
around
the
pool
some
of
those
nearest
the
edge
having
filled
with
water
the
six
buffaloes
the
group
comprises
six
buffaloes
in
front
of
the
pool
as
if
just
going
to
drink
is
the
huge
buffalo
bull
the
giant
of
his
race
the
last
one
that
was
secured
by
the
smithsonian
party
in
and
the
one
that
is
believed
to
be
the
largest
specimen
of
which
there
is
authentic
record
near
by
is
a
cow
eight
years
old
a
creature
that
would
be
considered
of
great
dimensions
in
any
other
company
than
that
of
the
big
bull
near
the
cow
is
a
suckling
calf
four
months
old
upon
the
top
of
the
mound
is
a
spike
bull
two
and
a
half
years
old
descending
the
mound
away
from
the
pool
is
a
young
cow
three
years
old
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
male
calf
a
year
and
a
half
old
all
the
members
of
the
group
are
disposed
in
natural
attitudes
the
young
cow
is
snuffing
at
a
bunch
of
tall
grass
the
old
bull
and
cow
are
turning
their
heads
in
the
same
direction
apparently
as
if
alarmed
by
something
approaching
the
others
having
slaked
their
thirst
appear
to
be
moving
contentedly
away
the
four
months
old
calf
was
captured
alive
and
brought
to
this
city
it
lived
for
some
days
in
the
smithsonian
grounds
but
pined
for
its
prairie
home
and
finally
died
it
is
around
the
great
bull
that
the
romance
and
main
interest
of
the
group
centers
it
seemed
as
if
providence
had
ordained
that
this
splendid
animal
perfect
in
limb
noble
in
size
should
be
saved
to
serve
as
a
monument
to
the
greatness
of
his
race
that
once
roamed
the
prairies
in
myriads
bullets
found
in
his
body
showed
that
he
had
been
chased
and
hunted
before
but
fate
preserved
him
for
the
immortality
of
a
museum
exhibit
his
vertical
height
at
the
shoulders
is
feet
inches
the
thick
hair
adds
enough
to
his
height
to
make
it
full
feet
the
length
of
his
head
and
body
is
feet
inches
his
girth
feet
inches
and
his
weight
is
or
was
about
pounds
the
taxidermist
object
lessons
this
group
with
its
accessories
is
in
point
of
size
about
the
biggest
thing
ever
attempted
by
a
taxidermist
it
was
mounted
by
hornaday
assisted
by
palmer
and
forney
it
represents
a
new
departure
in
mounting
specimens
for
museums
generally
such
specimens
have
been
mounted
singly
upon
a
flat
surface
the
american
mammals
collected
by
hornaday
will
be
mounted
in
a
manner
that
will
make
each
piece
or
group
an
object
lesson
telling
something
of
the
history
and
the
habits
of
the
animal
the
first
group
produced
as
one
of
the
results
of
the
montana
hunt
comprised
three
coyotes
two
of
them
are
struggling
and
one
might
almost
say
snarling
over
a
bone
they
do
not
stand
on
a
painted
board
but
on
a
little
patch
of
soil
two
other
groups
designed
by
hornaday
and
executed
by
william
palmer
are
about
to
be
placed
in
the
museum
one
of
these
represents
a
family
of
they
are
disposed
about
a
mound
one
sits
on
its
haunches
eating
others
are
running
about
across
the
mouth
of
the
burrow
just
ready
to
disappear
into
it
is
another
one
startled
for
the
moment
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
little
burrowing
owl
that
has
alighted
on
one
side
of
the
burrow
the
owl
and
the
dog
are
good
friends
and
live
together
in
the
same
burrow
but
there
appears
to
be
strained
relations
between
the
two

the
