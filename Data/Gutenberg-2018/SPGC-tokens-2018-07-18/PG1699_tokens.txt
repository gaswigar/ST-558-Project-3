the
vanished
messenger
by

oppenheim
chapter
i
there
were
very
few
people
upon
platform
number
of
liverpool
street
station
at
a
quarter
to
nine
on
the
evening
of
april
possibly
because
the
platform
in
question
is
one
of
the
most
remote
and
least
used
in
the
great
terminus
the
however
was
there
himself
with
an
inspector
in
attendance
a
dark
man
wearing
a
long
travelling
ulster
and
a
homburg
hat
and
carrying
in
his
hand
a
brown
leather
across
which
was
painted
in
black
letters
the
name
john
dunster
was
standing
a
few
yards
away
smoking
a
long
cigar
and
to
all
appearance
absorbed
in
studying
the
advertisements
which
decorated
the
grimy
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
single
track
a
couple
of
porters
were
seated
upon
a
barrow
which
contained
one
solitary
portmanteau
there
were
no
signs
of
other
passengers
no
other
luggage
as
a
matter
of
fact
according
to
the
no
train
was
due
to
leave
the
station
or
to
arrive
at
it
on
this
particular
platform
for
several
hours
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
the
wooden
barrier
was
thrust
back
and
a
porter
with
some
luggage
upon
a
barrow
made
his
noisy
approach
he
was
followed
by
a
tall
young
man
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
and
a
straw
hat
on
which
were
the
colours
of
a
famous
cricket
club
the
inspector
watched
them
curiously
lost
his
way
i
should
think
he
observed
the
nodded
it
looks
like
the
young
man
who
missed
the
boat
train
he
remarked
perhaps
he
has
come
to
beg
a
the
young
man
in
question
made
steady
progress
up
the
platform
his
hands
were
thrust
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
and
his
forehead
was
contracted
in
a
frown
as
he
approached
more
closely
he
singled
out
john
dunster
and
motioning
his
porter
to
wait
crossed
to
the
edge
of
the
track
and
addressed
him
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
sir
john
dunster
turned
at
once
and
faced
his
questioner
he
did
so
without
haste
with
a
certain
deliberation
in
fact
yet
his
eyes
were
suddenly
bright
and
keen
he
was
neatly
dressed
with
the
quiet
precision
which
seems
as
a
rule
to
characterise
the
travelling
american
he
was
apparently
of
a
little
less
than
with
every
appearance
of
physical
strength
he
seemed
like
a
man
on
wires
a
man
on
the
alert
likely
to
miss
nothing
are
you
john
dunster
the
youth
asked
i
carry
my
in
my
hand
sir
the
other
replied
swinging
his
around
my
name
is
john
the
young
man
s
expression
was
scarcely
ingratiating
to
a
natural
sullenness
was
added
now
the
nervous
distaste
of
one
who
approaches
a
disagreeable
task
i
want
if
i
may
to
ask
you
a
favour
he
continued
if
you
don
t
feel
like
granting
it
please
say
no
and
i
ll
be
off
at
once
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
hague
i
was
to
have
gone
by
the
boat
train
which
left
half
an
hour
ago
i
had
taken
a
seat
and
they
assured
me
that
the
train
would
not
leave
for
at
least
ten
minutes
as
the
mails
weren
t
in
i
went
down
the
platform
to
buy
some
papers
and
stood
talking
for
a
moment
or
two
with
a
man
whom
i
know
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
longer
than
i
thought
or
they
must
have
been
quicker
than
they
expected
with
the
mailbags
anyhow
when
i
came
back
the
train
was
moving
they
would
not
let
me
jump
in
i
could
have
done
it
easily
but
that
fool
of
an
inspector
over
there
held
they
are
very
strict
in
this
country
i
dunster
agreed
without
change
of
expression
please
go
i
saw
you
arrive
just
too
late
for
the
train
while
i
was
swearing
at
the
inspector
i
heard
you
speak
to
the
since
then
i
have
made
inquiries
i
understand
that
you
have
ordered
a
special
train
to
john
dunster
said
nothing
only
his
keen
clear
eyes
seemed
all
the
time
to
be
questioning
this
but
apparently
harmless
young
man
i
went
to
the
s
office
the
latter
continued
and
tried
to
persuade
them
to
let
me
ride
in
the
guard
s
van
of
your
special
but
he
made
a
stupid
fuss
about
it
so
i
thought
i
d
better
come
to
you
can
i
beg
a
seat
in
your
compartment
or
anywhere
in
the
train
as
far
as
harwich
dunster
avoided
for
the
moment
a
direct
reply
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
whether
reasonably
or
unreasonably
disliked
the
request
which
had
been
made
to
him
you
are
particularly
anxious
to
cross
he
asked
i
am
the
youth
admitted
emphatically
i
never
ought
to
have
risked
missing
the
train
i
am
due
at
the
hague
john
dunster
moved
his
position
a
little
the
light
from
a
gas
lamp
shone
now
full
upon
the
face
of
his
suppliant
a
boy
s
face
which
would
have
been
pleasant
and
even
handsome
but
for
the
discontented
mouth
the
lowering
forehead
and
a
shadow
in
the
eyes
as
though
boy
though
he
certainly
was
in
years
he
had
already
at
some
time
or
another
looked
upon
the
serious
things
of
life
his
nervousness
too
was
almost
grotesque
he
had
the
air
of
disliking
immensely
this
asking
a
favour
from
a
stranger
dunster
appreciated
all
these
things
but
there
were
reasons
which
made
him
slow
in
granting
the
young
man
s
request
what
is
the
nature
of
your
pressing
business
at
the
hague
he
asked
the
youth
hesitated
i
am
afraid
he
said
grimly
that
you
will
not
think
it
of
much
importance
i
am
on
my
way
to
play
in
a
golf
tournament
a
golf
tournament
at
the
hague
dunster
repeated
in
a
slightly
altered
tone
what
is
your
name
gerald
dunster
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
he
was
possessed
of
a
wonderful
memory
and
he
was
conscious
at
that
moment
of
a
subtle
appeal
to
it
fentolin
there
was
something
in
the
name
which
seemed
to
him
somehow
associated
with
the
things
against
which
he
was
on
guard
he
stood
with
puzzled
frown
reminiscent
for
several
minutes
unsuccessful
then
he
suddenly
smiled
and
moving
underneath
the
gas
lamp
shook
open
an
evening
paper
which
he
had
been
carrying
he
turned
over
the
pages
until
he
arrived
at
the
sporting
items
here
in
almost
the
first
paragraph
he
saw
the
name
which
had
happened
to
catch
his
eye
a
moment
or
two
before
golf
at
the
hague
among
the
entrants
for
the
tournament
which
commences
are
several
english
players
including
barwin
parrott
hillard
and
gerald
fentolin
dunster
folded
up
the
newspaper
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
he
turned
towards
the
young
man
so
you
re
a
golfer
are
you
i
play
a
bit
was
the
somewhat
indifferent
reply
dunster
turned
to
another
part
of
the
paper
and
pointed
to
the
great
black
seems
a
queer
thing
for
a
young
fellow
like
you
to
be
worrying
about
games
he
remarked
i
haven
t
been
in
this
country
more
than
a
few
hours
but
i
expected
to
find
all
the
young
men
getting
getting
ready
for
what
why
to
fight
of
course
dunster
replied
seems
pretty
clear
that
there
s
an
expeditionary
force
being
fitted
out
according
to
this
evening
s
paper
somewhere
up
in
the
north
sea
the
only
englishman
i
ve
spoken
to
on
this
side
was
willing
to
lay
me
odds
that
war
would
be
declared
within
a
the
young
man
s
lack
of
interest
was
curious
i
am
not
in
the
army
he
said
it
really
doesn
t
affect
dunster
stared
at
him
you
ll
forgive
my
curiosity
he
said
but
say
is
there
nothing
you
could
get
into
and
fight
if
this
thing
came
along
nothing
at
all
that
i
know
of
the
youth
replied
coolly
war
is
an
affair
which
concerns
only
the
military
and
naval
part
of
two
countries
the
civil
population
plays
golf
i
suppose
dunster
interrupted
young
man
i
haven
t
been
in
england
for
some
years
and
you
rather
take
my
breath
away
all
the
same
you
can
come
along
with
me
as
far
as
the
young
man
showed
signs
of
some
satisfaction
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
he
declared
i
promise
you
i
won
t
be
in
the
the
who
had
been
looking
through
a
little
pile
of
telegrams
brought
to
him
by
a
clerk
from
his
office
now
turned
towards
them
his
expression
was
a
little
grave
your
special
will
be
backing
down
directly
sir
he
announced
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
hear
very
bad
accounts
of
the
line
they
say
that
this
is
only
the
of
the
storm
that
we
are
getting
here
and
that
it
s
been
raging
for
nearly
hours
on
the
east
coast
i
doubt
whether
the
harwich
boat
will
be
able
to
put
we
must
take
our
chance
about
that
dunster
remarked
if
the
mail
boat
doesn
t
run
i
presume
there
will
be
something
else
we
can
the
looked
the
curiosity
which
he
did
not
actually
express
in
words
money
will
buy
most
things
nowadays
sir
he
observed
but
if
it
isn
t
fit
for
our
mail
boat
it
certainly
isn
t
fit
for
anything
else
that
can
come
into
harwich
harbour
however
you
ll
hear
what
they
say
when
you
get
dunster
nodded
and
relapsed
into
a
taciturnity
which
was
obviously
one
of
his
peculiarities
the
young
man
strolled
down
the
platform
and
catching
up
with
the
inspector
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
do
you
know
who
the
fellow
is
he
asked
curiously
it
s
awfully
decent
of
him
to
let
me
go
with
him
but
he
didn
t
seem
very
keen
about
the
inspector
shook
his
head
no
idea
sir
he
replied
he
drove
up
just
two
minutes
after
the
train
had
gone
came
straight
into
the
office
and
ordered
a
special
paid
for
it
too
in
bank
of
england
notes
before
he
went
out
i
fancy
he
s
an
american
and
he
gave
his
name
as
john
the
young
man
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
if
he
s
an
american
i
suppose
that
accounts
for
it
he
observed
he
must
be
in
a
precious
hurry
to
get
somewhere
a
night
like
this
too
the
inspector
remarked
with
a
shiver
i
wouldn
t
leave
london
myself
unless
i
had
to
they
say
there
s
a
tremendous
storm
blowing
on
the
east
coast
here
comes
the
train
sir
just
one
saloon
and
the
guard
s
the
little
train
backed
slowly
along
the
platform
side
the
engine
was
splashed
with
mud
and
soaking
wet
the
faces
of
the
and
his
companion
shone
from
the
dripping
rain
the
held
open
the
door
of
the
saloon
you
ve
a
rough
journey
before
you
sir
he
said
you
ll
catch
the
boat
all
right
though
if
it
goes
the
mail
train
was
very
heavy
you
should
catch
her
up
this
side
of
dunster
nodded
i
am
taking
this
young
gentleman
with
me
he
announced
shortly
it
seems
that
he
too
missed
the
train
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
attention
good
night
they
were
about
to
start
when
dunster
once
more
let
down
the
window
by
the
way
he
said
as
it
is
such
a
wild
night
you
will
oblige
me
very
much
if
you
will
tell
the
that
there
will
be
a
five
pound
note
for
himself
and
his
companion
if
we
catch
the
mail
inspector
the
inspector
touched
his
hat
the
had
turned
discreetly
away
he
had
been
an
inspector
himself
once
and
sovereigns
had
been
useful
to
him
too
then
the
train
glided
from
the
platform
side
plunged
with
a
scream
through
a
succession
of
black
tunnels
and
with
rapidly
increasing
speed
faced
the
storm
chapter
ii
the
young
man
sat
on
one
side
of
the
saloon
and
john
dunster
on
the
other
although
both
of
them
were
provided
with
a
certain
amount
of
railway
literature
neither
of
them
made
any
pretence
at
reading
the
older
man
with
his
feet
upon
the
opposite
seat
and
his
arms
folded
was
looking
pensively
through
the
into
the
impenetrable
darkness
the
young
man
although
he
could
not
ignore
his
companion
s
unsociable
instincts
was
fidgety
there
will
be
some
floods
out
he
remarked
dunster
turned
his
head
and
looked
across
the
saloon
there
was
something
in
the
deliberate
manner
of
his
doing
so
and
his
hesitation
before
he
spoke
which
seemed
intended
to
further
impress
upon
the
young
man
the
fact
that
he
was
not
disposed
for
conversation
very
likely
was
his
sole
reply
gerald
fentolin
sighed
as
though
he
regretted
his
companion
s
taciturnity
and
a
few
minutes
later
strolled
to
the
farther
end
of
the
saloon
he
spent
some
time
trying
to
peer
through
the
streaming
window
into
the
darkness
he
chatted
for
a
few
minutes
with
the
guard
who
was
however
in
a
bad
temper
at
having
had
to
turn
out
and
who
found
little
to
say
then
he
took
one
of
his
golf
clubs
from
the
bag
and
indulged
in
several
half
swings
finally
he
stretched
himself
out
upon
one
of
the
seats
and
closed
his
eyes
may
as
well
try
to
get
a
nap
he
yawned
there
won
t
be
much
chance
on
the
steamer
if
it
blows
like
dunster
said
nothing
his
face
was
set
his
eyes
were
looking
somewhere
beyond
the
confines
of
the
saloon
in
which
he
was
seated
so
they
travelled
for
over
an
hour
the
young
man
seemed
to
be
dozing
in
earnest
when
with
a
succession
of
jerks
the
train
rapidly
slackened
speed
dunster
let
down
the
window
the
interior
of
the
carriage
was
at
once
thrown
into
confusion
a
couple
of
newspapers
were
caught
up
and
whirled
around
a
torrent
of
rain
beat
in
dunster
rapidly
closed
the
window
and
rang
the
bell
the
guard
came
in
after
a
moment
or
two
his
clothes
were
shiny
from
the
wet
raindrops
hung
from
his
beard
what
is
the
matter
dunster
demanded
why
are
we
waiting
here
there
s
a
block
on
the
line
somewhere
the
man
replied
can
t
tell
where
exactly
the
signals
are
against
us
that
s
all
we
know
at
they
crawled
on
again
in
about
ten
minutes
stopped
and
resumed
their
progress
at
an
even
slower
rate
dunster
once
more
summoned
the
guard
why
are
we
travelling
like
this
he
asked
impatiently
we
shall
never
catch
the
we
shall
catch
the
boat
all
right
if
it
runs
sir
the
man
assured
him
the
mail
is
only
a
mile
or
two
ahead
of
us
that
s
one
reason
why
we
have
to
go
so
slowly
then
the
water
is
right
over
the
line
where
we
are
now
and
we
can
t
get
any
news
at
all
from
the
other
side
of
ipswich
if
it
goes
on
like
this
some
of
the
bridges
will
be
down
that
s
what
i
m
afraid
dunster
frowned
for
the
first
time
he
showed
some
signs
of
uneasiness
perhaps
he
muttered
half
to
himself
a
would
have
been
not
on
your
life
his
young
companion
intervened
all
the
roads
to
the
coast
here
cross
no
end
of
small
bridges
much
weaker
affairs
than
the
railway
bridges
i
bet
there
are
some
of
those
down
already
besides
you
wouldn
t
be
able
to
see
where
you
were
going
on
a
night
like
there
appears
to
be
a
chance
dunster
remarked
drily
that
you
will
have
to
scratch
for
your
competition
also
the
young
man
observed
that
you
will
have
taken
this
special
train
for
nothing
i
can
t
fancy
the
harwich
boat
going
out
a
night
like
dunster
relapsed
into
stony
but
anxious
silence
the
train
continued
its
erratic
progress
sometimes
stopping
altogether
for
a
time
with
whistle
blowing
repeatedly
sometimes
creeping
along
the
metals
as
though
feeling
its
way
to
safety
at
last
after
a
somewhat
prolonged
wait
the
guard
whose
hoarse
voice
they
had
heard
on
the
platform
of
the
small
station
in
which
they
were
standing
entered
the
carriage
with
him
came
a
gust
of
wind
once
more
sending
the
papers
flying
around
the
compartment
the
rain
dripped
from
his
clothes
on
to
the
carpet
he
had
lost
his
hat
his
hair
was
tossed
with
the
wind
his
face
was
bleeding
from
a
slight
wound
on
the
temple
the
boat
train
s
just
ahead
of
us
sir
he
announced
she
can
t
get
on
any
better
than
we
can
we
ve
just
heard
that
there
s
a
bridge
down
on
the
line
between
ipswich
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
then
dunster
demanded
that
s
just
what
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
sir
the
guard
replied
the
mail
s
going
slowly
on
as
far
as
ipswich
i
fancy
they
ll
lie
by
there
until
the
morning
the
best
thing
that
i
can
see
is
if
you
re
agreeable
to
take
you
back
to
london
we
can
very
likely
do
that
all
right
if
we
start
at
dunster
ignoring
the
man
s
suggestion
drew
from
one
of
the
voluminous
pockets
of
his
ulster
a
small
map
he
spread
it
open
upon
the
table
before
him
and
studied
it
attentively
if
i
can
not
get
to
harwich
he
asked
is
there
any
possibility
of
keeping
straight
on
and
reaching
yarmouth
the
guard
hesitated
we
haven
t
heard
anything
about
the
line
from
ipswich
to
norwich
sir
he
replied
but
we
can
t
very
well
change
our
course
without
definite
your
definite
instructions
dunster
reminded
him
drily
were
to
take
me
to
harwich
you
have
been
forced
to
depart
from
them
i
see
no
harm
in
your
adopting
any
suggestions
i
may
have
to
make
concerning
our
altered
destination
i
will
pay
the
extra
mileage
how
far
did
you
wish
to
go
sir
the
guard
enquired
to
yarmouth
dunster
replied
firmly
if
there
are
bridges
down
and
communication
with
harwich
is
blocked
yarmouth
would
suit
me
better
than
the
guard
shook
his
head
i
couldn
t
go
on
that
way
sir
without
is
there
a
telegraph
office
at
this
station
dunster
inquired
we
can
speak
anywhere
on
the
line
the
guard
replied
then
wire
to
the
at
liverpool
street
dunster
instructed
you
can
get
a
reply
from
him
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
explain
the
situation
and
tell
him
what
my
wishes
the
guard
hesitated
it
s
a
goodish
way
from
here
to
norwich
he
observed
and
for
all
we
know
when
we
left
liverpool
street
station
dunster
interrupted
i
promised
five
pounds
each
to
you
the
and
his
mate
that
five
pounds
shall
be
made
if
you
succeed
in
getting
me
to
the
coast
do
your
best
for
the
guard
raised
his
hat
and
departed
without
another
word
it
will
probably
suit
you
better
dunster
continued
turning
to
his
companion
to
leave
me
at
ipswich
and
join
the
the
latter
shook
his
head
i
don
t
see
that
there
s
any
chance
anyway
of
my
getting
over
in
time
now
he
remarked
if
you
ll
take
me
on
with
you
as
far
as
norwich
i
can
go
quietly
home
from
there
you
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
then
dunster
asked
the
young
man
assented
again
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
in
his
manner
i
live
some
distance
the
other
side
of
norwich
he
said
i
don
t
want
to
sponge
on
you
too
much
he
went
on
but
if
you
re
really
going
to
stick
it
out
and
try
and
get
there
i
d
like
to
go
on
too
i
am
afraid
i
can
t
offer
to
share
the
expense
but
i
d
work
my
passage
if
there
was
anything
to
be
dunster
drummed
for
a
moment
upon
the
table
with
his
fingers
all
the
time
the
young
man
had
been
speaking
his
eyes
had
been
studying
his
face
he
turned
now
once
more
to
his
map
it
was
my
idea
he
said
to
hire
a
steam
trawler
from
yarmouth
if
i
do
so
you
can
if
you
wish
accompany
me
so
far
as
the
port
at
which
we
may
land
in
holland
on
the
other
hand
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
i
should
prefer
to
go
alone
there
will
be
no
doubt
a
certain
amount
of
risk
in
crossing
my
own
business
is
of
importance
a
golf
tournament
however
is
scarcely
worth
risking
your
life
for
is
it
oh
i
don
t
know
about
that
the
young
man
replied
grimly
i
fancy
i
should
rather
like
it
let
s
see
whether
we
can
get
on
to
norwich
anyhow
shall
we
we
may
find
that
there
are
bridges
down
on
that
they
relapsed
once
more
into
silence
presently
the
guard
reappeared
instructions
to
take
you
on
to
yarmouth
if
possible
sir
he
announced
and
to
collect
the
mileage
at
our
that
will
be
quite
satisfactory
dunster
agreed
let
us
be
off
then
as
soon
as
presently
they
crawled
on
they
passed
the
boat
train
in
ipswich
station
where
they
stayed
for
a
few
moments
dunster
bought
wine
and
sandwiches
and
his
companion
followed
his
example
then
they
continued
their
journey
an
hour
or
more
passed
the
storm
showed
no
signs
of
abatement
their
speed
now
rarely
exceeded
ten
or
fifteen
miles
an
hour
dunster
smoked
all
the
time
occasionally
rubbing
the
and
trying
to
look
out
gerald
fentolin
slept
fitfully
have
you
any
idea
where
we
are
dunster
asked
once
the
boy
cautiously
let
down
the
window
a
little
way
with
the
noise
of
the
storm
came
another
sound
to
which
he
listened
for
a
moment
with
puzzled
face
a
dull
rumbling
sound
like
the
falling
of
water
he
closed
the
window
breathless
i
don
t
think
we
are
far
from
norwich
we
passed
forncett
anyhow
some
time
still
raining
in
torrents
i
can
t
see
a
yard
ahead
of
me
i
bet
we
get
some
floods
after
this
i
expect
they
are
out
now
if
one
could
only
they
crept
on
suddenly
above
the
storm
they
heard
what
sounded
at
first
like
the
booming
of
a
gun
and
then
a
shrill
whistle
from
some
distance
ahead
they
felt
the
jerk
as
their
brakes
were
hastily
applied
the
swaying
of
the
little
train
and
then
the
crunching
of
earth
beneath
them
the
roar
of
escaping
steam
as
their
engine
ploughed
its
way
on
into
the
road
bed
off
the
rails
the
boy
cried
springing
to
his
feet
hold
on
tightly
sir
i
d
keep
away
from
the
the
carriage
swayed
and
rocked
suddenly
a
telegraph
post
seemed
to
come
crashing
through
the
window
and
the
polished
mahogany
panels
the
young
man
escaped
it
by
leaping
to
one
side
it
caught
dunster
who
had
just
risen
to
his
feet
upon
the
forehead
there
was
a
crash
all
around
of
splitting
glass
a
further
shock
they
were
both
thrown
off
their
feet
the
light
was
suddenly
extinguished
with
the
crashing
of
glass
the
splitting
of
timber
a
hideous
tearing
sound
the
wrecked
saloon
dragging
the
engine
over
with
it
slipped
down
a
low
embankment
and
lay
on
its
side
what
remained
of
it
in
a
field
of
turnips
chapter
iii
as
the
young
man
staggered
to
his
feet
he
had
somehow
a
sense
of
detachment
as
though
he
were
commencing
a
new
life
or
had
suddenly
come
into
a
new
existence
yet
his
immediate
surroundings
were
charged
with
ugly
reminiscences
through
a
great
gap
in
the
ruined
side
of
the
saloon
the
rain
was
tearing
in
as
he
stood
up
his
head
caught
the
fragments
of
the
roof
he
was
able
to
push
back
the
wreckage
with
ease
and
step
out
for
a
moment
he
reeled
as
he
met
the
violence
of
the
storm
then
clutching
hold
of
the
side
of
the
wreck
he
steadied
himself
a
light
was
moving
back
and
forth
close
at
hand
he
cried
out
weakly
hullo
a
man
carrying
a
lantern
bent
double
as
he
made
his
way
against
the
wind
crawled
up
to
them
he
was
a
porter
from
the
station
close
at
hand
my
god
he
exclaimed
any
one
alive
here
i
m
all
right
gerald
muttered
at
least
i
suppose
i
am
what
s
it
all
what
s
it
all
about
we
ve
had
an
the
porter
caught
hold
of
a
piece
of
the
wreckage
with
which
to
steady
himself
your
train
ran
right
into
three
feet
of
water
he
answered
the
rails
had
gone
torn
up
the
telegraph
line
s
why
didn
t
you
stop
the
train
we
were
doing
all
we
could
the
man
retorted
gloomily
we
weren
t
expecting
anything
else
through
we
d
a
man
along
the
line
with
a
lantern
but
he
s
just
been
found
blown
over
the
embankment
with
his
head
in
a
pool
of
water
any
one
else
in
your
carriage
one
gentleman
travelling
with
me
gerald
answered
we
d
better
try
to
get
him
out
what
about
the
guard
and
the
and
stoker
are
both
alive
the
porter
told
him
i
came
across
them
before
i
saw
you
they
re
both
knocked
sort
of
sillylike
but
they
aren
t
much
hurt
the
guard
s
stone
where
are
we
a
few
hundred
yards
from
wymondham
let
s
have
a
look
for
the
other
john
dunster
was
lying
quite
still
his
right
leg
doubled
up
and
a
huge
block
of
telegraph
post
which
the
saloon
had
carried
with
it
in
its
fall
still
pressing
against
his
forehead
he
groaned
as
they
dragged
him
out
and
laid
him
down
upon
a
cushion
in
the
shelter
of
the
wreckage
he
s
alive
all
right
the
porter
remarked
there
s
a
doctor
on
the
way
let
s
cover
him
up
quick
and
can
t
we
carry
him
to
shelter
of
some
sort
gerald
proposed
the
man
shook
his
head
speech
of
any
sort
was
difficult
even
with
his
lips
close
to
the
other
s
ears
he
had
almost
to
shout
couldn
t
be
done
he
replied
it
s
all
one
can
do
to
walk
alone
when
you
get
out
in
the
middle
of
the
field
away
from
the
shelter
of
the
embankment
here
there
s
bits
of
trees
flying
all
down
the
lane
never
was
such
a
night
folks
is
fair
afraid
of
the
morning
to
see
what
s
happened
there
s
a
mill
blown
right
over
on
its
side
in
the
next
field
and
the
man
in
charge
of
it
lying
dead
this
poor
chap
s
bad
gerald
on
all
fours
had
crept
back
into
the
compartment
the
bottle
of
wine
was
smashed
into
atoms
he
came
out
dragging
the
small
which
his
companion
had
kept
on
the
table
before
him
one
side
of
it
was
dented
in
but
the
lock
which
was
of
great
strength
still
held
perhaps
there
s
a
flask
somewhere
in
this
gerald
said
lend
me
a
strong
though
it
had
been
the
lock
was
already
almost
torn
out
from
its
foundation
they
forced
the
spring
and
opened
it
the
porter
turned
his
lantern
on
the
widening
space
just
as
gerald
was
raising
the
lid
very
slowly
to
save
the
contents
from
being
scattered
by
the
wind
the
man
turned
his
head
to
answer
an
approaching
hail
gerald
raised
the
lid
a
little
higher
and
suddenly
closed
it
with
a
bang
there
s
folks
coming
at
last
the
porter
exclaimed
turning
around
excitedly
they
ve
been
a
time
and
no
mistake
the
village
isn
t
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
did
you
find
a
flask
sir
gerald
made
no
answer
the
once
more
was
closed
and
his
hand
pressed
upon
the
lid
the
porter
turned
the
light
upon
his
face
and
whistled
softly
you
re
about
done
yourself
sir
he
remarked
hold
he
caught
the
young
man
in
his
arms
there
was
another
roar
in
gerald
s
ears
besides
the
roar
of
the
wind
he
had
never
fainted
in
his
life
but
the
feeling
was
upon
him
now
a
deadly
sickness
a
swaying
of
the
earth
the
porter
suddenly
gave
a
little
cry
if
i
m
not
a
born
idiot
he
exclaimed
drawing
a
bottle
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
with
his
disengaged
hand
there
s
whisky
here
i
was
taking
it
home
to
the
missis
for
her
rheumatism
now
he
drew
the
cork
from
the
bottle
with
his
teeth
and
forced
some
of
the
liquid
between
the
lips
of
the
young
man
the
voices
now
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
gerald
made
a
desperate
effort
i
am
all
right
he
declared
let
s
look
after
they
groped
their
way
towards
the
unconscious
man
gerald
still
gripping
the
with
both
hands
there
were
no
signs
of
any
change
in
his
condition
but
he
was
still
breathing
heavily
then
they
heard
a
shout
behind
almost
in
their
ears
the
porter
staggered
to
his
feet
it
s
all
right
now
sir
he
exclaimed
they
ve
brought
blankets
and
a
stretcher
and
brandy
here
s
a
doctor
a
man
hatless
and
wrapped
in
a
great
ulster
moved
towards
them
how
many
are
there
of
you
he
asked
as
he
bent
over
dunster
only
we
two
gerald
replied
is
my
friend
badly
hurt
concussion
the
doctor
announced
we
ll
take
him
to
the
village
what
about
you
young
man
your
face
is
bleeding
i
just
a
cut
gerald
faltered
nothing
lucky
chap
the
doctor
remarked
let
s
get
him
to
shelter
of
some
sort
come
along
there
s
an
inn
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
they
all
staggered
along
gerald
still
clutching
the
and
supported
on
the
other
side
by
an
excited
and
somewhat
incoherent
villager
such
a
storm
as
never
was
the
latter
volunteered
the
telegraph
wires
are
all
down
for
miles
and
miles
there
won
t
be
no
trains
running
along
this
line
come
many
a
week
and
as
for
trees
why
it
s
as
though
some
one
had
been
playing
ninepins
in
squire
fellowes
s
park
when
the
morning
do
come
for
sure
there
will
be
things
to
be
seen
this
way
sir
be
careful
of
the
they
staggered
along
down
the
lane
climbing
once
over
a
tree
which
lay
across
the
lane
and
far
into
the
adjoining
field
soon
they
were
joined
by
more
of
the
villagers
roused
from
their
beds
by
rumours
of
terrible
happenings
the
little
inn
was
all
lit
up
and
the
door
held
firmly
open
they
passed
through
the
narrow
entrance
and
into
the
barroom
where
the
men
laid
down
their
stretcher
as
many
of
the
villagers
as
could
crowd
in
filled
the
passage
gerald
sank
into
a
chair
the
sudden
absence
of
wind
was
almost
disconcerting
he
felt
himself
once
more
in
danger
of
fainting
he
was
only
vaguely
conscious
of
drinking
hot
milk
poured
from
a
jug
by
a
and
sympathetic
woman
its
restorative
effect
however
was
immediate
and
wonderful
the
mist
cleared
from
before
his
eyes
his
brain
began
to
work
always
in
the
background
the
horror
and
the
shame
were
there
the
shame
which
kept
his
hand
pressed
with
unnatural
strength
upon
the
broken
lock
of
that
he
sat
a
little
apart
from
the
others
and
listened
above
the
confused
murmur
of
voices
he
could
hear
the
doctor
s
comment
and
brief
orders
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
after
examining
the
unconscious
man
an
ordinary
concussion
he
declared
i
must
get
round
and
see
the
now
they
have
got
him
in
a
shed
by
the
embankment
i
ll
call
in
again
later
on
let
s
have
one
more
look
at
you
young
he
glanced
at
the
cut
on
gerald
s
forehead
noted
the
access
of
colour
in
his
cheeks
and
nodded
born
to
be
hanged
you
were
he
pronounced
you
ve
had
a
marvellous
escape
i
ll
be
in
again
presently
no
need
to
worry
about
your
friend
he
looks
as
though
he
d
got
a
mighty
constitution
light
my
lantern
brown
two
of
you
had
better
come
with
me
to
the
shed
it
s
no
night
for
a
man
to
be
wandering
about
he
departed
and
many
of
the
villagers
with
him
the
landlady
sat
down
and
began
to
weep
such
a
night
such
a
night
she
exclaimed
wringing
her
hands
and
there
s
the
doctor
talks
about
putting
the
poor
gentleman
to
bed
why
the
roof
s
off

and
the
rain
coming
in
there
in
torrents
such
a
night
it

the
judgment

what
s
the
good
of
sitting
there
whining

the
fire
she
repeated
bitterly
and
the
chimney
lying
out
in
the
road
do
you
want
to
suffocate
us
all
or
is
the
beer
still
in
your
head
it
s
your
evil
doings
richard
budden
and
others
like
you
that
have
brought
this
upon
us
if
wembley
would
but
come
in
and
pray
her
husband
scoffed
he
was
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
his
hair
rough
his
braces
hanging
down
behind
come
in
and
pray
he
repeated
not
he
not
wembley
he
s
safe
tucked
up
in
his
bed
shivering
with
fear
i
ll
bet
you
he
s
not
getting
his
feet
wet
to
save
a
body
or
lend
a
hand
here
souls
are
his
job
you

preacher

the
lord

knows
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
can
i
hire
a
from
anywhere
near
gerald
asked
there
s
right
enough
the
innkeeper
replied
but
not
many
as
would
be
fools
enough
to
take
one
out
you
couldn
t
see
the
road
and
i
doubt
if
one
of
them
plaguey
things
would
stir
in
this
such
nonsense
as
you
talk
richard
budden
his
wife
exclaimed
sharply
it
s
twenty
minutes
past
three
of
the
clock
and
there
s
light
coming
on
us
fast
if
so
be
as
the
young
gentleman
knows
folks
round
about
here
or
happens
to
live
nigh
why
shouldn
t
he
take
one
of
them
and
get
away
to
some
decent
place
it
ll
be
better
for
the
poor
gentleman
than
lying
here
in
a
house
smitten
by
the
gerald
rose
stiffly
to
his
feet
an
idea
was
forming
in
his
brain
his
eyes
were
bright
he
looked
at
the
body
of
john
dunster
upon
the
floor
and
felt
once
more
in
his
pocket
how
far
off
is
the
garage
he
asked
it
s
right
across
the
way
the
innkeeper
replied
a
speculation
of
neighbour
martin
s
and
a
foolish
one
it
do
seem
to
me
he
s
two
cars
there
and
one
he
lets
to
the
government
for
delivering
the
gerald
felt
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
sovereign
give
this
he
said
to
any
man
you
can
find
who
will
go
across
there
and
bring
me
a
car
the
most
powerful
they
ve
got
if
there
s
any
difference
tell
them
i
ll
pay
well
this
my
friend
will
be
much
better
at
home
with
me
than
in
a
strange
place
when
he
comes
to
his
it
s
sound
common
sense
the
woman
declared
be
off
with
you
the
man
was
looking
at
the
coin
covetously
but
his
wife
pushed
him
away
it
s
not
a
sovereign
you
ll
be
taking
from
the
gentleman
for
a
little
errand
like
that
she
insisted
sharply
he
shall
pay
us
for
what
he
s
had
when
he
goes
and
welcome
and
if
so
be
that
he
s
willing
to
make
it
a
sovereign
to
include
the
milk
and
the
brandy
and
the
confusion
we
ve
been
put
to
this
night
well
and
good
it
s
a
heavy
reckoning
maybe
but
the
night
calls
for
it
we
ll
see
about
that
afterwards
get
along
with
you
i
say
i
ll
be
wet
through
the
man
muttered
and
serve
you
right
the
woman
exclaimed
if
there
s
a
man
in
this
village
whose
clothes
are
dry
it
s
a
thing
for
him
to
be
ashamed
the
innkeeper
reluctantly
departed
they
heard
the
roar
of
the
wind
as
the
door
was
opened
and
closed
the
woman
poured
out
another
glass
of
milk
and
brought
it
to
gerald
a
godless
man
mine
she
said
grimly
if
so
happen
as
wembley
had
come
to
these
parts
years
ago
i
d
have
seen
myself
in
my
grave
before
i
d
have
married
a
publican
but
it
s
too
late
now
we
re
mostly
too
late
about
the
things
that
count
in
this
world
so
it
s
your
friend
that
s
been
stricken
down
young
man
a
man
i
hope
gerald
shivered
ever
so
slightly
he
drank
the
milk
however
he
felt
that
he
might
need
his
strength
what
train
might
you
have
been
on
the
woman
continued
there
s
none
due
on
this
line
that
we
knew
of
david
bass
the
was
here
but
two
hours
ago
and
said
he
d
finished
for
the
night
and
praised
the
lord
for
that
the
goods
trains
had
all
been
stopped
at
ipswich
and
the
first
passenger
train
was
not
due
till
six
o
gerald
shook
his
head
with
an
affectation
of
weariness
i
don
t
know
he
replied
i
don
t
remember
anything
about
it
we
were
hours
late
i
the
woman
was
looking
down
at
the
unconscious
man
gerald
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
and
stood
by
her
side
the
face
of
john
dunster
even
in
unconsciousness
had
something
in
it
of
strength
and
purpose
the
shape
of
his
head
the
squareness
of
his
jaws
the
straightness
of
his
thick
lips
all
seemed
to
speak
of
a
hard
and
inflexible
disposition
his
hair
was
coal
black
coarse
and
without
the
slightest
sprinkling
of
grey
he
had
the
neck
and
throat
of
a
fighter
but
for
that
single
livid
blue
mark
across
his
forehead
he
carried
with
him
no
signs
of
his
accident
he
was
a
little
inclined
to
be
stout
there
was
a
heavy
gold
chain
stretched
across
his
from
where
he
lay
the
shining
handle
of
his
revolver
protruded
from
his
hip
pocket
sakes
alive
the
woman
muttered
as
she
looked
down
what
does
he
carry
a
thing
like
that
for
in
a
peaceful
country
too
it
was
just
an
idea
of
his
gerald
answered
we
were
going
abroad
in
a
day
or
two
he
was
always
nervous
if
you
like
i
ll
take
it
he
stooped
down
and
withdrew
it
from
the
unconscious
man
s
pocket
he
started
as
he
discovered
that
it
was
loaded
in
every
chamber
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
them
things
the
woman
declared
it
s
the
men
of
evil
ways
who
ve
no
trust
in
the
lord
who
need
that
sort
of
they
heard
the
door
pushed
open
the
howl
of
wind
down
the
passage
and
the
beating
of
rain
upon
the
stone
flags
then
it
was
softly
closed
again
the
landlord
staggered
into
the
room
followed
by
a
young
man
this
ere
is
martin
s
chaffer
he
announced
you
can
tell
him
what
you
want
gerald
turned
almost
eagerly
towards
the
newcomer
i
want
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
holt
he
said
and
get
my
friend
get
this
gentleman
away
from
here
get
him
home
if
possible
can
you
take
me
the
chauffeur
looked
doubtful
i
m
afraid
of
the
roads
sir
he
replied
there
s
talk
about
many
bridges
down
and
trees
and
there
s
floods
out
everywhere
there
s
half
a
foot
of
water
even
across
the
village
street
now
i
m
afraid
we
shouldn
t
get
very
look
here
gerald
begged
eagerly
let
s
make
a
shot
at
it
i
ll
pay
you
double
the
hire
of
the
car
and
i
ll
be
responsible
for
any
damage
i
want
to
get
out
of
this
beastly
place
let
s
get
somewhere
at
any
rate
towards
a
civilised
country
i
ll
see
you
don
t
lose
anything
i
ll
give
you
a
five
pound
note
for
yourself
if
we
get
as
far
as
i
m
on
the
young
man
agreed
shortly
it
s
an
open
car
you
it
doesn
t
matter
gerald
replied
i
can
stick
it
in
front
with
you
and
we
can
cover
him
up
in
the
you
ll
wait
until
the
doctor
comes
back
the
landlord
asked
and
why
should
they
his
wife
interposed
sharply
them
doctors
are
all
the
same
he
ll
try
and
keep
the
poor
gentleman
here
for
the
sake
of
a
few
extra
guineas
and
a
miserable
place
for
him
to
open
his
eyes
upon
even
if
the
rest
of
the
roof
holds
which
for
my
part
i
m
beginning
to
doubt
they
d
have
to
move
him
from
here
with
the
daylight
anyhow
he
can
t
lie
in
the
bar
parlour
all
day
can
he
it
don
t
seem
right
somehow
the
man
complained
doggedly
the
doctor
didn
t
say
anything
about
having
him
you
get
the
car
gerald
ordered
the
young
man
i
ll
take
the
whole
the
chauffeur
silently
left
the
room
gerald
put
a
couple
of
sovereigns
upon
the
mantelpiece
my
friend
is
a
man
of
somewhat
peculiar
temperament
he
said
quietly
if
he
finds
himself
at
home
in
a
comfortable
room
when
he
comes
to
his
senses
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
will
have
a
better
chance
of
recovery
he
can
not
possibly
be
made
comfortable
here
and
he
will
feel
the
shock
of
what
has
happened
all
the
more
if
he
finds
himself
still
in
the
neighbourhood
when
he
opens
his
eyes
if
there
is
any
change
in
his
condition
we
can
easily
stop
somewhere
on
the
the
woman
pocketed
the
two
sovereigns
that
s
common
sense
sir
she
agreed
heartily
and
i
m
sure
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
if
we
had
a
decent
room
and
a
roof
above
it
you
d
be
heartily
welcome
but
as
it
is
this
is
no
place
for
a
sick
man
and
those
that
say
different
don
t
know
what
they
are
talking
about
that
s
a
real
careful
young
man
who
s
going
to
take
you
along
in
the
he
ll
get
you
there
safe
if
any
one
what
i
say
is
her
husband
protested
sullenly
that
we
ought
to
wait
for
the
doctor
s
orders
i
m
against
seeing
a
poor
body
like
that
jolted
across
the
country
in
an
open
in
his
state
i
m
not
sure
that
it
s
for
his
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
i
should
like
to
know
the
woman
demanded
sharply
you
get
and
begin
moving
the
furniture
from
where
the
rain
s
coming
sopping
in
and
if
so
be
you
can
remember
while
you
do
it
that
this
is
a
judgment
that
s
come
upon
us
why
so
much
the
better
we
are
all
of
us
though
them
as
likes
the
easy
ways
generally
manage
to
forget
the
man
retreated
silently
the
woman
sat
down
upon
a
stool
and
waited
gerald
sat
opposite
to
her
the
battered
upon
his
knees
between
them
was
stretched
the
body
of
the
unconscious
man
are
you
used
to
prayer
young
sir
the
woman
asked
gerald
shook
his
head
and
the
woman
did
not
pursue
the
subject
only
once
her
eyes
were
half
closed
and
her
words
drifted
across
the
room
the
lord
have
mercy
on
this
man
a
sinner
chapter
iv
my
advice
to
you
sir
is
to
chuck
it
gerald
turned
towards
the
chauffeur
by
whose
side
he
was
seated
a
little
stiffly
for
his
limbs
were
numbed
with
the
cold
and
exhaustion
the
morning
had
broken
with
a
grey
and
uncertain
light
a
vaporous
veil
of
mist
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
the
darkness
even
from
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
car
had
come
to
a
standstill
there
was
little
to
be
seen
we
must
have
come
forty
miles
already
the
chauffeur
continued
what
with
going
out
of
our
way
all
the
time
because
of
the
broken
bridges
i
m
pretty
well
frozen
through
and
as
for
him
he
added
jerking
his
thumb
across
his
shoulder
it
seems
to
me
you
re
taking
a
bit
of
a
the
doctor
said
he
would
remain
in
exactly
the
same
condition
for
hours
gerald
declared
yes
but
he
didn
t
say
anything
about
shaking
him
up
over
forty
miles
of
rough
road
the
other
protested
you
ll
excuse
me
sir
he
continued
in
a
slightly
changed
tone
it
isn
t
my
business
of
course
but
i
m
fairly
done
it
don
t
seem
reasonable
to
stick
at
it
like
this
there
s
holt
village
not
a
mile
away
and
a
comfortable
inn
and
a
fire
waiting
i
thought
that
was
as
far
as
you
wanted
to
come
we
might
lie
up
there
for
a
few
hours
at
any
his
passenger
slipped
down
from
his
place
and
lifting
the
rug
peered
into
the
tonneau
of
the
car
over
which
they
had
tied
a
hood
to
all
appearance
the
condition
of
the
man
who
lay
there
was
unchanged
there
was
a
slightly
added
blueness
about
the
lips
but
his
breathing
was
still
perceptible
it
seemed
even
a
little
stronger
gerald
resumed
his
seat
it
isn
t
worth
while
to
stay
at
holt
he
said
quietly
we
are
scarcely
seven
miles
from
home
now
sit
still
for
a
few
minutes
and
get
your
only
seven
miles
the
chauffeur
repeated
more
cheerfully
that
s
something
and
all
towards
the
sea
then
straight
to
the
sea
gerald
told
him
the
place
we
are
making
for
is
david
s
hall
near
the
chauffeur
seemed
a
little
startled
why
that
s
squire
fentolin
s
house
gerald
nodded
that
is
where
we
are
going
you
follow
this
road
almost
straight
the
chauffeur
slipped
in
the
clutch
oh
i
know
the
way
now
sir
right
enough
he
exclaimed
there
s
salthouse
marsh
to
cross
though
i
don
t
know
about
we
shall
manage
that
all
right
gerald
declared
we
ve
more
light
now
they
both
looked
around
during
the
last
few
minutes
the
late
morning
seemed
to
have
forced
its
way
through
the
clouds
they
had
a
dim
phantasmagoric
view
of
the
stricken
country
a
watery
plain
with
here
and
there
great
patches
of
fields
submerged
to
the
hedges
and
houses
standing
out
amidst
the
waste
of
waters
like
toy
dwellings
there
were
whole
plantations
of
uprooted
trees
close
to
the
road
on
their
left
was
a
roofless
house
and
a
family
of
children
crying
underneath
a
tarpaulin
shelter
as
they
crept
on
the
wind
came
to
them
with
a
brackish
flavour
salt
with
the
sea
the
chauffeur
was
gazing
ahead
doubtfully
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
the
marsh
he
grumbled
can
t
see
the
road
at
all
however
here
another
gerald
assured
him
encouragingly
and
we
shall
be
at
david
s
hall
you
can
have
as
much
rest
as
you
like
they
were
facing
the
wind
now
and
conversation
became
impossible
twice
they
had
to
pull
up
sharp
and
make
a
considerable
detour
once
on
account
of
a
fallen
tree
which
blocked
the
road
and
another
time
because
of
the
yawning
gap
where
a
bridge
had
fallen
away
gerald
however
knew
every
inch
of
the
country
they
were
in
and
was
able
to
give
the
necessary
directions
they
began
to
meet
farm
wagons
now
full
of
people
who
had
been
driven
from
their
homes
warnings
and
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
roads
were
shouted
to
them
continually
presently
they
came
to
the
last
steep
descent
and
emerged
from
the
devastated
fragment
of
a
wood
almost
on
to
the
sea
level
the
chauffeur
clapped
on
his
brakes
and
stopped
short
my
god
he
exclaimed
here
s
more
trouble
gerald
for
a
moment
was
speechless
they
seemed
to
have
come
suddenly
upon
a
huge
plain
of
waters
an
immense
lake
reaching
as
far
as
they
could
see
on
either
side
the
road
before
them
stretched
like
a
ribbon
for
the
next
three
miles
here
and
there
it
disappeared
and
reappeared
again
in
many
places
it
was
lapped
by
little
waves
everywhere
the
hedges
were
either
altogether
or
half
under
water
in
the
distance
was
one
farmhouse
only
the
roof
of
which
was
visible
and
from
which
the
inhabitants
were
clambering
into
a
boat
and
beyond
with
scarcely
a
break
save
for
the
rising
of
one
hill
was
the

gerald
pointed
with
his
finger
there
s
david
s
hall
he
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
the
road
seems
all
does
it
the
chauffeur
grunted
it
s
under
water
more
than
half
the
way
and
heaven
knows
how
deep
it
is
at
the
sides
i
m
not
going
to
risk
my
life
along
there
i
am
going
to
take
the
car
back
to
his
hand

already
upon
the
reverse
lever
but
gerald
gripped
it
look
here
he
protested
we
haven
t
come
all
this
way
to
turn
back
you
don
t
look
like
a
i
am
not
a
coward
sir
was
the
quiet
answer
neither
am
i
a
fool
i
don
t
see
any
use
in
risking
our
lives
and
my
master
s
because
you
want
to
get
naturally
gerald
answered
calmly
but
remember
this
i
am
responsible
for
your
car
not
you
fentolin

my
the
chauffeur
nodded
shortly
you
re
gerald
fentolin
aren
t
you
sir
he
remarked
i
thought
i
recognised
i
am
gerald
admitted
we
ve
had
a
rough
journey
but
it
doesn
t
seem
sense
to
turn
back
now
does
it
with
the
house
in
sight
that
s
all
very
well
sir
the
chauffeur
objected
doubtfully
but
i
don
t
believe
the
road
s
even
passable
and
the
floods
seem
to
me
to
be
try
it
the
young
man
begged
look
here
i
don
t
want
to
bribe
you
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
know
you
re
coming
out
of
this
well
it
s
a
serious
matter
for
me
and
i
shan
t
be
likely
to
forget
it
i
want
to
take
this
gentleman
to
david
s
hall
and
not
to
a
hospital
you
ve
brought
me
here
so
far
like
a
man
let
s
go
through
with
it
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
we
can
both
swim
i
suppose
and
we
are
not
likely
to
get
out
of
our
the
chauffeur
moved
his
head
backwards
how
about
him
he
must
take
his
chance
gerald
replied
he
s
all
right
where
he
is
the
car
won
t
upset
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
ll
see
if
we
get
into
trouble
come
let
s
make
a
dash
for
the
chauffeur
thrust
in
his
clutch
and
settled
himself
down
they
glided
off
along
that
winding
stretch
of
road
to
its
very
edge
on
either
side
of
them
so
close
that
they
could
almost
touch
it
came
the
water
water
which
stretched
as
far
as
they
could
see
swaying
waveless
even
gerald
after
his
first
impulse
of
wonder
kept
his
eyes
averted
and
fixed
upon
the
road
ahead
soon
they
reached
a
place
where
the
water
met
in
front
there
were
only
the
rows
of
white
palings
on
either
side
to
guide
them
the
chauffeur
muttered
to
himself
as
he
changed
to
his
first
speed
if
the
engine
gets
stopped
he
said
i
don
t
know
how
we
shall
get
out
of
they
emerged
on
the
other
side
for
some
time
they
had
a
clear
run
then
suddenly
the
driver
clapped
on
his
brakes
my
god
he
cried
we
can
t
get
through
that
in
front
of
them
for
more
than
a
hundred
yards
the
water
seemed
suddenly
to
have
flowed
across
the
road
still
a
mile
distant
perched
on
a
ridge
of
that
hill
was
their
destination
it
can
t
be
done
sir
the
man
groaned
there
isn
t
a
car
ever
built
could
get
through
that
see
it
s
nearly
up
to
the
top
of
those
posts
i
must
put
her
in
the
reverse
and
get
back
even
if
we
have
to
wait
on
the
higher
part
of
the
road
for
a
he
glanced
behind
and
a
second
cry
broke
from
his
lips
gerald
stood
up
in
his
place
already
the
road
which
had
been
clear
a
few
minutes
before
was
hidden
the
water
was
washing
almost
over
the
tops
of
the
white
posts
behind
them
little
waves
were
breaking
against
the
summit
of
the
raised
bank
we
re
cut
off
the
chauffeur
exclaimed
what
a
fool
i
was
to
try
this
there
s
the
tide
coming
in
as
well
gerald
sat
down
in
his
place
look
here
he
said
we
can
t
go
back
whether
we
want
to
or
not
it
s
much
worse
behind
there
than
it
is
in
front
there
s
only
one
chance
go
for
it
straight
ahead
in
your
first
speed
it
may
not
stop
the
engine
in
any
case
it
will
be
worse
presently
there
s
no
use
funking
it
if
the
worst
happens
we
can
sit
in
the
car
the
water
won
t
be
above
our
heads
and
there
are
some
boats
about
blow
your
horn
well
first
in
case
there
s
any
one
within
hearing
and
then
go
for
the
chauffeur
obeyed
they
hissed
and
spluttered
into
the
water
soon
all
trace
of
the
road
was
completely
lost
they
steered
only
by
the
tops
of
the
white
posts
it
s
getting
deeper
the
man
declared
it
s
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
bonnet
now
hold
a
wave
broke
almost
over
them
but
the
engine
continued
its
beat
if
we
stop
now
he
gasped
we
re
done
the
engine
began
to
knock
stick
at
it
gerald
cried
rising
in
his
place
a
little
look
there
s
only
one
post
lower
than
the
last
one
that
we
passed
they
get
higher
all
the
time
ahead
you
can
almost
see
the
road
in
front
there
now
in
with
your
gear
again
and
stick
at
another
wave
broke
this
time
completely
over
them
they
listened
with
strained
ears
the
engine
continued
to
beat
they
still
moved
slowly
then
there
was
a
shock
the
wheel
had
struck
something
in
the
road
a
great
stone
or
rock
the
chauffeur
thrust
the
car
out
of
gear
the
engine
still
beat
gerald
leaped
from
the
car
the
water
was
over
his
knees
he
crossed
in
front
of
the
bonnet
and
stooped
down
i
ve
got
it
he
exclaimed
tugging
hard
it
s
a
he
moved
it
rolled
it
on
one
side
and
pushed
at
the
wheel
of
the
car
as
his
companion
put
in
the
speed
they
started
again
he
jumped
back
his
place
we
ve
done
it
all
right
he
cried
don
t
you
see
it
s
getting
lower
all
the
the
chauffeur
had
lost
his
nerve
his
cheeks
were
pale
his
teeth
were
chattering
the
engine
however
was
still
beating
gradually
the
pressure
of
the
water
grew
less
in
front
of
them
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
road
they
drew
up
at
the
top
of
a
little
bridge
over
one
of
the
dikes
gerald
uttered
a
brief
exclamation
of
triumph
we
re
safe
he
almost
sobbed
there
s
the
road
straight
ahead
and
round
to
the
right
there
s
no
more
water
anywhere
they
had
left
the
main
part
of
the
flood
behind
them
there
were
still
great
pools
in
the
side
of
the
road
and
huge
masses
of
seaweed
had
been
carried
up
and
were
lying
in
their
track
there
was
no
more
water
however
at
every
moment
they
drew
nearer
to
the
hill
with
its
crown
of
trees
the
house
is
on
the
other
side
gerald
pointed
out
we
can
go
through
the
lodge
gates
at
the
back
here
the
ascent
isn
t
so
they
turned
sharply
to
the
right
along
another
stretch
of
straight
road
set
with
white
posts
ending
before
a
red
brick
lodge
and
a
closed
gate
they
blew
the
horn
and
a
gardener
came
out
he
gazed
at
them
in
amazement
it
s
all
right
gerald
cried
let
us
through
quickly
foulds
we
ve
a
gentleman
in
behind
who
s
the
man
swung
open
the
gate
with
a
respectful
salute
they
made
their
way
up
a
winding
drive
of
considerable
length
and
at
last
they
came
to
a
broad
open
space
almost
like
a
platform
on
their
left
were
the
marshes
and
beyond
the
sea
along
their
right
stretched
the
long
front
of
an
elizabethan
mansion
they
drew
up
in
front
of
the
hall
door
their
coming
had
been
observed
and
servants
were
already
waiting
gerald
sprang
to
the
ground
there
s
a
gentleman
in
behind
who
s
ill
he
explained
to
the
butler
he
has
met
with
an
accident
on
the
way
three
or
four
of
you
had
better
carry
him
up
to
a
bedroom
any
one
that
is
ready
and
you
george
he
added
turning
to
a
boy
get
into
the
car
and
show
this
man
the
way
round
to
the
garage
and
then
take
him
to
the
servants
several
of
the
servants
hastened
to
do
his
bidding
and
gerald
did
his
best
to
answer
the
eager
but
respectful
stream
of
questions
and
then
just
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
lifting
the
still
unconscious
man
on
to
the
floor
of
the
hall
came
a
queer
sound
a
shrill
reverberating
whistle
they
all
looked
up
the
stairs
the
master
is
awake
henderson
the
butler
remarked
dropping
his
voice
a
little
gerald
nodded
i
will
go
to
him
at
once
he
said
chapter
v
accustomed
though
he
was
to
the
sight
which
he
was
about
to
face
gerald
shivered
slightly
as
he
opened
the
door
of
fentolin
s
room
a
strange
sort
of
fear
seemed
to
have
crept
into
his
bearing
and
expression
a
fear
of
which
there
had
been
no
traces
whatever
during
those
terrible
hours
through
which
he
had
passed
not
even
during
that
last
reckless
journey
across
the
marshes
he
walked
with
hesitating
footsteps
across
the
spacious
and
lofty
room
he
had
the
air
of
some
frightened
creature
approaching
his
master
yet
all
that
was
visible
of
the
despot
who
ruled
his
whole
household
in
deadly
fear
was
the
kindly
and
beautiful
face
of
an
elderly
man
whose
stunted
limbs
and
body
were
mercifully
concealed
he
sat
in
a
little
carriage
with
a
rug
drawn
closely
across
his
chest
and
up
to
his
armpits
his
beautifully
shaped
hands
were
exposed
and
his
face
nothing
else
his
hair
was
a
silvery
white
his
complexion
pallid
entirely
colourless
his
eyes
were
a
soft
shade
of
blue
his
features
were
so
finely
cut
and
chiselled
that
they
resembled
some
exquisite
piece
of
statuary
he
smiled
as
his
nephew
came
slowly
towards
him
one
might
almost
have
fancied
that
the
young
man
s
abject
state
was
a
source
of
pleasure
to
him
so
you
are
back
again
my
dear
gerald
a
pleasant
surprise
indeed
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
and
what
of
my
little
commission
eh
the
young
man
s
face
was
dark
and
sullen
he
spoke
quickly
but
without
any
sign
of
eagerness
or
interest
in
the
information
he
vouchsafed
the
storm
has
stopped
all
the
trains
he
said
the
boat
did
not
cross
last
night
and
in
any
case
i
couldn
t
have
reached
harwich
as
for
your
commission
i
travelled
down
from
london
alone
with
the
man
you
told
me
to
spy
upon
i
could
have
stolen
anything
he
had
if
i
had
been
used
to
the
work
as
it
was
i
brought
the
man
fentolin
s
delicate
fingers
played
with
the
handle
of
his
chair
the
smile
had
passed
from
his
lips
he
looked
at
his
nephew
in
gentle
bewilderment
my
dear
boy
he
protested
come
come
be
careful
what
you
are
saying
you
have
brought
the
man
himself
so
far
as
my
information
goes
john
dunster
is
charged
with
a
very
important
diplomatic
commission
he
is
on
his
way
to
cologne
and
from
what
i
know
about
the
man
i
think
that
it
would
require
more
than
your
persuasions
to
induce
him
to
break
off
his
journey
you
do
not
really
wish
me
to
believe
that
you
have
brought
him
here
as
a
guest
i
was
at
liverpool
street
station
last
night
gerald
declared
i
had
no
idea
how
to
accost
him
and
as
to
stealing
any
of
his
belongings
i
couldn
t
have
done
it
you
must
hear
how
fortune
helped
me
though
dunster
missed
the
train
so
did
i
purposely
he
ordered
a
special
i
asked
permission
to
travel
with
him
i
told
him
a
lie
as
to
how
i
had
missed
the
train
i
hated
it
but
it
was
fentolin
nodded
approvingly
my
dear
boy
he
said
to
trifle
with
the
truth
is
always
unpleasant
besides
you
are
a
fentolin
and
our
love
of
truth
is
proverbial
but
there
are
times
you
know
when
for
the
good
of
others
we
must
sacrifice
our
scruples
so
you
told
dunster
a
he
let
me
travel
with
him
gerald
continued
we
were
all
night
getting
about
here
then
you
know
about
the
storm
i
suppose
fentolin
spread
out
his
hands
could
one
avoid
the
knowledge
of
it
he
asked
such
a
sight
has
never
been
we
found
we
couldn
t
get
to
harwich
gerald
went
on
they
telegraphed
to
london
and
got
permission
to
bring
us
to
yarmouth
we
were
on
our
way
to
norwich
and
the
train
ran
off
the
an
accident
fentolin
exclaimed
gerald
nodded
our
train
ran
off
the
line
and
pitched
down
an
embankment
dunster
has
concussion
of
the
brain
he
and
i
were
taken
to
a
miserable
little
inn
near
wymondham
from
there
i
hired
a
and
brought
him
you
hired
a
and
brought
him
here
fentolin
repeated
softly
my
dear
boy
forgive
me
if
i
find
this
a
little
hard
to
understand
you
say
that
you
have
brought
him
here
had
he
nothing
to
say
about
it
he
was
unconscious
when
we
picked
him
up
gerald
explained
he
is
unconscious
now
the
doctor
said
he
would
remain
so
for
at
least
hours
and
it
didn
t
seem
to
me
that
the
journey
would
do
him
any
particular
harm
the
roof
had
been
stripped
off
the
inn
where
we
were
and
the
place
was
quite
uninhabitable
so
we
should
have
had
to
have
moved
him
somewhere
we
put
him
in
the
tonneau
of
the
car
and
covered
him
up
they
have
carried
him
now
into
a
bedroom
and
sarson
is
looking
after
fentolin
sat
quite
silent
his
eyes
blinked
once
or
twice
and
there
was
a
curious
curve
about
his
lips
you
have
done
well
my
boy
he
pronounced
slowly
your
scheme
of
bringing
him
here
sounds
a
little
primitive
but
success
justifies
fentolin
raised
to
his
lips
and
blew
softly
a
little
gold
whistle
which
hung
from
a
chain
attached
to
his
waistcoat
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
a
man
entered
dressed
somberly
in
black
whose
bearing
and
demeanour
alike
denoted
the
servant
but
whose
physique
was
the
physique
of
a
he
was
scarcely
more
than
five
feet
six
in
height
but
his
shoulders
were
extraordinarily
broad
he
had
a
short
bull
neck
and
long
mighty
arms
his
face
with
the
heavy
jaw
and
small
eyes
was
the
face
of
the
typical
fighting
man
yet
his
features
seemed
to
have
become
disposed
by
habit
into
an
expression
of
gentle
almost
servile
civility
meekins
fentolin
said
a
visitor
has
arrived
do
you
happen
to
have
noticed
what
luggage
he
brought
there
is
one
small
sir
the
man
replied
nothing
else
that
i
have
that
is
all
we
brought
gerald
interposed
you
will
bring
the
here
at
once
fentolin
directed
and
also
my
compliments
to
doctor
sarson
and
any
or
papers
which
may
help
us
to
send
a
message
to
the
gentleman
s
meekins
closed
the
door
and
departed
fentolin
turned
back
towards
his
nephew
my
dear
boy
he
said
tell
me
why
you
look
as
though
there
were
ghosts
flitting
about
the
room
you
are
not
ill
i
trust
tired
perhaps
gerald
answered
shortly
we
were
many
hours
in
the
car
i
have
had
no
fentolin
s
face
was
full
of
kindly
sympathy
my
dear
fellow
he
exclaimed
i
am
selfish
indeed
i
should
not
have
kept
you
here
for
a
moment
you
had
better
go
and
lie
i
ll
go
directly
gerald
promised
can
i
speak
to
you
for
one
moment
first
speak
to
me
fentolin
repeated
a
little
wonderingly
my
dear
gerald
is
there
ever
a
moment
when
i
am
not
wholly
at
your
service
that
fellow
dunster
on
the
platform
the
first
moment
i
spoke
to
him
made
me
feel
like
a
cur
the
boy
said
with
a
sudden
access
of
vigour
in
his
tone
i
told
him
i
was
on
my
way
to
a
golf
tournament
and
he
pointed
to
the
news
about
the
war
is
it
true
uncle
that
we
may
be
at
war
at
any
moment
fentolin
sighed
a
terrible
reflection
my
dear
boy
he
admitted
softly
but
alas
the
finger
of
probability
points
that
then
what
about
me
gerald
exclaimed
i
don
t
want
to
complain
but
listen
you
dragged
me
home
from
a
public
school
before
i
could
even
join
my
cadet
corps
you
ve
kept
me
banging
around
here
with
a
tutor
you
wouldn
t
let
me
go
to
the
university
you
ve
stopped
my
entering
either
of
the
services
i
am
nineteen
years
old
and
useless
do
you
know
what
i
should
do
if
war
broke
out
enlist
it
s
the
only
thing
left
for
fentolin
was
shocked
my
dear
boy
he
exclaimed
you
must
not
talk
like
that
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
would
break
your
mother
s
heart
enlist
indeed
nothing
of
the
sort
you
are
part
of
the
civilian
population
of
the
civilian
population
be
d
d
the
boy
suddenly
cried
white
with
rage
uncle
forgive
me
i
have
stood
all
i
can
bear
if
you
won
t
let
me
go
in
for
the
army
i
could
pass
my
exams
i
m
off
i
ll
enlist
without
waiting
for
the
war
i
can
t
bear
this
idle
life
any
fentolin
leaned
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
gerald
he
said
softly
the
boy
turned
his
head
turned
it
unwillingly
he
had
the
air
of
a
caged
animal
obeying
the
word
of
his
keeper
a
certain
savage
uncouthness
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
during
the
last
few
minutes
there
was
something
almost
like
a
snarl
in
his
expression
gerald
fentolin
repeated
then
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
something
between
those
two
some
memory
or
some
living
thing
seldom
if
ever
to
be
spoken
of
and
yet
always
present
the
boy
began
to
tremble
you
re
a
little
overwrought
gerald
fentolin
declared
sit
quietly
in
my
for
a
few
moments
wait
until
i
have
examined
dunster
s
belongings
ah
meekins
has
been
prompt
there
was
a
stealthy
tap
at
the
door
meekins
entered
with
the
small
in
his
hand
he
brought
it
over
to
his
master
s
chair
fentolin
pointed
to
the
floor
open
it
there
meekins
he
directed
i
fancy
that
the
you
are
carrying
will
prove
more
interesting
we
will
just
glance
through
the
first
thank
you
yes
you
can
lay
the
things
upon
the
floor
a
man
of
life
i
should
imagine
dunster
a
spare
toothbrush
though
i
am
glad
to
see
pyjamas
of
most
unattractive
pattern
and
what
a
taste
in
shirts
nothing
but
wearing
apparel
and
singularly
little
of
that
i
the
was
empty
its
contents
upon
the
floor
fentolin
held
out
his
hand
and
took
the
which
meekins
had
been
carrying
it
was
an
ordinary
morocco
affair
similar
to
those
issued
by
american
banking
houses
to
enclose
letters
of
credit
one
side
of
it
was
filled
with
notes
fentolin
withdrew
them
and
glanced
them
through
dear
me
he
murmured
no
wonder
our
friend
engages
special
trains
he
travels
like
a
prince
indeed
two
thousand
pounds
or
near
it
in
this
little
compartment
and
here
i
see
a
letter
a
sealed
letter
with
no
he
held
it
out
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
long
commercial
envelope
of
ordinary
type
and
although
the
flap
was
secured
with
a
blob
of
sealing
wax
there
was
no
particular
impression
upon
it
we
can
match
this
envelope
i
think
fentolin
said
softly
the
seal
we
can
copy
i
think
that
for
the
sake
of
others
we
must
discover
the
cause
for
this
hurried
journey
on
the
part
of
john
with
his
long
delicate
forefinger
fentolin
slit
the
envelope
and
withdrew
the
single
sheet
of
paper
which
it
contained
there
were
a
dozen
lines
of
written
matter
and
what
appeared
to
be
a
dozen
signatures
appended
fentolin
read
it
at
first
with
ordinary
interest
then
a
change
came
the
look
of
a
man
drawn
out
of
himself
drawn
out
of
all
knowledge
of
his
surroundings
or
his
present
state
stole
into
his
face
literally
he
became
transfixed
the
delicate
fingers
of
his
left
hand
gripped
the
sides
of
his
little
carriage
his
eyes
shone
as
though
those
few
written
lines
upon
which
they
were
riveted
were
indeed
some
message
from
an
unknown
an
unimagined
world
yet
no
word
ever
passed
his
lips
there
came
a
time
when
the
tension
seemed
a
little
relaxed
with
fingers
which
still
trembled
he
folded
up
the
sheet
and
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
he
guarded
it
with
both
his
hands
and
sat
quite
still
neither
gerald
nor
his
servant
moved
somehow
the
sense
of
fentolin
s
suppressed
excitement
seemed
to
have
become
communicated
to
them
it
was
a
little
tableau
broken
at
last
by
fentolin
himself
i
should
like
he
said
turning
to
gerald
to
be
alone
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
this
document
which
dunster
has
brought
across
the
seas
and
which
i
hold
in
my
hands
is
the
most
amazing
message
of
modern
gerald
rose
to
his
feet
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
asked
abruptly
do
you
want
any
one
in
from
the
telegraph
room
fentolin
shook
his
head
slowly
at
present
he
announced
i
am
going
to
reflect
meekins
my
chair
to
the
north
window
so
i
am
going
to
sit
here
he
went
on
and
i
am
going
to
look
across
the
sea
and
reflect
a
very
fortunate
storm
after
all
i
think
which
kept
john
dunster
from
the
harwich
boat
last
night
leave
me
gerald
for
a
time
stand
behind
my
chair
meekins
and
see
that
no
one
fentolin
sat
in
his
chair
his
hands
still
gripping
the
wonderful
document
his
eyes
travelling
over
the
ocean
now
flecked
with
sunlight
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
horizon
he
looked
steadily
eastward
chapter
vi
john
dunster
opened
his
eyes
upon
strange
surroundings
he
found
himself
lying
upon
a
bed
deliciously
soft
with
sheets
and
bed
hangings
through
the
discreetly
opened
upper
window
came
a
pleasant
and
breeze
the
furniture
in
the
room
was
mostly
of
an
type
some
of
it
of
oak
curiously
carved
and
most
of
it
surmounted
with
a
coat
of
arms
the
apartment
was
lofty
and
of
almost
palatial
proportions
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
breathed
comfort
and
refinement
the
only
thing
of
which
he
did
not
wholly
approve
was
the
face
of
the
nurse
who
rose
silently
to
her
feet
at
his
murmured
question
where
am
i
she
felt
his
forehead
altered
a
bandage
for
a
moment
and
took
his
wrist
between
her
fingers
you
have
been
ill
she
said
there
was
a
railway
accident
you
are
to
lie
quite
still
and
not
say
a
word
i
am
going
to
fetch
the
doctor
now
he
wished
to
see
you
directly
you
dunster
dozed
again
for
several
moments
when
he
reopened
his
eyes
a
man
was
standing
by
his
bedside
a
short
man
with
a
black
beard
and
glasses
dunster
in
this
first
stage
of
his
convalescence
was
perhaps
difficult
to
please
for
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
doctor
either
please
tell
me
where
i
am
he
begged
you
have
been
in
a
railway
accident
the
doctor
told
him
and
you
were
brought
here
in
a
railway
accident
dunster
repeated
ah
yes
i
remember
i
took
a
special
to
harwich
i
remember
now
where
is
my
it
is
here
by
the
side
of
your
and
my
it
is
on
your
have
any
of
my
things
been
looked
at
only
so
far
as
was
necessary
to
discover
your
identity
the
doctor
assured
him
don
t
talk
too
much
the
nurse
is
bringing
you
some
beef
when
dunster
enquired
shall
i
be
able
to
continue
my
journey
that
depends
upon
many
things
the
doctor
replied
dunster
drank
his
beef
tea
and
felt
considerably
stronger
his
head
still
ached
but
his
memory
was
returning
there
was
a
young
man
in
the
carriage
with
me
he
asked
presently
mr
gerald
something
or
other
i
think
he
said
his
name
was
fentolin
the
doctor
said
he
is
unhurt
this
is
his
relative
s
house
to
which
you
have
been
dunster
lay
for
a
time
with
knitted
brows
once
more
the
name
of
fentolin
seemed
somehow
familiar
to
him
seemed
somehow
to
bring
with
it
to
his
memory
a
note
of
warning
he
looked
around
the
room
fretfully
he
looked
into
the
nurse
s
face
which
he
disliked
exceedingly
and
he
looked
at
the
doctor
whom
he
was
beginning
to
detest
whose
house
exactly
is
this
he
demanded
this
is
david
s
hall
the
home
of
mr
miles
fentolin
the
doctor
told
him
the
young
gentleman
with
whom
you
were
travelling
is
his
can
i
send
a
telegram
dunster
asked
a
little
abruptly
without
a
doubt
the
doctor
replied
mr
fentolin
desired
me
to
ask
you
if
there
was
any
one
whom
you
would
like
to
apprise
of
your
again
the
man
upon
the
bed
lay
quite
still
with
knitted
brows
there
was
surely
something
familiar
about
that
name
was
it
his
fevered
fancy
or
was
there
also
something
a
little
sinister
the
nurse
who
had
glided
from
the
room
came
back
presently
with
some
telegraph
forms
dunster
held
out
his
hand
for
them
and
then
hesitated
can
you
tell
me
any
date
doctor
upon
which
i
can
rely
upon
leaving
here
you
will
probably
be
well
enough
to
travel
on
the
third
day
from
now
the
doctor
assured
him
the
third
day
dunster
muttered
very
he
wrote
out
three
telegrams
and
passed
them
over
one
he
said
is
to
new
york
one
to
the
hague
and
one
to
london
there
was
plenty
of
money
in
my
pocket
perhaps
you
will
find
it
and
pay
for
is
there
anything
more
the
doctor
asked
that
can
be
done
for
your
comfort
nothing
at
present
dunster
replied
my
head
aches
now
but
i
think
that
i
shall
want
to
leave
before
three
days
are
up
are
you
the
doctor
in
the
neighbourhood
sarson
shook
his
head
i
am
physician
to
fentolin
s
household
he
answered
quietly
i
live
here
fentolin
is
himself
somewhat
of
an
invalid
and
requires
constant
medical
dunster
contemplated
the
speaker
steadfastly
you
will
forgive
me
he
said
i
am
an
american
and
i
am
used
to
plain
speech
i
am
quite
unused
to
being
attended
by
strange
doctors
i
understand
that
you
are
not
in
general
practice
now
might
i
ask
if
you
are
fully
qualified
i
am
an
of
london
the
doctor
replied
you
can
make
yourself
quite
easy
as
to
my
qualifications
it
would
not
suit
fentolin
s
purpose
to
entrust
himself
to
the
care
of
any
one
without
a
he
left
the
room
and
dunster
closed
his
eyes
his
slumbers
however
were
not
altogether
peaceful
ones
all
the
time
there
seemed
to
be
a
hammering
inside
his
head
and
from
somewhere
back
in
his
obscured
memory
the
name
of
fentolin
seemed
to
be
continually
asserting
itself
from
somewhere
or
other
the
amazing
sense
which
sometimes
gives
warning
of
danger
to
men
of
adventure
seemed
to
have
opened
its
feelers
he
rested
because
he
was
exhausted
but
even
in
his
sleep
he
was
ill
at
ease
the
doctor
with
the
telegrams
in
his
hand
made
his
way
down
a
splendid
staircase
past
the
long
picture
gallery
where
masterpieces
of
van
dyck
and
rubens
frowned
and
leered
down
upon
him
descended
the
final
stretch
of
broad
oak
stairs
crossed
the
hall
and
entered
his
master
s
rooms
fentolin
was
sitting
before
the
open
window
an
easel
in
front
of
him
a
palette
in
his
left
hand
painting
with
deft
swift
touches
ah
he
exclaimed
without
looking
around
it
is
my
friend
the
doctor
my
friend
sarson
of
london
and
all
the
rest
of
it
he
brings
with
him
the
odour
of
the
sick
room
for
a
moment
or
two
just
for
a
moment
dear
friend
do
not
disturb
me
do
not
bring
any
alien
thoughts
into
my
brain
i
am
absorbed
you
see
absorbed
it
is
a
strange
problem
of
colour
he
was
silent
for
several
moments
glancing
repeatedly
out
of
the
window
and
back
to
his
canvas
painting
all
the
time
with
swift
and
delicate
precision
meekins
who
stands
behind
my
chair
fentolin
continued
even
meekins
is
entranced
he
has
a
soul
my
friend
sarson
although
you
might
not
think
it
he
too
sees
sometimes
the
colour
in
the
skies
the
glitter
upon
the
sands
the
clear
sweet
purity
of
those
long
stretches
of
virgin
water
meekins
i
believe
has
a
soul
only
he
likes
better
to
see
these
things
grow
under
his
master
s
touch
than
to
wander
about
and
solve
their
riddles
for
the
man
remained
perfectly
immovable
not
a
feature
twitched
yet
it
was
a
fact
that
although
he
stood
where
fentolin
could
not
possibly
observe
him
he
never
removed
his
gaze
from
the
canvas
you
see
my
medical
friend
that
there
has
been
a
great
tide
in
the
night
following
upon
the
flood
even
our
small
landmarks
are
shifted
soon
in
my
little
carriage
i
shall
ride
down
to
the
tower
i
shall
sit
there
and
i
shall
watch
the
sea
i
think
that
this
evening
with
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
spray
may
reach
even
to
my
windows
there
i
shall
paint
again
there
is
always
something
fresh
in
the
sea
you
know
always
something
fresh
in
the
sea
like
a
human
face
angry
or
pleased
sullen
or
joyful
some
people
like
to
paint
the
sea
at
its
calmest
and
most
beautiful
some
people
like
to
see
happy
faces
around
them
it
is
not
every
one
who
appreciates
the
other
things
it
is
not
quite
like
that
with
me
eh
sarson
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
momentarily
he
had
finished
his
work
he
turned
around
and
eyed
the
doctor
who
stood
in
taciturn
silence
answer
answer
me
he
insisted
the
doctor
s
gloomy
face
seemed
darker
still
you
have
spoken
the
truth
fentolin
he
admitted
you
are
not
one
of
the
vulgar
herd
who
love
to
consort
with
pleasure
and
happiness
you
are
one
of
those
who
understand
the
beauty
of
unhappiness
in
others
he
added
with
faint
emphasis
fentolin
smiled
his
face
became
almost
like
the
face
of
one
of
those
angels
of
the
great
italian
master
how
well
you
know
me
he
murmured
my
humble
effort
doctor
how
do
you
like
it
the
doctor
bent
over
the
canvas
i
know
nothing
about
art
he
said
a
little
roughly
your
work
seems
to
me
clever
a
little
grotesque
perhaps
a
little
straining
after
the
hard
plain
things
which
threaten
nothing
of
the
idealist
in
your
work
fentolin
studied
the
canvas
himself
for
a
moment
a
clever
man
sarson
he
remarked
coolly
but
no
courtier
never
mind
my
work
pleases
me
it
gives
me
a
passing
sensation
of
happiness
now
what
about
our
patient
he
recovers
the
doctor
pronounced
from
my
short
examination
i
should
say
that
he
had
the
constitution
of
an
ox
i
have
told
him
that
he
will
be
up
in
three
days
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
will
be
able
if
he
wants
to
to
walk
out
of
the
house
fentolin
shook
his
head
we
can
not
spare
him
quite
so
soon
he
declared
we
must
avail
ourselves
of
this
wonderful
chance
afforded
us
by
my
brilliant
young
nephew
we
must
keep
him
with
us
for
a
little
time
what
is
it
that
you
have
in
your
hands
doctor
telegrams
i
think
let
me
look
at
the
doctor
held
them
out
fentolin
took
them
eagerly
between
his
thin
delicate
fingers
suddenly
his
face
darkened
and
became
like
the
face
of
a
spoilt
and
angry
child
cipher
he
exclaimed
furiously
a
cipher
which
he
knows
so
well
as
to
remember
it
too
never
mind
it
will
be
easy
to
decode
it
will
amuse
me
during
the
afternoon
very
good
sarson
i
will
take
charge
of
you
do
not
wish
anything
dispatched
nothing
at
present
fentolin
sighed
it
will
be
well
i
think
for
the
poor
man
to
remain
undisturbed
by
any
communications
from
his
friends
is
he
restless
at
all
he
wants
to
get
on
with
his
we
shall
see
fentolin
remarked
now
feel
my
pulse
sarson
how
am
i
this
morning
the
doctor
held
the
thin
wrist
for
a
moment
between
his
fingers
and
let
it
go
in
perfect
health
as
usual
he
announced
grimly
ah
but
you
can
not
be
sure
fentolin
protested
my
tongue
if
you
he
put
it
out
excellent
we
must
make
quite
certain
fentolin
continued
there
are
so
many
people
who
would
miss
me
my
place
in
the
world
would
not
be
easily
filed
undo
my
waistcoat
sarson
feel
my
heart
please
feel
carefully
i
can
see
the
end
of
your
stethoscope
in
your
pocket
don
t
scamp
it
i
fancied
this
morning
when
i
was
lying
here
alone
that
there
was
something
almost
like
a
palpitation
a
quicker
beat
be
very
careful
sarson
the
doctor
made
his
examination
with
impassive
face
then
he
stepped
back
there
is
no
change
in
your
condition
fentolin
he
announced
the
palpitation
you
spoke
of
is
a
mistake
you
are
in
perfect
fentolin
sighed
gently
then
he
said
i
will
now
amuse
myself
by
a
gentle
ride
down
to
the
tower
you
are
entirely
satisfied
sarson
you
are
keeping
nothing
back
from
me
the
doctor
looked
at
him
with
grim
impassive
face
there
is
nothing
to
keep
back
he
declared
you
have
the
constitution
of
a
cowboy
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
live
for
another
thirty
fentolin
sighed
as
though
a
weight
had
been
removed
from
his
heart
i
will
now
he
decided
reaching
forward
for
the
handle
of
his
carriage
go
down
to
the
tower
it
is
just
possible
that
a
few
days
seclusion
might
be
good
for
our
the
doctor
turned
silently
away
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
his
expression
as
he
walked
towards
the
door
chapter
vii
the
two
men
who
were
supping
together
in
the
grillroom
at
the
cafe
milan
were
talking
with
a
seriousness
which
seemed
a
little
out
of
keeping
with
the
lamps
and
the
swaying
music
of
the
band
from
the
distant
restaurant
their
conversation
had
started
some
hours
before
in
the
club
and
had
continued
intermittently
throughout
the
evening
it
had
received
a
further
stimulus
when
richard
hamel
who
had
bought
an
evening
standard
on
their
way
from
the
theatre
a
few
minutes
ago
came
across
a
certain
paragraph
in
it
which
he
read
aloud
hanged
if
i
understand
things
over
here
nowadays
reggie
he
declared
laying
the
paper
down
here
s
another
englishman
imprisoned
in
germany
this
time
at
a
place
no
one
ever
heard
of
before
i
won
t
try
to
pronounce
it
what
does
it
all
mean
it
s
all
very
well
to
shrug
your
shoulders
but
when
there
are
eighteen
arrests
within
one
week
on
a
charge
of
espionage
there
must
be
something
for
the
first
time
reginald
kinsley
seemed
inclined
to
discuss
the
subject
seriously
he
drew
the
paper
towards
him
and
read
the
little
paragraph
word
by
word
then
he
gave
some
further
order
to
an
attentive
maitre
d
hotel
and
glanced
around
to
be
sure
that
they
were
not
overheard
look
here
dick
old
chap
he
said
you
are
just
back
from
abroad
and
you
are
not
quite
in
the
hang
of
things
yet
let
me
ask
you
a
plain
question
what
do
you
think
of
us
all
think
of
you
hamel
repeated
a
little
doubtfully
do
you
mean
personally
take
it
any
way
you
like
kinsley
replied
look
at
me
nine
years
ago
we
played
cricket
in
the
same
eleven
i
don
t
look
much
like
cricket
now
do
i
hamel
looked
at
his
companion
thoughtfully
for
a
man
who
was
doubtless
still
young
kinsley
had
certainly
an
aged
appearance
the
hair
about
his
temples
was
grey
there
were
lines
about
his
mouth
and
forehead
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
anxiety
to
me
hamel
declared
frankly
you
look
worried
if
i
hadn
t
heard
so
much
of
the
success
of
your
political
career
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
should
have
thought
that
things
were
going
badly
with
they
ve
gone
well
enough
with
me
personally
kinsley
admitted
but
i
m
only
one
of
many
politics
isn
t
the
game
it
was
the
foreign
office
especially
is
ageing
its
men
fast
these
few
years
we
ve
been
going
through
hell
hamel
and
we
are
up
against
it
now
hard
up
against
the
slight
smile
passed
from
the
lips
of
hamel
s
sunburnt
face
he
himself
seemed
to
become
infected
with
something
of
his
companion
s
anxiety
there
s
nothing
seriously
wrong
is
there
reggie
he
asked
dick
said
kinsley
with
a
sigh
i
am
afraid
there
is
it
s
very
seldom
i
talk
as
plainly
as
this
to
any
one
but
you
are
just
the
person
one
can
unburden
oneself
to
a
little
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
s
rather
a
relief
as
you
say
these
eighteen
arrests
in
one
week
do
mean
something
half
of
the
englishmen
who
have
been
arrested
are
to
my
certain
knowledge
connected
with
our
secret
service
and
they
have
been
arrested
in
many
cases
where
there
are
no
fortifications
worth
speaking
of
within
fifty
miles
on
one
pretext
or
another
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
things
are
going
on
in
germany
just
at
the
present
moment
the
knowledge
of
which
is
of
vital
interest
to
then
these
arrests
hamel
remarked
are
really
bona
fide
without
a
doubt
his
companion
agreed
i
only
wonder
there
have
not
been
more
i
am
telling
you
what
is
a
pretty
open
secret
when
i
tell
you
that
there
is
a
conference
due
to
be
held
this
week
at
some
place
or
another
on
the
continent
i
don
t
know
where
myself
which
will
have
a
very
important
bearing
upon
our
future
we
know
just
as
much
as
that
and
not
much
a
conference
between
whom
hamel
asked
kinsley
dropped
his
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
we
know
he
replied
that
a
very
great
man
from
russia
a
greater
still
from
france
a
minister
from
austria
a
statesman
from
italy
and
an
envoy
from
japan
have
been
invited
to
meet
a
german
minister
whose
name
i
will
not
mention
even
to
you
the
subject
of
their
proposed
discussion
has
never
been
breathed
one
can
only
suspect
when
i
tell
you
that
no
one
from
this
country
was
invited
to
the
conference
i
think
you
will
be
able
broadly
speaking
to
divine
its
purpose
the
clouds
have
been
gathering
for
a
good
many
years
and
we
have
only
buried
our
heads
a
little
deeper
in
the
sands
we
have
had
our
chances
and
wilfully
chucked
them
away
national
service
or
three
more
army
corps
four
years
ago
would
have
brought
us
an
alliance
which
would
have
meant
absolute
safety
for
years
you
know
what
happened
we
have
lived
through
many
rumours
and
escaped
more
narrowly
than
most
people
realise
a
great
many
dangers
but
there
is
every
indication
this
time
that
the
end
is
really
and
what
will
the
end
be
hamel
enquired
eagerly
kinsley
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
paused
while
their
glasses
were
filled
with
wine
it
will
be
in
the
nature
of
a
diplomatic
coup
he
said
presently
of
that
much
i
feel
sure
england
will
be
forced
into
such
a
position
that
she
will
have
no
alternative
left
but
to
declare
war
that
of
course
will
be
the
end
of
us
with
our
ridiculously
small
army
and
absolutely
no
sane
scheme
for
home
defence
we
shall
lose
all
that
we
have
worth
fighting
for
our
colonies
without
being
able
to
strike
a
blow
the
thing
is
so
ridiculously
obvious
it
has
been
admitted
time
after
time
by
every
sea
lord
and
every
we
have
listened
to
it
and
that
s
all
our
fleet
is
needed
under
present
conditions
to
protect
our
own
shores
there
isn
t
a
single
battleship
which
could
be
safely
spared
canada
australia
new
zealand
egypt
india
must
take
care
of
themselves
i
wonder
when
a
nation
of
the
world
ever
played
fast
and
loose
with
great
possessions
as
we
have
done
this
is
a
nice
sort
of
thing
to
hear
almost
one
s
first
night
in
england
hamel
remarked
a
little
gloomily
tell
me
some
more
about
this
conference
are
you
sure
that
your
information
is
reliable
our
information
is
miserably
scanty
kinsley
admitted
curiously
enough
the
man
who
must
know
most
about
the
whole
thing
is
an
englishman
one
of
the
most
curious
mortals
in
the
british
empire
a
spy
of
his
succeeded
in
learning
more
than
any
of
our
people
and
without
being
arrested
and
who
is
this
singular
person
hamel
asked
a
man
of
whom
you
i
suppose
never
heard
kinsley
replied
his
name
is
fentolin
miles
fentolin
and
he
lives
somewhere
down
in
norfolk
he
is
one
of
the
strangest
characters
that
ever
lived
stranger
than
any
effort
of
fiction
i
ever
met
with
he
was
in
the
foreign
office
once
and
every
one
was
predicting
for
him
a
brilliant
career
then
there
was
an
accident
let
me
see
it
must
have
been
some
six
or
seven
years
ago
and
he
had
to
have
both
his
legs
amputated
no
one
knows
exactly
how
the
accident
happened
and
there
was
always
a
certain
amount
of
mystery
connected
with
it
since
then
he
has
buried
himself
in
the
country
i
don
t
think
in
fact
that
he
ever
moves
outside
his
place
but
somehow
or
other
he
has
managed
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
the
political
movements
of
the
fentolin
hamel
repeated
softly
to
himself
tell
me
whereabouts
does
he
live
quite
a
wonderful
place
in
norfolk
i
believe
somewhere
near
the
sea
i
ve
forgotten
the
name
for
the
moment
he
has
had
wireless
telegraphy
installed
he
has
a
telegraph
office
in
the
house
private
wires
and
they
say
that
he
spends
an
immense
amount
of
money
keeping
in
touch
with
foreign
politics
his
excuse
is
that
he
speculates
largely
as
i
dare
say
he
does
but
just
lately
kinsley
went
on
more
slowly
he
has
been
an
object
of
anxiety
to
all
of
us
it
was
he
who
sent
the
first
agent
out
to
germany
to
try
and
discover
at
least
where
this
conference
was
to
be
held
his
man
returned
in
safety
and
he
has
one
over
there
now
who
has
not
been
arrested
we
seem
to
have
lost
nearly
all
of
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
man
fentolin
actually
possesses
information
which
the
government
hasn
t
as
to
the
intentions
of
foreign
powers
hamel
asked
kinsley
nodded
there
was
a
slight
flush
upon
his
pallid
cheeks
he
not
only
has
it
but
he
doesn
t
mean
to
part
with
it
a
few
hundred
years
ago
when
the
rulers
of
this
country
were
men
with
blood
in
their
veins
he
d
have
been
given
just
one
chance
to
tell
all
he
knew
and
hung
as
a
traitor
if
he
hesitated
we
don
t
do
that
sort
of
thing
nowadays
we
rather
go
in
for
preserving
traitors
we
permit
them
even
in
our
own
house
of
commons
however
i
don
t
want
to
depress
you
and
play
the
alarmist
so
soon
after
your
return
to
london
i
dare
say
the
old
country
ll
muddle
along
through
our
don
t
be
foolish
hamel
begged
there
s
no
other
subject
of
conversation
could
interest
me
half
as
much
have
you
formed
any
idea
yourself
as
to
the
nature
of
this
conference
we
all
have
an
idea
kinsley
replied
grimly
india
for
russia
a
large
slice
of
china
for
japan
with
probably
australia
thrown
in
for
france
s
neutrality
there
s
bribery
for
you
what
s
to
become
of
poor
england
then
our
friends
are
only
human
after
all
and
it
s
merely
a
question
of
handing
over
to
them
sufficient
spoil
they
must
consider
themselves
first
that
s
the
first
duty
of
their
politicians
towards
their
you
mean
to
say
hamel
asked
that
you
seriously
believe
that
a
conference
is
on
the
point
of
being
held
at
which
france
and
russia
are
to
be
invited
to
consider
suggestions
like
this
i
am
afraid
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
kinsley
declared
their
ambassadors
in
london
profess
to
know
nothing
that
of
course
is
their
reasonable
attitude
but
there
s
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
conference
has
been
planned
i
should
say
that
we
are
nearer
war
if
we
can
summon
enough
spirit
to
fight
than
we
have
been
since
queer
if
i
have
returned
just
in
time
for
the
scrap
hamel
remarked
thoughtfully
i
was
in
the
militia
once
so
i
expect
i
can
get
a
job
if
there
s
any
i
can
get
you
a
better
job
than
fighting
one
you
can
start
on
too
kinsley
announced
abruptly
that
is
if
you
really
want
to
help
of
course
i
do
hamel
insisted
i
m
on
for
you
say
that
you
are
entirely
your
own
master
for
the
next
six
months
or
as
much
longer
as
i
like
hamel
assented
no
plans
at
all
except
that
i
might
drift
round
to
the
norfolk
coast
and
look
up
some
of
the
places
where
the
governor
used
to
paint
there
s
a
queer
little
house
david
s
tower
i
believe
they
call
it
which
really
belongs
to
me
it
was
given
to
my
father
or
rather
he
bought
it
from
a
man
who
i
think
must
have
been
some
relative
of
your
friend
i
feel
sure
the
name
was
reginald
kinsley
set
down
his
is
your
david
s
tower
anywhere
near
a
place
called
salthouse
he
asked
reflectively
that
s
the
name
of
the
village
hamel
admitted
my
father
used
to
spend
quite
a
lot
of
time
in
those
parts
and
painted
at
least
a
dozen
pictures
down
this
is
a
coincidence
reginald
kinsley
declared
lighting
a
cigarette
i
think
if
i
were
you
dick
i
d
go
down
and
claim
my
tired
of
me
already
hamel
asked
smiling
reginald
kinsley
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigarette
it
isn
t
that
the
fact
is
that
job
i
was
speaking
to
you
about
was
simply
this
we
want
some
one
to
go
down
to
salthouse
not
exactly
as
a
spy
you
know
but
some
one
who
has
his
wits
about
him
we
are
all
of
us
very
curious
about
this
man
fentolin
there
are
no
end
of
rumours
which
i
won
t
mention
to
you
for
they
might
only
put
you
off
the
scent
but
the
man
seems
to
be
always
intriguing
it
wouldn
t
matter
so
much
if
he
were
our
friend
or
if
he
were
simply
a
financier
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
have
cause
to
suspect
but
he
s
an
englishman
surely
hamel
asked
the
fentolin
who
was
my
father
s
friend
was
just
a
very
wealthy
norfolk
squire
one
of
the
best
from
all
i
have
miles
fentolin
is
an
englishman
kinsley
admitted
it
is
true
too
that
he
comes
of
a
very
ancient
norfolk
family
it
doesn
t
do
however
to
build
too
much
upon
that
from
all
i
can
learn
of
him
he
is
a
sort
of
puck
a
professional
i
don
t
suppose
there
s
anything
an
outsider
could
find
out
which
would
be
really
useful
to
us
but
all
the
same
if
i
had
the
time
i
should
certainly
go
down
to
norfolk
the
conversation
drifted
away
for
a
while
mutual
acquaintances
entered
there
were
several
introductions
and
it
was
not
until
the
two
found
themselves
together
in
kinsley
s
rooms
for
a
few
minutes
before
parting
that
they
were
alone
again
hamel
returned
then
once
more
to
the
subject
reggie
he
said
if
you
think
it
would
be
of
the
slightest
use
i
ll
go
down
to
salthouse
i
am
rather
keen
on
going
there
anyway
i
am
absolutely
fed
up
with
life
here
it
s
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
kinsley
said
i
am
afraid
fentolin
is
a
little
too
clever
for
you
to
get
on
the
right
side
of
him
but
if
you
could
only
get
an
idea
as
to
what
his
game
is
down
there
it
would
be
a
great
help
you
see
the
fellow
can
t
have
gone
into
all
this
sort
of
thing
blindfold
we
ve
lost
several
very
useful
agents
abroad
and
two
from
new
york
who
ve
gone
into
his
pay
there
must
be
a
method
in
it
somewhere
if
it
really
ends
with
his
financial
operations
why
all
right
that
s
very
likely
what
it
ll
come
to
but
we
should
like
to
know
the
merest
hint
would
be
i
ll
do
my
best
hamel
promised
in
any
case
it
will
be
just
the
few
days
holiday
i
was
looking
forward
kinsley
helped
himself
to
whisky
and
soda
and
turned
towards
his
friend
here
s
luck
to
you
dick
take
care
of
yourself
all
sorts
of
things
may
happen
you
know
old
man
fentolin
may
take
a
fancy
to
you
and
tell
you
secrets
that
any
statesman
in
europe
would
be
glad
to
hear
he
may
tell
you
why
this
conference
is
being
held
and
what
the
result
will
be
you
may
be
the
first
to
hear
of
our
coming
fall
well
here
s
to
you
anyway
drop
me
a
line
if
you
ve
anything
to
cheero
hamel
answered
as
he
set
down
his
empty
tumbler
astonishing
how
keen
i
feel
about
this
little
adventure
i
m
perfectly
sick
of
the
humdrum
life
i
have
been
leading
the
last
week
and
you
do
sort
of
take
one
back
to
the
arabian
nights
you
know
reggie
i
am
never
quite
sure
whether
to
take
you
seriously
or
kinsley
smiled
as
he
held
his
friend
s
hand
for
a
moment
dick
he
said
earnestly
if
only
you
d
believe
it
the
adventures
in
the
arabian
nights
were
as
nothing
compared
with
the
drama
of
foreign
politics
you
see
we
ve
learned
to
conceal
things
nowadays
to
smooth
them
over
to
play
the
part
of
ordinary
citizens
to
the
world
while
we
tug
at
the
underhand
levers
in
our
secret
moments
good
night
good
luck
chapter
viii
richard
hamel
although
he
certainly
had
not
the
appearance
of
a
person
afflicted
with
nerves
gave
a
slight
start
for
the
last
during
which
time
the
train
had
made
no
stop
he
had
been
alone
in
his
compartment
yet
to
his
surprise
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
the
seat
opposite
to
him
had
been
noiselessly
taken
by
a
girl
whose
eyes
also
were
fixed
with
curious
intentness
upon
the
broad
expanse
of
marshland
and
sands
across
which
the
train
was
slowly
making
its
way
hamel
had
spent
a
great
many
years
abroad
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
speak
with
the
unexpected
stranger
he
forgot
for
a
moment
that
he
was
in
england
travelling
in
a
carriage
and
pointed
with
his
left
hand
towards
the
sea
queer
country
this
isn
t
it
he
remarked
pleasantly
do
you
know
i
never
heard
you
come
in
it
gave
me
quite
a
start
when
i
found
that
i
had
a
she
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
still
surprise
a
look
which
he
returned
just
as
steadfastly
because
even
in
those
few
seconds
he
was
conscious
of
that
strange
selective
interest
certainly
unaccounted
for
by
his
own
impressions
of
her
appearance
she
seemed
to
him
at
that
first
glance
very
far
indeed
from
being
according
to
any
of
the
standards
by
which
he
had
measured
good
looks
she
was
thin
too
thin
for
his
taste
and
she
carried
herself
with
an
aloofness
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
her
cheeks
were
quite
pale
her
hair
of
a
soft
shade
of
brown
her
eyes
grey
and
sad
she
gave
him
altogether
an
impression
of
colourlessness
and
he
had
been
living
in
a
land
where
colour
and
vitality
meant
much
her
speech
too
in
its
very
restraint
fell
strangely
upon
his
ears
i
have
been
travelling
in
an
uncomfortable
compartment
she
observed
i
happened
to
notice
when
passing
along
the
corridor
that
yours
was
empty
in
any
case
i
am
getting
out
at
the
next
so
am
i
he
replied
still
cheerfully
i
suppose
the
next
station
is
david
s
she
made
no
answer
but
so
far
as
her
expression
counted
for
anything
at
all
she
was
a
little
surprised
her
eyes
considered
him
for
a
moment
hamel
was
tall
well
over
six
feet
powerfully
made
with
good
features
clear
eyes
and
complexion
unusually
sunburnt
he
wore
a
flannel
collar
of
unfamiliar
shape
and
his
clothes
although
they
were
neat
enough
were
of
a
pattern
and
cut
obviously
designed
to
afford
the
maximum
of
ease
and
comfort
with
the
minimum
regard
to
appearance
he
wore
too
very
thick
boots
and
his
hands
gave
one
the
impression
that
they
were
seldom
gloved
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
he
had
the
easy
of
a
person
sure
of
himself
in
the
world
she
put
him
down
as
a
colonial
perhaps
an
american
but
his
rank
in
life
mystified
her
this
seems
the
queerest
stretch
of
country
he
went
on
long
spits
of
sand
jutting
right
out
into
the
sea
dikes
and
creeks
miles
and
miles
of
them
now
i
wonder
is
it
low
tide
or
high
low
i
should
think
because
of
the
on
the
sand
she
glanced
out
of
the
window
the
tide
she
told
him
is
almost
at
its
you
live
in
this
neighbourhood
perhaps
he
enquired
i
do
she
assented
sort
of
country
one
might
get
very
fond
of
he
ventured
she
glanced
at
him
from
the
depths
of
her
grey
eyes
do
you
think
so
she
rejoined
coldly
for
my
part
i
hate
he
was
surprised
at
the
unexpected
emphasis
of
her
tone
the
first
time
indeed
that
she
had
shown
any
signs
of
interest
in
the
conversation
kind
of
dull
i
suppose
you
find
it
he
remarked
pensively
looking
out
across
the
waste
of
marshes
sand
hummocks
piled
with
seaweed
and
a
far
distant
line
of
pebbled
shore
and
yet
i
don
t
know
i
have
lived
by
the
sea
a
good
deal
and
however
monotonous
it
may
seem
at
first
there
s
always
plenty
of
change
really
tide
and
wind
do
such
wonderful
she
too
was
looking
out
now
towards
the
sea
oh
it
isn
t
exactly
that
she
said
quietly
i
am
quite
willing
to
admit
what
all
the
tourists
and
chance
visitors
call
the
fascination
of
these
places
i
happen
to
dislike
them
that
is
all
perhaps
it
is
because
i
live
here
because
i
see
them
day
by
day
perhaps
because
the
sight
of
them
and
the
thought
of
them
have
become
woven
into
my
she
was
talking
half
to
herself
for
a
moment
even
the
knowledge
of
his
presence
had
escaped
her
hamel
however
did
not
realise
that
fact
he
welcomed
her
confidence
as
a
sign
of
relaxation
from
the
frigidity
of
her
earlier
demeanour
that
seems
hard
he
observed
sympathetically
it
seems
odd
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
too
your
life
surely
ought
to
be
pleasant
she
looked
away
from
the
sea
into
his
face
although
the
genuine
interest
which
she
saw
there
and
the
kindly
expression
of
his
eyes
disarmed
annoyance
she
still
stiffened
slightly
why
ought
it
the
question
was
a
little
bewildering
why
because
you
are
young
and
a
girl
he
replied
it
s
natural
to
be
cheerful
isn
t
it
is
it
she
answered
listlessly
i
can
not
tell
i
have
not
had
much
how
old
are
you
he
asked
bluntly
this
time
it
certainly
seemed
as
though
her
reply
would
contain
some
rebuke
for
his
curiosity
she
glanced
once
more
into
his
face
however
and
the
instinctive
desire
to
administer
that
snub
passed
away
he
was
so
obviously
interested
his
question
was
asked
so
naturally
that
its
spice
of
impertinence
was
as
though
it
had
not
existed
i
am
she
told
him
and
how
long
have
you
lived
here
since
i
left
four
years
anywhere
near
where
i
am
going
to
bury
myself
for
a
time
i
wonder
he
went
on
that
depends
she
replied
our
only
neighbours
are
the
lorneybrookes
of
market
burnham
are
you
going
there
he
shook
his
head
i
ve
got
a
little
shanty
of
my
own
he
explained
quite
close
to
david
s
station
i
ve
never
even
seen
it
she
vouchsafed
some
slight
show
of
curiosity
where
is
this
shanty
as
you
call
it
she
asked
him
i
really
haven
t
the
faintest
idea
he
replied
i
am
looking
for
it
now
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
it
stands
just
out
of
reach
of
the
full
tides
on
a
piece
of
rock
dead
on
the
beach
and
about
a
mile
from
the
station
it
was
built
originally
for
a
coastguard
station
and
meant
to
hold
a
lifeboat
but
they
found
they
could
never
launch
the
lifeboat
when
they
had
it
so
the
man
to
whom
all
the
foreshore
and
most
of
the
land
around
here
belongs
a
fentolin
i
believe
sold
it
to
my
father
i
expect
the
place
has
tumbled
to
pieces
by
this
time
but
i
thought
i
d
have
a
look
at
she
was
gazing
at
him
steadfastly
now
with
parted
lips
what
is
your
name
she
demanded
richard
she
repeated
it
lingeringly
it
seemed
quite
unfamiliar
was
your
father
a
great
friend
of
fentolin
s
then
she
asked
i
believe
so
in
a
sort
of
way
he
answered
my
father
was
hamel
the
artist
you
know
they
made
him
an
some
time
before
he
died
he
used
to
come
out
here
and
live
in
a
tent
then
fentolin
let
him
use
this
place
and
finally
sold
it
to
him
my
father
used
often
to
speak
to
me
about
it
before
he
tell
me
she
enquired
i
do
not
know
much
about
these
matters
but
have
you
any
papers
to
prove
that
it
was
sold
to
your
father
and
that
you
have
the
right
to
occupy
it
now
when
you
choose
he
smiled
of
course
i
have
he
assured
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
none
of
us
have
been
here
for
so
long
i
thought
i
d
better
bring
the
or
whatever
they
call
it
along
with
me
it
s
with
the
rest
of
my
traps
at
norwich
oh
the
place
belongs
to
me
right
enough
he
went
on
smiling
don
t
tell
me
that
any
one
s
pulled
it
down
or
that
it
s
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
no
she
said
it
still
remains
there
when
we
are
round
the
next
curve
i
think
i
can
show
it
to
you
but
every
one
has
forgotten
i
think
that
it
doesn
t
belong
to
fentolin
still
he
uses
it
himself
very
what
for
she
looked
at
her
questioner
quite
steadfastly
quite
quietly
speechlessly
a
curious
uneasiness
crept
into
his
thoughts
there
were
mysterious
things
in
her
face
he
knew
from
that
moment
that
she
too
directly
or
indirectly
was
concerned
with
those
strange
happenings
at
which
kinsley
had
hinted
he
knew
that
there
were
things
which
she
was
keeping
from
him
now
mr
fentolin
uses
one
of
the
rooms
as
a
studio
he
likes
to
paint
there
and
be
near
the
sea
she
explained
but
for
the
rest
i
do
not
know
i
never
go
near
the
i
am
afraid
he
remarked
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
that
i
shall
be
a
little
unpopular
with
fentolin
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
written
first
but
then
of
course
i
had
no
idea
that
any
one
was
making
use
of
the
i
do
not
understand
she
said
how
you
can
possibly
expect
to
come
down
like
this
and
live
there
without
any
why
not
you
haven
t
any
servants
nor
any
furniture
nor
things
to
cook
he
laughed
oh
i
am
an
old
campaigner
he
assured
her
i
meant
to
pick
up
a
few
oddments
in
the
village
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
stay
very
long
anyhow
but
i
thought
i
d
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
what
sort
of
a
man
is
fentolin
again
there
was
that
curious
expression
in
her
eyes
an
expression
almost
of
secret
terror
this
time
not
wholly
concealed
he
could
have
sworn
that
her
hands
were
cold
he
met
with
an
accident
many
years
ago
she
said
slowly
both
his
legs
were
amputated
he
spends
his
life
in
a
little
carriage
which
he
wheels
about
poor
fellow
hamel
exclaimed
with
a
strong
man
s
ready
sympathy
for
suffering
that
is
just
as
much
as
i
have
heard
about
him
is
he
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
in
other
ways
i
suppose
anyhow
if
he
has
really
taken
a
fancy
to
my
little
shanty
i
shall
have
to
give
it
then
as
it
seemed
to
him
for
the
first
time
real
life
leaped
into
her
face
she
leaned
towards
him
her
tone
was
half
commanding
half
imploring
her
manner
entirely
confidential
don
t
she
begged
it
is
yours
claim
it
live
in
it
do
anything
you
like
with
it
but
take
it
away
from
fentolin
hamel
was
speechless
he
sat
a
little
forward
a
hand
on
either
knee
his
mouth
ungracefully
open
an
expression
of
blank
and
utter
bewilderment
in
his
face
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
have
vague
doubts
concerning
this
young
lady
everything
about
her
had
been
so
strange
her
quiet
entrance
into
the
carriage
her
unusual
manner
of
talking
and
finally
this
last
passionate
inexplicable
appeal
i
am
afraid
he
said
at
last
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
say
the
poor
fellow
has
taken
a
fancy
to
the
place
and
likes
being
there
well
it
isn
t
much
of
a
catch
for
me
anyway
i
m
rather
a
wanderer
and
i
dare
say
i
shan
t
be
back
in
these
parts
again
for
years
why
shouldn
t
i
let
him
have
it
if
he
wants
it
it
s
no
loss
to
me
i
m
not
a
painter
you
know
like
my
she
seemed
on
the
point
of
making
a
further
appeal
her
lips
even
were
parted
her
head
a
little
thrown
back
and
then
she
stopped
she
said
nothing
the
silence
lasted
so
long
that
he
became
almost
embarrassed
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
am
a
little
dense
won
t
you
he
begged
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
went
on
smiling
i
ve
got
a
sort
of
feeling
that
i
d
like
to
do
anything
you
ask
me
now
won
t
you
just
explain
a
little
more
clearly
what
you
mean
and
i
ll
blow
up
the
old
place
sky
high
if
it
s
any
pleasure
to
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
reverted
to
her
former
self
the
cold
and
colourless
young
woman
who
had
first
taken
the
seat
opposite
to
his
mine
was
a
very
foolish
request
she
admitted
quietly
i
am
sorry
that
i
ever
made
it
it
was
just
an
impulse
because
the
little
building
we
were
speaking
of
has
been
connected
with
one
or
two
very
disagreeable
episodes
nevertheless
it
was
foolish
of
me
how
long
did
you
think
of
staying
there
that
is
she
added
with
a
faint
smile
providing
that
you
find
it
possible
to
prove
your
claim
and
take
up
possession
oh
just
for
a
week
or
so
he
answered
lightly
and
as
to
regaining
possession
of
it
he
went
on
a
slightly
pugnacious
instinct
stirring
him
i
don
t
imagine
that
there
ll
be
any
difficulty
about
really
she
murmured
not
that
i
want
to
make
myself
disagreeable
he
continued
but
the
tower
is
mine
right
enough
even
if
i
have
let
it
remain
unoccupied
for
some
she
let
down
the
window
a
task
in
which
he
hastened
to
assist
her
a
rush
of
salt
cold
air
swept
into
the
compartment
he
sniffed
it
eagerly
wonderful
he
exclaimed
she
stretched
out
a
long
arm
and
pointed
away
in
the
distance
on
the
summit
of
a
line
of
pebbled
shore
standing
as
it
seemed
sheer
over
the
sea
was
a
little
black
speck
that
she
said
is
the
he
changed
his
position
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
well
it
s
a
queer
little
place
he
remarked
it
doesn
t
look
worth
quarrelling
over
does
it
and
that
she
went
on
directing
his
attention
to
the
hill
is
fentolin
s
home
david
s
for
several
moments
he
made
no
remark
at
all
there
was
something
curiously
impressive
in
that
sudden
sweep
up
from
the
the
strange
miniature
mountain
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
marshes
with
its
background
and
the
long
front
of
the
house
turned
bravely
to
the
sea
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
he
declared
why
it
s
barely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
sea
isn
t
it
a
little
more
than
that
it
is
a
strangely
situated
abode
isn
t
it
wonderful
he
agreed
with
emphasis
i
must
study
the
geological
formation
of
that
hill
he
continued
with
interest
why
it
looks
almost
like
an
island
that
is
because
of
the
floods
she
told
him
even
at
high
tide
the
creeks
never
reach
so
far
as
the
back
there
all
the
water
you
see
stretching
away
inland
is
flood
water
the
result
of
the
storm
i
suppose
this
is
where
you
get
out
she
concluded
rising
to
her
feet
she
turned
away
with
the
slightest
nod
a
maid
was
already
awaiting
her
at
the
door
of
the
compartment
hamel
was
suddenly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
disliked
her
going
immensely
we
shall
perhaps
meet
again
during
the
next
few
days
he
remarked
she
half
turned
her
head
her
expression
was
scarcely
encouraging
i
hope
she
said
that
you
will
not
be
disappointed
in
your
hamel
followed
her
slowly
on
to
the
platform
saw
her
escorted
to
a
very
handsome
by
an
obsequious
and
watched
the
former
disappear
down
the
stretch
of
straight
road
which
led
to
the
hill
then
with
a
stick
in
one
hand
and
the
handbag
which
was
his
sole
luggage
in
the
other
he
left
the
station
and
turned
seaward
chapter
ix
fentolin
surrounded
by
his
satellites
was
seated
in
his
chair
before
the
there
were
present
in
the
room
most
of
the
people
important
to
him
in
his
somewhat
singular
life
a
few
feet
away
in
characteristic
attitude
stood
meekins
doctor
sarson
with
his
hands
behind
him
was
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
stood
a
confidential
telegraph
clerk
who
was
just
departing
with
a
little
sheaf
of
messages
by
his
side
with
a
notebook
in
her
hand
stood
fentolin
s
private
secretary
a
woman
with
a
strangely
transparent
skin
and
light
brown
eyes
dressed
in
somber
black
a
woman
who
might
have
been
of
any
age
from
thirty
to
fifty
behind
her
was
a
man
whose
position
in
the
household
no
one
was
quite
sure
about
a
man
whose
name
was
ryan
and
who
might
very
well
have
been
once
an
actor
or
a
clergyman
in
the
background
stood
henderson
the
perfect
butler
it
is
perhaps
opportune
fentolin
said
quietly
that
you
all
whom
i
trust
should
be
present
here
together
i
wish
you
to
understand
one
thing
you
have
i
believe
in
my
employ
learned
the
gift
of
silence
it
is
to
be
exercised
with
regard
to
a
certain
visitor
brought
here
by
my
nephew
a
visitor
whom
i
regret
to
say
is
now
lying
seriously
there
was
absolute
silence
doctor
sarson
alone
turned
from
the
window
as
though
about
to
speak
but
met
fentolin
s
eye
and
at
once
resumed
his
position
i
rely
upon
you
all
fentolin
continued
softly
henderson
you
perhaps
have
the
most
difficult
task
for
you
have
the
servants
to
control
nevertheless
i
rely
upon
you
also
if
one
word
of
this
visitor
s
presence
here
leaks
out
even
so
far
as
the
village
out
they
go
every
one
of
them
i
will
not
have
a
servant
in
the
place
who
does
not
respect
my
wishes
you
can
give
any
reason
you
like
for
my
orders
it
is
a
whim
i
have
whims
and
i
choose
to
pay
for
them
you
are
all
better
paid
than
any
man
breathing
could
pay
you
in
return
i
ask
only
for
your
implicit
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
a
cigarette
from
a
curiously
carved
ivory
box
which
stood
by
his
side
he
tapped
it
gently
upon
the
table
and
looked
up
i
think
sir
henderson
said
respectfully
that
i
can
answer
for
the
servants
being
mostly
foreigners
they
see
little
or
nothing
of
the
village
no
one
else
made
any
remark
it
was
strange
to
see
how
dominated
they
all
were
by
that
queer
little
fragment
of
humanity
whose
head
scarcely
reached
a
foot
above
the
table
before
which
he
sat
they
departed
silently
almost
abjectly
dismissed
with
a
single
wave
of
the
hand
fentolin
beckoned
his
secretary
to
remain
she
came
a
little
nearer
sit
down
lucy
he
ordered
she
seated
herself
a
few
feet
away
from
him
fentolin
watched
her
for
several
moments
he
himself
had
his
back
to
the
light
the
woman
on
the
other
hand
was
facing
it
the
windows
were
high
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
to
their
fullest
extent
a
cold
stream
of
northern
light
fell
upon
her
face
fentolin
gazed
at
her
and
nodded
his
head
slightly
my
dear
lucy
he
declared
you
are
wonderful
a
perfect
cameo
a
gem
to
look
at
you
now
with
your
delightful
white
hair
and
your
flawless
skin
one
would
never
believe
that
you
had
ever
spoken
a
single
angry
word
that
you
had
ever
felt
the
blood
flow
through
your
veins
or
that
your
eyes
had
ever
looked
upon
the
gentle
things
of
she
looked
at
him
still
without
speech
the
immobility
of
her
face
was
indeed
a
marvellous
thing
fentolin
s
expression
darkened
sometimes
he
murmured
softly
i
think
that
if
i
had
strong
fingers
really
strong
fingers
you
know
lucy
i
should
want
to
take
you
by
the
throat
and
hold
you
tighter
and
tighter
until
your
breath
came
fast
and
your
eyes
came
out
from
their
she
turned
over
a
few
pages
of
her
notebook
to
all
appearance
she
had
not
heard
a
word
she
announced
is
the
fourth
of
april
shall
i
send
out
the
various
checks
to
those
men
in
paris
new
york
frankfort
petersburg
and
tokio
you
can
send
the
checks
he
told
her
be
sure
that
you
draw
them
as
usual
upon
the
credit
lyonaise
and
in
the
name
you
know
of
say
to
lebonaitre
of
paris
that
you
consider
his
last
reports
faulty
no
mention
was
made
of
monsieur
c
s
visit
to
the
russian
embassy
or
of
the
supper
party
given
to
the
baron
von
erlstein
by
a
certain
russian
gentleman
warn
him
if
you
please
that
reports
with
such
omissions
are
useless
to
she
wrote
a
few
words
in
her
book
you
made
a
note
of
that
she
raised
her
head
i
do
not
make
mistakes
she
said
his
eyebrows
were
drawn
together
this
was
his
work
he
told
himself
this
magnificent
physical
subjection
yet
his
inability
to
stir
her
sometimes
maddened
him
you
know
who
is
in
this
house
he
asked
you
know
the
name
of
my
unknown
guest
i
know
nothing
she
replied
his
presence
does
not
interest
supposing
i
desire
you
to
know
he
persisted
leaning
a
little
forward
supposing
i
tell
you
that
it
is
your
duty
to
know
then
she
said
i
should
tell
you
that
i
believe
him
to
be
the
special
envoy
from
new
york
to
the
hague
or
whatever
place
on
the
continent
this
coming
conference
is
to
be
held
right
woman
fentolin
answered
sharply
right
it
is
the
special
envoy
he
has
his
mandate
with
him
i
have
them
both
the
man
and
his
mandate
can
you
guess
what
i
am
going
to
do
with
them
it
is
not
difficult
she
replied
your
methods
are
scarcely
original
his
mandate
to
the
flames
and
his
body
to
the
sea
she
raised
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
and
looked
over
fentolin
s
shoulder
across
the
marshland
to
the
grey
stretch
of
ocean
her
eyes
became
fixed
it
was
not
possible
to
say
that
they
held
any
expression
and
yet
one
felt
that
she
saw
beneath
the
grey
waves
even
to
the
rocks
and
caverns
below
it
does
not
terrify
you
then
he
asked
curiously
to
think
that
a
man
under
this
roof
is
about
to
die
why
should
it
she
retorted
death
does
not
frighten
me
my
own
or
anybody
else
s
does
it
frighten
you
his
face
was
suddenly
livid
his
eyes
full
of
fierce
anger
his
lips
twitched
he
struck
the
table
before
him
beast
of
a
woman
he
shouted
you
ghoul
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
he
stopped
short
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
all
the
time
the
woman
remained
unmoved
do
you
know
he
muttered
his
voice
still
shaking
a
little
that
i
believe
sometimes
i
am
afraid
of
you
how
would
you
like
to
see
me
there
eh
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
hungry
sea
you
watch
sometimes
so
fixedly
you
d
miss
me
wouldn
t
you
i
am
a
good
master
you
know
i
pay
well
you
ve
been
with
me
a
good
many
years
you
were
a
different
sort
of
woman
when
you
first
yes
she
admitted
i
was
a
different
sort
of
you
don
t
remember
those
days
i
suppose
he
went
on
the
days
when
you
had
brown
hair
when
you
used
to
carry
roses
about
and
sing
to
yourself
while
you
beat
your
work
out
of
that
wretched
typewriter
no
she
answered
i
do
not
remember
those
days
they
do
not
belong
to
me
it
is
some
other
woman
you
are
thinking
their
eyes
met
fentolin
turned
away
first
he
struck
the
bell
at
his
elbow
she
rose
at
once
be
off
he
ordered
when
you
look
at
me
like
that
you
send
shivers
through
me
you
ll
have
to
go
i
can
see
you
ll
have
to
go
i
can
t
keep
you
any
longer
you
are
the
only
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
who
dares
to
say
things
to
me
which
make
me
think
the
only
person
who
doesn
t
shrink
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
you
ll
have
to
go
send
sarson
to
me
at
once
you
ve
upset
me
she
listened
to
his
words
in
expressionless
silence
when
he
had
finished
carrying
her
book
in
her
hand
she
very
quietly
moved
towards
the
door
he
watched
her
leaning
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
his
lips
parted
his
eyes
threatening
she
walked
with
steady
even
footsteps
she
carried
herself
with
almost
erectness
her
skirts
were
noiseless
she
had
the
trick
of
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
in
perfect
silence
he
heard
her
calm
voice
in
the
hall
doctor
sarson
is
to
go
to
fentolin
sat
quite
still
feeling
his
own
pulse
that
woman
he
muttered
to
himself
that
woman
some
day
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
she
really
he
paused
the
doctor
had
entered
the
room
i
am
upset
sarson
he
declared
come
and
feel
my
pulse
quickly
that
woman
has
upset
miss
price
miss
price
d
n
it
lucy
yes
it
seems
unlike
her
the
doctor
remarked
i
have
never
heard
her
utter
a
useless
syllable
in
my
fentolin
held
out
his
wrist
it
s
what
she
doesn
t
say
he
muttered
the
doctor
produced
his
watch
in
less
than
a
minute
he
put
it
away
this
is
quite
unnecessary
he
pronounced
your
pulse
is
not
hurried
no
signs
of
palpitation
you
have
seven
or
eight
footmen
all
young
men
doctor
sarson
replied
drily
i
will
wager
that
there
isn
t
one
of
them
has
a
pulse
so
vigorous
as
fentolin
leaned
a
little
back
in
his
chair
an
expression
of
satisfaction
crept
over
his
face
you
reassure
me
my
dear
sarson
that
is
excellent
what
of
our
patient
there
is
no
i
am
afraid
fentolin
sighed
that
we
shall
have
trouble
with
him
these
strong
people
always
give
it
will
be
just
the
same
in
the
long
run
the
doctor
remarked
shrugging
his
shoulders
fentolin
held
up
his
finger
listen
a
i
believe
it
is
miss
fentolin
who
is
just
arriving
the
doctor
announced
i
saw
the
car
coming
as
i
crossed
the
fentolin
nodded
gently
indeed
he
replied
indeed
so
my
dear
niece
has
returned
open
the
door
friend
sarson
open
the
door
if
you
please
she
will
be
anxious
to
see
me
we
must
summon
chapter
x
fentolin
raised
to
his
lips
the
little
gold
whistle
which
hung
from
his
neck
and
blew
it
he
seemed
to
devote
very
little
effort
to
the
operation
yet
the
strength
of
the
note
was
wonderful
as
the
echoes
died
away
he
let
it
fall
by
his
side
and
waited
with
a
pleased
smile
upon
his
lips
in
a
few
seconds
there
was
the
hurried
flutter
of
skirts
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
the
girl
who
had
just
completed
her
railway
journey
entered
followed
by
her
brother
they
were
both
a
little
out
of
breath
they
both
approached
the
chair
without
a
smile
the
girl
in
advance
with
a
certain
expression
of
apprehension
in
her
eyes
fentolin
sighed
he
appeared
to
notice
these
things
and
regret
them
my
child
he
said
holding
out
his
hands
my
dear
esther
welcome
home
again
i
heard
the
car
outside
i
am
grieved
that
you
did
not
at
once
hurry
to
my
i
have
not
been
in
the
house
two
minutes
esther
replied
and
i
haven
t
seen
mother
yet
forgive
she
had
come
to
a
standstill
a
few
yards
away
she
moved
now
very
slowly
towards
the
chair
with
the
air
of
one
fulfilling
a
hateful
task
the
fingers
which
accepted
his
hands
were
extended
almost
hesitatingly
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
and
held
her
there
your
mother
my
dear
esther
is
i
regret
to
say
suffering
from
a
slight
indisposition
he
remarked
she
has
been
confined
to
her
room
for
the
last
few
days
just
a
trifling
affair
of
the
nerves
nothing
more
doctor
sarson
assures
me
but
my
dear
child
he
went
on
your
fingers
are
as
cold
as
ice
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
too
alas
you
have
not
the
affectionate
disposition
of
your
dear
mother
one
would
scarcely
believe
that
we
have
been
parted
for
more
than
a
for
more
than
a
week
she
repeated
under
her
breath
stoop
down
my
dear
i
must
kiss
your
forehead
there
now
bring
up
a
chair
to
my
side
you
seem
frightened
alarmed
have
you
ill
news
for
me
i
have
no
news
she
answered
gradually
recovering
herself
the
gaieties
of
london
i
fear
he
protested
gently
have
proved
a
little
there
were
no
gaieties
for
me
the
girl
replied
bitterly
mrs
sargent
obeyed
your
orders
very
faithfully
i
was
not
allowed
to
move
out
except
with
my
dear
child
you
would
not
go
about
london
unchaperoned
there
is
a
difference
she
retorted
between
a
chaperon
and
a
fentolin
sighed
he
shook
his
head
slowly
he
seemed
pained
i
am
not
sure
that
you
repay
my
care
as
it
deserves
esther
he
declared
there
is
something
in
your
deportment
which
disappoints
me
never
mind
your
brother
has
made
some
atonement
i
entrusted
him
with
a
little
mission
in
which
i
am
glad
to
say
that
he
has
been
brilliantly
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
esther
replied
quietly
fentolin
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
long
fingers
played
nervously
together
he
looked
at
her
gravely
my
dear
child
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
pained
surprise
your
attitude
distresses
me
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
told
you
what
i
think
about
gerald
and
the
life
he
is
compelled
to
live
here
i
don
t
mind
so
much
for
myself
but
for
him
i
think
it
is
the
same
as
ever
fentolin
sighed
i
fear
that
this
little
change
has
done
you
no
good
dear
change
she
echoed
it
was
only
a
change
of
fentolin
shook
his
head
slowly
a
distressful
gesture
yet
all
the
time
he
had
somehow
the
air
of
a
man
secretly
gratified
you
are
beginning
to
depress
me
he
announced
i
think
that
you
can
go
away
no
stop
for
just
one
moment
stand
there
in
the
light
dear
me
how
unfortunate
who
would
have
thought
that
so
beautiful
a
mother
could
have
so
plain
a
daughter
she
stood
quite
still
before
him
her
hands
crossed
in
front
of
her
something
of
the
look
of
the
nun
from
whom
the
power
of
suffering
has
gone
in
her
still
cold
face
and
steadfast
eyes
not
a
touch
of
colour
he
continued
meditatively
a
figure
straight
as
my
what
a
pity
and
all
the
taste
nowadays
they
tell
me
is
in
the
other
direction
the
lank
damsels
have
gone
completely
out
we
buried
them
with
oscar
wilde
run
along
my
dear
child
you
do
not
amuse
me
you
can
take
gerald
with
you
if
you
will
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
gerald
just
now
he
is
in
my
good
books
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
gerald
your
allowance
for
instance
a
trifling
increase
or
an
advance
i
am
in
a
generous
then
grant
me
what
i
begged
for
the
other
day
the
boy
answered
quickly
let
me
go
to
sandhurst
i
could
enter
my
name
next
week
for
the
examinations
and
i
could
pass
fentolin
tapped
the
table
thoughtfully
with
his
forefinger
a
little
ungrateful
my
dear
boy
he
declared
a
little
ungrateful
that
i
think
your
confidence
in
yourself
pleases
me
though
you
think
you
could
pass
your
examinations
i
did
a
set
of
papers
last
week
the
boy
replied
on
the
given
percentages
i
came
out
twelfth
or
better
brown
assured
me
that
i
could
go
in
for
them
at
any
moment
he
promised
to
write
you
about
it
before
he
fentolin
nodded
gently
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
did
have
a
letter
from
brown
he
remarked
rather
an
impertinence
for
a
tutor
i
thought
it
he
devoted
three
pages
towards
impressing
upon
me
the
necessity
of
your
adopting
some
sort
of
a
he
wrote
because
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
the
boy
said
doggedly
so
you
want
to
be
a
soldier
fentolin
continued
musingly
well
well
why
not
our
picture
galleries
are
full
of
them
there
has
been
a
fentolin
in
every
great
battle
for
the
last
five
hundred
years
sailors
too
plenty
of
them
and
just
a
few
diplomatists
brave
fellows
not
one
i
fancy
he
added
like
me
not
one
condemned
to
pass
their
days
in
a
perambulator
you
are
a
fine
fellow
gerald
a
regular
fentolin
getting
on
for
six
feet
aren
t
you
six
feet
two
a
very
fine
fellow
fentolin
repeated
i
am
not
so
sure
about
the
army
gerald
you
see
there
are
some
people
who
say
like
your
american
friend
that
we
are
even
now
almost
on
the
brink
of
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
hurry
the
boy
begged
fentolin
closed
his
eyes
don
t
he
insisted
have
you
ever
stopped
to
think
what
war
means
the
war
you
speak
of
so
lightly
the
suffering
the
misery
of
it
all
the
pageantry
and
music
and
heroism
in
front
and
behind
a
blackened
world
a
trail
of
writhing
corpses
a
world
of
weeping
women
for
whom
the
sun
shall
never
rise
again
ugh
an
ugly
thing
war
gerald
i
am
not
sure
that
you
are
not
better
at
home
here
why
not
practise
golf
a
little
more
assiduously
i
see
from
the
local
paper
that
you
are
still
playing
at
two
handicap
now
with
your
physique
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
been
a
scratch
player
long
before
i
play
cricket
sir
the
boy
reminded
him
a
little
impatiently
and
after
all
there
are
other
things
in
the
world
besides
fentolin
s
long
finger
shot
suddenly
out
he
was
leaning
a
little
from
his
chair
his
expression
of
gentle
immobility
had
passed
away
his
face
was
stern
almost
stony
you
have
spoken
the
truth
gerald
he
said
there
are
other
things
in
the
world
besides
games
there
is
the
real
the
tragical
side
of
life
the
duties
one
takes
up
the
obligations
of
honour
you
have
not
forgotten
young
man
the
burden
you
carry
the
boy
was
paler
but
he
had
drawn
himself
to
his
full
height
i
have
not
forgotten
sir
he
answered
bitterly
do
i
show
any
signs
of
forgetting
haven
t
i
done
your
bidding
year
by
year
aren
t
i
here
now
to
do
it
then
do
it
fentolin
retorted
sharply
when
i
am
ready
for
you
to
leave
here
you
shall
leave
until
then
you
are
mine
remember
that
ah
this
is
doctor
sarson

believe
that
must
mean
that
it
is
five
o
clock

have
been
having
a
little
pleasant
doctor
sarson
bowed
to
esther
who
scarcely
glanced
at
him
he
remained
in
the
background
quietly
waiting
a
very
delightful
little
conversation
fentolin
concluded
i
have
been
congratulating
my
nephew
doctor
upon
his
wisdom
in
preferring
the
quiet
country
life
down
here
to
the
wearisome
routine
of
a
profession
he
escapes
the
embarrassing
choice
of
a
career
by
preferring
to
devote
his
life
to
my
comfort
i
shall
not
forget
it
i
shall
not
be
ungrateful
i
may
have
my
faults
but
i
am
not
ungrateful

away
now

you

towards

door
the

and

passed
out

led
gerald
into
the
great
and
from
there
through
the
open
windows
out
on
to
the
terrace
she
gripped
his
shoulder
and
pointed
down
to
the
tower
something
she
whispered
in
his
ear
is
going
to
happen
chapter
xi
the
little
station
at
which
hamel
alighted
was
like
an
oasis
in
the
middle
of
a
flat
stretch
of
sand
and
marsh
it
consisted
only
of
a
few
raised
planks
and
a
rude
shelter
built
indeed
for
the
convenience
of
david
s
hall
alone
for
the
nearest
village
was
two
miles
away
the
on
his
return
from
escorting
the
young
lady
to
her
car
stared
at
this
other
passenger
in
some
surprise
which
way
to
the
sea
hamel
asked
the
man
pointed
to
the
white
gates
of
the
crossing
you
can
take
any
of
those
paths
you
like
sir
he
said
if
you
want
to
get
to
salthouse
though
you
should
have
got
out
at
the
next
this
will
do
for
me
hamel
replied
cheerfully
be
careful
of
the
dikes
the
advised
him
some
of
them
are
pretty
hamel
nodded
and
passing
through
the
white
gates
made
his
way
by
a
raised
cattle
track
towards
the
sea
on
either
side
of
him
flowed
a
narrow
dike
filled
with
beyond
stretched
the
flat
marshland
its
mossy
turf
leavened
with
cracks
and
creeks
of
all
widths
filled
also
with
and
a
slight
grey
mist
rested
upon
the
more
distant
parts
of
the
wilderness
which
he
was
crossing
a
mist
which
seemed
to
be
blown
in
from
the
sea
in
little
puffs
resting
for
a
time
upon
the
earth
and
then
drifting
up
and
fading
away
like
soap
bubbles
more
than
once
where
the
dikes
had
overflown
he
was
compelled
to
change
his
course
but
he
arrived
at
last
at
the
little
ridge
of
pebbled
beach
bordering
the
sea
straight
ahead
of
him
now
was
that
building
towards
which
he
had
all
the
time
been
directing
his
footsteps
as
he
approached
it
his
forehead
slightly
contracted
there
was
ample
confirmation
before
him
of
the
truth
of
his
s
words
the
place
left
to
itself
for
so
many
years
without
any
attention
from
its
actual
owner
was
neither
deserted
nor
in
ruins
its
solid
grey
stone
walls
were
and
a
trifle
worn
but
the
arched
wooden
doors
leading
into
the
lifeboat
shelter
which
occupied
one
side
of
the
building
had
been
newly
painted
and
in
the
front
the
window
was
hung
with
a
curtain
now
closely
drawn
of
some
dark
red
material
the
lock
from
the
door
had
been
removed
altogether
and
in
its
place
was
the
aperture
for
a
yale
the
last
note
of
modernity
was
supplied
by
the
telephone
wire
attached
to
the
roof
of
the
lifeboat
shelter
he
walked
all
round
the
building
seeking
in
vain
for
some
other
means
of
ingress
then
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
front
of
the
curtained
window
he
was
a
man
of
somewhat
determined
disposition
and
he
found
himself
vaguely
irritated
by
the
liberties
which
had
been
taken
with
his
property
he
hammered
gently
upon
the
framework
with
his
fist
and
the
windows
opened
readily
inwards
pushing
back
the
curtain
with
them
he
drew
himself
up
on
to
the
sill
and
squeezing
himself
through
the
opening
landed
on
his
feet
and
looked
around
him
a
little
breathless
he
found
himself
in
a
simply
furnished
man
s
an
easel
was
standing
close
to
the
window
there
were
reams
of
drawing
paper
and
several
unfinished
sketches
leaning
against
the
wall
there
was
a
small
oak
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
against
the
wall
stood
an
exquisite
chiffonier
on
which
were
resting
some
decanters
and
goblets
there
was
a
turkey
carpet
upon
the
floor
which
matched
the
curtains
but
to
his
surprise
there
was
not
a
single
chair
of
any
sort
to
be
seen
the
walls
had
been
distempered
and
were
hung
with
one
or
two
engravings
which
although
he
was
no
judge
he
was
quite
sure
were
good
he
wandered
into
the
back
room
where
he
found
a
stove
a
upon
a
deal
table
and
several
other
cooking
utensils
all
spotlessly
clean
and
of
the
most
expensive
description
the
walls
here
were
plainly
whitewashed
and
the
floor
was
of
hard
stone
he
then
tried
the
door
on
the
left
which
led
into
the
larger
portion
of
the
building
the
shed
in
which
the
lifeboat
had
once
been
kept
not
only
was
the
door
locked
but
he
saw
at
once
that
the
lock
was
modern
and
the
door
itself
was
secured
with
heavy
iron
clamps
he
returned
to
the
the
girl
with
the
grey
eyes
was
right
enough
he
remarked
to
himself
mr
fentolin
has
been
making
himself
very
much
at
home
with
my
he
withdrew
the
curtains
noticing
to
his
surprise
the
heavy
shutters
which
their
folds
had
partly
concealed
then
he
made
his
way
out
along
the
passage
to
the
front
door
which
from
the
inside
he
was
able
to
open
easily
enough
leaving
it
carefully
ajar
he
went
out
with
the
intention
of
making
an
examination
of
the
outside
of
the
place
instead
however
he
paused
at
the
corner
of
the
building
with
his
face
turned
landwards
exactly
fronting
him
now
about
of
a
mile
away
on
the
summit
of
that
strange
hill
which
stood
out
like
a
gigantic
rock
in
the
wilderness
was
david
s
hall
he
looked
at
it
steadily
and
with
increasing
admiration
its
long
red
brick
front
with
its
masses
of
clustering
chimneys
a
little
bare
and
impressed
him
with
a
sense
of
dignity
due
as
much
to
the
purity
of
its
architecture
as
the
singularity
of
its
situation
behind
a
wonderfully
effective
background
were
the
steep
gardens
from
which
even
in
this
uncertain
light
he
caught
faint
glimpses
of
colouring
subdued
from
brilliancy
by
the
twilight
these
were
encircled
by
a
brick
wall
of
great
height
the
whole
of
the
southern
portion
of
which
was
enclosed
with
glass
from
the
fragment
of
rock
upon
which
he
had
seated
himself
to
the
raised
stone
terrace
in
front
of
the
house
was
an
absolutely
straight
path
beautifully
kept
like
an
avenue
with
white
posts
on
either
side
and
built
up
to
a
considerable
height
above
the
broad
tidal
way
which
ran
for
some
distance
by
its
side
it
had
almost
the
appearance
of
a
racing
track
and
its
state
of
preservation
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
was
little
short
of
remarkable
this
hamel
said
to
himself
as
he
slowly
produced
a
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
fill
it
with
tobacco
from
a
battered
silver
box
is
a
queer
fix
looks
rather
like
the
inn
for
me
and
who
might
you
be
gentleman
he
turned
abruptly
around
towards
his
unseen
questioner
a
woman
was
standing
by
the
side
of
the
rock
upon
which
he
was
sitting
a
woman
from
the
village
apparently
who
must
have
come
with
noiseless
footsteps
along
the
sandy
way
she
was
dressed
in
rusty
black
and
in
place
of
a
hat
she
wore
a
black
woolen
scarf
tied
around
her
head
and
underneath
her
chin
her
face
was
lined
her
hair
of
a
deep
brown
plentifully
besprinkled
with
grey
she
had
a
curious
habit
of
moving
her
lips
even
when
she
was
not
speaking
she
stood
there
smiling
at
him
but
there
was
something
about
that
smile
and
about
her
look
which
puzzled
him
i
am
just
a
visitor
he
replied
who
are
you
she
shook
her
head
i
saw
you
come
out
of
the
tower
she
said
speaking
with
a
strong
local
accent
and
yet
with
a
certain
unusual
correctness
in
at
the
window
and
out
of
the
door
you
re
a
brave
why
brave
he
asked
she
turned
her
head
very
slowly
towards
david
s
hall
a
gleam
of
sunshine
had
caught
one
of
the
windows
which
shone
like
fire
she
pointed
toward
it
with
her
head
he
s
looking
at
you
she
muttered
he
don
t
like
strangers
poking
around
here
that
i
can
tell
and
who
is
he
hamel
enquired
squire
fentolin
she
answered
dropping
her
voice
a
little
he
s
a
very
gentleman
squire
fentolin
but
he
don
t
like
strangers
hanging
well
i
am
not
exactly
a
stranger
you
see
hamel
remarked
my
father
used
to
stay
for
months
at
a
time
in
that
little
shanty
there
and
paint
pictures
it
s
a
good
many
years
i
mind
him
the
woman
said
slowly
his
name
was
i
am
his
son
hamel
announced
she
pointed
to
the
hall
does
he
know
that
you
are
here
hamel
shook
his
head
not
yet
i
have
been
abroad
for
so
she
suddenly
relapsed
into
her
curious
habit
her
lips
moved
but
no
words
came
she
had
turned
her
head
a
little
and
was
facing
the
sea
tell
me
hamel
asked
gently
why
do
you
come
out
here
alone
so
far
from
the
village
she
pointed
with
her
finger
to
where
the
waves
were
breaking
in
a
thin
line
of
white
about
fifty
yards
from
the
beach
it
s
the
cemetery
that
she
said
the
village
cemetery
you
know
i
have
three
buried
there
george
the
eldest
james
the
middle
one
and
david
the
youngest
three
of
them
that
s
why
i
come
i
can
t
put
flowers
on
their
graves
but
i
can
sit
and
watch
and
look
through
the
sea
down
among
the
rocks
where
their
bodies
are
and
hamel
looked
at
her
curiously
her
voice
had
grown
lower
and
lower
it
s
what
you
land
folks
don
t
believe
perhaps
she
went
on
but
it
s
true
it
s
only
us
who
live
near
the
sea
who
understand
it
i
am
not
an
ignorant
body
either
i
was
schoolmistress
here
before
i
married
david
cox
they
thought
i
d
done
wrong
to
marry
a
fisherman
but
i
bore
him
brave
sons
and
i
lived
the
life
a
woman
craves
for
no
i
am
not
ignorant
i
have
fancies
perhaps
the
lord
be
praised
for
them
and
i
tell
you
it
s
true
you
look
at
a
spot
in
the
sea
and
you
see
nothing
a
gleam
of
blue
a
fleck
of
white
foam
one
day
a
gleam
of
green
with
a
black
line
another
and
a
grey
little
sob
the
next
perhaps
but
you
go
on
looking
you
look
day
by
day
and
hour
by
hour
and
the
chasms
of
the
sea
will
open
and
their
voices
will
come
to
you
listen
she
clutched
his
arm
couldn
t
you
hear
that
she
half
whispered
the
light
it
was
david
s
voice
the
light
hamel
was
speechless
the
woman
s
face
was
suddenly
strangely
transformed
her
mood
however
swiftly
changed
she
turned
once
more
towards
the
hall
you
ll
know
him
soon
she
went
on
the
kindest
man
in
these
parts
they
say
it
s
not
much
that
he
gives
away
but
he
s
a
kind
heart
you
see
that
great
post
at
the
entrance
to
the
river
there
she
went
on
pointing
to
it
he
had
that
set
up
and
a
lamp
hung
from
there
fentolin
s
light
they
call
it
it
was
to
save
men
s
lives
it
was
burning
they
say
the
night
i
lost
my
lads
fentolin
s
light
they
were
wrecked
he
asked
her
gently
wrecked
she
answered
bad
steering
it
must
have
been
james
would
steer
and
they
say
that
he
drank
a
bit
bad
steering
yes
you
ll
meet
squire
fentolin
before
long
he
s
queer
to
look
at
a
small
body
but
a
great
kind
heart
a
miserable
life
his
but
it
will
be
made
up
to
him
it
will
be
made
up
to
him
she
turned
away
her
lips
were
moving
all
the
time
she
walked
about
a
dozen
steps
and
then
she
returned
you
re
hamel
s
son
the
painter
she
said
you
ll
be
welcome
down
here
he
ll
have
you
to
stay
at
the
hall
a
brave
place
don
t
let
him
be
too
kind
to
you
sometimes
kindness
she
passed
on
walking
with
a
curious
shambling
gait
and
soon
she
disappeared
on
her
way
to
the
village
hamel
watched
her
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
his
head
towards
david
s
hall
he
felt
somehow
that
her
abrupt
departure
was
due
to
something
which
she
had
seen
in
that
direction
he
rose
to
his
feet
his
instinct
had
been
a
true
one
chapter
xii
from
where
hamel
stood
a
queer
object
came
strangely
into
sight
below
the
terrace
of
david
s
hall
from
a
spot
in
fact
at
the
base
of
the
solid
wall
it
seemed
as
though
a
gate
had
been
opened
and
there
came
towards
him
what
he
at
first
took
to
be
a
tricycle
as
it
came
nearer
it
presented
even
a
weirder
appearance
fentolin
in
a
black
cape
and
black
skull
cap
sat
a
little
forward
in
his
electric
carriage
with
his
hand
upon
the
guiding
lever
his
head
came
scarcely
above
the
back
of
the
little
vehicle
his
hands
and
body
were
motionless
he
seemed
to
be
progressing
without
the
slightest
effort
personal
or
mechanical
as
though
he
rode
in
deed
in
some
ghostly
vehicle
from
the
same
place
in
the
wall
had
issued
a
moment
or
two
later
a
man
upon
a
bicycle
who
was
also
coming
towards
him
hamel
was
scarcely
conscious
of
this
secondary
figure
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
strange
personage
now
rapidly
approaching
him
there
was
something
which
seemed
scarcely
human
in
that
shrunken
fragment
of
body
the
pale
face
with
its
waving
white
hair
the
strange
expression
with
which
he
was
being
regarded
the
little
vehicle
came
to
a
standstill
only
a
few
feet
away
fentolin
leaned
forward
his
features
had
lost
their
delicately
benevolent
aspect
his
words
were
minatory
i
am
under
the
impression
sir
he
said
that
i
saw
you
with
my
glasses
from
the
window
attempting
to
force
an
entrance
into
that
hamel
nodded
i
not
only
tried
but
i
succeeded
he
remarked
i
got
in
through
the
fentolin
s
eyes
glittered
for
a
moment
hamel
who
had
resumed
his
place
upon
the
rock
close
at
hand
had
been
mixed
up
during
his
lifetime
in
many
wild
escapades
yet
at
that
moment
he
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
there
were
dangers
in
life
which
as
yet
he
had
not
faced
may
i
ask
for
your
explanation
or
your
excuse
you
can
call
it
an
explanation
or
an
excuse
whichever
you
like
hamel
replied
steadily
but
the
fact
is
that
this
little
building
which
some
one
else
seems
to
have
appropriated
is
mine
if
i
had
not
been
a
person
i
should
be
engaged
at
the
present
moment
in
turning
out
its
furniture
on
to
the
what
is
your
name
fentolin
asked
suddenly
my
name
is
hamel
richard
for
several
moments
there
was
silence
fentolin
was
still
leaning
forward
in
his
strange
little
vehicle
the
colour
seemed
to
have
left
even
his
lips
the
hard
glitter
in
his
eyes
had
given
place
to
an
expression
almost
like
fear
he
looked
at
richard
hamel
as
though
he
were
some
strange
come
up
from
underneath
the
sands
richard
hamel
he
repeated
do
you
mean
that
you
are
the
son
of
hamel
the
who
used
to
be
in
these
parts
so
often
he
was
my
brother
s
i
am
his
but
his
son
was
killed
in
the
san
francisco
earthquake
i
saw
his
name
in
all
the
lists
it
was
copied
into
the
local
papers
hamel
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
i
take
a
lot
of
killing
he
observed
i
was
in
that
earthquake
right
enough
and
in
the
hospital
afterwards
but
it
was
a
man
named
hamel
of
philadelphia
who
fentolin
sat
quite
motionless
for
several
moments
he
seemed
if
possible
to
have
shrunken
into
something
smaller
still
a
few
yards
behind
meekins
had
alighted
from
his
bicycle
and
was
standing
waiting
so
you
are
richard
hamel
fentolin
said
at
last
very
softly
welcome
back
to
england
richard
hamel
i
knew
your
father
slightly
although
we
were
never
very
he
stretched
out
his
hand
from
underneath
the
coverlet
of
his
little
vehicle
a
hand
with
long
white
fingers
slim
and
white
and
shapely
as
a
woman
s
a
single
ring
with
a
dull
green
stone
was
on
his
fourth
finger
hamel
shook
hands
with
him
as
he
would
have
shaken
hands
with
a
woman
afterwards
he
rubbed
his
fingers
slowly
together
there
was
something
about
the
touch
which
worried
him
you
have
been
making
use
of
this
little
shanty
haven
t
you
he
asked
bluntly
fentolin
nodded
he
was
apparently
beginning
to
recover
himself
you
must
remember
he
explained
suavely
that
it
was
built
by
my
grandfather
and
that
we
have
had
rights
over
the
whole
of
the
foreshore
here
from
time
immemorial
i
know
quite
well
that
my
brother
gave
it
to
your
father
or
rather
he
sold
it
to
him
for
a
nominal
sum
i
must
tell
you
that
it
was
a
most
complicated
transaction
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
getting
any
lawyer
to
draft
the
deed
of
sale
there
were
so
many
ancient
rights
and
privileges
which
it
was
impossible
to
deal
with
even
now
there
are
grave
doubts
as
to
the
validity
of
the
transaction
when
nothing
was
heard
of
you
and
we
all
concluded
that
you
were
dead
i
ventured
to
take
back
what
i
honestly
believed
to
be
my
own
owing
he
continued
slowly
to
my
unfortunate
affliction
i
am
obliged
to
depend
for
interest
in
my
life
upon
various
hobbies
this
little
place
queerly
enough
has
become
one
of
them
i
have
furnished
it
in
a
way
installed
the
telephone
to
the
house
connected
it
with
my
electric
plant
and
i
come
down
here
when
i
want
to
be
quite
alone
and
paint
i
watch
the
sea
such
a
sea
sometimes
such
storms
such
colour
you
notice
that
ridge
of
sand
out
yonder
it
forms
a
sort
of
natural
breakwater
even
on
the
calmest
day
you
can
trace
that
white
line
of
it
is
a
strange
coast
hamel
admitted
fentolin
pointed
with
his
forefinger
northwards
somewhere
about
there
he
indicated
is
the
entrance
to
the
tidal
river
which
flows
up
to
the
village
of
david
s
yonder
you
see
his
finger
traced
its
course
until
it
came
to
a
certain
point
near
the
beach
where
a
tall
black
pillar
stood
surmounted
by
a
globe
i
have
had
a
light
fixed
there
for
the
benefit
of
the
fishermen
he
said
a
light
which
i
work
from
my
own
dynamo
between
where
we
are
sitting
now
and
there
only
a
little
way
out
to
sea
is
a
jagged
cluster
of
cruel
rocks
you
can
see
them
if
you
care
to
swim
out
in
calm
weather
fishermen
who
tried
to
come
in
by
night
were
often
trapped
there
and
in
a
rough
sea
drowned
that
is
why
i
had
that
pillar
of
light
built
on
stormy
nights
it
shows
the
exact
entrance
to
the
water
very
kind
of
you
indeed
hamel
remarked
very
fentolin
sighed
so
few
people
have
any
real
feeling
for
sailors
he
continued
the
fishermen
around
here
are
certainly
rather
a
casual
class
do
you
know
that
there
is
scarcely
one
of
them
who
can
swim
there
isn
t
one
of
them
who
isn
t
too
lazy
to
learn
even
the
simplest
stroke
my
brother
used
to
say
dear
gerald
that
it
served
them
right
if
they
were
drowned
i
have
never
been
able
to
feel
like
that
hamel
life
is
such
a
wonderful
thing
one
night
he
went
on
dropping
his
voice
and
leaning
a
little
forward
in
his
carriage
it
was
just
before
or
was
it
just
after
i
had
fixed
that
light
i
was
down
here
one
dark
winter
night
there
was
a
great
north
wind
and
a
huge
sea
running
it
was
as
black
as
pitch
but
i
heard
a
boat
making
for
david
s
causeway
strike
on
those
rocks
just
hidden
in
front
there
i
heard
those
fishermen
shriek
as
they
went
under
i
heard
their
shouts
for
help
i
heard
their
death
cries
very
terrible
hamel
very
terrible
hamel
looked
at
the
speaker
curiously
fentolin
seemed
absorbed
in
his
subject
he
had
spoken
with
relish
as
one
who
loves
the
things
he
speaks
about
quite
unaccountably
hamel
found
himself
shivering
it
was
their
mother
fentolin
continued
leaning
again
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
their
mother
whom
i
saw
pass
along
the
beach
just
now
a
widow
too
poor
thing
she
comes
here
often
a
morbid
taste
she
spoke
to
you
i
think
she
spoke
to
me
strangely
hamel
admitted
she
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
woman
whose
brain
had
been
turned
with
too
true
fentolin
sighed
the
poor
creature
i
offered
her
a
small
pension
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
a
superior
woman
in
her
way
once
filled
now
with
queer
fancies
he
went
on
eyeing
hamel
steadily
the
very
strangest
fancies
she
spends
her
life
prowling
about
here
no
one
in
the
village
even
knows
how
she
lives
did
she
speak
of
me
she
spoke
of
you
as
being
a
very
fentolin
sighed
the
poor
creature
well
well
let
us
revert
to
the
object
of
your
coming
here
do
you
really
wish
to
occupy
this
little
shanty
hamel
that
was
my
idea
hamel
confessed
i
only
came
back
from
mexico
last
month
and
i
very
soon
got
fed
up
with
life
in
town
i
am
going
abroad
again
next
year
till
then
i
am
rather
at
a
loose
end
my
father
was
always
very
keen
indeed
about
this
place
and
very
anxious
that
i
should
come
and
stay
here
for
a
little
time
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
run
down
i
ve
got
some
things
waiting
at
norwich
i
thought
i
might
hire
a
woman
to
look
after
me
and
spend
a
few
weeks
here
they
tell
me
that
the
early
spring
is
almost
the
best
time
for
this
fentolin
nodded
slowly
he
moistened
his
lips
for
a
moment
one
might
have
imagined
that
he
was
anxious
mr
hamel
he
said
softly
you
are
quite
right
it
is
the
best
time
to
visit
this
coast
but
why
make
a
hermit
of
yourself
you
are
a
family
friend
come
and
stay
with
us
at
the
hall
for
as
long
as
you
like
it
will
give
me
the
utmost
pleasure
to
welcome
you
there
he
went
on
earnestly
and
as
for
this
little
place
of
what
use
is
it
to
you
let
me
buy
it
from
you
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
i
can
see
you
may
be
rich
yet
money
has
a
definite
value
to
me
it
has
none
that
little
place
as
it
stands
is
probably
worth
say
a
hundred
pounds
your
father
gave
if
i
remember
rightly
a
five
pound
note
for
it
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
for
it
sooner
than
be
hamel
frowned
slightly
i
could
not
possibly
think
he
said
of
selling
what
was
practically
a
gift
to
my
father
you
are
welcome
to
occupy
the
place
during
my
absence
in
any
way
you
wish
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
that
i
care
to
part
with
it
altogether
and
i
should
really
like
to
spend
just
a
day
or
so
here
i
am
used
to
roughing
it
under
all
sorts
of
conditions
much
more
used
to
roughing
it
than
i
am
to
staying
at
country
fentolin
leaned
a
little
out
of
his
carriage
he
reached
the
younger
man
s
shoulder
with
his
hand
ah
hamel
he
pleaded
don
t
make
up
your
mind
too
suddenly
am
i
a
little
spoilt
i
wonder
well
you
see
what
sort
of
a
creature
i
am
i
have
to
go
through
life
as
best
i
may
and
people
are
kind
to
me
it
is
very
seldom
i
am
crossed
it
is
quite
astonishing
how
often
people
let
me
have
my
own
way
do
not
make
up
your
mind
too
suddenly
i
have
a
niece
and
a
nephew
whom
you
must
meet
there
are
some
treasures
too
at
david
s
hall
look
at
it
there
isn
t
another
house
quite
like
it
in
england
it
is
worth
looking
it
is
most
impressive
hamel
agreed
and
wonderfully
beautiful
it
seems
odd
he
added
with
a
laugh
that
you
should
care
about
this
little
shanty
here
with
all
the
beautiful
rooms
you
must
have
of
your
it
s
naboth
s
vineyard
fentolin
groaned
now
hamel
you
are
going
to
be
gracious
aren
t
you
let
us
leave
the
question
of
your
little
habitation
here
alone
for
the
present
come
back
with
me
my
niece
shall
give
you
some
tea
and
you
shall
choose
your
room
from
forty
you
can
sleep
in
a
haunted
chamber
or
a
historical
chamber
in
queen
elizabeth
s
room
a
victorian
chamber
or
a
louis
quinze
room
all
my
people
have
spent
their
substance
in
furniture
don
t
look
at
your
bag
clothes
are
unnecessary
i
can
supply
you
with
everything
or
if
you
prefer
it
i
can
send
a
fast
car
into
norwich
for
your
own
things
come
and
be
my
guest
hamel
hesitated
he
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
go
to
david
s
hall
and
though
he
strove
to
ignore
it
he
was
conscious
of
an
aversion
of
which
he
was
heartily
ashamed
for
this
strange
fragment
of
humanity
on
the
other
hand
his
mission
the
actual
mission
which
had
brought
him
down
to
these
parts
could
certainly
best
be
served
by
an
entree
into
the
hall
itself
and
there
was
the
girl
whom
he
felt
sure
belonged
there
he
had
never
for
a
moment
been
able
to
dismiss
her
from
his
thoughts
her
still
cold
face
the
delicate
perfection
of
her
clothes
and
figure
the
grey
eyes
which
had
rested
upon
his
so
curiously
haunted
him
he
was
desperately
anxious
to
see
her
again
if
he
refused
this
invitation
if
he
rejected
fentolin
s
proffered
friendship
it
would
be
all
the
more
difficult
you
are
really
very
kind
he
began
hesitatingly
it
is
settled
fentolin
interrupted
settled
meekins
you
can
ride
back
again
i
shall
not
paint
hamel
you
will
walk
by
my
side
will
you
not
i
can
run
my
little
machine
quite
slowly
you
see
i
have
an
electric
battery
it
needs
charging
often
but
i
have
a
dynamo
of
my
own
you
never
saw
a
vehicle
like
this
in
all
your
travellings
did
you
hamel
shook
his
head
an
electrical
fentolin
continued
practice
has
made
me
remarkably
skilful
in
its
manipulation
you
see
i
can
steer
to
an
he
was
already
turning
around
hamel
rose
to
his
feet
you
are
really
very
kind
he
said
i
should
like
to
come
up
and
see
the
hall
at
any
rate
but
in
the
meantime
as
we
are
here
could
i
just
look
over
the
inside
of
this
little
place
i
found
the
large
shed
where
the
lifeboat
used
to
be
kept
locked
fentolin
was
manoeuvring
his
carriage
his
back
was
towards
hamel
by
all
means
he
declared
we
will
go
in
together
i
have
had
the
entrance
widened
so
that
i
can
ride
straight
into
the
but
he
paused
suddenly
he
felt
in
all
his
pockets
dear
me
he
exclaimed
i
find
that
i
have
left
the
keys
we
will
come
down
a
little
later
if
you
do
not
mind
hamel
or
perhaps
you
will
not
mind
it
is
very
careless
of
me
but
seeing
you
about
the
place
and
imagining
that
you
were
an
intruder
made
me
angry
and
i
started
off
in
a
hurry
now
walk
by
my
side
up
to
the
house
please
and
talk
to
me
it
is
so
interesting
for
me
to
meet
men
he
went
on
as
they
started
along
the
straight
path
who
do
things
in
life
who
go
to
foreign
countries
meet
strange
people
and
have
new
experiences
i
have
been
a
good
many
years
like
this
you
it
is
a
great
affliction
hamel
murmured
sympathetically
in
my
youth
i
was
an
athlete
fentolin
continued
i
played
cricket
for
the
varsity
and
for
my
county
i
hunted
too
and
shot
i
did
all
the
things
a
man
loves
to
do
i
might
still
shoot
they
tell
me
but
my
strength
has
ebbed
away
i
am
too
weak
to
lift
a
gun
too
weak
even
to
handle
a
i
have
just
a
few
hobbies
in
life
which
keep
me
alive
are
you
a
politician
hamel
not
in
the
least
hamel
replied
i
have
been
out
of
england
too
long
to
keep
in
touch
with
naturally
fentolin
agreed
it
amuses
me
to
follow
the
course
of
events
i
have
a
good
many
friends
in
london
and
abroad
who
are
kind
to
me
who
keep
me
informed
send
me
odd
bits
of
information
not
available
for
every
one
and
it
amuses
me
to
put
these
things
together
in
my
mind
and
to
try
and
play
the
prophet
i
was
in
the
foreign
office
once
you
know
i
take
up
my
paper
every
morning
and
it
is
one
of
my
chief
interests
to
see
how
near
my
own
speculations
come
to
the
truth
just
now
for
example
there
are
strange
things
doing
on
the
in
america
hamel
remarked
they
affect
to
look
upon
england
as
a
doomed
not
altogether
supine
yet
fentolin
observed
yet
even
this
last
generation
has
seen
weakening
we
have
lost
so
much
perhaps
it
is
having
these
children
who
we
think
can
take
care
of
us
canada
and
australia
and
the
others
however
we
will
not
talk
of
politics
it
bores
you
i
can
see
we
will
try
and
find
some
other
subject
now
tell
me
don
t
you
think
this
is
ingenious
they
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
the
hall
was
situated
in
front
of
them
underneath
the
terrace
was
a
little
iron
gate
held
open
now
by
meekins
who
had
gone
on
ahead
and
dismounted
from
his
bicycle
i
have
a
subterranean
way
from
here
into
the
hall
fentolin
explained
come
with
me
you
will
only
have
to
stoop
a
little
and
it
may
amuse
you
you
need
not
be
afraid
there
are
electric
lights
every
ten
yards
i
turn
them
on
with
this
switch
fentolin
touched
a
button
in
the
wall
and
the
place
was
at
once
brilliantly
illuminated
a
little
row
of
lights
from
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
stretched
away
as
far
as
one
could
see
they
passed
through
the
iron
gates
which
shut
behind
them
with
a
click
stooping
a
little
hamel
was
still
able
to
walk
by
the
side
of
the
man
in
the
chair
they
traversed
about
a
hundred
yards
of
subterranean
way
here
and
there
a
fungus
hung
down
from
the
wall
otherwise
it
was
beautifully
kept
and
dry
by
and
by
with
a
little
turn
they
came
to
an
incline
and
another
iron
gate
held
open
for
them
by
a
footman
fentolin
sped
up
the
last
few
feet
into
the
great
hall
which
seemed
more
imposing
than
ever
by
reason
of
this
unexpected
entrance
hamel
blinking
a
little
stepped
to
his
side
welcome
fentolin
cried
gaily
welcome
my
friend
hamel
to
david
s
hall
chapter
xiii
during
the
next
hamel
was
introduced
to
luxuries
to
which
in
a
general
way
he
was
entirely
unaccustomed
one
was
busy
preparing
his
bath
in
a
room
leading
out
of
his
sleeping
apartment
while
another
brought
him
a
choice
of
evening
clothes
and
superintended
his
disrobing
hamel
always
observant
studied
his
surroundings
with
keen
interest
he
found
himself
in
a
queerly
mixed
atmosphere
of
luxurious
modernity
and
stately
antiquity
his
the
huge
couch
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
all
the
furniture
about
the
room
was
of
the
queen
anne
period
the
bathroom
which
communicated
with
his
apartment
was
the
latest
triumph
of
the
plumber
s
art
a
room
with
floor
and
walls
of
white
tiles
the
bath
itself
a
little
sunken
and
twice
the
ordinary
size
he
dispensed
so
far
as
he
could
with
the
services
of
the
men
and
descended
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
into
the
hall
meekins
was
waiting
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
dressed
now
in
somber
black
mr
fentolin
will
be
glad
if
you
will
step
into
his
room
sir
he
announced
leading
the
way
fentolin
was
seated
in
his
chair
reading
the
times
in
a
corner
of
his
library
shaped
blocks
had
been
placed
behind
and
in
front
of
the
wheels
of
his
little
vehicle
to
prevent
it
from
moving
a
shaded
stood
on
the
table
by
his
side
he
did
not
at
once
look
up
and
hamel
glanced
around
with
genuine
admiration
the
shelves
which
lined
the
walls
and
the
winged
cases
which
protruded
into
the
room
were
filled
with
books
there
was
a
large
oak
table
with
beautifully
carved
legs
piled
with
all
sorts
of
modern
reviews
and
magazines
a
log
fire
was
burning
in
the
big
oaken
grate
the
perfume
from
a
great
bowl
of
lavender
seemed
to
mingle
curiously
yet
pleasantly
with
the
half
musty
odour
of
the
old
volumes
the
massive
chimneypiece
was
of
black
oak
and
above
it
were
carved
the
arms
of
the
house
of
fentolin
the
walls
were
to
the
ceiling
refreshed
i
hope
by
your
bath
and
change
my
dear
visitor
the
head
of
the
house
remarked
as
he
laid
down
his
paper
draw
a
chair
up
here
and
join
me
in
a
glass
of
vermouth
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
it
it
comes
to
me
from
the
maker
as
a
special
hamel
accepted
a
full
of
the
amber
liquid
fentolin
sipped
his
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
this
he
continued
is
one
of
our
informal
days
there
is
no
one
in
the
house
save
my
niece
and
nephew
and
a
poor
invalid
gentleman
who
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
confined
to
his
bed
my
is
also
i
regret
to
say
indisposed
she
desired
me
to
present
her
excuses
to
you
and
say
how
greatly
she
is
looking
forward
to
making
your
acquaintance
during
the
next
few
hamel
bowed
it
is
very
kind
of
fentolin
he
murmured
on
these
occasions
fentolin
continued
we
do
not
make
use
of
a
my
niece
will
come
in
here
presently
you
are
looking
at
my
books
i
see
are
you
by
any
chance
a
bibliophile
i
have
a
case
of
manuscripts
here
which
might
interest
hamel
shook
his
head
only
in
the
abstract
i
fear
he
answered
i
have
scarcely
opened
a
serious
book
since
i
was
at
what
was
your
year
fentolin
asked
fourteen
years
ago
i
left
magdalen
hamel
replied
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
be
an
engineer
and
i
went
over
to
the
boston
institute
of
fentolin
nodded
appreciatively
a
magnificent
profession
he
murmured
a
healthy
one
too
i
should
judge
from
your
appearance
you
are
a
strong
man
i
have
had
reason
to
be
hamel
rejoined
during
nearly
the
whole
of
the
time
i
have
been
abroad
i
have
been
practically
pioneering
building
railways
in
the
far
west
with
gangs
of
chinese
and
italians
and
hungarians
and
scarcely
a
foreman
who
isn
t
terrified
of
his
job
isn
t
exactly
you
are
going
back
there
fentolin
asked
with
interest
hamel
shook
his
head
i
have
no
plans
he
declared
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
or
shall
i
some
day
say
unfortunate
enough
i
wonder
to
have
inherited
a
large
fentolin
smiled
don
t
ever
doubt
your
good
fortune
he
said
earnestly
the
longer
i
live
and
in
my
limited
way
i
do
see
a
good
deal
of
life
the
more
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
there
isn
t
anything
in
this
world
that
compares
with
the
power
of
money
i
distrust
a
poor
man
he
may
mean
to
be
honest
but
he
is
at
all
times
subject
to
temptation
ah
here
is
my
fentolin
turned
towards
the
door
hamel
rose
at
once
to
his
feet
his
surmise
then
had
been
correct
she
was
coming
towards
them
very
quietly
in
her
soft
grey
her
brown
hair
smoothly
brushed
back
a
pearl
necklace
around
her
long
delicate
neck
she
seemed
to
him
a
very
exquisite
embodiment
of
those
memories
which
he
had
been
carrying
about
throughout
the
afternoon
here
hamel
his
host
said
is
a
member
of
my
family
who
has
been
a
deserter
for
a
short
time
this
is
richard
hamel
esther
my
niece
miss
esther
she
held
out
her
hand
with
the
faintest
possible
smile
which
might
have
been
of
greeting
or
recognition
i
travelled
for
some
distance
in
the
train
with
hamel
this
afternoon
i
think
she
remarked
indeed
fentolin
exclaimed
dear
me
that
is
very
interesting
very
interesting
indeed
hamel
i
am
sure
did
not
tell
you
of
his
destination
he
watched
them
keenly
hamel
though
he
scarcely
understood
was
quick
to
appreciate
the
possible
significance
of
that
tentative
question
we
did
not
exchange
confidences
he
observed
miss
fentolin
only
changed
into
my
carriage
during
the
last
few
minutes
of
her
journey
besides
he
continued
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
ideas
as
to
my
destination
were
a
little
hazy
to
come
and
look
for
some
queer
sort
of
building
by
the
side
of
the
sea
which
has
been
unoccupied
for
a
dozen
years
or
so
scarcely
seems
a
reasonable
quest
does
it
scarcely
indeed
fentolin
assented
you
may
thank
me
hamel
for
the
fact
that
the
place
is
not
in
ruins
my
blatant
trespassing
has
saved
you
from
that
at
least
after
dinner
we
must
talk
further
about
the
tower
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
use
of
the
little
the
sound
of
the
dinner
gong
boomed
through
the
house
a
moment
later
gerald
entered
followed
by
a
butler
announcing
dinner
the
only
remaining
member
of
my
family
fentolin
remarked
indicating
his
nephew
gerald
you
will
be
pleased
i
know
to
meet
hamel
hamel
has
been
a
great
traveller
long
before
you
can
remember
his
father
used
to
paint
wonderful
pictures
of
this
gerald
shook
hands
with
his
visitor
his
face
for
a
moment
lighted
up
he
was
looking
pale
though
and
singularly
sullen
and
dejected
there
are
two
of
your
father
s
pictures
in
the
modern
side
of
the
gallery
he
remarked
a
little
diffidently
they
are
great
favourites
with
everybody
they
all
went
in
to
dinner
together
meekins
who
had
appeared
silently
had
glided
unnoticed
behind
his
master
s
chair
and
wheeled
it
across
the
hall
a
partie
carree
fentolin
declared
i
have
a
resident
doctor
here
a
very
delightful
person
who
often
dines
with
us
but
i
thought
not
five
is
an
awkward
number
i
want
to
get
to
know
you
better
hamel
and
quickly
i
want
you
too
to
make
friends
with
my
niece
and
nephew
hamel
s
father
he
went
on
addressing
the
two
latter
and
your
father
were
great
friends
have
i
told
you
both
exactly
why
hamel
is
a
guest
here
why
he
came
to
these
parts
at
all
no
listen
then
he
came
to
take
possession
of
the
tower
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
belongs
to
him
too
his
father
bought
it
from
your
father
more
years
ago
than
we
should
care
to
talk
about
i
have
really
been
a
trespasser
all
this
they
took
their
places
at
a
small
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
the
shaded
lights
thrown
downwards
upon
the
table
seemed
to
leave
most
of
the
rest
of
the
apartment
in
the
gloomy
faces
of
the
men
and
women
whose
pictures
hung
upon
the
walls
were
almost
invisible
the
servants
themselves
standing
a
little
outside
the
halo
of
light
were
like
shadows
passing
swiftly
and
noiselessly
back
and
forth
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
an
organ
and
to
the
left
a
little
balcony
built
out
as
though
for
an
orchestra
hamel
looked
about
him
almost
in
wonderment
there
was
something
curiously
impressive
in
the
size
of
the
apartment
and
its
emptiness
a
trespasser
fentolin
continued
as
he
took
up
the
menu
and
criticised
it
through
his
eyeglass
that
is
what
i
have
been
without
a
but
for
your
interest
and
consequent
trespass
hamel
remarked
i
should
probably
have
found
the
roof
off
and
the
whole
place
in
instead
of
which
you
found
the
door
locked
against
you
fentolin
pointed
out
well
we
shall
see
i
might
at
any
rate
have
lost
the
opportunity
of
entertaining
you
here
this
evening
i
am
particularly
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
making
you
known
to
my
niece
and
nephew
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
here
are
two
young
people
who
are
highly
to
be
commended
i
can
not
offer
them
a
cheerful
life
here
there
is
little
society
no
gaiety
no
sort
of
excitement
yet
they
never
leave
me
they
seem
to
have
no
other
interest
in
life
but
to
be
always
at
my
beck
and
call
a
case
hamel
of
really
touching
devotion
if
anything
could
reconcile
me
to
my
miserable
condition
it
would
be
the
kindness
and
consideration
of
those
by
whom
i
am
hamel
murmured
a
few
words
of
cordial
agreement
yet
he
found
himself
in
a
sense
embarrassed
gerald
was
looking
down
upon
his
plate
and
his
face
was
hidden
esther
s
features
had
suddenly
become
stony
and
expressionless
hamel
felt
instinctively
that
something
was
wrong
there
are
compensations
fentolin
continued
with
the
air
of
one
enjoying
speech
which
find
their
way
into
even
the
gloomiest
of
lives
as
i
lie
on
my
back
hour
after
hour
i
feel
all
the
more
conscious
of
this
the
world
is
a
school
of
compensations
hamel
the
interests
the
mental
interests
i
mean
of
unfortunate
people
like
myself
come
to
possess
in
time
a
peculiar
significance
and
to
yield
a
peculiar
pleasure
i
have
hobbies
hamel
i
frankly
admit
it
without
my
hobbies
i
shudder
to
think
what
might
become
of
me
i
might
become
a
selfish
cruel
misanthropical
person
hobbies
are
indeed
a
great
the
brother
and
sister
sat
still
in
stony
silence
hamel
looking
across
the
little
table
with
its
glittering
load
of
cut
glass
and
silver
and
scarlet
flowers
caught
something
in
esther
s
eyes
so
rarely
expressive
of
any
emotion
whatever
which
puzzled
him
he
looked
swiftly
back
at
his
host
fentolin
s
face
at
that
moment
was
like
a
beautiful
cameo
his
expression
was
one
of
gentle
benevolence
let
me
be
quite
frank
with
you
fentolin
murmured
my
occupation
of
the
tower
is
one
of
these
hobbies
i
love
to
sit
there
within
a
few
yards
of
the
sea
and
watch
the
tide
come
in
i
catch
something
of
the
spirit
i
think
which
caught
your
father
hamel
and
kept
him
a
prisoner
here
in
my
small
way
i
too
paint
while
i
am
down
there
paint
and
dream
these
things
may
not
appeal
to
you
but
you
must
remember
that
there
are
few
things
left
to
me
in
life
and
that
those
therefore
which
i
can
make
use
of
are
dear
to
me
gerald
you
are
silent
how
is
it
that
you
say
nothing
i
am
tired
sir
the
boy
answered
quietly
fentolin
nodded
gravely
it
is
inexcusable
of
me
he
declared
smoothly
to
have
forgotten
even
for
a
moment
my
nephew
hamel
he
went
on
had
quite
an
exciting
experience
last
night
or
rather
a
series
of
experiences
he
was
first
of
all
in
a
railway
accident
and
then
for
the
sake
of
a
poor
fellow
who
was
with
him
and
who
was
badly
hurt
he
motored
back
here
in
the
grey
hours
of
the
morning
and
ran
they
tell
me
considerable
risk
of
being
drowned
on
the
marshes
a
very
wonderful
and
praiseworthy
adventure
i
consider
it
i
trust
that
our
friend
when
he
recovers
will
be
properly
gerald
rose
to
his
feet
precipitately
the
service
of
dinner
was
almost
concluded
and
he
muttered
something
which
sounded
like
an
excuse
fentolin
however
stretched
out
his
hand
and
motioned
him
to
resume
his
seat
my
dear
gerald
he
exclaimed
reprovingly
you
would
leave
us
so
abruptly
before
your
sister
too
what
will
hamel
think
of
our
country
ways
pray
resume
your
for
a
moment
the
boy
stood
quite
still
then
he
slowly
subsided
into
his
chair
fentolin
passed
around
a
decanter
of
wine
which
had
been
placed
upon
the
table
by
the
butler
the
servants
had
now
left
the
room
you
must
excuse
my
nephew
if
you
please
hamel
he
begged
gerald
has
a
boy
s
curious
aversion
to
praise
in
any
form
i
am
looking
forward
to
hearing
your
verdict
upon
my
port
the
collection
of
wine
and
pictures
was
a
hobby
of
my
grandfather
s
for
which
we
his
descendants
can
never
be
sufficiently
hamel
praised
his
wine
as
indeed
he
had
every
reason
to
but
for
a
few
moments
the
smooth
conversation
of
his
host
fell
upon
deaf
ears
he
looked
from
the
boy
s
face
pale
and
wrinkled
as
though
with
some
sort
of
suppressed
pain
to
the
girl
s
still
stony
expression
this
was
indeed
a
house
of
mysteries
there
was
something
here
incomprehensible
some
thing
about
the
relations
of
these
three
and
their
knowledge
of
one
another
utterly
baffling
it
was
the
queerest
household
surely
into
which
any
stranger
had
ever
been
precipitated
the
planting
of
trees
and
the
laying
down
of
port
are
two
virtues
in
our
ancestors
which
have
never
been
properly
appreciated
fentolin
continued
let
us
at
any
rate
free
ourselves
from
the
reproach
of
ingratitude
so
far
as
regards
my
grandfather
gerald
fentolin
to
whom
i
believe
we
are
indebted
for
this
wine
we
will
drink
fentolin
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
the
august
calm
of
the
great
house
had
been
suddenly
broken
from
came
the
tumult
of
raised
voices
the
slamming
of
a
door
the
falling
of
something
heavy
upon
the
floor
fentolin
listened
with
a
grim
change
in
his
expression
his
smile
had
departed
his
lower
lip
was
thrust
out
his
eyebrows
met
he
raised
the
little
whistle
which
hung
from
his
chain
at
that
moment
however
the
door
was
opened
doctor
sarson
appeared
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
fentolin
he
said
but
our
patient
is
becoming
a
little
difficult
the
concussion
has
left
him
as
i
feared
it
might
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitability
he
insists
upon
an
interview
with
fentolin
backed
his
little
chair
from
the
table
the
doctor
came
over
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
handle
you
will
i
am
sure
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
hamel
his
host
begged
my
niece
and
nephew
will
do
their
best
to
entertain
you
now
sarson
i
am
fentolin
glided
across
the
dim
empty
spaces
of
the
splendid
apartment
followed
by
the
doctor
a
ghostly
little
procession
it
seemed
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
for
a
few
moments
a
curious
silence
ensued
gerald
remained
tense
and
apparently
suffering
from
some
sort
of
suppressed
emotion
esther
for
the
first
time
moved
in
her
place
she
leaned
towards
hamel
her
lips
were
slowly
parted
her
eyes
sought
the
door
as
though
in
terror
her
voice
although
save
for
themselves
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
whole
of
that
great
apartment
had
sunk
to
the
lowest
of
whispers
are
you
a
brave
man
hamel
she
asked
he
was
staggered
but
he
answered
her
promptly
i
believe
don
t
give
up
the
tower
just
yet
that
is
what
he
has
brought
you
here
for
he
wants
you
to
give
it
up
and
go
back
don
t
the
earnestness
of
her
words
was
unmistakable
hamel
felt
the
thrill
of
coming
events
why
not
don
t
ask
me
she
begged
only
if
you
are
brave
if
you
have
feeling
for
others
keep
the
tower
if
it
be
for
only
a
week
hush
the
door
had
been
noiselessly
opened
the
doctor
appeared
and
advanced
to
the
table
with
a
grave
little
bow
mr
fentolin
he
said
has
been
kind
enough
to
suggest
that
i
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
you
my
presence
is
not
needed
hamel
he
added
i
am
glad
sir
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
have
for
a
long
time
been
a
great
admirer
of
your
father
s
he
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
filling
his
glass
bowed
towards
hamel
once
more
gerald
and
his
sister
relapsed
almost
automatically
into
an
indifferent
and
cultivated
silence
hamel
found
civility
towards
the
newcomer
difficult
unconsciously
his
attitude
became
that
of
the
other
two
he
resented
the
intrusion
he
found
himself
regarding
the
advent
of
doctor
sarson
as
possessing
some
secondary
significance
it
was
almost
as
though
fentolin
preferred
not
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
niece
and
nephew
nevertheless
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
clear
and
firm
chapter
xiv
fentolin
on
leaving
the
steered
his
chair
with
great
precision
through
the
open
doors
of
a
small
lift
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
which
doctor
sarson
who
stepped
in
with
him
promptly
directed
to
the
second
floor
here
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
dunster
was
lying
doctor
sarson
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
almost
immediately
he
stood
at
one
side
out
of
sight
of
dunster
and
nodded
to
fentolin
if
there
is
any
trouble
he
whispered
send
for
me
i
am
better
away
for
the
present
my
presence
only
excites
fentolin
nodded
you
are
right
he
said
go
down
into
the
i
am
not
sure
about
that
fellow
hamel
and
gerald
is
in
a
queer
temper
stay
with
them
see
that
they
are
not
the
doctor
silently
withdrew
and
fentolin
promptly
glided
past
him
into
the
room
john
dunster
in
his
night
clothes
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
him
watching
him
all
the
time
with
the
subtle
intentness
of
a
cat
watching
a
mouse
stood
meekins
dunster
s
head
was
still
bound
although
the
bandage
had
slipped
a
little
apparently
in
some
struggle
his
face
was
chalklike
and
he
was
breathing
quickly
so
you
ve
come
at
last
he
exclaimed
a
little
truculently
are
you
fentolin
fentolin
gravely
admitted
his
identity
his
eyes
rested
upon
his
guest
with
an
air
of
tender
interest
his
face
was
almost
beautiful
you
are
the
owner
of
this
house
i
am
underneath
your
roof
is
that
so
this
is
certainly
david
s
hall
fentolin
replied
it
really
appears
as
though
your
conclusions
were
then
will
you
tell
me
why
i
am
kept
a
prisoner
here
fentolin
s
expression
was
for
a
moment
clouded
he
seemed
hurt
a
prisoner
he
repeated
softly
my
dear
dunster
you
have
surely
forgotten
the
circumstances
which
procured
for
me
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
the
condition
in
which
you
arrived
here
only
after
all
a
very
few
hours
ago
the
circumstances
dunster
declared
drily
are
to
me
still
inexplicable
at
liverpool
street
station
i
was
accosted
by
a
young
man
who
informed
me
that
his
name
was
gerald
fentolin
and
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
hague
to
play
in
a
golf
tournament
his
story
seemed
entirely
probable
and
i
permitted
him
a
seat
in
the
special
train
i
had
chartered
for
harwich
there
was
an
accident
and
i
received
this
blow
to
my
head
only
a
trifling
affair
after
all
i
come
to
my
senses
to
find
myself
here
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
part
of
the
world
you
call
this
but
from
the
fact
that
i
can
see
the
sea
from
my
window
it
must
be
some
considerable
distance
from
the
scene
of
the
accident
i
find
that
my
has
been
opened
my
examined
and
i
am
apparently
a
prisoner
i
ask
you
fentolin
for
an
fentolin
smiled
reassuringly
my
dear
sir
he
said
my
dear
dunster
i
believe
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
calling
you
your
conclusions
seem
to
me
just
a
little
melodramatic
my
nephew
gerald
fentolin
did
what
i
consider
the
natural
thing
under
the
circumstances
you
had
been
courteous
to
him
and
he
repaid
the
obligation
to
the
best
of
his
ability
the
accident
to
your
train
happened
in
a
dreary
part
of
the
country
some
thirty
miles
from
here
my
nephew
adopted
a
course
which
i
think
under
the
circumstances
was
the
natural
and
hospitable
one
he
brought
you
to
his
home
there
was
no
hospital
or
town
of
any
importance
very
well
dunster
decided
i
will
accept
your
version
of
the
affair
i
will
then
up
to
this
point
acknowledge
myself
your
debtor
but
will
you
tell
me
why
my
has
been
opened
my
clothes
removed
and
a
containing
papers
of
great
importance
to
me
has
been
tampered
with
my
dear
dunster
his
host
repelled
calmly
you
surely
can
not
imagine
that
you
are
among
thieves
your
was
opened
and
the
contents
of
your
inspected
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
your
address
or
the
names
of
some
friends
with
whom
we
might
am
i
to
understand
that
they
are
to
be
restored
to
me
then
dunster
demanded
without
a
doubt
yes
fentolin
assured
him
you
however
are
not
fit
for
anything
at
the
present
moment
but
to
return
to
your
bed
from
which
i
understand
you
rose
rather
suddenly
a
few
minutes
on
the
contrary
dunster
insisted
i
am
feeling
absolutely
well
enough
to
travel
i
have
an
appointment
on
the
continent
of
great
importance
as
you
may
judge
by
the
fact
that
at
liverpool
street
i
chartered
a
special
train
i
trust
that
nothing
in
my
manner
may
have
given
you
offence
but
i
am
anxious
to
get
through
with
the
business
which
brought
me
over
to
this
side
of
the
water
i
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
that
my
and
clothes
be
at
once
restored
to
me
and
that
i
be
provided
with
the
means
of
continuing
my
journey
without
a
moment
s
further
fentolin
shook
his
head
very
gently
very
regretfully
but
also
firmly
mr
dunster
he
pleaded
do
be
reasonable
think
of
all
you
have
been
through
i
can
quite
sympathise
with
you
in
your
impatience
but
i
am
forced
to
tell
you
that
the
doctor
who
has
been
attending
you
since
the
moment
you
were
brought
into
this
house
has
absolutely
forbidden
anything
of
the
dunster
seemed
for
a
moment
to
struggle
for
composure
i
am
an
american
citizen
he
declared
i
am
willing
to
listen
to
the
advice
of
any
physician
but
so
long
as
i
take
the
risk
i
am
not
bound
to
follow
it
in
the
present
case
i
decline
to
follow
it
i
ask
for
facilities
to
leave
this
house
at
fentolin
sighed
in
your
own
interests
he
said
calmly
they
will
not
be
granted
to
dunster
had
spoken
all
the
time
like
a
man
struggling
to
preserve
his
there
were
signs
now
that
his
will
was
ceasing
to
serve
him
his
eyes
flashed
fire
his
voice
was
raised
will
not
be
granted
to
me
he
repeated
do
you
mean
to
say
then
that
i
am
to
be
kept
here
against
my
will
fentolin
made
no
immediate
reply
with
the
delicate
fingers
of
his
right
hand
he
pushed
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
he
looked
at
his
questioner
soothingly
as
one
might
look
at
a
spoiled
child
against
my
will
dunster
repeated
raising
his
voice
still
higher
mr
fentolin
if
the
truth
must
be
told
i
have
heard
of
you
before
and
been
warned
against
you
i
decline
to
accept
any
longer
the
hospitality
of
your
roof
i
insist
upon
leaving
it
if
you
will
not
provide
me
with
any
means
of
doing
so
i
will
he
made
a
motion
as
though
to
rise
from
the
bed
meekins
hand
very
gently
closed
upon
his
arm
one
could
judge
that
the
grip
was
like
a
grip
of
iron
dear
me
fentolin
said
this
is
really
very
unreasonable
of
you
if
you
have
heard
of
me
dunster
you
ought
to
understand
that
notwithstanding
my
unfortunate
physical
trouble
i
am
a
person
of
consequence
and
position
in
this
county
i
am
a
magistrate
sheriff
and
a
great
here
i
think
i
may
say
without
boasting
that
i
represent
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
in
this
country
why
therefore
should
you
treat
me
as
though
it
were
to
my
interest
to
inveigle
you
under
my
roof
and
keep
you
there
for
some
guilty
purpose
can
not
you
understand
that
it
is
for
your
own
good
i
hesitate
to
part
with
you
i
understand
nothing
of
the
sort
dunster
exclaimed
angrily
let
us
bring
this
nonsense
to
an
end
i
want
my
clothes
and
if
you
won
t
lend
me
a
car
or
a
trap
i
ll
walk
to
the
nearest
railway
fentolin
shook
his
head
i
am
quite
sure
he
said
that
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
travel
even
in
the
just
now
i
heard
a
disturbance
for
which
i
was
told
that
you
were
i
simply
insisted
upon
having
my
clothes
dunster
explained
your
servant
refused
to
fetch
them
perhaps
i
lost
my
temper
if
so
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
used
to
being
a
few
days
rest
fentolin
began
a
few
days
rest
be
hanged
dunster
interrupted
fiercely
listen
fentolin
he
added
with
the
air
of
one
making
a
last
effort
to
preserve
his
temper
the
mission
with
which
i
am
charged
is
one
of
greater
importance
than
you
can
imagine
so
much
depends
upon
it
that
my
own
life
if
that
is
in
danger
would
be
a
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
issues
involved
if
i
am
not
allowed
to
continue
upon
my
journey
at
once
the
consequences
may
be
more
serious
than
i
can
tell
you
to
you
and
yours
to
your
own
country
there
i
am
telling
you
a
great
deal
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
am
in
earnest
i
have
a
mission
which
i
must
perform
and
which
i
must
perform
you
are
very
mysterious
fentolin
murmured
i
will
leave
nothing
to
chance
dunster
continued
send
this
man
who
seems
to
have
constituted
himself
my
jailer
out
of
earshot
and
i
will
tell
you
even
fentolin
turned
to
meekins
you
can
leave
the
room
for
a
moment
he
ordered
wait
upon
the
meekins
very
unwillingly
turned
to
obey
you
will
excuse
me
sir
he
objected
doubtfully
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
he
is
fentolin
smiled
faintly
you
need
have
no
fear
meekins
he
declared
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
are
mistaken
i
think
that
dunster
is
incapable
of
any
act
of
violence
towards
a
person
in
my
unfortunate
position
i
am
willing
to
trust
myself
with
him
perfectly
willing
meekins
with
ponderous
footsteps
left
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
fentolin
leaned
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
on
springs
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
had
disappeared
in
the
pocket
of
his
black
velvet
he
was
certainly
prepared
for
all
emergencies
now
dunster
he
said
softly
you
can
speak
to
me
without
dunster
dropped
his
voice
his
tone
became
one
of
fierce
eagerness
look
here
he
exclaimed
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
force
me
to
give
myself
away
like
this
but
after
all
you
are
an
englishman
with
a
stake
in
your
country
and
i
presume
you
don
t
want
her
to
take
a
back
seat
for
the
next
few
generations
listen
here
it
s
to
save
your
country
that
i
want
to
get
to
the
hague
without
a
second
s
delay
i
tell
you
that
if
i
don
t
get
there
if
the
message
i
convey
doesn
t
reach
its
destination
you
may
find
an
agreement
signed
between
certain
powers
which
will
mean
the
greatest
diplomatic
humiliation
which
great
britain
has
ever
known
aye
and
more
than
that
dunster
continued
it
may
be
that
the
bogey
you
ve
been
setting
before
yourself
for
all
these
years
may
trot
out
into
life
and
you
may
find
david
s
hall
a
barrack
for
german
soldiers
before
many
months
have
fentolin
shook
his
head
in
gentle
disbelief
you
are
speaking
to
one
he
declared
who
knows
more
of
the
political
situation
than
you
imagine
in
my
younger
days
i
was
in
the
foreign
office
since
my
unfortunate
accident
i
have
preserved
the
keenest
interest
in
politics
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
do
not
believe
you
as
the
powers
are
grouped
at
present
i
do
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
successful
invasion
of
this
perhaps
not
dunster
replied
eagerly
but
the
grouping
of
the
powers
as
it
has
existed
during
the
last
few
years
is
on
the
eve
of
a
great
change
i
can
not
take
you
wholly
into
my
confidence
i
can
only
give
you
my
word
of
honour
as
a
friend
to
your
country
that
the
message
i
carry
is
her
only
salvation
having
told
you
as
much
as
that
i
do
not
think
i
am
asking
too
much
if
i
ask
you
for
my
clothes
and
and
for
the
fastest
you
can
furnish
me
with
i
guess
i
can
get
from
here
to
yarmouth
and
from
there
i
can
charter
something
which
will
take
me
to
the
other
fentolin
raised
the
little
gold
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
it
very
softly
meekins
at
once
entered
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
moved
silently
to
the
side
of
the
man
who
had
risen
now
from
the
bed
and
who
was
standing
with
his
hand
grasping
the
post
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
fentolin
as
though
awaiting
his
answer
our
conversation
the
latter
said
calmly
has
reached
a
point
dunster
at
which
i
think
we
may
leave
it
for
the
moment
you
have
told
me
some
very
surprising
things
i
perceive
that
you
are
a
more
interesting
visitor
even
than
i
had
he
raised
his
left
hand
and
meekins
who
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
some
signal
of
the
sort
suddenly
with
a
movement
of
his
knee
and
right
arm
flung
dunster
back
upon
the
bed
the
man
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
but
already
with
dexterity
his
assailant
had
inserted
a
gag
between
his
teeth
treating
his
struggles
as
the
struggles
of
a
baby
meekins
next
proceeded
to
secure
his
wrists
with
handcuffs
he
then
held
his
feet
together
while
he
quietly
wound
a
coil
of
cord
around
them
fentolin
watched
the
proceedings
from
his
chair
with
an
air
of
pleased
and
critical
interest
very
well
done
meekins
very
neatly
done
indeed
he
exclaimed
as
i
was
saying
dunster
he
continued
turning
his
chair
our
conversation
has
reached
a
point
at
which
i
think
we
may
safely
leave
it
for
a
time
we
will
discuss
these
matters
again
your
pretext
of
a
political
mission
is
of
course
an
absurd
one
but
fortunately
you
have
fallen
into
good
hands
take
good
care
of
dunster
meekins
i
can
see
that
he
is
a
very
important
personage
we
must
be
careful
not
to
lose
sight
of
fentolin
steered
his
chair
to
the
door
opened
it
and
passed
out
on
the
landing
he
blew
his
whistle
the
lift
almost
immediately
ascended
a
moment
or
two
later
he
glided
into
the
the
three
men
were
still
seated
around
the
table
a
decanter
of
wine
almost
empty
was
before
doctor
sarson
whose
pallid
cheeks
however
were
as
yet
unflushed
at
last
my
dear
guest
fentolin
exclaimed
turning
to
hamel
i
am
able
to
return
to
you
if
you
will
drink
no
more
wine
let
us
have
our
coffee
in
the
library
you
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
chapter
xv
fentolin
led
the
way
to
a
delightful
little
corner
of
his
library
where
before
the
open
grate
recently
piled
with
hissing
logs
an
easy
chair
had
been
drawn
he
wheeled
himself
up
to
the
other
side
of
the
hearthrug
and
leaned
back
with
a
little
air
of
exhaustion
the
butler
who
seemed
to
have
appeared
unsummoned
from
somewhere
among
the
shadows
served
coffee
and
poured
some
old
brandy
into
large
and
wonderfully
thin
glasses
why
my
house
should
be
turned
into
an
asylum
to
gratify
the
hospitable
instincts
of
my
young
nephew
i
can
not
imagine
fentolin
grumbled
a
most
extraordinary
person
our
visitor
i
can
assure
you
quite
violent
too
he
was
at
have
you
had
any
outside
advice
about
his
condition
hamel
inquired
fentolin
glanced
across
those
few
feet
of
space
and
looked
at
hamel
with
swift
suspicion
why
should
i
he
asked
doctor
sarson
is
fully
qualified
and
the
case
seems
to
present
no
unusual
hamel
sipped
his
brandy
thoughtfully
i
don
t
know
why
i
suggested
it
he
admitted
i
only
thought
that
an
outside
doctor
might
help
you
to
get
rid
of
the
fentolin
shrugged
his
shoulders
after
all
he
said
the
matter
is
of
no
real
consequence
doctor
sarson
assures
me
that
we
shall
be
able
to
send
him
on
his
way
very
shortly
in
the
meantime
hamel
what
about
the
tower
what
about
it
hamel
asked
selecting
a
cigar
from
the
box
which
had
been
pushed
to
his
side
i
am
sure
i
haven
t
any
wish
to
inconvenience
i
will
be
quite
frank
fentolin
declared
i
do
not
dispute
your
right
for
a
moment
on
the
other
hand
my
few
hours
daily
down
there
have
become
a
habit
with
me
i
do
not
wish
to
give
them
up
stay
here
with
us
hamel
you
will
be
doing
us
a
great
kindness
my
nephew
and
niece
have
too
little
congenial
society
make
up
your
mind
to
give
us
a
fortnight
of
your
time
and
i
can
assure
you
that
we
will
do
our
best
to
make
yours
a
pleasant
hamel
was
a
little
taken
aback
mr
fentolin
he
said
i
couldn
t
think
of
accepting
your
hospitality
to
such
an
extent
my
idea
in
coming
here
was
simply
to
fulfil
an
old
promise
to
my
father
and
to
rough
it
at
the
tower
for
a
week
or
so
and
when
that
was
over
i
don
t
suppose
i
should
ever
be
likely
to
come
back
again
you
had
better
let
me
carry
out
that
plan
and
afterwards
the
place
shall
be
entirely
at
your
you
don
t
quite
understand
fentolin
persisted
a
little
irritably
i
sit
there
every
morning
i
want
for
instance
to
be
there
morning
and
the
next
morning
and
the
morning
afterwards
to
finish
a
little
seascape
i
have
commenced
nowhere
else
will
do
call
it
a
whim
or
what
you
will
i
have
begun
the
picture
and
i
want
to
finish
well
you
can
sit
there
all
right
hamel
assured
him
i
shall
be
out
playing
golf
or
fishing
i
shall
do
nothing
but
sleep
and
very
uncomfortable
you
will
be
fentolin
pointed
out
you
have
no
servant
i
understand
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
village
fit
to
look
after
you
think
of
my
empty
rooms
my
books
here
my
gardens
my
my
young
people
entirely
at
your
service
you
can
have
a
suite
to
yourself
you
can
disappear
when
you
like
to
all
effects
and
purposes
you
will
be
the
master
of
david
s
hall
be
reasonable
don
t
you
think
now
that
you
can
spend
a
fortnight
more
pleasantly
under
such
circumstances
than
by
playing
the
misanthrope
down
at
the
tower
please
don
t
think
hamel
begged
that
i
don
t
appreciate
your
hospitality
i
should
feel
uncomfortable
however
if
i
paid
you
a
visit
of
the
length
you
have
suggested
come
i
don
t
see
he
added
why
my
occupation
of
the
tower
should
interfere
with
you
i
should
be
away
from
it
by
about
nine
or
ten
o
clock
every
morning
i
should
probably
only
sleep
there
can
t
you
accept
the
use
of
it
all
the
rest
of
the
time
i
can
assure
you
that
you
will
be
welcome
to
come
and
go
as
though
it
were
entirely
your
fentolin
had
lit
a
cigarette
and
was
watching
the
blue
smoke
curl
upwards
to
the
ceiling
you
re
an
obstinate
man
hamel
he
sighed
but
i
suppose
you
must
have
your
own
way
you
would
only
need
to
use
the
room
and
the
you
will
not
need
the
outhouse
rather
more
than
an
outhouse
though
isn
t
it
i
mean
the
shed
which
leads
out
from
the
kitchen
where
the
lifeboat
used
to
be
kept
i
don
t
think
i
shall
need
that
hamel
admitted
a
little
hesitatingly
to
tell
you
the
truth
fentolin
continued
among
my
other
hobbies
i
have
done
a
little
inventing
i
work
sometimes
at
a
model
there
it
is
foolish
perhaps
but
i
wish
no
one
to
see
it
do
you
mind
if
i
keep
the
keys
of
the
place
not
in
the
least
hamel
replied
tell
me
what
direction
do
your
inventions
take
fentolin
before
you
go
fentolin
promised
i
will
show
you
my
little
model
at
work
until
then
we
will
not
talk
of
it
now
come
be
frank
with
me
shall
we
exchange
ideas
for
a
little
time
will
you
talk
of
books
they
are
my
daily
friends
i
have
thousands
of
them
beloved
companions
on
every
side
or
will
you
talk
of
politics
or
travel
or
would
you
rather
be
frivolous
with
my
niece
and
nephew
that
i
think
is
esther
to
be
quite
frank
hamel
declared
bluntly
i
should
like
to
talk
to
your
fentolin
smiled
as
though
amused
his
amusement
however
was
perfectly
if
you
will
open
this
door
he
said
you
will
see
another
one
exactly
opposite
to
you
that
is
the
you
will
find
esther
there
before
you
go
will
you
pass
me
the
quarterly
review
thank
hamel
crossed
the
hall
opened
the
door
of
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
directed
and
made
his
way
towards
the
piano
esther
was
there
playing
softly
to
herself
with
eyes
half
closed
he
came
and
stood
by
her
side
and
she
stopped
abruptly
her
eyes
questioned
him
then
her
fingers
stole
once
more
over
the
keys
more
softly
still
i
have
just
left
your
uncle
hamel
said
he
told
me
that
i
might
come
in
yes
she
murmured
he
was
very
hospitable
hamel
continued
he
wanted
me
to
remain
here
as
a
guest
and
not
go
to
the
tower
at
and
you
i
am
going
to
the
tower
he
said
i
am
going
there
or
the
day
the
music
swelled
beneath
her
fingers
for
how
long
for
a
week
or
so
i
am
just
giving
your
uncle
time
to
clear
out
his
belongings
i
am
leaving
him
the
he
asked
you
to
leave
him
that
she
whispered
yes
you
are
not
going
in
there
at
all
not
at
again
she
played
a
little
more
loudly
for
a
few
moments
then
the
music
died
away
once
more
what
reason
did
he
give
for
keeping
possession
of
that
another
hobby
hamel
replied
he
is
an
inventor
it
seems
he
has
the
model
of
something
there
he
would
not
tell
me
she
shivered
a
little
and
her
music
drifted
away
she
bent
over
the
keys
her
face
hidden
from
him
you
will
not
go
away
just
yet
she
asked
softly
you
are
going
to
stay
for
a
few
days
at
any
rate
without
a
doubt
he
assured
her
i
am
altogether
my
own
thank
god
she
murmured
he
leaned
with
his
elbow
against
the
top
of
the
piano
looking
down
at
her
since
dinnertime
she
had
fastened
a
large
red
rose
in
the
front
of
her
gown
do
you
know
that
this
is
all
rather
mysterious
he
said
calmly
what
is
mysterious
she
demanded
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
your
uncle
s
queer
aversion
to
my
having
the
tower
your
visitor
who
fights
with
the
servants
while
we
are
at
dinner
your
uncle
himself
whose
will
seems
to
be
law
not
only
to
you
but
to
your
brother
who
must
be
of
age
i
should
think
and
who
seems
to
have
plenty
of
we
live
here
both
of
us
she
told
him
he
is
our
naturally
hamel
replied
and
yet
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
of
course
but
at
dinnertime
i
seemed
to
get
a
queer
tell
it
me
she
insisted
her
fingers
breaking
suddenly
into
a
livelier
melody
tell
it
me
at
once
you
were
there
all
the
time
i
could
see
you
watching
tell
me
what
you
thought
she
had
turned
her
head
now
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
they
were
large
and
soft
capable
he
knew
of
infinite
expression
yet
at
that
moment
the
light
that
shone
from
them
was
simply
one
of
fear
half
curious
half
shrinking
my
impression
he
said
was
that
both
of
you
disliked
and
feared
fentolin
yet
for
some
reason
or
other
that
you
were
his
abject
her
fingers
seemed
suddenly
inspired
with
diabolical
strength
and
energy
strange
chords
crashed
and
broke
beneath
them
she
played
some
unfamiliar
music
with
tense
and
fierce
energy
suddenly
she
paused
and
rose
to
her
feet
come
out
on
to
the
terrace
she
invited
you
are
not
afraid
of
cold
he
followed
her
without
a
word
she
opened
the
french
windows
and
they
stepped
out
on
to
the
long
broad
stone
promenade
the
night
was
dark
and
there
was
little
to
be
seen
the
light
was
burning
at
the
entrance
to
the
waterway
a
few
lights
were
twinkling
from
the
village
the
soft
moaning
of
the
sea
was
distinctly
audible
she
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
palisading
he
followed
her
closely
you
are
right
hamel
she
said
i
think
that
i
am
more
afraid
of
him
than
any
woman
ever
was
of
any
man
in
this
then
why
do
you
live
here
he
protested
you
must
have
other
relations
to
whom
you
could
go
and
your
brother
why
doesn
t
he
do
something
go
into
one
of
the
professions
he
could
surely
leave
easily
enough
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
she
answered
calmly
perhaps
it
will
help
you
to
understand
you
know
my
uncle
s
condition
you
know
that
it
was
the
result
of
an
accident
i
have
heard
so
he
replied
gravely
she
clutched
at
his
arm
come
she
said
side
by
side
they
walked
the
entire
length
of
the
terrace
when
they
reached
the
corner
they
were
met
with
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
she
battled
along
and
he
followed
her
they
were
looking
inland
now
there
were
no
lights
visible
nothing
but
dark
chaotic
emptiness
from
somewhere
below
him
he
could
hear
the
wind
in
the
this
way
she
directed
be
they
walked
to
the
very
edge
of
the
palisading
it
was
scarcely
more
than
a
couple
of
feet
high
she
pointed
downwards
can
you
see
she
whispered
by
degrees
his
eyes
faintly
penetrated
the
darkness
it
was
as
though
they
were
looking
down
a
precipice
the
descent
was
perfectly
sheer
for
nearly
a
hundred
feet
at
the
bottom
were
the
pine
trees
come
here
again
in
the
morning
she
whispered
you
will
see
then
i
brought
you
here
to
show
you
the
place
it
was
here
that
the
accident
what
accident
mr
fentolin
s
she
continued
it
was
here
that
he
went
over
he
was
picked
up
with
both
his
legs
broken
they
never
thought
that
he
would
hamel
shivered
a
little
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
saw
more
distinctly
than
ever
the
sheer
fall
the
tops
of
the
bending
trees
below
what
a
horrible
thing
he
exclaimed
it
was
more
horrible
than
you
know
she
continued
dropping
her
voice
a
little
almost
whispering
in
his
ear
i
do
not
know
why
i
tell
you
this
you
a
stranger
but
if
i
do
not
tell
some
one
i
think
that
the
memory
of
it
will
drive
me
mad
it
was
no
accident
at
all
fentolin
was
thrown
over
by
whom
he
asked
she
clung
to
his
arm
for
a
moment
ah
don
t
ask
me
she
begged
no
one
knows
my
uncle
gave
out
as
soon
as
he
was
conscious
that
it
was
an
that
at
any
rate
was
fine
of
him
hamel
declared
she
shivered
he
was
proud
at
least
of
our
family
name
whatever
credit
he
deserves
for
it
he
must
have
it
was
owing
to
that
accident
that
we
became
his
slaves
nothing
but
that
his
absolute
slaves
to
wait
upon
him
if
he
would
hand
and
foot
you
see
he
has
never
been
able
to
marry
his
life
was
of
course
ruined
so
the
burden
came
to
us
we
took
it
up
little
thinking
what
was
in
store
for
us
five
years
ago
we
came
here
to
live
gerald
wanted
to
go
into
the
army
i
wanted
to
travel
with
my
mother
gerald
has
done
all
the
work
secretly
but
he
has
never
been
allowed
to
pass
his
examinations
i
have
never
left
england
except
to
spend
two
years
at
the
strictest
in
paris
to
which
i
was
taken
and
fetched
away
by
one
of
his
creatures
we
live
here
with
the
shadow
of
this
thing
always
with
us
we
are
his
puppets
if
we
hesitate
to
do
his
bidding
he
reminds
us
so
far
we
have
been
his
creatures
body
and
soul
whether
it
will
go
on
i
can
not
say
oh
i
can
not
say
it
is
bad
for
us
but
there
is
mother
too
he
makes
her
life
a
perfect
hell
a
roar
of
wind
came
booming
once
more
across
the
marshes
bending
the
trees
which
grew
so
thickly
beneath
them
and
which
ascended
precipitately
to
the
back
of
the
house
the
french
windows
behind
rattled
she
looked
around
nervously
i
am
afraid
of
him
all
the
time
she
murmured
he
seems
to
overhear
everything
he
or
his
creatures
listen
they
were
silent
for
several
moments
he
whispered
in
her
ear
so
closely
that
through
the
darkness
he
could
see
the
fire
in
her
eyes
you
are
telling
me
half
he
said
tell
me
everything
who
threw
your
uncle
over
the
parapet
she
stood
by
his
side
motionless
and
trembling
it
was
the
passion
of
a
moment
she
said
at
last
speaking
hoarsely
i
can
not
tell
you
listen
listen
there
is
no
one
near
hamel
assured
her
it
is
the
wind
which
shakes
the
windows
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
everything
i
would
like
to
be
your
friend
believe
me
i
have
that
desire
really
there
are
so
many
things
which
i
do
not
understand
that
it
is
dull
here
for
you
of
course
is
natural
but
there
is
something
more
than
that
you
seem
always
to
fear
something
your
uncle
is
a
selfish
man
naturally
although
to
look
at
him
he
seems
to
have
the
disposition
of
an
angel
but
beyond
that
is
there
anything
of
which
you
are
afraid
you
seem
all
the
time
to
live
in
she
suddenly
clutched
his
hand
there
was
nothing
of
affection
in
her
touch
and
yet
he
felt
a
thrill
of
delight
there
are
strange
things
which
happen
here
she
whispered
things
which
neither
gerald
nor
i
understand
yet
they
terrify
us
i
think
that
very
soon
the
end
will
come
neither
of
us
can
stand
it
very
much
longer
we
have
no
friends
somehow
or
other
he
seems
to
manage
to
keep
us
always
i
shall
not
go
away
from
here
hamel
said
firmly
at
present
mind
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
living
this
solitary
life
as
you
do
you
have
not
become
a
little
that
you
have
not
exaggerated
the
fear
of
some
things
to
me
your
uncle
seems
merely
quixotic
and
egregiously
selfish
however
that
may
be
i
am
going
to
she
clutched
once
more
at
his
arm
her
finger
was
upraised
they
listened
together
from
somewhere
behind
them
came
the
clear
low
wailing
of
a
violin
it
is
fentolin
she
whispered
please
come
in
let
us
go
in
at
once
he
only
plays
when
he
is
excited
i
am
afraid
oh
i
am
afraid
that
something
is
going
to
happen
she
was
already
round
the
corner
and
on
her
way
to
the
main
terrace
he
followed
her
closely
chapter
xvi
let
us
follow
the
example
of
all
great
golfers
hamel
said
let
us
for
this
morning
at
any
rate
imagine
that
your
whole
world
is
encompassed
within
these
eighteen
holes
we
have
been
sent
here
in
a
moment
of
good
humour
by
your
tyrant
uncle
the
sun
shines
and
the
wind
is
from
the
west
why
not
that
is
all
very
well
for
you
she
retorted
smiling
but
i
have
topped
my
purely
an
incident
he
assured
her
the
vicissitudes
of
the
game
do
not
enter
into
the
question
i
have
driven
a
ball
far
above
my
usual
form
but
i
am
not
gloating
over
it
i
prefer
to
remember
only
that
i
am
going
to
spend
the
next
two
hours
with
she
played
her
shot
and
they
walked
for
a
little
way
together
she
was
suddenly
silent
do
you
know
she
said
finally
just
a
little
gravely
i
am
not
at
all
used
to
speeches
of
this
then
you
ought
to
be
he
declared
nothing
but
the
lonely
life
you
have
been
living
has
kept
you
from
hearing
them
she
laughed
a
little
at
the
impotence
of
her
rebuff
and
paused
for
a
moment
to
make
her
next
shot
hamel
standing
a
little
on
one
side
watched
her
appraisingly
her
short
grey
tweed
skirt
was
obviously
the
handiwork
of
an
accomplished
tailor
her
grey
stockings
and
suede
shoes
were
immaculate
and
showed
a
care
for
her
appearance
which
pleased
him
her
swing
too
revealed
a
grace
the
grace
of
long
arms
and
a
supple
body
at
which
previously
he
had
only
guessed
the
sunshine
seemed
to
have
brought
out
a
copper
tinge
from
her
abundant
brown
hair
do
you
know
he
remarked
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
like
your
uncle
great
idea
of
his
sending
us
off
here
directly
after
her
face
darkened
for
a
moment
and
he
realised
his
error
the
same
thought
indeed
had
been
in
both
their
minds
fentolin
s
courteous
suggestion
had
been
offered
to
them
almost
in
the
shape
of
a
command
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
escape
from
the
reflection
that
he
had
desired
to
rid
himself
of
their
presence
for
the
morning
of
course
he
went
on
i
knew
that
these
links
were
good
quite
famous
aren
t
they
i
have
played
on
so
few
others
she
told
him
i
learned
my
golf
here
with
king
the
he
took
off
his
cap
and
handed
it
to
his
caddy
he
himself
was
beginning
already
to
look
younger
the
long
blue
waves
came
rippling
up
the
creeks
the
salt
wind
soft
with
sunshine
blew
in
their
faces
the
marshes
on
the
landward
side
were
mauve
with
lavender
blossom
in
the
distance
the
cottages
nestled
deep
among
a
background
of
green
trees
and
rising
fields
this
indeed
is
a
land
of
peace
he
declared
if
i
hadn
t
to
give
you
quite
so
many
strokes
i
should
be
really
enjoying
you
don
t
play
like
a
man
who
has
been
living
abroad
for
a
great
many
years
she
remarked
tell
me
about
some
of
the
places
you
have
visited
don
t
let
us
talk
seriously
he
begged
i
ll
tell
you
of
them
but
let
it
be
later
on
this
morning
i
feel
that
the
spring
air
is
getting
into
my
head
i
have
an
absurd
desire
to
talk
so
far
she
admitted
you
haven
t
been
altogether
if
you
are
alluding
he
replied
to
the
personal
remarks
i
was
emboldened
to
make
on
my
way
here
i
can
only
say
that
they
were
excused
by
their
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
have
known
me
long
enough
to
tell
me
what
colours
suit
me
she
demurred
then
what
will
you
say
he
enquired
if
i
admire
the
angle
of
that
quill
in
your
hat
don
t
do
it
she
laughed
if
you
continue
like
this
i
may
have
to
go
you
have
sent
the
car
away
he
reminded
her
cheerfully
you
would
simply
have
to
sit
upon
the
balcony
and
reflect
upon
your
wasted
i
decline
to
talk
upon
the
putting
green
she
said
it
puts
me
off
if
you
will
stand
perfectly
quiet
and
say
nothing
i
will
play
the
they
moved
off
presently
to
the
next
teeing
ground
i
don
t
believe
this
nonsense
is
good
for
our
golf
she
said
it
is
immensely
good
for
us
as
human
beings
he
protested
they
had
played
the
ninth
hole
and
turned
for
home
on
their
right
now
was
a
shimmering
stretch
of
wet
sand
and
a
thin
line
of
sea
in
the
distance
the
tide
receding
had
left
little
islands
of
virgin
sand
grass
tufted
the
home
of
countless
a
fishing
boat
was
racing
for
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
tidal
way
i
am
beginning
to
understand
what
there
is
about
this
coast
which
fascinated
my
father
so
he
remarked
are
you
she
answered
gravely
years
ago
i
used
to
love
it
but
not
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
but
the
gloom
had
settled
upon
her
face
once
more
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
like
she
went
on
as
they
walked
side
by
side
after
their
balls
to
live
day
and
night
in
fear
with
no
one
to
talk
to
no
one
that
is
to
say
who
is
not
under
the
same
shadow
even
the
voices
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
and
the
screaming
of
the
birds
seem
to
bring
always
an
evil
message
there
is
nothing
kindly
or
hopeful
even
in
the
sunshine
at
night
when
the
tide
comes
thundering
in
as
it
does
so
often
at
this
time
of
the
year
one
is
afraid
there
is
so
much
to
make
one
afraid
she
had
turned
pale
again
notwithstanding
the
sunshine
and
the
freshening
wind
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
upon
her
arm
she
suffered
his
touch
without
appearing
to
notice
it
ah
you
mustn
t
talk
like
that
he
pleaded
do
you
know
what
you
make
me
feel
like
she
came
back
from
the
world
of
her
own
unhappy
imaginings
really
i
forgot
myself
she
declared
with
a
little
smile
never
mind
it
does
one
good
sometimes
one
up
are
you
henceforth
then
golf
all
the
rigour
of
the
game
he
fell
in
with
her
mood
and
their
conversation
touched
only
upon
the
game
on
the
last
green
he
suffered
defeat
and
acknowledged
it
with
a
little
grimace
if
i
might
say
so
miss
fentolin
he
protested
you
are
a
little
too
good
for
your
handicap
i
used
to
play
a
very
reasonable
scratch
myself
but
i
can
t
give
you
the
she
smiled
doubtless
your
long
absence
abroad
she
began
slowly
has
affected
your
i
was
round
in
he
grumbled
you
must
have
travelled
in
many
countries
she
continued
where
golf
was
an
naturally
he
admitted
let
us
stay
and
have
lunch
and
try
she
shook
her
head
with
a
little
sigh
of
regret
you
see
the
car
is
waiting
she
pointed
out
we
are
expected
home
i
shan
t
be
a
minute
putting
my
clubs
they
sped
swiftly
along
the
level
road
towards
david
s
hall
far
in
the
distance
they
saw
it
built
upon
that
strange
hill
with
the
sunlight
flashing
in
its
windows
he
looked
at
it
long
and
curiously
i
think
he
said
that
yours
is
the
most
extraordinarily
situated
house
i
have
ever
seen
fancy
a
gigantic
mound
like
that
in
the
midst
of
an
absolutely
flat
she
nodded
there
is
no
other
house
quite
like
it
in
england
she
said
i
suppose
it
is
really
a
wonderful
place
have
you
looked
at
the
pictures
not
carefully
he
told
her
you
must
before
you
leave
she
insisted
mr
fentolin
is
a
great
judge
and
so
was
his
their
road
curved
a
little
to
the
sea
and
at
its
last
bend
they
were
close
to
the
pebbly
ridge
on
which
the
tower
was
built
he
touched
the
electric
bell
and
stopped
the
car
do
let
us
walk
along
and
have
a
look
at
my
queer
possession
once
more
he
begged
luncheon
you
told
me
is
not
till
one
and
it
is
a
quarter
to
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
assented
they
left
the
car
and
walked
along
the
little
track
bordered
with
white
posts
which
led
on
to
the
ridge
to
their
right
was
the
village
separated
from
them
only
by
one
level
stretch
of
meadowland
in
the
background
the
hall
they
turned
along
the
raised
dike
just
inside
the
pebbly
beach
and
she
showed
her
companion
the
narrow
waterway
up
to
the
village
at
its
entrance
was
a
tall
iron
upright
with
a
ladder
attached
and
a
great
lamp
at
the
top
that
is
to
show
them
the
way
in
at
night
isn
t
it
he
asked
she
nodded
yes
she
told
him
mr
fentolin
had
it
placed
there
and
yet
she
went
on
curiously
enough
since
it
was
erected
there
have
been
more
wrecks
than
it
doesn
t
seem
a
dangerous
beach
he
remarked
she
pointed
to
a
spot
about
fifty
yards
from
the
tower
it
was
the
spot
to
which
the
woman
whom
he
had
met
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
had
pointed
you
can
t
see
them
she
said
they
are
always
out
of
sight
even
when
the
tide
is
at
the
lowest
but
there
are
some
hideous
sunken
rocks
there
the
daggers
they
call
them
one
or
two
fishing
boats
have
been
lost
on
them
trying
to
make
the
village
when
fentolin
put
up
the
lamp
every
one
thought
that
it
would
be
quite
safe
to
try
and
get
in
at
night
this
winter
though
there
have
been
three
wrecks
which
no
one
could
understand
it
must
be
something
in
the
currents
or
a
sort
of
optical
illusion
because
in
the
last
shipwreck
one
man
was
saved
and
he
swore
that
at
the
time
they
struck
the
rock
they
were
headed
straight
for
the
they
had
reached
the
tower
now
hamel
became
a
little
absorbed
they
walked
around
it
and
he
tried
the
front
door
he
found
as
he
had
expected
that
it
opened
readily
he
looked
around
him
for
several
moments
your
uncle
has
been
here
this
morning
he
remarked
quietly
very
that
outhouse
he
continued
must
be
quite
a
large
place
have
you
any
idea
what
it
is
he
works
upon
there
none
she
answered
he
looked
around
him
once
more
mr
fentolin
has
been
preparing
for
my
coming
he
observed
i
see
that
he
has
moved
a
few
of
his
personal
she
made
no
reply
only
she
shivered
a
little
as
she
stepped
back
into
the
sunshine
i
don
t
believe
you
like
my
little
domicile
he
remarked
as
they
started
off
homeward
i
don
t
she
admitted
curtly
in
the
train
he
reminded
her
you
seemed
rather
to
discourage
my
coming
here
yet
last
night
after
dinner
i
was
wrong
she
interrupted
i
should
have
said
nothing
and
yet
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
don
t
suppose
it
will
make
any
make
any
difference
to
what
i
can
not
tell
you
she
confessed
only
i
have
a
strange
antipathy
to
the
place
i
don
t
like
it
my
uncle
sometimes
shuts
himself
up
here
for
quite
a
long
time
we
have
an
idea
gerald
and
i
that
things
happen
here
sometimes
which
no
one
knows
of
when
he
comes
back
he
is
moody
and
or
else
half
mad
with
excitement
he
isn
t
always
the
amiable
creature
whom
you
have
met
he
has
the
face
of
an
angel
but
there
are
times
well
don
t
let
s
talk
about
him
hamel
begged
as
her
voice
faltered
now
that
i
am
going
to
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
for
a
few
days
you
must
please
remember
that
it
is
partly
your
responsibility
you
are
not
going
to
shut
yourself
up
are
you
you
ll
come
and
play
golf
again
if
he
will
let
me
she
promised
i
think
he
will
let
you
right
enough
hamel
observed
between
you
and
me
i
rather
think
he
hates
having
me
down
at
the
tower
at
all
he
will
encourage
anything
that
takes
me
away
even
as
far
as
the
golf
they
were
approaching
the
hall
now
she
was
looking
once
more
as
she
had
looked
last
night
she
had
lost
her
colour
her
walk
was
no
longer
buoyant
she
had
the
air
of
a
prisoner
who
after
a
brief
spell
of
liberty
enters
once
more
the
place
of
his
confinement
gerald
came
out
to
meet
them
as
they
climbed
the
stone
steps
which
led
on
to
the
terrace
he
glanced
behind
as
he
greeted
them
and
then
almost
stealthily
took
a
telegram
from
his
pocket
this
came
for
you
he
remarked
handing
it
to
hamel
i
met
the
boy
bringing
it
out
of
the
hamel
tore
it
open
with
a
word
of
thanks
gerald
stood
in
front
of
him
as
he
read
if
you
wouldn
t
mind
putting
it
away
at
once
he
asked
a
little
uncomfortably
you
see
the
telegraph
office
is
in
the
place
and
my
uncle
has
a
queer
rule
that
every
telegram
is
brought
to
him
before
it
is
hamel
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
he
was
looking
at
the
few
words
scrawled
across
the
pink
sheet
with
a
heavy
black
pencil
make
every
enquiry
in
your
neighbourhood
for
an
american
john
dunster
entrusted
with
message
of
great
importance
addressed
to
von
dusenberg
the
hague
is
believed
to
have
been
in
railway
accident
near
wymondham
and
to
have
been
taken
from
inn
by
young
man
in
suggest
that
he
is
being
improperly
hamel
crumpled
up
the
telegram
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
he
asked
as
they
ascended
the
steps
what
did
you
say
the
name
of
this
poor
fellow
was
who
is
lying
ill
gerald
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
answered
as
though
a
species
of
recklessness
had
seized
him
he
called
himself
john
chapter
xvii
fentolin
having
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
his
niece
and
his
somewhat
embarrassing
guest
for
at
least
two
hours
was
seated
in
his
study
planning
out
a
somewhat
strenuous
morning
when
his
privacy
was
invaded
by
doctor
sarson
our
guest
the
latter
announced
in
his
usual
cold
and
measured
tones
has
sent
me
to
request
that
you
will
favour
him
with
an
fentolin
laid
his
pen
deliberately
down
so
soon
he
murmured
very
well
sarson
i
am
at
his
service
say
that
i
will
come
at
fentolin
lost
no
time
in
paying
this
suggested
visit
john
dunster
shaved
and
clothed
was
seated
in
an
drawn
up
to
the
window
of
his
room
smoking
what
he
was
forced
to
confess
was
a
very
excellent
cigar
he
turned
his
head
as
the
door
opened
and
fentolin
waved
his
hand
pleasantly
really
he
declared
this
is
most
agreeable
i
had
an
idea
dunster
that
i
should
find
you
a
reasonable
person
men
of
your
eminence
in
their
profession
usually
dunster
looked
at
the
speaker
curiously
and
what
might
my
profession
be
fentolin
he
asked
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
about
it
is
true
fentolin
admitted
i
do
know
a
great
dunster
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
well
he
said
i
have
been
the
hearer
of
several
important
communications
from
my
side
of
the
atlantic
to
england
and
to
the
continent
and
i
have
always
known
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
risk
in
the
business
once
i
had
an
exceedingly
narrow
shave
he
continued
reminiscently
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
been
dead
up
against
it
and
i
don
t
mind
confessing
that
you
ve
fairly
got
me
puzzled
who
the
mischief
are
you
fentolin
and
what
are
you
interfering
about
fentolin
smiled
queerly
i
am
what
you
see
he
replied
i
am
one
of
those
unfortunate
human
beings
who
by
reason
of
their
physical
misfortunes
are
cut
off
from
the
world
of
actual
life
i
have
been
compelled
to
seek
distraction
in
strange
quarters
i
have
wealth
great
wealth
i
suppose
i
should
say
an
inordinate
curiosity
a
talent
for
intrigue
as
to
the
direction
in
which
i
carry
on
my
intrigues
or
even
as
to
the
direct
interests
which
i
study
that
is
a
matter
dunster
upon
which
i
shall
not
gratify
your
curiosity
nor
anybody
else
s
but
you
see
i
am
admitting
freely
that
it
does
interest
me
to
interfere
in
great
but
how
on
earth
did
you
get
to
know
about
me
dunster
asked
and
my
errand
you
couldn
t
possibly
have
got
me
here
in
an
ordinary
way
it
was
an
entire
there
you
speak
with
some
show
of
reason
i
have
a
nephew
whom
you
have
met
who
is
devoted
to
mr
gerald
fentolin
dunster
remarked
drily
precisely
fentolin
declared
well
i
admit
frankly
the
truth
of
what
you
say
your
shall
we
say
capture
was
by
way
of
being
a
gigantic
fluke
my
nephew
s
instructions
simply
were
to
travel
down
by
the
train
to
harwich
with
you
to
endeavour
to
make
your
acquaintance
to
follow
you
on
to
your
destination
and
if
any
chance
to
do
so
occurred
to
relieve
you
of
your
that
however
i
never
ventured
to
expect
what
really
happened
was
as
you
have
yourself
suggested
almost
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
my
nephew
showed
himself
to
be
possessed
of
gifts
which
were
a
revelation
to
me
he
not
only
succeeded
in
travelling
with
you
by
the
special
train
but
after
its
wreck
he
was
clever
enough
to
bring
you
here
instead
of
delivering
you
over
to
the
mercies
of
a
village
doctor
i
really
can
not
find
words
to
express
my
appreciation
of
my
nephew
s
i
could
dunster
muttered
very
easily
fentolin
sighed
gently
perhaps
our
points
of
view
might
we
have
spent
a
very
agreeable
few
minutes
in
explanations
dunster
continued
would
it
be
asking
too
much
if
i
now
suggest
that
we
remove
the
buttons
from
our
foils
why
not
fentolin
assented
smoothly
your
first
question
to
yourself
under
these
circumstances
would
naturally
be
what
does
fentolin
want
with
me
i
will
answer
that
question
for
you
all
that
i
ask
it
is
really
very
little
is
the
word
agreed
dunster
held
his
cigar
a
little
way
off
and
looked
steadfastly
at
his
host
for
a
moment
so
you
have
interpreted
my
cipher
fentolin
spread
out
the
palms
of
his
hands
in
a
delicate
gesture
my
dear
dunster
he
said
one
of
the
simplest
i
think
that
was
ever
strung
together
i
am
somewhat
of
an
authority
upon
i
gather
dunster
went
on
although
his
cigar
was
burning
itself
out
that
you
have
broken
the
seal
of
my
dispatches
fentolin
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
had
heard
a
discord
nothing
so
clumsy
as
that
i
hope
he
murmured
gently
i
will
not
insult
a
person
of
your
experience
and
intelligence
by
enumerating
the
various
ways
in
which
the
seal
of
a
dispatch
may
be
liquefied
it
is
quite
true
that
i
have
read
with
much
pleasure
the
letter
which
you
are
carrying
from
a
certain
group
of
very
distinguished
men
to
a
certain
person
now
in
the
hague
the
letter
however
is
replaced
in
its
envelope
the
seal
is
still
there
you
need
have
no
fears
whatever
concerning
it
all
that
i
require
is
that
one
word
from
and
if
i
give
you
that
one
word
dunster
asked
if
you
give
it
me
as
i
think
you
will
fentolin
replied
suavely
i
shall
then
telegraph
to
my
agent
or
rather
i
should
say
to
a
dear
friend
of
mine
who
lives
at
the
hague
and
that
single
word
will
be
cabled
by
him
from
the
hague
to
new
and
in
that
case
dunster
enquired
what
would
become
of
me
you
would
give
us
the
great
pleasure
of
your
company
here
for
a
very
brief
visit
fentolin
answered
we
should
i
can
assure
you
do
our
very
best
to
entertain
and
the
dispatch
which
i
am
carrying
to
the
hague
would
remain
here
with
dunster
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
without
being
a
man
of
great
parts
he
was
a
shrewd
person
possessed
of
an
abundant
stock
of
common
sense
he
applied
himself
for
a
few
moments
to
a
consideration
of
this
affair
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
come
fentolin
he
said
at
last
you
must
really
forgive
me
but
i
can
t
see
what
you
re
driving
at
you
are
an
englishman
are
you
not
i
am
an
englishman
fentolin
confessed
or
rather
he
added
with
ghastly
humour
i
am
half
an
you
are
i
am
sure
dunster
continued
a
person
of
intelligence
a
person
a
person
of
perceptions
surely
you
can
see
and
appreciate
the
danger
with
which
your
country
is
threatened
with
regard
to
political
affairs
fentolin
admitted
i
consider
myself
unusually
well
posted
in
fact
the
study
of
the
diplomatic
methods
of
the
various
great
powers
is
rather
a
hobby
of
yet
dunster
persisted
you
do
not
wish
this
letter
delivered
to
that
little
conference
in
the
hague
which
you
must
be
aware
is
now
sitting
practically
to
determine
the
fate
of
your
nation
i
do
not
wish
fentolin
replied
i
do
not
intend
that
that
letter
shall
be
delivered
why
do
you
worry
about
my
point
of
view
i
may
have
a
dozen
reasons
i
may
believe
that
it
will
be
good
for
my
country
to
suffer
a
little
or
you
may
dunster
suggested
glancing
keenly
at
his
host
be
the
paid
agent
of
some
foreign
fentolin
shook
his
head
my
means
he
pointed
out
should
place
me
above
such
suspicion
my
income
i
really
believe
is
rather
more
than
fifty
thousand
pounds
a
year
i
should
not
enter
into
these
adventures
which
naturally
are
not
entirely
dissociated
from
a
certain
amount
of
risk
for
the
purposes
of
financial
dunster
was
still
mystified
granted
that
you
do
so
from
pure
love
of
adventure
he
declared
i
still
can
not
see
why
you
should
range
yourself
on
the
side
of
your
country
s
enemies
in
time
fentolin
observed
even
that
may
become
clear
to
you
at
present
well
just
that
word
if
you
please
dunster
shook
his
head
no
he
decided
i
do
not
think
so
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
that
fentolin
gave
no
sign
of
annoyance
or
even
disappointment
he
simply
sighed
his
eyes
were
full
of
a
gentle
sympathy
his
face
indicated
a
certain
amount
of
concern
you
distress
me
he
declared
perhaps
it
is
my
fault
i
have
not
made
myself
sufficiently
clear
the
knowledge
of
that
word
is
a
necessity
to
me
without
it
i
can
not
complete
my
plans
without
it
i
very
much
fear
dear
dunster
that
your
sojourn
among
us
may
be
longer
than
you
have
any
idea
dunster
laughed
a
little
derisively
we
ve
passed
those
days
he
remarked
i
ve
done
my
best
to
enter
into
the
humour
of
this
situation
but
there
are
limits
you
can
t
keep
prisoners
in
english
country
houses
nowadays
there
are
a
dozen
ways
of
communicating
with
the
outside
world
and
when
that
s
once
done
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
of
squire
fentolin
of
david
s
hall
might
be
a
little
fentolin
smiled
very
slightly
still
very
blandly
alas
my
stalwart
friend
i
fear
that
you
are
by
nature
an
optimist
i
am
not
a
betting
man
but
i
am
prepared
to
bet
you
a
hundred
pounds
to
one
that
you
have
made
your
last
communication
with
the
outside
world
until
i
say
the
dunster
was
obviously
plentifully
supplied
with
either
courage
or
bravado
for
he
only
laughed
then
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
at
once
fentolin
how
soon
that
word
is
to
be
spoken
or
you
may
lose
your
money
he
remarked
fentolin
sat
very
quietly
in
his
chair
you
mean
then
he
asked
that
you
do
not
intend
to
humour
me
in
this
little
matter
i
do
not
intend
dunster
assured
him
to
part
with
that
word
to
you
or
to
any
one
else
in
the
the
world
when
my
message
has
been
presented
to
the
person
to
whom
it
has
been
addressed
when
my
trust
is
discharged
then
and
then
only
shall
i
send
that
cablegram
that
moment
can
only
arrive
at
the
end
of
my
fentolin
leaned
now
a
little
forward
in
his
chair
his
face
was
still
smooth
and
expressionless
but
there
was
a
queer
sort
of
meaning
in
his
words
the
end
of
your
journey
he
said
grimly
may
be
nearer
than
you
if
i
am
not
heard
of
in
the
hague
at
the
latest
dunster
pointed
out
remember
that
before
many
more
hours
have
passed
i
shall
be
searched
for
even
to
the
far
corners
of
the
let
me
assure
you
fentolin
promised
serenely
that
though
your
friends
search
for
you
up
in
the
skies
or
down
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
will
not
find
you
my
are
not
as
other
people
dunster
beat
lightly
with
his
square
blunt
forefinger
upon
the
table
which
stood
by
his
side
that
s
not
the
sort
of
talk
i
understand
he
declared
curtly
let
us
understand
one
another
if
we
can
what
is
to
happen
to
me
if
i
refuse
to
give
you
that
word
fentolin
held
his
hand
in
front
of
his
eyes
as
though
to
shut
out
some
unwelcome
vision
dear
me
he
exclaimed
how
unpleasant
why
should
you
force
me
to
disclose
my
plans
be
content
dear
dunster
with
the
knowledge
of
this
one
fact
we
can
not
part
with
you
i
have
thought
it
over
from
every
point
of
view
and
i
have
come
to
that
conclusion
always
presuming
he
went
on
that
the
knowledge
of
that
little
word
of
which
we
have
spoken
remains
in
its
secret
chamber
of
your
dunster
smoked
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
i
am
very
comfortable
here
he
remarked
you
delight
me
fentolin
murmured
your
cook
dunster
continued
has
won
my
heartfelt
appreciation
your
cigars
and
wines
are
fit
for
any
nobleman
perhaps
after
all
this
little
rest
is
good
for
fentolin
listened
attentively
do
not
forget
he
said
that
there
is
always
a
limit
fixed
whether
it
be
one
day
two
days
or
three
a
limit
to
your
complacence
i
presume
fentolin
assented
obviously
then
dunster
concluded
you
wish
those
who
sent
me
to
believe
that
my
message
has
been
delivered
yet
there
i
must
confess
that
you
puzzle
me
what
i
can
not
see
is
to
put
it
bluntly
where
you
come
in
any
one
of
the
countries
represented
at
this
little
conference
would
only
be
the
gainers
by
the
miscarriage
of
my
message
which
is
without
doubt
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
of
a
distasteful
nature
your
own
country
alone
could
be
the
sufferer
now
what
interest
in
the
world
then
is
there
left
what
interest
in
the
world
can
you
possibly
represent
which
can
be
the
gainer
by
your
present
action
fentolin
s
eyes
grew
suddenly
a
little
brighter
there
was
a
light
upon
his
face
strange
to
witness
the
power
which
is
to
be
the
gainer
he
said
quietly
is
the
power
encompassed
by
these
he
touched
his
chest
his
long
slim
fingers
were
folded
upon
it
when
i
meet
a
man
whom
i
like
he
continued
softly
i
take
him
into
my
confidence
picture
me
if
you
will
as
a
kind
of
puck
haven
t
you
heard
that
with
the
decay
of
the
body
comes
sometimes
a
malignant
growth
in
the
brain
a
desire
for
evil
to
fall
upon
the
world
a
desire
to
escape
from
the
loneliness
of
suffering
the
isolation
of
black
misery
john
dunster
let
his
cigar
burn
out
he
looked
steadfastly
at
this
strange
little
figure
whose
chair
had
imperceptibly
moved
a
little
nearer
to
his
you
know
what
the
withholding
of
this
message
you
carry
may
mean
fentolin
proceeded
you
come
here
bearing
to
europe
the
word
of
a
great
people
a
people
whose
voice
is
powerful
enough
even
to
still
the
gathering
furies
i
have
read
your
ciphered
message
it
is
what
i
feared
it
is
my
will
mine
miles
fentolin
s
that
that
message
be
not
i
wonder
dunster
muttered
under
his
breath
whether
you
are
in
in
your
heart
fentolin
told
him
you
know
that
i
am
i
can
see
the
truth
in
your
face
now
for
the
first
time
you
begin
to
to
a
certain
extent
dunster
admitted
where
i
am
still
in
the
dark
however
is
why
you
should
expect
that
i
should
become
your
confederate
it
is
true
that
by
holding
me
up
and
obstructing
my
message
you
may
bring
about
the
evil
you
seek
but
unless
that
word
is
cabled
back
to
new
york
and
my
senders
believe
that
my
message
has
been
delivered
there
can
be
no
certainty
what
has
been
trusted
to
me
as
the
safest
means
of
transmission
might
in
an
emergency
be
committed
to
a
excellent
reasoning
fentolin
agreed
for
the
very
reasons
you
name
that
word
will
be
dunster
s
face
was
momentarily
troubled
there
was
something
in
the
still
cold
emphasis
of
this
man
s
voice
which
made
him
shiver
do
you
think
fentolin
went
on
that
i
spend
a
great
fortune
buying
the
secrets
of
the
world
that
i
live
from
day
to
day
with
the
risk
of
ignominious
detection
always
hovering
about
me
do
you
think
that
i
do
this
and
am
yet
unprepared
to
run
the
final
risks
of
life
and
death
have
you
ever
talked
with
a
murderer
dunster
has
curiosity
ever
taken
you
within
the
walls
of
sing
sing
have
you
sat
within
the
cell
of
a
doomed
man
and
felt
the
thrill
of
his
touch
of
his
close
presence
well
i
will
not
ask
you
those
questions
i
will
simply
tell
you
that
you
are
talking
to
one
dunster
had
forgotten
his
extinct
cigar
he
found
it
difficult
to
remove
his
eyes
from
fentolin
s
face
he
was
half
fascinated
half
stirred
with
a
vague
mysterious
fear
underneath
these
wild
words
ran
always
that
hard
note
of
truth
you
seem
to
be
in
earnest
he
muttered
i
am
fentolin
assured
him
quietly
i
have
more
than
once
been
instrumental
in
bringing
about
the
death
of
those
who
have
crossed
my
purposes
i
plead
guilty
to
the
weakness
of
nero
suffering
and
death
are
things
of
joy
to
me
there
i
am
not
sure
dunster
said
slowly
that
i
ought
not
to
wring
your
fentolin
smiled
his
chair
receded
an
inch
or
two
there
was
never
a
time
when
his
expression
had
seemed
more
seraphic
there
is
no
emergency
of
that
sort
he
remarked
for
which
i
am
not
his
little
revolver
gleamed
for
a
minute
beneath
his
cuff
he
backed
his
chair
slowly
and
with
wonderful
skill
towards
the
door
we
will
fix
the
period
of
your
probation
dunster
at
say
hours
he
decided
please
make
yourself
until
then
entirely
at
home
my
cook
my
cellar
my
cigar
cabinets
are
at
your
disposal
if
some
happy
impulse
he
concluded
should
show
you
the
only
reasonable
course
by
dinnertime
it
would
give
me
the
utmost
pleasure
to
have
you
join
us
at
that
meal
i
can
promise
you
a
cheque
beneath
your
plate
which
even
you
might
think
worth
considering
wine
in
your
glass
which
kings
might
sigh
for
cigars
by
your
side
which
even
your
pierpont
morgan
could
not
buy
au
revoir
the
door
opened
and
closed
dunster
sat
staring
into
the
open
space
like
a
man
still
a
little
dazed
chapter
xviii
the
beautiful
but
somewhat
austere
front
of
david
s
hall
seemed
in
a
sense
transformed
as
hamel
and
his
companion
climbed
the
worn
grey
steps
which
led
on
to
the
broad
sweep
of
terrace
evidently
visitors
had
recently
arrived
a
dark
rather
woman
with
pleasant
round
face
and
a
ceaseless
flow
of
conversation
was
chattering
away
to
fentolin
by
her
side
stood
another
woman
who
was
a
stranger
to
hamel
thin
still
elegant
with
tired
worn
face
and
the
shadow
of
something
in
her
eyes
which
reminded
him
at
once
of
esther
she
wore
a
large
picture
hat
and
carried
a
little
pomeranian
dog
under
her
arm
in
the
background
an
man
with
grey
and
spectacles
was
beaming
upon
everybody
fentolin
waved
his
hand
and
beckoned
to
hamel
and
esther
as
they
somewhat
hesitatingly
approached
this
is
one
of
my
fortunate
mornings
you
see
esther
he
exclaimed
smiling
lady
saxthorpe
has
brought
her
husband
over
to
lunch
lady
saxthorpe
he
added
turning
to
the
woman
at
his
side
let
me
present
to
you
the
son
of
one
of
the
first
men
to
realise
the
elusive
beauty
of
our
coast
this
is
hamel
son
of
peter
hamel
the
countess
of
lady
saxthorpe
who
had
been
engaged
in
greeting
esther
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
at
hamel
i
know
your
father
s
work
quite
well
she
declared
and
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
have
made
a
pilgrimage
here
they
tell
me
that
he
painted
nineteen
pictures
pictures
of
importance
that
is
to
say
within
this
little
area
of
ten
miles
do
you
paint
hamel
not
at
all
hamel
answered
our
friend
hamel
fentolin
intervened
woos
other
and
sterner
muses
he
fights
nature
in
distant
countries
spans
her
gorges
with
iron
bridges
stems
the
fury
of
her
rivers
and
carries
to
the
boundary
of
the
world
that
little
twin
line
of
metal
which
brings
men
like
ants
to
the
of
the
universe
my
dear
florence
he
added
suddenly
turning
to
the
woman
at
his
other
side
for
the
moment
i
had
forgotten
you
have
not
met
our
guest
yet
hamel
this
is
my
seymour
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
unnaturally
thin
and
white
covered
with
jewels
again
he
saw
something
in
her
eyes
which
stirred
him
vaguely
it
is
so
nice
that
you
are
able
to
spend
a
few
days
with
us
hamel
she
said
quietly
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
been
too
indisposed
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
fentolin
continued
you
must
know
my
young
friend
here
too
hamel
lord
the
latter
shook
hands
heartily
with
the
young
man
i
knew
your
father
quite
well
he
announced
queer
thing
he
used
to
hang
out
for
months
at
a
time
at
that
little
shanty
on
the
beach
there
hardest
work
in
the
world
to
get
him
away
he
came
over
to
dine
with
us
once
or
twice
but
we
saw
scarcely
anything
of
him
i
hope
his
son
will
not
prove
so
you
are
very
kind
hamel
murmured
mr
hamel
came
into
these
parts
to
claim
his
father
s
property
fentolin
said
however
i
have
persuaded
him
to
spend
a
day
or
two
up
here
before
he
transforms
himself
into
a
misanthrope
what
of
his
golf
esther
eh
mr
hamel
plays
very
well
indeed
the
girl
replied
your
niece
was
too
good
for
me
hamel
confessed
fentolin
smiled
the
politeness
of
this
younger
generation
he
remarked
keeps
the
truth
sometimes
hidden
from
us
i
perceive
that
i
shall
not
be
told
who
won
lady
saxthorpe
you
are
fortunate
indeed
in
the
morning
you
have
chosen
for
your
visit
there
is
no
sun
in
the
world
like
an
april
sun
and
no
corner
of
the
earth
where
it
shines
with
such
effect
as
here
look
steadily
to
the
eastward
of
that
second
dike
and
you
will
see
the
pink
light
upon
the
sands
which
baffled
every
one
until
our
friend
hamel
came
and
caught
it
on
his
i
do
see
it
lady
saxthorpe
murmured
what
eyes
you
have
fentolin
what
perception
for
colour
dear
lady
fentolin
said
i
am
one
of
those
who
benefit
by
the
law
of
compensations
on
a
morning
like
this
i
can
spend
hours
merely
feasting
my
eyes
upon
this
prospect
and
i
can
find
if
not
happiness
the
next
best
thing
the
world
is
full
of
beautiful
places
but
the
strange
part
of
it
is
that
beauty
has
countless
phases
and
each
phase
differs
in
some
subtle
and
unexplainable
manner
from
all
others
look
with
me
fixedly
dear
lady
saxthorpe
look
indeed
with
more
than
your
eyes
look
at
that
flush
of
wild
lavender
where
it
fades
into
the
sands
on
one
side
and
strikes
the
emerald
green
of
that
wet
seamoss
on
the
other
look
at
the
liquid
blue
of
that
tongue
of
sea
which
creeps
along
its
bed
through
the
yellow
sands
through
the
dark
meadowland
which
creeps
and
oozes
and
widens
till
in
an
hour
s
time
it
will
have
become
a
river
look
at
my
sand
islands
virgin
from
the
foot
of
man
the
home
of
the
islands
of
a
day
there
may
be
other
and
more
beautiful
places
there
is
none
quite
like
i
pity
you
no
longer
lady
saxthorpe
asserted
fervently
the
eyes
of
the
artist
are
a
finer
possession
than
the
limbs
of
the
the
butler
announced
luncheon
and
they
all
trooped
in
hamel
found
himself
next
to
lady
saxthorpe
dear
fentolin
has
been
so
kind
she
confided
to
him
as
they
took
their
places
i
came
in
fear
and
trembling
to
ask
for
a
very
small
cheque
for
my
dear
brother
s
diocese
my
brother
is
a
colonial
bishop
you
know
can
you
imagine
what
fentolin
has
given
me
hamel
wondered
politely
lady
saxthorpe
continued
with
an
air
of
triumph
a
thousand
pounds
just
fancy
that
a
thousand
pounds
and
some
people
say
he
is
so
difficult
she
went
on
dropping
her
voice
mrs
hungerford
came
all
the
way
over
from
norwich
to
beg
for
the
infirmary
there
and
he
gave
her
what
was
his
excuse
hamel
asked
i
think
he
told
her
that
it
was
against
his
principles
to
give
to
hospitals
lady
saxthorpe
replied
he
thinks
that
they
should
be
supported
out
of
the
some
people
have
queer
ideas
of
charity
hamel
remarked
now
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
had
been
fentolin
i
would
have
given
the
thousand
pounds
willingly
to
a
hospital
but
not
a
penny
to
a
fentolin
looked
suddenly
down
the
table
he
was
some
distance
away
but
his
hearing
was
wonderful
ah
my
dear
hamel
he
said
believe
me
missions
are
very
wonderful
things
it
is
only
from
a
very
careful
study
of
their
results
that
i
have
brought
myself
to
be
a
considerable
supporter
of
those
where
i
have
some
personal
knowledge
of
the
organisation
hospitals
on
the
other
hand
provide
for
the
poor
what
they
ought
to
be
able
to
provide
for
themselves
the
one
thing
to
avoid
in
the
giving
away
of
money
is
pauperisation
what
do
you
think
florence
his
who
was
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
looked
across
at
him
with
a
bright
but
stereotyped
smile
i
agree
with
you
of
course
miles
i
always
agree
with
you
fentolin
has
the
knack
of
being
right
about
most
things
she
continued
turning
to
lord
saxthorpe
his
judgment
is
really
wish
we
could
get
him
to
come
and
sit
on
the
bench
sometimes
then
lord
saxthorpe
remarked
heartily
our
neighbours
in
this
part
of
the
world
are
not
overburdened
with
brains
he
went
on
that
reminds
me
you
haven
t
got
such
a
thing
as
a
mysterious
invalid
in
the
house
have
you
there
was
a
moment
s
rather
curious
silence
fentolin
was
sitting
like
a
carved
figure
with
a
glass
of
wine
half
raised
to
his
lips
gerald
had
broken
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
was
staring
at
lord
saxthorpe
esther
was
sitting
perfectly
still
her
face
grave
and
calm
her
eyes
alone
full
of
fear
lord
saxthorpe
was
not
an
observant
man
and
he
continued
quite
unconscious
of
the
sensation
which
his
question
had
aroused
sounds
a
silly
thing
to
ask
you
doesn
t
it
they
re
all
full
of
it
at
wells
though
i
sat
on
the
bench
this
morning
and
went
into
the
for
a
moment
first
seems
they
ve
got
a
long
dispatch
from
scotland
yard
about
a
missing
man
who
is
supposed
to
be
in
this
part
of
the
world
he
came
down
in
a
special
train
on
tuesday
night
the
night
of
the
great
flood
and
his
train
was
wrecked
at
wymondham
after
that
he
was
taken
on
by
some
one
in
a
colonel
renshaw
wanted
me
to
allude
to
the
matter
from
the
bench
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
an
affair
entirely
for
the
as
though
suddenly
realising
the
unexpected
interest
which
his
words
had
caused
lord
saxthorpe
brought
his
sentence
to
a
conclusion
and
glanced
enquiringly
around
the
table
a
man
could
scarcely
disappear
in
a
civilised
neighbourhood
like
this
fentolin
remarked
quietly
but
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
coincidence
about
your
question
may
i
ask
whether
it
was
altogether
a
haphazard
one
absolutely
lord
saxthorpe
declared
the
idea
seems
to
be
that
the
fellow
was
brought
to
one
of
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
and
we
were
all
rather
chaffing
one
another
this
morning
about
it
inspector
yardley
the
stout
fellow
with
the
beard
you
know
was
just
starting
off
in
his
to
make
enquiries
round
the
neighbourhood
if
any
one
in
fiction
wants
a
type
of
the
ridiculous
detective
there
he
is
the
coincidence
of
your
question
fentolin
said
smoothly
is
certainly
a
strange
one
the
mysterious
stranger
is
within
our
lady
saxthorpe
who
had
been
out
of
the
conversation
for
far
too
long
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
my
dear
fentolin
she
exclaimed
my
dear
fentolin
this
is
really
most
exciting
do
tell
us
all
about
it
at
once
i
thought
that
the
man
was
supposed
to
have
been
decoyed
away
in
a
do
you
know
his
name
and
all
about
him
there
are
a
few
minor
points
fentolin
murmured
such
as
his
religious
convictions
and
his
size
in
boots
which
i
could
not
swear
about
but
so
far
as
regards
his
name
and
his
occupation
i
think
i
can
gratify
your
curiosity
he
is
a
john
dunster
and
he
appears
to
be
the
representative
of
an
american
firm
of
bankers
on
his
way
to
germany
to
conclude
a
god
bless
my
soul
lord
saxthorpe
exclaimed
wonderingly
the
fellow
is
actually
here
under
this
roof
but
who
brought
him
how
did
he
find
his
way
better
ask
gerald
fentolin
replied
he
is
the
abductor
it
seems
that
they
both
missed
the
train
from
liverpool
street
and
dunster
invited
gerald
to
travel
down
in
his
special
train
very
kind
of
him
but
might
have
been
very
unlucky
for
gerald
as
you
know
they
got
smashed
up
at
wymondham
and
gerald
feeling
in
a
way
responsible
for
him
brought
him
on
here
quite
properly
i
think
sarson
has
been
looking
after
him
but
i
am
afraid
he
has
slight
concussion
of
the
i
shall
remember
this
all
my
life
lord
saxthorpe
declared
solemnly
as
one
of
the
most
singular
coincidences
which
has
ever
come
within
my
personal
knowledge
perhaps
after
lunch
fentolin
you
will
let
some
of
your
people
telephone
to
the
at
wells
there
really
is
an
important
enquiry
respecting
this
man
i
should
not
be
surprised
he
added
dropping
his
voice
a
little
for
the
benefit
of
the
servants
to
find
that
scotland
yard
needed
him
on
their
own
in
that
case
fentolin
remarked
he
is
quite
safe
for
sarson
tells
me
there
is
no
chance
of
his
being
able
to
travel
at
any
rate
for
lady
saxthorpe
shivered
aren
t
you
afraid
to
have
him
in
the
house
she
asked
a
man
who
is
really
and
actually
wanted
by
scotland
yard
when
one
considers
that
nothing
ever
happens
here
except
an
occasional
shipwreck
in
the
winter
and
a
in
the
summer
it
does
sound
positively
thrilling
i
wonder
what
he
has
they
discussed
the
subject
of
dunster
s
possible
iniquities
meanwhile
a
young
man
carrying
his
hat
in
his
hand
had
slipped
in
past
the
servants
and
was
leaning
over
fentolin
s
chair
he
laid
two
or
three
sheets
of
paper
upon
the
table
and
waited
while
his
employer
glanced
them
through
and
dismissed
him
with
a
little
nod
my
wireless
has
been
busy
this
morning
fentolin
remarked
we
seem
to
have
collected
about
forty
messages
from
different
battleships
and
cruisers
there
must
be
a
whole
squadron
barely
thirty
miles
you
don
t
really
think
lady
saxthorpe
asked
that
there
is
any
fear
of
war
do
you
fentolin
he
answered
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
gravity
who
can
tell
the
papers
this
morning
were
bad
this
conference
at
the
hague
is
still
unexplained
france
s
attitude
in
the
matter
is
especially
i
am
a
strong
supporter
of
lord
roberts
lord
saxthorpe
said
and
i
believe
in
the
vital
necessity
of
some
scheme
for
national
service
at
the
same
time
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
successful
invasion
of
this
country
is
within
the
bounds
of
i
quite
agree
with
you
lord
saxthorpe
fentolin
declared
smoothly
all
the
same
this
hague
conference
is
a
most
mysterious
affair
the
papers
this
morning
are
ominously
silent
about
the
fleet
from
the
tangle
of
messages
we
have
picked
up
i
should
say
without
a
doubt
that
some
form
of
mobilisation
is
going
on
in
the
north
sea
if
lady
saxthorpe
thinks
it
warm
enough
shall
we
take
our
coffee
upon
the
terrace
the
terrace
by
all
means
her
ladyship
assented
rising
from
her
place
what
a
wonderful
man
you
are
fentolin
with
your
wireless
telegraphy
and
your
telegraph
office
in
the
house
and
telephones
does
it
really
amuse
you
to
be
so
modern
to
a
certain
extent
yes
fentolin
sighed
as
he
guided
his
chair
along
the
hall
when
my
misfortune
first
came
i
used
to
speculate
a
good
deal
upon
the
stock
exchange
that
was
really
the
reason
i
went
in
for
all
these
modern
and
now
she
asked
what
use
do
you
make
of
them
now
fentolin
smiled
quietly
he
looked
out
beyond
the
from
whence
had
come
to
him
through
the
clouds
that
tangle
of
messages
i
like
to
feel
he
said
that
the
turning
wheel
of
life
is
not
altogether
out
of
earshot
i
like
to
dabble
just
a
little
in
the
knowledge
of
these
lord
saxthorpe
came
strolling
up
to
them
you
won
t
forget
to
telephone
about
this
guest
of
yours
he
asked
fussily
it
is
already
done
fentolin
assured
him
my
dear
sister
why
so
silent
fentolin
turned
slowly
towards
him
she
too
had
been
standing
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
distant
her
face
seemed
suddenly
to
have
aged
her
forced
vivacity
to
have
departed
her
little
pomeranian
rubbed
against
her
feet
in
vain
yet
at
the
sound
of
fentolin
s
voice
she
seemed
to
come
back
to
herself
as
though
by
magic
i
was
looking
where
you
were
looking
she
declared
lightly
just
trying
to
see
a
little
way
beyond
so
silly
isn
t
it
you
bad
little
dog
come
and
you
shall
have
your
she
strolled
off
humming
a
tune
to
herself
lord
saxthorpe
watched
her
with
a
shadow
upon
his
plain
face
somehow
or
other
he
remarked
quietly
mrs
fentolin
never
seems
to
have
got
over
the
loss
of
her
husband
does
she
how
long
is
it
since
he
died
eight
years
fentolin
replied
it
was
just
six
months
after
my
own
i
am
losing
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
you
fentolin
lady
saxthorpe
confessed
coming
over
to
his
side
you
have
so
many
resources
there
is
so
much
in
life
which
you
can
do
you
paint
as
we
all
know
exquisitely
they
tell
me
that
you
play
the
violin
like
a
master
you
have
unlimited
time
for
reading
and
they
say
that
you
are
one
of
the
greatest
living
authorities
upon
the
politics
of
europe
your
morning
paper
must
bring
you
so
much
that
is
it
is
true
fentolin
admitted
that
i
have
compensations
which
no
one
can
guess
at
compensations
which
appeal
to
me
more
as
time
steals
on
and
yet
he
stopped
short
and
yet
lady
saxthorpe
repeated
interrogatively
fentolin
was
watching
gerald
drive
golf
balls
from
the
lawn
beneath
he
pointed
downwards
i
was
like
that
when
i
was
his
age
he
said
quietly
chapter
xix
fentolin
remained
upon
the
terrace
long
after
the
departure
of
his
guests
he
had
found
a
sunny
corner
out
of
the
wind
and
he
sat
there
with
a
telescope
by
his
side
and
a
budget
of
newspapers
upon
his
knee
on
some
pretext
or
another
he
had
detained
all
the
others
of
the
household
so
that
they
formed
a
little
court
around
him
even
hamel
who
had
said
something
about
a
walk
had
been
induced
to
stop
by
an
appealing
glance
from
esther
fentolin
was
in
one
of
his
most
loquacious
moods
for
some
reason
or
other
the
visit
of
the
saxthorpes
seemed
to
have
excited
him
he
talked
continually
with
the
briefest
pauses
every
now
and
then
he
gazed
steadily
across
the
marshes
through
his
telescope
lord
saxthorpe
he
remarked
has
i
must
confess
greatly
excited
my
curiosity
as
to
the
identity
of
our
visitor
such
a
person
he
seems
to
be
causing
such
a
commotion
gerald
don
t
you
feel
your
responsibility
in
the
matter
yes
sir
i
do
gerald
replied
with
unexpected
grimness
i
feel
my
responsibility
fentolin
who
was
holding
the
telescope
to
his
eye
touched
hamel
on
the
shoulder
my
young
friend
he
said
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
you
see
the
road
there
look
along
it
between
the
white
posts
as
far
as
you
can
what
do
you
make
of
that
black
speck
hamel
held
the
telescope
to
his
eye
and
steadied
it
upon
the
little
tripod
stand
it
looks
like
a
horse
and
trap
he
announced
good
fentolin
declared
it
seemed
so
to
me
but
i
was
not
sure
my
eyes
are
weak
this
afternoon
how
many
people
are
in
the
trap
two
hamel
answered
i
can
see
them
distinctly
now
one
man
is
driving
another
is
sitting
by
his
side
they
are
coming
this
fentolin
blew
his
whistle
meekins
appeared
almost
directly
his
master
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
the
man
at
once
departed
let
me
make
use
of
your
eyes
once
more
fentolin
begged
about
these
two
men
in
the
trap
hamel
is
one
of
them
by
any
chance
wearing
a
uniform
they
both
are
hamel
replied
the
man
who
is
driving
is
wearing
a
peaked
hat
he
looks
like
a
police
inspector
the
man
by
his
side
is
an
ordinary
fentolin
sighed
gently
it
is
very
interesting
he
said
let
us
hope
that
we
shall
not
see
an
arrest
under
my
roof
i
should
feel
it
a
reflection
upon
my
hospitality
i
trust
i
sincerely
trust
that
this
visit
does
not
bode
any
harm
to
john
gerald
rose
impatiently
to
his
feet
and
swung
across
the
terrace
fentolin
however
called
him
back
gerald
he
advised
better
not
go
away
the
inspector
may
desire
to
ask
you
questions
you
will
have
nothing
to
conceal
it
was
a
natural
and
delightful
impulse
of
yours
to
bring
the
man
who
had
befriended
you
and
who
was
your
companion
in
that
disaster
straight
to
your
own
home
for
treatment
and
care
it
was
an
admirable
impulse
my
boy
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
shall
i
tell
him
too
gerald
began
be
careful
fentolin
s
words
seemed
to
be
charged
with
a
swift
note
the
boy
broke
off
in
his
speech
he
looked
at
hamel
and
was
silent
dear
me
fentolin
murmured
i
am
sure
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
talk
about
this
poor
man
as
though
anybody
had
done
anything
wrong
in
having
him
here
this
i
suppose
must
be
the
inspector
yardley
whom
lord
saxthorpe
spoke
a
very
officer
i
am
sure
fentolin
remarked
gerald
go
and
meet
him
if
you
please
i
should
like
to
speak
to
him
out
the
had
drawn
up
at
the
front
door
and
the
inspector
had
already
alighted
gerald
intervened
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
questioning
the
butler
mr
fentolin
would
like
to
speak
to
you
inspector
he
said
if
you
will
come
this
the
inspector
followed
gerald
and
saluted
the
little
group
solemnly
fentolin
held
out
his
hand
you
got
my
telephone
message
inspector
he
asked
we
have
not
received
any
message
that
i
know
of
sir
the
inspector
replied
i
have
come
over
here
in
accordance
with
instructions
received
from
headquarters
in
fact
from
scotland
quite
so
fentolin
assented
you
ve
come
over
i
presume
to
make
enquiries
concerning
john
dunster
that
is
the
name
of
the
gentleman
i
only
understood
from
my
friend
lord
saxthorpe
fentolin
continued
that
dunster
was
being
enquired
about
as
though
he
had
disappeared
my
nephew
brought
him
here
after
the
railway
accident
at
wymondham
since
when
he
has
been
under
the
care
of
my
own
physician
i
trust
that
you
have
nothing
serious
against
him
my
first
duty
sir
the
inspector
pronounced
is
to
see
the
gentleman
in
by
all
means
fentolin
agreed
gerald
will
you
take
the
inspector
up
to
dunster
s
rooms
or
stop
i
will
go
fentolin
started
his
chair
and
beckoned
the
inspector
to
follow
him
meekins
who
was
waiting
inside
the
hall
escorted
them
by
means
of
the
lift
to
the
second
floor
they
made
their
way
to
dunster
s
room
fentolin
knocked
softly
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
the
nurse
how
is
the
patient
fentolin
enquired
doctor
sarson
appeared
from
the
interior
of
the
room
still
unconscious
he
reported
otherwise
the
symptoms
are
favourable
he
is
quite
unfit
the
doctor
added
looking
steadily
at
the
inspector
to
be
removed
or
there
is
no
idea
of
anything
of
the
sort
fentolin
explained
it
is
inspector
yardley
s
duty
to
satisfy
himself
that
dunster
is
here
it
is
necessary
for
the
inspector
to
see
your
patient
so
that
he
can
make
his
report
at
doctor
sarson
bowed
that
is
quite
simple
sir
he
said
please
step
they
all
entered
the
room
which
was
large
and
handsomely
furnished
through
the
open
windows
came
a
gentle
current
of
fresh
air
dunster
lay
in
the
midst
of
all
the
luxury
of
fine
linen
sheets
and
embroidered
the
inspector
looked
at
him
stolidly
is
he
asleep
he
asked
the
doctor
shook
his
head
it
is
the
third
day
of
his
concussion
he
whispered
he
is
still
unconscious
he
will
remain
in
the
same
condition
for
another
two
days
after
that
he
will
begin
to
fentolin
touched
the
inspector
on
the
arm
you
see
his
clothing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
pointed
out
his
linen
is
marked
with
his
name
that
is
his
with
his
name
painted
on
i
am
quite
satisfied
sir
the
inspector
announced
i
will
not
intrude
any
they
left
the
room
fentolin
himself
escorted
the
inspector
into
the
library
and
ordered
whisky
and
cigars
i
don
t
know
whether
i
am
unreasonably
curious
fentolin
remarked
but
is
it
really
true
that
you
have
had
enquiries
from
scotland
yard
about
the
poor
fellow
we
had
a
very
important
enquiry
indeed
sir
the
inspector
replied
i
have
instructions
to
telegraph
all
i
have
been
able
to
discover
pardon
my
putting
it
plainly
fentolin
asked
but
is
our
friend
a
criminal
i
wouldn
t
go
so
far
as
that
sir
the
inspector
answered
i
know
of
no
charge
against
him
i
don
t
know
that
i
have
the
right
to
say
so
much
he
added
sipping
his
whisky
and
soda
but
putting
two
and
two
together
i
should
rather
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
person
of
some
political
not
a
criminal
at
all
not
as
i
know
of
the
inspector
assented
that
isn
t
the
way
i
read
the
enquiries
at
you
relieve
me
fentolin
declared
now
what
about
his
possessions
there
s
a
man
coming
down
shortly
from
scotland
yard
the
inspector
announced
a
little
gloomily
my
orders
were
to
touch
nothing
but
to
locate
well
you
ve
succeeded
so
far
fentolin
remarked
here
he
is
and
here
i
think
he
will
stay
until
some
days
after
your
friend
from
scotland
yard
can
get
it
does
seem
so
indeed
the
inspector
agreed
to
me
he
looks
terrible
ill
but
there
s
one
thing
sure
he
s
having
all
the
care
and
attention
that
s
possible
and
now
sir
i
ll
not
intrude
further
upon
your
time
i
ll
just
make
my
report
and
you
ll
probably
have
a
visit
from
the
scotland
yard
man
sometime
within
the
next
few
fentolin
escorted
the
inspector
to
his
shook
hands
with
him
and
watched
him
drive
off
only
seymour
fentolin
remained
upon
the
terrace
he
glided
over
to
her
side
my
dear
florence
he
asked
where
are
the
others
mr
hamel
and
esther
have
gone
for
a
walk
she
answered
gerald
has
disappeared
somewhere
has
anything
is
everything
all
right
naturally
fentolin
replied
easily
all
that
the
inspector
desired
was
to
see
dunster
he
has
seen
him
the
poor
fellow
was
unfortunately
unconscious
but
our
friend
will
at
least
be
able
to
report
that
he
was
in
good
hands
and
well
cared
unconscious
fentolin
repeated
i
thought
that
he
was
one
is
always
subject
to
those
slight
relapses
in
an
affair
of
concussion
fentolin
explained
fentolin
laid
down
her
work
and
leaned
a
little
towards
her
her
hand
rested
upon
his
her
voice
had
fallen
to
a
whisper
miles
she
said
forgive
me
but
are
you
sure
that
you
are
not
getting
a
little
out
of
your
depth
remember
that
there
are
some
risks
which
are
not
worth
quite
true
he
answered
and
there
are
some
risks
my
dear
florence
which
are
worth
every
drop
of
blood
in
a
man
s
body
and
every
breath
of
life
the
peace
of
europe
turns
upon
that
man
it
is
worth
taking
a
little
risk
for
worth
a
little
danger
i
have
made
my
plans
and
i
mean
to
carry
them
through
tell
me
when
i
was
this
fellow
hamel
was
he
talking
confidentially
to
gerald
not
i
am
not
sure
that
i
trust
him
fentolin
continued
he
had
a
telegram
yesterday
from
a
man
in
the
foreign
office
a
telegram
which
i
did
not
see
he
took
the
trouble
to
walk
three
miles
to
send
the
reply
to
it
from
another
but
after
all
fentolin
protested
you
know
who
he
is
you
know
that
he
is
peter
hamel
s
son
he
had
a
definite
purpose
in
coming
fentolin
nodded
quite
true
he
admitted
but
for
that
hamel
would
have
found
a
little
trouble
before
now
as
it
is
he
must
be
watched
if
any
one
comes
between
me
and
the
things
for
which
i
am
scheming
they
will
risk
fentolin
sighed
she
was
watching
the
figures
of
esther
and
hamel
far
away
in
the
distance
picking
their
way
across
the
last
strip
of
marshland
which
lay
between
them
and
the
sea
miles
she
said
earnestly
you
take
advice
from
no
one
you
will
go
your
own
way
i
know
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
life
holds
so
many
compensations
for
you
without
your
taking
these
terrible
risks
i
am
not
thinking
of
any
one
else
i
am
not
pleading
to
you
for
the
sake
of
any
one
else
i
am
thinking
only
of
yourself
i
have
had
a
sort
of
feeling
ever
since
this
man
was
brought
into
the
house
that
trouble
would
come
of
it
to
me
the
trouble
seems
to
be
gathering
even
fentolin
laughed
softly
a
little
contemptuously
presentiments
he
scoffed
are
the
excuses
of
cowards
don
t
be
afraid
florence
remember
always
that
i
look
ahead
do
you
think
that
i
could
stay
here
contented
with
what
you
call
my
compensations
my
art
the
study
of
beautiful
things
the
calm
epicureanism
of
the
sedate
and
simple
life
you
know
very
well
that
i
could
not
do
that
the
craving
for
other
things
is
in
my
heart
and
blood
the
excitement
which
i
can
not
have
in
one
way
i
must
find
in
another
and
i
think
that
before
many
nights
have
passed
i
shall
lie
on
my
pillow
and
hear
the
guns
roar
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
great
armies
of
the
world
moving
into
battle
it
is
for
that
i
live
she
took
up
her
knitting
again
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
twice
she
opened
her
lips
but
twice
no
words
came
you
understand
he
whispered
you
begin
to
understand
don
t
you
she
looked
at
him
only
for
a
moment
and
back
at
her
work
i
suppose
so
she
sighed
chapter
xx
in
the
middle
of
that
night
hamel
sat
up
in
bed
awakened
with
a
sudden
start
by
some
sound
only
the
faintest
echo
of
which
remained
in
his
consciousness
his
nerves
were
tingling
with
a
sense
of
excitement
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
suddenly
it
came
again
a
long
low
moan
of
pain
stifled
at
the
end
as
though
repressed
by
some
outside
agency
he
leaped
from
his
bed
hurried
on
a
few
clothes
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
landing
the
cry
had
seemed
to
him
to
come
from
the
further
end
of
the
long
corridor
in
the
direction
indeed
of
the
room
where
dunster
lay
he
made
his
way
there
walking
on
tiptoe
although
his
feet
fell
noiselessly
upon
the
thick
carpet
a
single
light
was
burning
from
a
bracket
in
the
wall
insufficient
to
illuminate
the
empty
spaces
but
enough
to
keep
him
from
stumbling
the
corridor
towards
the
south
end
gradually
widened
terminating
in
a
splendid
high
window
with
stained
glass
a
broad
seat
and
a
table
on
the
right
the
end
room
was
dunster
s
apartment
and
on
the
left
a
flight
of
stairs
led
to
the
floor
above
hamel
stood
quite
still
listening
there
was
a
light
in
the
room
as
he
could
see
from
under
the
door
but
there
was
no
sound
of
any
one
moving
hamel
listened
intently
every
sense
strained
then
the
sound
of
a
stair
creaking
behind
diverted
his
attention
he
looked
quickly
around
gerald
was
descending
the
boy
s
face
was
white
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
fear
hamel
stepped
softly
back
from
the
door
and
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
did
you
hear
that
cry
he
whispered
gerald
nodded
it
woke
me
up
what
do
you
suppose
it
was
hamel
shook
his
head
some
one
in
pain
he
replied
i
don
t
understand
it
it
came
from
this
you
know
who
sleeps
there
gerald
asked
hoarsely
hamel
nodded
a
man
with
concussion
of
the
brain
doesn
t
cry
out
like
that
besides
did
you
hear
the
end
of
it
it
sounded
as
though
some
one
were
choking
him
hush
they
had
spoken
only
in
bated
breath
but
the
door
of
the
room
before
which
they
were
standing
was
suddenly
opened
meekins
stood
there
fully
dressed
his
dark
heavy
face
full
of
somber
warning
he
started
a
little
as
he
saw
the
two
whispering
together
gerald
addressed
him
almost
apologetically
we
both
heard
the
same
sound
meekins
is
any
one
ill
it
sounded
like
some
one
in
the
man
hesitated
then
from
behind
his
shoulder
came
fentolin
s
still
soft
voice
there
was
a
little
click
and
meekins
as
though
obeying
an
unseen
gesture
stepped
back
fentolin
glided
on
to
the
threshold
he
was
still
dressed
he
propelled
his
chair
a
few
yards
down
the
corridor
and
beckoned
them
to
approach
i
am
so
sorry
he
said
softly
that
you
should
have
been
disturbed
hamel
we
have
been
a
little
anxious
about
our
mysterious
guest
doctor
sarson
fetched
me
an
hour
ago
he
discovered
that
it
was
necessary
to
perform
a
very
slight
operation
merely
the
extraction
of
a
splinter
of
wood
it
is
all
over
now
and
i
think
that
he
will
do
very
notwithstanding
this
very
plausible
explanation
hamel
was
conscious
of
the
remains
of
an
uneasiness
which
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
put
into
words
it
was
a
most
distressing
cry
he
observed
doubtfully
a
cry
of
fear
as
well
as
of
poor
fellow
fentolin
remarked
compassionately
i
am
afraid
that
for
a
moment
or
two
he
must
have
suffered
acutely
doctor
sarson
is
very
clever
however
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
what
he
did
was
for
the
best
his
opinion
is
that
by
morning
there
will
be
a
marvellous
change
good
night
hamel
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
will
not
be
disturbed
hamel
neither
felt
nor
showed
any
disposition
to
depart
mr
fentolin
he
said
i
hope
that
you
will
not
think
that
i
am
officious
or
in
any
way
abusing
your
hospitality
but
i
can
not
help
suggesting
that
as
sarson
is
purely
your
household
physician
the
relatives
of
this
man
dunster
might
be
better
satisfied
if
some
second
opinion
were
called
in
might
i
suggest
that
you
telephone
to
norwich
for
a
surgeon
fentolin
showed
no
signs
of
displeasure
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
though
considering
the
matter
i
am
not
at
all
sure
hamel
that
you
are
not
right
he
admitted
frankly
i
believe
that
the
case
is
quite
a
simple
one
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
perhaps
be
more
satisfactory
to
have
an
outside
opinion
if
dunster
is
not
conscious
in
the
morning
we
will
telephone
to
the
norwich
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
hamel
agreed
good
night
fentolin
said
once
more
i
am
sorry
that
your
rest
has
been
hamel
however
still
refused
to
take
the
hint
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
that
closed
door
mr
fentolin
he
asked
have
you
any
objection
to
my
seeing
dunster
there
was
a
moment
s
intense
silence
a
sudden
light
had
burned
in
fentolin
s
eyes
his
fingers
gripped
the
side
of
his
chair
yet
when
he
spoke
there
were
no
signs
of
anger
in
his
tone
it
was
a
marvellous
effort
of
there
is
no
reason
hamel
he
said
why
your
curiosity
should
not
be
gratified
knock
softly
at
the
door
the
boy
obeyed
in
a
moment
or
two
doctor
sarson
appeared
on
the
threshold
our
guest
hamel
fentolin
explained
in
a
whisper
has
been
awakened
by
this
poor
fellow
s
cry
he
would
like
to
see
him
for
a
doctor
sarson
opened
the
door
they
all
passed
in
on
tiptoe
the
doctor
led
the
way
towards
the
bed
upon
which
dunster
was
lying
quite
still
his
head
was
bandaged
and
his
eyes
closed
his
face
was
ghastly
gerald
gave
vent
to
a
little
muttered
exclamation
fentolin
turned
to
him
quickly
gerald
the
boy
stood
still
trembling
speechless
fentolin
s
eyes
were
riveted
upon
him
the
doctor
was
standing
still
and
dark
a
motionless
image
is
he
asleep
hamel
asked
he
is
under
the
influence
of
a
mild
anaesthetic
doctor
sarson
explained
he
is
doing
very
well
his
case
is
quite
simple
by
morning
he
will
be
able
to
sit
up
and
walk
about
if
he
wishes
hamel
looked
steadily
at
the
figure
upon
the
bed
dunster
s
breathing
was
regular
and
his
eyes
were
closed
but
his
colour
was
ghastly
he
doesn
t
look
like
getting
up
for
a
good
many
days
to
come
hamel
observed
the
doctor
led
the
way
towards
the
door
the
man
has
a
fine
constitution
he
said
i
feel
sure
that
if
you
wish
you
will
be
able
to
talk
to
him
they
separated
outside
in
the
passage
fentolin
bade
his
guest
a
somewhat
restrained
good
night
and
gerald
mounted
the
staircase
to
his
room
hamel
however
had
scarcely
reached
his
door
before
gerald
reappeared
he
had
descended
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
the
passage
the
doors
were
all
closed
even
the
light
had
been
extinguished
may
i
come
in
for
a
moment
please
he
whispered
hamel
nodded
with
pleasure
come
in
and
have
a
cigarette
if
you
will
i
shan
t
feel
like
sleep
for
some
they
entered
the
room
and
gerald
threw
himself
into
an
near
the
window
hamel
wheeled
up
another
chair
and
produced
a
box
of
cigarettes
queer
thing
your
dropping
across
that
fellow
in
the
way
you
did
he
remarked
just
shows
how
one
may
disappear
from
the
world
altogether
and
no
one
be
a
bit
the
the
boy
was
sitting
with
folded
arms
his
expression
was
one
of
deep
gloom
i
only
wish
i
d
never
brought
him
here
he
muttered
i
ought
to
have
known
hamel
raised
his
eyebrows
isn
t
he
as
well
off
here
as
anywhere
else
do
you
think
that
he
is
gerald
demanded
looking
across
at
hamel
there
was
a
brief
silence
we
can
scarcely
do
your
uncle
the
injustice
hamel
remarked
of
imagining
that
he
can
possibly
have
any
reason
or
any
desire
to
deal
with
that
man
except
as
a
do
you
really
believe
that
gerald
asked
hamel
rose
to
his
feet
look
here
young
man
he
said
this
is
getting
serious
you
and
i
are
at
if
you
like
you
shall
have
the
truth
from
go
i
was
warned
about
your
uncle
before
i
came
down
into
this
part
of
the
world
hamel
continued
quietly
i
was
told
that
he
is
a
dangerous
conspirator
a
man
who
sticks
at
nothing
to
gain
his
ends
a
person
altogether
out
of
place
in
these
days
it
sounds
melodramatic
but
i
had
it
straight
from
a
friend
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
had
a
telegram
you
brought
it
to
me
yourself
asking
for
information
about
this
man
dunster
it
was
i
who
wired
to
london
that
he
was
here
it
was
through
me
that
scotland
yard
communicated
with
the
police
station
at
wells
through
me
that
a
man
is
to
be
sent
down
from
london
i
didn
t
come
here
as
a
spy
don
t
think
that
i
was
coming
here
anyhow
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
that
your
uncle
is
playing
a
dangerous
game
i
am
going
to
have
john
dunster
put
in
charge
of
a
norwich
physician
thank
god
the
boy
murmured
look
here
hamel
continued
what
are
you
doing
in
this
business
anyway
you
are
old
enough
to
know
your
own
mind
and
to
go
your
own
you
say
that
because
you
don
t
know
gerald
declared
bitterly
in
a
sense
i
don
t
hamel
admitted
and
yet
your
sister
hinted
to
me
only
this
afternoon
that
you
and
she
oh
i
know
what
she
told
you
the
boy
interrupted
we
ve
worn
the
chains
for
the
last
eight
years
they
are
breaking
her
they
ve
broken
my
mother
sometimes
i
think
they
are
breaking
me
but
you
know
there
comes
a
time
there
comes
a
time
when
one
can
t
go
on
i
ve
seen
some
strange
things
here
some
that
i
ve
half
understood
some
that
i
haven
t
understood
at
all
i
ve
closed
my
eyes
i
ve
kept
my
promise
i
ve
done
his
bidding
where
ever
it
has
led
me
but
you
know
there
is
a
time
there
is
a
limit
to
all
things
i
can
t
go
on
i
spied
on
this
man
dunster
i
brought
him
here
it
is
i
who
am
responsible
for
anything
that
may
happen
to
him
it
s
the
last
time
gerald
s
face
was
white
with
pain
hamel
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
my
boy
he
said
there
are
worse
things
in
the
world
than
breaking
a
promise
when
you
gave
it
the
conditions
which
were
existing
at
the
time
made
it
perhaps
a
right
and
reasonable
undertaking
but
sometimes
the
whole
of
the
conditions
under
which
a
promise
was
given
change
then
one
must
have
courage
enough
to
be
false
even
to
one
s
have
you
talked
to
my
sister
like
that
gerald
asked
eagerly
i
have
and
i
will
again
hamel
declared
morning
i
leave
this
house
but
before
i
go
i
mean
to
have
the
affair
of
this
man
dunster
cleared
up
your
uncle
will
be
very
angry
with
me
without
a
doubt
i
don
t
care
but
i
do
want
you
to
trust
me
if
you
will
and
your
sister
i
should
like
to
be
your
god
knows
we
need
one
the
boy
said
simply
good
night
once
more
the
house
was
quiet
hamel
pushed
his
window
wide
open
and
looked
out
into
the
night
the
air
was
absolutely
still
there
was
no
wind
the
only
sound
was
the
falling
of
the
low
waves
upon
the
stony
beach
and
the
faint
scrunching
of
the
pebbles
drawn
back
by
the
ebb
he
looked
along
the
row
of
windows
all
dark
and
silent
now
a
rush
of
pleasant
fancies
suddenly
chased
away
the
grim
depression
of
the
last
few
minutes
out
of
all
this
sordidness
and
mystery
there
remained
at
least
something
in
life
for
him
to
do
a
certain
aimlessness
of
purpose
which
had
troubled
him
during
the
last
few
months
had
disappeared
he
had
found
an
object
in
life
chapter
xxi
hamel
declared
as
he
stood
at
the
sideboard
the
following
morning
at
and
helped
himself
to
bacon
and
eggs
i
am
positively
going
to
begin
reading
i
have
a
case
full
of
books
down
at
the
tower
which
i
haven
t
unpacked
esther
made
a
little
grimace
look
at
the
sunshine
she
said
there
isn
t
a
breath
of
wind
either
i
think
that
i
could
play
from
the
men
s
hamel
sighed
as
he
returned
to
his
place
my
good
intentions
are
already
half
dissipated
he
admitted
she
laughed
how
can
we
attack
the
other
half
she
asked
gerald
who
was
also
on
his
way
to
the
sideboard
suddenly
stopped
hullo
he
exclaimed
looking
out
of
the
window
who
s
going
away
this
morning
i
wonder
there
s
the
at
the
hamel
too
rose
once
more
to
his
feet
the
two
exchanged
swift
glances
moved
by
a
common
thought
they
both
started
for
the
door
only
to
find
it
suddenly
opened
before
them
fentolin
glided
into
the
room
uncle
gerald
exclaimed
fentolin
glanced
keenly
around
the
room
good
morning

he
said
my
appearance
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
naturally
surprises

a
matter
of
fact

been
up

quite
a
long
time
esther

incredulously

is
going
fentolin
admitted

my
hands
of
the
man
he
has
given
us
an
infinite
amount
of
trouble
has
monopolised
doctor
sarson
when
he
ought
to
have
been
attending
upon
me
a
little
more
hot
milk
if
you
please
esther
and
now
although
he
really
is
not
fit
to
leave
his
room
he
insists
upon
hurrying
off
to
keep
an
appointment
somewhere
on
the
continent
the
little
operation
we
spoke
of
last
night
was
successful
as
doctor
sarson
prophesied
and
dunster
was
quite
conscious
and
able
to
sit
up
early
this
morning
we
telephoned
at
six
o
clock
to
norwich
for
a
surgeon
who
is
now
on
his
way
over
here
but
he
will
not
wait
even
to
see
him
what
can
you
do
with
a
man
so
obstinate
neither
hamel
nor
gerald
had
resumed
their
places
the
former
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
turned
towards
the
door
i
think
he
said
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
last
of
pray
do
fentolin
begged
i
have
said
to
him
myself
and
all
that
i
hope
is
that
next
time
you
offer
a
wayfarer
the
hospitality
of
david
s
hall
gerald
he
may
be
a
more
tractable
person
this
morning
i
shall
give
myself
a
treat
i
shall
eat
an
english
breakfast
close
the
door
after
you
if
you
please
hamel
with
gerald
by
his
side
hurried
out
into
the
hall
just
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
they
saw
dunster
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
his
long
ulster
a
soft
hat
upon
his
head
and
one
of
fentolin
s
cigars
in
his
mouth
step
from
the
bottom
stair
into
the
hall
and
make
his
way
with
somewhat
uncertain
footsteps
towards
the
front
door
doctor
sarson
walked
on
one
side
and
meekins
held
him
by
the
arm
he
glanced
towards
gerald
and
his
companion
and
waved
the
hand
which
held
his
cigar
so
long
my
young
friend
he
exclaimed
you
see
i
ve
got
them
to
let
me
make
a
start
next
time
we
go
about
the
country
in
a
saloon
car
together
i
hope
we
ll
have
better
luck
say
but
i
m
groggy
about
the
knees
you
d
better
save
your
breath
doctor
sarson
advised
him
grimly
you
haven
t
any
to
spare
now
and
you
ll
want
more
than
you
have
before
you
get
to
the
end
of
your
journey
carefully
down
the
steps
they
helped
him
into
the
car
hamel
and
gerald
stood
under
the
great
stone
portico
watching
well
i
m
jiggered
the
boy
exclaimed
under
his
breath
hamel
was
watching
the
proceedings
with
a
puzzled
frown
to
his
surprise
neither
doctor
sarson
nor
meekins
were
accompanying
the
departing
man
he
s
off
right
enough
hamel
declared
as
the
car
glided
away
do
you
understand
it
i
don
gerald
did
not
speak
for
several
moments
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
the
back
of
the
disappearing
car
then
he
turned
towards
hamel
there
isn
t
much
he
said
softly
that
fentolin
doesn
t
know
if
that
detective
was
really
on
his
way
here
there
wasn
t
any
chance
of
keeping
dunster
to
himself
you
see
the
whole
story
is
common
property
and
yet
there
s
something
about
the
affair
that
bothers
and
me
hamel
admitted
watching
the
car
until
it
became
a
speck
in
the
distance
he
was
fairly
well
cornered
gerald
concluded
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
but
it
isn
t
like
him
to
let
go
of
anything
so
so
you
ve
seen
the
last
of
our
guest
fentolin
remarked
as
hamel
and
gerald
the
a
queer
fellow
almost
a
new
type
to
me
dogged
and
industrious
i
should
think
he
hadn
t
the
least
right
to
travel
you
know
and
i
think
so
long
as
we
had
taken
the
trouble
to
telephone
to
norwich
he
might
have
waited
to
see
the
physician
sarson
was
very
angry
about
it
but
what
can
you
do
with
these
fellows
who
are
never
ill
they
scarcely
know
what
physical
disability
means
well
hamel
and
how
are
you
going
to
amuse
yourself
i
had
thought
of
commencing
some
reading
i
brought
with
me
hamel
replied
but
miss
esther
has
challenged
me
to
another
game
of
excellent
fentolin
declared
it
is
very
kind
of
you
indeed
hamel
it
is
always
a
matter
of
regret
for
me
that
society
in
these
parts
is
so
restricted
my
nephew
and
niece
have
little
opportunity
for
enjoying
themselves
play
golf
with
hamel
by
all
means
my
dear
child
he
continued
turning
to
his
niece
make
the
most
of
this
glorious
spring
weather
and
what
about
you
gerald
what
are
you
doing
i
haven
t
made
up
my
mind
yet
sir
the
boy
replied
fentolin
sighed
always
that
lack
of
initiative
he
remarked
a
lack
of
initiative
is
one
of
your
worst
faults
i
am
afraid
dear
the
boy
looked
up
quickly
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
about
to
make
a
fierce
reply
he
met
fentolin
s
steady
gaze
however
and
the
words
died
away
upon
his
lips
i
rather
thought
he
said
of
going
into
norwich
if
you
could
spare
me
captain
holt
has
asked
me
to
lunch
at
the
fentolin
shook
his
head
gently
it
is
most
unfortunate
he
declared
i
have
a
commission
for
you
later
in
the
gerald
continued
his
breakfast
in
silence
he
bent
over
his
plate
so
that
his
face
was
almost
invisible
fentolin
was
peeling
a
peach
a
servant
entered
the
room
lieutenant
godfrey
sir
he
announced
they
all
looked
up
a
trim
young
man
in
naval
uniform
was
standing
upon
the
threshold
he
bowed
to
esther
very
sorry
to
intrude
sir
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
he
said
briskly
lieutenant
godfrey
my
name
i
am
flag
lieutenant
of
the
britannia
you
can
t
see
her
but
she
s
not
fifty
miles
off
at
this
minute
i
landed
at
sheringham
this
morning
hired
a
car
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
here
message
from
the
admiral
fentolin
smiled
genially
we
are
delighted
to
see
you
lieutenant
godfrey
he
said
have
some
you
are
very
good
sir
the
officer
answered
business
first
i
ll
breakfast
afterwards
with
pleasure
if
i
may
the
admiral
s
compliments
and
he
would
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
would
haul
down
your
wireless
for
a
few
haul
down
my
wireless
fentolin
repeated
slowly
we
are
doing
a
lot
of
manoeuvring
within
range
of
you
and
likely
to
do
a
bit
more
the
young
man
explained
you
are
catching
up
our
messages
all
the
time
of
course
we
know
they
re
quite
safe
with
you
but
things
get
about
as
yours
is
only
a
private
installation
we
d
like
you
if
you
don
t
mind
sir
to
shut
up
shop
for
a
few
fentolin
seemed
puzzled
but
my
dear
sir
he
protested
we
are
not
at
war
are
we
not
yet
the
young
officer
replied
but
god
knows
when
we
shall
be
we
are
under
sealed
orders
anyway
and
we
don
t
want
any
risk
of
our
plans
leaking
out
that
s
why
we
want
your
wireless
you
need
say
no
more
fentolin
assured
him
the
matter
is
already
arranged
esther
let
me
present
lieutenant
godfrey
my
niece
miss
fentolin
gerald
fentolin
my
nephew
hamel
a
guest
see
that
lieutenant
godfrey
has
some
breakfast
gerald
i
will
go
myself
and
see
my
marconi
awfully
good
of
you
sir
the
young
man
declared
and
i
am
sure
we
are
very
sorry
to
trouble
you
in
a
week
or
two
s
time
you
can
go
into
business
again
as
much
as
you
like
it
s
only
while
we
are
fiddling
around
here
that
the
admiral
s
jumpy
about
things
may
my
man
have
a
cup
of
coffee
sir
i
d
like
to
be
on
the
way
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
fentolin
halted
his
chair
by
the
side
of
the
bell
and
rang
it
pray
make
use
of
my
house
as
your
own
sir
he
said
gravely
from
what
you
leave
unsaid
i
gather
that
things
are
more
serious
than
the
papers
would
have
us
believe
under
those
circumstances
i
need
not
assure
you
that
any
help
we
can
render
is
entirely
fentolin
left
the
room
lieutenant
godfrey
was
already
attacking
his
breakfast
gerald
leaned
towards
him
eagerly
is
there
really
going
to
be
war
he
demanded
ask
those
chaps
at
the
hague
lieutenant
godfrey
answered
doing
their
best
to
freeze
us
out
or
something
all
i
know
is
if
there
s
going
to
be
fighting
we
are
ready
for
them
what
have
you
got
wireless
telegraphy
for
here
anyway
it
s
a
fad
of
my
uncle
s
gerald
replied
since
his
accident
he
amuses
himself
in
all
sorts
of
queer
lieutenant
godfrey
nodded
poor
fellow
he
said
i
heard
he
was
a
cripple
or
something
of
the
sort
forgive
my
asking
but
you
people
are
english
aren
t
you
rather
gerald
answered
the
fentolins
have
lived
here
for
hundreds
of
years
why
do
you
ask
that
lieutenant
godfrey
hesitated
he
looked
for
the
moment
scarcely
at
his
ease
oh
i
don
t
know
he
replied
the
old
man
was
very
anxious
i
should
find
out
you
see
a
lot
of
information
seems
to
have
got
over
on
the
other
side
and
we
couldn
t
think
where
it
had
leaked
out
except
through
your
wireless
however
that
isn
t
likely
of
course
unless
you
ve
got
one
of
these
beastly
germans
in
your
now
if
i
can
borrow
a
cigarette
a
cigar
or
a
pipe
of
tobacco
any
mortal
thing
to
smoke
i
ll
be
off
if
i
may
the
old
man
turned
me
out
at
an
unearthly
hour
this
morning
and
in
sheringham
all
the
shops
were
closed
steady
on
young
fellow
he
laughed
as
gerald
filled
his
pockets
with
cigarettes
well
here
s
good
morning
to
you
miss
fentolin
good
morning
sir
how
long
ought
it
to
take
me
to
get
to
sheringham
about
forty
minutes
gerald
told
him
if
your
car
s
any
good
at
it
isn
t
much
was
the
somewhat
dubious
reply
however
we
ll
shove
along
you
in
the
service
he
enquired
as
they
walked
down
the
hall
together
hope
i
shall
be
before
long
gerald
answered
i
m
going
into
the
army
have
to
hurry
up
won
t
you
gerald
sighed
it
s
a
little
difficult
for
me
here
s
your
car
good
luck
to
you
my
excuses
to
fentolin
lieutenant
godfrey
shouted
and
many
he
jumped
into
the
automobile
and
was
soon
on
his
way
back
gerald
watched
him
until
he
was
nearly
out
of
sight
on
the
knoll
two
of
the
wireless
operators
were
already
at
work
fentolin
sat
in
his
chair
below
watching
the
blue
sparks
were
flashing
a
message
was
just
being
delivered
presently
fentolin
turned
his
chair
and
with
meekins
by
his
side
made
his
way
back
to
the
house
he
passed
along
the
hall
and
into
his
study
gerald
who
was
on
his
way
to
the
heard
the
ring
of
the
telephone
bell
and
the
call
for
the
trunk
special
line
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
made
his
way
slowly
down
towards
the
study
and
stood
outside
the
door
listening
in
a
moment
he
heard
fentolin
s
clear
voice
very
low
yet
very
penetrating
the
mediterranean
fleet
will
be
hours
before
it
comes
together
was
the
message
he
heard
the
channel
fleet
will
manoeuvre
off
sheerness
waiting
for
it
the
north
sea
fleet
is
seventeen
units
under
nominal
gerald
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
slowly
and
entered
fentolin
was
just
replacing
the
receiver
on
its
stand
he
looked
up
at
his
nephew
and
his
eyebrows
came
together
what
do
you
mean
by
this
he
demanded
don
t
you
know
that
i
allow
no
one
in
here
when
i
am
telephoning
on
the
private
wire
gerald
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
summoned
up
all
his
courage
it
is
because
i
have
heard
what
you
were
saying
over
the
telephone
that
i
am
here
he
declared
i
want
to
know
to
whom
you
were
sending
that
message
which
you
have
intercepted
chapter
xxii
fentolin
sat
for
a
moment
in
his
chair
with
immovable
face
then
he
pointed
to
the
door
which
gerald
had
left
open
behind
him
close
that
door
the
boy
obeyed
fentolin
waited
until
he
had
turned
around
again
come
and
stand
over
here
by
the
side
of
the
table
he
directed
gerald
came
without
hesitation
he
stood
before
his
uncle
with
folded
arms
there
was
something
else
besides
sullenness
in
his
face
this
morning
something
which
fentolin
was
quick
to
recognise
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
nature
of
your
question
gerald
fentolin
began
it
is
unlike
you
you
do
not
seem
yourself
is
there
anything
in
particular
the
matter
only
this
gerald
answered
firmly
i
don
t
understand
why
this
naval
fellow
should
come
here
and
ask
you
to
close
up
your
wireless
because
secrets
have
been
leaking
out
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
you
should
be
picking
up
a
message
and
telephoning
to
london
information
which
was
surely
meant
to
be
private
that
s
all
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
about
you
heard
the
message
then
i
you
listened
at
the
keyhole
i
listened
outside
gerald
assented
doggedly
i
am
glad
i
listened
do
you
mind
answering
my
question
do
i
mind
fentolin
repeated
softly
really
gerald
your
politeness
your
consideration
your
good
manners
astound
me
i
am
positively
deprived
of
the
power
of
i
ll
wait
here
till
it
comes
to
you
again
then
the
boy
declared
bluntly
i
ve
waited
on
you
hand
and
foot
done
dirty
work
for
you
put
up
with
your
and
your
tyranny
and
never
grumbled
but
there
is
a
limit
you
ve
made
a
poor
sort
of
creature
of
me
but
even
the
worm
turns
you
know
when
it
comes
to
giving
away
secrets
about
the
movements
of
our
navy
at
a
time
when
we
are
almost
at
war
i
melodramatic
almost
dramatic
but
alas
so
inaccurate
fentolin
sighed
is
this
a
fit
of
the
heroics
boy
or
what
has
come
over
you
have
you
by
any
chance
forgotten
fentolin
s
voice
seemed
suddenly
to
have
grown
in
volume
his
eyes
dilated
he
himself
seemed
to
have
grown
in
size
gerald
stepped
a
little
back
he
was
trembling
but
his
expression
had
not
changed
no
i
haven
t
forgotten
there
s
a
great
debt
we
are
doing
our
best
to
pay
but
there
s
such
a
thing
as
asking
too
much
there
s
such
a
thing
as
drawing
the
cords
to
snapping
point
i
m
speaking
for
esther
and
mother
as
well
as
myself
we
have
been
your
slaves
in
a
way
i
suppose
we
are
willing
to
go
on
being
your
slaves
it
s
the
burden
that
fate
has
placed
around
our
necks
and
we
ll
go
through
with
it
all
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
there
are
limits
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
up
against
them
fentolin
nodded
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
be
reasonable
you
are
very
young
my
boy
he
said
very
young
indeed
perhaps
that
is
my
fault
for
not
having
let
you
see
more
of
the
world
you
have
got
some
very
queer
ideas
into
your
head
a
little
too
much
novel
reading
lately
eh
i
might
treat
you
differently
i
might
laugh
at
you
and
send
you
out
of
the
room
i
won
t
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
ask
i
ll
explain
what
you
find
so
mysterious
the
person
to
whom
i
have
been
speaking
is
my
your
stockbroker
gerald
exclaimed
fentolin
nodded
mr
bayliss
he
continued
of
the
firm
of
bayliss
hundercombe
dunn
throgmorton
court
bayliss
is
a
man
of
keen
perceptions
he
understands
exactly
the
effect
of
certain
classes
of
news
upon
the
market
the
message
which
i
have
just
sent
to
him
is
practically
common
property
it
will
be
in
the
daily
mail
morning
the
only
thing
is
that
i
have
sent
it
to
him
just
a
few
minutes
sooner
than
any
one
else
can
get
it
there
is
a
good
deal
of
value
in
that
gerald
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
that
i
have
made
a
large
fortune
through
studying
the
political
situation
and
securing
advance
information
upon
matters
of
this
sort
that
fortune
some
day
will
probably
be
yours
it
will
be
you
who
will
benefit
meanwhile
i
am
enriching
myself
and
doing
no
one
any
but
how
do
you
know
gerald
persisted
that
this
message
would
ever
have
found
its
way
to
the
press
it
was
simply
a
message
from
one
battleship
to
another
it
was
not
intended
to
be
picked
up
on
land
there
is
no
other
installation
but
ours
that
could
have
picked
it
up
besides
it
was
in
code
i
know
that
you
have
the
code
but
the
others
haven
fentolin
yawned
slightly
ingenious
my
dear
gerald
but
inaccurate
you
do
not
know
that
the
message
was
in
code
and
in
any
case
it
was
liable
to
be
picked
up
by
any
steamer
within
the
circle
you
really
do
treat
me
my
boy
rather
as
though
i
were
a
weird
person
with
a
talent
for
intrigue
and
crime
of
every
sort
look
at
your
suspicions
last
night
i
believe
that
you
and
hamel
had
quite
made
up
your
minds
that
i
meant
evil
things
for
john
dunster
well
i
had
my
chance
you
saw
him
what
about
his
papers
i
will
admit
fentolin
replied
that
i
read
his
papers
they
were
of
no
great
consequence
however
and
he
has
taken
them
away
with
him
dunster
as
a
matter
of
fact
turned
out
to
be
rather
a
mare
now
come
since
you
are
here
finish
everything
you
have
to
say
to
me
i
am
not
angry
i
am
willing
to
listen
quite
gerald
shook
his
head
oh
i
can
t
he
declared
bitterly
you
always
get
the
best
of
it
i
ll
only
ask
you
one
more
question
are
you
having
the
wireless
hauled
down
fentolin
pointed
out
of
the
window
gerald
followed
his
finger
three
men
were
at
work
upon
the
towering
spars
you
see
fentolin
continued
tolerantly
that
i
am
keeping
my
word
to
lieutenant
godfrey
you
are
suffering
from
a
little
too
much
imagination
i
am
afraid
it
is
really
quite
a
good
fault
how
do
you
get
on
with
our
friend
hamel
very
well
the
boy
replied
i
haven
t
seen
much
of
he
and
esther
are
together
a
great
deal
eh
fentolin
asked
quickly
they
seem
to
be
quite
it
isn
t
hamel
by
any
chance
who
has
been
putting
these
ideas
into
your
head
no
one
has
been
putting
any
ideas
into
my
head
gerald
answered
hotly
it
s
simply
what
i
ve
seen
and
overheard
it
s
simply
what
i
feel
around
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
the
whole
atmosphere
you
seem
to
create
around
you
with
these
brutes
sarson
and
meekins
and
those
marconi
men
of
yours
who
can
t
talk
decent
english
and
the
man
who
can
t
look
you
in
the
face
and
miss
price
who
looks
as
though
she
were
one
of
the
creatures
too
of
your
torture
chamber
that
s
fentolin
waited
until
he
had
finished
then
he
waved
him
away
go
and
take
a
long
walk
gerald
he
advised
fresh
air
is
what
you
need
fresh
air
and
a
little
vigorous
exercise
run
along
now
and
send
miss
price
to
gerald
overtook
hamel
upon
the
stairs
by
this
time
the
latter
remarked
i
suppose
that
our
friend
dunster
is
upon
the
gerald
nodded
silently
they
passed
along
the
corridor
the
door
of
the
room
which
dunster
had
occupied
was
ajar
as
though
by
common
consent
they
both
stopped
and
looked
in
the
windows
were
all
wide
open
the
bed
freshly
made
the
nurse
was
busy
collecting
some
medicine
bottles
and
fragments
of
lint
she
looked
at
them
in
surprise
mr
dunster
has
left
sir
she
told
them
we
saw
him
go
gerald
replied
rather
a
quick
recovery
wasn
t
it
nurse
hamel
asked
it
wasn
t
a
recovery
at
all
sir
the
woman
declared
sharply
he
d
no
right
to
have
been
taken
away
it
s
my
opinion
doctor
sarson
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
to
have
permitted
they
couldn
t
exactly
make
a
prison
of
the
place
could
they
hamel
pointed
out
the
man
after
all
was
only
a
that
s
as
it
may
be
sir
the
nurse
replied
all
the
same
those
that
won
t
obey
their
doctors
aren
t
fit
to
be
allowed
about
alone
that
s
the
way
i
look
at
fentolin
was
passing
along
the
corridor
as
they
issued
from
the
room
she
started
a
little
as
she
saw
them
what
have
you
two
been
doing
in
there
she
asked
quickly
we
were
just
passing
hamel
explained
we
stopped
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
the
mr
dunster
has
gone
she
said
you
saw
him
go
gerald
you
saw
him
too
didn
t
you
hamel
i
certainly
did
hamel
admitted
fentolin
pointed
to
the
great
north
window
near
which
they
were
standing
through
which
the
clear
sunlight
streamed
a
little
pitilessly
upon
her
worn
face
and
mass
of
dyed
hair
you
ought
neither
of
you
to
be
indoors
for
a
minute
on
a
morning
like
this
she
declared
esther
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
car
i
think
gerald
passed
on
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
but
hamel
lingered
a
curious
impulse
of
pity
towards
his
hostess
stirred
him
the
morning
sunlight
seemed
to
have
suddenly
revealed
the
tragedy
of
her
life
she
stood
there
a
tired
worn
woman
with
the
burden
heavy
upon
her
shoulders
why
not
come
out
with
miss
fentolin
and
me
he
suggested
we
could
lunch
at
the
golf
club
out
on
the
balcony
i
wish
you
would
can
t
you
manage
it
she
shook
her
head
thank
you
very
much
she
said
mr
fentolin
does
not
like
to
be
something
in
the
finality
of
her
words
seemed
to
him
curiously
eloquent
of
her
state
of
mind
she
did
not
move
on
she
seemed
indeed
to
have
the
air
of
one
anxious
to
say
more
in
that
ruthless
light
the
advantages
of
her
elegant
clothes
and
graceful
carriage
were
suddenly
stripped
away
from
her
she
was
the
abject
wreck
of
a
beautiful
woman
wizened
prematurely
aged
nothing
remained
but
the
eyes
which
seemed
somehow
to
have
their
message
for
him
mr
fentolin
is
a
little
peculiar
you
know
she
went
on
her
voice
shaking
slightly
with
the
effort
she
was
making
to
keep
it
low
he
allows
esther
so
little
liberty
she
sees
so
few
young
people
of
her
own
age
i
do
not
know
why
he
allows
you
to
be
with
her
so
much
be
careful
her
voice
seemed
suddenly
to
vibrate
with
a
curious
note
of
suppressed
fear
almost
as
she
finished
her
speech
she
passed
on
her
little
gesture
bade
him
remain
silent
as
she
went
up
the
stairs
she
began
to
hum
scraps
of
a
little
french
air
chapter
xxiii
hamel
sliced
his
ball
at
the
ninth
and
after
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
patiently
esther
came
to
help
him
look
for
it
he
was
standing
down
on
the
sands
a
little
apart
from
the
two
caddies
who
were
beating
out
various
tufts
of
long
grass
where
did
it
go
she
asked
i
have
no
idea
he
admitted
why
don
t
you
help
look
for
it
searching
for
balls
he
insisted
is
a
caddy
s
occupation
both
the
caddies
are
now
busy
let
us
sit
down
here
these
sand
hummocks
are
delightful
it
is
perfectly
sheltered
and
the
sun
is
in
our
faces
golf
is
an
overrated
pastime
let
us
sit
and
watch
that
little
streak
of
blue
find
its
way
up
between
the
white
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
we
shall
lose
our
there
is
no
one
she
sank
on
to
the
little
knoll
of
sand
to
which
he
had
pointed
with
a
resigned
sigh
you
really
are
a
queer
person
she
declared
you
have
been
playing
golf
this
morning
as
though
your
very
life
depended
upon
it
you
have
scarcely
missed
a
shot
or
spoken
a
word
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
you
want
to
sit
on
a
sand
hummock
and
watch
the
i
have
been
silent
he
told
her
because
i
have
been
that
may
be
truthful
she
remarked
but
you
wouldn
t
call
it
polite
would
you
the
subject
of
my
thoughts
is
my
excuse
i
have
been
thinking
of
for
a
single
moment
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
caught
something
of
that
sympathetic
light
with
which
he
was
regarding
her
then
she
looked
away
was
it
my
mashie
shots
you
were
worrying
about
she
asked
it
was
not
he
replied
simply
it
was
you
you
she
laughed
not
altogether
naturally
how
flattering
she
murmured
you
are
rather
a
downright
person
aren
t
you
hamel
so
much
so
he
admitted
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
one
or
two
things
now
i
am
going
to
be
very
frank
she
sat
suddenly
quite
still
her
face
was
turned
from
him
but
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
there
was
a
slight
undertone
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
a
week
ago
he
said
i
hadn
t
the
faintest
idea
of
coming
into
norfolk
i
knew
about
this
little
shanty
of
my
father
s
but
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
i
came
as
the
result
of
a
conversation
i
had
with
a
friend
who
is
in
the
foreign
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
quickly
you
are
hamel
aren
t
you
certainly
he
replied
not
only
am
i
richard
hamel
mining
engineer
but
i
really
have
all
that
reading
to
do
i
have
spoken
about
and
i
really
was
looking
for
a
quiet
spot
to
do
it
in
it
is
true
that
i
had
this
part
of
the
world
in
my
mind
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
should
ever
have
really
decided
to
come
here
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
friend
in
london
he
was
very
interested
indeed
directly
i
mentioned
david
s
tower
would
you
like
to
know
what
he
told
me
yes
go
on
he
told
me
a
little
of
the
history
of
your
uncle
fentolin
and
what
he
did
not
tell
me
at
the
time
he
has
since
supplemented
i
suppose
he
added
hesitatingly
that
you
yourself
please
go
on
please
speak
as
though
i
knew
well
then
hamel
continued
he
told
me
that
your
uncle
was
at
one
time
in
the
foreign
office
himself
he
seemed
to
have
a
most
brilliant
career
before
him
when
suddenly
there
was
a
terrible
scandal
a
political
secret
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
had
leaked
out
there
were
rumours
that
it
had
been
acquired
for
a
large
sum
of
money
by
a
foreign
power
fentolin
retired
to
norfolk
pending
an
investigation
it
was
just
as
that
time
that
he
met
with
his
terrible
accident
and
the
matter
was
go
on
please
she
murmured
my
friend
went
on
to
say
that
during
the
last
few
years
fentolin
has
once
again
become
an
object
of
some
suspicion
to
the
head
of
our
secret
service
department
for
a
long
time
they
have
known
that
he
was
employing
agents
abroad
and
that
he
was
showing
the
liveliest
interest
in
underground
politics
they
believed
that
it
was
a
mere
hobby
born
of
his
useless
condition
a
taste
ministered
to
without
doubt
by
the
occupation
of
his
earlier
life
once
or
twice
lately
they
have
had
reason
to
change
their
minds
you
know
i
dare
say
in
what
a
terribly
disturbed
state
european
affairs
are
just
now
well
my
friend
had
an
idea
that
fentolin
was
showing
an
extraordinary
amount
of
interest
in
a
certain
conference
which
we
understand
is
to
take
place
at
the
hague
he
begged
me
to
come
down
and
to
watch
your
uncle
while
i
was
down
here
and
report
to
him
anything
that
seemed
to
me
noteworthy
since
then
i
have
had
a
message
from
him
concerning
the
american
whom
you
entertained
john
dunster
it
appears
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
very
important
dispatches
for
the
but
he
has
gone
she
said
quickly
nothing
happened
to
him
after
all
he
went
away
without
a
word
of
complaint
we
all
saw
that
is
quite
true
hamel
admitted
mr
dunster
has
certainly
gone
it
is
rather
a
coincidence
however
that
he
should
have
taken
his
departure
just
as
the
enquiries
concerning
his
whereabouts
had
reached
such
a
stage
that
it
had
become
quite
impossible
to
keep
him
concealed
any
she
turned
a
little
in
her
place
and
looked
at
him
steadfastly
mr
hamel
she
said
tell
me
what
of
your
mission
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
my
uncle
you
have
even
lived
under
his
roof
tell
me
what
you
his
face
was
troubled
miss
fentolin
he
said
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
up
to
now
i
have
not
succeeded
in
solving
the
problem
of
your
uncle
s
character
to
me
personally
he
has
been
most
courteous
he
lives
apparently
a
studious
and
an
unselfish
life
i
have
heard
him
even
spoken
of
as
a
philanthropist
and
yet
you
three
you
your
mother
and
your
brother
who
are
nearest
to
him
who
live
in
his
house
and
under
his
protection
have
the
air
of
passing
your
days
in
mortal
fear
of
mr
hamel
she
exclaimed
nervously
you
don
t
believe
that
he
is
always
very
apparently
hamel
observed
drily
and
yet
you
must
remember
that
you
too
are
afraid
of
him
i
need
not
remind
you
of
our
conversations
but
there
the
truth
is
you
praise
his
virtues
and
his
charities
you
pity
him
and
yet
you
go
about
with
a
load
of
fear
and
forgive
me
of
secret
terror
in
your
heart
you
and
gerald
too
as
for
your
mother
don
t
she
interrupted
suddenly
why
do
you
bring
me
here
to
talk
like
this
you
can
not
alter
things
nothing
can
be
can
t
it
he
replied
well
i
will
tell
you
the
real
reason
of
my
having
brought
you
here
and
of
my
having
made
this
confession
i
brought
you
here
because
i
could
not
bear
to
go
on
living
if
not
under
your
roof
at
any
rate
in
the
neighbourhood
without
telling
you
the
truth
now
you
know
it
i
am
here
to
watch
fentolin
i
am
going
on
watching
him
you
can
put
him
on
his
guard
if
you
like
i
shan
t
complain
or
you
can
he
paused
so
long
that
she
looked
at
him
he
moved
a
little
closer
to
her
his
fingers
suddenly
gripped
her
hand
or
you
can
marry
me
and
come
away
from
it
all
he
concluded
quietly
forgive
me
please
i
mean
for
a
moment
the
startled
light
in
her
eyes
was
followed
by
a
delicious
softness
her
lips
were
parted
she
leaned
a
little
towards
him
then
suddenly
she
seemed
to
remember
she
rose
with
swift
alertness
to
her
feet
i
think
she
said
that
we
had
better
play
but
i
have
asked
you
to
marry
me
he
protested
as
he
scrambled
up
your
caddy
has
found
your
ball
a
long
time
ago
she
pointed
out
walking
swiftly
on
ahead
he
played
his
shot
and
caught
her
up
miss
fentolin
esther
he
pleaded
eagerly
do
you
think
that
i
am
not
in
earnest
because
i
am
i
mean
it
even
if
i
have
only
known
you
for
a
few
days
it
has
been
enough
i
think
that
i
knew
it
was
coming
from
the
moment
that
you
stepped
into
my
railway
you
knew
that
what
was
coming
she
asked
raising
her
eyes
suddenly
that
i
should
care
for
it
s
the
first
time
you
ve
told
me
she
reminded
him
with
a
queer
little
smile
oh
forgive
me
please
i
didn
t
mean
to
say
that
i
don
t
want
to
have
you
tell
me
so
it
s
all
too
ridiculous
and
is
it
and
why
i
have
only
known
you
for
three
we
can
make
up
for
but
i
don
t
care
about
you
i
have
never
thought
of
any
one
in
that
way
it
is
absurd
she
went
on
you
ll
have
to
sometime
or
other
he
declared
i
ll
take
you
travelling
with
me
show
you
the
world
new
worlds
unnamed
rivers
untrodden
mountains
or
do
you
want
to
go
and
see
where
the
little
brown
people
live
among
the
mimosa
and
the
cherry
blossoms
i
ll
take
you
so
far
away
that
this
place
and
this
life
will
seem
like
a
her
breath
caught
a
little
don
t
please
she
begged
you
know
very
well
or
rather
you
don
t
know
perhaps
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
couldn
t
i
am
here
tied
and
bound
and
i
can
t
ah
dear
don
t
believe
it
he
went
on
earnestly
there
isn
t
any
bond
so
strong
that
i
won
t
break
it
for
you
no
knot
i
won
t
untie
if
you
give
me
the
they
were
climbing
slowly
on
to
the
tee
he
stepped
forward
and
pulled
her
up
her
hand
was
cold
her
eyes
were
raised
to
his
very
softly
yet
almost
pleadingly
please
don
t
say
anything
more
she
begged
i
can
t
quite
bear
it
just
now
you
know
you
must
remember
there
is
my
mother
do
you
think
that
i
could
leave
her
to
struggle
alone
his
caddy
who
had
teed
the
ball
and
who
had
regarded
the
proceedings
with
a
moderately
tolerant
air
felt
called
upon
at
last
to
interfere
we
d
best
get
on
he
remarked
pointing
to
two
figures
in
the
distance
or
they
ll
say
we
ve
cut
hamel
smote
his
ball
far
and
true
on
a
more
moderate
scale
she
followed
his
example
they
descended
the
steps
together
isn
t
going
to
spoil
our
golf
he
whispered
smiling
as
he
touched
her
fingers
once
more
she
looked
at
him
almost
shyly
is
this
she
asked
they
walked
together
from
the
eighteenth
green
towards
the
a
curious
silence
seemed
suddenly
to
have
enveloped
them
hamel
was
conscious
of
a
strange
exhilaration
a
queer
upheaval
of
ideas
an
excitement
which
nothing
in
his
previous
life
had
yet
been
able
to
yield
him
the
wonder
of
it
amazed
him
kept
him
silent
it
was
not
until
they
reached
the
steps
indeed
that
he
spoke
on
our
way
home
he
began
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
stiffened
he
looked
at
her
surprised
she
was
standing
quite
still
her
hand
gripping
the
post
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
waiting
the
delicate
softness
had
gone
from
her
face
once
more
that
look
of
partly
veiled
suffering
was
there
suffering
mingled
with
fear
look
she
whispered
under
her
breath
look
it
is
fentolin
he
has
come
for
us
himself
he
is
there
in
the
fentolin
a
strange
little
figure
lying
back
among
the
cushions
of
the
great
daimler
raised
his
hat
and
waved
it
to
them
come
along
children
he
cried
you
see
i
am
here
to
fetch
you
myself
the
sunshine
has
tempted
me
what
a
heavenly
morning
come
and
sit
by
my
side
esther
and
fight
your
battle
all
over
again
that
is
one
of
the
joys
of
golf
isn
t
it
he
asked
turning
to
hamel
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
boring
me
is
one
of
my
bright
days
i
suppose
that
it
is
the
sunshine
and
the
warm
wind
on
the
way
here
we
passed
some
fields
i
could
swear
that
i
smelt
violets
where
are
you
going
esther
to
take
my
clubs
to
my
locker
and
pay
my
caddy
she
replied
mr
hamel
will
do
that
for
you
fentolin
declared
come
and
take
your
seat
by
my
side
and
let
us
wait
for
him
i
am
tired
of
being
she
gave
up
her
clubs
reluctantly
all
the
life
seemed
to
have
gone
from
her
face
why
didn
t
mother
come
with
you
she
asked
simply
to
tell
you
the
truth
dear
esther
he
answered
when
i
started
i
had
a
fancy
to
be
alone
i
think
in
fact
i
am
sure
that
your
mother
wanted
to
come
the
sunshine
too
was
tempting
her
perhaps
it
was
selfish
of
me
not
to
bring
her
but
then
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
forgiven
me
isn
t
there
esther
a
great
deal
she
echoed
looking
steadily
ahead
of
her
i
came
he
went
on
because
it
occurred
to
me
that
after
all
i
had
my
duties
as
your
guardian
dear
esther
i
am
not
sure
that
we
can
permit
flirtations
you
know
let
me
see
how
old
are
you
she
replied
in
a
magazine
i
was
reading
the
other
day
he
continued
i
was
interested
to
observe
that
the
modern
idea
as
regards
marriage
is
a
changed
one
a
woman
they
say
should
not
marry
until
she
is
or
a
very
excellent
idea
i
think
we
agree
do
we
not
on
that
esther
i
don
t
know
she
replied
i
have
never
thought
about
the
then
he
went
on
we
will
make
up
our
minds
to
agree
or
let
us
say
a
very
excellent
age
a
girl
should
know
her
own
mind
by
then
and
meanwhile
dear
esther
would
it
be
wise
i
wonder
to
see
a
little
less
of
our
friend
hamel
he
leaves
us
i
think
he
is
very
obstinate
about
that
if
he
were
staying
still
in
the
house
well
it
might
be
different
but
if
he
persists
in
leaving
us
you
will
not
forget
dear
that
association
with
a
guest
is
one
thing
association
with
a
young
man
living
out
of
the
house
is
another
a
great
deal
less
of
hamel
i
think
that
we
must
she
made
no
reply
whatever
hamel
was
coming
now
towards
them
really
a
very
personable
young
man
fentolin
remarked
studying
him
through
his
eyeglass
is
it
my
fancy
i
wonder
as
an
observant
person
or
is
he
just
a
little
just
a
little
taken
with
you
esther
a
pity
if
it
is
so
a
great
she
said
nothing
but
her
hand
which
rested
upon
the
rug
was
trembling
a
little
if
you
have
an
opportunity
fentolin
suggested
dropping
his
voice
you
might
very
delicately
you
know
girls
are
so
clever
at
that
sort
of
thing
convey
my
views
to
hamel
as
regards
his
leaving
us
and
its
effect
upon
your
companionship
you
understand
me
i
am
sure
for
the
first
time
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
i
understand
she
said
that
you
have
some
particular
reason
for
not
wishing
hamel
to
leave
david
s
he
smiled
benignly
you
do
my
hospitable
impulses
full
justice
dear
esther
he
declared
sometimes
i
think
that
you
understand
me
almost
as
well
as
your
dear
mother
if
by
any
chance
hamel
should
change
his
mind
as
to
taking
up
his
residence
at
the
tower
i
think
you
would
not
find
me
in
any
sense
of
the
word
an
obdurate
or
exacting
guardian
come
along
hamel
that
seat
opposite
to
us
is
quite
comfortable
you
see
i
resign
myself
to
the
inevitable
i
have
come
to
fetch
golfers
home
to
luncheon
and
i
compose
myself
to
listen
which
of
you
will
begin
the
epic
of
missed
putts
and
brassey
shots
which
failed
by
a
foot
to
carry
chapter
xxiv
hamel
sat
alone
upon
the
terrace
his
afternoon
coffee
on
a
small
table
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
black
speck
at
the
end
of
the
level
roadway
which
led
to
the
tower
only
a
few
minutes
before
fentolin
in
his
little
carriage
had
shot
out
from
the
passage
beneath
the
terrace
on
his
way
to
the
tower
behind
him
came
meekins
bending
over
his
bicycle
hamel
watched
them
both
with
thoughtful
eyes
there
were
several
little
incidents
in
connection
with
their
expedition
which
he
scarcely
understood
then
there
came
at
last
the
sound
for
which
he
had
been
listening
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
along
the
terraced
way
hamel
turned
quickly
around
half
rising
to
his
feet
and
concealing
his
disappointment
with
difficulty
it
was
seymour
fentolin
who
stood
there
a
little
dog
under
each
arm
a
large
hat
gay
with
flowers
upon
her
head
she
wore
patent
shoes
with
high
heels
and
white
silk
stockings
she
had
indeed
the
air
of
being
dressed
for
luncheon
at
a
fashionable
restaurant
as
she
stooped
to
set
the
dogs
down
a
strong
waft
of
perfume
was
shaken
from
her
clothes
are
you
entirely
deserted
hamel
she
asked
i
am
he
replied
miss
esther
went
i
think
to
look
for
you
my
host
he
added
pointing
to
the
black
speck
in
the
distance
begged
me
to
defer
my
occupation
of
the
tower
for
an
hour
or
so
and
has
gone
down
there
to
collect
some
of
his
her
eyes
followed
his
outstretched
hand
she
seemed
to
him
to
shiver
for
a
moment
you
really
mean
then
that
you
are
going
to
leave
us
she
asked
accepting
the
chair
which
he
had
drawn
up
close
to
his
he
smiled
well
i
scarcely
came
on
a
visit
to
david
s
hall
did
i
he
reminded
her
it
has
been
delightfully
hospitable
of
fentolin
to
have
insisted
upon
my
staying
on
here
for
these
few
days
but
i
could
not
possibly
inflict
myself
upon
you
all
for
an
unlimited
fentolin
sat
quite
still
for
a
time
in
absolute
repose
if
one
could
forget
her
mass
of
unnaturally
golden
hair
the
forced
and
constant
smile
the
too
liberal
use
of
rouge
and
powder
the
nervous
motions
of
her
head
it
was
easily
to
be
realised
that
there
were
still
neglected
attractions
about
her
face
and
figure
only
in
these
moments
of
repose
an
intense
and
ageing
weariness
seemed
to
have
crept
into
her
eyes
and
face
it
was
as
though
she
had
dropped
the
mask
of
incessant
gaiety
and
permitted
a
glimpse
of
her
real
self
to
steal
to
the
surface
mr
hamel
she
said
quietly
i
dare
say
that
even
during
these
few
days
you
have
realised
that
fentolin
is
a
very
peculiar
i
have
certainly
observed
eccentricities
hamel
assented
my
life
and
the
lives
of
my
two
children
she
went
on
is
devoted
to
the
task
of
ministering
to
his
isn
t
that
rather
a
heavy
sacrifice
he
asked
seymour
fentolin
looked
down
the
long
narrow
way
along
which
fentolin
had
passed
he
was
out
of
sight
now
inside
the
tower
somehow
or
other
the
thought
seemed
to
give
her
courage
and
dignity
she
spoke
differently
without
nervousness
or
hurry
to
you
hamel
she
said
it
may
seem
so
we
who
make
it
know
of
its
he
bowed
his
head
it
was
not
a
subject
for
him
to
discuss
with
her
mr
fentolin
has
whims
she
went
on
violent
whims
we
all
try
to
humour
him
he
has
his
own
ideas
about
gerald
s
bringing
up
i
do
not
agree
with
them
but
we
submit
esther
too
suffers
perhaps
to
a
less
extent
as
for
me
her
voice
broke
a
little
mr
fentolin
likes
people
around
him
who
are
always
cheerful
he
prefers
even
a
certain
style
of
dress
i
too
have
to
do
my
little
hamel
s
face
grew
darker
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
he
demanded
that
fentolin
is
a
tyrant
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
there
are
reasons
she
declared
why
i
can
not
discuss
that
with
you
he
has
these
strong
fancies
and
it
is
our
task
in
life
to
humour
them
he
has
one
now
with
regard
to
the
tower
with
regard
to
you
you
are
of
course
your
own
master
you
can
do
as
you
choose
and
you
will
do
as
you
choose
neither
i
nor
my
children
have
any
claim
upon
your
consideration
but
hamel
you
have
been
so
kind
that
i
feel
moved
to
tell
you
this
it
would
make
it
very
much
easier
for
all
of
us
if
you
would
give
up
this
scheme
of
yours
if
you
would
stay
on
here
instead
of
going
to
reside
at
the
hamel
threw
away
his
cigarette
he
was
deeply
interested
mrs
fentolin
he
said
i
am
glad
to
have
you
speak
so
plainly
let
me
answer
you
in
the
same
spirit
i
am
leaving
this
house
mainly
because
i
have
conceived
certain
suspicions
with
regard
to
fentolin
i
do
not
like
him
i
do
not
trust
him
i
do
not
believe
in
him
therefore
i
mean
to
remove
myself
from
the
burden
of
his
hospitality
there
are
reasons
he
went
on
why
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
altogether
there
are
certain
investigations
which
i
wish
to
make
that
is
why
i
have
decided
to
go
to
the
miles
was
right
then
she
cried
suddenly
you
are
here
to
spy
upon
him
he
turned
towards
her
swiftly
to
spy
upon
him
fentolin
for
what
reason
why
is
he
a
criminal
then
she
opened
her
lips
and
closed
them
again
there
was
a
slight
frown
upon
her
forehead
it
was
obvious
that
the
word
had
unintentionally
escaped
her
i
only
know
what
it
is
that
he
called
you
what
he
suspects
you
of
being
she
explained
mr
fentolin
is
very
clever
and
he
is
generally
at
work
upon
something
we
do
not
enquire
into
the
purpose
of
his
labours
the
only
thing
i
know
is
that
he
suspects
you
of
wanting
to
steal
one
of
his
secrets
but
what
secrets
has
he
hamel
demanded
is
he
an
inventor
you
ask
me
idle
questions
she
sighed
we
have
gone
perhaps
a
little
further
than
i
intended
i
came
to
plead
with
you
for
all
our
sakes
if
i
could
to
make
things
more
comfortable
by
remaining
here
instead
of
insisting
upon
your
claim
to
the
mrs
fentolin
hamel
said
firmly
i
like
to
do
what
i
can
to
please
and
benefit
my
friends
especially
those
who
have
been
kind
to
me
i
will
be
quite
frank
with
you
there
is
nothing
you
could
ask
me
which
i
would
not
do
for
your
daughter
s
sake
if
i
were
convinced
that
it
was
for
her
seymour
fentolin
seemed
to
be
trembling
a
little
her
hands
were
crossed
upon
her
bosom
you
have
known
her
for
so
short
a
time
she
murmured
hamel
smiled
confidently
i
will
not
weary
you
he
said
with
the
usual
trite
remarks
i
will
simply
tell
you
that
the
time
has
been
long
enough
i
love
your
fentolin
sat
quite
still
only
in
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
seawards
there
was
the
light
of
something
new
as
though
some
new
thought
was
stirring
in
her
brain
her
lips
moved
although
the
sound
which
came
was
almost
inaudible
why
not
she
murmured
as
though
arguing
with
some
unseen
critic
of
her
thoughts
why
not
i
am
not
a
rich
man
hamel
went
on
but
i
am
fairly
well
off
i
could
afford
to
be
married
at
once
and
i
should
like
she
turned
suddenly
upon
him
and
gripped
his
wrist
listen
she
interrupted
you
are
a
traveller
are
you
not
you
have
been
to
distant
countries
where
white
people
go
seldom
inaccessible
countries
where
even
the
arm
of
the
law
seldom
reaches
couldn
t
you
take
her
away
there
take
her
right
away
travel
so
fast
that
nothing
could
catch
you
and
hide
hide
for
a
little
time
hamel
stared
at
his
companion
for
a
moment
blankly
her
attitude
was
so
unexpected
her
questioning
so
fierce
my
dear
fentolin
he
began
she
suddenly
relaxed
her
grip
of
his
arm
something
of
the
old
hopelessness
was
settling
down
upon
her
face
her
hands
fell
into
her
lap
no
she
interrupted
i
forgot
i
mustn
t
talk
like
that
she
too
is
part
of
the
part
of
the
sacrifice
hamel
repeated
frowning
is
she
indeed
i
don
t
know
what
sacrifice
you
mean
but
esther
is
the
girl
whom
sooner
or
later
somehow
or
other
i
am
going
to
make
my
wife
and
when
she
is
my
wife
i
shall
see
to
it
that
she
isn
t
afraid
of
miles
fentolin
or
of
any
other
man
a
gleam
of
hopefulness
shone
through
the
stony
misery
of
the
woman
s
face
does
esther
care
she
asked
softly
how
can
i
tell
i
can
only
hope
so
if
she
doesn
t
yet
she
shall
some
day
i
suppose
he
added
with
a
sigh
it
is
rather
too
soon
yet
to
expect
that
she
should
if
it
is
necessary
i
can
fentolin
s
eyes
were
once
more
fixed
upon
the
tower
the
sun
had
caught
the
top
of
the
telephone
wire
and
played
around
it
till
it
seemed
like
a
long
thin
shaft
of
silver
if
you
go
down
there
she
said
esther
will
not
be
allowed
to
see
you
at
all
fentolin
has
decided
to
take
it
as
a
personal
affront
you
will
be
ostracised
from
shall
i
he
answered
well
it
won
t
be
for
long
at
any
rate
and
as
to
not
seeing
esther
you
must
remember
that
i
come
from
outside
this
little
domain
and
i
see
nothing
more
in
fentolin
than
a
mischievous
tyrannical
old
invalid
who
is
fortunately
prevented
by
his
infirmities
from
doing
as
much
mischief
as
he
might
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
or
of
the
bully
he
takes
about
with
him
and
i
am
going
to
see
your
daughter
somehow
or
other
and
i
am
going
to
marry
her
before
very
she
thrust
out
her
hand
suddenly
and
grasped
his
the
fingers
were
very
thin
almost
bony
and
covered
with
rings
their
grip
was
feverish
and
he
felt
them
tremble
you
are
a
brave
man
hamel
she
declared
speaking
in
a
low
quick
undertone
perhaps
you
are
right
the
shadow
isn
t
over
your
head
you
haven
t
lived
in
the
terror
of
it
you
may
find
a
way
god
grant
it
she
wrung
his
fingers
and
rose
to
her
feet
her
voice
suddenly
changed
into
another
key
hamel
knew
instinctively
that
she
wished
him
to
understand
that
their
conversation
was
over
she
cried
come
along
dear
we
must
have
our
walk
come
along
koto
come
along
little
hamel
strolled
down
the
terrace
steps
and
wandered
for
a
time
in
the
gardens
behind
the
house
here
in
the
shelter
of
the
great
building
he
found
himself
suddenly
in
an
atmosphere
of
springtime
there
were
beds
of
crocuses
and
hyacinths
fragrant
clumps
of
violets
borders
of
snowdrops
masses
of
primroses
and
early
anemones
he
slowly
climbed
one
or
two
steep
paths
until
he
reached
a
sort
of
plateau
level
with
the
top
of
the
house
the
flowers
here
grew
more
sparsely
the
track
of
the
salt
wind
lay
like
a
withering
band
across
the
the
garden
below
was
like
a
little
oasis
of
colour
and
perfume
arrived
at
the
bordering
red
brick
wall
he
turned
around
and
looked
along
the
narrow
road
which
led
to
the
sea
there
was
no
sign
of
fentolin
s
return
then
to
his
left
he
saw
a
gate
open
and
heard
the
clamour
of
dogs
esther
appeared
walking
swiftly
towards
the
little
stretch
of
road
which
led
to
the
village
he
hurried
after
her
unsociable
person
he
exclaimed
as
he
caught
her
up
didn
t
you
know
that
i
was
longing
for
a
walk
how
should
i
read
your
thoughts
she
answered
besides
a
few
minutes
ago
i
saw
you
on
the
terrace
talking
to
mother
i
am
only
going
as
far
as
the
may
i
come
he
asked
i
have
business
there
she
laughed
there
are
nine
cottages
three
farmhouses
and
a
general
shop
in
david
s
she
remarked
also
about
fifteen
fishermen
s
cottages
dotted
about
the
marsh
your
business
i
presume
is
with
the
general
shop
he
shook
his
head
falling
into
step
with
her
what
i
want
he
explained
is
to
find
a
woman
to
come
in
and
look
after
me
at
the
tower
your
servant
who
valets
me
has
given
me
two
something
of
the
lightness
faded
from
her
face
so
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
leave
us
she
asked
slowly
mother
wasn
t
able
to
persuade
you
to
stay
he
shook
his
head
she
was
very
kind
he
said
but
there
are
really
grave
reasons
why
i
feel
that
i
must
not
accept
fentolin
s
hospitality
any
longer
i
had
he
went
on
a
very
interesting
talk
with
your
she
turned
quickly
towards
him
the
slightest
possible
tinge
of
additional
colour
was
in
her
cheeks
she
was
walking
on
the
top
of
a
green
bank
with
the
wind
blowing
her
skirts
around
her
the
turn
of
her
head
was
a
little
diffident
almost
shy
her
eyes
were
asking
him
questions
at
that
moment
she
seemed
to
him
with
her
slim
body
her
gently
parted
lips
and
soft
tremulous
eyes
almost
like
a
child
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
i
told
your
mother
he
continued
all
that
i
have
told
you
and
more
i
told
her
dear
that
i
cared
for
you
that
i
wanted
you
to
be
my
she
was
caught
in
a
little
gust
of
wind
both
her
hands
went
up
to
her
hat
her
face
was
hidden
she
stepped
down
from
the
bank
you
shouldn
t
have
done
that
she
said
quietly
why
not
he
demanded
it
was
the
he
stooped
forward
intent
upon
looking
into
her
face
the
mystic
softness
was
still
in
her
eyes
but
her
general
expression
was
inscrutable
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
fear
there
what
did
mother
say
she
whispered
nothing
discouraging
he
replied
i
don
t
think
she
minded
at
all
i
have
decided
if
you
give
me
permission
to
go
and
talk
to
fentolin
this
she
shook
her
head
very
emphatically
don
t
she
implored
don
t
don
t
give
him
another
whip
to
lash
us
with
keep
silent
let
me
just
have
the
memory
for
a
few
days
all
to
her
words
came
to
him
like
numb
things
there
was
little
expression
in
them
and
yet
he
felt
that
somehow
they
meant
so
much
esther
dear
he
said
i
shall
do
just
as
you
ask
me
at
the
same
time
please
listen
i
think
that
you
are
all
absurdly
frightened
of
fentolin
living
here
alone
with
him
you
have
all
grown
under
his
dominance
to
an
unreasonable
extent
because
of
his
horrible
infirmity
you
have
let
yourselves
become
his
slaves
there
are
limits
to
this
sort
of
thing
esther
i
come
here
as
a
stranger
and
i
see
nothing
more
in
fentolin
than
a
very
selfish
irritable
domineering
and
capricious
old
man
humour
him
by
all
means
i
am
willing
to
do
the
same
myself
but
when
it
comes
to
the
great
things
in
life
neither
he
nor
any
living
person
is
going
to
keep
from
me
the
woman
i
she
walked
by
his
side
in
silence
her
breath
was
coming
a
little
quicker
her
fingers
lay
passive
in
his
then
for
a
moment
he
felt
the
grip
of
them
almost
burn
into
his
flesh
still
she
said
nothing
i
want
your
permission
dear
he
went
on
to
go
to
him
i
suppose
he
calls
himself
your
guardian
if
he
says
no
you
are
of
age
i
just
want
you
to
believe
that
i
am
strong
enough
to
put
my
arms
around
you
and
to
carry
you
away
to
my
own
world
and
keep
you
there
although
an
army
of
fentolin
s
creatures
followed
she
turned
and
he
saw
the
great
transformation
her
face
was
brilliant
her
eyes
shone
with
wonderful
things
please
she
begged
will
you
say
or
do
nothing
at
all
for
a
little
time
until
i
tell
you
when
i
want
just
a
few
days
peace
you
have
said
such
beautiful
things
to
me
that
i
want
them
to
lie
there
in
my
thoughts
in
my
heart
undisturbed
for
just
a
little
time
you
see
we
are
at
the
village
now
i
am
going
to
call
at
this
third
cottage
while
i
am
inside
you
can
go
and
make
what
enquiries
you
like
come
and
knock
at
the
door
for
me
when
you
are
and
we
will
walk
back
together
we
will
walk
back
together
she
promised
him
i
will
take
you
home
another
way
i
will
take
you
over
what
they
call
the
common
and
come
down
behind
the
hall
into
the
she
dismissed
him
with
a
little
smile
he
strolled
along
the
village
street
and
plunged
into
the
mysterious
recesses
of
the
one
tiny
shop
chapter
xxv
hamel
met
kinsley
shortly
before
one
o
clock
the
following
afternoon
in
the
lounge
of
the
royal
hotel
at
norwich
you
got
my
wire
then
the
latter
asked
as
he
held
out
his
hand
i
had
it
sent
by
special
messenger
from
it
arrived
directly
after
breakfast
hamel
replied
it
wasn
t
the
easiest
matter
to
get
here
even
then
for
there
are
only
about
two
trains
a
day
and
i
didn
t
want
to
borrow
a
car
from
quite
right
kinsley
agreed
i
wanted
you
to
come
absolutely
on
your
own
let
s
get
into
the
and
have
some
lunch
now
i
want
to
catch
the
afternoon
train
back
to
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
ve
come
all
the
way
down
here
to
talk
to
me
for
half
an
hour
or
so
hamel
demanded
as
they
took
their
places
at
a
table
all
the
way
from
town
kinsley
assented
and
up
to
the
eyes
in
work
we
are
too
dick
what
do
you
think
of
miles
fentolin
hanged
if
i
know
hamel
answered
with
a
sigh
nothing
definite
to
tell
us
then
nothing
what
about
john
dunster
he
left
yesterday
morning
hamel
said
i
saw
him
go
he
looked
very
shaky
i
understood
that
fentolin
sent
him
to
did
fentolin
know
that
there
was
an
enquiry
on
foot
about
this
man
s
disappearance
kinsley
asked
certainly
i
heard
lord
saxthorpe
tell
him
that
the
police
had
received
orders
to
scour
the
country
for
him
and
that
they
were
coming
to
david
s
kinsley
for
a
moment
was
singularly
and
eloquently
profane
that
s
why
fentolin
let
him
go
then
if
saxthorpe
had
only
held
his
tongue
or
if
those
infernal
police
hadn
t
got
chattering
with
the
magistrates
we
might
have
made
a
coup
as
it
is
the
game
s
up
dunster
left
for
yarmouth
you
say
yesterday
morning
i
saw
him
go
myself
he
looked
very
shaky
and
ill
but
he
was
able
to
smoke
a
big
cigar
and
walk
leaning
on
the
doctor
s
i
don
t
doubt
kinsley
remarked
but
that
you
saw
what
you
say
you
saw
at
the
same
time
you
may
be
surprised
to
hear
that
dunster
has
disappeared
disappeared
again
hamel
muttered
it
looks
very
much
kinsley
continued
as
though
your
friend
miles
fentolin
has
been
playing
with
him
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
he
has
been
obliged
to
turn
him
out
of
one
and
he
has
simply
transferred
him
to
hamel
looked
doubtful
mr
dunster
left
quite
alone
in
the
car
he
said
he
was
on
his
guard
too
for
fentolin
and
he
had
had
words
i
really
can
t
see
how
it
was
possible
for
him
to
have
got
into
any
more
where
is
he
then
kinsley
demanded
come
i
will
let
you
a
little
further
into
our
confidence
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
carries
with
him
a
written
message
which
is
practically
the
only
chance
we
have
of
avoiding
disaster
during
the
next
few
days
that
written
message
is
addressed
to
the
delegates
at
the
hague
who
are
now
sitting
nothing
had
been
heard
of
dunster
or
the
document
he
carries
no
word
has
come
from
him
of
any
sort
since
he
left
david
s
have
you
tried
to
trace
him
from
there
hamel
asked
trace
him
kinsley
repeated
by
heavens
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
dick
the
immense
the
extraordinary
importance
of
this
man
to
us
the
cleverest
detective
in
england
spent
yesterday
under
your
nose
at
david
s
hall
there
are
a
dozen
others
working
upon
the
job
as
hard
as
they
can
all
the
reports
confirm
what
you
say
that
dunster
left
david
s
hall
at
nine
yesterday
morning
and
he
certainly
arrived
in
yarmouth
at
a
little
before
twelve
from
there
he
seems
however
to
have
completely
disappeared
the
car
went
back
to
david
s
hall
empty
the
man
only
stayed
long
enough
in
yarmouth
in
fact
to
have
his
dinner
we
can
not
find
a
single
smack
owner
who
was
approached
in
any
way
for
the
hire
of
a
boat
yarmouth
has
been
ransacked
in
vain
he
certainly
has
not
arrived
at
the
hague
or
we
should
have
heard
news
at
once
as
a
last
resource
i
ran
down
here
to
see
you
on
the
chance
of
your
having
picked
up
any
hamel
shook
his
head
you
seem
to
know
a
good
deal
more
than
i
do
already
he
said
what
do
you
think
of
fentolin
you
have
stayed
in
his
house
you
have
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
so
far
as
my
impressions
go
hamel
replied
everything
which
you
have
suggested
might
very
well
be
true
i
think
that
either
out
of
sheer
love
of
mischief
or
from
some
subtler
motive
he
is
capable
of
anything
every
one
in
the
place
except
one
poor
woman
seems
to
look
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
supernatural
being
he
gives
money
away
to
worthless
people
with
both
hands
yet
i
share
your
opinion
of
him
i
believe
that
he
is
a
creature
without
conscience
or
morals
i
have
sat
at
his
table
and
shivered
when
he
has
are
you
staying
at
david
s
hall
now
i
left
where
are
you
now
then
i
am
at
david
s
tower
the
little
place
i
told
you
of
that
belonged
to
my
father
but
i
don
t
know
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
stop
there
fentolin
for
some
reason
or
other
very
much
resented
my
leaving
the
hall
and
was
very
annoyed
at
my
insisting
upon
claiming
the
tower
when
i
went
down
to
the
village
to
get
some
one
to
come
up
and
look
after
me
there
wasn
t
a
woman
there
who
would
come
it
didn
t
matter
what
i
offered
they
were
all
the
same
they
all
muttered
some
excuse
or
other
and
seemed
only
anxious
to
show
me
out
at
the
village
shop
they
seemed
to
hate
to
serve
me
with
anything
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
a
packet
of
tobacco
yesterday
afternoon
you
would
really
think
that
i
was
the
most
unpopular
person
who
ever
lived
and
it
can
only
be
because
of
fentolin
s
mr
fentolin
evidently
doesn
t
like
to
have
you
in
the
locality
kinsley
remarked
thoughtfully
he
was
all
right
so
long
as
i
was
at
david
s
hall
hamel
observed
what
s
this
little
place
like
david
s
tower
you
call
it
kinsley
asked
just
a
little
stone
building
actually
on
the
beach
hamel
explained
there
is
a
large
shed
which
fentolin
keeps
locked
up
and
the
habitable
portion
consists
just
of
a
bedroom
and
from
what
i
can
see
fentolin
has
been
making
a
sort
of
hobby
of
the
place
there
is
telephonic
communication
with
the
house
and
he
seems
to
have
used
the
as
a
sort
of
studio
he
paints
sea
pictures
and
really
paints
them
very
a
man
came
into
the
made
some
enquiry
of
the
waiter
and
went
out
again
hamel
stared
at
him
in
a
puzzled
manner
for
the
moment
he
could
only
remember
that
the
face
was
familiar
then
he
suddenly
gave
vent
to
a
little
exclamation
any
one
would
think
that
i
had
been
followed
he
remarked
the
man
who
has
just
looked
into
the
room
is
one
of
fentolin
s
parasites
or
bodyguards
or
whatever
you
call
you
probably
have
kinsley
agreed
what
post
does
he
hold
in
the
household
i
have
no
idea
hamel
replied
i
saw
him
the
first
day
i
arrived
and
not
since
sort
of
secretary
i
should
he
is
a
fellow
anyway
kinsley
muttered
look
out
dick
here
he
comes
back
ryan
approached
the
table
a
little
diffidently
i
hope
you
will
forgive
the
liberty
sir
he
said
to
hamel
you
remember
me
i
trust
ryan
i
am
the
librarian
at
david
s
hamel
nodded
i
thought
i
d
seen
you
i
was
wondering
the
man
continued
whether
you
had
a
car
of
fentolin
s
in
norwich
and
if
so
whether
i
might
beg
a
seat
back
in
case
you
were
returning
before
the
five
o
clock
train
i
came
in
early
this
morning
to
go
through
some
manuscripts
at
a
bookseller
s
here
and
i
have
unfortunately
missed
the
train
hamel
shook
his
head
i
came
in
by
train
myself
or
i
would
have
given
you
a
lift
back
with
pleasure
he
said
ryan
expressed
his
thanks
briefly
and
left
the
room
kinsley
watched
him
from
over
the
top
of
a
newspaper
so
that
is
one
of
fentolin
s
creatures
too
he
remarked
keeping
his
eye
on
you
in
norwich
eh
tell
me
dick
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
rest
of
fentolin
s
household
and
exactly
of
whom
does
it
consist
there
is
his
hamel
replied
mrs
seymour
fentolin
she
is
a
strange
woman
who
seems
to
stand
in
mortal
fear
of
fentolin
she
is
always
overdressed
and
never
natural
but
it
seems
to
me
that
nearly
everything
she
does
is
done
to
suit
his
whims
or
at
his
kinsley
nodded
thoughtfully
i
remember
seymour
fentolin
he
said
a
really
fine
fellow
he
was
well
who
else
just
the
nephew
and
niece
the
boy
is
half
sullen
half
discontented
yet
he
too
seems
to
obey
his
uncle
blindly
the
three
of
them
seem
to
be
his
slaves
it
s
a
thing
you
can
t
live
in
the
house
without
it
seems
to
be
a
cheerful
sort
of
household
kinsley
observed
you
read
the
papers
i
suppose
dick
he
asked
after
a
moment
s
pause
on
and
off
the
last
few
days
i
seem
to
have
been
busy
doing
all
sorts
of
well
i
ll
tell
you
something
kinsley
continued
the
whole
of
our
available
fleet
is
engaged
in
carrying
out
what
they
call
a
demonstration
in
the
north
sea
they
have
patrol
boats
out
in
every
direction
and
only
the
short
distance
wireless
signals
are
being
used
everything
of
course
is
in
code
yet
we
know
this
for
a
fact
a
good
deal
of
private
information
passing
between
the
admiral
and
his
commanders
was
known
in
germany
three
hours
after
the
signals
themselves
had
been
given
it
is
suspected
more
than
suspected
in
fact
that
these
messages
were
picked
up
by
fentolin
s
wireless
i
don
t
suppose
he
could
help
receiving
them
hamel
remarked
he
could
help
decoding
them
and
sending
them
through
to
germany
though
kinsley
retorted
grimly
the
worst
of
it
is
he
has
a
private
telephone
wire
in
his
house
to
london
if
he
isn
t
up
to
mischief
what
does
he
need
all
these
things
for
private
telegraph
line
private
telephone
private
wireless
we
have
given
the
postmaster
a
hint
to
have
the
telegraph
office
moved
down
into
the
village
but
i
don
t
know
that
that
will
help
us
so
far
as
regards
the
wireless
hamel
said
i
rather
believe
that
it
is
temporarily
dismantled
we
had
a
over
the
morning
before
yesterday
to
complain
of
his
messages
having
been
picked
up
fentolin
promised
at
once
to
put
his
installation
out
of
work
for
a
he
has
done
plenty
of
mischief
with
it
already
kinsley
groaned
however
it
was
dunster
i
came
down
to
make
enquiries
about
i
couldn
t
help
hoping
that
you
might
have
been
able
to
put
us
on
the
right
hamel
sighed
i
know
nothing
beyond
what
i
have
told
how
did
he
look
when
he
went
away
very
ill
indeed
hamel
declared
i
afterwards
saw
the
nurse
who
had
been
attending
him
and
she
admitted
that
he
was
not
fit
to
travel
i
should
say
the
probabilities
are
that
he
is
laid
up
again
did
you
actually
speak
to
him
just
a
word
or
and
you
saw
him
go
off
in
the
car
gerald
fentolin
and
i
both
saw
him
and
wished
him
kinsley
glanced
at
the
clock
and
rose
to
his
feet
walk
down
to
the
station
with
me
he
suggested
i
needn
t
tell
you
i
am
sure
he
went
on
as
they
left
the
hotel
a
few
minutes
later
that
if
anything
does
turn
up
or
if
you
get
the
glimmering
of
an
idea
you
ll
let
me
know
we
ve
a
small
army
looking
for
the
fellow
but
it
does
seem
as
though
he
had
disappeared
off
the
face
of
the
earth
if
he
doesn
t
turn
up
before
the
end
of
the
conference
we
are
tell
me
hamel
asked
after
they
had
walked
for
some
distance
in
silence
exactly
why
is
our
fleet
demonstrating
to
such
an
extent
that
conference
i
have
spoken
of
kinsley
replied
which
is
being
held
at
the
hague
is
being
held
we
know
purposely
to
discuss
certain
matters
in
which
we
are
interested
it
is
meeting
for
their
discussion
without
any
invitation
having
been
sent
to
this
country
there
is
only
one
reply
possible
to
such
a
course
it
is
there
in
the
north
sea
but
unfortunately
kinsley
paused
his
tone
and
his
expression
had
alike
become
gloomier
go
on
hamel
begged
our
reply
after
all
is
a
miserable
affair
kinsley
concluded
you
remember
the
outcry
over
the
withdrawal
of
our
mediterranean
fleet
now
you
see
its
sequel
we
haven
t
a
ship
worth
a
snap
of
the
fingers
from
gibraltar
to
suez
if
france
deserts
us
it
s
to
malta
to
egypt
to
india
it
s
the
disruption
of
the
british
empire
and
all
this
he
wound
up
as
he
paused
before
taking
his
seat
in
the
railway
carriage
all
this
might
even
now
be
avoided
if
only
we
could
lay
our
hands
upon
the
message
which
that
man
dunster
was
bringing
from
new
york
chapter
xxvi
once
more
hamel
descended
from
the
little
train
and
turning
away
from
david
s
hall
made
his
way
across
the
marshes
seawards
the
sunshine
of
the
last
few
days
had
departed
the
twilight
was
made
gloomy
by
a
floating
veil
of
white
mist
which
hung
about
in
wet
patches
hamel
turned
up
his
coat
collar
as
he
walked
and
shivered
a
little
the
thought
of
his
solitary
night
and
uncomfortable
surroundings
after
all
the
luxury
of
david
s
hall
was
scarcely
inspiring
yet
on
the
whole
he
was
splendidly
cheerful
the
glamour
of
a
host
of
new
sensations
was
upon
him
there
was
a
new
love
of
living
in
his
heart
he
forgot
the
cold
east
wind
which
blew
in
his
face
bringing
with
it
little
puffs
of
damp
grey
mist
he
forgot
the
cheerlessness
which
he
was
about
to
face
the
lonely
night
before
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
woman
reigned
in
his
thoughts
it
was
not
until
he
actually
reached
the
very
side
of
the
tower
that
he
came
back
to
earth
as
he
opened
the
door
he
found
a
surprise
in
store
for
him
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
smoke
was
ascending
from
the
kitchen
chimney
the
little
round
table
was
laid
with
a
white
cloth
there
was
a
faint
odour
of
cooking
from
the
back
premises
his
lamp
was
lit
there
were
logs
hissing
and
crackling
upon
the
fire
as
he
stood
there
looking
wonderingly
about
him
the
door
from
the
back
was
opened
hannah
cox
came
quietly
into
the
room
what
time
would
you
like
your
dinner
sir
she
enquired
hamel
stared
at
her
why
are
you
going
to
keep
house
for
me
cox
he
asked
if
you
please
sir
i
heard
that
you
had
been
in
the
village
looking
for
some
one
i
am
sorry
that
i
was
away
there
is
no
one
else
who
would
come
to
so
i
discovered
he
remarked
a
little
grimly
no
one
else
she
went
on
would
come
to
you
because
of
fentolin
he
does
not
wish
to
have
you
here
they
love
him
so
much
in
the
village
that
he
had
only
to
breathe
the
word
it
was
yet
you
are
here
he
reminded
her
i
do
not
count
she
answered
i
am
outside
all
these
hamel
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
well
i
am
glad
you
could
come
anyhow
if
you
have
something
for
dinner
i
should
like
it
in
about
half
an
he
climbed
the
narrow
stairs
which
led
to
his
bedroom
to
his
surprise
there
were
many
things
there
for
his
comfort
which
he
had
forgotten
to
order
clean
towels
even
a
curtain
upon
the
window
where
did
you
get
all
the
linen
from
cox
he
asked
her
when
he
descended
the
room
was
almost
empty
yesterday
and
i
forgot
nearly
all
the
things
i
meant
to
bring
home
from
mrs
seymour
fentolin
sent
down
a
hamper
for
you
the
woman
replied
with
a
message
from
fentolin
he
said
that
nothing
among
the
oddments
left
by
your
father
had
been
preserved
but
that
you
were
welcome
to
anything
you
desired
if
you
would
let
them
know
at
the
it
is
very
kind
of
both
of
them
hamel
said
thoughtfully
the
woman
stood
still
for
a
moment
looking
at
him
then
she
drew
a
step
nearer
has
fentolin
given
you
the
key
of
the
shed
she
asked
very
quietly
hamel
shook
his
head
we
don
t
need
the
place
do
we
he
did
not
give
you
the
key
she
persisted
mr
fentolin
said
that
he
had
some
things
in
there
which
he
wished
to
keep
locked
up
he
explained
she
remained
thoughtful
for
several
moments
then
she
turned
away
no
she
said
it
was
not
likely
he
would
not
give
you
that
key
hamel
dined
simply
but
comfortably
cox
cleared
away
the
things
brought
him
his
coffee
and
appeared
a
few
minutes
later
her
shawl
wrapped
around
her
ready
for
departure
i
shall
be
here
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
sir
she
announced
hamel
was
a
little
startled
he
withdrew
the
pip
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
her
why
of
course
he
remarked
i
d
forgotten
there
is
no
place
for
you
to
stay
i
shall
go
back
to
my
brother
she
said
hamel
put
some
money
upon
the
table
please
get
anything
that
is
necessary
he
directed
i
shall
leave
you
to
do
the
housekeeping
for
a
few
shall
you
be
staying
here
long
sir
she
asked
i
am
not
sure
he
replied
i
do
not
suppose
she
said
that
you
will
stay
for
very
long
i
shall
get
only
the
things
that
you
require
from
day
to
day
good
night
she
left
the
room
hamel
looked
after
her
for
a
moment
with
a
frown
in
some
indescribable
way
the
woman
half
impressed
half
irritated
him
she
had
always
the
air
of
keeping
something
in
the
background
he
followed
her
out
on
to
the
little
ridge
of
beach
a
few
minutes
after
she
had
left
the
mist
was
still
drifting
about
only
a
few
yards
away
the
sea
rolled
in
filling
the
air
with
dull
thunder
the
marshland
was
half
obscured
david
s
hall
was
invisible
but
like
lanterns
in
an
empty
space
he
saw
the
line
of
lights
from
the
great
house
gleam
through
the
obscurity
there
was
no
sound
save
the
sound
of
the
sea
he
shivered
slightly
it
was
like
an
empty
land
this
then
moved
by
some
instinct
of
curiosity
he
made
his
way
round
to
the
closed
door
of
the
only
to
find
it
as
he
had
expected
locked
he
shook
it
slightly
without
result
then
he
strolled
round
to
the
back
entered
his
own
little
abode
by
the
kitchen
and
tried
the
other
door
which
led
into
the
it
was
not
only
locked
but
a
staple
had
been
put
in
and
it
was
fastened
with
a
padlock
of
curious
design
which
he
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
there
before
again
half
unconsciously
he
listened
and
again
he
found
the
silence
oppressive
he
went
back
to
his
room
brought
out
some
of
the
books
which
it
had
been
his
intention
to
study
and
sat
and
read
over
the
fire
at
ten
o
clock
he
went
to
bed
as
he
threw
open
his
window
before
undressing
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
sea
he
listened
intently
a
grey
pall
hung
everywhere
to
the
left
with
strange
indistinctness
almost
like
something
human
struggling
to
assert
itself
came
the
fitful
flash
from
the
light
at
the
entrance
to
the
tidal
way
once
more
he
strained
his
ears
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
heard
the
sound
of
fishermen
s
voices
he
heard
one
of
them
say
distinctly
hard
aport
dave
lad
that
s
fentolin
s
light
keep
her
out
a
bit
steady
lad
through
a
rift
in
the
mist
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
brown
sail
of
a
dangerously
near
the
land
he
watched
it
alter
its
course
slightly
and
pass
on
then
again
there
was
silence
he
undressed
slowly
and
went
to
bed
later
on
he
woke
with
a
start
and
sat
up
in
bed
listening
intently
listening
for
he
knew
not
what
except
for
the
backward
scream
of
the
pebbles
dragged
down
every
few
seconds
by
the
receding
waves
an
unbroken
silence
seemed
to
prevail
he
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
exactly
three
o
clock
he
got
out
of
bed
he
was
a
man
in
perfect
health
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
nerves
a
man
of
proved
courage
yet
he
was
conscious
that
his
pulses
were
beating
with
absurd
rapidity
a
new
feeling
seemed
to
possess
him
he
could
almost
have
declared
that
he
was
afraid
what
sound
had
awakened
him
he
had
no
idea
yet
he
seemed
to
have
a
distinct
and
absolute
conviction
that
it
had
been
a
real
sound
and
no
dream
he
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
mist
now
seemed
to
have
become
almost
a
fog
to
have
closed
in
upon
sea
and
land
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
be
seen
as
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
listening
his
face
became
moist
with
the
drifting
vapour
suddenly
upon
the
beach
he
saw
what
at
first
he
imagined
must
be
an
optical
illusion
a
long
shaft
of
light
invisible
in
itself
except
that
it
seemed
to
slightly
change
the
density
of
the
mist
he
threw
on
an
overcoat
over
his
pyjamas
thrust
on
his
slippers
and
taking
up
his
own
electric
torch
hastily
descended
the
stairs
he
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
beach
he
stood
in
the
very
place
where
the
light
had
seemed
to
be
and
looked
inland
there
was
no
sign
of
any
human
person
not
a
sound
except
the
falling
of
the
sea
upon
the
pebbly
beach
he
raised
his
voice
and
called
out
somehow
or
other
speech
seemed
to
be
a
relief
hullo
there
was
no
response
he
tried
again
is
any
one
there
still
no
answer
he
watched
the
veiled
light
from
the
harbour
appear
and
disappear
it
threw
no
shadow
of
illumination
upon
the
spot
to
which
he
had
gazed
from
his
window
one
window
at
david
s
hall
was
illuminated
the
rest
of
the
place
was
wrapped
now
in
darkness
he
walked
up
to
the
the
door
was
still
locked
there
was
no
sign
that
any
one
had
been
there
reluctantly
at
last
he
the
tower
and
made
his
way
confound
that
fellow
kinsley
he
muttered
as
he
threw
off
his
overcoat
all
his
silly
suggestions
and
melodramatic
ideas
have
given
me
a
fit
of
nerves
i
am
going
to
bed
and
i
am
going
to
sleep
that
couldn
t
have
been
a
light
i
saw
at
all
i
couldn
t
have
heard
anything
i
am
going

chapter
xxvii
hamel
awoke
to
find
his
room
filled
with
sunshine
and
a
soft
wind
blowing
in
through
the
open
window
there
was
a
pleasant
odour
of
coffee
floating
up
from
the
kitchen
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
past
eight
o
clock
the
sea
was
glittering
and
bespangled
with
sunlight
he
found
among
his
scanty
belongings
a
bathing
suit
and
wrapped
in
his
overcoat
hurried
breakfast
in
half
an
hour
cox
he
called
out
she
stood
at
the
door
watching
him
as
he
stepped
across
the
pebbles
and
plunged
in
for
a
few
moments
he
swam
then
he
turned
over
on
his
back
the
sunlight
was
gleaming
from
every
window
of
david
s
hall
he
even
fancied
that
upon
the
terrace
he
could
see
a
figure
looking
towards
him
he
turned
over
and
swam
once
more
from
her
place
in
the
doorway
cox
called
out
to
him
mind
the
dagger
rocks
sir
he
waved
his
hand
the
splendid
exhilaration
of
the
salt
water
seemed
to
give
him
unlimited
courage
he
dived
but
the
woman
s
cry
of
fear
soon
recalled
him
presently
he
swam
to
shore
and
hurried
up
the
beach
cox
with
a
sigh
of
relief
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
those
rocks
on
your
nerves
again
cox
he
asked
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
breakfast
table
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
it
s
only
us
who
live
here
sir
she
answered
who
know
how
terrible
they
are
there
s
one
it
comes
up
like
my
hand
a
long
spike
a
boat
once
struck
upon
that
and
it
s
as
though
it
d
been
sawn
through
the
i
must
have
a
look
at
them
some
day
he
declared
i
am
going
to
work
this
morning
cox
lunch
at
one
o
he
took
rugs
and
established
himself
with
a
pile
of
books
at
the
back
of
a
grassy
knoll
sheltered
from
the
wind
with
the
sea
almost
at
his
feet
he
sharpened
his
pencil
and
numbered
the
page
of
his
notebook
then
he
looked
up
towards
the
hall
garden
and
found
himself
dreaming
the
sunshine
was
delicious
and
a
gentle
optimism
seemed
to
steal
over
him
i
am
a
fool
he
murmured
to
himself
i
am
catching
some
part
of
these
people
s
folly
fentolin
is
only
an
ordinary
crotchety
invalid
with
queer
tastes
on
the
big
things
he
is
probably
like
other
men
i
shall
go
to
him
this
a
screamed
over
his
head
little
brown
sailed
came
gliding
down
the
harbourway
a
pleasant
sensuous
joyfulness
seemed
part
of
the
spirit
of
the
day
hamel
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
dry
sand
work
be
hanged
he
exclaimed
a
soft
voice
answered
him
almost
in
his
ear
a
voice
which
was
becoming
very
familiar
a
most
admirable
sentiment
my
young
friend
which
you
seem
to
be
doing
your
best
to
live
up
to
not
a
line
written
i
he
sat
up
upon
his
rug
fentolin
in
his
little
carriage
was
there
by
his
side
behind
was
the
faithful
meekins
with
an
easel
under
his
arm
i
trust
that
your
first
night
in
your
new
abode
has
been
a
pleasant
one
fentolin
asked
i
slept
quite
well
thanks
hamel
replied
glad
to
see
you
re
going
to
fentolin
shook
his
head
gloomily
it
is
alas
he
declared
one
of
my
weaknesses
i
can
work
only
in
solitude
i
came
down
on
the
chance
that
the
fine
weather
might
have
tempted
you
over
to
the
golf
club
as
it
is
i
shall
i
am
awfully
sorry
hamel
said
can
t
i
go
out
of
sight
somewhere
fentolin
sighed
i
will
not
ask
your
pardon
for
my
absurd
humours
he
continued
a
little
sadly
their
existence
however
i
can
not
deny
i
will
it
seems
a
pity
for
you
to
do
that
hamel
remarked
you
see
i
might
stay
here
for
some
fentolin
s
face
darkened
he
looked
at
the
young
man
with
a
sort
of
pensive
wrath
if
the
latter
went
on
you
say
yes
to
something
i
am
going
to
ask
you
i
might
even
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
for
longer
fentolin
sat
quite
motionless
in
his
chair
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
hamel
what
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
ask
me
he
demanded
i
want
to
marry
your
fentolin
looked
at
the
young
man
in
mild
surprise
a
sudden
decision
on
your
part
hamel
he
murmured
not
at
all
hamel
assured
him
i
have
been
ten
years
looking
for
and
the
young
lady
fentolin
enquired
what
does
she
say
i
believe
sir
hamel
replied
that
she
would
be
fentolin
sighed
one
is
forced
sometimes
he
remarked
regretfully
to
realise
the
selfishness
of
our
young
people
for
many
years
one
devotes
oneself
to
providing
them
with
all
the
comforts
and
luxuries
of
life
then
in
a
single
day
they
turn
around
and
give
everything
they
have
to
give
to
a
stranger
so
you
want
to
marry
esther
if
you
she
has
a
very
moderate
she
need
have
none
at
all
hamel
replied
i
have
fentolin
glanced
towards
the
house
then
he
said
i
think
you
had
better
go
and
tell
her
so
in
which
case
i
shall
be
able
to
i
have
your
permission
then
hamel
asked
rising
to
his
feet
eagerly
negatively
fentolin
agreed
you
have
i
can
not
refuse
esther
is
of
age
the
thing
is
reasonable
i
do
not
know
whether
she
will
be
happy
with
you
or
not
a
young
man
of
your
disposition
who
declines
to
study
the
whims
of
an
unfortunate
creature
like
myself
is
scarcely
likely
to
be
possessed
of
much
sensibility
however
perhaps
your
views
as
to
a
solitary
residence
here
will
change
with
your
engagement
to
my
hamel
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
he
was
trying
to
ask
himself
why
even
in
the
midst
of
this
rush
of
anticipatory
happiness
he
should
be
conscious
of
a
certain
reluctance
to
leave
the
tower
and
fentolin
he
was
looking
longingly
towards
the
hall
fentolin
waved
him
away
go
and
make
love
he
ordered
and
leave
me
alone
we
are
both
in
pursuit
of
beauty
only
our
methods
hamel
hesitated
no
longer
but
walked
up
the
narrow
path
with
swift
buoyant
footsteps
everywhere
he
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
the
glorious
spring
sunshine
it
glittered
in
the
little
pools
and
creeks
by
his
side
it
drew
a
new
colour
from
the
marshes
the
masses
of
emerald
seaweed
the
shimmering
sands
it
flashed
in
the
long
row
of
windows
of
the
hall
as
he
drew
nearer
he
could
see
the
banks
of
yellow
crocuses
in
the
sloping
gardens
behind
there
were
odours
of
spring
in
the
air
he
ran
lightly
up
the
terrace
steps
there
was
an
drawn
into
her
favourite
corner
and
a
book
upon
the
table
but
no
sign
of
esther
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
retracing
his
steps
along
the
terrace
entered
the
house
by
the
front
door
which
stood
wide
open
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
scarcely
a
sound
about
the
place
a
great
clock
ticked
solemnly
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
not
even
a
servant
in
sight
hamel
wandered
around
at
a
loss
what
to
do
he
opened
the
door
of
the
and
looked
in
it
was
empty
he
turned
away
meaning
to
ring
a
bell
on
his
way
across
the
hall
he
paused
a
curiously
suggestive
sound
reached
him
faintly
from
the
end
of
one
of
the
passages
it
was
the
click
of
a
typewriter
hamel
stood
for
a
moment
perfectly
still
he
had
hurried
up
to
the
hall
filled
with
the
one
selfish
joy
common
to
all
mankind
he
had
had
no
thought
save
the
thought
of
seeing
esther
the
click
of
that
machine
brought
him
back
to
the
stern
realities
of
life
he
remembered
his
talk
to
kinsley
his
promise
on
the
hall
table
he
could
see
from
where
he
was
standing
the
great
headlines
which
announced
the
nation
s
anxiety
he
was
in
the
house
of
a
suspected
spy
the
click
of
the
typewriter
was
an
accompaniment
to
his
thought
he
looked
around
once
more
and
listened
then
he
made
his
way
quietly
across
the
hall
and
down
the
long
passage
at
the
end
of
which
the
room
which
fentolin
called
his
workroom
was
situated
he
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
entered
closing
it
immediately
behind
him
the
woman
who
was
typing
paused
with
her
fingers
upon
the
keys
her
eyes
met
his
coldly
without
curiosity
she
had
paused
in
her
work
but
she
took
no
other
notice
of
his
coming
has
fentolin
sent
you
here
she
asked
at
last
he
came
over
to
the
typewriter
mr
fentolin
has
not
sent
me
he
said
slowly
i
am
here
on
my
own
account
i
dare
say
you
will
think
that
i
am
a
lunatic
to
come
to
you
like
this
nevertheless
please
listen
to
her
fingers
left
the
keys
she
laid
her
hands
upon
the
table
in
front
of
her
he
drew
a
little
nearer
she
covered
over
the
sheets
of
paper
with
which
she
was
surrounded
with
a
pad
of
he
pointed
suddenly
to
them
why
do
you
do
that
he
demanded
what
is
there
in
your
work
that
you
are
afraid
i
might
see
she
answered
him
without
hesitation
these
are
private
papers
of
fentolin
s
no
one
has
any
business
to
see
them
no
one
has
any
business
to
enter
this
room
why
are
you
here
i
came
to
the
hall
to
find
miss
fentolin
he
replied
i
heard
the
click
of
your
typewriter
i
came
to
you
i
suppose
i
should
say
on
her
eyes
rested
upon
his
filled
with
a
cold
and
questioning
light
there
s
an
impression
up
in
london
hamel
went
on
that
fentolin
has
been
interfering
by
means
of
his
wireless
in
affairs
which
don
t
concern
him
and
giving
away
valuable
information
this
man
dunster
s
disappearance
is
as
yet
unexplained
i
feel
myself
justified
in
making
certain
investigations
and
among
the
first
of
them
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
exactly
the
nature
of
the
work
for
which
fentolin
finds
a
secretary
necessary
she
glanced
towards
the
bell
he
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
table
as
though
to
intercept
her
in
any
ordinary
case
he
continued
i
would
not
ask
you
to
betray
your
employer
s
confidence
as
things
are
i
think
i
am
justified
you
are
english
are
you
not
you
realise
i
suppose
that
the
country
is
on
the
brink
of
war
she
looked
at
him
from
the
depths
of
her
still
lusterless
eyes
you
must
be
a
very
foolish
person
she
remarked
if
you
expect
to
obtain
information
in
this
perhaps
i
am
he
confessed
but
my
folly
has
brought
me
to
you
and
you
can
give
me
the
information
if
you
where
is
fentolin
she
asked
down
at
the
tower
he
replied
i
left
him
there
he
sent
me
up
to
see
miss
fentolin
i
was
looking
for
her
when
the
click
of
your
typewriter
reminded
me
of
other
she
turned
composedly
back
to
her
work
i
think
she
said
that
you
had
better
go
and
find
miss
don
t
talk
nonsense
you
can
t
think
i
have
risked
giving
myself
away
to
you
for
nothing
i
mean
to
search
this
room
to
read
the
papers
which
you
are
she
glanced
around
her
a
little
contemptuously
you
are
welcome
she
assured
him
pray
they
exchanged
the
glances
of
duelists
her
plain
black
frock
was
buttoned
up
to
her
throat
her
colourless
face
seemed
set
in
exact
and
expressionless
lines
her
eyes
were
like
windows
of
glass
he
felt
only
their
scrutiny
nothing
of
the
reason
for
it
or
of
the
thoughts
which
stirred
behind
in
her
brain
there
was
nothing
about
her
attitude
which
seemed
in
any
way
threatening
yet
he
had
the
feeling
that
in
this
interview
it
was
she
who
possessed
the
upper
hand
you
are
a
foolish
person
she
said
calmly
you
are
so
foolish
that
you
are
not
in
all
probability
in
the
slightest
degree
dangerous
believe
me
ours
is
an
unequal
duel
there
is
a
bell
upon
this
table
which
has
apparently
escaped
your
notice
i
sit
with
my
finger
upon
the
button
so
i
have
only
to
press
it
and
the
servants
will
be
here
i
do
not
wish
to
press
it
i
do
not
desire
that
you
should
be
as
you
certainly
would
be
banished
from
this
he
was
immensely
puzzled
she
had
not
resented
his
strange
intrusion
she
had
accepted
it
indeed
with
curious
equanimity
her
forefinger
lingered
still
over
the
little
ivory
knob
of
the
bell
attached
to
her
desk
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
he
admitted
a
little
curtly
all
the
same
i
think
i
could
possess
myself
of
those
sheets
of
paper
you
know
before
the
bell
was
would
it
be
wise
i
wonder
then
to
ensure
their
safety
she
asked
coolly
her
finger
pressed
the
bell
he
took
a
quick
step
forward
she
held
out
her
hand
stop
she
ordered
these
sheets
will
tell
you
nothing
which
you
do
not
know
already
unless
you
are
a
fool
never
mind
the
bell
that
is
my
affair
i
am
sending
you
he
leaned
a
little
towards
her
it
wouldn
t
be
possible
to
bribe
you
i
suppose
she
shook
her
head
i
wonder
you
haven
t
tried
that
before
no
it
would
not
not
with
money
that
is
to
you
ll
tell
fentolin
i
presume
he
asked
quickly
i
have
nothing
to
tell
him
she
replied
nothing
has
happened
richards
she
went
on
as
a
servant
entered
the
room
mr
hamel
is
looking
for
miss
fentolin
will
you
see
if
you
can
find
her
the
man
s
expression
was
full
of
polite
regret
miss
fentolin
went
over
to
legh
woods
early
this
morning
sir
he
announced
she
is
staying
to
lunch
with
lady
hamel
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
the
window
in
the
far
distance
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
tower
fentolin
s
chair
had
disappeared
from
the
walk
i
am
sorry
he
said
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
i
will
hurry
there
were
more
questions
which
he
was
longing
to
ask
but
the
cold
negativeness
of
her
manner
chilled
him
she
sat
with
her
fingers
poised
over
the
keys
waiting
for
his
departure
he
turned
and
left
the
room
chapter
xxviii
fentolin
his
carriage
drawn
up
close
to
the
beach
was
painting
steadily
when
hamel
stood
once
more
by
his
side
his
eyes
moved
only
from
the
sea
to
the
canvas
he
never
turned
his
head
so
your
wooing
has
not
prospered
my
young
friend
he
remarked
gently
i
am
sorry
is
there
anything
i
can
do
your
niece
has
gone
out
to
lunch
hamel
replied
shortly
fentolin
stopped
painting
his
face
was
full
of
concern
as
he
looked
up
at
hamel
my
dear
sir
he
exclaimed
how
can
i
apologise
of
course
she
has
gone
out
to
lunch
she
has
gone
out
to
lady
saxthorpe
s
i
remember
the
subject
being
discussed
i
myself
in
fact
was
the
instigator
of
her
going
i
owe
you
a
thousand
apologies
hamel
let
me
make
what
amends
are
possible
for
your
useless
journey
dine
with
us
you
are
very
a
poor
amends
fentolin
continued
a
morning
like
this
was
made
for
lovers
sunshine
and
blue
sky
a
salt
breeze
flavoured
just
a
little
with
that
lavender
and
a
stroll
through
my
spring
gardens
where
my
hyacinths
are
like
a
field
of
purple
and
gold
a
mantle
of
jewels
upon
the
brown
earth
ah
well
one
s
thoughts
will
wander
to
the
beautiful
things
of
life
there
were
once
women
who
loved
me
hamel
looked
doubtfully
at
the
strange
little
figure
in
the
chair
was
this
genuine
he
wondered
a
voluntary
outburst
or
was
it
some
subtle
attempt
to
incite
sympathy
fentolin
seemed
almost
to
have
read
his
thought
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
your
pity
that
i
say
this
he
continued
mine
is
only
the
passing
across
the
line
which
age
as
well
as
infirmity
makes
inevitable
no
one
in
the
world
who
lives
to
grow
old
and
who
has
loved
and
felt
the
fire
of
it
in
his
veins
can
pass
that
line
without
sorrow
or
look
back
without
a
pang
i
am
among
a
great
army
well
well
i
shall
paint
no
more
he
concluded
abruptly
where
is
your
servant
hamel
asked
fentolin
glanced
around
him
carelessly
he
has
wandered
away
out
of
sight
he
knows
well
how
necessary
solitude
is
to
me
if
once
i
take
the
brush
between
my
fingers
solitude
natural
and
entire
i
mean
if
any
one
is
within
a
dozen
yards
of
me
i
know
it
even
though
i
can
not
see
them
meekins
is
wandering
somewhere
the
other
side
of
the
shall
i
call
him
on
no
account
fentolin
begged
presently
he
will
appear
in
plenty
of
time
there
is
the
morning
to
be
passed
barely
eleven
o
clock
i
think
now
i
shall
sit
in
my
chair
and
sink
a
little
down
and
dream
of
these
beautiful
lights
these
rolling
waves
these
patches
of
blue
and
shifting
green
i
can
form
them
in
my
brain
i
can
make
a
picture
there
even
though
my
fingers
refuse
to
move
you
are
not
an
aesthete
i
think
hamel
the
study
of
beauty
does
not
mean
to
you
what
it
did
to
your
father
and
my
father
and
in
a
smaller
way
to
perhaps
not
hamel
confessed
i
believe
i
feel
these
things
somewhere
because
they
bring
a
queer
sense
of
content
with
them
i
am
afraid
though
that
my
artistic
perceptions
are
not
so
keen
as
some
men
fentolin
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
it
is
the
physical
life
in
your
veins
too
splendid
to
permit
you
abstract
pleasures
compensations
again
you
see
compensations
i
wonder
what
the
law
is
that
governs
these
things
i
have
forgotten
sometimes
he
went
on
forgotten
my
own
infirmities
in
the
soft
intoxication
of
a
wonderful
seascape
only
he
went
on
his
face
a
little
grey
it
is
the
physical
in
life
which
triumphs
there
are
the
hungry
hours
which
nothing
will
his
head
sank
his
chin
rested
upon
his
chest
he
had
all
the
appearance
now
of
a
man
who
talks
in
bitter
earnest
yet
hamel
wondered
he
looked
towards
the
tower
there
was
no
sign
of
meekins
the
went
screaming
above
their
heads
fentolin
never
moved
his
eyes
seemed
half
closed
it
was
only
when
hamel
rose
to
his
feet
that
he
looked
swiftly
up
stay
with
me
i
beg
you
hamel
he
said
i
am
in
one
of
the
moods
when
solitude
even
for
a
moment
is
dangerous
do
you
know
what
i
have
sometimes
thought
to
myself
he
pointed
to
the
planked
way
which
led
down
the
steep
pebbly
beach
to
the
sea
i
have
sometimes
thought
he
went
on
that
it
would
be
glorious
to
find
a
friend
to
stand
by
my
side
at
the
top
of
the
planks
just
there
when
the
tide
was
high
and
to
bid
him
loose
my
chair
and
to
steer
it
myself
to
steer
it
down
the
narrow
path
into
the
arms
of
the
sea
the
first
touch
of
the
salt
waves
the
last
touch
of
life
why
not
one
sleeps
without
he
lifted
his
head
suddenly
meekins
had
appeared
coming
round
from
the
back
of
the
tower
instantly
fentolin
s
whole
manner
changed
he
sat
up
in
his
chair
it
is
arranged
then
he
said
you
dine
with
us
for
the
other
matters
of
which
you
have
spoken
well
let
them
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
you
are
not
very
kind
to
me
i
am
not
sure
whether
you
would
make
esther
a
good
husband
i
am
not
sure
even
that
i
like
you
you
take
no
pains
to
make
yourself
agreeable
considering
that
your
father
was
an
artist
you
seem
to
me
rather
a
dull
and
uninspired
young
man
but
who
can
tell
there
may
be
things
stirring
beneath
that
torpid
brain
of
yours
of
which
no
other
person
knows
save
the
concentrated
gaze
of
fentolin
s
keen
eyes
was
hard
to
meet
but
hamel
came
out
of
the
ordeal
without
flinching
at
eight
o
clock
fentolin
he
answered
i
can
see
that
i
must
try
to
earn
your
better
hamel
read
steadily
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
it
was
past
one
o
clock
when
he
rose
stiffly
from
his
seat
among
the
sand
knolls
and
strolling
back
to
the
tower
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
cloth
was
laid
for
luncheon
in
the
little
but
there
were
no
signs
of
hannah
cox
he
passed
on
into
the
kitchen
and
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
once
more
the
memory
of
his
own
work
passed
away
from
him
once
more
he
was
back
again
among
that
queer
clouded
tangle
of
strange
suspicions
of
thrilling
fears
which
had
assailed
him
at
times
ever
since
his
arrival
at
st
david
s
he
stopped
quite
short
the
words
which
rose
to
his
lips
died
away
he
felt
the
breathless
compelling
need
for
silence
and
grew
tense
in
the
effort
to
make
no
sound
hannah
cox
was
kneeling
on
the
stone
floor
her
ear
was
close
to
the
crack
of
the
door
which
led
into
the
her
face
half
turned
from
it
was
set
in
a
strange
concentrated
passion
of
listening
her
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
half
closed
she
took
no
more
notice
of
hamel
or
his
arrival
than
if
he
had
been
some
useless
piece
of
furniture
every
faculty
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
that
one
intense
effort
of
listening
there
was
no
need
of
her
finger
hamel
fell
in
at
once
with
a
mood
so
mesmeric
he
too
listened
the
small
clock
which
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
village
ticked
away
upon
the
mantelpiece
the
full
sea
fell
with
placid
softness
upon
the
high
beach
outside
some
slight
noise
of
cooking
came
from
the
stove
save
for
these
things
there
was
silence
yet
for
a
space
of
time
which
hamel
could
never
have
measured
they
both
listened
when
at
last
the
woman
rose
to
her
feet
hamel
finding
words
at
last
was
surprised
to
find
that
his
throat
was
dry
what
is
it
cox
he
asked
why
were
you
listening
there
her
face
was
absolutely
expressionless
she
was
busying
herself
now
with
a
small
saucepan
and
her
back
was
turned
towards
him
i
spend
my
life
sir
she
said
listening
and
waiting
one
never
knows
when
the
end
may
but
the
hamel
objected
no
one
has
been
in
there
his
morning
have
they
who
can
tell
she
answered
he
could
go
anywhere
when
he
chose
or
how
he
chose
through
the
keyhole
if
he
but
why
listen
hamel
persisted
there
is
nothing
in
there
now
but
some
odds
and
ends
of
she
turned
from
the
fire
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
her
eyes
were
colourless
her
tone
unemotional
maybe
there
s
no
harm
in
did
you
hear
anything
which
made
you
want
to
listen
who
can
tell
she
answered
a
woman
who
lives
alone
as
i
live
in
a
quiet
place
hears
things
so
often
that
other
folk
never
listen
to
there
s
always
something
in
my
ears
night
or
day
sometimes
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
s
in
this
world
or
the
other
it
was
like
that
with
me
just
then
it
was
for
that
reason
i
listened
your
luncheon
s
ready
hamel
walked
thoughtfully
back
into
his
he
seated
himself
before
a
spotless
cloth
and
watched
hannah
cox
spread
out
his
meal
if
there
s
anything
you
want
sir
she
said
i
shall
hear
you
at
a
word
the
kitchen
door
is
one
moment
she
lingered
there
patiently
with
the
tray
in
her
hand
there
was
some
sound
hamel
continued
perhaps
a
real
sound
perhaps
a
fancy
which
made
you
go
down
on
your
knees
in
the
kitchen
tell
me
what
it
the
sound
i
always
hear
sir
she
answered
quietly
i
hear
it
in
the
night
and
i
hear
it
when
i
stand
by
the
sea
and
look
out
i
have
heard
it
for
so
many
years
that
who
can
tell
whether
it
comes
from
this
world
or
the
other
the
cry
of
men
who
die
she
passed
out
hamel
looked
after
her
for
a
moment
like
a
man
in
a
dream
in
his
fancy
he
could
see
her
back
again
once
more
in
the
kitchen
kneeling
on
the
stone
floor
listening
chapter
xxix
a
cold
twilight
had
fallen
upon
the
land
when
hamel
left
the
tower
that
evening
and
walked
briskly
along
the
to
the
hall
little
patches
of
mist
hung
over
the
creeks
the
sky
was
almost
frosty
the
lights
from
david
s
hall
shone
like
cheerful
beacons
before
him
he
hastened
up
the
stone
steps
crossed
the
terrace
and
passed
into
the
hall
a
servant
conducted
him
at
once
to
the
fentolin
in
a
pink
evening
dress
with
a
pink
ornament
in
her
hair
held
out
both
her
hands
in
the
background
fentolin
in
his
evening
clothes
sat
with
folded
arms
leaning
back
in
his
carriage
he
listened
grimly
to
his
as
she
stood
with
hamel
s
hands
in
hers
my
dear
hamel
she
exclaimed
how
perfectly
charming
of
you
to
come
up
and
relieve
a
little
our
sad
loneliness
delightful
i
call
it
of
you
i
was
just
saying
so
to
hamel
looked
around
the
room
already
his
heart
was
beginning
to
sink
miss
fentolin
is
well
i
hope
he
asked
well
but
a
very
naughty
girl
her
mother
declared
i
let
her
go
to
lady
saxthorpe
s
to
lunch
and
now
we
have
had
simply
the
firmest
letter
from
lady
saxthorpe
they
insist
upon
keeping
esther
to
dine
and
sleep
i
have
had
to
send
her
evening
clothes
but
you
can
t
tell
hamel
how
i
miss
hamel
s
disappointment
was
a
little
too
obvious
to
pass
unnoticed
there
was
a
shade
of
annoyance
too
in
his
face
fentolin
smoothly
intervened
let
us
be
quite
candid
with
hamel
dear
florence
he
begged
i
have
spoken
to
my
and
told
her
the
substance
of
our
conversation
this
morning
he
proceeded
wheeling
his
chair
nearer
to
hamel
she
is
thunderstruck
she
wishes
to
reflect
to
consider
esther
chanced
to
be
away
we
have
encouraged
her
absence
for
a
few
more
i
hope
fentolin
hamel
said
simply
that
you
will
give
her
to
me
i
am
not
a
rich
man
but
i
am
fairly
well
off
i
should
be
willing
to
live
exactly
where
esther
wishes
and
i
would
do
my
best
to
make
her
fentolin
opened
her
lips
once
and
closed
them
again
she
laughed
a
little
a
laugh
the
hand
which
gripped
her
fan
was
straining
so
that
the
blue
veins
stood
out
almost
like
whipcord
esther
is
very
young
hamel
we
must
talk
this
over
you
have
known
her
for
such
a
very
short
a
servant
announced
dinner
and
hamel
offered
his
arm
to
his
hostess
is
gerald
away
too
he
asked
we
do
indeed
owe
you
our
apologies
fentolin
declared
gerald
is
spending
a
couple
of
days
at
the
dormy
house
at
brancaster
a
golf
arrangement
made
some
time
he
promised
to
play
with
me
hamel
remarked
thoughtfully
he
said
nothing
about
going
i
fear
that
like
most
young
men
of
his
age
he
has
little
memory
fentolin
sighed
however
he
will
be
back
or
the
next
day
i
owe
you
my
apologies
hamel
for
our
lack
of
young
people
we
must
do
our
best
to
entertain
our
guest
florence
you
must
be
at
your
best
dear
you
must
tell
him
some
of
those
capital
stories
of
fentolin
shivered
for
a
moment
hamel
as
he
handed
her
to
her
place
was
struck
by
a
strange
look
which
she
threw
upon
him
half
furtive
full
of
pain
her
hand
almost
clung
to
his
she
slipped
a
little
and
he
held
her
tightly
then
he
was
suddenly
conscious
that
something
hard
was
being
pressed
into
his
palm
he
drew
his
hand
away
at
once
you
seem
a
little
unsteady
this
evening
my
dear
florence
fentolin
remarked
peering
across
the
round
table
she
eyed
him
nonchalantly
enough
the
floor
is
slippery
she
said
i
was
glad
for
a
moment
of
hamel
s
strong
hand
where
are
those
dear
puppies
she
went
on
come
and
sit
by
your
mistress
at
hamel
s
fingers
inside
his
waistcoat
pocket
were
smoothing
out
the
crumpled
piece
of
paper
which
she
had
passed
to
him
soon
he
had
it
quite
flat
fentolin
as
though
freed
from
some
anxiety
chattered
away
gaily
i
don
t
know
that
i
shall
apologise
to
hamel
at
all
for
the
young
people
being
away
she
declared
just
fancy
what
we
have
saved
him
from
a
solitary
meal
served
by
hannah
cox
do
you
know
that
they
say
she
is
hamel
so
far
she
has
looked
after
me
very
well
hamel
observed
her
intellect
is
defective
fentolin
remarked
on
one
point
only
the
good
woman
is
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
her
husband
and
sons
are
still
calling
to
her
from
the
dagger
rocks
it
is
almost
pitiful
to
meet
her
wandering
about
there
on
a
stormy
night
the
seacoasts
are
full
of
these
little
village
tragedies
real
tragedies
too
however
insignificant
they
may
seem
to
fentolin
s
tone
was
gently
sympathetic
he
changed
the
subject
a
moment
or
two
later
however
nero
fiddles
he
said
while
rome
burns
there
are
hundreds
in
our
position
yet
it
certainly
seems
queer
that
we
should
be
sitting
here
so
quietly
when
the
whole
country
is
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
i
see
the
press
this
morning
is
preaching
an
immediate
declaration
of
against
whom
fentolin
asked
fentolin
smiled
that
does
seem
to
be
rather
the
trouble
he
admitted
russia
austria
germany
italy
and
france
are
all
assisting
at
a
conference
to
which
no
english
representative
has
been
bidden
in
a
sense
of
course
that
is
equivalent
to
an
act
of
hostility
from
all
these
countries
towards
england
the
question
is
whether
we
have
or
have
not
a
secret
understanding
with
france
and
if
so
how
far
she
will
be
bound
by
it
there
is
a
rumour
that
when
monsieur
deschelles
was
asked
formally
whom
he
represented
that
he
replied
france
and
great
there
may
be
something
in
it
it
is
hard
to
see
how
any
english
statesman
could
have
left
unguarded
the
mediterranean
with
all
that
it
means
trusting
simply
to
the
faith
of
a
country
with
whom
we
have
no
binding
agreement
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
mobilisation
of
the
fleet
if
france
is
really
faithful
one
wonders
if
there
was
need
for
such
an
extreme
i
am
out
of
touch
with
political
affairs
hamel
declared
i
have
been
away
from
england
for
so
i
on
the
other
hand
fentolin
continued
his
eyes
glittering
a
little
have
made
the
study
of
the
political
situation
in
europe
my
hobby
for
years
i
have
sent
to
me
the
leading
newspapers
of
berlin
rome
paris
petersburg
and
vienna
for
two
hours
every
day
i
read
them
side
by
side
it
is
curious
sometimes
to
note
the
common
understanding
which
seems
to
exist
between
the
powers
not
bound
by
any
formal
alliance
for
years
war
seemed
a
very
unlikely
thing
and
now
he
added
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
i
pronounce
it
almost
a
hamel
looked
at
his
host
a
little
curiously
fentolin
s
gentleness
of
expression
seemed
to
have
departed
his
face
was
hard
his
eyes
agleam
he
had
almost
the
look
of
a
bird
of
prey
for
some
reason
the
thought
of
war
seemed
to
be
a
joy
to
him
perhaps
he
read
something
of
hamel
s
wonder
in
his
expression
for
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
dismissed
the
subject
well
he
concluded
all
these
things
lie
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
i
dare
say
you
wonder
hamel
why
a
poor
useless
creature
like
myself
should
take
the
slightest
interest
in
passing
events
it
is
just
the
fascination
of
the
i
want
your
opinion
about
that
champagne
florence
dear
you
must
join
us
we
will
drink
to
hamel
s
health
we
will
perhaps
couple
that
toast
in
our
minds
with
the
sentiment
which
i
am
sure
is
not
very
far
from
your
thoughts
hamel
raised
his
glass
and
bowed
to
his
host
and
hostess
he
was
not
wholly
at
his
ease
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
watched
with
a
queer
persistence
by
both
of
them
fentolin
continued
to
talk
and
laugh
with
a
gaiety
which
was
too
obviously
forced
fentolin
posed
for
a
while
as
the
benevolent
listener
he
mildly
applauded
his
s
stories
and
encouraged
hamel
in
the
recital
of
some
of
his
reminiscences
suddenly
the
door
was
opened
miss
price
appeared
she
walked
smoothly
across
the
room
and
stood
by
fentolin
s
side
stooping
down
she
whispered
in
his
ear
he
pushed
his
chair
back
a
little
from
the
table
his
face
was
dark
with
anger
i
said
not
before
ten
he
muttered
again
she
spoke
in
his
ear
so
softly
that
the
sound
of
her
voice
itself
scarcely
travelled
even
as
far
as
where
hamel
was
sitting
fentolin
looked
steadfastly
for
a
moment
at
his
and
from
her
to
hamel
then
he
backed
his
chair
away
front
the
table
i
shall
have
to
ask
to
be
excused
for
three
minutes
he
said
i
must
speak
upon
the
telephone
it
is
a
call
from
some
one
who
declares
that
they
have
important
he
turned
the
of
his
chair
and
with
miss
price
by
his
side
passed
across
the
out
of
the
oasis
of
lights
into
the
shadows
and
through
the
open
door
from
there
he
turned
his
head
before
he
disappeared
as
though
to
watch
his
guest
fentolin
was
busy
fondling
one
of
her
dogs
which
she
had
raised
to
her
lap
and
hamel
was
watching
her
with
a
tolerant
smile
koto
you
little
idiot
why
can
t
you
sit
up
like
your
sister
was
its
tail
in
the
way
then
hamel
she
whispered
under
her
breath
so
softly
that
he
barely
caught
the
words
although
he
was
only
a
few
feet
away
don
t
look
at
me
i
feel
as
though
we
were
being
watched
all
the
time
you
can
destroy
that
piece
of
paper
in
your
pocket
all
that
it
says
is
leave
here
immediately
after
hamel
sipped
his
wine
in
a
nonchalant
fashion
his
fingers
had
strayed
over
the
silky
coat
of
the
little
dog
which
she
had
held
out
as
though
for
his
inspection
how
can
i
he
asked
what
excuse
can
i
make
invent
one
she
insisted
swiftly
leave
here
before
ten
o
clock
don
t
let
anything
keep
you
and
destroy
that
piece
of
paper
in
your
pocket
if
you
can
but
fentolin
he
began
she
caught
up
one
of
her
absurd
little
pets
and
held
it
to
her
mouth
meekins
is
in
the
doorway
she
whispered
don
t
argue
with
me
please
you
are
in
danger
you
know
nothing
about
pass
me
the
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
smoking
quickly
she
held
one
of
the
dogs
on
her
knee
and
talked
rubbish
to
it
hamel
watched
her
leaning
back
in
his
carved
oak
chair
and
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
the
pity
from
his
eyes
the
woman
was
playing
a
part
playing
it
with
desperate
and
pitiful
earnestness
a
part
which
seemed
the
more
tragical
because
of
the
soft
splendour
of
their
surroundings
from
the
shadowy
walls
huge
pictures
hung
about
them
a
strange
and
yet
impressive
background
their
small
round
with
its
rare
cut
glass
its
perfect
appointments
its
bowls
of
pink
roses
was
like
a
spot
of
wonderful
colour
in
the
great
room
two
men
servants
stood
at
the
sideboard
a
few
yards
away
a
triumph
of
negativeness
the
butler
who
had
been
absent
for
a
moment
stood
now
silently
waiting
behind
his
master
s
place
hamel
was
oppressed
during
those
few
minutes
of
waiting
by
a
curious
sense
of
unreality
as
though
he
were
taking
part
in
some
strange
tableau
there
was
something
unreal
about
his
surroundings
and
his
own
presence
there
something
unreal
in
the
atmosphere
charged
as
it
seemed
to
be
with
some
omen
of
impending
happenings
something
unreal
in
that
whispered
warning
those
few
hoarsely
uttered
words
which
had
stolen
to
his
hearing
across
the
clusters
of
drooping
roses
the
absurd
babble
of
the
woman
who
sat
there
with
tragic
things
under
the
powder
with
which
her
face
was
daubed
koto
must
learn
to
sit
upon
his
tail
like
that
no
not
another
grape
till
he
sits
up
there
then
she
was
leaning
forward
with
a
grape
between
her
teeth
towards
the
tiny
animal
who
was
trying
in
vain
to
balance
his
absurdly
shaped
little
body
upon
the
tablecloth
hamel
without
looking
around
knew
quite
well
what
was
happening
soon
he
heard
the
click
of
the
chair
fentolin
was
back
in
his
place
his
skin
seemed
paler
and
more
than
ever
his
eyes
glittered
it
seems
he
announced
quietly
as
he
raised
his
to
his
lips
with
the
air
of
one
needing
support
that
we
entertained
an
angel
unawares
here
this
dunster
is
lost
for
the
second
time
a
very
important
personage
he
turns
out
to
you
mean
the
american
whom
gerald
brought
home
after
the
accident
fentolin
asked
carelessly
fentolin
replied
he
insisted
upon
continuing
his
journey
before
he
was
strong
enough
i
warned
him
of
what
might
happen
he
has
evidently
been
take
ill
somewhere
it
seems
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
do
you
mean
that
he
has
disappeared
altogether
this
time
hamel
asked
fentolin
shook
his
head
no
he
has
found
his
way
to
the
hague
safely
enough
he
is
lying
there
at
a
hotel
in
the
city
but
he
is
unconscious
there
is
some
talk
about
his
having
been
robbed
on
the
way
at
any
rate
they
are
tracing
his
movements
backwards
we
are
to
be
honoured
with
a
visit
from
one
of
scotland
yard
s
detectives
to
reconstruct
his
journey
from
here
our
quiet
little
corner
of
the
world
is
becoming
quite
notorious
florence
dear
you
are
tired
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
your
headache
continues
i
am
sure
we
will
not
be
selfish
hamel
and
i
are
going
to
have
a
long
evening
in
the
library
let
me
recommend
a
phenacetin
and
she
rose
at
once
to
her
feet
with
a
dog
under
either
arm
i
ll
take
the
phenacetin
she
promised
but
i
hate
going
to
bed
early
shall
i
see
you
again
i
wonder
hamel
not
this
evening
i
fear
he
answered
i
am
going
to
ask
fentolin
to
excuse
me
she
passed
out
of
the
room
hamel
escorted
her
as
far
as
the
door
and
then
returned
fentolin
was
sitting
quite
still
in
his
chair
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
tablecloth
he
looked
up
quickly
as
hamel
resumed
his
seat
you
are
not
in
earnest
i
hope
hamel
he
said
when
you
tell
me
that
you
must
leave
early
i
have
been
anticipating
a
long
evening
my
library
is
filled
with
books
on
south
america
which
i
want
to
discuss
with
another
evening
if
you
don
t
mind
hamel
begged
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
my
hurrying
fentolin
looked
up
from
underneath
his
eyelids
his
glance
was
quick
and
penetrating
why
this
haste
hamel
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
admitted
i
had
an
idea
while
i
was
reading
an
article
on
cantilever
bridges
this
morning
i
want
to
work
it
fentolin
glanced
behind
him
the
door
of
the
was
closed
the
servants
had
disappeared
meekins
alone
looking
more
like
a
prize
fighter
than
ever
in
his
somber
evening
clothes
had
taken
the
place
of
the
butler
behind
his
master
s
chair
we
shall
see
fentolin
said
quietly
chapter
xxx
fentolin
pointed
to
the
little
pile
of
books
upon
the
table
the
deep
the
lamps
the
decanter
of
wine
he
had
insisted
upon
a
visit
however
brief
to
the
library
it
is
a
student
s
appeal
which
i
make
to
you
hamel
he
said
with
a
whimsical
smile
here
we
are
in
my
study
with
the
door
closed
secure
against
interruption
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate
a
bowling
and
wind
outside
let
us
go
together
over
the
ground
of
your
last
wonderful
expedition
over
the
andes
you
will
find
that
i
am
not
altogether
ignorant
of
your
profession
or
of
those
very
interesting
geological
problems
which
you
spoke
of
in
connection
with
that
marvellous
railway
scheme
we
will
discuss
them
side
by
side
as
sybarites
hang
ourselves
around
with
cigarette
smoke
drink
wine
and
presently
coffee
it
is
necessary
is
it
not
for
many
reasons
that
we
become
better
acquainted
you
realise
that
i
am
sure
and
you
will
not
persist
in
returning
to
your
selfish
hamel
s
eyes
were
fixed
a
little
longingly
upon
some
of
the
volumes
with
which
the
table
was
covered
you
must
not
think
me
ungrateful
or
churlish
fentolin
he
begged
i
have
a
habit
of
keeping
promises
which
i
make
to
myself
and
i
have
made
myself
a
promise
that
i
will
be
back
at
the
tower
by
ten
o
you
are
obdurate
fentolin
asked
softly
i
am
afraid
i
fentolin
busied
himself
with
the
handle
of
his
chair
tell
me
he
insisted
is
there
any
other
person
save
yourself
to
whom
you
have
given
this
mysterious
promise
no
one
hamel
replied
promptly
i
am
a
person
very
sensitive
to
atmosphere
fentolin
continued
slowly
since
the
unfortunate
visit
of
this
man
dunster
i
seem
to
have
been
conscious
of
a
certain
suspicion
a
little
cloud
of
suspicion
under
which
i
seem
to
live
and
move
even
among
the
members
of
my
own
household
my
is
nervous
and
hysterical
gerald
has
been
sullen
and
disobedient
esther
has
avoided
me
and
now
well
i
find
even
your
attitude
a
little
difficult
to
understand
what
does
it
mean
hamel
hamel
shook
his
head
i
am
not
in
the
confidence
of
the
different
members
of
your
family
he
answered
so
far
as
i
personally
am
concerned
it
pleases
me
sometimes
fentolin
interrupted
to
interfere
to
some
extent
in
the
affairs
of
the
outside
world
if
i
do
so
that
is
my
business
i
do
it
for
my
own
amusement
it
is
at
no
time
a
serious
position
which
i
take
up
have
i
by
any
chance
hamel
become
an
object
of
suspicion
to
you
there
are
matters
in
which
you
are
concerned
hamel
admitted
which
i
do
not
understand
but
i
see
no
purpose
in
discussing
fentolin
wheeled
his
chair
round
in
a
semicircle
he
was
now
between
the
door
and
hamel
weaker
mortals
than
i
hamel
he
said
calmly
have
wielded
before
now
the
powers
of
life
and
death
from
my
chair
i
can
make
the
lightnings
bite
science
has
done
away
with
the
triumph
of
muscularity
even
as
we
are
here
together
at
this
moment
hamel
if
we
should
disagree
it
is
i
who
am
the
preordained
hamel
saw
the
glitter
in
his
hand
this
was
the
end
then
of
all
doubt
he
remained
silent
suspicions
which
are
in
a
sense
absurd
fentolin
continued
have
grown
until
i
find
them
obtrusive
and
obnoxious
what
have
i
to
do
with
john
dunster
i
sent
him
out
from
my
house
if
he
is
lost
or
ill
the
affair
is
not
mine
yet
one
by
one
those
around
me
are
falling
away
i
told
you
an
hour
ago
that
gerald
was
at
brancaster
it
is
a
lie
he
has
left
this
house
but
no
soul
in
it
knows
his
hamel
started
you
mean
that
he
has
run
away
fentolin
nodded
all
that
i
can
surmise
is
that
he
has
followed
dunster
he
proceeded
he
has
an
idea
that
in
some
way
i
robbed
or
injured
the
man
he
has
broken
the
bond
of
relationship
between
us
he
has
broken
his
solemn
vow
he
has
run
a
grave
and
terrible
what
of
miss
esther
hamel
asked
quickly
i
have
sent
her
away
fentolin
replied
until
we
come
to
a
clear
understanding
you
and
i
you
seem
to
be
a
harmless
enough
person
hamel
but
appearances
are
sometimes
deceptive
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
you
are
a
by
whom
hamel
demanded
by
those
in
whom
i
trust
fentolin
told
him
sternly
you
are
a
friend
of
reginald
kinsley
you
met
him
in
norwich
the
other
day
secretly
kinsley
s
chief
is
a
member
of
the
government
he
is
one
of
those
who
will
find
eternal
obloquy
if
the
hague
conference
comes
to
a
successful
termination
for
some
strange
reason
i
am
supposed
to
have
robbed
or
harmed
the
one
man
in
the
world
whose
message
might
bring
to
nought
that
conference
are
you
here
to
watch
me
hamel
are
you
one
of
those
who
believe
that
i
am
either
in
the
pay
of
a
foreign
country
or
that
my
harmless
efforts
to
interest
myself
in
great
things
are
efforts
inimical
to
this
country
that
i
am
in
short
a
traitor
you
must
admit
that
many
of
your
actions
are
incomprehensible
hamel
replied
slowly
there
are
things
here
which
i
do
not
understand
which
certainly
require
still
why
do
you
make
them
your
business
fentolin
persisted
if
indeed
the
course
which
i
steer
is
a
harmless
one
he
continued
with
a
strange
new
glitter
in
his
eyes
then
you
are
an
impertinent
stranger
to
whom
my
doors
can
not
any
longer
be
open
if
you
have
taken
advantage
of
my
hospitality
to
spy
upon
me
and
my
actions
if
indeed
you
have
a
mission
here
then
you
can
carry
it
with
you
down
into
hell
i
understand
that
you
are
threatening
me
hamel
murmured
fentolin
smiled
scarcely
that
my
young
friend
i
am
not
quite
the
obvious
sort
of
villain
who
flourishes
revolvers
and
lures
his
victims
into
secret
chambers
these
words
to
you
are
simply
words
of
warning
i
am
not
like
other
men
neither
am
i
used
to
being
crossed
when
i
am
crossed
i
am
dangerous
leave
here
if
you
will
in
safety
and
mind
your
own
affairs
but
if
you
show
one
particle
of
curiosity
as
to
mine
if
you
interfere
in
matters
which
concern
me
and
me
only
remember
that
you
are
encircled
by
powers
which
are
entirely
ruthless
absolutely
omnipotent
you
can
walk
back
to
the
tower
and
remember
that
there
isn
t
a
step
you
take
which
might
not
be
your
last
if
i
willed
it
and
never
a
soul
the
wiser
there
s
a
very
hungry
little
mother
here
who
takes
her
victims
and
holds
them
tight
you
can
hear
her
calling
to
you
now
listen
he
held
up
his
finger
the
tide
had
turned
and
through
the
window
came
the
low
thunder
of
the
waves
you
decline
to
share
my
evening
fentolin
concluded
let
it
be
so
go
your
own
way
hamel
only
take
care
that
your
way
does
not
cross
he
backed
his
chair
slowly
and
pressed
the
bell
hamel
felt
himself
dismissed
he
passed
out
into
the
hall
the
door
of
the
stood
open
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
fentolin
s
thin
voice
singing
some
little
french
song
he
hesitated
and
then
stepped
in
with
one
hand
she
beckoned
him
to
her
continuing
to
play
all
the
time
he
stepped
over
to
her
side
i
come
to
make
my
adieux
he
whispered
with
a
glance
towards
the
door
you
are
leaving
then
she
asked
quickly
he
nodded
mr
fentolin
is
in
a
strange
humour
she
went
on
a
moment
later
after
she
had
struck
the
final
chords
of
her
song
there
are
things
going
on
around
us
which
no
one
can
understand
i
think
that
one
of
his
schemes
has
miscarried
he
has
gone
too
far
he
suspects
you
i
can
not
tell
you
why
or
how
if
only
you
would
go
away
what
about
esther
he
asked
quietly
you
must
leave
her
she
cried
with
a
little
catch
in
her
throat
gerald
has
broken
away
esther
and
i
must
carry
still
the
she
motioned
him
to
go
he
touched
her
fingers
for
a
moment
mrs
fentolin
he
said
i
have
been
a
good
many
years
making
up
my
mind
now
that
i
have
done
so
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
will
keep
esther
from
she
looked
at
him
a
little
pitifully
a
little
wistfully
then
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
she
turned
round
to
the
piano
and
recommenced
to
play
hamel
took
his
coat
and
hat
from
a
servant
who
was
waiting
in
the
hall
and
passed
out
into
the
night
he
walked
briskly
until
he
reached
the
tower
the
wind
had
risen
but
there
was
still
enough
light
to
help
him
on
his
way
the
little
building
was
in
complete
darkness
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
lit
the
lamp
and
holding
it
over
his
head
went
down
the
passage
and
into
the
kitchen
then
he
gave
a
start
the
lamp
nearly
slipped
from
his
fingers
kneeling
on
the
stone
floor
in
very
much
the
same
attitude
as
he
had
found
her
earlier
in
the
day
hannah
cox
was
crouching
patiently
by
the
door
which
led
into
the
her
face
expressionless
her
ear
turned
towards
the
crack
she
was
still
listening
chapter
xxxi
hamel
set
down
the
lamp
upon
the
table
he
glanced
at
the
little
clock
upon
the
dresser
it
was
a
quarter
past
ten
the
woman
had
observed
his
entrance
although
it
seemed
in
no
way
to
have
discomposed
her
do
you
know
the
time
cox
he
asked
you
ought
to
have
been
home
hours
ago
what
are
you
doing
there
she
rose
to
her
feet
her
expression
was
one
of
dogged
but
patient
humility
i
started
for
home
before
nine
o
clock
sir
she
told
him
but
it
was
worse
than
ever
all
the
way
along
by
the
sea
i
seemed
to
hear
their
voices
so
i
came
back
i
came
back
to
listen
i
have
been
listening
for
an
hamel
looked
at
her
with
a
frown
upon
his
forehead
mrs
cox
he
said
i
wish
i
could
understand
what
it
is
that
you
have
in
your
mind
those
are
not
real
voices
that
you
hear
you
can
not
believe
that
not
real
voices
she
repeated
without
the
slightest
expression
in
her
tone
of
course
not
and
tell
me
what
connection
you
find
between
these
fancies
of
yours
and
that
room
why
do
you
come
and
listen
here
i
do
not
know
she
answered
patiently
you
must
have
some
reason
he
persisted
i
have
no
reason
she
assured
him
only
some
day
i
shall
see
behind
these
doors
afterwards
i
shall
hear
the
voices
no
she
was
busy
tying
a
shawl
around
her
head
hamel
watched
her
still
puzzled
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
there
was
some
method
behind
her
madness
tell
me
i
have
found
you
listening
here
before
have
you
ever
heard
anything
suspicious
i
have
heard
nothing
yet
she
admitted
nothing
that
come
he
continued
couldn
t
we
clear
this
matter
up
sensibly
do
you
believe
that
there
is
anybody
in
there
do
you
believe
the
place
is
being
used
in
any
way
for
a
wrong
purpose
if
so
we
will
insist
upon
having
the
keys
from
fentolin
he
can
not
refuse
the
place
is
mr
fentolin
would
not
give
you
the
keys
sir
she
replied
if
he
did
it
would
be
would
you
like
me
to
break
the
door
in
hamel
asked
you
could
not
do
it
sir
she
told
him
not
you
nor
anybody
else
the
door
is
thicker
than
my
fist
of
solid
oak
it
was
a
mechanic
from
new
york
who
fitted
the
locks
i
have
heard
it
said
in
the
village
bill
hamas
the
carpenter
declares
that
there
are
double
doors
the
workmen
who
were
employed
here
were
housed
in
a
tent
upon
the
beach
and
sent
home
the
day
they
finished
their
job
they
were
never
allowed
in
the
village
they
were
foreigners
most
of
them
they
came
from
nobody
knows
where
and
when
they
had
finished
they
disappeared
why
was
that
sir
what
is
there
inside
which
fentolin
needs
to
guard
so
carefully
mr
fentolin
has
invented
something
hamel
explained
he
keeps
the
model
in
there
inventors
are
very
jealous
of
their
she
looked
down
upon
the
floor
for
a
moment
i
shall
be
here
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
sir
i
will
give
you
your
breakfast
at
the
usual
hamel
opened
the
door
for
her
good
night
cox
he
said
would
you
like
me
to
walk
a
little
way
with
you
it
s
a
lonely
path
to
the
village
and
the
dikes
are
thank
you
no
sir
she
replied
it
s
a
lonely
way
right
enough
but
it
isn
t
loneliness
that
frightens
me
i
am
less
afraid
out
with
the
winds
and
the
darkness
than
under
this
roof
if
i
lose
my
way
and
wander
all
night
upon
the
marsh
i
ll
be
safer
out
there
than
you
she
passed
away
and
hamel
watched
her
disappear
into
the
darkness
then
he
dragged
out
a
bowl
of
tobacco
and
filled
a
pipe
although
he
was
half
ashamed
of
himself
he
strolled
back
once
more
into
the
kitchen
and
drawing
up
a
stool
he
sat
down
just
where
he
had
discovered
hannah
cox
sat
still
and
listened
no
sound
of
any
sort
reached
him
he
sat
there
for
ten
minutes
then
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
she
is
mad
of
course
he
muttered
he
mixed
himself
a
whisky
and
soda
relit
his
pipe
which
had
gone
out
and
drew
up
an
to
the
fire
which
she
had
left
him
in
the
the
wind
had
increased
in
violence
and
the
panes
of
his
window
rattled
continually
he
yawned
and
tried
to
fancy
that
he
was
sleepy
it
was
useless
he
was
compelled
to
admit
the
truth
that
his
nerves
were
all
on
edge
in
a
sense
he
was
afraid
the
thought
of
bed
repelled
him
he
had
not
a
single
impulse
towards
repose
outside
the
wind
all
the
time
was
gathering
force
more
than
once
his
window
was
splashed
with
the
spray
carried
on
by
the
wind
which
followed
the
tide
he
sat
quite
still
and
tried
to
think
calmly
tried
to
piece
together
in
his
mind
the
sequence
of
events
which
had
brought
him
to
this
part
of
the
world
and
which
had
led
to
his
remaining
where
he
was
an
undesired
at
the
threshold
of
miles
fentolin
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
had
burned
his
boats
there
was
no
longer
any
pretence
of
friendliness
possible
between
him
and
this
strange
creature
fentolin
suspected
him
realised
that
he
himself
was
suspected
but
of
what
hamel
moved
in
his
chair
restlessly
sometimes
that
gathering
cloud
of
suspicion
seemed
to
him
grotesque
of
what
real
harm
could
he
be
capable
this
little
autocrat
who
from
his
chair
seemed
to
exercise
such
a
malign
influence
upon
every
one
with
whom
he
was
brought
into
contact
hamel
sighed
the
riddle
was
insoluble
with
a
sudden
rush
of
warmer
and
more
joyous
feelings
he
let
the
subject
slip
away
from
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
dreamed
for
a
while
there
was
a
new
world
before
him
joys
which
only
so
short
a
time
ago
he
had
fancied
had
passed
him
by
he
sat
up
in
his
chair
with
a
start
the
fire
had
become
merely
a
handful
of
grey
ashes
his
limbs
were
numb
and
stiff
the
lamp
was
flickering
out
he
had
been
dozing
how
long
he
had
no
idea
something
had
awakened
him
abruptly
there
was
a
cold
draught
blowing
through
the
room
he
turned
his
head
his
hands
still
gripping
the
sides
of
his
chair
his
heart
gave
a
leap
the
outer
door
was
a
few
inches
open
was
being
held
open
by
some
invisible
force
there
was
some
one
there
some
one
on
the
point
of
entering
stealthily
even
as
he
watched
the
crack
became
a
little
wider
he
sat
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
that
opening
space
the
unseen
hand
was
still
at
work
every
instant
he
expected
to
see
a
face
thrust
forward
the
sensation
of
absolute
physical
fear
by
which
he
was
oppressed
was
a
revelation
to
him
he
found
himself
wishing
almost
feverishly
that
he
was
armed
the
physical
strength
in
which
he
had
trusted
seemed
to
him
at
that
instant
a
valueless
and
impotent
thing
there
was
a
splash
of
spray
or
raindrops
against
the
window
and
through
the
crack
in
the
door
the
lamp
chimney
hissed
and
spluttered
and
finally
the
light
went
out
the
room
was
in
sudden
darkness
hamel
sprang
then
to
his
feet
silence
had
become
an
intolerable
thing
he
felt
the
close
presence
of
another
human
being
creeping
in
upon
him
who
s
there
he
cried
who
s
there
i
say
there
was
no
direct
answer
only
the
door
was
pushed
a
little
further
open
he
had
stepped
close
to
it
now
the
sweep
of
the
wind
was
upon
his
face
although
in
the
black
darkness
he
could
see
nothing
and
then
a
sudden
recollection
flashed
in
upon
him
from
his
trousers
pocket
he
snatched
a
little
electric
torch
in
an
instant
his
thumb
had
pressed
the
button
he
turned
it
upon
the
door
the
shivering
white
hand
which
held
it
open
was
plainly
in
view
it
was
the
hand
of
a
woman
he
stepped
swiftly
forward
a
dark
figure
almost
fell
into
his
arms
mrs
fentolin
he
exclaimed
aghast
an
hysterical
cry
choked
and
subdued
broke
from
her
lips
he
half
carried
half
led
her
to
his
suddenly
steadied
by
the
presence
of
this
emergency
he
closed
the
outside
door
and
relit
the
lamp
with
firm
fingers
then
he
turned
to
face
her
and
his
amazement
at
this
strange
visit
became
consternation
she
was
still
in
her
of
black
satin
but
it
was
soaked
through
with
the
rain
and
hung
about
her
like
a
black
shroud
she
had
lost
one
shoe
and
there
was
a
great
hole
in
her
silk
stocking
her
hair
was
all
disarranged
one
of
its
numerous
switches
was
hanging
down
over
her
ear
the
rouge
upon
her
cheeks
had
run
down
on
to
her
neck
she
sat
there
looking
at
him
out
of
her
hollow
eyes
like
some
trapped
animal
she
was
shaking
with
fear
it
was
fear
not
faintness
which
kept
her
silent
tell
me
please
what
is
the
matter
he
insisted
speaking
as
indifferently
as
he
could
tell
me
at
once
what
has
happened
she
pointed
to
the
door
lock
it
she
implored
he
turned
down
the
latch
and
drew
the
bolt
the
sound
seemed
to
give
her
a
little
courage
her
fingers
went
to
her
throat
for
a
moment
give
me
some
he
poured
out
some
she
drank
only
a
sip
and
put
it
down
again
he
began
to
be
alarmed
she
had
the
appearance
of
one
who
has
suddenly
lost
her
senses
please
tell
me
just
what
has
happened
he
begged
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
you
know
i
will
but
you
must
tell
me
do
you
realise
that
it
is
three
o
clock
i
should
have
been
in
bed
only
i
went
to
sleep
over
the
fire
i
know
she
answered
it
is
just
the
wind
that
has
taken
away
my
breath
it
was
a
hard
struggle
to
get
here
listen
you
are
our
friend
hamel
esther
s
and
mine
swear
that
you
are
our
friend
upon
my
honour
i
am
he
assured
her
you
should
know
for
eight
years
she
went
on
her
voice
clear
enough
now
although
it
seemed
charged
with
a
curious
metallic
vibration
for
eight
years
we
ve
borne
it
all
three
of
us
slaves
bound
hand
and
foot
lashed
with
his
tongue
driven
along
the
path
of
his
desires
we
have
seen
evil
things
we
have
been
on
the
point
of
rebellion
and
he
s
come
a
little
nearer
and
he
s
pointed
back
he
has
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
i
have
walked
by
the
side
of
his
chair
loathing
it
loathing
myself
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
down
below
just
where
it
happened
you
know
what
happened
there
hamel
you
mean
where
fentolin
met
with
his
it
was
no
accident
she
cried
glancing
for
a
moment
around
her
it
was
no
accident
it
was
my
husband
who
took
him
up
and
threw
him
over
the
terrace
down
below
my
husband
who
tried
to
kill
him
esther
s
father
gerald
s
father
miles
was
in
the
foreign
office
then
and
he
did
something
disgraceful
he
sold
a
secret
to
austria
he
was
always
a
great
gambler
and
he
was
in
debt
seymour
found
out
about
it
he
followed
him
down
here
they
met
upon
the
terrace
i
i
saw
it
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
no
one
has
known
the
truth
he
murmured
no
one
has
ever
known
she
assented
and
our
broken
lives
have
been
the
price
it
was
miles
himself
who
made
the
bargain
we
we
can
t
go
on
i
begin
to
understand
hamel
said
softly
you
suffer
everything
from
miles
fentolin
because
he
kept
the
secret
very
well
that
belongs
to
the
past
something
has
happened
something
which
has
brought
you
here
tell
me
about
it
once
more
her
voice
began
to
shake
we
ve
seen
terrible
things
horrible
things
she
faltered
we
ve
held
our
peace
perhaps
it
s
been
nearly
as
bad
before
but
we
ve
closed
our
eyes
we
haven
t
wanted
to
know
now
we
can
t
help
it
hamel
esther
isn
t
at
lord
saxthorpe
s
she
never
went
there
they
didn
t
ask
her
and
dunster
the
man
dunster
where
is
esther
hamel
interrupted
suddenly
locked
up
away
from
you
locked
up
because
she
rebelled
and
dunster
she
shook
her
head
her
eyes
were
filled
with
horror
but
he
left
the
hall
i
saw
him
she
shook
her
head
it
wasn
t
dunster
it
was
the
man
miles
makes
use
of
ryan
the
librarian
he
was
once
an
where
is
dunster
then
hamel
asked
quickly
what
has
become
of
him
she
opened
her
lips
and
closed
them
again
struggled
to
speak
and
failed
she
sat
there
breathing
quickly
but
silent
the
power
of
speech
had
gone
chapter
xxxii
hamel
for
the
next
few
minutes
forgot
everything
else
in
his
efforts
to
restore
to
consciousness
his
unexpected
visitor
he
rebuilt
the
fire
heated
some
water
upon
his
spirit
lamp
and
forced
some
hot
drink
between
the
lips
of
the
woman
who
was
now
almost
in
a
state
of
collapse
then
he
wrapped
her
round
in
his
own
ulster
and
drew
her
closer
to
the
fire
he
tried
during
those
few
moments
to
put
away
the
memory
of
all
that
she
had
told
him
gradually
she
began
to
recover
she
opened
her
eyes
and
drew
a
little
sigh
she
made
no
effort
at
speech
however
she
simply
lay
and
looked
at
him
like
some
wounded
animal
he
came
over
to
her
side
and
chafed
one
of
her
cold
hands
come
he
said
at
last
you
begin
to
look
more
like
yourself
now
you
are
quite
safe
in
here
and
for
esther
s
sake
as
well
as
your
own
you
know
that
i
am
your
she
nodded
and
her
fingers
gently
pressed
his
i
am
sure
of
it
she
murmured
now
let
us
see
where
we
are
he
continued
tell
me
exactly
why
you
risked
so
much
by
leaving
david
s
hall
and
coming
down
here
isn
t
there
any
chance
that
he
might
find
out
i
don
t
know
she
answered
it
was
lucy
price
who
sent
me
she
came
to
my
room
just
as
i
was
lucy
price
he
repeated
the
secretary
yes
she
told
me
that
she
had
meant
to
come
to
you
herself
she
sent
me
instead
she
thought
it
best
this
man
dunster
is
being
kept
alive
because
there
is
something
miles
wants
him
to
tell
him
and
he
won
t
but
if
he
is
still
alive
if
he
won
t
tell
they
mean
to
make
away
with
him
they
are
miss
price
told
you
this
hamel
asked
gravely
fentolin
nodded
yes
she
said
so
she
knows
she
knows
everything
she
has
been
like
the
rest
of
us
she
too
has
suffered
she
too
has
reached
the
breaking
point
she
loved
him
before
the
accident
she
has
been
his
slave
ever
since
listen
she
suddenly
clutched
his
arm
they
were
both
silent
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
but
the
wind
she
leaned
a
little
closer
to
him
lucy
price
sent
me
here
because
she
was
afraid
that
it
was
they
meant
to
take
him
from
his
and
kill
him
the
police
have
left
off
searching
for
dunster
in
yarmouth
and
at
the
hague
there
is
a
detective
in
the
neighbourhood
and
another
one
on
his
way
here
they
are
afraid
to
keep
him
alive
any
where
was
fentolin
when
you
left
hamel
asked
i
asked
lucy
price
that
she
replied
when
she
came
to
my
room
there
were
no
signs
of
his
leaving
she
told
me
to
come
and
tell
you
everything
do
you
know
where
dunster
is
hamel
shook
his
head
within
a
few
yards
of
here
she
went
on
he
is
in
the
the
place
where
miles
told
you
he
kept
a
model
of
his
invention
they
brought
him
here
the
night
before
they
put
his
clothes
on
ryan
and
sent
him
off
disguised
as
dunster
in
the
car
to
hamel
started
up
but
she
clutched
at
his
arm
and
pulled
him
back
no
she
cried
you
can
t
break
in
there
are
double
doors
and
a
wonderful
lock
the
is
yours
the
building
is
yours
in
the
morning
you
must
demand
the
keys
if
he
does
not
come
and
how
are
we
to
know
hamel
asked
if
he
comes
go
outside
she
whispered
look
towards
david
s
hall
and
tell
me
how
many
lights
you
can
he
drew
back
the
bolt
unlatched
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
the
wind
and
the
driving
rain
beat
against
his
face
a
cloud
of
spray
enveloped
and
soaked
him
like
lamps
hung
in
the
sky
the
lights
of
david
s
hall
shone
out
through
the
black
gulf
he
counted
them
carefully
then
he
stepped
back
there
are
seven
he
told
her
closing
the
door
with
an
effort
she
counted
upon
her
fingers
i
must
come
and
see
she
muttered
i
must
be
sure
help
he
lifted
her
to
her
feet
and
they
staggered
out
together
look
she
went
on
gripping
his
arm
you
see
that
row
of
lights
if
anything
happens
if
fentolin
leaves
the
hall
to
come
down
here
a
light
will
appear
on
the
left
in
the
far
corner
we
must
watch
for
that
light
we
must
watch
the
words
whispered
hoarsely
into
his
ear
suddenly
died
away
even
as
they
stood
there
far
away
from
the
other
lights
another
one
shone
suddenly
out
in
the
spot
towards
which
she
had
pointed
and
continued
to
burn
steadily
he
felt
the
woman
who
was
clinging
to
his
arm
become
suddenly
a
dead
weight
she
was
right
fentolin
moaned
he
is
coming
down
he
is
preparing
to
leave
now
perhaps
he
has
already
started
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
hamel
was
conscious
of
a
gathering
sense
of
excitement
he
too
looked
at
the
signal
which
was
flashing
out
its
message
towards
them
then
he
gripped
his
companion
s
arm
and
almost
carried
her
back
into
the
look
here
he
said
firmly
you
can
do
nothing
further
you
have
done
your
part
and
done
it
well
stay
where
you
are
and
wait
the
rest
belongs
to
but
what
can
you
do
she
demanded
her
voice
shaking
with
fear
meekins
will
come
with
him
and
doctor
sarson
unless
he
is
here
already
what
can
you
do
against
them
meekins
can
break
any
ordinary
man
s
back
and
fentolin
will
have
a
hamel
threw
another
log
on
to
the
fire
and
drew
her
chair
closer
to
it
never
mind
about
he
declared
cheerfully
mr
fentolin
is
too
clever
to
attempt
violence
except
as
a
last
resource
he
knows
that
i
have
friends
in
london
who
would
need
some
explanation
of
my
disappearance
stay
here
and
she
recognised
the
note
of
authority
in
his
tone
and
she
bowed
her
head
then
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
a
changed
woman
perhaps
i
have
done
ill
to
drag
you
into
our
troubles
hamel
she
said
and
yet
i
believe
in
you
i
believe
that
you
really
care
for
esther
if
you
can
help
us
now
it
will
be
for
your
happiness
too
you
are
a
man
god
bless
you
hamel
groped
his
way
round
the
side
of
the
tower
and
took
up
a
position
at
the
extreme
corner
of
the
landward
side
of
the
building
within
a
yard
of
the
closed
doors
the
light
far
out
upon
the
left
was
still
gleaming
brightly
but
two
of
the
others
in
a
line
with
it
had
disappeared
he
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
and
waited
listening
intently
his
eyes
straining
through
the
darkness
yet
they
were
almost
upon
him
before
he
had
the
slightest
indication
of
their
presence
a
single
gleam
of
light
in
the
path
come
and
gone
like
a
flash
the
gleam
of
an
electric
torch
directed
momentarily
towards
the
road
was
his
first
indication
that
they
were
near
a
moment
or
two
later
he
heard
the
strange
click
click
of
the
little
engine
attached
to
fentolin
s
chair
hamel
set
his
teeth
and
stepped
a
few
inches
further
back
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
they
were
actually
within
a
yard
or
so
of
him
before
he
could
even
dimly
discern
their
shapes
there
were
three
of
them
fentolin
in
his
chair
doctor
sarson
and
meekins
they
paused
for
a
moment
while
the
latter
produced
a
key
hamel
distinctly
heard
a
slow
soft
whisper
from
doctor
sarson
shall
i
go
round
to
the
front
and
see
that
he
is
in
bed
no
need
fentolin
replied
calmly
it
is
nearly
four
o
clock
better
not
to
risk
the
sound
of
your
footsteps
upon
the
pebbles
now
the
door
swung
noiselessly
open
the
darkness
was
so
complete
that
even
though
hamel
could
have
touched
them
with
an
outstretched
hand
their
shapes
were
invisible
hamel
who
had
formed
no
definite
plans
had
no
time
to
hesitate
as
the
last
one
disappeared
through
the
door
he
too
slipped
in
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
left
and
holding
his
breath
stood
against
the
wall
the
door
closed
behind
them
the
gleam
of
the
electric
light
flashed
across
the
stone
floor
and
rested
for
a
moment
upon
a
which
meekins
had
already
stooped
to
lift
it
fell
back
noiselessly
upon
rubber
studs
and
meekins
immediately
slipped
through
it
a
ladder
on
either
side
of
which
was
a
grooved
stretch
of
board
evidently
fashioned
to
allow
fentolin
s
carriage
to
pass
down
hamel
held
his
breath
the
moment
for
him
was
critical
if
the
light
flashed
once
in
his
direction
he
must
be
discovered
both
meekins
and
doctor
sarson
however
were
intent
upon
the
task
of
steering
fentolin
s
little
carriage
down
below
they
placed
the
wheels
in
the
two
grooves
and
meekins
secured
the
carriage
with
a
rope
which
he
let
run
through
his
fingers
as
soon
as
the
little
vehicle
had
apparently
reached
the
bottom
he
turned
thrust
the
electric
torch
in
his
pocket
and
stepped
lightly
down
the
ladder
doctor
sarson
followed
his
example
they
disappeared
in
perfect
silence
and
left
the
door
open
presently
a
gleam
of
light
came
travelling
up
from
which
hamel
knew
that
they
had
lit
a
lamp
below
very
softly
he
crept
across
the
floor
threw
himself
upon
his
stomach
and
peered
down
below
him
was
a
room
or
rather
a
cellar
parts
of
which
seemed
to
have
been
cut
out
of
the
solid
rock
immediately
underneath
was
a
plain
iron
bedstead
on
which
was
lying
stretched
the
figure
of
a
man
in
those
first
few
moments
hamel
failed
altogether
to
recognise
dunster
he
was
thin
and
white
and
he
seemed
to
have
shrunken
his
face
with
its
coarse
growth
of
beard
seemed
like
the
face
of
an
old
man
yet
the
eyes
were
open
eyes
dull
and
heavy
as
though
with
pain
so
far
no
word
had
been
spoken
but
at
that
moment
fentolin
broke
the
silence
my
dear
guest
he
said
i
bring
you
our
most
sincere
apologies
it
has
gone
very
much
against
the
grain
i
can
assure
you
to
have
neglected
you
for
so
long
a
time
it
is
entirely
the
fault
of
the
very
troublesome
young
man
who
occupies
the
other
portion
of
this
building
in
the
daytime
his
presence
makes
it
exceedingly
difficult
for
us
to
offer
you
those
little
attentions
which
you
might
naturally
the
man
upon
the
bed
neither
moved
nor
changed
his
position
in
any
way
nor
did
he
speak
all
power
of
initiative
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
he
lay
quite
still
his
eyes
fixed
upon
fentolin
there
comes
a
time
the
latter
continued
when
every
one
of
us
is
confronted
with
what
might
be
described
as
the
crisis
of
our
lives
yours
has
come
my
guest
at
precisely
this
moment
it
is
if
my
watch
tells
me
the
truth
five
and
twenty
minutes
to
four
it
is
the
last
day
of
april
the
year
you
know
you
have
exactly
one
minute
to
decide
whether
you
will
live
a
short
time
longer
or
whether
you
will
on
this
last
day
of
april
and
before
say
a
quarter
to
four
make
that
little
journey
the
nature
of
which
you
and
i
have
discussed
more
than
still
the
man
upon
the
bed
made
no
movement
nor
any
reply
fentolin
sighed
and
beckoned
to
doctor
sarson
i
am
afraid
he
whispered
that
that
wonderful
drug
of
yours
doctor
has
been
even
a
little
too
in
its
results
it
has
kept
our
friend
so
quiet
that
he
has
lost
even
the
power
of
speech
perhaps
even
the
desire
to
speak
a
little
restorative
i
think
just
a
few
doctor
sarson
nodded
silently
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
phial
and
poured
into
a
which
stood
on
a
table
by
the
side
of
the
bed
half
a
dozen
drops
of
some
liquid
to
which
he
added
a
tablespoonful
of
water
then
he
leaned
once
more
over
the
bed
and
poured
the
contents
of
the
glass
between
the
lips
of
the
man
give
him
two
minutes
he
said
calmly
he
will
be
able
to
speak
fentolin
nodded
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
he
glanced
around
the
room
a
little
critically
there
was
a
thick
carpet
upon
the
floor
a
sofa
piled
with
cushions
in
one
corner
and
several
other
articles
of
furniture
the
walls
however
were
uncovered
and
were
stained
with
damp
a
great
pink
fungus
stood
out
within
a
few
inches
of
the
bed
a
grim
mixture
of
exquisite
colouring
and
loathsome
imperfections
the
atmosphere
was
fetid
meekins
suddenly
struck
a
match
and
lit
some
grains
of
powder
in
a
saucer
a
curious
odour
of
incense
stole
through
the
place
fentolin
nodded
appreciatively
that
is
better
he
declared
really
the
atmosphere
here
is
positively
unpleasant
i
am
ashamed
to
think
that
our
guest
has
had
to
put
up
with
it
so
long
and
yet
he
went
on
i
think
we
must
call
it
his
own
fault
i
trust
that
he
will
no
longer
be
the
effect
of
the
restorative
began
to
show
itself
the
man
on
the
bed
moved
restlessly
his
eyes
were
no
longer
altogether
expressionless
he
was
staring
at
fentolin
as
one
looks
at
some
horrible
vision
fentolin
smiled
pleasantly
now
you
are
looking
more
like
your
old
self
my
dear
dunster
he
remarked
i
don
t
think
that
i
need
repeat
what
i
said
when
i
first
came
need
i
you
have
just
to
utter
that
one
word
and
your
little
visit
to
us
will
be
at
an
the
man
looked
around
at
all
of
them
he
raised
himself
a
little
on
his
elbow
for
the
first
time
hamel
crouching
above
recognised
any
likeness
to
john
dunster
i
ll
see
you
in
hell
first
fentolin
s
face
momentarily
darkened
he
moved
a
little
nearer
to
the
man
upon
the
bed
dunster
he
said
i
am
in
grim
earnest
never
mind
arguments
never
mind
why
i
am
on
the
other
side
they
are
restless
about
you
in
america
unless
i
can
cable
that
word
morning
they
ll
communicate
direct
with
the
hague
and
i
shall
have
had
my
trouble
for
nothing
it
is
not
my
custom
to
put
up
with
failure
therefore
let
me
tell
you
that
no
single
one
of
my
threats
has
been
exaggerated
my
patience
has
reached
its
breaking
point
give
me
that
word
or
before
four
o
clock
strikes
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
new
chamber
among
the
corpses
of
those
misguided
fishermen
mariners
of
ancient
days
and
a
few
others
it
s
only
a
matter
of
fifty
yards
out
to
the
great
sea
pit
below
the
dagger
rocks
i
ve
spoken
to
you
about
it
before
haven
t
i
so
surely
as
i
speak
to
you
of
it
at
this
fentolin
s
speech
came
to
an
abrupt
termination
a
convulsive
movement
of
meekins
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
on
the
part
of
doctor
sarson
had
suddenly
checked
the
words
upon
his
lips
he
turned
his
head
quickly
in
the
direction
towards
which
they
had
been
gazing
towards
which
in
fact
at
that
moment
meekins
with
a
low
cry
had
made
a
fruitless
spring
the
ladder
down
which
they
had
descended
was
slowly
disappearing
meekins
with
a
jump
missed
the
last
rung
by
only
a
few
inches
some
unseen
hand
was
drawing
it
up
already
the
last
few
feet
were
vanishing
in
fentolin
sat
quite
quiet
and
still
he
looked
through
the
and
saw
hamel
most
ingenious
and
i
must
confess
most
successful
my
young
friend
he
exclaimed
pleasantly
when
you
have
made
the
ladder
quite
secure
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
discuss
this
little
matter
with
us
there
was
no
immediate
reply
the
eyes
of
all
four
men
were
turned
now
upon
that
empty
space
through
which
the
ladder
had
finally
disappeared
fentolin
s
fingers
disappeared
within
the
pocket
of
his
coat
something
very
bright
was
glistening
in
his
hand
when
he
withdrew
it
come
and
parley
with
us
hamel
he
begged
you
will
not
find
us
hamel
s
voice
came
back
in
reply
but
hamel
himself
kept
well
away
from
the
opening
the
conditions
he
said
are
unpropitious
a
little
time
for
reflection
will
do
you
no
the
were
suddenly
closed
fentolin
s
face
as
he
looked
up
became
diabolic
we
are
trapped
he
muttered
caught
like
rats
in
a
hole
chapter
xxxiii
a
gleam
of
day
was
in
the
sky
as
hamel
with
fentolin
by
his
side
passed
along
the
path
which
led
from
the
tower
to
david
s
hall
lights
were
still
burning
from
its
windows
the
outline
of
the
building
itself
was
faintly
defined
against
the
sky
behind
him
across
the
sea
was
that
one
straight
line
of
grey
merging
into
silver
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
wind
had
dropped
on
either
side
of
them
stretched
the
brimming
creeks
can
we
get
into
the
house
without
waking
any
one
he
asked
quite
easily
she
assured
him
the
front
door
is
never
she
walked
by
his
side
swiftly
and
with
surprising
vigour
in
the
still
grey
light
her
face
was
more
ghastly
than
ever
but
there
was
a
new
firmness
about
her
mouth
a
new
decision
in
her
tone
they
reached
the
hall
without
further
speech
and
she
led
the
way
to
a
small
door
on
the
eastern
side
through
which
they
entered
noiselessly
and
passed
along
a
little
passage
out
into
the
hall
a
couple
of
lights
were
still
burning
the
place
seemed
full
of
shadows
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
whispered
i
want
to
ring
up
london
on
the
telephone
he
replied
i
know
that
there
is
a
detective
either
in
the
neighbourhood
or
on
his
way
here
but
i
shall
tell
my
friend
that
he
had
better
come
down
she
nodded
i
am
going
to
release
esther
she
said
she
is
locked
in
her
room
the
telephone
is
in
the
study
i
will
come
down
there
to
she
passed
silently
up
the
broad
staircase
hamel
groped
his
way
across
the
hall
into
the
library
he
turned
on
the
small
electric
and
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
side
of
the
telephone
even
as
he
lifted
the
receiver
to
his
ear
he
looked
around
him
half
apprehensively
it
seemed
as
though
every
moment
he
would
hear
the
click
of
fentolin
s
chair
he
got
the
exchange
at
norwich
without
difficulty
and
a
few
minutes
later
a
sleepy
reply
came
from
the
number
he
had
rung
up
in
london
it
was
kinsley
s
servant
who
answered
i
want
to
speak
to
kinsley
at
once
upon
most
important
business
hamel
announced
very
sorry
sir
the
man
repelled
mr
kinsley
left
town
last
night
for
the
where
has
he
gone
hamel
demanded
quickly
you
can
tell
me
you
know
who
i
am
i
am
into
norfolk
somewhere
sir
he
went
with
several
other
is
that
bullen
hamel
asked
the
man
admitted
the
fact
can
you
tell
me
if
any
of
the
people
with
whom
kinsley
left
london
were
connected
with
the
police
he
inquired
the
man
hesitated
i
believe
so
sir
he
admitted
the
gentlemen
started
in
a
and
were
going
to
drive
all
hamel
laid
down
the
receiver
at
any
rate
he
would
not
be
left
long
with
this
responsibility
upon
him
he
walked
out
into
the
hall
the
house
was
still
wrapped
in
deep
silence
then
from
somewhere
above
him
coming
down
the
stairs
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
woman
s
gown
he
looked
up
and
saw
miss
price
fully
dressed
coming
slowly
towards
him
she
held
up
her
finger
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
library
she
was
dressed
as
neatly
as
ever
but
there
was
a
queer
light
in
her
eyes
i
have
seen
seymour
fentolin
she
said
she
tells
me
that
you
have
left
fentolin
and
the
others
in
the
subterranean
room
of
the
hamel
nodded
they
have
dunster
down
there
he
told
her
i
followed
them
in
it
seemed
the
best
thing
to
do
i
have
a
friend
from
london
who
is
on
his
way
down
here
now
with
some
detective
officers
to
enquire
into
the
matter
of
dunster
s
are
you
going
to
leave
them
where
they
are
until
these
people
arrive
she
asked
i
think
so
he
replied
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
don
t
seem
to
have
had
time
to
consider
even
what
to
do
the
opportunity
came
and
i
embraced
it
there
they
are
and
they
won
t
dare
to
do
any
further
harm
to
dunster
now
fentolin
was
down
in
my
room
and
i
thought
it
best
to
bring
her
back
first
before
i
even
parleyed
with
them
you
must
be
careful
she
advised
slowly
the
man
dunster
has
been
drugged
he
has
lost
some
of
his
will
he
may
have
lost
some
of
his
mental
balance
fentolin
is
clever
he
will
find
a
dozen
ways
to
wriggle
out
of
any
charge
that
can
be
brought
against
him
you
know
what
he
has
really
done
i
can
he
has
kept
back
a
document
signed
by
the
twelve
men
in
america
who
control
the
whole
of
wall
street
who
control
practically
the
money
markets
of
the
world
that
document
is
a
warning
to
germany
that
they
will
have
no
war
against
england
owing
to
fentolin
it
has
not
been
delivered
and
the
conference
is
sitting
now
war
may
be
declared
at
any
but
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
hamel
asked
why
does
fentolin
desire
war
you
do
not
understand
fentolin
she
told
him
quietly
he
is
not
like
other
men
there
are
some
who
live
almost
entirely
for
the
sake
of
making
others
happy
who
find
joy
in
seeing
people
content
and
satisfied
fentolin
is
the
reverse
of
this
he
has
but
one
craving
in
life
to
see
pain
in
others
to
see
a
human
being
suffer
is
to
him
a
debauch
of
happiness
a
war
which
laid
this
country
waste
would
fill
him
with
a
delight
which
you
could
never
understand
there
are
no
normal
human
beings
like
this
it
is
a
disease
in
the
man
a
disease
which
came
upon
him
after
his
yet
you
have
all
been
his
slaves
hamel
said
curiously
we
have
all
been
his
slaves
she
admitted
for
different
reasons
before
his
accident
came
fentolin
was
my
master
and
the
only
man
in
the
world
for
me
after
his
accident
i
think
my
feelings
for
him
if
anything
grew
stronger
i
became
his
slave
i
sold
my
conscience
my
everything
in
life
worth
having
to
bring
a
smile
to
his
lips
to
help
him
through
a
single
moment
of
his
misery
and
just
lately
the
reaction
has
come
he
has
played
with
me
just
as
he
would
sit
and
pull
the
legs
out
of
a
spider
to
watch
its
agony
i
have
been
one
of
his
favourite
amusements
and
even
now
if
he
came
into
this
room
i
think
that
i
should
be
helpless
i
should
probably
fall
at
his
feet
and
pray
for
hamel
looked
at
her
wonderingly
i
have
come
down
to
warn
you
she
went
on
it
is
possible
that
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
end
that
his
wonderful
fortune
will
desert
him
that
his
star
has
gone
down
but
remember
that
he
has
the
brains
and
courage
of
genius
you
think
that
you
have
him
in
a
trap
don
t
be
surprised
when
you
go
back
to
find
that
he
has
turned
the
tables
upon
impossible
hamel
declared
i
looked
all
round
the
place
there
isn
t
a
window
or
opening
anywhere
the
is
in
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
and
it
is
fifteen
feet
from
the
floor
it
shuts
with
a
it
may
be
as
you
say
she
observed
it
may
be
that
he
is
safe
remember
though
if
you
go
near
him
that
he
is
do
you
know
where
miss
fentolin
is
he
interrupted
she
is
with
her
mother
the
woman
replied
impatiently
she
is
coming
down
tell
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
fentolin
nothing
else
i
have
a
friend
hamel
answered
who
will
see
to
if
you
are
relying
upon
the
law
she
said
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
law
can
not
touch
him
dunster
was
brought
to
the
house
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
he
was
certainly
injured
and
injured
in
a
railway
accident
doctor
sarson
is
a
fully
qualified
surgeon
and
he
will
declare
that
dunster
was
unfit
to
travel
if
necessary
they
will
have
destroyed
the
man
s
intelligence
if
you
think
that
you
have
him
broken
let
me
warn
you
that
you
may
be
disappointed
let
me
if
i
may
give
you
one
word
of
please
do
hamel
begged
she
looked
at
him
coldly
her
tone
was
still
free
from
any
sort
of
emotion
you
have
taken
up
some
sort
of
position
here
she
continued
as
a
friend
of
seymour
fentolin
a
friend
of
the
family
don
t
let
them
come
back
under
the
yoke
you
know
the
secret
of
their
bondage
i
know
it
he
admitted
they
have
been
his
slaves
because
their
absolute
obedience
to
his
will
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
secrecy
he
has
drawn
the
cords
too
tight
better
let
the
truth
be
known
if
needs
be
than
have
their
three
lives
broken
don
t
let
them
go
back
under
his
governance
for
me
i
can
not
tell
if
he
comes
back
as
he
will
come
back
i
may
become
his
slave
again
but
let
them
break
away
listen
that
is
she
left
him
hamel
followed
her
out
into
the
hall
esther
and
her
mother
were
already
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
drew
them
into
the
study
esther
gave
him
her
hands
but
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
i
am
terrified
she
whispered
every
moment
i
think
i
can
hear
the
click
of
that
awful
carriage
he
will
come
back
i
am
sure
he
will
come
back
he
may
hamel
answered
sturdily
but
never
to
make
you
people
his
slaves
again
you
have
done
enough
you
have
earned
your
i
agree
fentolin
said
firmly
we
have
gone
on
from
sacrifice
to
sacrifice
until
it
has
become
a
habit
with
us
to
consider
him
the
master
of
our
bodies
and
our
souls
esther
we
have
reached
the
breaking
point
not
even
for
the
sake
of
that
message
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
not
even
to
preserve
his
honour
and
his
memory
can
we
do
hamel
held
up
his
finger
he
opened
the
french
windows
and
they
followed
him
out
on
to
the
terrace
the
grey
dawn
had
broken
now
over
the
sea
there
were
gleams
of
fitful
sunshine
on
the
marshes
some
distance
away
a
large
was
coming
rapidly
along
the
road
chapter
xxxiv
john
dunster
lying
flat
upon
his
little
bed
watched
with
dilated
eyes
the
disappearance
of
the
ladder
then
he
laughed
it
was
a
queer
sound
broken
spasmodic
devoid
of
any
of
the
ordinary
elements
of
humor
and
yet
it
was
a
laugh
fentolin
turned
his
head
towards
his
prisoner
and
nodded
thoughtfully
what
a
constitution
my
friend
he
exclaimed
without
any
trace
of
disturbance
in
his
voice
and
what
a
sense
of
humour
strange
that
a
trifling
circumstance
like
this
should
affect
it
meekins
burn
some
more
of
the
powder
the
atmosphere
down
here
may
be
salubrious
but
i
am
unaccustomed
to
perhaps
dunster
said
in
a
hollow
tone
you
will
have
some
opportunity
now
of
discovering
with
me
what
it
is
that
too
is
just
possible
fentolin
admitted
blowing
out
a
little
volume
of
smoke
from
a
cigarette
which
he
had
just
lit
but
one
never
knows
we
have
friends
and
our
position
although
i
must
admit
a
little
ridiculous
is
easily
remedied
but
how
that
hamel
could
have
found
his
way
into
the
does
i
must
confess
perplex
he
must
have
been
hanging
around
and
followed
us
in
when
we
came
meekins
muttered
somehow
i
fancied
i
felt
some
one
our
young
friend
fentolin
continued
has
without
doubt
an
obvious
turn
of
mind
he
will
send
for
his
acquaintance
in
the
foreign
office
they
will
haul
out
dunster
here
and
he
will
have
a
belated
opportunity
of
delivering
his
message
at
the
you
aren
t
going
to
murder
me
first
then
dunster
grunted
fentolin
smiled
at
him
benignly
my
dear
and
valued
guest
he
protested
why
so
forbidding
an
idea
let
me
assure
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
any
bodily
harm
to
you
is
the
most
unlikely
thing
in
the
world
you
see
though
you
might
not
think
it
he
went
on
i
love
life
that
is
why
i
keep
a
doctor
always
by
my
side
that
is
why
i
insist
upon
his
making
a
complete
study
of
my
constitution
and
treating
me
in
every
respect
as
though
i
were
indeed
an
invalid
i
am
really
only
years
old
it
is
my
intention
to
live
until
i
am
an
offence
against
the
law
of
the
nature
you
indicate
might
interfere
materially
with
my
dunster
struggled
for
a
moment
for
breath
look
here
he
said
that
s
all
right
but
do
you
suppose
you
won
t
be
punished
for
what
you
ve
done
to
me
you
laid
a
deliberate
plot
to
bring
me
to
david
s
hall
you
ve
kept
me
locked
up
dosed
me
with
drugs
brought
me
down
here
at
the
dead
of
night
kept
me
a
prisoner
in
a
dungeon
do
you
think
you
can
do
that
for
nothing
do
you
think
you
won
t
have
to
suffer
for
it
fentolin
smiled
my
dear
dunster
he
reminded
him
you
were
in
a
railway
accident
you
know
there
is
no
possible
doubt
about
that
and
the
wound
in
your
head
is
still
there
in
a
very
dangerous
place
men
who
have
been
in
railway
accidents
and
who
have
a
gaping
wound
very
close
to
their
brain
are
subject
to
delusions
i
have
simply
done
my
best
to
play
the
good
samaritan
your
clothes
and
papers
are
all
untouched
if
my
eminent
physician
had
pronounced
you
ready
to
travel
a
week
ago
you
would
certainly
have
been
allowed
to
depart
a
week
ago
any
interference
in
your
movements
has
been
entirely
in
the
interests
of
your
dunster
tried
to
sit
up
but
found
himself
unable
so
you
think
they
won
t
believe
my
story
eh
he
muttered
well
we
shall
fentolin
thoughtfully
contemplated
the
burning
end
of
his
cigarette
for
a
moment
if
i
believed
he
said
that
there
was
any
chance
of
your
statements
being
accepted
i
am
afraid
i
should
be
compelled
in
all
our
interests
to
ask
doctor
sarson
to
pursue
just
a
step
further
that
experiment
into
the
anatomy
of
your
brain
with
which
he
has
already
dunster
s
face
was
suddenly
ghastly
his
reserve
of
strength
seemed
to
ebb
away
the
memory
of
some
horrible
moment
seemed
to
hold
him
in
its
clutches
for
god
s
sake
leave
me
alone
he
moaned
let
me
get
away
that
s
all
let
me
crawl
away
ah
fentolin
murmured
that
sounds
much
more
reasonable
when
you
talk
like
that
my
friend
i
feel
indeed
that
there
is
hope
for
you
let
us
abandon
this
subject
for
the
present
have
you
solved
the
puzzle
yet
he
asked
meekins
meekins
was
standing
below
the
closed
he
had
already
dragged
up
a
wooden
case
underneath
and
was
piling
it
with
various
articles
of
furniture
not
yet
sir
he
replied
when
i
have
made
this
steadier
i
am
just
going
to
see
what
pressure
i
can
bring
to
bear
on
the
i
heard
the
bolts
go
doctor
sarson
remarked
uneasily
in
that
case
fentolin
declared
it
will
indeed
be
an
interesting
test
of
our
friend
meekins
boasted
strength
meekins
holds
his
place
a
very
desirable
place
too
chiefly
for
two
reasons
first
his
discretion
and
secondly
his
muscles
he
has
never
before
had
a
real
opportunity
of
testing
the
latter
we
shall
doctor
sarson
came
slowly
and
gravely
to
the
bedside
he
looked
down
upon
his
patient
dunster
shivered
i
am
not
sure
sir
he
said
very
softly
that
dunster
in
his
present
state
of
mind
is
a
very
safe
person
to
be
allowed
his
freedom
it
is
true
that
we
have
kept
him
here
for
his
own
sake
because
of
his
fits
of
mental
wandering
our
statements
however
may
be
doubted
an
apparent
return
to
sanity
on
his
part
may
lend
colour
to
his
accusations
especially
if
permanent
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
pursue
that
investigation
a
shade
further
a
touch
more
to
the
left
and
i
do
not
think
that
dunster
will
remember
much
in
this
world
likely
to
affect
dunster
s
face
was
like
marble
there
were
beads
of
perspiration
upon
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
filled
with
reminiscent
horror
fentolin
bent
over
him
with
genuine
interest
what
a
picture
he
would
make
he
murmured
what
a
drama
do
you
know
i
am
half
inclined
to
agree
with
you
sarson
the
only
trouble
is
that
you
have
not
your
instruments
i
could
improvise
something
that
would
do
the
trick
the
doctor
said
thoughtfully
it
really
isn
t
a
complicated
affair
it
seems
to
me
that
his
story
may
gain
credence
from
the
very
fact
of
our
being
discovered
in
this
extraordinary
place
to
have
moved
him
here
was
a
mistake
perhaps
so
fentolin
admitted
with
a
sigh
it
was
our
young
friend
hamel
who
was
responsible
for
it
i
fancied
him
arriving
with
a
search
warrant
at
any
moment
we
will
bear
in
mind
your
suggestion
for
a
few
minutes
let
us
watch
meekins
this
promises
to
be
by
dint
of
piling
together
all
the
furniture
in
the
place
the
man
was
now
able
to
reach
the
he
pressed
upon
it
vigorously
without
even
bending
the
wood
fentolin
smiled
pleasantly
meekins
he
said
look
at
the
man
turned
and
faced
his
master
his
aspect
of
dogged
civility
had
never
been
more
apparent
now
listen
fentolin
went
on
i
want
to
remind
you
of
certain
things
meekins
we
are
among
friends
here
no
secrecy
you
understand
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
need
not
be
afraid
you
know
how
you
came
to
me
you
remember
that
little
affair
of
anna
jayes
in
hartlepool
the
face
of
the
man
was
filled
with
terror
he
began
to
tremble
where
he
stood
fentolin
played
for
a
moment
with
his
collar
as
though
he
found
it
tight
such
a
chance
it
was
my
dear
meekins
fentolin
continued
cheerfully
which
brought
me
that
little
scrap
of
knowledge
concerning
you
it
has
bought
me
through
all
these
years
a
good
deal
of
faithful
service
i
am
not
ungrateful
believe
me
i
intend
to
retain
you
for
my
and
to
keep
my
lips
sealed
for
a
great
many
years
to
come
now
remember
what
i
have
said
when
we
leave
this
place
that
little
episode
will
steal
back
into
a
far
corner
of
my
mind
i
shall
in
short
forget
it
if
we
are
caught
here
and
inconvenience
follows
well
i
can
not
say
do
your
best
meekins
do
a
little
better
than
your
best
you
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
strong
man
let
us
see
you
justify
the
man
took
a
long
breath
and
returned
to
his
task
his
shoulders
and
arms
were
upon
the
door
he
began
to
strain
he
grew
red
in
the
face
the
veins
across
his
forehead
stood
out
blue
like
string
his
complexion
became
purple
through
his
open
mouth
his
breath
came
in
short
pants
with
every
muscle
of
his
body
and
neck
he
strained
and
strained
the
woodwork
gave
a
little
but
it
never
even
cracked
with
a
sob
he
suddenly
almost
collapsed
fentolin
looked
at
him
frowning
very
good
very
good
meekins
he
said
but
not
quite
good
enough
you
are
a
trifle
out
of
practice
perhaps
take
your
breath
take
time
remember
that
you
have
another
chance
i
am
not
angry
with
you
meekins
i
know
there
are
many
enterprises
upon
which
one
does
not
succeed
the
first
time
get
your
breath
there
is
no
hurry
next
time
you
try
see
that
you
succeed
it
is
very
important
meekins
for
you
as
well
as
for
us
that
you
the
man
turned
doggedly
back
to
his
task
the
eyes
of
the
three
men
watched
him
dunster
on
the
bed
doctor
sarson
pale
and
gloomy
with
something
of
fear
in
his
dark
eyes
and
fentolin
himself
whose
expression
seemed
to
be
one
of
purely
benevolent
and
encouraging
interest
once
more
the
face
of
the
man
became
almost
unrecognisable
there
was
a
great
crack
the
had
shifted
meekins
with
a
little
cry
reeled
and
sank
backwards
fentolin
clapped
his
hands
lightly
really
meekins
he
declared
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
enjoyed
any
performance
so
much
i
feel
as
if
i
were
back
in
the
days
of
the
roman
gladiators
i
can
see
that
you
mean
to
succeed
you
will
succeed
you
do
not
mean
to
end
your
days
amid
objectionable
with
the
air
of
a
man
temporarily
mad
meekins
went
back
to
his
task
he
was
sobbing
to
himself
now
his
clothes
had
burst
away
from
him
suddenly
there
was
a
crash
the
hinges
of
the
had
parted
with
the
blood
streaming
from
a
wound
in
his
forehead
meekins
staggered
back
to
his
feet
fentolin
nodded
excellent
he
pronounced
really
excellent
with
a
little
assistance
from
our
friend
meekins
you
i
am
sure
sarson
will
now
be
able
to
climb
up
and
let
down
the
doctor
sarson
stood
by
fentolin
s
chair
and
together
they
looked
up
through
the
fragments
of
the
meekins
was
still
breathing
heavily
suddenly
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
sharp
report
as
of
a
door
above
being
slammed
some
one
was
in
the
when
i
broke
the
meekins
muttered
i
heard
them
moving
fentolin
frowned
then
let
us
hurry
he
said
sarson
what
about
your
patient
dunster
was
lying
upon
his
side
watching
them
the
doctor
went
over
to
the
bedside
and
felt
his
pulse
and
head
he
will
do
for
twelve
hours
he
pronounced
if
you
think
that
other
little
operation
he
broke
off
and
looked
at
fentolin
meaningly
the
man
on
the
bed
shrank
back
his
eyes
lit
with
horror
fentolin
smiled
pleasantly
i
fear
he
said
that
we
must
not
stay
for
that
just
now
a
little
later
on
perhaps
if
it
becomes
necessary
let
us
first
attend
to
the
business
on
meekins
once
more
clambered
on
to
the
little
heap
of
furniture
the
doctor
stood
by
his
side
for
a
moment
then
with
an
effort
he
was
hoisted
up
until
he
could
catch
hold
of
the
floor
of
the
outhouse
meekins
gave
one
push
and
he
disappeared
any
one
up
there
fentolin
enquired
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
his
tone
no
one
the
doctor
reported
has
anything
been
disturbed
doctor
sarson
was
some
little
time
before
he
replied
yes
he
said
some
one
seems
to
have
been
rummaging
send
down
the
steps
quickly
fentolin
ordered
i
am
beginning
to
find
the
atmosphere
here
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
ladder
being
dragged
across
the
floor
and
a
moment
or
two
later
it
was
carefully
lowered
and
placed
in
position
fentolin
passed
the
rope
through
the
front
of
his
carriage
and
was
drawn
up
from
his
bed
dunster
watched
them
go
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
he
was
relieved
or
disappointed
who
has
been
in
here
fentolin
demanded
as
he
looked
around
the
place
there
was
no
reply
a
grey
twilight
was
struggling
now
through
the
high
windows
meekins
who
had
gone
on
towards
the
door
suddenly
called
out
some
one
has
taken
away
the
key
the
door
is
locked
on
the
other
side
fentolin
s
frown
was
malign
even
for
him
our
dear
friend
hamel
i
suppose
he
muttered
another
little
debt
we
shall
owe
him
try
the
other
meekins
moved
towards
the
partition
suddenly
he
paused
fentolin
s
hand
was
outstretched
he
too
was
listening
above
the
low
thunder
of
the
sea
came
another
sound
a
sound
which
at
that
moment
they
none
of
them
probably
understood
there
was
the
steady
crashing
of
feet
upon
the
pebbles
a
low
murmur
of
voices
fentolin
for
the
first
time
showed
symptoms
of
fear
try
the
other
door
quickly
he
directed
meekins
came
back
shaking
his
head
outside
the
noise
seemed
to
be
increasing
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
hannah
cox
stood
outside
in
her
plain
black
dress
her
hair
her
eyes
aflame
she
held
the
key
in
her
fingers
and
she
looked
in
upon
them
her
lips
seemed
to
move
but
she
said
nothing
my
good
woman
fentolin
exclaimed
frowning
are
you
the
person
who
removed
that
key
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
chair
she
took
no
notice
of
the
other
two
come
she
said
there
is
something
here
i
want
you
to
listen
to
come
chapter
xxxv
fentolin
arrived
outside
on
the
stone
front
of
the
pointed
the
wheel
of
his
chair
towards
the
hall
hannah
cox
who
kept
by
his
side
however
drew
it
gently
towards
the
beach
down
here
she
directed
softly
bring
your
chair
down
the
close
to
the
water
s
my
good
woman
fentolin
exclaimed
furiously
i
am
not
in
the
humour
for
this
sort
of
thing
lock
up
sarson
at
once
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
get
but
you
will
come
just
this
little
way
she
continued
speaking
without
any
change
of
tone
you
see
the
others
are
waiting
too
i
have
been
down
to
the
village
and
fetched
them
fentolin
followed
her
outstretched
finger
and
gave
a
sudden
start
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
were
a
dozen
or
twenty
fishermen
they
were
all
muttering
together
and
looking
at
the
top
of
the
as
he
realised
the
direction
of
their
gaze
fentolin
s
face
underwent
a
strange
transformation
he
seemed
to
shrink
in
his
chair
he
was
ghastly
pale
even
to
the
lips
slowly
he
turned
his
head
from
a
place
in
the
roof
of
the
a
tall
support
had
appeared
on
the
top
was
a
swinging
globe
what
have
you
to
do
with
that
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
found
it
she
answered
i
felt
that
it
was
there
i
have
brought
them
up
with
me
to
see
it
i
think
that
they
want
to
ask
you
some
questions
but
first
come
and
fentolin
shook
her
off
he
looked
around
for
meekins
meekins
stand
by
my
chair
he
ordered
sharply
turn
round
i
wish
to
go
to
the
hall
drive
this
woman
meekins
came
hurrying
up
but
almost
at
the
same
moment
half
a
dozen
of
the
brown
jerseyed
fishermen
detached
themselves
from
the
others
they
formed
a
little
bodyguard
around
the
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
fentolin
demanded
his
voice
shrill
with
anger
didn
t
you
hear
what
i
said
this
woman
annoys
me
send
her
not
one
of
the
fishermen
answered
a
word
or
made
the
slightest
movement
to
obey
him
one
of
them
a
veteran
drew
the
chair
a
little
further
down
the
planked
way
across
the
pebbles
hannah
cox
kept
close
to
its
side
they
came
to
a
standstill
only
a
few
yards
from
where
the
waves
were
breaking
she
lifted
her
hand
listen
she
cried
listen
fentolin
turned
helplessly
around
the
little
group
of
fishermen
had
closed
in
upon
sarson
and
meekins
the
woman
s
hand
was
upon
his
shoulder
she
pointed
seaward
to
where
a
hissing
line
of
white
foam
marked
the
spot
where
the
topmost
of
the
rocks
were
visible
you
wondered
why
i
have
spent
so
much
of
my
time
out
here
she
said
quietly
now
you
will
know
if
you
listen
as
i
am
listening
as
i
have
listened
for
so
many
weary
hours
so
many
weary
years
you
will
hear
them
calling
to
me
david
and
john
and
stephen
the
light
do
you
hear
what
they
are
crying
the
light
fentolin
s
light
look
she
forced
him
to
look
once
more
at
the
top
of
the
they
were
right
she
proclaimed
her
voice
gaining
in
strength
and
intensity
they
were
neither
drunk
nor
reckless
they
steered
as
straight
as
human
hand
could
guide
a
tiller
for
fentolin
s
light
and
there
they
are
calling
and
calling
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
my
three
boys
and
my
man
do
you
know
for
whom
they
call
fentolin
shrank
back
in
his
chair
take
this
woman
away
he
ordered
the
fishermen
do
you
hear
take
her
away
she
is
mad
they
looked
towards
him
but
not
one
of
them
moved
fentolin
raised
his
whistle
to
his
lips
and
blew
it
meekins
he
cried
where
are
you
meekins
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
at
once
that
meekins
was
powerless
five
or
six
of
the
fishermen
had
gathered
around
him
there
were
at
least
thirty
of
them
about
sinewy
powerful
men
the
only
person
who
moved
towards
fentolin
s
carriage
was
jacob
the
coast
guardsman
mr
fentolin
sir
he
said
the
lads
have
got
your
bully
safe
it
s
a
year
and
more
that
hannah
cox
has
been
about
the
village
with
some
story
about
two
lights
on
a
stormy
night
it
s
true
what
she
says
that
her
man
and
boys
lie
drowned
there
s
william
green
besides
and
a
nephew
of
my
own
john
kallender
and
philip
green
he
was
saved
he
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
that
he
steered
straight
for
the
light
when
his
boat
struck
and
that
as
he
swam
for
shore
five
minutes
later
he
saw
the
light
reappear
in
another
place
it
s
a
strange
story
what
have
you
to
say
sir
about
that
he
pointed
straight
to
the
globe
which
towered
on
its
slender
support
above
the
fentolin
looked
at
it
and
looked
back
at
the
coast
guardsman
the
brain
of
a
machiavelli
could
scarcely
have
invented
a
plausible
reply
the
light
was
never
lit
there
he
said
it
was
simply
to
help
me
in
some
electrical
then
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
those
who
were
looking
on
saw
fentolin
apart
from
his
carriage
without
any
haste
but
with
amazing
strength
hannah
cox
leaned
over
and
with
her
arms
around
his
middle
lifted
him
sheer
up
into
the
air
she
carried
him
clasped
in
her
arms
a
weird
struggling
object
to
the
clumsy
boat
that
lay
always
at
the
top
of
the
beach
she
dropped
him
into
the
bottom
took
her
seat
and
unshipped
the
oars
for
one
moment
the
coast
guardsman
hesitated
then
he
obeyed
her
look
he
gave
the
boat
a
push
which
sent
it
grinding
down
the
pebbles
into
the
sea
the
woman
began
to
work
at
the
oars
every
now
and
then
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
that
thin
line
of
white
surf
which
they
were
all
the
time
approaching
what
are
you
doing
woman
fentolin
demanded
hoarsely
listen
it
was
an
accident
that
your
people
were
drowned
i
ll
give
you
an
annuity
i
ll
make
you
rich
for
life
rich
do
you
understand
what
that
means
aye
she
answered
looking
down
upon
him
as
he
lay
doubled
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
know
what
it
means
to
be
rich
better
than
you
maybe
not
to
let
the
gold
and
silver
pieces
fall
through
your
fingers
or
to
live
in
a
great
house
and
be
waited
upon
by
servants
who
desert
you
in
the
hour
of
need
that
isn
t
being
rich
it
s
rich
to
feel
the
touch
of
the
one
you
love
to
see
the
faces
around
of
those
you
ve
given
birth
to
to
move
on
through
the
days
and
nights
towards
the
end
with
them
around
not
to
know
the
chill
loneliness
of
an
empty
life
i
am
a
poor
woman
fentolin
and
it
s
your
hand
that
made
me
so
and
not
all
the
miracles
that
the
bible
ever
told
of
can
make
me
rich
you
are
a
fool
he
shrieked
you
can
buy
forgetfulness
the
memory
of
everything
i
may
be
a
fool
she
retorted
grimly
and
you
the
wise
man
but
this
day
we
ll
both
know
the
there
was
a
little
murmur
from
the
shore
where
the
fishermen
stood
in
a
long
line
bring
him
back
missus
jacob
called
out
you
ve
scared
him
enough
bring
him
back
we
ll
leave
him
to
the
they
were
close
to
the
line
of
surf
now
they
had
passed
it
indeed
a
little
on
the
left
and
the
boat
was
drifting
she
stood
up
straight
and
stern
and
her
face
as
she
looked
towards
the
land
was
lit
with
the
fire
of
the
prophetess
aye
she
cried
we
ll
leave
him
to
the
law
to
the
law
of
god
then
they
saw
her
stoop
down
and
once
more
with
that
almost
superhuman
strength
which
seemed
to
belong
to
her
for
those
few
moments
she
lifted
the
strange
object
who
lay
cowering
there
high
above
her
head
from
the
shore
they
realised
what
was
going
to
happen
and
a
great
shout
arose
she
stood
on
the
side
of
the
boat
and
jumped
holding
her
burden
tightly
in
her
arms
so
they
went
down
and
disappeared
half
a
dozen
of
the
younger
fishermen
were
in
the
water
even
before
the
grim
spectacle
was
ended
another
ran
for
a
boat
that
was
moored
a
little
way
down
the
beach
but
from
the
first
the
search
was
useless
only
jacob
who
was
a
person
afflicted
with
many
superstitions
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
as
he
leaned
over
the
bow
of
his
boat
and
looked
down
into
that
fathomless
space
i
heard
her
singing
her
or
her
wraith
he
swore
afterwards
i
ll
never
forget
the
moment
i
looked
down
and
down
and
the
water
seemed
to
grow
clearer
and
i
saw
her
walking
there
at
the
bottom
among
the
rocks
with
him
over
her
back
singing
as
she
went
looking
everywhere

and
the
boys
but
if
indeed
his
eyes
were
touched
with
fire
at
that
moment
no
one
else
in

world
saw
anything

chapter
xxxvi
john
dunster
removed
the
cigar
from
his
teeth
and
gazed
at
the
long
white
ash
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
he
was
stretched
in
a
long
chair
high
up
in
the
terraced
gardens
behind
the
hall
at
his
feet
were
golden
mats
of
yellow
crocuses
long
borders
of
hyacinths
pink
and
purple
beds
of
violets
a
great
lilac
tree
with
patches
of
blossom
here
and
there
forcing
their
way
into
a
sunlit
world
the
sea
was
blue
the
sheltered
air
where
they
sat
was
warm
and
perfumed
dunster
who
was
occupying
the
position
of
a
favoured
guest
was
feeling
very
much
at
home
there
is
one
thing
he
remarked
meditatively
which
i
can
t
help
thinking
about
you
britishers
you
may
deserve
it
or
you
may
not
but
you
do
have
the
most
almighty
sheer
envy
hamel
murmured
we
escape
from
our
tight
corners
by
not
on
your
life
sir
dunster
declared
vigorously
a
year
or
less
ago
you
got
a
north
sea
scare
and
on
the
strength
of
a
merely
honourable
understanding
with
your
neighbour
you
risk
your
country
s
very
existence
for
the
sake
of
adding
half
a
dozen
battleships
to
your
north
sea
squadron
the
day
the
last
of
those
battleships
passed
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
this
little
conference
was
plotted
i
tell
you
they
meant
to
make
history
there
there
was
enough
for
everybody
india
for
russia
a
dream
but
why
not
and
perhaps
egypt
for
france
australia
for
japan
china
and
south
africa
for
germany
why
not
you
may
laugh
at
it
on
paper
but
i
say
again
why
not
it
didn
t
quite
come
off
sir
gerald
observed
it
didn
t
dunster
admitted
partly
owing
to
you
there
were
only
two
things
needed
france
to
consider
her
own
big
interests
and
to
ignore
an
entente
from
which
she
gains
nothing
that
was
not
assured
to
her
under
the
new
agreement
and
the
money
strange
dunster
continued
how
people
forget
that
factor
and
yet
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
the
hague
conference
knew
it
we
in
the
states
are
right
outside
all
these
little
jealousies
and
wrangles
that
bring
europe
every
now
and
then
right
up
to
the
gates
of
war
but
i
m
hanged
if
there
is
one
of
you
dare
pass
through
those
gates
without
a
hand
on
our
money
markets
it
s
a
new
word
in
history
that
little
document
news
of
which
gerald
here
took
to
the
hague
the
word
of
the
money
kings
of
the
world
there
is
something
that
almost
nips
your
breath
in
the
idea
that
a
dozen
men
descended
from
the
lord
knows
whom
stopped
a
war
which
would
have
altered
the
whole
face
of
there
was
never
any
proof
hamel
remarked
that
france
would
not
have
remained
staunch
to
very
likely
not
dunster
agreed
but
on
the
other
hand
your
country
had
never
the
right
to
put
such
a
burden
upon
her
honour
remember
that
side
by
side
with
those
other
considerations
a
great
statesman
s
first
duty
is
to
the
people
over
whom
he
watches
not
to
study
the
interests
of
other
lands
however
it
s
finished
the
hague
conference
is
broken
up
the
official
organs
of
the
world
allude
to
it
if
at
all
as
an
unimportant
gathering
called
together
to
discuss
certain
frontier
questions
with
which
england
had
nothing
to
do
but
the
memory
of
it
will
live
a
good
cold
douche
for
you
people
i
should
say
and
i
hope
you
ll
take
warning
by
it
whatever
the
attitude
of
america
as
a
nation
may
be
to
these
matters
the
american
people
don
t
want
to
see
the
old
country
in
trouble
gee
whiz
what
s
that
there
was
a
little
cry
from
all
of
them
only
hamel
stood
without
sign
of
surprise
gazing
downward
with
grim
set
face
a
dull
roar
like
the
booming
of
a
gun
flashes
of
fire
and
a
column
of
smoke
and
all
that
was
left
of
david
s
tower
was
one
tottering
wall
and
a
scattered
mass
of
masonry
i
had
an
idea
hamel
said
quietly
that
david
s
tower
was
going
to
spoil
the
landscape
for
a
good
many
years
my
property
you
know
and
there
s
the
end
of
it
i
am
sick
of
seeing
people
for
the
last
few
days
come
down
and
take
photographs
of
it
for
every
little
rag
that
goes
to
dunster
pointed
out
to
the
line
of
surf
beyond
if
only
some
hand
he
remarked
could
plant
dynamite
below
that
streak
of
white
so
that
the
sea
could
disgorge
its
dead
they
tell
me
there
s
a
spanish
galleon
there
and
a
dutch
warship
besides
a
score
or
more
of
fentolin
shivered
a
little
she
drew
her
cloak
around
her
gerald
who
had
been
watching
her
sprang
to
his
feet
come
he
exclaimed
we
chose
the
gardens
for
our
last
afternoon
here
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
these
places
we
ll
go
round
the
fentolin
shook
her
head
once
more
her
face
had
recovered
its
serenity
she
looked
downward
gravely
but
with
no
sign
of
fear
there
is
nothing
to
terrify
us
there
gerald
she
declared
the
sea
has
gathered
and
the
sea
will
hold
its
hamel
held
out
his
hand
to
esther
i
have
destroyed
the
only
house
in
the
world
which
i
possess
he
said
come
and
look
for
violets
with
me
in
the
spinney
and
let
us
talk
of
the
houses
we
are
going
to
build
and
the
dreams
we
shall
dream
in
them
