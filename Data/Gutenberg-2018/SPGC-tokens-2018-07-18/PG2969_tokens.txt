chapter
xiii
my
stay
at
paris
and
my
departure
for
strasburg
where
i
find
the
renaud
my
misfortunes
at
munich
and
my
sad
visit
to
augsburg
at
ten
in
the
morning
cheered
by
the
pleasant
feeling
of
being
once
more
in
that
paris
which
is
so
imperfect
but
which
is
the
only
true
town
in
the
world
i
called
on
my
dear
madame
who
received
me
with
open
arms
she
told
me
that
the
young
count
was
quite
well
and
if
i
liked
she
would
ask
him
to
dinner
the
next
day
i
told
her
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
him
and
then
i
informed
her
that
the
operation
by
which
she
was
to
become
a
man
could
not
be
performed
till
querilinto
one
of
the
three
chiefs
of
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
was
liberated
from
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
at
lisbon
this
is
the
reason
i
added
that
i
am
going
to
augsburg
in
the
course
of
next
month
where
i
shall
confer
with
the
earl
of
stormont
as
to
the
liberation
of
the
adept
under
the
pretext
of
a
mission
from
the
portuguese
government
for
these
purposes
i
shall
require
a
good
letter
of
credit
and
some
watches
and
to
make
presents
with
as
we
shall
have
to
win
over
certain
of
the
profane
i
will
gladly
see
to
all
that
but
you
need
not
hurry
yourself
as
the
congress
will
not
meet
till
september
believe
me
it
will
never
meet
at
all
but
the
ambassadors
of
the
belligerent
powers
will
be
there
all
the
same
if
contrary
to
my
expectation
the
congress
is
held
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
to
lisbon
in
any
case
i
promise
to
see
you
again
in
the
ensuing
winter
the
fortnight
that
i
have
to
spend
here
will
enable
me
to
defeat
a
plot
of
st
germain
germain
he
would
never
dare
to
return
to
paris
i
am
certain
that
he
is
here
in
disguise
the
state
messenger
who
ordered
him
to
leave
london
has
convinced
him
the
english
minister
was
not
duped
by
the
demand
for
his
person
to
be
given
up
made
by
the
comte
in
the
name
of
the
king
to
the
all
this
was
mere
and
it
will
be
seen
that
i
guessed
rightly
madame
then
congratulated
me
on
the
charming
girl
whom
i
had
sent
from
grenoble
to
paris
valenglard
had
told
her
the
whole
story
the
king
adores
her
said
she
and
before
long
she
will
make
him
a
father
i
have
been
to
see
her
at
passi
with
the
duchesse
de
she
will
give
birth
to
a
son
who
will
make
france
happy
and
in
thirty
years
time
you
will
see
wondrous
things
of
which
unfortunately
i
can
tell
you
nothing
until
your
transformation
did
you
mention
my
name
to
her
no
i
did
not
but
i
am
sure
you
will
be
able
to
see
her
if
only
at
madame
varnier
she
was
not
mistaken
but
shortly
afterwards
an
event
happened
which
made
the
madness
of
this
excellent
woman
much
worse
towards
four
as
we
were
talking
over
my
travels
and
our
designs
she
took
a
fancy
to
walk
in
the
bois
du
boulogne
she
begged
me
to
accompany
her
and
i
acceded
to
her
request
we
walked
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
wood
and
sat
down
under
a
tree
it
is
eighteen
years
ago
said
she
since
i
fell
asleep
on
the
same
spot
that
we
now
occupy
during
my
sleep
the
divine
horosmadis
came
down
from
the
sun
and
stayed
with
me
till
i
awoke
as
i
opened
my
eyes
i
saw
him
leave
me
and
ascend
to
heaven
he
left
me
with
child
and
i
bore
a
girl
which
he
took
away
from
me
years
ago
no
doubt
to
punish
me
for
having
so
far
forgotten
myself
as
to
love
a
mortal
after
him
my
lovely
iriasis
was
like
him
you
are
quite
sure
that
was
not
the
child
father
did
not
know
me
after
he
saw
me
lying
beside
the
divine
anael
that
the
genius
of
venus
did
he
squint
to
excess
you
are
aware
then
that
he
squints
yes
and
i
know
that
at
the
amorous
crisis
he
ceases
to
squint
i
did
not
notice
that
he
too
left
me
on
account
of
my
sinning
with
an
arab
the
arab
was
sent
to
you
by
an
enemy
of
anael
the
genius
of
mercury
it
must
have
been
so
it
was
a
great
misfortune
on
the
contrary
it
rendered
you
more
fit
for
transformation
we
were
walking
towards
the
carriage
when
all
at
once
we
saw
germain
but
as
soon
as
he
noticed
us
he
turned
back
and
we
lost
sight
of
him
did
you
see
him
said
i
he
is
working
against
us
but
our
genie
makes
him
tremble
i
am
quite
thunderstruck
i
will
go
and
impart
this
piece
of
news
to
the
duc
de
choiseul
morning
i
am
curious
to
hear
what
he
will
say
when
i
tell
him
as
we
were
going
back
to
paris
i
left
madame
and
walked
to
the
porte
denis
to
see
my
brother
he
and
his
wife
received
me
with
cries
of
joy
i
thought
the
wife
very
pretty
but
very
wretched
for
providence
had
not
allowed
my
brother
to
prove
his
manhood
and
she
was
unhappily
in
love
with
him
i
say
unhappily
because
her
love
kept
her
faithful
to
him
and
if
she
had
not
been
in
love
she
might
easily
have
found
a
cure
for
her
misfortune
as
her
husband
allowed
her
perfect
liberty
she
grieved
bitterly
for
she
did
not
know
that
my
brother
was
impotent
and
fancied
that
the
reason
of
his
abstention
was
that
he
did
not
return
her
love
and
the
mistake
was
an
excusable
one
for
he
was
like
a
hercules
and
indeed
he
was
one
except
where
it
was
most
to
be
desired
her
grief
threw
her
into
a
consumption
of
which
she
died
five
or
six
years
later
she
did
not
mean
her
death
to
be
a
punishment
to
her
husband
but
we
shall
see
that
it
was
so
the
next
day
i
called
on
madame
varnier
to
give
her
madame
letter
i
was
cordially
welcomed
and
madame
varnier
was
kind
enough
to
say
that
she
had
rather
see
me
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
her
niece
had
told
her
such
strange
things
about
me
that
she
had
got
quite
curious
this
as
is
well
known
is
a
prevailing
complaint
with
women
you
shall
see
my
niece
she
said
and
she
will
tell
you
all
about
herself
she
wrote
her
a
note
and
put
madame
morin
letter
under
the
same
envelope
if
you
want
to
know
what
my
niece
answer
is
said
madame
varnier
you
must
dine
with
me
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
she
immediately
told
her
servant
that
she
was
not
at
home
to
anyone
the
small
messenger
who
had
taken
the
note
to
passi
returned
at
four
with
the
following
epistle
the
moment
in
which
i
see
the
chevalier
de
seingalt
once
more
will
be
one
of
the
happiest
of
my
life
ask
him
to
be
at
your
house
at
ten
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
if
he
ca
come
then
please
let
me
know
after
reading
the
note
and
promising
to
keep
the
appointment
i
left
madame
varnier
and
called
on
madame
de
rumain
who
told
me
i
must
spend
a
whole
day
with
her
as
she
had
several
questions
to
put
to
my
oracle
next
day
madame
told
me
the
reply
she
had
from
the
duc
de
choiseul
when
she
told
him
that
she
had
seen
the
comte
de
germain
in
the
bois
du
boulogne
i
should
not
be
surprised
said
the
minister
considering
that
he
spent
the
night
in
my
closet
the
duke
was
a
man
of
wit
and
a
man
of
the
world
he
only
kept
secrets
when
they
were
really
important
ones
very
different
from
those
diplomatists
who
think
they
give
themselves
importance
by
making
a
mystery
of
trifles
of
no
consequence
it
is
true
that
the
duc
de
choiseul
very
seldom
thought
anything
of
great
importance
and
in
point
of
fact
if
there
were
less
intrigue
and
more
truth
about
diplomacy
as
there
ought
to
be
concealment
would
be
rather
ridiculous
than
necessary
the
duke
had
pretended
to
disgrace
germain
in
france
that
he
might
use
him
as
a
spy
in
london
but
lord
halifax
was
by
no
means
taken
in
by
this
stratagem
however
all
governments
have
the
politeness
to
afford
one
another
these
services
so
that
none
of
them
can
reproach
the
others
the
small
conte
after
caressing
me
affectionately
begged
me
to
come
and
breakfast
with
him
at
his
telling
me
that
mdlle
viar
would
be
glad
to
see
me
the
next
day
i
took
care
not
to
fail
in
my
appointment
with
the
fair
lady
i
was
at
madame
varnier
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
arrival
of
the
dazzling
brunette
and
i
waited
for
her
with
a
beating
at
the
heart
which
shewed
me
that
the
small
favours
she
had
given
me
had
not
quenched
the
flame
of
love
when
she
made
her
appearance
the
stoutness
of
her
figure
carried
respect
with
it
so
that
i
did
not
feel
as
if
i
could
come
forward
and
greet
her
tenderly
but
she
was
far
from
thinking
that
more
respect
was
due
to
her
than
when
she
was
at
grenoble
poor
but
also
pure
she
kissed
me
affectionately
and
told
me
as
much
they
think
i
am
happy
said
she
and
envy
my
lot
but
can
one
be
happy
after
the
loss
of
one
for
the
last
six
months
i
have
only
smiled
not
laughed
while
at
grenoble
i
laughed
heartily
from
true
gladness
i
have
diamonds
lace
a
beautiful
house
a
superb
carriage
a
lovely
garden
and
a
maid
of
honour
who
perhaps
despises
me
and
although
the
highest
court
ladies
treat
me
like
a
princess
i
do
not
pass
a
single
day
without
experiencing
some
mortification
mortification
yes
people
come
and
bring
pleas
before
me
and
i
am
obliged
to
send
them
away
as
i
dare
not
ask
the
king
anything
why
not
because
i
can
not
look
on
him
as
my
lover
only
he
is
always
my
sovereign
too
ah
happiness
is
to
be
sought
for
in
simple
homes
not
in
pompous
palaces
happiness
is
gained
by
complying
with
the
duties
of
whatever
condition
of
life
one
is
in
and
you
must
constrain
yourself
to
rise
to
that
exalted
station
in
which
destiny
has
placed
you
i
can
not
do
it
i
love
the
king
and
i
am
always
afraid
of
vexing
him
i
am
always
thinking
that
he
does
too
much
for
me
and
thus
i
dare
not
ask
for
anything
for
others
but
i
am
sure
the
king
would
be
only
too
glad
to
shew
his
love
for
you
by
benefiting
the
persons
in
whom
you
take
an
interest
i
know
he
would
and
that
thought
makes
me
happy
but
i
can
not
overcome
my
feeling
of
repugnance
to
asking
favours
i
have
a
hundred
louis
a
month
for
and
i
distribute
it
in
alms
and
presents
but
with
due
economy
so
that
i
am
not
penniless
at
the
end
of
the
month
i
have
a
foolish
notion
that
the
chief
reason
the
king
loves
me
is
that
i
do
not
importune
him
and
do
you
love
him
how
can
i
help
it
he
is
kindly
handsome
and
polite
to
excess
in
short
he
possesses
all
the
qualities
to
captivate
a
heart
he
is
always
asking
me
if
i
am
pleased
with
my
furniture
my
clothes
my
servants
and
my
garden
and
if
i
desire
anything
altered
i
thank
him
with
a
kiss
and
tell
him
that
i
am
pleased
with
everything
does
he
ever
speak
of
the
scion
you
are
going
to
present
to
him
he
often
says
that
i
ought
to
be
careful
of
myself
in
my
situation
i
am
hoping
that
he
will
recognize
my
son
as
a
prince
of
the
blood
he
ought
in
justice
to
do
so
as
the
queen
is
dead
to
be
sure
he
will
i
should
be
very
happy
if
i
had
a
son
i
wish
i
felt
sure
that
i
would
have
one
but
i
say
nothing
about
this
to
anyone
if
i
dared
speak
to
the
king
about
the
horoscope
i
am
certain
he
would
want
to
know
you
but
i
am
afraid
of
evil
tongues
so
am
i
continue
in
your
discreet
course
and
nothing
will
come
to
disturb
your
happiness
which
may
become
greater
and
which
i
am
pleased
to
have
procured
for
you
we
did
not
part
without
tears
she
was
the
first
to
go
after
kissing
me
and
calling
me
her
best
friend
i
stayed
a
short
time
with
madame
varnier
to
compose
my
feelings
and
i
told
her
that
i
should
have
married
her
instead
of
drawing
her
horoscope
she
would
no
doubt
have
been
happier
you
did
not
foresee
perhaps
her
timidity
and
her
lack
of
ambition
i
can
assure
you
that
i
did
not
reckon
upon
her
courage
or
ambition
i
laid
aside
my
own
happiness
to
think
only
of
hers
but
what
is
done
can
not
be
recalled
and
i
shall
be
consoled
if
i
see
her
perfectly
happy
at
last
i
hope
indeed
she
will
be
so
above
all
if
she
is
delivered
of
a
son
i
dined
with
madame
and
we
decided
to
send
back
aranda
to
his
that
we
might
be
more
free
to
pursue
our
cabalistic
operations
and
afterwards
i
went
to
the
opera
where
my
brother
had
made
an
appointment
with
me
he
took
me
to
sup
at
madame
vanloo
and
she
received
me
in
the
friendliest
manner
possible
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
madame
blondel
and
her
husband
said
she
the
reader
will
recollect
that
madame
blondel
was
manon
baletti
whom
i
was
to
have
married
does
she
know
i
am
coming
i
enquired
no
i
promise
myself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
surprise
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
not
wishing
to
enjoy
my
surprise
as
well
we
shall
see
each
other
again
but
not
so
i
must
bid
you
farewell
for
as
i
am
a
man
of
honour
i
hope
never
to
be
under
the
same
roof
as
madame
blondel
again
with
this
i
left
the
room
leaving
everybody
in
astonishment
and
not
knowing
where
to
go
i
took
a
coach
and
went
to
sup
with
my
who
was
extremely
glad
to
see
me
but
all
through
this
charming
woman
did
nothing
but
complain
of
her
husband
saying
that
he
had
no
business
to
marry
her
knowing
that
he
could
not
shew
himself
a
man
why
did
you
not
make
the
trial
before
you
married
was
it
for
me
to
propose
such
a
thing
how
should
i
suppose
that
such
a
fine
man
was
impotent
but
i
will
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
as
you
know
i
was
a
dancer
at
the
comedie
italienne
and
i
was
the
mistress
of
de
sauci
the
ecclesiastical
commissioner
he
brought
your
brother
to
my
house
i
liked
him
and
before
long
i
saw
that
he
loved
me
my
lover
advised
me
that
it
was
an
opportunity
for
getting
married
and
making
my
fortune
with
this
idea
i
conceived
the
plan
of
not
granting
him
any
favours
he
used
to
come
and
see
me
in
the
morning
and
often
found
me
in
bed
we
talked
together
and
his
passions
seemed
to
be
aroused
but
it
all
ended
in
kissing
on
my
part
i
was
waiting
for
a
formal
declaration
and
a
proposal
of
marriage
at
that
period
de
sauci
settled
an
annuity
of
a
thousand
crowns
on
me
on
the
condition
that
i
left
the
stage
in
the
spring
de
sauci
invited
your
brother
to
spend
a
month
in
his
country
house
i
was
of
the
party
but
for
propriety
sake
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
pass
as
your
brother
wife
casanova
enjoyed
the
idea
looking
upon
it
as
a
jest
and
not
thinking
of
the
consequences
i
was
therefore
introduced
as
his
wife
to
my
lover
family
as
also
to
his
relations
who
were
judges
officers
and
men
about
town
and
to
their
wives
who
were
all
women
of
fashion
your
brother
was
in
high
glee
that
to
play
our
parts
properly
we
were
obliged
to
sleep
together
for
my
part
i
was
far
from
disliking
the
idea
or
at
all
events
i
looked
upon
it
as
a
short
cut
to
the
marriage
i
desired
but
how
can
i
tell
you
though
tender
and
affectionate
in
everything
your
brother
slept
with
me
for
a
month
without
our
attaining
what
seemed
the
natural
result
under
the
circumstances
you
might
have
concluded
then
that
he
was
impotent
for
unless
he
were
made
of
stone
or
had
taken
a
vow
of
chastity
his
conduct
was
inexplicable
the
fact
is
that
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
he
was
capable
or
incapable
of
giving
me
substantial
proof
of
his
love
why
did
you
not
ascertain
his
condition
for
yourself
a
feeling
of
foolish
pride
prevented
me
from
putting
him
to
the
test
i
did
not
suspect
the
truth
but
imagined
reasons
flattering
to
myself
i
thought
that
he
loved
me
so
truly
that
he
would
not
do
anything
before
i
was
his
wife
that
idea
prevented
me
humiliating
myself
by
making
him
give
me
some
positive
proof
of
his
powers
that
supposition
would
have
been
tenable
though
highly
improbable
if
you
had
been
an
innocent
young
maid
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
your
novitiate
was
long
over
very
true
but
what
can
you
expect
of
a
woman
impelled
by
love
and
vanity
your
reasoning
is
excellent
but
it
comes
rather
late
well
at
last
we
went
back
to
paris
your
brother
to
his
house
and
i
to
mine
while
he
continued
his
courtship
and
i
could
not
understand
what
he
meant
by
such
strange
behaviour
de
sauci
who
knew
that
nothing
serious
had
taken
place
between
us
tried
in
vain
to
solve
the
enigma
doubt
he
is
afraid
of
getting
you
with
child
he
said
of
thus
being
obliged
to
marry
you
i
began
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
but
i
thought
it
a
strange
line
for
a
man
in
love
to
take
de
nesle
an
officer
in
the
french
guards
who
had
a
pretty
wife
i
had
met
in
the
country
went
to
your
brother
to
call
on
me
not
finding
me
there
he
asked
why
we
did
not
live
together
your
brother
replied
openly
that
our
marriage
had
been
a
mere
jest
de
nesle
then
came
to
me
to
enquire
if
this
were
the
truth
and
when
he
heard
that
it
was
he
asked
me
how
i
would
like
him
to
make
casanova
marry
me
i
answered
that
i
should
be
delighted
and
that
was
enough
for
him
he
went
again
to
your
brother
and
told
him
that
his
wife
would
never
have
associated
with
me
on
equal
terms
if
i
had
not
been
introduced
to
her
as
a
married
woman
that
the
deceit
was
an
insult
to
all
the
company
at
the
which
must
be
wiped
out
by
his
marrying
me
within
the
week
or
by
fighting
a
duel
de
nesle
added
that
if
he
fell
he
would
be
avenged
by
all
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
offended
in
the
same
way
casanova
replied
laughing
that
so
far
from
fighting
to
escape
marrying
me
he
was
ready
to
break
a
lance
to
get
me
love
her
he
said
if
she
loves
me
i
am
quite
ready
to
give
her
my
hand
be
kind
enough
he
added
prepare
the
way
for
me
and
i
will
marry
her
whenever
you
like
de
nesle
embraced
him
and
promised
to
see
to
everything
he
brought
me
the
joyful
news
and
in
a
week
all
was
over
de
nesle
gave
us
a
splendid
supper
on
our
and
since
then
i
have
had
the
title
of
his
wife
it
is
an
empty
title
however
for
despite
the
ceremony
and
the
fatal
yes
i
am
no
wife
for
your
brother
is
completely
impotent
i
am
an
unhappy
wretch
and
it
is
all
his
fault
for
he
ought
to
have
known
his
own
condition
he
has
deceived
me
horribly
but
he
was
obliged
to
act
as
he
did
he
is
more
to
be
pitied
than
to
be
blamed
i
also
pity
you
but
i
think
you
are
in
the
wrong
for
after
his
sleeping
with
you
for
a
month
without
giving
any
proof
of
his
manhood
you
might
have
guessed
the
truth
even
if
you
had
been
a
perfect
novice
de
sauci
ought
to
have
known
what
was
the
matter
he
must
be
aware
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
sleep
beside
a
pretty
woman
and
to
press
her
naked
body
to
his
breast
without
becoming
in
spite
of
himself
in
a
state
which
would
admit
of
no
concealment
that
is
in
case
he
were
not
impotent
all
that
seems
very
reasonable
but
nevertheless
neither
of
us
thought
of
it
your
brother
looks
such
a
hercules
there
are
two
remedies
open
to
you
you
can
either
have
your
marriage
annulled
or
you
can
take
a
lover
and
i
am
sure
that
my
brother
is
too
reasonable
a
man
to
offer
any
opposition
to
the
latter
course
i
am
perfectly
free
but
i
can
neither
avail
myself
of
a
divorce
nor
of
a
lover
for
the
wretch
treats
me
so
kindly
that
i
love
him
more
and
more
which
doubtless
makes
my
misfortune
harder
to
bear
the
poor
woman
was
so
unhappy
that
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
console
her
but
it
was
out
of
the
question
however
the
mere
telling
of
her
story
had
afforded
her
some
solace
and
after
kissing
her
in
such
a
way
as
to
convince
her
that
i
was
not
like
my
brother
i
wished
her
good
night
the
next
day
i
called
on
madame
vanloo
who
informed
me
that
madame
blondel
had
charged
her
to
thank
me
for
having
gone
away
while
her
husband
wished
me
to
know
that
he
was
sorry
not
to
have
seen
me
to
express
his
gratitude
he
seems
to
have
found
his
wife
a
maid
but
that
no
fault
of
mine
and
manon
baletti
is
the
only
person
he
ought
to
be
grateful
to
they
tell
me
that
he
has
a
pretty
baby
and
that
he
lives
at
the
louvre
while
she
has
another
house
in
the
rue
yes
but
he
has
supper
with
her
every
evening
it
an
odd
way
of
living
i
assure
you
it
answers
capitally
blondel
regards
his
wife
as
his
mistress
he
says
that
that
keeps
the
flame
of
love
alight
and
that
as
he
never
had
a
mistress
worthy
of
being
a
wife
he
is
delighted
to
have
a
wife
worthy
of
being
a
mistress
the
next
day
i
devoted
entirely
to
madame
de
rumain
and
we
were
occupied
with
knotty
questions
till
the
evening
i
left
her
well
pleased
the
marriage
of
her
daughter
mdlle
cotenfau
with
de
polignac
which
took
place
five
or
six
years
later
was
the
result
of
our
cabalistic
calculations
the
fair
of
the
rue
des
prouveres
whom
i
had
loved
so
well
was
no
longer
in
paris
she
had
gone
off
with
a
de
langlade
and
her
husband
was
inconsolable
camille
was
coralline
had
become
the
titulary
mistress
of
the
comte
de
la
marche
son
of
the
prince
of
conti
and
the
issue
of
this
union
was
a
son
whom
i
knew
twenty
years
later
he
called
himself
the
chevalier
de
montreal
and
wore
the
cross
of
the
knights
of
malta
several
other
girls
i
had
known
were
widowed
and
in
the
country
or
had
become
inaccessible
in
other
ways
such
was
the
paris
of
my
day
the
actors
on
its
stage
changed
as
rapidly
as
the
fashions
i
devoted
a
whole
day
to
my
old
friend
baletti
who
had
left
the
theatre
and
married
a
pretty
on
the
death
of
his
father
he
was
making
experiments
with
a
view
to
finding
the
philosopher
stone
i
was
agreeably
surprised
at
meeting
the
poet
poinsinet
at
the
comedic
francaise
he
embraced
me
again
and
again
and
told
me
that
du
tillot
had
overwhelmed
him
with
kindness
at
parma
he
would
not
get
me
anything
to
do
said
poinsinet
because
a
french
poet
is
rather
at
a
discount
in
italy
have
you
heard
anything
of
lord
lismore
yes
he
wrote
to
his
mother
from
leghorn
telling
her
that
he
was
going
to
the
indies
and
that
if
you
had
not
been
good
enough
to
give
him
a
thousand
louis
he
would
have
been
a
prisoner
at
rome
his
fate
interests
me
extremely
and
i
should
be
glad
to
call
on
his
with
you
i
will
tell
her
that
you
are
in
paris
and
i
am
sure
that
she
will
invite
you
to
supper
for
she
has
the
greatest
desire
to
talk
to
you
how
are
you
getting
on
here
are
you
still
content
to
serve
apollo
he
is
not
the
god
of
wealth
by
any
means
i
have
no
money
and
no
room
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
a
supper
if
you
will
ask
me
i
will
read
you
my
play
the
which
has
been
accepted
i
am
sure
it
will
be
successful
the
was
a
short
prose
play
in
which
the
poet
satirised
the
jargon
of
herrenschwand
brother
of
the
doctor
i
had
consulted
at
soleure
the
play
proved
to
be
a
great
success
i
took
poinsinet
home
to
supper
and
the
poor
nursling
of
the
muses
ate
for
four
in
the
morning
he
came
to
tell
me
that
the
countess
of
lismore
expected
me
to
supper
i
found
the
lady
still
pretty
in
company
with
her
aged
lover
de
albin
archbishop
of
cambrai
who
spent
all
the
revenues
of
his
see
on
her
this
worthy
prelate
was
one
of
the
illegitimate
children
of
the
duc
the
famous
regent
by
an
actress
he
supped
with
us
but
he
only
opened
his
mouth
to
eat
and
his
mistress
only
spoke
of
her
son
whose
talents
she
lauded
to
the
skies
though
he
was
in
reality
a
mere
scamp
but
i
felt
in
duty
bound
to
echo
what
she
said
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
contradict
her
i
promised
to
let
her
know
if
i
saw
anything
more
of
him
poinsinet
who
was
hearthless
and
homeless
as
they
say
spent
the
night
in
my
room
and
in
the
morning
i
gave
him
two
cups
of
chocolate
and
some
money
wherewith
to
get
a
lodging
i
never
saw
him
again
and
a
few
years
after
he
was
drowned
not
in
the
fountain
of
hippocrene
but
in
the
guadalquivir
he
told
me
that
he
had
spent
a
week
with
de
voltaire
and
that
he
had
hastened
his
return
to
paris
to
obtain
the
release
of
the
abbe
morellet
from
the
bastile
i
had
nothing
more
to
do
at
paris
and
i
was
only
waiting
for
some
clothes
to
be
made
and
for
a
cross
of
the
order
with
which
the
holy
father
had
decorated
me
to
be
set
with
diamonds
and
rubies
i
had
waited
for
five
or
six
days
when
an
unfortunate
incident
obliged
me
to
take
a
hasty
departure
i
am
loth
to
write
what
follows
for
it
was
all
my
own
fault
that
i
was
nearly
losing
my
life
and
my
honour
i
pity
those
simpletons
who
blame
fortune
and
not
themselves
for
their
misfortunes
i
was
walking
in
the
tuileries
at
ten
in
the
morning
when
i
was
unlucky
enough
to
meet
the
dangenancour
and
another
girl
this
dangenancour
was
a
dancer
at
the
whom
i
had
desired
to
meet
previously
to
my
last
departure
from
paris
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
lucky
chance
which
threw
her
in
my
way
and
accosted
her
and
had
not
much
trouble
in
inducing
her
to
dine
with
me
at
choisi
we
walked
towards
the
where
we
took
a
coach
after
dinner
had
been
ordered
we
were
taking
a
turn
in
the
garden
when
i
saw
a
carriage
stop
and
two
adventurers
whom
i
knew
getting
out
of
it
with
two
girls
friends
of
the
ones
i
had
with
me
the
wretched
landlady
who
was
standing
at
the
door
said
that
if
we
liked
to
sit
down
together
she
could
give
us
an
excellent
dinner
and
i
said
nothing
or
rather
i
assented
to
the
yes
of
my
two
nymphs
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
after
the
bill
was
paid
and
we
were
on
the
point
of
returning
to
paris
i
noticed
that
a
ring
which
i
had
taken
off
to
shew
to
one
of
the
adventurers
named
santis
was
still
missing
it
was
an
exceedingly
pretty
miniature
and
the
diamond
setting
had
cost
me
louis
i
politely
begged
santis
to
return
me
the
ring
and
he
replied
with
the
utmost
coolness
that
he
had
done
so
already
if
you
had
returned
it
said
i
it
would
be
on
my
finger
and
you
see
that
it
is
not
he
persisted
in
his
assertion
the
girls
said
nothing
but
friend
a
portuguese
named
xavier
dared
to
tell
me
that
he
had
seen
the
ring
returned
you
a
liar
i
exclaimed
and
without
more
ado
i
took
hold
of
santis
by
the
collar
and
swore
i
would
rot
let
him
go
till
he
returned
me
my
ring
the
portuguese
rose
to
come
to
his
friend
rescue
while
i
stepped
back
and
drew
my
sword
repeating
my
determination
not
to
let
them
go
the
landlady
came
on
the
scene
and
began
to
shriek
and
santis
asked
me
to
give
him
a
few
words
apart
i
thought
in
all
good
faith
that
he
was
ashamed
to
restore
the
ring
before
company
but
that
he
would
give
it
me
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
i
sheathed
my
sword
and
told
him
to
come
with
me
xavier
got
into
the
carriage
with
the
four
girls
and
they
all
went
back
to
paris
santis
followed
me
to
the
back
of
the
inn
and
then
assuming
a
pleasant
smile
he
told
me
that
he
had
put
the
ring
into
his
friend
pocket
for
a
joke
but
that
i
should
have
it
back
at
paris
that
an
idle
tale
i
exclaimed
your
friend
said
that
he
saw
you
return
it
and
now
he
has
escaped
me
do
you
think
that
i
am
green
enough
to
be
taken
in
by
this
sort
of
thing
you
a
couple
of
robbers
so
saying
i
stretched
out
my
hand
for
his
but
he
stepped
back
and
drew
his
sword
i
drew
mine
and
we
had
scarcely
crossed
swords
when
he
thrust
and
i
parrying
rushed
in
and
ran
him
through
and
through
he
fell
to
the
ground
calling
help
i
sheathed
my
sword
and
without
troubling
myself
about
him
got
into
my
coach
and
drove
back
to
paris
i
got
down
in
the
place
maubert
and
walked
by
a
circuitous
way
to
my
hotel
i
was
sure
that
no
one
could
have
come
after
me
there
as
my
landlord
did
not
even
know
my
name
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
packing
up
my
trunks
and
after
telling
costa
to
place
them
on
my
carriage
i
went
to
madame
after
i
had
told
her
of
what
had
happened
i
begged
her
as
soon
as
that
which
she
had
for
me
was
ready
to
send
it
to
me
at
augsburg
by
costa
i
should
have
told
her
to
entrust
it
to
one
of
her
own
servants
but
my
good
genius
had
left
me
that
day
besides
i
did
not
look
upon
costa
as
a
thief
when
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
i
gave
the
rascal
his
instructions
telling
him
to
be
quick
and
to
keep
his
own
counsel
and
then
i
gave
him
money
for
the
journey
i
left
paris
in
my
carriage
drawn
by
four
hired
horses
which
took
me
as
far
as
the
second
post
and
i
did
not
stop
till
i
got
to
strasburg
where
i
found
desarmoises
and
my
spaniard
there
was
nothing
to
keep
me
in
strasburg
so
i
wanted
to
cross
the
rhine
immediately
but
desarmoises
persuaded
me
to
come
with
him
to
see
an
extremely
pretty
woman
who
had
only
delayed
her
departure
for
augsburg
in
the
hope
that
we
might
journey
there
together
you
know
the
lady
said
the
false
marquis
but
she
made
me
give
my
word
of
honour
that
i
would
not
tell
you
she
has
only
her
maid
with
her
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
pleased
to
see
her
my
curiosity
made
me
give
in
i
followed
desarmoises
and
came
into
a
room
where
i
saw
a
woman
whom
i
did
not
recognize
at
first
i
collected
my
thoughts
and
the
lady
turned
out
to
be
a
dancer
whom
i
had
admired
on
the
dresden
boards
eight
years
before
she
was
then
mistress
to
count
bruhl
but
i
had
not
even
attempted
to
win
her
favour
she
had
an
excellent
carriage
and
as
she
was
ready
to
go
to
augsburg
i
immediately
concluded
that
we
could
make
the
journey
together
very
pleasantly
after
the
usual
compliments
had
passed
we
decided
on
leaving
for
augsburg
the
following
morning
the
lady
was
going
to
munich
but
as
i
had
no
business
there
we
agreed
that
she
should
go
by
herself
i
am
quite
sure
she
said
afterwards
that
you
will
come
too
for
the
ambassadors
do
not
assemble
at
augsburg
till
next
september
we
supped
together
and
next
morning
we
started
on
our
way
she
in
her
carriage
with
her
maid
and
i
in
mine
with
desarmoises
preceded
by
le
duc
on
horseback
at
rastadt
however
we
made
a
change
the
renaud
as
she
was
called
thinking
that
she
would
give
less
opportunity
for
curious
surmises
by
riding
with
me
while
desarmoises
went
with
the
servant
we
soon
became
intimate
she
told
me
about
herself
or
pretended
to
and
i
told
her
all
that
i
did
not
want
to
conceal
i
informed
her
that
i
was
an
agent
of
the
court
of
lisbon
and
she
believed
me
while
for
my
part
i
believed
that
she
was
only
going
to
munich
and
augsburg
to
sell
her
diamonds
we
began
to
talk
about
desarmoises
and
she
said
that
it
was
well
enough
for
me
to
associate
with
him
but
i
should
not
countenance
his
styling
himself
marquis
but
said
i
he
is
the
son
of
the
marquis
desarmoises
of
nancy
no
he
is
he
is
only
a
retired
messenger
with
a
small
pension
from
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
i
know
the
marquis
desarmoises
he
lives
at
nancy
and
is
not
so
old
as
our
friend
then
one
ca
see
how
he
can
be
desarmoises
father
the
landlord
of
the
inn
at
strasburg
knew
him
when
he
was
a
messenger
how
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
we
met
at
the
table
after
dinner
he
came
up
to
my
room
and
told
me
he
was
waiting
for
a
gentleman
who
was
going
to
augsburg
and
that
we
might
make
the
journey
together
he
told
me
the
name
and
after
questioning
him
i
concluded
that
the
gentleman
was
yourself
so
here
we
are
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
but
listen
to
me
i
advise
you
to
drop
all
false
styles
and
titles
why
do
you
call
yourself
seingalt
because
it
my
name
but
that
does
prevent
my
old
friends
calling
me
casanova
for
i
am
both
you
understand
oh
yes
i
understand
your
mother
is
at
prague
and
as
she
does
get
her
pension
on
account
of
the
war
i
am
afraid
she
must
be
rather
in
difficulties
i
know
it
but
i
do
not
forget
my
filial
duties
i
have
sent
her
some
money
that
right
where
are
you
going
to
stay
at
augsburg
i
shall
take
a
house
and
if
you
like
you
shall
be
the
mistress
and
do
the
honours
that
would
be
delightful
we
will
give
little
suppers
and
play
cards
all
night
your
programme
is
an
excellent
one
i
will
see
that
you
get
a
good
cook
all
the
bavarian
cooks
are
good
we
shall
cut
a
fine
figure
and
people
will
say
we
love
each
other
madly
you
must
know
dearest
that
i
do
not
understand
jokes
at
the
expense
of
fidelity
you
may
trust
me
for
that
you
know
how
i
lived
at
dresden
i
will
trust
you
but
not
blindly
i
promise
you
and
now
let
us
address
each
other
in
the
same
way
you
must
call
me
tu
you
must
remember
we
are
lovers
kiss
me
the
fair
renaud
did
not
like
traveling
by
night
she
preferred
to
eat
a
good
supper
to
drink
heavily
and
to
go
to
bed
just
as
her
head
began
to
whirl
the
heat
of
the
wine
made
her
into
a
bacchante
hard
to
appease
but
when
i
could
do
no
more
i
told
her
to
leave
me
alone
and
she
had
to
obey
when
we
reached
augsburg
we
alighted
at
the
three
moors
but
the
landlord
told
us
that
though
he
could
give
us
a
good
dinner
he
could
not
put
us
up
as
the
whole
of
the
hotel
had
been
engaged
by
the
french
ambassador
i
called
on
corti
the
banker
to
whom
i
was
accredited
and
he
soon
got
me
a
furnished
house
with
a
garden
which
i
took
for
six
months
the
renaud
liked
it
immensely
no
one
had
yet
arrived
at
augsburg
the
renaud
contrived
to
make
me
feel
that
i
should
be
lonely
at
augsburg
without
her
and
succeeded
in
persuading
me
to
come
with
her
to
munich
we
put
up
at
the
stag
and
made
ourselves
very
comfortable
while
desarmoises
went
to
stay
somewhere
else
as
my
business
and
that
of
my
new
mate
had
nothing
in
common
i
gave
her
a
servant
and
a
carriage
to
herself
and
made
myself
the
same
allowance
the
abbe
gama
had
given
me
a
letter
from
the
commendatore
almada
for
lord
stormont
the
english
ambassador
at
the
court
of
bavaria
this
nobleman
being
then
at
munich
i
hastened
to
deliver
the
letter
he
received
me
very
well
and
promised
to
do
all
he
could
as
soon
as
he
had
time
as
lord
halifax
had
told
him
all
about
it
on
leaving
his
britannic
lordship
i
called
on
de
folard
the
french
ambassador
and
gave
him
a
letter
from
de
choiseul
de
folard
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
and
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
introduced
me
to
the
elector
during
the
four
fatal
weeks
i
spent
at
munich
the
ambassador
house
was
the
only
one
i
frequented
i
call
these
weeks
fatal
and
with
reason
for
in
then
i
lost
all
my
money
i
pledged
jewels
which
i
never
recovered
to
the
amount
of
forty
thousand
francs
and
finally
i
lost
my
health
my
assassins
were
the
renaud
and
desarmoises
who
owed
me
so
much
and
paid
me
so
badly
the
third
day
after
my
arrival
i
had
to
call
on
the
dowager
electress
of
saxony
it
was
my
who
was
in
her
train
that
made
me
go
by
telling
me
that
it
must
be
done
as
she
knew
me
and
had
been
enquiring
for
me
i
had
no
reason
to
repent
of
my
politeness
in
going
as
the
electress
gave
me
a
good
reception
and
made
me
talk
to
any
extent
she
was
extremely
curious
like
most
people
who
have
no
employment
and
have
not
sufficient
intelligence
to
amuse
themselves
i
have
done
a
good
many
foolish
things
in
the
course
of
my
existence
i
confess
it
as
frankly
as
rousseau
and
my
memoirs
are
not
so
egotistic
as
those
of
that
unfortunate
genius
but
i
never
committed
such
an
act
of
folly
as
i
did
when
i
went
to
munich
where
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
it
was
a
crisis
in
my
life
my
evil
genius
had
made
me
commit
one
folly
after
another
since
i
left
turin
the
evening
at
lord
lismore
my
connection
with
desarmoises
my
party
at
choisi
my
trust
in
costa
my
union
with
the
renaud
and
worse
than
all
my
folly
in
letting
myself
play
at
faro
at
a
place
where
the
knavery
of
the
gamesters
is
renowned
all
over
europe
followed
one
another
in
fatal
succession
among
the
players
was
the
famous
or
rather
infamous
affisio
the
friend
of
the
duc
de
whom
the
duke
called
his
and
who
was
known
for
the
keenest
rogue
in
the
world
i
played
every
day
and
as
i
often
lost
money
on
my
word
of
honour
the
necessity
of
paying
the
next
day
often
caused
me
the
utmost
anxiety
when
i
had
exhausted
my
credit
with
the
bankers
i
had
recourse
to
the
jews
who
require
pledges
and
in
this
desarmoises
and
the
renaud
were
my
agents
the
latter
of
whom
ended
by
making
herself
mistress
of
all
my
property
this
was
not
the
worst
thing
she
did
to
me
for
she
gave
me
a
disease
which
devoured
her
interior
parts
and
left
no
marks
outwardly
and
was
thus
all
the
more
dangerous
as
the
freshness
of
her
complexion
seemed
to
indicate
the
most
perfect
health
in
short
this
serpent
who
must
have
come
from
hell
to
destroy
me
had
acquired
such
a
mastery
over
me
that
she
persuaded
me
that
she
would
be
dishonoured
if
i
called
in
a
doctor
during
our
stay
at
munich
as
everybody
knew
that
we
were
living
together
as
man
and
wife
i
can
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
my
wits
to
let
myself
be
so
beguiled
while
every
day
i
renewed
the
poison
that
she
had
poured
into
my
veins
my
stay
at
munich
was
a
kind
of
curse
throughout
that
dreadful
month
i
seemed
to
have
a
foretaste
of
the
pains
of
the
damned
the
renaud
loved
gaming
and
desarmoises
was
her
partner
i
took
care
not
to
play
with
them
for
the
false
marquis
was
an
unmitigated
cheat
and
often
tricked
with
less
skill
than
impudence
he
asked
disreputable
people
to
my
house
and
treated
them
at
my
expense
every
evening
scenes
of
a
disgraceful
character
took
place
the
dowager
electress
mortified
me
extremely
by
the
way
she
addressed
me
on
my
last
two
visits
to
her
everybody
knows
what
kind
of
a
life
you
lead
here
and
the
way
the
renaud
behaves
possibly
without
your
knowing
it
i
advise
you
to
have
done
with
her
as
your
character
is
suffering
she
did
not
know
what
a
thraldom
i
was
under
i
had
left
paris
for
a
month
and
i
had
neither
heard
of
madame
nor
of
costa
i
could
not
guess
the
reason
but
i
began
to
suspect
my
italian
fidelity
i
also
feared
lest
my
good
madame
might
be
dead
or
have
come
to
her
senses
which
would
have
come
to
the
same
thing
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
and
i
could
not
possibly
return
to
paris
to
obtain
the
information
which
was
so
necessary
both
for
calming
my
mind
and
refilling
my
purse
i
was
in
a
terrible
state
and
my
sharpest
pang
was
that
i
began
to
experience
a
certain
abatement
of
my
vigors
the
natural
result
of
advancing
years
i
had
no
longer
that
daring
born
of
youth
and
the
knowledge
of
one
strength
and
i
was
not
yet
old
enough
to
have
learnt
how
to
husband
my
forces
nevertheless
i
made
an
effort
and
took
a
sudden
leave
of
my
mistress
telling
her
i
would
await
her
at
augsburg
she
did
not
try
to
detain
me
but
promised
to
rejoin
me
as
soon
as
possible
she
was
engaged
in
selling
her
jewellery
i
set
out
preceded
by
le
duc
feeling
very
glad
that
desarmoises
had
chosen
to
stay
with
the
wretched
woman
to
whom
he
had
introduced
me
when
i
reached
my
pretty
house
at
augsburg
i
took
to
my
bed
determined
not
to
rise
till
i
was
cured
or
dead
carli
my
banker
recommended
to
me
a
doctor
named
cephalides
a
pupil
of
the
famous
fayet
who
had
cured
me
of
a
similar
complaint
several
years
before
this
cephalides
was
considered
the
best
doctor
in
augsburg
he
examined
me
and
declared
he
could
cure
me
by
sudorifics
without
having
recourse
to
the
knife
he
began
his
treatment
by
putting
me
on
a
severe
regimen
ordering
baths
and
applying
mercury
locally
i
endured
this
treatment
for
six
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
time
i
found
myself
worse
than
at
the
beginning
i
had
become
terribly
thin
and
i
had
two
enormous
inguinal
tumours
i
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
have
them
lanced
but
though
the
operation
nearly
killed
me
it
did
not
to
make
me
any
better
he
was
so
clumsy
as
to
cut
the
artery
causing
great
loss
of
blood
which
was
arrested
with
difficulty
and
would
have
proved
fatal
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
care
of
algardi
a
bolognese
doctor
in
the
service
of
the
of
augsburg
i
had
enough
of
cephalides
and
algardi
prepared
in
my
presence
pills
containing
eighteen
grains
of
manna
i
took
one
of
these
pills
every
morning
drinking
a
large
glass
of
curds
after
it
and
in
the
evening
i
had
another
pill
with
barley
water
and
this
was
the
only
sustenance
i
had
this
heroic
treatment
gave
me
back
my
health
in
two
months
and
a
half
in
which
i
suffered
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
i
did
not
begin
to
put
on
flesh
and
get
back
my
strength
till
the
end
of
the
year
it
was
during
this
time
that
i
heard
about
costa
flight
with
my
diamonds
watches
linen
rich
suits
and
a
hundred
louis
which
madame
had
given
him
for
the
journey
the
worthy
lady
sent
me
a
bill
of
exchange
for
fifty
thousand
francs
which
she
had
happily
not
entrusted
to
the
robber
and
the
money
rescued
me
very
opportunely
from
the
state
to
which
my
imprudence
had
reduced
me
at
this
period
i
made
another
discovery
of
an
extremely
vexatious
character
namely
that
le
duc
had
robbed
me
i
would
have
forgiven
him
if
he
had
not
forced
me
to
a
public
exposure
which
i
could
only
have
avoided
with
the
loss
of
my
honour
however
i
kept
him
in
my
service
till
my
return
to
paris
at
the
commencement
of
the
following
year
towards
the
end
of
september
when
everybody
knew
that
the
congress
would
not
take
place
the
renaud
passed
through
augsburg
with
desarrnoises
on
her
way
to
paris
but
she
dared
not
come
and
see
me
for
fear
i
should
make
her
return
my
goods
of
which
she
had
taken
possession
without
telling
me
four
or
five
years
later
she
married
a
man
named
bohmer
the
same
that
gave
the
cardinal
de
rohan
the
famous
necklace
which
he
supposed
was
destined
for
the
unfortunate
marie
antoinette
the
renaud
was
at
paris
when
i
returned
but
i
made
no
endeavour
to
see
her
as
i
wished
if
possible
to
forget
the
past
i
had
every
reason
to
do
so
for
amongst
all
the
misfortunes
i
had
gone
through
during
that
wretched
year
the
person
i
found
most
at
fault
was
myself
nevertheless
i
would
have
given
myself
the
pleasure
of
cutting
off
desarmoises
ears
but
the
old
rascal
who
no
doubt
foresaw
what
kind
of
treatment
i
was
likely
to
mete
to
him
made
his
escape
shortly
after
he
died
miserably
of
consumption
in
normandy
my
health
had
scarcely
returned
when
i
forgot
all
my
woes
and
began
once
more
to
amuse
myself
my
excellent
cook
anna
midel
who
had
been
idle
so
long
had
to
work
hard
to
satisfy
my
ravenous
appetite
my
landlord
and
pretty
gertrude
his
daughter
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
as
i
ate

results
algardi
who
had
saved
my
life
prophesied
a
dyspepsia
which
would
bring
me
to
the
tomb
but
my
need
of
food
was
stronger
than
his
arguments
to
which
i
paid
no
kind
of
attention
and
i
was
right
for
i
required
an
immense
quantity
of
nourishment
to
recover
my
former
state
and
i
soon
felt
in
a
condition
to
renew
my
sacrifices
to
the
deity
for
whom
i
had
suffered
so
much
i
fell
in
love
with
the
cook
and
gertrude
who
were
both
young
and
pretty
i
imparted
my
love
to
both
of
them
at
once
for
i
had
foreseen
that
if
i
attacked
them
separately
i
should
conquer
neither
besides
i
felt
that
i
had
not
much
time
to
lose
as
i
had
promised
to
sup
with
madame
on
the
first
night
of
the
year
in
a
suite
of
rooms
she
had
furnished
for
me
in
the
rue
de
bac
she
had
adorned
the
rooms
with
superb
tapestry
made
for
rene
of
savoy
on
which
were
depicted
all
the
operations
of
the
great
work
she
wrote
to
me
that
she
had
heard
that
santis
had
recovered
from
the
wound
i
had
given
him
and
had
been
committed

occupied

leisure
moments
agreeably
enough
during
the
rest
of
my
stay
at
augsburg
but
they
did
not
make
me
neglect
society
i
spent
my
evenings
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
with
count
max
de
lamberg
who
occupied
the
position
of
to
the
his
wife
had
all
the
attractions
which
collect
good
company
together
at
this
house
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
baron
von
selentin
a
captain
in
the
prussian
service
who
was
recruiting
for
the
king
of
prussia
at
augsburg
i
was
particularly
drawn
to
the
count
lamberg
by
his
taste
for
literature
he
was
an
extremely
learned
man
and
has
published
some
excellent
works
i
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
him
till
his
death
by
his
own
fault
in
four
years
from
the
time
of
my
writing
i
say
by
his
fault
but
i
should
have
said
by
the
fault
of
his
doctors
who
treated
him
mercurially
for
a
disease
which
was
not
venereal
and
this
treatment
not
only
killed
him
but
took
away
his
good
name
his
widow
is
still
alive
and
lives
in
bavaria
loved
by
her
friends
and
her
daughters
who
all
made
excellent
marriages
at
this
time
a
miserable
company
of
italian
actors
made
their
appearance
in
augsburg
and
i
got
them
permission
to
play
in
a
small
and
wretched
theatre
as
this
was
the
occasion
of
an
incident
which
diverted
me
the
hero
i
shall
impart
it
to
my
readers
in
the
hope
of
its
amusing

the

the

from
strasburg
the
female
count
my
return
to

i
go
to
metz
pretty
raton
the
pretended
countess
lascaris
a
woman
ugly
enough
but
lively
like
all
italians
called
on
me
and
asked
me
to
intercede
with
the
police
to
obtain
permission
for
her
company
to
act
in
augsburg
in
spite
of
her
ugliness
she
was
a
poor
and
without
asking
her
name
or
ascertaining
whether
the
company
was
good
or
bad
i
promised
to
do
my
best
and
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
favour
i
went
to
the
first
performance
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
the
chief
actor
was
a
venetian
and
a
of
mine
twenty
years
before
at
cyprian
college
his
name
was
bassi
and
like
myself
he
had
given
up
the
priesthood
fortune
had
made
an
actor
of
him
and
he
looked
wretched
enough
while
i
the
adventurer
had
a
prosperous
air
i
felt
curious
to
hear
his
adventures
and
i
was
also
actuated
by
that
feeling
of
kindliness
which
draws
one
towards
the
companions
of
youthful
and
especially
one
school
days
so
i
went
to
the
back
as
soon
as
the
curtain
fell
he
recognized
me
directly
gave
a
joyful
cry
and
after
he
had
embraced
me
he
introduced
me
to
his
wife
the
woman
who
had
called
on
me
and
to
his
daughter
a
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
whose
dancing
had
delighted
me
he
did
not
stop
here
but
turning
to
his
mates
of
whom
he
was
chief
introduced
me
to
them
as
his
best
friend
these
worthy
people
seeing
me
dressed
like
a
lord
with
a
cross
on
my
breast
took
me
for
a
cosmopolitan
charlatan
who
was
expected
at
augsburg
and
bassi
strange
to
say
did
not
undeceive
them
when
the
company
had
taken
off
its
stage
rags
and
put
on
its
everyday
rags
bassi
ugly
wife
took
me
by
the
arm
and
said
i
must
come
and
sup
with
her
i
let
myself
be
led
and
we
soon
got
to
just
the
kind
of
room
i
had
imagined
it
was
a
huge
room
on
the
ground
floor
which
served
for
kitchen
and
bedroom
all
at
once
in
the
middle
stood
a
long
table
part
of
which
was
covered
with
a
cloth
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
in
use
for
a
month
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
somebody
was
washing
certain
earthenware
dishes
in
a
dirty
pan
this
den
was
lighted
by
one
candle
stuck
in
the
neck
of
a
broken
bottle
and
as
there
were
no
snuffers
bassi
wife
snuffed
it
cleverly
with
her
finger
and
thumb
wiping
her
hand
on
the
after
throwing
the
burnt
wick
on
the
floor
an
actor
with
long
moustaches
who
played
the
villain
in
the
various
pieces
served
an
enormous
dish
of
meat
swimming
in
a
sea
of
dirty
water
dignified
with
the
name
of
sauce
and
the
hungry
family
proceeded
to
tear
pieces
of
bread
off
the
loaf
with
their
fingers
or
teeth
and
then
to
dip
them
in
the
dish
but
as
all
did
the
same
no
one
had
a
right
to
be
disgusted
a
large
pot
of
ale
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
with
all
this
misery
mirth
displayed
itself
on
every
countenance
and
i
had
to
ask
myself
what
is
happiness
for
a
second
course
there
was
a
dish
of
fried
pork
which
was
devoured
with
great
relish
bassi
was
kind
enough
not
to
press
me
to
take
part
in
this
banquet
and
i
felt
obliged
to
him
the
meal
over
he
proceeded
to
impart
to
me
his
adventures
which
were
ordinary
enough
and
like
those
which
many
a
poor
devil
has
to
undergo
and
while
he
talked
his
pretty
daughter
sat
on
my
knee
bassi
brought
his
story
to
an
end
by
saying
that
he
was
going
to
venice
for
the
carnival
and
was
sure
of
making
a
lot
of
money
i
wished
him
all
the
luck
he
could
desire
and
on
his
asking
me
what
profession
i
followed
the
fancy
took
me
to
reply
that
i
was
a
doctor
that
a
better
trade
than
mine
said
he
and
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
give
you
a
valuable
present
what
is
that
i
asked
the
receipt
for
the
venetian
specific
which
you
can
sell
at
two
florins
a
pound
while
it
will
only
cost
you
four
gros
i
shall
be
delighted
but
tell
me
how
is
the
treasury
well
i
ca
complain
for
a
first
night
i
have
paid
all
expenses
and
have
given
my
actors
a
florin
apiece
but
i
am
sure
i
do
know
how
i
am
to
play
as
the
company
has
rebelled
they
say
they
wo
act
unless
i
give
each
of
them
a
florin
in
advance
they
do
ask
very
much
however
i
know
that
but
i
have
no
money
and
nothing
to
pledge
but
they
will
be
sorry
for
it
afterwards
as
i
am
sure
i
shall
make
at
least
fifty
florins
how
many
are
there
in
the
company
fourteen
including
my
family
could
you
lend
me
ten
florins
i
would
pay
you
back
tomorrow
night
certainly
but
i
should
like
to
have
you
all
to
supper
at
the
nearest
inn
to
the
theatre
here
are
the
ten
florins
the
poor
devil
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
said
he
would
order
supper
at
a
florin
a
head
according
to
my
instructions
i
thought
the
sight
of
fourteen
famished
actors
sitting
down
to
a
good
supper
would
be
rather
amusing
the
company
gave
a
play
the
next
evening
but
as
only
thirty
or
at
most
forty
people
were
present
poor
bassi
did
not
know
where
to
turn
to
pay
for
the
lighting
and
the
orchestra
he
was
in
despair
and
instead
of
returning
my
ten
florins
he
begged
me
to
lend
him
another
ten
still
in
the
hope
of
a
good
house
next
time
i
consoled
him
by
saying
we
would
talk
it
over
after
supper
and
that
i
would
go
to
the
inn
to
wait
for
my
guests
i
made
the
supper
last
three
hours
by
dint
of
passing
the
bottle
freely
my
reason
was
that
i
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
a
young
girl
from
strasburg
who
played
singing
her
features
were
exquisite
and
her
voice
charming
while
she
made
me
split
my
sides
with
laughing
at
her
italian
pronounced
with
an
alsatian
accent
and
at
her
gestures
which
were
of
the
most
comic
description
i
was
determined
to
possess
her
in
the
course
of
the
next
hours
and
before
the
party
broke
up
i
spoke
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
will
engage
you
myself
for
a
week
at
fifty
florins
a
day
on
the
condition
that
you
acknowledge
me
as
your
manager
for
the
time
being
and
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
theatre
you
must
charge
the
prices
i
name
for
seats
five
members
of
the
company
to
be
chosen
by
me
must
sup
with
me
every
evening
if
the
receipts
amount
to
more
than
fifty
florins
we
will
share
the
overplus
between
us
my
proposal
was
welcomed
with
shouts
of
joy
and
i
called
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
drew
up
the
agreement
for
i
said
to
bassi
the
prices
for
admission
shall
remain
the
same
but
the
day
after
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
you
and
your
family
will
sup
with
me
as
also
the
young
alsatian
whom
i
could
never
separate
from
her
dear
harlequin
he
issued
bills
of
an
enticing
description
for
the
following
evening
but
in
spite
of
all
the
pit
only
contained
a
score
of
common
people
and
nearly
all
the
boxes
were
empty
bassi
had
done
his
best
and
when
we
met
at
supper
he
came
up
to
me
looking
extremely
confused
and
gave
me
ten
or
twelve
florins
courage
said
i
and
i
proceeded
to
share
them
among
the
guests
present
we
had
a
good
supper
and
i
kept
them
at
table
till
midnight
giving
them
plenty
of
choice
wine
and
playing
a
thousand
pranks
with
bassi
daughter
and
the
young
alsatian
who
sat
one
on
each
side
of
me
i
did
not
heed
the
jealous
harlequin
who
seemed
not
to
relish
my
familiarities
with
his
sweetheart
the
latter
lent
herself
to
my
endearments
with
a
bad
enough
grace
as
she
hoped
harlequin
would
marry
her
and
consequently
did
not
want
to
vex
him
when
supper
was
over
we
rose
and
i
took
her
between
my
arms
laughing
and
caressing
her
in
a
manner
which
seemed
too
suggestive
to
the
lover
who
tried
to
pull
me
away
i
thought
this
rather
too
much
in
my
turn
and
seizing
him
by
his
shoulders
i
dismissed
him
with
a
hearty
kick
which
he
received
with
great
humility
however
the
situation
assumed
a
melancholy
aspect
for
the
poor
girl
began
to
weep
bitterly
bassi
and
his
wife
two
hardened
sinners
laughed
at
her
tears
and
bassi
daughter
said
that
her
lover
had
offered
me
great
provocation
but
the
young
alsatian
continued
weeping
and
told
me
that
she
would
never
sup
with
me
again
if
i
did
not
make
her
lover
return
i
will
see
to
all
that
said
i
and
four
sequins
soon
made
her
all
smiles
again
she
even
tried
to
shew
me
that
she
was
not
really
cruel
and
that
she
would
be
still
less
so
if
i
could
manage
the
jealous
harlequin
i
promised
everything
and
she
did
her
best
to
convince
me
that
she
would
be
quite
complaisant
on
the
first
opportunity
i
ordered
bassi
to
give
notice
that
the
pit
would
be
two
florins
and
the
boxes
a
ducat
but
that
the
gallery
would
be
opened
freely
to
the
first
comers
we
shall
have
nobody
there
said
he
looking
alarmed
maybe
but
that
remains
to
be
seen
you
must
request
twelve
soldiers
to
keep
order
and
i
will
pay
for
them
we
shall
want
some
soldiers
to
look
after
the
mob
which
will
besiege
the
gallery
but
as
for
the
rest
of
the
house
again
i
tell
you
we
shall
see
carry
out
my
instructions
and
whether
they
prove
successful
or
no
we
will
have
a
merry
supper
as
usual
the
next
day
i
called
upon
the
harlequin
in
his
little
den
of
a
room
and
with
two
louis
and
a
promise
to
respect
his
mistress
i
made
him
as
soft
as
a
glove
bassi
bills
made
everybody
laugh
people
said
he
must
be
mad
but
when
it
was
ascertained
that
it
was
the
lessee
speculation
and
that
i
was
the
lessee
the
accusation
of
madness
was
turned
on
me
but
what
did
i
care
at
night
the
gallery
was
full
an
hour
before
the
rise
of
the
curtain
but
the
pit
was
empty
and
there
was
nobody
in
the
boxes
with
the
exception
of
count
lamberg
a
genoese
abbe
named
bolo
and
a
young
man
who
appeared
to
me
a
woman
in
disguise
the
actors
surpassed
themselves
and
the
thunders
of
applause
from
the
gallery
enlivened
the
performance
when
we
got
to
the
inn
bassi
gave
me
the
three
ducats
for
the
three
boxes
but
of
course
i
returned
them
to
him
it
was
quite
a
little
fortune
for
the
poor
actors
i
sat
down
at
table
between
bassi
wife
and
daughter
leaving
the
alsatian
to
her
lover
i
told
the
manager
to
persevere
in
the
same
course
and
to
let
those
laugh
who
would
and
i
made
him
promise
to
play
all
his
best
pieces
when
the
supper
and
the
wine
had
sufficiently
raised
my
spirits
i
devoted
my
attention
to
bassi
daughter
who
let
me
do
what
i
liked
while
her
father
and
mother
only
laughed
and
the
silly
harlequin
fretted
and
fumed
at
not
being
able
to
take
the
same
liberties
with
his
dulcinea
but
at
the
end
of
supper
when
i
had
made
the
girl
in
a
state
of
nature
i
myself
being
dressed
like
adam
before
he
ate
the
fatal
apple
harlequin
rose
and
taking
his
sweetheart
arm
was
going
to
draw
her
away
i
imperiously
told
him
to
sit
down
and
he
obeyed
me
in
amazement
contenting
himself
with
turning
his
back
his
sweetheart
did
not
follow
his
example
and
so
placed
herself
on
the
pretext
of
defending
my
victim
that
she
increased
my
enjoyment
while
my
vagrant
hand
did
not
seem
to
displease
her
the
scene
excited
bassi
wife
and
she
begged
her
husband
to
give
her
a
proof
of
his
love
for
her
to
which
request
he
acceded
while
modest
harlequin
sat
by
the
fire
with
his
head
on
his
hands
the
alsatian
was
in
a
highly
excited
state
and
took
advantage
of
her
lover
position
to
grant
me
all
i
wished
so
i
proceeded
to
execute
the
great
work
with
her
and
the
violent
movements
of
her
body
proved
that
she
was
taking
as
active
a
part
in
it
as
myself
when
the
orgy
was
over
i
emptied
my
purse
on
the
table
and
enjoyed
the
eagerness
with
which
they
shared
a
score
of
sequins
this
indulgence
at
a
time
when
i
had
not
yet
recovered
my
full
strength
made
me
enjoy
a
long
sleep
just
as
i
awoke
i
was
handed
a
summons
to
appear
before
the
burgomaster
i
made
haste
with
my
toilette
for
i
felt
curious
to
know
the
reason
of
this
citation
and
i
was
aware
i
had
nothing
to
fear
when
i
appeared
the
magistrate
addressed
me
in
german
to
which
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
for
i
only
knew
enough
of
that
language
to
ask
for
necessaries
when
he
was
informed
of
my
ignorance
of
german
he
addressed
me
in
latin
not
of
the
ciceronian
kind
by
any
means
but
in
that
peculiar
dialect
which
obtains
at
most
of
the
german
universities
why
do
you
bear
a
false
name
he
asked
my
name
is
not
false
you
can
ask
carli
the
banker
who
has
paid
me
fifty
thousand
florins
i
know
that
but
your
name
is
casanova
so
why
do
you
call
yourself
seingalt
i
take
this
name
or
rather
i
have
taken
it
because
it
belongs
to
me
and
in
such
a
manner
that
if
anyone
else
dared
to
take
it
i
should
contest
it
as
my
property
by
every
legitimate
resource
ah
and
how
does
this
name
belong
to
you
because
i
invented
it
but
that
does
not
prevent
my
being
casanova
as
well
sir
you
must
choose
between
casanova
and
seingalt
a
man
can
not
have
two
names
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
often
have
half
a
dozen
names
but
you
are
not
a
spaniard
or
a
portuguese
you
are
an
italian
and
after
all
how
can
one
invent
a
name
it
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
kindly
explain
the
alphabet
belongs
equally
to
the
whole
human
race
no
one
can
deny
that
i
have
taken
eight
letters
and
combined
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
the
word
seingalt
it
pleased
me
and
i
have
adopted
it
as
my
surname
being
firmly
persuaded
that
as
no
one
had
borne
it
before
no
one
could
deprive
me
of
it
or
carry
it
without
my
consent
this
is
a
very
odd
idea
your
arguments
are
rather
specious
than
well
grounded
for
your
name
ought
to
be
none
other
than
your
father
name
i
suggest
that
there
you
are
mistaken
the
name
you
yourself
bear
because
your
father
bore
it
before
you
has
not
existed
from
all
eternity
it
must
have
been
invented
by
an
ancestor
of
yours
who
did
not
get
it
from
his
father
or
else
your
name
would
have
been
adam
does
your
worship
agree
to
that
i
am
obliged
to
but
all
this
is
strange
very
strange
you
are
again
mistaken
it
quite
an
old
custom
and
i
engage
to
give
you
by
a
long
list
of
names
invented
by
worthy
people
still
living
who
are
allowed
to
enjoy
their
names
in
peace
and
quietness
without
being
cited
to
the
town
hall
to
explain
how
they
got
them
but
you
will
confess
that
there
are
laws
against
false
names
yes
but
i
repeat
this
name
is
my
true
name
your
name
which
i
honour
though
i
do
not
know
it
can
not
be
more
true
than
mine
for
it
is
possible
that
you
are
not
the
son
of
the
gentleman
you
consider
your
father
he
smiled
and
escorted
me
out
telling
me
that
he
would
make
enquiries
about
me
of
carli
i
took
the
part
of
going
to
carli
myself
the
story
made
him
laugh
he
told
me
that
the
burgomaster
was
a
catholic
a
worthy
man
well
to
do
but
rather
in
short
a
fine
subject
for
a
joke
the
following
morning
carli
asked
me
to
breakfast
and
afterwards
to
dine
with
the
burgomaster
i
saw
him
yesterday
said
he
and
we
had
a
long
talk
in
the
course
of
which
i
succeeded
in
convincing
him
on
the
question
of
names
and
he
is
now
quite
of
your
opinion
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
pleasure
as
i
was
sure
of
seeing
some
good
company
i
was
not
undeceived
there
were
some
charming
women
and
several
agreeable
men
amongst
others
i
noticed
the
woman
in
man
dress
i
had
seen
at
the
theatre
i
watched
her
at
dinner
and
i
was
the
more
convinced
that
she
was
a
woman
nevertheless
everybody
addressed
her
as
a
man
and
she
played
the
part
to
admiration
i
however
being
in
search
of
amusement
and
not
caring
to
seem
as
if
i
were
taken
in
began
to
talk
to
her
in
a
stream
of
gallantry
as
one
talks
to
a
woman
and
i
contrived
to
let
her
know
that
if
i
were
not
sure
of
her
sex
i
had
very
strong
suspicions
she
pretended
not
to
understand
me
and
everyone
laughed
at
my
feigned
expression
of
offence
after
dinner
while
we
were
taking
coffee
the
pretended
gentleman
shewed
a
canon
who
was
present
a
portrait
on
one
of
her
rings
it
represented
a
young
lady
who
was
in
the
company
and
was
an
excellent
likeness
an
easy
enough
matter
as
she
was
very
ugly
my
conviction
was
not
disturbed
but
when
i
saw
the
imposter
kissing
the
young
lady
hand
with
mingled
affection
and
respect
i
ceased
jesting
on
the
question
of
her
sex
carli
took
me
aside
for
a
moment
and
told
me
that
in
spite
of
his
effeminate
appearance
this
individual
was
a
man
and
was
shortly
going
to
marry
the
young
lady
whose
hand
he
had
just
kissed
it
may
be
so
said
i
but
i
ca
believe
it
all
the
same
however
the
pair
were
married
during
the
carnival
and
the
husband
obtained
a
rich
dowry
with
his
wife
the
poor
girl
died
of
in
the
course
of
a
year
but
did
not
say
a
word
till
she
was
on
her
her
foolish
parents
ashamed
of
having
been
deceived
so
grossly
dared
not
say
anything
and
got
the
female
swindler
out
of
the
way
she
had
taken
good
care
however
to
lay
a
firm
hold
on
the
dowry
the
story
became
known
and
gave
the
good
folk
of
augsburg
much
amusement
while
i
became
renowned
for
my
sagacity
in
piercing
the
disguise
i
continued
to
enjoy
the
society
of
my
two
servants
and
of
the
fair
alsation
who
cost
me
a
hundred
louis
at
the
end
of
a
week
my
agreement
with
bassi
came
to
an
end
leaving
him
with
some
money
in
his
pocket
he
continued
to
give
performances
returning
to
the
usual
prices
and
suppressing
the
free
gallery
he
did
very
fair
business
i
left
augsburg
towards
the
middle
of
december
i
was
vexed
on
account
of
gertrude
who
believed
herself
with
child
but
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
accompany
me
to
france
her
father
would
have
been
pleased
for
me
to
take
her
he
had
no
hopes
of
getting
her
a
husband
and
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
get
rid
of
her
by
my
making
her
my
mistress
we
shall
hear
more
of
her
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
years
as
also
of
my
excellent
cook
anna
midel
to
whom
i
gave
a
present
of
four
hundred
florins
she
married
shortly
afterwards
and
when
i
visited
the
town
again
i
found
her
unhappy
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
forgive
le
duc
who
rode
on
the
box
and
when
we
were
in
paris
along
the
rue
antoine
i
made
him
take
his
trunk
and
get
down
and
i
left
him
there
without
a
character
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
i
never
heard
of
him
again
but
i
still
miss
him
for
in
spite
of
his
great
failings
he
was
an
excellent
servant
perhaps
i
should
have
called
to
mind
the
important
services
he
had
rendered
me
at
stuttgart
soleure
naples
florence
and
turin
but
i
could
not
pass
over
his
impudence
in
compromising
me
before
the
augsburg
magistrate
if
i
had
not
succeeded
in
bringing
a
certain
theft
home
to
him
it
would
have
been
laid
to
my
door
and
i
should
have
been
dishonoured
i
had
done
a
good
deal
in
saving
him
from
justice
and
besides
i
had
rewarded
him
liberally
for
all
the
special
services
he
had
done
me
from
augsburg
i
went
to
bale
by
way
of
constance
where
i
stayed
at
the
dearest
inn
in
switzerland
the
landlord
imhoff
was
the
prince
of
cheats
but
his
daughters
were
amusing
and
after
a
three
days
stay
i
continued
my
journey
i
got
to
paris
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
and
i
left
the
coach
at
the
house
in
the
rue
du
bacq
where
my
good
angel
madame
had
arranged
me
a
suite
of
rooms
with
the
utmost
elegance
i
spent
three
weeks
in
these
rooms
without
going
anywhere
in
order
to
convince
the
worthy
lady
that
i
had
only
returned
to
paris
to
keep
my
word
to
her
and
make
her
be
born
again
a
man
we
spent
the
three
weeks
in
making
preparations
for
this
divine
operation
and
our
preparations
consisted
of
devotions
to
each
of
the
seven
planets
on
the
days
consecrated
to
each
of
the
intelligences
after
this
i
had
to
seek
in
a
place
which
the
spirits
would
point
out
to
me
for
a
maiden
the
daughter
of
an
adept
whom
i
was
to
impregnate
with
a
male
child
in
a
manner
only
known
to
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
madame
was
to
receive
the
child
into
her
arms
the
moment
it
was
born
and
to
keep
it
beside
her
in
bed
for
seven
days
at
the
end
of
the
seven
days
she
would
die
with
her
lips
on
the
lips
of
the
child
who
would
thus
receive
her
reasonable
soul
whereas
before
it
had
only
possessed
a
vegetal
soul
this
being
done
it
was
to
be
my
part
to
care
for
the
child
with
the
magisterium
which
was
known
to
me
and
as
soon
as
it
had
attained
to
its
third
year
madame
would
begin
to
recover
her
and
then
i
was
to
begin
to
initiate
her
in
the
perfect
knowledge
of
the
great
work
the
operation
must
take
place
under
the
full
moon
during
the
months
of
april
may
or
june
above
all
madame
was
to
make
a
will
in
favour
of
the
child
whose
guardian
i
was
to
be
till
its
thirteenth
year
this
sublime
madwoman
had
no
doubts
whatever
as
to
the
truth
of
all
this
and
burned
with
impatience
to
see
the
virgin
who
was
destined
to
be
the
vessel
of
election
she
begged
me
to
hasten
my
departure
i
had
hoped
in
obtaining
my
answers
from
the
oracle
that
she
would
be
deterred
by
the
prospect
of
death
and
i
reckoned
on
the
natural
love
of
life
making
her
defer
the
operation
for
an
indefinite
period
but
such
was
not
the
case
and
i
found
myself
obliged
to
keep
my
word
in
appearance
at
all
events
and
to
go
on
my
quest
for
the
mysterious
virgin
what
i
wanted
was
some
young
hussy
whom
i
could
teach
the
part
and
i
thought
of
the
corticelli
she
had
been
at
prague
for
the
last
nine
months
and
when
we
were
at
bologna
i
had
promised
to
come
and
see
her
before
the
end
of
the
year
but
as
i
was
leaving
germany
by
no
means
a
land
of
pleasant
memories
to
me
i
did
not
think
it
was
worth
while
going
out
of
my
way
for
such
a
trifle
in
the
depth
of
winter
i
resolved
to
send
her
enough
money
for
the
journey
and
to
let
her
meet
me
in
some
french
town
de
fouquet
a
friend
of
madame
was
governor
of
metz
and
i
felt
sure
that
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
madame
this
nobleman
would
give
me
a
distinguished
reception
besides
his
nephew
the
comte
de
lastic
whom
i
knew
well
was
there
with
his
regiment
for
these
reasons
i
chose
metz
as
a
with
the
virgin
corticelli
to
whom
this
new
part
would
certainly
be
a
surprise
madame
gave
me
the
necessary
introductions
and
i
left
paris
on
january
loaded
with
presents
i
had
a
letter
of
credit
to
a
large
amount
but
i
did
not
make
use
of
it
as
my
purse
was
abundantly
replenished
i
took
no
servant
for
after
costa
robbing
me
and
le
duc
cheating
me
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
trust
in
anyone
i
got
to
metz
in
two
days
and
put
up
at
the
roi
dagobert
an
excellent
inn
where
i
found
the
comte
de
louvenhaupt
a
swede
whom
i
had
met
at
the
house
of
the
princess
of
mother
of
the
empress
of
russia
he
asked
me
to
sup
with
him
and
the
duc
de
deux
pants
who
was
travelling
incognito
to
paris
to
visit
louis
whose
constant
friend
he
was
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
took
my
letters
to
the
governor
who
told
me
i
must
dine
with
him
every
day
de
lastic
had
left
metz
much
to
my
regret
as
he
would
have
contributed
in
no
small
degree
to
the
pleasure
of
my
stay
the
same
day
i
wrote
to
the
corticelli
sending
her
fifty
louis
and
telling
her
to
come
with
her
mother
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
get
someone
who
knew
the
way
to
accompany
her
she
could
not
leaves
prague
before
the
beginning
of
lent
and
to
make
sure
of
her
coming
i
promised
that
i
would
make
her
fortune
in
four
or
five
days
i
knew
my
way
about
the
town
but
i
did
not
frequent
polite
assemblies
preferring
to
go
to
the
theatre
where
a
comic
opera
singer
had
captivated
me
her
name
was
raton
and
she
was
only
fifteen
after
the
fashion
of
actresses
who
always
subtract
at
least
two
or
three
years
from
their
age
however
this
failing
is
common
to
women
and
is
a
pardonable
one
since
to
be
youthful
is
the
greatest
of
all
advantages
to
them
raton
was
not
so
much
handsome
as
attractive
but
what
chiefly
made
her
an
object
of
desire
was
the
fact
that
she
had
put
the
price
of
louis
on
her
maidenhead
one
could
spend
a
night
with
her
and
make
the
trial
for
a
louis
the
were
only
to
be
paid
on
the
accomplishment
of
the
great
work
it
was
notorious
that
numerous
officers
in
the
army
and
young
barristers
had
undertaken
the
operation
unsuccessfully
and
all
of
them
had
paid
a
louis
apiece
this
singular
case
was
enough
to
whet
my
curiosity
i
was
not
long
before
i
called
on
raton
but
not
wishing
to
be
duped
by
her
i
took
due
precautions
i
told
her
that
she
must
come
and
sup
with
me
and
that
i
would
give
her
the
louis
if
my
happiness
was
complete
and
that
if
i
were
unsuccessful
she
should
have
six
louis
instead
of
one
provided
that
she
was
not
tied
her
aunt
assured
me
that
this
was
not
the
case
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
victorine
raton
came
to
supper
with
her
aunt
who
went
to
bed
in
an
adjoining
closet
when
the
dessert
was
brought
in
the
girl
figure
was
exquisitely
beautiful
and
i
felt
that
i
had
no
small
task
before
me
she
was
kind
laughing
and
defied
me
to
the
conquest
of
a
fleece
not
of
gold
but
of
ebony
which
the
youth
of
metz
had
assaulted
in
vain
perhaps
the
reader
will
think
that
i
who
was
no
longer
in
my
first
vigour
was
discouraged
by
the
thought
of
the
many
who
had
failed
but
i
knew
my
powers
and
it
only
amused
me
her
former
lovers
had
been
frenchmen
more
skilled
in
carrying
strong
places
by
assault
than
in
eluding
the
artfulness
of
a
girl
who
corked
herself
up
i
was
an
italian
and
knew
all
about
that
so
i
had
no
doubts
as
to
my
victory
however
my
preparations
were
superfluous
for
as
soon
as
raton
felt
from
my
mode
of
attack
that
the
trick
would
be
of
no
avail
she
met
my
desires
without
trying
the
device
which
had
made
her
seem
to
be
what
she
was
no
longer
to
her
inexpert
lovers
she
gave
herself
up
in
good
faith
and
when
i
had
promised
to
keep
the
secret
her
ardours
were
equal
to
mine
it
was
not
her
first
trial
and
i
consequently
need
not
have
given
her
the
louis
but
i
was
well
satisfied
and
not
caring
much
for
maidenheads
rewarded
her
as
if
i
had
been
the
first
to
bite
at
the
cherry
i
kept
raton
at
a
louis
a
day
till
the
arrival
of
the
corticelli
and
she
had
to
be
faithful
to
me
as
i
never
let
her
go
out
of
my
sight
i
liked
the
girl
so
well
and
found
her
so
pleasant
that
i
was
sorry
that
the
corticelli
was
coming
however
i
was
told
of
her
arrival
one
night
just
as
i
was
leaving
my
box
at
the
theatre
my
footman
told
me
in
a
loud
voice
that
my
lady
wife
my
daughter
and
a
gentleman
had
just
arrived
from
frankfort
and
were
awaiting
me
at
the
inn
idiot
i
exclaimed
i
have
no
wife
and
no
daughter
however
all
metz
heard
that
my
family
had
arrived
the
corticelli
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
laughing
as
usual
and
her
mother
presented
me
to
the
worthy
man
who
had
accompanied
them
from
prague
to
metz
he
was
an
italian
named
month
who
had
lived
for
a
long
time
at
prague
where
he
taught
his
native
language
i
saw
that
month
and
the
old
woman
were
suitably
accommodated
and
i
then
led
the
young
fool
into
my
room
i
found
her
changed
for
the
better
she
had
grown
her
shape
was
improved
and
her
pleasant
manners
made
her
a
very
charming
girl

journey
to
sulzbach
why
did
you
allow
your
mother
to
call
herself
my
wife
little
simpleton
do
you
think
that
a
compliment
to
my
judgment
she
might
have
given
herself
out
for
your
governess
as
she
wishes
to
pass
you
off
as
my
daughter
my
mother
is
an
obstinate
old
woman
who
had
rather
be
whipped
at
the
than
call
herself
my
governess
she
has
very
narrow
ideas
and
always
thinks
that
governess
and
procuress
mean
the
same
thing
she
an
old
fool
but
we
will
make
her
hear
reason
either
with
her
will
or
in
spite
of
it
but
you
look
well
dressed
have
you
made
your
fortune
at
prague
i
captivated
the
affections
of
count
n
and
he
proved
a
generous
lover
but
let
your
first
action
be
to
send
back
month
the
worthy
man
has
his
family
at
prague
to
look
after
he
ca
afford
to
stay
long
here
true
i
will
see
about
it
directly
the
coach
started
for
frankfort
the
same
evening
and
summoning
month
i
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
paid
him
generously
so
he
went
off
well
pleased
i
had
nothing
further
to
do
at
metz
so
i
took
leave
of
my
new
friends
and
in
two
days
time
i
was
at
nancy
where
i
wrote
to
madame
that
i
was
on
my
way
back
with
a
virgin
the
last
of
the
family
of
lascaris
who
had
once
reigned
at
constantinople
i
begged
her
to
receive
her
from
my
hands
at
a
country
house
which
belonged
to
her
where
we
should
be
occupied
for
some
days
in
cabalistic
ceremonies
she
answered
that
she
would
await
us
at
an
old
castle
four
leagues
distant
from
paris
and
that
she
would
welcome
the
young
princess
with
all
possible
kindness
i
owe
her
all
the
more
friendship
added
the
sublime
madwoman
as
the
family
of
lascaris
is
connected
with
the
family
of
and
as
i
am
to
be
born
again
in
the
seed
of
the
happy
virgin
i
felt
that
my
task
would
be
not
exactly
to
throw
cold
water
on
her
enthusiasm
but
to
hold
it
in
check
and
to
moderate
its
manifestations
i
therefore
explained
to
her
by
return
of
post
that
she
must
be
content
to
treat
the
virgin
as
a
countess
not
a
princess
and
i
ended
by
informing
her
that
we
should
arrive
accompanied
by
the
countess
governess
on
the
monday
of
holy
week
i
spent
twelve
days
at
nancy
instructing
the
young
madcap
in
the
part
she
had
to
play
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
her
mother
that
she
must
content
herself
with
being
the
countess
lascaris
humble
servant
it
was
a
task
of
immense
difficulty
it
was
not
enough
to
shew
her
that
our
success
depended
on
her
submitting
i
had
to
threaten
to
send
her
back
to
bologna
by
herself
i
had
good
reason
to
repent
of
my
perseverance
that
woman
obstinacy
was
an
inspiration
of
my
good
angel
bidding
me
avoid
the
greatest
mistake
i
ever
made
on
the
day
appointed
we
reached
madame
whom
i
had
advised
of
the
exact
hour
of
our
arrival
had
the
drawbridge
of
the
castle
lowered
and
stood
in
the
archway
in
the
midst
of
her
people
like
a
general
surrendering
with
all
the
honours
of
war
the
dear
lady
whose
madness
was
but
an
excess
of
wit
gave
the
false
princess
so
distinguished
a
reception
that
she
would
have
shewn
her
amazement
if
i
had
not
warned
her
of
what
she
might
expect
thrice
did
she
clasp
her
to
her
breast
with
a
tenderness
that
was
quite
maternal
calling
her
her
beloved
niece
and
explaining
the
entire
pedigrees
of
the
families
of
lascaris
and
to
make
the
countess
understand
how
she
came
to
be
her
niece
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
the
polite
and
dignified
air
with
which
the
italian
wench
listened
to
all
this
she
did
not
even
smile
though
the
scene
must
have
struck
her
as
extremely
laughable
as
soon
as
we
got
into
the
castle
madame
proceeded
to
cense
the
who
received
the
attention
with
all
the
dignity
of
an
opera
queen
and
then
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
priestess
who
received
her
with
enthusiastic
affection
at
dinner
the
countess
was
agreeable
and
talkative
which
won
her
madame
entire
favour
her
broken
french
being
easily
accounted
for
laura
the
countess
mother
only
knew
her
native
italian
and
so
kept
silence
she
was
given
a
comfortable
room
where
her
meals
were
brought
to
her
and
which
she
only
left
to
hear
mass
the
castle
was
a
fortified
building
and
had
sustained
several
sieges
in
the
civil
wars
as
its
name
indicated
it
was
square
and
was
flanked
by
four
crenelated
towers
and
surrounded
by
a
broad
moat
the
rooms
were
vast
and
richly
furnished
in
an
way
the
air
was
full
of
venomous
gnats
who
devoured
us
and
covered
our
faces
with
painful
bites
but
i
had
agreed
to
spend
a
week
there
and
i
should
have
been
hard
put
to
it
to
find
a
pretext
for
shortening
the
time
madame
had
a
bed
next
her
own
for
her
niece
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
her
attempting
to
satisfy
herself
as
to
the
countess
virginity
as
the
oracle
had
expressly
forbidden
it
under
pain
or
failure
the
operation
was
fixed
for
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
april
moon
on
that
day
we
had
a
temperate
supper
after
which
i
went
to
bed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
madame
came
leading
the
virgin
lascaris
she
undressed
her
scented
her
cast
a
lovely
veil
over
her
body
and
when
the
countess
was
laid
beside
me
she
remained
wishing
to
be
present
at
an
operation
which
was
to
result
in
her
being
born
again
in
the
course
of
nine
months
the
act
was
consummated
in
form
and
then
madame
left
us
alone
for
the
rest
of
the
night
which
was
well
employed
afterwards
the
countess
slept
with
her
aunt
till
the
last
day
of
the
moon
when
i
asked
the
oracle
if
the
countess
lascaris
had
conceived
that
well
might
be
for
i
had
spared
nothing
to
that
intent
but
i
thought
it
more
prudent
to
make
the
oracle
reply
that
the
operation
had
failed
because
the
small
count
had
watched
us
behind
a
screen
madame
was
in
despair
but
i
consoled
her
by
a
second
reply
in
which
the
oracle
declared
that
though
the
operation
could
only
be
performed
in
france
in
april
it
could
take
place
out
of
that
realm
in
may
but
the
inquisitive
young
count
whose
influence
had
proved
so
fatal
must
be
sent
for
at
least
a
year
to
some
place
a
hundred
leagues
from
paris
the
oracle
also
indicated
the
manner
in
which
he
was
to
travel
he
was
to
have
a
tutor
a
servant
and
all
in
order
the
oracle
had
spoken
and
no
more
was
wanted
madame
thought
of
an
abbe
she
liked
for
his
tutor
and
the
count
was
sent
to
lyons
with
strong
letters
of
commendation
to
de
rochebaron
a
relation
of
his
patroness
the
young
man
was
delighted
to
travel
and
never
had
any
suspicion
of
the
way
in
which
i
had
slandered
him
it
was
not
a
mere
fancy
which
suggested
this
course
of
action
i
had
discovered
that
the
corticelli
was
making
up
to
him
and
that
her
mother
favoured
the
intrigue
i
had
surprised
her
twice
in
the
young
man
room
and
though
he
only
cared
for
the
girl
as
a
youth
cares
for
all
girls
the
signora
laura
did
not
at
all
approve
of
my
opposing
her
daughter
designs
our
next
task
was
to
fix
on
some
foreign
town
where
we
could
again
attempt
the
mysterious
operation
we
settled
on
and
in
five
or
six
days
all
was
ready
for
the
journey
the
corticeili
angry
with
me
for
having
thwarted
her
in
her
projects
reproached
me
bitterly
and
from
that
time
began
to
be
my
enemy
she
even
allowed
herself
to
threaten
me
if
i
did
not
get
back
the
pretty
boy
as
she
called
him
you
have
no
business
to
be
jealous
said
she
and
i
am
the
mistress
of
my
own
actions
quite
right
my
dear
i
answered
but
it
is
my
business
to
see
that
you
do
not
behave
like
a
prostitute
in
your
present
position
the
mother
was
in
a
furious
rage
and
said
that
she
and
her
daughter
would
return
to
bologna
and
to
quiet
them
i
promised
to
take
them
there
myself
as
soon
as
we
had
been
to
nevertheless
i
did
not
feel
at
ease
and
to
prevent
any
plots
taking
place
i
hastened
our
departure
we
started
in
may
in
a
travelling
carriage
containing
madame
myself
the
false
lascaris
and
her
maid
and
favourite
named
brougnole
we
were
followed
by
a
coach
with
two
seats
in
it
were
the
signora
laura
and
another
servant
two
in
full
livery
sat
on
the
outside
of
our
travelling
carriage
we
stopped
a
day
at
brussels
and
another
at
liege
at
aix
there
were
many
distinguished
visitors
and
at
the
first
ball
we
attended
madame
presented
the
lascaris
to
two
princesses
of
mecklenburg
as
her
niece
the
false
countess
received
their
embraces
with
much
ease
and
modesty
and
attracted
the
particular
attention
of
the
margrave
of
baireuth
and
the
duchess
of
wurtemberg
his
daughter
who
took
possession
of
her
and
did
not
leave
her
till
the
end
of
the
ball
i
was
on
thorns
the
whole
time
in
terror
lest
the
heroine
might
make
some
dreadful
slip
she
danced
so
gracefully
that
everybody
gazed
at
her
and
i
was
the
person
who
was
complimented
on
her
performance
i
suffered
a
martyrdom
for
these
compliments
seemed
to
be
given
with
malicious
intent
i
suspected
that
the
had
been
discovered
beneath
the
countess
and
i
felt
myself
dishonoured
i
succeeded
in
speaking
privately
to
the
young
wanton
for
a
moment
and
begged
her
to
dance
like
a
young
lady
and
not
like
a
chorus
girl
but
she
was
proud
of
her
success
and
dared
to
tell
me
that
a
young
lady
might
know
how
to
dance
as
well
as
a
professional
dancer
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
dance
badly
to
please
me
i
was
so
enraged
with
her
impudence
that
i
would
have
cast
her
off
that
instant
if
it
had
been
possible
but
as
it
was
not
i
determined
that
her
punishment
should
lose
none
of
its
sharpness
by
waiting
and
whether
it
be
a
vice
or
a
virtue
the
desire
of
revenge
is
never
extinguished
in
my
heart
till
it
is
satisfied
the
day
after
the
ball
madame
presented
her
with
a
casket
containing
a
beautiful
watch
set
with
brilliants
a
pair
of
diamond
and
a
ring
containing
a
ruby
of
fifteen
carats
the
whole
was
worth
sixty
thousand
francs
i
took
possession
of
it
to
prevent
her
going
off
without
my
leave
in
the
meanwhile
i
amused
myself
with
play
and
making
bad
acquaintances
the
worst
of
all
was
a
french
officer
named
who
had
a
pretty
wife
and
a
daughter
prettier
still
before
long
the
daughter
had
taken
possession
of
the
heart
which
the
corticelli
had
lost
but
as
soon
as
madame
saw
that
i
preferred
her
daughter
to
herself
she
refused
to
receive
me
at
her
house
i
had
lent
ten
louis
and
i
consequently
felt
myself
entitled
to
complain
of
his
wife
conduct
but
he
answered
rudely
that
as
i
only
went
to
the
house
after
his
daughter
his
wife
was
quite
right
that
he
intended
his
daughter
to
make
a
good
match
and
that
if
my
intentions
were
honourable
i
had
only
to
speak
to
the
mother
his
manner
was
still
more
offensive
than
his
words
and
i
felt
enraged
but
knowing
the
brutal
drunken
characteristics
of
the
man
and
that
he
was
always
ready
to
draw
cold
steel
for
a
yes
or
a
no
i
was
silent
and
resolved
to
forget
the
girl
not
caring
to
become
involved
with
a
man
like
her
father
i
had
almost
cured
myself
of
my
fancy
when
a
few
days
after
our
conversation
i
happened
to
go
into
a
where
was
playing
with
a
swiss
named
schmit
an
officer
in
the
swedish
army
as
soon
as
saw
me
he
asked
whether
i
would
lay
the
ten
louis
he
owed
me
against
him
yes
said
i
that
will
make
double
or
quits
towards
the
end
of
the
match
made
an
unfair
stroke
which
was
so
evident
that
the
marker
told
him
of
it
but
as
this
stroke
made
him
the
winner
seized
the
stakes
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
without
heeding
the
marker
or
the
other
player
who
seeing
himself
cheated
before
his
very
eyes
gave
the
rascal
a
blow
across
the
face
with
his
cue
parried
the
blow
with
his
hand
and
drawing
his
sword
rushed
at
schmit
who
had
no
arms
the
marker
a
sturdy
young
fellow
caught
hold
of
round
the
body
and
thus
prevented
murder
the
swiss
went
out
saying
we
shall
see
each
other
again
the
rascally
frenchman
cooled
down
and
said
to
me
now
you
see
we
are
quits
very
much
quits
that
all
very
well
but
by
god
you
might
have
prevented
the
insult
which
has
dishonoured
me
i
might
have
done
so
but
i
did
not
care
to
interfere
you
are
strong
enough
to
look
after
yourself
schmit
had
not
his
sword
but
i
believe
him
to
be
a
brave
man
and
he
will
give
you
satisfaction
if
you
will
return
him
his
money
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
you
lost
the
match
an
officer
named
de
pyene
took
me
up
and
said
that
he
himself
would
give
me
the
twenty
louis
which
had
taken
but
that
the
swiss
must
give
satisfaction
i
had
no
hesitation
in
promising
that
he
would
do
so
and
said
i
would
bring
a
reply
to
the
challenge
the
next
morning
i
had
no
fears
myself
the
man
of
honour
ought
always
to
be
ready
to
use
the
sword
to
defend
himself
from
insult
or
to
give
satisfaction
for
an
insult
he
has
offered
i
know
that
the
law
of
duelling
is
a
prejudice
which
may
be
called
and
perhaps
rightly
barbarous
but
it
is
a
prejudice
which
no
man
of
honour
can
contend
against
and
i
believed
schmit
to
be
a
thorough
gentleman
i
called
on
him
at
and
found
him
still
in
bed
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
said
i
am
sure
you
have
come
to
ask
me
to
fight
with
i
am
quite
ready
to
burn
powder
with
him
but
he
must
first
pay
me
the
twenty
louis
he
robbed
me
of
you
shall
have
them
and
i
will
attend
you
will
be
seconded
by
de
pyene
very
good
i
shall
expect
you
at
two
hours
after
i
saw
de
pyene
and
we
fixed
the
meeting
for
the
next
day
at
six
in
the
morning
the
arms
were
to
be
pistols
we
chose
a
garden
half
a
league
from
the
town
as
the
scene
of
the
combat
at
i
found
the
swiss
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
of
his
lodgings
carolling
the
so
dear
to
his
i
thought
that
a
good
omen
here
you
are
said
he
let
us
be
off
then
on
the
way
he
observed
i
have
only
fought
with
men
of
honour
up
to
now
and
i
do
much
care
for
killing
a
rascal
it
hangman
work
i
know
i
replied
that
it
very
hard
to
have
to
risk
one
life
against
a
fellow
like
that
there
no
risk
said
schmit
with
a
laugh
i
am
certain
that
i
shall
kill
him
how
can
you
be
certain
i
shall
make
him
tremble
he
was
right
this
secret
is
infallible
when
it
is
applied
to
a
coward
we
found
and
de
pyene
on
the
field
and
five
or
six
others
who
must
have
been
present
from
motives
of
curiosity
took
twenty
louis
from
his
pocket
and
gave
them
to
his
enemy
saying
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
hope
to
make
you
pay
dearly
for
your
brutality
then
turning
to
me
he
said
i
owe
you
twenty
louis
also
but
i
made
no
reply
schmit
put
the
money
in
his
purse
with
the
calmest
air
imaginable
and
making
no
reply
to
the
other
boast
placed
himself
between
two
trees
distant
about
four
paces
from
one
another
and
drawing
two
pistols
from
his
pocket
said
to
place
yourself
at
a
distance
of
ten
paces
and
fire
first
i
shall
walk
to
and
fro
between
these
two
trees
and
you
may
walk
as
far
if
you
like
to
do
so
when
my
turn
comes
to
fire
nothing
could
be
clearer
or
more
calmly
delivered
than
this
explanation
but
we
must
decide
said
i
who
is
to
have
the
first
shot
there
is
no
need
said
schmit
i
never
fire
first
besides
the
gentleman
has
a
right
to
the
first
shot
de
pyene
placed
his
friend
at
the
proper
distance
and
then
stepped
aside
and
fired
on
his
antagonist
who
was
walking
slowly
to
and
fro
without
looking
at
him
schmit
turned
round
in
the
coolest
manner
possible
and
said
you
have
missed
me
sir
i
knew
you
would
try
again
i
thought
he
was
mad
and
that
some
arrangement
would
be
come
to
but
nothing
of
the
kind
fired
a
second
time
and
again
missed
and
schmit
without
a
word
but
as
calm
as
death
fired
his
first
pistol
in
the
air
and
then
covering
with
his
second
pistol
hit
him
in
the
forehead
and
stretched
him
dead
on
the
ground
he
put
back
his
pistols
into
his
pocket
and
went
off
directly
by
himself
as
if
he
were
merely
continuing
his
walk
in
two
minutes
i
followed
his
example
after
ascertaining
that
the
unfortunate
no
longer
breathed
i
was
in
a
state
of
amazement
such
a
duel
was
more
like
a
combat
of
romance
than
a
real
fact
i
could
not
understand
it
i
had
watched
the
swiss
and
had
not
noticed
the
slightest
change
pass
over
his
face
i
breakfasted
with
madame
whom
i
found
inconsolable
it
was
the
full
moon
and
at
three
minutes
past
four
exactly
i
ought
to
perform
the
mysterious
creation
of
the
child
in
which
she
was
to
be
born
again
but
the
lascaris
on
whom
the
work
was
to
be
wrought
was
twisting
and
turning
in
her
bed
contorting
herself
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
accomplish
the
prolific
work
my
grief
when
i
heard
what
had
happened
was
hypocritical
in
the
first
place
because
i
no
longer
felt
any
desire
for
the
girl
and
in
the
second
because
i
thought
i
saw
a
way
in
which
i
could
make
use
of
the
incident
to
take
vengeance
on
her
i
lavished
consolations
on
madame
and
on
consulting
the
oracle
i
found
that
the
lascaris
had
been
defiled
by
an
evil
genius
and
that
i
must
search
for
another
virgin
whose
purity
must
be
under
the
protection
of
more
powerful
spirits
i
saw
that
my
madwoman
was
perfectly
happy
with
this
and
i
left
her
to
visit
the
corticelli
whom
i
found
in
bed
with
her
mother
beside
her
you
have
convulsions
have
you
dearest
said
i
no
i
have
i
am
quite
well
but
all
the
same
i
shall
have
them
till
you
give
me
back
my
you
are
getting
wicked
my
poor
child
this
comes
of
following
your
mother
advice
as
for
the
casket
if
you
are
going
to
behave
like
this
probably
you
will
have
it
i
will
reveal
all
you
will
not
be
believed
and
i
shall
send
you
back
to
bologna
without
letting
you
take
any
of
the
presents
which
madame
has
given
you
you
ought
to
have
given
me
back
the
casket
when
i
declared
myself
with
child
signora
laura
told
me
that
this
was
only
too
true
though
i
was
not
the
father
who
is
then
i
asked
count
n
whose
mistress
she
was
at
prague
it
did
not
seem
probable
as
she
had
no
symptoms
of
pregnancy
still
it
might
be
so
i
was
obliged
to
plot
myself
to
bring
the
plots
of
these
two
rascally
women
to
nought
and
without
saying
anything
to
them
i
shut
myself
up
with
madame
to
enquire
of
the
oracle
concerning
the
operation
which
was
to
make
her
happy
after
several
answers
more
obscure
than
any
returned
from
the
oracular
tripod
at
delphi
the
interpretation
of
which
i
left
to
the
infatuated
madame
she
discovered
herself
and
i
took
care
not
to
contradict
her
that
the
countess
lascaris
had
gone
mad
i
encouraged
her
fears
and
succeeded
in
making
her
obtain
from
a
cabalistic
pyramid
the
statement
that
the
reason
the
princess
had
not
conceived
was
that
she
had
been
defiled
by
an
evil
genius
an
enemy
of
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
this
put
madame
fairly
on
the
way
and
she
added
on
her
own
account
that
the
girl
must
be
with
child
by
a
gnome
she
then
erected
another
pyramid
to
obtain
guidance
on
our
quest
and
i
so
directed
things
that
the
answer
came
that
she
must
write
to
the
moon
this
mad
reply
which
should
have
brought
her
to
her
senses
only
made
her
more
crazy
than
ever
she
was
quite
ecstatic
and
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
endeavoured
to
shew
her
the
nothingness
of
all
this
i
show
have
had
nothing
for
my
trouble
her
conclusion
would
probably
have
been
that
i
was
possessed
by
an
evil
spirit
and
was
no
longer
a
true
rosy
cross
but
i
had
no
idea
of
undertaking
a
cure
which
would
have
done
me
harm
and
her
no
her
chimerical
notions
made
her
happy
and
the
cold
naked
truth
would
doubtless
have
made
her
unhappy
she
received
the
order
to
write
to
the
moon
with
the
greater
delight
as
she
knew
what
ceremonies
were
to
be
observed
in
addressing
that
planet
but
she
could
not
dispense
with
the
assistance
of
an
adept
and
i
knew
she
would
reckon
on
me
i
told
her
i
should
always
be
ready
to
serve
her
but
that
as
she
knew
herself
we
should
have
to
wait
for
the
first
phase
of
the
new
moon
i
was
very
glad
to
gain
time
for
i
had
lost
heavily
at
play
and
i
could
not
leave
before
a
bill
which
i
had
drawn
on
of
amsterdam
was
cashed
in
the
mean
time
we
agreed
that
as
the
countess
lascaris
had
become
mad
we
must
not
pay
any
attention
to
what
she
might
say
as
the
words
would
not
be
hers
but
would
proceed
from
the
evil
spirit
who
possessed
her
nevertheless
we
determined
that
as
her
state
was
a
pitiable
one
and
should
be
as
much
alleviated
as
possible
she
should
continue
to
dine
with
us
but
that
in
the
evening
she
was
to
go
to
her
governess
and
sleep
with
her
after
having
thus
disposed
of
madame
to
disbelieve
whatever
the
corticelli
cared
to
tell
her
and
to
concentrate
all
her
energies
on
the
task
of
writing
to
selenis
the
intelligence
of
the
moon
i
set
myself
seriously
to
work
to
regain
the
money
i
had
lost
at
play
and
here
my
cabala
was
no
good
to
me
i
pledged
the
corticelli
casket
for
a
thousand
louis
and
proceeded
to
play
in
an
english
club
where
i
had
a
much
better
chance
of
winning
than
with
germans
or
frenchmen
three
or
four
days
after
death
his
widow
wrote
me
a
note
begging
me
to
call
on
her
i
found
her
in
company
with
de
pyene
she
told
me
in
a
lugubrious
voice
that
her
husband
had
left
many
debts
unsettled
and
that
his
creditors
had
seized
everything
she
possessed
and
that
she
was
thus
unable
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
journey
though
she
wanted
to
take
her
daughter
with
her
to
colmar
and
there
to
rejoin
her
family
you
caused
my
husband
death
she
added
and
i
ask
you
to
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
if
you
refuse
me
i
shall
commence
a
lawsuit
against
you
for
as
the
swiss
officer
has
left
you
are
the
only
person
i
can
prosecute
i
am
surprised
at
your
taking
such
a
tone
towards
me
i
replied
coldly
and
were
it
not
for
the
respect
i
feel
for
your
misfortune
i
should
answer
as
bitterly
as
you
deserve
in
the
first
place
i
have
not
a
thousand
crowns
to
throw
away
and
if
i
had
i
would
not
sacrifice
my
money
to
threats
i
am
curious
to
know
what
kind
of
a
case
you
could
get
up
against
me
in
the
courts
of
law
as
for
schmit
he
fought
like
a
brave
gentleman
and
i
do
think
you
could
get
much
out
of
him
if
he
were
still
here
madam
i
had
scarcely
got
fifty
paces
from
the
house
when
i
was
joined
by
de
pyene
who
said
that
rather
than
madame
should
have
to
complain
of
me
he
would
cut
my
throat
on
the
spot
we
neither
of
us
had
swords
your
intention
is
not
a
very
flattering
one
said
i
and
there
is
something
rather
brutal
about
it
i
had
rather
not
have
any
affair
of
the
kind
with
a
man
whom
i
do
know
and
to
whom
i
owe
nothing
you
are
a
coward
i
would
be
you
mean
if
i
were
to
imitate
you
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
what
opinion
you
may
have
on
the
subject
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
maybe
but
i
warn
you
that
i
never
go
out
unattended
by
a
pair
of
pistols
which
i
keep
in
good
order
and
know
how
to
use
so
saying
i
shewd
him
the
pistols
and
took
one
in
my
right
hand
at
this
the
bully
uttered
an
oath
and
we
separated
at
a
short
distance
from
the
place
where
this
scene
had
occurred
i
met
a
neapolitan
named
maliterni
a
and
aide
to
the
prince
de
condo
of
the
french
army
this
maliterni
was
a
boon
companion
always
ready
to
oblige
and
always
short
of
money
we
were
friends
and
i
told
him
what
had
happened
i
should
be
sorry
said
i
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
fellow
like
de
pyene
and
if
you
can
rid
me
of
him
i
promise
you
a
hundred
crowns
i
daresay
that
can
be
managed
he
replied
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
can
do
in
point
of
fact
he
brought
me
news
the
next
day
that
my
had
received
orders
from
his
superior
officer
to
leave
at
and
at
the
same
time
he
gave
me
a
passport
from
the
prince
de
conde
i
confess
that
this
was
very
pleasant
tidings
i
have
never
feared
to
cross
my
sword
with
any
man
though
never
sought
the
barbarous
pleasure
of
spilling
men
blood
but
on
this
occasion
i
felt
an
extreme
dislike
to
a
duel
with
a
fellow
who
was
probably
of
the
same
caste
as
his
friend
i
therefore
gave
maliterni
my
heartiest
thanks
as
well
as
the
hundred
crowns
i
had
promised
him
which
i
considered
so
well
employed
that
i
did
not
regret
their
loss
maliterni
who
was
a
jester
of
the
first
water
and
a
creature
of
the
marshal
was
lacking
neither
in
wit
nor
knowledge
but
he
was
deficient
in
a
sense
of
order
and
refinement
he
was
a
pleasant
companion
for
his
gaiety
was
inexhaustible
and
he
had
a
large
knowledge
of
the
world
he
attained
the
rank
of
in
and
went
to
naples
to
marry
a
rich
heiress
whom
he
left
a
widow
a
year
after
the
day
after
de
pyene
departure
i
received
a
note
from
mdlle
begging
me
for
the
sake
of
her
sick
mother
to
come
and
see
her
i
answered
that
i
would
be
at
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
and
that
she
could
say
what
she
liked
to
me
i
found
her
at
the
place
and
time
i
appointed
with
her
mother
whose
illness
it
appeared
did
not
prevent
her
from
going
out
she
called
me
her
persecutor
and
said
that
since
the
departure
of
her
best
friend
de
pyene
she
did
not
know
where
to
turn
that
she
had
pledged
all
her
belongings
and
that
i
who
was
rich
ought
to
aid
her
if
i
were
not
the
vilest
of
men
i
feel
for
your
condition
i
replied
as
i
feel
your
abuse
of
me
and
i
can
not
help
saying
that
you
have
shewn
yourself
the
vilest
of
women
in
inciting
de
pyene
who
may
be
an
honest
man
for
all
i
know
to
assassinate
me
in
fine
rich
or
not
and
though
i
owe
you
nothing
i
will
give
you
enough
money
to
take
your
property
out
of
pawn
and
i
may
possibly
take
you
to
colmar
myself
but
you
must
first
consent
to
my
giving
your
charming
daughter
a
proof
of
my
affection
and
you
dare
to
make
this
horrible
proposal
to
me
horrible
or
not
i
do
make
it
i
will
never
consent
good
day
madam
i
called
the
waiter
to
pay
him
for
the
refreshments
i
had
ordered
and
i
gave
the
girl
six
double
louis
but
her
proud
mother
forbade
her
to
accept
the
money
from
me
i
was
not
surprised
in
spite
of
her
distress
for
the
mother
was
in
reality
still
more
charming
than
the
daughter
and
she
knew
it
i
ought
to
have
given
her
the
preference
and
thus
have
ended
the
dispute
but
who
can
account
for
his
whims
i
felt
that
she
must
hate
me
for
she
did
not
care
for
her
daughter
and
it
must
have
humiliated
her
bitterly
to
be
obliged
to
regard
her
as
a
victorious
rival
i
left
them
still
holding
the
six
double
louis
which
pride
or
scorn
had
refused
and
i
went
to
the
and
decided
in
sacrificing
them
to
fortune
but
that
capricious
deity
as
proud
as
the
haughty
widow
refused
them
and
though
i
left
them
on
the
board
for
five
deals
i
almost
broke
the
bank
an
englishman
named
martin
offered
to
go
shares
with
me
and
i
accepted
as
i
knew
he
was
a
good
player
and
in
the
course
of
eight
or
ten
days
we
did
such
good
business
that
i
was
not
only
able
to
take
the
casket
out
of
pledge
and
to
cover
all
losses
but
made
a
considerable
profit
in
addition
about
this
period
the
corticelli
in
her
rage
against
me
had
told
madame
the
whole
history
of
her
life
of
our
acquaintance
and
of
her
pregnancy
but
the
more
truthfully
she
told
her
story
so
much
the
more
did
the
good
lady
believe
her
to
be
mad
and
we
often
laughed
together
at
the
extraordinary
fancies
of
the
traitress
madame
put
all
her
trust
in
the
instructions
which
selenis
would
give
in
reply
to
her
letter
nevertheless
as
the
girl
conduct
displeased
me
i
made
her
eat
her
meals
with
her
mother
while
i
kept
madame
company
i
assured
her
that
we
should
easily
find
another
vessel
of
election
the
madness
of
the
countess
lascaris
having
made
her
absolutely
incapable
of
participating
in
our
mysterious
rites
before
long
widow
found
herself
obliged
to
give
me
her
mimi
but
i
won
her
by
kindness
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
mother
could
pretend
with
decency
to
know
nothing
about
it
i
redeemed
all
the
goods
she
had
pawned
and
although
the
daughter
had
not
yet
yielded
entirely
to
my
ardour
i
formed
the
plan
of
taking
them
to
colmar
with
madame
to
make
up
the
good
lady
mind
i
resolved
to
let
that
be
one
of
the
instructions
from
the
moon
and
this
she
would
not
only
obey
blindly
but
would
have
no
suspicions
as
to
my
motive
i
managed
the
correspondence
between
selenis
and
madame
in
the
following
manner
on
the
day
appointed
we
supped
together
in
a
garden
beyond
the
town
walls
and
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
i
had
made
all
the
necessary
preparations
the
letter
which
was
to
fall
from
the
moon
in
reply
to
madame
epistle
being
in
my
pocket
at
a
little
distance
from
the
chamber
of
ceremonies
i
had
placed
a
large
bath
filled
with
lukewarm
water
and
perfumes
pleasing
to
the
deity
of
the
night
into
which
we
were
to
plunge
at
the
hour
of
the
moon
which
fell
at
one
when
we
had
burnt
incense
and
sprinkled
the
essences
appropriate
to
the
cult
of
selenis
we
took
off
all
our
clothes
and
holding
the
letter
concealed
in
my
left
hand
with
the
right
i
graciously
led
madame
to
the
brink
of
the
bath
here
stood
an
alabaster
cup
containing
spirits
of
wine
which
i
kindled
repeating
magical
words
which
i
did
not
understand
but
which
she
said
after
me
giving
me
the
letter
addressed
to
selenis
i
burnt
the
letter
in
the
flame
of
the
spirits
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
credulous
lady
told
me
she
saw
the
characters
she
had
traced
ascending
in
the
rays
of
the
planet
we
then
got
into
the
bath
and
the
letter
which
was
written
in
silver
characters
on
green
paper
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
as
soon
as
madame
saw
it
she
picked
it
up
reverently
and
got
out
of
the
bath
with
me
we
dried
and
scented
ourselves
and
proceeded
to
put
on
our
clothes
as
soon
as
we
were
in
a
state
of
decency
i
told
madame
that
she
might
read
the
epistle
which
she
had
placed
on
a
scented
silk
cushion
she
obeyed
and
i
saw
sadness
visibly
expressed
on
her
features
when
she
saw
that
her
hypostasis
was
deferred
till
the
arrival
of
querilinthus
whom
she
would
see
with
me
at
marseilles
in
the
spring
of
next
year
the
genius
also
said
that
the
countess
lascaris
could
not
only
do
her
harm
and
that
she
should
consult
me
as
to
the
best
means
of
getting
rid
of
her
the
letter
ended
by
ordering
her
not
to
leave
at
aix
a
lady
who
had
lost
her
husband
and
had
a
daughter
who
was
destined
to
be
of
great
service
to
the
fraternity
of
the
she
was
to
take
them
to
alsace
and
not
to
leave
them
till
they
were
there
and
safe
from
that
danger
which
threatened
them
if
they
were
left
to
themselves
madame
who
with
all
her
folly
was
an
exceedingly
benevolent
woman
commended
the
widow
to
my
care
enthusiastically
and
seemed
impatient
to
hear
her
whole
history
i
told
her
all
the
circumstances
which
i
thought
would
strengthen
her
in
her
resolution
to
befriend
them
and
promised
to
introduce
the
ladies
to
them
at
the
first
opportunity
we
returned
to
aix
and
spent
the
night
in
discussing
the
phantoms
which
coursed
through
her
brain
all
was
going
on
well
and
my
only
care
was
for
the
journey
to
aix
and
how
to
obtain
the
complete
enjoyment
of
mimi
after
having
so
well
deserved
her
favours
i
had
a
run
of
luck
at
play
the
next
day
and
in
the
evening
i
gave
madame
an
agreeable
surprise
by
telling
her
that
i
should
accompany
her
and
her
mimi
to
colmar
i
told
her
that
i
should
begin
by
introducing
her
to
the
lady
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
accompany
and
i
begged
her
to
be
ready
by
the
next
day
as
the
marchioness
was
impatient
to
see
her
i
could
see
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
for
she
thought
madame
was
in
love
with
me
and
she
could
not
understand
her
desire
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
two
ladies
who
might
be
dangerous
rivals
i
conducted
them
to
madame
at
the
appointed
hour
and
they
were
received
with
a
warmth
which
surprised
them
exceedingly
for
they
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
their
recommendation
came
from
the
moon
we
made
a
party
of
four
and
while
the
two
ladies
talked
together
in
the
fashion
of
ladies
who
have
seen
the
world
i
paid
mimi
a
particular
attention
which
her
mother
understood
very
well
but
which
madame
attributed
to
the
young
lady
connection
with
the
rosy
cross
in
the
evening
we
all
went
to
a
ball
and
there
the
corticelli
who
was
always
trying
to
annoy
me
danced
as
no
young
lady
would
dance
she
executed
rapid
steps
pirouetted
cut
capers
and
shewed
her
legs
in
short
she
behaved
like
a
i
was
on
thorns
an
officer
who
either
ignored
or
pretended
to
ignore
my
supposed
relation
to
her
asked
me
if
she
was
a
professional
dancer
i
heard
another
man
behind
me
say
that
he
thought
he
remembered
seeing
her
on
the
boards
at
prague
i
resolved
on
hastening
my
departure
as
i
foresaw
that
if
i
stayed
much
longer
at
aix
the
wretched
girl
would
end
by
costing
me
my
life
as
i
have
said
madame
had
a
good
society
manner
and
this
put
her
in
madame
good
graces
who
saw
in
her
politeness
a
new
proof
of
the
favour
of
selenis
madame
felt
i
suppose
that
she
awed
me
some
return
after
all
i
had
done
for
her
and
left
the
ball
early
so
that
when
i
took
mimi
home
i
found
myself
alone
with
her
and
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
what
i
liked
i
profited
by
the
opportunity
and
remained
with
mimi
for
two
hours
finding
her
so
complaisant
and
even
passionate
that
when
i
left
her
i
had
nothing
more
to
desire
in
three
days
time
i
provided
the
mother
and
daughter
with
their
outfit
and
we
left
aix
gladly
in
an
elegant
and
convenient
travelling
carriage
which
i
had
provided
half
an
hour
before
we
left
i
made
an
acquaintance
which
afterwards
proved
fatal
to
me
a
flemish
officer
unknown
to
me
accosted
me
and
painted
his
destitute
condition
in
such
sad
colours
that
i
felt
obliged
to
give
him
twelve
louis
ten
minutes
after
he
gave
me
a
paper
in
which
he
acknowledged
the
debt
and
named
the
time
in
which
he
could
pay
it
from
the
paper
i
ascertained
that
his
name
was
malingan
in
ten
months
the
reader
will
hear
the
results
just
as
we
were
starting
i
shewed
the
corticelli
a
carriage
with
four
places
in
which
she
her
mother
and
the
two
maids
were
to
travel
at
this
she
trembled
her
pride
was
wounded
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
she
was
going
out
of
her
mind
she
rained
sobs
abuse
and
curses
on
me
i
stood
the
storm
unmoved
however
and
madame
only
laughed
at
her
niece
paroxysms
and
seemed
delighted
to
find
herself
sitting
opposite
to
me
with
the
servant
of
selenis
beside
her
while
mimi
was
highly
pleased
to
be
so
close
to
me
we
got
to
liege
at
nightfall
on
the
next
day
and
i
contrived
to
make
madame
stay
there
the
day
following
wishing
to
get
horses
to
take
us
through
the
ardennes
and
thus
to
have
the
charming
mimi
longer
in
my
possession
i
rose
early
and
went
out
to
see
the
town
by
the
great
bridge
a
woman
so
wrapped
up
in
a
black
mantilla
that
only
the
tip
of
her
nose
was
visible
accosted
me
and
asked
me
to
follow
her
into
a
house
with
an
open
door
which
she
shewed
me
as
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
i
replied
prudence
will
not
allow
me
to
do
so
you
do
know
me
though
she
replied
and
taking
me
to
the
corner
of
a
neighbouring
street
she
shewed
me
her
face
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
the
fair
stuart
of
avignon
the
statue
of
the
fountain
of
vaucluse
i
was
very
glad
to
meet
her
in
my
curiosity
i
followed
her
into
the
house
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
where
she
welcomed
me
most
tenderly
it
was
all
no
good
for
i
felt
angry
with
her
and
despised
her
advances
no
doubt
because
i
had
mimi
and
wished
to
keep
all
my
love
for
her
however
i
took
three
louis
out
of
my
purse
and
gave
them
to
her
asking
her
to
tell
me
her
history
stuart
she
said
was
only
my
keeper
my
real
name
is
ranson
and
i
am
the
mistress
of
a
rich
landed
proprietor
i
got
back
to
liege
after
many
sufferings
i
am
delighted
to
hear
that
you
are
more
prosperous
now
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
your
behaviour
at
avignon
was
both
preposterous
and
absurd
but
the
subject
is
not
worth
discussing
good
day
madam
i
then
returned
to
my
hotel
to
write
an
account
of
what
i
had
seen
to
the
marquis
grimaldi
the
next
day
we
left
liege
and
were
two
days
passing
through
the
ardennes
this
is
one
of
the
strangest
tracts
in
europe
a
vast
forest
the
traditions
of
which
furnished
ariosto
with
some
splendid
passages
there
is
no
town
in
the
forest
and
though
one
is
obliged
to
cross
it
to
pass
from
one
country
to
another
hardly
any
of
the
necessaries
of
life
are
to
be
found
in
it
the
enquirer
will
seek
in
vain
for
vices
or
virtues
or
manners
of
any
kind
the
inhabitants
are
devoid
of
correct
ideas
but
have
wild
notions
of
their
own
on
the
power
of
men
they
style
scholars
it
is
enough
to
be
a
doctor
to
enjoy
the
reputation
of
an
astrologer
and
a
wizard
nevertheless
the
ardennes
have
a
large
population
as
i
was
assured
that
there
were
twelve
hundred
churches
in
the
forest
the
people
are
and
even
pleasant
especially
the
young
girls
but
as
a
general
rule
the
fair
sex
is
by
no
means
fair
in
those
quarters
in
this
vast
district
watered
by
the
meuse
is
the
town
of
bouillon
a
regular
hole
but
in
my
time
it
was
the
freest
place
in
europe
the
duke
of
bouillon
was
so
jealous
of
his
rights
that
he
preferred
the
exercise
of
his
prerogatives
to
all
the
honours
he
might
have
enjoyed
at
the
court
of
france
we
stayed
a
day
at
metz
but
did
not
call
on
anyone
and
in
three
days
we
reached
colmar
where
we
left
madame
whose
good
graces
i
had
completely
won
her
family
in
extremely
comfortable
circumstances
received
the
mother
and
daughter
with
great
affection
mimi
wept
bitterly
when
i
left
her
but
i
consoled
her
by
saying
that
i
would
come
back
before
long
madame
seemed
not
to
mind
leaving
them
and
i
consoled
myself
easily
enough
while
congratulating
myself
on
having
made
mother
and
daughter
happy
i
adored
the
secret
paths
and
ways
of
divine
providence
on
the
following
day
we
went
to
sulzbach
where
the
baron
of
schaumburg
who
knew
madame
gave
us
a
warm
welcome
i
should
have
been
sadly
boared
in
this
dull
place
if
it
had
not
been
for
gaming
madame
finding
herself
in
need
of
company
encouraged
the
corticelli
to
hope
to
regain
my
good
graces
and
consequently
her
own
the
wretched
girl
seeing
how
easily
i
had
defeated
her
projects
and
to
what
a
pass
of
humiliation
i
had
brought
her
had
changed
her
part
and
was
now
submissive
enough
she
flattered
herself
that
she
would
regain
the
favour
she
had
completely
lost
and
she
thought
the
day
was
won
when
she
saw
that
madame
and
her
daughter
stayed
at
colmar
but
what
she
had
more
at
heart
than
either
my
friendship
or
madame
was
the
but
she
dared
not
ask
for
it
and
her
hopes
of
seeing
it
again
were
growing
dim
by
her
pleasantries
at
table
which
made
madame
laugh
she
succeeded
in
giving
me
a
few
amorous
twinges
but
still
i
did
not
allow
my
feelings
to
relax
my
severity
and
she
continued
to
sleep
with
her
mother
a
week
after
our
arrival
at
sulzbach
i
left
madame
with
the
baron
of
schaumburg
and
i
went
to
colmar
in
the
hope
of
good
fortune
but
i
was
disappointed
as
the
mother
and
daughter
had
both
made
arrangements
for
getting
married
a
rich
merchant
who
had
been
in
love
with
the
mother
eighteen
years
before
seeing
her
a
widow
and
still
pretty
felt
his
early
flames
revive
and
offered
his
hand
and
was
accepted
a
young
advocate
found
mimi
to
his
taste
and
asked
her
in
marriage
the
mother
and
daughter
fearing
the
results
of
my
affection
and
finding
it
would
be
a
good
match
lost
no
time
in
giving
their
consent
i
was
entertained
in
the
family
and
supped
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
and
choice
assemblage
but
seeing
that
i
should
only
annoy
the
ladies
and
tire
myself
in
waiting
for
some
chance
favour
if
i
stayed
i
bade
them
adieu
and
returned
to
sulzbach
the
next
morning
i
found
there
a
charming
girl
from
strasburg
named
salzmann
three
or
four
gamesters
who
had
come
to
drink
the
waters
and
several
ladies
to
whom
i
shall
introduce
the
reader
in
the
ensuing
chapter
chapter
xvi
i
send
the
corticelli
to
turin
helen
is
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
love
i
go
to
lyons
my
arrival
at
turin
one
of
the
ladies
madame
saxe
was
intended
by
nature
to
win
the
devotion
of
a
man
of
feeling
and
if
she
had
not
had
a
jealous
officer
in
her
train
who
never
let
her
go
out
of
his
sight
and
seemed
to
threaten
anyone
who
aspired
to
please
she
would
probably
have
had
plenty
of
admirers
this
officer
was
fond
of
piquet
but
the
lady
was
always
obliged
to
sit
close
beside
him
which
she
seemed
to
do
with
pleasure
in
the
afternoon
i
played
with
him
and
continued
doing
so
for
five
or
six
days
after
that
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
as
when
he
had
won
ten
or
twelve
louis
he
invariably
rose
and
left
me
to
myself
his
name
was
he
was
a
man
though
somewhat
thin
and
had
a
good
share
of
wit
and
knowledge
of
the
world
we
had
not
played
together
for
two
days
when
one
afternoon
he
asked
if
i
would
like
to
take
my
revenge
no
i
think
not
said
i
for
we
do
play
on
the
same
principle
i
play
for
amusement
sake
and
you
play
to
win
money
what
do
you
mean
your
words
are
offensive
i
did
mean
them
to
be
offensive
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
time
we
have
played
you
have
risen
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
ought
to
be
obliged
to
me
as
otherwise
you
would
have
lost
heavily
possibly
but
i
do
think
so
i
can
prove
it
to
you
i
accept
the
offer
but
the
first
to
leave
the
table
must
forfeit
fifty
louis
i
agree
but
money
down
i
never
play
on
credit
i
ordered
a
waiter
to
bring
cards
and
i
went
to
fetch
four
or
five
rolls
of
a
hundred
louis
each
we
began
playing
for
five
louis
the
game
each
player
putting
down
the
fifty
louis
wagered
we
began
to
play
at
three
and
at
nine
said
we
might
take
some
supper
i
am
not
hungry
i
replied
but
you
can
go
if
you
want
me
to
put
the
hundred
louis
in
my
pocket
he
laughed
at
this
and
went
on
playing
but
this
lacy
fair
scowled
at
me
though
i
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
that
all
the
guests
went
to
supper
and
returned
to
keep
us
company
till
midnight
but
at
that
hour
we
found
ourselves
alone
saw
what
kind
of
man
he
had
got
hold
of
and
said
never
a
word
while
i
only
opened
my
lips
to
score
we
played
with
the
utmost
coolness
at
six
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
taking
the
waters
began
to
assemble
we
were
applauded
for
our
determination
in
spite
of
our
grim
look
the
louis
were
on
the
table
i
had
lost
a
hundred
and
yet
the
game
was
going
in
my
favour
at
nine
the
fair
madame
saxe
put
in
an
appearance
and
shortly
after
madame
came
in
with
de
schaumburg
both
ladies
advised
us
to
take
a
cup
of
chocolate
was
the
first
to
consent
and
thinking
that
i
was
almost
done
he
said
let
us
agree
that
the
first
man
who
asks
for
food
who
absents
himself
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
who
falls
asleep
in
his
chair
loses
the
bet
i
will
take
you
at
your
word
i
replied
and
i
adhere
to
all
your
conditions
the
chocolate
came
we
took
it
and
proceeded
with
our
play
at
noon
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
but
we
both
replied
that
we
were
not
hungry
at
four
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
persuaded
into
taking
some
soup
when
came
and
we
were
still
playing
people
began
to
think
that
the
affair
was
getting
serious
and
madame
saxe
urged
us
to
divide
the
wager
who
had
won
a
hundred
louis
would
have
gladly
consented
but
i
would
not
give
in
and
de
schaumburg
pronounced
me
within
my
rights
my
adversary
might
have
abandoned
the
stake
and
still
found
himself
with
a
balance
to
the
good
but
avarice
rather
than
pride
prevented
his
doing
so
i
felt
the
loss
myself
but
what
i
cared
chiefly
about
was
the
point
of
honour
i
still
looked
fresh
while
he
resembled
a
disinterred
corpse
as
madame
saxe
urged
me
strongly
to
give
way
i
answered
that
i
felt
deeply
grieved
at
not
being
able
to
satisfy
such
a
charming
woman
but
that
there
was
a
question
of
honour
in
the
case
and
i
was
determined
not
to
yield
to
my
antagonist
if
i
sat
there
till
i
fell
dead
to
the
ground
i
had
two
objects
in
speaking
thus
i
wanted
to
frighten
him
and
to
make
him
jealous
of
me
i
felt
certain
that
a
man
in
a
passion
of
jealousy
would
be
quite
confused
and
i
hoped
his
play
would
suffer
accordingly
and
that
i
should
not
have
the
mortification
of
losing
a
hundred
louis
to
his
superior
play
though
i
won
the
fifty
louis
of
the
wager
the
fair
madame
saxe
gave
me
a
glance
of
contempt
and
left
us
but
madame
who
believed
i
was
infallible
avenged
me
by
saying
to
in
a
tone
of
the
profoundest
conviction
o
lord
i
pity
you
sir
the
company
did
not
return
after
supper
and
we
were
left
alone
to
our
play
we
played
on
all
the
night
and
i
observed
my
antagonist
face
as
closely
as
the
cards
he
began
to
lose
his
composure
and
made
mistakes
his
cards
got
mixed
up
and
his
scoring
was
wild
i
was
hardly
less
done
up
than
he
i
felt
myself
growing
weaker
and
i
hoped
to
see
him
fall
to
the
ground
every
moment
as
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
being
beaten
in
spite
of
the
superior
strength
of
my
constitution
i
had
won
back
my
money
by
and
i
cavilled
with
him
for
being
away
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
quarrel
about
nothing
irritated
him
and
roused
me
up
the
difference
of
our
natures
produced
these
different
results
and
my
stratagem
succeeded
because
it
was
impromptu
and
could
not
have
been
foreseen
in
the
same
way
in
war
sudden
stratagems
succeed
at
nine
madame
saxe
came
in
her
lover
was
losing
now
sir
she
said
to
me
you
may
fairly
yield
madam
said
i
in
hope
of
pleasing
you
i
will
gladly
divide
the
stakes
and
rise
from
the
table
the
tone
of
exaggerated
gallantry
with
which
i
pronounced
these
words
put
into
a
rage
and
he
answered
sharply
that
he
would
not
desist
till
one
of
us
was
dead
with
a
glance
at
the
lady
which
was
meant
to
be
lovelorn
but
which
must
have
been
extremely
languid
in
my
exhausted
state
i
said
you
see
madam
that
i
am
not
the
more
obstinate
of
the
two
a
dish
of
soup
was
served
to
us
but
who
was
in
the
last
stage
of
exhaustion
had
no
sooner
swallowed
the
soup
than
he
fell
from
his
chair
in
a
dead
faint
he
was
soon
taken
up
and
after
i
had
given
six
louis
to
the
marker
who
had
been
watching
for
hours
i
pocketed
the
gold
and
went
to
the
apothecary
where
i
took
a
mild
emetic
afterwards
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
for
a
few
hours
and
at
three
i
made
an
excellent
dinner
remained
in
his
room
till
the
next
day
i
expected
a
quarrel
but
the
night
brings
counsel
and
i
made
a
mistake
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
ran
up
to
me
and
embraced
me
saying
i
made
a
silly
bet
but
you
have
given
me
a
lesson
which
will
last
me
all
my
days
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
provided
that
your
health
has
not
suffered
no
i
am
quite
well
but
we
will
play
no
more
together
well
i
hope
we
sha
play
against
each
other
any
more
in
the
course
of
eight
or
ten
days
i
took
madame
and
the
pretended
lascaris
to
bale
we
put
up
at
the
inn
of
the
famous
imhoff
who
swindled
us
but
all
the
same
the
three
kings
is
the
best
inn
in
the
town
i
think
i
have
noted
that
noon
at
bale
is
at
eleven
an
absurdity
due
to
some
historic
event
which
i
had
explained
to
me
but
have
forgotten
the
inhabitants
are
said
to
be
subject
to
a
kind
of
madness
of
which
they
are
cured
by
taking
the
waters
of
sulzbach
but
they
it
again
as
soon
as
they
return
we
should
have
stayed
at
bale
some
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
incident
which
made
me
hasten
our
departure
it
was
as
follows
my
necessities
had
obliged
me
to
forgive
the
corticelli
to
a
certain
extent
and
when
i
came
home
early
i
spent
the
night
with
her
but
when
i
came
home
late
as
often
happened
i
slept
in
my
own
room
the
little
hussy
in
the
latter
case
slept
also
alone
in
a
room
next
to
her
mother
through
whose
chamber
one
had
to
pass
to
get
to
the
daughter
one
night
i
came
in
at
one
and
not
feeling
inclined
to
sleep
i
took
a
candle
and
went
in
search
of
my
charmer
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
signora
laura
door
half
open
and
just
as
i
was
going
in
the
old
woman
came
forward
and
took
me
by
the
arm
begging
me
not
to
go
into
her
daughter
room
why
said
i
she
has
been
very
poorly
all
the
evening
and
she
is
in
need
of
sleep
very
good
then
i
will
sleep
too
so
saying
i
pushed
the
mother
to
one
side
and
entering
the
girl
room
i
found
her
in
bed
with
someone
who
was
hiding
under
the
sheets
i
at
the
picture
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
laugh
and
sitting
down
on
the
bed
begged
to
enquire
the
name
of
the
happy
individual
whom
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
throwing
out
of
the
window
on
a
chair
i
saw
the
coat
trousers
hat
and
cane
of
the
gentleman
but
as
i
had
my
two
trusty
pistols
about
me
i
knew
i
had
nothing
to
fear
however
i
did
not
want
to
make
a
noise
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
trembling
all
over
the
girl
took
my
hand
and
begged
me
to
forgive
her
it
a
young
lord
said
she
and
i
do
even
know
his
name
oh
he
is
a
young
lord
is
he
and
you
do
know
his
name
you
little
hussy
do
you
well
he
will
tell
me
himself
so
saying
i
took
a
pistol
and
vigorously
stripped
the
sheets
off
the
cuckoo
who
had
got
into
my
nest
i
saw
the
face
of
a
young
man
whom
i
did
not
know
his
head
covered
with
a
nightcap
but
the
rest
perfectly
naked
as
indeed
was
my
mistress
he
turned
his
back
to
me
to
get
his
shirt
which
he
had
thrown
on
the
floor
but
seizing
him
by
the
arm
i
held
him
firmly
with
my
pistol
to
his
forehead
kindly
tell
me
your
name
fair
sir
i
am
count
b
canon
of
bale
and
do
you
think
you
have
been
performing
an
ecclesiastical
function
here
no
sir
no
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
and
the
lady
too
for
i
am
the
only
guilty
party
i
am
not
asking
you
whether
she
is
guilty
or
not
sir
the
countess
is
perfectly
innocent
i
felt
in
a
good
temper
and
far
from
being
angry
i
was
strongly
inclined
to
laugh
i
found
the
picture
before
me
an
attractive
one
it
was
amusing
and
voluptuous
the
sight
of
the
two
nudities
on
the
bed
was
a
truly
lascivious
one
and
i
remained
contemplating
it
in
silence
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
occupied
in
resisting
a
strong
temptation
to
take
off
my
clothes
and
lie
beside
them
the
only
thing
which
prevented
my
yielding
to
it
was
the
fear
that
i
might
find
the
canon
to
be
a
fool
incapable
of
playing
the
part
with
dignity
as
for
the
corticelli
she
soon
passed
from
tears
to
laughter
and
would
have
done
it
well
but
if
as
i
feared
the
canon
was
a
blockhead
i
should
have
been
degrading
myself
i
felt
certain
that
neither
of
them
had
guessed
my
thoughts
so
i
rose
and
told
the
canon
to
put
on
his
clothes
no
one
must
hear
anything
more
of
this
said
i
but
you
and
i
will
go
to
a
distance
of
two
hundred
paces
and
burn
a
little
powder
no
no
sir
cried
my
gentleman
you
may
take
me
where
you
like
and
kill
me
if
you
please
but
i
was
not
meant
for
a
fighting
man
really
yes
sir
and
i
only
became
a
priest
to
escape
the
fatal
duty
of
duelling
then
you
are
a
coward
and
will
not
object
to
a
good
thrashing
anything
you
like
but
it
would
be
cruelty
for
my
love
blinded
me
i
only
came
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
and
the
countess
and
her
governess
were
both
asleep
you
are
a
liar
i
had
only
just
taken
off
my
shirt
when
you
came
and
i
have
never
seen
this
angel
before
and
that
gospel
truth
said
the
corticelli
are
you
aware
that
you
are
a
couple
of
impudent
scoundrels
and
as
for
you
master
canon
you
deserve
to
be
roasted
like
st
laurence
in
the
meanwhile
the
wretched
ecclesiastic
had
huddled
on
his
clothes
follow
me
sir
said
i
in
a
tone
which
froze
the
marrow
of
his
bones
and
i
accordingly
took
him
to
my
room
what
will
you
do
said
i
if
i
forgive
you
and
let
you
go
without
putting
you
to
shame
i
will
leave
in
an
hour
and
a
half
and
you
shall
never
see
me
here
again
but
even
if
we
meet
in
the
future
you
will
find
me
always
ready
to
do
you
a
service
very
good
begone
and
in
the
future
take
more
precautions
in
your
amorous
adventures
after
this
i
went
to
bed
well
pleased
with
what
i
had
seen
and
what
i
had
done
for
i
now
had
complete
power
over
the
corticelli
in
the
morning
i
called
on
her
as
soon
as
i
got
up
and
told
her
to
pack
up
her
things
forbidding
her
to
leave
her
room
till
she
got
into
the
carriage
i
shall
say
i
am
just
as
you
please
but
nobody
will
take
any
notice
of
you
i
did
not
wait
for
her
to
make
any
further
objections
but
proceeded
to
tell
the
tale
of
what
had
passed
to
madame
slightly
embroidering
the
narrative
she
laughed
heartily
and
enquired
of
the
oracle
what
must
be
done
with
the
lascaris
after
her
evident
pollution
by
the
evil
genius
disguised
as
a
priest
the
oracle
replied
that
we
must
set
out
the
next
day
for
besancon
whence
she
would
go
to
lyons
and
await
me
there
while
i
would
take
the
countess
to
geneva
and
thus
send
her
back
to
her
native
country
the
worthy
visionary
was
enchanted
with
this
arrangement
and
saw
in
it
another
proof
of
the
benevolence
of
selenis
who
would
thus
give
her
an
opportunity
of
seeing
young
aranda
once
more
it
was
agreed
that
i
was
to
rejoin
her
in
the
spring
of
the
following
year
to
perform
the
great
operation
which
was
to
make
her
be
born
a
man
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubts
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
this
performance
all
was
ready
and
the
next
day
we
started
madame
and
i
in
the
travelling
carriage
and
the
corticelli
her
mother
and
the
servants
in
another
conveyance
when
we
got
to
besancon
madame
left
me
and
on
the
next
day
i
journeyed
towards
geneva
with
the
mother
and
daughter
on
the
way
i
not
only
did
not
speak
to
my
companions
i
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
them
i
made
them
have
their
meals
with
a
servant
from
the
franche
comte
whom
i
had
taken
on
de
schaumburg
recommendation
i
went
to
my
banker
and
asked
him
to
get
me
a
good
coachman
who
would
take
two
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
to
turin
when
i
got
back
to
the
inn
i
wrote
to
the
chevalier
raiberti
sending
him
a
bill
of
exchange
i
warned
him
that
in
three
or
four
days
after
the
receipt
of
my
letter
he
would
be
accosted
by
a
bolognese
dancer
and
her
mother
bearing
a
letter
of
commendation
i
begged
him
to
see
that
they
lodged
in
a
respectable
house
and
to
pay
for
them
on
my
behalf
i
also
said
that
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
he
would
contrive
that
she
should
dance
even
for
nothing
at
the
carnival
and
i
begged
him
to
warn
her
that
if
i
heard
any
tales
about
her
when
i
came
to
turin
our
relations
would
be
at
an
end
the
following
day
a
clerk
of
tronchin
brought
a
coachman
for
me
to
see
the
man
said
he
was
ready
to
start
as
soon
as
he
had
had
his
dinner
i
confirmed
the
agreement
he
had
made
with
the
banker
i
summoned
the
two
corticellis
and
said
to
the
coachman
these
are
the
persons
you
are
to
drive
and
they
will
pay
you
when
they
reach
turin
in
safety
with
their
luggage
you
are
to
take
four
days
and
a
half
for
the
journey
as
is
stipulated
in
the
agreement
of
which
they
have
one
copy
and
you
another
an
hour
after
he
called
to
put
the
luggage
in
the
corticelli
burst
into
tears
but
i
was
not
so
cruel
as
to
send
her
away
without
any
consolation
her
bad
conduct
had
been
severely
enough
punished
already
i
made
her
dine
with
me
and
as
i
gave
her
the
letter
for
raiberti
and
louis
for
the
journey
i
told
her
what
i
had
written
to
the
gentleman
who
would
take
good
care
of
them
she
asked
me
for
a
trunk
containing
three
dresses
and
a
superb
mantle
which
madame
had
given
her
before
she
became
mad
but
i
said
that
we
would
talk
of
that
at
turin
she
dared
not
mention
the
casket
but
continued
weeping
however
she
did
not
move
me
to
pity
i
left
her
much
better
off
than
when
i
first
knew
her
she
had
good
clothes
good
linen
jewels
and
an
exceedingly
pretty
watch
i
had
given
her
altogether
a
good
deal
more
than
she
deserved
as
she
was
going
i
escorted
her
to
the
carriage
less
for
sake
than
to
commend
her
once
more
to
the
coachman
when
she
was
fairly
gone
i
felt
as
if
a
load
had
been
taken
off
my
back
and
i
went
to
look
up
my
worthy
syndic
whom
the
reader
will
not
have
forgotten
i
had
not
written
to
him
since
i
was
in
florence
and
i
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
surprise
which
was
extreme
but
after
gazing
at
me
for
a
moment
he
threw
his
arms
round
my
neck
kissed
me
several
times
and
said
he
had
not
expected
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
how
are
our
sweethearts
getting
on
excellently
they
are
always
talking
about
you
and
regretting
your
absence
they
will
go
wild
with
joy
when
they
know
you
are
here
you
must
tell
them
directly
then
i
will
go
and
warn
them
that
we
shall
all
sup
together
this
evening
by
the
way
de
voltaire
has
given
up
his
house
at
delices
to
de
villars
and
has
gone
to
live
at
ferney
that
makes
no
difference
to
me
as
i
was
not
thinking
of
calling
on
him
this
time
i
shall
be
here
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
i
mean
to
devote
my
time
to
you
you
are
too
good
will
you
give
me
writing
materials
before
you
go
out
i
will
write
a
few
letters
while
you
are
away
he
put
me
in
possession
of
his
desk
and
i
wrote
to
my
late
housekeeper
madame
lebel
telling
her
that
i
was
going
to
spend
three
weeks
at
geneva
and
that
if
i
were
sure
of
seeing
her
i
would
gladly
pay
a
visit
to
lausanne
unfortunately
i
also
wrote
to
the
bad
genoese
poet
ascanio
pogomas
or
giaccomo
passano
whom
i
had
met
at
leghorn
i
told
him
to
go
to
turin
and
to
wait
for
me
there
at
the
same
time
i
wrote
to
f
to
whom
i
had
commended
him
asking
him
to
give
the
poet
twelve
louis
for
the
journey
my
evil
genius
made
me
think
of
this
man
who
was
an
fellow
and
had
all
the
air
of
a
magician
to
introduce
him
to
madame
as
a
great
adept
you
will
see
dear
reader
in
the
course
of
a
year
whether
i
had
reason
to
repent
of
this
fatal
inspiration
as
the
syndic
and
i
were
on
our
way
to
our
young
friend
house
i
saw
an
elegant
english
carriage
for
sale
and
i
exchanged
it
for
mine
giving
the
owner
a
hundred
louis
as
well
while
the
bargain
was
going
on
the
uncle
of
the
young
theologian
who
argued
so
well
and
to
whom
i
had
given
such
pleasant
lessons
in
physiology
came
up
to
me
embraced
me
and
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
before
we
got
to
the
house
the
syndic
informed
me
that
we
should
find
another
extremely
pretty
but
uninitiated
girl
present
all
the
better
said
i
i
shall
know
how
to
regulate
my
conduct
and
perhaps
i
may
succeed
in
initiating
her
in
my
pocket
i
had
placed
a
casket
containing
a
dozen
exquisite
rings
i
had
long
been
aware
that
such
trifling
presents
are
often
very
serviceable
the
moment
of
meeting
those
charming
girls
once
more
was
one
of
the
happiest
i
have
ever
enjoyed
in
their
greeting
i
read
delight
and
love
of
pleasure
their
love
was
without
envy
or
jealousy
or
any
ideas
which
would
have
injured
their
they
felt
worthy
of
my
regard
as
they
had
lavished
their
favours
on
me
without
any
degrading
feelings
and
drawn
by
the
same
emotion
that
had
drawn
me
the
presence
of
the
neophyte
obliged
us
to
greet
each
other
with
what
is
called
decency
and
she
allowed
me
to
kiss
her
without
raising
her
eyes
but
blushing
violently
after
the
usual
commonplaces
had
passed
and
we
had
indulged
in
some
double
meanings
which
made
us
laugh
and
her
look
thoughtful
i
told
her
she
was
pretty
as
a
little
love
and
that
i
felt
sure
that
her
mind
as
beautiful
as
its
casket
could
harbour
no
prejudices
i
have
all
the
prejudices
which
honour
and
religion
suggest
she
modestly
replied
i
saw
that
this
was
a
case
requiring
very
delicate
treatment
there
was
no
question
of
carrying
the
citadel
by
sudden
assault
but
as
usual
i
fell
in
love
with
her
the
syndic
having
pronounced
my
name
she
said
ah
then
you
sir
are
the
person
who
discussed
some
very
singular
questions
with
my
cousin
the
pastor
niece
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
am
equally
pleased
to
make
yours
but
i
hope
the
pastor
niece
said
nothing
against
me
not
at
all
she
has
a
very
high
opinion
of
you
i
am
going
to
dine
with
her
and
i
shall
take
care
to
thank
her
i
should
like
to
be
there
for
i
enjoy
philosophical
discussions
though
i
never
dare
to
put
a
word
in
the
syndic
praised
her
discretion
and
wisdom
in
such
a
manner
that
i
was
convinced
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
that
he
had
either
seduced
her
or
was
trying
to
do
so
her
name
was
helen
i
asked
the
young
ladies
if
helen
was
their
sister
the
eldest
replied
with
a
sly
smile
that
she
was
a
sister
but
as
yet
she
had
no
brother
and
with
this
explanation
she
ran
up
to
helen
and
kissed
her
then
the
syndic
and
i
vied
with
each
other
in
paying
her
compliments
telling
her
that
we
hoped
to
be
her
brothers
she
blushed
but
gave
no
answer
to
our
gallantries
i
then
drew
forth
my
casket
and
seeing
that
all
the
girls
were
enchanted
with
the
rings
i
told
them
to
choose
which
ones
they
liked
best
the
charming
helen
imitated
their
example
and
repaid
me
with
a
modest
kiss
soon
after
she
left
us
and
we
were
once
more
free
as
in
old
times
the
syndic
had
good
cause
to
shew
for
his
love
of
helen
she
was
not
merely
pleasing
she
was
made
to
inspire
a
violent
passion
however
the
three
friends
had
no
hope
of
making
her
join
in
their
pleasures
for
they
said
that
she
had
invincible
feelings
of
modesty
where
men
were
concerned
we
supped
merrily
and
after
supper
we
began
our
sports
again
the
syndic
remaining
as
usual
a
mere
and
well
pleased
with
his
part
i
treated
each
of
the
three
nymphs
to
two
courses
deceiving
them
whenever
i
was
forced
by
nature
to
do
so
at
midnight
we
broke
up
and
the
worthy
syndic
escorted
me
to
the
door
of
my
lodging
the
day
following
i
went
to
the
pastor
and
found
a
numerous
party
assembled
amongst
others
and
de
ximenes
who
told
me
that
de
voltaire
knew
that
i
was
at
geneva
and
hoped
to
see
me
i
replied
by
a
profound
bow
mdlle
hedvig
the
pastor
niece
complimented
me
but
i
was
still
better
pleased
to
see
her
cousin
helen
the
theologian
of
was
fair
and
pleasant
to
the
eyes
but
she
had
not
that
ne
sais
quoi
that
shade
of
which
adds
zest
to
hope
as
well
as
pleasure
however
the
evident
friendship
between
hedvig
and
helen
gave
me
good
hopes
of
success
with
the
latter
we
had
an
excellent
dinner
and
while
it
lasted
the
conversation
was
restricted
to
ordinary
topics
but
at
dessert
the
pastor
begged
de
ximenes
to
ask
his
niece
some
questions
knowing
his
worldwide
reputation
i
expected
him
to
put
her
some
problem
in
geometry
but
he
only
asked
whether
a
lie
could
be
justified
on
the
principle
of
a
mental
reservation
hedvig
replied
that
there
are
cases
in
which
a
lie
is
necessary
but
that
the
principle
of
a
mental
reservation
is
always
a
cheat
then
how
could
christ
have
said
that
the
time
in
which
the
world
was
to
come
to
an
end
was
unknown
to
him
he
was
speaking
the
truth
it
was
not
known
to
him
then
he
was
not
god
that
is
a
false
deduction
for
since
god
may
do
all
things
he
may
certainly
be
ignorant
of
an
event
in
futurity
i
thought
the
way
in
which
she
brought
in
the
word
futurity
almost
sublime
hedvig
was
loudly
applauded
and
her
uncle
went
all
round
the
table
to
kiss
her
i
had
a
very
natural
objection
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
which
she
might
have
found
difficult
to
answer
but
i
wanted
to
get
into
her
good
graces
and
i
kept
my
own
counsel
was
urged
to
ask
her
some
questions
but
he
replied
in
the
words
of
horace
mihi
religio
est
then
hedvig
turned
to
me
and
asked
me
to
put
her
some
hard
question
something
difficult
which
you
do
know
yourself
i
shall
be
delighted
do
you
grant
that
a
god
possesses
in
a
supreme
degree
the
qualities
of
man
yes
excepting
man
weaknesses
do
you
class
the
generative
power
as
a
weakness
no
will
you
tell
me
then
of
what
nature
would
have
been
the
offspring
of
a
union
between
a
god
and
a
mortal
woman
hedvig
looked
as
red
as
fire
the
pastor
and
the
other
guests
looked
at
each
other
while
i
gazed
fixedly
at
the
young
theologian
who
was
reflecting
said
that
we
should
have
to
send
for
voltaire
to
settle
a
question
so
difficult
but
as
hedvig
had
collected
her
thoughts
and
seemed
ready
to
speak
everybody
was
silent
it
would
be
absurd
said
she
to
suppose
that
a
deity
could
perform
such
an
action
without
its
having
any
results
at
the
end
of
nine
months
a
woman
would
be
delivered
a
male
child
which
would
be
three
parts
man
and
one
part
god
at
these
words
all
the
guests
applauded
de
ximenes
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
way
the
question
had
been
solved
adding
naturally
if
the
son
of
the
woman
married
his
children
would
be
men
and
gods
yes
said
i
unless
he
married
a
goddess
which
would
have
made
the
proportion
different
tell
me
exactly
said
hedvig
what
proportion
of
divinity
there
would
be
in
a
child
of
the
sixteenth
generation
give
me
a
pencil
and
i
will
soon
tell
you
said
de
ximenes
there
is
no
need
to
calculate
it
said
i
the
child
would
have
some
small
share
of
the
wit
which
you
enjoy
everybody
applauded
this
gallant
speech
which
did
not
by
any
means
offend
the
lady
to
whom
it
was
addressed
this
pretty
blonde
was
chiefly
desirable
for
the
charms
of
her
intellect
we
rose
from
the
table
and
made
a
circle
round
her
but
she
told
us
with
much
grace
not
to
pay
her
any
more
compliments
i
took
helen
aside
and
told
her
to
get
her
cousin
to
choose
a
ring
from
my
casket
which
i
gave
her
and
she
seemed
glad
to
execute
the
commission
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
hedvig
came
to
shew
me
her
hand
adorned
with
the
ring
she
had
chosen
i
kissed
it
rapturously
and
she
must
have
guessed
from
the
warmth
of
my
kisses
with
what
feelings
she
had
inspired
me
in
the
evening
helen
told
the
syndic
and
the
three
girls
all
about
the
morning
discussion
without
leaving
out
the
smallest
detail
she
told
the
story
with
ease
and
grace
and
i
had
no
occasion
to
prompt
her
we
begged
her
to
stay
to
supper
but
she
whispered
something
to
the
three
friends
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
impossible
but
she
said
that
she
might
spend
a
couple
of
days
with
them
in
their
country
house
on
the
lake
if
they
would
ask
her
mother
at
the
syndic
request
the
girls
called
on
the
mother
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
they
went
off
with
helen
the
same
evening
we
went
and
supped
with
them
but
we
could
not
sleep
there
the
syndic
was
to
take
me
to
a
house
at
a
short
distance
off
where
we
should
be
very
comfortable
this
being
the
case
there
was
no
hurry
and
the
eldest
girl
said
that
the
syndic
and
i
could
leave
whenever
we
liked
but
that
they
were
going
to
bed
so
saying
she
took
helen
to
her
room
while
the
two
others
slept
in
another
room
soon
after
the
syndic
went
into
the
room
where
helen
was
and
i
visited
the
two
others
i
had
scarcely
been
with
my
two
sweethearts
for
an
hour
when
the
syndic
interrupted
my
erotic
exploits
by
begging
me
to
go
what
have
you
done
with
helen
i
asked
nothing
she
a
simpleton
and
an
intractable
one
she
hid
under
the
sheets
and
would
not
look
at
my
performance
with
her
friend
you
ought
to
go
to
her
direct
i
have
done
so
but
she
repulsed
me
again
and
again
i
have
given
it
up
and
shall
not
try
it
again
unless
you
will
tame
her
for
me
how
is
it
to
be
done
come
to
dinner
i
shall
be
away
at
geneva
i
shall
be
back
by
i
wish
we
could
give
her
too
much
to
drink
that
would
be
a
pity
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
i
accordingly
went
to
dine
with
them
by
myself
the
next
day
and
they
entertained
me
in
all
the
force
of
the
word
after
dinner
we
went
for
a
walk
and
the
three
friends
understanding
my
aims
left
me
alone
with
the
intractable
girl
who
resisted
my
caresses
in
a
manner
which
almost
made
me
give
up
the
hope
of
taming
her
the
syndic
said
i
is
in
love
with
you
and
last
night
last
night
she
said
he
amused
himself
with
his
old
friend
i
am
for
everyone
following
their
own
tastes
but
i
expect
to
be
allowed
to
follow
mine
if
i
could
gain
your
heart
i
should
be
happy
why
do
you
invite
the
pastor
and
my
cousin
to
dine
with
you
i
could
come
too
for
the
pastor
makes
much
of
everyone
who
loves
his
niece
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
has
she
a
lover
no
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
she
is
young
pretty
agreeable
and
very
clever
you
do
understand
genevan
ways
it
is
because
she
is
so
clever
that
no
young
man
falls
in
love
with
her
those
who
might
be
attracted
by
her
personal
charms
hold
themselves
aloof
on
account
of
her
intellectual
capacities
as
they
would
have
to
sit
in
silence
before
her
are
the
young
genevans
so
ignorant
then
as
a
rule
they
are
some
of
them
have
received
excellent
educations
but
in
a
general
way
they
are
full
of
prejudice
nobody
wishes
to
be
considered
a
fool
or
a
blockhead
but
clever
women
are
not
appreciated
and
if
a
girl
is
witty
or
well
educated
she
endeavors
to
hide
her
lights
at
least
if
she
desires
to
be
married
ah
now
i
see
why
you
did
not
open
your
lips
during
our
discussion
no
i
know
i
have
nothing
to
hide
this
was
not
the
motive
which
made
me
keep
silence
but
the
pleasure
of
listening
i
admired
my
cousin
who
was
not
afraid
to
display
her
learning
on
a
subject
which
any
other
girl
would
have
affected
to
know
nothing
about
yes
affected
though
she
might
very
probably
know
as
much
as
her
grandmother
that
a
matter
of
morals
or
rather
of
prejudices
your
reasoning
is
admirable
and
i
am
already
longing
for
the
party
you
so
cleverly
suggested
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
being
with
my
cousin
i
do
her
justice
hedvig
is
certainly
a
very
interesting
and
agreeable
girl
but
believe
me
it
is
your
presence
that
will
constitute
my
chief
enjoyment
and
how
if
i
do
not
believe
you
you
would
wrong
me
and
give
me
pain
for
i
love
you
dearly
in
spite
of
that
you
have
deceived
me
i
am
sure
that
you
have
given
marks
of
your
affection
to
those
three
young
ladies
for
my
part
i
pity
them
why
because
neither
of
them
can
flatter
herself
that
you
love
her
and
her
alone
and
do
you
think
that
your
delicacy
of
feeling
makes
you
happier
than
they
are
yes
i
think
so
though
of
course
i
have
no
experience
in
the
matter
tell
me
truly
do
you
think
i
am
right
yes
i
do
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
but
you
must
confess
that
to
associate
me
with
them
in
your
attentions
would
not
be
giving
me
the
greatest
possible
proof
of
your
love
yes
i
do
confess
it
and
i
beg
your
pardon
but
tell
me
how
i
should
set
to
work
to
ask
the
pastor
to
dinner
there
will
be
no
difficulty
just
call
on
him
and
ask
him
to
come
and
if
you
wish
me
to
be
of
the
party
beg
him
to
ask
my
mother
and
myself
why
your
mother
because
he
has
been
in
love
with
her
these
twenty
years
and
loves
her
still
and
where
shall
i
give
this
dinner
is
not
tronchin
your
banker
yes
he
has
a
nice
pleasure
house
on
the
lake
ask
him
to
lend
it
you
for
the
day
he
will
be
delighted
to
do
so
but
do
tell
the
syndic
or
his
three
friends
anything
about
it
they
can
hear
of
it
afterwards
but
do
you
think
your
learned
cousin
will
be
glad
to
be
in
my
company
more
than
glad
you
may
be
sure
very
good
everything
will
be
arranged
by
tomorrow
the
day
after
you
will
be
returning
to
geneva
and
the
party
will
take
place
two
or
three
days
later
the
syndic
came
back
in
due
course
and
we
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
after
supper
the
ladies
went
to
bed
as
before
and
i
went
with
the
eldest
girl
while
the
syndic
visited
the
two
younger
ones
i
knew
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
try
to
do
anything
with
helen
so
i
contented
myself
with
a
few
kisses
after
which
i
wished
them
good
night
and
passed
on
to
the
next
room
i
found
them
in
a
deep
sleep
and
the
syndic
seemed
visibly
bored
he
did
not
look
more
cheerful
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
had
no
success
with
helen
i
see
said
he
that
i
shall
waste
my
time
with
the
little
fool
i
think
i
shall
give
her
up
i
think
that
the
best
thing
you
could
do
i
replied
for
a
man
who
languishes
after
a
woman
who
is
either
devoid
of
feeling
or
full
of
caprice
makes
himself
her
dupe
bliss
should
be
neither
too
easy
nor
too
hard
to
be
won
the
next
day
we
returned
to
geneva
and
tronchin
seemed
delighted
to
oblige
me
the
pastor
accepted
my
invitation
and
said
i
was
sure
to
be
charmed
with
helen
mother
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
worthy
man
cherished
a
tenderness
for
her
and
if
she
responded
at
all
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
my
purposes
i
was
thinking
of
supping
with
the
charming
helen
and
her
three
friends
at
the
house
on
the
lake
but
an
express
summoned
me
to
lausanne
madame
lebel
my
old
housekeeper
invited
me
to
sup
with
her
and
her
husband
she
wrote
that
she
had
made
her
husband
promise
to
take
her
to
lausanne
as
soon
as
she
got
my
letter
and
she
added
she
was
sure
that
i
would
resign
everything
to
give
her
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
she
notified
the
hour
at
which
she
would
be
at
her
mother
house
madame
lebel
was
one
of
the
ten
or
twelve
women
for
whom
in
my
happy
youth
i
cherished
the
greatest
affection
she
had
all
the
qualities
to
make
a
man
a
good
wife
if
it
had
been
my
fate
to
experience
such
felicity
but
perhaps
i
did
well
not
to
tie
myself
down
with
irrevocable
bonds
though
now
my
independence
is
another
name
for
slavery
but
if
i
had
married
a
woman
of
tact
who
would
have
ruled
me
unawares
to
myself
i
should
have
taken
care
of
my
fortune
and
have
had
children
instead
of
being
lonely
and
penniless
in
my
old
age
but
i
must
indulge
no
longer
in
digressions
on
the
past
which
can
not
be
recalled
and
since
my
recollections
make
me
happy
i
should
be
foolish
to
cherish
idle
regrets
i
calculated
that
if
i
started
directly
i
should
get
to
lausanne
an
hour
before
madame
lebel
and
i
did
not
hesitate
to
give
her
this
proof
of
my
regard
i
must
here
warn
my
readers
that
though
i
loved
this
woman
well
i
was
then
occupied
with
another
passion
and
no
voluptuous
thought
mingled
with
my
desire
of
seeing
her
my
esteem
for
her
was
enough
to
hold
my
passions
in
check
but
i
esteemed
lebel
too
and
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
disturb
the
happiness
of
this
married
pair
i
wrote
in
haste
to
the
syndic
telling
him
that
an
important
and
sudden
call
obliged
me
to
start
for
lausanne
but
that
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
supping
with
him
and
his
three
friends
at
geneva
on
the
following
day
i
knocked
at
madame
dubois
door
at
five
almost
dying
with
hunger
her
surprise
was
extreme
for
she
did
not
know
that
her
daughter
was
going
to
meet
me
at
her
house
without
more
ado
i
gave
her
two
louis
to
get
us
a
good
supper
at
seven
madame
lebel
her
husband
and
a
child
of
eighteen
months
whom
i
easily
recognized
as
my
own
arrived
our
meeting
was
a
happy
one
indeed
we
spent
ten
hours
at
table
and
mirth
and
joy
prevailed
at
she
started
for
soleure
where
lebel
had
business
de
chavigni
had
desired
to
be
remembered
most
affectionately
to
me
lebel
assured
me
that
the
ambassador
was
extremely
kind
to
his
wife
and
he
thanked
me
heartily
for
having
given
such
a
woman
up
to
him
i
could
easily
see
that
he
was
a
happy
husband
and
that
his
wife
was
as
happy
as
he
my
dear
housekeeper
talked
to
me
about
my
son
she
said
that
nobody
suspected
the
truth
but
that
neither
she
nor
lebel
who
had
faithfully
kept
his
promise
and
had
not
consummated
the
marriage
for
the
two
months
agreed
upon
had
any
doubts
the
secret
said
lebel
to
me
will
never
be
known
and
your
son
will
be
my
sole
heir
or
will
share
my
property
with
my
children
if
i
ever
have
any
which
i
doubt
my
dear
said
his
wife
there
is
somebody
who
has
very
strong
suspicions
on
the
subject
and
these
suspicions
will
gain
strength
as
the
child
grows
older
but
we
have
nothing
to
fear
on
that
score
as
she
is
well
paid
to
keep
the
secret
and
who
is
this
person
said
i
madame
she
has
not
forgotten
the
past
and
often
speaks
of
you
will
you
kindly
remember
me
to
her
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
so
and
i
am
sure
the
message
will
give
her
great
pleasure
lebel
shewed
me
my
ring
and
i
shewed
him
his
and
gave
him
a
superb
watch
for
my
son
you
must
give
it
him
i
said
when
you
think
he
is
old
enough
we
shall
hear
of
the
young
gentleman
in
years
at
fontainebleau
i
passed
three
hours
in
telling
them
of
all
the
adventures
i
had
during
the
months
since
we
had
seen
one
another
as
to
their
history
it
was
soon
told
it
had
all
the
calm
which
belongs
to
happiness
madame
lebel
was
as
pretty
as
ever
and
i
could
see
no
change
in
her
but
i
was
no
longer
the
same
man
she
thought
me
less
lively
than
of
old
and
she
was
right
the
renaud
had
blasted
me
and
the
pretended
lascaris
had
given
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
anxiety
we
embraced
each
other
tenderly
and
the
wedded
pair
returned
to
soleure
and
i
to
geneva
but
feeling
that
i
wanted
rest
i
wrote
to
the
syndic
that
i
was
not
well
and
could
not
come
till
the
next
day
and
after
i
had
done
so
i
went
to
bed
the
next
day
the
eve
of
my
dinner
party
i
ordered
a
repast
in
which
no
expense
was
to
be
spared
i
did
not
forget
to
tell
the
landlord
to
get
me
the
best
wines
the
choicest
liqueurs
ices
and
all
the
materials
for
a
bowl
of
punch
i
told
him
that
we
should
be
six
in
number
for
i
foresaw
that
tronchin
would
dine
with
us
i
was
right
i
found
him
at
his
pretty
house
ready
to
receive
us
and
i
had
not
much
trouble
in
inducing
him
to
stay
in
the
evening
i
thought
it
as
well
to
tell
the
syndic
and
his
three
friends
about
it
in
helen
presence
while
she
feigning
ignorance
said
that
her
mother
had
told
her
they
were
going
somewhere
or
other
to
dinner
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
said
i
it
must
be
at
m
tronchin
my
dinner
would
have
satisfied
the
most
exacting
gourmet
but
hedvig
was
its
real
charm
she
treated
difficult
theological
questions
with
so
much
grace
and
rationalised
so
skilfully
that
though
one
might
not
be
convinced
it
was
impossible
to
help
being
attracted
i
have
never
seen
any
theologian
who
could
treat
the
most
difficult
points
with
so
much
facility
eloquence
and
real
dignity
and
at
dinner
she
completed
her
conquest
of
myself
tronchin
who
had
never
heard
her
speak
before
thanked
me
a
hundred
times
for
having
procured
him
this
pleasure
and
being
obliged
to
leave
us
by
the
call
of
business
he
asked
us
to
meet
again
in
two
days
time
i
was
much
interested
during
the
dessert
by
the
evident
tenderness
of
the
pastor
for
helen
mother
his
amorous
eloquence
grew
in
strength
as
he
irrigated
his
throat
with
champagne
greek
wine
and
eastern
liqueurs
the
lady
seemed
pleased
and
was
a
match
for
him
as
far
as
drinking
was
concerned
while
the
two
girls
and
myself
only
drank
with
sobriety
however
the
mixture
of
wines
and
above
all
the
punch
had
done
their
work
and
my
charmers
were
slightly
elevated
their
spirits
were
delightful
but
rather
pronounced
i
took
this
favourable
opportunity
to
ask
the
two
aged
lovers
if
i
might
take
the
young
ladies
for
a
walk
in
the
garden
by
the
lake
and
they
told
us
enthusiastically
to
go
and
enjoy
ourselves
we
went
out
arm
in
arm
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
out
of
sight
of
everyone
do
you
know
said
i
to
hedvig
that
you
have
made
a
conquest
of
m
tronchin
have
i
the
worthy
banker
asked
me
some
very
silly
questions
you
must
not
expect
everyone
to
be
able
to
contend
with
you
i
ca
help
telling
you
that
your
question
pleased
me
best
of
all
a
bigoted
theologian
at
the
end
of
the
table
seemed
scandalized
at
the
question
and
still
more
at
the
answer
and
why
he
says
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
a
deity
could
not
impregnate
a
woman
he
said
that
he
would
explain
the
reason
to
me
if
i
were
a
man
but
being
a
woman
and
a
maid
he
could
not
with
propriety
expound
such
mysteries
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
the
fool
meant
i
should
be
very
glad
but
you
must
allow
me
to
speak
plainly
and
i
shall
have
to
take
for
granted
that
you
are
acquainted
with
the
physical
conformation
of
a
man
yes
speak
as
plainly
as
you
like
for
there
is
nobody
to
hear
what
we
say
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
only
acquainted
with
the
peculiarities
of
the
male
by
theory
and
reading
i
have
no
practical
knowledge
i
have
seen
statues
but
i
have
never
seen
or
examined
a
real
live
man
have
you
helen
i
have
never
wished
to
do
so
why
not
it
is
good
to
know
everything
well
hedvig
your
theologian
meant
to
say
that
a
god
was
not
capable
of
this
what
is
that
give
me
your
hand
i
can
feel
it
and
have
thought
it
would
be
something
like
that
without
this
provision
of
nature
man
would
not
be
able
to
fecundate
his
mate
and
how
could
the
foolish
theologian
maintain
that
this
was
an
imperfection
because
it
is
the
result
of
desire
hedvig
and
it
would
not
have
taken
place
in
me
if
i
had
not
been
charmed
with
you
and
if
i
had
not
conceived
the
most
seducing
ideas
of
the
beauties
that
i
can
not
see
from
the
view
of
the
beauties
i
can
see
tell
me
frankly
whether
feeling
that
did
not
give
you
an
agreeable
sensation
it
did
and
just
in
the
place
where
your
hand
is
now
do
you
feel
a
pleasant
tickling
there
helen
after
what
the
gentleman
has
been
saying
to
us
yes
i
feel
it
but
i
often
do
without
anything
to
excite
me
and
then
said
i
nature
makes
you
appease
it
thus
not
at
all
oh
yes
said
hedvig
even
when
we
are
asleep
our
hands
seek
that
spot
as
if
by
instinct
and
if
it
were
not
for
that
solace
i
think
we
should
get
terribly
as
this
philosophical
discourse
conducted
by
the
young
theologian
in
quite
a
professional
manner
proceeded
we
reached
a
beautiful
basin
of
water
with
a
flight
of
marble
steps
for
bathers
although
the
air
was
cool
our
heads
were
hot
and
i
conceived
the
idea
of
telling
them
that
it
would
do
them
good
to
bathe
their
feet
and
that
if
they
would
allow
me
i
would
take
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
i
should
like
to
so
much
said
hedvig
and
i
too
said
helen
then
sit
down
ladies
on
the
first
step
they
proceeded
to
sit
down
and
i
began
to
take
off
their
shoes
praising
the
beauty
of
their
legs
and
pretending
for
the
present
not
to
want
to
go
farther
than
the
knee
when
they
got
into
the
water
they
were
obliged
to
pick
up
their
clothes
and
i
encouraged
them
to
do
so
well
well
said
hedvig
men
have
thighs
too
helen
who
would
have
been
ashamed
to
be
beaten
by
her
cousin
was
not
backward
in
shewing
her
legs
that
will
do
charming
maids
said
i
you
might
catch
cold
if
you
stayed
longer
in
the
water
they
walked
up
backwards
still
holding
up
their
clothes
for
fear
of
wetting
them
and
it
was
then
my
duty
to
wipe
them
dry
with
all
the
handkerchiefs
i
had
this
pleasant
task
left
me
at
freedom
to
touch
and
see
and
the
reader
will
imagine
that
i
did
my
best
in
that
direction
the
fair
theologian
told
me
i
wanted
to
know
too
much
but
helen
let
me
do
what
i
liked
with
such
a
tender
and
affectionate
expression
that
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
within
bounds
at
last
when
i
had
drawn
on
their
shoes
and
stockings
i
told
them
that
i
was
delighted
to
have
seen
the
hidden
charms
of
the
two
prettiest
girls
in
geneva
what
effect
had
it
on
you
asked
hedvig
i
dare
tell
you
to
look
but
feel
both
of
you
do
you
bathe
too
it
out
of
the
question
a
man
undressing
takes
so
much
trouble
but
we
have
still
two
hours
before
us
in
which
we
need
not
fear
any
interruption
this
reply
gave
me
a
foretaste
of
the
bliss
i
had
to
gain
but
i
did
not
wish
to
expose
myself
to
an
illness
by
going
into
the
water
in
my
present
state
i
noticed
a
at
a
little
distance
and
feeling
sure
that
tronchin
had
left
the
door
open
i
took
the
two
girls
on
my
arm
and
led
them
there
without
giving
them
any
hint
of
my
intentions
the
was
scented
with
vases
of
and
adorned
with
engravings
but
best
of
all
there
was
a
large
couch
which
seemed
made
for
repose
and
pleasure
i
sat
down
on
it
between
my
two
sweethearts
and
as
i
caressed
them
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
shew
them
something
they
had
never
seen
before
and
without
more
ado
i
displayed
to
their
gaze
the
principal
agent
in
the
preservation
of
the
human
race
they
got
up
to
admire
it
and
taking
a
hand
of
each
one
i
procured
them
some
enjoyment
but
in
the
middle
of
their
labours
an
abundant
flow
of
liquid
threw
them
into
the
greatest
astonishment
that
said
i
is
the
word
which
makes
men
it
beautiful
cried
helen
laughing
at
the
term
word
i
have
a
word
too
said
hedvig
and
i
will
shew
it
to
you
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
come
hedvig
and
i
will
save
you
the
trouble
of
making
it
yourself
and
will
do
it
better
i
daresay
but
i
have
never
done
it
with
a
man
no
more
have
i
said
helen
placing
them
in
front
of
me
i
gave
them
another
ecstacy
we
then
sat
down
and
while
i
felt
all
their
charms
i
let
them
touch
me
as
much
as
they
liked
till
i
watered
their
hands
a
second
time
we
made
ourselves
decent
once
more
and
spent
half
an
hour
in
kisses
and
caresses
and
i
then
told
them
that
they
had
made
me
happy
only
in
part
but
that
i
hoped
they
would
make
my
bliss
complete
by
presenting
me
with
their
maidenheads
i
shewed
them
the
little
invented
by
the
english
in
the
interests
of
the
fair
sex
they
admired
them
greatly
when
i
explained
their
use
and
the
fair
theologian
remarked
to
her
cousin
that
she
would
think
it
over
we
were
now
close
friends
and
soon
promised
to
be
something
more
and
we
walked
back
and
found
the
pastor
and
helen
mother
strolling
by
the
side
of
the
lake
when
i
got
back
to
geneva
i
went
to
spend
the
evening
with
the
three
friends
but
i
took
good
care
not
to
tell
the
syndic
anything
about
my
victory
with
helen
it
would
only
have
served
to
renew
his
hopes
and
he
would
have
had
this
trouble
for
nothing
even
i
would
have
done
no
good
without
the
young
theologian
but
as
helen
admired
her
she
did
not
like
to
appear
her
inferior
by
refusing
to
imitate
her
freedom
i
did
not
see
helen
that
evening
but
i
saw
her
the
next
day
at
her
mother
house
for
i
was
in
mere
politeness
bound
to
thank
the
old
lady
for
the
honour
she
had
done
me
she
gave
me
a
most
friendly
reception
and
introduced
me
to
two
very
pretty
girls
who
were
boarding
with
her
they
might
have
interested
me
if
i
had
been
stopping
long
in
geneva
but
as
if
was
helen
claimed
all
my
attraction
said
the
charming
girl
i
shall
be
able
to
get
a
word
with
you
at
madame
tronchin
dinner
and
i
expect
hedvig
will
have
hit
on
some
way
for
you
to
satisfy
your
desires
the
banker
gave
us
an
excellent
dinner
he
proudly
told
me
that
no
could
give
such
a
good
dinner
as
a
rich
gentleman
who
has
a
good
cook
a
good
cellar
good
silver
plate
and
china
of
the
best
quality
we
were
twenty
of
us
at
table
and
the
feast
was
given
chiefly
in
honour
of
the
learned
theologian
and
myself
as
a
rich
foreigner
who
spent
money
freely
de
ximenes
who
had
just
arrived
from
ferney
was
there
and
told
me
that
de
voltaire
was
expecting
me
but
i
had
foolishly
determined
not
to
go
hedvig
shone
in
solving
the
questions
put
to
her
by
the
company
de
ximenes
begged
her
to
justify
as
best
she
could
our
first
mother
who
had
deceived
her
husband
by
giving
him
the
fatal
apple
to
eat
eve
she
said
did
not
deceive
her
husband
she
only
cajoled
him
into
eating
it
in
the
hope
of
giving
him
one
more
perfection
besides
eve
had
not
been
forbidden
to
eat
the
fruit
by
god
but
only
by
adam
and
in
all
probability
her
woman
sense
prevented
her
regarding
the
prohibition
as
serious
at
this
reply
which
i
found
full
of
sense
and
wit
two
scholars
from
geneva
and
even
hedvig
uncle
began
to
murmur
and
shake
their
heads
madame
tronchin
said
gravely
that
eve
had
received
the
prohibition
from
god
himself
but
the
girl
only
answered
by
a
humble
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
at
this
she
turned
to
the
pastor
with
a
frightened
manner
and
said
what
do
you
say
to
this
madam
my
niece
is
not
infallible
excuse
me
dear
uncle
i
am
as
infallible
as
holy
writ
when
i
speak
according
to
it
bring
a
bible
and
let
me
see
hedvig
my
dear
hedvig
you
are
right
after
all
here
it
is
the
prohibition
was
given
before
woman
was
made
everybody
applauded
but
hedvig
remained
quite
calm
it
was
only
the
two
scholars
and
madame
tronchin
who
still
seemed
disturbed
another
lady
then
asked
her
if
it
was
allowable
to
believe
the
history
of
the
apple
to
be
symbolical
she
replied
i
do
not
think
so
because
it
could
only
be
a
symbol
of
sexual
union
and
it
is
clear
that
such
did
not
take
place
between
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
the
learned
differ
on
this
point
all
the
worse
for
them
madam
the
scripture
is
plain
enough
in
the
first
verse
of
the
fourth
chapter
it
is
written
that
adam
knew
his
wife
after
they
had
been
driven
from
the
garden
and
that
in
consequence
she
conceived
cain
yes
but
the
verse
does
not
say
that
adam
did
not
know
her
before
and
consequently
he
might
have
done
so
i
can
not
admit
the
inference
as
in
that
case
she
would
have
conceived
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
two
creatures
who
had
just
left
god
hands
and
were
consequently
as
nearly
perfect
as
is
possible
could
perform
the
act
of
generation
without
its
having
any
result
this
reply
gained
everyone
applause
and
compliments
to
hedvig
made
the
round
of
the
table
tronchin
asked
her
if
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
could
be
gathered
from
the
old
testament
alone
the
old
testament
she
replied
does
not
teach
this
doctrine
but
nevertheless
human
reason
teaches
it
as
the
soul
is
a
substance
and
the
destruction
of
any
substance
is
an
unthinkable
proposition
then
i
will
ask
you
said
the
banker
if
the
existence
of
the
soul
is
established
in
the
bible
where
there
is
smoke
there
is
always
fire
tell
me
then
if
matter
can
think
i
can
not
answer
that
question
for
it
is
beyond
my
knowledge
i
can
only
say
that
as
i
believe
god
to
be
all
powerful
i
can
not
deny
him
the
power
to
make
matter
capable
of
thought
but
what
is
your
own
opinion
i
believe
that
i
have
a
soul
endowed
with
thinking
capacities
but
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
remember
that
i
had
the
honour
of
dining
with
you
after
i
die
then
you
think
that
the
soul
and
the
memory
may
be
separable
but
in
that
case
you
would
not
be
a
theologian
one
may
be
a
theologian
and
a
philosopher
for
philosophy
never
contradicts
any
truth
and
besides
to
say
do
not
know
is
not
the
same
as
am
sure
three
parts
of
the
guests
burst
into
cries
of
admiration
and
the
fair
philosopher
enjoyed
seeing
me
laugh
for
pleasure
at
the
applause
the
pastor
wept
for
joy
and
whispered
something
to
helen
mother
all
at
once
he
turned
to
me
saying
ask
my
niece
some
question
yes
said
hedvig
but
it
must
be
something
quite
new
that
is
a
hard
task
i
replied
for
how
am
i
to
know
that
what
i
ask
is
new
to
you
however
tell
me
if
one
must
stop
at
the
first
principle
of
a
thing
one
wants
to
understand
certainly
and
the
reason
is
that
in
god
there
is
no
first
principle
and
he
is
therefore
incomprehensible
god
be
praised
that
is
how
i
would
have
you
answer
can
god
have
any
there
my
learning
is
baffled
i
know
not
what
to
reply
you
should
not
ask
me
so
hard
a
thing
as
that
but
you
wished
for
something
new
i
thought
the
newest
thing
would
be
to
see
you
at
a
loss
that
prettily
said
be
kind
enough
to
reply
for
me
gentlemen
and
teach
me
what
to
say
everybody
tried
to
answer
but
nothing
was
said
worthy
of
record
hedvig
at
last
said
my
opinion
is
that
since
god
knows
all
he
knows
of
his
own
existence
but
you
must
not
ask
me
how
he
knows
it
that
well
said
i
answered
and
nobody
could
throw
any
further
light
on
the
matter
all
the
company
looked
on
me
as
a
polite
atheist
so
superficial
is
the
judgment
of
society
but
it
did
not
matter
to
me
whether
they
thought
me
an
atheist
or
not
de
ximenes
asked
hedvig
if
matter
had
been
created
i
can
not
recognize
the
word
she
replied
ask
me
whether
matter
was
formed
and
i
shall
reply
in
the
affirmative
the
word
can
not
have
existence
for
the
existence
of
anything
must
be
prior
to
the
word
which
explains
it
then
what
meaning
do
you
assign
to
the
word
made
out
of
nothing
you
see
the
absurdity
for
nothing
must
have
first
existed
i
am
glad
to
see
you
laugh
do
you
think
that
nothingness
could
be
created
you
are
right
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
one
of
the
guests
superciliously
kindly
tell
me
who
was
your
teacher
said
de
ximenes
my
uncle
there
not
at
all
my
dear
niece
i
certainly
never
taught
you
what
you
have
been
telling
us
but
my
niece
gentlemen
reads
and
reflects
over
what
she
has
read
perhaps
with
rather
too
much
freedom
but
i
love
her
all
the
same
because
she
always
ends
by
acknowledging
that
she
knows
nothing
a
lady
who
had
not
opened
her
lips
hitherto
asked
hedvig
for
a
definition
of
spirit
your
question
is
a
purely
philosophical
one
and
i
must
answer
that
i
do
not
know
enough
of
spirit
or
matter
to
be
able
to
give
a
satisfactory
definition
but
since
you
acknowledge
the
existence
of
deity
and
must
therefore
have
an
abstract
idea
of
spirit
you
must
have
some
notions
on
the
subject
and
should
be
able
to
tell
me
how
it
acts
on
matter
no
solid
foundation
can
be
built
on
abstract
ideas
hobbes
calls
such
ideas
mere
fantasms
one
may
have
them
but
if
one
begins
to
reason
on
them
one
is
landed
in
contradiction
i
know
that
god
sees
me
but
i
should
labour
in
vain
if
i
endeavoured
to
prove
it
by
reasoning
for
reason
tells
us
no
one
can
see
anything
without
organs
of
sight
and
god
being
a
pure
spirit
and
therefore
without
organs
it
is
scientifically
impossible
that
he
can
see
us
any
more
than
we
can
see
him
but
moses
and
several
others
have
seen
him
and
i
believe
it
so
without
attempting
to
reason
on
it
you
are
quite
right
said
i
for
you
would
be
confronted
by
blank
impossibility
but
if
you
take
to
reading
hobbes
you
are
in
danger
of
becoming
an
atheist
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
i
can
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
atheism
after
dinner
everybody
crowded
round
this
truly
astonishing
girl
so
that
i
had
no
opportunity
of
whispering
my
love
however
i
went
apart
with
helen
who
told
me
that
the
pastor
and
his
niece
were
going
to
sup
with
her
mother
the
following
day
hedvig
she
added
will
stay
the
night
and
sleep
with
me
as
she
always
does
when
she
comes
to
supper
with
her
uncle
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
you
are
willing
to
hide
in
a
place
i
will
shew
you
at
eleven
tomorrow
in
order
to
sleep
with
us
call
on
my
mother
at
that
hour
and
i
will
find
an
opportunity
of
shewing
you
where
it
is
you
will
be
safe
though
not
comfortable
and
if
you
grow
weary
you
can
console
yourself
by
thinking
that
you
are
in
our
minds
shall
i
have
to
stay
there
long
four
hours
at
the
most
at
seven
the
street
door
is
shut
and
only
opened
to
anyone
who
rings
if
i
happen
to
cough
while
i
am
in
hiding
might
i
be
heard
yes
that
might
happen
there
a
great
hazard
all
the
rest
is
of
no
consequence
but
no
matter
i
will
risk
all
for
the
sake
of
so
great
happiness
in
the
morning
i
paid
the
mother
a
visit
and
as
helen
was
escorting
me
out
she
shewed
me
a
door
between
the
two
stairs
at
seven
said
she
the
door
will
be
open
and
when
you
are
in
put
on
the
bolt
take
care
that
no
one
sees
you
as
you
are
entering
the
house
at
a
quarter
to
seven
i
was
already
a
prisoner
i
found
a
seat
in
my
cell
otherwise
i
should
neither
have
been
able
to
lie
down
or
to
stand
up
it
was
a
regular
hole
and
i
knew
by
my
sense
of
smell
that
hams
and
cheeses
were
usually
kept
there
but
it
contained
none
at
present
for
i
fell
all
round
to
see
how
the
land
lay
as
i
was
cautiously
stepping
round
i
felt
my
foot
encounter
some
resistance
and
putting
down
my
hand
i
recognized
the
feel
of
linen
it
was
a
napkin
containing
two
plates
a
nice
roast
fowl
bread
and
a
second
napkin
searching
again
i
came
across
a
bottle
and
a
glass
i
was
grateful
to
my
charmers
for
having
thought
of
my
stomach
but
as
i
had
purposely
made
a
late
and
heavy
meal
i
determined
to
defer
the
consumption
of
my
cold
collation
till
a
later
hour
at
nine
i
began
and
as
i
had
neither
a
knife
nor
a
corkscrew
i
was
obliged
to
break
the
neck
of
the
bottle
with
a
brick
which
i
was
fortunately
able
to
detach
from
the
mouldering
floor
the
wine
was
delicious
old
neuchatel
and
the
fowl
was
stuffed
with
truffles
and
i
felt
convinced
that
my
two
nymphs
must
have
some
rudimentary
ideas
on
the
subject
of
stimulants
i
should
have
passed
the
time
pleasantly
enough
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
occasional
visits
of
a
rat
who
nearly
made
me
sick
with
his
disgusting
odour
i
remembered
that
i
had
been
annoyed
in
the
same
way
at
cologne
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
at
last
ten
struck
and
i
heard
the
pastor
voice
as
he
came
downstairs
talking
he
warned
the
girls
not
to
play
any
tricks
together
and
to
go
to
sleep
quietly
that
brought
back
to
my
memory
rose
leaving
madame
orio
house
at
venice
years
before
and
reflecting
on
my
character
i
found
myself
much
changed
though
not
more
reasonable
but
if
i
was
not
so
sensible
to
the
charms
of
the
sex
the
two
beauties
who
were
awaiting
me
were
much
superior
to
madame
nieces
in
my
long
and
profligate
career
in
which
i
have
turned
the
heads
of
some
hundreds
of
ladies
i
have
become
familiar
with
all
the
methods
of
seduction
but
my
guiding
principle
has
been
never
to
direct
my
attack
against
novices
or
those
whose
prejudices
were
likely
to
prove
an
obstacle
except
in
the
presence
of
another
woman
i
soon
found
out
that
timidity
makes
a
girl
averse
to
being
seduced
while
in
company
with
another
girl
she
is
easily
conquered
the
weakness
of
the
one
brings
on
the
fall
of
the
other
fathers
and
mothers
are
of
the
contrary
opinion
but
they
are
in
the
wrong
they
will
not
trust
their
daughter
to
take
a
walk
or
go
to
a
ball
with
a
young
man
but
if
she
has
another
girl
with
her
there
is
no
difficulty
made
i
repeat
they
are
in
the
wrong
if
the
young
man
has
the
requisite
skill
their
daughter
is
a
lost
woman
a
feeling
of
false
shame
hinders
them
from
making
an
absolute
and
determined
resistance
and
the
first
step
once
taken
the
rest
comes
inevitably
and
quickly
the
girl
grants
some
small
favour
and
immediately
makes
her
friend
grant
a
much
greater
one
to
hide
her
own
blushes
and
if
the
seducer
is
clever
at
his
trade
the
young
innocent
will
soon
have
gone
too
far
to
be
able
to
draw
back
besides
the
more
innocence
a
girl
has
the
less
she
knows
of
the
methods
of
seduction
before
she
has
had
time
to
think
pleasure
attracts
her
curiosity
draws
her
a
little
farther
and
opportunity
does
the
rest
for
example
i
might
possibly
have
been
able
to
seduce
hedvig
without
helen
but
i
am
certain
i
should
never
have
succeeded
with
helen
if
she
had
not
seen
her
cousin
take
liberties
with
me
which
she
no
doubt
thought
contrary
to
the
feelings
of
modesty
which
a
respectable
young
woman
ought
to
have
though
i
do
not
repent
of
my
amorous
exploits
i
am
far
from
wishing
that
my
example
should
serve
for
the
perversion
of
the
fair
sex
who
have
so
many
claims
on
my
homage
i
desire
that
what
i
say
may
be
a
warning
to
fathers
and
mothers
and
secure
me
a
place
in
their
esteem
at
any
rate
soon
after
the
pastor
had
gone
i
heard
three
light
knocks
on
my
prison
door
i
opened
it
and
my
hand
was
folded
in
a
palm
as
soft
as
satin
all
my
being
was
moved
it
was
helen
hand
and
that
happy
moment
had
already
repaid
me
for
my
long
waiting
follow
me
on
tiptoe
she
whispered
as
soon
as
she
had
shut
the
door
but
in
my
impatience
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
and
made
her
feel
the
effect
which
her
mere
presence
had
produced
on
me
while
at
the
same
time
i
assured
myself
of
her
docility
there
she
said
now
come
upstairs
softly
after
me
i
followed
her
as
best
i
could
in
the
darkness
and
she
took
me
along
a
gallery
into
a
dark
room
and
then
into
a
lighted
one
which
contained
hedvig
almost
in
a
state
of
nudity
she
came
to
me
with
open
arms
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
and
embracing
me
ardently
expressed
her
gratitude
for
my
long
and
dreary
imprisonment
divine
hedvig
i
answered
if
i
had
not
loved
you
madly
i
would
not
have
stayed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
that
dismal
cell
but
i
am
ready
to
spend
four
hours
there
every
day
till
i
leave
geneva
for
your
sake
but
we
must
not
lose
any
time
let
us
go
to
bed
do
you
two
go
to
bed
said
helen
i
will
sleep
on
the
sofa
no
no
cried
hedvig
do
think
of
it
our
fate
must
be
exactly
equal
yes
darling
helen
said
i
embracing
her
i
love
you
both
with
equal
ardour
and
these
ceremonies
are
only
wasting
the
time
in
which
i
ought
to
be
assuring
you
of
my
passion
imitate
my
proceedings
i
am
going
to
undress
and
then
i
shall
lie
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
come
and
lie
beside
me
and
i
shew
you
how
i
love
you
if
all
is
safe
i
will
remain
with
you
till
you
send
me
away
but
whatever
you
do
do
not
put
out
the
light
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
discussing
the
theory
of
shame
the
while
with
the
theological
hedvig
i
presented
myself
to
their
gaze
in
the
costume
of
adam
hedvig
blushed
and
parted
with
the
last
shred
of
her
modesty
citing
the
opinion
of
clement
alexandrinus
that
the
seat
of
shame
is
in
the
shirt
i
praised
the
charming
perfection
of
her
shape
in
the
hope
of
encouraging
helen
who
was
slowly
undressing
herself
but
an
accusation
of
mock
modesty
from
her
cousin
had
more
effect
than
all
my
praises
at
last
this
venus
stood
before
me
in
a
state
of
nature
covering
her
most
secret
parts
with
her
hand
and
hiding
one
breast
with
the
other
and
appearing
woefully
ashamed
of
what
she
could
not
conceal
her
modest
confusion
this
strife
between
departing
modesty
and
rising
passion
enchanted
me
hedvig
was
taller
than
helen
her
skin
was
whiter
and
her
breasts
double
the
size
of
helen
but
in
helen
there
was
more
animation
her
shape
was
more
gently
moulded
and
her
breast
might
have
been
the
model
for
the
venus
de
medicis
she
got
bolder
by
degrees
and
we
spent
some
moments
in
admiring
each
other
and
then
we
went
to
bed
nature
spoke
out
loudly
and
all
we
wanted
was
to
satisfy
its
demands
with
much
coolness
i
made
a
woman
of
hedvig
and
when
all
was
over
she
kissed
me
and
said
that
the
pain
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
pleasure
the
turn
of
helen
who
was
six
years
younger
than
hedvig
now
came
but
the
finest
fleece
that
i
have
ever
seen
was
not
won
without
difficulty
she
was
jealous
of
her
cousin
success
and
held
it
open
with
her
two
hands
and
though
she
had
to
submit
to
great
pain
before
being
initiated
into
the
amorous
mysteries
her
sighs
were
sighs
of
happiness
as
she
responded
to
my
ardent
efforts
her
great
charms
and
the
vivacity
of
her
movements
shortened
the
sacrifice
and
when
i
left
the
sanctuary
my
two
sweethearts
saw
that
i
needed
repose
the
alter
was
purified
of
the
blood
of
the
victims
and
we
all
washed
delighted
to
serve
one
another
life
returned
to
me
under
their
curious
fingers
and
the
sight
filled
them
with
joy
i
told
them
that
i
wished
to
enjoy
them
every
night
till
i
left
geneva
but
they
told
me
sadly
that
this
was
impossible
in
five
or
six
days
time
perhaps
the
opportunity
may
recur
again
but
that
will
be
all
ask
us
to
sup
at
your
inn
said
hedvig
and
maybe
chance
will
favour
the
commission
of
a
sweet
felony
i
followed
this
advice
i
overwhelmed
them
with
happiness
for
several
hours
passing
five
or
six
times
from
one
to
the
other
before
i
was
exhausted
in
the
intervals
seeing
them
to
be
docile
and
desirous
i
made
them
execute
aretin
most
complicated
postures
which
amused
them
beyond
words
we
kissed
whatever
took
our
fancy
and
just
as
hedvig
applied
her
lips
to
the
mouth
of
the
pistol
it
went
off
and
the
discharge
inundated
her
face
and
her
bosom
she
was
delighted
and
watched
the
process
to
the
end
with
all
the
curiosity
of
a
doctor
the
night
seemed
short
though
we
had
not
lost
a
moment
time
and
at
daybreak
we
had
to
part
i
left
them
in
bed
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
away
without
being
observed
i
slept
till
noon
and
then
having
made
my
toilette
i
went
to
call
on
the
pastor
to
whom
i
praised
hedvig
to
the
skies
this
was
the
best
way
to
get
him
to
come
to
supper
at
balances
the
next
day
we
shall
be
in
the
town
said
i
and
can
remain
together
as
long
as
we
please
but
do
not
forget
to
bring
the
amiable
widow
and
her
charming
daughter
he
promised
he
would
bring
them
both
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
the
syndic
and
his
three
friends
who
naturally
found
me
rather
insensible
to
their
charms
i
excused
myself
by
saying
that
i
had
a
bad
headache
i
told
them
that
i
had
asked
the
young
theologian
to
supper
and
invited
the
girls
and
the
syndic
to
come
too
but
as
i
had
foreseen
the
latter
would
not
hear
of
their
going
as
it
would
give
rise
to
gossip
i
took
care
that
the
most
exquisite
wines
should
form
an
important
feature
of
my
supper
the
pastor
and
the
widow
were
both
sturdy
drinkers
and
i
did
my
best
to
please
them
when
i
saw
that
they
were
pretty
mellow
and
were
going
over
their
old
recollections
i
made
a
sign
to
the
girls
and
they
immediately
went
out
as
if
to
go
to
a
under
pretext
of
shewing
them
the
way
i
went
out
too
and
took
them
into
a
room
telling
them
to
wait
for
me
i
went
back
to
the
and
finding
the
old
friends
taken
up
with
each
other
and
scarcely
conscious
of
my
presence
i
gave
them
some
punch
and
told
them
that
i
would
keep
the
young
ladies
company
they
were
looking
at
some
pictures
i
explained
i
lost
no
time
and
shewed
them
some
extremely
interesting
sights
these
stolen
sweets
have
a
wonderful
charm
when
we
were
to
some
extent
satisfied
we
went
back
and
i
plied
the
more
and
more
freely
helen
praised
the
pictures
to
her
mother
and
asked
her
to
come
and
look
at
them
i
do
care
to
she
replied
well
said
helen
let
us
go
and
see
them
again
i
thought
this
stratagem
admissible
and
going
out
with
my
two
sweethearts
i
worked
wonders
hedvig
philosophised
over
pleasure
and
told
me
she
would
never
have
known
it
if
i
had
not
chanced
to
meet
her
uncle
helen
did
not
speak
she
was
more
voluptuous
than
her
cousin
and
swelled
out
like
a
dove
and
came
to
life
only
to
expire
a
moment
afterwards
i
wondered
at
her
astonishing
fecundity
while
i
was
engaged
in
one
operation
she
passed
from
death
to
life
fourteen
times
it
is
true
that
it
was
the
sixth
time
with
me
so
i
made
my
progress
rather
slower
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
she
took
in
it
before
we
parted
i
agreed
to
call
on
helen
mother
every
day
to
ascertain
the
night
i
could
spend
with
them
before
i
left
geneva
we
broke
up
our
party
at
two
in
the
morning
three
or
four
days
after
helen
told
me
briefly
that
hedvig
was
to
sleep
with
her
that
night
and
that
she
would
leave
the
door
open
at
the
same
time
as
before
i
will
be
there
and
i
will
be
there
to
shut
you
up
but
you
can
not
have
a
light
as
the
servant
might
see
it
i
was
exact
to
the
time
and
when
ten
struck
they
came
to
fetch
me
in
high
glee
i
forgot
to
tell
you
said
helen
that
you
would
find
a
fowl
there
i
felt
hungry
and
made
short
work
of
it
and
then
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
happiness
i
had
to
set
out
on
my
travels
in
two
days
i
had
received
a
couple
of
letters
from
raiberti
in
the
first
he
told
me
that
he
had
followed
my
instructions
as
to
the
corticelli
and
in
the
second
that
she
would
probably
he
paid
for
dancing
at
the
carnival
as
first
i
had
nothing
to
keep
me
at
geneva
and
madame
according
to
our
agreement
would
be
waiting
for
me
at
lyons
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
there
thus
the
night
that
i
was
to
pass
with
my
two
charmers
would
be
my
last
my
lessons
had
taken
effect
and
i
found
they
had
become
past
mistresses
in
the
art
of
pleasure
but
now
and
again
joy
gave
place
to
sadness
we
shall
be
wretched
sweetheart
said
hedvig
and
if
you
like
we
will
come
with
you
i
promise
to
come
and
see
you
before
two
years
have
expired
said
i
and
in
fact
they
had
not
so
long
to
wait
we
fell
asleep
at
midnight
and
waking
at
four
renewed
our
sweet
battles
till
six
half
an
hour
after
i
left
them
worn
out
with
my
exertions
and
i
remained
in
bed
all
day
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
the
syndic
and
his
young
friends
i
found
helen
there
and
she
was
cunning
enough
to
feign
not
to
be
more
vexed
at
my
departure
than
the
others
and
to
further
the
deception
she
allowed
the
syndic
to
kiss
her
i
followed
suit
and
begged
her
to
bid
farewell
for
me
to
her
learned
cousin
and
to
excuse
my
taking
leave
of
her
in
person
the
next
day
i
set
out
in
the
early
morning
and
on
the
following
day
i
reached
lyons
madame
was
not
there
she
had
gone
to
an
estate
of
hers
at
bresse
i
found
a
letter
in
which
she
said
that
she
would
be
delighted
to
see
me
and
i
waited
on
her
without
losing
any
time
she
greeted
me
with
her
ordinary
cordiality
and
i
told
her
that
i
was
going
to
turin
to
meet
frederic
gualdo
the
head
of
the
fraternity
of
the
rosy
cross
and
i
revealed
to
her
by
the
oracle
that
he
would
come
with
me
to
marseilles
and
that
there
he
would
complete
her
happiness
after
having
received
this
oracle
she
would
not
go
to
paris
before
she
saw
us
the
oracle
also
bade
her
wait
for
me
at
lyons
with
young
who
begged
me
to
take
him
with
me
to
turin
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
succeeded
in
putting
him
off
madame
had
to
wait
a
fortnight
to
get
me
fifty
thousand
francs
which
i
might
require
on
my
journey
in
the
course
of
this
fortnight
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
madame
pernon
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
with
her
husband
a
rich
mercer
in
refurnishing
my
wardrobe
madame
pernon
was
handsome
and
intelligent
she
had
a
milanese
lover
named
bono
who
did
business
for
a
swiss
banker
named
sacco
it
was
through
madame
peron
that
bono
got
madame
the
fifty
thousand
francs
i
required
she
also
gave
me
the
three
dresses
which
she
had
promised
to
the
countess
of
lascaris
but
which
that
lady
had
never
seen
one
of
these
dresses
was
furred
and
was
exquisitely
beautiful
i
left
lyons
equipped
like
a
prince
and
journeyed
towards
turin
where
i
was
to
meet
the
famous
gualdo
who
was
none
other
than
ascanio
pogomas
whom
i
had
summoned
from
berne
i
thought
it
would
be
easy
to
make
the
fellow
play
the
part
i
had
destined
for
him
but
i
was
cruelly
deceived
as
the
reader
will
see
i
could
not
resist
stopping
at
chamberi
to
see
my
fair
nun
whom
i
found
looking
beautiful
and
contented
she
was
grieving
however
after
the
young
boarder
who
had
been
taken
from
the
convent
and
married
i
got
to
turin
at
the
beginning
of
december
and
at
rivoli
i
found
the
corticelli
who
had
been
warned
by
the
chevalier
de
raiberti
of
my
arrival
she
gave
me
a
letter
from
this
worthy
gentleman
giving
the
address
of
the
house
he
had
taken
for
me
as
i
did
not
want
to
put
up
at
an
inn
i
immediately
went
to
take
possession
of
my
new
lodging
chapter
xvii
my
old
friends
pacienza
agatha
count
boryomeo
the
ball
lord
percy
the
corticelli
was
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
left
me
as
we
got
into
turin
i
promised
i
would
come
and
see
her
and
immediately
went
to
the
house
the
chevalier
had
taken
which
i
found
convenient
in
every
way
the
worthy
chevalier
was
not
long
in
calling
on
me
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
moneys
he
had
spent
on
the
corticelli
and
handed
over
the
rest
to
me
i
am
flush
of
money
i
said
and
i
intend
to
invite
my
friends
to
supper
frequently
can
you
lay
your
hands
on
a
good
cook
i
know
a
pearl
amongst
cooks
said
he
and
you
can
have
him
directly
you
chevalier

this
wonder

him

month
the
cook
who
was
an
excellent
one
came
the
same
evening
it
would
be
a
good
idea
said
raiberti
to
call
on
the
count
he
knows
that
the
corticelli
is
your
mistress
and
he
has
given
a
formal
order
to
madame
pacienza
the
lady
with
whom
she
lives
that
when
you
come
and
see
her
you
are
not
to
be
left
alone
together
this
order
amused
me
and
as
i
did
not
care
about
the
corticelli
it
did
not
trouble
me
in
the
least
though
raiberti
who
thought
i
was
in
love
with
her
seemed
to
pity
me
since
she
has
been
here
he
said
her
conduct
has
been
irreproachable
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
might
let
her
take
some
lessons
from
the
dupre
said
he
he
will
no
doubt
give
her
something
to
do
at
the
carnival
i
promised
to
follow
his
advice
and
i
then
paid
a
visit
to
the
superintendent
of
police
he
received
me
well
complimented
me
on
my
return
to
turin
and
then
added
with
a
smile
i
warn
you
that
i
have
been
informed
that
you
keep
a
mistress
and
that
i
have
given
strict
orders
to
the
respectable
woman
with
whom
she
lives
not
to
leave
her
alone
with
you
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
replied
and
the
more
as
i
fear
her
mother
is
not
a
person
of
very
rigid
morals
i
advised
the
chevalier
raiberti
of
my
intentions
with
regard
to
her
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
he
has
carried
them
out
so
well
i
hope
the
girl
will
shew
herself
worthy
of
your
protection
do
you
think
of
staying
here
throughout
the
carnival
yes
if
your
excellency
approves
it
depends
entirely
on
your
good
conduct
a
few
peccadilloes
excepted
my
conduct
is
always
above
reproach
there
are
some
peccadilloes
we
do
not
tolerate
here
have
you
seen
the
chevalier
osorio
i
think
of
calling
on
him
or
i
hope
you
will
remember
me
to
him
he
rang
his
bell
bowed
and
the
audience
was
over
the
chevalier
osorio
received
me
at
his
office
and
gave
me
a
most
gracious
reception
after
i
had
given
him
an
account
of
my
visit
to
the
superintendent
he
asked
me
with
a
smile
if
i
felt
inclined
to
submit
with
docility
to
not
seeing
my
mistress
in
freedom
certainly
said
i
for
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
osorio
looked
at
me
slyly
and
observed
somehow
i
do
think
your
indifference
will
be
very
pleasing
to
the
virtuous
duenna
i
understood
what
he
meant
but
personally
i
was
delighted
not
to
be
able
to
see
the
corticelli
save
in
the
presence
of
a
female
dragon
it
would
make
people
talk
and
i
loved
a
little
scandal
and
felt
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
when
i
returned
to
my
house
i
found
the
genoese
passano
a
bad
poet
and
worse
painter
to
whom
i
had
intended
to
give
the
part
of
a
rosicrucian
because
there
was
something
in
his
appearance
which
inspired
if
not
respect
at
least
awe
and
a
certain
feeling
of
fear
in
point
of
fact
this
was
only
a
natural
presentiment
that
the
man
must
be
either
a
clever
rogue
or
a
morose
and
sullen
scholar
i
made
him
sup
with
me
and
gave
him
a
room
on
the
third
floor
telling
him
not
to
leave
it
without
my
permission
at
supper
i
found
him
insipid
in
conversation
drunken
ignorant
and
ill
disposed
and
i
already
repented
of
having
taken
him
under
my
protection
but
the
thing
was
done
the
next
day
feeling
curious
to
see
how
the
corticelli
was
lodged
i
called
on
her
taking
with
me
a
piece
of
lyons
silk
i
found
her
and
her
mother
in
the
landlady
room
and
as
i
came
in
the
latter
said
that
she
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
that
she
hoped
i
would
often
dine
with
them
i
thanked
her
briefly
and
spoke
to
the
girl
coolly
enough
shew
me
your
room
said
i
she
took
me
there
in
her
mother
company
here
is
something
to
make
you
a
winter
dress
said
i
skewing
her
the
silk
is
this
from
the
marchioness
no
it
is
from
me
but
where
are
the
three
dresses
she
said
she
would
give
me
you
know
very
well
on
what
conditions
you
were
to
have
them
so
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
she
unfolded
the
silk
which
she
liked
very
much
but
she
said
she
must
have
some
trimmings
the
pacienza
offered
her
services
and
said
she
would
send
for
a
dressmaker
who
lived
close
by
i
acquiesced
with
a
nod
and
as
soon
as
she
had
left
the
room
the
signora
laura
said
she
was
very
sorry
only
to
be
able
to
receive
me
in
the
presence
of
the
landlady
i
should
have
thought
said
i
that
a
virtuous
person
like
you
would
have
been
delighted
i
thank
god
for
it
every
morning
and
night
you
infernal
old
hypocrite
said
i
looking
contemptuously
at
her
upon
my
word
anybody
who
did
know
you
would
be
taken
in
in
a
few
minutes
victorine
and
another
girl
came
in
with
their
are
you
still
at
madame
r
said
i
yes
sir
said
she
with
a
blush
when
the
corticelli
had
chosen
what
she
wanted
i
told
victorine
to
present
my
compliments
to
her
mistress
and
tell
her
that
i
would
call
and
pay
for
the
articles
the
landlady
had
also
sent
for
a
dressmaker
and
while
the
corticelli
was
being
measured
she
shewed
me
her
figure
and
said
she
wanted
a
corset
i
jested
on
the
pregnancy
with
which
she
threatened
me
and
of
which
there
was
now
no
trace
pitying
count
n
for
being
deprived
of
the
joys
of
fatherhood
i
then
gave
her
what
money
she
required
and
took
my
leave
she
escorted
me
to
the
door
and
asked
me
if
she
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
again
before
long
it
a
pleasure
is
it
i
replied
well
i
do
know
when
you
will
have
it
again
it
depends
on
my
leisure
and
my
fancy
it
is
certain
that
if
i
had
any
amorous
feelings
or
even
curiosity
about
the
girl
i
should
not
have
left
her
in
that
house
for
a
moment
but
i
repeat
my
love
for
her
had
entirely
vanished
there
was
one
thing
however
which
annoyed
me
intolerably
namely
that
in
spite
of
my
coolness
towards
her
the
little
hussy
pretended
to
think
that
i
had
forgotten
and
forgiven
everything
on
leaving
the
corticelli
i
proceeded
to
call
on
my
bankers
amongst
others
on
martin
whose
wife
was
justly
famous
for
her
wit
and
beauty
i
chanced
to
meet
the
jew
who
had
made
money
out
of
me
by
means
of
his
daughter
leah
she
was
still
pretty
but
married
and
her
figure
was
too
rounded
for
my
taste
she
and
her
husband
welcomed
me
with
great
warmth
but
i
cared
for
her
no
longer
and
did
not
wish
to
see
her
again
i
called
on
madame
r
who
had
been
awaiting
me
impatiently
ever
since
victorine
had
brought
news
of
me
i
sat
down
by
the
counter
and
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
from
her
lips
the
amorous
histories
of
turin
for
the
past
few
months
victorine
and
caton
are
the
only
two
of
the
old
set
that
still
remain
but
i
have
replaced
them
with
others
has
victorine
found
anyone
to
operate
on
her
yet
no
she
is
just
as
you
left
her
but
a
gentleman
who
is
in
love
with
her
is
going
to
take
her
to
milan
this
gentleman
was
the
comte
de
perouse
whose
acquaintance
i
made
three
years
afterwards
at
milan
i
shall
speak
of
him
in
due
time
madame
r
told
me
that
in
consequence
of
her
getting
into
trouble
several
times
with
the
police
she
had
been
obliged
to
promise
the
count
only
to
send
the
girls
to
ladies
and
consequently
if
i
found
any
of
them
to
my
taste
i
should
be
obliged
to
make
friends
with
their
relations
and
take
them
to
the
festas
she
shewed
me
the
girls
in
the
but
i
did
not
think
any
of
them
worth
taking
trouble
about
she
talked
about
the
pacienza
and
when
i
told
her
that
i
kept
the
corticelli
and
of
the
hard
conditions
to
which
i
was
obliged
to
submit
she
exclaimed
with
astonishment
and
amused
me
by
her
jests
on
the
subject
you
are
in
good
hands
my
dear
sir
said
she
the
woman
is
not
only
a
spy
of
but
a
professional
procuress
i
wonder
the
chevalier
raiberti
placed
the
girl
with
her
she
was
not
so
surprised
when
i
told
her
that
the
chevalier
had
good
reasons
for
his
action
and
that
i
myself
had
good
reasons
of
my
own
for
wishing
the
corticelli
to
remain
there
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
customer
who
wanted
silk
stockings
hearing
him
speak
of
dancing
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
the
address
of
dupre
the
no
one
better
sir
for
i
am
dupre
at
your
service
i
am
delighted
at
this
happy
chance
the
chevalier
raiberti
gave
me
to
understand
that
you
might
be
able
to
give
dancing
lessons
to
a
of
my
acquaintance
de
raiberti
mentioned
your
name
to
me
this
morning
you
must
be
the
chevalier
de
seingalt
exactly
i
can
give
the
young
lady
lessons
every
morning
at
nine
at
my
own
home
no
do
you
come
to
her
house
but
at
whatever
hour
you
like
i
will
pay
you
and
i
hope
you
will
make
her
one
of
your
best
pupils
i
must
warn
you
however
that
she
is
not
a
novice
i
will
call
on
her
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
can
make
of
her
but
i
think
i
had
better
tell
you
my
terms
i
charge
three
piedmontese
livres
a
lesson
i
think
that
is
very
reasonable
i
will
call
on
you
you
do
me
honour
here
is
my
address
if
you
like
to
come
in
the
afternoon
you
will
see
the
rehearsal
of
a
ballet
is
it
not
rehearsed
at
the
theatre
yes
but
at
the
theatre
no
are
allowed
by
the
orders
of
the
superintendent
of
police
this
superintendent
of
yours
puts
his
finger
into
a
good
many
pies
in
too
many
but
at
your
own
house
anybody
may
come
undoubtedly
but
i
could
not
have
the
dancers
there
if
my
wife
were
not
present
the
superintendent
knows
her
and
has
great
confidence
in
her
you
will
see
me
at
the
rehearsal
the
wretched
superintendent
had
erected
a
fearful
system
of
surveillance
against
the
lovers
of
pleasure
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
was
often
cheated
voluptuousness
was
all
the
more
rampant
when
thus
restrained
and
so
it
ever
will
be
while
men
have
passions
and
women
desires
to
love
and
enjoy
to
desire
and
to
satisfy
one
desires
such
is
the
circle
in
which
we
move
and
whence
we
can
never
be
turned
when
restrictions
are
placed
upon
the
passions
as
in
turkey
they
still
attain
their
ends
but
by
methods
destructive
to
morality
at
the
worthy
mazzali
i
found
two
gentlemen
to
whom
she
introduced
me
one
was
old
and
ugly
decorated
with
the
order
of
the
white
eagle
his
name
was
count
borromeo
the
other
young
and
brisk
was
count
a
b
of
milan
after
they
had
gone
i
was
informed
that
they
were
paying
assiduous
court
to
the
chevalier
raiberti
from
whom
they
hoped
to
obtain
certain
privileges
for
their
lordships
which
were
under
the
sardinian
rule
the
milanese
count
had
not
a
penny
and
the
lord
of
the
borromean
isles
was
not
much
better
off
he
had
ruined
himself
with
women
and
not
being
able
to
live
at
milan
he
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fairest
of
his
isles
and
enjoyed
there
perpetual
spring
and
very
little
else
i
paid
him
a
visit
on
my
return
from
spain
but
i
shall
relate
our
meeting
when
i
come
to
my
adventures
my
pleasures
my
misfortunes
and
above
all
my
follies
there
for
of
such
threads
was
the
weft
of
my
life
composed
and
folly
was
the
prominent
element
the
conversation
turned
on
my
house
and
the
lively
mazzoli
asked
me
how
i
liked
my
cook
i
replied
that
i
had
not
yet
tried
him
but
i
proposed
to
put
him
to
test
the
next
day
if
she
and
the
gentlemen
would
do
me
the
honour
of
supping
with
me
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
she
promised
to
bring
her
dear
chevalier
with
her
and
to
warn
him
of
the
event
as
his
health
only
allowed
him
to
eat
once
a
day
i
called
on
dupre
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
the
dancers
male
and
female
the
latter
accompanied
by
their
mothers
who
stood
on
one
side
muffled
up
in
thick
cloaks
as
i
passed
them
under
review
in
my
lordly
manner
i
noticed
that
one
of
them
still
looked
fresh
and
pretty
which
augured
well
for
her
daughter
though
the
fruit
does
not
always
correspond
to
the
tree
dupre
introduced
me
to
his
wife
who
was
young
and
pretty
but
who
had
been
obliged
to
leave
the
theatre
owing
to
the
weakness
of
her
chest
she
told
me
that
if
the
corticelli
would
work
hard
her
husband
would
make
a
great
dancer
of
her
as
her
figure
was
eminently
suited
for
dancing
while
i
was
talking
with
madame
dupre
the
corticelli
late
lascaris
came
running
up
to
me
with
the
air
of
a
favourite
and
told
me
she
wanted
some
ribbons
and
laces
to
make
a
bonnet
the
others
girls
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
and
guessing
what
they
must
be
saying
i
turned
to
dupre
without
taking
any
notice
of
madame
madcap
and
gave
him
twelve
pistoles
saying
that
i
would
pay
for
the
lessons
three
months
in
advance
and
that
i
hoped
he
would
bring
his
new
pupil
on
well
such
a
heavy
payment
in
advance
caused
general
surprise
which
i
enjoyed
though
pretending
not
to
be
aware
of
it
now
i
know
that
i
acted
foolishly
but
i
have
promised
to
speak
the
truth
in
these
memoirs
which
will
not
see
the
light
till
all
light
has
left
my
eyes
and
i
will
keep
my
promise
i
have
always
been
greedy
of
distinction
i
have
always
loved
to
draw
the
eyes
of
men
towards
men
but
i
must
also
add
that
if
i
have
humiliated
anyone
it
has
always
been
a
proud
man
or
a
fool
for
it
has
been
my
rule
to
please
everyone
if
i
can
i
sat
on
one
side
the
better
to
observe
the
swarm
of
girls
and
i
soon
fixed
my
eyes
on
one
whose
appearance
struck
me
she
had
a
fine
figure
delicate
features
a
noble
air
and
a
patient
look
which
interested
me
in
the
highest
degree
she
was
dancing
with
a
man
who
did
not
scruple
to
abuse
her
in
the
coarsest
manner
when
she
made
any
mistakes
but
she
bore
it
without
replying
though
an
expression
of
contempt
mingled
with
the
sweetness
of
her
face
instinct
drew
me
to
the
mother
i
have
remarked
on
and
i
asked
her
to
whom
the
dancer
that
interested
me
belonged
i
am
her
mother
she
replied
you
madam
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
i
was
very
young
when
she
was
born
i
should
think
so
where
do
you
come
from
i
am
from
lucca
and
what
is
poor
widow
how
can
you
be
poor
when
you
are
still
young
and
handsome
and
have
an
angel
for
a
daughter
she
replied
only
by
an
expressive
glance
i
understood
her
reserve
and
i
stayed
by
her
without
speaking
soon
after
agatha
as
her
daughter
was
named
came
up
to
her
to
ask
for
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
face
allow
me
to
offer
you
mine
said
i
it
was
a
white
handkerchief
and
scented
with
attar
of
roses
this
latter
circumstance
gave
her
an
excuse
for
accepting
it
but
after
smelling
it
she
wanted
to
return
it
to
me
you
have
not
used
it
said
i
do
so
she
obeyed
and
then
returned
it
to
me
with
a
bow
by
way
of
thanks
you
must
not
give
it
me
back
fair
agatha
till
you
have
had
it
washed
she
smiled
and
gave
it
to
her
mother
glancing
at
me
in
a
grateful
manner
which
i
considered
of
good
omen
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
you
said
i
i
can
not
receive
you
sir
except
in
the
presence
of
my
landlady
this
cursed
restriction
is
general
in
turin
then
yes
the
superintendent
uses
everybody
in
the
same
way
then
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
here
in
the
evening
i
had
one
of
the
best
suppers
i
ever
had
in
my
life
if
i
except
those
i
enjoyed
during
my
stay
at
turin
my
cook
was
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
kitchen
of
lucullus
but
without
detracting
from
his
skill
i
must
do
justice
to
the
products
of
the
country
everything
is
delicious
game
fish
birds
meat
vegetables
fruit
milk
and
truffles
all
are
worthy
of
the
table
of
the
greatest
gourmets
and
the
wines
of
the
country
yield
to
none
what
a
pity
that
strangers
do
not
enjoy
liberty
at
turin
it
is
true
that
better
society
and
more
politeness
such
as
are
found
in
several
french
and
italian
towns
are
to
be
wished
for
the
beauty
of
the
women
of
turin
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
excellence
of
the
air
and
diet
i
had
not
much
trouble
in
extracting
a
promise
from
madame
mazzoli
and
the
two
counts
to
sup
with
me
every
night
but
the
chevalier
de
raiberti
would
only
promise
to
come
whenever
he
could
at
the
carignan
theatre
where
was
being
played
i
saw
redegonde
with
whom
i
had
failed
at
florence
she
saw
me
in
the
pit
and
gave
me
a
smile
so
i
wrote
to
her
offering
my
services
if
the
mother
had
changed
her
way
of
thinking
she
answered
that
her
mother
was
always
the
same
but
that
if
i
would
ask
the
corticelli
she
could
come
and
sup
with
me
though
the
mother
would
doubtless
have
to
be
of
the
party
i
gave
her
no
answer
as
the
terms
she
named
were
by
no
means
to
my
taste
i
had
a
letter
from
madame
du
rumain
enclosing
one
from
de
choiseul
to
de
chauvelin
the
french
ambassador
at
turin
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
had
known
this
worthy
nobleman
at
soleure
and
had
been
treated
with
great
politeness
by
him
but
i
wished
to
have
a
more
perfect
title
to
his
acquaintance
hence
i
asked
madame
du
rumain
to
give
me
a
letter
de
chauvelin
received
me
with
the
greatest
cordiality
and
reproaching
me
for
having
thought
a
letter
of
introduction
necessary
introduced
me
to
his
charming
wife
who
was
no
less
kind
than
her
husband
three
or
four
days
later
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
and
i
met
at
his
table
imberti
the
venetian
ambassador
who
said
he
was
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
present
me
at
court
on
hearing
the
reason
de
chauvelin
offered
to
present
me
himself
but
i
thought
it
best
to
decline
with
thanks
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
a
great
honour
but
the
result
would
be
that
i
should
be
more
spied
on
than
even
in
this
town
of
spies
where
the
most
indifferent
actions
do
not
pass
unnoticed
my
pleasures
would
have
been
interfered
with
count
borromeo
continued
to
honour
me
by
coming
every
night
to
sup
with
me
preserving
his
dignity
the
while
for
as
he
accompanied
madame
mazzoli
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
came
because
he
was
in
need
of
a
meal
count
a
b
came
more
frankly
and
i
was
pleased
with
him
he
told
me
one
day
that
the
way
i
put
up
with
his
visits
made
him
extremely
grateful
to
providence
for
his
wife
could
not
send
him
any
money
and
he
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
his
dinner
at
the
inn
so
that
if
it
were
not
for
my
kindness
he
would
often
be
obliged
to
go
hungry
to
bed
he
shewed
me
his
wife
letters
he
had
evidently
a
high
opinion
of
her
i
hope
he
would
say
that
you
will
come
and
stay
with
us
at
milan
and
that
she
will
please
you
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
spain
and
by
what
he
said
i
judged
his
wife
to
be
a
pleasing
brunette
of
or
the
count
had
told
her
how
i
had
lent
him
money
several
times
and
of
my
goodness
to
him
and
she
replied
begging
him
to
express
her
gratitude
to
me
and
to
make
me
promise
to
stay
with
them
at
milan
she
wrote
wittily
and
her
letters
interested
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
gave
a
formal
promise
to
journey
to
milan
if
it
were
only
for
the
sake
of
seeing
her
i
confess
that
in
doing
so
i
was
overcome
by
my
feelings
of
curiosity
i
knew
they
were
poor
and
i
should
not
have
given
a
promise
which
would
either
bring
them
into
difficulties
or
expose
me
to
paying
too
dearly
for
my
lodging
however
by
way
of
excuse
i
can
only
say
that
curiosity
is
near
akin
to
love
i
fancied
the
countess
sensible
like
an
englishwoman
passionate
like
a
spaniard
caressing
like
a
frenchwoman
and
as
i
had
a
good
enough
opinion
of
my
own
merit
i
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
she
would
respond
to
my
affection
with
these
pleasant
delusions
in
my
head
i
counted
on
exciting
the
jealousy
of
all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
milan
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
i
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
spending
it
nevertheless
i
went
every
day
to
rehearsal
at
dupre
and
i
soon
got
madly
in
love
with
agatha
madame
dupre
won
over
by
several
presents
i
made
her
received
my
confidences
with
kindness
and
by
asking
agatha
and
her
mother
to
dinner
procured
me
the
pleasure
of
a
more
private
meeting
with
my
charmer
i
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
make
known
my
feelings
and
i
obtained
some
slight
favours
but
so
slight
were
they
that
my
flame
only
grew
the
fiercer
agatha
kept
on
telling
me
that
everybody
knew
that
the
corticelli
was
my
mistress
and
that
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
she
would
not
have
it
said
that
she
was
my
last
shift
as
i
could
not
see
the
corticelli
in
private
i
swore
to
her
that
i
did
not
love
the
corticelli
and
that
i
only
kept
her
to
prevent
raiberti
being
compromised
but
all
this
was
of
no
avail
she
had
formed
her
plans
and
nothing
would
content
her
but
a
formal
rupture
which
would
give
all
turin
to
understand
that
i
loved
her
and
her
alone
on
these
conditions
she
promised
me
her
heart
and
everything
which
follows
in
such
cases
i
loved
her
too
well
not
to
endeavour
to
satisfy
her
since
my
satisfaction
depended
on
hers
with
this
idea
i
got
dupre
to
give
a
ball
at
my
expense
in
some
house
outside
the
town
and
to
invite
all
the
dancers
male
and
female
who
were
engaged
for
the
carnival
at
turin
every
gentleman
had
the
right
to
bring
a
lady
to
have
supper
and
look
on
as
only
the
professional
dancers
were
allowed
to
dance
i
told
dupre
that
i
would
look
after
the
refreshment
department
and
that
he
might
tell
everybody
that
no
expense
was
to
be
spared
i
also
provided
carriages
and
for
the
ladies
but
nobody
was
to
know
that
i
was
furnishing
the
money
dupre
saw
that
there
was
profit
in
store
for
him
and
went
about
it
at
once
he
found
a
suitable
house
asked
the
lady
dancers
and
distributed
about
fifty
tickets
agatha
and
her
mother
were
the
only
persons
who
knew
that
the
project
was
mine
and
that
i
was
responsible
to
a
great
extent
for
the
expenses
but
these
facts
were
generally
known
the
day
after
the
ball
agatha
had
no
dress
that
was
good
enough
so
i
charged
madame
dupre
to
provide
one
at
my
expense
and
i
was
well
served
it
is
well
known
that
when
this
sort
of
people
dip
their
fingers
into
other
purses
they
are
not
sparing
but
that
was
just
what
i
wanted
agatha
promised
to
dance
all
the
quadrilles
with
me
and
to
return
to
turin
with
madame
dupre
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
ball
i
stayed
to
dinner
at
the
dupre
to
be
present
at
agatha
toilette
her
dress
was
a
rich
and
lyons
silk
and
the
trimming
was
exquisite
alencon
point
lace
of
which
the
girl
did
not
know
the
value
madame
r
who
had
arranged
the
dress
and
madame
dupre
had
received
instructions
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
her
when
agatha
was
ready
to
start
i
told
her
that
the
she
was
wearing
were
not
good
enough
for
her
dress
that
true
said
madame
dupre
and
it
a
great
pity
unfortunately
said
the
mother
my
poor
girl
has
got
another
pair
i
have
some
pretty
imitation
pendants
which
i
could
lend
you
said
i
they
are
really
very
brilliant
i
had
taken
care
to
put
the
which
madame
had
intended
for
the
countess
lascaris
in
my
pocket
i
drew
them
out
and
they
were
greatly
admired
one
would
swear
they
were
real
diamonds
said
madame
dupre
i
put
them
in
agatha
ears
she
admired
them
very
much
and
said
that
all
the
other
girls
would
be
jealous
as
they
would
certainly
take
them
for
real
stones
i
went
home
and
made
an
elaborate
toilette
and
on
arriving
at
the
ball
i
found
agatha
dancing
with
lord
percy
a
young
fool
who
was
the
son
of
the
duke
of
northumberland
and
an
extravagant
spendthrift
i
noticed
several
handsome
ladies
from
turin
who
being
merely
onlookers
might
be
thinking
that
the
ball
was
given
for
their
amusement
like
the
fly
on
the
chariot
wheel
all
the
ambassadors
were
present
and
amongst
others
de
chauvelin
who
told
me
that
to
make
everything
complete
my
pretty
housekeeper
at
soleure
was
wanting
the
marquis
and
marchioness
de
prie
were
there
also
the
marquis
did
not
care
to
dance
so
was
playing
a
little
game
of
quinze
with
a
rude
gamester
who
would
not
let
the
marquis
mistress
look
over
his
cards
she
saw
me
but
pretended
not
to
recognize
me
the
trick
i
had
played
her
at
aix
being
probably
enough
to
last
her
for
some
time
the
minuets
came
to
an
end
and
dupre
announced
the
quadrilles
and
i
was
glad
to
see
the
chevalier
dancing
with
the
corticelli
my
partner
was
agatha
who
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
lord
percy
though
she
told
him
that
she
was
fully
engaged
minuets
and
quadrilles
followed
each
other
in
succession
and
refreshments
began
to
make
their
appearance
i
was
delighted
to
see
that
the
refreshment
counter
was
furnished
with
the
utmost
liberality
the
piedmontese
who
are
great
at
calculations
estimated
that
dupre
must
lose
by
it
the
firing
of
champagne
corks
was
continuous
feeling
tired
i
asked
agatha
to
sit
down
and
i
was
telling
her
how
i
loved
her
when
madame
de
chauvelin
and
another
lady
interrupted
us
i
rose
to
give
them
place
and
agatha
imitated
my
example
but
madame
de
chauvelin
made
her
sit
down
beside
her
and
praised
her
dress
and
above
all
the
lace
trimming
the
other
lady
said
how
pretty
her
were
and
what
a
pity
it
was
that
those
imitation
stones
would
lose
their
brilliance
in
time
madame
de
chauvelin
who
knew
something
about
precious
stones
said
that
they
would
never
lose
their
brilliance
as
they
were
diamonds
of
the
first
water
it
is
not
so
she
added
to
agatha
who
in
the
candour
of
her
heart
confessed
that
they
were
imitation
and
that
i
had
lent
them
to
her
at
this
madame
de
chauvelin
burst
out
laughing
and
said
de
seingalt
has
deceived
you
my
dear
child
a
gentleman
of
his
caste
does
not
lend
imitation
jewellery
to
such
a
pretty
girl
as
you
are
your
are
set
with
magnificent
diamonds
she
blushed
for
my
silence
confirmed
the
lady
assertion
and
she
felt
that
the
fact
of
my
having
lent
her
such
stones
was
a
palpable
proof
of
the
great
esteem
in
which
i
held
her
madame
de
chauvelin
asked
me
to
dance
a
minuet
with
agatha
and
my
partner
executed
the
dance
with
wonderful
grace
when
it
was
over
madame
de
chauvelin
thanked
me
and
told
me
that
she
should
always
remember
our
dancing
together
at
soleure
and
that
she
hoped
i
would
dance
again
with
her
at
her
own
house
a
profound
bow
shewed
her
how
flattered
i
felt
by
the
compliment
the
ball
did
not
come
to
an
end
till
four
in
the
morning
and
i
did
not
leave
it
till
i
saw
agatha
going
away
in
the
company
with
madame
dupre
i
was
still
in
bed
the
next
morning
when
my
man
told
me
a
pretty
woman
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
had
her
in
and
was
delighted
to
find
it
was
agatha
mother
i
made
her
sit
down
beside
me
and
gave
her
a
cup
of
chocolate
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
she
drew
my
from
her
pocket
and
said
with
a
smile
that
she
had
just
been
shewing
them
to
a
jeweller
who
had
offered
her
a
thousand
sequins
for
them
the
man
mad
said
i
you
ought
to
have
let
him
have
them
they
are
not
worth
four
sequins
so
saying
i
drew
her
to
my
arms
and
gave
her
a
kiss
feeling
that
she
had
shared
in
the
kiss
and
that
she
seemed
to
like
it
i
went
farther
and
at
last
we
spent
a
couple
of
hours
in
shewing
what
a
high
opinion
we
had
of
each
other
afterwards
we
both
looked
rather
astonished
and
it
was
the
beautiful
mother
who
first
broke
the
silence
am
i
to
tell
my
girl
said
she
with
a
smile
of
the
way
in
which
you
proved
to
me
that
you
love
her
i
leave
that
to
your
discretion
my
dear
said
i
i
have
certainly
proved
that
i
love
you
but
it
does
not
follow
that
i
do
not
adore
your
daughter
in
fact
i
burn
for
her
and
yet
if
we
are
not
careful
to
avoid
being
alone
together
what
has
just
happened
between
us
will
often
happen
again
it
is
hard
to
resist
you
and
it
is
possible
that
i
may
have
occasion
to
speak
to
you
again
in
private
you
may
be
sure
you
will
always
be
welcome
and
all
i
ask
of
you
is
not
to
put
any
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
suit
with
agatha
i
have
also
a
favour
to
ask
if
it
is
within
my
power
you
may
be
sure
i
will
grant
it
very
good
then
tell
me
if
these
are
real
and
what
was
your
intention
in
putting
them
in
my
daughter
ears
the
diamonds
are
perfectly
genuine
and
my
intention
was
that
agatha
should
keep
them
as
a
proof
of
my
affection
she
heaved
a
sigh
and
then
told
me
that
i
might
ask
them
to
supper
with
dupre
and
his
wife
whenever
i
pleased
i
thanked
her
gave
her
ten
sequins
and
sent
her
away
happy
on
reflection
i
decided
that
i
had
never
seen
a
more
sensible
woman
than
agatha
mother
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
announce
the
success
of
my
suit
in
a
more
delicate
or
more
perspicuous
manner
my
readers
will
no
doubt
guess
that
i
seized
the
opportunity
and
brought
this
interesting
affair
to
a
conclusion
the
same
evening
i
asked
dupre
and
his
wife
agatha
and
her
mother
to
sup
with
me
the
next
day
in
addition
to
my
usual
company
but
as
i
was
leaving
dupre
i
had
an
adventure
my
man
who
was
a
great
rascal
but
who
behaved
well
on
this
occasion
ran
up
to
me
panting
for
breath
and
said
triumphantly
sir
i
have
been
looking
for
you
to
warn
you
that
i
have
just
seen
the
chevalier
de
slip
into
madame
pacienza
house
and
i
suspect
he
is
making
an
amorous
call
on
the
corticelli
i
immediately
walked
to
the
abode
of
the
worthy
spy
in
high
spirits
and
hoping
that
my
servant
guess
had
been
correct
i
walked
in
and
found
the
landlady
and
the
mother
sitting
together
without
noticing
them
i
was
making
my
way
towards
the
corticelli
room
when
the
two
old
ladies
arrested
my
course
telling
me
that
the
signora
was
not
well
and
wanted
rest
i
pushed
them
aside
and
entered
the
room
so
swiftly
and
suddenly
that
i
found
the
gentleman
in
a
state
of
nature
while
the
girl
remained
stretched
on
the
bed
as
if
petrified
by
my
sudden
apparition
sir
said
i
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
for
coming
in
without
knocking
wait
a
moment
wait
a
moment
far
from
waiting
i
went
away
in
high
glee
and
told
the
story
to
the
chevalier
raiberti
who
enjoyed
it
as
well
as
i
did
i
asked
him
to
warn
the
pacienza
woman
that
from
that
day
i
would
pay
nothing
for
corticelli
who
had
ceased
to
belong
to
me
he
approved
and
said
i
suppose
you
will
not
be
going
to
complain
to
the
count
it
is
only
fools
who
complain
above
all
in
circumstances
like
these
this
scandalous
story
would
have
been
consigned
to
forgetfulness
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
chevalier
de
indiscretion
he
felt
angry
at
being
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
the
business
and
remembering
he
had
seen
my
man
just
before
fixed
on
him
as
the
informer
meeting
him
in
the
street
the
chevalier
reproached
him
for
spying
whereon
the
impudent
rascal
replied
that
he
was
only
answerable
to
his
master
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
serve
me
in
all
things
on
this
the
chevalier
caned
him
and
the
man
went
to
complain
to
the
superintendent
who
summoned
to
appear
before
him
and
explain
his
conduct
having
nothing
to
fear
he
told
the
whole
story
the
chevalier
de
raiberti
too
was
very
ill
received
when
he
went
to
tell
madame
pacienza
that
neither
he
nor
i
were
going
to
pay
her
anything
more
in
future
but
he
would
listen
to
no
defence
the
chevalier
came
to
sup
with
me
and
he
informed
me
that
on
leaving
the
house
he
had
met
a
police
sergeant
whom
he
concluded
had
come
to
cite
the
landlady
to
appear
before
the
count
the
next
day
just
as
i
was
going
to
de
chauvelin
ball
i
received
to
my
great
surprise
a
note
from
the
superintendent
begging
me
to
call
on
him
as
he
had
something
to
communicate
to
me
i
immediately
ordered
my
chairmen
to
take
me
to
his
residence
de
aglie
received
me
in
private
with
great
politeness
and
after
giving
me
a
chair
he
began
a
long
and
pathetic
discourse
the
gist
of
which
was
that
it
was
my
duty
to
forgive
this
little
slip
of
my
mistress
that
exactly
what
i
am
going
to
do
said
i
and
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
never
wish
to
see
the
corticelli
again
or
to
make
or
mar
in
her
affairs
and
for
all
this
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
the
chevalier
de
i
see
you
are
angry
come
come
you
must
not
abandon
the
girl
for
that
i
will
have
the
woman
pacienza
punished
in
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
you
and
i
will
place
the
girl
in
a
respectable
family
where
you
can
go
and
see
her
in
perfect
liberty
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
indeed
i
am
grateful
but
i
despise
the
pacienza
too
heartily
to
wish
for
her
punishment
and
as
to
the
corticelli
and
her
mother
they
are
two
female
swindlers
who
have
given
me
too
much
trouble
already
i
am
well
quit
of
them
you
must
confess
however
that
you
had
no
right
to
make
a
forcible
entry
into
a
room
in
a
house
which
does
not
belong
to
you
i
had
not
the
right
i
confess
but
if
i
had
not
taken
it
i
could
never
have
had
a
certain
proof
of
the
perfidy
of
my
mistress
and
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
continue
supporting
her
though
she
entertained
other
lovers
the
corticelli
pretends
that
you
are
her
debtor
and
not
vice
versa
she
says
that
the
diamonds
you
have
given
another
girl
belong
of
right
to
her
and
that
madame
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
know
presented
her
with
them
she
is
a
liar
and
as
you
know
madame
kindly
write
to
her
she
is
at
lyons
and
if
the
marchioness
replies
that
i
owe
the
wretched
girl
anything
be
sure
that
i
will
discharge
the
debt
i
have
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
good
banks
of
this
town
and
the
money
will
be
a
sufficient
surety
for
the
i
have
disposed
of
i
am
sorry
that
things
have
happened
so
and
i
am
very
glad
as
i
have
ridden
myself
of
a
burden
that
was
hard
to
bear
thereupon
we
bowed
politely
to
one
another
and
i
left
the
office
at
the
french
ambassador
ball
i
heard
so
much
talk
of
my
adventure
that
at
last
i
refused
to
reply
to
any
more
questions
on
the
subject
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
trifle
of
which
i
could
not
honourably
take
any
notice
but
i
thought
myself
the
best
judge
of
my
own
honour
and
was
determined
to
take
no
notice
of
the
opinions
of
others
the
chevalier
de
came
up
to
me
and
said
that
if
i
abandoned
the
corticelli
for
such
a
trifle
he
should
feel
obliged
to
give
me
satisfaction
i
shook
his
hand
saying
my
dear
chevalier
it
will
be
enough
if
you
do
not
demand
satisfaction
of
me
he
understood
how
the
land
lay
and
said
no
more
about
it
but
not
so
his
sister
the
marchioness
de
prie
who
made
a
vigorous
attack
on
me
after
we
had
danced
together
she
was
handsome
and
might
have
been
victorious
if
she
had
liked
but
luckily
she
did
not
think
of
exerting
her
power
and
so
gained
nothing
three
days
after
madame
de
giles
a
great
power
in
turin
and
a
kind
of
protecting
deity
to
all
actresses
summoned
me
to
her
presence
by
a
liveried
footman
guessing
what
she
wanted
i
called
on
her
unceremoniously
in
a
morning
coat
she
received
me
politely
and
began
to
talk
of
the
corticelli
affair
with
great
affability
but
i
did
not
like
her
and
replied
dryly
that
i
had
had
no
hesitation
in
abandoning
the
girl
to
the
protection
of
the
gallant
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
surprised
her
in
delicto
she
told
me
i
should
be
sorry
for
it
and
that
she
would
publish
a
little
story
which
she
had
already
read
and
which
did
not
do
me
much
credit
i
replied
that
i
never
changed
my
mind
and
that
threats
were
of
no
avail
with
me
with
that
parting
shot
i
left
her
i
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
the
town
gossip
but
a
week
after
i
received
a
manuscript
containing
an
account
accurate
in
most
respects
of
my
relations
with
the
corticelli
and
madame
but
so
ill
written
and
badly
expressed
that
nobody
could
read
it
without
weariness
it
did
not
make
the
slightest
impression
on
me
and
i
stayed
a
fortnight
longer
in
turin
without
its
causing
me
the
slightest
annoyance
i
saw
the
corticelli
again
in
paris
six
months
after
and
will
speak
of
our
meeting
in
due
time
the
day
after
de
chauvelin
ball
i
asked
agatha
her
mother
the
dupres
and
my
usual
company
to
supper
it
was
the
mother
business
to
so
arrange
matters
that
the
should
become
agatha
lawful
property
so
i
left
everything
to
her
i
knew
she
would
manage
to
introduce
the
subject
and
while
we
were
at
supper
she
said
that
the
common
report
of
turin
was
that
i
had
given
her
daughter
a
pair
of
diamond
worth
five
hundred
louis
which
the
corticelli
claimed
as
hers
by
right
i
do
not
know
she
added
if
they
are
real
diamonds
or
if
they
belong
to
the
corticelli
but
i
do
know
that
my
girl
has
received
no
such
present
from
the
gentleman
well
well
said
i
we
will
have
no
more
surmises
in
the
matter
and
going
up
to
agatha
i
put
the
earrings
on
her
saying
dearest
agatha
i
make
you
a
present
of
them
before
this
company
and
my
giving
them
to
you
now
is
a
proof
that
hitherto
they
have
belonged
to
me
everybody
applauded
and
i
read
in
the
girl
eyes
that
i
should
have
no
cause
to
regret
my
generosity
we
then
fell
to
speaking
of
the
affair
of
and
the
corticelli
and
of
the
efforts
that
had
been
made
to
compel
me
to
retain
her
the
chevalier
raiberti
said
that
in
my
place
he
would
have
offered
madame
de
giles
or
the
superintendent
to
continue
paying
for
her
board
but
merely
as
an
act
of
charity
and
that
i
could
have
deposited
money
with
either
of
them
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
so
said
i
and
the
next
day
the
worthy
chevalier
made
the
necessary
arrangements
with
madame
de
giles
and
i
furnished
the
necessary
moneys
in
spite
of
this
charitable
action
the
wretched
manuscript
came
out
but
as
i
have
said
without
doing
me
any
harm
the
superintendent
made
the
corticelli
live
in
the
same
house
with
redegonde
and
madame
pacienza
was
left
in
peace
after
supper
with
the
exception
of
the
chevalier
raiberti
we
all
masked
and
went
to
the
ball
at
the
i
soon
seized
the
opportunity
of
escaping
with
agatha
and
she
granted
me
all
that
love
can
desire
all
constraint
was
banished
she
was
my
titular
mistress
and
we
were
proud
of
belonging
the
one
to
the
other
for
we
loved
each
other
the
suppers
i
had
given
at
my
house
had
set
me
perfectly
at
liberty
and
the
superintendent
could
do
nothing
to
thwart
our
love
though
he
was
informed
of
it
so
well
are
the
spies
of
turin
organized
divine
providence
made
use
of
me
as
its
instrument
in
making
fortune
it
may
be
said
that
providence
might
have
chosen
a
more
moral
method
but
are
we
to
presume
to
limit
the
paths
of
providence
to
the
narrow
circle
of
our
prejudices
and
conventions
it
has
its
own
ways
which
often
appear
dark
to
us
because
of
our
ignorance
at
all
events
if
i
am
able
to
continue
these
memoirs
for
six
or
seven
years
more
the
reader
will
see
that
agatha
shewed
herself
grateful
but
to
return
to
our
subject
the
happiness
we
enjoyed
by
day
and
night
was
so
great
agatha
was
so
affectionate
and
i
so
amorous
that
we
should
certainly
have
remained
united
for
some
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
event
i
am
about
to
relate
it
made
me
leave
turin
much
sooner
than
i
had
intended
for
i
had
not
purposed
to
visit
the
wonderful
spanish
countess
at
milan
till
lent
the
husband
of
the
spanish
lady
had
finished
his
business
and
left
turin
thanking
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
quit
the
town
for
i
paid
divers
small
debts
he
had
incurred
and
gave
him
the
wherewithal
for
his
journey
often
is
vice
thus
found
allied
to
virtue
or
masking
in
virtue
guise
but
what
matter
i
allowed
myself
to
be
taken
in
and
did
not
wish
to
be
disabused
i
do
not
seek
to
conceal
my
faults
i
have
always
led
a
profligate
life
and
have
not
always
been
very
delicate
in
the
choice
of
means
to
gratify
my
passions
but
even
amidst
my
vices
i
was
always
a
passionate
lover
of
virtue
benevolence
especially
has
always
had
a
great
charm
for
me
and
i
have
never
failed
to
exercise
it
unless
when
restrained
by
the
desire
of
vengeance
a
vice
which
has
always
had
a
controlling
influence
on
my
actions
lord
percy
as
i
have
remarked
was
deeply
in
love
with
my
agatha
he
followed
her
about
everywhere
was
present
at
all
the
rehearsals
waited
for
her
at
the
wings
and
called
on
her
every
day
although
her
landlady
a
duenna
of
the
pacienza
school
would
never
let
her
see
him
alone
the
principal
methods
of
seduction
rich
presents
had
not
been
spared
but
agatha
persistently
refused
them
all
and
forbade
her
duenna
to
take
anything
from
the
young
nobleman
agatha
had
no
liking
for
him
and
kept
me
well
informed
of
all
his
actions
and
we
used
to
laugh
at
him
together
i
knew
that
i
possessed
her
heart
and
consequently
lord
percy
attempts
neither
made
me
angry
or
jealous
nay
they
flattered
my
for
his
slighted
love
made
my
own
happiness
stand
out
in
greater
relief
everybody
knew
that
agatha
remained
faithful
to
me
and
at
last
lord
percy
was
so
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
attempt
that
he
resolved
on
making
a
friend
of
me
and
winning
me
over
to
his
interests
with
the
true
englishman
boldness
and
coolness
he
came
to
me
one
morning
and
asked
me
to
give
him
breakfast
i
welcomed
him
in
the
french
manner
that
is
with
combined
cordiality
and
politeness
and
he
was
soon
completely
at
his
ease
with
insular
directness
he
went
straight
to
the
point
at
the
first
interview
declared
his
love
for
agatha
and
proposed
an
exchange
which
amused
but
did
not
offend
me
as
i
knew
that
such
bargains
were
common
in
england
i
know
said
he
that
you
are
in
love
with
redegonde
and
have
long
tried
vainly
to
obtain
her
now
i
am
willing
to
exchange
her
for
agatha
and
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
sum
of
money
you
want
over
and
above
you
are
very
good
my
dear
lord
but
to
determine
the
excess
of
value
would
require
a
good
mathematician
redegonde
is
all
very
well
and
inspires
me
with
curiosity
but
what
is
she
compared
to
agatha
i
know
i
know
and
i
therefore
offer
you
any
sum
you
like
to
mention
percy
was
very
rich
and
very
passionate
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
named
thousand
guineas
as
overplus
or
rather
as
exchange
for
i
did
not
care
for
redegonde
he
would
have
said
done
however
i
did
not
and
i
am
glad
of
it
even
now
when
a
hundred
thousand
francs
would
be
a
fortune
to
me
i
never
repent
of
my
delicacy
after
we
had
breakfasted
merrily
together
i
told
him
that
i
liked
him
well
but
that
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
well
to
ascertain
whether
the
two
commodities
would
consent
to
change
masters
i
am
sure
of
redegonde
consent
said
lord
percy
but
i
am
not
at
all
sure
of
agatha
said
i
why
not
i
have
very
strong
grounds
for
supposing
that
she
would
not
consent
to
the
arrangement
what
reasons
have
you
for
the
contrary
opinion
she
will
shew
her
sense
but
she
loves
me
well
redegonde
loves
me
i
dare
say
but
does
she
love
me
i
am
sure
i
do
know
but
she
will
love
you
have
you
consulted
her
upon
the
point
no
but
it
is
all
the
same
what
i
want
to
know
now
is
whether
you
approve
of
my
plan
and
how
much
you
want
for
the
exchange
for
your
agatha
is
worth
much
more
than
my
redegonde
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
do
my
mistress
justice
as
for
the
money
question
we
will
speak
of
that
later
in
the
first
place
i
will
take
agatha
opinion
and
will
let
you
know
the
result
morning
the
plan
amused
me
and
though
i
was
passionately
attached
to
agatha
i
knew
my
inconstant
nature
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
another
woman
may
be
not
so
fair
as
she
would
soon
make
me
forget
her
i
therefore
resolved
to
push
the
matter
through
if
i
could
do
so
in
a
manner
that
would
be
advantageous
for
her
what
surprised
me
was
that
the
young
nobleman
had
gained
possession
of
redegonde
whose
mother
appeared
so
intractable
but
i
knew
what
an
influence
caprice
has
on
woman
and
this
explained
the
enigma
agatha
came
to
supper
as
usual
and
laughed
heartily
when
i
told
her
of
lord
percy
proposal
tell
me
said
i
if
you
would
agree
to
the
change
i
will
do
just
as
you
like
said
she
and
if
the
money
he
offers
be
acceptable
to
you
i
advise
you
to
close
with
him
i
could
see
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
she
was
jesting
but
her
reply
did
not
please
me
i
should
have
liked
to
have
my
vanity
flattered
by
a
peremptory
refusal
and
consequently
i
felt
angry
my
face
grew
grave
and
agatha
became
melancholy
we
will
see
said
i
how
it
all
ends
next
day
i
went
to
breakfast
with
the
englishman
and
told
him
agatha
was
willing
but
that
i
must
first
hear
what
redegonde
had
to
say
quite
right
he
observed
i
should
require
to
know
how
we
are
to
live
together
the
four
of
us
had
better
go
masked
to
the
first
ball
at
the
carignan
theatre
we
will
sup
at
a
house
which
belongs
to
me
and
there
the
bargain
can
be
struck
the
party
took
place
according
to
agreement
and
at
the
given
signal
we
all
left
the
my
lord
carriage
was
in
waiting
and
we
all
drove
away
and
got
down
at
a
house
i
seemed
to
know
we
entered
the
hall
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
corticelli
this
roused
my
choler
and
taking
percy
aside
i
told
him
that
such
a
trick
was
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
he
laughed
and
said
he
thought
i
should
like
her
to
be
thrown
in
and
that
two
pretty
women
were
surely
worth
as
much
as
agatha
this
amusing
answer
made
me
less
angry
but
calling
him
a
madman
i
took
agatha
by
the
arm
and
went
out
without
staying
for
any
explanations
i
would
not
make
use
of
his
carriage
and
instead
of
returning
to
the
ball
we
went
home
in
and
spent
a
delicious
night
in
each
arms
