the

rintrah
roars
and
shakes
his
fires
in
the
burden
air
hungry
clouds
swag
on
the
deep
once
meek
and
in
a
perilous
path
the
just
man
kept
his
course
along
the
vale
of
death
roses
are
planted
where
thorns
grow
and
on
the
barren
heath
sing
the
honey
bees
then
the
perilous
path
was
planted
and
a
river
and
a
spring
on
every
cliff
and
tomb
and
on
the
bleached
bones
red
clay
brought
forth
till
the
villain
left
the
paths
of
ease
to
walk
in
perilous
paths
and
drive
the
just
man
into
barren
climes
now
the
sneaking
serpent
walks
in
mild
humility
and
the
just
man
rages
in
the
wilds
where
lions
roam
rintrah
roars
and
shakes
his
fires
in
the
burden
air
hungry
clouds
swag
on
the
deep
as
a
new
heaven
is
begun
and
it
is
now
years
since
its
advent
the
eternal
hell
revives
and
lo
swedenborg
is
the
angel
sitting
at
the
tomb
his
writings
are
the
linen
clothes
folded
up
now
is

chap
without
contraries
is
no
progression
attraction
and
repulsion
reason
and
energy
love
and
hate
are
necessary
to
human
existence
from
these
contraries
spring
what
the
religious
call
good
and
evil
good
is
the
passive
that
obeys
reason
evil
is
the
active
springing
from
energy
good
is
heaven
evil
is
hell
the
voice
of
the
devil
all
bibles
or
sacred
codes
have
been
the
cause
of
the
following
errors
that
man
has
two
real
existing
principles
a
body
and
a
soul
that
energy
called
evil
is
alone
from
the
body
and
that
reason
called
good
is
alone
from
the
soul
that
god
will
torment
man
in
eternity
for
following
his
energies
but
the
following
contraries
to
these
are
true
man
has
no
body
distinct
from
his
soul
for
that
called
body
is
a
portion
of
soul
discerned
by
the
five
senses
the
chief
inlets
of
soul
in
this
age
energy
is
the
only
life
and
is
from
the
body
and
reason
is
the
bound
or
outward
circumference
of
energy
energy
is
eternal
delight
those
who
restrain
desire
do
so
because
theirs
is
weak
enough
to
be
restrained
and
the
restrainer
or
reason
usurps
its
place
and
governs
the
unwilling
and
being
restrained
it
by
degrees
becomes
passive
till
it
is
only
the
shadow
of
desire
the
history
of
this
is
written
in
paradise
lost
and
the
governor
or
reason
is
called
messiah
and
the
original
archangel
or
possessor
of
the
command
of
the
heavenly
host
is
called
the
devil
or
satan
and
his
children
are
called
sin
and
death
but
in
the
book
of
job
milton
messiah
is
called
satan
for
this
history
has
been
adopted
by
both
parties
it
indeed
appeared
to
reason
as
if
desire
was
cast
out
but
the
devil
account
is
that
the
messiah
fell
and
formed
a
heaven
of
what
he
stole
from
the
abyss
this
is
shown
in
the
gospel
where
he
prays
to
the
father
to
send
the
comforter
or
desire
that
reason
may
have
ideas
to
build
on
the
jehovah
of
the
bible
being
no
other
than
he
who
dwells
in
flaming
fire
know
that
after
christ
death
he
became
jehovah
but
in
milton
the
father
is
destiny
the
son
a
ratio
of
the
five
senses
and
the
holy
ghost
vacuum
the
reason
milton
wrote
in
fetters
when
he
wrote
of
angels
and
god
and
at
liberty
when
of
devils
and
hell
is
because
he
was
a
true
poet
and
of
the
devil
party
without
knowing
it
a
memorable
fancy
as
i
was
walking
among
the
fires
of
hell
delighted
with
the
enjoyments
of
genius
which
to
angels
look
like
torment
and
insanity
i
collected
some
of
their
proverbs
thinking
that
as
the
sayings
used
in
a
nation
mark
its
character
so
the
proverbs
of
hell
show
the
nature
of
infernal
wisdom
better
than
any
description
of
buildings
or
garments
when
i
came
home
on
the
abyss
of
the
five
senses
where
a
steep
frowns
over
the
present
world
i
saw
a
mighty
devil
folded
in
black
clouds
hovering
on
the
sides
of
the
rock
with
corroding
fires
he
wrote
the
following
sentence
now
perceived
by
the
minds
of
men
and
read
by
them
on
earth
how
do
you
know
but
every
bird
that
cuts
the
airy
way
is
an
immense
world

the
crooked

of

sooner

man

not
nature
is
barren
truth
can
never
be
told
so
as
to
be
understood
and
not
to
be
believed
enough
or
too
much
the
ancient
poets
animated
all
sensible
objects
with
gods
or
geniuses
calling
them
by
the
names
and
adorning
them
with
properties
of
woods
rivers
mountains
lakes
cities
nations
and
whatever
their
enlarged
and
numerous
senses
could
perceive
and
particularly
they
studied
the
genius
of
each
city
and
country
placing
it
under
its
mental
deity
till
a
system
was
formed
which
some
took
advantage
of
and
enslaved
the
vulgar
by
attempting
to
realize
or
abstract
the
mental
deities
from
their
objects
thus
began
priesthood
choosing
forms
of
worship
from
poetic
tales
and
at
length
they
pronounced
that
the
gods
had
ordered
such
things
thus
men
forgot
that
all
deities
reside
in
the
human
breast
a
memorable
fancy
the
prophets
isaiah
and
ezekiel
dined
with
me
and
i
asked
them
how
they
dared
so
roundly
to
assert
that
god
spoke
to
them
and
whether
they
did
not
think
at
the
time
that
they
would
be
misunderstood
and
so
be
the
cause
of
imposition
isaiah
answered
i
saw
no
god
nor
heard
any
in
a
finite
organical
perception
but
my
senses
discovered
the
infinite
in
everything
and
as
i
was
then
persuaded
and
remained
confirmed
that
the
voice
of
honest
indignation
is
the
voice
of
god
i
cared
not
for
consequences
but
wrote
then
i
asked
does
a
firm
persuasion
that
a
thing
is
so
make
it
so
he
replied
all
poets
believe
that
it
does
and
in
ages
of
imagination
this
firm
persuasion
removed
mountains
but
many
are
not
capable
of
a
firm
persuasion
of
anything
then
ezekiel
said
the
philosophy
of
the
east
taught
the
first
principles
of
human
perception
some
nations
held
one
principle
for
the
origin
and
some
another
we
of
israel
taught
that
the
poetic
genius
as
you
now
call
it
was
the
first
principle
and
all
the
others
merely
derivative
which
was
the
cause
of
our
despising
the
priests
and
philosophers
of
other
countries
and
prophesying
that
all
gods
would
at
last
be
proved
to
originate
in
ours
and
to
be
the
tributaries
of
the
poetic
genius
it
was
this
that
our
great
poet
king
david
desired
so
fervently
and
invokes
so
pathetically
saying
by
this
he
conquers
enemies
and
governs
kingdoms
and
we
so
loved
our
god
that
we
cursed
in
his
name
all
the
deities
of
surrounding
nations
and
asserted
that
they
had
rebelled
from
these
opinions
the
vulgar
came
to
think
that
all
nations
would
at
last
be
subject
to
the
jews
this
said
he
like
all
firm
persuasions
is
come
to
pass
for
all
nations
believe
the
jews
code
and
worship
the
jews
god
and
what
greater
subjection
can
be
i
heard
this
with
some
wonder
and
must
confess
my
own
conviction
after
dinner
i
asked
isaiah
to
favour
the
world
with
his
lost
works
he
said
none
of
equal
value
was
lost
ezekiel
said
the
same
of
his
i
also
asked
isaiah
what
made
him
go
naked
and
barefoot
three
years
he
answered
the
same
that
made
our
friend
diogenes
the
grecian
i
then
asked
ezekiel
why
he
ate
dung
and
lay
so
long
on
his
right
and
left
side
he
answered
the
desire
of
raising
other
men
into
a
perception
of
the
infinite
this
the
north
american
tribes
practise
and
is
he
honest
who
resists
his
genius
or
conscience
only
for
the
sake
of
present
ease
or
gratification
the
ancient
tradition
that
the
world
will
be
consumed
in
fire
at
the
end
of
six
thousand
years
is
true
as
i
have
heard
from
hell
for
the
cherub
with
his
flaming
sword
is
hereby
commanded
to
leave
his
guard
at
the
tree
of
life
and
when
he
does
the
whole
creation
will
be
consumed
and
appear
infinite
and
holy
whereas
it
now
appears
finite
and
corrupt
this
will
come
to
pass
by
an
improvement
of
sensual
enjoyment
but
first
the
notion
that
man
has
a
body
distinct
from
his
soul
is
to
be
expunged
this
i
shall
do
by
printing
in
the
infernal
method
by
corrosives
which
in
hell
are
salutary
and
medicinal
melting
apparent
surfaces
away
and
displaying
the
infinite
which
was
hid
if
the
doors
of
perception
were
cleansed
everything
would
appear
to
man
as
it
is
infinite
for
man
has
closed
himself
up
till
he
sees
all
things
through
narrow
chinks
of
his
cavern
a
memorable
fancy
i
was
in
a
in
hell
and
saw
the
method
in
which
knowledge
is
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
in
the
first
chamber
was
a
clearing
away
the
rubbish
from
a
cave
mouth
within
a
number
of
dragons
were
hollowing
the
cave
in
the
second
chamber
was
a
viper
folding
round
the
rock
and
the
cave
and
others
adorning
it
with
gold
silver
and
precious
stones
in
the
third
chamber
was
an
eagle
with
wings
and
feathers
of
air
he
caused
the
inside
of
the
cave
to
be
infinite
around
were
numbers
of
men
who
built
palaces
in
the
immense
cliffs
in
the
fourth
chamber
were
lions
of
flaming
fire
raging
around
and
melting
the
metals
into
living
fluids
in
the
fifth
chamber
were
unnamed
forms
which
cast
the
metals
into
the
expanse
there
they
were
received
by
men
who
occupied
the
sixth
chamber
and
took
the
forms
of
books
and
were
arranged
in
libraries
the
giants
who
formed
this
world
into
its
sensual
existence
and
now
seem
to
live
in
it
in
chains
are
in
truth
the
causes
of
its
life
and
the
sources
of
all
activity
but
the
chains
are
the
cunning
of
weak
and
tame
minds
which
have
power
to
resist
energy
according
to
the
proverb
the
weak
in
courage
is
strong
in
cunning
thus
one
portion
of
being
is
the
prolific
the
other
the
devouring
to
the
devourer
it
seems
as
if
the
producer
was
in
his
chains
but
it
is
not
so
he
only
takes
portions
of
existence
and
fancies
that
the
whole
but
the
prolific
would
cease
to
be
prolific
unless
the
devourer
as
a
sea
received
the
excess
of
his
delights
some
will
say
is
not
god
alone
the
prolific
i
answer
god
only
acts
and
is
in
existing
beings
or
men
these
two
classes
of
men
are
always
upon
earth
and
they
should
be
enemies
whoever
tries
to
reconcile
them
seeks
to
destroy
existence
religion
is
an
endeavour
to
reconcile
the
two
jesus
christ
did
not
wish
to
unite
but
to
separate
them
as
in
the
parable
of
sheep
and
goats
and
he
says
i
came
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
messiah
or
satan
or
tempter
was
formerly
thought
to
be
one
of
the
antediluvians
who
are
our
energies
a
memorable
fancy
an
angel
came
to
me
and
said
o
pitiable
foolish
young
man
o
horrible
o
dreadful
state
consider
the
hot
burning
dungeon
thou
art
preparing
for
thyself
to
all
eternity
to
which
thou
art
going
in
such
career
i
said
perhaps
you
will
be
willing
to
show
me
my
eternal
lot
and
we
will
contemplate
together
upon
it
and
see
whether
your
lot
or
mine
is
most
desirable
so
he
took
me
through
a
stable
and
through
a
church
and
down
into
the
church
vault
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
mill
through
the
mill
we
went
and
came
to
a
cave
down
the
winding
cavern
we
groped
our
tedious
way
till
a
void
boundless
as
a
nether
sky
appeared
beneath
us
and
we
held
by
the
roots
of
trees
and
hung
over
this
immensity
but
i
said
if
you
please
we
will
commit
ourselves
to
this
void
and
see
whether
providence
is
here
also
if
you
will
not
i
will
but
he
answered
do
not
presume
o
young
man
but
as
we
here
remain
behold
thy
lot
which
will
soon
appear
when
the
darkness
passes
away
so
i
remained
with
him
sitting
in
the
twisted
root
of
an
oak
he
was
suspended
in
a
fungus
which
hung
with
the
head
downward
into
the
deep
by
degrees
we
beheld
the
infinite
abyss
fiery
as
the
smoke
of
a
burning
city
beneath
us
at
an
immense
distance
was
the
sun
black
but
shining
round
it
were
fiery
tracks
on
which
revolved
vast
spiders
crawling
after
their
prey
which
flew
or
rather
swum
in
the
infinite
deep
in
the
most
terrific
shapes
of
animals
sprung
from
corruption
and
the
air
was
full
of
them
and
seemed
composed
of
them
these
are
devils
and
are
called
powers
of
the
air
i
now
asked
my
companion
which
was
my
eternal
lot
he
said
between
the
black
and
white
spiders
but
now
from
between
the
black
and
white
spiders
a
cloud
and
fire
burst
and
rolled
through
the
deep
blackening
all
beneath
so
that
the
nether
deep
grew
black
as
a
sea
and
rolled
with
a
terrible
noise
beneath
us
was
nothing
now
to
be
seen
but
a
black
tempest
till
looking
east
between
the
clouds
and
the
waves
we
saw
a
cataract
of
blood
mixed
with
fire
and
not
many
stones
throw
from
us
appeared
and
sunk
again
the
scaly
fold
of
a
monstrous
serpent
at
last
to
the
east
distant
about
three
degrees
appeared
a
fiery
crest
above
the
waves
slowly
it
reared
like
a
ridge
of
golden
rocks
till
we
discovered
two
globes
of
crimson
fire
from
which
the
sea
fled
away
in
clouds
of
smoke
and
now
we
saw
it
was
the
head
of
leviathan
his
forehead
was
divided
into
streaks
of
green
and
purple
like
those
on
a
tiger
forehead
soon
we
saw
his
mouth
and
red
gills
hang
just
above
the
raging
foam
tinging
the
black
deeps
with
beams
of
blood
advancing
toward
us
with
all
the
fury
of
a
spiritual
existence
my
friend
the
angel
climbed
up
from
his
station
into
the
mill
i
remained
alone
and
then
this
appearance
was
no
more
but
i
found
myself
sitting
on
a
pleasant
bank
beside
a
river
by
moonlight
hearing
a
harper
who
sung
to
the
harp
and
his
theme
was
the
man
who
never
alters
his
opinion
is
like
standing
water
and
breeds
reptiles
of
the
mind
but
i
arose
and
sought
for
the
mill
and
there
i
found
my
angel
who
surprised
asked
me
how
i
escaped
i
answered
all
that
we
saw
was
owing
to
your
metaphysics
for
when
you
ran
away
i
found
myself
on
a
bank
by
moonlight
hearing
a
harper
but
now
we
have
seen
my
eternal
lot
shall
i
show
you
yours
he
laughed
at
my
proposal
but
i
by
force
suddenly
caught
him
in
my
arms
and
flew
westerly
through
the
night
till
we
were
elevated
above
the
earth
shadow
then
i
flung
myself
with
him
directly
into
the
body
of
the
sun
here
i
clothed
myself
in
white
and
taking
in
my
hand
swedenborg
volumes
sunk
from
the
glorious
clime
and
passed
all
the
planets
till
we
came
to
saturn
here
i
stayed
to
rest
and
then
leaped
into
the
void
between
saturn
and
the
fixed
stars
here
said
i
is
your
lot
in
this
space
if
space
it
may
be
called
soon
we
saw
the
stable
and
the
church
and
i
took
him
to
the
altar
and
opened
the
bible
and
lo
it
was
a
deep
pit
into
which
i
descended
driving
the
angel
before
me
soon
we
saw
seven
houses
of
brick
one
we
entered
in
it
were
a
number
of
monkeys
baboons
and
all
of
that
species
chained
by
the
middle
grinning
and
snatching
at
one
another
but
withheld
by
the
shortness
of
their
chains
however
i
saw
that
they
sometimes
grew
numerous
and
then
the
weak
were
caught
by
the
strong
and
with
a
grinning
aspect
first
coupled
with
and
then
devoured
by
plucking
off
first
one
limb
and
then
another
till
the
body
was
left
a
helpless
trunk
this
after
grinning
and
kissing
it
with
seeming
fondness
they
devoured
too
and
here
and
there
i
saw
one
savourily
picking
the
flesh
off
his
own
tail
as
the
stench
terribly
annoyed
us
both
we
went
into
the
mill
and
i
in
my
hand
brought
the
skeleton
of
a
body
which
in
the
mill
was
aristotle
analytics
so
the
angel
said
thy
phantasy
has
imposed
upon
me
and
thou
oughtest
to
be
ashamed
i
answered
we
impose
on
one
another
and
it
is
but
lost
time
to
converse
with
you
whose
works
are
only
analytics
i
have
always
found
that
angels
have
the
vanity
to
speak
of
themselves
as
the
only
wise
this
they
do
with
a
confident
insolence
sprouting
from
systematic
reasoning
thus
swedenborg
boasts
that
what
he
writes
is
new
though
it
is
only
the
contents
or
index
of
already
published
books
a
man
carried
a
monkey
about
for
a
show
and
because
he
was
a
little
wiser
than
the
monkey
grew
vain
and
conceived
himself
as
much
wiser
than
seven
men
it
is
so
with
swedenborg
he
shows
the
folly
of
churches
and
exposes
hypocrites
till
he
imagines
that
all
are
religious
and
himself
the
single
one
on
earth
that
ever
broke
a
net
now
hear
a
plain
fact
swedenborg
has
not
written
one
new
truth
now
hear
another
he
has
written
all
the
old
falsehoods
and
now
hear
the
reason
he
conversed
with
angels
who
are
all
religious
and
conversed
not
with
devils
who
all
hate
religion
for
he
was
incapable
through
his
conceited
notions
thus
swedenborg
writings
are
a
recapitulation
of
all
superficial
opinions
and
an
analysis
of
the
more
sublime
but
no
further
have
now
another
plain
fact
any
man
of
mechanical
talents
may
from
the
writings
of
paracelsus
or
jacob
behmen
produce
ten
thousand
volumes
of
equal
value
with
swedenborg
and
from
those
of
dante
or
shakespeare
an
infinite
number
but
when
he
has
done
this
let
him
not
say
that
he
knows
better
than
his
master
for
he
only
holds
a
candle
in
sunshine
a
memorable
fancy
once
i
saw
a
devil
in
a
flame
of
fire
who
arose
before
an
angel
that
sat
on
a
cloud
and
the
devil
uttered
these
words
the
worship
of
god
is
honouring
his
gifts
in
other
men
each
according
to
his
genius
and
loving
the
greatest
men
best
those
who
envy
or
calumniate
great
men
hate
god
for
there
is
no
other
god
the
angel
hearing
this
became
almost
blue
but
mastering
himself
he
grew
yellow
and
at
last
and
smiling
and
then
replied
thou
idolater
is
not
god
one
and
is
not
he
visible
in
jesus
christ
and
has
not
jesus
christ
given
his
sanction
to
the
law
of
ten
commandments
and
are
not
all
other
men
fools
sinners
and
nothings
the
devil
answered
bray
a
fool
in
a
mortar
with
wheat
yet
shall
not
his
folly
be
beaten
out
of
him
if
jesus
christ
is
the
greatest
man
you
ought
to
love
him
in
the
greatest
degree
now
hear
how
he
has
given
his
sanction
to
the
law
of
ten
commandments
did
he
not
mock
at
the
sabbath
and
so
mock
the
sabbath
god
murder
those
who
were
murdered
because
of
him
turn
away
the
law
from
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
steal
the
labour
of
others
to
support
him
bear
false
witness
when
he
omitted
making
a
defence
before
pilate
covet
when
he
prayed
for
his
disciples
and
when
he
bid
them
shake
off
the
dust
of
their
feet
against
such
as
refused
to
lodge
them
i
tell
you
no
virtue
can
exist
without
breaking
these
ten
commandments
jesus
was
all
virtue
and
acted
from
impulse
not
from
rules
when
he
had
so
spoken
i
beheld
the
angel
who
stretched
out
his
arms
embracing
the
flame
of
fire
and
he
was
consumed
and
arose
as
elijah
this
angel
who
is
now
become
a
devil
is
my
particular
friend
we
often
read
the
bible
together
in
its
infernal
or
diabolical
sense
which
the
world
shall
have
if
they
behave
well
i
have
also
the
bible
of
hell
which
the
world
shall
have
whether
they
will
or
no
one
law
for
the
lion

gloomy

promulgates

glancing
his
beamy
