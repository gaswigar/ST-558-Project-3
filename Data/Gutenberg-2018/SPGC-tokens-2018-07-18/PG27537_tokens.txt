can

without
you
when
a
woman
suddenly
came
in
sentimental
education
chapter
xi
a
dinner
and
a
duel
frederick
passed
the
whole
of
the
next
day
in
brooding
over
his
anger
and
humiliation
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
given
a
slap
in
the
face
to
cisy
as
for
the
maréchale
he
swore
not
to
see
her
again
others
as
could
be
easily
found
and
as
money
would
be
required
in
order
to
possess
these
women
he
would
speculate
on
the
bourse
with
the
of
his
farm
he
would
get
rich
he
would
crush
the
maréchale
and
everyone
else
with
his
luxury
when
the
evening
had
come
he
was
surprised
at
not
having
thought
of
madame
arnoux
so
much
the
better
what
the
good
of
it
two
days
after
at
eight
pellerin
came
to
pay
him
a
visit
he
began
by
expressing
his
admiration
of
the
furniture
and
talking
in
a
wheedling
tone
then
abruptly
you
were
at
the
races
on
sunday
yes
alas
thereupon
the
painter
decried
the
anatomy
of
english
horses
and
praised
the
horses
of
gericourt
and
the
horses
of
the
parthenon
rosanette
was
with
you
and
he
artfully
proceeded
to
speak
in
flattering
terms
about
her
frederick
freezing
manner
put
him
a
little
out
of
countenance
he
did
not
know
how
to
bring
about
the
question
of
her
portrait
his
first
idea
had
been
to
do
a
portrait
in
the
style
of
titian
but
gradually
the
varied
colouring
of
his
model
had
bewitched
him
he
had
gone
on
boldly
with
the
work
heaping
up
paste
on
paste
and
light
on
light
rosanette
in
the
beginning
was
enchanted
her
appointments
with
delmar
had
interrupted
the
sittings
and
left
pellerin
all
the
time
to
get
bedazzled
then
as
his
admiration
began
to
subside
he
asked
himself
whether
the
picture
might
not
be
on
a
larger
scale
he
had
gone
to
have
another
look
at
the
titians
realised
how
the
great
artist
had
filled
in
his
portraits
with
such
finish
and
saw
wherein
his
own
shortcomings
lay
and
then
he
began
to
go
over
the
outlines
again
in
the
most
simple
fashion
after
that
he
sought
by
scraping
them
off
to
lose
there
to
mingle
there
all
the
tones
of
the
head
and
those
of
the
background
and
the
face
had
assumed
consistency
and
the
shades
vigour
the
whole
work
had
a
look
of
greater
firmness
at
length
the
maréchale
came
back
again
she
even
indulged
in
some
hostile
criticisms
the
painter
naturally
persevered
in
his
own
course
after
getting
into
a
violent
passion
at
her
silliness
he
said
to
himself
that
after
all
perhaps
she
was
right
then
began
the
era
of
doubts
twinges
of
reflection
which
brought
about
cramps
in
the
stomach
insomnia
feverishness
and
disgust
with
himself
he
had
the
courage
to
make
some
retouchings
but
without
much
heart
and
with
a
feeling
that
his
work
was
bad
he
complained
merely
of
having
been
refused
a
place
in
the
salon
then
he
reproached
frederick
for
not
having
come
to
see
the
portrait
what
do
i
care
about
the
maréchale
such
an
expression
of
unconcern
emboldened
the
artist
would
you
believe
that
this
brute
has
no
interest
in
the
thing
any
longer
what
he
did
not
mention
was
that
he
had
asked
her
for
a
thousand
crowns
now
the
maréchale
did
not
give
herself
much
bother
about
ascertaining
who
was
going
to
pay
and
preferring
to
screw
money
out
of
arnoux
for
things
of
a
more
urgent
character
had
not
even
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
well
and
arnoux
she
had
thrown
it
over
on
him
the
wished
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
portrait
he
maintains
that
it
belongs
to
rosanette
in
fact
it
is
hers
how
is
that
is
she
that
sent
me
to
you
was
pellerin
answer
if
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
excellence
of
his
work
he
would
not
have
dreamed
perhaps
of
making
capital
out
of
it
but
a
sum
and
a
big
sum
would
be
an
effective
reply
to
the
critics
and
would
strengthen
his
own
position
finally
to
get
rid
of
his
importunities
frederick
courteously
enquired
his
terms
the
extravagant
figure
named
by
pellerin
quite
took
away
his
breath
and
he
replied
oh
no
no
you
however
are
her
lover
is
you
gave
me
the
order
excuse
me
i
was
only
an
intermediate
agent
but
i
ca
remain
with
this
on
my
hands
the
artist
lost
his
temper
ha
i
did
imagine
you
were
so
covetous
nor
i
that
you
were
so
stingy
i
wish
you
good
morning
he
had
just
gone
out
when
sénécal
made
his
appearance
frederick
was
moving
about
restlessly
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
what
the
matter
sénécal
told
his
story
on
saturday
at
nine
madame
arnoux
got
a
letter
which
summoned
her
back
to
paris
as
there
happened
to
be
nobody
in
the
place
at
the
time
to
go
to
creil
for
a
vehicle
she
asked
me
to
go
there
myself
i
refused
for
this
was
no
part
of
my
duties
she
left
and
came
back
on
sunday
evening
yesterday
morning
arnoux
came
down
to
the
works
the
girl
from
bordeaux
made
a
complaint
to
him
i
do
know
what
passed
between
them
but
he
took
off
before
everyone
the
fine
i
had
imposed
on
her
some
sharp
words
passed
between
us
in
short
he
closed
accounts
with
me
and
here
i
am
then
with
a
pause
between
every
word
furthermore
i
am
not
sorry
i
have
done
my
duty
no
matter
you
were
the
cause
of
it
how
exclaimed
frederick
alarmed
lest
sénécal
might
have
guessed
his
secret
sénécal
had
not
however
guessed
anything
about
it
for
he
replied
that
is
to
say
but
for
you
i
might
have
done
better
frederick
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
remorse
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
now
sénécal
wanted
some
employment
a
situation
that
is
an
easy
thing
for
you
to
manage
you
know
many
people
of
good
position
monsieur
dambreuse
amongst
others
at
least
so
deslauriers
told
me
this
allusion
to
deslauriers
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
his
friend
he
scarcely
cared
to
call
on
the
dambreuses
again
after
his
undesirable
meeting
with
them
in
the
champ
de
mars
i
am
not
on
sufficiently
intimate
terms
with
them
to
recommend
anyone
the
democrat
endured
this
refusal
stoically
and
after
a
silence
all
this
i
am
sure
is
due
to
the
girl
from
bordeaux
and
to
your
madame
arnoux
this
your
had
the
effect
of
wiping
out
of
frederick
heart
the
slight
modicum
of
regard
he
entertained
for
sénécal
nevertheless
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
key
of
his
escritoire
through
delicacy
sénécal
anticipated
him
thanks
then
forgetting
his
own
troubles
he
talked
about
the
affairs
of
the
nation
the
crosses
of
the
legion
of
honour
wasted
at
the
royal
fête
the
question
of
a
change
of
ministry
the
drouillard
case
and
the
bénier
case
scandals
of
the
day
declaimed
against
the
middle
class
and
predicted
a
revolution
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
a
japanese
dagger
hanging
on
the
wall
he
took
hold
of
it
then
he
flung
it
on
the
sofa
with
an
air
of
disgust
come
then
i
must
go
to
nôtre
dame
de
lorette
hold
on
why
the
anniversary
service
for
godefroy
cavaignac
is
taking
place
there
he
died
at
work
that
man
but
all
is
not
over
who
knows
and
sénécal
with
a
show
of
fortitude
put
out
his
hand
perhaps
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
this
repeated
several
times
his
knitted
brows
as
he
gazed
at
the
dagger
his
resignation
and
the
solemnity
of
his
manner
above
all
plunged
frederick
into
a
thoughtful
mood
but
very
soon
he
ceased
to
think
about
sénécal
during
the
same
week
his
notary
at
havre
sent
him
the
sum
realised
by
the
sale
of
his
farm
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
he
divided
it
into
two
portions
invested
the
first
half
in
the
funds
and
brought
the
second
half
to
a
to
take
his
chance
of
making
money
by
it
on
the
bourse
he
dined
at
fashionable
taverns
went
to
the
theatres
and
was
trying
to
amuse
himself
as
best
he
could
when
hussonnet
addressed
a
letter
to
him
announcing
in
a
gay
fashion
that
the
maréchale
had
got
rid
of
cisy
the
very
day
after
the
races
frederick
was
delighted
at
this
intelligence
without
taking
the
trouble
to
ascertain
what
the
bohemian
motive
was
in
giving
him
the
information
it
so
happened
that
he
met
cisy
three
days
later
that
aristocratic
young
gentleman
kept
his
counteance
and
even
invited
frederick
to
dine
on
the
following
wednesday
on
the
morning
of
that
day
the
latter
received
a
notification
from
a
in
which
charles
jean
baptiste
oudry
apprised
him
that
by
the
terms
of
a
legal
judgment
he
had
become
the
purchaser
of
a
property
situated
at
belleville
belonging
to
jacques
arnoux
and
that
he
was
ready
to
pay
the
two
hundred
and
thousand
for
which
it
had
been
sold
but
as
it
appeared
by
the
same
decree
that
the
amount
of
the
mortgages
with
which
the
estate
was
encumbered
exceeded
the
frederick
claim
would
in
consequence
be
completely
forfeited
the
entire
mischief
arose
from
not
having
renewed
the
registration
of
the
mortgage
within
the
proper
time
arnoux
had
undertaken
to
attend
to
this
matter
formally
himself
and
had
then
forgotten
all
about
it
frederick
got
into
a
rage
with
him
for
this
and
when
the
young
anger
had
passed
off
well
afterwards
what
if
this
can
save
him
so
much
the
better
it
wo
kill
me
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
but
while
moving
about
his
papers
on
the
table
he
came
across
hussonnet
letter
and
noticed
the
postscript
which
had
not
at
first
attracted
his
attention
the
bohemian
wanted
just
five
thousand
francs
to
give
the
journal
a
start
ah
this
fellow
is
worrying
me
to
death
and
he
sent
a
curt
answer
unceremoniously
refusing
the
application
after
that
he
dressed
himself
to
go
to
the
maison
cisy
introduced
his
guests
beginning
with
the
most
respectable
of
them
a
big
gentleman
the
marquis
gilbert
des
aulnays
my
godfather
monsieur
anselme
de
forchambeaux
he
said
next
a
thin
young
man
already
bald
then
pointing
towards
a
man
of
forty
joseph
boffreu
my
cousin
and
here
is
my
old
tutor
monsieur
vezou
a
person
who
seemed
a
mixture
of
a
ploughman
and
a
seminarist
with
large
whiskers
and
a
long
fastened
at
the
end
by
a
single
button
so
that
it
fell
over
his
chest
like
a
shawl
cisy
was
expecting
some
one
else
the
baron
de
comaing
who
might
perhaps
come
but
it
was
not
certain
he
left
the
room
every
minute
and
appeared
to
be
in
a
restless
frame
of
mind
finally
at
eight
they
proceeded
towards
an
apartment
splendidly
lighted
up
and
much
more
spacious
than
the
number
of
guests
required
cisy
had
selected
it
for
the
special
purpose
of
display
a
vermilion
épergne
laden
with
flowers
and
fruit
occupied
the
centre
of
the
table
which
was
covered
with
silver
dishes
after
the
old
french
fashion
glass
bowls
full
of
salt
meats
and
spices
formed
a
border
all
around
it
jars
of
iced
red
wine
stood
at
regular
distances
from
each
other
five
glasses
of
different
sizes
were
ranged
before
each
plate
with
things
of
which
the
use
could
not
be
divined
a
thousand
dinner
utensils
of
an
ingenious
description
for
the
first
course
alone
there
was
a
sturgeon
jowl
moistened
with
champagne
a
yorkshire
ham
with
tokay
thrushes
with
sauce
roast
quail
a
béchamel
a
stew
of
partridges
and
at
the
two
ends
of
all
this
fringes
of
potatoes
which
were
mingled
with
truffles
the
apartment
was
illuminated
by
a
lustre
and
some
girandoles
and
it
was
hung
with
red
damask
curtains
four
in
black
coats
stood
behind
the
armchairs
which
were
upholstered
in
morocco
at
this
sight
the
guests
uttered
an
exclamation
the
tutor
more
emphatically
than
the
rest
upon
my
word
our
host
has
indulged
in
a
foolishly
lavish
display
of
luxury
it
is
too
beautiful
is
that
so
said
the
vicomte
de
cisy
come
on
then
and
as
they
were
swallowing
the
first
spoonful
well
my
dear
old
friend
aulnays
have
you
been
to
the
to
see
et
you
know
well
that
i
have
no
time
to
go
replied
the
marquis
his
mornings
were
taken
up
with
a
course
of
arboriculture
his
evenings
were
spent
at
the
agricultural
club
and
all
his
afternoons
were
occupied
by
a
study
of
the
implements
of
husbandry
in
manufactories
as
he
resided
at
saintonge
for
three
fourths
of
the
year
he
took
advantage
of
his
visits
to
the
capital
to
get
fresh
information
and
his
hat
which
lay
on
a
was
crammed
with
pamphlets
but
cisy
observing
that
de
forchambeaux
refused
to
take
wine
go
on
damn
it
drink
you
not
in
good
form
for
your
last
meal
at
this
remark
all
bowed
and
congratulated
him
and
the
young
lady
said
the
tutor
is
charming
i
sure
faith
she
is
exclaimed
cisy
no
matter
he
is
making
a
mistake
marriage
is
such
a
stupid
thing
you
talk
in
a
thoughtless
fashion
my
friend
returned
des
aulnays
while
tears
began
to
gather
in
his
eyes
at
the
recollection
of
his
own
dead
wife
and
forchambeaux
repeated
several
times
in
succession
it
will
be
your
own
case
it
will
be
your
own
case
cisy
protested
he
preferred
to
enjoy
himself
to
live
in
the
style
of
the
regency
days
he
wanted
to
learn
the
in
order
to
visit
the
thieves
taverns
of
the
city
like
rodolphe
in
the
of
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
dirty
clay
pipe
abused
the
servants
and
drank
a
great
quantity
then
in
order
to
create
a
good
impression
about
himself
he
disparaged
all
the
dishes
he
even
sent
away
the
truffles
and
the
tutor
who
was
exceedingly
fond
of
them
said
through
servility
these
are
not
as
good
as
your
grandmother
eggs
then
he
began
to
chat
with
the
person
sitting
next
to
him
the
agriculturist
who
found
many
advantages
from
his
sojourn
in
the
country
if
it
were
only
to
be
able
to
bring
up
his
daughters
with
simple
tastes
the
tutor
approved
of
his
ideas
and
toadied
to
him
supposing
that
this
gentleman
possessed
influence
over
his
former
pupil
whose
man
of
business
he
was
anxious
to
become
frederick
had
come
there
filled
with
hostility
to
cisy
but
the
young
aristocrat
idiocy
had
disarmed
him
however
as
the
other
gestures
face
and
entire
person
brought
back
to
his
recollection
the
dinner
at
the
café
anglais
he
got
more
and
more
irritated
and
he
lent
his
ears
to
the
complimentary
remarks
made
in
a
low
tone
by
joseph
the
cousin
a
fine
young
fellow
without
any
money
who
was
a
lover
of
the
chase
and
a
university
prizeman
cisy
for
the
sake
of
a
laugh
called
him
a
catcher
a
several
times
then
suddenly
ha
here
comes
the
baron
at
that
moment
there
entered
a
jovial
blade
of
thirty
with
somewhat
features
and
active
limbs
wearing
his
hat
over
his
ear
and
displaying
a
flower
in
his
he
was
the
vicomte
ideal
the
young
aristocrat
was
delighted
at
having
him
there
and
stimulated
by
his
presence
he
even
attempted
a
pun
for
he
said
as
they
passed
a
there
the
best
of
la
bruyère
characters
b
after
that
he
put
a
heap
of
questions
to
de
comaing
about
persons
unknown
to
society
then
as
if
an
idea
had
suddenly
seized
him
tell
me
pray
have
you
thought
about
me
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
not
old
enough
my
little
man
it
is
impossible
cisy
had
begged
of
the
baron
to
get
him
admitted
into
his
club
but
the
other
having
no
doubt
taken
pity
on
his
vanity
ha
i
was
forgetting
a
thousand
congratulations
on
having
won
your
bet
my
dear
fellow
what
bet
the
bet
you
made
at
the
races
to
effect
an
entrance
the
same
evening
into
that
lady
house
frederick
felt
as
if
he
had
got
a
lash
with
a
whip
he
was
speedily
appeased
by
the
look
of
utter
confusion
in
cisy
face
a
means
at
the
same
time
a
hunter
and
a
thief
this
is
the
foundation
for
cisy
little
translator
b
de
means
a
or
grouse
hence
the
play
on
the
name
of
la
bruyère
whose
is
a
translator
in
fact
the
maréchale
next
morning
was
filled
with
regret
when
arnoux
her
first
lover
her
good
friend
had
presented
himself
that
very
day
they
both
gave
the
vicomte
to
understand
that
he
was
in
the
way
and
kicked
him
out
without
much
ceremony
he
pretended
not
to
have
heard
what
was
said
the
baron
went
on
what
has
become
of
her
this
fine
rose
is
she
as
pretty
as
ever
showing
by
his
manner
that
he
had
been
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
her
frederick
was
chagrined
by
the
discovery
there
nothing
to
blush
at
said
the
baron
pursuing
the
topic
is
a
good
thing
cisy
smacked
his
tongue
whew
not
so
good
ha
oh
dear
yes
in
the
first
place
i
found
her
nothing
extraordinary
and
then
you
pick
up
the
like
of
her
as
often
as
you
please
for
in
fact
she
is
for
sale
not
for
everyone
remarked
frederick
with
some
bitterness
he
imagines
that
he
is
different
from
the
others
was
cisy
comment
what
a
good
joke
and
a
laugh
ran
round
the
table
frederick
felt
as
if
the
palpitations
of
his
heart
would
suffocate
him
he
swallowed
two
glasses
of
water
one
after
the
other
but
the
baron
had
preserved
a
lively
recollection
of
rosanette
is
she
still
interested
in
a
fellow
named
arnoux
i
have
the
faintest
idea
said
cisy
i
do
know
that
gentleman
nevertheless
he
suggested
that
he
believed
arnoux
was
a
sort
of
swindler
a
moment
exclaimed
frederick
however
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
legal
proceedings
have
been
taken
against
him
that
is
not
true
frederick
began
to
defend
arnoux
vouched
for
his
honesty
ended
by
convincing
himself
of
it
and
concocted
figures
and
proofs
the
vicomte
full
of
spite
and
tipsy
in
addition
persisted
in
his
assertions
so
that
frederick
said
to
him
gravely
is
the
object
of
this
to
give
offence
to
me
monsieur
and
he
looked
cisy
full
in
the
face
with
eyeballs
as
red
as
his
cigar
oh
not
at
all
i
grant
you
that
he
possesses
something
very
nice
his
wife
do
you
know
her
faith
i
do
sophie
arnoux
everyone
knows
her
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
cisy
who
had
staggered
to
his
feet
hiccoughed
everyone
knows
her
hold
your
tongue
it
is
not
with
women
of
her
sort
you
keep
company
i
flatter
myself
it
is
frederick
flung
a
plate
at
his
face
it
passed
like
a
flash
of
lightning
over
the
table
knocked
down
two
bottles
demolished
a
and
breaking
into
three
pieces
by
knocking
against
the
épergne
hit
the
vicomte
in
the
stomach
all
the
other
guests
arose
to
hold
him
back
he
struggled
and
shrieked
possessed
by
a
kind
of
frenzy
des
aulnays
kept
repeating
come
be
calm
my
dear
boy
why
this
is
frightful
shouted
the
tutor
forchambeaux
livid
as
a
plum
was
trembling
joseph
indulged
in
repeated
outbursts
of
laughter
the
attendants
sponged
out
the
traces
of
the
wine
and
gathered
up
the
remains
of
the
dinner
from
the
floor
and
the
baron
went
and
shut
the
window
for
the
uproar
in
spite
of
the
noise
of
could
be
heard
on
the
boulevard
as
all
present
at
the
moment
the
plate
had
been
flung
had
been
talking
at
the
same
time
it
was
impossible
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
attack
whether
it
was
on
account
of
arnoux
madame
arnoux
rosanette
or
somebody
else
one
thing
only
they
were
certain
of
that
frederick
had
acted
with
indescribable
brutality
on
his
part
he
refused
positively
to
testify
the
slightest
regret
for
what
he
had
done
des
aulnays
tried
to
soften
him
cousin
joseph
the
tutor
and
forchambeaux
himself
joined
in
the
effort
the
baron
all
this
time
was
cheering
up
cisy
who
yielding
to
nervous
weakness
began
to
shed
tears
frederick
on
the
contrary
was
getting
more
and
more
angry
and
they
would
have
remained
there
till
daybreak
if
the
baron
had
not
said
in
order
to
bring
matters
to
a
close
the
vicomte
monsieur
will
send
his
seconds
to
call
on
you
your
hour
twelve
if
it
suits
you
perfectly
monsieur
frederick
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
open
air
drew
a
deep
breath
he
had
been
keeping
his
feelings
too
long
under
restraint
he
had
satisfied
them
at
last
he
felt
so
to
speak
the
pride
of
virility
a
superabundance
of
energy
within
him
which
intoxicated
him
he
required
two
seconds
the
first
person
he
thought
of
for
the
purpose
was
regimbart
and
he
immediately
directed
his
steps
towards
the
rue
the
was
closed
but
some
light
shone
through
a
pane
of
glass
over
the
door
it
opened
and
he
went
in
stooping
very
low
as
he
passed
under
the
penthouse
a
candle
at
the
side
of
the
bar
lighted
up
the
deserted
all
the
stools
with
their
feet
in
the
air
were
piled
on
the
table
the
master
and
mistress
with
their
waiter
were
at
supper
in
a
corner
near
the
kitchen
and
regimbart
with
his
hat
on
his
head
was
sharing
their
meal
and
even
disturbed
the
waiter
who
was
compelled
every
moment
to
turn
aside
a
little
frederick
having
briefly
explained
the
matter
to
him
asked
regimbart
to
assist
him
the
citizen
at
first
made
no
reply
he
rolled
his
eyes
about
looked
as
if
he
were
plunged
in
reflection
took
several
strides
around
the
room
and
at
last
said
yes
by
all
means
and
a
homicidal
smile
smoothed
his
brow
when
he
learned
that
the
adversary
was
a
nobleman
make
your
mind
easy
we
rout
him
with
flying
colours
in
the
first
place
with
the
sword
but
perhaps
broke
in
frederick
i
have
not
the
right
i
tell
you
is
necessary
to
take
the
sword
the
citizen
replied
roughly
do
you
know
how
to
make
passes
a
little
oh
a
little
this
is
the
way
with
all
of
them
and
yet
they
have
a
mania
for
committing
assaults
what
does
the
teach
listen
to
me
keep
a
good
distance
off
always
confining
yourself
in
circles
and
parry
parry
as
you
retire
that
is
permitted
tire
him
out
then
boldly
make
a
lunge
on
him
and
above
all
no
malice
no
strokes
of
the
la
fougère
kind
c
no
a
simple
and
some
disengagements
look
here
do
you
see
while
you
turn
your
wrist
as
if
opening
a
lock
père
vauthier
give
me
your
cane
ha
that
will
do
he
grasped
the
rod
which
was
used
for
lighting
the
gas
rounded
his
left
arm
bent
his
right
and
began
to
make
some
thrusts
against
the
partition
he
stamped
with
his
foot
got
animated
and
pretended
to
be
encountering
difficulties
while
he
exclaimed
are
you
there
is
that
it
are
you
there
and
his
enormous
silhouette
projected
itself
on
the
wall
with
his
hat
apparently
touching
the
ceiling
the
owner
of
the
café
shouted
from
time
to
time
bravo
very
good
his
wife
though
a
little
unnerved
was
likewise
filled
with
admiration
and
théodore
who
had
been
in
the
army
remained
riveted
to
the
spot
with
amazement
the
fact
being
however
that
he
regarded
regimbart
with
a
species
of
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
frederick
hurried
to
the
establishment
in
which
dussardier
was
employed
after
having
passed
through
a
succession
of
departments
all
full
of
either
adorning
shelves
or
lying
on
tables
while
here
and
there
shawls
were
fixed
on
wooden
racks
shaped
like
toadstools
he
saw
the
young
man
in
a
sort
of
railed
cage
surrounded
by
and
standing
in
front
of
a
desk
at
which
he
was
writing
the
honest
fellow
left
his
work
c
in
a
certain
la
fougère
brought
out
a
work
entitled
de
jamais
tué
ni
blessé
en
duel
sans
avons
pris
aucune
leçon
et
lors
même
aurait
affaire
au
premier
tireur
de
translator
the
seconds
arrived
before
twelve
frederick
as
a
matter
of
good
taste
thought
he
ought
not
to
be
present
at
the
conference
the
baron
and
joseph
declared
that
they
would
be
satisfied
with
the
simplest
excuses
but
regimbart
principle
being
never
to
yield
and
his
contention
being
that
arnoux
honour
should
be
vindicated
frederick
had
not
spoken
to
him
about
anything
else
he
asked
that
the
vicomte
should
apologise
de
comaing
was
indignant
at
this
presumption
the
citizen
would
not
abate
an
inch
as
all
conciliation
proved
impracticable
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
fight
other
difficulties
arose
for
the
choice
of
weapons
lay
with
cisy
as
the
person
to
whom
the
insult
had
been
offered
but
regimbart
maintained
that
by
sending
the
challenge
he
had
constituted
himself
the
offending
party
his
seconds
loudly
protested
that
a
buffet
was
the
most
cruel
of
offences
the
citizen
carped
at
the
words
pointing
out
that
a
buffet
was
not
a
blow
finally
they
decided
to
refer
the
matter
to
a
military
man
and
the
four
seconds
went
off
to
consult
the
officers
in
some
of
the
barracks
they
drew
up
at
the
barracks
on
the
quai
de
comaing
having
accosted
two
captains
explained
to
them
the
question
in
dispute
the
captains
did
not
understand
a
word
of
what
he
was
saying
owing
to
the
confusion
caused
by
the
citizen
incidental
remarks
in
short
they
advised
the
gentlemen
who
consulted
them
to
draw
up
a
minute
of
the
proceedings
after
which
they
would
give
their
decision
thereupon
they
repaired
to
a
café
and
they
even
in
order
to
do
things
with
more
circumspection
referred
to
cisy
as
h
and
frederick
as
then
they
returned
to
the
barracks
the
officers
had
gone
out
they
reappeared
and
declared
that
the
choice
of
arms
manifestly
belonged
to
they
all
returned
to
cisy
abode
regimbart
and
dussardier
remained
on
the
footpath
outside
the
vicomte
when
he
was
informed
of
the
solution
of
the
case
was
seized
with
such
extreme
agitation
that
they
had
to
repeat
for
him
several
times
the
decision
of
the
officers
and
when
de
comaing
came
to
deal
with
regimbart
contention
he
murmured
nevertheless
not
being
very
reluctant
himself
to
yield
to
it
then
he
let
himself
sink
into
an
armchair
and
declared
that
he
would
not
fight
eh
what
said
the
baron
then
cisy
indulged
in
a
confused
flood
of
mouthings
he
wished
to
fight
with
firearms
to
discharge
a
single
pistol
at
close
quarters
or
else
we
will
put
arsenic
into
a
glass
and
draw
lots
to
see
who
must
drink
it
that
sometimes
done
i
read
of
it
the
baron
naturally
rather
impatient
addressed
him
in
a
harsh
tone
these
gentlemen
are
waiting
for
your
answer
this
is
indecent
to
put
it
shortly
what
weapons
are
you
going
to
take
come
is
it
the
sword
the
vicomte
gave
an
affirmative
reply
by
merely
nodding
his
head
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
meeting
should
take
place
next
morning
at
seven
sharp
at
the
maillot
gate
dussardier
being
compelled
to
go
back
to
his
business
regimbart
went
to
inform
frederick
about
the
arrangement
he
had
been
left
all
day
without
any
news
and
his
impatience
was
becoming
intolerable
so
much
the
better
he
exclaimed
the
citizen
was
satisfied
with
his
deportment
would
you
believe
it
they
wanted
an
apology
from
us
it
was
nothing
a
mere
word
but
i
knocked
them
off
their
nicely
the
right
thing
to
do
was
it
undoubtedly
said
frederick
thinking
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
choose
another
second
then
when
he
was
alone
he
repeated
several
times
in
a
very
loud
tone
i
am
going
to
fight
hold
on
i
am
going
to
fight
is
funny
and
as
he
walked
up
and
down
his
room
while
passing
in
front
of
the
mirror
he
noticed
that
he
was
pale
have
i
any
reason
to
be
afraid
he
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
intolerable
misery
at
the
prospect
of
exhibiting
fear
on
the
ground
and
yet
suppose
i
happen
to
be
killed
my
father
met
his
death
the
same
way
yes
i
shall
be
killed
and
suddenly
his
mother
rose
up
before
him
in
a
black
dress
incoherent
images
floated
before
his
mind
his
own
cowardice
exasperated
him
a
paroxysm
of
courage
a
thirst
for
human
blood
took
possession
of
him
a
battalion
could
not
have
made
him
retreat
when
this
feverish
excitement
had
cooled
down
he
was
overjoyed
to
feel
that
his
nerves
were
perfectly
steady
in
order
to
divert
his
thoughts
he
went
to
the
opera
where
a
ballet
was
being
performed
he
listened
to
the
music
looked
at
the
through
his
and
drank
a
glass
of
punch
between
the
acts
but
when
he
got
home
again
the
sight
of
his
study
of
his
furniture
in
the
midst
of
which
he
found
himself
for
the
last
time
made
him
feel
ready
to
swoon
he
went
down
to
the
garden
the
stars
were
shining
he
gazed
up
at
them
the
idea
of
fighting
about
a
woman
gave
him
a
greater
importance
in
his
own
eyes
and
surrounded
him
with
a
halo
of
nobility
then
he
went
to
bed
in
a
tranquil
frame
of
mind
it
was
not
so
with
cisy
after
the
baron
departure
joseph
had
tried
to
revive
his
drooping
spirits
and
as
the
vicomte
remained
in
the
same
dull
mood
however
old
boy
if
you
prefer
to
remain
at
home
i
go
and
say
so
cisy
durst
not
answer
certainly
but
he
would
have
liked
his
cousin
to
do
him
this
service
without
speaking
about
it
he
wished
that
frederick
would
die
during
the
night
of
an
attack
of
apoplexy
or
that
a
riot
would
break
out
so
that
next
morning
there
would
be
enough
of
barricades
to
shut
up
all
the
approaches
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
or
that
some
emergency
might
prevent
one
of
the
seconds
from
being
present
for
in
the
absence
of
seconds
the
duel
would
fall
through
he
felt
a
longing
to
save
himself
by
taking
an
express
train
no
matter
where
he
regretted
that
he
did
not
understand
medicine
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
something
which
without
endangering
his
life
would
cause
it
to
be
believed
that
he
was
dead
he
finally
wished
to
be
ill
in
earnest
in
order
to
get
advice
and
assistance
from
someone
he
sent
for
des
aulnays
that
worthy
man
had
gone
back
to
saintonge
on
receiving
a
letter
informing
him
of
the
illness
of
one
of
his
daughters
this
appeared
an
ominous
circumstance
to
cisy
luckily
vezou
his
tutor
came
to
see
him
then
he
unbosomed
himself
what
am
i
to
do
my
god
what
am
i
do
if
i
were
in
your
place
monsieur
i
should
pay
some
strapping
fellow
from
the
to
go
and
give
him
a
drubbing
he
would
still
know
who
brought
it
about
replied
cisy
and
from
time
to
time
he
uttered
a
groan
then
but
is
a
man
bound
to
fight
a
duel
is
a
relic
of
barbarism
what
are
you
to
do
out
of
complaisance
the
pedagogue
invited
himself
to
dinner
his
pupil
did
not
eat
anything
but
after
the
meal
felt
the
necessity
of
taking
a
short
walk
as
they
were
passing
a
church
he
said
suppose
we
go
in
for
a
little
while
to
look
vezou
asked
nothing
better
and
even
offered
him
holy
water
it
was
the
month
of
may
the
altar
was
covered
with
flowers
voices
were
chanting
the
organ
was
resounding
through
the
church
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
pray
as
the
pomps
of
religion
inspired
him
merely
with
thoughts
of
funerals
he
fancied
that
he
could
hear
the
murmurs
of
the
let
us
go
away
i
do
feel
well
they
spent
the
whole
night
playing
cards
the
vicomte
made
an
effort
to
lose
in
order
to
exorcise
a
thing
which
vezou
turned
to
his
own
advantage
at
last
at
the
first
streak
of
dawn
cisy
who
could
stand
it
no
longer
sank
down
on
the
green
cloth
and
was
soon
plunged
in
sleep
which
was
disturbed
by
unpleasant
dreams
if
courage
however
consists
in
wishing
to
get
the
better
of
one
own
weakness
the
vicomte
was
courageous
for
in
the
presence
of
his
seconds
who
came
to
seek
him
he
stiffened
himself
up
with
all
the
strength
he
could
command
vanity
making
him
realise
that
to
attempt
to
draw
back
now
would
destroy
him
de
comaing
congratulated
him
on
his
good
appearance
but
on
the
way
the
jolting
of
the
cab
and
the
heat
of
the
morning
sun
made
him
languish
his
energy
gave
way
again
he
could
not
even
distinguish
any
longer
where
they
were
the
baron
amused
himself
by
increasing
his
terror
talking
about
the
corpse
and
of
the
way
they
meant
to
get
back
clandestinely
to
the
city
joseph
gave
the
rejoinder
both
considering
the
affair
ridiculous
were
certain
that
it
would
be
settled
cisy
kept
his
head
on
his
breast
he
lifted
it
up
slowly
and
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
had
not
taken
a
doctor
with
them
is
needless
said
the
baron
then
there
no
danger
joseph
answered
in
a
grave
tone
let
us
hope
so
and
nobody
in
the
carriage
made
any
further
remark
at
ten
minutes
past
seven
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
maillot
gate
frederick
and
his
seconds
were
there
the
entire
group
being
dressed
all
in
black
regimbart
instead
of
a
cravat
wore
a
stiff
horsehair
collar
like
a
trooper
and
he
carried
a
long
adapted
for
adventures
of
this
kind
they
exchanged
frigid
bows
then
they
all
plunged
into
the
bois
de
boulogne
taking
the
madrid
road
in
order
to
find
a
suitable
place
regimbart
said
to
frederick
who
was
walking
between
him
and
dussardier
well
and
this
scare
what
do
we
care
about
it
if
you
want
anything
do
annoy
yourself
about
it
i
know
what
to
do
fear
is
natural
to
man
then
in
a
low
tone
do
smoke
any
more
in
this
case
it
has
a
weakening
effect
frederick
threw
away
his
cigar
which
had
only
a
disturbing
effect
on
his
brain
and
went
on
with
a
firm
step
the
vicomte
advanced
behind
leaning
on
the
arms
of
his
two
seconds
occasional
wayfarers
crossed
their
path
the
sky
was
blue
and
from
time
to
time
they
heard
rabbits
skipping
about
at
the
turn
of
a
path
a
woman
in
a
madras
neckerchief
was
chatting
with
a
man
in
a
blouse
and
in
the
large
avenue
under
the
some
grooms
in
vests
of
were
walking
horses
up
and
down
cisy
recalled
the
happy
days
when
mounted
on
his
own
chestnut
horse
and
with
his
glass
stuck
in
his
eye
he
rode
up
to
these
recollections
intensified
his
wretchedness
an
intolerable
thirst
parched
his
throat
the
buzzing
of
flies
mingled
with
the
throbbing
of
his
arteries
his
feet
sank
into
the
sand
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
walking
during
a
period
which
had
neither
beginning
nor
end
the
seconds
without
stopping
examined
with
keen
glances
each
side
of
the
path
they
were
traversing
they
hesitated
as
to
whether
they
would
go
to
the
catelan
cross
or
under
the
walls
of
the
bagatelle
at
last
they
took
a
turn
to
the
right
and
they
drew
up
in
a
kind
of
quincunx
in
the
midst
of
the
the
spot
was
chosen
in
such
a
way
that
the
level
ground
was
cut
equally
into
two
divisions
the
two
places
at
which
the
principals
in
the
duel
were
to
take
their
stand
were
marked
out
then
regimbart
opened
his
case
it
was
lined
with
red
and
contained
four
charming
swords
hollowed
in
the
centre
with
handles
which
were
adorned
with
filigree
a
ray
of
light
passing
through
the
leaves
fell
on
them
and
they
appeared
to
cisy
to
glitter
like
silver
vipers
on
a
sea
of
blood
the
citizen
showed
that
they
were
of
equal
length
he
took
one
himself
in
order
to
separate
the
combatants
in
case
of
necessity
de
comaing
held
a
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
they
looked
at
each
other
all
the
faces
had
in
them
something
fierce
or
cruel
frederick
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
his
waistcoat
joseph
aided
cisy
to
do
the
same
when
his
cravat
was
removed
a
blessed
medal
could
be
seen
on
his
neck
this
made
regimbart
smile
contemptuously
then
de
comaing
in
order
to
allow
frederick
another
moment
for
reflection
tried
to
raise
some
quibbles
he
demanded
the
right
to
put
on
a
glove
and
to
catch
hold
of
his
adversary
sword
with
the
left
hand
regimbart
who
was
in
a
hurry
made
no
objection
to
this
at
last
the
baron
addressing
frederick
everything
depends
on
you
monsieur
there
is
never
any
dishonour
in
acknowledging
one
faults
dussardier
made
a
gesture
of
approval
the
citizen
gave
vent
to
his
indignation
do
you
think
we
came
here
as
a
mere
sham
damn
it
be
on
your
guard
each
of
you
the
combatants
were
facing
one
another
with
their
seconds
by
their
sides
he
uttered
the
single
word
come
cisy
became
dreadfully
pale
the
end
of
his
blade
was
quivering
like
a
horsewhip
his
head
fell
back
his
hands
dropped
down
helplessly
and
he
sank
unconscious
on
the
ground
joseph
raised
him
up
and
while
holding
a
to
his
nose
gave
him
a
good
shaking
the
vicomte
reopened
his
eyes
then
suddenly
grasped
at
his
sword
like
a
madman
frederick
had
held
his
in
readiness
and
now
awaited
him
with
steady
eye
and
uplifted
hand
stop
stop
cried
a
voice
which
came
from
the
road
simultaneously
with
the
sound
of
a
horse
at
full
gallop
and
the
hood
of
a
cab
broke
the
branches
a
man
bending
out
his
head
waved
a
handkerchief
still
exclaiming
stop
stop
de
comaing
believing
that
this
meant
the
intervention
of
the
police
lifted
up
his
make
an
end
of
it
the
vicomte
is
bleeding
i
said
cisy
in
fact
he
had
in
his
fall
taken
off
the
skin
of
his
left
thumb
but
this
was
by
falling
observed
the
citizen
the
baron
pretended
not
to
understand
arnoux
had
jumped
out
of
the
cab
i
have
arrived
too
late
no
thanks
be
to
god
he
threw
his
arms
around
frederick
felt
him
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
i
am
the
cause
of
it
you
wanted
to
defend
your
old
friend
right
that
right
never
shall
i
forget
it
how
good
you
are
ah
my
own
dear
boy
he
gazed
at
frederick
and
shed
tears
while
he
chuckled
with
delight
the
baron
turned
towards
joseph
i
believe
we
are
in
the
way
at
this
little
family
party
it
is
over
messieurs
is
it
not
vicomte
put
your
arm
into
a
sling
hold
on
here
is
my
silk
handkerchief
then
with
an
imperious
gesture
come
no
spite
this
is
as
it
should
be
the
two
adversaries
shook
hands
in
a
very
lukewarm
fashion
the
vicomte
de
comaing
and
joseph
disappeared
in
one
direction
and
frederick
left
with
his
friends
in
the
opposite
direction
as
the
madrid
restaurant
was
not
far
off
arnoux
proposed
that
they
should
go
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
there
we
might
even
have
breakfast
but
as
dussardier
had
no
time
to
lose
they
confined
themselves
to
taking
some
refreshment
in
the
garden
they
all
experienced
that
sense
of
satisfaction
which
follows
happy
the
citizen
nevertheless
was
annoyed
at
the
duel
having
been
interrupted
at
the
most
critical
stage
arnoux
had
been
apprised
of
it
by
a
person
named
compain
a
friend
of
regimbart
and
with
an
irrepressible
outburst
of
emotion
he
had
rushed
to
the
spot
to
prevent
it
under
the
impression
however
that
he
was
the
occasion
of
it
he
begged
of
frederick
to
furnish
him
with
some
details
about
it
frederick
touched
by
these
proofs
of
affection
felt
some
scruples
at
the
idea
of
increasing
his
misapprehension
of
the
facts
for
mercy
sake
do
say
any
more
about
it
arnoux
thought
that
this
reserve
showed
great
delicacy
then
with
his
habitual
levity
he
passed
on
to
some
fresh
subject
what
news
citizen
and
they
began
talking
about
banking
transactions
and
the
number
of
bills
that
were
falling
due
in
order
to
be
more
undisturbed
they
went
to
another
table
where
they
exchanged
whispered
confidences
frederick
could
overhear
the
following
words
you
are
going
to
back
me
up
with
your
signature
yes
but
you
mind
i
have
negotiated
it
at
last
for
three
hundred
a
nice
commission
faith
in
short
it
was
clear
that
arnoux
was
mixed
up
in
a
great
many
shady
transactions
with
the
citizen
frederick
thought
of
reminding
him
about
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
but
his
last
step
forbade
the
utterance
of
any
reproachful
words
even
of
the
mildest
description
besides
he
felt
tired
himself
and
this
was
not
a
convenient
place
for
talking
about
such
a
thing
he
put
it
off
till
some
future
day
arnoux
seated
in
the
shade
of
an
evergreen
was
smoking
with
a
look
of
joviality
in
his
face
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
doors
of
private
rooms
looking
out
on
the
garden
and
said
he
had
often
paid
visits
to
the
house
in
former
days
probably
not
by
yourself
returned
the
citizen
faith
you
right
there
what
blackguardism
you
do
carry
on
you
a
married
man
well
and
what
about
yourself
retorted
arnoux
and
with
an
indulgent
smile
i
am
even
sure
that
this
rascal
here
has
a
room
of
his
own
somewhere
into
which
he
takes
his
friends
the
citizen
confessed
that
this
was
true
by
simply
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
these
two
gentlemen
entered
into
their
respective
tastes
with
regard
to
the
sex
arnoux
now
preferred
youth
regimbart
hated
affected
women
and
went
in
for
the
genuine
article
before
anything
else
the
conclusion
which
the
laid
down
at
the
close
of
this
discussion
was
that
women
were
not
to
be
taken
seriously
nevertheless
he
is
fond
of
his
own
wife
thought
frederick
as
he
made
his
way
home
and
he
looked
on
arnoux
as
a
man
he
had
a
grudge
against
him
on
account
of
the
duel
as
if
it
had
been
for
the
sake
of
this
individual
that
he
risked
his
life
a
little
while
before
but
he
felt
grateful
to
dussardier
for
his
devotedness
ere
long
the
came
at
his
invitation
to
pay
him
a
visit
every
day
frederick
lent
him
books
thiers
dulaure
barante
and
the
honest
fellow
listened
to
everything
the
other
said
with
a
thoughtful
air
and
accepted
his
opinions
as
those
of
a
master
one
evening
he
arrived
looking
quite
scared
that
morning
on
the
boulevard
a
man
who
was
running
so
quickly
that
he
had
got
out
of
breath
had
jostled
against
him
and
having
recognised
in
him
a
friend
of
sénécal
had
said
to
him
he
has
just
been
taken
i
am
making
my
escape
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
dussardier
had
spent
the
day
making
enquiries
sénécal
was
in
jail
charged
with
an
attempted
crime
of
a
political
nature
the
son
of
an
overseer
he
was
born
at
lyons
and
having
had
as
his
teacher
a
former
disciple
of
chalier
he
had
on
his
arrival
in
paris
obtained
admission
into
the
society
of
families
his
ways
were
known
and
the
police
kept
a
watch
on
him
he
was
one
of
those
who
fought
in
the
outbreak
of
may
and
since
then
he
had
remained
in
the
shade
but
his
increasing
more
and
more
he
became
a
fanatical
follower
of
alibaud
mixing
up
his
own
grievances
against
society
with
those
of
the
people
against
monarchy
and
waking
up
every
morning
in
the
hope
of
a
revolution
which
in
a
fortnight
or
a
month
would
turn
the
world
upside
down
at
last
disgusted
at
the
inactivity
of
his
brethren
enraged
at
the
obstacles
that
retarded
the
realisation
of
his
dreams
and
despairing
of
the
country
he
entered
in
his
capacity
of
chemist
into
the
conspiracy
for
the
use
of
incendiary
bombs
and
he
had
been
caught
carrying
gunpowder
of
which
he
was
going
to
make
a
trial
at
montmartre
a
supreme
effort
to
establish
the
republic
dussardier
was
no
less
attached
to
the
republican
idea
for
from
his
point
of
view
it
meant
enfranchisement
and
universal
happiness
one
day
at
the
age
of
fifteen
in
the
rue
transnonain
in
front
of
a
grocer
shop
he
had
seen
soldiers
bayonets
reddened
with
blood
and
exhibiting
human
hairs
pasted
to
the
of
their
guns
since
that
time
the
government
had
filled
him
with
feelings
of
rage
as
the
very
incarnation
of
injustice
he
frequently
confused
the
assassins
with
the
gendarmes
and
in
his
eyes
a
was
just
as
bad
as
a
parricide
all
the
evil
scattered
over
the
earth
he
ingenuously
attributed
to
power
and
he
hated
it
with
a
undying
hatred
that
held
possession
of
his
heart
and
made
his
sensibility
all
the
more
acute
he
had
been
dazzled
by
sénécal
declamations
it
was
of
little
consequence
whether
he
happened
to
be
guilty
or
not
or
whether
the
attempt
with
which
he
was
charged
could
be
characterised
as
an
odious
proceeding
since
he
was
the
victim
of
authority
it
was
only
right
to
help
him
the
peers
will
condemn
him
certainly
then
he
will
be
conveyed
in
a
like
a
convict
and
will
be
shut
up
in
mont
where
the
government
lets
people
die
austen
had
gone
mad
steuben
had
killed
himself
in
order
to
transfer
barbès
into
a
dungeon
they
had
dragged
him
by
the
legs
and
by
the
hair
they
trampled
on
his
body
and
his
head
rebounded
along
the
staircase
at
every
step
they
took
what
abominable
treatment
the
wretches
he
was
choking
with
angry
sobs
and
he
walked
about
the
apartment
in
a
very
excited
frame
of
mind
in
the
meantime
something
must
be
done
come
for
my
part
i
know
what
to
do
suppose
we
tried
to
rescue
him
eh
while
they
are
bringing
him
to
the
luxembourg
we
could
throw
ourselves
on
the
escort
in
the
passage
a
dozen
resolute
men
that
sometimes
is
enough
to
accomplish
it
there
was
so
much
fire
in
his
eyes
that
frederick
was
a
little
startled
by
his
look
he
recalled
to
mind
sénécal
sufferings
and
his
austere
life
without
feeling
the
same
enthusiasm
about
him
as
dussardier
he
experienced
nevertheless
that
admiration
which
is
inspired
by
every
man
who
sacrifices
himself
for
an
idea
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
had
helped
this
man
he
would
not
be
in
his
present
position
and
the
two
friends
anxiously
sought
to
devise
some
contrivance
whereby
they
could
set
him
free
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
get
access
to
him
frederick
examined
the
newspapers
to
try
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
him
and
for
three
weeks
he
was
a
constant
visitor
at
the
one
day
several
numbers
of
the
fell
into
his
hands
the
leading
article
was
invariably
devoted
to
cutting
up
some
distinguished
man
after
that
came
some
society
gossip
and
some
scandals
then
there
were
some
chaffing
observations
about
the
odéon
carpentras
pisciculture
and
prisoners
under
sentence
of
death
when
there
happened
to
be
any
the
disappearance
of
a
furnished
materials
for
a
whole
year
jokes
in
the
third
column
a
under
the
form
of
anecdotes
or
advice
gave
some
tailors
announcements
together
with
accounts
of
evening
parties
advertisements
as
to
auctions
and
analysis
of
artistic
productions
writing
in
the
same
strain
about
a
volume
of
verse
and
a
pair
of
boots
the
only
serious
portion
of
it
was
the
criticism
of
the
small
theatres
in
which
fierce
attacks
were
made
on
two
or
three
managers
and
the
interests
of
art
were
invoked
on
the
subjects
of
the
decorations
of
the
gymnasium
and
of
the
actress
who
played
the
part
of
the
heroine
at
the
délassements
frederick
was
passing
over
all
these
items
when
his
eyes
alighted
on
an
article
entitled
a
lass
between
three
lads
it
was
the
story
of
his
duel
related
in
a
lively
gallic
style
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
himself
for
he
was
indicated
by
this
little
joke
which
frequently
recurred
a
young
man
from
the
college
of
sens
who
has
no
sense
he
was
even
represented
as
a
poor
devil
from
the
provinces
an
obscure
booby
trying
to
rub
against
persons
of
high
rank
as
for
the
vicomte
he
was
made
to
play
a
fascinating
part
first
by
having
forced
his
way
into
the
then
by
having
carried
off
the
lady
and
finally
by
having
behaved
all
through
like
a
perfect
gentleman
frederick
courage
was
not
denied
exactly
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
an
intermediary
the
himself
had
come
on
the
scene
just
in
the
nick
of
time
the
entire
article
concluded
with
this
phrase
pregnant
perhaps
with
sinister
meaning
what
is
the
cause
of
their
affection
a
problem
and
as
bazile
says
who
the
deuce
is
it
that
is
deceived
here
this
was
beyond
all
doubt
hussonnet
revenge
against
frederick
for
having
refused
him
five
thousand
francs
what
was
he
to
do
if
he
demanded
an
explanation
from
him
the
bohemian
would
protest
that
he
was
innocent
and
nothing
would
be
gained
by
doing
this
the
best
course
was
to
swallow
the
affront
in
silence
nobody
after
all
read
the
as
he
left
the
he
saw
some
people
standing
in
front
of
a
shop
they
were
staring
at
the
portrait
of
a
woman
with
this
fine
traced
underneath
in
black
letters
mademoiselle
rosanette
bron
belonging
to
frederick
moreau
of
nogent
it
was
indeed
she
or
at
least
like
her
her
full
face
displayed
her
bosom
uncovered
with
her
hair
hanging
loose
and
with
a
purse
of
red
velvet
in
her
hands
while
behind
her
a
peacock
leaned
his
beak
over
her
shoulder
covering
the
wall
with
his
immense
plumage
in
the
shape
of
a
fan
pellerin
had
got
up
this
exhibition
in
order
to
compel
frederick
to
pay
persuaded
that
he
was
a
celebrity
and
that
all
paris
roused
to
take
his
part
would
be
interested
in
this
wretched
piece
of
work
was
this
a
conspiracy
had
the
painter
and
the
journalist
prepared
their
attack
on
him
at
the
same
time
his
duel
had
not
put
a
stop
to
anything
he
had
become
an
object
of
ridicule
and
everyone
had
been
laughing
at
him
three
days
afterwards
at
the
end
of
june
the
northern
shares
having
had
a
rise
of
fifteen
francs
as
he
had
bought
two
thousand
of
them
within
the
past
month
he
found
that
he
had
made
thirty
thousand
francs
by
them
this
caress
of
fortune
gave
him
renewed
he
said
to
himself
that
he
wanted
nobody
help
and
that
all
his
embarrassments
were
the
result
of
his
timidity
and
indecision
he
ought
to
have
begun
his
intrigue
with
the
maréchale
with
brutal
directness
and
refused
hussonnet
the
very
first
day
he
should
not
have
compromised
himself
with
pellerin
and
in
order
to
show
that
he
was
not
a
bit
embarrassed
he
presented
himself
at
one
of
madame
dambreuse
ordinary
evening
parties
in
the
middle
of
the
anteroom
martinon
who
had
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
he
had
turned
round
what
so
you
are
visiting
here
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
as
if
displeased
at
seeing
him
why
not
and
while
asking
himself
what
could
be
the
cause
of
such
a
display
of
hostility
on
martinon
part
frederick
made
his
way
into
the
the
light
was
dim
in
spite
of
the
lamps
placed
in
the
corners
for
the
three
windows
which
were
wide
open
made
three
large
squares
of
black
shadow
stand
parallel
with
each
other
under
the
pictures
occupied
at
a
man
height
the
spaces
on
the
walls
and
a
silver
teapot
with
a
samovar
cast
their
reflections
in
a
mirror
on
the
background
there
arose
a
murmur
of
hushed
voices
pumps
could
be
heard
creaking
on
the
carpet
he
could
distinguish
a
number
of
black
coats
then
a
round
table
lighted
up
by
a
large
shaded
lamp
seven
or
eight
ladies
in
summer
toilets
and
at
some
little
distance
madame
dambreuse
in
a
rocking
armchair
her
dress
of
lilac
taffeta
had
slashed
sleeves
from
which
fell
muslin
puffs
the
charming
tint
of
the
material
harmonising
with
the
shade
of
her
hair
and
she
sat
slightly
thrown
back
with
the
tip
of
her
foot
on
a
cushion
with
the
repose
of
an
exquisitely
delicate
work
of
art
a
flower
of
high
culture
dambreuse
and
an
old
gentleman
with
a
white
head
were
walking
from
one
end
of
the
to
the
other
some
of
the
guests
chatted
here
and
there
sitting
on
the
edges
of
little
sofas
while
the
others
standing
up
formed
a
circle
in
the
centre
of
the
apartment
they
were
talking
about
votes
amendments
grandin
speech
and
benoist
reply
the
third
party
had
decidedly
gone
too
far
the
left
centre
ought
to
have
had
a
better
recollection
of
its
origin
serious
attacks
had
been
made
on
the
ministry
it
must
be
reassuring
however
to
see
that
it
had
no
successor
in
short
the
situation
was
completely
analogous
to
that
of
as
these
things
bored
frederick
he
drew
near
the
ladies
martinon
was
beside
them
standing
up
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
showing
himself
in
profile
and
looking
so
neat
that
he
resembled
a
piece
of
sèvres
porcelain
he
took
up
a
copy
of
the
des
deux
which
was
lying
on
the
table
between
an
and
an
de
and
spoke
of
a
distinguished
poet
in
a
contemptuous
tone
said
he
was
going
to
the
conferences
of
complained
of
his
larynx
swallowed
from
time
to
time
a
pellet
of
gummatum
and
in
the
meantime
kept
talking
about
music
and
played
the
part
of
the
elegant
trifler
mademoiselle
cécile
dambreuse
niece
who
happened
to
be
embroidering
a
pair
of
ruffles
gazed
at
him
with
her
pale
blue
eyes
and
miss
john
the
governess
who
had
a
flat
nose
laid
aside
her
tapestry
on
his
account
both
of
them
appeared
to
be
exclaiming
internally
how
handsome
he
is
madame
dambreuse
turned
round
towards
him
please
give
me
my
fan
which
is
on
that
over
there
you
are
taking
the
wrong
one
is
the
other
she
arose
and
when
he
came
across
to
her
they
met
in
the
middle
of
the
face
to
face
she
addressed
a
few
sharp
words
to
him
no
doubt
of
a
reproachful
character
judging
by
the
haughty
expression
of
her
face
martinon
tried
to
smile
then
he
went
to
join
the
circle
in
which
grave
men
were
holding
discussions
madame
dambreuse
resumed
her
seat
and
bending
over
the
arm
of
her
chair
said
to
frederick
i
saw
somebody
the
day
before
yesterday
who
was
speaking
to
me
about
you
monsieur
de
cisy
you
know
him
do
you
yes
slightly
suddenly
madame
dambreuse
uttered
an
exclamation
oh
duchesse
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
and
she
advanced
towards
the
door
to
meet
a
little
old
lady
in
a
carmelite
taffeta
gown
and
a
cap
of
guipure
with
long
borders
the
daughter
of
a
companion
in
exile
of
the
comte
and
the
widow
of
a
marshal
of
the
empire
who
had
been
created
a
peer
of
france
in
she
adhered
to
the
court
of
a
former
generation
as
well
as
to
the
new
court
and
possessed
sufficient
influence
to
procure
many
things
those
who
stood
talking
stepped
aside
and
then
resumed
their
conversation
it
had
now
turned
on
pauperism
of
which
according
to
these
gentlemen
all
the
descriptions
that
had
been
given
were
grossly
exaggerated
however
urged
martinon
let
us
confess
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
want
but
the
remedy
depends
neither
on
science
nor
on
power
it
is
purely
an
individual
question
when
the
lower
classes
are
willing
to
get
rid
of
their
vices
they
will
free
themselves
from
their
necessities
let
the
people
be
more
moral
and
they
will
be
less
poor
according
to
dambreuse
no
good
could
be
attained
without
a
superabundance
of
capital
therefore
the
only
practicable
method
was
to
intrust
as
the
however
proposed
good
heavens
there
was
some
merit
in
their
views
let
us
be
just
to
everybody
to
intrust
i
say
the
cause
of
progress
to
those
who
can
increase
the
public
wealth
imperceptibly
they
began
to
touch
on
great
industrial
undertakings
the
railways
the
and
dambreuse
addressing
frederick
said
to
him
in
a
low
whisper
you
have
not
called
about
that
business
of
ours
frederick
pleaded
illness
but
feeling
that
this
excuse
was
too
absurd
besides
i
need
my
ready
money
is
it
to
buy
a
carriage
asked
madame
dambreuse
who
was
brushing
past
him
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
hand
and
for
a
minute
she
watched
his
face
with
her
head
bent
slightly
over
her
shoulder
she
believed
that
he
was
rosanette
lover
the
allusion
was
obvious
it
seemed
even
to
frederick
that
all
the
ladies
were
staring
at
him
from
a
distance
and
whispering
to
one
another
in
order
to
get
a
better
idea
as
to
what
they
were
thinking
about
he
once
more
approached
them
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
martinon
seated
near
mademoiselle
cécile
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
an
album
it
contained
lithographs
representing
spanish
costumes
he
read
the
descriptive
titles
aloud
a
lady
of
seville
a
valencia
gardener
an
andalusian
picador
and
once
when
he
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
page
he
continued
all
in
one
breath
jacques
arnoux
publisher
one
of
your
friends
eh
that
is
true
said
frederick
hurt
by
the
tone
he
had
assumed
madame
dambreuse
again
interposed
in
fact
you
came
here
one
morning
about
a
house
i
believe
a
house
belonging
to
his
wife
this
meant
she
is
your
mistress
he
reddened
up
to
his
ears
and
dambreuse
who
joined
them
at
the
same
moment
made
this
additional
remark
you
appear
even
to
be
deeply
interested
in
them
these
last
words
had
the
effect
of
putting
frederick
out
of
countenance
his
confusion
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
was
evident
to
them
was
on
the
point
of
confirming
their
suspicions
when
dambreuse
drew
close
to
him
and
in
a
tone
of
great
seriousness
said
i
suppose
you
do
do
business
together
he
protested
by
repeated
shakes
of
the
head
without
realising
the
exact
meaning
of
the
capitalist
who
wished
to
give
him
advice
he
felt
a
desire
to
leave
the
fear
of
appearing
restrained
him
a
servant
carried
away
the
teacups
madame
dambreuse
was
talking
to
a
diplomatist
in
a
blue
coat
two
young
girls
drawing
their
foreheads
close
together
showed
each
other
their
jewellery
the
others
seated
in
a
semicircle
on
armchairs
kept
gently
moving
their
white
faces
crowned
with
black
or
fair
hair
nobody
in
fact
minded
them
frederick
turned
on
his
heels
and
by
a
succession
of
long
zigzags
he
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
passing
close
to
a
bracket
he
remarked
on
the
top
of
it
between
a
china
vase
and
the
wainscoting
a
journal
folded
up
in
two
he
drew
it
out
a
little
and
read
these
words
who
had
brought
it
there
cisy
manifestly
no
one
else
what
did
it
matter
however
they
would
believe
already
perhaps
everyone
believed
in
the
article
what
was
the
cause
of
this
rancour
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
ironical
silence
he
felt
like
one
lost
in
a
desert
but
suddenly
he
heard
martinon
voice
talking
of
arnoux
i
saw
in
the
newspapers
amongst
the
names
of
those
accused
of
preparing
incendiary
bombs
that
of
one
of
his
sénécal
is
that
our
sénécal
the
very
same
martinon
repeated
several
times
in
a
very
loud
tone
what
our
sénécal
our
sénécal
then
questions
were
asked
him
about
the
conspiracy
it
was
assumed
that
his
connection
with
the
prosecutor
office
ought
to
furnish
him
with
some
information
on
the
subject
he
declared
that
he
had
none
however
he
knew
very
little
about
this
individual
having
seen
him
only
two
or
three
times
he
positively
regarded
him
as
a
very
fellow
frederick
exclaimed
indignantly
not
at
all
he
is
a
very
honest
fellow
all
the
same
monsieur
said
a
landowner
no
conspirator
can
be
an
honest
man
most
of
the
men
assembled
there
had
served
at
least
four
governments
and
they
would
have
sold
france
or
the
human
race
in
order
to
preserve
their
own
incomes
to
save
themselves
from
any
discomfort
or
embarrassment
or
even
through
sheer
baseness
through
worship
of
force
they
all
maintained
that
political
crimes
were
inexcusable
it
would
be
more
desirable
to
pardon
those
which
were
provoked
by
want
and
they
did
not
fail
to
put
forward
the
eternal
illustration
of
the
father
of
a
family
stealing
the
eternal
loaf
of
bread
from
the
eternal
baker
a
gentleman
occupying
an
administrative
office
even
went
so
far
as
to
exclaim
for
my
part
monsieur
if
i
were
told
that
my
brother
were
a
conspirator
i
would
denounce
him
frederick
invoked
the
right
of
resistance
and
recalling
to
mind
some
phrases
that
deslauriers
had
used
in
their
conversations
he
referred
to
delosmes
blackstone
the
english
bill
of
rights
and
article
of
the
constitution
of
it
was
even
by
virtue
of
this
law
that
the
fall
of
napoléon
had
been
proclaimed
it
had
been
recognised
in
and
inscribed
at
the
head
of
the
charter
besides
when
the
sovereign
fails
to
fulfil
the
contract
justice
requires
that
he
should
be
overthrown
why
this
is
abominable
exclaimed
a
prefect
wife
all
the
rest
remained
silent
filled
with
vague
terror
as
if
they
had
heard
the
noise
of
bullets
madame
dambreuse
rocked
herself
in
her
chair
and
smiled
as
she
listened
to
him
a
manufacturer
who
had
formerly
been
a
member
of
the
carbonari
tried
to
show
that
the
orléans
family
possessed
good
qualities
no
doubt
there
were
some
abuses
well
what
then
but
we
should
not
talk
about
them
my
dear
monsieur
if
you
knew
how
all
these
clamourings
of
the
opposition
injure
business
what
do
i
care
about
business
said
frederick
he
was
exasperated
by
the
rottenness
of
these
old
men
and
carried
away
by
the
recklessness
which
sometimes
takes
possession
of
even
the
most
timid
he
attacked
the
financiers
the
deputies
the
government
the
king
took
up
the
defence
of
the
arabs
and
gave
vent
to
a
great
deal
of
abusive
language
a
few
of
those
around
him
encouraged
him
in
a
spirit
of
irony
go
on
pray
continue
whilst
others
muttered
the
deuce
what
enthusiasm
at
last
he
thought
the
right
thing
to
do
was
to
retire
and
as
he
was
going
away
dambreuse
said
to
him
alluding
to
the
post
of
secretary
no
definite
arrangement
has
been
yet
arrived
at
but
make
haste
and
madame
dambreuse
you
call
again
soon
will
you
not
frederick
considered
their
parting
salutation
a
last
mockery
he
had
resolved
never
to
come
back
to
this
house
or
to
visit
any
of
these
people
again
he
imagined
that
he
had
offended
them
not
realising
what
vast
funds
of
indifference
society
possesses
these
women
especially
excited
his
indignation
not
a
single
one
of
them
had
backed
him
up
even
with
a
look
of
sympathy
he
felt
angry
with
them
for
not
having
been
moved
by
his
words
as
for
madame
dambreuse
he
found
in
her
something
at
the
same
time
languid
and
cold
which
prevented
him
from
defining
her
character
by
a
formula
had
she
a
lover
and
if
so
who
was
her
lover
was
it
the
diplomatist
or
some
other
perhaps
it
was
martinon
impossible
nevertheless
he
experienced
a
sort
of
jealousy
against
martinon
and
an
unaccountable
against
her
dussardier
having
called
this
evening
as
usual
was
awaiting
him
frederick
heart
was
swelling
with
bitterness
he
unburdened
it
and
his
grievances
though
vague
and
hard
to
understand
saddened
the
honest
he
even
complained
of
his
isolation
dussardier
after
a
little
hesitation
suggested
that
they
ought
to
call
on
deslauriers
frederick
at
the
mention
of
the
advocate
name
was
seized
with
a
longing
to
see
him
once
more
he
was
now
living
in
the
midst
of
profound
intellectual
solitude
and
found
dussardier
company
quite
insufficient
in
reply
to
the
latter
question
frederick
told
him
to
arrange
matters
any
way
he
liked
deslauriers
had
likewise
since
their
quarrel
felt
a
void
in
his
life
he
yielded
without
much
reluctance
to
the
cordial
advances
which
were
made
to
him
the
pair
embraced
each
other
then
began
chatting
about
matters
of
no
consequence
frederick
heart
was
touched
by
deslauriers
display
of
reserve
and
in
order
to
make
him
a
sort
of
reparation
he
told
the
other
next
day
how
he
had
lost
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
without
mentioning
that
these
fifteen
thousand
francs
had
been
originally
intended
for
him
the
advocate
nevertheless
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
of
the
truth
and
this
misadventure
which
justified
in
his
own
mind
his
prejudices
against
arnoux
entirely
disarmed
his
rancour
and
he
did
not
again
refer
to
the
promise
made
by
his
friend
on
a
former
occasion
frederick
misled
by
his
silence
thought
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
a
few
days
afterwards
he
asked
deslauriers
whether
there
was
any
way
in
which
he
could
get
back
his
money
they
might
raise
the
point
that
the
prior
mortgage
was
fraudulent
and
might
take
proceedings
against
the
wife
personally
no
no
not
against
her
exclaimed
frederick
and
yielding
to
the
questions
he
confessed
the
truth
deslauriers
was
convinced
that
frederick
had
not
told
him
the
entire
truth
no
doubt
through
a
feeling
of
delicacy
he
was
hurt
by
this
want
of
confidence
they
were
however
on
the
same
intimate
terms
as
before
and
they
even
found
so
much
pleasure
in
each
other
society
that
presence
was
an
obstacle
to
their
free
intercourse
under
the
pretence
that
they
had
appointments
they
managed
gradually
to
get
rid
of
him
there
are
some
men
whose
only
mission
amongst
their
is
to
serve
as
people
use
them
in
the
same
way
as
if
they
were
bridges
by
stepping
over
them
and
going
on
further
frederick
concealed
nothing
from
his
old
friend
he
told
him
about
the
speculation
and
dambreuse
proposal
the
advocate
grew
thoughtful
that
queer
for
such
a
post
a
man
with
a
good
knowledge
of
law
would
be
required
but
you
could
assist
me
returned
frederick
yes
hold
on
faith
yes
certainly
during
the
same
week
frederick
showed
dussardier
a
letter
from
his
mother
madame
moreau
accused
herself
of
having
misjudged
roque
who
had
given
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
his
conduct
then
she
spoke
of
his
means
and
of
the
possibility
later
of
a
marriage
with
louise
that
would
not
be
a
bad
match
said
deslauriers
frederick
said
it
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
besides
père
roque
was
an
old
trickster
that
in
no
way
affected
the
matter
in
the
advocate
opinion
at
the
end
of
july
an
unaccountable
diminution
in
value
made
the
northern
shares
fall
frederick
had
not
sold
his
he
lost
sixty
thousand
francs
in
one
day
his
income
was
considerably
reduced
he
would
have
to
curtail
his
expenditure
or
take
up
some
calling
or
make
a
brilliant
catch
in
the
matrimonial
market
then
deslauriers
spoke
to
him
about
mademoiselle
roque
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
going
to
get
some
idea
of
things
by
seeing
for
himself
frederick
was
rather
tired
of
city
life
provincial
existence
and
the
maternal
roof
would
be
a
sort
of
recreation
for
him
the
aspect
of
the
streets
of
nogent
as
he
passed
through
them
in
the
moonlight
brought
back
old
memories
to
his
mind
and
he
experienced
a
kind
of
pang
like
persons
who
have
just
returned
home
after
a
long
period
of
travel
at
his
mother
house
all
the
country
visitors
had
assembled
as
in
former
days
mm
gamblin
heudras
and
chambrion
the
lebrun
family
those
young
ladies
the
augers
and
in
addition
père
roque
and
sitting
opposite
to
madame
moreau
at
a
mademoiselle
louise
she
was
now
a
woman
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
of
delight
they
were
all
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
she
remained
standing
motionless
and
the
paleness
of
her
face
was
intensified
by
the
light
issuing
from
four
silver
candlesticks
when
she
resumed
play
her
hand
was
trembling
this
emotion
was
exceedingly
flattering
to
frederick
whose
pride
had
been
sorely
wounded
of
late
he
said
to
himself
you
at
any
rate
will
love
me
and
as
if
he
were
thus
taking
his
revenge
for
the
humiliations
he
had
endured
in
the
capital
he
began
to
affect
the
parisian
lion
retailed
all
the
theatrical
gossip
told
anecdotes
as
to
the
doings
of
society
which
he
had
borrowed
from
the
columns
of
the
cheap
newspapers
and
in
short
dazzled
his
next
morning
madame
moreau
expatiated
on
louise
fine
qualities
then
she
enumerated
the
woods
and
farms
of
which
she
would
be
the
owner
père
roque
wealth
was
considerable
he
had
acquired
it
while
making
investments
for
dambreuse
for
he
had
lent
money
to
persons
who
were
able
to
give
good
security
in
the
shape
of
mortgages
whereby
he
was
enabled
to
demand
additional
sums
or
commissions
the
capital
owing
to
his
energetic
vigilance
was
in
no
danger
of
being
lost
besides
père
roque
never
had
any
hesitation
in
making
a
seizure
then
he
bought
up
the
mortgaged
property
at
a
low
price
and
dambreuse
having
got
back
his
money
found
his
affairs
in
very
good
order
but
this
manipulation
of
business
matters
in
a
way
which
was
not
strictly
legal
compromised
him
with
his
agent
he
could
refuse
père
roque
nothing
and
it
was
owing
to
the
latter
solicitations
that
dambreuse
had
received
frederick
so
cordially
the
truth
was
that
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
père
roque
cherished
a
ambition
he
wished
his
daughter
to
be
a
countess
and
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
this
object
without
imperilling
the
happiness
of
his
child
he
knew
no
other
young
man
so
well
adapted
as
frederick
through
the
influence
of
dambreuse
he
could
obtain
the
title
of
his
maternal
grandfather
madame
moreau
being
the
daughter
of
a
comte
de
fouvens
and
besides
being
connected
with
the
oldest
families
in
champagne
the
lavernades
and
the
as
for
the
moreaus
a
gothic
inscription
near
the
mills
of
referred
to
one
jacob
moreau
who
had
rebuilt
them
in
and
the
tomb
of
his
own
son
pierre
moreau
first
esquire
of
the
king
under
louis
was
to
be
seen
in
the
chapel
of
so
much
family
distinction
fascinated
roque
the
son
of
an
old
servant
if
the
coronet
of
a
count
did
not
come
he
would
console
himself
with
something
else
for
frederick
might
get
a
deputyship
when
dambreuse
had
been
raised
to
the
peerage
and
might
then
be
able
to
assist
him
in
his
commercial
pursuits
and
to
obtain
for
him
supplies
and
grants
he
liked
the
young
man
personally
in
short
he
desired
to
have
frederick
for
a
because
for
a
long
time
past
he
had
been
smitten
with
this
notion
which
only
grew
all
the
stronger
day
by
day
now
he
went
to
religious
services
and
he
had
won
madame
moreau
over
to
his
views
especially
by
holding
before
her
the
prospect
of
a
title
so
it
was
that
eight
days
later
without
any
formal
engagement
frederick
was
regarded
as
mademoiselle
roque
intended
and
père
roque
who
was
not
troubled
with
many
scruples
often
left
them
together
chapter
xii
little
louise
grows
up
deslauriers
had
carried
away
from
frederick
house
the
copy
of
the
deed
of
subrogation
with
a
power
of
attorney
in
proper
form
giving
him
full
authority
to
act
but
when
he
had
reascended
his
own
five
flights
of
stairs
and
found
himself
alone
in
the
midst
of
his
dismal
room
in
his
armchair
upholstered
in
the
sight
of
the
stamped
paper
disgusted
him
he
was
tired
of
these
things
and
of
restaurants
at
sous
of
travelling
in
omnibuses
of
enduring
want
and
making
futile
efforts
he
took
up
the
papers
again
there
were
others
near
them
they
were
prospectuses
of
the
company
with
a
list
of
the
mines
and
the
particulars
as
to
their
contents
frederick
having
left
all
these
matters
in
his
hands
in
order
to
have
his
opinion
about
them
an
idea
occurred
to
him
that
of
presenting
himself
at
house
and
applying
for
the
post
of
secretary
this
post
it
was
perfectly
certain
could
not
be
obtained
without
purchasing
a
certain
number
of
shares
he
recognised
the
folly
of
his
project
and
said
to
himself
oh
no
that
would
be
a
wrong
step
then
he
ransacked
his
brains
to
think
of
the
best
way
in
which
he
could
set
about
recovering
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
such
a
sum
was
a
mere
trifle
to
frederick
but
if
he
had
it
what
a
lever
it
would
be
in
his
hands
and
the
was
indignant
at
the
other
being
so
well
off
he
makes
a
pitiful
use
of
it
he
is
a
selfish
fellow
ah
what
do
i
care
for
his
fifteen
thousand
francs
why
had
he
lent
the
money
for
the
sake
of
madame
arnoux
bright
eyes
she
was
his
mistress
deslauriers
had
no
doubt
about
it
there
was
another
way
in
which
money
was
useful
and
he
was
assailed
by
malignant
thoughts
then
he
allowed
his
thoughts
to
dwell
even
on
frederick
personal
appearance
it
had
always
exercised
over
him
an
almost
feminine
charm
and
he
soon
came
to
admire
it
for
a
success
which
he
realised
that
he
was
himself
incapable
of
achieving
nevertheless
was
not
the
will
the
main
element
in
every
enterprise
and
since
by
its
means
we
may
triumph
over
everything
ha
that
would
be
funny
but
he
felt
ashamed
of
such
treachery
and
the
next
moment
pooh
i
am
afraid
madame
arnoux
from
having
heard
her
spoken
about
so
often
had
come
to
be
depicted
in
his
imagination
as
something
extraordinary
the
persistency
of
this
passion
had
irritated
him
like
a
problem
her
austerity
which
seemed
a
little
theatrical
now
annoyed
him
besides
the
woman
of
the
world
or
rather
his
own
conception
of
her
dazzled
the
advocate
as
a
symbol
and
the
epitome
of
a
thousand
pleasures
poor
though
he
was
he
hankered
after
luxury
in
its
more
glittering
form
after
all
even
though
he
should
get
angry
so
much
the
worse
he
has
behaved
too
badly
to
me
to
call
for
any
anxiety
about
him
on
my
part
i
have
no
assurance
that
she
is
his
mistress
he
has
denied
it
so
then
i
am
free
to
act
as
i
please
he
could
no
longer
abandon
the
desire
of
taking
this
step
he
wished
to
make
a
trial
of
his
own
strength
so
that
one
day
all
of
a
sudden
he
polished
his
boots
himself
bought
white
gloves
and
set
forth
on
his
way
substituting
himself
for
frederick
and
almost
imagining
that
he
was
the
other
by
a
singular
intellectual
evolution
in
which
there
was
at
the
same
time
vengeance
and
sympathy
imitation
and
audacity
he
announced
himself
as
doctor
deslauriers
madame
arnoux
was
surprised
as
she
had
not
sent
for
any
physician
ha
a
thousand
apologies
is
a
doctor
of
law
i
have
come
in
monsieur
moreau
interest
this
name
appeared
to
produce
a
disquieting
effect
on
her
mind
so
much
the
better
thought
the
since
she
has
a
liking
for
him
she
will
like
me
too
buoying
up
his
courage
with
the
accepted
idea
that
it
is
easier
to
supplant
a
lover
than
a
husband
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
on
one
occasion
at
the
he
even
mentioned
the
date
this
remarkable
power
of
memory
astonished
madame
arnoux
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
mild
affectation
you
have
already
found
your
affairs
a
little
embarrassing
she
made
no
reply
then
it
must
be
true
he
began
to
chat
about
one
thing
or
another
about
her
house
about
the
works
then
noticing
some
medallions
at
the
sides
of
the
mirror
ha
family
portraits
no
doubt
he
remarked
that
of
an
old
lady
madame
arnoux
mother
she
has
the
appearance
of
an
excellent
woman
a
southern
type
and
on
being
met
with
the
objection
that
she
was
from
chartres
chartres
pretty
town
he
praised
its
cathedral
and
public
buildings
and
coming
back
to
the
portrait
traced
resemblances
between
it
and
madame
arnoux
and
cast
flatteries
at
her
indirectly
she
did
not
appear
to
be
offended
at
this
he
took
confidence
and
said
that
he
had
known
arnoux
a
long
time
he
is
a
fine
fellow
but
one
who
compromises
himself
take
this
mortgage
for
example
one
ca
imagine
such
a
reckless
act
yes
i
know
said
she
shrugging
her
shoulders
this
involuntary
evidence
of
contempt
induced
deslauriers
to
continue
that
kaolin
business
of
his
was
near
turning
out
very
badly
a
thing
you
may
not
be
aware
of
and
even
his
reputation
a
contraction
of
the
brows
made
him
pause
then
falling
back
on
generalities
he
expressed
his
pity
for
the
poor
women
whose
husbands
frittered
away
their
means
but
in
this
case
monsieur
the
means
belong
to
him
as
for
me
i
have
nothing
no
matter
one
never
knows
a
woman
of
experience
might
be
useful
he
made
offers
of
devotion
exalted
his
own
merits
and
he
looked
into
her
face
through
his
shining
spectacles
she
was
seized
with
a
vague
torpor
but
suddenly
said
let
us
look
into
the
matter
i
beg
of
you
he
exhibited
the
bundle
of
papers
this
is
frederick
letter
of
attorney
with
such
a
document
in
the
hands
of
a
who
would
make
out
an
order
nothing
could
be
easier
in
hours
she
remained
impassive
he
changed
his
manoeuvre
as
for
me
however
i
do
understand
what
impels
him
to
demand
this
sum
for
in
fact
he
does
want
it
how
is
that
monsieur
moreau
has
shown
himself
so
kind
oh
granted
and
deslauriers
began
by
eulogising
him
then
in
a
mild
fashion
disparaged
him
giving
it
out
that
he
was
a
forgetful
individual
and
of
money
i
thought
he
was
your
friend
monsieur
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
seeing
his
defects
thus
he
showed
very
little
recognition
of
how
shall
i
put
it
the
sympathy
madame
arnoux
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
large
manuscript
book
she
interrupted
him
in
order
to
get
him
to
explain
a
certain
word
he
bent
over
her
shoulder
and
his
face
came
so
close
to
hers
that
he
grazed
her
cheek
she
blushed
this
heightened
colour
inflamed
deslauriers
he
hungrily
kissed
her
head
what
are
you
doing
monsieur
and
standing
up
against
the
wall
she
compelled
him
to
remain
perfectly
quiet
under
the
glance
of
her
large
blue
eyes
glowing
with
anger
listen
to
me
i
love
you
she
broke
into
a
laugh
a
shrill
discouraging
laugh
deslauriers
felt
himself
suffocating
with
anger
he
restrained
his
feelings
and
with
the
look
of
a
vanquished
person
imploring
mercy
ha
you
are
wrong
as
for
me
i
would
not
go
like
him
of
whom
pray
are
you
talking
of
frederick
ah
monsieur
moreau
troubles
me
little
i
told
you
that
oh
forgive
me
forgive
me
then
drawling
his
words
in
a
sarcastic
tone
i
even
imagined
that
you
were
sufficiently
interested
in
him
personally
to
learn
with
pleasure
she
became
quite
pale
the
added
he
is
going
to
be
married
he
in
a
month
at
latest
to
mademoiselle
roque
the
daughter
of
dambreuse
agent
he
has
even
gone
down
to
nogent
for
no
other
purpose
but
that
she
placed
her
hand
over
her
heart
as
if
at
the
shock
of
a
great
blow
but
immediately
she
rang
the
bell
deslauriers
did
not
wait
to
be
ordered
to
leave
when
she
turned
round
he
had
disappeared
madame
arnoux
was
gasping
a
little
with
the
strain
of
her
emotions
she
drew
near
the
window
to
get
a
breath
of
air
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
on
the
footpath
a
packer
in
his
was
nailing
down
a
trunk
passed
she
closed
the
and
then
came
and
sat
down
as
the
high
houses
in
the
vicinity
intercepted
the
sun
rays
the
light
of
day
stole
coldly
into
the
apartment
her
children
had
gone
out
there
was
not
a
stir
around
her
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
utterly
deserted
he
is
going
to
be
married
is
it
possible
and
she
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
nervous
trembling
why
is
this
does
it
mean
that
i
love
him
then
all
of
a
sudden
why
yes
i
love
him
i
love
him
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
sinking
into
endless
depths
the
clock
struck
three
she
listened
to
the
vibrations
of
the
sounds
as
they
died
away
and
she
remained
on
the
edge
of
the
armchair
with
her
eyeballs
fixed
and
an
unchanging
smile
on
her
face
the
same
afternoon
at
the
same
moment
frederick
and
mademoiselle
louise
were
walking
in
the
garden
belonging
to
roque
at
the
end
of
the
island
old
catherine
was
watching
them
some
distance
away
they
were
walking
side
by
side
and
frederick
said
you
remember
when
i
brought
you
into
the
country
how
good
you
were
to
me
she
replied
you
assisted
me
in
making
in
filling
my
and
in
rocking
me
in
the
swing
all
your
dolls
who
had
the
names
of
queens
and
marchionesses
what
has
become
of
them
really
i
do
know
and
your
pug
moricaud
he
drowned
poor
darling
and
the
of
which
we
coloured
the
engravings
together
i
have
it
still
he
recalled
to
her
mind
the
day
of
her
first
communion
and
how
pretty
she
had
been
at
vespers
with
her
white
veil
and
her
large
whilst
the
girls
were
all
taking
their
places
in
a
row
around
the
choir
and
the
bell
was
tinkling
these
memories
no
doubt
had
little
charm
for
mademoiselle
roque
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
and
a
minute
later
naughty
fellow
never
to
have
written
a
line
to
me
even
once
frederick
urged
by
way
of
excuse
his
numerous
occupations
what
then
are
you
doing
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
question
then
he
told
her
that
he
was
studying
politics
ha
and
without
questioning
him
further
that
gives
you
occupation
while
as
for
me
then
she
spoke
to
him
about
the
barrenness
of
her
existence
as
there
was
nobody
she
could
go
to
see
and
nothing
to
amuse
her
or
distract
her
thoughts
she
wished
to
go
on
horseback
the
vicar
maintains
that
this
is
improper
for
a
young
lady
how
stupid
these
proprieties
are
long
ago
they
allowed
me
to
do
whatever
i
pleased
now
they
wo
let
me
do
anything
your
father
however
is
fond
of
you
yes
but
she
heaved
a
sigh
which
meant
that
is
not
enough
to
make
me
happy
then
there
was
silence
they
heard
only
the
noise
made
by
their
boots
in
the
sand
together
with
the
murmur
of
falling
water
for
the
seine
above
nogent
is
cut
into
two
arms
that
which
turns
the
mills
discharges
in
this
place
the
superabundance
of
its
waves
in
order
to
unite
further
down
with
the
natural
course
of
the
stream
and
a
person
coming
from
the
bridge
could
see
at
the
right
on
the
other
bank
of
the
river
a
grassy
slope
on
which
a
white
house
looked
down
at
the
left
in
the
meadow
a
row
of
extended
and
the
horizon
in
front
was
bounded
by
a
curve
of
the
river
it
was
flat
like
a
mirror
large
insects
hovered
over
the
noiseless
water
tufts
of
reeds
and
rushes
bordered
it
unevenly
all
kinds
of
plants
which
happened
to
spring
up
there
bloomed
out
in
buttercups
caused
yellow
clusters
to
hang
down
raised
trees
in
with
and
made
green
rockets
spring
up
at
random
in
an
inlet
of
the
river
white
displayed
themselves
and
a
row
of
ancient
willows
in
which
were
hidden
formed
on
that
side
of
the
island
the
sole
protection
of
the
garden
in
the
interior
on
this
side
four
walls
with
a
slate
coping
enclosed
the
in
which
the
square
patches
recently
dug
up
looked
like
brown
plates
the
of
the
melons
shone
in
a
row
on
the
narrow
hotbed
the
artichokes
the
the
spinach
the
carrots
and
the
tomatoes
succeeded
each
other
till
one
reached
a
background
where
asparagus
grew
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
resembled
a
little
wood
of
feathers
all
this
piece
of
land
had
been
under
the
directory
what
is
called
a
folly
the
trees
had
since
then
grown
enormously
clematis
obstructed
the
hornbeams
the
walks
were
covered
with
moss
brambles
abounded
on
every
side
fragments
of
statues
let
their
plaster
crumble
in
the
grass
the
feet
of
anyone
walking
through
the
place
got
entangled
in
work
there
now
remained
of
the
pavilion
only
two
apartments
on
the
ground
floor
with
some
blue
paper
hanging
in
shreds
before
the
façade
extended
an
arbour
in
the
italian
style
in
which
a
was
supported
on
columns
of
brick
by
a
of
sticks
soon
they
arrived
at
this
spot
and
as
the
light
fell
through
the
irregular
gaps
on
the
green
herbage
frederick
turning
his
head
on
one
side
to
speak
to
louise
noticed
the
shadow
of
the
leaves
on
her
face
she
had
in
her
red
hair
stuck
in
her
chignon
a
needle
terminated
by
a
glass
bell
in
imitation
of
emerald
and
in
spite
of
her
mourning
she
wore
so
artless
was
her
bad
taste
straw
slippers
trimmed
with
pink
satin
a
vulgar
curiosity
probably
bought
at
some
fair
he
remarked
this
and
ironically
congratulated
her
do
be
laughing
at
me
she
replied
then
surveying
him
altogether
from
his
grey
felt
hat
to
his
silk
stockings
what
an
exquisite
you
are
after
this
she
asked
him
to
mention
some
works
which
she
could
read
he
gave
her
the
names
of
several
and
she
said
oh
how
learned
you
are
while
yet
very
small
she
had
been
smitten
with
one
of
those
childish
passions
which
have
at
the
same
time
the
purity
of
a
religion
and
the
violence
of
a
natural
instinct
he
had
been
her
comrade
her
brother
her
master
had
diverted
her
mind
made
her
heart
beat
more
quickly
and
without
any
desire
for
such
a
result
had
poured
out
into
the
very
depths
of
her
being
a
latent
and
continuous
intoxication
then
he
had
parted
with
her
at
the
moment
of
a
tragic
crisis
in
her
existence
when
her
mother
had
only
just
died
and
these
two
separations
had
been
mingled
together
absence
had
idealised
him
in
her
memory
he
had
come
back
with
a
sort
of
halo
round
his
head
and
she
gave
herself
up
ingenuously
to
the
feelings
of
bliss
she
experienced
at
seeing
him
once
more
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
frederick
felt
himself
beloved
and
this
new
pleasure
which
did
not
transcend
the
ordinary
run
of
agreeable
sensations
made
his
breast
swell
with
so
much
emotion
that
he
spread
out
his
two
arms
while
he
flung
back
his
head
a
large
cloud
passed
across
the
sky
it
is
going
towards
paris
said
louise
you
like
to
follow
it
would
you
i
why
who
knows
and
surveying
him
with
a
sharp
look
perhaps
you
have
there
she
searched
her
mind
for
the
appropriate
phrase
something
to
engage
your
affections
oh
i
have
nothing
to
engage
my
affections
there
are
you
perfectly
certain
why
yes
mademoiselle
perfectly
certain
in
less
than
a
year
there
had
taken
place
in
the
young
girl
an
extraordinary
transformation
which
astonished
frederick
after
a
minute
silence
he
added
we
ought
to
and
each
other
as
we
used
to
do
long
ago
shall
we
do
so
no
why
because
he
persisted
she
answered
with
downcast
face
i
dare
not
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
garden
which
was
close
to
the
frederick
in
a
spirit
of
boyish
fun
began
to
send
pebbles
skimming
over
the
water
she
bade
him
sit
down
he
obeyed
then
looking
at
the
waterfall
is
like
niagara
he
began
talking
about
distant
countries
and
long
voyages
the
idea
of
making
some
herself
exercised
a
fascination
over
her
mind
she
would
not
have
been
afraid
either
of
tempests
or
of
lions
seated
close
beside
each
other
they
collected
in
front
of
them
handfuls
of
sand
then
while
they
were
chatting
they
let
it
slip
through
their
fingers
and
the
hot
wind
which
rose
from
the
plains
carried
to
them
in
puffs
odours
of
lavender
together
with
the
smell
of
tar
escaping
from
a
boat
behind
the
lock
the
sun
rays
fell
on
the
cascade
the
greenish
blocks
of
stone
in
the
little
wall
over
which
the
water
slipped
looked
as
if
they
were
covered
with
a
silver
gauze
that
was
perpetually
rolling
itself
out
a
long
strip
of
foam
gushed
forth
at
the
foot
with
a
harmonious
murmur
then
it
bubbled
up
forming
whirlpools
and
a
thousand
opposing
currents
which
ended
by
intermingling
in
a
single
limpid
stream
of
water
louise
said
in
a
musing
tone
that
she
envied
the
existence
of
fishes
it
must
be
so
delightful
to
tumble
about
down
there
at
your
ease
and
to
feel
yourself
caressed
on
every
side
illustration
illustration
can
i
live
without
you
she
shivered
with
sensuously
enticing
movements
but
a
voice
exclaimed
where
are
you
your
maid
is
calling
you
said
frederick
all
right
all
right
louise
did
not
disturb
herself
she
will
be
angry
he
suggested
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
and
besides
mademoiselle
roque
gave
him
to
understand
by
a
gesture
that
the
girl
was
entirely
subject
to
her
will
she
arose
however
and
then
complained
of
a
headache
and
as
they
were
passing
in
front
of
a
large
containing
some
faggots
suppose
we
sat
down
there
he
pretended
not
to
understand
this
dialectic
expression
and
even
teased
her
about
her
accent
gradually
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
compressed
she
bit
her
lips
she
stepped
aside
in
order
to
sulk
frederick
came
over
to
her
swore
he
did
not
mean
to
annoy
her
and
that
he
was
very
fond
of
her
is
that
true
she
exclaimed
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
which
lighted
up
her
entire
face
smeared
over
a
little
with
patches
of
bran
he
could
not
resist
the
sentiment
of
gallantry
which
was
aroused
in
him
by
her
fresh
youthfulness
and
he
replied
why
should
i
tell
you
a
lie
have
you
any
doubt
about
it
eh
and
as
he
spoke
he
passed
his
left
hand
round
her
waist
a
cry
soft
as
the
cooing
of
a
dove
leaped
up
from
her
throat
her
head
fell
back
she
was
going
to
faint
when
he
held
her
up
and
his
virtuous
scruples
were
futile
at
the
sight
of
this
maiden
offering
herself
to
him
he
was
seized
with
fear
he
assisted
her
to
take
a
few
steps
slowly
he
had
ceased
to
address
her
in
soothing
words
and
no
longer
caring
to
talk
of
anything
save
the
most
trifling
subjects
he
spoke
to
her
about
some
of
the
principal
figures
in
the
society
of
nogent
suddenly
she
repelled
him
and
in
a
bitter
tone
you
would
not
have
the
courage
to
run
away
with
me
he
remained
motionless
with
a
look
of
utter
amazement
in
his
face
she
burst
into
sobs
and
hiding
her
face
in
his
breast
can
i
live
without
you
he
tried
to
calm
her
emotion
she
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulders
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
his
face
and
fixing
her
green
eyes
on
his
with
an
almost
fierce
tearfulness
will
you
be
my
husband
but
frederick
began
casting
about
in
his
inner
consciousness
for
a
reply
of
course
i
ask
for
nothing
better
at
that
moment
roque
cap
appeared
behind
a
he
brought
his
young
friend
on
a
trip
through
the
district
in
order
to
show
off
his
property
and
when
frederick
returned
after
two
absence
he
found
three
letters
awaiting
him
at
his
mother
house
the
first
was
a
note
from
dambreuse
containing
an
invitation
to
dinner
for
the
previous
tuesday
what
was
the
occasion
of
this
politeness
so
then
they
had
forgiven
his
prank
the
second
was
from
rosanette
she
thanked
him
for
having
risked
his
life
on
her
behalf
frederick
did
not
at
first
understand
what
she
meant
finally
after
a
considerable
amount
of
circumlocution
while
appealing
to
his
friendship
relying
on
his
delicacy
as
she
put
it
and
going
on
her
knees
to
him
on
account
of
the
pressing
necessity
of
the
case
as
she
wanted
bread
she
asked
him
for
a
loan
of
five
hundred
francs
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
to
supply
her
with
the
amount
the
third
letter
which
was
from
deslauriers
spoke
of
the
letter
of
attorney
and
was
long
and
obscure
the
advocate
had
not
yet
taken
any
definite
action
he
urged
his
friend
not
to
disturb
himself
is
useless
for
you
to
come
back
even
laying
singular
stress
on
this
point
frederick
got
lost
in
conjectures
of
every
sort
and
he
felt
anxious
to
return
to
paris
this
assumption
of
a
right
to
control
his
conduct
excited
in
him
a
feeling
of
revolt
moreover
he
began
to
experience
that
nostalgia
of
the
boulevard
and
then
his
mother
was
pressing
him
so
much
roque
kept
revolving
about
him
so
constantly
and
mademoiselle
louise
was
so
much
attached
to
him
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
avoid
speedily
declaring
his
intentions
he
wanted
to
think
and
he
would
be
better
able
to
form
a
right
estimate
of
things
at
a
distance
in
order
to
assign
a
motive
for
his
journey
frederick
invented
a
story
and
he
left
home
telling
everyone
and
himself
believing
that
he
would
soon
return
chapter
xiii
rosanette
as
a
lovely
turk
his
return
to
paris
gave
him
no
pleasure
it
was
an
evening
at
the
close
of
august
the
boulevards
seemed
empty
the
succeeded
each
other
with
scowling
faces
here
and
there
a
boiler
of
asphalt
was
smoking
several
houses
had
their
blinds
entirely
drawn
he
made
his
way
to
his
own
residence
in
the
city
he
found
the
hangings
covered
with
dust
and
while
dining
all
alone
frederick
was
seized
with
a
strange
feeling
of
forlornness
then
his
thoughts
reverted
to
mademoiselle
roque
the
idea
of
being
married
no
longer
appeared
to
him
preposterous
they
might
travel
they
might
go
to
italy
to
the
east
and
he
saw
her
standing
on
a
hillock
or
gazing
at
a
landscape
or
else
leaning
on
his
arm
in
a
florentine
gallery
while
she
stood
to
look
at
the
pictures
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
him
merely
to
watch
this
good
little
creature
expanding
under
the
splendours
of
art
and
nature
when
she
had
got
free
from
the
commonplace
atmosphere
in
which
she
had
lived
she
would
in
a
little
while
become
a
charming
companion
wealth
moreover
tempted
him
and
yet
he
shrank
from
taking
this
step
regarding
it
as
a
weakness
a
degradation
but
he
was
firmly
resolved
whatever
he
might
do
on
changing
his
mode
of
life
that
is
to
say
to
lose
his
heart
no
more
in
fruitless
passions
and
he
even
hesitated
about
executing
the
commission
with
which
he
had
been
intrusted
by
louise
this
was
to
buy
for
her
at
jacques
arnoux
establishment
two
statues
of
many
colours
representing
negroes
like
those
which
were
at
the
prefecture
at
troyes
she
knew
the
manufacturer
number
and
would
not
have
any
other
frederick
was
afraid
that
if
he
went
back
to
their
house
he
might
once
again
fall
a
victim
to
his
old
passion
these
reflections
occupied
his
mind
during
the
entire
evening
and
he
was
just
about
to
go
to
bed
when
a
woman
presented
herself
is
i
said
mademoiselle
vatnaz
with
a
laugh
i
have
come
in
behalf
of
rosanette
so
then
they
were
reconciled
good
heavens
yes
i
am
not
as
you
are
well
aware
and
besides
the
poor
girl
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
all
about
it
in
short
the
maréchale
wanted
to
see
him
she
was
waiting
for
an
answer
her
letter
having
travelled
from
paris
to
nogent
mademoiselle
vatnaz
did
not
know
what
was
in
it
then
frederick
asked
her
how
the
maréchale
was
going
on
he
was
informed
that
she
was
now
a
very
rich
man
a
russian
prince
tzernoukoff
who
had
seen
her
at
the
races
in
the
champ
de
mars
last
summer
he
has
three
carriages
a
livery
servants
a
groom
got
up
in
the
english
fashion
a
a
box
at
the
italian
opera
and
a
heap
of
other
things
there
you
are
my
dear
friend
and
the
vatnaz
as
if
she
had
profited
by
this
change
of
fortune
appeared
gayer
and
happier
she
took
off
her
gloves
and
examined
the
furniture
and
the
objects
of
virtù
in
the
room
she
mentioned
their
exact
prices
like
a
dealer
he
ought
to
have
consulted
her
in
order
to
get
them
cheaper
then
she
congratulated
him
on
his
good
taste
ha
this
is
pretty
exceedingly
nice
there
nobody
like
you
for
these
ideas
the
next
moment
as
her
eyes
fell
on
a
door
close
to
the
pillar
of
the
alcove
that
the
way
you
let
your
friends
out
eh
and
in
a
familiar
fashion
she
laid
her
finger
on
his
chin
he
trembled
at
the
contact
of
her
long
hands
at
the
same
time
thin
and
soft
round
her
wrists
she
wore
an
edging
of
lace
and
on
the
body
of
her
green
dress
lace
embroidery
like
a
hussar
her
bonnet
of
black
tulle
with
borders
hanging
down
concealed
her
forehead
a
little
her
eyes
shone
underneath
an
odour
of
patchouli
escaped
from
her
the
placed
on
a
round
table
shining
down
on
her
like
the
footlights
of
a
theatre
made
her
jaw
protrude
she
said
to
him
in
an
unctuous
tone
while
she
drew
forth
from
her
purse
three
square
slips
of
paper
you
will
take
these
from
me
they
were
three
tickets
for
delmar
benefit
performance
what
for
him
certainly
mademoiselle
vatnaz
without
giving
a
further
explanation
added
that
she
adored
him
more
than
ever
if
she
were
to
be
believed
the
comedian
was
now
definitely
classed
amongst
the
leading
celebrities
of
the
age
and
it
was
not
such
or
such
a
personage
that
he
represented
but
the
very
genius
of
france
the
people
he
had
the
humanitarian
spirit
he
understood
the
priesthood
of
art
frederick
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
these
eulogies
gave
her
the
money
for
the
three
seats
you
need
not
say
a
word
about
this
over
the
way
how
late
it
is
good
heavens
i
must
leave
you
ah
i
was
forgetting
the
address
is
the
rue
number
and
at
the
door
beloved
man
beloved
by
whom
asked
frederick
what
a
strange
woman
and
he
remembered
that
dussardier
had
said
to
him
one
day
when
talking
about
her
oh
she
not
much
as
if
alluding
to
stories
of
a
by
no
means
edifying
character
next
morning
he
repaired
to
the
maréchale
abode
she
lived
in
a
new
house
the
blinds
of
which
projected
into
the
street
at
the
head
of
each
flight
of
stairs
there
was
a
mirror
against
the
wall
before
each
window
there
was
a
and
all
over
the
steps
extended
a
carpet
of
and
when
one
got
inside
the
door
the
coolness
of
the
staircase
was
refreshing
it
was
a
who
came
to
open
the
door
a
footman
in
a
red
waistcoat
on
a
bench
in
the
anteroom
a
woman
and
two
men
tradespeople
no
doubt
were
waiting
as
if
in
a
minister
vestibule
at
the
left
the
door
of
the
slightly
ajar
afforded
a
glimpse
of
empty
bottles
on
the
sideboards
and
napkins
on
the
backs
of
chairs
and
parallel
with
it
ran
a
corridor
in
which
sticks
supported
an
espalier
of
roses
in
the
courtyard
below
two
boys
with
bare
arms
were
scrubbing
a
landau
their
voices
rose
to
frederick
ears
mingled
with
the
intermittent
sounds
made
by
a
currycomb
knocking
against
a
stone
the
returned
madame
will
receive
monsieur
and
he
led
frederick
through
a
second
anteroom
and
then
into
a
large
hung
with
yellow
brocatel
with
twisted
fringes
at
the
corners
which
were
joined
at
the
ceiling
and
which
seemed
to
be
continued
by
flowerings
of
lustre
resembling
cables
no
doubt
there
had
been
an
entertainment
there
the
night
before
some
had
been
allowed
to
remain
on
the
at
last
he
found
his
way
into
a
kind
of
boudoir
with
windows
through
which
the
sun
shed
a
dim
light
trefoils
of
carved
wood
adorned
the
upper
portions
of
the
doors
behind
a
balustrade
three
purple
mattresses
formed
a
divan
and
the
stem
of
a
narghileh
made
of
platinum
lay
on
top
of
it
instead
of
a
mirror
there
was
on
the
mantelpiece
a
whatnot
displaying
on
its
shelves
an
entire
collection
of
curiosities
old
silver
trumpets
bohemian
horns
jewelled
clasps
jade
studs
enamels
grotesque
figures
in
china
and
a
little
byzantine
virgin
with
a
vermilion
ape
and
all
this
was
mingled
in
a
golden
twilight
with
the
bluish
shade
of
the
carpet
the
reflections
of
the
and
the
tawny
hue
of
the
walls
covered
with
maroon
leather
in
the
corners
on
little
pedestals
there
were
bronze
vases
containing
clusters
of
flowers
which
made
the
atmosphere
heavy
rosanette
presented
herself
attired
in
a
pink
satin
vest
with
white
cashmere
trousers
a
necklace
of
piasters
and
a
red
cap
encircled
with
a
branch
of
jasmine
frederick
started
back
in
surprise
then
said
he
had
brought
the
thing
she
had
been
speaking
about
and
he
handed
her
the
she
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
and
as
he
still
kept
the
note
in
his
hand
without
knowing
where
to
put
it
pray
take
it
she
seized
it
then
as
she
flung
it
on
the
divan
you
are
very
kind
she
wanted
it
to
meet
the
rent
of
a
piece
of
ground
at
bellevue
which
she
paid
in
this
way
every
year
her
unceremoniousness
wounded
frederick
sensibility
however
so
much
the
better
this
would
avenge
him
for
the
past
sit
down
said
she
there
closer
and
in
a
grave
tone
in
the
first
place
i
have
to
thank
you
my
dear
friend
for
having
risked
your
life
oh
that
nothing
what
why
is
a
very
noble
act
and
the
maréchale
exhibited
an
embarrassing
sense
of
gratitude
for
it
must
have
been
impressed
upon
her
mind
that
the
duel
was
entirely
on
account
of
arnoux
as
the
latter
who
believed
it
himself
was
not
likely
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
telling
her
so
she
is
laughing
at
me
perhaps
thought
frederick
he
had
nothing
further
to
detain
him
and
pleading
that
he
had
an
appointment
he
rose
oh
no
stay
he
resumed
his
seat
and
presently
complimented
her
on
her
costume
she
replied
with
an
air
of
dejection
is
the
prince
who
likes
me
to
dress
in
this
fashion
and
one
must
smoke
such
machines
as
that
too
rosanette
added
pointing
towards
the
narghileh
suppose
we
try
the
taste
of
it
have
you
any
objection
she
procured
a
light
and
finding
it
hard
to
set
fire
to
the
tobacco
she
began
to
stamp
impatiently
with
her
foot
then
a
feeling
of
languor
took
possession
of
her
and
she
remained
motionless
on
the
divan
with
a
cushion
under
her
arm
and
her
body
twisted
a
little
on
one
side
one
knee
bent
and
the
other
leg
straight
out
the
long
serpent
of
red
morocco
which
formed
rings
on
the
floor
rolled
itself
over
her
arm
she
rested
the
amber
mouthpiece
on
her
lips
and
gazed
at
frederick
while
she
blinked
her
eyes
in
the
midst
of
the
cloud
of
smoke
that
enveloped
her
a
gurgling
sound
came
from
her
throat
as
she
inhaled
the
fumes
and
from
time
to
time
she
murmured
the
poor
darling
the
poor
pet
he
tried
to
find
something
of
an
agreeable
nature
to
talk
about
the
thought
of
vatnaz
recurred
to
his
memory
he
remarked
that
she
appeared
to
him
very
yes
upon
my
word
replied
the
maréchale
she
is
very
lucky
in
having
me
that
same
lady
without
adding
another
word
so
much
reserve
was
there
in
their
conversation
each
of
them
felt
a
sense
of
constraint
something
that
formed
a
barrier
to
confidential
relations
between
them
in
fact
rosanette
vanity
had
been
flattered
by
the
duel
of
which
she
believed
herself
to
be
the
occasion
then
she
was
very
much
astonished
that
he
did
not
hasten
to
take
advantage
of
his
achievement
and
in
order
to
compel
him
to
return
to
her
she
had
invented
this
story
that
she
wanted
five
hundred
francs
how
was
it
that
frederick
did
not
ask
for
a
little
love
from
her
in
return
this
was
a
piece
of
refinement
that
filled
her
with
amazement
and
with
a
gush
of
emotion
she
said
to
him
will
you
come
with
us
to
the
what
does
mean
myself
and
my
bird
i
make
you
pass
for
a
cousin
of
mine
as
in
the
old
comedies
a
thousand
thanks
well
then
you
will
take
lodgings
near
ours
the
idea
of
hiding
himself
from
a
rich
man
humiliated
him
no
that
is
impossible
just
as
you
please
rosanette
turned
away
with
tears
in
her
eyes
frederick
noticed
this
and
in
order
to
testify
the
interest
which
he
took
in
her
he
said
that
he
was
delighted
to
see
her
at
last
in
a
comfortable
position
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
then
was
troubling
her
was
it
perchance
that
she
was
not
loved
oh
as
for
me
i
have
always
people
to
love
me
she
added
it
remains
to
be
seen
in
what
way
complaining
that
she
was
suffocating
with
the
heat
the
maréchale
unfastened
her
vest
and
without
any
other
garment
round
her
body
save
her
silk
chemise
she
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
so
as
to
awaken
his
tenderness
a
man
of
less
introspective
egoism
would
not
have
bestowed
a
thought
at
such
a
moment
on
the
possibility
of
the
vicomte
de
comaing
or
anyone
else
appearing
on
the
scene
but
frederick
had
been
too
many
times
the
dupe
of
these
very
glances
to
compromise
himself
by
a
fresh
humiliation
she
wished
to
know
all
about
his
relationships
and
his
amusements
she
even
enquired
about
his
financial
affairs
and
offered
to
lend
him
money
if
he
wanted
it
frederick
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
took
up
his
hat
i
off
my
pet
i
hope
you
enjoy
yourself
thoroughly
down
there
revoir
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
then
in
a
dry
tone
revoir
he
made
his
way
out
through
the
yellow
and
through
the
second
anteroom
there
was
on
the
table
between
a
vase
full
of
and
an
inkstand
a
chased
silver
chest
it
was
madame
arnoux
then
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
at
the
same
time
as
it
were
the
scandal
of
a
profanation
he
felt
a
longing
to
raise
his
hands
towards
it
and
to
open
it
he
was
afraid
of
being
seen
and
went
away
frederick
was
virtuous
he
did
not
go
back
to
the
arnouxs
house
he
sent
his
to
buy
the
two
negroes
having
given
him
all
the
necessary
directions
and
the
case
containing
them
set
forth
the
same
evening
for
nogent
next
morning
as
he
was
repairing
to
lodgings
at
the
turn
where
the
rue
vivienne
opened
out
on
the
boulevard
madame
arnoux
presented
herself
before
him
face
to
face
the
first
movement
of
each
of
them
was
to
draw
back
then
the
same
smile
came
to
the
lips
of
both
and
they
advanced
to
meet
each
other
for
a
minute
neither
of
them
uttered
a
single
word
the
sunlight
fell
round
her
and
her
oval
face
her
long
eyelashes
her
black
lace
shawl
which
showed
the
outline
of
her
shoulders
her
gown
of
shot
silk
the
bouquet
of
violets
at
the
corner
of
her
bonnet
all
seemed
to
him
to
possess
extraordinary
magnificence
an
infinite
softness
poured
itself
out
of
her
beautiful
eyes
and
in
a
faltering
voice
uttering
at
random
the
first
words
that
came
to
his
lips
how
is
arnoux
well
i
thank
you
and
your
children
they
are
very
well
ah
ah
what
fine
weather
we
are
getting
are
we
not
splendid
indeed
you
going
out
shopping
and
with
a
slow
inclination
of
the
head
she
put
out
her
hand
without
having
spoken
one
word
of
an
affectionate
description
and
did
not
even
invite
him
to
dinner
at
her
house
no
matter
he
would
not
have
given
this
interview
for
the
most
delightful
of
adventures
and
he
pondered
over
its
sweetness
as
he
proceeded
on
his
way
deslauriers
surprised
at
seeing
him
dissembled
his
spite
for
he
cherished
still
through
obstinacy
some
hope
with
regard
to
madame
arnoux
and
he
had
written
to
frederick
to
prolong
his
stay
in
the
country
in
order
to
be
free
in
his
manoeuvres
he
informed
frederick
however
that
he
had
presented
himself
at
her
house
in
order
to
ascertain
if
their
contract
stipulated
for
a
community
of
property
between
husband
and
wife
in
that
case
proceedings
might
be
taken
against
the
wife
and
she
put
on
a
queer
face
when
i
told
her
about
your
marriage
now
then
what
an
invention
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
show
that
you
wanted
your
own
capital
a
person
who
was
indifferent
would
not
have
been
attacked
with
the
species
of
fainting
fit
that
she
had
really
exclaimed
frederick
ha
my
fine
fellow
you
are
betraying
yourself
come
be
honest
a
feeling
of
nervous
weakness
stole
over
madame
arnoux
lover
why
no
i
assure
you
upon
my
word
of
honour
these
feeble
denials
ended
by
convincing
deslauriers
he
congratulated
his
friend
and
asked
him
for
some
details
frederick
gave
him
none
and
even
resisted
a
secret
yearning
to
concoct
a
few
as
for
the
mortgage
he
told
the
other
to
do
nothing
about
it
but
to
wait
deslauriers
thought
he
was
wrong
on
this
point
and
remonstrated
with
him
in
rather
a
churlish
fashion
he
was
besides
more
gloomy
malignant
and
irascible
than
ever
in
a
year
if
fortune
did
not
change
he
would
embark
for
america
or
blow
out
his
brains
indeed
he
appeared
to
be
in
such
a
rage
against
everything
and
so
uncompromising
in
his
radicalism
that
frederick
could
not
keep
from
saying
to
him
here
you
are
going
on
in
the
same
way
as
sénécal
deslauriers
at
this
remark
informed
him
that
that
individual
to
whom
he
alluded
had
been
discharged
from
the
magisterial
investigation
having
failed
to
supply
sufficient
evidence
no
doubt
to
justify
his
being
sent
for
trial
dussardier
was
so
much
overjoyed
at
the
release
of
sénécal
that
he
wanted
to
invite
his
friends
to
come
and
take
punch
with
him
and
begged
of
frederick
to
be
one
of
the
party
giving
the
latter
at
the
same
time
to
understand
that
he
would
be
found
in
the
company
of
hussonnet
who
had
proved
himself
a
very
good
friend
to
sénécal
in
fact
the
had
just
become
associated
with
a
business
establishment
whose
prospectus
contained
the
following
references
vineyard
agency
office
of
publicity
debt
recovery
and
intelligence
office
etc
but
the
bohemian
was
afraid
that
his
connection
with
trade
might
be
prejudicial
to
his
literary
reputation
and
he
had
accordingly
taken
the
mathematician
to
keep
the
accounts
although
the
situation
was
a
poor
one
sénécal
would
but
for
it
have
died
of
starvation
not
wishing
to
mortify
the
worthy
shopman
frederick
accepted
his
invitation
dussardier
three
days
beforehand
had
himself
waxed
the
red
floor
of
his
garret
beaten
the
armchair
and
knocked
off
the
dust
from
the
on
which
might
be
seen
under
a
globe
an
alabaster
timepiece
between
a
stalactite
and
a
cocoanut
as
his
two
chandeliers
and
his
chamber
candlestick
were
not
sufficient
he
had
borrowed
two
more
candlesticks
from
the
doorkeeper
and
these
five
lights
shone
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
which
was
covered
with
three
napkins
in
order
that
it
might
be
fit
to
have
placed
on
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
look
attractive
some
macaroons
biscuits
a
fancy
cake
and
a
dozen
bottles
of
beer
at
the
opposite
side
close
to
the
wall
which
was
hung
with
yellow
paper
there
was
a
little
mahogany
bookcase
containing
the
of
the
of
and
and
in
the
middle
of
the
alcove
the
face
of
béranger
was
smiling
in
a
rosewood
frame
the
guests
in
addition
to
deslauriers
and
sénécal
were
an
apothecary
who
had
just
been
admitted
but
who
had
not
enough
capital
to
start
in
business
for
himself
a
young
man
of
his
own
house
a
in
wines
an
architect
and
a
gentleman
employed
in
an
insurance
office
regimbart
had
not
been
able
to
come
regret
was
expressed
at
his
absence
they
welcomed
frederick
with
a
great
display
of
sympathy
as
they
all
knew
through
dussardier
what
he
had
said
at
dambreuse
house
sénécal
contented
himself
with
putting
out
his
hand
in
a
dignified
manner
he
remained
standing
near
the
the
others
seated
with
their
pipes
in
their
mouths
listened
to
him
while
he
held
forth
on
universal
suffrage
from
which
he
predicted
as
a
result
the
triumph
of
democracy
and
the
practical
application
of
the
principles
of
the
gospel
however
the
hour
was
at
hand
the
banquets
of
the
party
of
reform
were
becoming
more
numerous
in
the
provinces
piedmont
naples
tuscany
is
true
said
deslauriers
interrupting
him
abruptly
this
can
not
last
longer
and
he
began
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
situation
we
had
sacrificed
holland
to
obtain
from
england
the
recognition
of
louis
philippe
and
this
precious
english
alliance
was
lost
owing
to
the
spanish
marriages
in
switzerland
guizot
in
tow
with
the
austrian
maintained
the
treaties
of
prussia
with
her
zollverein
was
preparing
embarrassments
for
us
the
eastern
question
was
still
pending
the
fact
that
the
grand
duke
constantine
sends
presents
to
is
no
reason
for
placing
confidence
in
russia
as
for
home
affairs
never
have
so
many
blunders
such
stupidity
been
witnessed
the
government
no
longer
even
keeps
up
its
majority
everywhere
indeed
according
to
the
expression
it
is
naught
naught
naught
and
in
the
teeth
of
such
public
scandals
continued
the
advocate
with
his
arms
akimbo
they
declare
themselves
satisfied
the
allusion
to
a
notorious
vote
called
forth
applause
dussardier
uncorked
a
bottle
of
beer
the
froth
splashed
on
the
curtains
he
did
not
mind
it
he
filled
the
pipes
cut
the
cake
offered
each
of
them
a
slice
of
it
and
several
times
went
downstairs
to
see
whether
the
punch
was
coming
up
and
ere
long
they
lashed
themselves
up
into
a
state
of
excitement
as
they
all
felt
equally
exasperated
against
power
their
rage
was
of
a
violent
character
for
no
other
reason
save
that
they
hated
injustice
and
they
mixed
up
with
legitimate
grievances
the
most
idiotic
complaints
the
apothecary
groaned
over
the
pitiable
condition
of
our
fleet
the
insurance
agent
could
not
tolerate
marshal
soult
two
sentinels
deslauriers
denounced
the
jesuits
who
had
just
installed
themselves
publicly
at
lille
sénécal
execrated
cousin
much
more
for
eclecticism
by
teaching
that
certitude
can
be
deduced
from
reason
developed
selfishness
and
destroyed
solidarity
the
traveller
in
wines
knowing
very
little
about
these
matters
remarked
in
a
very
loud
tone
that
he
had
forgotten
many
infamies
the
royal
carriage
on
the
northern
line
must
have
cost
eighty
thousand
francs
who
pay
the
amount
aye
who
pay
the
amount
repeated
the
clerk
as
angrily
as
if
this
amount
had
been
drawn
out
of
his
own
pocket
then
followed
recriminations
against
the
lynxes
of
the
bourse
and
the
corruption
of
officials
according
to
sénécal
they
ought
to
go
higher
up
and
lay
the
blame
first
of
all
on
the
princes
who
had
revived
the
morals
of
the
regency
period
have
you
not
lately
seen
the
duc
de
montpensier
friends
coming
back
from
vincennes
no
doubt
in
a
state
of
intoxication
and
disturbing
with
their
songs
the
workmen
of
the
faubourg
there
was
even
a
cry
of
with
the
thieves
said
the
apothecary
i
was
there
and
i
joined
in
the
cry
so
much
the
better
the
people
are
at
last
waking
up
since
the
case
d
for
my
part
that
case
caused
me
some
pain
said
dussardier
because
it
imputed
dishonour
to
an
old
soldier
do
you
know
sénécal
went
on
what
they
have
discovered
at
the
duchesse
de
praslin
house
but
here
the
door
was
sent
flying
open
with
a
kick
hussonnet
entered
d
this
refers
to
a
charge
of
corruption
made
in
against
a
general
who
was
a
member
of
the
translator
hail
messeigneurs
said
he
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
bed
no
allusion
was
made
to
his
article
which
he
was
sorry
however
for
having
written
as
the
maréchale
had
sharply
reprimanded
him
on
account
of
it
he
had
just
seen
at
the
théâtre
de
dumas
the
de
and
declared
that
it
seemed
to
him
a
stupid
play
such
a
criticism
surprised
the
democrats
as
this
drama
by
its
tendency
or
rather
by
its
scenery
flattered
their
passions
they
protested
sénécal
in
order
to
bring
this
discussion
to
a
close
asked
whether
the
play
served
the
cause
of
democracy
yes
perhaps
but
it
is
written
in
a
style
well
then
is
a
good
play
what
is
style
is
the
idea
and
without
allowing
frederick
to
say
a
word
now
i
was
pointing
out
that
in
the
praslin
case
hussonnet
interrupted
him
ha
here
another
trick
i
disgusted
at
it
and
others
as
well
as
you
returned
deslauriers
it
has
only
got
five
papers
taken
listen
while
i
read
this
paragraph
and
drawing
his
out
of
his
pocket
he
read
have
since
the
establishment
of
the
best
of
republics
been
subjected
to
twelve
hundred
and
press
prosecutions
from
which
the
results
to
the
writers
have
been
imprisonment
extending
over
a
period
of
three
thousand
one
hundred
and
years
and
the
light
sum
of
seven
million
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
five
hundred
francs
by
way
of
fine
that
charming
eh
they
all
sneered
bitterly
frederick
incensed
against
the
others
broke
in
democratie
has
had
proceedings
taken
against
it
on
account
of
its
feuilleton
a
novel
entitled
woman
come
that
good
said
hussonnet
suppose
they
prevented
us
from
having
our
share
of
the
women
but
what
is
it
that
not
prohibited
exclaimed
deslauriers
to

luxembourg

the
hymn
to

and
the
typographers
banquet
has
been
interdicted
a
voice
cried
with
a
thick
articulation
it
was
that
of
an
architect
who
had
sat
concealed
in
the
shade
of
the
alcove
and
who
had
remained
silent
up
to
that
moment
he
added
that
the
week
before
a
man
named
rouget
had
been
convicted
of
offering
insults
to
the
king
that
gurnet
e
is
fried
said
hussonnet
this
joke
appeared
so
improper
to
sénécal
that
he
reproached
hussonnet
for
defending
the
juggler
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
the
friend
of
the
traitor
dumouriez
i
quite
the
contrary
he
considered
louis
philippe
commonplace
one
of
the
national
guard
types
of
men
all
that
savoured
most
of
the
and
the
cotton
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
heart
the
bohemian
gave
utterance
to
the
rhetorical
phrases
it
is
always
with
a
new
pleasure
polish
nationality
will
not
perish
our
great
works
will
be
pursued
give
me
some
money
for
my
little
family
e
means
a
translator
they
all
laughed
hugely
declaring
that
he
was
a
delightful
fellow
full
of
wit
their
delight
was
redoubled
at
the
sight
of
the
bowl
of
punch
which
was
brought
in
by
the
keeper
of
a
café
the
flames
of
the
alcohol
and
those
of
the
soon
heated
the
apartment
and
the
light
from
the
garret
passing
across
the
courtyard
illuminated
the
side
of
an
opposite
roof
with
the
flue
of
a
chimney
whose
black
outlines
could
be
traced
through
the
darkness
of
night
they
talked
in
very
loud
tones
all
at
the
same
time
they
had
taken
off
their
coats
they
gave
blows
to
the
furniture
they
touched
glasses
hussonnet
exclaimed
send
up
some
great
ladies
in
order
that
this
may
be
more
tour
de
nesles
have
more
local
colouring
and
be
more
rembrandtesque
gadzooks
and
the
apothecary
who
kept
stirring
about
the
punch
indefinitely
began
to
sing
with
expanded
chest
i
two
big
oxen
in
my
stable
two
big
white
oxen
sénécal
laid
his
hand
on
the
apothecary
mouth
he
did
not
like
disorderly
conduct
and
the
lodgers
pressed
their
faces
against
the
surprised
at
the
unwonted
uproar
that
was
taking
place
in
dussardier
room
the
honest
fellow
was
happy
and
said
that
this
recalled
to
his
mind
their
little
parties
on
the
quai
napoléon
in
days
gone
by
however
they
missed
many
who
used
to
be
present
at
these
reunions
pellerin
for
instance
we
can
do
without
him
observed
frederick
and
deslauriers
enquired
about
martinon
what
has
become
of
that
interesting
gentleman
frederick
immediately
giving
vent
to
the
which
he
bore
to
martinon
attacked
his
mental
capacity
his
character
his
false
elegance
his
entire
personality
he
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
an
upstart
peasant
the
new
aristocracy
the
mercantile
class
was
not
as
good
as
the
old
the
nobility
he
maintained
this
and
the
democrats
expressed
their
approval
as
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
one
class
and
they
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
other
they
were
charmed
with
him
the
apothecary
compared
him
to
shée
who
though
a
peer
of
france
defended
the
cause
of
the
people
the
time
had
come
for
taking
their
departure
they
all
separated
with
great
handshakings
dussardier
in
a
spirit
of
affectionate
solicitude
saw
frederick
and
deslauriers
home
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
street
the
advocate
assumed
a
thoughtful
air
and
after
a
moment
silence
you
have
a
great
grudge
then
against
pellerin
frederick
did
not
hide
his
rancour
the
painter
in
the
meantime
had
withdrawn
the
notorious
picture
from
the
a
person
should
not
let
himself
be
put
out
by
trifles
what
was
the
good
of
making
an
enemy
for
himself
he
has
given
way
to
a
burst
of
excusable
in
a
man
who
has
a
sou
you
of
course
ca
understand
that
and
when
deslauriers
had
gone
up
to
his
own
apartments
the
shopman
did
not
part
with
frederick
he
even
urged
his
friend
to
buy
the
portrait
in
fact
pellerin
abandoning
the
hope
of
being
able
to
intimidate
him
had
got
round
them
so
that
they
might
use
their
influence
to
obtain
the
thing
for
him
deslauriers
spoke
about
it
again
and
pressed
him
on
the
point
urging
that
the
artist
claims
were
reasonable
i
am
sure
that
for
a
sum
of
perhaps
five
hundred
francs
oh
give
it
to
him
wait
here
it
is
said
frederick
the
picture
was
brought
the
same
evening
it
appeared
to
him
a
still
more
atrocious
daub
than
when
he
had
seen
it
first
the
and
the
shades
were
darkened
under
the
excessive
retouchings
and
they
seemed
obscured
when
brought
into
relation
with
the
lights
which
having
remained
very
brilliant
here
and
there
destroyed
the
harmony
of
the
entire
picture
frederick
revenged
himself
for
having
had
to
pay
for
it
by
bitterly
disparaging
it
deslauriers
believed
in
frederick
statement
on
the
point
and
expressed
approval
of
his
conduct
for
he
had
always
been
ambitious
of
constituting
a
phalanx
of
which
he
would
be
the
leader
certain
men
take
delight
in
making
their
friends
do
things
which
are
disagreeable
to
them
meanwhile
frederick
did
not
renew
his
visits
to
the
dambreuses
he
lacked
the
capital
for
the
investment
he
would
have
to
enter
into
endless
explanations
on
the
subject
he
hesitated
about
making
up
his
mind
perhaps
he
was
in
the
right
nothing
was
certain
now
the
speculation
any
more
than
other
things
he
would
have
to
give
up
society
of
that
sort
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
deslauriers
was
dissuaded
from
having
anything
further
to
do
with
the
undertaking
from
sheer
force
of
hatred
he
had
grown
virtuous
and
again
he
preferred
frederick
in
a
position
of
mediocrity
in
this
way
he
remained
his
friend
equal
and
in
more
intimate
relationship
with
him
mademoiselle
roque
commission
had
been
very
badly
executed
her
father
wrote
to
him
supplying
him
with
the
most
precise
directions
and
concluded
his
letter
with
this
piece
of
foolery
at
the
risk
of
giving
you
on
the
frederick
could
not
do
otherwise
than
call
upon
the
arnouxs
once
more
he
went
to
the
warehouse
where
he
could
see
nobody
the
firm
being
in
a
tottering
condition
the
clerks
imitated
the
carelessness
of
their
master
he
brushed
against
the
shelves
laden
with
earthenware
which
filled
up
the
entire
space
in
the
centre
of
the
establishment
then
when
he
reached
the
lower
end
facing
the
counter
he
walked
with
a
more
noisy
tread
in
order
to
make
himself
heard
the
portières
parted
and
madame
arnoux
appeared
what
you
here
you
yes
she
faltered
with
some
agitation
i
was
looking
for
he
saw
her
handkerchief
near
the
desk
and
guessed
that
she
had
come
down
to
her
husband
warehouse
to
have
an
account
given
to
her
as
to
the
business
to
clear
up
some
matter
that
caused
her
anxiety
but
perhaps
there
is
something
you
want
said
she
a
mere
nothing
madame
these
are
intolerable
they
are
always
out
of
the
way
they
ought
not
to
be
blamed
on
the
contrary
he
congratulated
himself
on
the
circumstance
she
gazed
at
him
in
an
ironical
fashion
well
and
this
marriage
what
marriage
your
own
mine
i
never
marry
as
long
as
i
live
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
contradict
his
words
though
indeed
such
things
must
be
after
all
we
take
refuge
in
the
commonplace
despairing
of
ever
realising
the
beautiful
existence
of
which
we
have
dreamed
all
your
dreams
however
are
not
so
candid
what
do
you
mean
when
you
drive
to
races
with
women
he
cursed
the
maréchale
then
something
recurred
to
his
memory
but
it
was
you
begged
of
me
yourself
to
see
her
at
one
time
in
the
interest
of
arnoux
she
replied
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
you
take
advantage
of
it
to
amuse
yourself
good
god
let
us
forget
all
these
foolish
things
is
right
since
you
are
going
to
be
married
and
she
stifled
a
sigh
while
she
bit
her
lips
then
he
exclaimed
but
i
tell
you
again
i
am
not
can
you
believe
that
i
with
my
intellectual
requirements
my
habits
am
going
to
bury
myself
in
the
provinces
in
order
to
play
cards
look
after
masons
and
walk
about
in
wooden
shoes
what
object
pray
could
i
have
for
taking
such
a
step
you
been
told
that
she
was
rich
have
you
ah
what
do
i
care
about
money
could
i
after
yearning
long
for
that
which
is
most
lovely
tender
enchanting
a
sort
of
paradise
under
a
human
form
and
having
found
this
sweet
ideal
at
last
when
this
vision
hides
every
other
from
my
view
and
taking
her
head
between
his
two
hands
he
began
to
kiss
her
on
the
eyelids
repeating
no
no
no
never
will
i
marry
never
never
she
submitted
to
these
caresses
her
mingled
amazement
and
delight
having
bereft
her
of
the
power
of
motion
the
door
of
the
storeroom
above
the
staircase
fell
back
and
she
remained
with
outstretched
arms
as
if
to
bid
him
keep
silence
steps
drew
near
then
some
one
said
from
behind
the
door
is
madame
there
come
in
madame
arnoux
had
her
elbow
on
the
counter
and
was
twisting
about
a
pen
between
her
fingers
quietly
when
the
threw
aside
the
portière
frederick
started
up
as
if
on
the
point
of
leaving
madame
i
have
the
honour
to
salute
you
the
set
will
be
ready
will
it
not
i
may
count
on
this
she
made
no
reply
but
by
thus
silently
becoming
his
accomplice
in
the
deception
she
made
his
face
flush
with
the
crimson
glow
of
adultery
on
the
following
day
he
paid
her
another
visit
she
received
him
and
in
order
to
follow
up
the
advantage
he
had
gained
frederick
immediately
without
any
preamble
attempted
to
offer
some
justification
for
the
accidental
meeting
in
the
champ
de
mars
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
led
to
his
being
in
that
woman
company
while
admitting
that
she
was
pretty
which
really
was
not
the
case
how
could
she
for
even
a
moment
absorb
his
thoughts
seeing
that
he
loved
another
woman
you
know
it
well
i
told
you
it
was
so
madame
arnoux
hung
down
her
head
i
am
sorry
you
said
such
a
thing
why
the
most
ordinary
proprieties
now
demand
that
i
should
see
you
no
more
he
protested
that
his
love
was
of
an
innocent
character
the
past
ought
to
be
a
guaranty
as
to
his
future
conduct
he
had
of
his
own
accord
made
it
a
point
of
honour
with
himself
not
to
disturb
her
existence
not
to
deafen
her
with
his
complaints
but
yesterday
my
heart
overflowed
we
ought
not
to
let
our
thoughts
dwell
on
that
moment
my
friend
and
yet
where
would
be
the
harm
in
two
wretched
beings
mingling
their
griefs
for
indeed
you
are
not
happy
any
more
than
i
am
oh
i
know
you
you
have
no
one
who
responds
to
your
craving
for
affection
for
devotion
i
will
do
anything
you
wish
i
will
not
offend
you
i
swear
to
you
that
i
will
not
and
he
let
himself
fall
on
his
knees
in
spite
of
himself
giving
way
beneath
the
weight
of
the
feelings
that
oppressed
his
heart
rise
she
said
i
desire
you
to
do
so
and
she
declared
in
an
imperious
tone
that
if
he
did
not
comply
with
her
wish
she
would
never
see
him
again
ha
i
defy
you
to
do
it
returned
frederick
what
is
there
for
me
to
do
in
the
world
other
men
strive
for
riches
celebrity
power
but
i
have
no
profession
you
are
my
exclusive
occupation
my
whole
wealth
the
object
the
centre
of
my
existence
and
of
my
thoughts
i
can
no
more
live
without
you
than
without
the
air
of
heaven
do
you
not
feel
the
aspiration
of
my
soul
ascending
towards
yours
and
that
they
must
intermingle
and
that
i
am
dying
on
your
account
madame
arnoux
began
to
tremble
in
every
limb
oh
leave
me
i
beg
of
you
the
look
of
utter
confusion
in
her
face
made
him
pause
then
he
advanced
a
step
but
she
drew
back
with
her
two
hands
clasped
leave
me
in
the
name
of
heaven
for
mercy
sake
and
frederick
loved
her
so
much
that
he
went
away
soon
afterwards
he
was
filled
with
rage
against
himself
declared
in
his
own
mind
that
he
was
an
idiot
and
after
the
lapse
of
hours
returned
madame
was
not
there
he
remained
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
stupefied
with
anger
and
indignation
arnoux
appeared
and
informed
frederick
that
his
wife
had
that
very
morning
gone
out
to
take
up
her
residence
at
a
little
of
which
he
had
become
tenant
at
auteuil
as
he
had
given
up
possession
of
the
house
at
this
is
another
of
her
whims
no
matter
as
she
is
settled
at
last
and
myself
too
for
that
matter
so
much
the
better
let
us
dine
together
this
evening
will
you
frederick
pleaded
as
an
excuse
some
urgent
business
then
he
hurried
away
of
his
own
accord
to
auteuil
madame
arnoux
allowed
an
exclamation
of
joy
to
escape
her
lips
then
all
his
bitterness
vanished
he
did
not
say
one
word
about
his
love
in
order
to
inspire
her
with
confidence
in
him
he
even
exaggerated
his
reserve
and
on
his
asking
whether
he
might
call
again
she
replied
why
of
course
putting
out
her
hand
which
she
withdrew
the
next
moment
from
that
time
forth
frederick
increased
his
visits
he
promised
extra
fares
to
the
cabman
who
drove
him
but
often
he
grew
impatient
at
the
slow
pace
of
the
horse
and
alighting
on
the
ground
he
would
make
a
dash
after
an
omnibus
and
climb
to
the
top
of
it
out
of
breath
then
with
what
disdain
he
surveyed
the
faces
of
those
around
him
who
were
not
going
to
see
her
he
could
distinguish
her
house
at
a
distance
with
an
enormous
honeysuckle
covering
on
one
side
the
planks
of
the
roof
it
was
a
kind
of
swiss
châlet
painted
red
with
a
balcony
outside
in
the
garden
there
were
three
old
and
on
a
rising
ground
in
the
centre
might
be
seen
a
parasol
made
of
thatch
held
up
by
the
trunk
of
a
tree
under
the
slatework
lining
the
walls
a
big
badly
fastened
hung
from
one
place
to
another
after
the
fashion
of
a
rotten
cable
the
which
it
was
rather
hard
to
pull
was
slow
in
ringing
and
a
long
time
always
elapsed
before
it
was
answered
on
each
occasion
he
experienced
a
pang
of
suspense
a
fear
born
of
irresolution
then
his
ears
would
be
greeted
with
the
pattering
of
the
slippers
over
the
gravel
or
else
madame
arnoux
herself
would
make
her
appearance
one
day
he
came
up
behind
her
just
as
she
was
stooping
down
in
the
act
of
gathering
violets
her
daughter
capricious
disposition
had
made
it
necessary
to
send
the
girl
to
a
convent
her
little
son
was
at
school
every
afternoon
arnoux
was
now
in
the
habit
of
taking
prolonged
luncheons
at
the
with
regimbart
and
their
friend
compain
they
gave
themselves
no
bother
about
anything
that
occurred
no
matter
how
disagreeable
it
might
be
it
was
clearly
understood
between
frederick
and
her
that
they
should
not
belong
to
each
other
by
this
convention
they
were
preserved
from
danger
and
they
found
it
easier
to
pour
out
their
hearts
to
each
other
she
told
him
all
about
her
early
life
at
chartres
which
she
spent
with
her
mother
her
devotion
when
she
had
reached
her
twelfth
year
then
her
passion
for
music
when
she
used
to
sing
till
nightfall
in
her
little
room
from
which
the
ramparts
could
be
seen
he
related
to
her
how
melancholy
broodings
had
haunted
him
at
college
and
how
a
woman
face
shone
brightly
in
the
cloudland
of
his
imagination
so
that
when
he
first
laid
eyes
upon
her
he
felt
that
her
features
were
quite
familiar
to
him
these
conversations
as
a
rule
covered
only
the
years
during
which
they
had
been
acquainted
with
each
other
he
recalled
to
her
recollection
insignificant
details
the
colour
of
her
dress
at
a
certain
period
a
woman
whom
they
had
met
on
a
certain
day
what
she
had
said
on
another
occasion
and
she
replied
quite
astonished
yes
i
remember
their
tastes
their
judgments
were
the
same
often
one
of
them
when
listening
to
the
other
exclaimed
that
the
way
with
me
and
the
other
replied
and
with
me
too
then
there
were
endless
complaints
about
providence
why
was
it
not
the
will
of
heaven
if
we
had
only
met
ah
if
i
had
been
younger
she
sighed
no
but
if
i
had
been
a
little
older
and
they
pictured
to
themselves
a
life
entirely
given
up
to
love
sufficiently
rich
to
fill
up
the
vastest
solitudes
surpassing
all
other
joys
defying
all
forms
of
wretchedness
in
which
the
hours
would
glide
away
in
a
continual
outpouring
of
their
own
emotions
and
which
would
be
as
bright
and
glorious
as
the
palpitating
splendour
of
the
stars
they
were
nearly
always
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
exposed
to
the
free
air
of
heaven
the
tops
of
trees
yellowed
by
the
autumn
raised
their
crests
in
front
of
them
at
unequal
heights
up
to
the
edge
of
the
pale
sky
or
else
they
walked
on
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
into
a
whose
only
furniture
was
a
couch
of
grey
canvas
black
specks
stained
the
glass
the
walls
exhaled
a
mouldy
smell
and
they
remained
there
chatting
freely
about
all
sorts
of
topics
anything
that
happened
to
arise
in
a
spirit
of
hilarity
sometimes
the
rays
of
the
sun
passing
through
the
venetian
blind
extended
from
the
ceiling
down
to
the
flagstones
like
the
strings
of
a
lyre
particles
of
dust
whirled
amid
these
luminous
bars
she
amused
herself
by
dividing
them
with
her
hand
frederick
gently
caught
hold
of
her
and
he
gazed
on
the
twinings
of
her
veins
the
grain
of
her
skin
and
the
form
of
her
fingers
each
of
those
fingers
of
hers
was
for
him
more
than
a
thing
almost
a
person
she
gave
him
her
gloves
and
the
week
after
her
handkerchief
she
called
him
frederick
he
called
her
marie
adoring
this
name
which
as
he
said
was
expressly
made
to
be
uttered
with
a
sigh
of
ecstasy
and
which
seemed
to
contain
clouds
of
incense
and
scattered
heaps
of
roses
they
soon
came
to
an
understanding
as
to
the
days
on
which
he
would
call
to
see
her
and
leaving
the
house
as
if
by
mere
chance
she
walked
along
the
road
to
meet
him
she
made
no
effort
whatever
to
excite
his
love
lost
in
that
listlessness
which
is
characteristic
of
intense
happiness
during
the
whole
season
she
wore
a
brown
silk
with
velvet
borders
of
the
same
colour
a
large
garment
which
united
the
indolence
of
her
attitudes
and
her
grave
physiognomy
besides
she
had
just
reached
the
autumnal
period
of
womanhood
in
which
reflection
is
combined
with
tenderness
in
which
the
beginning
of
maturity
colours
the
face
with
a
more
intense
flame
when
strength
of
feeling
mingles
with
experience
of
life
and
when
having
completely
expanded
the
entire
being
overflows
with
a
richness
in
harmony
with
its
beauty
never
had
she
possessed
more
sweetness
more
leniency
secure
in
the
thought
that
she
would
not
err
she
abandoned
herself
to
a
sentiment
which
seemed
to
her
won
by
her
sorrows
and
moreover
it
was
so
innocent
and
fresh
what
an
abyss
lay
between
the
coarseness
of
arnoux
and
the
adoration
of
frederick
he
trembled
at
the
thought
that
by
an
imprudent
word
he
might
lose
all
that
he
had
gained
saying
to
himself
that
an
opportunity
might
be
found
again
but
that
a
foolish
step
could
never
be
repaired
he
wished
that
she
should
give
herself
rather
than
that
he
should
take
her
the
assurance
of
being
loved
by
her
delighted
him
like
a
foretaste
of
possession
and
then
the
charm
of
her
person
troubled
his
heart
more
than
his
senses
it
was
an
indefinable
feeling
of
bliss
a
sort
of
intoxication
that
made
him
lose
sight
of
the
possibility
of
having
his
happiness
completed
apart
from
her
he
was
consumed
with
longing
ere
long
the
conversations
were
interrupted
by
long
spells
of
silence
sometimes
a
species
of
sexual
shame
made
them
blush
in
each
presence
all
the
precautions
they
took
to
hide
their
love
only
unveiled
it
the
stronger
it
grew
the
more
constrained
they
became
in
manner
the
effect
of
this
dissimulation
was
to
intensify
their
sensibility
they
experienced
a
sensation
of
delight
at
the
odour
of
moist
leaves
they
could
not
endure
the
east
wind
they
got
irritated
without
any
apparent
cause
and
had
melancholy
forebodings
the
sound
of
a
footstep
the
creaking
of
the
wainscoting
filled
them
with
as
much
terror
as
if
they
had
been
guilty
they
felt
as
if
they
were
being
pushed
towards
the
edge
of
a
chasm
they
were
surrounded
by
a
tempestuous
atmosphere
and
when
complaints
escaped
frederick
lips
she
made
accusations
against
herself
yes
i
am
doing
wrong
i
am
acting
as
if
i
were
a
coquette
do
come
any
more
then
he
would
repeat
the
same
oaths
to
which
on
each
occasion
she
listened
with
renewed
pleasure
his
return
to
paris
and
the
fuss
occasioned
by
new
year
day
interrupted
their
meetings
to
some
extent
when
he
returned
he
had
an
air
of
greater
every
moment
she
went
out
to
give
orders
and
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
she
received
every
visitor
that
called
during
the
evening
after
this
they
engaged
in
conversations
about
léotade
guizot
the
pope
the
insurrection
at
palermo
and
the
banquet
of
the
twelfth
arrondissement
which
had
caused
some
disquietude
frederick
eased
his
mind
by
railing
against
power
for
he
longed
like
deslauriers
to
turn
the
whole
world
upside
down
so
soured
had
he
now
become
madame
arnoux
on
her
side
had
become
sad
her
husband
indulging
in
displays
of
wild
folly
was
flirting
with
one
of
the
girls
in
his
pottery
works
the
one
who
was
known
as
the
girl
from
bordeaux
madame
arnoux
was
herself
informed
about
it
by
frederick
he
wanted
to
make
use
of
it
as
an
argument
inasmuch
as
she
was
the
victim
of
deception
oh
i
not
much
concerned
about
it
she
said
this
admission
on
her
part
seemed
to
him
to
strengthen
the
intimacy
between
them
would
arnoux
be
seized
with
mistrust
with
regard
to
them
no
not
now
she
told
him
that
one
evening
he
had
left
them
talking
together
and
had
afterwards
come
back
again
and
listened
behind
the
door
and
as
they
both
were
chatting
at
the
time
of
matters
that
were
of
no
consequence
he
had
lived
since
then
in
a
state
of
complete
security
with
good
reason
too
is
that
not
so
said
frederick
bitterly
yes
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
not
to
have
given
so
risky
an
answer
one
day
she
was
not
at
home
at
the
hour
when
he
usually
called
to
him
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
treason
in
this
he
was
next
displeased
at
seeing
the
flowers
which
he
used
to
bring
her
always
placed
in
a
glass
of
water
where
then
would
you
like
me
to
put
them
oh
not
there
however
they
are
not
so
cold
there
as
they
would
be
near
your
heart
not
long
afterwards
he
reproached
her
for
having
been
at
the
italian
opera
the
night
before
without
having
given
him
a
previous
intimation
of
her
intention
to
go
there
others
had
seen
admired
fallen
in
love
with
her
perhaps
frederick
was
fastening
on
those
suspicions
of
his
merely
in
order
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
her
to
torment
her
for
he
was
beginning
to
hate
her
and
the
very
least
he
might
expect
was
that
she
should
share
in
his
sufferings
one
afternoon
towards
the
middle
of
february
he
surprised
her
in
a
state
of
great
mental
excitement
eugène
had
been
complaining
about
his
sore
throat
the
doctor
had
told
her
however
that
it
was
a
trifling
ailment
a
bad
cold
an
attack
of
influenza
frederick
was
astonished
at
the
child
stupefied
look
nevertheless
he
reassured
the
mother
and
brought
forward
the
cases
of
several
children
of
the
same
age
who
had
been
attacked
with
similar
ailments
and
had
been
speedily
cured
really
why
yes
assuredly
oh
how
good
you
are
and
she
caught
his
hand
he
clasped
hers
tightly
in
his
oh
let
it
go
what
does
it
signify
when
it
is
to
one
who
sympathises
with
you
that
you
offer
it
you
place
every
confidence
in
me
when
i
speak
of
these
things
but
you
distrust
me
when
i
talk
to
you
about
my
love
i
do
doubt
you
on
that
point
my
poor
friend
why
this
distrust
as
if
i
were
a
wretch
capable
of
abusing
oh
no
if
i
had
only
a
proof
what
proof
the
proof
that
a
person
might
give
to
the
first
comer
what
you
have
granted
to
myself
and
he
recalled
to
her
recollection
how
on
one
occasion
they
had
gone
out
together
on
a
winter
twilight
when
there
was
a
fog
this
seemed
now
a
long
time
ago
what
then
was
to
prevent
her
from
showing
herself
on
his
arm
before
the
whole
world
without
any
fear
on
her
part
and
without
any
mental
reservation
on
his
not
having
anyone
around
them
who
could
importune
them
be
it
so
she
said
with
a
promptness
of
decision
that
at
first
astonished
frederick
but
he
replied
in
a
lively
fashion
would
you
like
me
to
wait
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
tronchet
and
the
rue
de
la
ferme
good
heavens
my
friend
faltered
madame
arnoux
without
giving
her
time
to
reflect
he
added
next
tuesday
i
suppose
tuesday
yes
between
two
and
three
i
will
be
there
and
she
turned
aside
her
face
with
a
movement
of
shame
frederick
placed
his
lips
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
oh
this
is
not
right
she
said
you
will
make
me
repent
he
turned
away
dreading
the
fickleness
which
is
customary
with
women
then
on
the
threshold
he
murmured
softly
as
if
it
were
a
thing
that
was
thoroughly
understood
on
tuesday
she
lowered
her
beautiful
eyes
in
a
cautious
and
resigned
fashion
frederick
had
a
plan
arranged
in
his
mind
he
hoped
that
owing
to
the
rain
or
the
sun
he
might
get
her
to
stop
under
some
doorway
and
that
once
there
she
would
go
into
some
house
the
difficulty
was
to
find
one
that
would
suit
he
made
a
search
and
about
the
middle
of
the
rue
tronchet
he
read
at
a
distance
on
a
signboard
furnished
apartments
the
waiter
divining
his
object
showed
him
immediately
above
the
a
room
and
a
closet
with
two
exits
frederick
took
it
for
a
month
and
paid
in
advance
then
he
went
into
three
shops
to
buy
the
rarest
perfumery
he
got
a
piece
of
imitation
guipure
which
was
to
replace
the
horrible
red
cotton
he
selected
a
pair
of
blue
satin
slippers
only
the
fear
of
appearing
coarse
checked
the
amount
of
his
purchases
he
came
back
with
them
and
with
more
devotion
than
those
who
are
erecting
processional
altars
he
altered
the
position
of
the
furniture
arranged
the
curtains
himself
put
heather
in
the
fireplace
and
covered
the
chest
of
drawers
with
violets
he
would
have
liked
to
pave
the
entire
apartment
with
gold
is
the
time
said
he
to
himself
yes
i
am
not
dreaming
and
he
felt
his
heart
throbbing
violently
under
the
delirious
excitement
begotten
by
his
anticipations
then
when
everything
was
ready
he
carried
off
the
key
in
his
pocket
as
if
the
happiness
which
slept
there
might
have
flown
away
along
with
it
a
letter
from
his
mother
was
awaiting
him
when
he
reached
his
abode
why
such
a
long
absence
your
conduct
is
beginning
to
look
ridiculous
i
understand
your
hesitating
more
or
less
at
first
with
regard
to
this
union
however
think
well
upon
it
and
she
put
the
matter
before
him
with
the
utmost
clearness
an
income
of
thousand
francs
however
people
were
talking
about
it
and
roque
was
waiting
for
a
definite
answer
as
for
the
young
girl
her
position
was
truly
most
embarrassing
she
is
deeply
attached
to
you
frederick
threw
aside
the
letter
even
before
he
had
finished
reading
it
and
opened
another
epistle
which
came
from
deslauriers
dear
old
boy
the
is
ripe
in
accordance
with
your
promise
we
may
count
on
you
we
meet
at
daybreak
in
the
place
du
panthéon
drop
into
the
café
soufflot
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
have
a
chat
with
you
before
the
manifestation
takes
place
oh
i
know
them
with
their
manifestations
a
thousand
thanks
i
have
a
more
agreeable
appointment
and
on
the
following
morning
at
eleven
frederick
had
left
the
house
he
wanted
to
give
one
last
glance
at
the
preparations
then
who
could
tell
but
that
by
some
chance
or
other
she
might
be
at
the
place
of
meeting
before
him
as
he
emerged
from
the
rue
tronchet
he
heard
a
great
clamour
behind
the
madeleine
he
pressed
forward
and
saw
at
the
far
end
of
the
square
to
the
left
a
number
of
men
in
blouses
and
people
in
fact
a
manifesto
published
in
the
newspapers
had
summoned
to
this
spot
all
who
had
subscribed
to
the
banquet
of
the
reform
party
the
ministry
had
almost
without
a
moment
delay
posted
up
a
proclamation
prohibiting
the
meeting
the
parliamentary
opposition
had
on
the
previous
evening
disclaimed
any
connection
with
it
but
the
patriots
who
were
unaware
of
this
resolution
on
the
part
of
their
leaders
had
come
to
the
followed
by
a
great
crowd
of
spectators
a
deputation
from
the
schools
had
made
its
way
a
short
time
before
to
the
house
of
odillon
barrot
it
was
now
at
the
residence
of
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
and
nobody
could
tell
whether
the
banquet
would
take
place
whether
the
government
would
carry
out
its
threat
and
whether
the
national
guards
would
make
their
appearance
people
were
as
much
enraged
against
the
deputies
as
against
power
the
crowd
was
growing
bigger
and
bigger
when
suddenly
the
strains
of
the
marseillaise
rang
through
the
air
it
was
the
students
column
which
had
just
arrived
on
the
scene
they
marched
along
at
an
ordinary
walking
pace
in
double
file
and
in
good
order
with
angry
faces
bare
hands
and
all
exclaiming
at
intervals
long
live
reform
down
with
guizot
frederick
friends
were
there
sure
enough
they
would
have
noticed
him
and
dragged
him
along
with
them
he
quickly
sought
refuge
in
the
rue
de
when
the
students
had
taken
two
turns
round
the
madeleine
they
went
down
in
the
direction
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
it
was
full
of
people
and
at
a
distance
the
crowd
pressed
close
together
had
the
appearance
of
a
field
of
dark
ears
of
corn
swaying
to
and
fro
at
the
same
moment
some
soldiers
of
the
line
ranged
themselves
in
at
the
side
of
the
church
the
groups
remained
standing
there
however
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
this
some
in
civilian
dress
seized
the
most
riotous
of
them
in
a
brutal
fashion
and
carried
them
off
to
the
frederick
in
spite
of
his
indignation
remained
silent
he
might
have
been
arrested
along
with
the
others
and
he
would
have
missed
madame
arnoux
a
little
while
afterwards
the
helmets
of
the
municipal
guards
appeared
they
kept
striking
about
them
with
the
flat
side
of
their
sabres
a
horse
fell
down
the
people
made
a
rush
forward
to
save
him
and
as
soon
as
the
rider
was
in
the
saddle
they
all
ran
away
then
there
was
a
great
silence
the
thin
rain
which
had
moistened
the
asphalt
was
no
longer
falling
clouds
floated
past
gently
swept
on
by
the
west
wind
frederick
began
running
through
the
rue
tronchet
looking
before
him
and
behind
him
at
length
it
struck
two
ha
now
is
the
time
said
he
to
himself
she
is
leaving
her
house
she
is
approaching
and
a
minute
after
she
would
have
had
time
to
be
here
up
to
three
he
tried
to
keep
quiet
no
she
is
not
going
to
be
late
a
little
patience
and
for
want
of
something
to
do
he
examined
the
most
interesting
shops
that
he
passed
a
bookseller
a
saddler
and
a
mourning
warehouse
soon
he
knew
the
names
of
the
different
books
the
various
kinds
of
harness
and
every
sort
of
material
the
persons
who
looked
after
these
establishments
from
seeing
him
continually
going
backwards
and
forwards
were
at
first
surprised
and
then
alarmed
and
they
closed
up
their
no
doubt
she
had
met
with
some
impediment
and
for
that
reason
she
must
be
enduring
pain
on
account
of
it
but
what
delight
would
be
afforded
in
a
very
short
time
for
she
would
come
that
was
certain
she
has
given
me
her
promise
in
the
meantime
an
intolerable
feeling
of
anxiety
was
gradually
seizing
hold
of
him
impelled
by
an
absurd
idea
he
returned
to
his
hotel
as
if
he
expected
to
find
her
there
at
the
same
moment
she
might
have
reached
the
street
in
which
their
meeting
was
to
take
place
he
rushed
out
was
there
no
one
and
he
resumed
his
tramp
up
and
down
the
footpath
he
stared
at
the
gaps
in
the
pavement
the
mouths
of
the
gutters
the
candelabra
and
the
numbers
above
the
doors
the
most
trifling
objects
became
for
him
companions
or
rather
ironical
spectators
and
the
regular
fronts
of
the
houses
seemed
to
him
to
have
a
pitiless
aspect
he
was
suffering
from
cold
feet
he
felt
as
if
he
were
about
to
succumb
to
the
dejection
which
was
crushing
him
the
reverberation
of
his
footsteps
vibrated
through
his
brain
when
he
saw
by
his
watch
that
it
was
four
he
experienced
as
it
were
a
sense
of
vertigo
a
feeling
of
dismay
he
tried
to
repeat
some
verses
to
himself
to
enter
on
a
calculation
no
matter
of
what
sort
to
invent
some
kind
of
story
impossible
he
was
beset
by
the
image
of
madame
arnoux
he
felt
a
longing
to
run
in
order
to
meet
her
but
what
road
ought
he
to
take
so
that
they
might
not
pass
each
other
he
went
up
to
a
messenger
put
five
francs
into
his
hand
and
ordered
him
to
go
to
the
rue
de
paradis
to
jacques
arnoux
residence
to
enquire
if
madame
were
at
home
then
he
took
up
his
post
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
ferme
and
of
the
rue
tronchet
so
as
to
be
able
to
look
down
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
on
the
boulevard
in
the
background
of
the
scene
in
front
of
him
confused
masses
of
people
were
gliding
past
he
could
distinguish
every
now
and
then
the
aigrette
of
a
dragoon
or
a
woman
hat
and
he
strained
his
eyes
in
the
effort
to
recognise
the
wearer
a
child
in
rags
exhibiting
a
asked
him
with
a
smile
for
alms
the
man
with
the
velvet
vest
reappeared
the
porter
had
not
seen
her
going
out
what
had
kept
her
in
if
she
were
ill
he
would
have
been
told
about
it
was
it
a
visitor
nothing
was
easier
than
to
say
that
she
was
not
at
home
he
struck
his
forehead
ah
i
am
stupid
of
course
is
this
political
outbreak
that
prevented
her
from
coming
he
was
relieved
by
this
apparently
natural
explanation
then
suddenly
but
her
quarter
of
the
city
is
quiet
and
a
horrible
doubt
seized
hold
of
his
mind
suppose
she
was
not
coming
at
all
and
merely
gave
me
a
promise
in
order
to
get
rid
of
me
no
no
what
had
prevented
her
from
coming
was
no
doubt
some
extraordinary
mischance
one
of
those
occurrences
that
baffled
all
one
anticipations
in
that
case
she
would
have
written
to
him
and
he
sent
the
hotel
to
his
residence
in
the
rue
rumfort
to
find
out
whether
there
happened
to
be
a
letter
waiting
for
him
there
no
letter
had
been
brought
this
absence
of
news
reassured
him
he
drew
omens
from
the
number
of
coins
which
he
took
up
in
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
by
chance
from
the
physiognomies
of
the
and
from
the
colour
of
different
horses
and
when
the
augury
was
unfavourable
he
forced
himself
to
disbelieve
in
it
in
his
sudden
outbursts
of
rage
against
madame
arnoux
he
abused
her
in
muttering
tones
then
came
fits
of
weakness
that
nearly
made
him
swoon
followed
all
of
a
sudden
by
fresh
rebounds
of
hopefulness
she
would
make
her
appearance
presently
she
was
there
behind
his
back
he
turned
round
there
was
nobody
there
once
he
perceived
about
thirty
paces
away
a
woman
of
the
same
height
with
a
dress
of
the
same
kind
he
came
up
to
her
it
was
not
she
it
struck
five
five
six
the
were
lighted
madame
arnoux
had
not
come
the
night
before
she
had
dreamed
that
she
had
been
for
some
time
on
the
footpath
in
the
rue
tronchet
she
was
waiting
there
for
something
the
nature
of
which
she
was
not
quite
clear
about
but
which
nevertheless
was
of
great
importance
and
without
knowing
why
she
was
afraid
of
being
seen
but
a
pestiferous
little
dog
kept
barking
at
her
furiously
and
biting
at
the
hem
of
her
dress
every
time
she
shook
him
off
he
returned
stubbornly
to
the
attack
always
barking
more
violently
than
before
madame
arnoux
woke
up
the
dog
barking
continued
she
strained
her
ears
to
listen
it
came
from
her
son
room
she
rushed
to
the
spot
in
her
bare
feet
it
was
the
child
himself
who
was
coughing
his
hands
were
burning
his
face
flushed
and
his
voice
singularly
hoarse
every
minute
he
found
it
more
difficult
to
breathe
freely
she
waited
there
till
daybreak
bent
over
the
coverlet
watching
him
at
eight
the
drum
of
the
national
guard
gave
warning
to
arnoux
that
his
comrades
were
expecting
his
arrival
he
dressed
himself
quickly
and
went
away
promising
that
he
would
immediately
be
passing
the
house
of
their
doctor
colot
at
ten
when
colot
did
not
make
his
appearance
madame
arnoux
despatched
her
chambermaid
for
him
the
doctor
was
away
in
the
country
and
the
young
man
who
was
taking
his
place
had
gone
out
on
some
business
eugène
kept
his
head
on
one
side
on
the
bolster
with
contracted
eyebrows
and
dilated
nostrils
his
pale
little
face
had
become
whiter
than
the
sheets
and
there
escaped
from
his
larynx
a
wheezing
caused
by
his
oppressed
breathing
which
became
gradually
shorter
dryer
and
more
metallic
his
cough
resembled
the
noise
made
by
those
barbarous
mechanical
inventions
by
which
are
enabled
to
bark
madame
arnoux
was
seized
with
terror
she
rang
the
bell
violently
calling
out
for
help
and
exclaiming
a
doctor
a
doctor
ten
minutes
later
came
an
elderly
gentleman
in
a
white
tie
and
with
grey
whiskers
well
trimmed
he
put
several
questions
as
to
the
habits
the
age
and
the
constitution
of
the
young
patient
and
studied
the
case
with
his
head
thrown
back
he
next
wrote
out
a
prescription
the
calm
manner
of
this
old
man
was
intolerable
he
smelt
of
aromatics
she
would
have
liked
to
beat
him
he
said
he
would
come
back
in
the
evening
the
horrible
coughing
soon
began
again
sometimes
the
child
arose
suddenly
convulsive
movements
shook
the
muscles
of
his
breast
and
in
his
efforts
to
breathe
his
stomach
shrank
in
as
if
he
were
suffocating
after
running
too
hard
then
he
sank
down
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
mouth
wide
open
with
infinite
pains
madame
arnoux
tried
to
make
him
swallow
the
contents
of
the
phials
hippo
wine
and
a
potion
containing
trisulphate
of
antimony
but
he
pushed
away
the
spoon
groaning
in
a
feeble
voice
he
seemed
to
be
blowing
out
his
words
from
time
to
time
she
the
prescription
the
observations
of
the
formulary
frightened
her
perhaps
the
apothecary
had
made
some
mistake
her
powerlessness
filled
her
with
despair
colot
pupil
arrived
he
was
a
young
man
of
modest
demeanour
new
to
medical
work
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
his
opinion
about
the
case
he
was
at
first
undecided
as
to
what
he
should
do
for
fear
of
compromising
himself
and
finally
he
ordered
pieces
of
ice
to
be
applied
to
the
sick
child
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
ice
the
bladder
containing
the
ice
burst
it
was
necessary
to
change
the
little
boy
shirt
this
disturbance
brought
on
an
attack
of
even
a
more
dreadful
character
than
any
of
the
previous
ones
the
child
began
tearing
off
the
linen
round
his
neck
as
if
he
wanted
to
remove
the
obstacle
that
was
choking
him
and
he
scratched
the
walls
and
seized
the
curtains
of
his
bedstead
trying
to
get
a
point
of
support
to
assist
him
in
breathing
his
face
was
now
of
a
bluish
hue
and
his
entire
body
steeped
in
a
cold
perspiration
appeared
to
be
growing
lean
his
haggard
eyes
were
fixed
with
terror
on
his
mother
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
hung
there
in
a
desperate
fashion
and
repressing
her
rising
sobs
she
gave
utterance
in
a
broken
voice
to
loving
words
yes
my
pet
my
angel
my
treasure
then
came
intervals
of
calm
she
went
to
look
for
playthings
a
punchinello
a
collection
of
images
and
spread
them
out
on
the
bed
in
order
to
amuse
him
she
even
made
an
attempt
to
sing
she
began
to
sing
a
little
ballad
which
she
used
to
sing
years
before
when
she
was
nursing
him
wrapped
up
in
in
this
same
little
upholstered
chair
but
a
shiver
ran
all
over
his
frame
just
as
when
a
wave
is
agitated
by
the
wind
the
balls
of
his
eyes
protruded
she
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
turned
away
her
eyes
to
avoid
seeing
him
the
next
moment
she
felt
strength
enough
in
her
to
look
at
him
he
was
still
living
the
hours
succeeded
each
other
dull
mournful
interminable
hopeless
and
she
no
longer
counted
the
minutes
save
by
the
progress
of
this
mental
anguish
the
shakings
of
his
chest
threw
him
forward
as
if
to
shatter
his
body
finally
he
vomited
something
strange
which
was
like
a
parchment
tube
what
was
this
she
fancied
that
he
had
evacuated
one
end
of
his
entrails
but
he
now
began
to
breathe
freely
and
regularly
this
appearance
of
frightened
her
more
than
anything
else
that
had
happened
she
was
sitting
like
one
petrified
her
arms
hanging
by
her
sides
her
eyes
fixed
when
colot
suddenly
made
his
appearance
the
child
in
his
opinion
was
saved
she
did
not
realise
what
he
meant
at
first
and
made
him
repeat
the
words
was
not
this
one
of
those
consoling
phrases
which
were
customary
with
medical
men
the
doctor
went
away
with
an
air
of
tranquillity
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
cords
that
pressed
round
her
heart
were
loosened
saved
is
this
possible
suddenly
the
thought
of
frederick
presented
itself
to
her
mind
in
a
clear
and
inexorable
fashion
it
was
a
warning
sent
to
her
by
providence
but
the
lord
in
his
mercy
had
not
wished
to
complete
her
chastisement
what
expiation
could
she
offer
hereafter
if
she
were
to
persevere
in
this
no
doubt
insults
would
be
flung
at
her
son
head
on
her
account
and
madame
arnoux
saw
him
a
young
man
wounded
in
a
combat
carried
off
on
a
litter
dying
at
one
spring
she
threw
herself
on
the
little
chair
and
letting
her
soul
escape
towards
the
heights
of
heaven
she
vowed
to
god
that
she
would
sacrifice
as
a
holocaust
her
first
real
passion
her
only
weakness
as
a
woman
frederick
had
returned
home
he
remained
in
his
armchair
without
even
possessing
enough
of
energy
to
curse
her
a
sort
of
slumber
fell
upon
him
and
in
the
midst
of
his
nightmare
he
could
hear
the
rain
falling
still
under
the
impression
that
he
was
there
outside
on
the
footpath
next
morning
yielding
to
an
incapacity
to
resist
the
temptation
which
clung
to
him
he
again
sent
a
messenger
to
madame
arnoux
house
whether
the
true
explanation
happened
to
be
that
the
fellow
did
not
deliver
his
message
or
that
she
had
too
many
things
to
say
to
explain
herself
in
a
word
or
two
the
same
answer
was
brought
back
this
insolence
was
too
great
a
feeling
of
angry
pride
took
possession
of
him
he
swore
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
never
again
cherish
even
a
desire
and
like
a
group
of
leaves
carried
away
by
a
hurricane
his
love
disappeared
he
experienced
a
sense
of
relief
a
feeling
of
stoical
joy
then
a
need
of
violent
action
and
he
walked
on
at
random
through
the
streets
men
from
the
faubourgs
were
marching
past
armed
with
guns
and
old
swords
some
of
them
wearing
red
caps
and
all
singing
the
marseillaise
or
the
girondins
here
and
there
a
national
guard
was
hurrying
to
join
his
mayoral
department
drums
could
be
heard
rolling
in
the
distance
a
conflict
was
going
on
at
porte
there
was
something
lively
and
warlike
in
the
air
frederick
kept
walking
on
without
stopping
the
excitement
of
the
great
city
made
him
gay
on
the
frascati
hill
he
got
a
glimpse
of
the
maréchale
windows
a
wild
idea
occurred
to
him
a
reaction
of
youthfulness
he
crossed
the
boulevard
the
was
just
being
closed
and
delphine
who
was
in
the
act
of
writing
on
it
with
a
piece
of
charcoal
arms
given
said
to
him
in
an
eager
tone
ah
madame
is
in
a
nice
state
she
dismissed
a
groom
who
insulted
her
this
morning
she
thinks
there
going
to
be
pillage
everywhere
she
is
frightened
to
death
and
the
more
so
as
monsieur
has
gone
what
monsieur
the
prince
frederick
entered
the
boudoir
the
maréchale
appeared
in
her
petticoat
and
her
hair
hanging
down
her
back
in
disorder
ah
thanks
you
are
going
to
save
me
is
the
second
time
you
are
one
of
those
who
never
count
the
cost
a
thousand
pardons
said
frederick
catching
her
round
the
waist
with
both
hands
how
now
what
are
you
doing
stammered
the
maréchale
at
the
same
time
surprised
and
cheered
up
by
his
manner
he
replied
i
am
the
fashion
i
reformed
she
let
herself
fall
back
on
the
divan
and
continued
laughing
under
his
kisses
they
spent
the
afternoon
looking
out
through
the
window
at
the
people
in
the
street
then
he
brought
her
to
dine
at
the
trois
frères
provençaux
the
meal
was
a
long
and
dainty
one
they
came
back
on
foot
for
want
of
a
vehicle
at
the
announcement
of
a
change
of
ministry
paris
had
changed
everyone
was
in
a
state
of
delight
people
kept
promenading
about
the
streets
and
every
floor
was
illuminated
with
lamps
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
broad
daylight
the
soldiers
made
their
way
back
to
their
barracks
worn
out
and
looking
quite
depressed
the
people
saluted
them
with
exclamations
of
long
live
the
line
they
went
on
without
making
any
response
among
the
national
guard
on
the
contrary
the
officers
flushed
with
enthusiasm
brandished
their
sabres
vociferating
long
live
reform
and
every
time
the
two
lovers
heard
this
word
they
laughed
frederick
told
droll
stories
and
was
quite
gay
making
their
way
through
the
rue
duphot
they
reached
the
boulevards
venetian
lanterns
hanging
from
the
houses
formed
wreaths
of
flame
underneath
a
confused
swarm
of
people
kept
in
constant
motion
in
the
midst
of
those
moving
shadows
could
be
seen
here
and
there
the
steely
glitter
of
bayonets
there
was
a
great
uproar
the
crowd
was
too
compact
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
one
way
back
in
a
straight
line
they
were
entering
the
rue
caumartin
when
suddenly
there
burst
forth
behind
them
a
noise
like
the
crackling
made
by
an
immense
piece
of
silk
in
the
act
of
being
torn
across
it
was
the
discharge
of
musketry
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
ha
a
few
of
the
citizens
are
getting
a
crack
said
frederick
calmly
for
there
are
situations
in
which
a
man
of
the
least
cruel
disposition
is
so
much
detached
from
his
that
he
would
see
the
entire
human
race
perishing
without
a
single
throb
of
the
heart
the
maréchale
was
clinging
to
his
arm
with
her
teeth
chattering
she
declared
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
walk
twenty
steps
further
then
by
a
refinement
of
hatred
in
order
the
better
to
offer
an
outrage
in
his
own
soul
to
madame
arnoux
he
led
rosanette
to
the
hotel
in
the
rue
tronchet
and
brought
her
up
to
the
room
which
he
had
got
ready
for
the
other
the
flowers
were
not
withered
the
guipure
was
spread
out
on
the
bed
he
drew
forth
from
the
cupboard
the
little
slippers
rosanette
considered
this
forethought
on
his
part
a
great
proof
of
his
delicacy
of
sentiment
about
one
she
was
awakened
by
distant
rolling
sounds
and
she
saw
that
he
was
sobbing
with
his
head
buried
in
the
pillow
what
the
matter
with
you
now
my
own
darling
is
the
excess
of
happiness
said
frederick
i
have
been
too
long
yearning
after
you
chapter
xiv
the
barricade
he
was
abruptly
roused
from
sleep
by
the
noise
of
a
discharge
of
musketry
and
in
spite
of
rosanette
entreaties
frederick
was
fully
determined
to
go
and
see
what
was
happening
he
hurried
down
to
the
from
which
shots
were
being
fired
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
some
men
in
blouses
ran
past
him
exclaiming
no
not
that
way
to
the
frederick
followed
them
the
grating
of
the
convent
of
the
assumption
had
been
torn
away
a
little
further
on
he
noticed
three
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
beginning
of
a
barricade
no
doubt
then
fragments
of
bottles
and
bundles
of
to
obstruct
the
cavalry
and
at
the
same
moment
there
rushed
suddenly
out
of
a
lane
a
tall
young
man
of
pale
complexion
with
his
black
hair
flowing
over
his
shoulders
and
with
a
sort
of
thrown
round
him
in
his
hand
he
held
a
long
military
musket
and
he
dashed
along
on
the
tips
of
his
slippers
with
the
air
of
a
somnambulist
and
with
the
nimbleness
of
a
tiger
at
intervals
a
detonation
could
be
heard
on
the
evening
of
the
day
before
the
spectacle
of
the
wagon
containing
five
corpses
picked
up
from
amongst
those
that
were
lying
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
had
charged
the
disposition
of
the
people
and
while
at
the
tuileries
the
succeeded
each
other
and
molé
having
set
about
the
composition
of
a
new
cabinet
did
not
come
back
and
thiers
was
making
efforts
to
constitute
another
and
while
the
king
was
cavilling
and
hesitating
and
finally
assigned
the
post
of
to
bugeaud
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
making
use
of
it
the
insurrection
was
organising
itself
in
a
formidable
manner
as
if
it
were
directed
by
a
single
arm
men
endowed
with
a
kind
of
frantic
eloquence
were
engaged
in
haranguing
the
populace
at
the
others
were
in
the
churches
ringing
the
tocsin
as
loudly
as
ever
they
could
lead
was
cast
for
bullets
cartridges
were
rolled
about
the
trees
on
the
boulevards
the
urinals
the
benches
the
gratings
the
everything
was
torn
off
and
thrown
down
paris
that
morning
was
covered
with
barricades
the
resistance
which
was
offered
was
of
short
duration
so
that
at
eight
the
people
by
voluntary
surrender
or
by
force
had
got
possession
of
five
barracks
nearly
all
the
municipal
buildings
the
most
favourable
strategic
points
of
its
own
accord
without
any
effort
the
monarchy
was
melting
away
in
rapid
dissolution
and
now
an
attack
was
made
on
the
of
the
château
in
order
to
liberate
fifty
prisoners
who
were
not
there
frederick
was
forced
to
stop
at
the
entrance
to
the
square
it
was
filled
with
groups
of
armed
men
the
rue
and
the
rue
fromanteau
were
occupied
by
companies
of
the
line
the
rue
de
valois
was
choked
up
by
an
enormous
barricade
the
smoke
which
fluttered
about
at
the
top
of
it
partly
opened
men
kept
running
overhead
making
violent
gestures
they
vanished
from
sight
then
the
firing
was
again
renewed
it
was
answered
from
the
without
anyone
being
seen
inside
its
windows
protected
by
oaken
were
pierced
with
and
the
monument
with
its
two
storys
its
two
wings
its
fountain
on
the
first
floor
and
its
little
door
in
the
centre
was
beginning
to
be
speckled
with
white
spots
under
the
shock
of
the
bullets
the
three
steps
in
front
of
it
remained
unoccupied
at
frederick
side
a
man
in
a
greek
cap
with
a
over
his
knitted
vest
was
holding
a
dispute
with
a
woman
with
a
madras
neckerchief
round
her
shoulders
she
said
to
him
come
back
now
come
back
leave
me
alone
replied
the
husband
you
can
easily
mind
the
lodge
by
yourself
i
ask
citizen
is
this
fair
i
have
on
every
occasion
done
my
duty
in
in
in
and
in
they
fighting
again
i
must
fight
go
away
and
the
porter
wife
ended
by
yielding
to
his
remonstrances
and
to
those
of
a
national
guard
near
them
a
man
of
forty
whose
simple
face
was
adorned
with
a
circle
of
white
beard
he
loaded
his
gun
and
fired
while
talking
to
frederick
as
cool
in
the
midst
of
the
outbreak
as
a
horticulturist
in
his
garden
a
young
lad
with
a
thrown
over
him
was
trying
to
coax
this
man
to
give
him
a
few
caps
so
that
he
might
make
use
of
a
gun
he
had
a
fine
which
a
gentleman
had
made
him
a
present
of
catch
on
behind
my
back
said
the
good
man
and
keep
yourself
from
being
seen
or
you
get
yourself
killed
the
drums
beat
for
the
charge
sharp
cries
hurrahs
of
triumph
burst
forth
a
continual
ebbing
to
and
fro
made
the
multitude
sway
backward
and
forward
frederick
caught
between
two
thick
masses
of
people
did
not
move
an
inch
all
the
time
fascinated
and
exceedingly
amused
by
the
scene
around
him
the
wounded
who
sank
to
the
ground
the
dead
lying
at
his
feet
did
not
seem
like
persons
really
wounded
or
really
dead
the
impression
left
on
his
mind
was
that
he
was
looking
on
at
a
show
in
the
midst
of
the
surging
throng
above
the
sea
of
heads
could
be
seen
an
old
man
in
a
black
coat
mounted
on
a
white
horse
with
a
velvet
saddle
he
held
in
one
hand
a
green
bough
in
the
other
a
paper
and
he
kept
shaking
them
persistently
but
at
length
giving
up
all
hope
of
obtaining
a
hearing
he
withdrew
from
the
scene
the
soldiers
of
the
line
had
gone
and
only
the
municipal
troops
remained
to
defend
the
a
wave
of
dauntless
spirits
dashed
up
the
steps
they
were
flung
down
others
came
on
to
replace
them
and
the
gate
resounded
under
blows
from
iron
bars
the
municipal
guards
did
not
give
way
but
a
wagon
stuffed
full
of
hay
and
burning
like
a
gigantic
torch
was
dragged
against
the
walls
faggots
were
speedily
brought
then
straw
and
a
barrel
of
spirits
of
wine
the
fire
mounted
up
to
the
stones
along
the
wall
the
building
began
to
send
forth
smoke
on
all
sides
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
and
at
its
summit
between
the
balustrades
of
the
terrace
huge
flames
escaped
with
a
harsh
noise
the
first
story
of
the
was
occupied
by
national
guards
shots
were
fired
through
every
window
in
the
square
the
bullets
whizzed
the
water
of
the
fountain
which
had
burst
was
mingled
with
the
blood
forming
little
pools
on
the
ground
people
slipped
in
the
mud
over
clothes
shakos
and
weapons
frederick
felt
something
soft
under
his
foot
it
was
the
hand
of
a
sergeant
in
a
grey
lying
on
his
face
in
the
stream
that
ran
along
the
street
fresh
bands
of
people
were
continually
coming
up
pushing
on
the
combatants
at
the
the
firing
became
quicker
the
were
open
people
went
into
them
from
time
to
time
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
drink
a
glass
of
beer
and
then
came
back
again
to
fight
a
lost
dog
began
to
howl
this
made
the
people
laugh
frederick
was
shaken
by
the
impact
of
a
man
falling
on
his
shoulder
with
a
bullet
through
his
back
and
the
in
his
throat
at
this
shot
perhaps
directed
against
himself
he
felt
himself
stirred
up
to
rage
and
he
was
plunging
forward
when
a
national
guard
stopped
him
is
useless
the
king
has
just
gone
ah
if
you
do
believe
me
go
and
see
for
yourself
this
assurance
calmed
frederick
the
place
du
carrousel
had
a
tranquil
aspect
the
hôtel
de
nantes
stood
there
as
fixed
as
ever
and
the
houses
in
the
rear
the
dome
of
the
louvre
in
front
the
long
gallery
of
wood
at
the
right
and
the
waste
plot
of
ground
that
ran
unevenly
as
far
as
the
sheds
of
the
were
so
to
speak
steeped
in
the
grey
hues
of
the
atmosphere
where
indistinct
murmurs
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
fog
while
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
a
stiff
light
falling
through
the
parting
of
the
clouds
on
the
façade
of
the
tuileries
cut
out
all
its
windows
into
white
patches
near
the
arc
de
triomphe
a
dead
horse
lay
on
the
ground
behind
the
gratings
groups
consisting
of
five
or
six
persons
were
chatting
the
doors
leading
into
the
château
were
open
and
the
servants
at
the
thresholds
allowed
the
people
to
enter
below
stairs
in
a
kind
of
little
parlour
bowls
of
au
were
handed
round
a
few
of
those
present
sat
down
to
the
table
and
made
merry
others
remained
standing
and
amongst
the
latter
was
a
he
snatched
up
with
both
hands
a
glass
vessel
full
of
powdered
sugar
cast
a
restless
glance
right
and
left
and
then
began
to
eat
voraciously
with
his
nose
stuck
into
the
mouth
of
the
vessel
at
the
bottom
of
the
great
staircase
a
man
was
writing
his
name
in
a
register
frederick
was
able
to
recognise
him
by
his
back
hallo
hussonnet
yes
is
i
replied
the
bohemian
i
am
introducing
myself
at
court
this
is
a
nice
joke
is
it
suppose
we
go
upstairs
and
they
reached
presently
the
salle
des
maréchaux
the
portraits
of
those
illustrious
generals
save
that
of
bugeaud
which
had
been
pierced
through
the
stomach
were
all
intact
they
were
represented
leaning
on
their
sabres
with
a
behind
each
of
them
and
in
formidable
attitudes
in
contrast
with
the
occasion
a
large
timepiece
proclaimed
it
was
twenty
minutes
past
one
suddenly
the
marseillaise
resounded
hussonnet
and
frederick
bent
over
the
balusters
it
was
the
people
they
rushed
up
the
stairs
shaking
with
a
dizzying
motion
bare
heads
or
helmets
or
red
caps
or
else
bayonets
or
human
shoulders
with
such
impetuosity
that
some
people
disappeared
every
now
and
then
in
this
swarming
mass
which
was
mounting
up
without
a
moment
pause
like
a
river
compressed
by
an
equinoctial
tide
with
a
continuous
roar
under
an
irresistible
impulse
when
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
they
were
scattered
and
their
chant
died
away
nothing
could
any
longer
be
heard
but
the
tramp
of
all
the
shoes
intermingled
with
the
chopping
sound
of
many
voices
the
crowd
not
being
in
a
mischievous
mood
contented
themselves
with
looking
about
them
but
from
time
to
time
an
elbow
by
pressing
too
hard
broke
through
a
pane
of
glass
or
else
a
vase
or
a
statue
rolled
from
a
bracket
down
on
the
floor
the
wainscotings
cracked
under
the
pressure
of
people
against
them
every
face
was
flushed
the
perspiration
was
rolling
down
their
features
in
large
beads
hussonnet
made
this
remark
heroes
have
not
a
good
smell
ah
you
are
provoking
returned
frederick
and
pushed
forward
in
spite
of
themselves
they
entered
an
apartment
in
which
a
dais
of
red
velvet
rose
as
far
as
the
ceiling
on
the
throne
below
sat
a
representative
of
the
proletariat
in
effigy
with
a
black
beard
his
shirt
gaping
open
a
jolly
air
and
the
stupid
look
of
a
baboon
others
climbed
up
the
platform
to
sit
in
his
place
what
a
myth
said
hussonnet
there
you
see
the
sovereign
people
the
armchair
was
lifted
up
on
the
hands
of
a
number
of
persons
and
passed
across
the
hall
swaying
from
one
side
to
the
other
by
jove
is
like
a
boat
the
ship
of
state
is
tossing
about
in
a
stormy
sea
let
it
dance
the
cancan
let
it
dance
the
cancan
they
had
drawn
it
towards
a
window
and
in
the
midst
of
hisses
they
launched
it
out
poor
old
chap
said
hussonnet
as
he
saw
the
effigy
falling
into
the
garden
where
it
was
speedily
picked
up
in
order
to
be
afterwards
carried
to
the
bastille
and
burned
then
a
frantic
joy
burst
forth
as
if
instead
of
the
throne
a
future
of
boundless
happiness
had
appeared
and
the
people
less
through
a
spirit
of
vindictiveness
than
to
assert
their
right
of
possession
broke
or
tore
the
glasses
the
curtains
the
lustres
the
tapers
the
tables
the
chairs
the
stools
the
entire
furniture
including
the
very
albums
and
engravings
and
the
corbels
of
the
tapestry
since
they
had
triumphed
they
must
needs
amuse
themselves
the
common
herd
ironically
wrapped
themselves
up
in
laces
and
cashmeres
gold
fringes
were
rolled
round
the
sleeves
of
blouses
hats
with
ostriches
feathers
adorned
blacksmiths
heads
and
ribbons
of
the
legion
of
honour
supplied
waistbands
for
prostitutes
each
person
satisfied
his
or
her
caprice
some
danced
others
drank
in
the
queen
apartment
a
woman
gave
a
gloss
to
her
hair
with
pomatum
behind
a
two
lovers
were
playing
cards
hussonnet
pointed
out
to
frederick
an
individual
who
was
smoking
a
dirty
pipe
with
his
elbows
resting
on
a
balcony
and
the
popular
frenzy
redoubled
with
a
continuous
crash
of
broken
porcelain
and
pieces
of
crystal
which
as
they
rebounded
made
sounds
resembling
those
produced
by
the
plates
of
musical
glasses
then
their
fury
was
overshadowed
a
nauseous
curiosity
made
them
rummage
all
the
all
the
recesses
returned
convicts
thrust
their
arms
into
the
beds
in
which
princesses
had
slept
and
rolled
themselves
on
the
top
of
them
to
console
themselves
for
not
being
able
to
embrace
their
owners
others
with
sinister
faces
roamed
about
silently
looking
for
something
to
steal
but
too
great
a
multitude
was
there
through
the
bays
of
the
doors
could
be
seen
in
the
suite
of
apartments
only
the
dark
mass
of
people
between
the
gilding
of
the
walls
under
a
cloud
of
dust
every
breast
was
panting
the
heat
became
more
and
more
suffocating
and
the
two
friends
afraid
of
being
stifled
seized
the
opportunity
of
making
their
way
out
in
the
antechamber
standing
on
a
heap
of
garments
appeared
a
girl
of
the
town
as
a
statue
of
liberty
motionless
her
grey
eyes
wide
open
a
fearful
sight
they
had
taken
three
steps
outside
the
château
when
a
company
of
the
national
guards
in
advanced
towards
them
and
taking
off
their
and
at
the
same
time
uncovering
their
skulls
which
were
slightly
bald
bowed
very
low
to
the
people
at
this
testimony
of
respect
the
ragged
victors
bridled
up
hussonnet
and
frederick
were
not
without
experiencing
a
certain
pleasure
from
it
as
well
as
the
rest
they
were
filled
with
ardour
they
went
back
to
the
in
front
of
the
rue
fromanteau
soldiers
corpses
were
heaped
up
on
the
straw
they
passed
close
to
the
dead
without
a
single
quiver
of
emotion
feeling
a
certain
pride
in
being
able
to
keep
their
countenance
the
palais
overflowed
with
people
in
the
inner
courtyard
seven
piles
of
wood
were
flaming
pianos
chests
of
drawers
and
clocks
were
hurled
out
through
the
windows
sent
streams
of
water
up
to
the
roofs
some
vagabonds
tried
to
cut
the
hose
with
their
sabres
frederick
urged
a
pupil
of
the
polytechnic
school
to
interfere
the
latter
did
not
understand
him
and
moreover
appeared
to
be
an
idiot
all
around
in
the
two
galleries
the
populace
having
got
possession
of
the
cellars
gave
themselves
up
to
a
horrible
carouse
wine
flowed
in
streams
and
wetted
people
feet
the
mudlarks
drank
out
of
the
of
the
bottles
and
shouted
as
they
staggered
along
come
away
out
of
this
said
hussonnet
i
am
disgusted
with
the
people
all
over
the
orléans
gallery
the
wounded
lay
on
mattresses
on
the
ground
with
purple
curtains
folded
round
them
as
coverlets
and
the
small
shopkeepers
wives
and
daughters
from
the
quarter
brought
them
broth
and
linen
no
matter
said
frederick
for
my
part
i
consider
the
people
sublime
the
great
vestibule
was
filled
with
a
whirlwind
of
furious
individuals
men
tried
to
ascend
to
the
upper
storys
in
order
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
work
of
wholesale
destruction
national
guards
on
the
steps
strove
to
keep
them
back
the
most
intrepid
was
a
chasseur
who
had
his
head
bare
his
hair
bristling
and
his
straps
in
pieces
his
shirt
caused
a
swelling
between
his
trousers
and
his
coat
and
he
struggled
desperately
in
the
midst
of
the
others
hussonnet
who
had
sharp
sight
recognised
arnoux
from
a
distance
then
they
went
into
the
tuileries
garden
so
as
to
be
able
to
breathe
more
freely
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
they
remained
for
some
minutes
with
their
eyes
closed
so
much
stunned
that
they
had
not
the
energy
to
say
a
word
the
people
who
were
passing
came
up
to
them
and
informed
them
that
the
duchesse
had
been
appointed
regent
and
that
it
was
all
over
they
were
experiencing
that
species
of
comfort
which
follows
rapid
when
at
the
windows
of
the
attics
in
the
château
appeared
tearing
their
liveries
to
pieces
they
flung
their
torn
clothes
into
the
garden
as
a
mark
of
renunciation
the
people
hooted
at
them
and
then
they
retired
the
attention
of
frederick
and
hussonnet
was
distracted
by
a
tall
fellow
who
was
walking
quickly
between
the
trees
with
a
musket
on
his
shoulder
a
was
pressed
against
his
a
handkerchief
was
wound
round
his
forehead
under
his
cap
he
turned
his
head
to
one
side
it
was
dussardier
and
casting
himself
into
their
arms
ah
what
good
fortune
my
poor
old
friends
without
being
able
to
say
another
word
so
much
out
of
breath
was
he
with
fatigue
he
had
been
on
his
legs
for
the
last
hours
he
had
been
engaged
at
the
barricades
of
the
latin
quarter
had
fought
in
the
rue
rabuteau
had
saved
three
dragoons
lives
had
entered
the
tuileries
with
colonel
dunoyer
and
after
that
had
repaired
to
the
chamber
and
then
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
i
have
come
from
it
all
goes
well
the
people
are
victorious
the
workmen
and
the
employers
are
embracing
one
another
ha
if
you
knew
what
i
have
seen
what
brave
fellows
what
a
fine
sight
it
was
and
without
noticing
that
they
had
no
arms
i
was
quite
certain
of
finding
you
there
this
has
been
a
bit
rough
no
matter
a
drop
of
blood
ran
down
his
cheek
and
in
answer
to
the
questions
put
to
him
by
the
two
others
oh
is
nothing
a
slight
scratch
from
a
bayonet
however
you
really
ought
to
take
care
of
yourself
pooh
i
am
substantial
what
does
this
signify
the
republic
is
proclaimed
we
be
happy
henceforth
some
journalists
who
were
talking
just
now
in
front
of
me
said
they
were
going
to
liberate
poland
and
italy
no
more
kings
you
understand
the
entire
land
free
the
entire
land
free
and
with
one
comprehensive
glance
at
the
horizon
he
spread
out
his
arms
in
a
triumphant
attitude
but
a
long
file
of
men
rushed
over
the
terrace
on
the
water
edge
ah
deuce
take
it
i
was
forgetting
i
must
be
off
he
turned
round
to
cry
out
to
them
while
brandishing
his
musket
long
live
the
republic
from
the
chimneys
of
the
château
escaped
enormous
whirlwinds
of
black
smoke
which
bore
sparks
along
with
them
the
ringing
of
the
bells
sent
out
over
the
city
a
wild
and
startling
alarm
right
and
left
in
every
direction
the
conquerors
discharged
their
weapons
frederick
though
he
was
not
a
warrior
felt
the
gallic
blood
leaping
in
his
veins
the
magnetism
of
the
public
enthusiasm
had
seized
hold
of
him
he
inhaled
with
a
voluptuous
delight
the
stormy
atmosphere
filled
with
the
odour
of
gunpowder
and
in
the
meantime
he
quivered
under
the
effluvium
of
an
immense
love
a
supreme
and
universal
tenderness
as
if
the
heart
of
all
humanity
were
throbbing
in
his
breast
hussonnet
said
with
a
yawn
it
would
be
time
perhaps
to
go
and
instruct
the
populace
frederick
followed
him
to
his
in
the
place
de
la
bourse
and
he
began
to
compose
for
the
troyes
newspaper
an
account
of
recent
events
in
a
lyric
style
a
veritable
to
which
he
attached
his
signature
then
they
dined
together
at
a
tavern
hussonnet
was
pensive
the
eccentricities
of
the
revolution
exceeded
his
own
after
leaving
the
café
when
they
repaired
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
to
learn
the
news
the
boyish
impulses
which
were
natural
to
him
had
got
the
upper
hand
once
more
he
scaled
the
barricades
like
a
chamois
and
answered
the
sentinels
with
broad
jokes
of
a
patriotic
flavour
they
heard
the
provisional
government
proclaimed
by
torchlight
at
last
frederick
got
back
to
his
house
at
midnight
overcome
with
fatigue
well
said
he
to
his
while
the
latter
was
undressing
him
are
you
satisfied
yes
no
doubt
monsieur
but
i
do
like
to
see
the
people
dancing
to
music
next
morning
when
he
awoke
frederick
thought
of
deslauriers
he
hastened
to
his
friend
lodgings
he
ascertained
that
the
advocate
had
just
left
paris
having
been
appointed
a
provincial
commissioner
at
the
given
the
night
before
he
had
got
into
contact
with
and
laying
siege
to
him
in
the
name
of
the
law
schools
had
snatched
from
him
a
post
a
mission
however
the
doorkeeper
explained
he
was
going
to
write
and
give
his
address
in
the
following
week
after
this
frederick
went
to
see
the
maréchale
she
gave
him
a
chilling
reception
she
resented
his
desertion
of
her
her
bitterness
disappeared
when
he
had
given
her
repeated
assurances
that
peace
was
restored
all
was
quiet
now
there
was
no
reason
to
be
afraid
he
kissed
her
and
she
declared
herself
in
favour
of
the
republic
as
his
lordship
the
archbishop
of
paris
had
already
done
and
as
the
magistracy
the
council
of
state
the
institute
the
marshals
of
france
changarnier
de
falloux
all
the
bonapartists
all
the
legitimists
and
a
considerable
number
of
orléanists
were
about
to
do
with
a
swiftness
indicative
of
marvellous
zeal
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
had
been
so
rapid
that
as
soon
as
the
first
stupefaction
that
succeeded
it
had
passed
away
there
was
amongst
the
middle
class
a
feeling
of
astonishment
at
the
fact
that
they
were
still
alive
the
summary
execution
of
some
thieves
who
were
shot
without
a
trial
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
signal
justice
for
a
month
phrase
was
repeated
with
reference
to
the
red
flag
which
had
only
gone
the
round
of
the
champ
de
mars
while
the
tricoloured
flag
etc
and
all
ranged
themselves
under
its
shade
each
party
seeing
amongst
the
three
colours
only
its
own
and
firmly
determined
as
soon
as
it
would
be
the
most
powerful
to
tear
away
the
two
others
as
business
was
suspended
anxiety
and
love
of
gaping
drove
everyone
into
the
open
air
the
careless
style
of
costume
generally
adopted
attenuated
differences
of
social
position
hatred
masked
itself
expectations
were
openly
indulged
in
the
multitude
seemed
full
of
the
pride
of
having
gained
their
rights
shone
in
the
people
faces
they
displayed
the
gaiety
of
a
carnival
the
manners
of
a
bivouac
nothing
could
be
more
amusing
than
the
aspect
of
paris
during
the
first
days
that
followed
the
revolution
frederick
gave
the
maréchale
his
arm
and
they
strolled
along
through
the
streets
together
she
was
highly
diverted
by
the
display
of
rosettes
in
every
buttonhole
by
the
banners
hung
from
every
window
and
the
bills
of
every
colour
that
were
posted
upon
the
walls
and
threw
some
money
here
and
there
into
the
for
the
wounded
which
were
placed
on
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
pathway
then
she
stopped
before
some
caricatures
representing
louis
philippe
as
a
as
a
mountebank
as
a
dog
or
as
a
leech
but
she
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
sight
of
caussidière
men
with
their
sabres
and
scarfs
at
other
times
it
was
a
tree
of
liberty
that
was
being
planted
the
clergy
vied
with
each
other
in
blessing
the
republic
escorted
by
servants
in
gold
lace
and
the
populace
thought
this
very
fine
the
most
frequent
spectacle
was
that
of
deputations
from
no
matter
what
going
to
demand
something
at
the
hôtel
de
ville
for
every
trade
every
industry
was
looking
to
the
government
to
put
a
complete
end
to
its
wretchedness
some
of
them
it
is
true
went
to
offer
it
advice
or
to
congratulate
it
or
merely
to
pay
it
a
little
visit
and
to
see
the
machine
performing
its
functions
one
day
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
march
as
they
were
passing
the
pont
having
to
do
some
commission
for
rosanette
in
the
latin
quarter
frederick
saw
approaching
a
column
of
individuals
with
hats
and
long
beards
at
its
head
beating
a
drum
walked
a
negro
who
had
formerly
been
an
artist
model
and
the
man
who
bore
the
banner
on
which
this
inscription
floated
in
the
wind
was
no
other
than
pellerin
he
made
a
sign
to
frederick
to
wait
for
him
and
then
reappeared
five
minutes
afterwards
having
some
time
before
him
for
the
government
was
at
that
moment
receiving
a
deputation
from
the
he
was
going
with
his
colleagues
to
ask
for
the
creation
of
a
forum
of
art
a
kind
of
exchange
where
the
interests
of
æsthetics
would
be
discussed
sublime
masterpieces
would
be
produced
inasmuch
as
the
workers
would
amalgamate
their
talents
ere
long
paris
would
be
covered
with
gigantic
monuments
he
would
decorate
them
he
had
even
begun
a
figure
of
the
republic
one
of
his
comrades
had
come
to
take
it
for
they
were
closely
pursued
by
the
deputation
from
the
poulterers
what
stupidity
growled
a
voice
in
the
crowd
always
some
humbug
nothing
strong
it
was
regimbart
he
did
not
salute
frederick
but
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
give
vent
to
his
own
bitterness
the
citizen
spent
his
days
wandering
about
the
streets
pulling
his
moustache
rolling
his
eyes
about
accepting
and
propagating
any
dismal
news
that
was
communicated
to
him
and
he
had
only
two
phrases
take
care
we
going
to
be
run
over
or
else
why
confound
it
juggling
with
the
republic
he
was
discontented
with
everything
and
especially
with
the
fact
that
we
had
not
taken
back
our
natural
frontiers
the
very
name
of
lamartine
made
him
shrug
his
shoulders
he
did
not
consider
sufficient
for
the
problem
referred
to
dupont
of
the
eure
as
an
old
numbskull
albert
as
an
idiot
louis
blanc
as
an
utopist
and
blanqui
as
an
exceedingly
dangerous
man
and
when
frederick
asked
him
what
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
he
replied
pressing
his
arm
till
he
nearly
bruised
it
to
take
the
rhine
i
tell
you
to
take
the
rhine
damn
it
then
he
blamed
the
reactionaries
they
were
taking
off
the
mask
the
sack
of
the
château
of
neuilly
and
suresne
the
fire
at
batignolles
the
troubles
at
lyons
all
the
excesses
and
all
the
grievances
were
just
now
being
exaggerated
by
having
superadded
to
them
circular
the
forced
currency
of
the
fall
of
the
funds
to
sixty
francs
and
to
crown
all
as
the
supreme
iniquity
a
final
blow
a
culminating
horror
the
duty
of
centimes
and
over
and
above
all
these
things
there
was
again
socialism
although
these
theories
as
new
as
the
game
of
goose
had
been
discussed
sufficiently
for
forty
years
to
fill
a
number
of
libraries
they
terrified
the
wealthier
citizens
as
if
they
had
been
a
hailstorm
of
aërolites
and
they
expressed
indignation
at
them
by
virtue
of
that
hatred
which
the
advent
of
every
idea
provokes
simply
because
it
is
an
idea
an
odium
from
which
it
derives
subsequently
its
glory
and
which
causes
its
enemies
to
be
always
beneath
it
however
lowly
it
may
be
then
property
rose
in
their
regard
to
the
level
of
religion
and
was
confounded
with
god
the
attacks
made
on
it
appeared
to
them
a
sacrilege
almost
a
species
of
cannibalism
in
spite
of
the
most
humane
legislation
that
ever
existed
the
spectre
of
reappeared
and
the
chopper
of
the
guillotine
vibrated
in
every
syllable
of
the
word
republic
which
did
not
prevent
them
from
despising
it
for
its
weakness
france
no
longer
feeling
herself
mistress
of
the
situation
was
beginning
to
shriek
with
terror
like
a
blind
man
without
his
stick
or
an
infant
that
had
lost
its
nurse
of
all
frenchmen
dambreuse
was
the
most
alarmed
the
new
condition
of
things
threatened
his
fortune
but
more
than
anything
else
it
deceived
his
experience
a
system
so
good
a
king
so
wise
was
it
possible
the
ground
was
giving
way
beneath
their
feet
next
morning
he
dismissed
three
of
his
servants
sold
his
horses
bought
a
soft
hat
to
go
out
into
the
streets
thought
even
of
letting
his
beard
grow
and
he
remained
at
home
prostrated
reading
over
and
over
again
newspapers
most
hostile
to
his
own
ideas
and
plunged
into
such
a
gloomy
mood
that
even
the
jokes
about
the
pipe
of
flocon
f
had
not
the
power
to
make
him
smile
as
a
supporter
of
the
last
reign
he
was
dreading
the
vengeance
of
the
people
so
far
as
concerned
his
estates
in
champagne
when
lucubration
fell
into
his
hands
then
it
occurred
to
his
mind
that
his
young
friend
was
a
very
useful
personage
and
that
he
might
be
able
if
not
to
serve
him
at
least
to
protect
him
so
that
one
morning
dambreuse
presented
himself
at
frederick
residence
accompanied
by
martinon
f
this
is
another
political
allusion
flocon
was
a
member
of
the
ministry
of
the
translator
this
visit
he
said
had
no
object
save
that
of
seeing
him
for
a
little
while
and
having
a
chat
with
him
in
short
he
rejoiced
at
the
events
that
had
happened
and
with
his
whole
heart
adopted
our
sublime
motto
equality
and
having
always
been
at
bottom
a
republican
if
he
voted
under
the
other
with
the
ministry
it
was
simply
in
order
to
accelerate
an
inevitable
downfall
he
even
inveighed
against
guizot
who
has
got
us
into
a
nice
hobble
we
must
admit
by
way
of
retaliation
he
spoke
in
an
enthusiastic
fashion
about
lamartine
who
had
shown
himself
magnificent
upon
my
word
of
honour
when
with
reference
to
the
red
flag
yes
i
know
said
frederick
after
which
he
declared
that
his
sympathies
were
on
the
side
of
the
for
in
fact
more
or
less
we
are
all
and
he
carried
his
impartiality
so
far
as
to
acknowledge
that
proudhon
had
a
certain
amount
of
logic
in
his
views
oh
a
great
deal
of
logic
deuce
take
it
then
with
the
disinterestedness
of
a
superior
mind
he
chatted
about
the
exhibition
of
pictures
at
which
he
had
seen
pellerin
work
he
considered
it
original
and
martinon
backed
up
all
he
said
with
expressions
of
approval
and
likewise
was
of
his
opinion
that
it
was
necessary
to
rally
boldly
to
the
side
of
the
republic
and
he
talked
about
the
husbandman
his
father
and
assumed
the
part
of
the
peasant
the
man
of
the
people
they
soon
came
to
the
question
of
the
elections
for
the
national
assembly
and
the
candidates
in
the
arrondissement
of
la
fortelle
the
opposition
candidate
had
no
chance
you
should
take
his
place
said
dambreuse
frederick
protested
but
why
not
for
he
would
obtain
the
suffrages
of
the
extremists
owing
to
his
personal
opinions
and
that
of
the
conservatives
on
account
of
his
family
and
perhaps
also
added
the
banker
with
a
smile
thanks
to
my
influence
in
some
measure
frederick
urged
as
an
obstacle
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
it
there
was
nothing
easier
if
he
only
got
himself
recommended
to
the
patriots
of
the
aube
by
one
of
the
clubs
of
the
capital
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
read
out
not
a
profession
of
faith
such
as
might
be
seen
every
day
but
a
serious
statement
of
principles
bring
it
to
me
i
know
what
goes
down
in
the
locality
and
you
can
i
say
again
render
great
services
to
the
country
to
us
all
to
myself
in
such
times
people
ought
to
aid
each
other
and
if
frederick
had
need
of
anything
he
or
his
friends
oh
a
thousand
thanks
my
dear
monsieur
you
do
as
much
for
me
in
return
mind
decidedly
the
banker
was
a
decent
man
frederick
could
not
refrain
from
pondering
over
his
advice
and
soon
he
was
dazzled
by
a
kind
of
dizziness
the
great
figures
of
the
convention
passed
before
his
mental
vision
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
splendid
dawn
was
about
to
rise
rome
vienna
and
berlin
were
in
a
state
of
insurrection
and
the
austrians
had
been
driven
out
of
venice
all
europe
was
agitated
now
was
the
time
to
make
a
plunge
into
the
movement
and
perhaps
to
accelerate
it
and
then
he
was
fascinated
by
the
costume
which
it
was
said
the
deputies
would
wear
already
he
saw
himself
in
a
waistcoat
with
lapels
and
a
tricoloured
sash
and
this
itching
this
hallucination
became
so
violent
that
he
opened
his
mind
to
dambreuse
the
honest
fellow
enthusiasm
had
not
abated
certainly
sure
enough
offer
yourself
frederick
nevertheless
consulted
deslauriers
the
idiotic
opposition
which
trammelled
the
commissioner
in
his
province
had
augmented
his
liberalism
he
at
once
replied
exhorting
frederick
with
the
utmost
vehemence
to
come
forward
as
a
candidate
however
as
the
latter
was
desirous
of
having
the
approval
of
a
great
number
of
persons
he
confided
the
thing
to
rosanette
one
day
when
mademoiselle
vatnaz
happened
to
be
present
she
was
one
of
those
parisian
spinsters
who
every
evening
when
they
have
given
their
lessons
or
tried
to
sell
little
sketches
or
to
dispose
of
poor
manuscripts
return
to
their
own
homes
with
mud
on
their
petticoats
make
their
own
dinner
which
they
eat
by
themselves
and
then
with
their
soles
resting
on
a
by
the
light
of
a
filthy
lamp
dream
of
a
love
a
family
a
hearth
wealth
all
that
they
lack
so
it
was
that
like
many
others
she
had
hailed
in
the
revolution
the
advent
of
vengeance
and
she
delivered
herself
up
to
a
socialistic
propaganda
of
the
most
unbridled
description
the
enfranchisement
of
the
proletariat
according
to
the
vatnaz
was
only
possible
by
the
enfranchisement
of
woman
she
wished
to
have
her
own
sex
admitted
to
every
kind
of
employment
to
have
an
enquiry
made
into
the
paternity
of
children
a
different
code
the
abolition
or
at
least
a
more
intelligent
regulation
of
marriage
in
that
case
every
frenchwoman
would
be
bound
to
marry
a
frenchman
or
to
adopt
an
old
man
nurses
and
midwives
should
be
officials
receiving
salaries
from
the
state
there
should
be
a
jury
to
examine
the
works
of
women
special
editors
for
women
a
polytechnic
school
for
women
a
national
guard
for
women
everything
for
women
and
since
the
government
ignored
their
rights
they
ought
to
overcome
force
by
force
ten
thousand
citizenesses
with
good
guns
ought
to
make
the
hôtel
de
ville
quake
frederick
candidature
appeared
to
her
favourable
for
carrying
out
her
ideas
she
encouraged
him
pointing
out
the
glory
that
shone
on
the
horizon
rosanette
was
delighted
at
the
notion
of
having
a
man
who
would
make
speeches
at
the
chamber
and
then
perhaps
they
give
you
a
good
place
frederick
a
man
prone
to
every
kind
of
weakness
was
infected
by
the
universal
mania
he
wrote
an
address
and
went
to
show
it
to
dambreuse
at
the
sound
made
by
the
great
door
falling
back
a
curtain
gaped
open
a
little
behind
a
casement
and
a
woman
appeared
at
it
he
had
not
time
to
find
out
who
she
was
but
in
the
anteroom
a
picture
arrested
his
attention
pellerin
picture
which
lay
on
a
chair
no
doubt
provisionally
it
represented
the
republic
or
progress
or
civilisation
under
the
form
of
jesus
christ
driving
a
locomotive
which
was
passing
through
a
virgin
forest
frederick
after
a
minute
contemplation
exclaimed
what
a
vile
thing
is
it
not
eh
said
dambreuse
coming
in
unexpectedly
just
at
the
moment
when
the
other
was
giving
utterance
to
this
opinion
and
fancying
that
it
had
reference
not
so
much
to
the
picture
as
to
the
doctrine
glorified
by
the
work
martinon
presented
himself
at
the
same
time
they
made
their
way
into
the
study
and
frederick
was
drawing
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
when
mademoiselle
cécile
entering
suddenly
said
articulating
her
words
in
an
ingenuous
fashion
is
my
aunt
here
you
know
well
she
is
not
replied
the
banker
no
matter
act
as
if
you
were
at
home
mademoiselle
oh
thanks
i
am
going
away
scarcely
had
she
left
when
martinon
seemed
to
be
searching
for
his
handkerchief
i
forgot
to
take
it
out
of
my
excuse
me
all
right
said
dambreuse
evidently
he
was
not
deceived
by
this
manoeuvre
and
even
seemed
to
regard
it
with
favour
why
but
martinon
soon
reappeared
and
frederick
began
reading
his
address
at
the
second
page
which
pointed
towards
the
preponderance
of
the
financial
interests
as
a
disgraceful
fact
the
banker
made
a
grimace
then
touching
on
reforms
frederick
demanded
free
trade
what
allow
me
now
the
other
paid
no
attention
and
went
on
he
called
for
a
tax
on
yearly
incomes
a
progressive
tax
a
european
federation
and
the
education
of
the
people
the
encouragement
of
the
fine
arts
on
the
liberal
scale
when
the
country
could
provide
men
like
delacroix
or
hugo
with
incomes
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
where
would
be
the
harm
at
the
close
of
the
address
advice
was
given
to
the
upper
classes
spare
nothing
ye
rich
but
give
give
he
stopped
and
remained
standing
the
two
who
had
been
listening
to
him
did
not
utter
a
word
martinon
opened
his
eyes
wide
dambreuse
was
quite
pale
at
last
concealing
his
emotion
under
a
bitter
smile
that
address
of
yours
is
simply
perfect
and
he
praised
the
style
exceedingly
in
order
to
avoid
giving
his
opinion
as
to
the
matter
of
the
address
this
virulence
on
the
part
of
an
inoffensive
young
man
frightened
him
especially
as
a
sign
of
the
times
martinon
tried
to
reassure
him
the
conservative
party
in
a
little
while
would
certainly
be
able
to
take
its
revenge
in
several
cities
the
commissioners
of
the
provisional
government
had
been
driven
away
the
elections
were
not
to
occur
till
the
of
april
there
was
plenty
of
time
in
short
it
was
necessary
for
dambreuse
to
present
himself
personally
in
the
aube
and
from
that
time
forth
martinon
no
longer
left
his
side
became
his
secretary
and
was
as
attentive
to
him
as
any
son
could
be
frederick
arrived
at
rosanette
house
in
a
very
mood
delmar
happened
to
be
there
and
told
him
of
his
intention
to
stand
as
a
candidate
at
the
seine
elections
in
a
placard
addressed
to
the
people
in
which
he
addressed
them
in
the
familiar
manner
which
one
adopts
towards
an
individual
the
actor
boasted
of
being
able
to
understand
them
and
of
having
in
order
to
save
them
got
himself
crucified
for
the
sake
of
art
so
that
he
was
the
incarnation
the
ideal
of
the
popular
spirit
believing
that
he
had
in
fact
such
enormous
power
over
the
masses
that
he
proposed
when
he
occupied
a
ministerial
office
to
quell
any
outbreak
by
himself
alone
and
with
regard
to
the
means
he
would
employ
he
gave
this
answer
never
fear
i
show
them
my
head
frederick
in
order
to
mortify
him
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
himself
a
candidate
the
mummer
from
the
moment
that
his
future
colleague
aspired
to
represent
the
province
declared
himself
his
servant
and
offered
to
be
his
guide
to
the
various
clubs
they
visited
them
or
nearly
all
the
red
and
the
blue
the
furious
and
the
tranquil
the
puritanical
and
the
licentious
the
mystical
and
the
intemperate
those
that
had
voted
for
the
death
of
kings
and
those
in
which
the
frauds
in
the
grocery
trade
had
been
denounced
and
everywhere
the
tenants
cursed
the
landlords
the
blouse
was
full
of
spite
against
broadcloth
and
the
rich
conspired
against
the
poor
many
wanted
indemnities
on
the
ground
that
they
had
formerly
been
martyrs
of
the
police
others
appealed
for
money
in
order
to
carry
out
certain
inventions
or
else
there
were
plans
of
phalansteria
projects
for
cantonal
bazaars
systems
of
public
felicity
then
here
and
there
a
flash
of
genius
amid
these
clouds
of
folly
sudden
as
splashes
the
law
formulated
by
an
oath
and
flowers
of
eloquence
on
the
lips
of
some
with
a
strapped
over
his
bare
shirtless
chest
sometimes
too
a
gentleman
made
his
appearance
an
aristocrat
of
humble
demeanour
talking
in
a
plebeian
strain
and
with
his
hands
unwashed
so
as
to
make
them
look
hard
a
patriot
recognised
him
the
most
virtuous
mobbed
him
and
he
went
off
with
rage
in
his
soul
on
the
pretext
of
good
sense
it
was
desirable
to
be
always
disparaging
the
advocates
and
to
make
use
as
often
as
possible
of
these
expressions
to
carry
his
stone
to
the
building
social
problem
workshop
delmar
did
not
miss
the
opportunities
afforded
him
for
getting
in
a
word
and
when
he
no
longer
found
anything
to
say
his
device
was
to
plant
himself
in
some
conspicuous
position
with
one
of
his
arms
akimbo
and
the
other
in
his
waistcoat
turning
himself
round
abruptly
in
profile
so
as
to
give
a
good
view
of
his
head
then
there
were
outbursts
of
applause
which
came
from
mademoiselle
vatnaz
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
frederick
in
spite
of
the
weakness
of
orators
did
not
dare
to
try
the
experiment
of
speaking
all
those
people
seemed
to
him
too
unpolished
or
too
hostile
but
dussardier
made
enquiries
and
informed
him
that
there
existed
in
the
rue
a
club
which
bore
the
name
of
the
club
of
intellect
such
a
name
gave
good
reason
for
hope
besides
he
would
bring
some
friends
there
he
brought
those
whom
he
had
invited
to
take
punch
with
him
the
bookkeeper
the
traveller
in
wines
and
the
architect
even
pellerin
had
offered
to
come
and
hussonnet
would
probably
form
one
of
the
party
and
on
the
footpath
before
the
door
stood
regimbart
with
two
individuals
the
first
of
whom
was
his
faithful
compain
a
rather
man
marked
with
and
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
the
second
an
negro
exceedingly
hairy
and
whom
he
knew
only
in
the
character
of
a
patriot
from
barcelona
they
passed
though
a
passage
and
were
then
introduced
into
a
large
room
no
doubt
used
by
a
joiner
and
with
walls
still
fresh
and
smelling
of
plaster
four
argand
lamps
were
hanging
parallel
to
each
other
and
shed
an
unpleasant
light
on
a
platform
at
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
desk
with
a
bell
underneath
it
a
table
representing
the
rostrum
and
on
each
side
two
others
somewhat
lower
for
the
secretaries
the
audience
that
adorned
the
benches
consisted
of
old
painters
of
daubs
ushers
and
literary
men
who
could
not
get
their
works
published
in
the
midst
of
those
lines
of
paletots
with
greasy
collars
could
be
seen
here
and
there
a
woman
cap
or
a
workman
linen
smock
the
bottom
of
the
apartment
was
even
full
of
workmen
who
had
in
all
likelihood
come
there
to
pass
away
an
idle
hour
and
who
had
been
introduced
by
some
speakers
in
order
that
they
might
applaud
frederick
took
care
to
place
himself
between
dussardier
and
regimbart
who
was
scarcely
seated
when
he
leaned
both
hands
on
his
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
shut
his
eyes
whilst
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
delmar
stood
looking
down
at
the
assembly
sénécal
appeared
at
the
president
desk
the
worthy
bookkeeper
thought
frederick
would
be
pleased
at
this
unexpected
discovery
it
only
annoyed
him
the
meeting
exhibited
great
respect
for
the
president
he
was
one
who
on
the
of
february
had
desired
an
immediate
organisation
of
labour
on
the
following
day
at
the
prado
he
had
declared
himself
in
favour
attacking
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
as
every
person
at
that
period
took
some
model
for
imitation
one
copied
another
danton
another
marat
as
for
him
he
tried
to
be
like
blanqui
who
imitated
robespierre
his
black
gloves
and
his
hair
brushed
back
gave
him
a
rigid
aspect
exceedingly
becoming
he
opened
the
proceedings
with
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
and
of
the
citizen
a
customary
act
of
faith
then
a
vigorous
voice
struck
up
béranger
souvenirs
du
peuple
other
voices
were
raised
no
no
not
that
casquette
the
patriots
at
the
bottom
of
the
apartment
began
to
howl
and
they
sang
in
chorus
the
favourite
lines
of
the
period
doff
your
hat
before
my
cap
kneel
before
the
at
a
word
from
the
president
the
audience
became
silent
one
of
the
secretaries
proceeded
to
inspect
the
letters
some
young
men
announced
that
they
burned
a
number
of
the
every
evening
in
front
of
the
panthéon
and
they
urged
on
all
patriots
to
follow
their
example
bravo
adopted
responded
the
audience
the
citizen
jean
jacques
langreneux
a
printer
in
the
rue
dauphin
would
like
to
have
a
monument
raised
to
the
memory
of
the
martyrs
of
thermidor
michel
evariste
népomucène
gave
expression
to
the
wish
that
the
european
democracy
should
adopt
unity
of
language
a
dead
language
might
be
used
for
that
purpose
as
for
example
improved
latin
no
no
latin
exclaimed
the
architect
why
said
the
and
these
two
gentlemen
engaged
in
a
discussion
in
which
the
others
also
took
part
each
putting
in
a
word
of
his
own
for
effect
and
the
conversation
on
this
topic
soon
became
so
tedious
that
many
went
away
but
a
little
old
man
who
wore
at
the
top
of
his
prodigiously
high
forehead
a
pair
of
green
spectacles
asked
permission
to
speak
in
order
to
make
an
important
communication
it
was
a
memorandum
on
the
assessment
of
taxes
the
figures
flowed
on
in
a
continuous
stream
as
if
they
were
never
going
to
end
the
impatience
of
the
audience
found
vent
at
first
in
murmurs
in
whispered
talk
he
allowed
nothing
to
put
him
out
then
they
began
hissing
they
catcalled
him
sénécal
called
the
persons
who
were
interrupting
to
order
the
orator
went
on
like
a
machine
it
was
necessary
to
catch
him
by
the
shoulder
in
order
to
stop
him
the
old
fellow
looked
as
if
he
were
waking
out
of
a
dream
and
placidly
lifting
his
spectacles
said
pardon
me
citizens
pardon
me
i
am
going
a
thousand
excuses
frederick
was
disconcerted
with
the
failure
of
the
old
man
attempts
to
read
this
written
statement
he
had
his
own
address
in
his
pocket
but
an
extemporaneous
speech
would
have
been
preferable
finally
the
president
announced
that
they
were
about
to
pass
on
to
the
important
matter
the
electoral
question
they
would
not
discuss
the
big
republican
lists
however
the
club
of
intellect
had
every
right
like
every
other
to
form
one
with
all
respect
for
the
pachas
of
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
the
citizens
who
solicited
the
popular
mandate
might
set
forth
their
claims
go
on
now
said
dussardier
a
man
in
a
cassock
with
woolly
hair
and
a
petulant
expression
on
his
face
had
already
raised
his
hand
he
said
with
a
stutter
that
his
name
was
ducretot
priest
and
agriculturist
and
that
he
was
the
author
of
a
work
entitled
manures
he
was
told
to
send
it
to
a
horticultural
club
then
a
patriot
in
a
blouse
climbed
up
into
the
rostrum
he
was
a
plebeian
with
broad
shoulders
a
big
face
very
with
long
black
hair
he
cast
on
the
assembly
an
almost
voluptuous
glance
flung
back
his
head
and
finally
spreading
out
his
arms
you
have
repelled
ducretot
o
my
brothers
and
you
have
done
right
but
it
was
not
through
irreligion
for
we
are
all
religious
many
of
those
present
listened
with
the
air
of
catechumens
and
in
ecstatic
attitudes
it
is
not
either
because
he
is
a
priest
for
we
too
are
priests
the
workman
is
a
priest
just
as
the
founder
of
socialism
was
the
master
of
us
all
jesus
christ
the
time
had
arrived
to
inaugurate
the
kingdom
of
god
the
gospel
led
directly
to
after
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
abolition
of
the
proletariat
they
had
had
the
age
of
hate
the
age
of
love
was
about
to
begin
christianity
is
the
keystone
and
the
foundation
of
the
new
edifice
you
are
making
game
of
us
exclaimed
the
traveller
in
wines
who
has
given
me
such
a
priest
cap
this
interruption
gave
great
offence
nearly
all
the
audience
got
on
benches
and
shaking
their
fists
shouted
atheist
aristocrat
low
rascal
whilst
the
president
bell
kept
ringing
continuously
and
the
cries
of
order
order
redoubled
but
aimless
and
moreover
fortified
by
three
cups
of
coffee
which
he
had
swallowed
before
coming
to
the
meeting
he
struggled
in
the
midst
of
the
others
what
i
an
aristocrat
come
now
when
at
length
he
was
permitted
to
give
an
explanation
he
declared
that
he
would
never
be
at
peace
with
the
priests
and
since
something
had
just
been
said
about
economical
measures
it
would
be
a
splendid
one
to
put
an
end
to
the
churches
the
sacred
pyxes
and
finally
all
creeds
somebody
raised
the
objection
that
he
was
going
very
far
yes
i
am
going
very
far
but
when
a
vessel
is
caught
suddenly
in
a
storm
without
waiting
for
the
conclusion
of
this
simile
another
made
a
reply
to
his
observation
granted
but
this
is
to
demolish
at
a
single
stroke
like
a
mason
devoid
of
judgment
you
are
insulting
the
masons
yelled
a
citizen
covered
with
plaster
and
persisting
in
the
belief
that
provocation
had
been
offered
to
him
he
vomited
forth
insults
and
wished
to
fight
clinging
tightly
to
the
bench
whereon
he
sat
it
took
no
less
than
three
men
to
put
him
out
meanwhile
the
workman
still
remained
on
the
rostrum
the
two
secretaries
gave
him
an
intimation
that
he
should
come
down
he
protested
against
the
injustice
done
to
him
you
shall
not
prevent
me
from
crying
out
love
to
our
dear
france
eternal
love
all
to
the
republic
citizens
said
compain
after
this
citizens
and
by
dint
of
repeating
citizens
having
obtained
a
little
silence
he
leaned
on
the
rostrum
with
his
two
red
hands
which
looked
like
stumps
bent
forward
his
body
and
blinking
his
eyes
i
believe
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
a
larger
extension
to
the
calf
head
all
who
heard
him
kept
silent
fancying
that
they
had
misunderstood
his
words
yes
the
calf
head
three
hundred
laughs
burst
forth
at
the
same
time
the
ceiling
shook
at
the
sight
of
all
these
faces
convulsed
with
mirth
compain
shrank
back
he
continued
in
an
angry
tone
what
you
do
know
what
the
calf
head
is
it
was
a
paroxysm
a
delirium
they
held
their
sides
some
of
them
even
tumbled
off
the
benches
to
the
ground
with
convulsions
of
laughter
compain
not
being
able
to
stand
it
any
longer
took
refuge
beside
regimbart
and
wanted
to
drag
him
away
no
i
am
remaining
till
is
all
over
said
the
citizen
this
reply
caused
frederick
to
make
up
his
mind
and
as
he
looked
about
to
the
right
and
the
left
to
see
whether
his
friends
were
prepared
to
support
him
he
saw
pellerin
on
the
rostrum
in
front
of
him
the
artist
assumed
a
haughty
tone
in
addressing
the
meeting
i
would
like
to
get
some
notion
as
to
who
is
the
candidate
amongst
all
these
that
represents
art
for
my
part
i
have
painted
a
picture
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
painting
pictures
was
the
churlish
remark
of
a
thin
man
with
red
spots
on
his
pellerin
protested
against
this
interruption
but
the
other
in
a
tragic
tone
ought
not
the
government
to
make
an
ordinance
abolishing
prostitution
and
want
and
this
phrase
having
at
once
won
to
his
side
the
popular
favour
he
thundered
against
the
corruption
of
great
cities
shame
and
infamy
we
ought
to
catch
hold
of
wealthy
citizens
on
their
way
out
of
the
maison
and
spit
in
their
faces
unless
it
be
that
the
government
countenances
debauchery
but
the
collectors
of
the
city
dues
exhibit
towards
our
daughters
and
our
sisters
an
amount
of
indecency
a
voice
exclaimed
some
distance
away
this
is
blackguard
language
turn
him
out
they
extract
taxes
from
us
to
pay
for
licentiousness
thus
the
high
salaries
paid
to
actors
help
cried
pellerin
he
leaped
from
the
rostrum
pushed
everybody
aside
and
declaring
that
he
regarded
such
stupid
accusations
with
disgust
expatiated
on
the
civilising
mission
of
the
player
inasmuch
as
the
theatre
was
the
focus
of
national
education
he
would
record
his
vote
for
the
reform
of
the
theatre
and
to
begin
with
no
more
managements
no
more
privileges
yes
of
any
sort
the
actor
performance
excited
the
audience
and
people
moved
backwards
and
forwards
knocking
each
other
down
no
more
academies
no
more
institutes
no
missions
no
more
bachelorships
down
with
university
degrees
let
us
preserve
them
said
sénécal
but
let
them
be
conferred
by
universal
suffrage
by
the
people
the
only
true
judge
besides
these
things
were
not
the
most
useful
it
was
necessary
to
take
a
level
which
would
be
above
the
heads
of
the
wealthy
and
he
represented
them
as
gorging
themselves
with
crimes
under
their
gilded
ceilings
while
the
poor
writhing
in
their
garrets
with
famine
cultivated
every
virtue
the
applause
became
so
vehement
that
he
interrupted
his
discourse
for
several
minutes
he
remained
with
his
eyes
closed
his
head
thrown
back
and
as
it
were
lulling
himself
to
sleep
over
the
fury
which
he
had
aroused
then
he
began
to
talk
in
a
dogmatic
fashion
in
phrases
as
imperious
as
laws
the
state
should
take
possession
of
the
banks
and
of
the
insurance
offices
inheritances
should
be
abolished
a
social
fund
should
be
established
for
the
workers
many
other
measures
were
desirable
in
the
future
for
the
time
being
these
would
suffice
and
returning
to
the
question
of
the
elections
we
want
pure
citizens
men
entirely
fresh
let
some
one
offer
himself
frederick
arose
there
was
a
buzz
of
approval
made
by
his
friends
but
sénécal
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
began
to
ask
questions
as
to
his
christian
name
and
surname
his
antecedents
life
and
morals
frederick
answered
succinctly
and
bit
his
lips
sénécal
asked
whether
anyone
saw
any
impediment
to
this
candidature
no
no
but
for
his
part
he
saw
some
all
around
him
bent
forward
and
strained
their
ears
to
listen
the
citizen
who
was
seeking
for
their
support
had
not
delivered
a
certain
sum
promised
by
him
for
the
foundation
of
a
democratic
journal
moreover
on
the
of
february
though
he
had
had
sufficient
notice
on
the
subject
he
had
failed
to
be
at
the
in
the
place

panthéon
i
swear
that
he
was
at
the
tuileries
exclaimed
dussardier
can
you
swear
to
having
seen
him
at
the
panthéon
dussardier
hung
down
his
head
frederick
was
silent
his
friends
scandalised
regarded
him
with
disquietude
in
any
case
sénécal
went
on

a
patriot
who
will

said
dussardier
oh
this
is
not
enough
another
frederick
turned
round
to
pellerin
the
artist
replied
to
him
with
a
great
number
of
gestures
which
meant
ah
my
dear
boy
they
have
rejected
myself
the
deuce
what
would
you
have
thereupon
frederick
gave
regimbart
a
nudge
yes

true

going
and
regimbart
stepped
upon
the
platform
then
pointing
towards
the
spaniard
who
had
followed
him
allow
me
citizens
to
present
to
you
a
patriot
from
barcelona
the
patriot
made
a
low
bow
rolled
his
gleaming
eyes
about
and
with
his
hand
on
his
heart

frederick
once
more
made
an
effort
to
obtain
a
hearing
but
citizens
the
spaniard
went
on

in

this
is

nobody

this
observation
exasperated
the
audience
turn

out
turn

out
who
i
asked
frederick
yourself
said
sénécal
majestically
out
with
you
he
rose
to
leave
and
the
voice
of
the
iberian
pursued
him

al
pueblo
frances
que
llamaria
yo
el
primero
pueblo
del
mundo
sino
fuese
ciudadano
de
otra
nación
aristo
screamed
one
blackguard
shaking
his
fist
at
frederick
as
the
latter
boiling
with
indignation
rushed
out
into
the
yard
adjoining
the
place
where
the
meeting
was
held
he
reproached
himself
for
his
devotedness
without
reflecting
that
after
all
the
accusations
brought
against
him
were
just
what
fatal
idea
was
this
candidature
but
what
asses
what
idiots
he
drew
comparisons
between
himself
and
these
men
and
soothed
his
wounded
pride
with
the
thought
of
their
stupidity
then
he
felt
the
need
of
seeing
rosanette
after
such
an
exhibition
of
ugly
traits
and
so
much
magniloquence
her
dainty
person
would
be
a
source
of
relaxation
she
was
aware
that
he
had
intended
to
present
himself
at
a
club
that
evening
however
she
did
not
even
ask
him
a
single
question
when
he
came
in
she
was
sitting
near
the
fire
ripping
open
the
lining
of
a
dress
he
was
surprised
to
find
her
thus
occupied
hallo
what
are
you
doing
you
can
see
for
yourself
said
she
dryly
i
am
mending
my
clothes
so
much
for
this
republic
of
yours
why
do
you
call
it
mine
perhaps
you
want
to
make
out
that
it
mine
and
she
began
to
upbraid
him
for
everything
that
had
happened
in
france
for
the
last
two
months
accusing
him
of
having
brought
about
the
revolution
and
with
having
ruined
her
prospects
by
making
everybody
that
had
money
leave
paris
and
that
she
would
be
dying
in
a
hospital
it
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
lightly
about
it
with
your
yearly
income
however
at
the
rate
at
which
things
are
going
on
you
wo
have
your
yearly
income
long
that
may
be
said
frederick
the
most
devoted
are
always
misunderstood
and
if
one
were
not
sustained
by
one
conscience
the
brutes
that
you
mix
yourself
up
with
would
make
you
feel
disgusted
with
your
own
rosanette
gazed
at
him
with
knitted
brows
eh
what
what
monsieur
has
not
succeeded
it
would
seem
so
much
the
better
it
will
teach
you
to
make
patriotic
donations
oh
do
lie
i
know
you
have
given
them
three
hundred
francs
for
this
republic
of
yours
has
to
be
kept
well
amuse
yourself
with
it
my
good
man
under
this
avalanche
of
abuse
frederick
passed
from
his
former
disappointment
to
a
more
painful
disillusion
he
withdrew
to
the
lower
end
of
the
apartment
she
came
up
to
him
look
here
think
it
out
a
bit
in
a
country
as
in
a
house
there
must
be
a
master
otherwise
everyone
pockets
something
out
of
the
money
spent
at
first
everybody
knows
that
is
head
over
ears
in
debt
as
for
lamartine
how
can
you
expect
a
poet
to
understand
politics
ah
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
shake
your
head
and
to
presume
that
you
have
more
brains
than
others
all
the
same
what
i
say
is
true
but
you
are
always
cavilling
a
person
ca
get
in
a
word
with
you
for
instance
there
who
had
stores
at
do
you
know
how
much
he
failed
for
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
and
gomer
the
packer
opposite
to
him
another
republican
that
one
he
smashed
the
tongs
on
his
wife
head
and
he
drank
so
much
absinthe
that
he
is
going
to
be
put
into
a
private
asylum
that
the
way
with
the
whole
of
them
the
republicans
a
republic
at
percent
ah
yes
plume
yourself
upon
it
frederick
took
himself
off
he
was
disgusted
at
the
foolishness
of
this
girl
which
revealed
itself
all
at
once
in
the
language
of
the
populace
he
felt
himself
even
becoming
a
little
patriotic
once
more
the
of
rosanette
only
increased
mademoiselle
vatnaz
irritated
him
with
her
enthusiasm
believing
that
she
had
a
mission
she
felt
a
furious
desire
to
make
speeches
to
carry
on
disputes
and
sharper
than
rosanette
in
matters
of
this
sort
overwhelmed
her
with
arguments
one
day
she
made
her
appearance
burning
with
indignation
against
hussonnet
who
had
just
indulged
in
some
blackguard
remarks
at
the
woman
club
rosanette
approved
of
this
conduct
declaring
even
that
she
would
take
men
clothes
to
go
and
give
them
a
bit
of
her
mind
the
entire
lot
of
them
and
to
whip
them
frederick
entered
at
the
same
moment
you
accompany
me
wo
you
and
in
spite
of
his
presence
a
bickering
match
took
place
between
them
one
of
them
playing
the
part
of
a
citizen
wife
and
the
other
of
a
female
philosopher
according
to
rosanette
women
were
born
exclusively
for
love
or
in
order
to
bring
up
children
to
be
housekeepers
according
to
mademoiselle
vatnaz
women
ought
to
have
a
position
in
the
government
in
former
times
the
gaulish
women
and
also
the
women
took
part
in
the
legislation
the
squaws
of
the
hurons
formed
a
portion
of
the
council
the
work
of
civilisation
was
common
to
both
it
was
necessary
that
all
should
contribute
towards
it
and
that
fraternity
should
be
substituted
for
egoism
association
for
individualism
and
cultivation
on
a
large
scale
for
minute
subdivision
of
land
come
that
is
good
you
know
a
great
deal
about
culture
just
now
why
not
besides
it
is
a
question
of
humanity
of
its
future
mind
your
own
business
this
is
my
business
they
got
into
a
passion
frederick
interposed
the
vatnaz
became
very
heated
and
went
so
far
as
to
uphold
communism
what
nonsense
said
rosanette
how
could
such
a
thing
ever
come
to
pass
the
other
brought
forward
in
support
of
her
theory
the
examples
of
the
essenes
the
moravian
brethren
the
jesuits
of
paraguay
the
family
of
the
pingons
near
thiers
in
auvergne
and
as
she
gesticulated
a
great
deal
her
gold
chain
got
entangled
in
her
bundle
of
trinkets
to
which
was
attached
a
gold
ornament
in
the
form
of
a
sheep
suddenly
rosanette
turned
exceedingly
pale
mademoiselle
vatnaz
continued
extricating
her
trinkets
do
give
yourself
so
much
trouble
said
rosanette
now
i
know
your
political
opinions
what
replied
the
vatnaz
with
a
blush
on
her
face
like
that
of
a
virgin
oh
oh
you
understand
me
frederick
did
not
understand
there
had
evidently
been
something
taking
place
between
them
of
a
more
important
and
intimate
character
than
socialism
and
even
though
it
should
be
so
said
the
vatnaz
in
reply
rising
up
unflinchingly
is
a
loan
my
dear
set
off
one
debt
against
the
other
faith
i
do
deny
my
own
debts
i
owe
some
thousands
of
francs
a
nice
sum
i
borrow
at
least
i
do
rob
anyone
mademoiselle
vatnaz
made
an
effort
to
laugh
oh
i
would
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
for
him
take
care
it
is
dry
enough
to
burn
the
spinster
held
out
her
right
hand
to
her
and
keeping
it
raised
in
front
of
her
but
there
are
friends
of
yours
who
find
it
convenient
for
them
andalusians
i
suppose
as
castanets
you
beggar
the
maréchale
made
her
a
low
bow
there
nobody
so
charming
mademoiselle
vatnaz
made
no
reply
beads
of
perspiration
appeared
on
her
temples
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
carpet
she
panted
for
breath
at
last
she
reached
the
door
and
slamming
it
vigorously
good
night
you
hear
from
me
much
i
care
said
rosanette
the
effort
of
had
shattered
her
nerves
she
sank
down
on
the
divan
shaking
all
over
stammering
forth
words
of
abuse
shedding
tears
was
it
this
threat
on
the
part
of
the
vatnaz
that
had
caused
so
much
agitation
in
her
mind
oh
no
what
did
she
care
indeed
about
that
one
it
was
the
golden
sheep
a
present
and
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
the
name
of
delmar
escaped
her
lips
so
then
she
was
in
love
with
the
mummer
in
that
case
why
did
she
take
on
with
me
frederick
asked
himself
how
is
it
that
he
has
come
back
again
who
compels
her
to
keep
me
where
is
the
sense
of
this
sort
of
thing
rosanette
was
still
sobbing
she
remained
all
the
time
stretched
at
the
edge
of
the
divan
with
her
right
cheek
resting
on
her
two
hands
and
she
seemed
a
being
so
dainty
so
free
from
and
so
sorely
troubled
that
he
drew
closer
to
her
and
softly
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
thereupon
she
gave
him
assurances
of
her
affection
for
him
the
prince
had
just
left
her
they
would
be
free
but
she
was
for
the
time
being
short
of
money
you
saw
yourself
that
this
was
so
the
other
day
when
i
was
trying
to
turn
my
old
linings
to
use
no
more
equipages
now
and
this
was
not
all
the
upholsterer
was
threatening
to
resume
possession
of
the
bedroom
and
the
large
furniture
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
frederick
had
a
mind
to
answer
do
annoy
yourself
about
it
i
will
pay
but
the
lady
knew
how
to
lie
experience
had
enlightened
her
he
confined
himself
to
mere
expressions
of
sympathy
rosanette
fears
were
not
vain
it
was
necessary
to
give
up
the
furniture
and
to
quit
the
handsome
apartment
in
the
rue
drouot
she
took
another
on
the
boulevard
poissonnière
on
the
fourth
floor
the
curiosities
of
her
old
boudoir
were
quite
sufficient
to
give
to
the
three
rooms
a
coquettish
air
there
were
chinese
blinds
a
tent
on
the
terrace
and
in
the
a
carpet
still
perfectly
new
with
ottomans
covered
with
pink
silk
frederick
had
contributed
largely
to
these
purchases
he
had
felt
the
joy
of
a
man
who
possesses
at
last
a
house
of
his
own
a
wife
of
his
own
and
being
much
pleased
with
the
place
he
used
to
sleep
there
nearly
every
evening
one
morning
as
he
was
passing
out
through
the
anteroom
he
saw
on
the
third
floor
on
the
staircase
the
shako
of
a
national
guard
who
was
ascending
it
where
in
the
world
was
he
going
frederick
waited
the
man
continued
his
progress
up
the
stairs
with
his
head
slightly
bent
down
he
raised
his
eyes
it
was
my
lord
arnoux
the
situation
was
clear
they
both
reddened
simultaneously
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
common
to
both
arnoux
was
the
first
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
she
is
better
is
that
so
as
if
rosanette
were
ill
and
he
had
come
to
learn
how
she
was
frederick
took
advantage
of
this
opening
yes
certainly
at
least
so
i
was
told
by
her
maid
wishing
to
convey
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
see
her
then
they
stood
facing
each
other
both
undecided
as
to
what
they
would
do
next
and
eyeing
one
another
intently
the
question
now
was
which
of
the
two
was
going
to
remain
arnoux
once
more
solved
the
problem
pshaw
i
come
back
where
are
you
going
i
go
with
you
and
when
they
were
in
the
street
he
chatted
as
naturally
as
usual
unquestionably
he
was
not
a
man
of
jealous
disposition
or
else
he
was
too
to
get
angry
besides
his
time
was
devoted
to
serving
his
country
he
never
left
off
his
uniform
now
on
the
of
march
he
had
defended
the
offices
of
the
when
the
chamber
was
invaded
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
courage
and
he
was
at
the
banquet
given
to
the
national
guard
at
amiens
hussonnet
who
was
still
on
duty
with
him
availed
himself
of
his
flask
and
his
cigars
but
irreverent
by
nature
he
delighted
in
contradicting
him
disparaging
the
somewhat
inaccurate
style
of
the
decrees
and
decrying
the
conferences
at
the
luxembourg
the
women
known
as
the
vésuviennes
the
political
section
bearing
the
name
of
tyroliens
everything
in
fact
down
to
the
car
of
agriculture
drawn
by
horses
to
the
and
escorted
by
young
girls
arnoux
on
the
other
hand
was
the
upholder
of
authority
and
dreamed
of
uniting
the
different
parties
however
his
own
affairs
had
taken
an
unfavourable
turn
and
he
was
more
or
less
anxious
about
them
he
was
not
much
troubled
about
frederick
relations
with
the
maréchale
for
this
discovery
made
him
feel
justified
in
his
conscience
in
withdrawing
the
allowance
which
he
had
renewed
since
the
prince
had
left
her
he
pleaded
by
way
of
excuse
for
this
step
the
embarrassed
condition
in
which
he
found
himself
uttered
many
lamentations
and
rosanette
was
generous
the
result
was
that
arnoux
regarded
himself
as
the
lover
who
appealed
entirely
to
the
heart
an
idea
that
raised
him
in
his
own
estimation
and
made
him
feel
young
again
having
no
doubt
that
frederick
was
paying
the
maréchale
he
fancied
that
he
was
playing
a
nice
trick
on
the
young
man
even
called
at
the
house
in
such
a
stealthy
fashion
as
to
keep
the
other
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
and
when
they
happened
to
meet
left
the
coast
clear
for
him
frederick
was
not
pleased
with
this
partnership
and
his
politeness
seemed
only
an
elaborate
piece
of
sarcasm
but
by
taking
offence
at
it
he
would
have
removed
from
his
path
every
opportunity
of
ever
finding
his
way
back
to
madame
arnoux
and
then
this
was
the
only
means
whereby
he
could
hear
about
her
movements
the
in
accordance
with
his
usual
practice
or
perhaps
with
some
cunning
design
recalled
her
readily
in
the
course
of
conversation
and
asked
him
why
he
no
longer
came
to
see
her
frederick
having
exhausted
every
excuse
he
could
frame
assured
him
that
he
had
called
several
times
to
see
madame
arnoux
but
without
success
arnoux
was
convinced
that
this
was
so
for
he
had
often
referred
in
an
eager
tone
at
home
to
the
absence
of
their
friend
and
she
had
invariably
replied
that
she
was
out
when
he
called
so
that
these
two
lies
in
place
of
contradicting
corroborated
each
other
the
young
man
gentle
ways
and
the
pleasure
of
finding
a
dupe
in
him
made
arnoux
like
him
all
the
better
he
carried
familiarity
to
its
extreme
limits
not
through
disdain
but
through
assurance
one
day
he
wrote
saying
that
very
urgent
business
compelled
him
to
be
away
in
the
country
for
hours
he
begged
of
the
young
man
to
mount
guard
in
his
stead
frederick
dared
not
refuse
so
he
repaired
to
the
in
the
place
du
carrousel
he
had
to
submit
to
the
society
of
the
national
guards
and
with
the
exception
of
a
a
witty
fellow
who
drank
to
an
inordinate
extent
they
all
appeared
to
him
more
stupid
than
their
the
principal
subject
of
conversation
amongst
them
was
the
substitution
of
sashes
for
belts
others
declaimed
against
the
national
workshops
one
man
said
where
are
we
going
the
man
to
whom
the
words
had
been
addressed
opened
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
standing
on
the
verge
of
an
abyss
where
are
we
going
then
one
who
was
more
daring
than
the
rest
exclaimed
it
can
not
last
it
must
come
to
an
end
and
as
the
same
kind
of
talk
went
on
till
night
frederick
was
bored
to
death
great
was
his
surprise
when
at
eleven
he
suddenly
beheld
arnoux
who
immediately
explained
that
he
had
hurried
back
to
set
him
at
liberty
having
disposed
of
his
own
business
the
fact
was
that
he
had
no
business
to
transact
the
whole
thing
was
an
invention
to
enable
him
to
spend
hours
alone
with
rosanette
but
the
worthy
arnoux
had
placed
too
much
confidence
in
his
own
powers
so
that
now
in
the
state
of
lassitude
which
was
the
result
he
was
seized
with
remorse
he
had
come
to
thank
frederick
and
to
invite
him
to
have
some
supper
a
thousand
thanks
i
not
hungry
all
i
want
is
to
go
to
bed
a
reason
the
more
for
having
a
snack
together
how
flabby
you
are
one
does
not
go
home
at
such
an
hour
as
this
it
is
too
late
it
would
be
dangerous
frederick
once
more
yielded
arnoux
was
quite
a
favorite
with
his
who
had
not
expected
to
see
him
and
he
was
a
particular
crony
of
the
refiner
they
were
all
fond
of
him
and
he
was
such
a
good
fellow
that
he
was
sorry
hussonnet
was
not
there
but
he
wanted
to
shut
his
eyes
for
one
minute
no
longer
sit
down
beside
me
said
he
to
frederick
stretching
himself
on
the
without
taking
off
his
belt
and
straps
through
fear
of
an
alarm
in
spite
of
the
regulation
he
even
kept
his
gun
in
his
hand
then
stammered
out
some
words
my
darling
my
little
angel
and
ere
long
was
fast
asleep
those
who
had
been
talking
to
each
other
became
silent
and
gradually
there
was
a
deep
silence
in
the
frederick
tormented
by
the
fleas
kept
staring
about
him
the
wall
painted
yellow
had
up
a
long
shelf
on
which
the
knapsacks
formed
a
succession
of
little
humps
while
underneath
the
muskets
which
had
the
colour
of
lead
rose
up
side
by
side
and
there
could
be
heard
a
succession
of
snores
produced
by
the
national
guards
whose
stomachs
were
outlined
through
the
darkness
in
a
confused
fashion
on
the
top
of
the
stove
stood
an
empty
bottle
and
some
plates
three
straw
chairs
were
drawn
around
the
table
on
which
a
pack
of
cards
was
displayed
a
drum
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
let
its
strap
hang
down
a
warm
breath
of
air
making
its
way
through
the
door
caused
the
lamp
to
smoke
arnoux
slept
with
his
two
arms
wide
apart
and
as
his
gun
was
placed
in
a
slightly
crooked
position
with
the
downward
the
mouth
of
the
barrel
came
up
right
under
his
arm
frederick
noticed
this
and
was
alarmed
but
no
i
wrong
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
yet
suppose
he
met
his
death
and
immediately
pictures
unrolled
themselves
before
his
mind
in
endless
succession
he
saw
himself
with
her
at
night
in
a
then
on
a
bank
on
a
summer
evening
and
under
the
reflection
of
a
lamp
at
home
in
their
own
house
he
even
fixed
his
attention
on
household
expenses
and
domestic
arrangements
contemplating
feeling
already
his
happiness
between
his
hands
and
in
order
to
realise
it
all
that
was
needed
was
that
the
cock
of
the
gun
should
rise
the
end
of
it
could
be
pushed
with
one
toe
the
gun
would
go
off
it
would
be
a
mere
accident
nothing
more
frederick
brooded
over
this
idea
like
a
playwright
in
the
agonies
of
composition
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
not
far
from
being
carried
into
practical
operation
and
that
he
was
going
to
contribute
to
that
result
that
in
fact
he
was
yearning
for
it
and
then
a
feeling
of
absolute
terror
took
possession
of
him
in
the
midst
of
this
mental
distress
he
experienced
a
sense
of
pleasure
and
he
allowed
himself
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
it
with
a
dreadful
consciousness
all
the
time
that
his
scruples
were
vanishing
in
the
wildness
of
his
reverie
the
rest
of
the
world
became
effaced
and
he
could
only
realise
that
he
was
still
alive
from
the
intolerable
oppression
on
his
chest
let
us
take
a
drop
of
white
wine
said
the
refiner
as
he
awoke
arnoux
sprang
to
his
feet
and
as
soon
as
the
white
wine
was
swallowed
he
wanted
to
relieve
frederick
of
his
sentry
duty
then
he
brought
him
to
have
breakfast
in
the
rue
de
chartres
at
parly
and
as
he
required
to
recuperate
his
energies
he
ordered
two
dishes
of
meat
a
lobster
an
omelet
with
rum
a
salad
and
finished
this
off
with
a
brand
of
sauterne
of
and
one
of
romanée
not
to
speak
of
the
champagne
at
dessert
and
the
liqueurs
frederick
did
not
in
any
way
gainsay
him
he
was
disturbed
in
mind
as
if
by
the
thought
that
the
other
might
somehow
trace
on
his
countenance
the
idea
that
had
lately
flitted
before
his
imagination
with
both
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
bent
forward
so
that
he
annoyed
frederick
by
his
fixed
stare
he
confided
some
of
his
hobbies
to
the
young
man
he
wanted
to
take
for
farming
purposes
all
the
embankments
on
the
northern
line
in
order
to
plant
potatoes
there
or
else
to
organise
on
the
boulevards
a
monster
cavalcade
in
which
the
celebrities
of
the
period
would
figure
he
would
let
all
the
windows
which
would
at
the
rate
of
three
francs
for
each
person
produce
a
handsome
profit
in
short
he
dreamed
of
a
great
stroke
of
fortune
by
means
of
a
monopoly
he
assumed
a
moral
tone
nevertheless
found
fault
with
excesses
and
all
sorts
of
misconduct
spoke
about
his
poor
father
and
every
evening
as
he
said
made
an
examination
of
his
conscience
before
offering
his
soul
to
god
a
little
curaçao
eh
just
as
you
please
as
for
the
republic
things
would
right
themselves
in
fact
he
looked
on
himself
as
the
happiest
man
on
earth
and
forgetting
himself
he
exalted
rosanette
attractive
qualities
and
even
compared
her
with
his
wife
it
was
quite
a
different
thing
you
could
not
imagine
a
lovelier
person
your
health
frederick
touched
glasses
with
him
he
had
out
of
complaisance
drunk
a
little
too
much
besides
the
strong
sunlight
dazzled
him
and
when
they
went
up
the
rue
vivienne
together
again
their
shoulders
touched
each
other
in
a
fraternal
fashion
when
he
got
home
frederick
slept
till
seven
after
that
he
called
on
the
maréchale
she
had
gone
out
with
somebody
with
arnoux
perhaps
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
he
continued
his
promenade
along
the
boulevard
but
could
not
get
past
the
porte
owing
to
the
great
crowd
that
blocked
the
way
want
had
abandoned
to
their
own
resources
a
considerable
number
of
workmen
and
they
used
to
come
there
every
evening
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
review
and
awaiting
a
signal
in
spite
of
the
law
against
riotous
assemblies
these
clubs
of
despair
increased
to
a
frightful
extent
and
many
citizens
repaired
every
day
to
the
spot
through
bravado
and
because
it
was
the
fashion
all
of
a
sudden
frederick
caught
a
glimpse
three
paces
away
of
dambreuse
along
with
martinon
he
turned
his
head
away
for
dambreuse
having
got
himself
nominated
as
a
representative
of
the
people
he
cherished
a
secret
spite
against
him
but
the
capitalist
stopped
him
one
word
my
dear
monsieur
i
have
some
explanations
to
make
to
you
i
am
not
asking
you
for
any
pray
listen
to
me
it
was
not
his
fault
in
any
way
appeals
had
been
made
to
him
pressure
had
to
a
certain
extent
been
placed
on
him
martinon
immediately
endorsed
all
that
he
had
said
some
of
the
electors
of
nogent
had
presented
themselves
in
a
deputation
at
his
house
besides
i
expected
to
be
free
as
soon
as
a
crush
of
people
on
the
footpath
forced
dambreuse
to
get
out
of
the
way
a
minute
after
he
reappeared
saying
to
martinon
this
is
a
genuine
service
really
and
you
wo
have
any
reason
to
regret
all
three
stood
with
their
backs
resting
against
a
shop
in
order
to
be
able
to
chat
more
at
their
ease
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
cry
of
long
live
napoléon
long
live
barbès
down
with
marie
the
countless
throng
kept
talking
in
very
loud
tones
and
all
these
voices
echoing
through
the
houses
made
so
to
speak
the
continuous
ripple
of
waves
in
a
harbour
at
intervals
they
ceased
and
then
could
be
heard
voices
singing
the
marseillaise
under
the
men
of
mysterious
aspect
offered
to
those
who
passed
sometimes
two
individuals
one
of
whom
preceded
the
other
would
wink
and
then
quickly
hurry
away
the
footpaths
were
filled
with
groups
of
staring
idlers
a
dense
crowd
swayed
to
and
fro
on
the
pavement
entire
bands
of
emerging
from
the
alleys
had
scarcely
made
their
way
into
the
midst
of
the
multitude
when
they
were
swallowed
up
in
the
mass
of
people
little
red
flags
here
and
there
looked
like
flames
coachmen
from
the
place
where
they
sat
high
up
gesticulated
energetically
and
then
turned
to
go
back
it
was
a
case
of
perpetual
movement
one
of
the
strangest
sights
that
could
be
conceived
how
all
this
said
martinon
would
have
amused
mademoiselle
cécile
my
wife
as
you
are
aware
does
not
like
my
niece
to
come
with
us
returned
dambreuse
with
a
smile
one
could
scarcely
recognise
in
him
the
same
man
for
the
past
three
months
he
had
been
crying
long
live
the
republic
and
he
had
even
voted
in
favour
of
the
banishment
of
orléans
but
there
should
be
an
end
of
concessions
he
exhibited
his
rage
so
far
as
to
carry
a
tomahawk
in
his
pocket
martinon
had
one
too
the
magistracy
not
being
any
longer
irremovable
he
had
withdrawn
from
parquet
so
that
he
surpassed
dambreuse
in
his
display
of
violence
the
banker
had
a
special
antipathy
to
lamartine
for
having
supported
and
at
the
same
time
to
pierre
leroux
proudhon
considérant
lamennais
and
all
the
cranks
all
the
socialists
for
in
fact
what
is
it
they
want
the
duty
on
meat
and
arrest
for
debt
have
been
abolished
now
the
project
of
a
bank
for
mortgages
is
under
consideration
the
other
day
it
was
a
national
bank
and
here
are
five
millions
in
the
budget
for
the
but
luckily
it
is
over
thanks
to
monsieur
de
falloux
to
them
let
them
go
in
fact
not
knowing
how
to
maintain
the
three
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
national
workshops
the
minister
of
public
works
had
that
very
day
signed
an
order
inviting
all
citizens
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
twenty
to
take
service
as
soldiers
or
else
to
start
for
the
provinces
to
cultivate
the
ground
there
they
were
indignant
at
the
alternative
thus
put
before
them
convinced
that
the
object
was
to
destroy
the
republic
they
were
aggrieved
by
the
thought
of
having
to
live
at
a
distance
from
the
capital
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
exile
they
saw
themselves
dying
of
fevers
in
desolate
parts
of
the
country
to
many
of
them
moreover
who
had
been
accustomed
to
work
of
a
refined
description
agriculture
seemed
a
degradation
it
was
in
short
a
mockery
a
decisive
breach
of
all
the
promises
which
had
been
made
to
them
if
they
offered
any
resistance
force
would
be
employed
against
them
they
had
no
doubt
of
it
and
made
preparations
to
anticipate
it
about
nine
the
riotous
assemblies
which
had
formed
at
the
bastille
and
at
the
châtelet
ebbed
back
towards
the
boulevard
from
the
porte
to
the
porte
nothing
could
be
seen
save
an
enormous
swarm
of
people
a
single
mass
of
a
dark
blue
shade
nearly
black
the
men
of
whom
one
caught
a
glimpse
all
had
glowing
eyes
pale
complexions
faces
emaciated
with
hunger
and
excited
with
a
sense
of
wrong
meanwhile
some
clouds
had
gathered
the
tempestuous
sky
roused
the
electricity
that
was
in
the
people
and
they
kept
whirling
about
of
their
own
accord
with
the
great
swaying
movements
of
a
swelling
sea
and
one
felt
that
there
was
an
incalculable
force
in
the
depths
of
this
excited
throng
and
as
it
were
the
energy
of
an
element
then
they
all
began
exclaiming
lamps
lamps
many
windows
had
no
illumination
and
stones
were
flung
at
the
panes
dambreuse
deemed
it
prudent
to
withdraw
from
the
scene
the
two
young
men
accompanied
him
home
he
predicted
great
disasters
the
people
might
once
more
invade
the
chamber
and
on
this
point
he
told
them
how
he
should
have
been
killed
on
the
fifteenth
of
may
had
it
not
been
for
the
devotion
of
a
national
guard
but
i
had
forgotten
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
your
friend
the
earthenware
manufacturer
jacques
arnoux
the
rioters
had
been
actually
throttling
him
when
that
brave
citizen
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
put
him
safely
out
of
their
reach
so
it
was
that
since
then
there
had
been
a
kind
of
intimacy
between
them
it
would
be
necessary
one
of
these
days
to
dine
together
and
since
you
often
see
him
give
him
the
assurance
that
i
like
him
very
much
he
is
an
excellent
man
and
has
in
my
opinion
been
slandered
and
he
has
his
wits
about
him
in
the
morning
my
compliments
once
more
a
very
good
evening
frederick
after
he
had
quitted
dambreuse
went
back
to
the
maréchale
and
in
a
very
gloomy
fashion
said
that
she
should
choose
between
him
and
arnoux
she
replied
that
she
did
not
understand
dumps
of
this
sort
that
she
did
not
care
about
arnoux
and
had
no
desire
to
cling
to
him
frederick
was
thirsting
to
fly
from
paris
she
did
not
offer
any
opposition
to
this
whim
and
next
morning
they
set
out
for
fontainebleau
the
hotel
at
which
they
stayed
could
be
distinguished
from
others
by
a
fountain
that
rippled
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
attached
to
it
the
doors
of
the
various
apartments
opened
out
on
a
corridor
as
in
monasteries
the
room
assigned
to
them
was
large
hung
with
print
and
noiseless
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
tourists
alongside
the
houses
people
who
had
nothing
to
do
kept
passing
up
and
down
then
under
their
windows
when
the
day
was
declining
children
in
the
street
would
engage
in
a
game
of
base
and
this
tranquillity
following
so
soon
the
tumult
they
had
witnessed
in
paris
filled
them
with
astonishment
and
exercised
over
them
a
soothing
influence
every
morning
at
an
early
hour
they
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
château
as
they
passed
in
through
the
gate
they
had
a
view
of
its
entire
front
with
the
five
pavilions
covered
with
roofs
and
its
staircase
of
opening
out
to
the
end
of
the
courtyard
which
is
hemmed
in
to
right
and
left
by
two
main
portions
of
the
building
further
down
on
the
paved
ground
lichens
blended
their
colours
here
and
there
with
the
tawny
hue
of
bricks
and
the
entire
appearance
of
the
palace
like
old
armour
had
about
it
something
of
the
impassiveness
of
royalty
a
sort
of
warlike
melancholy
grandeur
at
last
a
made
his
appearance
with
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
he
first
showed
them
the
apartments
of
the
queens
the
oratory
the
gallery
of
francis
the
mahogany
table
on
which
the
emperor
signed
his
abdication
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
cut
in
two
the
old
galerie
des
cerfs
the
place
where
christine
got
monaldeschi
assassinated
rosanette
listened
to
this
narrative
attentively
then
turning
towards
frederick
no
doubt
it
was
through
jealousy
mind
yourself
after
this
they
passed
through
the
council
chamber
the
guards
room
the
throne
room
and
the
of
louis
xiii
the
uncurtained
windows
sent
forth
a
white
light
the
handles
of
the
and
the
copper
feet
of
the
were
slightly
tarnished
with
dust
the
armchairs
were
everywhere
hidden
under
coarse
linen
covers
above
the
doors
could
be
seen
reliquaries
of
louis
and
here
and
there
hangings
representing
the
gods
of
olympus
psyche
or
the
battles
of
alexander
as
she
was
passing
in
front
of
the
mirrors
rosanette
stopped
for
a
moment
to
smooth
her
after
passing
through
the
and
the
chapel
they
reached
the
festal
hall
they
were
dazzled
by
the
magnificence
of
the
ceiling
which
was
divided
into
octagonal
apartments
set
off
with
gold
and
silver
more
finely
chiselled
than
a
jewel
and
by
the
vast
number
of
paintings
covering
the
walls
from
the
immense
where
the
arms
of
france
were
surrounded
by
crescents
and
quivers
down
to
the
musicians
gallery
which
had
been
erected
at
the
other
end
along
the
entire
width
of
the
hall
the
ten
arched
windows
were
wide
open
the
sun
threw
its
lustre
on
the
pictures
so
that
they
glowed
beneath
its
rays
the
blue
sky
continued
in
an
endless
curve
the
ultramarine
of
the
arches
and
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
where
the
lofty
summits
of
the
trees
filled
up
the
horizon
there
seemed
to
come
an
echo
of
flourishes
blown
by
ivory
trumpets
and
mythological
ballets
gathering
together
under
the
foliage
princesses
and
nobles
disguised
as
nymphs
or
fauns
an
epoch
of
ingenuous
science
of
violent
passions
and
sumptuous
art
when
the
ideal
was
to
sweep
away
the
world
in
a
vision
of
the
hesperides
and
when
the
mistresses
of
kings
mingled
their
glory
with
the
stars
there
was
a
portrait
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
celebrated
women
in
the
form
of
diana
the
huntress
and
even
the
infernal
diana
no
doubt
in
order
to
indicate
the
power
which
she
possessed
even
beyond
the
limits
of
the
tomb
all
these
symbols
confirmed
her
glory
and
there
remained
about
the
spot
something
of
her
an
indistinct
voice
a
radiation
that
stretched
out
indefinitely
a
feeling
of
mysterious
retrospective
voluptuousness
took
possession
of
frederick
in
order
to
divert
these
passionate
longings
into
another
channel
he
began
to
gaze
tenderly
on
rosanette
and
asked
her
would
she
not
like
to
have
been
this
woman
what
woman
diane
de
poitiers
he
repeated
diane
de
poitiers
the
mistress
of
henry
ii
she
gave
utterance
to
a
little
ah
that
was
all
her
silence
clearly
demonstrated
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
and
had
failed
to
comprehend
his
meaning
so
that
out
of
complaisance
he
said
to
her
perhaps
you
are
getting
tired
of
this
no
no
quite
the
reverse
and
lifting
up
her
chin
and
casting
around
her
a
glance
of
the
vaguest
description
rosanette
let
these
words
escape
her
lips
it
recalls
some
memories
to
me
meanwhile
it
was
easy
to
trace
on
her
countenance
a
strained
expression
a
certain
sense
of
awe
and
as
this
air
of
gravity
made
her
look
all
the
prettier
frederick
overlooked
it
the
carps
pond
amused
her
more
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
kept
flinging
pieces
of
bread
into
the
water
in
order
to
see
the
fishes
skipping
about
frederick
had
seated
himself
by
her
side
under
the
he
saw
in
imagination
all
the
personages
who
had
haunted
these
walls
charles
the
valois
kings
henry
peter
the
great
jean
jacques
rousseau
and
the
fair
mourners
of
the
voltaire
napoléon
pius
and
louis
philippe
and
he
felt
himself
environed
elbowed
by
these
tumultuous
dead
people
he
was
stunned
by
such
a
confusion
of
historic
figures
even
though
he
found
a
certain
fascination
in
contemplating
them
nevertheless
at
length
they
descended
into
the
it
is
a
vast
rectangle
which
presents
to
the
spectator
at
the
first
glance
its
wide
yellow
walks
its
square
its
ribbons
of
its
shaped
like
pyramids
its
green
swards
and
its
narrow
borders
in
which
flowers
make
spots
on
the
grey
soil
at
the
end
of
the
garden
may
be
seen
a
park
through
whose
entire
length
a
canal
makes
its
way
royal
residences
have
attached
to
them
a
peculiar
kind
of
melancholy
due
no
doubt
to
their
dimensions
being
much
too
large
for
the
limited
number
of
guests
entertained
within
them
to
the
silence
which
one
feels
astonished
to
find
in
them
after
so
many
flourishes
of
trumpets
to
the
immobility
of
their
luxurious
furniture
which
attests
by
the
aspect
of
age
and
decay
it
gradually
assumes
the
transitory
character
of
dynasties
the
eternal
wretchedness
of
all
things
and
this
exhalation
of
the
centuries
enervating
and
funereal
like
the
perfume
of
a
mummy
makes
itself
felt
even
in
untutored
brains
rosanette
yawned
immoderately
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
after
their
breakfast
an
open
carriage
came
round
for
them
they
started
from
fontainebleau
at
a
point
where
several
roads
diverged
then
went
up
at
a
walking
pace
a
gravelly
road
leading
towards
a
little
the
trees
became
larger
and
from
time
to
time
the
driver
would
say
this
is
the
frères
siamois
the
pharamond
the
bouquet
de
roi
not
forgetting
a
single
one
of
these
notable
sites
sometimes
even
drawing
up
to
enable
them
to
admire
the
scene
they
entered
the
forest
of
franchard
the
carriage
glided
over
the
grass
like
a
sledge
pigeons
which
they
could
not
see
began
cooing
suddenly
the
waiter
of
a
café
made
his
appearance
and
they
alighted
before
the
railing
of
a
garden
in
which
a
number
of
round
tables
were
placed
then
passing
on
the
left
by
the
walls
of
a
ruined
abbey
they
made
their
way
over
big
boulders
of
stone
and
soon
reached
the
lower
part
of
the
gorge
it
is
covered
on
one
side
with
sandstones
and
tangled
together
while
on
the
other
side
the
ground
almost
quite
bare
slopes
towards
the
hollow
of
the
valley
where
a
makes
a
pale
line
through
the
brown
heather
and
far
above
could
be
traced
a
flat
summit
with
a
behind
it
later
they
stepped
out
of
the
vehicle
once
more
in
order
to
climb
the
heights
of
aspremont
the
roads
form
zigzags
between
the
under
rocks
with
angular
faces
all
this
corner
of
the
forest
has
a
sort
of
look
a
rather
wild
and
solitary
aspect
one
thinks
of
hermits
in
connection
with
it
companions
of
huge
stags
with
fiery
crosses
between
their
horns
who
were
wont
to
welcome
with
paternal
smiles
the
good
kings
of
france
when
they
knelt
before
their
grottoes
the
warm
air
was
filled
with
a
resinous
odour
and
roots
of
trees
crossed
one
another
like
veins
close
to
the
soil
rosanette
slipped
over
them
grew
dejected
and
felt
inclined
to
shed
tears
but
at
the
very
top
she
became
joyous
once
more
on
finding
under
a
roof
made
of
branches
a
sort
of
tavern
where
carved
wood
was
sold
she
drank
a
bottle
of
lemonade
and
bought
a
and
without
one
glance
towards
the
landscape
which
disclosed
itself
from
the
plateau
she
entered
the
brigands
cave
with
a
waiter
carrying
a
torch
in
front
of
her
their
carriage
was
awaiting
them
in
the
bas
breau
a
painter
in
a
blue
blouse
was
working
at
the
foot
of
an
with
his
box
of
colours
on
his
knees
he
raised
his
head
and
watched
them
as
they
passed
in
the
middle
of
the
hill
of
chailly
the
sudden
breaking
of
a
cloud
caused
them
to
turn
up
the
hoods
of
their
cloaks
almost
immediately
the
rain
stopped
and
the
of
the
street
glistened
under
the
sun
when
they
were
the
town
some
travellers
who
had
recently
arrived
informed
them
that
a
terrible
battle
had
stained
paris
with
blood
rosanette
and
her
lover
were
not
surprised
then
everybody
left
the
hotel
became
quiet
the
gas
was
put
out
and
they
were
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
murmur
of
the
fountain
in
the
courtyard
on
the
following
day
they
went
to
see
the
wolf
gorge
the
pool
the
long
rock
and
the
g
two
days
later
they
began
again
at
random
just
as
their
coachman
thought
fit
to
drive
them
without
asking
where
they
were
and
often
even
neglecting
the
famous
sites
they
felt
so
comfortable
in
their
old
landau
low
as
a
sofa
and
covered
with
a
rug
made
of
a
striped
material
which
was
quite
faded
the
moats
filled
with
brushwood
stretched
out
under
their
eyes
with
a
gentle
continuous
movement
white
rays
passed
like
arrows
through
the
tall
ferns
sometimes
a
road
that
was
no
longer
used
presented
itself
before
them
in
a
straight
line
and
here
and
there
might
be
seen
a
feeble
growth
of
weeds
in
the
centre
between
four
a
crucifix
extended
its
four
arms
in
other
places
stakes
were
bending
down
like
dead
trees
and
little
curved
paths
which
were
lost
under
the
leaves
made
them
feel
a
longing
to
pursue
them
at
the
same
moment
the
horse
turned
round
they
entered
there
they
plunged
into
the
mire
further
down
moss
had
sprouted
out
at
the
sides
of
the
deep
ruts
g
the
overall
the
word
means
a
loose
wrapper
worn
by
ladies
in
the
sixteenth
translator
they
believed
that
they
were
far
away
from
all
other
people
quite
alone
but
suddenly
a
with
his
gun
or
a
band
of
women
in
rags
with
big
bundles
of
fagots
on
their
backs
would
hurry
past
them
when
the
carriage
stopped
there
was
a
universal
silence
the
only
sounds
that
reached
them
were
the
blowing
of
the
horse
in
the
shafts
with
the
faint
cry
of
a
bird
more
than
once
repeated
the
light
at
certain
points
illuminating
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
left
the
interior
in
deep
shadow
or
else
attenuated
in
the
foreground
by
a
sort
of
twilight
it
exhibited
in
the
background
violet
vapours
a
white
radiance
the
midday
sun
falling
directly
on
wide
tracts
of
greenery
made
splashes
of
light
over
them
hung
gleaming
drops
of
silver
from
the
ends
of
the
branches
streaked
the
grass
with
long
lines
of
emeralds
and
flung
gold
spots
on
the
beds
of
dead
leaves
when
they
let
their
heads
fall
back
they
could
distinguish
the
sky
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
some
of
them
which
were
enormously
high
looked
like
patriarchs
or
emperors
or
touching
one
another
at
their
extremities
formed
with
their
long
shafts
as
it
were
triumphal
arches
others
sprouting
forth
obliquely
from
below
seemed
like
falling
columns
this
heap
of
big
vertical
lines
gaped
open
then
enormous
green
billows
unrolled
themselves
in
unequal
embossments
as
far
as
the
surface
of
the
valleys
towards
which
advanced
the
brows
of
other
hills
looking
down
on
white
plains
which
ended
by
losing
themselves
in
an
undefined
pale
tinge
standing
side
by
side
on
some
rising
ground
they
felt
as
they
drank
in
the
air
the
pride
of
a
life
more
free
penetrating
into
the
depths
of
their
souls
with
a
superabundance
of
energy
a
joy
which
they
could
not
explain
the
variety
of
trees
furnished
a
spectacle
of
the
most
diversified
character
the
beeches
with
their
smooth
white
bark
twisted
their
tops
together
ash
trees
softly
curved
their
bluish
branches
in
the
tufts
of
the
hornbeams
rose
up
holly
stiff
as
bronze
then
came
a
row
of
thin
birches
bent
into
elegiac
attitudes
and
the
symmetrical
as
organ
pipes
seemed
to
be
singing
a
song
as
they
swayed
to
and
fro
there
were
gigantic
oaks
with
knotted
forms
which
had
been
violently
shaken
stretched
themselves
out
from
the
soil
and
pressed
close
against
each
other
and
with
firm
trunks
resembling
torsos
launched
forth
to
heaven
despairing
appeals
with
their
bare
arms
and
furious
threats
like
a
group
of
titans
struck
motionless
in
the
midst
of
their
rage
an
atmosphere
of
gloom
a
feverish
languor
brooded
over
the
pools
whose
sheets
of
water
were
cut
into
flakes
by
the
overshadowing
the
lichens
on
their
banks
where
the
wolves
come
to
drink
are
of
the
colour
of
sulphur
burnt
as
it
were
by
the
footprints
of
witches
and
the
incessant
croaking
of
the
frogs
responds
to
the
cawing
of
the
crows
as
they
wheel
through
the
air
after
this
they
passed
through
the
monotonous
glades
planted
here
and
there
with
a
staddle
the
sound
of
iron
falling
with
a
succession
of
rapid
blows
could
be
heard
on
the
side
of
the
hill
a
group
of
quarrymen
were
breaking
the
rocks
these
rocks
became
more
and
more
numerous
and
finally
filled
up
the
entire
landscape
like
houses
flat
like
flagstones
propping
up
overhanging
and
became
intermingled
with
each
other
as
if
they
were
the
ruins
unrecognisable
and
monstrous
of
some
vanished
city
but
the
wild
chaos
they
exhibited
made
one
rather
dream
of
volcanoes
of
deluges
of
great
unknown
cataclysms
frederick
said
they
had
been
there
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
would
remain
so
till
the
end
rosanette
turned
aside
her
head
declaring
that
this
would
drive
her
out
of
her
mind
and
went
off
to
collect
sweet
heather
the
little
violet
blossoms
heaped
up
near
one
another
formed
unequal
plates
and
the
soil
which
was
giving
way
underneath
placed
soft
dark
fringes
on
the
sand
spangled
with
mica
one
day
they
reached
a
point
up
a
hill
where
the
soil
was
full
of
sand
its
surface
untrodden
till
now
was
streaked
so
as
to
resemble
symmetrical
waves
here
and
there
like
promontories
on
the
dry
bed
of
an
ocean
rose
up
rocks
with
the
vague
outlines
of
animals
tortoises
thrusting
forward
their
heads
crawling
seals
hippopotami
and
bears
not
a
soul
around
them
not
a
single
sound
the
shingle
glowed
under
the
dazzling
rays
of
the
sun
and
all
at
once
in
this
vibration
of
light
the
specimens
of
the
brute
creation
that
met
their
gaze
began
to
move
about
they
returned
home
quickly
flying
from
the
dizziness
that
had
seized
hold
of
them
almost
dismayed
the
gravity
of
the
forest
exercised
an
influence
over
them
and
hours
passed
in
silence
during
which
allowing
themselves
to
yield
to
the
lulling
effects
of
springs
they
remained
as
it
were
sunk
in
the
torpor
of
a
calm
intoxication
with
his
arm
around
her
waist
he
listened
to
her
talking
while
the
birds
were
warbling
noticed
with
the
same
glance
the
black
grapes
on
her
bonnet
and
the
the
draperies
of
her
veil
and
the
spiral
forms
assumed
by
the
clouds
and
when
he
bent
towards
her
the
freshness
of
her
skin
mingled
with
the
strong
perfume
of
the
woods
they
found
amusement
in
everything
they
showed
one
another
as
a
curiosity
gossamer
threads
of
the
virgin
hanging
from
bushes
holes
full
of
water
in
the
middle
of
stones
a
squirrel
on
the
branches
the
way
in
which
two
butterflies
kept
flying
after
them
or
else
at
twenty
paces
from
them
under
the
trees
a
hind
strode
on
peacefully
with
an
air
of
nobility
and
gentleness
its
doe
walking
by
its
side
rosanette
would
have
liked
to
run
after
it
to
embrace
it
she
got
very
much
alarmed
once
when
a
man
suddenly
presenting
himself
showed
her
three
vipers
in
a
box
she
wildly
flung
herself
on
frederick
breast
he
felt
happy
at
the
thought
that
she
was
weak
and
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
defend
her
that
evening
they
dined
at
an
inn
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
the
table
was
near
the
window
rosanette
sitting
opposite
him
and
he
contemplated
her
little
white
nose
her
lips
her
bright
eyes
the
swelling
bands
of
her
hair
and
her
pretty
oval
face
her
dress
of
raw
silk
clung
to
her
somewhat
drooping
shoulders
and
her
two
hands
emerging
from
their
sleeves
joined
close
together
as
if
they
were
one
carved
poured
out
wine
moved
over
the
the
waiters
placed
before
them
a
chicken
with
its
four
limbs
stretched
out
a
stew
of
eels
in
a
dish
of
wine
that
had
got
spoiled
bread
that
was
too
hard
and
knives
with
notches
in
them
all
these
things
made
the
repast
more
enjoyable
and
strengthened
the
illusion
they
fancied
that
they
were
in
the
middle
of
a
journey
in
italy
on
their
honeymoon
before
starting
again
they
went
for
a
walk
along
the
bank
of
the
river
the
soft
blue
sky
rounded
like
a
dome
leaned
at
the
horizon
on
the
indentations
of
the
woods
on
the
opposite
side
at
the
end
of
the
meadow
there
was
a
village
steeple
and
further
away
to
the
left
the
roof
of
a
house
made
a
red
spot
on
the
river
which
wound
its
way
without
any
apparent
motion
some
rushes
bent
over
it
however
and
the
water
lightly
shook
some
poles
fixed
at
its
edge
in
order
to
hold
nets
an
osier
and
two
or
three
old
might
be
seen
there
near
the
inn
a
girl
in
a
straw
hat
was
drawing
buckets
out
of
a
well
every
time
they
came
up
again
frederick
heard
the
grating
sound
of
the
chain
with
a
feeling
of
inexpressible
delight
he
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
happy
till
the
end
of
his
days
so
natural
did
his
felicity
appear
to
him
so
much
a
part
of
his
life
and
so
intimately
associated
with
this
woman
being
he
was
irresistibly
impelled
to
address
her
with
words
of
endearment
she
answered
with
pretty
little
speeches
light
taps
on
the
shoulder
displays
of
tenderness
that
charmed
him
by
their
unexpectedness
he
discovered
in
her
quite
a
new
sort
of
beauty
in
fact
which
was
perhaps
only
the
reflection
of
surrounding
things
unless
it
happened
to
bud
forth
from
their
hidden
potentialities
when
they
were
lying
down
in
the
middle
of
the
field
he
would
stretch
himself
out
with
his
head
on
her
lap
under
the
shelter
of
her
parasol
or
else
with
their
faces
turned
towards
the
green
sward
in
the
centre
of
which
they
rested
they
kept
gazing
towards
one
another
so
that
their
pupils
seemed
to
intermingle
thirsting
for
one
another
and
ever
satiating
their
thirst
and
then
with
eyelids
they
lay
side
by
side
without
uttering
a
single
word
now
and
then
the
distant
rolling
of
a
drum
reached
their
ears
it
was
the
which
was
being
beaten
in
the
different
villages
calling
on
people
to
go
and
defend
paris
oh
look
here
is
the
rising
said
frederick
with
a
disdainful
pity
all
this
excitement
now
presenting
to
his
mind
a
pitiful
aspect
by
the
side
of
their
love
and
of
eternal
nature
and
they
talked
about
whatever
happened
to
come
into
their
heads
things
that
were
perfectly
familiar
to
them
persons
in
whom
they
took
no
interest
a
thousand
trifles
she
chatted
with
him
about
her
chambermaid
and
her
hairdresser
one
day
she
was
so
that
she
told
him
her
age
years
she
was
becoming
quite
an
old
woman
several
times
without
intending
it
she
gave
him
some
particulars
with
reference
to
her
own
life
she
had
been
a
shop
girl
had
taken
a
trip
to
england
and
had
begun
studying
for
the
stage
all
this
she
told
without
any
explanation
of
how
these
changes
had
come
about
and
he
found
it
impossible
to
reconstruct
her
entire
history
she
related
to
him
more
about
herself
one
day
when
they
were
seated
side
by
side
under
a
at
the
back
of
a
meadow
at
the
further
down
a
little
barefooted
girl
standing
amid
a
heap
of
dust
was
making
a
cow
go
to
pasture
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
them
she
came
up
to
beg
and
while
with
one
hand
she
held
up
her
tattered
petticoat
she
kept
scratching
with
the
other
her
black
hair
which
like
a
wig
of
louis
xiv
time
curled
round
her
dark
face
lighted
by
a
magnificent
pair
of
eyes
she
will
be
very
pretty
said
frederick
how
lucky
she
is
if
she
has
no
mother
remarked
rosanette
eh
how
is
that
certainly
i
if
it
were
not
for
mine
she
sighed
and
began
to
speak
about
her
childhood
her
parents
were
weavers
in
the
she
acted
as
an
apprentice
to
her
father
in
vain
did
the
poor
man
wear
himself
out
with
hard
work
his
wife
was
continually
abusing
him
and
sold
everything
for
drink
rosanette
could
see
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
room
they
occupied
with
the
looms
ranged
lengthwise
against
the
windows
the
pot
boiling
on
the
stove
the
bed
painted
like
mahogany
a
cupboard
facing
it
and
the
obscure
loft
where
she
used
to
sleep
up
to
the
time
when
she
was
fifteen
years
old
at
length
a
gentleman
made
his
appearance
on
the
scene
a
fat
man
with
a
face
of
the
colour
of
boxwood
the
manners
of
a
devotee
and
a
suit
of
black
clothes
her
mother
and
this
man
had
a
conversation
together
with
the
result
that
three
days
afterwards
rosanette
stopped
and
with
a
look
in
which
there
was
as
much
bitterness
as
shamelessness
it
was
done
then
in
response
to
a
gesture
of
frederick
as
he
was
married
he
would
have
been
afraid
of
compromising
himself
in
his
own
house
i
was
brought
to
a
private
room
in
a
restaurant
and
told
that
i
would
be
happy
that
i
would
get
a
handsome
present
at
the
door
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
a
candelabrum
of
vermilion
on
a
table
on
which
there
were
two
covers
a
mirror
on
the
ceiling
showed
their
reflections
and
the
blue
silk
hangings
on
the
walls
made
the
entire
apartment
resemble
an
alcove
i
was
seized
with
astonishment
you
understand
a
poor
creature
who
had
never
seen
anything
before
in
spite
of
my
dazed
condition
of
mind
i
got
frightened
i
wanted
to
go
away
however
i
remained
the
only
seat
in
the
room
was
a
sofa
close
beside
the
table
it
was
so
soft
that
it
gave
way
under
me
the
mouth
of
the
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
sent
out
towards
me
a
warm
breath
and
there
i
sat
without
taking
anything
the
waiter
who
was
standing
near
me
urged
me
to
eat
he
poured
out
for
me
immediately
a
large
glass
of
wine
my
head
began
to
swim
i
wanted
to
open
the
window
he
said
to
me
mademoiselle
that
is
forbidden
and
he
left
me
the
table
was
covered
with
a
heap
of
things
that
i
had
no
knowledge
of
nothing
there
seemed
to
me
good
then
i
fell
back
on
a
pot
of
jam
and
patiently
waited
i
did
not
know
what
prevented
him
from
coming
it
was
very
late
midnight
at
last
i
could
bear
the
fatigue
any
longer
while
pushing
aside
one
of
the
pillows
in
order
to
hear
better
i
found
under
my
hand
a
kind
of
album
a
book
of
engravings
they
were
vulgar
pictures
i
was
sleeping
on
top
of
it
when
he
entered
the
room
she
hung
down
her
head
and
remained
pensive
the
leaves
rustled
around
them
amid
the
tangled
grass
a
great
foxglove
was
swaying
to
and
fro
the
sunlight
flowed
like
a
wave
over
the
green
expanse
and
the
silence
was
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
browsing
of
the
cow
which
they
could
no
longer
see
rosanette
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
particular
spot
three
paces
away
from
her
her
nostrils
heaving
and
her
mind
absorbed
in
thought
frederick
caught
hold
of
her
hand
how
you
suffered
poor
darling
yes
said
she
more
than
you
imagine
so
much
so
that
i
wanted
to
make
an
end
of
it
they
had
to
fish
me
up
what
ah
think
no
more
about
it
i
love
you
i
am
happy
kiss
me
and
she
picked
off
one
by
one
the
sprigs
of
the
thistles
which
clung
to
the
hem
of
her
gown
frederick
was
thinking
more
than
all
on
what
she
had
not
told
him
what
were
the
means
by
which
she
had
gradually
emerged
from
wretchedness
to
what
lover
did
she
owe
her
education
what
had
occurred
in
her
life
down
to
the
day
when
he
first
came
to
her
house
her
latest
avowal
was
a
bar
to
these
questions
all
he
asked
her
was
how
she
had
made
acquaintance
through
the
vatnaz
was
it
you
that
i
once
saw
with
both
of
them
at
the
he
referred
to
the
exact
date
rosanette
made
a
movement
which
showed
a
sense
of
deep
pain
yes
it
is
true
i
was
not
gay
at
that
time
but
arnoux
had
proved
himself
a
very
good
fellow
frederick
had
no
doubt
of
it
however
their
friend
was
a
queer
character
full
of
faults
he
took
care
to
recall
them
she
quite
agreed
with
him
on
this
point
never
mind
one
likes
him
all
the
same
this
camel
still
even
now
said
frederick
she
began
to
redden
half
smiling
half
angry
oh
no
that
an
old
story
i
do
keep
anything
hidden
from
you
even
though
it
might
be
so
with
him
it
is
different
besides
i
think
you
are
nice
towards
your
victim
my
victim
rosanette
caught
hold
of
his
chin
no
doubt
and
in
the
lisping
fashion
in
which
nurses
talk
to
babies
have
always
been
so
good
never
went
with
his
wife
i
never
at
any
time
rosanette
smiled
he
felt
hurt
by
this
smile
of
hers
which
seemed
to
him
a
proof
of
indifference
but
she
went
on
gently
and
with
one
of
those
looks
which
seem
to
appeal
for
a
denial
of
the
truth
are
you
perfectly
certain
not
a
doubt
of
it
frederick
solemnly
declared
on
his
word
of
honour
that
he
had
never
bestowed
a
thought
on
madame
arnoux
as
he
was
too
much
in
love
with
another
woman
why
with
you
my
beautiful
one
ah
do
laugh
at
me
you
only
annoy
me
he
thought
it
a
prudent
course
to
invent
a
story
to
pretend
that
he
was
swayed
by
a
passion
he
manufactured
some
circumstantial
details
this
woman
however
had
rendered
him
very
unhappy
decidedly
you
have
not
been
lucky
said
rosanette
oh
oh
i
may
have
been
wishing
to
convey
in
this
way
that
he
had
been
often
fortunate
in
his
so
that
she
might
have
a
better
opinion
of
him
just
as
rosanette
did
not
avow
how
many
lovers
she
had
had
in
order
that
he
might
have
more
respect
for
her
for
there
will
always
be
found
in
the
midst
of
the
most
intimate
confidences
restrictions
false
shame
delicacy
and
pity
you
divine
either
in
the
other
or
in
yourself
precipices
or
miry
paths
which
prevent
you
from
penetrating
any
farther
moreover
you
feel
that
you
will
not
be
understood
it
is
hard
to
express
accurately
the
thing
you
mean
whatever
it
may
be
and
this
is
the
reason
why
perfect
unions
are
rare
the
poor
maréchale
had
never
known
one
better
than
this
often
when
she
gazed
at
frederick
tears
came
into
her
eyes
then
she
would
raise
them
or
cast
a
glance
towards
the
horizon
as
if
she
saw
there
some
bright
dawn
perspectives
of
boundless
felicity
at
last
she
confessed
one
day
to
him
that
she
wished
to
have
a
mass
said
so
that
it
might
bring
a
blessing
on
our
love
how
was
it
then
that
she
had
resisted
him
so
long
she
could
not
tell
herself
he
repeated
his
question
a
great
many
times
and
she
replied
as
she
clasped
him
in
her
arms
it
was
because
i
was
afraid
my
darling
of
loving
you
too
well
on
sunday
morning
frederick
read
amongst
the
list
of
the
wounded
given
in
a
newspaper
the
name
of
dussardier
he
uttered
a
cry
and
showing
the
paper
to
rosanette
declared
that
he
was
going
to
start
at
once
for
paris
for
what
purpose
in
order
to
see
him
to
nurse
him
you
are
not
going
i
sure
to
leave
me
by
myself
come
with
me
ha
to
poke
my
nose
in
a
squabble
of
that
sort
oh
no
thanks
however
i
can
not
ta
ta
ta
as
if
they
had
need
of
nurses
in
the
hospitals
and
then
what
concern
is
he
of
yours
any
longer
everyone
for
himself
he
was
roused
to
indignation
by
this
egoism
on
her
part
and
he
reproached
himself
for
not
being
in
the
capital
with
the
others
such
indifference
to
the
misfortunes
of
the
nation
had
in
it
something
shabby
and
only
worthy
of
a
small
shopkeeper
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
his
intrigue
with
rosanette
weighed
on
his
mind
as
if
it
were
a
crime
for
an
hour
they
were
quite
cool
towards
each
other
then
she
appealed
to
him
to
wait
and
not
expose
himself
to
danger
suppose
you
happen
to
be
killed
well
i
should
only
have
done
my
duty
rosanette
gave
a
jump
his
first
duty
was
to
love
her
but
no
doubt
he
did
not
care
about
her
any
longer
there
was
no
common
sense
in
what
he
was
going
to
do
good
heavens
what
an
idea
frederick
rang
for
his
bill
but
to
get
back
to
pans
was
not
an
easy
matter
the
leloir
stagecoach
had
just
left
the
lecomte
berlins
would
not
be
starting
the
diligence
from
bourbonnais
would
not
be
passing
till
a
late
hour
that
night
and
perhaps
it
might
be
full
one
could
never
tell
when
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
in
making
enquiries
about
the
various
modes
of
conveyance
the
idea
occurred
to
him
to
travel
post
the
master
of
the
refused
to
supply
him
with
horses
as
frederick
had
no
passport
finally
he
hired
an
open
carriage
the
same
one
in
which
they
had
driven
about
the
country
and
at
about
five
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
hôtel
du
commerce
at
melun
the
was
covered
with
piles
of
arms
the
prefect
had
forbidden
the
national
guards
to
proceed
towards
paris
those
who
did
not
belong
to
his
department
wished
to
go
on
there
was
a
great
deal
of
shouting
and
the
inn
was
packed
with
a
noisy
crowd
rosanette
seized
with
terror
said
she
would
not
go
a
step
further
and
once
more
begged
of
him
to
stay
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
joined
in
her
entreaties
a
decent
sort
of
man
who
happened
to
be
dining
there
interposed
and
observed
that
the
fighting
would
be
over
in
a
very
short
time
besides
one
ought
to
do
his
duty
thereupon
the
maréchale
redoubled
her
sobs
frederick
got
exasperated
he
handed
her
his
purse
kissed
her
quickly
and
disappeared
on
reaching
corbeil
he
learned
at
the
station
that
the
insurgents
had
cut
the
rails
at
regular
distances
and
the
coachman
refused
to
drive
him
any
farther
he
said
that
his
horses
were
overspent
through
his
influence
however
frederick
managed
to
procure
an
indifferent
cabriolet
which
for
the
sum
of
sixty
francs
without
taking
into
account
the
price
of
a
drink
for
the
driver
was
to
convey
him
as
far
as
the
italian
barrier
but
at
a
hundred
paces
from
the
barrier
his
coachman
made
him
descend
and
turn
back
frederick
was
walking
along
the
pathway
when
suddenly
a
sentinel
thrust
out
his
bayonet
four
men
seized
him
exclaiming
this
is
one
of
them
look
out
search
him
brigand
scoundrel
and
he
was
so
thoroughly
stupefied
that
he
let
himself
be
dragged
to
the
of
the
barrier
at
the
very
point
where
the
boulevards
des
gobelins
and
de
and
rues
godefroy
and
mauffetard
converge
four
barricades
formed
at
the
ends
of
four
different
ways
enormous
sloping
ramparts
of
torches
were
glimmering
here
and
there
in
spite
of
the
rising
clouds
of
dust
he
could
distinguish
of
the
line
and
national
guards
all
with
their
faces
blackened
their
chests
uncovered
and
an
aspect
of
wild
excitement
they
had
just
captured
the
square
and
had
shot
down
a
number
of
men
their
rage
had
not
yet
cooled
frederick
said
he
had
come
from
fontainebleau
to
the
relief
of
a
wounded
comrade
who
lodged
in
the
rue
bellefond
not
one
of
them
would
believe
him
at
first
they
examined
his
hands
they
even
put
their
noses
to
his
ear
to
make
sure
that
he
did
not
smell
of
powder
however
by
dint
of
repeating
the
same
thing
he
finally
satisfied
a
captain
who
directed
two
fusiliers
to
conduct
him
to
the
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
they
descended
the
boulevard
de
a
strong
breeze
was
blowing
it
restored
him
to
animation
after
this
they
turned
up
the
rue
du
marché
aux
chevaux
the
jardin
des
plantes
at
the
right
formed
a
long
black
mass
whilst
at
the
left
the
entire
front
of
the
pitié
illuminated
at
every
window
blazed
like
a
conflagration
and
shadows
passed
rapidly
over
the
the
two
men
in
charge
of
frederick
went
away
another
accompanied
him
to
the
polytechnic
school
the
rue
was
quite
dark
without
a
or
a
light
at
any
window
to
relieve
the
gloom
every
ten
minutes
could
be
heard
the
words
sentinels
mind
yourselves
and
this
exclamation
cast
into
the
midst
of
the
silence
was
prolonged
like
the
repeated
striking
of
a
stone
against
the
side
of
a
chasm
as
it
falls
through
space
every
now
and
then
the
stamp
of
heavy
footsteps
could
be
heard
drawing
nearer
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
patrol
consisting
of
about
a
hundred
men
from
this
confused
mass
escaped
whisperings
and
the
dull
clanking
of
iron
and
moving
away
with
a
rhythmic
swing
it
melted
into
the
darkness
in
the
middle
of
the
crossing
where
several
streets
met
a
dragoon
sat
motionless
on
his
horse
from
time
to
time
an
express
rider
passed
at
a
rapid
gallop
then
the
silence
was
renewed
cannons
which
were
being
drawn
along
the
streets
made
on
the
pavement
a
heavy
rolling
sound
that
seemed
full
of
menace
a
sound
different
from
every
ordinary
sound
which
oppressed
the
heart
the
sounds
was
profound
unlimited
a
black
silence
men
in
white
blouses
accosted
the
soldiers
spoke
one
or
two
words
to
them
and
then
vanished
like
phantoms
the
of
the
polytechnic
school
overflowed
with
people
the
threshold
was
blocked
up
with
women
who
had
come
to
see
their
sons
or
their
husbands
they
were
sent
on
to
the
panthéon
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
and
no
attention
was
paid
to
frederick
he
pressed
forward
resolutely
solemnly
declaring
that
his
friend
dussardier
was
waiting
for
him
that
he
was
at
death
door
at
last
they
sent
a
corporal
to
accompany
him
to
the
top
of
the
rue
to
the
mayor
office
in
the
twelfth
arrondissement
the
place
du
panthéon
was
filled
with
soldiers
lying
asleep
on
straw
the
day
was
breaking
the
were
extinguished
the
insurrection
had
left
terrible
traces
in
this
quarter
the
soil
of
the
streets
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
covered
with
risings
of
various
sizes
on
the
wrecked
barricades
had
been
piled
up
omnibuses
and
in
certain
places
there
were
little
dark
pools
which
must
have
been
blood
the
houses
were
riddled
with
projectiles
and
their
framework
could
be
seen
under
the
plaster
that
was
peeled
off
each
attached
only
by
a
single
nail
hung
like
rags
the
staircases
having
fallen
in
doors
opened
on
vacancy
the
interiors
of
rooms
could
be
perceived
with
their
papers
in
strips
in
some
instances
dainty
objects
had
remained
in
them
quite
intact
frederick
noticed
a
timepiece
a
and
some
engravings
when
he
entered
the
mayor
office
the
national
guards
were
chattering
without
a
moment
pause
about
the
deaths
of
bréa
and
négrier
about
the
deputy
charbonnel
and
about
the
archbishop
of
paris
he
heard
them
saying
that
the
duc
had
landed
at
boulogne
that
barbès
had
fled
from
vincennes
that
the
artillery
were
coming
up
from
bourges
and
that
abundant
aid
was
arriving
from
the
provinces
about
three
some
one
brought
good
news
from
the
insurgents
were
in
conference
with
the
president
of
the
assembly
thereupon
they
all
made
merry
and
as
he
had
a
dozen
francs
left
frederick
sent
for
a
dozen
bottles
of
wine
hoping
by
this
means
to
hasten
his
deliverance
suddenly
a
discharge
of
musketry
was
heard
the
drinking
stopped
they
peered
with
distrustful
eyes
into
the
unknown
it
might
be
henry
in
order
to
get
rid
of
responsibility
they
took
frederick
to
the
mayor
office
in
the
eleventh
arrondissement
which
he
was
not
permitted
to
leave
till
nine
in
the
morning
he
started
at
a
running
pace
from
the
quai
voltaire
at
an
open
window
an
old
man
in
his
was
crying
with
his
eyes
raised
the
seine
glided
peacefully
along
the
sky
was
of
a
clear
blue
and
in
the
trees
round
the
tuileries
birds
were
singing
frederick
was
just
crossing
the
place
du
carrousel
when
a
litter
happened
to
be
passing
by
the
soldiers
at
the
immediately
presented
arms
and
the
officer
putting
his
hand
to
his
shako
said
honour
to
unfortunate
bravery
this
phrase
seemed
to
have
almost
become
a
matter
of
duty
he
who
pronounced
it
appeared
to
be
on
each
occasion
filled
with
profound
emotion
a
group
of
people
in
a
state
of
fierce
excitement
followed
the
litter
exclaiming
we
will
avenge
you
we
will
avenge
you
the
vehicles
kept
moving
about
on
the
boulevard
and
women
were
making
lint
before
the
doors
meanwhile
the
outbreak
had
been
quelled
or
very
nearly
so
a
proclamation
from
cavaignac
just
posted
up
announced
the
fact
at
the
top
of
the
rue
vivienne
a
company
of
the
garde
mobile
appeared
then
the
citizens
uttered
cries
of
enthusiasm
they
raised
their
hats
applauded
danced
wished
to
embrace
them
and
to
invite
them
to
drink
and
flowers
flung
by
ladies
fell
from
the
balconies
at
last
at
ten
at
the
moment
when
the
cannon
was
booming
as
an
attack
was
being
made
on
the
faubourg
frederick
reached
the
abode
of
dussardier
he
found
the
bookkeeper
in
his
garret
lying
asleep
on
his
back
from
the
adjoining
apartment
a
woman
came
forth
with
silent
tread
mademoiselle
vatnaz
she
led
frederick
aside
and
explained
to
him
how
dussardier
had
got
wounded
on
saturday
on
the
top
of
a
barricade
in
the
rue
lafayette
a
young
fellow
wrapped
in
a
tricoloured
flag
cried
out
to
the
national
guards
are
you
going
to
shoot
your
brothers
as
they
advanced
dussardier
threw
down
his
gun
pushed
away
the
others
sprang
over
the
barricade
and
with
a
blow
of
an
old
shoe
knocked
down
the
insurgent
from
whom
he
tore
the
flag
he
had
afterwards
been
found
under
a
heap
of
rubbish
with
a
slug
of
copper
in
his
thigh
it
was
found
necessary
to
make
an
incision
in
order
to
extract
the
projectile
mademoiselle
vatnaz
arrived
the
same
evening
and
since
then
had
not
quitted
his
side
she
intelligently
prepared
everything
that
was
needed
for
the
dressings
assisted
him
in
taking
his
medicine
or
other
liquids
attended
to
his
slightest
wishes
left
and
returned
again
with
footsteps
more
light
than
those
of
a
fly
and
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
tenderness
frederick
during
the
two
following
weeks
did
not
fail
to
come
back
every
morning
one
day
while
he
was
speaking
about
the
devotion
of
the
vatnaz
dussardier
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
no
she
does
this
through
interested
motives
do
you
think
so
he
replied
i
am
sure
of
it
without
seeming
disposed
to
give
any
further
explanation
she
had
loaded
him
with
kindnesses
carrying
her
attentions
so
far
as
to
bring
him
the
newspapers
in
which
his
gallant
action
was
extolled
he
even
confessed
to
frederick
that
he
felt
uneasy
in
his
conscience
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
put
himself
on
the
other
side
with
the
men
in
blouses
for
indeed
a
heap
of
promises
had
been
made
to
them
which
had
not
been
carried
out
those
who
had
vanquished
them
hated
the
republic
and
in
the
next
place
they
had
treated
them
very
harshly
no
doubt
they
were
in
the
wrong
not
quite
however
and
the
honest
fellow
was
tormented
by
the
thought
that
he
might
have
fought
against
the
righteous
cause
sénécal
who
was
immured
in
the
tuileries
under
the
terrace
at
the
water
edge
had
none
of
this
mental
anguish
there
were
nine
hundred
men
in
the
place
huddled
together
in
the
midst
of
filth
without
the
slightest
order
their
faces
blackened
with
powder
and
clotted
blood
shivering
with
ague
and
breaking
out
into
cries
of
rage
and
those
who
were
brought
there
to
die
were
not
separated
from
the
rest
sometimes
on
hearing
the
sound
of
a
detonation
they
believed
that
they
were
all
going
to
be
shot
then
they
dashed
themselves
against
the
walls
and
after
that
fell
back
again
into
their
places
so
much
stupefied
by
suffering
that
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
were
living
in
a
nightmare
a
mournful
hallucination
the
lamp
which
hung
from
the
arched
roof
looked
like
a
stain
of
blood
and
little
green
and
yellow
flames
fluttered
about
caused
by
the
emanations
from
the
vault
through
fear
of
epidemics
a
commission
was
appointed
when
he
had
advanced
a
few
steps
the
president
recoiled
frightened
by
the
stench
from
the
excrements
and
from
the
corpses
as
soon
as
the
prisoners
drew
near
a
the
national
guards
who
were
on
sentry
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
shaking
the
bars
of
the
grating
prodded
them
indiscriminately
with
their
bayonets
as
a
rule
they
showed
no
pity
those
who
were
not
beaten
wished
to
signalise
themselves
there
was
a
regular
outbreak
of
fear
they
avenged
themselves
at
the
same
time
on
newspapers
clubs
mobs
everything
that
had
exasperated
them
during
the
last
three
months
and
in
spite
of
the
victory
that
had
been
gained
equality
as
if
for
the
punishment
of
its
defenders
and
the
exposure
of
its
enemies
to
ridicule
manifested
itself
in
a
triumphal
fashion
an
equality
of
brute
beasts
a
dead
level
of
sanguinary
vileness
for
the
fanaticism
of
balanced
the
madness
of
want
aristocracy
had
the
same
fits
of
fury
as
low
debauchery
and
the
cotton
cap
did
not
show
itself
less
hideous
than
the
red
cap
the
public
mind
was
agitated
just
as
it
would
be
after
great
convulsions
of
nature
sensible
men
were
rendered
imbeciles
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
on
account
of
it
père
roque
had
become
very
courageous
almost
foolhardy
having
arrived
on
the
at
paris
with
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
nogent
instead
of
going
back
at
the
same
time
with
them
he
had
gone
to
give
his
assistance
to
the
national
guard
encamped
at
the
tuileries
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
to
be
placed
on
sentry
in
front
of
the
terrace
at
the
water
side
there
at
any
rate
he
had
these
brigands
under
his
feet
he
was
delighted
to
find
that
they
were
beaten
and
humiliated
and
he
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
invectives
against
them
one
of
them
a
young
lad
with
long
fair
hair
put
his
face
to
the
bars
and
asked
for
bread
roque
ordered
him
to
hold
his
tongue
but
the
young
man
repeated
in
a
mournful
tone
bread
have
i
any
to
give
you
other
prisoners
presented
themselves
at
the
with
their
bristling
beards
their
burning
eyeballs
all
pushing
forward
and
yelling
bread
père
roque
was
indignant
at
seeing
his
authority
slighted
in
order
to
frighten
them
he
took
aim
at
them
and
borne
onward
into
the
vault
by
the
crush
that
nearly
smothered
him
the
young
man
with
his
head
thrown
backward
once
more
exclaimed
bread
hold
on
here
it
is
said
père
roque
firing
a
shot
from
his
gun
there
was
a
fearful
howl
then
silence
at
the
side
of
the
trough
something
white
could
be
seen
lying
after
this
roque
returned
to
his
abode
for
he
had
a
house
in
the
rue
which
he
used
as
a
temporary
residence
and
the
injury
done
to
the
front
of
the
building
during
the
riots
had
in
no
slight
degree
contributed
to
excite
his
rage
it
seemed
to
him
when
he
next
saw
it
that
he
had
exaggerated
the
amount
of
damage
done
to
it
his
recent
act
had
a
soothing
effect
on
him
as
if
it
indemnified
him
for
his
loss
it
was
his
daughter
herself
who
opened
the
door
for
him
she
immediately
made
the
remark
that
she
had
felt
uneasy
at
his
excessively
prolonged
absence
she
was
afraid
that
he
had
met
with
some
misfortune
that
he
had
been
wounded
this
manifestation
of
filial
love
softened
père
roque
he
was
astonished
that
she
should
have
set
out
on
a
journey
without
catherine
i
sent
her
out
on
a
message
was
louise
reply
and
she
made
enquiries
about
his
health
about
one
thing
or
another
then
with
an
air
of
indifference
she
asked
him
whether
he
had
chanced
to
come
across
frederick
no
i
did
see
him
it
was
on
his
account
alone
that
she
had
come
up
from
the
country
some
one
was
walking
at
that
moment
in
the
lobby
oh
excuse
me
and
she
disappeared
catherine
had
not
found
frederick
he
had
been
several
days
away
and
his
intimate
friend
deslauriers
was
now
living
in
the
provinces
louise
once
more
presented
herself
shaking
all
over
without
being
able
to
utter
a
word
she
leaned
against
the
furniture
what
the
matter
with
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
with
you
exclaimed
her
father
she
indicated
by
a
wave
of
her
hand
that
it
was
nothing
and
with
a
great
effort
of
will
she
regained
her
composure
the
keeper
of
the
restaurant
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
brought
them
soup
but
père
roque
had
passed
through
too
exciting
an
ordeal
to
be
able
to
control
his
emotions
he
is
not
likely
to
die
and
at
dessert
he
had
a
sort
of
fainting
fit
a
doctor
was
at
once
sent
for
and
he
prescribed
a
potion
then
when
roque
was
in
bed
he
asked
to
be
as
well
wrapped
up
as
possible
in
order
to
bring
on
perspiration
he
gasped
he
moaned
thanks
my
good
catherine
kiss
your
poor
father
my
chicken
ah
those
revolutions
and
when
his
daughter
scolded
him
for
having
made
himself
ill
by
tormenting
his
mind
on
her
account
he
replied
yes
you
are
right
but
i
could
help
it
i
am
too
sensitive
chapter

how
happy
could
i
be
with
either
madame
dambreuse
in
her
boudoir
between
her
niece
and
miss
john
was
listening
to
roque
as
he
described
the
severe
military
duties
he
had
been
forced
to
perform
she
was
biting
her
lips
and
appeared
to
be
in
pain
oh
is
nothing
it
will
pass
away
and
with
a
gracious
air
we
are
going
to
have
an
acquaintance
of
yours
at
dinner
with
us
monsieur
moreau
louise
gave
a
start
oh
we
only
have
a
few
intimate
friends
there
amongst
others
alfred
de
cisy
and
she
spoke
in
terms
of
high
praise
about
his
manners
his
personal
appearance
and
especially
his
moral
character
madame
dambreuse
was
nearer
to
a
correct
estimate
of
the
state
of
affairs
than
she
imagined
the
vicomte
was
contemplating
marriage
he
said
so
to
martinon
adding
that
mademoiselle
cécile
was
certain
to
like
him
and
that
her
parents
would
accept
him
to
warrant
him
in
going
so
far
as
to
confide
to
another
his
intentions
on
the
point
he
ought
to
have
satisfactory
information
with
regard
to
her
dowry
now
martinon
had
a
suspicion
that
cécile
was
natural
daughter
and
it
is
probable
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
strong
step
on
his
part
to
ask
for
her
hand
at
any
risk
such
audacity
of
course
was
not
unaccompanied
by
danger
and
for
this
reason
martinon
had
up
to
the
present
acted
in
a
way
that
could
not
compromise
him
besides
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
well
get
rid
of
the
aunt
confidence
induced
him
to
make
up
his
mind
and
he
had
formally
made
his
proposal
to
the
banker
who
seeing
no
obstacle
to
it
had
just
informed
madame
dambreuse
about
the
matter
cisy
presently
made
his
appearance
she
arose
and
said
you
have
forgotten
us
cécile
shake
hands
at
the
same
moment
frederick
entered
the
room
ha
at
last
we
have
found
you
again
exclaimed
père
roque
i
called
with
cécile
on
you
three
times
this
week
frederick
had
carefully
avoided
them
he
pleaded
by
way
of
excuse
that
he
spent
all
his
days
beside
a
wounded
comrade
for
a
long
time
however
a
heap
of
misfortunes
had
happened
to
him
and
he
tried
to
invent
stories
to
explain
his
conduct
luckily
the
guests
arrived
in
the
midst
of
his
explanation
first
of
all
paul
de
grémonville
the
diplomatist
whom
he
met
at
the
ball
then
fumichon
that
manufacturer
whose
conservative
zeal
had
scandalised
him
one
evening
after
them
came
the
old
duchesse
de
montreuil
nantua
but
two
loud
voices
in
the
anteroom
reached
his
ears
they
were
that
of
de
nonancourt
an
old
beau
with
the
air
of
a
mummy
preserved
in
cold
cream
and
that
of
madame
de
larsillois
the
wife
of
a
prefect
of
louis
philippe
she
was
terribly
frightened
for
she
had
just
heard
an
organ
playing
a
polka
which
was
a
signal
amongst
the
insurgents
many
of
the
wealthy
class
of
citizens
had
similar
apprehensions
they
thought
that
men
in
the
catacombs
were
going
to
blow
up
the
faubourg
some
noises
escaped
from
cellars
and
things
that
excited
suspicion
were
passed
up
to
windows
everyone
in
the
meantime
made
an
effort
to
calm
madame
de
larsillois
order
was
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
fear
cavaignac
has
saved
us
as
if
the
horrors
of
the
insurrection
had
not
been
sufficiently
numerous
they
exaggerated
them
there
had
been
thousand
convicts
on
the
side
of
the
socialists
no
less
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
food
had
been
poisoned
that
gardes
mobiles
had
been
sawn
between
two
planks
and
that
there
had
been
inscriptions
on
flags
inciting
the
people
to
pillage
and
incendiarism
aye
and
something
more
added
the
oh
dear
said
madame
dambreuse
whose
modesty
was
shocked
while
she
indicated
the
three
young
girls
with
a
glance
dambreuse
came
forth
from
his
study
accompanied
by
martinon
she
turned
her
head
round
and
responded
to
a
bow
from
pellerin
who
was
advancing
towards
her
the
artist
gazed
in
a
restless
fashion
towards
the
walls
the
banker
took
him
aside
and
conveyed
to
him
that
it
was
desirable
for
the
present
to
conceal
his
revolutionary
picture
no
doubt
said
pellerin
the
rebuff
which
he
received
at
the
club
of
intellect
having
modified
his
opinions
dambreuse
let
it
slip
out
very
politely
that
he
would
give
him
orders
for
other
works
but
excuse
me
ah
my
dear
friend
what
a
pleasure
arnoux
and
madame
arnoux
stood
before
frederick
he
had
a
sort
of
vertigo
rosanette
had
been
irritating
him
all
the
afternoon
with
her
display
of
admiration
for
soldiers
and
the
old
passion
was
the
steward
came
to
announce
that
dinner
was
on
the
table
with
a
look
she
directed
the
vicomte
to
take
cécile
arm
while
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
martinon
you
wretch
and
then
they
passed
into
the
under
the
green
leaves
of
a
pineapple
in
the
middle
of
the
a
dorado
stood
with
its
snout
reaching
towards
a
quarter
of
roebuck
and
its
tail
just
grazing
a
bushy
dish
of
crayfish
figs
huge
cherries
pears
and
grapes
the
first
fruits
of
parisian
cultivation
rose
like
pyramids
in
baskets
of
old
saxe
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
flowers
mingled
with
the
shining
silver
plate
the
white
silk
blinds
drawn
down
in
front
of
the
windows
filled
the
apartment
with
a
mellow
light
it
was
cooled
by
two
fountains
in
which
there
were
pieces
of
ice
and
tall
in
short
breeches
waited
on
them
all
these
luxuries
seemed
more
precious
after
the
emotion
of
the
past
few
days
they
felt
a
fresh
delight
at
possessing
things
which
they
had
been
afraid
of
losing
and
nonancourt
expressed
the
general
sentiment
when
he
said
ah
let
us
hope
that
these
republican
gentlemen
will
allow
us
to
dine
in
spite
of
their
fraternity
père
roque
added
with
an
attempt
at
wit
these
two
personages
were
placed
respectively
at
the
right
and
at
the
left
of
madame
dambreuse
her
husband
being
exactly
opposite
her
between
madame
larsillois
at
whose
side
was
the
diplomatist
and
the
old
duchesse
whom
fumichon
elbowed
then
came
the
painter
the
dealer
in
faïence
and
mademoiselle
louise
and
thanks
to
martinon
who
had
carried
her
chair
to
enable
her
to
take
a
seat
near
louise
frederick
found
himself
beside
madame
arnoux
she
wore
a
black
barège
gown
a
gold
hoop
on
her
wrist
and
as
on
the
first
day
that
he
dined
at
her
house
something
red
in
her
hair
a
branch
of
fuchsia
twisted
round
her
chignon
he
could
not
help
saying
is
a
long
time
since
we
saw
each
other
ah
she
returned
coldly
he
went
on
in
a
mild
tone
which
mitigated
the
impertinence
of
his
question
have
you
thought
of
me
now
and
then
why
should
i
think
of
you
frederick
was
hurt
by
these
words
you
are
right
perhaps
after
all
but
very
soon
regretting
what
he
had
said
he
swore
that
he
had
not
lived
a
single
day
without
being
ravaged
by
the
remembrance
of
her
i
do
believe
a
single
word
of
it
monsieur
however
you
know
that
i
love
you
madame
arnoux
made
no
reply
you
know
that
i
love
you
she
still
kept
silent
well
then
go
be
hanged
said
frederick
to
himself
and
as
he
raised
his
eyes
he
perceived
mademoiselle
roque
at
the
other
side
of
madame
arnoux
she
thought
it
gave
her
a
coquettish
look
to
dress
entirely
in
green
a
colour
which
contrasted
horribly
with
her
red
hair
the
buckle
of
her
belt
was
large
and
her
collar
cramped
her
neck
this
lack
of
elegance
had
no
doubt
contributed
to
the
coldness
which
frederick
at
first
displayed
towards
her
she
watched
him
from
where
she
sat
some
distance
away
from
him
with
curious
glances
and
arnoux
close
to
her
side
in
vain
lavished
his
gallantries
he
could
not
get
her
to
utter
three
words
so
that
finally
abandoning
all
hope
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
her
he
listened
to
the
conversation
she
now
began
rolling
about
a
slice
of
luxembourg
pineapple
in
her
louis
blanc
according
to
fumichon
owned
a
large
house
in
the
rue
which
he
refused
to
let
to
the
workmen
for
my
part
i
think
it
rather
a
funny
thing
said
nonancourt
to
see
hunting
over
the
crown
lands
he
owes
twenty
thousand
francs
to
a
goldsmith
cisy
interposed
and
maintained
madame
darnbreuse
stopped
him
ah
how
nasty
it
is
to
be
getting
hot
about
politics
and
for
such
a
young
man
too
fie
fie
pay
attention
rather
to
your
fair
neighbour
after
this
those
who
were
of
a
grave
turn
of
mind
attacked
the
newspapers
arnoux
took
it
on
himself
to
defend
them
frederick
mixed
himself
up
in
the
discussion
describing
them
as
commercial
establishments
just
like
any
other
house
of
business
those
who
wrote
for
them
were
as
a
rule
imbeciles
or
humbugs
he
gave
his
listeners
to
understand
that
he
was
acquainted
with
journalists
and
combated
with
sarcasms
his
friend
generous
sentiments
madame
arnoux
did
not
notice
that
this
was
said
through
a
feeling
of
spite
against
her
meanwhile
the
vicomte
was
torturing
his
brain
in
the
effort
to
make
a
conquest
of
mademoiselle
cécile
he
commenced
by
finding
fault
with
the
shape
of
the
decanters
and
the
graving
of
the
knives
in
order
to
show
his
artistic
tastes
then
he
talked
about
his
stable
his
tailor
and
his
shirtmaker
finally
he
took
up
the
subject
of
religion
and
seized
the
opportunity
of
conveying
to
her
that
he
fulfilled
all
his
duties
martinon
set
to
work
in
a
better
fashion
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
continually
he
praised
in
a
monotonous
fashion
her
birdlike
profile
her
dull
fair
hair
and
her
hands
which
were
unusually
short
the
young
girl
was
delighted
at
this
shower
of
flatteries
it
was
impossible
to
hear
anything
as
all
present
were
talking
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
roque
wanted
an
iron
hand
to
govern
france
nonancourt
even
regretted
that
the
political
scaffold
was
abolished
they
ought
to
have
all
these
scoundrels
put
to
death
together
now
that
i
think
of
it
are
we
speaking
of
dussardier
said
dambreuse
turning
towards
frederick
the
worthy
shopman
was
now
a
hero
like
sallesse
the
brothers
jeanson
the
wife
of
pequillet
etc
frederick
without
waiting
to
be
asked
related
his
friend
history
it
threw
around
him
a
kind
of
halo
then
they
came
quite
naturally
to
refer
to
different
traits
of
courage
according
to
the
diplomatist
it
was
not
hard
to
face
death
witness
the
case
of
men
who
fight
duels
we
might
take
the
vicomte
testimony
on
that
point
said
martinon
the
vicomte
face
got
very
flushed
the
guests
stared
at
him
and
louise
more
astonished
than
the
rest
murmured
what
is
it
pray
he
before
frederick
returned
arnoux
in
a
very
low
tone
do
you
know
anything
mademoiselle
said
nonancourt
presently
and
he
repeated
her
answer
to
madame
dambreuse
who
bending
forward
a
little
began
to
fix
her
gaze
on
frederick
martinon
did
not
wait
for
cécile
questions
he
informed
her
that
this
affair
had
reference
to
a
woman
of
improper
character
the
young
girl
drew
back
slightly
in
her
chair
as
if
to
escape
from
contact
with
such
a
libertine
the
conversation
was
renewed
the
great
wines
of
bordeaux
were
sent
round
and
the
guests
became
animated
pellerin
had
a
dislike
to
the
revolution
because
he
attributed
to
it
the
complete
loss
of
the
spanish
museum
this
is
what
grieved
him
most
as
a
painter
as
he
made
the
latter
remark
roque
asked
are
you
not
yourself
the
painter
of
a
very
notable
picture
perhaps
what
is
it
it
represents
a
lady
in
a
costume
faith
a
little
light
with
a
purse
and
a
peacock
behind
frederick
in
his
turn
reddened
pellerin
pretended
that
he
had
not
heard
the
words
nevertheless
it
is
certainly
by
you
for
your
name
is
written
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
there
is
a
line
on
it
stating
that
it
is
monsieur
moreau
property
one
day
when
père
roque
and
his
daughter
were
waiting
at
his
residence
to
see
him
they
saw
the
maréchale
portrait
the
old
gentleman
had
even
taken
it
for
a
gothic
painting
no
said
pellerin
rudely
is
a
woman
portrait
martinon
added
and
a
living
woman
too
and
no
mistake
is
that
so
cisy
oh
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
thought
you
were
acquainted
with
her
but
since
it
causes
you
pain
i
must
beg
a
thousand
pardons
cisy
lowered
his
eyes
proving
by
his
embarrassment
that
he
must
have
played
a
pitiable
part
in
connection
with
this
portrait
as
for
frederick
the
model
could
only
be
his
mistress
it
was
one
of
those
convictions
which
are
immediately
formed
and
the
faces
of
the
assembly
revealed
it
with
the
utmost
clearness
how
he
lied
to
me
said
madame
arnoux
to
herself
it
is
for
her
then
that
he
left
me
thought
louise
frederick
had
an
idea
that
these
two
stories
might
compromise
him
and
when
they
were
in
the
garden
mademoiselle
cécile
wooer
burst
out
laughing
in
his
face
oh
not
at
all
do
you
good
go
ahead
what
did
he
mean
besides
what
was
the
cause
of
this
good
nature
so
contrary
to
his
usual
conduct
without
giving
any
explanation
he
proceeded
towards
the
lower
end
where
the
ladies
were
seated
the
men
were
standing
round
them
and
in
their
midst
pellerin
was
giving
vent
to
his
ideas
the
form
of
government
most
favourable
for
the
arts
was
an
enlightened
monarchy
he
was
disgusted
with
modern
times
if
it
were
only
on
account
of
the
national
guard
he
regretted
the
middle
ages
and
the
days
of
louis
xiv
roque
congratulated
him
on
his
opinions
confessing
that
they
overcame
all
his
prejudices
against
artists
but
almost
without
a
moment
delay
he
went
off
when
the
voice
of
fumichon
attracted
his
attention
arnoux
tried
to
prove
that
there
were
two
socialisms
a
good
and
a
bad
the
manufacturer
saw
no
difference
whatever
between
them
his
head
becoming
dizzy
with
rage
at
the
utterance
of
the
word
property
is
a
law
written
on
the
face
of
nature
children
cling
to
their
toys
all
peoples
all
animals
are
of
my
opinion
the
lion
even
if
he
were
able
to
speak
would
declare
himself
a
proprietor
thus
i
myself
messieurs
began
with
a
capital
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
would
you
be
surprised
to
hear
that
for
thirty
years
i
used
to
get
up
at
four
every
morning
i
had
as
much
pain
as
five
hundred
devils
in
making
my
fortune
and
people
will
come
and
tell
me
i
not
the
master
that
my
money
is
not
my
money
in
short
that
property
is
theft
but
proudhon
let
me
alone
with
your
proudhon
if
he
were
here
i
think
i
strangle
him
he
would
have
strangled
him
after
the
intoxicating
drink
he
had
swallowed
fumichon
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about
any
longer
and
his
apoplectic
face
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
like
a
bombshell
good
morrow
arnoux
said
hussonnet
who
was
walking
briskly
over
the
grass
he
brought
dambreuse
the
first
leaf
of
a
pamphlet
bearing
the
title
of
the
hydra
the
bohemian
defending
the
interests
of
a
reactionary
club
and
in
that
capacity
he
was
introduced
by
the
banker
to
his
guests
hussonnet
amused
them
by
relating
how
the
dealers
in
tallow
hired
three
hundred
and
street
boys
to
bawl
out
every
evening
lamps
h
and
then
turning
into
ridicule
the
principles
of
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
and
the
orators
of
the
left
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
do
prudhomme
on
a
barricade
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
a
kind
of
jealousy
of
these
rich
people
who
had
enjoyed
a
good
dinner
the
caricature
did
not
please
them
overmuch
their
faces
grew
long
this
however
was
not
a
time
for
joking
so
nonancourt
observed
as
he
recalled
the
death
of
monseigneur
affre
and
that
of
general
de
bréa
these
events
were
being
constantly
alluded
to
and
arguments
were
constructed
out
of
them
roque
described
the
archbishop
end
as
everything
that
one
could
call
sublime
fumichon
gave
the
palm
to
the
military
personage
and
instead
of
simply
expressing
regret
for
these
two
murders
they
held
disputes
with
a
view
to
determining
which
ought
to
excite
the
greatest
indignation
a
second
comparison
was
next
instituted
namely
between
lamoricière
and
cavaignac
dambreuse
glorifying
cavaignac
and
nonancourt
lamoricière
h
the
word
also
means
translator
not
one
of
the
persons
present
with
the
exception
of
arnoux
had
ever
seen
either
of
them
engaged
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
none
the
less
everyone
formulated
an
irrevocable
judgment
with
reference
to
their
operations
frederick
however
declined
to
give
an
opinion
on
the
matter
confessing
that
he
had
not
served
as
a
soldier
the
diplomatist
and
dambreuse
gave
him
an
approving
nod
of
the
head
in
fact
to
have
fought
against
the
insurrection
was
to
have
defended
the
republic
the
result
although
favourable
consolidated
it
and
now
they
had
got
rid
of
the
vanquished
they
wanted
to
be
conquerors
as
soon
as
they
had
got
out
into
the
garden
madame
dambreuse
taking
cisy
aside
chided
him
for
his
awkwardness
when
she
caught
sight
of
martinon
she
sent
him
away
and
then
tried
to
learn
from
her
future
nephew
the
cause
of
his
witticisms
at
the
vicomte
expense
there
nothing
of
the
kind
and
all
this
as
it
were
for
the
glory
of
moreau
what
is
the
object
of
it
there
no
object
frederick
is
a
charming
fellow
i
am
very
fond
of
him
and
so
am
i
too
let
him
come
here
go
and
look
for
him
after
two
or
three
commonplace
phrases
she
began
by
lightly
disparaging
her
guests
and
in
this
way
she
placed
him
on
a
higher
level
than
the
others
he
did
not
fail
to
run
down
the
rest
of
the
ladies
more
or
less
which
was
an
ingenious
way
of
paying
her
compliments
but
she
left
his
side
from
time
to
time
as
it
was
a
and
ladies
were
every
moment
arriving
then
she
returned
to
her
seat
and
the
entirely
accidental
arrangement
of
the
chairs
enabled
them
to
avoid
being
overheard
she
showed
herself
playful
and
yet
grave
melancholy
and
yet
quite
rational
her
daily
occupations
interested
her
very
little
there
was
an
order
of
sentiments
of
a
less
transitory
kind
she
complained
of
the
poets
who
misrepresent
the
facts
of
life
then
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
heaven
asking
of
him
what
was
the
name
of
a
star
two
or
three
chinese
lanterns
had
been
suspended
from
the
trees
the
wind
shook
them
and
lines
of
coloured
light
quivered
on
her
white
dress
she
sat
after
her
usual
fashion
a
little
back
in
her
armchair
with
a
footstool
in
front
of
her
the
tip
of
a
black
satin
shoe
could
be
seen
and
at
intervals
madame
dambreuse
allowed
a
louder
word
than
usual
and
sometimes
even
a
laugh
to
escape
her
these
coquetries
did
not
affect
martinon
who
was
occupied
with
cécile
but
they
were
bound
to
make
an
impression
on
roque
daughter
who
was
chatting
with
madame
arnoux
she
was
the
only
member
of
her
own
sex
present
whose
manners
did
not
appear
disdainful
louise
came
and
sat
beside
her
then
yielding
to
the
desire
to
give
vent
to
her
emotions
does
he
not
talk
well
frederick
moreau
i
mean
do
you
know
him
oh
intimately
we
are
neighbours
and
he
used
to
amuse
himself
with
me
when
i
was
quite
a
little
girl
madame
arnoux
cast
at
her
a
sidelong
glance
which
meant
i
suppose
you
are
not
in
love
with
him
the
young
girl
face
replied
with
an
untroubled
look
yes
you
see
him
often
then
oh
no
only
when
he
comes
to
his
mother
house
is
ten
months
now
since
he
came
he
promised
however
to
be
more
particular
the
promises
of
men
are
not
to
be
too
much
relied
on
my
child
but
he
has
not
deceived
me
as
he
did
others
louise
shivered
can
it
be
by
any
chance
that
he
promised
something
to
her
and
her
features
became
distracted
with
distrust
and
hate
madame
arnoux
was
almost
afraid
of
her
she
would
have
gladly
withdrawn
what
she
had
said
then
both
became
silent
as
frederick
was
sitting
opposite
them
on
a
they
kept
staring
at
him
the
one
with
propriety
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
the
other
boldly
with
parted
lips
so
that
madame
dambreuse
said
to
him
come
now
turn
round
and
let
her
have
a
good
look
at
you
whom
do
you
mean
why
monsieur
roque
daughter
and
she
rallied
him
on
having
won
the
heart
of
this
young
girl
from
the
provinces
he
denied
that
this
was
so
and
tried
to
make
a
laugh
of
it
is
it
credible
i
ask
you
such
an
ugly
creature
however
he
experienced
an
intense
feeling
of
gratified
vanity
he
recalled
to
mind
the
reunion
from
which
he
had
returned
one
night
some
time
before
his
heart
filled
with
bitter
humiliation
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
now
in
the
environment
that
really
suited
him
as
if
all
these
things
including
the
dambreuse
mansion
belonged
to
himself
the
ladies
formed
a
semicircle
around
him
while
they
listened
to
what
he
was
saying
and
in
order
to
create
an
effect
he
declared
that
he
was
in
favor
of
the
of
divorce
which
he
maintained
should
be
easily
procurable
so
as
to
enable
people
to
quit
one
another
and
come
back
to
one
another
without
any
limit
as
often
as
they
liked
they
uttered
loud
protests
a
few
of
them
began
to
talk
in
whispers
little
exclamations
every
now
and
then
burst
forth
from
the
place
where
the
wall
was
overshadowed
with
aristolochia
one
would
imagine
that
it
was
a
mirthful
cackling
of
hens
and
he
developed
his
theory
with
that
which
is
generated
by
the
consciousness
of
success
a
brought
into
the
arbour
a
tray
laden
with
ices
the
gentlemen
drew
close
together
and
began
to
chat
about
the
recent
arrests
thereupon
frederick
revenged
himself
on
the
vicomte
by
making
him
believe
that
he
might
be
prosecuted
as
a
legitimist
the
other
urged
by
way
of
reply
that
he
had
not
stirred
outside
his
own
room
his
adversary
enumerated
in
a
heap
the
possible
mischances
mm
dambreuse
and
grémonville
found
the
discussion
very
amusing
then
they
paid
frederick
compliments
while
expressing
regret
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
not
employ
his
abilities
in
the
defence
of
order
they
grasped
his
hand
with
the
utmost
warmth
he
might
for
the
future
count
on
them
at
last
just
as
everyone
was
leaving
the
vicomte
made
a
low
bow
to
cécile
mademoiselle
i
have
the
honour
of
wishing
you
a
very
good
evening
she
replied
coldly
good
evening
but
she
gave
martinon
a
parting
smile
pére
roque
in
order
to
continue
the
conversation
between
himself
and
arnoux
offered
to
see
him
home
as
well
as
madame
they
were
going
the
same
way
louise
and
frederick
walked
in
front
of
them
she
had
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
when
she
was
some
distance
away
from
the
others
she
said
ah
at
last
at
last
i
had
enough
to
bear
all
the
evening
how
nasty
those
women
were
what
haughty
airs
they
had
he
made
an
effort
to
defend
them
first
of
all
you
might
certainly
have
spoken
to
me
the
moment
you
came
in
after
being
away
a
whole
year
it
was
not
a
year
said
frederick
glad
to
be
able
to
give
some
sort
of
rejoinder
on
this
point
in
order
to
avoid
the
other
questions
be
it
so
the
time
appeared
very
long
to
me
that
all
but
during
this
horrid
dinner
one
would
think
you
felt
ashamed
of
me
ah
i
understand
i
do
possess
what
is
needed
in
order
to
please
as
they
do
you
are
mistaken
said
frederick
really
swear
to
me
that
you
do
love
anyone
he
did
swear
you
love
nobody
but
me
alone
i
assure
you
i
do
not
this
assurance
filled
her
with
delight
she
would
have
liked
to
lose
her
way
in
the
streets
so
that
they
might
walk
about
together
the
whole
night
i
have
been
so
much
tormented
down
there
nothing
was
talked
about
but
barricades
i
imagined
i
saw
you
falling
on
your
back
covered
with
blood
your
mother
was
confined
to
her
bed
with
rheumatism
she
knew
nothing
about
what
was
happening
i
had
to
hold
my
tongue
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
so
i
took
catherine
with
me
and
she
related
to
him
all
about
her
departure
her
journey
and
the
lie
she
told
her
father
he
bringing
me
back
in
two
days
come
evening
as
if
you
were
merely
paying
a
casual
visit
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
ask
for
my
hand
in
marriage
never
had
frederick
been
further
from
the
idea
of
marriage
besides
mademoiselle
roque
appeared
to
him
a
rather
absurd
young
person
how
different
she
was
from
a
woman
like
madame
dambreuse
a
very
different
future
was
in
store
for
him
he
had
found
reason
to
feel
perfectly
certain
on
that
point
and
therefore
this
was
not
the
time
to
involve
himself
from
mere
sentimental
motives
in
a
step
of
such
momentous
importance
it
was
necessary
now
to
be
decisive
and
then
he
had
seen
madame
arnoux
once
more
nevertheless
he
was
rather
embarrassed
by
louise
candour
he
said
in
reply
to
her
last
words
have
you
considered
this
matter
how
is
that
she
exclaimed
frozen
with
astonishment
and
indignation
he
said
that
to
marry
at
such
a
time
as
this
would
be
a
piece
of
folly
so
you
do
want
to
have
me
nay
you
do
understand
me
and
he
plunged
into
a
confused
mass
of
verbiage
in
order
to
impress
upon
her
that
he
was
kept
back
by
more
serious
considerations
that
he
had
business
on
hand
which
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
dispose
of
that
even
his
inheritance
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy
louise
cut
all
this
explanation
short
with
one
plain
word
that
last
of
all
the
present
political
situation
made
the
thing
undesirable
so
then
the
most
reasonable
course
was
to
wait
patiently
for
some
time
matters
would
no
doubt
right
themselves
at
least
he
hoped
so
and
as
he
could
think
of
no
further
grounds
to
go
upon
just
at
that
moment
he
pretended
to
have
been
suddenly
reminded
that
he
should
have
been
with
dussardier
two
hours
ago
then
bowing
to
the
others
he
darted
down
the
rue
hauteville
took
a
turn
round
the
gymnase
returned
to
the
boulevard
and
quickly
rushed
up
rosanette
four
flights
of
stairs
and
madame
arnoux
left
pére
roque
and
his
daughter
at
the
entrance
of
the
rue
husband
and
wife
returned
home
without
exchanging
a
word
as
he
was
unable
to
continue
chattering
any
longer
feeling
quite
worn
out
she
even
leaned
against
his
shoulder
he
was
the
only
man
who
had
displayed
any
honourable
sentiments
during
the
evening
she
entertained
towards
him
feelings
of
the
utmost
indulgence
meanwhile
he
cherished
a
certain
degree
of
spite
against
frederick
did
you
notice
his
face
when
a
question
was
asked
about
the
portrait
when
i
told
you
that
he
was
her
lover
you
did
not
wish
to
believe
what
i
said
oh
yes
i
was
wrong
arnoux
gratified
with
his
triumph
pressed
the
matter
even
further
i
even
make
a
bet
that
when
he
left
us
a
little
while
ago
he
went
to
see
her
again
he
with
her
at
this
moment
you
may
be
sure
finishing
the
evening
with
her
madame
arnoux
had
pulled
down
her
hat
very
low
why
you
shaking
all
over
that
because
i
feel
cold
was
her
reply
as
soon
as
her
father
was
asleep
louise
made
her
way
into
room
and
catching
her
by
the
shoulders
shook
her
get
up
quick
as
quick
as
ever
you
can
and
go
and
fetch
a
cab
for
me
catherine
replied
that
there
was
not
one
to
be
had
at
such
an
hour
will
you
come
with
me
yourself
there
then
where
might
i
ask
to
frederick
house
impossible
what
do
you
want
to
go
there
for
it
was
in
order
to
have
a
talk
with
him
she
could
not
wait
she
must
see
him
immediately
just
think
of
what
you
about
to
do
to
present
yourself
this
way
at
a
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
besides
he
asleep
by
this
time
i
wake
him
up
but
this
is
not
a
proper
thing
for
a
young
girl
to
do
i
am
not
a
young
girl
i
his
wife
i
love
him
come
put
on
your
shawl
catherine
standing
at
the
side
of
the
bed
was
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
how
to
act
she
said
at
last
no
i
wo
go
well
stay
behind
then
i
go
there
by
myself
louise
glided
like
an
adder
towards
the
staircase
catherine
rushed
after
her
and
came
up
with
her
on
the
footpath
outside
the
house
her
remonstrances
were
fruitless
and
she
followed
the
girl
fastening
her
undervest
as
she
hurried
along
in
the
rear
the
walk
appeared
to
her
exceedingly
tedious
she
complained
that
her
legs
were
getting
weak
from
age
i
go
on
after
you
faith
i
have
the
same
thing
to
drive
me
on
that
you
have
then
she
grew
softened
poor
soul
you
have
anyone
now
but
your
catau
do
you
see
from
time
to
time
scruples
took
hold
of
her
mind
ah
this
is
a
nice
thing
you
making
me
do
suppose
your
father
happened
to
wake
and
miss
you
lord
god
let
us
hope
no
misfortune
will
happen
in
front
of
the
théâtre
des
variétés
a
patrol
of
national
guards
stopped
them
louise
immediately
explained
that
she
was
going
with
her
servant
to
look
for
a
doctor
in
the
rue
rumfort
the
patrol
allowed
them
to
pass
on
at
the
corner
of
the
madeleine
they
came
across
a
second
patrol
and
louise
having
given
the
same
explanation
one
of
the
national
guards
asked
in
return
is
it
for
a
nine
months
ailment
ducky
oh
damn
it
exclaimed
the
captain
no
blackguardisms
in
the
ranks
pass
on
ladies
in
spite
of
the
captain
orders
they
still
kept
cracking
jokes
i
wish
you
much
joy
my
respects
to
the
doctor
mind
the
wolf
they
like
laughing
catherine
remarked
in
a
loud
tone
that
the
way
it
is
to
be
young
at
length
they
reached
frederick
abode
louise
gave
the
bell
a
vigorous
pull
which
she
repeated
several
times
the
door
opened
a
little
and
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
the
porter
said
no
but
he
must
be
in
bed
i
tell
you
he
not
why
for
nearly
three
months
he
has
not
slept
at
home
and
the
little
pane
of
the
lodge
fell
down
sharply
like
the
blade
of
a
guillotine
they
remained
in
the
darkness
under
the
archway
an
angry
voice
cried
out
to
them
be
off
the
door
was
again
opened
they
went
away
louise
had
to
sit
down
on
a
and
clasping
her
face
with
her
hands
she
wept
copious
tears
welling
up
from
her
full
heart
the
day
was
breaking
and
carts
were
making
their
way
into
the
city
catherine
led
her
back
home
holding
her
up
kissing
her
and
offering
her
every
sort
of
consolation
that
she
could
extract
from
her
own
experience
she
need
not
give
herself
so
much
trouble
about
a
lover
if
this
one
failed
her
she
could
find
others

unpleasant
news
from
rosanette
when
rosanette
enthusiasm
for
the
gardes
mobiles
had
calmed
down
she
became
more
charming
than
ever
and
frederick
insensibly
glided
into
the
habit
of
living
with
her
the
best
portion
of
the
day
was
the
morning
on
the
terrace
in
a
light
cambric
dress
and
with
her
stockingless
feet
thrust
into
slippers
she
kept
moving
about
him
went
and
cleaned
her
canaries
cage
gave
her
some
water
and
with
a
did
a
little
amateur
gardening
in
the
box
filled
with
clay
from
which
arose
a
trellis
of
nasturtiums
giving
an
attractive
look
to
the
wall
then
resting
with
their
elbows
on
the
balcony
they
stood
side
by
side
gazing
at
the
vehicles
and
the
and
they
warmed
themselves
in
the
sunlight
and
made
plans
for
spending
the
evening
he
absented
himself
only
for
two
hours
at
most
and
after
that
they
would
go
to
some
theatre
where
they
would
get
seats
in
front
of
the
stage
and
rosanette
with
a
large
bouquet
of
flowers
in
her
hand
would
listen
to
the
instruments
while
frederick
leaning
close
to
her
ear
would
tell
her
comic
or
amatory
stories
at
other
times
they
took
an
open
carriage
to
drive
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
they
kept
walking
about
slowly
until
the
middle
of
the
night
at
last
they
made
their
way
home
through
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
the
grand
avenue
inhaling
the
breeze
with
the
stars
above
their
heads
and
with
all
the
ranged
in
the
background
of
the
perspective
like
a
double
string
of
luminous
pearls
frederick
always
waited
for
her
when
they
were
going
out
together
she
was
a
very
long
time
fastening
the
two
ribbons
of
her
bonnet
and
she
smiled
at
herself
in
the
mirror
set
in
the
wardrobe
then
she
would
draw
her
arm
over
his
and
making
him
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
beside
her
we
produce
a
good
effect
in
this
way
the
two
of
us
side
by
side
ah
my
poor
darling
i
could
eat
you
he
was
now
her
chattel
her
property
she
wore
on
her
face
a
continuous
radiance
while
at
the
same
time
she
appeared
more
languishing
in
manner
more
rounded
in
figure
and
without
being
able
to
explain
in
what
way
he
found
her
altered
nevertheless
one
day
she
informed
him
as
if
it
were
a
very
important
bit
of
news
that
my
lord
arnoux
had
lately
set
up
a
shop
for
a
woman
who
was
formerly
employed
in
his
he
used
to
go
there
every
evening
he
spent
a
great
deal
on
it
no
later
than
a
week
ago
he
had
even
given
her
a
set
of
rosewood
furniture
how
do
you
know
that
said
frederick
oh
i
sure
of
it
delphine
while
carrying
out
some
orders
for
her
had
made
enquiries
about
the
matter
she
must
then
be
much
attached
to
arnoux
to
take
such
a
deep
interest
in
his
movements
he
contented
himself
with
saying
to
her
in
reply
what
does
this
signify
to
you
rosanette
looked
surprised
at
this
question
why
the
rascal
owes
me
money
is
it
atrocious
to
see
him
keeping
beggars
then
with
an
expression
of
triumphant
hate
in
her
face
besides
she
is
having
a
nice
laugh
at
him
she
has
three
others
on
hand
so
much
the
better
and
i
be
glad
if
she
eats
him
up
even
to
the
last
farthing
arnoux
had
in
fact
let
himself
be
made
use
of
by
the
girl
from
bordeaux
with
the
indulgence
which
characterises
senile
attachments
his
manufactory
was
no
longer
going
on
the
entire
state
of
his
affairs
was
pitiable
so
that
in
order
to
set
them
afloat
again
he
was
at
first
projecting
the
establishment
of
a
at
which
only
patriotic
pieces
would
be
sung
with
a
grant
from
the
minister
this
establishment
would
become
at
the
same
time
a
focus
for
the
purpose
of
propagandism
and
a
source
of
profit
now
that
power
had
been
directed
into
a
different
channel
the
thing
was
impossible
his
next
idea
was
a
big
military
business
he
lacked
capital
however
to
give
it
a
start
he
was
not
more
fortunate
in
his
domestic
life
madame
arnoux
was
less
agreeable
in
manner
towards
him
sometimes
even
a
little
rude
berthe
always
took
her
father
part
this
increased
the
discord
and
the
house
was
becoming
intolerable
he
often
set
forth
in
the
morning
passed
his
day
in
making
long
excursions
out
of
the
city
in
order
to
divert
his
thoughts
then
dined
at
a
rustic
tavern
abandoning
himself
to
his
reflections
the
prolonged
absence
of
frederick
disturbed
his
habits
then
he
presented
himself
one
afternoon
begged
of
him
to
come
and
see
him
as
in
former
days
and
obtained
from
him
a
promise
to
do
so
frederick
did
not
feel
sufficient
courage
within
him
to
go
back
to
madame
arnoux
house
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
betrayed
her
but
this
conduct
was
very
pusillanimous
there
was
no
excuse
for
it
there
was
only
one
way
of
ending
the
matter
and
so
one
evening
he
set
out
on
his
way
as
the
rain
was
falling
he
had
just
turned
up
the
passage
jouffroy
when
under
the
light
shed
from
the
a
fat
little
man
accosted
him
frederick
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
compain
that
orator
whose
motion
had
excited
so
much
laughter
at
the
club
he
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
an
individual
whose
head
was
muffled
in
a
red
cap
with
a
very
long
upper
lip
a
complexion
as
yellow
as
an
orange
a
tuft
of
beard
under
his
jaw
and
big
staring
eyes
listening
with
wonder
compain
was
no
doubt
proud
of
him
for
he
said
let
me
introduce
you
to
this
jolly
dog
he
is
a
bootmaker
whom
i
include
amongst
my
friends
come
and
let
us
take
something
frederick
having
thanked
him
he
immediately
thundered
against
motion
which
he
described
as
a
manoeuvre
of
the
aristocrats
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
it
it
would
be
necessary
to
begin
over
again
then
he
enquired
about
regimbart
and
some
others
who
were
also
well
known
such
as
masselin
sanson
lecornu
maréchal
and
a
certain
deslauriers
who
had
been
implicated
in
the
case
of
the
carbines
lately
intercepted
at
troyes
all
this
was
new
to
frederick
compain
knew
nothing
more
about
the
subject
he
quitted
the
young
man
with
these
words
you
come
soon
will
you
not
for
you
belong
to
it
to
what
the
calf
head
what
calf
head
ha
you
rogue
returned
compain
giving
him
a
tap
on
the
stomach
and
the
two
terrorists
plunged
into
a
café
ten
minutes
later
frederick
was
no
longer
thinking
of
deslauriers
he
was
on
the
footpath
of
the
rue
de
paradis
in
front
of
a
house
and
he
was
staring
at
the
light
which
came
from
a
lamp
in
the
second
floor
behind
a
curtain
at
length
he
ascended
the
stairs
is
arnoux
there
the
chambermaid
answered
no
but
come
in
all
the
same
and
abruptly
opening
a
door
madame
it
is
monsieur
moreau
she
arose
whiter
than
the
collar
round
her
neck
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honour
of
a
visit
so
unexpected
nothing
the
pleasure
of
seeing
old
friends
once
more
and
as
he
took
a
seat
how
is
the
worthy
arnoux
going
on
very
well
he
has
gone
out
ah
i
understand
still
following
his
old
nightly
practices
a
little
distraction
and
why
not
after
a
day
spent
in
making
calculations
the
head
needs
a
rest
she
even
praised
her
husband
as
a
man
frederick
was
irritated
at
hearing
this
eulogy
and
pointing
towards
a
piece
of
black
cloth
with
a
narrow
blue
braid
which
lay
on
her
lap
what
is
it
you
are
doing
there
a
jacket
which
i
am
trimming
for
my
daughter
now
that
you
remind
me
of
it
i
have
not
seen
her
where
is
she
pray
at
a
was
madame
arnoux
reply
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
held
them
back
while
she
rapidly
plied
her
needle
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
he
took
up
a
number
of
which
had
been
lying
on
the
table
close
to
where
she
sat
these
caricatures
of
cham
are
very
funny
are
they
not
yes
then
they
relapsed
into
silence
once
more
all
of
a
sudden
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
shook
the
what
weather
said
frederick
it
was
very
good
of
you
indeed
to
come
here
in
the
midst
of
this
dreadful
rain
oh
what
do
i
care
about
that
i
not
like
those
whom
it
prevents
no
doubt
from
going
to
keep
their
appointments
what
appointments
she
asked
with
an
ingenuous
air
do
you
remember
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
and
she
hung
down
her
head
he
gently
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
i
assure
you
that
you
have
given
me
great
pain
she
replied
with
a
sort
of
wail
in
her
voice
but
i
was
frightened
about
my
child
she
told
him
about
eugène
illness
and
all
the
tortures
which
she
had
endured
on
that
day
thanks
thanks
i
doubt
you
no
longer
i
love
you
as
much
as
ever
ah
no
it
is
not
true
why
so
she
glanced
at
him
coldly
you
forget
the
other
the
one
you
took
with
you
to
the
races
the
woman
whose
portrait
you
have
your
mistress
well
yes
exclaimed
frederick
i
do
deny
anything
i
am
a
wretch
just
listen
to
me
if
he
had
done
this
it
was
through
despair
as
one
commits
suicide
however
he
had
made
her
very
unhappy
in
order
to
avenge
himself
on
her
with
his
own
shame
what
mental
anguish
do
you
not
realise
what
it
means
madame
arnoux
turned
away
her
beautiful
face
while
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
they
closed
their
eyes
absorbed
in
a
kind
of
intoxication
that
was
like
a
sweet
ceaseless
rocking
then
they
stood
face
to
face
gazing
at
one
another
could
you
believe
it
possible
that
i
no
longer
loved
you
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
full
of
caressing
tenderness
no
in
spite
of
everything
i
felt
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
it
was
impossible
and
that
one
day
the
obstacle
between
us
two
would
disappear
so
did
i
and
i
was
dying
to
see
you
again
i
once
passed
close
to
you
in
the
did
you
really
and
he
spoke
to
her
of
the
happiness
he
experienced
at
coming
across
her
again
at
the
dambreuses
house
but
how
i
hated
you
that
evening
as
i
was
leaving
the
place
poor
boy
my
life
is
so
sad
and
mine
too
if
it
were
only
the
vexations
the
anxieties
the
humiliations
all
that
i
endure
as
wife
and
as
mother
seeing
that
one
must
die
i
would
not
complain
the
frightful
part
of
it
is
my
solitude
without
anyone
but
you
have
me
here
with
you
oh
yes
a
sob
of
deep
emotion
made
her
bosom
swell
she
spread
out
her
arms
and
they
strained
one
another
while
their
lips
met
in
a
long
kiss
a
creaking
sound
on
the
floor
not
far
from
them
reached
their
ears
there
was
a
woman
standing
close
to
them
it
was
rosanette
madame
arnoux
had
recognised
her
her
eyes
opened
to
their
widest
scanned
this
woman
full
of
astonishment
and
indignation
at
length
rosanette
said
to
her
i
have
come
to
see
monsieur
arnoux
about
a
matter
of
business
you
see
he
is
not
here
ah
that
true
returned
the
maréchale
your
nurse
is
right
a
thousand
apologies
and
turning
towards
frederick
so
here
you
are
you
the
familiar
tone
in
which
she
addressed
him
and
in
her
own
presence
too
made
madame
arnoux
flush
as
if
she
had
received
a
slap
right
across
the
face
i
tell
you
again
he
is
not
here
then
the
maréchale
who
was
looking
this
way
and
that
said
quietly
let
us
go
back
together
i
have
a
cab
waiting
below
he
pretended
not
to
hear
come
let
us
go
ah
yes
this
is
a
good
opportunity
go
go
said
madame
arnoux
they
went
off
together
and
she
stooped
over
the
head
of
the
stairs
in
order
to
see
them
once
more
and
a
laugh
piercing
reached
them
from
the
place
where
she
stood
frederick
pushed
rosanette
into
the
cab
sat
down
opposite
her
and
during
the
entire
drive
did
not
utter
a
word
the
infamy
which
it
outraged
him
to
see
once
more
flowing
back
on
him
had
been
brought
about
by
himself
alone
he
experienced
at
the
same
time
the
dishonour
of
a
crushing
humiliation
and
the
regret
caused
by
the
loss
of
his
happiness
just
when
at
last
he
had
it
in
his
grasp
it
had
for
ever
more
become
impossible
and
that
through
the
fault
of
this
girl
of
the
town
this
harlot
he
would
have
liked
to
strangle
her
he
was
choking
with
rage
when
they
had
got
into
the
house
he
flung
his
hat
on
a
piece
of
furniture
and
tore
off
his
cravat
ha
you
have
just
done
a
nice
thing
confess
it
she
planted
herself
boldly
in
front
of
him
ah
well
what
of
that
where
the
harm
what
you
are
playing
the
spy
on
me
is
that
my
fault
why
do
you
go
to
amuse
yourself
with
virtuous
women
never
mind
i
do
wish
you
to
insult
them
how
have
i
insulted
them
he
had
no
answer
to
make
to
this
and
in
a
more
spiteful
tone
but
on
the
other
occasion
at
the
champ
de
mars
ah
you
bore
us
to
death
with
your
old
women
wretch
he
raised
his
fist
do
kill
me
i
pregnant
frederick
staggered
back
you
are
lying
why
just
look
at
me
she
seized
a
candlestick
and
pointing
at
her
face
do
you
recognise
the
fact
there
little
yellow
spots
dotted
her
skin
which
was
strangely
swollen
frederick
did
not
deny
the
evidence
he
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
sank
into
an
armchair
this
event
was
a
calamity
which
in
the
first
place
put
off
their
rupture
and
in
the
next
place
upset
all
his
plans
the
notion
of
being
a
father
moreover
appeared
to
him
grotesque
inadmissible
but
why
if
in
place
of
the
maréchale
and
his
reverie
became
so
deep
that
he
had
a
kind
of
hallucination
he
saw
there
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
a
little
girl
she
resembled
madame
arnoux
and
himself
a
little
dark
and
yet
fair
with
two
black
eyes
very
large
eyebrows
and
a
red
ribbon
in
her
curling
hair
oh
how
he
would
have
loved
her
and
he
seemed
to
hear
her
voice
saying
papa
papa
rosanette
who
had
just
undressed
herself
came
across
to
him
and
noticing
a
tear
in
his
eyelids
kissed
him
gravely
on
the
forehead
he
arose
saying
by
jove
we
must
kill
this
little
one
then
she
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
be
sure
it
would
be
a
boy
and
its
name
would
be
frederick
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
begin
making
its
clothes
and
seeing
her
so
happy
a
feeling
of
pity
for
her
took
possession
of
him
as
he
no
longer
cherished
any
anger
against
her
he
desired
to
know
the
explanation
of
the
step
she
had
recently
taken
she
said
it
was
because
mademoiselle
vatnaz
had
sent
her
that
day
a
bill
which
had
been
protested
for
some
time
past
and
so
she
hastened
to
arnoux
to
get
the
money
from
him
i
have
given
it
to
you
said
frederick
it
is
a
simpler
course
for
me
to
get
over
there
what
belongs
to
me
and
to
pay
back
to
the
other
one
her
thousand
francs
is
this
really
all
you
owe
her
she
answered
certainly
on
the
following
day
at
nine
in
the
evening
the
hour
specified
by
the
doorkeeper
frederick
repaired
to
mademoiselle
residence
in
the
anteroom
he
jostled
against
the
furniture
which
was
heaped
together
but
the
sound
of
voices
and
of
music
guided
him
he
opened
a
door
and
tumbled
into
the
middle
of
a
rout
standing
up
before
a
piano
which
a
young
lady
in
spectacles
was
fingering
delmar
as
serious
as
a
pontiff
was
declaiming
a
humanitarian
poem
on
prostitution
and
his
hollow
voice
rolled
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
metallic
chords
a
row
of
women
sat
close
to
the
wall
attired
as
a
rule
in
dark
colours
without
or
sleeves
five
or
six
men
all
people
of
culture
occupied
seats
here
and
there
in
an
armchair
was
seated
a
former
writer
of
fables
a
mere
wreck
now
and
the
pungent
odour
of
the
two
lamps
was
intermingled
with
the
aroma
of
the
chocolate
which
filled
a
number
of
bowls
placed
on
the
mademoiselle
vatnaz
with
an
oriental
shawl
thrown
over
her
shoulders
sat
at
one
side
of
the
dussardier
sat
facing
her
at
the
other
side
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
in
an
embarrassing
position
besides
he
was
rather
intimidated
by
his
artistic
surroundings
had
the
vatnaz
then
broken
off
with
delmar
perhaps
not
however
she
seemed
jealous
of
the
worthy
shopman
and
frederick
having
asked
to
let
him
exchange
a
word
with
her
she
made
a
sign
to
him
to
go
with
them
into
her
own
apartment
when
the
thousand
francs
were
paid
down
before
her
she
asked
in
addition
for
interest
is
worth
while
said
dussardier
pray
hold
your
tongue
this
want
of
moral
courage
on
the
part
of
so
brave
a
man
was
agreeable
to
frederick
as
a
justification
of
his
own
conduct
he
took
away
the
bill
with
him
and
never
again
referred
to
the
scandal
at
madame
arnoux
house
but
from
that
time
forth
he
saw
clearly
all
the
defects
in
the
maréchale
character
she
possessed
incurable
bad
taste
incomprehensible
laziness
the
ignorance
of
a
savage
so
much
so
that
she
regarded
doctor
derogis
as
a
person
of
great
celebrity
and
she
felt
proud
of
entertaining
himself
and
his
wife
because
they
were
married
people
she
lectured
with
a
pedantic
air
on
the
affairs
of
daily
life
to
mademoiselle
irma
a
poor
little
creature
endowed
with
a
little
voice
who
had
as
a
protector
a
gentleman
very
well
off
an
in
the
who
had
a
rare
talent
for
card
tricks
rosanette
used
to
call
him
my
big
loulou
frederick
could
no
longer
endure
the
repetition
of
her
stupid
words
such
as
some
custard
to
chaillot
one
could
never
know
etc
and
she
persisted
in
wiping
off
the
dust
in
the
morning
from
her
trinkets
with
a
pair
of
old
white
gloves
he
was
above
all
disgusted
by
her
treatment
of
her
servant
whose
wages
were
constantly
in
arrear
and
who
even
lent
her
money
on
the
days
when
they
settled
their
accounts
they
used
to
wrangle
like
two
and
then
on
becoming
reconciled
used
to
embrace
each
other
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
madame
dambreuse
evening
parties
began
again
there
at
any
rate
he
found
something
to
amuse
him
she
was
well
versed
in
the
intrigues
of
society
the
changes
of
ambassadors
the
personal
character
of
dressmakers
and
if
commonplaces
escaped
her
lips
they
did
so
in
such
a
becoming
fashion
that
her
language
might
be
regarded
as
the
expression
of
respect
for
propriety
or
of
polite
irony
it
was
worth
while
to
watch
the
way
in
which
in
the
midst
of
twenty
persons
chatting
around
her
she
would
without
overlooking
any
of
them
bring
about
the
answers
she
desired
and
avoid
those
that
were
dangerous
things
of
a
very
simple
nature
when
related
by
her
assumed
the
aspect
of
confidences
her
slightest
smile
gave
rise
to
dreams
in
short
her
charm
like
the
exquisite
scent
which
she
usually
carried
about
with
her
was
complex
and
indefinable
while
he
was
with
her
frederick
experienced
on
each
occasion
the
pleasure
of
a
new
discovery
and
nevertheless
he
always
found
her
equally
serene
the
next
time
they
met
like
the
reflection
of
limpid
waters
but
why
was
there
such
coldness
in
her
manner
towards
her
niece
at
times
she
even
darted
strange
looks
at
her
as
soon
as
the
question
of
marriage
was
started
she
had
urged
as
an
objection
to
it
when
discussing
the
matter
with
dambreuse
the
state
of
the
dear
child
health
and
had
at
once
taken
her
off
to
the
baths
of
balaruc
on
her
return
fresh
pretexts
were
raised
by
her
that
the
young
man
was
not
in
a
good
position
that
this
ardent
passion
did
not
appear
to
be
a
very
serious
attachment
and
that
no
risk
would
be
run
by
waiting
martinon
had
replied
when
the
suggestion
was
made
to
him
that
he
would
wait
his
conduct
was
sublime
he
lectured
frederick
he
did
more
he
enlightened
him
as
to
the
best
means
of
pleasing
madame
dambreuse
even
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
had
ascertained
from
the
niece
the
sentiments
of
her
aunt
as
for
dambreuse
far
from
exhibiting
jealousy
he
treated
his
young
friend
with
the
utmost
attention
consulted
him
about
different
things
and
even
showed
anxiety
about
his
future
so
that
one
day
when
they
were
talking
about
père
roque
he
whispered
with
a
sly
air
you
have
done
well
and
cécile
miss
john
the
servants
and
the
porter
every
one
of
them
exercised
a
fascination
over
him
in
this
house
he
came
there
every
evening
quitting
rosanette
for
that
purpose
her
approaching
maternity
rendered
her
graver
in
manner
and
even
a
little
melancholy
as
if
she
were
tortured
by
anxieties
to
every
question
put
to
her
she
replied
you
are
mistaken
i
am
quite
well
she
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
signed
five
notes
in
her
previous
transactions
and
not
having
the
courage
to
tell
frederick
after
the
first
had
been
paid
she
had
gone
back
to
the
abode
of
arnoux
who
had
promised
her
in
writing
the
third
part
of
his
profits
in
the
lighting
of
the
towns
of
languedoc
by
gas
a
marvellous
undertaking
while
requesting
her
not
to
make
use
of
this
letter
at
the
meeting
of
shareholders
the
meeting
was
put
off
from
week
to
week
meanwhile
the
maréchale
wanted
money
she
would
have
died
sooner
than
ask
frederick
for
any
she
did
not
wish
to
get
it
from
him
it
would
have
spoiled
their
love
he
contributed
a
great
deal
to
the
household
expenses
but
a
little
carriage
which
he
hired
by
the
month
and
other
sacrifices
which
were
indispensable
since
he
had
begun
to
visit
the
dambreuses
prevented
him
from
doing
more
for
his
mistress
on
two
or
three
occasions
when
he
came
back
to
the
house
at
a
different
hour
from
his
usual
time
he
fancied
he
could
see
men
backs
disappearing
behind
the
door
and
she
often
went
out
without
wishing
to
state
where
she
was
going
frederick
did
not
attempt
to
enquire
minutely
into
these
matters
one
of
these
days
he
would
make
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
course
of
action
he
dreamed
of
another
life
which
would
be
more
amusing
and
more
noble
it
was
the
fact
that
he
had
such
an
ideal
before
his
mind
that
rendered
him
indulgent
towards
the
dambreuse
mansion
it
was
an
establishment
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
rue
de
poitiers
there
he
met
the
great
the
illustrious
the
profound
the
eloquent
the
immense
the
old
terrors
of
the
left
centre
the
paladins
of
the
right
the
burgraves
of
the
golden
mean
the
eternal
good
old
men
of
the
comedy
he
was
astonished
at
their
abominable
style
of
talking
their
meannesses
their
rancours
their
dishonesty
all
these
personages
after
voting
for
the
constitution
now
striving
to
destroy
it
and
they
got
into
a
state
of
great
agitation
and
launched
forth
manifestoes
pamphlets
and
biographies
hussonnet
biography
of
fumichon
was
a
masterpiece
nonancourt
devoted
himself
to
the
work
of
propagandism
in
the
country
districts
de
grémonville
worked
up
the
clergy
and
martinon
brought
together
the
young
men
of
the
wealthy
class
each
exerted
himself
according
to
his
resources
including
cisy
himself
with
his
thoughts
now
all
day
long
absorbed
in
matters
of
grave
moment
he
kept
making
excursions
here
and
there
in
a
cab
in
the
interests
of
the
party
dambreuse
like
a
barometer
constantly
gave
expression
to
its
latest
variation
lamartine
could
not
be
alluded
to
without
eliciting
from
this
gentleman
the
quotation
of
a
famous
phrase
of
the
man
of
the
people
enough
of
poetry
cavaignac
was
from
this
time
forth
nothing
better
in
his
eyes
than
a
traitor
the
president
whom
he
had
admired
for
a
period
of
three
months
was
beginning
to
fall
off
in
his
esteem
as
he
did
not
appear
to
exhibit
the
necessary
energy
and
as
he
always
wanted
a
savior
his
gratitude
since
the
affair
of
the
conservatoire
belonged
to
changarnier
thank
god
for
changarnier
let
us
place
our
reliance
on
changarnier
oh
there
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
changarnier
thiers
was
praised
above
all
for
his
volume
against
socialism
in
which
he
showed
that
he
was
quite
as
much
of
a
thinker
as
a
writer
there
was
an
immense
laugh
at
pierre
leroux
who
had
quoted
passages
from
the
philosophers
in
the
chamber
jokes
were
made
about
the
phalansterian
tail
the
market
of
ideas
came
in
for
a
meed
of
applause
and
its
authors
were
compared
to
aristophanes
frederick
patronised
the
work
as
well
as
the
rest
political
verbiage
and
good
living
had
an
enervating
effect
on
his
morality
mediocre
in
capacity
as
these
persons
appeared
to
him
he
felt
proud
of
knowing
them
and
internally
longed
for
the
respectability
that
attached
to
a
wealthy
citizen
a
mistress
like
madame
dambreuse
would
give
him
a
position
he
set
about
taking
the
necessary
steps
for
achieving
that
object
he
made
it
his
business
to
cross
her
path
did
not
fail
to
go
and
greet
her
with
a
bow
in
her
box
at
the
theatre
and
being
aware
of
the
hours
when
she
went
to
church
he
would
plant
himself
behind
a
pillar
in
a
melancholy
attitude
there
was
a
continual
interchange
of
little
notes
between
them
with
regard
to
curiosities
to
which
they
drew
each
attention
preparations
for
a
concert
or
the
borrowing
of
books
or
reviews
in
addition
to
his
visit
each
night
he
sometimes
made
a
call
just
as
the
day
was
closing
and
he
experienced
a
progressive
succession
of
pleasures
in
passing
through
the
large
front
entrance
through
the
courtyard
through
the
anteroom
and
through
the
two
finally
he
reached
her
boudoir
which
was
as
quiet
as
a
tomb
as
warm
as
an
alcove
and
in
which
one
jostled
against
the
upholstered
edging
of
furniture
in
the
midst
of
objects
of
every
sort
placed
here
and
there
chiffoniers
screens
bowls
and
trays
made
of
lacquer
or
shell
or
ivory
or
malachite
expensive
trifles
to
which
fresh
additions
were
frequently
made
amongst
single
specimens
of
these
rarities
might
be
noticed
three
etretat
rollers
which
were
used
as
and
a
frisian
cap
hung
from
a
chinese
nevertheless
there
was
a
harmony
between
all
these
things
and
one
was
even
impressed
by
the
noble
aspect
of
the
entire
place
which
was
no
doubt
due
to
the
loftiness
of
the
ceiling
the
richness
of
the
portières
and
the
long
silk
fringes
that
floated
over
the
gold
legs
of
the
stools
she
nearly
always
sat
on
a
little
sofa
close
to
the
which
garnished
the
recess
of
the
window
frederick
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
large
wheeled
ottoman
addressed
to
her
compliments
of
the
most
appropriate
kind
that
he
could
conceive
and
she
looked
at
him
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
a
smile
playing
round
her
mouth
he
read
for
her
pieces
of
poetry
into
which
he
threw
his
whole
soul
in
order
to
move
her
and
excite
her
admiration
she
would
now
and
then
interrupt
him
with
a
disparaging
remark
or
a
practical
observation
and
their
conversation
relapsed
incessantly
into
the
eternal
question
of
love
they
discussed
with
each
other
what
were
the
circumstances
that
produced
it
whether
women
felt
it
more
than
men
and
what
was
the
difference
between
them
on
that
point
frederick
tried
to
express
his
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
anything
like
coarseness
or
insipidity
this
became
at
length
a
species
of
contest
between
them
sometimes
agreeable
and
at
other
times
tedious
whilst
at
her
side
he
did
not
experience
that
ravishment
of
his
entire
being
which
drew
him
towards
madame
arnoux
nor
the
feeling
of
voluptuous
delight
with
which
rosanette
had
at
first
inspired
him
but
he
felt
a
passion
for
her
as
a
thing
that
was
abnormal
and
difficult
of
attainment
because
she
was
of
aristocratic
rank
because
she
was
wealthy
because
she
was
a
devotee
imagining
that
she
had
a
delicacy
of
sentiment
as
rare
as
the
lace
she
wore
together
with
amulets
on
her
skin
and
modest
instincts
even
in
her
depravity
he
made
a
certain
use
of
his
old
passion
for
madame
arnoux
uttering
in
his
new
flame
hearing
all
those
amorous
sentiments
which
the
other
had
caused
him
to
feel
in
downright
earnest
and
pretending
that
it
was
madame
dambreuse
herself
who
had
occasioned
them
she
received
these
avowals
like
one
accustomed
to
such
things
and
without
giving
him
a
formal
repulse
did
not
yield
in
the
slightest
degree
and
he
came
no
nearer
to
seducing
her
than
martinon
did
to
getting
married
in
order
to
bring
matters
to
an
end
with
her
niece
suitor
she
accused
him
of
having
money
for
his
object
and
even
begged
of
her
husband
to
put
the
matter
to
the
test
dambreuse
then
declared
to
the
young
man
that
cécile
being
the
orphan
child
of
poor
parents
had
neither
expectations
nor
a
dowry
martinon
not
believing
that
this
was
true
or
feeling
that
he
had
gone
too
far
to
draw
back
or
through
one
of
those
outbursts
of
idiotic
infatuation
which
may
be
described
as
acts
of
genius
replied
that
his
patrimony
amounting
to
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
would
be
sufficient
for
them
the
banker
was
touched
by
this
unexpected
display
of
disinterestedness
he
promised
the
young
man
a
undertaking
to
obtain
the
post
for
him
and
in
the
month
of
may
martinon
married
mademoiselle
cécile
there
was
no
ball
to
celebrate
the
event
the
young
people
started
the
same
evening
for
italy
frederick
came
next
day
to
pay
a
visit
to
madame
dambreuse
she
appeared
to
him
paler
than
usual
she
sharply
contradicted
him
about
two
or
three
matters
of
no
importance
however
she
went
on
to
observe
all
men
were
egoists
there
were
however
some
devoted
men
though
he
might
happen
himself
to
be
the
only
one
pooh
pooh
you
just
like
the
rest
of
them
her
eyelids
were
red
she
had
been
weeping
then
forcing
a
smile
pardon
me
i
am
in
the
wrong
sad
thoughts
have
taken
possession
of
my
mind
he
could
not
understand
what
she
meant
to
convey
by
the
last
words
no
matter
she
is
not
so
hard
to
overcome
as
i
imagined
he
thought
she
rang
for
a
glass
of
water
drank
a
mouthful
of
it
sent
it
away
again
and
then
began
to
complain
of
the
wretched
way
in
which
her
servants
attended
on
her
in
order
to
amuse
her
he
offered
to
become
her
servant
himself
pretending
that
he
knew
how
to
hand
round
plates
dust
furniture
and
announce
visitors
in
fact
to
do
the
duties
of
a
or
rather
of
a
although
the
latter
was
now
out
of
fashion
he
would
have
liked
to
cling
on
behind
her
carriage
with
a
hat
adorned
with
cock
feathers
and
how
i
would
follow
you
with
majestic
stride
carrying
your
pug
on
my
arm
you
are
facetious
said
madame
dambreuse
was
it
not
a
piece
of
folly
he
returned
to
take
everything
seriously
there
were
enough
of
miseries
in
the
world
without
creating
fresh
ones
nothing
was
worth
the
cost
of
a
single
pang
madame
dambreuse
raised
her
eyelids
with
a
sort
of
vague
approval
this
agreement
in
their
views
of
life
impelled
frederick
to
take
a
bolder
course
his
former
miscalculations
now
gave
him
insight
he
went
on
our
grandsires
lived
better
why
not
obey
the
impulse
that
urges
us
onward
after
all
love
was
not
a
thing
of
such
importance
in
itself
but
what
you
have
just
said
is
immoral
she
had
resumed
her
seat
on
the
little
sofa
he
sat
down
at
the
side
of
it
near
her
feet
do
you
see
that
i
am
lying
for
in
order
to
please
women
one
must
exhibit
the
thoughtlessness
of
a
buffoon
or
all
the
wild
passion
of
tragedy
they
only
laugh
at
us
when
we
simply
tell
them
that
we
love
them
for
my
part
i
consider
those
hyperbolical
phrases
which
tickle
their
fancy
a
profanation
of
true
love
so
that
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
give
expression
to
it
especially
when
addressing
women
who
possess
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
she
gazed
at
him
from
under
her
drooping
eyelids
he
lowered
his
voice
while
he
bent
his
head
closer
to
her
face
yes
you
frighten
me
perhaps
i
am
offending
you
forgive
me
i
did
not
intend
to
say
all
that
i
have
said
is
not
my
fault
you
are
so
beautiful
madame
dambreuse
closed
her
eyes
and
he
was
astonished
at
his
easy
victory
the
tall
trees
in
the
clouds
streaked
the
sky
with
long
strips
of
red
and
on
every
side
there
seemed
to
be
a
suspension
of
vital
movements
then
he
recalled
to
mind
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
evenings
just
the
same
as
this
filled
with
the
same
unbroken
silence
where
was
it
that
he
had
known
them
he
sank
upon
his
knees
seized
her
hand
and
swore
that
he
would
love
her
for
ever
then
as
he
was
leaving
her
she
beckoned
to
him
to
come
back
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
come
and
dine
with
us
we
be
all
alone
it
seemed
to
frederick
as
he
descended
the
stairs
that
he
had
become
a
different
man
that
he
was
surrounded
by
the
balmy
temperature
of
and
that
he
was
beyond
all
question
entering
into
the
higher
sphere
of
patrician
adulteries
and
lofty
intrigues
in
order
to
occupy
the
first
rank
there
all
he
required
was
a
woman
of
this
stamp
greedy
no
doubt
of
power
and
of
success
and
married
to
a
man
of
inferior
calibre
for
whom
she
had
done
prodigious
services
she
longed
for
some
one
of
ability
in
order
to
be
his
guide
nothing
was
impossible
now
he
felt
himself
capable
of
riding
two
hundred
leagues
on
horseback
of
travelling
for
several
nights
in
succession
without
fatigue
his
heart
overflowed
with
pride
just
in
front
of
him
on
the
footpath
a
man
wrapped
in
a
seedy
overcoat
was
walking
with
downcast
eyes
and
with
such
an
air
of
dejection
that
frederick
as
he
passed
turned
aside
to
have
a
better
look
at
him
the
other
raised
his
head
it
was
deslauriers
he
hesitated
frederick
fell
upon
his
neck
ah
my
poor
old
friend
what
is
you
and
he
dragged
deslauriers
into
his
house
at
the
same
time
asking
his
friend
a
heap
of
questions
commenced
by
describing
the
tortures
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
as
he
preached
fraternity
to
the
conservatives
and
respect
for
the
laws
to
the
socialists
the
former
tried
to
shoot
him
and
the
latter
brought
cords
to
hang
him
with
after
june
he
had
been
brutally
dismissed
he
found
himself
involved
in
a
charge
of
conspiracy
that
which
was
connected
with
the
seizure
of
arms
at
troyes
he
had
subsequently
been
released
for
want
of
evidence
to
sustain
the
charge
then
the
acting
committee
had
sent
him
to
london
where
his
ears
had
been
boxed
in
the
very
middle
of
a
banquet
at
which
he
and
his
colleagues
were
being
entertained
on
his
return
to
paris
why
did
you
not
call
here
then
to
see
me
you
were
always
out
your
porter
had
mysterious
airs
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
in
the
next
place
i
had
no
desire
to
reappear
before
you
in
the
character
of
a
defeated
man
he
had
knocked
at
the
portals
of
democracy
offering
to
serve
it
with
his
pen
with
his
tongue
with
all
his
energies
he
had
been
everywhere
repelled
they
had
mistrusted
him
and
he
had
sold
his
watch
his
bookcase
and
even
his
linen
it
would
be
much
better
to
be
breaking
one
back
on
the
pontoons
of
belle
isle
with
sénécal
frederick
who
had
been
fastening
his
cravat
did
not
appear
to
be
much
affected
by
this
news
ha
so
he
is
transported
this
good
sénécal
deslauriers
replied
while
he
surveyed
the
walls
with
an
envious
air
not
everybody
has
your
luck
excuse
me
said
frederick
without
noticing
the
allusion
to
his
own
circumstances
but
i
am
dining
in
the
city
we
must
get
you
something
to
eat
order
whatever
you
like
take
even
my
bed
this
cordial
reception
dissipated
deslauriers
bitterness
your
bed
but
that
might
inconvenience
you
oh
no
i
have
others
oh
all
right
returned
the
advocate
with
a
laugh
pray
where
are
you
dining
at
madame
dambreuse
can
it
be
that
you
are
perhaps
you
are
too
inquisitive
said
frederick
with
a
smile
which
confirmed
this
hypothesis
then
after
a
glance
at
the
clock
he
resumed
his
seat
that
how
it
is
and
we
must
despair
my
of
the
people
oh
pardon
me
let
others
bother
themselves
about
the
people
henceforth
the
advocate
detested
the
because
he
had
suffered
so
much
on
their
account
in
his
province
a
district
every
pit
had
appointed
a
provisional
government
from
which
he
received
orders
besides
their
conduct
has
been
everywhere
charming
at
lyons
at
lille
at
havre
at
paris
for
in
imitation
of
the
manufacturers
who
would
fain
exclude
the
products
of
the
foreigner
these
gentlemen
call
on
us
to
banish
the
english
german
belgian
and
savoyard
workmen
as
for
their
intelligence
what
was
the
use
of
that
precious
trades
union
of
theirs
which
they
established
under
the
restoration
in
they
joined
the
national
guard
without
having
the
common
sense
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
it
is
it
not
the
fact
that
since
the
morning
when
dawned
the
various
had
not
reappeared
with
their
banners
they
have
even
demanded
popular
representatives
for
themselves
who
are
not
to
open
their
lips
except
on
their
own
behalf
all
this
is
the
same
as
if
the
deputies
who
represent
beetroot
were
to
concern
themselves
about
nothing
save
beetroot
ah
i
had
enough
of
these
dodgers
who
in
turn
prostrate
themselves
before
the
scaffold
of
robespierre
the
boots
of
the
emperor
and
the
umbrella
of
louis
philippe
a
rabble
who
always
yield
allegiance
to
the
person
that
flings
bread
into
their
mouths
they
are
always
crying
out
against
the
venality
of
talleyrand
and
mirabeau
but
the
messenger
down
below
there
would
sell
his
country
for
fifty
centimes
if
they
only
promise
to
fix
a
tariff
of
three
francs
on
his
walk
ah
what
a
wretched
state
of
affairs
we
ought
to
set
the
four
corners
of
europe
on
fire
frederick
said
in
reply
the
spark
is
what
you
lack
you
were
simply
a
lot
of
shopboys
and
even
the
best
of
you
were
nothing
better
than
penniless
students
as
for
the
workmen
they
may
well
complain
for
if
you
except
a
million
taken
out
of
the
civil
list
and
of
which
you
made
a
grant
to
them
with
the
meanest
expressions
of
flattery
you
have
done
nothing
for
them
save
to
talk
in
stilted
phrases
the
workman
certificate
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
employer
and
the
person
who
is
paid
wages
remains
even
in
the
eye
of
the
law
the
inferior
of
his
master
because
his
word
is
not
believed
in
short
the
republic
seems
to
me
a
institution
who
knows
perhaps
progress
can
be
realised
only
through
an
aristocracy
or
through
a
single
man
the
initiative
always
comes
from
the
top
and
whatever
may
be
the
people
pretensions
they
are
lower
than
those
placed
over
them
that
may
be
true
said
deslauriers
according
to
frederick
the
vast
majority
of
citizens
aimed
only
at
a
life
of
peace
he
had
been
improved
by
his
visits
to
the
dambreuses
and
the
chances
were
all
on
the
side
of
the
conservatives
that
party
however
was
lacking
in
new
men
if
you
came
forward
i
am
sure
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
deslauriers
saw
what
frederick
meant
and
passed
his
two
hands
over
his
head
then
all
of
a
sudden
but
what
about
yourself
is
there
anything
to
prevent
you
from
doing
it
why
would
you
not
be
a
deputy
in
consequence
of
a
double
election
there
was
in
the
aube
a
vacancy
for
a
candidate
dambreuse
who
had
been
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
assembly
belonged
to
a
different
arrondissement
do
you
wish
me
to
interest
myself
on
your
behalf
he
was
acquainted
with
many
publicans
schoolmasters
doctors
notaries
clerks
and
their
masters
besides
you
can
make
the
peasants
believe
anything
you
like
frederick
felt
his
ambition
rekindling
deslauriers
added
you
would
find
no
trouble
in
getting
a
situation
for
me
in
paris
oh
it
would
not
be
hard
to
manage
it
through
monsieur
dambreuse
as
we
happened
to
have
been
talking
just
now
about
the
advocate
went
on
what
has
become
of
his
big
company
this
is
the
sort
of
employment
that
would
suit
me
and
i
could
make
myself
useful
to
them
while
preserving
my
own
independence
frederick
promised
that
he
would
introduce
him
to
the
banker
before
three
days
had
passed
the
dinner
which
he
enjoyed
alone
with
madame
dambreuse
was
a
delightful
affair
she
sat
facing
him
with
a
smile
on
her
countenance
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
whereon
was
placed
a
basket
of
flowers
while
a
lamp
suspended
above
their
heads
shed
its
light
on
the
scene
and
as
the
window
was
open
they
could
see
the
stars
they
talked
very
little
distrusting
themselves
no
doubt
but
the
moment
the
servants
had
turned
their
backs
they
sent
across
a
kiss
to
one
another
from
the
tips
of
their
lips
he
told
her
about
his
idea
of
becoming
a
candidate
she
approved
of
the
project
promising
even
to
get
dambreuse
to
use
every
effort
on
his
behalf
as
the
evening
advanced
some
of
her
friends
presented
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
congratulating
her
and
at
the
same
time
expressing
sympathy
with
her
she
must
be
so
much
pained
at
the
loss
of
her
niece
besides
it
was
all
very
well
for
people
to
go
on
a
trip
would
come
incumbrances
children
but
really
italy
did
not
realise
one
expectations
they
had
not
as
yet
passed
the
age
of
illusions
and
in
the
next
place
the
honeymoon
made
everything
look
beautiful
the
last
two
who
remained
behind
were
de
grémonville
and
frederick
the
diplomatist
was
not
inclined
to
leave
at
last
he
departed
at
midnight
madame
dambreuse
beckoned
to
frederick
to
go
with
him
and
thanked
him
for
this
compliance
with
her
wishes
by
giving
him
a
gentle
pressure
with
her
hand
more
delightful
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
the
maréchale
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
on
seeing
him
again
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
for
the
last
five
hours
he
gave
as
an
excuse
for
the
delay
an
indispensable
step
which
he
had
to
take
in
the
interests
of
deslauriers
his
face
wore
a
look
of
triumph
and
was
surrounded
by
an
aureola
which
dazzled
rosanette
is
perhaps
on
account
of
your
black
coat
which
fits
you
well
but
i
have
never
seen
you
look
so
handsome
how
handsome
you
are
in
a
transport
of
tenderness
she
made
a
vow
internally
never
again
to
belong
to
any
other
man
no
matter
what
might
be
the
consequence
even
if
she
were
to
die
of
want
her
pretty
eyes
sparkled
with
such
intense
passion
that
frederick
took
her
upon
his
knees
and
said
to
himself
what
a
rascally
part
i
am
playing
while
admiring
his
own
perversity
chapter
xvii
a
strange
betrothal
dambreuse
when
deslauriers
presented
himself
at
his
house
was
thinking
of
reviving
his
great
speculation
but
this
fusion
of
all
the
companies
into
one
was
looked
upon
unfavourably
there
was
an
outcry
against
monopolies
as
if
immense
capital
were
not
needed
for
carrying
out
enterprises
of
this
kind
deslauriers
who
had
read
for
the
purpose
the
work
of
gobet
and
the
articles
of
chappe
in
the
des
understood
the
question
perfectly
he
demonstrated
that
the
law
of
established
for
the
benefit
of
the
grantee
a
privilege
which
could
not
be
transferred
besides
a
democratic
colour
might
be
given
to
the
undertaking
to
interfere
with
the
formation
of
companies
was
against
the
principle
even
of
association
dambreuse
intrusted
to
him
some
notes
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
up
a
memorandum
as
for
the
way
in
which
he
meant
to
pay
for
the
work
he
was
all
the
more
profuse
in
his
promises
from
the
fact
that
they
were
not
very
definite
deslauriers
called
again
at
frederick
house
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
interview
moreover
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
madame
dambreuse
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
just
as
he
was
going
out
i
wish
you
joy
upon
my
soul
i
do
then
they
had
a
chat
about
the
election
there
was
something
to
be
devised
in
order
to
carry
it
three
days
later
deslauriers
reappeared
with
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
handwriting
intended
for
the
newspapers
and
which
was
nothing
less
than
a
friendly
letter
from
dambreuse
expressing
approval
of
their
friend
candidature
supported
by
a
conservative
and
praised
by
a
red
he
ought
to
succeed
how
was
it
that
the
capitalist
had
put
his
signature
to
such
a
lucubration
the
advocate
had
of
his
own
motion
and
without
the
least
appearance
of
embarrassment
gone
and
shown
it
to
madame
dambreuse
who
thinking
it
quite
appropriate
had
taken
the
rest
of
the
business
on
her
own
shoulders
frederick
was
astonished
at
this
proceeding
nevertheless
he
approved
of
it
then
as
deslauriers
was
to
have
an
interview
with
roque
his
friend
explained
to
him
how
he
stood
with
regard
to
louise
tell
them
anything
you
like
that
my
affairs
are
in
an
unsettled
state
that
i
am
putting
them
in
order
she
is
young
enough
to
wait
deslauriers
set
forth
and
frederick
looked
upon
himself
as
a
very
able
man
he
experienced
moreover
a
feeling
of
gratification
a
profound
satisfaction
his
delight
at
being
the
possessor
of
a
rich
woman
was
not
spoiled
by
any
contrast
the
sentiment
harmonised
with
the
surroundings
his
life
now
would
be
full
of
joy
in
every
sense
perhaps
the
most
delicious
sensation
of
all
was
to
gaze
at
madame
dambreuse
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
other
ladies
in
her
the
propriety
of
her
manners
made
him
dream
of
other
attitudes
while
she
was
talking
in
a
tone
of
coldness
he
would
recall
to
mind
the
loving
words
which
she
had
murmured
in
his
ear
all
the
respect
which
he
felt
for
her
virtue
gave
him
a
thrill
of
pleasure
as
if
it
were
a
homage
which
was
reflected
back
on
himself
and
at
times
he
felt
a
longing
to
exclaim
but
i
know
her
better
than
you
she
is
mine
it
was
not
long
ere
their
relations
came
to
be
socially
recognised
as
an
established
fact
madame
dambreuse
during
the
whole
winter
brought
frederick
with
her
into
fashionable
society
he
nearly
always
arrived
before
her
and
he
watched
her
as
she
entered
the
house
they
were
visiting
with
her
arms
uncovered
a
fan
in
her
hand
and
pearls
in
her
hair
she
would
pause
on
the
threshold
the
lintel
of
the
door
formed
a
framework
round
her
head
and
she
would
open
and
shut
her
eyes
with
a
certain
air
of
indecision
in
order
to
see
whether
he
was
there
she
drove
him
back
in
her
carriage
the
rain
lashed
the
the
seemed
merely
shadows
wavering
in
the
mire
of
the
street
and
pressed
close
to
each
other
they
observed
all
these
things
vaguely
with
a
calm
disdain
under
various
pretexts
he
would
linger
in
her
room
for
an
entire
additional
hour
it
was
chiefly
through
a
feeling
of
ennui
that
madame
dambreuse
had
yielded
but
this
latest
experience
was
not
to
be
wasted
she
desired
to
give
herself
up
to
an
absorbing
passion
and
so
she
began
to
heap
on
his
head
adulations
and
caresses
she
sent
him
flowers
she
had
an
upholstered
chair
made
for
him
she
made
presents
to
him
of
a
an
inkstand
a
thousand
little
things
for
daily
use
so
that
every
act
of
his
life
should
recall
her
to
his
memory
these
kind
attentions
charmed
him
at
first
and
in
a
little
while
appeared
to
him
very
simple
she
would
step
into
a
cab
get
rid
of
it
at
the
opening
into
a
and
come
out
at
the
other
end
and
then
gliding
along
by
the
walls
with
a
double
veil
on
her
face
she
would
reach
the
street
where
frederick
who
had
been
keeping
watch
would
take
her
arm
quickly
to
lead
her
towards
his
house
his
two
would
have
gone
out
for
a
walk
and
the
doorkeeper
would
have
been
sent
on
some
errand
she
would
throw
a
glance
around
her
nothing
to
fear
and
she
would
breathe
forth
the
sigh
of
an
exile
who
beholds
his
country
once
more
their
good
fortune
emboldened
them
their
appointments
became
more
frequent
one
evening
she
even
presented
herself
all
of
a
sudden
in
full
these
surprises
might
have
perilous
consequences
he
reproached
her
for
her
lack
of
prudence
nevertheless
he
was
not
taken
with
her
appearance
the
low
body
of
her
dress
exposed
her
thinness
too
freely
it
was
then
that
he
discovered
what
had
hitherto
been
hidden
from
him
the
disillusion
of
his
senses
none
the
less
did
he
make
professions
of
ardent
love
but
in
order
to
call
up
such
emotions
he
found
it
necessary
to
evoke
the
images
of
rosanette
and
madame
arnoux
this
sentimental
atrophy
left
his
intellect
entirely
untrammelled
and
he
was
more
ambitious
than
ever
of
attaining
a
high
position
in
society
inasmuch
as
he
had
such
a
the
very
least
he
could
do
was
to
make
use
of
it
one
morning
about
the
middle
of
january
sénécal
entered
his
study
and
in
response
to
his
exclamation
of
astonishment
announced
that
he
was
deslauriers
secretary
he
even
brought
frederick
a
letter
it
contained
good
news
and
yet
it
took
him
to
task
for
his
negligence
he
would
have
to
come
down
to
the
scene
of
action
at
once
the
future
deputy
said
he
would
set
out
on
his
way
there
in
two
days
time
sénécal
gave
no
opinion
on
the
other
merits
as
a
candidate
he
spoke
about
his
own
concerns
and
about
the
affairs
of
the
country
miserable
as
the
state
of
things
happened
to
be
it
gave
him
pleasure
for
they
were
advancing
in
the
direction
of
communism
in
the
first
place
the
administration
led
towards
it
of
its
own
accord
since
every
day
a
greater
number
of
things
were
controlled
by
the
government
as
for
property
the
constitution
of
in
spite
of
its
weaknesses
had
not
spared
it
the
state
might
in
the
name
of
public
utility
henceforth
take
whatever
it
thought
would
suit
it
sénécal
declared
himself
in
favour
of
authority
and
frederick
noticed
in
his
remarks
the
exaggeration
which
characterised
what
he
had
said
himself
to
deslauriers
the
republican
even
inveighed
against
the
masses
for
their
inadequacy
robespierre
by
upholding
the
right
of
the
minority
had
brought
louis
xvi
to
acknowledge
the
national
convention
and
saved
the
people
things
were
rendered
legitimate
by
the
end
towards
which
they
were
directed
a
dictatorship
is
sometimes
indispensable
long
live
tyranny
provided
that
the
tyrant
promotes
the
public
welfare
their
discussion
lasted
a
long
time
and
as
he
was
taking
his
departure
sénécal
confessed
perhaps
it
was
the
real
object
of
his
visit
that
deslauriers
was
getting
very
impatient
at
silence
but
dambreuse
was
frederick
saw
him
every
day
his
character
of
an
intimate
friend
enabling
him
to
obtain
admission
to
the
bedside
general
changarnier
recall
had
powerfully
affected
the
mind
he
was
on
the
evening
of
the
occurrence
seized
with
a
burning
sensation
in
his
chest
together
with
an
oppression
that
prevented
him
from
lying
down
the
application
of
leeches
gave
him
immediate
relief
the
dry
cough
disappeared
the
respiration
became
more
easy
and
eight
days
later
he
said
while
swallowing
some
broth
ah
i
better
now
but
i
was
near
going
on
the
last
long
journey
not
without
me
exclaimed
madame
dambreuse
intending
by
this
remark
to
convey
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
outlive
him
instead
of
replying
he
cast
upon
her
and
upon
her
lover
a
singular
smile
in
which
there
was
at
the
same
time
resignation
indulgence
irony
and
even
as
it
were
a
touch
of
humour
a
sort
of
secret
satisfaction
almost
amounting
to
actual
joy
frederick
wished
to
start
for
nogent
madame
dambreuse
objected
to
this
and
he
unpacked
and
his
luggage
by
turns
according
to
the
changes
in
the
invalid
condition
suddenly
dambreuse
spat
forth
considerable
blood
the
princes
of
medical
science
on
being
consulted
could
not
think
of
any
fresh
remedy
his
legs
swelled
and
his
weakness
increased
he
had
several
times
evinced
a
desire
to
see
cécile
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
france
with
her
husband
now
a
collector
of
taxes
a
position
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
a
month
ago
dambreuse
gave
express
orders
to
send
for
her
madame
dambreuse
wrote
three
letters
which
she
showed
him
without
trusting
him
even
to
the
care
of
the
nun
she
did
not
leave
him
for
one
second
and
no
longer
went
to
bed
the
ladies
who
had
their
names
entered
at
the
made
enquiries
about
her
with
feelings
of
admiration
and
the
were
filled
with
respect
on
seeing
the
quantity
of
straw
which
was
placed
in
the
street
under
the
windows
on
the
of
february
at
five
a
frightful
hæmoptysis
came
on
the
doctor
who
had
charge
of
him
pointed
out
that
the
case
had
assumed
a
dangerous
aspect
they
sent
in
hot
haste
for
a
priest
while
dambreuse
was
making
his
confession
madame
kept
gazing
curiously
at
him
some
distance
away
after
this
the
young
doctor
applied
a
blister
and
awaited
the
result
the
flame
of
the
lamps
obscured
by
some
of
the
furniture
lighted
up
the
apartment
in
an
irregular
fashion
frederick
and
madame
dambreuse
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
watched
the
dying
man
in
the
recess
of
a
window
the
priest
and
the
doctor
chatted
in
low
tones
the
good
sister
on
her
knees
kept
mumbling
prayers
at
last
came
a
rattling
in
the
throat
the
hands
grew
cold
the
face
began
to
turn
white
now
and
then
he
drew
a
deep
breath
all
of
a
sudden
but
gradually
this
became
rarer
and
rarer
two
or
three
confused
words
escaped
him
he
turned
his
eyes
upward
and
at
the
same
moment
his
respiration
became
so
feeble
that
it
was
almost
imperceptible
then
his
head
sank
on
one
side
on
the
pillow
for
a
minute
all
present
remained
motionless
madame
dambreuse
advanced
towards
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
and
without
an
effort
with
the
unaffectedness
of
one
discharging
a
duty
she
drew
down
the
eyelids
then
she
spread
out
her
two
arms
her
figure
writhing
as
if
in
a
spasm
of
repressed
despair
and
quitted
the
room
supported
by
the
physician
and
the
nun
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
frederick
made
his
way
up
to
her
apartment
there
was
in
it
an
indefinable
odour
emanating
from
some
delicate
substances
with
which
it
was
filled
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
lay
a
black
dress
which
formed
a
glaring
contrast
with
the
pink
coverlet
madame
dambreuse
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
without
attributing
to
her
any
passionate
regret
he
thought
she
looked
a
little
sad
and
in
a
mournful
voice
he
said
you
are
enduring
pain
i
no
not
at
all
as
she
turned
around
her
eyes
fell
on
the
dress
which
she
inspected
then
she
told
him
not
to
stand
on
ceremony
smoke
if
you
like
you
can
make
yourself
at
home
with
me
and
with
a
great
sigh
ah
blessed
virgin
what
a
riddance
frederick
was
astonished
at
this
exclamation
he
replied
as
he
kissed
her
hand
all
the
same
you
were
free
this
allusion
to
the
facility
with
which
the
intrigue
between
them
had
been
carried
on
hurt
madame
dambreuse
ah
you
do
know
the
services
that
i
did
for
him
or
the
misery
in
which
i
lived
what
why
certainly
was
it
a
safe
thing
to
have
always
near
him
that
bastard
a
daughter
whom
he
introduced
into
the
house
at
the
end
of
five
years
of
married
life
and
who
were
it
not
for
me
might
have
led
him
into
some
act
of
folly
then
she
explained
how
her
affairs
stood
the
arrangement
on
the
occasion
of
her
marriage
was
that
the
property
of
each
party
should
be
separate
i
the
amount
of
her
inheritance
was
three
hundred
thousand
francs
dambreuse
had
guaranteed
by
the
marriage
contract
that
in
the
event
of
her
surviving
him
she
should
have
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
together
with
the
ownership
of
the
mansion
but
a
short
time
afterwards
he
had
made
a
will
by
which
he
gave
her
all
he
possessed
and
this
she
estimated
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
ascertain
just
at
present
at
over
three
millions
frederick
opened
his
eyes
widely
i
a
marriage
may
take
place
in
france
under
the
de
by
which
the
husband
has
the
enjoyment
and
the
right
of
disposing
of
the
property
both
of
himself
and
his
wife
the
by
which
he
can
only
dispose
of
the
income
and
the
de
séparation
de
by
which
husband
and
wife
enjoy
and
exercise
control
over
their
respective
estates
translator
it
was
worth
the
trouble
was
it
however
i
contributed
to
it
it
was
my
own
property
i
was
protecting
cécile
would
have
unjustly
robbed
me
of
it
why
did
she
not
come
to
see
her
father
as
he
asked
her
this
question
madame
dambreuse
eyed
him
attentively
then
in
a
dry
tone
i
have
the
least
idea
want
of
heart
probably
oh
i
know
what
she
is
and
for
that
reason
she
wo
get
a
farthing
from
me
she
had
not
been
very
troublesome
he
pointed
out
at
any
rate
since
her
marriage
ha
her
marriage
said
madame
dambreuse
with
a
sneer
and
she
grudged
having
treated
only
too
well
this
stupid
creature
who
was
jealous
and
hypocritical
all
the
faults
of
her
father
she
disparaged
him
more
and
more
there
was
never
a
person
with
such
profound
duplicity
and
with
such
a
merciless
disposition
into
the
bargain
as
hard
as
a
stone
a
bad
man
a
bad
man
even
the
wisest
people
fall
into
errors
madame
dambreuse
had
just
made
a
serious
one
through
this
overflow
of
hatred
on
her
part
frederick
sitting
opposite
her
in
an
easy
chair
was
reflecting
deeply
scandalised
by
the
language
she
had
used
she
arose
and
knelt
down
beside
him
to
be
with
you
is
the
only
real
pleasure
you
are
the
only
one
i
love
while
she
gazed
at
him
her
heart
softened
a
nervous
reaction
brought
tears
into
her
eyes
and
she
murmured
will
you
marry
me
at
first
he
thought
he
had
not
understood
what
she
meant
he
was
stunned
by
this
wealth
she
repeated
in
a
louder
tone
will
you
marry
me
at
last
he
said
with
a
smile
have
you
any
doubt
about
it
then
the
thought
forced
itself
on
his
mind
that
his
conduct
was
infamous
and
in
order
to
make
a
kind
of
reparation
to
the
dead
man
he
offered
to
watch
by
his
side
himself
but
feeling
ashamed
of
this
pious
sentiment
he
added
in
a
flippant
tone
it
would
be
perhaps
more
seemly
perhaps
so
indeed
she
said
on
account
of
the
servants
the
bed
had
been
drawn
completely
out
of
the
alcove
the
nun
was
near
the
foot
of
it
and
at
the
head
of
it
sat
a
priest
a
different
one
a
tall
spare
man
with
the
look
of
a
fanatical
spaniard
on
the
covered
with
a
white
cloth
three
were
burning
frederick
took
a
chair
and
gazed
at
the
corpse
the
face
was
as
yellow
as
straw
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
there
were
traces
of
foam
a
silk
handkerchief
was
tied
around
the
skull
and
on
the
breast
covered
with
a
knitted
waistcoat
lay
a
silver
crucifix
between
the
two
crossed
hands
it
was
over
this
life
full
of
anxieties
how
many
journeys
had
he
not
made
to
various
places
how
many
rows
of
figures
had
he
not
piled
together
how
many
speculations
had
he
not
hatched
how
many
reports
had
he
not
heard
read
what
quackeries
what
smiles
and
curvets
for
he
had
acclaimed
napoléon
the
cossacks
louis
the
every
loving
power
so
dearly
that
he
would
have
paid
in
order
to
have
the
opportunity
of
selling
himself
but
he
had
left
behind
him
the
estate
of
la
fortelle
three
factories
in
picardy
the
woods
of
crancé
in
the
yonne
a
farm
near
orléans
and
a
great
deal
of
personal
property
in
the
form
of
bills
and
papers
frederick
thus
made
an
estimate
of
her
fortune
and
it
would
soon
nevertheless
belong
to
him
first
of
all
he
thought
of
what
people
would
say
then
he
asked
himself
what
present
he
ought
to
make
to
his
mother
and
he
was
concerned
about
his
future
equipages
and
about
employing
an
old
coachman
belonging
to
his
own
family
as
the
doorkeeper
of
course
the
livery
would
not
be
the
same
he
would
convert
the
large
into
his
own
study
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
by
knocking
down
three
walls
from
setting
up
a
on
the
perhaps
there
might
be
an
opportunity
for
introducing
into
the
lower
portion
of
the
house
a
hall
for
turkish
baths
as
for
dambreuse
office
a
disagreeable
spot
what
use
could
he
make
of
it
these
reflections
were
from
time
to
time
rudely
interrupted
by
the
sounds
made
by
the
priest
in
blowing
his
nose
or
by
the
good
sister
in
settling
the
fire
but
the
actual
facts
showed
that
his
thoughts
rested
on
a
solid
foundation
the
corpse
was
there
the
eyelids
had
reopened
and
the
pupils
although
steeped
in
clammy
gloom
had
an
enigmatic
intolerable
expression
frederick
fancied
that
he
saw
there
a
judgment
directed
against
himself
and
he
felt
almost
a
sort
of
remorse
for
he
had
never
any
complaint
to
make
against
this
man
who
on
the
contrary
come
now
an
old
wretch
and
he
looked
at
the
dead
man
more
closely
in
order
to
strengthen
his
mind
mentally
addressing
him
thus
well
what
have
i
killed
you
meanwhile
the
priest
read
his
breviary
the
nun
who
sat
motionless
had
fallen
asleep
the
wicks
of
the
three
had
grown
longer
for
two
hours
could
be
heard
the
heavy
rolling
of
carts
making
their
way
to
the
markets
the
began
to
admit
streaks
of
white
a
cab
passed
then
a
group
of
donkeys
went
trotting
over
the
pavement
then
came
strokes
of
hammers
cries
of
itinerant
vendors
of
wood
and
blasts
of
horns
already
every
other
sound
was
blended
with
the
great
voice
of
awakening
paris
frederick
went
out
to
perform
the
duties
assigned
to
him
he
first
repaired
to
the
mayor
office
to
make
the
necessary
declaration
then
when
the
medical
officer
had
given
him
a
certificate
of
death
he
called
a
second
time
at
the
municipal
buildings
in
order
to
name
the
cemetery
which
the
family
had
selected
and
to
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
ceremonies
the
clerk
in
the
office
showed
him
a
plan
which
indicated
the
mode
of
interment
adopted
for
the
various
classes
and
a
programme
giving
full
particulars
with
regard
to
the
spectacular
portion
of
the
funeral
would
he
like
to
have
an
open
or
a
hearse
with
plumes
plaits
on
the
horses
and
aigrettes
on
the
footmen
initials
or
a
a
man
to
display
the
family
distinctions
and
what
number
of
carriages
would
he
require
frederick
did
not
economise
in
the
slightest
degree
madame
dambreuse
was
determined
to
spare
no
expense
after
this
he
made
his
way
to
the
church
the
curate
who
had
charge
of
burials
found
fault
with
the
waste
of
money
on
funeral
pomps
for
instance
the
officer
for
the
display
of
armorial
distinctions
was
really
useless
it
would
be
far
better
to
have
a
goodly
display
of
a
low
mass
accompanied
by
music
would
be
appropriate
frederick
gave
written
directions
to
have
everything
that
was
agreed
upon
carried
out
with
a
joint
undertaking
to
defray
all
the
expenses
he
went
next
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
to
purchase
a
piece
of
ground
a
grant
of
a
piece
which
was
two
metres
in
length
and
one
in
breadth
j
cost
five
hundred
francs
did
he
want
a
grant
for
fifty
years
or
forever
oh
forever
said
frederick
he
took
the
whole
thing
seriously
and
got
into
a
state
of
intense
anxiety
about
it
in
the
courtyard
of
the
mansion
a
was
waiting
to
show
him
estimates
and
plans
of
greek
egyptian
and
moorish
tombs
but
the
family
architect
had
already
been
in
consultation
with
madame
and
on
the
table
in
the
vestibule
there
were
all
sorts
of
prospectuses
with
reference
to
the
cleaning
of
mattresses
the
disinfection
of
rooms
and
the
various
processes
of
embalming
after
dining
he
went
back
to
the
tailor
shop
to
order
mourning
for
the
servants
and
he
had
still
to
discharge
another
function
for
the
gloves
that
he
had
ordered
were
of
beaver
whereas
the
right
kind
for
a
funeral
were
when
he
arrived
next
morning
at
ten
the
large
was
filled
with
people
and
nearly
everyone
said
on
encountering
the
others
in
a
melancholy
tone
it
is
only
a
month
ago
since
i
saw
him
good
heavens
it
will
be
the
same
way
with
us
all
j
a
metre
is
about
feet
translator
yes
but
let
us
try
to
keep
it
as
far
away
from
us
as
possible
then
there
were
little
smiles
of
satisfaction
and
they
even
engaged
in
conversations
entirely
unsuited
to
the
occasion
at
length
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
in
a
black
coat
in
the
french
fashion
and
short
breeches
with
a
cloak
cambric
a
long
sword
by
his
side
and
a
hat
under
his
arm
gave
utterance
with
a
bow
to
the
customary
words
messieurs
when
it
shall
be
your
pleasure
the
funeral
started
it
was
the
for
flowers
on
the
place
de
la
madeleine
it
was
a
fine
day
with
brilliant
sunshine
and
the
breeze
which
shook
the
canvas
tents
a
little
swelled
at
the
edges
the
enormous
black
cloth
which
was
hung
over
the
the
escutcheon
of
dambreuse
which
covered
a
square
piece
of
velvet
was
repeated
there
three
times
it
was
with
an
arm
sinister
or
and
a
clenched
hand
with
a
glove
with
the
coronet
of
a
count
and
this
device
every
the
bearers
lifted
the
heavy
coffin
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
they
entered
the
building
the
six
chapels
the
hemicycles
and
the
seats
were
hung
with
black
the
catafalque
at
the
end
of
the
choir
formed
with
its
large
a
single
focus
of
yellow
lights
at
the
two
corners
over
the
candelabra
flames
of
spirits
of
wine
were
burning
the
persons
of
highest
rank
took
up
their
position
in
the
sanctuary
and
the
rest
in
the
nave
and
then
the
office
for
the
dead
began
with
the
exception
of
a
few
the
religious
ignorance
of
all
was
so
profound
that
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
had
from
time
to
time
to
make
signs
to
them
to
rise
to
kneel
or
to
resume
their
seats
the
organ
and
the
two
could
be
heard
alternately
with
the
voices
in
the
intervals
of
silence
the
only
sounds
that
reached
the
ear
were
the
mumblings
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
then
the
music
and
the
chanting
went
on
again
the
light
of
day
shone
dimly
through
the
three
cupolas
but
the
open
door
let
in
as
it
were
a
stream
of
white
radiance
which
entering
in
a
horizontal
direction
fell
on
every
uncovered
head
and
in
the
air
towards
the
ceiling
of
the
church
floated
a
shadow
which
was
penetrated
by
the
reflection
of
the
gildings
that
decorated
the
ribbing
of
the
pendentives
and
the
foliage
of
the
capitals
frederick
in
order
to
distract
his
attention
listened
to
the
he
gazed
at
those
around
him
or
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
pictures
hanging
too
far
above
his
head
wherein
the
life
of
the
magdalen
was
represented
luckily
pellerin
came
to
sit
down
beside
him
and
immediately
plunged
into
a
long
dissertation
on
the
subject
of
frescoes
the
bell
began
to
toll
they
left
the
church
the
hearse
adorned
with
hanging
draperies
and
tall
plumes
set
out
for
drawn
by
four
black
horses
with
their
manes
plaited
their
heads
decked
with
tufts
of
feathers
and
with
large
trappings
embroidered
with
silver
flowing
down
to
their
shoes
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
in
hessian

wore
a

middle
of

at
the
mournful
procession

with
their
brats
in

got
up
on

and
people
who
had
been
drinking
glasses
of
beer
in
the
cafés
presented
themselves
at
the
windows
with
in
their
hands
the
way
was
long
and
as
at
formal
meals
at
which
people
are
at
first
reserved
and
then
expansive
the
general
deportment
speedily
relaxed
they
talked
of
nothing
but
the
refusal
of
an
allowance
by
the
chamber
to
the
president

shown
himself

been
magnificent

in
short
the
entire
committee
would
be
compelled
perhaps
to
follow
the
advice
of
mm
and
dufour
this
conversation
was
continued
as
they
passed
through
the
rue
de
la
roquette
with
shops
on
each
side
in
which
could
be
seen
only
chains
of
coloured
glass
and
black
circular
tablets
covered
with
drawings
and
letters
of
gold
which
made
them
resemble
grottoes
full
of
stalactites
and
shops
but
when
they
had
reached
the
everyone
instantaneously
ceased
speaking
the
tombs
among
the

the
rays
of

sun
striking
on

made
them
scintillate
in
the
midst
of
the
black

crosses
the

advanced
along
the
broad
paths
which
are
paved

from

there
the

further
down
the
chimneys
of
then
the
entire
great
city
frederick
found
an
opportunity
of
admiring
the
scene
while
the
various
addresses
were
being
delivered
the
first
was
in
the
name
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
second
in
the
name
of
the
general
council
of
the
aube
the
third
in
the
name
of
the
company
of
the
fourth
in
the
name
of
the
agricultural
society
of
the
yonne
and
there
was
another
in
the
name
of
a
philanthropic
society
finally
just
as
everyone
was
going
away
a
stranger
began
reading
a
sixth
address
in
the
name
of
the
amiens
society
of
antiquaries
and
thereupon
they
all
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
denounce
socialism
of
which
dambreuse
had
died
a
victim
it
was
the
effect
produced
on
his
mind
by
the
exhibitions
of
anarchic
violence
together
with
his
devotion
to
order
that
had
shortened
his
days
they
praised
his
intellectual
powers
his
integrity
his
generosity
and
even
his
silence
as
a
representative
of
the
people
for
if
he
was
not
an
orator
he
possessed
instead
those
solid
qualities
a
thousand
times
more
useful
with
all
the
requisite
phrases
premature
end
eternal
regrets
the
better
land
farewell
or
rather
no
revoir
the
clay
mingled
with
stones
fell
on
the
coffin
and
he
would
never
again
be
a
subject
for
discussion
in
society
however
there
were
a
few
allusions
to
him
as
the
persons
who
had
followed
his
remains
left
the
cemetery
hussonnet
who
would
have
to
give
an
account
of
the
interment
in
the
newspapers
took
up
all
the
addresses
in
a
chaffing
style
for
in
truth
the
worthy
dambreuse
had
been
one
of
the
most
notable
k
of
the
last
reign
then
the
citizens
were
driven
in
the
to
their
various
places
of
business
the
ceremony
had
not
lasted
very
long
they
congratulated
themselves
on
the
circumstance
frederick
returned
to
his
own
abode
quite
worn
out
k
the
reader
will
excuse
this
barbarism
on
account
of
its
convenience
means
a
gratuity
or
something
paid
to
a
person
who
has
not
earned
translator
when
he
presented
himself
next
day
at
madame
dambreuse
residence
he
was
informed
that
she
was
busy
below
stairs
in
the
room
where
dambreuse
had
kept
his
papers
the
cardboard
receptacles
and
the
different
drawers
had
been
opened
confusedly
and
the
had
been
flung
about
right
and
left
a
roll
of
papers
on
which
were
endorsed
the
words
repayment
hopeless
lay
on
the
ground
he
was
near
falling
over
it
and
picked
it
up
madame
dambreuse
had
sunk
back
in
the
armchair
so
that
he
did
not
see
her
well
where
are
you
what
is
the
matter
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
bound
what
is
the
matter
i
am
ruined
ruined
do
you
understand
adolphe
langlois
the
notary
had
sent
her
a
message
to
call
at
his
office
and
had
informed
her
about
the
contents
of
a
will
made
by
her
husband
before
their
marriage
he
had
bequeathed
everything
to
cécile
and
the
other
will
was
lost
frederick
turned
very
pale
no
doubt
she
had
not
made
sufficient
search
well
then
look
yourself
said
madame
dambreuse
pointing
at
the
objects
contained
in
the
room
the
two
were
gaping
wide
having
been
broken
open
with
blows
of
a
cleaver
and
she
had
turned
up
the
desk
rummaged
in
the
cupboards
and
shaken
the
when
all
of
a
sudden
uttering
a
piercing
cry
she
dashed
into
corner
where
she
had
just
noticed
a
little
box
with
a
brass
lock
she
opened
it
nothing
ah
the
wretch
i
who
took
such
devoted
care
of
him
then
she
burst
into
sobs
perhaps
it
is
somewhere
else
said
frederick
oh
no
it
was
there
in
that
i
saw
it
there
lately
is
burned
i
certain
of
it
one
day
in
the
early
stage
of
his
illness
dambreuse
had
gone
down
to
this
room
to
sign
some
documents
is
then
he
must
have
done
the
trick
and
she
fell
back
on
a
chair
crushed
a
mother
grieving
beside
an
empty
cradle
was
not
more
woeful
than
madame
dambreuse
was
at
the
sight
of
the
open
indeed
her
sorrow
in
spite
of
the
baseness
of
the
motive
which
inspired
it
appeared
so
deep
that
he
tried
to
console
her
by
reminding
her
that
after
all
she
was
not
reduced
to
sheer
want
it
is
want
when
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
offer
you
a
large
fortune
she
had
not
more
than
thirty
thousand
livres
a
year
without
taking
into
account
the
mansion
which
was
worth
from
eighteen
to
twenty
thousand
perhaps
although
to
frederick
this
would
have
been
opulence
he
felt
none
the
less
a
certain
amount
of
disappointment
farewell
to
his
dreams
and
to
all
the
splendid
existence
on
which
he
had
intended
to
enter
honour
compelled
him
to
marry
madame
dambreuse
for
a
minute
he
reflected
then
in
a
tone
of
tenderness
i
always
have
yourself
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
with
an
emotion
in
which
there
was
a
slight
element
of
admiration
for
himself
madame
dambreuse
whose
tears
had
ceased
to
flow
raised
her
face
beaming
all
over
with
happiness
and
seizing
his
hand
ah
i
never
doubted
you
i
knew
i
could
count
on
you
the
young
man
did
not
like
this
tone
of
anticipated
certainty
with
regard
to
what
he
was
pluming
himself
on
as
a
noble
action
then
she
brought
him
into
her
own
apartment
and
they
began
to
arrange
their
plans
for
the
future
frederick
should
now
consider
the
best
way
of
advancing
himself
in
life
she
even
gave
him
excellent
advice
with
reference
to
his
candidature
the
first
point
was
to
be
acquainted
with
two
or
three
phrases
borrowed
from
political
economy
it
was
necessary
to
take
up
a
specialty
such
as
the
stud
system
for
example
to
write
a
number
of
notes
on
questions
of
local
interest
to
have
always
at
his
disposal
or
tobacconists
shops
and
to
do
a
heap
of
little
services
in
this
respect
dambreuse
had
shown
himself
a
true
model
thus
on
one
occasion
in
the
country
he
had
drawn
up
his
wagonette
full
of
friends
of
his
in
front
of
a
cobbler
stall
and
had
bought
a
dozen
pairs
of
shoes
for
his
guests
and
for
himself
a
dreadful
pair
of
boots
which
he
had
not
even
the
courage
to
wear
for
an
entire
fortnight
this
anecdote
put
them
into
a
good
humour
she
related
others
and
that
with
a
renewal
of
grace
youthfulness
and
wit
she
approved
of
his
notion
of
taking
a
trip
immediately
to
nogent
their
parting
was
an
affectionate
one
then
on
the
threshold
she
murmured
once
more
you
love
me
do
you
not
eternally
was
his
reply
a
messenger
was
waiting
for
him
at
his
own
house
with
a
line
written
in
informing
him
that
rosanette
was
about
to
be
confined
he
had
been
so
much
preoccupied
for
the
past
few
days
that
he
had
not
bestowed
a
thought
upon
the
matter
she
had
been
placed
in
a
special
establishment
at
chaillot
frederick
took
a
cab
and
set
out
for
this
institution
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
marbeuf
he
read
on
a
board
in
big
letters
private
kept
by
madame
alessandri
midwife
of
the
maternity
author
of
various
works
etc
then
in
the
centre
of
the
street
over
the
door
a
little
there
was
another
signboard
private
hospital
of
madame
alessandri
with
all
her
titles
frederick
gave
a
knock
a
chambermaid
with
the
figure
of
an
abigail
introduced
him
into
the
which
was
adorned
with
a
mahogany
table
and
armchairs
of
garnet
velvet
and
with
a
clock
under
a
globe
almost
immediately
madame
appeared
she
was
a
tall
brunette
of
forty
with
a
slender
waist
fine
eyes
and
the
manners
of
good
society
she
apprised
frederick
of
the
mother
happy
delivery
and
brought
him
up
to
her
apartment
rosanette
broke
into
a
smile
of
unutterable
bliss
and
as
if
drowned
in
the
floods
of
love
that
were
suffocating
her
she
said
in
a
low
tone
a
boy
there
there
pointing
towards
a
cradle
close
to
her
bed
he
flung
open
the
curtains
and
saw
wrapped
up
in
linen
a
object
exceedingly
which
had
a
bad
smell
and
which
was
bawling
lustily
embrace
him
he
replied
in
order
to
hide
his
repugnance
but
i
am
afraid
of
hurting
him
no
no
then
with
the
tips
of
his
lips
he
kissed
his
child
how
like
you
he
is
and
with
her
two
weak
arms
she
clung
to
his
neck
with
an
outburst
of
feeling
which
he
had
never
witnessed
on
her
part
before
the
remembrance
of
madame
dambreuse
came
back
to
him
he
reproached
himself
as
a
monster
for
having
deceived
this
poor
creature
who
loved
and
suffered
with
all
the
sincerity
of
her
nature
for
several
days
he
remained
with
her
till
night
she
felt
happy
in
this
quiet
place
the
in
front
of
it
remained
always
closed
her
room
hung
with
bright
chintz
looked
out
on
a
large
garden
madame
alessandri
whose
only
shortcoming
was
that
she
liked
to
talk
about
her
intimate
acquaintanceship
with
eminent
physicians
showed
her
the
utmost
attention
her
associates
nearly
all
provincial
young
ladies
were
exceedingly
bored
as
they
had
nobody
to
come
to
see
them
rosanette
saw
that
they
regarded
her
with
envy
and
told
this
to
frederick
with
pride
it
was
desirable
to
speak
low
nevertheless
the
partitions
were
thin
and
everyone
stood
listening
at
in
spite
of
the
constant
thrumming
of
the
pianos
at
last
he
was
about
to
take
his
departure
for
nogent
when
he
got
a
letter
from
deslauriers
two
fresh
candidates
had
offered
themselves
the
one
a
conservative
the
other
a
red
a
third
whatever
he
might
be
would
have
no
chance
it
was
all
frederick
fault
he
had
let
the
lucky
moment
pass
by
he
should
have
come
sooner
and
stirred
himself
you
have
not
even
been
seen
at
the
agricultural
assembly
the
advocate
blamed
him
for
not
having
any
newspaper
connection
ah
if
you
had
followed
my
advice
long
ago
if
we
had
only
a
public
print
of
our
own
he
laid
special
stress
on
this
point
however
many
persons
who
would
have
voted
for
him
out
of
consideration
for
dambreuse
abandoned
him
now
deslauriers
was
one
of
the
number
not
having
anything
more
to
expect
from
the
capitalist
he
had
thrown
over
his
frederick
took
the
letter
to
show
it
to
madame
dambreuse
you
have
not
been
to
nogent
then
said
she
why
do
you
ask
because
i
saw
deslauriers
three
days
ago
having
learned
that
her
husband
was
dead
the
advocate
had
come
to
make
a
report
about
the
and
to
offer
his
services
to
her
as
a
man
of
business
this
seemed
strange
to
frederick
and
what
was
his
friend
doing
down
there
madame
dambreuse
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
spent
his
time
since
they
had
parted
i
have
been
ill
he
replied
you
ought
at
least
to
have
told
me
about
it
oh
it
was
worth
while
besides
he
had
to
settle
a
heap
of
things
to
keep
appointments
and
to
pay
visits
from
that
time
forth
he
led
a
double
life
sleeping
religiously
at
the
maréchale
abode
and
passing
the
afternoon
with
madame
dambreuse
so
that
there
was
scarcely
a
single
hour
of
freedom
left
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
infant
was
in
the
country
at
andilly
they
went
to
see
it
once
a
week
the
house
was
on
rising
ground
in
the
village
at
the
end
of
a
little
yard
as
dark
as
a
pit
with
straw
on
the
ground
hens
here
and
there
and
a
under
the
shed
rosanette
would
begin
by
frantically
kissing
her
baby
and
seized
with
a
kind
of
delirium
would
keep
moving
to
and
fro
trying
to
milk
the
eating
big
pieces
of
bread
and
inhaling
the
odour
of
manure
she
even
wanted
to
put
a
little
of
it
into
her
handkerchief
then
they
took
long
walks
in
the
course
of
which
she
went
into
the
nurseries
tore
off
branches
from
the
which
hung
down
over
the
walls
and
exclaimed
gee
ho
donkey
to
the
asses
that
were
drawing
cars
along
and
stopped
to
gaze
through
the
gate
into
the
interior
of
one
of
the
lovely
gardens
or
else
the
would
take
the
child
and
place
it
under
the
shade
of
a
and
for
hours
the
two
women
would
keep
talking
the
most
tiresome
nonsense
frederick
not
far
away
from
them
gazed
at
the
beds
of
vines
on
the
slopes
with
here
and
there
a
clump
of
trees
at
the
dusty
paths
resembling
strips
of
grey
ribbon
at
the
houses
which
showed
white
and
red
spots
in
the
midst
of
the
greenery
and
sometimes
the
smoke
of
a
locomotive
stretched
out
horizontally
to
the
bases
of
the
hills
covered
with
foliage
like
a
gigantic
ostrich
feather
the
thin
end
of
which
was
disappearing
from
view
then
his
eyes
once
more
rested
on
his
son
he
imagined
the
child
grown
into
a
young
man
he
would
make
a
companion
of
him
but
perhaps
he
would
be
a
blockhead
a
wretched
creature
in
any
event
he
was
always
oppressed
by
the
illegality
of
the
infant
birth
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
never
been
born
and
frederick
would
murmur
poor
child
his
heart
swelling
with
feelings
of
unutterable
sadness
they
often
missed
the
last
train
then
madame
dambreuse
would
scold
him
for
his
want
of
punctuality
he
would
invent
some
falsehood
it
was
necessary
to
invent
some
explanations
too
to
satisfy
rosanette
she
could
not
understand
how
he
spent
all
his
evenings
and
when
she
sent
a
messenger
to
his
house
he
was
never
there
one
day
when
he
chanced
to
be
at
home
the
two
women
made
their
appearance
almost
at
the
same
time
he
got
the
maréchale
to
go
away
and
concealed
madame
dambreuse
pretending
that
his
mother
was
coming
up
to
paris
ere
long
he
found
these
lies
amusing
he
would
repeat
to
one
the
oath
which
he
had
just
uttered
to
the
other
send
them
bouquets
of
the
same
sort
write
to
them
at
the
same
time
and
then
would
institute
a
comparison
between
them
there
was
a
third
always
present
in
his
thoughts
the
impossibility
of
possessing
her
seemed
to
him
a
justification
of
his
perfidies
which
were
intensified
by
the
fact
that
he
had
to
practise
them
alternately
and
the
more
he
deceived
no
matter
which
of
the
two
the
fonder
of
him
she
grew
as
if
the
love
of
one
of
them
added
heat
to
that
of
the
other
and
as
if
by
a
sort
of
emulation
each
of
them
were
seeking
to
make
him
forget
the
other
admire
my
confidence
in
you
said
madame
dambreuse
one
day
to
him
opening
a
sheet
of
paper
in
which
she
was
informed
that
moreau
and
a
certain
rose
bron
were
living
together
as
husband
and
wife
can
it
be
that
this
is
the
lady
of
the
races
what
an
absurdity
he
returned
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
the
letter
written
in
roman
characters
had
no
signature
madame
dambreuse
in
the
beginning
had
tolerated
this
mistress
who
furnished
a
cloak
for
their
adultery
but
as
her
passion
became
stronger
she
had
insisted
on
a
rupture
a
thing
which
had
been
effected
long
since
according
to
frederick
account
and
when
he
had
ceased
to
protest
she
replied
half
closing
her
eyes
in
which
shone
a
look
like
the
point
of
a
stiletto
under
a
muslin
robe
well
and
the
other
what
other
the
wife
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
she
did
not
press
the
matter
but
a
month
later
while
they
were
talking
about
honour
and
loyalty
and
he
was
boasting
about
his
own
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
for
the
sake
of
precaution
she
said
to
him
it
is
true
you
are
acting
uprightly
you
do
go
back
there
any
more
frederick
who
was
at
the
moment
thinking
of
the
maréchale
stammered
where
pray
to
madame
arnoux
he
implored
her
to
tell
him
from
whom
she
got
the
information
it
was
through
her
second
dressmaker
madame
regimbart
so
she
knew
all
about
his
life
and
he
knew
nothing
about
hers
in
the
meantime
he
had
found
in
her
the
miniature
of
a
gentleman
with
long
moustaches
was
this
the
same
person
about
whose
suicide
a
vague
story
had
been
told
him
at
one
time
but
there
was
no
way
of
learning
any
more
about
it
however
what
was
the
use
of
it
the
hearts
of
women
are
like
little
pieces
of
furniture
wherein
things
are
secreted
full
of
drawers
fitted
into
each
other
one
hurts
himself
breaks
his
nails
in
opening
them
and
then
finds
within
only
some
withered
flower
a
few
grains
of
dust
or
emptiness
and
then
perhaps
he
felt
afraid
of
learning
too
much
about
the
matter
she
made
him
refuse
invitations
where
she
was
unable
to
accompany
him
stuck
to
his
side
was
afraid
of
losing
him
and
in
spite
of
this
union
which
was
every
day
becoming
stronger
all
of
a
sudden
abysses
disclosed
themselves
between
the
pair
about
the
most
trifling
questions
an
estimate
of
an
individual
or
a
work
of
art
she
had
a
style
of
playing
on
the
piano
which
was
correct
and
hard
her
spiritualism
madame
dambreuse
believed
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
into
the
stars
did
not
prevent
her
from
taking
the
utmost
care
of
her
she
was
haughty
towards
her
servants
her
eyes
remained
dry
at
the
sight
of
the
rags
of
the
poor
in
the
expressions
of
which
she
habitually
made
use
a
candid
egoism
manifested
itself
what
concern
is
that
of
mine
i
should
be
very
silly
what
need
have
i
and
a
thousand
little
acts
incapable
of
analysis
revealed
hateful
qualities
in
her
she
would
have
listened
behind
doors
she
could
not
help
lying
to
her
confessor
through
a
spirit
of
despotism
she
insisted
on
frederick
going
to
the
church
with
her
on
sunday
he
obeyed
and
carried
her
the
loss
of
the
property
she
had
expected
to
inherit
had
changed
her
considerably
these
marks
of
grief
which
people
attributed
to
the
death
of
dambreuse
rendered
her
interesting
and
as
in
former
times
she
had
a
great
number
of
visitors
since
frederick
defeat
at
the
election
she
was
ambitious
of
obtaining
for
both
of
them
an
embassy
in
germany
therefore
the
first
thing
they
should
do
was
to
submit
to
the
reigning
ideas
some
persons
were
in
favour
of
the
empire
others
of
the
orléans
family
and
others
of
the
comte
de
chambord
but
they
were
all
of
one
opinion
as
to
the
urgency
of
decentralisation
and
several
expedients
were
proposed
with
that
view
such
as
to
cut
up
paris
into
many
large
streets
in
order
to
establish
villages
there
to
transfer
the
seat
of
government
to
versailles
to
have
the
schools
set
up
at
bourges
to
suppress
the
libraries
and
to
entrust
everything
to
the
generals
of
division
and
they
glorified
a
rustic
existence
on
the
assumption
that
the
uneducated
man
had
naturally
more
sense
than
other
men
hatreds
increased
hatred
of
primary
teachers
and
of
the
classes
of
philosophy
of
the
courses
of
lectures
on
history
of
novels
red
waistcoats
long
beards
of
independence
in
any
shape
or
any
manifestation
of
individuality
for
it
was
necessary
to
restore
the
principle
of
authority
let
it
be
exercised
in
the
name
of
no
matter
whom
let
it
come
from
no
matter
where
as
long
as
it
was
force
authority
the
conservatives
now
talked
in
the
very
same
way
as
sénécal
frederick
was
no
longer
able
to
understand
their
drift
and
once
more
he
found
at
the
house
of
his
former
mistress
the
same
remarks
uttered
by
the
same
men
the
salons
of
the
unmarried
women
it
was
from
this
period
that
their
importance
dates
were
a
sort
of
neutral
ground
where
reactionaries
of
different
kinds
met
hussonnet
who
gave
himself
up
to
the
depreciation
of
contemporary
glories
a
good
thing
for
the
restoration
of
order
inspired
rosanette
with
a
longing
to
have
evening
parties
like
any
other
he
undertook
to
publish
accounts
of
them
and
first
of
all
he
brought
a
man
of
grave
deportment
fumichon
then
came
nonancourt
de
grémonville
the
sieur
de
larsilloix
and
cisy
who
was
now
an
agriculturist
in
lower
brittany
and
more
christian
than
ever
in
addition
men
who
had
at
one
time
been
the
maréchale
lovers
such
as
the
baron
de
comaing
the
comte
de
jumillac
and
others
presented
themselves
and
frederick
was
annoyed
by
their
behaviour
in
order
that
he
might
assume
the
attitude
of
master
in
the
house
he
increased
the
rate
of
expenditure
there
then
he
went
in
for
keeping
a
groom
took
a
new
habitation
and
got
a
fresh
supply
of
furniture
these
displays
of
extravagance
were
useful
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
alliance
appear
less
out
of
proportion
with
his
pecuniary
position
the
result
was
that
his
means
were
soon
terribly
reduced
and
rosanette
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
fact
one
of
the
lower
who
had
lost
caste
she
adored
a
domestic
life
a
quiet
little
home
however
it
gave
her
pleasure
to
have
an
at
home
day
in
referring
to
persons
of
her
own
class
she
called
them
those
women
she
wished
to
be
a
society
lady
and
believed
herself
to
be
one
she
begged
of
him
not
to
smoke
in
the
any
more
and
for
the
sake
of
good
form
tried
to
make
herself
look
thin
she
played
her
part
badly
after
all
for
she
grew
serious
and
even
before
going
to
bed
always
exhibited
a
little
melancholy
just
as
there
are
cypress
trees
at
the
door
of
a
tavern
he
found
out
the
cause
of
it
she
was
dreaming
of
marriage
she
too
frederick
was
exasperated
at
this
besides
he
recalled
to
mind
her
appearance
at
madame
arnoux
house
and
then
he
cherished
a
certain
spite
against
her
for
having
held
out
against
him
so
long
he
made
enquiries
none
the
less
as
to
who
her
lovers
had
been
she
denied
having
had
any
relations
with
any
of
the
persons
he
mentioned
a
sort
of
jealous
feeling
took
possession
of
him
he
irritated
her
by
asking
questions
about
presents
that
had
been
made
to
her
and
were
still
being
made
to
her
and
in
proportion
to
the
exciting
effect
which
the
lower
portion
of
her
nature
produced
upon
him
he
was
drawn
towards
her
by
momentary
illusions
which
ended
in
hate
her
words
her
voice
her
smile
all
had
an
unpleasant
effect
on
him
and
especially
her
glances
with
that
woman
eye
forever
limpid
and
foolish
sometimes
he
felt
so
tired
of
her
that
he
would
have
seen
her
die
without
being
moved
at
it
but
how
could
he
get
into
a
passion
with
her
she
was
so
mild
that
there
was
no
hope
of
picking
a
quarrel
with
her
deslauriers
reappeared
and
explained
his
sojourn
at
nogent
by
saying
that
he
was
making
arrangements
to
buy
a
lawyer
office
frederick
was
glad
to
see
him
again
it
was
somebody
and
as
a
third
person
in
the
house
he
helped
to
break
the
monotony
the
advocate
dined
with
them
from
time
to
time
and
whenever
any
little
disputes
arose
always
took
rosanette
part
so
that
frederick
on
one
occasion
said
to
him
ah
you
can
have
with
her
if
it
amuses
you
so
much
did
he
long
for
some
chance
of
getting
rid
of
her
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
june
she
was
served
with
an
order
made
by
the
law
courts
by
which
maître
athanase
gautherot
sheriff
officer
called
on
her
to
pay
him
four
thousand
francs
due
to
mademoiselle
clemence
vatnaz
if
not
he
would
come
to
make
a
seizure
on
her
in
fact
of
the
four
bills
which
she
had
at
various
times
signed
only
one
had
been
paid
the
money
which
she
happened
to
get
since
then
having
been
spent
on
other
things
that
she
required
she
rushed
off
at
once
to
see
arnoux
he
lived
now
in
the
faubourg
and
the
porter
was
unable
to
tell
her
the
name
of
the
street
she
made
her
way
next
to
the
houses
of
several
friends
of
hers
could
not
find
one
of
them
at
home
and
came
back
in
a
state
of
utter
despair
she
did
not
wish
to
tell
frederick
anything
about
it
fearing
lest
this
new
occurrence
might
prejudice
the
chance
of
a
marriage
between
them
on
the
following
morning
athanase
gautherot
presented
himself
with
two
assistants
close
behind
him
one
of
them
sallow
with
a
face
and
an
expression
of
devouring
envy
in
his
glance
the
other
wearing
a
collar
and
straps
drawn
very
tightly
with
a
sort
of
thimble
of
black
taffeta
on
his
and
both
ignobly
dirty
with
greasy
necks
and
the
sleeves
of
their
coats
too
short
their
employer
a
very
man
on
the
contrary
began
by
apologising
for
the
disagreeable
duty
he
had
to
perform
while
at
the
same
time
he
threw
a
look
round
the
room
full
of
pretty
things
upon
my
word
of
honour
he
added
not
to
speak
of
the
things
that
ca
be
seized
at
a
gesture
the
two
bailiff
men
disappeared
then
he
became
twice
as
polite
as
before
could
anyone
believe
that
a
lady
so
charming
would
not
have
a
genuine
friend
a
sale
of
her
goods
under
an
order
of
the
courts
would
be
a
real
misfortune
one
never
gets
over
a
thing
like
that
he
tried
to
excite
her
fears
then
seeing
that
she
was
very
much
agitated
suddenly
assumed
a
paternal
tone
he
knew
the
world
he
had
been
brought
into
business
relations
with
all
these
ladies
and
as
he
mentioned
their
names
he
examined
the
frames
of
the
pictures
on
the
walls
they
were
old
pictures
of
the
worthy
arnoux
sketches
by
sombary
by
burieu
and
three
landscapes
by
dittmer
it
was
evident
that
rosanette
was
ignorant
of
their
value
maître
gautherot
turned
round
to
her
look
here
to
show
that
i
am
a
decent
fellow
do
one
thing
give
me
up
those
dittmers
here
and
i
am
ready
to
pay
all
do
you
agree
at
that
moment
frederick
who
had
been
informed
about
the
matter
by
delphine
in
the
anteroom
and
who
had
just
seen
the
two
assistants
came
in
with
his
hat
on
his
head
in
a
rude
fashion
maître
gautherot
resumed
his
dignity
and
as
the
door
had
been
left
open
come
on
gentlemen
write
down
in
the
second
room
let
us
say
an
oak
table
with
its
two
leaves
two
sideboards
frederick
here
stopped
him
asking
whether
there
was
not
some
way
of
preventing
the
seizure
oh
certainly
who
paid
for
the
furniture
i
did
well
draw
up
a
claim
you
have
still
time
to
do
it
maître
gautherot
did
not
take
long
in
writing
out
his
official
report
wherein
he
directed
that
mademoiselle
bron
should
attend
at
an
enquiry
in
chambers
with
reference
to
the
ownership
of
the
furniture
and
having
done
this
he
withdrew
frederick
uttered
no
reproach
he
gazed
at
the
traces
of
mud
left
on
the
floor
by
the
bailiff
shoes
and
speaking
to
himself
it
will
soon
be
necessary
to
look
about
for
money
ah
my
god
how
stupid
i
am
said
the
maréchale
she
ransacked
a
drawer
took
out
a
letter
and
made
her
way
rapidly
to
the
languedoc
gas
lighting
company
in
order
to
get
the
transfer
of
her
shares
she
came
back
an
hour
later
the
interest
in
the
shares
had
been
sold
to
another
the
clerk
had
said
in
answer
to
her
demand
while
examining
the
sheet
of
paper
containing
arnoux
written
promise
to
her
this
document
in
no
way
constitutes
you
the
proprietor
of
the
shares
the
company
has
no
cognisance
of
the
matter
in
short
he
sent
her
away
unceremoniously
while
she
choked
with
rage
and
frederick
would
have
to
go
to
arnoux
house
at
once
to
have
the
matter
cleared
up
but
arnoux
would
perhaps
imagine
that
he
had
come
to
recover
in
an
indirect
fashion
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
due
on
the
mortgage
which
he
had
lost
and
then
this
claim
from
a
man
who
had
been
his
lover
seemed
to
him
a
piece
of
baseness
selecting
a
middle
course
he
went
to
the
dambreuse
mansion
to
get
madame
regimbart
address
sent
a
messenger
to
her
residence
and
in
this
way
ascertained
the
name
of
the
café
which
the
citizen
now
haunted
it
was
the
little
café
on
the
place
de
la
bastille
in
which
he
sat
all
day
in
the
corner
to
the
right
at
the
lower
end
of
the
establishment
never
moving
any
more
than
if
he
were
a
portion
of
the
building
after
having
gone
successively
through
the
of
coffee
the
glass
of
grog
the
bishop
the
glass
of
mulled
wine
and
even
the
red
wine
and
water
he
fell
back
on
beer
and
every
half
hour
he
let
fall
this
word
bock
having
reduced
his
language
to
what
was
actually
indispensable
frederick
asked
him
if
he
saw
arnoux
occasionally
no
look
here
why
an
imbecile
politics
perhaps
kept
them
apart
and
so
frederick
thought
it
a
judicious
thing
to
enquire
about
compain
what
a
brute
said
regimbart
how
is
that
his
calf
head
ha
explain
to
me
what
the
calf
head
is
regimbart
face
wore
a
contemptuous
smile
some
tomfoolery
after
a
long
interval
of
silence
frederick
went
on
to
ask
so
then
he
has
changed
his
address
who
arnoux
yes
rue
de
fleurus
what
number
do
i
associate
with
the
jesuits
what
jesuits
the
citizen
replied
angrily
with
the
money
of
a
patriot
whom
i
introduced
to
him
this
pig
has
set
up
as
a
dealer
in
beads
it
is
possible
go
there
and
see
for
yourself
it
was
perfectly
true
arnoux
enfeebled
by
a
fit
of
sickness
had
turned
religious
besides
he
had
always
had
a
stock
of
religion
in
his
composition
and
with
that
mixture
of
commercialism
and
ingenuity
which
was
natural
to
him
in
order
to
gain
salvation
and
fortune
both
together
he
had
begun
to
traffick
in
religious
objects
frederick
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
his
establishment
on
whose
signboard
appeared
these
words
of
gothic
restoration
of
articles
used
in
ecclesiastical
ceremonies
church
ornaments
polychromatic
sculpture
frankincense
of
the
magi
kings
at
the
two
corners
of
the
rose
two
wooden
statues
streaked
with
gold
cinnabar
and
azure
a
saint
john
the
baptist
with
his
sheepskin
and
a
saint
genevieve
with
roses
in
her
apron
and
a
distaff
under
her
arm
next
groups
in
plaster
a
good
sister
teaching
a
little
girl
a
mother
on
her
knees
beside
a
little
bed
and
three
collegians
before
the
holy
table
the
prettiest
object
there
was
a
kind
of
châlet
representing
the
interior
of
a
crib
with
the
ass
the
ox
and
the
child
jesus
stretched
on
straw
real
straw
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
shelves
could
be
seen
medals
by
the
dozen
every
sort
of
beads
basins
in
the
form
of
shells
and
portraits
of
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
amongst
whom
monsignor
affre
and
our
holy
father
shone
forth
with
smiles
on
their
faces
arnoux
sat
asleep
at
his
counter
with
his
head
down
he
had
aged
terribly
he
had
even
round
his
temples
a
wreath
of
rosebuds
and
the
reflection
of
the
gold
crosses
touched
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
over
him
frederick
was
filled
with
sadness
at
this
spectacle
of
decay
through
devotion
to
the
maréchale
he
however
submitted
to
the
ordeal
and
stepped
forward
at
the
end
of
the
shop
madame
arnoux
showed
herself
thereupon
he
turned
on
his
heel
i
could
see
him
he
said
when
he
came
back
to
rosanette
and
in
vain
he
went
on
to
promise
that
he
would
write
at
once
to
his
notary
at
havre
for
some
money
she
flew
into
a
rage
she
had
never
seen
a
man
so
weak
so
flabby
while
she
was
enduring
a
thousand
privations
other
people
were
enjoying
themselves
frederick
was
thinking
about
poor
madame
arnoux
and
picturing
to
himself
the
impoverishment
of
her
surroundings
he
had
seated
himself
before
the
and
as
rosanette
voice
still
kept
up
its
bitter
railing
ah
in
the
name
of
heaven
hold
your
tongue
perhaps
you
are
going
to
defend
them
well
yes
he
exclaimed
for
what
the
cause
of
this
display
of
fury
but
why
is
it
that
you
do
want
to
make
them
pay
up
is
for
fear
of
vexing
your
old
flame
confess
it
he
felt
an
inclination
to
smash
her
head
with
the
timepiece
words
failed
him
he
relapsed
into
silence
rosanette
as
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
continued
i
am
going
to
hurl
a
writ
at
this
arnoux
of
yours
oh
i
do
want
your
assistance
i
get
legal
advice
three
days
later
delphine
rushed
abruptly
into
the
room
where
her
mistress
sat
madame
madame
there
a
man
here
with
a
pot
of
paste
who
has
given
me
a
fright
rosanette
made
her
way
down
to
the
kitchen
and
saw
there
a
vagabond
whose
face
was
pitted
with
smallpox
moreover
one
of
his
arms
was
paralysed
and
he
was
three
fourths
drunk
and
hiccoughed
every
time
he
attempted
to
speak
this
was
maître
gautherot
the
objections
raised
against
the
seizure
having
been
overruled
the
sale
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
for
his
trouble
in
getting
up
the
stairs
he
demanded
in
the
first
place
a
of
brandy
then
he
wanted
another
favour
namely
tickets
for
the
theatre
on
the
assumption
that
the
lady
of
the
house
was
an
actress
after
this
he
indulged
for
some
minutes
in
winks
whose
import
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
finally
he
declared
that
for
forty
sous
he
would
tear
off
the
corners
of
the
poster
which
he
had
already
affixed
to
the
door
below
stairs
rosanette
found
herself
referred
to
by
name
in
it
a
piece
of
exceptional
harshness
which
showed
the
spite
of
the
vatnaz
she
had
at
one
time
exhibited
sensibility
and
had
even
while
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
heartache
written
to
béranger
for
his
advice
but
under
the
ravages
of
life
storms
her
spirit
had
become
soured
for
she
had
been
forced
in
turn
to
give
lessons
on
the
piano
to
act
as
manageress
of
a
to
assist
others
in
writing
for
the
fashion
journals
to
sublet
apartments
and
to
traffic
in
lace
in
the
world
of
light
women
her
relations
with
whom
enabled
her
to
make
herself
useful
to
many
persons
and
amongst
others
to
arnoux
she
had
formerly
been
employed
in
a
commercial
establishment
there
it
was
one
of
her
functions
to
pay
the
workwomen
and
for
each
of
them
there
were
two
livres
one
of
which
always
remained
in
her
hands
dussardier
who
through
kindness
kept
the
amount
payable
to
a
girl
named
hortense
baslin
presented
himself
one
day
at
the
at
the
moment
when
mademoiselle
vatnaz
was
presenting
this
girl
account
francs
which
the
cashier
paid
her
now
on
the
very
day
before
this
dussardier
had
entered
down
the
sum
as
in
the
girl
book
he
asked
to
have
it
given
back
to
him
on
some
pretext
then
anxious
to
bury
out
of
sight
the
story
of
this
theft
he
stated
that
he
had
lost
it
the
workwoman
ingenuously
repeated
this
falsehood
to
mademoiselle
vatnaz
and
the
latter
in
order
to
satisfy
her
mind
about
the
matter
came
with
a
show
of
indifference
to
talk
to
the
shopman
on
the
subject
he
contented
himself
with
the
answer
i
have
burned
it
that
was
all
a
little
while
afterwards
she
quitted
the
house
without
believing
that
the
book
had
been
really
destroyed
and
filled
with
the
idea
that
dussardier
had
preserved
it
on
hearing
that
he
had
been
wounded
she
rushed
to
his
abode
with
the
object
of
getting
it
back
then
having
discovered
nothing
in
spite
of
the
closest
searches
she
was
seized
with
respect
and
presently
with
love
for
this
youth
so
loyal
so
gentle
so
heroic
and
so
strong
at
her
age
such
good
fortune
in
an
affair
of
the
heart
was
a
thing
that
one
would
not
expect
she
threw
herself
into
it
with
the
appetite
of
an
ogress
and
she
had
given
up
literature
socialism
the
consoling
doctrines
and
the
generous
utopias
the
course
of
lectures
which
she
had
projected
on
the
desubalternization
of
woman
everything
even
delmar
himself
finally
she
offered
to
unite
herself
to
dussardier
in
marriage
although
she
was
his
mistress
he
was
not
at
all
in
love
with
her
besides
he
had
not
forgotten
her
theft
then
she
was
too
wealthy
for
him
he
refused
her
offer
thereupon
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
told
him
about
what
she
had
dreamed
it
was
to
have
for
both
of
them
a
confectioner
shop
she
possessed
the
capital
that
was
required
beforehand
for
the
purpose
and
next
week
this
would
be
increased
to
the
extent
of
four
thousand
francs
by
way
of
explanation
she
referred
to
the
proceedings
she
had
taken
against
the
maréchale
dussardier
was
annoyed
at
this
on
account
of
his
friend
he
recalled
to
mind
the
that
had
been
presented
to
him
at
the
the
evenings
spent
in
the
quai
napoléon
the
many
pleasant
chats
the
books
lent
to
him
the
thousand
acts
of
kindness
which
frederick
had
done
in
his
behalf
he
begged
of
the
vatnaz
to
abandon
the
proceedings
she
rallied
him
on
his
good
nature
while
exhibiting
an
antipathy
against
rosanette
which
he
could
not
understand
she
longed
only
for
wealth
in
fact
in
order
to
crush
her
with
her
carriage
dussardier
was
terrified
by
these
black
abysses
of
hate
and
when
he
had
ascertained
what
was
the
exact
day
fixed
for
the
sale
he
hurried
out
on
the
following
morning
he
made
his
appearance
at
frederick
house
with
an
embarrassed
countenance
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
what
pray
you
must
take
me
for
an
ingrate
i
whom
she
is
the
he
faltered
oh
i
see
no
more
of
her
i
am
not
going
to
be
her
accomplice
and
as
the
other
was
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
is
your
mistress
furniture
to
be
sold
in
three
days
time
who
told
you
that
herself
the
vatnaz
but
i
am
afraid
of
giving
you
offence
impossible
my
dear
friend
ah
that
is
true
you
are
so
good
and
he
held
out
to
him
in
a
cautious
fashion
a
hand
in
which
he
clasped
a
little
made
of
it
contained
four
thousand
francs
all
his
savings
what
oh
no
no
i
knew
well
i
would
wound
your
feelings
returned
dussardier
with
a
tear
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
frederick
pressed
his
hand
and
the
honest
fellow
went
on
in
a
piteous
tone
take
the
money
give
me
that
much
pleasure
i
am
in
such
a
state
of
despair
can
it
be
furthermore
that
all
is
over
i
thought
we
should
be
happy
when
the
revolution
had
come
do
you
remember
what
a
beautiful
thing
it
was
how
freely
we
breathed
but
here
we
are
flung
back
into
a
worse
condition
of
things
than
ever
now
they
are
killing
our
republic
just
as
they
killed
the
other
one
the
roman
ay
and
poor
venice
poor
poland
poor
hungary
what
abominable
deeds
first
of
all
they
knocked
down
the
trees
of
liberty
then
they
restricted
the
right
to
vote
shut
up
the
clubs
the
censorship
and
surrendered
to
the
priests
the
power
of
teaching
so
that
we
might
look
out
for
the
inquisition
why
not
the
conservatives
want
to
give
us
a
taste
of
the
stick
the
newspapers
are
fined
merely
for
pronouncing
an
opinion
in
favour
of
abolishing
the
paris
is
overflowing
with
bayonets
sixteen
departments
are
in
a
state
of
siege
and
then
the
demand
for
amnesty
is
again
rejected
he
placed
both
hands
on
his
forehead
then
spreading
out
his
arms
as
if
his
mind
were
in
a
distracted
state
if
however
we
only
made
the
effort
if
we
were
only
sincere
we
might
understand
each
other
but
no
the
workmen
are
no
better
than
the
capitalists
you
see
at
elboeuf
recently
they
refused
to
help
at
a
fire
there
are
wretches
who
profess
to
regard
barbès
as
an
aristocrat
in
order
to
make
the
people
ridiculous
they
want
to
get
nominated
for
the
presidency
nadaud
a
mason
just
imagine
and
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
no
remedy
everybody
is
against
us
for
my
part
i
have
never
done
any
harm
and
yet
this
is
like
a
weight
pressing
down
on
my
stomach
if
this
state
of
things
continues
i
go
mad
i
have
a
mind
to
do
away
with
myself
i
tell
you
i
want
no
money
for
myself
you
pay
it
back
to
me
deuce
take
it
i
am
lending
it
to
you
frederick
who
felt
himself
constrained
by
necessity
ended
by
taking
the
four
thousand
francs
from
him
and
so
they
had
no
more
disquietude
so
far
as
the
vatnaz
was
concerned
but
it
was
not
long
ere
rosanette
was
defeated
in
her
action
against
arnoux
and
through
sheer
obstinacy
she
wished
to
appeal
deslauriers
exhausted
his
energies
in
trying
to
make
her
understand
that
arnoux
promise
constituted
neither
a
gift
nor
a
regular
transfer
she
did
not
even
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
him
her
notion
being
that
the
law
was
unjust
it
was
because
she
was
a
woman
men
backed
up
each
other
amongst
themselves
in
the
end
however
she
followed
his
advice
he
made
himself
so
much
at
home
in
the
house
that
on
several
occasions
he
brought
sénécal
to
dine
there
frederick
who
had
advanced
him
money
and
even
got
his
own
tailor
to
supply
him
with
clothes
did
not
like
this
unceremoniousness
and
the
advocate
gave
his
old
clothes
to
the
socialist
whose
means
of
existence
were
now
of
an
exceedingly
uncertain
character
he
was
however
anxious
to
be
of
service
to
rosanette
one
day
when
she
showed
him
a
dozen
shares
in
the
kaolin
company
that
enterprise
which
led
to
arnoux
being
cast
in
damages
to
the
extent
of
thirty
thousand
francs
he
said
to
her
but
this
is
a
shady
transaction
and
you
have
now
a
grand
chance
she
had
the
right
to
call
on
him
to
pay
her
debts
in
the
first
place
she
could
prove
that
he
was
jointly
bound
to
pay
all
the
liabilities
since
he
had
certified
personal
debts
as
collective
debts
in
short
he
had
embezzled
sums
which
were
payable
only
to
the
company
all
this
renders
him
guilty
of
fraudulent
bankruptcy
under
articles
and
of
the
commercial
code
and
you
may
be
sure
my
pet
we
send
him
packing
rosanette
threw
herself
on
his
neck
he
entrusted
her
case
next
day
to
his
former
master
not
having
time
to
devote
attention
to
it
himself
as
he
had
business
at
nogent
in
case
of
any
urgency
sénécal
could
write
to
him
his
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
an
office
were
a
mere
pretext
he
spent
his
time
at
roque
house
where
he
had
begun
not
only
by
sounding
the
praises
of
their
friend
but
by
imitating
his
manners
and
language
as
much
as
possible
and
in
this
way
he
had
gained
confidence
while
he
won
over
that
of
her
father
by
making
an
attack
on
if
frederick
did
not
return
it
was
because
he
mingled
in
aristocratic
society
and
gradually
deslauriers
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
in
love
with
somebody
that
he
had
a
child
and
that
he
was
keeping
a
fallen
creature
the
despair
of
louise
was
intense
the
indignation
of
madame
moreau
was
not
less
strong
she
saw
her
son
whirling
towards
the
bottom
of
a
gulf
the
depth
of
which
could
not
be
determined
was
wounded
in
her
religious
ideas
as
to
propriety
and
as
it
were
experienced
a
sense
of
personal
dishonour
then
all
of
a
sudden
her
physiognomy
underwent
a
change
to
the
questions
which
people
put
to
her
with
regard
to
frederick
she
replied
in
a
sly
fashion
he
is
well
quite
well
she
was
aware
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
to
madame
dambreuse
the
date
of
the
event
had
been
fixed
and
he
was
even
trying
to
think
of
some
way
of
making
rosanette
swallow
the
thing
about
the
middle
of
autumn
she
won
her
action
with
reference
to
the
kaolin
shares
frederick
was
informed
about
it
by
sénécal
whom
he
met
at
his
own
door
on
his
way
back
from
the
courts
it
had
been
held
that
arnoux
was
privy
to
all
the
frauds
and
the
had
such
an
air
of
making
merry
over
it
that
frederick
prevented
him
from
coming
further
assuring
sénécal
that
he
would
convey
the
intelligence
to
rosanette
he
presented
himself
before
her
with
a
look
of
irritation
on
his
face
well
now
you
are
satisfied
but
without
minding
what
he
had
said
look
here
and
she
pointed
towards
her
child
which
was
lying
in
a
cradle
close
to
the
fire
she
had
found
it
so
sick
at
the
house
of
the
that
morning
that
she
had
brought
it
back
with
her
to
paris
all
the
infant
limbs
were
exceedingly
thin
and
the
lips
were
covered
with
white
specks
which
in
the
interior
of
the
mouth
became
so
to
speak
clots
of
milk
what
did
the
doctor
say
oh
the
doctor
he
pretends
that
the
journey
has
increased
his
i
know
what
it
is
some
name
in
in
short
that
he
has
the
thrush
l
do
you
know
what
that
is
frederick
replied
without
hesitation
certainly
adding
that
it
was
nothing
but
in
the
evening
he
was
alarmed
by
the
child
debilitated
look
and
by
the
progress
of
these
whitish
spots
resembling
mould
as
if
life
already
abandoning
this
little
frame
had
left
now
nothing
but
matter
from
which
vegetation
was
sprouting
his
hands
were
cold
he
was
no
longer
able
to
drink
anything
and
the
nurse
another
woman
whom
the
porter
had
gone
and
taken
on
chance
at
an
office
kept
repeating
it
seems
to
me
he
very
low
very
low
l
this
disease
consisting
of
ulceration
of
the
tongue
and
palate
is
also
called
translator
rosanette
was
up
all
night
with
the
child
in
the
morning
she
went
to
look
for
frederick
just
come
and
look
at
him
he
does
move
any
longer
in
fact
he
was
dead
she
took
him
up
shook
him
clasped
him
in
her
arms
calling
him
most
tender
names
covered
him
with
kisses
broke
into
sobs
turned
herself
from
one
side
to
the
other
in
a
state
of
distraction
tore
her
hair
uttered
a
number
of
shrieks
and
then
let
herself
sink
on
the
edge
of
the
divan
where
she
lay
with
her
mouth
open
and
a
flood
of
tears
rushing
from
her
eyes
then
a
torpor
fell
upon
her
and
all
became
still
in
the
apartment
the
furniture
was
overturned
two
or
three
napkins
were
lying
on
the
floor
it
struck
six
the
had
gone
out
frederick
as
he
gazed
at
the
scene
could
almost
believe
that
he
was
dreaming
his
heart
was
oppressed
with
anguish
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
death
was
only
a
beginning
and
that
behind
it
was
a
worse
calamity
which
was
just
about
to
come
on
suddenly
rosanette
said
in
an
appealing
tone
we
preserve
the
body
shall
we
not
she
wished
to
have
the
dead
child
embalmed
there
were
many
objections
to
this
the
principal
one
in
frederick
opinion
was
that
the
thing
was
impracticable
in
the
case
of
children
so
young
a
portrait
would
be
better
she
adopted
this
idea
he
wrote
a
line
to
pellerin
and
delphine
hastened
to
deliver
it
pellerin
arrived
speedily
anxious
by
this
display
of
zeal
to
efface
all
recollection
of
his
former
conduct
the
first
thing
he
said
was
poor
little
angel
ah
my
god
what
a
misfortune
but
gradually
the
artist
in
him
getting
the
upper
hand
he
declared
that
nothing
could
be
made
out
of
those
yellowish
eyes
that
livid
face
that
it
was
a
real
case
of
and
would
therefore
require
very
great
talent
to
treat
it
effectively
and
so
he
murmured
oh
is
easy
is
easy
no
matter
as
long
as
it
is
urged
rosanette
pooh
what
do
i
care
about
a
thing
being
down
with
realism
is
the
spirit
that
must
be
portrayed
by
the
painter
let
me
alone
i
am
going
to
try
to
conjure
up
what
it
ought
to
be
he
reflected
with
his
left
hand
clasping
his
brow
and
with
his
right
hand
clutching
his
elbow
then
all
of
a
sudden
ha
i
have
an
idea
a
pastel
with
coloured
mezzotints
almost
spread
out
flat
a
lovely
model
could
be
obtained
with
the
outer
surface
alone
he
sent
the
chambermaid
to
look
for
his
box
of
colours
then
having
a
chair
under
his
feet
and
another
by
his
side
he
began
to
throw
out
great
touches
with
as
much
complacency
as
if
he
had
drawn
them
in
accordance
with
the
bust
he
praised
the
little
saint
john
of
correggio
the
infanta
rosa
of
velasquez
the
of
reynolds
the
distinction
of
lawrence
and
especially
the
child
with
long
hair
that
sits
in
lady
gower
lap
besides
could
you
find
anything
more
charming
than
these
little
toads
the
type
of
the
sublime
raphael
has
proved
it
by
his
madonnas
is
probably
a
mother
with
her
child
rosanette
who
felt
herself
stifling
went
away
and
presently
pellerin
said
well
about
arnoux
you
know
what
has
happened
no
what
however
it
was
bound
to
end
that
way
what
has
happened
might
i
ask
perhaps
by
this
time
he
is
excuse
me
the
artist
got
up
in
order
to
raise
the
head
of
the
little
corpse
higher
you
were
saying
frederick
resumed
and
pellerin
his
eyes
in
order
to
take
his
dimensions
better
i
was
saying
that
our
friend
arnoux
is
perhaps
by
this
time
locked
up
then
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
just
give
a
little
glance
at
it
is
that
the
thing
yes
is
quite
right
but
about
arnoux
pellerin
laid
down
his
pencil
as
far
as
i
could
understand
he
was
sued
by
one
mignot
an
intimate
friend
of
regimbart
a
fellow
that
eh
what
an
idiot
just
imagine
one
day
what
it
not
regimbart
that
in
question
is
it
it
is
indeed
well
yesterday
evening
arnoux
had
to
produce
twelve
thousand
francs
if
not
he
was
a
ruined
man
oh
this
perhaps
is
exaggerated
said
frederick
not
a
bit
it
looked
to
me
a
very
serious
business
very
serious
at
that
moment
rosanette
reappeared
with
red
spots
under
her
eyes
which
glowed
like
dabs
of
paint
she
sat
down
near
the
drawing
and
gazed
at
it
pellerin
made
a
sign
to
the
other
to
hold
his
tongue
on
account
of
her
but
frederick
without
minding
her
nevertheless
i
ca
believe
i
tell
you
i
met
him
yesterday
said
the
artist
at
seven
in
the
evening
in
the
rue
jacob
he
had
even
taken
the
precaution
to
have
his
passport
with
him
and
he
spoke
about
embarking
from
havre
he
and
his
whole
camp
what
with
his
wife
no
doubt
he
is
too
much
of
a
family
man
to
live
by
himself
and
are
you
sure
of
this
certain
faith
where
do
you
expect
him
to
find
twelve
thousand
francs
frederick
took
two
or
three
turns
round
the
room
he
panted
for
breath
bit
his
lips
and
then
snatched
up
his
hat
where
are
you
going
now
said
rosanette
he
made
no
reply
and
the
next
moment
he
had
disappeared
chapter
xviii
an
auction
twelve
thousand
francs
should
be
procured
or
if
not
he
would
see
madame
arnoux
no
more
and
until
now
there
had
lingered
in
his
breast
an
unconquerable
hope
did
she
not
as
it
were
constitute
the
very
substance
of
his
heart
the
very
basis
of
his
life
for
some
minutes
he
went
staggering
along
the
footpath
his
mind
tortured
with
anxiety
and
nevertheless
gladdened
by
the
thought
that
he
was
no
longer
by
the
other
side
where
was
he
to
get
the
money
frederick
was
well
aware
from
his
own
experience
how
hard
it
was
to
obtain
it
immediately
no
matter
at
what
cost
there
was
only
one
person
who
could
help
him
in
the
matter
madame
dambreuse
she
always
kept
a
good
supply
of
in
her
escritoire
he
called
at
her
house
and
in
an
unblushing
fashion
have
you
twelve
thousand
francs
to
lend
me
what
for
that
was
another
person
secret
she
wanted
to
know
who
this
person
was
he
would
not
give
way
on
this
point
they
were
equally
determined
not
to
yield
finally
she
declared
that
she
would
give
nothing
until
she
knew
for
what
purpose
it
was
wanted
frederick
face
became
very
flushed
and
he
stated
that
one
of
his
comrades
had
committed
a
theft
it
was
necessary
to
replace
the
sum
this
very
day
let
me
know
his
name
his
name
come
what
his
name
dussardier
and
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
imploring
of
her
to
say
nothing
about
it
what
idea
have
you
got
into
your
head
about
me
madame
dambreuse
replied
one
would
imagine
that
you
were
the
guilty
party
yourself
pray
have
done
with
your
tragic
airs
hold
on
here
the
money
and
much
good
may
it
do
him
he
hurried
off
to
see
arnoux
that
worthy
merchant
was
not
in
his
shop
but
he
was
still
residing
in
the
rue
de
paradis
for
he
had
two
domiciles
in
the
rue
de
paradis
the
porter
said
that
arnoux
had
been
away
since
the
evening
before
as
for
madame
he
ventured
to
say
nothing
and
frederick
having
rushed
like
an
arrow
up
the
stairs
laid
his
ear
against
the
keyhole
at
length
the
door
was
opened
madame
had
gone
out
with
monsieur
the
servant
could
not
say
when
they
would
be
back
her
wages
had
been
paid
and
she
was
leaving
herself
suddenly
he
heard
the
door
creaking
but
is
there
anyone
in
the
room
oh
no
monsieur
it
is
the
wind
thereupon
he
withdrew
there
was
something
inexplicable
in
such
a
rapid
disappearance
regimbart
being
mignot
intimate
friend
could
perhaps
enlighten
him
and
frederick
got
himself
driven
to
that
gentleman
house
at
montmartre
in
the
rue
attached
to
the
house
there
was
a
small
garden
shut
in
by
a
grating
which
was
stopped
up
with
iron
plates
three
steps
before
the
set
off
the
white
front
and
a
person
passing
along
the
footpath
could
see
the
two
rooms
on
the
the
first
of
which
was
a
parlour
with
ladies
dresses
lying
on
the
furniture
on
every
side
and
the
second
the
workshop
in
which
madame
regimbart
female
assistants
were
accustomed
to
sit
they
were
all
convinced
that
monsieur
had
important
occupations
distinguished
connections
that
he
was
a
man
altogether
beyond
comparison
when
he
was
passing
through
the
lobby
with
his
hat
cocked
up
at
the
sides
his
long
grave
face
and
his
green
the
girls
stopped
in
the
midst
of
their
work
besides
he
never
failed
to
address
to
them
a
few
words
of
encouragement
some
observation
which
showed
his
ceremonious
courtesy
and
afterwards
in
their
own
homes
they
felt
unhappy
at
not
having
been
able
to
preserve
him
as
their
ideal
no
one
however
was
so
devoted
to
him
as
madame
regimbart
an
intelligent
little
woman
who
maintained
him
by
her
handicraft
as
soon
as
moreau
had
given
his
name
she
came
out
quickly
to
meet
him
knowing
through
the
servants
what
his
relations
were
with
madame
dambreuse
her
husband
would
be
back
in
a
moment
and
frederick
while
he
followed
her
admired
the
appearance
of
the
house
and
the
profusion
of
that
was
displayed
in
it
then
he
waited
a
few
minutes
in
a
kind
of
office
into
which
the
citizen
was
in
the
habit
of
retiring
in
order
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
when
they
met
regimbart
manner
was
less
cranky
than
usual
he
related
arnoux
recent
history
the
of
earthenware
had
excited
the
vanity
of
mignot
a
patriot
who
owned
a
hundred
shares
in
the
by
professing
to
show
that
it
would
be
necessary
from
the
democratic
standpoint
to
change
the
management
and
the
editorship
of
the
newspaper
and
under
the
pretext
of
making
his
views
prevail
in
the
next
meeting
of
shareholders
he
had
given
the
other
fifty
shares
telling
him
that
he
could
pass
them
on
to
reliable
friends
who
would
back
up
his
vote
mignot
would
have
no
personal
responsibility
and
need
not
annoy
himself
about
anyone
then
when
he
had
achieved
success
he
would
be
able
to
secure
a
good
place
in
the
administration
of
at
least
from
five
to
six
thousand
francs
the
shares
had
been
delivered
but
arnoux
had
at
once
sold
them
and
with
the
money
had
entered
into
partnership
with
a
dealer
in
religious
articles
thereupon
came
complaints
from
mignot
to
which
arnoux
sent
evasive
answers
at
last
the
patriot
had
threatened
to
bring
against
him
a
charge
of
cheating
if
he
did
not
restore
his
or
pay
an
equivalent
sum
fifty
thousand
francs
frederick
face
wore
a
look
of
despondency
that
is
not
the
whole
of
it
said
the
citizen
mignot
who
is
an
honest
fellow
has
reduced
his
claim
to
one
fourth
new
promises
on
the
part
of
the
other
and
of
course
new
dodges
in
short
on
the
morning
of
the
day
before
yesterday
mignot
sent
him
a
written
application
to
pay
up
within
hours
twelve
thousand
francs
without
prejudice
to
the
balance
but
i
have
the
amount
said
frederick
the
citizen
slowly
turned
round
humbug
excuse
me
i
have
the
money
in
my
pocket
i
brought
it
with
me
how
you
do
go
at
it
by
jove
you
do
however
is
too
late
now
the
complaint
has
been
lodged
and
arnoux
is
gone
alone
no
along
with
his
wife
they
were
seen
at
the
havre
terminus
frederick
grew
exceedingly
pale
madame
regimbart
thought
he
was
going
to
faint
he
regained
his
with
an
effort
and
had
even
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
ask
two
or
three
questions
about
the
occurrence
regimbart
was
grieved
at
the
affair
considering
that
it
would
injure
the
cause
of
democracy
arnoux
had
always
been
lax
in
his
conduct
and
disorderly
in
his
life
a
regular
fellow
he
burned
the
candle
at
both
ends
the
petticoat
has
ruined
him
is
not
himself
that
i
pity
but
his
poor
wife
for
the
citizen
admired
virtuous
women
and
had
a
great
esteem
for
madame
arnoux
she
must
have
suffered
a
nice
lot
frederick
felt
grateful
to
him
for
his
sympathy
and
as
if
regimbart
had
done
him
a
service
pressed
his
hand
effusively
have
you
done
all
that
necessary
in
the
matter
was
greeting
to
him
when
she
saw
him
again
he
had
not
been
able
to
pluck
up
courage
to
do
it
he
answered
and
walked
about
the
streets
at
random
to
divert
his
thoughts
at
eight
they
passed
into
the
but
they
remained
seated
face
to
face
in
silence
gave
vent
each
to
a
deep
sigh
every
now
and
then
and
pushed
away
their
plates
frederick
drank
some
brandy
he
felt
quite
shattered
crushed
annihilated
no
longer
conscious
of
anything
save
a
sensation
of
extreme
fatigue
she
went
to
look
at
the
portrait
the
red
the
yellow
the
green
and
the
indigo
made
glaring
stains
that
jarred
with
each
other
so
that
it
looked
a
hideous
thing
almost
ridiculous
besides
the
dead
child
was
now
unrecognisable
the
purple
hue
of
his
lips
made
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
more
remarkable
his
nostrils
were
more
drawn
than
before
his
eyes
more
hollow
and
his
head
rested
on
a
pillow
of
blue
taffeta
surrounded
by
petals
of
camelias
autumn
roses
and
violets
this
was
an
idea
suggested
by
the
chambermaid
and
both
of
them
had
thus
with
pious
care
arranged
the
little
corpse
the
mantelpiece
covered
with
a
cloth
of
guipure
supported
candlesticks
with
bunches
of
consecrated
box
in
the
spaces
between
them
at
the
corners
there
were
a
pair
of
vases
in
which
pastilles
were
burning
all
these
things
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
cradle
presented
the
aspect
of
an
altar
and
frederick
recalled
to
mind
the
night
when
he
had
watched
beside
dambreuse
nearly
every
quarter
of
an
hour
rosanette
drew
aside
the
curtains
in
order
to
take
a
look
at
her
child
she
saw
him
in
imagination
a
few
months
hence
beginning
to
walk
then
at
college
in
the
middle
of
the
playing
a
game
of
base
then
at
twenty
years
a
young
man
and
all
these
pictures
conjured
up
by
her
brain
created
for
her
as
it
were
the
son
she
would
have
lost
had
he
only
lived
the
excess
of
her
grief
intensifying
in
her
the
maternal
instinct
frederick
sitting
motionless
in
another
armchair
was
thinking
of
madame
arnoux
no
doubt
she
was
at
that
moment
in
a
train
with
her
face
leaning
against
a
carriage
window
while
she
watched
the
country
disappearing
behind
her
in
the
direction
of
paris
or
else
on
the
deck
of
a
steamboat
as
on
the
occasion
when
they
first
met
but
this
vessel
carried
her
away
into
distant
countries
from
which
she
would
never
return
he
next
saw
her
in
a
room
at
an
inn
with
trunks
covering
the
floor
the
hanging
in
shreds
and
the
door
shaking
in
the
wind
and
after
that
to
what
would
she
be
compelled
to
turn
would
she
have
to
become
a
or
a
lady
companion
or
perhaps
a
chambermaid
she
was
exposed
to
all
the
vicissitudes
of
poverty
his
utter
ignorance
as
to
what
her
fate
might
be
tortured
his
mind
he
ought
either
to
have
opposed
her
departure
or
to
have
followed
her
was
he
not
her
real
husband
and
as
the
thought
impressed
itself
on
his
consciousness
that
he
would
never
meet
her
again
that
it
was
all
over
forever
that
she
was
lost
to
him
beyond
recall
he
felt
so
to
speak
a
rending
of
his
entire
being
and
the
tears
that
had
been
gathering
since
morning
in
his
heart
overflowed
rosanette
noticed
the
tears
in
his
eyes
ah
you
are
crying
just
like
me
you
are
grieving
too
yes
yes
i
am
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
they
both
sobbed
locked
in
each
other
arms
madame
dambreuse
was
weeping
too
as
she
lay
face
downwards
on
her
bed
with
her
hands
clasped
over
her
head
olympe
regimbart
having
come
that
evening
to
try
on
her
first
coloured
gown
after
mourning
had
told
her
about
frederick
visit
and
even
about
the
twelve
thousand
francs
which
he
had
ready
to
transfer
to
arnoux
so
then
this
money
the
very
money
which
he
had
got
from
her
was
intended
to
be
used
simply
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
other
from
leaving
paris
for
the
purpose
in
fact
of
preserving
a
mistress
at
first
she
broke
into
a
violent
rage
and
determined
to
drive
him
from
her
door
as
she
would
have
driven
a
lackey
a
copious
flow
of
tears
produced
a
soothing
effect
upon
her
it
was
better
to
keep
it
all
to
herself
and
say
nothing
about
it
frederick
brought
her
back
the
twelve
thousand
francs
on
the
following
day
she
begged
of
him
to
keep
the
money
lest
he
might
require
it
for
his
friend
and
she
asked
a
number
of
questions
about
this
gentleman
who
then
had
tempted
him
to
such
a
breach
of
trust
a
woman
no
doubt
women
drag
you
into
every
kind
of
crime
this
bantering
tone
put
frederick
out
of
countenance
he
felt
deep
remorse
for
the
calumny
he
had
invented
he
was
reassured
by
the
reflection
that
madame
dambreuse
could
not
be
aware
of
the
facts
all
the
same
she
was
very
persistent
about
the
subject
for
two
days
later
she
again
made
enquiries
about
his
young
friend
and
after
that
about
another
deslauriers
is
this
young
man
trustworthy
and
intelligent
frederick
spoke
highly
of
him
ask
him
to
call
on
me
one
of
these
mornings
i
want
to
consult
him
about
a
matter
of
business
she
had
found
a
roll
of
old
papers
in
which
there
were
some
bills
of
arnoux
which
had
been
duly
protested
and
which
had
been
signed
by
madame
arnoux
it
was
about
these
very
bills
frederick
had
called
on
dambreuse
on
one
occasion
while
the
latter
was
at
breakfast
and
although
the
capitalist
had
not
sought
to
enforce
repayment
of
this
outstanding
debt
he
had
not
only
got
judgment
on
foot
of
them
from
the
tribunal
of
commerce
against
arnoux
but
also
against
his
wife
who
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
as
her
husband
had
not
thought
fit
to
give
her
any
information
on
the
point
here
was
a
weapon
placed
in
madame
dambreuse
hands
she
had
no
doubt
about
it
but
her
notary
would
advise
her
to
take
no
step
in
the
affair
she
would
have
preferred
to
act
through
some
obscure
person
and
she
thought
of
that
big
fellow
with
such
an
impudent
expression
of
face
who
had
offered
her
his
services
frederick
ingenuously
performed
this
commission
for
her
the
advocate
was
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
having
business
relations
with
such
an
aristocratic
lady
he
hurried
to
madame
dambreuse
house
she
informed
him
that
the
inheritance
belonged
to
her
niece
a
further
reason
for
liquidating
those
debts
which
she
should
repay
her
object
being
to
overwhelm
martinon
wife
by
a
display
of
greater
attention
to
the
deceased
affairs
deslauriers
guessed
that
there
was
some
hidden
design
underlying
all
this
he
reflected
while
he
was
examining
the
bills
madame
name
traced
by
her
own
hand
brought
once
more
before
his
eyes
her
entire
person
and
the
insult
which
he
had
received
at
her
hands
since
vengeance
was
offered
to
him
why
should
he
not
snatch
at
it
he
accordingly
advised
madame
dambreuse
to
have
the
bad
debts
which
went
with
the
inheritance
sold
by
auction
a
man
of
straw
whose
name
would
not
be
divulged
would
buy
them
up
and
would
exercise
the
legal
rights
thus
given
him
to
realise
them
he
would
take
it
on
himself
to
provide
a
man
to
discharge
this
function
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
november
frederick
happening
to
pass
through
the
street
in
which
madame
arnoux
had
lived
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
windows
of
her
house
and
saw
posted
on
the
door
a
placard
on
which
was
printed
in
large
letters
sale
of
valuable
furniture
consisting
of
kitchen
utensils
body
and
table
linen
shirts
and
chemises
lace
petticoats
trousers
french
and
indian
cashmeres
an
erard
piano
two
renaissance
oak
chests
venetian
mirrors
chinese
and
japanese
pottery
is
their
furniture
said
frederick
to
himself
and
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
by
the
doorkeeper
as
for
the
person
who
had
given
instructions
for
the
sale
he
could
get
no
information
on
that
head
but
perhaps
the
auctioneer
maître
berthelmot
might
be
able
to
throw
light
on
the
subject
the
functionary
did
not
at
first
want
to
tell
what
creditor
was
having
the
sale
carried
out
frederick
pressed
him
on
the
point
it
was
a
gentleman
named
sénécal
an
agent
and
maître
berthelmot
even
carried
his
politeness
so
far
as
to
lend
his
newspaper
the
to
frederick
the
latter
on
reaching
rosanette
house
flung
down
this
paper
on
the
table
spread
wide
open
read
that
well
what
said
she
with
a
face
so
calm
that
it
roused
up
in
him
a
feeling
of
revolt
ah
keep
up
that
air
of
innocence
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
is
you
who
are
selling
out
madame
arnoux
yourself
she
read
over
the
announcement
again
where
is
her
name
oh
is
her
furniture
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
what
does
that
signify
to
me
said
rosanette
shrugging
her
shoulders
what
does
it
signify
to
you
but
you
are
taking
your
revenge
all
this
is
the
consequence
of
your
persecutions
have
you
outraged
her
so
far
as
to
call
at
her
house
you
a
worthless
creature
and
this
to
the
most
saintly
the
most
charming
the
best
woman
that
ever
lived
why
do
you
set
your
heart
on
ruining
her
i
assure
you
you
are
mistaken
come
now
as
if
you
had
not
put
sénécal
forward
to
do
this
what
nonsense
then
he
was
carried
away
with
rage
you
lie
you
lie
you
wretch
you
are
jealous
of
her
you
have
got
a
judgment
against
her
husband
sénécal
is
already
mixed
up
in
your
affairs
he
detests
arnoux
and
your
two
hatreds
have
entered
into
a
combination
with
one
another
i
saw
how
delighted
he
was
when
you
won
that
action
of
yours
about
the
kaolin
shares
are
you
going
to
deny
this
i
give
you
my
word
oh
i
know
what
that
worth
your
word
and
frederick
reminded
her
of
her
lovers
giving
their
names
and
circumstantial
details
rosanette
drew
back
all
the
colour
fading
from
her
face
you
are
astonished
at
this
you
thought
i
was
blind
because
i
shut
my
eyes
now
i
have
had
enough
of
it
we
do
not
die
through
the
treacheries
of
a
woman
of
your
sort
when
they
become
too
monstrous
we
get
out
of
the
way
to
inflict
punishment
on
account
of
them
would
be
only
to
degrade
oneself
she
twisted
her
arms
about
my
god
who
can
it
be
that
has
changed
him
nobody
but
yourself
and
all
this
for
madame
arnoux
exclaimed
rosanette
weeping
he
replied
coldly
i
have
never
loved
any
woman
but
her
at
this
insult
her
tears
ceased
to
flow
that
shows
your
good
taste
a
woman
of
mature
years
with
a
complexion
like
liquorice
a
thick
waist
big
eyes
like
the
ventholes
of
a
cellar
and
just
as
empty
as
you
like
her
so
much
go
and
join
her
this
is
just
what
i
expected
thank
you
rosanette
remained
motionless
stupefied
by
this
extraordinary
behaviour
she
even
allowed
the
door
to
be
shut
then
with
a
bound
she
pulled
him
back
into
the
anteroom
and
flinging
her
arms
around
him
why
you
are
mad
you
are
mad
this
is
absurd
i
love
you
then
she
changed
her
tone
to
one
of
entreaty
good
heavens
for
the
sake
of
our
dead
infant
confess
that
it
was
you
who
did
this
trick
said
frederick
she
still
protested
that
she
was
innocent
you
will
not
acknowledge
it
no
well
then
farewell
and
forever
listen
to
me
frederick
turned
round
if
you
understood
me
better
you
would
know
that
my
decision
is
irrevocable
oh
oh
you
will
come
back
to
me
again
never
as
long
as
i
live
and
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
violently
rosanette
wrote
to
deslauriers
saying
that
she
wanted
to
see
him
at
once
he
called
one
evening
about
five
days
later
and
when
she
told
him
about
the
rupture
that
all
a
nice
piece
of
bad
luck
she
thought
at
first
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
bring
back
frederick
but
now
all
was
lost
she
ascertained
through
the
doorkeeper
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
to
madame
dambreuse
deslauriers
gave
her
a
lecture
and
showed
himself
an
exceedingly
gay
fellow
quite
a
jolly
dog
and
as
it
was
very
late
asked
permission
to
pass
the
night
in
an
armchair
then
next
morning
he
set
out
again
for
nogent
informing
her
that
he
was
unable
to
say
when
they
would
meet
once
more
in
a
little
while
there
would
perhaps
be
a
great
change
in
his
life
two
hours
after
his
return
the
town
was
in
a
state
of
revolution
the
news
went
round
that
frederick
was
going
to
marry
madame
dambreuse
at
length
the
three
mesdemoiselles
auger
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
made
their
way
to
the
house
of
madame
moreau
who
with
an
air
of
pride
confirmed
this
intelligence
père
roque
became
quite
ill
when
he
heard
it
louise
locked
herself
up
it
was
even
rumoured
that
she
had
gone
mad
meanwhile
frederick
was
unable
to
hide
his
dejection
madame
dambreuse
in
order
to
divert
his
mind
no
doubt
from
gloomy
thoughts
redoubled
her
attentions
every
afternoon
they
went
out
for
a
drive
in
her
carriage
and
on
one
occasion
as
they
were
passing
along
the
place
de
la
bourse
she
took
the
idea
into
her
head
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
public
for
the
sake
of
amusement
it
was
the
of
december
the
very
day
on
which
the
sale
of
madame
arnoux
furniture
was
to
take
place
he
remembered
the
date
and
manifested
his
repugnance
declaring
that
this
place
was
intolerable
on
account
of
the
crush
and
the
noise
she
only
wanted
to
get
a
peep
at
it
the
brougham
drew
up
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
accompany
her
in
the
open
space
could
be
seen
without
basins
the
wooden
portions
of
armchairs
old
hampers
pieces
of
porcelain
empty
bottles
mattresses
and
men
in
blouses
or
in
dirty
all
grey
with
dust
and
faces
some
with
canvas
sacks
over
their
shoulders
were
chatting
in
separate
groups
or
hailing
each
other
in
a
disorderly
fashion
frederick
urged
that
it
was
inconvenient
to
go
on
any
further
pooh
and
they
ascended
the
stairs
in
the
first
room
at
the
right
gentlemen
with
catalogues
in
their
hands
were
examining
pictures
in
another
a
collection
of
chinese
weapons
were
being
sold
madame
dambreuse
wanted
to
go
down
again
she
looked
at
the
numbers
over
the
doors
and
she
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
towards
an
apartment
which
was
blocked
up
with
people
he
immediately
recognised
the
two
whatnots
belonging
to
the
office
of
her
all
her
furniture
heaped
up
at
the
end
of
the
room
according
to
their
respective
heights
they
formed
a
long
slope
from
the
floor
to
the
windows
and
at
the
other
sides
of
the
apartment
the
carpets
and
the
curtains
hung
down
straight
along
the
walls
there
were
underneath
steps
occupied
by
old
men
who
had
fallen
asleep
at
the
left
rose
a
sort
of
counter
at
which
the
auctioneer
in
a
white
cravat
was
lightly
swinging
a
little
hammer
by
his
side
a
young
man
was
writing
and
below
him
stood
a
sturdy
fellow
between
a
commercial
traveller
and
a
vendor
of
countermarks
crying
out
furniture
for
sale
three
attendants
placed
the
articles
on
a
table
at
the
sides
of
which
sat
in
a
row
dealers
and
women
the
general
public
at
the
auction
kept
walking
in
a
circle
behind
them
when
frederick
came
in
the
petticoats
the
neckerchiefs
and
even
the
chemises
were
being
passed
on
from
hand
to
hand
and
then
given
back
sometimes
they
were
flung
some
distance
and
suddenly
strips
of
whiteness
went
flying
through
the
air
after
that
her
gowns
were
sold
and
then
one
of
her
hats
the
broken
feather
of
which
was
hanging
down
then
her
furs
and
then
three
pairs
of
boots
and
the
disposal
by
sale
of
these
relics
wherein
he
could
trace
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
the
very
outlines
of
her
form
appeared
to
him
an
atrocity
as
if
he
had
seen
carrion
crows
mangling
her
corpse
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
heavy
with
so
many
breaths
made
him
feel
sick
madame
dambreuse
offered
him
her
she
said
that
she
found
all
this
highly
amusing
the
bedroom
furniture
was
now
exhibited
maître
berthelmot
named
a
price
the
crier
immediately
repeated
it
in
a
louder
voice
and
the
three
auctioneer
assistants
quietly
waited
for
the
stroke
of
the
hammer
and
then
carried
off
the
article
sold
to
an
adjoining
apartment
in
this
way
disappeared
one
after
the
other
the
large
blue
carpet
spangled
with
camellias
which
her
dainty
feet
used
to
touch
so
lightly
as
she
advanced
to
meet
him
the
little
upholstered
in
which
he
used
to
sit
facing
her
when
they
were
alone
together
the
two
screens
belonging
to
the
mantelpiece
the
ivory
of
which
had
been
rendered
smoother
by
the
touch
of
her
hands
and
a
velvet
pincushion
which
was
still
bristling
with
pins
it
was
as
if
portions
of
his
heart
had
been
carried
away
with
these
things
and
the
monotony
of
the
same
voices
and
the
same
gestures
benumbed
him
with
fatigue
and
caused
within
him
a
mournful
torpor
a
sensation
like
that
of
death
itself
there
was
a
rustle
of
silk
close
to
his
ear
rosanette
touched
him
it
was
through
frederick
himself
that
she
had
learned
about
this
auction
when
her
first
feelings
of
vexation
was
over
the
idea
of
deriving
profit
from
it
occurred
to
her
mind
she
had
come
to
see
it
in
a
white
satin
vest
with
pearl
buttons
a
furbelowed
gown
gloves
on
her
hands
and
a
look
of
triumph
on
her
face
he
grew
pale
with
anger
she
stared
at
the
woman
who
was
by
his
side
madame
dambreuse
had
recognised
her
and
for
a
minute
they
examined
each
other
from
head
to
foot
minutely
in
order
to
discover
the
defect
the
blemish
the
one
perhaps
envying
the
other
youth
and
the
other
filled
with
spite
at
the
extreme
good
form
the
aristocratic
simplicity
of
her
rival
at
last
madame
dambreuse
turned
her
head
round
with
a
smile
of
inexpressible
insolence
the
crier
had
opened
a
piano
her
piano
while
he
remained
standing
before
it
he
ran
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
over
the
keys
and
put
up
the
instrument
at
twelve
hundred
francs
then
he
brought
down
the
figures
to
one
thousand
then
to
eight
hundred
and
finally
to
seven
hundred
madame
dambreuse
in
a
playful
tone
laughed
at
the
appearance
of
some
socket
that
was
out
of
gear
the
next
thing
placed
before
the
dealers
was
a
little
chest
with
medallions
and
silver
corners
and
clasps
the
same
one
which
he
had
seen
at
the
first
dinner
in
the
rue
de
choiseul
which
had
subsequently
been
in
rosanette
house
and
again
transferred
back
to
madame
residence
often
during
their
conversations
his
eyes
wandered
towards
it
he
was
bound
to
it
by
the
dearest
memories
and
his
soul
was
melting
with
tender
emotions
about
it
when
suddenly
madame
dambreuse
said
look
here
i
am
going
to
buy
that
but
it
is
not
a
very
rare
article
he
returned
she
considered
it
on
the
contrary
very
pretty
and
the
appraiser
commended
its
delicacy
a
gem
of
the
renaissance
eight
hundred
francs
messieurs
almost
entirely
of
silver
with
a
little
whiting
it
can
be
made
to
shine
brilliantly
and
as
she
was
pushing
forward
through
the
crush
of
people
what
an
odd
idea
said
frederick
you
are
annoyed
at
this
no
but
what
can
be
done
with
a
fancy
article
of
that
sort
who
knows
might
be
kept
in
it
perhaps
she
gave
him
a
look
which
made
the
allusion
very
clear
a
reason
the
more
for
not
robbing
the
dead
of
their
secrets
i
did
not
imagine
she
was
dead
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
she
went
on
to
bid
eight
hundred
and
eighty
francs
what
you
doing
is
not
right
murmured
frederick
she
began
to
laugh
but
this
is
the
first
favour
dear
that
i
am
asking
from
you
come
now
does
it
strike
you
that
at
this
rate
you
wo
be
a
very
considerate
husband
some
one
had
just
at
that
moment
made
a
higher
bid
nine
hundred
francs
nine
hundred
francs
repeated
maître
berthelmot
nine
hundred
and
ten
fifteen
twenty
thirty
squeaked
the
auctioneer
crier
with
jerky
shakes
of
his
head
as
he
cast
a
sweeping
glance
at
those
assembled
around
him
show
me
that
i
am
going
to
have
a
wife
who
is
amenable
to
reason
said
frederick
and
he
gently
drew
her
towards
the
door
the
auctioneer
proceeded
come
come
messieurs
nine
hundred
and
thirty
is
there
any
bidder
at
nine
hundred
and
thirty
madame
dambreuse
just
as
she
had
reached
the
door
stopped
and
raising
her
voice
to
a
high
pitch
one
thousand
francs
there
was
a
thrill
of
astonishment
and
then
a
dead
silence
a
thousand
francs
messieurs
a
thousand
francs
is
nobody
advancing
on
this
bid
is
that
clear
very
well
then
one
thousand
francs
going
gone
and
down
came
the
ivory
hammer
she
passed
in
her
card
and
the
little
chest
was
handed
over
to
her
she
thrust
it
into
her
muff
frederick
felt
a
great
chill
penetrating
his
heart
madame
dambreuse
had
not
let
go
her
hold
of
his
arm
and
she
had
not
the
courage
to
look
up
at
his
face
in
the
street
where
her
carriage
was
awaiting
her
she
flung
herself
into
it
like
a
thief
flying
away
after
a
robbery
and
then
turned
towards
frederick
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
are
you
not
going
to
come
in
no
madame
and
bowing
to
her
frigidly
he
shut
the
and
then
made
a
sign
to
the
coachman
to
drive
away
the
first
feeling
that
he
experienced
was
one
of
joy
at
having
regained
his
independence
he
was
filled
with
pride
at
the
thought
that
he
had
avenged
madame
arnoux
by
sacrificing
a
fortune
to
her
then
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
act
and
he
felt
doubled
up
with
extreme
physical
exhaustion
next
morning
his
brought
him
the
news
the
city
had
been
declared
to
be
in
a
state
of
siege
the
assembly
had
been
dissolved
and
a
number
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
had
been
imprisoned
at
mazas
public
affairs
had
assumed
to
his
mind
an
utterly
unimportant
aspect
so
deeply
preoccupied
was
he
by
his
private
troubles
he
wrote
to
several
tradesmen
countermanding
various
orders
which
he
had
given
for
the
purchase
of
articles
in
connection
with
his
projected
marriage
which
now
appeared
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
rather
mean
speculation
and
he
execrated
madame
dambreuse
because
owing
to
her
he
had
been
very
near
perpetrating
a
vile
action
he
had
forgotten
the
maréchale
and
did
not
even
bother
himself
about
madame
arnoux
absorbed
only
in
one
thought
lost
amid
the
wreck
of
his
dreams
sick
at
heart
full
of
grief
and
disappointment
and
in
his
hatred
of
the
artificial
atmosphere
wherein
he
had
suffered
so
much
he
longed
for
the
freshness
of
green
fields
the
repose
of
provincial
life
a
sleeping
existence
spent
beneath
his
natal
roof
in
the
midst
of
ingenuous
hearts
at
last
when
wednesday
evening
arrived
he
made
his
way
out
into
the
open
air
on
the
boulevard
numerous
groups
had
taken
up
their
stand
from
time
to
time
a
patrol
came
and
dispersed
them
they
gathered
together
again
in
regular
order
behind
it
they
talked
freely
and
in
loud
tones
made
chaffing
remarks
about
the
soldiers
without
anything
further
happening
what
are
they
not
going
to
fight
said
frederick
to
a
workman
they
not
such
fools
as
to
get
themselves
killed
for
the
people
let
them
take
care
of
themselves
and
a
gentleman
muttered
as
he
glanced
across
at
the
inhabitants
of
the
faubourgs
socialist
rascals
if
it
were
only
possible
this
time
to
exterminate
them
frederick
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
understand
the
necessity
of
so
much
rancour
and
vituperative
language
his
feeling
of
disgust
against
paris
was
intensified
by
these
occurrences
and
two
days
later
he
set
out
for
nogent
by
the
first
train
the
houses
soon
became
lost
to
view
the
country
stretched
out
before
his
gaze
alone
in
his
carriage
with
his
feet
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
he
pondered
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
and
then
on
his
entire
past
the
recollection
of
louise
came
back
to
his
mind
she
indeed
loved
me
truly
i
was
wrong
not
to
snatch
at
this
chance
of
happiness
pooh
let
us
not
think
any
more
about
it
then
five
minutes
afterwards
who
knows
after
all
why
not
later
his
reverie
like
his
eyes
wandered
afar
towards
vague
horizons
she
was
artless
a
peasant
girl
almost
a
savage
but
so
good
in
proportion
as
he
drew
nearer
to
nogent
her
image
drew
closer
to
him
as
they
were
passing
through
the
meadows
of
sourdun
he
saw
her
once
more
in
imagination
under
the
as
in
the
old
days
cutting
rushes
on
the
edges
of
the
pools
and
now
they
had
reached
their
destination
he
stepped
out
of
the
train
then
he
leaned
with
his
elbows
on
the
bridge
to
gaze
again
at
the
isle
and
the
garden
where
they
had
walked
together
one
sunshiny
day
and
the
dizzy
sensation
caused
by
travelling
together
with
the
weakness
engendered
by
his
recent
emotions
arousing
in
his
breast
a
sort
of
exaltation
he
said
to
himself
she
has
gone
out
perhaps
suppose
i
were
to
go
and
meet
her
the
bell
of
was
ringing
and
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
church
there
was
a
crowd
of
poor
people
around
an
open
carriage
the
only
one
in
the
district
the
one
which
was
always
hired
for
weddings
and
all
of
a
sudden
under
the
accompanied
by
a
number
of
persons
in
white
cravats
a
couple
appeared
he
thought
he
must
be
labouring
under
some
hallucination
but
no
it
was
indeed
louise
covered
with
a
white
veil
which
flowed
from
her
red
hair
down
to
her
heels
and
with
her
was
no
other
than
deslauriers
attired
in
a
blue
coat
embroidered
with
silver
the
costume
of
a
prefect
how
was
this
frederick
concealed
himself
at
the
corner
of
a
house
to
let
the
procession
pass
shamefaced
vanquished
crushed
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
and
returned
to
paris
the
cabman
who
drove
him
assured
him
that
the
barricades
were
erected
from
the
château
to
the
gymnase
and
turned
down
the
faubourg
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
provence
frederick
stepped
out
in
order
to
reach
the
boulevards
it
was
five
a
thin
shower
was
falling
a
number
of
citizens
blocked
up
the
footpath
close
to
the
opera
house
the
houses
opposite
were
closed
no
one
at
any
of
the
windows
all
along
the
boulevard
dragoons
were
galloping
behind
a
row
of
wagons
leaning
with
drawn
swords
over
their
horses
and
the
plumes
of
their
helmets
and
their
large
white
cloaks
rising
up
behind
them
could
be
seen
under
the
glare
of
the
which
shook
in
the
wind
in
the
midst
of
a
haze
the
crowd
gazed
at
them
mute
with
fear
in
the
intervals
between
the
squads
of
policemen
arrived
on
the
scene
to
keep
back
the
people
in
the
streets
but
on
the
steps
of
tortoni
a
man
dussardier
who
could
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
by
his
great
height
remained
standing
as
motionless
as
a
caryatide
one
of
the
marching
at
the
head
of
his
men
with
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
threatened
him
with
his
sword
the
other
thereupon
took
one
step
forward
and
shouted
long
live
the
republic
the
next
moment
he
fell
on
his
back
with
his
arms
crossed
a
yell
of
horror
arose
from
the
crowd
the
with
a
look
of
command
made
a
circle
around
him
and
frederick
gazing
at
him
in
astonishment
recognised
sénécal
illustration
illustration
when
a
woman
suddenly
came
in
chapter
xix
a
reunion
he
travelled
he
realised
the
melancholy
associated
with
the
chill
one
feels
on
waking
up
under
tents
the
dizzy
effect
of
landscapes
and
ruins
and
the
bitterness
of
ruptured
sympathies
he
returned
home
he
mingled
in
society
and
he
conceived
attachments
to
other
women
but
the
constant
recollection
of
his
first
love
made
these
appear
insipid
and
besides
the
vehemence
of
desire
the
bloom
of
the
sensation
had
vanished
in
like
manner
his
intellectual
ambitions
had
grown
weaker
years
passed
and
he
was
forced
to
support
the
burthen
of
a
life
in
which
his
mind
was
unoccupied
and
his
heart
devoid
of
energy
towards
the
end
of
march
just
as
it
was
getting
dark
one
evening
he
was
sitting
all
alone
in
his
study
when
a
woman
suddenly
came
in
madame
arnoux
frederick
she
caught
hold
of
his
hands
and
drew
him
gently
towards
the
window
and
as
she
gazed
into
his
face
she
kept
repeating
is
he
yes
indeed
is
he
in
the
growing
shadows
of
the
twilight
he
could
see
only
her
eyes
under
the
black
lace
veil
that
hid
her
face
when
she
had
laid
down
on
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
a
little
bound
in
garnet
velvet
she
seated
herself
in
front
of
him
and
they
both
remained
silent
unable
to
utter
a
word
smiling
at
one
another
at
last
he
asked
her
a
number
of
questions
about
herself
and
her
husband
they
had
gone
to
live
in
a
remote
part
of
brittany
for
the
sake
of
economy
so
as
to
be
able
to
pay
their
debts
arnoux
now
almost
a
chronic
invalid
seemed
to
have
become
quite
an
old
man
her
daughter
had
been
married
and
was
living
at
bordeaux
and
her
son
was
in
garrison
at
mostaganem
then
she
raised
her
head
to
look
at
him
again
but
i
see
you
once
more
i
am
happy
he
did
not
fail
to
let
her
know
that
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
their
misfortune
he
had
hastened
to
their
house
i
was
fully
aware
of
it
how
she
had
seen
him
in
the
street
outside
the
house
and
had
hidden
herself
why
did
you
do
that
then
in
a
trembling
voice
and
with
long
pauses
between
her
words
i
was
afraid
yes
afraid
of
you
and
of
myself
this
disclosure
gave
him
as
it
were
a
shock
of
voluptuous
joy
his
heart
began
to
throb
wildly
she
went
on
excuse
me
for
not
having
come
sooner
and
pointing
towards
the
little
covered
with
golden
i
embroidered
it
on
your
account
expressly
it
contains
the
amount
for
which
the
belleville
property
was
given
as
security
frederick
thanked
her
for
letting
him
have
the
money
while
chiding
her
at
the
same
time
for
having
given
herself
any
trouble
about
it
no
is
not
for
this
i
came
i
was
determined
to
pay
you
this
visit
then
i
would
go
back
there
again
and
she
spoke
about
the
place
where
they
had
taken
up
their
abode
it
was
a
house
of
only
one
story
and
there
was
a
garden
attached
to
it
full
of
huge
and
a
double
avenue
of
reaching
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
from
which
there
was
a
view
of
the
sea
i
go
there
and
sit
down
on
a
bench
which
i
have
called
bench
then
she
proceeded
to
fix
her
gaze
on
the
furniture
the
objects
of
virtù
the
pictures
with
eager
intentness
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
carry
away
the
impressions
of
them
in
her
memory
the
portrait
was
behind
a
curtain
but
the
gilding
and
the
white
spaces
of
the
picture
which
showed
their
outlines
through
the
midst
of
the
surrounding
darkness
attracted
her
attention
it
seems
to
me
i
knew
that
woman
impossible
said
frederick
it
is
an
old
italian
painting
she
confessed
that
she
would
like
to
take
a
walk
through
the
streets
on
his
arm
they
went
out
the
light
from
the
fell
every
now
and
then
on
her
pale
profile
then
once
more
she
was
wrapped
in
shadow
and
in
the
midst
of
the
carriages
the
crowd
and
the
din
they
walked
on
without
paying
any
heed
to
what
was
happening
around
them
without
hearing
anything
like
those
who
make
their
way
across
the
fields
over
beds
of
dead
leaves
they
talked
about
the
days
which
they
had
formerly
spent
in
each
society
the
dinners
at
the
time
when
flourished
arnoux
fads
his
habit
of
drawing
up
the
ends
of
his
collar
and
of
squeezing
cosmetic
over
his
moustache
and
other
matters
of
a
more
intimate
and
serious
character
what
delight
he
experienced
on
the
first
occasion
when
he
heard
her
singing
how
lovely
she
looked
on
her
at
he
recalled
to
her
memory
the
little
garden
at
auteuil
evenings
at
the
theatre
a
chance
meeting
on
the
boulevard
and
some
of
her
old
servants
including
the
negress
she
was
astonished
at
his
vivid
recollection
of
these
things
sometimes
your
words
come
back
to
me
like
a
distant
echo
like
the
sound
of
a
bell
carried
on
by
the
wind
and
when
i
read
passages
about
love
in
books
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
about
you
i
am
reading
all
that
people
have
found
fault
with
as
exaggerated
in
fiction
you
have
made
me
feel
said
frederick
i
can
understand
werther
who
felt
no
disgust
at
his
charlotte
for
eating
bread
and
butter
poor
dear
friend
she
heaved
a
sigh
and
after
a
prolonged
silence
no
matter
we
shall
have
loved
each
other
truly
and
still
without
having
ever
belonged
to
each
other
this
perhaps
is
all
the
better
she
replied
no
no
what
happiness
we
might
have
enjoyed
oh
i
am
sure
of
it
with
a
love
like
yours
and
it
must
have
been
very
strong
to
endure
after
such
a
long
separation
frederick
wished
to
know
from
her
how
she
first
discovered
that
he
loved
her
it
was
when
you
kissed
my
wrist
one
evening
between
the
glove
and
the
cuff
i
said
to
myself
yes
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
nevertheless
i
was
afraid
of
being
assured
of
it
so
charming
was
your
reserve
that
i
felt
myself
the
object
as
it
were
of
an
involuntary
and
continuous
homage
he
regretted
nothing
now
he
was
compensated
for
all
he
had
suffered
in
the
past
when
they
came
back
to
the
house
madame
arnoux
took
off
her
bonnet
the
lamp
placed
on
a
bracket
threw
its
light
on
her
white
hair
frederick
felt
as
if
some
one
had
given
him
a
blow
in
the
middle
of
the
chest
in
order
to
conceal
from
her
his
sense
of
disillusion
he
flung
himself
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
and
seizing
her
hands
began
to
whisper
in
her
ear
words
of
tenderness
your
person
your
slightest
movements
seemed
to
me
to
have
a
more
than
human
importance
in
the
world
my
heart
was
like
dust
under
your
feet
you
produced
on
me
the
effect
of
moonlight
on
a
summer
night
when
around
us
we
find
nothing
but
perfumes
soft
shadows
gleams
of
whiteness
infinity
and
all
the
delights
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
spirit
were
for
me
embodied
in
your
name
which
i
kept
repeating
to
myself
while
i
tried
to
kiss
it
with
my
lips
i
thought
of
nothing
further
it
was
madame
arnoux
such
as
you
were
with
your
two
children
tender
grave
dazzlingly
beautiful
and
yet
so
good
this
image
effaced
every
other
did
i
not
think
of
it
alone
for
i
had
always
in
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
the
music
of
your
voice
and
the
brightness
of
your
eyes
she
accepted
with
transports
of
joy
these
tributes
of
adoration
to
the
woman
whom
she
could
no
longer
claim
to
be
frederick
becoming
intoxicated
with
his
own
words
came
to
believe
himself
in
the
reality
of
what
he
said
madame
arnoux
with
her
back
turned
to
the
light
of
the
lamp
stooped
towards
him
he
felt
the
caress
of
her
breath
on
his
forehead
and
the
undefined
touch
of
her
entire
body
through
the
garments
that
kept
them
apart
their
hands
were
clasped
the
tip
of
her
boot
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
gown
and
he
said
to
her
as
if
ready
to
faint
the
sight
of
your
foot
makes
me
lose
my
an
impulse
of
modesty
made
her
rise
then
without
any
further
movement
she
said
with
the
strange
intonation
of
a
somnambulist
at
my
age
he
frederick
ah
no
woman
has
ever
been
loved
as
i
have
been
no
where
is
the
use
in
being
young
what
do
i
care
about
them
indeed
i
despise
them
all
those
women
who
come
here
oh
very
few
women
come
to
this
place
he
returned
in
a
complaisant
fashion
her
face
brightened
up
and
then
she
asked
him
whether
he
meant
to
be
married
he
swore
that
he
never
would
are
you
perfectly
sure
why
should
you
not
is
on
your
account
said
frederick
clasping
her
in
his
arms
she
remained
thus
pressed
to
his
heart
with
her
head
thrown
back
her
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
raised
suddenly
she
pushed
him
away
from
her
with
a
look
of
despair
and
when
he
implored
of
her
to
say
something
to
him
in
reply
she
bent
forward
and
whispered
i
would
have
liked
to
make
you
happy
frederick
had
a
suspicion
that
madame
arnoux
had
come
to
offer
herself
to
him
and
once
more
he
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
possess
her
stronger
fiercer
more
desperate
than
he
had
ever
experienced
before
and
yet
he
felt
the
next
moment
an
unaccountable
repugnance
to
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
as
it
were
a
dread
of
incurring
the
guilt
of
incest
another
fear
too
had
a
different
effect
on
him
lest
disgust
might
afterwards
take
possession
of
him
besides
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
and
abandoning
the
idea
partly
through
prudence
and
partly
through
a
resolve
not
to
degrade
his
ideal
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
proceeded
to
roll
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
she
watched
him
with
admiration
how
dainty
you
are
there
is
no
one
like
you
there
is
no
one
like
you
it
struck
eleven
already
she
exclaimed
at
a
i
must
go
she
sat
down
again
but
she
kept
looking
at
the
clock
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
puffing
at
his
cigarette
neither
of
them
could
think
of
anything
further
to
say
to
the
other
there
is
a
moment
at
the
hour
of
parting
when
the
person
that
we
love
is
with
us
no
longer
at
last
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
got
past
the
minutes
she
slowly
took
up
her
bonnet
holding
it
by
the
strings
my
friend
my
dear
friend
i
shall
never
see
you
again
this
is
the
closing
page
in
my
life
as
a
woman
my
soul
shall
remain
with
you
even
when
you
see
me
no
more
may
all
the
blessings
of
heaven
be
yours
and
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
like
a
mother
but
she
appeared
to
be
looking
for
something
and
then
she
asked
him
for
a
pair
of
scissors
she
unfastened
her
comb
and
all
her
white
hair
fell
down
with
an
abrupt
movement
of
the
scissors
she
cut
off
a
long
lock
from
the
roots
keep
it
when
she
was
gone
frederick
rushed
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
there
on
the
footpath
he
saw
madame
arnoux
beckoning
towards
a
passing
cab
she
stepped
into
it
the
vehicle
disappeared
and
this
was
all
chapter
xx
wait
till
you
come
to
forty
year
about
the
beginning
of
this
winter
frederick
and
deslauriers
were
chatting
by
the
fireside
once
more
reconciled
by
the
fatality
of
their
nature
which
made
them
always
reunite
and
be
friends
again
frederick
briefly
explained
his
quarrel
with
madame
dambreuse
who
had
married
again
her
second
husband
being
an
englishman
deslauriers
without
telling
how
he
had
come
to
marry
mademoiselle
roque
related
to
his
friend
how
his
wife
had
one
day
eloped
with
a
singer
in
order
to
wipe
away
to
some
extent
the
ridicule
that
this
brought
upon
him
he
had
compromised
himself
by
an
excess
of
governmental
zeal
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
as
prefect
he
had
been
dismissed
after
that
he
had
been
an
agent
for
colonisation
in
algeria
secretary
to
a
pasha
editor
of
a
newspaper
and
canvasser
for
advertisements
his
latest
employment
being
the
office
of
settling
disputed
cases
for
a
manufacturing
company
as
for
frederick
having
squandered
two
thirds
of
his
means
he
was
now
living
like
a
citizen
of
comparatively
humble
rank
then
they
questioned
each
other
about
their
friends
martinon
was
now
a
member
of
the
senate
hussonnet
occupied
a
high
position
in
which
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
all
the
theatres
and
entire
press
dependent
upon
him
cisy
given
up
to
religion
and
the
father
of
eight
children
was
living
in
the
château
of
his
ancestors
pellerin
after
turning
his
hand
to
fourrièrism
homoeopathy
gothic
art
and
humanitarian
painting
had
become
a
photographer
and
he
was
to
be
seen
on
every
dead
wall
in
paris
where
he
was
represented
in
a
black
coat
with
a
very
small
body
and
a
big
head
and
what
about
your
chum
sénécal
asked
frederick
disappeared
i
ca
tell
you
where
and
yourself
what
about
the
woman
you
were
so
passionately
attached
to
madame
arnoux
she
is
probably
at
rome
with
her
son
a
lieutenant
of
chasseurs
and
her
husband
he
died
a
year
ago
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
the
advocate
then
striking
his
forehead
now
that
i
think
of
it
the
other
day
in
a
shop
i
met
that
worthy
maréchale
holding
by
the
hand
a
little
boy
whom
she
has
adopted
she
is
the
widow
of
a
certain
oudry
and
is
now
enormously
stout
what
a
change
for
the
worse
she
who
formerly
had
such
a
slender
waist
deslauriers
did
not
deny
that
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
despair
to
assure
himself
of
that
fact
by
personal
experience
as
you
gave
me
permission
however
this
avowal
was
a
compensation
for
the
silence
he
had
maintained
with
reference
to
his
attempt
with
madame
arnoux
frederick
would
have
forgiven
him
inasmuch
as
he
had
not
succeeded
in
the
attempt
although
a
little
annoyed
at
the
discovery
he
pretended
to
laugh
at
it
and
the
allusion
to
the
maréchale
brought
back
the
vatnaz
to
his
recollection
deslauriers
had
never
seen
her
any
more
than
the
others
who
used
to
come
to
the
arnoux
house
but
he
remembered
regimbart
perfectly
is
he
still
living
he
is
barely
alive
every
evening
regularly
he
drags
himself
from
the
rue
de
grammont
to
the
rue
montmartre
to
the
cafés
enfeebled
bent
in
two
emaciated
a
spectre
well
and
what
about
compain
frederick
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
begged
of
the
of
the
provisional
government
to
explain
to
him
the
mystery
of
the
calf
head
is
an
english
importation
in
order
to
parody
the
ceremony
which
the
royalists
celebrated
on
the
thirtieth
of
january
some
independents
founded
an
annual
banquet
at
which
they
have
been
accustomed
to
eat
calves
heads
and
at
which
they
make
it
their
business
to
drink
red
wine
out
of
calves
skulls
while
giving
toasts
in
favour
of
the
extermination
of
the
stuarts
after
thermidor
the
terrorists
organised
a
brotherhood
of
a
similar
description
which
proves
how
prolific
folly
is
you
seem
to
me
very
dispassionate
about
politics
effect
of
age
said
the
advocate
and
then
they
each
proceeded
to
summarise
their
lives
they
had
both
failed
in
their
objects
the
one
who
dreamed
only
of
love
and
the
other
of
power
what
was
the
reason
of
this
is
perhaps
from
not
having
taken
up
the
proper
line
said
frederick
in
your
case
that
may
be
so
i
on
the
contrary
have
sinned
through
excess
of
rectitude
without
taking
into
account
a
thousand
secondary
things
more
important
than
any
i
had
too
much
logic
and
you
too
much
sentiment
then
they
blamed
luck
circumstances
the
epoch
at
which
they
were
born
frederick
went
on
we
have
never
done
what
we
thought
of
doing
long
ago
at
sens
when
you
wished
to
write
a
critical
history
of
philosophy
and
i
a
great
mediæval
romance
about
nogent
the
subject
of
which
i
had
found
in
froissart
messire
brokars
de
fenestranges
and
the
archbishop
of
troyes
attacked
messire
eustache
do
you
remember
and
exhuming
their
youth
with
every
sentence
they
said
to
each
other
do
you
remember
they
saw
once
more
the
college
playground
the
chapel
the
parlour
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
the
faces
of
the
ushers
and
of
the
pupils
one
named
angelmare
from
versailles
who
used
to
cut
off
from
old
boots
mirbal
and
his
red
whiskers
the
two
professors
of
linear
drawing
and
large
drawing
who
were
always
wrangling
and
the
pole
the
of
copernicus
with
his
planetary
system
on
pasteboard
an
itinerant
astronomer
whose
lecture
had
been
paid
for
by
a
dinner
in
the
refectory
then
a
terrible
debauch
while
they
were
out
on
a
walking
excursion
the
first
pipes
they
had
smoked
the
distribution
of
prizes
and
the
delightful
sensation
of
going
home
for
the
holidays
it
was
during
the
vacation
of
that
they
had
called
at
the
house
of
the
turkish
woman
this
was
the
phrase
used
to
designate
a
woman
whose
real
name
was
zoraide
turc
and
many
persons
believed
her
to
be
a
mohammedan
a
turk
which
added
to
the
poetic
character
of
her
establishment
situated
at
the
water
edge
behind
the
rampart
even
in
the
middle
of
summer
there
was
a
shadow
around
her
house
which
could
be
recognised
by
a
glass
bowl
of
goldfish
near
a
pot
of
mignonette
at
a
window
young
ladies
in
white
nightdresses
with
painted
cheeks
and
long
earrings
used
to
tap
at
the
panes
as
the
students
passed
and
as
it
grew
dark
their
custom
was
to
hum
softly
in
their
hoarse
voices
at
the
doorsteps
this
home
of
perdition
spread
its
fantastic
notoriety
over
all
the
arrondissement
allusions
were
made
to
it
in
a
circumlocutory
style
the
place
you
know
a
certain
street
at
the
bottom
of
the
bridges
it
made
the
farmers
wives
of
the
district
tremble
for
their
husbands
and
the
ladies
grow
apprehensive
as
to
their
servants
virtue
inasmuch
as
the
cook
had
been
caught
there
and
to
be
sure
it
exercised
a
fascination
over
the
minds
of
all
the
young
lads
of
the
place
now
one
sunday
during
frederick
and
deslauriers
having
previously
curled
their
hair
gathered
some
flowers
in
madame
garden
then
made
their
way
out
through
the
gate
leading
into
the
fields
and
after
taking
a
wide
sweep
round
the
vineyards
came
back
through
the
fishery
and
stole
into
the
turkish
woman
house
with
their
big
bouquets
still
in
their
hands
frederick
presented
his
as
a
lover
does
to
his
betrothed
but
the
great
heat
the
fear
of
the
unknown
and
even
the
very
pleasure
of
seeing
at
one
glance
so
many
women
placed
at
his
disposal
excited
him
so
strangely
that
he
turned
exceedingly
pale
and
remained
there
without
advancing
a
single
step
or
uttering
a
single
word
all
the
girls
burst
out
laughing
amused
at
his
embarrassment
fancying
that
they
were
turning
him
into
ridicule
he
ran
away
and
as
frederick
had
the
money
deslauriers
was
obliged
to
follow
him
they
were
seen
leaving
the
house
and
the
episode
furnished
material
for
a
bit
of
local
gossip
which
was
not
forgotten
three
years
later
they
related
the
story
to
each
other
in
a
prolix
fashion
each
supplementing
the
narrative
where
the
other
memory
failed
and
when
they
had
finished
the
recital
that
was
the
best
time
we
ever
had
said
frederick
yes
perhaps
so
indeed
it
was
the
best
time
we
ever
had
said
deslauriers
