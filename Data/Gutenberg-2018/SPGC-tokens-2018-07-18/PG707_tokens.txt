i
i
am
still
uncertain
which
surprised
me
more
the
telegram
calling
my
attention
to
the
advertisement
or
the
advertisement
itself
the
telegram
is
before
me
as
i
write
it
would
appear
to
have
been
handed
in
at
vere
street
at
eight
in
the
morning
of
may
and
received
before
at
holloway
and
in
that
drab
region
it
duly
found
me
unwashen
but
at
work
before
the
day
grew
hot
and
my
attic
insupportable
see
maturin
advertisement
daily
mail
might
suit
you
earnestly
beg
try
will
speak
if
necessary
i
transcribe
the
thing
as
i
see
it
before
me
all
in
one
breath
that
took
away
mine
but
i
leave
out
the
initials
at
the
end
which
completed
the
surprise
they
stood
very
obviously
for
the
knighted
specialist
whose
is
within
a
of
vere
street
and
who
once
called
me
kinsman
for
his
sins
more
recently
he
had
called
me
other
names
i
was
a
disgrace
qualified
by
an
adjective
which
seemed
to
me
another
i
had
made
my
bed
and
i
could
go
and
lie
and
die
in
it
if
i
ever
again
had
the
insolence
to
show
my
nose
in
that
house
i
should
go
out
quicker
than
i
came
in
all
this
and
more
my
least
distant
relative
could
tell
a
poor
devil
to
his
face
could
ring
for
his
man
and
give
him
his
brutal
instructions
on
the
spot
and
then
relent
to
the
tune
of
this
telegram
i
have
no
phrase
for
my
amazement
i
literally
could
not
believe
my
eyes
yet
their
evidence
was
more
and
more
conclusive
a
very
epistle
could
not
have
been
more
characteristic
of
its
sender
meanly
elliptical
ludicrously
precise
saving
at
the
expense
of
sense
yet
paying
like
a
man
for
maturin
that
was
my
distinguished
relative
from
his
bald
patch
to
his
corns
nor
was
all
the
rest
unlike
him
upon
second
thoughts
he
had
a
reputation
for
charity
he
was
going
to
live
up
to
it
after
all
either
that
or
it
was
the
sudden
impulse
of
which
the
most
calculating
are
capable
at
times
the
morning
papers
with
the
early
cup
of
tea
this
advertisement
seen
by
chance
and
the
rest
upon
the
spur
of
a
guilty
conscience
well
i
must
see
it
for
myself
and
the
sooner
the
better
though
work
pressed
i
was
writing
a
series
of
articles
upon
prison
life
and
had
my
nib
into
the
whole
system
a
literary
and
philanthropical
daily
was
parading
my
charges
the
graver
ones
with
the
more
gusto
and
the
terms
if
unhandsome
for
creative
work
were
temporary
wealth
to
me
it
so
happened
that
my
first
check
had
just
arrived
by
the
eight
post
and
my
position
should
be
appreciated
when
i
say
that
i
had
to
cash
it
to
obtain
a
daily
mail
of
the
advertisement
itself
what
is
to
be
said
it
should
speak
for
itself
if
i
could
find
it
but
i
can
not
and
only
remember
that
it
was
a
male
nurse
and
constant
attendant
that
was
wanted
for
an
elderly
gentleman
in
feeble
health
a
male
nurse
an
absurd
tag
was
appended
offering
liberal
salary
to
university
or
man
and
of
a
sudden
i
saw
that
i
should
get
this
thing
if
i
applied
for
it
what
other
university
or
man
would
dream
of
doing
so
was
any
other
in
such
straits
as
i
and
then
my
relenting
relative
he
not
only
promised
to
speak
for
me
but
was
the
very
man
to
do
so
could
any
recommendation
compete
with
his
in
the
matter
of
a
male
nurse
and
need
the
duties
of
such
be
necessarily
loathsome
and
repellent
certainly
the
surroundings
would
be
better
than
those
of
my
common
and
own
particular
garret
and
the
food
and
every
other
condition
of
life
that
i
could
think
of
on
my
way
back
to
that
unsavory
asylum
so
i
dived
into
a
pawnbroker
shop
where
i
was
a
stranger
only
upon
my
present
errand
and
within
the
hour
was
airing
a
decent
if
antiquated
suit
but
little
corrupted
by
the
moth
and
a
new
straw
hat
on
the
top
of
a
tram
the
address
given
in
the
advertisement
was
that
of
a
flat
at
court
which
cost
me
a
journey
finishing
with
the
district
railway
and
a
seven
minutes
walk
it
was
now
past
and
the
tarry
was
good
to
smell
as
i
strode
up
the
court
road
it
was
great
to
walk
the
civilized
world
again
here
were
men
with
coats
on
their
backs
and
ladies
in
gloves
my
only
fear
was
lest
i
might
run
up
against
one
or
other
whom
i
had
known
of
old
but
it
was
my
lucky
day
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
i
was
going
to
get
this
berth
and
sometimes
i
should
be
able
to
smell
the
on
the
old
boy
errands
perhaps
he
would
insist
on
skimming
over
it
in
his
with
me
behind
i
felt
quite
nervous
when
i
reached
the
flats
they
were
a
small
pile
in
a
side
street
and
i
pitied
the
doctor
whose
plate
i
saw
upon
the
palings
before
the
windows
he
must
be
in
a
very
small
way
i
thought
i
rather
pitied
myself
as
well
i
had
indulged
in
visions
of
better
flats
than
these
there
were
no
balconies
the
porter
was
out
of
livery
there
was
no
lift
and
my
invalid
on
the
third
floor
i
trudged
up
wishing
i
had
never
lived
in
mount
street
and
brushed
against
a
dejected
individual
coming
down
a
young
fellow
in
a
flung
the
right
door
open
at
my
summons
does
maturin
live
here
i
inquired
that
right
said
the
young
man
grinning
all
over
a
convivial
countenance
i
i
come
about
his
advertisement
in
the
daily
mail
you
the
cried
the
blood
that
was
the
you
met
upon
the
stairs
and
the
day
still
young
excuse
my
staring
at
you
yes
you
pass
your
and
can
come
inside
you
one
of
the
few
we
had
most
just
after
breakfast
but
now
the
heading
off
the
worst
cases
and
that
last
chap
was
the
first
for
twenty
minutes
come
in
here
and
i
was
ushered
into
an
empty
room
with
a
good
which
enabled
my
friend
to
inspect
me
yet
more
critically
in
a
good
light
this
he
did
without
the
least
false
delicacy
then
his
questions
began
man
no
public
school
yes
which
one
i
told
him
and
he
sighed
relief
at
last
you
the
very
first
i
not
had
to
argue
with
as
to
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
public
school
expelled
no
i
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
no
i
was
not
expelled
and
i
hope
you
wo
expel
me
if
i
ask
a
question
in
my
turn
certainly
not
are
you
maturin
son
no
my
name
theobald
you
may
have
seen
it
down
below
the
doctor
i
said
his
doctor
said
theobald
with
a
satisfied
eye
doctor
he
is
having
a
male
nurse
and
attendant
by
my
advice
and
he
wants
a
gentleman
if
he
can
get
one
i
rather
think
he
see
you
though
he
only
seen
two
or
three
all
day
there
are
certain
questions
which
he
prefers
to
ask
himself
and
it
no
good
going
over
the
same
ground
twice
so
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
him
about
you
before
we
get
any
further
and
he
withdrew
to
a
room
still
nearer
the
entrance
as
i
could
hear
for
it
was
a
very
small
flat
indeed
but
now
two
doors
were
shut
between
us
and
i
had
to
rest
content
with
murmurs
through
the
wall
until
the
doctor
returned
to
summon
me
i
have
persuaded
my
patient
to
see
you
he
whispered
but
i
confess
i
am
not
sanguine
of
the
result
he
is
very
difficult
to
please
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
a
querulous
invalid
and
for
no
sinecure
if
you
get
the
billet
may
i
ask
what
the
matter
with
him
by
all
means
when
you
got
the
billet
theobald
then
led
the
way
his
professional
dignity
so
thoroughly
intact
that
i
could
not
but
smile
as
i
followed
his
swinging
to
the
i
carried
no
smile
across
the
threshold
of
a
darkened
chamber
which
reeked
of
drugs
and
twinkled
with
medicine
bottles
and
in
the
middle
of
which
a
gaunt
figure
lay
abed
in
the
take
him
to
the
window
take
him
to
the
window
a
thin
voice
snapped
and
let
have
a
look
at
him
open
the
blind
a
bit
not
as
much
as
that
damn
you
not
as
much
as
that
the
doctor
took
the
oath
as
though
it
had
been
a
fee
i
no
longer
pitied
him
it
was
now
very
clear
to
me
that
he
had
one
patient
who
was
a
little
practice
in
himself
i
determined
there
and
then
that
he
should
prove
a
little
profession
to
me
if
we
could
but
keep
him
alive
between
us
maturin
however
had
the
whitest
face
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
his
teeth
gleamed
out
through
the
dusk
as
though
the
withered
lips
no
longer
met
about
them
nor
did
they
except
in
speech
and
anything
ghastlier
than
the
perpetual
grin
of
his
repose
i
defy
you
to
imagine
it
was
with
this
grin
that
he
lay
regarding
me
while
the
doctor
held
the
blind
so
you
think
you
could
look
after
me
do
you
i
certain
i
could
sir
mind
i
do
keep
another
soul
you
would
have
to
cook
your
own
grub
and
my
slops
do
you
think
you
could
do
all
that
yes
sir
i
think
so
why
do
you
have
you
any
experience
of
the
kind
no
sir
none
then
why
do
you
pretend
you
have
i
only
meant
that
i
would
do
my
best
only
meant
only
meant
have
you
done
your
best
at
everything
else
then
i
hung
my
head
this
was
a
facer
and
there
was
something
in
my
invalid
which
thrust
the
unspoken
lie
down
my
throat
no
sir
i
have
not
i
told
him
plainly
he
he
he
the
old
wretch
tittered
and
you
do
well
to
own
it
you
do
well
sir
very
well
indeed
if
you
had
owned
up
out
you
would
have
gone
out
you
saved
your
bacon
you
may
do
more
so
you
are
a
boy
and
a
very
good
school
yours
is
but
you
were
at
either
university
is
that
correct
absolutely
what
did
you
do
when
you
left
school
i
came
in
for
money
and
then
i
spent
my
money
and
since
then
i
stood
like
a
mule
and
since
then
i
say
a
relative
of
mine
will
tell
you
if
you
ask
him
he
is
an
eminent
man
and
he
has
promised
to
speak
for
me
i
would
rather
say
no
more
myself
but
you
shall
sir
but
you
shall
do
you
suppose
that
i
suppose
a
boy
would
apply
for
a
berth
like
this
if
something
or
other
had
happened
what
i
want
is
a
gentleman
of
sorts
and
i
do
much
care
what
sort
but
you
got
to
tell
me
what
did
happen
if
you
do
tell
anybody
else
theobald
sir
you
can
go
to
the
devil
if
you
wo
take
a
hint
this
man
may
do
or
he
may
not
you
have
no
more
to
say
to
it
till
i
send
him
down
to
tell
you
one
thing
or
the
other
clear
out
sir
clear
out
and
if
you
think
you
anything
to
complain
of
you
stick
it
down
in
the
bill
in
the
mild
excitement
of
our
interview
the
thin
voice
had
gathered
strength
and
the
last
shrill
insult
was
screamed
after
the
devoted
medico
as
he
retired
in
such
order
that
i
felt
certain
he
was
going
to
take
this
trying
patient
at
his
word
the
bedroom
door
closed
then
the
outer
one
and
the
doctor
heels
went
drumming
down
the
common
stair
i
was
alone
in
the
flat
with
this
highly
singular
and
rather
terrible
old
man
and
a
damned
good
riddance
croaked
the
invalid
raising
himself
on
one
elbow
without
delay
i
may
not
have
much
body
left
to
boast
about
but
at
least
i
got
a
lost
old
soul
to
call
my
own
why
i
want
a
gentleman
of
sorts
about
me
i
been
too
dependent
on
that
chap
he
wo
even
let
me
smoke
and
he
been
in
the
flat
all
day
to
see
i
did
you
find
the
cigarettes
behind
the
madonna
of
the
chair
it
was
a
steel
engraving
of
the
great
raffaelle
and
the
frame
was
tilted
from
the
wall
at
a
touch
a
packet
of
cigarettes
tumbled
down
from
behind
thanks
and
now
a
light
i
struck
the
match
and
held
it
while
the
invalid
inhaled
with
normal
lips
and
suddenly
i
sighed
i
was
irresistibly
reminded
of
my
poor
dear
old
raffles
a
worthy
of
the
great
was
floating
upward
from
the
sick
man
lips
and
now
take
one
yourself
i
have
smoked
more
poisonous
cigarettes
but
even
these
are
not
sullivans
i
can
not
repeat
what
i
said
i
have
no
idea
what
i
did
i
only
know
i
only
knew
that
it
was
raffles
in
the
flesh
ii
yes
bunny
it
was
the
very
devil
of
a
swim
but
i
defy
you
to
sink
in
the
mediterranean
that
sunset
saved
me
the
sea
was
on
fire
i
hardly
swam
under
water
at
all
but
went
all
i
knew
for
the
sun
itself
when
it
set
i
must
have
been
a
mile
away
until
it
did
i
was
the
invisible
man
i
figured
on
that
and
only
hope
it
was
set
down
as
a
case
of
suicide
i
shall
get
outed
quite
soon
enough
bunny
but
i
rather
be
dropped
by
the
hangman
than
throw
my
own
wicket
away
oh
my
dear
old
chap
to
think
of
having
you
by
the
hand
again
i
feel
as
though
we
were
both
aboard
that
german
liner
and
all
happened
since
a
nightmare
i
thought
that
time
was
the
last
it
looked
rather
like
it
bunny
it
was
taking
all
the
risks
and
hitting
at
everything
but
the
game
came
off
and
some
day
i
tell
you
how
oh
i
in
no
hurry
to
hear
it
enough
for
me
to
see
you
lying
there
i
do
want
to
know
how
you
came
there
or
why
though
i
fear
you
must
be
pretty
bad
i
must
have
a
good
look
at
you
before
i
let
you
speak
another
word
i
raised
one
of
the
blinds
i
sat
upon
the
bed
and
i
had
that
look
it
left
me
all
unable
to
conjecture
his
true
state
of
health
but
quite
certain
in
my
own
mind
that
my
dear
raffles
was
not
and
never
would
be
the
man
that
he
had
been
he
had
aged
twenty
years
he
looked
fifty
at
the
very
least
his
hair
was
white
there
was
no
trick
about
that
and
his
face
was
another
white
the
lines
about
the
corners
of
the
eyes
and
mouth
were
both
many
and
deep
on
the
other
hand
the
eyes
themselves
were
alight
and
alert
as
ever
they
were
still
keen
and
gray
and
gleaming
like
finely
tempered
steel
even
the
mouth
with
a
cigarette
to
close
it
was
the
mouth
of
raffles
and
no
other
strong
and
unscrupulous
as
the
man
himself
it
was
only
the
physical
strength
which
appeared
to
have
departed
but
that
was
quite
sufficient
to
make
my
heart
bleed
for
the
dear
rascal
who
had
cost
me
every
tie
i
valued
but
the
tie
between
us
two
think
i
look
much
older
he
asked
at
length
a
bit
i
admitted
but
it
is
chiefly
your
hair
whereby
hangs
a
tale
for
when
we
talked
ourselves
out
though
i
have
often
thought
it
was
that
long
swim
that
started
it
still
the
island
of
elba
is
a
rummy
show
i
can
assure
you
and
naples
is
a
rummier
you
went
there
after
all
rather
it
the
european
paradise
for
such
as
our
noble
selves
but
there
no
place
that
a
patch
on
little
london
as
a
of
heat
it
never
need
get
too
hot
for
a
fellow
here
if
it
does
his
own
fault
it
the
kind
of
wicket
you
do
get
out
on
unless
you
get
yourself
out
so
here
i
am
again
and
have
been
for
the
last
six
weeks
and
i
mean
to
have
another
knock
but
surely
old
fellow
you
not
awfully
fit
are
you
fit
my
dear
bunny
i
dead
i
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
you
forget
it
for
a
minute
but
are
you
all
right
or
are
you
not
no
i
by
theobald
prescriptions
and
putrid
cigarettes
and
as
weak
as
a
cat
from
lying
in
bed
then
why
on
earth
lie
in
bed
raffles
because
it
better
than
lying
in
gaol
as
i
am
afraid
you
know
my
poor
dear
fellow
i
tell
you
i
am
dead
and
my
one
terror
is
of
coming
to
life
again
by
accident
ca
you
see
i
simply
dare
not
show
my
nose
out
of
doors
by
day
you
have
no
idea
of
the
number
of
perfectly
innocent
things
a
dead
man
dare
do
i
ca
even
smoke
sullivans
because
no
one
man
was
ever
so
partial
to
them
as
i
was
in
my
lifetime
and
you
never
know
when
you
may
start
a
clew
what
brought
you
to
these
mansions
i
fancied
a
flat
and
a
man
recommended
these
on
the
boat
such
a
good
chap
bunny
he
was
my
reference
when
it
came
to
signing
the
lease
you
see
i
landed
on
a
stretcher
most
pathetic
case
old
australian
without
a
friend
in
old
country
ordered
engadine
as
last
chance
no
go
not
an
earthly
sentimental
wish
to
die
in
london
that
the
history
of
maturin
if
it
does
hit
you
hard
bunny
you
the
first
but
it
hit
friend
theobald
hardest
of
all
i
an
income
to
him
i
believe
he
going
to
marry
on
me
does
he
guess
there
nothing
wrong
knows
bless
you
but
he
does
know
i
know
he
knows
and
there
is
a
disease
in
the
dictionary
that
he
has
treated
me
for
since
he
had
me
in
hand
to
do
him
justice
i
believe
he
thinks
me
a
hypochondriac
of
the
first
water
but
that
young
man
will
go
far
if
he
keeps
on
the
wicket
he
has
spent
half
his
nights
up
here
at
guineas
apiece
guineas
must
be
plentiful
old
chap
they
have
been
bunny
i
ca
say
more
but
i
do
see
why
they
should
be
again
i
was
not
going
to
inquire
where
the
guineas
came
from
as
if
i
cared
but
i
did
ask
old
raffles
how
in
the
world
he
had
got
upon
my
tracks
and
thereby
drew
the
sort
of
smile
with
which
old
gentlemen
rub
their
hands
and
old
ladies
nod
their
noses
raffles
merely
produced
a
perfect
oval
of
blue
smoke
before
replying
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
ask
that
bunny
it
a
long
time
since
i
did
anything
upon
which
i
plume
myself
more
of
course
in
the
first
place
i
spotted
you
at
once
by
these
prison
articles
they
were
not
signed
but
the
fist
was
the
fist
of
my
sitting
rabbit
but
who
gave
you
my
address
i
wheedled
it
out
of
your
excellent
editor
called
on
him
at
dead
of
night
when
i
occasionally
go
afield
like
other
ghosts
and
wept
it
out
of
him
in
five
minutes
i
was
your
only
relative
your
name
was
not
your
own
name
if
he
insisted
i
would
give
him
mine
he
insist
bunny
and
i
danced
down
his
stairs
with
your
address
in
my
pocket
last
night
no
last
week
and
so
the
advertisement
was
yours
as
well
as
the
telegram
i
had
of
course
forgotten
both
in
the
high
excitement
of
the
hour
or
i
should
scarcely
have
announced
my
belated
discovery
with
such
an
air
as
it
was
i
made
raffles
look
at
me
as
i
had
known
him
look
before
and
the
droop
of
his
eyelids
began
to
sting
why
all
this
subtlety
i
petulantly
exclaimed
why
could
you
come
straight
away
to
me
in
a
cab
he
did
not
inform
me
that
i
was
hopeless
as
ever
he
did
not
address
me
as
his
good
rabbit
he
was
silent
for
a
time
and
then
spoke
in
a
tone
which
made
me
ashamed
of
mine
you
see
there
are
two
or
three
of
me
now
bunny
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
mediterranean
and
one
an
old
australian
desirous
of
dying
in
the
old
country
but
in
no
immediate
danger
of
dying
anywhere
the
old
australian
does
know
a
soul
in
town
he
got
to
be
consistent
or
he
done
this
sitter
theobald
is
his
only
friend
and
has
seen
rather
too
much
of
him
ordinary
dust
wo
do
for
his
eyes
begin
to
see
to
pick
you
out
of
a
crowd
that
was
the
game
to
let
old
theobald
help
to
pick
you
better
still
to
start
with
he
was
dead
against
my
having
anybody
at
all
wanted
me
all
to
himself
naturally
but
anything
rather
than
kill
the
goose
so
he
is
to
have
a
fiver
a
week
while
he
keeps
me
alive
and
he
going
to
be
married
next
month
that
a
pity
in
some
ways
but
a
good
thing
in
others
he
will
want
more
money
than
he
foresees
and
he
may
always
be
of
use
to
us
at
a
pinch
meanwhile
he
eats
out
of
my
hand
i
complimented
raffles
on
the
mere
composition
of
his
telegram
with
half
the
characteristics
of
my
distinguished
kinsman
squeezed
into
a
dozen
odd
words
and
let
him
know
how
the
old
ruffian
had
really
treated
me
raffles
was
not
surprised
we
had
dined
together
at
my
relative
in
the
old
days
and
filed
for
reference
a
professional
valuation
of
his
household
gods
i
now
learnt
that
the
telegram
had
been
posted
with
the
hour
marked
for
its
despatch
at
the
pillar
nearest
vere
street
on
the
night
before
the
advertisement
was
due
to
appear
in
the
daily
mail
this
also
had
been
carefully
prearranged
and
raffles
only
fear
had
been
lest
it
might
be
held
over
despite
his
explicit
instructions
and
so
drive
me
to
the
doctor
for
an
explanation
of
his
telegram
but
the
adverse
chances
had
been
weeded
out
and
weeded
out
to
the
irreducible
minimum
of
risk
his
greatest
risk
according
to
raffles
lay
nearest
home
bedridden
invalid
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
his
nightly
terror
was
of
running
into
theobald
arms
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
flat
but
raffles
had
characteristic
methods
of
minimizing
even
that
danger
of
which
something
anon
meanwhile
he
recounted
more
than
one
of
his
nocturnal
adventures
all
however
of
a
singularly
innocent
type
and
one
thing
i
noticed
while
he
talked
his
room
was
the
first
as
you
entered
the
flat
the
long
inner
wall
divided
the
room
not
merely
from
the
passage
but
from
the
outer
landing
as
well
thus
every
step
upon
the
bare
stone
stairs
could
be
heard
by
raffles
where
he
lay
and
he
would
never
speak
while
one
was
ascending
until
it
had
passed
his
door
the
afternoon
brought
more
than
one
applicant
for
the
post
which
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
them
that
i
had
already
obtained
between
three
and
four
however
raffles
suddenly
looking
at
his
watch
packed
me
off
in
a
hurry
to
the
other
end
of
london
for
my
things
i
afraid
you
must
be
famishing
bunny
it
a
fact
that
i
eat
very
little
and
that
at
odd
hours
but
i
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
you
get
yourself
a
snack
outside
but
not
a
square
meal
if
you
can
resist
one
we
got
to
celebrate
this
day
this
night
i
cried
at
eleven
and
kellner
the
place
you
may
well
open
your
eyes
but
we
did
go
there
much
if
you
remember
and
the
staff
seems
changed
anyway
we
risk
it
for
once
i
was
in
last
night
talking
like
a
stage
american
and
supper
ordered
for
eleven
sharp
you
made
as
sure
of
me
as
all
that
there
was
no
harm
in
ordering
supper
we
shall
have
it
in
a
private
room
but
you
may
as
well
dress
if
you
got
the
duds
they
at
my
only
forgiving
relative
how
much
will
get
them
out
and
square
you
up
and
bring
you
back
bag
and
baggage
in
good
time
i
had
to
calculate
a
tenner
easily
i
had
one
ready
for
you
here
it
is
and
i
would
lose
any
time
if
i
were
you
on
the
way
you
might
look
up
theobald
tell
him
you
got
it
and
how
long
you
be
gone
and
that
i
ca
be
left
alone
all
the
time
and
by
jove
yes
you
get
me
a
stall
for
the
lyceum
at
the
nearest
agent
there
are
two
or
three
in
high
street
and
say
it
was
given
you
when
you
come
in
that
young
man
shall
be
out
of
the
way
i
found
our
doctor
in
a
minute
and
his
a
tall
tumbler
at
his
elbow
at
least
i
caught
sight
of
the
tumbler
on
entering
thereafter
he
stood
in
front
of
it
with
a
futility
which
had
my
sympathy
so
you
got
the
billet
said
theobald
well
as
i
told
you
before
and
as
you
have
since
probably
discovered
for
yourself
you
wo
find
it
exactly
a
sinecure
my
own
part
of
the
business
is
by
no
means
that
indeed
there
are
those
who
would
throw
up
the
case
after
the
kind
of
treatment
that
you
have
seen
for
yourself
but
professional
considerations
are
not
the
only
ones
and
one
can
not
make
too
many
allowances
in
such
a
case
but
what
is
the
case
i
asked
him
you
said
you
would
tell
me
if
i
was
successful
theobald
shrug
was
worthy
of
the
profession
he
seemed
destined
to
adorn
it
was
not
incompatible
with
any
construction
which
one
chose
to
put
upon
it
next
moment
he
had
stiffened
i
suppose
i
still
spoke
more
or
less
like
a
gentleman
yet
after
all
i
was
only
the
male
nurse
he
seemed
to
remember
this
suddenly
and
he
took
occasion
to
remind
me
of
the
fact
ah
said
he
that
was
before
i
knew
you
were
altogether
without
experience
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
surprised
even
at
engaging
you
after
that
but
it
will
depend
upon
yourself
how
long
i
allow
him
to
persist
in
so
curious
an
experiment
as
for
what
is
the
matter
with
him
my
good
fellow
it
is
no
use
my
giving
you
an
answer
which
would
be
double
dutch
to
you
moreover
i
have
still
to
test
your
discretionary
powers
i
may
say
however
that
that
poor
gentleman
presents
at
once
the
most
complex
and
most
troublesome
case
which
is
responsibility
enough
without
certain
features
which
make
it
all
but
insupportable
beyond
this
i
must
refuse
to
discuss
my
patient
for
the
present
but
i
shall
certainly
go
up
if
i
can
find
time
he
went
up
within
five
minutes
i
found
him
there
on
my
return
at
dusk
but
he
did
not
refuse
my
stall
for
the
lyceum
which
raffles
would
not
allow
me
to
use
myself
and
presented
to
him
without
my
leave
and
do
you
bother
any
more
about
me
till
snapped
the
high
thin
voice
as
he
was
off
i
can
send
for
you
now
when
i
want
you
and
i
hoping
to
have
a
decent
night
for
once
iii
it
was
ten
when
we
left
the
flat
in
an
interval
of
silence
on
the
noisy
stairs
the
silence
was
unbroken
by
our
wary
feet
yet
for
me
a
surprise
was
in
store
upon
the
very
landing
instead
of
going
downstairs
raffles
led
me
up
two
flights
and
so
out
upon
a
perfectly
flat
roof
there
are
two
entrances
to
these
mansions
he
explained
between
stars
and
one
to
our
staircase
and
another
round
the
corner
but
there
only
one
porter
and
he
lives
on
the
basement
underneath
us
and
affects
the
door
nearest
home
we
miss
him
by
using
the
wrong
stairs
and
we
run
less
risk
of
old
theobald
i
got
the
tip
from
the
postmen
who
come
up
one
way
and
down
the
other
now
follow
me
and
look
out
there
was
indeed
some
necessity
for
caution
for
each
half
of
the
building
had
its
well
dropping
sheer
to
the
base
the
parapets
so
low
that
one
might
easily
have
tripped
over
them
into
eternity
however
we
were
soon
upon
the
second
staircase
which
opened
on
the
roof
like
the
first
and
twenty
minutes
of
the
next
we
spent
in
an
admirable
hansom
skimming
east
not
much
change
in
the
old
hole
bunny
more
of
these
advertisements
and
absolutely
the
worst
bit
of
taste
in
town
though
it
saying
something
in
that
equestrian
statue
with
the
gilt
stirrups
and
fixings
why
do
they
black
the
buffer
boots
and
his
horse
hoofs
while
they
are
about
it
more
bicyclists
of
course
that
was
just
beginning
if
you
remember
it
might
have
been
useful
to
us
and
there
the
old
club
getting
put
into
a
crate
for
the
jubilee
by
jove
bunny
we
ought
to
be
there
i
would
lean
forward
in
piccadilly
old
chap
if
you
seen
i
thought
of
and
we
shall
have
to
be
jolly
careful
at
kellner
ah
there
it
is
did
i
tell
you
i
was
a
stage
yankee
at
kellner
you
better
be
another
while
the
waiter
in
the
room
we
had
the
little
room
upstairs
and
on
the
very
threshold
i
even
i
who
knew
my
raffles
of
old
was
taken
horribly
aback
the
table
was
laid
for
three
i
called
his
attention
to
it
in
a
whisper
why
yep
came
through
his
nose
say
boy
the
lady
she
not
comin
but
you
leave
that
tackle
where
is
if
i
liable
to
pay
i
guess
i
have
all
there
is
to
it
i
have
never
been
in
america
and
the
american
public
is
the
last
on
earth
that
i
desire
to
insult
but
idiom
and
intonation
alike
would
have
imposed
upon
my
inexperience
i
had
to
look
at
raffles
to
make
sure
that
it
was
he
who
spoke
and
i
had
my
own
reasons
for
looking
hard
who
on
earth
was
the
lady
i
inquired
aghast
at
the
first
opportunity
she
is
on
earth
they
do
like
wasting
this
room
on
two
all
bunny
my
bunny
here
to
us
both
and
we
clinked
glasses
swimming
with
the
liquid
gold
of
steinberg
but
of
the
rare
delights
of
that
supper
i
can
scarcely
trust
myself
to
write
it
was
no
mere
meal
it
was
no
coarse
orgy
but
a
little
feast
for
the
fastidious
gods
not
unworthy
of
lucullus
at
his
worst
and
i
who
had
bolted
my
skilly
at
wormwood
scrubbs
and
tightened
my
belt
in
a
holloway
attic
it
was
i
who
sat
down
to
this
ineffable
repast
where
the
courses
were
few
but
each
a
triumph
of
its
kind
it
would
be
invidious
to
single
out
any
one
dish
but
the
jambon
de
westphalie
au
champagne
tempts
me
sorely
and
then
the
champagne
that
we
drank
not
the
quantity
but
the
quality
well
it
was
pol
roger
and
quite
good
enough
for
me
but
even
so
it
was
not
more
dry
nor
did
it
sparkle
more
than
the
merry
rascal
who
had
dragged
me
thus
far
to
the
devil
but
should
lead
me
dancing
the
rest
of
the
way
i
was
beginning
to
tell
him
so
i
had
done
my
honest
best
since
my
reappearance
in
the
world
but
the
world
had
done
its
worst
by
me
a
further
antithesis
and
my
final
intention
were
both
upon
my
tongue
when
the
waiter
with
the
chateau
margaux
cut
me
short
for
he
was
the
bearer
of
more
than
that
great
wine
bringing
also
a
card
upon
a
silver
tray
show
him
up
said
raffles
laconically
and
who
is
this
i
cried
when
the
man
was
gone
raffles
reached
across
the
table
and
gripped
my
arm
in
a
vice
his
eyes
were
steel
points
fixed
on
mine
bunny
stand
by
me
said
he
in
the
old
irresistible
voice
a
voice
both
stern
and
winning
stand
by
me
bunny
if
there
a
row
and
there
was
time
for
nothing
more
the
door
flying
open
and
a
dapper
person
entering
with
a
bow
a
on
his
back
gold
on
his
nose
a
shiny
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
black
bag
in
the
other
gentlemen
said
he
at
home
and
smiling
sit
down
drawled
raffles
in
casual
response
say
let
me
introduce
you
to
ezra
martin
of
shicawgo
martin
is
my
future
this
is
robinson
ezra
manager
to
sparks
company
the
cellerbrated
joolers
on
street
i
pricked
up
my
ears
but
contented
myself
with
a
nod
i
altogether
distrusted
my
ability
to
live
up
to
my
new
name
and
address
i
figured
on
miss
martin
bein
right
here
too
continued
raffles
but
i
regret
to
say
she
not
feelin
so
good
we
light
out
for
parrus
on
the
train
mornin
and
she
guessed
be
too
dead
sorry
to
disappoint
you
robinson
but
you
see
advertisin
your
wares
raffles
held
his
right
hand
under
the
electric
light
and
a
diamond
ring
flashed
upon
his
little
finger
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
not
there
five
minutes
before
the
tradesman
had
a
disappointed
face
but
for
a
moment
it
brightened
as
he
expatiated
on
the
value
of
that
ring
and
on
the
price
his
people
had
accepted
for
it
i
was
invited
to
guess
the
figure
but
i
shook
a
discreet
head
i
have
seldom
been
more
taciturn
in
my
life
pounds
cried
the
jeweller
and
it
would
be
cheap
at
fifty
guineas
that
right
assented
raffles
that
be
dead
cheap
i
allow
but
then
my
boy
you
gotten
ready
cash
and
do
you
forget
it
i
do
not
dwell
upon
my
own
mystification
in
all
this
i
merely
pause
to
state
that
i
was
keenly
enjoying
that
very
element
nothing
could
have
been
more
typical
of
raffles
and
the
past
it
was
only
my
own
attitude
that
was
changed
it
appeared
that
the
mythical
lady
my
sister
had
just
become
engaged
to
raffles
who
seemed
all
anxiety
to
pin
her
down
with
gifts
of
price
i
could
not
quite
gather
whose
gift
to
whom
was
the
diamond
ring
but
it
had
evidently
been
paid
for
and
i
voyaged
to
the
moon
wondering
when
and
how
i
was
recalled
to
this
planet
by
a
deluge
of
gems
from
the
jeweller
bag
they
lay
alight
in
their
cases
like
the
electric
lamps
above
we
all
three
put
our
heads
together
over
them
myself
without
the
slightest
clew
as
to
what
was
coming
but
not
unprepared
for
violent
crime
one
does
not
do
eighteen
months
for
nothing
right
away
raffles
was
saying
we
choose
for
her
and
change
anything
she
do
like
is
that
the
idea
that
was
my
suggestion
sir
then
come
on
ezra
i
guess
you
know
sadie
taste
you
help
me
choose
and
we
chose
lord
what
did
we
not
choose
there
was
her
ring
a
diamond
it
cost
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
get
it
for
then
there
was
a
diamond
necklet
two
hundred
guineas
but
pounds
accepted
that
was
to
be
the
gift
of
the
bridegroom
the
wedding
was
evidently
imminent
it
behooved
me
to
play
a
brotherly
part
i
therefore
rose
to
the
occasion
calculated
she
would
like
a
diamond
star
but
reckoned
it
was
more
than
i
could
afford
and
sustained
a
vicious
kick
under
the
table
for
either
verb
i
was
afraid
to
open
my
mouth
on
finally
obtaining
the
star
for
the
round
hundred
and
then
the
fat
fell
in
the
fire
for
pay
we
could
not
though
a
remittance
said
raffles
was
overdo
from
noo
york
but
i
do
know
you
gentlemen
the
jeweller
exclaimed
i
even
the
name
of
your
hotel
i
told
you
we
was
stoppin
with
friends
said
raffles
who
was
not
angry
though
thwarted
and
crushed
but
that
right
sir
oh
dead
right
and
i
the
last
man
to
ask
you
to
take
quixotic
risks
i
tryin
to
figure
a
way
out
yes
sir
that
what
i
tryin
to
do
i
wish
you
could
sir
the
jeweller
said
with
feeling
it
is
as
if
we
had
seen
the
color
of
your
money
but
certain
rules
sworn
to
observe
it
is
as
if
i
was
in
business
for
myself
and
you
say
you
start
for
paris
in
the
morning
on
the
train
mused
raffles
and
i
heard
yarns
about
the
joolers
stores
in
parrus
but
that
ai
fair
do
you
take
no
notice
o
that
i
tryin
to
figure
a
way
out
yes
sir
he
was
smoking
cigarettes
out
of
a
box
the
tradesman
and
i
had
cigars
raffles
sat
frowning
with
a
pregnant
eye
and
it
was
only
too
clear
to
me
that
his
plans
had
miscarried
i
could
not
help
thinking
however
that
they
deserved
to
do
so
if
he
had
counted
upon
buying
credit
for
all
but
by
a
single
payment
of
some
ten
per
cent
that
again
seemed
unworthy
of
raffles
and
i
for
my
part
still
sat
prepared
to
spring
any
moment
at
our
visitor
throat
we
could
mail
you
the
money
from
parrus
drawled
raffles
at
length
but
how
should
we
know
you
hold
up
your
end
of
the
string
and
mail
us
the
same
articles
we
selected
the
visitor
stiffened
in
his
chair
the
name
of
his
firm
should
be
sufficient
guarantee
for
that
i
guess
i
no
better
acquainted
with
their
name
than
they
are
with
mine
remarked
raffles
laughing
see
here
though
i
got
a
scheme
you
pack
in
this
he
turned
the
cigarettes
out
of
the
tin
box
while
the
jeweller
and
i
joined
wondering
eyes
pack
in
this
repeated
raffles
the
three
things
we
want
and
never
mind
the
boxes
you
can
pack
in
then
we
ring
for
string
and
sealing
wax
seal
up
the
lot
right
here
and
you
can
take
away
in
your
grip
within
three
days
we
have
our
remittance
and
mail
you
the
money
and
you
mail
us
this
darned
box
with
my
seal
unbroken
it
no
use
you
lookin
so
sick
jooler
you
wo
trust
us
any
and
yet
we
goin
to
trust
you
some
ring
the
bell
ezra
and
we
see
if
they
gotten
any
and
string
they
had
and
the
thing
was
done
the
tradesman
did
not
like
it
the
precaution
was
absolutely
unnecessary
but
since
he
was
taking
all
his
goods
away
with
him
the
sold
with
the
unsold
his
sentimental
objections
soon
fell
to
the
ground
he
packed
necklet
ring
and
star
with
his
own
hands
in
and
the
held
them
so
easily
that
at
the
last
moment
when
the
box
was
closed
and
the
string
ready
raffles
very
nearly
added
a
diamond
at
this
temptation
however
he
ultimately
overcame
to
the
other
chagrin
the
was
tied
up
and
the
string
sealed
oddly
enough
with
the
diamond
of
the
ring
that
had
been
bought
and
paid
for
i
chance
you
having
another
ring
in
the
store
the
dead
spit
of
mine
laughed
raffles
as
he
relinquished
the
box
and
it
disappeared
into
the
tradesman
bag
and
now
robinson
i
hope
appreciate
my
true
hospitality
in
not
offering
you
any
thing
to
drink
while
business
was
in
progress
that
chateau
margaux
sir
and
i
should
judge
it
what
you
call
an
article
in
the
cab
which
we
took
to
the
vicinity
of
the
flat
i
was
instantly
snubbed
for
asking
questions
which
the
driver
might
easily
overhear
and
took
the
repulse
just
a
little
to
heart
i
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
raffles
dealings
with
the
man
from
regent
street
and
was
naturally
inquisitive
as
to
the
meaning
of
it
all
but
i
held
my
tongue
until
we
had
regained
the
flat
in
the
cautious
manner
of
our
exit
and
even
there
until
raffles
rallied
me
with
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
and
an
old
smile
upon
his
face
you
rabbit
said
he
why
could
you
wait
till
we
got
home
why
could
you
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
do
i
retorted
as
of
yore
because
your
dear
old
phiz
is
still
worth
its
weight
in
innocence
and
because
you
never
could
act
for
nuts
you
looked
as
puzzled
as
the
other
poor
devil
but
you
would
if
you
had
known
what
my
game
really
was
and
pray
what
was
it
that
said
raffles
and
he
smacked
the
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
it
was
not
tied
it
was
not
sealed
it
flew
open
from
the
force
of
the
impact
and
the
diamond
ring
that
cost
the
necklet
for
and
my
flaming
star
at
another
all
three
lay
safe
and
snug
in
the
jeweller
own
duplicate
boxes
i
cried
duplicate
boxes
my
brainy
bunny
one
was
already
packed
and
weighted
and
in
my
pocket
i
do
know
whether
you
noticed
me
weighing
the
three
things
together
in
my
hand
i
know
that
neither
of
you
saw
me
change
the
boxes
for
i
did
it
when
i
was
nearest
buying
the
at
the
end
and
you
were
too
puzzled
and
the
other
johnny
too
keen
it
was
the
cheapest
shot
in
the
game
the
dear
ones
were
sending
old
theobald
to
southampton
on
a
fool
errand
yesterday
afternoon
and
showing
one
own
nose
down
regent
street
in
broad
daylight
while
he
was
gone
but
some
things
are
worth
paying
for
and
certain
risks
one
must
always
take
nice
boxes
are
they
i
only
wished
they
contained
a
better
cigarette
but
a
notorious
brand
was
essential
a
box
of
sullivans
would
have
brought
me
to
life
but
they
ought
to
open
it
nor
will
they
as
a
matter
of
fact
meanwhile
bunny
i
may
call
upon
you
to
dispose
of
the
boodle
i
on
for
any
mortal
thing
my
voice
rang
true
i
swear
but
it
was
the
way
of
raffles
to
take
the
evidence
of
as
many
senses
as
possible
i
felt
the
cold
steel
of
his
eyes
through
mine
and
through
my
brain
but
what
he
saw
seemed
to
satisfy
him
no
less
than
what
he
heard
for
his
hand
found
my
hand
and
pressed
it
with
a
fervor
foreign
to
the
man
i
know
you
are
and
i
knew
you
would
be
only
remember
bunny
my
turn
next
to
pay
the
shot
you
shall
hear
how
he
paid
it
when
the
time
came
a
jubilee
present
the
room
of
gold
in
the
british
museum
is
probably
well
enough
known
to
the
inquiring
alien
and
the
travelled
american
a
true
londoner
however
i
myself
had
never
heard
of
it
until
raffles
casually
proposed
a
raid
the
older
i
grow
bunny
the
less
i
think
of
your
precious
stones
when
did
they
ever
bring
in
half
their
market
value
in
there
was
the
first
little
crib
we
ever
cracked
together
you
with
your
innocent
eyes
shut
a
thousand
pounds
that
stuff
was
worth
but
how
many
hundreds
did
it
actually
fetch
the
ardagh
emeralds
much
better
old
lady
melrose
necklace
was
far
worse
but
that
little
lot
the
other
night
has
about
finished
me
a
cool
hundred
for
goods
priced
well
over
four
and
to
come
off
for
bait
since
we
only
got
a
tenner
for
the
ring
i
bought
and
paid
for
like
an
ass
i
be
shot
if
i
ever
touch
a
diamond
again
not
if
it
was
the
those
few
whacking
stones
are
too
well
known
and
to
cut
them
up
is
to
decrease
their
value
by
arithmetical
retrogression
besides
that
brings
you
up
against
the
fence
once
more
and
i
done
with
the
beggars
for
good
and
all
you
talk
about
your
editors
and
publishers
you
literary
swine
barabbas
was
neither
a
robber
nor
a
publisher
but
a
fence
what
we
really
want
is
an
incorporated
society
of
thieves
with
some
old
forger
to
run
it
for
us
on
business
lines
raffles
uttered
these
blasphemies
under
his
breath
not
i
am
afraid
out
of
any
respect
for
my
one
redeeming
profession
but
because
we
were
taking
a
midnight
airing
on
the
roof
after
a
whole
day
of
june
in
the
little
flat
below
the
stars
shone
overhead
the
lights
of
london
underneath
and
between
the
lips
of
raffles
a
cigarette
of
the
old
and
only
brand
i
had
sent
in
secret
for
a
box
of
the
best
the
boon
had
arrived
that
night
and
the
foregoing
speech
was
the
first
result
i
could
afford
to
ignore
the
insolent
asides
however
where
the
apparent
contention
was
so
manifestly
unsound
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
rid
of
your
gold
said
i
pertinently
nothing
easier
my
dear
rabbit
is
your
room
of
gold
a
roomful
of
sovereigns
raffles
laughed
softly
at
my
scorn
no
bunny
it
principally
in
the
shape
of
archaic
ornaments
whose
value
i
admit
is
largely
extrinsic
but
gold
is
gold
from
phoenicia
to
klondike
and
if
we
cleared
the
room
we
should
eventually
do
very
well
how
i
should
melt
it
down
into
a
nugget
and
bring
it
home
from
the
and
then
make
them
pay
up
in
hard
cash
across
the
counter
of
the
bank
of
england
and
you
can
make
them
that
i
knew
and
so
said
nothing
for
a
time
remaining
a
hostile
though
a
silent
critic
while
we
paced
the
cool
black
leads
with
our
bare
feet
softly
as
cats
and
how
do
you
propose
to
get
enough
away
at
length
i
asked
to
make
it
worth
while
ah
there
you
have
it
said
raffles
i
only
propose
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
to
see
what
we
can
see
we
might
find
some
for
a
night
that
i
am
afraid
would
be
our
only
chance
have
you
ever
been
there
before
not
since
they
got
the
one
good
portable
piece
which
i
believe
that
they
exhibit
now
it
a
long
time
since
i
read
of
it
i
remember
where
but
i
know
they
have
got
a
gold
cup
of
sorts
worth
several
thousands
a
number
of
the
immorally
rich
clubbed
together
and
presented
it
to
the
nation
and
two
of
the
richly
immoral
intend
to
snaffle
it
for
themselves
at
any
rate
we
might
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
bunny
do
you
think
think
i
seized
his
arm
when
when
when
i
asked
like
a
gun
the
sooner
the
better
while
old
theobald
away
on
his
honeymoon
our
medico
had
married
the
week
before
nor
was
any
taking
his
work
at
least
not
that
considerable
branch
of
it
which
consisted
of
raffles
during
his
brief
absence
from
town
there
were
reasons
delightfully
obvious
to
us
why
such
a
plan
would
have
been
highly
unwise
in
theobald
i
however
was
sending
him
daily
screeds
and
both
matutinal
and
nocturnal
telegrams
the
composition
of
which
afforded
raffles
not
a
little
enjoyment
well
then
when
when
i
began
to
repeat
if
you
like
only
to
look
the
limitation
was
my
one
regret
we
must
do
so
bunny
before
we
leap
very
well
i
sighed
but
it
is
and
the
morrow
it
really
was
i
saw
the
porter
that
night
and
i
still
think
bought
his
absolute
allegiance
for
the
second
coin
of
the
realm
my
story
however
invented
by
raffles
was
sufficiently
specious
in
itself
that
sick
gentleman
maturin
as
i
had
to
remember
to
call
him
was
really
or
apparently
sickening
for
fresh
air
theobald
would
allow
him
none
he
was
pestering
me
for
just
one
day
in
the
country
while
the
glorious
weather
lasted
i
was
myself
convinced
that
no
possible
harm
could
come
of
the
experiment
would
the
porter
help
me
in
so
innocent
and
meritorious
an
intrigue
the
man
hesitated
i
produced
my
the
man
was
lost
and
at
eight
next
morning
before
the
heat
of
the
day
raffles
and
i
drove
to
kew
gardens
in
a
hired
landau
which
was
to
call
for
us
at
and
wait
until
we
came
the
porter
had
assisted
me
to
carry
my
invalid
downstairs
in
a
hired
like
the
landau
from
harrod
stores
for
the
occasion
it
was
little
after
nine
when
we
crawled
together
into
the
gardens
by
my
invalid
had
had
enough
and
out
he
tottered
on
my
arm
a
cab
a
message
to
our
coachman
a
timely
train
to
baker
street
another
cab
and
we
were
at
the
british
museum
brisk
pedestrians
now
not
very
many
minutes
after
the
opening
hour
of
it
was
one
of
those
glowing
days
which
will
not
be
forgotten
by
many
who
were
in
town
at
the
time
the
diamond
jubilee
was
upon
us
and
queen
weather
had
already
set
in
raffles
indeed
declared
it
was
as
hot
as
italy
and
australia
put
together
and
certainly
the
short
summer
nights
gave
the
channels
of
wood
and
asphalt
and
the
continents
of
brick
and
mortar
but
little
time
to
cool
at
the
british
museum
the
pigeons
were
crooning
among
the
shadows
of
the
grimy
colonnade
and
the
stalwart
janitors
looked
less
stalwart
than
usual
as
though
their
medals
were
too
heavy
for
them
i
recognized
some
habitual
readers
going
to
their
labor
underneath
the
dome
of
mere
visitors
we
seemed
among
the
first
that
the
room
said
raffles
who
had
bought
the
guide
as
we
studied
it
openly
on
the
nearest
bench
number
upstairs
and
sharp
round
to
the
right
come
on
bunny
and
he
led
the
way
in
silence
but
with
a
long
methodical
stride
which
i
could
not
understand
until
we
came
to
the
corridor
leading
to
the
room
of
gold
when
he
turned
to
me
for
a
moment
a
hundred
and
yards
from
this
to
the
open
street
said
raffles
not
counting
the
stairs
i
suppose
we
could
do
it
in
twenty
seconds
but
if
we
did
we
should
have
to
jump
the
gates
no
you
must
remember
to
loaf
out
at
slow
march
bunny
whether
you
like
it
or
not
but
you
talked
about
a
for
a
night
quite
so
for
all
night
we
should
have
to
get
back
go
on
lying
low
and
saunter
out
with
the
crowd
next
day
after
doing
the
whole
show
thoroughly
what
with
gold
in
our
pockets
and
gold
in
our
boots
and
gold
up
the
sleeves
and
legs
of
our
suits
you
leave
that
to
me
bunny
and
wait
till
you
tried
two
pairs
of
trousers
sewn
together
at
the
foot
this
is
only
a
preliminary
reconnoitre
and
here
we
are
it
is
none
of
my
business
to
describe
the
room
of
gold
with
which
i
for
one
was
not
a
little
disappointed
the
glass
cases
which
both
fill
and
line
it
may
contain
unique
examples
of
the
goldsmith
art
in
times
and
places
of
which
one
heard
quite
enough
in
the
course
of
one
classical
education
but
from
a
professional
point
of
view
i
would
as
lief
have
the
ransacking
of
a
single
window
in
the
west
end
as
the
pick
of
all
those
spoils
of
etruria
and
of
ancient
greece
the
gold
may
not
be
so
soft
as
it
appears
but
it
certainly
looks
as
though
you
could
bite
off
the
business
ends
of
the
spoons
and
stop
your
own
teeth
in
doing
so
nor
should
i
care
to
be
seen
wearing
one
of
the
rings
but
the
greatest
fraud
of
all
from
the
aforesaid
standpoint
is
assuredly
that
very
cup
of
which
raffles
had
spoken
moreover
he
felt
this
himself
why
it
as
thin
as
paper
said
he
and
enamelled
like
a
lady
of
quality
but
by
jove
it
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
bunny
i
should
like
to
have
it
for
its
own
sake
by
all
my
gods
the
thing
had
a
little
square
case
of
all
to
itself
at
one
end
of
the
room
it
may
have
been
the
thing
of
beauty
that
raffles
affected
to
consider
it
but
i
for
my
part
was
in
no
mood
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
underneath
were
the
names
of
the
plutocrats
who
had
subscribed
for
this
national
gewgaw
and
i
fell
to
wondering
where
their
came
in
while
raffles
devoured
his
as
greedily
as
a
with
a
zeal
for
culture
those
are
scenes
from
the
martyrdom
of
agnes
said
he
on
relief
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
its
kind
i
should
think
it
was
bunny
you
philistine
why
ca
you
admire
the
thing
for
its
own
sake
it
would
be
worth
having
only
to
live
up
to
there
never
was
such
rich
enamelling
on
such
thin
gold
and
what
a
good
scheme
to
hang
the
lid
up
over
it
so
that
you
can
see
how
thin
it
is
i
wonder
if
we
could
lift
it
bunny
by
hook
or
crook
you
better
try
sir
said
a
dry
voice
at
his
elbow
the
madman
seemed
to
think
we
had
the
room
to
ourselves
i
knew
better
but
like
another
madman
had
let
him
ramble
on
unchecked
and
here
was
a
stolid
constable
confronting
us
in
the
short
tunic
that
they
wear
in
summer
his
whistle
on
its
chain
but
no
truncheon
at
his
side
heavens
how
i
see
him
now
a
man
of
medium
size
with
a
broad
perspiring
face
and
a
limp
moustache
he
looked
sternly
at
raffles
and
raffles
looked
merrily
at
him
going
to
run
me
in
officer
said
he
that
would
be
a
joke
my
hat
i
did
say
as
i
was
sir
replied
the
policeman
but
that
queer
talk
for
a
gentleman
like
you
sir
in
the
british
museum
and
he
wagged
his
helmet
at
my
invalid
who
had
taken
his
airing
in
and
the
more
readily
to
assume
his
present
part
what
cried
raffles
simply
saying
to
my
friend
that
i
like
to
lift
the
gold
cup
why
so
i
should
officer
so
i
should
i
mind
who
hears
me
say
so
it
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
life
the
constable
face
had
already
relaxed
and
now
a
grin
peeped
under
the
limp
moustache
i
daresay
there
many
as
feels
like
that
sir
said
he
exactly
and
i
say
what
i
feel
that
all
said
raffles
airily
but
seriously
officer
is
a
valuable
thing
like
this
quite
safe
in
a
case
like
that
safe
enough
as
long
as
i
here
replied
the
other
between
grim
jest
and
stout
earnest
raffles
studied
his
face
he
was
still
watching
raffles
and
i
kept
an
eye
on
them
both
without
putting
in
my
word
you
appear
to
be
observed
raffles
is
that
wise
the
note
of
anxiety
was
capitally
caught
it
was
at
once
personal
and
that
of
the
enthusiastic
savant
afraid
for
a
national
treasure
which
few
appreciated
as
he
did
himself
and
to
be
sure
the
three
of
us
now
had
this
treasury
to
ourselves
one
or
two
others
had
been
there
when
we
entered
but
now
they
were
gone
i
not
said
the
officer
comfortably
see
that
seat
by
the
door
one
of
the
attendants
sits
there
all
day
long
then
where
is
he
now
talking
to
another
attendant
just
outside
if
you
listen
you
hear
them
for
yourself
we
listened
and
we
did
hear
them
but
not
just
outside
in
my
own
mind
i
even
questioned
whether
they
were
in
the
corridor
through
which
we
had
come
to
me
it
sounded
as
though
they
were
just
outside
the
corridor
you
mean
the
fellow
with
the
who
was
here
when
we
came
in
pursued
raffles
that
was
a
it
was
a
pointer
the
intelligent
officer
explained
it
ought
to
be
a
javelin
said
raffles
nervously
it
ought
to
be
a
poleaxe
the
public
treasure
ought
to
be
better
guarded
than
this
i
shall
write
to
the
times
about
it
you
see
if
i
do
all
at
once
yet
somehow
not
so
suddenly
as
to
excite
suspicion
raffles
had
become
the
elderly
busybody
with
nerves
why
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
and
the
policeman
seemed
equally
at
sea
lor
bless
you
sir
said
he
i
all
right
do
you
bother
your
head
about
me
but
you
have
even
got
a
truncheon
not
likely
to
want
one
either
you
see
sir
it
early
as
yet
in
a
few
minutes
these
here
rooms
will
fill
up
and
there
safety
in
numbers
as
they
say
oh
it
will
fill
up
soon
will
it
any
minute
now
sir
ah
it
is
often
empty
as
long
as
this
sir
it
the
jubilee
i
suppose
meanwhile
what
if
my
friend
and
i
had
been
professional
thieves
why
we
could
have
you
in
an
instant
my
good
fellow
that
you
could
leastways
not
without
bringing
the
whole
place
about
your
ears
well
i
shall
write
to
the
times
all
the
same
i
a
connoisseur
in
all
this
sort
of
thing
and
i
wo
have
unnecessary
risks
run
with
the
nation
property
you
said
there
was
an
attendant
just
outside
but
he
sounds
to
me
as
though
he
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
i
shall
write
for
an
instant
we
all
three
listened
and
raffles
was
right
then
i
saw
two
things
in
one
glance
raffles
had
stepped
a
few
inches
backward
and
stood
poised
upon
the
ball
of
each
foot
his
arms
half
raised
a
light
in
his
eyes
and
another
kind
of
light
was
breaking
over
the
crass
features
of
our
friend
the
constable
then
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
cried
with
a
sudden
clutch
at
the
on
his
chest
the
whistle
flew
out
but
it
never
reached
his
lips
there
were
a
couple
of
sharp
smacks
like
double
barrels
discharged
all
but
simultaneously
and
the
man
reeled
against
me
so
that
i
could
not
help
catching
him
as
he
fell
well
done
bunny
i
knocked
him
out
i
knocked
him
out
run
you
to
the
door
and
see
if
the
attendants
have
heard
anything
and
take
them
on
if
they
have
mechanically
i
did
as
i
was
told
there
was
no
time
for
thought
still
less
for
remonstrance
or
reproach
though
my
surprise
must
have
been
even
more
complete
than
that
of
the
constable
before
raffles
knocked
the
sense
out
of
him
even
in
my
utter
bewilderment
however
the
instinctive
caution
of
the
real
criminal
did
not
desert
me
i
ran
to
the
door
but
i
sauntered
through
it
to
plant
myself
before
a
pompeiian
fresco
in
the
corridor
and
there
were
the
two
attendants
still
gossiping
outside
the
further
door
nor
did
they
hear
the
dull
crash
which
i
heard
even
as
i
watched
them
out
of
the
corner
of
each
eye
it
was
hot
weather
as
i
have
said
but
the
perspiration
on
my
body
seemed
already
to
have
turned
into
a
skin
of
ice
then
i
caught
the
faint
reflection
of
my
own
face
in
the
casing
of
the
fresco
and
it
frightened
me
into
some
semblance
of
myself
as
raffles
joined
me
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
but
my
fear
and
indignation
were
redoubled
at
the
sight
of
him
when
a
single
glance
convinced
me
that
his
pockets
were
as
empty
as
his
hands
and
his
mad
outrage
the
most
wanton
and
reckless
of
his
whole
career
ah
very
interesting
very
interesting
but
nothing
to
what
they
have
in
the
museum
at
naples
or
in
pompeii
itself
you
must
go
there
some
day
bunny
i
a
good
mind
to
take
you
myself
meanwhile
slow
march
the
beggar
has
moved
an
eyelid
we
may
swing
for
him
if
you
show
indecent
haste
we
i
whispered
we
and
my
knees
knocked
together
as
we
came
up
to
the
chatting
attendants
but
raffles
must
needs
interrupt
them
to
ask
the
way
to
the
prehistoric
saloon
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
thank
you
then
we
work
round
that
way
to
the
egyptian
part
and
we
left
them
resuming
their
providential
chat
i
believe
you
mad
i
said
bitterly
as
we
went
i
believe
i
was
admitted
raffles
but
i
not
now
and
i
see
you
through
a
hundred
and
yards
was
it
then
it
ca
be
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
now
not
as
much
steady
bunny
for
god
sake
it
slow
march
for
our
lives
there
was
this
much
management
the
rest
was
our
colossal
luck
a
hansom
was
being
paid
off
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
outside
and
in
we
jumped
raffles
shouting
charing
cross
for
all
bloomsbury
to
hear
we
had
turned
into
bloomsbury
street
without
exchanging
a
syllable
when
he
struck
the
with
his
fist
where
the
devil
are
you
driving
us
charing
cross
sir
i
said
king
cross
round
you
spin
and
drive
like
blazes
or
we
miss
our
train
there
one
to
york
at
added
raffles
as
the
slammed
we
book
there
bunny
and
then
we
slope
through
the
subway
to
the
metropolitan
and
so
to
ground
via
baker
street
and
earl
court
and
actually
in
half
an
hour
he
was
seated
once
more
in
the
hired
carrying
chair
while
the
porter
and
i
staggered
upstairs
with
my
decrepit
charge
for
whose
shattered
strength
even
one
hour
in
kew
gardens
had
proved
too
much
then
and
not
until
then
when
we
had
got
rid
of
the
porter
and
were
alone
at
last
did
i
tell
raffles
in
the
most
nervous
english
at
my
command
frankly
and
exactly
what
i
thought
of
him
and
of
his
latest
deed
once
started
moreover
i
spoke
as
i
have
seldom
spoken
to
living
man
and
raffles
of
all
men
stood
my
abuse
without
a
murmur
or
rather
he
sat
it
out
too
astounded
even
to
take
off
his
hat
though
i
thought
his
eyebrows
would
have
lifted
it
from
his
head
but
it
always
was
your
infernal
way
i
was
savagely
concluding
you
make
one
plan
and
yet
you
tell
me
another
not
bunny
i
swear
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
really
did
start
with
the
bare
idea
of
finding
a
place
to
hide
in
for
a
night
of
course
i
did
it
was
to
be
the
mere
reconnoitre
you
pretended
there
was
no
pretence
about
it
bunny
then
why
on
earth
go
and
do
what
you
did
the
reason
would
be
obvious
to
anyone
but
you
said
raffles
still
with
no
unkindly
scorn
it
was
the
temptation
of
a
minute
the
final
impulse
of
the
fraction
of
a
second
when
roberto
saw
that
i
was
tempted
and
let
me
see
that
he
saw
it
it
not
a
thing
i
care
to
do
and
i
be
happy
till
the
papers
tell
me
the
poor
devil
is
alive
but
a
shot
was
the
only
chance
for
us
then
why
you
do
get
run
in
for
being
tempted
nor
yet
for
showing
that
you
are
but
i
should
have
deserved
running
in
if
i
had
yielded
to
such
a
temptation
as
that
bunny
it
was
a
chance
in
a
hundred
thousand
we
might
go
there
every
day
of
our
lives
and
never
again
be
the
only
outsiders
in
the
room
with
the
johnnie
practically
out
of
at
one
and
the
same
time
it
was
a
gift
from
the
gods
not
to
have
taken
it
would
have
been
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
but
you
did
take
it
said
i
you
went
and
left
it
behind
i
wish
i
had
had
a
kodak
for
the
little
smile
with
which
raffles
shook
his
head
for
it
was
one
that
he
kept
for
those
great
moments
of
which
our
vocation
is
not
devoid
all
this
time
he
had
been
wearing
his
hat
tilted
a
little
over
eyebrows
no
longer
raised
and
now
at
last
i
knew
where
the
gold
cup
was
it
stood
for
days
upon
his
this
costly
trophy
whose
ancient
history
and
final
fate
filled
newspaper
columns
even
in
these
days
of
jubilee
and
for
which
the
flower
of
scotland
yard
was
said
to
be
seeking
high
and
low
our
constable
we
learnt
had
been
stunned
only
and
from
the
moment
that
i
brought
him
an
evening
paper
with
the
news
raffles
spirits
rose
to
a
height
inconsistent
with
his
equable
temperament
and
as
unusual
in
him
as
the
sudden
impulse
upon
which
he
had
acted
with
such
effect
the
cup
itself
appealed
to
me
no
more
than
it
had
done
before
exquisite
it
might
be
handsome
it
was
but
so
light
in
the
hand
that
the
mere
gold
of
it
would
scarcely
have
poured
three
figures
out
of
and
what
said
raffles
but
that
he
would
never
melt
it
at
all
taking
it
was
an
offence
against
the
laws
of
the
land
bunny
that
is
nothing
but
destroying
it
would
be
a
crime
against
god
and
art
and
may
i
be
spitted
on
the
vane
of
mary
abbot
if
i
commit
it
talk
such
as
this
was
unanswerable
indeed
the
whole
affair
had
passed
the
pale
of
useful
comment
and
the
one
course
left
to
a
practical
person
was
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
enjoy
the
joke
this
was
not
a
little
enhanced
by
the
newspaper
reports
which
described
raffles
as
a
handsome
youth
and
his
unwilling
accomplice
as
an
older
man
of
blackguardly
appearance
and
low
type
hits
us
both
off
rather
neatly
bunny
said
he
but
what
none
of
them
do
justice
to
is
my
dear
cup
look
at
it
only
look
at
it
man
was
ever
anything
so
rich
and
yet
so
chaste
agnes
must
have
had
a
pretty
bad
time
but
it
would
be
almost
worth
it
to
go
down
to
posterity
in
such
enamel
upon
such
gold
and
then
the
history
of
the
thing
do
you
realize
that
it
five
hundred
years
old
and
has
belonged
to
henry
the
eighth
and
to
elizabeth
among
others
bunny
when
you
have
me
cremated
you
can
put
my
ashes
in
yonder
cup
and
lay
us
in
the
earth
together
and
meanwhile
it
is
the
joy
of
my
heart
the
light
of
my
life
the
delight
of
mine
eye
and
suppose
other
eyes
catch
sight
of
it
they
never
must
they
never
shall
raffles
would
have
been
too
absurd
had
he
not
been
thoroughly
alive
to
his
own
absurdity
there
was
nevertheless
an
underlying
sincerity
in
his
appreciation
of
any
and
every
form
of
beauty
which
all
his
nonsense
could
not
conceal
and
his
infatuation
for
the
cup
was
as
he
declared
a
very
pure
passion
since
the
circumstances
debarred
him
from
the
chief
joy
of
the
average
collector
that
of
showing
his
treasure
to
his
friends
at
last
however
and
at
the
height
of
his
craze
raffles
and
reason
seemed
to
come
together
again
as
suddenly
as
they
had
parted
company
in
the
room
of
gold
bunny
he
cried
flinging
his
newspaper
across
the
room
i
got
an
idea
after
your
own
heart
i
know
where
i
can
place
it
after
all
do
you
mean
the
cup
i
do
then
i
congratulate
you
thanks
upon
the
recovery
of
your
senses
thanks
galore
but
you
been
confoundedly
unsympathetic
about
this
thing
bunny
and
i
do
think
i
shall
tell
you
my
scheme
till
carried
it
out
quite
time
enough
said
i
it
will
mean
your
letting
me
loose
for
an
hour
or
two
under
cloud
of
this
very
night
sunday
the
jubilee
on
tuesday
and
old
theobald
coming
back
for
it
it
does
much
matter
whether
he
back
or
not
if
you
go
late
enough
i
must
be
late
they
do
keep
open
no
it
no
use
your
asking
any
questions
go
out
and
buy
me
a
big
box
of
huntley
biscuits
any
sort
you
like
only
they
must
be
theirs
and
absolutely
the
biggest
box
they
sell
my
dear
man
no
questions
bunny
you
do
your
part
and
i
do
mine
subtlety
and
success
were
in
his
face
it
was
enough
for
me
and
i
had
done
his
extraordinary
bidding
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
another
minute
raffles
had
opened
the
box
and
tumbled
all
the
biscuits
into
the
nearest
chair
now
newspapers
i
fetched
a
pile
he
bid
the
cup
of
gold
a
ridiculous
farewell
wrapped
it
up
in
newspaper
after
newspaper
and
finally
packed
it
in
the
empty
now
some
brown
paper
i
do
want
to
be
taken
for
the
grocer
young
man
a
neat
enough
parcel
it
made
when
the
string
had
been
tied
and
the
ends
cut
close
what
was
more
difficult
was
to
wrap
up
raffles
himself
in
such
a
way
that
even
the
porter
should
not
recognize
him
if
they
came
face
to
face
at
the
corner
and
the
sun
was
still
up
but
raffles
would
go
and
when
he
did
i
should
not
have
known
him
myself
he
may
have
been
an
hour
away
it
was
barely
dusk
when
he
returned
and
my
first
question
referred
to
our
dangerous
ally
the
porter
raffles
had
passed
him
unsuspected
in
going
but
had
managed
to
avoid
him
altogether
on
the
return
journey
which
he
had
completed
by
way
of
the
other
entrance
and
the
roof
i
breathed
again
and
what
have
you
done
with
the
cup
placed
it
how
much
for
how
much
for
let
me
think
i
had
a
couple
of
cabs
and
the
postage
was
a
tanner
with
another
twopence
for
registration
yes
it
cost
me
exactly
it
cost
you
but
what
did
you
get
for
it
raffles
nothing
my
boy
nothing
not
a
crimson
cent
i
am
not
surprised
i
never
thought
it
had
a
market
value
i
told
you
so
in
the
beginning
i
said
irritably
but
what
on
earth
have
you
done
with
the
thing
sent
it
to
the
queen
you
have
rogue
is
a
word
with
various
meanings
and
raffles
had
been
one
sort
of
rogue
ever
since
i
had
known
him
but
now
for
once
he
was
the
innocent
variety
a
great
child
running
over
with
merriment
and
mischief
well
i
sent
it
to
sir
arthur
bigge
to
present
to
her
majesty
with
the
loyal
respects
of
the
thief
if
that
will
do
for
you
said
raffles
i
thought
they
might
take
too
much
stock
of
me
at
the
if
i
addressed
it
to
the
sovereign
yes
i
drove
over
to
with
it
and
i
registered
the
box
into
the
bargain
do
a
thing
properly
if
you
do
it
at
all
but
why
on
earth
i
groaned
do
such
a
thing
at
all
my
dear
bunny
we
have
been
reigned
over
for
sixty
years
by
infinitely
the
finest
monarch
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
world
is
taking
the
present
opportunity
of
signifying
the
fact
for
all
it
is
worth
every
nation
is
laying
of
its
best
at
her
royal
feet
every
class
in
the
community
is
doing
its
little
level
except
ours
all
i
have
done
is
to
remove
one
reproach
from
our
fraternity
at
this
i
came
round
was
infected
with
his
spirit
called
him
the
sportsman
he
always
was
and
would
be
and
shook
his
daredevil
hand
in
mine
but
at
the
same
time
i
still
had
my
qualms
supposing
they
trace
it
to
us
said
i
there
not
much
to
catch
hold
of
in
a
by
huntley
palmer
replied
raffles
that
was
why
i
sent
you
for
one
and
i
did
write
a
word
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
which
could
possibly
be
traced
i
simply
printed
two
or
three
on
a
virginal
another
to
the
bad
which
might
have
been
bought
at
any
in
the
kingdom
no
old
chap
the
was
the
one
real
danger
there
was
one
detective
i
spotted
for
myself
and
the
sight
of
him
has
left
me
with
a
thirst
whisky
and
sullivans
for
two
bunny
if
you
please
raffles
was
soon
clinking
his
glass
against
mine
the
queen
said
he
god
bless
her
the
fate
of
faustina
mar
ga

cchieu
a
was
pouring
the
metallic
music
through
our
open
windows
while
a
voice
of
brass
brayed
the
words
which
i
have
since
obtained
and
print
above
for
identification
by
such
as
know
their
italy
better
than
i
they
will
not
thank
me
for
reminding
them
of
a
tune
so
lately
epidemic
in
that
land
of
aloes
and
blue
skies
but
at
least
it
is
unlikely
to
run
in
their
heads
as
the
ribald
accompaniment
to
a
tragedy
and
it
does
in
mine
it
was
in
the
early
heat
of
august
and
the
hour
that
of
the
lawful
and
necessary
siesta
for
such
as
turn
night
into
day
i
was
therefore
shutting
my
window
in
a
rage
and
wondering
whether
i
should
not
do
the
same
for
raffles
when
he
appeared
in
the
silk
pajamas
to
which
the
chronic
solicitude
of
theobald
confined
him
from
morning
to
night
do
do
that
bunny
said
he
i
rather
like
that
thing
and
want
to
listen
what
sort
of
fellows
are
they
to
look
at
by
the
way
i
put
my
head
out
to
see
it
being
a
primary
rule
of
our
quaint
establishment
that
raffles
must
never
show
himself
at
any
of
the
windows
i
remember
now
how
hot
the
sill
was
to
my
elbows
as
i
leant
upon
it
and
looked
down
in
order
to
satisfy
a
curiosity
in
which
i
could
see
no
point
beggars
said
i
over
my
shoulder
dark
as
dark
blue
chins
oleaginous
curls
and
ragged
as
they
make
them
but
nothing
picturesque
in
their
rags
neapolitans
all
over
murmured
raffles
behind
me
and
that
a
characteristic
touch
the
one
fellow
singing
while
the
other
grinds
they
always
have
that
out
there
he
rather
a
fine
chap
the
singer
said
i
as
the
song
ended
my
hat
what
teeth
he
looking
up
here
and
grinning
all
round
his
head
shall
i
chuck
him
anything
well
i
have
no
reason
to
love
the
neapolitans
but
it
takes
me
back
it
takes
me
back
yes
here
you
are
one
each
it
was
a
couple
of
that
raffles
put
into
my
hand
but
i
had
thrown
them
into
the
street
for
pennies
before
i
saw
what
they
were
thereupon
i
left
the
italians
bowing
to
the
mud
as
well
they
might
and
i
turned
to
protest
against
such
wanton
waste
but
raffles
was
walking
up
and
down
his
head
bent
his
eyes
troubled
and
his
one
excuse
disarmed
remonstrance
they
took
me
back
he
repeated
my
god
how
they
took
me
back
suddenly
he
stopped
in
his
stride
you
do
understand
bunny
old
chap
but
if
you
like
you
shall
i
always
meant
to
tell
you
some
day
but
never
felt
worked
up
to
it
before
and
it
not
the
kind
of
thing
one
talks
about
for
sake
it
is
a
nursery
story
bunny
and
there
is
a
laugh
in
it
from
start
to
finish
on
the
contrary
you
have
often
asked
me
what
turned
my
hair
gray
and
now
you
are
going
to
hear
this
was
promising
but
raffles
manner
was
something
more
it
was
unique
in
my
memory
of
the
man
his
fine
face
softened
and
set
hard
by
turns
i
never
knew
it
so
hard
i
never
knew
it
so
soft
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
his
voice
now
tender
as
any
woman
now
flying
to
the
other
extreme
of
equally
unwonted
ferocity
but
this
was
toward
the
end
of
his
tale
the
beginning
he
treated
characteristically
enough
though
i
could
have
wished
for
a
less
cavalier
account
of
the
island
of
elba
where
upon
his
own
showing
he
had
met
with
much
humanity
deadly
my
dear
bunny
is
not
the
word
for
that
glorified
snag
or
for
the
mollusks
its
inhabitants
but
they
started
by
wounding
my
vanity
so
perhaps
i
am
prejudiced
after
all
i
sprung
myself
upon
them
as
a
shipwrecked
sailor
a
sole
survivor
stripped
in
the
sea
and
landed
without
a
stitch
yet
they
took
no
more
interest
in
me
than
you
do
in
italian
they
were
decent
enough
i
did
have
to
pick
and
steal
for
a
square
meal
and
a
pair
of
trousers
it
would
have
been
more
exciting
if
i
had
but
what
a
place
napoleon
stand
it
you
remember
but
he
held
on
longer
than
i
did
i
put
in
a
few
weeks
in
their
infernal
mines
simply
to
pick
up
a
smattering
of
italian
then
got
across
to
the
mainland
in
a
little
wooden
and
ungratefully
glad
i
was
to
leave
elba
blazing
in
just
such
another
sunset
as
the
one
you
wo
forget
the
tramp
was
bound
for
naples
but
first
it
touched
at
baiae
where
i
carefully
deserted
in
the
night
there
are
too
many
english
in
naples
itself
though
i
thought
it
would
make
a
first
happy
when
i
knew
the
language
better
and
had
altered
myself
a
bit
more
meanwhile
i
got
a
billet
of
several
sorts
on
one
of
the
loveliest
spots
that
ever
i
struck
on
all
my
travels
the
place
was
a
vineyard
but
it
overhung
the
sea
and
i
got
taken
on
as
tame
sailorman
and
emergency
the
wages
were
the
noble
figure
of
a
lira
and
a
half
which
is
just
over
a
bob
a
day
but
there
were
lashings
of
sound
wine
for
one
and
all
and
better
wine
to
bathe
in
and
for
eight
whole
months
my
boy
i
was
an
absolutely
honest
man
the
luxury
of
it
bunny
i
herod
would
touch
a
grape
and
went
in
the
most
delicious
danger
of
being
knifed
for
my
principles
by
the
thieving
crew
i
had
joined
it
was
the
kind
of
place
where
every
prospect
pleases
and
all
the
rest
of
it
especially
all
the
rest
but
may
i
see
it
in
my
dreams
till
i
die
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
before
anything
began
to
happen
it
was
a
wedge
of
rock
sticking
out
into
the
bay
thatched
with
vines
and
with
the
rummiest
old
house
on
the
very
edge
of
all
a
devil
of
a
height
above
the
sea
you
might
have
sat
at
the
windows
and
dropped
your
plumb
into
blue
water
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
below
from
the
garden
behind
the
house
such
a
garden
bunny
oleanders
and
mimosa
myrtles
rosemarys
and
red
tangles
of
fiery
untamed
flowers
in
a
corner
of
this
garden
was
the
top
of
a
subterranean
stair
down
to
the
sea
at
least
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
steps
tunnelled
through
the
solid
rock
then
an
iron
gate
and
another
eighty
steps
in
the
open
air
and
last
of
all
a
cave
fit
for
pirates
this
cave
gave
upon
the
sweetest
little
thing
in
coves
all
deep
blue
water
and
honest
rocks
and
here
i
looked
after
the
vineyard
shipping
a
tub
with
a
brown
sail
and
a
sort
of
dingy
the
tub
took
the
wine
to
naples
and
the
dingy
was
the
tub
tender
the
house
above
was
said
to
be
on
the
identical
site
of
a
suburban
retreat
of
the
admirable
tiberius
there
was
the
old
sinner
private
theatre
with
the
tiers
cut
clean
to
this
day
the
well
where
he
used
to
fatten
his
lampreys
on
his
slaves
and
a
ruined
temple
of
those
ripping
old
roman
bricks
shallow
as
dominoes
and
ruddier
than
the
cherry
i
never
was
much
of
an
antiquary
but
i
could
have
become
one
there
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
i
had
lots
when
i
busy
with
the
boats
i
had
to
trim
the
vines
or
gather
the
grapes
or
even
help
make
the
wine
itself
in
a
cool
dark
musty
vault
underneath
the
temple
that
i
can
see
and
smell
as
i
jaw
and
ca
i
hear
it
and
feel
it
too
squish
squash
bubble
squash
squish
guggle
and
your
feet
as
though
you
had
been
wading
through
slaughter
to
a
throne
yes
bunny
you
might
think
it
but
this
good
right
foot
that
never
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
crease
when
the
ball
left
my
hand
has
also
been
known
to
the
lees
of
pleasure
from
sanguine
grapes
of
pain
he
made
a
sudden
pause
as
though
he
had
stumbled
on
the
truth
in
jest
his
face
filled
with
lines
we
were
sitting
in
the
room
that
had
been
bare
when
first
i
saw
it
there
were
and
a
table
in
it
now
all
meant
ostensibly
for
me
and
hence
raffles
would
slip
to
his
bed
with
schoolboy
relish
at
every
tinkle
of
the
bell
this
afternoon
we
felt
fairly
safe
for
theobald
had
called
in
the
morning
and
theobald
still
took
up
much
of
his
time
through
the
open
window
we
could
hear
the
and
mar
gar
ri
a
few
hundred
yards
further
on
i
fancied
raffles
was
listening
to
it
while
he
paused
he
shook
his
head
abstractedly
when
i
handed
him
the
cigarettes
and
his
tone
hereafter
was
never
just
what
it
had
been
i
do
know
bunny
whether
you
a
believer
in
transmigration
of
souls
i
have
often
thought
it
easier
to
believe
than
lots
of
other
things
and
i
have
been
pretty
near
believing
in
it
myself
since
i
had
my
being
on
that
villa
of
tiberius
the
brute
who
had
it
in
my
day
if
he
is
still
running
it
with
a
whole
skin
was
or
is
as
a
blackguard
as
the
worst
of
the
emperors
but
i
have
often
thought
he
had
a
lot
in
common
with
tiberius
he
had
the
great
high
sensual
roman
nose
eyes
that
were
sinks
of
iniquity
in
themselves
and
that
swelled
with
fatness
like
the
rest
of
him
so
that
he
wheezed
if
he
walked
a
yard
otherwise
rather
a
fine
beast
to
look
at
with
a
huge
gray
moustache
like
a
flying
gull
and
the
most
courteous
manners
even
to
his
men
but
one
of
the
worst
bunny
one
of
the
worst
that
ever
was
it
was
said
that
the
vineyard
was
only
his
hobby
if
so
he
did
his
best
to
make
his
hobby
pay
he
used
to
come
out
from
naples
for
the
in
the
tub
when
it
was
too
rough
for
his
nerves
and
he
did
always
come
alone
his
very
name
sounded
unhealthy
corbucci
i
suppose
i
ought
to
add
that
he
was
a
count
though
counts
are
in
naples
and
in
season
all
the
year
round
he
had
a
little
english
and
liked
to
air
it
upon
me
much
to
my
disgust
if
i
could
not
hope
to
conceal
my
nationality
as
yet
i
at
least
did
not
want
to
have
it
advertised
and
the
swine
had
english
friends
when
he
heard
that
i
was
bathing
in
november
when
the
bay
is
still
as
warm
as
new
milk
he
would
shake
his
wicked
old
head
and
say
are
very
audashuss
you
are
very
audashuss
and
put
on
no
end
of
side
before
his
italians
by
god
he
had
pitched
upon
the
right
word
unawares
and
i
let
him
know
it
in
the
end
but
that
bathing
bunny
it
was
absolutely
the
best
i
ever
had
anywhere
i
said
just
now
the
water
was
like
wine
in
my
own
mind
i
used
to
call
it
blue
champagne
and
was
rather
annoyed
that
i
had
no
one
to
admire
the
phrase
otherwise
i
assure
you
that
i
missed
my
own
particular
kind
very
little
indeed
though
i
often
wished
that
you
were
there
old
chap
particularly
when
i
went
for
my
lonesome
swim
first
thing
in
the
morning
when
the
bay
was
all
and
last
thing
at
night
when
your
body
caught
phosphorescent
fire
ah
yes
it
was
a
good
enough
life
for
a
change
a
perfect
paradise
to
lie
low
in
another
eden
until
my
poor
eve
and
he
fetched
a
sigh
that
took
away
his
words
then
his
jaws
snapped
together
and
his
eyes
spoke
terribly
while
he
conquered
his
emotion
i
pen
the
last
word
advisedly
i
fancy
it
is
one
which
i
have
never
used
before
in
writing
of
raffles
for
i
can
not
at
the
moment
recall
any
other
occasion
upon
which
its
use
would
have
been
justified
on
resuming
however
he
was
not
only
calm
but
cold
and
this
flying
for
safety
to
the
other
extreme
is
the
single
instance
of
which
the
present
achates
can
record
to
the
credit
of
his
impious
aeneas
i
called
the
girl
eve
said
he
her
real
name
was
faustina
and
she
was
one
of
a
vast
family
who
hung
out
in
a
hovel
on
the
inland
border
of
the
vineyard
and
aphrodite
rising
from
the
sea
was
less
wonderful
and
not
more
beautiful
than
aphrodite
emerging
from
that
hole
it
was
the
most
exquisite
face
i
ever
saw
or
shall
see
in
this
life
absolutely
perfect
features
a
skin
that
reminded
you
of
old
gold
so
delicate
was
its
bronze
magnificent
hair
not
black
but
nearly
and
such
eyes
and
teeth
as
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
face
without
another
point
i
tell
you
bunny
london
would
go
mad
about
a
girl
like
that
but
i
do
believe
there
such
another
in
the
world
and
there
she
was
wasting
her
sweetness
upon
that
lovely
but
desolate
little
corner
of
it
well
she
did
not
waste
it
upon
me
i
would
have
married
her
and
lived
happily
ever
after
in
such
a
hovel
as
her
people
with
her
only
to
look
at
her
only
to
look
at
her
for
the
rest
of
my
days
i
could
have
lain
low
and
remained
dead
even
to
you
and
that
all
i
going
to
tell
you
about
that
bunny
cursed
be
he
who
tells
more
yet
do
run
away
with
the
idea
that
this
poor
faustina
was
the
only
woman
i
ever
cared
about
i
do
believe
in
all
that
rot
nevertheless
i
tell
you
that
she
was
the
one
being
who
ever
entirely
satisfied
my
sense
of
beauty
and
i
honestly
believe
i
could
have
chucked
the
world
and
been
true
to
faustina
for
that
alone
we
met
sometimes
in
the
little
temple
i
told
you
about
sometimes
among
the
vines
now
by
honest
accident
now
by
flagrant
design
and
found
a
rendezvous
romantic
as
one
could
wish
in
the
cave
down
all
those
subterranean
steps
then
the
sea
would
call
us
my
blue
champagne
my
sparkling
cobalt
and
there
was
the
dingy
ready
to
our
hand
oh
those
nights
i
never
knew
which
i
liked
best
the
moonlit
ones
when
you
sculled
through
silver
and
could
see
for
miles
or
the
dark
nights
when
the
fishermen
torches
stood
for
the
sea
and
a
red
in
the
sky
for
old
vesuvius
we
were
happy
i
do
mind
owning
it
we
seemed
not
to
have
a
care
between
us
my
mates
took
no
interest
in
my
affairs
and
faustina
family
did
not
appear
to
bother
about
her
the
count
was
in
naples
five
nights
of
the
seven
the
other
two
we
sighed
apart
at
first
it
was
the
oldest
story
in
literature
eden
plus
eve
the
place
had
been
a
heaven
on
earth
before
but
now
it
was
heaven
itself
so
for
a
little
then
one
night
a
monday
night
faustina
burst
out
crying
in
the
boat
and
sobbed
her
story
as
we
drifted
without
mishap
by
the
mercy
of
the
lord
and
that
was
almost
as
old
a
story
as
the
other
she
was
engaged
what
had
i
never
heard
of
it
did
i
mean
to
upset
the
boat
what
was
her
engagement
beside
our
love
niente
crooned
faustina
sighing
yet
smiling
through
her
tears
no
but
what
did
matter
was
that
the
man
had
threatened
to
stab
her
to
the
heart
and
would
do
it
as
soon
as
look
at
her
that
i
knew
i
knew
it
merely
from
my
knowledge
of
the
neapolitans
for
i
had
no
idea
who
the
man
might
be
i
knew
it
and
yet
i
took
this
detail
better
than
the
fact
of
the
engagement
though
now
i
began
to
laugh
at
both
as
if
i
was
going
to
let
her
marry
anybody
else
as
if
a
hair
of
her
lovely
head
should
be
touched
while
i
lived
to
protect
her
i
had
a
great
mind
to
row
away
to
blazes
with
her
that
very
night
and
never
go
near
the
vineyard
again
or
let
her
either
but
we
had
not
a
lira
between
us
at
the
time
and
only
the
rags
in
which
we
sat
barefoot
in
the
boat
besides
i
had
to
know
the
name
of
the
animal
who
had
threatened
a
woman
and
such
a
woman
as
this
for
a
long
time
she
refused
to
tell
me
with
splendid
obduracy
but
i
was
as
determined
as
she
so
at
last
she
made
conditions
i
was
not
to
go
and
get
put
in
prison
for
sticking
a
knife
into
him
he
was
worth
it
and
i
did
promise
not
to
stab
him
in
the
back
faustina
seemed
quite
satisfied
though
a
little
puzzled
by
my
manner
having
herself
the
racial
tolerance
for
cold
steel
and
next
moment
she
had
taken
away
my
breath
is
stefano
she
whispered
and
hung
her
head
and
well
she
might
poor
thing
stefano
of
all
creatures
on
earth
for
her
bunny
he
was
a
miserable
little
undersized
wretch
servile
surly
and
second
only
to
his
master
in
bestial
cunning
and
hypocrisy
his
face
was
enough
for
me
that
was
what
i
read
in
it
and
i
do
often
make
mistakes
he
was
own
confidential
and
that
alone
was
enough
to
damn
him
in
decent
eyes
always
came
out
first
on
the
saturday
with
the
spese
to
have
all
ready
for
his
master
and
current
mistress
and
stayed
behind
on
the
monday
to
clear
and
lock
up
stefano
that
worm
i
could
well
understand
his
threatening
a
woman
with
a
knife
what
beat
me
was
how
any
woman
could
ever
have
listened
to
him
above
all
that
faustina
should
be
the
one
it
passed
my
comprehension
but
i
questioned
her
as
gently
as
i
could
and
her
explanation
was
largely
the
one
you
would
expect
her
parents
were
so
poor
they
were
so
many
in
family
some
of
them
begged
would
i
promise
never
to
tell
then
some
of
them
stole
sometimes
and
all
knew
the
pains
of
actual
want
she
looked
after
the
cows
but
there
were
only
two
of
them
and
brought
the
milk
to
the
vineyard
and
elsewhere
but
that
was
not
employment
for
more
than
one
and
there
were
countless
sisters
waiting
to
take
her
place
then
he
was
so
rich
stefano
i
echoed
arturo
mio
yes
i
played
the
game
on
that
vineyard
bunny
even
to
going
my
own
first
name
how
comes
he
to
be
rich
i
asked
suspiciously
she
did
not
know
but
he
had
given
her
such
beautiful
jewels
the
family
had
lived
on
them
for
months
she
pretending
an
avocat
had
taken
charge
of
them
for
her
against
her
marriage
but
i
cared
nothing
about
all
that
stefano
i
could
only
mutter
the
count
has
paid
for
some
of
them
he
is
very
kind
you
is
he
yes
very
kind
you
would
live
in
his
house
afterwards
now
mia
cara
not
now
by
god
you
do
said
i
in
english
you
would
have
done
so
eh
course
that
was
arranged
the
count
is
really
very
kind
you
see
anything
of
him
when
he
comes
here
yes
he
had
sometimes
brought
her
little
presents
sweetmeats
ribbons
and
the
like
but
the
offering
had
always
been
made
through
this
toad
of
a
stefano
knowing
the
men
i
now
knew
all
but
faustina
she
had
the
pure
and
simple
heart
and
the
white
soul
by
the
god
who
made
it
and
for
all
her
kindness
to
a
tattered
scapegrace
who
made
love
to
her
in
broken
italian
between
the
ripples
and
the
stars
she
was
not
to
know
what
i
was
remember
and
beside
corbucci
and
his
henchman
i
was
the
archangel
gabriel
come
down
to
earth
well
as
i
lay
awake
that
night
two
more
lines
of
swinburne
came
into
my
head
and
came
to
stay
god
said
him
who
wins
her
take
and
keep
faustine
on
that
couplet
i
slept
at
last
and
it
was
my
text
and
watchword
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
i
forget
how
well
you
know
your
swinburne
bunny
but
do
you
run
away
with
the
idea
that
there
was
anything
else
in
common
between
his
faustine
and
mine
for
the
last
time
let
me
tell
you
that
poor
faustina
was
the
whitest
and
the
best
i
ever
knew
well
i
was
strung
up
for
trouble
when
the
next
saturday
came
and
i
tell
you
what
i
had
done
i
had
broken
the
pledge
and
burgled
corbucci
villa
in
my
best
manner
during
his
absence
in
naples
not
that
it
gave
me
the
slightest
trouble
but
no
human
being
could
have
told
that
i
had
been
in
when
i
came
out
and
i
had
stolen
nothing
mark
you
but
only
borrowed
a
revolver
from
a
drawer
in
the
desk
with
one
or
two
trifling
accessories
for
by
this
time
i
had
the
measure
of
these
damned
neapolitans
they
are
spry
enough
with
a
knife
but
you
show
them
the
business
end
of
a
and
they
streak
like
rabbits
for
the
nearest
hole
but
the
revolver
was
for
my
own
use
it
was
for
faustina
and
i
taught
her
how
to
use
it
in
the
cave
down
there
by
the
sea
shooting
at
candles
stuck
upon
the
rock
the
noise
in
the
cave
was
something
frightful
but
high
up
above
it
could
be
heard
at
all
as
we
proved
to
each
satisfaction
pretty
early
in
the
proceedings
so
now
faustina
was
armed
with
munitions
of
and
i
knew
enough
of
her
character
to
entertain
no
doubt
as
to
their
spirited
use
upon
occasion
between
the
two
of
us
in
fact
our
friend
stefano
seemed
tolerably
certain
of
a
warm
but
the
saturday
brought
word
that
the
count
was
not
coming
this
week
being
in
rome
on
business
and
unable
to
return
in
time
so
for
a
whole
sunday
we
were
promised
peace
and
made
bold
plans
accordingly
there
was
no
further
merit
in
hushing
this
thing
up
him
who
wins
her
take
and
keep
faustine
yes
but
let
him
win
her
openly
or
lose
her
and
be
damned
to
him
so
on
the
sunday
i
was
going
to
have
it
out
with
her
people
with
the
count
and
stefano
as
soon
as
they
showed
their
noses
i
had
no
inducement
remember
ever
to
return
to
surreptitious
life
within
a
of
wormwood
scrubbs
faustina
and
the
bay
of
naples
were
quite
good
enough
for
me
and
the
prehistoric
man
in
me
rather
exulted
in
the
idea
of
fighting
for
my
desire
on
the
saturday
however
we
were
able
to
meet
for
the
last
time
as
heretofore
just
once
more
in
secret
down
there
in
the
cave
as
soon
as
might
be
after
dark
neither
of
us
minded
if
we
were
kept
for
hours
each
knew
in
the
end
that
the
other
would
come
and
there
was
a
charm
of
its
own
even
in
waiting
with
such
knowledge
but
that
night
i
did
lose
patience
not
in
the
cave
but
up
above
where
first
on
one
pretext
and
then
on
another
the
direttore
kept
me
going
until
i
smelt
a
rat
he
was
not
given
to
exacting
overtime
this
direttore
whose
only
fault
was
his
servile
subjection
to
our
common
boss
it
seemed
pretty
obvious
therefore
that
he
was
acting
upon
some
secret
instructions
from
corbucci
himself
and
the
moment
i
suspected
this
i
asked
him
to
his
face
if
it
was
not
the
case
and
it
was
he
admitted
it
with
many
shrugs
being
a
conveniently
weak
person
whom
one
felt
almost
ashamed
of
bullying
as
the
occasion
demanded
the
fact
was
however
that
the
count
had
sent
for
him
on
finding
he
had
to
go
to
rome
and
had
said
he
was
very
sorry
to
go
just
then
as
among
other
things
he
intended
to
speak
to
me
about
faustina
stefano
had
told
him
all
about
his
row
with
her
and
moreover
that
it
was
on
my
account
which
faustina
had
never
told
me
though
i
had
guessed
as
much
for
myself
well
the
count
was
going
to
take
his
jackal
part
for
all
he
was
worth
which
was
just
exactly
what
i
had
expected
him
to
do
he
intended
going
for
me
on
his
return
but
meanwhile
i
was
not
to
make
hay
in
his
absence
and
so
this
tool
of
a
direttore
had
orders
to
keep
me
at
it
night
and
day
i
undertook
not
to
give
the
poor
beast
away
but
at
the
same
time
told
him
i
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
doing
another
stroke
of
work
that
night
it
was
very
dark
and
i
remember
knocking
my
head
against
the
oranges
as
i
ran
up
the
long
shallow
steps
which
ended
the
journey
between
the
direttore
lodge
and
the
villa
itself
but
at
the
back
of
the
villa
was
the
garden
i
spoke
about
and
also
a
bare
chunk
of
the
cliff
where
it
was
bored
by
that
subterranean
stair
so
i
saw
the
stars
close
overhead
and
the
fishermen
torches
far
below
the
coastwise
lights
and
the
crimson
hieroglyph
that
spelt
vesuvius
before
i
plunged
into
the
darkness
of
the
shaft
and
that
was
the
last
time
i
appreciated
the
unique
and
peaceful
charm
of
this
outlandish
spot
the
stair
was
in
two
long
flights
with
an
or
two
at
the
top
of
the
upper
one
but
not
another
till
you
came
to
the
iron
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
lower
as
you
may
read
of
an
infinitely
lighter
place
in
a
finer
work
of
fiction
than
you
are
ever
likely
to
write
bunny
it
was
at
noon
dark
as
midnight
at
dusk
and
black
as
the
ninth
plague
of
egypt
at
midnight
i
wo
swear
to
my
quotation
but
i
will
to
those
stairs
they
were
as
black
that
night
as
the
inside
of
the
safest
safe
in
the
strongest
in
the
chancery
lane
deposit
yet
i
had
not
got
far
down
them
with
my
bare
feet
before
i
heard
somebody
else
coming
up
in
boots
you
may
imagine
what
a
turn
that
gave
me
it
could
not
be
faustina
who
went
barefoot
three
seasons
of
the
four
and
yet
there
was
faustina
waiting
for
me
down
below
what
a
fright
she
must
have
had
and
all
at
once
my
own
blood
ran
cold
for
the
man
sang
like
a
kettle
as
he
plodded
up
and
up
it
was
it
must
be
the
count
himself
whom
we
all
supposed
to
be
in
rome
higher
he
came
and
nearer
nearer
slowly
yet
hurriedly
now
stopping
to
cough
and
gasp
now
taking
a
few
steps
by
elephantine
assault
i
should
have
enjoyed
the
situation
if
it
had
not
been
for
poor
faustina
in
the
cave
as
it
was
i
was
filled
with
nameless
fears
but
i
could
not
resist
giving
that
grampus
corbucci
one
bad
moment
on
account
a
crazy
ran
up
one
wall
so
i
carefully
flattened
myself
against
the
other
and
he
passed
within
six
inches
of
me
puffing
and
wheezing
like
a
brass
band
i
let
him
go
a
few
steps
higher
and
then
i
let
him
have
it
with
both
lungs
buona
sera
eccellenza
signori
i
roared
after
him
and
a
scream
came
down
in
answer
such
a
scream
a
dozen
different
terrors
were
in
it
and
the
wheezing
had
stopped
with
the
old
scoundrel
heart
sta
la
he
squeaked
at
last
gibbering
and
whimpering
like
a
whipped
monkey
so
that
i
could
not
bear
to
miss
his
face
and
got
a
match
all
ready
to
strike
signori
he
did
repeat
my
name
nor
did
he
damn
me
in
heaps
he
did
nothing
but
wheeze
for
a
good
minute
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
insinuating
civility
in
his
best
english
nearer
arturo
you
are
in
the
lower
regions
down
there
i
want
to
speak
with
you
thanks
i
in
a
hurry
i
said
and
dropped
that
match
back
into
my
pocket
he
might
be
armed
and
i
was
not
you
are
in
a
and
he
wheezed
amusement
you
thought
i
was
still
in
rome
no
doubt
and
so
i
was
until
this
afternoon
when
i
caught
train
at
the
eleventh
moment
and
then
another
train
from
naples
to
pozzuoli
i
have
been
rowed
here
now
by
a
fisherman
of
pozzuoli
i
had
not
time
to
stop
anywhere
in
naples
but
only
to
drive
from
station
to
station
so
i
am
without
stefano
arturo
i
am
without
stefano
his
sly
voice
sounded
preternaturally
sly
in
the
absolute
darkness
but
even
through
that
impenetrable
veil
i
knew
it
for
a
sham
i
had
laid
hold
of
the
it
shook
violently
in
my
hand
he
also
was
holding
it
where
he
stood
and
these
suppressed
tremors
or
rather
their
detection
in
this
way
struck
a
strange
chill
to
my
heart
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
pluck
it
up
is
lucky
for
stefano
said
i
grim
as
death
but
you
must
not
be
too
on
remonstrated
the
count
have
stole
his
girl
he
speak
with
me
about
it
and
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
it
is
very
audashuss
arturo
very
audashuss
perhaps
you
are
even
going
to
meet
her
now
eh
i
told
him
straight
that
i
was
there
is
no
for
she
is
not
there
did
see
her
in
the
cave
i
cried
too
delighted
at
the
thought
to
keep
it
to
myself
had
no
such
fortune
the
old
devil
said
is
there
all
the
same
only
wish
i
known
i
kept
her
long
enough
in
fact
i
threw
this
over
my
shoulder
as
i
turned
and
went
running
down
you
will
find
her
his
malicious
voice
came
croaking
after
me
you
will
i
so
and
find
her
i
did
raffles
had
been
on
his
feet
some
time
unable
to
sit
still
or
to
stand
moving
excitedly
about
the
room
but
now
he
stood
still
enough
his
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
his
head
between
his
hands
dead
i
whispered
and
he
nodded
to
the
wall
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
cave
there
was
no
answer
to
my
voice
then
i
went
in
and
my
foot
touched
hers
and
it
was
colder
than
the
rock
bunny
they
had
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
she
had
fought
them
and
they
had
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
you
say
i
said
gently
as
he
stood
in
heavy
silence
his
back
still
turned
i
thought
stefano
had
been
left
behind
raffles
was
round
in
a
flash
his
face
his
eyes
dancing
death
he
was
in
the
cave
he
shouted
i
saw
him
i
spotted
him
it
was
broad
twilight
after
those
stairs
and
i
went
for
him
with
my
bare
hands
not
fists
bunny
not
fists
for
a
thing
like
that
i
meant
getting
my
fingers
into
his
vile
little
heart
and
tearing
it
out
by
the
roots
i
was
stark
mad
but
he
had
the
revolver
hers
he
blazed
it
at
arm
length
and
missed
and
that
steadied
me
i
had
smashed
his
against
the
rock
before
he
could
blaze
again
the
revolver
fell
with
a
rattle
but
without
going
off
in
an
instant
i
had
it
tight
and
the
little
swine
at
my
mercy
at
last
you
did
show
him
any
mercy
with
faustina
dead
at
my
feet
i
should
have
deserved
none
in
the
next
world
if
i
had
shown
him
any
in
this
no
i
just
stood
over
him
with
the
revolver
in
both
hands
feeling
the
chambers
with
my
thumb
and
as
i
stood
he
stabbed
at
me
but
i
stepped
back
to
that
one
and
brought
him
down
with
a
bullet
in
his
guts
i
can
spare
you
two
or
three
more
i
said
for
my
poor
girl
could
not
have
fired
a
shot
that
one
to
hell
with
you
and
that
and
that
then
i
started
coughing
and
wheezing
like
the
count
himself
for
the
place
was
full
of
smoke
when
it
cleared
my
man
was
very
dead
and
i
tipped
him
into
the
sea
to
defile
that
rather
than
faustina
cave
and
then
and
then
we
were
alone
for
the
last
time
she
and
i
in
our
own
pet
haunt
and
i
could
scarcely
see
her
yet
i
would
not
strike
a
match
for
i
knew
she
would
not
have
me
see
her
as
she
was
i
could
say
to
her
without
that
i
said
it
and
i
left
her
like
a
man
and
up
the
first
steps
with
my
head
in
the
air
and
the
stars
all
sharp
in
the
sky
then
suddenly
they
swam
and
back
i
went
like
a
lunatic
to
see
if
she
was
really
dead
to
bring
her
back
to
life
bunny
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
not
of
the
count
i
murmured
at
last
not
even
of
the
count
said
raffles
turning
round
with
a
sigh
i
left
him
pretty
sorry
for
himself
but
what
was
the
good
of
that
i
had
taken
blood
for
blood
and
it
was
not
corbucci
who
had
killed
faustina
no
the
plan
was
his
but
that
was
not
part
of
the
plan
they
had
found
out
about
our
meetings
in
the
cave
nothing
simpler
than
to
have
me
kept
hard
at
it
overhead
and
to
carry
off
faustina
by
brute
force
in
the
boat
it
was
their
only
chance
for
she
had
said
more
to
stefano
than
she
had
admitted
to
me
and
more
than
i
am
going
to
repeat
about
myself
no
persuasion
would
have
induced
her
to
listen
to
him
again
so
they
tried
force
and
she
drew
corbucci
revolver
on
them
but
they
had
taken
her
by
surprise
and
stefano
stabbed
her
before
she
could
fire
but
how
do
you
know
all
that
i
asked
raffles
for
his
tale
was
going
to
pieces
in
the
telling
and
the
tragic
end
of
poor
faustina
was
no
ending
for
me
oh
said
he
i
had
it
from
corbucci
at
his
own
revolver
point
he
was
waiting
at
his
window
and
i
could
have
potted
him
at
my
ease
where
he
stood
against
the
light
listening
hard
enough
but
not
seeing
a
thing
so
he
asked
whether
it
was
stefano
and
i
whispered
signore
and
then
whether
he
had
finished
arturo
and
i
brought
the
same
shot
off
again
he
had
let
me
in
before
he
knew
who
was
finished
and
who
was
not
and
did
you
finish
him
no
that
was
too
good
for
corbucci
but
i
bound
and
gagged
him
about
as
tight
as
man
was
ever
gagged
or
bound
and
i
left
him
in
his
room
with
the
shutters
shut
and
the
house
locked
up
the
shutters
of
that
old
place
were
six
inches
thick
and
the
walls
nearly
six
feet
that
was
on
the
saturday
night
and
the
count
was
expected
at
the
vineyard
before
the
following
saturday
meanwhile
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
rome
but
the
dead
would
doubtless
be
discovered
next
day
and
i
am
afraid
this
would
lead
to
his
own
discovery
with
the
life
still
in
him
i
believe
he
figured
on
that
himself
for
he
sat
threatening
me
gamely
till
the
last
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
as
he
was
with
his
head
split
in
two
by
a
ruler
tied
at
the
back
of
it
and
his
great
moustache
pushed
up
into
his
bulging
eyes
but
i
locked
him
up
in
the
dark
without
a
qualm
and
i
wished
and
still
wish
him
every
torment
of
the
damned
and
then
the
night
was
still
young
and
within
ten
miles
there
was
the
best
of
ports
in
a
storm
and
hundreds
of
holds
for
the
humble
stowaway
to
choose
from
but
i
did
want
to
go
further
than
genoa
for
by
this
time
my
italian
would
wash
so
i
chose
the
old
norddeutscher
lloyd
and
had
an
excellent
voyage
in
one
of
the
boats
slung
over
the
bridge
that
better
than
any
hold
bunny
and
i
did
splendidly
on
oranges
brought
from
the
vineyard
and
at
genoa
at
genoa
i
took
to
my
wits
once
more
and
have
been
living
on
nothing
else
ever
since
but
there
i
had
to
begin
all
over
again
and
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
ladder
i
slept
in
the
streets
i
begged
i
did
all
manner
of
terrible
things
rather
hoping
for
a
bad
end
but
never
coming
to
one
then
one
day
i
saw
a
old
chap
looking
at
me
through
a
a
window
i
had
designs
upon
and
when
i
stared
at
him
he
stared
at
me
and
we
wore
the
same
rags
so
i
had
come
to
that
but
one
reflection
makes
many
i
had
not
recognized
myself
who
on
earth
would
recognize
me
london
called
me
and
here
i
am
italy
had
broken
my
heart
and
there
it
stays
flippant
as
a
schoolboy
one
moment
playful
even
in
the
bitterness
of
the
next
and
now
no
longer
giving
way
to
the
feeling
which
had
spoilt
the
climax
of
his
tale
raffles
needed
knowing
as
i
alone
knew
him
for
a
right
appreciation
of
those
last
words
that
they
were
no
mere
words
i
know
full
well
that
but
for
the
tragedy
of
his
italian
life
that
life
would
have
sufficed
him
for
years
if
not
for
ever
i
did
and
do
still
believe
but
i
alone
see
him
as
i
saw
him
then
the
lines
upon
his
face
and
the
pain
behind
the
lines
how
they
came
to
disappear
and
what
removed
them
you
will
never
guess
it
was
the
one
thing
you
would
have
expected
to
have
the
opposite
effect
the
thing
indeed
that
had
forced
his
confidence
the
organ
and
the
voice
once
more
beneath
our
very
windows
margarita

i
simply
stared
at
raffles
instead
of
deepening
his
lines
had
vanished
he
looked
years
younger
mischievous
and
merry
and
alert
as
i
remembered
him
of
old
in
the
breathless
crisis
of
some
madcap
escapade
he
was
holding
up
his
finger
he
was
stealing
to
the
window
he
was
peeping
through
the
blind
as
though
our
side
street
were
scotland
yard
itself
he
was
stealing
back
again
all
revelry
excitement
and
suspense
i
half
thought
they
were
after
me
before
said
he
that
was
why
i
made
you
look
i
dare
take
a
proper
look
myself
but
what
a
jest
if
they
were
what
a
jest
do
you
mean
the
police
said
i
the
police
bunny
do
you
know
them
and
me
so
little
that
you
can
look
me
in
the
face
and
ask
such
a
question
my
boy
i
dead
to
them
off
their
books
a
good
deal
deader
than
being
off
the
hooks
why
if
i
went
to
scotland
yard
this
minute
to
give
myself
up
chuck
me
out
for
a
harmless
lunatic
no
i
fear
an
enemy
nowadays
and
i
go
in
terror
of
the
sometime
friend
but
i
have
the
utmost
confidence
in
the
dear
police
then
whom
do
you
mean
the
camorra
i
repeated
the
word
with
a
different
intonation
not
that
i
had
never
heard
of
that
most
powerful
and
sinister
of
secret
societies
but
i
failed
to
see
on
what
grounds
raffles
should
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
these
everyday
belonged
to
it
it
was
one
of
corbucci
threats
said
he
if
i
killed
him
the
camorra
would
certainly
kill
me
he
kept
on
telling
me
so
it
was
like
his
cunning
not
to
say
that
he
would
put
them
on
my
tracks
whether
or
no
he
is
probably
a
member
himself
obviously
from
what
he
said
but
why
on
earth
should
you
think
that
these
fellows
are
i
demanded
as
that
brazen
voice
came
rasping
through
a
second
verse
i
do
think
it
was
only
an
idea
that
thing
is
so
thoroughly
neapolitan
and
i
never
heard
it
on
a
london
organ
before
then
again
what
should
bring
them
back
here
i
peeped
through
the
blind
in
my
turn
and
to
be
sure
there
was
the
fellow
with
the
blue
chin
and
the
white
teeth
watching
our
windows
and
ours
only
as
he
bawled
and
why
cried
raffles
his
eyes
dancing
when
i
told
him
why
should
they
come
sneaking
back
to
us
does
that
look
suspicious
bunny
does
that
promise
a
lark
not
to
me
i
said
having
the
smile
for
once
how
many
people
should
you
imagine
toss
them
five
shilling
for
as
many
minutes
of
their
infernal
row
you
seem
to
forget
that
what
you
did
an
hour
ago
raffles
had
forgotten
his
blank
face
confessed
the
fact
then
suddenly
he
burst
outlaughing
at
himself
bunny
said
he
you
no
imagination
and
i
never
knew
i
had
so
much
of
course
you
right
i
only
wish
you
were
not
for
nothing
i
should
enjoy
more
than
taking
on
another
neapolitan
or
two
you
see
i
owe
them
something
still
i
did
settle
in
full
i
owe
them
more
than
ever
i
shall
pay
them
on
this
side
styx
he
had
hardened
even
as
he
spoke
the
lines
and
the
years
had
come
again
and
his
eyes
were
flint
and
steel
with
an
honest
grief
behind
the
glitter
the
last
laugh
as
i
have
had
occasion
to
remark
elsewhere
the
pick
of
our
exploits
from
a
frankly
criminal
point
of
view
are
of
least
use
for
the
comparatively
pure
purposes
of
these
papers
they
might
be
appreciated
in
a
trade
journal
if
only
that
want
could
be
supplied
by
skilled
manipulators
of
the
jemmy
and
the
large
light
bunch
but
as
records
of
unbroken
yet
insignificant
success
they
would
be
found
at
once
too
trivial
and
too
technical
if
not
sordid
and
unprofitable
into
the
bargain
the
latter
epithets
and
worse
have
indeed
already
been
applied
if
not
to
raffles
and
all
his
works
at
least
to
mine
upon
raffles
by
more
than
one
worthy
wielder
of
a
virtuous
pen
i
need
not
say
how
heartily
i
disagree
with
that
truly
pious
opinion
so
far
from
admitting
a
single
word
of
it
i
maintain
it
is
the
liveliest
warning
that
i
am
giving
to
the
world
raffles
was
a
genius
and
he
could
not
make
it
pay
raffles
had
invention
resource
incomparable
audacity
and
a
nerve
in
ten
thousand
he
was
both
strategian
and
tactician
and
we
all
now
know
the
difference
between
the
two
yet
for
months
he
had
been
hiding
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
unable
to
show
even
his
altered
face
by
night
or
day
without
risk
unless
another
risk
were
courted
by
three
inches
of
conspicuous
crepe
then
thus
far
our
rewards
had
oftener
than
not
been
no
reward
at
all
altogether
it
was
a
very
different
story
from
the
old
festive
unsuspected
club
and
cricket
days
with
their
noctes
ambrosianae
at
the
albany
and
now
in
addition
to
the
eternal
peril
of
recognition
there
was
yet
another
menace
of
which
i
knew
nothing
i
thought
no
more
of
our
neapolitan
though
i
did
often
think
of
the
moving
page
that
they
had
torn
for
me
out
of
my
friend
strange
life
in
italy
raffles
never
alluded
to
the
subject
again
and
for
my
part
i
had
entirely
forgotten
his
wild
ideas
connecting
the
with
the
camorra
and
imagining
them
upon
his
own
tracks
i
heard
no
more
of
it
and
thought
as
little
as
i
say
then
one
night
in
the
autumn
i
shrink
from
shocking
the
susceptible
for
nothing
but
there
was
a
certain
house
in
palace
gardens
and
when
we
got
there
raffles
would
pass
on
i
could
see
no
soul
in
sight
no
glimmer
in
the
windows
but
raffles
had
my
arm
and
on
we
went
without
talking
about
it
sharp
to
the
left
on
the
notting
hill
side
sharper
still
up
silver
street
a
little
tacking
west
and
south
a
plunge
across
high
street
and
presently
we
were
home
pyjamas
first
said
raffles
with
as
much
authority
as
though
it
mattered
it
was
a
warm
night
however
though
september
and
i
did
not
mind
until
i
came
in
clad
as
he
commanded
to
find
the
autocrat
himself
still
booted
and
capped
he
was
peeping
through
the
blind
and
the
gas
was
still
turned
down
but
he
said
that
i
could
turn
it
up
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
and
nothing
with
it
may
i
mix
you
one
said
i
no
thanks
what
the
trouble
we
were
followed
never
you
never
saw
it
but
you
never
looked
round
i
have
an
eye
at
the
back
of
each
ear
bunny
i
helped
myself
and
i
fear
with
less
moderation
than
might
have
been
the
case
a
minute
before
so
that
was
why
that
was
why
said
raffles
nodding
but
he
did
not
smile
and
i
put
down
my
glass
untouched
they
were
following
us
then
all
up
palace
gardens
i
thought
you
wound
about
coming
back
over
the
hill
nevertheless
one
of
them
in
the
street
below
at
this
moment
no
he
was
not
fooling
me
he
was
very
grim
and
he
had
not
taken
off
a
thing
perhaps
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
plain
clothes
i
sighed
following
the
sartorial
train
of
thought
even
to
the
loathly
arrows
that
had
decorated
my
person
once
already
for
a
little
aeon
next
time
they
would
give
me
double
the
skilly
was
in
my
stomach
when
i
saw
raffles
face
who
said
it
was
the
police
bunny
said
he
it
the
italians
they
only
after
me
they
wo
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
let
alone
cropping
it
have
a
drink
and
do
mind
me
i
shall
score
them
off
before
i
done
and
i
help
you
no
old
chap
you
wo
this
is
my
own
little
show
i
known
about
it
for
weeks
i
first
tumbled
to
it
the
day
those
neapolitans
came
back
with
their
organs
though
i
did
seriously
suspect
things
then
they
never
came
again
those
two
they
had
done
their
part
that
the
camorra
all
over
from
all
accounts
the
count
i
told
you
about
is
pretty
high
up
in
it
by
the
way
he
spoke
but
there
will
be
grades
and
grades
between
him
and
the
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
had
every
neapolitan
in
the
town
upon
my
tracks
the
organization
incredible
then
do
you
remember
the
superior
foreigner
who
came
to
the
door
a
few
days
afterwards
you
said
he
had
velvet
eyes
i
never
connected
him
with
those
two
of
course
you
did
bunny
so
you
threatened
to
kick
the
fellow
downstairs
and
only
made
them
keener
on
the
scent
it
was
too
late
to
say
anything
when
you
told
me
but
the
very
next
time
i
showed
my
nose
outside
i
heard
a
camera
click
as
i
passed
and
the
fiend
was
a
person
with
velvet
eyes
then
there
was
a
lull
that
happened
weeks
ago
they
had
sent
me
to
italy
for
identification
by
count
corbucci
but
this
is
all
theory
i
exclaimed
how
on
earth
can
you
know
i
do
know
said
raffles
but
i
should
like
to
bet
our
friend
the
bloodhound
is
hanging
about
the
corner
near
the
look
through
my
window
it
dark
in
there
and
tell
me
who
he
is
the
man
was
too
far
away
for
me
to
swear
to
his
face
but
he
wore
a
of
length
and
the
lamp
across
the
road
played
steadily
on
his
boots
they
were
very
yellow
and
they
made
no
noise
when
he
took
a
turn
i
strained
my
eyes
and
all
at
once
i
remembered
the
splay
yellow
boots
of
the
insidious
foreigner
with
the
soft
eyes
and
the
face
whom
i
had
turned
from
the
door
as
a
palpable
fraud
the
ring
at
the
bell
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
him
there
had
been
no
warning
step
upon
the
stairs
and
my
suspicious
eye
had
searched
his
feet
for
rubber
soles
it
the
fellow
i
said
returning
to
raffles
and
i
described
his
boots
raffles
was
delighted
well
done
bunny
you
coming
on
said
he
now
i
wonder
if
been
over
here
all
the
time
or
if
they
sent
him
over
expressly
you
did
better
than
you
think
in
spotting
those
boots
for
they
can
only
have
been
made
in
italy
and
that
looks
like
the
special
envoy
but
it
no
use
speculating
i
must
find
out
how
can
you
he
wo
stay
there
all
night
well
when
he
gets
tired
of
it
i
shall
return
the
compliment
and
follow
him
not
alone
said
i
firmly
well
we
see
we
see
at
once
said
raffles
rising
out
with
the
gas
bunny
while
i
take
a
look
thank
you
now
wait
a
bit
yes
he
chucked
it
he
off
already
and
so
am
i
but
i
slipped
to
our
outer
door
and
held
the
passage
i
do
let
you
go
alone
you
know
you
ca
come
with
me
in
pyjamas
now
i
see
why
you
made
me
put
them
on
bunny
if
you
do
shift
i
shall
have
to
shift
you
this
is
my
very
own
private
show
but
i
be
back
in
an
hour
there
you
swear
by
all
my
gods
i
gave
in
how
could
i
help
giving
in
he
did
not
look
the
man
that
he
had
been
but
you
never
knew
with
raffles
and
i
could
not
have
him
lay
a
hand
on
me
i
let
him
go
with
a
shrug
and
my
blessing
then
ran
into
his
room
to
see
the
last
of
him
from
the
window
the
creature
in
the
coat
and
boots
had
reached
the
end
of
our
little
street
where
he
appeared
to
have
hesitated
so
that
raffles
was
just
in
time
to
see
which
way
he
turned
and
raffles
was
after
him
at
an
easy
pace
and
had
himself
almost
reached
the
corner
when
my
attention
was
distracted
from
the
alert
nonchalance
of
his
gait
i
was
marvelling
that
it
alone
had
not
long
ago
betrayed
him
for
nothing
about
him
was
so
unconsciously
characteristic
when
suddenly
i
realized
that
raffles
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
little
lonely
street
another
pedestrian
had
entered
from
the
other
end
a
man
heavily
built
and
clad
with
an
astrakhan
collar
to
his
coat
on
this
warm
night
and
a
black
slouch
hat
that
hid
his
features
from
my
view
his
steps
were
the
short
and
shuffling
ones
of
a
man
advanced
in
years
and
in
fatty
degeneration
but
of
a
sudden
they
stopped
beneath
my
very
eyes
i
could
have
dropped
a
marble
into
the
dinted
crown
of
the
black
felt
hat
then
at
the
same
moment
raffles
turned
the
corner
without
looking
round
and
the
big
man
below
raised
both
his
hands
and
his
face
of
the
latter
i
saw
only
the
huge
white
moustache
like
a
flying
gull
as
raffles
had
described
it
for
at
a
glance
i
divined
that
this
was
his
the
count
corbucci
himself
i
did
not
stop
to
consider
the
subtleties
of
the
system
by
which
the
real
hunter
lagged
behind
while
his
subordinate
pointed
the
quarry
like
a
sporting
dog
i
left
the
count
shuffling
onward
faster
than
before
and
i
jumped
into
some
clothes
as
though
the
flats
were
on
fire
if
the
count
was
going
to
follow
raffles
in
his
turn
then
i
would
follow
the
count
in
mine
and
there
would
be
a
midnight
procession
of
us
through
the
town
but
i
found
no
sign
of
him
in
the
empty
street
and
no
sign
in
the
earl
court
road
that
looked
as
empty
for
all
its
length
save
for
a
natural
enemy
standing
like
a
waxwork
figure
with
a
glimmer
at
his
belt
officer
i
gasped
have
you
seen
anything
of
an
old
gentleman
with
a
big
white
mustache
the
unlicked
cub
of
a
common
constable
seemed
to
eye
me
the
more
suspiciously
for
the
flattering
form
of
my
address
took
a
hansom
said
he
at
length
a
hansom
then
he
was
not
following
the
others
on
foot
there
was
no
guessing
his
game
but
something
must
be
said
or
done
he
a
friend
of
mine
i
explained
and
i
want
to
overtake
him
did
you
hear
where
he
told
the
fellow
to
drive
a
curt
negative
was
the
policeman
reply
to
that
and
if
ever
i
take
part
in
a
night
revolver
versus
baton
in
the
back
kitchen
i
know
which
member
of
the
metropolitan
police
force
i
should
like
for
my
opponent
if
there
was
no
overtaking
the
count
however
it
should
be
a
comparatively
simple
matter
in
the
case
of
the
couple
on
foot
and
i
wildly
hailed
the
first
hansom
that
crawled
into
my
ken
i
must
tell
raffles
who
it
was
that
i
had
seen
the
earl
court
road
was
long
and
the
time
since
he
vanished
in
it
but
a
few
short
minutes
i
drove
down
the
length
of
that
useful
thoroughfare
with
an
eye
apiece
on
either
pavement
sweeping
each
as
with
a
brush
but
never
a
raffles
came
into
the
pan
then
i
tried
the
fulham
road
first
to
the
west
then
to
the
east
and
in
the
end
drove
home
to
the
flat
as
bold
as
brass
i
did
not
realize
my
indiscretion
until
i
had
paid
the
man
and
was
on
the
stairs
raffles
never
dreamt
of
driving
all
the
way
back
but
i
was
hoping
now
to
find
him
waiting
up
above
he
had
said
an
hour
i
had
remembered
it
suddenly
and
now
the
hour
was
more
than
up
but
the
flat
was
as
empty
as
i
had
left
it
the
very
light
that
had
encouraged
me
pale
though
it
was
as
i
turned
the
corner
in
my
hansom
was
but
the
light
that
i
myself
had
left
burning
in
the
desolate
passage
i
can
give
you
no
conception
of
the
night
that
i
spent
most
of
it
i
hung
across
the
sill
throwing
a
wide
net
with
my
ears
catching
every
footstep
afar
off
every
hansom
bell
farther
still
only
to
gather
in
some
alien
whom
i
seldom
even
landed
in
our
street
then
i
would
listen
at
the
door
he
might
come
over
the
roof
and
eventually
some
one
did
but
now
it
was
broad
daylight
and
i
flung
the
door
open
in
the
milkman
face
which
whitened
at
the
shock
as
though
i
had
ducked
him
in
his
own
pail
you
late
i
thundered
as
the
first
excuse
for
my
excitement
beg
your
pardon
said
he
indignantly
but
i
half
an
hour
before
my
usual
time
then
i
beg
yours
said
i
but
the
fact
is
maturin
has
had
one
of
his
bad
nights
and
i
seem
to
have
been
waiting
hours
for
milk
to
make
him
a
cup
of
tea
this
little
fib
ready
enough
for
raffles
though
i
say
it
earned
me
not
only
forgiveness
but
that
obliging
sympathy
which
is
a
branch
of
the
business
of
the
man
at
the
door
the
good
fellow
said
that
he
could
see
i
had
been
sitting
up
all
night
and
he
left
me
pluming
myself
upon
the
accidental
art
with
which
i
had
told
my
very
necessary
on
reflection
i
gave
the
credit
to
instinct
not
accident
and
then
sighed
afresh
as
i
realized
how
the
influence
of
the
master
was
sinking
into
me
and
he
heaven
knew
where
but
my
punishment
was
swift
to
follow
for
within
the
hour
the
bell
rang
imperiously
twice
and
there
was
theobald
on
our
mat
in
a
yellow
jaeger
suit
with
a
chin
as
yellow
jutting
over
the
flaps
that
he
had
turned
up
to
hide
his
pyjamas
what
this
about
a
bad
night
said
he
he
could
sleep
and
he
would
let
me
i
whispered
never
loosening
my
grasp
of
the
door
and
standing
tight
against
the
other
wall
but
he
sleeping
like
a
baby
now
i
must
see
him
he
gave
strict
orders
that
you
should
not
i
his
medical
man
and
i
you
know
what
he
is
i
said
shrugging
the
least
thing
wakes
him
and
you
will
if
you
insist
on
seeing
him
now
it
will
be
the
last
time
i
warn
you
i
know
what
he
said
and
you
do
the
doctor
cursed
me
under
his
fiery
moustache
i
shall
come
up
during
the
course
of
the
morning
he
snarled
and
i
shall
tie
up
the
bell
i
said
and
if
it
does
ring
he
be
sleeping
still
but
i
will
not
risk
waking
him
by
coming
to
the
door
again
and
with
that
i
shut
it
in
his
face
i
was
improving
as
raffles
had
said
but
what
would
it
profit
me
if
some
evil
had
befallen
him
and
now
i
was
prepared
for
the
worst
a
boy
came
up
whistling
and
leaving
papers
on
the
mats
it
was
getting
on
for
eight
and
the
whiskey
and
soda
of
twelve
stood
untouched
and
stagnant
in
the
tumbler
if
the
worst
had
happened
to
raffles
i
felt
that
i
would
either
never
drink
again
or
else
seldom
do
anything
else
meanwhile
i
could
not
even
break
my
fast
but
roamed
the
flat
in
a
misery
not
to
be
described
my
very
linen
still
unchanged
my
cheeks
and
chin
now
tawny
from
the
unwholesome
night
how
long
would
it
go
on
i
wondered
for
a
time
then
i
changed
my
tune
how
long
could
i
endure
it
it
went
on
actually
until
the
forenoon
only
but
my
endurance
can
not
be
measured
by
the
time
for
to
me
every
hour
of
it
was
an
arctic
night
yet
it
can
not
have
been
much
after
eleven
when
the
ring
came
at
the
bell
which
i
had
forgotten
to
tie
up
after
all
but
this
was
not
the
doctor
neither
too
well
i
knew
was
it
the
wanderer
returned
our
bell
was
the
pneumatic
one
that
tells
you
if
the
touch
be
light
or
heavy
the
hand
upon
it
now
was
tentative
and
shy
the
owner
of
the
hand
i
had
never
seen
before
he
was
young
and
ragged
with
one
eye
blank
but
the
other
ablaze
with
some
fell
excitement
and
straightway
he
burst
into
a
low
torrent
of
words
of
which
all
i
knew
was
that
they
were
italian
and
therefore
news
of
raffles
if
only
i
had
known
the
language
but
might
help
us
somewhat
and
in
i
dragged
him
though
against
his
will
a
new
alarm
in
his
one
wild
eye
non
capite
he
cried
when
i
had
him
inside
and
had
withstood
the
torrent
no
i
bothered
if
i
do
i
answered
guessing
his
question
from
his
tone
vostro
amico
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
and
then
poco
tempo
poco
tempo
poco
tempo
for
once
in
my
life
the
classical
education
of
my
days
was
of
real
value
my
pal
my
pal
and
no
time
to
be
lost
i
translated
freely
and
flew
for
my
hat
ecco
signore
cried
the
fellow
snatching
the
watch
from
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
putting
one
black
on
the
long
hand
the
other
on
he
numeral
twelve
mezzogiorno
poco
tempo
poco
tempo
and
again
i
seized
his
meaning
that
it
was
twenty
past
eleven
and
we
must
be
there
by
twelve
but
where
but
where
it
was
maddening
to
be
summoned
like
this
and
not
to
know
what
had
happened
nor
to
have
any
means
of
finding
out
but
my
presence
of
mind
stood
by
me
still
i
was
improving
by
strides
and
i
crammed
my
handkerchief
between
the
drum
and
hammer
of
the
bell
before
leaving
the
doctor
could
ring
now
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
but
i
was
not
coming
and
he
need
not
think
it
i
half
expected
to
find
a
hansom
waiting
but
there
was
none
and
we
had
gone
some
distance
down
the
earl
court
road
before
we
got
one
in
fact
we
had
to
run
to
the
stand
opposite
is
the
church
with
the
clock
upon
it
as
everybody
knows
and
at
sight
of
the
dial
my
companion
had
wrung
his
hands
it
was
close
upon
the
poco
tempo
pochissimo
he
wailed
he
then
cried
to
the
cabman
numero
trentotto
bloomsbury
square
i
roared
on
my
own
account
i
show
you
the
house
when
we
get
there
only
drive
like
my
companion
lay
back
gasping
in
his
corner
the
small
glass
told
me
that
my
own
face
was
pretty
red
a
nice
show
i
cried
and
not
a
word
can
you
tell
me
did
you
bring
me
a
note
i
might
have
known
by
this
time
that
he
had
not
still
i
went
through
the
pantomime
of
writing
with
my
finger
on
my
cuff
but
he
shrugged
and
shook
his
head
niente
said
he
una
quistione
di
vita
di
vita
what
that
i
snapped
my
early
training
come
in
again
say
it
slowly
andante
rallentando
thank
italy
for
the
stage
instructions
in
the
songs
one
used
to
murder
the
fellow
actually
understood
una
quistione
di
vita
or
mors
eh
i
shouted
and
up
went
the
over
our
heads
avanti
avanti
avanti
cried
the
italian
turning
up
his
face
i
translated
and
double
fare
if
you
do
it
by
twelve
but
in
the
streets
of
london
how
is
one
to
know
the
time
in
the
earl
court
road
it
had
not
been
and
at
barker
in
high
street
it
was
but
a
minute
later
a
long
a
minute
that
was
going
like
the
wind
and
indeed
we
had
done
much
of
it
at
a
gallop
but
the
next
hundred
yards
took
us
five
minutes
by
the
next
clock
and
which
was
one
to
believe
i
fell
back
upon
my
own
old
watch
it
was
my
own
which
made
it
eighteen
minutes
to
the
hour
as
we
swung
across
the
serpentine
bridge
and
by
the
quarter
we
were
in
the
bayswater
road
not
up
for
once
presto
presto
my
pale
guide
murmured
affretatevi
avanti
ten
bob
if
you
do
it
i
cried
through
the
trap
without
the
slightest
notion
of
what
we
were
to
do
but
it
was
una
quistione
di
vita
and
vostro
amico
must
and
could
only
be
my
miserable
raffles
what
a
very
godsend
is
the
perfect
hansom
to
the
man
or
woman
in
a
hurry
it
had
been
our
great
good
fortune
to
jump
into
a
perfect
hansom
there
was
no
choice
we
had
to
take
the
first
upon
the
rank
but
it
must
have
deserved
its
place
with
the
rest
nowhere
new
tires
superb
springs
a
horse
in
a
thousand
and
a
driver
up
to
every
trick
of
his
trade
in
and
out
we
went
like
a
fast
at
the
rugby
game
yet
where
the
traffic
was
thinnest
there
were
we
and
how
he
knew
his
way
at
the
marble
arch
he
slipped
out
of
the
main
stream
and
so
into
wigmore
street
then
up
and
in
and
out
and
on
until
i
saw
the
gold
tips
of
the
museum
palisade
gleaming
between
the
horse
ears
in
the
sun
plop
plop
plop
ting
ling

bell
and
and
bell
until
the
colossal
figure
of
j
fox
in
a
grimy
toga
spelt
bloomsbury
square
with
my
watch
still
wanting
three
minutes
to
the
hour
what
number
cried
the
good
fellow
trentotto
trentotto
said
my
guide
but
he
was
looking
to
the
right
and
i
bundled
him
out
to
show
the
house
on
foot
i
had
not
after
all
but
i
flung
our
dear
driver
a
whole
one
instead
and
only
wish
that
it
had
been
a
hundred
already
the
italian
had
his
in
the
door
of
and
in
another
moment
we
were
rushing
up
the
narrow
stairs
of
as
dingy
a
london
house
as
prejudiced
countryman
can
conceive
it
was
panelled
but
it
was
dark
and
and
how
we
should
have
found
our
way
even
to
the
stairs
but
for
an
unwholesome
jet
of
yellow
gas
in
the
hall
i
can
not
myself
imagine
however
up
we
went
to
the
on
the
and
so
like
a
whirlwind
into
the
a
few
steps
higher
there
the
gas
was
also
burning
behind
closed
shutters
and
the
scene
is
photographed
upon
my
brain
though
i
can
not
have
looked
upon
it
for
a
whole
instant
as
i
sprang
in
at
my
leader
heels
this
room
also
was
panelled
and
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
on
our
left
his
hands
lashed
to
a
high
above
his
head
his
toes
barely
touching
the
floor
his
neck
pinioned
by
a
strap
passing
through
smaller
under
either
ear
and
every
inch
of
him
secured
on
the
same
principle
stood
or
rather
hung
all
that
was
left
of
raffles
for
at
the
first
glance
i
believed
him
dead
a
black
ruler
gagged
him
the
ends
lashed
behind
his
neck
the
blood
upon
it
caked
to
bronze
in
the
gaslight
and
in
front
of
him
ticking
like
a
its
only
hand
upon
the
stroke
of
twelve
stood
a
simple
grandfather
clock
but
not
for
half
an
instant
longer
only
until
my
guide
could
hurl
himself
upon
it
and
send
the
whole
thing
crashing
into
the
corner
an
report
accompanied
the
crash
a
white
cloud
lifted
from
the
fallen
clock
and
i
saw
a
revolver
smoking
in
a
vice
screwed
below
the
dial
an
arrangement
of
wires
sprouting
from
the
dial
itself
and
the
single
hand
at
once
at
its
zenith
and
in
contact
with
these
tumble
to
it
bunny
he
was
alive
these
were
his
first
words
the
italian
had
the
ruler
in
his
hand
and
with
his
knife
was
reaching
up
to
cut
the
thongs
that
lashed
the
hands
he
was
not
tall
enough
i
seized
him
and
lifted
him
up
then
fell
to
work
with
my
own
knife
upon
the
straps
and
raffles
smiled
faintly
upon
us
through
his
i
want
you
to
tumble
to
it
he
whispered
the
neatest
thing
in
revenge
i
ever
knew
and
another
minute
would
have
fixed
it
i
been
waiting
for
it
twelve
hours
watching
the
clock
round
death
at
the
end
of
the
lap
electric
connection
simple
enough
only
o
lord
we
had
cut
the
last
strap
he
could
not
stand
we
supported
him
between
us
to
a
horsehair
sofa
for
the
room
was
furnished
and
i
begged
him
not
to
speak
while
his
deliverer
was
at
the
door
before
raffles
recalled
him
with
a
sharp
word
in
italian
he
wants
to
get
me
a
drink
but
that
can
wait
said
he
in
firmer
voice
i
shall
enjoy
it
the
more
when
i
told
you
what
happened
do
let
him
go
bunny
put
your
back
against
the
door
he
a
decent
soul
and
it
lucky
for
me
i
got
a
word
with
him
before
they
trussed
me
up
i
promised
to
set
him
up
in
life
and
i
will
but
i
do
want
him
out
of
my
sight
for
the
moment
if
you
squared
him
last
night
i
exclaimed
why
the
blazes
did
he
come
to
me
till
the
eleventh
hour
ah
i
knew
he
have
to
cut
it
fine
though
i
hoped
not
quite
so
fine
as
all
that
but
all
well
that
ends
well
and
i
declare
i
do
feel
so
much
the
worse
i
shall
be
sore
about
the
gills
for
a
bit
and
what
do
you
think
he
pointed
to
the
long
black
ruler
with
the
bronze
stain
it
lay
upon
the
floor
he
held
out
his
hand
for
it
and
i
gave
it
to
him
the
same
one
i
gagged
him
with
said
raffles
with
his
still
ghastly
smile
he
was
a
bit
of
an
artist
old
corbucci
after
all
now
let
hear
how
you
fell
into
his
clutches
said
i
briskly
for
i
was
as
anxious
to
hear
as
he
seemed
to
tell
me
only
for
my
part
i
could
have
waited
until
we
were
safe
in
the
flat
i
do
want
to
get
it
off
my
chest
bunny
old
raffles
admitted
and
yet
i
hardly
can
tell
you
after
all
i
followed
your
friend
with
the
velvet
eyes
i
followed
him
all
the
way
here
of
course
i
came
up
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
house
when
he
let
himself
in
and
damme
if
he
had
left
the
door
ajar
who
could
resist
that
i
had
pushed
it
half
open
and
had
just
one
foot
on
the
mat
when
i
got
such
a
crack
on
the
head
as
i
hope
never
to
get
again
when
i
came
to
my
wits
they
were
hauling
me
up
to
that
by
the
hands
and
old
corbucci
himself
was
bowing
to
me
but
how
he
got
here
i
do
know
yet
i
can
tell
you
that
said
i
and
told
how
i
had
seen
the
count
for
myself
on
the
pavement
underneath
our
windows
moreover
i
continued
i
saw
him
spot
you
and
five
minutes
after
in
earl
court
road
i
was
told
he
driven
off
in
a
cab
he
would
see
you
following
his
man
drive
home
ahead
and
catch
you
by
having
the
door
left
open
in
the
way
you
describe
well
said
raffles
he
deserved
to
catch
me
somehow
for
he
come
from
naples
on
purpose
ruler
and
all
and
the
were
ready
fixed
and
even
this
house
taken
furnished
for
nothing
else
he
meant
catching
me
before
he
done
and
scoring
me
off
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
i
scored
off
him
only
going
one
better
of
course
he
told
me
so
himself
sitting
where
i
am
sitting
now
at
three
this
morning
and
smoking
a
most
abominable
cigar
that
i
smelt
ever
since
it
appears
he
sat
hours
when
i
left
him
trussed
up
but
he
said
twelve
would
content
him
in
my
case
as
there
was
certain
death
at
the
end
of
them
and
i
might
have
life
enough
left
to
appreciate
my
end
if
he
made
it
longer
but
i
would
have
trusted
him
if
he
could
have
got
the
clock
to
go
twice
round
without
firing
off
the
pistol
he
explained
the
whole
mechanism
of
that
to
me
he
had
thought
it
all
out
on
the
vineyard
i
told
you
about
and
then
he
asked
if
i
remembered
what
he
had
promised
me
in
the
name
of
the
camorra
i
only
remembered
some
vague
threats
but
he
was
good
enough
to
give
me
so
many
particulars
of
that
institution
that
i
could
make
a
european
reputation
by
exposing
the
whole
show
if
it
was
for
my
unfortunate
resemblance
to
that
infernal
rascal
raffles
do
you
think
they
would
know
me
at
the
yard
bunny
after
all
this
time
upon
my
soul
i
a
good
mind
to
risk
it
i
offered
no
opinion
on
the
point
how
could
it
interest
me
then
but
interested
i
was
in
raffles
never
more
so
in
my
life
he
had
been
tortured
all
night
and
half
a
day
yet
he
could
sit
and
talk
like
this
the
moment
we
cut
him
down
he
had
been
within
a
minute
of
his
death
yet
he
was
as
full
of
life
as
ever
and
defeated
at
the
best
he
could
still
smile
through
his
blood
as
though
the
boot
were
on
the
other
leg
i
had
imagined
that
i
knew
my
raffles
at
last
i
was
not
likely
so
to
flatter
myself
again
but
what
has
happened
to
these
villains
i
burst
out
and
my
indignation
was
not
only
against
them
for
their
cruelty
but
also
against
their
victim
for
his
phlegmatic
attitude
toward
them
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
this
was
raffles
oh
said
he
they
were
to
go
off
to
italy
instanter
they
should
be
crossing
now
but
do
listen
to
what
i
am
telling
you
interesting
my
dear
man
this
old
sinner
corbucci
turns
out
to
have
been
no
end
of
a
boss
in
the
camorra
says
so
himself
one
of
the
capi
paranze
my
boy
no
less
and
the
velvety
johnny
a
giovano
onorato
anglice
fresher
this
fellow
here
was
also
in
it
and
i
sworn
to
protect
him
from
them
evermore
and
it
just
as
i
said
half
the
in
london
belong
and
the
whole
lot
of
them
were
put
on
my
tracks
by
secret
instructions
this
excellent
youth
manufactures
iced
poison
on
saffron
hill
when
he
at
home
and
why
on
earth
did
he
come
to
me
quicker
because
he
could
talk
to
you
he
could
only
fetch
you
and
it
was
as
much
as
his
life
was
worth
to
do
that
before
our
friends
had
departed
they
were
going
by
the
eleven
from
victoria
and
that
did
leave
much
chance
but
he
certainly
ought
to
have
run
it
as
fine
as
he
did
still
you
must
remember
that
i
had
to
fix
things
up
with
him
in
the
fewest
possible
words
in
a
single
minute
that
the
other
two
were
indiscreet
enough
to
leave
us
alone
together
the
ragamuffin
in
question
was
watching
us
with
all
his
solitary
eye
as
though
he
knew
that
we
were
discussing
him
suddenly
he
broke
out
in
agonized
accents
his
hands
clasped
and
a
face
so
full
of
fear
that
every
moment
i
expected
to
see
him
on
his
knees
but
raffles
answered
kindly
reassuringly
i
could
tell
from
his
tone
and
then
turned
to
me
with
a
compassionate
shrug
he
says
he
could
find
the
mansions
bunny
and
really
it
not
to
be
wondered
at
i
had
only
time
to
tell
him
to
hunt
you
up
and
bring
you
here
by
hook
or
crook
before
twelve
and
after
all
he
has
done
that
but
now
the
poor
devil
thinks
you
riled
with
him
and
that
we
give
him
away
to
the
camorra
oh
it
not
with
him
i
riled
i
said
frankly
but
with
those
other
blackguards
and
and
with
you
old
chap
for
taking
it
all
as
you
do
while
such
infamous
scoundrels
have
the
last
laugh
and
are
safely
on
their
way
to
france
raffles
looked
up
at
me
with
a
curiously
open
eye
an
eye
that
i
never
saw
when
he
was
not
in
earnest
i
fancied
he
did
not
like
my
last
expression
but
one
after
all
it
was
no
laughing
matter
to
him
but
are
they
said
he
i
not
so
sure
you
said
they
were
i
said
they
should
be
did
you
hear
them
go
i
heard
nothing
but
the
clock
all
night
it
was
like
big
ben
striking
at
the
last
striking
nine
to
the
fellow
on
the
drop
and
in
that
open
eye
i
saw
at
last
a
deep
glimmer
of
the
ordeal
through
which
he
had
passed
but
my
dear
old
raffles
if
they
still
on
the
premises
the
thought
was
too
thrilling
for
a
finished
sentence
i
hope
they
are
he
said
grimly
going
to
the
door
there
a
gas
on
was
that
burning
when
you
came
in
now
that
i
thought
of
it
yes
it
had
been
and
there
a
frightfully
foul
smell
i
added
as
i
followed
raffles
down
the
stairs
he
turned
to
me
gravely
with
his
hand
upon
the
door
and
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
a
coat
with
an
astrakhan
collar
hanging
on
the
pegs
they
are
in
here
bunny
he
said
and
turned
the
handle
the
door
would
only
open
a
few
inches
but
a
detestable
odor
came
out
with
a
broad
bar
of
yellow
gaslight
raffles
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
nose
i
followed
his
example
signing
to
our
ally
to
do
the
same
and
in
another
minute
we
had
all
three
squeezed
into
the
room
the
man
with
the
yellow
boots
was
lying
against
the
door
the
great
carcass
sprawled
upon
the
table
and
at
a
glance
it
was
evident
that
both
men
had
been
dead
some
hours
the
old
camorrist
had
the
stem
of
a
between
his
swollen
blue
fingers
one
of
which
had
been
cut
in
the
breakage
and
the
livid
flesh
was
also
brown
with
the
last
blood
that
it
would
ever
shed
his
face
was
on
the
table
the
huge
moustache
projecting
from
under
either
leaden
cheek
yet
looking
itself
strangely
alive
broken
bread
and
scraps
of
frozen
macaroni
lay
upon
the
cloth
and
at
the
bottom
of
two
and
a
tureen
the
macaroni
had
a
tinge
of
tomato
and
there
was
a
crimson
dram
left
in
the
tumblers
with
an
empty
fiasco
to
show
whence
it
came
but
near
the
great
gray
head
upon
the
table
another
stood
unbroken
and
still
full
of
some
white
and
stinking
liquid
and
near
that
a
tiny
silver
flask
which
made
me
recoil
from
raffles
as
i
had
not
from
the
dead
for
i
knew
it
to
be
his
come
out
of
this
poisonous
air
he
said
sternly
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
has
happened
so
we
all
three
gathered
together
in
the
hall
but
it
was
raffles
who
stood
nearest
the
his
back
to
it
his
eyes
upon
us
two
and
though
it
was
to
me
only
that
he
spoke
at
first
he
would
pause
from
point
to
point
and
translate
into
italian
for
the
benefit
of
the
alien
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
you
probably
do
even
know
the
name
bunny
he
began
of
the
deadliest
poison
yet
known
to
science
it
is
cyanide
of
cacodyl
and
i
have
carried
that
small
flask
of
it
about
with
me
for
months
where
i
got
it
matters
nothing
the
whole
point
is
that
a
mere
sniff
reduces
flesh
to
clay
i
have
never
had
any
opinion
of
suicide
as
you
know
but
i
always
felt
it
worth
while
to
be
forearmed
against
the
very
worst
well
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
is
calculated
to
stiffen
an
ordinary
roomful
of
ordinary
people
within
five
minutes
and
i
remembered
my
flask
when
they
had
me
as
good
as
crucified
in
the
small
hours
of
this
morning
i
asked
them
to
take
it
out
of
my
pocket
i
begged
them
to
give
me
a
drink
before
they
left
me
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
did
i
thought
of
many
things
but
suggested
none
while
raffles
turned
this
much
of
his
statement
into
sufficiently
fluent
italian
but
when
he
faced
me
again
his
face
was
still
flaming
that
beast
corbucci
said
he
how
can
i
pity
him
he
took
the
flask
he
would
give
me
none
he
flicked
me
in
the
face
instead
my
idea
was
that
he
at
least
should
go
with
me
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
that
and
a
sniff
would
have
settled
us
both
but
no
he
must
tantalize
and
torment
me
he
thought
it
brandy
he
must
take
it
downstairs
to
drink
to
my
destruction
can
you
have
any
pity
for
a
hound
like
that
let
us
go
i
at
last
said
hoarsely
as
raffles
finished
speaking
in
italian
and
his
second
listener
stood
we
will
go
said
raffles
and
we
will
chance
being
seen
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
this
good
chap
will
prove
that
i
have
been
tied
up
since
one
this
morning
and
the
medical
evidence
will
decide
how
long
those
dogs
have
been
dead
but
the
worst
did
not
come
to
the
worst
more
power
to
my
unforgotten
friend
the
cabman
who
never
came
forward
to
say
what
manner
of
men
he
had
driven
to
bloomsbury
square
at
top
speed
on
the
very
day
upon
which
the
tragedy
was
discovered
there
or
whence
he
had
driven
them
to
be
sure
they
had
not
behaved
like
murderers
whereas
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
all
went
to
show
that
the
defunct
corbucci
was
little
better
his
reputation
which
transpired
with
his
identity
was
that
of
a
libertine
and
a
renegade
while
the
infernal
apparatus
upstairs
revealed
the
fiendish
arts
of
the
anarchist
to
boot
the
inquiry
resulted
eventually
in
an
open
verdict
and
was
chiefly
instrumental
in
killing
such
compassion
as
is
usually
felt
for
the
dead
who
die
in
their
sins
but
raffles
would
not
have
passed
this
title
for
this
tale
to
catch
a
thief
i
society
persons
are
not
likely
to
have
forgotten
the
series
of
audacious
robberies
by
which
so
many
of
themselves
suffered
in
turn
during
the
brief
course
of
a
recent
season
raid
after
raid
was
made
upon
the
smartest
houses
in
town
and
within
a
few
weeks
more
than
one
exalted
head
had
been
shorn
of
its
priceless
tiara
the
duke
and
duchess
of
dorchester
lost
half
the
portable
pieces
of
their
historic
plate
on
the
very
night
of
their
graces
almost
equally
historic
costume
ball
the
kenworthy
diamonds
were
taken
in
broad
daylight
during
the
excitement
of
a
charitable
meeting
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
gifts
of
her
belted
bridegroom
to
lady
may
paulton
while
the
outer
air
was
thick
with
a
prismatic
shower
of
confetti
it
was
obvious
that
all
this
was
the
work
of
no
ordinary
thief
and
perhaps
inevitable
that
the
name
of
raffles
should
have
been
dragged
from
oblivion
by
callous
disrespecters
of
the
departed
and
unreasoning
apologists
for
the
police
these
wiseacres
did
not
hesitate
to
bring
a
dead
man
back
to
life
because
they
knew
of
no
living
one
capable
of
such
feats
it
is
their
heedless
and
inconsequent
calumnies
that
the
present
paper
is
partly
intended
to
refute
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
joint
innocence
in
this
matter
was
only
exceeded
by
our
common
envy
and
for
a
long
time
like
the
rest
of
the
world
neither
of
us
had
the
slightest
clew
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
was
following
in
our
steps
with
such
irritating
results
i
should
mind
less
said
raffles
if
the
fellow
were
really
playing
my
game
but
abuse
of
hospitality
was
never
one
of
my
strokes
and
it
seems
to
me
the
only
shot
he
got
when
we
took
old
lady
necklace
bunny
we
were
not
staying
with
the
melroses
if
you
recollect
we
were
discussing
the
robberies
for
the
hundredth
time
but
for
once
under
conditions
more
favorable
to
animated
conversation
than
our
unique
circumstances
permitted
in
the
flat
we
did
not
often
dine
out
theobald
was
one
impediment
the
risk
of
recognition
was
another
but
there
were
exceptions
when
the
doctor
was
away
or
the
patient
defiant
and
on
these
rare
occasions
we
frequented
a
certain
unpretentious
restaurant
in
the
fulham
quarter
where
the
cooking
was
plain
but
excellent
and
the
cellar
a
surprise
our
bottle
of
champagne
was
empty
to
the
label
when
the
subject
arose
to
be
touched
by
raffles
in
the
reminiscent
manner
indicated
above
i
can
see
his
clear
eye
upon
me
now
reading
me
weighing
me
but
i
was
not
so
sensitive
to
his
scrutiny
at
the
time
his
tone
was
deliberate
calculating
preparatory
not
as
i
heard
it
then
through
a
head
full
of
wine
but
as
it
floats
back
to
me
across
the
gulf
between
that
moment
and
this
excellent
fillet
said
i
grossly
so
you
think
this
chap
is
as
much
in
society
as
we
were
do
you
i
preferred
not
to
think
so
myself
we
had
cause
enough
for
jealousy
without
that
but
raffles
raised
his
eyebrows
an
eloquent
as
much
my
dear
bunny
he
is
not
only
in
it
but
of
it
there
no
comparison
between
us
there
society
is
in
rings
like
a
target
and
we
never
were
in
the
however
thick
you
may
lay
on
the
ink
i
was
asked
for
my
cricket
i
have
forgotten
it
yet
but
this
fellow
one
of
themselves
with
the
right
of
entre
into
the
houses
which
we
could
only
in
a
professional
sense
that
obvious
unless
all
these
little
exploits
are
the
work
of
different
hands
which
they
as
obviously
are
not
and
it
why
i
give
five
hundred
pounds
to
put
salt
on
him
not
you
said
i
as
i
drained
my
glass
in
festive
incredulity
but
i
would
my
dear
bunny
waiter
another
of
this
and
raffles
leant
across
the
table
as
the
empty
one
was
taken
away
i
never
was
more
serious
in
my
life
he
continued
below
his
breath
whatever
else
our
successor
may
be
he
not
a
dead
man
like
me
or
a
marked
man
like
you
if
there
any
truth
in
my
theory
he
one
of
the
last
people
upon
whom
suspicion
is
ever
likely
to
rest
and
oh
bunny
what
a
partner
he
would
make
for
you
and
me
under
less
genial
influences
the
very
idea
of
a
third
partner
would
have
filled
my
soul
with
offence
but
raffles
had
chosen
his
moment
unerringly
and
his
arguments
lost
nothing
by
the
flowing
accompaniment
of
the
extra
pint
they
were
however
quite
strong
in
themselves
the
gist
of
them
was
that
thus
far
we
had
remarkably
little
to
show
for
what
raffles
would
call
our
second
innings
this
even
i
could
not
deny
we
had
scored
a
few
long
singles
but
our
best
shots
had
gone
straight
to
hand
and
we
were
playing
a
deuced
slow
game
therefore
we
needed
a
new
partner
and
the
metaphor
failed
raffles
it
had
served
its
turn
i
already
agreed
with
him
in
truth
i
was
tired
of
my
false
position
as
hireling
attendant
and
had
long
fancied
myself
an
object
of
suspicion
to
that
other
impostor
the
doctor
a
fresh
untrammelled
start
was
a
fascinating
idea
to
me
though
two
was
company
and
three
in
our
case
might
be
worse
than
none
but
i
did
not
see
how
we
could
hope
with
our
respective
handicaps
to
solve
a
problem
which
was
already
the
despair
of
scotland
yard
suppose
i
have
solved
it
observed
raffles
cracking
a
walnut
in
his
palm
how
could
you
i
asked
without
believing
for
an
instant
that
he
had
i
have
been
taking
the
morning
post
for
some
time
now
well
you
have
got
me
a
good
many
odd
numbers
of
the
less
base
society
papers
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
what
you
driving
at
raffles
smiled
indulgently
as
he
cracked
another
nut
that
because
you
neither
observation
nor
imagination
bunny
and
yet
you
try
to
write
well
you
would
think
it
but
i
have
a
fairly
complete
list
of
the
people
who
were
at
the
various
functions
under
cover
of
which
these
different
little
coups
were
brought
off
i
said
very
stolidly
that
i
did
not
see
how
that
could
help
him
it
was
the
only
answer
to
his
but
contempt
it
happened
also
to
be
true
think
said
raffles
in
a
patient
voice
when
thieves
break
in
and
steal
said
i
upstairs
i
do
see
much
point
in
discovering
who
was
downstairs
at
the
time
quite
said
raffles
when
they
do
break
in
but
that
what
they
have
done
in
all
these
cases
an
upstairs
door
found
screwed
up
when
things
were
at
their
height
below
thief
gone
and
jewels
with
him
before
alarm
could
be
raised
why
the
trick
so
old
that
i
never
knew
you
condescend
to
play
it
not
so
old
as
it
looks
said
raffles
choosing
the
cigars
and
handing
me
mine
cognac
or
benedictine
bunny
brandy
i
said
coarsely
besides
he
went
on
the
rooms
were
not
screwed
up
at
dorchester
house
at
any
rate
the
door
was
only
locked
and
the
key
missing
so
that
it
might
have
been
done
on
either
side
but
that
was
where
he
left
his
behind
him
i
exclaimed
in
triumph
but
raffles
only
shook
his
head
i
do
believe
in
that
bunny
except
as
a
blind
then
what
on
earth
do
you
believe
that
every
one
of
these
burglaries
has
been
done
from
the
inside
by
one
of
the
guests
and
what
more
i
very
much
mistaken
if
i
have
spotted
the
right
sportsman
i
began
to
believe
that
he
really
had
there
was
such
a
wicked
gravity
in
the
eyes
that
twinkled
faintly
into
mine
i
raised
my
glass
in
convivial
congratulation
and
still
remember
the
somewhat
anxious
eye
with
which
raffles
saw
it
emptied
i
can
only
find
one
likely
name
he
continued
that
figures
in
all
these
lists
and
it
is
anything
but
a
likely
one
at
first
sight
lord
ernest
belville
was
at
all
those
functions
know
anything
about
him
bunny
not
the
rational
drink
fanatic
yes
that
all
i
want
to
know
quite
said
raffles
and
yet
what
could
be
more
promising
a
man
whose
views
are
so
broad
and
moderate
and
so
widely
held
already
saving
your
presence
bunny
does
not
bore
the
world
with
them
without
ulterior
motives
so
far
so
good
what
are
this
motives
does
he
want
to
advertise
himself
no
he
somebody
already
but
is
he
rich
on
the
contrary
he
as
poor
as
a
rat
for
his
position
and
apparently
without
the
least
ambition
to
be
anything
else
certainly
he
wo
enrich
himself
by
making
a
public
fad
of
what
all
sensible
people
are
agreed
upon
as
it
is
then
suddenly
one
gets
one
own
old
idea
the
alternative
profession
my
cricket
his
rational
drink
but
it
is
no
use
jumping
to
conclusions
i
must
know
more
than
the
newspapers
can
tell
me
our
aristocratic
friend
is
forty
and
unmarried
what
has
he
been
doing
all
these
years
how
the
devil
was
i
to
find
out
how
did
you
i
asked
declining
to
spoil
my
digestion
with
a
conundrum
as
it
was
his
evident
intention
that
i
should
interviewed
him
said
raffles
smiling
slowly
on
my
amazement
you
interviewed
him
i
echoed
when
and
where
last
thursday
night
when
if
you
remember
we
kept
early
hours
because
i
felt
done
what
was
the
use
of
telling
you
what
i
had
up
my
sleeve
bunny
it
might
have
ended
in
fizzle
as
it
still
may
but
lord
ernest
belville
was
addressing
the
meeting
at
exeter
hall
i
waited
for
him
when
the
show
was
over
dogged
him
home
to
king
mansions
and
interviewed
him
in
his
own
rooms
there
before
he
turned
in
my
journalistic
jealousy
was
piqued
to
the
quick
affecting
a
scepticism
i
did
not
feel
for
no
outrage
was
beyond
the
pale
of
his
impudence
i
inquired
dryly
which
journal
raffles
had
pretended
to
represent
it
is
unnecessary
to
report
his
answer
i
could
not
believe
him
without
further
explanation
i
should
have
thought
he
said
that
even
you
would
have
spotted
a
practice
i
never
omit
upon
certain
occasions
i
always
pay
a
visit
to
the
and
fill
my
waistcoat
pocket
from
the
it
is
an
immense
help
in
any
little
temporary
impersonation
on
thursday
night
i
sent
up
the
card
of
a
powerful
writer
connected
with
a
powerful
paper
if
lord
ernest
had
known
him
in
the
flesh
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
confess
to
a
journalistic
ruse
luckily
he
did
and
i
had
been
sent
by
my
editor
to
get
the
interview
for
next
morning
what
could
be
better
for
the
alternative
profession
i
inquired
what
the
interview
had
brought
forth
everything
said
raffles
lord
ernest
has
been
a
wanderer
these
twenty
years
texas
fiji
australia
i
suspect
him
of
wives
and
families
in
all
three
but
his
manners
are
a
liberal
education
he
gave
me
some
beautiful
whiskey
and
forgot
all
about
his
fad
he
is
strong
and
subtle
but
i
talked
him
off
his
guard
he
is
going
to
the
kirkleathams
i
saw
the
card
stuck
up
i
stuck
some
wax
into
his
keyhole
as
he
was
switching
off
the
lights
and
with
an
eye
upon
the
waiters
raffles
showed
me
a
skeleton
key
newly
twisted
and
filed
but
my
share
of
the
extra
pint
i
am
afraid
no
fair
share
had
made
me
dense
i
looked
from
the
key
to
raffles
with
puckered
forehead
for
i
happened
to
catch
sight
of
it
in
the
mirror
behind
him
the
dowager
lady
kirkleatham
he
whispered
has
diamonds
as
big
as
beans
and
likes
to
have
all
on
and
goes
to
bed
early
and
happens
to
be
in
town
and
now
i
saw
the
villain
means
to
get
them
from
her
and
i
mean
to
get
them
from
the
villain
said
raffles
or
rather
your
share
and
mine
will
he
consent
to
a
partnership
we
shall
have
him
at
our
mercy
he
dare
refuse
raffles
plan
was
to
gain
access
to
lord
ernest
rooms
before
midnight
there
we
were
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
aristocratic
rascal
and
if
i
left
all
details
to
raffles
and
simply
stood
by
in
case
of
a
rumpus
i
should
be
playing
my
part
and
earning
my
share
it
was
a
part
that
i
had
played
before
not
always
with
a
good
grace
though
there
had
never
been
any
question
about
the
share
but
i
was
nothing
loath
i
had
had
just
champagne
enough
how
raffles
knew
my
measure
and
i
was
ready
and
eager
for
anything
indeed
i
did
not
wish
to
wait
for
the
coffee
which
was
to
be
especially
strong
by
order
of
raffles
but
on
that
he
insisted
and
it
was
between
ten
and
eleven
when
at
last
we
were
in
our
cab
it
would
be
fatal
to
be
too
early
he
said
as
we
drove
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
dangerous
to
leave
it
too
late
one
must
risk
something
how
i
should
love
to
drive
down
piccadilly
and
see
the
lights
but
unnecessary
risks
are
another
story
ii
king
john
mansions
as
everybody
knows
are
the
oldest
the
ugliest
and
the
tallest
block
of
flats
in
all
london
but
they
are
built
upon
a
more
generous
scale
than
has
since
become
the
rule
and
with
a
less
studious
regard
for
the
economy
of
space
we
were
about
to
drive
into
the
spacious
courtyard
when
the
checked
us
in
order
to
let
another
hansom
drive
out
it
contained
a
man
of
the
military
type
like
ourselves
in
evening
dress
that
much
i
saw
as
his
hansom
crossed
our
bows
because
i
could
not
help
seeing
it
but
i
should
not
have
given
the
incident
a
second
thought
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
extraordinary
effect
upon
raffles
in
an
instant
he
was
out
upon
the
curb
paying
the
cabby
and
in
another
he
was
leading
me
across
the
street
away
from
the
mansions
where
on
earth
are
you
going
i
naturally
exclaimed
into
the
park
said
he
we
are
too
early
his
voice
told
me
more
than
his
words
it
was
strangely
stern
was
that
him
in
the
hansom
it
was
well
then
the
coast
clear
said
i
comfortably
i
was
for
turning
back
then
and
there
but
raffles
forced
me
on
with
a
hand
that
hardened
on
my
arm
it
was
a
nearer
thing
than
i
care
about
said
he
this
seat
will
do
no
the
next
one
further
from
a
we
will
give
him
a
good
and
i
do
want
to
talk
we
had
been
seated
some
minutes
when
big
ben
sent
a
languid
chime
over
our
heads
to
the
stars
it
was
ten
and
a
sultry
night
eleven
had
struck
before
raffles
awoke
from
his
sullen
reverie
and
recalled
me
from
mine
with
a
slap
on
the
back
in
a
couple
of
minutes
we
were
in
the
lighted
vestibule
at
the
inner
end
of
the
courtyard
of
king
john
mansions
just
left
lord
ernest
at
lady
kirkleatham
said
raffles
gave
me
his
key
and
asked
us
to
wait
for
him
in
his
rooms
will
you
send
us
up
in
the
lift
in
a
small
way
i
never
knew
old
raffles
do
anything
better
there
was
not
an
instant
demur
lord
ernest
belville
rooms
were
at
the
top
of
the
building
but
we
were
in
them
as
quickly
as
lift
could
carry
and
conduct
us
and
there
was
no
need
for
the
skeleton
key
after
all
the
boy
opened
the
outer
door
with
one
of
his
own
and
switched
on
the
lights
before
leaving
us
now
that
interesting
said
raffles
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
they
can
come
in
and
clean
when
he
is
out
what
if
he
keeps
his
swag
at
the
bank
by
jove
that
an
idea
for
him
i
do
believe
he
getting
rid
of
it
it
all
lying
low
somewhere
if
i
not
mistaken
and
not
a
fool
while
he
spoke
he
was
moving
about
the
which
was
charmingly
furnished
in
the
antique
style
and
making
as
many
remarks
as
though
he
were
an
auctioneer
clerk
with
an
inventory
to
prepare
and
a
day
to
do
it
in
instead
of
a
cracksman
who
might
be
surprised
in
his
crib
at
any
moment
chippendale
of
sorts
eh
bunny
not
genuine
of
course
but
where
can
you
get
genuine
chippendale
now
and
who
knows
it
when
they
see
it
there
no
merit
in
mere
antiquity
yet
the
way
people
pose
on
the
subject
if
a
thing
handsome
and
useful
and
good
it
good
enough
for
me
had
we
better
explore
the
whole
place
i
suggested
nervously
he
had
not
even
bolted
the
outer
door
nor
would
he
when
i
called
his
attention
to
the
omission
if
lord
ernest
finds
his
rooms
locked
up
he
raise
cain
said
raffles
we
must
let
him
come
in
and
lock
up
for
himself
before
we
corner
him
but
he
wo
come
yet
if
he
did
it
might
be
awkward
for
they
tell
him
down
below
what
i
told
them
a
new
staff
comes
on
at
midnight
i
discovered
that
the
other
night
supposing
he
does
come
in
before
well
he
ca
have
us
turned
out
without
first
seeing
who
we
are
and
he
wo
try
it
on
when
i
had
one
word
with
him
unless
my
suspicions
are
unfounded
i
mean
is
it
about
time
to
test
them
my
good
bunny
what
do
you
suppose
i
been
doing
all
this
while
he
keeps
nothing
in
here
there
is
a
lock
to
the
chippendale
that
you
could
pick
with
a
penknife
and
not
a
loose
board
in
the
floor
for
i
was
treading
for
one
before
the
boy
left
us
chimney
no
use
in
a
place
like
this
where
they
keep
them
swept
for
you
yes
i
quite
ready
to
try
his
bedroom
there
was
but
a
bathroom
besides
no
kitchen
no
servant
room
neither
are
necessary
in
king
john
mansions
i
thought
it
as
well
to
put
my
head
inside
the
bathroom
while
raffles
went
into
the
bedroom
for
i
was
tormented
by
the
horrible
idea
that
the
man
might
all
this
time
be
concealed
somewhere
in
the
flat
but
the
bathroom
blazed
void
in
the
electric
light
i
found
raffles
hanging
out
of
the
starry
square
which
was
the
bedroom
window
for
the
room
was
still
in
darkness
i
felt
for
the
switch
at
the
door
put
it
out
again
said
raffles
fiercely
he
rose
from
the
sill
drew
blind
and
curtains
carefully
then
switched
on
the
light
himself
it
fell
upon
a
face
creased
more
in
pity
than
in
anger
and
raffles
only
shook
his
head
as
i
hung
mine
it
all
right
old
boy
said
he
but
corridors
have
windows
too
and
servants
have
eyes
and
you
and
i
are
supposed
to
be
in
the
other
room
not
in
this
but
cheer
up
bunny
this
is
the
room
look
at
the
extra
bolt
on
the
door
he
had
that
put
on
and
there
an
iron
ladder
to
his
window
in
case
of
fire
way
of
escape
ready
against
the
hour
of
need
he
a
better
man
than
i
thought
him
bunny
after
all
but
you
may
bet
your
bottom
dollar
that
if
there
any
boodle
in
the
flat
it
in
this
room
yet
the
room
was
very
lightly
furnished
and
nothing
was
locked
we
looked
everywhere
but
we
looked
in
vain
the
wardrobe
was
filled
with
hanging
coats
and
trousers
in
a
press
the
drawers
with
the
softest
silk
and
finest
linen
it
was
a
camp
bedstead
that
would
not
have
unsettled
an
anchorite
there
was
no
place
for
treasure
there
i
looked
up
the
chimney
but
raffles
told
me
not
to
be
a
fool
and
asked
if
i
ever
listened
to
what
he
said
there
was
no
question
about
his
temper
now
i
never
knew
him
in
a
worse
then
he
has
got
it
in
the
bank
he
growled
i
swear
i
not
mistaken
in
my
man
i
had
the
tact
not
to
differ
with
him
there
but
i
could
not
help
suggesting
that
now
was
our
time
to
remedy
any
mistake
we
might
have
made
we
were
on
the
right
side
of
midnight
still
then
we
stultify
ourselves
downstairs
said
raffles
no
i
be
shot
if
i
do
he
may
come
in
with
the
kirkleatham
diamonds
you
do
what
you
like
bunny
but
i
do
budge
i
certainly
sha
leave
you
i
retorted
to
be
knocked
into
the
middle
of
next
week
by
a
better
man
than
yourself
i
had
borrowed
his
own
tone
and
he
did
not
like
it
they
never
do
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
raffles
was
going
to
strike
me
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
he
could
if
he
liked
my
blood
was
up
i
was
ready
to
send
him
to
the
devil
and
i
emphasized
my
offence
by
nodding
and
shrugging
toward
a
pair
of
very
large
indian
clubs
that
stood
in
the
fender
on
either
side
of
the
chimney
up
which
i
had
presumed
to
glance
in
an
instant
raffles
had
seized
the
clubs
and
was
whirling
them
about
his
gray
head
in
a
mixture
of
childish
pique
and
puerile
bravado
which
i
should
have
thought
him
altogether
above
and
suddenly
as
i
watched
him
his
face
changed
softened
lit
up
and
he
swung
the
clubs
gently
down
upon
the
bed
they
not
heavy
enough
for
their
size
said
he
rapidly
and
take
my
oath
they
not
the
same
weight
he
shook
one
club
after
the
other
with
both
hands
close
to
his
ear
then
he
examined
their
under
the
electric
light
i
saw
what
he
suspected
now
and
caught
the
contagion
of
his
suppressed
excitement
neither
of
us
spoke
but
raffles
had
taken
out
the
portable
that
he
called
a
knife
and
always
carried
and
as
he
opened
the
gimlet
he
handed
me
the
club
he
held
instinctively
i
tucked
the
small
end
under
my
arm
and
presented
the
other
to
raffles
hold
him
tight
he
whispered
smiling
he
not
only
a
better
man
than
i
thought
him
bunny
he
hit
upon
a
better
dodge
than
ever
i
did
of
its
kind
only
i
should
have
weighted
them
evenly
to
a
hair
he
had
screwed
the
gimlet
into
the
circular
butt
close
to
the
edge
and
now
we
were
wrenching
in
opposite
directions
for
a
moment
or
more
nothing
happened
then
all
at
once
something
gave
and
raffles
swore
an
oath
as
soft
as
any
prayer
and
for
the
minute
after
that
his
hand
went
round
and
round
with
the
gimlet
as
though
he
were
grinding
a
while
the
end
wormed
slowly
out
on
its
delicate
thread
of
fine
hard
wood
the
clubs
were
as
hollow
as
the
pair
of
them
for
we
went
from
one
to
the
other
without
pausing
to
undo
the
padded
packets
that
poured
out
upon
the
bed
these
were
deliciously
heavy
to
the
hand
yet
thickly
swathed
in
so
that
some
stuck
together
retaining
the
shape
of
the
cavity
as
though
they
had
been
run
out
of
a
mould
and
when
we
did
open
them
but
let
raffles
speak
he
had
deputed
me
to
screw
in
the
ends
of
the
clubs
and
to
replace
the
latter
in
the
fender
where
we
had
found
them
when
i
had
done
the
counterpane
was
glittering
with
diamonds
where
it
was
not
shimmering
with
pearls
if
this
is
that
tiara
that
lady
may
was
married
in
said
raffles
and
that
disappeared
out
of
the
room
she
changed
in
while
it
rained
confetti
on
the
steps
i
present
it
to
her
instead
of
the
one
she
lost
it
was
stupid
to
keep
these
old
gold
spoons
valuable
as
they
are
they
made
the
difference
in
the
weight
here
we
have
probably
the
kenworthy
diamonds
i
do
know
the
history
of
these
pearls
this
looks
like
one
family
of
rings
left
on
the
perhaps
alas
poor
lady
and
that
the
lot
our
eyes
met
across
the
bed
what
it
all
worth
i
asked
hoarsely
impossible
to
say
but
more
than
all
we
ever
took
in
all
our
lives
that
i
swear
to
more
than
all
my
tongue
swelled
with
the
thought
but
it
take
some
turning
into
cash
old
chap
and
must
it
be
a
partnership
i
asked
finding
a
lugubrious
voice
at
length
partnership
be
damned
cried
raffles
heartily
let
get
out
quicker
than
we
came
in
we
pocketed
the
things
between
us
and
all
not
because
we
wanted
the
latter
but
to
remove
all
immediate
traces
of
our
really
meritorious
deed
the
sinner
wo
dare
to
say
a
word
when
he
does
find
out
remarked
raffles
of
lord
ernest
but
that
no
reason
why
he
should
find
out
before
he
must
everything
straight
in
here
i
think
no
better
leave
the
window
open
as
it
was
and
the
blind
up
now
out
with
the
light
one
peep
at
the
other
room
that
all
right
too
out
with
the
passage
light
bunny
while
i
open
his
words
died
away
in
a
whisper
a
key
was
fumbling
at
the
lock
outside
out
with
it
out
with
it
whispered
raffles
in
an
agony
and
as
i
obeyed
he
picked
me
off
my
feet
and
swung
me
bodily
but
silently
into
the
bedroom
just
as
the
outer
door
opened
and
a
masterful
step
strode
in
the
next
five
were
horrible
minutes
we
heard
the
apostle
of
rational
drink
unlock
one
of
the
deep
drawers
in
his
antique
sideboard
and
sounds
followed
suspiciously
like
the
splash
of
spirits
and
the
steady
stream
from
a
siphon
never
before
or
since
did
i
experience
such
a
thirst
as
assailed
me
at
that
moment
nor
do
i
believe
that
many
tropical
explorers
have
known
its
equal
but
i
had
raffles
with
me
and
his
hand
was
as
steady
and
as
cool
as
the
hand
of
a
trained
nurse
that
i
know
because
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
my
overcoat
for
me
for
some
reason
and
buttoned
it
at
the
throat
i
afterwards
found
that
he
had
done
the
same
to
his
own
but
i
did
not
hear
him
doing
it
the
one
thing
i
heard
in
the
bedroom
was
a
tiny
metallic
click
muffled
and
deadened
in
his
overcoat
pocket
and
it
not
only
removed
my
last
tremor
but
strung
me
to
a
higher
pitch
of
excitement
than
ever
yet
i
had
then
no
conception
of
the
game
that
raffles
was
deciding
to
play
and
that
i
was
to
play
with
him
in
another
minute
it
can
not
have
been
longer
before
lord
ernest
came
into
his
bedroom
heavens
but
my
heart
had
not
forgotten
how
to
thump
we
were
standing
near
the
door
and
i
could
swear
he
touched
me
then
his
boots
creaked
there
was
a
rattle
in
the
fender
and
raffles
switched
on
the
light
lord
ernest
belville
crouched
in
its
glare
with
one
indian
club
held
by
the
end
like
a
footman
with
a
stolen
bottle
a
man
but
a
fool
and
a
weakling
at
that
moment
if
he
had
never
been
either
before
lord
ernest
belville
said
raffles
it
no
use
this
is
a
loaded
revolver
and
if
you
force
me
i
shall
use
it
on
you
as
i
would
on
any
other
desperate
criminal
i
am
here
to
arrest
you
for
a
series
of
robberies
at
the
duke
of
dorchester
sir
john
kenworthy
and
other
noblemen
and
gentlemen
houses
during
the
present
season
better
drop
what
you
got
in
your
hand
it
empty
lord
ernest
lifted
the
club
an
inch
or
two
and
with
it
his
eyebrows
and
after
it
his
stalwart
frame
as
the
club
crashed
back
into
the
fender
and
as
he
stood
at
his
full
height
a
courteous
but
ironic
smile
under
the
cropped
moustache
he
looked
what
he
was
criminal
or
not
scotland
yard
said
he
that
our
affair
my
lord
i
did
think
they
got
it
in
them
said
lord
ernest
now
i
recognize
you
you
my
interviewer
no
i
did
think
any
of
you
fellows
had
got
all
that
in
you
come
into
the
other
room
and
show
you
something
else
oh
keep
me
covered
by
all
means
but
look
at
this
on
the
antique
sideboard
their
size
doubled
by
reflection
in
the
polished
mahogany
lay
a
coruscating
cluster
of
precious
stones
that
fell
in
festoons
about
lord
ernest
fingers
as
he
handed
them
to
raffles
with
scarcely
a
shrug
the
kirkleatham
diamonds
said
he
better
add
to
the
bag
raffles
did
so
without
a
smile
with
his
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
his
tall
hat
pressed
down
to
his
eyes
and
between
the
two
his
incisive
features
and
his
keen
stern
glance
he
looked
the
ideal
detective
of
fiction
and
the
stage
what
looked
god
knows
but
i
did
my
best
to
glower
and
show
my
teeth
at
his
side
i
had
thrown
myself
into
the
game
and
it
was
obviously
a
winning
one
would
take
a
share
i
suppose
lord
ernest
said
casually
raffles
did
not
condescend
to
reply
i
rolled
back
my
lips
like
a
then
a
drink
at
least
my
mouth
watered
but
raffles
shook
his
head
impatiently
we
must
be
going
my
lord
and
you
will
have
to
come
with
us
i
wondered
what
in
the
world
we
should
do
with
him
when
we
had
got
him
give
me
time
to
put
some
things
together
pair
of
pyjamas
and
do
you
know
i
can
not
give
you
many
minutes
my
lord
but
i
do
want
to
cause
a
disturbance
here
so
i
tell
them
to
call
a
cab
if
you
like
but
i
shall
be
back
in
a
minute
and
you
must
be
ready
in
five
here
inspector
you
better
keep
this
while
i
am
gone
and
i
was
left
alone
with
that
dangerous
criminal
raffles
nipped
my
arm
as
he
handed
me
the
revolver
but
i
got
small
comfort
out
of
that
incorruptible
inquired
lord
ernest
as
we
stood
face
to
face
you
do
corrupt
me
i
replied
through
naked
teeth
then
come
into
my
room
i
lead
the
way
think
you
can
hit
me
if
i
misbehave
i
put
the
bed
between
us
without
a
second
delay
my
prisoner
flung
a
upon
it
and
tossed
things
into
it
with
a
dejected
air
suddenly
as
he
was
fitting
them
in
without
raising
his
head
which
i
was
watching
his
right
hand
closed
over
the
barrel
with
which
i
covered
him
you
better
not
shoot
he
said
a
knee
upon
his
side
of
the
bed
if
you
do
it
may
be
as
bad
for
you
as
it
will
be
for
me
i
tried
to
wrest
the
revolver
from
him
i
will
if
you
force
me
i
hissed
you
better
not
he
repeated
smiling
and
now
i
saw
that
if
i
did
i
should
only
shoot
into
the
bed
or
my
own
legs
his
hand
was
on
the
top
of
mine
bending
it
down
and
the
revolver
with
it
the
strength
of
it
was
as
the
strength
of
ten
of
mine
and
now
both
his
knees
were
on
the
bed
and
suddenly
i
saw
his
other
hand
doubled
into
a
fist
coming
up
slowly
over
the
help
i
called
feebly
help
forsooth
i
begin
to
believe
you
are
from
the
yard
he
said
and
his
came
with
the
yard
it
caught
me
under
the
chin
it
lifted
me
off
my
legs
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
the
crash
that
i
made
in
falling
iii
raffles
was
standing
over
me
when
i
recovered
consciousness
i
lay
stretched
upon
the
bed
across
which
that
blackguard
belville
had
struck
his
knavish
blow
the
was
on
the
floor
but
its
dastardly
owner
had
disappeared
is
he
gone
was
my
first
faint
question
thank
god
you
not
anyway
replied
raffles
with
what
struck
me
then
as
mere
flippancy
i
managed
to
raise
myself
upon
one
elbow
i
meant
lord
ernest
belville
said
i
with
dignity
are
you
quite
sure
that
he
cleared
out
raffles
waved
a
hand
towards
the
window
which
stood
wide
open
to
the
summer
stars
of
course
said
he
and
by
the
route
i
intended
him
to
take
gone
by
the
as
i
hoped
he
would
what
on
earth
should
we
have
done
with
him
my
poor
dear
bunny
i
thought
you
take
a
bribe
but
it
really
more
convincing
as
it
is
and
just
as
well
for
lord
ernest
to
be
convinced
for
the
time
being
are
you
sure
he
is
i
questioned
as
i
found
a
rather
shaky
pair
of
legs
of
course
cried
raffles
again
in
the
tone
to
make
one
blush
for
the
least
misgiving
on
the
point
not
that
it
matters
one
bit
he
added
airily
for
we
have
him
either
way
and
when
he
does
tumble
to
it
as
he
may
any
minute
he
wo
dare
to
open
his
mouth
then
the
sooner
we
clear
out
the
better
said
i
but
i
looked
askance
at
the
open
window
for
my
head
was
spinning
still
when
you
feel
up
to
it
returned
raffles
we
shall
stroll
out
and
i
shall
do
myself
the
honor
of
ringing
for
the
lift
the
force
of
habit
is
too
strong
in
you
bunny
i
shall
shut
the
window
and
leave
everything
exactly
as
we
found
it
lord
ernest
will
probably
tumble
before
he
is
badly
missed
and
then
he
may
come
back
to
put
salt
on
us
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
he
can
do
even
if
he
succeeds
come
bunny
pull
yourself
together
and
you
be
a
different
man
when
you
in
the
open
air
and
for
a
while
i
felt
one
such
was
my
relief
at
getting
out
of
those
infernal
mansions
with
unfettered
wrists
this
we
managed
easily
enough
but
once
more
raffles
performance
of
a
small
part
was
no
less
perfect
than
his
more
ambitious
work
upstairs
and
something
of
the
successful
artist
elation
possessed
him
as
we
walked
across
james
park
it
was
long
since
i
had
known
him
so
pleased
with
himself
and
only
too
long
since
he
had
had
such
reason
i
do
think
i
ever
had
a
brighter
idea
in
my
life
he
said
never
thought
of
it
till
he
was
in
the
next
room
never
dreamt
of
its
coming
off
so
ideally
even
then
and
did
much
care
because
we
had
him
all
ways
up
i
only
sorry
you
let
him
knock
you
out
i
was
waiting
outside
the
door
all
the
time
and
it
made
me
sick
to
hear
it
but
i
once
broke
my
own
head
bunny
if
you
remember
and
not
in
half
such
an
excellent
cause
raffles
touched
all
his
pockets
in
his
turn
the
pockets
that
contained
a
small
fortune
apiece
and
he
smiled
in
my
face
as
we
crossed
the
lighted
avenues
of
the
mall
next
moment
he
was
hailing
a
hansom
for
i
suppose
i
was
still
pretty
pale
and
not
a
word
would
he
let
me
speak
until
we
had
alighted
as
near
as
was
prudent
to
the
flat
what
a
brute
i
been
bunny
he
whispered
then
but
you
take
half
the
swag
old
boy
and
right
well
you
earned
it
no
we
go
in
by
the
wrong
door
and
over
the
roof
it
too
late
for
old
theobald
to
be
still
at
the
play
and
too
early
for
him
to
be
safely
in
his
cups
so
we
climbed
the
many
stairs
with
stealth
and
like
cats
crept
out
upon
the
grimy
leads
but
they
were
no
blacker
than
their
canopy
of
sky
not
a
stood
out
against
the
starless
night
one
had
to
feel
one
way
in
order
to
avoid
tripping
over
the
low
parapets
of
the
wells
that
ran
from
roof
to
basement
to
light
the
inner
rooms
one
of
these
wells
was
spanned
by
a
flimsy
bridge
with
iron
handrails
that
felt
warm
to
the
touch
as
raffles
led
the
way
across
a
hotter
and
a
closer
night
i
have
never
known
the
flat
will
be
like
an
oven
i
grumbled
at
the
head
of
our
own
staircase
then
we
wo
go
down
said
raffles
promptly
we
slack
it
up
here
for
a
bit
instead
no
bunny
you
stay
where
you
are
i
fetch
you
a
drink
and
a
and
you
sha
come
down
till
you
feel
more
fit
and
i
let
him
have
his
way
i
will
not
say
as
usual
for
i
had
even
less
than
my
normal
power
of
resistance
that
night
that
villainous
my
head
still
sang
and
throbbed
as
i
seated
myself
on
one
of
the
aforesaid
parapets
and
buried
it
in
my
hot
hands
nor
was
the
night
one
to
dispel
a
headache
there
was
distinct
thunder
in
the
air
thus
i
sat
in
a
heap
and
brooded
over
my
misadventure
a
pretty
figure
of
a
subordinate
villain
until
the
step
came
for
which
i
waited
and
it
never
struck
me
that
it
came
from
the
wrong
direction
you
have
been
quick
said
i
simply
yes
hissed
a
voice
i
recognized
and
you
got
to
be
quicker
still
here
out
with
your
wrists
no
one
at
a
time
and
if
you
utter
a
syllable
you
a
dead
man
it
was
lord
ernest
belville
his
moustache
gleamed
through
the
darkness
drawn
up
over
his
set
teeth
in
his
hand
glittered
a
pair
of
handcuffs
and
before
i
knew
it
one
had
snapped
its
jaws
about
my
right
wrist
now
come
this
way
said
lord
ernest
showing
me
a
revolver
also
and
wait
for
your
friend
and
recollect
a
single
syllable
of
warning
will
be
your
death
with
that
the
ruffian
led
me
to
the
very
bridge
i
had
just
crossed
at
raffles
heels
and
handcuffed
me
to
the
iron
rail
midway
across
the
chasm
it
no
longer
felt
warm
to
my
touch
but
icy
as
the
blood
in
all
my
veins
so
this
hypocrite
had
beaten
us
at
our
game
and
his
and
raffles
had
met
his
match
at
last
that
was
the
most
intolerable
thought
that
raffles
should
be
down
in
the
flat
on
my
account
and
that
i
could
not
warn
him
of
his
impending
fate
for
how
was
it
possible
without
making
such
an
outcry
as
should
bring
the
mansions
about
our
ears
and
there
i
shivered
on
that
wretched
plank
chained
like
andromeda
to
the
rock
with
a
black
infinity
above
and
below
and
before
my
eyes
now
grown
familiar
with
the
peculiar
darkness
stood
lord
ernest
belville
waiting
for
raffles
to
emerge
with
full
hands
and
unsuspecting
heart
taken
so
horribly
unawares
even
raffles
must
fall
an
easy
prey
to
a
desperado
in
resource
and
courage
scarcely
second
to
himself
but
one
whom
he
had
fatally
underrated
from
the
beginning
not
that
i
paused
to
think
how
the
thing
had
happened
my
one
concern
was
for
what
was
to
happen
next
and
what
did
happen
was
worse
than
my
worst
foreboding
for
first
a
light
came
flickering
into
the
sort
of
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
finally
raffles
in
his
he
was
not
only
carrying
a
candle
to
put
the
finishing
touch
to
him
as
a
target
he
had
dispensed
with
coat
and
waistcoat
downstairs
and
was
at
once
and
unarmed
where
are
you
old
chap
he
cried
softly
himself
blinded
by
the
light
he
carried
and
he
advanced
a
couple
of
steps
towards
belville
this
is
you
is
it
and
raffles
stopped
his
candle
held
on
high
a
folding
chair
under
the
other
arm
no
i
am
not
your
friend
replied
lord
ernest
easily
but
kindly
remain
standing
exactly
where
you
are
and
do
lower
that
candle
an
inch
unless
you
want
your
brains
blown
into
the
street
raffles
said
never
a
word
but
for
a
moment
did
as
he
was
bid
and
the
unshaken
flame
of
the
candle
was
testimony
alike
to
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
to
the
finest
set
of
nerves
in
europe
then
to
my
horror
he
coolly
stooped
placing
candle
and
chair
on
the
leads
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
as
though
it
were
but
a
popgun
that
covered
him
why
did
you
shoot
he
asked
insolently
as
he
rose
frightened
of
the
noise
i
should
be
too
with
an
machine
like
that
all
very
well
for
service
in
the
field
but
on
the
at
dead
of
night
i
shall
shoot
however
replied
lord
ernest
as
quietly
in
his
turn
and
with
less
insolence
and
chance
the
noise
unless
you
instantly
restore
my
property
i
am
glad
you
do
dispute
the
last
word
he
continued
after
a
slight
pause
there
is
no
keener
honor
than
that
which
subsists
or
ought
to
subsist
among
thieves
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
soon
spotted
you
as
one
of
the
fraternity
not
in
the
beginning
mind
you
for
the
moment
i
did
think
you
were
one
of
these
smart
detectives
jumped
to
life
from
some
sixpenny
magazine
but
to
preserve
the
illusion
you
ought
to
provide
yourself
with
a
worthier
lieutenant
it
was
he
who
gave
your
show
away
chuckled
the
wretch
dropping
for
a
moment
the
affected
style
of
speech
which
seemed
intended
to
enhance
our
humiliation
smart
detectives
do
go
about
with
little
innocents
to
assist
them
you
need
be
anxious
about
him
by
the
way
it
was
necessary
to
pitch
him
into
the
street
he
is
to
be
seen
though
not
heard
if
you
look
in
the
right
direction
nor
must
you
put
all
the
blame
upon
your
friend
it
was
not
he
but
you
who
made
so
sure
that
i
had
got
out
by
the
window
you
see
i
was
in
my
bathroom
all
the
time
with
the
door
open
the
bathroom
eh
raffles
echoed
with
professional
interest
and
you
followed
us
on
foot
across
the
park
of
course
and
then
in
a
cab
and
afterwards
on
foot
once
more
the
simplest
skeleton
would
let
you
in
down
below
i
saw
the
lower
half
of
lord
ernest
face
grinning
in
the
light
of
the
candle
set
between
them
on
the
ground
you
follow
every
move
said
he
there
can
be
no
doubt
you
are
one
of
the
fraternity
and
i
should
wonder
if
we
had
formed
our
style
upon
the
same
model
ever
know
j
raffles
the
abrupt
question
took
my
breath
away
but
raffles
himself
did
not
lose
an
instant
over
his
answer
intimately
said
he
that
accounts
for
you
then
laughed
lord
ernest
as
it
does
for
me
though
i
never
had
the
honor
of
the
master
acquaintance
nor
is
it
for
me
to
say
which
is
the
worthier
disciple
perhaps
however
now
that
your
friend
is
handcuffed
in
and
you
yourself
are
at
my
mercy
you
will
concede
me
some
little
temporary
advantage
and
his
face
split
in
another
grin
from
the
cropped
moustache
downward
as
i
saw
no
longer
by
candlelight
but
by
a
flash
of
lightning
which
tore
the
sky
in
two
before
raffles
could
reply
you
have
the
bulge
at
present
admitted
raffles
but
you
have
still
to
lay
hands
upon
your
or
our
goods
to
shoot
me
is
not
necessarily
to
do
so
to
bring
either
one
of
us
to
a
violent
end
is
only
to
court
a
yet
more
violent
and
infinitely
more
disgraceful
one
for
yourself
family
considerations
alone
should
rule
that
risk
out
of
your
game
now
an
hour
or
two
ago
when
the
exact
opposite
the
remainder
of
raffles
speech
was
drowned
from
my
ears
by
the
belated
crash
of
thunder
which
the
lightning
had
foretold
so
loud
however
was
the
crash
when
it
came
that
the
storm
was
evidently
approaching
us
at
a
high
velocity
yet
as
the
last
echo
rumbled
away
i
heard
raffles
talking
as
though
he
had
never
stopped
you
offered
us
a
share
he
was
saying
unless
you
mean
to
murder
us
both
in
cold
blood
it
will
be
worth
your
while
to
repeat
that
offer
we
should
be
dangerous
enemies
you
had
far
better
make
the
best
of
us
as
friends
lead
the
way
down
to
your
flat
said
lord
ernest
with
a
flourish
of
his
service
revolver
and
perhaps
we
may
talk
about
it
it
is
for
me
to
make
the
terms
i
imagine
and
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
going
to
get
wet
to
the
skin
up
here
the
rain
was
beginning
in
great
drops
even
as
he
spoke
and
by
a
second
flash
of
lightning
i
saw
raffles
pointing
to
me
but
what
about
my
friend
said
he
and
then
came
the
second
peal
oh
he
all
right
the
great
brute
replied
do
him
good
you
catch
me
letting
myself
in
for
two
to
one
you
will
find
it
equally
difficult
rejoined
raffles
to
induce
me
to
leave
my
friend
to
the
mercy
of
a
night
like
this
he
has
not
recovered
from
the
blow
you
struck
him
in
your
own
rooms
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
blame
you
for
that
but
you
are
a
worse
sportsman
than
i
take
you
for
if
you
think
of
leaving
him
where
he
is
if
he
stays
however
so
do
i
and
just
as
it
ceased
raffles
voice
seemed
distinctly
nearer
to
me
but
in
the
darkness
and
the
rain
which
was
now
as
heavy
as
hail
i
could
see
nothing
clearly
the
rain
had
already
extinguished
the
candle
i
heard
an
oath
from
belville
a
laugh
from
raffles
and
for
a
second
that
was
all
raffles
was
coming
to
me
and
the
other
could
not
even
see
to
fire
that
was
all
i
knew
in
the
pitchy
interval
of
invisible
rain
before
the
next
crash
and
the
next
flash
and
then
this
time
they
came
together
and
not
till
my
dying
hour
shall
i
forget
the
sight
that
the
lightning
lit
and
the
thunder
applauded
raffles
was
on
one
of
the
parapets
of
the
gulf
that
my
spanned
and
in
the
sudden
illumination
he
stepped
across
it
as
one
might
across
a
garden
path
the
width
was
scarcely
greater
but
the
depth
in
the
sudden
flare
i
saw
to
the
concrete
bottom
of
the
well
and
it
looked
no
larger
than
the
hollow
of
my
hand
raffles
was
laughing
in
my
ear
he
had
the
iron
railing
fast
it
was
between
us
but
his
foothold
was
as
secure
as
mine
lord
ernest
belville
on
the
contrary
was
the
fifth
of
a
second
late
for
the
light
and
half
a
foot
short
in
his
spring
something
struck
our
plank
bridge
so
hard
as
to
set
it
quivering
like
a
there
was
half
a
gasp
and
half
a
sob
in
beneath
our
feet
and
then
a
sound
far
below
that
i
prefer
not
to
describe
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
hit
upon
the
perfect
simile
it
is
more
than
enough
for
me
that
i
can
hear
it
still
and
with
that
sickening
sound
came
the
loudest
clap
of
thunder
yet
and
a
great
white
glare
that
showed
us
our
enemy
body
far
below
with
one
white
hand
spread
like
a
starfish
but
the
head
of
him
mercifully
twisted
underneath
it
was
all
his
own
fault
bunny
poor
devil
may
he
and
all
of
us
be
forgiven
but
pull
yourself
together
for
your
own
sake
well
you
fall
stay
where
you
are
a
minute
i
remember
the
uproar
of
the
elements
while
raffles
was
gone
no
other
sound
mingled
with
it
not
the
opening
of
a
single
window
not
the
uplifting
of
a
single
voice
then
came
raffles
with
soap
and
water
and
the
gyve
was
wheedled
from
one
wrist
as
you
withdraw
a
ring
for
which
the
finger
has
grown
too
large
of
the
rest
i
only
remember
shivering
till
morning
in
a
flat
whose
invalid
occupier
was
for
once
the
nurse
and
i
his
patient
and
that
is
the
true
ending
of
the
episode
in
which
we
two
set
ourselves
to
catch
one
of
our
own
kidney
albeit
in
another
place
i
have
shirked
the
whole
truth
it
is
not
a
grateful
task
to
show
raffles
as
completely
at
fault
as
he
really
was
on
that
occasion
nor
do
i
derive
any
subtle
satisfaction
from
recounting
my
own
twofold
humiliation
or
from
having
assisted
never
so
indirectly
in
the
death
of
a
not
uncongenial
sinner
the
truth
however
has
after
all
a
merit
of
its
own
and
the
great
kinsfolk
of
poor
lord
ernest
have
but
little
to
lose
by
its
divulgence
it
would
seem
that
they
knew
more
of
the
real
character
of
the
apostle
of
rational
drink
than
was
known
at
exeter
hall
the
tragedy
was
indeed
hushed
up
as
tragedies
only
are
when
they
occur
in
such
circles
but
the
rumor
that
did
get
abroad
as
to
the
class
of
enterprise
which
the
poor
scamp
was
pursuing
when
he
met
his
death
can
not
be
too
soon
exploded
since
it
breathed
upon
the
fair
fame
of
some
of
the
most
respectable
flats
in
kensington
an
old
flame
i
the
square
shall
be
nameless
but
if
you
drive
due
west
from
piccadilly
the
will
eventually
find
it
on
his
left
and
he
ought
to
thank
you
for
two
shillings
it
is
not
a
fashionable
square
but
there
are
few
with
a
finer
garden
while
the
studios
on
the
south
side
lend
distinction
of
another
sort
the
houses
however
are
small
and
dingy
and
about
the
last
to
attract
the
expert
practitioner
in
search
of
a
crib
heaven
knows
it
was
with
no
such
thought
i
trailed
raffles
thither
one
unlucky
evening
at
the
latter
end
of
that
same
season
when
theobald
had
at
last
insisted
upon
the
which
i
had
foreseen
in
the
beginning
trees
whispered
in
the
green
garden
aforesaid
and
the
cool
smooth
lawns
looked
so
inviting
that
i
wondered
whether
some
philanthropic
resident
could
not
be
induced
to
lend
us
the
key
but
raffles
would
not
listen
to
the
suggestion
when
i
stopped
to
make
it
and
what
was
worse
i
found
him
looking
wistfully
at
the
little
houses
instead
such
balconies
bunny
a
leg
up
and
there
you
would
be
i
expressed
a
conviction
that
there
would
be
nothing
worth
taking
in
the
square
but
took
care
to
have
him
under
way
again
as
i
spoke
i
daresay
you
right
sighed
raffles
rings
and
watches
i
suppose
but
it
would
be
hard
luck
to
take
them
from
people
who
live
in
houses
like
these
i
do
know
though
here
one
with
an
extra
story
stop
bunny
if
you
do
stop
i
hold
on
to
the
railings
this
is
a
good
house
look
at
the
knocker
and
the
electric
bell
they
had
that
put
in
there
some
money
here
my
rabbit
i
dare
bet
there
a
in
the
and
the
windows
are
wide
open
electric
light
too
by
jove
since
stop
i
must
i
had
done
so
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
in
the
shadow
of
the
leafy
palings
and
as
raffles
spoke
the
ground
floor
windows
opposite
had
flown
alight
showing
as
pretty
a
little
as
one
could
wish
to
see
with
a
man
at
his
wine
at
the
far
end
and
the
back
of
a
lady
in
evening
dress
toward
us
it
was
like
a
thrown
upon
a
screen
there
were
only
the
pair
of
them
but
the
table
was
brilliant
with
silver
and
gay
with
flowers
and
the
maid
waited
with
the
indefinable
air
of
a
good
servant
it
certainly
seemed
a
good
house
she
going
to
let
down
the
blind
whispered
raffles
in
high
excitement
no
confound
them
they
told
her
not
to
mark
down
her
necklace
bunny
and
invoice
his
stud
what
a
brute
he
looks
but
i
like
the
table
and
that
her
show
she
has
the
taste
but
he
must
have
money
see
the
festive
picture
over
the
sideboard
looks
to
me
like
a
jacques
saillard
but
that
would
be
good
enough
for
me
get
on
said
i
you
in
a
but
the
whole
square
at
dinner
we
should
have
the
ball
at
our
feet
it
would
take
two
twos
with
those
blinds
up
and
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
underneath
he
nodded
leaning
forward
in
the
chair
his
hands
upon
the
wraps
about
his
legs
you
must
be
mad
said
i
and
got
back
to
my
handles
with
the
word
but
when
i
tugged
the
chair
ran
light
keep
an
eye
on
the
rug
came
in
a
whisper
from
the
middle
of
the
road
and
there
stood
my
invalid
his
pale
face
in
a
quiver
of
pure
mischief
yet
set
with
his
insane
resolve
i
only
going
to
see
whether
that
woman
has
a
we
do
want
it
it
wo
take
a
minute
it
madness
madness
then
do
you
wait
it
was
like
him
to
leave
me
with
that
and
this
time
i
had
taken
him
at
his
last
word
had
not
my
own
given
me
an
idea
mad
i
had
called
him
and
mad
i
could
declare
him
upon
oath
if
necessary
it
was
not
as
though
the
thing
had
happened
far
from
home
they
could
learn
all
about
us
at
the
nearest
mansions
i
referred
them
to
theobald
this
was
a
maturin
one
of
his
patients
and
i
was
his
keeper
and
he
had
never
given
me
the
slip
before
i
heard
myself
making
these
explanations
on
the
doorstep
and
pointing
to
the
deserted
as
the
proof
while
the
pretty
parlor
maid
ran
for
the
police
it
would
be
a
more
serious
matter
for
me
than
for
my
charge
i
should
lose
my
place
no
he
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
and
i
would
answer
for
it
that
he
never
should
again
i
saw
myself
conducting
raffles
back
to
his
chair
with
a
firm
hand
and
a
stern
tongue
i
heard
him
thanking
me
in
whispers
on
the
way
home
it
would
be
the
first
tight
place
i
had
ever
got
him
out
of
and
i
was
quite
anxious
for
him
to
get
into
it
so
sure
was
i
of
every
move
my
whole
position
had
altered
in
the
few
seconds
that
it
took
me
to
follow
this
illuminating
train
of
ideas
it
was
now
so
strong
that
i
could
watch
raffles
without
much
anxiety
and
he
was
worth
watching
he
had
stepped
boldly
but
softly
to
the
front
door
and
there
he
was
still
waiting
ready
to
ring
if
the
door
opened
or
a
face
appeared
in
the
area
and
doubtless
to
pretend
that
he
had
rung
already
but
he
had
not
to
ring
at
all
and
suddenly
i
saw
his
foot
in
the
his
left
hand
on
the
lintel
overhead
it
was
thrilling
even
to
a
hardened
accomplice
with
an
explanation
up
his
sleeve
a
tight
grip
with
that
left
hand
of
his
as
he
leant
backward
with
all
his
weight
upon
those
five
fingers
a
right
arm
stretched
outward
and
upward
to
its
last
inch
and
the
base
of
the
low
projecting
balcony
was
safely
caught
i
looked
down
and
took
breath
the
maid
was
removing
the
crumbs
in
the
lighted
room
and
the
square
was
empty
as
before
what
a
blessing
it
was
the
end
of
the
season
many
of
the
houses
remained
in
darkness
i
looked
up
again
and
raffles
was
drawing
his
left
leg
over
the
balcony
railing
in
another
moment
he
had
disappeared
through
one
of
the
french
windows
which
opened
upon
the
balcony
and
in
yet
another
he
had
switched
on
the
electric
light
within
this
was
bad
enough
for
now
i
at
least
could
see
everything
he
did
but
the
crowning
folly
was
still
to
come
there
was
no
point
in
it
the
mad
thing
was
done
for
my
benefit
as
i
knew
at
once
and
he
afterward
confessed
but
the
lunatic
reappeared
on
the
balcony
bowing
like
a
mountebank
in
his
crape
mask
i
set
off
with
the
empty
chair
but
i
came
back
i
could
not
desert
old
raffles
even
when
i
would
but
must
try
to
explain
away
his
mask
as
well
if
he
had
not
the
sense
to
take
it
off
in
time
it
would
be
difficult
but
burglaries
are
not
usually
committed
from
a
and
for
the
rest
i
put
my
faith
in
theobald
meanwhile
raffles
had
at
least
withdrawn
from
the
balcony
and
now
i
could
only
see
his
head
as
he
peered
into
a
cabinet
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
it
was
like
the
opera
of
aida
in
which
two
scenes
are
enacted
simultaneously
one
in
the
dungeon
below
the
other
in
the
temple
above
in
the
same
fashion
my
attention
now
became
divided
between
the
picture
of
raffles
moving
stealthily
about
the
upper
room
and
that
of
the
husband
and
wife
at
table
underneath
and
all
at
once
as
the
man
replenished
his
glass
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
woman
pushed
back
her
chair
and
sailed
to
the
door
raffles
was
standing
before
the
fireplace
upstairs
he
had
taken
one
of
the
framed
photographs
from
the
and
was
scanning
it
at
suicidal
length
through
the
in
the
hideous
mask
which
he
still
wore
he
would
need
it
after
all
the
lady
had
left
the
room
below
opening
and
shutting
the
door
for
herself
the
man
was
filling
his
glass
once
more
i
would
have
shrieked
my
warning
to
raffles
so
fatally
engrossed
overhead
but
at
this
moment
of
all
others
a
constable
of
all
men
was
marching
sedately
down
our
side
of
the
square
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
a
melancholy
eye
upon
the
and
to
ask
the
constable
the
time
i
was
evidently
to
be
kept
there
all
night
i
remarked
and
only
realized
with
the
words
that
they
disposed
of
my
other
explanations
before
they
were
uttered
it
was
a
horrible
moment
for
such
a
discovery
fortunately
the
enemy
was
on
the
pavement
from
which
he
could
scarcely
have
seen
more
than
the
ceiling
had
he
looked
but
he
was
not
many
houses
distant
when
a
door
opened
and
a
woman
gasped
so
that
i
heard
both
across
the
road
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
subsequent
tableaux
in
the
lighted
room
behind
the
low
balcony
and
the
french
windows
raffles
stood
confronted
by
a
dark
and
handsome
woman
whose
profile
as
i
saw
it
first
in
the
electric
light
is
cut
like
a
cameo
in
my
memory
it
had
the
undeviating
line
of
brow
and
nose
the
short
upper
lip
the
perfect
chin
that
are
united
in
marble
oftener
than
in
the
flesh
and
like
marble
she
stood
or
rather
like
some
beautiful
pale
bronze
for
that
was
her
coloring
and
she
lost
none
of
it
that
i
could
see
neither
trembled
but
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
and
that
was
all
so
she
stood
without
flinching
before
a
masked
ruffian
who
i
felt
would
be
the
first
to
appreciate
her
courage
to
me
it
was
so
superb
that
i
could
think
of
it
in
this
way
even
then
and
marvel
how
raffles
himself
could
stand
unabashed
before
so
brave
a
figure
he
had
not
to
do
so
long
the
woman
scorned
him
and
he
stood
unmoved
a
framed
photograph
still
in
his
hand
then
with
a
quick
determined
movement
she
turned
not
to
the
door
or
to
the
bell
but
to
the
open
window
by
which
raffles
had
entered
and
this
with
that
accursed
policeman
still
in
view
so
far
no
word
had
passed
between
the
pair
but
at
this
point
raffles
said
something
i
could
not
hear
what
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
woman
wheeled
and
raffles
was
looking
humbly
in
her
face
the
crape
mask
snatched
from
his
own
arthur
she
cried
and
that
might
have
been
heard
in
the
middle
of
the
square
garden
then
they
stood
gazing
at
each
other
neither
unmoved
any
more
and
while
they
stood
the
opened
and
banged
it
was
her
husband
leaving
the
house
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
but
a
dissipated
face
and
a
step
even
now
distinguished
by
the
extreme
caution
which
precedes
unsteadiness
he
broke
the
spell
his
wife
came
to
the
balcony
then
looked
back
into
the
room
and
yet
again
along
the
road
and
this
time
i
saw
her
face
it
was
the
face
of
one
glancing
indeed
from
hyperion
to
a
satyr
and
then
i
saw
the
rings
flash
as
her
hand
fell
gently
upon
raffles
arm
they
disappeared
from
that
window
their
heads
showed
for
an
instant
in
the
next
then
they
dipped
out
of
sight
and
an
inner
ceiling
flashed
out
under
a
new
light
they
had
gone
into
the
back
beyond
my
ken
the
maid
came
up
with
coffee
her
mistress
hastily
met
her
at
the
door
and
once
more
disappeared
the
square
was
as
quiet
as
ever
i
remained
some
minutes
where
i
was
now
and
then
i
thought
i
heard
their
voices
in
the
back
i
was
seldom
sure
my
state
of
mind
may
be
imagined
by
those
readers
who
take
an
interest
in
my
personal
psychology
it
does
not
amuse
me
to
look
back
upon
it
but
at
length
i
had
the
sense
to
put
myself
in
raffles
place
he
had
been
recognized
at
last
he
had
come
to
life
only
one
person
knew
as
yet
but
that
person
was
a
woman
and
a
woman
who
had
once
been
fond
of
him
if
the
human
face
could
speak
would
she
keep
his
secret
would
he
tell
her
where
he
lived
it
was
terrible
to
think
we
were
such
neighbors
and
with
the
thought
that
it
was
terrible
came
a
little
enlightenment
as
to
what
could
still
be
done
for
the
best
he
would
not
tell
her
where
he
lived
i
knew
him
too
well
for
that
he
would
run
for
it
when
he
could
and
the
and
i
must
not
be
there
to
give
him
away
i
dragged
the
infernal
vehicle
round
the
nearer
corner
then
i
waited
there
could
be
no
harm
in
that
and
at
last
he
came
he
was
walking
briskly
so
i
was
right
and
he
had
not
played
the
invalid
to
her
yet
i
heard
him
cry
out
with
pleasure
as
he
turned
the
corner
and
he
flung
himself
into
the
chair
with
a
sigh
that
did
me
good
well
done
bunny
well
done
i
am
on
my
way
to
earl
court
capable
of
following
me
but
she
wo
look
for
me
in
a
home
home
home
and
not
another
word
till
we
get
there
capable
of
following
him
she
overtook
us
before
we
were
past
the
studios
on
the
south
side
of
the
square
the
woman
herself
in
a
hooded
but
she
never
gave
us
a
glance
and
we
saw
her
turn
safely
in
the
right
direction
for
earl
court
and
the
wrong
one
for
our
humble
mansions
raffles
thanked
his
gods
in
a
voice
that
trembled
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
in
the
flat
then
for
once
it
was
raffles
who
filled
the
tumblers
and
found
the
cigarettes
and
for
once
and
once
only
in
all
my
knowledge
of
him
did
he
drain
his
glass
at
a
draught
you
did
see
the
balcony
scene
he
asked
at
length
and
they
were
his
first
words
since
the
woman
passed
us
on
his
track
do
you
mean
when
she
came
in
no
when
i
came
down
i
did
i
hope
nobody
else
saw
it
said
raffles
devoutly
i
do
say
that
romeo
and
juliet
were
brother
and
sister
to
us
but
you
might
have
said
so
bunny
he
was
staring
at
the
carpet
with
as
wry
a
face
as
lover
ever
wore
an
old
flame
said
i
gently
a
married
woman
he
groaned
so
i
gathered
but
she
always
was
one
bunny
said
he
ruefully
that
the
trouble
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
saw
the
difference
but
said
i
did
not
see
how
it
could
make
any
now
he
had
eluded
the
lady
after
all
had
we
not
seen
her
off
upon
a
scent
as
false
as
scent
could
be
there
was
occasion
for
redoubled
caution
in
the
future
but
none
for
immediate
anxiety
i
quoted
the
bedside
theobald
but
raffles
did
not
smile
his
eyes
had
been
downcast
all
this
time
and
now
when
he
raised
them
i
perceived
that
my
comfort
had
been
administered
to
deaf
ears
do
you
know
who
she
is
said
he
not
from
eve
jacques
saillard
he
said
as
though
now
i
must
know
but
the
name
left
me
cold
and
stolid
i
had
heard
it
but
that
was
all
it
was
lamentable
ignorance
i
am
aware
but
i
had
specialized
in
letters
at
the
expense
of
art
you
must
know
her
pictures
said
raffles
patiently
but
i
suppose
you
thought
she
was
a
man
they
would
appeal
to
you
bunny
that
festive
piece
over
the
sideboard
was
her
work
sometimes
they
risk
her
at
the
academy
sometimes
they
fight
shy
she
has
one
of
those
studios
in
the
same
square
they
used
to
live
up
near
lord
my
mind
was
busy
brightening
a
dim
memory
of
nymphs
reflected
in
woody
pools
of
course
i
exclaimed
and
added
something
about
a
clever
woman
raffles
rose
at
the
phrase
a
clever
woman
he
echoed
scornfully
if
she
were
only
that
i
should
feel
safe
as
houses
clever
women
ca
forget
their
cleverness
they
carry
it
as
badly
as
a
boy
does
his
wine
and
are
about
as
dangerous
i
do
call
jacques
saillard
clever
outside
her
art
but
neither
do
i
call
her
a
woman
at
all
she
does
man
work
over
a
man
name
has
the
will
of
any
ten
men
i
ever
knew
and
i
mind
telling
you
that
i
fear
her
more
than
any
person
on
god
earth
i
broke
with
her
once
said
raffles
grimly
but
i
know
her
if
i
had
been
asked
to
name
the
one
person
in
london
by
whom
i
was
keenest
not
to
be
bowled
out
i
should
have
named
jacques
saillard
that
he
had
never
before
named
her
to
me
was
as
characteristic
as
the
reticence
with
which
raffles
spoke
of
their
past
relations
and
even
of
their
conversation
in
the
back
that
evening
it
was
a
question
of
principle
with
him
and
one
that
i
like
to
remember
never
give
a
woman
away
bunny
he
used
to
say
and
he
said
it
again
but
with
a
heavy
cloud
upon
him
as
though
his
chivalry
was
sorely
tried
that
all
right
said
i
if
you
not
going
to
be
given
away
yourself
that
just
it
bunny
that
just
the
words
were
out
of
him
it
was
too
late
to
recall
them
i
had
hit
the
nail
upon
the
head
so
she
threatened
you
i
said
did
she
i
did
say
so
he
replied
coldly
and
she
is
mated
with
a
clown
i
pursued
how
she
ever
married
him
he
admitted
is
a
mystery
to
me
it
always
is
said
i
the
wise
man
for
once
and
rather
enjoying
the
role
southern
blood
spanish
she
be
pestering
you
to
run
off
with
her
old
chap
said
raffles
was
pacing
the
room
he
stopped
in
his
stride
for
half
a
second
so
she
had
begun
pestering
him
already
it
is
wonderful
how
acute
any
fool
can
be
in
the
affairs
of
his
friend
but
raffles
resumed
his
walk
without
a
syllable
and
i
retreated
to
safer
ground
so
you
sent
her
to
earl
court
i
mused
aloud
and
at
last
he
smiled
you
be
interested
to
hear
bunny
said
he
that
i
am
now
living
in
seven
dials
and
bill
sikes
could
hold
a
farthing
dip
to
me
bless
you
she
had
my
old
police
record
at
her
fingers
ends
but
it
was
fit
to
frame
compared
with
the
one
i
gave
her
i
had
sunk
as
low
as
they
dig
i
divided
my
nights
between
the
open
parks
and
a
kitchen
in
seven
dials
if
i
was
decently
dressed
it
was
because
i
had
stolen
the
suit
down
the
thames
valley
beat
the
night
before
last
i
was
on
my
way
back
when
first
that
sleepy
square
and
then
her
open
window
proved
too
much
for
me
you
should
have
heard
me
beg
her
to
let
me
push
on
to
the
devil
in
my
own
way
there
i
spread
myself
for
i
meant
every
word
but
i
swore
the
final
stage
would
be
a
drop
you
did
lay
it
on
said
i
it
was
necessary
and
that
had
its
effect
she
let
me
go
but
at
the
last
moment
she
said
she
did
believe
i
was
so
black
as
i
painted
myself
and
then
there
was
the
balcony
scene
you
missed
so
that
was
all
i
could
not
help
telling
him
that
he
had
got
out
of
it
better
than
he
deserved
for
ever
getting
in
next
moment
i
regretted
the
remark
if
i
have
got
out
of
it
said
raffles
doubtfully
we
are
dreadfully
near
neighbors
and
i
ca
move
in
a
minute
with
old
theobald
taking
a
grave
view
of
my
case
i
suppose
i
had
better
lie
low
and
thank
the
gods
again
for
putting
her
off
the
scent
for
the
time
being
no
doubt
our
conversation
was
carried
beyond
this
point
but
it
certainly
was
not
many
minutes
later
nor
had
we
left
the
subject
when
the
electric
bell
thrilled
us
both
to
a
sudden
silence
the
doctor
i
queried
hope
fighting
with
my
horror
it
was
a
single
ring
the
last
post
you
know
he
knocks
and
it
long
past
his
time
the
electric
bell
rang
again
but
now
as
though
it
never
would
stop
you
go
bunny
said
raffles
with
decision
his
eyes
were
sparkling
his
smile
was
firm
what
am
i
to
say
if
it
the
lady
let
her
in
it
was
the
lady
still
in
her
evening
cloak
with
her
fine
dark
head
by
the
hood
and
an
engaging
contempt
of
appearances
upon
her
angry
face
she
was
even
handsomer
than
i
had
thought
and
her
beauty
of
a
bolder
type
but
she
was
also
angrier
than
i
had
anticipated
when
i
came
so
readily
to
the
door
the
passage
into
which
it
opened
was
an
exceedingly
narrow
one
as
i
have
often
said
but
i
never
dreamt
of
barring
this
woman
way
though
not
a
word
did
she
stoop
to
say
to
me
i
was
only
too
glad
to
flatten
myself
against
the
wall
as
the
rustling
fury
strode
past
me
into
the
lighted
room
with
the
open
door
so
this
is
your
thieves
kitchen
she
cried
in
scorn
i
was
on
the
threshold
myself
and
raffles
glanced
towards
me
with
raised
eyebrows
i
have
certainly
had
better
quarters
in
my
day
said
he
but
you
need
not
call
them
absurd
names
before
my
man
then
send
your
about
his
business
said
jacques
saillard
with
an
unpleasant
stress
upon
the
word
indicated
but
when
the
door
was
shut
i
heard
raffles
assuring
her
that
i
knew
nothing
that
he
was
a
real
invalid
overcome
by
a
sudden
mad
temptation
and
all
he
had
told
her
of
his
life
a
lie
to
hide
his
whereabouts
but
all
he
was
telling
her
now
she
could
prove
for
herself
without
leaving
that
building
it
seemed
however
that
she
had
proved
it
already
by
going
first
to
the
porter
below
stairs
yet
i
do
not
think
she
cared
one
atom
which
story
was
the
truth
so
you
thought
i
could
pass
you
in
your
chair
she
said
or
ever
in
this
world
again
without
hearing
from
my
heart
that
it
was
you
ii
bunny
said
raffles
i
awfully
sorry
old
chap
but
you
got
to
go
it
was
some
weeks
since
the
first
untimely
visitation
of
jacques
saillard
but
there
had
been
many
others
at
all
hours
of
the
day
while
raffles
had
been
induced
to
pay
at
least
one
to
her
studio
in
the
neighboring
square
these
intrusions
he
had
endured
at
first
with
an
air
of
humorous
resignation
which
imposed
upon
me
less
than
he
imagined
the
woman
meant
well
he
said
after
all
and
could
be
trusted
to
keep
his
secret
loyally
it
was
plain
to
me
however
that
raffles
did
not
trust
her
and
that
his
pretence
upon
the
point
was
a
deliberate
pose
to
conceal
the
extent
to
which
she
had
him
in
her
power
otherwise
there
would
have
been
little
point
in
hiding
anything
from
the
one
person
in
possession
of
the
cardinal
secret
of
his
identity
but
raffles
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
hoodwink
jacques
saillard
in
the
subsidiary
matter
of
his
health
in
which
theobald
lent
him
unwitting
assistance
and
as
we
have
seen
to
impress
upon
her
that
i
was
actually
his
attendant
and
as
ignorant
of
his
past
as
the
doctor
himself
so
you
all
right
bunny
he
had
assured
me
she
thinks
you
knew
nothing
the
other
night
i
told
you
she
was
a
clever
woman
outside
her
work
but
has
she
a
will
i
told
raffles
it
was
very
considerate
of
him
to
keep
me
out
of
it
but
that
it
seemed
to
me
like
tying
up
the
bag
when
the
cat
had
escaped
his
reply
was
an
admission
that
one
must
be
on
the
defensive
with
such
a
woman
and
in
such
a
case
soon
after
this
raffles
looking
far
from
well
fell
back
upon
his
own
last
line
of
defence
namely
his
bed
and
now
as
always
in
the
end
i
could
see
some
sense
in
his
subtleties
since
it
was
comparatively
easy
for
me
to
turn
even
jacques
saillard
from
the
door
with
theobald
explicit
injunctions
and
with
my
own
honesty
unquestioned
so
for
a
day
we
had
peace
once
more
then
came
letters
then
the
doctor
again
and
again
and
finally
my
dismissal
in
the
incredible
words
which
have
necessitated
these
explanations
go
i
echoed
go
where
it
that
ass
theobald
said
raffles
he
insists
on
my
going
altogether
he
nodded
and
you
mean
to
let
him
have
his
way
i
had
no
language
for
my
mortification
and
disgust
though
neither
was
as
yet
quite
so
great
as
my
surprise
i
had
foreseen
almost
every
conceivable
consequence
of
the
mad
act
which
brought
all
this
trouble
to
pass
but
a
voluntary
division
between
raffles
and
me
had
certainly
never
entered
my
calculations
nor
could
i
think
that
it
had
occurred
to
him
before
our
egregious
doctor
last
visit
this
very
morning
raffles
had
looked
irritated
as
he
broke
the
news
to
me
from
his
pillow
and
now
there
was
some
sympathy
in
the
way
he
sat
up
in
bed
as
though
he
felt
the
thing
himself
i
am
obliged
to
give
in
to
the
fellow
said
he
he
saving
me
from
my
friend
and
i
bound
to
humor
him
but
i
can
tell
you
that
been
arguing
about
you
for
the
last
half
hour
bunny
it
was
no
use
the
idiot
has
had
his
knife
in
you
from
the
first
and
he
would
see
me
through
on
any
other
conditions
so
he
is
going
to
see
you
through
is
he
it
tots
up
to
that
said
raffles
looking
at
me
rather
hard
at
all
events
he
has
come
to
my
rescue
for
the
time
being
and
it
for
me
to
manage
the
rest
you
do
know
what
it
has
been
bunny
these
last
few
weeks
and
gallantry
forbids
that
i
should
tell
you
even
now
but
would
you
rather
elope
against
your
will
or
have
your
continued
existence
made
known
to
the
world
in
general
and
the
police
in
particular
that
is
practically
the
problem
which
i
have
had
to
solve
and
the
temporary
solution
was
to
fall
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
ill
and
now
what
do
you
think
i
owe
it
to
you
to
tell
you
bunny
though
it
goes
against
the
grain
she
would
take
me
the
dear
warm
underworld
where
the
sun
really
shines
and
she
would
me
back
to
life
and
love
the
artistic
temperament
is
a
fearsome
thing
bunny
in
a
woman
with
the
devil
own
will
raffles
tore
up
the
letter
from
which
he
had
read
these
piquant
extracts
and
lay
back
on
the
pillows
with
the
tired
air
of
the
veritable
invalid
which
he
seemed
able
to
assume
at
will
but
for
once
he
did
look
as
though
bed
was
the
best
place
for
him
and
i
used
the
fact
as
an
argument
for
my
own
retention
in
defiance
of
theobald
the
town
was
full
of
typhoid
i
said
and
certainly
that
autumnal
scourge
was
in
the
air
did
he
want
me
to
leave
him
at
the
very
moment
when
he
might
be
sickening
for
a
serious
illness
you
know
i
do
my
good
fellow
said
raffles
wearily
but
theobald
does
and
i
ca
afford
to
go
against
him
now
not
that
i
really
care
what
happens
to
me
now
that
that
woman
knows
i
in
the
land
of
the
living
she
let
it
out
to
a
dead
certainty
and
at
the
best
there
be
a
hue
and
cry
which
is
the
very
thing
i
have
escaped
all
these
years
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
and
take
some
quiet
place
somewhere
and
then
let
me
know
so
that
i
may
have
a
port
in
the
storm
when
it
breaks
now
you
talking
i
cried
recovering
my
spirits
i
thought
you
meant
to
go
and
drop
a
fellow
altogether
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
you
would
think
rejoined
raffles
with
a
contempt
that
was
welcome
enough
after
my
late
alarm
no
my
dear
rabbit
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
make
a
new
burrow
for
us
both
try
down
the
thames
in
some
quiet
nook
that
a
literary
man
would
naturally
select
i
often
thought
that
more
use
might
be
made
of
a
boat
while
the
family
are
at
dinner
than
there
ever
has
been
yet
if
raffles
is
to
come
to
life
old
chap
he
shall
go
for
all
he
worth
there
something
to
be
done
with
a
bicycle
too
try
ham
common
or
roehampton
or
some
such
sleepy
hollow
a
trifle
off
the
line
and
say
you
expecting
your
brother
from
the
colonies
into
this
arrangement
i
entered
without
the
slightest
hesitation
for
we
had
funds
enough
to
carry
it
out
on
a
comfortable
scale
and
raffles
placed
a
sufficient
share
at
my
disposal
for
the
nonce
moreover
i
for
one
was
only
too
glad
to
seek
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
a
phrase
which
i
determined
to
interpret
literally
in
my
choice
of
fresh
surroundings
i
was
tired
of
our
submerged
life
in
the
poky
little
flat
especially
now
that
we
had
money
enough
for
better
things
i
myself
of
late
had
dark
dealings
with
the
receivers
with
the
result
that
poor
lord
ernest
belville
successes
were
now
indeed
ours
subsequent
complications
had
been
the
more
galling
on
that
account
while
the
wanton
way
in
which
they
had
been
created
was
the
most
irritating
reflection
of
all
but
it
had
brought
its
own
punishment
upon
raffles
and
i
fancied
the
lesson
would
prove
salutary
when
we
again
settled
down
if
ever
we
do
bunny
said
he
as
i
took
his
hand
and
told
him
how
i
was
already
looking
forward
to
the
time
but
of
course
we
will
i
cried
concealing
the
resentment
at
leaving
him
which
his
tone
and
his
appearance
renewed
in
my
breast
i
not
so
sure
of
it
he
said
gloomily
i
in
clutches
and
i
got
to
get
out
of
them
first
i
sit
tight
until
you
do
well
he
said
if
you
do
see
me
in
ten
days
you
never
will
only
ten
days
i
echoed
that
nothing
at
all
a
lot
may
happen
in
ten
days
replied
raffles
in
the
same
depressing
tone
so
very
depressing
in
him
and
with
that
he
held
out
his
hand
a
second
time
and
dropped
mine
suddenly
after
as
sudden
a
pressure
for
farewell
i
left
the
flat
in
considerable
dejection
after
all
unable
to
decide
whether
raffles
was
really
ill
or
only
worried
as
i
knew
him
to
be
and
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
author
of
my
dismissal
that
confounded
theobald
flung
open
his
door
and
waylaid
me
are
you
going
he
demanded
the
traps
in
my
hands
proclaimed
that
i
was
but
i
dropped
them
at
his
feet
to
have
it
out
with
him
then
and
there
yes
i
answered
fiercely
thanks
to
you
well
my
good
fellow
he
said
his
face
lightening
and
softening
at
the
same
time
as
though
a
load
were
off
his
mind
no
pleasure
to
me
to
deprive
any
man
of
his
billet
but
you
never
were
a
nurse
and
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
i
began
to
wonder
what
he
meant
and
how
much
he
did
know
and
my
speculations
kept
me
silent
but
come
in
here
a
moment
he
continued
just
as
i
decided
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
and
leading
me
into
his
minute
theobald
solemnly
presented
me
with
a
sovereign
by
way
of
compensation
which
i
pocketed
as
solemnly
and
with
as
much
gratitude
as
if
i
had
not
fifty
of
them
distributed
over
my
person
as
it
was
the
good
fellow
had
quite
forgotten
my
social
status
about
which
he
himself
had
been
so
particular
at
our
earliest
interview
but
he
had
never
accustomed
himself
to
treat
me
as
a
gentleman
and
i
do
not
suppose
he
had
been
improving
his
memory
by
the
tall
tumbler
which
i
saw
him
poke
behind
a
photograph
as
we
entered
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
know
before
i
go
said
i
turning
suddenly
on
the
doctor
mat
and
that
is
whether
maturin
is
really
ill
or
not
i
meant
of
course
at
the
present
moment
but
theobald
braced
himself
like
a
recruit
at
the
voice
of
course
he
is
he
snapped
so
ill
as
to
need
a
nurse
who
can
nurse
by
way
of
a
change
with
that
his
door
shut
in
my
face
and
i
had
to
go
my
way
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
he
had
mistaken
my
meaning
and
was
telling
me
a
lie
or
not
but
for
my
misgivings
upon
this
point
i
might
have
extracted
some
very
genuine
enjoyment
out
of
the
next
few
days
i
had
decent
clothes
to
my
back
with
money
as
i
say
in
most
of
the
pockets
and
more
freedom
to
spend
it
than
was
possible
in
the
constant
society
of
a
man
whose
personal
liberty
depended
on
a
universal
supposition
that
he
was
dead
raffles
was
as
bold
as
ever
and
i
as
fond
of
him
but
whereas
he
would
run
any
risk
in
a
professional
exploit
there
were
many
innocent
recreations
still
open
to
me
which
would
have
been
sheer
madness
in
him
he
could
not
even
watch
a
match
from
the
sixpenny
seats
at
lord
where
the
gentlemen
were
every
year
in
a
worse
way
without
him
he
never
travelled
by
rail
and
dining
out
was
a
risk
only
to
be
run
with
some
ulterior
object
in
view
in
fact
much
as
it
had
changed
raffles
could
no
longer
show
his
face
with
perfect
impunity
in
any
quarter
or
at
any
hour
moreover
after
the
lesson
he
had
now
learnt
i
foresaw
increased
caution
on
his
part
in
this
respect
but
i
myself
was
under
no
such
perpetual
disadvantage
and
while
what
was
good
enough
for
raffles
was
quite
good
enough
for
me
so
long
as
we
were
together
i
saw
no
harm
in
profiting
by
the
present
opportunity
of
doing
well
such
were
my
reflections
on
the
way
to
richmond
in
a
hansom
cab
richmond
had
struck
us
both
as
the
best
centre
of
operations
in
search
of
the
suburban
retreat
which
raffles
wanted
and
by
road
in
a
hansom
was
certainly
the
most
agreeable
way
of
getting
there
in
a
week
or
ten
days
raffles
was
to
write
to
me
at
the
richmond
but
for
at
least
a
week
i
should
be
on
my
own
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
sensation
as
i
leant
back
in
the
comfortable
hansom
and
rather
to
one
side
in
order
to
have
a
good
look
at
myself
in
the
bevelled
mirror
that
is
almost
as
great
an
improvement
in
these
vehicles
as
the
rubber
tires
really
i
was
not
an
youth
if
one
may
call
one
self
such
at
the
age
of
thirty
i
could
lay
no
claim
either
to
the
striking
cast
of
countenance
or
to
the
peculiar
charm
of
expression
which
made
the
face
of
raffles
like
no
other
in
the
world
but
this
very
distinction
was
in
itself
a
danger
for
its
impression
was
indelible
whereas
i
might
still
have
been
mistaken
for
a
hundred
other
young
fellows
at
large
in
london
incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
the
moralists
i
had
sustained
no
external
hallmark
by
my
term
of
imprisonment
and
i
am
vain
enough
to
believe
that
the
evil
which
i
did
had
not
a
separate
existence
in
my
face
this
afternoon
indeed
i
was
struck
by
the
purity
of
my
fresh
complexion
and
rather
depressed
by
the
general
innocence
of
the
visage
which
peered
into
mine
from
the
little
mirror
my
moustache
grown
in
the
flat
after
a
protracted
holiday
again
preserved
the
most
disappointing
dimensions
and
was
still
invisible
in
certain
lights
without
wax
so
far
from
discerning
the
desperate
criminal
who
has
done
time
once
and
deserved
it
over
and
over
again
the
superior
but
superficial
observer
might
have
imagined
that
he
detected
a
certain
element
of
folly
in
my
face
at
all
events
it
was
not
the
face
to
shut
the
doors
of
a
hotel
against
me
without
accidental
evidence
of
a
more
explicit
kind
and
it
was
with
no
little
satisfaction
that
i
directed
the
man
to
drive
to
the
star
and
garter
i
also
told
him
to
go
through
richmond
park
though
he
warned
me
that
it
would
add
considerably
to
the
distance
and
his
fare
it
was
autumn
and
it
struck
me
that
the
tints
would
be
fine
and
i
had
learnt
from
raffles
to
appreciate
such
things
even
amid
the
excitement
of
an
audacious
enterprise
if
i
dwell
upon
my
appreciation
of
this
occasion
it
is
because
like
most
pleasures
it
was
exceedingly
i
was
very
comfortable
at
the
star
and
garter
which
was
so
empty
that
i
had
a
room
worthy
of
a
prince
where
i
could
enjoy
the
finest
of
all
views
in
patriotic
opinion
every
morning
while
i
shaved
i
walked
many
miles
through
the
noble
park
over
the
commons
of
ham
and
wimbledon
and
one
day
as
far
as
that
of
esher
where
i
was
forcibly
reminded
of
a
service
we
once
rendered
to
a
distinguished
resident
in
this
delightful
locality
but
it
was
on
ham
common
one
of
the
places
which
raffles
had
mentioned
as
specially
desirable
that
i
actually
found
an
almost
ideal
retreat
this
was
a
cottage
where
i
heard
on
inquiry
that
rooms
were
to
be
let
in
the
summer
the
landlady
a
motherly
body
of
visible
excellence
was
surprised
indeed
at
receiving
an
application
for
the
winter
months
but
i
have
generally
found
that
the
title
of
author
claimed
with
an
air
explains
every
little
innocent
irregularity
of
conduct
or
appearance
and
even
requires
something
of
the
kind
to
carry
conviction
to
the
lay
intelligence
the
present
case
was
one
in
point
and
when
i
said
that
i
could
only
write
in
a
room
facing
north
on
mutton
chops
and
milk
with
a
cold
ham
in
the
wardrobe
in
case
of
nocturnal
inspiration
to
which
i
was
liable
my
literary
character
was
established
beyond
dispute
i
secured
the
rooms
paid
a
month
rent
in
advance
at
my
own
request
and
moped
in
them
dreadfully
until
the
week
was
up
and
raffles
due
any
day
i
explained
that
the
inspiration
would
not
come
and
asked
abruptly
if
the
mutton
was
new
zealand
thrice
had
i
made
fruitless
inquiries
at
the
richmond
but
on
the
tenth
day
i
was
in
and
out
almost
every
hour
not
a
word
was
there
for
me
up
to
the
last
post
at
night
home
i
trudged
to
ham
with
horrible
forebodings
and
back
again
to
richmond
after
breakfast
next
morning
still
there
was
nothing
i
could
bear
it
no
more
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
i
was
climbing
the
station
stairs
at
earl
court
it
was
a
wretched
morning
there
a
weeping
mist
shrouding
the
long
straight
street
and
clinging
to
one
face
in
clammy
caresses
i
felt
how
much
better
it
was
down
at
ham
as
i
turned
into
our
side
street
and
saw
the
flats
looming
like
mountains
the
hidden
in
the
mist
at
our
entrance
stood
a
nebulous
conveyance
that
i
took
at
first
for
a
tradesman
van
to
my
horror
it
proved
to
be
a
hearse
and
all
at
once
the
white
breath
ceased
upon
my
lips
i
had
looked
up
at
our
windows
and
the
blinds
were
down
i
rushed
within
the
doctor
door
stood
open
i
neither
knocked
nor
rang
but
found
him
in
his
with
red
eyes
and
a
blotchy
face
otherwise
he
was
in
solemn
black
from
head
to
heel
who
is
dead
i
burst
out
who
is
dead
the
red
eyes
looked
redder
than
ever
as
theobald
opened
them
at
the
unwarrantable
sight
of
me
and
he
was
terribly
slow
in
answering
but
in
the
end
he
did
answer
and
did
not
kick
me
out
as
he
evidently
had
a
mind
maturin
he
said
and
sighed
like
a
beaten
man
i
said
nothing
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
i
had
known
it
all
these
minutes
nay
i
had
dreaded
this
from
the
first
had
divined
it
at
the
last
though
to
the
last
also
i
had
refused
to
entertain
my
own
conviction
raffles
dead
a
real
invalid
after
all
raffles
dead
and
on
the
point
of
burial
what
did
he
die
of
i
asked
unconsciously
drawing
on
that
fund
of
grim
which
the
weakest
of
us
seem
to
hold
in
reserve
for
real
calamity
typhoid
he
answered
kensington
is
full
of
it
he
was
sickening
for
it
when
i
left
and
you
knew
it
and
could
get
rid
of
me
then
my
good
fellow
i
was
obliged
to
have
a
more
experienced
nurse
for
that
very
reason
the
doctor
tone
was
so
conciliatory
that
i
remembered
in
an
instant
what
a
humbug
the
man
was
and
became
suddenly
possessed
with
the
vague
conviction
that
he
was
imposing
upon
me
now
are
you
sure
it
was
typhoid
at
all
i
cried
fiercely
to
his
face
are
you
sure
it
was
suicide
or
murder
i
confess
that
i
can
see
little
point
in
this
speech
as
i
write
it
down
but
it
was
what
i
said
in
a
burst
of
grief
and
of
wild
suspicion
nor
was
it
without
effect
upon
theobald
who
turned
bright
scarlet
from
his
hair
to
his
immaculate
collar
do
you
want
me
to
throw
you
out
into
the
street
he
cried
and
all
at
once
i
remembered
that
i
had
come
to
raffles
as
a
perfect
stranger
and
for
his
sake
might
as
well
preserve
that
character
to
the
last
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
brokenly
he
was
so
good
to
me
i
became
so
attached
to
him
you
forget
i
am
originally
of
his
class
i
did
forget
it
replied
theobald
looking
relieved
at
my
new
tone
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
doing
so
hush
they
are
bringing
him
down
i
must
have
a
drink
before
we
start
and
you
better
join
me
there
was
no
pretence
about
his
drink
this
time
and
a
pretty
stiff
one
it
was
but
i
fancy
my
own
must
have
run
it
hard
in
my
case
it
cast
a
merciful
haze
over
much
of
the
next
hour
which
i
can
truthfully
describe
as
one
of
the
most
painful
of
my
whole
existence
i
can
have
known
very
little
of
what
i
was
doing
i
only
remember
finding
myself
in
a
hansom
suddenly
wondering
why
it
was
going
so
slowly
and
once
more
awaking
to
the
truth
but
it
was
to
the
truth
itself
more
than
to
the
liquor
that
i
must
have
owed
my
dazed
condition
my
next
recollection
is
of
looking
down
into
the
open
grave
in
a
sudden
passionate
anxiety
to
see
the
name
for
myself
it
was
not
the
name
of
my
friend
of
course
but
it
was
the
one
under
which
he
had
passed
for
many
months
i
was
still
stupefied
by
a
sense
of
inconceivable
loss
and
had
not
raised
my
eyes
from
that
which
was
slowly
forcing
me
to
realize
what
had
happened
when
there
was
a
rustle
at
my
elbow
and
a
shower
of
hothouse
flowers
passed
before
them
falling
like
huge
snowflakes
where
my
gaze
had
rested
i
looked
up
and
at
my
side
stood
a
majestic
figure
in
deep
mourning
the
face
was
carefully
veiled
but
i
was
too
close
not
to
recognize
the
masterful
beauty
whom
the
world
knew
as
jacques
saillard
i
had
no
sympathy
with
her
on
the
contrary
my
blood
boiled
with
the
vague
conviction
that
in
some
way
she
was
responsible
for
this
death
yet
she
was
the
only
woman
present
there
were
not
a
half
a
dozen
of
us
altogether
and
her
flowers
were
the
only
flowers
the
melancholy
ceremony
was
over
and
jacques
saillard
had
departed
in
a
funeral
brougham
evidently
hired
for
the
occasion
i
had
watched
her
drive
away
and
the
sight
of
my
own
cabman
making
signs
to
me
through
the
fog
had
suddenly
reminded
me
that
i
had
bidden
him
to
wait
i
was
the
last
to
leave
and
had
turned
my
back
upon
the
already
at
their
final
task
when
a
hand
fell
lightly
but
firmly
upon
my
shoulder
i
do
want
to
make
a
scene
in
a
cemetery
said
a
voice
in
a
not
unkindly
almost
confidential
whisper
will
you
get
into
your
own
cab
and
come
quietly
who
on
earth
are
you
i
exclaimed
i
now
remembered
having
seen
the
fellow
hovering
about
during
the
funeral
and
subconsciously
taking
him
for
the
undertaker
head
man
he
had
certainly
that
appearance
and
even
now
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
was
anything
else
my
name
wo
help
you
he
said
pityingly
but
you
will
guess
where
i
come
from
when
i
tell
you
i
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
my
sensations
at
this
announcement
may
not
be
believed
but
i
solemnly
declare
that
i
have
seldom
experienced
so
fierce
a
satisfaction
here
was
a
new
excitement
in
which
to
drown
my
grief
here
was
something
to
think
about
and
i
should
be
spared
the
intolerable
experience
of
a
solitary
return
to
the
little
place
at
ham
it
was
as
though
i
had
lost
a
limb
and
some
one
had
struck
me
so
hard
in
the
face
that
the
greater
agony
was
forgotten
i
got
into
the
hansom
without
a
word
my
captor
following
at
my
heels
and
giving
his
own
directions
to
the
cabman
before
taking
his
seat
the
word
station
was
the
only
one
i
caught
and
i
wondered
whether
it
was
to
be
bow
street
again
my
companion
next
words
however
or
rather
the
tone
in
which
he
uttered
them
destroyed
my
capacity
for
idle
speculation
mr
maturin
said
he
maturin
indeed
well
said
i
what
about
him
do
you
think
we
do
know
who
he
was
who
was
he
i
asked
defiantly
you
ought
to
know
said
he
you
got
locked
up
through
him
the
other
time
too
his
favorite
name
was
raffles
then
it
was
his
real
name
i
said
indignantly
and
he
has
been
dead
for
years
my
captor
simply
chuckled
he
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
tell
you
but
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
told
him
with
such
spirit
for
what
could
it
matter
to
raffles
now
i
did
not
think
instinct
was
still
stronger
than
reason
and
fresh
from
his
funeral
i
had
taken
up
the
cudgels
for
my
dead
friend
as
though
he
were
still
alive
next
moment
i
saw
this
for
myself
and
my
tears
came
nearer
the
surface
than
they
had
been
yet
but
the
fellow
at
my
side
laughed
outright
shall
i
tell
you
something
else
said
he
as
you
like
he
not
even
at
the
bottom
of
that
grave
he
no
more
dead
than
you
or
i
and
a
sham
burial
is
his
latest
piece
of
villainy
i
doubt
whether
i
could
have
spoken
if
i
had
tried
i
did
not
try
i
had
no
use
for
speech
i
did
not
even
ask
him
if
he
was
sure
i
was
so
sure
myself
it
was
all
as
plain
to
me
as
riddles
usually
are
when
one
has
the
answer
the
doctor
alarms
his
unscrupulous
venality
the
simulated
illness
my
own
dismissal
each
fitted
in
its
obvious
place
and
not
even
the
last
had
power
as
yet
to
mar
my
joy
in
the
one
central
fact
to
which
all
the
rest
were
as
tapers
to
the
sun
he
is
alive
i
cried
nothing
else
matters
he
is
alive
at
last
i
did
ask
whether
they
had
got
him
too
but
thankful
as
i
was
for
the
greater
knowledge
i
confess
that
i
did
not
much
care
what
answer
i
received
already
i
was
figuring
out
how
much
we
might
each
get
and
how
old
we
should
be
when
we
came
out
but
my
companion
tilted
his
hat
to
the
back
of
his
head
at
the
same
time
putting
his
face
close
to
mine
and
compelling
my
scrutiny
and
my
answer
as
you
have
already
guessed
was
the
face
of
raffles
himself
superbly
disguised
but
less
superbly
than
his
voice
and
yet
so
thinly
that
i
should
have
known
him
in
a
trice
had
i
not
been
too
miserable
in
the
beginning
to
give
him
a
second
glance
jacques
saillard
had
made
his
life
impossible
and
this
was
the
one
escape
raffles
had
bought
the
doctor
for
a
thousand
pounds
and
the
doctor
had
bought
a
nurse
of
his
own
kidney
on
his
own
account
me
for
some
reason
he
would
not
trust
he
had
insisted
upon
my
dismissal
as
an
essential
preliminary
to
his
part
in
the
conspiracy
here
the
details
were
each
in
turn
as
raffles
told
me
the
story
at
one
period
he
had
been
very
daringly
drugged
indeed
and
in
his
own
words
as
dead
as
a
man
need
be
but
he
had
left
strict
instructions
that
nobody
but
the
nurse
and
my
devoted
physician
should
lay
a
finger
on
me
afterwards
and
by
virtue
of
this
proviso
a
library
of
books
largely
acquired
for
the
occasion
had
been
impiously
interred
at
kensal
green
raffles
had
definitely
undertaken
not
to
trust
me
with
the
secret
and
but
for
my
untoward
appearance
at
the
funeral
which
he
had
attended
for
his
own
final
satisfaction
i
was
assured
and
am
convinced
that
he
would
have
kept
his
promise
to
the
letter
in
explaining
this
he
gave
me
the
one
explanation
i
desired
and
in
another
moment
we
turned
into
praed
street
paddington
and
i
thought
you
said
bow
street
said
i
are
you
coming
straight
down
to
richmond
with
me
i
may
as
well
said
raffles
though
i
did
mean
to
get
my
kit
first
so
as
to
start
in
fair
and
square
as
the
brother
from
the
bush
that
why
i
had
written
the
function
was
a
day
later
than
i
calculated
i
was
going
to
write
but
what
are
we
to
do
said
i
hesitating
when
he
had
paid
the
cab
i
have
been
playing
the
colonies
for
all
they
are
worth
oh
i
lost
my
luggage
said
he
or
a
wave
came
into
my
cabin
and
spoilt
every
stitch
or
i
had
nothing
fit
to
bring
ashore
settle
that
in
the
train
the
wrong
house
my
brother
ralph
who
now
lived
with
me
on
the
edge
of
ham
common
had
come
home
from
australia
with
a
curious
affection
of
the
eyes
due
to
long
exposure
to
the
glare
out
there
and
necessitating
the
use
of
clouded
spectacles
in
the
open
air
he
had
not
the
rich
complexion
of
the
typical
colonist
being
indeed
peculiarly
pale
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
confined
to
his
berth
for
the
greater
part
of
the
voyage
while
his
prematurely
gray
hair
was
sufficient
proof
that
the
rigors
of
bush
life
had
at
last
undermined
an
originally
tough
constitution
our
landlady
who
spoilt
my
brother
from
the
first
was
much
concerned
on
his
behalf
and
wished
to
call
in
the
local
doctor
but
ralph
said
dreadful
things
about
the
profession
and
quite
frightened
the
good
woman
by
arbitrarily
forbidding
her
ever
to
let
a
doctor
inside
her
door
i
had
to
apologize
to
her
for
the
painful
prejudices
and
violent
language
of
these
colonists
but
the
old
soul
was
easily
mollified
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
my
brother
at
first
sight
and
she
never
could
do
too
much
for
him
it
was
owing
to
our
landlady
that
i
took
to
calling
him
ralph
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
on
her
beginning
to
speak
of
and
to
him
as
mr
raffles
this
wo
do
said
he
to
me
it
a
name
that
sticks
it
must
be
my
fault
she
must
have
heard
it
from
me
said
i
you
must
tell
her
it
the
short
for
ralph
but
it
longer
it
the
short
said
he
and
you
got
to
tell
her
so
henceforth
i
heard
as
much
of
ralph
his
likes
and
dislikes
what
he
would
fancy
and
what
he
would
not
and
oh
what
a
dear
gentleman
he
was
that
i
often
remembered
to
say
ralph
old
chap
myself
it
was
an
ideal
cottage
as
i
said
when
i
found
it
and
in
it
our
delicate
man
became
rapidly
robust
not
that
the
air
was
also
ideal
for
when
it
was
not
raining
we
had
the
same
faithful
mist
from
november
to
march
but
it
was
something
to
ralph
to
get
any
air
at
all
other
than
and
the
bicycle
did
the
rest
we
taught
ourselves
and
may
i
never
forget
our
earlier
rides
through
and
through
richmond
park
when
the
afternoons
were
shortest
upon
the
incomparable
ripley
road
when
we
gave
a
day
to
it
raffles
rode
a
beeston
humber
a
royal
sunbeam
was
good
enough
for
me
but
he
insisted
on
our
both
having
dunlop
tires
they
seem
the
most
popular
brand
i
had
my
eye
on
the
road
all
the
way
from
ripley
to
cobham
and
there
were
more
dunlop
marks
than
any
other
kind
bless
you
yes
they
all
leave
their
special
tracks
and
we
do
want
ours
to
be
extra
special
the
dunlop
like
a
rattlesnake
and
the
palmer
leaves
but
surely
the
serpent
is
more
in
our
line
that
was
the
winter
when
there
were
so
many
burglaries
in
the
thames
valley
from
richmond
upward
it
was
said
that
the
thieves
used
bicycles
in
every
case
but
what
is
not
said
they
were
sometimes
on
foot
to
my
knowledge
and
we
took
a
great
interest
in
the
series
or
rather
sequence
of
successful
crimes
raffles
would
often
get
his
devoted
old
lady
to
read
him
the
latest
local
accounts
while
i
was
busy
with
my
writing
much
i
wrote
in
my
own
room
we
even
rode
out
by
night
ourselves
to
see
if
we
could
not
get
on
the
tracks
of
the
thieves
and
never
did
we
fail
to
find
hot
coffee
on
the
hob
for
our
return
we
had
indeed
fallen
upon
our
feet
also
the
misty
nights
might
have
been
made
for
the
thieves
but
their
success
was
not
so
consistent
and
never
so
enormous
as
people
said
especially
the
sufferers
who
lost
more
valuables
than
they
had
ever
been
known
to
possess
failure
was
often
the
caitiff
portion
and
disaster
once
owing
ironically
enough
to
that
very
mist
which
should
have
served
them
but
as
i
am
going
to
tell
the
story
with
some
particularity
and
perhaps
some
gusto
you
will
see
why
who
read
the
right
house
stood
on
high
ground
near
the
river
with
quite
a
drive
in
at
one
gate
and
out
at
the
other
sweeping
past
the
steps
between
the
two
gates
was
a
of
shrubs
to
the
left
of
the
steps
a
conservatory
and
to
their
right
the
walk
leading
to
the
entrance
and
the
back
premises
here
also
was
the
pantry
window
of
which
more
anon
the
right
house
was
the
residence
of
an
opulent
stockbroker
who
wore
a
heavy
and
seemed
fair
game
there
would
have
been
two
objections
to
it
had
i
been
the
stockbroker
the
house
was
one
of
a
row
though
a
goodly
row
and
an
had
established
himself
next
door
there
is
a
type
of
such
institutions
in
the
suburbs
the
youths
go
about
in
knickerbockers
smoking
pipes
except
on
saturday
nights
when
they
lead
each
other
home
from
the
last
train
it
was
none
of
our
business
to
spy
upon
these
boys
but
their
manners
and
customs
fell
within
the
field
of
observation
and
we
did
not
choose
the
night
upon
which
the
whole
row
was
likely
to
be
kept
awake
the
night
that
we
did
choose
was
as
misty
as
even
the
thames
valley
is
capable
of
making
them
raffles
smeared
vaseline
upon
the
plated
parts
of
his
beeston
humber
before
starting
and
our
dear
landlady
cosseted
us
both
and
prayed
we
might
see
nothing
of
the
nasty
burglars
not
denying
as
the
reward
would
be
very
handy
to
them
that
got
it
to
say
nothing
of
the
honor
and
glory
we
had
promised
her
a
liberal
perquisite
in
the
event
of
our
success
but
she
must
not
give
other
cyclists
our
idea
by
mentioning
it
to
a
soul
it
was
about
midnight
when
we
cycled
through
kingston
to
surbiton
having
trundled
our
machines
across
ham
fields
mournful
in
the
mist
as
those
by
acheron
and
so
over
teddington
bridge
i
often
wonder
why
the
pantry
window
is
the
vulnerable
point
of
nine
houses
out
of
ten
this
house
of
ours
was
almost
the
tenth
for
the
window
in
question
had
bars
of
sorts
but
not
the
right
sort
the
only
bars
that
raffles
allowed
to
beat
him
were
the
kind
that
are
let
into
the
stone
outside
those
fixed
within
are
merely
screwed
to
the
woodwork
and
you
can
unscrew
as
many
as
necessary
if
you
take
the
trouble
and
have
the
time
barred
windows
are
usually
devoid
of
other
fasteners
worthy
the
name
this
one
was
no
exception
to
that
foolish
rule
and
a
push
with
the
did
its
business
i
am
giving
householders
some
valuable
hints
and
perhaps
deserving
a
good
mark
from
the
critics
these
in
any
case
are
the
points
that
i
would
see
to
were
i
a
rich
stockbroker
in
a
riverside
suburb
in
giving
good
advice
however
i
should
not
have
omitted
to
say
that
we
had
left
our
machines
in
the
shrubbery
in
front
or
that
raffles
had
most
ingeniously
fitted
our
lamps
with
dark
slides
which
enabled
us
to
leave
them
burning
it
proved
sufficient
to
unscrew
the
bars
at
the
bottom
only
and
then
to
wrench
them
to
either
side
neither
of
us
had
grown
stout
with
advancing
years
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
both
had
wormed
through
into
the
sink
and
thence
to
the
floor
it
was
not
an
absolutely
noiseless
process
but
once
in
the
pantry
we
were
mice
and
no
longer
blind
mice
there
was
a
but
we
did
not
meddle
with
that
raffles
went
armed
these
nights
with
a
better
light
than
gas
if
it
were
not
immoral
i
might
recommend
a
which
was
more
or
less
his
patent
it
was
that
handy
invention
the
electric
torch
fitted
by
raffles
with
a
dark
hood
to
fulfil
the
functions
of
a
slide
i
had
held
it
through
the
bars
while
he
undid
the
screws
and
now
he
held
it
to
the
keyhole
in
which
a
key
was
turned
upon
the
other
side
there
was
a
pause
for
consideration
and
in
the
pause
we
put
on
our
masks
it
was
never
known
that
these
thames
valley
robberies
were
all
committed
by
miscreants
decked
in
the
livery
of
crime
but
that
was
because
until
this
night
we
had
never
even
shown
our
masks
it
was
a
point
upon
which
raffles
had
insisted
on
all
feasible
occasions
since
his
furtive
return
to
the
world
it
twice
nearly
lost
us
everything
but
you
shall
hear
there
is
a
forceps
for
turning
keys
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
door
but
the
implement
is
not
so
easy
of
manipulation
as
it
might
be
raffles
for
one
preferred
a
sharp
knife
and
the
corner
of
the
panel
you
go
through
the
panel
because
that
is
thinnest
of
course
in
the
corner
nearest
the
key
and
you
use
a
knife
when
you
can
because
it
makes
least
noise
but
it
does
take
minutes
and
even
i
can
remember
shifting
the
electric
torch
from
one
hand
to
the
other
before
the
aperture
was
large
enough
to
receive
the
hand
and
wrist
of
raffles
he
had
at
such
times
a
motto
of
which
i
might
have
made
earlier
use
but
the
fact
is
that
i
have
only
once
before
described
a
downright
burglary
in
which
i
assisted
and
that
without
knowing
it
at
the
time
the
most
solemn
student
of
these
annals
can
not
affirm
that
he
has
cut
through
many
doors
in
our
company
since
what
was
to
me
the
maiden
effort
to
which
i
allude
i
however
have
cracked
only
too
many
a
crib
in
conjunction
with
raffles
and
at
the
crucial
moment
he
would
whisper
victory
or
wormwood
scrubbs
bunny
or
instead
of
wormwood
scrubbs
it
might
be
portland
bill
this
time
it
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
for
with
that
very
word
victory
upon
his
lips
they
whitened
and
parted
with
the
first
taste
of
defeat
my
hand
held
gasped
raffles
and
the
white
of
his
eyes
showed
all
round
the
iris
a
rarer
thing
than
you
may
think
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
the
shuffling
feet
and
the
low
excited
young
voices
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
a
faint
light
shone
round
raffles
wrist
well
done
beefy
hang
on
to
him
good
old
beefy
beefy
got
him
so
have
i
so
have
i
and
raffles
caught
my
arm
with
his
one
free
hand
they
got
me
tight
he
whispered
i
done
blaze
through
the
door
i
urged
and
might
have
done
it
had
i
been
armed
but
i
never
was
it
was
raffles
who
monopolized
that
risk
i
ca
it
the
boys
the
wrong
house
he
whispered
curse
the
fog
it
done
me
but
you
get
out
bunn
while
you
can
never
mind
me
it
my
turn
old
chap
his
one
hand
tightened
in
affectionate
farewell
i
put
the
electric
torch
in
it
before
i
went
trembling
in
every
inch
but
without
a
word
get
out
his
turn
yes
i
would
get
out
but
only
to
come
in
again
for
it
was
my
turn
mine
not
his
would
raffles
leave
me
held
by
a
hand
through
a
hole
in
a
door
what
he
would
have
done
in
my
place
was
the
thing
for
me
to
do
now
i
began
by
diving
through
the
pantry
window
and
coming
to
earth
upon
all
fours
but
even
as
i
stood
up
and
brushed
the
gravel
from
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
the
knees
of
my
knickerbockers
i
had
no
notion
what
to
do
next
and
yet
i
was
halfway
to
the
front
door
before
i
remembered
the
vile
crape
mask
upon
my
face
and
tore
it
off
as
the
door
flew
open
and
my
feet
were
on
the
steps
he
into
the
next
garden
i
cried
to
a
bevy
of
pyjamas
with
bare
feet
and
young
faces
at
either
end
of
them
who
who
said
they
giving
way
before
me
some
fellow
who
came
through
one
of
your
windows
the
other
johnny
the
other
johnny
the
cherubs
chorused
biking
past
saw
the
light
why
what
have
you
there
of
course
it
was
raffles
hand
that
they
had
but
now
i
was
in
the
hall
among
them
a
barrel
of
a
boy
did
all
the
holding
one
hand
round
the
wrist
the
other
palm
to
palm
and
his
knees
braced
up
against
the
panel
another
was
rendering
ostentatious
but
ineffectual
aid
and
three
or
four
others
danced
about
in
their
pyjamas
after
all
they
were
not
more
than
four
to
one
i
had
raised
my
voice
so
that
raffles
might
hear
me
and
take
heart
and
now
i
raised
it
again
yet
to
this
day
i
can
not
account
for
my
inspiration
that
proved
nothing
less
do
talk
so
loud
they
were
crying
below
their
breath
do
wake
upstairs
this
is
our
show
then
i
see
you
got
one
of
them
said
i
as
desired
well
if
you
want
the
other
you
can
have
him
too
i
believe
he
hurt
himself
after
him
after
him
they
exclaimed
as
one
but
i
think
he
got
over
the
wall
come
on
you
chaps
come
on
and
there
was
a
soft
stampede
to
the
hall
door
do
all
desert
me
i
say
gasped
the
hero
who
held
raffles
prisoner
we
must
have
them
both
beefy
that
all
very
well
look
here
i
interposed
i
stay
by
you
i
a
friend
outside
i
get
him
too
thanks
awfully
said
the
valiant
beefy
the
hall
was
empty
now
my
heart
beat
high
how
did
you
hear
them
i
inquired
my
eye
running
over
him
we
were
down
having
drinks
game
o
nap
in
there
beefy
jerked
his
great
head
toward
an
open
door
and
the
tail
of
my
eye
caught
the
glint
of
glasses
in
the
firelight
but
the
rest
of
it
was
otherwise
engaged
let
me
relieve
you
i
said
trembling
no
i
all
right
then
i
must
insist
and
before
he
could
answer
i
had
him
round
the
neck
with
such
a
will
that
not
a
gurgle
passed
my
fingers
for
they
were
almost
buried
in
his
hot
smooth
flesh
oh
i
am
not
proud
of
it
the
act
was
as
vile
as
act
could
be
but
i
was
not
going
to
see
raffles
taken
my
one
desire
was
to
be
the
saving
of
him
and
i
tremble
even
now
to
think
to
what
lengths
i
might
have
gone
for
its
fulfilment
as
it
was
i
squeezed
and
tugged
until
one
strong
hand
gave
way
after
the
other
and
came
feeling
round
for
me
but
feebly
because
they
had
held
on
so
long
and
what
do
you
suppose
was
happening
at
the
same
moment
the
pinched
white
hand
of
raffles
reddening
with
returning
blood
and
with
a
clot
of
blood
upon
the
wrist
was
craning
upward
and
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
without
a
moment
loss
steady
on
bunny
and
i
saw
that
beefy
ears
were
blue
but
raffles
was
feeling
in
his
pockets
as
he
spoke
now
let
him
breathe
said
he
clapping
his
handkerchief
over
the
poor
youth
mouth
an
empty
vial
was
in
his
other
hand
and
the
first
few
stertorous
breaths
that
the
poor
boy
took
were
the
end
of
him
for
the
time
being
oh
but
it
was
villainous
my
part
especially
for
he
must
have
been
far
gone
to
go
the
rest
of
the
way
so
readily
i
began
by
saying
i
was
not
proud
of
this
deed
but
its
dastardly
character
has
come
home
to
me
more
than
ever
with
the
penance
of
writing
it
out
i
see
in
myself
at
least
my
then
self
things
that
i
never
saw
quite
so
clearly
before
yet
let
me
be
quite
sure
that
i
would
not
do
the
same
again
i
had
not
the
smallest
desire
to
throttle
this
innocent
lad
nor
did
i
but
only
to
extricate
raffles
from
the
most
hopeless
position
he
was
ever
in
and
after
all
it
was
better
than
a
blow
from
behind
on
the
whole
i
will
not
alter
a
word
nor
whine
about
the
thing
any
more
we
lifted
the
plucky
fellow
into
raffles
place
in
the
pantry
locked
the
door
on
him
and
put
the
key
through
the
panel
now
was
the
moment
for
thinking
of
ourselves
and
again
that
infernal
mask
which
raffles
swore
by
came
near
the
undoing
of
us
both
we
had
reached
the
steps
when
we
were
hailed
by
a
voice
not
from
without
but
from
within
and
i
had
just
time
to
tear
the
accursed
thing
from
raffles
face
before
he
turned
a
stout
man
with
a
blonde
moustache
was
on
the
stairs
in
his
pyjamas
like
the
boys
what
are
you
doing
here
said
he
there
has
been
an
attempt
upon
your
house
said
i
still
spokesman
for
the
night
and
still
on
the
wings
of
inspiration
your
sons
my
pupils
indeed
well
they
heard
it
drove
off
the
thieves
and
have
given
chase
and
where
do
you
come
in
inquired
the
stout
man
descending
we
were
bicycling
past
and
i
actually
saw
one
fellow
come
through
your
pantry
window
i
think
he
got
over
the
wall
here
a
breathless
boy
returned
ca
see
anything
of
him
he
gasped
it
true
then
remarked
the
crammer
look
at
that
door
said
i
but
unfortunately
the
breathless
boy
looked
also
and
now
he
was
being
joined
by
others
equally
short
of
wind
where
beefy
he
screamed
what
on
earth
happened
to
beefy
my
good
boys
exclaimed
the
crammer
will
one
of
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
you
been
doing
and
what
these
gentlemen
have
been
doing
for
you
come
in
all
before
you
get
your
death
i
see
lights
in
the
and
more
than
lights
can
these
be
signs
of
a
carouse
a
very
innocent
one
sir
said
a
well
youth
with
more
moustache
than
i
have
yet
well
olphert
boys
will
be
boys
suppose
you
tell
me
what
happened
before
we
come
to
recriminations
the
bad
old
proverb
was
my
first
warning
i
caught
two
of
the
youths
exchanging
glances
under
raised
eyebrows
yet
their
stout
mentor
had
given
me
such
a
reassuring
glance
of
humor
as
between
man
of
the
world
and
man
of
the
world
that
it
was
difficult
to
suspect
him
of
suspicion
i
was
nevertheless
itching
to
be
gone
young
olphert
told
his
story
with
engaging
candor
it
was
true
that
they
had
come
down
for
an
hour
nap
and
cigarettes
well
and
there
was
no
denying
that
there
was
whiskey
in
the
glasses
the
boys
were
now
all
back
in
their
i
think
entirely
for
the
sake
of
warmth
but
raffles
and
i
were
in
knickerbockers
and
norfolk
jackets
and
very
naturally
remained
without
while
the
who
wore
bedroom
slippers
stood
on
the
threshold
with
an
eye
each
way
the
more
i
saw
of
the
man
the
better
i
liked
and
the
more
i
feared
him
his
chief
annoyance
thus
far
was
that
they
had
not
called
him
when
they
heard
the
noise
that
they
had
dreamt
of
leaving
him
out
of
the
fun
but
he
seemed
more
hurt
than
angry
about
that
well
sir
concluded
olphert
we
left
old
beefy
smith
hanging
on
to
his
hand
and
this
gentleman
with
him
so
perhaps
he
can
tell
us
what
happened
next
i
wish
i
could
i
cried
with
all
their
eyes
upon
me
for
i
had
had
time
to
think
some
of
you
must
have
heard
me
say
i
fetch
my
friend
in
from
the
road
yes
i
did
piped
an
innocent
from
within
well
and
when
i
came
back
with
him
things
were
exactly
as
you
see
them
now
evidently
the
man
strength
was
too
much
for
the
boy
but
whether
he
ran
upstairs
or
outside
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
it
was
like
that
boy
to
run
either
way
said
the
crammer
cocking
a
clear
blue
eye
on
me
but
if
he
gave
chase
it
was
like
him
even
to
let
go
i
do
believe
beefy
ever
would
put
in
olphert
that
why
we
gave
him
the
billet
he
may
have
followed
him
through
the
pantry
window
i
suggested
wildly
but
the
door
shut
put
in
a
boy
i
have
a
look
at
it
said
the
crammer
and
the
key
no
longer
in
the
lock
and
the
insensible
youth
within
the
key
would
be
missed
the
door
kicked
in
nay
with
the
man
eye
still
upon
me
i
thought
i
could
smell
the
chloroform
i
thought
i
could
hear
a
moan
and
prepared
for
either
any
moment
and
how
he
did
stare
i
have
detested
blue
eyes
ever
since
and
blonde
moustaches
and
the
whole
stout
type
that
is
not
such
a
fool
as
it
looks
i
had
brazened
it
out
with
the
boys
but
the
first
grown
man
was
too
many
for
me
and
the
blood
ran
out
of
my
heart
as
though
there
was
no
raffles
at
my
back
indeed
i
had
forgotten
him
i
had
so
longed
to
put
this
thing
through
by
myself
even
in
my
extremity
it
was
almost
a
disappointment
to
me
when
his
dear
cool
voice
fell
like
a
delicious
draught
upon
my
ears
but
its
effect
upon
the
others
is
more
interesting
to
recall
until
now
the
crammer
had
the
centre
of
the
stage
but
at
this
point
raffles
usurped
a
place
which
was
always
his
at
will
people
would
wait
for
what
he
had
to
say
as
these
people
waited
now
for
the
simplest
and
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
one
moment
he
had
begun
well
said
the
crammer
relieving
me
of
his
eyes
at
last
i
do
want
to
lose
any
of
the
fun
nor
must
you
said
the
crammer
with
emphasis
but
we
left
our
bikes
outside
and
mine
a
beeston
humber
continued
raffles
if
you
do
mind
we
bring
in
before
these
fellows
get
away
on
them
and
out
he
went
without
a
look
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
i
after
him
with
a
determined
imitation
of
his
but
i
would
have
given
something
to
turn
round
i
believe
that
for
one
moment
the
shrewd
instructor
was
taken
in
but
as
i
reached
the
steps
i
heard
him
asking
his
pupils
whether
any
of
them
had
seen
any
bicycles
outside
that
moment
however
made
the
difference
we
were
in
the
shrubbery
raffles
with
his
electric
torch
drawn
and
blazing
when
we
heard
the
kicking
at
the
pantry
door
and
in
the
drive
with
our
bicycles
before
man
and
boys
poured
down
the
steps
we
rushed
our
machines
to
the
nearer
gate
for
both
were
shut
and
we
got
through
and
swung
it
home
behind
us
in
the
nick
of
time
even
i
could
mount
before
they
could
reopen
the
gate
which
raffles
held
against
them
for
half
an
instant
with
unnecessary
gallantry
but
he
would
see
me
in
front
of
him
and
so
it
fell
to
me
to
lead
the
way
now
i
have
said
that
it
was
a
very
misty
night
hence
the
whole
thing
and
also
that
these
houses
were
on
a
hill
but
they
were
not
nearly
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
i
did
what
i
firmly
believe
that
almost
everybody
would
have
done
in
my
place
raffles
indeed
said
he
would
have
done
it
himself
but
that
was
his
generosity
and
he
was
the
one
man
who
would
not
what
i
did
was
to
turn
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
other
gate
where
we
might
so
easily
have
been
cut
off
and
to
pedal
for
my
life
my
god
i
shouted
when
i
found
it
out
can
you
turn
in
your
own
length
asked
raffles
following
loyally
not
certain
then
stick
to
it
you
could
help
it
but
it
the
devil
of
a
hill
and
here
they
come
let
them
said
raffles
and
brandished
his
electric
torch
our
only
light
as
yet
a
hill
seems
endless
in
the
dark
for
you
can
not
see
the
end
and
with
the
patter
of
bare
feet
gaining
on
us
i
thought
this
one
could
have
no
end
at
all
of
course
the
boys
could
charge
up
it
quicker
than
we
could
pedal
but
i
even
heard
the
voice
of
their
stout
instructor
growing
louder
through
the
mist
oh
to
think
i
let
you
in
for
this
i
groaned
my
head
over
the
every
ounce
of
my
weight
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
i
glanced
at
raffles
and
in
the
white
light
of
his
torch
he
was
doing
it
all
with
his
ankles
exactly
as
though
he
had
been
riding
in
a
gymkhana
it
the
most
sporting
chase
i
was
ever
in
said
he
all
my
fault
my
dear
bunny
i
would
have
missed
it
for
the
world
nor
would
he
forge
ahead
of
me
though
he
could
have
done
so
in
a
moment
he
who
from
his
boyhood
had
done
everything
of
the
kind
so
much
better
than
anybody
else
no
he
must
ride
a
wheel
length
behind
me
and
now
we
could
not
only
hear
the
boys
running
but
breathing
also
and
then
of
a
sudden
i
saw
raffles
on
my
right
striking
with
his
torch
a
face
flew
out
of
the
darkness
to
meet
the
thick
glass
bulb
with
the
glowing
wire
enclosed
it
was
the
face
of
the
boy
olphert
with
his
enviable
moustache
but
it
vanished
with
the
crash
of
glass
and
the
naked
wire
thickened
to
the
eye
like
a
struck
i
saw
no
more
of
that
one
of
them
had
crept
up
on
my
side
also
as
i
looked
hearing
him
pant
he
was
grabbing
at
my
left
handle
and
i
nearly
sent
raffles
into
the
hedge
by
the
sharp
turn
i
took
to
the
right
his
wheel
length
saved
him
but
my
boy
could
run
was
overhauling
me
again
seemed
certain
of
me
this
time
when
all
at
once
the
sunbeam
ran
easily
every
ounce
of
my
weight
with
either
foot
once
more
and
i
was
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
gray
road
reeling
out
from
under
me
as
i
felt
for
my
brake
i
looked
back
at
raffles
he
had
put
up
his
feet
i
screwed
my
head
round
still
further
and
there
were
the
boys
in
their
pyjamas
their
hands
upon
their
knees
like
so
many
and
a
big
man
shaking
his
fist
there
was
a
on
the
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
we
sailed
down
to
the
river
then
on
through
thames
ditton
as
far
as
esher
station
when
we
turned
sharp
to
the
right
and
from
the
dark
stretch
by
imber
court
came
to
light
in
molesey
and
were
soon
pedalling
like
gentlemen
of
leisure
through
bushey
park
our
lights
turned
up
the
broken
torch
put
out
and
away
the
big
gates
had
long
been
shut
but
you
can
manoeuvre
a
bicycle
through
the
others
we
had
no
further
adventures
on
the
way
home
and
our
coffee
was
still
warm
upon
the
hob
but
i
think
it
an
occasion
for
sullivans
said
raffles
who
now
kept
them
for
such
by
all
my
gods
bunny
it
been
the
most
sporting
night
we
ever
had
in
our
lives
and
do
you
know
which
was
the
most
sporting
part
of
it
that
ride
i
was
thinking
of
it
turning
your
torch
into
a
truncheon
my
dear
bunny
a
gallant
lad
i
hated
hitting
him
i
know
i
said
the
way
you
got
us
out
of
the
house
no
bunny
said
raffles
blowing
rings
it
came
before
that
you
sinner
and
you
know
it
you
do
mean
anything
i
did
said
i
for
i
began
to
see
that
this
was
what
he
did
mean
and
now
at
latest
it
will
also
be
seen
why
this
story
has
been
told
with
undue
and
inexcusable
gusto
there
is
none
other
like
it
for
me
to
tell
it
is
my
one
in
all
these
annals
but
raffles
had
a
ruder
name
for
it
it
was
the
apotheosis
of
the
bunny
said
he
but
in
a
tone
i
never
shall
forget
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
or
saying
i
said
the
whole
thing
was
a
fluke
then
said
raffles
it
was
the
kind
of
fluke
i
always
trusted
you
to
make
when
runs
were
wanted
and
he
held
out
his
dear
old
hand
the
knees
of
the
gods
i
the
worst
of
this
war
said
raffles
is
the
way
it
puts
a
fellow
off
his
work
it
was
of
course
the
winter
before
last
and
we
had
done
nothing
dreadful
since
the
early
autumn
undoubtedly
the
war
was
the
cause
not
that
we
were
among
the
earlier
victims
of
the
fever
i
took
disgracefully
little
interest
in
the
negotiations
while
the
ultimatum
appealed
to
raffles
as
a
sporting
flutter
then
we
gave
the
whole
thing
till
christmas
we
still
missed
the
cricket
in
the
papers
but
one
russet
afternoon
we
were
in
richmond
and
a
terrible
type
was
shouting
himself
hoarse
with
british
lorsses
orful
slorter
the
orful
slorter
orful
slorter
british
lorsses
i
thought
the
terrible
type
had
invented
it
but
raffles
gave
him
more
than
he
asked
and
then
i
held
the
bicycle
while
he
tried
to
pronounce
eland
laagte
we
were
never
again
without
our
sheaf
of
evening
papers
and
raffles
ordered
three
morning
ones
and
i
gave
up
mine
in
spite
of
its
literary
page
we
became
strategists
we
knew
exactly
what
buller
was
to
do
on
landing
and
still
better
what
the
other
generals
should
have
done
our
map
was
the
best
that
could
be
bought
with
flags
that
deserved
a
better
fate
than
standing
still
raffles
woke
me
to
hear
the
beggar
on
the
morning
it
appeared
he
was
one
of
the
first
substantial
subscribers
to
the
fund
by
this
time
our
dear
landlady
was
more
excited
than
we
to
our
enthusiasm
for
thomas
she
added
a
personal
bitterness
against
the
wild
boars
as
she
persisted
in
calling
them
each
time
as
though
it
were
the
first
i
could
linger
over
our
landlady
attitude
in
the
whole
matter
that
was
her
only
joke
about
it
and
the
true
humorist
never
smiled
at
it
herself
but
you
had
only
to
say
a
syllable
for
a
venerable
gentleman
declared
by
her
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
to
hear
what
she
could
do
to
him
if
she
caught
him
she
could
put
him
in
a
cage
and
go
on
tour
with
him
and
make
him
howl
and
dance
for
his
food
like
a
debased
bear
before
a
fresh
audience
every
day
yet
a
more
woman
i
have
never
known
the
war
did
not
uplift
our
landlady
as
it
did
her
lodgers
but
presently
it
ceased
to
have
that
precise
effect
upon
us
bad
was
being
made
worse
and
worse
and
then
came
more
than
englishmen
could
endure
in
that
black
week
across
which
the
names
of
three
african
villages
are
written
forever
in
letters
of
blood
all
three
pegs
groaned
raffles
on
the
last
morning
of
the
week
it
was
his
first
word
of
cricket
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
we
were
both
depressed
old
had
fallen
and
i
know
raffles
envied
them
he
spoke
so
wistfully
of
such
an
end
to
cheer
him
up
i
proposed
to
break
into
one
of
the
many
more
or
less
royal
residences
in
our
neighborhood
a
tough
crib
was
what
he
needed
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
what
he
said
to
me
there
was
less
crime
in
england
that
winter
than
for
years
past
there
was
none
at
all
in
raffles
and
yet
there
were
those
who
could
denounce
the
war
so
we
went
on
for
a
few
of
those
dark
days
raffles
very
glum
and
grim
till
one
fine
morning
the
yeomanry
idea
put
new
heart
into
us
all
it
struck
me
at
once
as
the
glorious
scheme
it
was
to
prove
but
it
did
not
hit
me
where
it
hit
others
i
was
not
a
and
the
gentlemen
of
england
would
scarcely
have
owned
me
as
one
of
them
the
case
of
raffles
was
in
that
respect
still
more
hopeless
he
who
had
even
played
for
them
at
lord
and
he
seemed
to
feel
it
he
would
not
speak
to
me
all
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
he
went
for
a
walk
alone
it
was
another
man
who
came
home
flourishing
a
small
bottle
packed
in
white
paper
bunny
said
he
i
never
did
lift
my
elbow
it
the
one
vice
i
never
had
it
has
taken
me
all
these
years
to
find
my
tipple
bunny
but
here
it
is
my
panacea
my
elixir
my
magic
philtre
i
thought
he
had
been
at
it
on
the
road
and
asked
him
the
name
of
the
stuff
look
and
see
bunny
and
if
it
was
a
bottle
of
ladies
warranted
to
change
any
shade
into
the
once
fashionable
yellow
within
a
given
number
of
applications
what
on
earth
said
i
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
dye
for
my
country
he
cried
swelling
dulce
et
decorum
est
bunny
my
boy
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
the
front
if
i
can
without
coming
to
it
i
looked
at
him
as
he
stood
in
the
firelight
straight
as
a
dart
spare
but
wiry
alert
laughing
flushed
from
his
wintry
walk
and
as
i
looked
all
the
years
that
i
had
known
him
and
more
besides
slipped
from
him
in
my
eyes
i
saw
him
captain
of
the
eleven
at
school
i
saw
him
running
with
the
muddy
ball
on
days
like
this
running
round
the
other
fifteen
as
a
round
a
flock
of
sheep
he
had
his
cap
on
still
and
but
for
the
gray
hairs
underneath
but
here
i
lost
him
in
a
sudden
mist
it
was
not
sorrow
at
his
going
for
i
did
not
mean
to
let
him
go
alone
it
was
enthusiasm
admiration
affection
and
also
i
believe
a
sudden
regret
that
he
had
not
always
appealed
to
that
part
of
my
nature
to
which
he
was
appealing
now
it
was
a
little
thrill
of
penitence
enough
of
it
i
think
it
great
of
you
i
said
and
at
first
that
was
all
how
he
laughed
at
me
he
had
had
his
innings
there
was
no
better
way
of
getting
out
he
had
scored
off
an
african
millionaire
the
players
a
queensland
legislator
the
camorra
the
late
lord
ernest
belville
and
again
and
again
off
scotland
yard
what
more
could
one
man
do
in
one
lifetime
and
at
the
worst
it
was
the
death
to
die
no
bed
no
doctor
no
temperature
and
raffles
stopped
himself
no
pinioning
no
white
cap
he
added
if
you
like
that
better
i
do
like
any
of
it
i
cried
cordially
you
simply
got
to
come
back
to
what
he
asked
a
strange
look
on
him
and
i
wondered
for
one
instant
whether
my
little
thrill
had
gone
through
him
he
was
not
a
man
of
little
thrills
then
for
a
minute
i
was
in
misery
of
course
i
wanted
to
go
too
he
shook
my
hand
without
a
word
but
how
could
i
they
would
never
have
me
a
branded
jailbird
in
the
imperial
yeomanry
raffles
burst
out
laughing
he
had
been
looking
very
hard
at
me
for
about
three
seconds
you
rabbit
he
cried
even
to
think
of
it
we
might
as
well
offer
ourselves
to
the
metropolitan
police
force
no
bunny
we
go
out
to
the
cape
on
our
own
and
that
where
we
enlist
one
of
these
regiments
of
irregular
horse
is
the
thing
for
us
you
spent
part
of
your
pretty
penny
on
i
believe
and
you
remember
how
i
rode
in
the
bush
we
the
very
men
for
them
bunny
and
they
ask
to
see
our
birthmarks
out
there
i
do
think
even
my
hoary
locks
would
put
them
off
but
it
would
be
too
conspicuous
in
the
ranks
our
landlady
first
wept
on
hearing
our
determination
and
then
longed
to
have
the
pulling
of
certain
whiskers
with
the
tongs
and
they
should
be
but
from
that
day
and
for
as
many
as
were
left
to
us
the
good
soul
made
more
of
us
than
ever
not
that
she
was
at
all
surprised
dear
brave
gentlemen
who
could
look
for
burglars
on
their
bicycles
at
dead
of
night
it
was
only
what
you
might
expect
of
them
bless
their
lion
hearts
i
wanted
to
wink
at
raffles
but
he
would
not
catch
my
eye
he
was
a
raffles
by
the
end
of
january
and
it
was
extraordinary
what
a
difference
it
made
his
most
elaborate
disguises
had
not
been
more
effectual
than
this
simple
expedient
and
with
khaki
to
complete
the
subdual
of
his
individuality
he
had
every
hope
of
escaping
recognition
in
the
field
the
man
he
dreaded
was
the
officer
he
had
known
in
old
days
there
were
ever
so
many
of
him
at
the
front
and
it
was
to
minimize
this
risk
that
we
went
out
at
the
beginning
of
february
it
was
a
weeping
day
a
day
in
a
shroud
cold
as
clay
yet
for
that
very
reason
an
ideal
day
upon
which
to
leave
england
for
the
sunny
front
yet
my
heart
was
heavy
as
i
looked
my
last
at
her
it
was
heavy
as
the
raw
thick
air
until
raffles
came
and
leant
upon
the
rail
at
my
side
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
and
you
got
to
stop
said
he
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
bunny
whether
we
do
or
we
do
and
thinking
wo
make
us
see
over
their
shoulders
ii
now
i
made
as
bad
a
soldier
except
at
heart
as
raffles
made
a
good
one
and
i
could
not
say
a
harder
thing
of
myself
my
ignorance
of
matters
military
was
up
to
that
time
unfathomable
and
is
still
profound
i
was
always
a
fool
with
horses
though
i
did
not
think
so
at
one
time
and
i
had
never
been
any
good
with
a
gun
the
average
tommy
may
be
my
intellectual
inferior
but
he
must
know
some
part
of
his
work
better
than
i
ever
knew
any
of
mine
i
never
even
learnt
to
be
killed
i
do
not
mean
that
i
ever
ran
away
the
south
african
field
force
might
have
been
strengthened
if
i
had
the
foregoing
remarks
do
not
express
a
pose
affected
out
of
superiority
to
the
usual
spirit
of
the
conquering
hero
for
no
man
was
keener
on
the
war
than
i
before
i
went
to
it
but
one
can
only
write
with
gusto
of
events
like
that
little
affair
at
surbiton
in
which
one
has
acquitted
oneself
without
discredit
and
i
can
not
say
that
of
my
part
in
the
war
of
which
i
now
loathe
the
thought
for
other
reasons
the
battlefield
was
no
place
for
me
and
neither
was
the
camp
my
ineptitude
made
me
the
butt
of
the
looting
cursing
lot
who
formed
the
very
irregular
squadron
which
we
joined
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
me
but
for
raffles
who
was
soon
the
darling
devil
of
them
all
but
never
more
loyally
my
friend
your
fireside
does
not
think
of
these
things
he
imagines
all
the
fighting
to
be
with
the
enemy
he
will
probably
be
horrified
to
hear
that
men
can
detest
each
other
as
cordially
in
khaki
as
in
any
other
wear
and
with
a
virulence
seldom
inspired
by
the
bearded
in
the
opposite
trench
to
the
fireside
therefore
for
you
have
seen
me
one
myself
i
dedicate
the
story
of
corporal
connal
captain
bellingham
the
general
raffles
and
myself
i
must
be
vague
for
obvious
reasons
the
troop
is
fighting
as
i
write
you
will
soon
hear
why
i
am
not
but
neither
is
raffles
nor
corporal
connal
they
are
fighting
as
well
as
ever
those
other
sons
of
all
soils
but
i
am
not
going
to
say
where
it
was
that
we
fought
with
them
i
believe
that
no
body
of
men
of
equal
size
has
done
half
so
much
heroic
work
but
they
had
got
themselves
a
bad
name
off
the
field
so
to
speak
and
i
am
not
going
to
make
it
worse
by
saddling
them
before
the
world
with
raffles
and
myself
and
that
ruffian
connal
the
fellow
was
a
mongrel
type
a
glasgow
irishman
by
birth
and
upbringing
but
he
had
been
in
south
africa
for
years
and
he
certainly
knew
the
country
very
well
this
circumstance
coupled
with
the
fact
that
he
was
a
very
handy
man
with
horses
as
all
colonists
are
had
procured
him
the
first
small
step
from
the
ranks
which
facilitates
bullying
if
a
man
be
a
bully
by
nature
and
is
physically
fitted
to
be
a
successful
one
connal
was
a
hulking
ruffian
and
in
me
had
ideal
game
the
brute
was
offensive
to
me
from
the
hour
i
joined
the
details
are
of
no
importance
but
i
stood
up
to
him
at
first
in
words
and
finally
for
a
few
seconds
on
my
feet
then
i
went
down
like
an
ox
and
raffles
came
out
of
his
tent
their
fight
lasted
twenty
minutes
and
raffles
was
marked
but
the
net
result
was
dreadfully
conventional
for
the
bully
was
a
bully
no
more
but
i
began
gradually
to
suspect
that
he
was
something
worse
all
this
time
we
were
fighting
every
day
or
so
it
seems
when
i
look
back
never
a
great
engagement
and
yet
never
a
day
when
we
were
wholly
out
of
touch
with
the
enemy
i
had
thus
several
opportunities
of
watching
the
other
enemy
under
fire
and
had
almost
convinced
myself
of
the
systematic
harmlessness
of
his
own
shooting
when
a
more
glaring
incident
occurred
one
night
three
troops
of
our
squadron
were
ordered
to
a
certain
point
whither
they
had
patrolled
the
previous
week
but
our
own
particular
troop
was
to
stay
behind
and
in
charge
of
no
other
than
the
villanous
corporal
both
our
officer
and
sergeant
having
gone
into
hospital
with
enteric
our
detention
however
was
very
temporary
and
connal
would
seem
to
have
received
the
usual
vague
orders
to
proceed
in
the
early
morning
to
the
place
where
the
other
three
companies
had
camped
it
appeared
that
we
were
to
form
an
escort
to
two
containing
kits
provisions
and
ammunition
before
daylight
connal
had
reported
his
departure
to
the
commanding
officer
and
we
passed
the
outposts
at
gray
dawn
now
though
i
was
perhaps
the
least
observant
person
in
the
troop
i
was
not
the
least
wideawake
where
corporal
connal
was
concerned
and
it
struck
me
at
once
that
we
were
heading
in
the
wrong
direction
my
reasons
are
not
material
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
last
week
patrol
had
pushed
its
khaki
tentacles
both
east
and
west
and
eastward
they
had
met
with
resistance
so
determined
as
to
compel
them
to
retire
yet
it
was
eastward
that
we
were
travelling
now
i
at
once
spurred
alongside
raffles
as
he
rode
bronzed
and
bearded
with
warworn
over
eyes
grown
keen
as
a
hawk
and
a
sticking
straight
out
from
his
front
teeth
i
can
see
him
now
so
gaunt
and
grim
and
debonair
yet
already
with
much
of
the
nonsense
gone
out
of
him
though
i
thought
he
only
smiled
on
my
misgivings
did
he
get
the
instructions
bunny
or
did
we
very
well
then
give
the
devil
a
chance
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
but
i
felt
more
crushed
than
convinced
so
we
jogged
along
into
broad
daylight
until
raffles
himself
gave
a
whistle
of
surprise
a
white
flag
bunny
by
all
my
gods
i
could
not
see
it
he
had
the
longest
sight
in
all
our
squadron
but
in
a
little
the
fluttering
emblem
which
had
gained
such
a
sinister
significance
in
most
of
our
eyes
was
patent
even
to
mine
a
little
longer
and
the
shaggy
boer
was
in
our
midst
upon
his
shaggy
pony
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
he
was
on
his
way
to
our
lines
with
some
missive
and
had
little
enough
to
say
to
us
though
frivolous
and
flippant
questions
were
showered
upon
him
from
most
saddles
any
boers
over
there
asked
one
pointing
in
the
direction
in
which
we
were
still
heading
shut
up
interjected
raffles
in
crisp
rebuke
the
boer
looked
stolid
but
sinister
any
of
our
chaps
added
another
the
boer
rode
on
with
an
open
grin
and
the
incredible
conclusion
of
the
matter
was
that
we
were
actually
within
their
lines
in
another
hour
saw
them
as
large
as
life
within
a
mile
and
a
half
on
either
side
of
us
and
must
every
man
of
us
have
been
taken
prisoner
had
not
every
man
but
connal
refused
to
go
one
inch
further
and
had
not
the
boers
themselves
obviously
suspected
some
subtle
ruse
as
the
only
conceivable
explanation
of
so
madcap
a
manoeuvre
they
allowed
us
to
retire
without
firing
a
shot
and
retire
you
may
be
sure
we
did
the
kaffirs
flogging
their
teams
in
a
fury
of
fear
and
our
precious
corporal
sullen
but
defiant
i
have
said
this
was
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
and
i
blush
to
repeat
that
it
practically
was
connal
was
indeed
wheeled
up
before
the
colonel
but
his
instructions
were
not
written
instructions
and
he
lied
his
way
out
with
equal
hardihood
and
tact
you
said
there
sir
he
stoutly
reiterated
and
the
vagueness
with
which
such
orders
were
undoubtedly
given
was
the
saving
of
him
for
the
time
being
i
need
not
tell
you
how
indignant
i
felt
for
one
the
fellow
is
a
spy
i
said
to
raffles
with
no
nursery
oath
as
we
strolled
within
the
lines
that
night
he
merely
smiled
in
my
face
and
have
you
only
just
found
it
out
bunny
i
have
known
it
almost
ever
since
we
joined
but
this
morning
i
did
think
we
had
him
on
toast
it
disgraceful
that
we
had
not
cried
i
he
ought
to
have
been
shot
like
a
dog
not
so
loud
bunny
though
i
quite
agree
but
i
do
regret
what
has
happened
as
much
as
you
do
not
that
i
am
less
bloodthirsty
than
you
are
in
this
case
but
a
good
deal
more
so
bunny
i
on
bowling
him
out
with
my
own
unaided
hand
though
i
may
ask
you
to
take
the
wicket
meanwhile
do
wear
all
your
animosity
upon
your
sleeve
the
fellow
has
friends
who
still
believe
in
him
and
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
more
openly
his
enemy
than
you
were
before
well
i
can
only
vow
that
i
did
my
best
to
follow
this
sound
advice
but
who
but
a
raffles
can
control
his
every
look
it
was
never
my
forte
as
you
know
yet
to
this
day
i
can
not
conceive
what
i
did
to
excite
the
treacherous
corporal
suspicions
he
was
clever
enough
however
not
to
betray
them
and
lucky
enough
to
turn
the
tables
on
us
as
you
shall
hear
iii
bloemfontein
had
fallen
since
our
arrival
but
there
was
plenty
of
fight
in
the
free
staters
still
and
i
will
not
deny
that
it
was
these
gentry
who
were
showing
us
the
sport
for
which
our
corps
came
in
constant
skirmishing
was
our
portion
with
now
and
then
an
action
that
you
would
know
at
least
by
name
did
i
feel
free
to
mention
them
but
i
do
not
and
indeed
it
is
better
so
i
have
not
to
describe
the
war
even
as
i
saw
it
i
am
thankful
to
say
but
only
the
martial
story
of
us
two
and
those
others
of
whom
you
wot
corporal
connal
was
the
dangerous
blackguard
you
have
seen
captain
bellingham
is
best
known
for
his
position
in
the
batting
averages
a
year
or
two
ago
and
for
his
subsequent
failure
to
obtain
a
place
in
any
of
the
five
test
matches
but
i
only
think
of
him
as
the
officer
who
recognized
raffles
we
had
taken
a
village
making
quite
a
little
name
for
it
and
for
ourselves
and
in
the
village
our
division
was
reinforced
by
a
fresh
brigade
of
the
imperial
troops
it
was
a
day
of
rest
our
first
for
weeks
but
raffles
and
i
spent
no
small
part
of
it
in
seeking
high
and
low
for
a
worthy
means
of
quenching
the
kind
of
thirst
which
used
to
beset
yeomen
and
others
who
had
left
good
cellars
for
the
veldt
the
old
knack
came
back
to
us
both
though
i
believe
that
i
alone
was
conscious
of
it
at
the
time
and
we
were
leaving
the
house
splendidly
supplied
when
we
almost
ran
into
the
arms
of
an
infantry
officer
with
a
scowl
upon
his
face
and
an
flaming
at
us
in
the
sun
peter
bellingham
gasped
raffles
under
his
breath
and
then
we
saluted
and
tried
to
pass
on
with
the
bottles
ringing
like
under
our
khaki
but
captain
bellingham
was
a
hard
man
what
have
you
men
been
doin
drawled
he
nothing
sir
we
protested
like
innocence
with
an
injury
lootin
forbidden
said
he
you
had
better
let
me
see
those
bottles
we
are
done
whispered
raffles
and
straightway
we
made
a
sideboard
of
the
stoop
across
which
he
had
crept
at
so
inopportune
a
moment
i
had
not
the
heart
to
raise
my
eyes
again
yet
it
was
many
moments
before
the
officer
broke
silence
uam
var
he
murmured
reverentially
at
last
and
long
john
of
ben
nevis
the
first
drop
that
been
discovered
in
the
whole
show
what
lot
do
you
two
belong
to
i
answered
i
must
have
your
names
in
my
agitation
i
gave
my
real
one
raffles
had
turned
away
as
though
in
contemplation
of
our
lost
loot
i
saw
the
officer
studying
his
with
an
alarming
face
what
your
name
he
rapped
out
at
last
but
his
strange
low
voice
said
plainly
that
he
knew
and
raffles
faced
him
with
the
monosyllable
of
confession
and
assent
i
did
not
count
the
seconds
until
the
next
word
but
it
was
captain
bellingham
who
uttered
it
at
last
i
thought
you
were
dead
now
you
see
i
am
not
but
you
are
at
your
old
games
i
am
not
cried
raffles
and
his
tone
was
new
to
me
i
have
seldom
heard
one
more
indignant
yes
he
continued
this
is
loot
and
the
wrong
will
out
that
what
you
thinking
peter
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
he
is
let
out
in
the
field
we
playing
the
game
as
much
as
you
are
old
sir
the
plural
number
caused
the
captain
to
toss
me
a
contemptuous
look
is
this
the
fellah
who
was
taken
when
you
swam
for
it
he
inquired
relapsing
into
his
drawl
raffles
said
i
was
and
with
that
took
a
passionate
oath
upon
our
absolute
rectitude
as
volunteers
there
could
be
no
doubting
him
but
the
officer
eyes
went
back
at
the
bottles
on
the
stoop
but
look
at
those
said
he
and
as
he
looked
himself
the
light
eye
melted
in
his
fiery
face
and
i
got
sparklets
in
my
tent
he
sighed
you
make
it
in
a
minute
not
a
word
from
raffles
and
none
you
may
be
sure
from
me
then
suddenly
bellingham
told
me
where
his
tent
was
and
adding
that
our
case
was
one
for
serious
consideration
strode
in
its
direction
without
another
word
until
some
sunlit
paces
separated
us
you
can
bring
that
stuff
with
you
he
then
flung
over
a
and
i
advise
you
to
put
it
where
you
had
it
before
a
trooper
saluted
him
some
yards
further
on
and
looked
evilly
at
us
as
we
followed
with
our
loot
it
was
corporal
connal
of
ours
and
the
thought
of
him
takes
my
mind
off
the
certainly
gallant
captain
who
only
that
day
had
joined
our
division
with
the
reinforcements
i
could
not
stand
the
man
myself
he
added
to
our
whiskey
in
his
tent
and
would
only
keep
a
couple
of
bottles
when
we
came
away
softened
by
the
spirit
to
which
disuse
made
us
all
a
little
sensitive
our
officer
was
soon
convinced
of
the
honest
part
that
we
were
playing
for
once
and
for
fifty
minutes
of
the
hour
we
spent
with
him
he
and
raffles
talked
cricket
without
a
break
on
parting
they
even
shook
hands
that
was
long
john
in
the
captain
head
but
the
snob
never
addressed
a
syllable
to
me
and
now
to
the
who
was
still
corporal
of
our
troop
it
was
not
long
before
raffles
was
to
have
his
wish
and
the
traitor
wicket
we
had
resumed
our
advance
or
rather
our
humble
part
in
the
great
surrounding
movement
then
taking
place
and
were
under
pretty
heavy
fire
once
more
when
connal
was
shot
in
the
hand
it
was
a
curious
casualty
in
more
than
one
respect
and
nobody
seems
to
have
seen
it
happen
though
a
flesh
wound
it
was
a
bloody
one
and
that
may
be
why
the
surgeon
did
not
at
once
detect
those
features
which
afterwards
convinced
him
that
the
injury
had
been
it
was
the
right
hand
and
until
it
healed
the
man
could
be
of
no
further
use
in
the
firing
line
nor
was
the
case
serious
enough
for
admission
to
a
crowded
and
connal
himself
offered
his
services
as
custodian
of
a
number
of
our
horses
which
we
were
keeping
out
of
way
in
a
donga
they
had
come
there
in
the
following
manner
that
morning
we
had
been
heliographed
to
reinforce
the
only
to
find
that
the
enemy
had
the
range
to
a
nicety
when
we
reached
the
spot
there
were
trenches
for
us
men
but
no
place
of
safety
for
our
horses
nearer
than
this
long
and
narrow
donga
which
ran
from
within
our
lines
towards
those
of
the
boers
so
some
of
us
galloped
them
thither
amid
the
whine
of
shrapnel
and
the
whistle
of
shot
i
remember
the
man
next
me
being
killed
by
a
shell
with
all
his
team
and
the
tangle
of
flying
harness
torn
horseflesh
and
crimson
khaki
that
we
left
behind
us
on
the
veldt
also
that
a
small
red
flag
ludicrously
like
those
used
to
indicate
a
marked
the
single
sloping
entrance
to
the
otherwise
precipitous
donga
which
i
for
one
was
duly
thankful
to
reach
alive
the
same
evening
connal
with
a
few
other
light
casualties
to
assist
him
took
over
the
charge
for
which
he
had
volunteered
and
for
which
he
was
so
admirably
fitted
by
his
knowledge
of
horses
and
his
general
experience
of
the
country
nevertheless
he
managed
to
lose
three
or
four
fine
chargers
in
the
course
of
the
first
night
and
early
in
the
second
raffles
shook
me
out
of
a
heavy
slumber
in
the
trenches
where
we
had
been
firing
all
day
i
have
found
the
spot
bunny
he
whispered
we
ought
to
out
him
before
the
night
is
over
connal
raffles
nodded
you
know
what
happened
to
some
of
his
horses
last
night
well
he
let
them
go
himself
never
i
as
certain
of
it
said
raffles
as
though
i
seen
him
do
it
and
if
he
does
it
again
i
shall
see
him
i
can
even
tell
you
how
it
happened
connal
insisted
on
having
one
end
of
the
donga
to
himself
and
of
course
his
end
is
the
one
nearest
the
boers
well
then
he
tells
the
other
fellows
to
go
to
sleep
at
their
end
i
have
it
direct
from
one
of
them
and
you
bet
they
do
need
a
second
invitation
the
rest
i
hope
to
see
it
seems
almost
incredible
said
i
not
more
so
than
the
light
horseman
dodge
of
poisoning
the
troughs
that
happened
at
ladysmith
before
christmas
and
two
kind
friends
did
for
that
blackguard
what
you
and
i
are
going
to
do
for
this
one
and
a
did
the
rest
brutes
a
mounted
man
worth
a
file
on
foot
in
this
country
and
well
they
know
it
but
this
beauty
goes
one
better
than
the
poison
that
was
wilful
waste
but
i
eat
my
wideawake
if
our
loss
last
night
was
the
enemy
double
gain
what
we
got
to
do
bunny
is
to
catch
him
in
the
act
it
may
mean
watching
him
all
night
but
was
ever
game
so
well
worth
the
candle
one
may
say
in
passing
that
at
this
particular
point
of
contact
the
enemy
were
in
superior
force
and
for
once
in
a
mood
as
aggressive
as
our
own
they
were
led
with
a
dash
and
handled
with
a
skill
which
did
not
always
characterize
their
commanders
at
this
stage
of
the
war
their
position
was
very
similar
to
ours
and
indeed
we
were
to
spend
the
whole
of
next
day
in
trying
with
an
equal
will
to
turn
each
other
out
the
result
will
scarcely
be
forgotten
by
those
who
recognize
the
occasion
from
these
remarks
meanwhile
it
was
the
eve
of
battle
most
evenings
were
and
there
was
that
villain
with
the
horses
in
the
donga
and
here
were
we
two
upon
his
track
raffles
plan
was
to
reconnoitre
the
place
and
then
take
up
a
position
from
which
we
could
watch
our
man
and
pounce
upon
him
if
he
gave
us
cause
the
spot
that
we
eventually
chose
and
stealthily
occupied
was
behind
some
bushes
through
which
we
could
see
down
into
the
donga
there
were
the
precious
horses
and
there
sure
enough
was
our
wounded
corporal
sitting
smoking
in
his
cloak
some
glimmering
thing
in
his
lap
that
his
revolver
and
it
a
mauser
whispered
raffles
he
sha
have
a
chance
of
using
it
on
us
either
we
must
be
on
him
before
he
knows
we
are
anywhere
near
or
simply
report
it
easily
proved
once
we
are
sure
but
i
should
like
to
have
the
taking
of
him
too
there
was
a
setting
moon
shadows
were
sharp
and
black
the
man
smoked
steadily
and
the
hungry
horses
did
what
i
never
saw
horses
do
before
they
stood
and
nibbled
at
each
other
tails
i
was
used
to
sleeping
in
the
open
under
the
jewelled
dome
that
seems
so
much
vaster
and
grander
in
these
wide
spaces
of
the
earth
i
lay
listening
to
the
horses
and
to
the
myriad
small
strange
voices
of
the
veldt
to
which
i
can
not
even
now
put
a
name
while
raffles
watched
one
head
is
better
than
two
he
said
when
you
do
want
it
to
be
seen
we
were
to
take
watch
and
watch
about
however
and
the
other
might
sleep
if
he
could
it
was
not
my
fault
that
i
did
nothing
else
it
was
raffles
who
could
trust
nobody
but
himself
nor
was
there
any
time
for
recriminations
when
he
did
rouse
me
in
the
end
but
a
moment
ago
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
been
gazing
upward
at
the
stars
and
listening
to
the
dear
minute
sounds
of
peace
and
in
another
the
great
gray
slate
was
clean
and
every
bone
of
me
set
in
plaster
of
paris
and
sniping
beginning
between
pickets
with
the
day
it
was
an
occasional
crack
not
a
constant
crackle
but
the
whistle
of
a
bullet
as
it
passed
us
by
or
a
tiny
transitory
flame
for
the
one
bit
of
detail
on
a
blue
was
an
unpleasant
warning
that
we
two
on
ours
were
a
target
in
ourselves
but
raffles
paid
no
attention
to
their
fire
he
was
pointing
downward
through
the
bushes
to
where
corporal
connal
stood
with
his
back
to
us
shooing
a
last
charger
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
donga
towards
the
boer
trenches
that
his
third
whispered
raffles
but
it
the
first
i
seen
distinctly
for
he
waited
for
the
blind
spot
before
the
dawn
enough
to
land
him
i
fancy
but
we
must
lose
time
are
you
ready
for
a
creep
i
stretched
myself
and
said
i
was
but
i
devoutly
wished
it
was
not
quite
so
early
in
the
morning
like
cats
then
till
he
hears
and
then
into
him
for
all
we
worth
he
stowed
his
iron
safe
away
but
he
must
have
time
even
to
feel
for
it
you
take
his
left
arm
bunny
and
hang
on
to
that
like
a
ferret
and
i
do
the
rest
ready
then
now
and
in
less
time
than
it
would
take
to
tell
we
were
over
the
lip
of
the
donga
and
had
fallen
upon
the
fellow
before
he
could
turn
his
head
nevertheless
for
a
few
instants
he
fought
like
a
wild
beast
striking
kicking
and
swinging
me
off
my
feet
as
i
obeyed
my
instructions
to
the
letter
and
stuck
to
his
left
like
a
leech
but
he
soon
gave
that
up
panting
and
blaspheming
demanded
explanations
in
his
hybrid
tongue
that
had
half
a
brogue
and
half
a
burr
what
were
we
doing
what
had
he
done
raffles
at
his
back
with
his
right
wrist
twisted
round
and
pinned
into
the
small
of
it
soon
told
him
that
and
i
think
the
words
must
have
been
the
first
intimation
that
he
had
as
to
who
his
assailants
were
so
it
you
two
he
cried
and
a
light
broke
over
him
he
was
no
longer
trying
to
shake
us
off
and
now
he
dropped
his
curses
also
and
stood
chuckling
to
himself
instead
well
he
went
on
you
bloody
liars
both
but
i
know
something
else
that
you
are
so
you
better
let
go
a
coldness
ran
through
me
and
i
never
saw
raffles
so
taken
aback
his
grip
must
have
relaxed
for
a
fraction
of
time
for
our
captive
broke
out
in
a
fresh
and
desperate
struggle
but
now
we
pinned
him
tighter
than
ever
and
soon
i
saw
him
turning
green
and
yellow
with
the
pain
you
breaking
my
wrist
he
yelled
at
last
then
stand
still
and
tell
us
who
we
are
and
he
stood
still
and
told
us
our
real
names
but
raffles
insisted
on
hearing
how
he
had
found
us
out
and
smiled
as
though
he
had
known
what
was
coming
when
it
came
i
was
dumbfounded
the
accursed
hound
had
followed
us
that
evening
to
captain
tent
and
his
undoubted
cleverness
in
his
own
profession
of
spy
had
done
the
rest
and
now
you
better
let
me
go
said
the
master
of
the
situation
as
i
for
one
could
not
help
regarding
him
i
see
you
damned
said
raffles
savagely
then
you
damned
and
done
for
yourself
my
cocky
criminal
raffles
the
burglar
raffles
the
society
thief
not
dead
after
all
but
and
send
him
home
and
give
him
fourteen
years
and
wo
he
like
that
all
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
shot
first
retorted
raffles
through
his
teeth
and
that
alone
will
make
them
bearable
come
on
bunny
let
drive
the
swine
along
and
get
it
over
and
drive
him
we
did
he
cursing
cajoling
struggling
gloating
and
blubbering
by
turns
but
raffles
never
wavered
for
an
instant
though
his
face
was
tragic
and
it
went
to
my
heart
where
that
look
stays
still
i
remember
at
the
time
though
i
never
let
my
hold
relax
there
was
a
moment
when
i
added
my
entreaties
to
those
of
our
prisoner
raffles
did
not
even
reply
to
me
but
i
was
thinking
of
him
i
swear
i
was
thinking
of
that
gray
set
face
that
i
never
saw
before
or
after
your
story
will
be
tested
said
the
commanding
officer
when
connal
had
been
marched
to
the
is
there
any
truth
in
his
it
is
perfectly
true
sir
and
the
notorious
raffles
has
been
alive
all
these
years
and
you
are
really
he
i
am
sir
and
what
are
you
doing
at
the
front
somehow
i
thought
that
raffles
was
going
to
smile
but
the
grim
set
of
his
mouth
never
altered
neither
was
there
any
change
in
the
ashy
pallor
which
had
come
over
him
in
the
donga
when
connal
mouthed
his
name
it
was
only
his
eyes
that
lighted
up
at
the
last
question
i
am
fighting
sir
said
he
as
simply
as
any
subaltern
in
the
army
the
commanding
officer
inclined
a
grizzled
head
perceptibly
and
no
more
he
was
not
one
of
any
school
our
general
he
had
his
own
ways
and
we
loved
both
him
and
them
and
i
believe
that
he
loved
the
rough
but
gallant
corps
that
bore
his
name
he
once
told
us
that
he
knew
something
about
most
of
us
and
there
were
things
that
raffles
had
done
of
which
he
must
have
heard
but
he
only
moved
his
grizzled
head
did
you
know
he
was
going
to
give
you
away
he
asked
at
length
with
a
jerk
of
it
toward
the
yes
sir
but
you
thought
it
worth
while
did
you
i
thought
it
necessary
sir
the
general
paused
drumming
on
his
table
making
up
his
mind
then
his
chin
came
up
with
the
decision
that
we
loved
in
him
i
shall
sift
all
this
said
he
an
officer
name
was
mentioned
and
i
shall
see
him
myself
meanwhile
you
had
better
go
on
fighting
iv
corporal
connal
paid
the
penalty
of
his
crime
before
the
sun
was
far
above
the
hill
held
by
the
enemy
there
was
abundance
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
besides
the
direct
testimony
of
raffles
and
myself
and
the
wretch
was
shot
at
last
with
little
ceremony
and
less
shrift
and
that
was
the
one
good
thing
that
happened
on
the
day
that
broke
upon
us
hiding
behind
the
bushes
overlooking
the
donga
by
noon
it
was
my
own
turn
i
have
avoided
speaking
of
my
wound
before
i
need
and
from
the
preceding
pages
you
would
not
gather
that
i
am
more
or
less
lame
for
life
you
will
soon
see
now
why
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
recall
the
incident
i
used
to
think
of
a
wound
received
in
one
service
as
the
proudest
trophy
a
man
could
acquire
but
the
sight
of
mine
depresses
me
every
morning
of
my
life
it
was
due
for
one
thing
to
my
own
slow
eye
for
cover
in
taking
which
to
aggravate
my
case
our
hardy
little
corps
happened
to
excel
the
bullet
went
clean
through
my
thigh
drilling
the
bone
but
happily
missing
the
sciatic
nerve
thus
the
mere
pain
was
less
than
it
might
have
been
but
of
course
i
went
over
in
a
heap
we
were
advancing
on
our
stomachs
to
take
the
hill
and
thus
extend
our
position
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
fire
became
too
heavy
for
us
so
that
for
hours
in
the
event
we
moved
neither
forward
nor
back
but
it
was
not
a
minute
before
raffles
came
to
me
through
the
whistling
scud
and
in
another
i
was
on
my
back
behind
a
shallow
rock
with
him
kneeling
over
me
and
unrolling
my
bandage
in
the
teeth
of
that
murderous
fire
it
was
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
he
said
when
i
begged
him
to
bend
lower
but
for
the
moment
i
thought
his
tone
as
changed
as
his
face
had
been
earlier
in
the
morning
to
oblige
me
however
he
took
more
care
and
when
he
had
done
all
that
one
comrade
could
for
another
he
did
avail
himself
of
the
cover
he
had
found
for
me
so
there
we
lay
together
on
the
veldt
under
blinding
sun
and
withering
fire
and
i
suppose
it
is
the
veldt
that
i
should
describe
as
it
swims
and
flickers
before
wounded
eyes
i
shut
mine
to
bring
it
back
but
all
that
comes
is
the
keen
brown
face
of
raffles
still
a
shade
paler
than
its
wont
now
bending
to
sight
and
fire
now
peering
to
see
results
brows
raised
eyes
widened
anon
turning
to
me
with
the
word
to
set
my
tight
lips
grinning
he
was
talking
all
the
time
but
for
my
sake
and
i
knew
it
can
you
wonder
that
i
could
not
see
an
inch
beyond
him
he
was
the
battle
to
me
then
he
is
the
whole
war
to
me
as
i
look
back
now
feel
equal
to
a
cigarette
it
will
buck
you
up
bunny
no
that
one
in
the
silver
paper
i
hoarded
it
for
this
here
a
light
and
so
bunny
takes
the
sullivan
all
honor
to
the
sporting
rabbit
at
least
i
went
over
like
one
said
i
sending
the
only
clouds
into
the
blue
and
chiefly
wishing
for
their
longer
endurance
i
was
as
hot
as
a
cinder
from
my
head
to
one
foot
the
other
leg
was
ceasing
to
belong
to
me
wait
a
bit
says
raffles
puckering
there
a
gray
felt
hat
at
deep
and
i
want
to
add
it
to
the
bag
for
vengeance
wait
yes
no
no
luck
i
must
pitch
up
a
bit
more
hallo
magazine
empty
how
goes
the
sullivan
bunny
rum
to
be
smoking
one
on
the
veldt
with
a
hole
in
your
leg
it
doing
me
good
i
said
and
i
believe
it
was
but
raffles
lay
looking
at
me
as
he
lightened
his
bandolier
do
you
remember
he
said
softly
the
day
we
first
began
to
think
about
the
war
i
can
see
the
pink
misty
river
light
and
feel
the
first
bite
there
was
in
the
air
when
one
stood
about
do
you
wish
we
had
either
here
slorter
orful
slorter
that
fellow
face
i
see
it
too
and
here
we
have
the
thing
he
cried
can
you
believe
only
six
months
ago
yes
i
sighed
enjoying
the
thought
of
that
afternoon
less
than
he
did
yes
we
were
slow
to
catch
fire
at
first
too
slow
he
said
quickly
but
when
we
did
catch
i
went
on
wishing
we
never
had
we
soon
burnt
up
and
then
went
out
laughed
raffles
gayly
he
was
loaded
up
again
another
over
at
the
gray
felt
hat
said
he
by
jove
though
i
believe
he
having
an
over
at
me
i
wish
you
be
careful
i
urged
i
heard
it
too
my
dear
bunny
it
on
the
knees
you
wot
of
if
anything
down
in
the
specifications
surely
that
is
besides
that
was
nearer
to
you
no
to
him
poor
devil
he
has
his
specifications
too
comforting
to
think
that
i
ca
see
where
that
one
pitched
it
may
have
been
a
wide
and
it
very
nearly
the
end
of
the
over
again
feeling
worse
bunny
no
i
only
closed
my
eyes
go
on
talking
it
was
i
who
let
you
in
for
this
he
said
at
his
bandolier
again
no
i
glad
i
came
out
and
i
believe
i
still
was
in
a
way
for
it
was
rather
fine
to
be
wounded
just
then
with
the
pain
growing
less
but
the
sensation
was
not
to
last
me
many
minutes
and
i
can
truthfully
say
that
i
have
never
felt
it
since
ah
but
you
have
had
such
a
good
time
as
i
have
perhaps
not
had
his
voice
vibrated
or
had
i
imagined
it
and
loss
of
blood
were
playing
tricks
with
my
senses
now
they
were
quite
dull
and
my
leg
alive
and
throbbing
now
i
had
no
leg
at
all
but
more
than
all
my
ordinary
senses
in
every
other
part
of
me
and
the
orchestra
was
playing
all
the
time
and
all
around
me
on
every
class
of
fiendish
instrument
which
you
have
been
made
to
hear
for
yourselves
in
every
newspaper
yet
all
that
i
heard
was
raffles
talking
i
have
had
a
good
time
bunny
yes
his
voice
was
sad
but
that
was
all
the
vibration
must
have
been
in
me
i
know
you
have
old
chap
said
i
i
am
grateful
to
the
general
for
giving
me
it
may
be
the
last
then
i
can
only
say
it
been
the
best
by
jove
what
is
it
and
i
opened
my
eyes
his
were
shining
i
can
see
them
now
got
him
got
the
hat
no
i
hanged
if
i
have
at
least
he
was
in
it
the
crafty
cuss
he
must
have
stuck
it
up
on
purpose
another
over
scoring
slow
i
wonder
if
he
sportsman
enough
to
take
a
hint
his
foolish
will
he
show
his
face
if
i
show
mine
i
lay
with
closed
ears
and
eyes
my
leg
had
come
to
life
again
and
the
rest
of
me
was
numb
bunny
his
voice
sounded
higher
he
must
have
been
sitting
upright
well
but
it
was
not
well
with
me
that
was
all
i
thought
as
my
lips
made
the
word
it
not
only
been
the
best
time
i
ever
had
old
bunny
but
i
not
half
sure
of
what
i
can
but
guess
the
sentence
was
not
finished
and
never
could
be
in
this
world
