chapter
i
i
had
always
suspected
the
geographical
authorities
did
not
know
what
they
were
talking
about
when
they
located
the
battlefield
of
munda
in
the
county
of
the
close
to
the
modern
monda
some
two
leagues
north
of
marbella
according
to
my
own
surmise
founded
on
the
text
of
the
anonymous
author
of
the
and
on
certain
information
culled
from
the
excellent
library
owned
by
the
duke
of
ossuna
i
believed
the
site
of
the
memorable
struggle
in
which
caesar
played
double
or
quits
once
and
for
all
with
the
champions
of
the
republic
should
be
sought
in
the
neighbourhood
of
montilla
happening
to
be
in
andalusia
during
the
autumn
of
i
made
a
somewhat
lengthy
excursion
with
the
object
of
clearing
up
certain
doubts
which
still
oppressed
me
a
paper
which
i
shall
shortly
publish
will
i
trust
remove
any
hesitation
that
may
still
exist
in
the
minds
of
all
honest
archaeologists
but
before
that
dissertation
of
mine
finally
settles
the
geographical
problem
on
the
solution
of
which
the
whole
of
learned
europe
hangs
i
desire
to
relate
a
little
tale
it
will
do
no
prejudice
to
the
interesting
question
of
the
correct
locality
of
monda
i
had
hired
a
guide
and
a
couple
of
horses
at
cordova
and
had
started
on
my
way
with
no
luggage
save
a
few
shirts
and
caesar
s
as
i
wandered
one
day
across
the
higher
lands
of
the
cachena
plain
worn
with
fatigue
parched
with
thirst
scorched
by
a
burning
sun
cursing
caesar
and
pompey
s
sons
alike
most
heartily
my
eye
lighted
at
some
distance
from
the
path
i
was
following
on
a
little
stretch
of
green
sward
dotted
with
reeds
and
rushes
that
betokened
the
neighbourhood
of
some
spring
and
indeed
as
i
drew
nearer
i
perceived
that
what
had
looked
like
sward
was
a
marsh
into
which
a
stream
which
seemed
to
issue
from
a
narrow
gorge
between
two
high
spurs
of
the
sierra
di
cabra
ran
and
disappeared
if
i
rode
up
that
stream
i
argued
i
was
likely
to
find
cooler
water
fewer
leeches
and
frogs
and
mayhap
a
little
shade
among
the
rocks
at
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
my
horse
neighed
and
another
horse
invisible
to
me
neighed
back
before
i
had
advanced
a
hundred
paces
the
gorge
suddenly
widened
and
i
beheld
a
sort
of
natural
amphitheatre
thoroughly
shaded
by
the
steep
cliffs
that
lay
all
around
it
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
any
more
delightful
halting
place
for
a
traveller
at
the
foot
of
the
precipitous
rocks
the
stream
bubbled
upward
and
fell
into
a
little
basin
lined
with
sand
that
was
as
white
as
snow
five
or
six
splendid
evergreen
oaks
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
cooled
by
the
spring
grew
beside
the
pool
and
shaded
it
with
their
thick
foliage
and
round
about
it
a
close
and
glossy
turf
offered
the
wanderer
a
better
bed
than
he
could
have
found
in
any
hostelry
for
ten
leagues
round
the
honour
of
discovering
this
fair
spot
did
not
belong
to
me
a
man
was
resting
there
already
sleeping
no
doubt
before
i
reached
it
roused
by
the
neighing
of
the
horses
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
had
moved
over
to
his
mount
which
had
been
taking
advantage
of
its
master
s
slumbers
to
make
a
hearty
feed
on
the
grass
that
grew
around
he
was
an
active
young
fellow
of
middle
height
but
powerful
in
build
and
proud
and
in
expression
his
complexion
which
may
once
have
been
fine
had
been
tanned
by
the
sun
till
it
was
darker
than
his
hair
one
of
his
hands
grasped
his
horse
s
halter
in
the
other
he
held
a
brass
blunderbuss
at
the
first
blush
i
confess
the
blunderbuss
and
the
savage
looks
of
the
man
who
bore
it
somewhat
took
me
aback
but
i
had
heard
so
much
about
robbers
that
never
seeing
any
i
had
ceased
to
believe
in
their
existence
and
further
i
had
seen
so
many
honest
farmers
arm
themselves
to
the
teeth
before
they
went
out
to
market
that
the
sight
of
firearms
gave
me
no
warrant
for
doubting
the
character
of
any
stranger
and
then
quoth
i
to
myself
what
could
he
do
with
my
shirts
and
my
elzevir
edition
of
caesar
s
so
i
bestowed
a
friendly
nod
on
the
man
with
the
blunderbuss
and
inquired
with
a
smile
whether
i
had
disturbed
his
nap
without
any
answer
he
looked
me
over
from
head
to
foot
then
as
if
the
scrutiny
had
satisfied
him
he
looked
as
closely
at
my
guide
who
was
just
coming
up
i
saw
the
guide
turn
pale
and
pull
up
with
an
air
of
evident
alarm
an
unlucky
meeting
thought
i
to
myself
but
prudence
instantly
counselled
me
not
to
let
any
symptom
of
anxiety
escape
me
so
i
dismounted
i
told
the
guide
to
take
off
the
horses
bridles
and
kneeling
down
beside
the
spring
i
laved
my
head
and
hands
and
then
drank
a
long
draught
lying
flat
on
my
belly
like
gideon
s
soldiers
meanwhile
i
watched
the
stranger
and
my
own
guide
this
last
seemed
to
come
forward
unwillingly
but
the
other
did
not
appear
to
have
any
evil
designs
upon
us
for
he
had
turned
his
horse
loose
and
the
blunderbuss
which
he
had
been
holding
horizontally
was
now
dropped
earthward
not
thinking
it
necessary
to
take
offence
at
the
scant
attention
paid
me
i
stretched
myself
full
length
upon
the
grass
and
calmly
asked
the
owner
of
the
blunderbuss
whether
he
had
a
light
about
him
at
the
same
time
i
pulled
out
my
the
stranger
still
without
opening
his
lips
took
out
his
flint
and
lost
no
time
in
getting
me
a
light
he
was
evidently
growing
tamer
for
he
sat
down
opposite
to
me
though
he
still
grasped
his
weapon
when
i
had
lighted
my
cigar
i
chose
out
the
best
i
had
left
and
asked
him
whether
he
smoked
yes
senor
he
replied
these
were
the
first
words
i
had
heard
him
speak
and
i
noticed
that
he
did
not
pronounce
the
letter
in
the
andalusian
fashion
whence
i
concluded
he
was
a
traveller
like
myself
though
maybe
somewhat
less
of
an
archaeologist
the
andalusians
aspirate
the
and
pronounce
it
like
the
soft
and
the
which
spaniards
pronounce
like
the
english
an
andalusian
may
always
be
recognised
by
the
way
in
which
he
says
you
ll
find
this
a
fairly
good
one
said
i
holding
out
a
real
havana
regalia
he
bowed
his
head
slightly
lighted
his
cigar
at
mine
thanked
me
with
another
nod
and
began
to
smoke
with
a
most
lively
appearance
of
enjoyment
ah
he
exclaimed
as
he
blew
his
first
puff
of
smoke
slowly
out
of
his
ears
and
nostrils
what
a
time
it
is
since
i
ve
had
a
smoke
in
spain
the
giving
and
accepting
of
a
cigar
establishes
bonds
of
hospitality
similar
to
those
founded
in
eastern
countries
on
the
partaking
of
bread
and
salt
my
friend
turned
out
more
talkative
than
i
had
hoped
however
though
he
claimed
to
belong
to
the
of
montilla
he
seemed
very
about
the
country
he
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
delightful
valley
in
which
we
were
sitting
he
could
not
tell
me
the
names
of
any
of
the
neighbouring
villages
and
when
i
inquired
whether
he
had
not
noticed
any
walls
tiles
or
carved
stones
in
the
vicinity
he
confessed
he
had
never
paid
any
heed
to
such
matters
on
the
other
hand
he
showed
himself
an
expert
in
horseflesh
found
fault
with
my
mount
not
a
difficult
affair
and
gave
me
a
pedigree
of
his
own
which
had
come
from
the
famous
stud
at
cordova
it
was
a
splendid
creature
indeed
so
tough
according
to
its
owner
s
claim
that
it
had
once
covered
thirty
leagues
in
one
day
either
at
the
gallop
or
at
full
trot
the
whole
time
in
the
midst
of
his
story
the
stranger
pulled
up
short
as
if
startled
and
sorry
he
had
said
so
much
the
fact
is
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
to
cordova
he
went
on
somewhat
embarrassed
i
had
to
petition
the
judges
about
a
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
my
guide
antonio
who
had
dropped
his
eyes
the
spring
and
the
cool
shade
were
so
delightful
that
i
bethought
me
of
certain
slices
of
an
excellent
ham
which
my
friends
at
montilla
had
packed
into
my
guide
s
wallet
i
bade
him
produce
them
and
invited
the
stranger
to
share
our
impromptu
lunch
if
he
had
not
smoked
for
a
long
time
he
certainly
struck
me
as
having
fasted
for
hours
at
the
very
least
he
ate
like
a
starving
wolf
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
my
appearance
must
really
have
been
quite
providential
for
the
poor
fellow
meanwhile
my
guide
ate
but
little
drank
still
less
and
spoke
never
a
word
although
in
the
earlier
part
of
our
journey
he
had
proved
himself
a
most
unrivalled
chatterer
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
our
guest
and
a
sort
of
mutual
distrust
the
cause
of
which
i
could
not
exactly
fathom
seemed
to
be
between
them
the
last
crumbs
of
bread
and
scraps
of
ham
had
disappeared
we
had
each
smoked
our
second
cigar
i
told
the
guide
to
bridle
the
horses
and
was
just
about
to
take
leave
of
my
new
friend
when
he
inquired
where
i
was
going
to
spend
the
night
before
i
had
time
to
notice
a
sign
my
guide
was
making
to
me
i
had
replied
that
i
was
going
to
the
venta
del
cuervo
that
s
a
bad
lodging
for
a
gentleman
like
you
sir
i
m
bound
there
myself
and
if
you
ll
allow
me
to
ride
with
you
we
ll
go
with
pleasure
i
replied
mounting
my
horse
the
guide
who
was
holding
my
stirrup
looked
at
me
meaningly
again
i
answered
by
shrugging
my
shoulders
as
though
to
assure
him
i
was
perfectly
easy
in
my
mind
and
we
started
on
our
way
antonio
s
mysterious
signals
his
evident
anxiety
a
few
words
dropped
by
the
stranger
above
all
his
ride
of
thirty
leagues
and
the
far
from
plausible
explanation
he
had
given
us
of
it
had
already
enabled
me
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
identity
of
my
i
had
no
doubt
at
all
i
was
in
the
company
of
a
smuggler
and
possibly
of
a
brigand
what
cared
i
i
knew
enough
of
the
spanish
character
to
be
very
certain
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
a
man
who
had
eaten
and
smoked
with
me
his
very
presence
would
protect
me
in
case
of
any
undesirable
meeting
and
besides
i
was
very
glad
to
know
what
a
brigand
was
really
like
one
doesn
t
come
across
such
gentry
every
day
and
there
is
a
certain
charm
about
finding
one
s
self
in
close
proximity
to
a
dangerous
being
especially
when
one
feels
the
being
in
question
to
be
gentle
and
tame
i
was
hoping
the
stranger
might
gradually
fall
into
a
confidential
mood
and
in
spite
of
my
guide
s
winks
i
turned
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
highwaymen
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
spoke
of
them
with
great
respect
at
that
time
there
was
a
famous
brigand
in
andalusia
of
the
name
of
whose
exploits
were
on
every
lip
supposing
i
should
be
riding
along
with
said
i
to
myself
i
told
all
the
stories
i
knew
about
the
hero
they
were
all
to
his
credit
indeed
and
loudly
expressed
my
admiration
of
his
generosity
and
his
valour
is
nothing
but
a
blackguard
said
the
stranger
gravely
is
he
just
to
himself
or
is
this
an
excess
of
modesty
i
queried
mentally
for
by
dint
of
scrutinizing
my
companion
i
had
ended
by
reconciling
his
appearance
with
the
description
of
which
i
read
posted
up
on
the
gates
of
various
andalusian
towns
yes
this
must
be
he
fair
hair
blue
eyes
large
mouth
good
teeth
small
hands
fine
shirt
a
velvet
jacket
with
silver
buttons
on
it
white
leather
gaiters
and
a
bay
horse
not
a
doubt
about
it
but
his
shall
be
respected
we
reached
the
it
was
just
what
he
had
described
to
me
in
other
words
the
most
wretched
hole
of
its
kind
i
had
as
yet
beheld
one
large
apartment
served
as
kitchen
and
sleeping
chamber
a
fire
was
burning
on
a
flat
stone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
the
smoke
escaped
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
or
rather
hung
in
a
cloud
some
feet
above
the
soil
along
the
walls
five
or
six
mule
rugs
were
spread
on
the
floor
these
were
the
travellers
beds
twenty
paces
from
the
house
or
rather
from
the
solitary
apartment
which
i
have
just
described
stood
a
sort
of
shed
that
served
for
a
stable
the
only
inhabitants
of
this
delightful
dwelling
visible
at
the
moment
at
all
events
were
an
old
woman
and
a
little
girl
of
ten
or
twelve
years
old
both
of
them
as
black
as
soot
and
dressed
in
loathsome
rags
here
s
the
sole
remnant
of
the
ancient
populations
of
munda
boetica
said
i
to
myself
o
caesar
o
sextus
pompeius
if
you
were
to
revisit
this
earth
how
astounded
you
would
be
when
the
old
woman
saw
my
travelling
companion
an
exclamation
of
surprise
escaped
her
ah
senor
don
jose
she
cried
don
jose
frowned
and
lifted
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
authority
that
forthwith
silenced
the
old
dame
i
turned
to
my
guide
and
gave
him
to
understand
by
a
sign
that
no
one
else
perceived
that
i
knew
all
about
the
man
in
whose
company
i
was
about
to
spend
the
night
our
supper
was
better
than
i
expected
on
a
little
table
only
a
foot
high
we
were
served
with
an
old
rooster
fricasseed
with
rice
and
numerous
peppers
then
more
peppers
in
oil
and
finally
a
a
sort
of
salad
made
of
peppers
these
three
highly
spiced
dishes
involved
our
frequent
recourse
to
a
goatskin
filled
with
montella
wine
which
struck
us
as
being
delicious
after
our
meal
was
over
i
caught
sight
of
a
mandolin
hanging
up
against
the
wall
in
spain
you
see
mandolins
in
every
corner
and
i
asked
the
little
girl
who
had
been
waiting
on
us
if
she
knew
how
to
play
it
no
she
replied
but
don
jose
does
play
well
do
me
the
kindness
to
sing
me
something
i
said
to
him
i
m
passionately
fond
of
your
national
i
can
t
refuse
to
do
anything
for
such
a
charming
gentleman
who
gives
me
such
excellent
cigars
responded
don
jose
gaily
and
having
made
the
child
give
him
the
mandolin
he
sang
to
his
own
accompaniment
his
voice
though
rough
was
pleasing
the
air
he
sang
was
strange
and
sad
as
to
the
words
i
could
not
understand
a
single
one
of
them
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
i
that
s
not
a
spanish
air
you
have
just
been
singing
it
s
like
the
i
ve
heard
in
the
provinces
and
the
words
must
be
in
the
basque
the
alava
biscay
guipuzcoa
and
a
part
of
navarre
which
all
enjoy
special
the
basque
language
is
spoken
in
these
countries
yes
said
don
jose
with
a
gloomy
look
he
laid
the
mandolin
down
on
the
ground
and
began
staring
with
a
peculiarly
sad
expression
at
the
dying
fire
his
face
at
once
fierce
and
reminded
me
as
the
firelight
fell
on
it
of
milton
s
satan
like
him
perchance
my
comrade
was
musing
over
the
home
he
had
forfeited
the
exile
he
had
earned
by
some
misdeed
i
tried
to
revive
the
conversation
but
so
absorbed
was
he
in
melancholy
thought
that
he
gave
me
no
answer
the
old
woman
had
already
gone
to
rest
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
a
ragged
rug
hung
on
a
rope
the
little
girl
had
followed
her
into
this
retreat
sacred
to
the
fair
sex
then
my
guide
rose
and
suggested
that
i
should
go
with
him
to
the
stable
but
at
the
word
don
jose
waking
as
it
were
with
a
start
inquired
sharply
whither
he
was
going
to
the
stable
answered
the
guide
what
for
the
horses
have
been
fed
you
can
sleep
here
the
senor
will
give
you
i
m
afraid
the
senor
s
horse
is
sick
i
d
like
the
senor
to
see
it
perhaps
he
d
know
what
should
be
done
for
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
that
antonio
wanted
to
speak
to
me
apart
but
i
did
not
care
to
rouse
don
jose
s
suspicions
and
being
as
we
were
i
thought
far
the
wisest
course
for
me
was
to
appear
absolutely
confident
i
therefore
told
antonio
that
i
knew
nothing
on
earth
about
horses
and
that
i
was
desperately
sleepy
don
jose
followed
him
to
the
stable
and
soon
returned
alone
he
told
me
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
the
horse
but
that
my
guide
considered
the
animal
such
a
treasure
that
he
was
scrubbing
it
with
his
jacket
to
make
it
sweat
and
expected
to
spend
the
night
in
that
pleasing
occupation
meanwhile
i
had
stretched
myself
out
on
the
mule
rugs
having
carefully
wrapped
myself
up
in
my
own
cloak
so
as
to
avoid
touching
them
don
jose
having
begged
me
to
excuse
the
liberty
he
took
in
placing
himself
so
near
me
lay
down
across
the
door
but
not
until
he
had
primed
his
blunderbuss
afresh
and
carefully
laid
it
under
the
wallet
which
served
him
as
a
pillow
i
had
thought
i
was
so
tired
that
i
should
be
able
to
sleep
even
in
such
a
lodging
but
within
an
hour
a
most
unpleasant
itching
sensation
roused
me
from
my
first
nap
as
soon
as
i
realized
its
nature
i
rose
to
my
feet
feeling
convinced
i
should
do
far
better
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
open
air
than
beneath
that
inhospitable
roof
walking
tiptoe
i
reached
the
door
stepped
over
don
jose
who
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
managed
so
well
that
i
got
outside
the
building
without
waking
him
just
beside
the
door
there
was
a
wide
wooden
bench
i
lay
down
upon
it
and
settled
myself
as
best
i
could
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
was
just
closing
my
eyes
for
a
second
time
when
i
fancied
i
saw
the
shadow
of
a
man
and
then
the
shadow
of
a
horse
moving
absolutely
noiselessly
one
behind
the
other
i
sat
upright
and
then
i
thought
i
recognised
antonio
surprised
to
see
him
outside
the
stable
at
such
an
hour
i
got
up
and
went
toward
him
he
had
seen
me
first
and
had
stopped
to
wait
for
me
where
is
he
antonio
inquired
in
a
low
tone
in
the
he
s
asleep
the
bugs
don
t
trouble
him
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
horse
i
then
noticed
that
to
stifle
all
noise
as
he
moved
out
of
the
shed
antonio
had
carefully
muffled
the
horse
s
feet
in
the
rags
of
an
old
blanket
speak
lower
for
god
s
sake
said
antonio
you
don
t
know
who
that
man
is
he
s
jose
navarro
the
most
noted
bandit
in
andalusia
i
ve
been
making
signs
to
you
all
day
long
and
you
wouldn
t
what
do
i
care
whether
he
s
a
brigand
or
not
i
replied
he
hasn
t
robbed
us
and
i
ll
wager
he
doesn
t
want
that
may
be
but
there
are
two
hundred
ducats
on
his
head
some
lancers
are
stationed
in
a
place
i
know
a
league
and
a
half
from
here
and
before
daybreak
i
ll
bring
a
few
brawny
fellows
back
with
me
i
d
have
taken
his
horse
away
but
the
brute
s
so
savage
that
nobody
but
navarro
can
go
near
devil
take
you
i
cried
what
harm
has
the
poor
fellow
done
you
that
you
should
want
to
inform
against
him
and
besides
are
you
certain
he
is
the
brigand
you
take
him
for
perfectly
certain
he
came
after
me
into
the
stable
just
now
and
said
you
seem
to
know
me
if
you
tell
that
good
gentleman
who
i
am
i
ll
blow
your
brains
out
you
stay
here
sir
keep
close
to
him
you
ve
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
he
knows
you
are
there
he
won
t
suspect
as
we
talked
we
had
moved
so
far
from
the
that
the
noise
of
the
horse
s
hoofs
could
not
be
heard
there
in
a
twinkling
antonio
snatched
off
the
rags
he
had
wrapped
around
the
creature
s
feet
and
was
just
about
to
climb
on
its
back
in
vain
did
i
attempt
with
prayers
and
threats
to
restrain
him
i
m
only
a
poor
man
senor
quoth
he
i
can
t
afford
to
lose
two
hundred
ducats
especially
when
i
shall
earn
them
by
ridding
the
country
of
such
vermin
but
mind
what
you
re
about
if
navarro
wakes
up
he
ll
snatch
at
his
blunderbuss
and
then
look
out
for
yourself
i
ve
gone
too
far
now
to
turn
back
do
the
best
you
can
for
yourself
the
villain
was
in
his
saddle
already
he
spurred
his
horse
smartly
and
i
soon
lost
sight
of
them
both
in
the
darkness
i
was
very
angry
with
my
guide
and
terribly
alarmed
as
well
after
a
moment
s
reflection
i
made
up
my
mind
and
went
back
to
the
don
jose
was
still
sound
asleep
making
up
no
doubt
for
the
fatigue
and
sleeplessness
of
several
days
of
adventure
i
had
to
shake
him
roughly
before
i
could
wake
him
up
never
shall
i
forget
his
fierce
look
and
the
spring
he
made
to
get
hold
of
his
blunderbuss
which
as
a
precautionary
measure
i
had
removed
to
some
distance
from
his
couch
senor
i
said
i
beg
your
pardon
for
disturbing
you
but
i
have
a
silly
question
to
ask
you
would
you
be
glad
to
see
half
a
dozen
lancers
walk
in
here
he
bounded
to
his
feet
and
in
an
awful
voice
he
demanded
who
told
you
it
s
little
matter
whence
the
warning
comes
so
long
as
it
be
your
guide
has
betrayed
me
but
he
shall
pay
for
it
where
is
he
i
don
t
know
in
the
stable
i
fancy
but
somebody
told
me
who
told
you
it
can
t
be
the
old
hag
some
one
i
don
t
know
without
more
parleying
tell
me
yes
or
no
have
you
any
reason
for
not
waiting
till
the
soldiers
come
if
you
have
any
lose
no
time
if
not
to
you
and
forgive
me
for
having
disturbed
your
slumbers
ah
your
guide
your
guide
i
had
my
doubts
of
him
at
first
but
i
ll
settle
with
him
farewell
senor
may
god
reward
you
for
the
service
i
owe
you
i
am
not
quite
so
wicked
as
you
think
me
yes
i
still
have
something
in
me
that
an
honest
man
may
pity
farewell
senor
i
have
only
one
regret
that
i
can
not
pay
my
debt
to
you
as
a
reward
for
the
service
i
have
done
you
don
jose
promise
me
you
ll
suspect
nobody
nor
seek
for
vengeance
here
are
some
cigars
for
your
journey
good
luck
to
and
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
he
squeezed
it
without
a
word
took
up
his
wallet
and
blunderbuss
and
after
saying
a
few
words
to
the
old
woman
in
a
lingo
that
i
could
not
understand
he
ran
out
to
the
shed
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
him
galloping
out
into
the
country
as
for
me
i
lay
down
again
on
my
bench
but
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
again
i
queried
in
my
own
mind
whether
i
had
done
right
to
save
a
robber
and
possibly
a
murderer
from
the
gallows
simply
and
solely
because
i
had
eaten
ham
and
rice
in
his
company
had
i
not
betrayed
my
guide
who
was
supporting
the
cause
of
law
and
order
had
i
not
exposed
him
to
a
ruffian
s
vengeance
but
then
what
about
the
laws
of
hospitality
a
mere
savage
prejudice
said
i
to
myself
i
shall
have
to
answer
for
all
the
crimes
this
brigand
may
commit
in
yet
is
that
instinct
of
the
conscience
which
resists
every
argument
really
a
prejudice
it
may
be
i
could
not
have
escaped
from
the
delicate
position
in
which
i
found
myself
without
remorse
of
some
kind
i
was
still
tossed
to
and
fro
in
the
greatest
uncertainty
as
to
the
morality
of
my
behaviour
when
i
saw
half
a
dozen
horsemen
ride
up
with
antonio
prudently
lagging
behind
them
i
went
to
meet
them
and
told
them
the
brigand
had
fled
over
two
hours
previously
the
old
woman
when
she
was
questioned
by
the
sergeant
admitted
that
she
knew
navarro
but
said
that
living
alone
as
she
did
she
would
never
have
dared
to
risk
her
life
by
informing
against
him
she
added
that
when
he
came
to
her
house
he
habitually
went
away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
for
my
part
was
made
to
ride
to
a
place
some
leagues
away
where
i
showed
my
passport
and
signed
a
declaration
before
the
this
done
i
was
allowed
to
recommence
my
archaeological
investigations
antonio
was
sulky
with
me
suspecting
it
was
i
who
had
prevented
his
earning
those
two
hundred
ducats
nevertheless
we
parted
good
friends
at
cordova
where
i
gave
him
as
large
a
gratuity
as
the
state
of
my
finances
would
permit
chapter
ii
i
spent
several
days
at
cordova
i
had
been
told
of
a
certain
manuscript
in
the
library
of
the
dominican
convent
which
was
likely
to
furnish
me
with
very
interesting
details
about
the
ancient
munda
the
good
fathers
gave
me
the
most
kindly
welcome
i
spent
the
daylight
hours
within
their
convent
and
at
night
i
walked
about
the
town
at
cordova
a
great
many
idlers
collect
toward
sunset
in
the
quay
that
runs
along
the
right
bank
of
the
guadalquivir
promenaders
on
the
spot
have
to
breathe
the
odour
of
a
tan
yard
which
still
keeps
up
the
ancient
fame
of
the
country
in
connection
with
the
curing
of
leather
but
to
atone
for
this
they
enjoy
a
sight
which
has
a
charm
of
its
own
a
few
minutes
before
the
angelus
bell
rings
a
great
company
of
women
gathers
beside
the
river
just
below
the
quay
which
is
rather
a
high
one
not
a
man
would
dare
to
join
its
ranks
the
moment
the
angelus
rings
darkness
is
supposed
to
have
fallen
as
the
last
stroke
sounds
all
the
women
disrobe
and
step
into
the
water
then
there
is
laughing
and
screaming
and
a
wonderful
clatter
the
men
on
the
upper
quay
watch
the
bathers
straining
their
eyes
and
seeing
very
little
yet
the
white
uncertain
outlines
perceptible
against
the
waters
of
the
stream
stir
the
poetic
mind
and
the
possessor
of
a
little
fancy
finds
it
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
diana
and
her
nymphs
are
bathing
below
while
he
himself
runs
no
risk
of
ending
like
acteon
i
have
been
told
that
one
day
a
party
of
fellows
banded
themselves
together
and
bribed
the
at
the
cathedral
to
ring
the
angelus
some
twenty
minutes
before
the
proper
hour
though
it
was
still
broad
daylight
the
nymphs
of
the
guadalquivir
never
hesitated
and
putting
far
more
trust
in
the
angelus
bell
than
in
the
sun
they
proceeded
to
their
bathing
toilette
always
of
the
simplest
with
an
easy
conscience
i
was
not
present
on
that
occasion
in
my
day
the
was
incorruptible
the
twilight
was
very
dim
and
nobody
but
a
cat
could
have
distinguished
the
difference
between
the
oldest
orange
woman
and
the
prettiest
in
cordova
one
evening
after
it
had
grown
quite
dusk
i
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
quay
smoking
when
a
woman
came
up
the
steps
leading
from
the
river
and
sat
down
near
me
in
her
hair
she
wore
a
great
bunch
of
jasmine
a
flower
which
at
night
exhales
a
most
intoxicating
perfume
she
was
dressed
simply
almost
poorly
in
black
as
most
are
dressed
in
the
evening
women
of
the
richer
class
only
wear
black
in
the
daytime
at
night
they
dress
la
when
she
drew
near
me
the
woman
let
the
mantilla
which
had
covered
her
head
drop
on
her
shoulders
and
by
the
dim
light
falling
from
the
stars
i
perceived
her
to
be
young
short
in
stature
and
with
very
large
eyes
i
threw
my
cigar
away
at
once
she
appreciated
this
mark
of
courtesy
essentially
french
and
hastened
to
inform
me
that
she
was
very
fond
of
the
smell
of
tobacco
and
that
she
even
smoked
herself
when
she
could
get
very
mild
i
fortunately
happened
to
have
some
such
in
my
case
and
at
once
offered
them
to
her
she
condescended
to
take
one
and
lighted
it
at
a
burning
string
which
a
child
brought
us
receiving
a
copper
for
its
pains
we
mingled
our
smoke
and
talked
so
long
the
fair
lady
and
i
that
we
ended
by
being
almost
alone
on
the
quay
i
thought
i
might
venture
without
impropriety
to
suggest
our
going
to
eat
an
ice
at
the
after
a
moment
of
modest
demur
she
agreed
but
before
finally
accepting
she
desired
to
know
what
o
clock
it
was
i
struck
my
repeater
and
this
seemed
to
astound
her
greatly
a
to
which
a
depot
of
ice
or
rather
of
snow
is
attached
there
is
hardly
a
village
in
spain
without
its
what
clever
inventions
you
foreigners
do
have
what
country
do
you
belong
to
sir
you
re
an
englishman
no
doubt
every
traveller
in
spain
who
does
not
carry
about
samples
of
calicoes
and
silks
is
taken
for
an
englishman
it
is
the
same
thing
in
the
east
i
m
a
frenchman
and
your
devoted
servant
and
you
senora
or
senorita
you
probably
belong
to
cordova
at
all
events
you
are
an
andalusian
your
soft
way
of
speaking
makes
me
think
if
you
notice
people
s
accent
so
closely
you
must
be
able
to
guess
what
i
i
think
you
are
from
the
country
of
jesus
two
paces
out
of
i
had
learned
the
metaphor
which
stands
for
andalusia
from
my
friend
francisco
sevilla
a
pshaw
the
people
here
say
there
is
no
place
in
paradise
for
us
then
perhaps
you
are
of
moorish
blood
or
i
stopped
not
venturing
to
add
a
oh
come
you
must
see
i
m
a
gipsy
wouldn
t
you
like
me
to
tell
you
did
you
never
hear
tell
of
carmencita
that
s
who
i
am
your
fortune
i
was
such
a
miscreant
in
those
days
now
fifteen
years
ago
that
the
close
proximity
of
a
sorceress
did
not
make
me
recoil
in
horror
so
be
it
i
thought
last
week
i
ate
my
supper
with
a
highway
robber
i
ll
go
and
eat
ices
with
a
servant
of
the
devil
a
traveller
should
see
i
had
yet
another
motive
for
prosecuting
her
acquaintance
when
i
left
college
i
acknowledge
it
with
shame
i
had
wasted
a
certain
amount
of
time
in
studying
occult
science
and
had
even
attempted
more
than
once
to
exorcise
the
powers
of
darkness
though
i
had
been
cured
long
since
of
my
passion
for
such
investigations
i
still
felt
a
certain
attraction
and
curiosity
with
regard
to
all
superstitions
and
i
was
delighted
to
have
this
opportunity
of
discovering
how
far
the
magic
art
had
developed
among
the
gipsies
talking
as
we
went
we
had
reached
the
and
seated
ourselves
at
a
little
table
lighted
by
a
taper
protected
by
a
glass
globe
i
then
had
time
to
take
a
leisurely
view
of
my
while
several
worthy
individuals
who
were
eating
their
ices
stared
at
beholding
me
in
such
gay
company
i
very
much
doubt
whether
senorita
carmen
was
a
gipsy
at
all
events
she
was
infinitely
prettier
than
any
other
woman
of
her
race
i
have
ever
seen
for
a
women
to
be
beautiful
they
say
in
spain
she
must
fulfil
thirty
or
if
it
please
you
better
you
must
be
able
to
define
her
appearance
by
ten
adjectives
applicable
to
three
portions
of
her
person
for
instance
three
things
about
her
must
be
black
her
eyes
her
eyelashes
and
her
eyebrows
three
must
be
dainty
her
fingers
her
lips
her
hair
and
so
forth
for
the
rest
of
this
inventory
see
brantome
my
gipsy
girl
could
lay
no
claim
to
so
many
perfections
her
skin
though
perfectly
smooth
was
almost
of
a
copper
hue
her
eyes
were
set
obliquely
in
her
head
but
they
were
magnificent
and
large
her
lips
a
little
full
but
beautifully
shaped
revealed
a
set
of
teeth
as
white
as
newly
skinned
almonds
her
hair
a
trifle
coarse
perhaps
was
black
with
blue
lights
on
it
like
a
raven
s
wing
long
and
glossy
not
to
weary
my
readers
with
too
prolix
a
description
i
will
merely
add
that
to
every
blemish
she
united
some
advantage
which
was
perhaps
all
the
more
evident
by
contrast
there
was
something
strange
and
wild
about
her
beauty
her
face
astonished
you
at
first
sight
but
nobody
could
forget
it
her
eyes
especially
had
an
expression
of
mingled
sensuality
and
fierceness
which
i
had
never
seen
in
any
other
human
glance
gipsy
s
eye
wolf
s
eye
is
a
spanish
saying
which
denotes
close
observation
if
my
readers
have
no
time
to
go
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
to
study
the
wolf
s
expression
they
will
do
well
to
watch
the
ordinary
cat
when
it
is
lying
in
wait
for
a
sparrow
it
will
be
understood
that
i
should
have
looked
ridiculous
if
i
had
proposed
to
have
my
fortune
told
in
a
i
therefore
begged
the
pretty
witch
s
leave
to
go
home
with
her
she
made
no
difficulties
about
consenting
but
she
wanted
to
know
what
o
clock
it
was
again
and
requested
me
to
make
my
repeater
strike
once
more
is
it
really
gold
she
said
gazing
at
it
with
rapt
attention
when
we
started
off
again
it
was
quite
dark
most
of
the
shops
were
shut
and
the
streets
were
almost
empty
we
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
guadalquivir
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
suburb
we
stopped
in
front
of
a
house
of
anything
but
palatial
appearance
the
door
was
opened
by
a
child
to
whom
the
gipsy
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
language
unknown
to
me
which
i
afterward
understood
to
be
or
the
gipsy
idiom
the
child
instantly
disappeared
leaving
us
in
sole
possession
of
a
tolerably
spacious
room
furnished
with
a
small
table
two
stools
and
a
chest
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
a
jar
of
water
a
pile
of
oranges
and
a
bunch
of
onions
as
soon
as
we
were
left
alone
the
gipsy
produced
out
of
her
chest
a
pack
of
cards
bearing
signs
of
constant
usage
a
magnet
a
dried
chameleon
and
a
few
other
indispensable
adjuncts
of
her
art
then
she
bade
me
cross
my
left
hand
with
a
silver
coin
and
the
magic
ceremonies
duly
began
it
is
unnecessary
to
chronicle
her
predictions
and
as
for
the
style
of
her
performance
it
proved
her
to
be
no
mean
sorceress
unluckily
we
were
soon
disturbed
the
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
and
a
man
shrouded
to
the
eyes
in
a
brown
cloak
entered
the
room
apostrophizing
the
gipsy
in
anything
but
gentle
terms
what
he
said
i
could
not
catch
but
the
tone
of
his
voice
revealed
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
very
evil
temper
the
gipsy
betrayed
neither
surprise
nor
anger
at
his
advent
but
she
ran
to
meet
him
and
with
a
most
striking
volubility
she
poured
out
several
sentences
in
the
mysterious
language
she
had
already
used
in
my
presence
the
word
frequently
reiterated
was
the
only
one
i
understood
i
knew
that
the
gipsies
use
it
to
describe
all
men
not
of
their
own
race
concluding
myself
to
be
the
subject
of
this
discourse
i
was
prepared
for
a
somewhat
delicate
explanation
i
had
already
laid
my
hand
on
the
leg
of
one
of
the
stools
and
was
studying
within
myself
to
discover
the
exact
moment
at
which
i
had
better
throw
it
at
his
head
when
roughly
pushing
the
gipsy
to
one
side
the
man
advanced
toward
me
then
with
a
step
backward
he
cried
what
sir
is
it
you
i
looked
at
him
in
my
turn
and
recognised
my
friend
don
jose
at
that
moment
i
did
feel
rather
sorry
i
had
saved
him
from
the
gallows
what
is
it
you
my
good
fellow
i
exclaimed
with
as
easy
a
smile
as
i
could
muster
you
have
interrupted
this
young
lady
just
when
she
was
foretelling
me
most
interesting
things
the
same
as
ever
there
shall
be
an
end
to
it
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
with
a
savage
glance
at
her
meanwhile
the
was
still
talking
to
him
in
her
own
tongue
she
became
more
and
more
excited
her
eyes
grew
fierce
and
bloodshot
her
features
contracted
she
stamped
her
foot
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
earnestly
pressing
him
to
do
something
he
was
unwilling
to
do
what
this
was
i
fancied
i
understood
only
too
well
by
the
fashion
in
which
she
kept
drawing
her
little
hand
backward
and
forward
under
her
chin
i
was
inclined
to
think
she
wanted
to
have
somebody
s
throat
cut
and
i
had
a
fair
suspicion
the
throat
in
question
was
my
own
to
all
her
torrent
of
eloquence
don
jose
s
only
reply
was
two
or
three
shortly
spoken
words
at
this
the
gipsy
cast
a
glance
of
the
most
utter
scorn
at
him
then
seating
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
room
she
picked
out
an
orange
tore
off
the
skin
and
began
to
eat
it
don
jose
took
hold
of
my
arm
opened
the
door
and
led
me
into
the
street
we
walked
some
two
hundred
paces
in
the
deepest
silence
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
go
straight
on
he
said
and
you
ll
come
to
the
that
instant
he
turned
his
back
on
me
and
departed
at
a
great
pace
i
took
my
way
back
to
my
inn
rather
crestfallen
and
considerably
out
of
temper
the
worst
of
all
was
that
when
i
undressed
i
discovered
my
watch
was
missing
various
considerations
prevented
me
from
going
to
claim
it
next
day
or
requesting
the
to
be
good
enough
to
have
a
search
made
for
it
i
finished
my
work
on
the
dominican
manuscript
and
went
on
to
seville
after
several
months
spent
wandering
hither
and
thither
in
andalusia
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
madrid
and
with
that
object
i
had
to
pass
through
cordova
i
had
no
intention
of
making
any
stay
there
for
i
had
taken
a
dislike
to
that
fair
city
and
to
the
ladies
who
bathed
in
the
guadalquivir
nevertheless
i
had
some
visits
to
pay
and
certain
errands
to
do
which
must
detain
me
several
days
in
the
old
capital
of
the
mussulman
princes
the
moment
i
made
my
appearance
in
the
dominican
convent
one
of
the
monks
who
had
always
shown
the
most
lively
interest
in
my
inquiries
as
to
the
site
of
the
battlefield
of
munda
welcomed
me
with
open
arms
exclaiming
praised
be
god
you
are
welcome
my
dear
friend
we
all
thought
you
were
dead
and
i
myself
have
said
many
a
and
not
that
i
regret
them
for
your
soul
then
you
weren
t
murdered
after
all
that
you
were
robbed
we
know
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
rather
astonished
oh
you
know
that
splendid
repeater
you
used
to
strike
in
the
library
whenever
we
said
it
was
time
for
us
to
go
into
church
well
it
has
been
found
and
you
ll
get
it
why
i
broke
in
rather
put
out
of
countenance
i
lost
it
the
rascal
s
under
lock
and
key
and
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
man
who
would
shoot
any
christian
for
the
sake
of
a
we
were
most
dreadfully
afraid
he
had
killed
you
i
ll
go
with
you
to
the
and
he
ll
give
you
back
your
fine
watch
and
after
that
you
won
t
dare
to
say
the
law
doesn
t
do
its
work
properly
in
i
assure
you
said
i
i
d
far
rather
lose
my
watch
than
have
to
give
evidence
in
court
to
hang
a
poor
unlucky
devil
and
especially
because
because
oh
you
needn
t
be
alarmed
he
s
thoroughly
done
for
they
might
hang
him
twice
over
but
when
i
say
hang
i
say
wrong
your
thief
is
an
so
he
s
to
be
garrotted
the
day
after
without
fail
so
you
see
one
theft
more
or
less
won
t
affect
his
position
would
to
god
he
had
done
nothing
but
steal
but
he
has
committed
several
murders
one
more
hideous
than
the
in
the
noble
class
still
enjoyed
this
privilege
nowadays
under
the
constitutional
commoners
have
attained
the
same
dignity
what
s
his
name
in
this
country
he
is
only
known
as
jose
navarro
but
he
has
another
basque
name
which
neither
your
nor
i
will
ever
be
able
to
pronounce
by
the
way
the
man
is
worth
seeing
and
you
who
like
to
study
the
peculiar
features
of
each
country
shouldn
t
lose
this
chance
of
noting
how
a
rascal
bids
farewell
to
this
world
in
spain
he
is
in
jail
and
father
martinez
will
take
you
to
so
bent
was
my
dominican
friend
on
my
seeing
the
preparations
for
this
neat
little
hanging
job
that
i
was
fain
to
agree
i
went
to
see
the
prisoner
having
provided
myself
with
a
bundle
of
cigars
which
i
hoped
might
induce
him
to
forgive
my
intrusion
i
was
ushered
into
don
jose
s
presence
just
as
he
was
sitting
at
table
he
greeted
me
with
a
rather
distant
nod
and
thanked
me
civilly
for
the
present
i
had
brought
him
having
counted
the
cigars
in
the
bundle
i
had
placed
in
his
hand
he
took
out
a
certain
number
and
returned
me
the
rest
remarking
that
he
would
not
need
any
more
of
them
i
inquired
whether
by
laying
out
a
little
money
or
by
applying
to
my
friends
i
might
not
be
able
to
do
something
to
soften
his
lot
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
begin
with
smiling
sadly
soon
as
by
an
he
asked
me
to
have
a
mass
said
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
then
he
added
nervously
would
you
would
you
have
another
said
for
a
person
who
did
you
a
wrong
assuredly
i
will
my
dear
fellow
i
answered
but
no
one
in
this
country
has
wronged
me
so
far
as
i
he
took
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
looking
very
grave
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
spoke
again
might
i
dare
to
ask
another
service
of
you
when
you
go
back
to
your
own
country
perhaps
you
will
pass
through
navarre
at
all
events
you
ll
go
by
vittoria
which
isn
t
very
far
yes
said
i
i
shall
certainly
pass
through
vittoria
but
i
may
very
possibly
go
round
by
pampeluna
and
for
your
sake
i
believe
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
well
if
you
do
go
to
pampeluna
you
ll
see
more
than
one
thing
that
will
interest
you
it
s
a
fine
town
i
ll
give
you
this
medal
he
showed
me
a
little
silver
medal
that
he
wore
hung
around
his
neck
you
ll
wrap
it
up
in
paper
he
paused
a
moment
to
master
his
emotion
and
you
ll
take
it
or
send
it
to
an
old
lady
whose
address
i
ll
give
you
tell
her
i
am
dead
but
don
t
tell
her
how
i
i
promised
to
perform
his
commission
i
saw
him
the
next
day
and
spent
part
of
it
in
his
company
from
his
lips
i
learned
the
sad
incidents
that
follow
chapter
iii
i
was
born
he
said
at
elizondo
in
the
valley
of
baztan
my
name
is
don
jose
lizzarrabengoa
and
you
know
enough
of
spain
sir
to
know
at
once
by
my
name
that
i
come
of
an
old
christian
and
basque
stock
i
call
myself
don
because
i
have
a
right
to
it
and
if
i
were
at
elizondo
i
could
show
you
my
parchment
genealogy
my
family
wanted
me
to
go
into
the
church
and
made
me
study
for
it
but
i
did
not
like
work
i
was
too
fond
of
playing
tennis
and
that
was
my
ruin
when
we
navarrese
begin
to
play
tennis
we
forget
everything
else
one
day
when
i
had
won
the
game
a
young
fellow
from
alava
picked
a
quarrel
with
me
we
took
to
our
and
i
won
again
but
i
had
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
i
fell
in
with
some
dragoons
and
enlisted
in
the
almanza
cavalry
regiment
mountain
folks
like
us
soon
learn
to
be
soldiers
before
long
i
was
a
corporal
and
i
had
been
told
i
should
soon
be
made
a
sergeant
when
to
my
misfortune
i
was
put
on
guard
at
the
seville
tobacco
factory
if
you
have
been
to
seville
you
have
seen
the
great
building
just
outside
the
ramparts
close
to
the
guadalquivir
i
can
fancy
i
see
the
entrance
and
the
guard
room
just
beside
it
even
now
when
spanish
soldiers
are
on
duty
they
either
play
cards
or
go
to
sleep
i
like
an
honest
navarrese
always
tried
to
keep
myself
busy
i
was
making
a
chain
to
hold
my
out
of
a
bit
of
wire
all
at
once
my
comrades
said
there
s
the
bell
ringing
the
girls
are
coming
back
to
you
must
know
sir
that
there
are
quite
four
or
five
hundred
women
employed
in
the
factory
they
roll
the
cigars
in
a
great
room
into
which
no
man
can
go
without
a
permit
from
the
because
when
the
weather
is
hot
they
make
themselves
at
home
especially
the
young
ones
when
the
come
back
after
their
dinner
numbers
of
young
men
go
down
to
see
them
pass
by
and
talk
all
sorts
of
nonsense
to
them
very
few
of
those
young
ladies
will
refuse
a
silk
mantilla
and
men
who
care
for
that
sort
of
sport
have
nothing
to
do
but
bend
down
and
pick
their
fish
up
while
the
others
watched
the
girls
go
by
i
stayed
on
my
bench
near
the
door
i
was
a
young
fellow
then
my
heart
was
still
in
my
own
country
and
i
didn
t
believe
in
any
pretty
girls
who
hadn
t
blue
skirts
and
long
plaits
of
hair
falling
on
their
shoulders
and
besides
i
was
rather
afraid
of
the
andalusian
women
i
had
not
got
used
to
their
ways
yet
they
were
always
jeering
one
never
spoke
a
single
word
of
sense
so
i
was
sitting
with
my
nose
down
upon
my
chain
when
i
heard
some
bystanders
say
here
comes
the
then
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
and
i
saw
her
it
was
that
very
carmen
you
know
and
in
whose
rooms
i
met
you
a
few
months
ago
sticks
used
by
the
basques
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
municipal
police
arrangements
and
local
government
regulations
the
costume
usually
worn
by
peasant
women
in
navarre
and
the
basque
provinces
she
was
wearing
a
very
short
skirt
below
which
her
white
silk
stockings
with
more
than
one
hole
in
them
and
her
dainty
red
morocco
shoes
fastened
with
ribbons
were
clearly
seen
she
had
thrown
her
mantilla
back
to
show
her
shoulders
and
a
great
bunch
of
acacia
that
was
thrust
into
her
chemise
she
had
another
acacia
blossom
in
the
corner
of
her
mouth
and
she
walked
along
swaying
her
hips
like
a
filly
from
the
cordova
stud
farm
in
my
country
anybody
who
had
seen
a
woman
dressed
in
that
fashion
would
have
crossed
himself
at
seville
every
man
paid
her
some
bold
compliment
on
her
appearance
she
had
an
answer
for
each
and
all
with
her
hand
on
her
hip
as
bold
as
the
thorough
gipsy
she
was
at
first
i
didn
t
like
her
looks
and
i
fell
to
my
work
again
but
she
like
all
women
and
cats
who
won
t
come
if
you
call
them
and
do
come
if
you
don
t
call
them
stopped
short
in
front
of
me
and
spoke
to
me
said
she
in
the
andalusian
fashion
won
t
you
give
me
your
chain
for
the
keys
of
my
strong
box
it
s
for
my
said
i
your
she
cried
with
a
laugh
oho
i
suppose
the
gentleman
makes
lace
as
he
wants
pins
everybody
began
to
laugh
and
i
felt
myself
getting
red
in
the
face
and
couldn
t
hit
on
anything
in
answer
come
my
love
she
began
again
make
me
seven
ells
of
lace
for
my
mantilla
my
pet
and
taking
the
acacia
blossom
out
of
her
mouth
she
flipped
it
at
me
with
her
thumb
so
that
it
hit
me
just
between
the
eyes
i
tell
you
sir
i
felt
as
if
a
bullet
had
struck
me
i
didn
t
know
which
way
to
look
i
sat
like
a
wooden
board
when
she
had
gone
into
the
factory
i
saw
the
acacia
blossom
which
had
fallen
on
the
ground
between
my
feet
i
don
t
know
what
made
me
do
it
but
i
picked
it
up
unseen
by
any
of
my
comrades
and
put
it
carefully
inside
my
jacket
that
was
my
first
folly
two
or
three
hours
later
i
was
still
thinking
about
her
when
a
panting
porter
rushed
into
the
he
told
us
a
woman
had
been
stabbed
in
the
great
and
that
the
guard
must
be
sent
in
at
once
the
sergeant
told
me
to
take
two
men
and
go
and
see
to
it
i
took
my
two
men
and
went
upstairs
imagine
sir
that
when
i
got
into
the
room
i
found
to
begin
with
some
three
hundred
women
stripped
to
their
shifts
or
very
near
it
all
of
them
screaming
and
yelling
and
gesticulating
and
making
such
a
row
that
you
couldn
t
have
heard
god
s
own
thunder
on
one
side
of
the
room
one
of
the
women
was
lying
on
the
broad
of
her
back
streaming
with
blood
with
an
x
newly
cut
on
her
face
by
two
strokes
of
a
knife
opposite
the
wounded
woman
whom
the
of
the
band
were
attending
i
saw
carmen
held
by
five
or
six
of
her
comrades
the
wounded
woman
was
crying
out
a
confessor
a
confessor
i
m
killed
carmen
said
nothing
at
all
she
clinched
her
teeth
and
rolled
her
eyes
like
a
chameleon
what
s
this
i
asked
i
had
hard
work
to
find
out
what
had
happened
for
all
the
talked
at
once
it
appeared
that
the
injured
girl
had
boasted
she
had
money
enough
in
her
pocket
to
buy
a
donkey
at
the
triana
market
why
said
carmen
who
had
a
tongue
of
her
own
can
t
you
do
with
a
broom
stung
by
this
taunt
it
may
be
because
she
felt
herself
rather
unsound
in
that
particular
the
other
girl
replied
that
she
knew
nothing
about
brooms
seeing
she
had
not
the
honour
of
being
either
a
gipsy
or
one
of
the
devil
s
godchildren
but
that
the
senorita
carmen
would
shortly
make
acquaintance
with
her
donkey
when
the
took
her
out
riding
with
two
lackeys
behind
her
to
keep
the
flies
off
well
retorted
carmen
i
ll
make
troughs
for
the
flies
to
drink
out
of
on
your
cheeks
and
i
ll
paint
a
on
them
and
thereupon
slap
bank
she
began
making
andrew
s
crosses
on
the
girl
s
face
with
a
knife
she
had
been
using
for
cutting
off
the
ends
of
the
cigars
un
paint
a
xebec
a
particular
type
of
ship
most
spanish
vessels
of
this
description
have
a
checkered
red
and
white
stripe
painted
around
them
the
case
was
quite
clear
i
took
hold
of
carmen
s
arm
sister
mine
i
said
civilly
you
must
come
with
she
shot
a
glance
of
recognition
at
me
but
she
said
with
a
resigned
look
let
s
be
off
where
is
my
mantilla
she
put
it
over
her
head
so
that
only
one
of
her
great
eyes
was
to
be
seen
and
followed
my
two
men
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
when
we
got
to
the
guardroom
the
sergeant
said
it
was
a
serious
job
and
he
must
send
her
to
prison
i
was
told
off
again
to
take
her
there
i
put
her
between
two
dragoons
as
a
corporal
does
on
such
occasions
we
started
off
for
the
town
the
gipsy
had
begun
by
holding
her
tongue
but
when
we
got
to
the
de
la
you
know
it
and
that
it
earns
its
name
by
its
many
windings
she
began
by
dropping
her
mantilla
on
to
her
shoulders
so
as
to
show
me
her
coaxing
little
face
and
turning
round
to
me
as
well
as
she
could
she
said
where
are
you
taking
me
to
to
prison
my
poor
child
i
replied
as
gently
as
i
could
just
as
any
soldier
is
bound
to
speak
to
a
prisoner
and
especially
to
a
woman
alack
what
will
become
of
me
senor
oficial
have
pity
on
me
you
are
so
young
so
then
in
a
lower
tone
she
said
let
me
get
away
and
i
ll
give
you
a
bit
of
the
that
will
make
every
woman
fall
in
love
with
you
the
sir
is
the
loadstone
with
which
the
gipsies
declare
one
who
knows
how
to
use
it
can
cast
any
number
of
spells
if
you
can
make
a
woman
drink
a
little
scrap
of
it
powdered
in
a
glass
of
white
wine
she
ll
never
be
able
to
resist
you
i
answered
as
gravely
as
i
could
we
are
not
here
to
talk
nonsense
you
ll
have
to
go
to
prison
those
are
my
orders
and
there
s
no
help
for
it
we
men
from
the
basque
country
have
an
accent
which
all
spaniards
easily
recognise
on
the
other
hand
not
one
of
them
can
ever
learn
to
say
yes
sir
so
carmen
easily
guessed
i
was
from
the
provinces
you
know
sir
that
the
gipsies
who
belong
to
no
particular
country
and
are
always
moving
about
speak
every
language
and
most
of
them
are
quite
at
home
in
portugal
in
france
in
our
provinces
in
catalonia
or
anywhere
else
they
can
even
make
themselves
understood
by
moors
and
english
people
carmen
knew
basque
tolerably
well
ene
comrade
of
my
heart
said
she
suddenly
do
you
belong
to
our
country
our
language
is
so
beautiful
sir
that
when
we
hear
it
in
a
foreign
country
it
makes
us
quiver
i
wish
added
the
bandit
in
a
lower
tone
i
could
have
a
confessor
from
my
own
after
a
silence
he
began
again
i
belong
to
elizondo
i
answered
in
basque
very
much
affected
by
the
sound
of
my
own
language
i
come
from
etchalar
said
she
that
s
a
district
about
four
hours
journey
from
my
home
i
was
carried
off
to
seville
by
the
gipsies
i
was
working
in
the
factory
to
earn
enough
money
to
take
me
back
to
navarre
to
my
poor
old
mother
who
has
no
support
in
the
world
but
me
besides
her
little
with
twenty
trees
in
it
ah
if
i
were
only
back
in
my
own
country
looking
up
at
the
white
mountains
i
have
been
insulted
here
because
i
don
t
belong
to
this
land
of
rogues
and
sellers
of
rotten
oranges
and
those
hussies
are
all
banded
together
against
me
because
i
told
them
that
not
all
their
seville
and
all
their
knives
would
frighten
an
honest
lad
from
our
country
with
his
blue
cap
and
his
good
comrade
won
t
you
do
anything
to
help
your
own
countrywoman
field
garden
bravos
boasters
she
was
lying
then
sir
as
she
has
always
lied
i
don
t
know
that
that
girl
ever
spoke
a
word
of
truth
in
her
life
but
when
she
did
speak
i
believed
her
i
couldn
t
help
myself
she
mangled
her
basque
words
and
i
believed
she
came
from
navarre
but
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
and
her
skin
were
enough
to
prove
she
was
a
gipsy
i
was
mad
i
paid
no
more
attention
to
anything
i
thought
to
myself
that
if
the
spaniards
had
dared
to
speak
evil
of
my
country
i
would
have
slashed
their
faces
just
as
she
had
slashed
her
comrade
s
in
short
i
was
like
a
drunken
man
i
was
beginning
to
say
foolish
things
and
i
was
very
near
doing
them
if
i
were
to
give
you
a
push
and
you
tumbled
down
good
she
began
again
in
basque
those
two
castilian
recruits
wouldn
t
be
able
to
keep
me
faith
i
forgot
my
orders
i
forgot
everything
and
i
said
to
her
well
then
my
friend
girl
of
my
country
try
it
and
may
our
lady
of
the
mountain
help
you
just
at
that
moment
we
were
passing
one
of
the
many
narrow
lanes
one
sees
in
seville
all
at
once
carmen
turned
and
struck
me
in
the
chest
with
her
fist
i
tumbled
backward
purposely
with
a
bound
she
sprang
over
me
and
ran
off
showing
us
a
pair
of
legs
people
talk
about
a
pair
of
basque
legs
but
hers
were
far
better
as
fleet
as
they
were
as
for
me
i
picked
myself
up
at
once
but
i
stuck
out
my
crossways
and
barred
the
street
so
that
my
comrades
were
checked
at
the
very
first
moment
of
pursuit
then
i
started
to
run
myself
and
they
after
me
but
how
were
we
to
catch
her
there
was
no
fear
of
that
what
with
our
spurs
our
swords
and
our
lances
all
spanish
cavalry
soldiers
carry
lances
in
less
time
than
i
have
taken
to
tell
you
the
story
the
prisoner
had
disappeared
and
besides
every
gossip
in
the
quarter
covered
her
flight
poked
scorn
at
us
and
pointed
us
in
the
wrong
direction
after
a
good
deal
of
marching
and
countermarching
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
without
a
receipt
from
the
governor
of
the
jail
to
avoid
punishment
my
men
made
known
that
carmen
had
spoken
to
me
in
basque
and
to
tell
the
truth
it
did
not
seem
very
natural
that
a
blow
from
such
a
little
creature
should
have
so
easily
overthrown
a
strong
fellow
like
me
the
whole
thing
looked
suspicious
or
at
all
events
not
when
i
came
off
guard
i
lost
my
corporal
s
stripes
and
was
condemned
to
a
month
s
imprisonment
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
punished
since
i
had
been
in
the
service
farewell
now
to
the
sergeant
s
stripes
on
which
i
had
reckoned
so
surely
the
first
days
in
prison
were
very
dreary
when
i
enlisted
i
had
fancied
i
was
sure
to
become
an
officer
at
all
events
two
of
my
compatriots
longa
and
mina
are
after
all
chapalangarra
was
a
colonel
and
i
have
played
tennis
a
score
of
times
with
his
brother
who
was
just
a
needy
fellow
like
myself
now
i
kept
crying
to
myself
all
the
time
you
served
without
being
punished
has
been
lost
now
you
have
a
bad
mark
against
your
name
and
to
get
yourself
back
into
the
officers
good
graces
you
ll
have
to
work
ten
times
as
hard
as
when
you
joined
as
a
and
why
have
i
got
myself
punished
for
the
sake
of
a
gipsy
hussy
who
made
game
of
me
and
who
at
this
moment
is
busy
thieving
in
some
corner
of
the
town
yet
i
couldn
t
help
thinking
about
her
will
you
believe
it
sir
those
silk
stockings
of
hers
with
the
holes
in
them
of
which
she
had
given
me
such
a
full
view
as
she
took
to
her
heels
were
always
before
my
eyes
i
used
to
look
through
the
barred
windows
of
the
jail
into
the
street
and
among
all
the
women
who
passed
i
never
could
see
one
to
compare
with
that
minx
of
a
girl
and
then
in
spite
of
myself
i
used
to
smell
the
acacia
blossom
she
had
thrown
at
me
and
which
dry
as
it
was
still
kept
its
sweet
scent
if
there
are
such
things
as
witches
that
girl
certainly
was
one
one
day
the
jailer
came
in
and
gave
me
an
alcala
roll
de
los
a
village
two
leagues
from
seville
where
the
most
delicious
rolls
are
made
they
are
said
to
owe
their
quality
to
the
water
of
the
place
and
great
quantities
of
them
are
brought
to
seville
every
day
look
here
said
he
this
is
what
your
cousin
has
sent
i
took
the
loaf
very
much
astonished
for
i
had
no
cousin
in
seville
it
may
be
a
mistake
thought
i
as
i
looked
at
the
roll
but
it
was
so
appetizing
and
smelt
so
good
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
eat
it
without
troubling
my
head
as
to
whence
it
came
or
for
whom
it
was
really
intended
when
i
tried
to
cut
it
my
knife
struck
on
something
hard
i
looked
and
found
a
little
english
file
which
had
been
slipped
into
the
dough
before
the
roll
had
been
baked
the
roll
also
contained
a
gold
piece
of
two
piastres
then
i
had
no
further
doubt
it
was
a
present
from
carmen
to
people
of
her
blood
liberty
is
everything
and
they
would
set
a
town
on
fire
to
save
themselves
one
day
in
prison
the
girl
was
artful
indeed
and
armed
with
that
roll
i
might
have
snapped
my
fingers
at
the
jailers
in
one
hour
with
that
little
file
i
could
have
sawn
through
the
thickest
bar
and
with
the
gold
coin
i
could
have
exchanged
my
soldier
s
cloak
for
civilian
garb
at
the
nearest
shop
you
may
fancy
that
a
man
who
has
often
taken
the
eaglets
out
of
their
nests
in
our
cliff
would
have
found
no
difficulty
in
getting
down
to
the
street
out
of
a
window
less
than
thirty
feet
above
it
but
i
didn
t
choose
to
escape
i
still
had
a
soldier
s
code
of
honour
and
desertion
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
heinous
crime
yet
this
proof
of
remembrance
touched
me
when
a
man
is
in
prison
he
likes
to
think
he
has
a
friend
outside
who
takes
an
interest
in
him
the
gold
coin
did
rather
offend
me
i
should
have
very
much
liked
to
return
it
but
where
was
i
to
find
my
creditor
that
did
not
seem
a
very
easy
task
after
the
ceremony
of
my
degradation
i
had
fancied
my
sufferings
were
over
but
i
had
another
humiliation
before
me
that
came
when
i
left
prison
and
was
told
off
for
duty
and
put
on
sentry
as
a
private
soldier
you
can
not
conceive
what
a
proud
man
endures
at
such
a
moment
i
believe
i
would
have
just
as
soon
been
shot
dead
then
i
should
have
marched
alone
at
the
head
of
my
platoon
at
all
events
i
should
have
felt
i
was
somebody
with
the
eyes
of
others
fixed
upon
me
i
was
posted
as
sentry
on
the
door
of
the
colonel
s
house
the
colonel
was
a
young
man
rich
fond
of
amusing
himself
all
the
young
officers
were
there
and
many
civilians
as
well
besides
ladies
actresses
as
it
was
said
for
my
part
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
whole
town
had
agreed
to
meet
at
that
door
in
order
to
stare
at
me
then
up
drove
the
colonel
s
carriage
with
his
valet
on
the
box
and
who
should
i
see
get
out
of
it
but
the
gipsy
girl
she
was
dressed
up
this
time
to
the
eyes
togged
out
in
golden
ribbons
a
spangled
gown
blue
shoes
all
spangled
too
flowers
and
gold
lace
all
over
her
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
tambourine
with
her
there
were
two
other
gipsy
women
one
young
and
one
old
they
always
have
one
old
woman
who
goes
with
them
and
then
an
old
man
with
a
guitar
a
gipsy
too
to
play
alone
and
also
for
their
dances
you
must
know
these
gipsy
girls
are
often
sent
for
to
private
houses
to
dance
their
special
dance
the
and
often
too
for
quite
other
purposes
carmen
recognised
me
and
we
exchanged
glances
i
don
t
know
why
but
at
that
moment
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been
a
hundred
feet
beneath
the
ground
said
she
oficial
mio
you
keep
guard
like
a
recruit
and
before
i
could
find
a
word
in
answer
she
was
inside
the
house
comrade
the
whole
party
was
assembled
in
the
and
in
spite
of
the
crowd
i
could
see
nearly
everything
that
went
on
through
the
lattice
i
could
hear
the
castanets
and
the
tambourine
the
laughter
and
applause
sometimes
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
head
as
she
bounded
upward
with
her
tambourine
then
i
could
hear
the
officers
saying
many
things
to
her
which
brought
the
blood
to
my
face
as
to
her
answers
i
knew
nothing
of
them
it
was
on
that
day
i
think
that
i
began
to
love
her
in
earnest
for
three
or
four
times
i
was
tempted
to
rush
into
the
and
drive
my
sword
into
the
bodies
of
all
the
coxcombs
who
were
making
love
to
her
my
torture
lasted
a
full
hour
then
the
gipsies
came
out
and
the
carriage
took
them
away
as
she
passed
me
by
carmen
looked
at
me
with
those
eyes
you
know
and
said
to
me
very
low
comrade
people
who
are
fond
of
good
come
to
eat
it
at
lillas
pastia
s
at
triana
in
most
of
the
houses
in
seville
there
is
an
inner
court
surrounded
by
an
arched
portico
this
is
used
as
a
room
in
summer
over
the
court
is
stretched
a
piece
of
tent
cloth
which
is
watered
during
the
day
and
removed
at
night
the
street
door
is
almost
always
left
open
and
the
passage
leading
to
the
court
is
closed
by
an
iron
lattice
of
very
elegant
workmanship
then
light
as
a
kid
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
the
coachman
whipped
up
his
mules
and
the
whole
merry
party
departed
whither
i
know
not
you
may
fancy
that
the
moment
i
was
off
guard
i
went
to
triana
but
first
of
all
i
got
myself
shaved
and
brushed
myself
up
as
if
i
had
been
going
on
parade
she
was
living
with
lillas
pastia
an
old
seller
a
gipsy
as
black
as
a
moor
to
whose
house
a
great
many
civilians
resorted
to
eat
especially
i
think
because
carmen
had
taken
up
her
quarters
there
lillas
she
said
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
i
m
not
going
to
work
any
more
will
be
a
day
too
come
let
us
go
for
a
walk

proverb
she
pulled
her
mantilla
across
her
nose
and
there
we
were
in
the
street
without
my
knowing
in
the
least
whither
i
was
bound
senorita

i
think
i
have
to
thank
you
for
a
present
i

in

of

as
for

why

kept

she
exclaimed
bursting
out
laughing
but
after
all
that
s
all
the
better
for
i

decidedly
hard
up

the

finds
a
gipsy
proverb
we
had
turned
back
toward
seville
at
the
entrance
of
the
de
la
she
bought
a
dozen
oranges
which
she
made
me
put
into
my
handkerchief
a
little
farther
on
she
bought
a
roll
a
sausage
and
a
bottle
of
manzanilla
then
last
of
all
she
turned
into
a
confectioner
s
shop
there
she
threw
the
gold
coin
i
had
returned
to
her
on
the
counter
with
another
she
had
in
her
pocket
and
some
small
silver
and
then
she
asked
me
for
all
the
money
i
had
all
i
possessed
was
one
peseta
and
a
few
cuartos
which
i
handed
over
to
her
very
much
ashamed
of
not
having
more
i
thought
she
would
have
carried
away
the
whole
shop
she
took
everything
that
was
best
and
dearest
preserved
fruits
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
and
all
these
too
i
had
to
carry
in
paper
bags
perhaps
you
know
the
del
where
there
is
a
head
of
don
pedro
the
avenger
that
head
ought
to
have
given
me
pause
we
stopped
at
an
old
house
in
that
street
she
passed
into
the
entry
and
knocked
at
a
door
on
the
ground
floor
it
was
opened
by
a
gipsy
a
servant
of
the
devil
carmen
said
a
few
words
to
her
in
romany
at
first
the
old
hag
grumbled
to
smooth
her
down
carmen
gave
her
a
couple
of
oranges
and
a
handful
of
and
let
her
have
a
taste
of
wine
then
she
hung
her
cloak
on
her
back
and
led
her
to
the
door
which
she
fastened
with
a
wooden
bar
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
she
began
to
laugh
and
caper
like
a
lunatic
singing
out
you
are
my
i
m
your
sugared
yolks
of
eggs
a
sort
of
nougat
this
king
don
pedro
whom
we
call
the
cruel
and
whom
queen
isabella
the
catholic
never
called
anything
but
the
avenger
was
fond
of
walking
about
the
streets
of
seville
at
night
in
search
of
adventures
like
the
caliph
haroun
al
raschid
one
night
in
a
lonely
street
he
quarrelled
with
a
man
who
was
singing
a
serenade
there
was
a
fight
and
the
king
killed
the
amorous
at
the
clashing
of
their
swords
an
old
woman
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
lighted
up
the
scene
with
a
tiny
lamp
candilejo
which
she
held
in
her
hand
my
readers
must
be
informed
that
king
don
pedro
though
nimble
and
muscular
suffered
from
one
strange
fault
in
his
physical
conformation
whenever
he
walked
his
knees
cracked
loudly
by
this
cracking
the
old
woman
easily
recognised
him
the
next
day
the
in
charge
came
to
make
his
report
to
the
king
sir
a
duel
was
fought
last
night
in
such
a
street
one
of
the
combatants
is
have
you
found
the
murderer
yes
why
has
he
not
been
punished
already
sir
i
await
your
orders
carry
out
the
now
the
king
had
just
published
a
decree
that
every
duellist
was
to
have
his
head
cut
off
and
that
head
was
to
be
set
up
on
the
scene
of
the
fight
the
got
out
of
the
difficulty
like
a
clever
man
he
had
the
head
sawed
off
a
statue
of
the
king
and
set
that
up
in
a
niche
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
which
the
murder
had
taken
place
the
king
and
all
the
sevillians
thought
this
a
very
good
joke
the
street
took
its
name
from
the
lamp
held
by
the
old
woman
the
only
witness
of
the
incident
the
above
is
the
popular
tradition
zuniga
tells
the
story
somewhat
differently
however
that
may
be
a
street
called
del
still
exists
in
seville
and
in
that
street
there
is
a
bust
which
is
said
to
be
a
portrait
of
don
pedro
this
bust
unfortunately
is
a
modern
production
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
old
one
had
become
very
much
defaced
and
the
municipality
had
it
replaced
by
that
now
to
be
seen
husband
wife
there
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
laden
with
all
her
purchases
and
not
knowing
where
i
was
to
put
them
down
she
tumbled
them
all
onto
the
floor
and
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
saying
i
pay
my
debts
i
pay
my
debts
that
s
the
law
of
the
feminine
plural
literally
black
the
name
the
gipsies
apply
to
themselves
in
their
own
language
ah
sir
that
day
that
day
when
i
think
of
it
i
forget
what
must
bring
me
for
a
moment
the
bandit
held
his
peace
then
when
he
had
relighted
his
cigar
he
began
afresh
we
spent
the
whole
day
together
eating
drinking
and
so
forth
when
she
had
stuffed
herself
with
like
any
child
of
six
years
old
she
thrust
them
by
handfuls
into
the
old
woman
s
that
ll
make
sherbet
for
her
she
said
she
smashed
the
by
throwing
them
against
the
walls
they
ll
keep
the
flies
from
bothering
there
was
no
prank
or
wild
frolic
she
didn
t
indulge
in
i
told
her
i
should
have
liked
to
see
her
dance
only
there
were
no
castanets
to
be
had
instantly
she
seized
the
old
woman
s
only
earthenware
plate
smashed
it
up
and
there
she
was
dancing
the
and
making
the
bits
of
broken
crockery
rattle
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
ebony
and
ivory
castanets
that
girl
was
good
company
i
can
tell
you
evening
fell
and
i
heard
the
drums
beating
tattoo
i
must
get
back
to
quarters
for
i
said
to
quarters
she
answered
with
a
look
of
scorn
are
you
a
negro
slave
to
let
yourself
be
driven
with
a
ramrod
like
that
you
are
as
silly
as
a
canary
bird
your
dress
suits
your
nature
pshaw
you
ve
no
more
heart
than
a
spanish
dragoons
wear
a
yellow
uniform
i
stayed
on
making
up
my
mind
to
the
inevitable
the
next
morning
the
first
suggestion
of
parting
came
from
her
hark
ye
joseito
she
said
have
i
paid
you
by
our
law
i
owed
you
nothing
because
you
re
a
but
you
re
a
fellow
and
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
now
we
re
quits
i
asked
her
when
i
should
see
her
again
when
you
re
less
of
a
simpleton
she
retorted
with
a
laugh
then
in
a
more
serious
tone
do
you
know
my
son
i
really
believe
i
love
you
a
little
but
that
can
t
last
the
dog
and
the
wolf
can
t
agree
for
long
perhaps
if
you
turned
gipsy
i
might
care
to
be
your
but
that
s
all
nonsense
such
things
aren
t
possible
pshaw
my
boy
believe
me
you
re
well
out
of
it
you
ve
come
across
the
devil
he
isn
t
always
black
and
you
ve
not
had
your
neck
wrung
i
wear
a
woollen
suit
but
i
m
no
sheep
go
and
burn
a
candle
to
your
she
deserves
it
well
come
once
more
don
t
think
any
more
about
or
she
ll
end
by
making
you
marry
a
widow
with
wooden

a
gipsy
proverb
the
saint
the
holy
virgin
the
gallows
which
is
the
widow
of
the
last
man
hanged
upon
it
as
she
spoke
she
drew
back
the
bar
that
closed
the
door
and
once
we
were
out
in
the
street
she
wrapped
her
mantilla
about
her
and
turned
on
her
heel
she
spoke
the
truth
i
should
have
done
far
better
never
to
think
of
her
again
but
after
that
day
in
the
del
i
couldn
t
think
of
anything
else
all
day
long
i
used
to
walk
about
hoping
i
might
meet
her
i
sought
news
of
her
from
the
old
hag
and
from
the
seller
they
both
told
me
she
had
gone
away
to
which
is
their
name
for
portugal
they
probably
said
it
by
carmen
s
orders
but
i
soon
found
out
they
were
lying
some
weeks
after
my
day
in
the
del
i
was
on
duty
at
one
of
the
town
gates
a
little
way
from
the
gate
there
was
a
breach
in
the
wall
the
masons
were
working
at
it
in
the
daytime
and
at
night
a
sentinel
was
posted
on
it
to
prevent
smugglers
from
getting
in
all
through
one
day
i
saw
lillas
pastia
going
backward
and
forward
near
the
and
talking
to
some
of
my
comrades
they
all
knew
him
well
and
his
and
fritters
even
better
he
came
up
to
me
and
asked
if
i
had
any
news
of
carmen
no
said
i
well
said
he
you
ll
soon
hear
of
her
old
he
was
not
mistaken
that
night
i
was
posted
to
guard
the
breach
in
the
wall
as
soon
as
the
sergeant
had
disappeared
i
saw
a
woman
coming
toward
me
my
heart
told
me
it
was
carmen
still
i
shouted
keep
off
nobody
can
pass
here
now
don
t
be
spiteful
she
said
making
herself
known
to
me
what
you
here
carmen
yes
let
us
say
few
words
but
wise
ones
would
you
like
to
earn
a
douro
some
people
will
be
coming
with
bundles
let
them
no
said
i
i
must
not
allow
them
through
these
are
my
orders
orders
you
didn
t
think
about
orders
in
the
del
ah
i
cried
quite
maddened
by
the
very
thought
of
that
night
it
was
well
worth
while
to
forget
my
orders
for
that
but
i
won
t
have
any
smuggler
s
money
well
if
you
won
t
have
money
shall
we
go
and
dine
together
at
old
dorotea
s
no
said
i
half
choked
by
the
effort
it
cost
me
no
i
can
very
good
if
you
make
so
many
difficulties
i
know
to
whom
i
can
go
i
ll
ask
your
officer
if
he
ll
come
with
me
to
dorotea
s
he
looks
and
he
ll
post
a
sentry
who
ll
only
see
what
he
had
better
see
i
shall
have
a
good
laugh
the
day
the
order
comes
out
to
hang
you
i
was
weak
enough
to
call
her
back
and
i
promised
to
let
the
whole
of
gipsydom
pass
in
if
that
were
necessary
so
that
i
secured
the
only
reward
i
longed
for
she
instantly
swore
she
would
keep
her
word
faithfully
the
very
next
day
and
ran
off
to
summon
her
friends
who
were
close
by
there
were
five
of
them
of
whom
pastia
was
one
all
well
loaded
with
english
goods
carmen
kept
watch
for
them
she
was
to
warn
them
with
her
castanets
the
instant
she
caught
sight
of
the
patrol
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
that
the
smugglers
finished
their
job
in
a
moment
the
next
day
i
went
to
the
del
carmen
kept
me
waiting
and
when
she
came
she
was
in
rather
a
bad
temper
i
don
t
like
people
who
have
to
be
pressed
she
said
you
did
me
a
much
greater
service
the
first
time
without
knowing
you
d
gain
anything
by
it
yesterday
you
bargained
with
me
i
don
t
know
why
i
ve
come
for
i
don
t
care
for
you
any
more
here
be
off
with
you
here
s
a
douro
for
your
i
very
nearly
threw
the
coin
at
her
head
and
i
had
to
make
a
violent
effort
to
prevent
myself
from
actually
beating
her
after
we
had
wrangled
for
an
hour
i
went
off
in
a
fury
for
some
time
i
wandered
about
the
town
walking
hither
and
thither
like
a
madman
at
last
i
went
into
a
church
and
getting
into
the
darkest
corner
i
could
find
i
cried
hot
tears
all
at
once
i
heard
a
voice
a
dragoon
in
tears
i
ll
make
a
philter
of
them
i
looked
up
there
was
carmen
in
front
of
me
well
are
you
still
angry
with
me
she
said
i
must
care
for
you
in
spite
of
myself
for
since
you
left
me
i
don
t
know
what
has
been
the
matter
with
me
look
you
it
is
i
who
ask
you
to
come
to
the
del
now
so
we
made
it
up
but
carmen
s
temper
was
like
the
weather
in
our
country
the
storm
is
never
so
close
in
our
mountains
as
when
the
sun
is
at
its
brightest
she
had
promised
to
meet
me
again
at
dorotea
s
but
she
didn
t
come
and
dorotea
began
telling
me
again
that
she
had
gone
off
to
portugal
about
some
gipsy
business
as
experience
had
already
taught
me
how
much
of
that
i
was
to
believe
i
went
about
looking
for
carmen
wherever
i
thought
she
might
be
and
twenty
times
in
every
day
i
walked
through
the
del
one
evening
i
was
with
dorotea
whom
i
had
almost
tamed
by
giving
her
a
glass
of
anisette
now
and
then
when
carmen
walked
in
followed
by
a
young
man
a
lieutenant
in
our
regiment
get
away
at
once
she
said
to
me
in
basque
i
stood
there
dumfounded
my
heart
full
of
rage
what
are
you
doing
here
said
the
lieutenant
to
me
take
yourself
off
get
out
of
i
couldn
t
move
a
step
i
felt
paralyzed
the
officer
grew
angry
and
seeing
i
did
not
go
out
and
had
not
even
taken
off
my
forage
cap
he
caught
me
by
the
collar
and
shook
me
roughly
i
don
t
know
what
i
said
to
him
he
drew
his
sword
and
i
unsheathed
mine
the
old
woman
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
the
lieutenant
gave
me
a
wound
on
the
forehead
of
which
i
still
bear
the
scar
i
made
a
step
backward
and
with
one
jerk
of
my
elbow
i
threw
old
dorotea
down
then
as
the
lieutenant
still
pressed
me
i
turned
the
point
of
my
sword
against
his
body
and
he
ran
upon
it
then
carmen
put
out
the
lamp
and
told
dorotea
in
her
own
language
to
take
to
flight
i
fled
into
the
street
myself
and
began
running
along
i
knew
not
whither
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
one
was
following
me
when
i
came
to
myself
i
discovered
that
carmen
had
never
left
me
great
stupid
of
a
she
said
you
never
make
anything
but
blunders
and
indeed
you
know
i
told
you
i
should
bring
you
bad
luck
but
come
there
s
a
cure
for
everything
when
you
have
a
fleming
from
for
your
love
begin
by
rolling
this
handkerchief
round
your
head
and
throw
me
over
that
belt
of
yours
wait
for
me
in
this
alley
i
ll
be
back
in
two
minutes
de
a
slang
term
for
the
gipsies
roma
does
not
stand
for
the
eternal
city
but
for
the
nation
of
the
or
the
married
folk
a
name
applied
by
the
gipsies
to
themselves
the
first
gipsies
seen
in
spain
probably
came
from
the
low
countries
hence
their
name
of
she
disappeared
and
soon
came
back
bringing
me
a
striped
cloak
which
she
had
gone
to
fetch
i
knew
not
whence
she
made
me
take
off
my
uniform
and
put
on
the
cloak
over
my
shirt
thus
dressed
and
with
the
wound
on
my
head
bound
round
with
the
handkerchief
i
was
tolerably
like
a
valencian
peasant
many
of
whom
come
to
seville
to
sell
a
drink
they
make
out
of
then
she
took
me
to
a
house
very
much
like
dorotea
s
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
lane
here
she
and
another
gipsy
woman
washed
and
dressed
my
wounds
better
than
any
army
surgeon
could
have
done
gave
me
something
i
know
not
what
to
drink
and
finally
made
me
lie
down
on
a
mattress
on
which
i
went
to
sleep
a
bulbous
root
out
of
which
rather
a
pleasant
beverage
is
manufactured
probably
the
woman
had
mixed
one
of
the
soporific
drugs
of
which
they
know
the
secret
in
my
drink
for
i
did
not
wake
up
till
very
late
the
next
day
i
was
rather
feverish
and
had
a
violent
headache
it
was
some
time
before
the
memory
of
the
terrible
scene
in
which
i
had
taken
part
on
the
previous
night
came
back
to
me
after
having
dressed
my
wound
carmen
and
her
friend
squatting
on
their
heels
beside
my
mattress
exchanged
a
few
words
of
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
medical
consultation
then
they
both
of
them
assured
me
that
i
should
soon
be
cured
but
that
i
must
get
out
of
seville
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
for
that
if
i
was
caught
there
i
should
most
undoubtedly
be
shot
my
boy
said
carmen
to
me
you
ll
have
to
do
something
now
that
the
king
won
t
give
you
either
rice
or
you
ll
have
to
think
of
earning
your
livelihood
you
re
too
stupid
for
stealing
but
you
are
brave
and
active
if
you
have
the
pluck
take
yourself
off
to
the
coast
and
turn
smuggler
haven
t
i
promised
to
get
you
hanged
that
s
better
than
being
shot
and
besides
if
you
set
about
it
properly
you
ll
live
like
a
prince
as
long
as
the
and
the
don
t
lay
their
hands
on
your
the
ordinary
food
of
a
spanish
soldier
a
to
steal
cleverly
to
purloin
without
violence
a
sort
of
volunteer
corps
in
this
attractive
guise
did
this
fiend
of
a
girl
describe
the
new
career
she
was
suggesting
to
me
the
only
one
indeed
remaining
now
i
had
incurred
the
penalty
of
death
shall
i
confess
it
sir
she
persuaded
me
without
much
difficulty
this
wild
and
dangerous
life
it
seemed
to
me
would
bind
her
and
me
more
closely
together
in
future
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
make
sure
of
her
love
i
had
often
heard
talk
of
certain
smugglers
who
travelled
about
andalusia
each
riding
a
good
horse
with
his
mistress
behind
him
and
his
blunderbuss
in
his
fist
already
i
saw
myself
trotting
up
and
down
the
world
with
a
pretty
gipsy
behind
me
when
i
mentioned
that
notion
to
her
she
laughed
till
she
had
to
hold
her
sides
and
vowed
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
delightful
as
a
night
spent
camping
in
the
open
air
when
each
retired
with
his
beneath
their
little
tent
made
of
three
hoops
with
a
blanket
thrown
across
them
if
i
take
to
the
mountains
said
i
to
her
i
shall
be
sure
of
you
there
ll
be
no
lieutenant
there
to
go
shares
with
ha
ha
you
re
jealous
she
retorted
so
much
the
worse
for
you
how
can
you
be
such
a
fool
as
that
don
t
you
see
i
must
love
you
because
i
have
never
asked
you
for
money
when
she
said
that
sort
to
thing
i
could
have
strangled
her
to
shorten
the
story
sir
carmen
procured
me
civilian
clothes
disguised
in
which
i
got
out
of
seville
without
being
recognised
i
went
to
jerez
with
a
letter
from
pastia
to
a
dealer
in
anisette
whose
house
was
the
smugglers
i
was
introduced
to
them
and
their
leader
surnamed
enrolled
me
in
his
gang
we
started
for
gaucin
where
i
found
carmen
who
had
told
me
she
would
meet
me
there
in
all
these
expeditions
she
acted
as
spy
for
our
gang
and
she
was
the
best
that
ever
was
seen
she
had
now
just
returned
from
gibraltar
and
had
already
arranged
with
the
captain
of
a
ship
for
a
cargo
of
english
goods
which
we
were
to
receive
on
the
coast
we
went
to
meet
it
near
estepona
we
hid
part
in
the
mountains
and
laden
with
the
rest
we
proceeded
to
ronda
carmen
had
gone
there
before
us
it
was
she
again
who
warned
us
when
we
had
better
enter
the
town
this
first
journey
and
several
subsequent
ones
turned
out
well
i
found
the
smuggler
s
life
pleasanter
than
a
soldier
s
i
could
give
presents
to
carmen
i
had
money
and
i
had
a
mistress
i
felt
little
or
no
remorse
for
as
the
gipsies
say
the
happy
man
never
longs
to
scratch
his
we
were
made
welcome
everywhere
my
comrades
treated
me
well
and
even
showed
me
a
certain
respect
the
reason
of
this
was
that
i
had
killed
my
man
and
that
some
of
them
had
no
exploit
of
that
description
on
their
conscience
but
what
i
valued
most
in
my
new
life
was
that
i
often
saw
carmen
she
showed
me
more
affection
than
ever
nevertheless
she
would
never
admit
before
my
comrades
that
she
was
my
mistress
and
she
had
even
made
me
swear
all
sorts
of
oaths
that
i
would
not
say
anything
about
her
to
them
i
was
so
weak
in
that
creature
s
hands
that
i
obeyed
all
her
whims
and
besides
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
revealed
herself
as
possessing
any
of
the
reserve
of
a
woman
and
i
was
simple
enough
to
believe
she
had
really
cast
off
her
former
habits
our
gang
which
consisted
of
eight
or
ten
men
was
hardly
ever
together
except
at
decisive
moments
and
we
were
usually
scattered
by
twos
and
threes
about
the
towns
and
villages
each
one
of
us
pretended
to
have
some
trade
one
was
a
tinker
another
was
a
groom
i
was
supposed
to
peddle
haberdashery
but
i
hardly
ever
showed
myself
in
large
places
on
account
of
my
unlucky
business
at
seville
one
day
or
rather
one
night
we
were
to
meet
below
veger
and
i
got
there
before
the
others
we
shall
soon
have
a
new
comrade
said
he
carmen
has
just
managed
one
of
her
best
tricks
she
has
contrived
the
escape
of
her
who
was
in
the
at
i
was
already
beginning
to
understand
the
gipsy
language
which
nearly
all
my
comrades
spoke
and
this
word
startled
me
what
her
husband
is
she
married
then
said
i
to
the
captain
yes
he
replied
married
to
garcia
as
cunning
a
gipsy
as
she
is
herself
the
poor
fellow
has
been
at
the
galleys
carmen
has
wheedled
the
surgeon
of
the
to
such
good
purpose
that
she
has
managed
to
get
her
out
of
prison
faith
that
girl
s
worth
her
weight
in
gold
for
two
years
she
has
been
trying
to
contrive
his
escape
but
she
could
do
nothing
until
the
authorities
took
it
into
their
heads
to
change
the
surgeon
she
soon
managed
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
this
new
man
you
may
imagine
how
pleasant
this
news
was
for
me
i
soon
saw
garcia
he
was
the
very
ugliest
brute
that
was
ever
nursed
in
gipsydom
his
skin
was
black
his
soul
was
blacker
and
he
was
altogether
the
most
ruffian
i
ever
came
across
in
my
life
carmen
arrived
with
him
and
when
she
called
him
her
in
my
presence
you
should
have
seen
the
eyes
she
made
at
me
and
the
faces
she
pulled
whenever
garcia
turned
his
head
away
i
was
disgusted
and
never
spoke
a
word
to
her
all
night
the
next
morning
we
had
made
up
our
packs
and
had
already
started
when
we
became
aware
that
we
had
a
dozen
horsemen
on
our
heels
the
braggart
andalusians
who
had
been
boasting
they
would
murder
every
one
who
came
near
them
cut
a
pitiful
figure
at
once
there
was
a
general
rout
garcia
a
fellow
from
ecija
who
was
called
and
carmen
herself
kept
their
wits
about
them
the
rest
forsook
the
mules
and
took
to
the
gorges
where
the
horses
could
not
follow
them
there
was
no
hope
of
saving
the
mules
so
we
hastily
unstrapped
the
best
part
of
our
booty
and
taking
it
on
our
shoulders
we
tried
to
escape
through
the
rocks
down
the
steepest
of
the
slopes
we
threw
our
packs
down
in
front
of
us
and
followed
them
as
best
we
could
slipping
along
on
our
heels
meanwhile
the
enemy
fired
at
us
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
bullets
whistling
around
me
and
i
didn
t
mind
it
very
much
when
there
s
a
woman
looking
on
there
s
no
particular
merit
in
snapping
one
s
fingers
at
death
we
all
escaped
except
the
poor
who
received
a
bullet
wound
in
the
loins
i
threw
away
my
pack
and
tried
to
lift
him
up
idiot
shouted
garcia
what
do
we
want
with
offal
finish
him
off
and
don
t
lose
the
cotton
stockings
drop
him
cried
carmen
i
was
so
exhausted
that
i
was
obliged
to
lay
him
down
for
a
moment
under
a
rock
garcia
came
up
and
fired
his
blunderbuss
full
into
his
face
he
d
be
a
clever
fellow
who
recognised
him
now
said
he
as
he
looked
at
the
face
cut
to
pieces
by
a
dozen
slugs
there
sir
that
s
the
delightful
sort
of
life
i
ve
led
that
night
we
found
ourselves
in
a
thicket
worn
out
with
fatigue
with
nothing
to
eat
and
ruined
by
the
loss
of
our
mules
what
do
you
think
that
devil
garcia
did
he
pulled
a
pack
of
cards
out
of
his
pocket
and
began
playing
games
with
by
the
light
of
a
fire
they
kindled
meanwhile
i
was
lying
down
staring
at
the
stars
thinking
of
and
telling
myself
i
would
just
as
lief
be
in
his
place
carmen
was
squatting
down
near
me
and
every
now
and
then
she
would
rattle
her
castanets
and
hum
a
tune
then
drawing
close
to
me
as
if
she
would
have
whispered
in
my
ear
she
kissed
me
two
or
three
times
over
almost
against
my
will
you
are
a
devil
said
i
to
her
yes
she
replied
after
a
few
hours
rest
she
departed
to
gaucin
and
the
next
morning
a
little
goatherd
brought
us
some
food
we
stayed
there
all
that
day
and
in
the
evening
we
moved
close
to
gaucin
we
were
expecting
news
from
carmen
but
none
came
after
daylight
broke
we
saw
a
muleteer
attending
a
woman
with
a
parasol
and
a
little
girl
who
seemed
to
be
her
servant
said
garcia
there
go
two
mules
and
two
women
whom
nicholas
has
sent
us
i
would
rather
have
had
four
mules
but
no
matter
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
with
he
took
his
blunderbuss
and
went
down
the
pathway
hiding
himself
among
the
brushwood
we
followed
him
and
i
keeping
a
little
way
behind
as
soon
as
the
woman
saw
us
instead
of
being
frightened
and
our
dress
would
have
been
enough
to
frighten
any
one
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
loud
laughter
ah
the
they
take
me
for
an
the
idiots
they
take
me
for
a
smart
lady
it
was
carmen
but
so
well
disguised
that
if
she
had
spoken
any
other
language
i
should
never
have
recognised
her
she
sprang
off
her
mule
and
talked
some
time
in
an
undertone
with
and
garcia
then
she
said
to
me
we
shall
meet
again
before
you
re
hanged
i
m
off
to
gibraltar
on
gipsy
business
you
ll
soon
have
news
of
we
parted
after
she
had
told
us
of
a
place
where
we
should
find
shelter
for
some
days
that
girl
was
the
providence
of
our
gang
we
soon
received
some
money
sent
by
her
and
a
piece
of
news
which
was
still
more
useful
to
us
to
the
effect
that
on
a
certain
day
two
english
lords
would
travel
from
gibraltar
to
granada
by
a
road
she
mentioned
this
was
a
word
to
the
wise
they
had
plenty
of
good
guineas
garcia
would
have
killed
them
but
and
i
objected
all
we
took
from
them
besides
their
shirts
which
we
greatly
needed
was
their
money
and
their
watches
sir
a
man
may
turn
rogue
in
sheer
thoughtlessness
you
lose
your
head
over
a
pretty
girl
you
fight
another
man
about
her
there
is
a
catastrophe
you
have
to
take
to
the
mountains
and
you
turn
from
a
smuggler
into
a
robber
before
you
have
time
to
think
about
it
after
this
matter
of
the
english
lords
we
concluded
that
the
neighbourhood
of
gibraltar
would
not
be
healthy
for
us
and
we
plunged
into
the
de
you
once
mentioned
to
me
well
it
was
there
i
made
acquaintance
with
him
he
always
took
his
mistress
with
him
on
his
expeditions
she
was
a
pretty
girl
quiet
modest
you
never
heard
a
vulgar
word
from
her
and
she
was
quite
devoted
to
him
he
on
his
side
led
her
a
very
unhappy
life
he
was
always
running
after
other
women
he
her
and
then
sometimes
he
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
be
jealous
one
day
he
slashed
her
with
a
knife
well
she
only
doted
on
him
the
more
that
s
the
way
with
women
and
especially
with
andalusians
this
girl
was
proud
of
the
scar
on
her
arm
and
would
display
it
as
though
it
were
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
and
then
was
the
worst
of
comrades
in
the
bargain
in
one
expedition
we
made
with
him
he
managed
so
that
he
kept
all
the
profits
and
we
had
all
the
trouble
and
the
blows
but
i
must
go
back
to
my
story
we
had
no
sign
at
all
from
carmen
said
one
of
us
will
have
to
go
to
gibraltar
to
get
news
of
her
she
must
have
planned
some
business
i
d
go
at
once
only
i
m
too
well
known
at
said
i
m
well
known
there
too
i
ve
played
so
many
tricks
on
the
and
as
i
ve
only
one
eye
it
is
not
overeasy
for
me
to
disguise
name
applied
by
the
spanish
populace
to
the
british
soldiers
on
account
of
the
colour
of
their
uniform
then
i
suppose
i
must
go
said
i
delighted
at
the
very
idea
of
seeing
carmen
again
well
how
am
i
to
set
about
it
the
others
answered
you
must
either
go
by
sea
or
you
must
get
through
by
san
rocco
whichever
you
like
the
best
once
you
are
in
gibraltar
inquire
in
the
port
where
a
called
lives
when
you
ve
found
her
she
ll
tell
you
everything
that
s
it
was
settled
that
we
were
all
to
start
for
the
sierra
that
i
was
to
leave
my
two
companions
there
and
take
my
way
to
gibraltar
in
the
character
of
a
at
ronda
one
of
our
men
procured
me
a
passport
at
gaucin
i
was
provided
with
a
donkey
i
loaded
it
with
oranges
and
melons
and
started
forth
when
i
reached
gibraltar
i
found
that
many
people
knew
but
that
she
was
either
dead
or
had
gone
finibus
and
to
my
mind
her
disappearance
explained
the
failure
of
our
correspondence
with
carmen
i
stabled
my
donkey
and
began
to
move
about
the
town
carrying
my
oranges
as
though
to
sell
them
but
in
reality
looking
to
see
whether
i
could
not
come
across
any
face
i
knew
the
place
is
full
of
ragamuffins
from
every
country
in
the
world
and
it
really
is
like
the
tower
of
babel
for
you
can
t
go
ten
paces
along
a
street
without
hearing
as
many
languages
i
did
see
some
gipsies
but
i
hardly
dared
confide
in
them
i
was
taking
stock
of
them
and
they
were
taking
stock
of
me
we
had
mutually
guessed
each
other
to
be
rogues
but
the
important
thing
for
us
was
to
know
whether
we
belonged
to
the
same
gang
after
having
spent
two
days
in
fruitless
wanderings
and
having
found
out
nothing
either
as
to
or
as
to
carmen
i
was
thinking
i
would
go
back
to
my
comrades
as
soon
as
i
had
made
a
few
purchases
when
toward
sunset
as
i
was
walking
along
a
street
i
heard
a
woman
s
voice
from
a
window
say
to
the
galleys
or
else
to
all
the
devils
in
hell
i
looked
up
and
on
a
balcony
i
saw
carmen
looking
out
beside
a
officer
with
gold
epaulettes
curly
hair
and
all
the
appearance
of
a
rich
as
for
her
she
was
magnificently
dressed
a
shawl
hung
on
her
shoulders
she
d
a
gold
comb
in
her
hair
everything
she
wore
was
of
silk
and
the
cunning
little
wretch
not
a
bit
altered
was
laughing
till
she
held
her
sides
the
englishman
shouted
to
me
in
mangled
spanish
to
come
upstairs
as
the
lady
wanted
some
oranges
and
carmen
said
to
me
in
basque
come
up
and
don
t
look
astonished
at
anything
indeed
nothing
that
she
did
ought
ever
to
have
astonished
me
i
don
t
know
whether
i
was
most
happy
or
wretched
at
seeing
her
again
at
the
door
of
the
house
there
was
a
tall
english
servant
with
a
powdered
head
who
ushered
me
into
a
splendid
instantly
carmen
said
to
me
in
basque
you
don
t
know
one
word
of
spanish
and
you
don
t
know
then
turning
to
the
englishman
she
added
i
told
you
so
i
saw
at
once
he
was
a
basque
now
you
ll
hear
what
a
queer
language
he
speaks
doesn
t
he
look
silly
he
s
like
a
cat
that
s
been
caught
in
the
larder
and
you
said
i
to
her
in
my
own
language
you
look
like
an
impudent
jade
and
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
scar
your
face
here
and
now
before
your
my
spark
said
she
why
you
ve
guessed
that
all
alone
are
you
jealous
of
this
idiot
you
re
even
sillier
than
you
were
before
our
evening
in
the
del
don
t
you
see
fool
that
at
this
moment
i
m
doing
gipsy
business
and
doing
it
in
the
most
brilliant
manner
this
house
belongs
to
me
the
guineas
of
that
crayfish
will
belong
to
me
i
lead
him
by
the
nose
and
i
ll
lead
him
to
a
place
that
he
ll
never
get
out
of
and
if
i
catch
you
doing
any
gipsy
business
in
this
style
again
i
ll
see
to
it
that
you
never
do
any
again
said
i
ah
upon
my
word
are
you
my
pray
that
you
give
me
orders
if
is
pleased
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
oughtn
t
you
to
be
very
happy
that
you
are
the
only
man
who
can
call
himself
my
my
lover
or
rather
my
what
does
he
say
inquired
the
englishman
he
says
he
s
thirsty
and
would
like
a
drink
answered
carmen
and
she
threw
herself
back
upon
a
sofa
screaming
with
laughter
at
her
own
translation
when
that
girl
begins
to
laugh
sir
it
was
hopeless
for
anybody
to
try
and
talk
sense
everybody
laughed
with
her
the
big
englishman
began
to
laugh
too
like
the
idiot
he
was
and
ordered
the
servant
to
bring
me
something
to
drink
while
i
was
drinking
she
said
to
me
do
you
see
that
ring
he
has
on
his
finger
if
you
like
i
ll
give
it
to
and
i
answered
i
would
give
one
of
my
fingers
to
have
your
out
on
the
mountains
and
each
of
us
with
a
in
his
what
does
that
mean
asked
the
englishman
maquila
said
carmen
still
laughing
means
an
orange
isn
t
it
a
queer
word
for
an
orange
he
says
he
d
like
you
to
eat
does
he
said
the
englishman
very
well
bring
more
while
we
were
talking
a
servant
came
in
and
said
dinner
was
ready
then
the
englishman
stood
up
gave
me
a
piastre
and
offered
his
arm
to
carmen
as
if
she
couldn
t
have
walked
alone
carmen
who
was
still
laughing
said
to
me
my
boy
i
can
t
ask
you
to
dinner
but
as
soon
as
you
hear
the
drums
beat
for
parade
come
here
with
your
oranges
you
ll
find
a
better
furnished
room
than
the
one
in
the
del
and
you
ll
see
whether
i
am
still
your
then
afterwards
we
ll
talk
about
gipsy
i
gave
her
no
answer
even
when
i
was
in
the
street
i
could
hear
the
englishman
shouting
bring
more
and
carmen
s
peals
of
laughter
i
went
out
not
knowing
what
i
should
do
i
hardly
slept
and
next
morning
i
was
so
enraged
with
the
treacherous
creature
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
gibraltar
without
seeing
her
again
but
the
moment
the
drums
began
to
roll
my
courage
failed
me
i
took
up
my
net
full
of
oranges
and
hurried
off
to
carmen
s
house
her
had
been
pulled
apart
a
little
and
i
saw
her
great
dark
eyes
watching
for
me
the
powdered
servant
showed
me
in
at
once
carmen
sent
him
out
with
a
message
and
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
she
burst
into
one
of
her
fits
of
crocodile
laughter
and
threw
her
arms
around
my
neck
never
had
i
seen
her
look
so
beautiful
she
was
dressed
out
like
a
queen
and
scented
she
had
silken
furniture
embroidered
curtains
and
i
togged
out
like
the
thief
i
was
said
carmen
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
smash
up
everything
here
set
fire
to
the
house
and
take
myself
off
to
the
and
then
she
would
fondle
me
and
then
she
would
laugh
and
she
danced
about
and
tore
up
her
fripperies
never
did
monkey
gambol
nor
make
such
faces
nor
play
such
wild
tricks
as
she
did
that
day
when
she
had
recovered
her
gravity
hark
she
said
this
is
gipsy
business
i
mean
him
to
take
me
to
ronda
where
i
have
a
sister
who
is
a
nun
here
she
shrieked
with
laughter
again
we
shall
pass
by
a
particular
spot
which
i
shall
make
known
to
you
then
you
must
fall
upon
him
and
strip
him
to
the
skin
your
best
plan
would
be
to
do
for
him
but
she
added
with
a
certain
fiendish
smile
of
hers
which
no
one
who
saw
it
ever
had
any
desire
to
imitate
do
you
know
what
you
had
better
do
let
come
up
in
front
of
you
you
keep
a
little
behind
the
crayfish
is
brave
and
skilful
too
and
he
has
good
pistols
do
you
understand
and
she
broke
off
with
another
fit
of
laughter
that
made
me
shiver
no
said
i
i
hate
garcia
but
he
s
my
comrade
some
day
maybe
i
ll
rid
you
of
him
but
we
ll
settle
our
account
after
the
fashion
of
my
country
it
s
only
chance
that
has
made
me
a
gipsy
and
in
certain
things
i
shall
always
be
a
thorough
navarrese
as
the
proverb
says
you
re
a
fool
she
rejoined
a
simpleton
a
regular
you
re
just
like
the
dwarf
who
thinks
himself
tall
because
he
can
spit
a
long
way
you
don
t
love
me
be
off
with
you
esorjle
de
or
marsichisle
sin
chisnar
the
promise
of
a
dwarf
is
that
he
will
spit
a
long
a
gipsy
proverb
whenever
she
said
to
me
be
off
with
you
i
couldn
t
go
away
i
promised
i
would
start
back
to
my
comrades
and
wait
the
arrival
of
the
englishman
she
on
her
side
promised
she
would
be
ill
until
she
left
gibraltar
for
ronda
i
remained
at
gibraltar
two
days
longer
she
had
the
boldness
to
disguise
herself
and
come
and
see
me
at
the
inn
i
departed
i
had
a
plan
of
my
own
i
went
back
to
our
with
the
information
as
to
the
spot
and
the
hour
at
which
the
englishman
and
carmen
were
to
pass
by
i
found
and
garcia
waiting
for
me
we
spent
the
night
in
a
wood
beside
a
fire
made
of
that
blazed
splendidly
i
suggested
to
garcia
that
we
should
play
cards
and
he
agreed
in
the
second
game
i
told
him
he
was
cheating
he
began
to
laugh
i
threw
the
cards
in
his
face
he
tried
to
get
at
his
blunderbuss
i
set
my
foot
on
it
and
said
they
say
you
can
use
a
knife
as
well
as
the
best
ruffian
in
malaga
will
you
try
it
with
me
tried
to
part
us
i
had
given
garcia
one
or
two
cuffs
his
rage
had
given
him
courage
he
drew
his
knife
and
i
drew
mine
we
both
of
us
told
he
must
leave
us
alone
and
let
us
fight
it
out
he
saw
there
was
no
means
of
stopping
us
so
he
stood
on
one
side
garcia
was
already
bent
double
like
a
cat
ready
to
spring
upon
a
mouse
he
held
his
hat
in
his
left
hand
to
parry
with
and
his
knife
in
front
of
him
that
s
their
andalusian
guard
i
stood
up
in
the
navarrese
fashion
with
my
left
arm
raised
my
left
leg
forward
and
my
knife
held
straight
along
my
right
thigh
i
felt
i
was
stronger
than
any
giant
he
flew
at
me
like
an
arrow
i
turned
round
on
my
left
foot
so
that
he
found
nothing
in
front
of
him
but
i
thrust
him
in
the
throat
and
the
knife
went
in
so
far
that
my
hand
was
under
his
chin
i
gave
the
blade
such
a
twist
that
it
broke
that
was
the
end
the
blade
was
carried
out
of
the
wound
by
a
gush
of
blood
as
thick
as
my
arm
and
he
fell
full
length
on
his
face
what
have
you
done
said
to
me
hark
ye
said
i
we
couldn
t
live
on
together
i
love
carmen
and
i
mean
to
be
the
only
one
and
besides
garcia
was
a
villain
i
remember
what
he
did
to
that
poor
there
are
only
two
of
us
left
now
but
we
are
both
good
fellows
come
will
you
have
me
for
your
friend
for
life
or
death
stretched
out
his
hand
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
devil
take
these
love
stories
he
cried
if
you
d
asked
him
for
carmen
he
d
have
sold
her
to
you
for
a
piastre
there
are
only
two
of
us
now
how
shall
we
manage
for
i
ll
manage
it
all
alone
i
answered
i
can
snap
my
fingers
at
the
whole
world
we
buried
garcia
and
we
moved
our
camp
two
hundred
paces
farther
on
the
next
morning
carmen
and
her
englishman
came
along
with
two
muleteers
and
a
servant
i
said
to
i
ll
look
after
the
englishman
you
frighten
the
others
they
re
not
armed
the
englishman
was
a
plucky
fellow
he
d
have
killed
me
if
carmen
hadn
t
jogged
his
elbow
to
put
it
shortly
i
won
carmen
back
that
day
and
my
first
words
were
to
tell
her
she
was
a
widow
when
she
knew
how
it
had
all
happened
you
ll
always
be
a
she
said
garcia
ought
to
have
killed
you
your
navarrese
guard
is
a
pack
of
nonsense
and
he
has
sent
far
more
skilful
men
than
you
into
the
darkness
it
was
just
that
his
time
had
come
and
yours
will
come
ay
and
yours
too
if
you
re
not
a
faithful
to
so
be
it
said
she
i
ve
read
in
the
coffee
grounds
more
than
once
that
you
and
i
were
to
end
our
lives
together
pshaw
what
must
be
will
be
and
she
rattled
her
castanets
as
was
her
way
when
she
wanted
to
drive
away
some
worrying
thought
one
runs
on
when
one
is
talking
about
one
s
self
i
dare
say
all
these
details
bore
you
but
i
shall
soon
be
at
the
end
of
my
story
our
new
life
lasted
for
some
considerable
time
and
i
gathered
a
few
comrades
about
us
who
were
more
trustworthy
than
our
earlier
ones
and
we
turned
our
attention
to
smuggling
occasionally
indeed
i
must
confess
we
stopped
travellers
on
the
highways
but
never
unless
we
were
at
the
last
extremity
and
could
not
avoid
doing
so
and
besides
we
never
the
travellers
and
confined
ourselves
to
taking
their
money
from
them
for
some
months
i
was
very
well
satisfied
with
carmen
she
still
served
us
in
our
smuggling
operations
by
giving
us
notice
of
any
opportunity
of
making
a
good
haul
she
remained
either
at
malaga
at
cordova
or
at
granada
but
at
a
word
from
me
she
would
leave
everything
and
come
to
meet
me
at
some
or
even
in
our
lonely
camp
only
once
it
was
at
malaga
she
caused
me
some
uneasiness
i
heard
she
had
fixed
her
fancy
upon
a
very
rich
merchant
with
whom
she
probably
proposed
to
play
her
gibraltar
trick
over
again
in
spite
of
everything
said
to
stop
me
i
started
off
walked
into
malaga
in
broad
daylight
sought
for
carmen
and
carried
her
off
instantly
we
had
a
sharp
altercation
do
you
know
said
she
now
that
you
re
my
for
good
and
all
i
don
t
care
for
you
so
much
as
when
you
were
my
i
won
t
be
worried
and
above
all
i
won
t
be
ordered
about
i
choose
to
be
free
to
do
as
i
like
take
care
you
don
t
drive
me
too
far
if
you
tire
me
out
i
ll
find
some
good
fellow
who
ll
serve
you
just
as
you
served
patched
it
up
between
us
but
we
had
said
things
to
each
other
that
rankled
in
our
hearts
and
we
were
not
as
we
had
been
before
shortly
after
that
we
had
a
misfortune
the
soldiers
caught
us
and
two
of
my
comrades
were
killed
two
others
were
taken
i
was
sorely
wounded
and
but
for
my
good
horse
i
should
have
fallen
into
the
soldiers
hands
half
dead
with
fatigue
and
with
a
bullet
in
my
body
i
sought
shelter
in
a
wood
with
my
only
remaining
comrade
when
i
got
off
my
horse
i
fainted
away
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
there
in
the
brushwood
like
a
shot
hare
my
comrade
carried
me
to
a
cave
he
knew
of
and
then
he
sent
to
fetch
carmen
she
was
at
granada
and
she
hurried
to
me
at
once
for
a
whole
fortnight
she
never
left
me
for
a
single
instant
she
never
closed
her
eyes
she
nursed
me
with
a
skill
and
care
such
as
no
woman
ever
showed
to
the
man
she
loved
most
tenderly
as
soon
as
i
could
stand
on
my
feet
she
conveyed
me
with
the
utmost
secrecy
to
granada
these
gipsy
women
find
safe
shelter
everywhere
and
i
spent
more
than
six
weeks
in
a
house
only
two
doors
from
that
of
the
who
was
trying
to
arrest
me
more
than
once
i
saw
him
pass
by
from
behind
the
shutter
at
last
i
recovered
but
i
had
thought
a
great
deal
on
my
bed
of
pain
and
i
had
planned
to
change
my
way
of
life
i
suggested
to
carmen
that
we
should
leave
spain
and
seek
an
honest
livelihood
in
the
new
world
she
laughed
in
my
face
we
were
not
born
to
plant
cabbages
she
cried
our
fate
is
to
live
listen
i
ve
arranged
a
business
with
nathan
at
gibraltar
he
has
cotton
stuffs
that
he
can
not
get
through
till
you
come
to
fetch
them
he
knows
you
re
alive
and
reckons
upon
you
what
would
our
gibraltar
correspondents
say
if
you
failed
them
i
let
myself
by
persuaded
and
took
up
my
vile
trade
once
more
while
i
was
hiding
at
granada
there
were
there
to
which
carmen
went
when
she
came
back
she
talked
a
great
deal
about
a
skilful
of
the
name
of
lucas
she
knew
the
name
of
his
horse
and
how
much
his
embroidered
jacket
had
cost
him
i
paid
no
attention
to
this
but
a
few
days
later
juanito
the
only
one
of
my
comrades
who
was
left
told
me
he
had
seen
carmen
with
lucas
in
a
shop
in
the
zacatin
then
i
began
to
feel
alarmed
i
asked
carmen
how
and
why
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
he
s
a
man
out
of
whom
we
may
be
able
to
get
something
said
she
a
noisy
stream
has
either
water
in
it
or
pebbles
he
has
earned
twelve
hundred
reals
at
the
it
must
be
one
of
two
things
we
must
either
have
his
money
or
else
as
he
is
a
good
rider
and
a
plucky
fellow
we
can
enroll
him
in
our
gang
we
have
lost
such
an
one
an
such
an
one
you
ll
have
to
replace
them
take
this
man
with
you
i
want
neither
his
money
nor
himself
i
replied
and
i
forbid
you
to
speak
to
beware
she
retorted
if
any
one
defies
me
to
do
a
thing
it
s
very
quickly
luckily
the
departed
to
malaga
and
i
set
about
passing
in
the
jew
s
cotton
stuffs
this
expedition
gave
me
a
great
deal
to
do
and
carmen
as
well
i
forgot
lucas
and
perhaps
she
forgot
him
too
for
the
moment
at
all
events
it
was
just
about
that
time
sir
that
i
met
you
first
at
montilla
and
then
afterward
at
cordova
i
won
t
talk
about
that
last
interview
you
know
more
about
it
perhaps
than
i
do
carmen
stole
your
watch
from
you
she
wanted
to
have
your
money
besides
and
especially
that
ring
i
see
on
your
finger
and
which
she
declared
to
be
a
magic
ring
the
possession
of
which
was
very
important
to
her
we
had
a
violent
quarrel
and
i
struck
her
she
turned
pale
and
began
to
cry
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
her
cry
and
it
affected
me
in
the
most
painful
manner
i
begged
her
to
forgive
me
but
she
sulked
with
me
for
a
whole
day
and
when
i
started
back
to
montilla
she
wouldn
t
kiss
me
my
heart
was
still
very
sore
when
three
days
later
she
joined
me
with
a
smiling
face
and
as
merry
as
a
lark
everything
was
forgotten
and
we
were
like
a
pair
of
honeymoon
lovers
just
as
we
were
parting
she
said
there
s
a
at
cordova
i
shall
go
and
see
it
and
then
i
shall
know
what
people
will
be
coming
away
with
money
and
i
can
warn
i
let
her
go
when
i
was
alone
i
thought
about
the
and
about
the
change
in
carmen
s
temper
she
must
have
avenged
herself
already
said
i
to
myself
since
she
was
the
first
to
make
our
quarrel
a
peasant
told
me
there
was
to
be
at
cordova
then
my
blood
began
to
boil
and
i
went
off
like
a
madman
straight
to
the
i
had
lucas
pointed
out
to
me
and
on
the
bench
just
beside
the
barrier
i
recognised
carmen
one
glance
at
her
was
enough
to
turn
my
suspicion
into
certainty
when
the
first
bull
appeared
lucas
began
as
i
had
expected
to
play
the
agreeable
he
snatched
the
cockade
off
the
bull
and
presented
it
to
carmen
who
put
it
in
her
hair
at
once
a
knot
of
ribbon
the
colour
of
which
indicates
the
pasturage
from
which
each
bull
comes
this
knot
of
ribbon
is
fastened
into
the
bull
s
hide
with
a
sort
of
hook
and
it
is
considered
the
very
height
of
gallantry
to
snatch
it
off
the
living
beast
and
present
it
to
a
woman
the
bull
avenged
me
lucas
was
knocked
down
with
his
horse
on
his
chest
and
the
bull
on
top
of
both
of
them
i
looked
for
carmen
she
had
disappeared
from
her
place
already
i
couldn
t
get
out
of
mine
and
i
was
obliged
to
wait
until
the
was
over
then
i
went
off
to
that
house
you
already
know
and
waited
there
quietly
all
that
evening
and
part
of
the
night
toward
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
carmen
came
back
and
was
rather
surprised
to
see
me
come
with
me
said
i
very
well
said
she
let
s
be
i
went
and
got
my
horse
and
took
her
up
behind
me
and
we
travelled
all
the
rest
of
the
night
without
saying
a
word
to
each
other
when
daylight
came
we
stopped
at
a
lonely
inn
not
far
from
a
hermitage
there
i
said
to
carmen
listen
i
forget
everything
i
won
t
mention
anything
to
you
but
swear
one
thing
to
me
that
you
ll
come
with
me
to
america
and
live
there
quietly
no
said
she
in
a
sulky
voice
i
won
t
go
to
america
i
am
very
well
that
s
because
you
re
near
lucas
but
be
very
sure
that
even
if
he
gets
well
now
he
won
t
make
old
bones
and
indeed
why
should
i
quarrel
with
him
i
m
tired
of
killing
all
your
lovers
i
ll
kill
you
this
she
looked
at
me
steadily
with
her
wild
eyes
and
then
she
said
i
ve
always
thought
you
would
kill
me
the
very
first
time
i
saw
you
i
had
just
met
a
priest
at
the
door
of
my
house
and
as
we
were
going
out
of
cordova
didn
t
you
see
anything
a
hare
ran
across
the
road
between
your
horse
s
feet
it
is
carmencita
i
asked
don
t
you
love
me
any
more
she
gave
me
no
answer
she
was
sitting
on
a
mat
making
marks
on
the
ground
with
her
finger
let
us
change
our
life
carmen
said
i
imploringly
let
us
go
away
and
live
somewhere
we
shall
never
be
parted
you
know
we
have
a
hundred
and
twenty
gold
ounces
buried
under
an
oak
not
far
from
here
and
then
we
have
more
money
with
the
she
began
to
smile
and
then
she
said
me
first
and
then
you
i
know
it
will
happen
like
think
about
it
said
i
i
ve
come
to
the
end
of
my
patience
and
my
courage
make
up
your
mind
or
else
i
must
make
up
i
left
her
alone
and
walked
toward
the
hermitage
i
found
the
hermit
praying
i
waited
till
his
prayer
was
finished
i
longed
to
pray
myself
but
i
couldn
t
when
he
rose
up
from
his
knees
i
went
to
him
father
i
said
will
you
pray
for
some
one
who
is
in
great
danger
i
pray
for
every
one
who
is
afflicted
he
replied
can
you
say
a
mass
for
a
soul
which
is
perhaps
about
to
go
into
the
presence
of
its
maker
yes
he
answered
looking
hard
at
me
and
as
there
was
something
strange
about
me
he
tried
to
make
me
talk
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
seen
you
somewhere
said
he
i
laid
a
piastre
on
his
bench
when
shall
you
say
the
mass
said
i
in
half
an
hour
the
son
of
the
innkeeper
yonder
is
coming
to
serve
it
tell
me
young
man
haven
t
you
something
on
your
conscience
that
is
tormenting
you
will
you
listen
to
a
christian
s
counsel
i
could
hardly
restrain
my
tears
i
told
him
i
would
come
back
and
hurried
away
i
went
and
lay
down
on
the
grass
until
i
heard
the
bell
then
i
went
back
to
the
chapel
but
i
stayed
outside
it
when
he
had
said
the
mass
i
went
back
to
the
i
was
hoping
carmen
would
have
fled
she
could
have
taken
my
horse
and
ridden
away
but
i
found
her
there
still
she
did
not
choose
that
any
one
should
say
i
had
frightened
her
while
i
had
been
away
she
had
unfastened
the
hem
of
her
gown
and
taken
out
the
lead
that
weighted
it
and
now
she
was
sitting
before
a
table
looking
into
a
bowl
of
water
into
which
she
had
just
thrown
the
lead
she
had
melted
she
was
so
busy
with
her
spells
that
at
first
she
didn
t
notice
my
return
sometimes
she
would
take
out
a
bit
of
lead
and
turn
it
round
every
way
with
a
melancholy
look
sometimes
she
would
sing
one
of
those
magic
songs
which
invoke
the
help
of
maria
padella
don
pedro
s
mistress
who
is
said
to
have
been
the
the
great
gipsy
queen
maria
padella
was
accused
of
having
bewitched
don
pedro
according
to
one
popular
tradition
she
presented
queen
blanche
of
bourbon
with
a
golden
girdle
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
bewitched
king
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
living
snake
hence
the
repugnance
he
always
showed
toward
the
unhappy
princess
carmen
i
said
to
her
will
you
come
with
me
she
rose
threw
away
her
wooden
bowl
and
put
her
mantilla
over
her
head
ready
to
start
my
horse
was
led
up
she
mounted
behind
me
and
we
rode
away
after
we
had
gone
a
little
distance
i
said
to
her
so
my
carmen
you
are
quite
ready
to
follow
me
isn
t
that
so
she
answered
yes
i
ll
follow
you
even
to
death
but
i
won
t
live
with
you
any
we
had
reached
a
lonely
gorge
i
stopped
my
horse
is
this
the
place
she
said
and
with
a
spring
she
reached
the
ground
she
took
off
her
mantilla
and
threw
it
at
her
feet
and
stood
motionless
with
one
hand
on
her
hip
looking
at
me
steadily
you
mean
to
kill
me
i
see
that
well
said
she
it
is
fate
but
you
ll
never
make
me
give
i
said
to
her
be
rational
i
implore
you
listen
to
me
all
the
past
is
forgotten
yet
you
know
it
is
you
who
have
been
my
ruin
it
is
because
of
you
that
i
am
a
robber
and
a
murderer
carmen
my
carmen
let
me
save
you
and
save
myself
with
jose
she
answered
what
you
ask
is
impossible
i
don
t
love
you
any
more
you
love
me
still
and
that
is
why
you
want
to
kill
me
if
i
liked
i
might
tell
you
some
other
lie
but
i
don
t
choose
to
give
myself
the
trouble
everything
is
over
between
us
two
you
are
my
and
you
have
the
right
to
kill
your
but
carmen
will
always
be
free
a
she
was
born
and
a
she
ll
then
you
love
lucas
i
asked
yes
i
have
loved
him
as
i
loved
you
for
an
instant
less
than
i
loved
you
perhaps
but
now
i
don
t
love
anything
and
i
hate
myself
for
ever
having
loved
i
cast
myself
at
her
feet
i
seized
her
hands
i
watered
them
with
my
tears
i
reminded
her
of
all
the
happy
moments
we
had
spent
together
i
offered
to
continue
my
brigand
s
life
if
that
would
please
her
everything
sir
everything
i
offered
her
everything
if
she
would
only
love
me
again
she
said
love
you
again
that
s
not
possible
live
with
you
i
will
not
do
it
i
was
wild
with
fury
i
drew
my
knife
i
would
have
had
her
look
frightened
and
sue
for
mercy
but
that
woman
was
a
demon
i
cried
for
the
last
time
i
ask
you
will
you
stay
with
me
no
no
no
she
said
and
she
stamped
her
foot
then
she
pulled
a
ring
i
had
given
her
off
her
finger
and
cast
it
into
the
brushwood
i
struck
her
twice
over
i
had
taken
garcia
s
knife
because
i
had
broken
my
own
at
the
second
thrust
she
fell
without
a
sound
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
still
see
her
great
black
eyes
staring
at
me
then
they
grew
dim
and
the
lids
closed
for
a
good
hour
i
lay
there
prostrate
beside
her
corpse
then
i
recollected
that
carmen
had
often
told
me
that
she
would
like
to
lie
buried
in
a
wood
i
dug
a
grave
for
her
with
my
knife
and
laid
her
in
it
i
hunted
about
a
long
time
for
her
ring
and
i
found
it
at
last
i
put
it
into
the
grave
beside
her
with
a
little
cross
perhaps
i
did
wrong
then
i
got
upon
my
horse
galloped
to
cordova
and
gave
myself
up
at
the
nearest
i
told
them
i
had
killed
carmen
but
i
would
not
tell
them
where
her
body
was
that
hermit
was
a
holy
man
he
prayed
for
her
he
said
a
mass
for
her
soul
poor
child
it
s
the
who
are
to
blame
for
having
brought
her
up
as

should
be
able
to
recognise
a
member
of
the
race
among
a
thousand
other
men
it
is
by
their
physiognomy
and
expression
especially
that
they
differ
from
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
same
country
their
complexion
is
exceedingly
swarthy
always
darker
than
that
of
the
race
among
whom
they
live
hence
the
name
of
blacks
which
they
frequently
apply
to
themselves
their
eyes
set
with
a
decided
slant
are
large
very
black
and
shaded
by
long
and
heavy
lashes
their
glance
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
a
wild
creature
it
is
full
at
once
of
boldness
and
shyness
and
in
this
respect
their
eyes
are
a
fair
indication
of
their
national
character
which
is
cunning
bold
but
with
the
natural
fear
of
blows
like
panurge
most
of
the
men
are
strapping
fellows
slight
and
active
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
a
gipsy
who
had
grown
fat
in
germany
the
gipsy
women
are
often
very
pretty
but
beauty
is
very
uncommon
among
the
spanish
gitanas
when
very
young
they
may
pass
as
being
attractive
in
their
ugliness
but
once
they
have
reached
motherhood
they
become
absolutely
repulsive
the
filthiness
of
both
sexes
is
incredible
and
no
one
who
has
not
seen
a
gipsy
matron
s
hair
can
form
any
conception
of
what
it
is
not
even
if
he
conjures
up
the
roughest
the
greasiest
and
the
dustiest
heads
imaginable
in
some
of
the
large
andalusian
towns
certain
of
the
gipsy
girls
somewhat
better
looking
than
their
fellows
will
take
more
care
of
their
personal
appearance
these
go
out
and
earn
money
by
performing
dances
strongly
resembling
those
forbidden
at
our
public
balls
in
carnival
time
an
english
missionary
mr
borrow
the
author
of
two
very
interesting
works
on
the
spanish
gipsies
whom
he
undertook
to
convert
on
behalf
of
the
bible
society
declares
there
is
no
instance
of
any
gitana
showing
the
smallest
weakness
for
a
man
not
belonging
to
her
own
race
the
praise
he
bestows
upon
their
chastity
strikes
me
as
being
exceedingly
exaggerated
in
the
first
place
the
great
majority
are
in
the
position
of
the
ugly
woman
described
by
ovid
quam
nemo
as
for
the
pretty
ones
they
are
like
all
spanish
women
very
fastidious
in
choosing
their
lovers
their
fancy
must
be
taken
and
their
favour
must
be
earned
mr
borrow
quotes
in
proof
of
their
virtue
one
trait
which
does
honour
to
his
own
and
especially
to
his
simplicity
he
declares
that
an
immoral
man
of
his
acquaintance
offered
several
gold
ounces
to
a
pretty
gitana
and
offered
them
in
vain
an
andalusian
to
whom
i
retailed
this
anecdote
asserted
that
the
immoral
man
in
question
would
have
been
far
more
successful
if
he
had
shown
the
girl
two
or
three
piastres
and
that
to
offer
gold
ounces
to
a
gipsy
was
as
poor
a
method
of
persuasion
as
to
promise
a
couple
of
millions
to
a
tavern
wench
however
that
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
gitana
shows
the
most
extraordinary
devotion
to
her
husband
there
is
no
danger
and
no
suffering
she
will
not
brave
to
help
him
in
his
need
one
of
the
names
which
the
gipsies
apply
to
themselves
or
the
married
couple
seems
to
me
a
proof
of
their
racial
respect
for
the
married
state
speaking
generally
it
may
be
asserted
that
their
chief
virtue
is
their
patriotism
if
we
may
thus
describe
the
fidelity
they
observe
in
all
their
relations
with
persons
of
the
same
origin
as
their
own
their
readiness
to
help
one
another
and
the
inviolable
secrecy
which
they
keep
for
each
other
s
benefit
in
all
compromising
matters
and
indeed
something
of
the
same
sort
may
be
noticed
in
all
mysterious
associations
which
are
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
it
has
struck
me
that
the
german
gipsies
though
they
thoroughly
understand
the
word
do
not
care
to
be
called
by
that
name
among
themselves
they
always
use
the
designation
some
months
ago
i
paid
a
visit
to
a
gipsy
tribe
in
the
vosges
country
in
the
hut
of
an
old
woman
the
oldest
member
of
the
tribe
i
found
a
gipsy
in
no
way
related
to
the
family
who
was
sick
of
a
mortal
disease
the
man
had
left
a
hospital
where
he
was
well
cared
for
so
that
he
might
die
among
his
own
people
for
thirteen
weeks
he
had
been
lying
in
bed
in
their
encampment
and
receiving
far
better
treatment
than
any
of
the
sons
and
who
shared
his
shelter
he
had
a
good
bed
made
of
straw
and
moss
and
sheets
that
were
tolerably
white
whereas
all
the
rest
of
the
family
which
numbered
eleven
persons
slept
on
planks
three
feet
long
so
much
for
their
hospitality
this
very
same
woman
humane
as
was
her
treatment
of
her
guest
said
to
me
constantly
before
the
sick
man
singo
homte
hi
soon
soon
he
must
die
after
all
these
people
live
such
miserable
lives
that
a
reference
to
the
approach
of
death
can
have
no
terrors
for
them
one
remarkable
feature
in
the
gipsy
character
is
their
indifference
about
religion
not
that
they
are
or
sceptical
they
have
never
made
any
profession
of
atheism
far
from
that
indeed
the
religion
of
the
country
which
they
inhabit
is
always
theirs
but
they
change
their
religion
when
they
change
the
country
of
their
residence
they
are
equally
free
from
the
superstitions
which
replace
religious
feeling
in
the
minds
of
the
vulgar
how
indeed
can
superstition
exist
among
a
race
which
as
a
rule
makes
its
livelihood
out
of
the
credulity
of
others
nevertheless
i
have
remarked
a
particular
horror
of
touching
a
corpse
among
the
spanish
gipsies
very
few
of
these
could
be
induced
to
carry
a
dead
man
to
his
grave
even
if
they
were
paid
for
it
i
have
said
that
most
gipsy
women
undertake
to
tell
fortunes
they
do
this
very
successfully
but
they
find
a
much
greater
source
of
profit
in
the
sale
of
charms
and
not
only
do
they
supply
toads
claws
to
hold
fickle
hearts
and
powdered
loadstone
to
kindle
love
in
cold
ones
but
if
necessity
arises
they
can
use
mighty
incantations
which
force
the
devil
to
lend
them
his
aid
last
year
the
following
story
was
related
to
me
by
a
spanish
lady
she
was
walking
one
day
along
the
d
feeling
very
sad
and
anxious
a
gipsy
woman
who
was
squatting
on
the
pavement
called
out
to
her
my
pretty
lady
your
lover
has
played
you
false
it
was
quite
true
shall
i
get
him
back
for
you
my
readers
will
imagine
with
what
joy
the
proposal
was
accepted
and
how
complete
was
the
confidence
inspired
by
a
person
who
could
thus
guess
the
inmost
secrets
of
the
heart
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
proceed
to
perform
the
operations
of
magic
in
the
most
crowded
street
in
madrid
a
meeting
was
arranged
for
the
next
day
nothing
will
be
easier
than
to
bring
back
the
faithless
one
to
your
feet
said
the
gitana
do
you
happen
to
have
a
handkerchief
a
scarf
or
a
mantilla
that
he
gave
you
a
silken
scarf
was
handed
her
now
sew
a
piastre
into
one
corner
of
the
scarf
with
crimson
silk
sew
half
a
piastre
into
another
corner
sew
a
peseta
here
and
a
piece
there
then
in
the
middle
you
must
sew
a
gold
coin
a
doubloon
would
be
the
doubloon
and
all
the
other
coins
were
duly
sewn
in
now
give
me
the
scarf
and
i
ll
take
it
to
the
campo
santo
when
midnight
strikes
you
come
along
with
me
if
you
want
to
see
a
fine
piece
of
witchcraft
i
promise
you
shall
see
the
man
you
love
the
gipsy
departed
alone
for
the
campo
santo
since
my
spanish
friend
was
too
much
afraid
of
witchcraft
to
go
there
with
her
i
leave
my
readers
to
guess
whether
my
poor
forsaken
lady
ever
saw
her
lover
or
her
scarf
again
in
spite
of
their
poverty
and
the
sort
of
aversion
they
inspire
the
gipsies
are
treated
with
a
certain
amount
of
consideration
by
the
more
ignorant
folk
and
they
are
very
proud
of
it
they
feel
themselves
to
be
a
superior
race
as
regards
intelligence
and
they
heartily
despise
the
people
whose
hospitality
they
enjoy
these
gentiles
are
so
stupid
said
one
of
the
vosges
gipsies
to
me
that
there
is
no
credit
in
taking
them
in
the
other
day
a
peasant
woman
called
out
to
me
in
the
street
i
went
into
her
house
her
stove
smoked
and
she
asked
me
to
give
her
a
charm
to
cure
it
first
of
all
i
made
her
give
me
a
good
bit
of
bacon
and
then
i
began
to
mumble
a
few
words
in
you
re
a
fool
i
said
you
were
born
a
fool
and
you
ll
die
a
fool
when
i
had
got
near
the
door
i
said
to
her
in
good
german
the
most
certain
way
of
keeping
your
stove
from
smoking
is
not
to
light
any
fire
in
it
and
then
i
took
to
my
the
history
of
the
gipsies
is
still
a
problem
we
know
indeed
that
their
first
bands
which
were
few
and
far
between
appeared
in
eastern
europe
towards
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
but
nobody
can
tell
whence
they
started
or
why
they
came
to
europe
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
no
one
knows
how
they
multiplied
within
a
short
time
and
in
so
prodigious
a
fashion
and
in
several
countries
all
very
remote
from
each
other
the
gipsies
themselves
have
preserved
no
tradition
whatsoever
as
to
their
origin
and
though
most
of
them
do
speak
of
egypt
as
their
original
fatherland
that
is
only
because
they
have
adopted
a
very
ancient
fable
respecting
their
race
most
of
the
orientalists
who
have
studied
the
gipsy
language
believe
that
the
cradle
of
the
race
was
in
india
it
appears
in
fact
that
many
of
the
roots
and
grammatical
forms
of
the
tongue
are
to
be
found
in
idioms
derived
from
the
sanskrit
as
may
be
imagined
the
gipsies
during
their
long
wanderings
have
adopted
many
foreign
words
in
every
dialect
a
number
of
greek
words
appear
at
the
present
day
the
gipsies
have
almost
as
many
dialects
as
there
are
separate
hordes
of
their
race
everywhere
they
speak
the
language
of
the
country
they
inhabit
more
easily
than
their
own
idiom
which
they
seldom
use
except
with
the
object
of
conversing
freely
before
strangers
a
comparison
of
the
dialect
of
the
german
gipsies
with
that
used
by
the
spanish
gipsies
who
have
held
no
communication
with
each
other
for
several
centuries
reveals
the
existence
of
a
great
number
of
words
common
to
both
but
everywhere
the
original
language
is
notably
affected
though
in
different
degrees
by
its
contact
with
the
more
cultivated
languages
into
the
use
of
which
the
nomads
have
been
forced
german
in
one
case
and
spanish
in
the
other
have
so
modified
the
groundwork
that
it
would
not
be
possible
for
a
gipsy
from
the
black
forest
to
converse
with
one
of
his
andalusian
brothers
although
a
few
sentences
on
each
side
would
suffice
to
convince
them
that
each
was
speaking
a
dialect
of
the
same
language
certain
words
in
very
frequent
use
are
i
believe
common
to
every
dialect
thus
in
every
vocabulary
which
i
have
been
able
to
consult
means
water
means
bread
stands
for
meat
and
for
salt
the
nouns
of
number
are
almost
the
same
in
every
case
the
german
dialect
seems
to
me
much
purer
than
the
spanish
for
it
has
preserved
numbers
of
the
primitive
grammatical
forms
whereas
the
gitanos
have
adopted
those
of
the
castilian
tongue
nevertheless
some
words
are
an
exception
as
though
to
prove
that
the
language
was
originally
common
to
all
the
preterite
of
the
german
dialect
is
formed
by
adding
to
the
imperative
which
is
always
the
root
of
the
verb
in
the
spanish
the
verbs
are
all
conjugated
on
the
model
of
the
first
conjugation
of
the
castilian
verbs
from
the
infinitive
of
to
eat
the
regular
conjugation
should
be
i
have
from
to
take
i
have
yet
some
old
gipsies
say
as
an
exception
and
i
am
not
acquainted
with
any
other
verbs
which
have
preserved
this
ancient
form
while
i
am
thus
showing
off
my
small
acquaintance
with
the
language
i
must
notice
a
few
words
of
french
slang
which
our
thieves
have
borrowed
from
the
gipsies
from
mysteres
de
honest
folk
have
learned
that
the
word
means
a
this
is
pure
is
one
of
the
words
which
is
common
to
every
dialect
monsieur
vidocq
calls
a
horse
this
again
is
a
gipsy
word
and
add
to
this
the
word
by
which
the
gipsies
are
described
in
parisian
slang
this
is
a
corruption
of
gipsy
but
a
piece
of
etymology
of
which
i
am
really
proud
is
that
of
the
word
face
countenance
a
word
which
every
schoolboy
uses
or
did
use
in
my
time
note
in
the
first
place
the
oudin
in
his
curious
dictionary
published
in
wrote
the
word
now
in
or
stands
for
face
and
has
the
same
meaning
it
is
exactly
the
of
the
latins
the
combination
of
was
instantly
understood
by
a
genuine
gipsy
and
i
believe
it
to
be
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
gipsy
language
i
have
surely
said
enough
to
give
the
readers
of
carmen
a
favourable
idea
of
my
studies
i
will
conclude
with
the
following
proverb
which
comes
in
very
appropriately
retudi
panda
nasti
abela
between
closed
lips
no
fly
can
pass
