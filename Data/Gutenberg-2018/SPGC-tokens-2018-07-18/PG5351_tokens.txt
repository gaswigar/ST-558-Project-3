chapter
i
in
the
fircone
tavern
in
the
dark
main
room
of
the
fircone
tavern
the
warm
june
air
seemed
to
have
lost
all
its
delicacy
like
a
degraded
angel
it
was
sodden
through
and
through
as
with
the
lees
of
wine
it
was
stained
and
shamed
with
the
smells
of
hams
and
cheeses
it
was
thick
and
heavy
as
if
with
the
breaths
of
all
the
rogues
and
all
the
vagabonds
that
had
haunted
the
hostelry
from
its
evil
dawn
such
guttering
lights
and
glimmering
flames
as
lit
the
place
for
there
was
a
small
fire
on
the
wide
hearth
in
spite
of
the
fine
weather
peopled
the
gloom
with
fantastic
quivering
shadows
as
of
lean
fingers
that
unfolded
themselves
to
filch
or
clenched
themselves
to
stab
in
the
back
but
its
patrons
seemed
to
like
the
place
well
enough
in
spite
of
its
miasma
and
master
robin
turgis
the
fat
landlord
drowsy
with
his
own
wine
and
dripping
from
the
heat
surveyed
them
complacently
and
wallowed
as
it
were
in
the
rattle
and
clink
of
mug
and
can
the
laughter
and
the
shrill
chatter
crisply
emphasized
by
oaths
which
assured
him
of
the
fircone
popularity
with
its
intimates
master
robin
intelligence
was
limited
his
wit
was
simple
the
processes
of
his
mind
moved
easily
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
the
burgundians
might
be
hammering
with
mailed
fists
at
the
walls
of
paris
the
crown
of
louis
the
eleventh
might
be
falling
from
the
royal
forehead
it
mattered
not
a
jot
to
dishonest
robin
so
long
as
the
fircone
brimmed
with
company
there
was
enough
company
in
the
room
on
this
evening
to
content
even
his
wish
it
was
not
the
kind
of
company
that
a
wise
man
would
desire
to
keep
but
it
delighted
the
innkeeper
for
it
drank
deeply
and
spent
freely
and
in
robin
view
it
was
of
no
more
concern
to
him
how
the
money
that
changed
hands
was
come
by
than
it
was
how
the
profound
potations
might
affect
the
brains
and
stomachs
of
his
clients
if
any
officer
of
the
law
had
questioned
him
as
to
his
association
with
a
certain
mysterious
brotherhood
of
the
cockleshells
whose
plunderings
and
pilferings
were
the
pride
of
the
court
of
miracles
and
the
fear
of
citizens
with
strong
boxes
he
would
have
shrugged
his
fat
shoulders
and
shaken
his
round
head
and
disowned
all
knowledge
of
any
such
unlawful
corporation
yet
his
face
wrinkled
with
smiles
as
his
glance
rested
amiably
upon
the
bodily
presences
of
certain
illustrious
members
of
the
brotherhood
wild
men
in
withered
frippery
to
the
very
bones
they
were
five
in
number
and
four
of
them
were
huddled
round
a
table
in
the
cosiest
corner
of
the
room
the
corner
that
was
sheltered
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
by
the
settle
the
corner
that
was
nearest
to
the
main
door
if
one
desired
as
one
often
did
to
slip
out
in
a
hurry
and
to
the
windows
if
one
desired
as
one
seldom
did
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
robin
turgis
knew
them
all
admired
them
all
feared
them
all
and
yet
he
held
head
against
them
because
his
beaune
wine
was
so
adorable
and
because
he
could
keep
his
own
counsel
slender
rené
de
montigny
in
a
jerkin
of
rubbed
and
faded
purple
velvet
with
his
malign
italianate
face
and
his
delicate
italianate
grace
rotund
guy

bluff
red
and
bald

cholet
tall
and
with
the
figure
of
a
stork
and
the
features
of
a
bird
of
prey
jehan
le
loup
who
looked
as
vulpine
as
his
nickname
these
robin
turgis
eyed
and
catalogued
with
a
kind
of
pride
it
was
a
fearsome
privilege
for
the
fircone
to
boast
such
patronage
on
the
settle
with
his
face
to
the
fire
colin
de
cayeulx
sprawled
in
a
drunken
sleep
forgetting
and
forgotten
a
harmless
looking
looking
knave
who
was
neither
harmless
nor
for
every
man
of
the
gang
there
was
a
woman
and
there
was
a
woman
over
who
was
easily
the
central
star
of
the
flaunting
galaxy
the
shabby
bravery
of
the
men
was
matched
by
the
shabby
bravery
of
five
out
of
the
six
women
gaudy
painted
assertive
strumpets
with
young
fair
shameless
faces
worthy
jills
of
the
jacks
who
cuddled
them
jehanneton
the
fair
denise
blanche
isabeau
and
guillemette
the
landlord
daughter
who
consorted
gaily
enough
with
these
birds
of
a
paradise
but
the
sixth
woman
was
a
bird
of
quite
another
feather
over
all
the
clatter
this
woman
voice
rose
suddenly
as
clear
as
the
call
of
a
thrush
and
the
hot
space
seemed
to
cool
and
the
hot
air
to
clean
as
she
sang
she
who
sang
was
a
girl
of
five
and
twenty
whom
it
had
pleased
to
clothe
her
ripe
womanhood
in
a
habit
that
clasped
her
fine
body
as
close
as
a
second
skin
and
she
might
have
passed
for
a
man
no
otherwhere
than
in
a
madhouse
she
looked
very
charming
in
the
stained
and
faded
daintiness
of
her
male
attire
she
wore
a
green
velvet
doublet
and
green
woollen
hose
with
a
scarlet
girdle
and
pouch
about
her
waist
and
a
scarlet
feather
stuck
defiantly
in
her
green
cap
beneath
which
her
long
fair
hair
tumbled
in
liberal
confusion
about
her
shoulders
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
table
swinging
one
shapely
leg
loose
and
strained
upon
its
fellow
while
she
nursed
her
lute
as
if
it
had
been
a
baby
and
carolled
as
if
there
were
no
other
work
in
the
world
to
do
than
to
sing
the
men
and
women
who
sat
and
sprawled
around
the
table
kept
quiet
listening
to
her
and
staring
at
her
sleepy
colin
pricked
his
ears
robin
turgis
was
alert
to
hear
for
he
knew
that
it
was
worth
while
to
listen
when
huguette
du
hamel
chose
to
sing
robin
turgis
knew
all
about
her
her
gentle
blood
was
wild
blood
and
in
spite
of
her
birth
and
her
name
she
had
drifted
on
the
stream
of
strange
pleasure
to
be
the
idol
of
the
fircone
shrine
her
voice
was
sweet
and
the
tune
had
a
tender
appealing
grace
with
a
little
minor
wail
in
it
that
brought
tears
into
the
singer
eyes
and
she
mouthed
the
words
as
if
she
found
them
sweet
as
honey
and
this
is
what
she
sang
daughters
of
pleasure
one
and
all
of
form
and
feature
delicate
of
bodies
slim
and
bosoms
small
with
feet
and
fingers
white
and
straight
your
eyes
are
bright
your
grace
is
great
to
hold
your
lovers
hearts
in
thrall
use
your
red
lips
before
too
late
love
ere
love
flies
beyond
recall
her
voice
dropped
and
her
fingers
tinkled
over
the
strings
rené
de
montigny
turned
his
dark
face
in
a
sweeping
leer
that
seemed
to
taste
the
familiar
graces
with
gusto
devilish
good
advice
dollies
he
shouted
and
as
he
spoke
he
hugged
the
nearest
girl
close
to
him
and
tilting
up
her
chin
with
his
free
hand
kissed
her
noisily
the
girl
squealed
a
little
at
his
roughness
the
other
pairs
laughed
and
clasped
after
his
example
only
the
singer
unheeding
lifted
her
sweet
voice
again
and
this
time
there
was
a
savour
of
gall
in
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
for
soon
the
golden
hair
is
grey
and
all
the
body
lovely
line
in
wrinkled
meanness
slipped
astray
the
limbs
so
round
and
ripe
and
fine
shrivelled
and
withered
quenched
the
shine
that
made
your
eyes
as
bright
as
day
so
ladies
hear
these
words
of
mine
love
ere
love
flutter
far
away
the
drift
of
the
music
seemed
sadder
than
before
and
there
was
a
little
silence
when
the
last
words
floated
away
into
the
blackened
rafters
a
silence
broken
by
one
of
the
girls
enne
that
was
a
sad
song
abbess
isabeau
sighed
and
her
face
seemed
to
have
paled
beneath
its
false
colours
and
the
lines
about
her
mouth
and
eyes
to
have
grown
older
in
surrender
to
inevitable
thoughts
she
whom
the
girl
called
abbess
laughed
and
her
mirth
sounded
harshly
after
the
dreamy
sweetness
of
her
song
master
françois
villon
made
it
for
me
day
she
you
will
grow
old
idol
he
said
i
make
you
this
song
to
teach
you
true
things
guy
tabarie
whose
red
hair
bunched
out
like
little
flames
from
the
fiery
sun
of
his
countenance
clapped
his
hands
to
the
girl
waist
and
thrust
his
face
near
to
hers
kiss
me
and
forget
it
he
hiccoughed
the
girl
gave
importunacy
a
little
push
which
sent
him
staggering
back
to
his
seat
i
have
no
kisses
for
any
jack
of
you
all
but
françois
she
said
while
the
others
roared
at
the
discomfiture
ah
there
is
no
one
of
you
that
can
write
songs
like
him
or
make
one
sad
as
he
can
in
the
midst
of
gladness
the
girl
whom
rené
had
kissed
so
rudely
shivered
a
little
a
strange
reason
for
liking
a
man
she
whispered
that
he
make
you
sad
she
glanced
wistfully
round
at
her
companions
to
the
faces
of
the
women
the
influence
of
the
song
had
lent
an
unwonted
softness
but
had
brought
no
touch
of
tenderness
to
those
of
the
men
jehan
le
loup
banged
his
fist
heavily
on
the
table
in
furious
protestation
till
the
cans
and
flagons
rattled
is
this
a
court
of
love
he
grunted
baring
his
yellow
tusks
in
a
swinish
rage
there
are
other
rooms
for
and
he
jerked
his
thumb
towards
the
roof
we
are
here
for
drinking
we
are
here
for
dicing
to
the
devil
with
smocks
and
sonnets
he
jumbled
the
ivories
lustily
as
he
growled
and
the
familiar
jingle
banished
unfamiliar
fancies
he
slapped
the
spotted
cubes
on
the
table
and
as
they
rolled
into
equilibrium
eager
eyes
counted
them
and
fingers
eager
or
reluctant
pinched
or
pushed
at
coins
the
spell
of
the
music
was
broken
the
melodious
abbess
with
eyes
now
glittering
and
tearless
swung
her
supple
body
from
table
to
bench
thrust
herself
a
place
among
the
players
shouted
to
robin
turgis
to
bring
more
wine
and
spreading
some
silver
on
the
dingy
board
surrendered
to
speculation
nobody
heeded
the
faint
clink
which
told
that
a
hand
troubled
the
latch
of
the
street
door
nobody
heeded
the
faint
creaking
which
showed
that
it
was
being
softly
opened
nobody
heeded
the
man
who
put
his
head
gently
through
the
opening
and
looked
thoughtfully
around
him
the
was
a
fellow
somewhere
near
the
edge
of
middle
age
he
was
dressed
in
the
sober
habit
of
a
simple
burgess
and
he
used
the
long
fold
that
hung
from
his
cloth
cap
very
dexterously
to
hide
his
face
he
peered
into
the
obscurity
of
the
room
with
a
disquieting
smile
that
deepened
in
its
unpleasing
expression
as
its
owner
surveyed
the
noisy
fellowship
in
the
corner
and
nodded
his
head
as
he
seemed
to
identify
its
members
confident
that
nobody
marked
him
he
stealthily
entered
the
room
and
holding
the
door
ajar
he
motioned
to
one
who
still
stood
without
to
enter
the
summons
was
answered
by
the
entrance
of
another
figure
capped
and
habited
like
the
first
who
slipped
in
swiftly
and
furtively
and
made
at
once
for
the
farthest
and
loneliest
angle
of
the
room
without
looking
to
right
or
left
while
his
herald
after
closing
the
door
as
noiselessly
as
possible
followed
quickly
in
his
footsteps
if
master
robin
dancing
attendance
upon
his
clamourous
customers
could
have
divined
the
identity
of
the
newcomers
whose
advent
he
regarded
so
indifferently
his
purple
face
would
have
paled
and
his
stomach
failed
him
at
the
thought
that
the
fircone
sheltered
the
baleful
presence
of
the
king
and
of
his
malign
satellite
tristan
the
two
strangers
seated
themselves
at
a
small
table
in
the
very
pole
of
the
room
to
the
place
where
the
abbess
and
her
friends
were
busy
and
the
second
of
the
pair
drawing
a
little
apart
the
fold
of
cloth
that
almost
concealed
his
features
looked
around
him
curiously
is
this
the
eyrie
he
whispered
and
his
companion
answered
him
in
the
same
low
tone
this
is
the
fircone
tavern
sire
the
finger
was
lifted
to
his
lip
at
once
in
warning
hush
gossip
hush
he
muttered
no
title
now
i
beg
of
you
here
i
am
not
louis
of
france
but
a
simple
sober
citizen
like
yourself
i
suppose
we
must
take
something
for
the
good
of
the
house
his
henchman
promptly
replied
that
such
action
was
indispensable
but
louis
still
looked
doubtful
will
the
liquor
be
very
detestable
he
asked
inserting
two
thin
fingers
in
the
black
pouch
at
his
belt
tristan
shook
his
head
nay
you
can
get
good
wine
here
if
you
know
how
to
ask
for
it
and
how
to
pay
for
it
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
to
ask
for
anything
chuckled
the
king
or
worse
how
to
for
it
tristan
sneered
the
king
scowled
at
him
then
why
do
you
keep
my
service
he
snapped
tristan
shrugged
his
shoulders
some
dregs
of
devotion
i
suppose
here
stands
master
innkeeper
for
by
this
time
robin
turgis
was
at
their
elbow
scanning
them
narrowly
with
his
small
pig
like
eyes
that
could
make
little
however
of
the
faces
he
waited
on
their
order
with
a
kind
of
ferocious
submission
draining
his
rank
forehead
with
a
sweep
of
his
dirty
palm
friend
said
louis
sniffing
sardonically
at
the
too
odoriferous
personality
of
the
taverner
you
behold
here
two
decent
cits
who
have
turned
a
penny
or
twain
in
a
bargain
and
have
a
mind
to
wet
their
whistles
in
consequence
have
you
aught
to
offer
that
is
good
alike
for
purse
and
palate
robin
turgis
nodded
his
round
head
and
fondled
his
round
stomach
we
have
a
white
wine
of
beaune
he
said
unctuously
as
if
he
were
tasting
the
wares
he
commended
at
two
sols
the
flagon
that
is
noble
drinking
the
king
sense
of
economy
shivered
at
the
sum
as
if
it
had
been
a
wound
he
stammered
so
it
should
be
at
the
price
robin
turgis
remained
unmoved
tristan
clinched
the
business
bring
it
he
said
decisively
and
as
the
landlord
shambled
away
towards
his
cellar
tristan
met
the
king
condemnatory
frown
squarely
i
wear
out
my
hands
and
feet
in
your
service
lie
said
i
want
to
save
my
throat
and
stomach
louis
made
no
answer
and
was
mournfully
silent
until
the
obese
landlord
returned
with
the
vintage
which
he
set
down
on
the
table
with
a
brace
of
goblets
louis
fumbled
with
reluctant
fingers
in
his
pouch
extracted
the
exact
amount
necessary
for
payment
and
dropped
it
into
the
fat
paw
of
robin
turgis
but
robin
lingered
and
louis
looking
at
him
in
surprise
met
the
admonishing
glare
of
tristan
give
him
a
penny
for
himself
tristan
whispered
and
the
king
with
an
unwillingness
he
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
added
the
demanded
to
the
other
coins
and
eyed
the
departing
back
of
the
landlord
with
aversion
you
are
generous
with
other
people
pennies
friend
he
snapped
at
his
companion
but
tristan
paying
no
heed
to
his
querulousness
filled
the
two
cups
with
the
clear
golden
liquid
and
thrust
one
of
them
under
the
nose
of
the
sulky
monarch
its
fine
dry
fragrance
soothed
louis
he
took
a
deep
sip
and
was
mollified
another
and
he
had
forgiven
if
not
forgotten
his
generosity
he
winked
at
tristan
amiably
over
the
rim
of
the
goblet
this
is
seeing
life
friend
tristan
he
murmured
contentedly
stretching
his
thin
legs
in
delicious
ease
but
tristan
was
in
no
holiday
humour
let
hope
it
may
be
seeing
death
friend
louis
he
snorted
there
are
a
couple
of
rogues
in
that
covey
who
would
spit
you
or
split
you
or
slit
you
for
the
price
of
a
drink
louis
laughed
affably
and
no
such
cheap
bargain
he
commented
seeing
what
wine
costs
here
but
this
is
an
interesting
business
tristan
would
concede
nothing
to
the
king
the
interest
he
asked
a
few
bullies
bawds
and
bonarobas
boozing
together
you
can
keep
the
same
company
at
court
only
a
shade
cleaner
and
not
be
out
of
pocket
for
the
privilege
either
the
king
mouth
puckered
in
appreciation
of
some
memory
he
leaned
forward
and
touched
tristan
sleeve
gossip
tristan
there
is
at
my
court
a
scholar
who
told
me
an
eastern
tale
pray
god
it
be
a
gay
one
such
as
your
majesty
loves
hush
man
no
here
is
of
an
eastern
king
one
haroun
surnamed
as
i
shall
be
surnamed
the
just
tristan
grunted
sceptically
but
louis
ignoring
the
ejaculation
went
on
it
was
his
pastime
to
go
about
bagdad
of
nights
in
disguise
and
mingling
with
his
people
learn
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
realm
i
am
following
his
example
and
i
expect
to
learn
much
in
my
turn
tristan
looked
pityingly
at
the
complacent
king
you
are
likely
to
learn
how
unpopular
you
are
which
i
could
have
told
you
without
this
trouble
and
you
will
be
lucky
if
you
do
not
get
your
throat
cut
into
the
bargain
something
almost
like
a
smile
disturbed
the
familiar
composure
of
the
king
wrinkles
he
took
another
sip
of
the
wine
and
his
affability
expanded
you
are
always
a
bird
of
evil
omen
he
chirped
be
bright
man
look
at
me
the
burgundian
leaguer
is
at
my
gates
my
throne
sways
like
a
yet
i
do
pull
a
sad
face
it
a
good
thing
that
somebody
is
pleased
tristan
commented
yes
said
louis
opening
out
his
thin
hands
and
studying
their
palms
attentively
i
am
pleased
tristan
interrupted
him
roughly
pleased
that
the
burgundians
threaten
you
outside
the
walls
of
paris
pleased
that
thibaut
bullies
you
inside
the
walls
of
paris
pleased
that
your
soldiers
are
mutinous
pleased
that
your
citizens
are
sullen
by
my
faith
here
are
four
royal
reasons
for
a
royal
pleasure
louis
shook
his
head
playfully
at
his
servant
grumbling
gossip
tristan
he
asked
do
you
know
why
i
have
come
to
this
hovel
i
do
not
walk
abroad
like
a
in
mere
idleness
of
mind
i
have
come
to
learn
what
company
my
lord
the
grand
constable
keeps
tristan
shaggy
eyebrows
arched
in
surprise
as
the
king
continued
our
good
olivier
assures
us
that
our
dear
thibaut
has
taken
it
into
his
head
of
late
to
walk
the
streets
by
night
and
to
haunt
strange
taverns
such
as
this
same
fircone
i
am
plagued
with
a
womanish
curiosity
tristan
and
i
thought
i
would
peep
over
messire
thibaut
shoulder
and
have
an
eye
on
his
cards
tristan
chuckled
the
grand
constable
bears
you
a
grudge
since
you
chose
to
turn
a
kind
eye
on
the
girl
of
vaucelles
she
was
a
wise
virgin
to
dislike
thibaut
mused
the
king
was
she
a
foolish
virgin
to
mistrust
your
majesty
questioned
tristan
louis
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
is
a
proud
piece
gossip
when
i
told
her
that
she
took
my
fancy
she
flamed
into
a
red
rage
that
chastened
me
but
if
she
not
for
me
she
not
for
thibaut
either
the
grand
constable
is
a
bad
enemy
tristan
commented
the
king
replied
at
random
tristan
i
had
a
strange
dream
last
night
i
dreamed
that
i
was
a
swine
rooting
in
the
streets
of
paris
and
that
i
found
a
pearl
of
great
price
in
the
kennel
i
picked
it
up
and
set
it
in
my
crown
a
crowned
pig
tristan
interrupted
is
like
a
tavern
sign
louis
did
not
seem
to
resent
the
interruption
my
good
gossip
in
a
dream
nothing
seems
strange
well
as
i
said
i
set
this
pearl
in
my
crown
and
the
light
of
it
seemed
to
fill
all
my
good
city
of
paris
with
glory
so
that
i
could
see
every
street
and
alley
every
tower
and
pinnacle
more
clearly
than
in
a
noon
and
then
memought
that
the
pearl
weighed
so
heavy
upon
my
forehead
that
i
plucked
it
from
its
place
and
cast
it
to
the
ground
and
would
have
trodden
it
under
foot
when
a
star
shot
swiftly
from
heaven
and
stayed
me
the
king
looked
eagerly
at
his
companion
who
seemed
wholly
uninterested
in
the
narrative
of
the
royal
vision
dreams
and
stars
stars
and
dreams
he
sneered
leave
dreams
to
weaklings
sire
louis
frowned
do
sneer
gossip
but
instruct
who
are
these
people
and
the
sharp
lean
face
of
the
king
thrust
itself
forward
a
little
from
the
nest
of
its
hood
in
the
direction
of
the
gamblers
his
companion
shrugged
his
shoulders
some
of
the
worst
cats
and
rats
in
all
paris
he
answered
the
men
belong
to
a
fellowship
that
is
called
the
company
of
the
cockleshells
and
babble
a
cant
of
their
own
that
baffles
the
if
your
majesty
but
here
a
warning
kick
from
louis
made
him
wince
and
change
his
if
you
wished
to
savour
rascality
these
are
your
blades

pursed
his
thin
lips
in
austere
censure
they
shall
be
reproved
hereafter
he
said
who
are
the
men
worthy
adams
of
such
pestilent
eves
tristan
answered
that
slender
fellow
in
the
purple
jerkin
is

of
gentle
birth
and
a
great
breaker

to

to
say
the
decalogue
backward
you
have
a
pithy
humour
gossip
and
louis
grinned
our
gallows
shall
be
busy
anon
tristan
was
abcut
to
open
his
mouth
in
approval
of
a
sentiment
so
pleasing
to
his
ears
when
his
words
and
his
purpose
were
alike
arrested
by
a
sound
of
a
voice
singing
outside
the
tavern
door
the
voice
was
a
man
voice
something
rough
and
strained
for
fine
music
and
yet
with
a
kind
of
full
and
florid
sweetness
that
carried
the
words
clearly
through
the
windows
they
seemed
to
make
a
complaint
of
fortune
since
i
have
left
the
prison
gate
where
i
came
near
to
say
to
this
poor
life
that
needs
must
fly
from
the
malignity
of
fate
perchance
she
now
will
pass
me
by
since
i
have
left
the
prison
gate
if
the
king
pricked
his
ear
to
listen
and
even
tristan
moved
a
little
in
his
lethargy
the
effect
of
the
song
upon
the
company
of
gamblers
was
instant
and
pronounced
the
abbess
leaped
to
her
feet
crying
out
it
is
the
voice
of

it
is
indeed
his

unutterable
pipe

robin

in

comical
despair
as

out
of

all
the
men
and

were
looking
eagerly
at
the
door
who
is

asked

of

coming

to
flutter

the

chapter
ii
master
françois
villon
as
tristan
spoke
the
tavern
latch
rattled
the
tavern
door
was
flung
noisily
open
and
the
king
gaze
rested
on
a
strange
figure
framed
in
the
entry
the
man
was
of
middle
height
spare
and
slight
and
lean
his
thin
eager
face
was
bronzed
with
the
suns
and
winds
of
a
generation
and
lined
with
the
stern
ciphers
of
malign
experiences
his
dark
straight
hair
was
long
and
unkempt
the
finer
lines
of
his
cheeks
and
chin
were
blurred
with
the
uncropped
growth
of
a
beard
his
eyes
were
bright
and
quick
his
glance
restless
and
comprehensive
a
cunning
reader
of
features
would
have
found
a
home
for
high
thoughts
behind
the
fine
forehead
the
lines
of
infinite
tenderness
upon
the
mobile
lips
the
light
of
some
noble
conflagration
in
the
wild
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
faded
finery
of
many
colours
so
ragged
and
patched
and
hostile
that
he
had
very
much
the
air
of
a
gaudy
scarecrow
his
ruined
cloak
was
tilted
by
a
long
sword
his
disordered
thatch
was
crowned
by
a
battered
cap
grotesquely
adorned
with
a
cock
feather
in
his
leathern
belt
a
small
vellum
bound
book
of
verses
kept
company
with
a
dagger
for
all
his
whimsical
appearance
the
king
keen
eyes
could
note
a
something
gallant
in
the
carriage
of
the
scamp
could
spy
out
qualities
of
manhood
beneath
the
battered
bravery
he
poised
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
in
a
fantastic
attitude
of
salutation
ere
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
strode
forward
to
meet
his
friends
well
hearts
of
gold
how
are
ye
he
cried
joyously
as
he
advanced
with
head
thrown
back
and
open
hands
extended
did
ye
miss
me
lads
did
ye
miss
me
lasses
abbess
huguette
was
at
his
side
in
an
instant
with
her
arms
about
his
neck
fondling
him
and
fawning
upon
him
surely
i
missed
you
she
whispered
where
have
you
been
little
monkey
master
françois
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
curious
pity
then
gently
extricating
himself
from
her
embrace
he
called
out
give
me
a
wash
of
wine
for
my
throat
parched
with
piping
every
man
thrust
his
own
mug
towards
master
françois
beseeching
him
to
drink
of
it
but
he
waved
them
all
aside
imperially
nay
i
will
have
my
own
he
said
have
we
no
landlord
here
master
robin
come
hither
robin
turgis
who
had
kept
apart
up
to
now
surveying
the
with
no
excess
of
favour
moved
slowly
forward
with
his
thumbs
in
his
girdle
and
a
sour
smile
on
his
fat
cheeks
master
françois
addressed
him
sternly
twitching
as
he
did
so
the
landlord
greasy
cap
from
his
pate
and
sending
it
flying
down
the
room
why
do
you
not
salute
gentry
when
they
honour
your
a
mug
of
your
best
beaune
master
to
drink
damnation
to
the
burgundians
robin
turgis
made
no
motion
to
obey
but
his
small
eyes
seemed
to
grow
smaller
as
they
stared
what
colour
has
money
master
françois
he
asked
doggedly
in
a
moment
the
brown
dirty
hand
of
the
poet
was
clapped
to
his
dagger
and
there
was
something
of
a
wolfish
snarl
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
menacingly
the
colour
of
blood
sometimes
but
the
landlord
unabashed
and
undismayed
stood
his
ground
none
of
your
swaggering
master
françois
he
said
sturdily
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
king
in
france
and
that
king
name
is
writ
fair
on
his
coinage
show
me
a
louis
xi
and
i
will
show
you
my
beaune
wine
the
face
of
master
françois
flushed
under
its
grime
and
he
fiddled
at
his
dagger
nervously
as
one
uncertain
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
at
the
dilemma
which
confronted
him
huguette
and
montigny
alike
had
dipped
their
hands
into
their
pouches
for
money
to
pay
the
score
when
to
the
amazement
of
tristan
the
king
forestalled
their
kindnesses
rising
to
his
feet
with
creditable
alacrity
he
advanced
towards
master
françois
and
saluted
him
with
a
gracious
wave
of
the
hand
will
you
let
me
be
of
some
small
service
to
you
he
began
politely
and
as
villon
turned
to
stare
at
him
in
surprise
he
continued
will
you
honour
me
by
drinking
that
beaune
wine
our
host
brags
of
at
my
expense
villon
astonishment
had
not
unnerved
his
clutch
at
opportunity
here
was
a
god
out
of
a
machine
proffering
cool
liquor
to
dry
gullets
master
françois
gave
back
the
salutation
with
a
mien
of
splendid
condescension
while
the
rest
of
the
company
glared
at
the
burgess
who
thus
thrust
himself
upon
them
and
tristan
cursing
the
king
for
his
temerity
felt
for
a
hidden
dagger
villon
patronizing
wave
of
the
hand
was
magnificent
in
its
effrontery
and
his
words
matched
his
gesture
nobly
you
are
a
civil
stranger
and
i
will
so
far
honour
you
louis
bowed
i
left
my
purse
under
my
pillow
this
morning
a
roar
of
laughter
saluted
the
ancient
jape
and
this
ungentle
fellow
denies
me
credit
how
rarely
we
meet
with
an
who
is
also
a
gentleman
with
an
unmoved
countenance
louis
listened
to
villon
words
yet
the
sale
of
a
thing
so
noble
ought
to
beget
a
kind
of
nobility
in
the
vendor
he
said
with
great
gravity
then
turning
to
robin
turgis
whose
mouth
was
gaping
at
this
colloquy
he
bade
him
bring
a
flagon
of
his
best
and
as
he
did
so
he
tendered
him
a
silver
coin
for
which
robin
extended
his
fat
fingers
and
extended
them
too
late
for
at
the
sight
of
the
silver
the
eyes
of
master
françois
had
glistened
and
his
lean
brown
hand
swift
and
agile
as
a
hawk
had
swooped
between
the
king
and
the
publican
and
had
secured
the
coin
which
he
promptly
held
up
and
surveyed
in
an
apparent
ecstasy
of
admiration
is
this
the
good
king
counter
he
asked
and
as
he
did
so
he
plucked
off
his
shabby
bonnet
and
paid
the
exalted
coin
a
profound
obeisance
well
god
bless
his
majesty
say
i
for
i
owe
him
my
present
liberty
there
was
a
when
he
came
to
paris
and
as
i
happened
to
be
in
gaol
at
the
time
through
an
error
of
the
law
here
he
paused
to
leer
knowingly
at
his
comrades
who
yelled
commendation
they
were
good
enough
to
kick
me
into
the
free
air
will
you
add
to
your
kindness
old
gentleman
and
here
master
françois
spun
round
and
solemnly
saluted
his
unknown
entertainer
by
allowing
me
to
guard
and
cherish
this
token
of
our
dear
monarch
in
memory
of
this
notable
event
louis
fortitude
could
not
prevent
him
from
making
something
of
a
wry
face
as
he
hastily
answered
by
all
means
he
beckoned
discreetly
to
robin
turgis
who
making
a
wide
circle
round
master
françois
stole
to
the
king
side
received
from
him
another
coin
and
hastened
away
to
bring
the
drink
it
paid
for
from
his
corner
tristan
surveyed
the
episode
with
a
grim
enjoyment
master
villon
master
villon
he
murmured
to
himself
you
be
sorry
for
this
very
sorry
indeed
and
in
his
mind
eye
he
transferred
the
fantastic
figure
posturing
and
grimacing
before
louis
to
the
end
of
a
long
rope
hanging
from
a
high
gallows
master
françois
ignorant
of
the
immediate
irony
of
existence
wafted
a
kiss
airily
from
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
his
patron
you
are
a
very
obliging
old
gentleman
he
said
approvingly
louis
frowned
slightly
you
harp
on
my
age
sir
he
said
yet
you
are
yourself
no
chicken
this
mild
reproof
seemed
to
irritate
villon
friends
more
than
it
irritated
villon
the
men
manifested
a
marked
inclination
to
hustle
so
questioning
a
citizen
the
women
cackled
at
him
angrily
casin
cholet
bluntly
proposed
to
lend
the
cit
a
slap
on
the
chops
and
huguette
enquired
with
every
emphasis
of
impoliteness
what
his
age
to
you
sobersides
but
villon
quietly
waved
his
turbulent
companions
into
tranquility
patience
damsels
he
said
blandly
patience
good
comrades
of
the
cockleshell
if
our
friend
is
inquisitive
at
least
he
has
paid
his
fee
and
as
he
spoke
he
hid
his
face
for
a
moment
behind
the
huge
mug
of
beaune
wine
which
robin
turgis
at
that
moment
handed
to
him
much
refreshed
by
his
mighty
draught
he
resumed
briskly
for
three
and
thirty
years
i
have
taken
toll
of
life
with
such
result
as
you
see
a
light
pocket
is
a
plague
but
a
light
heart
and
a
light
love
make
amends
for
much
and
as
he
spoke
he
slapped
his
pocket
whose
emptiness
gave
back
no
jingle
drummed
lightly
on
his
bosom
and
nodded
gallantly
to
the
admiring
womenkind
you
are
a
philosopher
said
the
king
you
are
a
little
angel
cried
the
abbess
flinging
her
arms
round
the
poet
in
an
enthusiastic
hug
the
girl
homage
seemed
little
to
villon
taste
for
he
disengaged
himself
swiftly
from
the
embrace
saying
as
he
did
so
gently
abbess
gently
my
shoulders
tingle
and
my
sides
ache
too
sorely
for
claspings
villon
manner
was
so
decisive
and
his
meaning
so
obvious
that
the
curiosity
of
the
gang
burned
keenly
and
found
voice
in
rené
de
montigny
who
asked
what
ailed
him
with
commendable
solicitude
villon
shook
his
head
applied
himself
again
to
the
cannakin
and
emerged
from
it
with
a
most
melancholy
expression
of
countenance
you
behold
in
me
friends
he
sighed
a
victim
of
love
and
his
visage
showed
so
lugubrious
that
it
sorely
tempted
louis
to
laugh
and
hotly
moved
huguette
to
anger
for
she
raged
up
to
villon
challenging
the
meaning
of
his
speech
villon
gently
cooled
her
impatience
hush
hush
my
girl
there
are
many
kinds
of
love
as
you
ought
to
know
well
enough
i
am
a
rogue
and
a
vagabond
no
less
and
so
sometimes
i
love
you
and
other
such
athanasian
wenches
isabeau
there
and
jehanneton
at
this
mention
of
her
novices
names
the
abbess
turned
on
the
two
girls
fiercely
you
minxes
she
cried
do
you
make
eyes
at
my
man
the
pair
shrank
back
from
her
fury
but
master
villon
who
seemed
suddenly
to
have
fallen
into
a
meditative
mood
rambled
on
in
a
kind
of
reverie
as
indifferent
to
the
fircone
and
all
his
surroundings
as
if
he
were
a
lonely
shepherd
tending
his
sheep
on
a
lonely
hillside
but
also
i
am
heaven
forgive
me
a
jingler
of
rhymes
with
the
stars
for
my
candles
and
the
roses
for
my
toys
and
singers
of
songs
sometimes
love
in
another
fashion
and
so
it
has
chanced
to
me
for
my
sins
and
to
my
sorrow
villon
chin
had
dropped
upon
his
breast
the
cock
feather
drooped
dismally
the
singer
seemed
quite
chapfallen
huguette
tired
of
glaring
at
her
offending
minions
again
turned
her
scornful
attention
to
her
dejected
lover
she
sneered
scornfully
pointing
with
derisive
finger
at
master
françois
in
whose
eyes
indeed
the
close
observer
could
discern
the
threatening
of
tears
jehanneton
came
sidling
round
to
villon
piqued
by
natural
curiosity
and
the
desire
to
vex
huguette
tell
us
your
françois
she
pleaded
and
her
pleading
found
an
immediate
supporter
in
louis
the
arabian
nature
of
his
adventure
enchanted
him
and
he
had
a
child
taste
for
a
story
may
i
support
the
lady
prayer
he
said
unless
a
stranger
presence
distresses
you
villon
turned
to
him
with
a
mocking
laugh
lord
love
you
no
he
answered
i
have
long
since
forgotten
reticence
and
will
discourse
of
my
empty
purse
my
empty
belly
and
my
empty
heart
to
any
man
gather
around
me
cullions
and
and
listen
to
the
strange
adventure
of
master
françois
villon
clerk
of
paris
joyous
applause
greeted
his
speech
jehan
le
loup
seizing
upon
an
empty
barrel
that
stood
in
a
corner
trundled
it
forward
and
standing
it
on
one
end
invited
villon
to
take
his
seat
upon
this
whimsical
throne
the
poet
sprang
lightly
upon
the
perch
thus
provided
for
him
and
sat
there
with
his
legs
crossed
holding
his
long
sword
against
his
knees
with
both
hands
the
men
and
women
gathered
about
him
like
bees
about
a
huguette
placed
herself
on
a
stool
at
his
feet
jehanneton
flung
herself
full
length
on
the
ground
and
stared
up
into
his
face
robin
turgis
straddled
a
bench
at
some
distance
and
grinned
louis
seized
the
opportunity
to
whisper
behind
his
hand
to
tristan
that
he
found
the
fellow
diverting
to
which
tristan
replied
gruffly
that
he
for
his
part
found
him
a
dull
ape
louis
might
have
argued
the
point
but
his
interest
was
claimed
by
the
voice
of
villon
who
being
comfortably
installed
on
his
was
beginning
his
promised
narrative
a
philosopher
would
have
discerned
something
pathetic
in
the
picture
of
the
ragged
rascal
thus
girdled
about
with
blackguards
of
a
baser
sort
his
lean
body
quivering
his
eager
face
alive
with
emotions
mockery
on
his
lips
and
sorrow
in
his
eyes
to
the
sardonic
king
it
afforded
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
than
amusement
you
must
know
dear
devils
and
blowens
that
three
days
ago
when
i
was
lying
in
the
kennel
which
is
my
humour
and
staring
at
the
sky
which
is
my
recreation
i
speak
honest
citizen
but
in
parable
or
allegory
a
dear
device
with
the
schoolmen
i
saw
between
me
and
heaven
the
face
of
a
lady
the
loveliest
face
i
ever
saw
here
the
poor
abbess
indignation
overcrowding
her
borrowed
mannishness
began
to
sniffle
and
to
assert
that
the
speaker
was
a
faithless
pig
but
villon
unheeding
her
whimpers
went
on
with
his
tale
she
was
going
to
church
god
shield
her
but
she
looked
my
way
as
she
passed
and
though
she
saw
me
no
more
than
she
saw
the
i
stood
on
i
saw
her
once
and
for
ever
we
babble
a
deal
of
love
but
for
the
most
part
we
know
little
or
nothing
about
it
and
when
it
comes
it
knocks
us
silly
i
was
knocked
so
silly
that
well
what
do
you
think
was
the
silly
thing
i
did
villon
turned
his
alert
face
to
each
member
of
his
audience
and
his
derisive
mouth
belied
the
sadness
of
his
eyes
emptied
a
can
for
oblivion
montigny
suggested
blanche
was
no
less
practical
kissed
a
wench
for
the
same
purpose
she
cried
the
times
that
i
been
wooed
out
of
my
name
picked
the
woman
pocket
casin
cholet
hinted
wagging
his
shock
head
wisely
while
jehan
le
loup
with
a
hideous
leer
sniggered
got
near
her
in
the
crowd
and
pinched
her
and
suited
the
action
to
the
word
with
finger
and
thumb
on
blanche
plump
shoulder
master
françois
dissipated
all
this
roguish
philosophy
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
la
la
la
he
chirruped
sillier
than
all
these
i
followed
her
into
the
church
the
silence
of
astonishment
fell
upon
the
audience
only
colin
de
cayeulx
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
formulate
his
amazement
in
a
prolonged
whistle
louis
crossed
himself
repeatedly
under
his
gown
you
are
not
a
sir
he
questioned
sourly
villon
answered
him
sweetly
no
old
queernabs
unless
there
an
to
open
or
a
matter
of
gold
plate
to
pilfer
guy
tabarie
hurriedly
interrupted
him
with
a
warning
cry
of
cave
and
a
significant
glance
at
the
strangers
but
villon
derided
his
fears
nonsense
he
cried
leaning
forward
and
playfully
slapping
louis
on
the
back
with
his
sword
this
good
cuffin
has
a
friendly
face
and
can
take
a
joke
ca
you
old
rabbit
louis
winced
and
then
grinned
as
tristan
gasped
in
anger
i
thank
heaven
i
have
a
sense
ot
humour
he
said
with
a
sly
glance
at
his
companion
villon
went
on
with
his
story
well
i
sprawled
there
in
the
dark
with
my
knees
on
the
cold
ground
and
all
the
while
the
sound
of
her
beauty
was
sweet
in
my
ears
and
the
taste
of
her
beauty
was
salt
on
my
lips
and
the
pain
of
her
beauty
was
gnawing
at
my
heart
and
i
prayed
that
i
might
see
her
again
at
this
point
huguette
who
had
been
following
the
narrative
with
a
feline
ferocity
caught
up
a
and
made
to
throw
it
at
the
poet
head
but
was
dexterously
disarmed
by
guy
tabarie
before
the
vessel
had
time
to
quit
her
fingers
sulkily
she
plumped
herself
down
on
her
stool
again
while
villon
quite
unconscious
of
the
averted
peril
rambled
on
dreamily
and
the
incense
tickled
my
nostrils
and
the
painted
saints
sneered
at
me
and
bits
of
rhymes
and
bits
of
prayers
jigged
in
my
brain
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
drunk
with
some
new
and
delectable
liquor
and
then
she
slipped
out
and
i
after
her
she
took
the
holy
water
from
my
fingers
villon
voice
sank
reverently
and
huguette
took
advantage
of
the
pause
i
wish
it
had
burned
you
to
the
bone
she
interrupted
spitefully
master
villon
shook
his
head
it
burned
deeper
than
that
believe
me
outside
on
god
steps
stood
a
puppet
who
greeted
her
and
they
ambled
away
together
i
on
their
heels
presently
they
came
to
a
gateway
and
in
slips
my
quarry
and
as
she
did
so
she
turned
to
her
squire
and
i
saw
her
face
again
and
lost
it
for
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
turned
to
louis
i
suppose
you
wonder
why
i
talk
like
this
but
when
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
must
spit
it
out
or
it
chokes
me
i
have
learned
to
wonder
at
nothing
louis
answered
sagely
villon
picked
up
the
dropped
thread
of
his
tale
i
saluted
the
gallant
and
begged
to
know
the
lady
name
he
took
me
for
a
madman
but
he
told
me
in
a
second
huguette
was
on
her
legs
again
and
nestling
her
eager
face
close
to
that
of
villon
as
she
whispered
coaxingly
what
was
the
lady
name
dear
françois
master
françois
looked
into
her
watchful
eyes
with
a
wise
smile
be
secret
sweet
he
murmured
it
was
her
majesty
the
queen
a
wild
roar
of
laughter
from
villon
friends
greeted
this
sally
and
the
fury
it
brought
to
huguette
face
louis
royally
angered
made
as
if
to
rise
in
protest
but
the
heavy
hand
of
tristan
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
restrained
him
and
villon
noticing
his
irritation
waved
him
down
with
a
pacifying
gesture
now
now
my
rum
duke
he
cried
your
loyalty
need
not
take
fire
it
was
not
her
majesty
but
her
name
i
shall
keep
to
myself
though
it
is
written
on
my
shoulders
in
fair
large
blue
and
black
bruises
this
statement
stirred
a
murmur
of
surprise
in
the
gathering
did
the
pink
and
gold
popinjay
beat
you
montigny
asked
interpreting
the
general
curiosity
no
no
villon
answered
it
came
about
thus
we
tinkers
of
verses
set
a
price
on
our
wares
that
few
find
them
worth
yet
with
the
in
my
veins
i
wrote
rhymes
to
this
lady
and
sent
them
to
her
fairly
writ
on
a
piece
of
parchment
that
cost
me
a
dinner
did
you
think
she
would
come
to
your
whistle
like
a
bird
to
a
lure
louis
enquired
playfully
villon
sighed
again
in
this
kind
of
madness
a
minstrel
thinks
himself
a
new
orpheus
who
could
win
a
woman
out
of
hell
with
his
music
but
i
got
my
answer
oh
i
got
my
answer
he
dropped
suddenly
into
a
moody
silence
which
was
not
to
the
taste
of
the
fellowship
who
were
interested
in
the
adventure
montigny
leaning
forward
gave
villon
a
clap
on
the
back
which
made
him
shrink
and
shouted
what
was
the
answer
villon
began
to
laugh
a
loud
mirthless
laugh
that
had
no
human
warmth
in
it
a
fellow
like
a
page
boarded
me
here
three
days
ago
he
asked
me
if
i
had
sent
certain
verses
to
a
certain
quarter
if
so
i
was
to
follow
him
at
once
i
followed
like
a
sheep
with
my
heart
drumming
till
we
came
to
a
quiet
place
and
there
four
boobies
with
cudgels
fell
upon
me
i
was
taken
unawares
i
had
no
weapon
but
my
jackdagger
the
blows
were
raining
upon
me
as
fast
as
acorns
fly
in
a
high
wind
so
i
thought
it
no
shame
to
take
to
my
heels
the
varlets
pursued
me
full
cry
till
i
led
them
to
a
part
of
paris
where
their
lives
would
not
have
been
worth
a
minute
purchase
and
they
had
to
stay
their
chase
but
i
have
been
rarely
drubbed
and
roundly
basted
and
my
poor
back
and
sides
are
most
womanishly
tender
i
go
abroad
no
more
without
excalibur
he
tapped
his
sword
hilt
as
he
spoke
huguette
glared
fiercely
up
at
him
will
it
teach
you
not
to
play
the
fool
again
asked
with
a
vicious
snap
of
her
white
teeth
it
will
teach
me
not
to
play
the
fool
again
villon
answered
sadly
the
mark
of
the
beast
is
upon
me
and
i
shall
dream
no
more
dreams
he
shook
himself
as
if
he
were
trying
to
shake
away
clinging
memories
and
extended
his
empty
can
to
montigny
saying
i
thirsty
again
more
liquor
as
montigny
filled
up
for
his
leader
louis
commented
you
drink
more
than
is
good
for
your
health
sir
villon
rounded
on
him
angrily
with
flushed
face
and
shining
eyes
mind
your
own
business
he
shouted
and
the
rest
shouted
with
him
applaudingly
what
can
a
man
do
but
drink
when
france
is
going
to
the
devil
with
the
burgundians
camped
in
the
free
fields
where
i
played
in
childhood
and
a
nincompoop
sits
on
the
throne
and
lets
them
besiege
his
city
the
rascals
laughed
tristan
whispered
to
himself
you
be
sorry
you
spoke
master
villon
the
king
propounded
a
problem
no
doubt
you
could
do
better
than
the
king
if
you
wore
the
king
shoes
villon
rolled
about
on
his
barrel
in
an
ecstasy
of
entertainment
if
i
could
not
do
better
than
louis
louis
having
his
occasions
and
advantages
may
huguette
there
never
kiss
me
again
his
boon
companions
laughed
huguette
whispered
sulkily
perhaps
she
never
will
isabeau
came
sidling
and
bridling
up
to
louis
wheedling
like
a
cat
as
she
said
our
françois
has
made
a
rhyme
of
it
sir
how
he
would
carry
himself
if
he
wore
the
king
shoes
louis
was
always
ready
for
any
kind
of
gallantry
he
put
his
arms
around
the
girl
slim
body
and
drew
her
on
to
his
knee
has
he
indeed
pretty
minion
he
said
may
we
not
hear
it
master
poet
villon
with
mock
modesty
had
tried
to
restrain
isabeau
from
speaking
of
the
work
but
now
he
changed
his
tune
you
may
you
shall
for
is
a
true
song
though
it
would
cost
me
my
neck
if
it
came
to
the
king
ears
very
likely
but
you
are
not
tall
enough
to
whisper
in
them
so
here
goes
with
a
shout
villon
sprang
to
his
feet
draped
his
tattered
cloak
closely
about
him
struck
a
commanding
attitude
and
began
to
recite
with
great
solemnity
louis
scooped
his
fingers
behind
his
ear
that
he
might
hear
the
better
the
words
that
fell
from
the

all
french
folk
ye
be
who
love
your
country
soil
and
sand
from
paris
to
the
breton
sea
and
back
again
to
norman
strand
forsooth
ye
seem
a
silly
band
sheep
without
shepherd
left
to
chance
far
otherwise
our
fatherland
if
villon
were
the
king
of
france
louis
glanced
grimly
at
tristan
the
rogues
rubbed
their
hands
and
chuckled
villon
smiled
in
pride
and
went
on
the
figure
on
the
throne
you
see
is
nothing
but
a
puppet
planned
to
wear
the
regal
bravery
of
silken
coat
and
gilded
wand
not
so
we
frenchmen
understand
the
lord
of
lion
heart
and
glance
and
such
a
one
would
take
command
if
villon
were
the
king
of
france
the
king
face
was
a
study
in
sardonics
tristan
was
with
rage
the
gang
applauded
and
villon
glowed
with
their
applause
his
counsellors
are
rogues
perdie
while
men
of
honest
mind
are
banned
to
creak
upon
the
gallows
tree
or
squeal
in
prisons
we
want
a
chief
to
bear
the
brand
and
bid
the
damned
burgundians
dance
god
where
the
oriflamme
should
stand
if
villon
were
the
king
of
france
mugs
and
cans
clattered
approval
the
rhymer
eyes
widened
as
he
drew
breath
to
blow
forth
the
envoi
of
his
ballade
louis
the
little
play
the
grand
buffet
the
foe
with
sword
and
lance
is
what
would
happen
by
this
hand
if
villon
were
the
king
of
france
a
roar
of
enthusiasm
came
from
the
full
throats
of
the
band
montigny
slapped
villon
on
the
back
with
a
well
crowed
chanticleer
huguette
flung
her
arms
around
him
and
hugged
him
as
she
cried
passionately
i
forgive
you
much
for
that
light
in
your
eyes
but
the
poet
seemed
weary
after
so
much
heat
he
pushed
the
girl
away
and
drooped
on
his
hogshead
the
rogues
rattled
away
to
their
table
again
and
villon
was
left
alone
with
louis
who
questioned
him
drily
you
call
yourself
a
patriot
i
suppose
villon
had
recovered
sufficient
energy
to
drain
a
mug
of
wine
he
turned
to
the
king
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
by
no
such
title
he
answered
i
am
but
a
poor
devil
with
a
heart
too
big
for
his
body
and
a
hope
too
large
for
his
hoop
had
i
been
begotten
in
a
brocaded
bed
i
might
have
led
armies
and
served
france
have
loved
ladies
without
fear
of
cudgellings
and
told
kings
truths
without
dread
of
the
halter
while
as
it
is
i
consort
with
sharps
and
wantons
and
make
my
complaint
to
a
dull
little
buzzard
like
you
old
noodle
oh
is
a
fool
play
and
it
were
well
to
be
out
of
it
you
wo
have
long
to
worry
tristan
muttered
to
himself
under
his
breath
and
found
great
comfort
in
the
thought
louis
merely
said
you
are
sententious
villon
took
him
up
swiftly
the
quintessence
of
envy
no
less
i
have
great
thoughts
great
desires
great
ambitions
great
appetites
what
you
will
i
might
have
changed
the
world
and
left
a
memory
as
it
is
i
sleep
in
a
garret
under
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
and
shall
be
forgotten
even
by
the
wolves
i
pack
with
but
this
is
dry
thinking
let
to
drinking
as
he
spoke
villon
rose
to
join
his
comrades
when
his
quick
eye
noted
that
robin
turgis
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
bench
villon
skipped
lightly
toward
him
dexterously
unhooked
his
bunch
of
keys
from
his
girdle
and
with
a
triumphant
gesture
made
on
tiptoe
for
the
cellar
door
which
he
unlocked
and
through
which
he
disappeared
louis
looked
after
him
with
an
acid
smile
tristan
leaned
forward
and
plucked
at
the
kind
sleeve
shall
i
hang
him
he
asked
hoarsely
the
king
turned
musing
to
his
henchman
we
shall
see
he
is
a
fellow
but
he
might
have
been
a
man
he
has
set
me
thinking
of
my
dream
i
was
a
swine
rioting
in
the
streets
of
paris
and
i
found
a
well
let
us
kill
the
time
with
cards
till
thibaut
comes
tristan
produced
a
pack
of
cards
from
his
pouch
and
laid
them
on
the
table
do
you
think
he
will
come
he
asked
he
does
not
expect
to
find
me
here
i
promise
you
louis
answered
he
would
not
come
if
he
did
barber
olivier
is
to
warn
me
of
his
coming
as
he
spoke
the
opened
a
little
and
the
king
hearing
the
click
of
the
catch
asked
is
that
he
tristan
glanced
round
over
his
shoulder
the
door
was
pushed
partly
open
and
an
old
stooped
woman
was
peeping
curiously
into
the
room
tristan
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
sire
he
snarled
another
old
woman
by
this
time
the
king
had
arranged
the
cards
to
his
satisfaction
he
made
an
imperative
gesture
to
his
companion
to
seat
himself
and
in
a
few
seconds
had
forgotten
everything
else
in
the
excitement
of
the
game
meanwhile
the
old
woman
having
pushed
the
door
wide
open
came
softly
into
the
room
she
was
a
quiet
creature
one
of
those
human
shadows
who
suggest
without
tragedy
faded
youth
and
withered
comeliness
she
was
very
poorly
but
very
neatly
dressed
in
worn
grey
and
rusty
black
and
the
linen
folds
about
her
lined
face
were
scrupulously
clean
she
looked
anxiously
around
her
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
in
the
dim
light
of
the
tavern
unable
to
discern
much
but
evidently
eager
to
discern
something
rené
de
montigny
tired
of
teasing
isabeau
suddenly
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
the
old
woman
as
she
stood
very
helpless
and
wistful
peering
about
her
an
impish
spirit
floated
on
the
surface
of
his
mind
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
danced
towards
her
in
a
fantastic
manner
sweeping
her
a
profound
salutation
as
he
approached
her
your
pleasure
sweet
princess
he
said
with
mock
deference
the
old
woman
turned
her
wrinkled
visage
up
to
his
in
wonder
is
master
françois
villon
in
this
company
sir
she
faltered
montigny
treated
her
to
another
profound
bow
sweet
creature
he
simpered
i
kiss
your
hand
and
inquire
he
turned
to
his
companions
at
the
table
and
his
eye
rested
mockingly
on
the
bowed
figure
of
huguette
after
master
villon
had
told
his
tale
huguette
had
been
glum
enough
and
her
comrades
finding
her
snappish
wisely
left
her
to
herself
she
had
pulled
a
pack
of
cards
from
her
scarlet
pouch
she
had
been
spelling
out
her
fortune
silently
and
the
death
card
insisted
itself
again
and
again
with
grim
pertinacity
with
a
sense
of
despair
that
was
strange
to
her
airy
nature
she
had
bowed
her
face
on
her
arms
and
was
sobbing
softly
to
herself
montigny
was
not
a
man
to
be
touched
by
a
sorrow
he
mockingly
gesticulated
over
her
bent
shoulders
as
he
cried
to
the
others
in
a
false
whisper
there
is
a
beautiful
woman
at
the
door
beseeching
our
françois
the
moment
these
words
fell
on
huguette
ears
they
stung
her
into
life
and
activity
she
leaped
to
her
feet
in
a
flash
what
do
you
say
she
raged
and
then
seeing
a
woman
form
a
few
feet
away
from
her
she
rushed
towards
the
stranger
furiously
while
the
others
rose
in
cages
expectation
of
some
new
excitement
what
do
you
seek
here
she
asked
fiercely
of
the
old
woman
and
then
as
she
saw
the
pitiful
wrinkled
face
staring
up
at
her
she
started
back
in
surprise
the
old
woman
misinterpreting
the
sex
of
her
questioner
from
the
dress
that
huguette
wore
began
apologetically
asking
your
pardon
young
gentleman
and
for
a
moment
her
words
were
drowned
in
a
shout
of
delighted
laughter
as
the
listening
rogues
appreciated
the
blunder
she
had
made
asking
your
pardon
young
gentleman
i
seek
master
françois
villon
huguette
snapped
at
her
impatiently
seek
him
and
find
him
then
turning
to
rené
she
cried
montigny
you
beast
and
with
her
hand
on
her
dagger
made
hotly
for
him
montigny
grinning
like
a
delighted
monkey
skipped
for
safety
dodging
her
around
the
table
while
the
others
perceiving
a
victim
in
the
bewildered
old
woman
joined
hands
in
a
ring
and
began
dancing
wildly
around
her
singing
a
ribald
song
the
old
woman
as
frightened
and
timid
as
a
mouse
might
be
if
it
suddenly
found
itself
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
dancing
cats
stood
still
at
this
moment
the
cellar
door
opened
and
françois
reappeared
carrying
in
his
arms
a
large
jug
of
wine
perceiving
that
the
landlord
still
lay
in
his
heavy
sleep
he
smiled
delightedly
to
himself
closed
the
cellar
door
softly
and
placed
his
booty
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
nearest
to
the
settle
the
noise
of
the
tumult
attracted
him
from
his
successful
plunder
and
looking
up
he
became
aware
of
what
was
happening
in
a
second
his
contented
mien
changed
and
dashing
into
the
dancing
crowd
he
struck
jehan
le
loup
a
heavy
blow
with
the
bunch
of
keys
which
felled
him
to
the
ground
like
a
log
in
a
moment
the
cluster
of
rascals
dissipated
and
villon
caught
the
old
woman
in
his
arms
damn
you
chubs
he
shouted
at
them
it
my
mother
then
as
he
drew
the
trembling
old
woman
towards
the
fireplace
he
whispered
in
her
ears
do
be
frightened
mammy
they
meant
no
harm
a
certain
air
of
contrition
was
on
the
faces
of
most
of
the
members
of
the
gang
as
they
stood
apart
and
eyed
the
mother
and
son
guy
tabarie
who
had
a
wholesome
dislike
to
quarrels
slipped
quietly
into
the
cool
street
to
seek
pleasure
in
some
place
where
the
atmosphere
might
be
less
stormy
robin
turgis
wakened
from
his
heavy
sleep
clapped
his
hand
instinctively
to
his
girdle
and
found
that
his
keys
were
missing
my
keys
my
keys
he
shouted
where
are
my
keys
and
then
catching
sight
of
them
where
they
lay
by
the
prostrate
form
of
jehan
le
loup
he
rushed
forward
and
secured
them
greedily
by
this
time
jehan
le
loup
had
recovered
the
senses
which
swinging
blow
had
knocked
out
of
him
and
was
crawling
slowly
into
a
sitting
posture
he
glared
ferociously
at
master
françois
and
his
evil
right
hand
stole
to
the
pommel
of
his
dagger
you
have
cracked
my
crown
curse
you
he
grunted
and
then
swiftly
sprang
to
his
feet
with
the
bare
blade
in
his
hand
and
rushed
at
his
assailant
but
villon
was
too
alert
to
be
taken
unawares
he
had
not
time
to
draw
his
sword
but
in
a
second
he
had
snatched
a
spit
from
the
fire
and
extending
it
scientifically
kept
jehan
le
loup
at
length
huguette
seized
jehan
by
the
dagger
arm
she
is
his
mother
she
said
angrily
you
all
had
mothers
i
suppose
let
him
alone
jehan
le
loup
unwillingly
sheathed
his
weapon
huguette
dragged
him
back
to
the
table
villon
replaced
the
spit
which
had
somewhat
burned
his
fingers
and
sat
down
by
his
mother
side
on
the
settle
in
peace
did
they
frighten
you
mammy
he
whispered
but
they
meant
no
harm
boys
and
girls
girls
and
boys
the
old
woman
put
her
arms
tightly
about
him
villon
grimaced
her
loving
touch
was
as
painful
as
a
hostile
one
to
his
bruised
body
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
repress
her
embrace
come
home
françois
she
said
come
home
where
have
you
been
these
three
days
villon
caressed
the
old
woman
very
tenderly
as
he
answered
very
busy
mammy
state
secrets
mum
the
word
how
did
you
find
me
out
they
told
me
at
the
unicorn
the
old
woman
said
that
i
might
find
you
here
villon
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
oh
the
unicorn
is
no
longer
fashionable
they
want
payment
on
the
nail
there
confound
them
besides
this
is
nearer
the
walls
and
we
can
hear
the
burgundians
shouting
it
is
as
good
as
a
relish
with
our
wine
mother
villon
shook
her
grey
head
sadly
come
away
she
entreated
you
have
had
wine
enough
villon
contradicted
her
instantly
never
in
my
life
mammy
i
have
a
fool
head
and
always
get
into
my
altitudes
too
soon
then
seeing
the
look
of
disappointment
that
made
her
grey
old
face
look
greyer
still
he
added
i
can
not
come
home
just
now
mammy
but
there
is
something
i
can
do
for
you
do
you
remember
when
i
was
a
little
child
something
in
the
words
made
him
stop
suddenly
the
hideous
contrast
between
the
phrase
and
the
place
wherein
he
was
between
the
mother
who
fondled
him
and
the
wild
and
who
were
his
daily
friends
and
who
were
drinking
and
dicing
behind
him
at
the
other
side
of
the
settle
came
upon
him
like
a
great
wave
of
pain
and
knocked
the
mirth
out
of
him
he
turned
away
from
his
mother
and
repeated
to
himself
dismally
god
when
i
was
a
little
child
the
mother
pity
the
mother
protection
immediately
asserted
themselves
you
were
the
prettiest
child
woman
ever
bore
she
said
softly
villon
turned
towards
her
again
while
he
tried
to
wink
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
you
used
to
sing
me
to
sleep
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
he
rocked
her
slowly
backward
and
forward
in
his
arms
while
he
crooned
the
words
of
that
old
nurse
song
which
has
soothed
so
many
generations
of
french
children
to
sleep
do
do
do
dormira
tantot
well
mammy
your
dutiful
son
has
made
a
song
for
you
to
sing
yourself
to
sleep
with
i
went
to
church
the
other
day
oh
on
my
honour
i
did
this
was
in
reply
to
a
startled
look
of
surprise
that
flooded
the
old
woman
face
and
a
prayer
came
into
my
head
a
prayer
for
you
to
say
to
our
lady
the
old
woman
kissed
him
fondly
on
the
forehead
my
love
bird
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
a
boyish
look
that
had
long
been
absent
from
villon
face
came
back
to
it
for
a
moment
here
it
is
he
said
listen
and
he
whispered
to
her
the
verses
he
had
made
while
the
old
woman
crossed
herself
reverentially
lady
of
heaven
queen
of
earth
empress
of
hell
i
kneel
and
plead
you
pity
by
the
holy
birth
the
humblest
christian
of
the
creed
i
can
not
write
i
can
not
read
i
am
a
woman
poor
and
old
but
in
the
church
where
i
behold
the
gates
of
paradise
i
cry
woman
to
woman
make
me
bold
in
thy
belief
to
live
and
die
there
mammy
there
is
a
pretty
prayer
for
you
mother
villon
was
dissolved
in
tears
and
sobbed
on
his
shoulder
you
should
have
been
a
good
man
she
said
villon
stroked
her
hair
very
gently
we
are
as
heaven
pleases
dear
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
remembering
the
silver
coin
which
he
had
confiscated
from
the
king
he
dipped
his
fingers
into
his
pouch
and
produced
it
here
is
something
for
you
mammy
he
said
and
as
the
old
woman
with
a
faint
flush
on
her
worn
cheeks
seemed
about
to
protest
he
insisted
oh
yes
take
it
take
it
it
was
honestly
come
by
and
you
will
spend
it
more
honestly
than
i
should
he
forced
the
coin
into
her
lean
brown
hand
and
added
now
run
away
mammy
and
pray
yourself
to
sleep
you
shall
see
me
soon
i
promise
you
he
led
her
gently
across
the
tavern
floor
to
the
door
which
he
opened
for
her
as
she
turned
to
go
she
looked
up
to
him
and
repeated
two
lines
of
his
prayer
woman
to
woman
make
me
bold
in
thy
belief
to
live
and
die
as
the
door
closed
and
villon
turned
to
come
back
to
his
seat
jehan
le
loup
who
had
been
eyeing
him
and
who
was
eager
to
pay
off
the
score
of
his
cracked
crown
rose
to
his
feet
dragging
isabeau
with
him
and
barred
his
passage
kiss
a
young
mouth
for
a
change
he
said
and
thrust
the
girl
against
the
poet
villon
brushed
them
both
aside
go
to
the
devil
he
said
angrily
and
passed
them
once
again
jehan
hand
sought
his
weapon
and
once
again
he
was
restrained
he
is
in
one
of
his
bad
moods
said
isabeau
leave
him
to
himself
and
she
drew
her
reluctant
companion
back
to
the
table
while
villon
seated
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
settle
staring
into
the
fire
at
the
moment
the
tavern
door
was
thrust
open
violently
and
guy
tabarie
rushed
into
the
room
his
great
moon
face
sweating
his
eyes
bulging
his
fringe
of
crimson
locks
flaming
out
from
the
eggshell
dome
of
his
bald
head
his
mighty
belly
swaying
with
a
passion
of
excitement
friends
he
shrieked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
there
a
fight
at
fat
margot
between
two
wenches
they
are
stripped
to
the
waist
and
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
come
and
see
for
the
love
of
god
the
whole
band
was
afoot
in
an
instant
clamantly
agog
guy
tabarie
turned
as
he
finished
speaking
and
rushed
through
the
open
door
into
the
shining
moonlit
street
the
rest
trailed
after
him
wandering
stars
in
the
tail
of
a
dishonourable
comet
shouting
screaming
laughing
pushing
panting
eager
for
the
promised
sport
i
crown
the
victor
cried
montigny
as
he
ran
and
i
console
the
vanquished
shouted
jehan
le
loup
as
he
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
road
and
vanished
clattering
into
the
night
only
huguette
remained
of
all
the
fellowship
and
she
turned
instinctively
to
villon
when
he
crouched
over
the
dying
fire
will
you
come
françois
she
whispered
softly
villon
lifted
his
head
for
a
moment
from
his
hands
to
signify
a
refusal
nay
i
am
reading
huguette
blazed
out
at
him
a
fierce
you
lie
which
failed
to
move
the
poet
from
his
melancholy
resolve
a
man
may
read
without
book
he
said
go
your
ways
girl
and
skelp
both
the
hussies
he
drooped
into
a
dejected
heap
again
oblivious
of
the
girl
who
looked
at
him
half
sadly
half
angrily
for
an
instant
and
then
disappeared
in
her
turn
into
the
causeway
calling
upon
her
knavish
heralds
to
wait
for
her
robin
turgis
shutting
the
door
after
her
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
retired
to
his
own
quarters
to
seek
sleep
until
custom
should
return
louie
and
tristan
deep
in
their
cards
paid
little
heed
to
anything
else
your

tristan
said
after
a
panse
the
game
makes
amends
louis
answered
you
are
winning
sire
tristan
grunted
the
king
chirruped
merrily
my
grandsire
will
be
remembered
longer
than
most
kings
for
the
sake
of
these
wasters
and
winners
that
they
made
to
soothe
his
madness
but
even
as
he
spoke
his
mirth
faded
for
a
turn
of
fortune
gave
tristan
an
opportunity
my
game
sire
he
said
and
swept
the
stakes
into
his
pocket
the
king
fell
into
a
frowning
silence
as
tristan
dealt
the
cards
again
and
scrutinized
his
new
hand
with
a
sombre
care
as
if
the
fate
of
empire
depended
upon
it
scarcely
a
sound
disturbed
the
heavy
quiet
of
the
room
master
françois
villon
glooming
in
his
settle
corner
sucked
a
long
noiseless
draught
from
his
stolen
jug
and
meditated
drearily
between
wine
and
weariness
his
head
was
beginning
to
swim
his
head
felt
as
heavy
as
lead
and
his
brain
as
light
and
foolish
as
a
feather
two
women
faces
danced
before
his
eyes
one
proud
and
beautiful
and
young
the
other
humble
and
pitiful
and
old
and
he
tried
his
best
to
shut
both
of
them
out
of
his
senses
vaguely
he
tried
to
shape
a
ballade
a
noble
ballade
in
honour
of
all
things
good
to
eat
he
had
got
at
least
an
excellent
overword
a
dish
of
tripe
the
best
of
all
he
mouthed
the
line
with
a
relish
but
his
eyes
were
seeing
straws
and
his
stubbled
chin
scraped
his
breast
there
came
a
click
at
the
latch
but
he
did
not
heed
it
he
would
scarcely
have
heeded
a
burgundian
cannon
shot
he
had
drifted
into
a
lumpish
doze
and
yet
the
way
of
the
world
depended
for
him
upon
that
lift
of
a
latch
chapter
iii
the
coming
of
katherine
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
entered
the
room
a
woman
closely
muffled
after
the
fashion
adopted
by
discreet
ladies
when
they
walked
abroad
in
paris
in
the
fifteenth
century
she
was
followed
by
an
armed
to
whom
she
turned
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
as
she
paused
upon
the
threshold
you
are
sure
this
is
the
place
she
asked
and
the
man
answered
sure
wait
outside
the
muffled
lady
commanded
and
the
servant
with
an
obeisance
stepped
back
into
the
street
the
woman
looked
cautiously
about
her
only
her
bright
eye
showing
over
the
lifted
fold
of
her
cloak
villon
was
hidden
from
her
while
he
sat
there
was
no
one
in
her
view
save
the
two
men
playing
cards
she
came
cautiously
forward
and
touched
tristan
who
was
nearest
to
her
on
the
shoulder
he
swung
round
with
hooded
face
to
answer
the
challenge
and
as
he
did
so
louis
took
advantage
of
his
turned
back
to
examine
hand
which
he
had
laid
upon
the
table
and
to
substitute
a
card
from
his
own
hand
for
one
of
his
adversary
has
master
françois
villon
been
here
the
woman
asked
her
voice
was
full
and
sweet
and
tristan
knew
it
well
though
he
listened
unmovably
she
had
lowered
her
cloak
enough
to
allow
him
a
glimpse
of
a
young
lovely
face
but
he
needed
no
glimpse
to
assure
him
yonder
he
squats
by
the
hearth
he
answered
masking
his
own
voice
with
hoarseness
and
jerking
his
thumb
towards
the
settle
the
eyes
followed
the
signal
and
saw
for
the
first
time
the
huddled
figure
on
the
bench
i
thank
you
she
said
simply
and
moved
away
into
the
background
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
crouching
form
her
fingers
clasped
nervously
waiting
an
impatient
patience
upon
resolution
tristan
leaned
hurriedly
over
to
the
king
zounds
sire
do
you
know
who
that
was
louis
smiling
at
his
adopted
cards
answered
carelessly
some
bonaroba
who
took
you
for
a
gull
but
tristan
nest
words
pricked
him
from
his
indifference
it
was
your
majesty
kinswoman
the
lady
katherine
de
vaucelles
the
king
rose
cautiously
to
his
feet
oh
ho
oh
ho
he
chuckled
does
lovely
katherine
come
to
meet
thibaut
she
seeks
françois
villon
sire
the
king
started
is
she
the
girl
he
spoke
of
do
we
catch
her
tripping
louis
looked
at
the
motionless
figure
of
the
girl
then
his
gaze
travelled
rapidly
around
the
room
behind
him
was
a
doorway
soundlessly
he
opened
it
saw
that
it
gave
on
to
a
dark
passage
motioned
tristan
through
it
bade
him
in
a
whisper
to
wait
in
the
darkness
as
tristan
disappeared
the
girl
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
and
moved
slowly
across
the
floor
toward
the
dozing
poet
the
king
watched
her
narrowly
as
he
too
began
to
move
skulking
among
the
shadows
along
the
wall
his
goal
was
the
distant
space
behind
the
settle
where
his
cunning
mind
discerned
a
good
listening
place
for
to
listen
was
louis
passion
the
king
cread
was
the
king
breath
was
for
a
moment
he
paused
at
the
as
if
about
to
pass
out
but
seeing
that
he
was
unnoticed
he
drifted
unheeded
through
obscurity
to
his
haven
and
nestled
there
just
as
the
girl
bending
forward
touched
the
sleeper
firmly
on
the
shoulders
and
then
drew
back
defiantly
abiding
by
her
temerity
villon
moved
uneasily
as
if
resenting
the
interruption
to
his
slumbers
that
the
firm
touch
had
disturbed
and
he
grumbled
sullenly
without
looking
up
what
is
it
the
woman
bent
towards
him
again
and
whispered
a
word
with
you
villon
rose
wearily
to
his
feet
and
as
he
did
so
the
woman
drew
back
towards
the
open
centre
of
the
room
which
now
appeared
to
her
to
be
empty
her
nerves
were
too
highly
strung
to
note
anything
surprising
in
the
disappearance
of
the
two
visitors
if
she
thought
of
them
at
all
it
was
only
to
be
glad
that
they
had
gone
their
ways
and
left
the
place
so
lonely
villon
followed
her
almost
unconsciously
too
sleepy
for
wonder
suddenly
the
woman
threw
off
the
folds
that
muffled
her
face
and
the
vision
that
had
haunted
him
flashed
on
his
frightened
eyes
the
vision
so
proud
so
beautiful
and
young
he
crossed
himself
as
he
questioned
in
a
voice
that
sounded
strangely
alien
to
him
are
you
real
do
i
look
like
a
ghost
the
fair
woman
answered
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
villon
fell
on
his
knees
as
he
seldom
kneeled
in
prayer
while
he
gasped
if
this
be
a
dream
pray
heaven
i
may
never
wake
the
girl
drew
from
her
bosom
a
little
piece
of
folded
parchment
and
held
it
out
towards
him
you
wrote
me
these
verses
my
elders
tell
me
that
poets
say
much
and
mean
little
that
their
oaths
are
like
gingerbread
as
hot
and
sweet
in
the
mouth
and
as
easily
swallowed
you
such
a
one
villon
rose
to
his
feet
he
knew
that
this
exquisite
presence
was
flesh
and
biood
that
her
speech
was
human
speech
he
answered
her
very
gravely
my
words
are
life
i
love
you
just
because
i
show
a
smooth
face
a
great
wave
of
rapture
swept
over
the
poet
soul
and
his
brain
seemed
as
busy
with
words
as
a
hive
with
bees
he
spoke
slowly
like
a
man
inspired
because
you
are
the
loveliest
she
alive
if
all
my
dreams
of
loveliness
had
been
pieced
together
into
one
perfect
woman
she
would
have
been
like
you
all
my
life
i
have
read
tales
of
love
and
tried
to
find
their
secret
in
the
bright
eyes
about
me
tried
and
failed
i
might
as
well
have
been
seeking
for
the
holy
grail
but
when
i
saw
you
the
old
heaven
and
the
old
earth
seemed
to
shrivel
away
and
i
knew
what
love
might
mean
and
desire
and
surrender
the
world
is
changed
by
your
coming
all
sweet
tastes
and
fair
colours
and
soft
sounds
have
something
of
you
in
them
i
eat
and
drink
i
see
and
hear
in
your
honour
the
people
in
the
street
are
blessed
because
you
have
passed
among
them
that
stone
on
the
ground
is
sacred
for
your
foot
has
touched
it
or
the
dusty
booth
at
the
corner
which
your
sleeve
has
brushed
in
passing
i
love
you
all
philosophy
all
wisdom
religion
honour
manhood
hope
beauty
lie
in
those
words
i
love
you
the
girl
looked
at
him
with
wide
eyes
quite
fearless
much
astonished
as
a
brave
maid
might
look
at
some
wild
beast
of
the
woods
that
came
in
her
way
but
the
purport
of
his
words
seemed
to
please
her
for
she
answered
him
quickly
and
readily
well
i
have
come
to
you
to
put
your
protestations
to
the
proof
if
you
meant
every
word
you
said
every
syllable
every
letter
you
can
serve
me
well
if
not
and
and
with
these
words
she
moved
a
little
as
if
she
were
ready
to
say
farewell
to
him
then
and
there
villon
put
forward
an
appealing
hand
that
stayed
her
i
wrote
with
my
heart
blood
he
protested
and
even
a
green
girl
could
not
fail
to
read
the
truth
in
his
voice
now
she
came
close
to
him
speaking
very
low
but
very
distinctly
listen
i
am
one
of
the
queen
ladies
thibaut
the
grand
constable
of
france
loves
me
a
little
and
my
broad
lands
much
he
wills
that
i
should
marry
him
he
tried
to
force
me
to
his
will
to
shame
me
to
his
pleasure
and
so
i
hate
him
and
so
should
you
for
it
was
he
who
gave
you
your
beating
villon
who
had
been
listening
to
her
in
wonder
started
as
if
he
had
been
struck
anew
oh
it
was
he
he
interrupted
the
girl
came
a
little
closer
became
a
little
more
confidential
he
gave
your
rhymes
to
me
and
told
me
how
you
had
been
treated
when
i
read
them
i
said
here
if
a
poet
speaks
truth
is
the
one
man
in
france
who
can
help
me
villon
drew
himself
back
with
a
little
shiver
of
intelligence
the
lumes
of
wine
the
fumes
of
wonder
were
drifting
away
from
him
leaving
him
face
to
face
with
naked
amazing
reality
why
not
your
lover
he
asked
katherine
frowned
disdain
noel
le
jolys
is
a
man
many
women
might
love
but
i
love
no
man
i
only
hate
thibaut
do
you
understand
i
begin
to
understand
villon
answered
sadly
the
girl
came
nearer
to
villon
her
face
was
very
pale
in
the
dim
light
and
a
fleeting
image
of
the
moon
in
clouds
teased
his
fancy
her
lips
were
as
red
he
thought
as
the
ruby
of
a
bishop
ring
and
her
eyes
venus
so
it
was
he
who
trembled
and
not
the
maiden
who
was
saying
strange
words
in
a
clear
whisper
kill
thibaut
you
are
a
skillful
swordsman
they
say
you
are
little
better
than
an
outlaw
you
say
you
love
me
more
than
life
kill
thibaut
villon
looked
at
her
queerly
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
keep
his
face
from
quivering
he
was
eating
his
heart
and
it
tasted
very
bitter
and
his
own
voice
sounded
far
away
to
him
like
a
voice
heard
in
a
dream
so
that
you
and
noel
what
his
name
may
live
happily
ever
after
katherine
drew
back
from
him
a
little
scorn
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
are
you
less
eager
to
serve
me
than
you
were
the
question
struck
him
in
the
breast
like
the
stroke
of
a
sword
he
remembered
his
golden
vows
and
his
golden
verses
and
sickened
at
his
shadow
of
disloyal
doubt
and
anger
no
by
heaven
but
i
been
dozing
and
dreaming
and
i
got
to
rub
the
sleep
out
of
my
eyes
and
the
dream
out
of
my
heart
tell
me
how
to
serve
you
she
was
reassured
on
the
instant
and
neared
him
again
confidently
thibaut
comes
here
he
has
come
here
before
in
disguise
for
i
have
had
him
followed
i
think
he
means
to
betray
the
king
to
burgundy
so
you
will
serve
france
as
well
as
me
how
do
such
men
as
you
kill
each
other
villon
looked
at
her
ironically
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
answered
her
ironically
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
he
saw
himself
as
she
saw
him
and
was
sadly
entertained
at
the
sight
generally
in
a
drunken
scuffle
will
you
wait
here
till
he
comes
pretty
lady
for
i
never
saw
him
then
leave
the
rest
to
me
something
in
his
voice
though
it
was
firm
and
clear
seemed
to
touch
the
girl
ear
more
than
any
word
he
had
yet
uttered
a
new
curiosity
seemed
to
lurk
in
her
eyes
and
there
was
almost
a
sound
of
pity
in
her
speech
you
love
me
very
much
she
asked
softly
villon
drew
himself
up
proudly
and
answered
her
proudly
with
all
the
meaning
that
the
word
can
have
in
paradise
a
faint
shade
of
colour
came
into
the
woman
pale
pure
cheeks
you
did
expect
to
be
taken
at
your
word
villon
smiled
brightly
and
his
eyes
were
dancing
though
his
heart
was
heavy
enough
i
did
hope
to
be
i
will
try
to
be
worthy
of
the
honour
the
girl
eyes
shone
with
wonder
you
love
and
laugh
in
the
same
breath
she
asserted
villon
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
with
his
hands
half
in
protest
half
in
approval
that
is
my
philosophy
this
view
of
life
seemed
to
astonish
her
not
a
little
she
caught
her
breath
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
glided
close
to
him
if
you
wish
she
said
in
an
even
whisper
you
may
kiss
me
once
all
the
blood
in
the
man
heart
seemed
to
turn
to
fire
and
flame
into
his
face
as
he
turned
towards
her
making
as
if
he
would
take
her
face
in
his
hands
and
seal
his
soul
upon
her
mouth
then
he
sharply
flung
himself
away
from
her
nay
i
can
fight
and
if
needs
must
die
in
your
quarrel
but
if
once
i
touched
your
lips
that
would
make
life
too
sweet
to
adventure
the
woman
face
had
flushed
a
little
at
her
offer
it
now
paled
again
as
you
will
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
there
came
the
noise
of
shouting
singing
and
trampling
feet
outside
the
poet
dropped
in
a
moment
from
the
dizzy
pinnacle
of
dreamland
to
the
calm
valley
of
a
commonplace
world
these
are
my
friends
returning
he
said
they
must
see
you
come
this
way
as
he
spoke
he
caught
her
hand
and
drew
her
across
the
room
to
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
upper
gallery
on
the
gallery
he
bade
her
wait
here
you
can
see
without
being
seen
when
he
comes
show
him
to
me
then
you
can
reach
the
street
by
this
passage
even
as
he
spoke
the
main
door
was
dashed
open
and
the
wild
rout
foamed
into
the
room
bubbling
with
exhilaration
huguette
leaping
like
a
bubble
on
the
eddies
of
their
enthusiasm
louis
and
tristan
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
to
emerge
from
their
hiding
places
and
resume
their
seats
at
their
table
that
was
rare

flagons

rattled
as
the

gathered
round

and
renéwed
their
drinking
and
dicing
with
fresh
zest
from
the
scuffle
they
had
just
witnessed

laughed
one
of
his
long

lingered
over

and

they

tristan
even
as
he
spoke
the
inn
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
a
small
man
plainly
clad
with
his
hood
about
his
face
he
glanced
about
him
anxiously
till
he
caught
sight
of
louis
and
tristan
for
whom
he
made
immediately
villon
craning
over
the
balustrade
saw
him
and
touched
the
girl
on
the
arm
to
call
her
attention
to
the
is
that
he
he
whispered
the
girl
shook
her
head
no
no
thibaut
is
a
big
man
yet
that
figure
seems
familiar
the
stranger
came
to
the
table
and
stooped
between
louis
and
tristan
louis
looked
up
and
grinned

glided
through
the
door
behind
which
tristan
had
been
concealed
a
few
moments
before
the
king
rubbed
his
hands
and
chuckled
even
tristan
looked
pleased
chapter
iv
enter
thibaut
once
again
the
door
swung
on
its
hinges
admitting
a
very
tall
powerful
man
dressed
like
a
common
soldier
his
brawny
bulk
panoplied
in
steel
and
leather
he
glanced
about
him
as
he
entered
exchanged
looks
with
rené
de
montigny
and
came
down
to
the
settle
where
he
flung
his
vast
body
with
a
clatter
while
he
called
to
the
landlord
in
a
bull
bellow
to
bring
him
some
wine
katherine
leaning
and
looking
gave
a
little
gasp
that
is
he
she
breathed
into
villon
ear
villon
gave
an
involuntary
sigh
partly
indeed
of
satisfaction
at
the
thought
that
his
quarry
was
before
him
a
very
vast
and
royal
stag
for
a
hunter
hand
to
threaten
but
partly
too
of
exquisite
regret
it
had
been
very
sweet
to
crouch
there
in
the
darkness
of
the
stairway
so
close
to
the
one
fair
woman
of
all
the
world
to
feel
her
breath
upon
his
cheek
almost
to
hear
her
to
know
that
once
if
only
for
once
they
were
alone
together
and
allied
in
a
common
purpose
to
feel
the
touch
of
her
soft
gown
to
know
that
if
he
chose
he
could
touch
her
hair
with
his
outstretched
hand
those
seconds
of
strange
intimacy
seemed
to
be
worth
all
the
rest
of
his
life
and
now
they
had
come
to
an
end
now
he
had
to
show
that
he
deserved
them
good
he
said
and
leaving
her
side
he
softly
descended
the
stairs
crept
across
the
tavern
floor
and
insinuated
himself
dexterously
into
the
society
of
his
friends
who
were
by
this
time
far
too
mad
and
merry
to
show
any
surprise
at
his
sudden
or
to
question
whence
he
came
only
one
of
the
fellowship
was
away
from
the
board
rené
de
montigny
who
had
risen
as
soon
as
the
soldier
had
taken
his
seat
by
the
fireplace
and
had
come
down
to
greet
him
in
a
seemingly
careless
fashion
villon
dexterously
moving
from
friend
to
friend
managed
to
niche
himself
by
the
back
of
the
settle
where
he
could
catch
some
of
the
words
that
passed
between
montigny
and
the
stranger
whose
meeting
was
also
the
subject
of
unsuspected
scrutiny
on
the
part
of
the
unassuming
burgesses
who
sat
apart
and
to
whom
no
one
now
gave
heed
a
fine
evening
friend
montigny
said
affably
pretty
fine
for
the
time
of
year
the
soldier
answered
how
is
your
garden
friend
montigny
smiled
whimsically
very
salubrious
if
it
were
not
for
the
shooting
stars
then
as
the
soldier
stared
at
him
he
hastened
to
explain
my
quip
the
shooting
star
was
a
burgundian
arrow
a
long
which
came
winging
its
way
over
the
walls
at
noon
and
made
itself
at
home
in
my
garden
here
is
what
the
arrow
carried
he
pulled
from
his
pouch
a
small
piece
of
parchment
folded
and
sealed
and
handed
it
to
the
seeming
soldier
the
disguised
constable
took
the
missive
and
scanned
it
narrowly
the
seal
has
not
been
tampered
with
he
said
to
himself
ren
caught
him
up
with
a
noble
gesture
of
indignation
i
never
read
other
people
letters
he
protested
thibaut
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
would
have
profited
you
little
if
you
had
he
said
as
he
broke
the
seal
and
turning
aside
stooped
a
little
to
read
by
the
faint
fire
light
what
the
letter
said
it
was
couched
in
words
that
seemed
commonplace
enough
but
thibaut
knew
their
secret
meaning
knew
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
would
do
all
that
he
asked
give
him
a
duchy
give
him
the
girl
he
coveted
all
that
he
might
ask
for
or
lust
for
if
he
would
only
play
the
traitor
and
deliver
louis
into
the
duke
of
burgundy
hands
as
this
was
precisely
what
thibaut
was
resolved
to
do
a
pleased
smile
played
over
his
lips
as
he
tossed
the
parchment
into
the
glowing
ashes
and
watched
it
wither
into
nothingness
he
turned
to
montigny
who
was
watching
him
attentively
can
you
command
some
safe
rogues
of
your
kidney
who
think
better
of
burgundian
gold
than
of
the
fool
on
the
throne
montigny
answered
him
behind
his
hand
aye
i
know
of
half
a
dozen
stout
lads
who
would
pilfer
the
king
from
his
palace
of
the
louvre
if
they
were
paid
well
enough
for
the
job
and
he
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
his
carousing
comrades
thibaut
nodded
approval
he
thrust
some
gold
into
montigny
ready
palm
whispered
to
him
to
meet
him
again
and
as
montigny
rejoined
his
friends
he
turned
to
leave
the
tavern
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
confronted
by
villon
who
feigning
intoxication
barred
his
passage
with
an
air
of
great
hilarity
you
walk
abroad
late
honest
soldier
he
hiccoughed
that
my
business
thibaut
answered
trying
to
pass
but
villon
still
delayed
him
do
be
testy
come
and
crack
a
bottle
i
had
enough
and
you
had
more
than
enough
thibaut
growled
go
to
bed
villon
false
good
humour
changed
in
a
clap
you
a
damned
uncivil
fellow
soldier
and
do
know
how
to
treat
a
gentleman
when
you
see
one
thibaut
began
to
lose
patience
get
out
of
the
way
he
said
and
gave
villon
a
little
push
with
his
open
hand
that
made
him
stagger
villon
voice
rose
to
a
yell
i
will
not
get
out
of
the
way
how
do
i
know
you
are
an
honest
soldier
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
a
true
man
as
villon
voice
rose
the
altercation
attracted
the
attention
of
the
revellers
montigny
glided
to
villon
side
and
whispered
him
let
him
alone
françois
he
not
what
he
seems
seems
who
cares
what
he
seems
villon
shouted
it
what
he
is
i
want
to
know
perhaps
he
not
an
honest
soldier
at
all
he
a
damned
burgundian
spy
thibaut
lifted
his
hand
to
crush
villon
but
the
poet
naked
dagger
menaced
him
and
he
paused
fling
this
drunken
dog
into
the
street
he
commanded
angrily
villon
friends
snapped
at
him
furiously
villon
flung
back
the
phrase
drunken
dog
indeed
you
are
a
lying
knave
keep
the
door
friends
this
rogue
has
insulted
me
pluck
out
your
iron
soldier
in
a
moment
the
whole
pack
were
between
thibaut
and
the
door
every
woman
a
fury
every
man
a
fighter
every
man
with
the
exception
of
rené
de
montigny
who
dexterously
disentangling
himself
from
the
mass
of
his
companions
made
for
the
side
door
and
slipped
out
of
it
unheeded
in
the
confusion
it
was
his
intention
to
alarm
the
watch
and
intervene
for
the
protection
of
his
powerful
patron
and
with
this
purpose
in
his
mind
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
street
and
ran
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
in
the
meantime
the
quarrel
at
the
fircone
raged
hotter
thibaut
glaring
at
his
enemies
as
a
bull
might
glare
at
barking
dogs
asked
savagely
of
the
poet
who
was
brandishing
his
sword
who
the
devil
are
you
villon
flung
has
head
back
defiantly
and
flourished
his
sword
i
am
françois
villon
and
my
sword
is
as
good
as
another
man
the
moment
the
name
fell
on
thibaut
ears
the
giant
gave
a
laugh
are
you
françois
villon
he
thundered
lend
me
a
cudgel
some
one
and
he
looked
around
as
if
seeking
for
the
weapon
he
asked
snatched
up
a
mug
and
flung
the
heel
taps
in
the
soldier
face
spotting
his
cheeks
with
drops
of
crimson
that
trickled
on
to
his
breast
plate
with
a
choking
cry
of
rage
thibaut
dragged
his
sword
into
the
air
you
fool
he
hissed
i
kill
you
we
shall
see
villon
answered
gallantly
as
he
stood
on
guard
alert
and
wary
for
a
moment
the
and
held
their
breath
the
great
figure
in
the
shining
steel
seemed
so
to
dominate
the
slight
frame
of
their
favourite
that
anything
like
an
equal
contest
between
the
two
men
seemed
little
less
than
ridiculous
what
skill
of
villon
could
hope
to
avail
against
the
mighty
sweep
of
that
huge
soldier
weapon
suddenly
the
swift
spirit
of
huguette
solved
the
problem
springing
forward
with
the
delicate
agility
of
a
young
panther
she
poised
opinionative
between
the
opponents
fair
play
she
screamed
this
is
david
and
goliath
and
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
with
one
hand
at
villon
while
with
the
other
she
struck
with
her
open
palm
a
ringing
blow
on
the
cuirass
of
antagonist
let
them
fight
it
out
with
sword
and
lantern
in
the
dark
a
loud
shout
of
applause
greeted
the
girl
suggestion
that
fantastic
form
of
duello
was
not
unfamiliar
to
the
free
companions
of
the
court
of
miracles
and
villon
himself
eager
as
he
was
for
the
combat
was
keen
enough
to
see
how
well
this
way
might
work
for
the
surety
of
his
purpose
skill
inches
tricks
of
fence
all
things
were
equal
when
men
fought
as
shadows
in
shadowland
what
do
you
say
goliath
he
laughed
and
the
grim
face
of
thibaut
smiled
responsive
as
you
please
he
said
serenely
confident
in
his
strength
and
length
of
arm
it
is
all
one
to
me
then
suddenly
looking
round
on
the
leering
sullen
faces
about
him
a
wolfish
girdle
of
ferocity
he
caught
back
his
agreement
and
held
it
for
a
moment
on
this
condition
he
added
when
there
is
an
end
of
you
there
is
an
end
of
the
quarrel
your
friends
here
must
agree
to
that
villon
agreed
on
the
instant
he
was
all
for
ridding
the
world
of
thibaut
but
he
wanted
to
do
it
himself
for
the
sake
of
the
white
girl
crouching
on
the
stairway
i
promise
he
said
for
myself
and
for
them
and
turning
to
the
girl
he
insisted
promise
huguette
swear
it
i
swear
it
huguette
answered
that
is
settled
said
villon
now
friends
make
a
ring
and
dowse
the
glim
in
another
instant
the
preparations
for
the
combat
were
afoot
robin
turgis
angrily
protesting
against
the
desecration
of
his
orderly
hostelry
and
shouting
wild
words
about
summoning
the
watch
was
promptly
overpowered
by
jehan
le
loup
who
forced
him
on
to
a
bench
and
kept
him
there
with
a
dagger
point
at
his
throat
the
women
huddled
screaming
and
excited
on
the
stairway
a
little
below
the
place
where
katherine
crouched
holding
her
breath
and
peeping
through
the
railings
the
men
stood
behind
tables
and
on
benches
while
casin
cholet
and
colin
de
cayeulx
dived
into
the
quarters
and
reappeared
bearing
each
in
his
hand
a
lighted
lantern
while
these
preparations
were
being
hurried
toward
tristan
full
of
alarm
leaned
forward
and
plucked
at
the
king
mantle
this
must
be
put
a
stop
to
sire
he
whispered
but
the
king
shook
his
head
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
on
the
contrary
gossip
he
answered
whichever
of
these
rascals
kills
the
other
does
the
state
a
service
and
saves
the
hangman
some
labour
villon
crossed
the
room
and
came
close
to
where
thibaut
waited
sullen
i
think
i
shall
square
our
reckoning
master
thibaut
he
whispered
the
giant
stared
at
him
you
know
me
he
gasped
your
varlets
thumped
me
yesterday
villon
answered
i
shall
tickle
you
turn
turn
about
friend
thibaut
even
as
he
spoke
guy
tabarie
puffed
out
the
last
candle
left
alight
in
the
room
which
was
plunged
instantly
into
almost
total
darkness
even
the
faint
moonlight
that
had
come
through
the
window
was
swiftly
veiled
by
huguette
who
drew
the
crimson
curtains
close
together
the
dim
light
from
the
fire
only
seemed
to
accentuate
and
intensify
the
darkness
through
which
the
two
lanterns
burned
pale
planets
of
yellow
fire
in
the
hands
of
casin
and
colin
villon
snatched
the
one
and
thibaut
took
the
other
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
silence
then
the
voice
of
huguette
cried
out
of
the
blackness
are
you
ready
both
combatants
cried
yes
in
the
same
breath
and
in
the
next
the
battle
began
no
stranger
fight
had
ever
been
fought
within
those
walls
before
or
even
perhaps
within
the
walls
of
paris
in
the
dense
obscurity
the
two
antagonists
groped
for
each
other
alternately
guided
and
baffled
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
as
their
holder
lifted
his
light
suddenly
in
the
air
or
dexterously
concealed
it
under
the
fold
of
his
mantle
every
now
and
then
the
swords
would
meet
with
a
clash
there
would
be
a
hurried
exchange
of
thrust
and
blow
and
then
the
adversaries
would
drift
back
again
to
grope
and
gleam
and
seek
each
other
anew
their
lanterns
flashing
and
disappearing
like
accentuated
and
their
blades
now
shining
in
sudden
illumination
like
streaks
of
blue
lightning
across
the
blackness
and
now
invisible
even
to
those
who
held
them
in
their
hands
tristan
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
king
to
leave
before
the
preliminaries
for
the
fantastic
strife
had
been
completed
but
louis
was
firm
in
his
determination
to
remain
i
would
not
miss
this
for
the
world
man
he
had
insisted
all
his
childlike
delight
in
the
adventurous
was
being
sated
to
the
full
this
evening
and
there
was
no
happier
man
at
that
moment
in
the
kingdom
than
the
man
who
by
strange
fortune
was
its
king
the
fight
persisted
for
some
minutes
that
seemed
like
hours
to
more
than
one
of
the
anxious
spectators
now
the
room
would
be
steeped
in
the
deepest
silence
and
now
as
the
revealed
lantern
glowed
and
the
naked
weapons
met
some
woman
scream
or
some
man
suppressed
oath
would
fill
the
place
with
a
sense
of
watching
eager
humanity
suddenly
when
the
tension
of
watcher
and
watched
was
keenest
there
came
a
mighty
crashing
at
the
door
and
a
voice
shouted
loudly
a
summons
to
open
in
the
king
name
tristan
knew
well
enough
what
the
summons
meant
it
is
the
watch
sire
he
whispered
to
the
king
thibaut
too
groping
for
his
nimble
antagonist
and
beginning
to
despair
of
crushing
the
man
heard
and
understood
the
summons
he
was
tired
of
the
baffling
struggle
open
the
door
he
shouted
noisily
and
the
cry
stirred
villon
to
a
more
vehement
assault
he
sprang
like
a
cat
at
the
giant
flashed
the
lantern
dazzlingly
in
his
eyes
and
as
thibaut
furious
made
a
wild
lunge
at
him
villon
dexterously
swung
his
lantern
on
to
his
enemy
sword
point
and
in
another
second
had
driven
his
own
blade
into
thibaut
side
not
so
fast
he
shouted
exultantly
and
as
thibaut
fell
with
a
heavy
crash
of
rattling
armour
on
the
floor
the
door
was
dashed
open
and
the
armed
watch
poured
in
with
blazing
torches
filling
the
room
with
light
and
armoured
men
françois
after
a
moment
glance
of
triumph
at
the
fallen
giant
sprang
round
and
glanced
up
at
the
gallery
katherine
standing
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
flung
a
knot
of
ribbon
to
her
champion
who
caught
it
as
it
skimmed
through
the
air
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
thrust
it
into
the
bosom
of
his
jerkin
in
another
moment
katherine
had
disappeared
and
villon
found
himself
roughly
held
in
the
strong
grasp
of
two
soldiers
while
the
captain
of
the
watch
surveyed
the
scene
with
some
astonishment
and
the
rogues
were
overawed
by
the
bills
of
the
what
is
this
tumult
the
captain
demanded
villon
answered
him
airily
smiling
over
the
crossed
pikes
that
penned
him
a
fair
fight
good
captain
conducted
according
to
the
honourable
laws
of
sword
and
lantern
the
captain
of
the
watch
turned
his
attention
to
thibaut
who
assisted
by
one
of
the
soldiers
had
raised
himself
upon
one
elbow
and
was
glaring
vindictively
at
villon
who
is
this
man
he
asked
a
desire
for
revenge
got
the
better
of
the
wounded
man
discretion
i
am
thibaut
he
gasped
i
am
the
grand
constable
a
little
shiver
of
surprise
and
alarm
ran
round
the
room
at
the
sound
of
that
dreaded
name
the
captain
of
the
watch
kneeled
in
salutation
monseigneur
he
said
how
did
this
happen
thibaut
senses
were
running
away
from
him
with
his
running
blood
but
malignity
overcrowed
weakness
for
a
moment
he
pointed
at
villon
take
that
fellow
and
hang
him
on
the
nearest
lantern
and
as
he
spoke
he
swooned
promptly
the
captain
turned
towards
his
prisoner
take
that
fellow
outside
and
hang
him
he
commanded
curtly
villon
glanced
wildly
about
for
a
way
to
escape
and
saw
none
his
friends
gave
a
groan
of
sympathy
but
they
could
do
no
more
for
the
soldiers
overawed
them
huguette
flung
her
arms
about
him
sobbing
the
grasp
of
his
captors
tightened
and
villon
shivered
at
the
clasp
suddenly
the
little
insignificant
burgess
at
the
table
rose
and
advanced
towards
the
soldier
stop
sir
he
said
imperatively
that
young
gentleman
is
my
affair
the
soldier
turned
angrily
upon
the
interfering
citizen
who
are
you
he
growled
who
dare
to
interfere
with
the
justice
the
citizen
pulled
his
heavy
cap
from
his
head
and
revealed
the
wrinkled
eager
visage
that
was
so
well
known
and
so
well
feared
i
am
the
king
justice
he
said
simply
while
tristan
behind
him
cried
god
save
the
king
and
the
astonished
soldier
bent
the
knee
in
homage
villon
staring
dumfounded
caught
the
humour
of
the
situation
and
could
not
hold
his
tongue
the
king
good
lord
he
said
and
punctuated
his
comment
with
a
prolonged
whistle
chapter
v
the
voices
of
the
stars
louis
loved
roses
all
that
was
royal
in
his
nature
went
out
to
the
royal
flower
whatever
desire
of
beauty
lay
hidden
in
his
heart
found
its
gratification
in
its
splendid
colours
in
its
splendid
odours
the
greeks
believed
that
the
red
rose
only
came
into
being
on
the
fair
day
when
venus
seeing
ascanius
slumbering
on
a
bed
of
white
roses
pressed
handsful
of
the
blossoms
to
her
lips
and
the
pale
petals
blushed
into
their
crimson
loveliness
beneath
the
kisses
of
the
goddess
louis
the
eleventh
knew
nothing
of
the
legend
but
the
red
rose
was
his
fancy
and
a
corner
of
the
royal
garden
was
dedicated
to
its
service
in
the
oldest
part
of
the
palace
hard
by
the
grey
and
ancient
tower
where
the
king
loved
to
the
stars
and
to
brood
over
strange
wisdom
overlooked
by
a
terrace
whose
very
steps
were
littered
with
petals
the
caressed
earth
glowed
into
a
very
miracle
of
roses
every
shade
of
red
that
a
rose
can
wear
was
represented
in
that
dazzling
pleasaunce
from
the
faint
pink
that
surely
the
lips
of
divinity
had
scarcely
brushed
to
the
smiling
scarlet
that
suggested
aphrodite
mouth
from
the
imperial
purple
of
a
caesar
pomp
to
the
crimson
so
deep
that
it
was
almost
black
black
as
the
congealed
blood
on
the
torn
thigh
of
adonis
here
when
the
stars
eluded
or
deceived
him
king
louis
would
come
creeping
down
the
winding
stairs
of
his
tower
with
the
names
of
saints
upon
his
thin
lips
to
breathe
the
sunlit
or
moonlit
fragrance
of
his
roses
to
seek
a
little
rest
for
his
restless
mind
a
little
quiet
for
his
unquiet
heart
on
the
morning
after
his
visit
to
the
fircone
tavern
king
louis
sat
in
his
rose
garden
and
snuffed
the
scented
air
with
pleasure
while
his
keen
eyes
shifted
from
a
scroll
of
parchment
on
his
knee
to
the
face
of
one
who
stood
beside
him
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
marks
and
figures
on
the
outspread
parchment
the
king
companion
was
an
old
man
in
a
furred
gown
whose
countenance
was
seamed
with
years
and
study
and
whose
eyes
seemed
always
to
be
gazing
at
objects
that
others
could
not
see
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
large
sphere
of
crystal
and
whenever
the
king
lapsed
into
silent
study
of
his
scroll
the
sage
would
lift
the
shining
globe
and
gaze
into
its
glassy
depths
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
wisdom
from
one
of
these
moments
of
abstraction
the
king
suddenly
looked
up
and
immediately
the
astrologer
glance
swung
from
the
sphere
to
the
face
of
louis
you
know
the
aspect
of
the
planetary
bodies
said
the
king
and
you
know
of
the
strange
dream
that
i
have
dreamed
three
nights
running
the
sage
inclined
his
head
gravely
the
king
had
told
him
of
the
dream
in
all
its
particulars
at
least
a
dozen
times
that
morning
it
seemed
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
sunlight
and
the
scent
of
the
roses
to
be
a
portion
of
the
chorus
of
the
birds
but
he
listened
to
the
narrative
with
the
same
air
of
surprised
attention
that
he
had
offered
to
its
first
recital
i
dreamed
that
i
was
a
swine
rooting
in
the
streets
of
paris
and
that
i
found
a
pearl
of
great
price
in
the
gutter
i
set
it
in
my
crown
and
it
filled
all
paris
with
its
light
but
it
seemed
to
grow
so
heavy
for
my
forehead
that
i
cast
it
from
me
and
would
have
trodden
it
into
the
earth
but
that
a
star
fell
from
heaven
and
stayed
me
and
i
awoke
trembling
the
king
nasal
voice
droned
through
the
familiar
repetition
then
he
suddenly
turned
his
head
with
a
kind
of
alacrity
upon
the
astrologer
and
asked
sharply
well
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
astrologer
shook
his
head
the
stars
are
bright
he
said
slowly
but
their
brightness
is
bewildering
to
mortal
eyes
and
it
is
hard
to
read
between
the
lines
of
their
effulgence
dreams
are
dim
and
it
is
difficult
for
mortal
minds
to
interpret
their
obscurity
the
king
frowned
i
know
well
enough
he
said
that
stars
are
bright
and
that
dreams
are
dim
but
your
wisdom
is
clothed
and
housed
and
nourished
for
deeper
knowledge
than
this
interpret
my
dream
for
france
as
joseph
interpreted
the
vision
of
the
egyptian
with
an
unmoved
face
the
astrologer
scanned
the
crystal
thus
i
seem
to
read
the
riddle
of
your
dream
sire
he
answered
there
is
one
in
the
depths
who
if
exalted
to
the
heights
might
do
you
great
service
and
who
yet
might
irk
you
so
greatly
that
you
would
seek
to
cast
him
back
again
into
the
depths
from
which
he
rose
the
stars
seem
to
speak
of
such
a
coming
and
as
it
seems
to
me
this
stranger
should
have
potent
influence
for
good
for
a
period
of
seven
days
from
this
day
i
have
sought
and
sought
in
vain
to
see
something
of
this
man
in
the
crystal
i
only
see
confusedly
great
crowds
of
people
pageants
and
masques
and
movings
of
many
soldiers
battle
and
bloodshed
and
great
victory
for
france
and
then
a
star
falls
from
heaven
and
all
the
vision
vanishes
the
king
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
with
an
imperative
gesture
he
dismissed
the
astrologer
who
entered
the
tower
and
climbed
the
winding
stairs
to
the
room
where
he
pursued
his
occult
studies
the
king
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
indifferent
to
the
roses
thinking
only
of
the
stars
if
françois
villon
were
the
king
of
france
he
muttered
how
that
mad
ballad
maker
glowed
last
night
fools
are
proverbially
fortunate
and
a
mad
man
may
save
paris
for
me
as
a
mad
maid
saved
france
for
my
sire
a
heavy
tread
behind
him
stirred
him
from
his
meditations
turning
he
beheld
the
companion
of
his
adventure
of
the
previous
evening
well
tristan
he
questioned
apprehensively
for
tristan
had
the
evil
smile
on
his
face
which
he
always
wore
when
he
had
news
of
any
disagreeable
kind
to
impart
the
bird
has
flown
sire
he
said
thibaut
wound
was
much
slighter
than
we
thought
last
night
after
we
carried
him
to
his
house
he
made
his
escape
thence
in
disguise
and
has
as
i
believe
fled
from
paris
to
join
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
king
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
i
wish
the
duke
joy
of
him
he
said
he
is
more
dangerous
to
my
enemy
when
he
is
on
my
enemy
side
where
are
the
rascals
of
last
night
the
tavern
rabble
are
in
custody
of
messire
noel
and
my
rival
for
royalty
barber
olivier
has
charge
of
him
i
would
have
hanged
the
rogue
out
of
hand
your
turn
will
come
gossip
never
doubt
it
but
the
stars
warn
me
that
i
need
this
rhyming
ragamuffin
there
is
a
tale
of
haroun
al
raschid
tristan
stifled
a
yawn
and
a
sneer
another
tale
sire
he
said
with
something
like
piteous
protest
for
the
king
tales
did
not
always
entertain
tristan
louis
went
on
however
indifferent
to
his
companion
feelings
how
he
picked
a
drunken
rascal
from
the
streets
and
took
him
to
his
palace
when
the
rascal
woke
sober
the
courtiers
persuaded
him
that
he
was
the
caliph
and
the
commander
of
the
faithful
found
great
sport
in
his
behaviour
i
promise
myself
a
like
diversion
tristan
stared
in
surprise
this
form
of
entertainment
was
new
to
him
and
did
not
seem
to
be
particularly
amusing
are
you
going
to
let
him
think
he
is
king
sire
he
asked
a
queer
smile
wrinkled
the
king
malign
face
not
quite
he
said
when
he
wakes
he
is
to
be
assured
that
he
is
the
count
of
montcorbier
and
grand
constable
of
france
his
antics
may
amuse
me
his
lucky
star
may
serve
me
and
his
winning
tongue
may
help
to
avenge
me
on
a
certain
froward
maid
who
disdained
me
send
me
here
olivier
tristan
bowed
gravely
and
turned
on
his
heel
in
his
heart
he
was
inclined
to
a
kind
of
contempt
for
the
monarch
humours
when
there
was
a
chance
of
hanging
a
man
it
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
time
to
play
the
fool
in
this
fashion
the
cat
and
mouse
policy
was
never
tristan
way
he
was
ever
for
the
dog
way
with
the
rat
louis
resumed
his
restless
walk
with
his
hands
folded
behind
him
and
his
head
thrust
forward
as
if
he
were
scanning
the
ground
for
some
lost
object
his
mind
was
busy
revolving
many
thoughts
he
knew
very
well
how
precarious
his
position
was
how
unpopular
he
was
with
his
people
how
strong
were
the
forces
that
the
duke
of
burgundy
had
arrayed
against
him
how
little
he
could
count
upon
the
allegiance
of
the
people
of
paris
if
once
the
enemy
were
able
to
put
a
foot
within
the
walls
of
the
capital
city
he
was
very
ambitious
he
was
very
confident
he
was
very
brave
and
yet
he
felt
that
ambition
confidence
and
courage
were
not
enough
at
that
crisis
to
give
his
throne
support
the
superstitious
side
of
his
nature
turned
restlessly
to
the
unknown
and
his
spirit
dived
into
crystals
or
soared
among
the
spinning
planets
struggling
for
occult
enlightenment
to
the
superstitious
trifles
are
the
giants
of
destiny
and
the
king
escapade
of
the
previous
evening
had
taken
a
firm
hold
on
his
fancy
the
picturesque
blackguard
who
had
mouthed
so
gallantly
his
desire
to
reign
over
france
and
save
her
would
in
any
case
have
tickled
the
king
taste
for
the
eccentric
but
when
the
encounter
with
the
poet
came
upon
the
heels
of
the
strange
dream
and
was
followed
by
the
vague
prognostications
of
the
the
business
loomed
majestic
in
his
eyes
he
had
always
before
his
mind
the
memory
of
the
radiant
saintly
maiden
who
had
come
like
a
messenger
from
heaven
to
help
his
father
when
his
father
fortunes
seemed
to
be
in
the
very
dust
and
it
was
in
all
seriousness
that
he
permitted
himself
to
hope
and
almost
to
believe
that
some
such
succour
might
be
vouchsafed
him
from
the
fantastic
rhymester
who
had
so
lately
hectored
him
in
tho
fircone
tavern
as
the
king
lifted
his
eyes
a
fairer
form
than
that
of
villon
was
impressed
upon
his
consciousness
and
yet
the
sight
only
served
to
strengthen
the
current
of
the
king
thoughts
a
very
beautiful
girl
tall
stately
imperious
was
coming
down
one
of
the
roseways
with
her
arms
full
of
the
great
crimson
blossoms
if
the
king
had
been
a
scholar
in
the
learning
of
the
greeks
he
would
have
compared
the
girl
to
some
one
of
the
glorious
goddesses
of
the
hellenic
pantheon
as
it
was
he
was
merely
aware
in
a
fierce
way
that
the
girl
was
very
beautiful
that
her
beauty
appealed
to
him
very
keenly
and
stirred
in
him
a
keen
sense
of
resentment
at
his
slighted
homage
this
girl
whom
thibaut
wanted
to
marry
this
girl
whom
the
king
coveted
this
girl
whom
the
mad
poet
worshipped
what
part
would
she
play
in
the
fantastic
comedy
which
was
gradually
shaping
itself
in
the
distorted
mind
of
louis
katherine
de
vaucelles
saw
the
king
and
dropped
him
a
stately
curtsey
where
are
you
going
girl
louis
asked
she
answered
quietly
to
her
majesty
sire
who
bade
me
gather
roses
give
me
one
said
the
king
and
then
as
the
girl
handed
him
one
of
the
longest
and
reddest
of
her
splendid
cargo
the
king
lightly
swaying
the
flower
brushed
the
girl
flower
face
with
it
and
surveyed
her
mockingly
you
are
a
pretty
child
he
said
you
might
have
had
a
love
well
well
you
were
a
fool
does
not
thibaut
woo
you
he
professes
to
love
me
sire
and
i
profess
to
hate
him
he
was
sorely
wounded
last
night
in
a
tavern
scuffle
the
girl
gave
a
little
cry
of
disappointment
only
wounded
sire
the
king
laughed
heartily
your
solicitude
is
adorable
be
of
cheer
he
may
recover
and
we
have
clapped
hands
on
his
assassin
he
shall
pay
the
penalty
katherine
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
king
her
eyes
were
very
eager
and
there
was
eagerness
in
the
tones
of
her
voice
sire
i
bear
this
man
no
malice
for
hurting
thibaut
you
are
clemency
itself
it
would
never
do
to
have
a
woman
on
the
throne
but
to
hurt
a
great
lord
is
to
hurt
the
whole
body
politic
he
shall
swing
for
it
the
girl
frowned
slightly
this
man
should
not
die
sire
thibaut
was
a
traitor
a
villain
louis
mirth
deepened
but
he
kept
the
gravity
of
his
speech
take
care
sweeting
lest
you
wade
out
of
your
depth
but
you
women
are
fountains
of
compassion
if
this
knave
life
interests
you
plead
for
it
to
my
lord
the
grand
constable
the
girl
made
a
gesture
of
despair
thibaut
is
pitiless
she
said
her
mouth
hardened
as
she
thought
of
the
man
she
hated
and
of
her
own
failure
to
thrust
him
from
her
path
but
it
softened
again
on
the
next
words
of
the
king
thibaut
is
no
longer
in
office
try
your
luck
with
his
successor
she
leaned
forward
beseechingly
his
name
sire
louis
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
he
is
the
count
of
montcorbier
he
said
he
is
a
stranger
in
our
court
but
he
has
found
a
lodging
in
my
heart
he
came
under
safe
conduct
from
the
south
last
night
he
is
recommended
to
me
highly
by
our
brother
of
provence
i
believe
he
will
serve
me
well
and
i
am
sure
he
will
always
be
lenient
to
loveliness
the
king
smiled
affably
as
the
ready
lies
slipped
smoothly
from
his
lips
he
was
amusing
himself
immensely
with
the
threads
of
the
fairy
tale
he
was
spinning
you
shall
have
audience
with
him
the
king
paused
he
caught
sight
on
the
steps
of
the
dark
familiar
figure
of
the
royal
barber
who
was
approaching
him
deferentially
he
called
to
him
olivier
by
and
by
when
my
lord
of
montcorbier
takes
the
air
in
the
garden
bring
this
lady
to
him
you
understand
he
turned
to
katherine
again
and
once
more
tickled
her
chin
with
the
swaying
rose
now
go
girl
or
my
wife
and
your
queen
will
be
wanting
her
roses
katherine
again
saluted
the
king
and
went
slowly
up
the
steps
into
the
palace
louis
watched
her
as
she
went
watched
her
until
she
was
out
of
sight
and
then
turned
sharply
upon
his
servant
well
goodman
barber
what
of
françois
villon
a
pot
of
drugged
wine
last
night
sent
him
to
sleep
in
a
prison
this
morning
he
woke
in
a
palace
lapped
in
the
linen
of
a
royal
bed
he
has
been
washed
and
barbered
sumptuously
dressed
and
rarely
perfumed
he
is
so
changed
that
his
dearest
friend
would
not
know
him
again
he
does
not
seem
to
know
himself
he
carries
himself
as
if
he
had
been
a
courtier
all
his
days
the
king
chuckled
i
have
little
doubt
that
when
the
jackass
wore
the
lion
skin
he
thought
himself
the
lion
but
is
he
not
amazed
too
much
amazed
sire
to
betray
amazement
his
attendants
assure
him
with
the
gravest
faces
that
he
is
the
grand
constable
of
france
i
believe
he
thinks
himself
in
a
dream
and
finding
the
dream
delicate
accepts
it
remember
said
louis
to
keep
to
the
tale
this
fellow
came
here
from
provence
last
night
none
must
know
who
he
is
save
you
and
i
and
tristan
blow
it
about
to
all
the
court
that
he
is
the
count
of
montcorbier
the
favourite
of
our
brother
of
provence
and
now
my
friend
and
counsellor
i
have
a
liking
for
you
olivier
as
you
know
and
tristan
and
i
are
very
good
friends
but
neither
of
your
heads
are
safe
on
their
shoulders
if
this
sport
of
mine
be
spoiled
by
indiscretions
olivier
bowed
deeply
i
can
not
speak
for
tristan
sire
he
said
but
i
can
speak
for
myself
the
god
harpocrates
is
not
more
symbolical
of
silence
than
i
when
it
is
my
business
to
hold
my
tongue
it
is
well
said
louis
i
will
answer
for
tristan
have
this
fellow
sent
to
me
here
with
another
reverence
olivier
left
the
king
and
ascended
the
steps
into
the
palace
the
king
sniffed
pensively
at
the
rose
which
katherine
had
given
to
him
the
perfume
seemed
to
sooth
him
and
he
mused
sunning
himself
and
feeding
his
fancy
with
the
entertainment
which
playing
with
the
lives
of
others
always
afforded
to
him
this
jack
and
jill
shall
dance
to
my
whimsy
like
dolls
upon
a
wire
it
would
be
rare
sport
if
mistress
katherine
disdained
louis
to
decline
upon
this
beggar
he
shall
hang
for
mocking
me
but
he
carried
himself
like
a
king
for
all
his
tatters
and
patches
and
he
shall
taste
of
splendour
glancing
up
at
the
terrace
he
perceived
the
returning
figure
of
olivier
le
dain
and
guessed
that
his
henchman
was
serving
as
herald
to
the
new
grand
constable
behind
olivier
came
a
little
cluster
of
pages
and
behind
them
again
the
king
could
see
a
shining
figure
in
cloth
of
gold
here
comes
my
mountebank
he
said
to
himself
as
pompous
as
if
he
were
born
to
the
purple
he
moved
swiftly
to
the
door
of
the
tower
and
entered
it
disappearing
as
the
little
procession
descended
the
steps
into
the
rose
garden
there
was
a
little
grating
in
the
door
of
the
tower
a
little
grating
with
a
sliding
shutter
and
through
this
grating
the
king
now
peered
with
infinite
entertainment
at
the
progress
of
the
comedy
himself
had
planned
olivier
had
spoken
truly
when
he
said
that
master
villon
had
been
greatly
changed
the
barber
own
handiwork
had
so
cleansed
and
shaved
his
countenance
had
so
trimmed
and
readjusted
his
locks
that
his
face
now
shone
as
different
from
the
face
of
the
as
the
face
of
the
moon
shines
from
the
face
of
a
lantern
he
was
as
sumptuously
attired
as
if
he
were
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
the
noonday
sun
seemed
to
take
fresh
lustre
from
his
suit
of
cloth
of
gold
the
air
to
be
enriched
by
his
perfume
the
world
to
be
vastly
the
better
for
his
furs
and
jewels
though
it
was
plain
that
the
poet
was
in
a
desperate
dilemma
he
managed
to
bear
himself
with
a
dignity
that
consorted
royally
with
his
pomp
olivier
bowed
low
to
the
figure
in
cloth
of
gold
will
your
dignity
deign
to
linger
awhile
in
this
rose
arbour
he
asked
the
gentleman
in
cloth
of
gold
looked
at
him
in
wonder
in
truth
the
gentleman
in
cloth
of
gold
was
in
a
very
bewildered
frame
of
mind
he
had
seen
but
now
a
clean
and
face
in
the
mirror
with
elegantly
trimmed
hair
and
he
tried
to
associate
the
image
in
the
mirror
with
his
own
familiar
face
unwashed
unkempt
unshaven
he
eyed
the
splendid
clothes
that
covered
him
and
his
memory
fumbled
in
perplexity
over
the
horrors
of
a
dingy
filthy
wardrobe
ragged
and
ancient
he
looked
at
the
solemn
pages
who
stood
about
him
with
golden
cups
and
golden
flagons
in
their
hands
and
he
tried
to
remember
how
he
had
escaped
from
the
society
of
master
robin
turgis
into
this
gilded
environment
his
head
ached
with
the
endeavour
and
he
abandoned
it
olivier
repeated
his
question
and
at
last
villon
found
words
though
his
voice
sounded
strange
and
hollow
on
his
ears
and
hard
to
command
my
dignity
will
deign
to
do
anything
you
suggest
good
master
blackamoor
he
answered
but
to
his
heart
he
whispered
that
it
was
better
to
humour
these
strange
satellites
whose
persons
he
found
it
impossible
to
reconcile
with
any
memories
of
the
real
world
as
he
knew
it
the
barber
bowed
deferentially
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
presently
with
certain
small
cares
of
state
he
said
villon
beamed
on
him
benignly
he
was
wondering
what
his
interlocutor
was
talking
about
but
he
felt
that
it
was
the
course
of
the
wise
man
to
betray
no
wonder
the
conditions
were
indeed
bewildering
but
also
they
were
not
disagreeable
and
it
was
as
well
to
take
them
cheerfully
no
trouble
excellent
myrmidon
he
answered
these
duties
are
pleasures
to
your
true
man
olivier
bowed
anew
his
majesty
will
probably
honour
you
with
his
company
later
villon
beamed
again
and
again
his
wonder
found
words
which
seemed
to
him
to
make
the
most
and
the
best
of
the
situation
perhaps
in
this
singular
region
of
dreams
he
was
the
king
man
and
the
friend
at
least
it
could
do
no
harm
to
assume
such
friendship
when
his
solemn
companion
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
always
delighted
to
see
dear
louis
he
and
i
are
very
good
friends
people
say
hard
things
of
him
but
believe
me
they
do
know
him
he
was
trying
his
best
to
piece
together
the
disordered
fragments
of
his
memory
and
to
explain
to
himself
how
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
on
terms
of
friendship
with
the
king
his
head
was
dizzy
and
heavy
and
he
felt
like
a
man
in
a
dark
room
who
was
groping
to
find
the
door
handle
the
voice
of
the
barber
interrupted
these
mental
struggles
may
we
take
our
leave
monseigneur
villon
face
lighted
he
felt
that
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
him
to
be
alone
while
he
was
attempting
to
regain
control
of
his
faculties
more
especially
as
he
noted
that
the
pages
had
placed
their
golden
cups
and
flagons
on
the
marble
table
and
that
his
instinct
assured
him
that
these
precious
vessels
sheltered
no
less
precious
wine
you
may
you
may
he
assented
and
then
as
the
barber
made
to
depart
villon
mood
changed
and
he
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
drew
him
confidentially
toward
him
stay
one
moment
he
murmured
you
know
this
plaguy
memory
of
mine
what
a
forgetful
fellow
i
am
would
you
mind
telling
me
again
who
i
happen
to
be
no
look
of
surprise
stirred
the
barber
face
there
came
no
change
in
his
extreme
complaisance
you
are
the
count
of
montcorbier
monseigneur
he
answered
gravely
you
have
just
arrived
in
paris
from
the
court
of
provence
where
you
stood
in
high
favour
with
the
king
of
that
country
but
your
favour
is
i
believe
greater
with
the
king
of
france
for
he
has
been
pleased
to
make
you
grand
constable
it
is
his
wish
that
you
contrive
to
remember
this
villon
laughed
a
laugh
which
he
tried
hard
to
make
hearty
and
natural
but
with
indifferent
success
of
course
it
was
most
foolish
of
me
to
forget
i
suppose
good
master
that
a
person
in
my
exalted
rank
has
a
good
deal
of
power
influence
authority
and
what
not
with
the
king
favour
you
are
the
first
man
in
the
realm
villon
gave
a
gasp
of
gratification
the
dream
was
growing
in
glory
quite
so
and
does
my
exalted
position
carry
with
it
any
agreeable
perquisite
in
the
way
of
pocket
money
if
you
will
dip
your
finger
in
your
pouch
olivier
suggested
pointing
a
thin
forefinger
at
villon
jewelled
belt
villon
thrust
his
fingers
into
the
pocket
that
hung
from
it
and
brought
them
out
again
loaded
with
great
golden
coins
bright
and
clear
from
the
mint
that
gleamed
joyously
in
the
sunlight
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
as
he
let
them
run
in
a
shining
stream
from
hollowed
hand
to
hollowed
hand
and
contemplated
their
jingle
and
glitter
with
the
delight
of
a
new
midas
but
the
first
thought
that
welled
up
in
his
heart
to
welcome
this
strange
wealth
was
bravely
unselfish
gold
counters
on
my
honour
dear
drops
from
the
divine
stream
of
pactolus
good
sir
will
you
straightway
despatch
some
one
you
can
trust
with
a
handful
of
these
broad
pieces
to
the
church
of
the
celestins
and
inquire
of
the
beadle
there
for
the
dwelling
of
mother
villon
a
poor
old
woman
sorely
plagued
with
a
scapegrace
son
let
him
seek
her
out
she
dwells
in
the
seventh
story
and
therefore
the
nearer
to
the
heaven
she
deserves
and
give
her
these
coins
that
she
may
buy
herself
food
clothes
and
firing
he
was
too
confused
to
reason
clearly
with
his
situation
but
he
felt
sure
that
whoever
he
was
and
wherever
he
was
in
this
amazing
dream
of
his
the
poor
old
woman
whom
he
loved
so
well
must
needs
be
in
it
and
might
benefit
by
this
gift
of
fairy
gold
olivier
bowed
deferentially
it
shall
be
done
he
said
transferring
the
great
gold
discs
to
his
own
pocket
then
pointing
to
a
small
golden
bell
which
one
of
the
pages
had
placed
upon
the
table
he
added
if
there
be
anything
your
dignity
should
desire
he
has
only
to
strike
upon
this
bell
you
are
very
good
villon
responded
solemnly
and
on
the
phrase
olivier
and
the
pages
withdrew
into
the
palace
with
every
sign
of
the
most
profound
respect
the
king
at
his
was
pleased
to
observe
that
his
commands
were
being
obeyed
most
strictly
and
that
no
hint
of
any
secret
mirth
no
obvious
consciousness
of
a
hidden
joke
marred
for
one
moment
the
monumental
gravity
of
the
parts
which
olivier
and
the
pages
had
to
play
as
soon
as
villon
found
himself
alone
he
looked
cautiously
around
him
comprehending
in
his
astonished
glance
the
grey
walls
of
the
palace
the
terrace
the
steps
the
old
stern
tower
with
its
ominous
sun
dial
and
the
wealth
of
wonderful
roses
all
about
him
making
the
air
a
very
paradise
of
exquisite
colours
and
exquisite
odours
he
shut
his
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
opened
them
sharply
as
if
expecting
to
find
that
the
scene
had
vanished
into
thin
impalpable
air
but
castle
and
terrace
tower
and
roses
remained
as
they
had
been
very
plain
to
the
poet
astonished
senses
tiptoeing
cautiously
across
the
grass
he
reached
a
marble
seat
which
stood
beneath
a
bower
of
roses
and
seemed
to
be
protected
by
a
great
terminal
statue
of
the
god
pan
which
had
been
given
as
a
present
to
louis
by
an
eastern
prince
who
had
carried
it
from
athens
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
villon
tried
to
recall
the
events
of
the
evening
before
which
for
some
fantastic
reason
seemed
to
lie
long
centuries
behind
him
he
could
remember
dimly
an
evil
looking
cell
with
straw
upon
the
floor
and
chains
upon
the
walls
he
could
recall
the
sullen
faces
of
unfriendly
gaolers
one
of
these
gaolers
he
remembered
had
thrust
a
mug
of
wine
into
his
hand
and
bade
him
drink
surlily
and
he
had
drunk
greedily
as
was
his
way
when
free
drink
was
offered
to
him
and
drinking
drank
oblivion
sudden
and
complete
but
why
he
had
gone
to
a
dungeon
his
senses
ached
as
he
asked
himself
this
and
faint
pictures
began
to
piece
themselves
together
out
of
the
episodes
of
the
dead
night
he
saw
again
the
squalid
walls
of
the
fircone
tavern
and
his
mind
jumped
back
to
his
recitation
of
the
ballad
and
his
fierce
sense
of
indignation
at
the
humiliation
of
paris
girdled
by
a
wall
of
hostile
burgundians
and
governed
by
an
impotent
king
then
came
the
vision
of
an
visit
and
a
prayer
that
had
more
of
devil
than
angel
in
it
and
then
came
a
quarrel
and
a
fight
in
darkness
shattered
by
the
flaming
torches
of
the
watch
and
thibaut
huge
body
lying
on
the
ground
a
huddled
heap
of
shining
armour
he
remembered
the
ribbon
that
had
been
flung
to
him
from
the
gallery
and
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bosom
of
his
vest
of
cloth
of
gold
and
found
the
token
there
its
glossiness
of
white
and
gold
soiled
by
its
touch
of
the
floor
then
came
his
capture
his
contumelious
march
through
the
gloomy
streets
his
taste
of
an
unknown
prison
his
taste
of
poppied
wine
and
then
sleep
his
next
consciousness
was
that
he
was
lying
on
a
soft
bed
instead
of
on
a
truss
of
straw
and
that
the
darkness
about
him
was
not
the
darkness
of
the
cell
suddenly
someone
drew
a
curtain
and
in
a
second
the
place
where
he
lay
filled
with
a
soft
light
and
showed
that
to
villon
which
astonished
him
as
much
as
if
the
gates
of
paradise
had
parted
before
him
and
shown
him
the
shining
lines
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
he
remembered
that
he
was
lying
in
a
stately
bed
nestled
in
snowy
linen
beneath
a
coverlet
of
crimson
silk
he
remembered
that
the
bed
stood
in
a
gorgeous
room
heavy
with
magnificent
tapestry
and
roofed
with
a
carved
and
painted
ceiling
that
glittered
with
gilt
and
stars
curtains
of
purple
velvet
admitted
the
daylight
through
windows
on
which
rich
armorial
bearings
glowed
in
coloured
glass
soft
and
delicate
odours
impregnated
the
atmosphere
and
tender
strains
of
delicate
music
stole
wooingly
on
the
senses
from
the
strings
of
a
distant
lute
then
there
carne
so
kindly
memory
assured
him
an
obsequious
man
in
black
with
no
less
obsequious
attendants
and
singular
ceremonies
of
bathing
perfuming
and
hair
dressing
and
a
putting
on
of
sweet
linen
and
furred
raiment
and
jewels
and
all
the
ceremonials
for
the
transfiguration
of
a
ragged
robin
into
the
likeness
of
a
mighty
lord
on
the
top
of
all
this
preparation
rose
the
sun
of
a
splendid
banquet
served
in
ware
of
gold
and
silver
and
waited
on
by
the
same
obsequious
figure
in
black
and
the
same
respectful
pages
then
followed
the
summons
to
walk
into
the
air
the
procession
through
quiet
corridors
on
to
the
cool
grey
terrace
and
the
final
installment
in
the
scented
solitude
of
the
rose
garden
villon
was
and
with
the
effort
to
put
so
much
of
the
past
together
he
felt
as
if
in
some
strange
titanic
way
he
had
ruined
a
world
and
was
suddenly
called
upon
by
providence
to
piece
the
fragments
together
and
make
all
whole
again
he
tapped
his
forehead
wonderingly
last
night
i
was
a
outlaw
sleeping
on
the
straw
of
a
dungeon
i
wake
in
a
royal
bed
and
my
varlets
call
me
monseigneur
there
are
but
three
ways
of
explaining
this
singular
situation
either
i
am
drunk
or
i
am
mad
or
i
am
dreaming
if
i
am
drunk
i
shall
never
distinguish
bordeaux
wine
from
burgundy
a
melancholy
dilemma
let
test
it
the
marble
table
stood
but
a
little
way
from
him
the
golden
vessels
that
stood
upon
it
had
served
him
at
that
morning
meal
which
was
still
an
immediate
excellent
memory
and
he
remembered
how
his
attendants
had
told
him
that
one
held
wine
of
bordeaux
and
one
wine
of
burgundy
he
rose
and
crept
across
the
soft
grass
to
the
table
and
lifted
one
of
the
golden
flagons
gingerly
sniffed
at
it
fearfully
and
poured
some
of
its
contents
carefully
into
a
golden
goblet
lifting
it
cautiously
to
his
lips
he
tasted
it
judiciously
a
ripe
warm
royal
flavour
rewarded
him
by
heaven
he
cried
no
nobler
juice
ever
rippled
from
burgundian
vineyards
he
drained
the
cup
and
set
it
down
to
fill
another
from
the
companion
vessel
and
to
repeat
the
ceremony
of
sniffing
tasting
and
swallowing
again
the
desire
of
his
palate
was
pleased
and
pacified
he
reflected
as
he
sipped
and
swallowed
this
quintessence
of
crushed
violets
ripened
no
otherwhere
than
in
the
valleys
of
bordeaux
ergo
i
am
not
drunk
i
do
not
think
i
am
mad
neither
for
i
know
in
my
heart
that
i
am
poor
françois
villon
penniless
master
of
arts
and
no
will
o
the
wisp
grand
constable
then
i
am
dreaming
fast
asleep
in
the
chimney
corner
of
the
fircone
tavern
having
finished
that
flask
i
filched
and
everything
since
then
has
been
and
is
a
dream
the
coming
of
katherine
a
dream
my
fight
with
thibaut
a
dream
then
the
king
popping
up
at
the
last
moment
like
a
a
dream
these
clothes
these
servants
this
garden
dreams
dreams
dreams
i
shall
wake
presently
and
be
devilish
cold
and
devilish
hungry
and
devilish
shabby
but
in
the
meantime
these
dream
liquors
make
good
drinking
he
was
about
to
fill
himself
another
cup
when
a
shadow
fell
at
his
feet
the
shadow
of
olivier
le
dain
standing
before
him
with
his
air
of
emphasized
respect
which
was
beginning
to
pall
upon
the
transfigured
poet
your
dignity
will
forgive
me
but
it
is
the
king
wish
you
should
pass
judgment
on
certain
prisoners
villon
stared
at
him
i
and
here
such
is
the
king
pleasure
what
prisoners
certain
rogues
and
vagabonds
mankind
and
womankind
taken
brawling
in
the
fircone
tavern
last
night
villon
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
an
idea
seemed
to
take
command
of
his
confused
mind
here
was
a
chance
to
learn
something
of
the
reality
that
lay
at
the
core
of
all
this
mystery
of
roses
and
wine
and
fine
raiment
he
leaned
forward
curiously
and
almost
whispered
to
the
attendant
barber
tell
me
is
master
françois
villon
master
of
arts
rhymer
at
his
best
vagabond
at
his
worst
at
all
seasons
and
scapegrace
in
all
moods
among
them
olivier
smiled
complacently
as
those
in
office
are
accustomed
to
smile
at
the
humours
of
great
men
your
dignity
is
pleased
to
jest
shall
i
send
you
the
prisoners
villon
caught
at
the
offer
sharply
can
i
do
with
them
as
i
wish
absolutely
as
you
wish
such
is
the
king
will
villon
leaned
back
in
resigned
surrender
to
an
astonishing
situation
he
had
dreamed
strange
dreams
in
his
days
and
nights
but
never
a
dream
like
this
dream
set
a
thief
to
try
a
thief
he
philosophized
well
bring
them
in
olivier
bowed
and
disappeared
silently
along
the
rose
alley
by
which
he
had
come
when
he
was
alone
again
villon
slapped
his
forehead
resoundingly
as
if
he
hoped
to
scare
his
senses
back
into
sanity
by
violent
assault
oh
my
poor
head
he
moaned
am
i
awake
am
i
asleep
what
an
embroglio
a
sense
of
dislike
to
his
respectful
attendant
surged
up
through
his
perplexity
that
damned
fellow
in
black
is
confoundedly
obsequious
he
muttered
i
wonder
if
i
could
order
him
to
be
hanged
he
has
a
hanging
face
even
as
this
kind
reflection
came
into
his
head
his
meditations
were
disturbed
by
the
tramp
of
many
feet
and
the
rattle
and
clank
of
weapons
and
a
small
company
of
soldiers
came
wheeling
round
into
the
rose
garden
from
the
side
of
the
palace
guarding
a
number
of
men
and
women
in
whom
villon
instantly
recognized
his
familiar
friends
of
the
fircone
tavern
at
the
head
of
the
soldiers
marched
a
dapper
gentleman
or
a
thing
of
silk
and
steel
half
dandy
half
exquisitely
attired
and
flagrantly
aware
of
his
own
attractions
he
too
was
familiar
to
the
poet
for
he
was
no
other
than
the
pink
and
white
gentleman
whom
he
had
seen
acting
as
escort
to
katherine
on
the
day
when
he
first
beheld
her
and
whose
name
as
he
had
learned
on
the
previous
evening
from
katherine
own
lips
was
noel
le
jolys
the
puppet
who
dangles
after
my
lady
he
grumbled
to
himself
he
jars
the
dream
villon
felt
profoundly
sorry
for
his
imprisoned
playfellows
and
profoundly
hostile
to
the
pink
and
white
gentleman
his
friends
looked
so
wretched
so
woebegone
so
bedraggled
while
their
captor
looked
so
and
that
villon
felt
a
fierce
indignation
burn
within
him
over
the
injustices
of
the
world
how
my
poor
devils
look
and
how
dirty
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
soldiers
ranged
their
prisoners
in
a
line
before
him
at
the
base
of
the
terrace
and
their
prinked
and
fragrant
captain
came
trippingly
forward
and
saluted
villon
presenting
to
him
at
the
same
time
a
piece
of
paper
covered
with
writing
my
lord
he
said
dapperly
here
are
the
names
of
these
night
birds
villon
took
the
paper
and
looked
straightly
into
the
young
eyes
have
we
ever
met
before
he
asked
noel
le
jolys
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
alas
no
he
said
your
lordship
has
swept
into
court
like
an
unheralded
comet
you
shall
tell
us
tales
of
provence
to
please
our
ladies
still
gravely
looking
at
him
villon
questioned
him
again
messire
noel
if
you
and
i
had
a
mind
to
pluck
the
same
rose
from
this
garden
which
of
us
would
win
the
affable
fribble
intelligence
appeared
to
be
baffled
i
do
not
understand
you
he
protested
villon
shrugged
his
shoulders
never
mind
he
said
seating
himself
again
on
the
marble
seat
and
looking
at
the
familiar
names
on
the
piece
of
paper
send
me
hither
rené
de
montigny
he
was
fairly
convinced
by
this
time
that
he
was
not
wandering
in
the
labyrinths
of
a
dream
that
he
really
was
awake
but
that
for
some
reason
which
he
was
unable
to
fathom
he
had
been
thus
strangely
transmuted
into
the
semblance
of
splendour
and
authority
the
popinjay
fails
to
recognize
me
he
said
to
himself
so
may
my
bullies
and
as
he
thought
rené
de
montigny
was
pushed
forward
by
a
couple
of
soldiers
and
stood
sullenly
defiant
before
him
villon
leaned
forward
oddly
interested
in
the
grotesque
turn
of
things
which
put
him
in
this
position
with
his
old
companion
and
you
are
he
questioned
montigny
answered
angrily
rené
de
montigny
of
gentle
blood
fallen
on
ungentle
days
through
no
fault
of
your
own
of
course
as
your
grace
surmises
through
no
fault
of
my
own
i
am
poor
but
i
thank
my
stars
i
am
honest
this
remark
which
was
made
aloud
for
the
benefit
of
all
and
sundry
provoked
a
roar
of
laughter
from
guy
tabarie
which
was
promptly
converted
into
a
groan
as
an
indignant
soldier
smote
him
into
silence
by
a
lusty
blow
on
the
back
villon
caught
him
up
on
the
assertion
since
when
sir
since
last
night
i
do
not
understand
your
grace
when
jason
was
a
farmer
in
colchis
he
sowed
dragons
teeth
and
reaped
soldiers
what
do
you
grow
in
your
garden
sire
de
montigny
montigny
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
but
his
answer
came
prompt
cabbages
villon
shook
his
head
arrows
master
rené
burgundian
arrows
most
condemnable
vegetables
have
a
care
is
a
pestilent
crop
and
may
poison
the
gardener
stand
aside
rené
de
montigny
stared
at
his
interlocutor
in
a
paroxysm
of
amazement
here
was
his
dearest
secret
loose
on
the
lips
of
his
questioner
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ventured
boldly
to
gaze
into
the
face
of
authority
and
villon
returned
his
gaze
defiantly
but
there
was
no
recognition
in
montigny
eyes
he
could
see
nothing
in
common
between
the
splendid
gentleman
who
now
addressed
him
and
the
ragged
rhymester
who
shared
so
many
squalid
adventures
with
him
and
in
an
instant
he
averted
his
head
respectfully
if
your
grace
will
deign
he
pleaded
stretching
out
his
hands
in
entreaty
but
villon
was
inexorable
stand
aside
he
repeated
and
montigny
protesting
was
dragged
back
to
his
place
with
his
fellows
while
villon
read
the
name
of
the
next
rogue
on
the
list
which
happened
to
be
that
of
guy
tabarie
by
this
time
villon
spirit
had
entered
into
a
very
complete
appreciation
of
the
humours
of
the
situation
having
realized
that
his
identity
was
safe
even
from
the
keen
eyes
of
rené
de
montigny
he
felt
assured
that
he
might
defy
the
indifferent
scrutiny
of
his
less
alert
companions
and
though
he
made
use
of
the
long
pendant
fold
of
his
cap
to
conceal
in
some
measure
his
countenance
he
was
now
so
confident
of
his
safety
that
he
was
prepared
to
greet
each
prisoner
with
composure
guy
tabarie
cut
a
piteous
figure
as
he
tottered
across
the
grass
rudely
propelled
by
the
violence
of
the
soldier
who
escorted
him
tweaking
him
by
the
ear
and
fell
a
quaking
mountain
of
flesh
at
the
feet
of
the
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
grand
constable
of
france
with
piteous
gesticulations
and
trembling
fingers
the
red
gross
man
knelt
and
attempted
to
plead
for
mercy
villon
eyed
him
sternly
though
he
found
it
hard
to
restrain
his
laughter
you
come
with
clean
hands
he
asked
and
guy
answered
babbling
his
words
tumbling
from
him
incoherent
and
confused
holding
out
his
huge
paws
like
a
schoolboy
reproved
for
want
of
soap
and
water
as
decent
a
lad
my
lord
as
ever
kept
body
and
soul
together
by
walking
on
the
straight
and
narrow
path
that
leads
to
he
had
stuttered
thus
far
when
villon
interrupted
him
the
gallows
master
tabarie
guy
bulk
quivered
in
piteous
negation
no
no
i
have
the
fear
of
god
in
me
as
strong
as
any
man
in
paris
villon
leaned
over
a
little
nearer
to
his
victim
and
breathed
a
question
into
his
ear
do
you
know
the
church
of
maturin
master
tabarie
the
little
eyes
of
tabarie
widened
in
surprise
and
he
stammered
a
no
my
lord
that
was
in
itself
a
flagrant
confession
of
shameful
knowledge
villon
wagged
his
head
wisely
master
tabarie
master
tabarie
your
memory
is
failing
you
why
no
later
than
the
middle
of
march
last
you
broke
into
the
church
at
dead
of
night
and
pilfered
the
gold
plate
from
the
altar
the
fear
of
god
is
not
very
strong
in
you
if
master
tabarie
had
been
listening
to
the
words
of
a
wizard
he
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
saints
and
angels
he
cried
aloud
this
grand
constable
is
the
devil
himself
my
lord
i
was
led
astray
my
lord
i
was
not
alone
villon
had
had
enough
entertainment
from
his
fat
companion
he
made
a
sign
and
instantly
a
soldier
swooped
upon
the
grovelling
figure
twitched
him
to
his
feet
and
drew
him
apart
stuttering
furious
protestations
of
innocence
villon
looked
at
the
list
in
his
hand
and
this
time
he
called
for
two
names
colin
de
cayeulx
and
casin
cholet
and
as
he
spoke
the
two
knaves
were
pushed
forward
towards
him
villon
drew
the
pair
a
little
way
apart
and
stood
between
them
eyeing
their
roguish
faces
on
which
false
affability
struggled
with
a
very
real
fear
are
you
good
citizens
sirs
he
asked
and
colin
immediately
answered
him
i
am
loath
to
sing
my
own
praises
but
i
can
speak
frankly
for
my
friend
here
the
king
has
no
better
subject
and
paris
no
more
peaceable
burgess
than
casin
cholet
as
he
spoke
he
waved
casin
cholet
a
warm
salutation
and
cholet
responded
to
his
praises
with
a
friendly
grin
and
yet
more
friendly
words
if
i
have
any
poor
merits
i
owe
them
all
to
this
good
example
i
have
followed
his
lead
halting
and
humble
your
eye
on
colin
de
cayeulx
i
have
ever
said
to
myself
learn
how
a
good
man
lives
the
two
men
leered
at
each
other
across
villon
hoping
that
their
praises
of
each
other
might
have
due
effect
upon
the
great
lord
who
seemed
so
condescending
to
them
villon
smiled
you
are
the
castor
and
pollux
of
purity
do
you
remember
the
night
of
last
shrove
tuesday
and
the
girl
you
carried
off
to
fat
and
held
to
ransom
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
the
two
men
was
startling
the
ugly
episode
loomed
up
in
their
memories
and
they
shivered
to
find
it
known
in
a
second
the
simulated
friendship
of
bandit
for
bandit
vanished
and
the
two
men
glared
at
each
other
with
the
ferocity
of
fighting
dogs
as
they
hurled
accusation
and
denial
at
each
other
that
was
colin
adventure
that
was
casin
enterprise
i
deplored
it
i
had
no
hand
in
it
forgetting
their
respect
for
authority
in
the
fury
of
their
antagonism
they
struck
angrily
at
each
other
across
their
questioner
and
were
for
grappling
in
close
combat
when
villon
made
a
signal
and
they
in
their
turn
were
dragged
back
raging
into
the
ranks
of
their
fellow
prisoners
there
was
only
one
left
now
jehan
le
loup
who
stood
with
folded
arms
and
lowering
brows
surveying
the
efforts
of
his
made
a
sign
and
the
man
was
dragged
into
his
presence
villon
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
you
seem
a
brisk
assured
fellow
for
a
man
in
duress
the
friendly
demeanour
of
the
great
man
cheered
the
prisoner
and
he
answered
bluffly
my
good
conscience
sustains
me
villon
demeanour
was
still
amicable
as
he
put
his
next
question
in
a
voice
that
came
only
to
jeban
ears
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
how
did
thevenin
pensete
come
to
his
death
the
muscles
of
jehan
le
loup
face
twitched
for
a
moment
but
he
clinched
his
fingers
tightly
to
restrain
himself
and
answered
with
a
surly
impassability
how
should
i
know
my
lord
villon
drew
him
nearer
and
spoke
lower
still
who
better
that
nasty
quarrel
over
the
cards
the
high
words
and
a
snatch
for
the
winnings
a
tilted
table
an
extinguished
taper
a
stab
in
the
dark
and
a
groan
exit
thevenin
pensete
your
dagger
does
grow
rusty
jehan
grey
face
grew
greyer
and
uglier
but
he
kept
his
countenance
monseigneur
he
answered
i
loved
him
like
a
brother
as
cain
loved
abel
villon
said
he
made
a
sign
and
jehan
le
loup
was
taken
back
to
his
fellows
so
far
villon
had
been
sufficiently
diverted
he
had
played
upon
the
terrors
of
his
friends
he
had
bewildered
them
to
the
top
of
his
desire
he
now
foresaw
the
possibility
of
sport
more
delicate
as
his
glance
fell
upon
the
group
of
girls
who
clustered
together
like
frightened
birds
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
of
pan
he
made
a
sign
to
messire
noel
and
the
gilded
exquisite
drew
near
bring
me
hither
those
four
gentlewomen
he
commanded
the
fop
face
lengthened
with
amazed
disapprobation
gentlewomen
messire
those
four
doxies
villon
reproved
him
they
are
women
good
captain
and
you
and
i
are
gentlemen
or
should
be
and
must
use
them
gently
messire
noel
frowned
and
his
hand
made
a
gesture
in
the
direction
of
his
then
he
remembered
the
folly
of
quarrelling
with
so
great
a
man
and
contented
himself
with
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
he
questioned
and
the
demirep
in
the
doublet
and
hose
let
her
stay
for
the
present
villon
answered
and
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
noel
the
four
girls
came
timidly
forward
with
downcast
eyes
while
huguette
remained
apart
leaning
composedly
against
the
image
of
pan
and
surveying
the
scene
with
a
indifference
when
the
girls
were
close
to
him
villon
spoke
well
young
ladies
what
is
this
trade
of
yours
that
has
brought
you
into
trouble
jehanneton
dropped
a
curtsey
i
make
the
caps
that
line
helmets
isabeau
followed
quickly
i
am
a
lace
weaver
enne
an
honest
trade
blanche
came
next
i
am
a
slipper
maker
denise
ended
the
catalogue
and
i
a
glover
mischief
danced
in
villon
eyes
no
worse
and
no
better
a
word
in
your
ear
he
whispered
something
into
each
girl
ear
in
turn
and
as
he
did
so
each
girl
started
drew
back
looked
confused
laughed
and
blushed
it
is
ever
to
be
deplored
that
the
worthy
dom
gregory
whose
ecclesiastical
history
of
poitou
is
the
source
of
so
much
curious
information
concerning
villon
should
have
omitted
from
a
mistaken
sense
of
delicacy
to
chronicle
precisely
what
it
was
that
the
poet
whispered
in
the
ears
of
each
of
the
girls
all
he
condescends
to
record
in
his
crabbed
canine
latin
is
that
villon
showed
such
intimate
acquaintance
with
certain
physical
peculiarities
or
whimsical
adventures
private
to
each
damsel
that
she
believed
the
speaker
knowledge
to
be
little
less
than
supernatural
literature
of
the
skittish
sort
must
deplore
the
monastic
reticence
but
history
can
do
no
more
than
accept
it
and
leave
imagination
to
fill
in
the
blank
as
best
it
pleases
all
history
is
certain
of
is
that
the
girls
gathered
together
chatting
like
sparrows
each
speaking
rapidly
the
gentleman
is
a
wizard
why
he
told
me
enne
a
miracle
he
reminded
me
why
he
knows
what
do
you
think
he
said
each
girl
was
whispering
to
the
other
what
villon
had
told
her
when
villon
interrupted
them
young
women
young
women
the
world
is
a
devil
of
a
place
for
those
who
are
poor
i
could
preach
you
a
powerful
sermon
on
your
follies
and
frailties
but
somehow
the
words
stick
in
my
gullet
here
is
a
gold
coin
apiece
for
you
go
and
gather
yourself
roses
my
roses
to
take
back
to
what
heaven
pity
you
you
call
your
homes
jehanneton
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprise
are
we
free
villon
answered
her
sadly
free
poor
children
such
as
you
are
never
free
go
and
pray
heaven
to
make
men
better
for
the
sake
of
your
daughter
daughters
his
extended
hands
were
full
of
gold
pieces
but
they
were
soon
emptied
by
the
eager
girls
who
pounced
upon
them
then
they
left
him
with
many
curtsies
and
salutations
and
drifted
away
delightedly
into
the
mazes
of
the
rose
garden
villon
turned
to
look
at
the
men
prisoners
who
were
anxiously
scanning
his
actions
as
for
these
gentlemen
he
said
to
noel
let
them
go
where
they
will
but
first
give
them
food
and
drink
and
a
pocketful
of
money
the
effect
of
his
words
was
almost
as
paralyzing
upon
the
rogues
as
it
was
upon
messire
noel
it
pleased
the
one
as
much
as
it
displeased
the
other
noel
looked
the
contempt
he
did
not
venture
to
express
the
men
rushed
forward
choking
with
gratitude
god
save
you
sir
your
excellency
is
of
a
most
excellent
excellence
long
live
the
grand
constable
a
most
rare
constable
villon
waved
them
away
go
your
ways
he
said
and
if
you
can
mend
them
shouting
and
dancing
for
joy
the
men
took
advantage
of
his
permission
and
disappeared
in
their
turn
among
the
alleys
of
the
rose
garden
seeking
and
finding
the
wandering
women
and
vanishing
with
them
in
due
course
into
the
labyrinths
of
paris
villon
turned
to
noel
you
may
dismiss
your
soldiers
he
said
attend
me
within
call
and
as
noel
obeyed
him
he
advanced
to
where
huguette
was
standing
with
a
smile
of
scornful
indifference
still
on
her
fair
face
villon
asked
himself
as
he
went
why
in
god
name
does
the
world
appear
so
is
it
the
thing
they
call
the
better
self
or
merely
this
purple
and
fine
linen
what
he
said
when
he
came
to
the
girl
was
fair
mistress
you
have
a
comely
face
and
you
make
it
very
plain
that
you
have
a
comely
figure
why
do
you
go
thus
the
girl
shrugged
her
green
shoulders
and
shifted
the
balance
of
her
body
from
one
green
leg
to
the
other
as
she
answered
impudently
for
ease
and
freedom
to
please
myself
and
to
show
my
fine
shape
to
please
others
last
night
this
girl
had
been
his
own
familiar
friend
she
lay
leagues
away
from
his
fairy
greatness
there
was
pity
in
his
next
speech
are
you
a
happy
woman
mistress
happy
enough
she
answered
as
she
snapped
her
fingers
defiantly
when
fools
like
you
do
clap
me
into
prison
for
living
my
life
in
my
own
way
i
may
be
a
fool
but
i
did
not
clap
you
into
prison
heaven
forbid
a
curious
look
came
into
the
girl
eyes
and
she
drew
a
little
nearer
to
him
her
voice
was
a
caress
the
tenor
of
her
hands
was
a
caress
every
supple
curve
of
her
alluring
body
caressed
she
seemed
to
coax
him
as
she
whispered
your
voice
sounds
familiar
monseigneur
had
i
ever
the
honour
to
serve
you
villon
drew
away
from
her
he
felt
suddenly
and
sorry
for
the
woman
sorry
for
himself
who
knows
he
answered
the
girl
laughed
and
turned
aside
who
cares
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
set
you
free
my
delicate
bird
of
prey
those
wild
wings
were
never
meant
for
clipping
and
caging
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
please
you
on
the
instant
her
enticement
shifted
all
her
being
was
a
tremulous
entreaty
what
has
come
to
master
françois
villon
why
do
you
ask
he
was
with
us
when
we
were
snared
last
night
but
he
did
not
share
our
prison
and
he
is
not
with
us
now
does
he
live
villon
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
speaking
he
lives
he
is
banished
from
paris
but
he
lives
huguette
clasped
her
hands
in
gratitude
the
sweet
saints
be
thanked
she
said
and
there
was
that
in
her
voice
which
made
the
simple
words
sound
very
sincere
to
ears
what
do
you
care
for
the
fate
of
this
fellow
as
i
am
a
fool
i
believe
i
love
him
heaven
mercy
why
i
can
not
tell
you
messire
a
look
in
his
eyes
a
trick
of
his
voice
the
something
the
nothing
that
makes
a
woman
heart
run
like
wax
in
the
fire
he
never
made
woman
happy
yet
and
i
swear
no
woman
ever
made
him
happy
if
you
gave
him
the
moon
he
would
want
the
stars
for
a
garnish
he
believes
nothing
he
laughs
at
everything
he
is
a
false
monkey
and
yet
i
wish
i
had
borne
such
a
child
there
was
a
sudden
pain
at
villon
heart
as
if
the
girl
fingers
had
seized
it
and
squeezed
it
but
he
replied
lightly
let
us
speak
no
more
of
this
rascal
he
believes
more
and
laughs
less
than
he
did
he
is
so
glad
to
be
alive
that
his
forehead
scrapes
the
sky
and
the
stars
fall
at
his
feet
in
gold
dust
paris
is
well
rid
of
such
a
jackanapes
you
are
a
merry
gentleman
i
would
be
more
gentle
than
merry
with
you
will
you
wear
this
ring
for
my
sake
fancy
that
it
comes
from
master
françois
villon
who
will
always
think
kindly
of
your
wild
eyes
let
me
see
your
face
she
requested
but
villon
denied
her
he
signed
to
noel
le
jolys
where
he
stood
apart
and
the
young
soldier
came
hurriedly
to
him
captain
he
said
give
this
lady
honourable
conduct
he
moved
away
and
left
the
pair
together
the
mannish
woman
and
the
womanish
man
looking
at
each
other
the
man
in
admiration
and
the
woman
in
veiled
disdain
you
are
a
comely
girl
noel
affirmed
roundly
huguette
laughed
this
is
news
from
land
noel
spoke
lower
where
do
you
lodge
huguette
was
a
woman
of
business
in
an
instant
she
flashed
in
noel
face
the
ring
the
grand
constable
had
given
her
as
she
answered
at
the
sign
of
the
golden
scull
hard
by
the
fircone
will
you
visit
me
noel
clapped
his
hands
together
as
i
am
a
man
i
will
a
good
understanding
being
thus
established
the
pair
drifted
away
together
and
were
soon
lost
to
sight
villon
looking
after
them
mused
heaven
forgive
me
i
am
becoming
a
most
pitiful
loud
preacher
every
rogue
there
deserves
the
gallows
but
so
do
i
no
less
and
i
have
not
swallowed
enough
of
this
court
air
to
make
me
a
hypocrite
well
all
this
justice
is
thirsty
work
and
mad
or
sane
sleeping
or
waking
let
me
drink
while
i
can
he
returned
to
the
golden
flagons
poured
out
a
full
cup
of
burgundy
watched
it
glow
in
the
sunlight
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
to
the
loveliest
lady
this
side
of
heaven
he
said
for
a
toast
but
ere
he
touched
his
lips
to
the
cup
he
lowered
it
again
olivier
le
dain
had
come
on
to
the
terrace
and
with
olivier
there
came
a
lady
by
heaven
villon
cried
my
eyes
dazzle
for
i
believe
i
see
her
chapter
vi
garden
love
on
the
terrace
the
fair
girl
leaned
and
looked
over
at
the
garden
and
its
golden
occupant
to
the
eyes
of
villon
her
beauty
had
never
seemed
rarer
and
the
wild
passion
which
had
prompted
him
to
spin
his
very
soul
into
song
burnt
with
a
new
delicious
strength
of
hope
he
stared
at
her
as
a
worshipper
might
stare
at
some
sudden
vision
of
a
long
dreamed
of
goddess
and
as
he
stared
olivier
descended
the
steps
and
came
and
stood
before
him
my
lord
there
is
a
lady
there
who
desires
to
speak
with
you
villon
turned
his
gaze
unwillingly
from
the
gracious
apparition
above
him
to
the
sombre
servitor
i
desire
to
speak
with
her
he
said
earnestly
and
again
his
eyes
travelled
in
the
direction
of
the
lady
olivier
came
close
to
him
and
touched
him
respectfully
on
the
wrist
remember
my
lord
he
said
very
softly
that
you
are
françois
of
corbeuil
lord
of
montcorbier
grand
constable
of
france
newly
come
to
paris
from
the
court
of
his
majesty
of
provence
remember
this
as
if
it
were
written
in
letters
of
gold
upon
tables
of
iron
forget
all
else
the
king
commands
it
the
words
sounded
dully
enough
on
villon
brain
absorbed
as
he
was
in
the
contemplation
of
his
queen
but
at
least
they
served
to
convince
him
of
what
he
had
already
begun
to
assure
himself
that
for
some
purpose
or
other
king
louis
wished
him
well
and
granted
him
golden
chances
françois
of
corbeuil
count
of
montcorbier
stood
in
a
very
different
relation
to
the
lady
katherine
from
that
of
the
lowly
poet
and
gaolbird
who
had
rhymed
and
sighed
and
battled
in
the
fircone
tavern
last
night
the
king
shall
be
obeyed
he
said
gravely
and
olivier
turning
made
a
sign
to
katherine
who
descended
the
steps
slowly
as
she
reached
the
last
step
olivier
saluted
villon
and
the
lady
profoundly
and
mounting
the
steps
vanished
within
the
palace
the
man
and
the
woman
were
left
alone
in
the
rose
garden
villon
felt
a
sudden
strange
sensation
at
his
heart
exquisite
pain
and
exquisite
pleasure
and
he
clasped
his
hands
together
i
am
awake
he
assured
himself
no
dream
could
be
as
fair
as
she
even
at
the
thought
katherine
flung
herself
swiftly
at
his
feet
divinely
gracious
in
her
surrender
of
dignity
as
she
kneeled
to
him
with
uplifted
imploring
hands
and
eyes
my
lord
she
cried
will
you
listen
to
a
distressed
lady
villon
stooped
and
caught
her
white
fingers
and
drew
her
to
her
feet
not
while
the
lady
kneels
he
said
gently
and
he
looked
with
a
strange
apprehension
into
the
frank
bright
eyes
of
katherine
would
she
know
him
for
what
he
was
he
wondered
he
read
no
recognition
in
her
sweet
eyes
katherine
returned
his
gaze
unflinchingly
regarding
him
as
a
great
lady
might
regard
some
stranger
her
equal
of
whom
she
could
ask
a
favour
she
does
not
know
me
villon
delight
cried
in
his
heart
and
at
the
thought
his
spirit
fluttered
with
fierce
exaltation
the
lord
of
moncorbier
who
was
grand
constable
of
france
might
say
many
things
that
were
denied
to
the
lips
of
françois
villon
katherine
pleaded
warmly
there
is
a
man
in
prison
at
this
hour
for
whom
i
would
implore
your
clemency
his
name
is
françois
villon
last
night
he
wounded
thibaut
villon
smiled
a
contented
smile
thereby
making
room
for
me
he
suggested
katherine
went
on
unheeding
the
penalty
is
death
but
thibaut
was
a
traitor
sold
to
burgundy
did
this
villon
fight
him
for
his
treason
no
he
fought
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
he
risked
his
life
with
a
light
heart
because
a
woman
asked
him
how
do
you
know
all
this
because
i
was
the
woman
this
man
had
seen
me
thought
he
loved
me
sent
me
verses
how
insolent
it
was
insolence
and
yet
they
were
beautiful
verses
i
was
in
mortal
fear
of
thibaut
i
went
to
this
villon
and
begged
him
to
kill
my
enemy
he
backed
his
love
tale
with
his
sword
and
he
lies
in
the
shadow
of
death
it
is
not
just
that
he
should
suffer
for
my
sin
villon
turned
suddenly
upon
the
beautiful
suppliant
a
thought
had
come
into
his
brain
so
whimsical
and
so
fantastic
that
it
made
him
as
dizzy
for
an
instant
as
if
the
smooth
grass
beneath
him
had
yawned
into
a
sheer
and
evil
precipice
do
you
by
any
chance
love
this
villon
a
little
wave
of
disdain
rippled
over
the
girl
calm
face
great
ladies
do
not
love
tavern
bravos
but
i
pity
him
and
i
do
not
want
him
to
die
though
indeed
life
can
not
be
very
dear
to
him
if
he
would
fling
it
away
to
please
a
woman
she
had
held
a
rose
in
her
hand
and
as
she
spoke
she
flung
it
from
her
in
dainty
symbolism
of
the
life
which
the
poor
tavern
poet
had
risked
so
bravely
for
her
sake
a
mad
resolve
came
into
mind
if
he
was
indeed
all
that
this
woman
thought
him
to
be
all
that
those
with
whom
he
had
spoken
had
assured
him
he
was
now
was
his
chance
to
play
the
lover
to
his
heart
desire
if
the
grand
constable
had
the
power
to
pardon
surely
the
grand
constable
had
also
the
right
to
woo
she
had
drawn
a
little
way
from
him
and
he
followed
her
up
standing
so
close
to
her
that
with
a
little
movement
he
might
have
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
even
when
you
are
the
woman
if
i
had
stood
in
this
rascal
shoes
i
would
have
done
as
he
did
for
your
sake
the
girl
gave
a
joyous
cry
if
you
think
this
you
should
grant
the
poor
knave
his
freedom
villon
flung
his
hands
apart
with
a
magnificent
gesture
of
liberation
that
broker
of
ballads
shall
go
free
your
prayer
unshackles
him
and
we
will
do
no
more
than
banish
him
from
paris
forget
that
such
a
slave
ever
came
near
you
the
lady
dropped
him
a
magnificent
curtsey
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
gratitude
i
shall
remember
your
clemency
she
made
as
if
she
would
leave
his
presence
but
his
boldness
waxed
within
him
as
a
fire
waxes
with
new
wood
and
he
caught
her
lightly
by
the
wrist
by
saint
venus
i
envy
this
fellow
that
he
should
have
won
your
thoughts
for
i
am
in
his
case
and
i
too
would
die
to
serve
you
surprise
flamed
in
the
girl
eyes
surprise
and
amusement
mingled
my
lord
you
do
not
know
me
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
was
as
fresh
and
merry
as
a
milkmaid
in
the
meadows
did
he
know
you
yet
when
he
saw
you
he
loved
you
and
made
bold
to
tell
you
so
her
forehead
wrinkled
prettily
in
a
little
protesting
frown
his
words
were
of
no
more
account
than
the
wind
in
the
eaves
but
you
and
i
are
peers
and
the
words
we
change
have
meanings
villon
caught
his
breath
the
lord
of
montcorbier
was
indeed
wardered
by
very
different
stars
from
the
fellow
of
the
fircone
he
saluted
her
banteringly
though
i
be
newly
come
to
paris
i
have
heard
much
of
the
beauty
and
more
of
the
pride
of
the
lady
katherine
de
vaucelles
a
little
fire
burned
in
the
girl
pale
cheeks
and
she
flung
her
head
back
scornfully
i
am
humble
enough
as
to
my
beauty
but
i
am
very
proud
of
my
pride
villon
leaning
forward
with
entreating
hands
pleaded
with
beseeching
lips
would
you
pity
me
if
i
told
you
that
i
loved
you
katherine
laughed
and
the
music
of
her
laughter
seemed
to
wake
faint
echoes
among
the
roses
as
if
every
blossom
were
a
magic
bell
with
a
fairy
hand
at
the
clapper
heaven
mercy
she
said
how
fast
your
fancy
gallops
i
care
little
to
be
flattered
and
less
to
be
wooed
and
i
swear
that
i
should
be
very
hard
to
win
she
turned
to
mount
the
steps
as
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
said
all
that
she
wanted
to
say
but
villon
delayed
her
with
imploring
protest
i
have
more
right
to
try
than
your
taproom
bandit
i
see
what
he
saw
i
love
what
he
loved
again
the
girl
laughter
brightened
the
summer
air
you
are
very
inflammable
villon
caught
at
her
words
my
fire
burns
to
the
ashes
you
can
no
more
stay
me
from
loving
you
than
you
can
stay
the
flowers
from
loving
the
soft
air
or
true
men
from
loving
honour
or
heroes
from
loving
glory
i
would
rake
the
moon
from
heaven
for
you
the
girl
swayed
her
head
daintily
as
a
queen
rose
might
in
a
realm
of
roses
there
was
something
like
pity
in
her
eyes
but
laughter
lingered
on
her
lips
that
promise
has
grown
rusty
since
adam
first
made
it
to
eve
she
eyed
him
in
silence
for
a
second
time
deriding
his
sighs
with
a
smile
then
there
is
a
rhyme
in
my
mind
she
cried
about
moons
and
lovers
and
she
began
to
declaim
half
muse
half
minx
some
lines
that
had
pleased
her
to
tease
the
importunate
stranger
life
is
unstable
love
may
uphold
fear
goes
in
sable
courage
in
gold
mystery
covers
midnight
and
noon
heroes
and
lovers
cry
for
the
moon
as
the
first
words
of
the
verse
fell
from
her
lips
villon
heart
leaped
and
his
eyes
brightened
for
he
knew
the
sound
they
were
part
of
the
rhymes
himself
had
sent
her
on
that
very
parchment
which
had
cost
him
first
a
dinner
and
then
a
drubbing
he
had
fancied
the
words
and
the
rhymes
when
he
wrote
them
but
now
they
seemed
to
sound
on
his
ears
with
the
married
music
of
all
the
falling
waters
and
all
the
blowing
winds
of
the
world
it
was
a
shining
face
that
he
turned
to
the
girl
as
he
jeered
denying
the
thought
in
his
heart
what
doggerel
the
girl
flashed
scorn
at
him
doggerel
it
is
divinity
she
insisted
flinging
a
kiss
from
her
in
godspeed
as
it
were
to
the
banished
as
she
moved
a
little
further
up
the
steps
villon
followed
her
let
come
what
might
come
he
was
the
maid
equal
for
the
moment
and
would
press
his
suit
if
he
died
for
it
tell
me
what
i
may
do
he
said
to
win
your
favour
the
girl
smiling
face
grew
graver
as
she
looked
down
on
the
imploring
poet
a
trifle
she
said
lightly
as
a
child
might
bid
for
a
doll
and
then
as
villon
eyes
glowed
questions
her
voice
rang
out
like
the
call
of
a
clarion
save
france
she
trumpeted
villon
caught
fire
from
both
her
moods
no
more
he
said
and
though
the
sound
of
his
voice
jested
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
earnest
the
girl
responded
to
jest
and
earnest
royally
no
less
are
you
not
grand
constable
chief
of
the
king
army
there
is
an
enemy
at
the
gates
of
paris
and
none
of
the
king
men
can
frighten
him
away
she
pointed
out
where
in
the
distance
beyond
the
walls
of
paris
the
pitched
tents
of
the
enemy
fluttered
their
hostile
flags
her
bosom
heaved
with
great
desire
oh
that
a
man
would
come
to
court
for
the
man
who
shall
trail
the
banners
of
burgundy
in
the
dust
for
the
king
of
france
to
walk
on
i
may
perhaps
have
favours
villon
looked
at
her
as
men
must
have
looked
at
joan
of
arc
when
she
bade
them
rise
up
and
strike
for
france
you
are
hard
to
please
he
said
but
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
at
the
thought
of
trying
to
please
her
if
he
could
do
this
thing
the
girl
answered
his
words
and
not
his
thoughts
my
hero
must
have
every
virtue
for
his
wreath
every
courage
for
his
coronet
farewell
by
this
time
she
had
reached
the
terrace
and
she
made
to
enter
the
palace
villon
called
to
her
longingly
stay
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
you
the
girl
smiled
denial
i
have
but
one
she
said
and
i
have
said
it
long
since
farewell
villon
made
a
dash
for
audacity
i
will
follow
you
he
said
and
he
moved
to
do
so
but
the
lifted
finger
stayed
him
you
may
not
she
said
peremptorily
i
go
to
the
queen
and
so
with
a
swift
salutation
gracious
as
the
dip
of
a
dancing
wave
she
entered
the
palace
and
left
him
standing
there
dazed
and
ardent
as
a
man
might
be
who
had
just
been
vouchsafed
the
vision
of
an
angel
he
murmured
to
himself
her
words
as
he
slowly
descended
the
steps
to
the
ground
oh
that
a
man
would
come
to
court
and
on
that
text
he
wove
the
hopeful
commentary
of
his
thoughts
why
should
i
not
deserve
her
last
night
i
was
only
a
poor
devil
with
a
rusty
sword
and
a
single
suit
all
different
i
am
the
king
friend
it
would
seem
a
court
potentate
a
man
of
mark
what
may
i
not
accomplish
this
finery
smiles
like
sunlight
and
the
world
will
warm
its
hands
at
me
he
was
exquisitely
pleased
with
himself
exquisitely
pleased
with
the
world
that
held
him
and
katherine
he
forgot
as
lovers
always
will
forget
that
there
was
any
one
else
in
the
world
save
himself
and
his
beloved
and
he
was
so
wrapped
in
his
sweet
contemplations
that
he
did
not
hear
the
tower
door
gently
open
did
not
hear
the
soft
creeping
footsteps
of
the
king
as
he
came
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
shuffled
across
the
soft
grass
toward
his
plaything
chapter
vii
the
answer
to
burgundy
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
roused
villon
from
his
honeyed
meditations
and
he
turned
with
a
start
to
find
the
sable
figure
of
the
king
at
his
side
and
the
sinister
visage
smiling
upon
him
good
afternoon
lord
constable
louis
said
amiably
and
as
villon
dropped
respectfully
on
his
knee
he
questioned
does
power
taste
well
nobly
sire
on
my
knees
let
me
thank
your
majesty
nonsense
man
i
pleasing
myself
you
sang
yourself
into
splendour
françois
were
the
king
of
france
eh
villon
rose
with
voice
and
gesture
of
apologetic
entreaty
your
majesty
will
understand
louis
brushed
his
apologies
aside
blandly
perfectly
my
good
friend
you
captivated
me
with
what
a
flashing
eye
with
what
a
radiant
forehead
with
what
a
lofty
carriage
you
thundered
your
verses
at
me
i
said
to
myself
a
real
man
a
man
with
a
mission
a
man
who
may
serve
france
sire
that
has
been
my
hunger
dream
of
plenty
louis
clasped
his
thin
arms
across
his
chest
and
hugged
himself
affectionately
well
i
could
very
well
make
you
king
you
know
and
i
if
i
could
for
i
have
a
fancy
for
the
task
myself
but
i
owed
you
a
good
turn
and
your
own
words
prompted
the
payment
poor
devil
shall
taste
power
i
said
will
make
him
my
grand
constable
villon
joy
was
so
great
that
he
was
unable
to
hear
the
king
out
but
interrupted
him
with
enthusiastic
promises
sire
i
will
serve
you
as
never
king
was
served
louis
went
on
unheeding
and
his
quiet
monotonous
words
fell
on
the
hot
brain
of
the
poet
and
chilled
it
i
will
make
him
my
grand
constable
for
a
week
if
louis
had
jerked
a
dagger
into
villon
side
he
could
not
have
more
surely
hurt
his
victim
a
week
sire
villon
gasped
almost
unable
to
realize
the
meaning
of
the
king
words
louis
turned
upon
him
and
snarled
at
him
good
lord
did
your
vanity
credit
a
permanent
appointment
come
friend
come
that
would
be
pushing
the
joke
too
far
all
the
sunlight
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
the
world
all
the
scent
out
of
the
roses
villon
could
only
repeat
to
himself
a
week
and
stare
vacantly
at
the
king
the
king
emphasized
his
offer
lingering
over
it
lovingly
even
so
one
wonderful
week
seven
delirious
days
he
paused
for
an
instant
as
he
counted
one
hundred
and
heavenly
hours
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
the
world
was
made
in
seven
days
seven
days
of
power
seven
days
of
splendour
seven
days
of
love
villon
gave
a
groan
of
despair
for
his
golden
hopes
and
then
go
back
to
the
garret
and
the
kennel
the
tavern
and
the
brothel
louis
malign
smile
deepened
he
came
closer
to
the
poet
and
tapped
him
on
the
chest
with
his
lean
forefinger
he
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
no
no
not
exactly
he
hummed
you
do
taste
the
full
force
of
the
joke
yet
in
a
week
time
you
will
build
me
a
big
gibbet
in
the
place
de
greve
and
there
your
last
task
as
grand
constable
will
be
to
hang
master
françois
villon
if
the
world
had
been
colourless
and
scentless
before
it
was
now
no
better
than
a
hideous
heap
of
ashes
if
villon
had
run
up
a
heavy
reckoning
with
the
king
at
the
fircone
tavern
must
he
wipe
out
the
score
with
his
villon
fell
at
the
king
feet
with
extended
hands
and
agonized
beseeching
eyes
sire
sire
have
pity
the
king
looked
down
on
him
in
disdain
are
you
so
fond
of
life
are
you
so
poor
a
thing
that
you
prize
your
garret
and
your
kennel
your
tavern
and
your
brothel
so
highly
villon
bowed
his
head
i
was
content
yesterday
the
king
surveyed
the
cowering
figure
with
growing
contempt
can
you
be
content
please
yourself
there
is
still
a
door
open
to
you
you
can
go
back
to
your
garret
this
very
moment
if
you
choose
say
the
word
and
my
servants
shall
strip
you
of
your
smart
feathers
and
drub
you
into
the
street
villon
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
your
majesty
be
merciful
he
implored
the
king
scorn
blazed
out
you
read
louis
of
france
a
lesson
and
louis
of
france
returns
the
compliment
i
took
you
for
true
gold
and
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
only
base
metal
you
mouthed
your
longing
for
the
chance
to
show
what
you
could
do
here
is
your
chance
take
it
or
leave
it
but
remember
that
i
never
change
my
mind
you
may
have
your
week
of
wonder
if
you
wish
but
if
you
do
by
my
word
as
a
king
you
shall
swing
for
it
villon
rose
to
his
feet
and
caught
at
his
throat
as
if
the
grip
of
the
rope
were
at
that
very
moment
closing
about
it
he
choked
as
he
spoke
in
god
name
sire
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
torture
me
thus
the
king
snapped
his
answer
you
have
mocked
a
king
and
maimed
a
minister
you
ca
get
off
scot
free
villon
bewildered
thoughts
forced
themselves
into
words
he
spoke
not
so
much
to
the
king
as
to
himself
desperately
trying
to
decide
heaven
help
me
life

its

living

of

then
a
shameful
death
he
flung
himself
on

and
crouched
there
shuddering
the
king
patted
him
on
the
back

to

he
had
taken
off
his
black
velvet
cap
and
ran
his
eye
over
the
little
row
of
metal
saints
which
encircled
it
as
if
he
were
meditating
to
which
particular
patron
he
should
recommend

left

a
little
thing
happened
which
meant
much
to
four
people
katherine
came
on
to
the
terrace
with
noel
le
jolys
she
had
a
lute
in
her
hand
and
she
touched
its
chords
lightly
seeking
to
make
an
air
for
words
as
she
idled
the
time
with
her
wooer
louis
saw
her
though
villon
did
not
for
he
was
huddled
in
a
heap
on
the
marble
seat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
trying
to
control
his
whirling
thoughts
a
new
demon
of
mischief
entered
the
king
heart
how
he
thought
if
my
lady
virtue
who
flouted
me
could
be
lured
to
love
this
he
ambled
across
to
where
villon
lay
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
villon
turned
to
him
a
face
drawn
and
white
with
agony
one
further
chance
fellow
said
the
king
if
the
count
of
montcorbier
win
the
heart
of
lady
katherine
de
vaucelles
within
the
week
he
shall
escape
the
gallows
and
carry
his
lady
love
where
he
pleases
on
your
word
of
honour
sire
my
word
is
my
honour
master
françois
well
at
this
very
moment
it
pleased
heaven
that
katherine
sitting
on
the
terrace
and
smiling
at
the
adoration
in
noel
le
jolys
eyes
seemed
to
find
the
air
she
sought
and
began
to
sing
the
tune
was
quaint
and
plaintive
tender
as
an
ancient
lullaby
the
words
were
the
words
of
the
tortured
poet
and
as
he
heard
them
a
new
hope
seemed
to
come
into
his
heart
life
is
unstable
love
may
uphold
fear
goes
in
sable

in

mystery
covers
midnight
and

heroes
and

cry
for

well
said
the
king
you
cried
for
the
moon
i
give
it
to
you
and
i
take
it
at
your
hands
villon
thundered
give
me
my
week
of
wonders
though
i
die
a
dog
death
at
the
end
of
it
i
will
show
france
and
her
what
lay
in
the
heart
of
the
poor
rhymester
louis
applauded
clapping
his
thin
hands
together
gleefully
spoken
like
a
man
but
remember
a
bargain
a
bargain
if
you
fail
to
win
the
lady
you
must
with
heaven
help
keep
yourself
for
the
gallows
no
no
flinging
away
your
life
on
some
other
fool
sword
i
give
you
the
moon
but
i
want
my
price
for
it
villon
blood
now
ran
warm
again
in
its
channels
and
he
answered
stoutly
sire
i
will
keep
my
bargain
give
me
my
week
of
opportunity
and
if
i
do
not
make
the
most
of
it
i
shall
deserve
the
death
to
which
you
devote
me
even
as
he
spoke
the
air
was
stirred
with
a
cheerful
flourish
of
trumpets
and
the
quiet
garden
was
invaded
by
tristan
and
a
company
of
soldiers
escorting
a
tall
and
stately
gentleman
whose
gorgeous
tabard
proclaimed
him
to
be
toison
the
herald
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
news
of
his
coming
had
run
through
the
palace
and
the
terrace
was
suddenly
flooded
with
courtiers
and
ladies
eager
to
hear
what
the
enemy
envoy
had
to
say
and
what
answer
the
king
would
send
back
to
him
louis
seated
himself
on
the
marble
seat
anigh
the
image
of
pan
and
drew
villon
down
beside
him
listen
well
to
this
man
words
my
lord
constable
he
whispered
and
then
turning
to
the
gleaming
figure
of
the
herald
he
demanded
your
message
sir
toison
advanced
a
few
feet
nearer
to
the
monarch
and
spoke
in
a
ringing
voice
in
the
name
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
of
his
allies
and
assembled
in
solemn
leaguer
outside
the
walls
of
paris
i
hereby
summon
you
louis
of
france
to
surrender
this
city
unconditionally
and
to
yield
yourself
in
confidence
to
my
mercy
the
king
folded
his
hands
over
his
knees
and
inclined
his
head
a
little
like
an
enquiring
bird
and
if
we
refuse
sir
herald
the
herald
answered
promptly
the
worst
disasters
of
war
fire
and
sword
and
famine
much
blood
to
shed
and
much
gold
to
pay
and
for
yourself
no
hope
of
pardon
great
words
the
king
sneered
the
herald
replied
proudly
the
angels
of
great
deeds
villon
had
been
sitting
listening
as
a
man
listens
in
a
dream
almost
unconscious
of
what
was
taking
place
among
the
ladies
on
the
terrace
katherine
stood
conspicuous
in
her
youth
and
beauty
and
to
her
his
eyes
were
turned
in
worship
the
quarrels
of
great
princes
the
destinies
of
france
were
for
the
moment
indifferent
to
him
he
forgot
his
high
desires
of
empire
his
swelling
belief
in
his
real
mission
he
was
only
conscious
that
a
great
prize
lay
temptingly
within
his
grasp
that
he
might
win
his
heart
desire
louis
interrupted
his
reverie
the
count
of
montcorbier
constable
of
france
is
my
counsellor
his
voice
delivers
my
mind
speak
friend
and
give
this
messenger
his
answer
he
touched
villon
on
the
arm
and
villon
turned
to
him
in
astonishment
as
i
will
sire
the
king
caught
him
up
impatiently
yes
go
on
go
on
villon
were
the
king
of
france
villon
leaped
to
his
feet
and
advanced
toward
the
herald
a
wild
exultation
filled
his
veins
with
fire
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
lord
of
the
world
as
if
his
hands
held
the
scales
that
decided
the
destinies
of
nations
he
had
always
dreamed
of
the
great
deeds
he
would
do
and
now
great
deeds
were
possible
to
him
and
at
least
he
would
try
to
do
them
he
looked
straight
into
the
changeless
face
but
his
heart
shrined
katherine
as
he
spoke
herald
of
burgundy
in
god
name
and
the
king
i
bid
you
go
back
to
your
master
and
say
this
kings
are
great
in
the
eyes
of
their
people
but
the
people
are
great
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
it
is
the
people
of
france
who
answer
you
in
the
name
of
this
epitome
the
people
of
paris
are
not
so
poor
of
spirit
that
they
fear
the
croak
of
the
burgundian
ravens
we
are
well
victualled
we
are
well
armed
we
lie
snug
and
warm
behind
our
stout
walls
we
laugh
at
your
leaguer
but
when
we
who
eat
are
hungry
when
we
who
drink
are
dry
when
we
who
glow
are
frozen
when
there
is
neither
bite
on
the
board
nor
sup
in
the
pitcher
nor
spark
upon
the
hearth
our
answer
to
rebellious
burgundy
will
be
the
same
you
are
knocking
at
our
doors
beware
lest
we
open
them
and
come
forth
to
speak
with
our
enemy
at
the
gate
we
give
you
back
defiance
for
defiance
menace
for
menace
blow
for
blow
this
is
our
answer
this
and
the
drawn
sword
god
and
denis
for
the
king
of
france
as
he
spoke
he
drew
his
sword
and
flashed
it
aloft
in
the
sunlight
there
was
contagion
in
his
burning
words
and
every
soldier
present
bared
his
blade
and
pointed
it
to
heaven
while
villon
cry
was
repeated
upon
a
hundred
lips
as
toison
turned
and
left
the
presence
katherine
came
swiftly
down
the
steps
and
flung
herself
at
villon
feet
my
lord
she
said
with
my
lips
the
women
of
france
thank
you
for
your
words
of
flame
louis
leaned
forward
smiling
sardonically
mistress
what
does
this
mean
he
questioned
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
looking
into
villon
face
with
eyes
that
mirrored
the
admiration
shining
in
his
eyes
it
means
sire
that
a
man
has
come
to
court
chapter
viii
a
word
with
dom
gregory
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
the
materials
for
building
up
a
practical
presentment
of
the
real
of
master
françois
villon
are
so
slight
that
in
the
historical
sense
they
might
almost
be
said
to
be
we
know
indeed
a
little
of
master
françois
early
days
partly
from
some
confessions
which
must
at
all
times
be
interpreted
with
a
liberal
sense
of
humour
and
glossed
with
an
infinite
deal
of
good
nature
and
partly
from
stray
records
made
by
those
who
do
not
seem
to
have
held
the
vagrant
poet
very
warm
in
their
hearts
but
of
his
life
in
those
days
of
which
this
chronicle
deals
there
is
little
to
find
where
there
is
much
to
seek
the
silence
of
commines
may
be
explained
in
a
thousand
ways
possibly
professional
jealousy
of
one
minister
for
another
who
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
did
so
much
and
so
well
possibly
ignorance
of
the
real
facts
of
the
case
for
it
is
fairly
certain
that
king
louis
kept
his
jape
and
its
sequel
very
much
to
himself
possibly
because
commines
felt
that
his
cold
spirit
was
scarcely
equal
to
the
proper
recording
of
so
whimsical
and
oriental
an
adventure
good
master
clement
marot
when
he
took
it
upon
himself
generations
after
our
poet
was
dust
and
ashes
to
edit
our
poet
writings
said
much
in
praise
of
the
singer
but
said
little
no
doubt
because
he
knew
little
of
the
poet
life
and
the
great
creator
of
pantagruel
and
gargantua
the
immeasurable
alcofribias
nasier
whom
the
world
loves
or
hates
as
rabelais
in
what
he
contributed
to
our
knowledge
of
françois
villon
has
only
to
use
a
and
phrase
made
confusion
yet
worse
confounded
we
should
be
at
a
deadlock
indeed
if
it
were
not
for
poitou
and
its
abbey
of
bonne
aventure
whose
library
is
luckily
rich
in
historical
manuscripts
of
the
period
and
richest
of
all
in
that
priceless
manuscript
of
dom
gregory
which
treating
in
general
of
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
poitou
in
the
fifteenth
century
dealt
so
particularly
and
so
liberally
with
the
life
of
master
françois
villon
because
master
françois
villon
in
his
old
age
was
so
excellent
a
patron
of
the
church
we
say
dealt
advisedly
for
time
has
treated
somewhat
scurvily
the
fair
skins
of
parchment
upon
which
the
good
dom
gregory
recorded
his
thoughts
and
his
opinions
at
considerable
length
as
the
rich
setting
of
the
facts
too
few
in
number
with
which
he
condescended
to
enlighten
posterity
many
pieces
of
parchment
are
missing
from
the
roll
of
his
record
and
unhappily
the
greatest
gap
in
the
story
is
precisely
at
that
point
where
our
hero
found
himself
so
suddenly
and
so
strangely
taken
into
favour
by
his
king
and
so
suddenly
and
so
strangely
smiled
upon
by
his
mistress
we
have
indeed
some
admirable
homiletics
of
the
worthy
friar
in
praise
of
the
conduct
and
carriage
of
master
françois
villon
at
the
time
of
his
unexpected
exaltation
after
a
gracious
invocation
of
many
saints
and
angels
the
very
elect
of
the
company
of
heaven
dom
gregory
in
a
fine
spirit
of
rectitude
proceeds
to
applaud
the
count
of
montcorbier
for
the
high
example
he
set
to
his
here
in
effect
says
the
worthy
churchman
was
a
man
who
having
passed
the
flower
of
his
life
in
squalor
and
all
manner
of
ignobilities
still
kept
in
a
sense
the
whiteness
of
his
soul
and
allowed
the
brightness
of
the
celestial
flame
to
burn
faintly
indeed
but
unextinguished
on
the
altar
of
his
heart
how
many
men
asks
dom
gregory
glowing
with
a
pious
gratification
how
many
men
who
in
humility
have
dreamed
that
they
might
under
serener
stars
and
happier
auspices
do
great
deeds
and
win
honourable
honours
would
if
put
to
the
proof
show
themselves
as
splendid
in
prosperity
as
they
dreamed
themselves
in
adversity
master
françois
villon
he
goes
on
to
say
is
the
loveliest
example
known
to
him
of
a
man
who
having
always
believed
in
himself
with
a
great
belief
did
on
being
put
to
the
test
prove
that
his
belief
was
founded
not
on
the
shifting
sands
of
vanity
and
vain
glory
but
on
the
solid
granite
of
good
faith
and
the
inestimable
doctrines
of
the
church
from
all
this
we
gather
dimly
as
one
discerns
objects
in
a
mist
that
master
françois
villon
as
count
of
montcorbier
proved
nimself
to
be
little
less
than
equal
to
the
high
opinion
of
himself
which
he
had
confided
all
unwittingly
into
the
ear
of
his
masquerading
sovereign
but
the
pages
in
which
dom
gregory
sets
forth
at
length
exactly
all
that
master
françois
villon
did
and
said
and
thought
during
the
period
of
his
astonishing
probation
are
unfortunately
lost
to
the
abbey
of
bonne
aventure
and
in
consequence
to
the
world
no
less
than
six
folios
consecrated
by
the
careful
pen
of
dom
gregory
to
this
memorable
epoch
have
vanished
from
the
priceless
manuscript
the
custodian
of
the
abbey
library
will
tell
you
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
these
pages
disappeared
during
the
storm
and
stress
of
the
french
revolution
but
travellers
in
france
are
too
well
aware
of
the
readiness
of
ecclesiastical
custodians
to
attribute
all
things
evil
to
the
time
of
the
great
upheaval
to
pay
any
serious
attention
to
this
particular
allegation
however
it
happened
the
pages
are
lost
and
there
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
an
end
of
them
but
in
a
way
we
are
able
to
piece
together
from
dorn
gregory
later
statements
and
from
certain
traditions
which
still
linger
here
and
there
in
the
highways
and
byways
of
poitou
enough
material
to
enable
us
to
ascertain
with
something
like
sufficient
accuracy
what
it
was
that
master
françois
villon
did
accomplish
as
count
of
montcorbier
in
those
seven
days
of
splendour
which
his
mocking
king
accorded
to
him
we
know
for
certain
that
the
king
found
him
an
admirable
counsellor
cool
wary
and
judicious
and
that
during
the
period
of
his
ministry
louis
followed
his
advice
with
a
faith
which
if
it
were
founded
indeed
upon
a
superstitious
adherence
to
the
edicts
of
the
stars
proved
itself
to
be
thoroughly
justified
by
his
lord
constable
common
sense
foresight
and
astonishing
knowledge
of
human
nature
we
know
too
that
he
proved
himself
no
less
skilled
as
a
soldier
than
as
a
statesman
as
capable
of
in
the
arts
of
war
as
in
the
arts
of
peace
his
knowledge
of
caesar
commentaries
and
his
natural
inclination
to
strategy
interpreted
by
an
eloquent
tongue
fired
by
a
ready
mother
wit
earned
him
the
ear
and
won
him
the
heart
of
the
king
great
captains
and
wrung
from
them
at
first
a
reluctant
but
finally
such
a
delighted
adherence
as
their
sires
had
been
compelled
to
surrender
to
the
maid
of
orleans
yet
while
our
poet
was
playing
these
two
parts
he
managed
his
affairs
so
dexterously
that
he
seemed
to
the
general
eye
to
be
playing
but
one
part
and
that
the
part
of
the
dazzlingly
magnificent
courtier
if
his
mornings
were
given
to
consultation
with
the
king
and
the
king
chief
soldiers
if
his
forenoons
were
devoted
to
the
confirming
of
edicts
and
the
promulgations
of
laws
all
tending
to
alleviate
the
condition
and
lighten
the
load
of
the
people
of
paris
his
afternoons
and
evenings
and
shining
summer
nights
were
entirely
surrendered
to
the
glittering
pleasures
and
pastimes
of
a
man
of
ease

hear
of

and
ball
and
masquerade
pageant
and
play
and
pastime
each
one
of
which
seemed
to
be
the
last
word
of
wealthy
ingenuity
until
it
was
eclipsed
by
its
still
more
splendid
successor
and
it
was
this
part
of
which
the
count
of
montcorbier
chose
to
make
the
most
with
a
very
special
purpose
he
caused
it
seems
many
emissaries
of
his
to
quit
paris
and
find
shelter
within
the
duke
of
burgundy
lines
pretending
to
be
deserters
from
the
waning
cause
of
the
king
each
of
whom
had
the
same
tale
to
tell
to
the
credulous
ears
of
the
enemy
namely
that
the
king
new
favourite
was
a
wastrel
and
a
fool
who
had
no
better
purpose
in
life
than
the
rhyming
of
madrigals
the
tuning
of
lutes
the
draining
of
flagons
and
the
pressing
of
ladies
fingers
in
the
dance
all
of
which
produced
we
are
assured
upon
the
mind
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
the
very
effect
desired
by
villon
and
led
to
results
which
luckily
we
are
enabled
to
know
more
of
as

gregory
manuscript
happily
resumes
continuity
on
the
seventh
day
of
master
françois
week
of
wonder
we
further
learn
for
dom
gregory
though
a
churchman
seems
to
have
a
kindly
spot
in
his
heart
for
the
ways
of
lovers
that
during
those
seven
days
the
friendship
of
villon
and
katherine
grew
apace
and
that
the
whole
court
watched
with
interest
and
monsieur
noel
le
jolys
with
an
fury
the
growth
of
a
great
and
beautiful
passion
but
it
seems
that
master
villon
whether
from
fear
to
risk
too
soon
or
from
a
desire
to
leave
the
loveliest
moment
of
his
reign
to
the
last
made
no
attempt
directly
to
declare
himself
or
directly
to
learn
how
high
he
stood
in
the
lady
katherine
heart
until
the
very
day
which
was
the
last
day
upon
which
it
was
possible
for
him
to
assure
his
own
salvation
if
i
were
to
die
chapter
ix
on
the
seventh
day
of
villon
week
of
wonder
his
glory
was
at
its
greatest
no
fairer
day
had
traced
that
radiant
month
of
june
and
no
more
splendid
pageantry
had
adorned
the
illustrious
reign
of
the
new
grand
constable
mimic
battles
fountains
running
wine
free
doles
of
food
fantastic
pageants
grotesque
dances
all
the
gorgeous
mummery
that
the
fifteenth
century
delighted
in
was
offered
in
profusion
to
please
the
fancy
and
win
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
paris
but
the
crowning
triumph
was
the
great
festival
which
the
grand
constable
gave
with
the
king
permission
in
the
king
own
rose
garden
the
magnificent
mascarado
in
the
italian
manner
to
which
all
who
were
associated
with
the
court
were
summoned
this
revelry
which
began
at
sunset
was
intended
to
overtop
all
possible
courtly
ceremonials
in
the
splendour
of
its
equipment
the
lavishness
of
its
display
the
richness
and
profusion
of
its
hospitality
it
was
near
to
the
hour
of
sunset
when
villon
sat
with
the
king
in
the
little
room
in
the
grey
tower
from
which
the
king
loved
to
follow
the
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
on
the
table
by
which
the
king
and
villon
were
seated
lay
a
large
chart
of
the
country
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
paris
and
in
front
of
the
table
stood
three
of
the
king
most
trusty
commanders
the
lord
du
lau
the
lord
poncet
de
riviere
and
the
lord
of
nantoillet
villon
had
been
explaining
to
the
king
and
to
his
military
advisers
a
scheme
which
had
been
growing
in
his
mind
throughout
the
week
for
the
confusion
of
the
enemy
a
scheme
for
which
the
gorgeous
entertainment
to
be
given
that
evening
was
to
serve
as
a
golden
mask
villon
touched
a
point
on
the
map
which
represented
a
spot
very
familiar
to
him
a
little
dip
in
the
swelling
land
where
he
used
to
play
as
a
child
and
gather
wildflowers
and
hide
himself
and
imagine
that
he
was
a
bandit
or
a
great
captain
or
a
fairy
prince
any
one
of
the
thousand
illusions
of
childhood
at
its
play
there
sire
he
said
if
we
can
lure
the
burgundians
to
that
hollow
the
day
is
ours
the
sloping
ground
above
it
will
mask
a
thousand
men
poncet
de
riviere
leaned
forward
questioningly
are
you
sure
of
the
lay
of
the
land
villon
answered
positively
sure
i
played
truant
there
when
i
was
no
higher
than
your
sword
belt
nantoillet
spoke
as
a
man
who
weighs
his
words
the
scheme
seems
feasible
sire
villon
glanced
up
from
the
table
in
humourous
apology
you
may
think
me
a
raw
soldier
he
said
yet
i
have
practised
strategy
all
my
days
du
lau
answered
him
approvingly
my
lord
you
reason
like
a
seasoned
veteran
pleased
with
the
praise
villon
turned
to
the
king
sire
i
have
blown
it
abroad
that
your
majesty
feasts
while
the
duke
of
burgundy
believes
us
to
be
carousing
we
shall
make
a
sortie
from
anthony
gate
our
horses
hooves
will
be
muffled
no
spur
shall
jingle
and
no
bridle
clink
we
will
steal
through
the
night
like
shadows
at
the
cross
road
some
few
of
us
will
make
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
left
and
beat
a
retreat
this
will
tempt
him
into
our
ambuscade
and
as
i
believe
end
in
his
rout
at
nine
my
lords
farewell
he
raised
his
hand
in
dismissal
the
three
captains
saluted
the
king
and
his
minister
and
passed
out
of
the
presence
as
they
descended
the
winding
stairs
du
lau
said
to
his
companions
i
do
not
know
your
hearts
my
lords
but
i
love
this
soldier
of
fortune
nantoillet
answered
cordially
god
knows
where
he
came
from
and
god
knows
where
he
will
go
to
but
i
would
ride
with
him
to
the
world
end
my
father
said
poncet
de
riviere
told
me
often
of
the
maid
of
orleans
and
her
power
with
bearded
men
he
must
be
of
her
kindred
for
he
wins
me
against
my
will
as
the
sound
of
their
feet
died
away
in
the
depths
of
the
tower
villon
turned
to
the
king
if
the
duke
of
burgundy
falls
into
my
trap
he
said
men
will
call
me
a
great
captain
yet
it
is
no
more
than
remembering
the
shape
of
a
meadow
where
i
played
in
childhood
strange
that
an
urchin
playground
should
become
a
golgotha
of
graves
and
glories
the
king
clapped
him
playfully
on
the
shoulder
where
did
you
learn
wisdom
in
the
school
of
hope
deferred
when
i
was
what
i
was
i
still
believed
that
this
dingy
carcass
swaddled
a
roman
spirit
in
the
pomp
of
my
pallet
i
dreamed
olympian
dreams
and
the
dreams
have
come
true
you
are
an
amazing
fellow
here
in
a
week
you
have
made
me
more
popular
than
i
made
myself
since
my
accession
in
court
in
camp
in
council
men
are
pleased
to
call
you
paragon
i
am
a
man
of
the
people
and
i
know
what
the
people
need
a
week
ago
the
good
people
of
paris
were
disloyal
enough
i
repeal
the
tax
on
wine
and
they
clap
their
hands
and
cry
save
king
louis
lustily
a
week
ago
your
soldiers
were
mutinous
because
they
were
ill
fed
worse
clothed
and
never
paid
at
all
i
feed
them
full
clothe
them
warm
pay
them
well
and
your
majesty
has
an
army
that
would
follow
me
to
the
devil
if
i
whistled
a
marching
tune
but
in
the
meantime
your
sands
are
running
out
is
your
heart
failing
is
your
pulse
flagging
not
a
whit
i
have
been
translated
without
discredit
from
the
tavern
to
the
palace
and
if
the
worse
comes
to
the
worst
i
may
say
with
the
dying
caesar
me
the
king
grinned
sardonically
will
the
worse
come
to
the
worst
he
piped
how
is
your
suit
with
the
lady
katherine
villon
smile
lingered
still
on
his
lips
as
he
answered
sire
no
wise
man
boasts
that
he
knows
the
heart
of
a
woman
and
yet
i
hope
for
the
best
but
if
you
fail
the
king
persisted
villon
smile
grew
more
philosophical
in
his
heart
he
felt
fairly
confident
but
spoke
cautiously
why
then
when
the
housewife
moon
kindles
her
pale
fire
on
the
hearth
of
heaven
i
shall
be
quiet
enough
but
either
way
you
have
given
me
a
royal
week
and
i
have
made
the
most
of
it
lived
a
thousand
lives
eaten
my
cake
to
the
last
sweet
crumb
and
have
known
the
meaning
of
kingship
louis
laughed
you
speak
as
if
you
had
reigned
for
a
century
villon
sententious
mood
deepened
a
man
might
live
a
thousand
years
and
yet
be
no
more
account
at
the
last
than
as
a
great
eater
of
dinners
whereas
to
suck
all
the
sweet
and
snuff
all
the
perfume
but
of
a
single
hour
to
push
all
its
possibilities
to
the
edge
of
the
chessboard
is
to
live
greatly
though
it
be
not
to
live
long
and
an
end
is
an
end
if
it
come
on
the
winged
heels
of
a
week
or
the
dull
crutch
of
a
century
louis
leaned
back
and
looked
at
his
companion
in
astonishment
pray
heaven
this
philosophy
may
sound
as
fine
when
your
neck
is
in
the
halter
your
majesty
wit
and
my
wish
run
nose
and
nose
in
a
leash
louis
changed
the
subject
as
if
there
were
more
important
matters
in
the
world
than
the
life
loves
and
death
even
of
a
grand
constable
messire
noel
brings
me
a
new
astrologer
the
heavens
seem
in
a
conspiracy
of
confusion
the
stars
are
all
a
tangle
my
dream
of
a
star
falling
from
heaven
defies
divination
villon
looked
at
him
pityingly
do
you
never
tire
of
these
sky
doctors
he
questioned
louis
frowned
as
he
always
frowned
at
any
hint
of
disbelief
in
the
science
of
the
stars
do
jest
master
poet
he
said
but
ply
your
suit
with
proud
kate
for
i
swear
if
you
fail
you
shall
hang
now
leave
me
for
i
must
work
while
you
play
and
he
bent
over
a
chart
and
seemed
to
forget
all
else
in
his
profound
contemplation
villon
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
went
out
of
the
room
and
descended
the
steps
opened
the
little
door
and
passed
into
the
garden
the
summer
sun
was
dying
in
a
splendid
riot
of
colour
among
the
rose
trees
its
last
rays
falling
on
the
face
of
the
god
pan
illuminated
his
fantastic
features
and
seemed
to
lend
them
the
life
of
an
ironic
leer
the
warm
air
was
rich
with
the
blended
odours
of
a
thousand
blossoms
and
from
the
palace
faint
and
far
off
came
the
sound
of
joyous
voices
it
was
almost
the
moment
when
the
rose
garden
was
to
be
thrown
open
to
the
royal
guests
villon
pulled
a
rose
from
a
bush
by
his
hand
and
gazed
into
its
crimson
heart
as
if
he
sought
to
read
there
the
secret
which
all
flowers
hold
but
which
no
flower
has
ever
yet
betrayed
to
the
longing
eyes
of
a
poet
he
leaned
against
the
statue
of
pan
and
mused
pensively
the
petals
of
my
reign
are
falling
from
me
full
of
life
full
of
colour
to
the
end
shall
i
win
this
wonderful
woman
am
i
mad
to
hope
it
if
i
lose
it
is
a
short
shrift
and
a
long
rope
at
the
end
of
a
dazzling
dream
he
shivered
as
he
thought
and
cast
the
rose
he
held
away
from
him
how
cold
the
june
air
seems
and
these
roses
smell
of
graves
he
paused
a
little
till
his
hopes
took
heart
again
but
if
i
win
how
will
it
be
i
wonder
to
marry
my
heart
desire
to
grow
old
sedately
to
live
again
with
the
children
on
my
knee
a
little
françois
here
more
honest
than
his
father
a
little
katherine
there
less
comely
than
her
mother
he
flung
out
his
hands
as
if
he
were
dismissing
the
phantoms
of
his
fancy
run
away
my
dear
dream
children
to
your
playground
of
shadows
where
you
belong
for
your
father
may
be
hanged
and
he
fights
for
love
and
life
villon
reflections
were
fluttered
by
a
sudden
blare
of
music
and
a
gaudy
fellow
in
a
pursuivant
coat
made
his
appearance
on
the
top
of
the
terrace
and
rattled
blast
after
blast
from
his
brazen
trumpet
in
obedience
to
the
signal
a
crowd
of
revellers
gushed
from
the
palace
and
flowed
like
a
glowing
wave
of
down
the
steps
and
into
the
walks
and
alleys
of
the
rose
garden
all
the
strange
figures
that
a
freakish
fancy
could
suggest
leaped
and
danced
and
shouted
in
a
rapture
of
and
follies
clowns
and
devils
wheeled
wildly
by
waving
torches
clashing
cymbals
or
screaming
at
the
top
of
their
voices
while
sedater
spirits
masked
and
muffled
in
mantles
of
sombre
hue
moved
through
the
tumultuous
throng
and
found
their
abated
pleasure
in
mystification
and
intrigues
villon
had
a
mask
in
his
girdle
he
put
it
on
and
pushing
into
the
press
allowed
himself
to
drift
hither
and
thither
with
the
eddying
currents
of
pleasure
his
fantastic
imagination
took
fire
from
the
strange
shapes
and
sounds
about
him
the
sense
of
being
in
a
dream
which
had
never
deserted
him
from
the
first
moment
of
his
awakened
consciousness
in
the
rose
garden
clung
closely
about
him
on
this
night
and
the
jocund
figures
around
him
flitted
by
as
unreal
as
the
phantoms
of
a
sleep
suddenly
his
attention
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
seemed
familiar
to
him
a
man
habited
like
a
pilgrim
from
the
holy
land
in
long
hood
and
gabardine
of
grey
and
with
the
cockleshell
on
his
shoulder
had
met
another
masker
habited
like
himself
the
pair
were
exchanging
salutations
in
a
speech
that
the
speakers
might
well
assume
to
be
unknown
to
any
person
in
the
royal
garden
the
speech
however
jingled
very
familiarly
on
ear
for
the
man
was
talking
in
the
amazing
jargon
which
the
worshipful
company
of
cockleshells
had
devised
for
the
better
furtherance
of
their
thievish
purposes
and
it
appealed
to
villon
as
intimately
as
a
song
that
is
learned
in
childhood
the
first
pilgrim
questioned
the
other
what
do
you
carry
in
your
scrip
and
the
second
answered
i
carry
a
cockleshell
the
first
pilgrim
questioned
again
what
do
you
carry
in
your
hand
and
the
second
responded
a
foot
of
steel
yet
again
the
first
speaker
queried
will
you
drink
the
king
health
and
the
answer
came
decisively
in
a
flagon
of
burgundy
whereat
the
two
pilgrims
saluted
and
parted
and
went
their
several
ways
and
were
swallowed
up
in
the
motley
masquerade
villon
curiosity
was
piqued
to
the
quick
how
in
heaven
name
he
asked
himself
does
it
come
to
pass
that
people
speaking
the
thieves
lingo
of
the
court
of
miracles
find
themselves
at
a
feast
in
the
rose
garden
of
king
louis
he
set
himself
to
try
and
track
down
one
or
the
other
of
the
mysterious
pilgrims
but
neither
of
them
was
to
be
found
his
wanderings
brought
him
back
to
the
fair
space
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
protected
by
the
image
of
the
god
pan
the
place
was
deserted
the
revellers
had
drifted
elsewhere
a
lute
lay
on
the
marble
seat
villon
seated
himself
and
taking
up
the
instrument
was
touching
it
carelessly
when
a
light
step
on
the
grass
arrested
him
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
sounded
in
his
ears
and
he
found
himself
addressed
by
the
lady
katherine
de
vaucelles
who
was
attended
by
a
number
of
fair
court
ladies
i
am
the
voice
of
these
ladies
to
pray
for
a
favour
villon
bowed
low
my
ear
is
all
obedience
he
said
and
my
heart
all
homage
you
are
a
poet
my
lord
said
katherine
and
this
is
an
eve
which
should
please
a
poet
rhyme
us
a
rhyme
which
shall
match
this
night
of
summer
villon
sighed
a
little
no
rhyme
ever
rhymed
was
worth
a
beam
of
summer
sun
or
summer
moon
but
i
have
lingered
in
provence
where
every
man
is
a
nightingale
and
i
caught
there
the
fever
of
improvisation
what
shall
i
rhyme
about
katherine
laughed
as
she
pointed
to
her
attendant
ladies
your
suitors
are
women
therefore
nothing
better
nor
worse
than
love
the
burden
of
the
world
villon
said
sigh
my
lute
sigh
he
let
his
fingers
ripple
over
the
strings
waking
the
faint
wail
of
a
plaintive
minor
in
a
moment
or
two
he
began
to
recite
touching
every
now
and
then
a
chord
on
his
lute
to
emphasize
the
words
he
spoke
i
wonder
in
what
isle
of
bliss
apollo
music
fills
the
air
in
what
green
valley
artemis
for
young
endymion
spreads
the
snare
where
venus
lingers
debonair
the
wind
has
blown
them
all
away
and
pan
lies
piping
in
his
lair
where
are
the
gods
of
yesterday
say
where
the
great
semiramis
sleeps
in
a
tomb
and
where
the
precious
dust
of
caesar
is
or
cleopatra
yellow
hair
where
alexander
the
wind
has
blown
them
all
away
and
redbeard
of
the
iron
chair
where
are
the
dreams
of
yesterday
where
is
the
queen
of
herod
kiss
and
phryne
in
her
beauty
bare
by
what
strange
sea
does
tomyris
with
dido
and
cassandra
share
divine
proserpina
despair
the
wind
has
blown
them
all
away
for
what
poor
ghost
does
helen
care
where
are
the
girls
of
yesterday
alas
for
lovers
pair
by
pair
the
wind
has
blown
them
all
away
the
young
and
yare
the
fond
and
fair
where
are
the
snows
of
yesterday
the
little
group
whom
he
addressed
lingered
in
a
gracious
silence
for
a
short
space
singer
and
listeners
seemed
to
be
in
an
exquisite
isolation
of
moonlight
and
soft
odours
katherine
murmured
pensively
to
herself
where
are
the
snows
of
yesterday
her
eyes
were
shining
like
summer
stars
her
parted
lips
made
villon
think
of
ripe
pomegranates
her
mind
was
wandering
in
the
islands
of
the
blest
with
the
lovers
and
ladies
whom
villon
had
praised
villon
dismissed
melancholy
with
a
jest
sweet
ladies
he
said
my
song
is
sung
do
not
let
it
dishearten
you
for
believe
me
it
will
snow
again
next
year
and
lie
white
and
light
on
the
graves
of
dead
lovers
yesterday
is
dead
and
comes
never
he
drew
very
close
to
katherine
and
whispered
the
end
of
his
sentence
in
her
ear
let
us
live
and
love
katherine
gave
a
little
start
as
she
dropped
from
cloudland
and
looked
at
him
he
drew
back
and
turned
to
the
others
fair
ladies
he
said
shall
we
go
to
the
great
hall
where
the
italian
players
gambol
the
women
gathered
about
him
thanking
him
for
his
song
and
then
fluttered
away
like
brilliant
birds
up
the
steps
to
the
terrace
as
they
did
so
a
figure
in
a
pilgrim
gown
came
from
the
scented
gloom
of
one
of
the
rose
alleys
paused
for
a
moment
as
if
undecided
as
to
his
course
and
then
proceeded
to
cross
the
space
of
moonlit
grass
he
did
not
heed
katherine
standing
in
the
shadow
till
he
almost
touched
her
then
he
glanced
at
her
and
with
a
stifled
exclamation
hurried
past
plunged
into
the
darkness
of
an
opposite
alley
and
disappeared
katherine
gave
a
little
cry
that
was
almost
a
cry
of
fear
and
ran
swiftly
to
where
villon
stood
apart
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
awaiting
her
pleasure
my
lord
she
cried
and
he
turning
swiftly
responded
my
lady
this
masking
kindles
fancies
i
thought
but
now
that
the
eyes
of
thibaut
glared
on
me
from
under
a
pilgrim
hood
villon
frowned
a
villainous
apparition
for
the
news
is
that
he
lies
dead
in
the
camp
of
burgundy
katherine
gave
a
little
shudder
i
always
hated
him
almost
feared
him
if
he
be
dead
i
hope
he
will
not
haunt
me
ah
i
tingle
like
a
lute
that
is
tuned
too
high
let
us
think
of
no
evil
things
villon
responded
will
you
watch
the
players
katherine
shook
her
head
nay
i
am
more
in
a
mood
for
moonlight
than
candlelight
villon
looked
at
her
in
silence
a
silence
of
seconds
that
seemed
to
both
of
them
like
the
silence
of
hours
the
hearts
of
both
were
houses
of
sweet
hopes
and
the
brains
of
both
were
hives
of
happy
thoughts
may
i
ask
you
a
question
villon
said
and
the
girl
answered
surely
are
you
content
with
me
you
have
done
much
i
have
more
to
do
for
seven
days
i
have
wrestled
with
greatness
as
jacob
wrestled
with
the
angels
i
have
made
the
king
popular
the
parisians
loyal
the
army
faithful
then
why
do
you
linger
here
where
courtiers
feast
and
ladies
dance
villon
voice
swelled
proudly
as
he
answered
i
want
the
duke
of
burgundy
to
believe
that
the
king
favourite
is
a
zany
and
the
king
court
an
orgy
where
the
king
honour
melts
like
a
pearl
in
a
pot
of
vinegar
but
our
swords
are
tempered
in
wine
and
sharpened
to
dance
music
and
we
ride
the
girl
sighed
i
would
that
i
were
a
man
that
i
might
ride
with
you
villon
came
close
to
her
and
peered
into
her
eyes
i
ride
in
your
honour
heaven
has
been
very
good
to
me
and
i
serve
france
serving
you
perhaps
i
serve
both
for
the
last
time
for
the
last
time
she
repeated
even
so
my
sweet
lady
echo
those
far
away
lanterns
warn
me
that
i
may
die
some
of
us
will
be
dreaming
our
last
dreams
by
sunrise
i
may
be
one
of
those
heavy
sleepers
why
you
may
die
if
you
ride
on
the
king
business
but
so
may
i
who
sit
at
home
and
eat
my
heart
for
whom
i
will
tell
you
that
villon
touched
her
lightly
on
the
wrist
and
pointed
to
the
grey
tower
on
whose
wall
the
quaint
old
dial
showed
plainly
in
the
bright
moonlight
with
its
wise
latin
inscription
dum
spectas
fugit
hora
carpe
diem
there
is
no
time
like
now
time
that
dial
there
is
as
wise
as
the
wisest
and
he
rapidly
rendered
the
antique
maxim
into
a
running
rhyme
observe
how
fast
time
hurries
past
then
use
each
hour
while
in
your
power
for
comes
the
sun
but
time
flies
on
proceeding
ever
returning
never
katherine
tried
to
laugh
this
was
old
wisdom
when
noah
sailed
the
seas
she
said
and
drew
a
little
apart
from
him
villon
followed
her
well
let
tell
story
i
feel
like
a
happy
child
in
a
world
of
we
are
immortal
you
and
i
wandering
forever
in
this
green
garden
under
those
indifferent
stars
breathing
this
air
spelling
the
secret
of
the
world
you
may
say
what
you
please
she
whispered
but
villon
would
not
have
it
so
alas
no
i
shall
be
mortally
sober
i
am
divinely
with
star
wine
flower
wine
song
wine
the
stars
burn
my
brain
the
roses
pierce
my
flesh
the
songs
trouble
my
soul
if
i
dared
i
would
ease
my
heart
the
girl
spoke
so
faintly
that
only
a
lover
ears
could
hear
the
words
you
may
say
what
you
please
villon
caught
at
his
heart
as
if
to
keep
it
in
the
compass
of
his
breast
if
i
were
to
die
i
would
tell
you
this
i
love
you
these
are
easy
words
to
say
yet
my
heart
fails
as
i
say
them
for
their
meaning
is
as
full
and
musical
as
the
bell
of
doom
men
are
such
fools
that
they
have
but
one
name
for
a
thousand
meanings
and
beggar
the
poor
to
base
kitchen
usages
and
desires
but
i
would
keep
it
holy
for
the
flame
which
it
sometimes
pleases
heaven
to
light
in
one
heart
for
the
worship
of
another
i
never
knew
what
love
was
till
i
saw
a
girl
face
on
a
may
morning
and
wisdom
stripped
the
rind
from
my
naked
heart
the
god
in
me
leaped
into
being
to
greet
the
god
in
your
eyes
i
love
you
this
is
what
i
would
say
if
i
were
to
die
he
was
very
close
to
her
now
and
his
eyes
were
looking
into
her
eyes
she
answered
him
frankly
if
you
were
to
die
i
might
tell
you
this
much
a
woman
may
love
a
man
because
he
is
brave
or
because
he
is
comely
or
because
he
is
wise
or
gentle
for
a
thousand
thousand
reasons
but
the
best
of
all
reasons
for
a
woman
loving
a
man
is
just
because
she
loves
him
without
rhyme
and
without
reason
because
heaven
wills
it
because
earth
fulfils
it
because
his
hand
is
of
the
right
size
to
hold
her
heart
in
its
hollow
the
lovers
hands
were
closely
clasped
the
lovers
lips
were
very
near
to
meeting
only
the
god
pan
smiled
and
sneered
as
if
he
knew
that
sometimes
lovers
lips
fail
to
meet
even
when
the
space
between
fervent
mouth
and
mouth
is
no
bigger
than
a
katherine
villon
whispered
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
love
happiness
life
were
coming
to
his
arms
as
to
a
shrine
in
the
sudden
bliss
that
had
come
upon
both
the
lovers
they
paid
no
heed
to
a
footstep
upon
the
terrace
till
a
voice
struck
like
a
across
their
ecstasy
the
voice
of
noel
le
jolys
where
are
the
lovers
of
yesterday
noel
said
mockingly
as
he
slowly
descended
the
steps
to
join
them
there
was
a
red
rage
in
villon
heart
but
he
bridled
it
as
he
turned
upon
the
interloper
contemptuously
your
pink
and
white
he
said
to
katherine
and
then
waving
his
hand
at
noel
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
and
dismissal
chanted
at
him
fly
away
home
noel
pink
face
flushed
a
poppy
red
and
his
white
hand
went
to
his
sword
hilt
there
was
courage
in
the
foppish
substance
and
he
would
clearly
have
rejoiced
to
try
his
chance
in
a
my
lord
he
said
i
will
measure
word
and
sword
with
you
at
any
season
but
now
i
seek
promised
speech
with
this
lady
villon
laughed
at
his
menace
while
i
have
better
business
in
hand
you
shall
know
only
the
smooth
of
my
tongue
and
the
flat
of
my
falchion
compass
your
swelling
heart
lest
you
play
the
lion
before
a
lady
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
like
angry
dogs
eager
to
spring
at
each
other
throats
katherine
dropped
her
restraining
hand
on
arm
my
lord
she
whispered
he
has
importuned
me
for
audience
i
will
speak
with
you
again
ere
you
ride
villon
turned
to
her
we
ride
at
nine
remember
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
then
in
a
louder
tone
looking
at
noel
he
added
mockingly
till
then
i
shall
busy
myself
in
writing
my
last
will
and
testament
and
bequeathing
a
thousand
nothings
to
a
thousand
nobodies
to
puzzle
posterity
you
shall
taste
of
my
bounty
messire
noel
and
he
began
to
improvise
derisively
to
messire
noel
named
the
neat
by
those
who
love
him
i
bequeath
a
helmless
ship
a
houseless
street
a
wordless
book
a
swordless
sheath
an
hourless
clock
a
leafless
wreath
a
bed
sans
sheet
a
board
sans
meat
a
bell
sans
tongue
a
saw
sans
teeth
to
make
his
nothingness
complete
noel
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
his
back
he
was
very
irate
but
he
was
resolved
to
show
nothing
but
indifference
do
you
leave
me
nothing
katherine
whispered
and
villon
answered
now
and
always
the
heart
of
my
heart
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
glided
into
the
liquid
darkness
of
the
rose
alley
alone
with
exquisite
thoughts
katherine
turned
to
noel
haughtily
well
she
said
i
have
always
to
seek
you
nowadays
noel
protested
katherine
tossed
her
head
and
her
tresses
trembled
like
leaves
in
the
moonlight
the
world
is
not
yet
so
old
that
the
wooing
must
be
done
by
women
i
am
out
of
favour
noel
complained
since
a
fellow
from
nowhere
plays
the
fool
in
high
places
katherine
eyes
showered
scorn
upon
him
i
do
not
hate
you
for
railing
at
him
but
it
does
not
help
me
to
love
you
noel
caught
at
the
word
you
loved
me
once
he
asserted
she
shook
her
head
pityingly
we
played
with
great
words
as
children
play
with
coloured
balls
it
is
easy
to
say
love
you
and
often
very
sweet
yet
the
coloured
balls
roll
into
the
corner
and
the
child
forgets
them
when
the
moon
of
childhood
wanes
a
wistful
irritation
puckered
noel
smooth
countenance
you
have
outgrown
me
he
questioned
katherine
drew
away
from
him
till
the
moonlight
that
shone
between
them
lay
wide
and
white
she
answered
quietly
my
soul
was
in
bud
a
week
ago
it
is
in
blossom
noel
threw
up
his
arms
impatiently
god
have
mercy
what
can
this
fellow
do
that
is
denied
to
me
can
he
stride
a
horse
or
fly
a
hawk
better
show
a
brighter
sword
in
quarrel
or
tune
a
smoother
lute
in
calm
can
he
me
me
me
me
no
no
no
and
must
i
now
believe
that
he
can
me
katherine
weary
of
the
controversy
began
to
ascend
the
steps
to
the
palace
she
spoke
as
she
mounted
when
a
man
comes
to
court
it
is
worth
while
to
be
a
woman
you
will
learn
that
some
day
sir
noel
if
you
grow
to
be
a
man
noel
retorted
it
is
no
great
blazon
to
be
the
favourite
of
a
king
gentlemen
who
brag
little
may
do
much
the
old
love
may
outlast
the
new
katherine
frowned
at
his
mystery
you
speak
like
a
scented
sphinx
but
i
am
too
idle
for
enigmas
farewell
and
she
vanished
into
the
palace
noel
looked
after
her
fretfully
why
are
the
women
all
sunflowers
to
this
scaramouch
he
asked
himself
querulously
well
there
are
other
women
and
a
wise
man
gathers
the
nearest
grapes
a
flagon
and
cup
stood
on
the
table
by
the
marble
seat
noel
poured
himself
out
some
wine
and
drank
it
seeking
consolation
his
duty
called
him
shortly
to
the
service
of
the
king
but
he
lingered
in
the
garden
on
the
chance
of
a
meeting
i
shall
be
revenged
he
said
to
himself
if
my
astrologer
plays
his
part
and
tells
the
weak
king
that
this
lord
of
montcorbier
is
his
evil
spirit
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
events
of
the
past
week
if
katherine
had
been
disdainful
the
girl
huguette
had
been
kind
and
the
golden
scull
had
found
the
dainty
soldier
a
frequent
visitor
it
was
huguette
who
after
listening
to
noel
complaints
of
the
grand
constable
had
suggested
to
him
in
apparent
artlessness
of
heart
that
he
could
play
upon
the
king
superstitions
through
a
new
astrologer
and
had
promised
to
find
him
a
who
would
say
anything
and
everything
that
messire
noel
wished
to
have
said
the
scheme
had
appealed
to
noel
and
this
very
evening
he
expected
huguette
to
bring
the
astrologer
to
him
to
which
end
he
had
entrusted
her
with
a
password
which
would
admit
strangers
into
the
royal
garden
as
he
mused
a
figure
in
a
pilgrim
gown
came
cautiously
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
moonlight
behind
him
and
stood
for
a
moment
watching
him
the
god
pan
could
see
the
face
that
smiled
under
the
pilgrim
hood
a
girl
face
with
bright
eyes
framed
in
golden
hair
but
when
the
girl
saw
noel
she
slipped
a
mask
over
her
face
drew
her
pilgrim
gown
closely
about
her
slim
body
and
lightly
across
the
grass
to
touch
noel
on
the
shoulder
noel
turned
with
a
start
and
faced
as
he
believed
a
masquerading
palmer
may
i
vend
you
a
benevolence
gentleman
huguette
asked
disguising
her
voice
in
an
unfamiliar
gruffness
noel
waved
aside
importunacy
pass
your
ways
pilgrim
i
am
in
no
mood
for
motley
he
turned
away
but
the
persistent
pilgrim
followed
him
are
you
in

a

noel
stopped
impatiently

as
well
as
pilgrim
i
wait
for
a
woman
the
pilgrim
pertinacity
was
not
to
be
baffled
is
she
tall
or
short
young
or
old
dark
or
fair
sweet
or
sour
noel
answered
whimsically
she
is
of
the
colour
of
the
chameleon
of
the
age
of
the
ancient
world
of
the
height
of
any
man
heart
and
as
as
a
crushed
quince
the
girl
pulled
off
her
mask
and
threw
back
her
hood
is
she
of
my
feet
favour
years
and
savour
the
moment
he
saw
her
face
noel
gave
a
cry
of
delight
you
are
welcome
witch
he
shouted
for
you
bring
the
best
love
in
the
world
he
sprang
to
catch
the
girl
in
his
arms
but
she
repulsed
him
gently
hush
i
am
no
now
no
gallantry
girl
but
a
most
politic
plotter
the
world
spins
like
a
potter
wheel
to
shape
the
vessel
of
our
enterprise
we
have
a
wizard
ready
for
your
king
will
louis
come
noel
nodded
decisively
as
linnet
to
he
is
greedy
of
does
your
astrologer
know
his
lesson
he
is
when
all
is
quiet
give
an
owl
cry
thrice
and
a
friend
will
bring
him
he
will
warn
the
king
against
his
grand
constable
he
will
praise
tristan
applaud
olivier
and
commend
messire
noel
le
jolys
noel
chuckled
then
i
shall
be
king
of
the
castle
and
you
shall
have
a
great
gold
chain
and
pearls
as
big
as
a
virgin
tears
noel
did
not
detect
the
scorn
in
huguette
voice
as
she
answered
with
apparent
amiability
you
know
the
way
to
win
a
woman
i
am
no
jingling
i
thank
heaven
noel
cried
i
pay
my
way
he
caught
huguette
in
his
arms
as
he
spoke
and
sought
to
kiss
her
but
she
avoided
him
dexterously
i
will
kiss
you
when
you
win
she
cried
noel
would
have
pushed
his
suit
further
but
at
that
moment
the
great
clock
of
the
palace
chimed
the
and
struck
upon
his
memory
as
well
as
upon
his
ear
he
knew
that
the
king
expected
him
and
he
abandoned
his
reluctantly
you
are
indeed
a
politician
he
sighed
i
must
wait
on
the
king
he
opened
the
door
of
the
tower
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
regretfully
at
the
girl
who
smiled
at
him
temptingly
then
he
passed
in
and
drew
the
door
behind
him
the
moment
he
had
disappeared
the
girl
bearing
changed
her
face
and
gesture
blazoned
a
world
of
contempt
for
her
courtier
lover
fool
dunce
dolt
ass
peacock
buzzard
owl
she
stormed
then
her
rage
faded
and
she
turned
sadly
on
her
heel
as
another
name
came
into
her
heart
and
fluttered
to
her
lips
the
world
is
as
sour
as
a
rotten
orange
since
françois
went
into
exile
her
glance
fell
on
the
lute
which
lay
on
the
marble
seat
where
villon
had
left
it
she
took
it
up
and
began
to
thrum
it
pensively
whispering
to
herself
the
words
of
villon
song
daughters
of
pleasure
one
and
all
of
form
and
features
delicate
she
murmured
to
herself
as
she
did
so
villon
weary
of
wandering
in
the
rose
alleys
came
into
the
moonlit
space
and
saw
the
cloaked
and
hooded
figure
where
it
sat
in
a
moment
his
mind
recalled
the
strange
greetings
he
had
overheard
between
the
two
pilgrims
there
is
another
of
those
pilgrims
he
said
to
himself
determined
now
to
solve
the
mystery
he
crossed
the
grass
quickly
to
the
figure
side
and
saluted
it
hail
little
brother
huguette
leaped
to
her
feet
and
answered
lightly
hail
little
sister
why
little
sister
villon
asked
in
some
astonishment
the
masked
pilgrim
answered
him
smartly
if
i
am
a
brother
of
yours
you
must
need
be
a
sister
of
mine
but
you
talk
out
of
the
litany
what
harm
villon
retorted
if
you
give
me
responses
huguette
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
will
give
you
no
more
than
she
said
and
turned
to
leave
him
but
villon
caught
her
by
the
arm
you
shall
not
show
me
your
heels
till
i
show
myself
your
face
he
insisted
before
the
girl
could
prevent
him
he
had
flung
back
her
hood
and
snatched
the
mask
from
her
face
to
his
amazement
he
found
himself
looking
on
the
fair
familiar
face
of
huguette
and
in
astonishment
he
cried
her
name
the
girl
astounded
at
being
recognized
came
close
to
him
who
are
you
she
asked
for
answer
villon
unmasked
huguette
looked
closely
into
his
face
at
first
without
any
sign
of
recognition
then
suddenly
the
knowledge
came
to
her
and
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
with
a
cry
of
joy
françois
you
dear
devil
where
have
you
been
this
thousand
years
they
said
you
were
banished
how
brave
you
are
where
did
you
steal
so
much
splendour
are
you
cutting
purses
are
you
plucking
mantles
villon
tried
to
stay
her
questions
what
are
you
doing
here
abbess
the
fair
fool
noel
has
taken
a
fancy
to
me
and
i
am
making
an
fool
of
him
kiss
me
she
urged
putting
her
face
very
near
to
villon
villon
drew
back
his
head
you
should
keep
your
kisses
for
the
fair
fool
noel
huguette
drew
away
from
him
angrily
when
you
were
as
lean
as
a
cat
and
as
ragged
as
a
sparrow
you
were
not
so
nice
a
precisian
has
some
great
lady
bewitched
you
can
you
only
woo
in
silk
and
win
in
velvet
if
the
kernel
be
sweet
what
does
the
husk
matter
heaven
pity
why
should
a
woman
love
you
villon
took
no
notice
of
her
petulance
but
repeated
his
question
what
are
you
doing
here
abbess
the
girl
rage
was
as
short
as
a
summer
shower
she
turned
again
to
him
fondling
him
well
i
can
not
shut
the
door
of
my
heart
in
your
smooth
face
ren
de
montigny
has
a
great
game
afoot
and
you
are
back
in
time
to
share
in
it
what
game
villon
asked
huguette
answered
the
fair
fool
noel
advised
by
me
has
persuaded
the
king
to
see
an
astrologer
here
when
the
gardens
are
quiet
noel
believes
that
the
astrologer
will
advise
the
king
to
fling
his
grand
constable
out
of
the
window
and
call
messire
noel
in
at
the
door
but
the
comrades
of
the
cockleshell
really
mean
much
more
mischief
when
once
we
get
the
king
within
reach
of
our
fingers
we
mean
to
snap
him
up
and
carry
him
out
of
paris
willy
nilly
and
sell
him
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
villon
caught
his
breath
a
great
game
he
cried
but
who
is
this
astrologer
thibaut
she
answered
who
pretends
to
be
dead
but
who
lives
for
this
revenge
villon
leaped
to
his
feet
he
remembered
what
katherine
thought
she
had
seen
then
it
was
he
he
said
huguette
went
on
with
her
story
noel
is
to
give
us
the
signal
by
crying
an
owl
cry
thrice
villon
was
revolving
many
thoughts
in
his
mind
and
he
hardly
heeded
her
this
adventure
of
the
astrologer
might
be
turned
to
my
advantage
here
is
a
chance
in
a
thousand
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
paced
restlessly
on
the
grass
i
have
but
to
close
my
eyes
and
shut
my
ears
and
the
good
thibaut
carries
the
good
louis
to
the
good
burgundy
and
there
can
be
no
hanging
the
girl
followed
after
him
catching
at
his
sleeve
to
stay
him
what
are
you
talking
about
villon
went
on
unheeding
her
whispering
to
himself
if
they
cut
gaffer
louis
throat
between
them
the
world
were
rid
of
a
king
and
i
free
to
win
katherine
hold
paris
be
the
first
man
in
france
françois
speak
to
me
huguette
pleaded
but
she
pleaded
in
vain
one
would
say
i
were
a
fool
to
let
such
occasion
slip
through
my
ten
commandments
but
i
have
learned
a
thing
called
honour
which
i
must
not
lose
for
the
sake
of
my
lady
huguette
flung
herself
in
front
of
him
and
stopped
his
restless
walk
françois
françois
yes
child
yes
what
does
it
matter
to
you
what
they
do
with
the
fool
king
abbess
i
must
have
a
finger
in
this
pie
abbess
for
the
old
sake
sake
will
you
keep
me
a
secret
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
lovingly
i
will
always
do
your
bidding
i
have
a
mind
to
play
my
part
in
this
enterprise
i
am
the
king
of
the
cockleshells
and
i
have
returned
to
authority
give
me
your
pilgrim
gown
girl
and
mind
not
a
word
to
the
brotherhood
i
want
to
take
friend
thibaut
by
surprise
as
he
spoke
he
pulled
off
the
pilgrim
gown
and
huguette
stood
before
him
in
her
familiar
boy
dress
of
green
hide
among
the
roses
until
the
sport
begins
he
cried
the
girl
flung
her
arms
about
him
dear
françois
she
cried
and
then
ran
swiftly
away
from
him
and
disappeared
into
the
night
villon
looked
after
the
girl
as
she
ran
the
girl
is
as
fleet
as
a
hare
and
as
wild
witted
he
said
to
himself
then
he
flung
huguette
from
his
thoughts
and
faced
the
great
problem
how
does
the
balance
go
he
asked
himself
and
he
weighed
the
air
with
his
hands
as
if
their
cups
held
the
precious
things
he
spoke
of
in
the
one
hand
a
great
king
life
in
the
other
a
poor
honour
king
beggar
beggar
king
he
paused
a
moment
looking
down
the
long
lane
of
infinite
possibilities
he
owed
nothing
to
louis
after
all
louis
had
made
him
the
plaything
of
a
shameless
trick
had
thrust
honour
upon
him
in
mockery
had
tantalized
him
with
a
dream
of
a
dream
ere
another
sunset
if
a
woman
heart
were
not
his
for
the
winning
he
would
be
swinging
grisly
enough
with
his
tongue
through
his
teeth
and
the
ravens
wheeling
about
his
ears
upon
the
paris
gallows
it
was
but
to
let
thibaut
play
out
his
play
and
snare
the
old
black
fox
and
then
villon
had
paris
to
himself
was
absolved
from
all
penalty
might
in
the
light
of
the
new
love
the
people
had
for
him
do
or
at
least
try
to
do
pretty
much
as
he
pleased
with
the
kingless
kingdom
it
was
a
dazzling
prospect
why
not
he
asked
himself
then
in
a
moment
the
reasons
why
not
rose
up
against
him
not
to
be
cheated
not
to
be
banished
he
had
given
his
word
he
had
sworn
fealty
to
the
fantastic
monarch
who
had
played
with
him
and
to
whom
he
owed
at
least
the
realization
of
great
dreams
and
the
golden
chance
of
winning
his
heart
desire
he
had
given
his
word
that
would
not
have
meant
much
to
him
eight
days
ago
when
he
lived
in
a
sick
atmosphere
of
lies
and
dodges
and
tricks
and
meannesses
where
the
lips
were
as
ready
to
deceive
as
the
fingers
to
filch
and
where
a
successful
falsehood
was
almost
as
much
applauded
as
a
successful
theft
but
now
as
he
had
said
he
had
learned
a
thing
called
honour
the
whole
meaning
of
life
had
been
changed
for
him
in
the
sunshine
of
a
fair
girl
favour
and
what
was
but
yesterday
possible
probable
even
pleasant
was
surely
impossible
he
murmured
her
name
to
himself
katherine
as
a
charm
against
horrible
temptation
and
his
heart
strengthened
under
the
spell
he
turned
to
enter
the
tower
but
as
he
did
so
the
tower
door
was
pushed
out
against
him
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
noel
le
jolys
noel
started
in
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
his
rival
but
villon
caught
him
by
the
wrist
the
poor
popinjay
was
too
brave
a
bird
to
be
thibaut
messire
noel
he
said
i
have
a
word
to
say
in
your
ear
and
he
drew
him
inside
the
tower
and
stood
with
him
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
whispering
speech
that
made
noel
pulse
beat
fast
then
villon
left
him
and
sped
swiftly
up
the
winding
stairs
that
led
to
the
king
room
while
noel
left
alone
pushed
open
the
door
again
and
passed
out
into
the
garden
his
head
dizzy
with
strange
news
placing
his
hands
like
a
shell
about
his
mouth
he
gave
the
cry
of
an
owl
three
times
with
a
little
interval
between
each
cry
and
then
softly
withdrew
again
into
the
tower
and
in
his
turn
raced
with
a
throbbing
heart
up
the
narrow
steps
that
led
to
the
king
chamber
chapter
x
under
which
king
the
rose
garden
seemed
to
be
as
quiet
as
a
no
sound
was
heard
save
the
faint
soughing
of
the
evening
wind
among
the
rose
bushes
no
sight
resembling
humanity
visible
save
the
face
of
pan
looking
down
mockingly
upon
the
crimson
blossoms
that
girdled
him
yet
in
a
few
seconds
it
became
plain
that
the
god
pan
was
not
the
only
occupant
of
the
garden
through
quiet
alleyways
cloaked
and
cowled
figures
came
stealing
six
in
number
men
with
cloaks
about
their
shoulders
and
pilgrims
hoods
upon
their
heads
men
who
carried
cockleshells
upon
the
sleeves
of
their
gabardines
all
converging
through
the
dark
walks
of
the
garden
to
a
common
centre
and
that
centre
the
grassy
space
before
the
watch
tower
the
six
figures
huddled
together
at
the
base
of
the
image
of
pan
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
their
leader
a
man
of
giant
form
spoke
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
thibaut
are
we
all
here
he
asked
the
nearest
pilgrim
to
him
answered
with
the
voice
of
rené
de
montigny
aye
and
ready
to
gather
the
royal
rose
of
this
garden
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
faint
click
at
the
latch
of
the
tower
door
thibaut
waved
his
companions
apart
keep
close
he
said
and
four
of
the
pilgrim
forms
disappeared
swiftly
into
the
spaces
of
shadow
only
thibaut
and
rené
remained
standing
masked
and
attentive
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tower
door
it
opened
and
noel
le
jolys
emerged
followed
by
the
slight
hunched
figure
in
faded
black
velvet
for
whom
the
eyes
of
the
conspirators
were
so
eager
noel
advanced
questioning
is
the
here
rené
de
montigny
answered
him
glibly
as
a
showman
patters
the
praise
of
his
wares
aye
he
is
the
wonder
of
the
world
he
can
read
the
stars
more
easily
than
a
tapster
the
score
on
his
shutter
he
can
spell
you
the
high
luck
and
the
low
bohemian
egyptian
arabian
wisdom
have
no
mysteries
for
him
as
rené
ceased
the
royal
figure
with
a
sweeping
gesture
of
his
hand
made
a
sign
of
dismissal
to
noel
who
bowed
respectfully
and
withdrew
into
the
tower
the
king
then
beckoned
to
the
mighty
figure
in
the
palmer
weed
and
thibaut
advanced
slowly
until
he
was
within
touch
of
his
prey
when
he
suddenly
flung
out
his
great
hand
and
caught
his
enemy
by
the
throat
gripping
him
into
silence
while
his
right
hand
bared
and
brandished
a
dagger
the
figure
in
black
dropped
under
his
grasp
trembled
and
gasped
but
the
hand
of
thibaut
was
too
strong
upon
him
and
he
could
not
speak
or
cry
out
thibaut
hissed
at
him
sire
i
can
decipher
your
destiny
do
not
speak
or
i
will
kill
you
he
pressed
the
point
of
the
dagger
close
to
the
captive
neck
and
smiled
to
see
him
shudder
i
am
thibaut
sire
whom
you
thought
to
be
dead
but
who
lives
to
prison
you
as
he
spoke
his
companions
emerged
from
the
gloom
and
gathered
around
thibaut
and
the
king
a
little
menacing
circle
of
determined
men
you
are
in
the
toils
silent
you
are
still
a
man
give
tongue
and
you
are
simple
carrion
you
must
come
to
the
knees
of
burgundy
you
shall
be
the
duke
footstool
the
cowering
black
figure
wriggled
and
quivered
as
if
every
one
of
thibaut
words
were
a
stroke
of
a
whip
that
cut
into
his
flesh
his
eager
hands
clawed
piteously
at
thibaut
grasping
arm
until
his
very
agony
of
terror
aroused
the
contempt
of
his
captor
he
pushed
the
king
from
him
contemptuously
and
the
king
dropped
on
the
ground
a
black
and
helpless
heap
of
fear
can
a
king
be
such
a
cur
burgundy
wo
hurt
you
if
you
do
as
he
bids
you
i
wo
hurt
you
if
you
do
as
i
bid
you
the
black
figure
rocked
a
pitiable
bundle
of
terrors
apparently
sobbing
plaintively
thibaut
sickened
at
such
shameless
fear
stop
crying
he
growled
rené
de
montigny
who
had
been
watching
keenly
the
actions
of
the
prisoner
interrupted
he
seems
to
be
laughing
he
said
thibaut
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
stooped
down
over
the
prostrate
man
who
greeted
him
with
a
prolonged
and
hearty
peal
of
laughter
which
staggered
the
giant
like
a
blow
in
the
face
at
that
moment
the
tower
door
was
flung
open
and
tristan
appeared
the
king
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
in
another
moment
as
if
by
magic
the
little
garden
space
was
girdled
by
the
archers
of
the
scottish
guard
strong
hands
made
sure
of
the
baffled
conspirators
and
to
their
astonishment
louis
himself
made
his
appearance
through
the
open
doorway
his
malign
face
smiling
in
the
moonlight
chapter
xi
the
death
of
a
wanton
the
sham
king
leaped
to
his
feet
still
laughing
flung
off
the
black
cap
with
its
little
row
of
leaden
saints
and
the
rusty
black
mantle
which
mimicked
the
king
habit
and
stood
delighted
and
defiant
before
thibaut
the
françois
villon
who
thus
a
second
time
had
crossed
his
path
well
friend
what
has
the
wizard
told
you
louis
asked
blandly
villon
swayed
with
laughter
as
he
pointed
to
the
bewildered
giant
wonders
sire
he
answered
i
have
not
laughed
so
heartily
since
i
attained
greatness
but
even
as
he
spoke
thibaut
had
recovered
his
wits
he
might
be
defeated
but
he
would
not
be
unavenged
you
shall
laugh
no
more
he
shouted
wrenching
himself
free
from
restraint
and
he
sprang
at
his
enemy
with
lifted
dagger
from
behind
the
shadow
of
the
statue
of
pan
there
came
a
warning
shriek
and
swiftly
between
villon
and
thibaut
a
slim
green
figure
darted
and
slim
green
arms
clasped
villon
around
the
neck
the
dagger
of
thibaut
drove
deep
into
the
soft
body
of
huguette
with
a
curse
thibaut
turned
and
sweeping
aside
the
archers
who
tried
to
stop
him
disappeared
down
the
nearest
alley
noel
le
jolys
drawing
his
sword
rushed
in
pursuit
followed
by
several
soldiers
villon
held
the
bleeding
body
of
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
tried
his
best
to
stanch
the
wound
which
was
staining
the
green
jerkin
a
dull
red
but
the
girl
protested
faintly
pushing
his
ministering
hand
away
let
me
alone
i
am
done
for
she
gasped
olivier
was
by
her
side
in
an
instant
eyeing
the
wound
with
the
professional
interest
of
the
and
looking
from
it
to
the
girl
pale
face
villon
gaze
questioned
him
olivier
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
villon
knew
that
the
wound
was
mortal
and
his
own
blood
seemed
like
water
within
him
he
carried
the
girl
across
the
grass
to
the
marble
seat
and
rested
her
on
it
the
red
stain
on
the
green
coat
growing
wider
and
wider
as
they
moved
courage
abbess
courage
lass
he
whispered
fighting
with
his
horror
and
his
sorrow
as
he
moaned
to
himself
that
any
one
should
die
for
me
the
girl
arms
clung
closer
about
his
neck
and
her
lips
moved
faintly
he
stooped
close
to
her
to
catch
her
words
this
is
a
strange
end
françois
i
always
thought
i
should
die
in
a
bed
here
is
another
kind
of
battlefield
give
me
drink
some
water
villon
cried
to
olivier
who
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
pair
with
the
resigned
look
of
the
physician
who
knows
that
his
art
is
of
no
avail
huguette
protested
faintly
not
water
wine
i
have
ever
loved
the
taste
of
it
and
is
too
late
to
change
now
olivier
filled
a
cup
from
the
flagon
on
the
table
and
was
for
lifting
it
to
the
girl
lips
but
her
feeble
hand
repulsed
him
and
she
pleaded
to
villon
give
it
to
me
françois
villon
took
the
cup
from
the
barber
hand
lifted
it
to
the
dying
girl
lips
and
she
drank
greedily
the
strong
wine
gave
her
for
a
moment
something
of
its
own
false
strength
and
she
struggled
to
her
feet
villon
rising
with
her
and
supporting
her
your
health
françois
i
suppose
i
have
been
a
great
sinner
will
god
forgive
me
villon
stifled
a
heavy
groan
but
he
was
sworn
to
console
her
if
he
could
and
indeed
he
believed
his
words
of
consolation
he
understands
his
children
the
heavy
head
drooped
its
golden
curls
upon
his
shoulder
you
always
were
hopeful
she
said
brokenly
then
suddenly
clasping
him
tightly
she
cried
many
men
have
taken
my
body
only
you
ever
took
my
heart
give
me
your
lips
villon
spirit
was
troubled
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
lips
were
bound
to
wait
for
that
kiss
of
his
lady
and
yet
the
dying
girl
loved
him
and
he
had
loved
the
dying
girl
after
a
fashion
and
he
could
not
refuse
her
now
he
bent
to
grant
her
prayer
when
suddenly
she
shook
herself
free
from
his
arms
and
began
to
sing
faintly
the
words
of
the
song
he
had
made
for
her
daughters
of
pleasure
one
and
all
then
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
sob
and
slipped
to
the
last
lines
of
the
verse
use
your
red
lips
before
too
late
love
ere
love
flies
beyond
recall
she
shook
her
head
back
in
a
wild
peal
of
laughter
then
she
gave
a
great
cry
and
fell
forward
villon
caught
her
looked
in
her
face
and
knew
that
she
was
dead
and
that
the
best
of
his
old
bad
life
lay
dead
with
her
olivier
in
obedience
to
an
order
of
the
king
gave
a
signal
and
the
girl
body
was
swiftly
wrapped
in
a
soldier
cloak
and
laid
gently
upon
a
pair
of
crossed
halberds
as
this
was
being
done
noel
le
jolys
came
panting
back
with
a
red
sword
in
his
hand
thibaut
is
dead
sire
he
said
my
hand
was
the
hand
that
finished
him
then
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
dead
body
they
shone
with
sudden
tears
villon
went
up
to
him
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
i
leave
this
dead
woman
in
your
hands
he
said
for
i
think
you
had
a
kindness
for
her
see
that
she
has
christian
burial
noel
bowed
his
head
and
followed
in
silence
the
girl
body
the
garden
was
left
to
louis
and
villon
tristan
and
olivier
and
the
handful
of
captured
rogues
who
stood
apart
strongly
guarded
and
stripped
of
their
pilgrims
garb
gazing
amazed
at
louis
and
his
double
villon
silent
too
looked
after
the
little
group
that
bore
away
the
dead
girl
body
his
mind
was
a
warfare
of
wild
memories
strange
recollections
of
times
and
places
with
huguette
came
crowding
up
and
beating
piteously
upon
his
brain
he
thought
of
what
he
had
been
and
groaned
of
what
he
was
now
and
his
soul
cried
out
as
in
prayer
in
the
name
of
katherine
chapter
xii
a
virgin
tears
the
king
hand
fell
upon
his
shoulder
and
shattered
his
meditations
are
you
so
dashed
by
the
death
of
a
wanton
the
king
asked
mockingly
villon
turned
upon
him
in
a
noble
rage
she
had
god
breath
in
her
body
sire
he
said
then
drawing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
if
to
dissipate
the
sad
fancies
that
oppressed
him
he
went
on
i
have
been
for
the
moment
sire
now
i
am
again
the
hour
for
battle
is
at
hand
louis
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
done
me
a
good
turn
gossip
he
said
and
may
ask
any
grace
of
me
except
your
life
that
depends
on
your
lady
villon
looked
over
at
the
corner
where
his
old
boon
companions
were
huddled
together
the
miserable
centre
of
a
circle
of
soldiers
sire
he
said
grant
me
the
lives
of
those
rascals
they
shall
ride
with
me
and
fight
for
france
it
is
better
than
making
them
play
on
the
evil
tree
the
king
whispered
a
few
words
to
tristan
and
tristan
very
reluctantly
gave
the
order
of
liberation
the
comrades
of
the
cockleshell
were
freed
of
their
bonds
and
bade
to
stand
apart
under
guard
and
out
of
earshot
to
wait
on
destiny
for
future
commands
at
this
moment
louis
glancing
upwards
caught
sight
between
the
flower
vases
on
the
terrace
of
a
gleam
of
crimson
the
crimson
silk
of
a
woman
robe
it
betrayed
the
presence
of
katherine
de
vaucelles
who
had
come
hard
upon
the
hour
of
nine
to
seek
for
her
lover
but
who
paused
irresolute
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
noting
the
presence
of
the
king
louis
beckoned
to
her
amicably
and
she
began
slowly
to
descend
the
staircase
louis
came
over
to
villon
and
whispered
in
his
ear
here
comes
your
lady
i
think
your
is
ripe
and
you
need
not
stand
on
to
pick
it
villon
answered
him
with
burning
eyes
sire
i
believe
i
have
won
the
rose
of
the
world
louis
chuckled
like
an
enraptured
raven
the
count
of
montcorbier
is
luckier
than
françois
villon
but
the
lady
has
a
high
mind
and
a
fierce
spirit
she
may
not
relish
the
deception
pardon
the
cheat
his
lie
something
in
the
king
words
struck
upon
villon
fiery
hopes
like
a
stream
of
water
and
seemed
to
quench
them
he
was
like
a
man
who
long
playing
at
suddenly
has
the
bandage
plucked
from
his
eyes
and
stands
dazzled
and
blinking
in
the
sunlight
after
all
he
was
not
the
count
of
montcorbier
after
all
he
was
not
the
grand
constable
of
france
after
all
he
was
only
a
masquerading
beggar
who
had
won
the
heart
of
a
lady
under
false
colours
who
had
triumphed
by
flying
a
false
flag
in
all
those
seven
splendid
days
this
simple
thought
had
never
come
to
him
his
whole
soul
had
been
so
taken
captive
by
the
fascination
of
the
part
he
had
been
permitted
to
play
that
he
forgot
he
was
playing
a
part
and
allowed
his
fancy
to
believe
that
a
dream
would
endure
forever
now
he
knew
himself
and
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
must
do
a
divine
farce
had
turned
to
sudden
tragedy
he
turned
to
the
king
with
a
groan
cheat
lie
he
repeated
sire
those
words
fling
me
from
my
fool
paradise
kill
me
if
i
fail
to
win
her
but
i
will
tear
this
mask
from
my
face
this
falsehood
from
my
heart
louis
grinned
at
him
please
yourself
win
her
or
swing
either
way
contents
me
as
he
spoke
he
turned
away
katherine
had
descended
the
steps
and
was
moving
across
the
grass
to
greet
her
hero
who
stood
with
clasped
hands
in
the
moonlight
like
a
man
struck
dumb
katherine
was
carrying
in
her
hands
a
crimson
scarf
fringed
with
gold
and
she
lifted
it
to
him
as
she
spoke
wear
this
with
my
prayers
with
it
i
give
you
my
hand
and
heart
you
shall
carry
my
plighted
troth
with
you
into
the
battle
let
me
tell
my
love
to
all
the
world
swiftly
and
lightly
she
threw
it
about
his
neck
before
he
could
find
words
but
now
he
spoke
wait
wait
you
must
say
no
more
until
you
know
me
the
girl
eyes
widened
with
surprise
do
i
not
know
you
villon
thrust
his
face
forward
very
close
to
hers
look
into
my
face
he
said
look
well
do
you
see
nothing
there
that
reminds
you
of
other
hours
katherine
smiled
divinely
of
happy
hours
in
this
rose
garden
villon
insisted
fiercely
no
no
of
a
dark
night
a
tavern
a
cloaked
woman
a
sordid
fellow
dreaming
sottishly
by
the
fire
a
prayer
a
and
a
promise
a
crowd
of
bullies
and
wantons
a
quarrel
a
fight
with
sword
and
lantern
in
the
dark
a
breast
knot
of
ribbon
flung
from
a
gallery
katherine
recoiled
a
little
with
a
horror
in
her
eyes
what
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
she
asked
villon
dropped
on
his
knees
with
a
groan
here
is
the
knot
of
ribbon
which
you
flung
to
me
in
the
fircone
tavern
oh
pity
me
i
am
françois
villon
katherine
pressed
her
hands
to
her
forehead
i
can
hear
what
you
say
but
it
makes
no
mark
on
my
brain
villon
words
ran
fast
from
him
i
am
françois
villon
and
yet
no
longer
he
for
my
old
evil
self
is
dead
i
am
françois
villon
who
served
you
with
his
sword
who
praised
you
with
his
pen
and
who
loves
you
with
all
his
soul
the
girl
whole
body
shook
with
fear
as
she
answered
it
is
true
it
is
true
i
do
believe
you
villon
sprang
to
his
feet
whatever
my
fate
is
he
cried
you
shall
know
the
truth
turning
to
where
the
released
conspirators
stood
apart
he
called
to
them
peremptorily
guy
eene
all
of
you
come
here
amazed
to
be
thus
summoned
in
their
own
names
by
so
great
a
personage
as
the
grand
constable
of
france
the
thieves
crept
forward
timidly
and
in
obedience
to
villon
commanding
gestures
gathered
about
him
as
he
turned
to
them
pressing
his
face
near
to
their
faces
and
cried
look
at
me
closer
closer
do
you
know
françois
villon
in
spite
of
this
new
spirit
shining
in
his
eyes
rené
de
montigny
gave
a
cry
of
recognition
i
should
never
have
known
you
you
are
so
strangely
changed
guy
tabarie
endorsed
him
still
is
his
dear
old
countenance
katherine
watching
the
scene
in
sick
despair
turned
piteously
to
the
king
sire
sire
is
this
true
louis
who
had
been
watching
all
with
unmitigated
satisfaction
answered
fleeringly
most
true
pretty
mistress
you
disdained
me
for
this
with
blazing
eyes
and
trembling
hands
katherine
moved
across
the
grass
to
where
villon
stood
pitiful
traitor
why
did
you
live
this
lie
villon
pleaded
desperately
i
loved
you
katherine
anger
flamed
into
a
great
fire
do
not
shame
the
sweet
word
i
hate
you
to
think
the
face
that
i
have
learned
to
love
should
mask
so
base
a
heart
then
as
villon
drew
a
little
closer
to
her
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
she
struck
out
at
him
with
both
hands
beating
him
on
the
breast
in
an
unconquerable
fury
villon
bowed
beneath
the
blow
while
she
raged
at
him
you
have
stolen
my
love
like
a
thief
you
have
crucified
my
pride
i
hate
you
go
back
to
the
dregs
and
lees
of
life
skulk
in
your
tavern
forget
what
i
shall
never
forget
that
so
base
a
thing
as
you
ever
came
near
me
the
king
was
by
her
side
in
an
instant
and
whispering
into
her
ear
is
this
the
course
of
true
love
she
swung
upon
him
in
scorn
sire
you
have
wreaked
a
royal
revenge
upon
a
woman
there
are
no
tears
in
my
eyes
yet
but
i
pray
they
will
come
that
i
may
weep
myself
clean
of
this
memory
with
clasped
hands
and
set
lips
she
moved
away
from
louis
and
stood
apart
in
the
moonlight
a
fixed
and
rigid
figure
of
despair
louis
stepped
to
where
villon
stood
in
stricken
anguish
and
whispered
to
him
i
am
afraid
you
will
hang
master
villon
villon
threw
back
his
head
defiantly
i
should
be
glad
to
greet
the
gallows
now
but
i
have
a
deed
to
do
before
i
die
as
he
spoke
the
great
bell
of
the
palace
beat
out
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
of
nine
it
roused
the
wounded
spirit
in
his
soul
he
moved
to
where

i
dreamed
that
love
through
which
i
have
been
born
again
could
lift
me
to
your
lips
the
dream
is
over
but
you
bade
me
serve

and
i
ride
and
fight
for
you
while

came
from

with

the

on

brought
the
armour
of
the

constable
and
began
to
buckle
it
upon
him
while
this
was
being
done
he
turned
and
spoke
to
his
comrades
let
each
man
carry
himself
as
if
the
fate
of

depended
upon
his

his

his
voice
quailed
and
almost
failed
him
there
were
happy
men
there
no
doubt
whom
women
loved
but
he
rallied
in
a
breath
and
his
voice
rang
out
valiantly
again
forward
in

name
and
the
king
and
every
soldier
present
echoed
him
forward

the
rede
of
five
riding
rogues
through
the
silent
streets
of

a
slender
line
of
steel
moved
slowly
the
thread
of
which
master
françois
villon
was
the
needle
pricked
to
sew
the

france
together
the

at

rode
the
five
released

beneath

breaths
as
they
rode
for
the
order
to
keep
silence
did
not
count
until
the

were

forth

swinging
at

every

his

pulsing
with
rare
emotions
and
his

busy
with
strange
thoughts
rené
de
montigny
spoke
first
the
thing
that
filled
his
mind
it
must
be
a
devil
of
a
business
he
reflected
to
be
bullied
like
that
by
a
beauty
blood
but
she
is
beautiful
and
blood
but
she
can
bellow
guy
tabarie
chuckled
fatly
i
have
been
bullied
so
many
times
by
drabs
that
i
would
take
my
trouncing
patiently
from
such
a
pair
of
lips
it
was
meat
and
drink
to
look
at
her
and
think
thoughts
jehan
le
loup
frowned
sourly
had
i
been
master
françois
and
black
louis
not
been
by
i
should
have
tried
to
mend
my
luck
with
a
cudgel
at
best
and
worst
she
would
have
had
something
to
curse
for
after
a
lusty
thumping
casin
cholet
licked
his
lips
i
shall
think
of
her
he
said
when
next
i
meet
with
a
sweetheart
with
a
little
wit
your
honest
rascal
can
be
as
happy
as
a

in

dark
all
fur
is

oolin
de

yawned
what
are
we
going
for
he
questioned
i
would
sooner
have
stayed
in
the
king
rose
garden
and
filled
my
belly
as
we
did
last
week
when
the
great
lord
in
gold
tissue
pitied
us
and
to
think
that
it
was
no
more
than
françois
after
all
i
could
jam
my
dagger
between
his
for
making
such
a
ninny
of
me
i
knew
him
all
the
time
guy
tabarie
was
beginning
when
rené
de
montigny
silenced
him
with
a
ringing
clip
on
the
nearest
ear
which
nearly
unsaddled
the
fat
rogue
you
lie
mountain
you
lie
he
whispered
do
you
think
that
if
he
cheated
me
your
pig
eyes
could
read
the
riddle
no
no
he
fooled
us
fairly
and
he
fooled
us
well
but
he
treated
us
kindly
and
we
can
afford
to
cry
quits
a
strange
thing
mused
colin
that
a
trifle
of
hair
less
on
a
man
chin
and
a
trifle
of
dirt
less
on
a
man
cheek
with
some
matter
of
clean
linen
and
a
smooth
jerkin
can
make
such
a
difference
not
at
all
said
rené
de
montigny
we
are
all
the
same
at
the
core
every
and
of
us
hungering
thirsting
lusting
just
after
the
same
fashion
is
only
the
coat
that
counts
is
you
who
lie
now
grunted
tabarie
there
no
gold
tissue
in
the
world
that
would
make
you
as
cunning
as
françois
you
would
never
have
done
as
he
did
if
the
king
had
made
you
the
pick
of
the
litter
rend
whistled
through
his
teeth
may
be
so
may
be
not
he
said
no
man
can
tell
what
he
may
do
till
he
is
given
his
chance
to
test
his
mettle
oh
opportunity
golden
opportunity
if
i
were
françois
villon
i
would
shape
an
image
of
gold
in
your
name
and
praise
you
for
a
saint
i
wonder
what
that
girl
will
say
mused
tabarie
if
our
françois
comes
back
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
in
his
pocket
i
wonder
what
she
will
say
sneered
jehan
le
loup
if
he
trundles
back
feet
foremost
with
a
hole
in
his
body
and
half
a
head
whatever
happens
is
sure
to
vex
her
said
casin
cholet
women
are
made
that
way
our
poor
minions
will
be
lonely
said
colin
i
doubt
it
said
rené
de
montigny
drily
and
then
he
sighed
a
little
poor
abbess
sudden
tears
smeared
tabarie
fat
cheeks
she
was
a
brave
wench
if
ever
he
snivelled
through
wellfare
or
illfare
she
was
always
the
same
and
would
share
board
and
blanket
with
a
friend
though
his
pouch
were
as
barren
as
sarah
body
it
was
ten
thousand
pities
said
eene
that
she
fell
so
for
françois
did
he
give
her
some
philtre
some
elixir
do
you
think
françois
is
a
fine
fellow
though
i
not
deny
it
but
had
the
devil
own
luck
and
by
our
patron
nicholas
there
be
others
as
fine
as
he
as
he
spoke
the
great
gate
of
the
city
yawned
noiselessly
and
stealthy
and
silent
the
hope
of
paris
glided
into
the
darkness
and
was
swallowed
up
by
the
night
chapter
xiv
the
banners
of
burgundy
the
yellow
dawn
rippling
over
paris
found
her
streets
strangely
silent
strangely
quiet
a
few
good
citizens
were
abed
but
most
good
citizens
were
abroad
on
that
kindly
june
morning
for
there
was
business
doing
outside
the
walls
of
paris
which
tempted
every
man
inside
the
walls
to
those
walls
and
that
business
was
the
battle
that
was
raging
and
had
raged
since
nightfall
between
the
troops
of
king
louis
on
one
side
under
the
grand
constable
of
france
and
the
troops
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
his
allies
on
the
other
paris
might
have
been
that
strange
city
of
slumber
told
of
by
the
wanderer
in
the
arabian
tale
or
that
poppied
palace
where
the
sleeping
beauty
and
her
court
lay
waiting
the
coming
of
the
hero
if
asmodeus
whisking
his
way
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
with
any
astonished
travelling
companion
in
tow
had
paused
over
paris
and
unroofed
it
for
the
benefit
of
his
most
of
the
rooms
would
have
been
found
as
empty
as
the
streets
but
there
was
one
spot
in
the
city
an
open
place
by
the
river
between
an
ancient
gate
and
the
church
of
the
celestins
which
was
alive
and
busy
with
a
strange
activity
of
its
own
it
was
empty
enough
and
the
windows
of
its
houses
stared
vacantly
upon
its
emptiness
but
there
were
two
men
in
possession
of
its
tranquillity
who
had
been
toiling
hard
at
a
singular
piece
of
work
they
were
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
erection
of
a
tall
gaunt
gallows
with
its
steps
and
platform
which
occupied
a
space
midway
between
the
gateway
and
the
grey
old
gothic
church
in
curious
contrast
to
the
sinister
grimness
of
the
gibbet
there
rose
opposite
to
it
on
the
side
of
the
church
a
dais
richly
draped
with
royal
velvet
splendidly
spangled
with
and
brave
with
armourial
bearings
the
two
men
who
were
working
at
the
gallows
having
finished
their
job
came
out
into
the
open
space
and
stretched
themselves
one
was
a
tall
thin
grave
of
a
man
clad
in
clothes
and
conspicuous
for
a
long
rosary
of
enormous
beads
which
he
carried
around
his
neck
and
which
from
time
to
time
he
handled
with
ostentatious
sanctimony
the
other
was
as
complete
a
contrast
to
his
companion
as
could
be
desired
by
the
humorous
painter
he
was
a
plump
spry
little
fellow
brightly
dressed
and
bubbling
over
with
merry
roguish
spirits
which
formed
the
most
fantastic
foil
to
the
lugubriousness
of
his
any
good
citizen
of
paris
arising
belated
if
any
such
there
may
have
been
and
hurrying
to
the
walls
to
know
how
things
went
for
the
king
cause
would
have
recognized
readily
enough
in
these
two
strange
opposites
two
of
the
most
dreaded
of
the
myrmidons
of
tristan
no
less
than
his
two
chief
hangmen
and
was
the
long
cadaverous
hangman
was
the
stout
droll
hangman
but
when
it
came
to
a
push
and
a
pinch
both
were
hangmen
and
hung
in
the
same
manner
if
not
with
the
same
manners
pulled
a
flagon
of
wine
from
under
the
platform
of
the
gallows
lifted
it
to
his
lips
drained
a
mighty
draught
sighed
with
satisfaction
and
held
out
the
bottle
to
his
brother
craftsman
drink
and
be
merry
making
gestures
of
protestation
with
his
head
but
taking
the
bottle
with
his
hand
none
the
less
drew
a
deep
draught
from
its
throttle
and
sighed
as
sadly
as
his
friend
sighed
gladly
i
will
drink
but
i
can
not
be
merry
what
the
good
of
building
a
noble
gallows
if
nobody
looks
at
it
one
might
as
well
be
building
a
church
laughed
all
paris
is
on
the
walls
watching
the
battle
lucky
paris
laughed
not
so
lucky
if
we
do
win
the
battle
was
complacent
whichever
wins
will
need
us
to
hang
the
losers
look
at
the
bright
side
man
fumbled
his
beads
furtively
i
lost
heart
i
tell
you
i
have
hanged
a
man
for
a
week
as
he
mourned
over
this
melancholy
retrospect
the
door
of
a
little
house
hard
by
the
church
opened
and
an
old
woman
propping
herself
on
a
crutch
stick
came
hobbling
slowly
across
the
open
space
towards
the
church
knew
her
well
enough
for
they
both
lodged
in
the
same
house
and
both
on
the
same
floor
of
attics
he
knew
she
was
the
mother
of
the
greatest
scapegrace
in
all
paris
a
rascal
named
françois
villon
who
had
disappeared
heaven
alone
knew
where
to
the
old
lady
great
despair
he
saluted
her
good
humoredly
good
morrow
to
your
nightcap
mother
have
you
found
your
lost
sheep
mother
villon
shook
her
head
wistfully
they
say
he
is
banished
but
he
has
sent
me
money
bless
him
though
i
touch
none
of
it
lest
it
be
badly
come
by
stopped
fumbling
his
beads
and
advanced
towards
her
extending
his
hand
give
it
to
me
to
spend
on
masses
he
asked
sanctimoniously
danced
between
them
lend
it
to
me
for
drink
money
he
urged
the
old
woman
paid
no
heed
to
their
proposals
her
tired
eyes
had
caught
sight
of
the
grim
structure
in
wood
which
usurped
a
place
in
a
familiar
scene
she
shaded
her
eyes
and
peered
at
it
asking
for
whom
do
you
build
this
gallows
the
glum
hangman
answered
gloomily
oddly
enough
we
do
know
me
a
gallows
here
says
the
constable
the
open
place
and
sieges
for
the
king
and
his
courtiers
mother
villon
her
simple
curiosity
easily
satisfied
dropped
her
informant
a
curtsey
and
hobbled
slowly
up
the
steps
into
the
church
stretched
himself
again
and
yawned
i
to
sleep
and
dream
of
hanging
a
king
put
a
lean
finger
to
his
lean
chin
treason
friend
if
tristan
heard
you
eyes
twinkled
well
let
say
an
archbishop
he
said
nodded
approvingly
an
archbishop
ought
to
make
a
good
end
his
mind
pleased
itself
with
the
picture
of
so
high
a
dignitary
of
the
church
in
his
full
canonicals
coming
under
his
tender
care
and
being
exhorted
by
his
pious
counsels
the
two
hangmen
climbed
on
the
platform
of
the
grisly
erection
and
calmly
indifferent
to
the
nature
of
their
bed
were
in
a
few
moments
fast
asleep
and
snoring
as
merrily
as
if
every
man
in
the
world
had
been
hung
and
there
was
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
but
to
take
it
easy
for
the
rest
of
their
days
the
hard
weariness
of
work
and
the
easy
weariness
of
wine
had
made
them
so
that
their
slumbers
were
not
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
footfalls
though
the
footfalls
echoed
strangely
loud
in
the
lonely
deserted
footfalls
of
a
woman
swift
and
impatient
the
footfalls
of
a
man
swiftly
pursuing
in
another
moment
the
woman
and
the
man
came
into
the
open
space
now
bright
and
shining
with
the
risen
sun
the
woman
was
katherine
de
vaucelles
the
man
was
noel
le
jolys
as
katherine
entered
the
silent
square
she
paused
for
a
moment
a
few
paces
from
the
church
and
turning
looked
at
her
silent
follower
why
do
you
follow
me
she
asked
and
noel
le
jolys
who
had
dogged
her
footsteps
from
the
palace
answered
her
briskly
you
should
not
walk
unguarded
therefore
i
shadow
you
katherine
scorned
him
you
may
well
play
the
shadow
for
you
cast
no
shadow
of
your
own
the
streets
are
very
idle
the
streets
are
very
quiet
i
would
sooner
have
my
loneliness
than
your
company
let
me
pass
to
my
prayers
for
noel
had
glided
between
her
and
the
church
and
stood
barring
her
passage
deferentially
for
your
lover
he
asked
and
katherine
flashed
at
him
you
have
a
small
mind
to
ask
yet
i
have
a
great
mind
to
answer
my
prayers
are
for
a
brave
gentleman
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
as
she
spoke
the
cup
of
her
heart
seemed
to
run
over
with
red
tears
and
the
bitter
waters
trembled
in
her
eyes
her
thoughts
wandered
over
the
long
white
night
and
her
sleepless
sorrow
and
her
vigil
by
the
window
looking
out
into
the
rose
garden
and
her
tired
eyes
straining
in
vain
through
the
dark
for
any
sight
and
her
tired
ears
straining
in
vain
for
any
sound
of
the
battle
in
which
the
lord
of
her
heart
was
risking
his
life
for
she
knew
it
now
she
had
learned
it
through
those
hours
of
agony
that
he
whom
she
called
her
enemy
was
the
lord
of
her
heart
that
in
spite
of
all
her
rage
at
the
cheat
that
had
been
put
upon
her
she
loved
not
the
great
noble
who
had
done
so
much
to
save
france
no
nor
the
ragged
poet
who
had
lent
her
his
and
his
sword
but
just
the
man
by
whatever
name
he
might
be
called
and
in
whatever
way
of
life
his
wheel
of
fortune
might
spin
whose
hand
had
proved
to
be
of
the
right
size
to
hold
her
heart
in
its
hollow
the
katherine
of
yesterday
seemed
to
be
dead
and
buried
to
have
died
a
fiery
death
of
fierce
thoughts
fierce
agonies
fierce
exultations
and
from
that
travail
a
new
katherine
had
come
into
being
with
cleansed
eyes
to
see
the
world
truly
and
with
a
cleansed
soul
to
know
a
great
soul
truth
noel
watched
her
silence
but
it
meant
nothing
to
him
and
he
tripped
into
her
high
thoughts
cheerfully
i
am
a
brave
gentleman
he
said
patting
himself
approvingly
upon
the
breast
i
slew
thibaut
last
night
the
king
has
taken
me
back
into
favour
if
i
played
the
fool
part
yesterday
i
can
play
the
wise
man
part
i
was
a
bubble
and
a
gull
and
a
dunce
if
you
like
but
i
meant
no
harm
to
the
king
and
the
king
smiles
on
me
can
not
you
do
the
like
katherine
came
out
of
her
dream
and
stood
upon
the
earth
again
and
disdained
him
no
for
you
envy
a
great
spirit
and
your
envy
makes
you
a
base
thing
noel
protested
pettishly
he
is
no
he
is
made
of
adam
clay
like
the
rest
of
us
katherine
thoughts
had
wandered
away
from
her
escort
her
eyes
were
busy
with
waving
banners
the
shock
of
meeting
lances
the
glitter
of
steel
coats
and
the
beating
of
steel
upon
steel
through
all
the
melley
her
fancy
spied
one
shining
figure
in
bright
armour
like
so
it
seemed
to
her
archangel
michael
or
archangel
gabriel
riding
in
the
pride
of
the
fight
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
sorrow
in
his
heart
and
a
token
of
white
ribbon
between
his
and
his
breast
she
answered
not
noel
words
but
her
thoughts
my
pride
has
the
right
to
hate
him
but
i
think
he
is
still
my
soul
man
noel
was
about
to
speak
again
when
he
suddenly
fell
back
and
doffed
his
bonnet
perched
on
the
steps
of
the
church
stood
the
stooped
sable
figure
of
the
king
just
coming
from
his
matinal
devotions
in
the
shadow
behind
him
stood
his
shadows
tristan
and
olivier
katherine
her
attention
swerved
by
noel
glance
turned
and
swayed
a
reverence
to
louis
as
he
slowly
descended
the
steps
the
king
surveyed
them
sardonically
good
morning
friends
he
said
then
turning
to
noel
he
ordered
take
the
top
of
your
speed
to
anthony
gate
and
bring
hot
news
of
the
battle
noel
bowed
and
sped
on
his
errand
katherine
requested
have
i
your
majesty
leave
tristan
and
olivier
withdrew
themselves
discreetly
apart
under
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
that
building
of
all
human
buildings
which
was
most
dear
to
their
hearts
and
most
sacred
in
their
eyes
louis
came
very
close
to
the
pale
girl
and
whispered
are
you
so
hungry
for
your
devotions
that
you
can
not
waste
some
worldly
words
on
me
are
you
still
angry
with
me
for
the
trick
i
played
on
you
katherine
pale
face
flushed
a
little
as
she
answered
it
is
wasted
spirit
to
be
angry
with
a
king
louis
grinned
you
are
as
pat
with
your
answers
as
a
clerk
at
matins
could
you
give
me
your
heart
now
if
i
bent
my
knee
katherine
stifled
a
great
sigh
i
lost
my
heart
last
night
i
have
not
found
it
again
louis
flung
up
his
hands
in
contemptuous
amusement
the
fellow
was
a
fool
to
blab
so
glibly
i
would
have
carried
the
jest
farther
but
he
stood
on
the
punctilio
and
would
not
win
you
without
confession
the
girl
heart
swelled
i
am
glad
he
had
so
much
honour
she
said
and
the
shining
figure
in
the
bright
armour
seemed
more
than
ever
louis
looked
at
her
intently
tickling
his
chin
with
his
forefinger
if
you
wait
in
the
church
for
his
homecoming
you
will
see
how
the
jest
ends
he
said
katherine
made
the
king
a
profound
reverence
and
slowly
entered
the
church
every
pulse
of
her
body
pleading
in
prayer
for
her
lost
lover
she
scarcely
heeded
an
old
bowed
woman
who
tottered
out
propped
on
a
crutch
stick
and
who
dropped
the
great
lady
a
respectful
curtsey
as
she
passed
and
went
her
ways
into
the
silent
streets
so
the
two
women
in
the
world
whom
villon
loved
met
for
the
firsf
time
louis
left
alone
beckoned
to
tristan
and
olivier
who
hurried
down
to
him
there
goes
a
brave
lady
gossips
a
fair
lady
a
chaste
lady
she
sails
in
the
high
latitudes
of
lore
and
deserves
to
find
the
fortunate
islands
are
there
not
better
things
to
do
with
master
villon
than
to
hang
him
olivier
protested
this
villon
is
such
a
damnable
double
dealer
that
the
populace
loves
him
better
than
you
the
king
visage
soured
that
is
enough
to
hang
him
yet
i
have
a
kind
of
liking
for
the
fellow
and
my
dream
troubles
me
the
star
that
fell
from
heaven
tristan
commented
bluffly
hang
the
rascal
while
you
can
and
thank
heaven
you
are
well
rid
of
him
even
as
he
spoke
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
be
full
of
many
noises
and
many
voices
from
beyond
the
gate
on
the
ways
that
led
to
the
city
walls
came
the
clamour
of
hoarse
shouts
and
cries
and
the
thudding
din
of
running
feet
from
the
other
side
from
the
street
that
led
to
the
louvre
came
the
ordered
tramp
of
soldiers
olivier
interpreting
one
interruption
said
the
people
are
coming
from
the
walls
and
tristan
interpreted
the
other
the
queen
sire
he
announced
through
the
narrow
space
that
led
into
the
open
square
there
came
a
line
of
soldiers
escorting
a
number
of
splendidly
caparisoned
litters
the
carriages
of
the
queen
and
the
queen
chief
ladies
louis
advanced
to
the
first
litter
and
extending
his
hand
assisted
the
queen
to
descend
and
conducted
her
with
an
elaborate
display
of
polite
affection
to
the
gorgeous
dais
by
the
side
of
the
church
where
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
small
thrones
that
had
been
prepared
for
them
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
ranged
themselves
in
their
places
behind
the
royal
pair
and
the
scottish
archers
formed
a
solid
force
in
front
through
the
open
gateway
came
a
few
running
shouting
enthusiasts
outstrippers
of
the
mass
of
citizens
who
were
returning
from
the
walls
even
the
heavy
sleep
of
and
was
not
proof
against
all
this
tumult
they
awoke
rubbed
their
eyes
then
climbing
briskly
to
their
feet
leaned
over
the
platform
on
the
handrails
of
the
gallows
and
surveyed
the
scene
with
interest
noel
le
jolys
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
aboat
the
gateway
and
advanced
to
the
king
sire
he
said
the
latest
message
from
the
battle
the
day
is
wholly
ours
the
grand
constable
returns
in
triumph
you
can
hear
his
music
now
louis
nodded
it
is
very
well
he
affirmed
gravely
through
the
gateway
the
crowd
of
people
was
pouring
thick
and
fast
shouting
and
cheering
and
filling
the
square
in
front
of
the
dais
with
a
throng
of
enthusiastic
men
women
and
children
all
waving
their
arms
flinging
flowers
and
yelling
welcomes
at
the
topmost
pitch
of
their
lungs
the
sound
of
military
music
and
the
tramp
of
marching
men
could
be
heard
approaching
louder
and
louder
five
girls
had
forced
their
way
to
the
very
front
row
of
the
throne
and
were
applauding
and
shouting
with
the
rest
these
were
the
light
ladies
of
the
fircone
isabeau
jehanneton
denise
and
blanche
with
guillemette
fat
robin
turgis
fat
daughter
they
were
all
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
for
their
lovers
had
vanished
over
night
and
their
abbess
had
disappeared
like
a
dream
and
they
knew
not
what
had
become
of
them
they
had
little
fear
for
their
lovers
for
the
good
gentlemen
of
the
fellowship
of
the
cockleshell
had
a
way
of
diving
into
the
deep
waters
of
existence
at
intervals
in
order
to
escape
the
too
attentive
eye
and
the
too
particular
finger
of
the
law
and
the
girls
had
a
vague
idea
of
some
great
scheme
on
hand
which
might
easily
result
in
trouble
for
the
brotherhood
as
for
their
abbess
they
were
none
too
sorry
to
be
free
from
her
somewhat
decisive
authority
and
they
chattered
and
babbled
like
birds
escaped
from
a
cage
by
this
time
the
advance
guard
of
the
army
began
to
pour
in
through
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
gateway
and
to
form
a
line
in
front
of
the
populace
thus
leaving
a
wide
open
space
between
the
assembled
people
and
the
seated
king
from
every
window
heads
were
thrust
and
hands
extended
waving
scarfs
of
silk
or
scattering
flowers
the
blare
of
the
soldiers
music
grew
louder
and
louder
the
tramp
of
horse
and
men
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
when
the
cheering
was
at
its
shrillest
and
the
rain
of
flowers
thickest
villon
rode
in
through
the
gateway
on
his
great
warhorse
with
his
five
ruffians
close
at
his
heels
villon
lifted
hand
gave
the
signal
for
a
halt
and
he
leaped
lightly
off
his
horse
and
advanced
towards
the
king
a
glorious
figure
to
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
in
his
shining
armour
with
a
scarlet
coif
upon
his
helmet
if
for
a
moment
his
glance
rested
on
the
gaunt
skeleton
of
the
gallows
there
came
no
change
in
the
proud
composure
of
his
face
immediately
behind
him
followed
the
faithful
ragamuffins
each
of
whom
bore
vivid
signs
in
slung
arm
swathed
leg
or
bandaged
forehead
of
the
lusty
work
he
had
done
in
the
name
upon
the
king
enemies
but
the
slings
and
swathes
and
bandages
were
of
no
common
sort
but
splendid
bits
of
silk
of
many
colours
bearing
fantastic
devices
and
rich
in
threads
of
gold
and
silver
as
villon
and
his
fantastic
escort
strode
towards
the
presence
noel
interposed
indignantly
he
stretched
a
pair
of
protecting
arms
wide
out
to
ward
off
from
the
king
the
approach
of
so
singular
a
deputation
while
he
demanded
angrily
in
heaven
name
sir
who
are
these
scarecrows
who
flaunt
their
tatters
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
king
nursed
his
chin
with
an
amused
smile
as
villon
answered
the
scarecrows
are
rogues
who
have
fought
like
gentlefolk
and
these
rags
are
the
banners
of
the
enemy
even
as
he
spoke
the
rapscallions
stripped
the
pieces
of
silk
from
arm
and
leg
and
forehead
shook
them
out
into
such
semblance
of
their
original
shape
as
battle
had
left
to
them
and
flung
them
with
a
gesture
of
imperial
pride
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
well
answered
said
louis
regally
while
two
pursuivants
pounced
swiftly
upon
the
bits
of
silk
and
gathering
them
up
with
reverential
fingers
laid
them
upon
the
railing
in
front
of
the
king
chair
to
be
examined
with
loving
care
by
the
queen
standing
erect
villon
addressed
the
king
louis
of
france
we
bring
you
these
silks
for
your
carpet
an
hour
ago
they
wooed
the
wind
from
burgundian
staves
and
floated
over
burgundian
helmets
i
will
make
no
vain
glory
of
their
winning
burgundy
fought
well
but
france
fought
better
and
these
trophies
trail
in
our
triumph
to
a
mercer
eyes
these
bits
of
tissue
are
but
so
many
squares
of
damaged
web
to
a
soldier
eye
they
cover
crowded
graves
with
honour
to
a
king
eye
they
deck
one
throne
with
lonely
splendour
when
we
here
who
breathe
hard
from
fighting
and
ye
who
stand
there
and
marvel
are
dust
when
the
king
name
is
but
a
golden
space
in
chronicles
grey
with
age
these
banners
shall
hang
from
cathedral
arches
and
your
children
children
children
lifted
in
reverent
arms
shall
peep
through
the
dim
air
at
the
faded
colours
and
baby
lips
shall
whisper
an
echo
of
our
battle
chapter
xv
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
as
villon
ended
a
great
peal
of
music
came
from
the
church
the
magnificent
music
of
a
te
deum
laudamus
while
from
the
soldiers
who
choked
the
archway
a
glowing
sea
of
steel
there
rose
one
common
cry
of
god
save
the
grand
constable
olivier
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
the
king
they
cheer
him
sire
louis
waved
him
impatiently
aside
and
leaning
over
the
railing
spoke
my
lord
constable
and
you
brave
soldiers
the
king
of
france
thanks
you
for
your
gift
victory
was
indeed
assured
you
by
the
justice
of
our
cause
my
lord
of
montcorbier
you
may
promise
these
brave
fellows
that
their
sovereign
will
remember
them
swiftly
villon
turned
and
addressed
the
motley
throng
behind
him
in
the
king
name
a
gold
coin
to
every
man
who
fought
and
a
cup
of
wine
to
every
man
woman
and
child
who
wishes
to
drink
the
health
the
king
smiled
wryly
ever
generous
he
said
to
the
end
sire
villon
answered
with
an
ironic
salutation
which
louis
answered
by
an
ironic
question
what
have
you
now
to
do
villon
saluted
the
king
again
my
latest
duty
sire
he
answered
and
once
again
he
turned
to
address
the
multitude
soldiers
who
have
served
under
me
friends
who
have
fought
with
me
and
you
people
whom
i
have
striven
to
succour
listen
to
my
amazing
swan
song
you
know
me
a
little
as
count
of
montcorbier
grand
constable
of
france
i
know
myself
indifferently
well
as
françois
villon
master
of
arts
broker
of
ballads
and
somewhile
bibber
and
brawler
it
is
now
my
task
as
grand
constable
of
france
to
declare
that
the
life
of
master
françois
villon
is
forfeit
and
to
pronounce
on
him
this
sentence
that
he
be
straightway
hanged
upon
yonder
gibbet
his
words
fell
like
the
beat
of
a
passing
bell
upon
the
ears
of
an
absolutely
silent
crowd
and
for
some
few
seconds
the
silence
brooded
over
the
place
the
five
wantons
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
caught
at
each
others
fingers
and
gasped
was
that
splendid
gentleman
their
old
friend
françois
villon
as
for
the
five
rogues
who
knew
the
secret
they
had
begun
to
laugh
at
first
words
but
the
laughter
dried
upon
their
lips
as
he
ended
from
the
church
suddenly
the
exultant
music
of
the
te
deum
ceased
to
swell
and
in
its
place
crept
forth
upon
the
silent
air
the
awful
notes
of
a
miserere
the
king
had
been
at
the
ear
of
the
organist
that
morning
and
had
planned
his
effects
well
the
melancholy
music
stirred
the
people
to
murmurs
of
surprise
and
protest
guy
tabarie
flourishing
his
notched
and
bloody
sword
thrust
his
round
body
forward
what
jest
is
this
he
asked
and
villon
answered
him
such
a
jest
as
i
would
rather
weep
over
than
laugh
at
for
the
pitcher
breaks
at
the
well
mouth
this
very
morning
messire
noel
to
you
i
surrender
my
sword
i
like
to
believe
that
it
has
scraped
a
little
shame
from
its
master
coat
he
drew
his
great
and
handed
it
to
noel
le
jolys
who
for
one
of
the
few
times
in
his
life
astonished
into
forgetfulness
of
courtly
etiquette
had
been
staring
at
the
astonishing
revelation
that
had
just
been
made
to
him
the
gleam
of
the
weapon
recalled
him
to
himself
and
he
took
it
from
the
hands
of
the
doomed
man
with
a
grave
courtesy
which
meant
something
more
than
the
official
fulfillment
of
a
formal
duty
noel
le
jolys
was
a
soldier
and
his
eyes
paid
homage
to
a
brave
man
villon
turned
to
tristan
master
tristan
perform
your
office
upon
this
felon
with
great
alacrity
tristan
moved
towards
villon
but
his
motion
was
met
by
such
angry
murmurs
from
the
crowd
and
not
from
the
crowd
alone
but
from
the
soldiers
who
had
followed
villon
to
victory
that
even
he
shrank
back
instinctively
before
its
menace
there
came
cries
from
a
thousand
throats
calling
on
the
king
to
pardon
the
grand
constable
calling
upon
those
who
loved
him
to
rescue
him
king
is
this
justice
rené
de
montigny
shouted
and
his
question
evoked
a
roar
of
approval
from
the
multitude
the
king
keen
glance
surveyed
the
scene
with
no
sign
of
fear
and
no
sign
of
annoyance
leaning
easily
upon
the
railing
as
a
man
might
lean
who
surveyed
an
amusing
farce
or
interlude
he
addressed
the
crowd
good
people
of
paris
you
have
heard
your
grand
constable
pronounce
sentence
upon
a
criminal
has
master
françois
villon
any
reason
to
urge
any
plea
to
offer
why
the
sentence
should
not
be
carried
out
villon
waved
his
hand
disdainfully
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
sire
françois
villon
must
die
it
bad
luck
for
him
but
he
has
worse
luck
and
so
to
business
as
he
spoke
he
drew
near
to
the
line
of
scottish
archers
and
two
of
their
number
laid
hands
on
him
one
at
either
side
the
sight
of
their
hero
thus
in
the
very
clutch
of
justice
spurred
the
multitude
to
renéwed
exasperation
angry
demands
for
justice
for
mercy
for
rescue
shook
the
summer
air
unarmed
citizens
broke
into
an
armourer
shop
hard
by
and
seizing
whatever
weapons
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
flourished
them
aloft
in
significant
assertion
that
their
words
were
but
the
prefaces
to
deeds
again
bull
voice
bellowed
to
those
about
him
kings
must
listen
to
the
voice
of
the
people
shall
the
man
who
led
us
to
victory
die
a
rogue
death
and
again
his
thunder
heralded
a
storm
soldiers
and
citizens
alike
seemed
prepared
to
rescue
villon
by
force
from
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
scottish
archers
with
levelled
arquebusses
formed
a
line
in
front
of
the
dais
and
every
courtier
drew
his
sword
only
the
king
seemed
unmoved
only
the
king
seemed
entertained
by
the
wind
he
had
sowed
the
whirlwind
he
had
reaped
he
asked
quite
quietly
does
master
françois
villon
ask
his
life
villon
shook
his
head
no
sire
master
françois
villon
played
and
master
françois
villon
pays
as
he
spoke
the
angry
people
swaying
like
a
sea
shouted
new
shouts
of
rescue
clamoured
new
cries
for
pardon
olivier
whispered
eagerly
to
the
king
sire
the
rogues
are
in
a
damnable
temper
can
you
not
gain
time
postpone
promise
louis
answered
imperturbably
are
the
fools
so
fond
of
the
fellow
i
know
a
way
to
stop
their
shouting
as
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
he
rose
from
his
seat
a
frail
small
black
figure
to
dominate
those
raging
waves
of
humanity
while
olivier
holding
up
his
hand
to
order
silence
shouted
peace
peace
the
king
would
speak
with
his
good
people
of
paris
the
noisy
voices
dropped
slowly
into
silence
to
hear
what
the
king
said
good
people
of
paris
i
am
no
tyrant
but
a
king
is
the
father
of
his
people
and
his
ears
can
never
be
shut
against
the
cries
of
his
children
you
all
love
this
man
hear
then
my
judgment
this
life
is
forfeit
which
of
you
will
redeem
it
if
there
be
one
among
you
ready
to
take
master
françois
villon
place
on
yonder
gibbet
let
that
one
speak
now
there
was
a
brief
silence
as
the
mob
began
to
realize
the
meaning
of
the
king
words
a
silence
broken
by
angry
cries
what
does
he
mean
take
his
place
on
the
gallows
a
trick
a
trick
louis
grinned
complacently
no
trick
friends
but
a
simple
bargain
here
is
a
man
condemned
to
death
here
is
an
idle
gibbet
if
ye
prize
him
so
highly
let
one
among
you
die
for
him
it
has
been
said
by
the
wise
apostle
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
friends
on
my
word
as
a
king
when
such
a
splendid
volunteer
is
swinging
at
the
end
of
yonder
rope
that
moment
master
françois
villon
shall
go
free
come
who
will
slip
neck
in
noose
for
the
sake
of
a
hero
villon
protested
haughtily
no
man
shall
die
for
me
but
indeed
his
protest
was
premature
the
anger
of
the
crowd
dwindled
into
sullen
clamours
the
king
laughs
at
us
is
too
much
to
ask
a
faint
exultant
smile
flickered
over
the
king
face
as
he
asked
now
friends
where
is
your
idol
supplement
who
will
be
his
lieutenant
who
will
be
heir
to
his
heritage
of
a
cross
bar
and
a
rope
you
are
not
so
brisk
as
you
were
does
your
devotion
falter
were
you
mocking
me
and
him
villon
looked
at
the
king
with
a
kind
of
disdainful
admiration
king
of
foxes
he
applauded
and
the
king
heard
him
and
smiled
again
tristan
he
said
go
into
yonder
church
and
bring
me
an
inch
of
candle
tristan
bowed
and
entered
the
church
the
king
went
on
our
royal
mercy
is
mild
our
royal
mercy
is
patient
as
it
is
our
hope
and
our
belief
to
live
in
history
as
a
good
and
gracious
sovereign
we
would
not
have
it
said
of
us
that
we
denied
even
a
felon
all
due
and
reasonable
opportunity
even
while
he
spoke
tristan
came
out
of
the
church
carrying
in
his
hand
a
great
gold
candlestick
in
whose
socket
a
little
piece
of
candle
scarce
an
inch
high
still
was
burning
he
gave
it
into
the
hands
of
one
of
the
soldiers
of
the
scottish
guard
who
held
it
in
his
strong
grasp
and
stood
as
immovable
as
a
statue
while
the
thin
faint
flame
pointed
towards
heaven
in
the
warm
and
windless
air
louis
stopped
and
whispered
to
a
page
behind
him
who
bowed
and
entered
the
church
then
the
king
spoke
again
to
the
silent
wondering
crowd
so
long
as
this
candle
burns
so
long
françois
villon
lives
if
while
it
burns
one
of
you
is
moved
to
take
master
villon
place
on
the
gallows
so
much
the
better
for
master
villon
and
so
much
the
worse
for
his
substitute
herald
proclaim
our
pleasure
at
a
sign
from
montjoye
the
royal
herald
two
pursuivants
stirred
the
air
with
the
blast
of
golden
trumpets
then
montjoye
spoke
the
king
grace
and
the
king
justice
is
ready
to
grant
life
and
liberty
to
françois
villon
if
anyone
be
found
willing
to
take
his
place
on
the
gallows
and
die
his
death
that
he
may
live
his
life
as
montjoye
words
died
away
a
great
silence
fell
upon
the
assembled
people
a
silence
so
still
and
cruel
that
men
hearts
grew
cold
and
the
warm
june
air
seemed
to
be
sighing
over
fields
of
ice
the
king
leaned
over
and
addressed
his
prisoner
confidentially
master
villon
master
villon
you
see
what
human
friendship
means
and
the
sweet
voices
of
the
multitude
villon
answered
boldly
sire
it
is
no
news
to
me
that
men
love
the
dear
habit
of
living
louis
signalled
to
montjoye
proclaim
again
he
said
and
once
more
the
pair
of
pursuivants
blew
their
trumpets
and
once
again
montjoye
made
his
singular
proposition
of
pardon
to
the
assemblage
chapter
xvi
we
speak
to
men
it
fell
this
time
upon
fresh
ears
the
ears
of
an
old
woman
who
was
patiently
pushing
her
way
through
the
crowd
in
her
effort
to
reach
her
humble
lodging
she
had
succeeded
in
making
her
way
to
the
open
space
as
the
last
words
of
the
herald
offer
were
being
spoken
and
suddenly
her
dulled
brain
caught
the
full
significance
of
speech
looking
wildly
around
her
she
saw
where
villon
stood
an
armoured
figure
held
captive
and
without
attempting
to
realize
the
meaning
of
what
she
beheld
she
dropped
her
stick
and
tottered
forward
to
the
dais
where
she
fell
on
her
knees
with
clasped
entreating
hands
sire
sire
i
will
die
for
him
villon
heart
leaped
to
his
throat
when
he
saw
her
mammy
mammy
go
away
he
cried
and
he
made
a
vain
attempt
to
move
towards
his
mother
a
movement
instantly
restrained
by
the
crossed
weapons
of
his
captors
at
the
same
moment
katherine
de
vaucelles
came
out
of
the
church
door
in
obedience
to
the
summons
of
a
royal
page
who
had
found
her
at
her
prayers
and
who
told
her
that
the
king
desired
her
presence
she
paused
at
the
head
of
the
steps
in
amazed
survey
of
the
crowded
place
and
a
scene
that
at
first
she
could
not
understand
who
is
this
woman
louis
asked
looking
down
at
the
poor
old
dame
who
knelt
before
him
and
besought
him
olivier
answered
in
his
ear
the
fellow
mother
sire
a
very
little
tenderness
came
into
louis
eyes
a
very
little
tenderness
trembled
on
his
lips
woman
we
can
not
hear
you
he
said
by
god
law
you
have
given
him
life
once
and
by
my
law
you
may
not
give
him
life
again
sire
i
beseech
you
mother
villon
entreated
but
the
king
pity
was
not
to
be
purchased
so
take
her
away
and
use
her
gently
he
said
noel
le
jolys
stooped
to
obey
the
king
command
but
the
old
woman
rising
to
her
feet
repulsed
him
fiercely
no
no
she
said
i
will
not
leave
my
son
and
she
flung
her
old
body
passionately
upon
the
prisoner
neck
and
clasped
with
her
lean
arms
his
mailed
shoulders
louis
bade
montjoye
proclaim
for
the
last
time
and
once
again
the
trumpets
thundered
and
once
again
the
cold
calm
voice
of
montjoye
propounded
the
grim
terms
of
the
king
clemency
the
silence
that
followed
was
swiftly
broken
by
the
sweet
clear
voice
of
a
girl
i
will
said
katherine
de
vaucelles
from
her
stand
on
the
church
steps
and
on
the
instant
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
spot
where
the
maiden
stood
with
face
as
white
as
and
her
hands
tightly
clenched
by
her
sides
she
moved
slowly
down
the
steps
in
the
dead
silence
and
paused
before
the
king
throne
i
will
die
for
him
sire
she
said
quietly
from
villon
lips
there
came
a
mighty
cry
of
katherine
and
a
fain
spot
of
colour
rose
on
the
king
cheeks
mistress
we
speak
to
men
he
said
tristan
pressed
his
great
hands
together
by
denis
our
women
seem
to
make
the
best
men
he
grunted
katherine
stood
tall
and
proud
facing
the
king
mother
villon
stirred
by
this
heavenly
interference
left
her
son
to
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
angel
lady
and
kiss
the
hem
of
her
garment
katherine
spoke
bravely
sire
i
love
this
man
and
would
be
proud
to
die
for
him
it
may
chime
with
your
pleasure
to
slay
him
it
can
not
chime
with
your
honour
to
deny
me
your
word
is
given
and
a
king
must
keep
his
word
the
king
made
an
impatient
gesture
we
speak
to
men
villon
caught
at
his
words
i
speak
to
a
woman
he
cried
and
gazirig
passionately
at
his
love
he
called
to
her
katherine
my
katherine
death
is
a
little
thing
for
love
is
deathless
and
you
give
me
a
better
thing
than
life
with
unmoved
voice
with
unchanged
face
katherine
persisted
sire
i
claim
your
promise
louis
again
denied
her
we
speak
to
men
tristan
do
your
office
at
this
moment
the
situation
suddenly
changed
villon
unexpectedly
wrenched
himself
free
from
the
control
of
the
two
soldiers
beside
him
whose
hold
had
relaxed
in
their
wonder
at
what
was
passing
and
sprang
towards
katherine
his
act
instantly
inspired
the
hearts
and
hands
of
his
sympathisers
and
in
a
second
he
was
caught
up
and
encircled
by
a
crowd
of
armed
and
determined
men
who
drove
back
the
scottish
archers
villon
snatched
a
drawn
sword
from
the
hand
of
rené
de
montigny
and
held
it
high
in
the
air
while
he
shouted
no
by
god
rood
the
candle
of
my
grace
has
not
yet
burnt
to
the
socket
people
of
paris
shall
i
not
speak
to
my
lover
before
i
die
the
place
was
a
raving
bedlam
of
noise
and
menace
the
scottish
archers
did
not
dare
to
make
any
attempt
to
recapture
their
escaped
prisoner
but
kept
their
line
in
front
of
the
royal
dais
while
villon
stood
by
the
side
of
katherine
with
drawn
sword
an
archangel
of
insurrection
ready
at
any
moment
to
fling
the
forces
behind
him
upon
his
adversaries
yet
the
king
remained
as
unmoved
as
if
he
had
been
witnessing
a
puppet
show
in
his
thin
even
voice
he
commanded
speak
to
her
while
the
candle
burns
not
a
second
longer
with
one
accord
villon
adherents
drew
back
and
villon
was
left
with
katherine
alone
in
the
open
space
katherine
whispered
to
him
françois
will
you
not
take
life
at
my
hands
villon
answered
her
tenderly
dear
child
if
that
crowned
judas
there
had
taken
you
at
your
word
do
you
think
i
would
have
outlived
you
by
the
space
of
a
second
she
looked
fixedly
into
his
eyes
you
are
resolved
he
smiled
back
at
her
i
am
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
and
no
pleadings
will
move
me
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
with
a
shudder
dearest
the
candle
flickers
in
the
wind
there
is
a
dagger
in
your
girdle
slay
me
and
yourself
you
mean
it
he
gasped
and
she
answered
firmly
by
god
mother
and
god
son
a
sudden
wonderful
thought
flashed
through
villon
mind
he
had
won
love
he
could
not
hope
to
win
life
but
at
least
he
might
so
manage
as
to
die
a
soldier
death
and
not
a
knave
he
whispered
to
her
eagerly
then
we
will
spoil
old
louis
pleasure
yet
lore
will
you
marry
me
here
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
she
answered
him
with
all
my
heart
instantly
he
turned
and
left
her
and
strode
towards
the
throne
king
i
crave
your
patience
but
your
sentence
must
tarry
and
turn
for

smiled
derisively
it
is
too
late
sing
your
and

done
for
your
noose

too
large
for
a
wedding
ring
villon
gave
him
back
smile
for
smile
sire
he
said
i
am
a
master
of
arts
of
the
university
of
paris
and

such

the
right
in
extremis
to
any

bachelor
but

to

a
priest
king
louis
olivier
stooped
to
the
king
he
speaks
the
truth
sire
he
can
claim
this
right
louis
leaned
forward
interested
what
do
you
hope
to
gain
by
this
villon
answered
calmly
the
right
to
die
like
a
soldier
by
the
sword
not
like
a
rogue
by
the
rope
a
murmur
of
approval
stirred
the
silent
crowd
but
it
died
away
as
katherine
suddenly
advanced
and
stood
a
white
figure
like
a
fair
lily
between
the
king
and
villon
nay
you
gain
more
than
this
i
am
the
lady

birth
and
when

him
he

my
vassal
over
my
vassals
i
hold
the
law
of
life
and
death
villon
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
his
lady
louis
clapped
his
thin
hands
together
as
a
man
might
applaud
a
play
you
are
a
bold
minion
and
you
have
a
quick
wit
but
if
you
marry
this
gaol
bird
you
decline
to
his
condition
your
high
titles
fall
from
you
your
great
estates
are
forfeit
to
the
crown
and
you
and
he
must
go
out
into
exile
together
the
beggar
woman
with
the
beggar
man
katherine
turned
to
villon
where
he
knelt
beside
her
is
a
little
price
to

for

looking
up
into
her
eyes
questioned
her

she
repeated
her
words

a
little
price
to
pay
for
my
lover
do
you
doubt
me
unheeded
a
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
king
dais
and
whispered
some
words
in
the
ear
of
noel
le
jolys
who
in
turn
whispered
in
the
ear
of
olivier
and
olivier
hearing
grew
paler
than
before
villon
caught
katherine
by
the
hand
no
kate
no
the
world
is
wide
our
hearts
are
light
for
a
star
has
fallen
to
me
from
heaven
and
it
fills
the
earth
with
glory
his
words
fell
on
the
king
ears
like
the
voice
of
an
oracle
standing
in
his
place
with
staring
eyes
and
trembling
fingers
he
repeated
falteringly
the
mystic
words
a
star
has
fallen
from
heaven
my
dream
my
dream
olivier
plucked
at
his
mantle
whispering
with
twitching
lips
my
liege
this
story
spreads
like
the
plague
in
the
city
and
every
alley
vomits
mutiny
louis
pushed
him
aside

epilogue
at
about
this
point
in
his
narrative
dom
gregory
as
those
happy
few
who
are
familiar
with
his
manuscript
in
the
abbey
of
bonne
aventure
are
aware
diverges
from
the
full
current
of
his
story
to
indulge
in
some
philosophical
reflections
upon
the
character
of
louis
xi
what
dom
gregory
asks
in
cautious
interrogation
were
the
real
intentions
of
the
monarch
with
regard
to
françois
villon
and
the
lady
katherine
de
vaucelles
his
enemies
no
doubt
assert
that
he
played
with
their
destinies
for
a
purely
malignant
purpose
and
was
only
prevented
from
carrying
his
evil
intentions
into
effect
by
the
storm
of
popular
indignation
that
threatened
him
others
again
who
pretend
to
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
shifty
character
of
the
king
insist
that
he
did
indeed
purpose
to
send
master
villon
to
the
gallows
or
at
least
and
worse
into
a
beggar
exile
but
that
lie
was
stayed
by
master
villon
happy
use
of
the
phrase
concerning
a
star
fallen
from
heaven
which
words
harping
upon
the
superstitious
wits
of
his
majesty
made
him
believe
that
the
dream
which
had
puzzled
him
was
interpreted
and
fulfilled
in
this
regard
dom
gregory
records
with
a
sly
gravity
how
many
suggest
that
master
françois
used
those
words
of
set
purpose
with
the
very
intention
of
playing
upon
the
strained
strings
of
the
king
mind
but
there
be
those
too
dom
gregory
adds
and
we
gather
from
his
manner
that
he
is
inclined
to
include
himself
in
their
number
there
be
those
partisans
of
the
king
who
maintain
that
the
king
cruelty
was
from
the
start
a
mere
mask
for
clemency
that
he
only
intended
a
little
malicious
sport
with
the
too
outspoken
lover
and
the
too
disdainful
lass
and
that
it
had
never
been
in
the
scope
of
his
thoughts
seriously
to
punish
either
the
broker
of
ballads
or
the
valiant
maid
of
vaucelles
starting
from
this
point
dom
gregory
indulges
in
a
great
many
reflections
upon
kings
and
kingship
and
the
consequences
of
kingly
acts
all
of
which
seemed
perhaps
more
momentous
at
the
time
when
they
were
written
and
in
the
sleepy
abbey
where
they
lie
enshrined
than
in
busier
and
more
bustling
times
one
could
have
wished
that
dom
gregory
had
let
such
philosophies
go
by
the
board
and
had
given
us
instead
some
greater
knowledge
of
what
happened
to
françois
villon
and
katherine
de
vaucelles
after
they
fell
upon
each
necks
in
that
open
place
in
paris
with
the
mob
huzzahing
the
king
staring
and
tristan
strange
satellites
busily
dismantling
the
useless
gibbet
but
here
dom
gregory
is
little
less
than
dumb
losses
in
the
manuscript
account
for
much
of
his
silence
perhaps
his
ecclesiastical
indifference
to
the
wedded
state
may
account
for
more
if
we
can
gather
vaguely
from
other
sources
that
the
poet
and
his
mistress
settled
down
on
a
small
and
quiet
estate
in
poitou
lived
a
peaceful
country
life
for
many
years
and
died
a
peaceful
country
death
at
the
end
it
is
the
most
we
can
hope
to
gain
with
surety
we
are
glad
to
believe
in
their
happiness
for
he
was
a
true
lover
and
she
was
a
fair
woman
