often

from
the
attainment
of
that
very
point

his
admonitions
and
render
him
attentive
to
a
thousand
little
graces
and
little
decorums
which
would
escape
the
nicest
moralist
who
should
undertake
the
subject
on
uninterested
speculation
every
faculty
is
on
the
alarm
when
the
objects
of
such
tender
affection
are
concerned
in
the
writer
of
these
letters
paternal
tenderness
and
vigilance
were
doubled
as
he
was
at
that
time
sole
parent
death
having
before
deprived
the
young
ladies
of
their
excellent
mother
his
own
precarious
state
of
health
inspired
him
with
the
most
tender
solicitude
for
their
future
welfare
and
though
he
might
have
concluded
that
the
impression
made
by
his
instruction
and
uniform
example
could
never
be
effaced
from
the
memory
of
his
children
yet
his
anxiety
for
their
orphan
condition
suggested
to
him
this
method
of
continuing
to
them
those
advantages
the
editor
is
encouraged
to
offer
this
treatise
to
the
public
by
the
very
favourable
reception
which
the
rest
of
his
father
s
works
have
met
with
the
comparative
view
of
the
state
of
man
and
other
animals
and
the
essay
on
the
office
and
duties
of
a
physician
have
been
very
generally
read
and
if
he
is
not
deceived
by
the
partiality
of
his
friends
he
has
reason
to
believe
they
have
met
with
general
approbation
in
some
of
those
tracts
the
author
s
object
was
to
improve
the
taste
and
understanding
of
his
reader
in
others
to
mend
his
heart
in
others
to
point
out
to
him
the
proper
use
of
philosophy
by
showing
its
application
to
the
duties
of
common
life
in
all
his
writings
his
chief
view
was
the
good
of
his
and
those
among
his
friends
in
whose
taste
and
judgement
he
most
confided
think
the
publication
of
this
small
work
will
contribute
to
that
general
design
and
at
the
same
time
do
honour
to
his
memory
the
editor
can
no
longer
hesitate
to
comply
with
their
advice
in
communicating

and
love
introduction
my
dear
girls
you
had
the
misfortune
to
be
deprived
of
your
mother
at
a
time
of
life
when
you
were
insensible
of
your
loss
and
could
receive
little
benefit
either
from
her
instruction
or
her
before
this
comes
to
your
hands
you
will
likewise
have
lost
your
father
i
have
had
many
melancholy
reflexions
on
the
forlorn
and
helpless
situation
you
must
be
in
if
it
should
please
god
to
remove
me
from
you
before
you
arrive
at
that
period
of
life
when
you
will
be
able
to
think
and
act
for
yourselves
i
know
mankind
too
well
i
know
their
falsehood
their
dissipation
their
coldness
to
all
the
duties
of
friendship
and
humanity
i
know
the
little
attention
paid
to
helpless
you
will
meet
with
few
friends
disinterested
enough
to
do
you
good
offices
when
you
are
incapable
of
making
them
any
return
by
contributing
to
their
interest
or
their
pleasure
or
even
to
the
gratification
of
their
vanity
i
have
been
supported
under
the
gloom
naturally
arising
from
these
reflexions
by
a
reliance
on
the
goodness
of
that
providence
which
has
hitherto
preserved
you
and
given
me
the
most
pleasing
prospect
of
the
goodness
of
your
dispositions
and
by
the
secret
hope
that
your
mother
s
virtues
will
entail
a
blessing
on
her
children
the
anxiety
i
have
for
your
happiness
has
made
me
resolve
to
throw
together
my
sentiments
relating
to
your
future
conduct
in
life
if
i
live
for
some
years
you
will
receive
them
with
much
greater
advantage
suited
to
your
different
geniuses
and
dispositions
if
i
die
sooner
you
must
receive
them
in
this
very
imperfect
manner
the
last
proof
of
my
affection
you
will
all
remember
your
father
s
fondness
when
perhaps
every
other
circumstance
relating
to
him
is
forgotten
this
remembrance
i
hope
will
induce
you
to
give
a
serious
attention
to
the
advices
i
am
now
going
to
leave
with
i
can
request
this
attention
with
the
greater
confidence
as
my
sentiments
on
the
most
interesting
points
that
regard
life
and
manners
were
entirely
correspondent
to
your
mother
s
whose
judgment
and
taste
i
trusted
much
more
than
my
own
you
must
expect
that
the
advices
which
i
shall
give
you
will
be
very
imperfect
as
there
are
many
nameless
delicacies
in
female
manners
of
which
none
but
a
woman
can
you
will
have
one
advantage
by
attending
to
what
i
am
going
to
leave
with
you
you
will
hear
at
least
for
once
in
your
lives
the
genuine
sentiments
of
a
man
who
has
no
interest
in
flattering
or
deceiving
i
shall
throw
my
reflexions
together
without
any
studied
order
and
shall
only
to
avoid
confusion
range
them
under
a
few
general
heads
you
will
see
in
a
little
treatise
of
mine
just
published
in
what
an
honourable
point
of
view
i
have
considered
your
sex
not
as
domestic
drudges
or
the
slaves
of
our
pleasures
but
as
our
companions
and
equals
as
designed
to
soften
our
hearts
and
polish
our
manners
and
as
thomson
finely
says
to
raise
the
virtues
animate
the
bliss
and
sweeten
all
the
toils
of
human
life
i
shall
not
repeat
what
i
have
there
said
on
this
subject
and
shall
only
observe
that
from
the
view
i
have
given
of
your
natural
character
and
place
in
society
there
arises
a
certain
propriety
of
conduct
peculiar
to
your
sex
it
is
this
peculiar
propriety
of
female
manners
of
which
i
intend
to
give
you
my
sentiments
without
touching
on
those
general
rules
of
conduct
by
which
men
and
women
are
equally
bound
while
i
explain
to
you
that
system
of
conduct
which
i
think
will
tend
most
to
your
honour
and
happiness
i
shall
at
the
same
time
endeavour
to
point
out
those
virtues
and
accomplishments
which
render
you
most
respectable
and
most
amiable
in
the
eyes
of
my
own
sex
religion
though
the
duties
of
religion
strictly
speaking
are
equally
binding
on
both
sexes
yet
certain
differences
in
their
natural
character
and
education
render
some
vices
in
your
sex
particularly
odious
the
natural
hardness
of
our
hearts
and
strength
of
our
passions
inflamed
by
the
uncontrolled
licence
we
are
too
often
indulged
with
in
our
youth
are
apt
to
render
our
manners
more
dissolute
and
make
us
less
susceptible
of
the
finer
feelings
of
the
heart
your
superior
delicacy
your
modesty
and
the
usual
severity
of
your
education
preserve
you
in
a
great
measure
from
any
temptation
to
those
vices
to
which
we
are
most
subjected
the
natural
softness
and
sensibility
of
your
dispositions
particularly
fit
you
for
the
practice
of
those
duties
where
the
heart
is
chiefly
concerned
and
this
along
with
the
natural
warmth
of
your
imagination
renders
you
peculiarly
susceptible
of
the
feelings
of
devotion
there
are
many
circumstances
in
your
situation
that
peculiarly
require
the
supports
of
religion
to
enable
you
to
act
in
them
with
spirit
and
propriety
your
whole
life
is
often
a
life
of
suffering
you
can
not
plunge
into
business
or
dissipate
yourselves
in
pleasure
and
riot
as
men
too
often
do
when
under
the
pressure
of
misfortunes
you
must
bear
your
sorrows
in
silence
unknown
and
unpitied
you
must
often
put
on
a
face
of
serenity
and
cheerfulness
when
your
hearts
are
torn
with
anguish
or
sinking
in
despair
then
your
only
resource
is
in
the
consolations
of
religion
it
is
chiefly
owing
to
these
that
you
bear
domestic
misfortunes
better
than
we
do
but
you
are
sometimes
in
very
different
circumstances
that
equally
require
the
restraints
of
religion
the
natural
vivacity
and
perhaps
the
natural
vanity
of
your
sex
is
very
apt
to
lead
you
into
a
dissipated
state
of
life
that
deceives
you
under
the
appearance
of
innocent
pleasure
but
which
in
reality
wastes
your
spirits
impairs
your
health
weakens
all
the
superior
faculties
of
your
minds
and
often
sullies
your
reputations
religion
by
checking
this
dissipation
and
rage
for
pleasure
enables
you
to
draw
more
happiness
even
from
those
very
sources
of
amusement
which
when
too
frequently
applied
to
are
often
productive
of
satiety
and
disgust
religion
is
rather
a
matter
of
sentiment
than
reasoning
the
important
and
interesting
articles
of
faith
are
sufficiently
plain
fix
your
attention
on
these
and
do
not
meddle
with
controversy
if
you
get
into
that
you
plunge
into
a
chaos
from
which
you
will
never
be
able
to
extricate
yourselves
it
spoils
the
temper
and
i
suspect
has
no
good
effect
on
the
heart
avoid
all
books
and
all
conversation
that
tend
to
shake
your
faith
on
those
great
points
of
religion
which
should
serve
to
regulate
your
conduct
and
on
which
your
hopes
of
future
and
eternal
happiness
depend
never
indulge
yourselves
in
ridicule
on
religious
subjects
nor
give
countenance
to
it
in
others
by
seeming
diverted
with
what
they
say
this
to
people
of
good
breeding
will
be
a
sufficient
check
i
wish
you
to
go
no
further
than
the
scriptures
for
your
religious
opinions
embrace
those
you
find
clearly
revealed
never
perplex
yourselves
about
such
as
you
do
not
understand
but
treat
them
with
silent
and
becoming
i
would
advise
you
to
read
only
such
religious
books
as
are
addressed
to
the
heart
such
as
inspire
pious
and
devout
affections
such
as
are
proper
to
direct
you
in
your
conduct
and
not
such
as
tend
to
entangle
you
in
the
endless
maze
of
opinions
and
systems
be
punctual
in
the
stated
performance
of
your
private
devotions
morning
and
evening
if
you
have
any
sensibility
or
imagination
this
will
establish
such
an
intercourse
between
you
and
the
supreme
being
as
will
be
of
infinite
consequence
to
you
in
life
it
will
communicate
an
habitual
cheerfulness
to
your
tempers
give
a
firmness
and
steadiness
to
your
virtue
and
enable
you
to
go
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
human
life
with
propriety
and
dignity
i
wish
you
to
be
regular
in
your
attendance
on
public
worship
and
in
receiving
the
communion
allow
nothing
to
interrupt
your
public
or
private
devotions
except
the
performance
of
some
active
duty
in
life
to
which
they
should
always
give
in
your
behaviour
at
public
worship
observe
an
exemplary
attention
and
gravity
that
extreme
strictness
which
i
recommend
to
you
in
these
duties
will
be
considered
by
many
of
your
acquaintance
as
a
superstitious
attachment
to
forms
but
in
the
advices
i
give
you
on
this
and
other
subjects
i
have
an
eye
to
the
spirit
and
manners
of
the
age
there
is
a
levity
and
dissipation
in
the
present
manners
a
coldness
and
listlessness
in
whatever
relates
to
religion
which
can
not
fail
to
infect
you
unless
you
purposely
cultivate
in
your
minds
a
contrary
bias
and
make
the
devotional
taste
habitual
avoid
all
grimace
and
ostentation
in
your
religious
duties
they
are
the
usual
cloaks
of
hypocrisy
at
least
they
show
a
weak
and
vain
mind
do
not
make
religion
a
subject
of
common
conversation
in
mixed
companies
when
it
is
introduced
rather
seem
to
decline
it
at
the
same
time
never
suffer
any
person
to
insult
you
by
any
foolish
ribaldry
on
your
religious
opinions
but
show
the
same
resentment
you
would
naturally
do
on
being
offered
any
other
personal
insult
but
the
surest
way
to
avoid
this
is
by
a
modest
reserve
on
the
subject
and
by
using
no
freedom
with
others
about
their
religious
sentiments
cultivate
an
enlarged
charity
for
all
mankind
however
they
may
differ
from
you
in
their
religious
opinions
that
difference
may
probably
arise
from
causes
in
which
you
had
no
share
and
from
which
you
can
derive
no
merit
show
your
regard
to
religion
by
a
distinguishing
respect
to
all
its
ministers
of
whatever
persuasion
who
do
not
by
their
lives
dishonour
their
profession
but
never
allow
them
the
direction
of
your
consciences
lest
they
taint
you
with
the
narrow
spirit
of
their
party
the
best
effect
of
your
religion
will
be
a
diffusive
humanity
to
all
in
set
apart
a
certain
proportion
of
your
income
as
sacred
to
charitable
purposes
but
in
this
as
well
as
in
the
practice
of
every
other
duty
carefully
avoid
ostentation
vanity
is
always
defeating
her
own
purposes
fame
is
one
of
the
natural
rewards
of
virtue
do
not
pursue
her
and
she
will
follow
you
do
not
confine
your
charity
to
giving
money
you
may
have
many
opportunities
of
showing
a
tender
and
compassionate
spirit
where
your
money
is
not
there
is
a
false
and
unnatural
refinement
in
sensibility
which
makes
some
people
shun
the
sight
of
every
object
in
distress
never
indulge
this
especially
where
your
friends
or
acquaintances
are
concerned
let
the
days
of
their
misfortunes
when
the
world
forgets
or
avoids
them
be
the
season
for
you
to
exercise
your
humanity
and
friendship
the
sight
of
human
misery
softens
the
heart
and
makes
it
better
it
checks
the
pride
of
health
and
prosperity
and
the
distress
it
occasions
is
amply
compensated
by
the
consciousness
of
doing
your
duty
and
by
the
secret
endearment
which
nature
has
annexed
to
all
our
sympathetic
sorrows
women
are
greatly
deceived
when
they
think
they
recommend
themselves
to
our
sex
by
their
indifference
about
religion
even
those
men
who
are
themselves
unbelievers
dislike
infidelity
in
you
every
man
who
knows
human
nature
connects
a
religious
taste
in
your
sex
with
softness
and
sensibility
of
heart
at
least
we
always
consider
the
want
of
it
as
a
proof
of
that
hard
and
masculine
spirit
which
of
all
your
faults
we
dislike
the
most
besides
men
consider
your
religion
as
one
of
their
principal
securities
for
that
female
virtue
in
which
they
are
most
interested
if
a
gentleman
pretends
an
attachment
to
any
of
you
and
endeavours
to
shake
your
religious
principles
be
assured
he
is
either
a
fool
or
has
designs
on
you
which
he
dares
not
openly
avow
you
will
probably
wonder
at
my
having
educated
you
in
a
church
different
from
my
own
the
reason
was
plainly
this
i
looked
on
the
difference
between
our
churches
to
be
of
no
real
importance
and
that
a
preference
of
one
to
the
other
was
a
mere
matter
of
taste
your
mother
was
educated
in
the
church
of
england
and
had
an
attachment
to
it
and
i
had
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
every
thing
she
liked
it
never
was
her
desire
that
you
should
be
baptised
by
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
or
be
educated
in
that
church
on
the
contrary
the
delicacy
of
her
regard
to
the
smallest
circumstance
that
could
affect
me
in
the
eye
of
the
world
made
her
anxiously
insist
it
might
be
otherwise
but
i
could
not
yield
to
her
in
that
kind
of
when
i
lost
her
i
became
still
more
determined
to
educate
you
in
that
church
as
i
feel
a
secret
pleasure
in
doing
every
thing
that
appears
to
me
to
express
my
affection
and
veneration
for
her
i
draw
but
a

conduct

march
by
cadell
and
davies
one
of
the
chief
beauties
in
a
female
character
is
that
modest
reserve
that
retiring
delicacy
which
avoids
the
public
eye
and
is
disconcerted
even
at
the
gaze
of
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
insensible
to
applause
if
you
were
you
must
become
if
not
worse
at
least
less
amiable
women
but
you
may
be
dazzled
by
that
admiration
which
yet
rejoices
your
hearts
when
a
girl
ceases
to
blush
she
has
lost
the
most
powerful
charm
of
beauty
that
extreme
sensibility
which
it
indicates
may
be
a
weakness
and
incumbrance
in
our
sex
as
i
have
too
often
felt
but
in
yours
it
is
peculiarly
engaging
pedants
who
think
themselves
philosophers
ask
why
a
woman
should
blush
when
she
is
conscious
of
no
crime
it
is
a
sufficient
answer
that
nature
has
made
you
to
blush
when
you
are
guilty
of
no
fault
and
has
forced
us
to
love
you
because
you
do
blushing
is
so
far
from
being
necessarily
an
attendant
on
guilt
that
it
is
the
usual
companion
of
innocence
this
modesty
which
i
think
so
essential
in
your
sex
will
naturally
dispose
you
to
be
rather
silent
in
company
especially
in
a
large
people
of
sense
and
discernment
will
never
mistake
such
silence
for
dulness
one
may
take
a
share
in
conversation
without
uttering
a
syllable
the
expression
in
the
countenance
shows
it
and
this
never
escapes
an
observing
eye
i
should
be
glad
that
you
had
an
easy
dignity
in
your
behaviour
at
public
places
but
not
that
confident
ease
that
unabashed
countenance
which
seems
to
set
the
company
at
defiance
if
while
a
gentleman
is
speaking
to
you
one
of
superior
rank
addresses
you
do
not
let
your
eager
attention
and
visible
preference
betray
the
flutter
of
your
heart
let
your
pride
on
this
occasion
preserve
you
from
that
meanness
into
which
your
vanity
would
sink
you
consider
that
you
expose
yourselves
to
the
ridicule
of
the
company
and
affront
one
gentleman
only
to
swell
the
triumph
of
another
who
perhaps
thinks
he
does
you
honour
in
speaking
to
you
converse
with
men
even
of
the
first
rank
with
that
dignified
modesty
which
may
prevent
the
approach
of
the
most
distant
familiarity
and
consequently
prevent
them
from
feeling
themselves
your
superiors
wit
is
the
most
dangerous
talent
you
can
possess
it
must
be
guarded
with
great
discretion
and
otherwise
it
will
create
you
many
enemies
wit
is
perfectly
consistent
with
softness
and
delicacy
yet
they
are
seldom
found
united
wit
is
so
flattering
to
vanity
that
they
who
possess
it
become
intoxicated
and
lose
all
humour
is
a
different
quality
it
will
make
your
company
much
solicited
but
be
cautious
how
you
indulge
it
is
often
a
great
enemy
to
delicacy
and
a
still
greater
one
to
dignity
of
character
it
may
sometimes
gain
you
applause
but
will
never
procure
you
respect
be
even
cautious
in
displaying
your
good
sense
it
will
be
thought
you
assume
a
superiority
over
the
rest
of
the
but
if
you
happen
to
have
any
learning
keep
it
a
profound
secret
especially
from
the
men
who
generally
look
with
a
jealous
and
malignant
eye
on
a
woman
of
great
parts
and
a
cultivated
understanding
a
man
of
real
genius
and
candour
is
far
superior
to
this
meanness
but
such
a
one
will
seldom
fall
in
your
way
and
if
by
accident
he
should
do
not
be
anxious
to
show
the
full
extent
of
your
knowledge
if
he
has
any
opportunities
of
seeing
you
he
will
soon
discover
it
himself
and
if
you
have
any
advantages
of
person
or
manner
and
keep
your
own
secret
he
will
probably
give
you
credit
for
a
great
deal
more
than
you
the
great
art
of
pleasing
in
conversation
consists
in
making
the
company
pleased
with
themselves
you
will
more
readily
hear
than
talk
yourselves
into
their
good
graces
beware
of
detraction
especially
where
your
own
sex
are
concerned
you
are
generally
accused
of
being
particularly
addicted
to
this
vice
i
think
men
are
fully
as
guilty
of
it
when
their
interests
as
your
interests
more
frequently
clash
and
as
your
feelings
are
quicker
than
ours
your
temptations
to
it
are
more
frequent
for
this
reason
be
particularly
tender
of
the
reputation
of
your
own
sex
especially
when
they
happen
to
rival
you
in
our
regards
we
look
on
this
as
the
strongest
proof
of
dignity
and
true
greatness
of
mind
show
a
compassionate
sympathy
to
unfortunate
women
especially
to
those
who
are
rendered
so
by
the
villany
of
men
indulge
a
secret
pleasure
i
may
say
pride
in
being
the
friends
and
refuge
of
the
unhappy
but
without
the
vanity
of
showing
it
consider
every
species
of
indelicacy
in
conversation
as
shameful
in
itself
and
as
highly
disgusting
to
us
all
double
is
of
this
the
dissoluteness
of
men
s
education
allows
them
to
be
diverted
with
a
kind
of
wit
which
yet
they
have
delicacy
enough
to
be
shocked
at
when
it
comes
from
your
mouths
or
even
when
you
hear
it
without
pain
and
virgin
purity
is
of
that
delicate
nature
that
it
can
not
hear
certain
things
without
contamination
it
is
always
in
your
power
to
avoid
these
no
man
but
a
brute
or
a
fool
will
insult
a
woman
with
conversation
which
he
sees
gives
her
pain
nor
will
he
dare
to
do
it
if
she
resent
the
injury
with
a
becoming
there
is
a
dignity
in
conscious
virtue
which
is
able
to
awe
the
most
shameless
and
abandoned
of
men
you
will
be
reproached
perhaps
with
prudery
by
prudery
is
usually
meant
an
affectation
of
delicacy
now
i
do
not
wish
you
to
affect
delicacy
i
wish
you
to
possess
it
at
any
rate
it
is
better
to
run
the
risk
of
being
thought
ridiculous
than
disgusting
the
men
will
complain
of
your
reserve
they
will
assure
you
that
a
franker
behaviour
would
make
you
more
amiable
but
trust
me
they
are
not
sincere
when
they
tell
you
i
acknowledge
that
on
some
occasions
it
might
render
you
more
agreeable
as
companions
but
it
would
make
you
less
amiable
as
women
an
important
distinction
which
many
of
your
sex
are
not
aware
after
all
i
wish
you
to
have
great
ease
and
openness
in
your
conversation
i
only
point
out
some
considerations
which
ought
to
regulate
your
behaviour
in
that
respect
have
a
sacred
regard
to
truth
lying
is
a
mean
and
despicable
i
have
known
some
women
of
excellent
parts
who
were
so
much
addicted
to
it
that
they
could
not
be
trusted
in
the
relation
of
any
story
especially
if
it
contained
any
thing
of
the
marvellous
or
if
they
themselves
were
the
heroines
of
the
tale
this
weakness
did
not
proceed
from
a
bad
heart
but
was
merely
the
effect
of
vanity
or
an
unbridled
i
do
not
mean
to
censure
that
lively
embellishment
of
a
humourous
story
which
is
only
intended
to
promote
innocent
mirth
there
is
a
certain
gentleness
of
spirit
and
manners
extremely
engaging
in
your
sex
not
that
indiscriminate
attention
that
unmeaning
simper
which
smiles
on
all
alike
this
arises
either
from
an
affectation
of
softness
or
from
perfect
insipidity
there
is
a
species
of
refinement
in
luxury
just
beginning
to
prevail
among
the
gentlemen
of
this
country
to
which
our
ladies
are
yet
as
great
strangers
as
any
women
upon
earth
i
hope
for
the
honour
of
the
sex
they
may
ever
continue
so
i
mean
the
luxury
of
eating
it
is
a
despicable
selfish
vice
in
men
but
in
your
sex
it
is
beyond
expression
indelicate
and
disgusting
every
one
who
remembers
a
few
years
back
is
sensible
of
a
very
striking
change
in
the
attention
and
respect
formerly
paid
by
the
gentlemen
to
the
ladies
their
are
deserted
and
after
dinner
and
supper
the
gentlemen
are
impatient
till
they
retire
how
they
came
to
lose
this
respect
which
nature
and
politeness
so
well
entitle
them
to
i
shall
not
here
particularly
inquire
the
revolutions
of
manners
in
any
country
depend
on
causes
very
various
and
complicated
i
shall
only
observe
that
the
behaviour
of
the
ladies
in
the
last
age
was
very
reserved
and
stately
it
would
now
be
reckoned
ridiculously
stiff
and
formal
whatever
it
was
it
had
certainly
the
effect
of
making
them
more
respected
a
fine
woman
like
other
fine
things
in
nature
has
her
proper
point
of
view
from
which
she
may
be
seen
to
most
advantage
to
fix
this
point
requires
great
judgment
and
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
by
the
present
mode
of
female
manners
the
ladies
seem
to
expect
that
they
shall
regain
their
ascendency
over
us
by
the
fullest
display
of
their
personal
charms
by
being
always
in
our
eye
at
public
places
by
conversing
with
us
with
the
same
unreserved
freedom
as
we
do
with
one
another
in
short
by
resembling
us
as
nearly
as
they
possibly
but
a
little
time
and
experience
will
show
the
folly
of
this
expectation
and
conduct
the
power
of
a
fine
woman
over
the
hearts
of
men
of
men
of
the
finest
parts
is
even
beyond
what
she
conceives
they
are
sensible
of
the
pleasing
illusion
but
they
can
not
nor
do
they
wish
to
dissolve
it
but
if
she
is
determined
to
dispel
the
charm
it
certainly
is
in
her
power
she
may
soon
reduce
the
angel
to
a
very
ordinary
girl
there
is
a
native
dignity
in
ingenuous
modesty
to
be
expected
in
your
sex
which
is
your
natural
protection
from
the
familiarities
of
the
men
and
which
you
should
feel
previous
to
the
reflexion
that
it
is
your
interest
to
keep
yourselves
sacred
from
all
personal
freedoms
the
many
nameless
charms
and
endearments
of
beauty
should
be
reserved
to
bless
the
arms
of
the
happy
man
to
whom
you
give
your
heart
but
who
if
he
has
the
least
delicacy
will
despise
them
if
he
knows
that
they
have
been
prostituted
to
fifty
men
before
the
sentiment
that
a
woman
may
allow
all
innocent
freedoms
provided
her
virtue
is
secure
is
both
grossly
indelicate
and
dangerous
and
has
proved
fatal
to
many
of
your
sex
let
me
now
recommend
to
your
attention
that
elegance
which
is
not
so
much
a
quality
itself
as
the
high
polish
of
every
other
it
is
what
diffuses
an
ineffable
grace
over
every
look
every
motion
every
sentence
you
utter
it
gives
that
charm
to
beauty
without
which
it
generally
fails
to
please
it
is
partly
a
personal
quality
in
which
respect
it
is
the
gift
of
nature
but
i
speak
of
it
principally
as
a
quality
of
the
mind
in
a
word
it
is
the
perfection
of
taste
in
life
and
manners
every
virtue
and
every
excellency
in
their
most
graceful
and
amiable
forms
you
may
perhaps
think
that
i
want
to
throw
every
spark
of
nature
out
of
your
composition
and
to
make
you
entirely
artificial
far
from
it
i
wish
you
to
possess
the
most
perfect
simplicity
of
heart
and
manners
i
think
you
may
possess
dignity
without
pride
affability
without
meanness
and
simple
elegance
without
affectation

the

of

that
when
a

speaks
of
her

fatigue
we
recoil
at
the
description
in
a
way
she
is
little
aware
of

of
your

taught
knitting

such
like
is
not
on

of

enable
you
to
judge
more
perfectly
of
that
kind
of
work
and

direct

execution
of
it

another
principal
end
is
to
enable
you

to
have
your
pleasures
as
independent

possible

a

province
and

a
variety

subjects
for
the
exertion
both
of
good
sense
and
good
taste
if
you
ever
come
to
have
the
charge
of
a
family
it
ought
to
engage
much
of
your
time
and
attention
nor
can
you
be
excused
from
this
by
any
extent
of
fortune
though
with
a
narrow
one
the
ruin
that
follows
the
neglect
of

may
be
more
immediate
i
am
at
the
greatest
loss
what
to
advise
you
in
regard
to
books
there
is
no
impropriety
in
your
reading
history
or
cultivating
any
art
or
science
to
which
genius
or
accident
lead
you
the
whole
volume
of
nature
lies
open
to
your
eye
and
furnishes
an
infinite
variety
of
entertainment
if
i
was
sure
that
nature
had
given
you
such
strong
principles
of
taste
and
sentiment
as
would
remain
with
you
and
influence
your
future
conduct
with
the
utmost
pleasure
would
i
endeavour
to
direct
your
reading
in
such
a
way
as
might
form
that
taste
to
the
utmost
perfection
of
truth
and
elegance
but
when
i
reflect
how
easy
it
is
to
warm
a
girl
s
imagination
and
how
difficult
deeply
and
permanently
to
affect
her
heart
how
readily
she
enters
into
every
refinement
of
sentiment
and
how
easily
she
can
sacrifice
them
to
vanity
or
convenience
i
think
i
may
very
probably
do
you
an
injury
by
artificially
creating
a
taste
which
if
nature
never
gave
it
you
would
only
serve
to
embarrass
your
future
i
do
not
want
to
you
any
thing
i
want
to
know
what
nature
has
made
you
and
to
perfect
you
on
her
plan
i
do
not
wish
you
to
have
sentiments
that
might
perplex
you
i
wish
you
to
have
sentiments
that
may
uniformly
and
steadily
guide

as
your

so
thoroughly
approve
that
you
would
not

for
any
consideration
this
world
could
offer
dress
is
an
important
article
in
female
life
the
love
of
dress
is
natural
to
you
and
therefore
it
is
proper
and
reasonable
good
sense
will
regulate
your
expence
in
it
and
good
taste
will
direct
you
to
dress
in
such
a
way
as
to
conceal
any
blemishes
and
set
off
your
beauties
if
you
have
any
to
the
greatest
advantage
but
much
delicacy
and
judgment
are
required
in
the
application
of
this
rule
a
fine
woman
shows
her
charms
to
most
advantage
when
she
seems
most
to
conceal
them
the
finest
bosom
in
nature
is
not
so
fine
as
what
imagination
forms
the
most
perfect
elegance
of
dress
appears
always
the
most
easy
and
the
least
studied
do
not
confine
your
attention
to
dress
to
your
public
appearances
accustom
yourselves
to
an
habitual
neatness
so
that
in
the
most
careless
undress
in
your
most
unguarded
hours
you
may
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
your
you
will
not
easily
believe
how
much
we
consider
your
dress
as
expressive
of
your
characters
vanity
levity
slovenliness
folly
appear
through
it
an
elegant
simplicity
is
an
equal
proof
of
taste
and
delicacy
in
dancing
the
principal
points
you
are
to
attend
to
are
ease
and
grace
i
would
have
you
to
dance
with
spirit
but
never
allow
yourselves
to
be
so
far
transported
with
mirth
as
to
forget
the
delicacy
of
your
many
a
girl
dancing
in
the
gaiety
and
innocence
of
her
heart
is
thought
to
discover
a
spirit
she
little
dreams
of
i
know
no
entertainment
that
gives
such
pleasure
to
any
person
of
sentiment
or
humour
as
the
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
there
are
few
english
comedies
a
lady
can
see
without
a
shock
to
delicacy
you
will
not
readily
suspect
the
comments
gentlemen
make
on
your
behaviour
on
such
occasions
men
are
often
best
acquainted
with
the
most
worthless
of
your
sex
and
from
them
too
readily
form
their
judgement
of
the
rest
a
virtuous
girl
often
hears
very
indelicate
things
with
a
countenance
embarrassed
because
in
truth
she
does
not
understand
them
yet
this
is
most
ungenerously
ascribed
to
that
command
of
features
and
that
ready
presence
of
mind
which
you
are
thought
to
possess
in
a
degree
far
beyond
us
or
by
still
more
malignant
observers
it
is
ascribed
to
hardened
effrontery
sometimes
a
girl
laughs
with
all
the
simplicity
of
unsuspecting
innocence
for
no
other
reason
but
being
infected
with
other
people
s
laughing
she
is
then
believed
to
know
more
than
she
should
if
she
does
happen
to
understand
an
improper
thing
she
suffers
a
very
complicated
distress
she
feels
her
modesty
hurt
in
the
most
sensible
manner
and
at
the
same
time
is
ashamed
of
appearing
conscious
of
the
injury
the
only
way
to
avoid
these
inconveniencies
is
never
to
go
to
a
play
that
is
particularly
offensive
to
tragedy
subjects
you
to
no
such
its
sorrows
will
soften
and
ennoble
your
hearts
i
need
say
little
about
gaming
the
ladies
in
this
country
being
as
yet
almost
strangers
to
it
is
a
ruinous
and
incurable
vice
and
as
it
leads
to
all
the
selfish
and
turbulent
passions
is
peculiarly
odious
in
your
sex
i
have
no
objection
to
your
playing
a
little
at
any
kind
of
game
as
a
variety
in
your
amusements
provided
that
what
you
can
possibly
lose
is
such
a
trifle
as
can
neither
interest
you
nor
hurt
you
in
this
as
well
as
in
all
important
points
of
conduct
show
a
determined
resolution
and
steadiness
this
is
not
in
the
least
inconsistent
with
that
softness
and
gentleness
so
amiable
in
your
sex
on
the
contrary
it
gives
that
spirit
to
a
mild
and
sweet
disposition
without
which
it
is
apt
to
degenerate
into
insipidity
it
makes
you

in
those
who
have
shown
affection

you
were

this
is
an
obligation
for
which
you
can
not

too
when
you
read
this
you
will
naturally
think
of
your
mother

whom
you
owe
so
much
if
you
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
any
who
deserve
the
name
of
friends
unbosom
yourself
to
them
with
the
most
unsuspicious
confidence
it
is
one
of
the
world
s
maxims
never
to
trust
any
person
with
a
secret
the
discovery
of
which
could
give
you
any
pain
but
it
is
the
maxim
of
a
little
mind
and
a
cold
heart
unless
where
it
is
the
effect
of
frequent
disappointments
and
bad
usage
an
open
temper
if
restrained
but
by
tolerable
prudence
will
make
you
on
the
whole
much
happier
than
a
reserved
suspicious
one
although
you
may
sometimes
suffer
by
it
coldness
and
distrust
are
but
the
too
certain
consequences
of
age
and
experience
but
they
are
unpleasant
feelings
and
need
not
be
anticipated
before
their
time
but
however
open
you
may
be
in
talking
of
your
own
affairs
never
disclose
the
secrets
of
one
friend
to
another
these
are
sacred
deposits
which
do
not
belong
to
you
nor
have
you
any
right
to
make
use
of
them
there
is
another
case
in
which
i
suspect
it
is
proper
to
be
secret
not
so
much
from
motives
of
prudence
as
delicacy
i
mean
in
love
matters
though
a
woman
has
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
an
attachment
to
a
man
of
merit
yet
nature
whose
authority
is
superior
to
philosophy
has
annexed
a
sense
of
shame
to
it
it
is
even
long
before
a
woman
of
delicacy
dares
avow
to
her
own
heart
that
she
loves
and
when
all
the
subterfuges
of
ingenuity
to
conceal
it
from
herself
fail
she
feels
a
violence
done
both
to
her
pride
and
to
her
modesty
this
i
should
imagine
must
always
be
the
case
where
she
is
not
sure
of
a
return
to
her
attachment
in
such
a
situation
to
lay
the
heart
open
to
any
person
whatever
does
not
appear
to
me
consistent
with
the
perfection
of
female
delicacy
but
perhaps
i
am
in
the
at
the
same
time
i
must
tell
you
that
in
point
of
prudence
it
concerns
you
to
attend
well
to
the
consequences
of
such
a
discovery
these
secrets
however
important
in
your
own
estimation
may
appear
very
trifling
to
your
friend
who
possibly
will
not
enter
into
your
feelings
but
may
rather
consider
them
as
a
subject
of
pleasantry
for
this
reason
are
of
all
others
the
worst
kept
but
the
consequences
to
you
may
be
very
serious
as
no
man
of
spirit
and
delicacy
ever
valued
a
heart
much
hackneyed
in
the
ways
of
love
if
therefore
you
must
have
a
friend
to
pour
out
your
heart
to
be
sure
of
her
honour
and
secrecy
let
her
not
be
a
married
woman
especially
if
she
lives
happily
with
her
husband
there
are
certain
unguarded
moments
in
which
such
a
woman
though
the
best
and
worthiest
of
her
sex
may
let
hints
escape
which
at
other
times
or
to
any
other
person
than
her
husband
she
would
be
incapable
of
nor
will
a
husband
in
this
case
feel
himself
under
the
same
obligation
of
secrecy
and
honour
as
if
you
had
put
your
confidence
originally
in
himself
especially
on
a
subject
which
the
world
is
apt
to
treat
so
lightly
if
all
other
circumstances
are
equal
there
are
obvious
advantages
in
your
making
friends
of
one
another
the
ties
of
blood
and
your
being
so
much
united
in
one
common
interest
form
an
additional
bond
of
union
to
your
friendship
if
your
brothers
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
have
hearts
susceptible
of
friendship
to
possess
truth
honour
sense
and
delicacy
of
sentiment
they
are
the
fittest
and
most
unexceptionable
confidants
by
placing
confidence
in
them
you
will
receive
every
advantage
which
you
could
hope
for
from
the
friendship
of
men
without
any
of
the
inconveniences
that
attend
such
connexions
with
our
sex
beware
of
making
confidants
of
your
servants
dignity
not
properly
understood
very
readily
degenerates
into
pride
which
enters
into
no
friendships
because
it
can
not
bear
an
equal
and
is
so
fond
of
flattery
as
to
grasp
at
it
even
from
servants
and
dependants
the
most
ultimate
confidants
therefore
of
proud
people
are
and
show
the
utmost
humanity
to
your
servants
make
their
situation
as
comfortable
to
them
as
possible
but
if
you
make
them
your
confidants
you
spoil
them
and
debase
yourselves
never
allow
any
person
under
the
pretended
sanction
of
friendship
to
be
so
familiar
as
to
lose
a
proper
respect
for
you
never
allow
them
to
teaze
you
on
any
subject
that
is
disagreeable
or
where
you
have
once
taken
your
resolution
many
will
tell
you
that
this
reserve
is
inconsistent
with
the
freedom
which
friendship
allows
but
a
certain
respect
is
as
necessary
in
friendship
as
in
love
without
it
you
may
be
liked
as
a
child
but
you
will
never
be
beloved
as
an
equal
the
temper
and
dispositions
of
the
heart
in
your
sex
make
you
enter
more
readily
and
warmly
into
friendships
than
men
your
natural
propensity
to
it
is
so
strong
that
you
often
run
into
intimacies
which
you
soon
have
sufficient
cause
to
repent
of
and
this
makes
your
friendships
so
very
fluctuating
another
great
obstacle
to
the
sincerity
as
well
as
steadiness
of
your
friendships
is
the
great
clashing
of
your
interests
in
the
pursuits
of
love
ambition
or
vanity
for
these
reasons
it
would
appear
at
first
view
more
eligible
for
you
to
contract
your
friendships
with
the
men
among
other
obvious
advantages
of
an
easy
intercourse
between
the
two
sexes
it
occasions
an
emulation
and
exertion
in
each
to
excel
and
be
agreeable
hence
their
respective
excellencies
are
mutually
communicated
and
blended
as
their
interests
in
no
degree
interfere
there
can
be
no
foundation
for
jealousy
or
suspicion
of
rivalship
the
friendship
of
a
man
for
a
woman
is
always
blended
with
a
tenderness
which
he
never
feels
for
one
of
his
own
sex
even
where
love
is
in
no
degree
concerned
besides
we
are
conscious
of
a
natural
title
you
have
to
our
protection
and
good
offices
and
therefore
we
feel
an
additional
obligation
of
honour
to
serve
you
and
to
observe
an
inviolable
secrecy
whenever
you
confide
in
us
but
apply
these
observations
with
great
caution
thousands
of
women
of
the
best
hearts
and
finest
parts
have
been
ruined
by
men
who
approach
them
under
the
specious
name
of
friendship
but
supposing
a
man
to
have
the
most
undoubted
honour
yet
his
friendship
to
a
woman
is
so
near
to
love
that
if
she
be
very
agreeable
in
her
person
she
will
probably
very
soon
find
a
lover
where
she
only
wished
to
meet
a
let
me
here
however
warn
you
against
that
weakness
so
common
among
vain
women
the
imagination
that
every
man
who
takes
particular
notice
of
you
is
a
lover
nothing
can
expose
you
more
to
ridicule
than
the
taking
up
a
man
on
the
suspicion
of
being
your
lover
who
perhaps
never
once
thought
of
you
in
that
view
and
giving
yourselves
those
airs
so
common
among
silly
women
on
such
occasions
there
is
a
kind
of
unmeaning
gallantry
much
practised
by
some
men
which
if
you
have
any
discernment
you
will
find
really
very
harmless
men
of
this
sort
will
attend
you
to
public
places
and
be
useful
to
you
by
a
number
of
little
observances
which
those
of
a
superior
class
do
not
so
well
understand
or
have
not
leisure
to
regard
or
perhaps
are
too
proud
to
submit
to
look
on
the
compliments
of
such
men
as
words
of
course
which
they
repeat
to
every
agreeable
woman
of
their
acquaintance
there
is
a
familiarity
they
are
apt
to
assume
which
a
proper
dignity
in
your
behaviour
will
be
easily
able
to
check
there
is
a
different
species
of
men
whom
you
may
like
as
agreeable
companions
men
of
worth
taste
and
genius
whose
conversation
in
some
respects
may
be
superior
to
what
you
generally
meet
with
among
your
own
sex
it
will
be
foolish
in
you
to
deprive
yourselves
of
an
useful
and
agreeable
acquaintance
merely
because
idle
people
say
he
is
your
lover
such
a
man
may
like
your
company
without
having
any
design
on
your
person
people
whose
sentiments
and
particularly
whose
tastes
correspond
naturally
like
to
associate
together
although
neither
of
them
have
the
most
distant
view
of
any
further
connexion
but
as
this
similarity
of
minds
often
gives
rise
to
a
more
tender
attachment
than
friendship
it
will
be
prudent
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
over
yourselves
lest
your
hearts
become
too
far
engaged
before
you
are
aware
of
it
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
think
that
your
sex
at
least
in
this
part
of
the
world
have
much
of
that
sensibility
which
disposes
to
such
attachments
what
is
commonly
called
love
among
you
is
rather
gratitude
and
a
partiality
to
the
man
who
prefers
you
to
the
rest
of
your
sex
and
such
a
man
you
often
marry
with
little
of
either
personal
esteem
or
affection
indeed
without
an
unusual
share
of
natural
sensibility
and
very
peculiar
good
fortune
a
woman
in
this
country
has
very
little
probability
of
marrying
for
love
it
is
a
maxim
laid
down
among
you
and
a
very
prudent
one
it
is
that
love
is
not
to
begin
on
your
part
but
is
entirely
to
be
the
consequence
of
our
attachment
to
you
now
supposing
a
woman
to
have
sense
and
taste
she
will
not
find
many
men
to
whom
she
can
possibly
be
supposed
to
bear
any
considerable
share
of
esteem
among
these
few
it
is
very
great
chance
if
any
of
them
distinguishes
her
particularly
love
at
least
with
us
is
exceedingly
capricious
and
will
not
always
fix
where
reason
says
it
should
but
supposing
one
of
them
should
become
particularly
attached
to
her
it
is
still
extremely
improbable
that
he
should
be
the
man
in
the
world
her
heart
most
approved
of
as
therefore
nature
has
not
given
you
that
unlimited
range
in
your
choice
which
we
enjoy
she
has
wisely
and
benevolently
assigned
to
you
a
greater
flexibility
of
taste
on
this
subject
some
agreeable
qualities
recommend
a
gentleman
to
your
common
good
liking
and
friendship
in
the
course
of
his
acquaintance
he
contracts
an
attachment
to
you
when
you
perceive
it
it
excites
your
gratitude
this
gratitude
rises
into
a
preference
and
this
preference
perhaps
at
last
advances
to
some
degree
of
attachment
especially
if
it
meets
with
crosses
and
difficulties
for
these
and
a
state
of
suspense
are
very
great
incitements
to
attachment
and
are
the
food
of
love
in
both
sexes
if
attachment
was
not
excited
in
your
sex
in
this
manner
there
is
not
one
of
a
million
of
you
that
could
ever
marry
with
any
degree
of
love
a
man
of
taste
and
delicacy
marries
a
woman
because
he
loves
her
more
than
any
other
a
woman
of
equal
taste
and
delicacy
marries
him
because
she
esteems
him
and
because
he
gives
her
that
preference
but
if
a
man
unfortunately
becomes
attached
to
a
woman
whose
heart
is
secretly
his
attachment
instead
of
obtaining
a
suitable
return
is
particularly
offensive
and
if
he
persists
to
teaze
her
he
makes
himself
equally
the
object
of
her
scorn
and
aversion
the
effects
of
love
among
men
are
diversified
by
their
different
tempers
an
artful
man
may
counterfeit
every
one
of
them
so
as
easily
to
impose
on
a
young
girl
of
an
open
generous
and
feeling
heart
if
she
is
not
extremely
on
her
guard
the
finest
parts
in
such
a
girl
may
not
always
prove
sufficient
for
her
security
the
dark
and
crooked
paths
of
cunning
are
unsearchable
and
inconceivable
to
an
honourable
and
elevated
mind
the
following
i
apprehend
are
the
most
genuine
effects
of
an
honourable
passion
among
the
men
and
the
most
difficult
to
counterfeit
a
man
of
delicacy
often
betrays
his
passion
by
his
too
great
anxiety
to
conceal
it
especially
if
he
has
little
hopes
of
success
true
love
in
all
its
stages
seeks
concealment
and
never
expects
success
it
renders
a
man
not
only
respectful
but
timid
to
the
highest
degree
in
his
behaviour
to
the
woman
he
loves
to
conceal
the
awe
he
stands
in
of
her
he
may
sometimes
affect
pleasantry
but
it
sits
awkwardly
on
him
and
he
quickly
relapses
into
seriousness
if
not
into
dulness
he
magnifies
all
her
real
perfections
in
his
imagination
and
is
either
blind
to
her
failings
or
converts
them
into
beauties
like
a
person
conscious
of
guilt
he
is
jealous
that
every
eye
observes
him
and
to
avoid
this
he
shuns
all
the
little
observances
of
common
gallantry
his
heart
and
his
character
will
be
improved
in
every
respect
by
his
attachment
his
manners
will
become
more
gentle
and
his
conversation
more
agreeable
but
diffidence
and
embarrassment
will
always
make
him
appear
to
disadvantage
in
the
company
of
his
mistress
if
the
fascination
continue
long
it
will
totally
depress
his
spirit
and
extinguish
every
active
vigorous
and
manly
principle
of
his
mind
you
will
find
this
subject
beautifully
and
pathetically
painted
in
thomson
s
spring
when
you
observe
in
a
gentleman
s
behaviour
these
marks
which
i
have
described
above
reflect
seriously
what
you
are
to
do
if
his
attachment
is
agreeable
to
you
i
leave
you
to
do
as
nature
good
sense
and
delicacy
shall
direct
you
if
you
love
him
let
me
advise
you
never
to
discover
to
him
the
full
extent
of
your
love
no
not
although
you
marry
him
that
sufficiently
shows
your
preference
which
is
all
he
is
intitled
to
know
if
he
has
delicacy
he
will
ask
for
no
stronger
proof
of
your
affection
for
your
sake
if
he
has
sense
he
will
not
ask
it
for
his
own
this
is
an
unpleasant
truth
but
it
is
my
duty
to
let
you
know
it
violent
love
can
not
subsist
at
least
can
not
be
expressed
for
any
time
together
on
both
sides
otherwise
the
certain
consequence
however
concealed
is
satiety
and
disgust
nature
in
this
case
has
laid
the
reserve
on
you
if
you
see
evident
proofs
of
a
gentleman
s
attachment
and
are
determined
to
shut
your
heart
against
him
as
you
ever
hope
to
be
used
with
generosity
by
the
person
who
shall
engage
your
own
heart
treat
him
honourably
and
humanely
do
not
let
him
linger
in
a
miserable
suspense
but
be
anxious
to
let
him
know
your
sentiments
with
regard
to
him
however
people
s
hearts
may
deceive
them
there
is
scarcely
a
person
that
can
love
for
any
time
without
at
least
some
distant
hope
of
success
if
you
really
wish
to
undeceive
a
lover
you
may
do
it
in
a
variety
of
ways
there
is
a
certain
species
of
easy
familiarity
in
your
behaviour
which
may
satisfy
him
if
he
has
any
discernment
left
that
he
has
nothing
to
hope
for
but
perhaps
your
particular
temper
may
not
admit
of
you
may
easily
show
that
you
want
to
avoid
his
company
but
if
he
is
a
man
whose
friendship
you
wish
to
preserve
you
may
not
choose
this
method
because
then
you
lose
him
in
every
you
may
get
a
common
friend
to
explain
matters
to
him
or
fall
on
many
other
devices
if
you
are
seriously
anxious
to
put
him
out
of
suspense
but
if
you
are
resolved
against
every
such
method
at
least
do
not
shun
opportunities
of
letting
him
explain
himself
if
you
do
this
you
act
barbarously
and
unjustly
if
he
brings
you
to
an
explanation
give
him
a
polite
but
resolute
and
decisive
answer
in
whatever
way
you
convey
your
sentiments
to
him
if
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
and
delicacy
he
will
give
you
no
further
trouble
nor
apply
to
your
friends
for
their
intercession
this
last
is
a
method
of
courtship
which
every
man
of
spirit
will
disdain
he
will
never
whine
nor
sue
for
your
pity
that
would
mortify
him
almost
as
much
as
your
scorn
in
short
you
may
possibly
break
such
a
heart
but
you
can
never
bend
it
great
pride
always
accompanies
delicacy
however
concealed
under
the
appearance
of
the
utmost
gentleness
and
modesty
and
is
the
passion
of
all
others
the
most
difficult
to
conquer
there
is
a
case
where
a
woman
may
coquette
justifiably
to
the
utmost
verge
which
her
conscience
will
allow
it
is
where
a
gentleman
purposely
declines
to
make
his
addresses
till
such
time
as
he
thinks
himself
perfectly
sure
of
her
consent
this
at
bottom
is
intended
to
force
a
woman
to
give
up
the
undoubted
privilege
of
her
sex
the
privilege
of
refusing
it
is
intended
to
force
her
to
explain
herself
in
effect
before
the
gentleman
deigns
to
do
it
and
by
this
means
to
oblige
her
to
violate
the
modesty
and
delicacy
of
her
sex
and
to
invert
the
clearest
order
of
nature
all
this
sacrifice
is
proposed
to
be
made
merely
to
gratify
a
most
despicable
vanity
in
a
man
who
would
degrade
the
very
woman
whom
he
wishes
to
make
his
wife
it
is
of
great
importance
to
distinguish
whether
a
gentleman
who
has
the
appearance
of
being
your
lover
delays
to
speak
explicitly
from
the
motive
i
have
mentioned
or
from
a
diffidence
inseparable
from
true
attachment
in
the
one
case
you
can
scarcely
use
him
too
ill
in
the
other
you
ought
to
use
him
with
great
kindness
and
the
greatest
kindness
you
can
show
him
if
you
are
determined
not
to
listen
to
his
addresses
is
to
let
him
know
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
know
the
many
excuses
with
which
women
endeavour
to
justify
themselves
to
the
world
and
to
their
own
consciences
when
they
act
otherwise
sometimes
they
plead
ignorance
or
at
least
uncertainty
of
the
gentleman
s
real
sentiments
that
may
sometimes
be
the
case
sometimes
they
plead
the
decorum
of
their
sex
which
enjoins
an
equal
behaviour
to
all
men
and
forbids
them
to
consider
any
man
as
a
lover
till
he
has
directly
told
them
perhaps
few
women
carry
their
ideas
of
female
delicacy
and
decorum
so
far
as
i
do
but
i
must
say
you
are
not
intitled
to
plead
the
obligation
of
these
virtues
in
opposition
to
the
superior
ones
of
gratitude
justice
and
humanity
the
man
is
intitled
to
all
these
who
prefers
you
to
the
rest
of
your
sex
and
perhaps
whose
greatest
weakness
is
this
very
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
vanity
and
the
love
of
admiration
is
so
prevailing
a
passion
among
you
that
you
may
be
considered
to
make
a
very
great
sacrifice
whenever
you
give
up
a
lover
till
every
art
of
coquetry
fails
to
keep
him
or
till
he
forces
you
to
an
explanation
you
can
be
fond
of
the
love
when
you
are
indifferent
to
or
even
when
you
despise
the
lover
but
the
deepest
and
most
artful
coquetry
is
employed
by
women
of
superior
taste
and
sense
to
engage
and
fix
the
heart
of
a
man
whom
the
world
and
whom
they
themselves
esteem
although
they
are
firmly
determined
never
to
marry
him
but
his
conversation
amuses
them
and
his
attachment
is
the
highest
gratification
to
their
vanity
nay
they
can
sometimes
be
gratified
with
the
utter
ruin
of
his
fortune
fame
and
god
forbid
i
should
ever
think
so
of
all
your
sex
i
know
many
of
them
have
principles
have
generosity
and
dignity
of
soul
that
elevate
them
above
the
worthless
vanity
i
have
been
speaking
of
such
a
woman
i
am
persuaded
may
always
convert
a
lover
if
she
can
not
give
him
her
affections
into
a
warm
and
steady
friend
provided
he
is
a
man
of
sense
resolution
and
candour
if
she
explains
herself
to
him
with
a
generous
openness
and
freedom
he
must
feel
the
stroke
as
a
man
but
he
will
likewise
bear
it
as
a
man
what
he
suffers
he
will
suffer
in
silence
every
sentiment
of
esteem
will
remain
but
love
though
it
requires
very
little
food
and
is
easily
surfeited
with
too
much
yet
it
requires
some
he
will
view
her
in
the
light
of
a
married
woman
and
though
passion
subsides
yet
a
man
of
a
candid
and
generous
heart
always
retains
a
tenderness
for
a
woman
he
has
once
loved
and
who
has
used
him
well
beyond
what
he
feels
for
any
other
of
her
sex
if
he
has
not
confided
his
own
secret
to
any
body
he
has
an
undoubted
title
to
ask
you
not
to
divulge
it
if
a
woman
chooses
to
trust
any
of
her
companions
with
her
own
unfortunate
attachments
she
may
as
it
is
her
own
affair
alone
but
if
she
has
any
generosity
or
gratitude
she
will
not
betray
a
secret
which
does
not
belong
to
her
male
coquetry
is
much
more
inexcusable
than
female
as
well
as
more
pernicious
but
it
is
rare
in
this
country
very
few
men
will
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
gain
or
retain
any
woman
s
affections
unless
they
have
views
on
them
either
of
an
honourable
or
dishonourable
kind
men
employed
in
the
pursuits
of
business
ambition
or
pleasure
will
not
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
engage
a
woman
s
affections
merely
from
the
vanity
of
conquest
and
of
triumphing
over
the
heart
of
an
innocent
and
defenceless
girl
besides
people
never
value
much
what
is
entirely
in
their
power
a
man
of
parts
sentiment
and
address
if
he
lays
aside
all
regard
to
truth
and
humanity
may
engage
the
hearts
of
fifty
women
at
the
same
time
and
may
likewise
conduct
his
coquetry
with
so
much
art
as
to
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
any
of
them
to
specify
a
single
expression
that
could
be
said
to
be
directly
expressive
of
love
this
ambiguity
of
behaviour
this
art
of
keeping
one
in
suspense
is
the
great
secret
of
coquetry
in
both
sexes
it
is
the
more
cruel
in
us
because
we
can
carry
it
what
length
we
please
and
continue
it
as
long
as
we
please
without
your
being
so
much
as
at
liberty
to
complain
or
expostulate
whereas
we
can
break
our
chain
and
force
you
to
explain
whenever
we
become
impatient
of
our
situation
i
have
insisted
the
more
particularly
on
this
subject
of
courtship
because
it
may
most
readily
happen
to
you
at
that
early
period
of
life
when
you
can
have
little
experience
or
knowledge
of
the
world
when
your
passions
are
warm
and
your
judgments
not
arrived
at
such
full
maturity
as
to
be
able
to
correct
i
wish
you
to
possess
such
high
principles
of
honour
and
generosity
as
will
render
you
incapable
of
deceiving
and
at
the
same
time
to
possess
that
acute
discernment
which
may
secure
you
against
being
deceived
a
woman
in
this
country
may
easily
prevent
the
first
impressions
of
love
and
every
motive
of
prudence
and
delicacy
should
make
her
guard
her
heart
against
them
till
such
time
as
she
has
received
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
the
attachment
of
a
man
of
such
merit
as
will
justify
a
reciprocal
regard
your
hearts
indeed
may
be
shut
inflexibly
and
permanently
against
all
the
merit
a
man
can
possess
that
may
be
your
misfortune
but
can
not
be
your
fault
in
such
a
situation
you
would
be
equally
unjust
to
yourself
and
your
lover
if
you
gave
him
your
hand
when
your
heart
revolted
against
him
but
miserable
will
be
your
fate
if
you
allow
an
attachment
to
steal
on
you
before
you
are
sure
of
a
return
or
what
is
infinitely
worse
where
there
are
wanting
those
qualities
which
alone
can
insure
happiness
in
a
married
state
i
know
nothing
that
renders
a
woman
more
despicable
than
her
thinking
it
essential
to
happiness
to
be
married
besides
the
gross
indelicacy
of
the
sentiment
it
is
a
false
one
as
thousands
of
women
have
experienced
but
if
it
was
true
the
belief
that
it
is
so
and
the
consequent
impatience
to
be
married
is
the
most
effectual
way
to
prevent
it
you
must
not
think
from
this
that
i
do
not
wish
you
to
marry
on
the
contrary
i
am
of
opinion
that
you
may
attain
a
superior
degree
of
happiness
in
a
married
state
to
what
you
can
possibly
find
in
any
other
i
know
the
forlorn
and
unprotected
situation
of
an
old
maid
the
chagrin
and
peevishness
which
are
apt
to
infect
their
tempers
and
the
great
difficulty
of
making
a
transition
with
dignity
and
cheerfulness
from
the
period
of
youth
beauty
admiration
and
respect
into
the
calm
silent
unnoticed
retreat
of
declining
years
i
see
some
unmarried
women
of
active
vigorous
minds
and
great
vivacity
of
spirits
degrading
themselves
sometimes
by
entering
into
a
dissipated
course
of
life
unsuitable
to
their
years
and
exposing
themselves
to
the
ridicule
of
girls
who
might
have
been
their
grandchildren
sometimes
by
oppressing
their
acquaintances
by
impertinent
intrusions
into
their
private
affairs
and
sometimes
by
being
the
propagators
of
scandal
and
defamation
all
this
is
owing
to
an
exuberant
activity
of
spirit
which
if
it
had
found
employment
at
home
would
have
rendered
them
respectable
and
useful
members
of
society
i
see
other
women
in
the
same
situation
gentle
modest
blessed
with
sense
taste
delicacy
and
every
milder
feminine
virtue
of
the
heart
but
of
weak
spirits
bashful
and
timid
i
see
such
women
sinking
into
obscurity
and
insignificance
and
gradually
losing
every
elegant
accomplishment
for
this
evident
reason
that
they
are
not
united
to
a
partner
who
has
sense
and
worth
and
taste
to
know
their
value
one
who
is
able
to
draw
forth
their
concealed
qualities
and
show
them
to
advantage
who
can
give
that
support
to
their
feeble
spirits
which
they
stand
so
much
in
need
of
and
who
by
his
affection
and
tenderness
might
make
such
a
woman
happy
in
exerting
every
talent
and
accomplishing
herself
in
every
elegant
art
that
could
contribute
to
his
amusement
in
short
i
am
of
opinion
that
a
married
state
if
entered
into
from
proper
motives
of
esteem
and
affection
will
be
the
happiest
for
yourselves
make
you
most
respectable
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
the
most
useful
members
of
society
but
i
confess
i
am
not
enough
of
a
patriot
to
wish
you
to
marry
for
the
good
of
the
public
i
wish
you
to
marry
for
no
other
reason
but
to
make
yourselves
happier
when
i
am
so
particular
in
my
advices
about
your
conduct
i
own
my
heart
beats
with
the
fond
hope
of
making
you
worthy
the
attachment
of
men
who
will
deserve
you
and
be
sensible
of
your
merit
but
heaven
forbid
you
should
ever
relinquish
the
ease
and
independence
of
a
single
life
to
become
the
slaves
of
a
fool
or
tyrant
s
caprice
as
these
have
always
been
my
sentiments
i
shall
do
you
but
justice
when
i
leave
you
in
such
independent
circumstances
as
may
lay
you
under
no
temptation
to
do
from
necessity
what
you
would
never
do
from
this
will
likewise
save
you
from
that
cruel
mortification
to
a
woman
of
spirit
the
suspicion
that
a
gentleman
thinks
he
does
you
an
honour
or
a
favour
when
he
asks
you
for
his
wife
if
i
live
till
you
arrive
at
that
age
when
you
shall
be
capable
to
judge
for
yourselves
and
do
not
strangely
alter
my
sentiments
i
shall
act
towards
you
in
a
very
different
manner
from
what
most
parents
do
my
opinion
has
always
been
that
when
that
period
arrives
the
parental
authority
ceases
i
hope
i
shall
always
treat
you
with
that
affection
and
easy
confidence
which
may
dispose
you
to
look
on
me
as
your
friend
in
that
capacity
alone
i
shall
think
myself
intitled
to
give
you
my
opinion
in
the
doing
of
which
i
should
think
myself
highly
criminal
if
i
did
not
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
endeavour
to
divest
myself
of
all
personal
vanity
and
all
prejudices
in
favour
of
my
particular
taste
if
you
did
not
choose
to
follow
my
advice
i
should
not
on
that
account
cease
to
love
you
as
my
children
though
my
right
to
your
obedience
was
expired
yet
i
should
think
nothing
could
release
me
from
the
ties
of
nature
and
humanity
you
may
perhaps
imagine
that
the
reserved
behaviour
which
i
recommend
to
you
and
your
appearing
seldom
at
public
places
must
cut
off
all
opportunities
of
your
being
acquainted
with
gentlemen
i
am
very
far
from
intending
this
i
advise
you
to
no
reserve
but
what
will
render
you
more
respected
and
beloved
by
our
sex
i
do
not
think
public
places
suited
to
make
people
acquainted
together
they
can
only
be
distinguished
there
by
their
looks
and
external
behaviour
but
it
is
in
private
companies
alone
where
you
can
expect
easy
and
agreeable
conversation
which
i
should
never
wish
you
to
decline
if
you
do
not
allow
gentlemen
to
become
acquainted
with
you
you
can
never
expect
to
marry
with
attachment
on
either
love
is
very
seldom
produced
at
first
sight
at
least
it
must
have
in
that
case
a
very
unjustifiable
foundation
true
love
is
founded
on
esteem
in
a
correspondence
of
tastes
and
sentiments
and
steals
on
the
heart
imperceptibly
there
is
one
advice
i
shall
leave
you
to
which
i
beg
your
particular
attention
before
your
affections
come
to
be
in
the
least
engaged
to
any
man
examine
your
tempers
your
tastes
and
your
hearts
very
severely
and
settle
in
your
own
minds
what
are
the
requisites
to
your
happiness
in
a
married
state
and
as
it
is
almost
impossible
that
you
should
get
every
thing
you
wish
come
to
a
steady
determination
what
you
are
to
consider
as
essential
and
what
may
be
sacrificed
if
you
have
hearts
disposed
by
nature
for
love
and
friendship
and
possess
those
feelings
which
enable
you
to
enter
into
all
the
refinements
and
delicacies
of
these
attachments
consider
well
for
heaven
s
sake
and
as
you
value
your
future
happiness
before
you
give
them
any
indulgence
if
you
have
the
misfortune
for
a
very
great
misfortune
it
commonly
is
to
your
sex
to
have
such
a
temper
and
such
sentiments
deeply
rooted
in
you
if
you
have
spirit
and
resolution
to
resist
the
solicitations
of
vanity
the
persecution
of
friends
for
you
will
have
lost
the
only
friend
that
would
never
persecute
you
and
can
support
the
prospect
of
the
many
inconveniencies
attending
the
state
of
an
old
maid
which
i
formerly
pointed
out
then
you
may
indulge
yourselves
in
that
kind
of
sentimental
reading
and
conversation
which
is
most
correspondent
to
your
feelings
but
if
you
find
on
a
strict
that
marriage
is
absolutely
essential
to
your
happiness
keep
the
secret
inviolable
in
your
own
bosoms
for
the
reason
i
formerly
mentioned
but
shun
as
you
would
do
the
most
fatal
poison
all
that
species
of
reading
and
conversation
which
warms
the
imagination
which
engages
and
softens
the
heart
and
raises
the
taste
above
the
level
of
common
life
if
you
do
otherwise
consider
the
terrible
conflict
of
passions
this
may
afterwards
raise
in
your
breasts
if
this
refinement
once
takes
deep
root
in
your
minds
and
you
do
not
obey
its
dictates
but
marry
from
vulgar
and
mercenary
views
you
may
never
be
able
to
eradicate
it
entirely
and
then
it
will
embitter
all
your
married
days
instead
of
meeting
with
sense
delicacy
tenderness
a
lover
a
friend
an
equal
companion
in
a
husband
you
may
be
tired
with
insipidity
and
dulness
shocked
with
indelicacy
or
mortified
by
indifference
you
will
find
none
to
compassionate
or
even
understand
your
sufferings
for
your
husbands
may
not
use
you
cruelly
and
may
give
you
as
much
money
for
your
clothes
personal
expense
and
domestic
necessaries
as
is
suitable
to
their
fortunes
the
world
would
therefore
look
on
you
as
unreasonable
women
and
that
did
not
deserve
to
be
happy
if
you
were
not
to
avoid
these
complicated
evils
if
you
are
determined
at
all
events
to
marry
i
would
advise
you
to
make
all
your
reading
and
amusements
of
such
a
kind
as
do
not
affect
the
heart
nor
the
imagination
except
in
the
way
of
wit
or
humour
i
have
no
view
by
these
advices
to
lead
your
tastes
i
only
want
to
persuade
you
of
the
necessity
of
knowing
your
own
minds
which
though
seemingly
very
easy
is
what
your
sex
seldom
attain
on
many
important
occasions
in
life
but
particularly
on
this
of
which
i
am
speaking
there
is
not
a
quality
i
more
anxiously
wish
you
to
possess
than
that
collected
decisive
spirit
which
rests
on
itself
which
enables
you
to
see
where
your
true
happiness
lies
and
to
pursue
it
with
the
most
determined
resolution
in
matters
of
business
follow
the
advice
of
those
who
know
them
better
than
yourselves
and
in
whose
integrity
you
can
confide
but
in
matters
of
taste
that
depend
on
your
own
feelings
consult
no
one
friend
whatever
but
consult
your
own
hearts
if
a
gentleman
makes
his
addresses
to
you
or
gives
you
reason
to
believe
he
will
do
so
before
you
allow
your
affections
to
be
engaged
endeavour
in
the
most
prudent
and
secret
manner
to
procure
from
your
friends
every
necessary
piece
of
information
concerning
him
such
as
his
character
for
sense
his
morals
his
temper
fortune
and
family
whether
it
is
distinguished
for
parts
and
worth
or
for
folly
knavery
and
loathsome
hereditary
diseases
when
your
friends
inform
you
of
these
they
have
fulfilled
their
duty
if
they
go
further
they
have
not
that
deference
for
you
which
a
becoming
dignity
on
your
part
would
effectually
command
whatever
your
views
are
in
marrying
take
every
possible
precaution
to
prevent
their
being
disappointed
if
fortune
and
the
pleasure
it
brings
are
your
aim
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
settlements
of
a
jointure
and
children
s
provisions
be
ample
and
properly
secured
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
enjoy
the
fortune
during
your
own
life
the
principal
security
you
can
have
for
this
will
depend
on
your
marrying
a
generous
man
who
despises
money
and
who
will
let
you
live
where
you
can
best
enjoy
that
pleasure
that
pomp
and
parade
of
life
for
which
you
married
him
from
what
i
have
said
you
will
easily
see
that
i
could
never
pretend
to
advise
whom
you
should
marry
but
i
can
with
great
confidence
advise
whom
you
should
not
marry
avoid
a
companion
that
may
entail
any
hereditary
disease
on
your
posterity
particularly
that
most
dreadful
of
all
human
calamities
madness
it
is
the
height
of
imprudence
to
run
into
such
a
danger
and
in
my
opinion
highly
criminal
do
not
marry
a
fool
he
is
the
most
intractable
of
all
animals
he
is
led
by
his
passions
and
caprices
and
is
incapable
of
hearing
the
voice
of
reason
it
may
probably
too
hurt
your
vanity
to
have
husbands
for
whom
you
have
reason
to
blush
and
tremble
every
time
they
open
their
lips
in
company
but
the
worst
circumstance
that
attends
a
fool
is
his
constant
jealousy
of
his
wife
being
thought
to
govern
him
this
renders
it
impossible
to
lead
him
and
he
is
continually
doing
absurd
and
disagreeable
things
for
no
other
reason
but
to
show
he
dares
do
them
a
rake
is
always
a
suspicious
husband
because
he
has
only
known
the
most
worthless
of
your
sex
he
likewise
entails
the
worst
diseases
on
his
wife
and
children
if
he
has
the
misfortune
to
have
any
if
you
have
a
sense
of
religion
yourselves
do
not
think
of
husbands
who
have
none
if
they
have
tolerable
understandings
they
will
be
glad
that
you
have
religion
for
their
own
sakes
and
for
the
sake
of
their
families
but
it
will
sink
you
in
their
esteem
if
they
are
weak
men
they
will
be
continually
teasing
and
shocking
you
about
your
if
you
have
children
you
will
suffer
the
most
bitter
distress
in
seeing
all
your
endeavours
to
form
their
minds
to
virtue
and
piety
all
your
endeavours
to
secure
their
present
and
eternal
happiness
frustrated
and
turned
into
ridicule
as
i
look
on
your
choice
of
a
husband
to
be
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
your
happiness
i
hope
you
will
make
it
with
the
utmost
circumspection
do
not
give
way
to
a
sudden
sally
of
passion
and
dignify
it
with
the
name
of
genuine
love
is
not
founded
in
caprice
it
is
founded
in
nature
on
honourable
views
on
virtue
on
similarity
of
tastes
and
sympathy
of
souls
if
you
have
these
sentiments
you
will
never
marry
any
one
when
you
are
not
in
that
situation
in
point
of
fortune
which
is
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
either
of
you
what
that
competency
may
be
can
only
be
determined
by
your
own
tastes
it
would
be
ungenerous
in
you
to
take
advantage
of
a
lover
s
attachment
to
plunge
him
into
distress
and
if
he
has
any
honour
no
personal
gratification
will
ever
tempt
him
to
enter
into
any
connexion
which
will
render
you
unhappy
if
you
have
as
much
between
you
as
to
satisfy
all
your
demands
it
is
sufficient
i
shall
conclude
with
endeavouring
to
remove
a
difficulty
which
must
naturally
occur
to
any
woman
of
reflexion
on
the
subject
of
marriage
what
is
to
become
of
all
those
refinements
of
delicacy
that
dignity
of
manners
which
checked
all
familiarities
and
suspended
desire
in
respectful
and
awful
admiration
in
answer
to
this
i
shall
only
observe
that
if
motives
of
interest
or
vanity
have
had
any
share
in
your
resolutions
to
marry
none
of
these
chimerical
notions
will
give
you
any
pain
nay
they
will
very
quickly
appear
as
ridiculous
in
your
own
eyes
as
they
probably
always
did
in
the
eyes
of
your
husbands
they
have
been
sentiments
which
have
floated
in
your
imaginations
but
have
never
reached
your
hearts
but
if
these
sentiments
have
been
truly
genuine
and
if
you
have
had
the
singular
happy
fate
to
attach
those
who
understand
them
you
have
no
reason
to
be
afraid
marriage
indeed
will
at
once
dispel
the
enchantment
raised
by
external
beauty
but
the
virtues
and
graces
that
first
warmed
the
heart
that
reserve
and
delicacy
which
always
left
the
lover
something
further
to
wish
and
often
made
him
doubtful
of
your
sensibility
or
attachment
may
and
ought
ever
to
remain
the
tumult
of
passion
will
necessarily
subside
but
it
will
be
succeeded
by
an
endearment
that
affects
the
heart
in
a
more
equal
more
sensible
and
tender
but
i
must
check
myself
and
not
indulge
in
descriptions
that
may
mislead
you
and
that
too
sensibly
awake
the
remembrance
of
my
happier
days
which
perhaps
it
were
better
for
me
to
forget
for
ever
i
have
thus
given
you
my
opinion
on
some
of
the
most
important
articles
of
your
future
life
chiefly
calculated
for
that
period
when
you
are
just
entering
the
world
i
have
endeavoured
to
avoid
some
peculiarities
of
opinion
which
from
their
contradiction
to
the
general
practice
of
the
world
i
might
reasonably
have
suspected
were
not
so
well
founded
but
in
writing
to
you
i
am
afraid
my
heart
has
been
too
full
and
too
warmly
interested
to
allow
me
to
keep
this
resolution
this
may
have
produced
some
embarrassment
and
some
seeming
contradictions
what
i
have
written
has
been
the
amusement
of
some
solitary
hours
and
has
served
to
divert
some
melancholy
i
am
conscious
i
undertook
a
task
to
which
i
was
very
unequal
but
i
have
discharged
a
part
of
my
you
will
at
least
be
pleased
with
