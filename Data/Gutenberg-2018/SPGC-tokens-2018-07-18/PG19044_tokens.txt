biographical

most
noble
and
you
eminent
proctors
a
citizen
of
britain
is
before
you
once
a
student
in
this
university
now
better
known
to
the
people
of
the
new
world
than
to
our
own
this
is
the
man
who
fifteen
years
ago
went
to
the
coast
of
labrador
to
succor
with
medical
aid
the
solitary
fishermen
of
the
northern
sea
in
executing
which
service
he
despised
the
perils
of
the
ocean
which
are
there
most
terrible
in
order
to
bring
comfort
and
light
to
the
wretched
and
sorrowing
thus
up
to
the
measure
of
human
ability
he
seems
to
follow
if
it
is
right
to
say
it
of
any
one
in
the
footsteps
of
christ
himself
as
a
truly
christian
man
rightly
then
we
praise
him
by
whose
praise
not
he
alone
but
our
university
also
is
honored
i
present
to
you
wilfred
thomason
grenfell
that
he
may
be
admitted
to
the
degree
of
doctor
in
medicine
honoris
causa
thus
may
be
rendered
the
latin
address
when
in
may
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
university
of
oxford
conferred
the
honorary
degree
in
medicine
with
these
fitting
words
was
presented
a
man
whose
simple
faith
has
been
the
motive
power
of
his
works
to
whom
pain
and
weariness
of
flesh
have
called
no
stay
since
there
was
discouragement
never
to
whom
personal
danger
has
counted
as
nothing
since
fear
is
incomprehensible
as
the
lord
wills
whether
for
wreck
or
service
i
am
about
his
business
on
november
of
the
preceding
year
the
king

laid
a
firm
foundation
for
his
career
and
in
surroundings
which
fitted
him
for
it
on
both
sides
of
his
inheritance
have
been
exhibited
the
courage
patience
persistence
and
fighting
and
teaching
qualities
which
are
exemplified
in
his
own
abilities
to
command
to
administer
and
to
uplift

his
father
side

the
grenvilles
who
made
good

together
they
made

has
the
strain
died
out

is
demonstrated
in
the
present
generation
by
many
of

among
them

by

grenfell

after
a
brilliant

at

master
of

a
position
which
he
resigned
in
to
become

of

he
was
a

the

and
controlling
genius
parkgate
at
one
time
a
seaport
of
renown
when
liverpool
was
still
unimportant
and
later
a
seaside
health
resort
to
which
came
the
fashion
and
beauty
of
england
had
fallen
through
the
silting
of
the
estuary
and
the
broadening
of
the
sands
of
dee
to
the
level
of
a
hamlet
in
the
time
of
grenfell
boyhood
the
broad
stretch
of
seaward
trending
sand
with
its
interlacing
rivulets
of
fresh
and
brackish
water
made
a
tempting
though
treacherous
playground
alluring
alike
in
the
varied
forms
of
life
it
harbored
and
in
the
adventure
which
whetted
exploration
thither
came
charles
kingsley
canon
of
chester
who
married
a
grenfell
and
who
coupled
his
verse
with
scientific
study
and
made
geological
excursions
to
the
mouth
with
the
then
master
of
mostyn
house
school
in
these
excursions
the
youthful
wilfred
was
a
participant
and
therein
he
learned
some
of
his
first
lessons
in
that
accuracy
of
observation
essential
to
his
later
life
work
here
in
this
trained
but
untrammeled
boyhood
with
an
inherited
incentive
to
labor
and
an
educated
thirst
for
knowledge
away
from
the
thrall
of
crowded
communities
close
to
the
wild
places
of
nature
with
the
sea
always
beckoning
and
a
rocking
boat
as
familiar
as
the
land
it
is
small
wonder
that
there
grew
the
fashioning
of
the
purpose
of
a
man
dimly
at
first
conceived
in
a
home
in
which
all
both
of
tradition
and
of
teaching
bred
faith
reverence
and
the
sense
of
thanksgiving
in
usefulness
from
the
at
parkgate
came
the
step
to
marlborough
college
where
three
years
were
marked
by
earnest
study
both
in
books
and
in
play
for
the
one
gained
a
scholarship
and
the
other
an
enduring
interest
in
rugby
football
matriculating
later
at
the
university
of
london
grenfell
entered
the
london
hospital
and
there
laid
not
only
the
foundation
of
his
medical
education
but
that
of
his
friendship
with
sir
frederick
treves
renowned
surgeon
and
daring
sailor
and
master
mariner
as
well
with
plenty
of
work
to
the
fore
as
a
hospital
interne
the
ruling
spirit
still
asserted
itself
and
the
young
doctor
became
an
inspiration
among
the
waifs
of
the
teeming
city
he
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
great
lads
brigades
which
have
done
much
good
and
fostered
more
in
the
example
that
they
have
set
for
allied
activities
nor
were
the
needs
of
his
own
bodily
machine
neglected
football
rowing
and
the
tennis
court
kept
him
in
condition
and
his
athletics
served
to
strengthen
his
appeals
to
the
london
boys
whom
he
enrolled
in
the
brigades
he
founded
the
rowing
club
at
putney
and
rowed
in
the
first
race
he
played
on
the
varsity
football
team
and
won
the
throwing
the
hammer
at
the
sports
a
couple
of
terms
at
queen
college
oxford
followed
the
london
experience
but
here
the
conditions
were
too
easy
and
luxurious
for
one
who
by
both
inheritance
and
training
had
within
him
the
incentive
to
the
strenuous
life
need
called
misery
appealed
the
message
of
life
of
hope
and
of
salvation
awaited
and
the
young
doctor
turned
from
oxford
to
the
medical
mission
work
in
which
his
record
stands
among
the
foremost
for
its
effectiveness
and
for
the
spirituality
of
its
purpose
seeking
some
way
in
which
he
could
satisfy
his
medical
aspirations
as
well
as
his
desire
for
adventure
and
for
definite
christian
work
he
appealed
to
sir
frederick
treves
a
member
of
the
council
of
the
royal
national
mission
to
deep
sea
fishermen
who
suggested
his
joining
the
staff
of
the
mission
and
establishing
a
medical
mission
to
the
fishermen
of
the
north
sea
the
conditions
of
the
life
were
onerous
the
existing
traffic
in
spirituous
liquors
and
in
all
other
demoralizing
influences
had
to
be
fought
step
by
step
prejudice
and
evil
habit
had
to
be
overcome
and
to
be
replaced
by
better
knowledge
and
better
desire
there
was
room
for
both
fighting
and
teaching
and
the
medical
mission
won
its
way
when
you
set
out
to
commend
your
gospel
to
men
who
do
want
it
there
only
one
way
to
go
about
it
to
do
something
for
them
that
they
be
sure
to
understand
the
message
of
love
that
was
flesh
and
dwelt
amongst
men
must
be
reincarnate
in
our
lives
if
it
is
to
be
received
thus
came
about
the
outfitting
of
the
albert
to
carry
the
message
and
the
help
by
cruising
among
the
fleets
on
the
and
the
organization
of
the
deep
sea
mission
when
this
work
was
done
when
the
fight
had
gone
out
of
it
grenfell
looked
for
another
field
for
yet
another
need
and
found
it
on
that
barren
and
inhospitable
coast
the
labrador
whose
only
harvest
field
is
the
sea
six
hundred
miles
of
almost
barren
rock
with
outlying
uncharted
ledges
worn
smooth
by
ice
else
still
more
vessels
would
have
found
wreckage
there
a
scant
constant
population
of
hardy
fishermen
and
their
families
pious
and
most
of
them
but
largely
at
the
mercy
of
the
local
traders
who
took
their
pay
in
fish
for
the
bare
necessities
of
living
with
a
large
account
always
on
the
trader
side
with
such
medical
aid
and
ministration
as
came
only
occasionally
by
the
infrequent
mail
boat
and
not
at
all
in
the
long
winter
months
when
the
coast
was
firm
beset
with
ice
to
such
a
place
came
grenfell
in
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
its
inhabitants
to
live
there
so
long
as
he
should
to
die
there
were
it
god
will
as
it
stands
the
mission
to
deep
sea
fishermen
which
grenfell
represents
administers
and
animates
on
the
labrador
coast
not
only
brings
hope
new
courage
and
spiritual
comfort
to
an
isolated
people
in
a
desolate
land
but
cares
for
the
sick
and
injured

its
four
hospitals
and

by
means
of
journeys
covering
hundreds
of
miles
in

wholesome
and

living
conducts
coöperative

provides
for
orphans
and
for
families
bereft
of
the

accidents
of
the

encourages
thrift
and
administers
justice
and
adds
to
the
capacity
and
therefore
power
by
operating
a
sawmill
a
yard
and
other
productive
industries
to
accomplish
this
to
make
of
the
scattered
settlements
a
united
and
independent
people
to
safeguard
their
future
by
such
measures
as
the
establishment
of
a
seamen
institute
at
john
newfoundland
and
the
insurance
of
communication
with
the
outside
world
and
to
raise
by
personal
solicitation
the
money
needed
for
these
enterprises
requires
an
unusual
personality
faith
courage
insight
foresight
the
power
to
win
and
the
ability
to
command
all
of
these
and
more
of
like
qualities
are
embodied
and
portrayed
in

adrift
on
an
it
was
easter
sunday
at
anthony
in
the
year
but
with
us
in
northern
newfoundland
still
winter
everything
was
covered
with
snow
and
ice
i
was
walking
back
after
morning
service
when
a
boy
came
running
over
from
the
hospital
with
the
news
that
a
large
team
of
dogs
had
come
from
sixty
miles
to
the
southward
to
get
a
doctor
on
a
very
urgent
case
it
was
that
of
a
young
man
on
whom
we
had
operated
about
a
fortnight
before
for
an
acute
bone
disease
in
the
thigh
the
people
had
allowed
the
wound
to
close
the
poisoned
matter
had
accumulated
and
we
thought
we
should
have
to
remove
the
leg
there
was
obviously
therefore
no
time
to
be
lost
so
having
packed
up
the
necessary
instruments
dressings
and
drugs
and
having
fitted
out
the
with
my
best
dogs
i
started
at
once
the
messengers
following
me
with
their
team
my
team
was
an
especially
good
one
on
many
a
long
journey
they
had
stood
by
me
and
pulled
me
out
of
difficulties
by
their
sagacity
and
endurance
to
a
lover
of
his
dogs
as
every
christian
man
must
be
each
one
had
become
almost
as
precious

with

to

illustration
the
settlement
at
anthony
it
was
late
in
april
when
there
is
always
the
risk
of
getting
wet
through
the
ice
so
that
i
was
carefully
prepared
with
spare
outfit
which
included
a
change
of
garments
rifle
compass
axe
and
oilskin
overclothes
the
messengers
were
anxious
that
their
team
should
travel
back
with
mine
for
they
were
slow
at
best
and
needed
a
lead
my
dogs
however
being
a
powerful
team
could
not
be
held
back
and
though
i
managed
to
wait
twice
for
their
sleigh
i
had
reached
a
village
about
twenty
miles
on
the
journey
before
nightfall
and
had
fed
the
dogs
and
was
gathering
a
few
people
for
prayers
when
they
caught
me
up
during
the
night
the
wind
shifted
to
the
northeast
which
brought
in
fog
and
rain
softened
the
snow
and
made
travelling
very
bad
besides
heaving
a
heavy
sea
into
the
bay
our
drive
next
morning
would
be
somewhat
over
forty
miles
the
first
ten
miles
on
an
arm
of
the
sea
on
ice
illustration
on
a
journey
in
order
not
to
be
separated
too
long
from
my
friends
i
sent
them
ahead
two
hours
before
me
appointing
a
rendezvous
in
a
log
tilt
that
we
have
built
in
the
woods
as
a
halfway
house
there
is
no
one
living
on
all
that
long
and
to
provide
against
accidents
which
have
happened
more
than
once
we
built
this
hut
to
keep
dry
clothing
food
and
drugs
in
the
first
rain
of
the
year
was
falling
when
i
started
and
i
was
obliged
to
keep
on
what
we
call
the
ballicaters
or
ice
barricades
much
farther
up
the
bay
than
i
had
expected
the
sea
of
the
night
before
had
smashed
the
ponderous
covering
of
ice
right
to
the
landwash
there
were
great
gaping
chasms
between
the
enormous
blocks
which
we
call
pans
and
half
a
mile
out
it
was
all
clear
water
an
island
three
miles
out
had
preserved
a
bridge
of
ice
however
and
by
crossing
a
few
cracks
i
managed
to
reach
it
from
the
island
it
was
four
miles
across
to
a
rocky
promontory
a
course
that
would
be
several
miles
shorter
than
going
round
the
shore
here
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
ice
seemed
good
though
it
was
very
rough
obviously
it
had
been
smashed
up
by
the
sea
and
then
packed
in
again
by
the
strong
wind
from
the
northeast
and
i
thought
it
had
frozen
together
solid
all
went
well
till
i
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
then
the
wind
suddenly
fell
and
i
noticed
that
i
was
travelling
over
loose
sish
which
was
like
porridge
and
probably
many
feet
deep
by
stabbing
down
i
could
drive
my
through
the
thin
coating
of
young
ice
that
was
floating
on
it
the
sish
ice
consists
of
the
tiny
fragments
where
the
large
pans
have
been
pounding
together
on
the
heaving
sea
like
the
stones
of
freya
grinding
mill
so
quickly
did
the
wind
now
come
off
shore
and
so
quickly
did
the
packed
slob
relieved
of
the
wind
pressure
run
abroad
that
already
i
could
not
see
one
pan
larger
than
ten
feet
square
moreover
the
ice
was
loosening
so
rapidly
that
i
saw
that
retreat
was
absolutely
impossible
neither
was
there
any
way
to
get
off
the
little
pan
i
was
surveying
from
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
i
tore
off
my
oilskins
threw
myself
on
my
hands
and
knees
by
the
side
of
the
komatik
to
give
a
larger
base
to
hold
and
shouted
to
my
team
to
go
ahead
for
the
shore
before
we
had
gone
twenty
yards
the
dogs
got
frightened
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
the
komatik
instantly
sank
into
the
slob
it
was
necessary
then
for
the
dogs
to
pull
much
harder
so
that
they
now
began
to
sink
in
also
earlier
in
the
season
the
father
of
the
very
boy
i
was
going
to
operate
on
had
been
drowned
in
this
same
way
his
dogs
tangling
their
traces
around
him
in
the
slob
this
flashed
into
my
mind
and
i
managed
to
loosen
my
scramble
forward
find
the
traces
in
the
water
and
cut
them
holding
on
to
the
leader
trace
wound
round
my
wrist
illustration
travelling
on
broken
ice
being
in
the
water
i
could
see
no
piece
of
ice
that
would
bear
anything
up
but
there
was
as
it
happened
a
piece
of
snow
frozen
together
like
a
large
snowball
about
yards
away
near
where
my
leading
dog
brin
was
wallowing
in
the
slob
upon
this
he
very
shortly
climbed
his
long
trace
of
ten
fathoms
almost
reaching
there
before
he
went
into
the
water
this
dog
has
weird
black
markings
on
his
face
giving
him
the
appearance
of
wearing
a
perpetual
grin
after
climbing
out
on
the
snow
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
position
in
the
world
he
deliberately
shook
the
ice
and
water
from
his
long
coat
and
then
turned
round
to
look
for
me
as
he
sat
perched
up
there
out
of
the
water
he
seemed
to
be
grinning
with
satisfaction
the
other
dogs
were
hopelessly
bogged
indeed
we
were
like
flies
in
treacle
gradually
i
hauled
myself
along
the
line
that
was
still
tied
to
my
wrist
till
without
any
warning
the
dog
turned
round
and
slipped
out
of
his
harness
and
then
once
more
turned
his
grinning
face
to
where
i
was
struggling
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
progress
through
the
sish
ice
by
swimming
so
i
lay
there
and
thought
all
would
soon
be
over
only
wondering
if
any
one
would
ever
know
how
it
happened
there
was
no
particular
horror
attached
to
it
and
in
fact
i
began
to
feel
drowsy
as
if
i
could
easily
go
to
sleep
when
suddenly
i
saw
the
trace
of
another
big
dog
that
had
himself
gone
through
before
he
reached
the
pan
and
though
he
was
close
to
it
was
quite
unable
to
force
his
way
out
along
this
i
hauled
myself
using
him
as
a
bow
anchor
but
much
bothered
by
the
other
dogs
as
i
passed
them
one
of
which
got
on
my
shoulder
pushing
me
farther
down
into
the
ice
there
was
only
a
yard
or
so
more
when
i
had
passed
my
living
anchor
and
soon
i
lay
with
my
dogs
around
me
on
the
little
piece
of
slob
ice
i
had
to
help
them
on
to
it
working
them
through
the
lane
that
i
had
made
illustration
part
of
grenfell
team
the
piece
of
ice
we
were
on
was
so
small
it
was
obvious
we
must
soon
all
be
drowned
if
we
remained
upon
it
as
it
drifted
seaward
into
more
open
water
if
we
were
to
save
our
lives
no
time
was
to
be
lost
when
i
stood
up
i
could
see
about
twenty
yards
away
a
larger
pan
floating
amidst
the
sish
like
a
great
flat
raft
and
if
we
could
get
on
to
it
we
should
postpone
at
least
for
a
time
the
death
that
already
seemed
almost
inevitable
it
was
impossible
to
reach
it
without
a
life
line
as
i
had
already
learned
to
my
cost
and
the
next
problem
was
how
to
get
one
there
marvellous
to
relate
when
i
had
first
fallen
through
after
i
had
cut
the
dogs
adrift
without
any
hope
left
of
saving
myself
i
had
not
let
my
knife
sink
but
had
fastened
it
by
two
half
hitches
to
the
back
of
one
of
the
dogs
to
my
great
joy
there
it
was
still
and
shortly
i
was
at
work
cutting
all
the
sealskin
traces
still
hanging
from
the
dogs
harnesses
and
splicing
them
together
into
one
long
line
these
i
divided
and
fastened
to
the
backs
of
my
two
leaders
tying
the
near
ends
round
my
two
wrists
i
then
pointed
out
to
brin
the
pan
i
wanted
to
reach
and
tried
my
best
to
make
them
go
ahead
giving
them
the
full
length
of
my
lines
from
two
coils
my
long
sealskin
moccasins
reaching
to
my
thigh
were
full
of
ice
and
water
these
i
took
off
and
tied
separately
on
the
dogs
backs
my
coat
hat
gloves
and
overalls
i
had
already
lost
at
first
nothing
would
induce
the
two
dogs
to
move
and
though
i
threw
them
off
the
pan
two
or
three
times
they
struggled
back
upon
it
which
perhaps
was
only
natural
because
as
soon
as
they
fell
through
they
could
see
nowhere
else
to
make
for
to
me
however
this
seemed
to
spell
the
end
fortunately
i
had
with
me
a
small
black
spaniel
almost
a
featherweight
with
large
furry
paws
called
jack
who
acts
as
my
mascot
and
incidentally
as
my
retriever
this
at
once
flashed
into
my
mind
and
i
felt
i
had
still
one
more
chance
for
life
so
i
spoke
to
him
and
showed
him
the
direction
and
then
threw
a
piece
of
ice
toward
the
desired
goal
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
made
a
dash
for
it
and
to
my
great
joy
got
there
safely
the
tough
scale
of
sea
ice
carrying
his
weight
bravely
at
once
i
shouted
to
him
to
lie
down
and
this
too
he
immediately
did
looking
like
a
little
black
fuzz
ball
on
the
white
setting
my
leaders
could
now
see
him
seated
there
on
the
new
piece
of
floe
and
when
once
more
i
threw
them
off
they
understood
what
i
wanted
and
fought
their
way
to
where
they
saw
the
spaniel
carrying
with
them
the
line
that
gave
me
the
one
chance
for
my
life
the
other
dogs
followed
them
and
after
painful
struggling
all
got
out
again
except
one
taking
all
the
run
that
i
could
get
on
my
little
pan
i
made
a
dive
slithering
with
the
impetus
along
the
surface
till
once
more
i
sank
through
after
a
long
fight
however
i
was
able
to
haul
myself
by
the
long
traces
on
to
this
new
pan
having
taken
care
beforehand
to
tie
the
harnesses
to
which
i
was
holding
under
the
dogs
bellies
so
that
they
could
not
slip
them
off
but
alas
the
pan
i
was
now
on
was
not
large
enough
to
bear
us
and
was
already
beginning
to
sink
so
this
process
had
to
be
repeated
immediately
i
now
realized
that
though
we
had
been
working
toward
the
shore
we
had
been
losing
ground
all
the
time
for
the
wind
had
already
driven
us
a
hundred
yards
farther
out
but
the
widening
gap
kept
full
of
the
pounded
ice
through
which
no
man
could
possibly
go
i
had
decided
i
would
rather
stake
my
chances
on
a
long
swim
even
than
perish
by
inches
on
the
floe
as
there
was
no
likelihood
whatever
of
being
seen
and
rescued
but
keenly
though
i
watched
not
a
streak
even
of
clear
water
appeared
the
interminable
sish
rising
from
below
and
filling
every
gap
as
it
appeared
we
were
now
resting
on
a
piece
of
ice
about
ten
by
twelve
feet
which
as
i
found
when
i
came
to
examine
it
was
not
ice
at
all
but
simply
slob
frozen
into
a
mass
and
i
feared
it
would
very
soon
break
up
in
the
general
turmoil
of
the
heavy
sea
which
was
increasing
as
the
ice
drove
off
shore
before
the
wind
at
first
we
drifted
in
the
direction
of
a
rocky
point
on
which
a
heavy
surf
was
breaking
here
i
thought
once
again
to
swim
ashore
but
suddenly
we
struck
a
rock
a
large
piece
broke
off
the
already
small
pan
and
what
was
left
swung
round
in
the
backwash
and
started
right
out
to
sea
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
hope
for
a
rescue
alas
there
was
little
possibility
of
being
seen
as
i
have
already
mentioned
no
one
lives
around
this
big
bay
my
only
hope
was
that
the
other
komatik
knowing
i
was
alone
and
had
failed
to
keep
my
tryst
would
perhaps
come
back
to
look
for
me
this
however
as
it
proved
they
did
not
do
the
westerly
wind
was
rising
all
the
time
our
coldest
wind
at
this
time
of
the
year
coming
as
it
does
over
the
gulf
ice
it
was
tantalizing
as
i
stood
with
next
to
nothing
on
the
wind
going
through
me
and
every
stitch
soaked
in
to
see
my
komatik
some
fifty
yards
away
it
was
still
above
water
with
food
hot
tea
in
a
thermos
bottle
dry
clothing
matches
wood
and
everything
on
it
for
making
a
fire
to
attract
attention
it
is
easy
to
see
a
dark
object
on
the
ice
in
the
daytime
for
the
gorgeous
whiteness
shows
off
the
least
thing
but
the
tops
of
bushes
and
large
pieces
of
kelp
have
often
deceived
those
looking
out
moreover
within
our
memory
no
man
has
been
thus
adrift
on
the
bay
ice
the
chances
were
about
one
in
a
thousand
that
i
should
be
seen
at
all
and
if
i
were
seen
i
should
probably
be
mistaken
for
some
piece
of
refuse
to
keep
from
freezing
i
cut
off
my
long
moccasins
down
to
the
feet
strung
out
some
line
split
the
legs
and
made
a
kind
of
jacket
which
protected
my
back
from
the
wind
down
as
far
as
the
waist
i
have
this
jacket
still
and
my
friends
assure
me
it
would
make
a
good
sunday
garment
i
had
not
drifted
more
than
half
a
mile
before
i
saw
my
poor
komatik
disappear
through
the
ice
which
was
every
minute
loosening
up
into
the
small
pans
that
it
consisted
of
and
it
seemed
like
a
friend
gone
and
one
more
tie
with
home
and
safety
lost
to
the
northward
about
a
mile
distant
lay
the
mainland
along
which
i
had
passed
so
merrily
in
the
morning
only
it
seemed
a
few
moments
before
by
i
had
passed
the
island
to
which
i
had
crossed
on
the
ice
bridge
i
could
see
that
the
bridge
was
gone
now
if
i
could
reach
the
island
i
should
only
be
marooned
and
destined
to
die
of
starvation
but
there
was
little
chance
of
that
for
i
was
rapidly
driving
into
the
ever
widening
bay
illustration
grenfell
and
jack
with
the
jacket
made
from
moccasins
it
was
scarcely
safe
to
move
on
my
small
ice
raft
for
fear
of
breaking
it
yet
i
saw
i
must
have
the
skins
of
some
of
my
dogs
of
which
i
had
eight
on
the
pan
if
i
was
to
live
the
night
out
there
was
now
some
three
to
five
miles
between
me
and
the
north
side
of
the
bay
there
immense
pans
of
arctic
ice
surging
to
and
fro
on
the
heavy
ground
seas
were
thundering
into
the
cliffs
like
medieval
it
was
evident
that
even
if
seen
i
could
hope
for
no
help
from
that
quarter
before
night
no
boat
could
live
through
the
surf
unwinding
the
sealskin
traces
from
my
waist
round
which
i
had
wound
them
to
keep
the
dogs
from
eating
them
i
made
a
passed
it
over
the
first
dog
head
tied
it
round
my
foot
close
to
his
neck
threw
him
on
his
back
and
stabbed
him
in
the
heart
poor
beast
i
loved
him
like
a
friend
a
beautiful
dog
but
we
could
not
all
hope
to
live
in
fact
i
had
no
hope
any
of
us
would
at
that
time
but
it
seemed
better
to
die
fighting
in
spite
of
my
care
the
struggling
dog
bit
me
rather
badly
in
the
leg
i
suppose
my
numb
hands
prevented
my
holding
his
throat
as
i
could
ordinarily
do
moreover
i
must
hold
the
knife
in
the
wound
to
the
end
as
blood
on
the
fur
would
freeze
solid
and
make
the
skin
useless
in
this
way
i
sacrificed
two
more
large
dogs
receiving
only
one
more
bite
though
i
fully
expected
that
the
pan
i
was
on
would
break
up
in
the
struggle
the
other
dogs
who
were
licking
their
coats
and
trying
to
get
dry
apparently
took
no
notice
of
the
fate
of
their
comrades
but
i
was
very
careful
to
prevent
the
dying
dogs
crying
out
for
the
noise
of
fighting
would
probably
have
been
followed
by
the
rest
attacking
the
down
dog
and
that
was
too
close
to
me
to
be
pleasant
a
short
shrift
seemed
to
me
better
than
a
long
one
and
i
envied
the
dead
dogs
whose
troubles
were
over
so
quickly
indeed
i
came
to
balance
in
my
mind
whether
if
once
i
passed
into
the
open
sea
it
would
not
be
better
by
far
to
use
my
faithful
knife
on
myself
than
to
die
by
inches
there
seemed
no
hardship
in
the
thought
i
seemed
fully
to
sympathize
with
the
japanese
view
of
working
however
saved
me
from
philosophizing
by
the
time
i
had
skinned
these
dogs
and
with
my
knife
and
some
of
the
harness
had
strung
the
skins
together
i
was
ten
miles
on
my
way
and
it
was
getting
dark
away
to
the
northward
i
could
see
a
single
light
in
the
little
village
where
i
had
slept
the
night
before
where
i
had
received
the
kindly
hospitality
of
the
simple
fishermen
in
whose
comfortable
homes
i
have
spent
many
a
night
i
could
not
help
but
think
of
them
sitting
down
to
tea
with
no
idea
that
there
was
any
one
watching
them
for
i
had
told
them
not
to
expect
me
back
for
three
days
meanwhile
i
had
frayed
out
a
small
piece
of
rope
into
oakum
and
mixed
it
with
fat
from
the
intestines
of
my
dogs
alas
my
which
was
always
chained
to
me
had
leaked
and
my
matches
were
in
pulp
had
i
been
able
to
make
a
light
it
would
have
looked
so
unearthly
out
there
on
the
sea
that
i
felt
sure
they
would
see
me
but
that
chance
was
now
cut
off
however
i
kept
the
matches
hoping
that
i
might
dry
them
if
i
lived
through
the
night
while
working
at
the
dogs
about
every
five
minutes
i
would
stand
up
and
wave
my
hands
toward
the
land
i
had
no
flag
and
i
could
not
spare
my
shirt
for
wet
as
it
was
it
was
better
than
nothing
in
that
freezing
wind
and
anyhow
it
was
already
nearly
dark
unfortunately
the
coves
in
among
the
cliffs
are
so
placed
that
only
for
a
very
narrow
space
can
the
people
in
any
house
see
the
sea
indeed
most
of
them
can
not
see
it
at
all
so
that
i
could
not
in
the
least
expect
any
one
to
see
me
even
supposing
it
had
been
daylight
not
daring
to
take
any
snow
from
the
surface
of
my
pan
to
break
the
wind
with
i
piled
up
the
carcasses
of
my
dogs
with
my
skin
rug
i
could
now
sit
down
without
getting
soaked
during
these
hours
i
had
continually
taken
off
all
my
clothes
wrung
them
out
swung
them
one
by
one
in
the
wind
and
put
on
first
one
and
then
the
other
inside
hoping
that
what
heat
there
was
in
my
body
would
thus
serve
to
dry
them
in
this
i
had
been
fairly
successful
my
feet
gave
me
most
trouble
for
they
immediately
got
wet
again
because
my
thin
moccasins
were
easily
soaked
through
on
the
snow
i
suddenly
thought
of
the
way
in
which
the
lapps
who
tend
our
reindeer
manage
for
dry
socks
they
carry
grass
with
them
which
they
ravel
up
and
pad
into
their
shoes
into
this
they
put
their
feet
and
then
pack
the
rest
with
more
grass
tying
up
the
top
with
a
binder
the
ropes
of
the
harness
for
our
dogs
are
carefully
sewed
all
over
with
two
layers
of
flannel
in
order
to
make
them
soft
against
the
dogs
sides
so
as
soon
as
i
could
sit
down
i
started
with
my
trusty
knife
to
rip
up
the
flannel
though
my
fingers
were
more
or
less
frozen
i
was
able
also
to
ravel
out
the
rope
put
it
into
my
shoes
and
use
my
wet
socks
inside
my
knickerbockers
where
though
damp
they
served
to
break
the
wind
then
tying
the
narrow
strips
of
flannel
together
i
bound
up
the
top
of
the
moccasins
and
carried
the
bandage
on
up
over
my
knee
making
a
ragged
though
most
excellent
puttee
as
to
the
garments
i
wore
i
had
opened
recently
a
box
of
football
clothes
i
had
not
seen
for
twenty
years
i
had
found
my
old
oxford
university
football
running
shorts
and
a
pair
of
richmond
football
club
red
yellow
and
black
stockings
exactly
as
i
wore
them
twenty
years
ago
these
with
a
flannel
shirt
and
sweater
vest
were
now
all
i
had
left
coat
hat
gloves
oilskins
everything
else
were
gone
and
i
stood
there
in
that
odd
costume
exactly
as
i
stood
twenty
years
ago
on
a
football
field
reminding
me
of
the
little
girl
of
a
friend
who
when
told
she
was
dying
asked
to
be
dressed
in
her
sunday
frock
to
go
to
heaven
in
my
costume
being
very
light
dried
all
the
quicker
until
afternoon
then
nothing
would
dry
anymore
everything
freezing
stiff
it
had
been
an
ideal
costume
to
struggle
through
the
slob
ice
i
really
believe
the
conventional
garments
missionaries
are
supposed
to
affect
would
have
been
fatal
my
occupation
till
what
seemed
like
midnight
was
unravelling
rope
and
with
this
i
padded
out
my
knickers
inside
and
my
shirt
as
well
though
it
was
a
clumsy
job
for
i
could
not
see
what
i
was
doing
now
getting
my
largest
dog
doc
as
big
as
a
wolf
and
weighing
pounds
i
made
him
lie
down
so
that
i
could
cuddle
round
him
i
then
wrapped
the
three
skins
around
me
arranging
them
so
that
i
could
lie
on
one
edge
while
the
other
came
just
over
my
shoulders
and
head
my
own
breath
collecting
inside
the
newly
flayed
skin
must
have
had
a
soporific
effect
for
i
was
soon
fast
asleep
one
hand
i
had
kept
warm
against
the
curled
up
dog
but
the
other
being
gloveless
had
frozen
and
i
suddenly
awoke
shivering
enough
i
thought
to
break
my
fragile
pan
what
i
took
at
first
to
be
the
sun
was
just
rising
but
i
soon
found
it
was
the
moon
and
then
i
knew
it
was
about
twelve
the
dog
was
having
an
excellent
time
he
had
been
cuddled
so
warm
all
winter
and
he
resented
my
moving
with
low
growls
till
he
found
it
was
another
dog
illustration
doc
the
wind
was
steadily
driving
me
now
toward
the
open
sea
and
i
could
expect
short
of
a
miracle
nothing
but
death
out
there
somehow
one
scarcely
felt
justified
in
praying
for
a
miracle
but
we
have
learned
down
here
to
pray
for
things
we
want
and
anyhow
just
at
that
moment
the
miracle
occurred
the
wind
fell
off
suddenly
and
came
with
a
light
air
from
the
southward
and
then
dropped
stark
calm
the
ice
was
now
all
abroad
which
i
was
sorry
for
for
there
was
a
big
safe
pan
not
twenty
yards
away
from
me
if
i
could
have
got
on
that
i
might
have
killed
my
other
dogs
when
the
time
came
and
with
their
coats
i
could
hope
to
hold
out
for
two
or
three
days
more
and
with
the
food
and
drink
their
bodies
would
offer
me
need
not
at
least
die
of
hunger
or
thirst
to
tell
the
truth
they
were
so
big
and
strong
i
was
half
afraid
to
tackle
them
with
only
a
on
my
small
and
unstable
raft
but
it
was
now
freezing
hard
i
knew
the
calm
water
between
us
would
form
into
cakes
and
i
had
to
recognize
that
the
chance
of
getting
near
enough
to
escape
on
to
it
was
gone
if
on
the
other
hand
the
whole
bay
froze
solid
again
i
had
yet
another
possible
chance
for
my
pan
would
hold
together
longer
and
i
should
be
opposite
another
village
called
goose
cove
at
daylight
and
might
possibly
be
seen
from
there
i
knew
that
the
komatiks
there
would
be
starting
at
daybreak
over
the
hills
for
a
parade
of
orangemen
about
twenty
miles
away
possibly
therefore
i
might
be
seen
as
they
climbed
the
hills
so
i
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
again
it
seems
impossible
to
say
how
long
one
sleeps
but
i
woke
with
a
sudden
thought
in
my
mind
that
i
must
have
a
flag
but
again
i
had
no
pole
and
no
flag
however
i
set
to
work
in
the
dark
to
disarticulate
the
legs
of
my
dead
dogs
which
were
now
frozen
stiff
and
which
were
all
that
offered
a
chance
of
carrying
anything
like
a
distress
signal
cold
as
it
was
i
determined
to
sacrifice
my
shirt
for
that
purpose
with
the
first
streak
of
daylight
it
took
a
long
time
in
the
dark
to
get
the
legs
off
and
when
i
had
patiently
marled
them
together
with
old
harness
rope
and
the
remains
of
the
skin
traces
it
was
the
heaviest
and
crookedest
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
see
i
had
had
no
food
from
six
the
morning
before
when
i
had
eaten
porridge
and
bread
and
butter
i
had
however
a
rubber
band
which
i
had
been
wearing
instead
of
one
of
my
garters
and
i
chewed
that
for
hours
it
saved
me
from
thirst
and
hunger
oddly
enough
it
was
not
possible
to
get
a
drink
from
my
pan
for
it
was
far
too
salty
but
anyhow
that
thought
did
not
distress
me
much
for
as
from
time
to
time
i
heard
the
cracking
and
grinding
of
the
newly
formed
slob
it
seemed
that
my
devoted
boat
must
inevitably
soon
go
to
pieces
at
last
the
sun
rose
and
the
time
came
for
the
sacrifice
of
my
shirt
so
i
stripped
and
much
to
my
surprise
found
it
not
half
so
cold
as
i
had
anticipated
i
now
my
with
the
raw
side
out
so
that
they
made
a
kind
of
coat
quite
rivalling
joseph
but
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
the
frost
came
out
of
the
joints
of
my
legs
and
the
friction
caused
by
waving
it
made
my
almost
tie
itself
in
knots
still
i
could
raise
it
three
or
four
feet
above
my
head
which
was
very
important
now
however
i
found
that
instead
of
being
as
far
out
at
sea
as
i
had
reckoned
i
had
drifted
back
in
a
northwesterly
direction
and
was
off
some
cliffs
known
as
ireland
head
near
these
there
was
a
little
village
looking
seaward
whence
i
should
certainly
have
been
seen
but
as
i
had
myself
earlier
in
the
winter
been
at
this
place
i
had
learnt
there
was
not
a
single
soul
living
there
at
all
this
winter
the
people
had
all
as
usual
migrated
to
the
winter
houses
up
the
bay
where
they
get
together
for
schooling
and
social
purposes
i
soon
found
it
was
impossible
to
keep
waving
so
heavy
a
flag
all
the
time
and
yet
i
dared
not
sit
down
for
that
might
be
the
exact
moment
some
one
would
be
in
a
position
to
see
me
from
the
hills
the
only
thing
in
my
mind
was
how
long
i
could
stand
up
and
how
long
go
on
waving
that
pole
at
the
cliffs
once
or
twice
i
thought
i
saw
men
against
their
snowy
faces
which
i
judged
were
about
five
and
a
half
miles
from
me
but
they
were
only
trees
once
also
i
thought
i
saw
a
boat
approaching
a
glittering
object
kept
appearing
and
disappearing
on
the
water
but
it
was
only
a
small
piece
of
ice
sparkling
in
the
sun
as
it
rose
on
the
surface
i
think
that
the
rocking
of
my
cradle
up
and
down
on
the
waves
had
helped
me
to
sleep
for
i
felt
as
well
as
ever
i
did
in
my
life
and
with
the
hope
of
a
long
sunny
day
i
felt
sure
i
was
good
to
last
another
hours
if
my
boat
would
hold
out
and
not
rot
under
the
sun
rays
each
time
i
sat
down
to
rest
my
big
dog
doc
came
and
kissed
my
face
and
then
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
returning
again
to
where
i
was
huddled
up
as
if
to
say
why
do
you
come
along
surely
it
is
time
to
start
the
other
dogs
also
were
now
moving
about
very
restlessly
occasionally
trying
to
satisfy
their
hunger
by
gnawing
at
the
dead
bodies
of
their
brothers
i
determined
at
to
kill
a
big
eskimo
dog
and
drink
his
blood
as
i
had
read
only
a
few
days
before
in
farthest
north
of
nansen
doing
that
is
if
i
survived
the
battle
with
him
i
could
not
help
feeling
even
then
my
ludicrous
position
and
i
thought
if
ever
i
got
ashore
again
i
should
have
to
laugh
at
myself
standing
hour
after
hour
waving
my
shirt
at
those
lofty
cliffs
which
seemed
to
assume
a
kind
of
sardonic
grin
so
that
i
could
almost
imagine
they
were
laughing
at
me
at
times
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
good
breakfast
that
my
colleagues
were
enjoying
at
the
back
of
those
same
cliffs
and
of
the
snug
fire
and
the
comfortable
room
which
we
call
our
study
i
can
honestly
say
that
from
first
to
last
not
a
single
sensation
of
fear
entered
my
mind
even
when
i
was
struggling
in
the
slob
ice
somehow
it
did
not
seem
unnatural
i
had
been
through
the
ice
half
a
dozen
times
before
for
the
most
part
i
felt
very
sleepy
and
the
idea
was
then
very
strong
in
my
mind
that
i
should
soon
reach
the
solution
of
the
mysteries
that
i
had
been
preaching
about
for
so
many
years
only
the
previous
night
easter
sunday
at
prayers
in
the
cottage
we
had
been
discussing
the
fact
that
the
soul
was
entirely
separate
from
the
body
that
christ
idea
of
the
body
as
the
temple
in
which
the
soul
dwells
is
so
amply
borne
out
by
modern
science
we
had
talked
of
thoughts
from
that
admirable
book
brain
and
personality
by
thompson
of
new
york
and
also
of
the
same
subject
in
the
light
of
a
recent
operation
performed
at
the
johns
hopkins
hospital
by
harvey
cushing
the
doctor
had
removed
from
a
man
brain
two
large
cystic
tumors
without
giving
the
man
an
anæsthetic
and
the
patient
had
kept
up
a
running
conversation
with
him
all
the
while
the
doctor
fingers
were
working
in
his
brain
it
had
seemed
such
a
striking
proof
that
ourselves
and
our
bodies
are
two
absolutely
different
things
our
eternal
life
has
always
been
with
me
a
matter
of
faith
it
seems
to
me
one
of
those
problems
that
must
always
be
a
mystery
to
knowledge
but
my
own
faith
in
this
matter
had
been
so
untroubled
that
it
seemed
now
almost
natural
to
be
leaving
through
this
portal
of
death
from
an
ice
pan
in
many
ways
also
i
could
see
how
a
death
of
this
kind
might
be
of
value
to
the
particular
work
that
i
am
engaged
in
except
for
my
friends
i
had
nothing
i
could
think
of
to
regret
whatever
certainly
i
should
like
to
have
told
them
the
story
but
then
one
does
not
carry
folios
of
paper
in
running
shorts
which
have
no
pockets
and
all
my
writing
gear
had
gone
by
the
board
with
the
komatik
i
could
still
see
a
testimonial
to
myself
some
distance
away
in
my
khaki
overalls
which
i
had
left
on
another
pan
in
the
struggle
of
the
night
before
they
seemed
a
kind
of
company
and
would
possibly
be
picked
up
and
suggest
the
true
story
running
through
my
head
all
the
time
quite
unbidden
were
the
words
of
the
old
hymn
my
god
my
father
while
i
stray
far
from
my
home
on
life
dark
way
oh
teach
me
from
my
heart
to
say
thy
will
be
done
it
is
a
hymn
we
hardly
ever
sing
out
here
and
it
was
an
unconscious
memory
of
my
boyhood
days
it
was
a
perfect
morning
a
cobalt
sky
an
ultramarine
sea
a
golden
sun
an
almost
wasteful
extravagance
of
crimson
over
hills
of
purest
snow
which
caught
a
reflected
glow
from
rock
and
crag
between
me
and
the
hills
lay
miles
of
rough
ice
and
long
veins
of
thin
black
slob
that
had
formed
during
the
night
for
the
foreground
there
was
my
poor
gruesome
pan
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
edge
of
the
open
sea
stained
with
blood
and
littered
with
carcasses
and
débris
it
was
smaller
than
last
night
and
i
noticed
also
that
the
new
ice
from
the
water
melted
under
the
dogs
bodies
had
been
formed
at
the
expense
of
its
thickness
five
dogs
myself
in
colored
football
costume
and
a
bloody
dogskin
cloak
with
a
gay
flannel
shirt
on
a
pole
of
frozen
dogs
legs
completed
the
picture
the
sun
was
almost
hot
by
now
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
surplus
of
heat
in
my
skin
coat
i
began
to
look
longingly
at
one
of
my
remaining
dogs
for
an
appetite
will
rise
even
on
an
and
that
made
me
think
of
fire
so
once
again
i
inspected
my
matches
alas
the
heads
were
in
paste
all
but
three
or
four
wax
ones
these
i
now
laid
out
to
dry
while
i
searched
about
on
my
to
see
if
i
could
get
a
piece
of
transparent
ice
to
make
a
for
i
was
pretty
sure
that
with
all
the
unravelled
tow
i
had
stuffed
into
my
leggings
and
with
the
fat
of
my
dogs
i
could
make
smoke
enough
to
be
seen
if
only
i
could
get
a
light
i
had
found
a
piece
which
i
thought
would
do
and
had
gone
back
to
wave
my
flag
which
i
did
every
two
minutes
when
i
suddenly
thought
i
saw
again
the
glitter
of
an
oar
it
did
not
seem
possible
however
for
it
must
be
remembered
it
was
not
water
which
lay
between
me
and
the
land
but
slob
ice
which
a
mile
or
two
inside
me
was
very
heavy
even
if
people
had
seen
me
i
did
not
think
they
could
get
through
though
i
knew
that
the
whole
shore
would
then
be
trying
moreover
there
was
no
smoke
rising
on
the
land
to
give
me
hope
that
i
had
been
seen
there
had
been
no
in
the
night
and
i
felt
sure
that
had
any
one
seen
me
there
would
have
been
a
bonfire
on
every
hill
to
encourage
me
to
keep
going
so
i
gave
it
up
and
went
on
with
my
work
but
the
next
time
i
went
back
to
my
flag
the
glitter
seemed
very
distinct
and
though
it
kept
disappearing
as
it
rose
and
fell
on
the
surface
i
kept
my
eyes
strained
upon
it
for
my
dark
spectacles
had
been
lost
and
i
was
partly
snowblind
i
waved
my
flag
as
high
as
i
could
raise
it
broadside
on
at
last
beside
the
glint
of
the
white
oar
i
made
out
the
black
streak
of
the
hull
i
knew
that
if
the
pan
held
on
for
another
hour
i
should
be
all
right
with
that
strange
perversity
of
the
human
intellect
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
what
trophies
i
could
carry
with
my
luggage
from
the
pan
and
i
pictured
the
flagstaff
adorning
my
study
the
dogs
actually
ate
it
afterwards
i
thought
of
preserving
my
ragged
puttees
with
our
collection
of
curiosities
i
lost
no
time
now
at
the
my
whole
mind
was
devoted
to
making
sure
i
should
be
seen
and
i
moved
about
as
much
as
i
dared
on
the
raft
waving
my
sorry
token
aloft
at
last
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
the
boat
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
i
could
see
that
my
rescuers
were
frantically
waving
and
when
they
came
within
shouting
distance
i
heard
some
one
cry
out
do
get
excited
keep
on
the
pan
where
you
are
they
were
infinitely
more
excited
than
i
already
to
me
it
seemed
just
as
natural
now
to
be
saved
as
half
an
hour
before
it
had
seemed
inevitable
i
should
be
lost
and
had
my
rescuers
only
known
as
i
did
the
sensation
of
a
bath
in
that
ice
when
you
could
not
dry
yourself
afterwards
they
need
not
have
expected
me
to
follow
the
example
of
the
apostle
peter
and
throw
myself
into
the
water
as
the
man
in
the
bow
leaped
from
the
boat
on
to
my
ice
raft
and
grasped
both
my
hands
in
his
not
a
word
was
uttered
i
could
see
in
his
face
the
strong
emotions
he
was
trying
hard
to
force
back
though
in
spite
of
himself
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
it
was
the
same
with
each
of
the
others
of
my
rescuers
nor
was
there
any
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
them
these
were
not
the
emblems
of
weak
sentimentality
but
the
evidences
of
the
realization
of
the
deepest
and
noblest
emotion
of
which
the
human
heart
is
capable
the
vision
that
god
has
use
for
us
his
creatures
the
sense
of
that
supreme
joy
of
the
christ
the
joy
of
unselfish
service
after
the
and
swallowing
a
cup
of
warm
tea
that
had
been
thoughtfully
packed
in
a
bottle
we
hoisted
in
my
remaining
dogs
and
started
for
home
to
drive
the
boat
home
there
were
not
only
five
newfoundland
fishermen
at
the
oars
but
five
men
with
newfoundland
muscles
in
their
backs
and
five
as
brave
hearts
as
ever
beat
in
the
bodies
of
human
beings
so
slowly
but
steadily
we
forged
through
to
the
shore
now
jumping
out
on
to
larger
pans
and
forcing
them
apart
with
the
oars
now
hauling
the
boat
out
and
dragging
her
over
when
the
jam
of
ice
packed
tightly
in
by
the
rising
wind
was
impossible
to
get
through
otherwise
my
first
question
when
at
last
we
found
our
tongues
was
how
ever
did
you
happen
to
be
out
in
the
boat
in
this
ice
to
my
astonishment
they
told
me
that
the
previous
night
four
men
had
been
away
on
a
long
headland
cutting
out
some
dead
harp
seals
that
they
had
killed
in
the
fall
and
left
to
freeze
up
in
a
rough
wooden
store
they
had
built
there
and
that
as
they
were
leaving
for
home
my
pan
of
ice
had
drifted
out
clear
of
hare
island
and
one
of
them
with
his
keen
fisherman
eyes
had
seen
something
unusual
they
at
once
returned
to
their
village
saying
there
was
something
alive
drifting
out
to
sea
on
the
floe
ice
but
their
report
had
been
discredited
for
the
people
thought
that
it
could
be
only
the
top
of
some
tree
all
the
time
i
had
been
driving
along
i
knew
that
there
was
one
man
on
that
coast
who
had
a
good
he
tells
me
he
instantly
got
up
in
the
midst
of
his
supper
on
hearing
the
news
and
hurried
over
the
cliffs
to
the
lookout
carrying
his
trusty
with
him
immediately
dark
as
it
was
he
saw
that
without
any
doubt
there
was
a
man
out
on
the
ice
indeed
he
saw
me
wave
my
hands
every
now
and
again
towards
the
shore
by
a
very
easy
process
of
reasoning
on
so
uninhabited
a
shore
he
at
once
knew
who
it
was
though
some
of
the
men
argued
that
it
must
be
some
one
else
little
had
i
thought
as
night
was
closing
in
that
away
on
that
snowy
hilltop
lay
a
man
with
a
telescope
patiently
searching
those
miles
of
ice
for
hastily
they
rushed
back
to
the
village
and
at
once
went
down
to
try
to
launch
a
boat
but
that
proved
to
be
impossible
miles
of
ice
lay
between
them
and
me
the
heavy
sea
was
hurling
great
blocks
on
the
landwash
and
night
was
already
falling
the
wind
blowing
hard
on
shore
the
whole
village
was
aroused
and
messengers
were
despatched
at
once
along
the
coast
and
lookouts
told
off
to
all
the
favorable
points
so
that
while
i
considered
myself
a
bowing
with
my
flag
to
those
unresponsive
cliffs
there
were
really
many
eyes
watching
me
one
man
told
me
that
with
his
glass
he
distinctly
saw
me
waving
the
shirt
flag
there
was
little
slumber
that
night
in
the
villages
and
even
the
men
told
me
there
were
few
dry
eyes
as
they
thought
of
the
impossibility
of
saving
me
from
perishing
we
are
not
given
to
weeping
overmuch
on
this
shore
but
there
are
tears
that
do
a
man
honor
before
daybreak
this
fine
volunteer
crew
had
been
gotten
together
the
boat
with
such
a
force
behind
it
of
will
power
would
i
believe
have
gone
through
anything
and
after
seeing
the
heavy
breakers
through
which
we
were
guided
loaded
with
their
heavy
ice
when
at
last
we
ran
through
the
with
the
boat
on
our
return
i
knew
well
what
wives
and
children
had
been
thinking
of
when
they
saw
their
loved
ones
put
out
only
two
years
ago
i
remember
a
fisherman
wife
watching
her
husband
and
three
sons
take
out
a
boat
to
bring
in
a
stranger
that
was
showing
flags
for
a
pilot
but
the
boat
and
its
occupants
have
not
yet
come
back
every
soul
in
the
village
was
on
the
beach
as
we
neared
the
shore
every
soul
was
waiting
to
shake
hands
when
i
landed
even
with
the
grip
that
one
after
another
gave
me
some
no
longer
trying
to
keep
back
the
tears
i
did
not
find
out
my
hands
were
a
fact
i
have
not
been
slow
to
appreciate
since
however
i
must
have
been
a
weird
sight
as
i
stepped
ashore
tied
up
in
rags
stuffed
out
with
oakum
wrapped
in
the
bloody
skins
of
dogs
with
no
hat
coat
or
gloves
besides
and
only
a
pair
of
short
knickers
it
must
have
seemed
to
some
as
if
it
were
the
old
man
of
the
sea
coming
ashore
but
no
time
was
wasted
before
a
pot
of
tea
was
exactly
where
i
wanted
it
to
be
and
some
hot
stew
was
locating
itself
where
i
had
intended
an
hour
before
the
blood
of
one
of
my
remaining
dogs
should
have
gone
rigged
out
in
the
warm
garments
that
fishermen
wear
i
started
with
a
large
team
as
hard
as
i
could
race
for
the
hospital
for
i
had
learnt
that
the
news
had
gone
over
that
i
was
lost
it
was
soon
painfully
impressed
upon
me
that
i
could
not
much
enjoy
the
ride
for
i
had
to
be
hauled
like
a
log
up
the
hills
my
feet
being
so
that
i
could
not
walk
had
i
guessed
this
before
going
into
the
house
i
might
have
avoided
much
trouble
it
is
time
to
bring
this
egotistic
narrative
to
an
end
jack
lies
curled
up
by
my
feet
while
i
write
this
short
account
brin
is
once
again
leading
and
lording
it
over
his
fellows
doc
and
the
other
survivors
are
not
forgotten
now
that
we
have
again
returned
to
the
less
romantic
episodes
of
a
mission
hospital
life
there
stands
in
our
hallway
a
bronze
tablet
to
the
memory
of
three
noble
dogs
moody
watch
and
spy
whose
lives
were
given
for
mine
on
the
ice
in
my
home
in
england
my
brother
has
placed
a
duplicate
tablet
and
has
added
these
words
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
before
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
and
this
i
most
fully
believe
to
be
true
the
boy
whose
life
i
was
intent
on
saving
was
brought
to
the
hospital
a
day
or
two
later
in
a
boat
the
ice
having
cleared
off
the
coast
not
to
return
for
that
season
he
was
operated
on
successfully
and
is
even
now
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
we
all
love
life
i
was
glad
to
be
back
once
more
with
possibly
a
new
lease
of
it
before
me
i
had
learned
on
the
pan
many
things
but
chiefly
that
the
one
cause
for
regret
when
we
look
back
on
a
life
which
we
think
is
closed
forever
will
be
the
fact
that
we
have
wasted
its
opportunities
as
i
went
to
sleep
that
first
night
there
still
rang
in
my
ears
the
same
verse
of
the
old
hymn
which
had
been
my
companion
on
the
ice

appendix
one
of
grenfell
volunteer
helpers
miss
luther
of
providence
contributes
the
following
account
of
the
rescue
as
recited
in
the
newfoundland
vernacular
by
one
of
the
rescuing
party
one
day
about
a
week
after
grenfell
return
says
miss
luther
two
men
came
in
from
griquet
fifteen
miles
away
they
had
walked
all
that
distance
though
the
trail
was
heavy
with
soft
snow
and
they
often
sank
to
their
waists
and
waded
through
brooks
and
ponds
just
felt
we
must
see
the
doctor
and
tell
him
what
would
meant
to
us
if
he
been
lost
perhaps
nothing
but
the
doctor
own
tale
could
be
more
graphic
than
what
was
told
by
george
andrews
one
of
the
crew
who
rescued
him

rescuers
