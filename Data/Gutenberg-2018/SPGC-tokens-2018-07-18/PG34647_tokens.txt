great
island

of
those
islands

that
it
is
the
greatest
island

abendanon
has
given
me
permission
to
publish
this
english
version
which
is
a
selection
comprising
about
of
the
original
book
i
also
wish
to
acknowledge
my
debt
to
leonard
van
noppen
who
when
queen
wilhelmina
professor
of
dutch
literature
at
columbia
university
first
called
my
attention
to
the
book
and
told
me
something
of
the
letters
of
raden
adjeng
kartini
were
published
in
holland
they
aroused
much
interest
and
awakened
a
warm
sympathy
for
the
writer
she
was
the
young
daughter
of
a
javanese
regent
one
of
the
princesses
who
grow
up
and
blossom
in
sombre
obscurity
and
seclusion
leading
their
monotonous
and
often
melancholy
lives
within
the
confines
of
the
kaboepaten
as
the
high
walled
regent
palaces
are
thought
of
india
or
as
we
now
say
perhaps
more
happily
java
had
a
strange
fascination
for
me
even
as
a
child
i
was
charmed
by
the
weird
mystery
of
its
stories
which
frightened
even
while
they
charmed
me
although
i
was
born
in
holland
our
family
traditions
had
been
rooted
in
java
my
father
began
his
official
career
there
as
a
judge
and
my
mother
was
the
daughter
of
a
governor
general
while
my
older
brothers
had
followed
their
father
example
and
were
officials
under
the
colonial
nine
years
of
age
i
was
taken
to
the
inscrutable
and
far
off
land
round
which
my
early
fancy
had
played
and
i
passed
five
of
my
school
years
in
batavia
at
the
end
of
those
five
years
i
felt
the
same
charm
and
the
same
mystery
the
thought
of
java
became
almost
an
obsession
i
felt
that
while
we
netherlanders
might
rule
and
exploit
the
country
we
should
never
be
able
to
penetrate
its
mystery
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
always
be
covered
by
a
thick
veil
which
guarded
its
eastern
soul
from
the
strange
eyes
of
the
western
conqueror
there
was
a
quiet
strength
een
stille
kracht
unperceived
by
our
cold
gaze
it
was
something
intangible
and
almost
hostile
with
a
silent
secret
hostility
that
lurked
in
the
atmosphere
in
nature
and
above
all
in
the
soul
of
the
natives
it
menaced
from
the
slumbering
volcanoes
and
lay
hidden
in
the
mysterious
shadows
of
the
rustling
bamboos
it
was
in
the
bright
silver
moonlight
when
the
drooping
palm
trees
trembled
in
the
wind
until
they
seemed
to
play
a
symphony
so
gentle
and
so
complaining
that
it
moved
me
to
my
soul
i
do
not
know
whether
this
was
poetic
imagination
ever
prone
to
be
supersensitive
or
in
reality
the
quiet
strength
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
east
and
eternally
at
war
with
the
spirit
of
the
west
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
javanese
has
never
been
an
open
book
to
the
netherlander
the
difference
of
race
forms
an
abyss
so
deep
that
though
they
may
stand
face
to
face
and
look
into
each
other
eyes
it
is
as
though
they
saw
javanese
woman
of
noble
birth
is
even
more
impenetrable
the
life
of
a
raden
adjeng
or
a
raden
ajoe
is
a
thing
apart
even
the
dutch
officials
and
rulers
of
the
country
know
nothing
of
the
lives
of
these
secluded
princesses
as
we
like
to
call
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
regents
though
they
themselves
lay
no
claim
to
a
title
which
in
europe
ranks
so
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
depths
of
this
unknown
land
it
rose
from
behind
the
high
protecting
wall
that
had
done
its
work
of
subjection
and
concealment
through
the
ages
it
was
gentle
like
the
melodious
song
of
a
little
bird
in
a
cage
in
a
costly
cage
it
is
true
and
surrounded
by
the
tenderest
care
but
still
in
a
cage
that
was
also
a
prison
it
was
the
voice
of
raden
adjeng
kartini
which
sounded
above
the
walls
of
the
kaboepaten
it
was
like
the
cry
of
a
little
bird
that
wanted
to
spread
its
wings
free
in
the
air
and
fly
towards
life
and
the
sound
grew
fuller
and
clearer
till
it
became
the
rich
voice
of
a
was
shut
in
by
aristocratic
traditions
and
living
virtually
imprisoned
as
became
a
young
princess
of
java
but
she
sang
of
her
longing
for
life
and
work
and
her
voice
rose
clearer
and
stronger
it
penetrated
to
the
distant
netherlands
and
was
heard
there
with
wonder
and
with
delight
she
was
singing
a
new
song
the
first
complaint
that
had
ever
gone
forth
from
the
mysterious
hidden
life
of
the
javanese
woman
with
all
the
energy
of
her
body
and
soul
she
wanted
to
be
free
to
work
and
to
live
and
to
the
complaint
became
a
song
of
rejoicing
for
she
not
only
longed
to
lead
the
new
life
of
the
modern
woman
but
she
had
the
strength
to
accomplish
it
and
more
than
that
to
win
the
sympathy
of
her
family
and
of
her
friends
for
her
ideals
this
little
princess
lifted
the
concealing
veil
from
her
daily
life
and
not
only
her
life
her
thoughts
were
revealed
an
oriental
woman
had
dared
to
fight
for
feminism
even
against
her
tenderly
loved
parents
for
although
her
father
and
mother
were
enlightened
for
noble
javanese
they
had
at
first
strongly
opposed
her
ideas
as
unheard
of
wanted
to
study
and
later
to
become
a
teacher
to
open
a
school
for
the
daughters
of
regents
and
to
bring
the
new
spirit
into
their
lives
she
battled
bravely
she
would
not
give
up
in
the
end
she
adjeng
kartini
freed
herself
from
the
narrow
oppression
of
tradition
and
the
simple
language
of
these
letters
chants
a
paean
from
darkness
into
light
the
mist
of
obscurity
is
cleared
away
from
her
land
and
her
people
the
javanese
soul
is
shown
as
simple
gentle
and
less
hostile
than
we
westerners
had
ever
dared
to
hope
for
the
soul
of
this
girl
was
one
with
the
soul
of
her
people
and
it
is
through
her
that
a
new
confidence
has
grown
up
between
the
west
and
the
east
between
the
netherlands
and
java
the
mysterious
quiet
strength
is
brought
into
the
light
it
is
tender
human
and
full
of
love
and
holland
may
well
be
grateful
to
the
hand
that
revealed
noble
and
pure
soul
was
not
destined
to
remain
long
upon
earth
had
she
lived
who
knows
what
raden
adjeng
kartini
might
not
have
accomplished
for
the
well
being
of
her
country
and
her
people
above
all
for
the
javanese
woman
and
the
javanese
child
she
was
the
first
regent
daughter
to
break
the
fixed
tradition
in
regard
to
marriage
it
was
customary
to
give
the
bride
to
a
strange
bridegroom
whom
she
had
never
seen
perhaps
never
even
heard
of
until
her
wedding
day
kartini
chose
her
own
husband
a
man
whom
she
loved
but
her
happy
life
with
him
was
cut
short
by
her
early
is
sometimes
granted
to
those
whom
the
gods
love
to
bring
their
work
to
fruition
in
all
the
splendour
of
youth
in
the
springtime
or
the
summer
of
their
lives
to
have
worked
and
to
have
completed
a
great
task
when
one
is
young
so
that
the
world
is
left
richer
for
all
time
is
not
that
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
gifts
of
the
gods

under
which
kartini
letters
were
first
published
in
holland
introduction
these
letters
which
breathe
the
modern
spirit
in
all
of
its
restless
intensity
were
written
by
a
girl
of
the
orient
reared
in
an
ancient
and
outworn
civilization
they
unfold
the
story
of
the
writer
with
unconscious
simplicity
and
present
a
vivid
picture
of
javanese
life
and
manners
but
perhaps
their
chief
interest
lies
in
their
value
as
a
human
document
in
them
the
old
truth
of
the
oneness
of
humanity
is
once
more
made
manifest
and
we
see
that
the
magnificent
altruism
the
spirit
of
inquiry
and
the
almost
morbid
desire
for
and
analysis
that
characterize
the
opening
years
of
the
twentieth
century
were
not
peculiar
to
europe
or
to
america
but
were
universal
and
belonged
to
the
world
to
the
east
as
well
as
to
the
west
kartini
that
was
her
only
name
raden
adjeng
is
a
title
wrote
to
her
dutch
friends
in
the
language
of
the
netherlands
in
her
home
circle
she
spoke
always
javanese
and
she
was
javanese
in
her
intense
love
for
her
land
and
people
as
well
as
in
dress
and
manners
she
did
not
live
to
see
the
work
that
has
been
accomplished
in
her
name
during
the
last
ten
years
today
there
are
kartini
schools
in
all
parts
of
java
the
influence
of
her
life
and
teachings
is
perhaps
greater
than
that
of
any
other
woman
of
modern
times
because
it
reaches
all
of
the
millions
of
javanese
and
extends
to
some
extent
throughout
the
entire
east
she
did
not
desire
to
make
of
her
people
but
better
javanese
not
the
material
freedom
for
which
during
the
three
hundred
years
of
dutch
rule
the
javanese
of
the
past
had
sometimes
waged
a
bloody
warfare
but
the
greater
freedom
of
the
mind
and
of
the
spirit
the
dutch
rule
had
become
enlightened
in
local
affairs
the
javanese
had
under
their
own
officials
but
they
were
bowed
down
by
superstition
and
under
the
sway
of
tradition
the
adat
or
law
which
can
not
be
changed
was
fostered
by
religion
they
were
imbued
with
all
the
fatalism
of
the
mohammedan
the
future
belonged
to
tekdir
or
fate
and
it
was
vain
to
rebel
against
its
decrees
but
kartini
rebelled
against
tekdir
she
refused
to
believe
in
the
righteousness
of
the
ancient
law
that
a
girl
must
marry
or
breaking
that
law
bring
everlasting
disgrace
upon
her
family
she
realized
that
the
freedom
of
woman
could
only
come
through
economic
independence
and
personally
she
said
that
she
had
rather
be
a
kitchen
maid
than
be
forced
to
marry
a
strange
and
unknown
man
for
in
javanese
circles
girls
were
brought
up
according
to
the
most
rigid
mohammedan
canons
and
closely
guarded
from
the
eyes
of
men
abendanon
the
compiler
of
kartini
letters
says
that
although
he
had
lived
for
years
in
java
she
and
her
sisters
were
the
first
young
girls
of
noble
birth
that
he
had
ever
seen
kartini
wanted
to
go
to
holland
to
study
to
return
home
when
she
had
gained
a
broader
knowledge
and
experience
equipped
for
teaching
the
daughters
of
her
own
people
she
wished
to
help
them
through
education
to
break
with
the
stultifying
traditions
of
the
past
although
always
a
mohammedan
marriage
with
more
than
one
wife
was
abhorrent
to
her
true
progress
seemed
impossible
in
a
polygamous
society
for
men
or
for
women
furthermore
polygamy
was
not
commanded
or
even
approved
of
by
mohammed
himself
it
had
been
merely
permitted
after
years
of
conflict
between
her
affection
for
her
family
and
the
principles
in
which
she
believed
kartini
won
the
entire
confidence
both
of
her
father
and
of
her
mother
her
mother
was
an
exponent
of
the
best
ideals
of
oriental
womanhood
excelling
in
care
of
the
home
and
filled
with
love
and
sympathy
for
her
husband
and
children
kartini
was
an
innovator
who
sought
to
break
new
paths
for
her
people
but
in
reaching
out
for
the
new
and
untried
she
gained
rather
than
lost
in
respect
for
the
old
fashioned
virtues
of
her
kind
her
interests
were
human
and
not
merely
feministic
which
can
not
always
be
said
of
our
own
feminism
kartini
biography
is
brief
and
her
life
almost
uneventful
so
far
as
outward
happenings
go
she
was
born
on
the
of
april
the
daughter
of
raden
mas
adipati
sosroningrat
regent
of
japara
his
father
the
regent
of
demak
pangèran
ario
tjondronegoro
was
an
enlightened
man
who
had
given
european
educations
to
all
of
his
sons
and
who
is
described
by
his
kartini
as
the
first
regent
of
middle
java
to
unlatch
his
door
to
that
guest
from
over
the
sea
western
civilization
the
regent
of
japara
went
still
further
as
became
the
next
generation
he
sent
his
daughters
to
the
free
grammar
school
for
europeans
at
semarang
so
that
they
might
learn
dutch
kartini
best
friend
at
school
was
a
little
hollander
letsy
the
daughter
of
the
head
master
a
question
of
letsy
what
are
you
going
to
be
when
you
grow
up
both
puzzled
and
interested
her
when
she
went
home
after
school
was
over
she
repeated
the
question
anxiously
what
am
i
going
to
be
when
i
grow
up
her
father
who
loved
her
very
dearly
did
not
answer
but
smiled
and
pinched
her
cheek
an
older
brother
overheard
her
and
said
what
should
a
girl
become
why
a
raden
ajoe
of
course
raden
ajoe
is
the
title
of
a
javanese
married
woman
of
high
rank
while
the
unmarried
daughter
of
a
regent
is
raden
adjeng
in
kartini
a
spirit
of
rebellion
was
awakened
which
grew
with
the
years
even
as
a
child
she
vowed
that
she
would
not
become
merely
a
raden
ajoe
she
would
be
strong
combat
all
prejudice
and
shape
her
own
destiny
but
she
was
soon
to
feel
the
weight
of
convention
pressing
upon
her
with
inexorable
force
when
she
reached
the
age
of
twelve
and
a
half
she
was
considered
by
her
parents
old
enough
to
leave
school
and
remain
at
home
in
seclusion
according
to
the
established
usage
some
day
there
would
have
to
be
a
wedding
and
a
javanese
bridegroom
was
chosen
by
the
parents
and
often
never
seen
by
his
bride
until
after
the
ceremony
as
her
presence
was
not
required
at
that
solemnity
kartini
implored
her
father
on
her
knees
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
with
her
studies
but
he
felt
bound
by
the
hitherto
unbroken
conventions
of
his
race
and
she
went
into
the
box
as
it
was
called
passing
four
long
years
without
ever
once
going
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
kaboepaten
during
those
years
reading
was
her
greatest
pleasure
and
her
father
was
proud
of
her
intelligence
and
kept
her
supplied
with
dutch
books
she
did
not
always
understand
what
she
read
but
would
often
be
guided
through
the
difficult
places
by
her
father
or
by
her
favourite
brother
kartono
who
felt
a
warm
sympathy
for
his
sister
but
the
spirit
of
progress
slowly
awakened
even
in
slumbering
java
and
when
kartini
was
sixteen
she
was
released
from
her
imprisonment
her
first
journey
into
the
outside
world
was
to
accompany
her
parents
to
the
festivities
held
in
honour
of
the
coronation
of
queen
wilhelmina
this
caused
a
great
scandal
in
conservative
javanese
society
but
kartini
and
her
sisters
did
not
have
the
freedom
for
which
they
longed
they
could
not
go
out
into
the
world
and
fight
its
battles
they
could
only
take
well
chaperoned
little
excursions
and
meet
the
guests
both
men
and
women
of
their
father
household
they
were
free
very
much
as
a
delicately
nurtured
victorian
young
lady
would
have
been
free
half
a
century
ago
in
the
minister
of
education
and
industry
for
netherland
india
was
abendanon
he
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
and
progress
of
the
native
javanese
and
realized
the
need
of
schools
for
native
girls
at
that
time
there
was
none
in
java
he
had
heard
of
the
enlightened
regent
of
japara
and
of
the
example
which
he
had
set
to
his
fellow
countrymen
in
educating
his
own
daughters
accompanied
by
his
wife
abendanon
went
to
japara
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
the
regent
in
interesting
the
native
official
world
in
his
project
a
school
for
native
girls
had
been
the
dream
of
kartini
and
her
sisters
with
her
the
idea
had
become
almost
an
obsession
her
longing
for
education
had
gathered
force
and
widened
in
its
significance
it
no
longer
meant
the
shaping
of
an
independent
career
for
herself
but
a
means
to
an
end
of
work
among
her
people
abendanon
in
describing
the
first
meeting
with
kartini
said
that
when
she
and
her
sisters
came
forward
in
their
picturesque
native
costume
they
made
a
most
charming
impression
but
the
charm
was
heightened
when
they
spoke
to
him
in
fluent
dutch
kartini
said
that
a
girls
school
was
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
but
asked
that
it
also
be
a
vocational
school
fitting
the
girl
for
should
she
desire
it
the
influence
and
friendship
of
the
abendanons
became
a
great
comfort
and
support
to
kartini
mevrouw
abendanon
was
called
moedertje
little
mother
and
many
letters
were
written
to
her
kartini
was
never
able
to
go
to
holland
and
study
although
her
disappointment
was
intense
she
became
convinced
that
her
influence
among
her
own
people
would
be
stronger
if
she
remained
at
home
free
in
their
eyes
from
the
possibility
of
contamination
by
foreign
ideas
acting
upon
the
advice
of
mevrouw
abendanon
she
opened
a
school
at
home
for
little
girls
with
the
help
of
her
sisters
she
instructed
them
in
elementary
branches
in
sewing
and
in
cooking
at
last
she
obtained
the
permission
of
her
father
to
continue
her
own
studies
at
batavia
but
she
did
not
go
to
batavia
nor
did
she
leave
the
house
of
her
parents
in
the
way
that
she
had
planned
she
fell
in
love
like
any
western
girl
and
was
married
in
to
raden
adipati
djojo
adiningrat
regent
of
rembang
he
had
been
educated
in
holland
and
had
many
enlightened
ideas
for
the
advancement
of
his
people
the
dreams
of
kartini
were
as
his
own
she
had
his
full
sympathy
and
their
work
in
the
future
would
be
carried
on
together
both
of
them
were
interested
in
the
ancient
history
of
java
the
sagas
and
stories
of
the
past
they
wished
to
make
a
collection
of
these
they
also
felt
a
warm
interest
in
the
revival
of
javanese
art
in
wood
carving
textile
weaving
dyeing
work
in
gold
and
copper
and
tortoise
shell
after
kartini
was
married
her
little
school
was
continued
at
rembang
and
some
of
the
wood
carvers
who
had
been
working
under
her
supervision
at
semarang
were
anxious
to
follow
her
to
her
new
home
although
i
am
a
modern
woman
what
a
strange
bridal
dower
i
shall
have
she
writes
to
mevrouw
abendanon
in
discussing
the
plan
for
moving
the
little
children
she
was
teaching
and
the
wood
carvers
to
rembang
a
charming
picture
of
the
married
life
of
kartini
is
given
in
her
own
letters
there
was
a
year
of
hard
work
and
increased
responsibility
but
also
of
great
happiness
on
the
of
september
four
days
after
the
birth
of
her
son
siengghi
she
died
in
the
first

kartini
school
was
founded
at
batavia
its
inception
was
largely
due
to
the
efforts
of
abendanon
the
governor
general
of
the
queen
mother
of
holland
and
many
other
influential
persons
gave
it
their
active
support
a
society
at
the
hague
known
as
the
had
been
formed
and
under
its
patronage
there
are
now
schools
at
malang
cheribon
buitenzorg
soerabaja
semarang
and
soerakarta
as
well
as
at
batavia
there
is
also
a
large
number
of
native
kartini
schools
under
the
direct
management
of
native
javanese
the
long
slumber
of
java
has
ended
the
principles
for
which
kartini
suffered
and
struggled
are
now
almost
universally
accepted
by
her
fellow
countrymen
a
javanese
girl
even
though
of
noble
birth
may
now
earn
her
living
without
bringing
disgrace
upon
her
family
women
choose
their
own
husbands
and
plural
marriages
are
much
less
frequent
among
the
younger
generation
the
time
was
ripe
it
has
been
said
that
great
men
are
the
products
of
great
movements
there
must
always
be
some
one
to
strike
the
note
of
leadership
so
firmly
convinced
of
the
righteousness
of
a
given
cause
that
he
or
she
goes
blindly
forward
forgetful
of
personal
interest
and
of
all
selfish
considerations
combatting
the
world
if
need
be
holding
its
ridicule
as
of
no
account
and
what
is
perhaps
hardest
of
all
bringing
sorrow
and
disappointment
to
those
that
love
them
the
prophet
burned
at
the
stake
amid
execrations
and
the
conqueror
who
receives
the
plaudits
of
the
multitude
alike
await
the
judgment
of
posterity
only
in
after
years
can
we
weigh
the
thing
that
they
have
wrought
and
gauge
its
true
value
kartini
has
stood
the
test
of
time
to
the
modern
progressive
javanese
she
is
a
national
heroine
almost
a

her

i
may
i
have
longed
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
modern
girl
that
proud
independent
girl
who
has
all
my
sympathy
she
who
happy
and
lightly
and
alertly
steps
on
her
way
through
life
full
of
enthusiasm
and
warm
feeling
working
not

but
for
the
greater
good
of
humanity
as
a
whole
i
glow
with
enthusiasm
toward
the
new
time
which
has
come
and
can
truly
say
that
in
my
thoughts
and
sympathies
i
do
not
belong
to
the
indian
world
but
to
that
of
my
pale
sisters
who
are
struggling
forward
in
the
distant
west
if
the
laws
of
my
land
permitted
it
there
is
nothing
that
i
had
rather
do
than
give
myself
wholly
to
the
working
and
striving
of
the
new
woman
in
europe
but
traditions
that
can
not
be
broken
hold
us
fast
cloistered
in
their
unyielding
arms
some
day
those
arms
will
loosen
and
let
us
go
but
that
time
lies
as
yet
far
from
us
infinitely
far
it
will
come
that
i
know
it
may
be
three
four
generations
after
us
oh
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
love
this
young
this
new
age
with
heart
and
soul
and
yet
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
chained
by
all
the
laws
customs
and
conventions
of
one
land
all
our
institutions
are
directly
opposed
to
the
progress
for
which
i
so
long
for
the
sake
of
our
people
day
and
night
i
wonder
by
what
means
our
ancient
traditions
could
be
overcome
for
myself
i
could
find
a
way
to
shake
them
off
to
break
them
were
it
not
that
another
bond
stronger
than
any
tradition
could
ever
be
binds
me
to
my
world
and
that
is
the
love
which
i
bear
for
those
to
whom
i
owe
my
life
and
whom
i
must
thank
for
everything
have
i
the
right
to
break
the
hearts
of
those
who
have
given
me
nothing
but
love
and
kindness
my
whole
life
long
and
who
have
surrounded
me
with
the
tenderest
care
but
it
was
not
the
voices
alone
which
reached
me
from
that
distant
that
bright
that
europe
which
made
me
long
for
a
change
in
existing
conditions
even
in
my
childhood
the
word
emancipation
enchanted
my
ears
it
had
a
significance
that
nothing
else
had
a
meaning
that
was
far
beyond
my
comprehension
and
awakened
in
me
an
evergrowing
longing
for
freedom
and
independence
a
longing
to
stand
alone
conditions
both
in
my
own
surroundings
and
in
those
of
others
around
me
broke
my
heart
and
made
me
long
with
a
nameless
sorrow
for
the
awakening
of
my
country
then
the
voices
which
penetrated
from
distant
lands
grew
clearer
and
clearer
till
they
reached
me
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
some
who
loved
me
but
to
the
deep
grief
of
others
brought
seed
which
entered
my
heart
took
root
and
grew
strong
and
vigorous
and
now
i
must
tell
you
something
of
myself
so
that
you
can
make
my
acquaintance
i
am
the
eldest
of
the
three
unmarried
daughters
of
the
regent
of
japara
and
have
six
brothers
and
sisters
what
a
world
eh
my
grandfather
pangèran
ario
tjondronegoro
of
demak
was
a
great
leader
in
the
progressive
movement
of
his
day
and
the
first
regent
of
middle
java
to
unlatch
his
door
to
that
guest
from
over
the
sea
western
civilization
all
of
his
children
had
european
educations
all
of
them
have
or
had
several
of
them
are
now
dead
a
love
of
progress
inherited
from
their
father
and
these
gave
to
their
children
the
same
upbringing
which
they
themselves
had
received
many
of
my
cousins
and
all
my
older
brothers
have
gone
through
the
hoogere
burger
school
the
highest
institution
of
learning
that
we
have
here
in
india
and
the
youngest
of
my
three
older
brothers
has
been
studying
for
three
years
in
the
netherlands
and
two
others
are
in
the
service
of
that
country
we
girls
so
far
as
education
goes
fettered
by
our
ancient
traditions
and
conventions
have
profited
but
little
by
these
advantages
it
was
a
great
crime
against
the
customs
of
our
land
that
we
should
be
taught
at
all
and
especially
that
we
should
leave
the
house
every
day
to
go
to
school
for
the
custom
of
our
country
forbade
girls
in
the
strongest
manner
ever
to
go
outside
of
the
house
we
were
never
allowed
to
go
anywhere
however
save
to
the
school
and
the
only
place
of
instruction
of
which
our
city
could
boast
which
was
open
to
us
was
a
free
grammar
school
for
europeans
when
i
reached
the
age
of
twelve
i
was
kept
at
home
i
must
go
into
the
box
i
was
locked
up
and
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
outside
world
toward
which
i
might
never
turn
again
save
at
the
side
of
a
bridegroom
a
stranger
an
unknown
man
whom
my
parents
would
choose
for
me
and
to
whom
i
should
be
betrothed
without
my
own
knowledge
european
friends
this
i
heard
later
had
tried
in
every
possible
way
to
dissuade
my
parents
from
this
cruel
course
toward
me
a
young
and
child
but
they
were
able
to
do
nothing
my
parents
were
inexorable
i
went
into
my
prison
four
long
years
i
spent
between
thick
walls
without
once
seeing
the
outside
world
how
i
passed
through
that
time
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
it
was
terrible
but
there
was
one
great
happiness
left
me
the
reading
of
dutch
books
and
correspondence
with
dutch
friends
was
not
forbidden
this
the
only
gleam
of
light
in
that
empty
sombre
time
was
my
all
without
which
i
should
have
fallen
perhaps
into
a
still
more
pitiable
state
my
life
my
soul
even
would
have
been
starved
but
then
came
my
friend
and
my
deliverer
the
spirit
of
the
age
his
footsteps
echoed
everywhere
proud
solid
ancient
structures
tottered
to
their
foundation
at
his
approach
strongly
barricaded
doors
sprang
open
some
as
of
themselves
others
only
painfully
half
way
but
nevertheless
they
opened
and
let
in
the
unwelcome
guest
at
last
in
my
sixteenth
year
i
saw
the
outside
world
again
thank
god
thank
god
i
could
leave
my
prison
as
a
free
human
being
and
not
chained
to
an
unwelcome
bridegroom
then
events
followed
quickly
that
gave
back
to
us
girls
more
and
more
of
our
lost
freedom
in
the
following
year
at
the
time
of
the
investiture
of
our
young
princess
our
parents
presented
us
officially
with
our
freedom
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
we
were
allowed
to
leave
our
native
town
and
to
go
to
the
city
where
the
festivities
were
held
in
honour
of
the
occasion
what
a
great
and
priceless
victory
it
was
that
young
girls
of
our
position
should
show
themselves
in
public
was
here
an
occurrence
the
world
stood
aghast
tongues
were
set
wagging
at
the
unprecedented
crime
our
european
friends
rejoiced
and
as
for
ourselves
no
queen
was
so
rich
as
we
but
i
am
far
from
satisfied
i
would
go
still
further
always
further
i
do
not
desire
to
go
out
to
feasts
and
little
frivolous
amusements
that
has
never
been
the
cause
of
my
longing
for
freedom
i
long
to
be
free
to
be
able
to
stand
alone
to
study
not
to
be
subject
to
any
one
and
above
all
to
be
obliged
to
marry
but
we
marry
must
must
not
to
marry
is
the
greatest
sin
which
the
mohammedan
woman
can
commit
it
is
the
greatest
disgrace
which
a
native
girl
can
bring
to
her
family
and
marriage
among
us
miserable
is
too
feeble
an
expression
for
it
how
can
it
be
otherwise
when
the
laws
have
made
everything
for
the
man
and
nothing
for
the
woman
when
law
and
convention
both
are
for
the
man
when
everything
is
allowed
to
him
love
what
do
we
know
here
of
love
how
can
we
love
a
man
whom
we
have
never
known
and
how
could
he
love
us
that
in
itself
would
not
be
possible
young
girls
and
men
must
be
kept
rigidly
apart
and
are
never
allowed
to
meet
i
am
anxious
to
know
of
your
occupations
it
is
all
very
interesting
to
me
i
wish
to
know
about
your
studies
i
would
know
something
of
your
toynbee
evenings
and
of
the
society
for
total
abstinence
of
which
you
are
so
zealous
a
member
among
our
indian
people
we
have
not
the
drink
demon
to
fight
thank
god
but
i
fear
i
fear
that
when
once
forgive
me
your
western
civilization
shall
have
obtained
a
foothold
among
us
we
shall
have
that
evil
to
contend
with
too
civilization
is
a
blessing
but
it
has
its
dark
side
as
well
the
tendency
to
imitate
is
inborn
i
believe
the
masses
imitate
the
upper
classes
who
in
turn
imitate
those
of
higher
rank
and
these
again
follow
the
europeans
among
us
there
is
no
marriage
feast
without
drinking
and
at
the
festivals
of
the
natives
where
they
are
not
of
strong
religious
convictions
and
usually
they
are
mohammedans
only
because
their
fathers
grandfathers
and
remote
ancestors
were
mohammedans
in
reality
they
are
little
better
than
heathen
large
square
bottles
are
always
kept
standing
and
they
are
not
sparing
in
the
use
of
these
but
an
evil
greater
than
alcohol
is
here
and
that
is
opium
oh
the
misery
the
inexpressible
horror
it
has
brought
to
my
country
opium
is
the
pest
of
java
yes
opium
is
far
worse
than
the
pest
the
pest
does
not
remain
for
ever
sooner
or
later
it
goes
away
but
the
evil
of
opium
once
established
grows
it
spreads
more
and
more
and
will
never
leave
us
never
grow
less
for
to
speak
plainly
it
is
protected
by
the
government
the
more
general
the
use
of
opium
in
java
the
fuller
the
treasury
the
opium
tax
is
one
of
the
richest
sources
of
income
of
the
government
what
matter
if
it
go
well
or
ill
with
the
people
the
government
prospers
this
curse
of
the
people
fills
the
treasury
of
the
dutch
indian
government
with
thousands
nay
with
millions
many
say
that
the
use
of
opium
is
no
evil
but
those
who
say
that
have
never
known
india
or
else
they
are
blind
what
are
our
daily
murders
incendiary
fires
robberies
but
the
direct
result
of
the
use
of
opium
true
the
desire
for
opium
is
not
so
great
an
evil
as
long
as
one
can
get
it
when
one
has
money
to
buy
the
poison
but
when
one
can
not
obtain
it
when
one
has
no
money
with
which
to
buy
it
and
is
a
confirmed
user
of
it
then
one
is
dangerous
then
one
is
lost
hunger
will
make
a
man
a
thief
but
the
hunger
for
opium
will
make
him
a
murderer
there
is
a
saying
here
at
first
you
eat
opium
but
in
the
end
it
will
devour
you
it
is
terrible
to
see
so
much
evil
and
to
be
powerless
to
fight
against
it
that
splendid
book
by
mevrouw
goekoop
i
know
i
have
read
it
three
times
i
could
never
grow
tired
of
it
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
able
to
live
in
hilda
environment
oh
that
we
in
india
had
gone
so
far
that
a
book
could
cause
such
violent
controversy
among
us
as
hilda
van
suylenburg
has
in
your
country
i
shall
never
rest
till
appears
in
my
own
language
to
do
good
as
well
as
harm
to
our
indian
world
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
good
or
harm
if
it
but
makes
an
impression
for
that
shows
that
one
is
no
longer
sleeping
and
java
is
still
in
deep
slumber
and
how
will
her
people
ever
be
awakened
when
those
who
should
serve
as
examples
themselves
love
sleep
so
much
the
greater
number
of
european
women
in
india
care
little
or
nothing
for
the
work
of
their
sisters
in
the
fatherland
will
you
not
tell
me
something
of
the
labours
the
struggles
the
sentiments
of
the
woman
of
today
in
the
netherlands
we
take
deep
interest
in
all
that
concerns
the
woman
movement
i
do
not
know
the
modern
languages
alas
we
girls
are
not
allowed
by
our
law
to
learn
languages
it
was
a
great
innovation
for
us
to
learn
dutch
i
long
to
know
languages
not
so
much
to
be
able
to
speak
them
as
for
the
far
greater
joy
of
being
able
to
read
the
many
beautiful
works
of
foreign
authors
in
their
own
tongue
is
it
not
true
that
never
mind
how
good
a
translation
may
be
it
is
never
so
fine
as
the
original
that
is
always
stronger
more
charming
we
have
much
time
for
reading
and
reading
is
our
greatest
pleasure
we
that
is
the
younger
sisters
and
i
we
three
have
had
the
same
bringing
up
and
are
much
with
one
another
we
differ
in
age
each
from
the
other
but
one
year
among
us
three
there
is
the
greatest
harmony
naturally
we
sometimes
have
little
differences
of
opinion
but
that
does
not
weaken
the
tie
that
binds
us
together
our
little
quarrels
are
splendid
i
find
them
so
i
love
the
reconciliations
which
follow
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
lies
do
you
not
think
so
too
that
any
two
human
beings
can
think
alike
in
everything
that
can
not
be
people
who
say
that
must
be
hypocrites
i
have
not
yet
told
you
how
old
i
am
i
was
just
twenty
last
month
strange
that
when
i
was
sixteen
i
felt
so
frightfully
old
and
had
so
many
melancholy
moods
now
that
i
can
put
two
crosses
behind
me
i
feel
young
and
full
of
the
joy
of
life
and
the
struggle
of
life
too
call
me
simply
kartini
that
is
my
name
we
javanese
have
no
family
names
kartini
is
my
given
name
and
my
family
name
both
at
the
same
time
as
far
as
raden
adjeng
is
concerned
those
two
words
are
the
title
i
told
mevrouw
van
wermeskerken
when
i
gave
her
my
address
not
to
put
kartini
alone
that
would
hardly
reach
me
from
holland
and
as
for
writing
mejuffrouw
or
something
of
that
kind
i
have
no
right
to
it
i
am
only
a
javanese
now
for
the
present
you
know
enough
about
me
is
it
not
so
another
time
i
shall
tell
you
of
our
indian
life
if
there
is
any
light
that
you
would
like
thrown
upon
any
of
our
indian
affairs
please
ask
me
i
am
ready
to
tell
you
all
that
i
know
about
my
country
and
my
people
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
queen
wilhelmina
ii
of
august
sincere
thanks
for
your
long
letter
your
cordial
words
warmed
my
heart
shall
i
not
disappoint
you
upon
a
closer
acquaintance
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
am
very
ignorant
that
i
know
nothing
compared
to
you
i
feel
myself
sink
into
nothingness
you
are
well
informed
about
the
javanese
titles
before
you
mentioned
it
i
had
never
given
the
matter
a
thought
that
i
am
as
you
say
highly
born
am
i
a
princess
no
more
than
you
yourself
are
one
the
last
prince
of
our
house
from
whom
i
am
directly
descended
in
the
male
line
was
i
believe
generations
back
but
mamma
is
closely
related
to
the
princely
house
of
medeira
her
was
a
reigning
prince
and
her
grandmother
a
princess
but
we
do
not
give
a
for
all
that
to
my
mind
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
aristocracy
the
aristocracy
of
the
mind
and
the
aristocracy
of
the
soul
of
those
who
are
noble
in
spirit
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
commonplace
than
those
people
who
allow
themselves
to
depend
upon
their
so
called
high
birth
what
worth
is
there
in
simply
being
a
count
or
baron
i
can
not
see
it
with
my
little
understanding
adel
and
edel
twin
words
with
almost
the
same
sound
and
which
should
have
the
same
meaning
poor
twins
how
cruel
life
has
been
to
you
it
has
ruthlessly
torn
you
asunder
and
holds
you
now
so
far
apart
once
noble
meant
what
the
word
signifies
yes
then
indeed
it
would
have
been
an
honour
to
be
highly
born
but
now
i
remember
how
embarrassed
we
were
last
year
when
the
ladies
of
the
exposition
for
woman
work
called
us
the
princesses
of
java
in
holland
they
seem
to
think
that
everything
which
comes
out
of
india
which
is
not
a
baboe
or
a
spada
must
be
a
prince
or
a
princess
europeans
here
in
india
seldom
call
us
raden
adjeng
they
address
us
usually
as
freule
i
despair
of
its
ever
being
different
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
i
have
said
that
we
were
not
freules
and
still
less
princesses
but
they
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
glamour
and
still
obstinately
call
us
freule
not
long
ago
a
european
who
had
heard
much
of
us
came
here
and
asked
our
parents
to
be
allowed
the
privilege
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
princesses
we
were
brought
out
and
shown
to
him
as
though
we
had
been
dolls
how
stupid
we
felt
regent
said
he
to
our
father
but
quite
distinctly
before
us
there
was
much
disappointment
in
his
voice
at
the
word
princess
i
thought
of
glittering
garments
fantastic
oriental
splendour
and
your
daughters
look
so
simple
we
could
hardly
suppress
a
smile
when
we
heard
him
good
heavens
in
his
innocence
he
had
paid
us
the
greatest
possible
compliment
you
do
not
know
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
us
to
find
that
our
clothes
were
simple
we
had
so
often
taken
pains
to
put
on
nothing
that
would
look
conspicuous
or
bizarre
dear
stella
i
am
heartily
glad
that
i
seem
to
you
like
your
dutch
friends
and
that
you
find
me
congenial
i
have
always
been
an
enemy
of
formality
i
am
happy
only
when
i
can
throw
the
burden
of
javanese
etiquette
from
my
shoulders
the
ceremonies
the
little
rules
that
are
instilled
into
our
people
are
an
abomination
to
me
you
could
hardly
imagine
how
heavily
the
burden
of
etiquette
presses
upon
a
javanese
aristocratic
household
but
in
our
household
we
do
not
take
all
the
formalities
so
literally
we
often
dispense
with
ceremony
and
speak
our
own
sentiments
freely
javanese
etiquette
is
both
silly
and
terrible
europeans
who
live
years
in
india
and
who
come
in
close
contact
with
our
native
dignitaries
can
not
at
all
understand
it
unless
they
have
made
a
special
study
of
it
in
order
to
give
you
a
faint
idea
of
the
oppressiveness
of
our
etiquette
i
shall
mention
a
few
examples
a
younger
brother
or
sister
of
mine
may
not
pass
me
without
bowing
down
to
the
ground
and
creeping
upon
hands
and
knees
if
a
little
sister
is
sitting
on
a
chair
she
must
instantly
slip
to
the
ground
and
remain
with
head
bowed
until
i
have
passed
from
her
sight
if
a
younger
brother
or
sister
wishes
to
speak
to
me
it
must
only
be
in
high
javanese
and
after
each
sentence
that
comes
from
their
lips
they
must
make
a
sembah
that
is
to
put
both
hands
together
and
bring
the
thumbs
under
the
nose
if
my
brothers
and
sisters
speak
to
other
people
about
me
they
must
always
use
high
javanese
in
every
sentence
concerning
me
my
clothes
my
seat
at
the
table
my
hands
and
my
feet
and
everything
that
is
mine
they
are
forbidden
to
touch
my
honourable
head
without
my
high
permission
and
they
may
not
do
it
even
then
without
first
making
a
sembah
if
food
stands
on
the
table
they
must
not
touch
the
tiniest
morsel
till
it
has
pleased
me
to
partake
of
that
which
i
would
as
much
as
i
desire
should
you
speak
against
your
superiors
do
it
softly
so
that
only
those
who
are
near
may
hear
oh
yes
one
even
trembles
by
rule
in
a
noble
javanese
household
when
a
young
lady
laughs
she
must
not
open
her
mouth
for
heaven
sake
i
hear
you
exclaim
yes
dear
stella
you
shall
hear
stranger
things
than
these
if
you
wish
to
know
everything
about
us
javanese
if
a
girl
runs
she
must
do
it
decorously
with
little
mincing
steps
and
oh
so
slowly
like
a
snail
to
run
just
a
little
fast
is
to
be
a
hoyden
toward
my
older
brothers
and
sisters
i
show
every
respect
and
observe
all
forms
scrupulously
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
the
good
right
of
any
one
but
the
younger
ones
beginning
with
me
are
doing
away
with
all
ceremony
freedom
equality
and
fraternity
for
my
little
brothers
and
sisters
toward
me
and
toward
each
other
are
like
free
equal
comrades
between
us
there
is
no
stiffness
there
is
only
friendship
and
hearty
affection
the
sisters
say
thee
and
thou
to
me
and
we
speak
the
same
language
at
first
people
smiled
in
amazement
at
the
free
untrammeled
relationship
between
us
brothers
and
sisters
of
unequal
ages
we
were
called
children
without
any
bringing
up
and
i
was
a
koeda
koree
because
i
seldom
walked
sedately
but
went
skipping
along
and
they
were
further
horrified
because
i
often
laughed
aloud
and
allowed
my
teeth
to
show
but
now
that
they
see
how
affectionate
and
sweet
the
relationship
is
between
us
and
that
only
the
burdensome
etiquette
has
taken
flight
before
our
freedom
they
admire
the
harmonious
union
which
binds
us
so
closely
together
thank
you
dear
stella
for
your
charming
compliment
i
am
as
pleased
as
a
child
there
is
no
danger
of
spoiling
me
by
praise
or
i
should
long
ago
have
been
spoiled
to
death
both
at
home
and
by
my
friends
and
acquaintances
i
thank
you
so
much
for
the
friendly
thoughts
which
you
have
for
us
javanese
from
you
i
did
not
expect
anything
else
but
knew
that
you
would
have
the
same
feeling
for
all
people
white
or
brown
from
those
who
are
truly
civilized
and
enlightened
we
have
never
experienced
anything
but
kindness
if
a
javanese
is
ever
so
stupid
unlettered
uncivilized
the
power
which
governs
him
should
see
in
him
a
fellow
man
whom
god
has
created
too
one
who
has
a
heart
in
his
body
and
a
soul
full
of
sensitive
feeling
although
his
countenance
may
remain
immovable
and
not
a
glance
betray
his
inward
emotion
at
home
we
speak
javanese
with
one
another
dutch
only
with
hollanders
although
now
and
then
we
use
a
little
dutch
expression
which
has
a
shade
of
meaning
that
can
not
be
translated
often
it
is
to
express
some
little
humorous
point
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
as
a
noble
deed
in
holland
honourary
title
given
to
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
javanese
is
not
one
language
but
several
there
is
one
language
for
the
aristocracy
and
another
for
the
vulgar
a
nobleman
addresses
an
inferior
in
the
language
of
the
common
people
ngoko
o
with
ring
above
but
he
is
answered
in
high
javanese
known
as
krama
between
the
two
there
is
a
middle
speech
madja
used
in
familiar
intercourse
between
friends
and
equals
besides
or
court
speech
there
is
also
the
classical
language
kawi
nearly
allied
to
sanskrit
in
which
the
ancient
literature
of
java
is
written
wild
colt
iii
certainly
stella
i
can
not
thank
my
parents
enough
for
the
free
bringing
up
which
they
have
given
me
i
had
rather
have
my
whole
life
one
of
strife
and
sorrow
than
be
without
the
knowledge
which
i
owe
to
my
european
education
i
know
that
many
many
difficulties
await
me
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
future
i
can
not
remain
content
in
my
old
condition
yet
to
further
the
new
progress
i
can
do
nothing
a
dozen
strong
chains
bind
me
fast
to
my
world
what
will
be
the
outcome
all
my
european
friends
ask
themselves
this
question
did
i
know
myself
dear
people
i
should
tell
you
with
pleasure
all
can
see
that
the
situation
is
critical
for
us
and
then
they
say
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
my
father
to
give
me
the
little
education
which
i
have
had
no
no
not
on
my
dearest
father
lies
the
blame
no
and
again
no
father
could
not
foresee
that
the
same
bringing
up
which
he
gave
to
all
of
his
children
would
have
had
such
an
effect
upon
one
of
them
many
other
regents
had
given
to
their
families
the
same
advantages
that
we
have
had
and
it
has
never
resulted
in
anything
but
in
native
young
ladies
with
european
manners
who
speak
dutch
there
is
no
help
for
it
some
day
or
other
it
will
come
to
pass
must
come
to
pass
that
i
shall
have
to
follow
an
unknown
bridegroom
love
is
a
will
o
the
wisp
in
our
javanese
world
how
can
a
man
and
woman
love
each
other
when
they
see
each
other
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
after
they
are
already
fast
bound
in
the
chains
of
wedlock
i
shall
never
never
fall
in
love
to
love
there
must
first
be
respect
according
to
my
thinking
and
i
can
have
no
respect
for
the
javanese
young
man
how
can
i
respect
one
who
is
married
and
a
father
and
who
when
he
has
had
enough
of
the
mother
of
his
children
brings
another
woman
into
his
house
and
is
according
to
the
mohammedan
law
legally
married
to
her
and
who
does
not
do
this
and
why
not
it
is
no
sin
and
still
less
a
scandal
the
mohammedan
law
allows
a
man
to
have
four
wives
at
the
same
time
and
though
it
be
a
thousand
times
over
no
sin
according
to
the
mohammedan
law
and
doctrine
i
shall
for
ever
call
it
a
sin
i
call
all
things
sin
which
bring
misery
to
a
fellow
creature
sin
is
to
cause
pain
to
another
whether
man
or
beast
and
can
you
imagine
what
a
woman
must
suffer
when
her
husband
comes
home
with
another
a
rival
whom
she
must
recognize
as
his
legal
wife
he
can
torture
her
to
death
mistreat
her
as
he
will
if
he
does
not
choose
to
give
her
back
her
freedom
then
she
can
whistle
to
the
moon
for
her
rights
everything
for
the
man
and
nothing
for
the
woman
is
our
law
and
custom
do
you
understand
now
the
deep
aversion
i
have
for
marriage
i
would
do
the
humblest
work
thankfully
and
joyfully
if
by
it
i
could
be
independent
but
i
can
do
nothing
less
than
nothing
on
account
of
father
position
among
our
people
if
i
choose
to
work
it
would
have
to
be
at
something
fitting
it
is
only
work
for
pleasure
which
would
not
be
a
disgrace
to
my
noble
and
highly
placed
family
a
chain
of
regents
from
eastern
coast
to
the
middle
why
did
god
give
us
talents
and
not
the
opportunity
to
make
use
of
them
my
two
sisters
have
studied
drawing
and
painting
and
without
any
instruction
have
made
fair
progress
according
to
those
who
know
they
would
gladly
go
on
with
their
studies
but
here
in
java
there
is
no
opportunity
and
we
can
not
go
to
europe
to
go
there
we
should
have
to
have
the
consent
of
his
excellency
the
minister
of
finance
and
that
we
have
not
we
must
depend
entirely
upon
ourselves
if
we
wish
to
go
forward
o
stella
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
long
for
something
intensely
and
yet
to
feel
powerless
to
obtain
it
could
father
have
done
so
i
do
not
doubt
he
would
have
sent
us
without
hesitation
to
your
cold
and
distant
land
i
draw
and
paint
too
but
take
much
more
pleasure
in
the
pen
than
in
the
pencil
do
you
understand
now
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
obtain
the
mastery
of
your
beautiful
language
nay
do
not
contradict
me
i
construct
it
after
a
fashion
but
i
understand
my
limitations
all
too
well
if
i
could
learn
the
dutch
language
thoroughly
my
future
would
be
assured
a
rich
field
of
labour
would
then
lie
open
to
me
and
i
should
be
a
true
child
of
humanity
for
you
see
i
as
a
born
javanese
know
all
about
the
indian
world
a
european
no
matter
how
long
he
may
have
lived
in
java
and
studied
existing
conditions
can
still
know
nothing
of
the
inner
native
life
much
that
is
obscure
now
and
a
riddle
to
europeans
i
could
make
clear
with
a
few
words
i
feel
my
powerlessness
all
too
well
stella
you
would
burst
out
laughing
if
you
could
look
over
my
shoulder
and
read
this
little
sheet
of
paper
what
a
crazy
idea
of
mine
is
it
not
that
i
who
know
nothing
have
learned
nothing
should
wish
to
venture
upon
a
literary
career
still
though
every
one
else
should
laugh
at
me
i
know
that
you
will
not
i
will
not
think
that
for
a
moment
it
is
indeed
a
desperate
undertaking
but
he
who
does
not
dare
does
not
win
is
my
motto
forward
dare
mightily
and
with
strength
of
the
world
belongs
to
the
strong
you
ask
me
how
i
came
to
be
placed
between
four
thick
walls
you
certainly
thought
of
a
cell
or
something
of
that
kind
no
stella
my
prison
was
a
large
house
with
grounds
around
it
but
around
those
grounds
there
was
a
high
wall
and
that
held
me
a
prisoner
never
mind
how
splendid
a
house
and
garden
may
be
if
one
may
never
go
beyond
them
it
is
stifling
i
remember
how
often
in
dumb
despair
i
would
press
my
body
against
the
fast
closed
gate
and
the
cold
stones
whatever
direction
i
took
at
the
end
of
every
walk
there
was
always
a
stone
wall
or
a
locked
door
of
late
mevrouw
ovink
often
says
to
me
child
child
have
we
done
well
to
let
you
come
forth
from
the
high
walls
of
the
kaboepaten
would
it
not
have
been
better
if
we
had
let
you
remain
there
what
will
come
of
it
now
what
of
the
future
and
when
she
sees
us
drawing
and
painting
she
cries
full
of
distress
dear
children
is
there
nothing
else
for
you
but
this
no
the
only
fortunate
thing
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
us
is
that
we
three
were
thrust
out
into
the
light
luckily
i
am
optimistic
by
nature
and
do
not
quickly
let
my
head
hang
if
i
can
not
become
what
i
so
much
desire
to
be
then
i
would
rather
be
something
if
only
a
you
will
think
now
that
i
am
a
genius
in
cooking
my
family
and
friends
need
not
worry
about
my
future
do
you
not
agree
with
me
for
a
good
is
always
in
demand
and
can
always
get
along
the
official
salaries
in
holland
seem
small
compared
with
those
in
india
yet
they
are
always
complaining
here
about
the
small
salaries
in
india
too
one
is
entitled
to
a
pension
after
twenty
years
service
and
the
clergy
after
only
ten
years
india
is
an
el
dorado
for
the
officials
and
yet
many
hollanders
speak
of
it
as
a
horrible
i
get
so
infernally
mad
when
i
hear
them
speak
of
horrible
india
they
forget
all
too
often
that
this
horrible
fills
many
empty
pockets
with
gold
a
change
will
come
in
our
whole
native
world
the
turning
point
is
it
is
coming
but
when
will
it
be
that
is
the
great
question
we
can
not
hasten
the
hour
of
revolution
for
it
is
only
we
who
have
rebellious
thoughts
in
this
wilderness
this
dark
distant
land
beyond
which
there
is
no
land
my
friends
here
say
that
we
shall
act
wisely
if
we
do
nothing
but
sleep
for
a
hundred
years
when
we
awakened
java
would
be
more
as
we
would
have
her
work
among
the
people
of
india
i
know
mevrouw
sent
father
the
book
hoping
to
arouse
his
interest
but
he
would
rather
interest
himself
in
a
book
about
the
native
woman
i
had
thought
of
that
myself
i
have
much
to
tell
about
javanese
women
but
i
am
still
too
young
and
have
had
so
little
so
pitifully
little
experience
with
life
the
cause
for
which
i
would
speak
is
to
me
too
earnest
and
too
sacred
to
be
approached
lightly
i
can
not
write
now
as
i
wish
but
i
know
that
when
i
have
suffered
more
it
will
be
different
after
a
few
years
i
shall
have
had
a
more
comprehending
insight
into
much
that
i
would
know
and
many
thoughts
that
now
run
darkly
through
my
brain
will
have
grown
clear
i
can
not
tell
you
anything
of
the
mohammedan
law
stella
its
followers
are
forbidden
to
speak
of
it
with
those
of
another
faith
and
in
truth
i
am
a
mohammedan
only
because
my
ancestors
were
how
can
i
love
a
doctrine
which
i
do
not
know
may
never
know
the
koran
is
too
holy
to
be
translated
into
any
language
whatever
here
no
one
speaks
arabic
it
is
customary
to
read
from
the
koran
but
what
is
read
no
one
understands
to
me
it
is
a
silly
thing
to
be
obliged
to
read
something
without
being
able
to
understand
it
it
is
as
though
i
were
compelled
to
read
an
english
book
and
the
whole
thing
should
go
through
my
head
without
my
being
able
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
a
single
word
if
i
wished
to
know
and
understand
our
religion
i
should
have
to
go
to
arabia
to
learn
the
language
nevertheless
one
can
be
good
without
being
pious
is
not
that
true
stella
religion
is
intended
as
a
blessing
to
mankind
a
bond
between
all
the
creatures
of
god
they
should
be
as
brothers
and
sisters
not
because
they
have
the
same
human
parents
but
because
they
are
all
children
of
one
father
of
him
who
is
enthroned
in
the
heavens
above
brothers
and
sisters
must
love
one
another
help
strengthen
and
support
one
another
o
god
sometimes
i
wish
that
there
had
never
been
a
religion
because
that
which
should
unite
mankind
into
one
common
brotherhood
has
been
through
all
the
ages
a
cause
of
strife
of
discord
and
of
bloodshed
members
of
the
same
family
have
persecuted
one
another
because
of
the
different
manner
in
which
they
worshipped
one
and
the
same
god
those
who
ought
to
have
been
bound
together
by
the
tenderest
love
have
turned
with
hatred
from
one
another
differences
of
church
albeit
in
each
the
same
word
god
is
spoken
have
built
a
dividing
wall
between
two
throbbing
hearts
i
often
ask
myself
uneasily
is
religion
indeed
a
blessing
to
mankind
religion
which
is
meant
to
save
us
from
our
sins
how
many
sins
are
committed
in
thy
name
i
have
read
max
havelaar
though
i
do
not
know
wijs
mij
de
plaats
waar
ik
gezaaid
heb
i
shall
look
for
it
for
i
think
much
very
much
of
multatuli
i
will
tell
you
another
time
of
the
position
of
the
people
and
of
the
ruling
classes
among
us
i
have
written
too
much
already
and
that
is
a
subject
which
demands
no
small
space
what
do
we
speak
at
home
what
a
question
stella
dear
naturally
our
language
is
javanese
we
speak
malayish
with
strange
people
who
are
easterners
either
malays
moors
arabs
or
chinese
and
dutch
with
europeans
o
stella
how
i
laughed
when
i
read
your
question
would
your
parents
disapprove
if
you
should
embrace
them
heartily
why
i
have
yet
to
give
my
parents
or
my
brothers
and
sisters
the
first
kiss
kissing
is
not
customary
among
the
javanese
only
children
of
from
one
to
three
four
five
or
six
are
kissed
we
never
kiss
one
another
you
are
astonished
at
that
but
it
is
true
only
our
young
holland
friends
kiss
us
and
we
kiss
them
back
that
has
only
been
recently
at
first
we
loved
to
have
them
kiss
us
but
never
kissed
them
in
return
we
have
only
learned
to
kiss
since
we
have
been
such
friends
with
mevrouw
ovink
when
she
would
embrace
us
she
would
ask
us
to
kiss
her
at
first
we
found
it
queer
and
acquitted
ourselves
awkwardly
does
this
seem
strange
to
you
no
matter
how
much
i
should
love
one
of
my
dutch
friends
it
would
never
come
into
my
head
to
kiss
her
without
being
asked
you
ask
why
because
i
do
not
know
whether
she
would
like
it
it
is
pleasant
for
us
to
press
a
soft
white
cheek
with
our
lips
but
whether
the
possessor
of
that
pretty
cheek
also
finds
it
pleasant
to
feel
a
dark
face
against
hers
is
another
question
we
had
rather
let
people
think
us
heartless
for
of
our
own
accord
we
would
never
embrace
if
as
you
say
i
am
in
no
way
behind
many
dutch
girls
it
is
principally
the
work
of
mevrouw
ovink
who
used
to
talk
to
us
as
though
we
were
her
own
sisters
intercourse
with
this
cultured
dutch
lady
had
a
great
influence
upon
the
little
brown
girls
and
now
moesje
knows
very
well
that
though
time
and
distance
separate
them
the
hearts
of
her
daughters
will
always
belong
to
her
father
had
promised
us
in
reality
mevrouw
ovink
made
him
give
his
word
of
honour
to
let
us
go
to
djombang
mijnheer
ovink
will
take
us
there
by
and
by
we
love
them
so
much
have
so
much
love
for
our
father
and
mother
we
miss
them
sadly
i
can
not
even
now
realize
that
they
are
actually
gone
from
us
there
was
so
little
restraint
between
us
we
lived
all
the
time
so
cordially
together

that
the

is
unknown
throughout

in

mothers
kiss
their

sometimes
frighten

to
give

iv
o
dearest
dearest
mevrouwtje
what
a
delightful
sunday
we
had
yesterday
father
went
out
with
my
little
brother
and
after
awhile
they
came
back
home
brother
with
great
excitement
ran
to
me
and
said
o
sister
there
is
a
in
the
harbour
all
the
streets
are
filled
with
sailors
and
two
of
them
have
come
home
with
us
they
are
with
father
now
at
the
word
warship
we
sprang
up
as
though
we
had
been
shot
and
before
brother
had
finished
speaking
we
flew
to
our
room
to
make
ready
we
saw
two
gentlemen
dressed
in
white
come
hesitating
through
the
grounds
after
a
little
while
we
saw
them
sitting
with
pa
in
the
middle
gallery
later
a
boy
came
to
us
saying
that
we
must
go
to
father
which
we
did
with
the
greatest
willingness
one
two
three
and
we
had
slipped
on
our
best
kabaais
and
a
second
later
we
were
sitting
in
talking
to
two
officers
from
the
i
do
not
know
how
it
came
about
but
we
were
immediately
at
our
ease
and
spoke
to
the
gentlemen
as
though
we
had
known
them
for
years
but
how
did
these
people
happen
to
come
to
kaboepaten
i
will
explain
that
to
you
papa
went
as
i
have
said
for
a
little
drive
he
met
five
gentlemen
walking
three
of
them
turned
another
way
but
these
two
had
followed
carriage
in
to
the
kaboepaten
they
thought
the
gentlemen
were
new
to
java
that
the
way
the
carriage
took
was
a
public
road
and
our
house
a
fortress
or
something
of
the
kind
papa
sent
a
servant
to
ask
the
gentlemen
if
they
wished
to
see
him
they
were
embarrassed
naturally
because
they
had
made
such
a
mistake
and
followed
some
one
to
his
own
house
what
would
they
do
now
they
did
not
find
it
pleasant
by
any
means
because
they
did
not
understand
our
language
and
spoke
only
very
bad
broken
malayish
papa
put
an
end
to
this
awkward
situation
by
going
to
meet
them
himself
and
addressing
them
in
dutch
embarrassment
was
at
an
end
they
would
come
with
pleasure
into
the
house
it
turned
out
that
one
of
them
was
a
relative
of
some
one
whom
papa
knew
well
i
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
felt
so
much
at
my
ease
with
an
utter
stranger
i
did
not
think
once
of
the
fact
that
i
had
never
seen
these
people
before
and
had
not
known
of
their
existence
five
minutes
ago
it
is
strange
how
with
sailors
one
feels
at
home
right
away
our
hearts
have
always
been
set
upon
the
sea
everything
that
concerns
it
interests
us
you
know
well
what
a
delight
it
is
to
us
to
be
taken
out
even
in
a
little
row
boat
we
love
the
sea
you
remember
the
time
when
i
lay
in
the
bow
of
the
opium
skiff
even
then
i
found
it
pleasant
to
be
upon
such
a
bed
if
i
were
a
boy
i
should
not
think
twice
but
would
become
a
sailor
at
once
imagine
to
yourself
father
saying
to
the
gentlemen
my
daughters
would
be
so
pleased
if
they
could
be
permitted
to
go
on
board
father
knows
everything
that
goes
on
in
our
hearts
father
does
not
tell
us
so
yet
i
am
certain
of
it
now
and
then
papa
tells
one
or
the
other
of
us
precisely
what
we
have
been
thinking
something
that
we
had
kept
to
ourselves
and
never
told
to
any
one
it
is
without
doubt
because
father
loves
us
so
much
and
we
so
love
him
every
now
and
then
he
discovers
something
and
lays
it
bare
that
had
been
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
of
which
i
had
thought
no
one
except
myself
had
the
slightest
idea
does
not
that
show
true
kinship
of
soul
if
i
were
more
superstitious
i
should
certainly
think
that
papa
could
read
thoughts
but
i
am
telling
you
now
of
the
pleasant
sunday
morning
and
not
of
the
secret
that
runs
from
our
hearts
to
that
of
our
dearest
father
the
officers
regretted
so
much
that
the
would
not
remain
longer
in
our
harbour
it
would
have
been
such
a
pleasure
to
them
to
have
had
us
on
board
the
must
go
to
look
for
reefs
on
karimoen
djawa
though
the
commander
thought
japara
interesting
both
gentlemen
were
going
to
do
everything
in
their
power
to
persuade
the
commandant
to
come
back
for
if
the
set
out
from
soerabaja
on
monday
either
saturday
or
sunday
she
could
be
back
at
japara
if
fortune
should
bring
the
here
on
saturday
then
they
will
let
us
know
of
their
presence
by
letting
loose
their
cannon
i
have
no
idea
that
they
will
but
still
it
would
be
above
all
things
pleasant
if
the
boat
should
come
again
i
told
the
gentlemen
that
if
they
passed
japara
again
they
must
break
a
screw
or
something
near
our
coast
so
that
the
ship
would
be
obliged
to
lay
up
in
our
harbour
for
repairs
when
the
officers
had
gone
and
we
were
back
in
our
room
we
thought
it
had
been
a
dream
and
truly
it
was
as
though
we
had
dreamed
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
had
they
appeared
to
us
and
again
as
suddenly
had
they
vanished
a
very
pleasant
happening
do
you
not
think
so
too
i
still
have
to
laugh
whenever
i
think
of
that
funny
adventure
o
little
mother
dearest
mevrouwtje
i
wish
that
you
were
back
with
us
your
daughters
miss
you
so
much
we
long
for
the
pleasant
days
that
we
spent
with
you
to
come
again
the
splendid
times
that
we
used
to
have
in
your
dear
little
where
you
would
read
to
us
from
great
books
and
where
we
spoke
of
so
much
the
memory
of
which
shall
always
remain
with
us
i
miss
the
intimate
talks
with
you
when
i
used
to
tell
my
dear
little
mother
all
the
rebellious
thoughts
that
came
into
my
head
and
laid
bare
the
feelings
of
my
restless
heart
when
i
was
in
a
rebellious
mood
i
had
but
to
see
the
love
light
in
your
face
and
i
was
again
the
happy
careless
child
that
in
overflowing
good
spirits
could
sing
whatever
heaven
to
me
shall
send
i
set
my
shoulders
bravely
under
mevrouwtje
you
gave
us
too
much
care
spoiled
us
too
much
now
we
do
nothing
but
wish
for
those
happy
days
to
come
back
and
although
we
long
for
you
yet
we
hope
that
the
journey
to
djombang
will
be
put
off
as
long
as
possible
why
we
know
we
feel
that
at
djombang
we
shall
see
each
other
for
the
last
time
seeing
you
again
will
mean
farewell
for
good
you
will
not
come
to
japara
again
and
we
shall
never
be
able
to
go
to
you
for
that
reason
let
the
journey
be
put
off
as
long
as
possible
it
is
splendid
to
have
a
pleasure
to
look
forward
to
so
we
should
like
to
prolong
the
feeling
of
anticipation
once
more
the
joy
of
meeting
again
and
then
all
the
prettiness
will
be
over
no
it
will
not
be
over
even
then
the
memory
will
be
with
us
we
shall
still
be
happy
as
long
as
you
think
of
us
and
love
us
you
know
very
well
dear
little
mother
that
love
is
nothing
but
egoism
i
think
there
is
nothing
finer
than
to
be
able
to
call
a
happy
smile
to
a
loved
mouth
to
see
the
sunshine
break
over
another
face
nothing
is
more
splendid
than
to
have
a
pair
of
dear
eyes
look
at
one
full
of
love
and
happiness
then
it
is
that
one
feels
guilty
for
that
very
joy
how
pleasant
that
kokki
also
remembers
us
to
mevrouw
a
javanese
woman
dress
consists
of
a
sarong
which
is
draped
to
form
a
skirt
and
a
kabaja
or
jacket
shaped
garment
the
kabaja
is
of
dutch
origin
and
its
use
is
a
concession
to
european
ideas
of
modesty
as
formerly
the
upper
part
of
the
body
was
left
bare
v
january
to
go
to
europe
till
my
last
breath
that
shall
always
be
my
ideal
if
i
could
only
make
myself
small
enough
to
slip
into
an
envelope
then
i
would
go
with
this
letter
to
you
stella
and
to
my
dearest
best
brother
and
near
hush
not
another
word
it
is
not
my
fault
stella
if
now
and
then
i
write
nonsense
the
gamelan
in
the
pendopo
could
speak
to
you
better
than
i
now
it
is
playing
a
lovely
air
it
is
like
no
other
song
no
melody
each
note
is
so
soft
so
tender
so
vaguely
thrilling
so
changing
but
ah
how
compelling
how
bitterly
beautiful
that
is
no
tinkling
of
glass
of
copper
of
wood
it
is
the
voices
of
men
souls
that
speak
to
me
now
they
are
complaining
now
sighing
and
now
merrily
laughing
and
my
soul
soars
with
the
murmuring
pure
silver
tones
on
high
on
high
to
the
isles
of
blue
light
to
the
fleecy
clouds
and
towards
the
shining
stars
deep
low
tones
are
rising
now
and
the
music
leads
me
through
dark
dales
down
steep
ravines
through
sombre
woods
on
into
dense
wildernesses
and
my
soul
shivers
and
trembles
within
me
with
anguish
and
pain
and
sorrow
i
have
heard
ginonding
a
dozen
times
still
now
that
the
gamelan
is
silent
i
can
not
recall
a
single
note
everything
is
driven
from
my
memory
the
sad
and
lovely
air
is
gone
that
made
me
so
inexpressibly
happy
and
so
deeply
melancholy
at
the
same
time
i
can
never
hear
ginonding
without
deep
emotion
the
first
chords
of
the
splendid
prelude
and
i
am
lost
sometimes
i
do
not
wish
to
listen
it
is
too
sorrowful
yet
i
must
hearken
to
the
murmuring
voices
which
tell
me
of
the
past
and
of
the
future
the
breath
of
its
thrilling
silver
strains
blows
away
the
veil
which
covers
the
secrets
of
what
is
to
be
and
clear
as
though
it
were
today
visions
of
the
future
rise
to
my
mind
a
shivering
goes
through
me
for
i
see
dark
sombre
figures
i
try
to
close
my
eyes
but
they
remain
wide
open
and
at
my
feet
there
yawns
a
dizzy
abyss
but
i
look
up
and
a
blue
heaven
arches
above
me
and
golden
play
with
the
fleecy
white
clouds
and
in
my
heart
it
is
again
light
there
have
i
not
convinced
you
what
a
foolish
mad
creature
i
am
what
silly
thoughts
but
we
will
not
excuse
ourselves
to
each
other
stella
enough
of
that
i
will
now
try
to
talk
sensibly
like
a
rational
human
being
my
sunny
land
which
you
so
long
to
see
has
been
of
late
anything
but
sunny
there
have
been
terrible
rainstorms
every
day
and
sunday
the
japara
river
rose
from
its
banks
villages
were
flooded
and
even
the
city
itself
was
inundated
by
the
rushing
waters
ever
since
morning
it
has
rained
in
torrents
and
the
wind
has
shaken
our
house
frightfully
outside
several
trees
have
blown
down
the
thick
branches
were
broken
off
as
though
they
had
been
match
stems
and
nothing
remains
now
of
the
splendid
koolblanda
trees
but
two
cold
bare
trunks
how
terribly
the
kampongs
around
must
have
suffered
whole
roofs
have
been
torn
from
the
houses
today
papa
has
gone
out
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
to
succour
an
outlying
district
where
many
villages
are
under
water
papa
is
sore
pressed
in
these
days
first
it
was
storm
then
an
earthquake
now
again
storm
a
colossal
randoe
tree
was
blown
across
a
public
highway
striking
two
passersby
they
were
taken
from
under
it
ground
to
pieces
a
whole
day
and
a
whole
night
we
listened
to
the
raging
and
the
roaring
of
the
wind
poor
klein
scheveningen
the
storm
has
wrought
frightful
havoc
there
the
way
to
the
bath
house
is
entirely
covered
with
seething
water
and
the
beach
has
disappeared
the
insatiable
sea
has
covered
it
this
afternoon
if
it
is
not
raining
hard
i
shall
ask
father
permission
to
go
and
see
it
a
week
ago
we
were
on
klein
scheveningen
we
stood
on
a
great
rock
to
watch
the
surging
of
the
waves
we
were
so
intent
upon
the
imposing
spectacle
that
we
did
not
see
how
the
onrushing
waters
were
covering
our
rock
not
until
the
children
on
the
shore
called
to
us
affrighted
did
we
realize
that
we
were
surrounded
by
a
raging
surf
we
waded
back
to
the
children
through
water
up
to
our
knees
some
time
ago
you
asked
me
about
the
position
of
the
little
man
among
us
but
i
had
already
written
you
so
much
that
i
put
the
question
aside
because
it
could
not
be
answered
in
a
few
words
i
wished
however
to
come
back
to
it
another
time
and
so
i
come
to
it
now
i
shall
then
have
answered
the
whole
of
your
last
letter
i
thank
god
that
i
can
answer
no
to
your
question
as
to
whether
the
condition
of
our
people
is
as
sad
as
multatuli
has
described
it
no
the
history
of
saïdjah
and
adinda
belongs
to
the
past
there
may
be
hunger
sometimes
among
the
people
but
that
is
not
the
fault
of
their
rulers
the
rulers
can
not
be
held
responsible
for
the
long
droughts
when
the
little
man
needs
rain
so
much
for
his
fields
nor
can
they
be
blamed
for
the
floods
that
the
clouds
send
to
destroy
the
harvest
and
when
the
rice
harvest
fails
whether
it
be
through
a
plague
of
insects
or
through
floods
or
through
the
misfortunes
which
the
long
continued
east
wind
brings
then
all
the
people
who
suffer
from
these
calamities
have
their
taxes
remitted
by
the
government
and
in
time
of
famine
money
and
food
are
doled
out
to
them
if
the
fields
are
by
a
plague
of
mice
the
government
offers
rewards
for
the
destruction
of
the
pest
if
the
west
wind
as
now
causes
the
rising
of
the
waters
in
the
rivers
and
the
dikes
break
the
rulers
do
all
that
is
possible
to
mitigate
the
distress
last
year
a
fishing
village
lay
for
a
whole
week
under
water
day
and
night
father
remained
at
the
scene
of
the
disaster
out
of
special
funds
that
were
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
the
breaks
in
the
dikes
were
restored
for
some
kilometers
but
who
was
to
give
back
to
the
people
what
the
water
had
taken
away
from
them
and
what
of
the
fish
in
the
rivers
destroyed
by
the
floods
then
you
have
demak
in
my
uncle
jurisdiction
that
country
could
never
be
brought
to
a
condition
of
prosperity
whatever
one
might
do
from
one
remote
valley
to
the
other
the
east
wind
dries
up
the
rivers
and
then
the
west
wind
drowns
the
land
with
water
the
government
has
spent
tons
of
gold
to
give
water
to
the
land
in
the
dry
season
and
also
in
building
heavy
barriers
against
floods
in
the
wet
season
but
so
far
without
result
splendid
canals
have
been
dug
which
have
provided
work
for
thousands
it
is
true
but
they
appear
to
be
of
little
practical
value
during
the
east
winds
the
land
perishes
with
thirst
and
during
the
west
winds
everything
floats
upon
the
water
the
government
cares
much
for
the
of
the
people
of
java
but
alas
it
allows
them
to
be
burdened
by
heavy
taxes
under
the
load
of
which
they
can
move
but
slowly
no
stella
the
people
are
no
longer
wilfully
plundered
by
their
rulers
and
if
this
should
happen
but
a
single
time
the
guilty
one
would
be
deprived
of
his
office
be
degraded
but
an
evil
that
does
exist
is
the
taking
of
presents
that
even
i
think
as
wrong
and
shameful
as
the
forcible
taking
of
goods
belonging
to
the
little
man
as
in
max
havelaar
but
perhaps
i
would
not
judge
this
so
harshly
if
i
considered
the
circumstances
at
first
the
natives
thought
that
the
offering
of
gifts
to
their
superiors
was
a
mark
of
respect
a
declaration
of
homage
the
taking
of
presents
is
forbidden
to
the
magistrates
by
the
government
but
many
native
officials
are
so
that
it
is
a
wonder
how
they
can
get
along
at
all
on
their
meagre
salaries
a
district
registrar
who
all
day
long
writes
his
back
crooked
earns
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
incredibly
large
sum
of
florins
on
that
he
and
his
family
must
live
and
pay
house
rent
he
must
dress
himself
neatly
and
also
keep
up
his
prestige
over
the
lesser
officials
do
not
judge
them
harshly
but
rather
pity
these
children
for
that
is
what
my
are
for
the
most
part
if
a
district
writer
is
offered
something
perhaps
a
bunch
of
bananas
he
may
refuse
it
the
first
time
the
second
time
he
may
also
refuse
it
but
the
third
time
he
accepts
it
reluctantly
and
the
fourth
time
the
present
is
taken
without
hesitation
what
i
am
doing
is
no
harm
he
thinks
i
have
never
asked
for
it
and
yet
it
was
given
me
i
should
be
an
idiot
to
hesitate
when
it
is
the
custom
the
giving
of
presents
is
not
only
a
token
of
respect
but
also
a
safeguard
against
some
possible
misfortune
when
the
little
man
might
need
the
protection
of
the
one
in
authority
if
he
should
be
called
to
account
by
the
wedono
for
some
little
fault
or
other
then
he
can
count
upon
the
support
of
his
friend
the
district
writer
the
magistrates
are
poorly
paid
an
assistant
wedono
of
the
second
class
earns
florins
out
of
this
he
must
pay
a
secretary
assistant
wedonos
are
furnished
no
secretaries
by
the
government
although
they
have
as
much
need
of
written
work
as
wedonos
djaksas
and
others
they
must
keep
a
little
carriage
and
a
horse
and
even
a
riding
horse
for
journeys
into
the
country
they
must
buy
a
house
furniture
etc
they
have
the
expense
of
keeping
up
the
house
and
in
addition
the
entertainment
of
the
comptroller
the
regent
and
sometimes
also
the
when
they
come
on
tours
of
inspection
for
the
assistant
wedono
lives
far
from
the
capital
on
these
occasions
the
gentlemen
lodge
in
the
passangrahan
and
to
the
assistant
wedono
falls
the
high
honour
of
setting
the
food
before
their
noble
mouths
there
must
be
cigars
ajer
blanda
wines
delicacies
for
the
table
and
these
i
assure
you
are
for
an
under
district
chief
no
inconsiderable
expense
it
would
not
be
meet
to
set
before
his
honourable
guests
only
the
things
which
he
has
at
hand
so
all
these
table
luxuries
must
be
sent
for
to
the
city
it
is
not
a
law
but
the
host
considers
it
his
duty
to
set
before
the
grand
gentlemen
the
best
of
what
he
has
and
has
not
in
father
jurisdiction
this
does
not
occur
thank
god
when
father
goes
upon
a
tour
of
inspection
and
must
stay
several
days
he
always
takes
his
own
provisions
with
him
the
comptroller
too
does
this
and
also
the
and
no
native
official
is
ruined
by
the
single
cup
of
tea
which
he
offers
them
if
there
is
a
murder
or
a
robbery
in
the
under
district
the
assistant
wedono
must
naturally
clear
up
the
matter
it
is
his
duty
and
to
trace
out
the
guilty
one
he
must
go
deep
very
deep
into
his
own
purse
it
has
happened
many
times
that
the
native
chiefs
have
pawned
the
ornaments
of
their
wives
and
children
to
obtain
the
money
which
was
necessary
before
some
dark
deed
could
be
brought
into
the
light
but
will
that
money
which
is
paid
out
in
the
service
of
the
government
be
paid
back
by
the
government
i
wish
indeed
that
it
were
so
several
magistrates
have
been
reduced
to
beggary
in
this
way
what
in
heaven
name
can
the
magistrates
do
who
can
not
make
their
salaries
suffice
and
have
no
parents
or
other
relatives
upon
whom
they
can
fall
back
for
support
and
if
the
people
come
forward
with
gifts
when
they
see
their
wives
and
children
running
around
in
ragged
clothes
judge
them
not
harshly
stella
i
know
the
trials
of
the
native
chiefs
i
know
the
misery
of
the
people
and
what
is
the
government
going
to
do
now
it
is
going
to
reorganize
the
inland
administration
the
native
personnel
will
be
reduced
to
the
advantage
of
the
european
magistrates
from
this
reduction
there
will
be
saved
annually
an
expenditure
of
florins
and
the
european
magistrates
will
reap
the
benefit
of
this
it
is
true
that
there
are
some
officials
who
will
be
bettered
financially
and
will
become
assistant
wedonas
instead
of
government
clerks
but
what
does
that
signify
in
comparison
with
the
many
important
posts
it
has
not
yet
been
demonstrated
that
they
are
superfluous
that
will
be
abolished
there
are
all
kinds
of
rumours
about
the
government
regulations
the
bill
for
this
has
passed
both
chambers
of
the
volks
vertegenwoordigers
and
on
july
of
next
year
it
will
go
into
effect
nearly
all
of
the
residents
have
protested
but
his
excellency
the
governor
general
wishes
it
so
in
spite
of
all
protests
the
will
proceed
i
hope
that
the
government
will
eat
no
bitter
fruit
as
a
result
and
now
about
the
people
about
the
inhabitants
of
java
in
general
the
javanese
are
children
what
has
the
government
done
to
further
their
development
for
the
noble
sons
of
the
country
there
are
so
called
high
schools
normal
schools
and
the
school
and
for
the
people
there
are
various
common
schools
one
in
each
district
though
the
government
has
divided
these
latter
institutions
into
two
classes
the
first
class
composed
of
schools
which
are
situated
in
the
provincial
capitals
are
conducted
just
as
they
were
before
the
division
but
in
the
schools
of
the
second
class
the
children
learn
only
javanese
reading
writing
and
a
little
reckoning
no
malay
is
taught
as
formerly
why
it
is
not
made
clear
the
government
believes
to
my
thinking
that
if
the
people
were
educated
they
would
no
longer
be
willing
to
work
the
land
father
sent
a
note
to
the
government
on
the
subject
of
education
o
stella
i
wish
that
you
could
read
it
you
must
know
that
many
of
the
native
rulers
rejoice
at
the
action
of
the
government
the
javanese
nobles
are
in
favour
with
the
government
here
and
in
the
motherland
and
everything
possible
is
done
to
help
them
and
to
make
them
blossom
to
perfection
the
aristocracy
sees
with
sad
eyes
how
sons
of
the
people
are
educated
and
often
even
elevated
to
their
ranks
by
the
government
because
of
knowledge
ability
and
industry
sons
of
the
people
go
to
european
schools
and
compare
favourably
in
every
respect
with
the
high
and
honourable
sons
of
the
noble
the
nobles
wish
to
have
rights
for
themselves
alone
they
alone
wish
to
have
authority
and
to
make
western
civilization
and
enlightenment
their
own
and
the
government
helps
and
supports
them
in
this
for
it
is
to
its
own
advantage
to
do
so
as
early
as
there
was
a
decree
that
without
the
special
permission
of
his
excellency
the
governor
general
no
native
child
from
six
to
seven
years
old
would
be
admitted
to
the
free
grammar
school
for
europeans
that
could
not
speak
dutch
how
can
a
native
child
of
six
or
seven
years
learn
dutch
he
would
have
had
to
have
a
dutch
governess
and
then
before
he
is
able
to
learn
the
netherland
language
the
child
must
first
know
his
own
language
and
necessarily
know
how
to
read
and
write
it
is
only
regents
who
do
not
have
to
ask
permission
for
their
families
to
go
to
the
european
schools
most
of
the
native
chiefs
are
afraid
of
receiving
a
no
in
answer
to
their
request
and
therefore
do
nothing
is
it
presumptuous
of
father
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
african
and
ambonese
children
may
go
directly
to
the
european
schools
without
understanding
a
word
of
dutch
stella
i
remember
well
from
my
own
school
days
that
many
european
children
went
to
school
who
knew
as
little
dutch
as
i
and
i
hardly
knew
any
father
says
in
his
note
that
the
government
can
not
set
the
rice
upon
the
table
for
every
javanese
and
see
that
he
partakes
of
it
but
it
can
clear
the
board
where
the
food
is
to
be
spread
and
that
food
is
education
when
the
government
provides
a
means
of
education
for
the
people
it
is
as
though
it
placed
torches
in
their
hands
which
enabled
them
to
find
the
good
road
that
leads
to
the
place
where
the
rice
is
served
i
will
not
quote
any
further
stella
perhaps
another
time
i
can
send
you
the
whole
note
from
it
you
will
learn
something
of
the
present
condition
of
the
people
father
wishes
to
do
everything
that
he
can
to
help
the
people
and
needless
to
say
i
am
on
his
side
father
is
very
proud
of
his
ancient
noble
race
but
right
is
right
and
justice
is
justice
we
wish
to
equal
the
europeans
in
education
and
enlightenment
and
the
rights
which
we
demand
for
ourselves
we
must
also
give
to
others
this
putting
of
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way
of
the
education
of
the
people
may
well
be
compared
to
the
acts
of
the
tsar
who
while
he
is
preaching
peace
to
the
world
tramples
under
foot
the
good
right
of
his
own
subjects
measure
with
two
measures
no
the
europeans
are
troubled
by
many
traits
in
the
javanese
by
their
indifference
and
lack
of
initiative
very
well
netherlander
if
you
are
troubled
so
much
by
these
things
why
do
you
not
do
something
to
remedy
the
cause
why
is
it
that
you
do
not
stretch
forth
a
single
finger
to
help
your
brown
brother
draw
back
the
thick
veil
from
his
understanding
open
his
eyes
you
will
see
that
there
is
in
him
something
else
besides
an
inclination
for
mischief
which
springs
principally
from
stupidity
and
ignorance
i
should
not
have
to
seek
far
for
examples
of
this
nor
would
you
stella
here
before
you
lie
the
innermost
thoughts
of
one
who
belongs
to
that
despised
brown
race
they
are
not
able
to
judge
us
and
the
things
that
we
do
and
leave
undone
do
they
know
us
no
even
as
little
as
we
know
them
if
you
are
interested
in
this
subject
get
the
october
number
of
it
contains
an
address
delivered
by
my
brother
in
the
dutch
language
at
the
literary
congress
at
ghent
professor
kern
took
him
there
and
asked
him
to
speak
the
sentiments
to
which
he
gives
utterance
are
also
mine
they
are
ours
has
your
father
much
power
you
ask
what
is
power
father
has
great
influence
but
the
governor
alone
has
power
my
brother
pleaded
for
the
use
of
the
dutch
language
officially
read
what
he
says
stella
if
not
for
your
own
satisfaction
then
because
i
wish
it
the
hollanders
laugh
and
make
fun
of
our
stupidity
but
if
we
strive
for
enlightenment
then
they
assume
a
defiant
attitude
toward
us
what
have
i
not
suffered
as
a
child
at
school
through
the
ill
will
of
the
teachers
and
of
many
of
my
fellow
pupils
not
all
of
the
teachers
and
pupils
hated
us
many
loved
us
quite
as
much
as
the
other
children
but
it
was
hard
for
the
teachers
to
give
a
native
the
highest
mark
never
mind
how
well
it
may
have
been
deserved
i
shall
relate
to
you
the
history
of
a
gifted
and
educated
javanese
the
boy
had
passed
his
examinations
and
was
number
one
in
one
of
the
three
principal
high
schools
of
java
both
at
semarang
where
he
went
to
school
and
at
batavia
where
he
stood
his
examinations
the
doors
of
the
best
houses
were
open
to
the
amiable
with
his
agreeable
and
cultivated
manners
and
great
modesty
every
one
spoke
dutch
to
him
and
he
could
express
himself
in
that
language
with
distinction
fresh
from
this
environment
he
went
back
to
the
house
of
his
parents
he
thought
it
would
be
proper
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
authorities
of
the
place
and
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
resident
who
had
heard
of
him
and
here
it
was
that
my
friend
made
a
mistake
he
dared
to
address
the
great
man
in
dutch
the
following
morning
notice
of
an
appointment
as
clerk
to
a
comptroller
in
the
mountains
was
sent
to
him
there
the
young
man
must
remain
to
think
over
his
misdeeds
and
forget
all
that
he
had
learned
at
the
schools
after
some
years
a
new
comptroller
or
possibly
assistant
comptroller
came
then
the
measure
of
his
misfortunes
was
made
to
overflow
the
new
chief
was
a
former
one
who
had
never
shone
through
his
abilities
the
young
man
who
had
led
his
classes
in
everything
must
now
creep
upon
the
ground
before
the
dunce
and
speak
always
high
javanese
to
him
while
he
himself
was
answered
in
bad
malay
can
you
understand
the
misery
of
a
proud
and
independent
spirit
so
humbled
and
how
much
strength
of
character
it
must
have
taken
to
endure
that
petty
and
annoying
oppression
but
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
betook
himself
to
batavia
and
asked
his
excellency
the
governor
general
for
an
audience
it
was
granted
him
the
result
was
that
he
was
sent
to
preanger
with
a
commission
to
make
a
study
of
the
rice
culture
there
he
made
himself
of
service
through
the
translation
of
a
pamphlet
on
the
cultivation
of
water
crops
from
dutch
into
javanese
and
sundanese
the
government
presented
him
in
acknowledgement
with
several
hundred
guilders
in
the
comptroller
school
at
batavia
a
teacher
place
was
vacant
a
teacher
of
the
javanese
language
be
it
understood
and
his
friends
among
the
javanese
did
all
in
their
power
to
secure
this
position
for
him
but
without
result
it
was
an
absurd
idea
for
a
native
to
have
european
pupils
who
later
might
become
ruling
government
officials
perish
the
thought
i
should
like
to
ask
who
could
teach
javanese
better
than
a
born
javanese
the
young
man
went
back
to
his
dwelling
place
in
the
meantime
another
resident
had
come
and
the
talented
son
of
the
brown
race
might
at
last
become
an
assistant
wedono
not
for
nothing
had
he
been
banished
for
years
to
that
distant
place
he
had
learned
wisdom
there
namely
that
one
can
not
serve
a
european
official
better
than
by
creeping
in
the
dust
before
him
and
by
never
speaking
a
single
word
of
dutch
in
his
presence
others
have
now
come
into
power
and
lately
when
the
position
of
translator
of
the
javanese
language
became
vacant
it
was
offered
to
our
friend
truly
opportunely
now
that
he
does
not
stand
in
any
way
stella
i
know
an
assistant
resident
who
speaks
malay
with
a
regent
although
he
knows
that
the
latter
speaks
good
dutch
every
one
else
converses
confidentially
with
this
native
ruler
but
the
assistant
resident
never
my
brothers
speak
in
high
javanese
to
their
superiors
who
answer
them
in
dutch
or
in
malay
those
who
speak
dutch
to
them
are
our
personal
friends
several
of
whom
have
asked
my
brothers
to
speak
to
them
in
the
dutch
language
but
they
prefer
not
to
do
it
and
father
also
never
does
the
boys
and
father
know
all
too
well
why
they
must
hold
to
the
general
usage
there
is
too
much
idle
talk
about
the
word
prestige
through
the
imaginary
dignity
of
the
under
officials
i
do
not
bother
about
prestige
i
am
only
amused
at
the
manner
in
which
they
preserve
their
prestige
over
us
javanese
sometimes
i
can
not
suppress
a
smile
it
is
distinctly
diverting
to
see
the
great
men
try
to
inspire
us
with
awe
i
had
to
bite
my
lips
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
when
i
was
on
a
journey
not
long
ago
and
saw
an
assistant
resident
go
from
his
office
to
his
house
under
the
shade
of
a
gold
umbrella
which
a
servant
held
spread
above
his
noble
head
it
was
such
a
ridiculous
spectacle
heavens
if
he
only
knew
how
the
humble
crowds
who
respectfully
retreated
to
one
side
before
the
glittering
sunshade
immediately
his
back
was
turned
burst
out
laughing
there
are
many
yes
very
many
government
officials
who
allow
the
native
rulers
to
kiss
their
feet
and
their
knees
kissing
the
foot
is
the
highest
token
of
respect
that
we
javanese
can
show
to
our
parents
or
elderly
blood
relatives
and
to
our
own
rulers
we
do
not
find
it
pleasant
to
do
this
for
strangers
no
the
european
makes
himself
ridiculous
in
our
eyes
whenever
he
demands
from
us
those
tokens
of
respect
to
which
our
own
rulers
alone
have
the
right
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
when
residents
and
assistant
residents
allow
themselves
to
be
called
kandjeng
but
when
overseers
railroad
engineers
and
perhaps
tomorrow
too
allow
themselves
to
be
thus
addressed
by
their
servants
it
is
absurdly
funny
do
these
people
really
know
what
kandjeng
means
it
is
a
title
that
the
natives
give
to
their
hereditary
rulers
i
used
to
think
that
it
was
only
natural
for
the
stupid
javanese
to
love
all
this
but
now
i
see
that
the
civilized
enlightened
westerner
is
not
averse
to
it
that
he
is
daft
about
it
i
never
allow
women
older
than
i
to
show
all
the
prescribed
ceremonies
to
me
even
though
i
know
they
would
gladly
for
though
i
am
so
young
i
am
a
scion
of
what
they
consider
an
ancient
noble
and
honoured
house
for
which
in
the
past
they
have
poured
out
both
blood
and
gold
in
large
measure
it
is
strange
how
attached
inferiors
are
to
those
above
them
but
to
me
it
goes
against
the
grain
when
people
older
than
i
creep
in
the
dust
before
me
with
heavy
hearts
many
europeans
here
see
how
the
javanese
whom
they
regard
as
their
inferiors
are
slowly
awakening
and
at
every
turn
a
brown
man
comes
up
who
shows
that
he
has
just
as
good
brains
in
his
head
and
a
just
as
good
heart
in
his
body
as
the
white
man
but
we
are
going
forward
and
they
can
not
hold
back
the
current
of
time
i
love
the
hollanders
very
very
much
and
i
am
grateful
for
everything
that
we
have
gained
through
them
many
of
them
are
among
our
best
friends
but
there
are
also
others
who
dislike
us
for
no
other
reason
than
we
are
bold
enough
to
emulate
them
in
education
and
culture
in
many
subtle
ways
they
make
us
feel
their
dislike
i
am
a
european
you
are
a
javanese
they
seem
to
say
or
i
am
the
master
you
the
governed
not
once
but
many
times
they
speak
to
us
in
broken
malay
although
they
know
very
well
that
we
understand
the
dutch
language
it
would
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
in
what
language
they
addressed
us
if
the
tone
were
only
polite
not
long
ago
a
raden
ajoe
was
talking
to
a
gentleman
and
impulsively
she
said
sir
excuse
me
but
may
i
make
a
friendly
request
please
speak
to
me
in
your
own
language
i
understand
and
speak
malay
very
well
but
alas
only
high
malay
i
do
not
understand
this
how
our
gentleman
hung
his
head
why
do
many
hollanders
find
it
unpleasant
to
converse
with
us
in
their
own
language
oh
yes
now
i
understand
dutch
is
too
beautiful
to
be
spoken
by
a
brown
mouth
a
few
days
ago
we
paid
a
visit
to
totokkers
their
domestics
were
old
servants
of
ours
and
we
knew
that
they
could
speak
and
understand
dutch
very
well
i
told
the
host
this
and
what
answer
did
i
receive
from
my
gentleman
no
they
must
not
speak
dutch
no
why
i
asked
because
natives
ought
not
to
know
dutch
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
and
a
satirical
smile
quivered
at
the
corners
of
my
mouth
the
gentleman
grew
fiery
red
mumbled
something
into
his
beard
and
discovered
something
interesting
in
his
boots
at
least
he
devoted
all
of
his
attention
to
them
still
another
little
story
it
happened
in
the
preanger
it
was
in
the
early
evening
and
the
regent
of
x
was
receiving
visitors
in
his
kaboepaten
there
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
resident
of
the
department
afterwards
a
little
came
in
and
joined
the
company
the
son
of
the
house
a
at
home
on
his
vacation
ran
into
the
pendopo
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
his
father
was
not
alone
he
started
to
turn
back
but
the
resident
had
seen
him
and
called
him
his
excellency
greeted
the
youth
cordially
and
had
a
long
and
friendly
talk
with
him
when
the
conversation
with
his
excellency
was
over
he
went
up
to
the
young
official
and
made
a
polite
bow
the
little
gentleman
saw
no
necessity
for
answering
the
courteous
greeting
with
more
than
barely
noticeable
nod
of
the
head
and
while
his
cold
eyes
took
in
the
boy
disdainfully
from
head
to
foot
he
said
coolly
the
little
word
tabee
a
malay
greeting
the
young
man
turned
pale
his
lips
trembled
two
fists
were
clenched
afterwards
he
said
to
the
intimate
friend
who
had
been
present
sir
i
like
the
hollanders
very
much
they
are
among
my
best
friends
but
i
shall
never
be
able
to
forget
the
tabee
of
that
assistant
it
cut
me
to
the
soul
oh
stella
i
have
had
glimpses
into
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
indian
society
involuntarily
i
see
behind
the
curtain
of
the
official
world
there
are
abysses
so
deep
that
the
very
thought
of
them
makes
me
dizzy
o
god
why
is
the
world
still
so
full
of
evil
deeds
of
horror
and
of
sadness
there
are
residents
and
assistant
residents
compared
to
whom
slijmering
in
max
havelaar
is
a
saint
but
i
do
not
wish
to
turn
my
letter
into
a
scandal
chronicle
oh
now
i
understand
why
they
are
opposed
to
the
education
of
the
javanese
when
the
javanese
becomes
educated
then
he
will
no
longer
say
amen
to
everything
that
is
suggested
to
him
by
his
superiors
in
the
last
few
days
articles
written
by
natives
have
been
published
in
the
the
foremost
paper
of
india
in
these
articles
they
lay
bare
the
opinions
which
have
secretly
been
held
for
years
about
not
all
but
by
far
the
greater
number
of
indian
officials
not
only
the
highest
in
the
land
but
also
the
most
humble
are
allowing
their
voices
to
be
heard
the
paper
calls
this
a
good
sign
of
the
times
and
rejoices
what
the
european
officials
in
general
think
i
do
not
know
a
comptroller
who
is
one
of
the
organizers
of
the
inland
administration
says
that
good
will
come
of
it
not
only
to
the
europeans
but
also
to
the
native
rulers
he
is
pleading
for
a
trained
corps
of
native
officials
the
proposition
will
come
before
both
chambers
of
the
states
general
soon
it
is
also
urged
that
the
dutch
language
be
used
officially
in
business
between
european
and
native
chiefs
splendid
then
my
brother
does
not
stand
alone
in
july
the
question
of
the
education
of
women
will
come
up
too
the
javanese
are
emancipating
themselves
still
this
is
only
a
beginning
and
it
is
splendid
that
men
of
influence
and
ability
are
supporting
our
cause
the
strife
will
be
violent
the
combatants
will
not
have
to
fight
against
opposition
alone
but
also
against
the
indifference
of
our
own
countrywomen
in
whose
behalf
they
would
break
their
lances
while
this
agitation
among
the
men
is
on
the
tapis
that
will
be
the
time
for
the
women
to
rise
up
and
let
themselves
be
heard
poor
men
you
will
have
your
hands
full
oh
it
is
splendid
just
to
live
in
this
age
the
transition
of
the
old
into
the
new
i
read
the
other
day
turn
not
away
you
who
are
old
of
days
from
everything
that
is
new
consider
all
that
is
now
old
has
once
been
new
i
quote
from
memory
i
have
written
so
much
i
hope
that
i
have
not
made
you
weary
and
forgive
me
if
i
have
been
carried
away
by
my
enthusiasm
and
have
here
and
there
written
something
that
may
cause
you
pain
stella
forgive
me
for
having
forgotten
so
entirely
to
whom
i
was
speaking
i
find
such
great
sympathy
in
you
you
have
told
me
that
you
and
i
were
kindred
spirits
and
even
as
such
have
i
considered
you
i
am
no
javanese
no
child
of
the
despised
brown
race
to
you
and
to
me
you
do
not
belong
to
that
white
race
around
us
that
holds
the
javanese
up
to
scorn
and
ridicule
you
are
white
to
me
in
your
understanding
of
the
truth
white
in
heart
and
soul
for
you
i
have
a
great
admiration
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
many
of
my
fellow
countrywomen
would
do
likewise
if
they
knew
you
o
that
all
hollanders
were
like
you
and
some
of
my
other
white
friends
i
have
ordered
berthold
meryan
but
up
to
the
present
time
i
have
not
received
it
most
likely
the
had
first
to
order
it
from
holland
i
have
read
lately
modern
women
translated
from
the
french
by
jeanette
van
riemsdijk
disappointed
i
laid
the
book
down
i
had
seen
so
many
brilliant
criticisms
of
this
problem
novel
it
was
said
to
be
in
all
respects
finer
than
hilda
van
suylenburg
to
be
powerful
and
without
faults
but
for
myself
i
still
think
the
ratoe
princess
of
all
that
up
to
now
has
been
written
concerning
woman
emancipation
i
am
on
the
lookout
now
for
a
critic
to
whom
i
may
speak
my
mind
about
modern
women
for
to
my
thinking
that
book
lacks
the
strength
and
inspiration
of
i
read
through
in
one
sitting
i
locked
myself
in
our
room
and
forgot
everything
i
could
not
lay
it
down
it
held
me
so
it
is
a
pity
that
my
is
lost
i
would
ask
you
to
read
what
i
had
written
there
it
is
an
outline
of
a
translation
from
the
english
and
called
the
aim
of
the
woman
movement
i
know
of
nothing
better
than
that
having
been
in
the
or
even
in
the
wetenschappelijke
bladen
and
then
what
you
must
read
if
you
do
not
already
know
it
is
de
wajang
orang
by
martine
tonnet
it
is
in
the
november
number
it
is
about
the
javanese
and
their
art
and
the
court
of
djokjakarta
very
interesting
you
would
enjoy
it
i
have
just
read
for
the
second
time

what
a
brilliant
man
he
is
i
am
glad
that
soon
a
cheap
edition
of
all
his
works
will
appear
i
shall
be
very
affectionate
to
father
the

through
him
we
hear
strange
stories
from
the
life
history
of

are

to
lay
aside
money
when

in

the

wishes

and
must
needs
begin
by
teaching
the

and

which
is
the

the

but
is
an
intellectual

everything
to
be

intellectual

the
most
serious
fault
of

is
idleness
it
is
a
great
drawback
to
the
prosperity
of
java
so
many
latent
powers
lie
undeveloped
through
indolence
the
high
born
javanese
would
rather
suffer
bitter
want
and
misery
than
have
plenty
if
he
must
work
nothing
less

our
people
are
not
rich
in
ideals
but
an
example
which
speaks
would
impress
them
they
would
be
impelled
to
follow
it
my
sisters
and
i
wish
to
go
before
and
lighten
the
way
for
that
reason
we
want
more
than
anything
else
to
go
to
holland
to
study
it
will
be
well
with
us
if
we
can
go
little
mother
help
us
when
we
come
back
to
java
we
shall
open
a
school
for
girls
of
the
nobility
if
we
can
not
get
the
means
through
our
government
then
we
will
work
for
it
in
some
other
way
ask
our
friends
to
subscribe
start
a
lottery
or
something
the
means
will
be
found
when
we
are
ready
to
do
the
work
but
i
am
running
ahead
because
we
have
the
hardest
struggle
here
at
home
with
father
consent
we
should
be
richer
than
queens
if
we
could
only
have
that
it
is
frightful
to
be
a
javanese
girl
and
to
have
a
sensitive
heart
poor
poor
parents
what
a
fate
was
yours
to
have
such
daughters
we
hope
and
pray
fervently
that
they
may
be
blessed
with
a
long
life
and
that
later
they
will
be
proud
of
us
even
though
we
do
not
walk
abroad
under
glittering
golden
sunshades
i
will
work
hard
over
the
dutch
language
so
that
i
can
have
it
completely
under
my
thumb
and
do
with
it
as
i
will
and
then
i
shall
seek
through
means
of
my
pen
to
arouse
the
sympathy
of
those
who
are
able
to
help
us
in
our
work
to
improve
the
lot
of
the
javanese
woman
poor
fool
i
hear
you
say
if
you
push
will
all
your
might
against
the
gigantic
structure
of
ignorance
will
you
be
able
to
it
but
we
will
push
little
mother
with
all
our
strength
and
if
only
one
stone
of
it
falls
out
we
shall
not
have
worked
in
vain
but
first
we
are
going
to
seek
the
of
the
best
and
most
enlightened
men
in
java
even
one
of
them
could
help
us
we
wish
to
form
an
alliance
with
our
enlightened
progressive
men
to
seek
their
friendship
and
after
that
their
with
us
we
are
not
giving
battle
to
men
but
to
old
edicts
and
conventions
that
are
not
worthy
of
the
javanese
of
the
future
that
future
of
which
we
and
a
few
others
are
the
forerunners
throughout
all
ages
the
pioneers
in
the
struggle
against
tradition
have
suffered
we
know
that
call
us
mad
foolish
what
you
will
we
can
not
help
it
it
is
in
our
blood
grandfather
was
a
pioneer
half
a
century
ago
he
gave
his
sons
and
daughters
a
european
education
we
have
no
right
to
be
passive
to
do
nothing
adeldom
verplicht
excelsior
we
wish
that
we
could
make
common
cause
now
with
the
men
of
the
younger
generation
but
if
we
did
we
should
be
distrusted
at
once
friendship
between
unmarried
women
and
men
whether
married
or
not
would
not
be
understood
later
when
we
shall
have
gained
our
independence
it
will
be
different
my
brother
knows
many
progressive
young
men
personally
and
through
correspondence
we
know
that
there
are
men
who
appreciate
a
thinking
educated
woman
i
heard
a
man
say
once
he
was
a
highly
placed
native
official
that
the
companionship
of
a
woman
who
was
educated
and
enlightened
was
a
great
comfort
and
support
to
a
man
mevrouw
a
pajoeng

viii
what
language
however
powerful
can
express
every
emotion
of
the
soul
it
can
not
be
done
it
is
impossible
i
believe
with
you
that
it
is
impossible
at
least
as
far
as
writing
and
speaking
go
but
there
is
a
silent
secret
language
which
never
expresses
itself
in
words
or
written
signs
and
yet
is
understood
and
comprehended
by
every
one
who
has
faith
because
in
its
whole
vocabulary
the
little
word
lie
is
unknown
it
is
the
pure
chaste
language
of
the
eyes
the
clear
mirrors
of
the
soul
and
if
you
could
have
seen
me
this
morning
as
five
delicate
scented
leaves
quivered
in
my
trembling
hands
and
warm
tears
coursed
down
my
cheeks
you
could
without
hearing
a
single
sound
from
my
lips
have
understood
what
i
felt
neither
the
mouth
nor
the
pen
can
express
it
but
the
eyes
drowned
in
a
flood
of
tears
were
raised
on
high
as
though
to
seek
among
the
angels
of
god
the
ones
who
with
tender
wings
came
down
to
us
who
were
sad
and
wept
bitterly
upon
earth
to
comfort
and
fill
us
with
heavenly
joy
every
heart
beat
every
pulse
beat
and
each
indrawing
of
the
breath
was
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
we
are
only
ordinary
human
beings
a
mixture
of
evil
and
of
good
like
millions
of
others
can
it
be
that
at
first
glance
there
is
more
of
good
than
evil
in
us
one
does
have
to
seek
far
for
the
cause
of
this
when
one
lives
among
innocent
surroundings
it
is
not
hard
to
be
good
one
does
that
of
oneself
and
it
is
certainly
no
credit
to
do
no
evil
when
one
has
had
no
opportunity
later
when
we
have
flown
from
the
warm
parental
nest
and
are
in
the
midst
of
ordinary
human
life
where
no
faithful
parent
arm
is
thrown
protectingly
around
us
when
the
storms
of
life
rage
and
rave
above
our
heads
and
no
loving
hands
support
us
and
hold
us
fast
as
our
feet
waver
then
for
the
first
time
you
will
see
what
we
are
oh
i
pray
so
fervently
that
we
may
never
add
to
the
mountain
of
disappointment
which
life
has
already
brought
to
you
another
just
as
fervent
prayer
do
not
think
us
beautiful
it
can
not
be
otherwise
some
day
you
will
be
disappointed
and
that
would
cause
us
bitter
grief
now
slowly
by
bits
and
pieces
i
shall
tell
you
truthfully
nearly
all
that
i
can
about
ourselves
so
that
you
can
have
some
insight
into
our
true
characters
and
will
not
in
your
great
goodness
endow
us
with
fine
attributes
which
we
have
not
still
a
whole
lifetime
lies
before
us
let
us
see
what
can
be
made
of
it
i
feel
so
much
for
the
cause
of
woman
i
am
touched
by
her
fate
she
is
still
unappreciated
and
misunderstood
in
many
lands
even
in
this
our
age
of
light
i
would
help
her
so
earnestly
and
so
willingly
thank
you
for
these
splendid
sympathetic
words
in
them
your
great
compassion
speaks
your
deep
pity
for
the
suffering
of
woman
who
through
the
ages
has
endured
wrong
from
her
fellow
creature
man
i
thank
god
that
there
are
some
who
are
noble
in
heart
and
spirit
and
feel
for
the
sad
fate
of
our
native
women
and
wish
to
send
light
into
their
poor
dark
world
white
sister
with
your
warm
heart
your
pure
eyes
your
rich
spirit
reach
your
hand
to
us
help
us
out
of
this
pool
of
grief
and
misery
into
which
the
selfishness
of
men
has
plunged
us
and
holds
us
fast
help
us
to
overcome
the
relentless
egoism
of
man
that
demon
which
for
centuries
has
held
the
woman
lashed
imprisoned
so
that
accustomed
as
she
is
to
ill
treatment
she
sees
no
injustice
but
submits
with
stoicism
to
what
seems
the
good
right
of
the
man
and
an
inheritance
of
sorrow
to
every
woman
i
am
still
young
but
i
am
not
deaf
nor
blind
and
i
have
heard
and
seen
much
too
much
it
may
he
so
that
my
heart
is
drawn
with
pain
and
i
am
swept
violently
forward
in
opposition
to
those
customs
and
conventions
which
are
the
curse
of
women
and
children
helpless
in
bitter
grief
i
wring
my
hands
and
feel
myself
powerless
to
fight
against
an
evil
so
gigantic
and
which
o
cruelty
is
under
the
protection
of
the
mohammedan
law
and
is
fed
by
the
ignorance
of
the
women
themselves
the
victims
of
the
sacrifice
fate
allows
that
cruel
wrong
which
is
called
polygamy
to
stalk
abroad
in
the
land
i
will
not
have
it
cries
the
mouth
vehemently
and
the
heart
echoes
the
cry
a
thousand
fold
but
alas
to
will
have
we
human
beings
a
will
it
is
always
we
must
do
everything
from
our
first
infant
cry
till
our
last
breath
life
is
full
of
dark
riddles
and
of
secrets
we
think
that
we
know
so
much
and
all
the
time
we
know
nothing
we
think
that
we
have
a
will
an
iron
will
and
picture
ourselves
strong
enough
to
move
mountains
then
a
burning
tear
a
sorrowful
look
from
eyes
that
we
love
and
our
strength
is
gone
let
me
tell
you
a
story
that
is
neither
amusing
nor
interesting
but
dull
monotonous
and
long
drawn
out
and
which
will
demand
much
patience
first
i
ask
your
forgiveness
humbly
for
the
weary
hour
i
am
going
to
cause
you
it
is
the
history
of
three
brown
girls
children
of
the
sunny
east
born
blind
but
whose
eyes
have
been
opened
so
that
they
can
see
the
beautiful
noble
things
in
life
and
now
that
their
eyes
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
light
now
that
they
have
learned
to
love
the
sun
and
everything
that
is
in
the
brilliant
world
they
are
about
to
have
the
blinders
pressed
back
against
their
eyes
and
to
be
plunged
into
the
darkness
from
which
they
had
come
and
in
which
each
and
every
one
of
their
grandmothers
back
through
the
ages
had
lived
it
is
said
that
books
full
of
nonsense
came
from
the
distant
west
and
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
binnenland
that
quiet
peaceful
place
on
java
ever
green
coast
where
the
sisters
dwelt
that
these
rebellious
ones
were
unwilling
to
bear
the
yoke
which
had
been
borne
meekly
and
patiently
by
all
women
before
them
and
which
now
hangs
suspended
above
them
so
that
any
second
it
may
be
dropped
upon
their
unwilling
shoulders
people
are
wrong
it
is
not
only
the
books
that
have
made
them
rebellious
conditions
have
done
that
conditions
that
have
existed
from
time
immemorial
and
which
are
a
curse
a
curse
to
every
one
who
happens
to
be
born
a
woman
or
a
girl
already
in
her
earliest
youth
when
emancipation
was
for
her
an
unknown
word
and
when
books
and
other
writings
which
spoke
of
it
were
far
beyond
her
reach
in
one
of
the
three
sisters
was
born
the
desire
to
open
the
door
of
life
it
was
recreation
hour
at
the
european
school
at
japara
under
the
yellow
blossoming
waroe
trees
in
the
schoolyard
big
and
little
girls
were
grouped
in
happy
disorder
it
was
so
warm
that
no
one
cared
to
play
shut
your
book
letsy
i
have
something
to
tell
you
pleaded
a
brown
girl
whose
costume
and
headdress
betrayed
the
javanese
a
great
blond
girl
who
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
reading
eagerly
in
a
book
turned
around
and
said
no
i
have
to
study
my
french
lesson
you
can
do
that
at
home
for
it
is
not
school
work
yes
but
if
i
do
not
learn
my
french
lessons
well
i
shall
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
holland
year
after
next
and
i
am
so
anxious
to
go
there
to
study
at
the
normal
school
when
i
come
back
later
as
a
teacher
perhaps
i
shall
be
placed
here
and
then
i
shall
sit
on
the
platform
before
the
class
as
our
teacher
does
now
but
tell
me
ni
you
have
never
yet
said
what
you
were
going
to
be
when
you
grew
up
two
large
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
speaker
in
astonishment
only
tell
me
the
javanese
shook
her
head
and
said
laconically
i
do
not
know
no
truly
she
did
not
know
she
had
never
thought
of
it
she
was
still
so
young
still
so
full
of
joyous
young
life
but
the
question
of
her
little
white
friend
made
a
deep
impression
upon
her
it
would
not
let
her
rest
incessantly
she
seemed
to
hear
sounding
in
her
ears
the
words
what
are
you
going
to
be
when
you
grow
up
that
day
she
did
much
task
work
in
school
she
was
so
gave
the
most
foolish
answers
when
she
was
asked
a
question
and
made
the
silliest
mistakes
in
her
work
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
for
her
thoughts
were
not
on
her
lessons
she
was
thinking
of
what
she
had
heard
in
the
recreation
hour
the
first
thing
that
she
did
when
she
got
home
was
to
run
to
her
father
and
lay
the
problem
before
him
what
am
i
going
to
be
when
i
grow
up
he
said
nothing
but
smiled
and
pinched
her
cheek
but
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
put
off
and
waited
teasing
him
for
an
answer
at
last
an
older
brother
came
in
and
answered
the
question
her
greedy
listening
ears
heard
these
words
what
should
a
girl
become
why
a
a
javanese
married
woman
of
high
rank
naturally
the
little
girl
was
satisfied
with
the
answer
and
went
quickly
and
happily
away
a
she
repeated
several
times
to
herself
what
is
a
the
idea
was
with
her
always
she
thought
constantly
of
the
two
words
she
must
later
become
such
an
one
she
looked
around
her
saw
and
came
in
contact
with
many
regarded
them
attentively
studied
them
and
what
she
learned
as
much
as
a
child
could
understand
of
the
lives
of
these
women
caused
the
spirit
of
opposition
to
awaken
in
her
heart
against
this
being
a
the
ancient
rule
that
girls
must
marry
must
belong
to
a
man
without
being
asked
when
who
or
how
this
little
girl
reached
the
age
of
twelve
and
a
half
and
it
was
time
that
she
should
say
farewell
to
her
merry
childish
life
and
take
leave
of
the
upon
which
she
had
been
so
glad
to
sit
and
of
the
little
european
companions
among
whom
she
had
studied
so
willingly
she
was
old
enough
to
come
home
according
to
the
custom
of
her
country
it
demands
that
a
young
girl
remain
in
the
house
and
be
rigidly
secluded
from
the
outside
world
until
that
time
when
the
man
for
whom
god
has
created
her
shall
come
and
take
her
to
his
dwelling
she
knew
all
too
well
that
with
the
school
door
much
that
was
unutterably
dear
would
be
closed
to
her
for
ever
the
parting
from
the
dear
teacher
who
bade
her
farewell
with
such
sympathetic
cordial
words
counseling
resignation
and
from
little
companions
who
with
tears
in
their
eyes
pressed
her
hand
it
was
hard
but
it
was
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
giving
up
of
her
lessons
the
ending
of
her
studies
she
was
so
bent
upon
learning
and
she
knew
that
there
was
much
more
yet
to
be
studied
before
one
can
even
go
through
the
lower
school
she
was
ambitious
and
she
did
not
wish
to
stand
below
her
little
white
friends
most
of
whom
were
going
to
europe
later
or
her
brothers
who
went
to
the
high
school
she
implored
her
father
to
allow
her
to
go
to
the
high
school
at
semarang
with
the
boys
she
would
do
her
best
her
parents
would
never
have
to
complain
of
her
she
crouched
on
her
knees
before
him
her
pleading
hands
resting
upon
his
lap
her
great
child
eyes
were
raised
up
to
him
full
of
longing
and
in
breathless
suspense
and
anguish
she
waited
for
his
answer
caressingly
he
stroked
the
dark
little
head
his
fingers
pushed
back
tenderly
the
rebellious
locks
from
her
forehead
and
softly
and
yet
firmly
the
word
no
came
from
his
lips
she
sprang
up
she
knew
what
no
from
him
meant
she
went
away
and
crept
under
the
bed
to
hide
herself
she
wished
to
be
alone
with
her
grief
once
her
teacher
had
asked
her
if
she
could
not
go
to
holland
to
study
with
letsy
his
daughter
who
was
her
friend
she
listened
eagerly
and
with
shining
eyes
would
you
not
like
to
go
do
not
ask
me
if
i
would
like
to
go
ask
me
if
i
may
came
hoarsely
from
her
trembling
lips
good
man
he
had
meant
to
be
so
kind
to
her
stranger
that
he
was
to
native
customs
he
did
not
know
how
cruel
his
question
was
it
was
putting
dainties
before
the
eyes
of
one
starving
for
bread
foolish
girl
it
was
never
the
intention
of
your
good
parents
to
send
you
to
school
to
raise
rebellious
thoughts
in
your
heart
you
were
to
learn
dutch
and
dutch
manners
nothing
more
stupid
little
thing
if
that
had
been
all
you
had
learned
so
much
misery
in
the
future
would
have
been
spared
you
but
the
stupid
little
thing
had
not
made
herself
she
could
help
it
if
god
had
given
her
a
sensitive
soul
and
a
heart
which
readily
absorbed
all
that
the
dutch
language
had
helped
her
to
think
beautiful
poor
little
one
in
her
heart
western
thoughts
found
a
joyous
entrance
yet
she
saw
herself
fettered
hand
and
foot
by
eastern
tradition
and
her
muscles
were
still
too
weak
too
soft
to
enable
her
to
break
the
chains
which
bound
her
and
later
when
she
found
herself
strong
so
that
with
a
single
jerk
they
could
be
wrenched
asunder
did
she
do
it
but
we
will
not
run
ahead
with
the
story
we
have
not
gone
very
far
as
yet
the
school
door
lay
behind
her
and
the
house
of
her
parents
welcomed
her
to
herself
great
was
that
house
and
spacious
were
the
grounds
but
high
and
thick
were
the
walls
that
surrounded
them
and
the
closed
in
four
cornered
space
was
henceforth
to
be
her
world
her
all
never
mind
how
spacious
and
handsome
even
comfortable
a
cage
may
be
it
is
still
a
cage
to
the
little
bird
that
is
imprisoned
there
gone
gone
was
her
merry
childhood
gone
everything
that
made
her
young
life
happy
she
still
felt
herself
such
a
child
and
she
was
that
in
fact
too
but
the
law
placed
her
inexorably
among
the
full
grown
and
she
to
whom
no
ditch
was
too
broad
to
be
leapt
no
tree
too
high
to
be
climbed
who
loved
nothing
so
much
as
to
run
like
a
wild
colt
in
the
meadows
must
now
be
calm
composed
and
grave
as
beseemed
a
javanese
young
lady
of
a
high
and
noble
house
the
ideal
javanese
girl
is
silent
and
expressionless
as
a
wooden
doll
speaking
only
when
it
is
necessary
and
then
with
a
little
whispering
voice
which
can
hardly
be
heard
by
an
ant
she
must
walk
foot
before
foot
and
slowly
like
a
snail
laugh
silently
without
opening
her
lips
it
is
unseemly
for
the
teeth
to
show
that
is
to
be
like
a
clown
ni
sinned
every
second
a
dull
monotonous
slow
mode
of
life
began
for
her
day
after
day
passed
wearily
away
amid
the
same
occupations
and
the
same
people
sometimes
there
would
be
a
bright
spot
in
those
first
dark
days
a
visit
from
letsy
it
was
like
a
holiday
when
letsy
was
with
her
she
became
as
of
old
the
merry
child
and
forgot
that
she
was
a
prisoner
but
she
suffered
doubly
for
the
temporary
forgetfulness
after
the
little
white
friend
had
gone
the
slow
moving
life
went
on
more
stupid
more
monotonous
she
watched
her
younger
sisters
with
hungry
longing
every
time
that
they
went
out
of
the
door
armed
with
their
to
go
to
the
temple
of
wisdom
where
knowledge
was
to
be
found
for
a
time
she
tried
to
study
her
lessons
by
herself
but
it
seemed
useless
a
pupil
alone
without
a
master
soon
grows
discouraged
with
a
deep
sigh
she
hid
her
books
away
if
pillows
and
cushions
could
but
speak
what
would
they
not
be
able
to
tell
they
could
tell
of
the
misery
of
a
little
human
soul
that
with
scalding
tears
cried
herself
to
sleep
on
their
bosom
night
after
night
young
people
can
not
learn
to
be
resigned
in
their
silly
little
heads
and
hearts
dwell
a
hundred
wild
restless
and
rebellious
thoughts
they
feel
themselves
so
alone
and
draw
back
timidly
from
those
with
whom
they
live
day
in
and
day
out
it
is
very
easy
to
live
for
years
with
one
brothers
and
sisters
and
to
remain
always
as
strangers
ni
had
an
older
sister
who
shared
her
imprisonment
she
was
fond
of
her
but
there
was
no
confidence
between
them
they
differed
too
much
both
in
character
and
point
of
view
the
older
sister
was
quiet
conventional
calm
and
composed
and
the
younger
one
was
just
the
opposite
all
life
and
fire
by
nature
her
ideas
were
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
who
believed
firmly
in
all
the
old
traditions
and
customs
often
the
younger
sister
had
gone
with
shining
eyes
to
tell
of
something
which
filled
her
brimful
of
enthusiasm
and
when
she
had
finished
the
older
sister
would
answer
coldly
go
your
own
way
as
for
me
i
am
a
javanese
ni
heart
would
stand
still
within
her
as
though
touched
by
a
rough
hand
she
would
grow
icy
cold
the
younger
sisters
too
were
estranged
from
her
the
older
one
was
not
pleased
when
they
were
with
ni
ni
who
had
such
strange
ideas
and
sister
was
very
strong
the
little
sisters
were
afraid
of
her
ni
found
it
hard
but
not
so
hard
as
to
feel
that
her
own
mother
was
opposed
to
her
she
too
closed
her
heart
to
her
because
her
ideas
were
diametrically
opposed
to
her
own
poor
little
ni
her
small
soul
was
longing
for
tenderness
and
she
found
only
coldness
where
on
her
side
she
gave
love
she
received
at
best
tolerance
why
was
she
always
so
strange
so
peculiar
so
different
ah
she
had
tried
so
often
to
be
like
others
to
think
like
others
yet
always
when
she
was
almost
happy
something
would
happen
that
would
make
the
slumbering
thoughts
burst
forth
tumultuously
and
reproach
her
for
her
seeming
forgetfulness
so
that
she
would
hold
to
them
all
the
more
firmly
still
her
life
was
not
so
wholly
colourless
and
dull
there
were
two
who
held
to
her
who
loved
her
just
as
she
was
she
felt
their
love
warming
her
inmost
being
and
clung
to
them
with
all
the
tenderness
of
her
thirsting
heart
they
were
her
father
and
her
third
brother
the
youngest
of
her
older
brothers
it
is
true
that
they
could
not
satisfy
her
most
intimate
and
dearest
wish
to
be
free
could
never
gratify
her
longing
to
study
but
her
dear
father
was
always
so
good
to
his
little
daughter
his
own
silly
girl
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
she
felt
it
he
would
look
at
her
tenderly
his
gentle
hands
would
stroke
her
cheeks
her
hair
and
his
strong
arms
would
go
so
protectingly
around
her
and
she
knew
that
brother
loved
her
too
although
he
had
never
told
her
so
had
never
spoken
a
loving
word
to
her
had
never
caressed
her
but
a
thousand
little
delicate
attentions
of
which
only
a
loving
heart
could
think
spoke
constantly
of
his
warm
affection
for
her
he
never
laughed
at
her
when
she
told
him
her
thoughts
never
made
her
shiver
with
a
cold
go
your
own
way
as
for
me
i
am
a
javanese
and
although
he
never
told
her
that
he
sympathized
with
her
ideals
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
he
was
as
one
with
her
she
knew
that
he
was
only
silent
because
he
did
not
wish
to
make
her
more
rebellious
the
books
which
he
placed
in
her
hands
showed
her
that
ni
felt
so
rich
with
the
love
of
her
two
dear
ones
and
with
the
sympathy
of
her
brother
but
her
father
was
not
always
with
her
he
had
his
work
to
do
and
where
he
worked
she
might
not
go
she
must
never
go
out
of
the
place
which
was
her
dwelling
and
her
brother
was
at
home
only
once
in
the
year
for
he
went
to
school
in
semarang
her
oldest
brother
came
home
he
had
obtained
an
appointment
in
the
neighbourhood
and
lived
with
his
parents
if
ni
had
suffered
before
his
coming
from
the
coolness
of
nearly
all
those
who
lived
in
the
house
with
her
from
their
indifference
to
all
that
interested
her
from
her
imprisonment
there
now
began
a
series
of
teasings
and
tormentings
which
added
a
thousand
times
to
her
distress
ni
was
wild
she
could
not
dance
to
the
piping
of
her
brother
young
people
should
be
submissive
and
obey
their
elders
was
constantly
preached
to
her
and
above
all
girls
must
be
submissive
to
their
older
brothers
but
headstrong
ni
could
not
see
why
this
should
be
she
could
not
help
it
that
she
should
have
been
born
later
than
her
brother
that
was
no
reason
why
she
should
be
submissive
to
him
she
was
not
answerable
to
any
one
only
to
her
own
conscience
and
her
own
heart
she
would
never
give
in
to
her
brother
except
when
she
was
convinced
that
he
was
right
at
first
he
was
astonished
and
later
he
grew
angry
when
he
saw
that
a
little
girl
who
was
half
a
dozen
years
younger
than
he
dared
to
defy
his
will
she
must
be
forcibly
suppressed
everything
was
wrong
that
ni
did
she
was
severely
reprimanded
for
each
little
fault
no
day
passed
that
brother
and
sister
did
not
stand
facing
each
other
in
anger
he
with
a
dark
countenance
and
stern
words
that
made
her
heart
bleed
and
she
with
quivering
lips
tremblingly
defending
her
good
right
to
do
something
which
he
wished
to
forbid
she
was
entirely
alone
in
her
fight
against
the
despotism
of
her
brother
her
future
protector
whenever
she
should
have
the
misfortune
to
lose
her
parents
until
she
should
leave
his
roof
under
the
protection
of
the
man
for
whom
god
had
created
her
he
took
very
good
care
not
to
torment
her
when
her
father
was
there
father
would
never
have
allowed
it
and
he
knew
well
that
she
was
too
proud
to
tell
but
the
others
who
lived
in
the
house
were
silent
too
although
they
knew
that
she
was
within
her
rights
it
would
not
do
to
allow
impertinence
and
the
girl
was
impertinent
young
as
she
was
she
dared
to
say
no
to
the
yes
of
her
so
much
older
brother
a
girl
had
no
right
to
do
anything
which
would
even
partially
detract
from
the
importance
of
a
man
it
was
not
right
for
this
girl
to
oppose
her
ideas
to
those
of
her
brother
in
later
years
when
ni
remembered
all
this
she
could
understand
very
well
why
the
man
was
so
egotistical
always
by
every
one
in
the
house
he
was
taught
as
a
child
to
be
selfish
by
his
mother
most
of
all
from
childhood
he
was
taught
to
regard
the
girl
the
woman
as
a
creature
of
a
lower
order
than
himself
had
she
not
often
heard
his
mother
his
aunts
and
all
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
say
to
him
in
scornful
disdainful
tones
a
girl
is
only
a
girl
it
is
through
woman
herself
that
man
first
learns
to
scorn
woman
ni
blood
boiled
whenever
she
heard
deprecating
words
about
girls
spoken
by
a
woman
women
are
nothing
women
are
created
for
men
for
their
pleasure
they
can
do
with
them
as
they
will
sounded
brutally
in
her
ears
and
irritating
as
the
laugh
of
satan
her
eyes
shot
fire
her
fists
clenched
and
she
pressed
her
lips
tightly
together
in
impotent
distress
no
no
cried
her
fast
beating
little
heart
we
are
human
just
as
much
as
men
oh
let
me
learn
loose
my
bonds
only
give
me
the
chance
and
i
will
show
that
i
am
a
human
being
a
woman
just
as
good
as
a
man
she
writhed
and
twisted
but
the
chains
were
strong
and
locked
tightly
around
her
tender
wrists
and
ankles
she
wounded
herself
but
she
did
not
break
them
too
early
ripened
child
at
an
age
when
a
young
head
should
only
be
filled
with
dreams
of
merry
play
she
was
busy
with
sombre
dark
thoughts
about
the
sad
things
in
life
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
she
was
not
deaf
nor
blind
and
lived
in
the
midst
of
a
civilization
which
took
no
account
of
youth
and
sensitive
feelings
roughly
the
young
tender
eyes
were
opened
to
the
realities
of
life
in
all
their
coarseness
ugliness
and
cruelty
from
her
parents
themselves
she
never
heard
a
harsh
word
that
would
have
shocked
her
pure
mind
or
wounded
her
sensitive
heart
but
she
did
not
live
only
with
her
parents
o
death
why
are
you
called
terrible
you
who
release
mankind
from
this
cruel
life
ni
would
have
followed
you
thankfully
and
with
joy
she
had
no
one
to
show
her
what
was
lofty
and
beautiful
in
life
and
that
everything
was
not
low
and
vile
ni
loved
her
father
with
her
whole
soul
and
although
she
lived
constantly
with
her
parents
she
could
never
lay
her
inmost
thoughts
before
them
coldly
the
strong
javanese
etiquette
stood
between
them
ni
avoided
as
much
as
she
could
those
people
who
with
their
cynicism
had
withered
her
and
while
the
manners
and
customs
of
her
country
did
not
allow
her
stricken
little
soul
to
seek
refuge
in
her
parents
arms
and
on
her
parents
hearts
she
found
comfort
in
those
quiet
silent
friends
books
she
had
always
been
fond
of
reading
but
now
her
love
for
reading
became
a
passion
as
soon
as
she
had
time
when
all
her
little
duties
were
done
she
would
seize
a
book
or
a
paper
she
read
everything
that
came
into
her
hands
she
greedily
devoured
both
the
green
and
the
ripe
once
she
threw
a
book
away
which
was
full
of
horrors
she
did
not
have
to
look
into
books
when
she
wished
to
know
of
loathsome
nauseating
things
real
life
was
full
of
them
it
was
to
escape
from
them
that
she
buried
her
soul
in
realms
which
the
genius
of
man
has
fashioned
out
of
the
spirit
of
fantasy
there
were
so
many
beautiful
books
which
gave
her
unspeakable
pleasure
and
which
she
will
never
be
able
to
forget
stories
of
strong
characters
nobly
laying
hold
on
life
of
great
souls
and
spirits
which
would
make
her
heart
glow
with
enthusiasm
and
delight
she
lived
in
everything
that
she
read
while
she
was
reading
there
was
nothing
more
for
which
she
wished
she
was
lost
her
father
took
great
pleasure
in
her
love
of
reading
and
showered
her
with
presents
of
books
she
did
not
understand
everything
that
she
read
but
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
discouraged
by
that
what
she
could
not
understand
in
the
first
reading
became
in
the
second
less
obscure
and
at
the
third
or
fourth
it
would
be
quite
clear
every
unknown
word
that
she
found
she
noted
down
and
later
when
her
dearest
brother
came
home
she
would
ask
him
its
meaning
and
he
helped
his
little
sister
so
willingly
and
lovingly
if
she
had
not
had
her
loving
father
her
dear
brother
and
her
books
she
could
not
have
lived
through
the
sorrowful
years
father
and
brother
stilled
the
yearning
for
love
and
affection
and
the
books
gave
to
her
hungry
spirit
food
a
little
brother
was
born
and
this
helpless
baby
held
ni
back
from
misfortune
he
brought
her
again
into
the
good
path
from
which
she
had
begun
to
wander
she
was
fast
becoming
a
bad
child
toward
her
mother
she
had
closed
her
heart
more
and
more
toward
her
and
the
little
brother
made
the
doors
of
that
heart
spring
wide
open
again
little
brother
taught
her
what
a
mother
is
and
what
a
child
owes
to
its
mother
mother
had
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
and
looked
weak
and
worn
out
and
little
brother
had
done
that
little
brother
who
would
not
let
her
rest
but
called
her
every
night
again
and
again
never
mind
how
wearisome
the
heavy
burden
might
be
there
was
never
a
single
expression
of
impatience
on
mother
face
whenever
little
brother
cried
for
her
in
a
second
she
was
by
him
she
would
take
him
up
and
never
lay
him
out
of
her
arms
till
he
was
in
a
sweet
sleep
had
mother
held
her
too
and
never
put
her
down
till
she
was
sound
asleep
the
around
ni
heart
melted
and
it
beat
warmly
once
more
toward
the
woman
who
had
given
her
life
brother
was
a
healthy
child
during
his
first
year
but
when
he
was
weaned
and
for
three
years
after
that
the
little
one
was
sick
as
though
he
kept
wrestling
with
death
and
by
his
sick
bed
ni
the
young
child
learned
to
understand
her
mother
she
saw
her
own
shortcomings
she
was
too
selfish
she
was
always
thinking
of
her
own
troubles
and
never
thought
that
others
could
have
troubles
and
that
she
could
have
a
share
in
causing
them
she
had
once
been
always
with
mother
as
little
brother
was
now
she
could
do
nothing
without
mother
mother
must
have
suffered
and
perhaps
did
even
now
well
she
could
not
help
it
if
she
thought
differently
from
her
mother
but
she
could
be
very
careful
to
do
nothing
that
would
cause
her
pain
little
brother
taught
her
consideration
how
to
see
the
other
side
of
things
he
taught
her
submission
and
gratitude
and
to
give
without
asking
anything
in
return
four
years
went
by
calm
and
quiet
on
the
surface
but
to
those
who
could
see
below
it
full
of
strife
for
ni
she
learned
much
in
those
years
submission
not
always
to
think
first
of
herself
but
peace
and
acquiescence
she
had
not
learned
could
never
learn
her
head
was
haunted
by
turbulent
thoughts
voices
too
still
came
to
her
from
the
distant
west
in
books
newspapers
and
magazines
and
in
letters
from
dutch
friends
for
a
year
her
sisters
and
she
had
every
day
an
hour
lesson
in
handiwork
from
a
dutch
lady
these
were
pleasant
hours
for
ni
because
then
she
could
speak
dutch
the
language
which
she
loved
so
much
her
oldest
brother
meanwhile
was
given
a
position
at
a
distance
and
ni
was
ashamed
that
she
should
be
so
very
glad
he
was
still
her
brother
although
he
had
not
loved
her
time
and
separation
work
wonders
they
took
away
all
resentment
from
ni
heart
and
she
grew
to
love
her
brother
she
felt
sorry
for
the
great
boy
who
had
allowed
himself
to
be
deceived
by
the
silly
flattery
of
fawning
men
it
comforted
her
to
think
that
toward
the
last
she
had
noticed
a
change
in
his
conduct
toward
her
he
said
nothing
in
words
but
his
actions
spoke
of
his
sorrow
for
his
former
injustice
and
ni
thanked
god
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
her
brother
was
beginning
to
be
fond
of
her
she
who
had
been
formerly
disliked
and
hated
was
now
first
she
was
always
with
him
and
he
would
do
more
for
her
than
for
any
one
else
a
half
year
before
a
younger
sister
had
come
to
share
the
imprisonment
bemi
was
fortunate
at
an
age
when
ni
had
already
been
for
a
long
time
safely
immured
behind
high
thick
walls
she
could
run
freely
around
go
on
little
journeys
and
do
many
other
things
that
were
forbidden
to
ni
bemi
was
fourteen
and
a
half
years
of
age
when
she
came
home
to
stay
ni
was
now
sixteen
the
oldest
sister
married
and
with
the
wedding
celebration
changes
came
into
her
own
life
ni
learned
to
know
her
sisters
who
up
to
this
time
had
lived
near
her
but
as
strangers
there
could
never
have
been
very
much
confidence
between
her
older
sister
and
herself
she
was
only
an
older
sister
and
ni
did
not
wish
to
be
so
regarded
by
the
younger
ones
she
wished
to
be
loved
and
not
feared
freedom
and
equality
were
what
she
asked
for
herself
ought
she
not
to
begin
by
giving
them
to
others
the
intercourse
between
the
younger
sisters
and
herself
must
be
free
and
unrestrained
away
with
everything
that
would
hinder
it
with
bemi
and
wi
a
little
sister
who
had
meanwhile
come
to
the
house
ni
took
sister
room
and
the
three
lives
that
had
hitherto
been
strange
to
one
another
met
flowed
together
and
became
as
one
to
mevrouw
o
the
inward
pain
of
caring
for
nothing
we
must
have
something
work
that
will
take
entire
possession
of
us
and
leave
no
time
for
torturing
thoughts
that
is
the
only
thing
that
can
awaken
our
slumbering
souls
and
give
us
back
our
strength
of
spirit
work
that
is
just
it
the
longing
for
work
that
we
will
love
is
what
presses
upon
us
so
heavily
it
is
frightful
to
feel
the
power
to
work
and
the
will
to
work
and
yet
be
condemned
to
idleness
we
will
not
believe
that
our
whole
lives
to
the
very
end
will
be
monotonous
dull
and
commonplace
and
yet
we
see
no
chance
for
a
single
one
of
all
our
beautiful
dreams
to
ever
become
a
reality
we
do
not
know
clearly
what
we
shall
do
but
we
are
determined
to
follow
only
the
voices
of
our
own
hearts
if
we
had
been
boys
our
father
could
have
brought
us
up
to
be
fine
fellows
we
hear
till
we
are
weary
when
it
is
certainly
true
that
if
the
same
material
is
in
us
out
of
which
fine
boys
could
be
made
the
same
trouble
could
just
as
easily
make
fine
women
of
us
is
it
only
fine
men
that
have
been
of
use
hitherto
and
are
fine
women
of
no
value
to
civilization
but
we
javanese
women
must
first
of
all
be
gentle
and
submissive
we
must
be
as
clay
which
one
can
mould
into
any
form
that
he
wishes
but
why
speak
of
this
now
it
is
as
though
men
on
a
sinking
ship
complained
because
they
had
not
remained
at
home
investigated
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
and
punished
those
responsible
for
it
that
would
not
prevent
the
ship
from
going
down
they
would
be
drowned
just
the
same
and
only
the
courage
of
the
hand
at
the
rudder
and
pumping
at
the
leak
could
have
saved
them
from
destruction
x
august
your
encouragement
is
a
support
it
strengthens
me
i
will
i
shall
obtain
my
freedom
i
will
stella
i
will
do
you
understand
that
but
how
shall
i
be
able
to
win
it
if
i
do
not
strive
how
shall
i
be
able
to
find
it
if
i
do
not
seek
without
strife
there
can
be
no
victory
i
shall
strive
and
i
shall
win
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
burdens
and
difficulties
i
feel
strong
enough
to
overcome
them
but
there
is
one
thing
i
am
afraid
to
face
squarely
stella
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
love
father
dearly
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
have
the
courage
to
carry
my
will
through
if
it
would
break
his
heart
which
is
full
of
love
for
us
i
love
him
unspeakably
my
old
grey
father
old
and
grey
through
care
for
us
for
me
and
if
one
of
us
should
be
condemned
to
unhappiness
let
me
be
the
one
here
lurks
egoism
for
i
could
never
be
happy
even
if
i
had
freedom
even
if
i
gained
my
independence
if
in
attaining
them
i
had
made
father
miserable
in
thinking
over
javanese
and
european
conditions
and
comparing
them
with
one
another
one
can
easily
see
that
it
is
hardly
better
there
than
here
in
so
far
as
the
morality
of
the
men
is
concerned
and
that
women
are
unfortunate
there
as
here
with
this
difference
however
that
the
great
majority
there
of
their
own
free
will
follow
the
man
in
the
marriage
bond
while
here
the
women
have
no
say
at
all
in
the
matter
but
are
simply
married
out
of
hand
according
to
the
will
of
their
parents
to
whomsoever
those
powerful
ones
shall
find
good
in
the
mohammedan
world
the
approval
yes
even
the
presence
of
the
woman
is
not
necessary
at
a
marriage
father
can
come
home
any
day
at
all
and
say
to
me
you
are
married
to
so
and
so
i
must
then
follow
my
husband
it
is
true
i
can
refuse
but
that
gives
the
man
the
right
to
chain
me
to
him
for
my
whole
life
without
ever
having
come
near
me
i
am
his
wife
although
i
will
not
follow
him
and
if
he
will
not
allow
me
to
be
divorced
then
i
am
bound
to
him
all
my
life
while
he
is
free
to
do
as
he
pleases
he
may
marry
as
many
women
as
he
chooses
without
being
concerned
in
the
least
about
me
if
father
should
marry
me
off
in
this
manner
then
i
should
find
a
way
out
at
the
beginning
one
way
or
another
but
then
father
would
never
do
that
god
has
created
woman
as
the
companion
of
man
and
the
calling
of
woman
is
marriage
good
it
is
not
to
be
denied
and
i
gladly
acknowledge
that
the
highest
happiness
for
a
woman
is
and
shall
be
centuries
after
us
a
harmonious
union
with
the
man
of
her
choice
but
how
can
one
speak
of
a
harmonious
union
as
our
marriage
laws
are
now
i
have
tried
to
picture
them
to
you
must
i
not
for
myself
hate
the
idea
of
marriage
scorn
it
when
by
it
the
woman
is
so
cruelly
wronged
no
fortunately
every
mohammedan
has
not
four
wives
or
more
but
every
married
woman
in
our
world
knows
that
she
is
not
the
only
one
and
that
any
day
the
man
fancy
can
bring
a
companion
home
who
will
have
just
as
much
right
to
him
as
she
according
to
the
mohammedan
law
she
is
also
his
wife
in
the
government
countries
the
women
have
not
such
a
hard
time
as
their
sisters
in
those
ruled
by
the
princes
as
in
soerakarta
and
djokjakarta
here
the
women
are
fortunate
with
only
one
two
three
or
four
there
in
the
princes
countries
the
women
would
call
that
child
play
one
finds
there
hardly
a
single
man
with
but
one
wife
among
the
nobility
especially
in
the
circle
surrounding
the
emperor
the
men
have
usually
women
shall
these
conditions
endure
stella
our
people
have
grown
so
accustomed
to
them
and
moreover
they
see
no
other
way
in
which
every
woman
would
be
provided
for
but
in
her
heart
almost
every
woman
that
i
know
curses
this
right
of
the
man
but
curses
never
help
something
must
be
done
come
women
girls
stand
up
let
us
reach
our
hands
to
one
another
and
let
us
work
together
to
change
this
unbearable
situation
yes
stella
i
know
it
in
europe
too
the
state
of
morality
among
men
is
tragic
i
say
with
you
teach
the
young
men
to
turn
their
backs
upon
temptation
and
deplorable
customs
and
to
feel
disgraced
at
the
existence
of
those
girls
who
follow
men
not
ignorantly
into
the
places
where
life
is
sordid
yes
certainly
the
young
mothers
could
do
most
there
i
have
already
maintained
that
to
my
sisters
i
should
so
love
to
have
children
boys
and
girls
to
nourish
and
to
form
after
my
own
heart
but
above
all
things
i
should
never
follow
the
unhappy
custom
of
putting
boys
before
girls
we
have
no
right
to
be
surprised
at
the
egoism
of
men
when
we
consider
how
as
children
they
are
placed
above
the
girls
their
sisters
even
as
a
child
a
man
is
taught
to
despise
girls
have
i
not
many
times
heard
mothers
say
to
their
boys
when
they
would
fall
and
cry
fie
a
boy
cry
just
like
a
girl
i
should
teach
my
children
boys
and
girls
to
regard
one
another
as
equal
human
beings
and
give
them
always
the
same
education
of
course
following
the
natural
disposition
of
each
i
should
not
allow
my
girl
although
i
wished
to
make
a
new
woman
of
her
to
study
as
though
she
had
no
other
desire
in
life
nor
would
i
cut
her
off
in
anything
so
that
her
brother
could
have
more
never
and
then
i
should
let
down
the
bars
which
have
been
so
foolishly
erected
between
the
two
sexes
i
am
convinced
that
when
this
is
done
much
good
will
come
of
it
especially
to
the
men
i
shall
never
believe
that
educated
and
cultivated
men
designedly
avoid
the
society
of
women
who
are
their
equals
in
education
and
enlightenment
to
throw
themselves
deliberately
into
the
arms
of
disreputable
women
while
many
men
seek
the
society
where
cultivated
ladies
are
to
be
found
there
is
a
vast
army
who
can
not
take
the
slightest
interest
in
a
girl
without
thinking
of
sex
now
all
this
will
disappear
when
men
and
women
can
mingle
freely
together
from
childhood
you
say
we
girls
could
do
much
toward
bringing
young
men
upon
the
good
path
but
we
know
so
little
of
their
lives
everything
will
change
with
time
but
here
in
java
we
stand
only
on
the
threshold
of
the
new
age
must
we
not
go
through
all
the
corresponding
stages
of
development
through
which
you
have
already
passed
in
europe
among
my
new
treasures
i
have
het
jongetje
by
borel
a
delightful
book
many
here
think
it
sickly
and
but
to
me
it
is
sickly
not
at
all
and
even
less
there
may
not
be
many
like
little
boy
but
i
know
at
least
one
the
child
of
the
is
borel
boy
personified
once
he
said
to
kardinah
tante
i
like
girls
so
much
girls
smile
so
indolently
they
are
quite
quite
different
from
boys
they
are
so
sweet
so
soft
a
little
fellow
of
five
said
this
he
bit
kardinah
arm
once
saying
tante
why
are
women
so
soft
then
he
bit
his
own
arm
and
said
though
i
am
so
little
yet
i
am
a
man
that
is
the
reason
i
am
hard
he
is
such
a
lovely
child
with
great
dreamy
eyes
and
brown
curling
hair
before
he
came
here
he
made
our
acquaintance
at
soerabaja
through
our
portraits
his
mother
told
him
that
they
were
going
to
the
place
where
his
dear
aunts
lived
the
child
thought
that
he
must
marry
and
asked
maatje
must
i
marry
all
three
or
only
one
of
them
when
he
came
here
and
saw
us
his
mother
said
to
him
well
little
brother
have
you
chosen
which
one
of
the
aunts
you
will
marry
maatje
i
can
not
choose
for
i
love
all
three
just
the
same
the
dear
little
angel
then
turned
to
each
one
of
us
and
said
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
yes
i
love
the
whole
world
for
everything
is
good
everything
is
beautiful
if
this
had
been
told
me
by
some
one
else
i
should
not
have
believed
it
but
i
saw
and
heard
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
ears
the
subject
which
mevrouw
van
wishes
to
have
treated
is
the
the
life
of
the
native
woman
on
that
i
had
rather
not
write
just
yet
i
have
far
too
much
to
say
and
could
not
possibly
make
an
orderly
whole
of
it
now
in
a
few
years
perhaps
when
i
shall
have
learned
more
i
shall
undertake
it
now
the
thoughts
blow
and
whirl
through
my
brain
like
falling
leaves
that
are
driven
by
the
wind
what
a
comparison
eh
the
mornings
are
magnificent
now
and
so
are
the
evenings
but
in
the
middle
of
the
day
i
should
like
to
do
nothing
but
lie
in
the
water
if
that
were
not
so
warm
we
enjoy
the
mornings
so
much
nature
is
then
splendidly
fresh
and
beautiful
we
wander
around
the
garden
where
everything
is
blooming
and
fragrant
it
is
truly
a
pleasure
to
be
out
of
doors
in
the
morning
if
you
could
only
wander
around
with
us
or
do
you
not
care
for
flowers
and
plants
mother
has
her
vegetable
garden
and
we
our
flower
and
rose
garden
this
last
is
next
to
our
room
and
when
there
is
a
full
moon
it
is
so
idyllic
out
there
the
sisters
bring
their
guitars
and
sit
under
the
flowering
shrubs
and
make
music
after
the
concert
we
sit
idly
sometimes
chattering
and
laughing
your
indignation
over
the
treatment
which
my
two
educated
and
enlightened
fellow
countrymen
had
to
endure
did
me
good
but
believe
me
they
are
not
all
stupid
men
who
conduct
themselves
so
scornfully
toward
the
javanese
i
have
met
persons
who
are
far
from
stupid
who
even
belong
to
the
aristocracy
of
the
mind
but
are
so
haughty
and
that
they
do
not
like
to
be
in
the
same
house
with
me
too
often
we
are
made
to
feel
that
we
javanese
are
not
really
human
beings
at
all
how
do
the
netherlanders
expect
to
be
loved
by
us
when
they
treat
us
so
love
begets
love
but
scorn
never
yet
aroused
affection
we
have
many
friends
among
the
hollanders
whom
we
love
dearly
even
more
than
we
do
friends
of
our
own
race
they
have
taken
the
trouble
to
try
and
understand
us
and
they
have
won
our
love
we
shall
never
forget
that
we
have
to
thank
the
hollanders
for
the
awakening
of
our
minds
for
our
civilization
they
may
wrong
us
but
we
will
like
them
because
we
owe
them
so
much
people
may
say
of
the
javanese
what
they
will
but
they
can
never
say
with
truth
that
they
have
not
hearts
they
have
them
manifestly
and
they
know
how
to
be
grateful
for
benefits
whether
they
are
of
a
material
or
of
an
intellectual
kind
although
their
immovable
countenances
change
not
one
jot
to
betray
their
inward
emotion
but
i
shall
never
have
to
tell
you
i
am
sure
that
all
creatures
of
whatever
colour
are
human
beings
just
as
much
as
you
yourself
i
am
happy
because
i
have
been
able
to
know
you
i
shall
not
let
you
go
stella
i
love
you
so
much
that
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
my
life
if
as
god
forbid
we
should
ever
become
separated
as
though
the
wide
ocean
were
not
already
between
us
but
spirits
among
whom
there
is
great
sympathy
know
no
distance
they
bridge
the
widest
seas
and
most
lands
to
commune
with
one
another
letters
too
are
splendid
blessed
be
he
who
first
invented
them
a
week
ago
we
had
a
visit
from
the
director
of
education
service
and
industry
and
his
wife
from
batavia
and
stella
rejoice
with
me
the
director
came
here
especially
to
see
father
and
to
ask
his
advice
personally
about
the
erection
of
the
native
school
for
girls
which
the
government
is
planning
i
was
sick
and
miserable
not
only
from
bodily
pain
but
misery
of
soul
but
stella
i
believed
that
my
dream
of
freedom
was
on
the
point
of
realization
when
father
gave
me
the
director
letter
that
letter
cured
me
entirely
it
did
me
such
infinite
good
to
know
that
in
batavia
one
of
the
highest
officials
of
the
government
had
a
heart
for
the
javanese
and
for
the
javanese
woman
soon
afterwards
mama
came
to
look
for
me
and
she
found
her
daughter
in
tears
i
was
so
happy
so
thankful
before
he
came
i
had
the
greatest
desire
to
see
him
alone
if
only
for
a
moment
just
to
express
something
of
what
i
felt
and
he
came
but
not
alone
his
wife
was
with
him
o
stella
never
in
our
lives
have
we
made
such
a
charming
acquaintance
i
had
already
great
sympathy
for
him
because
i
knew
why
he
was
coming
and
the
sympathy
grew
when
i
saw
him
ride
into
our
grounds
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
with
his
wife
on
the
back
seat
and
next
to
her
father
who
had
met
them
at
the
station
i
knew
that
father
would
never
have
sat
there
without
being
pressed
you
would
have
seen
nothing
remarkable
in
this
and
you
will
laugh
at
me
when
i
say
that
it
impressed
me
very
much
because
it
spoke
of
the
modesty
of
the
director
and
told
me
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
all
the
airs
and
painful
respect
which
so
many
officials
here
demand
i
was
accustomed
to
seeing
father
on
the
left
side
of
resident
or
assistant
resident
never
mind
how
much
younger
the
latter
might
be
but
not
only
i
europeans
even
are
seriously
annoyed
by
the
silly
regulations
of
rank
here
the
newly
arrived
european
officials
and
the
regents
take
their
places
upon
chairs
while
the
cold
ground
covered
and
sometimes
uncovered
with
a
bamboo
mat
is
good
enough
for
a
native
wedono
who
has
grown
grey
in
the
service
the
most
petty
european
sits
upon
a
chair
while
native
officials
of
any
age
who
are
below
the
rank
of
regent
though
they
are
often
of
distinguished
ancestry
must
sit
upon
the
floor
in
their
presence
it
certainly
does
not
please
the
heart
to
see
a
grey
wedono
creep
upon
the
ground
before
a
young
aspirant
a
youth
who
may
have
just
left
the
school
benches
but
enough
of
that
it
was
only
to
explain
why
the
courtesy
of
the
director
a
man
of
such
high
authority
struck
me
so
forcibly
we
heard
the
director
say
to
father
i
have
been
all
over
java
and
have
talked
with
many
chiefs
regent
you
have
set
the
example
by
sending
your
girls
to
school
i
have
asked
girls
who
were
going
to
the
grammar
schools
if
they
would
like
to
go
on
with
their
studies
and
they
have
all
answered
enthusiastically
yes
he
asked
father
where
he
thought
the
girls
school
ought
to
be
erected
whether
in
west
middle
or
east
java
o
stella
how
my
ears
and
eyes
tingled
and
my
heart
beat
with
joy
to
hear
that
at
last
we
are
to
have
light
in
our
poor
dark
woman
world
while
mijnheer
talked
to
father
mevrouw
talked
to
us
we
drew
near
to
her
with
such
pleasure
she
told
me
of
the
plan
of
her
husband
and
asked
what
i
thought
of
it
a
splendid
idea
mevrouw
which
will
be
a
blessing
to
the
native
women
but
it
would
be
a
still
greater
blessing
if
the
girls
were
also
given
an
opportunity
to
learn
a
vocation
that
would
place
them
in
a
position
to
make
their
own
way
in
life
if
after
receiving
an
education
they
should
feel
reluctant
to
go
back
into
their
old
environment
and
the
woman
whose
spirit
has
been
awakened
whose
outlook
has
been
broadened
might
not
be
able
to
live
again
in
the
world
of
her
ancestors
she
will
have
been
taught
what
freedom
means
and
then
shut
up
in
a
dungeon
taught
to
fly
and
then
imprisoned
in
a
cage
no
no
the
truly
enlightened
woman
could
not
possibly
feel
happy
in
our
native
environment
not
as
long
as
it
remains
as
it
is
there
is
only
one
road
in
life
open
for
the
native
girl
and
that
is
and
what
marriage
means
among
our
people
can
not
be
unknown
to
you
who
have
been
so
long
in
java
oh
we
think
it
is
splendid
that
your
husband
wishes
to
give
girls
advantages
and
education
but
let
that
last
be
also
a
vocational
education
and
then
your
husband
will
truly
have
showered
blessings
upon
our
native
world
do
you
hear
that
she
said
enthusiastically
to
her
husband
this
young
lady
asks
vocational
training
for
native
girls
astonished
he
turned
to
me
and
said
really
do
you
ask
vocational
training
for
girls
how
would
you
arrange
it
but
tell
us
what
you
would
like
to
be
yourself
i
felt
all
eyes
fastened
upon
me
those
of
my
parents
burned
into
my
face
i
cast
down
my
own
eyes
there
was
a
buzzing
and
roaring
in
my
ears
but
above
it
i
seemed
to
hear
the
words
kartini
be
brave
do
not
waver
but
tell
me
what
do
you
wish
to
be
i
know
you
wish
to
become
a
writer
but
you
do
not
have
to
be
educated
especially
for
that
you
can
become
that
by
yourself
alas
for
study
i
am
too
late
but
at
least
i
may
raise
my
eyes
on
high
and
go
humbly
and
quietly
forward
mevrouw
spoke
to
me
for
a
long
time
about
what
you
and
i
have
discussed
so
often
woman
when
we
bade
each
other
and
were
going
to
bed
she
took
my
hands
in
both
of
hers
pressed
them
warmly
and
said
little
friend
we
shall
discuss
this
again
some
time
meanwhile
i
shall
write
to
you
often
will
you
do
the
same
to
me
the
following
morning
we
went
with
her
part
of
the
way
and
during
the
three
hours
that
we
sat
with
her
in
the
carriage
she
and
i
told
each
other
so
much
although
it
was
twelve
when
we
separated
the
evening
before
she
had
told
her
husband
everything
that
she
had
learned
from
us
o
regent
she
cried
again
and
again
give
me
one
of
your
daughters
let
her
come
to
batavia
with
me
do
let
this
young
lady
come
to
visit
me
i
shall
come
and
fetch
her
myself
father
told
her
that
he
thought
of
going
to
batavia
this
year
but
they
must
remain
at
home
with
mama
mevrouw
with
that
she
appeared
overcome
with
distress
was
it
earnest
or
a
jest
they
wish
us
to
come
to
batavia
to
plead
our
cause
and
the
cause
of
the
native
woman
in
person
before
the
high
authorities
oh
stella
pray
that
if
it
should
come
to
pass
i
shall
be
able
to
plead
well
at
parting
she
said
to
me
be
brave
have
faith
and
courage
this
can
not
last
for
ever
some
way
will
be
found
be
brave
stella
am
i
dreaming
or
waking
is
there
a
happy
future
for
us
is
it
possible
to
hope
that
our
dream
is
coming
true
she
has
told
me
more
but
i
dare
not
tell
you
now
it
is
still
so
far
away
but
it
shines
and
beams
before
me
like
a
star
of
hope
later
stella
dear
when
i
have
it
in
my
arms
and
hold
it
tight
so
that
it
can
not
slip
away
you
shall
know
what
it
is
i
have
asked
my
sisters
if
i
were
really
alive
i
felt
so
unspeakably
happy
pray
for
me
dearest
that
this
may
be
no
illusion
no
empty
mirage
that
would
be
terrible
when
the
director
saw
our
work
painting
embossing
he
asked
if
it
would
not
be
possible
in
a
year
time
for
us
to
have
an
exhibition
he
was
sorry
that
we
had
not
sent
more
to
the
french
exposition
the
next
morning
he
said
that
he
would
speak
to
influential
people
at
batavia
and
see
if
an
exposition
of
native
work
could
not
be
arranged
there
for
next
year
you
must
send
a
great
deal
of
what
you
have
shown
us
o
stella
i
could
not
speak
i
turned
to
him
and
to
her
with
tears
in
my
eyes
we
felt
as
though
we
were
in
a
dream
there
was
no
yesterday
no
tomorrow
for
us
only
the
joyous
splendid
day
existed
it
made
me
dizzy
made
me
afraid
what
if
these
dreams
and
illusions
should
vanish
like
smoke
when
i
came
home
i
took
up
my
pen
at
once
to
write
to
our
friend
mevrouw
ovink
a
few
days
ago
i
sent
her
a
cry
of
despair
and
my
dear
moedertje
must
know
that
her
daughter
is
happy
again
i
have
told
her
nothing
of
what
i
have
written
here
for
you
alone
i
have
only
told
her
that
i
felt
happy
and
full
of
the
joy
of
life
but
i
have
told
you
everything
with
just
one
exception
although
you
have
a
right
to
that
too
for
you
have
comforted
me
when
i
was
in
despair
your
enthusiasm
has
given
me
strength
when
i
was
weak
stella
if
i
can
ever
do
anything
for
my
sisters
in
java
it
will
be
solely
and
only
because
of
you
i
told
you
that
mevrouw
ter
horst
invited
me
to
write
for
her
paper
on
the
condition
of
the
native
woman
she
believed
that
i
was
too
reserved
and
suggested
a
form
herself
under
which
i
could
treat
the
subject
a
talk
between
two
regents
daughters
she
on
her
part
will
do
everything
to
further
the
good
cause
i
have
father
permission
stella
so
much
lies
under
my
hand
god
grant
that
i
can
bring
it
to
maturity
all
too
often
i
write
sketchy
commonplace
things
taken
from
our
own
lives
one
of
them
appeared
in
the
echo
as
pseudonym
i
chose
tiga
soedara
the
three
sisters
although
we
three
are
one
soon
the
identity
of
tiga
soedara
was
discovered
and
there
was
a
notice
about
my
work
in
the
a
daily
paper
here
in
india
i
found
it
tiresome
i
should
gladly
have
kept
my
writing
secret
i
do
not
like
to
be
discussed
it
may
sound
ungracious
but
truly
i
did
not
deserve
so
many
compliments
still
that
notice
in
the
paper
had
its
good
side
too
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
for
the
next
month
two
numbers
of
a
new
newspaper
for
natives
were
sent
to
father
with
the
request
that
they
be
given
to
us
and
also
a
letter
came
asking
for
the
of
tiga
soedara
this
is
the
first
netherland
newspaper
that
has
been
founded
for
natives
and
i
expect
many
blessings
for
my
people
through
the
dutch
language
it
is
like
our
lilies
dutch
flowers
which
bloom
in
added
fragrance
and
beauty
when
they
are
transplanted
to
distant
india
the
is
now
the
you
can
easily
imagine
that
i
wrote
an
enthusiastic
letter
to
its
editor
and
founder
director
of
the
high
school
at
probolingo
placing
my
services
at
his
disposal
and
soon
a
letter
came
from
him
with
a
list
of
subjects
which
he
would
like
to
have
treated
by
me
the
first
was
native
education
for
girls
after
that
a
native
institute
and
javanese
art
kartini
never
say
i
can
not
but
i
will
i
will
stella
i
will
i
hope
fervently
that
you
have
not
my
strength
i
shall
do
my
best
now
i
shall
tell
you
something
else
we
three
have
begun
to
study
french
out
of
the
little
books
of
servaas
de
bruijn
we
have
wrestled
through
most
of
the
four
volumes
and
we
now
want
you
to
recommend
to
us
some
simple
easy
french
books
not
school
books
father
has
also
given
us
a
german
grammar
when
we
get
through
with
our
french
studies
and
have
german
under
our
thumbs
we
hope
to
begin
english
if
we
live
long
enough
we
try
now
to
read
french
illustrated
papers
but
reading
and
understanding
are
two
different
things
is
it
not
true
in
the
beginning
we
made
the
stupidest
mistakes
but
we
have
improved
slowly
and
we
feel
in
fine
good
humour
roekmini
declared
once
that
she
had
dreamed
in
french
she
was
with
chateaubriand
and
in
louisiana
the
beautiful
country
of
which
he
wrote
the
french
language
has
many
resemblances
to
ours
and
the
h
is
exactly
like
ours
our
new
friend
said
to
her
husband
they
are
anxious
to
learn
languages
how
glad
i
should
be
to
teach
them
myself
yesterday
i
received
a
letter
from
her
it
was
twenty
pages
long
she
wrote
so
affectionately
and
said
that
she
felt
that
she
would
see
us
again
trust
to
the
future
she
wrote
and
i
will
trust
so
long
as
i
know
that
i
have
you
and
her
on
my
side
her
letter
made
me
ashamed
just
as
yours
do
you
and
she
think
too
well
of
me
and
yet
stella
life
is
so
full
of
riddles
and
of
secrets
human
beings
are
subject
to
change
and
it
is
not
always
from
feeble
character
circumstances
can
come
into
life
which
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
will
turn
a
hero
into
a
coward
do
not
judge
any
deed
never
mind
how
base
it
may
appear
till
you
know
all
the
causes
which
lead
to
it
i
have
experienced
much
in
these
last
days
many
different
emotions
first
i
was
almost
in
despair
because
my
dream
of
freedom
seemed
to
lie
deeply
buried
in
the
ground
then
the
friends
from
batavia
came
and
such
happiness
came
over
me
that
it
overwhelmed
me
i
was
as
though
intoxicated
and
then
i
was
frightened
and
awakened
by
a
pain
so
heavy
that
i
thought
i
should
not
be
able
to
breathe
that
was
not
on
account
of
myself
but
of
another
whom
i
love
with
my
whole
soul
why
must
happiness
and
misery
follow
one
another
so
quickly
poor
dear
father
he
has
suffered
so
much
and
life
still
brings
him
new
disappointments
stella
my
father
has
no
one
but
his
children
we
are
his
joy
his
consolation
his
all
i
love
my
freedom
the
idea
is
always
with
me
and
the
fate
of
my
sisters
goes
to
my
heart
i
would
be
ready
for
any
sacrifice
by
which
good
could
come
to
them
i
should
only
look
on
it
as
happiness
the
greatest
happiness
that
could
ever
come
to
me
in
life
but
my
father
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
these
put
together
stella
call
me
a
coward
call
me
weak
for
i
can
not
be
anything
else
if
father
is
set
against
this
dedication
of
myself
never
mind
how
my
heart
may
cry
out
i
shall
hold
it
still
i
have
not
the
courage
to
wound
that
true
heart
that
beats
so
warmly
for
me
and
to
make
it
bleed
again
for
it
has
bled
all
too
much
already
and
i
myself
have
not
been
altogether
without
guilt
you
say
that
you
can
not
understand
why
every
one
must
marry
you
say
to
oppose
that
must
with
will
as
for
me
i
should
certainly
say
it
in
so
far
as
others
are
concerned
but
never
in
opposition
to
father
especially
now
that
i
know
what
heavy
grief
oppresses
him
whatever
i
shall
have
to
do
will
not
be
looked
upon
as
compulsory
because
of
a
must
but
as
something
which
i
freely
take
upon
myself
for
his
sake
i
write
paint
and
do
everything
because
father
takes
pleasure
in
it
i
shall
work
hard
and
try
my
best
to
do
something
good
so
that
he
may
be
proud
of
me
you
may
call
me
foolish
morbid
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
should
be
miserable
if
father
should
set
himself
against
my
plan
of
freedom
but
i
should
be
still
more
miserable
if
my
dearest
wishes
should
be
fulfilled
and
at
the
same
time
i
should
lose
father
love
but
i
shall
never
lose
that
i
will
not
believe
it
possible
though
i
could
break
his
heart
from
any
one
he
could
endure
disappointment
better
than
from
me
because
perhaps
he
loves
me
a
little
more
than
the
others
and
i
love
him

dearly

it
would
not
be
possible
for
me
to
take
such
a
step
now
after
twenty
years
it
will
be
different
now
it
would
never
do
there
would
be
too
many
trials
and
difficulties
to
be
overcome
because
i
should
be
the
first
father
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
but
sprang
up
and
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
father
said
that
he
must
first
think
about
this
earnestly
and
speak
with
others
and
ask
their
advice
at
least
father
did
not
wholly
reject
my
idea
for
father
knows
that
i
wish
to
become
at
any
price
free
independent
and
unshackled
and
that
i
could
never
be
happy
in
a
married
life
as
marriages
are
now
and
have
always
been
then
i
asked
if
the
native
girls
school
of
abendanon
should
materialize
may
i
not
become
a
teacher
and
i
told
him
what
mevrouw
abendanon
had
proposed
to
me
moedertje
it
was
as
though
the
doors
of
heaven
had
sprung
open
and
an
eternal
splendour
blazed
before
my
eyes
when
i
heard
father
say
that
is
good
that
is
a
splendid
idea
you
could
do
that
very
well
but
first
i
should
have
to
be
trained
for
the
position
i
should
have
to
go
to
school
for
a
year
or
so
and
study
to
be
able
to
pass
the
examination
because
i
would
not
undertake
the
work
unless
i
were
fitted
for
it
and
father
thought
i
was
right
and
agreed
with
me
i
was
unspeakably
happy
i
had
never
thought
that
it
would
be
so
easy
not
a
single
bitter
sharp
word
had
been
spoken
i
felt
as
though
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
my
heart
father
had
been
so
tender
so
loving
then
i
had
not
been
mistaken
in
my
faith
in
his
love
for
me
in
my
belief
in
his
sympathy
for
his
child
i
knew
that
father
would
suffer
more
than
i
if
he
should
cause
me
misery
and
that
he
hoped
even
as
fervently
as
i
that
a
way
might
be
found
for
me
it
was
because
of
him
that
i
felt
so
miserable
for
months
that
i
was
so
vacillating
weak
and
cowardly
because
i
could
not
bear
to
hurt
him
and
i
felt
that
i
must
for
i
could
not
debase
myself
or
allow
my
woman
heart
my
dignity
as
a
woman
as
a
human
being
to
be
trampled
upon
i
would
have
set
myself
against
my
parents
i
was
morally
bound
by
my
own
pride
and
my
duty
to
myself
not
to
submit
in
silence
the
inward
strife
has
been
terrible
and
now
i
have
won
father
over
to
my
side
with
that
the
greatest
difficulty
is
overcome
the
greatest
stumbling
block
cleared
from
the
way
i
can
go
forward
now
to
meet
the
enemy
unafraid
gay
and
with
a
smile
on
my
face
now
everything
depends
upon
myself
alone
it
will
be
the
fault
of
my
own
will
if
by
any
chance
i
shall
fail
to
reach
my
goal
but
i
am
full
of
hope
and
courage
i
have
already
asked
father
if
i
may
tell
the
good
news
to
mevrouw
abendanon
and
i
may
this
very
evening
i
am
writing
to
you
and
to
her
it
is
still
doubtful
whether
the
native
girls
school
will
come
into
existence
but
i
never
despair
it
will
be
accomplished
one
way
or
another
for
there
are
some
though
not
many
it
is
true
who
are
striving
to
help
our
native
world
and
to
bring
light
to
the
native
woman
at
djokja
we
went
to
see
mevrouw
ter
horst
as
i
have
already
written
you
she
was
very
cordial
to
us
and
went
to
the
station
to
meet
us
where
however
she
missed
us
for
we
got
off
a
station
further
on
she
had
a
table
already
spread
for
us
when
we
arrived
we
went
to
see
her
because
she
had
something
to
talk
about
with
me
she
told
me
that
the
plans
of
resident
de
of
which
we
had
known
nothing
differed
from
those
of
abendanon
his
idea
was
to
build
a
domestic
school
for
daughters
of
native
chiefs
with
the
help
if
possible
if
not
by
some
other
means
the
resident
had
asked
her
to
sketch
out
a
plan
the
details
of
which
he
would
fill
in
she
now
asked
for
my
ideas
and
what
i
thought
the
native
girls
daughters
of
chiefs
high
and
low
should
be
taught
if
the
endeavour
of
abendanon
to
found
a
native
girls
school
should
fail
which
heaven
forbid
and
i
should
not
become
a
teacher
after
all
then
you
will
not
desert
me
moedertje
will
you
but
you
will
try
to
help
me
to
obtain
father
permission
to
study
medicine
may
i
not
have
that
assurance
from
you
and
your
husband
too
you
could
do
so
much
because
you
have
great
influence
with
father
since
that
memorable
noonday
talk
father
has
been
so
affectionate
to
me
he
takes
my
hand
between
his
two
hands
tenderly
and
puts
his
arm
around
me
so
lovingly
as
though
he
would
protect
me
from
some
impending
danger
through
everything
i
feel
his
immeasurable
love
and
it
makes
me
very
happy
since
we
have
come
back
from
batavia
we
have
a
queer
feeling
as
though
we
had
only
come
home
to
rest
until
evening
to
say
good
day
and
then
to
fly
away
again
whither
i
shall
enjoy
being
at
home
now
to
the
utmost
for
nowhere
in
the
whole
world
will
it
be
as
pleasant
to
me
as
in
my
own
parents
house
and
i
am
so
thankful
because
whenever
be
it
today
or
tomorrow
i
shall
leave
that
house
it
will
be
with
their
blessing
and
i
hope
also
from
my
heart
with
the
blessing
of
its
other
inmates
too
as
a
child
i
could
learn
with
a
fair
amount
of
ease
i
was
never
backward
but
between
then
and
now
lies
a
whole
lifetime
everything
that
i
learned
at
the
grammar
school
i
have
forgotten
i
was
twelve
and
a
half
years
of
age
when
i
left
it
but
one
can
almost
always
accomplish
what
one
wishes
to
very
hard
is
it
not
true
moedertje
i
have
written
this
confession
with
the
full
conviction
the
firm
trust
that
no
one
can
take
a
warmer
interest
in
my
plans
than
you
and
mijnheer
and
what
i
have
just
related
concerns
my
whole
future
i
know
that
i
can
go
to
you
at
any
time
when
i
need
advice
support
and
comfort
in
the
time
to
come
i
shall
certainly
go
to
you
many
times
to
mevrouw
xii
october
i
calmly
bide
my
time
when
it
comes
then
men
shall
see
that
i
am
no
soulless
creature
but
a
human
being
with
a
head
and
a
heart
who
can
think
and
feel
it
is
frightfully
egotistical
of
me
to
make
you
a
sharer
in
every
thing
that
concerns
me
it
brings
light
to
me
but
to
you
it
must
be
vexation
everything
for
myself
nothing
for
you
i
long
to
tell
you
everything
simply
because
i
love
you
so
much
draw
back
from
me
thrust
me
from
your
thoughts
from
your
heart
forget
me
let
me
struggle
alone
for
o
god
you
do
not
know
into
what
a
wasps
nest
you
stick
your
hand
when
you
reach
it
out
to
me
let
me
alone
i
shall
only
be
thankful
for
your
sympathy
and
because
you
have
crossed
the
path
of
my
life
and
caused
sunshine
and
flowers
to
fall
across
it
let
our
meeting
be
as
that
of
ships
on
the
wide
ocean
that
pass
in
the
dark
night
a
meeting
a
blithe
greeting
a
foamy
track
through
the
smooth
water
and
then
no
more
but
i
fear
i
know
that
you
could
never
go
by
like
that
even
though
you
might
wish
it
let
us
never
speak
of
it
again
a
little
while
ago
in
talking
to
mama
about
something
of
interest
to
women
i
told
her
what
i
had
said
so
many
times
before
that
nothing
attracted
me
more
that
nothing
was
more
longed
for
by
me
than
to
be
able
to
fly
alone
upon
my
own
wings
mama
said
but
there
is
no
one
now
not
among
us
who
does
that
then
it
is
time
that
some
one
should
do
it
but
you
know
very
well
that
every
beginning
is
difficult
that
the
fate
of
every
innovator
is
hard
that
misunderstanding
disappointment
on
top
of
disappointment
ridicule
all
await
you
do
you
realize
that
i
know
it
but
it
is
not
today
nor
yesterday
that
these
ideas
have
come
to
me
they
have
lived
in
me
for
years
but
what
will
come
of
it
for
yourself
will
it
bring
you
contentment
make
you
happy
i
know
that
the
way
i
wish
to
go
is
difficult
full
of
thorns
thistles
pitfalls
it
is
stormy
rough
slippery
and
it
is
free
and
even
though
i
shall
not
be
happy
after
i
have
reached
my
goal
though
i
may
give
way
before
it
is
half
reached
i
shall
die
gladly
for
the
path
will
then
have
been
broken
and
i
shall
have
helped
to
clear
the
way
which
leads
to
freedom
and
independence
for
the
native
woman
i
shall
feel
a
great
content
because
the
parents
of
other
girls
who
wished
to
become
independent
would
never
be
able
to
say
is
no
one
not
among
us
who
does
that
strange
but
i
am
not
uneasy
or
disturbed
i
am
calm
and
full
of
courage
only
my
stupid
foolish
heart
feels
sick
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xiii
i
wish
to
prepare
myself
to
teach
the
two
grades
lower
and
higher
and
also
to
take
courses
in
hygiene
bandaging
and
the
care
of
the
sick
later
i
should
like
to
take
a
language
course
first
to
learn
thoroughly
my
own
mother
tongue
i
want
to
go
on
with
my
studies
in
holland
because
holland
seems
to
me
in
all
respects
a
more
suitable
place
of
preparation
for
the
great
task
which
i
would
undertake
how
shall
we
greet
each
other
when
we
meet
at
last
i
know
exactly
what
you
will
say
to
me
at
first
but
child
how
stout
you
have
grown
and
i
shall
whisper
between
two
hugs
i
have
grown
old
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
but
that
little
spot
in
my
heart
where
love
is
written
in
golden
letters
remains
the
same
for
ever
young
to
mevrouw
xiv
january
new
conditions
will
come
into
the
javanese
world
if
not
through
us
through
others
who
will
come
after
us
emancipation
is
in
the
air
it
has
been
foreordained
and
she
whose
destiny
it
is
to
be
the
spiritual
mother
of
the
new
age
must
suffer
it
is
the
eternal
law
of
nature
those
who
bear
must
feel
the
pain
of
bearing
but
the
child
has
all
our
love
though
its
very
existence
above
that
of
all
others
living
has
harassed
us
though
it
has
been
received
through
suffering
it
is
eternally
precious
to
us
nothing
is
more
miserable
than
to
feel
the
power
to
work
within
one
and
yet
to
be
condemned
to
idleness
thank
god
this
curse
has
been
taken
from
me
a
short
while
ago
a
professor
from
jena
anton
with
his
wife
was
here
with
us
he
was
travelling
in
pursuance
of
his
studies
they
came
here
to
make
our
acquaintance
i
am
afraid
that
people
see
too
much
in
me
i
am
certain
that
they
allow
themselves
to
be
misled
through
the
charm
of
novelty
and
perhaps
also
through
sympathy
we
are
a
novelty
to
many
people
especially
to
those
from
a
distance
to
whom
everything
that
is
new
is
more
or
less
attractive
the
professor
expected
us
to
be
half
savage
and
found
us
quite
like
ordinary
people
the
strangeness
was
all
in
our
headdress
clothes
and
surroundings
and
these
merely
gave
to
the
common
place
a
stamp
of
individuality
is
it
not
pleasant
to
find
one
own
thoughts
reflected
in
another
and
when
the
other
is
a
stranger
some
one
of
another
race
from
another
part
of
the
world
of
different
blood
manners
and
customs
it
but
adds
to
the
charm
of
kinship
of
soul
still
i
am
convinced
that
not
a
quarter
so
much
notice
would
have
been
taken
of
us
if
we
had
worn
petticoats
instead
of
sarong
and
kabaja
had
dutch
manners
and
if
european
instead
of
javanese
blood
had
flowed
through
our
veins
our
friends
made
us
a
present
of
several
books
among
them
that
splendid
work
by
baroness
von
suttner
de
wapens
neer
gelegd
lay
down
your
arms
i
have
read
several
other
books
among
which
moderne
maagden
impressed
me
most
because
i
had
found
in
it
much
that
i
myself
had
thought
and
experienced
marcel
prévost
has
spoken
the
truth
and
knows
how
to
express
his
ideas
i
think
his
book
very
beautiful
nowhere
have
i
seen
the
aim
of
the
woman
movement
expressed
with
so
much
truth
and
power
still
i
am
just
as
far
from
the
solution
of
that
great
problem
as
i
was
before
making
the
acquaintance
of
i
do
not
take
it
amiss
that
the
writer
and
this
not
in
a
spirit
of
childish
mockery
represents
all
opponents
of
the
woman
movement
with
the
exception
of
fedi
and
lea
as
absolutely
base
and
detestable
what
splendid
words
he
puts
into
the
mouth
of
the
lovable
and
deformed
apostle
of
feminism
piruet
at
the
end
of
the
which
express
clearly
the
whole
aim
of
the
woman
movement
i
have
taken
a
double
pleasure
in
this
book
because
a
man
thought
of
it
and
wrote
it
just
before
i
read
moderne
maagden
i
wrote
long
letters
to
my
two
best
friends
here
now
i
want
to
write
to
them
again
while
i
am
still
under
its
influence
i
want
to
point
out
the
analogies
between
much
that
is
in
the
book
and
both
the
intimate
letters
dutch
version
of
les
vierges
fortes
by
marcel
prévost
i
wish
that
i
had
some
one
here
to
talk
to
me
about
there
is
so
much
in
it
that
i
should
like
to
discuss
with
some
one
of
experience
and
understanding
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
about
the
establishment
of
schools
for
native
girls
it
is
now
generally
discussed
but
i
must
be
brief
today
the
plan
of
abendanon
was
looked
upon
with
interest
by
every
one
many
influential
european
officials
gave
it
their
warm
support
and
it
is
upon
them
its
success
depends
we
have
many
friends
among
the
high
european
officials
and
these
are
striving
with
abendanon
to
lift
our
native
women
out
of
their
misery
there
are
also
many
unknown
to
us
personally
who
are
deeply
interested
in
the
cause
i
shall
send
you
a
circular
by
abendanon
addressed
to
the
heads
of
the
provincial
government
concerning
the
establishment
of
these
schools
in
all
ages
the
progress
of
woman
has
been
an
important
factor
in
the
civilization
of
a
people
the
intellectual
education
of
the
javanese
people
can
never
progress
if
the
woman
is
to
be
left
behind
the
woman
as
the
carrier
of
civilization
stella
does
not
your
heart
beat
warmly
for
our
friend
for
the
last
year
there
has
been
great
progress
among
the
natives
they
are
growing
more
earnest
and
are
interested
in
the
study
of
your
beautiful
language
many
europeans
see
this
with
regretful
eyes
although
there
are
others
who
are
and
rejoice
in
many
cities
small
dutch
schools
have
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
and
they
are
filled
with
little
children
as
well
as
with
grown
men
who
have
been
for
years
in
the
service
of
the
state
influential
men
in
the
government
with
the
at
their
head
are
strongly
in
favour
of
spreading
the
dutch
language
among
the
natives
not
only
for
enlightenment
but
as
a
means
of
bringing
the
javanese
nearer
to
the
hollanders
so
that
these
last
may
seem
not
as
strangers
but
as
loved
protectors

xv
january
we
went
at
midday
to
the
shore
with
mevrouw
conggrijp
to
bathe
it
was
splendidly
calm
and
the
sea
was
all
one
colour
i
sat
on
a
rock
with
my
feet
in
the
water
and
my
eyes
on
the
distant
horizon
oh
the
world
is
so
beautiful
thanksgiving
and
peace
were
in
my
heart
if
we
go
to
mother
nature
for
consolation
she
will
not
allow
us
to
go
away
uncomforted
i
have
thought
so
long
and
so
much
about
education
especially
of
late
and
i
think
it
such
a
high
holy
task
that
i
feel
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
dedicate
myself
to
it
and
not
be
able
to
fill
in
my
account
to
the
utmost
if
i
thought
otherwise
i
should
be
a
teacher
without
worth
education
means
the
forming
of
the
mind
and
of
the
soul
i
feel
that
with
the
education
of
the
mind
the
task
of
the
teacher
is
not
complete
the
duty
of
forming
the
character
is
his
it
is
not
included
in
the
letter
of
the
law
but
it
is
a
moral
duty
i
ask
myself
if
i
am
able
to
do
this
i
who
am
still
so
uneducated
myself
i
often
hear
it
asserted
that
when
the
mind
is
cultivated
the
spirit
grows
of
itself
but
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
that
that
is
not
always
the
case
that
education
and
intellect
are
not
always
a
patent
of
morality
but
one
must
not
judge
those
whose
spirits
remain
unawakened
who
lack
the
higher
education
of
the
soul
too
harshly
in
most
cases
the
fault
lies
not
in
themselves
but
in
their
bringing
up
great
care
has
been
taken
in
the
cultivation
of
the
understanding
but
in
the
cultivation
of
the
character
none
i
subscribe
warmly
to
mijnheer
idea
which
is
set
forth
so
clearly
in
his
paper
on
the
education
of
native
girls
woman
as
the
carrier
of
civilization
not
because
she
has
always
shared
the
fate
of
man
and
is
a
partner
in
his
destiny
but
because
as
i
too
am
firmly
convinced
she
has
a
great
and
influence
which
can
be
for
either
good
or
evil
and
because
she
most
of
all
can
help
toward
the
spiritual
regeneration
of
the
world
man
receives
from
woman
his
very
earliest
nourishment
at
her
breast
the
child
learns
to
feel
to
think
and
to
speak
and
i
see
more
and
more
clearly
that
the
very
earliest
education
has
an
influence
which
extends
over
one
whole
after
life
but
how
can
the
native
women
teach
their
children
when
they
themselves
are
so
ignorant
there
is
great
interest
in
education
in
the
whole
world
of
native
women
so
far
as
we
know
it
many
wish
that
they
might
be
children
again
so
that
they
might
profit
by
this
opportunity
and
splendid
the
number
of
native
scholars
at
parti
kodoes
japara
and
the
other
districts
are
the
first
visible
foreshadowings
of
success
already
there
are
some
schools
among
the
people
and
their
number
is
increasing
tomorrow
my
mother
will
send
a
little
girl
half
orphan
and
child
of
her
anek
mas
to
school
and
last
month
our
parents
sent
a
good
studious
boy
to
learn
to
read
in
dutch
to
mevrouw
abendanon
foster
nurse
xvi
january
i
turn
my
face
pensively
to
the
far
away
staring
into
the
blue
light
as
though
i
expected
to
find
there
an
answer
to
the
tumultuous
questions
of
my
soul
my
eyes
follow
the
clouds
as
they
journey
through
the
vast
heavens
till
they
disappear
behind
the
waving
green
leaves
of
the
cocoanut
trees
i
see
the
glistening
leaves
painted
with
the
gold
of
the
sun
and
suddenly
the
thought
comes
ask
them
why
does
the
sun
shine
what
sends
his
rays
o
my
sun
my
golden
sun
i
shall
strive
to
live
so
that
i
may
be
worthy
to
be
shone
upon
and
tended
and
warmed
by
your
light
do
not
be
distressed
dear
if
things
do
not
go
as
i
would
have
them
my
life
shall
not
have
been
in
vain
there
is
always
something
to
be
done
i
will
have
it
so
those
who
seek
god
do
not
live
in
vain
and
whosoever
seeketh
after
god
will
find
happiness
truth
and
peace
of
soul
and
these
are
to
be
found
at
modjowarno
as
well
who
knows
perhaps
there
sooner
than
somewhere
else
never
be
discouraged
never
be
dismayed
we
are
only
thankful
that
in
any
event
a
beginning
has
been
made
that
the
foundations
of
our
freedom
and
independence
are
being
built
to
mevrouw
abendanon
in
the
residency
of
soerabaja
the
most
important
as
well
as
the
oldest
mission
station
in
java
it
includes
schools
and
hospitals
a
medical
missionary
at
modjowarno
had
offered
to
train
kartini
as
a
if
her
plan
of
going
to
holland
should
fail
xvii
march
highly
honoured
adriani
for
a
long
time
i
have
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
several
things
among
them
the
indisposition
of
almost
all
of
my
family
have
prevented
me
now
that
the
whole
kaboepaten
great
and
small
is
again
rejoicing
in
excellent
health
i
shall
not
allow
this
letter
to
remain
any
longer
unwritten
it
has
been
in
my
thoughts
so
long
and
doubtless
you
have
expected
it
as
well
forgive
me
for
the
delay
first
of
all
i
want
to
send
my
hearty
thanks
for
your
amiable
letter
to
my
sister
roekmini
and
for
your
kindness
in
sending
the
books
the
three
of
us
were
made
so
happy
by
them
and
are
still
for
that
matter
we
think
it
is
splendid
that
you
should
think
of
us
we
also
think
and
speak
of
you
and
of
your
toradjas
of
your
work
and
of
everything
that
we
discussed
that
evening
at
the
abendanons
the
hours
that
we
spent
in
your
company
are
among
the
most
delightful
memories
of
our
visit
to
batavia
we
hope
with
our
whole
hearts
that
will
not
be
our
only
meeting
but
that
we
may
see
you
often
again
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
us
if
some
day
we
might
bid
you
welcome
to
japara
we
have
much
sympathy
for
the
work
of
the
christian
missionaries
in
dutch
india
and
we
admire
the
nobility
of
heart
of
those
who
have
established
themselves
in
the
most
remote
stretches
of
wilderness
far
from
their
own
country
and
kindred
and
from
all
congenial
companions
and
cut
themselves
off
from
the
world
in
which
by
virtue
of
birth
ability
and
education
they
would
have
an
honourable
position
to
bring
light
into
the
lives
of
fellow
men
called
by
the
cultivated
world
savages
we
read
both
your
letters
with
deep
interest
and
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
telling
us
so
much
that
was
interesting
and
of
which
we
were
ignorant
in
we
had
the
privilege
and
pleasure
of
witnessing
a
solemnity
the
memory
of
which
will
probably
remain
with
us
all
of
our
lives
that
was
the
dedication
of
the
new
church
at
kedoeng
pendjalin
it
was
the
first
time
that
we
had
ever
been
in
a
christian
church
and
at
a
christian
service
and
what
we
saw
and
heard
there
made
a
deep
impression
upon
us
it
was
long
ago
but
it
is
still
fresh
in
my
memory
the
spacious
building
was
decorated
with
green
foliage
and
the
singing
which
echoed
under
the
high
roof
was
beautiful
with
the
reverent
attentive
multitude
we
followed
the
words
which
came
forth
from
the
chancel
in
pure
javanese
besides
the
heer
hubert
there
were
three
missionary
students
who
preached
upon
the
occasion
and
it
was
certainly
not
the
least
solemn
moment
of
the
whole
solemn
service
when
an
old
decrepit
javanese
stood
up
to
speak
of
his
faith
to
his
everything
was
so
impressive
that
the
occasion
has
always
been
a
memorable
one
to
me
it
was
on
that
morning
that
i
had
seen
the
outside
world
again
for
the
first
time
since
my
we
read
in
the
paper
under
the
sailing
news
that
mevrouw
was
back
again
in
india
so
she
will
be
with
you
very
soon
we
were
right
glad
for
your
sake
when
we
read
it
this
letter
is
as
though
we
made
you
and
mevrouw
a
visit
of
felicitation
upon
her
return
to
wish
her
although
we
are
still
unknown
to
her
a
hearty
welcome
to
mapane
are
not
the
toradjas
very
happy
to
have
their
mother
among
them
again
a
race
in
middle
celebes
among
whom
adriani
worked
xviii
may
i
have
been
through
so
much
in
my
young
life
but
it
is
all
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
i
have
suffered
in
these
last
dreadful
days
of
father
illness
there
were
hours
when
i
was
without
will
but
trembled
with
inward
pain
and
the
lips
that
had
defiantly
proclaimed
come
what
may
now
stammered
god
pity
me
my
birthday
was
a
double
feast
a
celebration
also
of
father
restoration
to
health
i
let
father
see
your
present
and
told
him
how
pleased
you
were
with
his
portrait
father
lay
upon
a
lounging
chair
i
sat
next
to
him
on
the
floor
his
hand
resting
upon
my
head
it
was
thus
that
i
spoke
to
him
of
you
father
smiled
when
i
told
him
of
your
enthusiastic
expression
of
sympathy
for
him
and
with
that
smile
on
his
face
and
certainly
with
a
thought
for
the
distant
and
loved
friend
of
his
child
my
sick
one
slept
see
how
near
you
are
to
me
stella
to
us
do
you
believe
now
that
it
was
not
lack
of
affection
which
kept
me
silent
for
so
long
and
can
you
forgive
that
silence
now
let
me
earnestly
thank
you
now
for
your
friendship
and
your
love
which
have
added
so
much
to
my
life
and
let
me
now
press
you
fast
to
my
heart
in
thought
if
i
could
only
see
you
in
reality
face
to
face
and
heart
to
heart
so
that
i
could
open
my
soul
to
you
my
soul
which
is
so
full
of
sadness
stella
my
stella
i
should
be
so
glad
if
i
could
make
you
happy
with
but
one
rejoicing
letter
cheer
you
with
the
tidings
that
we
had
succeeded
that
we
had
reached
our
goal
alas
instead
this
bears
a
complaint
i
do
not
like
to
complain
but
the
truth
must
be
told
an
unexpected
turn
has
come
in
our
affairs
the
question
is
now
more
difficult
than
ever
it
is
a
matter
of
standing
or
falling
of
blessed
success
or
of
complete
undoing
and
our
hands
are
bound
there
is
a
duty
which
is
called
gratitude
there
is
a
high
holy
duty
called
filial
love
and
there
is
a
detestable
evil
called
egoism
sometimes
it
is
so
difficult
to
see
where
the
good
ends
and
the
bad
begins
one
may
go
a
certain
distance
and
then
the
boundary
between
the
two
extremes
is
hardly
visible
father
health
is
such
that
he
is
subject
to
severe
heart
attacks
do
you
know
what
that
means
we
are
defenceless
delivered
over
to
the
pleasure
of
blind
fate
we
have
stood
so
close
to
the
fulfillment
of
our
dearest
wishes
and
now
we
are
again
far
away
it
is
a
bitter
awakening
after
we
had
thought
that
all
stumbling
blocks
had
been
cleared
from
our
way
the
poor
tortured
heart
cries
out
what
is
my
duty
and
no
answer
comes
while
those
who
wait
grope
round
in
deepest
darkness
we
can
no
longer
seek
for
consolation
in
that
splendid
plan
of
the
government
to
open
a
school
which
would
educate
the
daughters
of
regents
to
become
teachers
nothing
will
ever
come
of
it
for
many
regents
whose
consent
had
to
be
obtained
declared
themselves
against
any
innovation
that
would
interfere
with
the
custom
of
secluding
young
girls
and
releasing
them
from
their
imprisonment
by
allowing
them
to
go
away
from
home
to
school
it
has
been
a
hard
blow
for
us
for
we
had
built
all
our
hopes
upon
it
adieu
illusions
adieu
golden
dreams
of
the
future
you
were
too
beautiful
to
be
true
i
used
to
sit
idly
and
take
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
how
your
eyes
would
shine
when
you
heard
the
splendid
news
and
now
the
whole
proposal
has
evaporated
like
smoke
has
gone
to
the
moon
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
our
friends
at
batavia
are
away
on
a
journey
but
it
goes
very
very
badly
now
if
the
plan
for
the
domestic
school
for
native
girls
should
be
in
the
same
case
put
down
through
the
unwillingness
of
the
parents
themselves
there
will
be
nothing
left
my
fingers
burn
to
write
about
the
splendid
plans
of
the
director
of
education
and
about
the
proposed
education
of
regents
daughters
to
be
teachers
but
i
remain
idle
i
must
not
express
my
opinions
on
important
subjects
least
of
all
through
means
of
the
press
many
persons
in
our
immediate
surroundings
know
nothing
of
what
is
brooding
and
raging
within
us
they
know
nothing
of
our
plans
one
of
our
acquaintances
who
comes
to
the
house
often
read
in
the
newspapers
about
the
proposed
school
for
regents
daughters
and
said
to
my
sisters
that
would
be
just
the
thing
for
me
and
that
she
and
her
husband
would
urge
me
to
think
seriously
about
it
her
husband
spoke
to
me
of
the
same
thing
and
with
a
blank
face
as
though
knowing
nothing
i
let
him
speak
both
husband
and
wife
are
enthusiastic
for
the
work
of
emancipating
the
native
woman
he
is
a
government
official
and
for
that
reason
can
do
much
for
our
cause
he
will
soon
be
promoted
and
then
they
will
both
be
able
to
do
much
more
for
our
people
we
have
devised
a
plan
for
her
and
she
and
her
husband
have
listened
to
it
with
interest
when
he
becomes
assistant
resident
she
is
to
invite
the
little
daughters
of
the
native
officials
serving
under
him
to
come
to
her
house
on
certain
fixed
days
and
give
them
instruction
in
handiwork
and
cooking
perhaps
also
in
reading
and
writing
that
would
be
a
useful
and
beneficent
work
the
lady
is
delighted
with
the
idea
i
have
naturally
told
her
much
about
you
she
will
become
with
pleasure
a
member
of
the
onderlinge
vrouwenbescherming
she
has
two
little
daughters
in
holland
one
wishes
to
become
an
advocate
and
the
other
too
will
study
a
profession
i
told
her
that
it
was
my
earnest
wish
before
i
started
out
in
life
in
whatever
capacity
to
spend
first
at
least
half
a
year
at
work
in
a
hospital
to
learn
something
of
the
care
of
the
sick
because
now
if
sickness
should
fall
under
my
hands
i
should
not
know
which
way
to
turn
she
said
at
once
that
her
who
is
a
doctor
would
help
to
initiate
me
into
the
secrets
of
sick
nursing
the
doctor
is
a
newcomer
speaks
no
javanese
and
very
broken
malay
i
can
be
of
service
to
him
in
turn
by
acting
as
interpreter
for
a
large
majority
of
his
patients
are
either
natives
or
chinese
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
this
plan
of
spending
some
time
in
a
hospital
it
would
add
a
great
deal
to
my
education
i
have
sat
and
pondered
over
it
long
what
do
you
think
of
it
oh
it
is
misery
on
top
of
misery
to
see
some
one
suffer
frightful
pain
and
not
to
know
how
to
alleviate
that
pain
those
who
watch
suffer
even
more
than
the
patient
himself
i
have
sat
by
many
sick
beds
even
as
a
child
and
speak
from
experience
the
idea
of
studying
nursing
came
to
me
at
the
of
a
dear
one
later
i
shall
speak
out
and
say
frankly
what
i
have
in
my
heart
in
regard
to
the
education
of
girls
i
shall
plead
for
the
importance
of
a
knowledge
of
hygiene
and
of
the
structure
of
the
human
body
to
women
i
want
to
see
hygiene
and
physiology
placed
on
the
curriculum
of
the
school
which
is
to
be
erected
poor
bunglers
eh
who
after
so
much
must
gulp
down
those
subjects
what
an
ideal
school
that
institute
for
native
young
ladies
will
be
science
cooking
handiwork
hygiene
and
vocational
training
all
must
be
there
it
is
only
a
dream
but
let
us
dream
if
it
makes
us
happy
why
not
what
i
have
written
thus
far
for
the
public
has
been
but
nonsense
suggested
by
some
special
happening
or
other
i
may
never
mention
serious
subjects
alas
later
when
we
shall
have
wholly
wrested
ourselves
loose
from
the
iron
grip
of
traditions
it
will
be
different
it
would
be
different
now
were
it
not
for
the
love
which
we
have
for
our
dearest
parents
father
would
not
be
pleased
if
the
name
of
his
daughter
should
be
rolled
under
the
tongues
of
men
when
i
am
wholly
free
and
independent
i
shall
speak
out
and
say
what
i
think
so
till
that
time
comes
patience
stella
for
i
can
not
send
you
nonsense
when
i
write
something
in
which
i
myself
am
pleased
in
which
my
deepest
convictions
are
expressed
i
shall
send
it
to
you
to
mejuffrouw

june
we
know
what
borel
has
written
on
the
gamelan
he
calls
it
soul
music
do
you
know
other
things
by
him
as
well
het
jongetje
is
charming
many
think
borel
morbid
and
unwholesome
but
we
enjoy
him
de
laatste
incarnatie
is
very
fine
and
his
droom
uit
tosari
is
still
finer
in
that
he
writes
of
the
wonderful
natural
beauty
of
java
blue
mountains
how
much
we
enjoyed
it
one
must
be
an
artist
or
at
least
have
been
subjected
to
a
lively
dose
of
artistic
feeling
to
see
and
take
pleasure
in
the
beauties
of
mother
nature
and
to
be
able
to
express
it
in
fine
clear
style
such
an
one
must
be
a
dear
privileged
human
child
upon
whose
forehead
the
muses
have
pressed
a
kiss
i
hope
some
day
to
have
an
opportunity
to
study
your
beautiful
musical
language
i
shall
not
let
the
chance
go
by
without
making
use
of
it
you
may
be
assured
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
it
would
make
me
happy
above
everything
and
if
i
should
ever
be
so
fortunate
as
to
master
the
german
language
then
i
shall
go
and
look
for
you
will
it
not
be
a
good
idea
in
the
meantime
flying
machines
will
have
come
into
use
and
on
some
golden
day
you
will
see
one
of
them
flutter
over
jena
blue
horizon
bringing
a
guest
from
afar
i
should
indeed
have
been
born
a
boy
then
perhaps
i
should
be
able
to
carry
out
some
of
my
plans
now
as
a
girl
in
our
present
native
civilization
it
is
almost
impossible
to
take
a
little
walk
down
a
turnpike
how
can
anything
else
be
expected
when
in
europe
the
centre
of
civilization
and
of
enlightenment
the
strife
should
have
been
so
long
and
so
bitter
for
the
good
right
of
the
woman
could
one
in
earnest
expect
that
india
uncivilized
unenlightened
slumbering
india
should
take
it
well
that
her
daughters
women
who
through
centuries
had
been
looked
upon
as
beings
of
a
lower
order
yes
why
should
i
not
say
it
as
soulless
creatures
should
suddenly
be
regarded
as
human
beings
who
have
a
right
to
independent
ideas
to
freedom
of
thought
of
feeling
and
of
conduct
alas
nothing
will
come
of
that
splendid
plan
of
the
government
from
which
we
expected
so
much
nothing
will
come
of
it
because
the
majority
of
native
chiefs
opposed
it
adieu
illusions
ah
i
have
often
thought
and
repeated
aloud
that
dreams
and
ideals
were
useless
ballast
in
our
native
civilization
a
superfluous
and
dangerous
luxury
but
that
says
the
mouth
alone
at
the
instigation
of
the
cold
understanding
it
makes
no
impression
upon
that
stupid
crazy
thing
the
heart
for
dreams
of
freedom
have
taken
such
deep
root
in
our
hearts
that
they
are
never
more
to
be
uprooted
without
making
desolate
the
soil
from
which
they
have
sprung
i
think
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
give
yourself
such
concern
in
regard
to
my
future
i
am
deeply
grateful
but
oh
do
you
know
nothing
but
sadness
concerning
me
we
know
what
awaits
us
we
three
are
going
hand
in
hand
through
life
that
for
us
will
be
full
of
struggle
and
disappointment
the
way
that
we
have
chosen
is
certainly
not
strewn
with
roses
it
is
filled
with
thorns
but
we
have
chosen
it
out
of
love
and
with
love
and
a
joyous
mind
we
shall
follow
it
it
leads
to
the
raising
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
poor
oppressed
and
souls
our
sisters
it
leads
toward
freedom
and
happiness
for
millions
for
our
fellow
countrymen
too
will
inevitably
be
brought
to
a
higher
moral
condition
and
then
they
will
work
with
us
on
that
eternal
work
of
striving
for
perfection
that
giant
work
at
which
through
the
centuries
the
noblest
and
best
have
toiled
trying
to
lead
mankind
upward
toward
the
light
and
in
short
to
bring
our
beautiful
earth
nearer
to
heaven
is
not
that
worth
striving
for
all
one
life
it
is
the
dream
of
tiga
soedara
the
three
javanese
sisters
in
the
distant
sunny
land
oh
could
we
but
go
to
the
land
of
changing
seasons
the
land
of
warmth
and
cold
the
fatherland
of
learning
to
prepare
ourselves
there
for
the
good
fight
that
we
wish
to
make
for
the
future
happiness
and
of
our
people
above
all
the
mind
should
be
cultivated
before
one
can
do
good
although
people
assert
that
to
do
good
and
to
be
intellectual
are
two
different
things
but
i
think
that
it
takes
the
greatest
wisdom
to
overcome
the
opposing
forces
that
we
human
beings
all
feel
in
us
to
temper
them
and
to
regulate
them
so
that
they
may
work
harmoniously
together
i
have
seen
so
often
that
to
try
to
do
good
ignorantly
does
more
harm
than
good
europe
must
you
then
remain
always
unattainable
for
us
we
who
long
for
you
with
heart
and
soul
but
i
do
not
believe
in
repining
life
is
too
beautiful
too
splendid
to
be
wasted
in
complaints
about
things
which
can
never
be
changed
let
us
be
thankful
for
the
many
blessings
that
the
good
god
has
bestowed
upon
us
are
we
not
fortunate
above
thousands
and
thousands
of
others
in
the
possession
of
our
dear
parents
good
health
and
in
a
number
of
little
blessings
which
make
up
the
sum
of
our
daily
lives
when
we
have
enjoyed
the
music
of
singing
birds
then
we
are
thankful
that
god
has
not
created
us
deaf
when
we
are
at
klein
scheveningen
that
idyllic
spot
by
the
sea
where
everything
breathes
quiet
and
peace
and
watch
the
sun
go
down
then
we
know
that
we
can
not
be
grateful
enough
that
we
have
good
eyes
to
enjoy
the
beautiful
light
which
plays
upon
the
golden
water
and
in
the
heaven
above
it
and
a
still
prayer
of
thanksgiving
toward
the
invisible
great
spirit
who
created
everything
and
governs
everything
a
joyful
thanksgiving
rises
from
my
heart
thanksgiving
that
i
may
and
am
able
to
see
so
much
for
there
are
many
who
can
not
not
only
the
poor
people
to
whom
the
days
and
nights
are
as
one
an
impenetrable
blackness
but
there
are
many
who
are
in
full
possession
of
their
faculties
yet
never
see
and
we
realize
how
privileged
we
are
above
so
many
of
our
fellow
men
and
gratitude
for
all
the
blessings
of
the
good
god
fills
our
souls
but
is
it
not
a
sad
thought
that
we
must
be
reminded
of
the
lack
in
others
in
order
to
appreciate
our
own
advantages
there
are
many
educated
native
women
many
many
cleverer
and
more
talented
than
we
who
have
been
hampered
not
at
all
in
the
cultivation
of
their
minds
who
could
have
become
anything
that
they
would
and
yet
they
have
done
nothing
have
attempted
nothing
that
could
lead
to
the
uplifting
of
their
sex
and
of
their
race
they
have
either
fallen
back
wholly
into
the
old
civilization
or
gone
over
to
that
of
the
europeans
in
both
cases
being
lost
to
their
people
to
whom
they
could
have
been
a
blessing
if
they
had
but
willed
it
is
it
not
the
duty
of
all
those
who
are
educated
and
on
a
higher
plane
to
stand
by
with
their
greater
knowledge
and
seek
to
lighten
the
way
for
those
who
are
less
fortunate
no
law
commands
this
but
it
is
a
moral
duty
forgive
me
if
i
have
tired
you
by
writing
at
too
great
length
how
did
i
come
to
take
up
so
much
of
your
valuable
time
with
the
babble
forgive
me
but
you
yourself
are
not
without
blame
your
two
letters
which
are
lying
before
me
are
so
sympathetic
when
i
read
their
cordial
words
it
is
as
though
i
had
you
before
me
and
that
is
what
i
have
imagined
all
the
time
that
i
have
been
writing
that
one
of
java
volcanoes
on
the
eastern
cape
has
broken
out
frightfully
and
cost
many
lives
you
will
certainly
have
learned
from
others
so
i
shall
not
write
of
that
according
to
the
papers
two
other
volcanoes
are
now
active
oh
inscrutable
beautiful
blue
mountains
the
eclipse
of
the
sun
on
the
of
may
for
the
observation
of
which
scientists
from
all
over
the
world
came
to
java
we
could
scarcely
see
here
at
all
owing
to
the
unfortunate
weather
the
day
was
cloudy
and
there
was
and
is
still
rain
but
what
was
vexation
to
us
was
a
blessing
to
the
farmers
father
was
made
very
happy
by
the
good
rain
which
refreshed
the
thirsty
fields
and
so
much
depends
upon
that
so
much
can
depend
upon
a
single
shower
of
rain
woe
or
weal
to
hundreds
yes
to
thousands
to
professor
and
anton
of
jena
xx
dear
hilda
let
me
begin
by
sending
you
both
in
the
name
of
my
sisters
too
heartfelt
wishes
of
happiness
on
the
birth
of
your
second
son
we
hope
from
our
hearts
that
he
may
become
just
such
a
sweet
healthy
little
fellow
as
his
brother
who
will
grow
in
time
into
a
fine
man
and
make
you
both
right
proud
how
does
our
little
friend
act
under
his
new
dignity
of
big
brother
does
he
not
want
to
play
with
alfred
right
away
the
little
one
is
too
eager
is
it
not
true
a
may
child
de
genestet
has
written
such
a
beautiful
poem
about
that
the
ending
is
sad
but
i
fervently
hope
that
the
prayer
of
the
poet
in
the
last
two
couplets
may
be
fulfilled
for
your
may
child
although
naturally
you
know
the
lines
yourself
i
can
not
help
repeating
them
again
here

gij
knaapje

i
hear
you
laugh
when
you
have
read
the
verses
how
foolish
eh
but
do
not
be
surprised
at
them
all
old
aunts
become
more
or
less
sentimental
and
to
that
category
belongs
she
who
now
writes
to
mevrouw
de
may
the
god
of
springtime
spread
roses
before
your
feet
may
the
god
of
love
lead
and
keep
you
gentle
true
and
good
bloom
in
your
father
garden
bloom
at
your
mother
side
the
loveliest
flower
on
earth
to
them
thou
little
blossom
of
may
xxi
of
august
we
javanese
can
not
live
without
flowers
and
sweet
odours
the
native
flowers
in
their
splendour
awaken
in
me
a
world
of
thought
and
feeling
whenever
i
breathe
in
their
perfume
days
afterwards
it
lives
in
my
memory
and
i
feel
the
strong
javanese
blood
coursing
through
my
veins
oh
soul
of
my
people
that
used
to
be
too
beautiful
that
was
full
of
kindness
poetry
gentleness
and
modesty
what
has
become
of
you
what
have
time
and
slothfulness
not
made
of
you
it
is
so
often
said
that
we
are
more
european
than
javanese
in
our
hearts
sad
thought
we
know
that
we
are
impregnated
with
european
ideas
and
feelings
but
the
blood
the
javanese
blood
that
flows
live
and
warm
through
our
veins
can
never
die
we
feel
it
in
the
smell
of
incense
and
in
the
perfume
of
flowers
in
the
tones
of
the
gamelan
in
the
sighing
of
the
wind
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
cooing
of
the
turtle
doves
the
whistling
of
the
fields
of
ripened
rice
in
the
pounding
of
the
at
the
time
of
the
rice
harvest
not
for
nothing
have
we
passed
our
whole
lives
amid
surroundings
where
everything
depends
upon
form
we
have
learned
the
emptiness
of
those
forms
their
lack
of
meaning
and
of
substance
there
is
much
good
in
the
javanese
people
we
are
so
anxious
for
you
to
admire
our
people
when
i
see
something
fine
some
trait
of
character
that
is
peculiarly
javanese
then
i
think
how
glad
i
should
be
if
mevrouw
were
with
us
she
would
be
pleased
at
this
thing
would
appreciate
it
she
who
has
wide
open
eyes
for
everything
that
is
noble
our
little
javanese
as
you
call
him
has
made
something
very
beautiful
with
the
whole
wajanghistory
carved
upon
it
wajang
figures
on
the
cover
on
the
outside
and
inside
both
and
on
all
four
walls
there
is
a
case
designed
to
protect
it
which
is
also
ornamented
with
wajang
figures
the
box
is
lined
with
orange
satin
which
is
gathered
and
pleated
and
it
is
set
off
by
a
silver
rim
also
of
native
workmanship
indeed
it
ought
to
be
very
beautiful
for
it
is
designed
to
hold
the
portraits
of
the
regents
of
java
and
madeira
which
the
queen
has
ordered
sent
to
her
this
mark
of
homage
is
a
pretty
idea
the
regent
of
garoat
ordered
the
box
and
i
was
given
free
play
i
might
spend
as
much
as
i
liked
for
both
objects
to
mevrouw
abendanon
in
java
the
rice
is
beaten
from
the
husks
by
great
wooden
mortars
the
pounding
noise
made
by
these
on
the
sawahs
rice
fields
at
the
time
of
the
harvest
produces
a
monotonous
cadence
wajang
is
the
javanese
drama
it
is
very
ancient
and
in
the
century
was
already
a
traditional
institution
in
its
present
form
it
presents
always
the
romantic
legends
or
sagas
of
the
island
though
some
of
the
stories
are
versions
of
those
in
hindu
mythology
and
were
introduced
after
the
hindu
occupation
of
java
there
are
three
principal
forms
of
wajang
the
most
common
is
the
wajang
kĕlitik
or
little
wajangs
puppets
made
of
leather
the
master
of
the
show
or
delang
manipulates
the
strings
and
recites
the
lines
behind
the
scenes
sometimes
the
performances
last
from
in
the
evening
until
in
the
morning
the
wajang
topeng
or
lyric
drama
existed
in
the
year
and
probably
earlier
the
performers
are
men
and
women
wearing
grotesque
masks
animal
masks
such
as
tigers
elephants
wild
boars
birds
are
often
worn
in
the
presence
of
royalty
the
actors
play
unmasked
the
wajang
beber
is
of
very
early
origin
and
is
a
shadow
play
shadows
of
marionettes
being
shown
through
a
white
cloth
at
the
time
of
the
mohammedan
conquest
in
the
century
and
after
the
forcible
conversion
of
the
javanese
to
mohammedanism
an
effort
was
made
to
change
the
wajangs
to
conform
with
the
mohammedan
law
which
forbade
the
representation
of
human
beings
hence
the
introduction
of
the
grotesque
contorted
masks
still
in
use
wajang
performances
are
always
accompanied
by
gamelan
music
explanatory
verse
and
a
chorus
with
chants
xxii
you
must
have
thought
it
ungracious
of
me
to
remain
silent
for
so
long
after
your
charming
letter
and
your
goodness
in
sending
the
dear
kiekje
which
i
have
enjoyed
so
much
the
silence
has
not
been
from
lack
of
appreciation
but
because
the
one
wholly
sound
kartini
had
all
of
her
time
taken
up
with
the
little
sick
sisters
it
was
so
warm
it
was
not
hard
to
exaggerate
a
little
indisposition
so
that
we
could
not
help
spoiling
our
invalids
just
now
one
of
the
pairs
of
eyes
which
i
have
seen
so
troubled
peeped
over
my
shoulder
and
read
this
child
child
what
do
you
gain
by
it
the
children
will
never
hear
any
praise
from
me
i
assure
you
but
what
am
i
doing
now
speaking
ill
of
my
dear
little
sisters
nothing
is
impossible
in
this
world
what
we
look
upon
today
as
an
impossibility
tomorrow
may
be
an
accomplished
fact
there
is
a
restlessness
in
our
native
civilization
the
spirit
of
progress
is
moving
among
us
it
is
strongly
combated
by
the
inherent
love
which
the
javanese
has
for
the
ancient
laws
there
will
be
a
hard
fight
before
these
hoary
ideas
and
customs
shall
be
deeply
buried
in
the
ground
never
again
to
rise
to
mevrouw
de
xxiii
i
should
be
so
glad
so
happy
if
i
could
be
in
a
position
to
lead
children
hearts
to
form
little
characters
to
awaken
young
minds
to
help
to
mould
the
women
of
the
future
who
will
be
able
to
carry
forward
enlightenment
like
a
torch
there
is
much
misery
in
our
javanese
world
there
has
always
been
so
much
suffering
so
much
bitterness
the
only
road
which
lies
open
to
a
javanese
girl
and
above
all
to
one
of
noble
birth
is
marriage
from
far
and
near
we
know
of
the
horrible
misery
of
the
woman
caused
by
certain
mohammedan
institutions
that
are
so
easy
for
the
man
but
oh
so
bitterly
hard
and
miserable
for
her
she
soon
grows
accustomed
to
it
she
finds
that
it
is
nothing
say
the
wise
men
and
then
we
should
have
no
more
peace
if
we
put
such
ideas
into
her
head
let
me
a
child
of
java
nourished
at
her
breast
who
has
lived
here
all
her
life
assure
you
that
the
native
women
have
honest
simple
hearts
that
can
feel
and
suffer
as
well
as
the
most
delicate
sensitive
heart
in
your
country
but
here
there
is
a
suppressed
suffering
which
consumes
itself
for
she
feels
herself
powerless
and
defenceless
through
her
ignorance
and
inexperience
the
old
traditions
speak
fatima
bridegroom
takes
a
new
wife
and
she
is
asked
by
the
prophet
what
she
feels
nothing
father
nothing
she
declared
and
while
saying
this
she
leaned
against
a
banana
tree
the
leaves
formerly
fresh
and
green
withered
and
the
trunk
against
which
her
body
rested
shrivelled
into
ashes
again
the
father
asked
her
what
she
felt
and
she
said
nothing
father
nothing
the
father
gave
her
a
raw
egg
and
bade
her
hold
it
against
her
heart
he
asked
her
to
give
it
back
to
him
he
broke
it
open
and
the
egg
was
cooked
the
eastern
woman
heart
has
not
changed
many
think
it
an
honour
to
tolerate
with
unmoved
countenances
the
one
or
more
women
their
husbands
have
brought
home
but
do
not
ask
what
is
hidden
behind
that
iron
mask
or
what
the
walls
of
their
dwellings
could
tell
when
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
removed
there
are
so
many
burning
women
hearts
with
poor
innocent
suffering
childlike
souls
and
it
was
the
misery
that
i
saw
even
in
my
childish
years
that
first
awakened
in
me
the
desire
to
fight
against
these
customs
and
substitute
justice
for
old
tradition
our
work
will
have
a
aim
first
to
help
to
enlighten
all
our
people
and
secondly
to
raise
up
our
sisters
so
that
they
may
live
and
be
treated
as
human
beings
to
all
of
you
who
have
sympathy
for
java
and
the
javanese
we
send
an
urgent
prayer
help
us
to
realize
our
ideals
they
mean
so
much
to
our
people
and
to
our
sex
raise
the
javanese
woman
educate
her
heart
and
her
understanding
and
you
will
have
splendid
workers
to
with
you
in
your
noble
work
your
giant
work
the
work
of
civilizing
and
enlightening
a
whole
nation
teach
her
a
trade
so
that
she
will
no
longer
be
powerless
when
her
guardians
command
her
to
contract
a
marriage
which
will
inevitably
plunge
her
and
whatever
children
she
may
have
into
misery
the
only
escape
from
such
conditions
is
for
the
girl
herself
to
learn
to
be
independent
there
is
no
one
yet
who
does
it
who
dares
do
it
it
is
a
disgrace
for
a
girl
not
to
marry
to
remain
an
unprotected
woman
our
idea
is
to
open
as
soon
as
we
have
the
means
an
institute
for
the
daughters
of
native
chiefs
where
they
will
be
fitted
for
practical
life
and
will
be
taught
as
well
the
things
which
elevate
the
spirit
and
ennoble
the
mind
would
such
a
school
succeed
we
are
bold
enough
to
answer
yes
many
of
the
native
chiefs
send
their
daughters
to
school
now
but
it
is
only
for
the
accomplishments
and
not
because
they
expect
it
to
be
of
any
practical
use
or
of
real
benefit
to
the
woman
herself
still
that
does
not
minimize
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
more
and
more
they
are
educating
their
daughters
the
many
government
and
private
schools
can
testify
to
the
truth
of
this
even
the
emperor
of
solo
sends
his
daughters
to
school
in
progressive
preanger
where
the
education
of
girls
is
no
new
thing
a
special
school
for
daughters
of
the
nobles
subsidized
by
the
government
has
been
opened
there
are
even
regents
daughters
who
go
to
a
domestic
school
in
a
strange
place
then
there
are
many
parents
who
would
like
to
send
their
daughters
to
school
yet
refuse
to
send
them
where
they
would
have
to
study
with
boys
the
expense
of
having
a
governess
is
far
beyond
the
means
of
an
ordinary
native
magistrate
only
a
few
are
able
to
afford
it
no
wedona
who
has
not
an
independent
fortune
can
keep
a
governess
for
his
little
daughter
there
was
a
young
mother
who
asked
her
husband
on
the
last
day
of
her
life
as
a
dying
request
to
carry
out
one
of
her
dreams
which
was
as
soon
as
he
should
be
in
better
circumstances
to
send
her
little
daughter
to
the
european
school
we
have
talked
over
this
question
and
also
the
idea
of
an
independent
woman
many
times
with
the
wives
of
native
chiefs
and
all
of
them
have
strengthened
us
in
our
belief
that
some
one
is
only
needed
to
take
the
first
step
to
set
the
example
and
then
the
path
will
have
been
opened
and
others
will
follow
it
there
are
many
girls
who
think
and
feel
as
we
and
who
would
be
glad
to
break
the
bonds
in
which
the
mohammedan
law
holds
them
cloistered
but
they
remain
quiescent
before
that
there
is
no
one
now
who
does
it
there
must
be
some
one
to
be
first
there
is
a
native
chief
who
sought
permission
from
the
director
of
education
for
his
daughter
to
enter
the
medical
school
thrice
blessed
father
thrice
blessed
daughter
she
will
be
of
great
service
to
her
country
i
hope
that
she
will
be
able
to
carry
out
her
intentions
a
younger
sister
of
mine
roekmini
has
a
great
love
for
painting
and
it
is
her
wish
to
be
able
to
study
at
the
art
academy
so
that
later
she
may
work
for
the
development
of
our
native
art
does
not
a
people
art
go
hand
in
hand
with
a
people
civilization
and
if
she
found
that
the
art
academy
was
not
the
place
for
her
that
she
had
not
sufficient
talent
then
she
could
go
to
the
household
school
and
later
teach
the
future
women
the
worth
of
money
which
would
be
a
very
useful
thing
for
our
people
my
sister
and
i
should
then
be
able
to
work
together
and
what
we
are
most
anxious
to
have
taught
in
our
future
schools
is
hygiene
and
a
knowledge
of
sanitation
and
nursing
hygiene
and
nursing
should
be
part
of
one
education
so
many
misfortunes
could
have
been
averted
or
at
least
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
every
one
men
as
well
as
women
had
been
taught
something
of
this
useful
study
it
is
not
in
the
least
our
intention
to
try
to
make
of
the
javanese
by
giving
them
liberal
educations
our
idea
is
to
develop
the
fine
qualities
that
are
peculiar
to
their
race
to
help
them
to
gain
by
contact
with
another
civilization
not
to
the
detraction
of
their
own
but
to
its
enoblement
i
enjoyed
your
introduction
so
much
to
the
land
and
people
of
java
it
warmed
my
heart
to
read
the
charming
manner
in
which
the
beauty
of
my
country
was
pictured
and
its
wonder
places
described
often
an
overpowering
feeling
of
happiness
comes
over
us
when
we
are
out
in
god
free
nature
far
from
the
doings
of
little
souled
men
alone
with
nature
above
our
heads
the
blue
heavens
and
at
our
feet
the
unfathomable
sea
behind
us
waving
cocoanut
palms
oh
who
would
not
be
happy
amid
such
surroundings
sometimes
i
am
betrayed
into
an
egotistical
thought
oh
let
me
live
alone
in
this
pure
atmosphere
far
from
the
noise
of
the
market
place
from
worldly
cares
alone
with
nature
and
with
my
own
soul
that
is
pure
egoism
it
is
not
the
voice
of
life
we
are
meant
to
live
with
and
for
humanity
but
i
have
kept
you
too
long
already
you
have
other
and
more
useful
things
to
do
than
to
read
all
this
prattle
from
a
sentimental
javanese
girl
to
mevrouw
van
kol
xxiv
we
will
not
we
can
not
believe
that
our
lives
will
be
only
commonplace
and
monotonous
like
the
lives
of
thousands
of
others
before
us
and
as
will
be
those
of
thousands
of
those
who
come
after
us
and
yet
any
other
destiny
seems
so
improbable
only
once
the
fulfilment
of
our
nearest
and
dearest
wishes
seemed
near
now
it
is
unattainably
far
away
there
are
hours
when
the
tortured
human
heart
torn
with
doubt
cries
my
god
what
is
my
duty
seeing
two
duties
which
directly
oppose
and
antagonize
one
another
yet
how
can
two
things
that
are
diametrically
opposed
be
called
by
the
same
name
stay
says
a
voice
behind
me
surrender
your
own
wishes
and
longings
to
the
will
of
him
who
is
dear
to
you
and
to
whom
you
are
dear
the
struggle
has
been
good
for
it
has
served
to
strengthen
and
ennoble
your
own
spirit
stay
and
then
again
i
hear
another
voice
ever
loud
and
clear
which
says
go
work
for
the
realization
of
your
ideals
work
for
the
future
work
for
the
good
of
thousands
who
are
bent
beneath
the
yoke
of
unjust
laws
who
have
a
false
conception
of
good
and
evil
go
suffer
and
fight
your
work
will
be
for
all
time
which
is
the
higher
duty
the
first
or
the
last
there
are
not
many
people
in
the
world
never
mind
how
closely
they
may
be
bound
together
by
ties
of
blood
who
love
and
understand
one
another
as
do
my
father
and
i
there
is
much
resemblance
in
our
characters
we
sympathize
in
everything
with
each
other
there
is
only
one
point
where
we
differ
oh
why
that
one
why
is
it
true
what
is
told
us
that
in
the
whole
of
wide
wide
nature
no
two
things
are
absolutely
alike
father
has
borne
so
patiently
with
all
my
caprices
i
have
never
heard
a
harsh
or
bitter
word
from
his
lips
he
is
always
loving
always
gentle
through
everything
i
feel
his
great
love
some
time
ago
when
i
pressed
him
for
a
decision
he
looked
at
me
so
sorrowfully
it
was
as
if
his
sad
eyes
asked
are
you
in
such
haste
to
leave
me
child
i
turned
away
my
head
i
did
not
wish
to
see
the
dear
true
eyes
i
wanted
to
be
strong
and
not
weak
my
heart
almost
broke
once
when
as
we
two
stood
opposed
to
each
other
father
clasped
me
in
his
arms
and
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
said
must
it
be
so
child
is
there
no
other
way
must
it
be
and
we
stayed
there
heart
pressed
to
heart
looking
into
each
other
eyes
that
was
a
heavy
time
as
heavy
as
a
time
can
well
be
on
this
earth
it
was
shortly
before
father
illness
later
when
father
was
recovering
mother
said
to
me
ah
child
give
in
to
him
i
can
not
i
answered
in
a
choking
voice
since
then
mother
has
never
spoken
about
it
to
me
but
when
father
gives
his
consent
she
will
not
withhold
hers
she
is
all
love
and
tenderness
towards
us
but
that
only
makes
the
struggle
the
harder
pain
nothing
but
pain
is
all
that
we
have
brought
to
those
true
loving
hearts
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xxv
september
in
preanger
there
are
a
great
many
women
and
girls
who
have
been
to
school
and
who
speak
dutch
most
of
those
whose
acquaintance
we
made
talked
dutch
with
us
because
we
do
not
know
each
other
language
strange
that
we
should
make
an
agreeable
acquaintance
with
people
of
our
own
country
and
of
kindred
race
by
means
of
a
foreign
tongue
our
intercourse
was
cordial
free
and
unrestrained
they
are
a
cheerful
people
full
of
jest
and
merriment
i
have
many
things
in
my
mind
sometimes
my
fingers
itch
so
to
write
down
my
thoughts
to
be
able
to
throw
them
in
the
faces
of
the
multitude
but
what
good
would
that
do
people
would
shrug
their
shoulders
some
of
them
would
laugh
and
most
of
them
would
take
no
notice
whatever
one
might
as
well
be
an
idiot
or
a
simpleton
perhaps
it
is
better
so
for
who
knows
what
harm
a
pen
might
do
in
the
hands
of
an
inexperienced
uncomprehending
hothead
now
after
that
tirade
something
that
you
will
think
pleasant
a
short
while
ago
the
quarteros
with
another
comptroller
were
at
our
house
the
gentlemen
were
speaking
of
a
regent
whom
the
strange
comptroller
knew
well
a
fine
man
we
heard
him
say
and
then
no
he
is
not
married
except
to
a
woman
whom
he
can
not
present
just
an
ordinary
woman
of
the
people
by
whom
he
has
several
children
he
does
not
intend
to
marry
he
will
marry
no
because
then
he
would
have
to
send
the
woman
away
or
relegate
her
to
a
second
place
in
either
case
making
her
miserable
and
he
will
not
do
that
my
heart
leapt
when
i
heard
that
then
there
is
indeed
such
an
one
splendid
mevrouw
quartero
told
us
afterwards
that
both
she
and
her
husband
glanced
quickly
at
us
thinking
at
the
same
time
should
the
girls
have
heard
that
how
he
will
rise
in
their
esteem
so
it
is
too
we
hope
fervently
that
the
regent
will
always
remain
of
the
same
mind
and
that
he
will
never
be
turned
aside
from
his
good
resolution
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
us
to
make
his
acquaintance
we
hope
that
we
may
some
day
the
young
guard
regardless
of
sex
should
band
themselves
together
we
can
each
of
us
do
something
unaided
towards
the
uplifting
and
civilizing
of
our
people
but
if
we
were
united
our
strength
would
be
multiplied
many
times
by
working
together
we
could
gather
a
goodly
store
of
fruit
in
union
there
is
strength
and
power
to
mevrouw
abendanon
in
the
preanger
regencies
sundanese
is
spoken
it
bears
the
same
relation
to
javanese
that
scotch
did
to
english
in
the
century
xxvi
and
now
dear
friend
i
am
going
to
speak
of
myself
and
give
you
in
strictest
confidence
some
idea
of
our
plans
as
doctors
accoucheuses
writers
teachers
or
artists
we
could
gain
our
own
independence
and
at
the
same
time
work
for
the
good
of
our
fellow
countrymen
all
these
ways
now
stand
open
to
us
and
there
are
others
too
in
which
we
could
be
independent
but
we
do
not
desire
them
because
we
would
only
be
working
for
ourselves
and
not
for
our
people
what
could
we
do
for
them
if
we
were
apothecaries
assistants
telegraph
operators
clerks
in
an
office
or
something
of
that
kind
those
spheres
of
activity
do
not
attract
us
we
want
to
lead
full
rich
lives
you
know
the
government
through
the
director
of
education
is
planning
to
erect
schools
for
native
girls
and
by
way
of
example
a
domestic
school
for
the
daughters
of
the
nobles
when
we
heard
of
this
plan
last
year
from
the
director
himself
his
wife
asked
me
if
i
would
teach
in
this
last
school
i
answered
that
i
took
much
interest
in
the
plan
but
that
the
undertaking
would
be
too
great
for
me
because
i
had
no
training
and
would
not
be
capable
of
filling
such
a
position
mevrouw
said
that
her
husband
wanted
me
just
as
i
was
to
help
to
lead
the
young
hearts
and
to
form
the
young
characters
i
must
go
among
the
children
as
an
elder
sister
and
be
an
example
to
them
i
felt
highly
honoured
at
the
suggestion
but
unfitted
for
the
task
as
i
was
i
had
no
right
to
undertake
it
mevrouw
said
that
if
i
really
must
have
some
preparation
then
i
could
go
for
a
little
while
to
the
normal
school
at
batavia
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
my
own
wishes
that
my
father
approved
of
this
suggestion
you
know
already
when
i
went
to
batavia
i
saw
the
directress
of
the
girls
high
school
and
she
said
that
she
would
do
everything
in
her
power
to
help
me
this
cordiality
from
one
who
was
almost
a
stranger
was
very
encouraging
unsought
and
unexpected
this
offer
of
assistance
was
simply
thrown
into
my
lap
i
was
in
the
clouds
and
thought
that
my
departure
for
batavia
was
only
a
question
of
weeks
or
at
most
of
months
i
have
already
told
you
that
we
are
not
rich
though
father
has
a
large
income
at
the
same
time
his
expenditures
are
great
so
that
we
have
only
enough
to
live
quietly
and
to
give
our
boys
boys
must
be
helped
before
everything
to
give
the
boys
good
educations
i
had
also
thought
of
the
financial
difficulties
and
had
made
a
plan
so
that
the
expense
of
my
studies
would
not
be
too
great
a
burden
it
would
cost
my
father
twelve
hundred
florins
for
one
year
a
whole
income
and
no
small
sum
for
a
household
as
large
as
ours
so
my
thoughts
turned
towards
the
medical
school
at
batavia
tuition
in
medicine
is
free
at
least
for
boys
there
have
never
been
any
women
medical
students
one
can
study
medicine
at
the
expense
of
the
country
the
students
receive
free
lodging
a
monthly
allowance
to
cover
cost
of
food
and
clothing
and
there
is
free
medical
attendance
when
i
was
in
batavia
i
asked
the
director
of
education
to
which
department
the
school
of
medicine
belonged
and
if
girls
would
be
admitted
to
it
had
nothing
against
that
but
naturally
girls
would
be
special
students
my
idea
was
to
ask
the
government
to
admit
me
upon
the
same
footing
as
the
men
students
for
every
one
with
any
brains
at
all
can
see
how
useful
a
woman
doctor
would
be
especially
among
the
women
of
the
people
who
usually
would
rather
die
than
be
touched
by
a
strange
man
if
the
chief
of
the
department
of
education
would
support
my
petition
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
the
government
would
receive
it
favourably
i
have
already
thought
much
about
the
medical
profession
the
length
of
time
required
for
study
alone
disconcerts
me
for
one
who
is
not
yet
twenty
seven
years
of
study
does
not
seem
so
long
but
for
one
who
has
already
passed
that
age
it
is
very
long
and
then
as
a
full
grown
girl
to
have
to
sit
in
the
beginning
day
after
day
between
boys
of
from
thirteen
to
eighteen
and
to
be
the
only
woman
in
a
circle
of
men
is
not
pleasant
but
these
are
minor
difficulties
which
i
could
force
myself
to
overcome
there
is
still
something
else
father
and
my
friends
are
against
it
though
fortunately
not
unconditionally
father
objects
because
i
should
be
the
only
girl
among
all
those
men
and
boys
such
a
thing
would
be
unheard
of
here
and
my
friends
object
because
they
are
afraid
that
i
would
not
have
the
necessary
nerve
to
go
through
with
the
studies
medicine
is
certainly
a
splendid
calling
but
not
a
profession
for
every
one
a
strong
will
and
perseverance
are
not
enough
nerves
of
steel
are
also
a
necessity
that
is
what
worries
my
friends
so
that
they
give
me
no
peace
father
thinks
that
teaching
would
be
the
best
profession
for
me
as
do
also
my
friends
in
batavia
they
think
that
would
be
a
suitable
fine
work
for
me
where
i
could
spread
my
ideas
broadcast
among
the
younger
generation
the
women
and
mothers
of
the
future
as
a
teacher
even
of
a
little
circle
there
would
be
a
direct
influence
exerted
upon
that
little
circle
which
would
in
time
widen
and
spread
out
so
that
many
would
follow
my
example
you
know
my
love
for
literature
it
is
one
of
my
dreams
to
be
able
to
accomplish
something
there
it
is
true
one
can
not
serve
two
masters
at
the
same
time
but
i
see
no
reason
why
if
i
were
a
teacher
after
being
busy
with
the
children
all
day
i
could
not
work
at
literature
at
night
i
want
to
do
only
one
thing
at
a
time
and
do
that
well
ces
deux
mon
coeur
balance
as
a
doctor
or
something
else
perhaps
i
should
not
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that
other
work
of
which
i
am
so
fond
scribbling
with
my
pen
but
teaching
the
bringing
up
of
children
is
something
so
earnest
and
sacred
in
itself
that
i
should
never
be
at
peace
if
i
attempted
it
and
felt
myself
unable
to
do
it
well
as
a
teacher
of
the
domestic
school
i
should
be
with
the
children
the
whole
day
even
in
the
evening
and
at
night
i
should
not
be
wholly
free
because
the
children
would
be
under
my
care
such
a
post
would
bring
with
it
heavy
responsibilities
and
duties
perhaps
you
think
i
am
exaggerating
the
difficulties
and
responsibilities
but
i
can
not
look
upon
it
in
any
other
way
to
me
it
would
be
a
crime
to
devote
myself
to
the
bringing
up
of
children
future
carriers
of
civilization
to
the
race
and
not
to
be
fitted
for
that
great
task
which
is
so
high
and
holy
in
my
eyes
what
do
you
desire
for
me
stella
which
road
would
you
most
gladly
see
me
started
upon
tell
me
honestly
and
frankly
what
you
really
think
you
have
already
shown
yourself
a
good
true
friend
here
is
another
opportunity
there
is
still
another
profession
open
to
us
a
missionary
doctor
personally
unknown
to
us
but
of
good
name
and
established
reputation
has
heard
much
of
us
from
our
friends
and
has
offered
of
his
own
accord
to
train
us
free
of
cost
to
be
accoucheuses
you
will
certainly
have
heard
of
the
great
native
assembly
in
modjowarno
in
the
residency
of
soerabaja
the
name
of
this
missionary
doctor
is
known
in
connection
with
work
of
civilization
in
india
and
with
the
exhibition
of
women
work
you
must
know
too
that
there
is
a
crying
need
for
here
in
india
every
year
in
java
and
the
whole
of
about
twenty
thousand
women
die
in
and
there
are
on
an
average
thirty
thousand
children
all
from
lack
of
intelligent
care
in
that
direction
there
certainly
stretches
out
before
us
a
broad
field
of
usefulness
where
we
could
be
a
blessing
to
our
sisters
we
take
a
great
interest
in
this
cause
but
it
would
be
an
untruth
if
we
said
that
it
was
one
of
our
dreams
to
be
accoucheuses
but
it
would
be
one
thousand
times
better
to
be
than
to
be
dependent
held
to
narrow
household
cares
through
a
compulsory
marriage
we
have
father
permission
to
go
to
modjowarno
and
study
to
be
accoucheuses
when
all
other
doors
to
independence
shall
have
been
closed
to
us
he
is
strongly
opposed
to
a
work
of
personal
service
he
thinks
that
kind
of
work
would
be
degrading
to
our
aristocratic
hands
our
friends
at
first
deplored
the
idea
too
but
they
put
their
objections
on
such
a
noble
such
a
high
plane
they
thought
that
it
would
be
hard
for
us
because
we
had
other
dreams
and
ambitions
but
would
our
desire
to
lighten
the
way
and
to
be
examples
to
others
be
reached
in
this
manner
even
in
civilized
europe
the
calling
of
is
looked
down
upon
more
or
less
would
india
with
all
its
ceremony
and
form
be
able
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
work
people
here
would
only
see
its
humbleness
for
everything
that
does
not
shine
is
looked
upon
as
of
no
worth
by
my
poor
countrymen
you
understand
very
well
that
we
personally
would
be
indifferent
to
the
lowliness
of
our
calling
but
the
effect
which
that
would
have
should
not
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
us
if
we
want
to
break
the
path
to
freedom
and
independence
for
the
javanese
woman
we
must
set
a
practical
example
and
a
calling
that
is
looked
down
upon
and
considered
degrading
would
not
find
a
following
and
we
want
others
to
follow
in
our
footsteps
our
example
then
must
be
something
that
compels
respect
and
inspires
emulation
we
have
not
only
our
own
wishes
to
consider
we
must
reckon
with
the
prejudices
and
the
character
of
the
people
whom
we
wish
to
enlighten
lately
in
holland
and
especially
at
the
hague
there
has
been
a
growing
movement
of
interest
in
indian
art
the
association
of
the
east
and
west
an
offspring
of
the
exposition
of
woman
work
of
which
you
must
know
has
as
one
of
its
chief
purposes
the
encouragement
of
things
indian
there
is
a
special
division
for
art
composed
entirely
of
artists
of
reputation
they
are
planning
to
send
an
artist
to
india
to
help
the
cause
of
indian
art
in
general
but
especially
in
its
practical
application
and
to
protect
it
from
the
strange
influences
above
all
those
imported
from
europe
which
would
contaminate
its
true
character
i
have
already
told
you
that
roekmini
has
a
great
love
for
painting
and
certainly
some
talent
in
that
direction
and
it
is
her
desire
to
become
a
painter
of
course
study
in
europe
would
be
necessary
and
that
alas
is
unattainable
for
her
perhaps
through
our
own
efforts
we
may
be
able
to
help
little
sister
to
realize
her
dream
could
we
not
get
into
communication
with
east
and
west
and
might
not
my
sister
by
the
help
of
that
association
be
enabled
to
study
drawing
and
painting
at
the
art
academy
at
the
hague
later
she
could
return
to
java
and
dedicate
herself
wholly
to
the
art
of
her
own
country
if
all
our
plans
should
suffer
then
roekmini
will
fit
herself
to
be
an
accoucheuse
she
will
become
either
an
accoucheuse
or
a
painter
but
whichever
she
does
she
will
do
well
in
either
case
she
should
study
in
europe
in
holland
she
could
take
a
full
course
in
obstetrics
and
could
be
of
great
service
then
to
the
future
mothers
of
her
land
the
doctors
here
could
only
train
her
to
be
a
who
works
under
the
direction
of
a
doctor
to
our
indolent
people
with
their
exalted
ideas
it
would
make
a
great
difference
whether
an
accoucheuse
had
been
trained
here
or
in
europe
with
a
european
diploma
she
would
not
be
looked
upon
as
degraded
so
much
by
her
work
and
might
still
serve
as
an
example
and
as
a
light
to
be
followed
we
are
going
to
apply
for
an
appropriation
from
the
government
to
pay
for
her
education
in
holland
we
hope
for
the
assistance
of
hector
treub
in
amsterdam
and
of
stratz
in
the
hague
men
who
have
already
broken
their
lances
many
times
for
the
cause
of
obstetrics
in
india
through
ignorance
of
this
science
thousands
of
lives
are
needlessly
sacrificed
every
year
in
the
general
assembly
also
attention
was
called
to
this
cause
by
van
kol
it
is
said
that
kamerlid
is
coming
to
india
i
hope
to
see
him
and
to
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
him
my
brother
knows
him
very
well
the
government
here
in
india
has
already
taken
steps
toward
the
improvement
of
these
sad
conditions
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
java
all
doctors
who
wish
to
charge
themselves
with
the
training
of
receive
a
monthly
subsidy
from
the
government
the
prospective
receive
an
allowance
during
their
apprenticeship
to
cover
the
cost
of
board
and
other
necessities
and
after
they
have
passed
their
examinations
they
are
also
paid
by
the
government
after
she
had
completed
her
studies
in
europe
sister
roekmini
would
open
a
clinic
in
java
there
is
only
one
fault
to
be
found
with
the
teachings
of
the
doctors
that
we
have
here
that
is
obscurity
because
it
is
impossible
for
the
teachers
to
make
themselves
clearly
understood
by
the
students
when
they
speak
different
languages
almost
without
exception
the
doctors
here
have
little
or
no
command
of
our
language
malay
and
usually
very
much
broken
malay
at
that
is
the
language
which
the
doctors
use
towards
the
people
hardly
a
single
doctor
speaks
javanese
and
so
very
few
of
the
javanese
people
understand
and
speak
malay
the
difficulties
would
fall
away
if
some
one
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
native
language
would
undertake
the
task
of
training
roekmini
birth
will
be
of
great
help
to
her
in
this
for
the
natives
are
very
loyal
to
their
nobles
on
the
of
october
just
two
weeks
after
the
interruption
of
this
letter
i
come
back
to
it
again
my
card
sent
meanwhile
will
have
told
you
of
the
sad
state
in
which
we
have
been
happily
that
is
now
past
as
you
know
already
roekmini
has
been
dangerously
ill
twice
her
life
seemed
to
hang
upon
a
single
thread
now
thank
god
she
is
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
grows
each
day
a
little
stronger
today
she
has
been
out
of
doors
i
can
not
tell
you
how
happy
and
thankful
we
are
that
everything
has
gone
so
well
with
her
sister
kardinah
too
is
on
her
feet
again
she
can
now
take
little
walks
and
her
poor
thin
cheeks
are
beginning
to
fill
out
we
have
certainly
had
our
share
of
suffering
it
is
now
so
unhealthy
everywhere
on
account
of
the
drought
poor
country
so
much
hangs
over
you
besides
sickness
many
sawahs
over
the
whole
country
have
been
destroyed
by
the
great
drought
the
suffering
is
worse
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
grobogan
and
we
look
toward
demak
with
fear
and
anguish
there
thousand
sawahs
have
already
been
destroyed
and
cholera
is
raging
the
west
winds
will
soon
come
that
drown
the
land
every
year
poor
country
that
after
the
east
winds
dries
up
and
perishes
from
drought
and
after
the
west
winds
is
drowned
with
floods
but
i
shall
write
no
more
about
this
misery
but
only
tell
you
what
has
happened
during
the
last
fourteen
days
sister
kardinah
also
wishes
to
become
a
teacher
and
has
chosen
as
her
specialty
domestic
science
and
cooking
our
plan
is
to
remain
together
always
and
to
work
side
by
side
for
our
common
goal
the
education
of
our
people
if
fate
is
propitious
we
shall
open
a
school
in
which
instruction
will
be
given
along
broader
lines
than
mere
book
education
it
will
include
lessons
in
handiwork
household
arts
and
kindred
subjects
and
there
will
also
be
classes
in
and
painting
and
in
but
a
course
in
domestic
science
can
only
be
taken
in
holland
there
is
no
opportunity
here
kleintje
forte
is
really
music
and
her
dearest
dream
was
and
still
is
to
become
a
musician
but
that
is
absolutely
impossible
for
her
so
my
little
maid
has
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
she
is
so
eager
to
work
for
our
people
and
a
teacher
of
the
household
arts
could
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
good
more
and
more
the
government
realizes
what
a
great
advantage
it
would
be
to
the
people
and
their
rulers
if
they
could
learn
economy
we
may
appeal
to
the
government
on
behalf
of
kleintje
and
asked
that
she
be
placed
at
a
school
where
she
could
be
qualified
to
teach
domestic
economy
my
little
sister
wishes
to
undertake
the
great
task
of
teaching
the
women
and
future
mothers
of
java
economy
and
frugality
lately
the
government
has
shown
that
it
wishes
to
place
a
premium
upon
education
and
enlightenment
in
its
magistrates
this
has
been
evinced
by
the
latest
regents
appointments
according
to
custom
regents
have
been
appointed
by
the
law
of
heredity
from
father
to
son
and
if
there
is
no
son
available
then
some
near
relative
of
the
last
regent
is
appointed
it
has
never
happened
before
that
the
new
regent
was
no
connection
at
all
but
the
two
newly
appointed
men
are
progressive
and
enlightened
and
have
been
educated
in
europe
it
is
evident
that
the
government
is
in
earnest
in
its
endeavour
to
civilize
and
educate
the
people
of
java
and
especially
the
classes
from
which
the
government
servants
are
recruited
the
heer
abendanon
has
said
that
there
can
be
no
argument
against
the
statement
that
the
intellectual
awakening
of
the
native
people
can
not
progress
appreciably
as
long
as
the
woman
is
left
behind
in
the
forward
march
the
education
of
woman
has
always
been
an
important
factor
in
civilization
in
the
last
fifteen
years
the
government
of
has
sent
four
young
javanese
to
holland
at
its
own
expense
to
be
educated
there
as
teachers
so
that
they
may
come
back
later
to
work
for
the
good
of
their
fellow
countrymen
the
government
realized
that
their
work
would
have
better
results
if
they
received
their
educations
abroad
but
the
desire
to
do
this
did
not
come
of
itself
to
these
men
it
was
suggested
by
those
who
had
the
awakening
of
india
at
heart
with
us
it
is
different
in
us
the
impulse
the
longing
to
do
something
for
our
people
was
born
in
our
own
hearts
from
deeply
rooted
conviction
and
came
through
suffering
and
through
sympathy
for
the
suffering
of
others
we
are
only
waiting
for
father
permission
now
forgive
a
father
stella
that
he
hesitates
to
give
his
children
as
hostages
to
an
uncertain
future
as
innovators
as
pioneers
we
must
stand
alone
combat
and
overcome
obstacles
our
way
will
lead
through
much
suffering
and
discouragement
it
is
certain
and
what
parents
would
wish
to
see
their
children
zealous
for
suffering
what
parents
willingly
see
their
children
voluntarily
dedicate
themselves
to
lives
of
struggle
and
disappointment
i
do
not
know
that
i
should
go
to
holland
to
study
now
even
if
the
opportunity
were
offered
me
though
to
go
has
always
been
one
of
my
greatest
desires
last
year
when
it
was
suggested
that
i
study
at
home
i
set
myself
against
the
proposition
with
all
my
might
if
i
studied
at
all
i
wanted
to
study
properly
and
i
could
only
do
that
in
holland
or
at
batavia
and
as
holland
was
beyond
my
reach
my
head
was
set
upon
batavia
i
did
not
think
i
could
study
well
at
home
because
i
could
not
devote
my
whole
time
to
my
books
at
my
time
of
life
there
would
be
too
many
other
claims
upon
me
household
and
social
duties
would
keep
me
too
much
from
my
work
it
would
be
impossible
to
eliminate
them
if
i
remained
at
home
that
was
last
year
when
father
was
well
and
strong
now
father
is
that
no
longer
alas
forgive
a
daughter
stella
if
once
when
she
might
have
had
the
opportunity
to
fulfil
her
heart
wish
a
wish
upon
which
the
future
of
many
others
also
depended
she
held
back
because
she
had
not
the
heart
to
separate
from
a
father
who
had
given
her
love
and
care
her
whole
life
long
and
whose
feeble
health
now
demanded
more
than
ever
the
care
and
affection
which
she
alone
could
give
stella
i
am
a
child
i
am
a
daughter
not
a
woman
alone
who
can
give
herself
wholly
and
dedicate
herself
to
a
great
and
beautiful
work
i
am
also
a
child
bound
by
the
bonds
of
tenderest
love
and
gratitude
to
an
old
grey
father
who
has
grown
old
and
grey
through
care
for
his
children
of
these
children
perhaps
i
am
dearest
stella
you
who
know
my
great
love
for
him
and
next
to
that
my
love
for
what
i
regard
as
our
calling
who
know
the
strength
of
my
affection
for
my
sisters
will
be
able
to
understand
what
a
hard
conflict
there
is
in
store
for
me
i
must
be
separated
from
my
sisters
away
from
the
work
that
i
would
do
or
separated
from
father
united
with
my
sisters
and
giving
my
all
to
our
calling
father
is
weak
now
needs
care
and
my
first
duty
is
to
him
oh
stella
i
should
never
have
a
moment
peace
if
i
carried
on
my
own
work
far
away
from
father
knowing
that
he
was
suffering
and
needed
me
the
work
which
we
would
do
is
noble
it
will
not
be
only
for
the
present
but
for
all
time
still
i
should
never
be
able
to
answer
to
my
own
conscience
if
i
should
neglect
my
old
grey
father
for
any
cause
whatever
he
has
the
first
right
to
me
one
of
the
precepts
which
i
wish
to
inculcate
is
this
honour
every
living
creature
respects
their
rights
their
feelings
and
even
when
it
seems
necessary
shrink
from
causing
the
least
suffering
to
another
should
i
be
able
to
teach
others
what
i
myself
neglected
in
practice
i
must
never
forsake
my
duty
as
a
child
but
neither
must
i
forsake
the
duty
which
i
owe
to
myself
for
it
is
not
my
own
happiness
that
depends
upon
its
realization
but
great
good
to
others
the
problem
now
is
to
try
and
harmonize
as
far
as
possible
these
two
duties
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
the
only
solution
seemed
to
be
to
find
some
way
by
which
i
could
stay
with
father
and
also
go
on
with
my
studies
i
am
going
to
study
here
at
home
and
fit
myself
for
the
profession
of
teaching
just
as
well
as
one
can
be
fitted
by
when
it
is
supported
by
a
strong
will
and
perseverance
i
had
already
thought
of
this
plan
but
mevrouw
abendanon
gave
it
the
impetus
which
pushed
it
forward
when
she
suggested
some
time
ago
that
without
waiting
for
further
arbitraments
of
capricious
fate
we
three
go
ahead
and
study
here
at
home
we
have
had
a
governess
for
two
months
in
her
we
have
found
a
charming
and
affectionate
friend
she
is
still
very
young
a
girl
of
strong
character
who
has
left
her
family
in
the
fatherland
and
come
here
to
earn
her
daily
bread
it
is
only
unfortunate
that
this
miserable
sickness
has
come
otherwise
we
should
be
getting
along
famously
naturally
all
this
time
i
have
not
been
able
to
look
at
a
book
annie
glazer
that
is
our
teacher
name
has
engagements
which
take
her
on
some
days
to
another
family
here
but
as
soon
as
she
can
arrange
it
she
will
give
her
entire
time
to
us
or
to
me
alone
most
probably
for
my
poor
sisters
must
not
have
anything
in
their
hands
and
above
all
in
their
heads
just
now
they
feel
very
miserable
under
the
enforced
idleness
but
hands
and
heads
are
still
weak
what
do
you
think
about
all
of
these
high
flying
plans
if
only
you
do
not
say
poor
thing
you
are
trying
to
fly
too
high
i
shall
be
satisfied
do
you
know
what
i
have
noticed
among
our
friends
that
they
have
too
high
an
opinion
of
us
they
ascribe
to
us
qualities
and
abilities
which
we
do
not
possess
sometimes
we
have
to
laugh
at
their
enthusiasm
the
saying
that
love
is
blind
is
here
applicable
you
should
only
hear
some
of
the
things
of
which
they
think
us
capable
we
feel
our
own
limitations
deeply
whenever
our
friends
set
us
so
in
the
sun
we
feel
small
but
we
feel
grateful
too
for
the
love
of
which
it
speaks
one
friend
would
be
glad
to
see
me
work
with
my
pen
for
our
people
i
must
found
a
journal
devoted
to
their
needs
and
must
be
its
editor
or
i
must
become
a
writer
on
the
foremost
daily
newspaper
of
india
and
write
articles
by
which
those
who
are
now
fast
sleeping
will
be
frightened
wide
awake
had
i
no
reason
for
my
assertion
that
love
is
blind
and
now
i
must
think
of
parting
from
my
sisters
the
idea
is
frightful
to
them
and
it
is
no
less
so
to
me
if
they
are
successful
in
getting
that
for
which
they
are
asking
they
will
be
far
from
us
in
a
strange
land
it
is
fortunate
that
they
have
a
brother
there
who
even
as
i
loves
the
sisters
from
his
soul
this
brother
is
full
of
enthusiasm
and
sympathy
for
our
ideals
for
in
them
he
finds
an
echo
of
his
own
we
have
made
a
compact
with
him
that
when
he
has
completed
his
studies
he
will
come
back
to
us
and
we
will
work
together
it
is
an
inspiration
to
us
that
he
should
share
in
the
ideals
of
his
sisters
it
lifts
us
up
draws
us
forward
just
as
does
the
great
sympathy
and
understanding
which
you
have
for
us
there
is
still
another
young
man
european
who
only
knows
us
through
his
mother
but
who
sympathizes
with
our
cause
and
takes
a
lively
interest
in
it
the
sympathy
and
understanding
of
friends
even
when
we
do
not
know
them
personally
is
a
great
support
to
us
we
need
this
support

one
should
never
promise
anything
even
when
it
depends
entirely
upon
oneself
because
one
can
never
tell
beforehand
what
will
happen
never
mind
how
honestly
the
promise
is
made
and
how
earnestly
one
desires
to
keep
it
unforeseen
circumstances
may
arise
which
make
its
fulfillment
impossible
there
is
a
belief
among
us
javanese
that
those
who
break
a
promise
will
be
visited
by
a
poisonous
serpent
the
serpent
comes
to
remind
them
of
their
promise
if
they
do
not
quickly
fulfill
it
they
will
be
visited
by
another
more
venomous
serpent
whose
bite
is
deadly
if
they
delay
longer
misfortune
will
surely
overtake
them
the
serpent
only
lives
upon
the
promises
of
holy
spirits
as
the
souls
of
the
righteous
who
are
dead
are
nourished
by
flowers
perfume
and
incense
the
serpent
is
sent
by
the
departed
souls
of
the
righteous
to
remind
men
of
their
forgotten
promises
but
why
do
i
tell
you
of
our
javanese
beliefs
forgive
me
when
there
is
so
much
besides
that
i
want
to
tell
you
i
deserve
a
fine
scolding
for
my
long
delay
in
writing
in
large
measure
it
was
due
to
indolence
i
am
not
satisfied
with
myself
what
makes
me
so
lazy
and
restless
i
do
not
understand
it
i
am
not
definitely
sick
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
far
from
well
i
am
dull
weary
and
uneasy
nonsense
hypochondria
there
i
must
seize
hold
of
myself
it
is
work
that
i
need
work
that
my
heart
is
in
and
now
comes
my
stupidity
because
i
can
not
work
at
that
which
i
would
i
turn
with
distaste
from
all
other
forms
of
toil
that
is
weakness
i
know
but
i
could
stand

whole
avalanche
of
work

unbearable
trivialities
with
which
my

i
fear
that
it
made
you
both
sad
to
read
my
last
letter
and
it
will
certainly
please
you
now
to
learn
that
though
there
is
no
change
in
outward
conditions
there
is
a
change
in
us
it
is
no
longer
night
in
our
souls
a
great
calm
has
descended
upon
us
and
through
darkness
and
mist
we
see
the
splendid
light
break
which
beckons
us
with
friendly
hands
it
is
the
light
of
our
ideal
we
know
now
that
we
shall
never
be
able
to
cease
from
striving
it
has
grown
to
be
part
of
our
being
of
our
very
existence
it
is
not
only
today
or
yesterday
that
we
have
felt
and
lived
for
our
cause
we
should
have
to
be
given
new
hearts
new
brains
and
new
blood
would
have
to
be
put
into
our
veins
before
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
live
for
anything
else
i
have
thought
and
experienced
all
that
you
wrote
me
long
ago
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
close
association
i
said
many
times
to
the
sisters
i
begged
and
implored
them
to
tear
themselves
loose
from
me
and
not
to
allow
themselves
to
depend
so
wholly
upon
me
for
who
am
i
presumptuous
fool
to
calmly
lead
and
allow
my
little
sisters
to
follow
me
i
am
going
on
strange
unknown
ways
which
will
lead
toward
heaven
but
must
first
take
me
down
into
hell
this
last
much
more
easily
than
the
first
hell
is
near
and
the
way
to
it
is
lighted
but
heaven
is
so
far
off
and
difficult
to
find
yes
say
my
sisters
but
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
could
sow
the
seeds
of
ideas
in
us
so
that
they
would
bear
fruit
unless
the
soil
were
suited
to
them
we
are
going
together
whether
it
be
to
heaven
or
to
hell
my
beautiful
faithful
little
souls
no
they
have
learned
nothing
from
me
for
i
have
always
been
their
pupil
oh
they
have
taught
me
much
we
are
one
in
ideas
and
feelings
everything
has
combined
to
make
us
one
we
have
been
together
all
our
lives
though
you
can
take
away
the
long
years
that
we
lived
together
but
outwardly
and
count
only
these
last
intimate
years
souls
that
have
dwelt
together
for
only
one
moment
in
great
sympathy
can
never
wholly
forget
one
another
but
we
have
dwelt
together
in
complete
harmony
for
years
the
years
have
added
to
the
bond
we
see
the
same
things
hear
the
same
things
day
after
day
and
talk
over
everything
with
one
another
we
take
delight
in
the
same
things
read
books
magazines
and
newspapers
together
discuss
what
we
have
read
and
exchange
opinions
and
ideas
our
parents
see
our
intimacy
with
pleasure
and
encourage
in
every
way
they
are
so
pleased
with
the
idea
that
they
are
sometimes
unjust
to
those
outside
for
the
triple
bond
must
come
before
everything
else
our
protectors
as
you
know
may
marry
us
to
whomsoever
they
will
the
only
circumstances
in
which
they
may
not
compel
our
obedience
is
when
the
candidate
for
our
hand
is
of
a
rank
inferior
to
our
own
parents
may
not
compel
their
daughters
to
marry
a
man
who
is
beneath
them
in
station
that
is
our
only
weapon
against
their
arbitrary
will
the
prospective
bridegroom
has
only
to
go
with
the
father
or
other
male
relative
to
the
panghoeloe
or
some
one
else
of
the
kind
and
the
wedding
is
over
the
girl
may
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
at
the
time
mother
knew
a
woman
who
refused
to
marry
she
said
she
had
rather
die
than
marry
the
man
her
parents
had
chosen
for
her
heaven
was
merciful
three
months
before
the
date
set
for
the
wedding
the
cholera
took
her
away
had
she
lived
no
one
would
have
been
disturbed
in
the
least
by
her
refusal
she
would
have
been
married
out
of
hand
despite
her
protests
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
long
ago
in
old
times
there
were
rebellious
daughters
too
it
has
always
been
preached
to
us
that
it
was
our
duty
to
belong
blindly
to
our
parents
at
the
same
time
it
has
happened
that
when
a
young
woman
submissive
to
their
decree
was
married
and
afterwards
unhappy
they
would
make
sport
of
her
and
say
foolish
one
why
then
did
you
marry
when
you
were
married
you
were
willing
you
wished
to
follow
your
husband
you
must
not
complain
now
when
i
received
your
letter
we
were
about
to
go
to
a
wedding
it
is
not
customary
for
young
girls
to
go
to
weddings
and
sit
among
the
wedding
guests
but
mamma
graciously
gave
us
her
consent
if
the
bride
mother
an
old
friend
of
ours
had
not
pressed
us
to
honour
her
with
our
presence
at
the
great
feast
we
would
have
gladly
stayed
away
before
we
started
from
our
house
we
saw
the
retinue
of
the
bridegroom
going
toward
the
mosque
there
was
a
downpour
of
rain
and
the
carriage
in
which
the
bridegroom
sat
was
closed
as
were
the
other
carriages
which
followed
it
banners
were
streaming
over
the
it
was
a
train
we
were
depressed
by
it
indeed
it
made
us
think
of
a
funeral
procession
when
we
came
to
the
home
of
the
bride
we
found
her
sitting
in
front
of
the
quade
canopy
waiting
for
the
bridegroom
father
went
with
us
too
we
sat
on
the
ground
close
by
the
door
the
eldest
between
the
two
little
sisters
incense
and
the
perfume
of
flowers
filled
the
room
gamelan
music
and
the
soft
buzzing
of
voices
reached
us
from
outside
gamelan
broke
into
a
song
of
welcome
the
bridegroom
was
coming
two
women
seized
the
bride
by
the
arms
lifted
her
up
and
led
her
to
meet
the
bridegroom
who
was
also
being
led
toward
her
by
two
persons
after
a
few
steps
they
are
opposite
each
other
and
bride
and
bridegroom
give
each
one
to
the
other
a
sirrih
leaf
a
few
steps
nearer
and
both
sink
to
the
ground
the
bride
prostrates
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
as
a
symbol
of
her
subjection
to
the
man
flat
before
him
she
makes
a
respectful
sembah
and
humbly
kisses
his
foot
again
a
submissive
sembah
and
both
rise
and
go
hand
in
hand
and
seat
themselves
under
the
canopy
joe
joe
whispered
kleintje
to
me
with
dancing
eyes
and
a
roguish
twist
to
her
mouth
he
i
should
go
wild
if
i
could
only
see
a
bridal
pair
come
smiling
to
meet
each
other
and
hand
the
sirrih
leaf
with
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
of
course
that
would
have
to
be
among
the
younger
generation
a
bridal
pair
who
had
known
each
other
beforehand
would
not
that
be
fine
eh
joe
will
it
ever
happen
i
should
go
crazy
with
delight
if
i
could
ever
see
it
it
will
come
i
said
mechanically
and
smiled
but
in
that
room
i
felt
as
though
my
heart
were
being
pierced
with
a
dagger
and
there
at
my
side
with
face
beaming
and
dancing
eyes
sat
my
sister
a
few
days
ago
i
opened
a
book
by
chance
it
happened
to
be
multatuli
and
the
first
thing
i
read
was
thugater
i
still
seem
to
see
the
words
before
my
eyes
father
said
to
her
that
to
know
and
to
understand
and
to
desire
was
a
sin
for
a
girl
certainly
the
great
genial
writer
had
little
idea
when
he
wrote
that
what
a
deep
impression
it
would
make
some
day
upon
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
people
whom
he
loved
and
for
whose
welfare
he
sacrificed
so
much
there
was
a
woman
of
the
people
who
became
wife
number
two
of
a
native
official
the
first
wife
who
was
not
quite
right
in
her
head
after
a
little
went
away
from
him
leaving
behind
a
whole
troop
of
children
number
two
became
the
official
wife
and
was
a
painstaking
loving
mother
to
her
she
was
very
diligent
and
worked
hard
to
save
something
from
the
income
of
her
husband
so
that
later
they
would
be
able
to
educate
his
children
and
it
was
thanks
to
her
that
the
sons
turned
out
so
well
now
i
come
to
the
thanks
once
when
her
husband
had
gone
to
the
city
he
came
back
home
late
at
night
and
called
his
wife
outside
a
guest
had
come
with
him
for
whom
she
must
care
and
make
ready
a
room
the
guest
was
a
young
woman
and
when
her
husband
told
her
that
the
guest
was
his
wife
and
that
she
his
older
wife
must
thenceforth
share
everything
with
her
at
first
she
was
stunned
for
she
did
not
understand
she
only
stood
and
looked
at
him
but
when
the
frightful
truth
penetrated
to
her
brain
she
sank
without
a
single
word
to
the
ground
when
she
came
to
herself
again
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
asked
standing
for
a
writing
of
divorcement
from
her
husband
at
first
he
did
not
wish
to
understand
her
but
she
persisted
till
at
last
he
yielded
and
gave
her
the
requested
paper
that
very
night
she
went
out
of
the
house
on
foot
through
fields
and
forests
to
her
parents
house
in
the
city
how
she
got
there
she
did
not
know
when
she
could
think
again
she
was
with
her
family
and
they
told
her
that
she
had
been
ill
for
a
long
time
later
after
she
had
recovered
she
looked
at
the
letter
which
she
had
forced
from
her
husband
on
that
terrible
night
and
saw
that
she
was
really
not
divorced
at
all
the
letter
merely
contained
her
description
and
the
information
that
she
had
run
away
from
him
he
had
no
idea
in
the
world
of
giving
her
back
her
freedom
later
she
became
reconciled
to
him
the
other
wife
left
the
house
and
went
to
live
in
another
dwelling
while
she
resumed
her
old
rule
of
the
household
on
that
frightful
night
she
had
sworn
a
solemn
oath
she
swallowed
dust
and
vowed
never
never
to
raise
her
hand
to
deprive
another
of
her
rights
she
had
done
it
herself
ignorantly
as
a
child
when
she
was
fourteen
years
of
age
her
parents
had
married
her
to
her
husband
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
she
belonged
only
to
her
parents
who
used
often
to
beat
her
at
their
pleasure
she
knew
now
what
a
hell
pain
it
was
to
be
pressed
from
the
side
of
a
husband
by
another
she
has
remained
true
to
her
oath
not
long
ago
her
husband
married
a
niece
to
some
one
who
already
had
a
wife
she
defied
the
wrath
of
her
husband
and
refused
persistently
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
wedding
preparations
and
the
wedding
was
not
held
in
her
house
we
know
her
very
well
and
have
great
respect
for
her
she
has
made
herself
what
she
is
by
her
own
efforts
she
has
worked
hard
and
improved
herself
though
she
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
study
she
has
taught
herself
to
read
and
has
worked
her
way
through
several
books
with
profit
we
are
sometimes
astonished
at
her
conversation
the
result
of
deep
thinking
and
also
of
a
sound
understanding
she
is
truly
an
unusual
woman
it
would
be
well
if
there
were
more
like
her
who
has
had
neither
education
nor
opportunities
but
who
thinks
and
feels
as
we
because
she
has
known
suffering
her
history
is
not
unique
there
are
many
like
it
but
where
shall
i
end
if
i
once
begin
to
tell
you
of
the
misery
of
the
native
women
every
one
whose
eyes
are
not
blind
and
whose
ears
are
not
deaf
knows
what
goes
on
in
our
world
pluck
the
heart
from
our
bodies
and
the
brains
from
our
head
if
you
wish
to
change
us
long
before
you
quoted
from
zangwill
dreams
of
the
ghetto
to
me
kleintje
said
almost
the
same
thing
though
of
course
in
different
words
we
were
eating
tarts
or
something
of
the
kind
when
little
sister
came
running
up
and
wished
to
have
some
too
there
was
no
clean
plate
for
her
and
kardinah
said
eat
off
joe
plate
and
then
you
will
become
clever
like
her
whereupon
kleintje
said
solemnly
no
i
will
not
do
it
i
want
to
remain
stupid
to
be
clever
is
not
to
be
happy
not
for
every
one
it
is
a
misfortune
to
be
able
to
think
and
not
to
be
able
to
act
to
be
able
to
know
to
feel
and
to
wish
and
not
to
be
free
i
want
to
be
only
stupid
once
when
i
was
distraught
with
trouble
and
leaned
against
the
wall
motionless
with
wide
open
eyes
that
saw
nothing
but
only
stared
at
the
light
a
cry
of
sorrow
smote
my
ears
and
brought
me
back
to
a
sense
of
reality
father
leaned
over
me
his
arms
were
around
me
though
his
face
was
turned
away
do
not
give
way
like
that
ni
have
patience
oh
my
father
why
have
you
not
listened
to
the
voice
of
your
own
heart
why
have
you
heeded
the
voice
of
the
world
to
mevrouw
abendanon
servant
of
religion
in
charge
of
a
mosque
grounds
in
front
of
a
regent
palace
usually
square
in
shape
and
surrounded
by
trees
sometimes
with
a
group
of
trees
in
the
center
sirrih
the
leaf
of
a
vine
a
paste
composed
of
lime
gamlier
and
betel
nut
is
spread
upon
this
and
eaten
by
the
javanese
women
it
is
customary
for
bride
and
bridegroom
to
present
it
to
each
other
at
weddings
the
custom
is
of
ancient
origin
xxix
we
do
not
want
to
sail
any
longer
upon
a
weak
ship
something
must
be
done
for
this
great
this
unhappy
cause
we
should
be
satisfied
if
only
the
attention
of
the
intelligent
world
were
fastened
upon
it
many
times
have
i
talked
with
women
both
with
those
of
the
nobles
and
those
of
the
people
about
the
idea
of
an
independent
free
girl
who
could
earn
her
own
living
and
from
each
one
comes
the
answer
there
must
be
some
one
who
sets
the
example
we
are
convinced
that
if
one
has
but
the
courage
to
begin
many
will
follow
her
there
must
always
be
a
beginning
one
must
go
first
to
show
the
way
and
the
example
must
be
good
each
one
waits
for
the
other
no
one
dares
to
be
first
the
parents
too
wait
for
one
another
to
see
which
one
will
have
the
moral
courage
to
allow
a
daughter
to
become
independent
and
self
supporting
to
stand
by
herself
we
know
a
regent
daughter
our
own
age
who
is
also
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
of
freedom
she
is
crazy
to
study
she
speaks
excellent
dutch
and
has
read
a
great
deal
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
regent
of
koetoardjo
there
are
two
great
girls
charming
children
we
are
very
fond
of
them
i
know
from
a
teacher
an
acquaintance
of
ours
that
the
older
girl
is
crazy
to
study
she
has
told
me
herself
that
she
is
very
anxious
to
go
to
europe
the
second
sister
also
is
a
dear
clever
child
a
few
years
ago
they
were
at
our
house
on
a
visit
when
they
first
came
they
began
to
draw
and
paint
with
us
and
now
the
younger
one
paints
very
well
their
father
has
a
great
respect
for
an
educated
woman
we
know
another
one
of
his
daughters
who
is
married
she
speaks
no
dutch
but
she
has
gone
further
than
the
others
she
has
a
great
admiration
for
the
free
independent
european
woman
she
would
think
it
ideal
if
we
could
have
the
same
conditions
in
our
native
world
another
regent
daughter
has
been
here
she
is
a
sundanese
girl
she
does
not
speak
a
word
of
javanese
but
she
was
brought
up
with
europeans
so
we
talked
in
dutch
the
first
question
that
she
asked
me
was
how
many
mothers
have
you
i
turned
to
her
in
pained
astonishment
and
she
went
on
do
not
be
shocked
you
know
that
i
have
mothers
and
there
are
of
us
i
do
not
know
the
majority
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
i
am
the
youngest
and
never
knew
my
father
he
died
before
i
was
born
is
not
that
deeply
deeply
sad
in
the
preanger
girls
of
noble
birth
are
free
to
choose
their
own
husbands
and
many
of
them
even
know
the
man
to
whom
they
are
betrothed
the
young
people
meet
one
another
and
become
engaged
after
the
european
manner
blessed
land
and
yet
there
is
a
girl
a
of
a
regent
her
parents
are
dead
who
has
had
a
splendid
bringing
up
and
if
her
teacher
is
a
good
judge
must
be
a
wonder
of
learning
she
plays
the
piano
well
etc
she
became
engaged
after
the
european
manner
and
married
some
one
who
had
many
wives
and
a
whole
troop
of
children
some
of
them
full
grown
i
knew
one
of
her
a
charming
little
woman
who
speaks
dutch
and
is
the
mother
of
a
two
year
old
child
she
was
seventeen
years
old
a
year
or
two
younger
than
her
she
told
me
that
she
chose
her
husband
herself
and
was
very
happy
the
idea
of
publishing
all
that
i
think
and
feel
about
conditions
among
our
mohammedan
women
has
been
with
me
for
a
long
time
i
thought
of
putting
it
into
a
book
in
the
form
of
letters
between
two
daughters
a
sundanese
and
a
javanese
already
i
have
written
several
letters
but
i
shall
not
go
on
with
it
at
present
it
will
be
perhaps
some
years
before
i
can
finish
it
but
i
shall
not
give
up
the
idea
that
too
was
suggested
by
mijnheer
the
great
difficulty
is
that
father
would
not
allow
me
to
publish
such
a
book
it
is
good
for
you
to
be
versed
in
the
dutch
language
says
father
but
you
must
not
make
that
an
excuse
for
telling
your
inmost
thoughts
we
girls
must
have
no
ideas
we
have
but
to
think
that
everything
is
good
as
we
find
it
and
to
say
yes
and
amen
to
everything
i
was
asked
a
few
years
ago
by
a
dutch
authoress
of
reputation
editor
of
a
woman
journal
with
whom
i
correspond
and
whom
i
like
very
much
for
permission
to
publish
a
letter
in
which
i
had
touched
upon
these
questions
the
publication
of
private
opinions
such
as
mine
would
be
good
for
the
cause
she
thought
she
would
have
kept
my
identity
a
secret
name
dwelling
place
everything
would
have
been
concealed
only
those
places
would
have
been
mentioned
wherein
i
allude
to
certain
peculiar
customs
of
my
country
the
letter
was
sent
back
to
java
so
that
it
could
be
shown
to
father
he
said
that
it
must
not
be
published
later
perhaps
i
knew
what
that
later
meant
it
meant
that
when
i
should
have
become
harmless
by
having
the
raden
adjeng
changed
to
raden
ajoe
lately
we
had
the
same
thing
over
again
mevrouw
ter
horst
founder
and
editor
of
the
indian
woman
journal
sent
me
her
paper
she
knows
personally
much
about
the
life
of
the
native
woman
and
has
great
sympathy
for
the
well
born
girls
in
the
vorstenlanden
who
are
given
away
like
so
many
presents
she
wanted
me
to
begin
a
series
of
articles
talks
between
two
regents
daughters
secrecy
should
it
be
necessary
was
absolutely
assured
with
her
she
also
thinks
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
write
sketches
of
the
life
around
us
i
gave
the
letter
to
father
hoping
for
his
permission
which
was
again
denied
i
must
not
tell
my
ideas
too
early
always
it
is
later
the
heer
boes
of
probolingo
wrote
to
father
and
asked
if
i
might
write
some
articles
for
his
paper
nederlandsche
a
periodical
for
natives
the
heer
boes
asked
for
a
reply
and
sent
me
a
list
of
subjects
that
he
would
like
to
have
treated
such
as
native
education
for
girls
native
art
useful
native
institutions
at
that
time
we
had
gone
to
batavia
so
many
things
came
up
after
that
i
could
not
write
i
was
in
such
trouble
that
my
pen
refused
to
go
and
i
hoped
that
each
day
would
be
better
than
the
one
that
had
gone
before
but
the
next
day
would
be
just
the
same
and
i
would
tear
up
what
i
had
tried
to
write
that
was
stupid
but
i
was
beside
myself
with
waiting
and
delay
i
was
in
despair
i
was
to
be
allowed
to
write
only
nonsense
earnest
things
i
must
not
touch
upon
then
i
began
to
think
that
if
i
did
write
upon
serious
subjects
should
have
the
whole
native
world
against
me
if
i
became
a
teacher
the
people
would
not
trust
their
children
to
me
i
should
be
called
crazy
the
idea
of
serving
our
cause
with
my
pen
is
so
dear
to
me
and
yet
picture
to
yourself
a
school
without
children
a
teacher
without
pupils
but
we
have
not
gone
as
far
as
that
we
must
have
education
first
for
that
we
must
first
obtain
father
permission
and
then
we
have
to
present
our
petition
to
the
governor
general
we
must
not
count
too
much
upon
the
success
of
our
suit
and
if
it
should
fail
o
god
what
then
there
remains
only
one
thing
for
us
to
become
accoucheuses
we
should
then
have
to
give
up
our
hope
of
being
examples
and
of
lighting
the
way
for
others
for
then
we
could
be
of
service
only
to
a
few
but
we
think
that
would
be
far
better
than
just
to
be
apothecaries
apprentices
or
something
of
that
kind
work
in
which
our
lives
should
be
so
barren
so
empty
we
should
be
living
only
for
ourselves
and
we
want
to
live
for
the
good
of
society
as
a
whole
i
have
information
about
the
government
school
of
obstetrics
at
amsterdam
where
one
can
be
educated
for
that
profession
absolutely
free
of
charge
we
should
have
to
have
the
help
of
hector
treub
the
course
lasts
two
years
how
should
we
be
able
to
get
to
europe
we
do
not
know
some
way
must
be
found
we
will
not
go
into
that
until
we
have
exhausted
every
means
in
our
power
towards
the
carrying
out
of
our
other
plans
alas
if
we
could
but
get
into
communication
with
our
own
educated
young
men
men
like
abdulli
rivai
and
others
and
win
their
sympathy
for
our
cause
when
will
the
time
come
when
boys
and
girls
men
and
women
shall
look
upon
one
another
as
equal
human
beings
as
comrades
as
it
is
now
bah
how
we
women
are
degraded
at
every
turn
again
and
again
to
mevrouw
abendanon
vorstenlanden
princes
countries
name
given
by
the
hollanders
to
the
central
province
of
java
comprising
the
residences
of
soerakarta
and
djokjakarta
it
is
a
principality
and
is
divided
between
two
native
princes
the
soeshoeman
of
soerakarta
and
the
sultan
of
djokjakaarta
whose
power
has
been
so
reduced
by
the
concessions
which
they
have
been
forced
to
make
to
the
dutch
government
that
only
its
shadow
remains
this
semblance
of
power
is
encouraged
by
the
hollanders
for
diplomatic
reasons
though
the
sultan
is
virtually
a
prisoner
in
his
own
palace
soerakarta
and
djokjakarta
form
the
last
remnant
of
the
ancient
hindu
kingdom
of
mataram
to
which
originally
the
name
java
was
given
xxx
when
we
were
in
samarang
our
eldest
sister
came
over
to
see
us
sister
sister
was
all
that
she
said
when
she
had
seen
me
the
arms
that
were
thrown
around
me
trembled
and
her
eyes
were
rilled
with
tears
we
were
silent
we
understood
each
other
at
last
we
have
found
our
sister
at
last
after
years
we
have
gained
her
understanding
and
respect
that
gives
us
new
courage
because
at
first
she
was
very
conservative
and
was
opposed
violently
to
every
innovation
formerly
it
was
not
the
custom
to
send
children
to
school
now
it
is
an
everyday
occurrence
but
when
one
has
a
little
matter
of
children
can
one
educate
them
all
the
question
is
never
raised
that
one
has
not
the
right
to
awaken
life
when
one
can
not
maintain
life
alas
how
simple
i
am
i
thought
to
myself
that
if
i
did
something
terrible
which
would
call
down
universal
scorn
upon
my
head
if
every
one
passed
me
by
and
i
were
showered
with
insults
would
father
and
would
mother
turn
away
from
me
no
they
would
not
i
should
still
be
their
child
and
have
a
place
in
their
hearts
all
the
time
we
were
sitting
quietly
here
in
our
room
sewing
on
kleintje
clothes
she
will
have
nothing
that
a
strange
hand
has
touched
we
must
do
everything
for
her
ourselves
the
door
opened
a
little
way
and
father
came
from
behind
it
to
stroke
the
rebellious
head
that
surged
with
so
many
unruly
thoughts
after
four
weeks
sister
will
be
with
us
no
longer
you
will
all
miss
me
very
much
i
know
it
she
said
in
everything
always
we
three
have
been
together
to
mevrouw
abendanon
when
some
one
does
something
unkind
to
me
it
makes
my
blood
boil
i
grow
very
angry
but
afterwards
something
like
joy
comes
to
me
i
am
glad
that
it
is
the
other
person
who
has
injured
me
and
not
i
that
have
hurt
him
for
then
it
is
i
that
should
be
base
and
if
i
were
troubled
it
would
be
because
i
had
been
guilty
and
injured
another
unjustly
forgive
me
for
having
taken
so
long
to
write
after
the
departure
of
our
darling
our
heart
and
soul
sister
i
could
not
write
sister
went
from
here
to
her
new
home
on
the
of
january
god
grant
that
our
little
girl
may
be
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
for
a
young
pure
and
innocent
creature
to
be
in
this
world
you
know
how
we
three
have
always
clung
together
and
that
she
has
been
our
darling
because
she
is
not
strong
and
needed
our
care
before
her
marriage
we
thought
so
much
about
the
coming
separation
but
when
the
great
blow
fell
we
felt
nothing
we
were
so
dismally
calm
we
were
not
capable
of
thought
we
saw
her
go
with
dry
eyes
annie
glazer
our
companion
who
came
on
a
visit
reminded
us
so
much
of
sister
one
evening
she
played
on
the
piano
the
pieces
that
sister
had
loved
most
and
under
the
spell
of
her
music
the
melted
from
our
hearts
but
with
the
warmth
the
pain
too
came
back
thank
god
that
we
could
feel
again
thank
god
thank
god
we
said
in
spite
of
the
pain
for
those
who
can
not
feel
pain
are
not
capable
either
of
feeling
joy
she
has
gone
far
away
from
us
and
we
can
not
realize
that
she
will
be
with
us
no
more
our
kleintje
our
own
little
girl
we
see
her
in
everything
she
is
with
us
always
only
we
can
not
prattle
aloud
to
her
as
formerly
we
can
only
do
that
in
our
thoughts
it
is
still
so
strange
to
us
that
we
must
take
a
pen
and
paper
to
tell
her
something
or
other
kleintje
our
little
one
have
you
really
gone
away
from
us
ah
dear
sister
be
happy
in
your
new
life
and
shed
happiness
around
you
there
just
as
you
did
here
when
you
bound
all
our
hearts
so
fast
to
yours
there
is
a
young
man
with
a
very
clever
head
and
at
the
same
time
of
high
position
who
does
not
know
us
personally
but
who
has
much
sympathy
for
our
struggle
and
takes
as
much
interest
in
it
as
if
he
were
our
own
brother
we
correspond
with
him
and
later
he
is
coming
himself
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
sisters
he
is
so
different
from
all
the
other
men
that
we
know
i
read
once
that
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
was
a
noble
man
heart
i
understand
now
truly
a
noble
heart
is
the
most
priceless
thing
in
the
world
it
is
so
rare
we
are
happy
because
we
have
found
such
an
one
sister
roekmini
thinks
of
you
often
and
has
such
a
high
opinion
of
you
she
is
a
fine
child
so
good
so
faithful
you
would
like
her
i
know
if
you
could
meet
her
but
you
do
know
her
already
through
me
do
you
not
when
i
was
sick
i
tried
to
make
her
write
to
you
but
she
would
not
because
it
might
make
you
uneasy
when
she
was
with
me
and
i
was
so
very
sick
i
thought
to
myself
it
was
very
discouraging
here
is
some
one
who
glows
with
enthusiasm
for
a
noble
cause
who
longs
to
be
strong
and
brave
to
overcome
mountains
and
see
now
she
lies
helpless
powerless
if
some
one
picked
her
up
and
threw
her
into
a
well
she
could
make
no
resistance
because
she
would
be
wholly
defenceless
now
for
the
first
time
we
understand
what
de
genestet
means
in
his
what
we
wish
and
will
and
strive
for
we
pray
high
powers
to
grant
for
free
man
you
do
not
make
yourself
and
your
own
life
the
eagle
flight
is
always
fast
enclosed
the
almighty
bends
our
will
our
strength
as
the
wind
bends
the
wheat
still
lay
the
ground
out
plan
your
castles
mark
the
way
you
wish
to
travel
the
earth
is
wide
and
beautiful
choose
your
fate
and
seek
your
way
by
your
own
light
god
watches
all
the
while
and
guides
your
unaware
and
the
same
poet
has
given
us
much
comfort
in
dark
difficult
days
peter
augustus
de
genestet
noted
poet
born
at
amsterdam
in
and
died
at
the
age
of
xxxi
we
know
how
to
be
merry
and
playful
too
just
to
be
young
the
sunday
after
we
got
your
dear
letter
we
went
down
to
the
shore
and
last
sunday
as
well
we
were
there
we
thought
of
you
and
we
spoke
of
you
if
you
could
only
have
been
with
us
to
look
at
the
wild
play
of
the
waves
and
at
the
wonderful
colours
which
stretched
before
us
at
there
was
a
strong
wind
more
than
once
our
hair
was
blown
down
and
we
had
to
hold
on
to
our
clothes
to
keep
them
from
flying
away
there
was
not
only
life
in
the
trees
and
in
the
water
there
was
life
in
the
girls
who
ran
up
and
down
through
the
waves
we
had
such
a
delightful
time
our
voices
rose
above
the
noise
of
the
water
we
laughed
aloud
those
were
the
teachers
the
stately
princesses
who
ran
and
sported
in
the
waves
with
blown
hair
and
blown
garments
we
were
so
happy
so
young
and
so
gay
our
attendants
stood
by
staring
and
gaping
with
wide
open
mouths
the
next
morning
we
went
again
to
the
shore
the
sea
was
no
longer
blustering
the
boundless
stretch
of
water
was
calm
there
were
only
little
ripples
playing
upon
the
surface
and
the
danced
in
and
out
among
them
like
brilliants
we
went
into
the
sea
the
ground
was
even
there
were
no
pebbles
no
no
slime
we
went
far
out
till
the
water
reached
our
chins
the
baboe
on
the
shore
grew
frightened
we
could
no
longer
understand
her
but
she
ran
up
and
down
like
a
mad
woman
waving
her
arms
and
calling
us
back
we
only
laughed
at
her
distress
in
the
distance
she
saw
our
heads
sway
around
as
we
danced
and
our
voices
sounded
over
the
water
raised
in
a
merry
little
song
when
we
went
back
to
the
house
we
took
with
us
a
lively
feeling
of
hunger
you
may
be
sure
after
we
had
eaten
ravenously
annie
sat
down
to
the
piano
out
of
the
fullness
of
her
heart
she
played
a
danklied
and
we
sang
with
her
it
was
as
though
we
had
grown
half
elf
now
quickly
to
work
in
the
back
gallery
our
sewing
stood
ready
we
sat
at
one
table
and
worked
busily
but
it
was
not
only
the
fingers
that
hurried
along
our
tongues
were
not
idle
and
we
were
chattering
and
laughing
and
singing
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
time
had
gone
by
and
we
must
sit
again
at
the
table
at
midday
we
took
a
little
walk
and
wandered
back
to
the
shore
after
our
walk
if
it
is
not
too
dark
we
usually
drink
tea
in
the
garden
among
the
shrubs
and
flowers
and
under
the
blue
sky
where
after
awhile
a
few
stars
and
the
pale
gold
moon
come
out
when
we
go
in
we
have
music
or
we
read
together
when
annie
plays
the
piano
we
sit
by
her
and
sew
or
write
for
it
is
a
delight
to
be
able
to
work
while
there
is
music
the
work
goes
so
easily
cooking
is
also
on
our
program
we
practise
that
every
day
after
the
rice
meal
you
and
your
husband
must
come
to
see
us
and
rest
here
from
that
oppressive
batavia
can
you
not
come
now
we
shall
expect
you
then
you
can
amuse
yourselves
with
our
kind
of
life
which
is
so
restful
so
still
so
quiet
and
so
peaceful
we
will
take
care
of
you
and
we
shall
have
the
help
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
and
of
the
birds
that
greet
us
every
morning
with
their
songs
come
dear
friends
come
and
find
fresh
life
in
our
modest
still
little
place
of
the
wedding
here
i
shall
only
say
that
sister
was
a
lovely
bride
she
was
married
in
wajang
costume
and
looked
beautiful
in
the
evening
at
the
reception
she
looked
like
a
fairy
princess
from
the
thousand
and
one
nights
she
had
on
a
golden
crown
with
a
veil
hanging
down
behind
it
was
a
new
idea
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
be
imitated
resident
sijthoff
was
much
interested
in
seeing
sister
for
the
last
time
as
a
young
girl
he
stayed
through
everything
he
would
have
liked
to
press
her
hand
in
farewell
but
that
might
not
be
he
could
only
greet
her
with
his
eyes
as
though
carved
in
stone
she
sat
straight
as
an
arrow
before
the
glittering
golden
canopy
her
head
was
held
proudly
high
and
her
eyes
were
looking
straight
ahead
as
though
staring
at
the
future
that
was
so
soon
to
be
unravelled
before
her
there
were
none
of
the
usual
tears
but
even
strangers
were
affected
only
she
and
her
two
sisters
were
calm
our
emotions
had
been
lulled
to
sleep
by
the
gamelan
music
by
incense
and
the
perfume
of
flowers
we
were
unmoved
we
had
looked
forward
to
our
parting
as
to
something
frightful
so
every
one
was
astonished
we
are
still
stared
at
very
hard
people
are
anxious
to
see
how
we
hold
up
under
the
strain
we
talked
to
the
resident
of
our
plans
that
very
evening
imagine
our
speaking
at
the
end
of
a
crowded
feast
about
a
cause
which
is
so
earnest
and
so
sacred
but
it
was
our
only
opportunity
to
talk
to
him
alone
and
we
had
to
make
the
most
of
it
alone
all
around
us
there
were
people
and
still
more
people
surrounded
by
evergreens
and
flowers
with
a
shimmer
of
silk
and
the
glitter
of
gold
and
jewels
before
our
eyes
amid
the
buzzing
of
a
thousand
voices
in
a
very
sea
of
light
we
sat
there
at
midnight
with
champagne
glasses
in
our
hands
to
speak
of
grave
matters
we
were
afraid
that
he
would
laugh
at
us
or
at
least
think
us
silly
but
we
did
not
let
him
frighten
us
he
talked
first
with
me
and
then
with
roekmini
separately
to
make
sure
that
our
ideas
were
our
own
and
not
borrowed
from
each
other
i
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
an
important
one
when
you
see
your
friend
ask
him
if
among
the
mohammedans
there
are
laws
of
majority
as
among
you
or
should
i
write
myself
to
his
excellency
for
enlightenment
there
are
some
things
i
should
be
so
glad
to
know
about
the
rights
and
duties
or
better
still
the
laws
concerning
the
mohammedan
wife
and
daughter
how
strange
for
me
to
ask
it
makes
me
ashamed
that
we
do
not
know
ourselves
we
know
so
bitterly
little
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xxxii
the
influence
of
blood
can
not
be
denied
i
attach
a
certain
value
to
the
descent
of
every
one
around
me
and
i
have
an
idea
that
i
shall
be
blessed
by
the
ancestors
of
those
persons
whom
i
love
and
honour
i
am
eager
to
read
the
books
you
have
sent
me
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
understand
them
easily
do
you
not
think
me
a
little
stupid
i
am
only
a
great
child
who
longs
very
much
to
be
loved
and
who
longs
too
for
knowledge
and
understanding
understanding
is
a
very
difficult
art
is
it
not
so
dearest
but
when
one
understands
one
judges
mercifully
and
one
forgives
it
is
friday
evening
gamelan
evening
our
souls
are
wafted
up
to
the
blue
heaven
of
our
fancy
by
the
sweet
serene
tones
that
are
borne
to
us
on
the
evening
wind
from
the
pendopo
let
us
dream
as
long
as
it
is
possible
if
there
were
no
dreams
what
would
life
be
we
have
taken
away
all
the
little
trifles
and
ornaments
from
our
room
it
is
no
longer
the
joyful
girls
room
where
we
dreamed
dreams
where
we
wept
thought
felt
rejoiced
and
struggled
only
our
remains
unchanged
and
our
old
friends
smile
at
us
still
in
their
friendly
confident
and
encouraging
way
one
of
our
best
friends
who
is
no
longer
ornamental
because
he
has
grown
shows
very
plainly
whenever
the
door
is
opened
our
dear
true
old
friend
many
people
would
turn
up
their
noses
at
him
but
we
love
him
because
he
has
never
left
us
but
has
rejoiced
with
us
in
happy
days
and
through
dark
troubled
ones
he
has
comforted
and
supported
us
he
is
de
genestet
he
has
been
such
a
consolation
to
us
of
late
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xxxiii
do
you
know
who
has
painted
so
many
wajangs
for
us
it
is
one
of
our
gamelan
players
the
art
of
painting
is
part
of
the
air
in
japara
little
urchins
buffalo
boys
draw
excellent
wajangs
in
the
sand
on
the
walls
on
bridges
on
the
supports
of
bridges
the
wall
behind
our
house
is
always
covered
with
wajang
figures
all
the
bridge
supports
erected
today
are
covered
with
them
tomorrow
drawn
with
charcoal
or
with
a
little
piece
of
by
naked
dirty
little
apes
favored
land
our
japara
you
do
not
know
how
proud
we
are
of
our
dear
quiet
place
the
grave
of
the
sultan
of
mantangan
is
half
an
hour
ride
or
somewhat
more
from
here
there
is
a
whole
connected
narrative
about
the
grave
for
it
is
a
holy
tomb
when
the
sultan
came
back
from
china
a
chinese
followed
him
and
lies
buried
in
the
same
place
over
his
grave
there
is
a
patje
tree
miraculous
powers
are
ascribed
to
this
tree
barren
women
who
would
gladly
have
a
child
go
there
and
take
the
sultan
flowers
and
incense
wafers
when
a
patje
fruit
falls
upon
the
grave
of
the
chinaman
the
woman
must
take
it
away
make
it
into
a
stew
and
eat
it
her
wish
will
then
be
granted
we
have
been
told
the
names
of
persons
who
had
obtained
their
wishes
in
this
way
you
see
that
the
javanese
are
a
superstitious
people
fond
of
myths
and
fairy
tales
it
is
said
that
the
children
with
which
the
sultan
of
mantangan
blesses
the
childless
will
all
be
girls
poor
childless
ones
we
shall
have
to
look
for
a
holy
tomb
that
will
bless
the
world
with
boys
for
there
are
all
too
many
women
in
the
world
it
was
uphill
work
to
make
our
artists
carve
wajang
dolls
they
were
frightened
to
death
for
fear
the
wajang
spirits
would
be
angry
with
them
father
assured
them
that
he
would
take
all
responsibility
that
all
consequences
would
be
upon
his
own
head
and
that
the
anger
and
wrath
of
the
spirits
would
smite
him
alone
the
and
not
the
workmen
who
had
merely
carried
out
his
will
it
was
most
difficult
to
take
a
photograph
in
the
kampong
a
superstition
says
that
one
shortens
one
own
life
when
one
allows
a
photograph
to
be
taken
and
that
a
photographer
is
a
great
sinner
all
the
portraits
that
he
makes
will
demand
their
lives
of
him
in
the
after
life
to
mevrouw

xxxiv
i
have
already
written
you
about
my
sister
in
a
former
letter
it
is
such
a
great
loss
we
miss
our
heart
and
soul
sister
all
the
time
happily
we
have
already
had
encouraging
letters
from
her
she
is
such
a
dear
noble
child
she
is
worth
more
than
the
other
two
of
us
put
together
she
likes
her
new
home
and
has
met
with
much
kindness
from
every
one
her
new
family
took
her
by
the
hand
and
wherever
she
went
she
found
cordiality
and
sympathy
from
europeans
as
well
as
from
her
own
people
you
know
already
from
the
marriage
announcement
that
was
sent
you
that
her
husband
is
patih
that
is
one
of
the
highest
ranks
in
our
native
official
world
besides
our
is
heir
to
a
throne
when
his
father
ceases
to
reign
he
will
of
course
succeed
him
as
the
wife
of
a
regent
sister
will
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
for
the
education
of
women
much
more
than
we
will
ever
be
able
to
accomplish
we
have
great
hopes
that
her
husband
will
support
her
at
least
he
was
much
in
favour
of
the
plans
of
the
heer
abendanon
he
is
devoted
to
his
little
wife
has
a
cheerful
energetic
disposition
and
a
sympathetic
heart
he
maintains
a
whole
multitude
of
poor
families
that
is
pleasant
do
you
not
think
so
but
many
javanese
do
that
they
have
much
consideration
for
their
poor
neighbours
there
is
hardly
a
single
native
chief
who
has
not
one
or
more
poor
families
living
in
his
house
or
on
his
support
outside
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
india
is
noted
for
its
hospitality
are
you
not
satisfied
now
about
sister
too
she
is
only
discouraged
because
people
expect
too
much
of
her
she
is
like
her
older
sister
who
never
feels
her
littleness
so
much
as
when
a
certain
person
in
holland
amsterdam
sets
her
too
much
in
the
sun
truly
stella
you
must
not
do
that
i
shall
be
too
much
of
a
disappointment
to
you
when
the
happiest
of
all
happy
stars
brings
me
to
you
you
have
much
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
of
my
character
and
of
my
intellect
they
are
if
i
speak
the
honest
truth
not
worth
a
dubbeltje
but
you
will
never
be
disappointed
in
one
thing
and
that
is
in
my
warm
affection
for
you
lately
i
had
a
letter
from
an
old
gentleman
who
had
great
ideas
about
my
gentle
courage
and
sweet
disposition
and
my
skill
in
the
dutch
language
i
smiled
mournfully
when
i
read
it
and
thought
to
myself
if
you
but
knew
yesterday
we
received
letters
from
holland
and
i
said
to
myself
girl
hold
up
your
head
this
will
not
be
the
only
disappointment
that
life
will
bring
you
you
may
as
well
realize
that
the
future
has
a
whole
multitude
of
them
stored
in
her
lap
for
you
and
yet
i
am
in
no
wise
cast
down
life
itself
teaches
one
to
be
cold
and
unfeeling
and
now
about
the
proposition
from
mejuffrouw
van
der
meij
in
the
first
place
i
thank
you
heartily
my
true
comrade
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
i
thank
you
too
for
sending
me
belang
en
recht
i
went
to
father
with
your
letter
and
asked
him
to
read
it
father
will
wait
for
the
coming
of
van
kol
before
he
decides
the
question
i
have
good
hopes
of
his
consent
yes
stella
i
will
but
not
under
my
own
name
i
wish
to
remain
unknown
tell
that
to
mejuffrouw
van
der
meij
but
that
will
not
help
very
much
when
they
learn
here
in
india
of
articles
by
a
javanese
woman
they
will
know
at
once
upon
whom
to
lay
the
blame
it
is
tiresome
i
do
not
like
to
hear
my
work
discussed
especially
as
i
hear
nothing
but
praise
ah
it
is
interesting
for
a
javanese
woman
to
write
in
dutch
that
is
the
whole
of
my
easily
earned
success
but
let
me
take
advantage
of
that
interest
whatever
its
cause
frankly
it
has
its
good
side
too
for
at
least
i
can
obtain
a
hearing
but
how
am
i
to
gain
friends
for
our
cause
by
writing
for
the
public
unless
i
say
things
that
will
make
an
impression
and
will
be
talked
about
till
they
penetrate
to
the
second
chamber
itself
i
have
always
wanted
to
write
something
scathing
that
tells
what
i
feel
but
i
do
not
feel
strong
enough
i
still
lack
experience
i
have
yet
to
see
and
hear
much
and
to
think
over
what
i
have
seen
the
fruit
is
not
yet
ripe
stella
when
it
is
i
shall
no
longer
hesitate
on
account
of
the
difficulties
if
we
should
turn
to
the
queen
it
would
not
be
in
her
official
capacity
and
because
we
wished
to
obtain
the
help
of
the
state
through
royal
intervention
we
should
only
ask
the
princess
for
her
personal
help
if
you
knew
how
proud
we
were
then
you
would
understand
what
a
struggle
it
has
caused
us
to
make
up
our
minds
to
ask
for
assistance
but
as
you
said
when
large
affairs
come
up
small
ones
must
go
to
the
wall
we
set
our
own
pride
aside
before
the
general
good
in
the
present
instance
our
only
chance
of
success
lies
in
asking
for
help
every
one
who
has
met
the
queen
assures
me
that
her
majesty
is
interested
to
the
highest
degree
in
the
welfare
of
her
indian
subjects
and
the
queen
mother
also
takes
a
warm
interest
in
indian
affairs
we
believe
it
we
are
glad
to
believe
it
at
the
time
of
the
woman
exposition
it
was
the
queen
mother
who
sent
her
personal
secretary
to
the
president
of
the
colonial
department
to
enquire
about
our
work
and
her
majesty
asked
the
president
when
he
was
conducting
her
around
to
read
to
her
some
extracts
from
our
letters
i
feel
confident
of
support
from
the
government
and
from
the
queen
if
this
support
does
not
materialize
there
is
only
modjowarno
left
but
that
is
not
what
our
hearts
wish
do
you
know
whom
i
long
for
in
despondent
unsettled
weather
for
our
friend
who
is
far
away
in
the
wilderness
deep
in
the
heart
of
our
inland
country
living
among
koppensnellers
in
that
distant
place
doing
good
in
many
ways
but
above
all
through
his
knowledge
of
medicine
i
would
fly
to
him
as
a
bird
with
wounded
wings
and
he
would
stroke
my
tired
head
till
my
sorrow
could
be
stilled
and
the
peace
which
he
breathes
would
fall
around
me
but
he
too
is
human
he
too
must
have
his
despondent
moods
his
struggles
stella
stella
if
i
could
only
throw
my
arms
around
you
and
let
my
head
rest
upon
your
heart
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
head
hunters
similar
to
the
dyaks
of
borneo
xxxv
you
are
right
the
separation
from
sister
has
been
a
great
grief
to
us
we
have
been
together
so
long
and
so
intimately
people
were
not
wrong
when
they
said
that
we
three
had
grown
to
be
one
in
thought
and
in
feeling
we
can
not
realize
that
sister
has
really
left
us
the
idea
that
she
has
gone
away
never
to
return
is
unbearable
we
try
to
imagine
that
she
is
only
away
on
a
visit
and
will
be
back
some
day
we
miss
our
kleintje
very
much
but
happiness
will
not
stand
still
this
will
not
be
the
only
hard
parting
we
know
that
many
others
await
us
in
the
future
it
is
wise
from
time
to
time
when
a
tender
strong
bond
binds
and
caresses
the
poor
heart
to
tear
it
asunder
with
our
own
hands
says
de
genestet
but
it
is
easier
said
than
done
do
you
not
find
it
so
we
receive
encouraging
letters
from
little
sister
she
is
happy
and
pleased
with
her
surroundings
that
makes
us
so
thankful
her
happiness
is
our
happiness
and
now
i
shall
try
and
tell
you
something
of
her
wedding
a
native
marriage
entails
a
heavy
burden
upon
the
family
of
the
bride
days
and
weeks
beforehand
the
preparations
for
the
solemnity
are
begun
sister
wedding
was
celebrated
very
quietly
on
account
of
a
death
in
the
family
one
of
our
cousins
who
was
a
sister
of
the
bridegroom
died
shortly
before
the
marriage
poor
creature
she
was
still
such
a
young
thing
and
she
left
little
children
behind
her
you
must
know
that
kleintje
is
married
to
her
own
cousin
his
mother
is
father
sister
he
was
here
with
us
long
ago
but
then
she
was
only
a
schoolgirl
and
no
one
thought
of
an
engagement
though
it
has
happened
that
children
have
been
affianced
and
married
and
later
when
both
were
full
grown
the
marriage
would
be
celebrated
over
again
the
acquaintance
of
sister
and
her
husband
was
renewed
when
the
governor
general
was
at
samarang
it
is
not
customary
among
us
for
young
girls
ever
to
leave
the
house
until
they
follow
a
strange
bridegroom
but
as
i
have
already
told
you
we
have
broken
with
many
traditions
and
can
do
what
others
can
not
on
account
of
the
unusual
freedom
of
our
bringing
up
and
now
we
are
working
to
break
tradition
still
further
no
javanese
girl
must
be
seen
before
her
marriage
she
must
remain
in
the
background
usually
in
her
own
chamber
and
in
december
we
were
at
semarang
with
sister
and
she
went
openly
into
the
shops
to
buy
some
things
which
she
wanted
a
javanese
girl
receives
no
good
wishes
upon
her
engagement
the
subject
is
not
mentioned
before
her
still
less
does
she
mention
it
herself
she
acts
just
as
though
she
knew
nothing
of
it
i
should
like
to
have
read
the
hearts
of
our
fellow
countrywomen
when
they
heard
sister
speak
openly
and
freely
of
her
coming
marriage
a
day
or
two
before
the
wedding
we
commemorated
our
dead
that
is
our
custom
in
the
midst
of
joy
we
always
invoke
the
memory
of
our
dead
there
was
a
sacrificial
meal
during
which
their
blessing
was
asked
for
the
offspring
of
the
coming
nuptials
this
takes
place
in
the
bride
family
my
and
his
family
came
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
the
first
thing
that
a
european
bridegroom
would
do
on
arriving
at
the
home
of
his
bride
would
be
to
go
to
her
but
among
us
that
would
be
out
of
the
question
the
bridegroom
must
not
see
his
bride
until
the
knot
is
tied
even
his
family
must
not
see
her
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
the
bride
was
bathed
in
a
bath
of
flowers
and
after
that
she
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
toekang
paès
a
woman
whose
business
is
the
dressing
of
brides
the
bride
takes
her
seat
on
a
cloth
that
is
especially
prepared
for
the
occasion
it
consists
of
katoentjes
and
zijdjes
enough
for
a
kabaja
joined
together
this
is
the
property
of
the
toekang
paès
at
her
side
are
placed
sweetmeats
besides
sirrih
pinang
nuts
bananas

remember
the
picture
of
an
article
of
furniture
with
three
doors
in
front
that
is
called
a
kwade
and
it
is
used
at
weddings
a
handsome
carved
kwade
covered
with
gold
figures
on
a
purple
ground
was
in
the
great
hall
at
the
back
of
the
kaboepaten
all
tables
chairs
and
benches
were
removed
from
that
apartment
and
the
floors
were
covered
with
a
great
alcatief
on
both
sides
of
the
kwade
which
was
draped
and
ornamented
with
flowers
stood
two
large
copper
vases
filled
with
young
cocoanut
leaves
and
flowers
these
vases
are
called
kembang
majang
and
must
not
be
broken
at
a
wedding
at
about
seven
in
the
evening
when
all
of
the
women
guests
had
assembled
in
the
and
were
ranged
on
the
ground
in
two
rows
one
on
each
side
of
the
kwade
sister
came
in
led
by
the
hand
of
our
married
sister
and
our
and
followed
by
a
woman
who
carried
her
sirrihdoos
and
kwispeldoor
sister
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
near
her
family
and
the
most
prominent
guests
the
sirrihdoos
and
the
kwispeldoor
were
placed
next
to
her
only
as
a
matter
of
form
for
kleintje
eats
no
sirrih
behind
her
a
little
girl
waved
a
koelte
sister
sat
with
crossed
legs
before
the
gold
shining
kwade
motionless
as
an
image
of
buddha
between
the
gravely
dressed
wives
of
the
native
dignitaries
equal
in
rank
to
her
husband
tea
and
cakes
were
served
every
one
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
several
kinds
of
small
pastries
the
bride
and
the
most
distinguished
guests
each
had
an
individual
and
a
tray
of
pastries
it
was
as
though
a
whole
carpet
of
pastries
were
spread
out
before
the
guests
here
and
there
broken
by
sirrihdoozen
and
kwispeldoors
of
gold
and
tortoiseshell
of
wood
or
of
silver
the
company
was
composed
entirely
of
married
women
we
unmarried
ones
were
not
there
you
have
certainly
heard
that
among
the
javanese
it
is
a
great
misfortune
for
a
woman
to
remain
unmarried
it
is
a
disgrace
as
well
not
so
long
ago
in
enlightened
europe
it
was
looked
upon
in
the
same
way
is
not
that
true
so
we
must
not
think
ill
of
the
foolish
uncivilized
indians
if
the
bridegroom
has
a
mother
on
this
evening
she
must
be
at
the
feast
of
her
our
masculine
guests
ate
with
father
in
the
pendopo
while
the
bridegroom
stayed
at
home
in
his
lodgings
sister
was
so
glad
when
at
nine
the
ceremonial
was
over
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
walked
decorously
and
sedately
from
the
hall
through
the
throng
of
women
sitting
around
but
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
and
safe
in
our
room
all
the
formality
was
gone
she
was
again
our
little
sister
our
dear
happy
kleintje
and
no
buddha
image
that
evening
was
sacred
to
the
prophet
in
the
mosque
there
was
a
great
slamatan
sacrificial
meal
celebrated
with
prayers
the
blessing
of
heaven
was
asked
upon
the
approaching
marriage
at
that
meal
only
men
were
present
our
women
guests
even
the
wives
who
had
come
to
sister
wedding
ate
at
home
with
us
early
the
next
morning
there
was
a
stir
in
the
kaboepaten
it
looked
quite
gay
with
its
decorations
of
greens
and
flags
outside
on
the
highway
there
was
bustle
and
noise
the
tricolour
waved
merrily
among
the
rustling
young
cocoanut
trees
that
bordered
the
road
which
led
to
the
house
of
the
bridegroom
in
the
green
covered
pasehuisen
two
little
houses
on
the
before
the

the
gamelan
played
lustily
we
were
on
the
back
gallery
where
stood
baskets
of
kanangas
tjempakas
and
melaties
women
hands
were
arranging
the
flowers
into
garlands
or
suspending
them
on
little
swings
or
tearing
the
blossoms
from
the
leaves
so
that
they
could
be
strewn
in
the
way
of
the
bridal
pair
wherever
they
might
go
the
kaboepaten
was
filled
with
gamelan
music
and
the
perfume
of
flowers
busy
people
walked
to
and
fro
in
our
room
the
toilet
of
the
bride
was
begun
her
forehead
had
been
painted
dark
before
now
it
was
decorated
with
little
golden
figures
sister
lay
down
during
the
operation
behind
the
figures
there
were
two
borders
fastened
to
the
hair

dark
one
behind

this
jewelled
knobs
were
stuck
with
other
brides
the
is
made
of
their
own
hair
but
for
sister
we
had
a
false
piece
set
in
because
the
elaborate
process
is
painful
and
the
poor
child
had
just
recovered
from
a
fever
above
the
came
a
golden
diadem
and
her
hair
at
the
back
of
the
head
was
dressed
like
a

filled
with

and
reached
to

by
the
seven
jewels

on
their
spirals
behind
these

was
a
jewelled
flower
from
which
hung
six
chains
of
real
flowers
suspended
behind
the
ears
over
the
breast
and
down
to
the
waist
these
chains
which
were
about
as
thick
as
one
fingers
were
made
of
white
flowers
linked
together
with
little
bands
of
gold
and
ending
in
a
round
knob
which
was
stuck
full
of
melati
flowers
her
wajang
costume
was
décolleté
in
front
so
that
neck

and
arms
were
entirely
uncovered

that
was
visible

the
face
which
was
whitened

covered
with
a
fragrant
salve

wore
a
gold
embroidered
kain
over
which
there
was
a
drapery
of
gold

with
long
hanging
ends
of
red

with
figures

golden
chains
dangled
from
these
it
was
between
three
and
four
in
the
afternoon
in
the
kwade
hall
the
wives
of
the
native
nobles
assembled
in
gala
attire
from
the
kwade
to
the
pendopo
there
was
a
carpet
of
flowers
over
which
the
bridal
pair
must
walk
the
bride
was
led
forward
by
her
sisters
and
took
her
place
before
the
kwade
the
lights
were
already
lighted
in
the
pendopo
the
regents
stood
assembled
in
official
costume
and
there
were
a
few
european
acquaintances
who
were
anxious
to
see
sister
for
the
last
time
as
a
maiden
in
the
and
all
outside
the
kaboepaten
it
was
dark
with
people
only
the
road
which
was
decorated
with
flags
and
green
leaves
remained
free
a
streak
of
yellow
could
be
seen
in
the
distance
it
drew
nearer
till
there
appeared
a
train
of
open
parasols
pajoengs
under
which
the
native
officials
walk
on
great
occasions
it
was
the
retinue
which
preceded
the
bridegroom
who
with
the
other
regents
was
in
an
open
carriage
which
was
covered
with
a
glittering
golden
parasol
gamelan
music
sounded
from
the
pasebans
and
the
kaboepaten
to
greet
the
approaching
procession
it
reached
the
kaboepaten
and
halted
at
the
door
of
the
pendopo
the
whole
company
squatted
down
the
bridegroom
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
was
led
forward
by
two
unmarried
regents
they
went
into
the
pendopo
and
all
three
knelt
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
to
do
homage
to
father
and
the
other
regents
the
two
regents
moved
back
still
on
their
knees
and
left
the
bridegroom
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
pendopo
the
chiefs
formed
a
circle
around
him
within
which
there
was
a
smaller
circle
of
priests
father
sat
at
the
head
of
the
regents
and
the
high
priest
who
was
to
perform
the
ceremony
next
to
the
bridegroom
father
announced
to
those
present
the
reason
for
the
calling
of
this
assembly
and
said
that
he
now
sought
the
assistance
of
the
high
priest
to
bind
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
bridegroom
from
the
crowd
of
people
in
the
pendopo
there
arose
a
mystic
buzzing
noise
they
were
praying
i
was
so
sorry
that
i
could
not
be
near
enough
to
hear
a
teacher
who
is
a
friend
of
ours
sister
roekmini
and
i
were
the
only
women
in
the
pendopo
which
was
filled
with
men
but
we
were
very
glad
to
be
allowed
there
at
all
and
to
have
that
much
freedom
granted
us
it
would
not
have
been
seemly
for
us
to
appear
among
a
crowd
of
men
during
the
celebration
of
a
marriage
ceremony
it
was
a
pity
as
we
should
have
been
glad
to
hear
the
betrothal
formulas
we
could
only
see
that
during
the
betrothal
service
the
priest
held
fast
to
the
hand
of
the
bridegroom
who
had
to
respond
after
him
the
solemnity
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
most
but
we
did
not
have
a
watch
with
minutes
so
we
could
not
tell
exactly
it
was
impressive
and
still
in
the
pendopo
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
save
the
mystic
droning
of
the
priests
there
was
a
stir
among
the
crowd
of
men
and
the
priests
rose
from
their
knees
the
ceremony
was
over
the
regents
stood
up
two
of
them
lifted
up
the
bridegroom
and
now
they
started
off
over
the
carpet
of
flowers
followed
by
the
most
prominent
regents
back
in
the
kwade
hall
the
bride
was
raised
up
by
her
sisters
and
supported
by
them
she
too
started
down
the
road
of
flowers
followed
by
mamma
and
all
the
women
guests
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
came
within
a
few
steps
of
each
other
those
who
were
leading
them
fell
back
and
the
bridal
pair
gave
each
to
the
other
a
rolled
up
filled
with
flowers
they
took
a
few
steps
nearer
and
then
both
knelt
down
and
with
them
the
whole
company
the
bridegroom
sat
on
her
knees
the
bride
moved
nearer
to
him
and
made
a
sembah
both
hands
held
together
and
brought
down
under
the
nose
that
is
our
mark
of
reverence
then
she
kissed
his
right
knee
again
the
bride
made
a
sembah
the
bridegroom
rose
and
raised
his
wife
and
hand
in
hand
the
young
pair
walked
over
the
carpet
of
flowers
to
the
kwade
followed
by
the
whole
company
except
the
regents
who
turned
back
to
the
pendopo
bride
and
bridegroom
sat
before
the
kwade
like
two
images
of
buddha
the
family
and
the
lady
guests
thronged
around
them
behind
the
bridal
pair
sat
two
little
girls
wafting
their
koeltes
to
and
fro
in
most
cases
husband
and
wife
see
each
other
for
the
first
time
at
this
ceremony
at
the
stroke
of
seven
the
regents
came
back
and
formed
a
on
the
ground
around
the
bridal
pair
the
women
of
their
families
formed
the
other
half
of
the
circle
the
bride
and
bridegroom
saluted
the
older
relatives
with
the
the
bride
first
raised
herself
on
her
knees
and
shuffled
forward
toward
mamma
she
made
a
sembah
and
kissed
mamma
knee
to
beg
her
blessing
on
her
marriage
from
mamma
sister
went
to
the
aunts
sisters
and
cousins
to
all
those
who
were
older
than
she
and
went
through
with
the
same
ceremony
then
she
went
to
father
and
kissed
his
knee
in
order
to
receive
his
blessing
from
him
she
went
to
her
after
that
to
her
uncles
and
cousins
when
she
had
finished
kissing
the
feet
of
all
and
had
returned
again
to
her
place
the
bridegroom
began
the
journey
he
followed
the
example
of
his
wife
when
he
had
completed
this
ceremony
the
regents
went
out
and
tea
and
pastry
were
served
as
on
the
evening
before
at
eight
bride
and
bridegroom
departed
hand
in
hand
they
left
the
hall
usually
they
must
go
out
on
their
knees
but
as
both
of
them
had
just
recovered
from
illness
they
were
allowed
to
walk
in
other
families
the
bridegroom
must
creep
up
the
steps
instead
of
walking
on
coming
to
the
house
of
his
before
he
pays
his
respects
to
the
ladies
of
the
family
that
is
the
perfection
of
good
manners
the
bridegroom
went
to
the
bridal
chamber
and
sister
to
our
room
where
we
dressed
her
for
the
reception
to
europeans
her
bridal
toilet
which
had
been
the
work
of
a
whole
day
was
undone
in
five
minutes
only
the
headdress
and
the
decorations
on
her
forehead
were
left
unchanged
we
young
girls
ought
not
to
have
dressed
her
alone
but
we
did
it
just
the
same
we
thought
that
it
was
entirely
too
stupid
for
us
not
to
be
allowed
to
touch
sister
in
her
bridal
toilet
sister
now
put
on
a
kain
of
silk
interwoven
with
gold
and
a
kabaja
of
satin
with
silver
embroidery
she
wore
another
jewelled
collar
the
jewelled
flowers
in
her
hair
and
the
diadem
were
taken
off
in
their
stead
she
wore
a
golden
crown
from
which
hung
a
veil
on
her
head
jewelled
flowers
on
spirals
were
fastened
so
veiled
and
crowned
it
was
as
though
she
had
stepped
from
a
page
of
the
thousand
and
one
nights
sister
looked
like
one
of
the
fairy
princesses
the
costume
was
very
becoming
to
her
what
a
pity
that
she
could
not
have
been
photographed
in
it
the
bridegroom
appeared
in
his
official
dress
again
the
bridal
pair
sat
before
the
kwade
at
eight
they
went
arm
in
arm
to
the
front
gallery
where
two
gilded
settees
stood
ready
for
them
before
a
background
of
palms
they
received
the
good
wishes
of
the
european
ladies
and
gentlemen
standing
it
was
called
a
reception
but
at
the
sound
of
the
music
the
feet
turned
toward
the
empty
pendopo
bride
and
bridegroom
both
took
a
few
turns
around
the
pendopo
it
is
not
customary
for
young
girls
to
appear
at
a
wedding
but
it
would
have
been
foolish
for
us
to
remain
away
from
sister
feast
it
was
not
yet
twelve
when
the
resident
who
was
among
the
guests
toasted
the
young
pair
his
speech
was
answered
by
father
soon
after
the
european
guests
took
their
leave
all
but
the
resident
and
a
few
others
among
them
a
lady
who
is
an
intimate
friend
of
ours
they
remained
for
the
native
part
of
the
feast
after
the
departure
of
the
european
guests
the
native
nobles
who
had
absented
themselves
from
the
pendopo
during
the
reception
came
in
and
formed
a
before
which
the
bridegroom
must
give
a
proof
of
his
proficiency
in
dancing
the
regents
as
well
as
the
other
chiefs
had
meanwhile
dressed
in
more
informal
costume
the
gamelan
played
a
entered
and
began
to
dance
the
patih
of
japara
brought
on
his
knees
a
silver
waiter
to
the
bridegroom
on
which
there
was
a
silken
cloth
when
the
bridegroom
had
taken
the
cloth
the
patih
fell
back
soft
gamelan
tones
again
sounded
it
was
a
prelude
an
invitation
to
the
hero
of
the
day
to
open
the
feast
the
bridegroom
rose
and
went
to
the
middle
of
the
pendopo
he
fastened
the
silken
cloth
around
him
and
named
his
favourite
air
to
the
gamelan
players
the
gongs
chimed
it
was
immediately
struck
up
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
dance
my
pen
is
inadequate
i
shall
only
say
that
it
was
a
joy
to
the
eyes
to
follow
the
agile
dancer
in
his
graceful
movements
as
he
kept
time
to
the
beautiful
gamelan
music
behind
him
danced
the
also
singing
the
circle
of
native
dignitaries
accompanied
the
music
by
singing
and
beating
their
hands
together
toward
the
end
of
the
dance
the
resident
went
forward
with
two
glasses
of
champagne
the
gong
sounded
and
both
dancers
fell
upon
their
knees
with
a
sembah
the
bridegroom
accepted
a
glass
from
the
resident
he
drank
it
and
the
resident
emptied
his
at
the
same
time
amid
joyful
gamelan
tones
and
sounds
of
general
mirth
a
servant
took
the
empty
glasses
and
the
resident
fell
back
the
bridegroom
stood
up
and
again
began
to
dance
now
his
brought
him
a
health
to
drink
dancing
they
advanced
to
meet
each
other
and
at
the
sound
of
the
gong
the
young
man
knelt
down
to
receive
the
from
the
hand
of
the
older
one
after
a
health
had
been
brought
to
him
by
all
the
regents
present
he
left
them
and
went
back
to
sit
by
the
side
of
his
wife
soon
after
that
the
bridal
pair
left
the
assembly
the
european
guests
went
home
but
the
feast
was
kept
up
till
early
in
the
morning
the
european
gentlemen
had
danced
too
and
our
assistant
resident
acquitted
himself
excellently
mamma
our
friend
sister
roekmini
and
i
stayed
till
the
last
european
guest
had
gone
the
next
day
there
was
quiet
in
the
house
in
the
afternoon
the
last
ceremony
took
place
that
is
the
first
visit
of
the
bridal
pair
to
the
parents
of
the
groom
it
is
called
in
javanese
ngoendoh
mantoe
which
literally
translated
means
plucking
the
is
compared
to
a
flower
which
her
husband
parents
will
pluck
for
this
occasion
both
bride
and
groom
should
again
put
on
their
bridal
costume
but
that
would
have
been
much
too
wearisome
so
the
groom
was
dressed
as
usual
and
sister
wore
a
kain
interwoven
with
gold
and
a
silk
kabaja
her
hair
was
dressed
in
the
form
of
a
cap
and
on
her
head
was
a
small
sheath
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
which
was
filled
with
flowers
and
over
the
whole
was
a
network
of
melati
blossoms
and
again
the
jewelled
spirals
waved
to
and
fro
above
her
head
the
bridal
pair
went
in
a
procession
followed
by
the
native
chiefs
on
foot
to
the
house
where
the
father
of
the
bridegroom
lodged
days
and
weeks
after
the
wedding
the
newly
married
pair
are
still
called
bride
and
bridegroom
the
bride
is
a
bride
until
she
becomes
a
mother
there
are
women
mothers
who
all
their
lives
are
called
nganten
short
for
penganten
which
means
bride
and
also
bridegroom
the
day
after
the
ceremony
was
spent
in
receiving
visits
from
both
europeans
and
natives
five
days
later
there
was
again
a
feast
in
the
kaboepaten
the
first
return
of
the
holy
day
which
had
opened
the
wedding
ceremonies
was
celebrated
the
young
couple
left
a
week
after
the
wedding
they
were
feted
everywhere
by
various
family
connections
with
whom
they
stopped
on
their
journey
home
at
tegal
the
marriage
was
celebrated
all
over
again
they
remained
there
a
week
and
finally
they
reached
their
own
home
at
pemalang
there
you
have
a
description
of
a
javanese
wedding
in
high
circles
sister
marriage
was
called
only
a
quiet
affair
and
yet
it
entailed
all
that
ceremony
what
must
a
wedding
be
that
is
celebrated
in
a
gala
way
we
were
dead
tired
after
the
wedding
the
javanese
give
presents
at
a
marriage
things
to
wear
such
as
kains
stomachers
headdresses
silk
for
kabajas
cloth
for
jackets
and
also
things
to
eat
such
as
rice
eggs
chickens
or
a
buffalo
these
are
merely
meant
as
marks
of
kardinah
also
received
a
splendid
bull
from
an
uncle
this
had
to
be
placed
on
exhibition
with
the
other
presents
when
a
buffalo
is
killed
at
the
time
of
a
wedding
and
usually
more
than
one
is
needed
for
the
feast
meals
a
bamboo
vessel
filled
with
sirrih
little
cakes
pinang
nuts
and
pieces
of
meat
must
be
mixed
with
the
running
blood
of
the
slaughtered
buffalo
these
vessels
covered
with
flowers
are
laid
at
all
of
the
bridges
and
wells
on
the
estate
as
an
offering
to
the
spirits
who
dwell
there
if
these
bridge
road
and
water
spirits
are
not
propitiated
they
will
be
offended
at
the
festivities
and
misfortune
will
come
of
it
that
is
the
belief
of
the
people
its
origin
i
do
not
know
a
friend
of
ours
says
rightly
that
the
javanese
are
a
people
who
are
filled
with
legends
and
superstitions
who
shall
lead
the
people
out
of
the
dusky
realm
of
fairy
tales
into
the
light
of
work
and
reality
and
then
when
superstition
is
cast
off
we
do
not
want
the
poetry
to
be
trampled
under
foot
but
of
what
good
is
my
prattling
let
me
rather
ask
you
if
you
have
been
interested
in
this
epistle
and
if
you
will
now
forgive
me
for
my
long
silence
there
is
so
much
that
is
lovable
in
my
people
such
charm
in
their
simple
naïve
beliefs
it
may
sound
strange
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
fact
that
you
europeans
have
taught
me
to
love
my
own
land
and
people
instead
of
estranging
us
from
our
native
land
our
european
education
has
brought
us
nearer
to
it
has
opened
our
hearts
to
its
beauties
and
also
to
the
needs
of
our
people
and
to
their
weaknesses
do
not
let
me
tire
you
any
longer
with
the
scribbling
of
a
silly
javanese
girl
i
have
written
enough
postscript
in
some
places
it
is
the
custom
when
the
bridal
pair
meet
for
the
first
time
for
the
bride
to
wash
the
groom
feet
as
a
token
of
submission
before
she
gives
him
the
whenever
a
widower
marries
a
young
girl
or
a
widow
a
young
man
the
giving
of
the
sirrih
at
the
wedding
is
omitted
the
one
who
has
already
been
married
hands
the
other
who
carries
a
a
piece
of
burning
wood
the
contents
of
the
can
are
poured
upon
the
fire
which
naturally
goes
out
whereupon
the
charred
wood
is
thrown
away
and
the
broken
into
pieces
the
symbolism
of
this
i
do
not
have
to
explain
it
is
plain
enough
you
should
have
seen
sister
as
she
sat
there
before
the
kwade
she
ought
to
have
been
photographed
or
better
still
painted
because
that
would
have
shown
the
colouring
she
stepped
so
calmly
and
sedately
down
the
carpet
of
flowers
everywhere
there
were
flowers
and
the
perfume
of
incense
yes
truly
she
was
much
like
a
bodhisatwa
incarnation
of
buddha
i
can
not
hear
the
gamelan
or
smell
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
incense
without
seeing
her
image
before
my
eyes
the
people
picked
up
the
flowers
over
which
sister
had
walked
and
kept
them
they
bring
good
luck
it
is
said
and
to
young
daughters
a
husband
to
mevrouw
de
pieces
of
cotton
and
silk
a
scarf
or
shawl
draped
to
form
part
of
the
costume
the
box
to
hold
the
sirrih
paste
a
for
it
is
necessary
to
spit
after
chewing
sirrih
these
boxes
are
often
of
gold
or
tortoiseshell
and
beautifully
ornamented
they
are
placed
by
a
javanese
lady
on
all
formal
as
well
as
informal
occasions
heildronk
in
the
orig
dutch
toast
would
be
appropriate
here
xxxvi
it
is
always
said
of
the
girls
here
that
they
are
well
provided
for
and
comfortably
taken
care
of
have
they
a
right
to
complain
well
means
happiness
the
opposite
of
misery
and
misery
is
what
the
women
feel
and
yet
they
have
no
right
to
complain
they
are
said
to
act
always
of
their
own
free
will
but
how
about
their
children
what
is
more
wretched
than
a
sad
childhood
than
children
who
too
early
have
learned
to
read
the
shadow
side
of
life
i
once
copied
something
from
a
speech
by
max
müller
the
great
german
scholar
who
was
so
learned
in
eastern
tongues
it
was
almost
as
follows
polygamy
as
it
is
practiced
by
the
eastern
people
is
of
benefit
to
women
and
girls
who
could
not
live
in
their
environment
without
a
man
to
take
care
of
them
and
to
protect
them
max
müller
is
dead
we
can
not
call
him
here
to
show
him
the
benefits
of
that
custom
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xxxvii
i
can
not
tell
you
how
great
was
my
joy
when
at
last
i
was
able
to
begin
my
studies
so
far
it
has
been
but
a
review
of
what
i
once
learned
at
school
more
than
ten
full
years
ago
but
there
is
one
advantage
in
this
late
study
i
can
understand
now
much
more
quickly
and
readily
than
i
could
in
my
childhood
still
it
is
a
deep
grief
to
me
that
i
am
now
years
old
instead
of
thirteen
i
could
then
look
forward
so
far
i
could
have
carried
on
my
studies
indefinitely
but
now
time
is
limited
on
account
of
my
age
first
i
am
working
at
dutch
so
that
i
shall
have
it
thoroughly
in
my
head
and
then
later
i
must
study
one
or
two
of
the
native
languages
there
i
have
struck
so
hard
with
my
pen
that
my
is
broken
through
the
middle
but
even
that
does
not
make
me
give
up
poor
pen
i
have
depended
so
much
upon
it
and
we
have
worked
together
happily
for
so
long
i
must
be
a
strange
creature
to
lament
over
a
broken
in
april
we
went
on
a
journey
we
paid
our
sister
a
visit
we
left
our
home
without
the
least
idea
of
seeing
her
again
we
went
to
see
another
sister
our
eldest
who
was
ill
while
we
were
there
we
received
an
urgent
letter
from
little
sister
begging
us
to
come
to
pemalang
to
see
her
we
set
out
early
the
next
morning
how
can
i
describe
that
meeting
to
you
it
was
simply
blissful
we
did
nothing
the
first
few
moments
but
look
at
one
another
and
hold
one
another
tight
and
i
was
so
thankful
to
see
her
well
she
had
never
looked
so
fresh
and
blooming
before
she
had
roses
in
her
cheeks
and
beyond
everything
it
delighted
me
to
see
how
her
husband
valued
and
honoured
her
it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
i
have
learned
to
know
my
new
he
is
a
good
sincere
man
with
many
fine
traits
he
is
very
upright
just
and
true
and
has
a
sympathetic
heart
she
is
his
comrade
his
advisor
his
friend
and
a
mother
as
well
to
his
three
children
who
are
as
fond
of
her
as
if
she
were
their
own
mother
the
children
follow
her
footsteps
everywhere
like
little
faithful
dogs
the
oldest
child
a
boy
of
seven
had
lived
with
his
grandparents
sister
took
him
in
charge
and
the
child
is
devoted
to
her
now
and
loves
to
be
with
her
though
his
grandparents
did
not
keep
him
at
arm
length
you
may
be
sure
the
two
others
are
girls
of
six
and
four
she
gives
them
lessons
at
home
so
i
might
almost
call
them
little
pupils
stella
he
leaves
the
education
of
his
children
entirely
to
her
and
naturally
sister
will
bring
up
her
little
daughters
in
our
spirit
sister
has
not
been
able
to
realize
her
early
dream
as
she
had
dreamed
it
but
is
the
task
which
she
has
undertaken
less
beautiful
for
that
reason
our
roads
have
divided
but
both
of
us
work
for
the
same
ideal
what
matters
it
which
road
one
takes
if
it
but
leads
to
the
same
goal
i
long
to
go
to
holland
for
many
reasons
the
first
is
study
the
second
is
that
i
want
european
air
to
blow
upon
the
few
remaining
prejudices
that
still
cling
to
me
so
that
they
may
be
wholly
driven
away
there
are
not
many
left
it
is
true
but
some
obstinately
remain
only
your
cold
air
stella
can
make
of
me
in
truth
a
free
woman
to
mention
but
one
of
the
persistent
little
prejudices
i
should
not
be
disturbed
in
the
least
if
i
were
alone
in
a
room
filled
with
european
gentlemen
but
i
can
think
of
nothing
that
could
make
me
under
any
possible
circumstances
receive
alone
even
one
javanese
young
man
who
was
unmarried
i
think
it
is
laughable
absurd
idiotic
but
it
is
true
i
dare
not
talk
to
a
strange
man
without
a
companion
and
even
if
there
were
company
i
should
think
it
tiresome
and
should
not
feel
at
my
ease
so
you
see
that
in
spite
of
my
strong
ideas
of
freedom
i
can
not
get
away
from
the
influence
of
my
native
environment
which
keeps
girls
strictly
secluded
when
the
idea
has
been
strongly
inculcated
that
it
is
not
modest
to
show
oneself
to
strange
men
eyes
then
it
is
a
hard
task
to
break
away
from
it
it
must
not
remain
always
so
that
prejudice
must
go
how
else
shall
we
be
able
to
work
together
with
men
and
that
is
part
of
our
plan
one
way
in
which
we
hope
to
accomplish
much
good
only
the
air
of
europe
will
be
potent
to
separate
me
from
the
influence
of
my
javanese
education
sometimes
i
laugh
at
myself
and
it
drives
away
the
foolishness
for
a
little
but
it
always
comes
back
we
returned
from
our
journey
on
the
of
april
father
came
several
stations
to
meet
us
he
brought
a
long
official
telegram
from
the
resident
which
announced
that
the
heer
van
kol
would
come
to
japara
the
next
day
that
was
a
delightful
greeting
of
welcome
and
i
found
something
still
nicer
when
i
got
home
your
letter
all
the
government
officials
along
the
whole
line
received
the
orders
from
the
resident
to
wait
upon
the
heer
van
kol
as
he
passed
through
on
sunday
afternoon
at
the
stroke
of
three
the
travellers
arrived
with
van
kol
was
a
journalist
who
served
him
as
interpreter
and
guide
and
father
who
had
waited
for
him
at
the
border
van
kol
had
made
a
resolution
never
to
lodge
anywhere
except
in
a
hotel
because
he
knows
well
the
open
hospitality
of
the
country
but
after
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
our
family
and
received
a
pressing
invitation
he
stayed
with
us
later
we
heard
that
it
was
we
who
had
been
responsible
for
his
faithlessness
to
his
resolution
he
thought
us
worthy
of
scrutiny
he
wished
to
observe
the
influence
of
european
education
on
girls
of
the
aristocracy
and
could
not
let
the
opportunity
pass
happily
we
did
not
hear
this
till
afterwards
the
knowledge
would
have
made
us
constrained
and
at
the
table
he
talked
almost
constantly
of
his
wife
and
children
it
was
splendid
to
hear
how
this
great
man
honours
his
wife
he
met
her
through
correspondence
a
point
of
resemblance
there
stella
he
corresponded
with
her
at
first
about
her
literary
work
it
was
only
by
chance
that
she
discovered
her
great
gift
her
talent
for
writing
she
was
at
that
time
a
governess
and
was
staying
with
some
friends
at
a
villa
on
the
slope
of
the
pinanggoengan
their
villa
now
in
prinsenhage
is
called
after
that
villa
lali
djiwa
soul
rest
one
of
the
party
must
write
a
description
of
the
place
and
they
drew
lots
to
decide
which
one
it
should
be
the
lot
fell
upon
her
she
sent
the
article
to
a
magazine
and
the
editor
wrote
asking
her
for
more
van
kol
has
been
to
all
of
the
places
where
he
lived
and
worked
in
his
early
days
and
the
children
who
formerly
played
with
his
daughter
he
found
mothers
themselves
when
he
went
back
but
he
still
remembered
them
and
knew
them
all
by
their
names
stella
we
were
happier
that
evening
with
the
heer
van
kol
than
we
have
been
in
a
long
time
at
first
we
showed
them
examples
of
the
artistic
work
of
our
people
which
called
forth
expressions
of
wonder
and
admiration
and
heer
van
kol
made
some
sketches
of
them
some
of
the
company
moved
away
and
the
chair
next
to
him
was
empty
i
slipped
into
it
then
he
began
you
have
planned
to
go
to
holland
melchers
told
me
so
on
my
answering
in
the
affirmative
he
went
on
but
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
later
when
you
come
back
the
greatest
difficulty
lies
in
coming
back
to
the
old
life
why
do
you
think
that
he
spoke
frankly
and
openly
and
said
it
would
be
too
difficult
for
you
if
later
on
you
should
marry
after
having
lived
in
holland
you
would
never
be
able
to
make
yourself
contented
as
the
wife
of
a
native
chief
he
instanced
cases
of
well
educated
native
girls
their
friends
who
had
married
hollanders
they
and
their
husbands
were
devoted
to
one
another
but
the
indian
can
not
be
really
happy
amid
european
surroundings
and
the
hollander
can
never
accustom
himself
to
the
indian
life
so
there
is
always
an
impassable
gulf
between
husband
and
wife
i
let
him
finish
quietly
before
i
brought
my
own
ideas
to
the
light
of
day
mijnheer
van
kol
if
i
should
go
to
holland
my
intention
is
to
be
educated
for
a
profession
that
of
teaching
preferably
and
when
i
come
back
i
plan
to
open
an
institute
for
the
daughters
of
native
chiefs
it
is
to
study
that
i
wish
to
go
there
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
his
blue
eyes
lighted
up
as
though
to
himself
he
said
that
is
a
fine
idea
a
very
fine
idea
then
to
me
do
you
not
think
it
splendid
to
have
an
object
in
life
there
was
so
much
enthusiasm
in
his
voice
and
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
i
felt
my
heart
grow
warm
involuntarily
my
lips
formed
a
word
a
name
stella
stella
if
i
could
only
have
you
here
but
then
the
earth
would
be
too
small
to
hold
my
happiness
for
that
was
happiness
that
moment
when
i
saw
that
my
plans
were
understood
and
respected
too
by
a
superior
man
like
van
kol
it
was
like
the
feeling
that
mothers
must
have
when
they
hear
their
children
understood
and
praised
he
asked
if
i
had
talked
with
mevrouw
rooseboom
no
i
had
never
had
the
opportunity
both
times
i
had
met
her
there
had
been
a
great
company
a
ball
or
a
dinner
they
seemed
to
have
spoken
of
us
at
the
palace
because
heer
van
kol
told
me
as
soon
as
he
arrived
that
his
excellency
the
governor
general
had
said
that
he
knew
me
annie
glazer
goes
on
her
vacation
next
month
to
batavia
and
to
buitenzorg
she
will
go
for
us
to
the
abendanons
and
tell
them
all
that
we
have
in
our
hearts
she
will
go
too
to
our
friends
at
buitenzorg
could
i
but
go
with
her
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
present
a
petition
or
something
of
the
kind
which
heer
van
kol
will
write
for
us
from
batavia
the
petition
will
set
forth
our
names
our
ages
and
very
briefly
what
we
want
to
do
and
to
make
sure
that
he
will
remember
us
when
he
gets
to
holland
i
have
at
his
instigation
written
to
his
wife
and
explained
our
plans
to
her
he
was
delighted
at
roekmini
idea
of
going
to
the
art
academy
and
also
to
know
that
she
wished
to
go
through
the
household
school
for
indeed
it
appears
that
she
has
not
enough
talent
to
ever
go
very
far
in
her
art
he
shared
our
belief
that
a
teacher
of
domestic
science
could
help
our
people
very
much
but
he
is
anxious
for
her
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
academy
for
a
few
months
before
she
starts
on
her
domestic
studies
he
thought
it
fine
that
we
two
should
wish
to
work
together
and
help
each
other
he
said
many
times
over
i
think
it
splendid
for
you
two
to
want
to
undertake
so
much
i
have
talked
to
him
about
the
idea
of
teaching
hygiene
and
kindred
subjects
in
our
schools
and
let
him
understand
that
i
should
be
glad
to
take
a
course
in
hygiene
and
nursing
in
order
to
teach
them
later
he
thought
that
a
good
idea
too
in
india
you
could
not
study
that
except
under
great
difficulties
in
europe
it
would
be
quite
easy
there
you
would
have
everything
under
your
hand
and
you
could
easily
get
through
in
a
few
years
as
you
speak
and
write
dutch
very
well
i
told
him
of
other
reasons
why
we
wished
to
sojourn
for
a
time
in
europe
he
sympathized
with
us
there
too
and
he
was
one
with
us
in
the
belief
that
our
ideas
would
be
able
to
compel
a
larger
following
that
we
could
spread
them
broadcast
if
we
worked
under
the
protection
of
the
government
the
javanese
nation
is
like
a
great
child
that
loves
show
and
display
it
respects
everything
with
which
the
all
powerful
government
concerns
itself
we
talked
of
the
education
if
such
it
may
be
called
of
the
daughters
of
the
nobles
van
kol
knows
regents
wives
and
knows
of
their
monotonous
dull
lives
it
was
time
that
something
should
be
done
for
javanese
girls
he
is
the
last
man
with
whom
i
should
have
to
argue
about
the
importance
of
woman
place
in
society
he
spoke
of
his
own
noble
and
highly
gifted
wife
with
such
love
and
respect
he
called
her
his
counsellor
and
his
guiding
star
it
touched
me
deeply
to
hear
this
man
making
himself
so
small
beside
his
wife
he
is
small
in
body
but
great
in
heart
and
soul
it
was
delightful
to
be
in
his
company
i
have
been
asked
to
put
my
ideas
in
writing
in
the
form
of
a
brochure
or
letter
to
the
queen
it
would
do
much
good
to
our
cause
if
she
who
is
a
woman
herself
knows
of
the
deep
injustice
that
our
women
suffer
but
i
must
know
what
i
am
doing
as
soon
as
i
let
my
voice
be
heard
i
know
that
i
shall
bring
down
the
anger
and
hate
of
many
of
the
javanese
men
upon
my
head
for
myself
personally
i
do
not
fear
their
hate
or
anger
but
if
i
should
become
a
teacher
i
might
have
to
stand
before
a
class
without
scholars
because
no
father
would
trust
his
children
to
me
i
should
have
touched
the
egoism
of
man
i
have
received
an
answer
to
my
question
as
to
when
a
mohammedan
girl
comes
of
age
it
is
a
mohammedan
girl
never
comes
of
age
if
she
wishes
to
be
free
she
would
have
to
marry
and
after
that
be
divorced
so
we
shall
have
to
declare
ourselves
of
age
and
compel
the
world
to
recognize
our
independence
you
know
that
van
kol
came
here
with
a
journalist
he
wrote
a
description
of
the
journey
that
he
made
with
van
kol
also
the
visit
to
the
kaboepaten
is
described
and
something
is
told
of
our
conversation
with
heer
van
kol
now
people
will
know
whither
we
are
going
i
only
hope
that
making
our
ideas
public
will
do
good
and
not
harm
for
the
first
time
my
name
would
come
out
openly
in
connection
with
my
people
i
am
proud
of
that
stella
to
be
named
with
the
same
breath
with
my
people
keep
this
portrait
in
memory
of
the
triple
bond
poor
clover
leaf
it
was
too
beautiful
so
it
had
to
be
pulled
apart
it
is
the
best
portrait
that
we
have
it
is
good
of
all
of
us
it
was
made
at
christmas
time
and
it
is
our
last
portrait
taken
together
as
girls
the
sight
of
the
little
group
makes
me
sorrowful
three
hearts
grew
together
on
one
stem
and
now
one
of
them
has
been
torn
away
will
the
wound
ever
heal
it
still
bleeds
at
the
least
touch
oh
stella
you
do
not
know
how
we
miss
her
everything
reminds
us
of
her
speaks
of
her
we
feel
so
old
now
the
past
seems
to
lie
behind
us
like
an
eternity
and
yet
a
half
year
has
not
gone
by
since
she
left
us
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
xxxviii
i
have
read
your
last
letter
over
many
times
in
it
you
write
so
sympathetically
about
the
javanese
people
it
is
very
pleasant
that
you
should
have
such
friendly
thoughts
towards
the
brown
race
if
i
could
only
have
you
here
with
us
there
are
so
many
things
about
my
people
which
i
should
be
glad
to
show
you
where
can
one
study
and
learn
to
understand
a
people
better
than
in
the
heart
of
that
people
and
here
we
have
a
true
javanese
environment
you
know
that
all
of
you
would
be
welcome
at
any
time
it
is
charming
of
you
to
wish
to
have
me
with
you
but
alas
for
the
present
i
may
only
appreciate
your
good
will
to
travel
alone
to
buitenzorg
belongs
just
now
to
the
realm
of
forbidden
fruit
but
who
knows
when
a
change
may
come
so
much
that
seems
to
us
today
to
be
absolutely
impossible
appears
tomorrow
as
an
accomplished
fact
the
javanese
are
a
nation
filled
with
memories
and
fairy
tales
in
dreams
and
fairy
tales
the
most
wonderful
things
happen
and
my
heart
which
is
javanese
through
and
through
holds
fast
to
the
illusion
that
there
can
still
be
miracles
even
as
there
were
in
the
far
distant
past
if
you
knew
of
the
dreams
of
some
javanese
girls
that
you
know
possibly
you
might
be
surprised
at
them
think
them
strange
but
you
would
not
i
hope
merely
shrug
your
shoulders
in
pity
you
know
do
you
not
that
we
are
possessed
by
the
idea
of
going
to
your
country
but
you
do
not
know
why
what
one
naturally
thinks
when
one
speaks
of
visiting
strange
lands
is
of
seeing
and
understanding
new
things
enjoying
oneself
and
perhaps
also
of
learning
accomplishments
but
when
we
feel
so
much
for
the
suffering
of
our
people
is
it
strange
then
that
there
should
be
in
us
a
great
longing
to
do
something
that
will
help
them
what
has
that
to
do
with
our
desire
to
go
to
your
country
we
wish
to
gather
knowledge
and
bring
back
to
our
people
the
treasures
of
other
lands
of
your
own
country
first
of
all
we
do
not
wish
to
change
the
spirit
of
the
native
javanese
but
to
cultivate
the
good
which
is
latent
in
them
that
is
the
goal
which
we
have
set
before
our
eyes
it
is
such
a
pity
that
we
live
so
far
from
each
other
how
nice
it
would
be
if
we
could
exchange
thoughts
and
ideas
things
can
be
expressed
so
much
better
in
spoken
than
in
written
words
but
our
correspondence
is
very
pleasant
to
me
we
meet
at
so
many
points
how
gladly
i
should
teach
you
to
know
and
understand
my
people
a
wonder
artist
must
rise
up
in
java
to
tell
of
our
race
in
beautiful
words
to
his
fellow
countrymen
just
as
fielding
has
written
of
the
burmanese
now
we
have
only
that
notorious
book
by
veth
that
has
brought
so
many
pens
into
motion
and
caused
a
storm
of
anger
to
break
forth
every
land
has
its
own
individual
faults
india
just
as
well
as
every
other
country
on
this
round
earth
poor
india
in
foreign
lands
one
knows
so
bitterly
little
of
you
and
a
book
like
that
of
veth
will
certainly
not
gain
you
sympathy
augusta

wit
writes
with
understanding
and
in
beautiful
language
about
india
we
always
read
her
articles
in
the
with
much
pleasure
in
everything
that
concerns
nature
and
art
and
in
dreams
borel
is
delightful
on
other
subjects
he
has
less
good
to
say
he
goes
hand
in
hand
with
his
friend
veth
have
you
read
what
borel
has
written
about
the
gamelan
we
think
it
a
little
jewel
and
did
you
see
the
article
by
martine
tonnet
about
the
wajang
orang
at
the
court
of
djokarta
that
too
is
a
jewel
i
wish
that
borel
would
go
there
he
might
feel
inspired
to
break
into
charming
poetry
the
dance
of
the
princes
of
solo
and
djokarta
must
be
magnificent
it
is
the
dance
of
dances
it
is
said
it
is
a
pity
that
we
can
not
go
to
djokarta
we
have
often
been
invited
but
it
would
be
so
wearisome
to
dress
in
court
costume
and
at
court
every
one
must
be
dressed
like
a
bride
do
you
know
that
fairy
story
by
marie
we
think
it
very
fine
it
seems
to
me
that
she
must
be
a
great
admirer
of
van
eeden
dat

wilde
reminds
me
of
de
kleine
johannes
do
you
not
like
that
too
it
is
so
true
in
thought
and
in
style
it
is
charming
i
read
what
you
wrote
of
your
little
protégé
with
great
interest
and
also
what
you
said
of
the
poor
in
holland
i
hear
much
of
the
misery
of
the
poor
there
when
winter
comes
poor
poor
simple
creatures
i
correspond
with
a
frieslander
she
tells
me
about
conditions
in
holland
especially
in
friesland
in
the
winter
time
she
has
often
sat
down
on
the
ground
beside
poor
people
who
lived
in
little
hovels
of
straw
the
middle
of
winter
no
work
nothing
to
eat
no
fire
no
clothes
no
warm
covering
and
crying
children
it
is
bitterly

dutch
has
always
been
my
favourite
study
and
many
people
say
that
i
am
thoroughly
at
home
in
it
but
heavens
fondness
for
a
language
is
a
very
long
way
from
knowledge
of
it
next
to
languages
i
like
geology
i
also
enjoy
mathematics
but
i
am
still
struggling
with
the
groundwork
of
history
not
that
i
do
not
like
history
i
think
it
is
interesting
and
very
instructive
but
the
manner
in
which
it
is
set
down
in
has
little
charm
for
me
i
should
like
to
have
a
teacher
who
knew
how
to
make
the
dry
parts
interesting
what
i
do
think
delightful
is
ancient
history
it
is
a
pity
that
so
little
of
it
has
come
my
way
i
should
love
to
study
the
history
of
the
egyptians
and
of
the
old
greeks
and
romans
we
do
not
wish
to
make
of
our
pupils
half
europeans
or
european
javanese
we
want
a
free
education
to
make
of
the
javanese
above
everything
a
strong
javanese
one
who
will
be
blessed
with
love
and
enthusiasm

i
read
in
the
paper
that
some
chinese
girls
had
asked
permission
to
stand
the
teachers
examinations
hurrah
for
progress
i
feel
like
shouting
aloud
in
my
joy
of
what
good
is
the
preservation
of
a
few
old
traditions
we
see
now
that
the
strongest
and
oldest
traditions
can
be
broken
and
that
gives
me
courage
and
hope
i
should
like
to
meet
the
gallant
little
chinese
girls
i
should
be
so
glad
to
know
something
of
their
thoughts
and
feelings
their
soul
i
have
always
longed
to
have
a
chinese
girl
for
a
friend
i
have
often
wondered
about
the
inner
life
of
such
a
girl
it
must
certainly
be
full
of
poetry
at
semarang
a
chinese
millionaire
has
laid
out
a
splendid
garden
it
lies
on
a
hill
and
is
so
beautiful
there
are
rocks
grottos
and
tiny
hills
covered
with
green
ferns
masses
of
flowers
and
miniature
fruit
trees
are
interspersed
with
little
parks
and
winding
paths
there
is
a
lovely
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
the
lake
has
many
capes
and
twisted
turns
and
in
it
goeromis
and
gold
fish
can
be
seen
swimming
around
on
the
shore
is
a
hill
with
a
grotto
and
a
bath
house
a
winding
stair
runs
through
the
grotto
and
comes
out
on
top
of
the
hill
where
two
miniature
temples
stand
fruit
trees
and
flowers
of
all
kinds
grow
and
bloom
everywhere
it
is
become
reality
only
the
fairy
kings
and
queens
and
the
silver
shining
little
elves
do
not
come
out
of
the
chasms
in
the
rocks
to
make
the
illusion
complete
the
whole
idea
is
like
a
poem
expressed
in
art
but
where
is
the
art
that
is
not
poetry
everything
that
is
good
that
is
high
that
is
holy
in
a
word
everything
that
is
beautiful
in
life
is
poetry
we
have
seen
the
creator
of
this
wonder
place
a
deadly
dull
commonplace
sjofele

images
in

human
dragons
and
tigers
are
scattered
among

these
too
are
the
creations
of

fancy
it
is
a
pity
that
at
the
entrance
of
the
walk
that
leads
to
the
fairy
lake
two
figures
of
european
workmanship
have
been
placed
they
destroy
the
harmony
you
have
been
to
batavia
to
see
the
exhibition

to
be
sure
and
what
do
you
say
now

the
brown
race
what
of
its
art
oh
i
am
so
proud
of
my
people
they
are
capable
of
so
much
but
you
hollanders
must
lead
us
and
you
will
do
that
will
you
not
we
are
like
children

you
are
our

must

in
four
years
before
this
letter
was
written
there
were
chinese
settlers
in
java
their
constantly
increasing
number
presents
a
problem
to
the
dutch
government
they
are
seldom
day
labourers
but
more
frequently
artisans
merchants
or
agriculturists
and
by
their
frugality
and
industry
have
attained
a
condition
of
general
prosperity
in
all
competition
easily
outstripping
the
more
indolent
javanese
and
often
accumulating
large

in
that
year
xli
father
and
mother
have
both
given
us
their
full
permission
we
had
expected
storms
and
lightning
flashes
i
can
not
yet
fully
realize
it
i
had
hoped
that
father
would
consent
but
i
had
not
dared
to
dream
that
mamma
would
stand
by
him
we
have
never
been
estranged
from
one
another
but
things
are
clearer
now
between
mamma
and
us
this
has
brought
us
nearer
together
i
felt
calm
at
first
but
when
mother
spoke
to
us
in
such
a
quiet
gentle
manner
my
calmness
vanished
i
had
so
much
in
my
mind
that
i
had
not
thought
over
what
i
should
say
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
the
words
fell
as
themselves
from
my
lips
who
was
it
that
placed
the
words
ready
in
my
mouth
who
there
is
a
power
higher
and
greater
than
all
earthly
powers
put
together
good
spirits
were
certainly
hovering
near
putting
the
words
in
our
mouths
when
we
stood
before
her
speaking
for
our
ideals
now
i
heard
mamma
say
deeply
moved
oh
child
why
have
you
not
trusted
me
we
have
done
wrong
not
to
have
told
mamma
everything
poor
dearest
mother
we
are
not
worthy
to
kiss
her
feet
i
wish
that
i
could
tell
you
what
mamma
has
been
to
us
all
these
long
years
what
she
still
is
now
we
realize
for
the
first
time
the
debt
that
we
owe
to
her
we
owe
her
a
world
full
of
love
and
gratitude
we
are
so
thankful
that
we
are
going
away
from
mamma
in
peace
in
the
service
of
that
good
that
she
herself
knows
and
understands
we
no
longer
express
our
joy
openly
as
formerly
as
we
did
only
a
little
while
ago
we
are
quiet
now
but
full
of
silent
gratitude
i
had
prepared
what
i
had
to
say
to
father
with
the
greatest
anxiety
i
do
not
know
where
i
got
the
calmness
and
composure
with
which
i
spoke
to
him
my
voice
sounded
strange
to
my
own
ears
i
was
unmoved
but
when
the
permission
for
which
i
was
pleading
was
granted
and
i
saw
how
much
it
cost
my
dear
father
the
melted
from
my
heart
i
longed
to
throw
my
arms
around
him
and
speak
words
of
comfort
but
my
knees
trembled
and
my
voice
refused
to
do
my
bidding
i
sat
before
him
on
the
ground
and
looked
at
him
with
the
mist
before
my
eyes
i
felt
his
pain
and
i
suffered
with
him
o
some
day
i
will
repay
for
everything
in
my
heart
the
prayer
rose
father
forgive
me
o
my
father
forgive
your
child
she
can
not
do
otherwise
it
was
on
the
of
june
i
chose
that
day
your
for
the
difficult
interview
with
father
i
wished
to
have
you
my
little
mother
with
me
in
spirit
good
angels
surrounded
me
my
heavenly
father
stood
by
me
in
my
struggle
against
my
earthly
one
when
i
was
alone
once
more
and
had
gained
my
desire
there
was
no
joy
in
my
heart
there
was
only
pity
and
sympathy
for
the
sorrow
of
one
whom
i
loved
my
tears
were
for
him
from
the
depth
of
my
soul
i
prayed
o
grant
that
from
this
great
sacrifice
of
my
parents
flowers
will
spring
up
and
fruit
will
grow
for
our
land
and
for
our
people
on
the
same
day
the
of
june
we
wrote
to
the
heer
van
kol
at
batavia
at
his
request
the
letters
contained
our
names
ages
and
a
summary
of
our
ideas
and
wishes
but
we
had
to
have
our
parents
permission
without
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
us
and
now
that
this
stumbling
block
is
cleared
from
our
way
we
stand
before
a
second
the
financial
one
our
parents
can
not
possibly
afford
the
expense
of
our
education
nor
would
we
ask
it
of
them
yesterday
i
received
a
long
and
very
earnest
letter
from
mevrouw
van
kol
if
i
did
not
need
to
keep
it
until
it
was
answered
and
if
my
unaccustomed
fingers
did
not
cling
to
it
so
i
should
like
to
send
it
to
you
but
i
shall
try
to
tell
you
something
of
its
contents
she
has
given
us
more
than
moral
support
she
has
given
us
part
of
herself
we
feel
as
though
we
had
received
a
benediction
we
are
no
longer
afraid
we
have
no
anxiety
we
are
at
peace
we
trust
and
we
believe
of
what
worth
are
we
we
are
no
more
than
the
dust
of
the
ground
we
feel
no
jubilant
boisterous
happiness
but
a
still
quiet
joy
o
god
we
are
so
thankful
that
we
have
found
thee
that
we
have
come
through
doubt
unbelief
and
materialism
we
have
thought
much
of
late
we
sought
the
light
afar
off
and
all
the
time
it
was
near
it
has
always
been
with
us
it
is
in
us
our
souls
have
been
working
and
growing
and
we
did
not
know
it
mevrouw
van
kol
has
drawn
back
the
curtain
from
before
our
eyes
we
are
more
grateful
to
her
for
that
than
for
all
the
other
things
which
have
been
done
for
us
before
i
received
her
letter
mamma
had
said
to
me
who
gave
you
such
ideas
and
i
answered
god
gave
them
to
me
it
was
only
natural
that
mother
should
try
to
hold
us
back
but
when
she
saw
that
we
would
never
change
that
we
could
not
change
she
said
to
us
with
resignation
well
children
i
shall
try
to
think
that
you
are
called
to
do
this
that
god
has
sent
you
for
this
service
mevrouw
van
kol
wrote
us
often
we
need
human
beings
and
their
support
but
there
are
many
more
times
when
it
is
only
god
that
we
need
he
has
called
each
one
of
us
to
do
our
special
work
and
he
gives
us
strength
and
constancy
believe
me
this
is
what
the
voice
of
experience
says
you
stand
now
at
the
threshhold
of
life
at
the
beginning
of
your
work
when
you
are
in
the
midst
of
it
then
you
too
will
have
had
experience
it
is
only
when
we
have
had
experience
that
we
become
free
and
strong
true
helpers
and
friends
of
mankind
depending
not
upon
them
but
upon
ourselves
and
upon
our
father
god
unasked
and
has
sent
us
assurances
of
its
support
and
mevrouw
van
kol
sent
us
the
paper
with
an
account
containing
a
description
of
the
journey
of
heer
stoll
and
where
the
writer
had
spoken
of
us
the
following
had
been
interpolated
east
and
we
trust
that
heer
van
kol
who
has
been
a
member
of
e
w
since
it
was
founded
will
not
have
neglected
to
tell
her
that
she
can
count
to
the
fullest
on
our
support
in
her
noble
struggle
after
she
had
seen
this
article
mevrouw
van
kol
sent
a
few
words
to
and
about
us
so
that
we
might
be
brought
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
javanese
loving
public
which
reads
e
she
has
asked
permission
to
publish
my
entire
letter
in
that
paper
i
do
not
like
the
idea
but
it
is
in
our
own
behalf
and
she
writes
further
how
can
the
friendly
public
know
what
is
in
your
heart
and
learn
to
appreciate
your
aspirations
better
than
from
a
candid
letter
in
which
the
young
javanese
lays
bare
her
soul
to
an
older
woman
from
whom
she
asks
support
and
sympathy
there
is
not
a
word
in
that
letter
that
the
public
ought
not
to
see
and
i
know
of
no
better
introduction
for
you
to
the
circle
that
has
the
welfare
of
java
and
of
the
javanese
at
heart
i
can
easily
understand
your
scruples
but
overcome
them
and
say
yes
i
have
come
to
no
decision
in
regard
to
this
i
must
first
have
consent
father
wants
me
to
keep
everything
secret
at
present
if
the
government
says
yes
then
the
world
can
hear
of
it
it
is
very
true
that
we
should
choose
our
way
with
all
prudence
but
experience
has
shown
us
lately
that
we
gain
more
by
publicity
than
by
secrecy
even
if
the
government
should
refuse
our
request
we
should
lose
nothing
how
many
petitions
are
never
reached
let
me
say
now
to
set
you
at
ease
that
we
will
always
remain
what
we
are
but
we
fervently
hope
with
you
that
it
may
be
granted
us
to
make
our
own
form
of
religion
admirable
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
think
differently
we
feel
that
the
kernel
of
all
religion
is
right
living
and
that
all
religion
is
good
and
beautiful
but
o
ye
peoples
what
have
ye
not
made
of
it
religion
is
designed
as
a
blessing
it
should
form
a
bond
between
all
the
creatures
of
god
white
or
brown
of
every
station
sex
and
belief
for
all
are
children
of
one
father
of
one
god
there
is
no
god
but
the
almighty
say
we
mohammedans
and
with
us
monotheists
god
is
the
master
the
creator
of
everything
children
of
one
father
and
for
that
reason
brothers
and
sisters
who
must
all
love
one
another
help
and
support
one
another
ah
if
this
were
but
understood
but
we
are
so
harnessed
down
by
form
that
we
are
sometimes
driven
against
all
religion
the
followers
of
one
dogma
look
down
upon
the
followers
of
another
despise
hate
and
sometimes
even
persecute
them
but
enough
of
this
for
the
present
is
there
a
dutch
translation
of
lessing
works
and
of
the
life
and
writings
of
pudita
ramabai
i
was
still
going
to
school
when
i
heard
of
this
courageous
indian
woman
for
the
first
time
i
remember
it
still
so
well
i
was
very
young
a
child
of
ten
or
eleven
when
glowing
with
enthusiasm
i
read
of
her
in
the
paper
i
trembled
with
excitement
not
alone
for
the
white
woman
is
it
possible
to
attain
an
independent
position
the
brown
indian
too
can
make
herself
free
for
days
i
thought
of
her
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
forget
her
see
what
one
good
brave
example
can
do
it
spreads
its
influence
so
far
to
mevrouw
xlii
no
cloud
lasts
for
ever
neither
is
there
such
a
thing
as
eternal
from
the
darkest
night
the
most
beautiful
morning
is
born
and
here
i
console
myself
human
life
is
a
true
reflection
of
the
life
of
nature
what
we
must
pray
for
day
and
night
is
strength
but
the
rain
which
makes
the
leaf
and
bud
of
one
plant
burst
forth
beats
another
into
the
earth
where
it
rots
to
mevrouw
abendanon
xliii
nellie
enthusiastic
article
in
and
has
been
copied
in
several
papers
here
one
in
the
also
contains
an
appeal
from
that
paper
asking
the
sympathy
and
of
all
women
in
india
the
quoted
just
as
did
nellie
a
few
words
from
my
letter
and
asked
our
permission
to
publish
it
all
or
a
part
of
it
i
think
it
would
be
better
not
to
publish
another
letter
one
is
enough
and
that
from
nellie
throws
full
light
upon
the
question
hilda
de
booj
the
daughter
of
heer
charles
boissevain
a
director
of
the
asked
if
she
could
publish
one
of
my
letters
about
a
javanese
wedding
she
sent
a
copy
of
this
letter
home
and
her
brother
advised
me
to
publish
it
such
personal
letters
will
show
the
netherlanders
that
the
javanese
are
in
some
respects
their
superiors
in
many
respects
their
equals
and
perhaps
in
many
others
their
inferiors
so
says
heer
boissevain
i
am
busy
now
with
an
article
for
en
i
hope
they
will
find
room
for
it
if
not
i
shall
send
it
to
some
other
paper
or
magazine
we
are
collecting
javanese
fairy
tales
for
nellie
and
sister
is
making
drawings
for
them
oh
i
hear
so
much
wisdom
and
truth
from
the
mouths
of
the
people
and
it
is
expressed
in
such
sweet
melodious
words
if
i
only
had
your
language
well
under
my
thumb
i
should
like
to
translate
the
beautiful
inspired
music
so
that
it
could
be
understood
and
appreciated
we
are
not
so
deep
by
nature
that
it
will
break
any
one
head
to
understand
our
wisdom
there
is
no
word
for
selfishness
in
our
language
happy
language
where
that
word
has
never
penetrated
i
wish
that
i
could
teach
you
my
language
so
that
you
could
enjoy
its
beauties
in
their
original
freshness
the
deeper
i
penetrate
the
soul
of
our
people
the
finer
i
think
it
among
you
wise
men
and
poets
are
drawn
usually
from
a
certain
station
and
only
the
upper
classes
are
educated
the
great
majority
are
may
i
say
it
crude
there
are
some
superior
spirits
among
the
lower
classes
but
the
many
stella
you
know
them
better
than
i
but
go
around
with
me
into
kampong
and
dessa
let
us
visit
the
small
huts
of
the
poor
submerged
tenth
let
us
listen
to
their
speech
seek
out
their
thoughts
they
are
an
unschooled
people
always
but
music
comes
welling
from
their
lips
they
are
tender
and
discreet
by
nature
simple
and
modest
if
i
am
ever
with
you
i
can
tell
you
much
of
our
gentle
people
you
must
learn
to
know
and
love
them
as
i
do
there
are
so
many
poets
and
artists
among
them
and
where
a
people
has
a
feeling
for
poetry
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
life
they
can
not
be
lacking
in
the
instincts
of
civilization
every
thing
that
is
high
and
fine
in
life
is
poetry
love
devotion
truth
belief
art
everything
that
elevates
and
ennobles
and
poetry
means
so
much
to
the
javanese
people
the
least
the
very
humblest
javanese
is
a
poet
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
deep
respect
which
children
have
for
their
parents
and
of
the
touching
piety
of
the
living
toward
the
dead
there
is
no
joyful
occasion
where
the
dead
are
not
called
to
our
remembrance
and
their
blessing
and
the
blessing
of
heaven
invoked
in
joy
and
in
sorrow
we
think
of
our
dead
always
and
the
name
of
mother
how
holy
that
is
in
hours
of
pain
and
doubt
the
pale
lips
always
murmur
that
name
it
is
mother
and
again
mother
who
is
called
upon
if
we
need
help
if
we
need
support
the
honour
of
motherhood
lies
in
this
in
the
calling
of
her
name
in
deep
sorrowful
hours
why
do
we
not
call
upon
our
father
why
just
our
mother
because
we
feel
from
childhood
instinctively
that
mother
means
a
world
of
love
and
devotion
each
object
that
falls
out
of
our
hands
is
picked
up
with
the
saying
oh
allah
my
child
do
i
have
to
explain
the
meaning
of
that
to
you
what
it
shows
stella
i
shall
work
earnestly
at
your
language
so
that
some
day
i
may
be
such
a
mistress
of
it
that
i
can
make
all
that
is
beautiful
among
our
people
clear
and
intelligible
to
the
outside
world
i
want
to
study
my
own
language
hard
as
well
i
want
to
teach
our
people
to
know
that
white
race
as
i
know
it
in
its
finer
nobler
aspects
they
must
learn
of
your
nobleness
of
your
greatness
so
that
they
will
honour
and
love
you
i
want
to
do
so
much
that
sometimes
i
wish
that
i
had
a
double
pair
of
hands
the
will
is
great
but
the
strength
is
little
and
i
must
not
injure
my
health
that
would
be
the
most
stupid
thing
that
i
could
do
and
yet
i
am
often
stupid
sometimes
sitting
and
working
till
late
at
night
and
that
is
not
good
for
me
i
may
defeat
my
own
object
if
in
the
end
it
should
do
me
harm
and
i
could
not
overcome
my
bodily
weakness
so
i
am
doing
my
best
to
live
soberly
and
sensibly
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
mevrouw
nellie
van
kol
xliv
hurrah
for
our
native
art
and
industry
they
are
well
started
now
on
the
road
to
a
splendid
future
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
we
like
to
admire
our
own
people
and
it
is
so
easy
to
make
us
proud
of
them
the
future
of
our
javanese
artists
is
assured
heer
zimmerman
was
in
ecstasies
over
the
work
that
he
saw
here
by
the
despised
brown
race
wood
carving
the
art
of
the
gold
smith
and
textile
weaving
have
reached
a
high
degree
of
excellence
our
artists
here
have
received
a
large
order
from
and
for
nicholas
we
are
delighted
now
the
clever
artist
can
bring
out
new
ideas
and
express
his
poetic
thoughts
in
graceful
undulating
lines
and
in
ravishing
glowing
changing
colours
oh
it
is
splendid
above
everything
else
to
seek
the
beautiful
a
spark
of
god
is
everywhere
even
when
things
outwardly
appear
most
evil
there
was
once
a
child
who
went
to
an
old
woman
who
asked
her
what
she
would
like
to
have
for
the
little
one
had
neither
sweets
nor
ornaments
nor
clothes
but
the
child
said
oh
mother
give
me
a
flower
that
opens
in
the
heart
how
do
you
like
that
you
must
see
it
in
the
original
the
answer
of
the
child
sounds
so
sweet
there
is
a
deep
meaning
in
bloementaal
njoewoen
sekar
melati
hingkang
mekar
hing
poendjering
ati
that
is
what
one
hears
all
the
time
we
are
now
busy
writing
down
everything
interesting
that
we
hear
from
the
mouths
of
the
people
there
is
no
word
for
poetry
in
our
language
we
say
bloementaal
and
is
it
not
well
said
we
are
learning
songs
not
songs
of
rejoicing
have
you
ever
heard
one
of
that
kind
from
a
javanese
the
gamelan
never
rejoices
even
at
the
most
extravagant
festivals
its
tone
is
mournful
perhaps
that
is
well
life
is
mournful
not
a
song
of
rejoicing
these
pages
have
been
written
under
the
influence
of
sweet
and
sad
singing
it
is
evening
windows
and
doors
are
open
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
blooming
tjempaka
beyond
our
chamber
comes
to
greet
us
with
the
cool
breeze
that
rustles
through
its
branches
i
sat
upon
the
floor
just
as
i
do
now
at
a
long
low
table
at
my
left
was
sister
roekmini
also
writing
to
the
right
of
me
was
annie
glazer
she
too
on
the
floor
before
me
was
a
woman
who
read
from
a
book
of
songs
they
were
very
beautiful
and
the
pure
serene
sonorous
tones
seemed
to
carry
our
souls
far
away
nearer
to
the
realm
of
the
blessed
how
i
wish
that
you
could
be
sitting
there
with
us
in
that
little
circle
you
would
have
felt
with
us
and
dreamed
with
us
dreams
life
is
not
a
dream
it
is
cold
sober
reality
but
even
reality
does
not
have
to
be
ugly
unless
we
make
it
so
it
is
not
ugly
it
is
beautiful
we
always
have
beauty
within
us
this
is
the
reason
that
i
wish
that
in
education
emphasis
were
laid
upon
character
forming
and
first
of
all
upon
the
cultivation
of
strength
of
will
it
should
be
instilled
into
the
child
but
i
am
wandering
from
my
subject
this
time
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
about
our
people
and
not
about
education
there
is
an
old
woman
here
from
whom
i
have
gathered
many
flowers
that
spring
from
the
heart
she
has
already
given
me
much
and
has
still
more
to
give
and
i
wish
for
more
always
more
she
is
willing
but
first
i
must
earn
her
treasures
i
must
buy
her
flowers
why
why
must
i
pay
solemnly
the
words
sounded
from
her
lips
fast
a
day
and
a
night
and
pass
that
time
awake
and
in
solitude
door
nacht
tot
licht
door
storm
tot
rust
door
strijd
tot
eer
door
leed
tot
lust
sounds
like
a
requiem
in
my
ears
the
meaning
behind
the
words
of
the
old
woman
is
fasting
and
waking
are
symbolical
through
abstinence
and
meditation
we
go
toward
the
light
no
light
where
darkness
has
not
gone
before
do
you
not
think
that
a
beautiful
thought
fasting
is
the
overcoming
of
the
material
by
the
spirit
solitude
is
the
school
of
meditation
as
a
child
i
did
everything
mechanically
without
question
because
others
around
me
did
the
same
thing
then
a
time
came
when
my
mind
began
to
question
why
do
i
do
that
why
is
so
and
so
why
why
it
is
endless
i
would
not
do
things
mechanically
without
knowing
the
reason
i
would
not
learn
any
more
lessons
from
the
koran
saying
sentences
in
a
strange
language
whose
meaning
i
did
not
understand
and
which
probably
my
teachers
themselves
did
not
understand
tell
me
the
meaning
and
i
am
willing
to
learn
everything
i
was
wrong
the
book
of
books
is
too
holy
to
be
comprehended
by
our
poor
intelligence
we
would
not
fast
and
do
other
things
which
seemed
senseless
to
us
every
one
was
in
despair
we
were
in
despair
no
one
could
explain
the
things
which
were
incomprehensible
to
us
our
god
was
our
conscience
our
hell
and
our
heaven
too
was
our
own
conscience
if
we
did
wrong
our
conscience
punished
us
if
we
did
good
our
conscience
rewarded
us
the
years
came
and
went
we
were
called
mohammedans
because
we
had
inherited
that
faith
and
we
were
mohammedans
in
name
no
more
god
allah
was
for
us
a
name
a
word
a
sound
without
meaning
now
we
have
found
him
for
whom
unconsciously
our
souls
had
yearned
during
the
long
years
we
had
sought
so
far
and
so
long
we
did
not
know
that
it
was
near
that
it
was
always
with
us
that
it
was
in
us
it
had
been
working
in
us
unconsciously
for
a
long
time
but
she
who
opened
the
door
for
which
we
had
sought
was
nellie
van
kol
and
who
leads
us
now
and
shows
us
the
way
toward
him
it
is
mamma
we
have
been
so
stupid
all
our
lives
we
have
had
a
whole
mountain
of
treasure
under
our
hands
and
we
have
not
known
it
foolish
headstrong
pedantic
persons
that
we
were
we
reproach
ourselves
now
for
our
own
conceit
and
self
sufficiency
we
say
to
console
ourselves
it
has
pleased
god
to
open
your
hearts
at
last
be
thankful
for
that
god
alone
understands
the
riddle
of
the
world
it
is
he
that
brings
together
paths
that
were
far
asunder
for
the
forming
of
new
roads
to

flower
tongue
through
night
to
light
through

to
rest
through

to
peace
through

xlv
good
morning
here
comes
sister
to
prattle
to
you
again
it
is
a
splendid
fresh
morning
and
i
am
sitting
here
in
a
cosy
corner
by
the
window
where
i
have
a
view
of
the
garden
another
time
i
shall
try
and
describe
all
our
surroundings
to
you
our
home
which
is
our
doenia
little
world
and
our
cloister
now
however
i
shall
continue
my
talk
of
yesterday
it
is
pathetic
to
see
the
joy
of
our
elders
over
the
return
of
the
strayed
sheep
out
of
pure
joy
an
old
woman
here
sent
us
her
collection
of
books
old
javanese
manuscripts
many
written
in
arabic
characters
we
are
going
to
study
arabic
so
that
we
can
read
and
write
it
you
know
perhaps
that
javanese
books
are
very
rare
and
hard
to
find
because
they
are
written
with
the
hand
only
a
few
of
them
are
printed
we
are
reading
now
a
lovely
poem
in
the
how
i
wish
that
you
knew
our
language
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
could
enjoy
all
our
fine
things
in
the
original
have
you
any
desire
to
learn
the
javanese
language
it
is
difficult
certainly
but
it
is
beautiful
it
is
a
sentient
language
often
the
words
seem
to
be
conscious
they
express
so
much
we
are
astonished
sometimes
own
children
as
we
are
of
the
country
at
the
cleverness
of
our
fellow
countrymen
things
of
which
one
could
never
imagine
anything
could
be
made
they
express
charmingly
name
something
in
the
dark
give
out
a
subject
at
random
and
a
simple
javanese
will
immediately
make
a
rhyme
that
astonishes
by
its
aptness
and
clearness
this
facility
belongs
peculiarly
to
our
eastern
people
it
is
a
pity
that
when
the
precious
gifts
were
meted
out
your
sisters
should
have
been
neglected
that
is
not
fishing
for
a
compliment
we
mean
it
literally
as
one
can
see
though
one
fairy
gave
us
wit
in
wise
another
sister
fairy
has
made
reparation
by
endowing
us
richly
with
her
gift
of
sensibility
i
do
not
think
so
very
much
of
her
gift
myself
and
we
have
to
take
good
care
that
this
virtue
does
not
degenerate
into
a
vice
a
certain
amount
of
feeling
is
good
but
you
will
soon
see
if
you
have
not
seen
already
that
it
is
often
hard
for
your
sisters
to
keep
themselves
in
the
golden
middle
way
it
is
very
difficult
for
one
who
naturally
goes
to
extremes
now
that
you
know
all
my
faults
here
is
a
prayer
try
to
understand
them
help
me
to
overcome
them
will
you
not
do
that
your
sisters
know
of
things
in
themselves
that
are
not
good
after
having
had
days
of
rain
we
went
out
one
morning
to
see
how
our
flower
children
were
getting
along
we
were
afraid
that
they
would
have
suffered
from
the
rain
but
we
found
our
full
of
green
buds
the
days
came
and
the
days
went
our
roses
were
full
of
luxuriant
leaves
and
of
beautiful
blossoms
rain
rain
they
needed
it
before
they
could
bear
those
splendid
blossoms
rain
rain
the
soul
needs
it
in
order
to
grow
and
to
blossom
now
we
know
that
our
tears
of
today
serve
only
to
nourish
the
seed
from
which
another
higher
joy
will
bloom
in
the
future
do
not
struggle
do
not
complain
and
curse
sorrow
when
it
comes
to
you
it
is
right
for
sorrow
to
exist
in
the
world
too
it
has
its
mission
bow
your
head
submissively
before
suffering
it
brings
out
the
good
that
is
in
the
heart
but
the
same
fire
which
purines
gold
turns
wood
into
ashes
now
i
want
to
tell
you
how
it
was
that
we
happened
to
get
into
touch
with
nellie
van
kol
perhaps
you
have
already
read
something
about
it
in
the
paper
one
evening
in
the
latter
part
of
april
we
had
a
visit
from
the
heer
van
kol
he
was
sent
to
us
by
a
dutch
lady
who
has
much
sympathy
for
the
cause
of
your
sisters
it
was
one
of
the
most
pleasant
meetings
of
our
whole
lives
already
long
ago
he
had
won
our
esteem
through
what
he
has
been
to
java
and
the
javanese
but
the
personal
meeting
secured
for
him
a
place
in
our
love
it
is
delightful
to
meet
superior
people
it
was
a
great
occasion
in
our
lives
when
we
met
your
dear
parents
it
was
a
turning
point
for
us
it
waked
us
up
to
reality
before
that
we
had
only
seemed
to
live
we
had
been
asleep
always
sleeping
and
dreaming
now
we
are
alive
fighting
and
struggling
hoping
despairing
suffering
and
rejoicing
weeping
and
laughing
that
is
life
we
have
climbed
to
the
heights
of
joy
and
we
have
descended
into
the
depths
of
misery
i
am
happy
just
to
be
alive
i
have
heard
from
your
mother
that
you
sympathize
with
our
struggles
and
ideas
and
you
have
told
us
so
yourself
so
it
will
certainly
please
you
to
know
there
are
others
who
are
interested
in
our
cause
superior
people
like
heer
van
kol
and
his
wife
we
told
the
heer
van
kol
everything
it
was
to
hear
about
our
plans
that
he
had
come
and
he
promised
to
support
our
endeavours
with
all
his
might
just
as
your
father
has
promised
to
do
are
you
not
glad
that
the
cause
of
your
sisters
has
found
a
warm
defender
in
holland
in
the
council
halls
of
the
country
he
will
do
everything
that
he
can
to
help
us
he
asked
us
if
we
would
not
write
to
his
wife
she
would
prove
a
true
faithful
advisor
he
spoke
of
his
wife
with
such
love
and
respect
he
called
her
his
guide
and
his
counsellor
it
touched
us
to
hear
a
man
and
such
a
man
speak
so
of
a
woman
would
that
there
were
more
such
men
who
would
see
the
highest
in
woman
and
honour
her
for
it
i
did
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
immediately
after
he
had
left
i
wrote
to
his
wife
was
it
instinct
i
wonder
for
when
i
was
writing
to
her
i
had
no
feeling
at
all
that
it
was
to
an
utter
stranger
which
was
the
fact
it
had
been
the
same
way
when
i
was
talking
to
her
husband
as
though
she
had
been
my
mother
i
blurted
out
without
reserve
just
what
i
felt
it
was
easy
to
be
frank
with
her
husband
for
he
was
so
modest
so
friendly
met
us
so
cordially
and
was
so
fatherly
towards
us
i
am
glad
that
i
followed
the
voice
of
my
heart
and
wrote
at
once
to
mevrouw
van
kol
we
received
a
letter
from
her
at
once
and
such
a
letter
we
feel
ourselves
rich
in
her
sympathy
god
has
given
us
as
a
gift
the
heart
of
a
true
friend
and
through
that
friend
heart
he
has
found
us
himself
if
i
could
only
tell
you
how
happy
we
are
we
will
find
the
right
human
friends
when
we
cease
to
seek
for
support
among
men
but
depend
upon
ourselves
and
upon
our
father
god
we
are
deeply
grateful
to
nellie
for
that
again
she
says
the
loveliest
and
best
among
us
are
but
weak
blundering
creatures
nestle
on
your
heart
he
will
heal
your
wounds
and
dry
your
tears
in
the
days
since
i
have
begun
this
letter
something
very
unpleasant
has
happened
before
our
acquaintance
with
nellie
it
would
have
plunged
us
into
despair
but
now
it
is
different
we
do
not
seek
consolation
from
men
we
hold
fast
to
his
hand
and
then
the
darkness
becomes
light
and
the
storm
wind
a
gentle
breeze
we
are
not
afraid
we
are
never
afraid
wherever
we
may
be
there
is
a
father
that
watches
over
us
who
judges
us
with
love
we
are
ready
for
anything
for
there
is
no
light
where
darkness
does
not
go
before
the
dawn
is
born
out
of
the
night
now
that
we
have
found
him
our
whole
lives
are
changed
our
work
seems
nobler
higher
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
edie
i
know
one
thing
for
certain
that
you
are
glad
for
your
sisters
i
have
still
other
things
to
prattle
about
and
then
i
must
let
this
letter
go
otherwise
it
will
grow
stale
and
it
is
too
long
already
perhaps
it
seems
very
formidable
to
you
honestly
tell
me
the
truth
candour
must
be
the
basis
of
our
friendship
do
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
something
because
it
might
give
me
pain
when
you
know
that
it
would
be
wholesome
for
me
from
you
we
did
not
expect
anything
else
but
that
you
would
not
allow
the
workmen
under
your
orders
to
be
beaten
we
share
to
the
fullest
your
ideas
in
the
matter
i
can
not
bear
to
see
any
one
struck
it
hurts
me
so
to
see
the
beast
in
man
unfettered
hot
tempered
the
man
made
lower
than
the
beast
we
can
not
understand
how
men
and
even
women
can
go
to
see
an
execution
it
is
worse
than
heartless
you
know
very
well
that
unfortunate
convicts
are
often
beaten
with
rods
they
are
cruel
people
that
willingly
encourage
the
infliction
of
such
punishment
it
is
bad
in
the
javanese
but
still
worse
in
the
european
when
he
so
debases
himself
i
have
seen
a
certainly
not
stupid
in
fact
a
highly
educated
european
at
a
festival
of
the
people
let
first
a
child
and
after
that
a
woman
and
a
young
girl
make
the
acquaintance
of
his
stick
in
a
most
frightful
manner
because
the
blunderers
had
not
been
deft
enough
in
getting
out
of
the
great
man
way
i
ground
my
teeth
together
to
keep
from
crying
out
aloud
each
blow
pierced
me
through
the
soul
it
is
not
the
idea
of
pain
that
makes
me
abhor
bodily
punishment
but
the
deep
humiliation
that
the
victim
must
feel
and
also
the
harm
it
does
to
the
one
who
punishes
physical
punishment
embitters
but
never
cures
that
is
our
conviction
as
children
of
a
ruler
in
a
community
where
the
idea
is
fast
rooted
that
a
randen
mas
or
a
raden
adjeng
is
absolutely
a
being
of
a
higher
order
to
whom
a
reverence
is
due
from
the
people
we
have
oftener
than
we
would
been
among
scenes
that
made
us
tremble
with
exasperation
at
such
times
we
are
struck
dumb
and
stand
still
as
death
we
can
neither
speak
nor
smile
indignation
and
pity
hold
our
mouths
fast
closed
an
acquaintance
of
ours
once
said
we
must
do
it
well
how
otherwise
will
our
little
handful
be
able
to
keep
peace
and
order
among
thousands
had
they
not
been
afraid
of
us
they
would
long
ago
have
hunted
us
from
the
land
and
driven
us
into
the
sea
obedience
through
fear
when
will
the
time
come
when
the
rule
which
is
called
love
will
penetrate
millions
and
millions
of
hearts
one
thousand
nine
hundred
and
two
years
ago
the
beautiful
law
of
love
was
preached
but
how
many
thousand
years
must
pass
before
love
will
come
into
its
own
not
only
among
the
elect
but
among
the
multitudes
your
mother
knows
the
whole
history
of
our
lives
has
she
ever
told
you
of
our
childhood
years
when
we
lived
under
the
despotic
sway
of
older
brothers
and
sisters
among
us
it
is
a
law
the
younger
ones
must
submit
to
the
older
in
everything
that
was
not
for
sister
kartini
even
in
her
early
years
the
desire
for
freedom
had
awakened
the
result
was
that
i
was
somewhat
out
of
harmony
with
my
older
brothers
and
sisters
because
i
submitted
to
them
only
when
i
saw
a
reason
in
what
they
thought
good
so
i
stood
there
a
child
of
twelve
years
alone
against
a
hostile
power
bitter
bitter
tears
were
wept
by
us
as
children
do
you
know
who
has
always
been
our
friend
our
help
and
our
support
kartono
but
most
of
the
time
he
was
not
at
home
he
was
at
semarang
our
friendship
is
quite
old
you
see
it
goes
back
to
our
earliest
youth
my
eldest
sister
married
my
older
brother
went
away
and
then
we
began
a
new
life
the
watchword
was
freedom
equality
and
fraternity
we
wished
to
be
loved
not
feared
it
is
not
a
boast
but
every
one
knows
that
our
little
ones
would
rather
be
with
us
than
with
the
others
love
is
the
bond
which
binds
us
together
and
how
our
little
ones
love
us
they
have
taught
us
much
those
who
embittered
our
childish
years
were
also
our
teachers
for
they
taught
us
to
avoid
being
like
themselves
another
proof
that
sorrow
justifies
its
existence
those
who
formerly
opposed
us
now
come
to
us
with
love
and
friendship
they
do
not
tell
us
so
in
words
but
deeds
bear
witness
in
every
letter
our
sister
asks
us
to
come
and
visit
her
our
presence
does
good
both
to
her
and
to
her
house
she
says
always
god
is
great
god
is
powerful
could
not
that
bit
of
our
life
history
become
the
life
history
of
two
peoples
of
the
hollanders
and
of
the
javanese
would
it
not
be
possible
for
nothing
but
mutual
love
and
respect
to
bind
the
netherlands
and
java
together
how
this
happy
state
of
affairs
has
come
about
in
our
own
family
i
do
not
know
i
protest
i
do
not
know
many
times
the
question
has
been
asked
us
but
we
only
know
that
we
have
much
love
in
our
hearts
and
that
is
the
whole
secret
i
believe
now
best
brother
i
hope
sincerely
that
this
long
discourse
will
not
frighten
you
away
from
a
further
correspondence
with
your
sisters
and
that
you
will
take
it
as
a
proof
of
our
good
intentions
when
we
say
that
we
look
upon
you
as
our
brother
and
our
friend
we
hope
that
many
letters
from
sawah
loento
with
japara
as
destination
will
be
forthcoming
tell
us
about
everything
your
work
your
life
and
your
environment
it
is
a
pity
that
photography
is
such
a
luxury
for
we
should
be
glad
to
take
some
peeps
for
the
benefit
of
our
friends
into
typical
javanese
customs
we
as
children
of
the
country
can
go
everywhere
here
with
a
freedom
that
would
not
be
allowed
to
you
to
heer
abendanon
xlvi
lately
we
have
received
some
people
from
batavia
who
admire
the
art
of
our
people
and
who
wish
to
do
much
for
it
they
were
heads
of
the
governing
board
of
and
in
india
who
wished
to
have
examples
of
native
art
for
santa
claus
sinterklaas
and
were
anxious
for
japara
to
be
well
represented
we
have
been
busy
with
that
work
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
us
to
be
able
to
work
for
the
furtherance
of
our
art
we
think
it
a
great
privilege
to
be
the
avenue
through
which
some
of
these
expressions
of
their
soul
find
a
way
into
a
new
world
works
of
art
that
compel
wonder
and
admiration
are
made
by
the
despised
javanese
whom
the
world
in
its
simplicity
has
patronized
when
one
looks
at
the
splendid
examples
which
we
have
and
after
that
sees
their
simple
creator
and
the
primitive
tools
with
which
he
works
one
is
filled
with
reverence
for
his
work
and
feels
instinctively
that
here
one
is
face
to
face
with
a
true
artist
once
when
we
were
in
ecstacies
over
something
which
he
had
made
we
said
to
him
oh
where
did
you
get
such
beautiful
designs
the
lowered
eyes
were
raised
and
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
he
answered
from
my
heart
bendoro
we
were
delighted
at
his
answer
and
afterwards
we
laughed
so
at
ourselves
because
we
had
sat
upon
the
steps
and
he
was
in
a
respectful
attitude
upon
the
ground
humbling
himself
before
us
to
whom
he
was
a
hundred
fold
superior
it
is
splendid
that
through
the
untiring
efforts
of
yourself
and
some
others
the
eyes
of
the
netherlands
are
beginning
to
be
opened
to
that
important
part
of
a
child
education
reading
holland
may
well
congratulate
herself
that
she
possesses
such
noble
strength
which
sets
itself
with
heart
and
soul
toward
the
forming
of
the
mind
and
spirit
of
her
youth
and
in
that
respect
the
dutch
child
is
far
more
fortunate
than
the
javanese
who
possesses
no
books
except
we
were
still
children
when
an
inspector
of
native
education
asked
us
to
write
little
narratives
of
native
child
life
which
were
to
appear
in
small
illustrated
books
we
had
not
the
least
idea
when
we
wrote
the
sketches
that
some
day
the
pioneer
of
the
noble
movement
in
holland
to
give
the
children
good
literature
would
ask
us
to
bring
a
little
stone
for
the
building
of
that
tower
which
is
rising
so
high
in
the
pure
air
a
tower
full
of
clear
undimmed
windows
looking
on
all
the
expanse
of
heaven
which
she
is
erecting
for
her
loved
ones
the
youth
the
men
of
the
future
we
are
busy
now
collecting
fairly
tales
fables
games
and
songs
for
her
it
will
not
be
easy
to
write
down
the
fairy
tales
and
the
little
games
in
the
first
place
though
we
love
music
very
much
to
our
great
sorrow
we
know
nothing
about
it
because
we
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
study
it
the
greatest
difficulty
lies
in
this
we
have
an
entirely
different
musical
scale
from
you
and
in
it
there
are
chords
for
which
we
seek
in
vain
in
european
music
only
last
week
we
talked
with
a
man
who
has
spent
twenty
years
collecting
songs
and
poetry
of
all
kinds
among
the
indian
people
he
has
collected
all
conceivable
forms
even
rhymes
and
jingles
now
he
is
so
anxious
to
have
some
javanese
songs
in
his
collection
but
so
far
he
has
not
been
able
to
write
them
into
music
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
which
i
spoke
but
gamelan
music
is
very
difficult
and
the
children
songs
and
rhymes
are
simple
we
tried
some
of
them
on
the
piano
and
they
went
quite
well
it
would
seem
as
though
an
invisible
telephone
cable
ran
from
here
to
lali
djawa
and
back
again
otherwise
we
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
that
so
many
things
of
which
you
spoke
in
your
letter
were
already
answered
in
ours
before
we
received
it
in
my
letter
which
crossed
yours
you
will
find
many
of
your
questions
answered
we
had
even
written
you
of
the
songs
games
and
fairy
tales
it
will
be
so
unfortunate
if
we
can
not
give
the
songs
for
the
charm
lies
in
the
music
as
children
we
did
not
enjoy
our
fairy
tales
if
the
narrator
could
not
sing
we
have
been
having
a
heated
controversy
about
the
influence
of
books
our
adversary
thought
that
idealism
was
all
nonsense
poetry
was
silly
a
book
nothing
not
of
the
slightest
value
we
were
delighted
the
next
morning
when
we
opened
the
to
find
your
delightful
article
on
the
influence
of
books
we
are
novices
triflers
our
judgment
is
worth
nothing
but
now
we
have
an
authority
on
the
subject
he
is
a
very
peculiar
man
and
it
interests
him
to
strike
at
our
innermost
convictions
he
likes
to
try
to
analyze
our
deductions
he
is
a
man
of
many
good
qualities
but
so
weak
through
him
we
see
still
more
plainly
why
a
child
should
first
of
all
be
educated
in
strength
of
will
without
strength
all
other
good
qualities
are
of
little
worth
i
can
not
tell
you
how
thankful
we
are
that
you
have
shown
us
the
way
to
true
happiness
to
true
freedom
to
god
those
who
serve
god
are
free
they
are
bound
to
no
man
to
be
dependent
upon
others
is
to
be
in
bondage
to
them
where
is
true
happiness
it
is
not
far
away
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
find
the
road
thither
we
can
not
go
by
tram
by
horse
or
by
boat
and
no
gold
can
pay
the
cost
of
the
journey
it
is
hard
to
find
the
way
and
we
must
pay
the
fare
in
tears
and
heart
blood
and
meditation
where
is
the
road
it
is
in
ourselves
in
the
world
we
find
much
that
delights
us
that
transports
us
so
that
we
think
we
have
found
the
long
sought
happiness
but
even
as
the
thought
comes
we
find
by
bitter
experience
that
what
we
hold
to
our
hearts
is
empty
dross
true
lasting
happiness
dwells
within
and
is
called
soul
peace
we
have
learned
of
that
from
you
god
is
jealous
it
is
said
he
will
not
suffer
us
to
pray
to
any
other
gods
but
him
and
he
punishes
with
bitter
disillusion
those
who
create
gods
for
themselves
and
pray
to
them
with
reverence
so
we
think
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
me
a
command
of
love
in
it
there
lies
an
earnest
admonition
that
man
is
man
and
but
a
fallible
creature
alas
if
that
commandment
were
only
understood
so
much
suffering
would
be
spared
us
mother
says
that
she
would
like
to
meet
you
to
thank
you
personally
for
the
miracle
that
you
have
wrought
in
her
children
in
opening
their
hearts
to
the
father
of
love
you
ask
what
had
turned
us
into
unbelievers
the
things
that
we
had
seen
lurking
under
the
mantle
of
religion
and
oh
the
intolerance
of
so
many
strong
believers
we
were
children
how
can
one
understand
the
thoughts
of
a
child
we
did
not
know
could
not
understand
that
it
is
man
who
does
evil
using
name
to
cover
his
wicked
deeds
we
asked
and
still
ask
for
that
matter
not
what
is
your
belief
but
what
is
the
conduct
of
your
life
righteousness
was
our
god
now
we
know
that
god
and
righteousness
are
one
we
are
reading
a
beautiful
poem
it
is
in
the
there
is
no
word
for
poetry
in
our
language
so
we
say
and
is
it
not
expressive
all
our
books
are
in
poetic
metre
and
can
be
either
read
or
sung
do
you
remember
the
cool
bright
tropical
evenings
when
everything
was
quiet
and
the
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
rustling
of
the
wind
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
when
the
fresh
evening
breeze
brought
you
on
its
breath
the
sweet
perfume
of
kemoening
tjempaka
melati
did
a
dreamy
song
never
reach
you
then
the
song
of
a
javanese
who
sings
to
his
family
and
to
his
neighbours
of
love
heroic
deeds
and
glittering
pageantry
of
beauty
and
of
wisdom
of
mighty
men
and
women
princes
and
princesses
of
the
long
ago
it
is
that
loveliest
hour
when
the
javanese
tired
from
the
hard
day
work
seeks
rest
in
song
dreaming
all
his
cares
away
wholly
lost
in
the
shining
past
whither
his
song
leads
him
the
javanese
are
a
people
who
live
in
the
past
a
young
friend
of
ours
says
rightly
they
are
lost
in
the
blissful
dreams
of
their
eternal
sleep
that
is
true
but
we
are
alive
we
must
live
and
life
always
goes
forward
our
friend
says
too
your
people
must
be
awakened
to
a
practical
realization
of
the
outside
world
many
things
that
are
dear
to
us
will
then
be
driven
into
the
background
but
should
we
for
that
reason
delay
the
awakening
dreams
are
splendid
but
what
would
become
of
us
if
we
dreamed
for
ever
we
must
make
ourselves
nobler
by
trying
to
make
our
dreams
real
there
is
so
much
charm
in
the
javanese
people
you
have
been
the
means
of
making
us
realize
it
anew
in
the
last
few
days
this
collecting
of
fables
brings
us
into
contact
with
many
kinds
of
people
and
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
find
out
their
ideas
they
tell
them
to
us
in
simple
language
but
they
tell
them
so
graciously
and
we
are
moved
by
their
truth
and
wisdom
i
wish
that
i
could
send
you
some
of
their
beautiful
thoughts
in
our
own
soft
musical
tongue
translated
they
are
no
longer
what
they
were
we
tell
you
too
much
about
our
people
do
we
not
but
what
a
question
it
answers
itself
we
know
that
you
are
glad
to
know
of
them
and
that
you
love
them
sincerely
we
believe
with
you
that
the
essential
thing
is
the
spirit
and
not
the
world
we
are
so
rich
and
so
happy
with
the
spirit
friends
that
we
have
is
it
selfish
to
want
to
learn
from
each
one
of
them
to
improve
ourselves
by
correspondence
with
those
who
nourish
and
broaden
our
minds
we
think
it
abominable
to
receive
and
to
have
to
answer
letters
about
nothing
epistles
that
make
one
ask
why
were
they
written
we
are
certainly
privileged
to
be
in
touch
with
so
many
superior
minds
deep
in
the
heart
of
celebes
we
have
a
noble
friend
we
admire
him
sincerely
for
his
great
work
it
is
always
a
holiday
for
us
when
we
receive
a
letter
from
adriani
his
letters
are
as
interesting
as
they
are
learned
we
met
him
when
we
were
visiting
the
abendanons
mevrouw
brought
us
together
knowing
how
much
we
should
value
the
acquaintance
when
we
are
distressed
by
the
heartlessness
of
others
the
mere
thought
of
him
is
a
consolation
the
selfishness
of
people
hurts
us
often
it
is
boundless
it
is
such
a
delight
to
meet
now
and
then
among
or
indifferent
people
many
without
heart
or
head
either
a
being
who
is
all
enthusiasm
and
heroic
strength
we
are
so
sorry
that
you
did
not
know
us
in
the
full
glow
of
our
triple
bond
we
were
three
souls
welded
together
one
in
thought
and
feeling
living
side
by
side
in
life
as
sisters
storms
passed
over
the
young
heads
storms
raged
in
the
young
hearts
i
think
of
your
in
order
to
reach
our
ideals
we
must
lay
down
many
illusions
from
the
death
of
young
spring
blossoms
the
strong
fruit
ripens
it
is
so
with
human
life
is
it
not
from
the
death
of
young
illusions
sometimes
mature
ones
rise
up
which
ripen
and
bring
forth
fruit
we
have
laid
down
a
great
illusion
it
was
a
bitter
miserable
hour
we
buried
it
in
our
heart
blood
but
still
we
felt
as
though
we
were
being
rushed
along
as
by
a
river
which
was
carrying
us
forward
to
fresh
strong
life
we
know
that
many
tears
must
be
shed
to
water
the
young
fruit
and
bring
it
to
full
growth
we
are
beginning
now
to
understand
what
abendanon
meant
when
he
told
us
that
through
his
wife
what
was
formerly
dark
to
us
has
meaning
now
yes
we
shall
only
be
able
to
move
slowly
the
journey
is
long
and
the
way
steep
and
difficult
the
idea
of
personal
suffering
does
not
trouble
us
but
if
it
should
react
upon
ourselves
and
in
that
way
impede
our
cause
it
would
be
terrible
i
think
of
a
certain
evening
not
long
ago
an
acquaintance
took
both
of
us
to
a
concert
at
the
at
semarang
it
was
the
first
time
that
we
two
had
ever
in
our
whole
lives
been
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
great
sea
of
humanity
without
sister
without
father
without
mother
both
of
us
absolutely
alone
with
all
those
strange
faces
we
had
the
same
thought
so
shall
our
life
be
in
the
future
we
two
alone
on
the
great
sea
of
life
but
we
are
comforted
there
is
a
god
who
will
watch
over
us
on
the
twentieth
of
this
month
we
were
at
tandjong
priok
in
thought
we
saw
the
steam
away
from
the
coast
of
java
carrying
as
a
precious
freight
java
great
friend
and
warm
supporter
to
the
distant
netherlands
he
is
already
known
in
the
assembly
of
that
country
so
that
when
he
speaks
in
the
interests
of
the
millions
of
children
in
this
land
his
words
will
have
authority
and
weight
take
him
safely
for
the
sake
of
these
lands
and
for
the
sake
of
his
dear
family
and
now
true
best
counsellor
our
highly
honoured
and
dearly
loved
friend
we
thank
you
many
times
for
your
letter
it
did
us
much
good
in
every
way
it
encouraged
us
to
earnest
us
and
opened
up
new
vistas
of
thought
to
us
to
mevrouw
van
kol
bendoro
means
master
it
is
also
used
to
women
of
high
rank
jules
le
garcq
says
of
javanese
music
that
it
is
full
of
charm
and
produces
a
sweet
melody
incomprehensible
to
european
ears
and
that
far
from
being
barbaric
it
makes
one
realize
that
it
is
an
art
très
difficile
très
compliqué
très
délicat
xlvii
it
is
presumptuous
for
us
to
play
mother
and
with
children
who
are
older
than
we
but
what
does
age
matter
every
one
needs
love
the
as
well
as
the
child
should
a
woman
only
exclusively
through
marriage
be
able
to
come
to
her
right
to
the
full
awakening
of
the
best
gifts
of
her
soul
because
the
highest
and
most
sacred
glory
of
woman
is
motherhood
but
then
must
a
woman
be
obliged
to
have
a
child
of
her
own
in
order
to
be
a
true
mother
a
being
who
is
all
love
and
sacrifice
if
that
is
true
how
pitifully
shallow
is
the
idea
of
the
world
that
it
is
only
a
piece
of
oneself
that
one
can
love
better
than
oneself
there
are
so
many
who
are
called
mothers
only
because
they
have
brought
children
into
the
world
but
beyond
that
they
are
not
worthy
of
the
name
a
woman
that
gives
all
the
love
that
is
in
her
heart
to
others
with
no
thought
of
herself
is
in
a
spiritual
we
set
the
spiritual
mother
higher
than
the
physical
we
hope
and
pray
fervently
that
later
if
it
is
granted
us
to
realize
our
ideals
and
we
stand
at
the
head
of
a
school
our
children
will
not
call
us
mother
as
a
matter
of
form
but
because
they
feel
that
we
are
mothers
we
hope
that
anneka
will
find
cordial
affectionate
people
at
buitenzorg
who
will
make
up
to
the
poor
lonely
child
for
the
lack
of
a
mother
and
of
a
home
of
her
own
anneka
lived
our
javanese
life
with
us
here
i
wish
that
you
could
have
taken
a
peep
at
the
little
corner
behind
the
door
where
anneka
sat
on
the
ground
with
us
in
such
a
sisterly
manner
one
evening
she
sat
by
us
in
our
chamber
at
the
low
table
where
i
am
now
writing
she
sewed
we
wrote
there
was
still
a
fourth
in
the
circle
a
friend
of
ours
she
read
aloud
or
rather
sang
to
us
you
know
of
course
that
all
of
our
books
are
written
in
poetic
metre
as
we
say
and
they
are
meant
to
be
sung
doors
and
windows
were
open
outside
the
chamber
there
bloomed
a
tjempaka
tree
its
perfume
came
to
us
on
the
soft
wind
the
voice
was
gentle
and
tender
the
song
was
sweet
to
our
listening
ears
it
carried
our
souls
back
to
the
far
distant
past
to
the
golden
age
of
barbaric
splendour
and
of
men
and
women
who
were
wise
and
beautiful
and
strong
we
bit
our
absently
much
oftener
than
we
made
them
fly
over
the
white
paper
and
amid
these
wholly
javanese
surroundings
there
between
brown
children
of
the
sunny
land
sat
a
pale
daughter
of
the
west
oh
how
gladly
would
we
have
you
even
so
among
us
we
have
learned
the
songs
too
and
if
we
were
not
bashful
we
would
sing
and
dream
before
you
yesterday
annie
did
something
typically
javanese
she
was
so
anxious
to
go
away
from
japara
we
said
to
her
ask
the
help
of
the
soenan
of
kantingan
promise
him
an
offering
of
flowers
if
your
wish
comes
true
so
she
did
day
before
yesterday
evening
we
spoke
of
it
and
the
next
morning
she
went
with
us
to
make
her
offering
we
went
there
with
a
band
of
priests
to
the
holy
grave
and
we
took
flowers
and
incense
with
us
anneka
went
with
us
into
the
building
over
the
grave
and
sat
with
us
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
tomb
incense
burned
and
a
mystic
buzzing
rose
at
first
softly
but
gradually
louder
from
the
priestly
choir
it
was
solemn
and
impressive
we
sat
with
lowered
heads
and
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
mystic
prayer
while
blue
clouds
of
incense
rose
upwards
one
of
the
priests
creeping
forward
on
the
ground
brought
flowers
and
laid
them
reverently
on
the
grave
of
the
soenan
and
after
that
on
the
other
graves
next
to
me
i
heard
a
snickering
it
was
anneka
barefooted
as
a
mark
of
reverence
she
had
come
with
us
into
the
building
for
it
is
our
custom
to
look
upon
the
dead
as
holy
and
to
show
them
reverence
we
then
went
to
the
little
stream
behind
the
churchyard
to
wash
our
feet
we
asked
the
priest
for
heaven
blessing
for
anneka
dearest
we
should
so
love
to
have
you
here
so
that
you
could
live
our
native
life
with
us
there
is
so
much
that
is
touching
in
our
javanese
life
especially
in
the
honour
that
we
show
to
our
dead
and
to
our
parents
nothing
ever
happens
in
our
lives
of
any
importance
either
of
joy
or
of
sorrow
that
we
do
not
think
of
our
dead
anneka
will
remember
japara
when
she
sits
high
and
dry
at
buitenzorg
although
she
may
be
a
thousand
times
better
off
there
than
here
they
that
have
known
japara
who
have
seen
its
soul
can
never
forget
it
they
must
think
of
it
again
and
again
whether
it
is
with
love
or
whether
it
is
with
hate
yesterday
at
midday
we
went
to
the
works
it
was
very
interesting
there
were
fifteen
people
men
and
apprentices
at
work
the
work
they
do
is
severely
simple
but
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
effective
sister
roekmini
must
naturally
go
to
work
with
them
and
she
sat
down
with
the
on
a
bench
as
naturally
as
though
she
had
been
there
all
along
we
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
frits
reuter
he
is
a
writer
who
draws
one
heart
he
is
so
wholesome
and
spontaneous
what
do
you
say
to
reading
one
book
through
from
seven
in
the
evening
to
three
in
the
morning
it
is
not
sensible
but
it
can
be
forgiven
when
one
is
in
good
company
if
it
was
your
intention
by
your
present
to
make
us
love
your
great
poet
of
the
people
then
you
should
certainly
be
satisfied
with
your
work
we
have
also
enjoyed
vosmaer
beautiful
inwijding
it
was
our
first
acquaintance
with
this
netherlander
and
we
thank
you
heartily
for
introducing
us
to
him
it
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
introductions
of
our
lives
after
reading
inwijding
we
received
a
book
on
greek
mythology
with
pictures
of
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
it
is
delightful
to
look
at
the
plates
and
read
the
descriptions
after
inwijding
oh
to
see
all
that
beauty
with
one
own
eyes
and
to
experience
the
emotion
that
thrilled
the
souls
of
sietska
and
frank
no
no
we
must
not
desire
so
much
we
are
only
thankful
that
there
is
some
one
endowed
with
the
power
of
words
who
has
made
it
live
and
breath
and
that
we
can
understand
his
language
to
mevrouw
abendanon
carel
vosmaer
poet
and
art
critic
author
of
amazone
and
the
translator
of
homer
into
dutch
hexameters
xlviii
i
feel
some
anxiety
as
to
who
will
carry
on
our
work
in
directing
the
wood
carving
after
we
have
gone
away
our
little
sisters
are
too
young
and
there
is
the
financial
responsibility
as
well
if
a
european
comes
here
naturally
our
artists
will
be
exploited
merely
for
his
own
profit
the
one
who
devotes
himself
to
this
work
should
be
disinterested
and
have
in
his
heart
a
love
for
art
and
a
love
for
java
the
world
says
that
everything
spontaneous
must
be
suppressed
and
everything
that
differs
from
it
is
necessarily
soiled
and
smirched
in
all
ages
the
way
of
the
idealist
has
been
hard
no
deviation
from
the
set
type
is
suffered
every
one
who
is
not
like
the
rest
of
the
world
is
tormented
all
his
life
unless
he
throws
away
his
own
coat
and
in
its
stead
draws
on
the
coat
of
custom
i
do
not
want
to
promise
you
anything
stella
for
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
be
able
to
keep
my
promise
do
you
think
modjowarno
so
frightful
which
would
you
prefer
that
we
should
go
crazy
here
at
home
or
that
we
seek
healing
for
the
wounds
in
our
souls
there
if
we
are
disappointed
in
our
plans
we
are
determined
that
we
will
not
remain
any
longer
cloistered
and
imprisoned
here
for
petty
futile
reasons
we
will
not
submit
to
conditions
which
we
detest
and
despise
with
all
our
hearts
the
enemy
abroad
does
not
frighten
us
but
the
enemy
in
our
own
country
eats
into
our
souls
nothing
can
help
us
but
god
now
do
not
say
that
you
will
be
cast
down
and
sad
when
you
receive
a
letter
telling
you
to
address
me
at
modjowarno
the
idea
has
no
terror
for
me
it
is
true
that
we
shall
go
there
with
lacerated
hearts
but
that
will
not
be
the
fault
of
modjowarno
and
even
there
all
will
not
be
lost
stella
you
have
often
encouraged
me
to
use
my
pen
i
shall
still
have
that
and
there
i
shall
have
nothing
to
lose
and
nothing
to
venture
save
myself
here
i
should
venture
much
if
i
said
what
i
really
think
if
i
became
a
teacher
i
should
be
striking
my
own
calling
dead
because
those
whom
i
had
offended
would
gird
on
their
armour
and
hunt
me
down
i
have
already
said
that
we
would
not
go
to
modjowarno
save
with
deeply
wounded
souls
do
you
know
the
effect
that
would
have
upon
my
pen
nothing
speaks
so
to
the
heart
like
suffering
and
even
i
have
made
eyes
grow
wet
you
know
me
too
well
i
hope
to
accuse
me
of
vanity
when
i
say
that
it
is
only
to
show
you
how
very
much
the
worth
of
a
pen
rises
when
one
has
heart
blood
for
ink
a
few
months
ago
some
one
wholly
unknown
to
me
burst
out
crying
when
she
read
some
words
of
mine
she
felt
how
i
had
suffered
when
the
words
flowed
from
my
pen
she
was
so
affected
that
she
wished
to
begin
work
at
once
for
the
alleviation
of
the
misery
of
which
i
had
written
the
next
day
she
even
offered
to
help
us
alas
only
to
withdraw
the
offer
a
few
days
later
through
the
working
of
reason
people
think
that
they
are
pleasing
me
when
they
assure
me
that
i
write
splendidly
what
does
it
amount
to
i
want
what
i
write
to
make
a
lasting
impression
stella
and
i
can
only
do
that
when
i
have
had
experience
when
my
heart
has
been
written
upon
then
only
then
will
what
i
say
be
of
worth
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
xlix
during
the
last
year
i
often
heard
something
about
myself
which
distresses
me
i
am
a
coquette
do
not
spare
me
but
answer
outright
am
i
a
coquette
and
if
so
in
what
way
i
am
seriously
troubled
for
i
dislike
anything
that
is
inconstant
some
one
no
slanderer
says
that
i
speak
with
my
eyes
is
that
true
i
have
asked
my
sister
to
watch
me
well
and
to
tell
me
what
they
see
in
me
that
is
strange
what
there
is
in
the
play
of
my
eyes
and
my
little
sister
says
she
is
always
conscientious
that
my
eyes
dance
as
if
they
were
saying
much
when
i
talk
long
never
mind
with
whom
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
do
it
intentionally
that
i
have
no
thought
of
pleasing
and
if
what
she
says
is
true
it
is
unconscious
and
in
spite
of
myself
it
is
a
strange
sensation
when
one
has
always
thought
oneself
a
serious
candid
girl
to
hear
all
at
once
that
one
is
a
coquettish
creature
i
was
astonished
and
distressed
i
had
never
given
the
matter
a
thought
and
would
not
be
guilty
of
such
conduct
knowingly
i
am
told
that
i
must
modestly
hypocritically
cast
down
my
eyes
i
will
not
do
that
i
will
look
men
as
well
as
women
straight
in
the
eyes
not
cast
down
my
own
before
them
i
know
very
well
that
we
shall
be
made
to
promise
perhaps
under
oath
when
we
go
from
here
that
we
will
not
bring
to
our
families
the
terrible
disgrace
of
sharing
our
love
and
sorrow
with
a
european
on
that
point
they
can
be
at
peace
we
would
never
think
of
such
a
thing
inevitably
it
would
be
wreaking
destruction
upon
the
whole
cause
for
our
own
sakes
we
could
not
we
who
wish
to
set
ourselves
up
as
examples
you
know
how
very
little
i
care
for
what
they
say
but
in
this
case
it
shall
never
be
said
there
you
have
the
whole
thing
see
what
comes
of
it
when
a
man
gives
his
daughters
european
educations
they
marry
europeans
that
would
do
incalculable
injury
to
the
cause
and
that
may
not
be
and
yet
actually
what
do
we
do
but
share
our
love
and
sorrow
with
europeans
what
am
i
doing
at
this
moment
do
not
europeans
live
with
us
in
our
inmost
hearts
and
do
we
not
share
the
inner
life
of
europeans
much
yes
everything
can
be
taken
away
from
me
but
not
my
pen
that
will
always
be
mine
do
not
let
them
provoke
us
too
much
the
most
enduring
patience
can
give
way
we
may
be
driven
to
the
use
of
that
weapon
even
though
it
should
rebound
and
wound
ourselves
you
may
be
assured
that
we
will
make
good
use
of
it
if
we
go
to
modjowarno
we
long
for
comfort
from
our
true
friends
we
have
grown
cold
we
want
to
warm
our
frozen
hearts
on
your
hearts
we
complain
about
the
egoism
of
others
but
what
of
ourselves
it
is
pure
egotism
to
share
our
pain
and
suffering
with
others
and
to
ask
for
love
when
we
know
that
for
us
love
is
inseparable
from
sorrow
do
you
not
think
we
have
gone
back
sadly
we
have
grown
hard
and
unfeeling
and
we
are
often
afraid
of
ourselves
o
god
give
us
strength
help
and
support
us
and
from
you
dear
i
ask
forgiveness
for
the
sorrow
i
have
caused
you
by
this
letter
but
to
be
silent
is
not
good
it
is
not
honest
forgive
me
and
love
your
brown
children
to
mevrouw
abendanon
l
in
spite
of
all
that
we
have
suffered
we
know
that
we
are
fortunate
for
there
are
many
poor
creatures
in
even
more
miserable
circumstances
than
ourselves
who
without
friends
without
a
single
confidante
must
struggle
on
alone
through
life
never
hearing
a
cordial
sympathetic
word
never
meeting
an
understanding
look
or
receiving
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
we
feel
that
we
are
richly
blessed
in
the
possession
of
love
and
friendship
such
as
yours
if
you
will
always
love
and
trust
us
little
mother
you
will
make
us
happy
we
thank
you
again
and
again
for
your
love
and
sympathy
you
see
we
are
answering
your
letter
at
once
and
we
shall
put
it
away
and
keep
it
as
a
sacred
relic
we
pray
and
entreat
you
think
no
more
about
our
happiness
we
have
told
you
so
often
that
it
is
not
our
own
happiness
we
seek
but
that
of
others
when
we
go
to
europe
we
do
not
expect
to
gather
roses
for
ourselves
i
protest
we
expect
nothing
of
europe
nothing
of
the
happiness
of
which
european
girls
dream
nor
do
we
expect
that
we
will
find
much
friendship
and
sympathy
there
or
that
we
will
feel
at
home
in
a
strange
environment
we
hope
only
for
one
thing
to
find
there
knowledge
and
enlightenment
it
will
not
matter
if
we
do
not
find
it
gay
in
europe
if
we
but
receive
there
what
we
seek
we
do
not
expect
the
european
world
to
make
us
happier
the
time
has
long
gone
by
when
we
seriously
believed
that
the
european
is
the
only
true
civilization
supreme
and
unsurpassed
forgive
us
if
we
say
it
but
do
you
yourself
think
the
civilization
of
europe
perfect
we
should
be
the
last
not
to
see
and
appreciate
the
great
good
that
is
in
your
world
but
will
you
not
acknowledge
that
there
is
also
much
that
brings
the
very
name
of
civilization
into
ridicule
we
complain
about
pettiness
and
smallness
of
soul
in
our
own
surroundings
do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
we
think
that
in
holland
we
shall
not
find
pettiness
too
you
know
better
than
we
that
among
the
thousands
that
are
called
civilized
by
the
world
only
a
very
few
are
that
in
reality
that
a
broad
mind
is
not
possessed
by
every
european
from
whom
it
might
be
expected
and
even
in
the
most
elegant
exclusive
and
brilliant
salons
prejudice
intolerance
and
short
sightedness
are
no
infrequent
visitors
we
do
not
think
of
holland
as
an
ideal
country
not
in
the
least
judging
from
what
we
have
seen
of
the
hollanders
here
we
can
certainly
reckon
upon
much
in
that
small
cold
country
that
will
wound
our
sensibilities
and
bitterly
grieve
us
we
javanese
are
reproached
as
born
liars
wholly
untrustworthy
and
we
are
called
ingratitude
personified
we
have
not
only
read
this
many
times
but
we
have
heard
it
spoken
aloud
and
that
was
a
fair
test
of
the
speaker
delicacy
of
feeling
we
only
smile
when
we
read
or
hear
such
pleasantries
we
think
to
ourselves
of
european
society
life
which
often
gives
glaring
proof
of
the
truth
and
sincerity
of
those
who
sit
in
high
places
and
look
down
with
scorn
upon
the
lying
untrustworthy
javanese
we
came
in
contact
with
europeans
very
little
until
a
few
years
ago
the
first
occasion
on
which
we
found
ourselves
in
a
european
crowd
was
at
the
time
of
the
coronation
of
her
majesty
how
admirable
was
the
comedy
play
of
the
european
world
behind
the
scenes
at
that
festival
my
reverence
for
europeans
received
its
death
blow
we
saw
two
ladies
in
earnest
speech
intimately
holding
one
another
by
the
arm
their
heads
confidentially
close
we
heard
affectionate
words
here
and
there
good
friends
thought
we
a
gentleman
came
and
broke
up
the
as
he
walked
away
with
one
of
the
ladies
we
heard
her
say
such
a
cat
while
the
remaining
lady
said
to
another
nearby
that
unfortunate
creature
she
rigs
herself
up
so
ridiculously
just
a
little
while
before
she
had
declared
that
the
dear
one
was
charmingly
dressed
we
received
blow
after
blow
that
evening
through
this
and
other
little
scenes
we
saw
red
fiery
men
faces
gentlemen
who
spread
the
horrible
breath
of
alcohol
around
them
when
they
spoke
and
oh
the
noise
and
racket
everywhere
we
grew
cold
to
our
very
hearts
and
longed
eagerly
to
get
away
from
these
civilized
surroundings
if
we
had
been
base
and
had
told
what
these
friends
had
said
of
one
another
a
formal
civil
war
would
have
broken
out
soon
after
that
a
girl
wrote
us
of
a
visit
which
she
had
paid
to
an
alleged
friend
she
had
been
so
charmingly
so
cordially
received
a
little
after
we
met
this
friend
and
thanked
her
for
her
kind
reception
of
our
little
friend
she
said
i
think
her
a
sullen
girl
she
always
looks
so
sour
and
waspish
innumerable
times
we
have
witnessed
fantastic
kisses
between
persons
whom
we
knew
hated
one
another
and
it
was
not
the
despised
nonas
who
did
this
but
white
people
of
unmixed
blood
educated
and
brought
up
with
every
advantage
we
saw
too
how
harmless
simple
nonas
were
held
up
to
ridicule
by
clever
educated
hollanders
the
javanese
is
a
born
liar
wholly
untrustworthy
we
leave
the
accusation
there
we
only
ask
that
when
a
child
sins
through
ignorance
and
a
full
grown
thinking
person
commits
the
same
sin
deliberately
and
with
calculation
which
of
the
two
is
the
most
guilty
we
think
sometimes
with
reason
what
is
civilization
does
it
consist
in
a
commanding
tone
or
in
hypocrisy
oh
what
do
we
do
what
have
we
said
forgive
us
little
mother
you
know
that
it
is
not
our
intention
to
grieve
you
by
being
honest
is
it
not
true
that
honesty
is
the
basis
of
our
friendship
of
our
love
often
it
is
not
polite
to
be
honest
we
do
not
enjoy
being
impolite
we
are
javanese
to
whom
politeness
belongs
as
a
natural
heritage
we
think
that
you
ought
to
know
our
opinion
of
some
things
in
your
civilization
because
you
seem
to
think
that
we
look
upon
the
european
world
as
our
ideal
it
is
not
always
there
that
we
have
found
true
education
and
we
know
that
you
must
think
the
same
thing
true
education
is
not
the
exclusive
property
of
those
who
have
had
the
advantage
of
books
it
is
to
be
found
as
well
among
the
people
upon
whom
a
majority
of
the
white
race
convinced
as
it
is
of
its
own
excellence
looks
down
with
disdain
our
people
have
faults
certainly
but
they
also
have
virtues
which
could
very
well
serve
as
examples
to
the
civilized
nations
we
have
degenerated
gone
backward
you
see
or
we
would
not
have
lost
what
a
superficial
glance
can
recognize
as
one
of
the
peculiar
qualities
of
the
javanese
people
modesty
father
said
to
me
once
ni
do
not
imagine
that
there
are
many
europeans
that
really
love
you
father
did
not
have
to
tell
me
that
i
knew
it
very
well
myself
we
could
count
upon
our
fingers
and
we
would
not
have
to
use
two
hands
either
those
who
are
really
our
sincere
friends
most
of
them
pretend
sympathy
for
effect
or
through
calculation
with
some
end
in
view
it
is
amusing
if
one
looks
at
the
humorous
side
of
such
things
then
one
is
not
distressed
people
often
do
such
foolish
things
do
not
imagine
that
i
do
not
see
that
many
of
those
who
now
talk
about
native
art
only
do
it
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
me
and
not
because
they
have
any
real
appreciation
of
it
before
me
every
one
is
enthusiastic
is
it
from
conviction
but
that
does
not
matter
the
result
will
be
good
and
through
such
people
the
real
friends
of
java
and
the
javanese
may
be
reached
we
know
why
the
is
glad
to
publish
our
articles
it
is
because
we
are
a
novelty
and
make
a
fine
advertisement
for
that
paper
the
dutch
lelie
placed
its
columns
at
my
disposal
and
time
and
again
the
directress
has
asked
for
letters
from
me
why
for
the
advertisement
letters
from
a
true
daughter
of
the
orient
from
a
real
javanese
girl
thoughts
from
such
a
creature
written
by
herself
in
a
european
language
how
interesting
if
in
despair
we
cry
aloud
our
miseries
in
the
dutch
language
again
it
is
so
very
interesting
and
if
which
may
god
forbid
some
day
we
should
die
of
our
broken
hearts
then
it
would
all
be
so
terribly
interesting
oh
there
are
people
who
think
that
only
the
interesting
is
desirable
there
is
much
that
is
beautiful
in
the
javanese
religious
law
it
is
only
a
pity
that
it
is
not
taken
more
as
a
symbol
people
take
the
things
that
the
wise
men
preach
literally
they
abstain
from
food
and
sleep
as
now
interpreted
it
means
that
one
must
eat
and
sleep
as
little
as
possible
and
all
will
be
well
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
hereafter
the
great
idea
that
is
back
of
it
they
pass
by
that
is
it
is
not
eating
and
sleeping
that
is
the
aim
of
life
i
am
a
child
of
buddha
and
it
is
taught
that
we
should
eat
no
animal
food
when
i
was
a
child
i
was
very
ill
the
doctors
could
not
help
me
they
could
suggest
nothing
then
a
chinese
convict
who
had
been
friendly
with
us
children
begged
to
be
allowed
to
help
me
my
parents
consented
and
i
was
healed
what
the
medicines
of
learned
men
could
not
accomplish
was
done
by
quackery
he
healed
me
simply
by
giving
me
ashes
to
drink
of
the
dedicated
to
a
chinese
idol
through
drinking
that
potion
i
became
the
child
of
that
chinese
divinity
of
welahan
a
year
or
so
ago
we
made
a
visit
to
the
holy
one
there
is
a
little
golden
image
before
which
incense
is
burned
day
and
night
in
times
of
epidemic
it
is
carried
around
in
state
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirits
the
birthday
of
the
holy
one
is
celebrated
with
great
brilliancy
and
chinese
come
from
far
and
near
old
chinese
residents
have
told
us
the
legend
of
the
golden
image
which
for
them
really
lives
our
land
is
full
of
mysticism
of
fairy
tales
and
of
legends
you
have
certainly
heard
many
times
of
the
enviable
calmness
with
which
the
javanese
meets
the
most
frightful
blows
of
destiny
it
is
tekdir
foreordained
they
say
and
are
submissive
the
fate
of
every
man
is
determined
even
before
he
sees
the
light
of
life
happiness
and
misery
are
meted
out
to
him
before
his
birth
no
man
may
turn
away
that
which
god
has
decreed
but
it
is
the
duty
of
every
one
to
guard
against
misfortune
as
far
as
possible
only
when
it
comes
despite
their
efforts
is
it
tekdir
and
against
tekdir
nothing
in
the
world
can
prevail
that
tells
us
to
be
steadfast
and
to
push
forward
and
to
let
happen
what
happen
will
to
submit
calmly
to
the
inevitable
and
then
to
say
it
is
tekdir
that
is
why
our
people
would
not
set
themselves
for
ever
against
that
which
had
actually
happened
brought
face
to
face
with
a
fact
they
are
face
to
face
with
tekdir
and
are
submissive
god
give
us
strength
we
are
in
deep
sorrow
we
are
preparing
to
go
away
from
our
loved
ones
to
break
loose
the
bonds
which
until
now
have
been
our
happiness
but
better
a
sound
little
hut
than
a
castle
in
ruins
better
a
strong
little
skiff
than
to
go
in
a
splendid
and
be
driven
upon
a
reef
for
a
long
time
now
i
have
had
to
go
to
bed
without
father
greeting
until
a
few
months
ago
father
never
went
to
bed
without
stopping
first
outside
our
chamber
door
and
putting
his
head
inside
to
see
his
little
daughter
once
more
and
to
call
her
name
before
he
went
to
rest
if
the
door
was
locked
he
knocked
softly
his
little
daughter
must
hear
and
know
that
she
was
not
forgotten
gone
now
is
that
dear
dear
time
i
have
had
much
love
too
much
all
to
myself
for
when
one
has
had
too
much
then
there
must
be
another
who
goes
lacking
now
it
is
my
turn
to
do
without
i
have
bathed
long
enough
in
the
it
is
hard
for
me
but
for
him
my
father
i
hope
and
pray
fervently
that
he
may
be
so
fortunate
as
to
banish
me
from
his
heart
utterly
my
poor
dear
loved
one
will
then
be
spared
much
misery
i
shall
always
love
him
dearly
in
spite
of
everything
he
is
more
to
me
than
ever
and
i
am
thankful
for
all
the
happy
years
that
have
gone
by
but
for
my
poor
father
it
would
be
better
had
i
never
become
a
child
of
buddha
he
would
then
possess
me
wholly
even
though
it
were
only
in
memory
what
nellie
said
is
true
life
brings
more
cruel
partings
than
death
those
whom
death
takes
away
from
us
in
the
bloom
of
love
and
friendship
remain
more
surely
ours
in
spirit
than
those
whom
life
leaves
to
us
my
dearest
father
that
he
should
find
this
out
in
his
old
age
and
from
his
favourite
child
may
god
forgive
me
but
it
is
not
he
alone
who
has
suffered
and
who
will
suffer
we
too
have
striven
and
suffered
we
pray
god
fervently
that
in
the
course
of
time
he
may
see
the
truth
and
will
learn
to
be
proud
of
his
little
daughters
that
we
may
atone
to
him
in
some
measure
for
the
deep
disappointment
we
are
causing
him
now
to
mevrouw
abendanon
a
woman
child
of
a
native
mother
and
european
father
formerly
in
java
convicts
were
released
from
prison
to
work
the
government
lands
li
when
we
love
is
it
not
our
earnest
wish
that
the
object
of
our
love
should
be
happy
and
those
are
happy
who
love
and
are
loved
in
return
i
am
not
speaking
here
of
the
love
of
man
and
woman
that
is
a
delicate
question
and
one
that
i
am
not
capable
of
judging
but
i
mean
a
love
which
one
can
feel
for
many
and
never
mind
how
much
for
one
for
another
in
just
the
same
measure
is
it
selfish
when
we
expect
those
whom
we
love
and
who
love
us
in
return
to
rejoice
in
our
happiness
even
when
it
consists
in
the
giving
of
our
hearts
to
another
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lii
three
of
the
four
shelves
of
our
are
plump
full
of
books
the
fourth
we
keep
free
for
photographs
and
other
souvenirs
so
that
we
have
all
of
our
friends
before
us
you
are
between
mamma
and
brother
kartono
a
little
further
away
is
adriana
the
learned
man
who
is
such
a
friend
of
humanity
then
comes
a
charming
little
creature
a
pure
fresh
unspoiled
flower
of
nature
whom
we
love
very
much
papa
too
has
a
place
of
honour
you
are
in
good
company
truly
and
we
have
you
with
us
every
day
in
fact
the
day
has
not
begun
for
us
until
we
have
seen
our
friends
and
looked
into
their
dear
true
faces
we
have
an
idea
that
we
shall
see
you
just
once
and
that
the
meeting
will
be
brief
a
meeting
a
brief
greeting
and
then
a
parting
all
in
a
few
moments
of
time
we
shall
catch
as
it
were
a
glimpse
of
one
another
and
then
vanish
for
ever
each
from
the
other
ken
it
is
silly
but
we
have
this
idea
and
are
not
able
to
get
it
out
of
our
heads
but
why
do
we
yearn
for
the
personal
bodily
meeting
when
the
spiritual
meeting
is
so
pleasant
we
ought
not
to
need
anything
more
is
not
the
spiritual
the
best
in
us
what
do
you
think
of
the
japaraesque
it
is
splendid
is
it
not
hail
to
all
noble
friends
of
java
who
brought
the
art
of
her
people
and
with
it
the
beauty
of
their
souls
into
the
light
we
hope
fervently
that
the
interest
now
taken
will
not
dwindle
as
has
that
in
all
too
many
other
things
and
that
it
will
not
prove
only
a
fleeting
fashion
no
it
shall
not
do
that
although
we
realize
that
the
majority
of
those
who
now
show
interest
in
our
art
do
so
only
because
it
is
the
fashion
but
those
who
gave
the
movement
its
first
impetus
did
so
from
sincere
conviction
and
that
will
prevail
in
the
long
run
you
see
i
should
enjoy
living
so
many
different
kinds
of
lives
i
should
like
to
be
in
a
mining
district
among
mine
workers
or
in
a
native
christian
community
among
native
christians
in
a
chinese
or
malay
camp
or
what
not
but
above
all
i
should
like
to
experience
life
as
it
is
lived
in
dessa
and
kampong
among
our
own
people
that
has
always
had
a
great
charm
for
me
i
know
that
my
people
would
then
grow
still
nearer
to
my
heart
one
can
not
learn
the
soul
of
a
people
without
living
and
working
among
them
the
love
that
i
have
for
our
people
is
only
a
foretaste
of
what
i
should
feel
under
more
intimate
circumstances
we
try
to
come
in
contact
with
the
people
as
much
as
possible
when
we
go
out
alone
we
always
stop
and
pay
a
visit
to
some
of
the
kampong
houses
in
the
beginning
they
looked
at
us
with
strange
unfriendly
eyes
but
it
is
not
so
any
longer
a
child
hand
is
quickly
filled
so
too
is
the
hand
of
a
childlike
people
they
are
very
sensitive
to
kindness
and
also
have
a
quick
sense
of
humour
under
the
influence
of
a
ready
word
which
will
bring
a
hearty
laugh
a
sullen
karwei
is
changed
into
a
cheerful
human
being
every
day
for
some
months
we
have
had
a
gang
of
workmen
from
the
on
our
place
they
are
busy
building
an
addition
to
our
house
we
are
going
to
have
a
splendid
pendopo
at
our
rear
during
the
rest
hour
we
often
go
and
talk
a
little
with
the
picture
your
sister
sitting
on
a
heap
of
sand
surrounded
by
workmen
who
have
almost
no
clothes
on
their
bodies
and
who
are
smoking
straw
or
eating
rice
naturally
we
must
begin
the
conversation
for
an
inferior
would
rather
be
silent
a
whole
day
than
to
speak
first
to
his
superior
they
work
under
the
supervision
of
an
indo
he
is
good
to
his
people
who
come
and
go
freely
in
his
presence
and
are
always
treated
with
consideration
we
often
hear
them
make
little
pleasantries
with
the
toewan
a
certain
indication
that
the
baas
is
good
to
them
if
they
receive
orders
to
work
we
never
hear
them
grumble
that
is
pleasant
is
it
not
and
this
sinjo
might
well
serve
as
an
example
to
heer
abendanon
used
commonly
to
denote
a
blood
sinjo
from
the
portuguese
senhor
indicating
master
used
toward
natives
with
european
blood
liii
we
think
that
your
little
table
is
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
carved
work
that
our
singo
has
done
a
short
while
ago
he
was
saved
as
though
by
a
miracle
from
a
great
calamity
eleven
houses
near
his
own
were
burned
to
the
ground
the
cocoanut
tree
in
his
little
garden
was
all
ablaze
but
by
great
good
fortune
his
house
remained
uninjured
the
whole
village
ran
out
to
see
the
miracle
and
asked
the
lucky
owner
of
the
only
remaining
house
what
ilmoe
or
djamat
he
had
to
protect
him
for
they
thought
of
course
that
he
had
saved
his
house
through
some
magic
spell
no
he
had
no
ilmoe
or
djamat
nor
magic
spells
he
had
only
goesti
allah
who
had
spared
him
for
his
own
purposes
the
day
after
the
fire
the
man
came
to
us
and
fancy
he
thanked
us
for
the
preservation
of
his
dwelling
he
insisted
that
it
was
the
power
of
our
prayers
for
him
that
had
kept
his
house
from
misfortune
such
naïve
and
simple
faith
is
touching
i
asked
myself
if
it
would
be
right
to
take
away
from
these
poor
souls
the
simple
faith
that
makes
them
happy
what
could
i
give
them
in
its
stead
the
stupidest
person
can
tear
down
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
to
build
up
we
have
found
so
many
charming
qualities
in
our
humble
friends
we
were
turned
away
for
a
long
time
from
all
religion
because
we
saw
so
much
uncharitableness
under
its
mantle
we
learned
at
first
slowly
that
it
is
not
religion
that
is
uncharitable
but
man
who
has
made
what
was
originally
godlike
and
beautiful
bad
and
ugly
we
think
that
love
is
the
highest
religion
and
must
one
be
a
christian
in
order
to
love
according
to
that
heavenly
command
for
the
buddhist
the
brahmin
the
jew
the
mohammedan
and
even
the
heathen
can
lead
lives
of
pure
love
a
little
while
ago
i
received
a
letter
from
adriani
in
which
you
would
be
interested
i
told
him
what
you
had
done
for
us
and
he
is
so
glad
for
our
sakes
what
mevrouw
van
kol
has
made
you
see
he
wrote
is
the
substance
of
all
religion
the
recognition
of
god
as
a
person
not
as
goodness
but
the
good
there
are
many
earnest
things
in
his
letter
i
wish
that
i
could
read
it
to
you
and
talk
about
it
with
you
i
must
answer
it
somewhere
he
says
but
i
can
see
no
other
way
christianity
alone
does
not
bring
one
happiness
only
the
personal
love
of
god
does
that
of
which
christianity
is
the
symbol
to
mevrouw
abendanon
magic
power
to
obtain
what
one
wishes
a
talisman
which
protects
from
calamity
liv
my
brother
my
little
brother
will
positively
not
become
priaja
and
enter
the
service
of
the
indian
government
if
mevrouw
has
told
you
something
of
my
letters
you
will
know
that
i
am
not
sorry
but
am
rejoicing
with
brother
in
his
decision
we
think
it
splendid
that
brother
has
not
for
an
ideal
that
which
thousands
of
his
fellow
countrymen
have
always
looked
upon
as
most
desirable
as
the
very
height
of
good
fortune
to
be
a
little
prince
glittering
with
buttons
under
a
gold
striped
parasol
it
is
a
great
joy
to
us
that
pomp
and
ceremony
have
no
charm
for
him
and
that
he
has
realized
so
young
that
he
wishes
to
go
another
way
from
the
one
that
has
always
been
followed
and
trodden
flat
by
the
feet
of
thousands
i
should
have
liked
for
him
to
dedicate
himself
to
the
service
of
suffering
humanity
and
to
have
studied
medicine
that
is
perhaps
part
selfishness
in
me
i
should
have
been
glad
to
see
him
become
a
doctor
because
it
is
such
a
beautiful
calling
and
it
would
have
inevitably
taught
him
to
understand
our
ideals
he
could
have
done
so
much
to
further
the
mutual
respect
between
the
european
and
native
elements
he
could
have
taught
his
people
to
trust
the
european
methods
of
healing
and
he
could
have
called
the
attention
of
the
european
world
to
the
simple
native
methods
whose
value
has
been
many
times
proven
i
spoke
to
little
brother
about
the
school
but
he
had
no
inclination
in
that
direction
and
we
do
not
wish
to
press
him
to
abendanon
lv
for
three
longs
weeks
not
a
drop
of
rain
has
fallen
it
is
boiling
hot
as
it
has
never
been
before
even
in
the
dryest
oostmoesson
father
is
in
despair
the
young
rice
in
the
fields
is
turning
brown
oh
our
poor
people
so
far
they
have
had
enough
to
eat
here
and
they
do
not
know
the
most
frightful
of
all
calamities
which
a
land
can
suffer
famine
but
what
has
not
been
may
be
and
this
great
drought
in
the
time
of
the
wet
season
presages
anything
but
good
what
will
happen
if
it
keeps
up
for
several
mornings
the
wind
has
blown
as
it
usually
does
first
in
may
has
the
turning
point
been
reached
has
the
dry
season
begun
it
is
frightful
every
one
looks
on
helpless
it
is
hard
to
see
everything
that
has
been
sown
and
planted
turn
brown
and
die
without
being
able
to
turn
a
finger
to
help
it
and
the
great
heat
harasses
the
body
too
one
feels
dull
and
listless
what
do
you
think
of
such
a
complaint
from
a
child
of
the
sun
oh
how
frightful
for
the
people
who
are
working
out
in
the
fields
if
for
us
in
here
it
is
so
scalding
hot
and
this
is
the
wet
season
westmoesson
do
not
be
chary
with
your
cold
could
you
not
spare
a
little
of
it
you
may
take
as
much
of
our
warmth
as
you
wish
to
mevrouw
van
kol
lvi
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
time
that
is
past
the
old
time
when
i
sat
with
your
father
and
your
dear
mother
by
the
sea
those
were
moments
of
delight
such
as
one
never
forgets
the
last
time
too
that
we
sat
with
your
father
by
the
shore
and
he
talked
to
us
of
our
plans
will
always
live
in
our
memory
it
was
splendid
to
speak
heart
to
heart
with
one
whom
we
knew
to
be
such
a
noble
sincere
friend
and
what
was
the
result
i
could
not
sleep
the
whole
night
i
tossed
about
in
my
bed
with
your
father
earnest
affectionate
words
still
in
my
mind
and
in
my
heart
that
was
what
we
had
needed
what
we
had
longed
for
an
earnest
affectionate
word
spoken
face
to
face
the
next
morning
early
your
father
had
to
go
away
to
our
great
sorrow
we
went
with
his
excellency
in
the
carriage
past
the
way
where
we
had
talked
on
the
sand
the
result
of
that
talk
is
that
very
soon
with
the
full
consent
of
our
parents
we
are
going
to
present
a
petition
to
the
government
through
the
governor
general
asking
it
to
give
us
an
opportunity
to
help
the
javanese
woman
of
the
future
by
completing
our
education
at
batavia
are
you
not
startled
brother
i
do
not
know
what
you
will
think
that
we
are
fickle
to
strive
with
all
our
might
at
first
to
go
to
holland
move
heaven
and
earth
to
get
there
and
when
at
last
thanks
to
the
work
of
our
friends
we
can
go
to
say
i
am
going
to
stay
what
do
you
think
of
such
instability
but
is
it
not
better
to
turn
back
and
acknowledge
one
mistake
than
to
persist
in
a
wrong
course
for
the
sake
of
consistency
do
you
know
when
that
idea
of
going
to
holland
first
took
such
a
fast
hold
of
us
it
was
in
the
december
days
of
when
we
suffered
without
knowing
why
then
there
came
to
us
a
wild
longing
to
go
away
far
away
away
away
away
into
another
atmosphere
to
another
land
where
we
should
breathe
a
different
air
and
all
our
soul
wounds
should
be
healed
where
we
should
be
strengthened
in
spirit
and
perhaps
also
in
body
strengthened
and
born
anew
we
would
come
back
to
work
for
the
regeneration
of
our
people
while
we
were
away
people
would
cease
to
think
of
us
alas
that
it
would
seem
so
good
to
be
forgotten
we
should
be
forgotten
by
those
for
whom
we
would
work
whom
we
so
longed
to
help
o
poor
illusions
you
know
that
it
has
always
been
one
of
our
dearest
dreams
to
be
educated
for
our
work
in
holland
but
father
last
severe
illness
has
made
us
think
deeply
we
understood
at
last
as
we
stood
over
his
sick
bed
how
fast
his
dear
heart
was
bound
up
in
us
but
i
still
ask
myself
should
we
have
come
to
this
decision
if
your
father
had
not
been
here
and
talked
with
us
i
do
not
know
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
parents
have
to
thank
your
father
for
much
and
we
ourselves
are
very
grateful
to
his
excellency
too
sister
and
i
have
talked
and
pondered
over
your
father
words
for
a
long
time
the
result
is
that
our
going
to
holland
is
still
in
the
air
has
flown
to
the
moon
but
that
we
hope
to
go
to
batavia
with
all
speed
this
is
all
personal
more
important
is
the
effect
which
our
decision
will
have
upon
our
cause
in
the
first
place
if
we
go
to
batavia
we
could
begin
to
study
at
once
while
if
we
go
to
holland
we
must
wait
a
long
time
i
think
always
of
your
father
words
why
not
do
what
can
be
done
at
once
something
will
have
been
accomplished
then
while
in
holland
everything
would
lie
far
in
the
future
your
father
spoke
of
the
wounded
man
who
called
for
help
some
one
comes
to
him
and
says
no
friend
i
can
not
help
you
now
i
must
first
study
and
learn
how
wounds
should
be
dressed
then
the
some
one
goes
away
and
when
at
last
he
had
learned
the
art
of
binding
wounds
the
man
who
had
called
to
him
had
long
been
dead
then
your
father
spoke
of
a
pearl
lying
deep
in
the
sea
you
know
that
it
is
there
but
you
do
not
know
precisely
where
you
wade
out
into
the
sea
and
try
to
find
it
the
water
comes
up
to
your
lips
some
one
calls
to
you
and
friend
do
not
do
that
go
no
further
the
water
already
comes
up
to
your
lips
if
you
are
drowned
still
you
will
not
have
the
pearl
get
into
a
boat
measure
and
fish
for
it
your
father
said
we
could
open
a
school
at
once
without
having
to
pass
a
single
examination
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
compels
one
to
pass
examination
before
teaching
native
girls
we
could
get
some
european
teachers
to
help
us
that
would
be
as
we
wished
but
do
you
think
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
open
it
at
all
without
adequate
preparation
it
is
true
that
in
our
school
how
pleasant
that
sounds
we
want
to
give
more
of
a
moral
than
an
academic
education
if
it
is
not
erected
by
the
government
we
would
not
have
to
follow
the
prescribed
paths
and
we
want
the
whole
idea
of
our
school
to
be
the
education
of
children
not
as
though
they
were
in
a
school
but
in
a
home
as
a
mother
would
bring
up
her
own
children
it
must
be
like
a
great
home
community
where
the
inmates
all
love
one
another
and
learn
from
one
another
and
where
the
mother
is
not
a
mother
in
name
but
in
spirit
the
educator
of
the
child
soul
and
body
we
have
thought
much
about
that
other
idea
of
your
father
but
in
this
way
if
we
are
not
able
to
study
but
have
to
remain
at
home
could
we
not
take
the
little
daughters
of
regents
here
as
many
as
the
kaboepaten
would
hold
let
them
go
to
school
outside
but
give
them
their
moral
education
here
with
us
we
could
lead
the
young
hearts
through
play
and
help
to
form
the
young
characters
during
the
hours
when
those
children
would
be
at
school
we
could
take
other
little
children
of
native
chiefs
here
in
our
own
neighbourhood
and
teach
them
elementary
branches
handiwork
and
other
things
all
the
while
unperceived
we
would
be
knocking
at
the
little
hearts
and
trying
to
get
nearer
to
the
little
souls
but
if
we
find
that
we
can
open
a
school
then
we
had
rather
study
first
do
you
not
think
we
are
right
brother
the
school
would
be
at
magelang
or
at
salatiga
your
father
has
talked
with
ours
about
it
and
there
is
no
objection
at
all
that
would
be
almost
as
good
as
going
to
holland
it
would
be
splendid
hé
brother
our
grandfather
in
the
past
brought
up
the
sons
of
other
nobles
grandfather
had
a
tutor
for
his
children
and
he
took
the
sons
of
the
pangerang
of
solo
and
of
a
regent
of
middle
java
to
be
educated
with
his
own
sons
so
you
see
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
our
idea
which
is
called
startlingly
new
is
old
inherited
from
our
grandfather
our
plan
of
education
our
spirit
has
descended
from
him
grandfather
was
a
pioneer
we
are
only
carrying
on
his
work
they
were
good
people
both
grandfather
and
grandmother
your
father
has
told
us
that
according
to
form
a
note
must
be
presented
in
which
our
plans
and
ideas
are
set
forth
plainly
and
exactly
it
must
be
written
from
the
heart
not
at
all
as
though
it
was
intended
for
the
governor
general
we
should
like
for
your
father
to
read
the
note
first
but
his
excellency
does
not
think
it
necessary
we
must
write
simply
just
as
we
feel
to
heer
abendanon
lvii
i
must
thank
you
once
more
for
your
advice
your
talk
did
us
a
tremendous
amount
of
good
why
should
i
not
acknowledge
to
you
that
we
had
never
looked
at
things
in
that
light
before
and
had
never
dreamed
that
if
we
went
to
holland
we
might
endanger
our
own
cause
our
friends
would
be
only
too
glad
to
spread
abroad
the
report
that
we
had
grown
to
be
wholly
blanda
and
many
parents
would
shudder
at
the
mere
thought
of
entrusting
their
children
to
us
you
have
opened
our
eyes
we
are
grateful
from
our
hearts
this
morning
we
were
taking
a
drive
and
we
witnessed
a
naïve
example
of
native
faith
it
was
out
in
the
fields
men
and
animals
were
uniting
in
prayer
to
the
to
bathe
the
thirsty
earth
with
blessed
rain
in
the
foreground
sat
the
priest
and
santries
behind
the
priestesses
in
white
garments
and
around
them
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
sheep
goats
horses
and
buffaloes
were
bound
to
stakes
a
priest
stood
before
them
and
led
the
service
praying
in
a
loud
voice
most
of
the
people
fell
in
with
in
which
chorus
the
meeting
of
the
sheep
was
blended
this
ceremony
is
called
sembajang
istira
they
prayed
for
three
days
and
three
nights
you
can
imagine
the
delight
and
gratitude
of
the
people
because
now
it
has
rained
their
prayers
were
effectual
and
do
you
know
what
they
say
now
we
can
not
get
the
idea
out
of
their
heads
that
we
had
a
share
in
it
before
this
at
other
places
the
people
had
held
sembajang
istira
but
never
a
drop
of
rain
fell
chance
willed
it
that
we
should
be
present
at
the
solemnities
here
so
our
simple
people
draw
the
conclusion
that
we
gave
strength
to
that
last
prayer
and
supplication
which
plainly
was
heard
and
answered
such
childlike
confiding
faith
is
touching
i
wish
so
often
that
i
had
a
photographic
apparatus
and
could
make
a
permanent
record
of
some
of
the
curious
things
that
i
see
among
our
people
there
is
so
much
which
we
should
like
to
preserve
so
that
we
could
give
to
outsiders
a
true
picture
of
us
javanese
it
would
mean
so
much
more
than
mere
written
description
if
they
would
see
the
whole
scene
on
the
paddi
the
buffaloes
and
the
included
i
could
then
write
what
i
as
a
child
of
java
think
and
feel
about
these
things
you
know
that
i
am
always
glad
to
be
able
to
do
anything
for
you
and
when
you
ask
a
favour
of
me
it
is
a
joyful
occasion
i
am
also
glad
to
do
what
i
can
for
east
and
west
i
feel
that
i
am
only
doing
myself
a
service
for
it
is
for
our
people
and
i
and
my
people
are
one
so
dispose
of
my
time
as
you
will
with
a
quiet
mind
and
do
not
be
afraid
that
you
will
be
asking
too
much
of
me
i
only
ask
your
forbearance
when
something
that
you
have
ordered
does
not
come
quickly
enough
i
have
talked
with
the
goldsmith
about
going
to
solo
to
learn
to
work
in
tortoiseshell
there
he
is
eager
to
go
already
he
can
make
little
combs
he
has
the
tools
for
that
but
he
does
not
understand
polishing
very
well
he
could
learn
that
at
solo
he
is
also
anxious
to
learn
to
work
in
horn
and
mother
of
pearl
that
too
could
be
learned
there
but
the
revival
of
our
art
is
just
beginning
and
naturally
all
of
these
things
can
not
be
done
at
once
i
have
had
a
pleasant
letter
from
pijzel
one
of
the
editors
of
i
also
received
some
copies
of
my
article
on
the
illustrations
are
reproduced
beautifully
do
you
not
think
so
i
have
one
set
of
them
made
on
very
fine
paper
do
you
know
what
i
think
so
splendid
that
the
very
first
time
that
i
write
for
the
public
under
my
own
name
moedertje
should
introduce
me
though
it
is
even
as
pleasant
that
the
little
article
should
be
in
demand
we
have
heard
that
in
the
minahassa
a
native
girl
has
crazy
ideas
just
as
we
have
you
see
we
are
not
the
only
simpletons
if
the
nobles
here
disdain
us
and
we
are
rejected
by
the
people
too
then
we
can
fly
away
and
seek
that
sister
soul
far
away
from
the
whirl
of
the
markets
in
some
forgotten
place
together
we
will
find
work
for
the
head
the
heart
and
the
hand
in
the
great
wide
world
somewhere
there
must
be
a
place
for
us
my
eldest
sister
has
been
here
but
she
went
away
yesterday
not
back
to
kendal
but
to
koedoes
to
visit
her
and
to
try
to
arouse
the
latter
interest
in
our
cause
some
one
goes
now
to
plead
for
us
who
herself
once
bitterly
opposed
us
when
she
was
coming
here
we
did
not
plan
an
elaborate
speech
that
would
soften
her
heart
we
talked
to
her
simply
just
as
we
felt
and
it
was
sweet
and
strange
when
our
sister
with
moist
eyes
said
tremulously
good
may
you
carry
out
your
plans
and
meet
with
success
i
shall
pray
god
to
bless
you
we
asked
her
will
you
still
cling
to
us
if
others
revile
us
and
condemn
us
and
she
answered
even
the
loudest
talkers
will
be
silent
some
day
sister
thinks
that
her
will
help
us
and
that
her
husband
too
will
have
sympathy
for
us
but
how
are
things
here
at
home
formerly
we
must
never
speak
to
others
about
the
subject
nearest
our
hearts
now
they
bring
it
up
themselves
we
talked
not
long
ago
with
a
stranger
about
several
things
my
heart
beat
with
joy
and
happiness
when
i
saw
father
standing
next
to
me
the
whole
time
i
am
his
child
in
spirit
too
sang
my
heart
father
invited
the
stranger
to
come
here
so
that
we
could
exchange
our
thoughts
and
ideas
he
thought
it
would
be
good
for
us
oh
is
my
dream
to
really
become
reality
are
we
going
on
our
way
with
our
parents
full
blessing
before
we
had
an
opportunity
to
write
to
the
heer
sijthoff
we
received
a
very
cordial
letter
from
him
last
week
reproaching
us
for
our
obstinacy
a
few
lines
further
on
he
declared
that
we
had
forced
his
respect
and
promised
to
give
us
his
support
when
we
need
it
we
have
only
to
ask
him
to
abendanon
blanda
european
those
who
live
pious
lives
and
scrupulously
observe
all
forms
of
religion
a
student
of
theology
boys
who
herd
buffaloes
lviii
i
have
been
laid
low
by
sickness
for
days
they
watched
over
me
anxiously
i
was
in
the
most
frightful
pain
thank
god
that
is
now
behind
me
and
the
suffering
is
a
thing
of
the
past
i
was
freed
from
my
pain
by
such
a
strange
remedy
we
have
preserved
it
and
given
it
to
all
of
our
family
later
it
may
do
our
children
good
yesterday
i
began
work
again
and
today
for
the
first
time
i
went
driving
father
pleasure
was
touching
naturally
i
sat
next
to
him
and
he
held
on
to
me
tightly
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
losing
me
it
was
a
delightful
hour
the
precious
memory
of
which
will
be
with
me
always
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lix
we
have
received
word
that
the
tortoiseshell
will
be
here
before
many
days
and
then
the
goldsmith
will
go
with
it
to
solo
now
all
three
branches
of
the
artistic
industry
of
my
birth
place
are
growing
and
thriving
and
we
are
still
looking
for
others
that
can
be
spurred
back
into
life
the
people
know
that
our
aim
is
their
and
they
show
their
appreciation
by
working
with
eagerness
and
enthusiasm
i
am
thankful
that
they
understand
that
we
have
their
good
always
before
our
eyes
otherwise
everything
that
we
might
do
for
them
would
be
useless
it
is
splendid
to
see
life
waking
and
stirring
around
us
they
are
beginning
to
grow
vegetables
on
a
large
scale
even
in
the
kampong
around
the
malay
camp
everything
goes
so
well
the
goldsmith
has
taken
more
boys
as
apprentices
and
there
are
some
clever
youths
that
want
to
be
educated
for
the
trade
also
i
have
noted
one
thing
with
great
pleasure
among
the
apprentices
there
is
a
boy
from
the
kota
and
consequently
not
a
child
of
the
village
we
have
to
seek
out
other
apprentices
but
this
boy
from
the
kota
came
of
himself
and
asked
us
to
take
him
the
little
ones
here
will
carry
on
our
work
when
we
are
gone
we
can
lead
them
from
a
distance
so
long
as
they
need
leading
some
one
complained
to
us
about
ingratitude
among
our
inferiors
we
told
him
that
if
he
were
distressed
at
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
it
was
his
own
fault
he
looked
at
us
with
his
great
eyes
and
said
my
fault
when
people
are
ungrateful
to
me
yes
your
fault
when
you
allow
yourself
to
be
distressed
by
it
for
we
must
never
do
good
with
the
thought
of
gratitude
before
our
eyes
we
must
do
good
simply
because
it
is
good
and
because
only
in
so
doing
will
we
fulfil
ourselves
i
believe
that
to
be
happy
ourselves
and
to
make
others
happy
we
must
understand
the
more
we
understand
the
less
bitterness
we
feel
and
the
easier
it
is
to
be
just
he
asked
us
too
what
would
happen
if
you
should
meet
some
one
in
whose
presence
your
heart
would
beat
i
should
be
happy
and
thankful
because
that
would
indicate
that
i
had
met
a
companion
soul
and
the
more
companion
souls
we
find
the
better
it
is
for
our
cause
and
that
of
those
whom
we
love
you
will
never
meet
a
companion
soul
that
was
said
forcefully
what
did
he
mean
does
he
place
our
men
too
low
or
me
undeservedly
high
if
he
but
knew
i
had
just
received
an
enthusiastic
letter
from
a
young
and
to
me
unknown
companion
soul
i
shall
send
the
letter
to
you
it
is
from
a
student
of
the
native
artisans
school
a
spontaneous
expression
of
sympathy
about
the
article
that
appeared
in
which
you
induced
me
to
write
it
is
so
like
a
young
boy
young
in
its
glowing
enthusiasm
but
through
it
a
spirit
speaks
that
is
far
from
commonplace
there
is
candour
in
every
line
that
is
a
luxury
which
writers
can
enjoy
unknown
people
feel
that
they
are
friends
when
they
strike
a
sympathetic
chord
i
love
to
think
that
it
was
you
who
induced
me
to
make
my
own
name
known
to
the
public
and
such
an
introduction
from
one
whom
i
admire
deeply
is
like
a
benediction
if
that
article
has
met
with
success
i
attribute
it
to
the
fact
that
it
first
saw
the
light
through
your
hands
there
were
many
things
that
had
to
be
included
in
that
introduction
but
in
none
of
them
did
it
miss
its
mark
its
success
has
meant
much
to
our
artists
and
since
its
appearance
many
questions
have
come
to
me
about
our
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lx
it
is
stupid
and
unpardonable
that
we
did
not
write
to
you
as
soon
as
the
great
decision
was
made
that
we
were
not
to
eat
the
fruit
of
the
noble
work
which
you
and
others
have
done
for
us
no
one
could
be
more
surprised
at
this
determination
than
we
ourselves
we
had
been
prepared
for
anything
but
we
had
never
expected
that
we
would
say
of
our
own
free
will
we
want
to
stay
but
do
not
think
of
us
think
of
the
cause
and
what
will
be
best
for
that
it
is
there
we
must
rest
our
case
do
not
think
that
our
feelings
have
changed
they
have
not
when
our
request
was
on
the
way
to
the
governor
general
we
believed
firmly
that
for
the
sake
of
our
future
pupils
education
in
europe
was
an
absolute
necessity
but
after
that
another
truth
was
impressed
upon
us
at
this
time
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
cause
if
we
remained
in
india
you
know
that
it
is
our
dearest
wish
to
complete
our
educations
in
europe
can
you
realize
what
it
will
cost
us
to
give
up
the
idea
on
the
very
eve
of
its
realization
we
have
been
through
a
terrible
struggle
but
we
threw
aside
our
own
desires
when
we
found
that
the
cause
could
be
served
best
in
a
different
way
we
saw
this
as
soon
as
we
ceased
to
think
of
ourselves
but
only
of
our
cause
the
people
for
whom
we
wish
to
work
must
learn
to
know
us
if
we
went
away
we
should
become
as
strangers
to
them
and
when
after
some
years
we
came
back
they
would
see
in
us
only
european
women
if
the
people
do
not
like
to
trust
their
daughters
to
european
women
how
much
less
would
they
be
willing
to
trust
them
to
those
who
were
worse
in
their
eyes
javanese
turned
european
our
aim
is
our
people
and
if
they
should
be
set
against
us
of
what
good
would
the
help
of
the
government
be
we
ought
to
strike
as
quickly
as
possible
and
place
before
the
public
as
an
accomplished
fact
a
school
for
native
girls
just
now
they
are
talking
about
us
and
we
are
known
over
the
whole
of
java
we
must
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
if
we
went
away
interest
would
grow
and
after
a
time
dwindle
away
altogether
now
we
can
make
ourselves
personally
known
to
our
people
seek
to
win
their
sympathy
teach
them
to
trust
us
if
we
had
their
sympathy
and
their
trust
then
we
should
be
at
peace
we
have
not
entirely
given
up
the
idea
of
going
to
holland
stella
we
could
still
go
always
and
if
we
should
go
from
batavia
it
would
be
better
than
from
here
our
parents
would
then
be
accustomed
to
having
us
at
a
distance
and
after
they
had
once
gotten
used
to
the
idea
it
would
not
be
so
hard
for
them
if
the
distance
were
made
greater
for
us
too
that
would
have
a
good
side
consider
this
we
have
never
been
away
from
home
and
if
we
were
suddenly
taken
from
our
warm
little
nest
from
our
own
country
and
placed
in
another
environment
far
from
all
who
loved
us
the
change
would
be
great
but
that
is
only
a
side
issue
we
knew
that
all
along
and
had
never
seen
anything
against
it
the
main
question
is
the
danger
to
our
undertaking
itself
we
had
never
looked
at
the
other
side
from
defiant
courage
or
courageous
defiance
call
it
what
you
will
carried
away
by
our
enthusiasm
we
thought
little
or
not
at
all
of
the
temper
of
the
public
yes
we
thought
it
to
our
credit
to
defy
it
and
to
hold
our
own
ideas
high
against
the
world
not
disturbing
ourselves
one
way
or
another
about
its
approbation
so
long
as
we
ourselves
were
convinced
of
the
holiness
of
our
cause
we
still
think
that
is
right
but
in
this
instance
we
may
not
live
up
to
our
ideal
for
now
everything
depends
for
us
upon
the
good
will
of
the
public
always
we
wish
to
work
for
the
good
of
our
people
and
we
must
not
set
them
against
us
by
crushing
with
relentless
hands
the
ideas
upon
which
they
have
thriven
and
grown
old
through
the
centuries
patience
the
wise
have
said
to
us
all
along
we
heard
them
but
did
not
understand
now
we
are
beginning
to
understand
stella
now
we
know
that
the
watchword
of
all
reformers
must
be
patience
we
can
not
hasten
the
course
of
events
we
only
retard
them
when
we
try
to
push
forward
too
hastily
if
the
public
should
be
aroused
against
us
the
whole
cause
would
be
held
back
people
would
be
unwilling
to
give
their
daughters
a
liberal
education
for
education
would
be
held
responsible
for
such
impossible
creatures
as
we
patience
patience
even
unto
eternity
stella
i
was
so
miserable
when
this
truth
penetrated
at
last
we
must
curb
ourselves
in
our
enthusiasm
we
will
not
pass
our
goal
without
seeing
it
mevrouw
van
kol
wrote
to
us
that
before
we
can
realize
an
ideal
we
must
first
lose
many
illusions
the
first
illusion
that
we
have
thrown
aside
is
not
to
give
ourselves
to
the
public
frankly
just
as
we
are
no
that
may
not
be
the
public
must
not
know
what
we
are
really
fighting
the
name
of
the
enemy
against
which
we
take
the
field
must
never
never
be
cried
aloud
it
is
polygamy
if
that
word
were
heard
no
man
would
trust
his
child
to
us
i
have
struggled
against
this
it
is
as
though
we
began
our
work
with
a
lie
we
hoped
to
make
ourselves
known
just
as
we
were
and
that
even
so
from
conviction
that
we
were
right
parents
would
send
their
children
to
us
it
would
be
impossible
we
have
not
yet
begun
our
work
and
yet
we
have
seen
our
illusions
dwindle
away
one
by
one
oh
stella
do
not
make
the
loss
of
this
great
illusion
harder
to
us
by
your
sorrow
it
is
hard
enough
as
it
is
you
have
always
known
that
it
was
my
dearest
wish
to
go
to
your
country
and
to
gather
wisdom
there
for
my
own
people
let
us
never
speak
of
it
again
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
my
parents
too
a
thousand
times
for
all
that
you
have
done
for
us
and
for
nothing
no
stella
your
work
is
not
lost
the
work
of
you
all
though
we
may
make
no
use
of
its
fruits
now
it
will
be
of
great
good
to
our
cause
attention
will
have
been
drawn
to
it
before
this
questions
relating
to
the
education
of
the
javanese
people
have
always
been
brought
up
by
those
who
had
some
interest
of
their
own
at
stake
now
the
interest
is
free
from
ulterior
motive
would
that
have
been
the
case
if
you
had
not
drawn
the
attention
of
the
liberal
to
us
would
the
government
have
been
ready
to
help
us
if
you
had
not
worked
for
us
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
your
great
love
in
the
name
of
my
people
i
thank
you
sincerely
great
good
will
come
of
your
work
for
the
javanese
be
sure
of
that
our
plan
is
if
our
request
is
answered
favourably
to
go
at
once
to
batavia
roekmini
will
study
drawing
handiwork
hygiene
and
nursing
in
drawing
she
will
have
lessons
from
the
teacher
at
the
gymnasium
and
she
will
take
the
course
in
hygiene
at
the
school
i
shall
take
a
normal
course
continuing
the
same
studies
with
which
i
have
already
been
working
here
for
several
months
to
mejuffrouw
zeehandelaar
lxi
whatever
the
future
may
have
in
store
for
us
i
pray
that
we
may
always
remain
confident
and
gay
and
full
of
faith
i
have
said
so
often
to
others
do
not
despair
do
not
curse
your
cross
weary
one
through
suffering
comes
power
now
it
is
my
fate
to
apply
what
i
have
been
preaching
but
i
will
not
think
any
more
of
strife
or
suffering
of
care
and
of
anxiety
it
makes
my
head
so
tired
and
my
heart
so
sick
i
will
smell
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
bathe
in
the
sunshine
they
are
always
here
to
comfort
us
moeske
we
have
begun
our
work
we
thank
your
husband
for
his
advice
to
begin
at
once
just
as
we
were
we
had
not
dared
to
hope
that
it
would
begin
so
easily
we
started
with
one
pupil
quickly
the
number
jumped
to
five
and
tomorrow
morning
eight
will
come
to
the
kaboepaten
and
soon
there
will
be
ten
we
are
so
pleased
when
we
look
at
our
little
children
they
are
such
a
fresh
unspoiled
little
band
they
always
come
exquisitely
neat
and
they
get
along
so
amiably
together
they
learned
to
trust
us
quickly
while
they
pay
all
due
respect
to
form
they
are
still
as
free
and
unrestrained
before
us
as
though
there
were
no
such
thing
as
rank
or
difference
of
degree
the
day
before
yesterday
the
djaksa
of
karimoen
djawa
brought
a
daughter
to
me
picture
it
moeske
they
send
their
daughters
away
from
home
and
let
them
eat
with
us
here
in
a
strange
place
yesterday
a
young
mother
came
to
me
in
great
distress
she
said
that
she
lived
too
far
away
if
it
were
not
so
she
would
be
so
glad
to
come
and
study
with
us
herself
as
that
can
not
be
she
wants
to
provide
for
her
little
daughter
the
education
which
she
has
not
had
the
opportunity
to
gain
her
child
is
not
yet
a
year
old
as
soon
as
she
is
six
years
old
her
mother
will
send
her
to
us
wherever
we
may
be
the
children
come
here
four
days
in
the
week
from
eight
to
half
past
twelve
they
study
writing
reading
handiwork
and
cooking
we
teachers
do
not
give
lessons
in
art
unless
the
pupils
show
a
special
aptitude
for
it
our
school
must
not
have
the
air
of
a
school
or
we
that
of
it
must
be
like
a
great
household
of
which
we
are
the
mothers
we
will
try
and
teach
them
love
as
we
understand
it
by
word
and
deed
in
our
own
youth
we
were
guided
by
that
simple
precept
which
is
universally
understood
do
not
unto
others
what
you
do
not
wish
done
unto
yourself
mevrouw
van
kol
has
told
us
much
of
your
jesus
and
of
the
apostles
peter
and
paul
of
whatever
belief
or
race
a
man
may
be
a
great
soul
is
a
great
soul
a
noble
character
a
noble
character
i
have
read
quo
vadis
and
i
have
been
thrilled
with
admiration
for
the
martyrs
to
their
faith
who
amid
the
bitterest
suffering
still
looked
faithfully
and
trustingly
toward
the
highest
and
proclaimed
his
praise
in
beautiful
song
i
have
suffered
with
them
and
i
have
rejoiced
with
them
do
you
know
we
two
by
edna
lyall
that
is
a
very
fine
book
it
treats
of
atheism
and
christianity
of
true
christianity
and
of
its
frightful
perversion
of
which
alas
there
is
so
much
in
the
world
the
atheist
luke
raeburn
is
a
great
figure
and
erica
raeburn
too
is
a
noble
character
who
from
a
zealous
atheist
becomes
a
sincere
and
believing
christian
they
were
a
father
and
daughter
who
loved
each
other
devotedly
and
depended
each
upon
the
other
we
read
too
the
soul
of
a
people
that
is
about
buddhism
and
is
also
a
beautiful
book
we
are
anxious
now
to
read
something
about
judaism
do
you
not
say
that
perhaps
zangwill
book
dreams
of
the
ghetto
will
be
what
we
seek
to
mevrouw
abendanon
written
with
a
pencil
after
an
illness
a
group
of
islands
off
the
coast
of
japara
lxii
a
few
words
to
announce
to
you
as
briefly
as
possible
a
new
turn
in
my
life
i
shall
not
go
on
with
our
great
work
as
a
woman
alone
a
noble
man
will
be
at
my
side
to
help
me
he
is
ahead
of
me
in
work
for
our
people
he
has
already
won
his
spurs
while
i
am
just
beginning
oh
he
is
such
a
lovable
good
man
he
has
a
noble
heart
and
a
clever
head
as
well
and
he
has
been
to
holland
where
his
bride
would
so
gladly
go
but
must
not
for
her
people
sake
it
is
a
great
change
but
if
we
work
together
and
support
and
help
one
another
we
may
be
able
to
take
a
far
shorter
road
to
the
realization
of
our
hopes
than
could
either
alone
we
meet
at
many
many
points
you
do
not
yet
know
the
name
of
my
betrothed
it
is
raden
adipati
djojo
adiningrat
regent
of
rembang
and
now
adieu
soon
i
shall
write
again
and
i
hope
at
greater
length
to
mevrouw
van
kol
lxiii
i
want
to
make
myself
worthy
of
the
highest
title
and
that
is
a
child
of
god
have
i
not
told
you
often
that
we
were
done
with
all
personal
happiness
now
life
comes
to
demand
that
promise
of
me
i
have
said
that
nothing
could
be
too
bitter
or
too
hard
for
us
if
it
would
but
enable
us
to
add
one
little
grain
of
sand
to
the
building
of
that
great
structure
the
happiness
of
a
people
now
i
have
been
tested
what
am
i
worth
yesterday
was
again
an
exciting
day
for
us
we
received
a
communication
from
the
department
of
education
telling
us
if
we
did
not
wish
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
granted
us
to
be
educated
as
teachers
to
send
a
statement
accordingly
in
writing
to
the
governor
general
how
must
the
statement
which
has
been
asked
for
be
worded
briefly
and
to
the
point
that
i
no
longer
wish
to
make
use
of
the
offered
opportunity
because
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
or
because
now
a
still
better
opportunity
has
presented
itself
to
me
of
working
for
our
people
at
the
side
of
a
noble
man
whom
i
respect
who
loves
the
people
with
me
and
who
will
ably
support
me
in
my
work
i
shall
be
of
much
greater
service
with
him
than
we
two
as
women
standing
alone
could
ever
be
and
roekmini
does
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
because
she
may
not
nor
does
she
wish
even
if
she
could
to
go
alone
she
will
reach
her
goal
in
a
different
way
then
i
wish
to
express
my
respect
and
gratitude
to
the
government
for
having
taken
the
interests
of
java
to
heart
and
because
when
a
child
of
the
people
asked
for
aid
it
lent
an
ear
to
her
request
and
was
willing
to
meet
her
half
way
in
her
regard
for
the
future
welfare
of
her
race
holland
has
now
grown
nearer
to
us
we
are
convinced
now
that
the
netherlands
wishes
the
happiness
of
india
that
is
no
hollow
phrase
we
mean
it
all
of
my
friends
among
my
humble
fellow
countrymen
have
always
wished
and
prayed
this
for
me
that
bendora
adjeng
tini
might
go
nowhere
but
to
a
kaboepaten
and
the
simple
minded
hearts
rejoice
now
because
their
dream
is
to
be
realized
they
are
happy
because
their
wish
for
their
bendora
is
coming
true
you
see
how
my
simple
friends
triumph
vox
populi
vox
dei
if
that
is
true
then
it
is
under
the
guidance
of
a
higher
power
that
my
path
in
life
has
taken
a
different
direction
from
that
which
i
myself
had
planned
may
you
be
a
blessing
a
refuge
to
many
the
tree
in
whose
shade
they
find
refuge
from
the
heat
of
the
day
that
is
what
many
old
people
here
pray
for
me
may
i
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
these
who
are
simple
of
heart
a
great
task
lies
before
me
unquestionably
it
is
hard
but
if
i
succeed
and
bring
it
to
a
good
end
i
shall
serve
our
people
as
i
could
never
have
served
them
in
any
other
way
if
my
work
is
well
done
it
will
be
a
lesson
that
will
have
a
powerful
effect
upon
our
cause
because
to
my
fellow
countrymen
my
future
will
be
the
most
beautiful
and
desirable
in
the
world
the
mere
fact
of
my
marriage
will
do
good
it
will
interest
the
parents
spur
them
on
to
educate
their
daughters
and
impress
them
more
than
could
a
thousand
inspired
words
it
stands
for
a
fact
that
beauty
and
riches
are
to
be
despised
before
gifts
of
the
heart
and
mind
i
remember
my
own
words
when
some
one
asked
me
how
the
idea
of
education
could
be
impressed
upon
our
women
and
girls
the
javanese
people
are
just
like
other
children
of
nature
they
are
children
of
the
sun
worshippers
of
splendour
and
brilliancy
very
well
gratify
that
wish
give
them
what
their
hearts
desire
but
at
the
same
time
give
them
something
that
is
true
that
is
of
real
worth
now
we
shall
not
infringe
too
harshly
upon
the
customs
of
our
land
our
childlike
people
can
still
have
their
pomp
and
splendour
the
freedom
of
women
is
inevitable
it
is
coming
but
we
can
not
hasten
it
the
course
of
destiny
can
not
be
turned
aside
but
in
the
end
the
triumph
has
been
foreordained
we
shall
not
be
living
to
see
it
but
what
will
that
matter
we
have
helped
to
break
the
path
that
leads
to
it
and
that
is
a
glorious
privilege
do
not
be
uneasy
my
betrothed
will
not
cut
my
wings
short
the
fact
that
i
can
fly
is
just
what
has
raised
me
so
high
in
his
eyes
he
will
only
give
a
larger
opportunity
to
stretch
out
my
wings
he
will
help
me
to
broaden
my
field
of
work
he
appreciates
your
meiske
for
herself
and
not
as
a
possible
ornament
for
his
home
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lxiv
do
you
know
what
day
this
is
it
is
the
third
anniversary
of
our
meeting
three
years
ago
today
three
simple
childlike
girls
received
a
costly
gift
from
heaven
the
gift
of
a
friend
after
their
own
hearts
the
childlike
girls
have
grown
to
be
women
life
has
furrowed
wrinkles
in
the
still
young
faces
their
hearts
have
been
through
fire
have
they
wasted
and
gone
to
ashes
or
have
they
come
forth
from
the
fire
purified
just
now
we
have
company
at
the
table
where
i
sit
there
are
five
of
us
working
justinah
the
wise
woman
came
this
morning
and
will
stay
until
next
week
we
think
her
a
treasure
she
spends
her
time
here
usefully
teaches
embroidery
and
is
so
severe
when
we
are
careless
when
we
make
a
mistake
she
immediately
pulls
everything
out
how
rich
i
felt
this
morning
when
she
laid
her
hand
trustingly
on
my
shoulder
while
i
explained
something
or
other
to
her
now
she
feels
at
home
with
us
i
look
with
so
much
pleasure
into
her
fine
intelligent
eyes
they
say
so
much
she
is
a
oh
how
full
of
love
is
her
calling
you
would
enjoy
meeting
her
she
listens
with
attention
when
one
speaks
and
then
asks
such
intelligent
questions
if
you
ever
come
to
our
neighbourhood
again
i
hope
to
be
able
to
take
her
to
you
this
clever
little
woman
has
already
attended
women
in
and
she
is
such
a
young
thing
still
with
all
a
child
eagerness
the
regent
of
rembang
comes
on
the
seventeenth
of
this
month
i
have
asked
him
to
bring
his
children
with
him
i
am
so
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
my
future
family
the
children
are
to
be
my
future
and
i
shall
live
and
work
for
them
strive
and
suffer
if
need
be
for
them
i
hope
that
they
will
love
me
i
have
asked
their
father
to
give
the
entire
control
of
his
children
to
me
my
dream
is
to
make
them
feel
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
that
they
are
my
own
children
there
are
others
that
call
themselves
my
children
the
here
a
rich
regent
son
and
heir
said
make
my
child
your
servant
let
her
scrub
the
floor
draw
water
anything
that
you
will
if
you
will
but
let
her
stay
with
you
i
listened
with
a
smile
on
my
face
but
i
felt
like
crying
i
said
nothing
promised
nothing
but
only
prayed
silently
that
i
might
lock
all
the
little
children
entrusted
to
me
safely
in
my
heart
and
nourish
them
with
my
love
i
am
only
going
to
take
one
child
with
me
to
my
new
dwelling
a
girl
of
eight
or
so
who
has
been
given
into
my
care
by
her
parents
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
teacher
and
has
been
to
school
she
is
a
lovely
child
clever
and
quick
if
she
shows
any
inclination
at
all
i
shall
educate
her
for
some
profession
now
she
receives
lessons
from
my
sister
in
handiwork
in
the
rembang
there
are
women
and
children
of
gentle
birth
who
have
been
educated
i
shall
try
to
gain
their
interest
in
our
work
later
my
future
is
already
tainted
by
a
western
education
that
will
be
pleasant
for
me
my
days
at
home
are
numbered
only
two
more
short
months
and
my
future
protector
will
come
for
me
he
and
his
younger
brother
the
regent
of
toeban
have
been
here
the
day
is
set
it
is
the
twelfth
of
november
the
wedding
will
be
very
quiet
only
our
families
will
be
present
and
neither
of
us
is
to
wear
bridal
dress
he
will
be
in
his
uniform
as
i
have
already
seen
him
that
is
my
wish
his
children
are
not
coming
to
my
great
disappointment
they
are
still
too
little
and
the
journey
is
tiresome
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lxv
i
shall
find
a
rich
field
of
work
at
rembang
and
thank
god
there
i
shall
not
stand
alone
he
has
promised
to
stand
at
my
side
and
support
me
it
is
also
his
wish
and
his
hope
to
support
me
in
my
efforts
to
help
our
people
he
himself
has
already
laboured
diligently
for
their
welfare
for
years
he
too
would
like
to
help
in
the
work
of
education
and
though
he
can
not
give
personal
instruction
himself
he
can
have
it
done
by
others
many
of
his
various
relatives
are
being
educated
at
his
expense
he
expects
me
to
be
a
blessing
to
him
and
to
his
people
may
he
not
be
disappointed
i
am
very
grateful
for
one
thing
his
family
share
his
ideas
and
approve
of
his
choice
they
look
upon
me
as
the
future
rearer
of
their
children
and
i
really
hope
to
serve
in
that
capacity
i
do
not
think
of
anything
else
sometimes
i
forget
that
i
have
lost
so
many
beautiful
illusions
and
i
think
that
i
am
still
following
my
calling
only
along
a
different
way
from
the
one
that
i
had
mapped
out
for
myself
and
i
shall
think
that
always
it
gives
me
peace
and
helps
me
to
be
cheerful
nothing
is
perfect
and
nothing
may
ever
be
perfect
in
this
world
i
had
hoped
and
prayed
that
i
might
become
the
mother
and
sister
of
many
and
god
has
heard
my
prayer
though
it
is
a
little
different
from
what
i
meant
it
is
one
of
his
dreams
too
to
be
able
to
raise
up
our
people
he
is
truly
good
to
his
people
and
to
the
officials
under
him
they
feed
out
of
his
hand
day
before
yesterday
a
collector
was
here
and
spent
the
whole
evening
talking
to
father
about
his
daughter
he
wishes
me
to
undertake
her
education
his
wife
has
already
spoken
to
me
and
now
he
came
to
talk
to
father
i
am
asked
to
take
other
children
from
here
i
do
not
know
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
take
them
all
it
is
hard
to
refuse
but
i
will
promise
nothing
we
shall
first
see
how
it
goes
we
shall
wait
some
days
before
coming
to
the
hard
duty
of
making
a
decision
and
meanwhile
i
shall
not
speak
of
it
save
under
stress
of
urgent
necessity
i
will
be
forgiven
when
they
see
that
i
do
not
refuse
from
pride
but
from
expediency
and
out
of
consideration
for
others
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
their
own
children
too
fortunately
rembang
is
a
quiet
little
place
and
it
is
good
that
he
cares
as
little
as
i
for
amusements
i
am
delighted
that
the
resident
there
is
interested
in
our
cause
so
that
i
shall
not
go
as
a
stranger
and
there
will
be
my
great
friend
the
sea
it
lies
not
more
than
a
hundred
feet
from
the
house
when
they
told
him
that
i
was
much
interested
in
the
art
and
kindred
industries
of
our
people
he
said
that
there
were
goldsmiths
and
there
they
only
needed
a
little
directing
and
listen
to
this
it
is
something
very
pleasant
perhaps
our
good
friend
singowirio
will
go
there
with
me
you
know
whom
i
mean
the
man
from
he
could
not
have
followed
his
bendoro
to
batavia
but
now
that
the
plan
is
somewhat
different
he
is
anxious
to
go
we
are
planning
to
take
him
but
capital
and
leadership
are
needed
first
of
all
before
our
artistic
industries
can
be
placed
upon
a
practical
basis
a
large
ought
to
be
built
and
many
apprentices
and
artisans
taken
to
work
under
regular
supervision
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
if
we
only
had
the
money
we
could
build
a
buy
material
employ
workmen
and
train
apprentices
singo
could
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
establishment
i
believe
in
less
than
a
year
or
two
years
at
most
the
capital
thus
invested
would
be
doubled
i
should
have
been
glad
to
begin
here
but
both
of
us
had
our
eyes
upon
batavia
when
we
were
gone
our
little
sisters
would
have
had
to
take
the
responsibility
for
everything
and
that
would
have
been
too
hard
for
them
now
it
is
different
we
could
take
the
responsibility
if
we
had
the
necessary
money
i
am
convinced
that
our
artistic
industry
has
a
great
future
not
long
ago
while
we
were
on
a
little
journey
we
met
the
heer
brandes
brother
of
doctor
brandes
he
expressed
much
interest
in
the
art
of
our
country
when
i
told
him
of
a
tokootje
of
productions
of
native
art
at
semarang
he
set
out
immediately
to
look
for
it
you
must
understand
that
the
people
of
semarang
are
opposed
to
sending
the
products
of
their
own
neighbourhood
to
batavia
east
and
west
wishes
to
open
a
tokootje
at
semarang
but
again
money
is
needed
and
east
and
west
can
not
give
very
much
as
yet
when
i
told
heer
brandes
this
he
said
oh
do
not
worry
about
that
the
money
will
be
found
if
you
will
only
take
care
of
the
other
side
i
said
but
there
must
be
some
one
of
discrimination
who
will
stay
at
semarang
that
will
be
found
too
and
your
only
care
will
be
to
see
that
beautiful
things
are
produced
i
have
received
a
short
letter
from
him
he
has
spoken
to
various
friends
about
the
plan
and
they
were
all
much
interested
and
have
promised
their
financial
support
i
spoke
to
him
of
our
other
idea
in
regard
to
the
art
of
at
once
he
asked
how
much
money
we
would
need
for
that
i
did
not
mention
any
certain
amount
i
must
first
ask
those
who
know
how
much
the
would
cost
how
much
the
wood
and
how
what
wages
would
have
to
be
paid
out
to
the
workmen
every
month
the
could
be
very
simple
at
first
the
great
difficulty
is
that
there
must
be
a
force
of
fifty
men
kept
steadily
working
and
there
would
have
to
be
money
with
which
to
pay
them
because
they
could
not
afford
to
wait
for
their
wages
until
their
work
was
sold
rembang
would
be
an
excellent
country
for
it
is
the
land
of
dati
and
there
is
also
much
sono
there
singo
himself
thinks
the
idea
excellent
if
we
only
had
the
money
if
everything
goes
well
what
a
retinue
i
shall
take
with
me
even
though
i
am
a
modern
woman
i
shall
certainly
have
a
strange
bridal
dower
the
regent
of
rembang
is
marrying
a
whole
what
business
has
he
to
put
himself
between
the
people
and
their
bride
oh
heavens
i
shall
strike
an
unfortunate
time
for
i
shall
arrive
in
the
dry
season
of
the
year
nieuwjaar
i
have
said
all
along
that
i
would
not
allow
my
foot
to
be
kissed
i
could
never
allow
any
one
to
do
that
i
want
a
place
in
their
hearts
not
outward
forms
i
can
not
think
of
the
future
without
my
roekmini
how
shall
i
get
along
without
her
and
she
without
me
when
i
think
of
her
my
eyes
stay
wide
open
the
whole
night
long
to
mevrouw
abendanon
little
shop
lxvi
do
you
know
what
has
happened
at
his
earnest
request
the
date
has
been
changed
the
wedding
will
not
be
on
the
twelfth
but
on
the
eighth
of
november
and
on
wednesday
the
eleventh
at
about
five
i
shall
leave
my
home
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lxvii
our
girl
is
alive
again
she
is
alive
her
heart
glows
and
thrills
and
it
is
not
burning
pain
or
bitter
dumb
despair
that
makes
the
strings
vibrate
love
is
sounding
the
chords
why
did
i
complain
ungrateful
that
i
was
with
such
a
rich
treasure
within
me
love
is
greater
than
all
else
and
she
is
richest
who
gives
most
and
i
shall
give
as
a
rich
father
child
with
a
full
hand
what
has
been
given
me
i
shall
give
back
with
interest
oh
there
are
so
many
that
hunger
and
thirst
after
love
strange
and
wonderful
things
can
happen
in
life
he
and
father
were
drawn
together
from
the
very
first
moment
that
they
set
eyes
upon
each
other
two
years
ago
he
and
father
have
been
friends
ever
since
and
he
has
visited
us
often
it
was
one
of
his
poor
little
wife
wishes
to
come
and
see
us
with
him
and
all
of
the
children
both
of
them
called
my
father
father
she
was
so
anxious
to
make
our
acquaintance
alas
before
her
wish
could
be
granted
death
took
her
away
shortly
before
her
death
he
saw
his
wife
in
a
dream
she
was
deep
in
fervent
prayer
and
the
prayer
that
was
sent
up
to
the
was
that
she
and
raden
adjeng
kartini
might
meet
and
be
friends
through
all
eternity
since
that
time
i
have
never
been
out
of
his
thoughts
yes
he
has
suffered
much
when
she
went
away
it
was
a
deep
blow
to
him
he
loved
her
very
dearly
and
his
hope
for
himself
is
that
father
treasure
his
wasiat
djati
as
he
calls
me
shall
help
him
to
forget
his
grief
may
i
not
find
a
little
message
from
you
when
on
the
eleventh
i
enter
my
new
home
for
the
first
time
it
will
be
as
if
you
had
raised
your
dear
hand
to
bless
me
to
mevrouw
abendanon
heir
to
his
existence
in
whom
his
whole
being
begins
and
ends
lxviii
my
dearest
moedertje
this
is
the
last
greeting
from
your
little
daughter
as
a
young
girl
on
the
day
before
her
wedding
tomorrow
at
six
we
are
to
be
married
i
know
that
tomorrow
my
whole
heart
will
be
with
you
my
dearest
greet
your
husband
heartily
for
me
and
remember
that
you
will
always
have
the
deep
affection
of
your
own
little
daughter
to
mevrouw
abendanon
lxix
my
dearest
best
friends
you
do
not
know
with
what
affection
this
my
first
letter
from
my
new
home
is
written
a
home
where
praise
god
there
is
peace
and
love
everywhere
and
we
are
all
happy
with
and
through
one
another
i
regret
so
deeply
that
only
through
the
press
of
circumstances
i
have
not
been
able
to
write
to
you
before
forgive
me
the
first
days
were
so
frightfully
hard
then
our
children
were
ailing
and
at
last
i
felt
the
reaction
from
the
wearisome
days
through
which
we
had
passed
i
was
far
from
well
and
was
obliged
to
take
care
of
myself
now
i
am
again
fresh
and
happy
once
more
it
is
the
old
irresponsible
creature
of
other
days
who
can
look
forward
to
the
future
with
smiling
eyes
do
i
have
to
express
myself
still
more
plainly
dearest
i
bless
the
day
on
which
i
laid
my
hand
in
that
of
him
who
was
sent
by
the
to
be
my
comrade
in
the
journey
through
this
great
and
difficult
life
everything
that
was
noble
and
beautiful
in
my
eyes
i
find
here
realized
before
me
some
of
the
dreams
that
i
still
dream
he
has
carried
out
years
ago
or
he
dreams
them
now
with
me
we
are
so
entirely
one
in
thought
and
ideas
that
often
i
am
frightened
you
would
both
love
him
if
you
knew
him
you
would
admire
his
clear
brain
and
honour
his
good
heart
i
have
thought
so
often
that
the
noble
should
live
for
the
people
and
i
have
wanted
to
preach
this
aloud
our
nobles
would
not
care
to
hear
it
but
he
my
heart
king
has
gone
before
me
it
is
just
a
month
today
since
my
husband
brought
me
here
to
his
country
and
led
me
into
his
house
now
our
home
the
queen
could
not
have
been
more
warmly
welcomed
all
of
rembang
made
festival
even
on
the
border
every
house
was
decorated
with
flags
the
very
hired
carriages
on
the
highways
bore
the
tricolour
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
was
so
spontaneous
and
genuine
the
expressions
of
sympathy
came
so
warmly
from
their
hearts
the
people
were
gay
and
rejoiced
because
their
beloved
ruler
was
happy
again
and
again
my
husband
took
me
out
on
the
balcony
the
people
must
see
his
new
i
sat
on
a
stool
near
him
silent
my
eyes
full
of
tears
and
my
heart
overflowing
with
emotion
there
was
happiness
there
was
gratitude
there
was
pride
pride
in
him
that
he
had
gained
such
a
warm
place
in
the
heart
of
the
people
gratitude
because
one
of
my
dearest
dreams
was
realized
and
happiness
because
i
sat
there
at
his
side
and
our
children
how
can
i
tell
you
of
these
delights
i
felt
drawn
to
them
at
once
they
are
such
dear
unspoiled
creatures
and
every
day
they
grow
closer
and
closer
to
my
heart
their
father
has
laid
a
good
foundation
to
their
education
it
began
just
as
i
always
wished
education
to
begin
in
simplicity
and
modesty
my
little
treasures
do
not
hold
themselves
above
the
most
humble
person
here
in
the
house
every
one
is
alike
to
them
the
field
is
prepared
i
have
only
to
go
forth
and
sow
in
january
i
hope
to
be
able
to
open
our
little
school
we
are
looking
for
a
good
teacher
and
till
we
have
found
one
i
shall
have
charge
of
the
lessons
myself
if
unforeseen
circumstances
should
intervene
and
i
be
prevented
in
any
way
one
of
my
sisters
will
carry
on
the
work
for
me
till
i
am
able
to
take
charge
of
it
again
several
parents
have
already
asked
me
to
teach
their
children
our
idea
is
to
open
a
school
for
daughters
of
the
native
chiefs
here
if
we
can
get
a
suitable
teacher
if
we
could
find
a
good
governess
then
she
could
care
for
the
mental
development
of
our
children
and
also
for
the
formation
of
their
characters
when
everything
is
in
good
working
order
could
we
not
hope
for
a
subsidy
from
the
government
the
expenses
of
the
school
would
be
as
low
as
possible
the
children
would
receive
their
board
and
lodging
free
from
us
shall
i
write
a
letter
about
it
the
parents
are
full
of
confidence
and
are
asking
us
to
take
their
children
this
is
now
our
opportunity
we
must
begin
after
a
while
i
shall
write
to
you
at
greater
length
about
our
plans
i
have
the
fullest
confidence
that
a
girls
school
held
by
us
at
our
home
under
the
direction
of
a
european
teacher
with
me
as
head
mistress
would
succeed
we
have
great
plans
and
we
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
talk
this
over
with
you
and
your
husband
face
to
face
i
am
writing
this
at
five
in
the
morning
the
children
are
awake
and
hanging
over
my
chair
mother
must
give
them
bread
and
milk
you
must
see
our
youngest
just
once
he
is
not
yet
two
years
old
but
so
intelligent
as
i
sat
here
he
came
with
a
little
footstool
it
was
too
heavy
for
him
to
carry
so
he
dragged
it
to
mother
mother
feet
must
not
hang
then
the
darling
child
climbed
on
my
lap
when
i
call
the
children
to
me
they
fight
to
see
which
one
shall
reach
me
first
and
our
little
sister
brings
me
the
spoons
and
forks
the
one
who
is
naughty
must
not
come
to
mother
they
have
the
greatest
fun
when
they
bathe
with
me
and
i
too
enjoy
this
more
than
anything
else
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
see
the
fresh
laughing
little
faces
and
now
i
am
going
to
talk
about
myself
i
have
not
thanked
you
yet
for
the
many
expressions
of
love
which
we
have
received
from
you
of
late
i
was
made
so
happy
by
the
letter
from
your
husband
and
yourself
which
i
received
at
japara
my
warmest
thanks
to
you
both
and
you
moedertje
dearest
i
kiss
you
heartily
on
both
cheeks
for
your
welcome
greeting
which
i
found
upon
my
arrival
december
today
i
feel
a
great
peace
a
whole
history
lies
behind
it
and
this
letter
must
not
go
until
i
have
told
it
to
you
guess
who
has
been
staying
here
and
who
went
away
only
this
morning
mevrouw
and
heer
bervoets
from
modjowarno
they
had
been
to
japara
to
see
my
parents
who
sent
them
here
to
us
it
was
an
inspiration
of
father
and
we
bless
the
happy
chance
which
led
those
good
angels
here
i
had
been
anxious
for
a
long
time
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
noble
couple
my
wish
has
been
granted
and
in
what
manner
i
have
always
thought
of
them
with
sympathy
but
now
deep
gratitude
is
mingled
with
the
sympathy
day
before
yesterday
my
husband
was
cheerful
and
wide
awake
the
whole
day
at
noon
the
bervoets
came
and
he
was
so
well
that
one
would
have
little
thought
that
a
few
hours
later
he
would
be
lying
desperately
much
interested
it
was
past
midnight
before
we
took
leave
of
our
guests
an
hour
later
my
husband
was
suffering
from
a
violent
indisposition
the
sickness
came
suddenly
and
in
less
than
three
minutes
it
was
so
severe
that
he
hardly
expected
to
see
the
morning
how
i
felt
you
can
easily
imagine
i
had
doctor
bervoets
called
he
had
expected
to
leave
the
next
morning
at
eight
but
neither
he
nor
his
wife
had
the
heart
to
go
away
and
leave
us
in
so
much
trouble
they
would
go
at
one
instead
but
even
then
they
saw
that
my
husband
needed
constant
medical
attention
and
our
doctor
was
away
on
a
journey
it
was
an
acute
case
of
colic
an
illness
from
which
my
husband
had
never
suffered
before
in
his
life
yesterday
at
midday
he
began
to
mend
and
fell
asleep
you
can
imagine
how
thankful
i
was
this
morning
at
eight
our
new
friends
went
away
my
husband
is
improving
steadily
and
is
only
very
weary
at
this
moment
he
is
sleeping
quietly
and
has
been
for
a
full
half
hour
god
grant
that
he
may
soon
be
entirely
well
it
is
so
strange
that
in
her
last
days
his
first
wife
should
have
thought
of
me
she
longed
to
know
me
and
to
become
friends
with
me
her
dream
was
to
go
to
japara
and
to
take
her
children
to
me
she
hardly
laid
my
portrait
out
of
her
hand
and
even
on
her
last
she
had
it
by
her
after
she
had
departed
and
her
earthly
pain
was
over
every
one
here
even
the
native
officials
have
had
but
one
wish
which
has
now
been
granted
since
the
eighth
of
november
that
is
why
there
was
such
general
rejoicing
when
we
came
my
husband
received
your
letter
with
great
pleasure
the
horse
trappings
for
east
and
west
are
ready
they
are
now
packed
and
as
soon
as
he
is
better
they
will
be
sent
he
has
also
several
kinds
of
feather
cigar
holders
and
we
are
looking
for
some
examples
of
real
lassemsche
sarongs
we
shall
then
see
what
we
can
do
further
for
east
and
west
my
husband
thinks
the
idea
of
moving
the
japara
here
excellent
he
supports
me
warmly
in
that
just
as
he
does
in
all
my
other
projects
a
handcraft
school
for
natives
has
been
one
of
his
dreams
all
along
my
husband
is
anxious
for
me
to
write
a
book
about
the
sagas
and
legends
of
java
he
would
collect
them
for
me
and
we
could
work
on
them
together
a
wonderful
prospect
there
is
so
much
that
he
wants
to
do
with
me
on
my
several
articles
from
his
hand
are
already
lying
to
mevrouw
and
abendanon
lxx
march
my
own
dearest
moedertje
i
wish
that
i
could
throw
my
arms
around
your
neck
i
long
from
my
soul
to
tell
you
of
my
great
joy
to
make
you
a
sharer
in
our
splendid
secret
a
great
sweet
happiness
awaits
me
if
gods
so
wills
it
toward
the
end
of
september
there
will
come
one
sent
from
heaven
to
make
our
beautiful
life
still
more
beautiful
to
draw
the
bond
closer
and
tighter
that
already
binds
us
together
mother
my
mother
think
of
the
little
soul
that
will
be
born
from
our
two
souls
to
call
me
mother
can
you
picture
it
i
a
mother
i
shall
make
you
old
moedertje
i
shall
make
you
a
grandmother
will
you
come
later
on
to
see
your
grandchild
i
shall
not
be
able
now
to
go
to
batavia
our
plan
was
first
to
go
on
a
journey
this
month
to
take
a
month
holiday
now
we
must
give
up
the
idea
i
am
not
able
to
travel
and
when
our
little
one
is
here
then
too
i
may
not
travel
so
i
shall
see
batavia
no
more
at
least
while
you
are
there
and
what
would
it
be
worth
to
me
without
you
and
mijnheer
my
husband
is
so
glowingly
happy
because
of
this
new
life
which
i
carry
under
my
heart
that
alone
was
wanting
to
our
happiness
lxxi
april
highly
honoured
friends
it
must
have
seemed
strange
to
you
to
have
heard
from
me
in
reply
to
your
cordial
letter
and
to
have
had
no
word
of
acknowledgment
for
the
splendid
presents
with
which
we
have
been
so
greatly
pleased
if
every
thought
sent
to
you
had
become
a
deed
what
an
array
of
letters
you
would
now
have
forgive
me
dear
friends
that
no
word
has
gone
to
you
long
before
this
the
change
from
a
simple
young
girl
to
a
bride
a
mother
and
the
wife
of
a
highly
placed
native
official
which
means
much
in
our
indian
life
is
so
great
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
at
first
but
of
how
best
to
fulfil
my
new
duties
but
that
was
not
the
only
reason
shortly
after
our
wedding
my
husband
was
taken
very
after
that
i
myself
began
to
ail
even
now
the
rembang
climate
does
not
agree
with
me
we
live
flat
by
the
sea
but
what
at
japara
was
an
advantage
is
here
at
rembang
a
plague
here
we
must
have
a
care
for
the
sea
wind
which
is
very
unwholesome
because
it
must
first
blow
over
coral
reefs
and
slime
before
it
reaches
us
but
let
me
thank
you
also
in
my
husband
name
most
gratefully
for
the
magnificent
presents
which
you
sent
to
us
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
the
interesting
painting
and
the
coloured
photograph
of
jena
hang
in
our
where
my
husband
who
is
a
great
lover
of
statues
and
pictures
keeps
his
art
treasures
i
look
at
them
so
often
with
great
pleasure
and
then
many
loving
grateful
thoughts
fly
to
my
friends
in
jena
how
charming
of
you
to
want
to
give
me
a
boomkoek
the
german
national
cake
which
no
single
festival
in
your
country
must
be
without
that
you
were
not
able
to
express
the
thought
in
deeds
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
appreciate
it
just
as
much
as
though
it
had
become
an
accomplished
fact
and
now
i
must
tell
you
about
my
new
life
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
that
will
you
not
because
you
take
such
interest
in
your
javanese
friend
and
have
been
so
concerned
about
her
future
god
be
thanked
your
fears
for
me
have
proved
groundless
a
young
wife
writes
you
these
lines
a
wife
whose
happiness
beams
in
her
eyes
and
who
can
find
no
words
adequate
to
express
it
my
husband
and
it
is
known
through
the
whole
of
java
that
i
am
different
from
others
yet
he
has
bound
himself
to
me
is
not
only
my
husband
he
is
my
best
friend
everything
that
i
think
has
been
thought
by
him
too
and
many
of
my
ideas
have
already
been
expressed
by
him
in
deeds
i
have
laid
out
for
myself
a
full
life
i
have
planned
to
be
a
pioneer
in
the
struggle
for
the
rights
and
freedom
of
the
javanese
woman
i
am
now
the
wife
of
a
man
whose
support
gives
me
strength
in
my
efforts
to
reach
the
ideal
which
is
always
before
my
eyes
i
have
now
both
personal
happiness
and
also
my
work
for
my
ideal
i
know
that
you
will
both
be
pleased
to
know
that
your
little
javanese
friend
of
the
turbulent
spirit
is
now
anchored
in
a
safe
haven
i
wish
that
you
could
see
me
in
my
new
surroundings
you
know
how
little
i
cared
for
luxury
and
worldly
position
they
would
have
no
value
in
my
eyes
were
it
not
that
it
is
my
husband
who
gives
them
to
me
but
they
are
means
by
which
i
may
reach
my
goal
more
easily
the
javanese
are
deeply
loyal
to
their
nobles
everything
that
their
chiefs
desire
is
readily
accepted
by
them
so
now
at
the
side
of
my
husband
i
shall
reach
the
hearts
of
the
people
much
more
easily
the
success
of
the
plans
for
our
school
shows
that
i
have
their
confidence
we
began
to
teach
at
home
in
japara
and
now
our
younger
sisters
are
carrying
on
the
work
there
our
little
school
now
has
one
hundred
and
twenty
pupils
daughters
of
native
chiefs
my
sisters
give
them
instructions
but
here
too
i
have
begun
our
work
my
own
little
daughters
were
my
first
pupils
so
you
see
that
the
little
javanese
are
beginning
to
realize
the
dream
of
their
girlhood
to
professor
and
anton
of
jena
lxxii
june
we
do
not
go
out
often
and
we
entertain
very
little
yet
my
life
is
always
full
splendid
i
divide
my
days
between
my
dear
husband
my
housekeeping
and
my
children
both
my
own
and
the
adopted
ones
and
these
last
take
the
largest
share
of
my
time
and
attention
when
father
is
at
work
then
the
children
work
with
me
from
nine
until
twelve
at
twelve
father
finds
a
troop
of
but
very
hungry
children
at
one
the
little
ones
are
sent
to
bed
and
if
father
is
in
bed
and
i
am
not
too
tired
i
work
with
the
young
girls
at
four
i
preside
at
the
when
the
little
ones
have
drunk
their
milk
and
have
bathed
they
can
drive
the
fowls
to
the
coops
or
walk
with
us
or
play
in
the
garden
we
amuse
ourselves
for
a
little
and
prattle
about
everything
or
about
nothing
when
our
little
troop
comes
in
then
we
are
done
with
play
father
sits
down
to
read
the
paper
and
they
range
themselves
around
mother
i
sit
in
a
with
the
two
smallest
on
my
lap
a
child
on
each
arm
of
the
chair
and
the
two
eldest
at
my
knee
we
tell
stories
soon
afterward
comes
around
we
eat
early
with
the
little
ones
the
smallest
of
all
sits
next
to
mother
the
little
fellow
has
taken
upon
himself
the
task
of
lifting
the
glass
cover
for
mother
no
one
must
take
that
little
work
away
from
him
and
if
he
is
not
allowed
to
do
it
he
knows
it
is
because
he
has
deserved
a
punishment
at
eight
the
little
treasures
are
sent
to
bed
and
we
parents
sit
up
and
talk
to
each
other
till
klaas
vaak
drives
us
to
the
poeloe
kapok
and
this
is
not
so
late
as
at
japara
for
we
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
sunday
is
a
holiday
for
both
of
us
we
begin
it
always
with
a
walk
after
that
i
teach
my
girls
cooking
and
then
the
mother
and
wife
can
do
the
things
for
which
she
has
not
had
time
during
the
week
it
is
not
much
that
she
can
do
for
my
husband
is
happier
when
i
sit
by
him
he
charms
me
sometimes
with
beautiful
gamelan
music
and
songs
i
think
it
is
delightful
in
my
husband
to
add
the
songs
for
the
gamelan
music
alone
makes
too
great
an
impression
upon
me
it
takes
me
back
to
times
of
which
i
must
not
think
it
makes
me
weak
and
sad
so
the
days
fly
by
calm
quiet
and
peaceful
as
a
little
brook
deep
in
the
forest
if
the
child
that
i
carry
under
my
heart
is
a
girl
what
shall
i
wish
for
her
i
shall
wish
that
she
may
live
a
rich
full
life
and
that
she
may
complete
the
work
that
her
mother
has
begun
she
shall
never
be
compelled
to
do
anything
abhorrent
to
her
deepest
feelings
what
she
does
must
be
of
her
own
free
will
she
shall
have
a
mother
who
will
watch
over
the
welfare
of
her
inmost
being
and
a
father
who
will
never
force
her
in
anything
it
will
make
no
difference
to
him
if
his
daughter
remains
unmarried
her
whole
life
long
what
will
count
with
him
will
be
that
she
shall
always
keep
her
esteem
and
affection
for
us
he
has
shown
that
he
respects
women
and
that
we
are
one
in
thought
by
his
desire
to
trust
his
daughter
wholly
to
me
oh
if
you
only
knew
the
things
that
slander
has
spread
abroad
about
me
what
i
heard
before
my
marriage
was
praise
compared
to
what
i
have
since
learned
my
husband
must
indeed
have
had
courage
to
offer
me
his
heart
his
hand
and
his
name
he
had
heard
many
things
concerning
me
but
never
a
single
word
of
praise
still
in
his
heart
there
was
a
conviction
which
nothing
could
shake
that
we
were
the
bearers
of
new
ideas
which
were
incomprehensible
to
the
great
multitude
who
scorned
us
because
they
could
not
understand
when
his
first
wife
was
still
living
he
would
always
take
my
part
when
they
dragged
my
name
through
the
mud
she
had
been
so
anxious
to
know
me
and
during
her
last
illness
she
slept
with
my
portrait
in
her
hand
and
he
had
a
premonition
that
some
day
i
should
play
an
important
rôle
in
his
life
every
one
here
in
the
house
had
been
interested
in
me
so
there
are
premonitions
secret
longings
that
come
often
as
forerunners
of
what
will
happen
in
the
future
only
i
alone
did
not
think
did
not
dream
that
this
would
be
my
future
existence
i
am
not
giving
my
little
ones
any
vacation
they
will
have
one
in
september
when
my
child
is
born
for
the
first
fortnight

must
rest
and
then
my
baby
will
go
into
the
schoolroom

have
already
prepared
a
corner
where

while

when
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
write
to
you
as

yore

all
sides

reproaches
that

write
so
seldom
but
i
can
not
do
anything
else
i
have
undertaken
a
great
task
and
it
is
my
hard
duty

lxxiv
july
my
own
dearest
moedertje
my
love
for
you
and
my
interest
in
everything
that
concerns
you
must
not
be
measured
according
to
the
number
of
my
letters
to
you
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
write
to
any
one
at
all
now
especially
when
i
am
struggling
against
bad
health
i
have
been
quite
sick
i
caught
a
cold
and
suffered
severely
that
is
now
past
thank
god
but
i
still
have
to
take
care
of
myself
and
i
must
i
will
be
well
for
our
child
sake
how
much
a
child
costs
its
mother
all
the
tedious
suffering
is
still
to
come
oh
moeska
i
must
take
care
of
myself
and
be
prudent
in
everything
for
a
month
past
i
have
only
received
members
of
the
family
who
can
come
into
my
room
i
write
this
in
a
long
chair
i
can
not
sit
up
straight
comfortably
mamma
was
with
me
last
week
the
dear
one
nothing
is
too
much
for
her
where
the
welfare
of
her
children
is
at
stake
just
so
she
went
to
pamalang
when
kardinah
was
sick
and
just
so
she
came
all
the
way
here
when
my
husband
in
his
distress
telegraphed
for
her
my
husband
is
looking
forward
to
the
approaching
time
with
great
apprehension
he
can
not
bear
to
see
me
suffer
poor
dear
one
he
really
suffered
more
than
i
when
i
was
so
sick
he
would
turn
the
whole
world
upside
down
to
spare
me
suffering
and
pain
lxxv
august
moeska
dearest
i
think
of
you
so
much
above
all
do
i
think
of
you
now
always
with
a
feeling
of
tenderness
but
at
the
same
time
a
deep
sadness
sadness
because
you
are
so
far
from
me
and
will
be
even
further
removed
beyond
my
reach
why
must
it
be
that
just
those
souls
that
are
most
closely
akin
should
be
separated
so
far
from
one
another
i
am
so
unhappy
when
i
let
myself
long
for
you
i
sit
still
looking
straight
ahead
neither
hearing
nor
seeing
what
is
happening
around
me
i
live
in
the
past
that
sweet
and
that
bitter
past
when
i
was
so
eager
for
suffering
and
where
your
love
is
interwoven
always
like
a
garland
of
light
i
suffered
and
i
rejoiced
my
heart
is
full
of
sadness
but
also
of
gratitude
for
the
happiness
which
your
love
has
brought
me
i
never
cease
to
thank
god
for
having
brought
you
to
us
why
is
it
that
the
javanese
is
so
poor
they
ask
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
thinking
how
they
will
be
able
to
get
more
money
out
of
him
who
will
that
money
come
from
naturally
from
the
little
man
for
whose
woe
and
weal
we
express
such
extreme
concern
that
a
whole
commission
is
named
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
retrogression
what
makes
the
javanese
so
poor
when
who
earn
or
cents
a
day
are
made
to
pay
a
trade
tax
every
time
a
goat
or
a
sheep
is
butchered
a
tax
of
twenty
cents
is
paid
a
satee
who
butchers
two
every
day
must
pay
this
tax
which
amounts
to
one
hundred
and
florins
in
the
course
of
a
year
what
is
left
for
his
profit
barely
enough
to
live
on
i
learned
much
of
this
at
my
parents
house
but
here
where
my
husband
shares
every
thought
with
me
where
i
share
his
whole
life
his
work
and
his
troubles
i
have
come
to
know
of
conditions
of
which
i
was
not
only
in
ignorance
but
the
very
existence
of
which
i
did
not
dream
there
is
so
much
crying
injustice
and
he
who
loves
righteousness
and
holds
office
must
suffer
indeed
he
must
see
much
and
do
much
himself
that
is
against
all
principles
of
right
moeska
perhaps
this
will
be
my
last
letter
to
you
think
sometimes
of
your
daughter
who
loves
you
and
your
husband
so
dearly
and
who
presses
you
now
to
her
heart
to
mevrouw
abendanon
satee
is
a
dish
composed
of
meat
strung
on
a
stick
and
roasted
lxxvi
august
dearest
moedertje
mine
after
all
that
was
not
to
be
my
last
letter
i
have
been
afraid
but
perhaps
it
will
be
for
the
best
that
my
time
is
coming
quickly
i
feel
it
moedertje
it
is
very
probable
that
your
grandchild
will
be
born
sooner
than
we
first
expected
him
greetings
my
dear
one
think
well
of
me
both
of
you
in
my
heart
there
is
a
prayer
which
says
god
keep
my
dear
friends
your
own
little
daughter
kartini
lxxvii
september
my
dearest
moedertje
how
can
i
thank
you
for
the
precious
little
frock
that
you
have
given
our
baby
it
has
all
the
more
worth
in
our
eyes
because
we
know
under
what
circumstances
you
have
worked
this
present
for
your
little
grandchild
we
heard
through
roekmini
that
you
made
it
yourself
after
your
return
to
batavia
to
think
that
you
who
were
indisposed
yourself
and
had
so
many
cares
upon
your
shoulders
as
always
but
especially
at
that
time
when
you
were
under
great
pressure
could
still
take
such
delicate
and
patient
stitches
for
our
child
your
friendship
must
indeed
be
great
and
your
love
for
me
deep
and
sincere
i
looked
at
the
little
frock
yesterday
with
wet
eyes
and
a
grateful
happy
heart
and
often
i
feel
i
must
look
at
it
again
it
tells
me
so
much
moedertje
dearest
it
has
made
your
daughter
so
happy
later
your
little
grandchild
can
wear
the
figured
ornament
around
his
neck
when
the
dress
grows
too
small
for
him
i
shall
keep
it
for
him
till
he
can
understand
me
when
i
tell
him
of
the
great
love
which
god
has
given
to
his
mother
so
that
the
little
ornament
will
be
even
more
precious
to
him
than
it
is
now
to
me
my
husband
said
to
me
yesterday
when
we
received
your
present
go
wife
and
write
to
moedertje
right
away
or
it
may
be
too
late
and
i
have
followed
his
advice
and
at
the
same
time
the
voice
of
my
own
heart
our
little
one
is
not
here
yet
but
it
may
be
any
moment
now
i
feel
that
his
coming
is
very
near
thank
you
so
much
for
your
encouraging
words
dear
the
thought
that
far
from
here
there
is
one
a
part
of
my
soul
who
hopes
and
prays
for
me
makes
me
strong
and
does
me
unutterable
good
people
who
have
seen
me
during
these
last
days
think
me
unusually
cheerful
and
why
should
i
not
be
cheerful
when
such
great
happiness
awaits
me
what
matter
all
the
hours
of
pain
when
they
are
the
price
of
such
sweet
happiness
i
long
so
for
my
little
treasure
and
it
is
sweet
to
know
that
many
whom
i
love
are
with
me
in
thought
in
these
last
days
do
i
not
know
how
at
my
dear
home
hour
by
hour
they
think
of
me
hope
and
pray
for
me
when
so
many
hearts
pray
the
same
prayer
heaven
will
not
be
deaf
to
it
moeske
i
am
so
firmly
convinced
that
all
will
go
well
with
your
daughter
naturally
you
will
be
notified
at
once
as
soon
as
the
great
event
has
taken
place
oh
if
you
my
good
angel
could
but
stand
at
the
cradle
of
my
child
how
blissfully
happy
i
should
be
i
know
that
you
will
love
our
child
even
though
it
should
grow
into
a
greater
simpleton
than
its
mother
if
it
is
only
not
too
sensitive
all
will
be
well
he
moeske
and
that
will
not
be
unless
the
evil
spirits
watch
by
its
cradle
but
your
talisman
will
take
care
of
that
and
protect
your
little
one
from
evil
spirits
my
mother
has
been
with
me
for
two
weeks
and
there
is
also
an
old
grandmother
who
has
come
to
be
with
me
during
the
hard
hours
that
are
coming
i
am
waited
upon
spoiled
and
watched
over
like
a
princess
the
layette
and
the
little
bed
are
in
our
room
all
ready
for
the
coining
of
our
treasure
and

little
grandmother

best
of
health
when

reaches
you
how

in
china

read
his
article
in
magazine
with
much
interest
what
does
the
youth
write
ask
brother
edie
if
he
still
remembers
me
i
have
always
regretted
so
much
that
i
have
never
met
him
personally
and
now
the
chances
of
that
have
gone
by
for
ever
when
you
write
to
him
give
him
a
cordial
greeting
from
sister
kartini
tell
him
of
my
great
happiness
and
that
my
husband
and
i
both
think
of
him
with
sympathy
how
delightful
is
the
odour
of
the
little
fruit
which
is
our
true
native
perfume
i
have
put
it
away
with
the
baby
frock
in
a
chest
with
other
garments
so
that
they
will
be
perfumed
delicately
my
treasure
must
smell
sweet
dearest
moedertje
accept
again
sincere
thanks
from
us
both
greet
mijnheer
heartily
for
us
and
feel
yourself
softly
kissed
by
your
own
little
daughter
kartini
this
was
her
last
letter
on
the
of
september
her
son
was
born
and
four
days
later
she
died
suddenly
being
just
years
old
she
was
deeply
mourned
by
all
who
had
known
and
loved
her
