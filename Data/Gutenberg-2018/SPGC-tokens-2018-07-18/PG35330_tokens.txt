enter

and
with
him
revenge
ghost
when
this
eternal
substance
of
my
soul
did
live
imprison
in
my
wanton
flesh
each
in
their
function
serving
others
need
i
was
a
courtier
in
the
spanish
court
my
name
was
don
andrea
my
descent
though
not
ignoble
yet
inferior
far
to
gracious
fortunes
of
my
tender
youth
for
there
in
prime
and
pride
of
all
my
years
by
duteous
service
and
deserving
love
in
secret
i
possess
a
worthy
dame
which
hight
sweet
by
name
but
in
the
harvest
of
my
summer
joys
death
winter
nipped
the
blossoms
of
my
bliss
forcing
divorce
betwixt
my
love
and
me
for
in
the
late
conflict
with
portingal
my
valour
drew
me
into
danger
mouth
till
life
to
death
made
passage
through
my
wounds
when
i
was
slain
my
soul
descended
straight
to
pass
the
flowing
stream
of
acheron
but
churlish
charon
only
boatman
there
said
that
my
rites
of
burial
not
perform
i
might
not
sit
amongst
his
passengers
ere
sol
had
slept
three
nights
in
thetis
lap
and
slak
his
smoking
chariot
in
her
flood
by
don
horatio
our
son
my
funerals
and
obsequies
were
done
then
was
the
ferryman
of
hell
content
to
pass
me
over
to
the
slimy
strand
that
leads
to
fell
avernus
ugly
waves
there
pleasing
cerberus
with
honeyed
speech
i
passed
the
perils
of
the
foremost
porch
not
far
from
hence
amidst
ten
thousand
souls
sat
minos
eacus
and
rhadamant
to
whom
no
sooner
i
make
approach
to
crave
a
passport
for
my
wandering
ghost
but
minos
in
graven
leaves
of
lottery
drew
forth
the
manner
of
my
life
and
death
this
knight
quoth
he
both
liv
and
died
in
love
and
for
his
love
tried
fortune
of
the
wars
and
by
war
fortune
lost
both
love
and
life
why
then
said
eacus
convey
him
hence
to
walk
with
lovers
in
our
field
of
love
and
the
course
of
everlasting
time
under
green
and
cypress
shades
no
no
said
rhadamant
it
were
not
well
with
loving
souls
to
place
a
martialist
he
died
in
war
and
must
to
martial
fields
where
wounded
hector
lives
in
lasting
pain
and
achilles
myrmidons
do
scour
the
plain
then
minos
mildest
censor
of
the
three
made
this
device
to
end
the
difference
send
him
quoth
he
to
our
infernal
king
to
doom
him
as
best
seems
his
majesty
to
this
effect
my
passport
straight
was
drawn
in
keeping
on
my
way
to
pluto
court
through
dreadful
shades
of
night
i
saw
more
sights
than
thousand
tongues
can
tell
or
pens
can
write
or
mortal
hearts
can
think
three
ways
there
were
that
on
the
right
hand
side
was
ready
way
unto
the
fields
where
lovers
live
and
bloody
martialists
but
either
sort
contain
within
his
bounds
the
left
hand
path
declining
fearfully
was
ready
downfall
to
the
deepest
hell
where
bloody
furies
shake
their
whips
of
steel
and
poor
ixion
turns
an
endless
wheel
where
usurers
are
chok
with
melting
gold
and
wantons
are
embrac
with
ugly
snakes
and
murderers
groan
with
wounds
and
perjur
wights
scalded
in
boiling
lead
and
all
foul
sins
with
torments
overwhelm
these
two
ways
i
trod
the
middle
path
which
brought
me
to
the
fair
elysian
green
in
midst
whereof
there
stands
a
stately
tower

me

thee
in

chivalry
where

do
jointly
knit
their

leaning
on

our
armies

full

menacing

cheerly
sounding
trumpets
drums
and
fifes
both
raising
dreadful
clamors
to
the
sky
that
valleys
hills
and
rivers
made
rebound
and
itself
was
frighted
with
the
sound
our
battles
both
were

corner
strongly
fenc
with
wings
of
shot

ere

a
squadron
of

readiest
shot
from

the

punch
his
horse
and
ding
him
to

ground
then
young
don
balthazar
with
ruthless
rage
taking
advantage
of
his
foe
distress
did
finish
what
his

begun

too
late
incens
with
just

laid
him
down
and
dew
him
with

pleasure
more
in
kindness
than
in

sad
is
our
king
and
portingal
laments
supposing
that
don
balthazar
is
slain
bal
aside
so
am
i
slain
by
beauty
tyranny
you
see
my
lord
how
balthazar
is
slain
i
frolic
with
the
duke
of
castille
son
wrapp
every
hour
in
pleasures
of
the
court
and
grac
with
favours
of
his
majesty
king
put
off
your
greetings
till
our
feast
be
done
now
come
and
sit
with
us
and
taste
our
cheer
sit
to
the
banquet
sit
down
young
prince
you
are
our
second
guest
brother
sit
down
and
nephew
take
your
place
signior
horatio
wait
thou
upon
our
cup
for
well
thou
hast
deserved
to
be
honour
now
lordings
fall
too
spain
is
portugal
and
portugal
is
spain
we
both
are
friends
tribute
is
paid
and
we
enjoy
our
right
but
where
is
old
hieronimo
our
marshall
he
promis
us
in
honour
of
our
guest
to
grace
our
banquet
with
some
pompous
jest
enter
hieronimo
with
a
drum
three
knights
each
with
scutcheon
then
he
fetches
three
kings
they
take
their
crowns
and
them
captive
hieronimo
this
makes
content
mine
eye
although
i
sound
not
well
the
mystery
hiero
the
first
arm
knight
that
hung
his
scutcheon
up
he
takes
the
scutcheon
and
gives
it
to
the
king
was
english
robert
earle
of
gloucester
who
when
king
stephen
bore
sway
in
albion
arriv
with
five
and
twenty
thousand
men
in
portingal
and
by
success
of
war
enforc
the
king
then
but
a
saracen
to
bear
the
yoke
of
the
english
monarchy
king
my
lord
of
portingal
by
this
you
see
that
which
may
comfort
both
your
king
and
you
and
make
your
late
discomfort
seem
the
less
but
say
hieronimo
what
was
the
next
hiero
the
second
knight
that
hung
his
scutcheon
up
he
doth
as
he
did
before
was
edmond
earle
of
kent
in
albion
when
english
richard
wore
the
diadem
he
came
likewise
and
razed
lisbon
walls
and
took
the
king
of
portingal
in
fight
for
which
and
other
such
service
done
he
after
was
created
duke
of
york
king
this
is
another
special
argument
that
portingal
may
deign
to
bear
our
yoke
when
it
by
little
england
hath
been
yok
but
now
hieronimo
what
were
the
last
hiero
the
third
and
last
not
least
in
our
account
doing
as
before
was
as
the
rest
a
valiant
englishman
brave
john
of
gaunt
the
duke
of
lancaster
as
by
his
scutcheon
plainly
may
appear
he
with
a
puissant
army
came
to
spain
and
took
our
king
of
castille
prisoner
ambass
this
is
an
argument
for
our
viceroy
that
spain
may
not
insult
for
her
success
since
english
warriors
likewise
conquer
spain
and
made
them
bow
their
knees
to
albion
king
hieronimo
i
drink
to
thee
for
this
device
which
hath
pleas
both
the
ambassador
and
me
pledge
me
hieronimo
if
thou
love
the
king
takes
the
cup
of
horatio
my
lord
i
fear
we
sit
but
unless
our
dainties
were
more
delicate
but
welcome
are
you
to
the

my

hath
forbidden

by
my
troth
is
likely
if
he
had
not
warned
me
i
should
not
have
had
so
much
idle
time
for
we
in

are

by

honesty
here
nothing

the
bare
empty

were
it
not

his

would
have
sworn
it
had
i
not
seen
the
contrary

can
not
choose
but
smile
to
think
how
the
villain
will
flout
the
gallows
scorn
the
audience

descant
on
the
hangman

all
presuming

not
be
an
odd
jest
for
me
to
stand
and
grace
every
jest
he
makes
pointing
my
finger
at
this
box
as
who
should
say
mock
on
here
thy
warrant
not
a
scurvy
jest
that
a
man
should
jest
himself
to
death
alas
poor
pedringano
i
am
in

sorry
for
thee

reported
too
that
thou
lorenzo
hieronimo
and
in
his
suits
toward
his
majesty
still
him
back
and
to
cross
his
suit
lor
that
i
my

cas
i
tell
thee

have
heard
it
said
when
to

sorrow
i
have
been
to
answer
for
thee
though
thou
art
my
son
lorenzo
thou
not
the
common
love
and
kindness
that

hath
won
by
his
deserts

to
procure
his
health
lorenzo
thou
thwart
his
passions

he
exclaim
against
thee

the

honour
in

a
scandal
among
the
kings
to
hear
hieronimo
exclaim
on

tell
me
and
look
thou
tell
me
truly
too
whence
grows
the
ground
of
this
report
in

lor
my
lord
it
lies
not
in
lorenzo
power
to
stop
the
vulgar
liberal
of
their
tongues
a
small
advantage
makes
a
and
no
man
lives
that
long
contenteth
all

have
seen
thee
busy
to
keep
back
him
and
his
supplications
from
the

lor
yourself
my
lord
hath
seen
his
passions
that
ill
beseem
the
presence
of
a
king
and
for
i
pitied
him
in
his
distress
i
held
him
thence
with
kind
and
courteous
words
as
free
from
malice
to
hieronimo
as
to
my
soul
my
lord
cas
hieronimo
my

mistakes
thee
then
lor
my
gracious

to
think
upon
the
murder
of
his
son
alas
how
easy
is
it
for
him
to
err
but
for
his
satisfaction
and
the
world
good
my
lord
that
hieronimo
and
i
were
reconcil
if

assures
thee

to
after

monstrous
fathers

soon
the
death

have
tender
so
thus
careless
should
be
lost

in

to
thee
so
lov
his

as
still
i
wish
their
deaths
nor
shall
his
death
be
unreveng
by

although
i
bear
it
out
for
fashion
sake
for
here
i
swear
in

of

earth
shouldst
thou
neglect
the
love
thou
shouldst
retain
and
give
it
over
and
devise
no
more
myself
should
send
their
hateful
souls
to

wrought
his
downfall
with
extremest
death
hie
but
may
it
be
that
vows
such
revenge
as
she
hath
deign
to

why
then
i

our
drift

all
the
saints
do
sit
soliciting
for

on
those
cursed
murtherers
madame

my
fear
and
care
in
not
believing

i
thoughtless
think
upon
a
mean
to

be
unreveng
at
full
and
here
i
vow
so
you
but
give
consent
and
will
conceal
my
resolution
i
will
ere

hath
my
heart
but
you

lord
have
hers
lor
but
now
hieronimo
or
never
we
are
to
entreat
your
help
hie
my
help
why
my
good
lords
assure
yourselves
of
me
for
you
have
me
cause
aye
by
my
faith
have
you
bal
it
pleased
you
at
the
entertainment
of
the
ambassador
to
grace
the
king
so
much
as
with
a
show
now
were
your
study
so
well
furnished
as
for
the
passing
of
the
first
night
sport
to
entertain
my
father
with
the
like
or
any
such
like
pleasing
motion
assure
yourself
it
would
content
them
well
hiero
is
this
all
bal
aye
this
is
all
hiero
why
then
i
fit
you
say
no
more
when
i
was
young
i
gave
my
mind
and
plied
myself
to
fruitless
poetry
which
though
it
profit
the
professor
naught
yet
is
it
passing
pleasing
to
the
world
lor
and
how
for
that
hiero
marry
my
good
lord
and
yet
me
thinks
you
are
too
quick
with
us
when
in
toledo

i
studied

was
my
chance
to
write
a
tragedy
see
here
my
lords
he
shows
them
a
book
which
long
forgot
i
found
this
other
day

would
your
lordships
favour

so
much
as
but
to
grace
me
with
your
acting
it
i
mean
each
one
of
you
to
play
a
part
assure
you
it
will
prove
most
passing
strange
and
wondrous
plausible
to
that
assembly
bal
what
would
you
have
us
play
a
tragedy
hiero
why
nero
thought
it
no
disparagement
and
kings
and
emperors
have
delight
to
make
experience
of
their
wit
in
plays
lor
nay
be
not
angry
good
hieronimo
the
prince
but
ask
a
question
bal
in
faith
hieronimo
and
you
be
in
earnest
i
make
one
lor
and
i
another
hiero
now
my
good
lord
could
you
entreat
your
sister
to
make
one
for
what
a
play
without
a
woman
in
it
bel
little
entreaty
shall
serve
me
hieronimo
for
i
must
needs
be
employed
in
your
play
hiero
why
this
is
well
i
tell
you
lordings
it
was
determined
to
have
been
acted
by
gentlemen
and
scholars
too
such
as
could
tell
what
to
speak
bal
and
now
it
shall
be
play
by
princes
and
courtiers
such
as
can
tell
how
to
speak
if
as
it
is
our
country
manner
you
will
but
let
us
know
the
argument
hiero
that
shall
i
roundly
the
chronicles
of
spain
record
this
written
of
a
knight
of
rhodes
he
was
betroth
and
wedded
at
the
length
to
one
perseda
an
italian
dame
whose
beauty
ravish
all
that
her
beheld
especially
the
soul
of
suleiman
who
at
the
marriage
was
the
chiefest
guest
by
sundry
means
sought
suleiman
to
win
perseda
love
and
could
not
gain
the
same
then
he
break
his
passions
to
a
friend
one
of
his
bashaws
whom
he
held
full
dear
her
has
this
bashaw
long
solicited
and
saw
she
was
not
otherwise
to
be
won
but
by
her
husband
death
this
knight
of
rhodes
whom
presently
by
treachery
he
slew
she
stirr
with
an
exceeding
hate
therefore
as
cause
of
this
slew
sultan
suleiman
and
to
escape
the
bashaw
tyranny
did
stab
herself
and
this
is
the
tragedy
lor
o
excellent
bel
but
say
hieronimo
what
then
became
of
him
that
was
the
bashaw
hiero
marry
thus
moved
with
remorse
of
his
misdeeds
ran
to
a
mountain
top
and
hung
himself
bal
but
which
of
us
is
to
perform
that
part
hiero
o
that
will
i
my
lords
make
no
doubt
of
it
i
play
the
murderer
i
warrant
you
for
i
already
have
conceited
that
bal
and
what
shall
i
hiero
great
suleiman
the
turkish
emperor
lor
and
i
hiero
erastus
the
knight
of
rhodes
bel
and
i
hiero
perseda
chaste
and
resolute
and
here
my
lords
are
several
abstracts
drawn
for
each
of
you
to
note
your
several
parts
and
act
it
as
occasion
offer
you
you
must
provide
you
with
a
turkish
cap
a
black
moustache
and
a
fauchion
gives
paper
to
balthazar
you
with
a
cross
like
a
knight
of
rhodes
gives
another
to
lorenzo
and
madame
you
must
then
attire
yourself
he
giveth
another
like
phoebe
flora
or
the
huntress
dian
which
to
your
discretion
shall
seem
best
and
as
for
me
my
lords
i
look
to
one
and
with
the
ransom
that
the
viceroy
sent
so
furnish
and
perform
this
tragedy
as
all
the
world
shall
say
hieronimo
was
liberal
in
gracing
of
it
so
bal
hieronimo
methinks
a
comedy
were
better
hiero
a
comedy
fie
comedies
are
fit
for
common
wits
but
to
present
a
kingly
troupe
withal
give
me
a
tragedy
tragedia
cothurnata
fitting
kings
containing
matter
and
not
common
things
my
lords
all
this
our
sport
must
be
perform
as
fitting
for
the
first
night
revelling
the
italian
tragedians
were
so
sharp
of
wit
that
in
one
hour
meditation
they
would
perform
in
action
lor
and
well
it
may
for
i
have
seen
the
like
in
paris
the
french
tragedians
hiero
in
paris
mass
and
well
remembered
there
one
thing
more
that
rests
for
us
to
do
bal
what
that
hieronimo
forget
not
anything
hiero
each
one
of
us
must
act
his
part
in
unknown
languages
that
it
may
breed
the
more
variety
as
you
my
lord
in
latin
i
in
greek
you
in
italian
and
i
know
that
hath
practised
the
french
in
courtly
french
shall
all
her
phrases
be
bel
you
mean
to
try
my
cunning
then
hieronimo
bal
but
this
will
be
a
mere
confusion
and
hardly
shall
we
all
be
understood
heiro
it
must
be
so
for
the
conclusion
shall
prove
the
invention
and
all
was
good
and
i
myself
in
an
oration
that
i
will
have
there
behind
a
curtain
and
with
a
strange
and
wondrous
show
besides
assure
yourself
shall
make
the
matter
known
and
all
shall
be
concluded
in
one
scene
for
there
no
pleasure
in
tediousness
bal
to
lor
how
like
you
this
lor
why
thus
my
lord
we
must
resolve
to
soothe
his
humors
up
bal
on
then
hieronimo
farewell
till
soon
hiero
you
ply

gear
lor
i
warrant

less
then
in

methinks
i
hear
his
dismal
echo
in
the
air
with
soonest
speed
i
hasted
to
the
noise
where
hanging
on
a

i
found
my

with
wounds

slaughter
as
you

i
think
you
at
this
spectacle
speak
portuguese
whose

mine
if
thou
canst
weep
upon
thy
balthazar

i
wail
for
my
horatio
and
you
my

me
for
a
brainsick
lunacy

hieronimo
how
can
you
brook
our

river
of
his
bleeding
wounds

as
propitious

my
bloody
heart
soliciting
remembrance
of
my
vow
with
these
o
these
accursed
murderers
which
now
perform
my
heart
is
satisfied
and
to
this
end
the
bashaw
i
became
that
might
revenge
me
on
lorenzo
life
who
therefore
was
appointed
to
the
part
and
was
to
represent
the
knight
of
rhodes
that
i
might
kill
him
more
conveniently
so
viceroy

this
balthazar
thy
son

that
tragic
part

part
in
this
for
though
the
story
saith
she
should
have
died
yet
i
of
kindness
and
of
care
for
her
did
otherwise
determine
of
her
end
but
love
of
him
whom
they
did
hate
too
much
did
urge
her
resolution
to
be
such
and
princes
now
behold
hieronimo
author
and
actor
in
this
tragedy
bearing
his
latest
fortune
