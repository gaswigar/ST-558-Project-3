smith
is
one
of
the
great
adventurers
of
science
fiction
one
of
that
group
of
cool
men
who
roam
the
spaceways
and
provide
much
of
the
inspiration
for
the
legends
that
are
a
part
of
the
folklore
of
space
here
is
northwest
smith
in
a
rare
moment
of
peace
in
a
remarkable
vignette
published
here
by
permission
of
the
song
in
a
minor
key
he
had
been
promising
himself
this
moment
for
how
many
lonely
months
and
years
on
alien
worlds
beneath
him
the
clovered
was
warm
in
the
sun
northwest
smith
moved
his
shoulders
against
the
earth
and
closed
his
eyes
breathing
so
deeply
that
the
gun
holstered
upon
his
chest
drew
tight
against
its
strap
as
he
drank
the
fragrance
of
earth
and
clover
warm
in
the
sun
here
in
the
hollow
of
the
hills
pillowed
upon
clover
and
the
lap
of
earth
he
let
his
breath
run
out
in
a
long
sigh
and
drew
one
palm
across
the
grass
in
a
caress
like
a
lover
he
had
been
promising
himself
this
moment
for
how
long
how
many
months
and
years
on
alien
worlds
he
would
not
think
of
it
now
he
would
not
remember
the
dark
spaceways
or
the
red
slag
of
martian
drylands
or
the
days
on
venus
when
he
had
dreamed
of
the
earth
that
had
outlawed
him
so
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
and
the
sunlight
drenching
him
through
no
sound
in
his
ears
but
the
passage
of
a
breeze
through
the
grass
and
a
creaking
of
some
insect
nearby
the
violent
years
behind
him
might
never
have
been
except
for
the
gun
pressed
into
his
ribs
between
his
chest
and
the
clovered
earth
he
might
be
a
boy
again
years
upon
years
ago
long
before
he
had
broken
his
first
law
or
killed
his
first
man
no
one
else
alive
now
knew
who
that
boy
had
been
not
even
the
all
knowing
patrol
not
even
venusian
yarol
who
had
been
his
closest
friend
for
so
many
riotous
years
no
one
would
ever
know
now
not
his
name
which
had
not
always
been
smith
or
his
native
land
or
the
home
that
had
bred
him
or
the
first
violent
deed
that
had
sent
him
down
the
devious
paths
which
led
here
here
to
the
clover
hollow
in
the
hills
of
an
earth
that
had
forbidden
him
ever
to
set
foot
again
upon
her
soil
he
unclasped
the
hands
behind
his
head
and
rolled
over
to
lay
a
scarred
cheek
on
his
arm
smiling
to
himself
well
here
was
earth
beneath
him
no
longer
a
green
star
high
in
alien
skies
but
warm
soil
new
clover
so
near
his
face
he
could
see
all
the
little
stems
and
trefoil
leaves
moist
earth
granular
at
their
roots
an
ant
ran
by
with
waving
antennae
close
beside
his
cheek
he
closed
his
eyes
and
drew
another
deep
breath
better
not
even
look
better
to
lie
here
like
an
animal
absorbing
the
sun
and
the
feel
of
earth
blindly
wordlessly
now
he
was
not
northwest
smith
scarred
outlaw
of
the
spaceways
now
he
was
a
boy
again
with
all
his
life
before
him
there
would
be
a
house
just
over
the
hill
with
shaded
porches
and
white
curtains
blowing
in
the
breeze
and
the
sound
of
sweet
familiar
voices
indoors
there
would
be
a
girl
with
hair
like
poured
honey
hesitating
just
inside
the
door
lifting
her
eyes
to
him
tears
in
the
eyes
he
lay
very
still
remembering
curious
how
vividly
it
all
came
back
though
the
house
had
been
ashes
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
the
girl
the
girl
he
rolled
over
violently
opening
his
eyes
no
use
remembering
her
there
had
been
that
fatal
flaw
in
him
from
the
very
first
he
knew
now
if
he
were
the
boy
again
knowing
all
he
knew
today
still
the
flaw
would
be
there
and
sooner
or
later
the
same
thing
must
have
happened
that
had
happened
twenty
years
ago
he
had
been
born
for
a
wilder
age
when
men
took
what
they
wanted
and
held
what
they
could
without
respect
for
law
obedience
was
not
in
him
and
so
as
vividly
as
on
that
day
it
happened
he
felt
the
same
old
surge
of
anger
and
despair
twenty
years
old
now
felt
the
bucking
hard
against
his
unaccustomed
fist
heard
the
hiss
of
its
deadly
charge
ravening
into
a
face
he
hated
he
could
not
be
sorry
even
now
for
that
first
man
he
had
killed
but
in
the
smoke
of
that
killing
had
gone
up
the
columned
house
and
the
future
he
might
have
had
the
boy
himself
lost
as
atlantis
now
and
the
girl
with
the
hair
and
much
much
else
besides
it
had
to
happen
he
knew
he
being
the
boy
he
was
it
had
to
happen
even
if
he
could
go
back
and
start
all
over
the
tale
would
be
the
same
and
it
was
all
long
past
now
anyhow
and
nobody
remembered
any
more
at
all
except
himself
a
man
would
be
a
fool
to
lie
here
thinking
about
it
any
longer
smith
grunted
and
sat
up
shrugging
the
gun
into
place
against
his
ribs
