emmy
lou
laboriously
copying
digits
looked
up
the
boy
sitting
in
line
in
the
next
row
of
desks
was
making
signs
to
her
she
had
noticed
the
little
boy
before
he
was
a
square
little
boy
with
a
sprinkling
of
freckles
over
the
bridge
of
the
nose
and
a
cheerful
breadth
of
nostril
his
teeth
were
wide
apart
and
his
smile
was
broad
and
constant
not
that
emmy
lou
could
have
told
all
this
she
only
knew
that
to
her
the
knowledge
of
the
little
boy
concerning
the
things
peculiar
to
the
primer
world
seemed
limitless
and
now
the
little
boy
was
beckoning
emmy
lou
she
did
not
know
him
but
neither
did
she
know
any
of
the
seventy
other
little
boys
and
girls
making
the
primer
class
because
of
a
popular
prejudice
against
emmy
lou
had
not
entered
the
primer
class
until
late
when
she
arrived
the
seventy
little
boys
and
girls
were
well
along
in
alphabetical
lore
having
long
since
passed
the
a
b
c
of
initiation
and
become
glibly
eloquent
to
a
point
where
the
l
m
n
o
p
slipped
off
their
tongues
with
the
liquid
ease
of
repetition
and
familiarity
but
emmy
lou
can
catch
up
said
emmy
lou
aunt
cordelia
a
plump
and
cheery
lady
beaming
with
optimistic
placidity
upon
the
infant
populace
seated
in
parallel
rows
at
desks
before
her
miss
clara
the
teacher
lacked
aunt
cordelia
optimism
also
her
plumpness
no
doubt
she
can
agreed
miss
clara
politely
but
without
enthusiasm
miss
clara
had
stepped
from
the
graduating
rostrum
to
the
platform
and
she
had
been
there
some
years
and
when
one
has
been
there
some
years
and
is
already
battling
with
seventy
little
boys
and
girls
one
can
not
greet
the
advent
of
a
with
acclaim
even
the
fact
that
one
hair
is
red
is
not
an
always
sure
indication
that
one
temperament
is
sanguine
also
so
in
answer
to
aunt
cordelia
miss
clara
replied
politely
but
without
enthusiasm
no
doubt
she
can
then
aunt
cordelia
went
and
miss
clara
gave
emmy
lou
a
desk
and
miss
clara
then
rapping
sharply
and
calling
some
small
delinquent
to
order
emmy
lou
heart
sank
within
her
now
miss
clara
tones
were
tart
because
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
this
late
comer
in
a
class
of
seventy
spare
time
is
not
offering
for
the
bringing
up
of
the
backward
the
way
of
the
primer
teacher
was
not
made
easy
in
a
public
school
of
years
ago
so
miss
clara
told
the
new
pupil
to
copy
digits
now
what
digits
were
emmy
lou
had
no
idea
but
being
shown
them
on
the
blackboard
she
copied
them
diligently
and
as
the
time
went
on
emmy
lou
went
on
copying
digits
and
her
one
endeavor
being
to
avoid
the
notice
of
miss
clara
it
happened
the
needs
of
emmy
lou
were
frequently
lost
sight
of
in
the
more
assertive
claims
of
the
seventy
emmy
lou
was
not
catching
up
and
it
was
january
but
was
to
be
different
the
little
boy
was
nodding
and
beckoning
so
far
the
seventy
had
left
emmy
lou
alone
as
a
general
thing
the
herd
crowds
toward
the
leaders
and
the
laggard
brings
up
the
rear
alone
but
the
little
boy
was
beckoning
emmy
lou
looked
up
emmy
lou
was
and
chubby
and
in
her
heart
there
was
no
guile
there
was
an
ease
and
swagger
about
the
little
boy
and
he
always
knew
when
to
stand
up
and
what
for
emmy
lou
more
than
once
had
failed
to
stand
up
and
miss
clara
reminder
had
been
sharp
it
was
when
a
bell
rang
one
must
stand
up
but
what
for
emmy
lou
never
knew
until
after
the
others
began
to
do
it
but
the
little
boy
always
knew
emmy
lou
had
heard
him
too
out
on
the
bench
glibly
tell
miss
clara
about
the
mat
and
a
bat
and
a
black
rat
he
stood
forth
with
confidence
and
told
about
a
fat
hen
emmy
lou
was
glad
to
have
the
little
boy
beckon
her
and
in
her
heart
there
was
no
guile
that
the
little
boy
should
be
holding
out
an
end
of
a
severed
band
and
inviting
her
to
take
it
was
no
stranger
than
other
things
happening
in
the
primer
world
every
day
the
very
manner
of
the
infant
classification
breathed
mystery
the
sheep
from
the
goats
so
to
speak
the
little
girls
all
one
side
the
central
aisle
the
little
boys
all
the
other
and
to
overstep
the
line
of
demarcation
a
thing
too
dreadful
to
contemplate
many
things
were
strange
that
one
must
get
up
suddenly
when
a
bell
rang
was
strange
and
to
copy
digits
until
one
chubby
fingers
tightly
gripping
the
pencil
ached
and
then
to
be
expected
to
take
a
sponge
and
wash
those
digits
off
was
strange
and
to
be
told
crossly
to
sit
down
was
bewildering
when
in
answer
to
c
a
t
one
said
pussy
and
yet
there
was
pussy
washing
her
face
on
the
chart
and
miss
clara
pointer
pointing
to
her
so
when
the
little
boy
held
out
the
rubber
band
across
the
aisle
emmy
lou
took
the
proffered
end
at
this
the
little
boy
slid
back
into
his
desk
holding
to
his
end
at
the
critical
moment
of
elongation
the
little
boy
let
go
and
the
property
of
elasticity
is
to
rebound
emmy
lou
heart
stood
still
then
it
swelled
but
in
her
filling
eyes
there
was
no
suspicion
only
hurt
and
even
while
a
tear
splashed
down
and
falling
upon
the
laboriously
copied
digits
wrought
havoc
she
smiled
bravely
across
at
the
little
boy
it
would
have
made
the
little
boy
feel
bad
to
know
how
it
hurt
so
emmy
lou
winked
bravely
and
smiled
whereupon
the
little
boy
wheeled
about
suddenly
and
fell
to
copying
digits
furiously
nor
did
he
look
emmy
lou
way
only
drove
his
pencil
into
his
slate
with
a
fervor
that
made
miss
clara
rap
sharply
on
her
desk
illustration
emmy
lou
winked
bravely
and
smiled
emmy
lou
wondered
if
the
little
boy
was
mad
one
would
think
it
had
stung
the
little
boy
and
not
her
but
since
he
was
not
looking
she
felt
free
to
let
her
little
fist
seek
her
mouth
for
comfort
nor
did
emmy
lou
dream
that
across
the
aisle
remorse
was
eating
into
a
little
boy
soul
or
that
along
with
remorse
there
went
the
image
of
one
emmy
lou
defenceless
and
smiling
bravely
the
next
morning
emmy
lou
was
early
she
was
always
early
since
entering
the
primer
class
breakfast
had
lost
its
savor
to
emmy
lou
in
the
terror
of
being
late
but
this
morning
the
little
boy
was
there
before
her
hitherto
his
tardy
and
clattering
arrival
had
been
a
daily
happening
provocative
of
accents
sharp
and
energetic
from
miss
clara
but
this
morning
he
was
at
his
desk
copying
from
his
primer
on
to
his
slate
the
easy
ostentatious
way
in
which
he
glanced
from
slate
to
book
was
not
lost
upon
emmy
lou
who
lost
her
place
whenever
her
eyes
left
the
rows
of
digits
upon
the
blackboard
emmy
lou
watched
the
performance
and
the
little
boy
pencil
drove
with
furious
ease
and
its
path
was
marked
with
flourishes
emmy
lou
never
dreamed
that
it
was
because
she
was
watching
that
the
little
boy
was
moved
to
this
brilliant
exhibition
presently
reaching
the
end
of
his
page
he
looked
up
carelessly
incidentally
it
seemed
to
be
borne
to
him
that
emmy
lou
was
there
whereupon
he
nodded
then
as
if
moved
by
sudden
impulse
he
dived
into
his
desk
and
after
ostentatious
search
in
on
under
it
brought
forth
a
pencil
and
held
it
up
for
emmy
lou
to
see
nor
did
she
dream
that
it
was
for
this
the
little
boy
had
been
there
since
before
uncle
michael
had
unlocked
the
primer
door
emmy
lou
looked
across
at
the
pencil
it
was
a
a
fine
long
new
grandly
encased
for
half
its
length
in
gold
paper
one
bought
them
at
the
across
from
the
school
and
one
paid
for
them
the
whole
of
five
cents
just
then
a
bell
rang
emmy
lou
got
up
suddenly
but
it
was
the
bell
for
school
to
take
up
so
she
sat
down
she
was
glad
miss
clara
was
not
yet
in
her
place
after
the
primer
class
had
filed
in
with
panting
and
frosty
entrance
the
bell
rang
again
this
time
it
was
the
right
bell
tapped
by
miss
clara
now
in
her
place
so
again
emmy
lou
got
up
suddenly
and
by
following
the
little
girl
ahead
learned
that
the
bell
meant
go
out
to
the
bench
the
primer
class
according
to
the
degree
of
its
infant
precocity
was
divided
in
three
sections
emmy
lou
belonged
to
the
third
section
it
was
the
last
section
and
she
was
the
last
one
in
it
though
she
had
no
idea
what
a
section
meant
nor
why
she
was
in
it
yesterday
the
third
section
had
said
over
and
over
in
chorus
one
and
one
are
two
two
and
two
are
four
but
they
said
two
and
one
are
three
two
and
two
are
four
emmy
lou
wondered
four
what
which
put
her
behind
so
that
when
she
began
again
they
were
saying
two
and
four
are
six
so
now
she
knew
four
is
six
but
what
is
six
emmy
lou
did
not
know
when
she
came
back
to
her
desk
the
pencil
was
there
the
fine
new
long
encased
in
gold
paper
and
the
little
boy
was
gone
he
belonged
to
the
first
section
and
the
first
section
was
now
on
the
bench
emmy
lou
leaned
across
and
put
the
pencil
back
on
the
little
boy
desk
then
she
prepared
herself
to
copy
digits
with
her
stump
of
a
pencil
emmy
lou
were
always
stumps
her
pencil
had
a
way
of
rolling
off
her
desk
while
she
was
gone
and
one
pencil
makes
many
stumps
the
little
boy
had
generally
helped
her
pick
them
up
on
her
return
but
strangely
from
this
time
her
pencils
rolled
off
no
more
but
when
emmy
lou
took
up
her
slate
there
was
a
whole
side
filled
with
digits
in
soldierly
rows
across
so
her
heart
grew
light
and
free
from
the
weight
of
digits
and
she
gave
her
time
to
the
washing
of
her
desk
a
thing
in
which
her
soul
revelled
and
for
which
patterning
after
her
little
girl
neighbors
she
kept
within
that
desk
a
bottle
of
soapy
water
and
rags
of
a
gray
and
unpleasant
nature
that
never
dried
because
of
their
frequent
using
when
emmy
lou
first
came
to
school
her
cleaning
paraphernalia
consisted
of
a
sponge
secured
by
a
string
to
her
slate
which
was
the
badge
of
the
new
and
the
unsophisticated
comer
emmy
lou
had
quickly
learned
that
and
no
one
now
rejoiced
in
a
fuller
assortment
of
soap
bottle
and
rags
than
she
nor
did
a
sponge
longer
dangle
from
the
frame
of
her
slate
on
coming
in
from
recess
this
same
day
emmy
lou
found
the
pencil
on
her
desk
again
the
beautiful
new
pencil
in
the
gilded
paper
she
put
it
back
but
when
she
reached
home
the
pencil
the
beautiful
pencil
that
cost
all
of
five
cents
was
in
her
companion
box
along
with
her
stumps
and
her
sponge
and
her
grimy
little
slate
rags
and
about
the
pencil
was
wrapped
a
piece
of
paper
it
had
the
look
of
the
margin
of
a
primer
page
the
paper
bore
marks
they
were
not
digits
emmy
lou
took
the
paper
to
aunt
cordelia
they
were
at
dinner
ca
you
read
it
emmy
lou
asked
aunt
katie
the
prettiest
aunty
emmy
lou
shook
her
head
i
spell
the
letters
said
aunt
louise
the
youngest
aunty
but
that
did
not
help
emmy
lou
one
bit
aunt
cordelia
looked
troubled
she
does
seem
to
be
catching
up
she
said
no
said
aunt
katie
no
agreed
aunt
louise
nor
on
said
uncle
charlie
the
brother
of
the
aunties
lighting
his
cigar
to
go
downtown
aunt
cordelia
spread
the
paper
out
it
bore
the
words
it
is
for
you
illustration
emmy
lou
shook
her
head
so
emmy
lou
put
the
pencil
away
in
the
companion
and
tucked
it
about
with
the
grimy
slate
rags
that
no
harm
might
befall
it
and
the
next
day
she
took
it
out
and
used
it
but
first
she
looked
over
at
the
little
boy
the
little
boy
was
busy
but
when
she
looked
up
again
he
was
looking
the
little
boy
grew
red
and
wheeling
suddenly
fell
to
copying
digits
furiously
and
from
that
moment
on
the
little
boy
was
moved
to
strange
behavior
three
times
before
recess
did
he
boldly
ignoring
the
preface
of
upraised
hand
swagger
up
to
miss
clara
desk
and
going
and
coming
the
little
boy
boots
with
copper
toes
and
heels
marked
with
thumping
emphasis
upon
the
echoing
boards
his
processional
and
recessional
and
reaching
his
desk
the
little
boy
slammed
down
his
slate
with
clattering
reverberations
emmy
lou
watched
him
uneasily
she
was
miserable
for
him
she
did
not
know
that
there
are
times
when
the
emotions
are
more
potent
than
the
subtlest
wines
nor
did
she
know
that
the
male
of
some
species
is
moved
thus
to
exhibition
of
prowess
courage
defiance
for
the
impressing
of
the
chosen
female
of
the
species
emmy
lou
merely
knew
that
she
was
miserable
and
that
she
trembled
for
the
little
boy
having
clattered
his
slate
until
miss
clara
rapped
sharply
the
little
boy
arose
and
went
swaggering
on
an
excursion
around
the
room
to
where
sat
the
bucket
and
dipper
and
on
his
return
he
came
up
the
centre
aisle
between
the
sheep
and
the
goats
emmy
lou
had
no
idea
what
happened
it
took
place
behind
her
but
there
was
another
little
girl
who
did
a
little
girl
who
boasted
curls
yellow
curls
in
tiered
rows
about
her
head
a
lachrymosal
little
girl
who
affected
great
horror
of
the
little
boys
and
what
emmy
lou
failed
to
see
was
this
the
little
boy
in
passing
deftly
lift
a
cherished
curl
between
finger
and
thumb
and
proceed
on
his
way
the
little
girl
did
not
fail
the
little
boy
in
the
suddenness
of
the
surprise
she
surprised
even
him
by
her
outcry
miss
clara
jumped
emmy
lou
jumped
and
the
jumped
and
following
this
the
little
girl
lifted
her
voice
in
lachrymal
lament
miss
clara
sat
erect
the
primer
class
held
its
breath
it
always
held
its
breath
when
miss
clara
sat
erect
emmy
lou
held
tightly
to
her
desk
besides
she
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
then
miss
clara
spoke
her
accents
cut
the
silence
billy
traver
billy
traver
stood
forth
it
was
the
little
boy
since
you
seem
pleased
to
occupy
yourself
with
the
little
girls
billy
to
the
emmy
lou
trembled
go
to
the
pegs
what
unknown
inquisitorial
terrors
lay
behind
those
dread
laconic
words
emmy
lou
knew
not
she
could
only
sit
and
watch
the
little
boy
turn
and
stump
back
down
the
aisle
and
around
the
room
to
where
along
the
wall
hung
rows
of
feminine
apparel
here
he
stopped
and
scanned
the
line
then
he
paused
before
a
hat
it
was
a
round
little
hat
with
silky
nap
and
a
curling
brim

had
rosettes
to
keep
the
ears
warm
and
ribbon
that
tied
beneath
the
chin
it
was
emmy
lou
hat
aunt
cordelia
had
cautioned
her
to
care
concerning
it
the
little
boy
took
it
down
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
what
miss
clara
meant
but
then
he
had
been
in
the
primer
class
from
the
beginning
illustration
emmy
lou
did
not
laugh
she
made
room
for
billy
having
taken
the
hat
down
he
proceeded
to
put
it
upon
his
own
shock
head
his
face
wore
its
broad
and
constant
smile
one
would
have
said
the
little
boy
was
enjoying
the
affair
as
he
put
the
hat
on
the
laughed
the
seventieth
did
not
it
was
her
hat
and
besides
she
did
not
understand
miss
clara
still
erect
spoke
again
and
now
since
you
are
a
little
girl
get
your
book
billy
and
move
over
with
the
girls
nor
did
emmy
lou
understand
why
when
billy
having
gathered
his
belongings
together
moved
across
the
aisle
and
sat
down
with
her
the
laughed
again
emmy
lou
did
not
laugh
she
made
room
for
billy
nor
did
she
understand
when
billy
treated
her
to
a
slow
and
surreptitious
wink
his
freckled
countenance
grinning
beneath
the
rosetted
hat
it
never
could
have
occurred
to
emmy
lou
that
billy
had
laid
his
cunning
plans
to
this
very
end
emmy
lou
understood
nothing
of
all
this
she
only
pitied
billy
and
presently
when
public
attention
had
become
diverted
she
proffered
him
the
hospitality
of
a
grimy
little
slate
rag
when
billy
returned
the
rag
there
was
something
in
it
something
wrapped
in
a
beautiful
glazed
shining
bronze
paper
it
was
a
candy
kiss
one
paid
five
cents
for
six
of
them
at
the
on
the
road
home
emmy
lou
ate
the
candy
the
beautiful
shiny
paper
she
put
in
her
primer
the
slip
of
paper
that
she
found
within
she
carried
to
aunt
cordelia
it
was
sticky
and
it
was
smeared
but
it
had
reading
on
it
but
this
is
printing
said
aunt
cordelia
ca
you
read
it
emmy
lou
shook
her
head
try
said
aunt
katie
the
easy
words
said
aunt
louise
but
emmy
lou
remembering
pussy
shook
her
head
aunt
cordelia
looked
troubled
she
certainly
is
catching
up
said
aunt
cordelia
then
she
read
from
the
slip
of
paper
oh
woman
woman
thou
wert
made
the
peace
of
adam
to
invade
the
aunties
laughed
but
emmy
lou
put
it
away
with
the
glazed
paper
in
her
primer
it
meant
quite
as
much
to
her
as
did
the
reading
in
that
primer
cat
a
cat
the
cat
the
bat
the
mat
a
rat
it
was
the
jingle
to
both
that
appealed
to
emmy
lou
about
this
time
rumors
began
to
reach
emmy
lou
she
heard
that
it
was
february
and
that
wonderful
things
were
peculiar
to
the
fourteenth
at
recess
the
little
girls
locked
arms
and
talked
valentines
the
echoes
reached
emmy
lou
the
valentines
must
come
from
a
little
boy
or
it
was
the
real
thing
and
to
get
no
valentine
was
a
dreadful
dreadful
thing
and
even
the
timidest
of
the
sheep
began
to
cast
eyes
across
at
the
goats
emmy
lou
wondered
if
she
would
get
a
valentine
and
if
not
how
was
she
to
survive
the
contumely
and
shame
you
must
never
never
breathe
to
a
living
soul
what
was
on
your
valentine
to
tell
even
your
best
and
truest
little
girl
friend
was
to
prove
faithless
to
the
little
boy
sending
the
valentine
these
things
reached
emmy
lou
not
for
the
world
would
she
tell
emmy
lou
was
sure
of
that
so
grateful
did
she
feel
she
would
be
to
anyone
sending
her
a
valentine
and
in
doubt
and
wretchedness
did
she
wend
her
way
to
school
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
february
the
window
was
full
of
valentines
but
emmy
lou
crossed
the
street
she
did
not
want
to
see
them
she
knew
the
little
girls
would
ask
her
if
she
had
gotten
a
valentine
and
she
would
have
to
say
no
she
was
early
the
big
empty
room
echoed
back
her
footsteps
as
she
went
to
her
desk
to
lay
down
book
and
slate
before
taking
off
her
wraps
nor
did
emmy
lou
dream
the
eye
of
the
little
boy
peeped
through
the
crack
of
the
door
from
miss
clara
emmy
lou
hat
and
jacket
were
forgotten
on
her
desk
lay
something
square
and
white
it
was
an
envelope
it
was
a
beautiful
envelope
all
over
flowers
and
scrolls
emmy
lou
knew
it
it
was
a
valentine
her
cheeks
grew
pink
she
took
it
out
it
was
blue
and
it
was
gold
and
it
had
reading
on
it
emmy
lou
heart
sank
she
could
not
read
the
reading
the
door
opened
some
little
girls
came
in
emmy
lou
hid
her
valentine
in
her
book
for
since
you
must
not
she
would
never
show
her
valentine
never
the
little
girls
wanted
to
know
if
she
had
gotten
a
valentine
and
emmy
lou
said
yes
and
her
cheeks
were
pink
with
the
joy
of
being
able
to
say
it
through
the
day
she
took
peeps
between
the
covers
of
her
primer
but
no
one
else
might
see
it
it
rested
heavy
on
emmy
lou
heart
however
that
there
was
reading
on
it
she
studied
it
surreptitiously
the
reading
was
made
up
of
letters
it
was
the
first
time
emmy
lou
had
thought
about
that
she
knew
some
of
the
letters
she
would
ask
someone
the
letters
she
did
not
know
by
pointing
them
out
on
the
chart
at
recess
emmy
lou
was
learning
it
was
the
first
time
since
she
came
to
school
but
what
did
the
letters
make
she
wondered
after
recess
studying
the
valentine
again
then
she
went
home
she
followed
aunt
cordelia
about
aunt
cordelia
was
busy
illustration
she
sought
the
what
does
it
read
asked
emmy
lou
aunt
cordelia
listened
b
said
emmy
lou
and
e
be
said
aunt
cordelia
if
b
was
be
it
was
strange
that
b
and
e
were

but
many
things

strange
emmy
lou
accepted
them
all
on
faith
after
dinner
she
approached
aunt
katie
what
does
it
read
asked
emmy
lou
m
and
y
my
said
aunt
katie
the
rest
was
harder
she
could
not
remember
the
letters
and
had
to
copy
them
off
on
her
slate
then
she
sought
tom
the
tom
was
out
at
the
gate
talking
to
another
she
waited
until
the
other
boy
was
gone
what
does
it
read
asked
emmy
lou
and
she
told
the
letters
off
the
slate
it
took
tom
some
time
but
finally
he
told
her
just
then
a
little
girl
came
along
she
was
a
little
girl
and
at
school
she
never
noticed
emmy
lou
now
she
was
alone
so
she
stopped

any
valentines

said
emmy
lou
then
moved
to
confidence
by
the
little
friendliness
she
added
it

the
little
girl

long
verses

the
little
girl
the
gas

lit
when
emmy
lou
came
in
uncle
charlie

there
and
the
aunties
sitting
around
reading

emmy
lou

all
looked
up

forgotten

it
came
to
them
that

emmy

not
gone
away

year
before

day

aunt
cordelia
smoothed
the
black
dress
she
was
wearing
because
of
the
mother
who
would
never
come
back
and
looked
troubled
but
emmy
lou
laid
the
blue
and
gold
valentine
on
aunt
cordelia
knee
in
the
valentine
centre

two
hands

said
uncle
charlie
a
little
feminine
casabianca
the
close
of
the
first
week
of
emmy
lou
second
year
at
a
certain
large
public
school
found
her
round
chubby
self
like
a
period
ending
the
long
line
of
intermingled
little
boys
and
girls
making
what
was
known
years
ago
as
the
class
emmy
lou
had
spent
her
first
year
in
the
primer
class
where
the
teacher
miss
clara
by
name
had
concealed
the
kindliest
of
hearts
behind
a
brusque
and
energetic
manner
and
had
possessed
along
with
her
red
hair
and
a
temper
tinged
with
that
color
also
a
sharp
voice
that
by
its
unexpected
snap
in
attacking
some
small
sinner
had
caused
emmy
little
heart
to
jump
many
times
a
day
here
emmy
lou
had
spent
the
year
in
strenuously
guiding
a
squeaking
pencil
across
a
protesting
slate
or
singing
in
chorus
as
miss
clara
long
wooden
pointer
went
up
and
down
the
rows
of
words
on
the
at
bat
cat
or
an
ban
can
emmy
lou
herself
had
so
little
idea
of
what
it
was
all
about
that
she
was
dependent
on
her
neighbor
to
give
her
the
key
to
the
proper
heading
the
various
columns
at
or
an
or
et
or
on
after
that
it
was
easy
sailing
but
one
awful
day
while
the
class
stopped
suddenly
at
miss
clara
warning
finger
as
visitors
opened
the
door
emmy
lou
her
eyes
squeezed
tight
shut
her
little
body
rocking
to
and
fro
to
the
rhythm
went
right
on
man
pan
until
at
the
sound
of
her
own
little
voice
rising
with
appalling
fervor
upon
the
silence
she
stopped
to
find
that
the
page
in
the
meantime
had
been
turned
and
that
the
pointer
was
directed
to
a
column
beginning
oy
illustration
guiding
a
squeaking
pencil
across
a
protesting
slate
among
other
things
incident
to
that
first
year
too
had
been
recess
at
that
time
everybody
was
turned
out
into
a
yard
the
boys
on
one
side
of
a
high
fence
the
girls
on
the
other
and
here
waiting
without
the
wooden
shed
where
stood
a
row
of
buckets
each
holding
a
shiny
tin
dipper
emmy
lou
would
stop
on
the
sloppy
outskirts
for
the
thirst
of
the
larger
girls
to
be
assuaged
that
the
little
opportunity
might
come
together
with
the
dregs
in
the
buckets
and
at
recess
too
along
with
the
danger
of
being
run
into
by
the
larger
girls
at
play
and
having
the
breath
knocked
out
of
one
little
body
which
made
it
necessary
to
seek
sequestered
corners
and
peep
out
thence
there
was
the
man
to
be
watched
for
and
avoided
the
low
square
man
who
brandished
a
broom
at
the
little
girls
who
dropped
their
and
crusts
on
the
pavements
and
who
shook
his
fist
at
the
jeering
little
boys
who
dared
to
swarm
to
the
forbidden
top
and
sit
straddling
the
dividing
fence
that
uncle
michael
the
janitor
was
getting
old
and
had
rheumatic
twinges
was
indeed
uncle
michael
excuse
but
emmy
lou
did
not
know
this
and
her
fear
of
uncle
michael
was
great
accordingly
but
somehow
the
primer
year
wore
away
and
one
day
toward
its
close
in
the
presence
of
miss
clara
two
gentlemen
requested
certain
little
boys
to
cipher
and
several
little
girls
to
spell
and
sent
others
to
the
blackboard
or
the
chart
while
to
emmy
lou
was
handed
a
primer
open
at
page
which
she
was
told
to
read
knowing
page
by
heart
and
identifying
it
by
its
picture
emmy
lou
arose
and
her
small
voice
droned
forth
in
fashion
how
old
are
you
sue
i
am
as
old
as
my
cat
and
how
old
is
your
cat
my
cat
is
as
old
as
my
dog
and
how
old
is
your
dog
my
dog
is
as
old
as
i
am
having
so
delivered
herself
emmy
lou
sat
down
not
at
all
disconcerted
to
find
that
she
had
been
holding
her
primer
upside
down
following
this
emmy
lou
was
told
that
she
had
passed
and
seeing
from
the
jubilance
of
the
other
children
that
it
was
a
matter
to
be
joyful
over
emmy
lou
went
home
and
told
the
elders
of
her
family
that
she
had
passed
and
these
elders
three
aunties
and
an
uncle
an
uncle
who
was
disposed
to
look
at
emmy
lou
chubby
self
and
her
concerns
in
jocular
fashion
laughed
and
emmy
lou
went
on
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
which
never
would
have
been
the
case
had
there
been
a
mother
among
the
elders
for
mothers
have
a
way
of
understanding
these
things
but
to
emmy
lou
mother
had
come
to
mean
but
a
memory
which
faded
as
it
came
a
vague
consciousness
of
encircling
arms
of
a
brooding
tender
face
of
yearning
eyes
and
it
was
only
because
they
told
her
that
emmy
lou
remembered
how
mother
had
gone
away
south
one
winter
to
get
well
that
they
afterward
told
her
it
was
heaven
in
no
wise
confused
emmy
lou
because
for
aught
she
knew
south
and
heaven
and
much
else
might
be
included
in
these
points
of
the
compass
ever
since
then
emmy
lou
had
lived
with
the
three
aunties
and
the
uncle
and
papa
had
been
coming
a
hundred
miles
once
a
month
to
see
her
when
emmy
lou
went
back
to
school
for
the
second
year
she
was
told
that
she
was
now
in
the
first
reader
if
her
heart
had
jumped
at
the
sharp
accents
of
miss
clara
it
now
grew
still
within
her
at
the
slow
awful
enunciation
of
the
large
lady
in
black
bombazine
who
reigned
over
the
department
of
the
first
reader
pointing
her
morals
with
a
heavy
forefinger
before
which
emmy
lou
eyes
lowered
with
every
aspect
of
conscious
guilt
nor
did
emmy
lou
dream
that
the
large
lady
whose
black
bombazine
was
the
visible
sign
of
a
loss
by
death
that
had
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
enter
the
to
earn
a
living
was
finding
the
duties
incident
to
the
first
reader
almost
as
strange
and
perplexing
as
emmy
lou
herself
emmy
lou
from
the
first
day
found
herself
descending
steadily
to
the
foot
of
the
class
and
there
she
remained
until
the
awful
day
at
the
close
of
the
first
week
when
the
large
lady
realizing
perhaps
that
she
could
no
longer
ignore
such
adherence
to
that
lowly
position
made
discovery
that
while
to
emmy
lou
might
dog
and
might
frog
emmy
lou
could
not
find
either
on
a
printed
page
and
further
could
not
tell
wherein
they
differed
when
found
for
her
that
also
emmy
lou
made
her
figure
by
adding
one
uncertain
little
o
to
the
top
of
another
uncertain
little
o
and
that
while
emmy
lou
might
copy
in
smeary
columns
certain
cabalistic
signs
off
the
blackboard
she
could
not
point
them
off
in
tens
hundreds
thousands
or
read
their
numerical
values
to
save
her
little
life
the
large
lady
sorely
perplexed
within
herself
as
to
the
proper
course
to
be
pursued
in
the
sight
of
the
other
pointed
a
condemning
forefinger
at
the
miserable
little
object
standing
in
front
of
her
platform
and
said
you
will
stay
after
school
emma
louise
that
i
may
examine
further
into
your
qualifications
for
this
grade
illustration
sounds
grew
fewer
fainter
farther
away
a
door
slammed
somewhere
then
silence
now
emmy
lou
had
no
idea
what
it
meant
examine
further
into
your
qualifications
for
this
grade
it
might
be
the
form
of
punishment
in
vogue
for
the
chastisement
of
the
members
of
the
first
reader
but
stay
after
school
she
did
understand
and
her
heart
sank
and
her
little
breast
heaved
it
was
then
past
the
noon
recess
in
those
days
in
this
particular
city
school
closed
at
one
at
last
the
bell
for
dismissal
had
rung
the
large
lady
arms
folded
across
her
bombazine
bosom
had
faced
the
class
and
with
awesome
solemnity
had
already
enunciated
attention
and
sixty
little
people
had
sat
up
straight
when
the
door
opened
and
a
teacher
from
the
floor
above
came
in
at
her
whispered
confidence
the
large
lady
left
the
room
hastily
while
the
strange
teacher
with
a
hurried
one
two
three
march
out
quietly
children
turned
and
followed
her
and
emmy
lou
left
sitting
at
her
desk
saw
through
gathering
tears
the
line
of
wind
around
the
room
and
file
out
the
door
the
sound
of
their
departing
footsteps
along
the
bare
corridors
and
down
the
echoing
stairway
coming
back
like
a
knell
to
her
sinking
heart
then
class
after
class
from
above
marched
past
the
door
and
on
its
clattering
way
while
voices
from
outside
shrill
with
the
joy
of
the
release
came
up
through
the
open
windows
in
talk
in
laughter
together
with
the
patter
of
feet
on
the
bricks
then
as
these
familiar
sounds
grew
fewer
fainter
farther
away
some
belated
footsteps
went
echoing
through
the
building
a
door
slammed
somewhere
then
silence
emmy
lou
waited
she
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
there
was
watermelon
at
home
for
dinner
she
had
seen
it
borne
in
a
great
striped
promise
of
ripe
and
juicy
lusciousness
on
the
marketman
shoulder
before
she
came
to
school
and
here
a
tear
long
gathering
splashed
down
the
pink
cheek
still
that
awesome
personage
presiding
over
the
fortunes
of
the
failed
to
return
perhaps
this
was
the
examination
into
into
emmy
lou
could
not
remember
what
to
be
left
in
this
big
bare
room
with
the
flies
droning
and
humming
in
lazy
circles
up
near
the
ceiling
the
forsaken
desks
with
a
forgotten
book
or
slate
left
here
and
there
upon
them
the
pegs
around
the
wall
empty
of
hats
and
bonnets
the
unoccupied
chair
upon
the
platform
emmy
lou
gazed
at
these
with
a
sinking
sensation
of
desolation
while
tear
followed
tear
down
her
chubby
face
and
listening
to
the
flies
and
the
silence
emmy
lou
began
to
long
for
even
the
bombazine
presence
and
dropping
her
quivering
countenance
upon
her
arms
folded
upon
the
desk
she
sobbed
aloud
but
the
time
was
long
and
the
day
was
warm
and
the
sobs
grew
slower
and
the
breath
began
to
come
in
quivering
sighs
and
the
next
emmy
lou
knew
she
was
sitting
upright
trembling
in
every
limb
and
someone
coming
up
the
stairs
she
could
hear
the
slow
heavy
footfalls
and
a
moment
after
she
saw
the
man
the
recess
man
the
low
scowling
man
with
the
broom
across
his
shoulder
reach
the
hallway
and
make
toward
the
open
doorway
of
the
room
emmy
lou
held
her
breath
stiffened
her
little
body
and
waited
but
the
man
pausing
to
light
his
pipe
emmy
lou
in
the
sudden
respite
thus
afforded
slid
in
a
trembling
heap
beneath
the
desk
and
on
hands
and
knees
went
crawling
across
the
floor
and
as
uncle
michael
came
in
a
moment
after
broom
pan
and
in
hand
the
last
fluttering
edge
of
a
little
pink
dress
was
disappearing
into
the
depths
of
the
big
empty
and
its
sloping
lid
was
lowering
upon
a
flaxen
head
and
cowering
little
figure
crouched
within
uncle
michael
having
put
the
room
to
rights
sweeping
and
dusting
with
many
a
rheumatic
groan
in
accompaniment
closed
the
windows
and
going
out
drew
the
door
after
him
and
as
was
his
custom
locked
it
meanwhile
at
emmy
lou
home
the
elders
wondered
you
do
know
emmy
lou
aunt
cordelia
round
plump
and
cheery
insisted
to
the
lady
visitor
spending
the
day
emmy
lou
never
loiters
aunt
katie
the
prettiest
auntie
cut
off
a
thick
round
of
melon
as
they
arose
from
the
table
and
put
it
in
the
refrigerator
for
emmy
lou
it
seems
a
joke
she
remarked
such
a
baby
as
emmy
lou
going
to
school
anyhow
but
then
she
has
only
a
square
to
go
and
come
but
emmy
lou
did
not
come
and
by
two
aunt
louise
the
youngest
auntie
started
out
to
find
her
but
as
she
stopped
on
the
way
at
the
houses
of
all
the
neighbors
to
inquire
and
ran
around
the
corner
to
cousin
tom
macklin
to
see
if
emmy
lou
could
be
there
and
then
being
but
a
few
doors
off
went
on
around
that
corner
to
cousin
amanda
the
when
she
finally
reached
it
was
locked
up
with
the
blinds
down
at
every
front
window
as
if
it
had
closed
its
eyes
and
gone
to
sleep
uncle
michael
had
a
way
of
cleaning
and
locking
the
front
of
the
building
first
and
going
in
and
out
at
the
back
doors
but
aunt
louise
did
not
know
this
and
anyhow
she
was
sure
that
she
would
find
emmy
lou
at
home
when
she
got
there
but
emmy
lou
was
not
at
home
and
it
being
now
well
on
in
the
afternoon
aunt
katie
and
aunt
louise

while
aunt
cordelia
sent
the
downtown
for

charlie
just
as
uncle
charlie
arrived
and
it
was
past
five
by
then
some
of
the
children
of
the
neighborhood

found
a
small
boy

some
squares
off

the

from

in
knickerbocker

at
the
crowd
of

scornful
wonder

much
outer
my
way
condescendingly
take
you
there
and
meekly
they
followed
in
his
footsteps
it
was
dark
when
a
motley
throng
of
uncle
aunties
visiting
lady
neighbors
and
children
went
climbing
the
cavernous
echoing
stairway
of
the
dark
school
building
behind
the
toiling
figure
of
the
skeptical
uncle
michael
lantern
in
hand
ai
i
swept
over
every
inch
of
this
here
myself
and
carried
the
trash
outten
a
grumbled
uncle
michael
with
what
inference
nobody
just
then
stopped
to
inquire
then
with
the
air
of
a
mistreated
aggrieved
person
who
feels
himself
a
victim
he
paused
before
a
certain
door
on
the
second
floor
and
fitted
a
key
in
its
lock
here
it
is
then
no
to
satisfy
the
lady
and
he
flung
open
the
door
the
light
of
uncle
michael
lantern
fell
full
upon
the
person
of
emmy
lou
in
her
desk
awaiting
her
miserable
little
heart
knew
not
what
horror
she
she
told
me
to
stay
sobbed
emmy
lou
in
aunt
cordelia
arms
and
i
stayed
and
the
man
came
and
i
hid
in
the
and
aunt
cordelia
holding
her
close
sobbed
too
and
aunt
katie
cried
and
aunt
louise
and
the
lady
visitor
cried
and
uncle
charlie
passed
his
plump
white
hand
over
his
eyes
and
said
pshaw
and
the
teacher
of
the
first
reader
when
she
heard
about
it
next
day
cried
hardest
of
them
all
so
hard
that
not
even
aunt
cordelia
could
cherish
a
feeling
against
her
or
the
bliss
of
ignorance
there
was
head
and
foot
in
the
second
reader
emmy
lou
heard
it
whispered
the
day
of
her
entrance
into
the
room
once
head
and
foot
had
meant
aunt
cordelia
above
the
coffee
tray
and
uncle
charlie
below
the
but
at
school
head
and
foot
meant
little
girls
bobbing
up
and
down
descending
and
ascending
the
scale
of
excellency
there
were
no
little
boys
at
the
second
reader
the
currents
of
the
sexes
divided
and
little
boys
were
swept
out
of
sight
one
mentioned
little
boys
now
in
undertones
but
head
and
foot
meant
something
beside
little
girls
bobbing
out
of
their
places
on
the
bench
to
take
a
neighbor
place
head
and
foot
meant
tears
that
is
when
the
bobbing
was
downward
and
not
up
however
if
one
bobbed
down
there
was
the
chance
of
bobbing
up
that
is
with
all
but
emmy
lou
and
a
little
girl
answering
to
the
call
of
kitty
mckoeghany
step
by
step
kitty
went
up
and
having
reached
the
top
kitty
stayed
there
and
step
by
step
emmy
lou
from
her
original
alphabetically
determined
position
beside
kitty
went
down
and
then
only
because
further
descent
was
impossible
emmy
lou
stayed
there
but
since
the
foot
was
nearest
the
platform
emmy
lou
took
that
comfort
out
of
the
situation
for
the
teacher
sat
on
the
platform
and
emmy
lou
loved
the
teacher
illustration
emmy
lou
the
teacher
was
the
lady
the
nice
lady
the
pretty
lady
with
white
hair
who
patted
little
girls
on
the
cheek
as
she
passed
them
in
the
hall
on
the
first
day
of
school
the
name
of
emily
louise
maclauren
had
been
called
emmy
lou
stood
up
she
looked
at
the
teacher
she
wondered
if
the
teacher
remembered
emmy
lou
was
chubby
and
round
and
much
in
earnest
and
the
lady
the
pretty
lady
looking
down
at
her
smiled
then
emmy
lou
knew
that
the
lady
had
not
forgotten
and
emmy
lou
sat
down
and
she
loved
the
teacher
and
she
loved
the
second
reader
emmy
lou
had
not
heard
the
teacher
name
but
could
her
grateful
little
heart
have
resolved
its
feelings
into
words
dear
teacher
must
ever
after
have
been
the
lady
name
and
so
as
if
impelled
by
her
own
chubby
weight
and
some
force
of
gravity
though
emmy
lou
descended
steadily
to
the
foot
of
the
class
there
were
compensations
the
foot
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
platform
and
within
the
range
of
dear
teacher
smile
besides
there
was
hattie
illustration
kitty
mckoeghany
emmy
lou
sat
with
hattie
they
sat
at
a
front
desk
hattie
had
plaits
small
affairs
perhaps
but
tied
with
ribbons
behind
each
ear
and
the
part
bisecting
hattie
little
head
from
nape
to
crown
was
exact
and
true
emmy
lou
admired
plaits
and
she
admired
the
little
pink
sprigs
on
hattie
dress
after
hattie
and
emmy
lou
had
sat
together
a
whole
day
hattie
took
emmy
lou
aside
as
they
were
going
home
and
whispered
to
her
who
your
mos
nintimate
friend
was
what
emmy

understood
her
to
whisper
emmy

had
no
idea
what
a

hattie
though
small
in
knowledge
emmy
lou
was
large
in
faith
she
confessed
herself
as
glad
to
be
a
nintimate
friend
when
emmy
lou
found
that
to
be
a
nintimate
friend
meant
to
walk
about
the
yard
with
hattie
arm
about
her
she
was
glad
indeed
to
be
one
hitherto
at
recess
emmy
lou
had
known
the
bitterness
of
the
outcast
and
the
pariah
and
had
stood
around
principally
in
corners
to
avoid
being
swept
off
her
little
feet
by
the
big
girls
at
play
and
had
gazed
upon
a

world

to
know
everything

its

scandalised

showed
her

soberly
encased
in
a
calico

hot
she
hid
her

hastily
somehow
she
felt
that
she
had
been
immodest
the
next
day
emmy

came
to

discreetly
swathed
in

he
wore
a
blue
cape
which
he
tossed
on
a
chair
and
he
carried
a
violin
his
name
was
cato
he
drew
five
lines
on
the
blackboard
and
made
eight
dots
that
looked
as
though
they
were
going
upstairs
on
the
lines

he
rapped
on
his
violin
with
his
bow

the

up

to
her
lap
and
when

emmy

cried
and
after
a
while

explained
about

then

said

of

and
in

was
emmy

joy
to
gather
her
doll
children
in
line
and
giving
out

them
for
her
children
but
that
day
the
carriage
which
took
dear
teacher
to
and
from
her
home
outside
of
town
the
carriage
with
the
white
woolly
dog
on
the
seat
by
the
little
driver
and
the
spotted
dog
running
behind
stopped
at
emmy
lou
gate
and
dear
teacher
smiling
at
emmy
lou
just
arriving
with
her
went
in
too
and
rang
the
bell
then
dear
teacher
and
aunt
cordelia
and
aunt
katie
and
aunt
louise
sat
in
the
parlour
and
talked
and
when
dear

all
the
aunties
went
out
to
the
gate
with
her
and
uncle
charlie
just
leaving
put
her
in
the
carriage
and
stood
with
his
hat
lifted
until
she
was
quite
gone
at
her
age
said
aunt
cordelia
to
have
to
teach
said
aunt
katie
how
beautiful
she
must
have
been

aunt

aunt

she
is
keeping
the
home

is
happy
and
aunt
cordelia
took
emmy
hand
that
very
afternoon
aunt
louise
began
to
help
emmy
lou
with
her
lessons
and
aunt
cordelia
went
around
and
asked
hattie
mother
to
let
hattie
come
and
get
her
lessons
with
emmy
lou
and
at
school
dear
teacher
walking
up
and
down
the
aisles
would
stop
and
her
fingers
would
close
over
and
guide
the
labouring
digits
of
emmy
lou
striving
to
copy
within
certain
ruled
lines
upon
her
slate
the
writing
on
the
blackboard
the
pen
is
the
tongue
of
the
mind
emmy
lou
began
to
learn
as
weeks
went
by
now
and
then
emmy
lou
bobbed
up
a
place
although
sooner
or
later
she
slipped
back
she
was
not
always
at
the
foot
but
no
one
not
even
dear
teacher
who
understood
so
much
realised
one
thing
the
day
after
a
lesson
emmy
lou
knew
it
on
the
day
it
was
recited
emmy
lou
had
lacked
sufficient
time
to
grasp
it
with
ten
words
in
the
spelling
lesson
emmy
lou
listened
letter
by
letter
to
those
ten
droned
out
five
times
down
the
line
then
twice
again
around
the
class
of
fifty
then
emmy
lou
having
already
laboured
faithfully
over
it
knew
her
spelling
lesson
and
at
home
it
was
emmy
lou
joy
to
gather
her
doll
children
in
line
and
giving
out
past
lessons
recite
them
in
turn
for
her
children
and
so
did
emmy
lou
know
by
heart
her
second
reader
as
far
as
she
had
gone
she
often
gave
the
lesson
with
her
book
upside
down
and
an
old
and
battered
doll
dearest
to
emmy
lou
heart
was
always
head
and
hattie
the
newest
doll
was
next
even
the
emmy
lous
must
square
with
fate
somehow
along
in
the
year
a
new
feature
was
introduced
in
the
second
reader
the
second
reader
was
to
have
a
medal
dear
teacher
did
not
seem
enthusiastic
she
seemed
to
dread
tears
but
it
was
decreed
that
the
school
was
to
use
medals
at
recess
emmy
lou
asked
hattie
what
a
medal
was
the
big
fourth
and
fifth
reader
girls
were
playing
games
from
which
the
little
girls
were
excluded
for
the
school
was
large
and
the
yard
was
small
at
one
time
it
had
seemed
to
emmy
lou
that
the
odium
the
obloquy
the
reproach
of
being
a
little
girl
was
more
than
she
could
bear
but
she
would
not
change
places
with
anyone
now
she
was
a
nintimate
friend
emmy
lou
asked
hattie
what
it
was
this
medal
hattie
explained
hattie
knew
everything
a
medal
was
well
a
medal
it
hung
on
a
blue
ribbon
each
little
girl
brought
her
own
blue
ribbon
you
wore
it
for
a
week
this
medal
that
afternoon
emmy
lou
went
round
the
corner
to
heinz
little
fancy
store
her
chin
just
came
to
heinz
counter
but
she
knew
what
she
wanted
a
yard
of
blue
ribbon
she
showed
it
to
hattie
the
next
day
folded
in
its
paper
and
slipped
for
safety
beneath
the
long
stitches
which
held
the
calico
cover
of
her
second
reader
then
hattie
explained
one
had
to
stay
head
a
whole
week
to
get
the
medal
emmy
lou
heart
was
heavy
the
more
that
she
had
now
seen
the
medal
it
was
a
silver
medal
that
said
merit
it
was
around
kitty
mckoeghany
neck
and
kitty
tossed
her
head
and
when
at
recess
she
ran
the
medal
swung
to
and
fro
on
its
ribbon
and
the
big
girls
all
stopped
kitty
to
look
at
the
medal
there
was
a
condition
attached
to
the
gaining
of
the
medal
upon
receiving
it
one
had
to
go
foot
but
that
mattered
little
to
kitty
mckoeghany
kitty
climbed
right
up
again
and
emmy
lou
peeped
surreptitiously
at
the
blue
ribbon
in
her
second
reader
and
at
home
she
placed
her
dolls
in
line
and
spelt
the
back
lessons
faithfully
with
comfort
in
her
knowledge
of
them
and
the
old
battered
doll
dear
to
her
heart
wore
oftenest
a
medal
of
shining
tinfoil
for
even
hattie
in
one
of
kitty
off
weeks
had
won
the
medal
it
was
late
in
the
year
when
a
rumour
ran
around
the
second
reader
room
the
trustees
were
coming
that
day
to
visit
the
school
illustration
emmy
lou
spelled
steadily
emmy
lou
wondered
what
trustees
were
she
asked
hattie
hattie
explained
they
are
men
in
black
clothes
you
dare
move
in
your
seat
they
something
like
ministers
hattie
knew
everything
will
they
come
here
in
our
room
asked
emmy
lou
it
was
terrible
to
be
at
the
front
desk
emmy
lou
remembered
the
music
man
he
still
pointed
his
bow
at
her
on
fridays
of
course
said
hattie
always
comes
to
our
room
which
was
true
for
dear
teacher
room
was
different
dear
room
seemed
always
ready
and
the
principal
brought
company
to
it
accordingly
it
was
after
recess
they
came
the
principal
the
trustee
there
was
just
one
trustee
and
a
visiting
gentleman
there
was
a
hush
as
they
filed
in
hattie
was
right
it
was
like
ministers
the
principal
was
in
black
with
a
white
tie
he
always
was
and
the
trustee
was
in
black
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
bowed
to
the
second
reader
class
sitting
very
straight
and
awed
and
the
visiting
gentleman
was
in
black
with
a
shiny
black
hat
the
trustee
was
a
big
man
and
his
face
was
red
and
when
urged
by
the
principal
to
address
the
second
reader
class
his
face
grew
redder
the
trustee
waved
his
hand
toward
the
visiting
gentleman
hammel
children
the
hon
samuel
hammel
a
citizen
with
whose
name
you
are
all
i
am
sure
familiar
and
then
the
trustee
mopping
his
face
got
behind
the
visiting
gentleman
and
the
principal
the
visiting
gentleman
stood
forth
he
was
a
short
little
man
a
little
round
man
whose
feet
were
so
far
back
beneath
a
preponderating
circumference
of
waist
line
that
he
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
one
of
uncle
charlie
pouter
pigeons
he
was
a
little
man
and
he
held
out
his
fat
hand
playfully
and
in
it
a
shining
white
box
dear
teacher
seemed
taller
and
very
far
off
she
looked
as
she
did
the
day
she
told
the
class
they
were
to
have
a
medal
emmy
lou
watched
dear
teacher
anxiously
something
told
her
dear
teacher
was
troubled
the
visiting
gentleman
began
to
speak
he
called
the
second
reader
class
dear
children
and
mothers
of
a
coming
generation
and
moulders
of
the
future
welfare
the
second
reader
class
sat
very
still
there
seemed
to
be
something
paralysing
to
their
infant
faculties
mental
and
physical
in
learning
they
were
mothers
and
moulders
but
emmy
lou
breathed
freer
to
have
it
applied
impartially
and
not
to
the
front
seat
their
country
the
pillars
of
state
everything
it
seemed
depended
on
the
way
in
which
these
mothers
learned
their
second
readers
as
mothers
and
moulders
they
must
learn
now
in
youth
to
read
to
number
to
spell
exactly
to
spell
and
the
visiting
gentleman
nodded
meaningly
tapped
the
white
box
and
looked
smilingly
about
the
mothers
moved
uneasily
the
smile
they
avoided
but
they
wondered
what
was
in
the
box
the
visiting
gentleman
lifted
the
lid
and
displayed
a
glittering
shining
something
on
a
bed
of
pink
cotton
then
as
if
struck
by
a
happy
thought
he
turned
to
the
blackboard
he
looked
about
for
chalk
the
principal
supplied
him
fashioned
by
his
fat
white
hand
these
words
sprawled
themselves
upon
the
blackboard
the
best
speller
in
this
room
is
to
recieve
this
medal
there
was
silence
then
the
second
reader
class
moved
it
breathed
a
long
breath
a
whisper
went
around
the
room
while
dear
teacher
and
the
gentleman
were
conferring
rumour
said
kitty
mckoeghany
started
it
certainly
kitty
in
her
desk
across
the
aisle
from
hattie
in
the
sight
of
all
tossed
her
black
head
knowingly
the
whisper
concerned
the
visiting
gentleman
he
is
running
for
trustee
said
the
whisper
emmy
lou
wondered
hattie
seemed
to
understand
he
puts
his
name
up
on
and
fences
she
whispered
to
emmy
lou
and
that
running
for
trustee
the
rumour
was
succeeded
by
another
he
running
against
the
trustee
that
not
here
no
wonder
kitty
mckoeghany
was
head
the
extent
of
kitty
knowledge
was
boundless
the
third
confidence
was
freighted
with
strange
import
it
came
straight
from
kitty
to
hattie
who
told
it
to
emmy
lou
when
he
trustee
he
means
the
school
board
shall
take
his
pork
house
for
the
new
school
even
emmy
lou
knew
the
pork
house
which
had
built
itself
unpleasantly
near
the
neighbourhood
just
then
the
second
reader
class
was
summoned
to
the
bench
as
the
line
took
its
place
a
hush
fell
emmy
lou
at
its
foot
looked
up
its
length
and
wondered
how
it
would
seem
to
be
kitty
mckoeghany
at
the
head
the
three
gentlemen
were
looking
at
kitty
too
kitty
tossed
her
head
kitty
was
used
to
being
looked
at
because
of
being
head
the
low
words
of
the
gentleman
reached
the
foot
of
the
line
the
head
one
that
mckoeghany
little
girl
it
was
the
trustee
telling
the
visiting
gentleman
emmy
lou
did
not
wonder
that
kitty
was
being
pointed
out
kitty
was
head
but
emmy
lou
did
not
know
that
it
was
because
kitty
was
michael
mckoeghany
little
girl
that
she
was
being
pointed
out
as
well
as
because
she
was
head
for
michael
mckoeghany
was
the
political
boss
of
a
district
known
as
limerick
and
by
the
vote
of
limerick
a
man
running
for
office
could
stand
or
fall
now
there
were
many
things
unknown
to
emmy
lou
about
which
kitty
being
the
little
girl
of
michael
mckoeghany
could
have
enlightened
her
kitty
could
have
told
her
that
the
yard
of
the
absent
trustee
ran
back
to
the
pork
house
also
that
the
trustee
present
was
part
owner
of
that
offending
building
and
further
that
emmy
lou
uncle
charlie
leading
an
irate
neighbourhood
to
battle
had
compelled
the
withdrawal
of
the
obnoxious
business
but
to
emmy
lou
only
one
thing
was
clear
kitty
was
being
pointed
out
by
the
principal
and
the
trustee
to
the
visiting
gentleman
because
she
was
head
dear
teacher
took
the
book
she
stood
on
the
platform
apart
from
the
gentlemen
and
gave
out
the
words
distinctly
but
very
quietly
emmy
lou
felt
that
dear
teacher
was
troubled
emmy
lou
thought
it
was
because
dear
teacher
was
afraid
the
poor
spellers
were
going
to
miss
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
miss
dear
teacher
began
with
the
words
on
the
first
page
and
went
forward
emmy
lou
could
tell
the
next
word
to
come
each
time
for
she
knew
her
second
reader
by
heart
as
far
as
the
class
had
gone
she
stood
up
when
her
time
came
and
spelled
her
word
her
word
was
wrong
she
spelled
it
right
dear
teacher
looked
pleased
there
was
a
time
when
emmy
lou
had
been
given
to
leaving
off
the
introductory
w
as
superfluous
on
the
next
round
a
little
girl
above
emmy
lou
missed
on
enough
to
her
phonetic
understanding
a
and
two
were
equivalent
to
an
emmy
lou
spelled
it
right
and
went
up
one
the
little
girl
went
to
her
seat
she
was
no
longer
in
the
race
she
was
in
tears
presently
a
little
girl
far
up
the
line
arose
to
spell
right
to
do
right
said
dear
teacher
right
said
the
little
girl
promptly
right
said
the
next
little
girl
the
third
stood
up
with
triumph
preassured
in
spelling
the
complicated
is
the
surest
reasoned
this
little
girl
right
spelled
the
certain
little
girl
then
burst
into
tears
the
mothers
of
the
future
grew
demoralised
the
pillars
of
state
of
english
orthography
at
least
seemed
destined
to
totter
the
spelling
grew
wild
right
right
then
in
the
desperation
of
sheer
hopelessness
came
right
again
there
were
tears
all
along
the
line
at
their
wits
end
the
mothers
dissolving
as
they
rose
in
turn
shook
their
heads
hopelessly
emmy
lou
stood
up
she
knew
just
where
the
word
was
in
a
column
of
three
on
page
she
could
see
it
she
looked
up
at
dear
teacher
quiet
and
pale
on
the
platform
r
said
emmy
lou
steadily
right
a
long
line
of
weeping
mothers
went
to
their
seats
and
emmy
lou
moved
up
past
the
middle
of
the
bench
the
words
were
now
more
complicated
the
nerves
of
the
mothers
had
been
shaken
by
this
last
strain
little
girls
dropped
out
rapidly
the
foot
moved
on
up
toward
the
head
until
there
came
a
pink
spot
on
dear
teacher
either
cheek
for
some
reason
dear
teacher
head
began
to
hold
itself
finely
erect
again
beaux
said
dear
teacher
the
little
girl
next
the
head
stood
up
she
missed
she
burst
into
audible
weeping
nerves
were
giving
out
along
the
line
it
went
wildly
down
emmy
lou
was
the
last
emmy
lou
stood
up
it
was
the
first
word
of
a
column
on
page
emmy
lou
could
see
it
she
looked
at
dear
teacher
b
said
emmy
lou
beaux
the
intervening
mothers
had
gone
to
their
seats
and
kitty
and
emmy
lou
were
left
kitty
spelled
triumphantly
emmy
lou
spelled
steadily
even
dear
teacher
voice
showed
a
touch
of
the
strain
she
gave
out
half
a
dozen
words
then
receive
said
dear
teacher
it
was
kitty
turn
kitty
stood
up
dear
teacher
back
was
to
the
blackboard
the
trustee
and
the
visiting
gentleman
were
also
facing
the
class
kitty

as
she
stood
up

on
the
board
the
best
speller
in
this
room

medal
was
the
assurance
on
the
board
kitty
tossed
her
little
head
re
ceive

kitty
her
eyes
on
the
blackboard
wrong
emmy
lou
stood
up
it
was
the
second
word
in
a
column
on
a
picture
page
emmy
lou
could
see
it
she
looked
at
dear
teacher
re
ceive

said
emmy
lou
one
person
beside
kitty
had
noted
the
blackboard
already
the
principal
was
passing
an
eraser
across
the
words
of
the
visiting
gentleman
dear
teacher
cheeks
were
pink
as
emmy
lou
as
she
led
emmy
lou
to
receive
the
medal
and
her
head
was
finely
erect
she
held
emmy
hand
through
it
all
the
visiting
gentleman
manner
was
a
little
stony
it
had
quite
lost
its
playfulness
he
looked
almost
gloomily
on
the
mother
who
had
upheld
the
pillars
of
state
and
the
future
generally
it
was
a
beautiful
medal
it
was
a
star
it
said
reward
of
merit
the
visiting
gentleman
lifted
it
from
its
bed
of
pink
cotton
you
must
get
a
ribbon
for
it
said
dear
teacher
emmy
lou
slipped
her
hand
from
dear
teacher
she
went
to
the
front
desk
she
got
her
second
reader
and
brought
forth
a
folded
packet
from
behind
the
stitches
holding
the
cover
then
she
came
back
she
put
the
paper
in
dear
teacher
hand
there
a
ribbon
said
emmy
lou
they
were
at
dinner
when
emmy
lou
got
home
on
a
blue
ribbon
around
her
neck
dangled
a
new
medal
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
shiny
box
even
uncle
charlie
felt
there
must
be
some
mistake
aunt
louise
got
her
hat
to
hurry
emmy
lou
right
back
to
school
at
the
gate
they
met
dear
teacher
carriage
taking
dear
teacher
home
she
stopped
aunt
cordelia
came
out
and
aunt
katie
uncle
charlie
just
going
stopped
to
hear
spelling
match
said
aunt
louise
not
our
emmy
lou
said
aunt
katie
the
precious
baby
said
aunt
cordelia
hammel
said
uncle
charlie
mckoeghany
and
uncle
charlie
smote
his
thigh
i
sing
of
honour
and
the
faithful
heart
the
real
teacher
was
sick
the
third
reader
was
to
begin
its
duties
with
a
substitute
the
principal
announced
it
to
the
class
looking
at
them
coldly
and
stating
the
matter
curtly
it
was
as
though
he
considered
the
third
reader
class
to
blame
somehow
emmy
lou
felt
apologetic
about
it
and
guilty
and
she
watched
the
door
a
substitute
might
mean
anything
hattie
emmy
watched
the
door
too
but
covertly
for
hattie
did
not
like
to
acknowledge
she
did
not
know
illustration
hattie
peeped
out
from
behind
the
shed
the
substitute
came
in
a
little
breathlessly
she
was
pretty
as
pretty
as
emmy
lou
aunt
katie
she
seemed
a
little
uncertain
as
to
what
to
do
perhaps
she
felt
conscious
of
forty
pairs
of
eyes
waiting
to
see
what
she
would
do
the
substitute
stepped
hesitatingly
up
on
the
platform
she
gripped
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
opened
her
lips
but
nothing
came
she
closed
them
and
swallowed
then
she
said
children
she
goin
to
cry
whispered
hattie
in
awed
accents
emmy
lou
felt
it
would
be
terrible
to
see
her
cry
it
was
evidently
something
so
unpleasant
to
be
a
substitute
that
emmy
lou
heart
went
out
to
her
but
the
substitute
did
not
cry
she
still
gripped
the
desk
and
after
a
moment
went
on
you
will
find
printed
on
the
slips
of
paper
upon
each
desk
the
needs
of
the
third
reader
she
did
not
cry
but
everybody
felt
the
tremor
in
her
voice
the
substitute
was
young
and
new
to
her
business
reading
over
the
needs
of
the
third
reader
printed
on
the
slips
of
paper
emmy
lou
found
them
so
complicated
and
lengthy
she
realised
one
thing
she
would
have
to
have
a
new
a
larger
stronger
one
to
accommodate
them
now
there
is
a
difference
between
a
real
teacher
and
a
substitute
the
real
teacher
loves
mystery
and
explains
grudgingly
the
real
teacher
stands
aloof
with
awe
and
distance
between
herself
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
rows
of
desks
she
holds
dominion
over
but
a
substitute
tells
the
class
all
about
her
duty
and
its
duty
and
about
what
she
is
planning
and
what
she
expects
of
them
a
substitute
makes
the
occupants
of
the
desks
feel
flattered
and
conscious
and
important
the
substitute
name
was
miss
jenny
the
class
speedily
adored
her
soon
her
desk
might
have
been
a
shrine
to
pomona
it
was
joy
to
forego
one
apple
to
swell
the
fruitage
of
adoration
piled
on
miss
desk
the
class
could
scarcely
be
driven
to
recess
since
going
tore
them
from
her
they
found
their
happiness
in
miss
jenny
presence
so
apparently
did
bryan
bryan
was
the
principal
he
wore
his
black
hair
somewhat
long
and
thrown
off
his
forehead
only
bryan
would
have
called
it
brow
bryan
came
often
to
the
third
reader
room
he
said
it
was
very
necessary
that
the
third
reader
should
be
well
grounded
in
the
rudiments
of
number
he
said
he
was
astonished
he
was
appalled
he
was
chagrined
he
paused
at
chagrined
and
repeated
it
impressively
so
that
the
guttural
grimness
of
its
second
syllable
sounded
most
unpleasant
appalled
and
astonished
must
be
bad
but
to
be
chagrined
as
bryan
said
it
must
be
terrible
he
was
chagrined
so
it
proved
that
a
class
could
show
such
deplorable
ignorance
concerning
the
very
rudiments
of
number
it
was
emmy
lou
who
displayed
it
when
she
was
called
to
the
blackboard
by
bryan
he
called
a
different
little
girl
each
day
with
discriminating
impartiality
when
doing
so
bryan
would
often
express
a
hope
that
his
teachers
would
have
no
favourites
emmy
lou
went
to
the
board
if
a
man
born
in
eighteen
hundred
and
nine
lives
began
bryan
then
he
turned
to
speak
to
miss
jenny
emmy
lou
took
the
chalk
and
stood
on
her
toes
to
reach
the
board
illustration
while
the
children
drew
bryan
would
lean
on
miss
jenny
desk
rearrange
his
white
necktie
and
talk
to
miss
jenny
set
it
down
said
bryan
turning
the
date
emmy
lou
paused
uncertain
had
he
said
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
nine
she
would
have
known
that
was
the
way
one
knew
it
in
the
second
reader
but
eighteen
hundred
was
confusing
again
bryan
looked
around
to
see
the
chubby
little
girl
standing
on
her
toes
chalk
in
hand
still
uncertain
bryan
voice
expressed
tried
but
laudable
patience
put
it
down
the
date
said
bryan
eighteen
hundred
and
nine
emmy
lou
put
it
down
she
put
it
down
in
this
way
then
it
was
he
was
astonished
appalled
chagrined
then
it
was
he
found
it
would
be
necessary
to
come
even
oftener
to
the
third
reader
to
ground
it
in
the
rudiments
of
number
but
he
did
not
always
go
when
the
lesson
ended
directly
following
its
work
in
the
new
eclectic
practical
and
mental
primary
arithmetic
the
class
was
given
over
to
mastering
townsend
new
system
of
drawing
illustration
and
she
like
townsend
had
her
system
while
the
children
drew
bryan
would
lean
on
miss
jenny
desk
rearrange
his
white
necktie
and
talk
to
her
miss
jenny
was
pretty
the
class
gloried
in
her
prettiness
but
it
felt
it
would
have
her
more
for
its
own
if
bryan
would
go
when
the
number
lesson
ended
townsend
may
have
made
much
of
the
system
he
claimed
was
embodied
in
book
no
but
the
class
never
tried
his
system
there
is
a
chance
miss
jenny
had
not
tried
it
either
drawing
had
never
been
in
the
public
school
before
and
miss
jenny
was
only
a
substitute
so
the
class
drew
with
no
supervision
and
with
only
such
verbal
direction
as
miss
jenny
could
insert
between
bryan
attentions
miss
jenny
seemed
different
when
bryan
was
there
she
seemed
helpless
and
nervous
emmy
lou
felt
reasonably
safe
when
it
came
to
drawing
she
had
often
copied
pictures
out
of
books
and
she
like
townsend
had
her
system
on
the
first
page
of
book
no
were
six
lines
up
and
down
six
lines
across
six
slanting
lines
and
a
circle
one
was
expected
to
copy
these
in
the
space
below
to
do
this
emmy
lou
applied
her
system
she
produced
a
piece
of
folded
away
in
her
montague
new
elementary
geography
emmy
lou
was
a
saving
and
hoarding
little
soul
which
she
laid
over
the
lines
and
traced
them
with
her
pencil
it
was
harder
to
do
the
rest
next
she
laid
the
traced
paper
carefully
over
the
space
below
and
taking
her
went
laboriously
over
each
line
with
an
absorbing
zeal
that
left
its
mark
in
the
soft
drawing
paper
lastly
she
went
over
each
indented
line
with
a
carefully
and
frequently
wetted
in
her
little
mouth
miss
jenny
exclaimed
when
she
saw
it
bryan
had
gone
miss
jenny
said
it
was
the
best
page
in
the
room
emmy
lou
could
not
take
her
book
home
for
must
be
kept
clean
and
were
collected
and
kept
in
the
cupboard
but
she
told
aunt
cordelia
that
her
page
had
been
the
best
in
the
room
aunt
cordelia
could
hardly
believe
it
saying
she
had
never
heard
of
a
talent
for
drawing
in
any
branch
of
the
family
now
hattie
had
taken
note
of
emmy
lou
system
in
drawing
and
the
next
day
she
brought
that
day
miss
jenny
praised
page
emmy
lou
system
immediately
became
popular
all
the
class
got
and
bryan
finding
the
one
of
undisturbed
opportunity
stayed
until
the
bell
rang
for
geography
a
little
girl
named
sadie
wondered
if
was
fair
hattie
said
it
was
for
bryan
saw
her
using
it
and
turned
and
went
on
talking
to
miss
jenny
but
a
little
girl
named
mamie
settled
it
definitely
did
not
her
mamma
mamie
wanted
to
know
draw
the
scallops
that
way
on
baby
sister
flannel
petticoat
and
did
one
own
mamma
know
sadie
was
reassured
sadie
was
a
conscientious
little
girl
miss
jenny
said
so
miss
jenny
was
conscientious
too
right
at
the
beginning
she
told
them
how
she
hated
a
story
she
meant
the
class
felt
that
they
too
abhorred
stories
they
loved
miss
jenny
and
miss
jenny
disliked
stories
just
then
a
little
girl
raised
her
hand
it
was
sadie
sadie
said
she
was
afraid
she
had
told
miss
jenny
a
story
a
the
day
before
when
miss
jenny
had
asked
her
if
she
felt
the
wind
from
the
window
opened
above
and
she
had
said
no
afterward
she
had
realised
she
did
feel
the
wind
a
thrill
went
around
the
room
in
her
secret
soul
every
little
girl
wished
she
had
told
a
story
that
she
might
tell
miss
jenny
miss
jenny
praised
sadie
she
called
her
a
brave
and
conscientious
little
girl
she
closed
the
book
and
came
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
talked
to
them
about
duty
and
honour
and
faithfulness
emmy
lou
her
cheeks
pink
longed
for
opportunity
to
prove
her
faithfulness
her
honesty
she
longed
to
prove
herself
a
sadie
there
was
roll
call
in
the
third
reader
the
duties
were
much
too
complicated
for
mere
head
and
foot
after
each
lesson
came
roll
call
as
emmy
lou
understood
them
the
marks
by
which
one
graded
performance
and
deserts
in
the
third
reader
were
interpreted
the
final
state
which
few
may
hope
to
attain
the
gate
beyond
which
lies
the
final
and
unattainable
state
the
highest
hope
of
the
humble
the
common
condition
of
mankind
the
just
reward
of
the
wretched
the
badge
of
shame
outer
darkness
when
roll
call
first
began
miss
jenny
said
to
her
class
you
must
each
think
earnestly
before
answering
to
give
in
a
mark
above
what
you
feel
yourself
entitled
is
to
tell
worse
than
a
story
it
is
to
tell
a
falsehood
and
a
falsehood
is
a
lie
i
shall
leave
it
to
you
i
believe
in
trusting
my
pupils
and
i
shall
take
no
note
of
your
standing
each
will
be
answerable
for
herself
miss
jenny
was
very
young
the
class
sat
weighted
with
the
awfulness
of
the
responsibility
it
was
a
conscientious
class
and
miss
jenny
high
ideals
had
worked
upon
its
sensibilities
no
little
girl
dared
to
be
six
how
could
she
know
for
instance
in
her
reading
lesson
if
she
had
paused
the
exact
length
of
a
full
stop
every
time
she
met
with
a
period
who
could
decide
certainly
not
the
little
girl
in
her
own
favour
and
perhaps
be
branded
with
a
falsehood
which
was
a
lie
or
who
when
roll
call
for
deportment
came
could
ever
dare
call
herself
perfect
and
inward
analysis
lead
rather
to
a
belief
in
natural
sin
the
third
reader
class
grew
conscientious
to
the
splitting
of
a
hair
it
was
better
to
be
four
than
five
and
be
saved
and
three
than
four
if
there
was
room
for
doubt
class
standing
fell
rapidly
emmy
lou
struggled
to
keep
up
with
the
downward
tendency
hattie
outstripped
her
promptly
hattie
could
adapt
herself
to
all
exigencies
emmy
lou
even
felt
envy
of
hattie
creeping
into
her
heart
there
came
an
awful
day
it
was
roll
call
for
drawing
it
had
been
a
fish
a
fish
with
elaborately
serrated
fins
miss
jenny
had
said
that
emmy
lou
fish
was
as
good
as
the
copy
in
her
heart
miss
jenny
wondered
at
the
proficiency
of
her
class
in
drawing
for
she
could
not
draw
a
straight
line
but
since
bryan
seemed
satisfied
and
said
every
day
let
them
alone
they
are
getting
along
miss
jenny
gave
the
credit
to
townsend
system
she
was
enthusiastic
over
emmy
lou
fish
which
emmy
lou
brought
up
as
soon
as
bryan
departed
it
is
wonderful
said
miss
jenny
it
is
perfect
emmy
lou
went
back
to
her
desk
much
troubled
what
was
she
to
do
she
had
not
moved
she
had
not
whispered
she
had
not
lifted
the
lashes
sweeping
her
chubby
cheeks
even
to
look
at
hattie
yet
it
was
the
general
belief
that
no
little
girl
could
answer
six
and
not
tell
a
falsehood
which
is
a
lie
yet
on
the
other
hand
being
perfect
emmy
lou
could
not
say
less
she
was
perfect
miss
jenny
said
so
emmy
lou
shut
her
eyes
to
think
it
was
approaching
her
turn
to
answer
six
said
emmy
lou
opening
her
eyes
and
standing
the
impersonation
of
conscious
guilt
she
felt
disgraced
she
felt
the
silence
she
felt
she
could
not
meet
the
eyes
of
the
other
little
girls
and
she
felt
sick
her
throat
was
sore
in
the
third
reader
one
face
burned
from
the
stove
so
near
by
while
one
shivered
from
the
draught
when
the
window
was
lowered
above
one
head
emmy
lou
did
not
come
to
school
the
next
day
so
hattie
went
out
to
see
her
it
was
friday
the
class
had
had
singing
every
friday
the
singing
teacher
came
to
the
third
reader
for
an
hour
he
changed
my
seat
over
to
the
left
said
hattie
i
can
sing
alto
emmy
lou
felt
cross
she
felt
the
strenuousness
of
striving
to
keep
abreast
of
hattie
and
the
taste
of
a
nauseous
dose
from
a
black
bottle
was
in
her
mouth
and
another
dose
loomed
an
hour
ahead
and
now
hattie
could
sing
alto
sing
it
said
emmy
lou
it
disconcerted
hattie
it
is
er
you
ca
just
up
and
sing
it
it
alto
said
hattie
nonplussed
you
said
you
could
sing
it
said
emmy
lou
this
was
the
nearest
emmy
lou
had
come
to
fussing
with
hattie
the
next
monday
emmy
lou
was
late
in
starting
that
is
late
for
emmy
lou
and
she
made
a
discovery
miss
jenny
passed
emmy
lou
house
going
to
school
emmy
lou
did
not
have
courage
to
join
her
but
waited
inside
her
gate
until
miss
jenny
had
passed
but
the
next
morning
she
was
at
her
gate
again
as
miss
jenny
came
by
miss
jenny
said
good
morning
emmy
lou
went
out
they
walked
along
together
after
that
emmy
lou
waited
every
morning
one
day
it
was
icy
on
the
pavements
miss
jenny
told
emmy
lou
to
take
her
hand
after
that
emmy
lou
mittened
hand
went
into
miss
jenny
every
morning
emmy
lou
told
hattie
who
came
out
to
emmy
lou
the
next
morning
they
both
waited
for
miss
jenny
they
each
held
a
hand
it
was
in
this
way
they
came
to
know
the
man
sometimes
he
waited
for
them
at
the
corner
sometimes
he
walked
out
to
meet
them
he
and
miss
jenny
seemed
to
be
old
friends
he
asked
them
about
rudiments
of
number
they
wondered
how
he
knew
one
day
hattie
proposed
a
plan
it
was
daring
she
persuaded
emmy
lou
to
agree
to
it
that
night
emmy
lou
packed
her
even
to
the
apple
for
miss
jenny
next
morning
early
as
hattie
arrived
she
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
gate
though
hot
and
cold
with
the
daring
of
the
expedition
they
were
going
to
walk
out
in
the
direction
of
the
great
unknown
from
which
each
day
miss
jenny
emerged
they
were
going
to
meet
miss
jenny
they
knew
she
turned
into
their
street
at
the
corner
so
they
turned
at
the
next
corner
they
saw
miss
jenny
coming
but
along
the
intersecting
street
one
walking
southward
one
northward
toward
the
corner
where
hattie
emmy
lou
and
miss
jenny
were
about
to
meet
came
two
others
bryan
and
the
man
something
made
emmy
lou
and
hattie
feel
queer
and
guilty
something
made
them
turn
and
run
they
ran
fast
they
ran
faster
emmy
lou
heavy
thumped
against
her
little
calves
her
apple
flew
out
emmy
lou
never
stopped
hattie
told
her
afterward
that
it
was
the
man
who
brought
miss
jenny
to
school
hattie
peeped
out
from
behind
the
shed
where
the
sat
she
said
he
brought
miss
jenny
to
the
gate
and
opened
it
for
her
he
had
never
come
farther
than
the
corner
before
that
day
bryan
did
not
come
to
ground
them
in
the
rudiments
of
number
nor
did
he
come
the
next
day
nor
ever
any
more
yet
the
third
reader
class
was
undoubtedly
poor
in
arithmetic
miss
jenny
found
that
out
bryan
instruction
seemed
not
to
have
helped
them
at
all
miss
jenny
said
that
as
they
were
so
well
up
in
drawing
they
would
lay
those
books
aside
and
give
that
time
to
arithmetic
and
she
also
reminded
them
to
be
conscientious
in
all
their
work
they
were
and
the
roll
call
bore
witness
to
their
rigourous
bryan
never
came
for
number
again
but
he
came
one
day
because
of
roll
call
once
a
week
roll
call
was
sent
to
the
office
it
was
called
their
class
average
the
day
of
class
average
bryan
walked
in
he
rapped
smartly
on
the
red
and
blue
lined
paper
in
his
hand
miss
class
average
so
the
class
learned
was
low
and
she
must
see
to
it
that
her
class
made
a
better
showing
she
was
a
substitute
bryan
recognised
that
and
made
allowance
accordingly
but
then
he
went
illustration
the
third
reader
class
gathered
in
knots
miss
jenny
looked
frightened
the
class
feared
she
was
going
to
cry
they
determined
to
be
better
and
more
conscientious
for
her
sake
feeling
that
they
would
die
for
miss
jenny
but
the
class
average
was
low
again
how
could
it
be
otherwise
with
forty
little
consciences
determining
their
own
deserts
one
day
miss
jenny
was
sent
for
when
one
was
sent
for
one
went
to
the
office
little
boys
went
there
to
be
whipped
sadie
went
there
once
her
grandma
was
dead
and
they
had
sent
for
her
miss
jenny
had
been
crying
when
she
came
back
lessons
went
on
miserably
then
miss
jenny
put
the
book
down
it
was
evident
she
had
not
heard
one
word
of
the
and
sympathetic
little
girl
who
said
that
a
peninsula
was
a
body
of
water
almost
surrounded
by
land
miss
jenny
came
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
she
looked
way
off
a
moment
then
she
looked
at
the
class
and
spoke
she
said
she
was
going
to
take
them
into
her
confidence
miss
jenny
was
very
young
she
told
them
the
teacher
of
the
third
reader
the
real
teacher
was
not
coming
back
and
that
she
had
hoped
to
take
the
real
teacher
place
but
the
class
average
was
being
counted
against
her
everybody
noticed
the
tremor
in
miss
jenny
voice
it
broke
on
the
fatal
class
average
sadie
began
to
cry
illustration
to
use
would
be
cheating
miss
jenny
came
to
the
very
edge
of
the
platform
she
looked
slight
and
young
and
appealing
did
miss
jenny
next
week
she
went
on
to
tell
them
would
be
quarterly
examination
if
they
did
well
in
examination
even
with
the
class
average
against
her
miss
jenny
might
be
allowed
to
remain
but
if
they
failed
the
third
reader
class
gathered
in
knots
and
groups
at
recess
it
depended
on
them
whether
miss
jenny
went
or
stayed
emmy
lou
stood
in
one
of
the
groups
her
chubby
face
bearing
witness
to
her
concern
what
is
a
quarterly
examination
asked
emmy
lou
nobody
seemed
very
sure
oh
said
another
little
girl
they
give
you
questions
and
you
write
down
answers
my
brother
is
in
the
grammar
school
and
he
has
examinations
quarterly
examinations
asked
emmy
lou
who
was
definite
the
little
girl
did
not
know
she
only
knew
if
you
answered
right
you
passed
if
wrong
you
failed
and
miss
jenny
would
go
illustration
miss
jenny
was
throwing
a
kiss
to
the
third
reader
class
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
about
a
quarterly
examination
it
made
one
uneasy
before
the
actual
thing
came
while
the
uncertainty
concerning
it
was
trying
to
the
nerves
the
day
before
examination
miss
jenny
told
every
little
girl
to
clear
out
her
desk
and
carry
all
her
belongings
home
then
she
went
around
and
looked
in
each
desk
for
not
a
scrap
of
paper
even
must
remain
miss
jenny
told
them
that
she
trusted
them
it
was
not
that
it
was
because
it
was
the
rule
to
cheat
at
examination
said
miss
jenny
is
worse
even
than
to
lie
to
cheat
is
to
steal
steal
knowledge
that
does
belong
to
you
to
cheat
at
examination
is
to
be
both
a
liar
and
a
thief
the
class
scarcely
breathed
this
was
terrible
about
the
first
subject
said
miss
jenny
i
feel
safe
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
you
will
be
examined
in
drawing
emmy
lou
at
that
remembered
she
had
no
neither
had
hattie
neither
had
mamie
everybody
must
be
reminded
miss
jenny
told
them
to
come
with
slate
pencils
and
paper
after
school
emmy
lou
and
hattie
and
sadie
and
mamie
made
mention
of
the
man
waited
on
emmy
lou
the
next
morning
emmy
lou
had
a
nickel
she
wanted
the
man
was
curious
it
seemed
as
if
every
little
girl
who
came
in
wanted
emmy
lou
and
the
man
were
great
friends
what
it
got
to
do
with
rudiments
of
number
asked
the
man
it
for
drawing
said
emmy
lou
it
quarterly
examination
the
man
was
interested
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
system
emmy
lou
explained
her
chin
did
not
reach
the
counter
but
she
looked
up
and
he
leaned
over
the
man
grew
serious
he
was
afraid
this
might
get
miss
jenny
into
trouble
he
explained
to
emmy
lou
that
it
would
be
cheating
to
use
in
examination
and
told
her
she
must
draw
right
off
the
copy
according
to
the
directions
set
down
in
the
book
he
suggested
that
she
go
and
tell
the
others
of
the
class
for
that
matter
if
they
came
right
over
he
would
take
back
the
and
substitute
licorice
sticks
emmy
lou
hurried
over
to
tell
them
examinations
she
explained
were
different
and
to
use
would
be
cheating
and
what
would
miss
jenny
say
little
girls
hurried
across
the
street
and
the
jar
of
licorice
was
exhausted
miss
jenny
saw
them
seated
she
told
them
she
could
trust
them
no
one
in
her
class
would
cheat
then
a
strange
teacher
from
the
class
above
came
in
to
examine
them
it
was
the
rule
and
miss
jenny
was
sent
away
to
examine
a
primary
school
in
another
district
but
at
the
door
she
turned
every
eye
was
following
her
they
loved
miss
jenny
her
cheeks
were
glowing
and
the
draught
as
miss
jenny
stood
in
the
open
doorway
blew
her
hair
about
her
face
she
smiled
back
at
them
she
turned
to
go
but
again
she
turned
miss
jenny
yes
miss
jenny
was
throwing
a
kiss
to
the
third
reader
class
the
door
closed
it
was
examination
the
page
they
were
to
draw
had
for
copy
a
cup
and
saucer
no
worse
a
cup
in
a
saucer
and
by
it
was
a
and
next
to
that
was
a
and
these
were
to
be
drawn
for
quarterly
examination
without
when
emmy
lou
had
finished
she
felt
discouraged
in
the
result
one
might
be
pardoned
for
some
uncertainty
as
to
which
was
and
which
the
cup
and
saucer
seemed
strangely
like
a
circle
in
a
hole
there
was
a
yawning
break
in
the
paper
from
much
erasure
where
the
handle
of
the
should
have
been
there
were
thumb
marks
and
smears
where
nothing
should
have
been
emmy
lou
looked
at
hattie
hattie
looked
worn
out
she
had
her
book
upside
down
putting
the
holes
in
the
lid
of
the
sadie
was
crying
tears
were
dropping
right
down
on
the
page
of
her
book
the
bell
rang
examination
in
drawing
was
over
the
books
were
collected
just
as
the
teacher
was
dismissing
them
for
recess
she
opened
a
book
she
opened
another
she
turned
to
the
front
pages
she
passed
a
finger
over
the
reverse
side
of
a
page
she
was
a
teacher
of
long
years
of
experience
she
told
the
class
to
sit
down
she
asked
a
little
girl
named
mamie
sessum
to
please
rise
it
was
mamie
book
she
held
mamie
rose
the
teacher
tones
were
polite
it
made
one
tremble
they
were
so
polite
may
i
ask
said
the
teacher
to
have
explained
the
system
by
which
the
supposedly
freehand
drawing
in
this
book
has
been
done
it
was
any
system
mamie
hastened
to
explain
anxious
to
disclaim
a
connection
evidently
so
undesirable
it
was
and
this
confessed
openly
to
my
face
said
the
teacher
she
was
even
after
many
years
at
the
business
of
exposing
the
natural
depravity
of
the
youthful
mind
appalled
at
the
brazenness
of
mamie
mamie
looked
uncertain
whatever
she
had
done
it
was
well
to
have
company
we
all
used
said
mamie
it
proved
even
so
the
teacher
that
this
thing
might
be
fully
exposed
called
the
roll
each
little
girl
responded
in
alphabetical
sequence
the
teacher
condition
of
shocked
virtue
rendered
her
coldly
laconic
she
asked
each
little
girl
in
turn
was
the
burden
if
not
the
form
of
every
alarmed
little
girl
reply
cipher
said
the
teacher
briefly
as
each
made
confession
and
called
the
next
o
outer
darkness
the
teacher
at
the
last
closed
her
book
with
a
snap
cipher
and
worse
she
told
them
you
are
cheats
and
to
cheat
is
to
lie
and
further
the
class
has
failed
in
drawing
a
bell
rang
recess
was
over
the
teacher
regarding
them
coldly
picked
up
the
chalk
and
turned
to
write
on
the
board
if
a
man
examination
in
new
eclectic
practical
and
mental
primary
arithmetic
had
begun
the
third
reader
class
stunned
picked
up
its
pencils
miss
jenny
had
feared
for
them
in
arithmetic
they
had
feared
for
themselves
they
were
cheats
and
liars
and
they
had
failed
and
the
knowledge
did
not
make
them
feel
confident
they
were
cheats
and
a
suspicious
and
cold
surveillance
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
kept
them
reminded
that
she
looked
upon
them
as
cheats
and
watched
them
accordingly
misery
and
despair
were
their
portion
and
further
failure
in
their
state
of
mind
it
was
inevitable
for
them
to
get
lost
in
the
maze
of
conditions
surrounding
if
a
man
they
did
better
next
day
in
geography
and
reading
they
passed
on
friday
in
spelling
and
penmanship
but
the
terrible
fact
remained
the
teacher
had
declared
them
cheats
and
liars
if
they
could
only
see
miss
jenny
miss
jenny
would
understand
miss
jenny
would
make
it
all
right
after
she
returned
when
the
third
reader
class
assembled
on
monday
a
tall
lady
occupied
the
platform
she
was
a
real
teacher
but
at
the
door
stood
a
memory
of
miss
jenny
the
hair
blown
about
her
face
kissing
her
hand
the
third
reader
class
never
saw
miss
jenny
again
the
play
the
thing
it
was
the
day
of
the
exhibition
at
close
of
the
half
year
the
third
reader
class
had
suffered
a
change
in
teachers
the
first
having
been
a
substitute
whereas
her
successor
was
a
real
teacher
and
since
the
coming
of
miss
carrie
the
third
reader
class
had
lived
as
it
were
in
the
public
eye
for
on
fridays
books
were
put
away
and
the
attention
given
to
recitations
and
company
miss
carrie
talked
in
deep
tones
which
she
said
were
chest
tones
and
described
mysterious
sweeps
and
circles
with
her
hands
when
she
talked
and
these
she
called
gestures
miss
carrie
was
an
elocutionist
and
had
even
recited
on
the
stage
she
gave
her
class
the
benefit
of
her
talent
and
in
teaching
them
said
they
must
suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
action
meant
gestures
and
gestures
meant
sweeps
and
circles
emmy
lou
had
to
learn
a
piece
for
friday
it
was
poetry
but
you
called
it
a
piece
and
though
uncle
charlie
had
selected
it
for
emmy
lou
miss
carrie
did
not
seem
to
think
much
of
it
emmy
lou
stood
up
miss
carrie
was
drilling
her
and
though
she
did
her
best
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
it
seemed
a
complicated
undertaking
the
piece
was
called
a
plain
direction
emmy
lou
came
to
the
lines
straight
down
the
crooked
lane
and
all
round
the
square
whatever
difficulties
her
plump
forefinger
had
had
over
the
first
three
of
these
geometrical
propositions
it
triumphed
at
the
end
for
emmy
lou
paused
a
square
has
four
sides
and
to
suit
a
action
to
the
word
takes
time
miss
carrie
whose
attention
had
wandered
a
little
here
suddenly
observing
stopped
her
saying
her
gestures
were
stiff
and
meaningless
she
said
they
looked
like
straight
lines
cut
in
the
air
emmy
lou
anxious
to
prove
her
efforts
to
be
conscientious
explained
that
they
were
straight
lines
it
was
a
square
miss
carrie
drew
herself
up
and
using
her
coldest
tones
told
emmy
lou
not
to
be
funny
funny
emmy
lou
felt
that
she
did
not
understand
but
this
was
a
mere
episode
between
fridays
one
lived
but
to
prepare
for
fridays
and
a
sunday
dress
was
becoming
a
mere
everyday
affair
since
one
best
must
be
worn
for
fridays
no
other
class
had
these
recitations
and
the
third
reader
was
envied
its
members
were
pointed
out
and
gazed
upon
until
one
realised
one
was
standing
in
the
garish
light
of
fame
the
other
readers
it
seemed
longed
for
fame
and
craved
publicity
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
school
was
to
have
an
exhibition
with
miss
carrie
genius
to
plan
and
engineer
the
whole
for
general
material
miss
carrie
drew
from
the
whole
school
but
the
play
was
for
her
own
class
alone
and
this
was
the
day
of
the
exhibition
hattie
and
sadie
and
emmy
lou
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
school
they
had
spent
the
morning
in
rehearsing
at
noon
they
had
been
sent
home
with
instructions
to
return
at
half
past
two
the
exhibition
would
begin
at
three
of
course
miss
carrie
had
said
you
will
not
fail
to
be
on
time
and
miss
carrie
had
used
her
deepest
tones
hattie
and
sadie
and
emmy
lou
had
wondered
how
she
could
even
dream
of
such
a
thing
it
was
not
two
and
the
three
stood
at
the
gate
the
first
to
return
they
were
in
the
same
piece
it
was
the
play
in
a
play
one
did
more
than
suit
the
action
to
the
word
one
dressed
to
suit
the
part
in
the
play
hattie
and
sadie
and
emmy
lou
found
themselves
the
orphaned
children
of
a
soldier
who
had
failed
to
return
from
the
war
it
was
a
very
sad
piece
sadie
had
to
weep
and
more
than
once
emmy
lou
had
found
tears
in
her
own
eyes
watching
her
miss
carrie
said
sadie
showed
histrionic
talent
emmy
lou
asked
hattie
about
it
who
said
it
meant
tears
and
emmy
lou
remembered
then
how
tears
came
naturally
to
sadie
when
aunt
cordelia
heard
they
must
dress
to
suit
the
part
she
came
to
see
miss
carrie
and
so
did
the
mamma
of
sadie
and
the
mamma
of
hattie
dress
them
in
a
kind
of
mild
mourning
miss
carrie
explained
not
too
deep
or
it
will
seem
too
real
and
as
three
little
sisters
suppose
we
dress
them
alike
and
now
hattie
and
sadie
and
emmy
lou
stood
at
the
gate
ready
for
the
play
stiffly
immaculate
white
dresses
with
beltings
of
black
sashes
flared
jauntily
out
above
spotless
white
stockings
and
sober
little
black
slippers
while
leghorn
hats
shaded
three
anxious
little
countenances
by
the
exact
centre
each
held
a
little
handkerchief
it
seems
almost
wicked
aunt
cordelia
had
ventured
at
this
point
it
seems
like
tempting
providence
but
sadie
mamma
did
not
see
it
so
sadie
mamma
had
provided
the
handkerchiefs
tears
were
sadie
feature
in
the
play
hattie
and
sadie
and
emmy
lou
wore
each
an
anxious
seriousness
of
countenance
but
it
was
a
variant
seriousness
hattie
tense
expression
breathed
a
determination
which
might
have
been
interpreted
do
or
die
to
hattie
life
was
a
battling
foe
to
be
overcome
and
trodden
beneath
a
victorious
heel
hattie
was
an
infantile
george
always
on
the
look
for
the
dragon
and
the
exhibition
was
the
dragon
sadie
seriousness
was
a
complacent
realization
of
large
responsibility
her
weeping
was
a
feature
sadie
remembered
she
had
histrionic
talent
emmy
lou
anxiety
was
because
there
loomed
ahead
the
awful
moment
of
mounting
the
platform
it
was
terrible
on
mere
fridays
to
mount
the
platform
and
after
vain
swallowing
to
overcome
a
labial
dryness
and
a
lingual
taste
of
copper
try
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
but
to
mount
the
platform
for
the
play
emmy
lou
was
trying
not
to
look
that
far
ahead
but
as
the
hour
approached
the
solemn
importance
of
the
occasion
was
stealing
brainward
and
she
even
began
to
feel
glad
she
was
a
part
of
the
exhibition
for
to
have
been
left
out
would
have
been
worse
even
than
the
moment
of
mounting
the
platform
my
brother
coming
said
hattie
an
my
mamma
an
an
the
rest
my
aunt
cordelia
has
invited
the
visiting
lady
next
door
said
emmy
lou
but
it
was
sadie
hour
our
minister
coming
said
sadie
oh
sadie
said
hattie
and
while
there
was
despair
in
her
voice
one
knew
that
in
hattie
heart
there
was
exultation
at
the
very
awfulness
of
it
oh
sadie
said
emmy
lou
and
there
was
no
exultation
in
the
tones
of
emmy
lou
despair
not
that
emmy
lou
had
much
to
do
hers
was
mostly
the
suiting
of
the
action
to
some
other
word
she
was
chosen
largely
because
of
hattie
and
sadie
who
had
wanted
her
and
then
too
emmy
lou
uncle
charlie
was
the
owner
of
a
newspaper
the
exhibition
might
get
into
its
columns
not
that
miss
carrie
cared
for
this
herself
she
was
thinking
of
the
good
it
might
do
the
school
emmy
lou
part
was
to
weep
when
sadie
wept
and
to
point
a
chubby
forefinger
skyward
when
hattie
mentioned
the
departure
from
earth
of
the
soldier
parent
and
to
lower
that
forefinger
footward
at
tearful
allusion
to
an
untimely
grave
emmy
lou
had
but
one
utterance
and
it
was
brief
emmy
lou
was
to
advance
one
foot
stretch
forth
a
hand
and
say
in
the
character
of
orphan
for
whom
no
asylum
was
offered
we
know
not
where
we
go
that
very
morning
at
gray
of
dawn
emmy
lou
had
crept
from
her
own
into
aunt
cordelia
bed
to
say
it
over
for
it
weighed
heavily
on
her
mind
we
know
not
where
we
go
as
emmy
lou
said
it
the
momentous
import
of
the
confession
fell
with
explosive
relief
on
the
as
if
the
relief
were
great
to
have
reached
that
point
it
seemed
to
aunt
cordelia
however
that
the
was
the
problem
in
the
matter
aunt
louise
called
in
from
the
next
room
aunt
louise
had
large
ideas
the
stress
she
said
should
be
laid
equally
on
and
since
then
all
day
emmy
lou
had
been
saying
it
at
intervals
of
half
minutes
for
fear
she
might
forget
meanwhile
it
yet
lacking
a
moment
or
so
to
two
the
orphaned
heroines
continued
to
linger
at
the
gate
awaiting
the
hour
listen
said
hattie
i
hear
music
there
was
a
church
across
the
street
the
adjoined
it
it
was
a
large
church
with
high
steps
and
a
pillared
portico
and
its
doors
were
open
it
a
band
and
marching
said
hattie
the
orphaned
children
hurried
to
the
curb
a
procession
was
turning
the
corner
and
coming
toward
them
on
either
sidewalk
crowds
of
men
and
boys
accompanied
it
it
a
funeral
said
sadie
as
if
she
intuitively
divined
the
mournful
hattie
turned
with
a
face
of
conviction
i
know
it
that
big
general
funeral
they
bringing
him
here
to
bury
him
with
the
soldiers
we
never
see
a
thing
for
the
crowd
despaired
sadie
emmy
lou
was
gazing
they
got
plumes
in
their
hats
she
said
let
go
over
on
the
church
steps
and
see
it
go
by
said
hattie
early
the
orphaned
children
hurried
across
the
street
they
climbed
the
steps
at
the
top
they
turned
there
were
plumes
and
more
there
were
flags
and
swords
and
a
band
led
but
at
the
church
with
unexpected
abruptness
the
band
halted
turned
it
fell
apart
and
the
procession
came
through
it
came
right
on
through
and
up
the
steps
a
line
of
uniforms
and
swords
on
either
side
from
curb
to
pillar
and
halted
aghast
between
two
glittering
files
the
orphaned
children
shrank
into
the
shadow
behind
a
pillar
while
upstreamed
from
the
carriages
below
an
unending
line
men
and
ladies
bearing
flowers
behind
below
about
closing
in
on
every
side
crowded
people
a
sea
of
people
the
orphaned
children
found
themselves
swept
from
their
hiding
by
the
crowd
and
unwillingly
jostled
forward
into
prominence
a
frowning
man
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
seemed
to
be
threatening
everybody
his
face
was
red
and
his
voice
was
big
and
he
glittered
with
many
buttons
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
the
orphaned
children
and
threatened
them
vehemently
here
said
the
frowning
man
right
in
here
and
he
placed
them
in
line
the
orphaned
children
were
appalled
and
even
in
the
face
of
the
man
cried
out
in
protest
but
the
man
of
the
sword
did
not
hear
for
the
reason
that
he
did
not
listen
instead
he
was
addressing
a
large
and
stout
lady
immediately
behind
them
separated
from
the
family
in
the
confusion
the
grandchildren
evidently
just
see
them
in
please
and
suddenly
the
orphaned
children
found
themselves
a
part
of
the
procession
as
grandchildren
the
nature
of
a
procession
is
to
proceed
and
the
grandchildren
proceeded
with
it
they
could
not
help
themselves
there
was
no
time
for
protest
for
pushed
by
the
crowd
which
closed
and
swayed
above
their
heads
and
piloted
by
the
stout
lady
close
behind
they
were
swept
into
the
church
and
up
the
aisle
and
when
they
came
again
to
themselves
were
in
the
inner
corner
of
a
pew
near
the
front
the
church
was
decked
with
flags
so
was
the
third
reader
room
it
was
hung
with
flags
for
the
exhibition
hattie
in
the
corner
nudged
sadie
sadie
urged
emmy
lou
who
next
to
the
stout
lady
touched
her
timidly
we
have
to
get
out
said
emmy
lou
we
got
to
say
our
parts
not
now
said
the
lady
reassuringly
the
programme
is
at
the
cemetery
emmy
lou
did
not
understand
and
she
tried
to
tell
the
lady
said
that
person
engaged
with
the
spectacle
and
the
crowd
abashed
emmy
lou
sat
hattie
arose
it
was
terrible
to
rise
in
church
and
at
a
funeral
and
the
church
was
filled
the
aisles
were
crowded
but
hattie
rose
hattie
was
a
george
and
a
dragon
stood
between
her
and
the
exhibition
she
pushed
by
sadie
and
past
emmy
lou
hattie
was
as
slim
as
she
was
strenuous
or
perhaps
she
was
slim
because
she
was
strenuous
but
not
even
so
slim
a
little
girl
as
hattie
could
push
by
the
stout
lady
for
she
filled
the
space
at
hattie
touch
she
turned
although
she
looked
the
size
and
ponderance
of
the
lady
were
intimidating
she
stared
at
hattie
people
were
looking
it
was
in
church
hattie
face
was
red
you
ca
get
to
the
family
said
the
lady
you
could
move
in
the
crowd
besides
i
promised
to
see
to
you
now
be
quiet
she
added
crossly
when
hattie
would
have
spoken
she
turned
away
hattie
crept
back
vanquished
by
this
dragon
so
suitably
dressed
the
stout
lady
was
saying
to
a
lady
beyond
grandchildren
you
know
she
says
they
are
grandchildren
echoed
the
whispers
around
even
their
little
handkerchiefs
have
black
borders
somebody
beyond
replied
emmy
lou
wondered
if
she
was
in
some
dreadful
dream
was
she
a
grandchild
or
was
she
an
orphan
her
head
swam
the
service
began
and
there
fell
on
the
unwilling
grandchildren
the
submission
of
awe
the
stout
lady
cried
she
also
punched
emmy
lou
with
her
elbow
whenever
that
little
person
moved
but
finally
she
found
courage
to
turn
her
head
so
she
could
see
sadie
sadie
was
weeping
into
her
handkerchief
nor
were
they
the
tears
of
histrionic
talent
they
were
real
tears
people
all
about
were
looking
at
her
sympathetically
such
grief
in
a
grandchild
was
very
moving
it
may
have
been
minutes
it
seemed
to
emmy
lou
hours
before
there
came
a
general
hattie
stood
up
so
did
sadie
and
emmy
lou
their
skirts
no
longer
stood
out
jauntily
they
were
quite
crushed
and
subdued
there
was
a
wild
hunted
look
in
hattie
eyes
watch
the
chance
she
whispered
and
run
but
it
did
not
come
as
the
pews
emptied
the
stout
lady
passed
emmy
lou
on
addressing
some
one
beyond
hold
to
this
one
she
said
and
take
the
other
two
or
they
get
tramped
in
the
crowd
emmy
lou
felt
herself
grasped
she
could
not
see
up
to
find
by
whom
the
crowd
in
the
aisle
had
closed
above
her
head
but
she
heard
the
stout
lady
behind
saying
did
you
ever
see
such
an
child
and
emmy
lou
judged
that
hattie
was
struggling
against
fate
slowly
the
crowd
moved
and
being
a
part
of
it
however
unwillingly
emmy
lou
moved
too
out
of
the
church
and
down
the
steps
then
came
the
crashing
of
the
band
and
the
roll
of
carriages
and
she
found
herself
in
the
front
row
on
the
curb
the
man
with
the
brandishing
sword
was
threatening
violently
one
more
carriage
is
here
for
the
family
called
the
man
with
the
sword
his
face
was
red
and
his
voice
was
hoarse
his
glance
in
search
for
the
family
suddenly
fell
on
emmy
lou
she
felt
it
fall
the
problem
solved
itself
for
the
man
with
the
sword
and
his
brow
cleared
grandchildren
next
roared
the
threatening
man
grandchildren
echoed
the
crowd
hattie
and
sadie
were
pushed
forward
from
somewhere
hattie
lifting
her
voice
but
what
was
the
cry
of
a
hattie
before
the
brazen
utterance
of
the
band
sadie
was
weeping
wildly
emmy
lou
with
the
courage
of
despair
cried
out
in
the
grasp
of
the
threatening
man
but
the
man
lifting
her
into
the
carriage
was
speaking
himself
and
to
the
driver
keep
an
eye
on
them
separated
from
the
family
he
was
explaining
and
a
moment
later
hattie
and
sadie
were
lifted
after
emmy
lou
into
the
carriage
and
as
the
door
banged
their
carriage
moved
with
the
rest
up
the
street
now
said
hattie
and
hattie
sprang
to
the
farther
door
it
would
not
open
things
never
will
in
dreadful
dreams
through
the
carriage
windows
the
school
with
its
arched
doorways
and
windows
gazed
frowningly
reproachfully
a
gentleman
entered
the
gate
and
went
in
the
doorway
it
our
minister
said
sadie
weeping
afresh
hattie
beat
upon
the
window
and
called
to
the
driver
but
no
mortal
ear
could
have
heard
above
that
band
an
my
brother
an
an
the
rest
said
hattie
and
hattie
wept
and
the
visiting
lady
next
door
said
emmy
lou
she
did
not
mean
to
weep
tears
did
not
come
readily
to
emmy
lou
but
just
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
handkerchief
still
held
by
its
exact
centre
in
her
hand
what
would
the
exhibition
do
without
them
then
emmy
lou
wept
late
that
afternoon
a
carriage
stopped
at
a
corner
upon
which
a
school
building
stood
since
his
charges
were
but
infantile
affairs
the
coloured
gentleman
on
the
box
thought
to
expedite
matters
and
drop
them
at
the
corner
nearest
their
homes
descending
the
coloured
gentleman
flung
open
the
door
and
three
little
girls
crept
forth
three
crushed
little
girls
three
limp
little
girls
three
little
girls
in
a
mild
kind
of
mourning
they
came
forth
timidly
they
looked
around
they
hoped
they
might
reach
their
homes
unobserved
there
was
a
crowd
up
the
street
a
gathering
of
people
many
people
it
seemed
to
be
at
emmy
lou
gate
hattie
and
sadie
lived
farther
on
it
must
be
a
fire
said
hattie
but
it
was
it
was
the
exhibition
the
principal
and
miss
carrie
and
teachers
and
pupils
and
mammas
and
aunties
and
uncle
charlie
an
said
hattie
and
the
visiting
lady
said
emmy
lou
and
our
minister
said
sadie
the
gathering
of
many
people
caught
sight
of
them
presently
and
came
to
meet
them
three
little
girls
in
mild
mourning
the
little
girls
moved
slowly
but
the
crowd
moved
rapidly
the
gentlemen
laughed
uncle
charlie
and
the
minister
and
the
papa
or
two
laughed
when
they
heard
and
laughed
again
and
went
on
laughing
they
leaned
against
the
fence
but
the
ladies
could
see
nothing
funny
the
mammas
nor
aunt
cordelia
that
mild
mourning
had
been
the
result
of
anxious
planning
and
consultation
neither
could
miss
carrie
she
said
they
had
failed
her
she
said
it
in
her
deepest
tones
and
used
gestures
sadie
wept
for
the
sight
of
miss
carrie
recalled
afresh
the
tears
she
should
have
shed
with
histrionic
talent
the
parents
and
guardians
led
them
home
emmy
lou
was
tired
she
was
used
to
a
quiet
life
and
never
before
had
been
in
the
public
eye
at
supper
she
nodded
and
mild
mourning
and
all
suddenly
emmy
lou
collapsed
and
fell
asleep
her
head
against
her
chair
uncle
charlie
woke
her
he
stood
her
up
on
the
chair
and
held
out
his
arms
uncle
charlie
meant
to
carry
her
as
if
she
were
a
baby
thing
again
up
to
bed
come
said
uncle
charlie
emmy
lou
stood
dazed
and
flushed
she
was
not
yet
quite
awake
uncle
charlie
had
caught
snatches
of
school
vernacular
come
said
he
suit
the
action
to
the
word
emmy
lou
woke
suddenly
the
words
smiting
her
ears
with
ominous
import
she
thought
the
hour
had
come
it
was
the
exhibition
she
stood
stiffly
she
advanced
a
cautious
foot
her
chubby
hand
described
a
careful
half
circle
emmy
lou
spoke
we
know
not
where
we
go
said
emmy
lou
no
more
we
do
said
uncle
charlie
the
shadow
of
a
tragedy
miss
lizzie
kept
in
the
ways
of
teachers
like
rainy
days
and
growing
pains
belong
to
the
inexplicable
and
inevitable
all
teachers
have
ways
that
is
to
be
expected
it
is
the
part
of
an
emmy
lou
to
adjust
herself
to
meet
not
to
try
to
understand
these
ways
miss
lizzie
kept
in
but
that
was
only
one
of
her
ways
she
had
many
others
perhaps
they
were
no
more
peculiar
than
the
ways
of
her
predecessors
but
they
were
more
alarming
miss
lizzie
placed
a
deliberate
hand
on
her
call
bell
and
as
its
vibrations
dinged
and
smote
upon
the
shrinking
tympanum
a
rigid
and
breathless
expectancy
would
pervade
the
silence
of
the
fourth
reader
room
miss
lizzie
was
tall
she
seemed
to
tower
up
and
over
one
personality
one
had
no
mind
of
her
own
but
one
said
what
one
thought
miss
lizzie
wanted
her
to
say
sometimes
one
got
it
wrong
then
miss
lizzie
cold
survey
smote
one
into
a
condition
something
akin
to
vacuity
until
miss
lizzie
said
briefly
sit
down
then
one
sat
down
hastily
miss
lizzie
never
wasted
a
word
miss
lizzie
closed
her
lips
she
closed
them
so
their
lines
were
blue
her
eyes
were
blue
too
but
not
a
pleasant
blue
miss
lizzie
did
not
scold
she
looked
she
kept
looking
until
one
became
aware
of
an
elbow
resting
on
the
desk
in
her
room
little
girls
must
sit
erect
sometimes
she
changed
it
came
suddenly
one
day
it
came
suddenly
and
miss
lizzie
boxed
the
little
girl
ears
the
little
girl
had
knocked
over
a
pile
of
slates
collected
on
the
platform
for
marking
another
time
she
changed
it
was
when
the
little
girl
brought
a
note
from
home
because
her
ears
were
boxed
miss
lizzie
tore
the
note
in
pieces
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
one
lived
in
dread
of
her
changing
one
watched
in
order
to
know
the
thing
she
wanted
emmy
lou
knew
every
characteristic
feature
of
her
face
the
lean
nose
that
bent
toward
the
cheek
the
thin
lips
that
tightened
and
relaxed
the
cold
survey
that
travelled
from
desk
to
desk
miss
lizzie
thin
hands
were
never
still
any
more
than
were
her
eyes
most
often
her
fingers
tore
bits
of
paper
into
fine
shreds
while
she
heard
lessons
life
is
strenuous
in
each
reader
the
strenuousness
had
taken
a
different
form
in
the
fourth
reader
it
was
miss
lizzie
always
took
an
honour
in
and
she
meant
to
take
an
honour
this
year
but
the
road
to
fame
is
laborious
she
had
her
methods
each
morning
she
gave
out
four
slips
of
paper
to
each
little
girl
this
was
trial
paper
on
these
slips
each
little
girl
practised
until
the
result
was
good
enough
in
miss
lizzie
opinion
to
go
into
the
book
some
lines
must
be
fine
and
over
these
emmy
lou
held
her
breath
anxiously
others
must
be
heavy
and
laboured
over
these
she
unconsciously
put
the
tip
of
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
until
it
was
just
visible
between
her
lips
what
however
is
school
for
but
the
accommodating
of
self
to
the
changing
demands
of
teachers
in
the
fourth
reader
it
was
fine
lines
on
the
upward
strokes
and
heavy
lines
on
the
downward
emmy
lou
finally
found
the
way
by
turning
the
pen
over
and
writing
with
the
back
of
the
point
the
upward
strokes
emerged
fine
and
this
having
somewhat
altered
the
mechanism
of
the
pen
point
its
reversal
brought
lines
sombre
and
heavy
it
was
slow
and
laborious
and
it
spoiled
an
alarming
number
of
pen
points
but
then
it
achieved
fine
lines
upward
and
heavy
lines
downward
and
that
is
what
are
for
hattie
reached
the
result
differently
she
kept
two
bottles
of
ink
one
for
fine
and
one
for
heavy
lines
one
was
watered
ink
and
one
was
not
the
trouble
was
about
the
one
could
have
only
four
pieces
and
the
copy
could
go
in
the
book
only
after
the
writing
on
the
trial
paper
met
with
the
approval
of
miss
lizzie
so
if
one
reached
the
end
of
the
before
reaching
approval
one
was
kept
in
for
a
half
page
of
must
be
done
each
day
and
kept
in
meant
staying
after
school
in
hunger
disgrace
and
the
silence
of
a
great
deserted
building
to
write
on
until
the
copy
was
good
enough
to
be
put
in
emmy
lou
did
not
sit
with
hattie
in
the
fourth
reader
on
the
first
day
miss
lizzie
asked
the
class
if
there
was
any
a
little
girl
preferred
at
that
one
heart
opened
and
one
told
miss
lizzie
at
first
emmy
lou
did
not
understand
for
miss
lizzie
promptly
seated
all
the
mates
as
far
apart
as
possible
emmy
lou
thought
about
it
seemed
as
though
miss
lizzie
did
it
to
be
then
emmy
lou
cheeks
grew
hot
she
put
the
thought
quickly
away
that
she
might
forget
it
but
the
wedge
was
entered
teachers
were
no
longer
emmy
lou
had
questioned
the
motives
of
pedagogic
deism
and
so
emmy
lou
and
hattie
were
separated
but
there
were
three
new
little
girls
near
emmy
lou
their
kid
had
tassels
very
few
little
girls
had
were
new
emmy
lou
had
she
was
proud
of
them
but
they
did
not
have
tassels
the
three
new
little
girls
looked
amused
at
everything
and
exchanged
glances
but
they
were
not
mean
glances
not
the
kind
of
glances
when
little
girls
nudge
each
other
and
go
off
to
whisper
emmy
lou
liked
the
new
little
girls
she
could
not
keep
from
looking
at
them
they
spread
their
skirts
so
easily
when
they
sat
down
there
was
something
alluring
about
the
little
girls
at
recess
emmy
lou
waited
near
the
door
for
them
they
all
went
out
together
after
that
they
were
friends
they
lived
on
emmy
lou
square
it
was
strange
but
they
had
just
come
there
to
live
that
explained
it
in
the
white
house
the
white
house
with
the
big
yard
the
tallest
of
the
little
girls
explained
she
was
alice
the
others
were
her
cousins
they
were
rosalie
and
amanthus
such
charming
names
emmy
lou
was
glad
that
she
lived
in
the
other
white
house
on
the
square
with
the
next
biggest
yard
she
never
had
thought
of
it
before
but
now
she
was
glad
alice
talked
and
amanthus
shook
her
curls
back
off
her
shoulders
and
rosalie
wore
a
little
blue
locket
hung
on
a
golden
chain
and
rosalie
laughed
is
it
funny
and
dear
asked
alice
what
said
emmy
lou
the
public
school
said
alice
is
it
said
emmy
lou
and
then
they
all
laughed
and
they
hugged
emmy
lou
these
three
fluttering
butterflies
and
they
told
emmy
lou
she
was
funny
and
dear
also
we
never
been
before
said
alice
but
we
are
too
far
from
the
other
school
now
said
rosalie
it
was
private
school
said
amanthus
and
this
is
public
school
said
alice
it
very
different
said
amanthus
oh
very
said
rosalie
emmy
lou
went
and
brought
hattie
to
know
the
little
girls
all
the
year
emmy
lou
was
bringing
hattie
to
know
the
little
girls
but
hattie
did
not
seem
to
like
the
little
girls
as
emmy
lou
did
she
seemed
to
prefer
sadie
when
she
could
not
have
emmy
lou
alone
hattie
liked
to
lead
she
could
lead
sadie
generally
she
could
lead
emmy
lou
not
always
but
all
the
while
slowly
a
conviction
was
taking
hold
in
emmy
mind
it
was
a
conviction
concerning
miss
lizzie
near
emmy
lou
in
the
fourth
reader
room
sat
a
little
girl
named
lisa
lisa
schmit
once
emmy
lou
had
seen
lisa
in
a
doorway
a
store
doorway
hung
with
festoons
of
linked
sausage
lisa
had
told
emmy
lou
it
was
her
papa
grocery
store
one
day
the
air
of
the
fourth
reader
room
seemed
unpleasantly
freighted
as
the
stove
grew
hotter
the
unpleasantness
grew
assertive
forty
little
girls
were
bending
over
their
slates
it
was
problems
it
had
been
digits
integral
numbers
tables
rudiments
according
to
the
teacher
in
one
upward
course
from
the
primer
but
now
it
was
problems
though
in
its
nature
it
was
always
the
same
as
complicated
as
in
its
name
it
was
varied
the
air
was
most
unpleasant
it
took
the
mind
off
the
finding
of
the
greatest
common
divisor
the
on
miss
lizzie
desk
dinged
the
suddenness
and
the
emphasis
of
the
ding
told
on
unexpected
nerves
but
it
brought
the
fourth
reader
class
up
erect
illustration
file
by
the
platform
in
order
bringing
your
lunch
miss
lizzie
was
about
to
speak
emmy
lou
watched
miss
lizzie
lips
open
emmy
lou
often
found
herself
watching
miss
lizzie
lips
open
it
took
an
actual
deliberate
space
of
time
they
opened
moistened
themselves
then
shaped
the
word
who
in
this
room
has
lunch
said
miss
lizzie
and
her
very
tones
hurt
it
was
as
though
one
were
doing
wrong
in
having
lunch
many
hands
were
raised
there
were
luncheons
in
nearly
every
desk
file
by
the
platform
in
order
bringing
your
lunch
said
miss
lizzie
illustration
lisa
head
went
down
on
her
arm
on
the
desk
feeling
apprehensively
criminal
of
what
however
she
had
no
idea
emmy
lou
went
into
line
lunch
in
hand
one
luncheon
might
be
all
that
it
should
neatly
pinned
in
a
fringed
napkin
by
aunt
cordelia
but
one
felt
embarrassed
carrying
it
up
some
were
in
newspaper
emmy
lou
heart
ached
for
those
meanwhile
miss
lizzie
bent
and
deliberately
smelled
of
each
package
in
turn
as
the
little
girls
filed
by
most
of
the
faces
of
the
little
girls
were
red
then
came
lisa
lisa
schmit
her
lunch
was
in
paper
heavy
brown
paper
miss
lizzie
smelled
of
lisa
lunch
and
stopped
the
line
open
it
said
miss
lizzie
lisa
rested
it
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
untied
it
the
unpleasantness
wafted
heavily
there
was
sausage
and
dark
gray
bread
and
cheese
it
was
the
cheese
that
was
unpleasant
miss
lizzie
nose
which
bent
slightly
toward
her
cheek
had
a
way
of
dilating
it
dilated
now
go
open
the
stove
door
said
miss
lizzie
lisa
went
and
opened
the
stove
door
now
take
it
and
put
it
in
said
miss
lizzie
lisa
took
her
lunch
and
put
it
in
her
round
little
cheeks
had
turned
a
mottled
red
when
she
got
back
to
her
seat
lisa
head
went
down
on
her
arm
on
the
desk
and
presently
even
her
yellow
plaits
shook
with
the
convulsiveness
of
her
sobs
it
was
the
loss
of
the
sausage
or
the
bread
or
the
cheese
emmy
lou
was
a
big
girl
now
and
she
knew
emmy
lou
went
home
it
was
at
the
dinner
table
i
do
like
miss
lizzie
said
she
aunt
cordelia
was
incredulous
scandalised
you
must
talk
so
little
girls
must
not
know
what
they
like
said
aunt
louise
aunt
louise
was
apt
to
be
sententious
she
was
young
except
in
puddings
said
uncle
charlie
passing
emmy
lou
saucer
there
was
pudding
for
dinner
but
wrong
or
not
emmy
lou
knew
that
it
was
so
she
knew
she
did
not
like
miss
lizzie
one
morning
miss
lizzie
forgot
the
package
of
the
supply
was
out
she
called
rosalie
then
she
called
emmy
lou
she
told
them
where
her
house
was
then
told
them
to
go
there
ring
the
bell
ask
for
the
paper
and
return
it
seemed
strange
and
unreal
to
be
walking
the
streets
in
rosalie
skipped
so
emmy
lou
skipped
too
miss
lizzie
lived
seven
squares
away
it
was
a
cottage
a
little
cottage
on
one
side
its
high
board
fence
ran
along
an
alley
but
on
the
other
side
was
a
big
yard
with
trees
and
bushes
the
cottage
was
almost
hidden
and
it
seemed
strange
and
far
off
rosalie
rang
the
bell
then
emmy
lou
rang
the
bell
nobody
came
they
kept
on
ringing
the
bell
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
they
were
afraid
to
go
back
and
tell
miss
lizzie
so
they
went
around
the
side
it
was
a
narrow
paved
court
between
the
house
and
the
high
board
fence
it
was
dark
they
held
each
other
hands
there
was
a
window
someone
tapped
it
was
a
lady
a
pretty
lady
there
was
a
flower
in
her
hair
an
artificial
flower
she
nodded
to
them
she
smiled
she
laughed
then
she
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
emmy
lou
and
rosalie
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
lady
pointed
to
her
throat
and
then
to
rosalie
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
blue
locket
on
the
golden
chain
she
wanted
then
someone
came
it
was
an
old
woman
it
was
the
servant
miss
lizzie
had
said
would
come
to
the
door
she
came
from
the
front
she
had
been
away
somewhere
she
looked
cross
she
told
them
to
go
around
to
the
front
door
as
they
went
the
lady
tapped
rosalie
looked
back
rosalie
said
the
lady
had
pulled
the
flower
from
her
hair
and
was
tearing
it
to
pieces
the
old
woman
brought
the
she
told
them
not
to
mention
coming
around
in
the
court
and
not
to
say
they
had
had
to
wait
it
was
strange
but
many
things
are
strange
when
one
is
ten
one
learns
to
put
many
strange
things
aside
there
were
more
worrisome
things
nearer
the
screw
was
loose
which
secured
the
iron
foot
of
emmy
lou
desk
to
the
floor
now
the
front
of
one
desk
formed
the
seat
to
the
next
muscles
even
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
miss
lizzie
rigid
discipline
sometimes
rebel
the
little
girl
sitting
in
front
of
emmy
lou
was
given
to
spasmodic
changes
of
posture
causing
unexpected
upheavals
of
emmy
lou
desk
on
one
of
these
occasions
emmy
lou
ink
bottle
went
over
it
was
hour
that
one
apron
beautiful
with
much
fine
ruffling
should
be
ruined
was
a
small
matter
when
one
had
been
straight
in
the
path
of
the
flood
neither
was
emmy
lou
condition
of
digital
helplessness
to
be
thought
of
although
it
did
seem
as
if
all
great
neptune
ocean
and
more
might
be
needed
to
make
those
little
fingers
white
again
sponges
and
neighbourly
solicitude
did
what
they
could
but
the
was
steeped
indelibly
past
redemption
illustration
she
raised
a
timid
and
hand
still
not
a
word
from
miss
lizzie
only
a
cold
and
prolonged
survey
of
the
scene
only
an
entire
suspension
of
action
in
the
fourth
reader
room
while
miss
lizzie
waited
at
last
emmy
lou
was
ready
to
resume
work
she
raised
a
timid
and
hand
and
made
known
her
need
please
i
have
no
miss
lizzie
lips
unclosed
had
she
waited
for
this
then
said
miss
lizzie
you
will
stay
after
school
emmy
lou
heart
burned
the
colour
slowly
left
her
cheeks
it
was
something
besides
emmy
lou
that
looked
straight
out
of
emmy
eyes
at
miss
lizzie
it
was
judgment
lizzie
was
not
emmy
lou
did
not
reach
home
until
dinner
was
long
over
she
had
first
to
cover
four
slips
of
and
half
a
page
in
her
book
with
upward
strokes
fine
and
and
downward
strokes
black
and
heavy
emmy
lou
ate
her
dinner
alone
at
supper
she
spoke
emmy
lou
generally
spoke
conclusions
and
unless
pressed
did
not
enter
into
the
processes
of
her
reasoning
i
do
want
to
go
to
school
any
more
aunt
cordelia
looked
shocked
aunt
louise
looked
stern
uncle
charlie
looked
at
emmy
lou
that
sounds
more
natural
said
uncle
charlie
but
nobody
listened
she
been
missing

growing
too
fast

aunt
cordelia
who
had
just
been
ripping
two
tucks
out
of
emmy
lou
last
winter
dress
she
ca
be
well
so
emmy
lou
was
taken
to
the
doctor
who
gave
her
a
tonic
and
following
this
she
all
at
once
regained
her
usual
cheerful
little
state
of
mind
and
expressed
no
more
unwillingness
to
go
to
school
but
it
was
not
the
tonic

one
loved
the
far
corner
of
the
sofa
it
was

rosalie
brought
it
it
belonged
to
her
and
to
alice
and
to
amanthus
they
lent
it
to
emmy

the
glamour
opened
and
closed
about
emmy

she

knew
it
all
why
the

gleamed

world
of
the
green
and
gold
book
for
the
green
and
gold
book
was
the
book
of
fairy
tales
the
strange
the
inexplicable
the
meaningless
that
hitherto
one
had
thought
the
real
teachers
problems
such
they
became
the
outer
world
the
things
of
small
matter
one
loved
the
far
corner
of
the
sofa
now
with
the
book
in
one
lap
with
one
hair
falling
about
one
face
and
book
shutting
out
the
unreal
world
and
its
people
the
real
world
lay
between
the
covers
of
the
green
and
gold
book
the
real
world
and
its
people
and
the
princess
was
always
rosalie
and
the
prince
ah
the
prince
was
the
prince
one
had
met
one
rosalie
but
not
yet
the
prince
one
could
not
talk
of
these
things
except
to
rosalie
hattie
would
not
understand
one
was
glad
when
rosalie
told
them
to
alice
and
amanthus
but
one
could
not
tell
one
self
and
miss
lizzie
miss
lizzie
had
stepped
all
at
once
into
her
proper
place
one
had
not
understood
before
one
would
not
want
miss
lizzie
different
it
was
right
and
natural
to
miss
lizzie
condition
which
condition
varied
according
to
the
page
in
the
book
for
miss
lizzie
was
the
cruel
miss
lizzie
was
the
wicked
fairy
godmother
miss
lizzie
was
the
ogress
the
wife
of
the
terrible
giant
one
told
rosalie
but
rosalie
went
even
further
miss
lizzie
was
the
grim
and
terrible
ogress
who
dwelt
in
her
lonely
castle
true
the
was
the
castle
of
the
ogress
and
the
forty
little
girls
in
the
fourth
reader
were
the
captives
the
captive
princesses
kept
by
miss
lizzie
until
certain
tasks
were
performed
one
looked
at
problems
differently
now
one
saw
through
a
glamour
they
were
tasks
and
each
task
done
the
nearer
release
from
miss
lizzie
did
one
fail
emmy
lou
held
her
breath
rosalie
spoke
softly
the
lady
at
the
window
her
finger
at
her
lips
she
had
failed
miss
lizzie
was
the
ogress
and
the
lady
was
the
princess
the
captive
princess
waiting
at
the
window
for
release
and
so
one
played
one
part
and
so
emmy
lou
and
rosalie
moved
and
lived
and
dreamed
in
the
glamour
and
the
world
of
the
green
and
gold
book
it
stayed
in
one
desk
sometimes
with
alice
or
with
amanthus
sometimes
with
rosalie
it
was
with
emmy
lou
one
never
read
in
school
but
at
recess
on
the
steps
outside
the
big
door
one
read
aloud
in
turn
while
the
others
ate
their
apples
and
hattie
came
too
when
she
liked
and
sadie
but
one
carried
the
book
home
that
one
might
not
be
parted
from
it
it
was
with
emmy
lou
it
had
certain
treasures
between
its
leaves
one
expects
to
find
faint
sweet
between
the
pages
of
the
green
and
gold
book
and
the
scrap
of
tinsel
recalls
the
gleam
and
shimmer
of
the
goose
girl
of
woven
moonbeams
the
book
was
in
emmy
lou
desk
emmy
lou
was
at
the
board
it
was
problems
she
did
not
need
a
book
miss
lizzie
dictated
when
one
was
at
the
board
emmy
lou
was
poor
at
problems
and
miss
lizzie
was
cross
about
it
sadie
at
her
desk
needed
a
book
she
had
forgotten
her
arithmetic
and
asked
permission
to
borrow
emmy
lou
illustration
you
had
any
right
she
went
to
get
it
she
pulled
it
out
sadie
had
a
way
of
being
unfortunate
she
also
pulled
another
book
out
which
fell
open
on
the
floor
shedding
and
tinsel
the
green
and
gold
glitter
of
the
book
caught
miss
lizzie
eye
her
fingers
had
been
tearing
at
bits
of
paper
all
morning
until
her
desk
was
strewn
bring
it
to
me
she
said
miss
lizzie
took
the
book
from
sadie
and
looked
at
it
emmy
lou
had
just
failed
quite
miserably
at
problems
miss
lizzie
face
changed
it
was
as
if
a
white
rage
passed
over
it
she
stepped
to
the
stove
and
cast
the
book
in
the
very
flames
turned
green
and
gold
it
was
gone
the
world
of
glamour
of
glory
of
dreams
the
world
of
emmy
lou
and
rosalie
of
alice
and
amanthus
it
was
not
emmy
lou
it
was
a
cry
through
emmy
lou
emmy
lou
was
just
beginning
to
grow
tall
just
losing
the
faith
of
babyhood
had
any
it
was
terrible
the
fourth
reader
class
failed
to
breathe
emmy
lou
must
say
she
was
sorry
emmy
lou
would
not
the
hours
of
school
dragged
on
emmy
lou
sat
silent
rosalie
looked
at
her
laughter
had
died
in
rosalie
cheek
rosalie
pressed
her
fingers
tight
in
misery
for
emmy
lou
sadie
looked
at
emmy
lou
sadie
wept
hattie
looked
at
emmy
lou
hattie
straightened
her
straight
little
back
and
ground
her
little
teeth
hattie
was
of
that
blood
which
has
risen
up
and
slain
for
affection
sake
this
was
an
emmy
lou
nobody
knew
brooding
defiant
there
are
strange
potentialities
in
every
emmy
lou
the
last
bell
rang
emmy
lou
must
say
she
was
sorry
emmy
lou
would
not
everyone
went
everyone
but
emmy
lou
and
miss
lizzie
casting
backward
looks
of
awe
and
commiseration
to
be
left
alone
in
that
nearness
solitude
entails
meant
torture
the
torture
of
loathing
of
shrinking
of
revulsion
she
must
say
she
was
sorry
emmy
lou
was
not
sorry
she
sat
the
tears
would
come
later
more
than
once
this
year
they
had
come
after
home
and
aunt
cordelia
arms
were
reached
and
aunt
cordelia
had
thought
it
was
because
one
was
growing
too
fast
and
aunt
cordelia
had
rocked
and
patted
and
sung
about
the
frog
who
would
go
and
then
emmy
lou
had
laughed
because
aunt
cordelia
did
not
know
that
the
frog
and
jenny
wren
and
the
little
wee
bear
were
gone
into
the
past
and
the
green
and
gold
book
come
to
take
their
place
the
bell
had
rung
at
two
at
three
tom
came
tom
was
the
he
was
suave
and
and
smiling
he
had
come
for
emmy
lou
miss
lizzie
looked
at
emmy
lou
emmy
lou
looked
straight
ahead
then
miss
lizzie
looked
at
tom
miss
lizzie
could
do
a
good
deal
with
a
look
tom
became
uneasy
apologetic
guilty
then
he
went
it
took
a
good
deal
to
wilt
tom
at
three
he
knocked
at
the
door
again
he
gave
his
message
from
outside
the
threshold
this
time
emmy
lou
must
come
home
miss
cordelia
said
so
emmy
lou
papa
had
come
emmy
lou
heard
papa
who
came
a
hundred
miles
once
a
month
to
see
her
would
emmy

say
she
was
sorry
emmy
lou
was
not
sorry
she
could
not

the
door

on
returning
from

through

was
an
editor
and
had
a
mental
habit
of
classifying
people
while
they
talked
and
putting
them
away
in
while
aunt
cordelia
talked
he
was
putting
her
in
a
marked
guileless
she
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
door
brother
richard
said
aunt
cordelia
quite
flushed
and
breathless
with
the
door
drawn
to
behind
her
she
a
terrifying
woman
richard
she
said
it
was
a
case
for
discipline
she
said
she
would
allow
no
interference
my
precious
baby
and
i
kept
on
giving
her
iron
uncle
charlie
had
come
out
with
the
buggy
to
take
his
driving
what
did
you
come
back
without
her
for
demanded
uncle
charlie
aunt
cordelia
turned
on
uncle
charlie
you
go
and
see
why
said
aunt
cordelia
truly
an
aunt
cordelia
is
the
last
one
to
stand
before
a
miss
lizzie
uncle
charlie
took
his
in
the
buggy
and
they
drove
to
the
school
emmy
lou
father
went
in
uncle
charlie
sat
in
the
buggy
and
waited
uncle
charlie
wondered
if
it
was
right
miss
lizzie
was
one
of
three
one
was
in
an
asylum
one
was
kept
at
home
and
miss
lizzie
with
her
rages
taught
but
could
one
speak
and
take
work
and
bread
from
a
miss
lizzie
when
papa
came
down
he
had
emmy
lou
by
the
hand
he
had
also
a
sternness
about
his
mouth
i
got
her
you
see
he
explained
with
an
assumption
of
comical
chagrin
but
with
limitations
she
got
to
say
she
sorry
or
she
ca
come
back
i
not
sorry
said
emmy
lou
wearily
but
with
steadiness
stick
it
out
said
uncle
charlie
who
knew
his
emmy
lou
she
need
go
back
this
year
said
aunt
cordelia
when
she
heard
my
precious
baby
i
will
teach
her
at
home
said
aunt
louise
there
must
be
other
green
and
gold
books
said
papa
growing
on
that
same
tree
but
uncle
charlie
with
brows
drawn
into
a
frown
was
wondering
all
the
winds
of
doctrine
emmy
lou
was
now
a
big
girl
one
climbed
from
floor
to
floor
as
one
went
up
in
readers
with
the
fifth
reader
one
reached
the
dizzy
eminence
of
top
emmy
lou
now
stood
as
it
were
upon
a
peak
in
darien
and
stared
at
the
great
unknown
rolling
ahead
called
the
grammar
school
behind
descended
the
grades
of
one
achievements
back
to
the
a
b
c
of
things
one
had
once
been
a
pygmy
part
of
the
primer
world
on
the
first
floor
one
self
and
from
there
had
gazed
upward
at
the
haloed
beings
peopling
these
same
fifth
reader
heights
but
emmy
lou
felt
that
somehow
she
was
failing
to
experience
the
expected
sense
of
dizzy
height
or
the
joy
of
perquisite
and
privilege
to
be
sure
being
a
big
girl
she
found
herself
at
recess
one
of
many
taking
hands
in
long
undulating
line
and
like
the
assyrian
sweeping
down
on
the
fold
while
the
fold
in
the
shape
of
little
girls
fled
shrieking
before
the
onslaught
but
there
had
been
a
time
when
emmy
lou
had
been
a
little
girl
and
had
fled
shrieking
herself
the
memory
kept
her
from
quite
enjoying
the
onslaught
now
though
of
course
a
little
girl
of
the
under
world
is
only
a
primary
and
must
be
made
to
feel
it
the
privileged
members
of
the
fifth
reader
world
are
intermediates
they
are
other
things
too
they
are
episcopalians
or
presbyterians
or
some
other
correspondingly
polysyllabic
thing
as
the
case
may
be
in
this
case
each
seemed
to
be
a
different
thing
hattie
first
called
the
attention
of
emmy
lou
to
it
the
fifth
reader
members
ate
lunch
in
groups
without
knowing
it
one
was
growing
gregarious
and
as
becomes
a
higher
social
state
one
passed
one
luncheon
around
illustration
hattie
took
emmy
lou
aside
their
religion
emmy
lou
passed
her
luncheon
around
emmy
lou
herself
knew
the
joys
of
eating
and
hers
too
was
a
hospitable
soul
she
brought
liberal
luncheons
on
this
day
between
the
disks
of
her
beaten
biscuit
showed
the
pinkness
of
sliced
ham
mary
agatha
drew
back
mary
agatha
was
emmy

newest
friend
friday
said
mary
agatha
of
course
said
rosalie
i
forgot
rosalie
put
her
biscuit
back
it
ham
said
rebecca
steinau
emmy
lou
was
hurt
it
seemed
almost
like
preconcerted
reflection
on
her
biscuits
and
her
ham
hattie
took
emmy
lou
aside
it
their
religion
said
hattie
in
tones
of
large
tolerance
we
can
eat
anything
you
and
i
and
presbyterians
but
rosalie
said
emmy
lou
rosalie
like
emmy
lou
was
episcopalian
but
rosalie
had
joined
hattie
and
emmy
lou
my
little
brother
singing
in
the
vested
choir
said
rosalie
and
we
going
to
be
high
church
hattie
looked
at
rosalie
steadily
then
hattie
took
another
biscuit
hattie
took
another
biscuit
deliberately
aggressively
it
was
as
though
with
hattie
to
take
another
biscuit
was
a
matter
of
conscience
and
protest
hattie
was
presbyterian
but
to
emmy
lou
biscuits
and
ham
had
lost
their
savour
emmy
lou
admired
rebecca
rebecca
could
reduce
pounds
and
shillings
to
pence
with
a
rapidity
that
emmy
lou
could
not
even
follow
yet
rebecca
stooped
from
this
eminence
to
help
labouring
emmy
lou
with
her
sums
and
emmy
lou
saw
life
through
rosalie
eyes
emmy
lou
trudged
unquestioningly
after
where
the
winged
feet
of
rosalie
fancy
led
for
yet
about
rosalie
light
footsteps
trailed
back
some
clouds
of
glory
and
through
the
eyes
of
rosalie
one
still
caught
visions
of
the
glory
and
the
dream
and
high
as
are
the
peaks
of
the
fifth
reader
heights
mary
agatha
stood
on
one
yet
higher
mary
agatha
went
to
church
not
only
on
sundays
but
on
saints
days
mary
agatha
loved
to
go
to
church
but
for
the
matter
of
that
rebecca
went
to
church
on
saturdays
when
did
rebecca
to
emmy
lou
church
meant
several
things
it
meant
going
when
down
in
her
depraved
heart
lay
the
knowledge
she
tried
to
hide
even
from
herself
that
she
did
not
want
to
go
it
meant
a
sore
and
troubled
conscience
because
her
eye
would
travel
ahead
on
the
page
to
the
amens
the
amens
signified
the
end
and
it
meant
a
fierce
and
unholy
joy
that
would
not
down
when
that
end
came
but
mary
agatha
loved
to
go
to
church
and
rebecca
gave
saturdays
to
church
and
now
rosalie
who
admired
mary
agatha
was
taking
to
church
no
wonder
that
to
emmy
lou
biscuits
and
ham
were
tasteless
but
the
fifth
reader
is
an
age
of
revelation
one
is
more
than
an
intermediate
one
is
an
animal
and
a
biped
one
had
to
confess
it
on
paper
in
a
composition
under
the
head
of
man
one
accepted
the
intermediate
and
biped
easily
because
of
a
haziness
of
comprehension
but
to
hear
that
one
is
an
animal
was
a
shock
but
miss
fanny
said
so
miss
fanny
also
said
the
course
in
language
was
absurd
she
said
it
under
her
breath
she
said
it
as
emmy
lou
handed
in
her
composition
on
man
so
one
was
an
animal
one
felt
confidence
in
miss
fanny
statements
miss
fanny
walked
lightly
she
laughed
in
her
eyes
that
last
fact
one
did
not
cherish
against
miss
fanny
though
sometimes
one
smiled
doubtfully
back
at
her
was
miss
fanny
laughing
at
one
miss
fanny
was
a
real
person
the
others
had
been
teachers
miss
fanny
had
a
grandpapa
he
was
rich
and
she
had
a
mamma
who
cried
about
miss
fanny
teaching
school
but
her
grandpapa
said
he
was
proud
of
miss
fanny
emmy
lou
knew
all
about
miss
fanny
miss

was
aunt
louise
best
friend
bryan
the
principal
came
often
to
the
fifth
reader
room
he
came
for
language
lessons
bryan
told
them
he
had
himself
introduced
the
course
in
language
into
the
school
curriculum
its
purpose
he
explained
was
to
increase
the
comprehension
and
vocabulary
of
the
child
the
paucity
of
vocabulary
of
even
the
average
adult
he
said
is
lamentable
in
all
moments
of
verbal
doubt
and
perplexity
said
bryan
seek
the
dictionary
in
its
pages
you
will
find
both
vocabulary
and
elucidation
toward
spring
religions
became
more
absorbing
than
ever
one
day
rebecca
and
gertie
and
rachel
brought
notes
rebecca
and
gertie
and
rachel
must
thereafter
be
excused
on
certain
days
at
an
early
hour
for
attendance
at
confirmation
class
miss
fanny
said
of
course
but
she
reminded
them
of
examination
for
the
grammar
school
looming
ahead
a
little
later
a
second
influx
of
notes
piled
miss

mary
agatha

kitty

nora

anne

go

days
because
the
lutheran
church
was
far
in
germanberg
they

were
making
ready
for
confirmation
again
miss

reminded
them
all
of

just
at
this
time
emmy

must
go
she
said
emmy
lou
being
now
a
big
girl
ought
to
want
to
go
rosalie
being
high
had
church
every
afternoon
but
rosalie
liked
it
emmy
lou
feared
she
was
the
only
one
in
all
the
class
who
did
not
like
it
even
sadie
must
enjoy
church
for
one
day
she
missed
in
every
lesson
and
lost
her
temper
and
cried
next
day
she
brought
a
note
from
her
mamma
and
then
she
told
emmy
lou
about
it
it
asked
that
sadie
be
excused
for
missing
for
because
of
the
revival
at
her
church
sadie
would
be
up
late
every
night
bryan
was
in
the
room
when
miss
fanny
read
this
note
she
handed
it
to
him
to
each
year
its
evils
i
suppose
said
miss
fanny
to
the
primer
its
and
measles
to
the
first
reader
the
shedding
of
its
incisors
with
the
fifth
reader
comes
the
inoculation
of
doctrines
we
are
living
the
ten
great
religions
bryan
laid
the
note
down
he
said
he
must
caution
miss
fanny
that
as
principal
or
as
teacher
neither
he
nor
she
had
anything
to
do
with
the
religions
of
the
children
intrusted
to
their
care
and
he
must
remind
miss
fanny
that
these
problems
of
school
life
could
not
be
met
with
levity
he
hoped
miss
fanny
would
take
this
as
he
meant
it
kindly
the
class
listened
breathlessly
was
miss
fanny
treating
their
religions
with
levity
what
is
levity
it
was
emmy
lou
who
asked
the
others
when
they
sought
to
pin
the
accusation
to
miss
fanny
mary
agatha
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
then
she
reported
lightness
of
conduct
want
of
weight
inconstancy
vanity
frivolity
she
told
it
off
with
low
and
accusing
enunciation
it
sounded
grave
emmy
lou
was
troubled
could
miss
fanny
be
all
this
could
she
be
guilty
of
levity
it
was
soon
after
that
mary
agatha
brought
a
note
she
told
rosalie
and
emmy
lou
about
it
it
asked
that
mary
agatha
be
allowed
a
seat
to
herself
this
mary
agatha
explained
was
because
preparatory
to
confirmation
she
was
trying
to
keep
her
mind
from
secular
things
and
a
seat
to
herself
would
help
her
to
do
it
illustration
mary
agatha
was
as
one
already
apart
from
things
secular
to
rosalie
and
emmy
lou
mary
agatha
was
as
one
already
apart
from
things
secular
to
them
the
look
on
her
clear
pale
little
profile
was
already
rapt
but
mary
agatha
went
on
to
tell
them
why
she
was
different
from
kitty
or
nora
or
the
others
of
her
confirmation
class
it
was
because
she
was
going
to
be
a
bride
of
heaven
rosalie
listened
awed
but
emmy
lou
did
not
quite
understand
mary
agatha
looked
pityingly
at
her
you
know
what
a
bride
is
and
you
know
what
heaven
the
bell
rang
emmy
lou
returned
to
the
mental
eminence
of
her
fifth
reader
heights
still
hazy
yet
she
hardly
needed
the
dictionary
for
she
knew
a
bride
aunt
katie
had
been
a
bride
with
a
diamond
star
and
presents
and
emmy
lou
knew
heaven
though
lately
emmy
lou
ideas
of
heaven
had
broadened
hitherto
heaven
conceived
of
the
primitive
primary
mind
had
been
a
matter
of
vague
numbers
seated
in
parallel
rows
answering
to
something
akin
to
roll
call
and
awarded
accordingly
but
lately
a
birthday
had
brought
emmy
lou
a
book
called
tanglewood
tales
and
heaven
had
since
taken
on
an
olympian
colouring
and
diversity
more
complex
and
perplexing
miss
fanny
read
mary
agatha
note
and
looking
down
at
her
said
that
she
wondered
since
every
desk
was
in
use
in
its
dual
capacity
if
mary
agatha
were
to
devote
herself
quite
closely
to
reducing
pounds
to
pence
would
it
not
be
possible
for
her
to
forget
her
nearness
to
things
secular
mary
agatha
was
poor
in
arithmetic
and
miss
fanny
was
laughing
in
her
eyes
was
miss
fanny
laughing
at
mary
agatha
mary
agatha
cried
at
recess
she
said
her
papa
furnished
pokers
and
tongs
and
shovels
and
for
the
public
schools
and
he
would
see
to
it
that
she
had
a
seat
to
herself
if
she
wanted
it
but
when
the
class
went
up
from
recess
there
was
a
seat
for
mary
agatha
miss
fanny
had
sent
the
note
down
to
bryan
and
he
had
arranged
it
it
was
a
table
from
the
office
and
a
stool
for
want
of
other
place
they
stood
beneath
the
blackboard
in
front
of
the
class
it
was
a
high
stool
being
told
mary
agatha
gathered
her
books
together
and
went
and
climbed
upon
her
stool
apart
from
things
secular
miss
fanny
turned
to
bryan
for
the
propagation
of
infant
saint
stylites
said
miss
fanny
exactly
said
bryan
he
said
it
a
little
perhaps
doubtfully
suddenly
bryan
grew
red
he
had
caught
miss
fanny
eyes
laughing
and
saw
her
mouth
twitching
was
miss
fanny
laughing
at
bryan
what
about
bryan
went
out
he
closed
the
door
it
closed
sharply
then
everything
came
at
once
hot
weather
and
roses
and
syringa
piling
miss
fanny
desk
and
reviews
for
examination
and
confirmations
mary
agatha
asked
them
to
her
confirmation
rosalie
and
emmy
lou
went
the
great
doors
at
mary
agatha
church
opened
and
closed
behind
them
it
was
high
and
dim
there
were
twinkling
lights
and
silence
and
awe
and
colour
something
quivered
it
burst
forth
it
was
music
it
was
almost
as
if
it
hurt
one
drew
a
deep
breath
and
shut
one
eyes
a
moment
because
it
hurt
then
one
opened
them
the
aisles
were
filled
with
little
girls
in
misty
white
and
floating
veils
stealing
forward
and
mary
agatha
was
among
them
rosalie
told
emmy
lou
she
meant
some
day
to
belong
to
mary
church
emmy
lou
thought
she
would
too
illustration
and
mary
agatha
was
among
them
but
afterward
emmy
lou
found
herself
wavering
was
emmy
lou
a
sordid
soul
for
next
came
confirmation
at
the
synagogue
and
that
it
seemed
meant
presents
gertie
wore
to
school
a
locket
on
a
glittering
chain
rebecca
showed
a
new
ring
emmy
lou
faith
was
wavering
about
this
time
miss
fanny
spoke
her
mind
because
of
excuses
and
absences
because
of
abstractions
and
absorptions
miss
fanny
said
marks
were
low
and
she
reminded
them
of
examination
for
the
grammar
school
near
at
hand
then
she
asked
a
little
girl
named
sally
why
she
had
failed
to
hand
in
her
composition
illustration
gertie
wore
to
school
a
locket
on
a
glittering
chain
rebecca
showed
a
new
ring
sally
said
her
church
was
having
a
season
of
prayer
and
her
mother
said
sally
was
old
enough
now
to
go
and
as
it
was
both
afternoons
and
evenings
sally
had
had
no
time
to
write
a
composition
miss
fanny
told
sally
to
remain
in
at
recess
and
write
it
bryan
had
inquired
for
her
composition
sally
remained
in
tears
the
subject
for
her
composition
was
duty
miss
fanny
put
her
hand
on
sally
shoulder
and
said
something
about
a
divided
duty
and
sally
cried
some
more
and
miss
fanny
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
helped
her
emmy
lou
saw
it
she
had
come
upstairs
in
a
moment
of
doubt
and
perplexity
to
consult
the
dictionary
the
word
was
it
was
this
way
they
had
been
in
a
group
at
recess
and
mary
agatha
was
dividing
her
mary
agatha
said
she
had
given
up
worldly
things
and
it
would
be
a
sin
for
her
to
own
a
she
offered
hattie
a
button
hattie
refused
it
she
said
if
it
was
a
sin
to
own
a
why
should
mary
agatha
offer
her
buttons
to
other
people
and
she
walked
off
hattie
had
an
uncompromising
way
of
putting
things
hattie
was
a
presbyterian
emmy
lou
felt
anxious
she
had
been
offered
a
button
first
and
had
taken
it
gratefully
for
her
was
short
but
mary
agatha
assured
her
that
she
and
hattie
and
the
others
of
the
group
could
own
where
mary
agatha
could
not
a
mere
matter
of
a
made
small
difference
they
were
heretics
rosalie
put
her
arm
about
emmy
lou
being
high
church
she
did
not
take
it
to
herself
she
took
it
for
emmy
lou
emmy
lou
hesitated
ought
she
to
be
offended
was
she
a
heretic
emmy
lou
was
cautious
for
she
had
contradicted
hattie
about
being
an
animal
and
then
had
to
confess
on
paper
that
such
she
was
but
sadie
had
no
doubts
sadie
following
the
revival
had
joined
the
church
and
she
felt
she
knew
where
she
stood
i
have
you
know
said
sadie
i
a
christian
and
sadie
began
to
cry
rebecca
steinau
lifted
her
black
eyes
she
gave
her
beringed
little
hand
a
dramatic
and
conclusive
wave
you
all
of
you
gentiles
said
rebecca
emmy
lou
left
the
group
as
animal
biped
intermediate
low
church
episcopalian
gentile
and
possible
heretic
she
went
upstairs
to
seek
the
dictionary
it
was
a
moment
of
doubt
and
perplexity
with
labouring
absorption
she
and
her
index
finger
pored
over
the
page
one
whose
errors
are
doctrinal
and
usually
of
a
malignant
character
ought
she
to
be
offended
the
bell
rang
the
class
filed
in
sadie
eyes
were
red
miss
fanny
tried
not
to
see
her
her
eyes
were
chronically
red
but
so
insistently
and
ostentatiously
did
sadie
continue
to
mop
them
that
miss
fanny
was
compelled
to
take
notice
sadie
told
her
grievances
her
voice
broke
on
heretic
and
she
wept
afresh
at
gentile
illustration
she
and
her
index
finger
pored
over
the
page
miss
fanny
was
outdone
she
said
they
had
better
all
be
little
heretics
than
little
pharisees
she
said
she
only
needed
a
few
infant
turks
and
infidels
and
her
sectarian
babel
would
be
complete
that
day
there
were
more
notes
miss
fanny
gave
them
this
time
to
sadie
and
mary
agatha
and
rebecca
and
sally
among
others
emmy
lou
heard
about
the
notes
afterward
each
said
the
same
thing
each
said
that
sadie
or
rebecca
or
mary
agatha
or
whichever
little
girl
it
might
be
had
repeatedly
fallen
below
that
she
had
not
for
weeks
given
her
mind
to
her
lessons
and
she
could
not
conscientiously
be
recommended
as
ready
for
examination
for
the
grammar
school
the
next
day
near
recess
there
came
a
knock
at
the
fifth
reader
door
sadie
mamma
came
in
sadie
grew
red
one
always
grows
red
when
it
is
one
relative
who
comes
in
sadie
mamma
was
a
pale
little
lady
who
cried
she
cried
now
she
said
that
for
sadie
to
be
kept
back
for
no
other
reason
than
her
natural
piety
was
evidence
of
a
personal
dislike
she
said
miss
fanny
had
upheld
another
little
girl
who
called
sadie
a
heretic
miss
fanny
asked
sadie
mamma
to
sit
down
on
the
bench
recess
was
near
and
then
miss
fanny
could
talk
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
a
lady
with
black
eyes
came
in
rebecca
got
red
it
was
rebecca
mamma
she
said
rebecca
had
always
done
well
at
school
she
said
rebecca
was
grand
at
figures
she
said
miss
fanny
had
thrown
her
religion
at
rebecca
and
had
called
her
a
pharisee
miss
fanny
asked
rebecca
mamma
to
sit
down
on
the
bench
it
would
soon
be
recess
sadie
mamma
and
rebecca
mamma
looked
at
each
other
coldly
the
door
opened
sally
got
red
sally
looked
frightened
it
was
mamma
the
flower
in
her
bonnet
shook
when
she
talked
she
said
sally
had
refused
to
go
to
church
for
fear
of
miss
fanny
and
because
sally
had
been
made
to
do
her
religious
duty
she
was
being
threatened
with
failure
miss
fanny
interrupted
sally
mamma
to
say
there
was
the
bench
if
she
cared
to
sit
down
at
recess
miss
fanny
would
be
at
leisure
bryan
threw
open
the
door
mary
agatha
grew
pink
as
bryan
waved
in
a
slender
lady
with
trailing
silken
skirts
and
reproachful
eyes
it
was
mary
agatha
mamma
she
said
that
even
with
the
note
threatening
mary
agatha
with
failure
she
could
not
have
believed
it
true
that
miss
fanny
disliked
mary
agatha
because
of
the
seat
to
herself
that
miss
fanny
had
classed
mary
agatha
with
turks
and
infidels
but
since
bryan
had
just
admitted
downstairs
that
he
had
had
to
caution
miss
fanny
about
this
matter
of
religion
miss
fanny
looked
at
bryan
then
she
rang
the
bell
it
was
not
yet
but
since
miss
fanny
rang
the
bell
the
fifth
reader
class
filed
out
wonderingly
miss
fanny
looking
at
bryan
had
a
queer
smile
in
her
eyes
yet
it
was
not
as
though
miss
fanny
smile
was
laughter
but
after
all
sadie
and
mary
agatha
and
sally
and
rebecca
did
try
at
examination
miss
fanny
it
seemed
insisted
they
should
a
teacher
from
the
grammar
school
came
and
examined
the
class
later
one
went
back
to
find
out
there
was
red
ink
written
across
the
reports
of
sadie
and
sally
and
mary
agatha
and
rebecca
it
said
failure
emmy
lou
breathed
there
was
no
red
ink
on
her
report
emmy
lou
had
passed
for
the
grammar
school
mary
agatha
said
her
papa
would
see
to
it
because
she
had
failed
her
papa
furnished
pokers
and
shovels
for
the
schools
and
her
papa
would
call
on
the
board
mary
agatha
papa
did
see
to
it
and
the
papas
of
sadie
and
sally
and
rebecca
supported
him
they
called
it
religious
persecution
and
they
wanted
miss
fanny
removed
emmy
lou
heard
about
it
at
home
it
was
vacation
uncle
charlie
owned
a
newspaper
it
was
for
miss
fanny
and
miss
grandpapa
talking
at
the
gate
with
uncle
charlie
struck
the
pavement
hard
with
his
cane
he
see
about
it
too
said
her
grandpapa
emmy
lou
heard
him
but
when
it
came
time
for
the
board
to
meet
miss
fanny
it
seemed
had
resigned
aunt
louise
read
it
out
of
the
paper
at
breakfast
how
strange
said
aunt
louise
not
at
all
said
uncle
charlie
aunt
louise
said
oh
she
was
reading
on
down
the
resignation
by
request
because
the
board
in
recognition
of
her
merit
and
record
as
teacher
has
appointed
her
principal
of
the
new
school
on
elm
street
but
she
not
a
man
said
emmy
lou
when
it
had
been
explained
to
her
emmy
lou
was
bewildered
it
a
departure
said
uncle
charlie
do
tease
her
charlie
said
aunt
cordelia
emmy
lou
felt
troubled
she
liked
miss
fanny
she
could
not
bear
to
contemplate
her
in
the
guise
of
principal
one
could
never
like
miss
fanny
then
any
more
miss
fanny
mamma
had
cried
because
miss
fanny
was
a
teacher
emmy
lou
remembered
but
that
was
nothing
to
this
some
teachers
could
be
nice
miss
fanny
had
been
nice
but
to
be
a
principal
emmy
lou
had
known
but
one
type
she
looked
up
from
her
plate
i
reckon
miss
fanny
mamma
will
cry
some
more
said
emmy
lou
the
confines
of
consistency
aunt
louise
was
opposed
to
the
public
school
uncle
charlie
said
he
feared
aunt
louise
did
not
appreciate
the
democratic
institutions
of
her
country
emmy
lou
caught
the
word
democratic
later
she
had
occasion
to
consider
it
further
aunt
louise
said
that
uncle
charlie
was
quite
right
in
his
fear
and
the
end
was
that
emmy
lou
was
started
at
private
school
but
it
was
not
a
school
it
was
only
a
parlour
and
there
being
a
pupil
more
than
there
were
accommodations
and
emmy
lou
being
the
her
portion
was
a
and
a
there
was
not
even
a
real
teacher
only
an
old
lady
who
called
one
my
dear
at
home
emmy
lou
cried
with
her
head
buried
in
aunt
cordelia
new
bolster
sham
for
how
could
she
confess
to
hattie
and
to
rosalie
that
it
was
a
parlour
and
a
upon
consultation
uncle
charlie
said
let
her
do
as
she
pleased
since
damage
to
her
seemed
to
be
inevitable
either
way
so
emmy
lou
rejoicing
departed
one
morning
for
the
grammar
school
public
school
being
different
from
private
school
emmy
lou
at
once
began
to
learn
things
for
instance
at
grammar
school
one
no
longer
speaks
of
boys
in
undertones
one
assumes
an
attitude
of
having
always
known
boys
at
grammar
school
classes
attend
chapel
there
are
boys
in
chapel
still
separated
from
the
girls
to
be
sure
after
the
manner
of
the
goats
from
the
sheep
but
after
one
learns
to
laugh
from
the
corners
of
one
eyes
at
boys
a
dividing
line
of
mere
aisle
is
soon
abridged
watching
rosalie
emmy
lou
discovered
this
there
was
a
boy
in
chapel
whom
she
knew
but
it
takes
courage
to
look
out
of
the
corners
of
one
eyes
and
emmy
lou
could
only
find
sufficient
to
look
straight
which
is
altogether
a
different
thing
but
the
boy
saw
her
emmy
lou
looked
away
quickly
once
the
boy
name
had
been
billy
later
at
dancing
school
it
was
willie
now
the
principal
who
conducted
chapel
exercises
called
him
william
emmy
lou
liked
this
principal
he
had
white
hair
and
when
it
fell
into
his
eyes
he
would
stand
it
wildly
over
his
head
running
his
fingers
through
its
thickness
but
one
did
not
laugh
because
of
greater
interest
in
what
he
said
emmy
lou
asked
rosalie
the
principal
name
but
rosalie
was
smiling
backward
at
a
boy
as
the
classes
filed
out
of
chapel
afterward
she
explained
that
his
name
was
mr
page
at
grammar
school
emmy
lou
continued
to
learn
things
the
pupils
of
a
grammar
school
abjure
school
bags
a
geography
now
being
a
folio
volume
measurable
in
square
feet
it
is
the
thing
to
build
upon
its
basic
foundation
an
edifice
of
other
and
carry
the
sum
total
to
and
fro
on
an
aching
arm
nor
do
pupils
bring
lunch
they
bring
money
and
buy
lunch
pies
or
doughnuts
or
pickles
having
done
with
the
infant
pabulum
of
primary
bread
and
butter
nor
does
so
big
a
girl
as
a
pupil
longer
confess
to
any
infantile
abbreviation
of
entitlement
she
gives
her
full
baptismal
name
and
is
written
down
as
in
emmy
lou
case
emily
louise
pope
maclauren
which
has
its
drawbacks
for
she
sometimes
fails
to
recognise
the
unaccustomed
sound
of
that
name
when
called
unexpectedly
from
the
platform
for
at
twelve
years
an
emmy
lou
finds
herself
dreaming
and
watching
the
clouds
through
the
windows
the
reading
lesson
concerns
one
alnaschar
the
barber
fifth
brother
and
while
the
verses
go
droningly
round
the
kalsomined
blue
walls
fade
and
one
wanders
the
of
bagdad
amid
bales
of
rich
stuffs
and
trays
of
golden
trinkets
and
mysteries
that
trouble
not
purveyors
and
mussulmen
eunuchs
and
seraglios
khans
mosques
drachmas
one
has
no
idea
what
they
mean
nor
does
one
care
on
every
hand
in
life
lie
mysteries
why
not
in
books
the
thing
is
to
seize
upon
the
story
and
to
let
the
other
go
and
so
emily
louise
fails
to
answer
to
the
baptismal
fulness
of
her
name
spoken
from
the
platform
until
at
a
neighbour
touch
she
springs
up
blushing
illustration
one
finds
one
self
dreaming
and
watching
the
clouds
through
the
window
but
somehow
she
did
not
take
the
reproach
in
miss
amanda
voice
to
heart
miss
amanda
was
given
to
saying
reproachfully
please
young
many
times
a
day
but
after
a
brief
pause
one
returned
to
pleasant
converse
with
a
neighbour
jokes
were
told
about
miss
amanda
among
the
girls
and
gathering
at
recess
about
her
desk
her
pupils
would
banter
miss
amanda
as
to
who
was
her
favourite
whereupon
she
pleased
and
flattered
would
make
long
and
detailed
refutation
of
any
show
of
partiality
miss
amanda
pinned
a
bow
in
her
hair
and
wore
a
chain
and
rings
and
was
given
to
frequent
patting
and
pushing
of
her
hair
into
shape
was
it
possible
miss
amanda
felt
herself
to
be
ordinarily
however
emily
louise
did
not
think
much
about
her
one
way
or
another
except
at
those
times
when
miss
amanda
tried
to
be
funny
then
she
quite
hated
her
with
unreasoning
fierceness
right
now
miss
amanda
was
desiring
emily
louise
maclauren
to
give
attention

miss
amanda
pleased
and
flattered
would
make
long
detailed
refutation
of
any
show
of
partiality
once
a
week
there
was
public
recitation
in
the
chapel
mr
page
considered
it
good
for
boys
and
girls
to
work
together
which
was
a
new
way
of
regarding
it
peculiar
to
grammar
school
for
hitherto
boys
like
the
skull
and
bottles
in
aunt
cordelia
closet
had
been
things
to
be
avoided

miss

was
explaining
the

recitation

be
in
grammar
you
will
conjugate
miss
amanda
simpered
the
verb
to
love
with
playful
meaning
in
her
emphasis
but
i
need
have
no
fear
young
ladies
archly
that
you
will
let
yourselves
be
beaten
at
this
lesson
illustration
after
one
has
learned
to
smile
out
one
eyes
a
dividing
line
of
aisle
is
soon
bridged
miss
amanda
meant
to
be
funny
emily
louise
for
one
looked
stonily
ahead
not
for
anything
would
she
smile
but
the
weekly
recitation
varied
and
there
came
a
week
when
the
classes
were
assembled
for
a
lesson
in
composition
mr
page
laughed
at
what
he
called
flowery
effusions
use
the
matter
and
life
about
you
he
said
there
is
one
boy
he
went
on
to
state
whose
compositions
are
generally
good
for
that
reason
william
step
up
sir
and
let
us
hear
what
you
have
made
of
this
william
arose
he
was
still
square
but
he
was
no
longer
short
there
was
a
straight
and
handsome
bridge
building
to
his
nose
and
he
had
taken
to
tall
collars
william
face
was
somewhat
suffused
at
this
summons
to
publicity
but
his
smile
was
cheerful
and
unabashed
his
composition
was
on
conscience
so
were
the
compositions
of
the
others
but
his
was
different
a
boy
has
one
kind
of
a
conscience
read
william
and
a
girl
has
another
kind
two
girls
met
a
cow
her
right
in
the
face
and
pretend
like
we
are
afraid
said
the
biggest
girl
but
the
littlest
girl
had
a
conscience
it
be
deceiving
the
cow
she
wanted
to
know
emily
louise
blushed
how
could
william
for
emily
louise
was
the
littlest
girl
hattie
was
the
other
and
william
had
come
along
and
driven
the
cow
away
william
was
still
reading
there
was
a
girl
found
a
quarter
in
the
snow
she
thought
how
it
would
buy
five
pies
or
ten
doughnuts
or
fifteen
pickles
and
then
she
thought
about
the
person
who
would
come
back
and
find
the
place
in
the
snow
and
no
quarter
and
so
she
went
and
put
the
quarter
back
how
could
william
mr
page
his
hair
wildly
rumpled
was
clapping
hand
to
knee
even
the
teachers
were
trying
not
to
smile
emily
louise
blushed
hotter
for
emily
louise
taking
the
quarter
back
had
met
william
boys
are
different
stated
william
composition
there
was
a
boy
went
to
the
office
to
be
whipped
the
strap
hit
a
stone
in
his
pocket
so
the
principal
who
went
around
on
saturdays
with
a
hammer
tapping
rocks
let
the
boy
off
he
did
know
the
boy
got
the
rock
out
the
alley
on
purpose
but
i
reckon
boys
have
some
kind
of
a
conscience
that
boy
felt
sort
of
mean
it
was
the
teachers
who
were
laughing
now
while
mr
page
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
wore
a
smile
arrested
reflective
considering
but
it
broadened
there
are
principals
here
and
there
who
can
appreciate
a
william
the
cheek
of
emily
louise
might
be
hot
but
in
her
heart
was
a
newer
feeling
was
it
pleasure
something
somewhere
was
telling
emily
louise
that
william
liked
her
the
better
for
these
things
he
was
laughing
at
was
she
pleased
thereat
never
her
cheek
grew
hotter
yet
the
pleasurable
sensation
was
there
suddenly
she
understood
it
was
because
of
this
tribute
to
the
condition
of
her
conscience
of
course
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
therefore
to
determine
to
keep
up
this
reputation
with
william
there
was
other
proof
that
william
liked
her
at
grammar
school
it
was
the
proper
thing
to
own
an
autograph
album
william
page
in
the
album
of
emily
louise
was
a
triumph
in
purple
ink
upon
a
pinkish
background
not
that
william
had
written
it
jimmy
reed
had
written
it
for
him
jimmy
wielded
a
master
pen
in
flourish
and
shading
upon
which
he
put
a
price
accordingly
a
mere
name
cost
the
patrons
of
jimmy
a
pickle
while
a
pledge
to
eternal
friendship
or
sincerity
was
valued
at
a
doughnut
for
the
feelings
in
verse

paid
a
pie

william

paid
a

his

friendship
is
a
golden
knot
which
angles
hands

tied

heavenly
skill
its
textures

shall

emily
louise
wondered
about
the
angles
hands
what
were
they
it
never
suggested
itself
that
a
master
of
the
pen
such
as
jimmy
might
be
weak
in
spelling
one
has
to
meet
new
responsibilities
at
grammar
school
too
one
has
to
be
careful
with
whom
she
associates
associate
was
isobel
word
she
used
many
impressive
words
but
then
isobel
was
different
she
spelled
her
name
with
an
o
and
she
did
not
live
in
a
home
isobel
lived
in
a
hotel
and
her
papa
was
the
holder
of
a
government
position
hattie
papa
someone
told
emily
louise
had
wanted
to
hold
it
but
isobel
papa
got
it
isobel
said
a
person
must
discriminate
this
emily
louise
found
meant
move
in
groups
that
talked
each
about
the
others
isobel
and
rosalie
pointed
out
to
emily
louise
that
the
nice
girls
were
in
their
group
yet
hattie
was
not
in
it
emily
louise
wondered
why
it
depends
on
who
you
are
said
isobel
with
the
sweeping
calmness
of
one
whose
position
is
assured
my
papa
is
own
second
cousin
to
the
of
the
united
states
and
that
this
claim
conveyed
small
meaning
to
the
group
about
isobel
made
her
family
connections
by
no
means
the
less
impressive
and
to
be
envied
the
isobels
supply
their
part
of
the
curriculum
of
grammar
school
emily
louise
went
home
anxious
have
i
a
family
she
inquired
it
hard
to
say
since
you
abandoned
it
said
uncle
charlie
emily
louise
blushed
she
did
not
feel
just
happy
in
her
mind
yet
about
those
dolls
buried
in
a
trunk
in
the
attic
she
explained
the
kind
of
family
that
has
a
tree
did
she
belong
to
a
family
had
she
a
tree
the
only
copper
beech
in
town
said
uncle
charlie
but
aunt
cordelia
vulnerable
spot
was
touched
she
grew
quite
heated
emily
louise
learned
that
she
was
a
pringle
and
a
pope
and
a
maclauren
queried
emily
louise
but
aunt
cordelia
enthusiasm
had
cooled
there
came
a
time
when
emily
louise
divined
why
all
at
once
talk
began
at
school
about
a
thing
looming
ahead
called
an
election
it
seemed
a
disturbing
thing
keeping
uncle
charlie
at
the
office
all
hours
and
when
in
time
it
actually
arrived
emily
louise
could
not
go
to
school
that
day
because
the
way
would
take
her
past
the
polls
yet
ordinarily
this
was
only
the
grocery
but
so
dreadful
a
place
is
it
when
it
becomes
a
poll
that
aunt
cordelia
could
not
go
to
it
for
her
marketing
hitherto
except
when
miss
amanda
wanted
to
be
funny
emily
louise
had
felt
her
to
be
inoffensive
but
as
election
became
the
absorbing
topic
of
grammar
school
a
dreadful
thing
came
to
light
miss
amanda
was
a
republican
hattie
told
emily
louise
her
voice
was
low
and
full
of
horror
for
hattie
reflected
the
spirit
of
her
state
and
age
the
state
was
in
the
south
the
year
was
preceding
the
emily
louise
lowered
her
voice
too
it
was
to
ask
just
what
is
a
republican
she
was
conscious
of
a
vagueness
hattie
looked
at
her
amazed
a
republican
why
people
who
are
not
democrats
of
course
how
does
one
know
which
one
is
asked
emily
louise
feeling
that
it
would
be
disconcerting
considering
public
opinion
to
find
herself
a
republican
hattie
looked
tried
you
what
your
father
is
naturally
i
should
think
you
know
that
emily
louise
on
the
way
from
school
william
joined
emily
louise
what
a
republican
william
she
asked
his
countenance
changed
it
well
it
the
sort
you
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
said
william
darkly
emily
louise
knowing
how
william
regarded
her
conscientiousness
was
uneasy
because
of
a
certain
recollection
she
must
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
she
sought
aunt
louise
privately
are
you
a
democrat
she
inquired
the
indignant
response
of
aunt
louise
was
disconcerting
what
else
could
you
dream
i
am
she
demanded
with
asperity
you
said
you
did
approve
of
democratic
institutions
explained
emily
louise
recalling
i
approve
of
nothing
under
republican
domination
said
aunt
louise
haughtily
which
was
muddling
what
papa
asked
emily
louise
suddenly
aunt
louise
dressing
for
a
party
shut
her
door
sharply
one
could
ask
aunt
cordelia
but
aunt
cordelia
turned
testy
and
even
told
emily
louise
to
run
away
uncle
charlie
was
gone
there
was
aunt
and
tom
so
emily
louise
sought
the
kitchen
it
was
after
supper
tom
was
spelling
the
news
from
a
paper
spread
on
the
table
and
aunt
was

and
aunt
muttering
glared
at
tom
for
emily
louise
was
gazing
into
a
gulf
wider
than
the
river
rolling
between
home
and
papa
a
gulf
called
war
nor
did
emily
louise
know
as
aunt
knew
that
it
was
a
baby
little
fists
clutching
at
aunt
cordelia
that
had
bridged
that
gulf
emily
louise
turned
away
her
papa
was
that
thing
for
lowered
voice
and
bated
breath
her
papa
was
a
republican
then
emily
louise
was
a
republican
also
hattie
said
so
aunt
did
not
know
at
twelve
one
begins
determinedly
to
face
facts
yet
the
very
next
day
emily
louise
made
discovery
that
a
greater
than
her
papa
had
been
that
thing
for
lowered
tones
she
was
working
upon
her
weekly
composition
and
this
week
the
subject
was
george
washington
emily
louise
had
just
set
forth
upon
legal
cap
her
opening
conclusions
upon
the
matter
she
had
gone
deep
into
the
family
annals
of
george
for
by
nature
emily
louise
was
thorough
and
william
had
testified
that
she
was
conscientious
george
washington
was
a
great
man
and
so
was
his
mother
here
she
paused
pen
suspended
for
the
full
meaning
of
a
statement
in
the
history
spread
before
her
had
suddenly
dawned
upon
her
for
that
history
declared
george
washington
a
firm
advocate
for
these
republican
principles
should
an
emily
louise
then
turn
traitor
to
her
father
or
should
she
desert
an
aunt
cordelia
and
an
aunt
louise
life
is
complex
at
twelve
a
pucker
of
absorption
and
concentration
begins
to
gather
between
the
brows
on
the
homeward
way
william
was
waiting
at
the
corner
what
is
a
person
when
they
are
not
either
democrat
or
republican
emily
louise
asked
as
they
went
along
william
tones
were
uncompromising
a
mugwump
he
said
and
he
said
it
with
contempt
it
sounded
unpleasant
and
as
though
it
ought
to
merit
the
contempt
of
william
and
grammar
was
becoming
as
complex
as
life
itself
one
forenoon
emily
louise
was
called
upon
to
recite
the
rule
every
day
it
was
a
different
rule
which
in
itself
was
discouraging
but
the
exceptions
were
worse
than
the
rule
for
a
rule
is
a
matter
of
a
mere
paragraph
while
the
exceptions
are
measurable
by
pages
but
emily
louise
knew
the
rule
even
with
town
one
background
for
flag
and
bunting
even
with
the
streets
one
festive
processional
even
with
the
advent
in
her
city
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
on
his
tour
of
the
south
even
with
this
in
her
civic
precincts
emily
louise
arising
was
able
correctly
to
recite
the
rule
an
article
should
only
be
used
once
before
a
complex
description
of
one
and
the
same
object
an
example
said
miss
amanda
emily
louise
stood
perplexed
for
none
had
been
given
in
the
book
simply
apply
the
rule
and
make
your
own
said
miss
amanda
but
it
did
not
seem
simple
emily
louise
was
still
thinking
in
the
concrete
hattie
had
grasped
abstractions
hattie
waved
her
hand
there
was
a
scarlet
spot
upon
her
cheek
before
school
there
had
been
words
between
hattie
and
isobel
the
politics
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
figured
in
it
and
emily
louise
had
learned
that
the
president
was
a
republican
and
yet
flags
and
processions
miss
amanda
said
well
hattie
hattie
arose
there
is
a
single
only
solitary
republican
pupil
in
this
class
said
she
promptly
and
with
emphasis
miss
amanda
might
proceed
to
consider
the
proposition
grammatically
her
mind
being
on
the
rule
and
not
the
import
but
the
class
interpreted
it
as
hattie
meant
they
should
in
their
midst
and
unsuspected
emily
louise
grew
hot
could
hattie
would
hattie
do
this
thing
hattie
accuse
her
thus
yet
who
else
could
hattie
mean
the
heart
of
emily
louise
swelled
hattie
to
do
this
thing
and
hattie
was
wrong
she
should
know
that
she
was
wrong
she
should
read
it
in
her
own
autograph
album
just
brought
to
emily
louise
for
her
inscribing
emily
louise
remained
in
at
recess
verse
was
beyond
her
she
recognised
her
limitations
some
are
born
to
prose
and
some
to
higher
things
she
applied
herself
to
a
plain
statement
in
album
dear
hattie
i
am
a
mugwump
and
your
true
friend
emily
louise
maclauren
then
she
put
the
book
on
hattie
desk
as
the
bell
rang
with
the
class
came
a
visible
and
audible
excitement
mr
page
followed
his
hair
wildly
erect
and
he
conversed
with
miss
amanda
hurriedly
with
visual
signalling
and
labial
dumb
show
emily
louise
implored
enlightenment
ours
is
the
honour
class
so
we
to
be
chosen
enunciated
hattie
in
a
staccato
whisper
rosalie
was
nearer
there
to
be
a
presentation
in
the
chapel
whispered
rosalie
he
going
to
choose
us
now
mr
page
and
miss
amanda
were
surveying
the
class
some
two
score
pairs
of
eager
eyes
sought
each
to
stay
those
glances
upon
themselves
perhaps
mr
page
lacked
courage
the
choice
i
leave
to
you
said
he
to
miss
amanda
then
he
went
miss
amanda
was
also
visibly
excited
she
settled
her
chain
and
puffed
the
elaborate
coiffure
of
her
hair
the
while
she
continued
to
survey
the
class
she
looked
hesitant
and
undecided
glancing
from
row
to
row
then
as
from
some
inspiration
her
face
cleared
and
she
grew
arch
shaking
a
finger
playfully
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
she
said
with
sprightly
humour
and
it
will
at
least
narrow
the
choice
i
will
ask
those
young
ladies
whose
fathers
chance
to
be
of
a
republican
way
of
thinking
to
please
arise
a
silence
followed
a
silence
of
disappointment
to
the
many
then
emily
louise
maclauren
arose
was
retribution
following
thus
fast
because
of
that
subterfuge
of
mugwump
alas
for
that
conscientiousness
of
which
she
had
once
been
proud
was
it
the
measure
of
her
degradation
she
read
on
startled
face
rosalie
face
of
stricken
incredulity
and
amaze
but
no
rosalie
transfixed
gaze
was
not
on
emily
louise
it
passed
her
to
to
where
in
the
aisle
beyond
stood
another
isobel
but
the
head
of
isobel
was
erect
and
her
eyes
flashed
triumph
the
throw
of
isobel
shoulders
flung
defiance
back
in
the
moment
of
being
chosen
excitement
quivered
the
voice
of
miss
amanda
announcement
the
wife
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
young
ladies
having
signified
her
intention
of
visiting
our
school
the
young
ladies
standing
will
report
to
the
office
at
once
to
receive
instructions
as
to
their
part
in
the
programme
though
first
perhaps
did
miss
amanda
read
sex
through
self
a
little
smoothing
of
hair
and
ribbons
emily
louise
on
this
day
carried
her
news
home
doubtfully
for
aunt
louise
and
aunt
cordelia
were
of
such
violent
democracy
you
were
chosen
aunt
louise
repeated
isobel
to
make
the
speech
and
you
to
present
the
flowers
aunt
louisa
face
was
alight
with
excitement
and
inquiry
and
what
did
you
do
emmy
lou
i
gave
them
to
her
up
on
the
platform
it
was
a
pyramid
in
a
lace
paper
the
bouquet
and
then
aunt
louise
was
breathless
with
attention
she
kissed
me
said
emily
louise
on
the
cheek
aunt
louise
gave
a
little
laugh
of
gratification
and
pride
the
wife
of
the
president
why
emmy
lou
i
write
to
her
aunt
katie
this
very
afternoon
said
aunt
cordelia
better
look
to
the
family
tree
said
uncle
charlie
there
danger
of
too
rich
soil
in
these
public
honours
but
instead
emily
louise
went
out
and
sat
on
the
step
she
needed
solitude
for
the
readjustment
of
her
ideas
aunt
cordelia
was
pleased
and
aunt
louise
was
proud
and
emily
louise
with
the
kiss
of
republicanism
upon
her
cheek
had
stepped
down
from
the
chapel
platform
into
ovation
and
adulation
to
find
herself
the
centre
of
a
homeward
group
jostling
for
place
beside
her
hattie
had
carried
her
books
rosalie
her
jacket
william
had
nodded
to
her
at
one
corner
to
be
waiting
at
the
next
where
he
nodded
again
with
an
incidental
carelessness
of
manner
and
joined
the
group
emily
louise
had
stolen
a
glance
at
william
anxiously
had
opinion
of
her
fallen
it
would
seem
not
yet
isobel
had
gone
home
alone
emily
louise
had
seen
her
starting
with
sidewise
glance
and
lingering
saunter
should
any
be
meaning
to
overtake
her
but
she
had
gone
on
alone
because
she
never
told
said
hattie
until
she
wanted
to
be
chosen
said
rosalie
but
i
never
told
said
emily
louise
hattie
was
final
it
different
said
hattie
oh
very
said
rosalie
they
travel
through
labyrinthian
paths
who
seek
for
understanding
the
sun
went
down
the
dusk
grew
chill
emily
louise
sat
on
the
chin
in
palm
a
ballad
in
print
o
life
double
names
are
childish
things
therefore
emmy
lou
entered
the
high
school
as
emily
maclauren
her
disapproval
of
the
arrangements
she
found
there
was
decided
pupils
have
no
abiding
place
but
are
nomadic
in
their
habits
and
enforced
wanderers
between
shrines
of
learning
changing
quarters
as
well
as
teachers
for
every
recitation
and
the
constant
readjustment
of
mood
to
meet
the
varied
temperaments
of
successive
teachers
is
wearing
on
the
temper
yet
there
is
a
law
in
the
high
school
superior
to
that
of
the
teacher
at
the
dictates
of
a
gong
classes
arise
in
the
face
of
a
incompleted
peroration
and
depart
as
for
the
pupils
there
is
no
rest
for
the
soles
of
their
feet
a
freshman
in
the
high
school
is
a
mere
abecedarian
part
of
an
line
which
toils
weighted
with
pounds
of
up
and
down
the
stairways
of
knowledge
climbing
to
the
mansard
heights
for
rhetoric
to
descend
past
doors
to
which
it
must
later
return
to
the
foundation
floor
for
ancient
history
looking
back
at
the
undulating
line
winding
in
dizzy
spiral
about
the
stairways
emily
at
times
seemed
to
herself
to
be
a
vertebrate
part
of
some
long
monster
one
of
those
prehistoric
affairs
she
chose
her
figures
knowingly
for
she
was
studying
zoology
now
classes
went
to
the
laboratory
for
this
subject
filing
into
an
amphitheatre
of
benches
about
miss
carmichael
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
things
and
wasted
no
time
she
even
clipped
her
words
perhaps
that
they
might
not
impede
each
other
in
their
flow
which
lent
a
disconcerting
curtness
of
enunciation
to
an
amazing
rapidity
of
the
same
indeed
miss
carmichael
talked
so
fast
that
emily
got
but
a
blurred
impression
of
her
surroundings
carrying
away
a
dazed
consciousness
that
the
contents
of
certain
jars
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
lady
were
amphibian
in
their
nature
and
that
certain
other
objects
in
skin
leering
down
from
dusty
shelves
were
there
because
of
saurian
claims
and
because
man
is
a
vertebrate
having
an
internal
jointed
bony
skeleton
man
stood
in
a
glass
case
behind
the
oracular
priestess
of
the
place
in
awful
articulated
bony
whole
from
which
the
newly
initiated
had
constantly
to
drag
their
fascinated
shuddering
gaze
not
that
emily
wanted
to
look
indeed
she
had
no
time
to
be
looking
needing
it
all
to
keep
up
with
miss
carmichael
discoursing
in
unpunctuated
polysyllablic
flow
of
things
batrachian
and
things
reptilian
which
like
the
syllables
falling
from
the
lips
of
the
wicked
daughter
in
the
proved
later
to
be
toads
and
lizards
miss
carmichael
was
short
and
square
and
her
nose
was
large
she
rubbed
it
with
her
knuckle
like
a
man
she
had
rubbed
it
one
day
as
she
looked
at
emily
whom
she
had
called
upon
as
the
girl
who
answers
to
the
name
of
maclauren
it
was
not
a
flattering
way
to
be
designated
but
freshmen
learn
to
be
grateful
for
any
identity
then
too
miss
carmichael
was
famed
for
her
wit
and
much
is
to
be
overlooked
in
a
wit
which
in
another
might
seem
to
be
bad
manners
once
emily
had
been
hazy
about
the
word
but
now
she
knew
if
you
understand
at
once
it
is
not
wit
but
if
as
you
begin
to
understand
you
find
you
do
that
is
apt
to
be
wit
miss
carmichael
was
famed
for
hers
thus
called
upon
the
girl
who
answered
to
the
name
of
maclauren
stood
up
the
lecture
under
discussion
was
concerned
with
a
matter
called
perpetuation
of
type
under
fire
of
questions
it
developed
that
the
pupil
in
hand
was
sadly
muddled
over
it
under
such
circumstances
it
was
a
way
with
miss
carmichael
to
play
with
the
pupil
mystification
a
kitten
and
cry
mew
said
she
her
eyes
snapping
with
the
humour
of
it
why
mew
and
not
baa
why
does
the
family
of
cow
continue
to
wear
horns
why
indeed
there
was
any
sense
emily
felt
wild
miss
carmichael
here
evidently
decided
it
was
time
to
temper
glee
with
something
else
emily
was
prepared
for
that
having
discovered
that
wit
is
uncertain
in
its
humours
an
organ
not
exercised
loses
power
to
perform
its
function
think
said
miss
carmichael
have
you
taken
down
the
lecture
emily
had
taken
down
the
lecture
but
she
had
not
taken
in
the
lecture
she
looked
unhappy
i
do
think
i
understand
it
she
confessed
then
why
did
you
have
it
explained
i
did
try
which
was
true
for
emily
had
gone
with
questions
concerning
perpetuation
of
type
to
her
aunt
cordelia
what
did
you
want
to
know
demanded
miss
carmichael
about
about
the
questions
at
the
end
for
us
to
answer
about
that
one
makes
types
repeat
themselves
and
what
does
said
miss
carmichael
that
is
exactly
what
i
trying
to
find
out
emily
looked
embarrassed
aunt
cordelia
answer
was
the
same
one
that
she
gave
to
all
the
puzzling
but
emily
did
not
want
to
give
it
here
come
come
come
said
miss
carmichael
she
was
standing
by
her
table
and
she
rapped
it
sharply
and
what
does
god
said
emily
desperately
she
felt
the
general
embarrassment
as
she
sat
down
she
felt
hattie
give
a
quick
look
at
her
then
saw
her
glance
around
was
it
for
her
hattie
cheek
was
red
rosalie
with
her
cheek
crimson
was
looking
in
her
lap
in
the
high
school
some
have
passed
out
of
eden
while
others
are
only
approaching
the
fruit
of
the
tree
hattie
had
glanced
at
her
protectingly
and
though
emily
did
not
understand
just
why
she
was
glad
for
of
late
she
had
been
feeling
apart
from
hattie
and
estranged
from
rosalie
and
altogether
alone
and
aggrieved
hattie
now
wrote
herself
harriet
and
had
seemed
to
change
in
the
process
though
emily
who
had
once
been
emily
louise
herself
felt
she
had
not
changed
to
her
friends
but
hattie
was
one
to
look
facts
in
the
face
if
you
not
pretty
she
had
a
while
back
confided
to
emily
you
got
to
be
smart
and
forthwith
taking
to
learning
hattie
was
fast
becoming
a
shining
light
rosalie
had
taken
to
things
of
a
different
nature
which
she
called
romantic
situations
to
have
the
wind
whisk
off
your
hat
and
take
it
skurrying
up
the
street
just
as
you
meet
a
boy
is
a
romantic
situation
emmy
lou
had
no
sympathy
with
them
whatever
it
even
embarrassed
her
to
hear
about
them
and
caused
her
to
avoid
rosalie
eye
perhaps
rosalie
divined
this
for
she
took
to
another
thing
and
that
was
pauline
with
arms
about
each
other
the
two
walked
around
the
basement
promenade
at
recess
while
emily
stood
afar
off
and
felt
aggrieved
illustration
you
not
pretty
you
got
to
be
smart
she
was
doing
a
good
deal
of
feeling
these
days
but
principally
she
felt
cross
for
one
thing
she
was
having
to
wear
a
sailor
suit
in
which
she
hated
herself
it
takes
a
jaunty
juvenility
of
spirit
to
wear
a
sailor
suit
properly
and
she
was
not
feeling
that
way
these
days
she
was
feeling
tall
and
conscious
of
her
angles
the
tears
too
came
easily
as
at
thought
of
herself
deserted
by
hattie
and
rosalie
or
at
sight
of
herself
in
the
sailor
suit
it
was
in
aunt
cordelia
mirror
that
she
viewed
herself
with
such
dissatisfaction
but
while
looking
the
especial
grievance
was
forgotten
by
reason
of
her
gaze
centring
upon
the
reflected
face
she
was
wondering
if
she
was
pretty
but
even
while
her
cheek
flamed
with
the
thinking
of
it
she
forgot
why
the
cheek
was
hot
in
the
absorption
of
watching
it
fade
until
eyes
met
eyes
she
turned
quickly
and
hid
her
face
against
the
sofa
emmy
lou
had
met
self
but
later
she
almost
quarrelled
with
aunt
cordelia
about
the
sailor
suit
one
day
at
recess
a
who
had
entered
late
was
standing
around
her
cheek
was
pale
though
her
eager
look
about
lent
a
light
to
her
face
but
all
seemed
paired
off
and
absorbed
and
the
eager
look
faded
emily
whom
she
had
not
seen
moved
nearer
and
the
face
brightened
they
give
long
recesses
she
said
illustration
wondering
if
she
was
pretty
emily
felt
drawn
to
her
for
since
being
deserted
she
was
not
enjoying
recesses
herself
yes
she
said
they
do
and
the
next
day
another
pair
emily
and
the
joined
the
promenade
about
the
basement
the
new
pupil
name
was
margaret
that
is
since
it
stopped
being
maggie
emily
confessed
to
having
once
been
emmy
herself
with
a
middle
name
of
lou
besides
and
after
that
they
told
each
other
everything
margaret
loved
to
read
and
had
lately
come
to
own
a
certain
book
which
she
brought
to
lend
emily
and
over
its
pages
they
drew
together
the
book
was
called
percy
reliques
beside
the
common
way
lies
the
ballad
age
but
emily
would
have
passed
unknowing
had
not
margaret
drawing
the
branches
aside
revealed
it
and
into
the
sylvan
glades
she
stepped
pipes
and
tabret
luring
with
life
and
self
at
once
in
tune
and
then
margaret
told
her
something
if
she
would
never
never
tell
margaret
wrote
things
herself
it
was
about
this
time
that
rosalie
was
moved
to
seek
emily
as
of
old
to
relate
a
romantic
situation
she
warned
her
that
it
would
be
sad
but
emily
did
not
mind
that
she
loved
sad
things
these
days
and
even
found
an
exultation
in
them
if
they
were
very
very
sad
rosalie
took
her
aside
to
tell
it
there
was
a
bride
ready
even
to
her
veil
and
he
the
bridegroom
never
came
he
was
dead
rosalie
called
this
a
romantic
situation
emily
admitted
it
feeling
however
that
it
was
more
though
she
could
not
tell
rosalie
that
it
it
was
like
the
poetry
in
the
book
only
poetry
would
not
have
left
it
there
o
mither
mither
mak
my
bed
o
mak
it
saft
and
narrow
since
my
love
died
for
me
ise
die
for
him
it
about
a
teacher
right
here
in
the
high
school
rosalie
went
on
to
tell
then
it
was
true
which
one
asked
emily
but
that
rosalie
did
not
know
it
was
like
poetry
but
then
life
was
all
turning
to
poetry
now
one
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
mansard
now
with
winged
feet
for
rhetoric
is
concerned
with
metaphor
and
simile
and
rhetoric
treats
of
rhyme
there
is
a
sudden
meaning
in
learning
since
it
leads
to
a
desired
end
poetry
is
everywhere
around
the
prose
light
of
common
day
is
breaking
into
prismatic
rays
into
the
dusty
highway
of
ancient
history
all
at
once
sweeps
the
pageantry
of
mythology
philemon
bends
above
old
baucis
at
the
high
school
gate
though
hitherto
they
have
been
sycamores
olympus
is
just
beyond
the
clouds
the
elysian
fields
lie
only
the
surrender
of
the
will
away
if
one
but
droops
with
absent
eye
head
propped
on
hand
and
dreams
but
emily
all
at
once
is
conscious
that
miss
beaton
eyes
are
on
her
at
which
she
moves
suddenly
and
looks
up
but
this
teacher
with
the
sweet
strong
smile
is
but
gazing
absently
down
on
her
the
while
she
talks
emily
likes
miss
beaton
the
teacher
of
history
her
skirts
trail
softly
and
her
hair
is
ruddy
where
it
is
not
brown
she
forgets
and
when
she
rises
her
handkerchief
is
always
fluttering
to
the
floor
emily
loves
to
be
the
one
to
jump
and
pick
it
up
miss
beaton
handkerchiefs
are
fine
and
faintly
sweet
and
softly
crumpled
and
emily
loves
the
smile
when
miss
beaton
absent
gaze
comes
back
and
finds
her
waiting
but
what
is
this
she
is
saying
who
is
the
beautiful
youth
she
is
telling
about
adonis
beloved
did
she
say
and
wounded
wounded
unto
death
but
loved
and
never
forgotten
and
from
whose
blood
sprang
the
windswept
petals
of
anemone
miss
beaton
gaze
comes
back
to
her
and
she
takes
up
the
book
the
story
is
told
emily
had
not
known
that
her
eyes
had
filled
tears
come
so
these
days
until
the
ring
on
miss
beaton
hand
glistened
and
the
facets
of
its
jewel
broke
into
gleams
she
caught
her
breath
she
sat
up
suddenly
for
she
knew
all
at
once
she
knew
it
was
miss
beaton
who
had
been
the
bride
and
the
ring
was
the
sign
she
loved
miss
beaton
with
a
sudden
rapture
and
henceforth
gazed
upon
her
with
secret
adoration
she
made
excuses
to
consult
books
in
miss
beaton
room
that
she
might
be
near
her
she
dreamed
and
the
sweetness
and
the
sadness
of
it
centred
about
miss
beaton
she
told
rosalie
why
of
course
i
guessed
her
right
at
first
said
rosalie
but
she
said
it
jealously
for
she
too
was
secretly
adoring
miss
beaton
emily
had
been
trying
to
ask
margaret
something
but
each
time
the
question
stuck
in
her
throat
now
she
gathered
courage
it
was
spring
and
the
high
school
populace
turned
out
at
recess
to
promenade
the
yard
on
the
third
round
about
the
gravel
in
the
farthest
corner
where
a
lilac
bush
topping
the
fence
from
next
door
lent
a
sort
of
screen
and
privacy
emily
caught
margaret
by
the
arm
and
held
her
back
after
that
there
was
no
retreat
she
had
to
speak
how
how
do
you
do
it
she
asked
what
asked
margaret
write
said
emily
holding
to
margaret
tight
she
had
never
before
thus
laid
bare
the
secrets
of
her
soul
oh
said
margaret
and
her
lips
parted
and
her
face
lighted
as
she
and
emily
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
you
just
feel
it
and
then
you
write
there
was
a
time
when
emily
would
have
asked
feel
what
it
as
used
by
margaret
was
indefinite
but
emily
understood
you
just
feel
it
and
then
you
write
in
her
study
hour
emily
took
her
pencil
and
with
latin
grammar
as
barrier
and
blind
to
an
outside
world
bent
over
her
paper
she
did
not
speak
them
those
whispers
hunting
the
rhyme
she
only
felt
them
and
they
spoke
she
did
not
know
she
did
not
dream
that
she
was
finding
the
use
the
purpose
for
it
all
these
years
of
the
climb
toward
knowledge
some
day
it
would
dawn
on
her
that
we
only
garner
to
give
out
she
had
repeated
in
class
from
her
latin
grammar
but
she
did
not
understand
the
meaning
then
in
the
beginning
god
made
and
man
is
in
the
image
of
god
she
had
found
the
answer
to
her
discontent
for
to
create
to
give
out
is
the
law
she
wrote
on
head
bent
cheek
flushed
leaning
absorbed
above
the
paper
in
her
book
on
the
way
home
she
whispered
that
which
had
written
itself
while
her
feet
kept
time
to
the
rhythm
it
was
beautiful
and
sad
and
it
was
true
the
bride
and
her
maidens
sat
in
her
bower
she
nodded
to
william
loitering
near
the
high
school
gate
and
hurried
on
she
did
not
want
company
just
now
and
they
a
veil
and
their
laughter
was
sweet
as
the
orange
flower
that
breathed
on
the
soft
south
gale
but
here
william
caught
up
with
her
she
had
thought
he
would
take
the
hint
but
he
did
going
with
her
to
her
very
gate
but
once
inside
she
drew
a
long
breath
the
cherry
buds
were
swelling
and
the
sky
was
blue
she
took
up
her
verse
where
william
had
interrupted
the
bride
and
her
maidens
sit
in
her
bower
and
they
stitch
at
a
and
they
weep
as
the
breath
of
the
orange
flower
emily
is
so
absorbed
at
the
that
aunt
cordelia
is
moved
to
argue
about
it
she
go
to
school
if
she
does
not
eat
her
dinner
when
she
gets
home
and
that
beautiful
slice
of
good
roast
beef
untouched
says
aunt
cordelia
emily
frowned
being
intent
on
that
last
line
which
is
not
written
yet
she
is
hunting
the
rhyme
for
what
is
this
aunt
cordelia
is
saying
eat
meat
how
aunt
cordelia
it
throws
one
off
it
upsets
one
hattie
chanced
to
be
criticising
miss
beaton
the
next
day
saying
that
she
required
too
little
of
her
classes
but
then
she
is
more
concerned
getting
ready
to
be
married
i
reckon
said
hattie
oh
said
emily
hattie
she
was
shocked
almost
hurt
with
hattie
do
you
know
about
it
she
went
on
to
explain
she
was
going
to
be
married
and
he
he
never
came
he
was
dead
no
such
thing
said
hattie
he
runs
a
feed
store
next
my
office
we
got
cards
it
the
day
after
school
out
then
which
asked
emily
falteringly
why
i
heard
that
the
first
of
the
year
said
hattie
it
was
miss
carmichael
that
happened
to
emily
went
off
to
herself
she
felt
bitter
and
cross
and
disposed
to
blame
miss
beaton
she
never
wanted
to
see
or
to
hear
of
miss
beaton
again
upstairs
she
took
from
her
latin
grammar
a
pencilled
paper
interlined
and
much
erased
and
tore
it
into
bits
viciously
little
bits
then
she
went
and
put
them
in
the
basket
you
just
feel
it
and
then
you
write
margaret
had
said
and
emily
was
feeling
again
and
deeply
later
she
wrote
it
was
gloomy
that
which
wrote
itself
on
the
paper
nor
did
it
especially
apply
to
the
case
in
point
but
then
she
reminded
herself
bitterly
recalling
the
faithlessness
of
hattie
of
rosalie
of
miss
beaton
it
true
she
took
it
to
hattie
from
some
feeling
that
she
was
mixed
up
in
this
thing
hattie
closed
her
algebra
keeping
her
finger
in
the
place
while
she
took
the
paper
and
looked
at
it
she
did
not
seem
impressed
or
otherwise
but
read
it
aloud
in
a
tone
a
flower
sprang
from
the
earth
one
day
and
nodded
and
blew
in
a
blithesome
way
and
the
warm
sun
filled
its
cup
a
careless
hand
broke
it
off
and
threw
it
idly
down
where
it
lately
grew
and
the
same
sun
withered
it
up
said
hattie
what
the
up
for
you
do
need
it
it
it
for
the
rhyme
said
emily
it
redundancy
said
hattie
venus
or
minerva
it
was
gratifying
to
be
attached
to
a
name
again
as
a
freshman
personality
had
been
lost
in
the
high
school
by
reason
of
overwhelming
numbers
the
seems
always
to
be
and
valued
accordingly
but
progress
in
the
high
school
by
rigorous
enforcement
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
brings
ultimately
a
chance
for
identity
emmy
lou
a
survivor
found
a
personality
awaiting
her
in
her
sophomore
year
henceforth
she
was
to
be
miss
maclauren
the
year
brought
further
distinction
along
in
the
term
miss
maclauren
received
notification
that
she
had
been
elected
to
membership
in
the
platonian
society
on
account
of
recognised
literary
qualifications
the
note
set
forth
miss
maclauren
read
the
note
with
blushes
and
because
of
the
secret
joy
its
perusal
afforded
she
it
in
private
many
times
more
the
of
fame
are
sweet
and
as
an
athenian
might
have
regarded
an
invitation
into
olympus
so
miss
maclauren
looked
upon
this
opening
into
platonia
as
a
freshman
on
friday
afternoons
she
had
noted
certain
of
the
upper
pupils
strolling
about
the
building
after
dismissal
clothed
in
lieu
of
hats
and
jackets
with
large
importance
she
had
learned
that
they
were
platonians
and
from
the
of
the
she
had
watched
them
in
pairs
and
groups
mount
the
stairs
with
laughter
and
chatter
and
covert
backward
glances
she
did
not
wonder
she
would
have
glanced
backward
too
for
wherein
lies
the
satisfaction
of
being
elect
but
in
a
knowledge
of
the
envy
of
those
less
privileged
and
mounting
the
stairs
to
the
mansard
their
door
had
shut
upon
the
platonians
it
was
a
secret
society
and
now
this
door
stood
open
to
miss
maclauren
she
took
her
note
to
hattie
and
to
rosalie
who
showed
a
polite
but
somewhat
forced
interest
of
course
if
you
have
time
for
that
sort
of
thing
said
hattie
as
if
there
was
not
enough
of
school
and
learning
now
emily
said
rosalie
miss
maclauren
felt
disconcerted
the
bubble
of
her
elation
seemed
pricked
until
she
began
to
think
about
it
hattie
and
rosalie
were
not
asked
to
become
platonians
did
they
make
light
of
the
honour
because
it
was
not
their
honour
each
seeks
to
be
victor
in
some
field
of
achievement
but
each
is
jealous
of
the
other
field
hattie
thought
rosalie
frivolous
and
rosalie
scribbled
notes
under
the
nose
of
hattie
brilliant
recitations
miss
maclauren
on
the
neutral
ground
of
a
was
expected
by
each
to
furnish
the
admiration
and
applause
hattie
was
the
field
of
learning
and
she
stood
with
obstacles
trod
under
heel
crowned
with
honours
hattie
meant
to
be
valedictorian
some
day
nor
did
miss
maclauren
doubt
hattie
would
be
rosalie
was
a
different
field
hers
was
strewn
with
victims
victims
whose
names
were
boys
it
was
rosalie
field
miss
maclauren
in
her
heart
longed
to
enter
but
how
did
rosalie
do
it
she
raised
her
eyes
and
lowered
them
and
the
victims
fell
but
everyone
could
not
be
a
rosalie
and
hattie
looked
pityingly
upon
rosalie
way
of
life
and
rosalie
laughed
lightly
at
hattie
miss
maclauren
admired
hattie
but
secretly
she
envied
rosalie
if
she
had
known
how
she
herself
would
have
much
preferred
boys
to
brains
one
is
only
a
minerva
as
second
choice
to
be
sure
there
was
william
oh
william
he
is
taken
for
granted
and
besides
miss
maclauren
is
becoming
sensitive
because
there
was
no
one
but
william
the
next
day
she
was
approached
by
hattie
and
rosalie
who
each
had
a
note
they
mentioned
it
casually
but
hattie
tone
had
a
ring
was
it
satisfaction
and
rosalie
laugh
was
touched
with
gratification
for
the
notes
were
official
inviting
them
too
to
become
platonians
thinking
it
over
said
hattie
i
join
one
owes
something
to
it
so
alluring
the
sound
said
rosalie
a
secret
anything
miss
maclauren
thinking
it
over
herself
after
she
reached
home
that
day
suddenly
laughed
it
was
at
dinner
uncle
charlie
looked
up
at
his
niece
whom
he
knew
as
emmy
lou
not
as
yet
having
met
miss
maclauren
he
had
heard
her
laugh
before
but
not
just
that
way
generally
she
had
laughed
because
other
people
laughed
now
she
seemed
to
be
doing
it
of
herself
there
is
a
difference
emmy
lou
was
thinking
of
the
changed
point
of
view
of
hattie
and
rosalie
it
it
funny
she
explained
in
answer
to
uncle
charlie
look
no
said
uncle
charlie
and
you
see
it
well
what
on
earth
was
uncle
charlie
talking
about
i
congratulate
you
he
continued
it
will
never
be
so
hard
again
what
asked
emmy
lou
anything
said
uncle
charlie
what
was
he
talking
about
a
sense
of
humour
said
uncle
charlie
as
though
one
had
spoken
emma
lou
smiled
absently
some
of
uncle
charlie
joking
which
she
was
used
to
accepting
as
mystifying
but
it
was
funny
about
rosalie
and
hattie
she
was
smiling
again
and
she
felt
patronisingly
superior
to
them
both
miss
maclauren
was
still
feeling
her
superiority
as
she
went
to
school
the
next
morning
it
made
her
pleased
with
herself
it
was
a
frosty
morning
she
drew
long
breaths
she
felt
buoyant
and
scarcely
conscious
of
the
pavements
under
her
feet
at
the
corner
she
met
william
with
another
boy
she
knew
this
other
boy
but
that
was
all
he
had
never
shown
any
disposition
to
have
her
know
him
better
but
this
morning
things
were
different
william
and
the
other
boy
joined
her
william
taking
her
books
while
they
all
walked
along
together
miss
maclauren
felt
the
boy
take
a
sidewise
look
at
her
something
told
her
she
was
looking
well
and
an
intuitive
consciousness
that
the
boy
stealing
a
look
at
her
thought
so
too
made
miss
maclauren
look
better
illustration
at
the
high
school
gate
miss
maclauren
raised
her
eyes
again
her
spirits
soared
intoxicatingly
this
was
a
new
sensation
miss
maclauren
did
not
know
herself
the
sound
of
her
gay
chatting
and
laughter
was
strange
in
her
ears
perhaps
it
was
an
unexpected
revelation
to
the
others
too
william
was
not
looking
pleased
but
the
other
boy
was
looking
at
her
something
made
miss
maclauren
feel
daring
she
looked
up
suddenly
at
the
other
boy
square
to
be
sure
she
looked
down
quicker
that
part
being
involuntary
as
well
as
the
blush
that
followed
the
blush
was
disconcerting
but
the
sensation
on
the
whole
was
pleasurable
at
the
high
school
gate
miss
maclauren
raised
her
eyes
again
the
lowering
and
the
blush
could
be
counted
on
the
only
hard
part
was
to
get
them
raised
she
was
blushing
as
she
turned
to
go
in
she
was
laughing
too
to
hide
the
blush
and
this
was
the
elixir
of
which
rosalie
drank
it
mounted
to
the
brain
intuitively
miss
maclauren
knew
if
she
could
she
would
drink
of
it
again
she
looked
backward
over
her
shoulder
the
boy
was
looking
backward
too
hattie
had
said
that
rosalie
was
frivolous
that
her
head
was
turned
no
wonder
her
head
was
turned
the
next
friday
the
three
newly
elect
mounted
the
stairs
to
the
platonian
doorway
lofty
altitudes
are
expected
to
be
chilly
and
the
elevation
of
the
mansard
was
as
nothing
to
the
mental
heights
upon
which
platonia
was
established
platonian
welcome
had
an
added
chilliness
besides
by
reason
of
its
formality
the
new
members
hastily
found
seats
on
a
platform
sat
minerva
enthroned
no
wonder
for
she
was
a
senior
as
well
as
a
president
the
lesser
lights
on
either
side
it
developed
were
secretary
and
treasurer
they
looked
coldly
important
the
other
platonians
sat
around
the
society
was
asked
to
come
to
order
the
society
came
to
order
there
was
no
settling
and
and
rustling
and
tardy
subsidal
as
in
the
perhaps
because
the
young
ladies
in
this
case
wanted
the
order
it
went
on
though
miss
maclauren
was
conscious
that
for
her
part
she
comprehended
very
little
of
what
it
was
all
about
though
it
sounded
impressive
you
called
it
parliamentary
ruling
to
an
outsider
this
seemed
almost
to
mean
the
longest
way
round
to
an
end
that
everybody
had
seen
from
the
beginning
parliamentary
ruling
also
seemed
apt
to
lead
its
followers
into
paths
unexpected
even
by
them
from
which
they
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
and
it
also
led
to
revelations
humiliating
to
new
members
the
report
of
the
treasurer
was
called
for
it
showed
a
deficit
even
with
the
initiation
fees
and
dues
from
new
members
asked
the
president
even
so
then
said
the
president
we
have
to
elect
some
more
any
new
names
for
nomination
names
it
seemed
were
unflatteringly
easy
to
supply
and
were
rapidly
put
up
and
voted
upon
for
nomination
illustration
the
three
newly
elect
mounted
the
stairs
to
the
platonian
doorway
but
suddenly
a
platonian
was
upon
her
feet
she
had
been
counting
the
membership
was
limited
and
they
had
that
limit
the
nominations
were
unconstitutional
the
treasurer
at
this
was
upon
her
feet
reading
from
the
constitution
the
revenues
of
said
society
may
be
increased
only
by
payment
of
dues
by
new
members
she
paused
and
here
reminded
them
that
the
society
was
in
debt
discussion
waxed
hot
a
constitution
had
been
looked
upon
as
invulnerable
at
last
a
platonian
arose
she
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
time
was
passing
and
moved
that
the
matter
be
tabled
and
the
society
proceed
with
the
programme
for
the
day
fiercer
discussion
ensued
at
this
business
before
pleasure
said
a
sententious
member
what
a
programme
to
a
matter
concerning
the
constitution
itself
the
sponsor
for
the
motion
grew
sarcastic
it
developed
later
she
was
on
the
programme
since
the
business
of
the
society
was
only
useful
as
a
means
of
conducting
the
programme
which
was
the
primary
object
of
the
society
being
she
objected
to
the
classing
of
the
programme
as
unimportant
but
the
programme
was
postponed
when
people
begin
to
handle
red
tape
there
is
always
a
chance
that
they
get
enmeshed
in
its
voluminous
tangles
it
was
dark
when
the
society
adjourned
platonians
gave
up
dinner
and
friday
afternoons
to
the
cause
but
what
platonian
doubted
it
being
worth
it
miss
maclauren
and
hattie
walked
home
together
at
the
corner
they
met
a
boy
it
was
the
other
boy
whose
name
as
it
chanced
was
chester
he
joined
them
and
they
walked
along
together
something
made
miss
maclauren
cheek
quite
red
it
was
her
blush
when
the
boy
joined
them
a
few
steps
farther
on
they
met
miss
kilrain
the
new
teacher
at
the
high
school
it
was
just
as
miss
maclauren
was
laughing
an
embarrassed
laugh
to
hide
the
blush
miss
kilrain
looked
at
them
coldly
one
was
conscious
of
her
disapproval
miss
kilrain
name
had
been
up
that
very
afternoon
in
the
society
for
honorary
membership
all
teachers
were
made
honorary
members
with
the
sophomore
year
high
school
pupils
had
met
several
new
things
higher
education
was
one
of
them
they
met
it
in
the
person
of
miss
kilrain
it
looked
forbidding
she
lowered
her
voice
in
speaking
of
it
and
brought
the
words
forth
reverently
coupling
it
with
another
impressively
uttered
thing
which
she
styled
modern
methods
miss
kilrain
walked
mincingly
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
she
frequently
called
the
attention
of
her
classes
to
this
which
was
superfluous
for
so
ostentatiously
did
she
do
her
walking
one
could
not
but
be
aware
of
some
unnatural
quality
in
her
gait
but
miss
kilrain
that
they
might
remember
to
do
the
same
reminded
her
classes
so
often
they
all
took
to
walking
on
their
heels
human
nature
is
contrary
miss
kilrain
also
breathed
from
her
diaphragm
and
urged
her
pupils
to
try
the
same
do
you
do
it
rosalie
cautioned
emmy
lou
look
at
her
waist
miss
kilrain
came
into
the
high
school
with
some
other
new
things
the
new
there
had
been
violent
opposition
to
the
new
books
and
as
violent
fight
for
them
the
papers
had
been
full
of
it
and
emmy
lou
had
read
the
particulars
of
it
a
bryan
had
been
in
favour
of
the
change
emmy
lou
remembered
him
as
a
principal
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
things
bryan
was
quoted
in
the
papers
as
saying
modern
methods
are
the
oil
that
lubricates
the
wheels
of
progress
professor
koenig
who
was
opposed
to
the
change
was
principal
at
the
high
school
he
said
that
the
in
use
were
standards
and
that
the
latin
series
were
classics
just
what
is
a
classic
emmy
lou
had
asked
looking
up
from
the
paper
uncle
charlie
had
previously
been
reading
it
himself
professor
koenig
is
one
said
he
professor
koenig
was
little
his
beard
was
grizzled
and
the
dome
of
his
head
was
bald
he
wore
gold
spectacles
and
he
did
always
hear
at
which
times
he
would
bend
his
head
sideways
and
peer
through
his
glasses
hey
professor
koenig
would
say
but
he
knew
one
felt
that
he
knew
and
that
he
was
making
his
classes
know
too
one
was
conscious
of
something
definite
behind
professor
koenig
way
of
closing
the
book
over
one
forefinger
and
tapping
upon
it
with
the
other
it
was
a
purpose
what
then
did
uncle
charlie
mean
by
calling
professor
koenig
a
classic
just
what
does
it
mean
exactly
classic
persisted
emmy
lou
that
which
we
are
apt
to
put
on
the
shelf
said
uncle
charlie
oh
emmy
lou
had
thought
he
was
talking
about
professor
koenig
he
meant
the
she
understood
now
of
course
but
the
old
books
went
and
the
new
ones
came
and
miss
kilrain
came
with
them
she
came
in
mincingly
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
the
opening
day
of
school
and
took
her
place
on
the
rostrum
of
the
chapel
with
the
faculty
once
one
would
have
said
with
the
teachers
but
in
the
high
school
one
knew
them
as
the
faculty
miss
kilrain
took
her
place
with
them
but
she
was
not
of
them
the
high
school
populace
gazing
up
from
the
groundling
point
of
view
in
serried
ranks
below
felt
that
it
was
as
though
the
faculty
closed
in
upon
themselves
and
left
miss
kilrain
with
her
modern
methods
outside
and
alone
but
miss
kilrain
showed
a
proper
spirit
and
proceeded
to
form
her
intimacies
elsewhere
miss
kilrain
grew
quite
intimate
and
friendly
with
certain
of
the
girls
and
now
her
name
had
come
up
for
honorary
membership
in
the
platonian
society
we
always
extended
it
to
the
faculty
a
member
reminded
them
besides
she
wo
bother
us
remarked
another
they
never
come
miss
kilrain
was
accorded
the
honour
but
she
surprised
them
she
did
come
she
came
tripping
up
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
the
very
next
friday
they
heard
her
deprecating
little
cough
as
she
came
up
the
stairs
when
one
was
little
one
had
played
let
pretend
but
in
the
full
illusion
of
the
playing
if
people
had
appeared
the
play
stopped
short
it
was
like
that
now
the
silence
oh
said
miss
kilrain
in
the
doorway
go
on
or
i
go
away
they
went
on
lamely
enough
but
they
never
went
on
again
miss
kilrain
ever
after
went
on
for
them
and
perforce
they
followed
but
they
went
on
the
secretary
had
been
reading
a
communication
it
was
from
the
literary
society
of
the
boy
high
school
proposing
a
debate
between
the
two
it
was
signed
by
the
secretary
who
chanced
to
be
a
boy
whose
name
was
chester
miss
maclauren
in
spite
of
herself
grew
red
she
had
been
talking
about
the
platonians
and
their
debates
with
him
quite
recently
the
effect
of
the
note
upon
the
platonians
was
visible
a
tremendous
fluttering
agitated
the
members
it
was
a
proposition
calculated
to
agitate
them
rosalie
was
on
that
side
opposed
to
the
matter
why
was
obvious
for
rosalie
preferred
to
shine
before
boys
and
she
would
not
shine
in
debate
hattie
was
warmly
in
favour
of
it
for
she
was
one
who
would
shine
miss
maclauren
did
not
express
herself
but
when
it
came
to
the
vote
miss
maclauren
said
aye
the
ayes
had
it
then
all
at
once
the
platonians
became
aware
of
miss
kilrain
whom
they
had
momentarily
forgotten
miss
kilrain
was
sitting
in
deprecating
silence
and
the
platonians
had
a
sudden
consciousness
that
it
was
the
silence
of
disapproval
she
sat
with
the
air
and
the
compressed
lips
of
one
who
could
say
much
but
since
her
opinion
is
not
asked
but
just
before
adjournment
miss
kilrain
lips
unclosed
as
she
arose
apologetically
and
begged
permission
to
address
the
chair
she
then
acknowledged
her
pleasure
at
the
compliment
of
her
membership
and
expressed
herself
as
gratified
with
the
earnestness
with
which
some
of
the
members
were
regarding
this
voluntarily
chosen
opportunity
for
these
she
was
sorry
to
see
were
in
the
minority
as
for
herself
she
must
express
disapproval
of
the
proposed
debate
with
the
young
gentlemen
of
the
male
high
school
it
could
but
lead
to
frivolity
and
she
was
sorry
to
see
so
many
in
favour
of
it
young
ladies
whose
minds
are
given
to
boys
and
frivolity
are
not
the
material
of
which
to
make
a
literary
society
as
she
spoke
miss
kilrain
looked
steadily
at
two
members
sitting
side
by
side
both
had
voted
for
the
debate
and
both
had
been
seen
by
miss
kilrain
one
at
least
laughing
frivolously
in
company
with
a
boy
the
two
members
moving
uneasily
beneath
miss
kilrain
gaze
were
hattie
and
miss
maclauren
miss
kilrain
then
went
on
to
say
that
she
had
taught
in
another
school
a
school
where
the
ideals
of
higher
education
were
being
realised
by
the
use
of
modern
methods
the
spirit
of
this
school
had
been
earnestness
and
this
spirit
had
found
voice
in
a
school
paper
as
a
worthier
field
for
the
talent
she
recognised
in
the
platonian
society
miss
kilrain
now
proposed
this
society
start
a
paper
which
should
be
the
organ
for
the
school
it
was
only
a
suggestion
but
did
it
appeal
to
the
talent
she
recognised
before
her
they
could
bear
in
mind
that
she
stood
ready
to
assist
them
with
the
advice
and
counsel
of
one
experienced
in
the
work
going
down
stairs
miss
kilrain
put
her
arm
about
one
of
the
girls
and
said
it
was
a
thing
she
admired
an
earnest
young
spirit
the
girl
was
rosalie
who
blushed
and
looked
embarrassed
that
meeting
was
the
last
of
the
platonian
gatherings
that
might
be
called
personally
conducted
the
platonians
hardly
knew
whether
they
wanted
a
paper
or
not
when
they
found
themselves
full
in
the
business
of
making
one
miss
kilrain
was
the
head
and
front
of
things
she
marshalled
her
forces
with
the
air
of
one
who
knows
what
she
wants
her
forces
were
that
part
of
the
society
which
had
voted
against
the
debate
miss
kilrain
was
one
of
those
who
must
lead
at
something
if
she
could
not
be
leader
on
the
rostrum
she
descended
to
the
ranks
miss
maclauren
was
deeply
interested
and
felt
she
had
a
right
to
be
for
these
things
newspapers
and
such
were
in
her
family
considering
her
recognised
literary
qualifications
she
even
had
secret
aspirations
toward
a
position
on
the
staff
on
a
scrap
of
paper
in
class
she
had
surreptitiously
tried
her
hand
on
a
tentative
editorial
after
this
fashion
it
is
our
desire
to
state
at
the
start
that
this
paper
does
not
intend
to
dabble
in
the
muddy
pool
of
politics
miss
maclauren
heartily
indorsed
the
proposed
paper
and
like
miss
kilrain
felt
that
it
would
be
a
proper
field
for
unused
talent
but
her
preference
for
a
staff
position
was
not
consulted
rosalie
however
became
part
of
that
body
rosalie
was
a
favourite
with
miss
kilrain
hattie
the
hitherto
shining
light
was
detailed
to
secure
subscribers
was
this
all
that
honours
in
algebra
latin
and
chemistry
could
do
for
one
miss
maclauren
found
herself
on
a
committee
for
advertisements
by
means
of
advertisements
miss
kilrain
proposed
to
make
the
paper
pay
for
itself
the
treasurer

of
a
proper
anxiety
over
this
question
of
expenditure

in
his
shirt
sleeves
they
looked
up
the
fourth
man
was
in
a
revolving
chair
he
was
in
shirt
sleeves
too
and
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
his
face
was
red
and
his
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
well
said
the
man
revolving
just
enough
to
see
them
he
looked
cross
lucy
explained
her
cheeks
were
very
red
now
at
first
the
man
was
testy
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
lucy
cheeks
were
redder
so
emmy
lou
came
forward
thinking
she
might
make
it
plainer
she
was
blushing
too
they
both
explained
they
both
gazed
at
the
man
eagerly
while
they
explained
they
both
looked
pretty
but
then
they
did
not
know
that
the
man
wheeled
round
a
little
more
and
listened
then
he
got
up
he
pushed
his
hat
back
and
scratched
his
head
and
nodded
as
he
surveyed
them
then
he
put
a
hand
in
pocket
and
pursed
his
lips
as
he
looked
down
on
them
and
what
am
i
to
get
if
i
give
you
the
advertisement
asked
the
man
he
was
smiling
jocosely
and
here
he
pinched
lucy
cheek
playfully
between
a
thumb
and
forefinger
emmy
lou
had
kept
her
wits
she
carried
much
paraphernalia
under
her
arm
miss
kilrain
had
posted
them
thoroughly
as
to
their
business
and
what
then
do
i
get
repeated
the
man
emmy
lou
was
producing
a
paper
a
receipt
said
emmy
lou
the
man
shouted
so
did
the
other
men
emmy
lou
and
lucy
were
bewildered
it
worth
the
price
said
the
man
he
promised
them
the
advertisement
and
walked
back
through
the
store
with
them
to
the
outer
door
come
again
said
the
man
on
the
way
to
the
next
place
they
met
emmy
lou
uncle
charlie
it
was
near
his
office
he
was
a
pleasant
person
to
meet
downtown
as
it
usually
meant
a
visit
to
a
certain
alluring
he
was
feeling
even
now
in
his
change
pocket
as
he
came
up
how
now
said
he
and
where
to
emmy
lou
explained
she
had
not
happened
to
mention
this
part
about
the
paper
at
home
what
said
uncle
charlie
you
have
been
say
that
over
again
emmy
lou
said
it
over
again
no
more
advertisements
were
secured
that
morning
no
more
were
solicited
emmy
lou
found
herself
going
home
with
a
lump
in
her
throat
uncle
charlie
had
never
spoken
to
her
in
that
tone
before
lucy
had
gone
on
to
her
father
store
as
uncle
charlie
had
suggested
she
ask
permission
before
she
seek
business
farther
there
were
others
of
uncle
charlie
way
of
thinking
on
monday
the
platonians
were
requested
to
meet
professor
koenig
in
his
office
professor
koenig
was
kindly
but
final
he
had
just
heard
of
the
paper
and
its
methods
he
had
aimed
to
conduct
his
school
on
different
lines
it
was
his
request
that
the
matter
be
dropped
miss
kilrain
was
indignant
she
was
excited
she
was
excited
and
unguarded
miss
kilrain
said
more
perhaps
than
she
realised
he
only
helping
to
pull
the
roof
down
on
his
own
head
said
miss
kilrain
it
only
another
proof
of
his
inability
to
adapt
himself
to
modern
methods
next
month
was
december
the
high
school
adjourned
for
the
holidays
but
the
platonians
were
busy
they
were
preparing
for
a
debate
a
debate
with
the
high
school
boys
professor
koenig
had
thought
the
debate
an
excellent
thing
and
offered
his
library
to
the
society
for
use
in
preparation
saying
that
a
friendly
rivalry
between
the
two
schools
would
be
an
excellent
and
stimulating
thing
these
days
miss
kilrain
was
holding
aloof
from
the
society
and
its
deteriorating
tendencies
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
at
the
members
sorrowfully
the
debate
was
set
for
the
first
friday
in
the
new
year
one
morning
in
the
holidays
uncle
charlie
looked
up
from
his
paper
you
are
going
to
have
a
new
principal
said
he
new
principal
said
emmy
lou
and
professor
koenig
like
other
classics
said
uncle
charlie
he
is
being
put
on
the
shelf
they
have
asked
him
to
resign
and
who
is
the
new
one
asked
emmy
lou
the
gentleman
named
as
likely
is
professor
bryan
oh
said
emmy
lou
no
i
am
of
the
opinion
therefore
said
uncle
charlie
that
the
mercurial
gazette
will
make
its
appearance
yet
if
it
is
professor
bryan
said
emmy
lou
there
no
need
of
my
working
any
more
on
the
debate
why
not
said
uncle
charlie
if
it
bryan
he
never
let
them
come
he
thinks
they
are
awful
things
boys
miss
maclauren
was
right
about
it
the
debate
did
not
take
place
platonian
affairs
seemed
suddenly
tame
would
a
strictly
feminine
olympus
pall
she
came
into
aunt
cordelia
room
one
afternoon
there
to
be
a
dancing
club
on
friday
evenings
she
explained
and
i
invited
which
was
doubly
true
for
both
william
and
chester
had
asked
her
she
was
used
to
having
william
say
he
come
round
and
go
along
she
had
had
a
boy
join
her
and
walk
home
but
this
you
ca
do
it
all
said
aunt
cordelia
positively
that
society
keeps
you
till
dark
illustration
she
stood
fingering
the
window
curtain
irresolute
emmy
lou
knew
when
aunt
cordelia
tones
were
final
she
had
feared
this
she
stood
fingering
the
irresolute
in
her
heart
she
felt
her
literary
qualifications
were
not
being
appreciated
in
platonian
circles
anyway
a
dancing
club
it
sounded
alluring
the
window
was
near
the
bureau
with
its
mirror
she
stole
a
look
she
was
yes
she
knew
now
she
was
pretty
late
that
afternoon
miss
maclauren
dropped
a
note
in
the
post
it
was
a
note
tendering
her
resignation
to
the
platonian
society
the
end
