chapter
i
the
birthday
i
about
thirty
years
ago
there
was
at
the
top
of
the
side
of
orange
street
in
polchester
a
large
stone
house
i
say
was
the
shell
of
it
is
still
there
and
the
people
who
now
live
in
it
are
quite
unaware
i
suppose
that
anything
has
happened
to
the
inside
of
it
except
that
they
are
certainly
assured
that
their
furniture
is
vastly
superior
to
the
furniture
of
their
predecessors
they
have
a
gramophone
a
pianola
and
a
lift
to
bring
the
plates
from
the
kitchen
into
the
and
a
small
motor
garage
at
the
back
where
the
old
pump
used
to
be
and
a
very
modern
rock
garden
where
once
was
the
pond
with
the
fountain
that
never
worked
let
them
cherish
their
satisfaction
no
one
grudges
it
to
them
the
coles
were
by
modern
standards
people
and
the
stone
house
was
an
house
young
jeremy
cole
was
born
there
in
the
year
very
early
in
the
morning
of
december
he
was
still
there
very
early
in
the
morning
of
december
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
the
cuckoo
clock
had
just
struck
five
and
he
was
aware
that
he
was
at
this
very
moment
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
eight
years
old
he
had
gone
to
bed
at
eight
on
the
preceding
evening
with
the
choking
consciousness
that
he
would
awake
in
the
morning
a
different
creature
although
he
had
slept
there
had
permeated
the
texture
of
his
dreams
that
same
choking
excitement
and
now
wide
awake
as
though
he
had
asked
the
cuckoo
to
call
him
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
late
for
the
great
occasion
he
stared
into
the
black
distance
of
his
bedroom
and
reflected
with
a
beating
heart
upon
the
great
event
he
was
eight
years
old
and
he
had
as
much
right
now
to
the
nursery
with
a
hole
in
it
as
helen
had
that
was
his
first
definite
realisation
of
approaching
triumph
throughout
the
whole
of
his
seventh
year
he
had
fought
with
helen
who
was
most
unjustly
a
year
older
than
he
and
persistently
proud
of
that
injustice
as
to
his
right
to
use
the
wicker
whensoever
it
pleased
him
so
destructive
of
the
general
peace
of
the
house
had
these
incessant
battles
been
so
unavailing
the
suggestions
of
elderly
relations
that
gentlemen
always
yielded
to
ladies
that
a
compromise
had
been
arrived
at
when
jeremy
was
eight
he
should
have
equal
rights
with
helen
well
and
good
jeremy
had
yielded
to
that
it
was
the
only
decent
chair
in
the
nursery
into
the
place
where
the
wicker
yielding
to
rude
and
impulsive
pressure
had
fallen
away
one
body
might
be
most
happily
fitted
it
was
of
exactly
the
right
height
it
made
the
handsomest
creaking
noises
when
one
rocked
in
it
and
in
any
case
helen
was
only
a
girl
but
the
sense
of
his
triumph
had
not
yet
fully
descended
upon
him
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
yawning
with
a
tickle
in
the
middle
of
his
back
and
his
throat
very
dry
he
was
disappointingly
aware
that
he
was
still
the
same
jeremy
of
yesterday
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
exactly
that
he
had
expected
but
he
did
not
feel
at
present
that
confident
proud
glory
for
which
he
had
been
prepared
perhaps
it
was
too
early
he
turned
round
curled
his
head
into
his
arm
and
with
a
statement
about
the
wicker
chair
he
was
once
again
asleep
ii
he
awoke
to
the
customary
sound
of
the
bath
water
running
into
the
bath
his
room
was
flooded
with
sunshine
and
old
jampot
the
nurse
her
name
was
preston
and
her
shape
was
jampot
was
saying
as
usual
now
master
jeremy
eight
no
lying
in
bed
out
you
get
bath
he
stared
at
her
blinking
you
should
say
happy
returns
of
the
day
master
jeremy
he
remarked
then
suddenly
with
a
leap
he
was
out
of
bed
had
crossed
the
floor
pushed
back
the
nursery
door
and
was
sitting
in
the
wicker
his
naked
feet
kicking
a
triumphant
dance
helen
helen
he
called
i
in
the
no
sound
i
eight
he
shouted
and
i
in
the
preston
breathless
and
exclaiming
hurried
across
to
him
oh
you
naughty
boy
death
of
cold
in
your
i
eight
he
said
looking
at
her
scornfully
and
i
can
sit
here
as
long
as
i
helen
her
pigtails
flapping
on
either
shoulder
her
nose
red
as
it
always
was
early
in
the
morning
appeared
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
nursery
nurse
he
must
must
he
tell
him
not
to
i
do
care
how
old
you
are
it
my
chair
mother
said
no
she
did
mother
said
yes
she
did
mother
said
mother
said
that
when
oh
you
story
you
know
that
mother
said
then
suddenly
a
new
stiffening
trusting
dignity
filled
him
as
though
he
had
with
a
turn
of
the
head
discovered
himself
in
golden
armour
he
was
above
this
vulgar
wrangling
now
that
was
for
girls
he
was
superior
to
them
all
he
got
down
from
the
chair
and
stood
his
head
up
on
the
old
turkey
rug
red
with
yellow
cockatoos
in
front
of
the
roaring
fire
you
may
have
your
old
chair
he
said
to
helen
i
eight
now
and
i
do
want
it
any
more
although
if
i
do
want
it
i
shall
have
it
he
added
he
was
a
small
square
boy
with
a
face
his
hair
was
light
brown
thin
and
stiff
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
brush
and
although
you
watered
it
stood
up
in
unexpected
places
and
stared
at
you
his
eyes
were
good
dark
brown
and
large
but
he
was
in
no
way
handsome
his
neck
his
nose
ridiculous
his
mouth
was
too
large
and
his
chin
stuck
out
like
a
hammer
he
was
plainly
obstinate
and
possibly
sulky
although
when
he
smiled
his
whole
face
was
lighted
with
humour
helen
was
the
only
beautiful
cole
child
and
she
was
abundantly
aware
of
that
fact
the
coles
had
never
been
a
family
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fireplace
now
as
he
had
seen
his
father
do
his
short
legs
apart
his
head
up
and
his
hands
behind
his
back
now
master
jeremy
the
jampot
continued
you
may
be
eight
years
old
but
it
is
a
reason
for
disobedience
the
very
first
minute
and
of
course
your
bath
is
ready
and
you
catching
your
death
with
naked
feet
which
you
always
been
told
to
put
your
slippers
on
and
not
to
keep
the
bath
waiting
when
there
miss
helen
and
miss
mary
as
you
very
well
know
and
breakfast
coming
in
five
minutes
which
there
sausages
this
morning
because
it
your
birthday
and
them
all
getting
cold
sausages
he
was
across
the
floor
in
a
moment
had
thrown
off
his
nightshirt
and
was
in
his
bath
sausages
he
was
translated
into
a
world
of
excitement
and
splendour
they
had
sausages
so
seldom
not
always
even
on
birthdays
and
on
a
cold
morning
with
a
crackling
fire
and
marmalade
perhaps
and
then
all
the
presents
oh
he
was
happy
as
he
rubbed
his
back
with
the
towel
a
wonderful
glowing
christian
charity
spread
from
his
head
to
his
toes
and
tingled
through
every
inch
of
him
helen
should
sit
in
the
chair
when
she
pleased
mary
should
be
allowed
to
dress
and
undress
the
large
woollen
dog
known
as
sulks
his
own
especial
and
beloved
property
so
often
as
she
wished
jampot
should
poke
the
twisted
end
of
the
towel
in
his
ears
and
brush
his
hair
with
the
hard
brushes
and
he
would
not
say
a
word
aunt
mary
should
kiss
him
as
of
course
she
would
want
to
do
and
he
would
not
shiver
he
would
bravest
deed
of
all
allow
mary
to
read
alice
in
wonderland
in
her
voice
so
long
as
ever
she
wanted
sausages
sausages
in
his
shirt
and
his
short
blue
trousers
his
hair
on
end
tugging
at
his
braces
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
shouted
helen
there
are
sausages
because
it
my
birthday
are
you
glad
and
even
when
the
only
response
to
his
joyous
invitation
was
voice
crossly
admonishing
the
jampot
oh
you
do
pull
so
hurting
his
charity
was
not
checked
then
when
he
stood
clothed
and
of
a
cheerful
mind
once
more
in
front
of
the
fire
a
shyness
stole
over
him
he
knew
that
the
moment
for
presents
was
approaching
he
knew
that
very
shortly
he
would
have
to
kiss
and
be
kissed
by
a
multitude
of
persons
that
he
would
have
to
say
again
and
again
oh
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
that
he
would
have
his
usual
consciousness
of
his
inability
to
thank
anybody
at
all
in
the
way
that
they
expected
to
be
thanked
helen
and
mary
never
worried
about
such
things
they
delighted
in
kissing
and
hugging
and
multitudes
of
words
if
only
he
might
have
had
his
presents
by
himself
and
then
stolen
out
and
said
thank
you
to
the
lot
of
them
and
have
done
with
it
he
watched
the
with
increasing
satisfaction
the
large
teapot
with
the
red
roses
the
dark
blue
porridge
plates
the
glass
jar
with
the
marmalade
a
rich
yellow
inside
it
the
huge
loaf
with
the
soft
pieces
bursting
out
between
the
crusty
pieces
the
solid
square
of
butter
so
beautiful
a
colour
and
marked
with
a
large
cow
and
a
tree
on
the
top
he
had
seen
once
in
the
kitchen
the
wooden
shape
with
which
the
cook
made
this
handsome
thing
there
were
also
his
own
silver
mug
given
him
at
his
christening
by
canon
trenchard
his
godfather
and
his
silver
spoon
given
him
on
the
same
occasion
by
uncle
samuel
all
these
things
glittered
and
glowed
in
the
firelight
and
a
kettle
was
singing
on
the
hob
and
martha
the
canary
was
singing
in
her
cage
in
the
window
no
one
really
knew
whether
the
canary
were
a
lady
or
a
gentleman
but
the
name
had
been
martha
after
a
beloved
housemaid
now
married
to
the
gardener
and
the
sex
had
followed
the
name
there
were
also
all
the
other
familiar
nursery
things
the
hole
in
the
turkey
carpet
near
the
bookcase
the
very
shiny
where
you
sit
and
very
as
to
its
tail
the
doll
house
now
deserted
because
helen
was
too
old
and
mary
too
clever
the
pictures
of
church
on
christmas
morning
everyone
with
their
mouths
very
wide
open
singing
a
christmas
hymn
with
holly
dignity
and
impudence
after
landseer
the
shepherds
and
the
angels
and
the
charge
of
the
light
so
packed
was
the
nursery
with
history
for
jeremy
that
it
would
have
taken
quite
a
week
to
relate
it
all
there
was
the
spot
where
he
had
bitten
the
jampot
fingers
for
which
deed
he
had
afterwards
been
slippered
by
his
father
there
the
corner
where
they
stood
for
punishment
he
knew
exactly
how
many
ships
with
sails
how
many
ridges
of
waves
and
how
many
setting
suns
there
were
on
that
especial
piece
of
corner
wallpaper
three
ships
twelve
ridges
two
and
a
half
suns
there
was
the
place
where
he
had
broken
the
ink
bottle
over
his
shoes
and
the
carpet
there
by
the
window
where
mary
had
read
to
him
once
when
he
had
toothache
and
he
had
not
known
whether
her
reading
or
the
toothache
agonised
him
the
more
and
so
on
an
endless
sequence
of
sensational
history
his
reminiscences
were
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
gladys
with
the
porridge
gladys
who
was
only
the
but
was
nevertheless
stout
breathless
from
her
climb
and
the
sentiment
of
the
occasion
produced
from
a
deep
pocket
a
dirty
envelope
which
she
laid
upon
the
table
many
returns
master
giggle
giggle
lord
save
us
if
i
gone
and
forgotten
they
spunes
and
she
vanished
the
had
begun
he
had
an
instant
struggle
as
to
whether
it
were
better
to
wait
until
all
the
presents
had
accumulated
or
whether
he
would
take
them
separately
as
they
arrived
the
dirty
envelope
lured
him
he
advanced
towards
it
and
seized
it
he
could
not
read
very
easily
the
sprawling
writing
on
the
cover
but
he
guessed
that
it
said
from
gladys
to
master
within
was
a
marvellous
card
tied
together
with
glistening
cord
and
shining
with
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
it
was
apparently
a
survival
from
last
christmas
as
there
was
a
church
in
snow
and
a
peal
of
bells
he
was
nevertheless
very
happy
to
have
it
after
his
introduction
events
moved
swiftly
first
helen
and
mary
appeared
their
faces
shining
and
solemn
and
mysterious
helen
and
mary
staring
through
her
spectacles
like
a
profound
owl
because
jeremy
had
known
mary
ever
since
he
could
remember
he
was
unaware
that
there
was
anything
very
peculiar
about
her
but
in
truth
she
was
a
strange
looking
child
very
thin
she
had
a
large
head
with
big
outstanding
ears
spectacles
and
yellow
hair
pulled
back
and
her
large
hands
were
always
red
and
her
forehead
was
freckled
she
was
as
plain
a
child
as
you
were
ever
likely
to
see
but
there
was
character
in
her
mouth
and
eyes
and
although
she
was
only
seven
years
old
she
could
read
quite
difficult
books
she
was
engaged
at
this
particular
time
upon
ivanhoe
and
she
was
a
genius
at
sums
the
passion
of
her
life
as
the
family
were
all
aware
was
jeremy
but
it
was
an
unfortunate
and
uncomfortable
passion
she
bothered
and
worried
him
she
was
insanely
jealous
she
would
sulk
for
days
did
he
ever
seem
to
prefer
helen
to
herself
no
one
understood
her
she
was
considered
a
difficult
child
quite
unlike
any
other
member
of
the
family
except
possibly
samuel
cole
who
was
an
unsuccessful
painter
and
therefore
as
mary
was
at
present
only
seven
years
of
age
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
family
was
afraid
of
her
aunt
amy
attitude
was
well
after
all
she
sure
to
be
clever
when
she
grows
up
poor
child
and
although
the
parishioners
of
mary
father
always
alluded
to
her
as
the
ludicrous
cole
child
they
told
awed
little
stories
about
the
mental
capacities
and
concluded
comfortably
i
glad
alice
or
jane
or
matilda
or
anabel
is
clever
like
that
they
overwork
when
they
are
young
and
then
when
they
grow
up
meanwhile
mary
led
her
private
life
she
attached
herself
to
no
one
but
jeremy
she
was
delicate
and
suffered
from
perpetual
colds
she
therefore
spent
much
of
her
time
in
the
nursery
reading
her
huge
spectacles
close
to
the
page
her
thin
legs
like
black
sticks
stuck
up
on
the
fender
in
front
of
the
fire
or
curled
up
under
her
on
the
very
different
was
helen
helen
had
a
mass
of
dark
black
hair
big
black
eyes
with
thick
a
thin
white
neck
little
feet
and
already
an
eye
to
effects
in
dress
she
was
charming
to
strangers
to
the
queer
curates
who
haunted
the
family
hall
to
poor
people
and
rich
people
to
old
people
and
young
people
she
was
but
not
impulsive
intelligent
but
not
clever
sympathetic
but
not
sentimental
impatient
but
never
uncontrolled
she
liked
almost
everyone
and
almost
everything
but
no
one
and
nothing
mattered
to
her
very
deeply
she
liked
going
to
church
always
learnt
her
collect
first
on
sunday
and
gave
half
her
to
the
morning
collection
she
was
generous
but
never
extravagant
enjoyed
food
but
was
not
greedy
she
was
quite
aware
that
she
was
pretty
and
might
one
day
be
beautiful
and
she
was
glad
of
that
but
she
was
never
silly
about
her
looks
when
aunt
amy
who
was
always
silly
about
everything
said
in
her
presence
to
visitors
is
helen
the
loveliest
thing
you
ever
saw
she
managed
by
her
shy
to
suggest
that
she
was
pretty
that
aunt
amy
was
a
fool
and
life
was
altogether
very
agreeable
but
that
none
of
these
things
was
of
any
great
importance
she
was
very
good
friends
with
jeremy
but
she
played
no
part
in
his
life
at
all
at
the
same
time
she
often
fought
with
him
simply
from
her
real
deep
consciousness
of
her
superiority
to
him
she
valued
her
authority
and
asserted
it
incessantly
that
authority
had
until
last
year
been
unchallenged
but
jeremy
now
was
growing
she
had
although
she
did
not
as
yet
realise
it
a
difficult
time
before
her
helen
and
mary
advanced
with
their
presents
laid
them
on
the
and
then
retreated
to
watch
the
effect
of
it
all
shall
i
now
asked
jeremy
yes
now
said
helen
and
mary
there
were
three
parcels
one
large
and
shoppy
two
small
and
bound
with
family
paper
tied
by
family
hands
with
family
string
he
grasped
immediately
the
situation
the
shoppy
parcel
was
bought
with
money
and
only
pretended
to
be
from
his
sisters
the
two
small
parcels
were
the
very
handiwork
of
the
ladies
themselves
the
same
having
been
seen
by
all
eyes
at
work
for
the
last
six
months
sometimes
indeed
under
the
cloak
of
attempted
secrecy
but
more
often
because
weariness
or
made
them
careless
in
the
full
light
of
day
his
interest
was
centred
almost
entirely
in
the
shoppy
parcel
which
by
its
shape
might
be
soldiers
but
he
knew
the
rules
of
the
game
and
disregarding
the
large
ostentatious
thing
he
went
magnificently
for
the
two
small
incoherent
bundles
he
opened
them
a
flat
green
with
a
red
pattern
of
roses
a
thick
ring
worked
in
yellow
worsted
these
were
revealed
oh
he
cried
just
what
i
father
always
said
that
on
his
birthday
is
it
said
mary
and
helen
mine
the
ring
said
mary
it
dirty
rather
but
it
would
have
got
dirty
anyway
she
watched
anxiously
to
see
whether
he
preferred
helen
he
watched
them
nervously
lest
he
should
be
expected
to
kiss
them
he
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
hand
instead
and
began
rapidly
to
talk
jampot
will
know
now
which
mine
is
she
always
giving
me
the
wrong
one
i
have
it
always
and
the
green
thing
it
for
the
middle
of
a
table
helen
interrupted
yes
i
know
said
jeremy
hurriedly
i
always
have
it
too
like
mary
when
i
grown
up
and
all
i
say
shall
i
open
the
other
one
now
yes
you
can
said
helen
and
mary
ceasing
to
take
the
central
place
in
the
ceremony
spectators
now
and
eagerly
excited
but
mary
had
a
last
word
you
do
like
mine
do
you
of
course
like
she
wanted
to
say
better
than
helen
but
restrained
herself
i
was
ever
so
long
doing
it
i
thought
i
would
finish
it
in
he
saw
with
terror
that
she
meditated
a
descent
upon
him
a
kiss
was
in
the
air
she
moved
forward
then
to
his
extreme
relief
the
door
opened
and
the
elders
arriving
saved
him
there
were
father
and
mother
uncle
samuel
and
aunt
amy
all
with
presents
faces
of
birthday
tolerance
and
dear
expressions
the
rev
herbert
cole
was
forty
years
of
age
rector
of
james
polchester
during
the
last
ten
years
and
marked
out
for
greater
preferment
in
the
near
future
to
be
a
rector
at
thirty
is
unusual
but
he
had
great
religious
gifts
preached
an
admirable
sermon
and
did
not
believe
in
thinking
about
more
than
he
could
see
he
was
an
excellent
father
in
the
abstract
sense
but
the
parish
absorbed
too
much
of
his
time
to
allow
of
intimacies
with
anyone
cole
was
the
most
placid
lady
in
europe
she
had
a
comfortable
figure
but
was
not
stout
here
a
dimple
and
there
a
dimple
nothing
could
disturb
her
children
servants
her
husband
sermons
district
visiting
her
tuesday
at
homes
the
butcher
the
dean
wife
the
wives
of
the
canons
the
polchester
climate
bills
clothes
other
women
clothes
over
all
these
rocks
of
peril
in
the
sea
of
daily
life
her
barque
happily
floated
some
people
thought
her
stupid
but
in
her
younger
days
she
had
liked
trollope
novels
in
the
cornhill
disapproved
placidly
of
jane
eyre
and
admired
tennyson
so
that
she
could
not
be
considered
unliterary
she
was
economical
loved
her
children
talked
only
the
gentlest
scandal
and
was
a
completely
happy
woman
all
this
in
the
placidest
way
in
the
world
miss
amy
trefusis
her
sister
was
very
different
being
thin
both
in
her
figure
and
her
emotions
she
skirted
tempestuously
over
the
surface
of
things
was
the
most
sentimental
of
human
beings
was
often
in
tears
over
reminiscences
of
books
or
the
weather
was
deeply
religious
in
a
superficial
way
and
really
although
she
would
have
been
entirely
astonished
had
you
told
her
so
cared
for
no
one
in
the
world
but
herself
she
was
dressed
always
in
dark
colours
with
the
high
shoulders
of
the
day
elegant
bonnets
and
little
chains
that
jingled
as
she
moved
in
her
soul
she
feared
and
distrusted
children
but
she
did
not
know
this
she
did
know
however
that
she
feared
and
distrusted
her
brother
samuel
her
brother
samuel
was
all
that
the
trefusis
family
as
a
conservative
body
who
believed
in
tradition
had
least
reason
for
understanding
he
had
been
a
failure
from
the
first
moment
of
his
entry
into
the
grammar
school
in
polchester
years
before
this
story
he
had
continued
a
failure
at
winchester
and
at
christ
church
oxford
he
had
desired
to
be
a
painter
he
had
broken
from
the
family
and
gone
to
study
art
in
paris
he
had
starved
and
starved
was
at
death
door
was
dragged
home
and
there
suddenly
had
relapsed
into
polchester
lived
first
on
his
father
then
on
his
painted
about
the
town
painted
made
cynical
remarks
about
the
polcastrians
painted
made
blasphemous
remarks
about
the
bishop
the
dean
and
all
the
canons
painted
and
refused
to
leave
his
house
he
was
a
scandal
of
course
he
was
fat
untidy
wore
a
blue
when
he
was
out
and
sometimes
went
down
orange
street
in
carpet
slippers
he
was
a
scandal
but
what
are
you
to
do
if
a
relative
is
obstinate
and
refuses
to
go
at
least
make
him
shave
say
the
wives
of
the
canons
but
no
one
had
ever
made
samuel
trefusis
do
anything
that
he
did
not
want
to
do
he
was
sometimes
not
shaved
for
three
whole
days
and
nights
at
any
rate
there
he
is
it
is
of
no
use
saying
that
he
does
not
exist
as
many
of
the
close
ladies
try
to
do
and
at
least
he
does
not
paint
strange
women
he
prefers
flowers
and
cows
and
the
polchester
woods
although
anything
less
like
cows
flowers
and
woods
sampson
wife
of
the
dean
who
once
had
a
in
the
academy
says
she
has
never
seen
samuel
trefusis
is
a
failure
and
what
is
truly
awful
he
does
not
mind
nobody
buys
his
pictures
and
he
does
not
care
and
worst
taste
of
all
he
laughs
at
his
relations
although
he
lives
on
them
nothing
further
need
be
said
to
helen
mary
and
jeremy
he
had
always
been
a
fascinating
object
although
they
realised
with
that
sharp
worldly
wisdom
to
be
found
in
all
infants
of
tender
years
that
he
was
a
failure
a
dirty
man
and
disliked
children
he
very
rarely
spoke
to
them
was
once
quite
wildly
enraged
when
mary
was
discovered
licking
his
paints
it
was
the
paints
he
seemed
anxious
about
not
in
the
least
the
poor
little
health
as
his
sister
amy
said
and
had
publicly
been
heard
to
say
that
his
had
only
got
the
children
he
deserved
nevertheless
jeremy
had
always
been
interested
in
him
he
liked
his
fat
round
shape
his
rough
untidy
grey
hair
his
scarlet
slippers
his
blue
the
smudges
of
paint
sometimes
to
be
discovered
on
his
cheeks
and
the
jingling
noises
he
made
in
his
pocket
with
his
money
he
was
certainly
more
fun
than
aunt
amy
there
then
they
all
were
with
their
presents
and
their
birthday
faces
shall
i
undo
them
for
you
darling
of
course
said
aunt
amy
jeremy
shook
his
head
he
did
not
say
what
he
thought
of
her
and
continued
to
tug
at
the
string
he
was
given
a
large
pair
of
scissors
he
received
from
father
a
silver
watch
from
mother
a
a
dark
blue
and
gold
prayer
book
with
a
thick
squashy
leather
cover
from
aunt
amy
he
was
in
an
ecstasy
how
he
had
longed
for
a
watch
just
such
a
one
and
a
what
colours
he
could
make
even
aunt
amy
prayer
book
was
something
with
its
squashy
cover
and
silk
marker
only
why
did
aunt
amy
never
give
him
anything
sensible
he
stood
there
his
face
flushed
his
eyes
sparkling
the
watch
in
one
hand
and
the
in
the
other
remarks
were
heard
like
you
poke
it
with
your
finger
jerry
darling
or
you
break
the
hands
off
and
i
thought
he
better
have
the
square
sort
and
not
the
tubes
they
so
squashy
and
you
be
able
to
learn
your
collect
so
easily
with
that
big
print
jerry
dear
very
kind
of
you
meanwhile
he
was
aware
that
uncle
samuel
had
given
him
nothing
there
was
a
little
thick
catch
of
disappointment
in
his
throat
not
because
he
wanted
a
present
but
because
he
liked
uncle
samuel
suddenly
from
somewhere
behind
him
his
uncle
said
shut
your
eyes
jerry
do
open
them
until
i
tell
you
then
rather
crossly
no
amy
leave
me
alone
i
know
what
i
about
thank
jeremy
shut
his
eyes
tight
he
closed
them
so
that
the
eyelids
seemed
to
turn
right
inwards
and
red
lights
flashed
he
stood
there
for
at
least
a
century
all
in
darkness
no
one
saying
anything
save
that
once
mary
cried
oh
and
clapped
her
hands
which
same
cry
excited
him
to
such
a
pitch
that
he
would
have
dug
his
nails
into
his
hands
had
he
not
so
consistently
in
the
past
bitten
them
that
there
were
no
nails
with
which
to
dig
he
waited
he
waited
he
waited
he
was
not
eight
he
was
eighty
when
at
last
uncle
samuel
said
now
you
may
he
opened
his
eyes
and
turned
for
a
moment
the
nursery
too
rocked
in
the
unfamiliar
light
then
he
saw
on
the
middle
of
the
nursery
carpet
was
a
village
a
real
village
six
houses
with
red
roofs
green
windows
and
white
porches
a
church
with
a
tower
and
a
tiny
bell
an
orchard
with
flowers
on
the
fruit
trees
a
green
lawn
a
street
with
a
shop
a
post
office
and
a
grocer
villager
noah
noah
and
the
little
noahs
a
field
with
cows
horses
dogs
a
farm
with
chickens
and
even
two
pigs
he
stood
he
stared
he
drew
a
deep
breath
it
comes
all
the
way
from
germany
said
aunt
amy
who
always
made
things
uninteresting
if
she
possibly
could
there
was
much
delighted
talk
jeremy
said
nothing
but
uncle
samuel
understood
glad
you
like
it
he
said
and
left
the
room
are
you
pleased
said
helen
jeremy
still
said
nothing
sausages
sausages
cried
mary
as
gladys
grinning
entered
with
a
dish
of
a
lovely
and
pleasant
smell
but
jeremy
did
not
turn
he
simply
stood
there
staring
iii
it
is
of
the
essence
of
birthdays
that
they
can
not
maintain
throughout
a
long
day
the
glorious
character
of
their
early
dawning
in
polchester
thirty
years
ago
there
were
no
cinematographs
no
theatre
save
for
an
occasional
amateur
performance
at
the
assembly
rooms
and
once
and
again
a
show
on
this
particular
day
moreover
and
cole
were
immensely
busied
with
preparations
for
some
parochial
tea
miss
trefusis
had
calls
to
make
and
of
course
uncle
samuel
was
invisible
the
birthday
then
suddenly
became
no
longer
a
birthday
but
an
ordinary
day
with
an
extraordinary
standard
this
is
why
so
many
birthdays
end
in
tears
but
jeremy
as
was
usual
with
him
took
everything
quietly
he
might
cry
aloud
about
such
an
affair
as
the
conquest
of
the
wicker
chair
because
that
did
not
deeply
matter
to
him
but
about
the
real
things
he
was
silent
the
village
was
one
of
the
real
things
during
all
the
morning
he
remained
shut
up
in
his
soul
with
it
the
wide
world
closed
off
from
them
by
many
muffled
doors
how
had
uncle
samuel
known
that
he
had
deep
in
his
own
inside
so
deep
that
he
had
not
mentioned
it
even
to
himself
wanted
something
just
like
this
thirty
years
ago
there
were
none
of
the
presents
that
there
are
for
children
now
no
wonderful
railways
that
run
round
the
nursery
from
monte
carlo
to
paris
with
all
the
stations
marked
no
dolls
that
are
so
like
fashionable
women
that
you
are
given
a
manicure
set
with
them
to
keep
their
nails
tidy
no
miniature
that
run
of
themselves
and
go
for
miles
round
the
floor
without
being
wound
up
jeremy
knew
none
of
these
things
and
was
the
happier
that
he
did
not
to
such
a
boy
such
a
village
was
a
miracle
it
had
not
come
from
germany
as
aunt
amy
said
but
from
heaven
but
it
was
even
more
of
uncle
samuel
than
the
village
that
he
was
thinking
when
they
started
helen
mary
and
he
in
charge
of
the
jampot
upon
their
afternoon
walk
he
was
still
asking
himself
the
same
questions
how
had
uncle
samuel
known
so
exactly
had
it
been
a
great
trouble
to
bring
from
so
far
away
had
uncle
samuel
thought
it
bad
of
him
not
to
thank
him
he
was
lost
in
such
considerations
when
the
jampot
inquired
of
him
the
way
that
their
walk
should
take
it
was
his
choice
because
it
was
his
birthday
he
had
no
choice
there
was
one
walk
that
far
exceeded
all
others
in
glory
straight
down
orange
street
straight
again
through
the
market
past
the
assembly
rooms
and
the
town
hall
past
the
flower
and
fruit
stalls
and
the
old
banana
woman
under
the
green
umbrella
and
the
toy
stall
with
coloured
balloons
the
china
dogs
and
the
nodding
donkeys
up
the
high
street
into
the
of
the
close
whence
one
could
look
down
between
the
houses
on
to
the
orchards
round
the
cathedral
with
the
meadows
pol
meads
sloping
down
to
the
river
so
through
orchard
lane
into
orange
street
once
again
such
a
walk
combined
every
magic
and
delight
known
to
the
heart
of
man
but
it
was
not
generally
allowed
because
jeremy
would
drag
past
the
shops
the
stalls
in
the
market
place
and
the
walk
behind
the
cathedral
whence
one
might
sometimes
see
boats
on
the
river
sheep
and
cows
in
the
meads
and
in
their
proper
season
delight
of
delights
lambs
they
set
out
thirty
years
ago
the
winter
weather
in
polchester
was
wonderful
now
of
course
there
are
no
hard
winters
no
frost
no
snow
no
waits
no
snowmen
and
no
skating
on
the
pol
then
there
were
all
those
things
was
of
a
hard
glittering
frost
the
sun
like
a
round
red
lacquer
tray
fell
heavily
slowly
through
a
faint
pale
sky
that
was
not
strong
enough
to
sustain
it
the
air
had
the
cold
sweet
twang
of
peppermints
in
the
throat
polchester
was
a
painted
town
upon
a
blue
screen
the
cathedral
towers
purple
against
the
sky
the
air
was
scented
with
burning
leaves
and
cries
from
the
town
rose
up
clear
and
hard
lingering
and
falling
like
notes
of
music
somewhere
they
were
playing
football
and
the
shouting
was
distant
and
regular
like
the
tramp
of
armed
men
three
struck
the
cathedral
clock
as
though
it
were
calling
open
other
lesser
clocks
repeated
the
challenge
cry
through
the
town
woppley
woppley
why
sung
the
man
who
was
selling
skins
down
orange
street
the
sky
turning
slowly
from
blue
to
gold
shone
mysteriously
through
the
glass
of
the
street
lamps
and
the
sun
began
to
wrap
itself
in
tints
of
purple
and
crocus
and
iris
woppley
woppley
why
screamed
the
suddenly
appearing
at
the
top
of
the
street
now
master
jeremy
said
the
jampot
or
we
shall
never
get
this
night
and
i
might
have
known
you
choose
the
longest
walk
possible
come
along
miss
mary
now
none
of
that
jeremy
in
his
adventure
cap
and
rough
blue
navy
coat
felt
himself
superior
to
the
jampot
so
he
only
said
oh
do
bother
nurse
and
then
in
the
same
breath
i
run
you
down
the
hill
mary
and
before
anyone
could
say
a
word
there
they
were
at
the
bottom
of
orange
street
as
though
they
had
fallen
into
a
well
the
sun
was
gone
the
golden
horizon
was
gone
only
the
purple
lights
began
to
gather
about
their
feet
and
climb
slowly
the
high
black
houses
mary
liked
this
because
she
now
had
jeremy
to
herself
she
began
hurriedly
so
that
she
should
lose
no
time
shall
i
tell
you
a
story
jeremy
i
got
a
new
one
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
boys
and
they
lived
in
a
wood
and
an
old
witch
ate
them
and
the
princess
who
had
heaps
of
jewellery
and
a
white
horse
and
a
lovely
gold
dress
came
and
it
was
snowing
and
the
witch
this
was
always
mary
way
she
loved
to
tell
jeremy
interesting
stories
and
he
did
not
mind
because
he
did
not
listen
and
could
meanwhile
think
his
own
thoughts
his
chief
decision
arrived
at
as
he
marched
along
was
that
he
would
keep
the
village
to
himself
no
one
else
should
put
their
fingers
into
it
arrange
the
orchard
with
the
coloured
trees
decide
upon
the
names
of
the
noah
family
settle
the
village
street
in
its
final
order
ring
the
bell
of
the
church
or
milk
the
cows
he
alone
would
do
all
these
things
and
so
considering
he
seemed
to
himself
very
like
god
god
he
supposed
could
pull
polchester
about
root
out
a
house
here
another
there
knock
the
assembly
rooms
down
and
send
a
thunderbolt
on
to
the
apple
woman
umbrella
well
then
so
could
he
with
his
village
he
walked
swollen
with
pride
he
arrived
at
the
first
island
of
circe
namely
the
window
of
thompson
the
jeweller
in
market
street
pressed
his
nose
to
the
pane
and
refused
to
listen
when
the
jampot
suggested
that
he
should
move
forward
he
could
see
the
diamonds
like
drops
of
water
in
the
sun
and
the
pearls
like
drops
of
milk
and
the
rubies
like
drops
of
blood
but
it
was
not
of
diamonds
pearls
or
rubies
that
he
was
thinking
he
thought
only
of
his
village
he
would
ring
the
church
bell
and
then
all
the
noah
family
should
start
out
of
the
door
down
the
garden
up
the
village
street
it
did
not
matter
if
one
of
the
younger
noahs
should
be
lazy
and
wish
to
stay
at
home
beneath
the
flowering
trees
of
the
orchard
she
would
not
be
allowed
he
was
as
he
was
as
god
the
butcher
should
go
if
he
was
not
stuck
to
his
shop
and
even
some
of
his
cows
might
go
he
was
as
god
he
heard
mary
voice
in
his
ear
and
after
that
they
all
ate
chocolates
with
white
cream
and
red
cream
and
they
sucked
it
off
pins
and
there
were
hard
bits
and
soft
bits
and
the
princess
she
was
a
frog
now
you
remember
do
you
jeremy
the
witch
turned
her
hotted
the
oven
like
cook
has
with
black
doors
and
hotted
it
and
hotted
it
but
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
and
on
the
other
side
the
jampot
voice
you
naughty
boy
for
everyone
to
see
just
because
it
your
birthday
which
i
wish
there
was
no
birthdays
nor
there
would
be
if
i
had
my
jeremy
turned
from
thompson
window
a
scornful
smile
on
his
face
i
you
nurse
he
said
if
i
said
out
loud
wo
go
i
would
go
and
no
one
could
make
well
come
along
then
said
nurse
do
be
so
stupid
jerry
said
helen
calmly
if
a
policeman
came
and
said
you
had
to
go
home
you
have
to
no
i
would
said
jeremy
then
they
put
you
in
they
they
hang
you
they
could
replied
jeremy
farther
than
this
argument
can
not
go
so
helen
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
you
are
and
they
all
moved
forward
he
found
then
that
this
new
sense
or
power
detracted
a
little
from
the
excitements
of
the
market
place
although
the
was
dazzling
with
flowers
there
was
a
new
kind
of
pig
that
lifted
its
tail
and
lowered
it
again
on
the
toy
stall
and
the
was
as
fat
as
ever
and
had
thick
clumps
of
yellow
bananas
hanging
most
richly
around
her
head
they
ascended
the
high
street
and
reached
the
close
it
was
three
and
the
cathedral
bells
had
begun
to
ring
for
evensong
all
the
houses
in
the
close
were
painted
with
a
pale
yellow
light
across
the
long
green
cathedral
lawn
thin
black
shadows
like
the
fingers
of
giants
pointed
to
the
cathedral
door
all
was
so
silent
here
that
the
bells
danced
against
the
houses
and
back
again
the
echoes
lingering
in
the
high
elms
and
mingling
with
the
placid
cooing
of
the
rooks
there
sampson
said
jeremy
aunt
amy
says
she
a
wicked
woman
do
you
think
she
a
wicked
woman
nurse
he
gazed
at
the
stout
figure
with
interest
if
he
were
truly
god
he
would
turn
her
into
a
rabbit
this
thought
amused
him
and
he
began
to
laugh
you
naughty
boy
now
come
along
do
said
the
jampot
who
distrusted
laughter
in
jerry
i
ring
the
bells
when
i
grow
up
he
said
and
i
ring
them
in
the
middle
of
the
night
so
that
everyone
will
have
to
go
to
church
when
they
do
want
to
i
be
able
to
do
what
i
like
when
i
grow
no
you
wo
said
helen
father
and
mother
ca
do
what
they
yes
they
can
said
jeremy
no
they
ca
answered
helen
or
they
so
they
do
said
jeremy
silly
yourself
said
helen
very
calmly
because
she
knew
very
well
that
she
was
not
silly
now
children
stop
it
do
said
the
jampot
jeremy
sense
of
newly
received
power
reached
its
climax
when
they
walked
round
the
close
and
reached
the
back
of
the
cathedral
i
know
that
now
both
for
jeremy
and
me
that
prospect
has
dwindled
into
its
proper
proportions
but
how
can
a
man
be
he
come
to
threescore
and
ten
and
more
ever
forget
the
size
the
splendour
the
stupendous
extravagance
of
that
early
vision
jeremy
saw
that
day
the
old
fragment
of
castle
wall
the
green
expanse
falling
like
a
sheeted
waterfall
from
the
cathedral
heights
the
blue
line
of
river
flashing
in
the
evening
sun
between
the
trees
the
long
spaces
of
black
shadow
spreading
slowly
over
the
colour
as
though
it
were
all
being
rolled
up
and
laid
away
for
another
day
the
brown
frosty
path
of
the
rope
walk
the
farther
bank
climbing
into
fields
and
hedges
ending
in
the
ridge
of
wood
black
against
the
golden
sky
and
all
so
still
as
the
children
stood
there
they
could
catch
nestlings
faint
cries
stirrings
of
dead
leaves
and
twigs
as
birds
and
beasts
moved
to
their
homes
the
cooing
of
the
rooks
about
the
black
branches
seemed
to
promise
that
this
world
should
be
for
ever
tranquil
for
ever
cloistered
and
removed
the
sun
red
and
flaming
above
the
dark
wood
flung
white
mists
hither
and
thither
to
veil
its
departure
the
silence
deepened
the
last
light
flamed
on
the
river
and
died
upon
the
hill
now
children
come
along
do
said
the
jampot
who
had
been
held
in
spite
of
herself
and
would
pay
for
it
she
knew
in
rheumatism
it
was
then
that
jeremy
sense
of
power
born
from
that
moment
early
in
the
day
when
he
had
sat
in
the
wicker
chair
reached
its
climax
he
stood
there
his
legs
apart
looking
upon
the
darkening
world
and
felt
that
he
could
do
anything
anything
at
any
rate
there
was
one
thing
that
he
could
do
disobey
the
jampot
i
not
coming
he
said
till
i
you
wicked
boy
she
cried
her
temper
rising
with
the
evening
chills
her
desire
for
a
cup
of
hot
tea
and
an
aching
longing
for
a
comfortable
chair
when
everyone
been
so
good
to
you
and
the
things
been
given
and
all
why
it
a
wicked
the
jampot
who
was
a
woman
happily
without
imagination
saw
a
naughty
small
boy
spoiled
and
needing
the
slipper
a
rook
taking
a
last
look
at
the
world
before
retiring
to
rest
watching
from
his
leafless
bough
saw
a
mortal
spirit
defying
the
universe
and
sympathised
with
it
i
shall
tell
your
mother
said
the
jampot
now
come
master
jeremy
be
a
good
oh
do
bother
nurse
he
answered
impatiently
you
such
a
she
realised
in
that
moment
that
he
was
suddenly
beyond
her
power
that
he
would
never
be
within
it
again
she
had
nursed
him
for
eight
years
she
had
loved
him
in
her
own
way
she
dull
perhaps
in
the
ways
of
the
world
but
wise
in
the
ways
of
nurses
ways
that
are
built
up
of
surrender
and
surrender
gave
him
then
and
there
to
the
larger
life
you
may
behave
as
you
like
master
jeremy
she
said
it
wo
be
for
long
that
i
have
the
dealing
with
you
praise
be
you
be
going
to
school
next
september
and
then
we
see
what
happen
to
your
wicked
school
he
turned
upon
her
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
school
he
stared
at
them
all
the
world
tumbled
from
him
in
his
soul
was
a
confusion
of
triumph
and
dismay
of
excitement
and
loneliness
of
the
sudden
falling
from
him
of
all
old
standards
old
horizons
of
pride
and
humility
how
little
now
was
the
village
to
him
he
looked
at
them
to
see
whether
they
could
understand
they
could
not
very
quietly
he
followed
them
home
his
birthday
had
achieved
its
climax
chapter
ii
the
family
dog
i
that
winter
of
jeremy
eighth
birthday
was
famous
for
its
snow
glebeshire
has
never
yielded
to
the
wishes
of
its
children
in
the
matter
of
snowy
christmases
and
polchester
has
the
reputation
of
muggy
warmth
and
foggy
mists
but
here
was
a
year
when
traditions
were
fulfilled
in
the
most
reckless
manner
and
all
the
babies
were
treated
to
a
present
of
snow
on
so
fine
a
scale
that
certainly
for
the
rest
of
their
days
they
will
go
about
saying
ah
you
should
see
the
winters
we
used
to
have
when
we
were
children
the
snow
began
on
the
very
day
after
jeremy
birthday
coming
down
doubtfully
slowly
little
grey
flakes
against
a
grey
sky
then
sparkling
white
then
vanishing
flashes
of
moisture
on
a
wet
unsympathetic
soil
that
day
the
snow
did
not
lie
and
for
a
week
it
did
not
come
again
then
with
a
whirl
it
seized
the
land
and
for
two
days
and
nights
did
not
loosen
its
grip
from
the
nursery
windows
the
children
watched
it
their
noses
making
little
rings
on
the
their
delighted
eyes
snatching
fascinating
glimpses
of
figures
tossed
through
the
storm
cabs
beating
their
way
the
man
the
milkman
the
postman
brave
adventurers
all
fighting
as
it
seemed
for
their
very
lives
for
two
days
the
children
did
not
leave
the
house
and
the
natural
result
of
that
was
that
on
the
second
afternoon
tempers
were
like
so
many
dogs
straining
tugging
pulling
at
their
chains
it
could
not
be
denied
that
jeremy
had
been
tiresome
to
everyone
since
the
afternoon
when
he
had
heard
the
news
of
his
going
to
school
next
september
it
had
seemed
to
him
a
tremendous
event
the
beginning
of
the
end
to
the
others
who
lived
in
the
immediate
present
it
was
a
crisis
so
remote
as
scarcely
to
count
at
all
mary
would
have
liked
to
be
sentimental
about
it
but
from
this
she
was
sternly
prevented
there
was
then
nothing
more
to
be
said
jeremy
was
suddenly
isolated
from
them
all
his
destiny
was
peculiar
they
were
girls
he
was
a
boy
they
understood
neither
his
fears
nor
his
ambitions
he
needed
terribly
a
companion
the
snow
shutting
them
in
laughed
at
their
struggles
against
monotony
the
nursery
clock
struck
three
and
they
realised
that
two
whole
hours
must
pass
before
the
next
meal
mary
her
nose
red
from
pressing
on
the
her
eyes
gazing
through
her
huge
spectacles
wistfully
at
jeremy
longed
to
suggest
that
she
should
read
aloud
to
him
she
knew
that
he
hated
it
she
pretended
to
herself
that
she
did
not
know
jeremy
stared
desperately
at
helen
who
was
sitting
dignified
and
collected
in
the
wicker
chair
hemming
a
minute
handkerchief
we
might
play
pirates
jeremy
said
with
a
little
cough
the
better
to
secure
her
attention
there
was
no
answer
or
there
the
hut
in
the
wood
if
anyone
likes
it
better
he
added
politely
he
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
had
the
jampot
not
told
him
about
school
he
would
at
this
very
moment
be
playing
most
happily
with
his
village
it
spread
out
there
before
him
on
the
nursery
floor
the
noah
family
engaged
upon
tea
in
the
orchard
the
butcher
staring
with
fixed
gaze
from
the
door
of
his
shop
three
cows
and
a
sheep
absorbed
in
the
architecture
of
the
church
he
sighed
then
said
again
perhaps
pirates
would
be
still
helen
did
not
reply
he
abandoned
the
attempted
control
of
his
passions
it
very
rude
he
said
not
to
answer
when
gentlemen
speak
to
i
do
see
any
gentlemen
answered
helen
quietly
without
raising
her
eyes
which
was
as
she
knew
a
provoking
habit
yes
you
do
almost
screamed
jeremy
i
you
not
continued
helen
you
only
eight
gentlemen
must
be
over
twenty
like
father
or
i
hate
jellybrand
and
i
hate
you
replied
jeremy
i
do
care
said
helen
yes
you
do
said
jeremy
then
suddenly
as
though
even
a
good
quarrel
were
not
worth
while
on
this
heavily
burdened
afternoon
he
said
gently
you
might
play
pirates
helen
you
can
be
sir
i
got
this
to
it
a
dirty
old
thing
continued
jeremy
pursuing
an
argument
and
it
be
dirtier
soon
and
the
jampot
says
you
do
all
the
stitches
wrong
i
wish
i
was
at
i
wish
you
were
said
helen
there
was
a
pause
after
this
jeremy
went
sadly
back
to
his
mary
felt
that
her
moment
had
arrived
sniffing
as
was
her
habit
when
she
wanted
something
very
badly
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
little
more
than
a
whisper
it
would
be
fun
would
it
perhaps
if
i
read
something
jeremy
jeremy
was
a
gentleman
although
he
was
only
eight
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
behind
the
spectacles
eyes
beseeching
his
permission
well
it
would
be
much
fun
he
said
but
it
all
beastly
this
afternoon
can
i
sit
on
the
window
too
asked
mary
not
too
close
because
it
tickles
my
ear
but
you
can
if
you
she
hurried
across
to
the
bookshelf
there
and
and
tatters
and
the
fearless
and
baby
and
and
is
best
said
jeremy
sighing
you
know
it
better
than
the
he
curled
himself
into
a
corner
of
the
from
his
position
there
he
had
a
fine
view
immediately
below
him
was
the
garden
white
and
grey
under
the
grey
sky
the
broken
fountain
standing
up
like
a
snow
man
in
the
middle
of
it
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
and
a
great
stillness
held
the
world
beyond
the
little
iron
gate
of
the
garden
that
always
sneezed
tishoo
when
you
closed
it
was
the
top
of
orange
street
then
down
the
hill
on
the
right
was
the
tower
of
his
father
church
exactly
opposite
the
gate
was
the
road
that
led
to
the
orchards
and
on
the
right
of
that
was
the
polchester
high
school
for
young
ladies
held
in
great
contempt
by
jeremy
the
more
that
helen
would
shortly
be
a
there
would
scream
with
the
other
girls
and
worst
of
all
would
soon
be
seen
walking
with
her
arm
round
another
girl
neck
chattering
and
eating
sweets
the
whole
world
seemed
deserted
no
colour
no
movement
no
sound
he
sighed
once
more
i
like
to
eat
jam
and
jam
lots
of
it
he
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
be
mary
arrived
and
swung
herself
up
on
to
the
it
the
glass
one
i
hope
you
do
mind
she
said
apprehensively
oh
it
all
right
he
allowed
he
flung
a
glance
back
to
the
lighted
nursery
it
seemed
by
contrast
with
that
grey
world
outside
to
blaze
with
colour
the
ships
on
the
wallpaper
the
bright
lights
and
shadows
of
the
charge
of
the
light
brigade
the
salmon
fronts
of
the
doll
house
the
green
and
red
of
the
village
on
the
floor
with
the
flowery
trees
the
blue
tablecloth
the
shining
brass
all
alive
and
sparkling
in
the
flames
and
shadows
of
the
fire
caught
and
held
by
the
fine
gold
of
the
higher
fender
beyond
that
dead
white
soon
it
would
be
dark
the
curtains
would
be
drawn
and
still
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
he
sighed
again
it
a
nice
bit
about
the
shop
said
mary
jeremy
said
nothing
so
she
began
she
started
at
a
run
she
looked
at
the
queen
who
seemed
to
have
sniff
sniff
suddenly
wrapped
wrapped
asked
jeremy
i
do
know
said
mary
rubbing
her
nose
what
it
means
but
perhaps
we
see
presently
herself
up
in
wool
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
again
she
could
again
she
could
asked
jeremy
it
should
be
could
look
again
oh
there
a
stop
said
mary
i
did
see
after
there
a
stop
could
make
out
what
had
happened
at
all
i
ca
either
said
jeremy
crossly
it
would
be
better
perhaps
if
i
read
it
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
minute
said
mary
confidently
she
in
a
shop
and
was
that
really
was
it
really
a
ship
that
was
sitting
on
the
counter
she
finished
with
a
run
a
what
asked
jeremy
a
ship
a
ship
how
could
it
sit
on
a
counter
he
asked
oh
no
it
a
sheep
how
silly
i
am
mary
exclaimed
you
do
read
badly
he
agreed
frankly
i
never
can
understand
and
it
was
at
that
very
moment
that
he
saw
the
dog
ii
he
had
been
staring
down
into
the
garden
with
a
gaze
half
abstracted
half
speculative
listening
with
one
ear
to
mary
with
the
other
to
the
stir
of
the
fire
the
heavy
beat
of
the
clock
and
the
rustlings
of
martha
the
canary
he
watched
the
snowy
expanse
of
garden
the
black
gate
the
road
beyond
a
vast
wave
of
pale
grey
light
the
herald
of
approaching
dusk
swept
the
horizon
the
snowy
roofs
the
streets
and
jeremy
felt
some
contact
with
the
strange
air
the
mysterious
omens
that
the
first
snows
of
the
winter
spread
about
the
land
he
watched
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
something
to
happen
the
creature
came
up
very
slowly
over
the
crest
of
orange
street
no
one
else
was
in
sight
no
cart
no
horse
no
wayfarer
at
first
the
dog
was
only
a
little
black
smudge
against
the
snow
then
as
he
arrived
at
the
coles
jeremy
could
see
him
very
distinctly
he
was
it
appeared
quite
alone
he
had
been
it
was
evident
badly
beaten
by
the
storm
intended
by
nature
to
be
a
rough
and
hairy
dog
he
now
appeared
before
god
and
men
a
shivering
battered
creature
dripping
and
bedraggled
and
bewildered
and
yet
even
in
that
first
distant
glimpse
jeremy
discerned
a
fine
independence
he
was
a
short
stumpy
dog
in
no
way
designed
for
dignified
attitudes
and
patronising
superiority
nevertheless
as
he
now
wandered
slowly
up
the
street
his
nose
was
in
the
air
and
he
said
to
the
whole
world
the
storm
may
have
done
its
best
to
defeat
me
it
has
failed
i
am
as
i
was
i
ask
charity
of
no
man
i
know
what
is
due
to
it
was
this
that
attracted
jeremy
he
had
himself
felt
thus
after
a
slippering
from
his
father
or
idiotic
punishments
from
the
jampot
and
the
uninvited
consolations
of
mary
or
helen
upon
such
occasions
had
been
resented
with
so
fierce
a
bitterness
that
his
reputation
for
sulkiness
had
been
soundly
established
with
all
his
circle
mary
was
reading
old
sheep
sitting
in
an
knitting
and
every
now
and
then
leaving
off
to
look
at
her
through
a
great
pair
of
spectacles
he
touched
her
arm
and
whispered
i
say
mary
stop
a
minute
look
at
that
dog
down
they
both
stared
down
into
the
garden
the
dog
had
stopped
at
the
gate
it
sniffed
at
the
bars
sniffed
at
the
wall
beyond
then
very
slowly
but
with
real
dignity
continued
its
way
up
the
road
poor
thing
said
jeremy
it
is
in
a
then
to
their
astonishment
the
dog
turned
back
and
sauntering
down
the
road
again
as
though
it
had
nothing
all
day
to
do
but
to
wander
about
and
as
though
it
were
not
wet
shivering
and
hungry
it
once
more
smelt
the
gate
oh
said
mary
and
jeremy
together
it
like
mother
said
jeremy
when
she
going
to
see
someone
and
is
sure
whether
it
the
right
then
most
marvellous
of
unexpected
climaxes
the
dog
suddenly
began
to
squeeze
itself
between
the
bottom
bar
of
the
gate
and
the
ground
the
interval
was
fortunately
a
large
one
a
moment
later
the
animal
was
in
the
coles
garden
the
motives
that
led
jeremy
to
behave
as
he
did
are
uncertain
it
may
have
been
something
to
do
with
the
general
boredom
of
the
afternoon
it
may
have
been
that
he
felt
pity
for
the
bedraggled
aspect
of
the
animal
most
probable
reason
of
all
was
that
independence
flung
up
from
the
road
as
it
were
expressly
at
himself
the
dog
obviously
did
not
feel
any
great
respect
for
the
cole
household
he
wandered
about
the
garden
sniffing
and
smelling
exactly
as
though
the
whole
place
belonged
to
him
and
a
ridiculous
stump
of
tail
unsubdued
by
the
weather
gave
him
the
ludicrous
dignity
of
a
malvolio
i
going
down
whispered
jeremy
flinging
a
cautious
glance
at
helen
who
was
absorbed
in
her
sewing
mary
eyes
grew
wide
with
horror
and
admiration
you
not
going
out
she
whispered
in
the
snow
oh
jeremy
they
will
be
i
do
care
whispered
jeremy
back
again
they
can
indeed
before
mary
frightened
whisper
he
had
not
intended
to
do
more
than
creep
down
into
the
pantry
and
watch
the
dog
at
close
range
now
it
was
as
though
mary
had
challenged
him
he
knew
that
it
was
the
most
wicked
thing
that
he
could
do
to
go
out
into
the
snow
without
a
coat
and
in
his
slippers
he
might
even
according
to
aunt
amy
die
of
it
but
as
death
at
present
meant
no
more
to
him
than
a
position
of
importance
and
a
quantity
of
jelly
and
chicken
that
prospect
did
not
deter
him
he
left
the
room
so
quietly
that
helen
did
not
even
lift
her
eyes
then
upon
the
landing
he
waited
and
listened
the
house
had
all
the
lighted
trembling
dusk
of
the
snowy
afternoon
there
was
no
sound
save
the
ticking
of
the
clocks
he
might
come
upon
the
jampot
at
any
moment
but
this
was
just
the
hour
when
she
liked
to
drink
her
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
he
knew
from
deep
and
constant
study
every
movement
of
her
day
fortune
favoured
him
he
reached
without
trouble
the
little
dark
corkscrew
servants
staircase
down
this
he
crept
and
found
himself
beside
the
little
gardener
door
although
here
there
was
only
dusk
he
felt
for
the
handle
of
the
lock
found
it
turned
it
and
was
at
once
over
the
steps
into
the
garden
here
with
a
vengeance
he
felt
the
full
romance
and
danger
of
his
enterprise
it
was
horribly
cold
he
had
been
in
the
nursery
for
two
whole
days
wrapped
up
and
warm
and
now
the
snowy
world
seemed
to
leap
up
at
him
and
drag
him
down
as
though
into
an
icy
well
mysterious
shadows
hovered
over
the
garden
the
fountain
pointed
darkly
against
the
sky
and
he
could
feel
from
the
feathery
touches
upon
his
face
that
the
snow
had
begun
to
fall
again
he
moved
forward
a
few
steps
the
house
was
so
dark
behind
him
the
world
so
dim
and
uncertain
in
front
of
him
that
for
a
moment
his
heart
failed
him
he
might
have
to
search
the
whole
garden
for
the
dog
then
he
heard
a
sniff
felt
something
wet
against
his
leg
he
had
almost
stepped
upon
the
animal
he
bent
down
and
stroked
its
wet
coat
the
dog
stood
quite
still
then
moved
forward
towards
the
house
sniffed
at
the
steps
at
last
walked
calmly
through
the
open
door
as
though
the
house
belonged
to
him
jeremy
followed
closed
the
door
behind
him
then
there
they
were
in
the
little
dark
passage
with
the
boy
heart
beating
like
a
drum
his
teeth
chattering
and
a
terrible
temptation
to
sneeze
hovering
around
him
let
him
reach
the
nursery
and
establish
the
animal
there
and
all
might
be
well
but
let
them
be
discovered
cold
and
shivering
in
the
passage
and
out
the
dog
would
be
flung
he
knew
so
exactly
what
would
happen
he
could
hear
the
voices
in
the
kitchen
he
knew
that
they
were
sitting
warm
there
by
the
fire
but
that
at
any
moment
jampot
might
think
good
to
climb
the
stairs
and
see
what
mischief
they
children
were
up
everything
depended
upon
the
dog
did
he
bark
or
whine
out
into
the
night
he
must
go
again
probably
to
die
in
the
cold
but
jeremy
the
least
sentimental
of
that
most
sentimental
race
the
english
was
too
intent
upon
his
threatened
sneeze
to
pay
much
attention
to
these
awful
possibilities
he
took
off
his
slippers
and
began
to
climb
the
stairs
the
dog
close
behind
him
very
grave
and
dignified
in
spite
of
the
little
trail
of
snow
and
water
that
he
left
in
his
track
the
nursery
door
was
reached
pushed
softly
open
and
the
startled
gaze
of
mary
and
helen
fell
upon
the
adventurer
and
his
prize
iii
the
dog
went
directly
to
the
fire
there
sitting
in
the
very
middle
of
the
golden
cockatoos
on
the
turkey
rug
he
began
to
lick
himself
he
did
this
by
sitting
very
square
on
three
legs
and
spreading
out
the
fourth
stiff
and
erect
as
though
it
had
been
not
a
leg
at
all
but
something
of
wood
or
iron
the
melted
snow
poured
off
him
making
a
fine
little
pool
about
the
golden
cockatoos
he
must
have
been
a
animal
at
any
time
being
built
quite
square
like
a
toy
dog
with
a
great
deal
of
hair
very
short
legs
and
a
thick
stubborn
neck
his
eyes
were
brown
and
now
could
be
seen
very
clearly
because
the
hair
that
usually
covered
them
was
plastered
about
his
face
by
the
snow
in
his
normal
day
his
eyes
gleamed
behind
his
hair
like
sunlight
in
a
thick
wood
he
wore
a
little
pointed
beard
that
could
only
be
considered
an
affectation
in
one
word
if
you
imagine
a
ridiculously
small
with
no
legs
a
french
beard
and
a
stump
of
a
tail
you
have
him
and
if
you
want
to
know
more
than
that
i
can
only
refer
you
to
the
description
of
his
jacob
described
in
the
chronicles
of
the
beaminster
family
the
children
meanwhile
gazed
and
for
a
long
time
no
one
said
a
word
then
helen
said
father
will
be
but
she
did
not
mean
it
the
three
were
by
the
entrance
of
the
dog
instantly
united
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
they
knew
well
that
shortly
an
attack
from
the
outside
world
must
be
delivered
and
without
a
word
spoken
or
a
look
exchanged
they
were
agreed
to
defend
both
themselves
and
the
dog
with
all
the
strength
in
their
power
they
had
always
wanted
a
dog
they
had
been
prevented
by
the
stupid
and
selfish
arguments
of
uncomprehending
elders
now
this
dog
was
here
they
would
keep
him
oh
he
perfectly
sweet
suddenly
said
helen
the
dog
paused
for
a
moment
from
his
ablutions
raised
his
eyes
and
regarded
her
with
a
look
of
cold
contempt
then
returned
to
his
task
do
be
so
silly
said
jeremy
you
know
you
always
hate
it
when
aunt
amy
says
things
like
that
about
did
nurse
see
asked
mary
no
she
did
said
jeremy
but
she
be
up
in
a
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
mary
her
mouth
wide
open
do
keep
him
of
course
said
jeremy
stoutly
at
the
same
time
his
heart
a
little
failed
him
as
he
saw
the
pool
of
the
water
slowly
spreading
and
embracing
one
cockatoo
after
another
in
its
ruinous
flood
we
ought
to
wipe
him
with
a
towel
said
jeremy
if
we
could
get
him
dry
before
nurse
comes
up
she
might
say
so
but
alas
it
was
too
late
for
any
towel
the
door
opened
and
the
jampot
entered
humming
a
hymn
very
cheerful
and
rosy
from
the
kitchen
fire
and
an
abundant
series
of
chronicles
of
human
failings
and
misfortunes
the
hymn
ceased
abruptly
she
stayed
there
where
she
was
frozen
into
an
image
as
she
afterwards
described
it
she
also
said
you
could
knocked
me
down
with
a
the
dog
did
not
look
at
her
but
crocked
under
him
the
leg
that
had
been
stiff
like
a
ramrod
and
spread
out
another
the
children
did
not
speak
well
for
a
moment
words
failed
her
then
she
began
her
hands
spread
out
as
though
she
was
addressing
a
suffragette
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
she
knew
happy
woman
nothing
of
suffragettes
of
all
the
things
and
it
you
master
jeremy
that
done
it
as
anyone
might
have
guessed
by
the
way
you
been
this
last
fortnight
and
what
come
over
you
is
more
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
can
tell
which
i
was
saying
only
yesterday
to
your
mother
that
it
more
than
one
body
and
pair
of
hands
is
up
to
the
managing
of
now
you
got
so
wild
and
wicked
and
wherever
from
did
you
get
the
dirty
animal
dropping
water
all
over
the
nursery
carpet
and
smelling
awful
i
be
bound
which
anyone
can
see
that
got
eyes
and
you
know
what
your
father
will
do
to
you
when
he
knows
of
it
and
so
he
shall
as
sure
as
my
name
is
lizzie
preston
go
on
out
you
ugly
dirty
you
creature
you
i
but
her
advance
was
stopped
jeremy
stopped
it
standing
in
front
of
the
dog
his
short
thick
legs
spread
defiantly
apart
his
fists
clenched
he
almost
shouted
you
sha
touch
him
no
you
sha
i
do
care
he
sha
go
out
again
and
die
you
a
cruel
wicked
the
jampot
gasped
never
no
never
in
all
her
long
nursing
experience
had
she
been
so
defied
so
insulted
her
teeth
clicked
as
always
when
her
temper
was
roused
the
reason
being
that
thirty
years
ago
the
arts
and
accomplishments
of
dentistry
had
not
reached
so
fine
a
perfection
as
can
show
she
had
moreover
bought
a
cheap
set
her
teeth
clicked
she
began
the
moment
your
mother
comes
i
give
her
notice
to
think
that
all
these
years
i
slaved
and
slaved
only
to
be
told
such
things
by
a
boy
as
then
a
very
dramatic
thing
occurred
the
door
opened
just
as
it
might
in
the
third
act
of
a
play
by
sardou
and
revealed
the
smiling
faces
of
cole
miss
amy
trefusis
and
the
rev
william
jellybrand
senior
curate
of
james
orange
street
jellybrand
had
arrived
as
he
very
often
did
to
tea
he
had
expressed
a
desire
as
he
very
often
did
to
see
the
dear
cole
liking
to
show
her
children
to
visitors
even
to
such
regular
and
ordinary
ones
as
jellybrand
at
once
was
eager
to
gratify
his
desire
we
catch
them
just
before
their
tea
she
said
happily
there
is
an
unfortunate
tendency
on
the
part
of
our
press
and
stage
to
caricature
our
curates
this
tendency
i
would
willingly
avoid
it
should
be
easy
enough
to
do
as
i
am
writing
about
polchester
a
town
that
simply
abounds
and
also
abounded
thirty
years
ago
in
curates
of
the
most
splendid
and
manly
type
but
unfortunately
jellybrand
was
not
one
of
these
i
myself
remember
him
very
well
and
can
see
him
now
flinging
his
thin
black
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
gigantic
figure
up
orange
street
his
coat
flapping
behind
him
his
enormous
boots
flapping
in
front
of
him
and
his
huge
hands
flapping
on
each
side
of
him
like
a
huge
gesticulating
crow
he
had
the
polchester
people
who
liked
him
said
a
rich
the
others
who
did
not
like
him
called
him
an
affected
he
ran
up
and
down
the
scale
like
this
dear
my
cole
and
his
blue
cheeks
looked
colder
than
any
iceberg
but
then
i
must
confess
that
i
am
prejudiced
i
did
not
like
him
no
children
did
the
cole
children
hated
him
jeremy
because
he
had
damp
hands
helen
because
he
never
looked
at
her
mary
because
he
once
said
to
her
little
girls
must
play
as
well
as
work
you
he
always
talked
down
to
us
as
though
we
were
beings
of
another
and
inferior
planet
he
called
it
getting
on
with
the
little
no
he
was
not
popular
with
us
he
stood
on
this
particular
and
dramatic
occasion
in
front
of
the
group
in
the
doorway
and
stared
as
well
he
might
unfortunately
the
situation
already
bad
enough
was
aggravated
by
this
dark
prominence
of
jellybrand
it
can
not
be
found
in
any
chronicles
that
jellybrand
and
the
dog
had
met
before
it
is
simply
a
fact
that
the
dog
raising
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
catching
sight
of
the
figure
forgot
instantly
his
toilet
rose
dripping
from
his
rug
and
advanced
growling
his
lips
back
his
ears
out
his
tail
erect
towards
the
door
then
everything
happened
together
jellybrand
who
had
been
afraid
of
dogs
ever
since
as
an
infant
he
had
been
mistaken
for
a
bone
by
a
large
retriever
stepped
back
upon
aunt
amy
who
uttered
a
shrill
cry
cole
although
she
did
not
forsake
her
accustomed
placidity
said
nurse
nurse
jeremy
cried
it
all
right
he
would
touch
anything
he
only
mary
and
helen
together
moved
forward
as
though
to
protect
jeremy
and
the
jampot
could
be
heard
in
a
confused
wail
not
me
mum
wickedest
boy
better
give
notice
as
never
listens
dog
dog
the
animal
however
showed
himself
now
as
at
that
first
earlier
view
of
him
indifferent
to
his
surroundings
he
continued
his
advance
and
then
being
only
a
fraction
of
an
inch
from
jellybrand
tempting
gleaming
black
trousers
he
stopped
crouched
like
a
tiger
and
with
teeth
still
bared
continued
his
reverberations
aunt
amy
who
hated
dogs
loved
jellybrand
and
was
not
in
the
least
sentimental
when
her
personal
safety
was
in
danger
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
but
take
it
away
take
it
away
alice
tell
him
it
going
to
bite
the
dog
raised
one
eye
from
his
dreamy
contemplation
of
the
trousers
and
glanced
at
aunt
amy
from
that
moment
may
be
dated
a
feud
which
death
only
concluded
this
dog
was
not
a
forgetful
dog
jeremy
advanced
it
all
right
he
cried
scornfully
he
bite
he
bent
down
took
the
animal
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
proceeded
to
lead
it
back
to
the
fire
the
animal
went
without
a
moment
hesitation
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
it
exchanged
a
wink
with
jeremy
but
something
certainly
passed
between
them
back
again
on
the
turkey
rug
he
became
master
of
the
situation
he
did
the
only
thing
possible
he
disregarded
entirely
the
general
company
and
addressed
himself
to
the
only
person
of
ultimate
importance
namely
cole
he
lay
down
on
all
fours
looked
up
directly
into
her
face
bared
his
teeth
this
time
in
a
smile
and
not
in
a
growl
and
wagged
his
farcical
tail
cole
psychology
was
of
the
simplest
if
you
were
nice
to
her
she
would
do
anything
for
you
but
in
spite
of
all
her
placidity
she
was
sometimes
hurt
in
her
most
sensitive
places
these
wounds
she
never
displayed
and
no
one
ever
knew
of
them
and
indeed
they
passed
very
quickly
but
there
they
occasionally
were
now
on
what
slender
circumstances
do
the
fates
of
dogs
and
mortals
hang
only
that
afternoon
jellybrand
in
the
innocent
of
his
heart
had
agreed
with
miss
maple
an
elderly
and
bitter
spinster
that
the
next
sewing
meeting
of
the
dorcas
sisterhood
should
be
held
in
her
house
and
not
at
the
rectory
he
had
told
cole
of
this
on
his
way
upstairs
to
the
nursery
now
cole
liked
the
dorcas
meetings
at
the
rectory
she
liked
the
cheerful
chatter
the
hospitality
the
gentle
scandal
and
her
own
position
as
hostess
she
did
not
like
she
never
liked
miss
maple
who
was
always
pushing
herself
forward
criticising
and
jellybrand
should
not
have
settled
this
without
consulting
her
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
would
agree
he
had
said
i
agreed
with
miss
maple
that
it
would
be
better
to
have
it
at
her
house
i
sure
you
will
think
as
i
why
should
he
be
sure
was
he
not
forgetting
his
position
a
little
kindest
woman
in
the
world
she
had
seen
with
a
strange
pleasure
the
dog
advance
upon
the
black
trousers
then
jellybrand
had
been
obviously
afraid
he
fancied
perhaps
that
she
too
had
been
afraid
he
fancied
perhaps
that
she
was
not
mistress
in
her
house
that
she
could
be
browbeaten
by
her
sister
and
her
nurse
she
smiled
at
him
there
no
reason
to
be
afraid
jellybrand
he
such
a
little
then
the
dog
smiled
at
her
poor
little
thing
she
said
he
must
have
nearly
died
in
the
thus
miss
maple
bitterest
of
spinsters
influenced
all
unwitting
the
lives
not
only
of
a
dog
and
a
curate
but
of
the
entire
cole
family
and
through
them
of
endless
generations
both
of
dogs
and
men
as
yet
unborn
miss
maple
sitting
in
her
little
parlour
drinking
in
jaundiced
contentment
her
afternoon
cup
of
tea
was
of
course
unaware
of
this
a
good
thing
that
she
was
unaware
she
was
quite
conceited
enough
already
iv
after
that
smiling
judgment
of
cole
affairs
were
quickly
settled
of
course
it
can
only
be
for
the
night
children
father
will
arrange
something
in
the
morning
poor
little
thing
where
did
you
find
him
we
saw
him
from
the
window
said
jeremy
quickly
and
he
was
shivering
like
anything
so
we
called
him
in
to
warm
my
dear
alice
you
surely
do
mean
began
aunt
amy
and
the
jampot
said
i
really
think
and
jellybrand
in
his
rich
voice
murmured
is
it
quite
wise
dear
cole
do
you
think
with
thoughts
of
miss
maple
she
smiled
upon
them
all
oh
for
one
night
i
think
we
can
manage
he
seems
a
clean
little
dog
and
really
we
ca
turn
him
out
into
the
snow
at
once
it
would
be
too
cruel
but
mind
children
it
only
for
one
night
he
looks
a
good
little
when
the
quality
had
departed
jeremy
mind
was
in
a
confused
condition
of
horror
and
delight
such
a
victory
as
he
had
won
over
the
jampot
a
victory
that
was
a
further
stage
in
the
fight
for
independence
begun
on
his
birthday
might
have
very
awful
qualities
there
would
begin
now
one
of
the
jampot
sulks
moods
well
known
to
the
cole
family
and
lasting
from
a
day
to
a
week
according
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence
yes
they
had
already
begun
there
she
sat
in
her
chair
by
the
fire
sewing
sewing
her
fat
face
carved
into
a
parody
of
deep
displeasure
life
would
be
very
unpleasant
now
no
tops
of
eggs
no
marmalade
on
toast
no
skins
of
milk
no
stories
of
when
i
was
a
young
girl
no
sitting
up
five
minutes
later
no
stopping
in
the
for
a
talk
with
the
banana
woman
only
stern
insistence
on
every
detail
of
daily
life
swift
judgment
were
anything
left
undone
or
done
wrong
jeremy
sighed
yes
it
would
be
horrid
and
for
the
sake
of
the
world
in
general
which
meant
mary
and
helen
he
must
see
what
a
little
diplomacy
would
do
kneeling
down
by
the
dog
he
looked
up
into
her
face
with
the
gaze
of
ingenuous
innocence
you
would
have
wanted
the
poor
little
dog
to
have
died
in
the
snow
would
you
nurse
it
might
you
know
it
wo
be
any
trouble
i
expect
there
was
no
reply
he
could
hear
mary
and
helen
drawing
in
their
breaths
with
excited
attention
father
always
said
we
might
have
a
dog
one
day
when
we
were
older
and
we
are
older
still
no
word
we
be
extra
good
nurse
if
you
do
mind
do
you
remember
once
you
said
you
had
a
dog
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
how
you
cried
when
it
had
its
ear
bitten
off
by
a
nasty
big
dog
and
how
your
mother
said
she
would
have
it
fighting
round
the
house
and
sent
it
away
and
you
cried
and
cried
and
cried
and
how
you
said
that
have
one
one
day
and
now
we
got
he
ended
triumphantly
she
raised
her
eyes
for
one
moment
stared
at
them
all
bit
off
a
piece
of
thread
and
said
in
deep
sepulchral
tones
either
it
goes
or
i
the
three
stared
at
one
another
the
jampot
go
really
go
they
could
hear
their
hearts
thumping
one
after
another
the
jampot
go
oh
nurse
would
you
really
whispered
mary
this
innocent
remark
of
mary
conveyed
in
the
tone
of
it
more
pleased
anticipation
than
was
perhaps
polite
certainly
the
jampot
felt
this
a
flood
of
colour
rose
into
her
face
her
mouth
opened
but
what
she
would
have
said
is
uncertain
for
at
that
very
moment
the
drama
was
further
developed
by
the
slow
movement
of
the
door
and
the
revelation
of
half
of
uncle
samuel
body
clothed
in
its
stained
blue
painting
smock
and
his
ugly
fat
face
clothed
in
its
usual
sarcastic
smile
excuse
me
one
moment
he
said
i
hear
you
have
a
the
jampot
rose
as
good
manners
demanded
but
said
nothing
where
is
the
creature
he
asked
the
new
addition
to
the
cole
family
had
finished
his
washing
the
blazing
fire
had
almost
dried
him
and
his
hair
stuck
out
now
from
his
body
in
little
stiff
prickles
hedgehog
fashion
giving
him
a
truly
original
appearance
his
beard
afforded
him
the
air
of
an
ambassador
and
his
grave
melancholy
eyes
the
absorbed
introspection
of
a
spanish
hidalgo
his
tail
however
in
its
upright
stumpy
jocularity
betrayed
his
dignity
there
he
is
said
jeremy
with
a
glance
half
of
terror
half
of
delight
at
the
jampot
is
he
lovely
lovely
my
word
uncle
samuel
smile
broadened
he
about
the
most
hideous
mongrel
it
ever
been
my
lot
to
set
eyes
on
but
he
has
his
points
he
despises
you
all
i
glad
to
jeremy
as
usual
with
uncle
samuel
was
uncertain
as
to
his
sincerity
he
looks
a
bit
funny
just
now
he
explained
he
been
drying
on
the
rug
he
be
all
right
soon
he
wanted
to
bite
jellybrand
it
was
funny
jellybrand
was
frightened
as
yes
that
must
have
been
delightful
agreed
uncle
samuel
what
his
name
we
have
given
him
one
yet
would
you
think
of
one
uncle
samuel
the
uncle
considered
the
dog
the
dog
with
grave
and
scornful
eyes
considered
the
uncle
well
if
you
really
ask
me
said
that
gentleman
if
you
name
him
by
his
character
i
should
say
hamlet
would
be
as
good
as
what
hamlet
asked
jeremy
he
is
anything
just
now
but
he
was
a
prince
who
was
unhappy
because
he
thought
so
much
about
hamlet
do
said
jeremy
comfortably
i
never
heard
of
a
dog
called
that
but
it
easy
to
well
i
must
go
said
uncle
samuel
making
one
of
his
usual
sudden
departures
glad
to
have
seen
the
animal
he
vanished
hamlet
repeated
jeremy
thoughtfully
i
wonder
whether
he
like
his
attention
however
was
caught
by
the
jampot
sudden
outburst
all
of
them
she
cried
supporting
you
in
your
wickedness
and
disobedience
i
wo
it
nor
endure
it
not
a
minute
longer
they
can
my
notice
this
moment
and
i
wo
take
it
back
not
if
they
ask
me
on
their
bended
knees
no
i
wo
and
that
for
an
instant
she
frowned
upon
them
all
then
she
was
gone
the
door
banging
after
her
they
gazed
at
one
another
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
once
mary
whispered
suppose
she
really
hamlet
only
was
unmoved
ten
minutes
later
rose
the
housemaid
entered
with
the
for
a
little
she
was
silent
then
the
three
faces
raised
to
hers
compelled
her
confidence
nurse
has
been
and
given
notice
she
said
and
the
missis
has
taken
it
she
going
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
crying
now
in
the
they
were
alone
again
mary
and
helen
looked
at
jeremy
as
though
waiting
to
follow
his
lead
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
there
was
tragedy
there
was
victory
there
was
remorse
there
was
triumph
he
was
sorry
he
was
glad
his
eyes
fell
upon
hamlet
who
was
now
stretched
out
upon
the
rug
his
nose
between
his
paws
fast
asleep
then
he
looked
at
his
sisters
well
he
said
slowly
it
awfully
nice
to
have
a
dog
such
is
the
true
and
faithful
account
of
hamlet
entrance
into
the
train
of
the
coles
chapter
iii
christmas
pantomime
i
i
am
sometimes
inclined
to
wonder
whether
in
very
truth
those
polchester
christmases
of
nearly
thirty
years
ago
were
so
marvellous
as
now
in
retrospect
they
seem
i
can
give
details
of
those
splendours
facts
and
figures
that
to
the
onlooker
are
less
than
nothing
at
all
a
sugar
elephant
in
a
stocking
a
box
of
pencils
on
a
christmas
tree
hark
the
herald
angels
at
three
in
the
morning
below
one
window
a
lighted
a
postman
four
hours
late
his
back
bent
with
bursting
parcels
and
it
is
something
further
behind
the
sugar
cherries
and
the
paper
caps
and
the
lighted
tree
that
remains
to
give
magic
to
those
days
a
sense
of
expectancy
a
sense
of
richness
a
sense
of
worship
a
visit
from
the
three
kings
who
have
so
seldom
come
to
visit
one
since
that
christmas
of
jeremy
ninth
year
was
one
of
the
best
that
he
ever
had
it
was
perhaps
the
last
of
the
magical
christmases
after
this
he
was
to
know
too
much
was
to
see
father
christmas
vanish
before
a
sum
in
arithmetic
and
a
stocking
change
into
something
that
boys
who
go
to
school
never
have
the
last
of
the
christmases
of
divine
magic
when
the
snow
fell
and
the
waits
sang
and
the
stockings
were
filled
and
the
turkey
fattened
and
the
candles
blazed
and
the
holly
crackled
by
the
will
of
god
rather
than
the
power
of
man
it
would
be
many
years
before
he
would
realise
that
after
all
in
those
early
days
he
had
been
right
a
very
fat
book
could
be
written
about
all
that
had
happened
during
that
wonderful
christmas
how
hamlet
the
dog
caught
a
rat
to
his
own
immense
surprise
how
the
coles
christmas
dinner
was
followed
by
a
play
acted
with
complete
success
by
the
junior
members
of
the
family
and
it
was
only
jellybrand
the
curate
who
disapproved
how
aunt
amy
had
a
new
dress
in
which
by
general
consent
she
looked
ridiculous
how
mary
owing
to
the
foolish
kindness
of
bartholomew
the
precentor
wife
was
introduced
to
the
works
of
charlotte
mary
yonge
and
became
quite
impossible
in
consequence
how
miss
maple
had
a
children
party
at
which
there
was
nothing
to
eat
so
that
all
the
children
cried
with
disappointment
and
one
small
boy
the
youngest
son
of
the
precentor
actually
bit
miss
maple
how
for
two
whole
days
it
really
seemed
that
there
would
be
skating
on
the
pool
and
everyone
bought
skates
and
then
of
course
the
ice
broke
and
so
on
and
so
on
there
is
no
end
to
the
dramatic
incidents
of
that
great
sensational
time
the
theme
that
i
sing
however
is
jeremy
progress
and
although
even
hamlet
catching
of
a
rat
influenced
his
development
there
was
one
incident
of
this
christmas
that
stands
out
and
away
from
all
the
others
an
affair
that
he
will
never
all
his
days
forget
and
that
even
now
at
this
distance
of
time
and
experience
causes
his
heart
to
beat
roughly
with
the
remembered
excitement
and
pleasure
several
weeks
before
christmas
there
appeared
upon
the
town
walls
and
hoardings
the
pictured
announcements
of
the
approaching
visit
to
polchester
of
denny
great
christmas
pantomime
dick
boxing
night
was
to
see
the
first
performance
at
our
assembly
rooms
and
during
every
afternoon
and
evening
of
the
next
three
weeks
this
performance
was
to
be
repeated
a
pantomime
had
i
believe
never
visited
our
town
before
there
had
of
course
for
many
years
been
the
great
christmas
pantomime
at
the
theatre
royal
drymouth
but
in
those
days
trains
were
not
easy
and
if
you
wished
to
attend
an
afternoon
performance
at
the
drymouth
theatre
you
must
rise
very
early
in
the
morning
by
the
and
return
late
in
the
evening
with
the
cab
forgetting
to
meet
you
at
the
station
as
commanded
and
the
long
walk
up
orange
street
and
a
headache
and
a
bad
temper
next
day
it
happened
naturally
then
that
the
majority
of
the
polchester
children
had
never
set
their
inquisitive
noses
within
the
doors
of
a
theatre
and
although
the
two
eldest
daughters
of
the
dean
aged
ten
and
eleven
had
been
once
to
london
and
to
drury
lane
theatre
their
sense
of
glory
and
distinction
so
clouded
their
powers
of
accuracy
and
clarity
that
we
were
no
nearer
by
their
help
and
authority
to
the
understanding
of
what
a
pantomime
might
really
be
i
can
myself
recall
the
glory
of
those
dick
whittington
pictures
just
above
martin
the
where
they
sold
lemon
biscuits
near
the
cathedral
there
was
a
big
wooden
hoarding
and
on
to
this
was
pasted
a
marvellous
representation
of
dick
and
his
cat
dining
with
the
king
of
the
zanzibar
islands
the
king
a
mulatto
sat
with
his
court
in
a
hall
with
golden
pillars
and
the
rats
were
to
be
seen
flying
in
a
confused
flood
towards
the
golden
gates
whilst
dick
in
red
plush
and
diamond
buckles
stood
in
dignified
majesty
the
cat
at
his
side
there
was
another
wonderful
picture
of
dick
asleep
at
the
cross
roads
fairies
watching
over
him
and
london
town
in
a
lighted
purple
distance
and
another
of
the
streets
of
old
london
with
a
comic
fat
serving
man
windows
cobblestones
and
high
pointing
eaves
to
the
houses
jeremy
saw
these
pictures
for
the
first
time
during
one
of
his
afternoon
walks
and
returned
home
in
such
a
state
of
choking
excitement
that
he
could
not
drink
his
tea
as
was
ever
his
way
he
was
silent
and
controlled
about
the
matter
asked
very
few
questions
and
although
he
talked
to
himself
a
little
did
not
disturb
the
general
peace
of
the
nursery
on
mary
and
helen
the
effect
of
the
posters
had
been
less
mary
was
following
the
adventures
of
the
may
family
in
the
daisy
chain
and
helen
was
making
necklaces
for
herself
out
of
a
box
of
beads
that
had
been
given
her
when
jeremy
said
once
who
was
the
man
in
the
red
trousers
with
gold
on
them
no
one
paid
any
attention
save
hamlet
who
wagged
his
tail
looked
wise
and
growled
a
little
who
indeed
could
tell
how
he
ached
and
longed
and
desired
he
had
a
very
vague
idea
as
to
the
nature
of
a
play
they
had
often
dressed
up
at
home
and
pretended
to
be
different
things
and
people
and
of
course
he
knew
by
heart
the
whole
history
of
dick
whittington
but
this
knowledge
and
experience
did
not
in
the
least
force
him
to
realise
that
this
performance
of
denny
was
simply
a
larger
more
developed
dressing
up
and
pretending
in
some
mysterious
but
nevertheless
direct
fashion
dick
whittington
was
coming
to
polchester
it
was
just
as
he
had
heard
for
a
long
time
of
the
existence
of
aunt
emily
who
lived
in
manchester
and
then
one
day
she
appeared
in
a
black
bonnet
and
a
shawl
and
gave
them
wet
kisses
and
sixpence
apiece
dick
whittington
was
coming
having
perhaps
heard
that
polchester
was
a
very
jolly
place
so
might
come
any
day
jack
of
the
beanstalk
cinderella
queen
victoria
and
god
there
were
questions
meanwhile
that
he
would
like
to
ask
but
he
was
already
a
victim
to
that
properly
english
fear
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
so
he
asked
nothing
he
dragged
out
his
toy
village
and
tried
to
make
it
a
bridge
in
his
imagination
between
the
nursery
and
whittington
world
as
the
village
opened
a
door
from
the
nursery
so
might
whittington
open
a
door
from
the
village
he
considered
hamlet
and
wondered
whether
he
knew
anything
about
it
hamlet
in
spite
of
his
mongrel
appearance
was
a
very
clever
dog
he
had
his
especial
corners
in
the
garden
the
kitchen
and
the
nursery
he
never
misbehaved
was
never
in
the
way
and
was
able
to
amuse
himself
for
hours
together
although
he
attached
himself
quite
deliberately
to
jeremy
he
did
this
in
no
sentimental
fashion
and
in
his
animosities
towards
the
jampot
aunt
amy
and
the
boy
who
helped
with
the
boots
and
the
knives
he
was
always
restrained
and
courteous
he
did
indeed
growl
at
aunt
amy
but
always
with
such
a
sense
of
humour
that
everyone
except
aunt
amy
was
charmed
and
he
never
actually
supported
the
children
in
their
rebellions
against
the
jampot
although
you
could
see
that
he
liked
and
approved
of
such
things
the
jampot
hated
him
with
a
passion
that
caused
the
nursery
to
quiver
with
emotion
was
he
not
the
cause
of
her
approaching
departure
his
first
appearance
having
led
her
into
a
tempest
of
passion
that
had
caused
her
to
offer
a
notice
that
she
had
never
for
an
instant
imagined
would
be
accepted
was
he
not
a
devilish
dog
who
with
his
quiet
movements
and
sly
expressions
was
more
than
human
mark
my
words
she
said
in
the
kitchen
a
devil
in
that
there
animal
and
so
they
find
before
they
many
years
older
indeed
a
name
and
a
her
enemy
had
discovered
that
in
one
corner
of
the
nursery
there
were
signs
and
symbols
that
witnessed
to
something
in
the
nature
of
a
mouse
or
a
rat
that
nursery
corner
became
the
centre
of
all
his
more
adventurous
instincts
it
happened
to
be
just
the
corner
where
the
jampot
kept
her
sewing
machine
and
you
would
think
if
you
came
to
the
nursery
as
a
stranger
and
saw
him
sitting
his
eyes
fixed
beamingly
upon
the
machine
his
tail
erect
and
his
body
here
and
there
quivering
a
little
that
from
duties
of
manly
devotion
he
was
protecting
the
jampot
property
she
knew
better
she
regarded
in
some
undefined
way
this
continued
contemplation
by
him
of
her
possessions
as
an
ironical
insult
she
did
everything
possible
to
drive
him
from
the
corner
he
inevitably
returned
and
as
he
always
delicately
stepped
aside
when
she
approached
it
could
not
be
said
that
he
was
in
her
way
once
she
struck
him
he
looked
at
her
in
such
a
fashion
that
her
flesh
she
never
struck
him
again
for
jeremy
he
became
more
and
more
of
a
delight
he
understood
so
much
he
sympathised
he
congratulated
he
sported
always
at
the
right
moment
he
would
sit
gravely
at
jeremy
feet
his
body
pressed
against
jeremy
leg
one
leg
stuck
out
square
his
eyes
fixed
inquisitively
upon
the
nursery
scene
he
would
be
motionless
then
suddenly
some
thought
would
electrify
him
his
ears
would
cock
his
eyes
shine
his
nose
quiver
his
tail
tumble
the
crisis
would
pass
he
would
be
composed
once
more
he
would
slide
down
to
the
floor
his
whole
body
collapsing
his
head
would
rest
upon
jeremy
foot
he
would
dream
of
cats
of
rats
of
birds
of
the
jampot
of
beef
and
gravy
of
sugar
of
being
washed
of
the
dogs
valhalla
of
fire
and
warmth
of
jeremy
of
walks
when
every
piece
of
flying
paper
was
a
challenge
of
dogs
dogs
that
he
had
known
of
when
he
was
a
puppy
of
doing
things
he
should
of
punishment
and
wisdom
pride
and
anger
of
of
his
youth
of
battle
of
of
in
the
future
again
of
cats
and
beef
and
smells
smells
smells
again
of
jeremy
whom
he
loved
and
jeremy
watching
him
now
thus
sleeping
and
thinking
of
dick
whittington
wondered
why
it
was
that
a
dog
would
understand
so
easily
without
explanations
the
thoughts
and
desires
he
had
and
that
all
people
would
not
understand
and
would
demand
so
many
explanations
and
would
laugh
at
one
and
pity
one
and
despise
one
why
was
it
he
asked
himself
i
know
he
suddenly
cried
turning
upon
helen
it
can
be
your
birthday
treat
what
can
she
asked
why
going
to
dick
whittington
all
of
helen
had
most
unfortunately
for
herself
a
birthday
only
a
week
after
christmas
the
result
being
that
in
her
own
opinion
at
any
rate
she
never
received
proper
presents
on
either
of
those
two
great
occasions
she
was
always
allowed
however
a
treat
her
requests
were
generally
in
the
nature
of
food
once
of
a
ride
in
the
train
once
even
a
visit
to
the
polchester
museum
it
was
difficult
in
those
days
to
find
treats
in
polchester
oh
do
you
think
they
let
us
she
said
her
eyes
wide
we
can
try
said
jeremy
i
heard
aunt
amy
say
the
other
day
that
she
did
think
it
was
right
for
children
to
see
acting
and
mother
always
does
the
opposite
to
what
aunt
amy
says
so
it
will
be
all
right
i
wish
hamlet
could
go
he
added
do
be
silly
said
helen
it
is
silly
jeremy
said
indignantly
it
all
about
a
cat
anyway
and
he
love
to
see
all
the
rats
and
things
he
would
bark
if
we
told
him
not
to
and
i
held
his
if
aunt
amy
sat
next
him
he
would
said
mary
oh
bother
aunt
amy
said
jeremy
after
this
helen
needed
a
great
deal
of
urging
but
she
heard
that
lucy
and
angela
the
aforesaid
daughters
of
the
dean
were
going
and
the
spirit
of
rivalry
drove
her
forward
it
happened
that
the
dean
himself
one
day
said
something
to
cole
about
supporting
a
very
praiseworthy
effort
they
are
presenting
i
understand
the
proceeds
of
the
first
performance
to
the
cathedral
helen
was
surprised
at
the
readiness
with
which
her
request
was
granted
we
all
go
said
cole
in
his
genial
pastoral
fashion
good
for
us
good
for
us
to
see
the
little
ones
laugh
good
for
us
only
uncle
samuel
said
that
nothing
would
induce
him
ii
i
pass
swiftly
over
christmas
eve
christmas
day
and
the
day
after
although
i
should
like
to
linger
upon
these
sumptuous
dates
jeremy
had
a
sumptuous
time
hamlet
had
a
sumptuous
time
a
whole
sugar
rat
plates
and
plates
of
bones
and
a
shoe
of
aunt
amy
mary
and
helen
had
sumptuous
times
in
their
own
feminine
fashion
upon
the
evening
of
christmas
eve
when
the
earth
was
and
the
sparkled
with
crystals
and
the
rime
on
the
doorsteps
crackled
beneath
one
feet
jeremy
accompanied
his
mother
on
a
expedition
the
excitement
of
that
the
wonderful
shapes
and
sizes
of
the
parcels
the
mysterious
streets
the
and
the
the
glittering
stars
the
maidservants
the
sense
of
the
lighted
house
as
though
you
opened
a
box
full
of
excitements
and
then
hurriedly
shut
the
lid
down
again
jeremy
trembled
and
shook
not
with
cold
but
with
exalting
completely
satisfying
happiness
there
followed
the
stocking
the
waits
the
carols
the
turkey
the
christmas
cake
the
tree
the
presents
snapdragon
bed
there
followed
headache
smacking
of
mary
afternoon
walk
good
temper
again
complete
weariness
hamlet
sick
on
the
golden
cockatoos
hamlet
beaten
five
minutes
with
mother
downstairs
bed
christmas
was
over
from
that
moment
of
the
passing
of
boxing
day
it
was
simply
the
counting
of
the
minutes
to
dick
six
days
from
boxing
day
say
you
slept
from
eight
to
seven
eleven
hours
that
left
thirteen
hours
six
thirteen
hours
was
so
helen
said
hours
and
sunday
twice
as
long
as
the
other
days
and
that
made
thirteen
more
said
helen
her
nose
in
the
air
the
week
dragged
along
very
difficult
work
for
everybody
and
even
hamlet
felt
the
excitement
and
watched
his
corner
with
the
sewing
machine
in
it
with
more
quivering
intensity
than
ever
the
day
before
the
day
arrived
the
evening
before
the
day
the
last
supper
before
the
day
the
last
bed
before
the
day
suddenly
like
a
the
day
itself
then
the
awful
thing
happened
jeremy
awoke
to
the
consciousness
that
something
terrific
was
about
to
occur
he
lay
for
a
minute
thinking
then
he
was
up
running
about
the
nursery
floor
as
though
he
were
a
young
man
in
rossetti
poetry
shouting
helen
mary
mary
helen
it
dick
whittington
dick
whittington
on
such
occasions
he
lost
entirely
his
natural
reserve
and
caution
he
dressed
with
immense
speed
as
though
that
would
hasten
the
coming
of
the
evening
he
ran
into
the
nursery
carrying
the
black
tie
that
went
under
his
he
held
it
out
to
the
jampot
who
eyed
him
with
disfavour
she
was
leaving
them
all
in
a
week
and
was
a
strange
confusion
of
sentiment
and
bad
temper
love
and
hatred
wounded
pride
and
injured
dignity
nurse
please
fasten
it
he
said
impatiently
and
that
not
the
way
to
speak
master
jeremy
and
well
you
know
it
she
said
you
cleaned
your
teeth
yes
he
answered
without
hesitation
it
was
not
until
the
word
was
spoken
that
he
realised
that
he
had
not
he
flushed
the
jampot
eyed
him
with
a
sudden
sharp
suspicion
he
was
then
and
ever
afterwards
a
very
bad
hand
at
a
lie
he
would
have
taken
the
word
back
he
wanted
to
take
it
back
but
something
held
him
as
though
a
stronger
than
he
had
placed
his
hand
over
his
mouth
his
face
flamed
you
truly
cleaned
them
she
said
yes
truly
he
answered
his
eyes
on
the
ground
never
was
there
a
more
obvious
liar
in
all
the
world
she
said
no
more
he
moved
to
the
fireplace
his
joy
was
gone
there
was
a
cold
clammy
sensation
about
his
heart
slowly
very
slowly
the
consciousness
stole
upon
him
that
he
was
a
liar
he
had
not
thought
it
a
lie
when
he
had
first
spoken
now
he
knew
still
there
was
time
had
he
turned
round
and
spoken
all
might
still
have
been
well
but
now
obstinacy
held
him
he
was
not
going
to
give
the
jampot
an
opportunity
for
triumphing
over
him
after
all
he
would
clean
them
so
soon
as
she
went
to
brush
helen
hair
in
a
moment
what
he
had
said
would
be
true
but
he
was
miserable
hamlet
came
up
from
the
nether
regions
where
he
had
spent
the
night
showing
his
teeth
wagging
his
tail
and
even
rolling
on
the
cockatoos
jeremy
paid
no
attention
the
weight
in
his
heart
grew
heavier
and
heavier
he
watched
from
under
his
eyelids
the
jampot
in
a
moment
she
must
go
into
helen
room
but
she
did
not
she
stayed
for
a
little
arranging
the
things
on
the
then
suddenly
without
a
word
she
turned
into
jeremy
bedchamber
his
heart
began
to
hammer
there
was
an
awful
pause
he
heard
from
miles
away
mary
voice
do
do
that
button
helen
i
ca
get
it
and
oh
bother
then
like
judgment
the
jampot
appeared
again
she
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
across
at
him
you
not
cleaned
your
teeth
master
jeremy
she
said
the
glass
is
touched
nor
your
toothbrush
you
wicked
wicked
boy
so
it
a
liar
you
become
added
on
to
all
your
other
i
forgot
he
muttered
sullenly
i
thought
i
she
smiled
the
smile
of
approaching
triumph
no
you
did
not
she
said
you
knew
you
told
a
lie
it
was
in
your
face
all
of
a
piece
all
of
a
the
way
she
said
this
like
a
pirate
counting
over
his
captured
treasure
was
enraging
jeremy
could
feel
the
wild
fury
at
himself
at
her
at
the
stupid
blunder
of
the
whole
business
rising
to
his
throat
if
you
think
i
going
to
let
this
pass
you
making
a
mighty
mistake
she
continued
which
i
would
do
not
if
you
paid
me
all
the
gold
in
the
kingdom
i
may
be
good
enough
to
keep
my
place
and
look
after
such
as
you
but
anyways
i
able
to
stop
your
lying
for
another
week
or
two
i
know
my
duty
even
though
there
them
as
thinks
i
she
positively
snorted
and
the
excitement
of
her
own
vindication
and
the
just
condemnation
of
jeremy
was
such
that
her
hands
trembled
i
do
care
what
you
do
jeremy
shouted
you
can
tell
anyone
you
like
i
do
care
what
you
do
you
a
beastly
she
turned
upon
him
her
face
purple
that
enough
master
jeremy
she
said
her
voice
low
and
trembling
i
not
here
to
be
called
names
by
such
as
you
you
be
sorry
for
this
before
you
much
older
you
there
was
then
an
awful
and
sickly
pause
jeremy
seemed
to
himself
to
be
sinking
lower
and
lower
into
a
damp
clammy
depth
of
degradation
what
must
this
world
be
that
it
could
change
itself
so
instantly
from
a
place
of
gay
and
happy
pleasure
into
a
dim
groping
room
of
punishment
and
dismay
his
feelings
were
utterly
confused
he
supposed
that
he
was
terribly
wicked
but
he
did
not
feel
wicked
he
only
felt
miserable
sick
and
defiant
mary
and
helen
came
in
their
eyes
open
to
a
crisis
their
bodies
tuned
sympathetically
to
the
atmosphere
of
sin
and
crime
that
they
discerned
around
them
then
cole
came
in
as
was
his
daily
habit
for
a
moment
before
his
breakfast
well
here
are
you
all
he
cried
ready
for
no
breakfast
yet
why
now
then
perceiving
as
all
practised
fathers
instantly
must
that
the
atmosphere
was
sinful
he
changed
his
voice
to
that
of
the
sunday
afternoon
service
a
voice
well
known
in
his
family
please
sir
began
the
jampot
i
sorry
to
to
tell
you
sir
that
master
jeremy
not
been
at
all
good
this
well
jeremy
he
said
turning
to
his
son
what
is
it
jeremy
face
raised
to
his
father
was
hard
and
set
and
sullen
i
told
a
lie
he
said
i
said
i
cleaned
my
teeth
when
i
had
nurse
went
and
looked
and
then
i
called
her
a
beastly
the
jampot
face
expressed
a
grieved
and
at
the
same
time
triumphant
confirmation
of
this
you
told
a
lie
cole
voice
was
full
of
a
lingering
sorrow
yes
said
jeremy
are
you
sorry
i
sorry
that
i
told
a
lie
but
i
not
sorry
i
called
nurse
a
beastly
jeremy
no
i
not
she
is
a
beastly
cole
was
always
at
a
loss
when
anyone
defied
him
even
though
it
were
only
a
small
boy
of
eight
he
took
refuge
now
in
his
ecclesiastical
and
parental
authority
i
very
distressed
very
distressed
indeed
i
hope
that
punishment
jeremy
will
show
you
how
wrong
you
have
been
i
afraid
you
can
not
come
with
us
to
the
pantomime
at
that
judgement
a
quiver
for
an
instant
held
jeremy
face
turning
it
for
that
moment
into
something
shapeless
and
old
his
heart
had
given
a
wild
leap
of
terror
and
dismay
but
he
showed
no
further
sign
he
simply
stood
there
waiting
cole
was
baffled
as
he
always
was
by
jeremy
moods
so
he
continued
and
until
you
apologised
to
nurse
for
your
rudeness
you
must
remain
by
yourself
i
shall
forbid
your
sisters
to
speak
to
you
mary
and
helen
you
are
not
to
speak
to
your
brother
until
he
has
apologised
to
yes
father
said
helen
oh
father
may
he
come
said
mary
no
mary
i
afraid
a
tear
rolled
down
her
cheek
it
wo
be
any
fun
without
jeremy
she
said
she
wished
to
make
the
further
sacrifice
of
saying
that
she
would
not
go
unless
jeremy
did
but
some
natural
caution
restrained
her
cole
his
face
heavy
with
sorrow
departed
at
the
dumb
misery
of
jeremy
face
the
jampot
hear
in
reality
a
kind
and
even
sentimental
heart
repented
her
there
master
jeremy
you
be
a
good
boy
all
day
and
i
dare
say
your
father
will
take
you
after
all
and
we
wo
think
no
more
about
what
you
said
to
me
in
the
of
the
but
jeremy
answered
nothing
nor
did
he
respond
to
the
smell
of
bacon
nor
the
advances
of
hamlet
nor
the
flood
of
sunlight
that
poured
into
the
room
from
the
frosty
world
outside
a
complete
catastrophe
they
none
of
them
had
wanted
to
see
this
thing
with
the
urgent
excitement
that
he
had
felt
they
had
not
dreamt
of
it
for
days
and
nights
and
nights
and
days
as
he
had
done
their
whole
future
existence
did
not
depend
upon
their
witnessing
this
as
did
his
during
that
morning
he
was
a
desperate
creature
like
something
caged
and
tortured
do
happy
philosophers
assure
us
that
children
are
and
unfeeling
animals
let
them
realise
something
of
the
agony
which
jeremy
suffered
that
day
his
whole
world
had
gone
he
was
wicked
an
outcast
his
word
could
never
be
trusted
again
he
would
be
pointed
at
as
the
boy
who
had
told
a
lie
and
he
would
not
meet
dick
whittington
the
eternity
of
his
punishment
hung
around
his
neck
like
an
iron
chain
childhood
tragedies
are
terrible
tragedies
because
a
child
has
no
sense
of
time
a
moment
dismay
is
eternal
a
careless
word
from
an
elder
is
a
lasting
judgment
an
instant
folly
is
a
lifetime
mistake
the
day
dragged
its
weary
length
along
and
he
scarcely
moved
from
his
corner
by
the
fire
he
did
not
attempt
conversation
with
anyone
once
or
twice
the
jampot
tried
to
penetrate
behind
that
little
mask
of
anger
and
dismay
come
now
things
are
so
bad
as
all
that
you
be
a
good
boy
and
go
and
tell
your
father
you
sorry
or
well
then
master
jeremy
there
be
another
time
i
dare
say
you
can
go
to
the
but
she
found
no
response
if
there
was
one
thing
that
she
hated
it
was
sulks
here
they
were
sulks
of
the
worst
and
so
like
many
wiser
than
herself
she
covered
up
with
a
word
a
situation
that
she
did
not
understand
and
left
it
at
that
the
evening
came
on
the
curtains
were
drawn
tea
arrived
still
jeremy
sat
there
not
speaking
not
raising
his
eyes
a
condemned
creature
mary
and
helen
and
hamlet
had
had
a
wretched
day
they
all
sympathised
with
him
the
girls
went
to
dress
seven
struck
they
were
taken
downstairs
by
nurse
who
had
her
evening
out
rose
the
housemaid
would
sit
with
master
jeremy
doors
closed
doors
opened
voices
echoed
were
heard
jeremy
and
hamlet
were
left
to
themselves
iii
the
last
door
had
closed
and
the
sudden
sense
that
everyone
had
gone
and
that
he
might
behave
now
as
he
pleased
removed
the
armour
in
which
all
day
he
had
encased
himself
he
raised
his
head
looked
about
the
deserted
nursery
and
then
with
the
sudden
consciousness
of
that
other
lighted
and
busied
place
where
whittington
was
pursuing
his
adventures
he
burst
into
tears
he
sobbed
his
head
down
upon
his
arms
and
his
body
squeezed
together
so
that
his
knees
were
close
to
his
nose
and
his
hair
in
his
boots
hamlet
restored
him
to
himself
instead
of
assisting
his
master
grief
as
a
sentimental
dog
would
have
done
by
sighing
or
sniffing
or
howling
he
yawned
stretched
himself
and
rolled
on
the
carpet
he
did
not
believe
in
giving
way
to
feelings
and
he
was
surprised
and
perhaps
disappointed
at
jeremy
lack
of
restraint
jeremy
felt
this
and
in
a
little
while
sobs
came
very
slowly
and
at
last
were
only
little
shudders
rather
pleasant
and
healthy
he
looked
about
him
rubbed
his
red
nose
with
a
hideously
dirty
handkerchief
and
felt
immensely
sleepy
no
he
would
not
cry
any
more
rose
would
shortly
appear
and
he
did
not
intend
to
cry
before
housemaids
nevertheless
his
desolation
was
supreme
he
was
a
liar
he
had
told
lies
before
but
they
had
not
been
discovered
and
so
they
were
scarcely
lies
now
in
some
strange
way
the
publication
of
his
lie
had
shown
him
what
truly
impossible
things
lies
were
he
had
witnessed
this
effect
upon
the
general
public
he
had
not
believed
that
he
was
so
wicked
he
did
not
even
now
feel
really
wicked
but
he
saw
quite
clearly
that
there
was
one
world
for
liars
and
one
for
truthful
men
he
wanted
terribly
badly
someone
to
tell
him
that
he
was
still
in
the
right
world
and
then
on
the
other
side
the
thought
that
mary
and
helen
were
at
this
very
moment
witnessing
the
coloured
history
of
dick
whittinglon
the
history
that
he
had
pursued
ceaselessly
during
all
these
days
and
nights
that
picture
of
them
all
in
the
lighted
theatre
once
more
nearly
overcame
him
but
he
pulled
himself
together
he
sniffed
left
his
dirty
handkerchief
and
went
slowly
and
sorrowfully
to
drag
out
his
toy
village
from
its
corner
and
see
whether
anything
could
be
done
with
it
after
all
he
was
going
to
school
in
september
his
punishment
could
not
be
quite
limitless
hamlet
had
just
shown
his
approval
of
this
manly
conduct
by
strolling
up
and
sniffing
at
the
noah
family
who
were
as
usual
on
their
way
to
church
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
in
came
uncle
samuel
jeremy
had
forgotten
his
uncle
and
now
blinked
up
at
him
from
the
floor
where
he
was
squatting
rather
ashamed
of
his
swollen
eyes
and
red
nose
uncle
samuel
however
had
no
time
for
details
he
was
apparently
in
a
hurry
he
did
not
wear
his
blue
but
was
in
a
comparatively
clean
black
suit
and
on
the
back
of
his
head
was
a
squashy
brown
hat
come
on
he
said
or
we
shall
be
too
jeremy
choked
too
late
he
repeated
you
coming
are
you
to
the
pantomime
they
sent
me
back
for
the
room
suddenly
got
on
to
its
legs
like
the
food
and
the
families
during
alice
feast
in
the
looking
glass
and
swung
round
lurching
from
side
to
side
and
causing
the
fire
to
run
into
the
gas
and
the
gas
to
fly
out
of
the
window
i
do
understand
jeremy
stammered
well
if
you
do
understand
in
half
a
shake
said
uncle
samuel
you
wo
see
any
of
the
show
at
all
go
on
wash
your
face
there
are
streaks
of
dirt
all
down
it
as
though
you
were
a
painted
indian
stick
on
your
cap
and
coat
and
boots
and
come
exactly
as
one
moves
in
sleep
so
jeremy
now
moved
he
had
once
had
a
wonderful
dream
in
which
he
had
been
at
a
meal
that
included
every
thing
that
he
had
most
loved
sausages
ices
strawberry
jam
chocolates
and
scrambled
eggs
and
he
had
been
able
to
eat
and
eat
and
had
never
been
satisfied
and
had
never
felt
sick
a
lovely
dream
he
often
thought
of
it
and
now
in
the
same
bewildering
fashion
he
found
his
boots
and
cap
and
coat
and
then
deliberately
keeping
from
him
the
thought
of
the
pantomime
lest
he
should
suddenly
wake
up
he
said
i
ready
samuel
trefusia
looked
at
him
you
a
strange
kid
he
said
you
take
everything
so
quietly
but
thank
god
i
do
understand
there
hamlet
said
jeremy
wondering
whether
perhaps
the
dream
would
extend
to
his
friend
i
suppose
he
ca
come
no
he
certainly
ca
said
uncle
samuel
grimly
and
there
rose
she
wonder
where
i
i
told
her
do
you
worry
what
a
conscientious
infant
you
are
just
like
your
father
anything
else
no
said
jeremy
breathlessly
and
nearly
murdered
himself
going
downstairs
because
he
shut
his
eyes
in
order
to
continue
the
dream
so
long
as
it
was
possible
then
in
the
cold
night
air
grasping
his
uncle
hand
with
a
feverish
hold
he
stammered
is
it
really
true
are
we
going
really
of
course
we
going
come
on
step
out
or
you
miss
the
but
but
oh
he
drew
a
deep
breath
then
they
do
think
me
a
liar
any
more
they
who
father
and
mother
and
do
you
think
about
them
you
better
enjoy
but
you
said
you
would
go
to
the
pantomime
not
for
anything
well
i
changed
my
mind
do
talk
so
much
you
know
i
hate
you
children
chattering
always
got
something
to
so
jeremy
was
silent
they
raced
down
orange
street
jeremy
being
almost
carried
off
his
feet
this
was
exactly
like
a
dream
this
rushing
movement
and
the
way
that
the
ran
up
to
you
as
though
they
were
going
to
knock
you
down
and
the
way
that
the
stars
crackled
and
sputtered
and
trembled
overhead
but
uncle
samuel
hand
was
flesh
and
blood
and
the
heel
of
jeremy
right
shoe
hurt
him
and
he
felt
the
tickle
of
his
at
the
back
of
his
neck
just
as
he
did
when
he
was
awake
then
there
they
were
at
the
assembly
rooms
door
jeremy
having
become
so
breathless
that
uncle
samuel
had
to
hold
him
up
for
a
moment
or
have
fallen
bit
too
fast
for
you
was
it
well
you
should
be
so
fat
you
eat
too
much
now
we
not
going
to
sit
with
your
father
and
mother
there
is
room
for
you
there
so
do
you
go
calling
out
to
them
or
anything
we
sitting
in
the
back
and
you
better
be
quiet
or
turn
you
i
be
quiet
gasped
jeremy
uncle
samuel
paused
at
a
lighted
hole
in
the
wall
and
spoke
to
a
large
lady
in
black
silk
who
was
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
jeremy
caught
the
jingle
of
money
then
they
moved
forward
stumbling
in
the
dark
up
a
number
of
stone
steps
pushing
at
a
heavy
black
curtain
then
suddenly
bathed
in
a
bewildering
glow
of
light
and
scent
and
colour
jeremy
first
impression
as
he
fell
into
this
new
world
was
of
an
ugly
harsh
but
funny
voice
crying
out
very
loudly
indeed
oh
my
great
aunt
oh
my
great
aunt
oh
my
great
aunt
a
roar
of
laughter
rose
about
him
almost
lifting
him
off
his
feet
and
close
to
his
car
a
glebeshire
voice
sobbed
eh
my
dear
poor
worm
poor
worm
he
was
aware
then
of
a
strong
smell
of
oranges
of
uncle
samuel
pushing
him
forward
of
stumbling
over
boots
knees
and
large
hands
that
were
clapping
in
his
very
nose
of
falling
into
a
seat
and
then
clinging
to
it
as
though
it
was
his
only
hope
in
this
strange
puzzling
world
the
high
funny
voice
rose
again
oh
my
great
aunt
oh
my
great
aunt
and
again
it
was
followed
by
the
rough
roar
of
delighted
laughter
he
was
aware
then
that
about
him
on
every
side
gas
was
sizzling
and
then
as
he
recovered
slowly
his
breath
his
gaze
was
drawn
to
the
great
blaze
of
light
in
the
distance
against
which
figures
were
dimly
moving
and
from
the
heart
of
which
the
strange
voice
came
he
heard
a
voice
then
several
voices
together
then
suddenly
the
whole
scene
shifted
into
focus
his
eyes
were
tied
to
the
light
the
oranges
and
the
gas
and
the
smell
of
clothes
and
heated
bodies
slipped
back
into
distance
he
was
caught
into
the
world
where
he
had
longed
to
be
he
saw
that
it
was
a
shop
and
he
loved
shops
his
heart
beat
thickly
as
his
eyes
travelled
up
and
up
and
up
over
the
rows
and
rows
of
shelves
here
were
bales
of
cloth
red
and
green
and
blue
carpets
from
the
east
sheets
and
blankets
behind
the
long
yellow
counters
young
men
in
strange
clothes
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
scene
was
a
funny
old
woman
her
hat
tumbling
off
her
head
her
shabby
skirt
dragging
large
boots
and
a
red
nose
it
was
from
this
strange
creature
that
the
deep
ugly
voice
proceeded
she
had
this
old
woman
a
number
of
bales
of
cloth
under
her
arms
and
she
tried
to
carry
them
all
but
one
slipped
and
then
another
and
then
another
she
bent
to
pick
them
up
and
her
hat
fell
off
she
turned
for
her
hat
and
all
the
bales
tumbled
together
jeremy
began
to
laugh
everyone
laughed
the
strange
voice
came
again
and
again
lamenting
bewailing
she
had
secured
one
bale
a
smile
of
cautious
triumph
began
to
spread
over
her
ugly
face
then
the
bales
all
fell
again
and
once
more
she
was
on
her
knees
it
was
then
that
her
voice
or
some
movement
brought
to
jeremy
eyes
so
vividly
the
figure
of
their
old
gardener
jordan
that
he
turned
round
to
uncle
samuel
and
suddenly
grasping
that
gentleman
fat
thigh
exclaimed
convulsively
why
she
a
man
what
a
strange
world
this
was
in
which
women
were
men
and
shops
turned
as
with
a
sudden
creaking
and
darkness
and
clattering
did
this
one
into
gardens
by
the
sea
jeremy
drew
his
breath
deeply
and
held
on
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
hair
on
it
is
impossible
to
define
exactly
jeremy
ultimate
impression
as
the
entertainment
proceeded
perhaps
he
had
no
ultimate
impression
it
can
not
in
reality
have
been
a
very
wonderful
pantomime
even
at
drury
lane
thirty
years
back
there
were
many
things
that
they
did
not
know
and
it
is
not
likely
that
a
touring
company
fitted
into
so
inadequate
an
old
building
as
our
assembly
rooms
would
have
provided
anything
very
fine
but
jeremy
will
never
again
discover
so
complete
a
realisation
for
his
illusions
whatever
failures
in
the
presentation
there
were
he
himself
made
good
as
a
finale
to
the
first
half
of
the
entertainment
there
was
given
dick
dream
at
the
he
lay
on
the
hard
ground
his
head
upon
his
bundle
the
cat
as
large
as
he
watching
sympathetically
beside
him
in
the
distance
were
the
lights
of
london
and
then
out
of
the
half
dusk
fairies
glittering
with
stars
and
silver
danced
up
and
down
the
dusky
road
whilst
all
the
london
bells
rang
out
turn
again
whittington
lord
mayor
of
had
jeremy
been
of
the
age
and
wisdom
of
uncle
samuel
he
would
have
discovered
that
dick
was
a
stout
lady
and
probably
the
mother
of
a
growing
family
that
the
fairies
knew
as
much
about
dancing
as
the
glebeshire
wives
sitting
on
the
bench
behind
that
the
london
bells
were
two
hand
instruments
worked
by
a
youth
in
shirt
sleeves
behind
the
scenes
so
energetically
that
the
high
road
and
the
painted
london
blew
backwards
and
forwards
in
sympathy
with
his
movements
jeremy
happily
was
not
so
worldly
wise
as
his
uncle
this
scene
created
for
him
then
a
tradition
of
imperishable
beauty
that
would
never
fade
again
the
world
after
that
night
would
be
a
more
magical
place
than
it
had
ever
been
before
turn
again
whittington
continued
the
education
that
the
toy
village
and
hamlet
had
already
advanced
when
the
gas
rose
once
again
sizzling
like
crackling
bacon
he
was
white
with
excitement
the
only
remark
that
he
made
was
it
much
better
than
the
pictures
outside
martin
is
it
uncle
samuel
to
which
uncle
samuel
who
had
been
railing
for
weeks
at
the
deflowering
of
polchester
by
those
abominable
posters
could
truthfully
reply
much
little
by
little
he
withdrew
himself
from
the
other
world
and
realised
his
own
he
could
see
that
he
and
his
uncle
were
certainly
not
amongst
the
quality
large
ladies
their
dresses
tucked
up
over
their
knees
sucked
oranges
country
farmers
with
huge
knobbly
looking
sticks
were
there
and
even
some
sailors
on
their
way
probably
to
drymouth
he
recognised
the
lady
who
kept
charge
of
the
small
orange
street
and
waved
to
her
with
delighted
excitement
the
atmosphere
was
thick
with
gas
and
oranges
and
i
afraid
that
uncle
samuel
must
have
suffered
a
great
deal
i
can
only
put
it
on
record
that
he
the
most
selfish
of
human
beings
never
breathed
a
word
of
complaint
they
were
all
packed
very
closely
together
up
there
in
the
gallery
where
seventy
years
before
an
orchestra
straight
from
jane
novels
had
played
to
the
dancing
of
the
contemporaries
of
elizabeth
bennett
emma
woodhouse
and
the
dear
lady
of
another
years
and
that
same
gallery
would
be
listening
to
recruiting
appeals
and
echoing
the
drums
and
fifes
of
a
martial
band
the
best
times
are
always
the
old
times
the
huge
lady
in
the
seat
next
to
jeremy
almost
swallowed
him
up
so
that
he
peered
out
from
under
her
thick
arm
and
heard
every
crunch
and
crackle
of
the
peppermints
that
she
was
enjoying
he
grew
hotter
and
hotter
so
that
at
last
he
seemed
as
once
he
had
read
in
some
warning
tract
about
a
greedy
boy
that
aunt
amy
had
given
him
to
swim
in
his
own
but
he
did
not
mind
discomfort
only
emphasised
his
happiness
then
peering
forward
beneath
that
stout
black
arm
he
suddenly
perceived
far
below
in
the
swimming
distance
the
back
of
his
mother
the
tops
of
the
heads
of
mary
and
helen
the
stiff
white
collar
of
his
father
and
the
coral
necklace
of
aunt
amy
for
a
moment
dismay
seized
him
the
morning
lie
which
he
had
entirely
forgotten
suddenly
jumping
up
and
facing
him
but
they
had
forgiven
him
shall
i
wave
to
them
he
asked
excitedly
of
uncle
samuel
no
no
said
his
uncle
very
hurriedly
nonsense
they
would
see
you
if
you
did
leave
them
he
felt
immensely
superior
to
them
up
where
he
was
and
he
have
changed
places
with
them
for
anything
he
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
i
could
drop
an
orange
on
to
aunt
amy
head
he
said
would
she
jump
you
must
keep
quiet
said
uncle
samuel
you
good
enough
as
you
i
rather
be
here
said
jeremy
it
beautifully
hot
here
and
there
a
lovely
there
is
said
uncle
samuel
then
the
gas
went
down
and
the
curtain
went
up
and
dick
now
in
a
suit
of
red
silk
with
golden
buttons
continued
his
adventures
i
have
not
space
here
to
describe
in
detail
the
further
events
of
his
life
how
receiving
a
telegram
from
the
king
of
the
zanzibars
about
the
plague
of
rats
he
took
ship
with
his
cat
and
alderman
fitzwarren
and
his
wife
how
they
were
all
swallowed
by
a
whale
cast
up
by
a
most
lucky
chance
on
the
zanzibars
nearly
cooked
by
the
natives
and
rescued
by
the
king
of
the
zanzibars
beautiful
daughter
killed
all
the
rats
were
given
a
huge
feast
with
dance
and
song
and
finally
dick
although
tempted
by
the
dusky
princess
refused
a
large
fortune
and
returned
to
alice
of
eastcheap
the
true
lady
of
his
heart
there
were
of
course
many
other
things
such
as
the
aspirations
and
misadventures
of
fitzwarren
the
lady
who
had
already
so
greatly
amused
jeremy
and
then
there
was
a
transformation
scene
in
which
roses
turned
into
tulips
and
tulips
into
the
hall
of
gold
down
whose
blazing
steps
marched
stout
representatives
of
all
the
nations
it
was
in
the
middle
of
this
last
thrilling
spectacle
when
heart
was
in
his
mouth
and
he
was
so
deeply
excited
that
he
did
not
know
whether
it
were
he
or
the
lady
next
to
him
who
was
eating
peppermints
that
his
uncle
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
and
said
in
his
ear
come
on
it
close
on
the
end
we
must
jeremy
very
reluctantly
got
up
and
stumbled
out
over
knees
and
legs
and
exclamations
like
there
japan
no
it
ai
it
chiney
you
a
fine
hearty
young
woman
and
so
on
he
was
dragged
through
the
black
curtain
down
the
stone
steps
and
into
the
street
but
it
was
the
end
he
said
it
will
be
in
one
minute
said
his
uncle
and
i
want
us
to
get
home
why
said
jeremy
never
you
mind
come
on
we
race
they
arrived
home
breathless
and
then
once
again
in
the
old
familiar
hall
uncle
samuel
said
now
you
nip
up
to
the
nursery
and
then
they
never
know
you
been
out
at
never
know
said
jeremy
but
you
said
they
sent
for
well
said
uncle
samuel
that
was
exactly
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
know
you
were
oh
said
jeremy
the
corner
of
his
mouth
turning
down
then
i
told
a
lie
again
nonsense
said
uncle
samuel
impatiently
it
was
you
it
was
and
does
it
matter
your
telling
lies
asked
jeremy
the
answer
to
this
difficult
question
was
happily
for
uncle
samuel
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
household
who
had
careened
up
orange
street
in
a
cab
when
and
cole
saw
jeremy
standing
in
the
hall
his
great
coat
still
on
and
his
muffler
round
his
neck
there
was
a
fine
scene
of
wonder
and
amazement
uncle
samuel
explained
it
was
my
fault
i
told
him
you
forgiven
him
and
sent
for
him
to
come
after
all
he
in
an
awful
state
now
that
you
should
forgive
whatever
they
thought
of
uncle
samuel
this
was
obviously
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
speak
out
cole
looked
at
her
son
his
body
defiant
sleepy
excited
his
mouth
was
obstinate
but
his
eyes
appealed
to
her
on
the
scene
of
the
common
marvellous
experience
that
they
had
just
enjoyed
she
hugged
him
and
you
wo
tell
a
lie
again
will
you
jeremy
dear
oh
no
and
then
hurrying
on
and
when
the
old
woman
tumbled
down
the
steps
mother
was
it
lovely
and
the
fairies
in
dick
whittington
sleep
and
when
the
furniture
all
fell
all
over
the
place
he
went
slowly
upstairs
to
the
nursery
the
happiest
boy
in
the
kingdom
but
through
all
his
happiness
there
was
this
puzzle
uncle
samuel
had
told
a
lie
and
no
one
had
thought
that
it
mattered
there
were
good
lies
and
bad
ones
then
or
was
it
that
people
could
tell
lies
and
children
must
he
tumbled
into
the
warm
lighted
nursery
half
asleep
there
was
hamlet
watching
in
front
of
the
jampot
sewing
machine
he
would
have
things
to
think
about
for
years
and
years
and
years
there
was
the
jampot
i
sorry
i
called
you
a
beastly
woman
he
said
she
sniffed
well
i
hope
you
be
a
good
boy
now
she
said
oh
i
be
good
he
smiled
but
nurse
are
there
some
people
can
tell
lies
and
others
must
all
them
that
tell
lies
goes
to
hell
said
the
jampot
and
now
master
jeremy
come
along
and
take
your
things
off
it
past
eleven
and
what
you
be
like
chapter
iv
miss
jones
i
the
coming
of
the
new
year
meant
the
going
of
the
jampot
and
the
going
of
the
jampot
meant
the
breaking
of
a
traditions
the
departure
was
depressing
and
unsettling
the
weather
was
as
it
always
is
during
january
in
glebeshire
at
its
worst
and
the
jampot
feeling
it
all
very
deeply
maintained
a
terrible
spartan
composure
which
was
meant
to
show
indifference
and
a
sense
of
injustice
she
had
to
the
very
last
believed
it
incredible
that
she
should
really
go
she
had
been
in
the
old
orange
street
house
for
eight
years
and
had
intended
to
be
there
until
she
died
she
was
forced
to
admit
that
master
jeremy
was
going
beyond
her
but
in
september
he
would
go
to
school
and
then
she
could
help
with
the
sewing
and
other
things
about
the
house
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
she
had
never
been
a
very
good
servant
having
too
much
of
the
glebeshire
pride
and
independence
and
too
little
of
the
glebeshire
fidelity
cole
had
been
glad
of
the
opportunity
that
hamlet
arrival
in
the
family
had
given
her
the
jampot
only
a
week
before
the
date
of
her
departure
came
to
her
mistress
and
begged
with
floods
of
tears
to
be
allowed
to
continue
in
her
service
but
cole
with
all
her
placidity
was
firm
the
jampot
had
to
go
i
would
like
to
paint
a
pleasant
picture
of
the
sentiment
of
the
cole
children
on
this
touching
occasion
something
perhaps
in
the
vein
of
with
which
kenneth
graham
embroiders
a
similar
occasion
in
his
famous
masterpiece
but
in
this
case
there
was
very
little
sentiment
and
no
tragedy
at
all
they
did
not
think
of
the
event
beforehand
and
then
when
it
suddenly
occurred
there
was
all
the
excitement
of
being
looked
after
by
rose
the
housemaid
of
having
a
longer
time
with
their
mother
in
the
evening
and
best
of
all
a
delightful
walk
with
aunt
amy
whose
virginal
peace
of
mind
they
attacked
from
every
possible
quarter
the
jampot
left
in
a
high
state
of
sulks
declaring
to
the
kitchen
that
no
woman
had
ever
been
so
unfairly
treated
that
her
married
sister
sarah
francis
of
rafiel
with
whom
she
was
now
to
live
should
be
told
all
about
it
and
that
the
citizens
of
rafiel
should
be
compelled
to
sympathise
the
children
were
not
unfeeling
but
they
hated
the
sulks
and
while
she
waited
in
the
nursery
longing
for
a
word
or
movement
of
affection
but
wearing
a
face
of
stony
disapproval
they
stood
awkwardly
beholding
her
and
aching
for
her
to
go
she
was
the
more
unapproachable
in
that
she
wore
her
sunday
silks
and
a
heavy
black
bonnet
with
shiny
rattling
globes
of
some
dark
metal
that
nodded
and
becked
and
bowed
like
live
things
hamlet
who
had
of
course
always
hated
the
jampot
barked
at
this
bonnet
furiously
and
would
have
bitten
at
it
had
it
been
within
his
reach
she
had
meant
to
leave
them
all
with
little
sentences
about
life
and
morals
but
the
noise
of
the
dog
the
indifference
of
the
children
and
the
general
air
of
impatience
for
her
departure
strangled
her
aphorisms
poor
jampot
she
was
departing
to
a
married
sister
who
did
not
want
her
and
would
often
tell
her
so
her
prospects
in
life
were
not
bright
and
it
is
sad
to
think
that
no
inhabitant
of
the
orange
street
house
felt
any
sorrow
at
the
sight
of
the
last
gesticulating
wave
of
her
black
bonnet
as
she
stepped
into
the
old
mouldy
polchester
cab
the
king
is
dead
long
live
the
king
the
jampot
as
a
power
in
the
cole
family
has
ceased
to
be
the
day
following
the
jampot
departure
offered
up
the
news
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
coles
there
was
to
be
a
governess
the
word
governess
had
an
awful
sound
and
the
children
trembled
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
terror
jeremy
pretended
indifference
it
only
another
woman
he
said
she
be
like
the
jampot
only
a
lady
so
she
wo
be
able
to
punish
us
as
the
jampot
i
expect
that
and
cole
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
anyone
who
would
do
thirty
years
ago
governesses
were
an
incapable
race
and
belonged
too
closely
either
to
the
becky
sharp
or
the
amelia
type
to
be
very
satisfactory
it
was
then
that
the
new
woman
was
bursting
upon
the
scene
but
she
was
not
to
be
found
amongst
the
governesses
no
one
in
polchester
had
learnt
yet
to
cycle
in
rational
costume
it
was
several
years
before
the
publication
of
the
heavenly
twins
and
lilys
and
lucys
were
still
considered
the
ideal
of
england
maidenhood
cole
therefore
had
to
choose
between
idiotic
young
women
and
crabbed
old
maids
and
she
finally
chose
an
old
maid
i
do
think
that
miss
jones
was
the
very
best
choice
that
she
could
have
made
but
time
was
short
jeremy
aided
by
hamlet
was
growing
terribly
independent
and
cole
had
neither
the
humour
nor
the
courage
to
deal
with
him
no
miss
jones
was
not
ideal
but
the
dean
had
strongly
recommended
her
it
is
true
that
the
dean
had
never
seen
her
but
her
brother
with
whom
she
had
lived
for
many
years
had
once
been
the
dean
curate
it
was
true
that
he
had
been
a
failure
as
a
curate
but
that
made
the
dean
the
more
anxious
to
be
kind
now
to
his
memory
he
jones
having
just
died
of
general
and
selfishness
miss
jones
buried
during
the
last
twenty
years
in
the
green
depths
of
a
glebeshire
valley
found
herself
now
at
the
age
of
fifty
without
friends
without
money
without
relations
she
thought
that
she
would
be
a
governess
the
dean
recommended
her
cole
approved
of
her
birth
education
and
sobriety
cole
liked
the
severity
of
her
countenance
when
she
came
to
call
and
she
was
engaged
jeremy
needs
a
tight
hand
said
cole
it
no
use
having
a
young
miss
jones
easily
escapes
that
charge
said
uncle
samuel
who
had
met
her
in
the
hall
the
children
were
prepared
to
be
good
jeremy
felt
that
it
was
time
to
take
life
seriously
he
put
away
his
toy
village
scolded
hamlet
for
eating
mary
pincushion
and
dragged
out
his
dirty
in
which
he
did
sums
i
do
hate
sums
he
said
with
a
sigh
regarding
the
hideous
smudges
of
thumbs
and
tears
that
scored
the
page
i
shall
never
understand
anything
about
i
help
you
said
mary
who
was
greatly
excited
at
the
thought
of
a
governess
we
do
them
no
we
wo
said
jeremy
who
hated
to
be
dependent
i
learn
it
myself
if
only
the
paper
did
get
dirty
so
mother
says
remarked
helen
that
she
had
a
very
hard
life
and
no
one
ever
been
kind
to
her
wants
affection
mother
i
give
her
my
that
you
gave
me
last
christmas
mary
said
jeremy
you
do
mind
do
you
it
all
dirty
now
i
hope
hamlet
wo
bark
at
hamlet
was
worrying
mary
pincushion
at
the
moment
holding
it
between
his
paws
his
body
stretched
out
in
quivering
excitement
his
short
snappy
tail
as
uncle
samuel
called
it
standing
up
straight
in
air
he
stopped
for
an
instant
when
he
heard
his
name
and
shook
one
ear
mother
says
continued
helen
that
she
lived
with
a
brother
who
never
gave
her
enough
to
jeremy
opened
his
eyes
this
seemed
to
him
a
horrible
thing
she
shall
have
my
porridge
if
she
likes
he
said
i
do
like
it
very
much
and
i
give
her
that
chocolate
that
jellybrand
sent
us
there
still
some
although
it
rather
damp
now
i
how
silly
you
are
said
helen
scornfully
of
course
mother
will
give
her
anything
she
it
is
silly
said
jeremy
perhaps
she
want
more
than
she
really
wants
i
often
oh
you
said
helen
and
if
for
ever
so
long
said
jeremy
she
has
had
enough
to
eat
she
want
twice
as
big
meals
now
as
other
people
to
make
mother
says
we
got
to
remember
she
a
lady
said
helen
what
the
difference
asked
jeremy
between
a
lady
and
not
a
lady
oh
you
are
said
helen
why
aunt
amy
a
lady
and
rose
rose
is
nicer
said
jeremy
miss
jones
had
i
am
sorry
to
say
lied
to
cole
in
one
particular
she
had
told
her
that
she
had
had
to
do
with
children
all
her
life
the
fact
being
that
on
several
occasions
some
little
cousins
had
come
to
stay
with
herself
and
her
brother
on
these
occasions
the
little
cousins
had
been
so
paralysed
with
terror
that
discipline
had
not
been
difficult
it
was
from
these
experiences
that
miss
jones
flattered
herself
that
she
understood
so
audacious
a
is
doomed
to
invite
the
scornful
punishment
of
the
gods
miss
jones
arrived
upon
a
wet
january
afternoon
one
of
those
glebeshire
days
when
the
town
sinks
into
a
bath
of
mud
and
mist
and
all
the
pipes
run
water
and
the
eaves
drip
and
horses
splash
and
only
ducks
are
happy
out
of
a
blurred
dusk
stumbled
miss
jones
cab
and
out
of
a
blurred
unlit
cab
stumbled
miss
jones
as
she
stood
in
the
hall
trying
to
look
warm
and
amiable
heart
forsook
her
on
that
earlier
day
of
her
visit
miss
jones
had
looked
possible
sitting
up
in
cole
smiling
her
brightest
because
she
so
desperately
needed
the
situation
and
wearing
her
best
dress
now
she
was
all
in
pieces
she
had
had
to
leave
her
little
village
early
in
the
morning
to
catch
the
village
bus
she
had
waited
at
wayside
stations
as
in
glebeshire
only
one
can
wait
the
world
had
dripped
upon
her
head
and
spattered
upon
her
legs
she
had
neuralgia
and
a
pain
in
her
back
she
had
worn
her
older
dress
because
upon
such
a
day
it
would
not
do
to
travel
in
her
best
and
then
as
a
climax
to
everything
she
had
left
her
umbrella
in
the
train
how
she
could
do
such
a
thing
upon
such
a
day
her
memory
was
not
her
strongest
point
poor
lady
and
it
was
a
good
umbrella
and
she
could
not
afford
to
buy
another
perhaps
they
would
find
it
for
her
but
it
was
very
unlikely
she
had
had
it
for
a
number
of
years
she
was
a
little
woman
all
skin
and
bone
with
dried
withered
cheeks
a
large
brown
nose
and
protruding
ears
her
face
had
formed
severe
lines
in
against
her
brother
but
her
eyes
were
mild
and
when
she
smiled
her
mouth
was
rather
pleasantly
pathetic
oh
she
never
do
thought
cole
as
she
looked
at
her
dripping
in
the
hall
i
ca
think
how
i
forgot
it
said
the
poor
lady
her
mind
fixed
upon
her
umbrella
they
said
that
perhaps
they
would
find
it
for
me
but
there
was
a
man
in
my
carriage
i
remember
who
will
most
certainly
have
taken
it
and
it
was
a
nice
one
with
a
silver
never
mind
said
cole
cheerfully
i
sure
they
find
it
you
must
come
up
to
the
nursery
or
the
schoolroom
i
suppose
we
must
call
it
now
there
a
lovely
fire
there
and
we
both
have
tea
with
the
children
so
as
to
feel
at
home
all
of
us
as
quickly
as
what
miss
jones
wanted
was
to
lie
down
on
a
bed
in
a
dark
room
and
try
and
conquer
her
neuralgia
the
thought
of
a
lighted
nursery
filled
her
with
dismay
however
first
impressions
are
so
important
she
pulled
herself
together
the
children
had
heard
the
arrival
they
waited
in
a
bunch
by
the
fire
their
eyes
partly
fixed
on
the
door
partly
on
the
strawberry
jam
that
they
were
allowed
as
a
treat
in
the
new
governess
honour
hamlet
his
eyes
and
ears
also
upon
the
door
expecting
perhaps
a
rat
perhaps
aunt
amy
sat
in
front
of
the
group
its
bodyguard
she
in
the
hall
said
helen
and
now
mother
saying
take
off
your
things
you
must
be
wet
and
now
she
saying
like
to
see
the
children
i
expect
and
now
there
they
were
standing
in
the
doorway
cole
and
miss
jones
there
followed
a
dismal
pause
the
children
had
not
expected
anyone
so
old
and
so
ugly
as
miss
jones
hamlet
did
not
bark
nothing
occurred
at
last
cole
said
now
children
come
and
say
do
you
do
to
miss
jones
this
is
helen
our
eldest
this
mary
and
this
miss
jones
did
a
dreadful
thing
in
her
eagerness
to
be
pleasant
and
friendly
she
kissed
the
girls
and
then
before
anyone
could
stop
her
kissed
jeremy
he
took
it
like
a
man
never
turning
his
head
nor
wiping
his
mouth
with
his
hand
afterwards
but
she
might
have
seen
in
his
eyes
had
she
looked
what
he
felt
about
it
she
said
i
hope
we
shall
be
happy
together
the
children
said
nothing
and
presently
they
all
sat
down
to
tea
ii
it
was
unfortunate
that
there
was
so
little
precedent
on
both
sides
miss
jones
had
never
been
a
governess
before
and
the
children
had
never
had
one
of
course
many
mistakes
were
made
miss
jones
had
had
a
true
admiration
for
what
she
used
to
call
her
brother
indomitable
spirit
her
name
for
his
selfishness
and
bad
temper
she
was
herself
neither
selfish
nor
but
she
was
ignorant
nervous
and
desperately
afraid
of
losing
her
situation
she
had
during
so
many
years
lived
without
affection
that
the
wells
of
it
had
dried
up
within
her
and
now
without
being
at
all
a
bad
old
lady
she
was
simply
preoccupied
with
the
business
of
managing
her
neuralgia
living
on
nothing
a
week
and
building
to
her
deceased
brother
memory
a
monument
of
heroic
character
and
she
was
and
had
a
perpetual
cold
she
was
forgetful
and
careless
she
had
nevertheless
a
real
knowledge
of
many
things
a
warm
heart
somewhere
could
she
be
encouraged
to
look
for
it
again
and
a
sense
of
humour
buried
deep
beneath
her
cares
and
preoccupations
there
were
many
worse
persons
in
the
world
than
miss
jones
but
most
unfortunately
her
love
for
her
brother
memory
led
her
to
resolve
on
what
she
called
cole
had
told
her
that
jeremy
was
getting
too
much
for
his
nurse
she
approached
jeremy
with
exactly
the
tremors
and
quaking
boldness
that
she
would
have
summoned
to
her
aid
before
a
bull
loose
in
a
field
she
really
did
look
frightening
with
her
large
spectacles
on
the
end
of
her
large
nose
her
mouth
firmly
set
and
a
ruler
in
her
hand
i
insist
on
absolute
obedience
was
her
motto
jeremy
looked
at
her
but
said
no
word
it
was
made
clear
to
them
all
that
the
new
regime
was
to
be
far
other
than
the
earlier
nursery
one
there
were
to
be
regular
lesson
hours
nine
to
twelve
and
four
to
five
a
neat
piece
of
white
paper
was
fastened
to
the
wall
with
monday
geography
arithmetic
and
so
on
a
careful
graduation
of
punishments
was
instituted
copies
to
be
written
so
many
times
standing
on
a
chair
three
strokes
on
the
hand
with
a
ruler
and
worst
of
all
standing
in
the
corner
wearing
a
paper
dunce
cap
this
last
she
had
read
of
in
books
at
first
jeremy
had
every
intention
of
behaving
well
in
spite
of
that
unfortunate
embrace
he
was
proud
of
his
advance
in
life
he
was
no
longer
a
baby
the
nursery
was
now
a
schoolroom
he
stayed
up
an
hour
later
at
night
he
was
to
be
allowed
twopence
a
week
his
whole
social
status
had
risen
he
began
to
read
for
pleasure
and
discovered
that
it
was
easier
than
he
had
expected
so
that
he
passed
quite
quickly
through
lottie
visit
to
grandmama
into
stumps
and
out
again
in
he
heard
some
elder
say
that
the
road
to
a
large
fortune
lay
through
sums
and
although
this
seemed
to
him
an
extremely
mysterious
statement
he
determined
to
give
the
theory
a
chance
in
fact
he
sat
down
the
first
day
at
the
schoolroom
table
mary
and
helen
on
each
side
of
him
and
miss
jones
facing
them
with
fine
resolves
and
high
ambitions
before
him
lay
a
pure
white
page
and
at
the
head
of
this
the
noble
words
in
a
running
hand
slow
and
steady
wins
the
he
grasped
his
pencil
and
miss
jones
eager
to
lose
no
time
in
asserting
her
authority
cried
but
that
not
the
way
to
hold
your
pencil
jeremy
your
thumb
so
your
finger
he
scowled
and
found
that
lifting
his
thumb
over
the
pencil
was
as
difficult
as
lifting
hamlet
over
a
gate
he
made
a
bold
attempt
but
the
pencil
refused
to
move
ca
hold
it
that
way
he
said
you
must
never
say
jeremy
remarked
miss
jones
there
such
a
oh
yes
said
mary
eagerly
there
is
i
seen
it
in
you
mus
contradict
mary
said
miss
jones
i
only
meant
that
you
must
behave
as
though
there
is
because
nothing
is
impossible
to
one
who
truly
my
pencil
waggles
this
way
said
jeremy
politely
i
think
i
hold
it
the
old
way
there
only
one
way
of
doing
anything
said
miss
jones
and
the
right
this
is
the
right
way
for
me
said
jeremy
if
i
say
it
not
the
right
way
but
it
waggles
cried
jeremy
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
from
helen
oh
do
look
miss
jones
hamlet
got
your
he
thinks
it
a
there
followed
general
confusion
miss
jones
jumped
up
and
with
little
cries
of
distress
pursued
hamlet
who
hastened
into
his
favourite
corner
and
began
to
worry
the
with
one
eye
on
miss
jones
and
one
on
his
spoils
jeremy
hurried
up
crying
put
it
down
hamlet
naughty
dog
naughty
dog
and
mary
and
helen
laughed
with
frantic
delight
at
last
miss
jones
her
face
red
and
her
hair
in
disorder
rescued
her
property
and
returned
to
the
table
hamlet
meanwhile
wagging
his
tail
panting
and
watching
for
a
further
game
i
ca
possibly
said
miss
jones
allow
that
dog
in
here
during
lesson
hours
it
oh
but
miss
jones
began
jeremy
not
one
word
said
she
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
lead
him
from
the
room
jeremy
but
miss
jones
he
must
be
here
he
learning
too
in
a
day
or
two
he
be
as
good
as
anything
really
he
will
he
so
intelligent
he
really
thought
it
was
his
to
play
with
and
he
did
give
it
up
he
as
soon
as
i
said
enough
said
miss
jones
i
will
listen
to
no
more
i
say
he
is
not
to
remain
but
if
i
promise
said
jeremy
then
miss
jones
made
a
bad
mistake
wearied
of
the
argument
wishing
to
continue
the
lesson
and
hoping
perhaps
to
please
her
tormentors
she
said
meekly
well
if
he
really
is
good
perhaps
from
that
instant
her
doom
was
sealed
the
children
exchanged
a
glance
of
realisation
jeremy
smiled
the
lesson
was
continued
what
possessed
jeremy
now
what
possesses
any
child
naturally
perhaps
of
a
kindly
and
even
sentimental
nature
at
the
sight
of
something
helpless
and
in
its
power
is
there
any
cruelty
in
after
life
like
the
cruelty
of
a
small
boy
and
is
there
anything
more
powerful
more
unreasoning
and
more
malicious
than
the
calculating
tortures
that
small
children
devise
for
those
weaker
than
themselves
jeremy
was
possessed
with
a
new
power
it
was
something
almost
abstract
in
its
manifestations
it
was
something
indecent
sinister
secret
foreign
to
his
whole
nature
felt
by
him
now
for
the
first
time
unanalysed
of
course
but
belonging
had
he
known
it
to
that
world
of
which
afterwards
he
was
often
to
catch
glimpses
that
world
of
shining
white
faces
in
dark
streets
of
muffled
cries
from
shuttered
windows
of
muttered
exclamations
half
caught
half
understood
he
was
never
again
to
be
quite
free
from
the
neighbourhood
of
that
he
would
never
be
quite
sure
of
his
dominance
of
it
until
he
died
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
this
power
before
with
the
jampot
his
relations
had
been
quite
simple
he
had
been
rebellious
naughty
disobedient
and
had
been
punished
and
there
was
an
end
now
there
was
a
game
like
tracking
red
indians
in
the
prairie
or
tigers
in
the
jungle
he
watched
miss
jones
and
discovered
many
things
about
her
he
discovered
that
when
she
made
mistakes
in
the
things
that
she
taught
them
she
was
afraid
to
confess
to
her
mistakes
and
so
made
them
worse
and
worse
he
discovered
that
she
was
very
nervous
and
that
a
sudden
noise
made
her
jump
and
turn
white
and
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
he
discovered
that
she
would
punish
him
and
then
try
to
please
him
by
saying
he
need
not
finish
his
punishment
he
discovered
that
she
would
lose
things
like
her
spectacles
her
handkerchief
or
her
purse
and
then
be
afraid
to
confess
that
she
had
lost
them
and
endeavour
to
proceed
without
them
he
discovered
that
she
hated
to
hit
him
on
the
hand
with
a
ruler
he
scarcely
felt
the
strokes
he
discovered
that
when
his
mother
or
father
was
in
the
room
she
was
terrified
lest
he
should
misbehave
he
discovered
that
she
was
despised
by
the
servants
who
quite
openly
insulted
her
all
these
things
fed
his
sense
of
power
he
did
not
consider
her
a
human
being
at
all
she
was
simply
something
upon
which
he
could
exercise
his
ingenuity
and
cleverness
mary
followed
him
in
whatever
he
did
helen
pretended
to
be
superior
but
was
not
yes
miss
jones
was
in
the
hands
of
her
tormentors
and
there
was
no
escape
for
her
surely
it
must
have
been
some
outside
power
that
drove
jeremy
on
the
children
called
it
teasing
miss
jones
and
the
aboriginal
savagery
in
their
behaviour
was
as
unconscious
as
their
daily
speech
or
fashion
of
eating
their
food
some
instinct
inherited
perhaps
from
the
days
when
the
gentleman
with
the
biggest
muscles
extracted
for
his
daily
amusement
the
teeth
and
nails
of
his
less
happily
muscular
friends
there
were
many
games
to
be
played
with
miss
jones
she
always
began
her
morning
with
a
fine
show
of
authority
accumulated
perhaps
during
hours
of
spartan
resolution
whilst
the
rest
of
the
household
slept
i
see
that
they
do
what
i
tell
them
now
children
she
would
say
i
determined
to
stand
no
nonsense
this
morning
get
out
your
copy
five
minutes
later
would
begin
oh
miss
jones
i
ca
write
with
this
pencil
may
i
find
a
better
one
granted
permission
mary
head
and
large
spectacles
would
disappear
inside
the
schoolroom
cupboard
soon
jeremy
would
say
very
politely
miss
jones
i
think
i
know
where
it
is
may
i
help
her
to
find
it
then
jeremy
head
would
disappear
there
would
follow
giggles
whispers
again
giggles
then
from
the
cupboard
a
book
tumbles
then
another
then
another
then
miss
jones
would
say
now
jeremy
come
back
to
the
table
you
had
quite
enough
time
interrupted
by
a
perfect
avalanche
of
books
mary
crying
oh
jeremy
jeremy
crying
i
did
it
was
you
miss
jones
now
children
then
jeremy
very
politely
please
miss
jones
may
i
help
mary
to
pick
the
books
up
there
are
rather
a
then
both
on
their
knees
more
whispers
and
giggles
miss
jones
her
voice
trembling
children
i
really
insist
and
more
books
dropped
and
more
whispers
and
more
protests
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
a
beautiful
game
to
be
played
all
the
morning
or
there
was
the
game
of
not
hearing
miss
jones
would
say
and
twice
two
are
mary
would
repeat
loudly
and
twice
two
is
five
four
oh

thought

and
then
a
second
later
jeremy
would
ask

you
say

or
five
miss
jones
i
told
mary

said
four
oh

well
as
three

jones

twice
two
and
then
add
three
and
then
twice
two
no
no
i
was
only
telling
jeremy
please
miss
jones
would
you
mind
beginning
again
this
is
a
very
unpleasant
game
for
a
lady
with
neuralgia
or
there
is
the
game
of
making
a
noise
at
this
game
without
any
earlier
training
or
practice
jeremy
was
a
perfect
master
the
three
children
would
be
sitting
there
very
very
quiet
learning
the
first
verse
of
tiger
tiger
burning
bright
a
very
gentle
creaking
sound
would
break
the
stillness
a
creaking
sound
that
can
be
made
if
you
are
clever
by
rubbing
a
boot
against
a
boot
it
would
not
come
regularly
but
once
twice
thrice
a
pause
and
then
once
twice
and
another
pause
who
making
a
noise
dead
silence
a
very
long
pause
and
then
it
would
begin
again
that
noise
must
cease
i
say
jeremy
what
are
you
doing
he
would
lift
to
her
then
eyes
full
of
meekness
and
love
nothing
miss
soon
it
would
begin
again
miss
jones
would
be
silent
this
time
and
then
mary
would
speak
please
would
you
ask
jeremy
not
to
rub
his
boots
together
i
learn
my
verse
i
did
know
i
was
says
jeremy
then
it
would
begin
again
jeremy
would
say
please
may
i
take
my
boots
off
take
your
boots
off
why
they
will
rub
together
and
i
ca
stop
them
because
i
do
know
when
i
do
it
and
it
is
hard
for
mary
of
course
not
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
next
time
you
do
it
you
must
stand
on
your
soon
jeremy
is
standing
on
his
chair
soon
his
poetry
book
drops
with
a
terrible
crash
to
the
ground
and
five
million
pins
stab
miss
heart
with
white
face
and
trembling
hands
she
says
go
and
stand
in
the
corner
jeremy
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
your
mother
he
goes
grinning
at
mary
and
stands
there
knowing
that
his
victim
is
watching
the
door
in
an
agony
lest
cole
should
suddenly
come
in
and
inquire
what
jeremy
had
done
and
that
so
the
whole
story
of
his
insubordination
be
revealed
and
miss
jones
lose
her
situation
for
incapacity
how
did
he
discover
this
final
weakness
of
miss
jones
no
one
told
him
but
he
knew
and
as
the
days
passed
rejoiced
in
his
power
and
his
might
and
his
glory
then
came
the
climax
the
children
were
not
perfectly
sure
whether
after
all
miss
jones
might
not
tell
their
mother
they
did
not
wish
this
to
happen
and
so
long
as
this
calamity
was
possible
they
were
not
complete
masters
of
the
poor
lady
then
came
a
morning
when
they
had
been
extremely
naughty
when
every
game
had
been
played
and
every
triumph
scored
miss
jones
almost
in
tears
had
threatened
four
times
that
the
powers
above
should
be
informed
suddenly
cole
entered
well
miss
jones
how
have
the
children
been
this
morning
if
been
good
i
have
a
little
treat
to
the
children
waited
their
eyes
upon
their
governess
her
eyes
stared
back
upon
her
tormentors
her
hands
worked
together
she
struggled
why
not
call
in
cole
authority
to
her
aid
no
she
knew
what
it
would
mean
i
very
sorry
miss
jones
but
i
think
a
younger
governess
perhaps
her
throat
moved
they
been
very
good
this
morning
the
eyes
of
mary
and
of
jeremy
were
alight
with
triumph
they
had
won
their
final
victory
iii
i
know
what
miss
jones
suffered
during
those
weeks
she
was
not
an
old
lady
of
very
great
power
of
resistance
and
it
must
have
positively
terrified
her
that
these
small
children
should
so
vindictively
hate
her
she
could
not
have
seen
it
as
anything
but
hatred
being
entirely
ignorant
of
children
and
the
strange
forces
to
whose
power
they
are
subject
and
she
must
have
shivered
in
her
bedroom
at
the
dreariness
and
terror
of
the
prospect
before
her
many
many
times
she
must
have
resolved
not
to
be
beaten
and
many
many
times
she
must
have
admitted
herself
beaten
as
badly
as
any
one
can
be
her
life
with
the
people
downstairs
was
not
intimate
enough
nor
were
those
people
themselves
perceptive
enough
for
any
realisation
of
what
was
occurring
to
penetrate
i
hope
you
happy
with
the
children
miss
jones
once
or
twice
said
cole
very
thank
you
said
miss
jones
they
good
children
i
think
although
parents
are
always
prejudiced
of
course
jeremy
is
a
little
difficult
perhaps
it
so
hard
to
tell
what
he
really
thinking
you
find
him
a
quiet
reserved
little
boy
very
said
miss
jones
in
a
little
while
when
you
know
him
better
he
will
come
out
only
you
have
to
let
him
take
his
time
he
does
like
to
be
forced
no
said
miss
jones
meanwhile
that
morning
descent
into
the
schoolroom
was
real
hell
for
her
she
had
to
summon
up
her
courage
walking
about
her
bedroom
pressing
her
hands
together
evoking
the
memory
of
her
magnificent
brother
who
would
she
knew
despise
such
tremors
if
only
she
could
have
discovered
some
remedy
but
sentiment
attempted
tyranny
anger
contempt
at
all
these
things
they
laughed
she
could
not
touch
them
anywhere
and
she
saw
jeremy
as
a
real
child
of
evil
in
the
very
baldest
sense
she
could
not
imagine
how
anyone
so
young
could
be
so
cruel
so
heartless
so
maliciously
clever
in
his
elaborate
machinations
she
regarded
him
with
real
horror
and
on
the
occasions
when
she
found
him
acting
kindly
towards
his
sisters
or
a
servant
or
when
she
watched
him
discoursing
solemnly
to
hamlet
she
was
helplessly
puzzled
and
decided
that
these
better
manifestations
were
simply
masks
to
hide
his
devilish
young
heart
she
perceived
meanwhile
the
inevitable
crisis
slowly
approaching
when
she
would
be
compelled
to
invite
cole
support
that
would
mean
her
dismissal
and
a
hopeless
future
there
was
no
one
to
whom
she
might
turn
she
had
not
a
relation
not
a
friend
too
late
to
make
friends
now
she
could
see
nothing
in
front
of
her
at
all
the
crisis
did
come
but
not
as
she
expected
it
there
arrived
a
morning
when
the
dark
mist
outside
and
badly
made
porridge
inside
tempted
the
children
to
their
very
worst
miss
jones
had
had
a
wakeful
night
struggling
with
neuralgia
and
her
own
hesitating
spirit
the
children
had
lost
even
their
customary
reserve
they
let
themselves
appear
for
what
they
were
infant
savages
discontented
with
food
weather
and
education
i
will
not
detail
the
incidents
of
that
morning
the
episodes
that
were
on
other
mornings
games
were
today
tortures
there
was
the
torture
of
losing
things
the
torture
of
not
hearing
the
torture
of
many
noises
the
torture
of
sudden
alarm
the
torture
of
outright
defiance
the
torture
of
expressed
contempt
when
twelve
struck
and
the
children
were
free
miss
jones
was
not
far
from
a
nervous
panic
that
can
be
called
without
any
exaggeration
incipient
madness
the
neuralgia
tore
at
her
brain
her
own
tore
at
her
heart
her
baffled
impotence
bewildered
and
blinded
her
she
did
not
leave
the
schoolroom
with
the
children
but
went
to
the
broad
and
sat
there
looking
out
into
the
dreary
prospect
then
suddenly
for
no
reason
except
general
weakness
and
physical
and
spiritual
collapse
she
began
to
cry
jeremy
was
considered
to
have
a
cold
and
was
therefore
not
permitted
to
accompany
his
mother
and
sisters
on
an
exciting
shopping
expedition
which
would
certainly
lead
as
far
as
old
poole
the
bookseller
and
might
even
extend
to
martins
the
pastrycook
who
made
lemon
biscuits
next
door
to
the
cathedral
he
was
therefore
in
a
very
bad
temper
indeed
when
he
returned
sulkily
to
the
schoolroom
he
stood
for
a
moment
there
unaware
that
there
was
anybody
in
the
room
hesitating
as
to
whether
he
should
continue
a
flat
iron
for
a
farthing
or
hunt
up
hamlet
suddenly
he
heard
the
sound
of
sobbing
he
turned
and
saw
miss
jones
he
would
have
fled
had
flight
been
in
any
way
possible
but
she
had
looked
up
and
seen
him
and
her
sudden
arrested
sniff
held
them
both
there
as
though
by
some
third
invisible
power
he
saw
that
she
was
crying
he
saw
her
red
nose
mottled
cheeks
untidy
hair
it
was
the
most
awful
moment
of
his
young
life
he
had
never
seen
a
person
cry
before
he
had
no
idea
that
they
ever
did
cry
he
had
indeed
never
realised
that
persons
had
any
active
histories
at
all
any
histories
in
the
sense
in
which
he
and
mary
had
them
they
were
all
a
background
simply
a
background
that
blew
backwards
and
forwards
like
tapestry
according
to
one
need
of
them
his
torture
of
miss
jones
had
been
founded
on
no
sort
of
realisation
of
her
as
a
human
being
she
had
been
a
silly
old
woman
of
course
but
just
as
the
battered
aunt
sally
in
the
garden
was
a
silly
old
woman
her
crying
horrified
terrified
and
disgusted
him
it
was
all
so
dreary
the
horrible
weather
outside
the
beginning
of
a
cold
in
his
head
the
schoolroom
fire
almost
out
everyone
bad
temper
including
his
own
and
this
sudden
horrible
of
a
human
being
she
meanwhile
was
too
deeply
involved
now
in
the
waters
of
her
affliction
to
care
very
deeply
who
saw
her
or
what
anyone
said
to
her
she
did
feel
dimly
that
she
ought
not
to
be
crying
in
front
of
a
small
boy
of
eight
years
old
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
hide
herself
in
her
bedroom
but
she
did
not
mind
she
could
not
mind
her
neuralgia
was
too
bad
it
the
neuralgia
in
my
head
she
said
in
a
muffled
confused
voice
that
he
could
understand
he
also
had
pains
in
his
head
he
drew
closer
to
her
flinging
a
longing
backward
look
at
the
door
she
went
on
in
convulsed
tones
it
the
pain
awake
all
night
and
the
lessons
i
ca
make
them
attend
they
learn
nothing
they
not
afraid
of
me
they
hate
me
never
really
known
children
before
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
had
it
been
mary
or
helen
the
formula
would
have
been
simple
he
moved
his
legs
restlessly
one
against
the
other
miss
jones
went
on
and
now
of
course
i
must
go
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
stay
when
i
manage
so
badly
she
looked
up
and
suddenly
realised
that
it
was
truly
jeremy
you
only
a
little
boy
but
you
know
very
well
that
i
ca
manage
you
and
then
where
am
i
to
go
to
no
one
will
take
me
after
i
been
such
a
the
colour
stole
into
his
cheeks
he
was
immensely
proud
no
person
had
ever
before
spoken
to
him
as
though
he
was
himself
a
person
always
laughing
at
him
like
uncle
samuel
or
talking
down
to
him
like
aunt
amy
or
despising
him
like
jellybrand
but
miss
jones
appealed
to
him
simply
as
one
to
another
unfortunately
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
to
say
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
at
the
moment
was
you
can
have
my
handkerchief
if
you
like
it
pretty
clean
but
she
went
on
if
my
brother
had
been
alive
he
would
have
advised
me
he
was
a
splendid
man
he
rowed
in
his
college
boat
when
he
was
at
cambridge
but
that
of
course
was
forty
years
ago
he
could
keep
children
in
order
i
thought
it
would
be
so
easy
perhaps
if
my
health
had
been
better
it
would
have
been
so
do
your
pains
come
often
asked
jeremy
yes
they
very
i
have
them
too
said
jeremy
it
generally
i
expect
because
i
eat
too
much
at
least
the
jampot
used
to
say
so
they
in
my
head
sometimes
too
and
then
i
really
sick
do
you
feel
sick
miss
jones
began
to
pull
herself
together
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
patted
her
hair
it
my
neuralgia
she
said
again
it
from
my
eyes
partly
i
it
better
to
be
sick
continued
jeremy
if
you
can
be
she
flung
him
then
a
desperate
look
as
though
she
were
really
an
animal
at
bay
you
see
i
ca
go
away
she
said
i
nowhere
to
go
to
i
no
friends
nor
relations
and
no
one
will
take
me
for
their
children
if
cole
says
i
ca
keep
then
i
suppose
you
go
to
the
workhouse
continued
jeremy
pursuing
her
case
with
excited
interest
that
what
the
jampot
always
used
to
say
that
one
day
she
end
in
the
workhouse
and
that
a
horrible
place
she
said
where
there
was
nothing
but
porridge
to
eat
and
sometimes
they
took
all
your
clothes
off
and
scrubbed
your
back
with
that
hard
yellow
soap
they
wash
hamlet
his
eyes
grew
wide
with
the
horrible
picture
oh
miss
jones
you
must
go
there
would
you
mind
she
said
just
getting
me
some
water
from
the
jug
over
there
there
a
glass
still
proud
of
the
level
to
which
he
had
been
raised
but
puzzled
beyond
any
words
as
to
this
new
realisation
of
miss
jones
he
fetched
her
the
water
then
standing
quite
close
to
her
he
said
you
must
stay
with
us
she
looked
up
at
him
and
they
exchanged
a
glance
with
that
glance
miss
jones
learnt
more
about
children
than
she
had
ever
learnt
before
more
indeed
than
most
people
learn
in
all
their
mortal
lives
i
ca
stay
she
said
and
she
even
smiled
a
little
if
always
we
wo
be
naughty
any
he
sighed
it
was
great
fun
of
course
but
we
wo
do
it
any
more
we
never
knew
you
never
knew
i
minded
at
least
we
never
thought
about
you
at
all
helen
did
sometimes
she
said
you
had
a
headache
when
you
were
very
yellow
in
the
morning
but
i
said
it
was
only
because
you
were
old
but
we
be
good
now
i
tell
them
too
then
he
added
but
you
wo
go
away
now
even
if
we
not
always
good
we
wo
always
be
i
suppose
and
i
going
to
school
in
september
and
it
will
be
better
then
i
expect
i
too
old
really
to
learn
with
girls
she
wanted
terribly
to
kiss
him
and
had
she
done
so
the
whole
good
work
of
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
would
have
been
undone
he
was
aware
of
her
temptation
he
felt
it
in
the
air
she
saw
the
warning
in
his
eyes
the
moment
passed
you
wo
go
away
will
you
he
said
again
not
if
you
good
she
said
iv
half
an
hour
later
when
mary
and
helen
returned
from
their
walk
they
were
addressed
by
jeremy
she
was
crying
because
we
been
so
naughty
and
she
had
pains
in
her
head
and
her
brother
was
dead
her
brother
was
very
strong
and
he
used
to
row
in
a
boat
forty
years
ago
she
told
me
all
about
it
just
as
though
i
been
aunt
amy
or
mother
and
she
says
that
if
we
go
on
being
naughty
she
go
away
and
no
one
else
will
have
her
because
hear
about
our
having
been
naughty
and
i
told
her
about
the
workhouse
and
the
porridge
and
the
yellow
soap
that
the
jampot
told
us
of
and
it
would
be
awful
if
she
went
there
because
of
us
would
it
awful
said
mary
but
helen
said
she
would
go
there
she
take
a
little
house
like
miss
dobell
and
have
on
thursdays
somewhere
near
the
no
she
would
said
jeremy
excitedly
how
could
she
take
a
little
house
if
she
had
any
money
she
told
me
she
had
and
no
friends
nor
nobody
and
she
cried
like
anything
he
paused
for
breath
then
concluded
so
we
got
to
be
good
now
and
learn
sums
and
not
make
her
jump
really
and
truly
we
i
always
thought
you
were
very
silly
to
make
so
much
noise
said
helen
in
a
superior
fashion
you
and
mary
babies
we
not
babies
shouted
jeremy
yes
you
no
we
miss
jones
was
no
longer
the
subject
of
the
conversation
that
same
day
it
happened
that
rumours
were
brought
to
cole
through
rose
the
housemaid
or
some
other
medium
for
the
first
time
of
miss
jones
incapacity
that
evening
jeremy
was
spending
his
last
before
bedtime
in
his
mother
room
happily
in
a
corner
with
his
toy
village
he
suddenly
heard
his
mother
say
to
aunt
amy
i
afraid
miss
jones
wo
do
i
thought
she
was
managing
the
children
but
now
i
hear
that
she
ca
keep
order
at
all
sorry
it
so
difficult
to
get
jeremy
sprang
up
from
the
floor
startling
the
ladies
who
had
forgotten
that
he
was
there
she
all
right
he
cried
really
she
is
mother
we
going
to
be
as
good
as
anything
really
we
are
you
wo
send
her
away
will

my
dear
jeremy
his
mother
said
i

there
rose

jones

he
answered
she

about
it
but

her
wo
you
mother
i
do
know
if
she
ca

but
she
can
manage
us

as
anything
i
promise
you
will
keep
her
wo
you
mother
really
jeremy
said
aunt
amy
to
bother
your
mother
so
and
nearly
time
you
went
to
he
brushed
her
aside
you
will
keep
her

dear
said
cole
laughing
you

cried
we

and
we
be
good
with

well
so
long
as
you
good
dear
she
said
i
no
idea
you
liked
her
so
oh
she
all
right
he
said
but
it
is
that
then
he
stopped
he
could
explain
especially
with
that
idiot
aunt
amy
there
only
laugh
at
him
or
kiss
him
or
something
else
horrible
afterwards
as
he
went
slowly
up
to
bed
he
stopped
for
a
moment
in
the
dark
passage
thinking
the
whole
house
was
silent
about
him
only
the
clocks
whispering
what
a
tiresome
bother
aunt
amy
was
how
he
wished
that
she
were
dead
and
what
a
bore
it
would
be
being
good
now
with
miss
jones
at
the
same
time
the
renewed
consciousness
of
her
personal
drama
most
strangely
moved
him
her
brother
who
rowed
her
neuralgia
her
lack
of
relations
perhaps
aunt
amy
also
had
an
exciting
history
perhaps
she
also
cried
the
world
seemed
to
be
suddenly
filled
with
pressing
thronging
figures
all
with
businesses
of
their
own
it
was
very
odd
he
pushed
back
the
schoolroom
door
and
blinked
at
the
sudden
light
chapter
the
i
very
few
citizens
of
the
world
will
understand
the
part
that
the
sea
used
to
play
in
our
young
lives
thirty
years
ago
in
polchester
it
is
very
easy
to
look
at
the
map
and
say
that
the
sea
is
a
considerable
distance
from
polchester
and
that
even
if
you
stood
on
the
highest
ridge
of
the
highest
cornfield
above
the
town
you
would
not
be
able
to
catch
the
faintest
glimpse
of
it
that
may
be
true
although
i
myself
can
never
be
completely
assured
possessing
so
vividly
as
i
do
a
memory
of
a
day
when
i
stood
with
my
nurse
at
the
edge
of
merazion
woods
and
gazing
out
to
the
horizon
saw
a
fleet
of
ships
upon
the
bluest
of
seas
and
would
not
be
persuaded
that
it
was
merely
wrack
of
clouds
that
may
be
or
no
the
fact
remains
that
polchester
sniffed
the
sea
from
afar
was
caught
with
sea
breezes
and
bathed
in
reflected
again
and
again
of
an
evening
the
cathedral
sailed
on
dust
and
shadow
towards
the
horizon
a
great
white
ghost
of
a
galleon
and
the
young
citizens
of
the
town
with
wondering
eyes
watched
it
go
but
there
were
more
positive
influences
than
mere
cloud
and
light
we
had
in
the
lower
part
of
our
town
sailors
quite
a
number
of
them
there
were
the
old
ones
who
would
sit
upon
tubs
and
tell
smuggling
tales
these
haunted
the
river
pol
fished
in
it
ferried
people
across
it
and
let
out
boats
for
hire
there
were
younger
sailors
who
tired
of
the
still
life
of
their
little
villages
and
dreading
the
real
hard
work
of
a
life
at
sea
lurched
and
slouched
by
the
pol
river
bed
fishing
a
little
sleeping
eating
and
drinking
a
great
deal
and
there
were
the
true
sailors
passing
through
perhaps
on
their
way
to
drymouth
to
join
their
ships
staying
in
the
town
for
a
day
or
two
to
visit
their
relations
or
simply
stopping
for
an
hour
or
so
to
gaze
at
the
cathedral
and
the
and
the
canons
and
the
old
women
these
men
had
sometimes
gold
rings
in
their
ears
and
their
faces
were
often
coloured
a
dark
rich
brown
and
they
carried
bundles
across
their
backs
all
in
the
traditional
style
then
there
were
influences
more
subtle
than
either
clouds
or
men
there
were
the
influences
of
the
places
that
we
had
ourselves
seen
in
our
summer
holidays
rafiel
and
lowe
marion
bay
or
borhaze
and
on
the
other
coast
newbock
with
its
vast
stretch
of
yellow
sand
borse
with
its
wild
seas
and
giant
borse
head
or
with
its
coloured
rocks
and
sparkling
shells
every
child
had
his
own
place
my
place
was
like
jeremy
rafiel
and
a
better
more
beautiful
place
in
the
whole
world
you
will
not
find
and
each
place
has
its
own
legend
at
rafiel
the
gold
lured
pirates
and
the
at
polwint
the
giant
excise
man
at
borhaze
the
smugglers
of
trezent
rock
at
borse
the
wreck
of
the
golden
galleon
in
the
year
with
its
wonderful
treasure
and
at
maitsin
cove
the
famous
witch
of
maitsin
church
town
who
turned
men
bones
into
water
and
filled
maitsin
church
with
snakes
back
from
one
summer
holiday
treasuring
these
stories
together
with
our
collections
of
shells
and
seaweed
and
dried
flowers
we
came
and
so
the
tales
settled
in
polchester
streets
and
crept
into
the
heart
of
the
polchester
cobbles
and
haunted
the
polchester
corners
by
the
fire
and
even
invaded
with
their
romantic
peering
mischievous
faces
the
solemn
aisles
of
the
cathedral
itself
the
sea
was
at
the
heart
of
all
of
them
and
whenever
a
blew
down
the
street
carrying
with
it
wisps
of
straw
from
the
field
or
dandelion
seeds
or
smell
of
we
children
lifted
our
noses
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
and
saw
the
waves
curl
in
across
the
shore
or
breakers
burst
upon
the
rock
and
whispered
to
one
another
of
the
smugglers
of
trezent
or
the
pirates
of
rafiel
but
i
think
that
none
of
us
adored
the
sea
as
jeremy
did
from
that
first
moment
when
as
a
small
baby
he
had
been
held
up
in
rafiel
cove
to
see
the
tops
of
the
waves
catch
the
morning
light
as
they
rolled
over
to
shore
he
had
adored
it
he
had
never
felt
any
fear
of
it
he
had
been
able
to
swim
since
he
could
remember
and
he
simply
lived
for
those
days
at
the
end
of
july
when
they
would
all
in
a
frantic
hurry
and
confusion
take
the
train
for
rafiel
and
arrive
at
cow
farm
in
the
evening
with
the
roar
of
the
sea
coming
across
the
quiet
fields
to
mingle
with
the
lowing
of
the
cows
and
the
bleating
of
the
sheep
he
had
in
his
bedroom
a
wonderful
collection
of
dusty
and
sticky
and
these
he
would
turn
over
and
over
letting
them
run
through
his
fingers
as
a
miner
counts
his
gold
let
him
catch
the
faintest
glimpse
of
a
shadow
of
a
sailor
in
the
street
and
he
was
after
it
and
he
had
once
when
he
was
only
four
or
five
been
caught
by
the
terrified
jampot
only
just
in
time
walking
away
confidently
down
the
his
hand
in
the
huge
grasp
of
a
villainous
looking
mariner
he
was
exceedingly
happy
in
his
home
but
he
did
often
wonder
whether
he
would
not
run
away
to
sea
of
course
he
was
going
to
be
a
sailor
but
it
seemed
so
long
to
wait
until
he
was
thirteen
or
fourteen
and
there
was
the
sea
all
the
time
rolling
in
and
out
and
inviting
him
to
come
cole
warned
miss
jones
of
this
taste
of
jeremy
never
let
him
speak
to
a
sailor
miss
jones
there
are
some
horrible
men
in
the
town
and
jeremy
simply
is
not
to
be
trusted
when
sailors
are
miss
jones
however
could
not
be
always
on
her
guard
and
fate
is
stronger
than
any
governess
early
in
february
there
came
one
of
those
hints
of
spring
that
in
glebeshire
more
than
in
any
other
place
in
the
world
thrill
and
stir
the
heart
generally
they
give
very
little
in
actual
reward
and
are
followed
by
weeks
of
hail
and
sleet
and
wind
but
for
that
reason
alone
their
burning
promise
is
beyond
all
other
promises
beguiling
jeremy
got
up
one
morning
to
feel
that
somewhere
behind
the
thick
wet
mists
of
the
early
hours
there
was
a
blazing
sun
after
breakfast
opening
the
window
and
leaning
out
he
could
see
the
leaves
of
the
garden
still
shining
with
their
early
glitter
and
the
earth
channelled
into
fissures
and
breaks
dark
and
hard
under
the
frost
beneath
the
rind
of
the
soil
he
could
feel
the
pushing
heaving
life
struggling
to
answer
the
call
of
the
sun
above
it
far
down
the
road
towards
the
orchards
a
dim
veil
of
gold
was
spreading
behind
the
walls
of
mist
the
sparrows
on
the
almond
tree
near
his
window
chattered
like
the
girls
of
the
high
school
and
blue
shadows
stole
into
the
dim
grey
sky
just
as
light
breaks
upon
an
early
morning
sea
the
air
was
warm
behind
the
outer
wall
of
the
frosty
morning
and
the
faint
gold
of
the
first
crocus
beneath
the
garden
wall
near
the
pantry
door
where
always
the
first
crocuses
came
caught
his
eye
even
as
he
watched
the
sun
burst
the
mist
the
trees
changed
from
dim
grey
to
sharp
black
the
blue
flooded
the
sky
and
the
cathedral
beyond
the
trees
shone
like
a
house
of
crystal
all
this
meant
spring
and
spring
meant
hunting
for
snowdrops
in
the
meads
jeremy
informed
miss
jones
and
miss
jones
was
of
course
agreeable
they
would
walk
that
way
after
luncheon
the
meads
fall
in
a
broad
green
slope
from
the
old
cathedral
battlement
down
to
the
river
pol
their
long
stretches
of
meadow
are
scattered
with
trees
some
of
the
oldest
oaks
in
glebeshire
and
they
are
finally
bounded
by
the
winding
path
of
the
rope
walk
that
skirts
the
river
bank
along
the
rope
walk
in
march
and
april
the
daffodils
first
and
the
primroses
afterwards
are
so
thick
that
from
the
cathedral
walls
the
rope
walk
looks
as
though
it
wandered
between
pools
and
lakes
of
gold
in
the
orchards
on
the
hill
also
they
run
like
rivers
upon
this
afternoon
there
were
only
the
trees
faintly
pink
along
the
river
and
the
wide
unbroken
carpet
of
green
miss
jones
walked
up
and
down
the
rope
walk
whilst
mary
told
her
an
endless
and
exceedingly
confused
story
that
had
begun
more
than
a
week
ago
and
had
reached
by
now
such
a
state
of
to
be
continued
in
our
next
that
miss
jones
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
it
was
all
about
her
mind
therefore
wandered
as
indeed
did
always
the
minds
of
mary
audiences
and
mary
never
noticed
but
stared
with
the
rapt
gaze
of
the
creator
through
her
enormous
glasses
out
into
an
enchanted
world
of
golden
princesses
white
elephants
and
ropes
and
ropes
of
rubies
miss
jones
meanwhile
thought
of
her
young
days
her
illnesses
and
a
certain
hat
that
she
had
seen
in
thornley
windows
in
the
high
street
jeremy
attended
by
hamlet
hunted
amongst
the
trees
for
snowdrops
hamlet
had
been
worried
ever
since
he
could
remember
by
a
theory
about
rabbits
he
had
been
told
of
course
about
rabbits
by
his
parents
and
it
had
even
been
suggested
to
him
that
he
would
be
a
mighty
hunter
of
the
same
when
he
grew
to
a
certain
age
he
had
now
reached
that
age
but
never
a
rabbit
as
yet
had
he
encountered
he
might
even
have
concluded
that
the
whole
rabbit
story
was
a
myth
and
a
legend
were
it
not
that
certain
scents
and
odours
were
for
ever
tantalising
his
nose
that
could
his
instinct
told
him
mean
rabbit
and
only
rabbit
these
scents
met
him
at
the
most
tantalising
times
pulling
him
this
way
and
that
exciting
the
wildest
hopes
in
him
afterwards
condemned
to
sterility
as
ghosts
haunt
the
convinced
and
trusting
spiritualist
so
did
rabbits
haunt
hamlet
he
dreamt
of
rabbits
at
night
he
tasted
rabbits
in
his
food
he
saw
them
scale
the
air
and
swim
the
stream
now
he
was
close
on
their
trail
now
he
had
them
round
that
tree
up
that
hill
down
that
hole
sitting
tranquilly
in
front
of
the
schoolroom
fire
he
would
scent
them
always
they
eluded
him
laughed
at
him
mocked
him
with
their
stumpy
tails
they
were
rapidly
becoming
the
obsession
of
his
nights
and
days
upon
this
afternoon
the
air
was
full
of
rabbit
the
meads
seemed
to
breathe
rabbit
he
left
his
master
rushed
hither
and
thither
barked
and
whined
scratched
the
soil
ran
round
the
trees
lay
cautiously
motionless
waiting
for
his
foes
and
now
and
then
sat
and
laughed
at
himself
for
a
ludicrous
idiot
he
had
a
delightful
afternoon
jeremy
then
was
left
entirely
to
himself
and
wandered
about
looking
for
snowdrops
under
the
trees
talking
to
himself
lost
in
a
chain
of
ideas
that
included
food
and
the
sea
and
catapults
and
a
sore
finger
and
what
school
would
be
like
and
whether
he
could
knock
down
the
youngest
ernest
whom
he
hated
without
knowing
why
he
was
lost
in
these
thoughts
and
had
indeed
wandered
almost
into
the
little
wood
that
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
orchards
when
he
heard
a
deep
rich
voice
say
i
suppose
you
such
a
thing
as
a
match
upon
you
anywhere
young
gentleman
he
liked
to
be
asked
for
a
match
a
manly
thing
to
be
supposed
to
possess
but
of
course
he
had
one
owing
to
the
stupidity
of
elderly
relations
so
he
looked
up
and
said
politely
no
i
afraid
i
then
how
his
heart
whacked
beneath
his
waistcoat
there
standing
in
front
of
him
was
the
very
figure
of
his
dreams
looking
down
upon
jeremy
was
a
gentleman
of
whom
experienced
men
of
the
world
would
have
most
certainly
described
as
jeremy
did
not
see
his
he
saw
first
his
face
which
was
of
a
deep
brown
copper
colour
turning
here
and
there
to
a
handsome
purple
perhaps
but
with
a
fine
round
nose
and
a
large
smiling
mouth
he
saw
black
curling
hair
and
a
yachting
cap
faded
this
last
and
the
white
of
it
a
dirty
grey
but
set
on
jauntily
at
a
magnificent
angle
he
saw
a
suit
of
dark
navy
blue
this
again
faded
spotted
too
with
many
stains
ragged
at
the
and
even
torn
in
one
place
above
the
elbow
fitting
also
so
closely
to
the
figure
that
it
must
have
been
at
bursting
point
he
saw
round
the
neck
a
dark
navy
handkerchief
and
down
the
front
of
the
coat
brass
buttons
that
shook
and
trembled
as
their
owner
chest
heaved
and
what
a
chest
jeremy
had
never
conceived
that
any
human
being
could
be
so
thick
and
so
broad
the
back
spreading
to
the
farthest
limits
of
the
shiny
seams
of
the
coat
was
like
a
wall
the
thighs
were
pillows
the
arms
bolsters
and
yet
not
fat
mind
you
simply
muscle
all
of
it
one
could
see
in
a
minute
that
it
was
all
muscle
the
chest
thrust
forward
the
legs
spread
wide
the
bursting
the
handkerchief
everything
that
jeremy
himself
most
wished
to
be
a
sailor
a
monument
of
strength
with
the
scent
of
his
shag
strong
enough
to
smell
a
mile
away
and
yes
most
marvellous
of
all
gold
rings
in
his
ears
his
chest
would
be
tatooed
probably
and
perhaps
his
legs
also
there
on
the
back
of
his
hand
was
a
blue
anchor
jeremy
looked
up
and
trembled
lest
the
vision
should
fade
then
flung
a
hurried
look
around
him
to
see
whether
miss
jones
were
near
no
one
was
about
he
was
alone
with
the
desire
of
his
life
i
so
so
sorry
i
have
a
match
he
said
i
not
allowed
to
have
them
you
no
i
suppose
not
said
the
vision
just
my
blamed
luck
there
i
am
with
of
pounds
lying
around
my
room
at
careless
as
you
please
and
then
held
up
for
a
bloomin
match
what
gold
to
a
man
like
me
but
a
match
there
you
are
that
he
looked
at
jeremy
with
great
interest
he
took
in
as
jeremy
realised
every
detail
of
his
personal
appearance
i
like
boys
he
said
two
myself
little
nippers
they
was
both
and
gone
as
you
might
say
got
your
nurse
around
anywhere
nurse
said
jeremy
indignantly
i
do
have
a
nurse
i
much
too
old
there
is
a
governess
but
she
over
there
talking
to
mary
my
sister
but
they
wo
bother
yet
not
till
the
cathedral
bell
no
intention
of
your
feelings
young
fellow
my
lad
think
you
want
a
nurse
of
course
big
chap
like
you
thought
you
might
a
baby
brother
or
such
no
offence
i
suppose
you
begun
to
smoke
yet
ca
offer
you
some
jeremy
coloured
the
man
was
laughing
at
him
i
eight
if
you
want
to
know
he
said
and
i
going
to
school
in
school
said
the
mariner
sniffing
contemptuously
i
do
think
much
of
school
if
you
ask
me
now
i
never
went
to
school
and
i
ca
see
that
i
much
the
worse
for
not
been
there
contrariwise
seen
many
a
fine
promising
lad
spoiled
by
too
much
schoolin
be
a
man
of
the
world
i
say
that
the
direction
you
want
to
sail
did
you
really
never
go
to
school
asked
jeremy
not
i
relied
the
sailor
flung
out
at
the
age
of
six
i
was
turned
into
a
boat
sailing
to
the
west
indies
and
left
to
shift
for
myself
and
i
am
a
captain
of
as
fine
a
craft
as
you
ever
likely
to
see
with
gold
in
lockers
and
peacocks
in
the
all
in
a
manner
of
speaking
you
jeremy
eyes
glittered
his
face
was
flushed
a
brilliant
red
hamlet
had
returned
from
his
rabbit
hunting
and
sat
with
his
tongue
out
and
a
wild
adventurous
eye
glittering
up
at
his
master
from
behind
his
hair
yet
he
was
not
noticed
you
were
very
lucky
he
said
devoutly
then
he
went
on
hurriedly
would
you
mind
you
see
miss
jones
may
come
at
any
moment
would
you
mind
he
choked
would
i
mind
what
asked
the
captain
would
you
mind
telling
me
are
you
tatooed
on
your
body
snakes
and
ships
and
things
like
a
gardener
once
we
had
he
had
a
all
down
his
back
he
showed
me
one
the
captain
smiled
proudly
tatooed
talk
of
tatooing
i
show
yer
and
it
is
everybody
i
do
it
for
neither
but
i
taken
a
fancy
to
you
like
my
own
young
nipper
what
with
an
air
of
vast
ceremony
as
though
he
were
throwing
open
the
door
to
all
the
universe
he
slowly
unwound
from
about
his
neck
the
dark
blue
handkerchief
unbuttoned
his
coat
then
a
grimy
shirt
and
displayed
a
wall
of
deep
brown
chest
this
fine
expanse
had
no
hair
upon
it
but
was
illuminated
with
a
superb
picture
of
a
ship
in
full
sail
against
a
setting
sun
all
worked
in
the
most
handsome
of
blue
tatoo
jeremy
gasped
he
had
never
dreamed
that
such
things
could
be
he
ventured
to
touch
the
ship
with
his
finger
and
he
could
feel
the
captain
manly
heart
thumping
like
a
muffled
hammer
beneath
the
skin
there
queen
victoria
on
my
right
thigh
and
nelson
on
my
left
and
the
battle
of
trafalgar
on
the
middle
of
my
back
i
show
you
one
day
it
would
be
decent
exactly
too
public
but
one
day
you
come
to
my
little
place
and
i
show
will
you
really
said
jeremy
did
it
hurt
terribly
hurt
said
the
captain
i
should
just
think
it
did
i
to
put
cotton
wool
behind
my
teeth
to
prevent
myself
from
screaming
but
nothing
what
do
you
say
to
being
tortured
by
the
caribbees
natives
every
day
after
breakfast
for
three
months
a
tooth
out
a
day
but
your
teeth
are
all
there
said
jeremy
false
said
the
captain
every
one
of
and
the
things
they
do
to
your
toenails
it
make
your
creep
on
your
to
listen
to
the
things
i
could
tell
you
oh
it
awful
said
jeremy
and
where
is
your
ship
now
ah
my
ship
the
captain
replied
winking
in
the
most
mysterious
fashion
it
would
be
telling
to
say
where
that
is
i
can
trust
you
i
know
i
a
great
judge
o
character
i
am
but
not
even
with
my
own
mother
gone
to
glory
now
twenty
years
and
as
holy
a
soul
as
ever
breathed
i
would
trust
even
with
the
why
is
it
a
secret
asked
jeremy
breathlessly
treasure
said
the
captain
dropping
his
voice
treasure
nothing
less
nor
more
between
you
and
me
there
enough
gold
on
that
there
ship
to
satisfy
the
prime
minister
to
say
nothing
of
the
jewels
rubies
pearls
diamonds
my
word
if
you
could
see
them
diamonds
i
looking
about
me
now
for
an
extra
man
or
two
and
then
off
again
silent
come
silent
go
my
motto
i
suppose
you
do
happen
to
want
a
gasped
jeremy
his
voice
choked
in
his
throat
well
now
that
a
funny
thing
said
the
captain
it
one
of
the
very
things
but
i
afraid
you
a
bit
young
yet
i
do
know
we
might
he
broke
off
suddenly
lifted
his
finger
to
his
lip
whispered
keep
your
eyes
open
i
be
round
again
and
had
vanished
directly
after
jeremy
heard
miss
jones
unwelcome
voice
why
jeremy
we
could
find
you
anywhere
it
turning
cold
with
a
thump
and
a
thud
and
a
bang
he
fell
back
into
the
homely
world
iii
jeremy
was
a
perfectly
normal
little
boy
and
i
defy
anyone
to
have
discovered
in
him
at
this
stage
in
his
progress
those
strange
morbidities
and
irregular
instincts
that
were
to
be
found
in
such
unhappy
human
beings
as
dostoieffsky
young
hero
in
podrostok
or
the
unpleasant
son
and
heir
of
jude
and
sue
nevertheless
eight
years
old
is
not
too
early
for
stranger
impulses
and
wilder
dreams
than
most
parents
ever
conceive
of
and
the
fortnight
that
followed
meeting
with
the
was
as
peculiar
and
fantastic
a
fortnight
as
he
was
ever
in
all
his
later
life
to
know
for
he
was
haunted
really
haunted
in
the
good
old
solid
practical
meaning
of
the
term
haunted
with
the
haunting
that
pursued
sintram
and
many
another
famous
hero
and
he
was
haunted
not
only
by
the
but
by
a
thousand
things
that
attended
in
that
company
he
was
haunted
by
a
picture
whence
it
had
come
to
him
he
did
not
know
of
a
high
road
dropping
over
the
hill
into
shadow
the
light
fading
around
it
black
heavy
hedges
on
every
side
of
it
from
below
the
hill
came
the
pounding
of
the
sea
exactly
as
he
had
heard
it
so
many
many
times
on
the
hill
above
rafiel
and
he
knew
although
his
eyes
could
not
catch
it
that
in
the
valley
round
the
head
of
the
road
was
the
fishing
village
with
the
lights
just
coming
in
the
windows
and
beyond
the
village
the
sloping
shingly
cove
but
he
could
see
only
the
road
and
upon
this
his
eyes
were
always
fixed
as
though
he
were
expecting
someone
and
he
could
smell
the
and
the
grass
damp
with
evening
dew
and
the
cold
dust
of
the
road
and
the
in
the
wind
and
he
waited
knowing
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
be
told
to
descend
the
hill
pass
through
the
village
and
step
out
under
the
heavy
grey
clouds
upon
the
little
shingly
beach
he
was
aware
then
that
out
at
sea
a
dark
black
ship
was
riding
slipping
a
little
with
the
tide
one
light
gleaming
and
swinging
against
the
pale
glow
of
the
dusky
horizon
the
church
clock
struck
four
below
the
hill
he
was
still
on
the
high
road
waiting
his
eyes
straining
for
figures
he
was
prepared
for
some
journey
because
he
had
at
his
feet
a
bundle
and
he
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
be
there
he
knew
that
something
awful
was
about
to
happen
and
that
when
it
had
occurred
he
would
be
committed
always
to
something
or
someone
a
little
cold
breeze
then
would
rise
in
the
hedges
and
against
the
silence
that
followed
the
chiming
of
the
clock
he
could
hear
first
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
then
a
sudden
pounding
of
the
sea
as
though
the
breakers
responded
to
the
sudden
rising
of
the
wind
then
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
clear
and
hard
upon
the
road
at
that
moment
the
picture
clouded
and
was
dim
had
this
been
a
dream
was
it
simply
a
confusion
of
summer
visits
to
rafiel
stories
told
him
by
mary
pictures
in
books
a
fine
illustrated
edition
of
redgauntlet
had
been
a
treasure
to
him
since
he
was
a
baby
the
exciting
figure
of
the
captain
and
the
beginning
of
spring
and
yet
the
vision
was
so
vividly
detailed
that
it
was
precisely
like
a
remembered
event
he
had
always
seen
things
in
pictures
punishment
meant
standing
in
the
corner
counting
the
ships
on
the
wallpaper
summer
holidays
meant
the
deep
green
meadows
of
cow
farm
or
a
purple
pool
under
an
afternoon
sun
religion
meant
walking
up
the
great
wide
aisle
of
the
cathedral
in
creaking
boots
and
clean
underclothes
and
so
on
it
was
nothing
new
for
him
to
make
a
picture
and
to
let
that
picture
stand
for
a
whole
complex
phase
of
life
but
this
what
had
it
to
do
with
the
and
why
was
it
as
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
wicked
and
wrong
and
furtive
for
this
had
begun
as
a
high
adventurous
romance
there
had
been
nothing
wrong
in
that
first
talk
in
the
meads
when
the
captain
had
shown
him
the
tatooes
the
wickedness
of
it
had
developed
partly
with
his
growing
longing
to
see
the
captain
again
partly
with
the
meeting
that
actually
followed
and
partly
with
the
sense
that
grew
and
grew
as
the
days
passed
that
the
captain
was
always
watching
him
the
captain
during
these
weeks
seemed
to
be
everywhere
never
was
there
an
afternoon
that
jeremy
walked
out
with
miss
jones
and
his
sisters
that
he
did
not
appear
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
snatch
a
conversation
with
him
because
the
beauty
of
the
spring
weather
continued
the
children
went
every
day
for
a
walk
in
the
meads
and
on
at
least
three
separate
occasions
jeremy
and
the
captain
enjoyed
quite
long
conversations
together
these
were
none
of
them
so
good
as
that
first
one
had
been
the
captain
was
not
so
genial
nor
so
it
seemed
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
sometimes
he
put
his
hand
on
jeremy
shoulder
and
the
heavy
pressure
of
his
great
fingers
made
jeremy
tremble
partly
with
terror
partly
with
pleasure
his
face
also
was
scarcely
so
agreeable
as
it
had
seemed
at
first
sight
his
tremendous
nose
seemed
to
burn
down
upon
jeremy
like
a
malignant
fire
his
eyes
were
so
small
that
sometimes
they
disappeared
under
his
fat
cheeks
altogether
or
only
gleamed
like
little
sharp
points
of
light
from
under
his
heavy
shaggy
eyebrows
then
although
he
tried
to
make
his
voice
pleasant
jeremy
felt
that
that
complaisant
friendliness
was
not
his
natural
tone
sometimes
there
would
be
a
sharp
barking
note
that
made
jeremy
jump
and
his
cheek
pale
the
captain
told
him
no
more
fascinating
stories
and
when
jeremy
wanted
to
know
about
the
ship
with
the
diamonds
and
rubies
and
the
little
sea
village
where
she
lay
hid
and
the
caribbees
natives
and
the
chances
of
becoming
a
cabin
boy
and
the
further
exploitation
of
the
tatooes
all
these
things
the
captain
brushed
aside
as
though
they
no
longer
interested
him
in
the
least
he
on
the
other
hand
wanted
now
to
know
exactly
where
jeremy
lived
what
the
house
was
like
where
the
back
doors
were
how
the
windows
opened
where
jeremy
slept
and
so
on
jeremy
pleased
at
this
interest
in
his
daily
life
told
him
as
many
things
as
he
could
hoping
to
pass
on
afterwards
to
more
exciting
topics
how
for
instance
the
kitchen
windows
were
fastened
always
last
thing
at
night
but
you
could
undo
them
from
the
garden
if
you
liked
with
your
knife
and
jeremy
knew
this
because
uncle
samuel
had
done
it
once
on
a
sunday
afternoon
when
the
maids
were
all
out
and
he
forgotten
his
door
key
he
would
have
told
the
captain
all
about
the
schoolroom
and
the
toy
village
and
the
jampot
and
the
fun
they
had
had
teasing
miss
jones
had
not
the
captain
fiercely
told
him
that
these
things
did
not
interest
him
and
that
he
had
better
just
answer
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him
it
was
indeed
strange
to
see
how
with
every
interview
the
captain
grew
fiercer
and
fiercer
and
sharper
and
sharper
he
made
no
allusions
now
to
little
nipper
said
nothing
about
that
holy
soul
his
mother
and
never
mentioned
his
liking
for
jeremy
there
was
evidently
something
on
his
mind
and
if
he
had
seemed
mysterious
at
their
first
meeting
it
was
nothing
to
the
secrecy
that
he
practised
now
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
his
hold
over
jeremy
grew
and
grew
that
dream
of
the
bending
white
road
was
always
with
jeremy
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
captain
and
while
he
was
certainly
afraid
and
would
jump
at
the
slightest
sound
he
was
also
certainly
excited
beyond
all
earlier
experience
he
longed
as
he
lay
awake
at
night
to
see
the
captain
he
seemed
to
have
always
in
front
of
his
eyes
the
great
wall
of
a
chest
with
the
blue
ship
on
it
and
the
bolster
legs
and
the
gigantic
hands
strangest
of
all
was
the
sense
of
evil
that
came
with
the
attraction
he
longed
to
be
in
the
man
company
as
he
longed
to
do
something
that
he
had
been
always
told
not
to
do
and
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
a
sudden
hot
choking
hand
was
pressed
upon
his
heart
and
he
was
terrified
delighted
frightened
ashamed
all
in
one
the
captain
always
alluded
to
the
things
that
he
would
tell
him
would
show
him
one
day
when
you
come
to
my
little
place
i
teach
yer
a
thing
or
two
and
jeremy
would
wonder
for
hours
what
this
little
place
would
be
like
and
what
the
captain
would
teach
him
meanwhile
he
saw
him
everywhere
even
when
he
was
not
there
behind
at
street
corners
behind
the
old
woman
umbrella
in
the
peering
round
the
statues
in
the
cathedral
jerking
up
his
head
from
behind
chimney
pots
looking
through
the
nursery
windows
just
when
dusk
was
coming
on
in
the
passages
under
stairs
out
in
the
dark
garden
and
always
behind
him
that
horrid
dream
of
the
road
and
the
shingly
cove
yes
poor
jeremy
was
truly
haunted
iv
that
miss
jones
suspected
nothing
of
these
meetings
must
be
attributed
partly
to
that
lady
habit
of
wrapping
herself
in
her
own
thoughts
on
her
walks
abroad
and
partly
to
her
natural
once
mary
said
that
she
had
noticed
a
horrid
man
with
a
red
face
staring
at
them
but
miss
jones
although
she
was
not
a
vain
woman
thought
it
nevertheless
quite
natural
that
men
should
stare
and
fancied
more
frequently
that
they
did
so
than
was
strictly
the
truth
jeremy
meanwhile
was
occupied
now
with
the
thought
as
to
what
he
would
do
did
the
captain
really
want
him
to
go
away
with
him
he
discussed
it
with
himself
but
he
did
not
doubt
what
he
would
do
he
would
go
and
he
would
go
he
knew
with
fear
and
dread
and
with
a
longing
to
stay
and
be
warm
in
the
schoolroom
and
have
jam
for
tea
and
half
an
hour
before
bedtime
downstairs
and
yorkshire
pudding
on
sundays
but
the
captain
could
make
him
do
anything
yes
the
captain
could
make
him
do
anything
his
afternoon
walks
now
were
prolonged
agonies
he
would
turn
his
head
at
every
moment
would
stare
into
dark
corners
would
start
at
the
sound
of
steps
his
sleep
now
was
broken
with
horrid
dreams
and
he
would
jump
up
and
cry
out
and
one
night
he
actually
dreamt
of
his
road
and
the
sounds
that
came
up
from
below
the
hill
the
bell
and
the
sea
and
the
distant
rattle
of
the
little
carts
then
the
captain
drew
near
to
the
very
house
itself
he
haunted
orange
street
could
be
seen
lounging
against
a
opposite
the
high
school
looked
once
into
the
very
garden
of
the
coles
jeremy
watching
him
with
beating
heart
from
the
schoolroom
window
it
was
incredible
to
jeremy
that
no
one
else
of
the
house
perceived
him
but
no
one
ever
mentioned
him
and
this
made
it
appear
all
the
more
a
dream
as
though
the
captain
were
invisible
to
everyone
save
himself
he
began
to
hate
him
even
more
than
he
feared
him
and
yet
with
that
hatred
the
pleasure
and
excitement
remained
i
remember
how
years
ago
in
polchester
when
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
six
years
old
i
myself
was
haunted
with
exactly
that
same
mixture
of
pleasure
and
horror
by
the
figure
of
a
pedlar
who
used
to
come
to
our
town
many
years
after
i
heard
that
he
had
been
hung
for
the
murder
of
some
wretched
woman
who
had
accompanied
him
on
some
of
his
journeys
i
was
not
surprised
but
when
i
heard
the
story
i
felt
then
again
the
old
thrill
of
mingled
pleasure
and
fear
one
windy
afternoon
near
dusk
when
they
were
returning
from
their
walk
jeremy
suddenly
heard
the
voice
in
his
ear
i
may
be
coming
to
visit
yer
one
o
these
nights
keep
yer
eyes
open
and
yer
tongue
quiet
if
i
jeremy
saw
the
figures
of
miss
jones
and
his
sisters
pass
round
the
corner
of
the
road
what
for
he
gasped
the
captain
figure
seemed
to
swell
gigantic
against
the
white
light
of
the
fading
sky
the
wind
whistled
about
their
ears
just
to
visit
yer
that
all
i
taken
a
fancy
to
the
captain
chuckled
and
had
vanished
jeremy
flung
one
glance
at
the
grey
desolate
road
behind
him
then
ran
for
his
life
to
join
the
others
what
after
that
did
he
expect
he
did
not
know
only
the
captain
was
drawing
closer
and
closer
and
closer
he
could
feel
now
always
his
hot
breath
upon
his
ear
two
days
after
the
whispered
dialogue
in
the
road
that
first
promise
of
spring
broke
down
into
a
tempest
of
wind
and
rain
the
coles
house
in
orange
street
although
it
looked
with
its
stout
white
stone
strong
enough
was
old
and
shaky
now
in
the
storm
it
shook
and
wheezed
and
rattled
in
every
one
of
its
joints
jeremy
at
ordinary
times
loved
the
sound
of
the
wind
about
the
house
when
he
himself
was
safe
and
warm
and
cosy
but
this
was
now
another
affair
lying
in
his
bed
he
could
hear
the
screams
down
the
chimney
then
the
tug
at
his
the
rattling
clutch
upon
the
wood
then
the
sweep
under
the
bed
and
the
rush
up
the
wallpaper
until
at
last
from
behind
some
badly
defended
spot
where
the
paper
was
thin
there
would
come
a
wailing
whistling
screech
as
though
someone
were
being
murdered
in
the
next
room
on
other
days
jeremy
when
he
heard
this
screech
shivered
with
a
cosy
creeping
thrill
but
now
he
put
his
head
under
the
bedclothes
shut
his
eyes
very
tight
and
tried
not
to
see
the
captain
with
his
ugly
nose
and
tiny
gimlet
eyes
he
would
be
half
asleep
come
said
the
captain
from
the
window
the
boat
is
waiting
you
promised
you
know
come
just
as
you
are
no
time
to
dress
and
poor
jeremy
would
feel
the
great
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
wake
shivering
and
shaking
from
head
to
foot
on
the
third
day
following
his
last
interview
with
the
captain
he
went
to
bed
a
little
reassured
and
comforted
perhaps
the
captain
had
gone
away
for
three
days
he
had
seen
and
heard
nothing
of
him
at
all
that
was
a
night
of
rain
rain
that
slashed
and
whipped
the
house
as
though
it
would
batter
it
to
the
ground
the
rain
would
come
with
a
wild
fury
upon
the
panes
trembling
with
its
excited
anger
would
crash
against
the
glass
then
fall
back
and
hang
waiting
for
a
further
attack
next
the
results
of
the
first
attack
would
slip
and
slide
like
the
crawling
of
a
thousand
snakes
then
fall
and
drop
slowly
and
heavily
as
though
every
drop
were
foretelling
some
awful
peril
jeremy
lay
and
listened
but
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
be
frightened
would
not
think
of
the
captain
he
said
the
lord
prayer
five
times
then
counted
sheep
jumping
over
the
gate
a
safe
solution
for
sleepless
hours
he
saw
the
sheep
first
one
a
very
fat
one
then
one
a
very
thin
one
but
the
gate
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
hill
so
that
it
was
very
difficult
for
the
poor
creatures
who
jumped
and
slipped
back
on
the
incline
then
a
lot
of
sheep
insisted
on
jumping
together
and
he
could
hardly
count
them
he
was
asleep
after
a
long
long
time
of
soundlessness
of
lying
upon
a
sea
that
was
like
a
bed
of
down
and
looking
up
happily
into
clear
blue
light
he
was
once
more
conscious
of
the
rain
yes
there
it
was
with
its
sweeping
rush
its
smash
upon
the
pane
its
withdrawal
its
trickling
patter
and
heavy
drops
as
though
it
were
striking
time
yes
that
was
the
rain
and
that
what
was
that
he
was
wide
awake
lying
back
against
his
pillow
but
his
eyes
staring
in
front
of
them
till
they
burnt
the
house
was
absolutely
dark
absolutely
silent
but
between
the
attacks
of
the
rain
there
was
a
wound
something
that
had
not
to
do
with
the
house
nor
with
the
weather
he
strained
with
his
ears
sitting
up
in
bed
his
hands
clutching
the
bed
clothes
he
heard
it
quite
clearly
now
someone
was
moving
in
the
nursery
with
that
the
whole
of
his
brain
was
awake
and
he
knew
quite
clearly
beyond
a
shadow
of
any
doubt
what
had
happened
the
captain
had
come
to
fetch
him
with
that
knowledge
an
icy
despair
gripped
him
he
did
not
want
to
go
oh
he
did
not
want
to
go
he
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
so
that
the
bed
shook
beneath
him
his
breath
came
in
little
hot
gasping
pants
and
his
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
he
was
helpless
the
captain
would
only
say
come
and
go
he
must
leave
his
warm
house
and
his
parents
whom
he
loved
and
mary
and
helen
and
hamlet
yes
and
even
miss
jones
he
would
be
dragged
down
the
long
white
road
through
the
lighted
village
out
on
to
the
shiny
beach
in
a
boat
out
to
the
dark
ship
and
then
he
would
be
alone
with
the
captain
alone
in
the
dark
ship
with
the
captain
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
his
mouth
smiling
his
great
legs
drawing
him
in
as
a
spider
draws
a
fly
into
its
web
and
everyone
asleep
only
the
stars
and
the
dark
water
he
tried
to
say
the
lord
prayer
again
but
the
words
would
not
come
the
sweat
began
to
trickle
down
his
nose
then
he
heard
in
the
next
room
some
movement
against
a
piece
of
furniture
and
a
voice
muttering
that
decided
him
better
to
go
and
face
it
than
to
wait
there
so
as
though
he
were
moving
in
his
sleep
he
got
out
of
bed
crossed
the
floor
and
entered
the
schoolroom
the
first
sound
that
he
heard
was
the
ticking
of
the
old
nursery
clock
a
strange
familiar
voice
in
this
awful
world
then
suddenly
although
the
room
was
in
black
darkness
he
himself
was
staring
into
blazing
light
he
started
back
and
uttered
a
little
cry
but
even
as
he
did
so
that
hand
was
upon
his
shoulder
and
the
voice
in
his
ear
move
an
inch
utter
a
sound
and
i
blow
yer
brains
out
yer
the
voice
very
low
faded
into
the
dark
he
was
staring
into
a
lantern
and
above
the
lantern
was
the
dark
body
of
the
captain
then
as
he
looked
up
he
was
indeed
near
his
last
moment
for
had
he
not
been
a
brave
boy
old
for
his
years
and
determined
he
would
have
cried
out
with
a
scream
that
would
have
raised
the
house
the
captain
had
no
face
the
captain
had
no
face
only
out
of
a
deep
darkness
those
little
eyes
glittered
like
jeremy
uttered
no
sound
then
catching
the
captain
coat
because
he
trembled
so
he
said
i
coming
at
once
but
do
wake
mary
and
helen
they
be
frightened
may
i
get
a
coat
because
it
raining
coming
whispered
the
captain
his
voice
coming
from
that
space
in
the
air
where
were
his
eyes
you
move
one
inch
from
or
utter
one
sound
and
i
do
yer
in
yer
i
watchin
yer
mind
the
lantern
light
suddenly
vanished
the
room
was
black
there
was
no
sound
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
now
the
rain
which
had
seemed
to
stop
during
this
terrible
dialogue
beat
with
friendly
comfort
once
more
upon
the
pane
jeremy
stood
there
his
body
held
together
as
though
in
an
iron
case
scarcely
breathing
there
was
no
more
sound
at
all
quite
clearly
now
mary
snores
could
be
heard
coming
from
her
room
jeremy
had
only
one
thought
only
one
thought
in
all
the
world
the
captain
did
not
want
him
the
captain
had
gone
and
not
taken
him
with
him
he
was
safe
he
was
freed
the
terror
was
over
and
he
was
at
liberty
at
last
he
moved
back
to
his
room
he
got
into
bed
again
he
was
terribly
cold
and
little
spasms
of
shivers
seized
him
but
he
did
not
care
the
captain
was
gone
and
he
had
not
taken
him
with
him
v
he
was
not
aware
whether
he
slept
or
no
but
suddenly
sunlight
was
in
the
room
the
was
running
the
canary
was
singing
and
hamlet
was
scratching
upon
his
door
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
let
the
dog
in
then
he
heard
rose
voice
from
the
next
room

this
book
is
about
old
maids
but
it
is
hard
for
anyone
who
knows
only
the
thriving
bustling
world
of
today
to
realise
how
largely
we
children
were
hemmed
in
and
surrounded
by
a
proper
phalanx
of
elderly
single
ladies
and
clergymen
i
believe
that
we
were
any
the
worse
for
that
and
to
such
heroines
as
miss
jane
maple
miss
mary
trefusis
and
old
miss
jessamin
trenchard
i
here
publicly
acknowledge
deep
and
lasting
it
did
make
our
life
a
little
monotonous
a
little
unadventurous
a
little
circumscribed
because
t
am
determined
to
give
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
year
of
jeremy
life
that
i
am
describing
this
book
will
also
i
am
afraid
be
a
little
circumscribed
a
little
unadventurous
the
elderly
lady
who
most
thoroughly
circumscribed
jeremy
was
of
course
putting
miss
jones
who
was
a
governess
and
therefore
did
not
count
aside
aunt
amy
now
aunt
amy
was
probably
the
most
conceited
woman
in
polchester
there
is
of
course
ordinary
human
conceit
of
which
every
living
being
has
his
or
her
share
i
am
not
speaking
of
that
miss
amy
trefusis
might
be
said
to
be
fanatically
conceited
although
she
was
now
a
really
plain
elderly
woman
it
is
possible
that
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
was
pretty
in
any
case
it
is
certain
that
she
was
spoiled
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
because
she
was
delicate
and
selfish
she
received
a
good
deal
more
attention
and
obedience
from
weak
and
vacillating
elders
than
she
deserved
after
her
growing
up
she
had
a
year
or
two
of
moderate
looks
and
she
received
during
this
period
several
proposals
these
she
refused
because
they
were
not
good
enough
and
something
better
must
be
coming
very
shortly
but
what
really
came
very
shortly
was
and
it
came
of
course
entirely
unperceived
by
the
lady
she
dressed
and
behaved
as
though
she
were
still
twenty
although
her
brother
samuel
tried
to
laugh
her
out
of
such
absurdities
but
no
sister
ever
pays
attention
to
a
brother
on
such
matters
and
aunt
amy
wore
coloured
ribbons
and
went
to
balls
and
made
eyes
behind
her
fan
for
season
after
season
then
as
time
passed
she
was
compelled
by
her
mirror
to
realise
that
she
was
not
quite
so
young
as
she
had
once
been
so
she
hurriedly
invented
a
thrilling
past
history
for
herself
alluding
to
affair
after
affair
that
had
come
to
nothing
only
because
she
herself
had
ruthlessly
slain
them
and
dressing
herself
more
reasonably
but
with
little
signs
and
hints
in
the
shape
of
chains
and
coloured
bows
and
rings
that
she
could
still
be
young
if
she
so
pleased
and
that
she
was
open
to
offers
although
she
could
not
promise
them
much
encouragement
she
liked
the
society
of
canons
and
was
to
be
seen
a
great
deal
with
old
canon
borlase
who
was
as
great
a
flirt
as
he
was
an
egotist
so
that
it
did
not
matter
to
him
in
the
least
with
whom
he
flirted
and
sat
at
the
feet
of
old
canon
morpheu
who
was
so
crazy
about
the
discoveries
that
he
had
made
in
the
life
of
ezekiel
that
it
was
quite
immaterial
to
him
to
whom
he
explained
them
she
descended
from
these
clerical
flights
into
the
bosom
of
family
life
with
some
natural
discontent
her
brother
samuel
she
had
always
disliked
because
he
laughed
at
her
her
sister
she
did
not
care
for
because
she
was
very
innocently
poor
lady
flaunting
her
superior
married
state
and
her
she
did
not
like
because
he
always
behaved
as
though
she
were
one
of
a
vast
public
of
elderly
ladies
who
were
useful
for
helping
in
clerical
displays
but
were
otherwise
then
she
hated
children
so
that
she
really
often
wondered
why
she
continued
to
live
with
her
but
it
was
cheap
comfortable
and
safe
and
although
she
assured
herself
and
everyone
else
that
there
were
countless
homes
wildly
eager
to
receive
her
it
was
perhaps
just
as
well
not
to
put
their
eagerness
too
abruptly
to
the
test
there
had
been
war
between
her
and
jeremy
since
jeremy
birth
but
it
had
been
war
of
a
rather
mild
and
inoffensive
character
consisting
largely
in
jeremy
on
his
side
putting
out
his
tongue
at
her
when
she
could
not
see
him
and
she
on
her
side
sending
him
to
wash
his
ears
when
they
really
did
not
require
to
be
washed
she
had
felt
always
in
jeremy
an
obstinate
dislike
of
her
and
as
he
had
seemed
to
her
neither
a
very
clever
nor
intelligent
child
she
had
consoled
herself
very
easily
with
the
thought
that
he
did
not
like
her
simply
because
he
was
stupid
so
it
had
been
until
this
year
and
then
suddenly
they
had
been
flung
into
sharper
opposition
it
was
hard
to
say
what
had
brought
this
about
but
it
was
perhaps
that
jeremy
had
sprung
suddenly
from
the
unconscious
indifference
of
a
young
child
into
the
active
participation
of
a
growing
boy
whatever
the
truth
might
have
been
the
coming
of
hamlet
had
drawn
their
attitudes
into
positive
conflict
aunt
amy
had
felt
from
the
first
that
hamlet
laughed
at
her
had
you
asked
her
to
state
as
a
part
of
her
general
experience
that
she
really
believed
that
dogs
could
laugh
at
human
beings
she
would
indignantly
have
repudiated
any
idea
so
fantastic
nevertheless
unanalysed
and
unconfronted
that
was
her
conviction
the
dog
laughed
at
her
he
insulted
her
by
walking
into
her
bedroom
with
his
muddy
feet
and
then
pretending
that
he
had
known
that
it
was
her
bedroom
regarding
her
through
his
hair
with
an
ironical
and
malicious
glance
barking
suddenly
when
she
made
some
statement
as
though
he
enjoyed
immensely
an
excellent
joke
but
above
all
despising
her
she
felt
so
that
the
wall
of
illusion
that
she
had
built
around
herself
had
been
pulled
down
by
at
least
one
creature
more
human
she
knew
in
spite
of
herself
than
many
human
beings
therefore
she
hated
hamlet
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
she
did
not
try
to
have
him
flung
from
the
house
or
at
least
kept
in
the
kitchen
offices
hamlet
had
however
won
the
hearts
of
the
family
it
was
indeed
aunt
amy
alone
to
whom
he
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
pay
court
to
her
alone
he
would
not
come
when
she
called
by
her
alone
he
would
not
be
cajoled
even
though
she
offered
him
sugary
tea
his
deadliest
temptation
no
he
sat
and
looked
at
her
through
his
hair
his
fiery
eye
glinting
his
peaked
beard
ironically
humorous
his
leg
stuck
out
from
his
body
a
pointing
signal
of
derision
she
resolved
to
wait
for
an
opportunity
when
she
might
conquer
hamlet
and
jeremy
together
but
her
power
in
the
house
was
slight
so
long
as
and
cole
were
there
if
i
only
had
the
children
to
myself
she
would
say
i
would
improve
their
manners
in
many
ways
poor
alice
then
suddenly
she
did
have
them
at
the
beginning
of
may
cole
was
summoned
to
take
a
mission
to
the
seamen
of
drymouth
and
cole
who
had
relations
in
drymouth
accompanied
him
they
would
be
absent
from
pelchester
a
whole
week
oh
wo
aunt
amy
be
a
nuisance
said
jeremy
realising
the
situation
then
turning
to
mary
he
added
we
pretend
to
do
what
she
tells
us
and
not
do
it
really
that
much
the
a
week
is
a
short
time
especially
at
the
beginning
of
a
shining
and
burning
may
but
aunt
amy
did
her
best
not
only
with
the
children
but
with
the
servants
and
even
old
jordan
the
gardener
who
had
been
with
the
cole
family
for
twenty
years
during
that
short
week
the
cook
the
parlourmaid
rose
the
housemaid
and
the
bootboy
all
gave
notice
and
cole
was
only
able
to
keep
them
on
her
return
by
raising
the
wages
of
all
of
them
jordan
who
was
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
said
to
her
when
she
advised
him
to
plant
pinks
where
he
had
planted
tulips
and
tulips
where
he
had
planted
pinks
and
further
inquired
why
the
cauliflower
that
he
sent
in
was
so
poor
and
the
cabbages
so
small
leave
things
alone
miss
nature
wiser
than
we
be
not
but
what
you
may
mean
well
but
fussin
never
done
any
good
where
nature
concerned
nor
never
will
and
when
she
said
that
he
was
very
rude
to
her
he
shook
his
head
and
answered
maybe
yes
and
maybe
no
what
rude
to
one
ai
rude
to
another
out
of
which
answer
she
could
make
nothing
at
all
in
the
schoolroom
she
sustained
complete
defeat
at
the
very
outset
she
was
baffled
by
miss
jones
she
had
always
despised
miss
jones
as
a
poor
unfortunate
female
who
was
forced
to
teach
children
in
her
old
age
because
she
must
earn
her
living
a
stupid
sentimental
cowed
old
woman
at
whom
the
children
laughed
she
found
now
that
the
children
instead
of
laughing
at
her
laughed
with
her
formed
a
phalanx
of
protection
around
her
and
refused
to
be
disobedient
miss
jones
herself
was
discovered
to
have
a
dry
rather
caustic
sense
of
humour
that
aunt
amy
felt
to
be
impertinence
but
could
not
penetrate
and
is
that
really
how
you
teach
them
history
miss
jones
not
quite
the
simplest
way
surely
i
remember
an
excellent
governess
whom
we
once
had
perhaps
said
miss
jones
gently
you
would
give
them
a
history
lesson
yourself
miss
trefusis
i
would
be
so
glad
to
pick
up
any
little
hints
i
have
of
course
no
time
said
aunt
amy
hurriedly
but
speaking
generally
i
am
afraid
i
ca
approve
altogether
of
your
it
is
very
good
i
afraid
said
miss
jones
weakly
the
children
would
be
glad
i
know
to
have
a
few
hints
from
you
if
you
could
spare
a
moment
jeremy
who
was
listening
giggled
tried
to
turn
the
giggle
into
a
sneeze
and
choked
jeremy
said
aunt
amy
severely
oh
do
look
aunt
amy
cried
mary
always
jeremy
faithful
ally
all
your
hairpins
are
dropping
out
she
devoted
herself
then
to
jeremy
and
worried
him
in
every
possible
way
and
after
two
days
of
this
he
hated
her
with
a
deep
and
bitter
hatred
very
different
from
that
earlier
teasing
of
miss
jones
that
had
sprung
from
a
sudden
delicious
discovery
of
power
and
had
been
directed
against
no
one
this
was
a
real
personal
hatred
that
children
of
a
less
solid
and
tenacious
temperament
than
jeremy
would
have
been
incapable
of
feeling
he
did
not
laugh
at
her
he
did
not
tease
her
he
no
longer
put
out
his
tongue
at
her
he
was
older
than
that
now
he
was
simply
reserved
and
silent
watching
her
with
his
large
eyes
his
square
body
set
and
resolved
as
though
he
knew
that
his
moment
would
come
her
experience
with
him
was
baffling
she
punished
him
petted
him
she
ignored
him
she
stormed
at
him
it
seemed
that
she
would
do
anything
could
she
only
win
from
him
an
acknowledgment
of
her
power
her
capability
but
she
could
not
he
only
said
yes
aunt
no
aunt
she
burst
out
you
a
sullen
wicked
little
boy
jeremy
do
you
know
what
happens
to
little
boys
who
sulk
no
aunt
they
grow
into
cross
men
whom
nobody
likes
and
nobody
trusts
do
you
want
to
be
like
that
when
you
a
man
i
do
you
know
what
happened
to
care
i
shall
have
to
punish
you
if
you
rude
to
what
have
i
done
that
rude
you
must
speak
to
me
like
that
is
that
the
way
you
speak
to
your
mother
no
aunt
well
then
if
you
do
speak
to
your
mother
like
that
you
speak
to
me
like
that
no
aunt
well
then
this
hatred
was
quite
new
to
him
he
had
once
years
ago
hated
a
doll
that
had
been
given
to
him
he
had
not
known
why
he
hated
it
but
there
it
had
been
he
had
thrown
it
out
of
the
window
and
the
gardener
had
found
it
and
brought
it
into
the
house
again
battered
and
bruised
but
still
alive
with
its
horrid
red
smile
and
this
had
terrified
him
he
had
begun
to
burn
it
and
the
nurse
had
caught
him
and
slapped
him
he
had
begun
to
cut
it
with
scissors
and
when
the
sawdust
flowed
he
was
more
terrified
than
ever
but
that
doll
was
quite
different
from
aunt
amy
he
was
not
terrified
of
her
at
all
he
hated
her
hated
the
fringe
of
her
black
hair
the
heavy
eyelashes
the
thin
down
on
her
upper
lip
the
way
that
the
gold
cross
fell
up
and
down
on
her
breast
her
thin
hands
her
black
shoes
she
was
his
first
enemy
and
he
waited
as
an
ambush
hides
and
watches
for
his
opportunity
ii
one
of
our
nicest
old
maids
miss
maddison
gave
every
year
what
she
called
her
early
summer
this
was
different
from
all
our
other
parties
because
it
occurred
neither
in
the
summer
nor
in
the
winter
but
always
during
those
wonderful
days
when
the
spring
first
began
to
fade
into
the
high
bright
colours
the
dry
warmth
the
deep
green
shadows
of
the
heat
of
the
year
it
was
early
in
may
that
miss
maddison
had
her
party
and
we
played
games
on
her
little
sloping
green
lawn
and
peered
over
her
wall
down
on
to
the
brown
roofs
of
the
houses
below
the
close
and
had
a
tremendous
tea
of
every
kind
of
cake
and
every
kind
of
jam
in
her
wainscoted
that
looked
out
through
its
tall
open
windows
on
to
the
garden
those
old
houses
that
run
in
a
round
the
close
and
face
the
green
sward
and
the
great
western
door
of
the
cathedral
are
the
very
heart
of
polchester
walking
down
the
cobbled
street
one
may
still
look
through
the
open
door
down
the
dusky
line
of
the
little
hall
out
into
the
swimming
colour
of
the
garden
beyond
in
these
little
gardens
what
did
not
grow
hollyhocks
pinks
tulips
nasturtiums
pansies
lilies
of
the
valley
roses
honeysuckle
stocks
i
remember
them
all
at
their
different
seasons
in
that
muddled
absurd
profusion
i
can
smell
them
now
can
see
them
in
their
fluttering
colours
the
great
grey
wall
of
the
cathedral
with
its
high
carved
door
and
watching
saints
behind
me
the
sun
beating
on
to
the
cobbles
the
muffled
beat
of
the
summer
day
the
sleepy
noises
of
the
town
the
pigeons
cutting
the
thin
papery
blue
into
arcs
and
curves
and
circles
the
little
houses
with
crooked
chimneys
and
shining
doors
smiling
down
upon
me
i
can
smell
too
that
especial
smell
that
belonged
to
those
summer
hours
a
smell
of
dried
of
corn
and
poppies
from
the
fields
of
and
bread
and
lemonade
and
behind
the
warmth
and
colour
the
cool
note
of
the
cathedral
bell
echoed
through
the
town
down
the
high
street
over
the
meads
across
the
river
out
into
the
heart
of
the
dark
woods
and
the
long
spaces
of
the
summer
fields
i
can
see
myself
too
toiling
up
the
high
street
my
cap
on
the
back
of
my
head
little
beads
of
perspiration
on
my
forehead
and
my
eyes
always
gazing
into
the
air
so
that
i
stumbled
over
the
cobbles
and
knocked
against
doorsteps
all
these
things
had
to
do
with
miss
parly
and
it
was
always
her
party
that
marked
the
beginning
of
them
for
us
she
waited
for
the
fine
weather
and
so
soon
as
it
came
the
invitations
were
sent
out
the
were
trimmed
the
little
green
wooden
seats
under
the
mulberry
tree
were
cleaned
and
poupee
the
black
poodle
was
clipped
it
happened
this
year
that
miss
maddison
gave
her
party
during
the
very
week
that
and
cole
went
to
drymouth
she
sent
out
her
invitations
only
three
days
before
the
great
event
because
the
summer
had
come
with
so
fine
a
rush
master
jeremy
and
the
misses
cole
would
they
give
miss
maddison
the
pleasure
yes
of
course
they
would
aunt
amy
would
take
them
on
the
morning
of
the
great
day
jeremy
poured
the
contents
of
his
upon
aunt
amy
head
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
accident
arranged
obviously
by
a
malignant
fate
jeremy
had
been
presented
with
a
pot
of
pinks
and
these
every
morning
he
most
faithfully
watered
he
had
a
bought
with
his
own
money
and
because
it
held
more
water
than
the
pinks
needed
he
was
in
the
daily
habit
of
emptying
the
remnant
in
a
glittering
shower
out
of
the
pantry
window
on
to
the
bed
nearest
the
garden
wall
upon
this
morning
someone
called
him
he
turned
his
head
the
water
still
flowed
and
aunt
amy
hatless
and
defenceless
received
it
as
it
tumbled
with
that
sudden
rush
which
always
seizes
a
at
its
last
gasp
jeremy
was
banished
into
his
bedroom
where
he
employed
the
sunny
morning
in
drawing
pictures
of
aunt
amy
as
a
witch
upon
the
wallpaper
for
doing
this
he
was
caned
by
aunt
amy
herself
with
a
ruler
and
at
the
end
of
the
operation
he
laughed
and
said
she
had
hurt
him
at
all
in
return
for
this
impertinence
he
was
robbed
at
luncheon
of
his
pudding
which
was
of
course
on
that
very
day
marmalade
pudding
and
then
mary
being
discovered
putting
some
of
hers
into
a
piece
of
paper
to
be
delivered
to
him
in
due
course
they
were
both
stood
in
different
corners
of
the
room
until
you
say
you
when
the
jingle
arrived
at
three
they
had
still
not
made
this
acknowledgment
and
jeremy
said
he
never
would
not
if
he
lived
till
he
was
at
quarter
past
three
jeremy
might
have
been
seen
sitting
up
very
straight
in
the
jingle
his
face
crimson
from
washing
and
temper
he
was
wearing
his
new
sailor
suit
which
tickled
him
and
was
hot
and
sticky
he
sat
there
devoting
the
whole
of
his
energies
to
the
business
of
hating
aunt
amy
as
i
have
said
he
had
never
hated
anyone
before
and
he
was
surprised
at
the
glow
of
virtuous
triumph
that
this
new
emotion
spread
over
his
body
he
positively
loved
to
hate
aunt
amy
and
as
parkes
the
pony
slowly
toiled
up
the
hill
to
the
cathedral
he
sat
stiff
and
proud
with
an
almost
humorous
anger
then
as
they
turned
over
the
hot
shining
cobbles
into
the
close
and
saw
the
green
trees
swimming
in
the
sun
he
turned
his
mind
to
the
party
what
games
would
they
play
who
would
be
there
what
would
there
be
for
tea
he
felt
creeping
over
him
the
stiff
shyness
that
always
comes
when
one
is
approaching
a
party
and
he
wished
that
the
first
handshaking
and
the
first
plunge
into
the
stares
of
the
critical
guests
might
be
over
but
he
did
not
really
care
his
hatred
of
aunt
amy
braced
him
up
when
one
was
capable
of
so
fine
and
manly
an
emotion
as
this
hatred
one
need
not
bother
about
then
the
jingle
stopped
outside
a
house
immediately
opposite
the
great
door
of
the
cathedral
in
the
little
hall
miss
maddison
was
standing
and
from
the
glittering
garden
behind
her
the
sun
struck
through
the
house
into
the
shadowed
street
jeremy
public
manners
were
when
he
pleased
quite
beautiful
the
true
courtesy
gushing
friends
of
the
cole
family
used
to
say
he
was
preparing
to
be
very
polite
now
when
suddenly
the
voice
of
the
dean
ernest
ordering
people
about
in
the
garden
struck
upon
his
ear
he
had
not
seen
the
dean
ernest
for
nearly
three
months
for
the
very
good
reason
that
that
gentleman
had
been
experiencing
his
first
term
at
his
private
school
last
year
young
ernest
and
jeremy
had
been
on
the
whole
friendly
although
ernest
who
was
nine
and
strong
for
his
age
had
always
patronised
and
now
jeremy
longed
to
inform
his
friend
that
he
also
shortly
would
proceed
to
school
that
in
another
six
months
time
there
would
be
practically
no
difference
between
them
nevertheless
at
the
present
moment
there
was
a
difference
ernest
had
a
whole
term
to
his
credit
new
arrivals
gently
insinuated
the
cole
family
into
the
garden
helen
proud
and
cold
mary
blinking
and
nervous
stood
pressed
close
together
whilst
other
little
girls
stared
and
giggled
moved
forward
and
then
backward
again
until
suddenly
canon
lasker
emily
who
was
fifteen
and
had
such
long
legs
that
she
was
known
as
the
giraffe
came
up
and
said
is
it
hot
do
you
play
croquet
have
the
blue
ball
and
the
coles
were
initiated
meanwhile
aunt
amy
had
said
now
jeremy
dear
run
about
and
make
which
so
deeply
infuriated
him
that
he
choked
oh
supposing
the
dean
ernest
had
heard
her
and
he
had
a
mocking
voice
behind
him
said
now
jeremy
dear
jeremy
turned
round
and
beheld
the
dean
ernest
mockingly
waiting
his
retort
and
he
could
not
retort
no
words
would
come
and
he
could
only
stand
there
his
cheeks
flushed
aware
that
ernest
had
grown
and
grown
during
those
three
months
that
he
wore
a
straw
hat
with
a
ribbon
upon
it
that
round
his
long
ugly
neck
was
a
stiff
white
collar
and
across
his
waistcoat
a
thick
silver
hallo
said
jeremy
hallo
said
the
new
ernest
scornfully
a
long
pause
then
ernest
turning
on
his
heel
said
to
someone
behind
him
let
get
away
from
all
these
girls
the
tears
burnt
in
jeremy
eyes
hot
and
salt
he
clenched
his
fists
and
gazed
upon
a
garden
that
swam
in
a
mist
of
tears
and
sunlight
he
felt
a
sudden
strange
impulse
of
family
affection
he
would
like
to
have
gathered
behind
him
his
father
and
mother
mary
helen
hamlet
uncle
samuel
yes
and
even
aunt
amy
and
to
have
advanced
not
only
upon
ernest
but
upon
the
whole
dean
family
it
would
have
given
him
great
pleasure
to
have
set
his
teeth
into
the
fat
legs
of
the
dean
himself
he
would
gladly
have
torn
the
hat
from
the
head
of
dean
upon
ernest
there
was
no
torture
he
would
not
employ
he
would
get
even
he
resolved
that
before
he
left
that
house
he
would
have
his
revenge
kind
miss
maddison
tripping
along
and
seeing
him
as
a
pathetic
little
boy
in
a
sailor
suit
without
guile
or
malice
swept
him
into
an
i
spy
party
composed
for
the
most
part
of
small
girls
who
fell
down
and
cried
and
said
they
would
go
home
jeremy
hiding
behind
a
tree
watched
the
thin
back
of
ernest
as
it
lifted
itself
autocratically
above
two
small
boys
who
looked
up
to
him
with
ernest
was
obviously
talking
about
his
school
jeremy
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
his
vengeance
forgot
his
game
and
was
taken
prisoner
with
the
greatest
of
ease
he
did
not
care
the
afternoon
was
spoilt
for
him
he
was
not
even
hungry
why
could
he
not
go
to
school
and
then
challenge
ernest
to
combat
but
he
might
challenge
ernest
without
going
to
school
he
had
never
fought
a
real
fight
but
the
sight
of
his
enemy
thin
peaky
body
was
encouraging
now
jeremy
dear
said
miss
maddison
it
your
turn
to
hide
soon
they
all
went
in
to
tea
everyone
was
thoroughly
at
home
by
this
time
and
screamed
and
shouted
quite
in
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
the
long
table
stretched
down
the
whole
room
almost
from
wall
to
wall
the
sunlight
played
in
pools
and
splashes
upon
the
carpet
and
the
flowers
and
the
pictures
there
was
every
sort
of
thing
to
eat
thin
rolled
up
into
little
curly
sandwiches
little
cakes
and
big
cakes
seed
cakes
and
sugar
cakes
and
of
course
saffron
buns
jam
in
little
shining
dishes
and
hot
buttered
toast
so
buttery
that
it
dripped
on
to
your
fingers
jeremy
sat
next
to
mary
and
behind
him
hovered
aunt
amy
only
half
an
hour
ago
how
this
would
have
angered
him
to
have
her
interfering
with
him
saying
not
two
at
a
time
jeremy
or
pass
the
little
girl
the
sugar
jeremy
remember
your
or
not
so
big
a
piece
but
now
he
did
not
know
she
was
one
of
the
family
and
he
felt
as
though
the
dean
ernest
had
scorned
her
as
well
as
himself
also
mary
he
felt
kind
to
mary
and
when
she
whispered
are
you
enjoying
it
jeremy
he
answered
yes
are
you
not
because
he
was
really
enjoying
it
but
because
he
knew
that
she
wanted
him
to
say
that
he
could
see
ernest
from
where
he
sat
and
he
knew
that
ernest
was
laughing
at
him
he
remembered
that
he
had
given
ernest
three
splendid
marbles
just
before
his
departure
to
school
as
a
keepsake
how
he
wished
that
he
had
kept
them
he
would
never
give
ernest
anything
again
except
blows
mary
might
be
tiresome
sometimes
but
she
was
his
sister
and
he
greatly
preferred
her
as
a
girl
to
ernest
sisters
he
could
see
them
now
greedy
ugly
things
now
jeremy
wipe
your
mouth
said
aunt
amy
he
obeyed
at
once
iii
tea
over
they
all
trooped
out
into
the
garden
again
the
evening
light
now
painted
upon
the
little
green
lawn
strange
trembling
shadows
of
purple
and
grey
the
old
red
garden
wall
seemed
to
have
crept
forwards
as
though
it
would
protect
the
house
and
the
garden
from
the
night
and
a
sky
of
the
faintest
blue
seemed
with
gentle
approval
to
bless
the
quiet
town
fading
into
dusk
beneath
it
over
the
centre
of
the
lawn
the
sun
was
still
shining
and
there
it
was
warm
and
light
but
from
every
side
the
shadows
stealthily
crept
forward
a
group
of
children
played
against
the
golden
colour
their
white
dresses
patterns
that
formed
figures
and
broke
and
formed
again
the
cathedral
bell
was
ringing
for
evensong
and
its
notes
stole
about
the
garden
and
in
and
out
amongst
the
children
as
though
some
guardian
spirit
watching
over
their
safety
counted
their
numbers
jeremy
feeling
rather
neglected
and
miserable
stood
in
the
shadow
near
the
oak
on
the
farther
side
of
the
lawn
he
did
not
want
to
play
with
those
little
girls
and
yet
he
was
hurt
because
he
had
not
been
asked
the
party
had
been
a
most
miserable
failure
and
a
year
ago
it
would
have
been
such
a
success
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
standing
now
in
the
middle
of
his
eighth
year
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
that
only
yesterday
he
had
been
a
baby
and
that
he
would
never
be
a
baby
again
he
did
not
feel
his
independence
he
felt
only
inclined
to
tears
and
a
longing
that
he
would
never
never
confess
even
to
himself
that
someone
should
come
and
comfort
him
nevertheless
even
at
this
very
moment
although
he
did
not
know
it
he
a
free
independent
man
was
facing
the
world
for
the
first
time
on
his
own
legs
his
mother
might
have
realised
it
had
she
been
there
but
she
was
not
mary
however
was
there
and
in
the
very
middle
of
her
game
searching
for
him
as
she
was
always
doing
she
found
him
desolate
under
the
shadow
of
the
oak
she
slipped
away
and
coming
up
to
him
with
the
shyness
and
fear
that
she
always
had
when
she
approached
him
because
she
loved
him
so
much
and
he
could
so
easily
hurt
her
said
are
you
coming
to
play
jeremy
i
do
care
he
answered
gruffly
it
is
any
fun
without
she
paused
and
added
would
you
mind
if
i
stayed
here
too
i
rather
you
played
he
said
and
yet
he
was
comforted
by
her
determined
as
he
was
that
she
should
never
know
it
i
rather
stay
she
said
and
then
gazed
with
that
melancholy
stare
through
her
large
spectacles
that
always
irritated
jeremy
out
across
the
garden
i
all
right
he
said
again
only
my
stocking
tickles
and
i
get
at
it
it
the
back
of
my
leg
i
say
mary
do
you
hate
the
dean
ernest
yes
i
do
she
answered
fervently
although
she
had
not
thought
about
him
at
all
enough
for
her
that
jeremy
should
hate
him
then
she
gasped
here
he
comes
he
was
walking
towards
them
with
a
swagger
of
his
long
yellow
neck
and
his
thin
leggy
body
that
jeremy
found
especially
offensive
jeremy
bristled
and
mary
was
conscious
of
that
bristling
hallo
said
ernest
hallo
said
jeremy
what
rot
these
silly
games
are
said
ernest
why
ca
they
have
something
decent
like
cricket
jeremy
had
never
played
cricket
so
he
said
nothing
at
our
school
said
ernest
we
very
good
at
cricket
we
win
all
our
matches
always
i
do
care
about
your
school
said
jeremy
breathing
through
his
nose
the
dean
ernest
was
obviously
surprised
by
this
he
had
not
expected
it
his
pale
neck
began
to
flush
look
here
young
cole
he
said
none
of
your
this
was
a
new
dialect
to
jeremy
who
had
no
friends
who
went
to
school
all
he
said
however
breathing
more
fiercely
than
before
was
i
care
oh
do
you
said
ernest
now
look
here
then
he
paused
apparently
uncertain
for
a
moment
of
his
courage
the
sight
of
timorous
anxiety
however
reassured
him
and
he
continued
it
all
right
for
you
this
sort
of
thing
you
ought
to
be
in
the
nursery
with
your
old
nurse
kids
like
you
ought
to
be
allowed
out
of
their
i
do
care
said
jeremy
again
seeing
in
front
of
him
the
whole
family
of
the
reverend
dean
your
school
is
much
anyway
i
expect
and
i
going
to
school
in
september
and
i
wear
just
the
same
things
as
you
do
and
he
wanted
to
comment
upon
the
plain
features
of
ernest
sisters
but
his
gentlemanly
courtesy
restrained
him
he
paused
for
breath
and
ernest
seized
his
advantage
you
have
to
have
an
old
aunt
to
look
after
you
anyway
an
ugly
old
aunt
i
would
have
an
old
aunt
always
hanging
over
me
jeremy
dear
your
nose
jeremy
dear
your
feet
jeremy
dear
look
at
the
things
she
wears
and
the
way
she
walks
if
i
did
have
to
have
an
aunt
always
i
have
a
decent
one
not
an
old
clothes
what
happened
to
jeremy
at
the
moment
did
he
recollect
that
only
a
few
hours
before
he
had
been
hating
aunt
amy
with
a
fine
frenzy
of
hatred
for
nearly
a
week
he
had
been
chafing
under
her
restraint
combating
her
commands
defying
her
orders
he
had
been
seeing
her
as
everything
that
the
dean
ernest
had
but
now
been
calling
her
now
he
only
saw
her
as
someone
to
be
defended
someone
who
was
his
someone
even
who
depended
on
him
for
support
he
would
have
challenged
a
whole
world
of
deans
in
her
defence
he
said
something
but
no
one
could
hear
his
words
then
he
sprang
upon
the
startled
ernest
it
was
not
a
very
distinguished
combat
it
was
jeremy
first
battle
and
he
knew
at
that
time
nothing
of
the
science
of
fighting
the
ernest
in
spite
of
his
term
at
school
also
knew
nothing
and
the
dean
ernest
was
a
coward
it
lasted
but
a
short
while
for
mary
after
the
first
pause
of
horrified
amazement
aware
only
that
ernest
was
twice
as
big
as
her
jeremy
ran
to
appeal
to
authority
jeremy
himself
was
aware
neither
of
time
nor
prudence
he
realised
immediately
that
ernest
was
a
coward
and
this
realisation
filled
him
with
joy
and
happiness
he
had
seized
ernest
by
his
long
yellow
neck
and
with
his
other
hand
he
struck
at
eyes
and
cheeks
and
nose
he
did
not
secure
much
purchase
for
his
blows
because
their
bodies
were
very
close
against
one
another
but
he
felt
the
soft
flesh
yield
and
suddenly
something
wet
against
his
hand
which
must
he
knew
be
blood
and
all
the
time
he
was
thinking
to
himself
i
teach
him
to
say
things
about
aunt

ernest
meanwhile
kicked
and
kicked
hard
he
also
tried
to
bite
hand
and
also
to
pull
his
hair
but
his
own
terror
handicapped
him
every
inch
of
his
body
was
alarmed
and
that
alarm
prevented
the
freedom
of
his
limbs
then
when
he
felt
the
blood
from
his
nose
trickle
on
to
his
cheek
his
resistance
was
at
an
end
panic
flooded
over
him
like
water
he
broke
away
and
flung
himself
howling
on
to
the
ground
kicking
his
legs
and
screaming
it
is
fair
he
bitten

take
him
away

him
away
jeremy
himself
was
no
beautiful
sight
his
hair
was
wild
his
white
navy
collar
crumpled
and
soiled
the
buttons
of
his
tunic
torn
his
stocking
down
and
his
legs
already
displaying
purple
bruises
but
he
did
not
care
he
was
well
now
he
was
no
longer
unhappy
he
had
beaten
ernest
and
he
was
a
man
he
had
risen
victorious
from
his
first
fight
and
authority
might
storm
as
it
pleased
authority
soon
arrived
and
there
were
of
course
many
cries
and
exclamations
ernest
was
led
away
still
howling
jeremy
stubborn
obstinate
and
silent
was
also
led
away
a
disgraceful
incident
aunt
amy
of
course
was
disgusted
could
leave
the
boy
alone
one
minute
but
he
must
misbehave
himself
upset
the
party
be
the
little
ruffian
that
he
always
was
she
had
always
said
that
his
mother
spoiled
him
and
here
were
the
fruits
of
that
foolishness
how
could
she
ever
say
enough
to
miss
maddison
her
delightful
party
completely
ruined
shocking
shocking
too
terrible
and
ernest
such
a
quiet
little
boy
as
a
rule
it
must
have
been
jeremy
who
while
they
were
waiting
in
the
decent
dusk
of
miss
for
a
cleaned
and
chastened
jeremy
mary
touched
her
arm
and
whispered
in
her
nervous
voice
aunt
amy
jeremy
hit
ernest
because
he
said
rude
things
about
about
me
nonsense
no
but
it
was
really
ernest
said
horrid
things
about
you
and
then
jeremy
hit
about
me
what
things
that
you
were
ugly
eagerly
continued
mary
never
a
tactful
child
and
intent
now
only
upon
jeremy
reputation
and
wore
ugly
clothes
and
horrid
things
he
did
really
i
heard
it
aunt
amy
was
deeply
moved
her
conceit
her
abnormal
conceit
was
wounded
yes
even
by
so
insignificant
a
creature
as
the
dean
ernest
but
she
was
also
unexpectedly
touched
she
would
have
greatly
preferred
not
to
be
touched
but
there
it
was
she
could
not
help
herself
she
did
not
know
that
in
all
her
life
before
anyone
had
ever
fought
for
her
and
that
now
of
all
champions
in
the
world
fate
should
have
chosen
jeremy
who
was
she
had
supposed
her
enemy
never
her
defender
and
that
horrid
child
of
the
dean
she
had
always
disliked
him
with
his
long
yellow
neck
and
watery
eyes
how
dared
he
say
such
things
about
her
he
had
always
been
rude
to
her
she
remembered
once
jeremy
arrived
washed
brushed
and
obstinate
he
would
of
course
be
scolded
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
he
did
not
care
he
had
seen
the
dean
ernest
howling
and
kicking
on
the
ground
he
had
soiled
his
straw
hat
for
him
dirtied
his
stiff
white
collar
for
him
and
made
his
nose
bleed
he
glared
at
his
aunt
one
eye
was
rapidly
disappearing
beneath
a
blue
bruise
and
he
was
proud
triumphant
and
very
tired
farewells
were
made
again
many
apologies
nothing
i
assure
you
nothing
boys
will
be
boys
i
know
from
miss
maddison
then
they
were
seated
in
the
jingle
jeremy
next
to
aunt
amy
awaiting
his
scolding
it
did
not
come
aunt
amy
tried
she
knew
what
she
should
say
she
should
be
very
angry
disgusted
ashamed
she
could
not
be
any
of
these
things
that
horrid
boy
had
insulted
her
she
was
touched
and
proud
as
she
had
never
been
touched
and
proud
in
her
life
before
jeremy
waited
and
then
as
nothing
came
his
weariness
grew
upon
him
as
the
old
fat
pony
jogged
along
as
the
evening
colours
of
street
and
sky
danced
before
him
sleep
came
nearer
and
nearer
he
nodded
recovered
nodded
and
nodded
again
his
body
pressed
closer
to
aunt
amy
leaned
against
her
his
head
rested
upon
her
shoulder
after
a
moment
pause
she
put
her
arm
round
him
so
holding
him
she
stared
defiantly
and
crossly
upon
the
world
chapter
vii
religion
i
always
in
after
years
jeremy
remembered
that
party
of
miss
maddison
not
because
it
had
been
there
that
he
had
won
his
first
fight
but
for
the
deeper
reason
that
from
that
day
his
life
received
a
new
colour
woven
into
the
texture
of
it
even
now
when
he
thinks
of
those
hours
that
followed
miss
maddison
party
he
catches
his
breath
and
glances
around
him
to
see
whether
everything
is
safe
the
children
on
arriving
home
that
evening
found
that
their
father
and
mother
had
already
returned
from
drymouth
jeremy
sleepy
though
he
was
rushed
to
his
mother
held
her
hand
explained
his
black
eye
and
then
suddenly
in
a
way
that
he
had
fell
asleep
there
as
he
was
and
had
to
be
carried
up
to
bed
when
he
awoke
next
morning
his
first
thought
was
of
his
mother
he
did
not
know
why
she
was
so
definitely
part
of
the
background
of
his
daily
life
that
he
felt
too
sure
of
her
continual
and
abiding
presence
to
need
deliberate
thought
of
her
but
this
morning
he
wanted
to
get
up
quickly
and
find
her
perhaps
her
absence
had
made
him
feel
more
insecure
but
there
had
also
been
something
that
night
something
in
her
face
something
in
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
the
other
thing
that
he
realised
was
that
summer
had
truly
come
he
knew
at
once
that
hot
smell
that
pressed
even
through
the
closed
of
his
room
the
bars
and
squares
of
light
on
the
floor
when
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
stood
upon
them
seemed
to
burn
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
the
rays
of
light
on
the
ceiling
quivered
as
only
summer
sunlight
can
quiver
the
two
windows
of
his
bedroom
looked
back
behind
polchester
over
fields
and
hedges
to
a
dim
purple
line
of
wood
a
tiny
stream
ran
through
the
first
two
fields
and
this
little
river
was
shining
now
with
a
white
hot
light
that
had
yet
the
breeze
of
the
morning
ruffling
it
he
ran
to
his
window
and
opened
it
beyond
the
wall
that
bordered
their
house
was
a
little
brown
path
and
down
this
path
even
as
he
watched
a
company
of
cows
were
slowly
wandering
along
already
they
were
flapping
their
ears
lazily
in
anticipation
of
the
flies
and
the
boy
who
was
driving
them
was
whistling
as
one
only
whistles
on
a
summer
morning
he
could
see
the
buttercups
too
in
the
nearest
field
they
seemed
to
have
sprung
to
life
in
the
space
of
a
night
someone
was
pulling
the
rope
of
a
well
somewhere
and
someone
else
was
pouring
water
out
upon
some
stone
court
even
as
he
watched
a
bee
came
blundering
up
to
his
window
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
went
whirring
off
again
and
through
all
the
sun
and
glitter
and
the
sparkle
of
the
little
river
there
was
a
scent
of
pinks
and
mignonette
and
even
although
it
could
not
really
be
so
of
the
gorse
the
sky
was
a
pale
white
blue
so
pale
that
it
was
scarcely
any
colour
at
all
and
a
few
puffs
of
clouds
dead
white
like
the
purest
smoke
hovered
in
dancing
procession
above
the
purple
wood
the
sun
burnt
upon
his
bare
feet
and
his
head
and
his
hands
this
coming
of
summer
meant
so
much
more
to
him
than
merely
the
immediate
joy
of
it
it
meant
rafiel
and
cow
farm
and
the
cove
and
green
pools
with
crabs
in
them
and
shrimping
and
paddling
and
riding
home
in
the
evening
on
haycarts
and
drinking
milk
out
of
tin
cans
and
cows
and
small
pigs
and
peeling
sticks
and
apples
and
collecting
shells
and
fishermen
nets
and
sandwiches
and
saffron
buns
mixed
with
sand
and
hot
ginger
beer
and
one
ears
peeling
with
the
sun
and
church
on
sunday
with
the
rafiel
sheep
cropping
the
grass
just
outside
the
church
door
and
dick
marriott
the
fisherman
and
slipping
along
over
the
green
water
trailing
one
fingers
in
the
water
in
his
boat
and
fishy
smells
by
the
and
red
masses
of
on
the
pier
and
the
still
cool
feel
of
the
farmhouse
sheets
just
after
getting
into
bed
all
these
things
and
a
thousand
more
the
coming
of
summer
meant
to
jeremy
but
this
morning
he
did
not
feel
his
customary
joy
closing
his
window
and
dressing
slowly
he
wondered
what
was
the
matter
what
could
it
be
it
was
not
his
eye
certainly
it
was
a
funny
colour
this
morning
and
it
hurt
when
you
touched
it
but
he
was
proud
of
that
no
it
was
not
his
eye
and
it
was
not
the
dog
who
came
into
his
room
after
scratching
on
the
door
and
made
his
usual
morning
pretence
of
having
come
for
any
other
purpose
than
to
see
his
friend
and
master
first
looking
under
the
bed
then
going
up
to
the
window
pretending
to
gaze
out
of
it
which
he
could
not
do
barking
then
rolling
on
a
square
of
sunlit
carpet
and
after
that
lying
on
his
back
his
legs
out
stiff
his
ridiculous
imperial
pointed
and
ironical
then
suddenly
turning
with
a
twist
on
his
legs
rushing
at
last
up
to
jeremy
barking
at
him
laughing
at
him
licking
him
and
even
biting
his
stockings
last
of
all
seizing
a
bedroom
slipper
and
rushing
wildly
into
the
schoolroom
with
it
no
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
hamlet
nor
was
there
anything
the
matter
with
miss
jones
free
happily
from
her
customary
neuralgia
and
delighted
with
the
new
number
of
the
church
times
nor
was
it
the
breakfast
which
included
bacon
and
strawberry
jam
nor
finally
was
it
mary
or
helen
who
pleased
with
the
summer
weather
and
mary
additionally
pleased
with
the
virtues
of
lance
as
minutely
recorded
in
the
second
volume
of
the
pillars
of
the
house
were
both
in
the
most
amiable
of
tempers
no
it
must
be
something
inside
jeremy
himself
he
waited
until
the
end
of
breakfast
to
ask
his
question
can
i
go
and
see
mother
miss
jones
mary
and
helen
looked
across
at
him
inquisitively
what
do
you
want
to
see
your
mother
for
now
jeremy
you
always
see
her
at
twelve
miss
jones
pushed
her
spectacles
lower
upon
her
nose
and
continued
her
reading
i
want
well
you
ca
why
not
because
i
say
not
that
but
jeremy
was
gentle
he
got
off
his
chair
went
round
to
miss
jones
chair
and
looking
up
at
her
out
of
his
bruised
eye
said
in
the
most
touching
voice
but
please
miss
jones
i
want
to
i
really
then
she
said
what
he
had
known
all
the
time
was
coming
i
afraid
you
wo
see
your
mother
dear
she
not
well
she
in
why
is
she
ill
she
tired
after
her
journey
yesterday
i
he
said
no
more
he
tried
during
the
whole
of
that
day
not
to
think
of
his
mother
and
he
found
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
could
do
nothing
else
but
think
of
her
during
the
morning
he
sat
very
silently
over
his
lessons
did
all
that
he
was
told
did
not
once
kick
mary
under
the
table
nor
ask
miss
jones
to
sharpen
his
pencil
nor
make
faces
at
hamlet
once
or
twice
in
a
way
that
he
had
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
as
though
he
were
an
ancient
professor
with
a
whole
library
of
great
works
behind
him
and
when
miss
jones
asked
him
whether
he
had
a
headache
he
said
no
thank
you
instead
of
seizing
on
the
wonderful
opportunity
of
release
that
such
a
question
offered
him
when
they
all
went
for
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
he
sprang
for
a
moment
into
something
of
his
natural
vivacity
they
came
upon
a
thin
tramp
dressed
as
a
sailor
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
producing
terrible
discordance
from
a
fiddle
this
individual
held
in
one
hand
a
black
tin
cup
and
at
his
side
crouched
a
mongrel
terrier
whose
beaten
and
dishevelled
appearance
created
at
once
hopes
in
the
breast
of
the
flamboyant
hamlet
this
couple
were
posted
just
outside
poole
bookshop
close
to
the
box
and
for
a
moment
jeremy
was
enthralled
he
wanted
to
give
the
hero
his
week
penny
and
upon
finding
that
his
penny
was
not
owing
to
sweet
purchases
on
the
previous
day
he
began
elaborate
bargainings
with
miss
jones
as
to
the
forestalling
of
future
pennies
meanwhile
hamlet
leapt
with
every
sign
of
joyful
expectation
upon
the
pauper
dog
the
blind
sailor
began
to
hit
wildly
about
with
his
stick
poole
box
was
upset
and
the
sailor
black
patch
fell
off
revealing
him
as
the
possessor
of
two
beautiful
eyes
just
like
any
other
gentleman
and
a
fine
vigorous
stock
of
the
best
glebeshire
profanities
poole
an
irascible
old
man
himself
came
out
a
policeman
approached
two
old
ladies
from
the
close
well
known
to
jeremy
were
shocked
by
the
tramp
and
the
cathedral
bell
as
though
it
had
just
awoken
up
to
its
real
responsibilities
suddenly
began
to
ring
all
this
was
of
course
delightful
to
jeremy
and
offered
so
many
possible
veins
of
interest
that
he
could
have
stayed
there
for
hours
he
wanted
very
badly
to
ask
the
sailor
why
he
covered
up
a
perfectly
wholesome
eye
with
a
black
patch
and
he
would
have
liked
to
see
what
hamlet
could
do
in
the
direction
of
eating
up
the
scattered
remnants
of
poole
box
but
he
was
dragged
away
by
the
agitated
hand
of
miss
jones
having
to
console
himself
finally
with
a
wink
from
the
august
policeman
who
known
throughout
polchester
as
tom
noddy
was
a
kindly
soul
and
liked
gentlemanly
little
boys
but
persecuted
the
street
sort
for
a
moment
this
exciting
adventure
carried
him
away
and
he
even
listened
for
a
minute
or
two
to
mary
who
seizing
her
opportunity
began
hurriedly
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
sailor
very
thin
and
he
never
washed
and
he
had
a
dog
and
a
violin
but
soon
he
remembered
and
sighed
and
said
oh
bother
mary
and
then
walked
on
by
himself
and
still
all
through
that
hot
afternoon
when
even
the
rope
walk
did
not
offer
any
shade
and
when
the
pol
was
of
so
clear
a
colour
that
you
could
see
trout
and
emerald
stones
and
golden
sand
as
under
glass
and
when
hamlet
was
compelled
to
run
ahead
and
find
a
piece
of
shade
and
lie
there
stretched
panting
with
his
tongue
out
until
they
came
up
to
him
even
all
these
signs
of
a
true
and
marvellous
summer
did
not
relieve
jeremy
of
his
burden
something
horrible
was
going
to
happen
he
knew
it
with
such
certainty
that
he
wondered
how
mary
and
helen
could
be
so
gaily
and
despised
them
for
their
carelessness
this
was
connected
in
some
way
with
the
hot
weather
he
felt
as
though
were
a
cold
breeze
suddenly
to
come
and
rain
to
fall
he
would
be
happy
again
there
had
been
once
a
boy
older
than
he
called
jimmy
bain
a
fat
plump
boy
who
had
lived
next
door
to
the
coles
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
he
bullied
jeremy
pinching
his
arms
putting
pins
into
his
legs
and
shouting
suddenly
into
his
ears
jeremy
who
had
feared
johnny
bain
had
always
felt
the
stout
arrival
before
he
appeared
the
sky
had
seemed
to
darken
the
air
to
thicken
the
birds
to
gather
in
the
rooky
wood
he
had
trembled
and
shaken
his
teeth
had
chattered
and
his
throat
grown
dry
for
no
reason
at
all
as
he
had
once
felt
about
johnny
bain
so
now
he
felt
about
life
in
general
something
horrible
was
going
to
happen
something
to
do
with
mother
as
he
came
up
the
road
to
their
house
his
heart
beat
so
that
he
could
not
hear
his
own
steps
ii
they
entered
the
house
and
at
once
even
mary
preoccupied
as
she
was
with
her
story
about
the
sailor
noticed
that
something
was
wrong
rose
rose
she
called
out
loudly
hush
said
miss
jones
you
must
be
quiet
why
said
mary
i
want
rose
to
your
mother
is
at
all
well
dear
i
and
she
was
interrupted
by
rose
who
coming
suddenly
downstairs
with
a
face
very
different
from
her
usual
cheerful
one
said
something
to
miss
jones
in
a
low
voice
miss
jones
gave
a
little
cry
so
soon
a
girl
and
then
added
how
is
she
then
rose
said
something
more
which
the
children
could
not
catch
and
vanished
very
quietly
children
said
miss
jones
in
a
voice
that
trembled
and
you
must
leave
the
schoolroom
till
i
tell
you
your
mother
she
broke
off
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
showing
emotion
what
is
it
said
jeremy
in
a
voice
that
seemed
new
to
them
all
older
more
resolute
strangely
challenging
for
so
small
a
boy
your
mother
very
ill
jeremy
dear
you
must
be
a
very
good
boy
and
help
your
might
i
go
for
just
a
minute
no
certainly
they
all
went
upstairs
then
in
the
schoolroom
miss
jones
said
an
amazing
thing
she
said
i
must
tell
you
all
children
that
you
got
a
new
little
a
new
sister
screamed
mary
helen
said
oh
miss
jones
jeremy
said
what
did
she
come
for
just
now
when
mother
is
ill
god
wanted
her
to
come
dear
said
miss
jones
you
must
all
be
very
kind
to
her
and
do
all
you
can
she
was
interrupted
by
a
torrent
of
questions
from
the
two
girls
what
was
she
like
what
was
her
name
could
she
walk
where
did
she
come
from
did
father
and
mother
find
her
in
drymouth
and
so
on
jeremy
was
silent
at
last
he
said
we
do
want
any
more
girls
better
than
having
another
boy
said
helen
but
he
would
not
take
up
the
challenge
he
sat
on
his
favourite
seat
on
the
dragged
up
a
reluctant
hamlet
to
sit
with
him
and
gazed
out
down
into
the
garden
that
was
misty
now
in
the
evening
golden
light
the
trees
and
the
soil
black
beneath
the
gold
the
rooks
slowly
swinging
across
the
sty
above
the
farther
side
of
the
road
hamlet
wriggled
he
always
detested
that
he
should
be
cuddled
and
he
would
press
first
with
one
leg
then
with
another
against
jeremy
coat
then
he
would
lie
dead
for
a
moment
suddenly
springing
with
his
head
up
in
the
hope
that
the
surprise
would
free
him
then
he
would
turn
into
a
snake
twisting
his
body
under
jeremy
arm
and
dropping
with
a
flop
on
to
the
floor
all
these
manoeuvres
availed
him
nothing
jeremy
held
his
neck
in
a
vice
and
dug
his
fingers
well
into
the
skin
hamlet
whined
then
lay
still
and
in
the
midst
of
indignant
reflections
against
the
imbecile
tyrannies
of
man
fell
to
his
own
surprise
asleep
jeremy
sat
there
whilst
the
dusk
fell
and
all
the
beautiful
lights
were
drawn
from
the
sky
and
the
rooks
went
to
bed
rose
came
to
draw
the
curtains
and
then
he
left
his
dragged
out
his
toy
village
and
pretended
to
play
with
it
he
looked
at
his
sisters
they
seemed
quite
tranquil
helen
was
sewing
and
mary
deep
in
the
pillars
of
the
the
clock
ticked
hamlet
lost
in
sleep
snored
and
sputtered
the
whole
world
pursued
its
ordinary
way
only
in
himself
something
was
changed
he
was
unhappy
and
he
could
not
account
for
his
unhappiness
it
should
have
been
because
his
mother
was
ill
and
yet
she
had
been
ill
before
and
he
had
been
only
disturbed
for
a
moment
after
all
people
always
got
well
there
had
been
aunt
amy
who
had
had
measles
and
the
wife
of
the
dean
who
had
had
something
and
even
the
bishop
once
but
now
he
was
frightened
there
was
some
perception
coming
to
him
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
this
world
was
not
absolutely
stable
that
people
left
it
people
came
into
it
that
there
was
change
and
danger
and
something
stronger
gradually
this
perception
was
approaching
him
as
though
it
had
been
some
dark
figure
who
had
entered
the
house
and
now
with
muffled
step
and
veiled
face
was
slowly
climbing
the
stairs
towards
him
he
only
knew
that
his
mother
could
not
go
she
could
not
go
she
was
part
of
his
life
and
she
would
always
be
so
why
now
when
he
thought
of
it
he
could
do
nothing
without
his
mother
every
day
he
must
tell
her
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
was
going
to
do
must
show
her
what
he
had
acquired
and
must
explain
to
her
what
he
had
lost
must
go
to
her
when
he
was
hurt
and
when
he
was
frightened
and
when
he
was
glad
and
of
all
these
things
he
had
never
even
thought
until
now
as
he
sat
there
the
house
seemed
to
grow
ever
quieter
and
quieter
about
him
he
felt
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
have
gone
to
the
schoolroom
door
and
listened
it
was
terrible
imagining
the
house
behind
the
door
quite
silent
so
that
the
clocks
had
stopped
and
no
one
walked
upon
the
stairs
and
no
one
laughed
down
in
the
pantry
he
wished
that
they
would
make
more
noise
in
the
schoolroom
he
upset
the
church
and
the
orchard
and
noah
but
the
silence
after
the
noise
was
worse
than
ever
soon
miss
jones
took
the
two
girls
away
to
her
room
to
fit
on
some
clothes
an
operation
which
helen
adored
and
mary
hated
jeremy
was
left
alone
and
he
was
at
once
terribly
frightened
he
knew
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
be
frightened
and
he
tried
to
go
on
with
his
game
putting
the
church
with
the
apple
trees
around
it
and
the
noah
family
all
sleeping
under
the
trees
but
at
every
moment
something
compelled
him
to
raise
his
head
and
see
that
no
one
was
there
and
he
felt
so
small
and
so
lonely
that
he
would
like
to
have
hidden
under
something
then
when
he
thought
of
his
mother
all
alone
and
the
house
so
quiet
around
her
and
no
one
able
to
go
to
her
he
felt
so
miserable
that
he
turned
round
from
his
village
and
stared
desolately
into
the
fireplace
the
thought
of
his
new
sister
came
to
him
but
was
dismissed
impatiently
he
did
not
want
a
new
sister
mary
and
helen
were
trouble
enough
as
it
was
and
he
felt
with
an
old
weary
air
that
it
was
time
indeed
that
he
was
off
to
school
nothing
was
the
same
always
new
people
never
any
peace
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
and
turning
saw
his
father
his
father
and
he
were
never
very
easy
together
cole
had
very
little
time
for
the
individual
being
engaged
in
saving
souls
in
the
mass
and
his
cheery
christianity
had
a
strange
startling
fashion
of
proving
unavailing
before
some
single
human
case
he
did
not
understand
children
except
when
they
were
placed
in
masses
before
him
his
own
children
having
been
named
on
their
arrival
gifts
from
god
had
kept
much
of
that
incorporeal
atmosphere
throughout
their
growing
years
but
he
was
a
different
man
as
he
looked
at
his
small
son
across
the
schoolroom
floor
there
was
terror
in
his
eyes
nothing
could
have
been
easier
or
more
simple
than
his
lifelong
assumption
that
because
god
was
in
his
heaven
all
was
right
with
the
world
he
had
given
thanks
every
evening
for
the
blessings
that
he
had
received
and
every
morning
for
the
blessings
that
he
was
going
to
receive
and
he
had
had
no
reason
to
complain
he
had
the
wife
the
children
the
work
that
he
deserved
and
his
life
had
been
so
hemmed
in
with
security
that
he
had
had
no
difficulty
in
assuring
his
congregation
on
every
possible
occasion
that
god
was
good
and
and
that
not
one
sparrow
and
now
lie
was
threatened
threatened
most
desperately
cole
was
so
ill
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
would
live
through
the
night
he
was
completely
helpless
he
had
turned
from
one
side
to
another
simply
demanding
an
assurance
from
someone
or
something
that
she
could
not
be
taken
from
him
no
one
could
give
him
that
assurance
life
without
her
would
be
impossible
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
about
the
simplest
matter
life
without
her
oh
but
it
was
incredible
like
a
blind
man
he
had
groped
his
way
up
to
the
schoolroom
he
did
not
want
to
see
the
children
nor
miss
jones
but
he
must
be
moving
must
be
doing
something
that
would
break
in
upon
that
terrible
ominous
pause
that
the
whole
world
seemed
to
him
at
this
moment
to
be
making
then
he
saw
jeremy
he
said
oh
where
miss
jones
she
in
the
next
room
said
jeremy
looking
at
his
father
oh
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
schoolroom
jeremy
left
his
toy
village
and
stood
up
is
mother
better
father
he
stopped
in
his
walk
and
looked
at
the
boy
as
though
he
were
trying
to
recollect
who
he
was
no
no
that
is
no
my
boy
i
afraid
is
she
very
bad
father
like
the
dean
wife
when
she
had
fever
his
father
did
answer
he
walked
to
the
end
of
the
room
then
turned
suddenly
as
though
he
had
seen
something
there
that
terrified
him
and
hurried
from
the
room
jeremy
suddenly
left
alone
had
a
desperate
impulse
to
scream
that
someone
must
come
that
he
was
frightened
that
something
horrible
was
in
the
house
he
stood
up
staring
at
the
closed
door
his
face
white
his
eyes
large
and
full
of
fear
then
he
flung
himself
down
by
hamlet
and
taking
him
by
the
neck
whispered
i
frightened
i
frightened
bark
or
something
there
someone
here
iii
next
morning
cole
was
still
alive
there
had
been
no
change
during
the
night
the
doctor
said
would
be
the
critical
day
was
sunday
and
cole
took
his
morning
service
at
his
church
as
usual
he
had
been
up
all
night
he
looked
haggard
and
pale
still
wearing
that
expression
as
of
a
man
lost
in
a
world
that
he
had
always
trusted
but
he
would
not
fail
in
his
duty
when
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
perhaps
god
would
hear
him
it
was
a
day
of
wonderful
heat
for
may
no
one
had
ever
remembered
so
hot
a
day
at
so
early
a
time
of
year
the
windows
of
the
church
were
open
but
no
breeze
blew
through
the
aisles
the
relentless
blazing
blue
of
the
sky
penetrated
into
the
cool
shadows
of
the
church
and
it
was
as
though
the
congregation
sat
there
under
shimmering
glass
the
waves
of
light
shifted
rose
and
fell
above
the
bonnets
and
hats
and
bare
heads
and
all
the
little
choir
boys
fell
asleep
during
the
sermon
the
cole
family
did
not
fall
asleep
they
sat
with
pale
faces
and
stiff
backs
staring
at
their
father
and
thinking
about
their
mother
mary
and
helen
were
frightened
the
house
was
so
strange
everyone
spoke
in
whispers
and
on
the
way
into
church
many
ladies
had
asked
them
how
their
mother
was
they
felt
important
as
well
as
sad
but
jeremy
did
not
feel
important
he
had
not
heard
the
ladies
and
their
questions
he
would
not
have
cared
if
he
had
people
had
always
called
him
a
queer
little
boy
simply
because
he
was
independent
and
thought
more
than
he
spoke
nevertheless
he
had
always
in
reality
been
normal
enough
until
now
he
was
really
queer
was
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
the
existence
of
a
world
whose
adjacence
to
the
real
world
was
in
after
days
to
trouble
him
so
often
and
to
complicate
life
for
him
so
grievously
the
terror
that
had
come
down
upon
him
when
his
father
had
left
him
seemed
utterly
to
soak
through
into
the
very
heart
of
him
his
mother
was
going
to
die
unless
something
or
somebody
saved
her
what
was
dying
going
away
he
had
always
been
told
with
a
golden
harp
to
sing
hymns
in
a
foreign
country
but
the
picture
would
not
form
so
easily
there
was
silence
and
darkness
and
confusion
about
this
death
his
mother
was
going
against
her
will
and
no
one
could
tell
him
whither
she
was
going
if
he
could
only
stop
her
dying
force
god
to
leave
her
alone
to
leave
her
with
them
all
as
she
had
been
before
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
his
father
who
climbed
slowly
into
his
pulpit
and
gave
out
the
text
of
his
sermon
he
would
talk
about
the
sacrifice
of
isaac
abraham
as
his
hearers
would
remember
and
so
on
jeremy
listened
and
gradually
there
grew
before
his
eyes
the
figure
of
a
strange
and
terrible
god
this
was
no
new
figure
he
had
never
thought
directly
about
god
but
for
a
very
long
time
now
he
had
had
him
in
the
background
of
his
life
as
polchester
town
hall
was
in
the
background
but
now
he
definitely
and
actively
figured
to
himself
this
god
this
god
who
was
taking
his
mother
away
and
was
intending
apparently
to
put
her
into
some
dark
place
where
she
would
know
nobody
it
must
be
some
horrible
place
because
his
father
looked
so
frightened
which
he
would
not
look
if
his
mother
was
simply
going
with
a
golden
harp
to
sing
hymns
jeremy
had
always
heard
that
this
god
was
loving
and
kind
and
tender
but
the
figure
whom
his
father
was
now
drawing
for
the
benefit
of
the
congregation
was
none
of
these
things
cole
spoke
of
a
god
just
and
terrible
but
a
god
who
apparently
for
the
merest
fancy
put
his
faithful
servant
to
terrible
anguish
and
distress
and
then
for
another
fancy
as
light
as
the
first
spared
him
his
sorrow
cole
emphasised
the
necessity
for
obedience
the
need
for
a
willing
surrender
of
anything
that
may
be
dear
to
us
because
the
love
of
god
must
be
greater
than
anything
that
holds
us
here
on
but
jeremy
did
not
listen
to
these
remarks
his
mind
was
filled
with
this
picture
of
a
vast
shadowy
figure
seated
in
the
sky
his
white
beard
flowing
beneath
eyes
that
frowned
from
dark
rocky
eyebrows
out
upon
people
like
jeremy
who
although
doing
their
best
were
nevertheless
at
the
mercy
of
any
whim
that
he
might
have
this
terrible
figure
was
the
author
of
the
hot
day
author
of
the
silent
house
and
the
shimmering
darkened
church
author
of
the
decision
to
take
his
mother
away
from
all
that
she
loved
and
put
her
somewhere
where
she
would
be
alone
and
cold
and
silent
simply
because
he
wishes
from
this
beautiful
passage
concluded
cole
we
learn
that
god
is
just
and
merciful
but
that
he
demands
our
obedience
we
must
be
ready
at
any
instant
to
give
up
what
we
love
most
and
best
afterwards
they
all
trooped
out
into
the
splendid
sunshine
iv
there
was
a
horrible
sunday
dinner
when
the
silence
and
the
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
and
the
quivering
with
heat
emphasised
every
minute
of
the
solemn
ticking
clock
mary
suddenly
burst
into
tears
choked
over
a
glass
of
water
and
was
led
from
the
room
jeremy
ate
his
beef
and
rice
pudding
in
silence
except
that
once
or
twice
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
whispered
pass
the
mustard
please
or
pass
the
salt
miss
jones
watching
his
white
face
and
the
tremble
of
his
upper
lip
longed
to
say
something
to
comfort
him
but
wisely
held
her
peace
after
dinner
jeremy
collected
hamlet
and
went
to
the
conservatory
this
like
so
many
other
english
conservatories
was
a
desolate
and
desperate
little
place
where
boxes
of
sand
dry
bulbs
and
an
unhappy
plant
or
two
languished
forgotten
and
forlorn
it
had
been
inherited
with
the
house
many
years
ago
and
at
first
the
coles
had
had
the
ambition
to
make
it
blaze
with
colour
to
grow
there
the
most
marvellous
grapes
the
richest
tomatoes
and
even
although
it
was
a
little
out
of
place
in
the
house
of
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
the
most
sinister
of
orchids
very
quickly
the
little
conservatory
had
been
abandoned
the
heating
apparatus
had
failed
the
plants
had
refused
to
grow
the
tomatoes
never
appeared
the
bulbs
would
not
burst
into
colour
for
jeremy
the
place
had
had
always
an
indescribable
fascination
when
he
was
very
young
there
had
been
absolute
trust
that
things
would
grow
that
every
kind
of
wonder
might
spring
before
one
eyes
at
any
moment
of
the
day
then
when
no
wonder
came
there
had
been
the
thrill
of
the
empty
boxes
of
earth
the
probing
with
one
fingers
to
see
what
the
bulbs
would
be
and
watching
the
fronds
of
the
pale
vine
afterwards
there
was
another
fascination
the
fascination
of
some
strange
and
sinister
atmosphere
that
he
was
much
too
young
to
define
the
place
he
knew
was
different
from
the
rest
of
the
house
it
projected
conventionally
enough
from
the
but
the
heavy
door
with
thick
windows
of
red
glass
shut
it
off
from
the
whole
world
its
rather
dirty
and
obscure
windows
looked
over
the
same
country
that
jeremy
bedroom
window
commanded
it
also
caught
all
the
sun
so
that
in
the
summer
it
was
terribly
hot
but
jeremy
loved
the
heat
he
was
discovered
once
by
the
scandalised
jampot
quite
naked
dancing
on
the
wooden
boards
his
face
and
hands
black
with
grime
no
one
could
ever
understand
what
he
saw
in
the
dirty
place
and
at
one
time
he
had
been
forbidden
to
go
there
then
he
had
cried
and
stamped
and
shouted
so
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
return
amongst
the
things
that
he
saw
there
were
the
reflections
that
the
outside
world
made
upon
the
glass
it
would
be
stained
sometimes
with
a
strange
green
reflection
of
the
fields
beyond
the
wall
sometimes
it
would
catch
the
blue
of
the
sky
or
the
red
and
gold
of
the
setting
sun
sometimes
it
would
be
grey
with
waving
shadows
across
its
surface
as
though
one
were
under
water
through
the
dirty
windows
the
country
on
fine
days
shone
like
distant
tapestry
and
in
the
glass
that
covered
the
farther
side
of
the
place
strange
reflections
were
caught
of
cows
horses
walls
and
trees
as
though
in
a
kind
of
magic
mirror
another
thing
that
jeremy
felt
there
was
that
he
was
in
a
glass
cage
swinging
over
the
whole
world
if
one
shut
one
eyes
one
could
easily
fancy
that
one
was
swinging
out
swinging
swinging
and
that
suddenly
perhaps
the
cage
would
be
detached
from
the
house
and
go
sailing
like
a
magic
carpet
to
arabia
and
persia
and
anywhere
you
pleased
to
command
the
glass
burnt
like
fire
and
the
green
fields
came
floating
up
to
be
transfigured
there
like
running
water
the
house
was
utterly
still
the
red
glass
door
shut
off
the
world
jeremy
sat
his
arms
tightly
round
hamlet
neck
on
the
dirty
floor
a
strange
mixture
of
misery
weariness
fright
and
anger
there
was
already
in
him
a
strain
of
impatience
so
that
he
could
not
bear
simply
to
sit
down
and
bewail
something
as
for
instance
both
his
sisters
were
doing
at
this
moment
he
must
act
they
could
not
bo
happy
without
their
mother
he
himself
wanted
her
so
badly
that
even
now
there
in
the
flaming
conservatory
if
he
had
allowed
himself
to
do
such
a
thing
he
would
have
sat
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
but
he
was
not
going
to
cry
mary
and
helen
could
cry
they
were
girls
he
was
going
to
do
something
as
he
sat
there
getting
hotter
and
hotter
there
grew
larger
and
larger
before
his
eyes
the
figure
of
terrible
god
that
image
of
someone
of
a
vast
size
sitting
in
the
sky
his
white
beard
flowing
his
eyes
frowning
grew
ever
more
and
more
awful
jeremy
stared
up
into
the
glass
his
eyes
blinking
the
sweat
beginning
to
pour
down
his
nose
and
yet
his
body
shivering
with
terror
but
he
had
strung
himself
up
to
meet
him
somehow
he
was
going
to
save
his
mother
and
hinder
her
departure
at
an
instant
inside
him
he
was
crying
i
want
my
mother
i
want
my
mother
like
a
little
boy
who
had
been
left
in
the
street
and
at
the
other
you
sha
have
her
you
sha
have
her
as
though
someone
were
trying
to
steal
his
or
hamlet
away
from
him
his
sleepy
bemused
heated
brain
wandered
in
dazed
fashion
back
to
his
father
sermon
of
that
morning
abraham
and
isaac
abraham
and
isaac
abraham
and
isaac
suddenly
as
though
through
the
flaming
glass
something
had
been
flung
to
him
an
idea
came
perhaps
god
that
huge
ugly
god
was
teasing
the
coles
just
as
once
he
had
teased
abraham
perhaps
he
wished
to
see
whether
they
were
truly
obedient
as
the
jampot
had
sometimes
wished
in
the
old
days
he
was
only
it
might
be
pretending
perhaps
he
was
demanding
that
one
of
them
should
give
up
something
something
of
great
value
even
jeremy
himself
if
he
had
to
sacrifice
something
to
save
his
mother
what
would
be
the
hardest
sacrifice
would
it
be
his
or
mary
or
helen
or
his
soldiers
or
his
or
his
gold
fish
that
he
had
in
a
bowl
or
no
of
course
he
had
known
from
the
first
what
would
be
hardest
it
would
of
course
be
hamlet
at
this
stage
in
his
thinking
he
removed
his
arm
from
hamlet
neck
and
looked
at
the
animal
at
the
same
moment
the
light
that
had
filled
the
with
a
fiery
radiance
that
burnt
to
the
very
heart
of
the
place
was
clouded
above
in
the
sky
black
smoky
clouds
rolling
in
fold
after
fold
as
though
some
demon
were
flinging
them
out
across
the
sky
as
one
flings
a
carpet
piled
up
and
up
each
one
darker
than
the
last
the
light
vanished
the
conservatory
was
filled
with
a
thick
murky
glow
and
far
across
the
fields
from
the
heart
of
the
black
wood
came
the
low
rumble
of
thunder
but
jeremy
did
not
hear
that
he
was
busy
with
his
thoughts
he
stared
at
the
dog
who
was
lying
stretched
out
on
the
dirty
floor
his
nose
between
his
toes
it
can
not
truthfully
be
said
that
the
resolve
that
was
forming
in
jeremy
head
had
its
birth
in
any
fine
noble
idealisms
it
was
as
though
some
bully
seizing
his
best
marbles
had
said
i
give
you
these
back
if
you
hand
over
this
week
his
attitude
to
the
bully
could
not
truthfully
be
described
as
one
of
homage
or
reverence
rather
was
it
one
of
anger
and
impotent
rebellion
he
loved
hamlet
and
he
loved
his
mother
more
than
hamlet
but
he
was
not
moved
by
sentiment
grimly
his
legs
apart
his
eyes
shut
tight
as
they
were
when
he
said
his
prayers
he
made
his
challenge
i
give
you
hamlet
if
you
do
take
mother
a
pause
only
i
cut
hamlet
throat
but
i
could
lose
him
if
that
would
only
you
must
take
him
now
i
could
do
it
his
voice
began
to
tremble
he
was
frightened
he
could
feel
behind
his
closed
eyes
that
the
darkness
had
gathered
the
place
seemed
to
be
filled
with
rolling
smoke
and
the
house
was
so
terribly
still
he
said
again
you
can
take
hamlet
he
my
best
thing
you
can
you
can
there
followed
then
with
the
promptitude
of
a
most
admirably
managed
theatrical
climax
a
peal
of
thunder
that
seemed
to
strike
the
house
with
the
iron
hand
of
a
giant
two
more
came
and
then
for
a
second
a
silence
more
deadly
than
all
the
earlier
havoc
jeremy
felt
that
god
had
leapt
upon
him
he
opened
his
eyes
turned
as
though
to
run
and
then
saw
with
a
freezing
check
upon
the
very
beat
of
his
heart
that
hamlet
was
gone
v
there
was
no
hamlet
in
that
second
of
frantic
unreasoning
terror
he
received
a
conviction
of
god
that
no
rationalistic
training
in
later
years
was
able
to
remove
there
was
no
hamlet
only
the
dusky
dirty
place
with
a
black
world
beyond
it
with
a
rush
as
of
a
thousand
whips
slashing
the
air
the
rain
came
down
upon
the
glass
jeremy
turned
crying
mother
mother
i
want
mother
and
flung
himself
at
the
red
glass
doors
fumbling
in
his
terror
for
the
handle
he
felt
as
though
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
such
a
panic
had
seized
him
as
only
belongs
to
the
most
desperate
of
nightmares
god
had
answered
him
hamlet
was
gone
and
in
a
moment
jeremy
himself
might
be
seized
he
felt
frantically
for
the
door
he
beat
upon
the
glass
he
cried
mother
mother
mother
he
had
found
the
door
but
just
as
he
turned
the
handle
he
was
aware
of
a
new
sound
heard
distantly
through
the
rain
looking
back
he
saw
from
behind
a
rampart
of
dusty
first
a
head
then
a
rough
tousled
body
then
a
tail
that
might
be
recognised
amongst
all
the
tails
of
christendom
hamlet
who
had
trained
himself
to
meet
with
a
fine
natural
show
of
bravery
every
possible
violence
save
only
thunder
crept
ashamed
dirty
and
smiling
towards
his
master
god
had
only
played
his
trick
abraham
and
isaac
after
all
then
with
a
fine
sense
of
victory
and
defiance
jeremy
turned
back
looked
up
at
the
slashing
rain
gazed
out
upon
the
black
country
at
last
seized
hamlet
and
dragging
him
out
by
his
knelt
there
in
the
dust
and
suffered
himself
to
be
licked
until
his
face
was
as
though
a
snail
had
crossed
over
it
the
thunder
passed
blue
pushed
up
into
the
grey
a
cool
air
blew
through
the
world
nevertheless
deep
in
his
heart
the
terror
remained
in
that
moment
he
had
met
god
face
to
face
he
had
delivered
his
first
challenge
to
the
incredulous
and
cynical
of
heart
authoritative
evidence
can
be
shown
to
prove
that
it
was
on
the
evening
of
that
sunday
that
cole
turned
the
corner
towards
recovery
chapter
viii
to
cow
farm
i
this
next
episode
in
jeremy
year
has
be
it
thoroughly
understood
no
plot
nor
climax
to
it
it
is
simply
the
chronicle
of
an
odyssey
nor
can
it
be
said
to
have
been
anything
but
a
very
ordinary
odyssey
to
the
outside
observer
who
if
he
be
a
parent
will
tell
you
that
going
to
the
seaside
with
the
family
is
the
most
bothering
thing
in
the
world
and
if
he
is
a
bachelor
or
old
maid
will
tell
you
that
being
in
the
same
carriage
with
other
people
children
who
are
going
to
the
sea
is
an
abominable
business
and
the
law
ought
to
have
something
to
say
to
it
all
through
may
june
and
july
cole
slowly
pulled
back
to
something
like
her
natural
health
the
new
infant
barbara
by
name
was
as
strong
as
a
pony
and
kicked
and
screamed
and
roared
so
that
the
house
was
quite
a
new
place
her
arrival
had
done
a
great
deal
for
helen
whose
gaze
had
hitherto
been
concentrated
entirely
upon
herself
now
she
suddenly
discovered
a
new
element
in
life
and
it
was
found
that
she
was
ideal
with
a
baby
and
a
great
help
to
this
made
her
more
human
and
barbara
realising
as
babies
always
do
who
understands
and
who
does
not
would
behave
with
helen
when
she
would
behave
with
no
one
else
mary
could
not
be
expected
to
transfer
her
allegiance
from
jeremy
and
then
barbara
was
frightened
at
her
spectacles
jeremy
having
hamlet
did
not
need
a
baby
there
came
a
fine
hot
morning
towards
the
end
of
july
when
miss
jones
said
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
history
lesson
saturday
week
we
go
to
jeremy
choked
kicked
mary
under
the
table
and
was
generally
impossible
during
the
rest
of
the
morning
it
was
miss
fault
she
should
have
chosen
her
occasion
more
carefully
before
the
evening
jeremy
was
standing
in
the
corner
for
drawing
on
his
bedroom
enormous
figures
in
the
blackest
of
black
lead
these
were
to
mark
the
days
that
remained
before
saturday
week
and
it
was
jeremy
maintained
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
do
and
did
hurt
the
old
which
was
dirty
enough
anyway
and
mother
had
said
long
ago
he
should
have
a
new
one
meanwhile
impossible
to
describe
what
jeremy
felt
about
it
each
year
cow
farm
and
rafiel
had
grown
more
wonderful
this
was
now
the
fifth
that
would
welcome
them
there
at
first
the
horizon
had
been
limited
by
physical
incapacity
then
the
third
year
had
been
rainy
and
the
fourth
ah
the
fourth
there
had
been
very
little
the
matter
with
that
but
this
would
be
better
yet
for
one
thing
there
had
never
been
such
a
summer
as
this
year
was
providing
a
little
rain
at
night
a
little
breeze
at
the
hottest
hour
of
the
day
everything
arranged
on
purpose
for
jeremy
comfort
and
then
although
he
did
not
know
it
this
was
to
be
truly
the
wonderful
summer
for
him
because
after
this
he
would
be
a
schoolboy
and
as
is
well
known
schoolboys
believe
in
nothing
save
what
they
can
see
with
their
own
eyes
and
are
told
by
other
boys
physically
stronger
than
themselves
five
or
six
days
before
the
great
departure
he
began
to
worry
himself
about
his
box
two
years
ago
he
had
been
given
a
little
imitation
green
canvas
luggage
box
exactly
like
his
father
except
that
this
one
was
light
enough
to
carry
in
one
hand
jeremy
adored
this
box
and
would
have
taken
it
out
with
him
had
he
been
permitted
on
all
his
walks
but
he
had
a
way
of
filling
it
with
heavy
stones
and
then
asking
miss
jones
to
carry
it
for
him
it
had
therefore
been
forbidden
but
he
would
of
course
take
it
with
him
to
cow
farm
and
it
should
contain
all
the
things
that
he
loved
best
at
first
all
the
things
that
he
loved
best
had
not
seemed
so
very
numerous
there
would
first
of
all
of
course
be
the
hottentot
a
black
and
battered
clown
for
whom
he
had
long
ceased
to
feel
any
affection
but
he
was
compelled
by
an
irritating
sense
of
loyalty
to
include
it
in
the
party
just
as
his
mother
might
include
some
tiresome
old
maid
because
she
had
nowhere
to
go
to
poor
after
the
hottentot
there
would
be

all
and
yet
some
of
it
he
must
have
and
noah
and
the
church
perhaps
or
no
monk
would
want
to
see
the
garden
it
would
never
do
not
to
show
her
the
orchard
with
the
and
then
the
youngest
miss
noah
she
had
always
seemed
to
jeremy
so
attractive
with
her
straight
blue
gown
and
hard
red
cheeks
he
must
show
her
to
monk
and
the
butcher
shop
and
then
the
sheep
and
the
dogs
and
the
cows
he
was
truly
in
despair
he
sat
on
the
schoolroom
floor
with
his
possessions
all
around
him
only
helen
was
in
the
room
and
he
knew
that
it
would
be
no
use
to
appeal
to
her
she
had
become
so
much
more
conceited
since
barbara
arrival
and
yet
he
must
appeal
to
somebody
so
he
said
to
her
very
politely
please
helen
i
got
my
box
and
so
many
things
to
put
into
it
and
it
nearly
saturday
already
and
i
want
to
show
the
noahs
to
this
would
have
been
a
difficult
sentence
for
the
most
person
to
unravel
and
helen
was
at
that
moment
trying
to
write
a
letter
to
an
aunt
whom
she
had
never
seen
and
for
whom
she
had
no
sort
of
affection
so
she
answered
him
rather
roughly
oh
do
bother
with
your
box
jeremy
ca
you
see
i
busy
you
may
be
busy
said
jeremy
rising
indignantly
to
his
feet
but
busy
too
and
my
business
is
just
as
good
as
yours
with
your
silly
old
oh
do
bother
said
helen
whereupon
jeremy
crept
behind
her
and
pinched
her
stocking
a
battle
followed
too
commonplace
in
its
details
to
demand
description
here
it
need
only
be
said
that
hamlet
joined
in
it
and
ran
away
with
helen
letter
which
had
blown
to
the
ground
during
the
struggle
and
that
he
ate
it
in
his
corner
with
great
satisfaction
then
when
they
were
at
their
angriest
helen
suddenly
began
to
laugh
which
she
did
sometimes
to
her
own
intense
annoyance
when
she
terribly
wanted
to
be
enraged
then
jeremy
laughed
too
and
hamlet
yielded
up
fragments
of
the
letter
so
that
all
was
well
but
the
problem
of
the
box
was
not
solved
and
in
the
end
the
only
part
of
the
toy
village
that
monk
ever
saw
was
the
youngest
miss
noah
and
one
for
her
to
sit
under
ii
the
ritual
of
the
journey
to
cow
farm
was
by
this
time
of
course
firmly
established
and
the
first
part
of
the
ritual
was
that
one
should
wake
up
at
three
in
the
morning
this
year
however
for
some
strange
mysterious
reason
jeremy
overslept
himself
and
did
not
wake
up
until
eight
to
find
then
that
everyone
was
already
busy
packing
and
brushing
and
rushing
about
and
that
all
his
own
most
sacred
preparations
must
be
squeezed
into
no
time
at
all
if
he
were
to
be
ready
old
tom
collins
bus
came
along
at
twelve
to
catch
the
one
train
so
that
jeremy
might
be
considered
to
have
the
whole
morning
for
his
labours
but
that
was
not
going
to
be
enough
for
him
unless
he
was
very
careful
people
had
such
a
way
of
suddenly
catching
on
to
you
and
washing
your
ears
or
making
you
brush
your
teeth
or
sitting
you
down
in
a
corner
with
a
book
that
circumnavigating
them
and
outplotting
them
needed
as
much
nerve
and
enterprise
as
tracking
red
indians
when
things
were
fined
down
to
the
most
naked
accuracy
he
had
apparently
only
two
jobs
one
to
accustom
hamlet
to
walking
with
a
lead
the
other
to
close
the
green
box
but
of
course
mary
would
want
advice
and
there
would
in
all
probability
be
a
dispute
or
two
about
property
that
would
take
up
the
time
it
was
indeed
an
eventful
morning
trouble
began
with
mary
suddenly
discovering
that
she
had
lost
her
copy
of
alice
in
wonderland
and
rushing
to
jeremy
box
and
upsetting
all
jeremy
things
to
see
whether
it
were
there
jeremy
objected
to
this
with
an
indignation
that
was
scarcely
in
the
sequel
justified
because
mary
found
the
book
jammed
against
the
and
a
dry
walnut
nestling
in
its
centre
she
cried
and
protested
and
then
suddenly
with
the
disgusting
sentimentality
that
was
so
characteristic
of
her
abandoned
her
position
altogether
and
said
that
jeremy
could
have
it
and
then
cried
again
because
he
said
he
did
want
it
then
jeremy
had
to
put
everything
back
into
the
box
again
and
in
the
middle
of
this
hamlet
ran
off
with
the
miss
noah
between
his
teeth
and
began
to
lick
the
blue
off
her
dress
looking
up
at
the
assembled
company
between
every
lick
with
a
smile
of
the
loveliest
satisfaction
then
when
the
box
was
almost
closed
it
was
discovered
by
a
shocked
and
virtuous
helen
that
jeremy
had
left
out
his
bible
there
be
one
there
said
jeremy
in
an
angry
agitated
whisper
hoping
to
escape
the
attention
of
miss
jones
what
that
jeremy
dear
said
miss
jones
oh
fancy
miss
jones
said
helen
he
taking
all
his
dirty
old
toys
and
even
his
old
clown
and
he
leaving
out
his
i
not
cried
jeremy
taking
it
and
trying
to
squeeze
it
down
between
three
walnuts
and
the
toy
pistol
oh
jeremy
clear
that
not
the
way
to
treat
your
bible
i
give
you
some
paper
to
wrap
it
up
in
and
you
better
take
the
things
out
again
and
put
it
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
yes
obviously
he
would
not
be
ready
in
time
the
matter
of
hamlet
and
the
lead
was
also
very
exhausting
hamlet
had
never
in
all
his
days
been
tied
to
anyone
or
anything
of
course
no
one
could
tell
what
had
been
his
history
before
he
came
strolling
on
to
the
cole
horizon
and
it
may
be
that
once
as
a
very
small
puppy
he
had
been
tied
on
to
something
on
the
whole
that
is
probable
his
protests
on
this
occasion
being
of
a
kind
so
vehement
as
to
argue
some
reminiscences
behind
them
cole
had
bought
a
beautiful
lead
of
black
leather
of
course
he
had
already
a
collar
studded
with
little
silver
nails
and
the
point
was
very
simply
to
fasten
the
lead
on
to
the
collar
jeremy
had
been
promised
that
he
should
conduct
hamlet
and
it
had
seemed
when
the
promise
had
been
made
as
though
it
would
be
a
very
simple
thing
to
carry
out
hamlet
no
sooner
saw
the
cord
than
he
began
his
ingenious
protests
sitting
up
and
smiling
at
it
suddenly
darting
at
the
recumbent
miss
noah
and
rushing
round
the
room
with
her
finally
catching
the
lead
itself
in
his
teeth
and
hiding
with
it
under
miss
jones
skirt
the
result
was
that
tom
collins
bus
arrived
when
no
one
in
the
schoolroom
was
in
the
least
prepared
for
it
then
what
confusion
there
was
cole
looking
strange
in
her
hat
and
veil
as
though
she
were
dressed
up
for
a
play
came
urging
them
to
hurry
because
father
was
then
hamlet
tied
himself
and
his
lead
round
the
leg
of
the
table
then
mary
said
in
her
most
tiresome
manner
apropos
of
nothing
at
all
you
do
love
me
jeremy
do
you
just
at
the
moment
when
he
was
trying
to
unlace
hamlet
and
her
lip
began
to
tremble
when
he
said
oh
do
bother
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
add
of
course
i
do
then
father
came
running
up
the
stairs
with
really
this
is
too
disgraceful
we
shall
miss
that
train
then
uncle
samuel
appeared
looking
so
queer
that
jeremy
was
compelled
to
stare
at
him
jeremy
had
seen
very
little
of
uncle
samuel
during
these
last
months
he
had
hoped
after
that
wonderful
adventure
of
the
christmas
pantomime
that
they
were
going
to
be
friends
but
it
had
not
been
so
he
had
been
away
somewhere
in
some
strange
place
painting
and
then
on
his
return
he
had
hid
himself
and
his
odd
affairs
away
in
some
corner
of
the
house
where
no
one
saw
him
he
had
had
his
life
and
jeremy
had
had
his
nevertheless
jeremy
was
delighted
to
see
him
it
would
be
fun
to
have
him
at
cow
farm
with
his
squashy
brown
hat
his
fat
cheeks
his
blue
painting
smock
and
his
short
legs
with
huge
boots
he
was
different
in
some
way
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
jeremy
even
at
that
early
stage
of
his
education
already
perceived
that
he
could
learn
more
from
uncle
samuel
than
from
any
other
member
of
the
family
now
he
put
his
head
in
through
the
door
and
said
well
you
kids
are
you
ready
it
time
then
seeing
miss
jones
he
said
good
morning
and
bolted
like
a
rabbit
even
then
jeremy
noticed
that
he
had
paint
on
his
fingers
and
that
two
of
his
waistcoat
buttons
were
unfastened
then
down
in
the
hall
what
confusion
there
was
boxes
here
there
and
everywhere
mother
father
aunt
amy
uncle
samuel
and
most
interesting
of
all
barbara
and
the
new
nurse
the
new
nurse
was
called
pateham
and
she
was
stout
and
smiling
the
bundle
in
white
called
barbara
was
most
happily
sleeping
but
hamlet
barked
at
pateham
and
that
woke
barbara
who
began
to
cry
then
collins
came
in
with
his
coat
off
and
the
muscles
swelling
on
his
shoulders
and
handled
the
boxes
as
though
they
were
paper
and
the
cook
and
rose
and
william
the
and
old
jordan
the
gardener
and
preston
a
lady
from
two
doors
down
who
sometimes
came
in
to
help
all
began
to
bob
and
smile
and
father
said
now
my
dear
now
my
dear
and
hamlet
wound
himself
and
his
lead
round
everything
that
he
could
see
and
helen
fussed
and
said
now
jeremy
and
miss
jones
said
now
children
and
last
of
all
collins
said
now
mum
now
sir
and
then
they
all
were
bundled
into
the
bus
with
the
cart
and
the
luggage
coming
along
behind
the
drive
through
the
streets
was
of
course
as
lovely
as
it
could
be
not
in
the
least
because
anyone
could
see
anything
that
was
hindered
by
the
fact
that
the
windows
of
the
bus
were
so
old
that
they
were
crusted
with
a
kind
of
glassy
mildew
and
no
amount
of
rubbing
on
the
provided
one
with
a
view
but
because
the
inside
of
the
bus
was
inevitably
connected
with
adventure
partly
through
its
motion
partly
through
its
noise
and
partly
through
its
lovely
smell
these
were
of
course
jeremy
views
and
it
ca
definitely
be
asserted
that
all
people
shared
them
but
whenever
jeremy
had
ridden
in
that
bus
he
had
always
been
on
his
way
to
something
delightful
the
motion
therefore
rejoiced
his
heart
although
the
violence
of
it
was
such
that
everyone
was
thrown
against
everyone
else
so
that
uncle
samuel
was
suddenly
hurled
against
the
bonnet
of
miss
jones
and
helen
struck
aunt
amy
in
the
chest
and
jeremy
himself
dived
into
his
sister
barbara
as
to
the
smell
it
was
that
lovely
one
that
has
in
it
mice
and
straw
wet
umbrellas
and
whisky
goloshes
and
dust
and
green
paint
jeremy
loved
it
and
sniffed
on
this
occasion
so
often
that
miss
jones
told
him
to
blow
his
nose
as
to
the
noise
who
is
there
who
does
not
remember
that
rattle
and
clatter
that
sudden
deafening
report
as
of
the
firing
of
a
hundred
firearms
the
sudden
pause
when
every
bolt
and
bar
and
hinge
sighs
and
moans
like
the
wind
or
a
stormy
sea
and
then
that
sudden
scream
of
the
clattering
windows
when
it
is
as
though
a
frenzied
cook
having
received
notice
to
leave
was
breaking
every
scrap
of
china
in
the
kitchen
who
does
not
know
that
last
maddened
roar
as
the
vehicle
stumbles
across
the
last
piece
of
cobbled
road
a
roar
that
drowns
with
a
savage
and
determined
triumph
all
those
last
directions
not
to
forget
this
that
and
the
other
all
those
inquiries
as
to
whether
this
that
and
the
other
had
been
remembered
cobbles
are
gone
now
and
old
buses
sleep
in
deserted
courts
and
collins
alas
is
not
his
youngest
son
has
a
and
polchester
has
asphalt
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
jeremy
clutching
his
green
box
with
one
hand
and
hamlet
lead
with
the
other
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
the
louder
the
noise
the
rocking
motion
the
stronger
the
smell
the
better
is
it
lovely
he
murmured
to
miss
jones
during
one
of
the
pauses
it
may
be
that
it
was
at
this
moment
that
uncle
samuel
finally
made
up
his
mind
about
jeremy
in
spite
of
his
dislike
even
hatred
of
children
he
had
been
coming
slowly
during
the
last
two
years
to
an
affection
for
and
interest
in
his
nephew
that
was
something
quite
new
to
his
cynical
egoistic
nature
it
had
leapt
into
activity
at
christmas
time
then
had
died
again
now
as
flung
first
into
his
sister
bony
arms
then
on
to
the
terrified
spectacles
of
his
niece
mary
he
tried
to
recover
himself
he
was
caught
and
held
by
that
picture
of
his
small
nephew
seated
solid
and
square
in
his
blue
sailor
suit
his
bare
knees
swinging
his
hand
clutching
his
precious
box
with
an
energy
that
defied
fate
itself
to
take
it
from
him
his
mouth
set
his
eyes
staring
radiant
with
joy
in
front
of
him
on
arrival
at
the
station
it
was
found
that
the
one
to
liskane
was
just
about
due
so
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
they
had
to
rush
along
under
the
great
iron
dome
passing
by
the
main
line
disregarding
the
tempestuous
express
from
truxe
that
drew
up
as
it
were
disdainfully
just
as
they
passed
and
finding
the
modest
side
line
to
liskane
and
lowe
here
there
was
every
kind
of
excitement
for
jeremy
anyone
who
has
any
kind
of
passion
for
observation
must
have
discovered
long
ago
that
a
side
line
has
ever
so
much
more
charm
and
appeal
about
it
than
a
main
line
a
main
line
is
scornful
of
the
station
in
whose
heart
it
consents
for
a
moment
to
linger
its
eyes
are
staring
forward
towards
the
vast
cities
who
are
impatiently
awaiting
it
but
a
side
line
has
its
very
home
here
so
much
gossip
passes
from
day
to
day
above
its
rails
and
gossip
that
has
for
its
circumference
five
green
fields
a
country
road
and
a
babbling
brook
that
it
knows
all
its
passengers
by
heart
to
the
people
who
travel
on
a
side
line
the
train
itself
is
still
something
of
a
wonder
how
much
more
was
that
true
thirty
years
ago
on
this
especial
line
there
were
only
two
and
lowe
and
of
a
certainty
these
stations
would
not
even
now
be
in
existence
were
it
not
that
lowe
was
a
fishing
centre
of
very
great
importance
the
little
district
that
comprehended
lowe
garth
in
roselands
stoep
in
roselands
rafiel
and
all
the
smaller
hamlets
around
them
was
fed
by
this
line
but
even
so
the
little
train
was
never
crowded
tourists
did
not
and
even
now
do
not
go
to
polwint
and
lowe
because
they
smell
so
fishy
nor
to
rafield
because
too
far
from
the
railway
nor
to
the
roseland
valleys
because
nothing
to
see
may
these
reasons
hold
good
for
many
years
to
come
today
there
were
three
farmers
in
brown
leggings
with
pipes
and
thick
knotted
two
or
three
women
with
baskets
and
a
child
or
so
and
an
amiable
clergyman
in
a
black
cloth
so
faded
that
it
was
now
green
reading
the
times
and
shaking
his
head
over
it
as
he
stumbled
up
and
down
the
platform
one
of
the
farmers
had
a
large
woolly
who
of
course
excited
hamlet
to
a
frenzy
jeremy
therefore
had
his
time
fully
occupied
in
checking
this
but
he
had
nevertheless
the
opportunity
to
observe
how
one
of
the
farmers
puffed
the
smoke
out
of
his
cheeks
as
though
he
were
an
engine
how
one
of
the
women
with
a
back
as
broad
as
a
wall
had
red
stockings
and
how
the
clergyman
nearly
fell
on
to
the
every
time
he
turned
round
and
only
saved
himself
from
disaster
by
a
miracle
the
train
arriving
at
last
they
all
climbed
into
it
and
then
had
to
wait
for
a
hot
grilling
whilst
the
engine
made
up
its
mind
that
it
was
worth
its
while
to
take
all
the
trouble
to
start
off
again
an
hour
late
upon
my
word
said
cole
angrily
when
at
last
with
a
snore
and
a
heave
and
a
grunt
and
a
scream
they
started
really
too
bad
i
shall
have
to
complain
which
as
everyone
present
knew
he
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
in
jeremy
carriage
there
were
his
father
his
mother
uncle
samuel
himself
mary
and
of
course
hamlet
hamlet
had
never
been
in
a
train
before
and
his
terror
at
the
way
that
the
ground
quivered
under
him
was
pitiful
to
see
he
lay
first
under
the
seat
trying
to
hold
himself
tightly
together
then
when
that
failed
he
made
startled
frenzied
leaps
on
to
laps
the
lead
had
been
removed
for
the
time
finally
he
cowered
up
into
the
corner
behind
uncle
samuel
who
seemed
to
understand
his
case
and
sympathised
with
it
whenever
the
train
stopped
which
being
a
glebeshire
train
it
did
continually
he
recovered
at
once
his
asserted
his
dignity
gazed
through
the
windows
at
the
fields
and
cows
as
though
he
owned
them
all
and
barked
with
the
friendly
greeting
of
comrade
to
comrade
whenever
he
saw
another
dog
the
next
thing
that
occupied
jeremy
attention
was
lunch
many
people
despise
sandwiches
and
milk
out
of
and
bananas
and
jeremy
of
course
did
not
he
loved
anything
eaten
out
of
paper
from
the
sold
by
the
barney
man
in
polchester
square
only
once
did
he
secure
some
down
to
the
frills
that
there
are
round
the
tail
of
any
ham
but
the
paper
on
this
journey
to
rafield
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
touch
it
in
the
first
place
you
spread
newspaper
on
your
knees
then
there
was
paper
under
the
sandwiches
chicken
and
more
paper
under
the
sandwiches
beef
and
still
more
under
the
sandwiches
egg
there
was
paper
round
the
and
most
wonderful
of
all
paper
round
the
with
strawberry
jam
eaten
in
the
odour
of
and
eggshells
is
it
possible
for
life
at
its
very
best
to
hold
more
he
kept
his
so
long
as
he
could
until
at
last
cole
said
now
my
boy
finish
it
up
finish
it
up
paper
out
of
the
neat
and
tidy
that
right
speaking
in
that
voice
which
jeremy
hated
because
it
was
used
so
especially
when
oil
had
to
be
taken
he
swallowed
his
puff
in
a
gulp
and
then
gazed
out
of
the
window
lamenting
its
disappearance
did
you
like
it
whispered
mary
hoarsely
you
got
some
jam
on
the
side
of
your
nose
said
jeremy
he
was
sitting
next
to
his
father
who
had
the
corner
seat
and
he
now
devoted
all
his
energies
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
asleep
against
his
father
leg
but
the
the
glazed
and
shining
fields
beyond
the
window
the
little
blobs
of
sunlight
that
danced
upon
the
floor
of
the
carriage
the
scents
of
food
and
flowers
and
the
hot
breeze
the
hum
of
the
train
and
the
dancing
of
the
telegraph
wires
all
these
things
were
against
him
his
head
began
to
nod
and
then
to
jump
back
with
a
sudden
terrible
spring
as
though
an
evil
demon
pulled
it
with
a
rope
from
behind
the
carriage
swelled
like
a
balloon
then
dwindled
into
a
thin
straight
line
the
strangest
things
happened
to
his
friends
and
relations
his
mother
who
was
reading
the
church
family
newspaper
developed
two
faces
and
a
nose
like
a
post
and
uncle
samuel
who
had
in
harsh
reality
two
chins
seemed
to
be
all
folds
and
creases
like
a
balloon
when
it
is
shivering
down
into
collapse
jeremy
fought
with
these
fantasies
the
lines
on
the
newspaper
doubled
and
redoubled
vanished
and
sprang
to
life
again
he
said
i
will
not
and
instantly
his
head
on
the
soft
part
of
his
father
thigh
was
asleep
iii
in
his
dreams
he
was
riding
on
a
cloud
all
pink
and
gold
and
behind
came
a
row
of
shining
white
clouds
fluffy
like
bales
of
wool
wrapped
round
lighted
lanterns
his
cloud
rose
and
fell
rose
and
fell
and
a
voice
said
in
his
ear
all
is
well
all
is
well
you
can
go
on
like
this
for
ever
there
will
be
soon
and
and
and
you
can
go
to
china
this
way
whenever
you
and
he
said
ca
i
take
hamlet
with
me
and
the
voice
answered
hamlet
is
with
you
already
and
there
behold
was
hamlet
sitting
on
the
pink
cloud
with
a
stiff
gold
collar
round
his
neck
wagging
his
tail
and
then
the
voice
shouted
so
loudly
that
jeremy
jumped
off
the
pink
cloud
in
his
astonishment
liskane
liskane
liskane
and
jeremy
jumped
and
fell
and
fell
right
into
his
lap
with
someone
crying
in
his
ear
wake
up
jeremy
we
there
we
there
his
first
thought
was
for
his
green
box
which
was
he
found
safely
and
securely
in
his
hand
then
for
hamlet
who
was
he
saw
with
horror
already
upon
the
platform
the
lead
trailing
behind
him
like
a
neglected
conscience
his
burning
eyes
piercing
his
hair
in
search
of
another
dog
whom
he
smelt
but
could
not
see
jeremy
rushing
out
of
the
train
seized
the
lead
scolded
his
recovered
property
who
wore
an
expression
of
injured
and
abandoned
innocence
and
looked
about
him
yes
this
was
liskane
wonderful
marvellous
magical
liskane
to
the
bored
and
cynical
adult
liskane
may
easily
appear
to
be
one
of
the
ugliest
most
deserted
stations
in
the
whole
of
europe
having
nothing
on
either
side
of
it
save
barren
grey
fields
that
never
grow
grass
but
only
stones
and
bottles
with
its
single
decoration
a
heavy
iron
bridge
that
crosses
the
rails
and
leads
up
to
the
higher
road
and
the
town
of
liskane
ugly
enough
but
to
jeremy
on
this
summer
afternoon
the
gate
to
a
sure
and
certain
paradise
although
his
family
were
fussing
around
him
barbara
crying
cole
saying
four
five
six
but
where
the
black
box
your
black
box
amy
six
seven
but
there
should
be
eight
seven
and
cole
saying
and
there
my
brown
bag
the
little
one
with
the
black
handle
and
helen
saying
oo
was
it
adidums
then
and
miss
jones
now
mary
now
jeremy
now
helen
although
this
was
going
on
just
as
it
always
had
gone
on
his
eyes
were
searching
for
the
wagonette
ah
there
it
was
he
could
just
see
the
top
of
it
beyond
the
iron
bridge
and
jim
the
man
from
the
farm
would
be
coming
down
to
help
with
the
boxes
yes
there
he
was
crossing
the
bridge
now
with
his
red
face
and
broad
shoulders
and
the
cap
on
the
side
of
his
head
just
as
he
always
wore
it
jeremy
recognised
him
with
a
strange
little
choking
sensation
it
was
coming
home
to
him
all
this
was
the
great
event
of
his
life
and
as
he
looked
at
the
others
he
realised
young
as
he
was
that
none
of
them
felt
it
as
he
did
and
the
realisation
gave
him
a
strange
feeling
half
of
gratification
half
of
loneliness
he
stood
there
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
of
them
clutching
his
box
and
holding
on
to
hamlet
lead
feeling
so
deeply
excited
that
his
heart
was
like
a
hard
cold
stone
jumping
up
and
down
bump
bump
behind
his
waistcoat
that
jim
that
jim
he
whispered
in
a
hoarse
gasp
to
miss
jones
now
mind
dear
she
answered
in
her
kindly
groping
voice
you
be
falling
on
to
the
rail
if
you
are
it
strangely
annoyed
him
that
his
father
should
greet
jim
just
as
though
he
were
some
quite
ordinary
man
in
polchester
he
himself
waited
in
a
strange
agitation
until
jim
should
notice
him
the
man
turned
at
last
bending
down
to
pick
up
a
box
saw
him
touched
his
cap
smiling
a
long
crooked
smile
and
jeremy
blushed
with
happiness
it
was
the
first
recognition
that
he
had
had
from
the
farm
and
it
pleased
him
they
all
moved
up
to
the
higher
road
uncle
samuel
coming
on
at
the
last
in
a
dreamy
moody
way
stopping
on
the
bridge
to
look
down
at
the
and
then
suddenly
saying
aloud
their
minds
are
full
of
the
number
of
boxes
and
whether
they
get
tea
and
who
to
pay
what
and
badly
i
want
a
wash
and
already
they
be
wondering
whether
they
ough
to
be
getting
home
to
polchester
all
sham
all
sham
he
was
speaking
to
jeremy
but
to
himself
however
jeremy
said
did
you
see
jim
uncle
no
i
did
he
fatter
and
redder
than
last
i
should
are
you
going
to
paint
uncle
i
what
oh
just
lines
and
jeremy
paused
standing
for
a
moment
and
looked
puzzled
then
he
said
do
you
like
babies
uncle
samuel
no
i
do
not
even
barbara
no
certainly
i
do
too
why
do
you
paint
cows
and
houses
like
other
people
uncle
samuel
i
heard
father
say
once
that
he
never
knew
what
your
pictures
that
why
i
paint
why
so
that
your
father
sha
know
what
they
although
he
did
not
understand
this
any
more
than
he
understood
his
uncle
jeremy
was
pleased
with
this
conversation
it
had
been
somehow
in
tone
with
the
place
and
the
hour
it
had
conveyed
to
him
in
some
strange
fashion
that
his
uncle
cared
for
all
of
this
rather
as
he
himself
cared
oh
he
liked
uncle
samuel
he
had
hoped
that
he
might
have
sat
on
the
box
next
to
jim
but
that
place
was
now
piled
up
with
luggage
so
he
was
squeezed
in
between
his
mother
and
patcham
with
hamlet
very
uncomfortable
between
his
knees
they
drove
off
down
the
high
road
the
hot
smell
of
the
grass
came
to
his
nostrils
the
sun
blazed
down
upon
them
turning
the
path
before
them
into
gleaming
steel
and
the
high
glebeshire
hedges
covered
with
thin
powder
rose
on
both
sides
above
them
breaking
once
and
again
to
show
the
folding
valleys
and
the
faint
blue
hills
and
the
heavy
dark
trees
with
their
thick
black
shadows
staining
the
grass
the
cows
were
clustered
sleeping
wherever
they
could
find
shadow
faintly
tinkled
in
the
distance
and
now
and
then
a
stream
like
broken
glass
floated
cried
and
was
gone
they
drove
into
a
dark
wood
and
the
sun
scattered
through
the
trees
in
pieces
of
gold
and
shadowy
streams
of
arrowed
light
the
birds
were
singing
and
whenever
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
and
the
wheels
turned
onto
soft
moss
or
lines
of
grass
in
the
sudden
silence
the
air
was
filled
with
birds
voices
that
proved
that
it
must
now
be
turning
to
the
evening
of
the
day
the
sun
was
not
very
high
above
the
wood
and
the
sea
of
blue
was
invaded
by
a
high
galleon
of
cloud
that
hovered
with
spreading
sail
catching
gold
into
its
heart
as
it
moved
they
left
the
wood
crossed
the
river
garth
and
came
out
on
to
moorland
here
for
the
first
time
jeremy
smelt
the
sea
the
lanes
had
been
hot
but
here
the
wind
blew
across
the
moor
with
the
smell
of
and
in
it
the
grass
was
short
and
rough
the
soil
was
sand
on
the
horizon
was
the
grey
melancholy
tower
of
a
deserted
mine
some
bird
flew
with
swiftly
driving
wings
crying
as
it
went
the
smell
of
the
moor
was
as
fresh
as
though
the
foot
of
man
had
never
crossed
it
deserted
but
not
alone
bare
but
not
empty
uninhabited
but
peopled
silent
but
full
of
voices
jeremy
excitement
grew
he
knew
now
how
every
line
of
the
road
would
be
they
left
the
moor
and
were
on
the
road
leading
to
rafield
these
were
the
days
before
they
built
the
road
from
liskane
wide
enough
for
and
other
horrible
inventions
thirty
years
ago
the
way
was
so
narrow
that
the
briars
and
ferns
brushed
your
face
as
you
passed
and
you
could
reach
out
your
hand
and
pluck
and
dandelions
and
many
roads
twisted
in
and
out
upon
one
another
the
corners
were
so
sharp
that
sometimes
the
wagonette
seemed
to
hang
upon
one
wheel
as
it
turned
still
no
sight
of
the
sea
but
the
smell
of
it
now
was
everywhere
and
sometimes
at
a
sudden
bend
there
would
come
a
faint
beat
beat
upon
the
ear
with
something
rhyming
and
measured
in
it
like
the
murmur
of
a
sleeping
giant
they
came
to
the
bend
where
the
hill
suddenly
dips
at
a
fearful
angle
down
into
rafield
here
they
turned
to
the
right
deep
between
edges
again
then
through
a
little
copse
and
then
as
though
with
a
whisk
of
the
finger
right
on
to
cow
farm
itself
it
was
an
old
square
house
deep
red
brick
with
crooked
chimneys
and
a
stone
court
in
front
of
it
to
either
side
of
the
court
there
were
barns
behind
the
house
thick
trees
clouded
with
green
showed
in
the
middle
of
the
court
was
a
pump
and
all
about
the
flagged
stones
pigeons
were
delicately
walking
as
they
drove
up
the
pigeons
rose
in
a
wheeling
flight
against
the
sky
now
staining
faintly
with
amber
dogs
rushed
barking
from
the
barns
a
haycart
turned
the
comer
its
wheels
creaking
and
four
little
children
perched
high
on
the
top
of
the
hay
then
the
opened
and
behold
monk
monk
and
clustering
shyly
behind
the
little
monks
in
the
scene
that
followed
jeremy
was
forgotten
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
made
him
hang
behind
the
others
but
he
stood
beside
the
wagonette
bent
down
and
released
hamlet
and
then
waited
hiding
under
the
shadow
of
the
cart
his
happiness
was
almost
intolerable
he
could
not
speak
he
could
not
move
and
in
the
heart
of
his
happiness
there
was
a
strange
unhappiness
that
he
had
never
known
before
the
loneliness
that
he
had
felt
at
liskane
station
was
intensified
so
that
he
felt
like
a
stranger
who
was
seeing
his
father
or
his
mother
or
aunt
or
sisters
for
the
first
time
everything
about
him
emphasised
the
loneliness
the
slow
evening
light
that
was
stealing
into
the
sky
the
sound
of
some
machine
in
the
turning
with
a
melancholy
rhythmic
whine
a
voice
calling
in
the
fields
the
rumble
of
the
sea
the
twittering
of
birds
in
the
garden
trees
the
bark
of
a
dog
far
far
away
and
through
them
all
the
sense
that
the
world
was
sinking
down
into
silence
and
that
all
the
sounds
were
slipping
away
like
visitors
hurrying
from
the
park
before
the
gates
are
shut
he
stood
there
listening
caught
into
a
life
that
was
utterly
his
own
and
had
no
share
with
any
other
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
they
were
all
going
into
the
house
that
jim
and
monk
were
busy
with
the
boxes
and
that
no
one
was
aware
of
him
he
knew
what
he
wanted
he
slipped
across
the
court
and
dropped
into
the
black
cavernous
hole
of
the
farther
barn
at
first
the
darkness
stopped
him
but
he
knew
his
way
found
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
loft
and
was
soon
perched
high
behind
a
little
square
window
that
was
now
blue
and
gold
against
the
velvety
blackness
behind
him
this
was
his
favourite
spot
in
all
the
farm
here
all
the
year
they
stored
the
apples
and
the
smell
of
the
fruit
was
thick
in
the
air
sweet
and
strong
clinging
about
every
fibre
of
the
place
so
that
you
could
not
disturb
a
strand
nor
a
stone
without
sending
some
new
drift
of
the
scent
up
against
your
nostrils
all
the
year
after
his
first
visit
jeremy
had
been
longing
to
smell
that
smell
again
and
now
he
knelt
up
against
the
window
drinking
it
in
with
his
eyes
he
searched
the
horizon
from
here
you
could
see
the
garden
with
the
the
fields
beyond
the
sudden
dip
with
the
trees
at
the
edge
of
it
bent
crossways
by
the
wind
and
there
in
such
a
cup
as
hands
might
form
just
beyond
was
the
sea
he
stared
as
though
his
eyes
would
start
from
his
head
behind
him
was
the
cloudy
smoke
of
the
in
front
of
him
the
sun
was
sinking
towards
the
dark
elms
soon
the
trees
would
catch
the
sun
and
hide
it
the
galleon
cloud
that
had
been
over
them
as
they
drove
was
new
banked
in
red
and
gold
across
the
horizon
birds
slowly
lazily
fled
to
their
homes
he
heard
someone
call
jeremy
jeremy
with
a
last
gaze
he
saw
the
blue
cup
turn
to
gold
the
sun
reached
the
tops
of
the
elms
the
fields
were
lit
with
the
glitter
of
shining
glass
then
even
as
he
watched
they
were
purple
then
grey
then
dim
like
smoke
again
the
voice
called
jeremy
he
slipped
from
the
window
found
the
little
stair
ran
across
the
dusky
court
and
entered
the
house
chapter
ix
the
awakening
of
charlotte
i
towards
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
stay
at
cow
farm
it
was
announced
that
very
shortly
there
would
be
a
picnic
at
rafiel
cove
jeremy
had
been
waiting
for
this
proclamation
once
or
twice
he
had
asked
whether
they
were
going
to
the
cove
and
had
been
told
not
to
bother
all
in
good
time
and
other
ridiculous
elderly
finalities
but
he
knew
that
the
day
must
come
as
it
had
always
come
every
year
the
picnic
at
rafield
was
always
the
central
event
of
the
summer
and
he
had
this
year
another
reason
for
excited
anticipation
the
wonderful
charlotte
le
page
was
to
be
present
until
now
jeremy
had
never
taken
the
slightest
interest
in
girls
mary
and
helen
being
his
sisters
were
necessities
and
inevitabilities
but
that
did
not
mean
that
he
could
not
get
along
very
easily
without
them
and
indeed
mary
with
her
jealousies
her
strange
sulky
temper
and
sudden
sentimental
repentances
was
certainly
a
burden
and
restraint
as
to
the
little
girls
in
polchester
he
had
frankly
found
them
tiresome
and
stupid
thinking
of
themselves
terrified
of
the
most
natural
phenomena
and
untruthful
in
their
statements
he
had
been
always
independent
and
reserved
with
everyone
and
bud
never
in
all
his
life
had
a
close
friend
but
there
had
been
especially
of
late
boys
with
whom
it
had
been
amusing
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
and
since
his
fight
with
the
dean
ernest
he
had
thought
that
it
would
be
rather
interesting
to
make
a
further
trial
of
strength
with
whomsoever
girls
were
stupid
uninteresting
conceited
and
slow
he
never
in
all
his
life
wanted
to
have
anything
to
do
with
girls
but
charlotte
le
page
was
another
matter
she
had
in
the
first
place
become
quite
a
tradition
in
the
cole
family
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
landowner
who
always
spent
his
holidays
in
rafiel
she
and
her
very
beautiful
very
superior
mother
had
been
seen
on
many
occasions
by
the
coles
driving
about
the
glebeshire
roads
in
a
fine
and
languid
manner
a
manner
to
which
the
coles
knew
very
well
they
themselves
could
never
attain
then
cole
had
called
and
mrs
le
page
and
charlotte
had
come
to
tea
at
cow
farm
this
had
been
a
year
ago
when
jeremy
had
been
only
seven
nevertheless
he
had
been
present
during
the
first
part
of
the
ceremony
and
charlotte
had
struck
him
as
entirely
amazing
he
had
simply
gazed
at
her
with
his
mouth
open
forgetting
all
his
good
manners
she
was
at
this
time
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
but
very
small
and
as
they
say
of
the
most
modern
kind
of
doll
perfect
in
every
she
had
wonderful
hair
of
a
bright
rippling
gold
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
her
eyes
were
blue
and
she
was
so
beautifully
dressed
that
you
could
not
take
in
details
but
must
simply
surrender
yourself
to
a
cloudy
film
of
white
or
blue
with
everything
so
perfectly
in
its
place
that
it
seemed
to
the
rough
and
ready
jeremy
quite
unearthly
of
course
she
had
to
be
very
careful
how
she
walked
when
she
sat
down
in
what
way
she
moved
her
hands
and
feet
and
how
she
blew
her
nose
it
was
wonderful
to
see
her
do
these
things
she
did
them
so
naturally
and
yet
always
with
a
sense
of
an
effort
overcome
for
the
good
of
humanity
her
mother
never
ceased
to
empty
praises
at
her
feet
appealing
to
visitors
with
is
charlotte
too
lovely
or
really
cole
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
charlotte
hair
or
just
a
moment
cole
i
sure
you
never
seen
such
hands
and
feet
on
any
human
being
before
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
or
no
charlotte
was
moved
by
these
praises
because
she
never
said
anything
at
all
she
was
almost
completely
silent
and
once
at
the
in
cow
farm
when
she
suddenly
said
i
tired
mama
jeremy
nearly
jumped
from
his
chair
so
astonished
he
was
jeremy
had
during
the
year
that
intervened
between
that
visit
and
this
sometimes
thought
of
charlotte
and
he
had
looked
back
upon
her
not
as
a
little
girl
but
as
something
strange
fantastic
wonderfully
coloured
whom
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
again
he
wondered
why
mary
and
helen
could
not
be
like
that
instead
of
running
about
and
screaming
and
becoming
red
in
the
face
he
said
once
to
mary
that
she
should
imitate
charlotte
and
the
scene
that
followed
was
terrible
mary
from
that
moment
hated
charlotte
with
an
overpowering
hatred
here
this
year
they
were
again
mrs
le
page
with
her
long
neck
her
beautiful
pearl
her
pale
watery
eyes
and
her
tapering
fingers
charlotte
just
as
before
silent
beautiful
and
precious
there
was
again
a
at
cow
farm
and
on
this
occasion
jeremy
was
asked
to
show
hamlet
but
hamlet
behaved
badly
trying
to
jump
upon
charlotte
white
frock
and
soil
her
blue
ribbons
charlotte
screamed
exactly
as
a
doll
screams
when
you
press
it
in
the
stomach
and
hamlet
was
so
deeply
astonished
at
the
unexpected
noise
that
he
stopped
his
bad
behaviour
sat
on
his
hind
legs
and
gazed
up
at
her
with
an
anxious
wondering
expression
in
spite
of
this
unfortunate
incident
the
visit
went
off
well
and
cole
said
that
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
lovely
as
charlotte
and
mrs
le
page
said
no
had
anyone
ever
and
charlotte
never
turned
a
hair
the
final
arrangement
was
that
there
should
be
a
picnic
and
soon
because
mr
le
page
has
to
return
to
warwickshire
to
look
after
the
estate
so
tiresome
but
i
no
doubt
it
all
going
to
wrack
and
ruin
without
after
the
picnic
had
been
arranged
the
coles
were
frankly
a
little
uneasy
the
family
of
le
page
was
not
the
easiest
in
the
world
to
entertain
and
the
thought
of
a
whole
day
with
mr
le
page
who
was
a
very
black
very
silent
gentleman
and
looked
as
though
he
were
always
counting
sums
over
in
his
head
was
truly
alarming
moreover
in
the
ordinary
way
a
picnic
which
depended
so
entirely
for
its
success
on
the
weather
was
no
great
risk
because
the
coles
were
indifferent
to
rain
as
all
true
glebeshire
people
must
be
but
that
the
le
pages
should
be
wet
was
quite
another
affair
the
thought
of
a
dripping
mrs
le
page
was
intolerable
but
of
a
dripping
charlotte
quite
impossible
moreover
the
plain
but
excellent
food
pasties
saffron
cake
apples
and
ginger
beer
enjoyed
by
the
coles
seemed
quite
too
terrestrial
for
the
le
pages
mrs
le
page
and
ginger
beer
charlotte
and
pasties
nevertheless
the
invitation
had
been
given
and
accepted
the
coles
could
but
anxiously
inspect
the
sky
ii
there
was
another
reason
why
jeremy
looked
forward
to
the
picnic
with
impatience
a
funny
old
lady
named
miss
henhouse
who
lived
near
cow
farm
in
a
little
cottage
all
by
herself
called
sometimes
upon
the
coles
and
told
them
stories
about
the
people
and
the
place
which
made
them
sit
up
in
their
she
was
an
old
lady
with
sharp
eyes
a
black
moustache
and
a
double
chin
wore
an
old
shabby
bonnet
grey
mittens
and
large
shoes
which
banged
after
her
as
she
walked
she
leant
on
a
cane
with
a
silver
knob
to
it
and
she
wore
a
huge
cameo
brooch
on
her
breast
with
a
miniature
of
herself
inside
it
she
was
what
is
called
in
novels
a
there
was
no
one
who
knew
so
much
about
rafiel
and
its
neighbourhood
she
had
lived
here
for
ever
her
father
had
been
a
friend
of
wellington
and
had
known
members
of
the
local
press
gang
intimately
it
was
from
her
that
jeremy
heard
in
detail
the
famous
story
of
the
scarlet
admiral
it
was
of
course
in
any
case
a
story
and
jeremy
had
often
heard
it
before
but
miss
henhouse
made
it
a
new
a
most
vivid
and
realistic
thing
she
sat
forward
in
her
chair
leaning
on
her
cane
her
eyes
staring
in
front
of
her
her
two
chins
bobbing
gazing
gazing
as
though
it
all
had
happened
before
her
very
nose
how
one
night
outside
rafiel
cove
there
was
a
terrible
storm
and
on
the
morning
afterwards
a
wonderful
smiling
calm
and
how
the
village
idiot
out
for
his
early
morning
stroll
saw
a
splendid
ship
riding
beyond
the
cove
a
ship
of
gold
with
sails
of
silk
and
jewelled
masts
as
he
watched
from
the
ship
a
boat
pushed
out
and
then
landed
on
the
sand
of
the
cove
a
wonderful
company
in
cocked
hats
of
gold
lace
plush
breeches
of
red
and
shoes
with
diamond
buckles
the
leader
of
them
was
a
little
man
with
a
vast
cocked
hat
and
a
splendid
sword
all
studded
with
jewels
the
fool
peering
over
the
hedge
saw
him
give
orders
to
his
men
and
then
walk
alone
up
the
little
winding
path
to
the
straight
up
the
path
he
came
then
right
past
the
fool
himself
standing
at
last
upon
the
turnip
field
of
farmer
ede
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
farmers
of
those
parts
and
here
he
waited
staring
out
to
sea
his
arms
crossed
his
eyes
very
fierce
and
very
very
sad
then
a
second
time
from
the
golden
ship
a
boat
pushed
out
cutting
its
way
through
the
glassy
sea
and
there
landed
on
the
beach
a
young
man
very
beautiful
in
a
suit
of
blue
and
gold
and
he
without
a
glance
at
the
waiting
sailors
also
slowly
climbed
the
and
at
last
he
too
reached
farmer
ede
turnip
field
then
he
and
the
scarlet
admiral
bowed
to
one
another
very
beautifully
very
sadly
and
very
very
fiercely
as
the
sun
rose
high
in
the
sky
as
the
cows
passed
clumsily
down
the
lane
behind
the
field
so
the
fool
with
eyes
staring
and
heart
thumping
saw
these
two
fight
a
duel
to
the
death
there
could
be
no
question
from
the
first
how
it
would
end
the
beautiful
young
man
in
his
fine
blue
suit
and
his
white
cambric
shirt
had
despair
upon
his
face
he
knew
that
his
hour
had
come
and
the
eyes
of
the
scarlet
admiral
were
ever
sadder
and
ever
fiercer
then
with
a
sudden
move
a
little
turn
of
his
agile
body
the
scarlet
admiral
had
the
young
man
through
the
breast
the
young
man
threw
up
his
arms
and
cried
and
as
the
scarlet
admiral
withdrew
his
sword
dripping
with
blood
from
his
body
the
young
man
fell
backwards
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
then
the
scarlet
admiral
wiped
his
sword
on
the
grass
and
slowly
and
sadly
walked
down
the
even
as
he
had
walked
up
he
joined
his
men
they
found
their
boat
pushed
out
to
their
ship
and
even
as
they
landed
upon
her
she
had
disappeared
a
moment
later
the
fool
saw
the
parson
of
rafiel
church
coming
round
the
corner
for
his
morning
bathe
and
two
minutes
afterwards
nothing
human
was
to
be
seen
save
the
naked
limbs
of
the
parson
and
his
little
bundle
of
black
clothes
lying
neatly
upon
a
stone
then
the
fool
ran
all
the
way
home
to
his
mother
who
was
a
widow
and
sat
and
cried
and
cried
for
the
beautiful
young
man
who
had
been
slain
nor
would
he
eat
nor
taste
the
excellent
rafiel
beer
and
he
pined
away
and
at
last
he
died
first
telling
this
history
to
his
mother
who
like
all
widows
was
a
garulous
woman
and
loved
a
good
story
impossible
to
imagine
with
what
life
and
fire
old
miss
henhouse
gave
this
history
you
could
see
with
your
own
eyes
the
golden
ship
the
diamond
buckles
of
the
scarlet
admiral
the
young
man
sad
eyes
the
parson
black
clothes
when
she
had
finished
it
seemed
to
jeremy
that
it
must
have
been
just
so
she
told
him
that
now
on
a
summer
morning
or
evening
the
scarlet
admiral
might
still
be
seen
climbing
the
wiping
his
sword
upon
the
grass
gazing
out
with
sad
eyes
to
sea
jeremy
swore
to
himself
that
on
the
next
occasion
of
visiting
the
cove
he
would
watch
he
would
to
no
single
human
being
would
he
speak
anything
of
this
this
was
the
second
reason
why
he
had
looked
forward
so
eagerly
to
the
iii
the
day
arrived
and
it
was
marvellously
fine
one
of
those
days
in
august
when
heat
possesses
the
world
and
holds
it
tranced
and
still
but
has
in
the
very
strength
of
its
possession
some
scent
of
the
decay
and
chill
of
autumn
that
is
to
follow
so
close
upon
its
heels
there
was
no
breeze
no
wind
from
the
sea
only
a
sky
utterly
without
cloud
and
a
world
without
sound
punctually
at
eleven
of
the
morning
the
splendid
le
page
equipage
arrived
at
cow
farm
splendid
it
was
a
large
wagonette
with
a
stout
supercilious
fellow
on
the
box
who
sniffed
at
the
healthy
odours
of
the
farm
and
stared
haughtily
at
monk
as
though
she
should
be
ashamed
to
be
alive
the
coles
had
provided
a
small
plump
jingle
with
a
small
plump
pony
their
regular
conveyance
the
pony
was
bob
and
he
would
not
go
up
hills
unless
persuaded
with
sugar
but
jeremy
loved
him
and
would
not
have
ridden
behind
any
other
steed
in
the
whole
world
how
contemptuously
the
big
black
horses
of
the
wagonette
gazed
down
their
nostrils
at
bob
and
how
superbly
mrs
le
page
sitting
very
upright
under
her
white
sunshade
greeted
cole
dear
cole
such
a
hot
morning
is
it
lovely
of
course
but
so
i
afraid
jeremy
heard
his
mother
say
that
your
carriage
will
never
get
down
the
rafiel
lane
mrs
le
page
we
hoped
you
come
in
the
plenty
of
room
superb
to
witness
the
fashion
in
which
mrs
le
page
gazed
at
the
for
all
of
us
dear
cole
i
scarcely
think
and
frock
then
jeremy
turned
his
eyes
to
charlotte
she
sat
under
a
miniature
sunshade
of
white
silk
and
lace
a
vision
of
loveliness
she
was
a
shimmer
of
white
a
little
white
cloud
that
had
settled
for
a
moment
upon
the
seat
of
the
carriage
to
allow
the
sun
to
dance
upon
it
to
caress
it
with
fingers
of
fire
so
to
separate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
world
for
ever
as
something
too
precious
to
be
touched
jeremy
had
never
seen
anything
so
lovely
he
blushed
and
scraped
his
boots
the
one
against
the
other
and
this
is
jeremy
said
mrs
le
page
as
though
she
said
and
this
is
where
you
keep
your
little
pigs
monk
yes
said
jeremy
blushing
charlotte
you
know
jeremy
you
must
be
yes
said
charlotte
without
moving
then
jeremy
tumbled
into
the
stern
gaze
of
mr
le

who
arrayed
as
he
was
in
a
very
smart
suit
of
the
whitest
flannels
looked
with
his
black
beard
and
fierce
black
eyebrows
like
a
pirate
king
disguised
how
are
you
said
mr
le
page
in
a
deep
bass
voice
very
well
thank
you
said
jeremy
to
tell
the
truth
cole
heart
sadly
misgave
her
when
she
saw
the
le
page
family
all
sitting
up
so
new
and
so
bright
in
their
new
and
bright
carriage
she
thought
of
the
simple
preparations
that
had
been
made
the
pasties
the
saffron
buns
and
the
ginger
beer
she
looked
around
her
at
the
very
plain
but
useful
garments
worn
by
her
family
her
husband
in
faded
grey
flannel
trousers
and
a
cricketing
shirt
helen
and
mary
in
the
simplest
blue
cotton
and
jeremy
in
his
sailor
suit
she
had
intended
to
bring
their
bathing
things
in
a
bundle
but
now
she
put
them
aside
it
was
obvious
that
the
le
pages
had
no
intention
of
bathing
she
sighed
and
foresaw
a
difficult
day
ahead
of
her
it
was
evident
that
the
le
pages
did
not
intend
to
come
one
step
farther
into
cow
farm
than
was
necessary
dear
cole
on
a
hot
day
how
can
you
endure
the
smells
of
a
farm
such
a
charming
farm
too
with
all
its
cows
and
pigs
but
in
this
weather
charlotte
darling
you
do
feel
the
heat
no
hold
your
a
little
more
to
the
right
love
that
right
she
was
not
quite
the
thing
last
night
cole
i
had
some
doubts
about
bringing
her
but
i
knew
you
all
be
so
disappointed
she
looking
rather
lovely
do
you
think
you
must
forgive
a
partiality
oh
you
not
bringing
that
little
dog
are
you
surely
jeremy
who
had
from
the
first
hated
mrs
le
page
forgot
his
shyness
and
brought
out
fiercely
of
course
he
coming
hamlet
always
goes
everywhere
with
hamlet
said
mr
le
page
in
his
deep
bass
voice
what
a
strange
name
for
a
dog
said
mrs
le
page
in
tones
of
vague
distrust
at
last
it
was
settled
that
one
member
of
the
cole
party
should
ride
with
the
le
pages
and
mary
was
selected
poor
mary
inevitably
chosen
when
something
unpleasant
must
be
done
it
was
especially
hard
for
her
because
she
entertained
so
implacable
a
hatred
for
the
lovely
charlotte
and
looked
it
must
be
confessed
so
plain
and
shabby
by
the
side
of
her
indeed
to
any
observer
with
a
heart
it
must
have
been
touching
to
see
mary
driven
away
in
that
magnificent
black
carriage
staring
with
agonised
hostility
in
front
of
her
through
her
large
spectacles
compelled
to
balance
herself
exactly
between
the
magnificent
sunshade
of
mrs
le
page
and
the
smaller
but
also
magnificent
sunshade
of
the
lovely
charlotte
cole
glancing
in
that
direction
may
have
felt
with
a
pang
that
she
would
never
be
able
to
make
her
children
handsome
and
gay
as
she
would
like
to
do
but
it
was
certainly
a
pang
of
only
a
moment
duration
she
would
not
have
exchanged
her
mary
for
a
of
charlottes
and
jeremy
bumping
along
in
the
jingle
also
felt
the
contrast
why
could
not
mary
wear
her
straw
hat
straight
and
why
must
she
have
elastic
under
her
chin
why
did
she
look
so
cross
and
so
stupid
why
did
she
bother
him
so
with
her
worries
charlotte
would
never
worry
him
she
would
just
sit
there
looking
beautiful
with
her
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
next
week
was
to
be
miss
jones
birthday
and
in
preparation
for
this
he
had
bought
for
her
in
polchester
a
silver
thimble
he
wondered
whether
he
would
not
give
charlotte
this
thimble
instead
of
miss
jones
he
could
give
miss
jones
some
old
thing
he
would
find
somewhere
or
he
would
go
out
and
pick
for
her
some
flowers
she
would
be
pleased
with
anything
he
wondered
what
charlotte
would
say
when
he
gave
her
the
thimble
she
would
like
it
of
course
she
would
smile
she
would
open
her
eyes
and
look
at
him
fortunately
he
had
the
thimble
even
now
in
his
pocket
he
had
bought
it
when
he
was
wearing
this
same
suit
yes
he
would
give
it
to
her
as
he
decided
this
he
looked
at
miss
jones
guiltily
but
she
was
making
such
odd
faces
as
she
squinted
to
escape
from
the
sun
that
he
did
not
feel
ashamed
they
came
to
that
steep
hill
just
beyond
garth
woods
and
bob
of
course
refused
to
move
the
superb
le
page
affair
dashed
past
them
shouted
something
at
them
and
disappeared
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
last
thing
to
be
seen
of
them
were
the
fierce
despairing
eyes
of
the
imprisoned
mary
a
strange
sensation
of
relief
instantly
settled
upon
the
coles
for
a
moment
they
were
alone
they
began
slowly
to
walk
up
the
hill
dragging
with
them
the
reluctant
bob
about
them
was
peace
absolute
and
unstained
the
hard
glitter
of
the
day
shone
upon
the
white
road
but
behind
them
the
wood
was
dark
and
cool
a
green
cloud
against
the
sky
behind
the
steep
hedges
the
harvesters
were
moving
in
the
air
a
lark
was
singing
and
along
the
ditch
at
the
road
side
a
tiny
stream
tumbled
and
beyond
these
sounds
there
was
a
vast
tranquil
silence
the
coles
moved
up
the
hill
very
slowly
only
hamlet
racing
ahead
to
find
spots
of
shadow
where
he
might
lie
down
and
pant
they
would
not
confess
to
themselves
that
this
promised
to
be
the
happiest
moment
of
their
day
they
went
bravely
forward
on
the
bend
of
the
hill
the
le
pages
were
waiting
for
them
what
cole
had
foreseen
had
in
truth
occurred
the
le
page
carriage
would
not
go
down
the
rafiel
lane
no
it
would
not
nothing
would
induce
it
to
james
said
mrs
le
page
to
her
stout
and
disdainful
attendant
nothing
said
james
dear
me
dear
me
said
mrs
le
page
well
then
we
must
walk
said
the
deep
despairing
voice
of
the
pirate
king
and
walk
they
did
that
walk
was
as
cole
afterwards
said
a
pity
because
it
destroyed
the
le
page
tempers
when
the
day
was
scarcely
begun
mr
le
page
was
it
was
quickly
descried
not
intended
for
walking
strong
and
fierce
though
he
seemed
heat
instantly
crumpled
him
up
the
perfect
crease
of
his
white
trousers
vanished
his
collar
was
no
longer
spotless
little
beads
of
perspiration
appeared
almost
at
once
on
his
forehead
and
his
black
beard
dripped
moisture
mrs
le
page
with
her
skirts
raised
walked
as
though
she
were
passing
through
the
valley
of
destruction
every
step
was
a
risk
and
a
danger
and
the
difficulty
of
holding
her
skirts
and
her
sunshade
at
the
same
time
and
of
seeing
that
her
shoes
were
not
soiled
and
her
hat
not
caught
by
an
offending
bough
gave
her
face
an
expression
of
desperate
despair
there
was
unfortunately
one
spot
very
deep
down
in
the
lane
where
the
ground
was
never
dry
even
in
the
height
of
the
hottest
summer
a
little
stream
ran
here
across
the
path
and
the
ground
on
either
side
was
soft
and
sodden
mrs
le
page
struggling
to
avoid
an
overhanging
branch
stepped
into
the
mud
one
foot
stuck
there
and
it
needed
cole
strong
arm
to
pull
her
out
of
it
charlotte
charlotte
she
cried
do
let
charlotte
step
into
that
cole
cole
i
charge
you
my
child
charlotte
was
conveyed
across
but
the
damage
was
done
one
of
mrs
le
page
beautiful
shoes
was
thick
with
mud
when
therefore
the
party
climbing
out
of
the
lane
came
suddenly
upon
the
path
leading
down
to
the
cove
with
the
sea
like
a
blue
cloud
in
front
of
them
no
one
exclaimed
at
the
view
it
was
a
very
beautiful
view
one
of
the
finest
of
its
kind
in
the
united
kingdom
the
high
rocks
closing
in
the
cove
and
the
green
hills
closing
in
the
rocks
on
the
hill
to
the
right
was
the
rafiel
old
church
with
its
graveyard
that
ran
to
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
and
behind
the
cove
was
a
stream
and
a
green
orchard
and
a
little
wood
the
sand
of
the
cove
was
bright
gold
and
the
low
rocks
to
either
side
of
it
were
a
dark
red
the
handsomest
place
in
the
world
with
the
water
so
clear
that
you
could
see
down
far
down
into
green
caverns
laced
with
silver
sand
unfortunately
at
the
moment
when
the
coles
and
their
friends
beheld
it
it
was
blazing
in
the
sun
soon
the
sun
would
pass
and
during
the
whole
afternoon
half
of
it
at
least
would
lie
in
shadow
but
the
le
pages
could
not
be
expected
to
think
of
that
the
basket
was
unloaded
from
the
jingle
and
carried
down
to
the
beach
by
cole
and
jim
jeremy
finding
himself
at
the
side
of
the
lovely
charlotte
was
convulsed
with
shyness
the
more
that
he
knew
that
the
unhappy
mary
was
listening
with
jealous
ears
charlotte
walking
like
agag
delicately
had
a
piteous
expression
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
were
being
led
to
the
torture
jeremy
coughed
and
began
we
always
come
here
every
year
do
you
like
it
yes
she
said
miserably
and
we
paddle
and
bathe
do
you
like
bathing
going
into
the
sea
oh
no
mother
says
i
must
because
it
hurt
my
hair
do
you
like
my
hair
yes
said
jeremy
blushing
at
so
direct
an
invitation
to
compliment
mother
says
i
got
to
be
very
careful
of
my
hair
because
it
my
chief
yes
said
jeremy
i
have
a
maid
alice
and
she
brushes
a
whole
hour
every
morning
and
a
whole
hour
every
do
you
get
very
tired
asked
jeremy
i
know
i
mother
says
if
you
have
such
beautiful
hair
you
must
take
trouble
with
it
charlotte
gravely
replied
her
voice
was
so
like
the
voice
of
a
parrot
that
jeremy
grandmother
had
once
possessed
that
it
did
seem
as
though
a
human
being
was
speaking
at
all
they
were
near
the
beach
now
and
could
see
the
blue
slipping
in
turning
into
white
bubbles
then
slipping
out
again
do
you
like
my
frock
said
charlotte
yes
said
jeremy
it
was
bought
in
london
all
my
clothes
are
bought
in
mary
and
helen
are
said
jeremy
with
some
faint
idea
of
protecting
his
sisters
they
bought
in
mother
says
said
charlotte
that
if
you
not
pretty
it
matter
where
you
buy
your
they
arrived
on
the
beach
and
stared
about
them
it
became
at
once
a
great
question
as
to
where
mrs
le
page
would
sit
she
could
not
sit
on
the
sand
which
looked
damp
nor
equally
of
course
on
a
rock
that
was
spiky
and
hard
what
to
do
with
her
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
still
holding
up
her
skirts
gazing
desperately
about
her
looking
first
at
one
spot
and
then
at
another
oh
dear
the
heat
she
exclaimed
is
there
no
shade
anywhere
perhaps
in
that
over
there
it
was
probable
enough
that
no
member
of
the
cole
family
would
have
minded
banishing
mrs
le
page
into
the
farmhouse
but
it
would
have
meant
that
the
whole
party
must
accompany
her
that
was
impossible
they
had
come
for
a
picnic
and
a
picnic
they
would
have
cole
watched
with
growing
agitation
the
whole
situation
she
saw
from
her
husband
face
that
he
was
rapidly
losing
his
temper
and
she
had
learnt
after
many
experiences
that
when
he
lost
his
temper
he
was
capable
of
anything
that
does
not
mean
of
course
that
he
ever
was
angry
to
the
extent
of
swearing
or
striking
out
with
his
fists
no
he
simply
grew
sadder
and
sadder
and
sadder
and
this
melancholy
had
a
way
of
reducing
to
despair
all
the
people
with
whom
he
happened
to
be
at
the
time
what
does
everyone
say
to
our
having
lunch
now
cried
cole
cheerfully
it
after
one
and
i
sure
everyone
no
one
said
anything
so
preparations
were
begun
a
minute
piece
of
shade
was
found
for
mrs
le
page
and
here
she
sat
on
a
flat
piece
of
rock
with
her
skirts
drawn
close
about
her
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
rats
or
crabs
a
tablecloth
was
laid
on
the
sand
and
the
provisions
spread
out
pasties
for
everybody
and
and
ginger
beer
it
looked
a
fine
feast
when
it
was
all
there
and
cole
as
she
gave
the
final
touch
to
it
by
placing
a
drinking
glass
containing
two
red
in
the
middle
felt
proud
of
her
efforts
and
hoped
that
after
all
the
affair
might
pass
off
bravely
but
alas
how
easily
the
proudest
plans
fall
to
the
ground
i
hope
alice
you
have
forgotten
the
salt
instantly
cole
knew
that
she
had
forgotten
it
she
could
see
herself
standing
there
in
monk
kitchen
forgetting
it
how
could
she
and
monk
how
could
she
it
had
never
been
forgotten
before
oh
no
she
said
wildly
oh
no
i
sure
i
ca
have
forgotten
she
plunged
about
her
red
face
all
creased
with
anxiety
her
hat
on
one
side
her
hands
searching
everywhere
under
the
tablecloth
in
the
basket
amongst
the
knives
and
forks
jim
you
have
dropped
anything
no
mum
beggin
your
pardon
mum
the
basket
was
closed
so
to
speak
closed
it
no
she
knew
that
she
had
forgotten
it
i
so
sorry
mrs
le
page
i
afraid
my
dear
cole
what
does
it
matter
not
in
the
least
i
assure
you
in
this
heat
it
impossible
to
feel
hungry
is
it
i
assure
you
i
do
feel
as
though
i
could
touch
a
thing
a
little
fruit
perhaps
an
apple
or
a
peach
fruit
why
had
cole
brought
fruit
she
might
so
easily
have
done
so
and
she
had
never
thought
about
it
they
themselves
were
rather
tired
of
fruit
and
so
i
afraid
we
no
fruit
but
an
eggs
need
salt
do
you
think
not
that
it
matters
in
the
very
least
but
so
that
you
should
think
me
fussy
really
dear
cole
i
never
felt
less
hungry
in
my
life
just
a
drop
of
milk
and
i
perfectly
jeremy
shall
run
up
to
the
farm
for
the
milk
you
do
mind
jeremy
dear
do
you
it
only
a
step
just
take
this
sixpence
dear
and
say
we
send
the
jug
back
this
afternoon
if
they
spare
jeremy
did
mind
he
was
enjoying
his
luncheon
and
he
was
gazing
at
charlotte
and
he
was
teasing
hamlet
with
scraps
he
was
very
happy
nevertheless
he
started
off
so
soon
as
he
left
the
sands
the
noise
of
the
sea
was
shut
off
from
him
and
he
was
climbing
the
little
green
path
up
which
the
scarlet
admiral
had
once
stalked
suddenly
he
remembered
in
his
excitement
about
charlotte
he
had
forgotten
the
admiral
he
stood
for
a
moment
listening
the
green
hedge
shut
off
the
noise
of
the
sea
only
above
his
head
some
birds
were
twittering
he
fancied
that
he
heard
footsteps
then
that
beyond
the
hedge
something
was
moving
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
birds
were
also
listening
for
something
well
it
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
thought
to
himself
he
never
comes
there
only
in
the
morning
or
evening
but
he
hurried
forward
after
that
wishing
that
he
had
called
to
hamlet
to
accompany
him
it
was
a
pleasant
climb
to
the
farm
through
the
green
orchard
and
he
found
at
the
farm
door
an
agreeable
woman
who
smiled
at
him
when
she
gave
him
the
milk
he
had
to
come
down
the
hill
carefully
lest
the
milk
should
be
spilt
he
walked
along
very
happily
humming
to
himself
and
thinking
in
a
confused
summer
afternoon
kind
of
manner
of
charlotte
hamlet
mrs
le
page
and
himself
shall
i
give
her
the
thimble
or
sha
i
i
could
take
her
to
the
pools
where
the
little
crabs
are
she
like
them
i
wonder
whether
going
to
bathe
mrs
le
page
will
look
funny
bathing
then
he
was
in
the
green
lane
again
and
at
once
his
discomfort
returned
to
him
and
he
looked
around
his
shoulder
and
into
the
hedges
and
stopped
once
and
again
to
listen
there
was
no
sound
the
birds
it
seemed
had
all
fallen
to
sleep
the
hedges
he
thought
were
closer
about
him
it
was
very
hot
here
with
no
breeze
and
no
comforting
sound
of
the
sea
i
wonder
whether
he
really
does
come
he
thought
it
must
be
horrid
to
see
him
coming
quite
and
the
thought
of
the
fool
also
frightened
him
the
fool
with
his
tongue
out
and
his
shaking
legs
like
the
idiot
who
lived
near
the
cathedral
at
home
at
the
thought
of
this
jeremy
suddenly
took
to
his
legs
and
ran
covering
the
top
of
his
jug
with
his
hand
then
when
he
came
out
on
to
the
strip
of
grass
that
crossed
the
top
of
the
beach
he
stopped
suddenly
ashamed
of
himself
scarlet
admirals
scarlet
admirals
how
could
there
be
scarlet
admirals
in
a
world
that
also
contained
so
blazing
a
sun
so
blue
a
sea
and
the
gorgeous
realities
of
the
le
page
family
he
arrived
at
the
luncheon
party
hot
and
proud
and
smiling
so
cheerful
and
stolid
and
agreeable
that
even
mrs
le
page
was
compelled
to
say
really
cole
a
very
nice
little
boy
of
yours
come
here
little
jeremy
and
talk
to
me
how
deeply
he
hated
being
called
little
jeremy
only
mary
and
helen
knew
their
eyes
flew
to
his
face
to
see
how
he
would
take
it
he
took
it
very
well
he
sat
down
beside
mrs
le
page
who
very
gracefully
and
languidly
sipped
at
her
glass
of
milk
how
old
are
you
jeremy
dear
she
asked
him
eight
he
answered
wriggling
what
a
nice
age
and
one
day
you
go
to
school
in
and
what
will
you
be
when
you
a
man
oh
i
do
know
i
be
a
soldier
oh
i
sure
you
would
like
to
be
a
soldier
and
kill
yes
i
would
there
lots
of
people
i
like
to
mrs
le
page
drew
her
skirts
back
a
little
how
horrible
i
sure
your
mother
would
like
to
hear
but
cole
had
caught
the
last
words
of
the
dialogue
and
interrupted
with
but
what
could
be
finer
mrs
le
page
than
the
defence
of
country
would
you
have
our
young
lads
grow
up
and
fail
their
motherland
when
she
calls
what
can
be
finer
i
say
than
to
die
for
queen
and
country
would
not
every
mother
have
her
son
shed
his
blood
for
liberty
and
freedom
no
jeremy
not
another
you
had
quite
enough
it
would
indeed
be
a
disheartening
sight
if
we
elders
were
to
watch
our
sons
and
grandchildren
turning
their
swords
into
ploughshares
he
was
interrupted
by
a
shrill
cry
from
mrs
le
page
charlotte
darling
do
hold
your
sunshade
up
all
the
left
side
of
your
face
is
exposed
that
better
dear
i
beg
your
pardon
but
cole
was
offended
i
hope
no
son
of
mine
will
ever
show
himself
a
faint
heart
he
concluded
severely
the
luncheon
in
fact
had
been
a
most
dismal
failure
the
coles
could
fling
their
minds
back
to
luncheons
on
this
same
beach
that
had
been
simply
riotous
successes
what
fun
they
had
had
what
games
what
bathes
now
the
very
sight
of
mr
le
page
black
beard
was
enough
even
jeremy
felt
that
things
were
wrong
then
he
looked
at
charlotte
and
was
satisfied
there
she
sat
straight
and
stiff
her
hands
on
her
lap
her
hair
falling
in
lovely
golden
ripples
down
her
back
her
gaze
fixed
on
distance
oh
she
was
beautiful
he
would
do
whatever
she
told
him
he
would
give
her
miss
noah
and
the
apple
tree
he
would
a
sound
disturbed
his
devotions
he
turned
both
and
mrs
le
page
were
fast
asleep
iv
children
whispered
cole
very
quietly
now
so
that
you
disturb
anyone
run
off
to
the
farther
beach
and
play
helen
you
see
that
everything
is
all
right
wo
you
it
was
only
just
in
time
that
jeremy
succeeded
in
strangling
bark
into
a
snort
and
even
then
they
all
looked
round
for
a
moment
at
the
sleepers
in
the
greatest
anxiety
but
no
they
had
not
been
disturbed
if
only
mr
le
page
could
have
known
what
he
resembled
lying
there
with
his
mouth
open
but
he
did
not
know
he
was
doubtless
dreaming
of
his
property
the
children
crept
away
charlotte
and
jeremy
together
jeremy
heart
beat
thickly
at
last
he
had
the
lovely
creature
in
his
charge
it
was
true
that
he
did
not
quite
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
her
and
that
even
now
in
the
height
of
his
admiration
he
did
wish
that
she
would
not
walk
as
though
she
were
treading
on
ploughshares
and
that
she
could
talk
a
little
instead
of
giving
little
shivers
of
apprehension
at
every
step
i
must
say
he
thought
to
himself
she
rather
silly
in
some
ways
perhaps
it
would
be
fun
to
see
her
they
turned
the
corner
round
a
projecting
finger
of
rock
and
a
new
little
beach
white
and
gleaming
lay
in
front
of
them
well
said
jeremy
here
we
are
what
shall
we
play
there
was
dead
silence
we
might
play
pirates
he
continued
i
be
the
pirate
and
mary
can
sit
on
that
rock
until
the
water
comes
round
her
and
charlotte
shall
hide
in
that
cave
there
was
still
silence
looking
about
him
he
discovered
from
his
sisters
countenances
that
they
were
resolved
to
lend
no
kind
of
assistance
and
he
then
from
that
deduced
the
simple
fact
that
his
sisters
hated
charlotte
and
were
not
going
to
make
it
pleasant
for
her
in
any
way
if
they
could
help
it
oh
it
was
a
miserable
picnic
the
worst
that
he
ever
had
it
too
hot
to
play
said
helen
loftily
i
going
to
sit
down
over
so
am
i
said
mary
they
moved
away
their
heads
in
the
air
and
their
legs
ridiculously
stiff
jeremy
gazed
at
charlotte
in
distress
it
was
very
wicked
of
his
sisters
to
go
off
like
that
but
it
was
also
very
silly
of
charlotte
to
stand
there
so
helplessly
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
perhaps
he
would
give
the
thimble
to
miss
jones
after
all
would
you
like
to
go
and
see
the
pool
where
the
little
crabs
are
he
asked
i
do
know
she
answered
her
upper
lip
trembling
as
though
she
were
going
to
cry
i
want
to
go
home
with
you
ca
go
home
he
said
firmly
and
you
ca
see
your
mother
because
she
i
made
my
shoes
dirty
she
said
looking
down
at
her
feet
and
so
tired
of
holding
my
i
should
shut
it
up
jeremy
said
without
any
hesitation
i
think
a
silly
thing
i
glad
i
not
a
girl
do
you
have
to
take
it
with
you
everywhere
not
if
it
raining
then
i
have
an
i
think
you
better
come
and
see
the
crabs
he
settled
they
only
just
over
she
moved
along
with
him
reluctantly
looking
back
continually
to
where
her
mother
ought
to
be
are
you
enjoying
yourself
jeremy
asked
politely
no
she
said
without
any
hesitation
i
want
to
go
she
as
selfish
as
anything
he
thought
to
himself
we
giving
the
party
and
she
ought
to
have
said
even
if
she
do
you
like
my
dog
he
asked
with
another
effort
at
light
conversation
no
she
answered
with
a
little
shiver
he
he
is
ugly
jeremy
returned
indignantly
he
is
perhaps
the
very
best
breed
but
uncle
samuel
says
that
that
does
matter
if
clever
he
better
than
any
other
dog
i
love
him
more
than
anybody
he
is
ugly
he
is
cried
charlotte
with
a
kind
of
wail
oh
i
want
to
go
well
you
ca
go
home
he
answered
her
fiercely
so
you
think
about
they
came
to
the
little
pools
three
of
them
now
clear
as
crystal
blue
on
their
surface
with
green
depths
and
red
shelving
rock
now
you
sit
there
he
said
cheerfully
no
one
will
touch
you
the
crabs
wo
get
at
he
looked
about
him
and
noticed
with
surprise
where
he
was
he
was
sitting
on
the
farther
corner
of
the
very
beach
where
the
scarlet
admiral
had
landed
with
his
men
it
was
out
there
beyond
that
bend
of
rock
that
the
wonderful
ship
had
rode
with
its
gold
and
silk
its
jewelled
masts
and
its
glittering
board
directly
opposite
to
him
was
the
little
green
path
that
led
up
the
hill
and
above
it
the
very
field
farmer
ede
field
for
a
long
long
time
they
sat
there
in
silence
he
forgot
charlotte
in
his
interest
over
his
discovery
staring
about
him
and
watching
how
quickly
the
august
afternoon
was
losing
its
heat
and
colour
so
that
already
a
little
cold
autumnal
wind
was
playing
about
the
sand
the
colours
were
being
drawn
from
the
sky
and
a
grey
web
was
slowly
pulled
across
the
sea
now
he
said
cheerfully
at
last
to
charlotte
i
look
for
the
i
hate
crabs
she
said
i
want
to
go
you
ca
go
home
he
answered
furiously
what
the
good
of
saying
that
over
and
over
again
you
are
going
yet
so
it
no
use
saying
you
you
a
horrid
little
boy
she
brought
out
with
a
kind
of
inanimate
sob
he
did
not
reply
to
that
he
was
still
trying
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
how
could
he
ever
have
liked
her
why
her
hair
was
not
so
much
after
all
what
was
hair
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
mary
got
on
quite
well
with
hers
ugly
though
it
was
she
was
stupid
stupid
stupid
she
was
like
someone
dead
as
he
searched
for
the
crabs
that
were
there
he
felt
his
temper
growing
soon
he
would
lead
her
back
to
her
mother
and
leave
her
there
and
never
see
her
again
but
this
was
not
the
climax
of
the
afternoon
when
he
looked
up
from
gazing
into
the
pool
the
whole
world
seemed
to
have
changed
he
was
still
dazzled
perhaps
by
the
reflection
of
the
water
in
his
eyes
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
that
it
was
not
altogether
because
the
day
was
slipping
from
afternoon
into
evening
the
lazy
ripple
of
the
water
as
it
slutched
up
the
sand
and
then
broke
the
shadows
that
were
creeping
farther
and
farther
from
rock
to
rock
the
green
light
that
pushed
up
from
the
horizon
into
the
faint
blue
the
grey
web
of
the
sea
the
thick
gathering
of
the
hills
as
they
crept
more
closely
about
the
little
darkening
beach
it
was
none
of
these
things
he
began
hurriedly
to
tell
charlotte
about
the
scarlet
admiral
even
as
he
told
her
he
was
himself
caught
into
the
excitement
of
the
narration
he
forgot
her
he
did
not
see
her
white
cheeks
her
mouth
open
with
terror
an
expression
new
to
her
that
her
face
had
never
known
before
stealing
into
her
eyes
he
told
her
how
the
fool
had
seen
the
ship
how
the
admiral
had
landed
then
left
his
men
on
the
beach
how
he
had
climbed
the
little
green
path
how
the
young
man
had
followed
him
how
they
had
fought
how
the
young
man
had
fallen
what
was
that
jeremy
jumped
from
his
rock
i
say
did
you
hear
anything
and
that
was
enough
for
charlotte
with
one
scream
a
scream
such
as
she
had
never
uttered
in
her
life
before
sue
turned
and
then
running
as
indeed
she
had
never
run
before
she
stumbled
half
fell
stumbled
finally
ran
as
though
the
whole
world
of
her
ghosts
was
behind
her
her
screams
were
so
piercing
that
they
may
well
have
startled
the
villagers
of
rafiel
jeremy
followed
her
but
his
mind
was
not
with
her
was
he
going
to
see
something
what
was
it
who
was
it
then
the
awful
catastrophe
that
finished
the
afternoon
occurred
turning
the
corner
of
the
rock
charlotte
missed
her
footing
and
fell
straight
into
a
pool
jeremy
mary
and
helen
were
upon
her
almost
as
she
fell
they
dragged
her
out
but
alas
what
a
sight
was
there
instead
of
the
beautiful
and
magnificent
charlotte
there
was
a
bedraggled
and
dirty
little
girl
but
also
instead
of
an
inanimate
and
lifeless
doll
there
was
at
last
a
human
being
a
terrified
soul
the
scene
that
followed
passes
all
power
of
description
mrs
le
page
wailed
like
a
lost
spirit
mr
le
page
was
so
rude
to
cole
that
it
might
confidently
be
said
that
those
two
gentlemen
would
never
speak
to
one
another
again
cole
dismayed
though
she
was
had
some
fatalistic
consolation
that
she
had
known
from
the
first
that
the
picnic
would
be
a
most
dreadful
failure
and
that
the
worst
had
occurred
there
was
no
more
to
come
everyone
was
too
deeply
occupied
to
scold
jeremy
they
all
moved
up
to
the
farm
charlotte
behaving
most
strangely
even
striking
her
mother
and
crying
let
me
go
let
me
go
i
do
want
to
be
clean
frightened
i
frightened
jeremy
hung
behind
the
others
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
lane
he
stood
and
waited
was
there
a
figure
coming
up
through
the
dusk
did
someone
pass
him
why
did
he
suddenly
feel
no
longer
afraid
but
only
reassured
and
with
the
strangest
certainty
that
the
lane
the
beach
the
field
belonged
to
him
now
he
would
come
there
and
live
when
he
grew
up
he
would
come
often
had
the
scarlet
admiral
passed
him
if
not
the
scarlet
admiral
then
the
other
the
sea
picnic
had
after
all
been
not
quite
a
misfortune
jeremy
had
been
made
free
of
the
land
and
charlotte
charlotte
had
been
woken
up
and
never
would
go
to
sleep
again
chapter
mary
i
mary
cole
had
been
all
her
life
that
thing
beloved
of
the
sentimental
novelist
a
misunderstood
child
she
was
the
only
misunderstood
member
of
the
cole
family
and
she
was
misunderstood
as
is
very
often
the
case
in
a
large
measure
because
she
was
so
plain
had
she
been
as
helen
or
independent
as
jeremy
she
would
have
either
attracted
the
world
in
general
or
have
been
indifferent
as
to
whether
she
attracted
it
or
not
as
it
was
she
longed
to
attract
everyone
and
in
truth
attracted
nobody
she
might
have
found
consolation
in
books
or
her
own
imaginations
had
it
not
been
for
the
burning
passions
which
she
formed
at
a
very
early
age
for
living
people
for
some
years
now
her
life
had
centred
round
her
brother
jeremy
had
the
coles
been
an
observant
family
they
might
perhaps
have
found
some
pathos
in
the
way
in
which
mary
with
her
pale
sallow
complexion
her
face
with
its
dull
grey
eyes
her
enormous
glasses
her
lanky
colourless
hair
and
her
thin
bony
figure
gazed
at
her
masculine
and
independent
brother
uncle
samuel
might
have
noticed
but
he
was
occupied
with
his
painting
for
the
rest
they
were
not
observant
mary
was
only
seven
years
of
age
but
she
had
the
capacity
for
being
hurt
of
a
person
of
thirty
she
was
hurt
by
everything
and
everybody
when
somebody
said
now
mary
hurry
up
you
always
so
slow
she
was
hurt
if
helen
told
her
that
she
was
selfish
she
was
hurt
and
would
sit
wondering
whether
she
was
selfish
or
no
if
cole
said
that
she
must
brush
her
hair
more
carefully
she
was
hurt
and
when
jeremy
said
anything
sharp
to
her
she
was
in
agony
she
discovered
very
quickly
that
no
one
cared
for
her
agonies
the
coles
were
a
plain
race
and
had
the
day
work
to
finish
they
had
no
intention
of
thinking
too
much
of
their
children
feelings
thirty
years
ago
that
was
not
so
popular
as
it
is
now
meanwhile
her
devotion
to
her
brother
grew
with
every
month
of
her
life
she
thought
him
in
all
honesty
the
most
miraculous
of
all
human
beings
there
was
more
in
her
worship
than
mere
fidelity
she
adored
him
for
reasons
that
were
real
and
true
for
his
independence
his
obstinacy
his
sense
of
fun
his
sudden
unexpected
kindnesses
his
sudden
helplessness
and
above
all
for
his
bravery
he
seemed
to
her
the
bravest
hero
in
all
history
and
she
felt
it
the
more
because
she
was
herself
compact
of
every
fear
and
terror
known
to
man
it
was
not
enough
for
her
the
ordinary
panic
that
belongs
to
all
human
life
at
every
stage
of
its
progress
she
feared
everything
and
everybody
and
only
hid
her
fear
by
a
persistent
cover
of
almost
obstinate
stupidity
which
deceived
to
some
extent
her
relations
but
never
in
any
degree
herself
she
knew
that
she
was
plain
awkward
and
hesitating
but
she
knew
also
that
she
was
clever
she
knew
that
she
could
do
everything
twice
as
fast
as
jeremy
and
helen
that
she
was
often
so
impatient
of
their
slow
progress
at
lessons
that
she
would
beat
her
foot
on
the
ground
in
a
kind
of
agonised
impatience
she
knew
that
she
was
clever
and
she
wondered
sometimes
why
her
cleverness
did
not
give
her
more
advantage
why
for
instance
should
helen
good
looks
be
noticed
at
once
by
every
visitor
and
her
own
cleverness
be
unnoticed
certainly
on
occasions
her
mother
would
say
and
mary
i
do
think
you
met
mary
come
and
say
how
do
you
do
mary
mary
is
the
clever
one
of
the
family
but
it
was
always
said
in
a
deprecating
apologetic
tone
which
made
mary
hang
her
head
and
hate
both
herself
and
her
mother
she
told
herself
stories
of
the
times
when
jeremy
would
have
to
depend
entirely
upon
the
splendour
of
her
brains
for
his
delivery
from
some
horror
death
torture
or
disgrace
at
present
those
times
were
she
was
bound
to
confess
to
herself
very
distant
he
depended
upon
no
one
for
anything
he
could
not
be
said
to
need
mary
assistance
in
any
particular
and
with
this
burning
desire
of
hers
came
of
course
jealousy
there
are
some
happy
easy
natures
to
whom
jealousy
is
through
life
unknown
they
are
to
be
envied
jealousy
in
a
human
being
is
bad
in
a
child
it
is
terrible
had
you
told
cole
good
mother
though
she
was
that
her
daughter
mary
aged
seven
suffered
tortures
through
jealousy
she
would
have
assured
you
that
it
was
not
in
reality
jealousy
but
rather
indigestion
and
that
a
little
medicine
would
put
it
right
mary
was
quite
helpless
what
is
a
child
to
do
if
she
is
jealous
other
children
do
not
understand
her
her
elders
laugh
at
her
mary
with
a
wisdom
greatly
beyond
her
years
realised
very
quickly
that
this
was
some
sort
of
horrible
disease
with
which
she
must
wrestle
alone
above
all
she
must
never
allow
jeremy
to
know
anything
about
it
he
was
of
course
sublimely
unaware
of
the
matter
he
knew
that
mary
was
silly
sometimes
but
he
attributed
that
to
her
sex
he
went
on
his
way
happily
indifferent
whether
anyone
cared
for
him
or
no
mary
suffered
agonies
when
as
sometimes
happened
jeremy
sat
with
his
arm
round
helen
neck
and
his
cheek
up
against
hers
she
suffered
when
in
a
mood
of
tempestuous
affection
to
the
whole
world
he
kissed
miss
jones
she
even
suffered
when
he
sat
at
his
mother
feet
whilst
she
read
the
dove
in
the
eagle
nest
or
engel
the
most
of
all
however
she
suffered
over
hamlet
she
knew
that
at
this
present
time
hamlet
was
the
one
creature
for
whom
jeremy
passionately
cared
he
loved
his
mother
but
with
the
love
that
custom
and
habit
has
tamed
and
modified
although
since
cole
illness
in
the
early
summer
he
had
cared
for
her
in
a
manner
more
demonstrative
and
openly
affectionate
nevertheless
it
was
hamlet
who
commanded
jeremy
heart
and
mary
knew
it
matters
were
made
worse
by
the
undoubted
truth
that
hamlet
did
not
care
very
much
for
mary
that
is
he
never
gave
any
signs
of
caring
and
very
often
walked
out
of
the
room
when
she
came
into
it
mary
could
have
cared
for
the
dog
as
enthusiastically
as
jeremy
she
was
always
sentimental
about
animals
but
now
she
was
shut
out
from
their
alliance
and
she
knew
that
when
she
came
up
to
them
and
began
to
pat
or
stroke
hamlet
jeremy
was
annoyed
and
hamlet
skin
wriggled
in
a
kind
of
retreating
fashion
under
her
fingers
wise
people
will
say
that
it
is
impossible
for
this
to
be
a
serious
trouble
to
a
child
it
was
increasingly
serious
to
mary
jeremy
was
not
perhaps
so
tactful
as
he
might
have
been
oh
bother
mary
he
would
say
you
gone
and
waked
hamlet
up
or
do
stroke
hamlet
that
way
mary
he
hates
it
or
no
i
going
for
a
walk
with
hamlet
we
do
want
anyone
or
hamlet
himself
would
suddenly
bark
at
her
as
though
he
hated
her
or
would
bare
his
teeth
and
grin
at
her
in
a
mocking
sarcastic
way
that
he
had
at
first
as
an
answer
to
this
she
had
the
ridiculous
idea
of
herself
adopting
an
animal
and
she
selected
for
this
purpose
the
kitchen
cat
a
dull
somnolent
beast
whose
sleek
black
hair
was
furtive
and
green
crooked
eyes
malignant
the
cat
showed
no
signs
of
affection
for
mary
nor
could
she
herself
honestly
care
for
it
when
she
brought
it
with
her
into
the
schoolroom
hamlet
treated
it
in
a
scornful
sarcastic
fashion
that
was
worse
than
outrageous
attack
the
cat
was
uncleanly
and
was
speedily
banished
back
into
the
kitchen
mary
jealousy
of
hamlet
then
grew
apace
and
with
that
jealousy
unfortunately
her
secret
appreciation
of
his
splendours
she
could
not
help
admitting
to
herself
that
he
was
the
most
attractive
dog
in
the
world
she
would
look
at
him
from
under
her
spectacles
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
reading
and
watch
him
as
he
rolled
kicking
his
legs
in
the
air
or
lay
stretched
out
his
black
wet
nose
against
his
paws
his
eyes
gleaming
his
gaze
fixed
like
the
point
of
a
dagger
raised
to
strike
upon
some
trophy
or
enemy
or
spoil
or
sat
solemn
and
pompous
like
the
lord
mayor
holding
a
meeting
as
jeremy
said
up
against
his
master
leg
square
and
solid
as
though
he
were
cut
out
of
wood
his
peaked
beard
supercilious
his
very
ears
at
a
patronising
angle
or
as
mary
loved
best
of
all
to
see
him
when
he
was
simply
childish
playing
as
though
he
was
still
a
puppy
with
pieces
of
paper
or
balls
of
string
rolling
and
choking
growling
purring
staggering
and
tumbling
at
such
times
again
and
again
her
impulse
would
be
to
go
forward
and
applaud
him
and
then
the
instinct
that
she
would
be
checked
by
jeremy
stayed
her
she
knew
very
well
that
jeremy
realised
nothing
of
this
jeremy
was
not
given
to
the
consideration
of
other
people
motives
his
own
independence
saved
him
from
anxiety
about
others
he
had
the
english
characteristic
of
fancying
that
others
must
like
and
dislike
as
he
himself
liked
and
disliked
of
sentiment
he
had
no
knowledge
whatever
as
this
year
grew
towards
summer
mary
had
the
feeling
that
jeremy
was
slipping
away
from
her
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
old
days
he
had
asked
her
opinion
about
many
things
he
had
scorned
to
enjoy
the
long
stories
that
she
had
told
him
at
any
rate
he
had
listened
to
them
very
politely
and
he
had
asked
her
to
suggest
games
or
to
play
with
his
toys
now
as
the
summer
drew
near
he
did
none
of
these
things
he
was
frankly
impatient
with
her
stories
never
asked
her
advice
about
anything
and
never
played
with
her
was
he
growing
very
conceited
was
it
because
he
was
going
to
school
and
thought
himself
too
old
for
his
sisters
no
he
did
not
seem
to
be
conceited
he
had
always
been
proud
but
never
conceited
it
was
rather
as
though
he
had
lately
had
thoughts
of
his
own
almost
against
his
will
and
that
these
had
shut
him
off
from
the
people
round
him
then
when
their
mother
was
so
ill
and
barbara
made
her
startling
appearance
jeremy
kept
more
to
himself
he
never
talked
about
his
mother
illness
as
did
the
others
and
yet
mary
knew
that
he
had
been
more
deeply
concerned
than
any
of
them
she
had
been
miserable
of
course
but
to
jeremy
it
had
been
as
though
he
had
been
led
into
a
new
world
altogether
helen
and
she
were
still
in
their
old
places
and
jeremy
had
left
them
at
last
just
before
they
all
moved
to
cow
farm
mary
made
a
silly
scene
she
had
not
intended
to
make
a
scene
scenes
seemed
to
come
upon
her
like
evil
birds
straight
out
of
the
air
to
seize
her
before
she
knew
where
she
was
to
envelop
and
carry
her
up
with
them
at
last
when
all
the
mischief
was
done
to
set
her
on
her
feet
again
battered
torn
and
bitterly
ashamed
one
evening
she
was
sitting
deep
in
charlotte
mary
and
hamlet
bunched
up
against
his
master
leg
stared
at
her
she
had
long
ago
told
herself
that
it
was
ridiculous
to
mind
what
hamlet
did
that
he
was
not
looking
at
her
and
in
any
case
he
was
only
a
dog
and
so
on
but
she
was
tired
and
had
read
so
long
that
her
head
ached
hamlet
was
laughing
at
her
his
eyes
stared
through
his
hair
at
her
cynically
superciliously
contemptuously
his
lip
curled
and
his
beard
bristled
moved
by
a
sudden
wild
impulse
she
picked
up
the
chaplet
of
pearls
and
threw
it
at
him
it
hit
him
not
very
severely
and
he
gave
the
sharp
melodramatic
howl
that
he
always
used
when
it
was
his
dignity
rather
than
his
body
that
was
hurt
jeremy
looked
up
saw
what
had
happened
and
a
fine
scene
followed
mary
had
hysterics
stamped
and
screamed
and
howled
jeremy
his
face
white
stood
and
said
nothing
but
looked
as
though
he
hated
her
which
at
that
moment
he
undoubtedly
did
it
was
that
look
which
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
she
dreaded
she
made
herself
sick
with
crying
then
apologised
with
an
abjection
that
only
irritated
him
the
more
finally
remembered
the
smallest
details
of
the
affair
long
after
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
ii
during
the
first
weeks
at
cow
farm
mary
was
happy
she
had
then
many
especial
private
joys
such
as
climbing
into
one
of
the
old
apple
trees
behind
the
house
and
reading
there
safe
from
the
world
or
inventing
for
herself
wonderful
adventures
out
of
the
dark
glooms
and
sunlit
spaces
of
the
orchard
or
creeping
about
the
lofts
and
barns
as
though
they
were
full
of
the
most
desperate
dangers
and
hazards
that
she
alone
had
the
pluck
and
intelligence
to
overcome
then
monk
was
kind
to
her
and
listened
to
her
imaginative
chatter
with
a
most
marvellous
patience
mary
did
not
know
that
after
these
narrations
she
would
shake
her
head
and
say
to
her
husband
not
long
for
this
world
thinking
poor
worm
not
long
for
this
then
at
first
jeremy
was
kind
and
considerate
he
was
so
happy
that
he
did
not
mind
what
anyone
did
and
he
would
listen
to
mary
stories
quite
in
the
old
way
whistling
to
himself
not
thinking
about
her
at
all
perhaps
really
but
very
patient
after
the
first
fortnight
he
slipped
away
from
her
again
and
now
more
than
ever
before
he
went
off
for
long
walks
with
hamlet
refusing
to
take
her
with
them
he
answered
her
questions
so
vaguely
that
she
could
see
that
he
paid
her
no
attention
at
all
he
turned
upon
her
and
rent
her
if
she
complained
and
it
was
all
she
was
sure
that
horrible
dog
jeremy
was
always
with
hamlet
now
the
free
life
that
the
farm
gave
them
no
lessons
no
set
hours
no
care
for
appearances
left
them
to
choose
their
own
ways
and
so
developed
their
individualities
helen
was
now
more
and
more
with
her
elders
was
becoming
that
invaluable
thing
a
great
help
to
her
mother
and
even
to
her
own
inexhaustible
pride
paid
two
calls
with
cole
on
the
wives
of
neighbouring
farmers
then
barbara
absorbed
more
than
ever
of
helen
attention
and
mary
was
not
allowed
to
share
in
these
rites
and
services
because
she
always
made
barbara
she
was
therefore
very
much
alone
and
felt
all
her
injuries
twice
as
deeply
as
she
had
felt
them
before
hamlet
began
to
be
an
obsession
with
her
she
had
always
had
a
habit
of
talking
to
herself
and
now
she
could
be
heard
telling
herself
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
dog
jeremy
would
always
be
with
her
would
play
with
her
walk
with
her
laugh
with
her
as
he
used
to
do
she
acquired
now
an
awkward
habit
of
gazing
at
him
with
passionate
intensity
he
would
raise
his
eyes
and
find
the
great
spectacles
fixed
upon
him
with
a
beseeching
reproachful
glare
in
the
light
of
them
this
would
irritate
him
intensely
he
would
say
you
know
me
next
time
she
would
blush
crimson
and
then
with
trembling
mouth
answer
i
was
yes
you
no
i
of
course
you
were
staring
as
though
i
were
an
indian
or
chinaman
if
my
face
is
dirty
say
it
is
well
then
you
always
so
i
not
cross
only
you
so
silly
you
use
always
to
say
i
was
silly
now
you
always
do
every
so
you
then
as
he
saw
the
tears
coming
he
would
get
up
and
go
away
he
did
mean
to
be
unkind
to
her
he
was
fond
of
her
but
he
hated
scenes
mary
always
howling
about
something
now
he
confided
to
helen
is
she
helen
answered
with
indifference
mary
such
a
so
mary
began
to
attribute
everything
to
the
dog
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
she
met
the
animal
everywhere
cow
farm
was
a
rambling
building
with
dark
uneven
stairs
rooms
queer
odd
corners
and
sudden
unexpected
doors
it
seemed
to
mary
as
though
in
this
place
there
were
two
hamlets
when
in
the
evening
she
went
to
her
room
hurrying
through
the
passages
for
fear
of
what
she
might
see
stumbling
over
the
uneven
boards
sniffling
the
mice
and
straw
under
the
smell
of
her
tallow
candle
suddenly
out
of
nowhere
at
all
hamlet
would
appear
scurrying
along
like
the
white
rabbit
intent
on
serious
business
he
came
so
softly
and
with
so
sudden
a
flurry
and
scatter
when
she
did
hear
him
that
her
heart
would
beat
for
minutes
afterwards
and
she
would
not
dare
that
night
to
search
as
she
usually
did
for
burglars
under
her
bed
but
would
lie
quaking
hot
and
staring
unable
to
sleep
when
at
last
dreams
came
they
would
be
haunted
by
a
monstrous
dog
all
hair
and
eyes
who
with
padding
feet
would
track
her
round
and
round
a
room
from
which
there
was
no
escape
hamlet
being
one
of
the
wisest
of
dogs
very
quickly
discovered
that
mary
hated
him
he
was
not
a
sentimental
dog
and
he
did
not
devote
his
time
to
inventing
ways
in
which
he
might
placate
his
enemy
he
simply
avoided
her
but
he
could
not
hinder
a
certain
cynical
and
ironic
pleasure
that
he
had
of
so
to
speak
flaunting
his
master
in
her
face
he
clung
to
jeremy
more
resolutely
than
ever
would
jump
up
at
him
lick
his
hands
and
tumble
about
in
front
of
him
whenever
mary
was
there
and
then
suddenly
very
straight
and
very
grave
would
stare
at
her
as
though
he
were
the
most
devout
and
obedient
dog
in
the
place
indeed
he
bore
her
no
malice
he
could
afford
to
disregard
the
marys
of
this
world
and
of
women
in
general
he
had
a
poor
opinion
but
he
loved
to
tease
and
mary
was
an
easy
prey
he
had
his
fun
with
her
after
the
affair
of
the
jeremy
was
for
some
time
under
a
cloud
it
was
felt
that
he
was
getting
too
big
for
anyone
to
manage
it
was
not
that
he
was
wicked
not
that
he
kept
bad
company
with
the
boys
on
the
farm
or
was
dishonest
or
told
lies
or
stole
things
no
he
gave
no
one
that
kind
of
anxiety
but
that
he
was
developing
quite
unmistakably
a
will
of
his
own
and
had
a
remarkable
way
of
doing
what
he
wanted
without
being
actually
disobedient
which
was
very
puzzling
to
his
elders
being
a
little
in
disgrace
he
went
off
more
than
ever
by
himself
always
appearing
again
at
the
appointed
time
but
telling
no
one
where
he
had
been
or
what
he
had
been
doing
his
father
had
no
influence
over
him
at
all
whilst
uncle
samuel
could
make
him
do
whatever
he
wanted
and
this
as
aunt
amy
said
was
really
a
it
a
good
thing
he
going
to
school
in
september
sighed
his
mother
he
getting
out
of
women
mary
longed
with
feverish
longing
to
share
in
his
adventures
if
only
he
would
tell
her
what
he
did
on
these
walks
of
his
but
no
only
hamlet
knew
perhaps
if
he
did
not
go
with
the
dog
he
would
go
with
her
when
this
idea
crept
into
her
brain
she
seized
it
and
clutched
it
that
was
all
he
wanted
a
companion
were
hamlet
not
there
he
would
take
her
were
hamlet
not
there
she
began
to
brood
over
this
she
wandered
she
considered
she
shuddered
at
her
own
wickedness
she
tried
to
drive
the
thoughts
from
her
head
but
they
kept
coming
after
all
no
one
need
know
for
a
day
or
two
jeremy
would
be
sorry
and
then
he
would
forget
she
knew
the
man
who
went
round
selling
dogs
selling
dogs
and
buying
them
she
shuddered
at
her
wickedness
iii
the
last
days
of
august
came
and
with
them
the
last
week
of
the
holiday
already
there
was
a
scent
of
autumn
in
the
air
leaves
were
turning
gold
and
red
and
the
evenings
came
cool
and
sudden
upon
the
hot
summer
afternoons
mary
was
not
very
well
she
had
caught
a
cold
somewhere
and
existed
in
the
irritating
condition
of
going
out
one
day
and
being
held
indoors
the
next
this
upset
her
temper
and
at
night
she
had
nightmares
in
which
she
saw
clouds
of
smoke
crawling
in
at
her
window
snakes
on
the
floor
and
crimson
flames
darting
at
her
from
the
ceiling
it
was
because
she
was
in
an
abnormal
condition
of
health
that
the
idea
of
doing
something
with
hamlet
had
gained
such
a
hold
upon
her
she
considered
the
matter
from
every
point
of
view
she
did
not
want
to
be
cruel
to
the
dog
she
supposed
that
after
a
week
or
two
he
would
be
quite
happy
with
his
new
master
and
in
any
case
he
had
strolled
in
so
casually
upon
the
cole
family
that
he
was
accustomed
to
a
wandering
life
she
did
not
intend
that
anyone
should
know
it
was
to
be
a
deep
secret
all
of
her
own
jeremy
was
going
to
school
in
september
and
before
then
she
must
make
him
friendly
to
her
again
she
saw
stretching
in
front
of
her
all
the
lonely
autumn
without
him
and
her
own
memories
of
the
miserable
summer
to
make
her
wretched
she
was
an
extremely
sentimental
little
girl
as
always
happens
when
one
is
meditating
with
a
placated
conscience
a
wicked
deed
the
opportunity
was
suddenly
offered
to
mary
of
achieving
her
purpose
one
morning
jeremy
after
refusing
to
listen
to
one
of
mary
long
romances
lost
his
temper
i
ca
stop
he
said
you
bother
and
bother
and
bother
aunt
amy
says
you
nearly
make
her
i
do
care
what
aunt
amy
says
mary
on
the
edge
of
tears
replied
hamlet
and
i
are
going
out
and
i
sick
of
your
silly
old
then
he
suddenly
stopped
and
gazed
at
mary
who
was
beginning
as
usual
to
weep
look
here
mary
what
been
the
matter
with
you
lately
you
always
crying
now
or
something
and
you
look
at
me
as
though
i
done
something
dreadful
i
have
done
i
never
said
you
had
mary
gulped
out
he
rubbed
his
nose
in
a
way
that
he
had
when
he
was
puzzled
if
it
anything
i
do
tell
me
it
so
silly
always
crying
the
holidays
will
be
over
soon
and
you
done
nothing
but
you
never
with
me
now
mary
sobbed
well
i
been
you
have
you
ca
be
busy
all
by
oh
yes
you
he
was
getting
impatient
anyway
you
might
let
hamlet
and
me
alone
you
always
bothering
one
of
no
i
she
choked
an
enormous
sob
and
burst
out
with
always
hamlet
now
i
wish
he
never
come
it
was
much
nicer
then
he
lost
his
temper
oh
you
a
baby
i
sick
of
you
and
your
nonsense
he
cried
and
stamped
off
in
mary
eyes
as
she
watched
him
go
determination
grew
it
happened
that
upon
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
miss
jones
announced
that
she
would
take
mary
for
a
walk
then
just
as
they
passed
through
the
farm
gates
hamlet
rushing
out
joined
them
he
did
not
often
honour
them
with
his
company
despising
women
most
especially
when
they
walked
but
his
master
was
busy
digging
for
worms
in
the
vegetable
garden
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
contemplation
of
this
fascinating
occupation
he
had
wandered
off
in
search
of
a
livelier
game
he
decided
to
join
miss
jones
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
he
could
amuse
himself
with
her
ineffectual
attempts
to
keep
him
in
order
and
he
could
irritate
mary
so
he
danced
along
with
his
tail
in
the
air
barking
at
imaginary
rats
and
poking
his
nose
into
hedges
mary
with
a
sudden
tightened
clutching
of
the
heart
realised
that
her
hour
was
upon
her
she
felt
so
wicked
as
she
realised
this
that
she
wondered
that
the
ground
did
open
up
and
swallow
her
as
it
had
done
with
those
unfortunate
people
in
the
bible
but
no
the
world
was
calm
little
white
milky
clouds
raced
in
lines
and
circles
across
the
sky
and
once
and
again
a
leaf
floated
from
a
tree
hung
for
a
moment
suspended
and
then
turned
slowly
to
the
ground
the
hedges
were
a
dark
high
and
thick
above
the
dusty
road
there
had
been
no
rain
for
weeks
truly
a
stable
world
mary
glaring
at
fate
wondered
how
it
could
be
so
miss
jones
who
was
happy
and
optimistic
talked
in
a
tenderly
reminiscent
tone
of
her
youth
this
vein
of
reminiscence
mary
on
her
normal
day
loved
she
did
not
hear
a
word
that
miss
jones
said
i
remember
my
mother
saying
so
well
to
my
dear
brother
what
you
like
my
boy
i
trust
you
and
indeed
alfred
was
to
be
trusted
if
ever
a
boy
was
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
but
i
can
not
remember
a
single
occasion
of
dishonesty
on
alfred
part
white
lie
he
would
often
say
a
lie
and
a
lie
is
a
sin
white
or
black
always
a
sin
and
i
remember
that
he
would
often
put
mother
to
a
serious
inconvenience
by
his
telling
callers
that
she
was
in
when
she
had
wished
it
to
be
said
that
she
was
not
at
home
he
felt
it
his
serious
duty
and
so
he
told
mother
ask
me
to
tell
a
lie
mother
i
remember
his
saying
can
not
do
it
like
george
washington
said
mary
suddenly
catching
the
last
words
of
miss
jones
sentence
he
was
like
many
famous
characters
in
history
i
used
to
think
once
i
remember
reading
about
oliver
cromwell
is
that
dog
hamlet
hamlet
perhaps
he
gone
after
the
sheep
ah
there
he
is
hamlet
you
naughty
dog
they
were
approaching
one
of
their
favourite
pieces
of
country
mellot
wood
here
on
the
wood
edge
the
ground
broke
away
running
down
in
a
field
of
corn
to
a
little
green
valley
with
clustered
trees
that
showed
only
their
heads
so
thickly
embedded
were
they
and
beyond
the
valley
the
sea
the
sea
looked
quite
close
here
although
it
was
in
reality
four
miles
distant
never
was
such
a
place
as
this
view
for
light
and
shadow
the
clouds
raced
like
the
black
wings
of
enormous
birds
across
the
light
green
valley
and
the
of
the
cornfield
was
tossed
into
the
haze
and
swept
like
a
golden
shadow
across
the
earth
bending
back
again
when
the
breeze
had
died
behind
mellot
wood
was
mellot
farm
an
old
house
about
which
there
was
a
fine
tragic
story
with
a
murder
and
a
ghost
in
it
and
this
of
course
gave
mellot
wood
an
additional
charm
when
they
arrived
at
the
outskirts
of
mellot
wood
mary
looked
about
her
it
was
here
on
the
edge
of
the
rafiel
road
that
skirted
the
wood
that
she
had
once
seen
the
eating
his
luncheon
out
of
a
red
there
was
no
sign
of
him
all
was
silent
and
still
only
the
little
wood
uttered
little
sighs
of
content
beneath
the
flying
clouds
hamlet
tired
with
his
racing
after
imaginary
rabbits
walked
quietly
along
by
mary
side
what
was
she
to
do
she
had
once
again
the
desperate
feeling
that
something
stronger
than
she
had
swept
down
upon
her
and
was
forcing
her
to
do
this
thing
she
seemed
to
have
no
will
of
her
own
but
to
be
watching
some
other
commit
an
act
whose
dangerous
wickedness
froze
her
heart
how
could
she
but
she
must
someone
was
doing
it
for
her
and
in
very
truth
it
seemed
so
miss
jones
said
that
now
they
were
here
she
might
as
well
call
upon
miss
andrews
the
sister
of
the
mellot
farmer
miss
andrews
had
promised
her
some
ducks
eggs
they
pushed
open
the
farm
gate
passed
across
the
yard
and
knocked
on
the
house
door
near
mary
was
a
large
barn
with
a
heavy
door
now
ajar
hamlet
sat
gazing
pensively
at
a
flock
of
geese
his
tongue
out
panting
contentedly
wait
here
one
minute
mary
said
miss
jones
i
wo
miss
jones
disappeared
mary
still
under
the
strange
sense
that
it
was
not
she
but
another
who
did
these
things
moved
back
to
the
barn
calling
softly
to
hamlet
he
followed
her
sniffing
a
rat
somewhere
very
quickly
she
pulled
back
the
door
he
still
investigating
his
rat
followed
into
the
dark
excitements
of
the
barn
with
a
quick
movement
she
bent
down
slipped
off
his
collar
which
she
hid
in
her
dress
then
shut
him
in
she
knew
that
for
a
moment
or
two
he
would
still
be
pursuing
his
rat
and
she
saw
with
guilty
relief
miss
jones
come
out
to
her
just
as
she
had
finished
her
evil
deed
miss
andrews
is
out
said
miss
jones
they
are
all
away
at
liskane
they
left
the
farm
and
walked
down
the
road
hamlet
had
not
begun
his
cry
iv
miss
jones
was
pleased
such
a
nice
servant
she
said
one
of
the
old
kind
she
had
been
with
the
family
fifty
years
she
told
me
and
had
nursed
andrews
on
her
knee
fancy
such
a
large
fat
man
as
he
is
now
too
much
beer
i
suppose
i
suppose
they
get
so
thirsty
with
all
the
straw
and
hay
about
yes
a
really
nice
woman
she
told
me
that
there
was
no
place
in
glebeshire
to
touch
them
for
cream
i
dare
say
they
right
after
all
you
never
can
tell
i
remember
at
home
she
broke
off
then
and
cried
where
hamlet
mary
wickeder
than
ever
stared
through
her
spectacles
down
the
road
i
do
know
miss
jones
she
said
they
had
left
the
wood
and
the
farm
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
long
white
ribbon
of
road
hemmed
in
by
the
high
hedges
perhaps
he
stayed
behind
at
the
farm
said
miss
jones
then
mary
told
her
worst
lie
oh
no
miss
jones
he
ran
past
us
just
now
did
you
see
him
no
i
did
he
gone
on
ahead
i
suppose
he
runs
home
sometimes
naughty
dog
we
shall
catch
him
but
of
course
they
did
not
they
passed
through
the
gates
of
cow
farm
and
still
nothing
of
hamlet
was
to
be
seen
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
miss
jones
i
do
hope
that
he
arrived
whatever
will
jeremy
say
if
anything
has
gone
wrong
mary
was
breathing
hard
now
as
though
she
had
been
running
a
desperate
race
she
would
at
this
moment
have
given
all
that
she
possessed
or
all
that
she
was
ever
likely
to
possess
to
recall
her
deed
if
she
could
have
seen
hamlet
rushing
down
the
road
towards
her
she
would
have
cried
with
relief
there
seemed
now
to
be
suddenly
removed
from
her
that
outside
agency
that
had
forced
her
to
do
this
thing
now
having
compelled
her
it
had
withdrawn
and
left
her
to
carry
the
consequences
strangely
confused
in
her
sentimental
soul
was
her
terror
of
wrath
and
her
own
picture
of
the
wretched
hamlet
barking
his
heart
out
frightened
thirsty
and
lonely
her
teeth
began
to
chatter
she
clenched
her
hands
together
miss
jones
went
across
the
courtyard
calling
hamlet
hamlet
the
family
was
collected
having
just
sat
down
to
tea
so
that
the
announcement
received
its
full
measure
of
excitement
has
hamlet
come
back
we
thought
he
was
ahead
of
a
chair
had
tumbled
over
jeremy
had
run
round
the
table
to
miss
jones
what
that
hamlet
where
is
he
we
thought
he
must
be
ahead
of
us
he
ran
past
us
down
the
road
and
we
thought
they
thought
silly
women
jeremy
as
though
he
were
challenging
a
god
stood
up
against
miss
jones
hurling
questions
at
her
where
had
they
been
what
road
had
they
taken
had
they
gone
into
the
wood
whereabouts
had
he
run
past
them
i
do
know
said
miss
jones
to
this
last
i
did
see
him
mary
jeremy
turned
upon
mary
where
was
it
you
saw
him
she
could
speak
her
tongue
would
move
her
lips
would
open
she
could
but
waggle
her
head
like
an
idiot
she
saw
nothing
but
his
face
it
was
a
desperate
face
she
knew
so
much
better
than
all
the
others
what
the
thought
of
losing
hamlet
was
to
him
it
was
part
of
the
harshness
of
her
fate
that
she
should
understand
him
so
much
better
than
the
others
did
but
she
herself
had
not
realised
how
hardly
he
would
take
it
i
did
i
could
there
the
he
stammered
he
have
stolen
then
he
was
off
out
of
the
room
in
an
instant
and
that
was
more
than
mary
could
hear
she
realised
even
as
she
followed
him
that
she
was
giving
her
whole
case
away
that
she
was
now
as
always
weak
when
she
should
be
strong
soft
when
she
should
be
hard
good
when
she
should
be
wicked
wicked
when
she
should
be
good
she
could
not
help
herself
with
trembling
limbs
and
a
heart
that
seemed
to
be
hammering
her
body
into
pieces
she
followed
him
out
she
found
him
in
the
hall
tugging
at
his
coat
where
are
you
going
she
said
weakly
going
he
answered
fiercely
where
do
you
think
he
glared
at
her
just
like
he
broke
off
suddenly
appealing
to
her
mary
you
remember
it
will
be
getting
dark
soon
and
if
we
have
to
wait
until
the
will
have
got
him
at
any
rate
he
had
his
collar
then
mary
broke
out
she
burst
into
sobs
pushed
her
hand
into
her
dress
and
held
out
the
collar
to
him
there
it
is
there
it
is
she
said
hysterically
you
got
it
he
stared
at
her
suspicion
slowly
coming
to
him
but
how
what
have
you
done
she
looked
up
at
him
the
tears
making
dirty
lines
on
her
face
her
hand
out
towards
him
i
took
it
off
i
shut
hamlet
into
the
barn
at
mellot
farm
i
wanted
him
to
be
lost
i
did
want
you
to
have
him
i
hated
him
always
being
with
you
and
me
jeremy
moved
back
and
at
the
sudden
look
in
his
eyes
her
sobbing
ceased
she
caught
her
breath
and
stared
at
him
with
a
silly
fixed
stare
as
a
rabbit
quivers
before
a
snake
jeremy
said
in
his
ordinary
voice
you
shut
hamlet
up
you
did
want
him
to
be
found
she
nodded
her
head
several
times
as
though
now
she
must
convince
him
quickly
of
this
yes
yes
yes
i
did
i
know
i
should
but
i
could
help
it
he
clutched
her
arm
and
then
shook
her
with
a
sudden
wave
of
fierce
physical
anger
that
was
utterly
unlike
him
and
therefore
the
more
terrifying
you
wicked
wicked
you
beast
mary
she
could
only
sob
her
head
hanging
down
he
let
her
go
what
barn
was
it
she
described
the
place
he
gave
her
another
look
of
contempt
and
then
rushed
off
running
across
the
courtyard
there
was
still
no
one
in
the
hall
she
could
go
up
to
her
room
without
the
fear
of
being
disturbed
she
found
the
room
all
white
and
black
now
with
the
gathering
dusk
beyond
the
window
the
evening
breeze
was
rustling
in
the
dark
trees
of
the
garden
and
the
boom
of
the
sea
could
be
heard
faintly
mary
sat
where
she
always
sat
when
she
was
unhappy
inside
the
wardrobe
with
her
head
amongst
the
clothes
they
in
some
way
comforted
her
she
was
not
so
lonely
with
them
nor
did
she
feel
so
strongly
the
empty
distances
of
the
long
room
the
white
light
of
the
nor
the
mysterious
secrecy
of
the
high
elms
knocking
their
heads
together
in
the
garden
outside
she
had
a
fit
of
hysterical
crying
biting
the
hanging
clothes
between
her
teeth
feeling
suddenly
sick
and
tired
and
exhausted
with
flaming
eyes
and
a
dry
parched
throat
why
had
she
ever
done
such
a
thing
she
loving
jeremy
as
she
did
would
he
ever
forgive
her
no
never
she
saw
that
in
his
face
perhaps
he
would
if
he
found
hamlet
quickly
and
came
back
perhaps
hamlet
never
would
be
found
then
jeremy
heart
would
be
broken
she
slept
from
utter
exhaustion
and
was
so
found
when
the
room
was
quite
dark
and
only
shadows
moved
in
it
by
her
mother
why
mary
said
cole
what
are
you
doing
here
we
could
think
where
you
were
and
where
jeremy
jeremy
she
started
up
remembering
everything
has
he
come
back
oh
he
lost
and
he
be
killed
and
it
will
be
all
my
fault
she
burst
into
another
fit
of
wild
hysterical
crying
her
mother
took
her
arm
mary
explain
what
have
you
done
mary
explained
her
teeth
chattering
her
head
aching
so
that
she
could
not
see
and
you
shut
him
up
like
that
whatever
oh
mary
you
wicked
girl
and
jeremy
he
been
away
two
hours
now
she
turned
off
leaving
mary
alone
in
the
black
room
mary
was
left
to
every
terror
that
can
beset
a
lonely
hysterical
child
terror
of
jeremy
fate
terror
of
hamlet
loss
terror
of
her
own
crimes
above
all
terror
of
the
lonely
room
the
waving
elms
and
the
gathering
dark
she
could
not
move
she
could
not
even
close
the
door
of
the
wardrobe
into
whose
shelter
she
had
again
crept
she
stared
at
the
white
sheet
of
the
window
with
its
black
bars
like
railings
and
its
ghostly
hinting
of
a
moon
that
would
soon
be
up
above
the
trees
every
noise
frightened
her
the
working
of
the
separator
in
a
distant
part
of
the
farm
the
whistling
of
some
out
in
the
yard
the
voice
of
some
boy
faintly
the
lingering
echo
of
the
vanished
day
all
these
seemed
to
accuse
her
to
point
fingers
at
her
to
warn
her
of
some
awful
impending
punishment
ah
you
the
little
girl
they
seemed
to
say
who
lost
jeremy
dog
and
broke
she
was
sure
that
someone
was
beneath
her
bed
that
old
terror
haunted
her
with
an
almost
humorous
persistency
every
night
before
she
went
to
sleep
but
there
was
a
ghastly
certainty
and
imminence
about
it
that
froze
her
blood
she
crouched
up
against
the
hanging
skirts
gazing
at
the
black
line
between
the
floor
and
the
white
sheets
expecting
at
every
second
to
see
a
protruding
black
mask
bloodshot
eyes
a
coarse
hand
the
memory
of
the
burglary
that
they
had
had
in
the
spring
came
upon
her
with
redoubled
force
ah
surely
surely
someone
was
there
she
heard
a
movement
a
scraping
of
a
boot
upon
the
floor
the
thick
hurried
breathing
of
some
desperate
villain
then
these
fears
gave
way
to
something
worse
than
them
all
the
certainty
that
jeremy
was
dead
ridiculous
pictures
passed
before
her
of
jeremy
hanging
from
a
tree
jeremy
lying
frozen
in
the
wood
the
faithful
hamlet
dead
at
his
side
jeremy
stung
by
an
adder
and
succumbing
to
his
horrible
tortures
jeremy
surrounded
by
violent
men
who
snatched
hamlet
from
him
beat
him
on
the
head
and
left
him
for
dead
on
the
ground
she
passed
what
seemed
to
her
hours
of
torture
under
these
horrible
imaginings
tired
out
almost
out
of
her
mind
with
the
hysteria
of
her
loneliness
her
imagination
and
her
conscience
she
passed
into
a
kind
of
apathy
of
unhappiness
thinking
now
only
of
jeremy
longing
for
him
beseeching
him
to
come
back
telling
the
empty
moonlit
room
that
she
never
meant
it
that
she
would
do
everything
he
wanted
if
only
he
came
back
to
her
that
she
was
a
wicked
girl
that
she
would
never
be
wicked
again
and
she
took
her
punishment
alone
after
endless
ages
of
darkness
and
terror
and
misery
she
heard
voices
then
his
voice
she
jumped
out
of
the
wardrobe
and
listened
yes
it
was
his
voice
she
pushed
back
the
door
crept
down
the
passage
and
came
suddenly
upon
a
little
group
with
jeremy
in
its
midst
crowded
together
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
jeremy
was
wrapped
up
in
his
heavy
coat
and
looked
very
small
and
impish
as
he
peered
from
out
of
it
he
was
greatly
excited
his
eyes
shining
his
mouth
smiling
his
cheeks
flushed
his
audience
consisted
of
helen
cole
miss
jones
and
aunt
amy
he
described
to
them
how
he
had
run
along
the
road
for
miles
and
miles
and
miles
how
at
last
he
had
found
the
farm
had
rung
the
bell
and
inquired
and
discovered
hamlet
licking
up
sugary
tea
in
the
farm
kitchen
there
had
then
been
a
rapturous
meeting
and
he
had
boldly
declared
that
he
could
find
his
way
home
again
without
aid
they
wanted
me
to
be
driven
home
in
their
trap
but
i
was
going
to
have
that
they
been
at
the
fair
all
day
and
did
want
to
go
out
again
i
could
see
so
he
and
hamlet
started
gaily
on
their
walk
home
and
then
in
some
way
or
another
he
took
the
wrong
turn
and
suddenly
they
were
in
mellot
wood
it
was
dark
as
anything
you
know
although
there
was
going
to
be
a
moon
we
could
see
a
thing
and
then
i
got
loster
and
loster
at
last
we
just
sat
under
a
tree
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
then
apparently
jeremy
had
slept
and
had
finally
been
found
in
the
proper
romantic
manner
by
jim
and
his
father
well
all
well
that
ends
well
said
aunt
amy
with
a
sniff
in
spite
of
that
momentary
softness
over
the
defeat
of
the
dean
ernest
she
liked
her
young
nephew
no
better
than
of
old
she
had
desired
that
he
should
be
punished
for
this
but
as
she
looked
at
the
melting
eyes
of
cole
and
miss
jones
she
had
very
little
hope
mary
was
forgotten
no
one
noticed
her
bed
said
cole
really
what
a
terrible
affair
said
miss
jones
and
i
ca
help
feeling
that
it
was
my
what
mary
began
cole
and
then
she
stopped
she
had
perhaps
some
sense
that
mary
had
already
received
sufficient
punishment
mary
waited
standing
against
the
passage
wall
jeremy
who
had
not
seen
her
vanished
into
his
room
she
waited
then
plucking
up
all
her
courage
with
the
desperate
suffocating
sense
of
a
prisoner
laying
himself
beneath
the
guillotine
she
knocked
timidly
on
his
door
he
said
come
in
and
entering
she
saw
him
in
his
braces
standing
on
a
chair
trying
to
put
the
picture
entitled
daddy
christmas
straight
upon
its
nail
the
sight
of
this
familiar
task
the
picture
would
never
hang
straight
although
every
day
jeremy
who
strangely
enough
had
an
eye
to
such
matters
tried
to
correct
it
cheered
her
a
little
wo
it
go
straight
she
said
feebly
no
it
wo
he
began
and
then
suddenly
realising
the
whole
position
stopped
i
sorry
jeremy
she
muttered
hanging
her
head
down
oh
that
all
right
he
answered
turning
away
from
her
and
pulling
at
the
string
it
was
a
beastly
thing
to
do
all
the
same
he
added
will
you
forgive
me
she
asked
oh
there
is
any
forgiveness
about
it
girls
are
queer
i
suppose
i
do
understand
them
myself
there
that
better
i
say
it
was
simply
beastly
under
that
tree
was
it
beastly
there
was
something
howling
somewhere
a
cat
or
you
do
forgive
me
do
you
yes
yes
i
say
is
that
right
now
oh
it
wo
stay
there
it
the
wall
or
he
came
down
from
the
chair
yawning
jim
nice
he
confided
to
her
he
going
to
take
me
ratting
one
day
i
going
mary
said
again
and
waited
jeremy
coloured
looked
as
though
he
would
say
something
then
in
silence
presented
a
very
grimy
cheek
he
said
with
an
air
of
intense
relief
she
said
kissing
him
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
knew
that
the
worst
had
happened
he
had
passed
away
utterly
beyond
her
company
her
world
her
interests
she
crept
along
to
her
room
and
there
with
a
determination
and
a
strength
rare
in
a
child
so
young
and
so
undisciplined
faced
her
loneliness
chapter
xi
the
i
the
holidays
were
over
the
coles
were
once
more
back
in
polchester
and
the
most
exciting
period
of
jeremy
life
had
begun
so
at
any
rate
he
felt
it
it
might
be
that
in
later
years
there
would
be
new
exciting
events
for
instance
or
a
war
or
the
tracking
of
niggers
in
the
heart
of
africa
he
would
be
ready
for
them
when
they
came
but
these
last
weeks
before
his
first
departure
for
school
offered
him
the
prospect
of
the
first
real
independence
of
his
life
there
could
never
be
anything
quite
like
that
again
nevertheless
school
seemed
still
a
long
way
distant
it
was
only
his
manliness
that
he
was
realising
and
a
certain
impatience
and
restlessness
that
underlay
everything
that
he
did
september
and
october
are
often
very
lovely
months
in
polchester
autumn
seems
to
come
there
with
a
greater
warmth
and
richness
than
it
does
elsewhere
along
all
the
reaches
of
the
pol
right
down
to
the
sea
the
leaves
of
the
woods
hung
with
a
riotous
magnificence
that
is
glorious
in
its
recklessness
the
waters
of
that
silent
river
are
so
still
so
glassy
that
the
banks
of
gold
and
flaming
red
are
reflected
in
all
their
richest
colour
down
into
the
very
heart
of
the
stream
and
it
is
only
when
a
fish
jumps
or
a
twig
falls
from
the
overhanging
trees
that
the
mirror
is
broken
and
the
colours
flash
into
ripples
and
shadows
of
white
and
grey
the
utter
silence
of
all
this
world
makes
the
cathedral
town
sleepy
sluggish
forgotten
of
all
men
as
the
autumn
comes
it
seems
to
drowse
away
into
winter
to
the
tune
of
its
cathedral
bells
to
the
scent
of
its
burning
leaves
and
the
soft
steps
of
its
canons
and
clergy
there
is
every
autumn
here
a
clerical
conference
and
long
before
the
appointed
week
begins
and
long
after
it
is
lawfully
concluded
clergymen
strange
clergymen
with
soft
black
hats
take
the
town
for
their
own
gaze
into
martin
the
sit
in
the
dusk
of
the
cathedral
listening
to
the
organ
walk
their
heads
in
air
their
arms
folded
behind
their
backs
straight
up
orange
street
as
though
they
were
scaling
heaven
itself
stop
little
children
pat
their
heads
and
give
them
pennies
stand
outside
poole
bookshop
and
delve
in
the
box
for
sermons
stand
gazing
in
learned
fashion
at
the
great
west
door
investigating
the
saints
and
apostles
portrayed
thereon
hurry
in
their
best
hats
and
coats
along
the
close
to
some
ladies
or
pass
with
solemn
and
anxious
mien
into
the
palace
of
the
bishop
himself
all
these
things
belong
to
autumn
in
polchester
as
jeremy
very
well
knew
but
the
event
that
marks
the
true
beginning
of
the
season
the
only
way
by
which
you
may
surely
know
that
summer
is
over
and
autumn
is
come
is
pauper
fair
this
famous
fair
has
been
from
time
immemorial
a
noted
event
in
glebeshire
life
even
now
when
fairs
have
yielded
to
cinematographs
as
attractions
for
the
people
pauper
fair
gives
its
annual
excitement
thirty
years
ago
it
was
the
greatest
event
of
the
year
in
polchester
all
our
fine
people
of
course
disliked
it
extremely
it
disturbed
the
town
for
days
the
town
rocked
in
the
arms
of
crowds
of
drunken
sailors
the
town
gave
shelter
to
gipsies
and
rogues
and
scoundrels
the
town
the
decent
amiable
happy
town
actually
for
a
week
or
so
seemed
to
invite
the
world
of
the
blazing
fire
and
the
dancing
clown
no
wonder
that
our
fine
people
shuddered
only
the
other
day
i
speak
now
of
these
modern
times
the
bishop
tried
to
stop
the
whole
business
he
wrote
to
the
glebeshire
morning
news
urging
that
pauper
fair
in
these
days
of
enlightenment
and
culture
can
not
but
be
regretted
by
all
those
who
have
the
healthy
progress
of
our
dear
country
at
heart
well
you
would
be
amazed
at
the
storm
that
his
protest
raised
people
wrote
from
all
over
the
county
and
there
were
ultimately
letters
from
patriotic
glebeshire
citizens
in
new
zealand
and
south
africa
and
in
polchester
itself
everyone
even
those
who
had
shuddered
most
at
the
iniquities
was
indignant
give
up
the
fair
one
of
the
few
signs
left
of
that
jolly
old
england
whose
sentiment
is
cherished
by
us
whose
fragments
nevertheless
we
so
readily
stamp
upon
no
the
fair
must
remain
and
will
remain
i
have
no
doubt
until
the
very
end
of
our
national
chapter
nowadays
it
has
shed
very
largely
i
am
afraid
the
character
that
it
gloriously
maintained
thirty
years
ago
then
it
was
really
an
invasion
by
the
seafaring
element
of
the
county
all
the
little
country
ports
and
harbours
poured
out
their
fishermen
and
sailors
who
came
walking
driving
singing
laughing
swearing
they
filled
the
streets
and
went
peering
like
the
wildest
of
ancient
picts
into
the
mysterious
beauties
of
the
cathedral
and
late
at
night
when
the
town
should
have
slept
arm
in
arm
they
went
roaring
past
the
dark
windows
singing
their
songs
stamping
their
feet
and
every
once
and
again
ringing
a
decent
for
their
amusement
it
was
very
seldom
that
any
harm
was
done
once
a
serious
fire
broke
out
amongst
the
old
wooden
houses
down
on
the
river
and
some
of
them
were
burnt
to
the
ground
a
fate
that
no
one
deplored
once
a
sailor
was
murdered
in
a
drunken
squabble
at
the
dog
and
pilchard
the
wildest
of
the
riverside
hostelries
and
once
a
canon
was
caught
and
stripped
and
ducked
in
the
waters
of
the
pol
by
a
mob
who
resented
his
gentle
appeals
that
they
should
try
to
prefer
lemonade
to
gin
but
these
were
the
only
three
catastrophes
in
all
the
history
of
the
fair
during
the
fair
week
the
town
sniffed
of
the
sea
of
lobster
and
seaweed
and
tar
and
brine
and
all
the
tales
of
the
sea
that
have
ever
been
told
by
man
were
told
during
these
days
in
polchester
the
decent
people
kept
their
doors
locked
their
children
at
home
and
their
valuables
in
the
family
safe
no
upper
class
child
in
polchester
so
much
as
saw
the
outside
of
a
gipsy
van
the
dean
ernest
was
accustomed
to
boast
that
he
had
once
been
given
a
ride
by
a
gipsy
on
a
donkey
when
his
nurse
was
not
looking
but
no
one
credited
the
story
and
the
details
with
which
he
supported
it
were
feeble
and
unconvincing
the
polchester
children
in
general
were
told
that
they
would
be
stolen
by
the
gipsies
if
they
were
careful
and
although
some
of
them
in
extreme
moments
of
rebellion
and
depression
felt
that
the
life
of
adventure
thus
offered
to
them
might
after
all
be
more
agreeable
than
the
dreary
realism
of
their
natural
days
the
warning
may
be
said
to
have
been
effective
no
family
in
polchester
was
guarded
more
carefully
in
this
matter
of
the
pauper
fair
than
the
cole
family
cole
had
an
absolute
horror
of
the
fair
sailors
and
gipsies
were
to
him
the
sign
and
seal
of
utter
damnation
and
although
he
tried
as
a
christian
clergyman
to
believe
that
they
deserved
pity
because
of
the
disadvantages
under
which
they
had
from
the
first
laboured
he
confessed
to
his
intimate
friends
that
he
saw
very
little
hope
for
them
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
jeremy
helen
and
mary
were
during
fair
week
kept
severely
within
doors
their
exercise
had
to
be
taken
in
the
cole
garden
and
the
farthest
that
they
poked
their
noses
into
the
town
was
their
visit
to
john
on
sunday
morning
except
on
one
famous
occasion
the
fair
week
of
jeremy
fifth
year
saw
him
writhing
under
a
terrible
attack
of
toothache
which
became
after
two
agonised
nights
such
a
torment
and
distress
to
the
whole
household
that
he
had
to
be
conveyed
to
the
house
of
pilter
who
had
his
at
no
market
square
it
is
true
that
jeremy
was
conveyed
thither
in
a
cab
and
that
his
pain
and
his
darkened
windows
prevented
him
from
seeing
very
much
of
the
gay
world
nevertheless
in
spite
of
the
jampot
who
guarded
him
like
a
dragon
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
flags
a
gleaming
brass
band
and
a
punch
and
judy
show
and
he
heard
the
trumpets
and
the
drum
and
the
shouts
of
excited
little
boys
and
the
blowing
of
the
punch
and
judy
pipes
and
he
smelt
roasting
chestnuts
bad
tobacco
and
beer
and
gin
he
returned
young
as
he
was
and
reduced
to
a
condition
by
the
rough
but
kindly
intentioned
services
of
pilter
with
the
picture
of
a
hysterical
abandoned
world
clearly
imprinted
upon
his
brain
i
want
to
go
he
said
to
the
jampot
you
ca
said
she
i
will
when
i
six
said
he
you
wo
said
she
i
will
when
i
seven
said
he
you
wo
said
she
i
will
when
i
eight
he
answered
oh
give
over
do
master
jeremy
said
she
and
now
he
was
eight
very
nearly
nine
and
going
to
school
in
a
fortnight
there
seemed
to
be
a
touch
of
destiny
about
his
prophecy
ii
he
had
no
intention
of
disobedience
had
he
been
once
definitely
told
by
someone
in
authority
that
he
was
not
to
go
to
the
fair
he
would
not
have
dreamt
of
going
he
had
no
intention
of
disobedience
but
he
had
returned
from
the
cow
farm
holiday
in
a
strange
condition
of
mind
he
had
found
there
this
summer
more
freedom
than
he
had
been
ever
allowed
in
his
life
before
and
it
had
been
freedom
that
had
come
not
so
much
from
any
change
of
rules
but
rather
from
his
own
attitude
to
the
family
simply
he
had
wanted
to
do
certain
things
and
he
had
done
them
and
the
family
had
stood
aside
he
began
to
be
aware
that
he
had
only
to
push
and
things
gave
way
a
dangerous
knowledge
and
its
coming
marks
a
period
in
one
life
he
seemed
too
during
this
summer
to
have
left
his
sisters
definitely
behind
him
and
to
stand
much
more
alone
than
he
had
done
before
the
only
person
in
his
world
whom
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
know
better
was
uncle
samuel
and
that
argued
on
his
part
a
certain
tendency
towards
rebellion
and
individuality
he
was
no
longer
rude
to
aunt
although
he
hated
her
just
as
he
had
always
done
she
did
not
seem
any
longer
a
question
that
mattered
his
attitude
to
his
whole
family
now
was
independent
indeed
he
was
in
reality
now
beginning
to
live
his
independent
life
he
was
perhaps
very
young
to
be
sent
off
to
school
by
himself
although
in
those
days
for
a
boy
of
eight
to
be
plunged
without
any
help
but
a
friendly
word
of
warning
into
the
stormy
seas
of
private
school
life
was
common
enough
nevertheless
his
father
conscious
that
the
life
had
been
hitherto
spent
almost
entirely
among
women
sent
him
every
morning
during
these
last
weeks
at
home
down
to
the
curate
of
to
learn
a
few
words
of
latin
an
easy
sum
or
two
and
the
rudiments
of
spelling
this
young
curate
the
rev
wilfred
somerset
recently
of
emmanuel
college
cambridge
had
but
two
ideas
in
his
head
the
noble
game
of
cricket
and
the
jolly
qualities
of
surtees
novels
he
was
stout
and
strong
and
thick
in
the
leg
always
smoking
a
largo
pipe
and
wearing
trousers
very
short
and
tight
he
did
not
strike
jeremy
with
fear
but
he
was
nevertheless
an
influence
jeremy
apparently
amused
him
intensely
he
would
roar
with
laughter
at
nothing
at
all
smack
his
thigh
and
shout
good
for
you
young
whatever
that
might
mean
and
jeremy
gazing
at
him
at
his
pipe
and
his
trousers
liking
him
rather
but
not
sufficiently
in
awe
to
be
really
impressed
would
ask
him
questions
that
seemed
to
him
perfectly
simple
and
natural
but
that
nevertheless
amused
the
rev
wilfred
so
fundamentally
that
he
was
unable
to
give
them
an
intelligible
answer
undoubtedly
this
encouraged
jeremy
independence
he
walked
to
and
fro
the
curate
lodging
by
himself
and
was
able
to
observe
many
interesting
things
on
the
way
sometimes
late
in
the
afternoon
he
would
have
some
lesson
that
he
must
take
to
his
master
who
as
he
lodged
at
the
bottom
of
orange
street
was
a
very
safe
and
steady
distance
from
the
coles
of
course
aunt
amy
objected
you
allow
jeremy
all
by
himself
into
the
street
at
night
and
only
eight
really
you
too
strange
well
in
the
first
place
said
cole
mildly
it
night
it
afternoon
in
the
second
place
it
is
only
just
down
the
street
and
jeremy
most
obedient
always
as
you
know
i
sure
that
somerset
is
wild
said
aunt
amy
my
dear
amy
why
you
only
got
to
look
at
his
face
it
that
what
i
call
oh
that
is
the
sort
of
man
who
do
jeremy
harm
said
cole
with
a
mother
wisdom
certainly
he
did
jeremy
no
harm
at
all
he
taught
him
nothing
not
even
mensa
and
how
to
spell
receive
and
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
encourage
jeremy
independence
and
this
was
done
in
the
first
place
by
the
walks
to
and
fro
he
had
only
been
going
to
somerset
a
day
or
two
when
the
announcements
of
the
fair
appeared
on
the
walls
of
the
town
he
could
not
help
but
see
them
there
was
a
large
cue
on
the
boarding
down
orange
street
just
opposite
the
doctor
a
poster
with
a
coloured
picture
of
wombwell
circus
a
fine
affair
with
spangled
ladies
jumping
through
hoops
elephants
sitting
on
stools
tigers
prowling
a
clown
cracking
a
whip
and
best
of
all
a
gentleman
with
an
anxious
face
and
a
scanty
but
elegant
costume
balanced
above
a
gazing
multitude
on
a
there
was
also
a
bill
of
the
fair
setting
forth
that
there
would
be
a
cattle
market
races
roundabout
swings
wrestling
boxing
fat
women
dwarfs
and
the
giant
from
the
during
a
whole
week
once
a
day
jeremy
read
this
bill
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
could
repeat
it
all
by
heart
he
asked
somerset
whether
he
was
going
oh
i
shall
slip
along
one
evening
i
no
doubt
replied
that
gentleman
but
it
a
bore
a
whole
week
of
it
upsets
one
it
need
said
jeremy
if
you
stay
this
amused
somerset
immensely
he
laughed
a
great
deal
we
always
have
to
said
jeremy
rather
hurt
we
not
allowed
farther
than
the
ah
but
i
older
than
you
are
said
somerset
it
was
the
same
with
me
and
what
did
you
do
did
you
go
all
the
same
you
bet
i
did
said
the
hero
more
intent
on
his
reminiscences
than
on
the
effect
that
this
might
have
on
the
morals
of
his
pupil
jeremy
waited
then
for
the
parental
command
that
was
always
issued
it
was
now
children
you
must
promise
me
never
to
go
outside
the
house
this
week
unless
you
have
asked
permission
and
then
and
on
no
account
to
speak
to
any
stranger
about
anything
and
then
do
look
out
of
the
back
windows
from
the
extreme
corners
of
the
bedroom
windows
you
could
see
a
patch
of
the
meadow
whereon
the
settled
these
commands
had
been
as
regular
as
the
fair
and
always
of
course
the
children
had
promised
obedience
jeremy
told
his
conscience
that
if
this
year
he
gave
his
promise
he
would
certainly
keep
it
he
wondered
at
the
same
time
whether
he
might
not
possibly
manage
to
be
out
of
the
house
when
the
commands
were
issued
he
formed
a
habit
of
suddenly
slipping
out
of
the
room
when
he
saw
his
mouth
assuming
the
shape
of
a
he
took
the
utmost
care
not
to
be
alone
with
his
father
but
he
need
not
have
been
alarmed
this
year
no
command
appeared
perhaps
cole
thought
that
it
was
no
longer
necessary
it
was
obvious
that
the
children
were
not
to
go
and
they
were
after
all
old
enough
now
to
think
for
themselves
or
perhaps
it
was
that
cole
had
other
things
on
his
mind
he
was
changing
curates
just
then
and
a
succession
of
and
young
men
were
appearing
at
the
coles
hospitable
table
here
this
tiresome
fair
come
round
again
said
cole
wicked
said
aunt
amy
with
an
envious
shudder
satan
finds
work
indeed
in
this
i
do
suppose
it
worse
than
anywhere
else
said
cole
on
the
late
afternoon
of
the
day
before
the
opening
jeremy
on
his
way
to
somerset
caught
the
tailend
of
wombwell
circus
procession
moving
in
misty
splendour
across
the
market
he
could
see
but
little
although
he
stood
on
the
pedestal
of
a
but
britannia
rocking
high
in
the
air
flashing
her
silver
sceptre
in
the
evening
air
and
followed
by
two
enormous
and
melancholy
elephants
caught
his
gaze
strains
of
a
band
lingered
about
him
he
entered
somerset
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
but
he
said
nothing
he
felt
that
somerset
would
laugh
at
him
he
returned
to
his
home
that
night
haunted
by
britannia
he
ate
britannia
for
his
supper
he
had
britannia
for
his
dreams
and
he
greeted
rose
as
britannia
the
next
morning
when
she
called
him
early
upon
that
day
there
were
borne
into
the
heart
of
the
house
strains
of
the
fair
it
was
no
use
whatever
to
close
the
windows
lock
the
doors
and
read
divinity
the
strains
persisted
a
heavenly
murmur
rising
at
moments
into
a
muffled
shriek
or
a
jumbling
shout
hanging
about
the
walls
as
a
romantic
echo
dying
upon
the
air
a
chastened
wail
no
use
for
cole
to
say
we
must
behave
as
though
the
fair
was
for
a
whole
week
it
would
be
there
and
everyone
knew
it
jeremy
did
not
mean
to
be
disobedient
but
after
that
glimpse
of
britannia
he
knew
that
he
would
go
iii
it
had
at
first
been
thought
advisable
that
jeremy
should
not
go
to
somerset
during
fair
week
perhaps
somerset
could
come
to
the
coles
no
he
was
very
sorry
he
must
be
in
his
rooms
at
that
particular
hour
in
case
parishioners
should
need
his
advice
or
assistance
pity
for
him
to
miss
all
this
week
especially
as
there
will
be
only
four
days
left
after
that
i
am
really
anxious
for
him
to
have
a
little
grounding
in
cole
smiled
confidently
i
think
jeremy
is
to
be
trusted
he
would
never
do
anything
that
you
would
cole
was
not
so
sure
he
not
quite
so
obedient
as
i
should
wish
he
shows
an
independence
however
after
some
hesitation
it
was
decided
that
jeremy
might
be
trusted
but
even
after
that
he
was
never
put
upon
his
honour
if
i
promise
i
need
mind
he
said
to
himself
and
waited
breathlessly
but
nothing
came
only
aunt
amy
said
i
hope
you
do
speak
to
little
boys
in
the
street
to
which
he
replied
scornfully
of
course
he
investigated
his
removing
the
top
with
a
he
found
that
he
had
there
a
large
sum
and
enough
to
give
him
a
royal
time
mary
caught
him
oh
jeremy
what
are
you
doing
just
counting
my
money
he
said
with
carelessness
you
going
to
the
fair
she
whispered
breathlessly
he
frowned
how
could
she
know
she
always
knew
everything
perhaps
he
whispered
back
but
if
you
tell
anyone
i
of
course
i
would
tell
she
replied
deeply
offended
this
little
conversation
strengthened
his
purpose
he
had
not
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
really
going
now
he
knew
wednesday
would
be
the
night
on
wednesday
evenings
his
father
had
a
service
which
prevented
him
from
returning
home
until
eight
he
would
go
to
somerset
at
four
and
would
be
expected
home
at
six
there
would
be
no
real
alarm
about
him
until
his
father
return
from
church
and
he
could
therefore
be
sure
of
two
hours
bliss
for
the
consequences
he
did
not
care
at
all
he
was
going
to
do
no
harm
to
anyone
or
anything
they
would
be
angry
perhaps
but
that
would
not
hurt
him
and
in
any
case
he
was
going
to
school
next
week
no
one
at
school
would
mind
whether
he
had
been
to
the
fair
or
no
he
felt
aloof
and
apart
as
though
no
one
could
touch
him
he
would
not
have
minded
simply
going
into
them
all
and
saying
i
off
to
the
the
obvious
drawback
to
that
would
have
been
that
he
would
have
been
shut
up
in
his
room
and
then
they
might
make
him
give
his
word
he
would
not
break
any
promises
when
wednesday
came
it
was
a
lovely
day
out
in
the
field
just
behind
the
coles
house
they
were
burning
a
huge
bonfire
of
dead
leaves
at
first
only
a
heavy
column
of
grey
smoke
rose
then
flames
broke
through
little
thin
golden
flames
like
paper
then
a
sudden
fierce
red
tongue
shot
out
and
went
licking
up
into
the
air
until
it
faded
like
tumbling
water
against
the
sunlight
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
bonfire
there
was
thin
grey
smoke
through
which
you
could
see
as
through
glass
the
smell
was
heavenly
and
even
through
closed
windows
the
crackling
of
the
burnt
leaves
could
be
heard
the
sight
of
the
bonfire
excited
jeremy
it
seemed
to
him
a
signal
of
encouragement
a
spur
to
perseverance
all
the
morning
the
flames
crackled
and
men
came
with
wheelbarrows
full
of
leaves
and
emptied
them
in
thick
heaps
upon
the
fire
at
each
emptying
the
fire
would
be
for
a
moment
beaten
and
only
the
white
thick
malicious
smoke
would
come
through
then
a
little
spit
of
flame
another
another
then
a
thrust
like
a
golden
hand
stretching
out
then
a
fine
towering
quivering
splendour
under
the
full
noonday
sun
the
fire
was
pale
and
so
unreal
weak
and
sickly
that
one
was
almost
ashamed
to
look
at
it
but
as
the
afternoon
passed
it
again
gathered
strength
and
with
the
faint
dusky
evening
it
was
a
giant
once
more
you
come
along
it
said
to
jeremy
come
along
come
along
i
going
to
somerset
mother
he
said
putting
two
exercise
books
and
a
very
new
and
shining
blue
latin
book
together
are
you
dear
i
suppose
you
safe
cole
asked
looking
through
the
window
oh
it
all
right
said
jeremy
well
i
think
it
is
said
cole
the
street
seems
quite
empty
do
speak
to
any
men
will
you
oh
that
all
right
he
said
again
he
walked
down
orange
street
his
books
under
his
arm
the
in
his
pocket
the
street
was
quite
deserted
swimming
in
a
cold
pale
light
the
trees
the
houses
the
church
the
sharp
and
black
the
street
dim
and
precipitous
tumbling
forward
into
the
blue
whence
lights
one
two
three
now
a
little
bunch
together
came
pricking
out
the
old
woman
opened
the
door
when
he
rang
somerset
bell
master
been
called
away
she
said
in
her
croaking
voice
a
burial
time
to
let
you
know
the
little
said
sorry
all
right
said
jeremy
thank
he
descended
the
steps
then
stood
where
he
was
in
the
street
looking
up
and
down
who
could
deny
that
it
was
all
being
arranged
for
him
he
felt
more
than
ever
like
god
as
he
looked
proudly
about
him
everything
served
his
purpose
the
jingling
of
the
money
in
his
pocket
reminded
him
that
he
must
waste
no
more
time
he
started
off
even
his
progress
through
the
town
seemed
wonderful
quite
unattended
at
last
as
he
had
always
all
his
life
longed
to
be
so
soon
as
he
left
orange
street
and
entered
the
market
he
was
caught
into
a
great
crowd
it
was
all
stirring
and
humming
with
a
noise
such
as
the
bonfire
had
all
day
been
making
it
was
his
first
introduction
to
the
world
he
had
never
been
in
a
large
crowd
before
and
it
is
not
to
be
denied
but
that
his
heart
beat
thick
and
his
knees
trembled
a
little
but
he
pulled
himself
together
who
was
he
to
be
afraid
but
the
books
under
his
arm
were
a
nuisance
he
suddenly
dropped
them
in
amongst
the
legs
and
boots
of
the
people
there
were
many
interesting
sights
to
be
seen
in
the
but
he
could
not
stay
and
he
found
himself
soon
to
his
own
surprise
slipping
through
the
people
as
quietly
and
easily
as
though
he
had
done
it
all
his
days
only
always
he
kept
his
hand
on
his
money
lest
that
should
be
stolen
and
his
adventure
suddenly
come
to
nothing
he
knew
his
way
very
well
and
soon
he
was
at
the
end
of
finch
street
which
in
those
days
opened
straight
into
fields
and
hedges
even
now
so
little
has
polchester
grown
in
thirty
years
the
fields
and
hedges
are
not
very
far
away
here
there
was
a
stile
with
a
large
wooden
fence
on
either
side
of
it
and
a
man
saying
pay
your
sixpences
now
come
along
pay
your
sixpences
crowds
of
people
were
passing
through
the
stile
jostling
one
another
pressing
and
pushing
but
all
apparently
in
good
temper
for
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
merriment
from
the
other
side
of
the
fence
came
a
torrent
of
sound
so
discordant
and
so
tumultuous
that
it
was
impossible
to
separate
the
elements
of
it
one
from
another
screams
shrieks
the
bellowing
of
animals
and
the
monotonous
rise
and
fall
of
scraps
of
tune
several
bars
of
one
and
then
bars
of
another
and
then
everything
lost
together
in
the
general
babel
and
to
the
right
of
him
jeremy
could
see
not
very
far
away
quiet
fields
with
cows
grazing
and
the
dark
grave
wood
on
the
horizon
would
he
venture
for
a
moment
his
heart
failed
him
a
wave
of
something
threatening
and
terribly
powerful
seemed
to
come
out
to
him
through
the
stile
and
the
people
who
were
passing
in
looked
large
and
fierce
then
he
saw
two
small
boys
their
whole
bearing
one
of
audacious
boldness
push
through
he
was
not
going
to
be
beaten
he
followed
a
man
with
a
back
like
a
wall
one
please
he
said
along
now
pay
your
sixpences
pay
your
sixpences
cried
the
man
he
was
through
he
stepped
at
once
into
something
that
had
for
him
all
the
elements
of
the
most
terrifying
and
enchanting
of
fairy
tales
he
was
planted
it
seemed
in
a
giant
world
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
high
and
thick
bodies
of
the
people
who
moved
on
every
side
of
him
he
peered
under
shoulders
he
was
lost
amongst
legs
and
arms
he
walked
suddenly
into
waistcoat
buttons
and
was
flung
thence
on
to
walking
sticks
but
it
was
if
he
had
known
it
the
most
magical
hour
of
all
for
him
to
have
chosen
it
was
the
moment
when
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
woods
and
hills
leaves
a
faint
white
crystal
sky
and
a
world
transformed
in
an
instant
from
sharp
outlines
and
material
form
into
coloured
mist
and
rising
vapour
the
fair
also
was
transformed
putting
forward
all
its
lights
and
becoming
after
the
glaring
tawdiness
of
the
day
a
place
of
shadow
and
sudden
circles
of
flame
and
dim
obscurity
lights
even
as
jeremy
watched
sprang
into
the
air
wavered
faltered
hesitated
then
rocked
into
a
steady
glow
only
shifting
a
little
with
the
haze
on
either
side
of
him
were
rough
wooden
stalls
and
these
were
illuminated
with
gas
which
sizzled
and
hissed
like
angry
snakes
the
stalls
were
covered
with
everything
invented
by
man
here
a
sweet
stall
with
thick
sticky
lumps
of
white
and
green
and
red
glass
bottles
of
bulls
eyes
and
peppermints
thick
slabs
of
almond
toffee
and
pink
cocoanut
icing
boxes
of
round
chocolate
creams
and
sticks
of
liquorice
lumps
of
gingerbread
with
coloured
pictures
stuck
upon
them
saffron
buns
plum
cakes
in
glass
jars
and
chains
of
little
sugary
biscuits
hanging
on
long
red
strings
there
was
the
stall
with
trousers
and
coats
and
waistcoats
all
shabby
and
lanky
swinging
beneath
the
gas
and
piles
of
clothes
on
the
boards
all
nondescript
and
unhappy
and
faded
there
was
the
stall
with
the
farm
implements
and
the
medicine
stall
and
the
flower
stall
and
the
vegetable
stall
and
many
many
another
each
place
had
his
or
her
guardian
vociferous
screaming
out
the
wares
lowering
the
voice
to
cajole
raising
it
again
to
draw
back
a
retreating
customer
carrying
on
suddenly
an
intimate
conversation
with
the
shopkeeper
laughing
quarrelling
arguing
to
jeremy
it
was
a
world
of
giant
heights
and
depths
behind
the
stalls
beyond
the
lane
down
which
he
moved
was
an
uncertain
glory
a
threatening
peril
he
fancied
that
strange
animals
moved
there
he
thought
he
heard
a
lion
roar
and
an
elephant
bellow
the
din
of
the
sellers
all
about
him
made
it
impossible
to
tell
what
was
happening
beyond
there
only
the
lights
and
bells
shouts
and
cries
confusing
smells
and
a
great
roar
of
distant
voices
he
almost
wished
that
he
had
not
come
he
felt
so
very
small
and
helpless
he
wondered
whether
he
could
find
his
way
out
again
and
looking
back
he
was
for
a
moment
terrified
to
see
that
the
stream
of
people
behind
him
shut
him
in
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
stile
nor
the
wooden
barrier
nor
the
man
pushed
forward
he
found
himself
at
the
end
of
the
lane
and
standing
in
a
space
surrounded
by
booths
with
painted
pictures
upon
them
and
in
front
of
them
platforms
with
wooden
steps
running
up
to
them
then
so
unexpectedly
that
he
gave
a
little
scream
a
sudden
roar
burst
out
behind
him
he
turned
and
indeed
the
world
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
a
moment
ago
there
had
been
darkness
and
dim
shadow
now
suddenly
there
was
a
huge
whistling
tossing
circle
of
light
and
flame
and
from
the
centre
of
this
a
banging
brazen
scream
scream
that
through
its
strident
shrillness
he
recognised
as
a
tune
that
he
knew
a
tune
often
whistled
by
jim
at
cow
farm
and
her
golden
hair
was
hanging
down
her
whence
the
tune
came
he
could
not
tell
from
the
very
belly
of
the
flaming
monster
it
seemed
but
as
he
watched
he
saw
that
the
huge
circle
whirled
ever
faster
and
faster
and
that
up
and
down
on
the
flame
of
it
coloured
horses
rose
and
fell
vanishing
from
light
to
darkness
from
darkness
to
light
and
seeming
of
their
own
free
will
and
motion
to
dance
to
the
thundering
music
it
was
the
most
terrific
thing
that
he
had
ever
seen
the
most
terrific
thing
he
stood
there
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
legs
apart
his
mouth
open
forgetting
utterly
the
crowd
thinking
nothing
of
time
or
danger
or
punishment
he
gazed
with
his
whole
body
as
his
eyes
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
glare
of
the
hissing
gas
he
saw
that
in
the
centre
figures
were
painted
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
pillar
that
revolved
without
pause
there
was
a
woman
with
flaming
red
cheeks
a
gold
dress
and
dead
white
dusty
arms
a
man
with
a
golden
crown
and
a
purple
robe
but
a
broken
nose
and
a
minstrel
with
a
harp
the
woman
and
the
king
moved
stiffly
their
arms
up
and
down
that
they
might
strike
instruments
one
a
cymbal
and
the
other
a
drum
but
it
was
finally
the
horses
that
caught
jeremy
heart
half
of
them
at
least
were
without
riders
and
the
empty
ones
went
round
pathetically
envying
the
more
successful
ones
and
dancing
to
the
music
as
though
with
an
effort
one
especially
moved
jeremy
sympathy
he
was
a
fine
horse
rather
fresher
than
the
others
with
a
mane
and
great
black
bulging
eyes
his
saddle
was
of
gold
and
his
trappings
of
red
as
he
went
round
he
seemed
to
catch
jeremy
eye
and
to
beg
him
to
come
to
him
he
rode
more
securely
than
the
rest
rising
nobly
like
a
horse
of
fine
breeding
falling
again
with
an
implication
of
restrained
force
as
though
he
would
say
i
have
only
to
let
myself
go
and
there
my
word
you
would
see
where
i
get
his
bold
black
eyes
turned
beseechingly
to
jeremy
surely
it
was
not
only
a
trick
of
the
waving
gas
the
boy
drew
closer
and
closer
never
moving
his
gaze
from
the
horses
who
had
hitherto
been
whirling
at
a
bacchanalian
pace
but
now
as
at
some
sudden
secret
command
suddenly
slackened
hesitated
fell
into
a
gentle
then
scarcely
rose
scarcely
fell
were
suddenly
still
jeremy
saw
what
it
was
that
you
did
if
you
wanted
to
ride
a
stout
dirty
man
came
out
amongst
the
horses
and
resting
his
hands
on
their
backs
as
though
they
were
less
than
nothing
to
him
shouted
now
your
chance
lidies
and
gents
now
lidies
and
gents
come
along
hup
come
along
hup
the
ride
of
your
life
now
a
a
time
a
a
time
and
the
finest
ride
of
your
life
people
began
to
mount
the
steps
that
led
on
to
the
platform
where
the
horses
stood
a
woman
then
a
man
and
a
boy
then
two
men
then
two
girls
giggling
together
then
a
man
and
a
girl
and
the
stout
fellow
shouted
come
along
hup
come
along
hup
now
lidies
and
gents
a
a
ride
come
along
hup
jeremy
noticed
then
that
the
fine
horse
with
the
black
mane
had
stopped
close
beside
him
impossible
to
say
whether
the
horse
had
intended
it
or
no
he
was
staring
now
in
front
of
him
with
the
innocent
stupid
gaze
that
animals
can
assume
when
they
do
not
wish
to
give
themselves
away
but
jeremy
could
see
that
he
was
taking
it
for
granted
that
jeremy
understood
the
affair
if
you
such
a
fool
as
not
to
understand
he
seemed
to
say
well
then
i
do
want
jeremy
gazed
and
the
reproach
in
those
eyes
was
more
than
he
could
endure
and
at
any
moment
someone
else
might
settle
himself
on
that
beautiful
back
there
that
stupid
fat
giggling
girl
no
she
had
moved
elsewhere
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
with
a
thumping
heart
clutching
a
scalding
penny
in
a
hand
he
mounted
the
steps
one
ride
little
you
are
on
now
oh
you
wants
that
one
do
yer
eight
yer
are
yer
pays
yer
money
and
yer
takes
yer
he
lifted
jeremy
up
put
yer
arms
round
neck
now
wo
bite
yer
bite
him
indeed
jeremy
felt
as
he
clutched
the
cool
head
and
let
his
hand
slide
over
the
stiff
black
mane
that
he
knew
more
about
that
horse
than
his
owner
did
he
seemed
to
feel
beneath
him
the
horse
response
to
his
clutching
knees
the
head
seemed
to
rise
for
a
moment
and
nod
to
him
and
the
eyes
to
say
it
all
right
i
look
after
you
i
give
you
the
best
ride
of
your
life
he
felt
indeed
that
the
gaze
of
the
whole
world
was
upon
him
but
he
responded
to
it
proudly
staring
boldly
around
him
as
though
he
had
been
seated
on
all
his
days
perhaps
some
in
the
gaping
crowd
knew
him
and
were
saying
why
there
the
rev
cole
kid
never
mind
he
was
above
scandal
from
where
he
was
he
could
see
the
fair
lifted
up
and
translated
into
a
fantastic
splendour
nothing
was
certain
nothing
defined
above
him
a
canopy
of
evening
sky
with
circles
and
chains
of
stars
mixed
with
the
rosy
haze
of
the
flame
of
the
fair
opposite
him
was
the
palace
of
the
giant
from
the
caucasus
a
huge
man
as
portrayed
in
the
picture
hanging
on
his
outer
walls
a
giant
naked
save
for
a
bearskin
with
one
head
black
and
one
yellow
and
white
protruding
teeth
in
both
mouths
next
to
him
was
the
fortune
teller
and
outside
this
a
little
man
with
a
hump
beat
a
drum
then
there
was
the
theatre
of
tragedy
and
mirth
with
a
poster
on
one
side
of
the
door
portraying
a
lady
drowning
in
the
swiftest
of
rivers
but
with
the
prospect
of
being
saved
by
a
stout
gentleman
who
leaned
over
from
the
bank
and
grasped
her
hair
then
there
was
the
chamber
of
the
fat
lady
and
the
six
little
dwarfs
and
the
entry
to
this
was
guarded
by
a
dirty
female
who
gnashed
her
teeth
at
a
hesitating
public
before
whom
with
a
splendid
indifference
to
appearance
she
consumed
out
of
a
piece
of
newspaper
her
evening
meal
all
these
things
were
in
jeremy
immediate
vision
and
beyond
them
was
a
haze
that
his
eyes
could
not
penetrate
it
held
he
knew
wild
beasts
because
he
could
hear
quite
clearly
from
time
to
time
the
lion
and
the
elephant
and
the
tiger
it
held
music
because
from
somewhere
through
all
the
noise
and
confusion
the
tune
of
a
band
penetrated
it
held
buyers
and
sellers
and
treasures
and
riches
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
surely
all
the
world
must
be
here
and
then
beyond
the
haze
there
were
the
silent
and
mysterious
gipsy
caravans
dark
with
their
little
square
windows
and
their
coloured
walls
and
their
round
wheels
and
the
smell
of
wood
fires
and
the
noise
of
hissing
kettles
and
horses
cropping
the
grass
and
around
them
the
still
night
world
with
the
thick
woods
and
the
dark
river
he
did
not
see
it
all
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
he
was
as
yet
too
young
but
he
did
feel
the
contrast
between
the
din
and
glare
around
him
and
the
silence
and
dark
beyond
and
afterwards
looking
back
he
knew
that
he
had
found
in
that
same
contrast
the
very
heart
of
romance
as
it
was
he
simply
clutched
his
horse
beautiful
head
and
waited
for
the
ride
to
begin
they
were
off
he
felt
his
horse
quiver
under
him
he
saw
the
mansions
of
the
giant
and
the
fat
lady
slip
to
the
right
the
light
seemed
to
swing
like
the
skirt
of
someone
dress
upwards
across
the
floor
and
from
the
heart
of
the
golden
woman
and
the
king
and
the
minstrel
a
scream
burst
forth
as
though
they
were
announcing
the
end
of
the
world
after
that
he
had
no
clear
idea
as
to
what
occurred
he
was
swung
into
space
and
all
the
life
that
had
been
so
stationary
the
booths
the
lights
the
men
and
women
the
very
stars
went
swinging
with
him
as
though
to
cheer
him
on
the
horse
under
him
galloped
before
and
the
faster
he
galloped
the
wilder
was
the
music
and
the
dizzier
the
world
he
was
exultant
omnipotent
supreme
he
had
long
known
that
this
glory
was
somewhere
if
it
could
only
be
found
all
his
days
he
seemed
to
have
been
searching
for
it
he
beat
his
horse
neck
he
drove
his
legs
against
his
sides
go
on
go
on
go
on
he
cried
faster
faster
faster
the
strangest
things
seemed
to
rise
to
his
notice
and
then
fall
again
a
peaked
policeman
hat
flowers
a
sudden
flame
of
gas
the
staring
eyes
and
dead
white
arms
of
the
golden
woman
the
flying
forms
of
the
horses
in
front
of
him
all
the
world
was
on
horseback
all
the
world
was
racing
higher
and
higher
faster
and
faster
he
saw
someone
near
him
rise
on
to
his
horse
back
and
stand
on
it
waving
his
arms
he
would
like
to
have
done
that
but
he
found
that
he
was
part
of
his
horse
as
though
he
had
been
glued
to
it
he
shouted
he
cried
aloud
he
was
so
happy
that
he
thought
of
no
one
and
nothing
the
flame
danced
about
him
in
a
circle
he
seemed
to
rise
so
high
that
there
was
a
sudden
stillness
he
was
in
the
very
heart
of
the
stars
then
came
the
supreme
moment
when
as
he
had
always
known
that
one
day
he
would
be
he
was
master
of
the
world
then
like
lucifer
he
fell
slowly
the
stars
receded
the
music
slackened
people
rocked
on
to
their
feet
again
the
giant
slipped
hack
once
more
into
his
place
he
saw
the
sinister
lady
still
devouring
her
supper
women
looking
up
at
him
gaped
his
horse
gave
a
last
little
leap
and
died
this
marvellous
experience
he
repeated
four
times
and
every
time
with
an
ecstasy
more
complete
than
the
last
he
rushed
to
a
height
he
fell
he
rushed
again
he
fell
and
at
every
return
to
a
sober
life
his
one
intention
was
instantly
to
be
off
on
his
steed
once
more
he
was
about
to
start
on
his
fifth
journey
he
had
paid
his
halfpenny
he
was
sitting
forward
with
his
hands
on
the
black
mane
his
eyes
staring
were
filled
already
with
the
glory
that
he
knew
was
coming
to
him
his
cheeks
were
crimson
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
hair
flying
he
heard
a
voice
quiet
and
cool
a
little
below
him
but
very
near
jeremy
jeremy
come
off
that
you
got
to
go
he
looked
down
and
saw
his
uncle
samuel
iv
it
was
all
over
he
knew
at
once
that
it
was
all
over
as
he
slipped
down
from
his
dear
horse
he
gave
the
glossy
dark
mane
one
last
pat
then
with
a
little
sigh
he
found
his
feet
stumbled
over
the
wooden
steps
and
was
at
his
uncle
side
uncle
samuel
looked
queer
enough
with
a
squashy
black
hat
a
black
cloak
flung
over
his
shoulders
and
a
large
pipe
in
his
mouth
jeremy
looked
up
at
him
defiantly
well
said
uncle
samuel
sarcastically
it
nothing
to
you
i
suppose
that
the
is
at
this
moment
ringing
his
bell
for
you
up
and
down
the
market
place
does
father
know
jeremy
asked
quickly
he
does
answered
uncle
samuel
jeremy
cast
one
last
look
around
the
place
the
was
engaged
once
more
upon
its
wild
course
the
horses
rising
and
falling
the
golden
woman
clashing
the
cymbals
the
minstrel
striking
with
his
dead
eyes
fixed
upon
space
his
harp
all
about
men
were
shouting
the
noise
of
the
coconut
stores
of
the
circus
of
the
band
of
the
hucksters
and
the
charlatans
the
crying
of
children
the
laughter
of
women
all
the
noise
of
the
fair
bathed
jeremy
up
to
his
forehead
he
swam
in
it
for
the
last
time
he
tried
to
catch
one
last
glimpse
of
his
charger
then
with
a
sigh
he
said
turning
to
his
uncle
i
suppose
we
better
be
yes
i
suppose
we
had
said
uncle
samuel
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
fair
passed
the
wooden
stile
and
were
once
again
in
the
streets
dark
and
ancient
under
the
moon
with
all
the
noise
and
glare
behind
them
jeremy
was
thinking
to
himself
it
does
matter
what
father
does
or
how
angry
he
is
that
was
worth
it
was
strange
how
little
afraid
he
was
only
a
year
ago
to
be
punished
by
his
father
had
been
a
terrible
thing
now
since
his
mother
illness
in
the
summer
his
father
had
seemed
to
have
no
influence
over
him
did
they
bend
you
or
did
you
just
come
yourself
uncle
asked
jeremy
i
happened
to
be
taking
the
air
in
that
direction
said
uncle
samuel
i
hope
you
did
come
away
before
you
wanted
to
said
jeremy
politely
i
did
not
said
his
uncle
is
father
very
angry
asked
jeremy
it
more
than
likely
he
may
be
the
town
crier
i
did
think
they
know
explained
jeremy
i
meant
to
get
back
in
your
father
did
go
to
church
said
uncle
samuel
so
your
sins
were
quickly
jeremy
said
nothing
just
as
they
were
climbing
orange
street
he
said
uncle
samuel
i
think
i
be
a
oh
will
you
well
before
you
train
horses
you
got
to
train
yourself
think
of
others
beside
yourself
a
fine
state
you
put
your
mother
into
jeremy
looked
distressed
she
know
if
i
was
dead
someone
would
come
and
tell
her
he
said
but
i
tell
mother
i
sorry
but
i
tell
father
he
added
why
not
asked
uncle
samuel
because
he
make
such
a
fuss
and
i
not
sorry
he
never
told
me
not
no
but
you
knew
you
had
i
very
good
at
obeying
explained
jeremy
if
someone
says
something
but
if
someone
does
there
is
anyone
to
uncle
samuel
shook
his
head
you
be
a
bit
of
a
prig
my
son
if
you
are
careful
he
said
i
think
it
will
be
splendid
to
be
a
said
jeremy
it
was
a
lovely
horse
and
i
only
spent
a
shilling
i
had
three
and
threepence
at
the
door
of
their
house
uncle
samuel
stopped
and
said
look
here
young
man
they
say
it
time
you
went
to
school
and
i
do
think
they
far
wrong
there
are
things
wiser
heads
than
yours
can
understand
and
you
better
take
their
word
for
it
in
the
future
if
you
want
to
go
running
off
somewhere
you
better
content
yourself
with
my
studio
and
make
a
mess
oh
may
i
cried
jeremy
delighted
that
studio
had
been
always
a
forbidden
place
to
them
and
had
therefore
its
air
of
enchanting
mystery
wo
you
really
mind
my
coming
he
asked
i
shall
probably
hate
it
answered
his
uncle
but
there
nothing
i
would
do
for
the
the
boy
walked
to
his
father
study
and
knocked
on
the
door
he
did
have
then
at
the
sound
of
that
knock
a
moment
of
panic
the
house
was
so
silent
and
he
knew
so
well
what
would
follow
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
not
sorry
in
the
least
he
seemed
to
be
indifferent
and
superior
as
though
no
punishment
could
touch
him
come
in
said
his
father
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
scene
that
followed
was
grave
and
sad
and
yet
in
the
end
strangely
unimpressive
his
father
talked
too
much
as
he
talked
jeremy
thoughts
would
fly
back
to
the
horse
and
to
that
moment
when
he
had
seemed
to
fly
into
the
very
heart
of
the
stars
ah
jeremy
how
could
you
said
his
father
is
obedience
nothing
to
you
do
you
know
how
god
punishes
disobedience
think
what
a
terrible
thing
is
a
disobedient
man
then
on
a
lower
scale
i
really
do
know
what
to
do
with
you
you
knew
that
you
were
not
to
go
near
that
wicked
you
never
said
interrupted
jeremy
nonsense
you
knew
well
enough
you
will
break
your
mother
i
tell
her
i
sorry
he
interrupted
quickly
if
you
are
really
sorry
said
his
father
i
not
sorry
i
went
said
jeremy
but
i
sorry
i
hurt
the
end
of
it
was
that
jeremy
received
six
strokes
on
the
hand
with
a
ruler
cole
was
not
good
at
this
kind
of
thing
and
twice
he
missed
jeremy
hand
altogether
and
looked
very
foolish
it
was
not
an
edifying
scene
jeremy
left
the
room
his
head
high
his
spirit
obstinate
and
his
father
remained
puzzled
distressed
at
a
loss
anxious
to
do
what
was
right
but
unable
to
touch
his
son
at
all
jeremy
went
up
to
his
room
he
opened
his
window
and
looked
out
he
could
smell
the
burnt
leaves
of
the
bonfire
there
was
no
flame
now
but
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
a
white
shadow
where
it
had
been
then
on
the
wind
came
the
music
of
the
fair
tum
te
tum
tum
te
tum
whirr
whirr
whirr
bang
somewhere
an
owl
cried
and
then
another
owl
answered
he
rubbed
his
sore
hand
against
his
trousers
then
thinking
of
his
black
horse
he
smiled
he
was
a
free
man
in
a
week
he
would
go
to
school
then
he
would
go
to
college
then
he
would
be
a
horsetrainer
he
was
in
bed
faintly
into
the
dark
room
stole
the
scent
of
the
bonfire
and
the
noise
of
the
fair
tum
tum
te
tum
he
was
asleep
riding
on
a
giant
charger
across
boundless
plains
chapter
xii
hamlet
waits
i
the
last
day
jeremy
suddenly
waking
realised
this
with
a
confusion
of
feeling
as
though
he
were
sentenced
to
the
dentist
but
oddly
enough
looked
forward
to
his
visit
going
to
school
one
had
of
course
long
ago
perceived
was
a
mixed
business
but
the
balance
was
now
greatly
to
the
good
it
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
towards
liberty
and
freedom
thank
heaven
no
one
in
the
family
was
likely
to
make
a
fuss
about
his
departure
unless
it
were
possibly
mary
and
she
had
of
late
kept
very
much
to
herself
and
worried
him
scarcely
at
all
indeed
he
felt
guilty
about
mary
he
was
fond
of
her
really
funny
kid
if
only
she
did
make
fusses
yes
it
was
unlike
his
family
to
make
fusses
he
realised
that
very
plainly
everyone
went
about
his
or
her
daily
business
with
no
implication
whatever
that
something
extraordinary
was
going
to
happen
tomorrow
perhaps
they
were
all
secretly
relieved
that
he
was
off
he
had
been
he
knew
something
of
a
failure
during
these
last
months
one
trouble
after
another
the
scandal
of
his
visit
to
the
fair
as
the
grand
finale
he
felt
that
there
was
in
some
way
some
injustice
in
all
this
he
had
no
desire
to
be
bad
or
rebellious
on
the
contrary
he
wished
to
do
all
that
his
elders
ordered
him
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
rising
of
his
own
individuality
which
showed
him
quite
clearly
whether
he
should
do
a
thing
or
no
it
was
as
though
something
inside
him
pushed
him
whereas
they
all
of
them
only
checked
him
he
loved
his
mother
best
and
he
was
secretly
disappointed
to
find
how
ordinary
an
affair
his
departure
was
to
her
he
realised
with
a
perception
that
was
beyond
his
years
that
the
infant
barbara
was
now
rapidly
occupying
the
position
as
centre
of
the
family
that
he
had
held
barbara
everyone
declared
was
a
charming
baby
the
house
revolved
to
some
extent
round
barbara
but
then
again
this
isolation
was
entirely
his
own
fault
during
the
summer
holidays
he
had
gone
his
own
way
and
had
wanted
no
one
but
hamlet
as
his
companion
he
had
no
right
to
complain
after
breakfast
he
did
not
know
quite
what
to
do
and
it
was
obvious
also
that
no
one
knew
quite
what
to
do
with
him
cole
said
jeremy
dear
ponting
has
never
sent
that
letter
paper
and
envelopes
that
he
promised
and
father
must
have
them
would
you
go
down
and
bring
them
back
with
you
father
will
write
a
no
one
seemed
to
realise
what
an
abysmal
change
from
earlier
conditions
this
casual
sentence
marked
that
he
should
go
to
footing
which
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
town
alone
and
unattended
seemed
to
no
one
peculiar
and
yet
only
six
months
ago
a
walk
without
miss
jones
was
undreamt
of
and
before
her
no
more
than
nine
months
back
there
was
the
jampot
he
was
delighted
to
go
but
of
course
he
did
not
show
his
delight
all
he
said
was
yes
he
was
in
his
new
clothes
stiff
black
jacket
black
knickerbockers
black
stockings
black
boots
no
more
navy
suits
with
white
braid
and
whistles
perhaps
he
would
see
the
dean
ernest
it
was
his
most
urgent
desire
he
started
off
accompanied
by
a
barking
bounding
hamlet
who
showed
no
perception
of
the
calamity
that
threatened
to
tumble
upon
him
for
jeremy
leaving
hamlet
was
a
dreadful
affair
in
three
months
a
dog
can
change
more
swiftly
than
a
human
being
and
hamlet
although
not
a
supremely
greedy
dog
had
shown
of
late
increasing
signs
of
a
love
of
good
food
and
a
regrettable
tendency
to
fawn
upon
the
giver
of
the
same
even
when
it
was
aunt
amy
jeremy
had
checked
this
tendency
and
had
issued
punishments
when
necessary
and
hamlet
had
accepted
the
same
without
a
murmur
so
long
as
jeremy
was
there
hamlet
character
was
secure
but
now
during
this
long
absence
anything
might
happen
there
was
no
one
to
whom
jeremy
might
leave
him
no
one
who
had
the
slightest
idea
what
a
dog
should
do
and
what
he
should
not
these
melancholy
thoughts
filled
jeremy
mind
when
he
started
upon
his
walk
but
soon
he
was
absorbed
by
his
surroundings
he
realised
even
more
drastically
than
the
facts
warranted
that
he
was
making
his
farewell
to
the
town
he
was
not
making
his
final
farewell
he
would
not
make
that
until
his
death
and
perhaps
not
then
but
he
was
making
farewell
to
some
of
his
sense
of
his
wonder
in
it
only
not
thank
god
to
the
sense
of
wonder
itself
as
he
went
he
met
the
daily
figures
of
all
his
walks
and
he
could
not
help
but
speculate
on
their
realisation
of
the
great
change
that
was
coming
to
him
it
was
absurd
to
suppose
that
they
were
saying
to
themselves
ah
there
young
jeremy
cole
he
off
to
school
tomorrow
i
wonder
what
he
feels
about
it
no
that
was
incredible
and
yet
they
must
realise
something
of
the
adventure
he
on
his
part
stared
at
them
with
a
new
interest
they
had
before
shared
in
the
inevitable
background
without
individuality
but
now
that
he
was
leaving
them
and
they
would
grow
as
it
were
without
his
permission
he
was
forced
to
grant
them
independence
at
the
bottom
of
orange
street
he
met
dawson
the
cathedral
organist
he
was
a
little
plump
man
in
a
very
neat
grey
suit
a
shiny
top
hat
and
very
small
spats
he
was
always
dressed
in
the
same
fashion
and
carried
a
black
under
his
arm
he
had
an
eternal
interest
for
jeremy
because
whenever
he
was
mentioned
the
phrase
was
poor
little
dawson
why
he
was
to
be
pitied
jeremy
did
not
know
he
looked
spruce
and
bright
enough
and
generally
whistled
to
himself
as
he
walked
but
poor
was
an
exciting
adjective
and
jeremy
when
he
passed
him
felt
a
little
shudder
of
drama
run
down
his
spine
outside
poole
bookshop
there
was
of
course
mockridge
mockridge
was
the
poorest
of
the
canons
so
poor
that
it
had
become
a
proverb
in
the
place
as
poor
as
mockridge
and
also
another
proverb
i
am
afraid
from
the
same
source
as
dirty
as
he
was
a
very
long
thin
man
with
a
big
pointing
nose
coloured
red
not
from
indigestion
and
most
certainly
not
from
drink
but
simply
i
think
because
the
wind
caught
it
his
passion
was
for
books
and
he
might
be
seen
every
afternoon
between
three
and
four
bending
over
poole
box
a
dirty
handkerchief
flying
out
of
the
tail
of
his
long
black
coat
and
a
green
bulging
umbrella
pointing
outwards
under
his
arm
to
the
infinite
danger
of
all
the
he
was
so
commonplace
a
figure
to
jeremy
that
on
ordinary
days
he
was
shrouded
by
an
invisibility
of
tradition
but
he
was
fresh
and
strange
he
be
here
poking
his
nose
into
that
box
just
the
same
and
i
shall
be
then
on
the
outskirts
of
the
market
place
jeremy
paused
and
looked
about
him
there
was
all
the
usual
business
of
the
place
the
wooden
trestles
with
the
flowerpots
the
under
her
umbrella
the
empty
where
the
cows
and
sheep
stood
on
market
days
and
behind
them
the
dark
vaulted
arches
of
the
actual
market
now
empty
and
deserted
bathed
in
sunlight
it
lay
very
quiet
and
still
some
pigeons
pecking
at
grain
a
dog
or
two
and
children
playing
round
the
empty
from
the
hill
above
the
square
the
cathedral
boomed
the
hour
and
all
the
pigeons
rose
in
a
flight
hovered
then
slowly
settled
again
jeremy
sighed
and
with
a
strange
pain
at
his
heart
that
he
could
not
analyse
moved
up
the
hill
the
high
street
is
of
course
the
west
end
of
polchester
and
in
the
morning
between
ten
and
one
every
lady
in
the
town
may
be
seen
at
her
shopping
it
had
always
been
the
ambition
of
the
cole
children
to
be
taken
for
their
walk
up
high
street
in
the
morning
but
it
was
an
ambition
very
rarely
gratified
because
they
stopped
so
often
and
were
always
in
everyone
way
and
here
was
jeremy
at
this
gay
hour
a
trolling
up
the
high
street
all
by
himself
he
lifted
his
head
pushed
out
his
chest
and
looked
the
world
in
the
face
he
might
meet
the
dean
ernest
at
any
moment
the
first
people
whom
he
saw
were
the
misses
cragg
always
known
of
course
as
the
cragg
they
were
perhaps
polchester
most
constant
and
obvious
feature
there
were
four
of
them
all
as
yet
unmarried
all
with
faces
and
hard
straw
hats
short
skirts
and
tremendous
voices
forerunners
in
fact
of
a
type
now
almost
universal
they
played
croquet
and
were
prominent
members
of
the
archery
club
and
hunted
when
their
fathers
would
let
them
they
were
terrible
dianas
to
jeremy
he
had
met
one
of
them
once
at
a
children
dance
and
she
had
whirled
him
around
until
with
a
terrified
scream
he
broke
howling
from
her
arms
and
hid
himself
in
the
large
bosom
of
the
jampot
he
was
always
ashamed
of
this
memory
and
he
could
never
see
them
without
blushing
but
he
seemed
less
afraid
of
them
and
actually
when
he
passed
them
touched
his
hat
and
looked
them
in
the
face
they
all
smiled
and
nodded
to
him
and
when
they
had
gone
he
was
so
deeply
astonished
at
this
adventure
that
he
had
to
stop
and
consider
himself
if
the
craggs
were
nothing
to
him
what
might
he
not
face
come
here
hamlet
how
dare
you
he
ordered
in
so
sharp
and
military
a
voice
that
hamlet
who
had
merely
cast
a
most
innocent
glance
at
a
disdainful
and
conceited
white
poodle
looked
up
at
his
master
with
surprise
nevertheless
his
hardihood
received
in
the
very
midst
of
his
its
severest
test
he
stumbled
into
the
very
path
of
the
dean
wife
dean
could
never
have
seemed
to
anyone
a
large
woman
but
to
jeremy
she
had
always
been
a
terror
she
was
thick
and
hard
like
a
wall
and
wore
the
kind
of
silken
clothes
that
rustled
like
the
whispering
of
a
whole
meeting
of
frightened
clergymen
wives
as
she
moved
she
had
a
hard
condemnatory
voice
and
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
addressing
an
assembly
but
worst
of
all
she
had
black
beetling
eyebrows
and
these
frightened
jeremy
into
fits
he
did
not
of
course
know
that
the
poor
lady
suffered
continually
from
nervous
headaches
he
suddenly
heard
that
voice
in
his
ear
good
morning
jeremy
and
where
are
you
off
to
so
early
dean
was
never
so
awful
as
when
she
was
jolly
and
jeremy
caught
up
by
the
eyebrows
as
though
they
had
been
hooks
and
hung
thus
in
for
all
the
street
to
laugh
at
nearly
lost
his
command
of
his
natural
tongue
he
found
his
voice
just
in
time
to
ponting
he
said
all
alone
ah
no
i
see
you
have
your
little
dog
nice
little
dog
and
how
your
mother
she
quite
well
thank
that
right
that
right
we
have
seen
you
lately
you
must
come
up
to
tea
with
your
sisters
i
afraid
you
wo
find
ernest
he
gone
back
to
school
but
i
dare
say
you
not
too
big
to
play
with
little
jeremy
felt
some
triumph
at
his
heart
i
going
to
school
he
said
but
if
he
expected
dean
to
be
pitiful
at
this
statement
he
was
greatly
mistaken
are
you
indeed
such
a
pity
you
could
have
gone
with
ernest
but
he
be
senior
to
you
of
course
give
my
love
to
your
mother
and
she
pounded
her
way
along
she
a
beastly
woman
anyway
thought
jeremy
i
wish
i
found
something
to
say
to
her
i
wonder
whether
she
knows
i
knocked
ernest
down
in
the
summer
and
trod
on
him
but
the
sight
of
the
high
street
soon
restored
his
equanimity
on
other
occasions
he
had
been
pushed
through
it
either
by
the
jampot
or
miss
jones
so
rapidly
that
he
could
gather
only
the
most
fleeting
impressions
he
could
linger
and
linger
he
did
the
two
nicest
shops
were
mannings
the
hairdressers
and
ponting
the
but
rose
the
grocer
and
coulter
the
confectioner
were
very
good
manning
was
an
artist
he
did
not
simply
put
a
simpering
bust
with
an
elaborate
head
of
hair
in
his
window
and
leave
it
at
that
he
did
indeed
place
there
a
smiling
lady
with
a
wonderful
jewelled
comb
and
a
radiant
row
of
teeth
but
around
this
he
built
up
a
magnificent
world
of
silver
brushes
combs
essences
and
perfumes
and
powders
jars
and
bottles
and
boxes
manning
was
the
finest
artist
in
the
town
ponting
at
the
top
of
the
street
just
at
the
corner
of
the
close
was
an
artist
too
but
in
quite
another
fashion
ponting
was
the
best
established
most
sacred
and
serious
bookseller
in
the
county
in
the
days
when
the
new
waverley
was
the
sensation
of
the
moment
ponting
grandfather
of
the
present
ponting
had
been
in
quite
constant
correspondence
with
southey
and
coleridge
and
had
once
when
on
a
visit
to
london
spoken
to
the
great
lord
byron
himself
this
tradition
of
aristocracy
remained
and
the
present
pouting
always
advised
the
bishop
what
to
read
and
was
consulted
by
lamb
our
only
authoress
on
questions
of
publishers
and
editions
and
such
technical
points
for
all
this
jeremy
at
his
present
stage
of
interest
would
have
cared
nothing
even
had
he
known
it
but
what
he
did
care
for
were
the
rows
of
books
with
little
ridges
of
gold
that
made
a
fine
wall
across
the
window
with
an
old
print
of
the
cathedral
and
the
close
in
the
middle
of
them
inside
pontings
there
was
a
hush
as
of
the
study
and
the
church
combined
it
was
a
rather
dark
shop
with
rows
and
rows
of
books
disappearing
into
the
ceiling
and
one
grave
and
unnaturally
old
young
man
behind
the
counter
jeremy
did
not
know
what
he
should
do
about
hamlet
so
he
brought
him
inside
only
to
discover
to
his
horror
that
the
fiercest
of
all
the
canons
canon
waterbury
held
the
floor
of
the
shop
canon
waterbury
had
a
black
beard
and
a
biting
tongue
he
had
once
warned
jeremy
off
the
cathedral
grass
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
jeremy
had
never
forgotten
it
he
glared
now
and
pulled
his
beard
but
hamlet
fortunately
behaved
well
and
the
old
young
man
discovered
jeremy
notepaper
within
a
very
short
period
then
suddenly
the
canon
spoke
dogs
should
not
be
inside
shops
he
said
as
though
he
were
condemning
someone
to
death
i
know
said
jeremy
frankly
i
wanted
to
tie
him
up
to
something
and
there
was
nothing
to
tie
him
up
what
did
you
bring
him
out
for
at
all
said
the
canon
because
he
got
to
have
exercise
said
jeremy
discovering
to
his
own
delighted
surprise
that
he
was
not
frightened
in
the
least
oh
has
he
i
do
know
what
people
keep
dogs
and
then
he
stamped
out
of
the
shop
jeremy
regarded
this
in
the
light
of
a
victory
and
marched
away
his
head
more
in
the
air
than
ever
he
should
now
have
hurried
home
the
midday
chimes
had
rung
out
and
jeremy
duties
were
performed
but
he
lingered
listening
to
the
last
notes
of
the
chimes
hearing
the
cries
of
the
cathedral
as
they
moved
across
the
green
to
the
watching
all
the
people
hurry
up
and
down
the
street
ah
there
was
the
castle
carriage
perhaps
the
old
countess
was
inside
it
he
had
only
seen
her
once
at
some
service
in
the
cathedral
to
which
his
mother
had
taken
him
but
she
had
made
a
great
impression
on
him
with
her
hair
he
had
heard
people
speak
of
her
as
a
wicked
old
perhaps
she
was
inside
the
carriage
but
he
only
saw
the
castle
coachman
and
footman
and
the
coronet
on
the
door
it
rolled
slowly
up
the
hill
with
its
fine
air
of
commanding
the
whole
world
then
it
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
close
jeremy
decided
then
that
he
would
go
home
across
the
green
and
down
orchard
lane
he
had
a
wish
to
enter
the
cathedral
for
a
moment
such
a
visit
would
after
all
complete
the
round
of
his
experiences
he
had
never
entered
the
cathedral
alone
and
now
as
he
saw
it
facing
him
so
vast
and
majestic
and
quiet
across
the
green
he
felt
a
sudden
fear
and
awe
he
found
a
ring
in
a
stone
near
the
west
end
through
which
he
might
fasten
hamlet
lead
then
slowly
pushing
back
the
heavy
door
he
passed
inside
the
cathedral
was
utterly
quiet
the
vast
nave
stained
with
reflections
of
purple
and
green
and
ruby
was
vague
and
unsubstantial
all
the
little
wooden
chairs
huddled
together
to
the
right
and
left
leaving
a
great
path
that
swept
up
to
the
high
altar
under
shafts
of
light
that
fell
like
searchlights
from
the
windows
the
tombs
and
the
statues
peered
dimly
from
the
shadow
and
the
great
east
end
window
with
its
deep
purple
light
seemed
to
draw
the
whole
nave
up
into
its
heart
and
hold
it
there
all
was
space
and
silence
light
and
dusk
a
little
doll
of
a
verger
moved
in
the
far
distance
an
old
woman
so
quiet
that
she
seemed
only
a
shadow
passed
him
wiping
the
little
chairs
with
a
duster
it
seemed
to
jeremy
that
he
had
never
been
in
the
cathedral
before
he
stood
there
breathless
as
though
in
a
moment
something
must
inevitably
happen
although
he
did
not
think
of
it
the
moment
was
one
of
a
sequence
that
had
come
to
him
during
the
year
his
entry
into
the
theatre
with
his
uncle
his
first
conversation
with
the
the
hour
when
his
mother
had
been
so
ill
the
evening
on
the
beach
when
charlotte
had
been
frightened
the
time
when
hamlet
had
been
lost
and
he
had
slept
with
him
under
a
tree
all
these
moments
had
been
something
more
than
merely
themselves
had
had
something
behind
them
or
inside
them
for
which
simply
they
stood
as
words
stand
for
pictures
he
analysed
of
course
nothing
being
a
perfectly
healthy
small
boy
but
if
afterwards
he
looked
back
these
were
the
moments
that
he
saw
as
one
sees
stations
on
a
journey
one
day
he
would
know
for
what
they
stood
he
simply
now
waited
there
as
though
he
expected
something
to
happen
thoughts
slipped
through
his
mind
quite
casually
whether
hamlet
were
behaving
well
outside
what
the
old
lady
did
when
she
was
tired
of
dusting
who
the
stone
figure
lying
near
him
might
be
a
figure
very
fine
with
his
ruff
and
his
peaked
beard
his
arms
folded
his
toes
pointing
upwards
whether
the
body
were
inside
the
stone
like
a
mummy
or
underneath
the
ground
how
strangely
different
the
nave
looked
now
from
its
sunday
show
and
what
fun
it
would
be
to
run
races
all
the
way
down
and
see
who
could
reach
the
golden
angels
over
the
reredos
first
he
felt
no
reverence
and
yet
a
deep
reverence
no
fear
but
nevertheless
awe
he
was
warm
and
happy
and
comfortable
and
yet
suddenly
giving
a
little
shudder
he
slipped
out
into
the
sunlight
released
hamlet
and
started
for
home
ii
back
again
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
he
felt
that
they
were
beginning
to
be
aware
of
his
departure
what
shall
we
do
this
evening
jeremy
your
last
evening
said
his
mother
everyone
looked
at
him
oh
i
do
know
he
said
uncomfortably
just
as
usual
i
you
making
him
feel
uncomfortable
said
aunt
amy
who
loved
to
explain
quite
obvious
things
you
want
it
to
be
just
an
ordinary
evening
dear
do
you
oh
i
do
know
he
said
again
hating
his
aunt
i
do
think
that
quite
the
way
to
speak
to
your
aunt
my
son
said
his
father
we
only
inquire
out
of
kindness
thinking
to
please
you
no
mary
no
more
friday
one
helping
jeremy
might
have
another
as
it
his
last
day
i
suggest
said
aunt
amy
who
was
determined
to
be
pleasant
i
do
want
any
thank
you
said
jeremy
although
it
was
treacle
pudding
which
he
loved
well
i
think
said
cole
that
we
have
high
tea
at
seven
and
the
children
shall
stay
up
afterwards
and
we
have
easy
jeremy
loved
his
mother
intensely
at
that
moment
how
did
she
know
so
exactly
what
was
right
she
made
so
little
disturbance
was
so
quiet
and
was
never
angry
and
yet
she
was
always
right
when
the
others
were
always
wrong
she
knew
that
above
all
things
he
loved
high
tea
fish
pie
and
boiled
eggs
and
tea
and
jam
and
cake
a
horrible
meal
that
his
later
judgment
would
utterly
condemn
but
nevertheless
something
so
cosy
and
so
comfortable
that
no
later
meal
would
ever
be
able
to
rival
it
in
those
qualities
oh
that
will
be
lovely
he
said
his
face
shining
all
over
nevertheless
as
the
afternoon
advanced
a
strange
new
sense
of
insecurity
unhappiness
and
forlornness
crept
increasingly
upon
him
he
realised
that
he
had
that
morning
said
to
the
town
and
now
he
felt
as
though
he
had
in
some
way
hurt
or
insulted
it
and
all
the
afternoon
he
was
saying
farewell
to
the
house
he
did
not
wander
from
room
to
room
but
rather
sat
up
in
the
schoolroom
pretending
to
mend
a
fishing
rod
which
monk
had
given
him
that
summer
he
did
not
really
care
about
the
rod
he
was
not
even
thinking
of
it
he
heard
all
the
sounds
of
the
house
as
he
sat
there
he
could
tell
all
the
clocks
that
one
booming
softly
the
half
hours
was
in
his
mother
bedroom
there
was
a
rattle
and
a
whirr
and
there
came
the
on
the
stairs
there
was
the
fast
cheap
careless
chatter
of
the
little
clock
on
the
schoolroom
mantelpiece
there
was
the
whisper
of
miss
jones
watch
which
she
had
put
out
on
the
table
to
mark
the
time
of
mary
sewing
by
there
were
all
the
regular
sounds
of
the
house
the
distant
closing
of
doors
deep
down
in
the
heart
of
the
house
someone
was
using
a
sewing
machine
somewhere
voices
came
up
out
of
the
void
and
faded
again
someone
whistled
someone
sang
his
gloom
increased
he
was
exchanging
a
world
he
knew
for
a
world
that
he
did
not
know
and
he
could
not
escape
the
feeling
that
he
was
in
some
way
insulting
this
world
that
he
was
leaving
he
bothered
himself
all
the
afternoon
with
unnecessary
stupid
affairs
to
cover
his
deep
discomfort
he
whistled
carelessly
and
out
of
tune
he
poked
the
fire
and
walked
about
he
was
increasingly
aware
of
hamlet
and
mary
mary
was
determined
so
hard
that
she
would
show
no
emotion
at
all
that
she
was
a
painful
sight
to
witness
she
scarcely
spoke
to
him
and
only
answered
in
monosyllables
if
he
asked
her
something
and
hamlet
had
suddenly
discovered
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
unusual
he
had
expected
in
the
first
place
to
be
taken
for
a
walk
that
afternoon
then
his
master
was
very
busy
doing
nothing
which
was
most
unusual
then
at
tea
time
his
worst
suspicions
were
confirmed
jeremy
suddenly
made
a
fuss
of
him
pouring
his
tea
into
his
saucer
giving
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
jam
and
an
extra
lump
of
sugar
hamlet
drank
his
tea
and
ate
his
bread
and
jam
thoughtfully
they
were
very
nice
but
what
was
the
matter
he
looked
up
through
his
hair
and
discovered
that
his
master
eyes
were
restless
and
unhappy
and
that
he
was
thinking
of
things
that
disturbed
him
he
went
away
to
the
fire
and
sitting
on
his
haunches
gazing
in
his
metaphysical
way
at
the
flames
considered
the
matter
jeremy
came
over
to
him
and
drawing
him
back
to
him
laid
his
head
upon
his
knee
and
so
held
him
hamlet
did
not
move
save
occasionally
to
sigh
and
once
or
twice
to
snap
in
a
sudden
way
that
he
had
at
an
imaginary
fly
he
thought
that
in
all
probability
his
master
had
been
punished
for
something
and
in
this
he
was
deeply
sympathetic
never
seeing
why
his
master
need
be
punished
for
anything
and
resenting
the
stupidity
of
human
beings
with
their
eternal
desire
to
be
in
some
way
or
other
asserting
their
authority
gradually
in
front
of
the
hot
fire
both
boy
and
dog
fell
asleep
jeremy
dreams
were
confused
bewildered
distressing
he
was
struggling
to
find
something
was
always
climbing
higher
and
higher
to
discover
it
only
to
be
told
that
in
the
end
he
was
in
the
place
where
he
had
begun
hamlet
dream
was
of
an
enormous
succulent
bone
that
was
pulled
away
from
him
so
soon
as
he
snapped
at
it
they
both
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
that
it
was
time
for
high
tea
iii
throughout
the
evening
jeremy
was
more
and
more
lonely
he
had
never
before
felt
so
deep
an
affection
for
the
family
and
never
been
so
utterly
unable
to
express
it
it
was
as
though
during
the
whole
year
he
had
by
his
own
will
been
slipping
away
from
them
and
now
they
had
gone
too
far
for
him
to
call
them
back
he
sat
on
the
floor
at
his
mother
feet
whilst
she
read
midshipman
it
was
all
so
cosy
the
room
was
so
comfortable
with
all
the
familiar
pictures
and
photographs
and
books
and
helen
and
mary
diligently
sewing
and
hamlet
stretched
out
in
front
of
the
fire
his
nose
on
his
paws
six
months
ago
jeremy
would
have
felt
utterly
and
absolutely
part
of
it
now
he
was
outside
it
and
at
the
same
time
was
inside
nothing
else
it
might
be
that
in
a
week
time
he
would
be
so
familiar
with
his
new
world
that
he
would
be
as
happy
as
a
cricket
he
did
not
know
he
only
knew
that
at
this
moment
he
would
have
given
all
that
he
had
to
fling
his
arms
round
his
mother
neck
to
be
hugged
and
kissed
and
nursed
by
her
and
that
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
died
rather
than
do
such
a
thing
the
evening
came
to
an
end
the
girls
got
up
and
said
his
mother
kissed
him
holding
him
perhaps
for
a
moment
longer
than
usual
but
at
that
same
instant
she
said
oh
i
must
remind
ella
about
the
seven
breakfast
again
she
always
has
to
be
told
everything
the
girls
went
on
ahead
jeremy
and
hamlet
following
close
behind
jeremy
found
himself
alone
in
the
schoolroom
where
the
fire
was
very
low
giving
only
little
spurts
and
flashes
that
ran
like
golden
snakes
suddenly
through
the
darkness
moved
by
an
impulse
he
went
to
the
and
opening
it
put
his
hand
quite
by
chance
on
the
toy
village
the
toy
village
he
laid
it
out
and
spread
it
on
the
floor
he
could
not
see
but
he
knew
every
piece
by
heart
and
he
laid
it
all
out
the
church
and
the
flower
garden
and
the
noah
house
and
the
village
street
the
animals
and
the
noahs
what
centuries
ago
that
birthday
was
what
worlds
away
how
excited
he
had
been
and
now
with
a
sudden
impatient
gesture
he
tumbled
the
pieces
over
on
to
their
sides
then
quickly
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
the
dark
went
into
his
bedroom
and
began
to
undress
iv
in
the
morning
events
moved
too
quickly
for
thought
he
had
still
the
same
lonely
pain
at
his
heart
but
now
he
simply
was
not
given
time
to
consider
it
his
father
called
him
into
the
study
he
gave
him
ten
shillings
and
a
new
jeremy
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
come
close
to
him
and
be
a
friend
of
a
new
kind
to
him
he
heard
in
a
distance
such
words
as
a
new
world
full
of
trial
and
temptation
god
sees
us
work
at
your
latin
cricket
and
football
prayers
every
night
but
he
could
feel
no
emotion
nothing
but
terror
lest
some
sudden
stupid
emotional
scene
should
occur
nothing
occurred
he
kissed
his
father
and
went
then
quite
suddenly
just
as
he
came
down
in
his
hat
and
coat
and
heard
that
the
cab
was
there
his
restraint
melted
he
was
free
and
impulsive
and
natural
he
kissed
mary
telling
her
you
may
have
my
toy
village
i
like
you
to
yes
rather
i
mean
he
kissed
helen
and
barbara
and
then
held
to
his
mother
not
caring
whether
all
the
world
was
there
to
see
the
old
life
was
going
with
him
he
was
not
leaving
it
after
all
the
town
and
the
house
and
all
the
things
to
which
he
had
thought
that
he
had
said
were
going
with
him
hamlet
he
found
the
dog
struggling
to
get
into
the
cab
that
was
more
than
he
could
stand
he
was
not
going
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
but
the
only
way
to
be
secure
was
to
get
into
the
cab
and
hide
there
he
caught
hamlet
head
gave
it
a
kiss
then
jumped
in
catching
a
last
glimpse
of
the
family
grouped
at
the
door
the
servants
at
the
window
the
old
garden
with
the
dead
leaves
gathered
upon
it
hamlet
held
struggling
in
mary
arms
he
choked
down
his
sobs
felt
the
ten
shillings
in
his
pocket
then
with
a
mighty
resolve
to
which
it
seemed
that
the
labours
of
hercules
were
as
nothing
leaned
out
and
waved
his
hand
the
cab
rolled
off
hamlet
lay
down
upon
the
mat
just
inside
the
someone
tried
to
pull
him
away
he
growled
showing
his
teeth
his
master
had
gone
out
he
would
wait
for
his
return
and
no
one
should
move
him
