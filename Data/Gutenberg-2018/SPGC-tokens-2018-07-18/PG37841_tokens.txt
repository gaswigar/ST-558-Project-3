nietzsche
s
first
lengthy
contribution
to
literature
his
previous
works
comprise
only
the
philological
treatises
birth
of
and
the
essays
on
strauss
schopenhauer
and
wagner
in
out
of
with
the
volumes
of
nietzsche
appears
for
the
first
time
in
his
true
colours
as
philosopher
his
purely
scholarly
publications
his
essays
in
literary
and
musical
the
essay
on
richard
wagner
at
of
course
foreshadowed
his
work
as
a
thinker
these
efforts
however
had
been
mere
fragments
from
which
hardly
any
one
could
observe
that
a
new
philosophical
star
had
arisen
on
the
horizon
but
by
the
period
of
transition
had
definitely
set
in
outwardly
the
new
departure
is
marked
by
nietzsche
s
resignation
in
that
year
of
his
professorship
at
resignation
due
partly
to
and
partly
to
his
conviction
that
his
was
a
voice
that
should
speak
not
merely
to
students
of
philology
but
to
all
mankind
nietzsche
himself
characterises
as
the
monument
of
a
he
might
as
fitly
have
called
it
the
of
a
new
harvest
now
for
the
first
time
he
practises
the
form
which
he
was
to
make
so
peculiarly
his
own
we
are
we
may
well
the
book
came
as
a
surprise
even
to
his
most
intimate
friends
wagner
had
already
seen
how
matters
stood
at
the
publication
of
the
first
part
and
the
gulf
between
the
two
probably
widened
on
the
appearance
of
the
second
part
several
aphorisms
are
here
varying
in
length
as
in
subject
and
ranging
over
the
whole
human
emotions
and
aspirations
the
religions
and
cultures
and
philosophies
the
arts
and
literatures
and
politics
of
mankind
equally
varied
is
the
range
of
style
the
incisive
epigram
and
the
passage
of
pure
poetry
jostling
each
other
on
the
same
page
in
this
curious
power
of
alternating
between
cynicism
and
lyricism
nietzsche
appears
as
the
prose
counterpart
of
heine
one
or
two
of
the
aphorisms
are
of
peculiar
interest
to
english
readers
the
essay
as
it
may
almost
be
called
on
sterne
no
does
ample
justice
if
not
more
than
justice
to
that
wayward
genius
the
allusion
to
milton
no
will
come
as
somewhat
of
a
shock
to
english
readers
especially
to
those
who
hold
that
in
milton
art
triumphed
over
puritanism
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
nietzsche
s
view
coincides
with
goethe
s
the
dictum
that
shakespeare
s
gold
is
to
be
valued
for
its
quantity
rather
than
its
quality
no
also
betrays
a
certain
legacy
from
that
france
which
appealed
so
strongly
to
nietzsche
on
its
intellectual
side
to
nietzsche
as
to
voltaire
shakespeare
is
after
all
the
great
the
title
of
the
book
may
be
explained
from
a
phrase
in
spake
verily
even
the
greatest
i
the
keynote
of
these
volumes
is
indeed
disillusion
and
destruction
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
all
men
must
sweep
away
the
rubbish
before
they
can
build
hence
we
find
here
little
of
the
constructive
philosophy
of
far
as
he
had
a
constructive
philosophy
the
superman
appears
but
faintly
the
doctrine
of
eternal
recurrence
not
at
all
for
this
very
reason
is
perhaps
the
best
for
the
study
of
nietzsche
the
difficulties
in
style
and
thought
of
the
later
that
at
times
become
insuperable
in
spake
here
practically
absent
the
book
may
in
fact
almost
be
described
as
popular
bearing
the
same
relation
to
nietzsche
s
later
productions
as
wagner
s
and
bear
to
the
the
translator
s
thanks
are
due
to
thomas
common
for
his
careful
revision
of
the
manuscript
and
many
valuable
suggestions
preface
one
should
only
speak
where
one
can
not
remain
silent
and
only
speak
of
what
one
has
rest
is
all
chatter
literature
bad
breeding
my
writings
speak
only
of
my
conquests
i
am
in
them
with
all
that
is
hostile
to
me
or
if
a
more
haughty
expression
be
permitted
it
may
be
guessed
that
i
have
many
below
me
but
first
i
always
needed
time
convalescence
distance
separation
before
i
felt
the
stirrings
of
a
desire
to
flay
despoil
lay
bare
represent
or
whatever
one
likes
to
call
it
for
the
additional
knowledge
of
the
world
something
that
i
had
lived
through
and
outlived
something
done
or
suffered
hence
all
my
writings
one
exception
important
it
is
true
be
always
tell
of
a
some
even
like
the
first
three
out
of
must
be
thrown
back
before
the
period
of
creation
and
experience
of
a
previously
published
book
birth
of
in
the
case
cited
as
any
one
with
subtle
powers
of
observation
and
comparison
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
wrathful
outburst
against
the
germanism
smugness
and
raggedness
of
speech
of
old
david
strauss
the
contents
of
the
first
out
of
gave
a
vent
to
feelings
that
had
inspired
me
long
before
as
a
student
in
the
midst
of
german
culture
and
cultured
philistinism
i
claim
the
paternity
of
the
now
much
used
and
misused
phrase
cultured
philistinism
what
i
said
against
the
historical
disease
i
said
as
one
who
had
slowly
and
laboriously
recovered
from
that
disease
and
who
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
renounce
history
in
the
future
because
he
had
suffered
from
her
in
the
past
when
in
the
third
out
of
i
gave
expression
to
my
reverence
for
my
first
and
only
teacher
the
arthur
should
now
give
it
a
far
more
personal
and
emphatic
was
for
my
part
already
in
the
throes
of
moral
scepticism
and
dissolution
that
is
as
much
concerned
with
the
criticism
as
with
the
study
of
all
pessimism
down
to
the
present
day
i
already
did
not
believe
in
a
blessed
thing
as
the
people
say
not
even
in
schopenhauer
it
was
at
this
very
period
that
an
unpublished
essay
of
mine
on
truth
and
falsehood
in
an
sense
came
into
being
even
my
ceremonial
oration
in
honour
of
richard
wagner
on
the
occasion
of
his
triumphal
celebration
at
bayreuth
in
signifies
the
greatest
triumph
that
an
artist
has
ever
work
that
bears
the
strongest
stamp
of
individuality
was
in
the
background
an
act
of
homage
and
gratitude
to
a
bit
of
the
past
in
me
to
the
fairest
but
most
perilous
calm
of
my
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
severance
and
a
farewell
was
richard
wagner
mistaken
on
this
point
i
do
not
think
so
so
long
as
we
still
love
we
do
not
paint
such
pictures
we
do
not
yet
examine
we
do
not
place
ourselves
so
far
away
as
is
essential
for
one
who
examining
needs
at
least
a
secret
antagonism
that
of
an
opposite
point
of
view
it
is
said
on
page
of
the
work
itself
with
an
insidious
melancholy
application
that
was
perhaps
understood
by
few
the
composure
that
gave
me
the
to
speak
after
many
intervening
years
of
solitude
and
abstinence
first
came
with
the
book
to
which
this
second
preface
and
apologia
is
dedicated
as
a
book
for
free
spirits
it
shows
some
trace
of
that
almost
cheerful
and
inquisitive
coldness
of
the
psychologist
who
has
him
many
painful
things
that
he
keeps
him
and
moreover
establishes
them
for
himself
and
fixes
them
firmly
as
with
a
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
at
such
sharp
ticklish
work
blood
flows
now
and
again
that
indeed
the
psychologist
has
blood
on
his
fingers
and
not
on
his
fingers
the
maxims
and
were
in
the
first
place
like
wanderer
and
his
published
separately
as
continuations
and
appendices
to
the
human
human
for
free
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
continuation
and
confirmation
of
an
intellectual
cure
consisting
in
a
course
of
such
as
my
instinct
which
had
always
remained
healthy
had
itself
discovered
and
prescribed
against
a
temporary
attack
of
the
most
dangerous
form
of
romantics
after
a
convalescence
of
six
years
i
may
well
be
permitted
to
collect
these
same
writings
and
publish
them
as
a
second
volume
of
perhaps
if
surveyed
together
they
will
more
clearly
and
effectively
teach
their
lesson
of
health
that
may
be
recommended
as
a
to
the
more
intellectual
natures
of
the
rising
generation
here
speaks
a
pessimist
who
has
often
leaped
out
of
his
skin
but
has
always
returned
into
it
thus
a
pessimist
with
goodwill
towards
all
events
a
romanticist
no
longer
and
has
not
a
pessimist
who
possesses
this
serpentine
knack
of
changing
his
skin
the
right
to
read
a
lecture
to
our
pessimists
of
who
are
one
and
all
still
in
the
toils
of
romanticism
or
at
least
to
show
them
how
it
it
was
then
in
fact
high
time
to
bid
farewell
and
i
soon
received
proof
richard
wagner
who
seemed
but
was
in
reality
only
a
decayed
and
despairing
romantic
suddenly
collapsed
helpless
and
broken
before
the
christian
cross
was
there
not
a
single
german
with
eyes
in
his
head
and
sympathy
in
his
heart
for
this
appalling
spectacle
was
i
the
only
one
whom
he
in
any
case
the
unexpected
event
illumined
for
me
in
one
lightning
flash
the
place
that
i
had
abandoned
and
also
the
horror
that
is
felt
by
every
one
who
is
unconscious
of
a
great
danger
until
he
has
passed
through
it
as
i
went
forward
alone
i
shuddered
and
not
long
afterwards
i
was
ill
or
rather
more
than
weary
from
my
ceaseless
disappointment
about
all
that
remained
to
make
us
modern
men
enthusiastic
at
the
thought
of
the
power
work
hope
youth
love
flung
to
all
the
winds
weary
from
disgust
at
the
effeminacy
and
undisciplined
rhapsody
of
this
romanticism
at
the
whole
tissue
of
idealistic
lies
and
softening
of
conscience
which
here
again
had
won
the
day
over
one
of
the
bravest
of
men
last
and
not
least
weary
from
the
bitterness
of
an
inexorable
after
this
disappointment
i
was
doomed
to
mistrust
more
thoroughly
to
despise
more
thoroughly
to
be
alone
more
thoroughly
than
ever
before
my
had
it
flown
did
it
not
look
now
as
if
my
task
were
retreating
from
me
and
as
if
i
should
for
a
long
future
period
have
no
more
right
to
it
what
was
i
to
do
to
endure
this
most
terrible
privation
began
by
entirely
forbidding
myself
all
romantic
music
that
ambiguous
pompous
stifling
art
which
robs
the
mind
of
its
sternness
and
its
joyousness
and
provides
a
fertile
soil
for
every
kind
of
vague
yearning
and
spongy
sensuality
cave
musicam
is
even
my
advice
to
all
who
are
enough
of
men
to
cling
to
purity
in
matters
of
the
intellect
such
music
enervates
softens
feminises
its
eternal
feminine
draws
my
first
suspicion
my
most
immediate
precaution
was
directed
against
romantic
music
if
i
hoped
for
anything
at
all
from
music
it
was
in
the
expectation
of
the
coming
of
a
musician
bold
subtle
malignant
southern
healthy
enough
to
take
an
immortal
revenge
upon
that
other
music
lonely
now
and
miserably
i
took
sides
not
without
resentment
myself
and
everything
that
hurt
me
and
was
hard
to
me
thus
i
once
more
found
the
way
to
that
courageous
pessimism
that
is
the
antithesis
of
all
romantic
fraud
and
as
it
seems
to
me
the
way
to
myself
to
my
task
that
hidden
masterful
something
for
which
we
long
have
no
name
until
at
last
it
shows
itself
as
our
tyrant
in
us
exacts
a
terrible
price
for
every
attempt
that
we
make
to
escape
him
or
give
him
the
slip
for
every
premature
act
of
for
every
reconciliation
with
those
to
whom
we
do
not
belong
for
every
activity
however
reputable
which
turns
us
aside
from
our
main
purpose
yes
even
for
every
virtue
that
would
fain
protect
us
from
the
cruelty
of
our
most
individual
responsibility
disease
is
always
the
answer
when
we
wish
to
have
doubts
of
our
rights
to
our
own
task
when
we
begin
to
make
it
easier
for
ourselves
in
any
way
how
strange
and
how
terrible
it
is
our
very
alleviations
for
which
we
have
to
make
the
severest
atonement
and
if
we
want
to
return
to
health
we
have
no
choice
must
load
ourselves
than
we
were
ever
laden
before
it
was
then
that
i
learnt
the
hermitical
habit
of
speech
acquired
only
by
the
most
silent
and
suffering
i
spoke
without
witnesses
or
rather
indifferent
to
the
presence
of
witnesses
so
as
not
to
suffer
from
silence
i
spoke
of
various
things
that
did
not
concern
me
in
a
style
that
gave
the
impression
that
they
did
then
too
i
learnt
the
art
of
showing
myself
cheerful
objective
inquisitive
in
the
presence
of
all
that
is
healthy
and
this
in
an
invalid
as
it
seems
to
me
his
good
taste
nevertheless
a
more
subtle
eye
and
sympathy
will
not
miss
what
perhaps
gives
a
charm
to
these
fact
that
here
speaks
one
who
has
suffered
and
abstained
in
such
a
way
as
if
he
had
never
suffered
or
abstained
here
equipoise
composure
even
gratitude
towards
life
be
maintained
here
rules
a
stern
proud
ever
vigilant
ever
susceptible
will
which
has
undertaken
the
task
of
defending
life
against
pain
and
snapping
off
all
conclusions
that
are
wont
to
grow
like
poisonous
fungi
from
pain
disappointment
satiety
isolation
and
other
morasses
perhaps
this
gives
our
pessimists
a
hint
to
for
it
was
then
that
i
hit
upon
the
aphorism
a
sufferer
has
as
yet
no
right
to
pessimism
and
that
i
engaged
in
a
tedious
patient
campaign
against
the
unscientific
first
principles
of
all
romantic
pessimism
which
seeks
to
magnify
and
interpret
individual
personal
experiences
into
general
judgments
universal
was
then
in
short
that
i
sighted
a
new
world
optimism
for
the
sake
of
restitution
in
order
at
some
time
to
have
the
right
to
become
a
you
understand
that
just
as
a
physician
transfers
his
patient
to
totally
strange
surroundings
in
order
to
displace
him
from
his
entire
past
his
troubles
friends
letters
duties
stupid
mistakes
and
painful
memories
and
teaches
him
to
stretch
out
hands
and
senses
towards
new
nourishment
a
new
sun
a
new
future
so
i
as
physician
and
invalid
in
one
forced
myself
into
an
utterly
different
and
untried
zone
of
the
soul
and
particularly
into
an
absorbing
journey
to
a
strange
land
a
strange
atmosphere
into
a
curiosity
for
all
that
was
strange
a
long
process
of
roaming
seeking
changing
followed
a
distaste
for
fixity
of
any
dislike
for
clumsy
affirmation
and
negation
and
at
the
same
time
a
dietary
and
discipline
which
aimed
at
making
it
as
easy
as
possible
for
the
soul
to
fly
high
and
above
all
constantly
to
fly
away
in
fact
a
minimum
of
life
an
unfettering
from
all
coarser
forms
of
sensuality
an
independence
in
the
midst
of
all
marks
of
outward
disfavour
together
with
the
pride
in
being
able
to
live
in
the
midst
of
all
this
disfavour
a
little
cynicism
perhaps
a
little
of
the
tub
of
diogenes
a
good
deal
of
whimsical
happiness
whimsical
gaiety
much
calm
light
subtle
folly
hidden
this
produced
in
the
end
a
great
spiritual
strengthening
a
growing
joy
and
exuberance
of
health
life
itself
rewards
us
for
our
tenacious
will
to
life
for
such
a
long
war
as
i
waged
against
the
pessimistic
weariness
of
life
even
for
every
observant
glance
of
our
gratitude
glances
that
do
not
miss
the
smallest
most
delicate
most
fugitive
gifts
in
the
end
we
receive
life
s
great
gifts
perhaps
the
greatest
it
can
regain
task
should
my
history
of
an
illness
and
a
convalescence
for
it
resulted
in
a
only
my
personal
experience
and
merely
just
my
human
i
would
fain
believe
the
reverse
for
i
am
becoming
more
and
more
confident
that
my
books
of
travel
were
not
penned
for
my
sole
benefit
as
appeared
for
a
time
to
be
the
case
may
i
after
six
years
of
growing
assurance
send
them
once
more
on
a
journey
for
an
experiment
i
commend
them
particularly
to
the
ears
and
hearts
of
those
who
are
afflicted
with
some
sort
of
a
past
and
have
enough
intellect
left
to
suffer
even
intellectually
from
their
past
but
above
all
would
i
commend
them
to
you
whose
burden
is
heaviest
you
choice
spirits
most
encompassed
with
perils
most
intellectual
most
courageous
who
must
be
the
of
the
modern
soul
and
as
such
be
versed
in
its
in
whom
is
concentrated
all
of
disease
poison
or
danger
that
can
exist
whose
lot
decrees
that
you
must
be
more
sick
than
any
individual
because
you
are
not
mere
individuals
whose
consolation
it
is
to
know
and
ah
to
walk
the
path
to
a
new
health
a
health
of
and
the
day
after
you
men
of
destiny
triumphant
conquerors
of
time
the
healthiest
and
the
strongest
you
to
express
finally
in
a
single
formula
my
opposition
to
the
romantic
pessimism
of
the
abstinent
the
unfortunate
the
conquered
there
is
a
will
to
the
tragic
and
to
pessimism
which
is
a
sign
as
much
of
the
severity
as
of
the
strength
of
the
intellect
taste
emotion
conscience
with
this
will
in
our
hearts
we
do
not
fear
but
we
investigate
ourselves
the
terrible
and
the
problematical
elements
characteristic
of
all
existence
behind
such
a
will
stand
courage
and
pride
and
the
desire
for
a
really
great
enemy
that
was
pessimistic
outlook
from
the
new
outlook
methinks
an
outlook
that
even
at
this
day
is
new
and
strange
to
this
moment
i
hold
to
it
firmly
and
if
it
will
be
believed
not
only
myself
but
occasionally
myself
you
would
prefer
to
have
that
proved
first
well
what
else
does
all
this
long
upper
engadine
part
miscellaneous
maxims
and
opinions
to
the
disillusioned
in
you
hitherto
believed
in
the
highest
value
of
life
and
now
find
yourselves
disillusioned
must
you
immediately
get
rid
of
life
at
the
lowest
possible
price
can
even
become
overnice
as
regards
the
clearness
of
concepts
how
disgusted
one
is
then
at
having
truck
with
the
the
hazy
the
aspiring
the
doubting
how
ridiculous
and
yet
not
is
their
eternal
fluttering
and
straining
without
ever
being
able
to
fly
or
to
grasp
the
wooers
of
who
realises
at
last
how
long
and
how
thoroughly
he
has
been
befooled
embraces
out
of
spite
even
the
ugliest
reality
so
that
in
the
long
run
of
the
world
s
history
the
best
men
have
always
been
wooers
of
reality
for
the
best
have
always
been
longest
and
most
thoroughly
deceived
advance
of
difference
between
past
and
present
freethinking
can
not
better
be
characterised
than
by
that
aphorism
for
the
recognition
and
expression
of
which
all
the
fearlessness
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
needed
and
which
even
then
if
measured
by
our
modern
view
sinks
into
an
unconscious
naïveté
i
mean
voltaire
s
aphorism
mon
ami
l
erreur
aussi
a
son
a
hereditary
sin
of
have
at
all
times
appropriated
and
the
maxims
of
censors
of
men
moralists
by
taking
them
over
without
qualification
and
trying
to
prove
as
necessary
what
the
moralists
only
meant
as
a
rough
indication
or
as
a
truth
suited
to
their
or
for
a
single
decade
moreover
the
philosophers
thought
that
they
were
thereby
raising
themselves
above
the
moralists
thus
it
will
be
found
that
the
celebrated
teachings
of
schopenhauer
as
to
the
supremacy
of
the
will
over
the
intellect
of
the
immutability
of
character
the
negativity
of
errors
in
the
sense
in
which
he
understands
upon
principles
of
popular
wisdom
enunciated
by
the
moralists
take
the
very
word
will
which
schopenhauer
twisted
so
as
to
become
a
common
denotation
of
several
human
conditions
and
with
which
he
filled
a
gap
in
the
language
to
his
own
great
advantage
in
so
far
as
he
was
a
moralist
for
he
became
free
to
speak
of
the
will
as
pascal
had
spoken
of
it
in
the
hands
of
its
creator
schopenhauer
s
will
through
the
philosophic
craze
for
generalisation
already
turned
out
to
be
a
bane
to
knowledge
for
this
will
was
made
into
a
poetic
metaphor
when
it
was
held
that
all
things
in
nature
possess
will
finally
that
it
might
be
applied
to
all
kinds
of
disordered
mysticism
the
word
was
misused
by
a
fraudulent
convention
so
now
all
our
fashionable
philosophers
repeat
it
and
seem
to
be
perfectly
certain
that
all
things
have
a
will
and
are
in
fact
one
will
according
to
the
description
generally
given
of
this
this
is
much
as
if
one
should
positively
try
to
have
the
stupid
devil
for
one
s
god
against
visionary
denies
the
truth
to
himself
the
liar
only
to
others
enmity
to
we
make
it
clear
to
any
one
that
strictly
he
can
never
speak
of
truth
but
only
of
probability
and
of
its
degrees
we
generally
discover
from
the
undisguised
joy
of
our
pupil
how
greatly
men
prefer
the
uncertainty
of
their
intellectual
horizon
and
how
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
hate
truth
because
of
its
this
due
to
a
secret
fear
felt
by
all
that
the
light
of
truth
may
at
some
time
be
turned
too
brightly
upon
themselves
to
their
wish
to
be
of
some
consequence
and
accordingly
their
concealment
from
the
world
of
what
they
are
or
is
it
to
be
traced
to
their
horror
of
the
brilliant
light
to
which
their
crepuscular
easily
dazzled
souls
are
not
accustomed
so
that
hate
it
they
must
christian
with
his
question
what
is
truth
is
now
gleefully
brought
on
the
scene
as
an
advocate
of
christ
in
order
to
cast
suspicion
on
all
that
is
known
or
knowable
as
being
mere
appearance
and
to
erect
the
cross
on
the
appalling
background
of
the
impossibility
of
knowledge
natural
law
a
phrase
of
you
talk
so
delightedly
of
nature
acting
according
to
law
you
must
either
assume
that
all
things
in
nature
follow
their
law
from
a
voluntary
obedience
imposed
by
which
case
you
admire
the
morality
of
nature
or
you
are
enchanted
with
the
idea
of
a
creative
mechanician
who
has
made
a
most
cunning
watch
with
human
beings
as
accessory
through
the
expression
conformity
to
law
then
becomes
more
human
and
a
coign
of
refuge
in
the
last
instance
for
mythological
reveries
fallen
forfeit
to
misty
philosophers
and
obscurers
of
the
world
in
other
words
all
metaphysicians
of
coarse
or
refined
texture
are
seized
with
eyeache
earache
and
toothache
when
they
begin
to
suspect
that
there
is
truth
in
the
saying
all
philosophy
has
from
now
fallen
forfeit
to
in
view
of
their
aches
and
pains
we
may
pardon
them
for
throwing
stones
and
filth
at
him
who
talks
like
this
but
this
teaching
may
itself
thereby
become
dirty
and
disreputable
for
a
time
and
lose
in
effect
the
pessimist
of
the
whose
intellect
is
really
free
will
think
freely
about
the
intellect
itself
and
will
not
shut
his
eyes
to
certain
terrible
aspects
of
its
source
and
tendency
for
this
reason
others
will
perhaps
designate
him
the
bitterest
opponent
of
free
thought
and
give
him
that
dreadful
abusive
name
of
pessimist
of
the
intellect
accustomed
as
they
are
to
typify
a
man
not
by
his
strong
point
his
virtue
but
by
the
quality
that
is
most
foreign
to
his
nature
the
metaphysicians
all
who
talk
so
boastfully
of
the
scientific
basis
of
their
metaphysics
it
is
best
to
make
no
reply
it
is
enough
to
tug
at
the
bundle
that
they
rather
shyly
keep
hidden
behind
their
backs
if
one
succeeds
in
lifting
it
the
results
of
that
scientific
basis
come
to
light
to
their
great
confusion
a
dear
little
god
a
genteel
immortality
perhaps
a
little
spiritualism
and
in
any
case
a
complicated
mass
of
and
occasional
harmfulness
of
utility
involved
in
the
unchecked
investigation
of
knowledge
is
so
constantly
proved
in
a
hundred
different
ways
that
one
must
remember
to
include
in
the
bargain
the
subtler
and
rarer
damage
which
individuals
must
suffer
on
that
account
the
chemist
can
not
avoid
occasionally
being
poisoned
or
burnt
at
his
experiments
what
applies
to
the
chemist
is
true
of
the
whole
of
our
culture
this
it
may
be
added
clearly
shows
that
knowledge
should
provide
itself
with
healing
balsam
against
burns
and
should
always
have
antidotes
ready
against
poisons
the
craving
of
the
philistine
thinks
that
his
most
urgent
need
is
a
purple
patch
or
turban
of
metaphysics
nor
will
he
let
it
slip
yet
he
would
look
less
ridiculous
without
this
adornment
all
that
enthusiasts
say
in
favour
of
their
gospel
or
their
master
they
are
defending
themselves
however
much
they
comport
themselves
as
the
judges
and
not
the
accused
because
they
are
involuntarily
reminded
almost
at
every
moment
that
they
are
exceptions
and
have
to
assert
their
legitimacy
the
good
seduces
to
good
things
even
all
good
books
that
are
written
against
life
are
strong
means
of
attraction
to
life
the
happiness
of
the
when
we
hear
the
metaphysicians
and
prophets
of
the
speak
we
others
feel
indeed
that
we
are
the
poor
in
spirit
but
that
ours
is
the
heavenly
kingdom
of
change
with
spring
and
autumn
summer
and
winter
and
theirs
the
with
its
grey
everlasting
frosts
and
thus
soliloquised
a
man
as
he
walked
in
the
morning
sunshine
a
man
who
in
his
pursuit
of
history
has
constantly
changed
not
only
his
mind
but
his
heart
in
contrast
to
the
metaphysicians
he
is
happy
to
harbour
in
himself
not
an
immortal
soul
but
many
souls
three
varieties
of
are
streaming
flowing
trickling
mineral
springs
and
three
corresponding
varieties
of
thinkers
the
layman
values
them
by
the
volume
of
the
water
the
expert
by
the
contents
of
the
other
words
by
the
elements
in
them
that
are
not
water
the
picture
of
task
of
painting
the
picture
of
life
often
as
it
has
been
attempted
by
poets
and
philosophers
is
nevertheless
irrational
even
in
the
hands
of
the
greatest
pictures
and
miniatures
of
one
life
come
into
being
and
indeed
no
other
result
is
possible
while
in
the
process
of
developing
a
thing
that
develops
can
not
mirror
itself
as
fixed
and
permanent
as
a
truth
will
have
no
gods
before
belief
in
truth
begins
with
the
doubt
of
all
truths
in
which
one
has
previously
believed
where
silence
is
we
speak
of
freethinking
as
of
a
highly
dangerous
journey
over
glaciers
and
frozen
seas
we
find
that
those
who
do
not
care
to
travel
on
this
track
are
offended
as
if
they
had
been
reproached
with
cowardice
and
weak
knees
the
difficult
which
we
find
to
be
beyond
our
powers
must
not
even
be
mentioned
in
our
presence
in
most
serious
parody
i
ever
heard
was
this
in
the
beginning
was
the
nonsense
and
the
nonsense
was
with
god
and
the
nonsense
was
idealist
is
incorrigible
if
he
be
thrown
out
of
his
heaven
he
makes
himself
a
suitable
ideal
out
of
hell
disillusion
him
and
lo
he
will
embrace
disillusionment
with
no
less
ardour
than
he
recently
embraced
hope
in
so
far
as
his
impulse
belongs
to
the
great
incurable
impulses
of
human
nature
he
can
bring
about
tragic
destinies
and
later
become
a
subject
for
tragedy
himself
for
such
tragedies
as
deal
with
the
incurable
implacable
inevitable
in
the
lot
and
character
of
man
applause
itself
as
the
continuation
of
the
eyes
and
an
amiable
smile
are
the
tributes
of
applause
paid
to
all
the
great
comedy
of
world
and
this
applause
is
a
comedy
within
a
comedy
meant
to
tempt
the
other
spectators
to
a
courage
for
who
has
not
the
courage
to
allow
himself
and
his
work
to
be
considered
tedious
is
certainly
no
intellect
of
the
first
rank
whether
in
the
arts
or
in
the
scoffer
who
happened
for
once
in
a
way
to
be
a
thinker
might
add
with
a
glance
at
the
world
and
at
history
god
did
not
possess
this
courage
for
he
wanted
to
make
and
he
made
all
things
so
from
the
most
intimate
experience
of
the
is
harder
for
a
man
than
to
conceive
of
an
object
impersonally
i
mean
to
see
in
it
an
object
and
not
a
person
one
may
even
ask
whether
it
is
possible
for
him
to
dispense
for
a
single
moment
with
the
machinery
of
his
instinct
to
create
and
construct
a
personality
after
all
he
associates
with
his
thoughts
however
abstract
they
may
be
as
with
individuals
against
whom
he
must
fight
or
to
whom
he
must
attach
himself
whom
he
must
protect
support
and
nourish
let
us
watch
or
listen
to
ourselves
at
the
moment
when
we
hear
or
discover
a
new
idea
perhaps
it
displeases
us
because
it
is
so
defiant
and
so
autocratic
and
we
unconsciously
ask
ourselves
whether
we
can
not
place
a
contradiction
of
it
by
its
side
as
an
enemy
or
fasten
on
to
it
a
perhaps
or
a
sometimes
the
mere
little
word
probably
gives
us
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
for
it
shatters
the
oppressive
tyranny
of
the
unconditional
if
on
the
other
hand
the
new
idea
enters
in
gentle
shape
sweetly
patient
and
humble
and
falling
at
once
into
the
arms
of
contradiction
we
put
our
autocracy
to
the
test
in
another
way
can
we
not
come
to
the
aid
of
this
weak
creature
stroke
it
and
feed
it
give
it
strength
and
fulness
and
truth
and
even
unconditionality
is
it
possible
for
us
to
show
ourselves
parental
or
chivalrous
or
compassionate
towards
our
idea
again
we
see
here
a
judgment
and
there
a
judgment
sundered
from
each
other
never
looking
at
or
making
any
movement
towards
each
other
so
we
are
tickled
by
the
thought
whether
it
be
not
here
feasible
to
make
a
match
to
draw
a
with
the
anticipation
that
if
a
consequence
follows
this
conclusion
it
is
not
only
the
two
judgments
united
in
wedlock
but
the
matchmakers
that
will
gain
honour
if
however
we
can
not
acquire
a
hold
upon
that
thought
either
on
the
path
of
defiance
and
or
on
that
of
if
we
hold
it
to
be
true
we
submit
to
it
and
do
homage
to
it
as
a
leader
and
a
prince
give
it
a
chair
of
honour
and
speak
not
of
it
without
a
flourish
of
trumpets
for
we
are
bright
in
its
brightness
woe
to
him
who
tries
to
dim
this
brightness
perhaps
we
ourselves
one
day
grow
suspicious
of
our
idea
then
we
the
indefatigable
of
the
history
of
the
intellect
cast
it
down
from
its
throne
and
immediately
exalt
its
adversary
surely
if
this
be
considered
and
thought
out
a
little
further
no
one
will
speak
of
an
absolute
impulse
to
knowledge
why
then
does
man
prefer
the
true
to
the
untrue
in
this
secret
combat
with
in
this
generally
clandestine
of
thoughts
of
thoughts
of
thoughts
nursing
and
almsgiving
of
thoughts
for
the
same
reason
that
he
practises
honesty
in
intercourse
with
real
persons
from
habit
heredity
and
training
because
the
true
like
the
fair
and
the
just
is
more
expedient
and
more
reputable
than
the
untrue
for
in
the
realm
of
thought
it
is
difficult
to
assume
a
power
and
glory
that
are
built
on
error
or
on
falsehood
the
feeling
that
such
an
edifice
might
at
some
time
collapse
is
humiliating
to
the
of
the
is
ashamed
of
the
fragility
of
the
material
and
as
he
considers
himself
more
important
than
the
rest
of
the
world
he
would
fain
construct
nothing
that
is
less
durable
than
the
rest
of
the
world
in
his
longing
for
truth
he
embraces
the
belief
in
a
personal
immortality
the
most
arrogant
and
defiant
idea
that
exists
closely
allied
as
it
is
to
the
underlying
thought
mundus
dum
ego
salvus
sim
his
work
has
become
his
ego
he
transforms
himself
into
the
imperishable
with
its
universal
challenge
it
is
his
immeasurable
pride
that
will
only
employ
the
best
and
hardest
stones
for
the
or
what
he
holds
for
such
arrogance
has
always
been
justly
called
the
vice
of

sage
yet
without
this
vice
fruitful
in
impulses
truth
and
her
status
on
earth
would
be
in
a
parlous
plight
in
our
propensity
to
fear
our
thoughts
concepts
and
words
and
yet
to
honour
ourselves
in
them
unconsciously
to
ascribe
to
them
the
power
of
rewarding
despising
praising
and
blaming
us
and
so
to
associate
with
them
as
with
free
intellectual
personalities
as
with
independent
powers
as
with
our
lie
the
roots
of
the
remarkable
phenomenon
which
i
have
called
intellectual
thus
something
of
the
highest
moral
species
has
bloomed
from
a
black
root
the
essential
feature
of
the
black
art
of
obscurantism
is
not
its
intention
of
clouding
the
brain
but
its
attempt
to
darken
the
picture
of
the
world
and
cloud
our
idea
of
existence
it
often
employs
the
method
of
thwarting
all
illumination
of
the
intellect
but
at
times
it
uses
the
very
opposite
means
seeking
by
the
highest
refinement
of
the
intellect
to
induce
a
satiety
of
the
intellect
s
fruits
metaphysicians
who
pave
the
way
for
scepticism
and
by
their
excessive
acumen
provoke
a
distrust
of
acumen
are
excellent
instruments
of
the
more
subtle
form
of
it
possible
that
even
kant
may
be
applied
to
this
purpose
did
he
even
something
of
the
sort
for
a
time
at
least
to
judge
from
his
own
notorious
exposition
to
clear
the
way
for
belief
by
setting
limitations
to
knowledge
he
did
not
succeed
nor
did
his
followers
on
the
wolf
and
fox
tracks
of
this
highly
refined
and
dangerous
form
of
most
dangerous
of
all
for
the
black
art
here
appears
in
the
garb
of
light
by
what
kind
of
philosophy
art
is
the
mists
of
a
philosophy
succeed
in
making
all
æsthetic
phenomena
it
follows
that
these
phenomena
can
not
be
comparatively
valued
inasmuch
as
each
becomes
individually
inexplicable
but
when
once
they
can
not
be
compared
for
the
sake
of
valuation
there
arises
an
entire
a
blind
indulgence
from
this
source
springs
a
continual
diminution
of
the
enjoyment
of
art
which
is
only
distinguished
from
the
crude
satisfaction
of
a
need
by
the
highest
refinement
of
taste
and
appreciation
the
more
taste
diminishes
the
more
does
the
desire
for
art
change
and
revert
to
a
vulgar
hunger
which
the
artist
henceforth
seeks
to
appease
by
ever
coarser
fare
on
most
painful
thing
a
thinker
can
say
to
artists
is
could
ye
not
with
me
one
hour
at
the
are
many
artists
and
women
for
instance
who
work
against
the
few
that
take
a
pleasure
in
untying
the
knot
of
things
and
unravelling
their
woof
the
former
always
want
to
weave
the
woof
together
again
and
entangle
it
and
so
turn
the
conceived
into
the
unconceived
and
if
possible
inconceivable
whatever
the
result
may
be
the
woof
and
knot
always
look
rather
untidy
because
too
many
hands
are
working
and
tugging
at
them
in
the
desert
of
the
man
of
science
proceeds
on
his
modest
and
toilsome
wanderings
which
must
often
enough
be
journeys
in
the
desert
he
is
confronted
with
those
brilliant
mirages
known
as
philosophic
with
magic
powers
of
deception
they
show
him
that
the
solution
of
all
riddles
and
the
most
refreshing
draught
of
true
water
of
life
are
close
at
hand
his
weary
heart
rejoices
and
he
touches
with
his
lips
the
goal
of
all
scientific
endurance
and
hardship
so
that
almost
unconsciously
he
presses
forward
other
natures
stand
still
as
if
spellbound
by
the
beautiful
illusion
the
desert
swallows
them
up
they
become
lost
to
science
other
natures
again
that
have
often
experienced
these
subjective
consolations
become
very
disheartened
and
curse
the
salty
taste
which
these
mirages
leave
behind
in
the
mouth
and
from
which
springs
a
raging
one
s
having
come
one
step
nearer
to
any
sort
of
a
spring
the
real
the
poet
depicts
the
various
as
those
of
the
warrior
the
the
feigns
to
know
all
these
things
thoroughly
to
be
an
expert
even
in
the
exposition
of
human
actions
and
destinies
he
behaves
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
the
spinning
of
the
whole
web
of
existence
in
so
far
he
is
an
impostor
he
practises
his
frauds
on
pure
ignoramuses
and
that
is
why
he
succeeds
they
praise
him
for
his
deep
genuine
knowledge
and
lead
him
finally
into
the
delusion
that
he
really
knows
as
much
as
the
individual
experts
and
creators
yes
even
as
the
great
themselves
in
the
end
the
impostor
becomes
honest
and
actually
believes
in
his
own
sincerity
emotional
people
say
to
his
very
face
that
he
has
the
higher
truth
and
they
are
weary
of
reality
for
the
time
being
and
accept
the
poetic
dream
as
a
pleasant
relaxation
and
a
night
s
rest
for
head
and
heart
the
visions
of
the
dream
now
appear
to
them
of
more
value
because
as
has
been
said
they
find
them
more
beneficial
and
mankind
has
always
held
that
what
is
apparently
of
more
value
is
more
true
more
real
all
that
is
generally
called
reality
the
poets
conscious
of
this
power
proceed
with
intention
to
disparage
and
to
distort
into
the
uncertain
the
illusory
the
spurious
the
impure
the
sinful
sorrowful
and
deceitful
they
make
use
of
all
doubts
about
the
limits
of
knowledge
of
all
sceptical
excesses
in
order
to
spread
over
everything
the
rumpled
veil
of
uncertainty
for
they
desire
that
when
this
darkening
process
is
complete
their
wizardry
and
may
be
accepted
without
hesitation
as
the
path
to
true
truth
and
real
the
wish
to
be
just
and
the
wish
to
be
a
whose
profound
understanding
of
what
is
human
and
and
original
sense
for
facts
was
not
a
little
impaired
by
the
bright
of
his
metaphysic
the
skin
must
first
be
pulled
off
him
if
one
wants
to
find
the
real
moralist
genius
beneath
makes
this
admirable
distinction
wherein
he
comes
far
nearer
the
mark
than
he
would
himself
dare
to
admit
insight
into
the
stern
necessity
of
human
actions
is
the
boundary
line
that
divides
philosophic
from
other
he
worked
against
that
wonderful
insight
of
which
he
was
sometimes
capable
by
the
prejudice
that
he
had
in
common
with
the
moral
man
not
the
moralist
a
prejudice
that
he
expresses
quite
guilelessly
and
devoutly
as
follows
the
ultimate
and
true
explanation
of
the
inner
being
of
the
entirety
of
things
must
of
necessity
be
closely
connected
with
that
about
the
ethical
significance
of
human
this
connection
is
not
necessary
at
all
such
a
connection
must
rather
be
rejected
by
that
principle
of
the
stern
necessity
of
human
actions
that
is
the
unconditioned
and
of
the
will
philosophic
brains
will
accordingly
be
distinguished
from
others
by
their
disbelief
in
the
metaphysical
significance
of
morality
this
must
create
between
the
two
kinds
of
brain
a
gulf
of
a
depth
and
unbridgeableness
of
which
the
gulf
between
cultured
and
uncultured
scarcely
gives
a
conception
it
is
true
that
many
back
doors
which
the
philosophic
brains
like
schopenhauer
s
own
have
left
for
themselves
must
be
recognised
as
useless
none
leads
into
the
open
into
the
fresh
air
of
the
free
will
but
every
door
through
which
people
had
slipped
hitherto
showed
behind
it
once
more
the
gleaming
brass
wall
of
fate
for
we
are
in
a
prison
and
can
only
dream
of
freedom
not
make
ourselves
free
that
the
recognition
of
this
fact
can
not
be
resisted
much
longer
is
shown
by
the
despairing
and
incredible
postures
and
grimaces
of
those
who
still
press
against
it
and
continue
their
with
it
their
attitude
at
present
is
something
like
this
so
no
one
is
responsible
for
his
actions
and
all
is
full
of
guilt
and
the
consciousness
of
guilt
but
some
one
be
the
sinner
if
it
is
no
longer
possible
or
permissible
to
accuse
and
sentence
the
individual
the
one
poor
wave
in
the
inevitable
of
the
waves
of

let
this
stormy
sea

be

here

this
totality

be
accused
and

can
atone
and

be
the

and

the
world
s

be

and
let

the
judge
his
own
this
christianity
strained
to
its
what
else
is
it
the
last
thrust
in
the
between
the
teaching
of
unconditioned
morality
and
the
teaching
of
unconditioned
it
would
be
quite
horrible
if
it
were
anything
more
than
a
logical
pose
a
hideous
grimace
of
the
underlying
thought
perhaps
the
of
the
heart
that
seeks
a
remedy
in
its
despair
the
heart
to
which
delirium
whispers
behold
thou
art
the
lamb
which
taketh
away
the
sin
of
this
error
lies
not
only
in
the
feeling
i
am
responsible
but
just
as
much
in
the
contradiction
i
am
not
responsible
but
some
one
must
that
is
simply
not
true
hence
the
philosopher
must
say
like
christ
judge
not
and
the
final
distinction
between
the
philosophic
brains
and
the
others
would
be
that
the
former
wish
to
be
just
and
the
latter
wish
to
be
judges
hold
that
sacrifice
is
the
hallmark
of
moral
action
consider
whether
in
every
action
that
is
done
with
deliberation
in
the
best
as
in
the
worst
there
be
not
a
sacrifice
against
the
triers
of
the
reins
of
must
know
the
best
and
the
worst
that
a
man
is
capable
of
in
theory
and
in
practice
before
one
can
judge
how
strong
his
moral
nature
is
and
can
be
but
this
is
an
experiment
that
one
can
never
carry
out

we
have
a
serpent

tooth
or
not
we
can
not
know
before
some
one
has
set
his

upon
our
necks
a

or
a

could
say
until
some
one
has
put
his
heel
upon
the
neck
of
our
darling
our
character
is
determined
more
by
the
absence
of
certain

than
by
the
experiences
we
have
undergone

you
who

so
much
of
in
love
of
the
absorption
of
the
ego
in
the
other
person
hold
that
this
is
something
different
so
you
break
the
mirror
throw
yourselves
into
another
personality
that
you
admire
and
enjoy
the
new
portrait
of
your
ego
though
calling
it
by
the
other
person

this
whole
proceeding
is
not

be

you
marvellous
beings
seems
to
me
that
those
who
hide
something
of
themselves
from
themselves
or
hide
their
whole
selves
from
themselves
are
alike
committing
a
theft
from
the
treasury
of
knowledge
it
is
clear
then
against
what
transgression
the
maxim
know

is
a
warning
to
the
denier
of
his
who
denies
his
own
vanity
usually
possesses
it
in
so
brutal
a
form
that
he
instinctively
shuts
his
eyes
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
despising
himself
why
the
stupid
so
often
become
those
arguments
of
our
adversary
against
which
our
head
feels
too
weak
our
heart
replies
by
throwing
suspicion
on
the
motives
of
his
arguments
the
art
of
moral
art
that
points
out
and
glorifies
the
exceptional
cases
of
the
good
becomes
bad
and
the
unjust
rarely
be
given
a
hearing
just
as
now
and
again
we
buy
something
from
gipsies
with
the
fear
that
they
are
diverting
to
their
own
pockets
much
more
than
their
mere
profit
from
the
purchase
enjoyment
and
of
only
decisive
argument
that
has
always
deterred
men
from
drinking
a
poison
is
not
that
it
is
deadly
but
that
it
has
an
unpleasant
taste
the
world
without
consciousness
of
men
only
committed
such
deeds
as
do
not
give
rise
to
a
bad
conscience
the
human
world
would
still
look
bad
and
rascally
enough
but
not
so
sickly
and
pitiable
as
at
wicked
men
without
conscience
have
existed
at
all
times
and
many
good
honest
folk
lack
the
feeling
of
pleasure
in
a
good
conscience
the
is
more
convenient
to
follow
one
s
conscience
than
one
s
intelligence
for
at
every
failure
conscience
finds
an
excuse
and
an
encouragement
in
itself
that
is
why
there
are
so
many
conscientious
and
so
few
intelligent
people
opposite
means
of
avoiding
temperament
finds
it
useful
to
be
able
to
give
vent
to
its
disgust
in
words
being
made
sweeter
by
speech
another
reaches
its
full
bitterness
only
by
speaking
out
it
is
more
advisable
for
it
to
have
to
gulp
down
restraint
that
men
of
this
stamp
place
upon
themselves
in
the
presence
of
enemies
and
superiors
improves
their
character
and
prevents
it
from
becoming
too
acrid
and
sour
not
to
be
too
get
is
unpleasant
but
no
proof
against
the
merits
of
the
cure
that
prescribes
that
you
should
take
to
your
bed
men
who
have
long
lived
outside
themselves
and
have
at
last
devoted
themselves
to
the
inward
philosophic
life
know
that
one
can
also
get
sores
of
character
and
intellect
this
again
is
on
the
whole
no
argument
against
the
chosen
way
of
life
but
necessitates
a
few
small
exceptions
and
apparent
relapses
the
human
thing
in
most
vulnerable
and
yet
most
unconquerable
of
things
is
human
vanity
nay
through
being
wounded
its
strength
increases
and
can
grow
to
giant
proportions
the
farce
of
many
industrious
an
excess
of
effort
they
win
leisure
for
themselves
and
then
they
can
do
nothing
with
it
but
count
the
hours
until
the
tale
is
ended
the
possession
of
joy
that
has
joy
abounding
must
be
a
good
man
but
perhaps
he
is
not
the
cleverest
of
men
although
he
has
reached
the
very
goal
towards
which
the
cleverest
man
is
striving
with
all
his
cleverness
in
the
mirror
of
not
a
man
fairly
well
described
when
we
are
told
that
he
likes
to
walk
between
tall
fields
of
golden
corn
that
he
prefers
the
forest
and
flower
colours
of
sere
and
chilly
autumn
to
all
others
because
they
point
to
something
more
beautiful
than
nature
has
ever
attained
that
he
feels
as
much
at
home
under
big
walnut
trees
as
among
his
nearest
kinsfolk
that
in
the
mountains
his
greatest
joy
is
to
come
across
those
tiny
distant
lakes
from
which
the
very
eyes
of
solitude
seem
to
peer
at
him
that
he
loves
that
grey
calm
of
the
misty
twilight
that
steals
along
the
windows
on
autumn
and
early
winter
evenings
and
shuts
out
all
soulless
sounds
as
with
velvet
curtains
that
in
unhewn
stones
he
recognises
the
last
remaining
traces
of
the
primeval
age
eager
for
speech
and
honours
them
from
childhood
upwards
that
lastly
the
sea
with
its
shifting
serpent
skin
and
beauty
is
and
remains
to
him
unfamiliar
something
of
the
man
is
described
herewith
but
the
mirror
of
nature
does
not
say
that
the
same
man
with
and
not
even
in
spite
of
all
his
idyllic
sensibilities
might
be
disagreeable
stingy
and
conceited
horace
who
was
a
good
judge
of
such
matters
in
his
famous
ille
qui
procul
puts
the
tenderest
feeling
for
country
life
into
the
mouth
of
a
roman
power
without
strongest
cognition
that
of
the
complete
of
the
human
will
is
yet
the
poorest
in
results
for
it
has
always
had
the
mightiest
of
vanity
pleasure
and
beneficial
influence
on
friends
is
exerted
by
one
man
unconsciously
through
his
nature
by
another
consciously
through
isolated
actions
although
the
former
nature
is
held
to
be
the
higher
the
latter
alone
is
allied
to
good
conscience
and
pleasure
in
justification
by
good
works
which
rests
upon
a
belief
in
the
volitional
character
of
our
good
and
evil
is
to
say
upon
a
mistake
the
folly
of
committing
injustice
we
have
inflicted
ourselves
is
far
harder
to
bear
than
the
injustice
inflicted
upon
us
by
others
not
always
from
moral
grounds
be
it
observed
after
all
the
doer
is
always
the
is
if
he
be
capable
of
feeling
the
sting
of
conscience
or
of
perceiving
that
by
his
action
he
has
armed
society
against
himself
and
cut
himself
off
for
this
reason
we
should
beware
still
more
of
doing
than
of
suffering

our
feeling
of

from
any
consideration
of
the

of

and
morality
for
in
suffering
injustice
we
have
the
consolation
of
a
good
conscience
of
hope
and
of

to
cackle
when
the
envied
hen
has
laid
an
egg
thereby
relieving
itself
and
becoming
milder
but
there
is
a
yet
deeper
envy
that
in
such
a
case
becomes
dead
silent
desiring
that
every
mouth
should
be
sealed
and
always
more
and
more
angry
because
this

is
not
gratified
silent
envy
grows
in
silence
anger
as
a
exhausts
the
soul
and
brings
its
very
dregs
to

hence
if
we
know
no
other
means
of
gaining
certainty
we
must
understand
how
to
arouse
anger
in
our
dependents
and
adversaries

of

does
not
lie
in
attacking
opinions
and
continuing
to
love
their
propounders
but
in
the
far
harder
task
of
defending
his
own
position
without
causing
or
intending
to
cause
bitter
heartburns
to
his

the

of

runs

to

by
being
rather
conceited
about
this
honesty

generally

perhaps
one

he
will
confess
that
the

did
him
a

service
by
thrusting
forward
and
bringing
to

the
hidden
disease
of
his
opinions
alter
not
at
all

very
little
the
character
of
a

they
illuminate
individual
facets
of
his

hitherto

of

had
remained
dark
and
unrecognisable
simulated

when
we
wish
to
show
ourselves
superior
to
the

but
generally
in

this
point
is
not
noticed
without
a
considerable
enhancement
of
that
feeling
of
animosity

contradiction

the
moment
when
a
man
openly
makes
known
his
difference
of
opinion
from
a

the
whole

thinks
that
he
must
be
angry
with
the
latter
sometimes
however
he
is
just
on
the
point
of
ceasing
to
be
angry
with
him
he
ventures
to
put
himself
on
the
same
plane
as
his

is
free
from
the
tortures
of
suppressed
envy
seeing

the
darkest
hour
of

and
guilt
we
are
still
glad
to
see
others
taking
a
light
from
us
and
making
use
of
us
as
of
the
disk
of
the
moon
by
this
roundabout
route
we
derive
some
light
from

but
to
picture
to
oneself
the

and
to
rejoice
thereat
is
the
highest
privilege
of
the
highest
animals
and
again
amongst
them
is
the
property
only
of
the

hence
there

the

is
ashamed
of
the
all
coolness
we
make
reasonable

against

we
make
the
most
serious
mistake
in
this
connection
in
being
often
ashamed
when
the
design
has
to
be
carried
out
of
the
coolness
and
calculation
with
which
we
conceived

so
we
do
just
the
unreasonable
thing
from
that
sort
of
defiant
magnanimity
that
every
passion
involves
why
the
sceptics
offend
who
takes
his
morality
solemnly
and
seriously
is
enraged
against
the
sceptics
in
the
domain
of
morals
for
where
he
lavishes
all
his
force
he
wishes
others
to
marvel
but
not
to
investigate
and
doubt
then
there
are
natures
whose
last
shred
of
morality
is
just
the
belief
in
morals
they
behave
in
the
same
way
towards
sceptics
if
possible
still
more
passionately
moralists
are
shy
because
they
know
they
are
confounded
with
spies
and
traitors
so
soon
as
their
penchant
is
noticed
besides
they
are
generally
conscious
of
being
impotent
in
action
for
in
the
midst
of
work
the
motives
of
their
activity
almost
withdraw
their
attention
from
the
work
a
danger
to
universal
who
are
at
the
same
time
noble
and
honest
come
to
deify
every
devilry
that
brings
out
their
honesty
and
to
suspend
for
a
time
the
balance
of
their
moral
judgment
the
saddest
is
an
unpardonable
offence
when
one
discovers
that
where
one
was
convinced
of
being
loved
one
is
only
regarded
as
a
household
utensil
and
decoration
whereby
the
master
of
the
house
can
find
an
outlet
for
his
vanity
before
his
guests
love
and
else
is
love
but
understanding
and
rejoicing
that
another
lives
works
and
feels
in
a
different
and
opposite
way
to
ourselves
that
love
may
be
able
to
bridge
over
the
contrasts
by
joys
we
must
not
remove
or
deny
those
contrasts
even
presupposes
an
irreconcileable
duality
or
plurality

person

sometimes
does
not

and

in
waking
one
has
a
good
or
a
bad
conscience
as
regards
some
revealed
completely
and
unambiguously
by
dreams
joy
but
joylessness
is
the
mother
of
debauchery
reward
and
one
accuses
without
an
underlying
notion
of
punishment
and
revenge
even
when
he
accuses
his
fate
or
himself
all
complaint
is
accusation
all
is
praise
whether
we
do
one
or
the
other
we
always
make
some
one
responsible
doubly
sometimes
advance
truth
by
a
twofold
injustice
when
we
see
and
represent
consecutively
the
two
sides
of
a
case
which
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
see
together
but
in
such
a
way
that
every
time
we
mistake
or
deny
the
other
side

that
what
we
see
is
the
whole

not
always

a
slow

path
to
vice
and
rascality
of
every
description
in
the

the
traveller
is
quite
abandoned
by
the
of
a
bad
conscience
and
although
a
thorough
scoundrel
he
walks
in
innocence
making
plans
and
conceiving
projects
involves
many
agreeable
sentiments
he
that
had
the
strength
to
be
nothing
but
a
contriver
of
plans
all
his
life
would
be
a
happy
man
but
one
must
occasionally
have
a
rest
from
this
activity
by
carrying
a
plan
into
execution
and
then
comes
anger
and
sobriety
wherewith
we
see
the
efficient
man
is
blocked
by
his
efficiency
and
can
not
look
out
freely
from
its
prison

he
not
also
a
goodly
share
of
imperfection
he
could
by
reason
of
his
virtue
never
arrive
at
an
intellectual
or
moral
freedom
our
shortcomings
are
the
eyes
with
which
we
see
the
ideal
dishonest
praise
causes
many
more
twinges
of
conscience
than
dishonest
blame
probably
only
because
we
have
exposed
our
capacity
for
judgment
far
more
completely
through
excessive
praise
than
through
excessive
and
unjust
blame
how
one
dies
is
whole
way
in
which
a
man
thinks
of
death
during
the
prime
of
his
life
and
strength
is
very
expressive
and
significant
for
what
we
call
his
character
but
the
hour
of
death
itself
his
behaviour
on
the
is
almost
indifferent
the
exhaustion
of
waning
life

when
old
people
die

irregular
or
insufficient
nourishment
of
the
brain
during
this
last
period
the
occasionally
violent
pain
the
novel
and
untried
nature
of
the
whole
position
and
only
too
often
the
ebb
and
flow
of
superstitious
impressions
and
fears
as
if
dying
were
of
much
consequence
and
meant
the
crossing
of
bridges
of
the
most
terrible
this
forbids
our
using
death
as
a
testimony
concerning
the
living
nor
is
it
true
that
the
dying
man
is
generally
more
honest
than
the
living
on
the
contrary
through
the
solemn
attitude
of
the
bystanders
the
repressed
or
flowing
streams
of
tears
and
emotions
every
one
is
inveigled
into
a
comedy
of
vanity
now
conscious
now
unconscious
the
serious
way
in
which
every
dying
man
is
treated
must
have
been
to
many
a
poor
despised
devil

highest
joy
of
his
whole
life

a
sort
of
compensation
and
repayment
for
many
privations
morality
and
its
origin
of
morality
may
be
traced
to
two
ideas
the
community
is
of
more
value
than
the
individual
and
the
permanent
interest
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
the
conclusion
drawn
is
that
the
permanent
interest
of
the
community
is
unconditionally
to
be
set
above
the
temporary
interest
of
the
individual
especially
his
momentary
but
also
his
permanent
interest
and
even
the
prolongation
of
his
existence
even
if
the
individual
suffers
by
an
arrangement
that
suits
the
mass
even
if
he
is
depressed
and
ruined
by
it
morality
must
be
maintained
and
the
victim
brought
to
the
sacrifice
such
a
trend
of
thought
arises
however
only
in
those
who
are
the
in
the
victim
s
case
it
enforces
the
claim
that
the
individual
might
be
worth
more
than
the
many
and
that
the
present
enjoyment
the
moment
in
paradise
should
perhaps
be
rated
higher
than
a
tame
succession
of
untroubled
or
comfortable
circumstances
but
the
philosophy
of
the
sacrificial
victim
always
finds
voice
too
late
and
so
victory
remains
with
morals
and
morality
which
are
really
nothing
more
than
the
sentiment
for
the
whole
concept
of
morals
under
which
one
lives
and
has
been
reared
not
as
an
individual
but
as
a
member
of
the
whole
as
a
cipher
in
a
majority
hence
it
constantly
happens
that
the
individual
makes
himself
into
a
majority
by
means
of
his
morality

good

the
good
hold
that
all
good
things

at
all
times

a
good

which
is
certainly
a
very
good
thing
has
come
into
the

quite
free
from
all
pathos
rather
clandestinely
by
roundabout
ways

with
shrouded

that

the

a
real
love
unalloyed
happiness
so
long
as
it
is
genuinely
believed
as
to
the
reason
of
this
psychologist
and
christian
might
well
differ
hence
earthly
life
through
the
belief
i
mean
the
fancy
that
it
satisfies
not
only
the
injunction
to
love
our
enemies
but
all
the
other
injunctions
of
christianity
and
that
it
has
really
assimilated
and
embodied
in
itself
the
divine
perfection
according
to
the
command
be
perfect
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
might
actually
become
a
holy
life
thus
error
can
make
christ
s
promise
come
true
of
the
future
of
may
be
allowed
to
form
a
conjecture
as
to
the
disappearance
of
christianity
and
as
to
the
places
where
it
will
be
the
slowest
to
retreat
if
we
consider
where
and
for
what
reasons
protestantism
spread
with
such
startling
rapidity
as
is
well
known
protestantism
promised
to
do
far
more
cheaply
all
that
the
old
church
did
without
costly
masses
pilgrimages
and
priestly
pomp
and
circumstance
it
spread
particularly
among
the
northern
nations
which
were
not
so
deeply
rooted
as
those
of
the
south
in
the
old
church
s
symbolism
and
love
of
ritual
in
the
south
the
more
powerful
pagan
religion
survived
in
christianity
whereas
in
the
north
christianity
meant
an
opposition
to
and
a
break
with
the
creed
and
hence
was
from
the
first
more
thoughtful
and
less
sensual
but
for
that
very
reason
in
times
of
peril
more
fanatical
and
more
obstinate
if
from
the
standpoint
of
we
succeed
in
uprooting
christianity
we
can
at
once
know
the
point
where
it
will
begin
to
very
point
at
which
it
will
be
most
stubborn
in
defence
in
other
places
it
will
bend
but
not
break
lose
its
leaves
but
burst
into
leaf
afresh
because
the
senses
and
not
thought
have
gone
over
to
its
side
but
it
is
the
senses
that
maintain
the
belief
that
with
all
its
expensive
outlay
the
church
is
more
cheaply
and
conveniently
managed
than
under
the
stern
conditions
of
work
and
wages
yet
what
does
one
hold
leisure
or
to
be
worth
when
once
one
has
become
accustomed
to
it
the
senses
plead
against
a
dechristianised
world
saying
that
there
would
be
too
much
work
to
do
in
it
and
an
insufficient
supply
of
leisure
they
take
the
part
of
is
they
let

work
himself

theatricality
and
honesty
of
is
no
book
that
contains
in
such
abundance
or
expresses
so
faithfully
all
that
man
occasionally
finds
inward
happiness
ready
for
sacrifice
or
death
in
the
belief
in
and
contemplation
of
the
book
that
tells
of
christ
from
that
book
a
clever
man
may
learn
all
the
means
whereby
a
book
can
be
made
into
a
a
for
all
and
especially
that
of
representing
everything
as
discovered
nothing
as
future
and
uncertain
all
influential
books
try
to
leave
the
same
impression
as
if
the
widest
intellectual
horizon
were
circumscribed
here
and
as
if
about
the
sun
that
shines
here
every
constellation
visible
at
present
or
in
the
future
must
not
then
all
purely
scientific
books
be
poor
in
influence
on
the
same
grounds
as
such
books
are
rich
in
influence
is
not
the
book
fated
to
live
humble
and
among
humble
folk
in
order
to
be
crucified
in
the
end
and
never
resurrected
in
relation
to
what
the
religious
inform
us
of
their
knowledge
and
their
holy
spirit
are
not
all
upright
men
of
science
poor
in
spirit
can
any
religion
demand
more
and
draw
the
selfish
out
of
themselves
more
inexorably
than
science
and
similar
things
we
may
say
in
any
case
with
a
certain
theatricality
when
we
have
to
defend
ourselves
against
believers
for
it
is
impossible
to
conduct
a
defence
without
a
certain
amount
of
theatricality
but
between
ourselves
our
language
must
be
more
honest
and
we
employ
a
freedom
that
those
believers
are
not
even
allowed
in
their
own
interests
to
understand
away
then
with
the
monastic
cowl
of
with
the
appearance
of
humility
much
more
and
much
rings
our
truth
if
science
were
not
linked
with
the
pleasure
of
knowledge
the
utility
of
the
thing
known
what
should
we
care
for
science
if
a
little
faith
love
and
hope
did
not
lead
our
souls
to
knowledge
what
would
attract
us
to
science
and
if
in
science
the
ego
means
nothing
still
the
inventive
happy
ego
every
upright
and
industrious
ego
means
a
great
deal
in
the
republic
of
the
men
of
science
the
homage
of
those
who
pay
homage
the
joy
of
those
whom
we
wish
well
or
honour
in
some
cases
glory
and
a
fair
share
of
immortality
is
the
personal
reward
for
every
suppression
of
personality
to
say
nothing
here
of
meaner
views
and
rewards
although
it
is
just
on
this
account
that
the
majority
have
sworn
and
always
continue
to
swear
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
republic
and
of
science
if
we
had
not
remained
in
some
degree
unscientific
what
would
science
matter
to
us
taking
everything
together
and
speaking
in
plain
language
to
a
purely
knowing
being
knowledge
would
be
the
quality
but
the
quantity
of
faith
and
devoutness
distinguishes
us
from
the
pious
the
believers
we
are
content
with
less
but
should
one
of
them
cry
out
to
us
be
content
and
show
yourselves
contented
we
could
easily
answer
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
not
belong
to
the
most
discontented
class
but
you
if
your
faith
makes
you
happy
show
yourselves
to
be
happy
your
faces
have
always
done
more
harm
to
your
faith
than
our
reasons
if
that
glad
message
of
your
bible
were
written
in
your
faces
you
would
not
need
to
demand
belief
in
the
authority
of
that
book
in
such
fashion
your
words
your
actions
should
continually
make
the
bible
fact
through
you
a
new
bible
should
continually
come
into
being
as
it
is
your
apologia
for
christianity
is
rooted
in
your
unchristianity
and
with
your
defence
you
write
your
own
condemnation
if
you
however
should
wish
to
emerge
from
your
dissatisfaction
with
christianity
you
should
ponder
over
the
experience
of
two
thousand
years
which
clothed
in
the
modest
form
of
a
question
may
be
voiced
as
follows
if
christ
really
intended
to
redeem
the
world
may
he
not
be
said
to
have
failed
the
poet
as
guide
to
the
the
surplus
poetical
force
that
still
exists
in
modern
humanity
but
is
not
used
under
our
conditions
of
life
should
without
any
deduction
be
devoted
to
a
definite
to
depicting
the
present
nor
to
reviving
and
summarising
the
past
but
to
pointing
the
way
to
the
future
nor
should
this
be
so
done
as
if
the
poet
like
an
imaginative
political
economist
had
to
anticipate
a
more
favourable
national
and
social
state
of
things
and
picture
their
realisation
rather
will
he
just
as
the
earlier
poets
portrayed
the
images
of
the
gods
portray
the
fair
images
of
men
he
will
divine
those
cases
where
in
the
midst
of
our
modern
world
and
reality
which
will
not
be
shirked
or
repudiated
in
the
usual
poetic
fashion
a
great
noble
soul
is
still
possible
where
it
may
be
embodied
in
harmonious
equable
conditions
where
it
may
become
permanent
visible
and
representative
of
a
type
and
so
by
the
stimulus
to
imitation
and
envy
help
to
create
the
future
the
poems
of
such
a
poet
would
be
distinguished
by
appearing
secluded
and
protected
from
the
heated
atmosphere
of
the
passions
the
irremediable
failure
the
shattering
of
all
the
strings
of
the
human
instrument
the
scornful
laughter
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
all
tragedy
and
comedy
in
the
usual
old
sense
would
appear
by
the
side
of
this
new
art
as
mere
archaic
lumber
a
blurring
of
the
outlines
of
the
strength
kindness
gentleness
purity
and
an
unsought
innate
moderation
in
the
personalities
and
their
action
a
levelled
soil
giving
rest
and
pleasure
to
the
foot
a
shining
heaven
mirrored
in
faces
and
events
science
and
art
welded
into
a
new
unity
the
mind
living
together
with
her
sister
the
soul
without
arrogance
or
jealousy
and
enticing
from
contrasts
the
grace
of
seriousness
not
the
impatience
of
this
would
be
the
general
environment
the
background
on
which
the
delicate
differences
of
the
embodied
ideals
would
make
the
real
picture
that
of
human
majesty
many
roads
to
this
poetry
of
the
future
start
from
goethe
but
the
quest
needs
good
pathfinders
and
above
all
a
far
greater
strength
than
is
possessed
by
modern
poets
who
unscrupulously
represent
the
and
the
immaturity
and
intemperance
that
are
mistaken
by
them
for
power
and
naturalness
the
muse
as
penthesilea
better
to
rot
than
to
be
a
woman
without
when
once
the
muse
thinks
thus
the
end
of
her
art
is
again
at
hand
but
it
can
be
a
tragic
and
also
a
comic
finale
the
circuitous
path
to
the
the
beautiful
is
to
be
identified
with
that
which
gives
thus
sang
the
muses
useful
is
often
the
necessary
circuitous
path
to
the
beautiful
and
has
a
perfect
right
to
spurn
the
censure
of
men
who
live
for
the
moment
who
will
not
wait
and
who
think
that
they
can
reach
all
good
things
without
ever
taking
a
circuitous
path
an
excuse
for
many
a
ceaseless
desire
to
create
the
eternal
looking
outward
of
the
artist
hinders
him
from
becoming
better
and
more
beautiful
as
a
personality
unless
his
craving
for
glory
be
great
enough
to
compel
him
to
exhibit
in
his
relations
with
other
men
a
growth
corresponding
to
the
growing
beauty
and
greatness
of
his
works
in
any
case
he
has
but
a
limited
measure
of
strength
and
how
could
the
proportion
of
strength
that
he
spends
on
himself
be
of
any
benefit
to
his
satisfying
the
best
we
have
satisfied
the
best
people
of
our
time
with
our
art
it
is
a
sign
that
we
shall
not
satisfy
the
best
people
of
the
succeeding
period
we
have
indeed
lived
for
all
time
and
the
applause
of
the
best
people
ensures
our
fame
of
one
we
are
of
one
substance
with
a
book
or
a
work
of
art
we
think
in
our
heart
of
hearts
that
it
must
be
excellent
and
are
offended
if
others
find
it
ugly
or
pretentious
speech
and
speech
is
not
given
to
us
to
communicate
our
emotions
may
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
all
simple
men
are
ashamed
to
seek
for
words
to
express
their
deeper
feelings
these
feelings
are
expressed
only
in
actions
and
even
here
such
men
blush
if
others
seem
to
divine
their
motives
after
all
among
poets
to
whom
god
generally
denies
this
shame
the
more
noble
are
more
monosyllabic
in
the
language
of
emotion
and
evince
a
certain
constraint
whereas
the
real
poets
of
emotion
are
for
the
most
part
shameless
in
practical
life
a
mistake
about
a
that
has
not
for
a
long
time
been
completely
weaned
from
an
art
and
is
still
always
at
home
in
it
has
no
idea
how
small
a
privation
it
is
to
live
without
that
art
work
that
is
meant
to
give
an
impression
of
health
should
be
produced
with
at
the
most
of
the
strength
of
its
creator
if
he
has
gone
to
his
farthest
limit
the
work
excites
the
observer
and
disconcerts
him
by
its
tension
all
good
things
have
something
lazy
about
them
and
lie
like
cows
in
the
meadow
refusing
to
have
hunger
as
a
refined
fare
serves
a
hungry
man
as
well
as
and
no
better
than
coarser
food
the
more
pretentious
artist
will
not
dream
of
inviting
the
hungry
man
to
his
meal
living
without
art
and
is
with
works
of
art
as
with
is
better
if
one
can
do
without
both
and
keep
to
water
and
if
from
the
inner
fire
and
inner
sweetness
of
the
soul
the
water
spontaneously
changes
again
into
wine
the
in
art
who
even
knows
how
to
deceive
subtle
minds
arises
when
some
one
unscrupulously
and
from
youth
upwards
regards
all
good
things
that
are
not
protected
by
law
as
the
property
of
a
particular
person
as
his
legitimate
spoil
now
all
the
good
things
of
past
ages
and
masters
lie
free
around
us
hedged
about
and
protected
by
the
reverential
awe
of
the
few
who
know
them
to
these
few
our
by
the
force
of
his
impudence
bids
defiance
and
accumulates
for
himself
a
wealth
that
once
more
calls
forth
homage
and
awe
to
the
poets
of
great
the
gardens
of
modern
poetry
it
will
clearly
be
observed
that
the
sewers
of
great
towns
are
too
near
with
the
fragrance
of
flowers
is
mingled
something
that
betrays
abomination
and
putrescence
with
pain
i
ask
must
you
poets
always
request
wit
and
dirt
to
stand
godfather
when
an
innocent
and
beautiful
sensation
has
to
be
christened
by
you
are
you
obliged
to
dress
your
noble
goddess
in
a
hood
of
devilry
and
caricature
but
whence
this
necessity
this
obligation
the
reason
you
live
too
near
the
sewers
of
the
salt
of
one
has
ever
explained
why
the
greek
writers
having
at
command
such
an
unparalleled
wealth
and
power
of
language
made
so
sparing
a
use
of
their
resources
that
every
greek
book
appears
by
comparison
crude
and
extravagant
it
is
said
that
towards
the
north
polar
ice
and
in
the
hottest
countries
salt
is
becoming
less
and
less
used
whereas
on
the
other
hand
the
dwellers
on
the
plains
and
by
the
coast
in
the
more
temperate
zones
use
salt
in
great
abundance
is
it
possible
that
the
greeks
from
a
twofold
their
intellect
was
colder
and
clearer
but
their
fundamental
passionate
nature
far
more
tropical
than
not
need
salt
and
spice
to
the
same
extent
that
we
do
the
freest
a
book
for
free
spirits
one
can
not
avoid
mention
of
laurence
sterne
the
man
whom
goethe
honoured
as
the
freest
spirit
of
his
century
may
he
be
satisfied
with
the
honour
of
being
called
the
freest
writer
of
all
times
in
comparison
with
whom
all
others
appear
stiff
intolerant
and
downright
boorish
in
his
case
we
should
not
speak
of
the
clear
and
rounded
but
of
the
endless
melody
by
this
phrase
we
arrive
at
a
name
for
an
artistic
style
in
which
the
definite
form
is
continually
broken
thrust
aside
and
transferred
to
the
realm
of
the
indefinite
so
that
it
signifies
one
and
the
other
at
the
same
time
sterne
is
the
great
master
of
this
phrase
being
naturally
used
in
a
far
wider
sense
than
is
commonly
done
when
one
applies
it
to
sexual
relations
we
may
give
up
for
lost
the
reader
who
always
wants
to
know
exactly
what
sterne
thinks
about
a
matter
and
whether
he
be
making
a
serious
or
a
smiling
face
for
he
can
do
both
with
one
wrinkling
of
his
features
he
can
be
and
even
wishes
to
be
right
and
wrong
at
the
same
moment
to
interweave
profundity
and
farce
his
digressions
are
at
once
continuations
and
further
developments
of
the
story
his
maxims
contain
a
satire
on
all
that
is
sententious
his
dislike
of
seriousness
is
bound
up
with
a
disposition
to
take
no
matter
merely
externally
and
on
the
surface
so
in
the
proper
reader
he
arouses
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
whether
he
be
walking
lying
or
standing
a
feeling
most
closely
akin
to
that
of
floating
in
the
air
he
the
most
versatile
of
writers
communicates
something
of
this
versatility
to
his
reader
yes
sterne
unexpectedly
changes
the
parts
and
is
often
as
much
reader
as
author
his
book
being
like
a
play
within
a
play
a
theatre
audience
before
another
theatre
audience
we
must
surrender
at
discretion
to
the
mood
of
sterne
although
we
can
always
expect
it
to
be
gracious
it
is
strangely
instructive
to
see
how
so
great
a
writer
as
diderot
has
affected
this
of
sterne
be
equally
ambiguous
throughout
is
just
the
sternian
did
diderot
imitate
admire
ridicule
or
parody
sterne
in
his
le
one
can
not
be
exactly
certain
and
this
uncertainty
was
perhaps
intended
by
the
author
this
very
doubt
makes
the
french
unjust
to
the
work
of
one
of
their
first
masters
one
who
need
not
be
ashamed
of
comparison
with
any
of
the
ancients
or
moderns
for
humour
and
especially
for
this
humorous
attitude
towards
humour
itself
the
french
are
too
serious
is
it
necessary
to
add
that
of
all
great
authors
sterne
is
the
worst
model
in
fact
the
inimitable
author
and
that
even
diderot
had
to
pay
for
his
daring
what
the
worthy
frenchmen
and
before
them
some
greeks
and
romans
aimed
at
and
attained
in
prose
is
the
very
opposite
of
what
sterne
aims
at
and
attains
he
raises
himself
as
a
masterly
exception
above
all
that
artists
in
writing
demand
of
reserve
character
steadfastness
of
purpose
comprehensiveness
perspicuity
good
deportment
in
gait
and
feature
unfortunately
sterne
the
man
seems
to
have
been
only
too
closely
related
to
sterne
the
writer
his
sprang
with
insatiable
unrest
from
branch
to
branch
he
knew
what
lies
between
sublimity
and
rascality
he
had
sat
on
every
seat
always
with
unabashed
watery
eyes
and
mobile
play
of
feature
he
language
does
not
revolt
from
such
a
a
kindness
and
in
the
midst
of
the
joys
of
a
grotesque
and
even
corrupt
imagination
he
showed
the
bashful
grace
of
innocence
such
a
carnal
and
spiritual
hermaphroditism
such
untrammelled
wit
penetrating
into
every
vein
and
muscle
was
perhaps
never
possessed
by
any
other
man
a
choice
as
the
good
prose
writer
only
takes
words
that
belong
to
the
language
of
daily
intercourse
though
not
by
a
long
way
all
its
arises
a
choice
the
good
poet
of
the
future
will
only
represent
the
real
and
turn
his
eyes
away
from
all
fantastic
superstitious
forgotten
stories
to
which
earlier
poets
devoted
their
powers
only

though
by
a
long
way
not
every
a
choice
reality
degenerate
species
of
by
side
with
the
genuine
species
of
art
those
of
great
repose
and
great
movement
there
are
degenerate
blasé
art
and
excited
art
both
would
have
their
weakness
taken
for
strength
and
wish
to
be
confounded
with
the
genuine
species
a
hero
impossible
from
lack
of
typical
poets
and
artists
of
our
age
like
to
compose
their
pictures
upon
a
background
of
shimmering
red
green
grey
and
gold
on
the
background
of
nervous
condition
well
understood
by
the
children
of
this
century
the
drawback
comes
when
we
do
look
at
these
pictures
with
the
eyes
of
our
century
then
we
see
that
the
great
figures
painted
by
these
artists
have
something
flickering
tremulous
and
dizzy
about
them
and
accordingly
we
do
not
ascribe
to
them
heroic
deeds
but
at
best
swaggering
overladen
overladen
style
is
a
consequence
of
the
impoverishment
of
the
organising
force
together
with
a
lavish
stock
of
expedients
and
intentions
at
the
beginnings
of
art
the
very
reverse
conditions
sometimes
appear
est
paucorum
and
experience
tell
us
that
the
significant
grotesqueness
that
mysteriously
excites
the
imagination
and
carries
one
beyond
everyday
reality
is
older
and
grows
more
luxuriantly
than
the
beautiful
and
reverence
for
the
beautiful
in
art
and
that
it
begins
to
flourish
exceedingly
when
the
sense
for
beauty
is
on
the
wane
for
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
this
grotesque
seems
to
be
a
higher
need
than
the
beautiful
presumably
because
it
contains
a
coarser
narcotic
origins
of
taste
in
works
of
we
consider
the
primary
germs
of
the
artistic
sense
and
ask
ourselves
what
are
the
various
kinds
of
joy
produced
by
the
firstlings
of
for
example
among
savage
find
first
of
all
the
joy
of
understanding
what
another
means
art
in
this
case
is
a
sort
of
conundrum
which
causes
its
solver
pleasure
in
his
own
quick
and
keen
the
roughest
works
of
art
remind
us
of
the
pleasant
things
we
have
actually
experienced
and
so
give
for
example
when
the
artist
alludes
to
a
chase
a
victory
a
the
representation
may
cause
us
to
feel
excited
touched
inflamed
as
for
instance
in
the
glorification
of
revenge
and
danger
here
the
enjoyment
lies
in
the
excitement
itself
in
the
victory
over
memory
too
of
unpleasant
things
so
far
as
they
have
been
overcome
or
make
us
appear
interesting
to
the
listener
as
subjects
for
art
as
when
the
singer
describes
the
mishaps
of
a
daring
seaman
can
inspire
great
joy
the
credit
for
which
is
given
to
more
subtle
variety
is
the
joy
that
arises
at
the
sight
of
all
that
is
regular
and
symmetrical
in
lines
points
and
rhythms
for
by
a
certain
analogy
is
awakened
the
feeling
for
all
that
is
orderly
and
regular
in
life
which
one
has
to
thank
alone
for
all
so
in
the
cult
of
symmetry
we
unconsciously
do
homage
to
rule
and
proportion
as
the
source
of
our
previous
happiness
and
the
joy
in
this
case
is
a
kind
of
hymn
of
thanksgiving
only
when
a
certain
satiety
of
the
joy
arises
does
a
more
subtle
feeling
step
in
that
enjoyment
might
even
lie
in
a
violation
of
the
symmetrical
and
regular
this
feeling
for
example
impels
us
to
seek
reason
in
apparent
unreason
and
the
sort
of
æsthetic
that
results
is
in
a
way
the
higher
species
of
the
artistic
who
pursues
this
speculation
still
further
will
know
what
kind
of
hypotheses
for
the
explanation
of
æsthetic
phenomena
are
hereby
fundamentally
rejected
not
too
is
a
disadvantage
for
good
thoughts
when
they
follow
too
closely
on
one
another
for
they
hide
the
view
from
each
other
that
is
why
great
artists
and
writers
have
made
an
abundant
use
of
the
mediocre
roughness
and
of
all
periods
have
made
the
discovery
that
in
roughness
lies
a
certain
strength
and
that
not
every
one
can
be
rough
who
wants
to
be
also
that
many
varieties
of
weakness
have
a
powerful
effect
on
the
emotions
from
this
source
are
derived
many
artistic
substitutes
which
not
even
the
greatest
and
most
conscientious
artists
can
abstain
from
using
good
a
man
fails
to
become
a
thinker
for
the
sole
reason
that
his
memory
is
too
good
arousing
instead
of
appeasing
artists
fancy
that
they
have
taken
full
possession
of
a
soul
in
reality
and
often
to
their
painful
disappointment
that
soul
has
only
been
made
more
capacious
and
insatiable
so
that
a
dozen
greater
artists
could
plunge
into
its
depths
without
filling
it
up
artists
anxiety
lest
people
may
not
believe
that
their
figures
are
can
mislead
many
artists
of
declining
taste
to
portray
these
figures
so
that
they
appear
as
if
mad
from
the
same
anxiety
on
the
other
hand
greek
artists
of
the
earliest
ages
gave
even
dead
and
sorely
wounded
men
that
smile
which
they
knew
as
the
most
vivid
sign
of
of
the
actual
forms
bestowed
by
nature
on
life
at
its
last
gasp
the
circle
must
be
who
follows
a
philosophy
or
a
genre
of
art
to
the
end
of
its
career
and
beyond
understands
from
inner
experience
why
the
masters
and
disciples
who
come
after
have
so
often
turned
with
a
depreciatory
gesture
into
a
new
groove
the
circle
must
be
the
individual
even
the
greatest
sits
firm
on
his
point
of
the
circumference
with
an
inexorable
look
of
obstinacy
as
if
the
circle
ought
never
to
be
completed
the
older
art
and
the
soul
of
the
every
art
becomes
more
and
more
adapted
to
the
expression
of
spiritual
states
of
the
more
lively
delicate
energetic
and
passionate
states
the
later
masters
spoilt
by
these
means
of
expression
do
not
feel
at
their
ease
in
the
presence
of
the
works
of
art
they
feel
as
if
the
ancients
had
merely
been
lacking
in
the
means
of
making
their
souls
speak
clearly
also
perhaps
in
some
necessary
technical
preliminaries
they
think
that
they
must
render
some
assistance
in
this
quarter
for
they
believe
in
the
similarity
or
even
unity
of
all
souls
in
truth
however
measure
symmetry
a
contempt
for
graciousness
and
charm
an
unconscious
severity
and
morning
chilliness
an
evasion
of
passion
as
if
passion
meant
the
death
of
are
the
constituents
of
sentiment
and
morality
in
all
old
masters
who
selected
and
arranged
their
means
of
expression
not
at
random
but
in
a
necessary
connection
with
their
morality
knowing
this
are
we
to
deny
those
that
come
after
the
right
to
animate
the
older
works
with
their
soul
no
for
these
works
can
only
survive
through
our
giving
them
our
soul
and
our
blood
alone
enables
them
to
speak
to
the
real
historic
discourse
would
talk
ghostly
speech
to
ghosts
we
honour
the
great
artists
less
by
that
barren
timidity
that
allows
every
word
every
note
to
remain
intact
than
by
energetic
endeavours
to
aid
them
continually
to
a
new
if
beethoven
were
suddenly
to
come
to
life
and
hear
one
of
his
works
performed
with
that
modern
animation
and
nervous
refinement
that
bring
glory
to
our
masters
of
execution
he
would
probably
be
silent
for
a
long
while
uncertain
whether
he
should
raise
his
hand
to
curse
or
to
bless
but
perhaps
say
at
last
well
well
that
is
neither
i
nor
but
a
third
seems
to
me
too
something
right
if
not
just
right
thing
but
you
must
know
yourselves
what
to
do
as
in
any
case
it
is
you
who
have
to
listen
as
our
schiller
says
the
living
man
is
so
have
it
your
own
way
and
let
me
go
down
against
the
disparagers
of
brief
dictum
may
be
the
fruit
and
harvest
of
long
reflection
the
reader
however
who
is
a
novice
in
this
field
and
has
never
considered
the
case
in
point
sees
something
embryonic
in
all
brief
dicta
not
without
a
reproachful
hint
to
the
author
requesting
him
not
to
serve
up
such
raw
and
food
against
the
you
think
it
is
because
it
is
and
must
be
offered
you
in
pieces
readers
of
worst
readers
of
aphorisms
are
the
friends
of
the
author
if
they
make
a
point
of
referring
the
general
to
the
particular
instance
to
which
the
aphorism
owes
its
origin
this
attitude
brings
all
the
author
s
trouble
to
naught
and
instead
of
a
philosophic
lesson
and
a
philosophic
frame
of
mind
they
deservedly
gain
nothing
but
the
satisfaction
of
a
vulgar
curiosity
readers
reader
offers
a
insult
to
the
author
by
praising
his
second
book
at
the
expense
of
his
first
or
and
by
expecting
the
author
to
be
grateful
to
him
on
that
account
the
exciting
element
in
the
history
of
fall
into
a
state
of
terrible
tension
when
we
follow
the
history
of
an
for
example
that
of
greek
passing
from
master
to
master
observe
their
increasing
precautions
to
obey
the
old
and
the
new
laws
and
all
these
limitations
we
see
that
the
bow
snap
and
that
the
loose
composition
with
the
wonderful
means
of
expression
smothered
and
concealed
in
this
particular
case
the
florid
style
of
asianism
was
once
necessary
and
almost
to
the
great
in
enthusiasm
for
some
object
which
you
o
great
man
introduce
into
this
world
causes
the
intelligence
of
the
many
to
be
stunted
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
spells
humiliation
but
the
enthusiast
wears
his
hump
with
pride
and
pleasure
and
you
have
the
consolation
of
feeling
that
you
have
increased
the
world
s
happiness
conscienceless
real
fanatics
of
an
artistic
school
are
perhaps
those
utterly
inartistic
natures
that
are
not
even
grounded
in
the
elements
of
artistic
study
and
creation
but
are
impressed
with
the
strongest
of
all
the
elementary
influences
of
an
art
for
them
there
is
no
æsthetic
nothing
to
hold
them
back
from
fanaticism
how
the
soul
should
be
moved
by
the
new
artistic
purpose
followed
by
the
new
music
in
what
is
now
forcibly
but
none
too
lucidly
termed
endless
melody
can
be
understood
by
going
into
the
sea
gradually
losing
one
s
firm
tread
on
the
bottom
and
finally
surrendering
unconditionally
to
the
fluid
element
one
has
to
in
the
previous
older
music
one
was
forced
with
delicate
or
stately
or
impassioned
movement
to
the
measure
necessary
for
dancing
the
observance
of
a
distinct
balance
of
time
and
force
in
the
soul
of
the
hearer
imposed
a
continual
through
the
counteraction
of
the
cooler
draught
of
air
which
came
from
this
caution
and
the
warmer
breath
of
musical
enthusiasm
that
music
exercised
its
wagner
aimed
at
a
different
excitation
of
the
soul
allied
as
above
said
to
swimming
and
floating
this
is
perhaps
the
most
essential
of
his
innovations
his
famous
method
originating
from
this
aim
and
adapted
to
endless
melody
to
break
and
sometimes
even
to
despise
all
mathematical
equilibrium
of
time
and
force
he
is
only
too
rich
in
the
invention
of
such
effects
which
sound
to
the
old
school
like
rhythmic
paradoxes
and
blasphemies
he
dreads
petrifaction
crystallisation
the
development
of
music
into
the
architectural
he
accordingly
sets
up
a
rhythm
in
opposition
to
the
not
infrequently
introduces
and
immediately
repeats
a
phrase
but
with
a
prolation
so
that
its
time
is
again
doubled
and
trebled
from
an
imitation
of
such
art
may
arise
a
great
danger
to
music
for
by
the
side
of
the
superabundance
of
rhythmic
emotion
demoralisation
and
decadence
lurk
in
ambush
the
danger
will
become
very
great
if
such
music
comes
to
associate
itself
more
and
more
closely
with
a
quite
naturalistic
art
of
acting
and
pantomime
trained
and
dominated
by
no
higher
plastic
models
an
art
that
knows
no
measure
in
itself
and
can
impart
no
measure
to
the
kindred
element
the
nature
of
music
poet
and
muse
of
the
poet
who
is
not
in
love
with
reality
will
not
be
reality
and
will
bear
him
children
with
hollow
eyes
and
all
too
tender
bones

and
art
the
end
does
not
justify
the
means
but
holy
means
can
justify
the
end
the
worst
worst
readers
are
those
who
act
like
plundering
soldiers
they
take
out
some
things
that
they
might
use
cover
the
rest
with
filth
and
confusion
and
blaspheme
about
the
whole
signs
of
a
good
writers
have
two
things
in
common
they
prefer
being
understood
to
being
admired
and
they
do
not
write
for
the
critical
and
reader
the
mixed
mixed
species
in
art
bear
witness
to
their
authors
distrust
of
their
own
strength
they
seek
auxiliary
powers
advocates
is
the
case
with
the
poet
who
calls
in
philosophy
the
musician
who
calls
in
the
drama
and
the
thinker
who
calls
in
rhetoric
to
his
aid
shutting
one

his

opens
its

the
author
must
shut
his
badges

the

hence
a

that

cold

himself
with
loquacity
and
ceremoniousness
by
the
former
he
thinks
he
is
gaining
mobility
and
fluency
by
the
latter

gives
his
peculiarity
the
appearance
of
being
a
result
of
free
will
and

purpose
with
a
view
to
dignity
which

style
who
as
thinker
and
writer
is
not
born
or
trained
to
dialectic
and
the
consecutive
arrangement
of
ideas
will
unconsciously
turn
to
the
rhetoric
and
dramatic
forms
for
after
all
his
object
is
to
make
himself
understood
and
to
carry
the
day
by
force
and
he
is
indifferent
whether
as
shepherd
he
honestly
guides
to
himself
the
hearts
of
his
or
as
robber
he
captures
them
by
surprise
this
is
true
of
the
plastic
arts
as
of
music
where
the
feeling
of
insufficient
dialectic
or
a
deficiency
in
expression
or
narration
together
with
an
urgent
impulse
to
form
gives
birth
to
that
species
of
style
known
as
only

arrogant
will
at
once
find
a
depreciatory
force
in
this
word
the
baroque
style
always
arises
at
the
time
of
decay
of
a
great
art
when
the
demands
of
art
in
classical
expression
have
become
too
great
it
is
a
natural
phenomenon
which
will
be
observed

and
narration
to
this
style
belongs
already
a
choice
of
material
and
subjects
of
the
highest
dramatic
tension
at
which
the
heart
trembles
even
when
there
is
no
art
because
heaven
and
hell
are
all
too
near
the
emotions
then
the
oratory
of
strong
passion
and
gestures
of
ugly
sublimity
of
great
masses
in
fact
of
absolute
quantity
as
is
shown
in
michael
angelo
the
father
or
grandfather
of
the
italian
baroque
stylists
the
lights
of
dusk
illumination
and
conflagration
playing
upon
those
strongly
moulded
forms
ventures
in
means
and
aims
strongly
underscored
by
artists
for
artists
while
the
layman
must
fancy
he
sees
an
unconscious
overflowing
of
all
the
horns
of
plenty
of
an
original
all
these
characteristics
that
constitute
the
greatness
of
that
style
are
neither
possible
nor
permitted
in
the
earlier
and
classical
periods
of
a
branch
of
art
such
luxuries
hang
long
on
the
tree
like
forbidden
fruit
just
now
when
music
is
passing
into
this
last
phase
we
may
learn
to
know
the
phenomenon
of
the
baroque
style
in
peculiar
splendour
and
by
comparison
find
much
that
is
instructive
for
earlier
ages
for
from
greek
times
onward
there
has
often
been
a
baroque
style
in
poetry
oratory
prose
writing
sculpture
and
as
is
well
known
in
architecture
this
style
though
wanting
in
the
highest
nobility
nobility
of
an
innocent
unconscious
triumphant
perfection
nevertheless
given
pleasure
to
many
of
the
best
and
most
serious
minds
of
their
time
hence
as
aforesaid
it
is
presumptuous
to
depreciate
it
without
reserve
however
happy
we
may
feel
because
our
taste
for
it
has
not
made
us
insensible
to
the
purer
and
greater
style
the
value
of
honest
books
make
the
reader
honest
at
least
by
exciting
his
hatred
and
aversion
which
otherwise
cunning
cleverness
knows
so
well
how
to
conceal
against
a
book
however
we
let
ourselves
go
however
restrained
we
may
be
in
our
relations
with
men
how
art
makes
fine
passages
an
exciting
general
tenor
a
moving
and
absorbing
much
of
a
work
of
art
is
accessible
even
to
most
laymen
in
an
art
period
when
it
is
desired
to
win
over
the
great
majority
of
the
laymen
to
the
side
of
the
artists
and
to
make
a
party
perhaps
for
the
very
preservation
of
art
the
creative
artist
will
do
well
to
offer
nothing
more
than
the
above
then
he
will
not
be
a
squanderer
of
his
strength
in
spheres
where
no
one
is
grateful
to
him
for
to
perform
the
remaining
functions
the
imitation
of
nature
in
her
organic
development
and
growth
would
in
that
case
be
like
sowing
seeds
in
water
becoming
great
to
the
detriment
of
later
master
who
leads
the
taste
of
into
his
channel
unconsciously
gives
rise
to
a
selection
and
revaluation
of
the
older
masters
and
their
works
whatever
in
them
is
conformable
and
akin
to
him
and
anticipates
and
foreshadows
him
appears
henceforth
as
the
only
important
element
in
them
and
their
fruit
in
which
a
great
error
usually
lies
hidden
like
a
worm
how
an
epoch
becomes
lured
to
we
teach
people
by
all
the
enchantments
of
artists
and
thinkers
to
feel
reverence
for
their
defects
their
intellectual
poverty
their
absurd
infatuations
and
passions
as
it
is
quite
possible
to
do
if
we
show
them
only
the
lofty
side
of
crime
and
folly
only
the
touching
and
appealing
element
in
weakness
and
flabbiness
and
blind
devotion
that
too
has
often
enough
been
done
have
employed
the
means
for
inspiring
even
an
unphilosophical
and
inartistic
age
with
an
ecstatic
love
of
philosophy
and
art
especially
of
thinkers
and
artists
as
personalities
and
in
the
worst
case
perhaps
with
the
only
means
of
defending
the
existence
of
such
tender
and
fragile
beings
criticism
and
and
unjust
as
well
as
intelligent
criticism
gives
so
much
pleasure
to
him
who
exercises
it
that
the
world
is
indebted
to
every
work
and
every
action
that
inspires
much
criticism
and
many
critics
for
criticism
draws
after
it
a
glittering
train
of
joyousness
wit
pride
instruction
designs
of
god
of
joy
created
the
bad
and
the
mediocre
for
the
same
reason
that
he
created
the
good
beyond
his
an
artist
wants
to
be
more
than
an
example
the
moral
awakener
of
his
at
last
falls
in
love
as
a
punishment
with
a
monster
of
moral
substance
the
muse
laughs
for
though
a
goddess
she
can
also
be
malignant
from
jealousy
milton
and
klopstock
are
cases
in
point
a
glass
tendency
of
a
talent
towards
moral
subjects
characters
motives
towards
the
beautiful
soul
of
the
work
of
art
is
often
only
a
glass
eye
put
on
by
the
artist
who
lacks
a
beautiful
soul
it
may
result
though
rarely
that
his
eye
finally
becomes
living
nature
if
indeed
it
be
nature
with
a
somewhat
troubled
look
but
the
ordinary
result
is
that
the
whole
world
thinks
it
sees
nature
where
there
is
only
cold
glass
writing
and
desire
for
should
always
indicate
a
victory
indeed
a
conquest
of
oneself
which
must
be
communicated
to
others
for
their
behoof
there
are
however
dyspeptic
authors
who
only
write
when
they
can
not
digest
something
or
when
something
has
remained
stuck
in
their
teeth
through
their
anger
they
try
unconsciously
to
disgust
the
reader
too
and
to
exercise
violence
upon
is
they
desire
victory
but
victory
over
others
a
good
book
needs
good
book
tastes
bitter
when
it
first
comes
out
for
it
has
the
defect
of
newness
moreover
it
suffers
damage
from
its
living
author
if
he
is
well
known
and
much
talked
about
for
all
the
world
is
accustomed
to
confuse
the
author
with
his
work
whatever
of
profundity
sweetness
and
brilliance
the
work
may
contain
must
be
developed
as
the
years
go
by
under
the
care
of
growing
then
old
and
lastly
traditional
reverence
many
hours
must
pass
many
a
spider
must
have
woven
its
web
about
the
book
a
book
is
made
better
by
good
readers
and
clearer
by
good
opponents
extravagance
as
an
artistic
well
understand
the
idea
of
using
extravagance
as
an
artistic
means
in
order
to
convey
an
impression
of
wealth
this
is
one
of
those
innocent
wiles
of
that
the
artist
must
know
for
in
his
world
which
has
only
appearance
in
view
the
means
to
appearance
need
not
necessarily
be
genuine
the
hidden
by
virtue
of
its
more
ample
drapery
knows
better
than
talent
how
to
hide
its
yet
after
all
it
too
can
only
play
its
seven
old
pieces
over
and
over
again
the
name
on
the
is
now
a
matter
of
custom
and
almost
of
duty
for
the
author
s
name
to
appear
on
the
book
and
this
is
a
main
cause
of
the
fact
that
books
have
so
little
influence
if
they
are
good
they
are
worth
more
than
the
personalities
of
their
authors
of
which
they
are
the
quintessences
but
as
soon
as
the
author
makes
himself
known
on
the
the
quintessence
from
the
reader
s
point
of
view
becomes
diluted
with
the
personal
the
most
personal
element
and
the
aim
of
the
book
is
frustrated
it
is
the
ambition
of
the
intellect
no
longer
to
appear
individual
the
most
cutting
make
the
most
cutting
criticism
of
a
man
or
a
book
when
we
indicate
his
or
its
ideal
little
or
no
good
book
is
written
for
a
particular
reader
and
men
of
his
stamp
and
for
that
very
reason
is
looked
upon
unfavourably
by
all
other
readers
by
the
vast
majority
its
reputation
accordingly
rests
on
a
narrow
basis
and
must
be
built
up
by
mediocre
and
bad
book
is
mediocre
and
bad
because
it
seeks
to
please
and
does
please
a
great
number
music
and
danger
of
the
new
music
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
puts
the
cup
of
rapture
and
exaltation
to
the
lips
so
invitingly
and
with
such
a
show
of
moral
ecstasy
that
even
the
noble
and
temperate
man
always
drinks
a
drop
too
much
this
minimum
of
intemperance
constantly
repeated
can
in
the
end
bring
about
a
deeper
convulsion
and
destruction
of
mental
health
than
any
coarse
excess
could
do
hence
nothing
remains
but
some
day
to
fly
from
the
grotto
of
the
nymph
and
through
perils
and
billowy
seas
to
forge
one
s
way
to
the
smoke
of
ithaca
and
the
embraces
of
a
simpler
and
more
human
spouse
advantage
for

full
of
intellect
communicates
something
thereof
even
to
its
opponents
youth
and
criticise
a
book
means
for
the
young
not
to
let
oneself
be
touched
by
a
single
productive
thought
therefrom
and
to
protect
one
s
skin
with
hands
and
feet
the
youngster
lives
in
opposition
to
all
novelty
that
he
can
not
love
in
the
lump
in
a
position
of
and
in
this
connection
he
commits
as
often
as
he
can
a
superfluous
sin
effect
of
greatest
paradox
in
the
history
of
poetic
art
lies
in
this
that
in
all
that
constitutes
the
greatness
of
the
old
poets
a
man
may
be
a
barbarian
faulty
and
deformed
from
top
to
toe
and
still
remain
the
greatest
of
poets
this
is
the
case
with
shakespeare
who
as
compared
with
sophocles
is
like
a
mine
of
immeasurable
wealth
in
gold
lead
and
rubble
whereas
sophocles
is
not
merely
gold
but
gold
in
its
noblest
form
one
that
almost
makes
us
forget
the
of
the
metal
but
quantity
in
its
highest
intensity
has
the
same
effect
as
quality
that
is
a
good
thing
for
shakespeare
all
beginning
is
poet
can
choose
whether
to
raise
emotion
from
one
grade
to
another
and
so
finally
to
exalt
it
to
a
great
to
try
a
surprise
attack
and
from
the
start
to
pull
the
with
might
and
main
both
processes
have
their
the
first
case
his
hearer
may
run
away
from
him
through
boredom
in
the
second
through
terror
in
favour
of
sting
not
from
malice
but
because
they
too
want
to
live
it
is
the
same
with
our
desire
our
blood
not
our
pain
success
of
inexperienced
when
an
aphorism
at
once
illuminates
their
minds
with
its
naked
truth
always
think
that
it
is
old
and
well
known
they
look
askance
at
the
author
as
if
he
had
wanted
to
steal
the
common
property
of
all
whereas
they
enjoy
highly
spiced
and
give
the
author
to
understand
as
much
he
knows
how
to
appreciate
the
hint
and
easily
guesses
thereby
where
he
has
succeeded
and
failed
the
desire
for
artist
who
exceeds
the
limit
of
his
strength
in
all
that
he
undertakes
will
end
by
carrying
the
multitude
along
with
him
through
the
spectacle
of
violent
wrestling
that
he
affords
success
is
not
always
the
accompaniment
only
of
victory
but
also
of
the
desire
for
victory
sensible
author
writes
for
no
other
posterity
than
his
is
for
his
as
to
be
able
even
then
to
take
pleasure
in
himself
praise
of
the
good
aphorism
is
too
hard
for
the
tooth
of
time
and
is
not
worn
away
by
all
the
centuries
although
it
serves
as
food
for
every
epoch
hence
it
is
the
greatest
paradox
in
literature
the
imperishable
in
the
midst
of
change
the
nourishment
which
always
remains
highly
valued
as
salt
does
and
never
becomes
stupid
like
salt
the
of
the
second
people
may
have
something
of
what
can
be
called
but
it
is
small
and
can
be
cheaply
satisfied
on
the
whole
the
remnant
of
art
it
must
be
honestly
confessed
suffices
for
this
need
let
us
consider
for
example
the
kind
of
melodies
and
songs
in
which
the
most
vigorous
unspoiled
and
classes
of
the
population
find
genuine
delight
let
us
live
among
shepherds
cowherds
peasants
huntsmen
soldiers
and
sailors
and
give
ourselves
the
answer
and
in
the
country
town
just
in
the
houses
that
are
the
homes
of
inherited
civic
virtue
is
it
not
the
worst
music
at
present
produced
that
is
loved
and
one
might
say
cherished
he
who
speaks
of
deeper
needs
and
unsatisfied
yearnings
for
art
among
the
people
as
it
is
is
a
crank
or
an
impostor
be
honest
only
in
exceptional
men
is
there
now
an
in
the
highest
art
is
once
more
on
the
and
human
powers
and
hopes
are
for
the
time
being
directed
to
other
from
this
outside
the
populace
there
exists
indeed
in
the
higher
and
highest
strata
of
society
a
broader
and
more
comprehensive
but
the
second
here
there
is
a
sort
of
artistic
commune
which
possibly
means
to
be
sincere
but
let
us
look
at
the
elements
they
are
in
general
the
more
refined
malcontents
who
attain
no
genuine
pleasure
in
themselves
the
cultured
who
have
not
become
free
enough
to
dispense
with
the
consolations
of
religion
and
yet
do
not
find
its
incense
sufficiently
fragrant
the
who
are
too
weak
to
combat
by
a
heroic
conversion
or
renunciation
the
one
fundamental
error
of
their
lives
or
the
pernicious
bent
of
their
characters
the
highly
gifted
who
think
themselves
too
dignified
to
be
of
service
by
modest
activity
and
are
too
lazy
for
real
work
girls
who
can
not
create
for
themselves
a
satisfactory
sphere
of
duties
women
who
have
tied
themselves
by
a
or
nefarious
marriage
and
know
that
they
are
not
tied
securely
enough
scholars
physicians
merchants
officials
who
specialised
too
early
and
never
gave
their
lives
a
free
enough
do
their
work
efficiently
it
is
true
but
with
a
worm
gnawing
at
their
hearts
finally
all
imperfect
are
nowadays
the
true
needers
of
art
what
do
they
really
desire
from
art
art
is
to
drive
away
hours
and
moments
of
discomfort
boredom
conscience
and
if
possible
transform
the
faults
of
their
lives
and
characters
into
faults
of
very
different
were
the
greeks
who
realised
in
their
art
the
outflow
and
overflow
of
their
own
sense
of
and
health
and
loved
to
see
their
perfection
once
more
from
a
standpoint
outside
themselves
they
were
led
to
art
by
delight
in
themselves
our
disgust
of
themselves
the
germans
in
the
real
theatrical
talent
of
the
germans
was
kotzebue
he
and
his
germans
those
of
higher
as
well
as
those
of
society
were
necessarily
associated
and
his
contemporaries
should
have
said
of
him
in
all
seriousness
in
him
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
here
was
constraint
pretence
or
what
he
could
and
would
do
was
understood
yes
until
now
the
honest
theatrical
success
on
the
german
stage
has
been
in
the
hands
of
the
shamefaced
or
unashamed
heirs
of
kotzebue
s
methods
and
is
as
far
as
comedy
still
flourishes
at
all
the
result
is
that
much
of
the
germanism
of
that
age
sometimes
far
off
from
the
great
towns
still
survives
incontinent
in
small
pleasures
always
ready
for
tears
with
the
desire
in
the
theatre
at
any
rate
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
their
innate
sobriety
and
strict
attention
to
duty
and
exercise
a
smiling
nay
a
laughing
indulgence
confusing
goodness
and
sympathy
and
welding
them
into
one
as
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
german
sentimentality
exceedingly
happy
at
a
noble
magnanimous
action
for
the
rest
submissive
towards
superiors
envious
of
each
other
and
yet
in
their
heart
of
hearts
thoroughly
were
they
and
such
was
second
dramatic
talent
was
schiller
he
discovered
a
class
of
hearers
which
had
hitherto
never
been
taken
into
consideration
among
the
callow
german
youth
of
both
sexes
his
poetry
responded
to
their
higher
nobler
more
violent
if
more
confused
emotions
their
delight
in
the
jingle
of
moral
words
a
delight
that
begins
to
disappear
when
we
reach
the
thirties
thus
he
won
for
himself
by
virtue
of
the
passionateness
and
partisanship
of
the
young
a
success
which
gradually
reacted
with
advantage
upon
those
of
riper
years

goethe

still
stands
above

out
of

ways

himself
did
not
wish
it
to
be
the
romantics
set
up
their
goethe
cult
when
their
amazing
skill
in
appreciation
was
passed
on
to
the
disciples
of
hegel
the
real
educators
of
the
germans
of
this
century
when
the
awakening
national
ambition
turned
out
advantageous
to
the
fame
of
the
german
poets
when
the
real
standard
of
the
nation
as
to
whether
it
could
honestly
find
enjoyment
in
anything
became
inexorably
subordinated
to
the
judgment
of
individuals
and
to
that
national
ambition
is
when
people
began
to
enjoy
by
compulsion
arose
that
false
spurious
german
culture
which
was
ashamed
of
kotzebue
which
brought
sophocles
calderon
and
even
the
second
part
of
goethe
s
on
the
stage
and
which
on
account
of
its
foul
tongue
and
congested
stomach
no
longer
knows
now
what
it
likes
and
what
it
finds
are
those
who
have
taste
even
if
it
be
a
bad
taste
only
by
this
characteristic
can
one
be
wise
as
well
as
happy
hence
the
greeks
who
were
very
refined
in
such
matters
designated
the
sage
by
a
word
that
means
man
of
taste
and
called
wisdom
artistic
as
well
as
scientific
taste
music
as
a
in
every
all
the
arts
that
are
accustomed
to
grow
on
a
definite
and
under
definite
social
and
political
conditions
music
is
the
last
plant
to
come
up
arising
in
the
autumn
and
of
the
culture
to
which
it
belongs
at
the
same
time
the
first
signs
and
harbingers
of
a
new
spring
are
usually
already
noticeable
and
sometimes
music
like
the
language
of
a
forgotten
age
rings
out
into
a
new
astonished
world
and
comes
too
late
in
the
art
of
the
dutch
and
flemish
musicians
the
soul
of
the
christian
middle
ages
at
last
found
its
fullest
tone
their
is
the
posthumous
but
legitimate
and
equal
sister
of
gothic
not
until
handel
s
music
was
heard
the
note
of
the
best
in
the
soul
of
luther
and
his
kin
the
great
impulse
that
created
the
whole
reformation
movement
mozart
first
expressed
in
golden
melody
the
age
of
louis
xiv
and
the
art
of
racine
and
claude
lorrain
the
eighteenth
century
of
rhapsody
of
broken
ideals
and
transitory
sang
itself
out
in
the
music
of
beethoven
and
rossini
a
lover
of
sentimental
similes
might
say
that
all
really
important
music
was
a
is
in
fact
not
a
universal
language
for
all
time
as
is
so
often
said
in
its
praise
but
responds
exactly
to
a
particular
period
and
warmth
of
emotion
which
involves
a
quite
definite
individual
culture
determined
by
time
and
place
as
its
inner
law
the
music
of
palestrina
would
be
quite
unintelligible
to
a
greek
and
again
what
would
the
music
of
rossini
convey
to
palestrina
may
be
that
our
most
modern
german
music
with
all
its
and
desire
of
will
soon
be
no
longer
understood
for
this
music
sprang
from
a
culture
that
is
undergoing
a
rapid
decay
from
the
soil
of
that
epoch
of
reaction
and
restoration
in
which
a
certain
catholicism
of
feeling
as
well
as
a
delight
in
all
indigenous
national
primitive
manners
burst
into
bloom
and
scattered
a
blended
perfume
over
europe
these
two
emotional
tendencies
adopted
in
their
greatest
strength
and
carried
to
their
farthest
limits
found
final
expression
in
the
music
of
wagner
wagner
s
predilection
for
the
old
native
sagas
his
free
idealisation
of
their
unfamiliar
gods
and
heroes
are
really
sovereign
beasts
of
prey
with
occasional
fits
of
thoughtfulness
magnanimity
and
boredom
of
those
figures
to
which
he
gave
in
addition
the
mediæval
christian
thirst
for
ecstatic
sensuality
and
this
wagnerian
with
regard
to
materials
souls
figures
and
clearly
express
the
spirit
of
his
music
if
it
could
not
like
all
music
speak
quite
unambiguously
of
itself
this
spirit
wages
the
last
campaign
of
reaction
against
the
spirit
of
illumination
which
passed
into
this
century
from
the
last
and
also
against
the
ideas
of
french
revolutionary
romanticism
and
of
english
and
american
insipidity
in
the
reconstruction
of
state
and
is
it
not
evident
that
the
spheres
of
thought
and
emotion
apparently
suppressed
by
wagner
and
his
school
have
long
since
acquired
fresh
strength
and
that
his
late
musical
protest
against
them
generally
rings
into
ears
that
prefer
to
hear
different
and
opposite
notes
so
that
one
day
that
high
and
wonderful
art
will
suddenly
become
unintelligible
and
will
be
covered
by
the
spider
s
web
of
oblivion
considering
this
state
of
affairs
we
must
not
let
ourselves
be
led
astray
by
those
transitory
fluctuations
which
arise
like
a
reaction
within
a
reaction
as
a
temporary
sinking
of
the
mountainous
wave
in
the
midst
of
the
general
upheaval
thus
this
decade
of
national
war
ultramontane
martyrdom
and
socialistic
unrest
may
in
its
remoter
even
aid
the
wagnerian
art
to
acquire
a
sudden
halo
without
guaranteeing
that
it
has
a
future
or
that
it
has
future
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
music
that
the
fruits
of
its
great
should
lose
their
taste
and
wither
earlier
than
the
fruits
of
the
plastic
arts
or
those
that
grow
on
the
tree
of
knowledge
among
all
the
products
of
the
human
artistic
sense
ideas
are
the
most
solid
and
lasting
the
poet
no
longer
a
as
it
may
sound
to
our
time
there
were
once
poets
and
artists
whose
soul
was
above
the
passions
with
their
delights
and
convulsions
and
who
therefore
took
their
pleasure
in
purer
materials
worthier
men
more
delicate
complications
and
dénouements
if
the
artists
of
our
day
for
the
most
part
unfetter
the
will
and
so
are
under
certain
circumstances
for
that
very
reason
emancipators
of
life
those
were
tamers
of
the
will
enchanters
of
animals
creators
of
men
in
fact
they
moulded
and
life
whereas
the
fame
of
poets
of
our
day
lies
in
unharnessing
unchaining
and
ancient
greeks
demanded
of
the
poet
that
he
should
be
the
teacher
of
grown
men
how
ashamed
the
poet
would
be
now
if
this
demand
were
made
of
him
he
is
not
even
a
good
student
of
himself
and
so
never
himself
becomes
a
good
poem
or
a
fine
picture
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
he
remains
the
shy
attractive
ruin
of
a
temple
but
at
the
same
time
a
cavern
of
cravings
overgrown
like
a
ruin
with
flowers
nettles
and
poisonous
weeds
inhabited
and
haunted
by
snakes
worms
spiders
and
birds
an
object
for
sad
reflection
as
to
why
the
noblest
and
most
precious
must
grow
up
at
once
like
a
ruin
without
the
past
and
future
of
perfection
looking
forward
and
art
like
that
which
streams
out
of
homer
sophocles
theocritus
calderon
racine
goethe
as
the
superabundance
of
a
wise
and
harmonious
conduct
of
is
the
true
art
at
which
we
grasp
when
we
have
ourselves
become
wiser
and
more
harmonious
it
is
not
that
barbaric
if
ever
so
delightful
outpouring
of
hot
and
highly
coloured
things
from
an
undisciplined
chaotic
soul
which
is
what
we
understood
by
art
in
our
youth
it
is
obvious
from
the
nature
of
the
case
that
for
certain
periods
of
life
an
art
of
overstrain
excitement
antipathy
to
the
orderly
monotonous
simple
logical
is
an
inevitable
need
to
which
artists
must
respond
lest
the
soul
of
such
periods
should
unburden
itself
in
other
ways
through
all
kinds
of
disorder
and
impropriety
hence
youths
as
they
generally
are
full
fermenting
tortured
above
all
things
by
boredom
and
women
who
lack
work
that
fully
occupies
their
soul
require
that
art
of
delightful
disorder
all
the
more
violently
on
that
account
are
they
inflamed
with
a
desire
for
satisfaction
without
change
happiness
without
stupor
and
intoxication
against
the
art
of
works
of
is
above
all
and
first
of
all
meant
to
embellish
life
to
make
us
ourselves
endurable
and
if
possible
agreeable
in
the
eyes
of
others
with
this
task
in
view
art
moderates
us
and
holds
us
in
restraint
creates
forms
of
intercourse
binds
over
the
uneducated
to
laws
of
decency
cleanliness
politeness
speech
and
silence
hence
art
must
conceal
or
transfigure
everything
that
is
painful
terrible
and
disgusting
elements
which
in
spite
of
every
effort
will
always
break
out
afresh
in
accordance
with
the
very
origin
of
human
nature
art
has
to
perform
this
duty
especially
in
regard
to
the
passions
and
spiritual
agonies
and
anxieties
and
to
cause
the
significant
factor
to
shine
through
unavoidable
or
unconquerable
ugliness
to
this
great
task
the
art
proper
that
of
works
of
art
is
a
mere
accessary
a
man
who
feels
within
himself
a
surplus
of
such
powers
of
embellishment
concealment
and
transfiguration
will
finally
seek
to
unburden
himself
of
this
surplus
in
works
of
art
the
same
holds
good
under
special
circumstances
of
a
whole
as
a
rule
we
nowadays
begin
art
at
the
end
hang
on
to
its
tail
and
think
that
works
of
art
constitute
art
proper
and
that
life
should
be
improved
and
transformed
by
this
that
we
are
if
we
begin
a
dinner
with
dessert
and
try
sweet
after
sweet
small
wonder
that
we
ruin
our
digestions
and
even
our
appetites
for
the
good
hearty
nourishing
meal
to
which
art
invites
us
continued
existence
of
really
does
a
creative
art
nowadays
continue
to
exist
because
the
majority
who
have
hours
of
leisure
and
such
an
art
is
for
them
only
think
that
they
can
not
fill
up
their
time
without
music
theatres
and
novels
and
poetry
granted
that
one
could
keep
them
from
this
indulgence
either
they
would
strive
less
eagerly
for
leisure
and
the
invidious
sight
of
the
rich
would
be
less
common
a
great
gain
for
the
stability
of
society
or
they
would
have
leisure
but
would
learn
to
reflect
on
what
can
be
learnt
and
unlearnt
on
their
work
for
instance
their
associations
the
pleasure
they
could
bestow
all
the
world
with
the
exception
of
the
artist
would
in
both
cases
reap
the
there
are
many
vigorous
sensible
readers
who
could
take
objection
to
this
still
it
must
be
said
on
behalf
of
the
coarse
and
malignant
that
the
author
himself
is
concerned
with
this
protest
and
that
there
is
in
his
book
much
to
be
read
that
is
not
actually
written
down
therein
the
mouthpiece
of
the
poet
expresses
the
universal
higher
opinions
of
the
nation
he
is
its
mouthpiece
and
flute
but
by
virtue
of
metre
and
all
other
artistic
means
he
so
expresses
them
that
the
nation
regards
them
as
something
quite
new
and
wonderful
and
believes
in
all
seriousness
that
he
is
the
mouthpiece
of
the
gods
yes
under
the
clouds
of
creation
the
poet
himself
forgets
whence
he
derives
all
his
intellectual
father
and
mother
from
teachers
and
books
of
all
kinds
from
the
street
and
particularly
from
the
priest
he
is
deceived
by
his
own
art
and
really
believes
in
a
naïve
period
that
a
god
is
speaking
through
him
that
he
is
creating
in
a
state
of
religious
inspiration
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
only
saying
what
he
has
learnt
a
medley
of
popular
wisdom
and
popular
foolishness
hence
so
far
as
a
poet
is
really
he
is
held
to
be
what
all
art
wants
to
do
and
can
not
last
and
hardest
task
of
the
artist
is
the
presentment
of
what
remains
the
same
reposes
in
itself
is
lofty
and
simple
and
free
from
the
bizarre
hence
the
noblest
forms
of
moral
perfection
are
rejected
as
inartistic
by
weaker
artists
because
the
sight
of
these
fruits
is
too
painful
for
their
ambition
the
fruit
gleams
at
them
from
the
topmost
branches
of
art
but
they
lack
the
ladder
the
courage
the
grip
to
venture
so
high
in
himself
a
phidias
is
quite
possible
as
a
poet
but
if
modern
strength
be
taken
into
consideration
almost
solely
in
the
sense
that
to
god
nothing
is
impossible
the
desire
for
a
poetical
claude
lorrain
is
already
an
immodesty
at
present
however
earnestly
one
man
s
heart
may
yearn
for
such
a
presentment
of
the
highest
man
the
most
simple
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
complete
has
hitherto
been
beyond
the
scope
of
all
artists
perhaps
however
the
greeks
in
the
ideal
of
athene
saw
farther
than
any
men
did
before
or
after
their
time
art
and
retrograde
movements
in
history
the
periods
of
restoration
which
try
to
revive
intellectual
and
social
conditions
that
existed
before
those
immediately
preceding
seem
really
to
succeed
in
giving
them
a
brief
resurrection
the
charm
of
sentimental
recollection
ardent
longing
for
what
is
almost
lost
hasty
embracing
of
a
transitory
happiness
it
is
on
account
of
this
strange
trend
towards
seriousness
that
in
such
transient
and
almost
dreamy
periods
art
and
poetry
find
a
natural
soil
just
as
the
tenderest
and
rarest
plants
grow
on
of
steep
many
a
good
artist
is
unwittingly
impelled
to
a
restoration
way
of
thinking
in
politics
and
society
for
which
on
his
own
account
he
prepares
a
quiet
little
corner
and
garden
here
he
collects
about
himself
the
human
remains
of
the
historical
epoch
that
appeals
to
him
and
plays
his
lyre
to
many
who
are
dead
and
weary
to
death
perhaps
with
the
result
of
a
brief
resurrection
happiness
of
the
two
respects
our
age
is
to
be
accounted
happy
with
respect
to
the
we
enjoy
all
cultures
and
their
productions
and
nurture
ourselves
on
the
noblest
blood
of
all
periods
we
stand
sufficiently
near
to
the
magic
of
the
forces
from
whose
womb
these
periods
are
born
to
be
able
in
passing
to
submit
to
their
spell
with
pleasure
and
terror
whereas
earlier
cultures
could
only
enjoy
themselves
and
never
looked
beyond
themselves
but
were
rather
overarched
by
a
bell
of
broader
or
narrower
dome
through
which
indeed
light
streamed
down
to
them
but
which
their
gaze
could
not
pierce
with
respect
to
the
there
opens
out
to
us
for
the
first
time
a
mighty
comprehensive
vista
of
human
and
economic
purposes
engirdling
the
whole
inhabited
globe
at
the
same
time
we
feel
conscious
of
a
power
ourselves
to
take
this
new
task
in
hand
without
presumption
without
requiring
supernatural
aids
yes
whatever
the
result
of
our
enterprise
however
much
we
may
have
overestimated
our
strength
at
any
rate
we
need
render
account
to
no
one
but
ourselves
and
mankind
can
henceforth
begin
to
do
with
itself
what
it
are
it
is
true
peculiar
human
bees
who
only
know
how
to
suck
the
bitterest
and
worst
elements
from
the
chalice
of
every
flower
it
is
true
that
all
flowers
contain
something
that
is
not
honey
but
these
bees
may
be
allowed
to
feel
in
their
own
way
about
the
happiness
of
our
time
and
continue
to
build
up
their
hive
of
discomfort
a
of
instruction
and
meditation
for
adults
even
the
most
mature
and
such
institutions
visited
without
compulsion
but
in
accordance
with
the
moral
injunction
of
the
whole
community
the
churches
as
the
most
worthy
and
rich
in
memories
for
the
purpose
at
the
same
time
daily
festivals
in
honour
of
the
reason
that
is
attained
and
attainable
by
man
a
newer
and
fuller
budding
and
blooming
of
the
ideal
of
the
teacher
in
which
the
clergyman
the
artist
and
the
physician
the
man
of
science
and
the
sage
are
blended
and
their
individual
virtues
should
come
to
the
fore
as
a
collective
virtue
in
their
teaching
itself
in
their
discourses
in
their
is
my
vision
of
which
i
firmly
believe
that
it
has
raised
a
corner
of
the
veil
of
the
future
education
a
extraordinary
haphazardness
of
the
whole
system
of
education
which
leads
every
adult
to
say
nowadays
that
his
sole
educator
was
chance
and
the
of
educational
methods
and
aims
may
be
explained
as
follows
the
oldest
and
the
newest
as
in
a
turbulent
would
rather
be
heard
than
understood
and
wish
to
prove
at
all
costs
by
their
outcries
and
clamourings
that
they
still
exist
or
already
exist
the
poor
teachers
and
educators
are
first
dazed
by
this
senseless
noise
then
become
silent
and
finally
apathetic
allowing
anything
to
be
done
to
them
just
as
they
in
their
turn
allow
anything
to
be
done
to
their
pupils
they
are
not
trained
themselves
so
how
are
they
to
train
others
they
are
themselves
no
vigorous
succulent
trees
and
he
who
wishes
to
attach
himself
to
them
must
wind
and
bend
himself
and
finally
become
distorted
and
deformed
as
they
philosophers
and
artists
of
the
and
frigidity
burning
desires
and
waning
of
the
heart
s
wretched
medley
is
to
be
found
in
the
picture
of
the
highest
european
society
of
the
present
day
there
the
artist
thinks
that
he
is
achieving
a
great
deal
when
through
his
art
he
lights
the
torch
of
the
heart
as
well
as
the
torch
of
desire
the
philosopher
has
the
same
notion
when
in
the
chilliness
of
his
heart
which
he
has
in
common
with
his
age
he
cools
hot
desires
in
himself
and
his
following
by
his
judgments
not
to
be
a
soldier
of
culture
without

people
are
learning
what
it
costs
us
so
dear
not
to
know
in
our
we
must
first
do
superior
actions
and
secondly
seek
the
superior
wherever
and
under
whatever
names
it
is
to
be
found
that
we
must
at
once
go
out
of
the
way
of
all
badness
and
mediocrity
fighting
and
that
even
doubt
as
to
the
excellence
of
a
thing
such
as
quickly
arises
in
one
of
practised
taste
should
rank
as
an
argument
against
it
and
a
reason
for
completely
avoiding
it
we
must
not
shrink
from
the
danger
of
occasionally
making
a
mistake
and
confounding
the
less
accessible
good
with
the
bad
and
imperfect
only
he
who
can
do
nothing
better
should
attack
the
world
s
evils
as
the
soldier
of
culture
but
those
who
should
support
culture
and
spread
its
teachings
ruin
themselves
if
they
go
about
armed
and
by
precautions
and
bad
dreams
turn
the
peace
of
their
domestic
and
artistic
life
into
sinister
unrest
how
natural
history
should
be
history
like
the
history
of
the
war
and
victory
of
moral
and
intellectual
forces
in
the
campaign
against
anxiety
laziness
superstition
folly
should
be
so
expounded
that
every
reader
or
listener
may
be
continually
aroused
to
strive
after
mental
and
physical
health
and
soundness
after
the
feeling
of
joy
and
be
awakened
to
the
desire
to
be
the
heir
and
continuator
of
mankind
to
an
ever
nobler
adventurous
impulse
hitherto
natural
history
has
not
found
its
true
language
because
the
inventive
and
eloquent
are
needed
for
this
rid
themselves
of
a
secret
mistrust
of
it
and
above
all
never
wish
to
learn
from
it
a
thorough
lesson
nevertheless
it
must
be
conceded
to
the
english
that
their
scientific
manuals
for
the
lower
strata
of
the
people
have
made
admirable
strides
towards
that
ideal
but
then
such
books
are
written
by
their
foremost
men
of
learning
full
complete
and
inspiring
natures
and
not
as
among
us
by
mediocre
investigators
genius
in
genius
according
to
schopenhauer
s
observation
lies
in
the
coherent
and
vivid
recollection
of
our
own
experience
a
striving
towards
genius
in
humanity
collectively
might
be
deduced
from
the
striving
towards
knowledge
of
the
whole
historic
is
beginning
to
mark
off
the
modern
age
more
and
more
as
compared
with
earlier
ages
and
has
for
the
first
time
broken
down
the
barriers
between
nature
and
spirit
men
and
animals
morality
and
physics
a
perfectly
conceived
history
would
be
cosmic
the
cult
of
great
minds
is
bestowed
the
terrifying
of
their
natures
their
blindnesses
deformities
and
extravagances
so
that
their
more
powerful
easily
influence
may
be
continually
held
within
bounds
through
the
distrust
aroused
by
such
qualities
for
the
of
all
that
humanity
needs
for
its
continued
existence
is
so
comprehensive
and
demands
powers
so
diverse
and
so
numerous
that
for
every
predilection
whether
in
science
or
politics
or
art
or
commerce
to
which
such
natures
would
persuade
us
mankind
as
a
whole
has
to
pay
a
heavy
price
it
has
always
been
a
great
disaster
to
culture
when
human
beings
are
worshipped
in
this
sense
we
may
understand
the
precept
of
mosaic
law
which
forbids
us
to
have
any
other
gods
but
by
side
with
the
cult
of
genius
and
violence
we
must
always
place
as
its
complement
and
remedy
the
cult
of
culture
this
cult
can
find
an
intelligent
appreciation
even
for
the
material
the
inferior
the
mean
the
misunderstood
the
weak
the
imperfect
the
the
incomplete
the
untrue
the
apparent
even
the
wicked
and
horrible
and
can
grant
them
the
concession
that
this
is
for
the
continued
harmony
of
all
things
human
attained
by
amazing
toil
and
strokes
of
luck
and
just
as
much
the
work
of
cyclopes
and
ants
as
of
geniuses
shall
never
be
lost
how
indeed
could
we
dispense
with
that
deep
universal
and
often
uncanny
bass
without
which
after
all
melody
can
not
be
melody
the
antique
world
and
man
of
the
antique
world
understood
better
how
to
rejoice
we
understand
better
how
to
grieve
less
they
continually
found
new
motives
for
feeling
happy
for
celebrating
festivals
being
inventive
with
all
their
wealth
of
shrewdness
and
reflection
we
on
the
other
hand
concentrate
our
intellect
rather
on
the
solving
of
problems
which
have
in
view
painlessness
and
the
removal
of
sources
of
discomfort
with
regard
to
suffering
existence
the
ancients
sought
to
forget
or
in
some
way
to
convert
the
sensation
into
a
pleasant
one
thus
trying
to
supply
palliatives
we
attack
the
causes
of
suffering
and
on
the
whole
prefer
to
use
we
are
only
building
upon
a
foundation
whereon
a
later
age
will
once
more
set
up
the
temple
of
joy
the
muses
as
we
know
how
to
tell
many
lies
so
sang
the
muses
once
when
they
revealed
themselves
to
conception
of
the
artist
as
deceiver
once
grasped

to
important
discoveries
how
paradoxical
homer
can
there
anything
more
desperate
more
horrible
more
incredible
shining
over
human
destiny
like
a
winter
sun
than
that
idea
of
homer
s
so
the
decree
of
the
gods
willed
it
and
doomed

to
perish
that
it
might
be
a
matter
for
song
even
to
distant
generations
in
other
words
we
suffer
and
perish
so
that
poets
may
not
lack
material
and
this
is
the
dispensation
of
those
very
gods
of
homer
who
seem
much
concerned
about
the
joyousness
of
generations
to
come
but
very
little
about

by

and
every
author
has
his

a
team
of
of
thought
and
outbursts
of
sentimentality

as
often
wedded
to
the
reckless
desire
to
have
one

or
by

towards

in
the
heads
of
men
that
there
arises
the
force
that

the

in

the

are
curious
marksmen
who
miss
their
mark
but
leave
the
with
secret
pride
in
the
fact
that
their
bullet
at
any
rate
flew
very
far
beyond
the
mark
it
is
true
or
that
it
did
not
hit
the

but
hit

else
there

from

as
enemies
towards
an
intellectual
tendency
or
movement
when
we
are
superior
to
it
and
disapprove
of
its
aim
or
when
its
aim
is
too
high
and
unrecognisable
to
our
other
words
when
it
is
superior
to
us
so
the
same
party
may
be
attacked
from
two
sides
from
above
and
from
below
not
infrequently
the
assailants
from
common
hatred
form
an
alliance
which
is
more
repulsive
than
all
that
they
hate
minds
are
distinguished
not
by
being
the
first
to
see
a
new
thing
but
by
seeing
the
old
thing
which
is
seen
and
overlooked
by
every
one
as
something
new
the
first
discoverer
is
usually
that
quite
ordinary
and
unintellectual
error
of
philosopher
believes
that
the
value
of
his
philosophy
lies
in
the
whole
in
the
structure
posterity
finds
it
in
the
stone
with
which
he
built
and
with
which
from
that
time
forth
men
will
build
oftener
and
other
words
in
the
fact
that
the
structure
may
be
destroyed
and
yet
have
value
as
material
is
the
epitaph
of
an
emotion
the
moment
before
science
it
occurs
every
day
and
every
hour
that
a
man
immediately
before
the
solution
remains
stuck
being
convinced
that
his
efforts
have
been
entirely
in
one
who
in
untying
a
noose
hesitates
at
the
moment
when
it
is
nearest
to
coming
loose
because
at
that
very
moment
it
looks
most
like
a
knot
among
the
thoughtful
man
and
he
who
is
sure
of
his
intelligence
may
profitably
consort
with
visionaries
for
a
decade
and
abandon
himself
in
their
torrid
zone
to
a
moderate
insanity
he
will
thus
have
travelled
a
good
part
of
the
road
towards
that
cosmopolitanism
of
the
intellect
which
can
say
without
presumption
nothing
intellectual
is
alien
to
keen
best
and
healthiest
element
in
science
as
amid
the
mountains
is
the
keen
air
that
plays
about
such
as
artists
dread
and
abuse
science
on
account
of
this
atmosphere
why
savants
are
nobler
than
requires
nobler
natures
than
does
poetry
natures
that
are
more
simple
less
ambitious
more
restrained
calmer
that
think
less
of
posthumous
fame
and
can
bury
themselves
in
studies
which
in
the
eye
of
the
many
scarcely
seem
worthy
of
such
a
sacrifice
of
personality
there
is
another
loss
of
which
they
are
conscious
the
nature
of
their
occupation
its
continual
exaction
of
the
greatest
sobriety
weakens
their
will
the
fire
is
not
kept
up
so
vigorously
as
on
the
hearths
of
poetic
minds
as
such
they
often
lose
their
strength
and
prime
earlier
than
artists
as
has
been
said
they
are
aware
of
their
danger
under
all
circumstances
they
seem
less
gifted
because
they
shine
less
and
thus
they
will
always
be
rated
below
their
value
how
far
piety
later
centuries
the
great
man
is
credited
with
all
the
great
qualities
and
virtues
of
his
century
thus
all
that
is
best
is
continually
obscured
by
piety
which
treats
the
picture
as
a
sacred
one
to
be
surrounded
with
all
manner
of
votive
offerings
in
the
end
the
picture
is
completely
veiled
and
covered
by
the
offerings
and
thenceforth
is
more
an
object
of
faith
than
of
contemplation
standing
on
one
s
we
make
truth
stand
on
its
head
we
generally
fail
to
notice
that
our
own
head
too

not
in
its
right
position

and

obvious
satisfaction
of

and
gradually
creates
the

of

and
indeed
attain
that

comforting
satisfaction
with
their
own
form
consider
how
many
reasons
every
man
has
for
anxiety
and
shy
and
how
on
this
account
of
his
energy
and
goodwill
is
crippled
and
may
become
unproductive
so
we
must
be
very
grateful
to
fashion
for
unfettering
that

the
power
of
cheerful
compromise

those
who
feel

so
long
as
many
persons
have
submitted

their

looseners
of

many
men
and
books
rests
solely
on
their
faculty
for
compelling
all
to
speak
out
the
most
hidden
and
intimate
things
they
are
looseners
of
tongues
and
crowbars

most
stubborn

of

could
dare
to
call
himself
a
free
spirit
if
he
could
not
render
homage
after
his
fashion
by
taking
on
his
own
shoulders
a
portion
of
that
burden
of
public
dislike
and
abuse
to
men
to
whom
this
name
is
attached
as
a
reproach
we
might
as
well
call
ourselves
in
all
seriousness
spirits
free
of
domicile
and
without
that
arrogant
or
defiance
because
we
feel
the
impulse
to
freedom
zur
as
the
strongest
instinct
of
our
minds
and
in
contrast
to
fixed
and
limited
minds
practically
see
our
ideal
in
an
intellectual
use
a
modest
and
almost
depreciatory
expression
yes
the
favour
of
the
muses
homer
says
on
this
point
goes
right
to
our
heart
so
true
so
terrible
is
it
the
muse
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
and
gave
him
good
and
evil
for
she
took
away
his
eyes
and
vouchsafed
him
sweet
this
is
an
endless
text
for
thinking
men
she
gives
good
and
evil
that
is
manner
of
loving
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
and
each
man
will
interpret
specially
for
himself
why
we
poets
and
thinkers
have
to
give
up
our
eyes
in
her
service
against
the
cultivation
of
artistic
training
of
the

upwards
by

of

an
estimable
gain
in

enduring
in
the

of

and
circumstances
no
similar
secondary
advantage
arises
from
the
artistic
cultivation
of
the
ear
whence
public
schools
will
generally
do
well
to
give
the
art
of
the
eye
a
preference
over
that
of
the
ear
the
discoverers
of
minds
from
which
nothing
is
farther
than
trivialities

a
triviality
after
taking

paths

to
the
astonishment
of
the

morals
of
regular
and
rapid
advance
in
the
sciences
is
only
possible
when
the
individual
is
compelled
to
be
not
so
distrustful
as
to
test
every
calculation
and
assertion
of
others
in
fields
which
are
remote
from
his

a
necessary
condition
however
is
that
every
man
should
have
competitors
in
his
own
sphere
who
are
extremely
distrustful

keep
a

upon
him

extremely
distrustful

that

in
order
to
have
the
right
of
being
silent
about
that
these
greeks
themselves
may
whisper
something
in
the
ear
of
the
reflective
reader
thus
the
greeks
facilitate
to
modern
men
the
communication
of
much
that
is
debatable
and
hard
to
communicate
of
the
acquired
character
of
the
are
easily
led
astray
by
the
renowned
greek
clearness
transparency
simplicity
and
order
by
their
naturalness
and
art
into
believing
that
all
these
gifts
were
bestowed
on
the
instance
that
they
could
not
but
write
well
as
lichtenberg
expressed
it
on
one
occasion
yet
no
statement
could
be
more
hasty
and
more
untenable
the
history
of
prose
from
gorgias
to
demosthenes
shows
a
course
of
toiling
and
wrestling
towards
light
from
the
obscure
overloaded
and
tasteless
reminding
one
of
the
labour
of
heroes
who
had
to
construct
the
first
roads
through
forest
and
bog
the
dialogue
of
tragedy
was
the
real
achievement
of
the
dramatist
owing
to
its
uncommon
clearness
and
precision
whereas
the
national
tendency
was
to
riot
in
symbolism
and
innuendo
a
tendency
expressly
fostered
by
the
great
choral
lyric
similarly
it
was
the
achievement
of
homer
to
liberate
the
greeks
from
asiatic
pomp
and
gloom
and
to
have
attained
the
clearness
of
architecture
in
details
great
and
small
nor
was
it
by
any
means
thought
easy
to
say
anything
in
a
pure
and
illuminating
style
how
else
should
we
account
for
the
great
admiration
for
the
epigram
of
simonides
which
shows
itself
so
simple
with
no
gilded
points
or
arabesques
of
wit
but
says
all
that
it
has
to
say
plainly
and
with
the
calm
of
the
sun
not
with
the
straining
after
effect
of
the
lightning
since
the
struggle
towards
light
from
an
almost
native
twilight
is
greek
a
thrill
of
jubilation
runs
through
the
people
when
they
hear
a
laconic
sentence
the
language
of
elegy
or
the
maxims
of
the
seven
wise
men
hence
they
were
so
fond
of
giving
precepts
in
verse
a
practice
that
we
find
objectionable
this
was
the
true
apolline
task
of
the
hellenic
spirit
with
the
aim
of
rising
superior
to
the
perils
of
metre
and
the
obscurity
which
is
otherwise
characteristic
of
poetry
simplicity
flexibility
and
sobriety
were
wrestled
for
and
not
given
by
nature
to
this
people
the
danger
of
a
relapse
into
asianism
constantly
hovered
over
the
greeks
and
really
overtook
them
from
time
to
time
like
a
murky
overflowing
tide
of
mystical
impulses
primitive
savagery
and
darkness
we
see
them
plunge
in
we
see
europe
as
it
were
flooded
washed
europe
was
very
small
then
but
they
always
emerge
once
more
to
the
light
good
swimmers
and
divers
that
they
are
those
of
odysseus
the
pagan
there
is
nothing
more
astonishing
to
the
observer
of
the
greek
world
than
to
discover
that
the
greeks
from
time
to
time
held
festivals
as
it
were
for
all
their
passions
and
evil
tendencies
alike
and
in
fact
even
established
a
kind
of
series
of
festivals
by
order
of
the
state
for
their
this
is
the
pagan
characteristic
of
their
world
which
christianity
has
never
understood
and
never
can
understand
and
has
always
combated
and
accepted
this
as
unavoidable
and
preferred
instead
of
railing
at
it
to
give
it
a
kind
of
secondary
right
by
grafting
it
on
to
the
usages
of
society
and
religion
all
in
man
that
has
power
they
called
divine
and
wrote
it
on
the
walls
of
their
heaven
they
do
not
deny
this
natural
instinct
that
expresses
itself
in
evil
characteristics
but
regulate
and
limit
it
to
definite
cults
and
days
so
as
to
turn
those
turbulent
streams
into
as
harmless
a
course
as
possible
after
devising
sufficient
precautionary
measures
that
is
the
root
of
all
the
moral
of
antiquity
to
the
wicked
the
dubious
the
backward
the
animal
element
as
to
the
barbaric
and
asiatic
which
still
lived
in
the
depths
of
greek
nature
they
allowed
a
moderate
outflow
and
did
not
strive
to
destroy
it
utterly
the
whole
system
was
under
the
domain
of
the
state
which
was
built
up
not
on
individuals
or
castes
but
on
common
human
qualities
in
the
structure
of
the
state
the
greeks
show
that
wonderful
sense
for
typical
facts
which
later
on
enabled
them
to
become
investigators
of
nature
historians
geographers
and
philosophers
it
was
not
a
limited
moral
law
of
priests
or
castes
which
had
to
decide
about
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
state
worship
but
the
most
comprehensive
view
of
the
reality
of
all
that
is
human
whence
do
the
greeks
derive
this
freedom
this
sense
of
reality
perhaps
from
homer
and
the
poets
who
preceded
him
for
just
those
poets
whose
nature
is
generally
not
the
most
wise
or
just
possess
in
compensation
that
delight
in
reality
and
activity
of
every
kind
and
prefer
not
to
deny
even
evil
it
suffices
for
them
if
evil
moderates
itself
does
not
kill
or
inwardly
poison
other
words
they
have
similar
ideas
to
those
of
the
founders
of
greek
constitutions
and
were
their
teachers
and
forerunners
exceptional
greece
deep
thorough
serious
minds
were
the
exception
the
national
instinct
tended
rather
to
regard
the
serious
and
thorough
as
a
kind
of
grimace
to
borrow
forms
from
a
foreign
source
not
to
create
but
to
transform
into
the
fairest
is
greek
to
imitate
not
for
utility
but
for
artistic
illusion
ever
and
anon
to
gain
the
mastery
over
forced
seriousness
to
arrange
beautify
is
the
continual
task
from
homer
to
the
sophists
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
of
our
era
who
are
all
outward
show
pompous
speech
declamatory
gestures
and
address
themselves
to
shallow
souls
that
care
only
for
appearance
sound
and
effect
and
now
let
us
estimate
the
greatness
of
those
exceptional
greeks
who
created
science
whoever
tells
of
them
tells
the
most
heroic
story
of
the
human
mind
simplicity
not
the
first
nor
the
last
thing
in
point
of
the
history
of
religious
ideas
many
errors
about
development
and
false
gradations
are
made
in
matters
which
in
reality
are
not
consecutive
outgrowths
but
contemporary
yet
separate
phenomena
in
particular
simplicity
has
still
far
too
much
the
reputation
of
being
the
oldest
the
initial
thing
much
that
is
human
arises
by
subtraction
and
division
and
not
merely
by
doubling
addition
and
instance
men
still
believe
in
a
gradual
development
of
the
idea
of
god
from
those
unwieldy
stones
and
blocks
of
wood
up
to
the
highest
forms
of
anthropomorphism
yet
the
fact
is
that
so
long
as
divinity
was
attributed
to
and
felt
in
trees
logs
of
wood
stones
and
beasts
people
shrank
from
humanising
their
forms
as
from
an
act
of
godlessness
first
of
all
poets
apart
from
all
considerations
of
cult
and
the
ban
of
religious
shame
have
had
to
make
the
inner
imagination
of
man
accustomed
and
compliant
to
this
notion
wherever
more
pious
periods
and
phases
of
thought
gained
the
upper
hand
this
liberating
influence
of
poets
fell
into
the
background
and
sanctity
remained
after
as
before
on
the
side
of
the
monstrous
uncanny
quite
peculiarly
inhuman
and
then
much
of
what
the
inner
imagination
ventures
to
picture
to
itself
would
exert
a
painful
influence
if
externally
and
corporeally
represented
the
inner
eye
is
far
bolder
and
more
shameless
than
the
outer
whence
the
difficulty
and
to
some
extent
impossibility
of
working
epic
material
into
dramatic
form
the
religious
imagination
for
a
long
time
entirely
refuses
to
believe
in
the
identity
of
god
with
an
image
the
image
is
meant
to
fix
the
of
the
deity
actually
and
specifically
although
in
a
mysterious
and
not
altogether
intelligible
way
the
oldest
image
of
the
gods
is
meant
to
shelter
and
at
the
same
time
to
hide
the
indicate
him
but
not
to
expose
him
to
view
no
greek
really
looked
upon
his
apollo
as
a
pointed
pillar
of
wood
his
eros
as
a
lump
of
stone
these
were
symbols
which
were
intended
to
inspire
dread
of
the
manifestation
of
the
god
it
was
the
same
with
those
blocks
of
wood
out
of
which
individual
limbs
generally
in
excessive
number
were
fashioned
with
the
scantiest
of
for
instance
a
laconian
apollo
with
four
hands
and
four
ears
in
the
incomplete
symbolical
or
excessive
lies
a
terrible
sanctity
which
is
meant
to
prevent
us
from
thinking
of
anything
human
or
similar
to
humanity
it
is
not
an
embryonic
stage
of
art
in
which
such
things
are
if
they
were
not
to
speak
more
plainly
and
portray
more
sensibly
in
the
age
when
such
images
were
honoured
rather
men
are
afraid
of
just
one
speaking
out
just
as
the
cella
hides
and
conceals
in
a
mysterious
twilight
yet
not
completely
the
holy
of
holies
the
real
of
the
deity
just
as
again
the
peripteric
temple
hides
the
cella
protecting
it
from
indiscreet
eyes
as
with
a
screen
and
a
veil
yet
not
it
is
with
the
image
of
the
deity
and
at
the
same
time
the
concealment
of
the
when
outside
the
cult
in
the
profane
world
of
athletic
contest
the
joy
in
the
victor
had
risen
so
high
that
the
ripples
thus
started
reacted
upon
the
lake
of
religious
emotion
was
the
statue
of
the
victor
set
up
before
the
temple
then
the
pious
pilgrim
had
to
accustom
his
eye
and
his
soul
whether
he
would
or
no
to
the
inevitable
sight
of
human
beauty
and
so
that
the
worship
of
men
and
gods
melted
into
each
other
from
physical
and
spiritual
contact
then
too
for
the
first
time
the
fear
of
really
humanising
the
figures
of
the
gods
is
lost
and
the
mighty
arena
for
great
plastic
art
is
now
with
the
limitation
that
wherever
there
is
to
be
adoration
the
primitive
form
and
ugliness
are
carefully
preserved
and
copied
but
the
hellene
as
he
dedicates
and
makes
offerings
may
now
with
religious
sanction
indulge
in
his
delight
in
making
god
become
a
man
whither
we
must
is
not
enough
by
a
long
way
to
enable
us
to
learn
to
know
ourselves
we
need
history
for
the
past
continues
to
flow
through
us
in
a
hundred
channels
we
ourselves
are
after
all
nothing
but
our
own
sensation
at
every
moment
of
this
continued
flow
even
here
when
we
wish
to
step
down
into
the
stream
of
our
apparently
most
peculiar
and
personal
development
heraclitus
aphorism
you
can
not
step
twice
into
the
same
river
holds
is
a
piece
of
wisdom
which
has
indeed
gradually
become
trite
but
nevertheless
has
remained
as
strong
and
true
as
it
ever
was
it
is
the
same
with
the
saying
that
in
order
to
understand
history
we
must
scrutinise
the
living
remains
of
historical
periods
that
we
must
travel
as
old
herodotus
travelled
to
other
nations
especially
to
those
savage
or
races
in
regions
where
man
has
doffed
or
not
yet
donned
european
garb
for
they
are
ancient
and
firmly
established
steps
of
culture
on
which
we
can
stand
there
is
however
a
more
subtle
art
and
aim
in
travelling
which
does
not
always
necessitate
our
passing
from
place
to
place
and
going
thousands
of
miles
away
very
probably
the
last
three
centuries
in
all
their
colourings
and
refractions
of
culture
survive
even
in
our
vicinity
only
they
have
to
be
discovered
in
some
families
or
even
in
individuals
the
strata
are
still
superimposed
on
each
other
beautifully
and
perceptibly
in
other
places
there
are
dispersions
and
displacements
of
the
structure
which
are
harder
to
understand
certainly
in
remote
districts
in
less
known
mountain
valleys
circumscribed
communities
have
been
able
more
easily
to
maintain
an
admirable
pattern
of
a
far
older
sentiment
a
pattern
that
must
here
be
investigated
on
the
other
hand
it
is
improbable
that
such
discoveries
will
be
made
in
berlin
where
man
comes
into
the
world
and
sapless
he
who
after
long
practice
of
this
art
of
travel
has
become
a
argus
will
accompany
his
mean
his

egypt
and
greece
byzantium
and
rome

the
of

the
entire
past

by
another
chain
of
observation
which
can
only
be
indicated
here
and
in
the
freest
and
most
spirits
might
become
universal
direction
as
regards
all
future
humanity
balm
and
can
not
ponder
too
deeply
on
this
fact
christianity
is
the
religion
of
antiquity
grown
old
it
presupposes
degenerate
old
and
on
them
it
had
and
still
has
power
to
work
like
balm
there
are
periods
when
ears
and
eyes
are
full
of
slime
so
that
they
can
no
longer
hear
the
voice
of
reason
and
philosophy
or
see
the
wisdom
that
walks
in
bodily
shape
whether
it
bears
the
name
of
epictetus
or
of
epicurus
then
perhaps
the
erection
of
the
martyr
s
cross
and
the
trumpet
of
the
last
judgment
may
have
the
effect
of
still
inspiring
such
races
to
end
their
lives
decently
if
we
think
of
juvenal
s
rome
of
that
poisonous
toad
with
the
eyes
of
venus
we
understand
what
it
means
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
before
the
world
we
honour
the
silent
christian
community
and
are
grateful
for
its
having
stifled
the
empire
if
indeed
most
men
were
then
born
in
spiritual
slavery
with
the
sensuality
of
old
men
what
a
pleasure
to
meet
beings
who
were
more
soul
than
body
and
who
seemed
to
realise
the
greek
idea
of
the
shades
of
the
scurrying
chirping
kindly
creatures
with
a
reversion
on
the
better
life
and
therefore
so
unassuming
so
secretly
scornful
so
proudly
patient
christianity
as
the
evening
chime
of
the
antiquity
with
cracked
weary
and
yet
melodious
bell
is
balm
in
the
ears
even
to
one
who
only
now
traverses
those
centuries
historically
what
must
it
have
been
to
those
men
themselves
young
and
fresh
barbarian
nations
on
the
other
hand
christianity
is
a
poison
for
to
implant
the
teaching
of
sinfulness
and
damnation
in
the
heroic
childlike
and
animal
soul
of
the
old
germans
is
nothing
but
poisoning
an
enormous
chemical
fermentation
and
decomposition
a
medley
of
sentiments
and
judgments
a
rank
growth
of
adventurous
legend
and
hence
in
the
long
run
a
fundamental
weakening
of
such
barbarian
peoples
was
the
inevitable
result
true
without
this
weakening
what
should
we
have
left
of
greek
culture
of
the
whole
cultured
past
of
the
human
race
for
the
barbarians
untouched
by
christianity
knew
very
well
how
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
old
cultures
as
was
only
too
clearly
shown
by
the
heathen
conquerors
of
romanised
britain
thus
christianity
against
its
will
was
compelled
to
aid
in
making
the
antique
world
remains
however
a
and
the
possibility
of
a
without
this
weakening
through
the
poisoning
referred
to
would
any
of
those
fresh
germans
for
been
in
a
position
gradually
to
find
by
themselves
a
higher
a
peculiar
a
new
culture
of
which
the
most
distant
conception
would
therefore
have
been
lost
to
humanity
this
as
in
every
case
we
do
not
know
christianly
speaking
whether
god
owes
the
devil
or
the
devil
god
more
thanks
for
everything
having
turned
out
as
it
has
faith
makes
holy
and
christian
who
happened
upon
forbidden
paths
of
thought
might
well
ask
himself
on
some
occasion
whether
it
is
really
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
god
side
by
side
with
a
representative
lamb
if
faith
in
the
existence
of
these
beings
suffices
to
produce
the
same
influences
if
they
do
exist
after
all
are
they
not
superfluous
beings
for
all
that
is
given
by
the
christian
religion
to
the
human
soul
all
that
is
beneficent
consoling
and
edifying
just
as
much
as
all
that
depresses
and
crushes
emanates
from
that
faith
and
not
from
the
objects
of
that
faith
it
is
here
as
in
another
were
indeed
no
witches
but
the
terrible
effects
of
the
belief
in
witches
were
the
same
as
if
they
really
had
existed
for
all
occasions
where
the
christian
awaits
the
immediate
intervention
of
a
god
though
in
vain
for
there
is
no
god
his
religion
is
inventive
enough
to
find
subterfuges
and
reasons
for
tranquillity
in
so
far
christianity
is
an
ingenious
indeed
has
up
to
the
present
not
been
able
to
move
real
mountains
although
i
do
not
know
who
assumed
that
it
could
but
it
can
put
mountains
where
there
are
none
the
of
and
there
we
see
with
terrible
clearness
the
harlequinade
of
fortune
how
she
fastens
the
rope
on
which
she
wills
that
succeeding
centuries
should
dance
on
to
a
few
days
one
place
the
condition
and
opinions
of
one
brain
thus
the
fate
of
modern
german
history
lies
in
the
days
of
that
disputation
at
regensburg
the
peaceful
settlement
of
ecclesiastical
and
moral
affairs
without
religious
wars
or
a
and
also
the
unity
of
the
german
nation
seemed
assured
the
deep
gentle
spirit
of
contarini
hovered
for
one
moment
over
the
theological
squabble
victorious
as
representative
of
the
riper
italian
piety
reflecting
the
morning
glory
of
intellectual
freedom
but
luther
s
hard
head
full
of
suspicions
and
strange
misgivings
showed
resistance
because
justification
by
grace
appeared
to
him
greatest
motto
and
discovery
he
did
not
believe
the
phrase
in
the
mouth
of
italians
whereas
in
point
of
fact
as
is
well
known
they
had
invented
it
much
earlier
and
spread
it
throughout
italy
in
deep
silence
in
this
apparent
agreement
luther
saw
the
tricks
of
the
devil
and
hindered
the
work
of
peace
as
well
as
he
could
thereby
advancing
to
a
great
extent
the
aims
of
the
empire
s
now
in
order
to
have
a
still
stronger
idea
of
the
dreadful
farcicality
of
it
all
let
us
add
that
none
of
the
principles
about
which
men
then
disputed
in
that
of
original
sin
nor
that
of
redemption
by
proxy
nor
that
of
justification
by
in
any
way
true
or
even
has
any
connection
with
truth
that
they
are
now
all
recognised
as
incapable
of
being
discussed
yet
on
this
account
the
world
was
set
on
is
to
say
by
opinions
which
correspond
to
no
things
or
realities
whereas
as
regards
purely
philological
for
instance
that
of
the
sacramental
words
in
the
at
any
rate
is
permitted
because
in
this
case
the
truth
can
be
said
but
where
nothing
is
even
truth
has
lost
her
it
only
remains
to
be
said
that
it
is
true
these
principles
give
rise
to
sources
of
power
so
mighty
that
without
them
all
the
mills
of
the
modern
world
could
not
be
driven
with
such
force
and
it
is
primarily
a
matter
of
force
only
secondarily
of
truth
and
perhaps
not
even
secondarily
it
not
so
my
dear
friends
goethe
s
is
a
signal
exception
among
great
artists
in
that
he
did
not
live
within
the
limited
confines
of
his
real
capacity
as
if
that
must
be
the
essential
the
distinctive
the
unconditional
and
the
last
thing
in
him
and
for
all
the
world
twice
he
intended
to
possess
something
higher
than
he
really
went
astray
in
the
second
half
of
his
life
where
he
seems
quite
convinced
that
he
is
one
of
the
great
scientific
discoverers
and
illuminators
so
too
in
the
first
half
of
his
life
he
demanded
of
himself
something
higher
than
the
poetic
art
seemed
to
here
already
he
made
a
mistake
that
nature
wished
to
make
him
a
plastic
artist
was
his
inwardly
glowing
and
scorching
secret
which
finally
drove
him
to
italy
that
he
might
give
vent
to
his
mania
in
this
direction
and
make
to
it
every
possible
sacrifice
at
last
shrewd
as
he
was
and
honestly
averse
to
any
mental
perversion
in
himself
he
discovered
that
a
tricksy
elf
of
desire
had
attracted
him
to
the
belief
in
this
calling
and
that
he
must
free
himself
of
the
greatest
passion
of
his
heart
and
bid
it
farewell
the
painful
conviction
tearing
and
gnawing
at
his
vitals
that
it
was
necessary
to
bid
farewell
finds
full
expression
in
the
character
of
tasso
over
tasso
that
werther
intensified
hovers
the
premonition
of
something
worse
than
death
as
when
one
says
now
it
is
over
after
this
farewell
how
shall
i
go
on
living
without
going
mad
these
two
fundamental
errors
of
his
life
gave
goethe
in
face
of
a
purely
literary
attitude
towards
poetry
the
only
attitude
then
known
to
the
world
such
an
unembarrassed
and
apparently
almost
arbitrary
position
not
to
speak
of
the
period
when
schiller
poor
schiller
who
had
no
time
himself
and
left
no
time
to
others
drove
away
his
shy
dread
of
poetry
his
fear
of
all
literary
life
and
craftsmanship
goethe
appears
like
a
greek
who
now
and
then
visits
his
beloved
doubting
whether
she
be
not
a
goddess
to
whom
he
can
give
no
proper
name
in
all
his
poetry
one
notices
the
inspiring
neighbourhood
of
plastic
art
and
nature
the
features
of
these
figures
that
floated
before
perhaps
he
always
thought
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
metamorphoses
of
one
without
his
will
or
knowledge
the
features
of
all
the
children
of
his
art
without
the
extravagances
of
error
he
would
not
have
been
is
the
only
german
artist
in
writing
who
has
not
yet
become
out
of
because
he
desired
as
little
to
be
a
writer
as
a
german
by
vocation
travellers
and
their
travellers
we
may
distinguish
five
grades
the
first
and
lowest
grade
is
of
those
who
travel
and
are
become
really
travelled
and
are
as
it
were
blind
next
come
those
who
really
see
the
world
the
third
class
experience
the
results
of
their
seeing
the
fourth
weave
their
experience
into
their
life
and
carry
it
with
them
henceforth
lastly
there
are
some
men
of
the
highest
strength
who
as
soon
as
they
have
returned
home
must
finally
and
necessarily
work
out
in
their
lives
and
productions
all
the
things
seen
that
they
have
experienced
and
incorporated
in
these
five
species
of
travellers
all
mankind
goes
through
the
whole
pilgrimage
of
life
the
lowest
as
purely
passive
the
highest
as
those
who
act
and
live
out
their
lives
without
keeping
back
any
residue
of
inner
experiences
in
climbing
soon
as
we
climb
higher
than
those
who
hitherto
admired
us
we
appear
to
them
as
sunken
and
fallen
for
they
imagined
that
under
all
circumstances
they
were
on
the
heights
in
our
company
maybe
also
through
our
agency
measure
and
two
quite
lofty
things
measure
and
moderation
it
is
best
never
to
speak
a
few
know
their
force
and
significance
from
the
mysterious
paths
of
inner
experiences
and
conversions
they
honour
in
them
something
quite
godlike
and
are
afraid
to
speak
aloud
all
the
rest
hardly
listen
when
they
are
spoken
about
and
think
the
subjects
under
discussion
are
tedium
and
mediocrity
we
must
perhaps
except
those
who
have
once
heard
a
warning
note
from
that
realm
but
have
stopped
their
ears
against
the
sound
the
recollection
of
it
makes
them
angry
and
exasperated
humanity
of
friendship
and
if
thou
wilt
take
the
left
hand
then
i
will
go
to
the
right
that
feeling
is
the
of
humanity
in
intimate
intercourse
and
without
that
feeling
every
friendship
every
band
of
apostles
or
disciples
sooner
or
later
becomes
a
fraud
the
of
profound
thought
appear
to
themselves
in
intercourse
with
others
like
comedians
for
in
order
to
be
understood
they
must
always
simulate
superficiality
for
the
scorners
of
who
regards
human
beings
as
a
herd
and
flies
from
them
as
fast
as
he
can
will
certainly
be
caught
up
by
them
and
gored
upon
their
horns
the
main
transgression
against
the
society
he
who
gives
another
an
opportunity
of
favourably
setting
forth
his
knowledge
sentiments
and
experience
sets
himself
above
him
unless
he
is
felt
by
the
other
to
be
a
superior
being
without
limitation
he
is
guilty
of
an
attack
upon
his
vanity
while
what
he
aimed
at
was
the
gratification
of
the
other
man
s
vanity
a
long
life
of
action
distinguished
by
speeches
and
writings
gives
publicity
to
a
man
s
personality
personal
intercourse
with
him
is
generally
disappointing
on
two
grounds
firstly
one
expects
too
much
from
a
brief
period
of
intercourse
namely
all
that
the
thousand
and
one
opportunities
of
life
can
alone
bring
out
secondly
no
recognised
person
gives
himself
the
trouble
to
woo
recognition
in
individual
cases
he
is
too
careless
and
we
are
at
too
high
a
tension
two
sources
of
treat
all
men
with
equal
and
to
be
kind
without
distinction
of
persons
may
arise
as
much
from
a
profound
contempt
for
mankind
as
from
an
ingrained
love
of
humanity
the
wanderer
in
the
mountains
to
are
certain
signs
that
you
have
gone
farther
and
higher
there
is
a
freer
wider
prospect
before
you
the
air
blows
cooler
yet
milder
in
your
face
you
have
unlearned
the
folly
of
confounding
mildness
with
warmth
your
gait
is
more
firm
and
vigorous
courage
and
discretion
have
waxed
together
on
all
these
grounds
your
journey
may
now
be
more
lonely
and
in
any
case
more
perilous
than
heretofore
if
indeed
not
to
the
extent
believed
by
those
who
from
the
misty
valley
see
you
the
roamer
striding
on
the
mountains
with
the
exception
of
our
admit
that
my
head
is
set
wrong
on
my
neck
only
for
every
other
man
as
is
well
known
knows
better
than
i
what
i
should
do
or
leave
alone
the
only
one
who
can
not
help
me
is
myself
poor
beggar
are
we
not
all
like
statues
on
which
false
heads
have
been
placed
eh
dear
neighbour
no
you
just
you
are
the
exception
must
either
not
go
about
at
all
with
people
who
are
lacking
in
the
reverence
for
personalities
or
inexorably
fetter
them
beforehand
with
the
manacles
of
convention
the
wish
to
appear
conversation
with
strangers
or
acquaintances
to
express
only
selected
thoughts
to
speak
of
one
s
famous
acquaintances
and
important
experiences
and
travels
is
a
sign
that
one
is
not
proud
or
at
least
would
not
like
to
appear
proud
vanity
is
the
polite
mask
of
pride
good
good
friendship
arises
when
the
one
man
deeply
respects
the
other
more
even
than
himself
loves
him
also
though
not
so
much
as
himself
and
finally
to
facilitate
intercourse
knows
how
to
add
the
delicate
bloom
and
veneer
of
intimacy
but
at
the
same
time
wisely
refrains
from
a
true
real
intimacy
from
the
confounding
of
and
friends
as
we
change
ourselves
vitally
our
friends
who
have
not
changed
become
ghosts
of
our
own
past
their
voice
sounds
shadowy
and
dreadful
to
us
as
if
we
heard
our
own
voice
speaking
but
younger
harder
less
mellow
one
eye
and
two
same
people
whose
eyes
naturally
plead
for
favours
and
indulgences
are
accustomed
from
their
frequent
humiliations
and
cravings
for
revenge
to
assume
a
shameless
glance
as
well
the
haze
of
child
throughout
sounds
very
touching
but
is
only
the
verdict
from
the
distance
seen
and
known
close
at
hand
he
is
always
called
puerile
throughout
advantage
and
disadvantage
in
the
same
mute
perplexity
of
the
subtle
brain
is
usually
understood
by
the
as
a
silent
superiority
and
is
much
dreaded
whereas
the
perception
of
perplexity
would
produce
good
will
the
sage
giving
himself
out
to
be
a
philanthropy
of
the
sage
sometimes
makes
him
decide
to
pretend
to
be
excited
enraged
or
delighted
so
that
he
may
not
hurt
his
surroundings
by
the
coldness
and
rationality
of
his
true
nature
forcing
oneself
to
soon
as
we
note
that
any
one
in
intercourse
and
conversation
with
us
has
to
force
himself
to
attention
we
have
adequate
evidence
that
he
loves
us
not
or
loves
us
no
longer
the
way
to
a
christian
from
one
s
enemies
is
the
best
way
to
love
them
for
it
inspires
us
with
a
grateful
mood
towards
them
stratagem
of
the
importunate
man
gives
us
gold
coins
as
change
for
our
convention
coins
and
thereby
tries
to
force
us
afterwards
to
treat
our
convention
as
an
oversight
and
him
as
an
exception
reason
for
become
hostile
to
many
an
artist
or
writer
not
because
we
notice
in
the
end
that
he
has
duped
us
but
because
he
did
not
find
more
subtle
means
necessary
to
entrap
us
in
by
the
way
one
soul
approaches
another
but
by
the
way
it
separates
do
i
recognise
its
relationship
and
homogeneity
with
the
other
must
not
speak
about
our
friends
or
we
renounce
the
sentiment
of
friendship
is
often
the
sign
of
a
clumsy
modesty
which
when
taken
by
surprise
loses
its
head
and
would
fain
hide
the
fact
by
means
of
rudeness
honesty
s
newest
acquaintances
are
sometimes
the
first
to
learn
what
we
have
hitherto
kept
dark
we
have
the
foolish
notion
that
our
proof
of
confidence
is
the
strongest
fetter
wherewith
to
hold
them
fast
but
do
not
know
enough
about
us
to
feel
so
strongly
the
sacrifice
involved
in
our
speaking
out
and
betray
our
secrets
to
others
without
any
idea
of
betrayal
hereby
we
possibly
lose
our
old
friends
in
the
of
men
whom
we
let
stand
long
in
the
of
our
favour
get
into
a
state
of
fermentation
or
become
bitter
warning
to
the
we
have
sunk
unmistakably
in
the
estimation
of
mankind
we
should
cling
tooth
and
nail
to
modesty
in
intercourse
or
we
shall
betray
to
others
that
we
have
sunk
in
our
own
estimation
as
well
cynicism
in
intercourse
is
a
sign
that
a
man
when
alone
treats
himself
too
as
a
dog
ignorance
often
regard
to
the
respect
of
those
who
pay
respect
it
is
an
advantage
ostensibly
not
to
understand
certain
things
ignorance
too
confers
privileges
the
opponent
of
impatient
and
arrogant
man
does
not
care
for
grace
feeling
it
to
be
a
corporeal
visible
reproach
against
himself
for
grace
is
heartfelt
toleration
in
movement
and
gesture
on
seeing
old
friends
see
each
other
again
after
a
long
separation
it
often
happens
that
they
affect
an
interest
in
matters
to
which
they
have
long
since
become
indifferent
sometimes
both
remark
this
but
dare
not
raise
the
a
mournful
doubt
hence
arise
conversations
as
in
the
realm
of
the
dead
making
friends
only
with
the
man
of
leisure
is
dangerous
to
his
friends
for
having
nothing
to
do
he
talks
of
what
his
friends
are
doing
or
not
doing
interferes
and
finally
makes
himself
a
nuisance
the
clever
man
will
only
make
friends
with
the
industrious
one
weapon
twice
as
much
as
is
an
unequal
combat
when
one
man
defends
his
cause
with
head
and
heart
the
other
with
head
alone
the
first
has
sun
and
wind
against
him
as
it
were
and
his
two
weapons
interfere
with
each
other
he
loses
the
the
eyes
of
truth
true
the
victory
of
the
second
with
his
one
weapon
is
seldom
a
victory
after
the
hearts
of
all
the
other
spectators
and
makes
him
unpopular
depth
and
troubled
public
easily
confounds
him
who
fishes
in
troubled
waters
with
him
who
pumps
up
from
the
depths
demonstrating
one
s
vanity
to
friend
and
a
man
from
vanity
maltreats
even
his
friends
when
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
to
whom
he
wishes
to
make
his
own
preponderance
clear
others
exaggerate
the
merits
of
their
enemies
in
order
to
point
proudly
to
the
fact
that
they
are
worthy
of
such
foes
cooling
of
the
heart
is
generally
allied
with
illness
of
the
head
and
judgment
he
who
is
concerned
for
a
time
with
the
health
of
his
head
must
know
what
he
has
to
cool
careless
of
the
future
of
his
heart
for
if
we
are
capable
at
all
of
giving
warmth
we
are
sure
to
become
warm
again
and
then
have
our
summer
mingled
science
women
and
artists
entertain
a
feeling
that
is
composed
of
envy
and
sentimentality
where

the
danger

when

to
take
things
easily
and
choose
the
convenient
paths
not
too
must
beware
of
becoming
sharp
too
early

we
shall
also

him
the
experiment
of
men
who
wish
to
be
more
honest
than
they
have
been
seek
as
victim
some
one
acknowledged
to
be
honest
attacking
him
first
with
an
attempt
to
reach
his
height
by
the
underlying
notion
that
this
first
experiment
at
any
rate
is
void
of
danger
for
just
such
a
one
has
no
right
to
chastise
the
impudence
of
the
honest
man
the
eternal
think
that
we
are
that
and
games
belong
to
childhood
as
if
at
any
age
we
should
care
to
live
without
and
games
our
words
and
sentiments
are
indeed
different
but
the
essential
fact
remains
the
same
as
is
proved
by
the
child
himself
looking
on
games
as
his
work
and
as
his
truth
the
shortness
of
life
ought
to
preserve
us
from
a
pedantic
distinction
between
the
different
if
every
age
brought
something
a
poet
ought
one
day
to
portray
a
man
of
two
hundred
who
really
lives
without
and
games
every
philosophy
is
the
philosophy
of
a
period
of
period
of
life
in
which
a
philosopher
finds
his
teaching
is
manifested
by
his
teaching
he
can
not
avoid
that
however
elevated
above
time
and
hour
he
may
feel
himself
thus
schopenhauer
s
philosophy
remains
a
mirror
of
his
hot
and
melancholy
is
no
mode
of
thought
for
older
men
plato
s
philosophy
reminds
one
of
the
middle
thirties
when
a
warm
and
a
cold
current
generally
rush
together
so
that
spray
and
delicate
clouds
and
under
favourable
circumstances
and
glimpses
of
sunshine
enchanting
result
of
the
intellect
of
intellectual
strength
of
a
woman
is
best
proved
by
the
fact
that
she
offers
her
own
intellect
as
a
sacrifice
out
of
love
for
a
man
and
his
intellect
and
that
nevertheless
in
the
new
domain
which
was
previously
foreign
to
her
nature
a
second
intellect
at
once
arises
as
an
aftergrowth
to
which
the
man
s
mind
impels
her
raising
and
lowering
in
the
sexual
storm
of
desire
will
sometimes
carry
a
man
up
to
a
height
where
all
desire
is
silenced
where
he
really
loves
and
lives
in
a
better
state
of
being
rather
than
in
a
better
state
of
choice
on
the
other
hand
a
good
woman
from
true
love
often
climbs
down
to
desire
and
lowers
herself
in
her
own
eyes
the
latter
action
in
particular
is
one
of
the
most
pathetic
sensations
which
the
idea
of
a
good
marriage
can
involve
man
promises
woman
woman
nature
shows
how
far
she
has
hitherto
achieved
her
task
of
fashioning
humanity
by
man
she
shows
what
she
has
had
to
overcome
and
what
she
still
proposes
to
do
for
most
perfect
woman
of
every
age
is
the
of
the
creator
on
every
seventh
day
of
culture
the
recreation
of
the
artist
from
his
work
we
have
spent
our
intellect
in
order
to
gain
mastery
over
the
intemperance
of
the
passions
the
sad
result
often
follows
that
we
transfer
the
intemperance
to
the
intellect
and
from
that
time
forth
are
extravagant
in
thought
and
desire
of
knowledge
laughter
as
and
when
a
woman
laughs
is
a
sign
of
her
culture
but
in
the
ring
of
laughter
her
nature
reveals
itself
and
in
highly
cultured
women
perhaps
even
the
last
insoluble
residue
of
their
nature
hence
the
psychologist
will
say
with
horace
though
from
different
reasons
ridete
from
the
youthful
varyingly
show
devotion
and
impudence
towards
the
same
person
because
at
bottom
they
only
despise
or
admire
themselves
in
that
other
person
and
between
the
two
feelings
but
stagger
to
and
fro
in
themselves
so
long
as
they
have
not
found
in
experience
the
measure
of
their
will
and
ability
for
the
amelioration
of
the
we
forbade
the
discontented
the
sullen
and
the
atrabilious
to
propagate
we
might
transform
the
world
into
a
garden
of
aphorism
belongs
to
a
practical
philosophy
for
the
female
sex
not
to
distrust
your
feminine
phrase
do
not
distrust
your
emotions
does
not
mean
much
more
than
eat
what
tastes
good
to
this
may
also
especially
for
moderate
natures
be
a
good
everyday
rule
but
other
natures
must
live
according
to
another
maxim
you
must
eat
not
only
with
your
mouth
but
also
with
your
brain
in
order
that
the
greediness
of
your
mouth
may
not
prove
your
a
cruel
fancy
of
great
love
involves
the
cruel
thought
of
killing
the
object
of
love
so
that
it
may
be
removed
once
for
all
from
the
mischievous
play
of
change
for
love
is
more
afraid
of
change
than
of
destruction
everything
that
is
learnt
or
experienced
the
child
just
like
the
man
sees
doors
but
for
the
former
they
are
places
to
go
for
the
latter
to
go
sympathetic
sympathy
of
women
which
is
talkative
takes
the
to
market
early
who
acquires
merit
early
in
life
tends
to
forget
all
reverence
for
age
and
old
people
and
accordingly
greatly
to
his
disadvantage
excludes
himself
from
the
society
of
the
mature
those
who
confer
maturity
thus
in
spite
of
his
early
merit
he
remains
green
importunate
and
boyish
longer
than
others
souls
all
of
a
and
artists
think
that
where
we
do
not
contradict
them
we
can
not
reverence
on
ten
counts
and
silent
disapproval
on
ten
others
appears
to
them
an
impossible
combination
because
their
souls
are
all
of
a
piece
young
respect
to
young
talents
we
must
strictly
follow
goethe
s
maxim
that
we
should
often
avoid
harming
error
in
order
to
avoid
harming
truth
their
condition
is
like
the
diseases
of
pregnancy
and
involves
strange
appetites
these
appetites
should
be
satisfied
and
humoured
as
far
as
possible
for
the
sake
of
the
fruit
they
may
be
expected
to
produce
it
is
true
that
as
nurse
of
these
remarkable
invalids
one
must
learn
the
difficult
art
of
voluntary
disgust
with
are
so
constituted
that
all
truth
in
relation
to
men
love
children
society
aim
of
life
disgusts
that
they
try
to
be
revenged
on
every
one
who
opens
their
eyes
the
source
of
great
arises
the
sudden
passion
of
a
man
for
a
woman
a
passion
so
deep
so
vital
least
of
all
from
sensuality
only
but
when
a
man
finds
weakness
need
of
help
and
high
spirits
united
in
the
same
creature
he
suffers
a
sort
of
overflowing
of
soul
and
is
touched
and
offended
at
the
same
moment
at
this
point
arises
the
source
of
great
love
the
child
the
sense
for
cleanliness
should
be
fanned
into
a
passion
and
then
later
on
he
will
raise
himself
in
ever
new
phases
to
almost
every
virtue
and
will
finally
appear
in
compensation
for
all
talent
as
a
shining
cloud
of
purity
temperance
gentleness
and
character
happy
in
himself
and
spreading
happiness
around
of
vain
old
of
thought
belongs
to
youth
clarity
of
thought
to
old
age
when
in
spite
of
this
old
men
sometimes
speak
and
write
in
the
manner
of
the
profound
they
do
so
from
vanity
imagining
that
they
thereby
assume
the
charm
of
juvenility
enthusiasm
growth
apprehensiveness
hopefulness
enjoyment
of
use
a
new
lesson
or
experience
later
on
as
a
ploughshare
or
perhaps
also
as
a
weapon
women
at
once
make
it
into
an
ornament
how
both
sexes
behave
when
in
the
it
is
conceded
to
a
woman
that
she
is
right
she
can
not
deny
herself
the
triumph
of
setting
her
heel
on
the
neck
of
the
vanquished
she
must
taste
her
victory
to
the
full
on
the
other
hand
man
towards
man
in
such
a
case
is
ashamed
of
being
right
but
then
man
is
accustomed
to
victory
with
woman
it
is
an
exception
abnegation
in
the
will
to
order
to
become
beautiful
a
woman
must
not
desire
to
be
considered
pretty
that
is
to
say
in
out
of
a
hundred
cases
where
she
could
please
she
must
scorn
and
put
aside
all
thoughts
of
pleasing
only
then
can
she
ever
reap
the
delight
of
him
whose
soul
s
portal
is
wide
enough
to
admit
the
great
unintelligible
youth
can
not
understand
that
an
old
man
has
also
had
his
delights
his
dawns
of
feeling
his
changings
and
soarings
of
thought
it
offends
him
to
think
that
such
things
have
existed
before
but
it
makes
him
very
bitter
to
hear
that
to
become
fruitful
he
must
lose
those
buds
and
dispense
with
their
fragrance
the
party
with
the
air
of
party
that
can
assume
an
air
of
martyrdom
wins
souls
over
to
its
side
and
thereby
itself
acquires
an
air
of
good
to
its
advantage
assertions
surer
than
assertion
has
with
the
majority
of
men
at
any
rate
more
effect
than
an
argument
for
arguments
provoke
mistrust
hence
demagogues
seek
to
strengthen
the
arguments
of
their
party
by
assertions
the
best
regularly
successful
men
are
profoundly
cunning
in
making
their
faults
and
weaknesses
look
like
manifestations
of
strength
this
proves
that
they
must
know
their
defects
uncommonly
well
from
time
to
sat
in
the
city
gateway
and
said
to
one
who
passed
through
that
this
was
the
city
gate
the
latter
replied
that
this
was
true
but
that
one
must
not
be
too
much
in
the
right
if
one
expected
to
be
thanked
for
it
oh
answered
the
other
i
don
t
want
thanks
but
from
time
to
time
it
is
very
pleasant
not
merely
to
be
in
the
right
but
to
remain
in
the
virtue
was
not
invented
by
the
s
nobleness
and
freedom
from
envy
beethoven
s
fine
hermitical
resignation
mozart
s
cheerfulness
and
grace
of
heart
handel
s
unbending
manliness
and
freedom
under
the
law
bach
s
confident
and
luminous
inner
life
such
as
does
not
even
need
to
renounce
glamour
and
these
qualities
peculiarly
german
they
are
not
they
at
least
prove
to
what
goal
germans
should
strive
and
to
what
they
can
attain
or
something
hope
i
am
mistaken
but
i
think
that
in
germany
of
a
twofold
sort
of
hypocrisy
is
set
up
as
the
duty
of
the
moment
for
every
one
from
misgivings
germanism
is
demanded
and
from
social
apprehensions
both
only
in
words
and
gestures
and
particularly
in
ability
to
keep
silent
it
is
the
veneer
that
nowadays
costs
so
much
and
is
paid
for
so
highly
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
spectators
the
face
of
the
nation
assumes
german
and
christian
wrinkles
how
far
even
in
the
good
the
half
may
be
more
than
the
all
things
that
are
constructed
to
last
and
demand
the
service
of
many
hands
much
that
is
less
good
must
be
made
a
rule
although
the
organiser
knows
what
is
better
and
harder
very
well
he
will
calculate
that
there
will
never
be
a
lack
of
persons
who
correspond
to
the
rule
and
he
knows
that
the
middling
good
is
the
youth
seldom
sees
this
point
and
as
an
innovator
thinks
how
marvellously
he
is
in
the
right
and
how
strange
is
the
blindness
of
others
the
true
partisan
learns
nothing
more
he
only
experiences
and
judges
it
is
significant
that
solon
who
was
never
a
partisan
but
pursued
his
aims
above
and
apart
from
parties
or
even
against
them
was
the
father
of
that
simple
phrase
wherein
lies
the
secret
of
the
health
and
vitality
of
athens
i
grow
old
but
i
am
always
what
is
german
according
to
are
really
intolerable
people
of
whom
one
can
not
even
accept
the
good
who
have
freedom
of
disposition
but
do
not
remark
that
they
are
lacking
in
freedom
of
taste
and
spirit
yet
just
this
according
to
goethe
s
judgment
is
voice
and
his
example
indicate
that
the
german
should
be
more
than
a
german
if
he
wishes
to
be
useful
or
even
endurable
to
other
which
direction
his
striving
should
take
in
order
that
he
may
rise
above
and
beyond
himself
when
it
is
necessary
to
remain
the
masses
begin
to
rage
and
reason
is
under
a
cloud
it
is
a
good
thing
if
the
health
of
one
s
soul
is
not
quite
assured
to
go
under
a
doorway
and
look
out
to
see
what
the
weather
is
like
the
and
the
only
remedy
against
socialism
that
still
lies
in
your
power
is
to
avoid
provoking
other
words
to
live
in
moderation
and
contentment
to
prevent
as
far
as
possible
all
lavish
display
and
to
aid
the
state
as
far
as
possible
in
its
taxing
of
all
superfluities
and
luxuries
you
do
not
like
this
remedy
then
you
rich
bourgeois
who
call
yourselves
liberals
confess
that
it
is
your
own
inclination
that
you
find
so
terrible
and
menacing
in
socialists
but
allow
to
prevail
in
yourselves
as
unavoidable
as
if
with
you
it
were
something
different
as
you
are
constituted
if
you
had
not
your
fortune
and
the
cares
of
maintaining
it
this
bent
of
yours
would
make
socialists
of
you
possession
alone
differentiates
you
from
them
if
you
wish
to
conquer
the
assailants
of
your
prosperity
you
must
first
conquer
if
that
prosperity
only
meant
it
would
not
be
so
external
and
provocative
of
envy
it
would
be
more
generous
more
benevolent
more
compensatory
more
helpful
but
the
spurious
histrionic
element
in
your
pleasures
which
lie
more
in
the
feeling
of
contrast
because
others
have
them
not
and
feel
envious
than
in
feelings
of
realised
and
heightened
houses
dresses
carriages
shops
the
demands
of
your
palates
and
your
tables
your
noisy
operatic
and
musical
enthusiasm
lastly
your
women
formed
and
fashioned
but
of
base
metal
gilded
but
without
the
ring
of
gold
chosen
by
you
for
show
and
considering
themselves
meant
for
are
the
things
that
spread
the
poison
of
that
national
disease
which
seizes
the
masses
ever
more
and
more
as
a
socialistic
but
has
its
origin
and
in
you
who
shall
now
arrest
this
epidemic
party
a
party
observes
that
a
previous
member
has
changed
from
an
unqualified
to
a
qualified
adherent
it
endures
it
so
ill
that
it
irritates
and
mortifies
him
in
every
possible
way
with
the
object
of
forcing
him
to
a
decisive
break
and
making
him
an
opponent
for
the
party
suspects
that
the
intention
of
finding
a
relative
value
in
its
faith
a
value
which
admits
of
pro
and
con
of
weighing
and
discarding
is
more
dangerous
than
downright
opposition
for
the
strengthening
of
wishes
to
strengthen
a
party
internally
should
give
it
an
opportunity
of
being
forcibly
treated
with
obvious
injustice
the
party
thus
acquires
a
capital
of
good
conscience
which
hitherto
it
perhaps
lacked
to
provide
for
one
s
men
after
all
only
respect
the
and
slowly
developed
he
who
would
survive
after
his
death
must
not
only
provide
for
posterity
but
still
more
for
the
past
hence
tyrants
of
every
sort
including
tyrannical
artists
and
politicians
like
to
do
violence
to
history
so
that
history
may
seem
a
preparation
and
a
ladder
up
to
them
party
beating
of
drums
which
delights
young
writers
who
serve
a
party
sounds
to
him
who
does
not
belong
to
the
party
like
a
rattling
of
chains
and
excites
sympathy
rather
than
admiration
taking
sides
against
followers
never
forgive
us
for
taking
sides
against
ourselves
for
we
seem
in
their
eyes
not
only
to
be
spurning
their
love
but
to
be
exposing
them
to
the
charge
of
lack
of
intelligence
danger
in
a
man
of
intellect
should
hold
property
otherwise
property
is
dangerous
to
the
community
for
the
owner
not
knowing
how
to
make
use
of
the
leisure
which
his
possessions
might
secure
to
him
will
continue
to
strive
after
more
property
this
strife
will
be
his
occupation
his
strategy
in
the
war
with
ennui
so
in
the
end
real
wealth
is
produced
from
the
moderate
property
that
would
be
enough
for
an
intellectual
man
such
wealth
then
is
the
glittering
outcrop
of
intellectual
dependence
and
poverty
but
it
looks
quite
different
from
what
its
humble
origin
might
lead
one
to
expect
because
it
can
mask
itself
with
culture
and
can
in
fact
purchase
the
mask
hence
it
excites
envy
in
the
poor
and
at
bottom
always
envy
culture
and
see
no
mask
in
the
gradually
paves
the
way
for
a
social
revolution
for
a
gilded
coarseness
and
a
histrionic
blowing
of
trumpets
in
the
pretended
enjoyment
of
culture
inspires
that
class
with
the
thought
it
is
only

socialistic

are
nowadays
becoming

more

rather
than
terrifying
to
the
dynastic

by

they

for

nailed

incorporated
with
the
quite
in
conflict
with
his
real
and
essential
needs
of
the
mastery
of
them
that
is
easy
ridiculously
easy
to
set
up
a
model
for
the
choice
of
a
legislative
body
first
of
all
the
honest
and
reliable
men
of
the
nation
who
at
the
same
time
are
masters
and
experts
in
some
one
branch
have
to
become
prominent
by
mutual
and
recognition
from
these
by
a
narrower
process
of
selection
the
learned
and
expert
of
the
first
rank
in
each
individual
branch
must
again
be
chosen
also
by
mutual
recognition
and
guarantee
if
the
legislative
body
be
composed
of
these
it
will
finally
be
necessary
in
each
individual
case
that
only
the
voices
and
judgments
of
the
most
specialised
experts
should
decide
the
honesty
of
all
the
rest
should
have
become
so
great
that
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
decency
to
leave
the
voting
also
in
the
hands
of
these
men
the
result
would
be
that
the
law
in
the
strictest
sense
would
emanate
from
the
intelligence
of
the
most
things
now
are
voting
is
done
by
parties
and
at
every
division
there
must
be
hundreds
of
uneasy
consciences
among
the
the
incapable
of
judgment
among
those
who
merely
repeat
imitate
and
go
with
the
tide
nothing
lowers
the
dignity
of
a
new
law
so
much
as
this
inherent
shamefaced
feeling
of
insincerity
that
necessarily
results
at
every
party
division
but
as
has
been
said
it
is
easy
ridiculously
easy
to
set
up
such
a
model
no
power
on
earth
is
at
present
strong
enough
to
realise
such
an
the
belief
in
the
highest
utility
of
knowledge
and
of
those
that
know
at
last
dawns
even
upon
the
most
hostile
minds
and
is
preferred
to
the
prevalent
belief
in
majorities
in
the
sense
of
such
a
future
may
our
watchword
be
more
reverence
for
them
that
know
and
down
with
all
parties
of
the
nation
of
thinkers
or
of
bad
thinking
vague
vacillating
premonitory
elementary

obscure
names
for
obscure
are
attributed
to
the
german
nature
would
be
if
they
really
still
existed
a
proof
that
our
culture
has
remained
several
stages
behind
and
is
still
surrounded
by
the
spell
and
atmosphere
of
the
middle
is
true
that
in
this
backwardness
there
are
certain
advantages
by
these
qualities
the
germans
if
as
has
been
said
before
they
still
possess
them
would
possess
the
capacity
which
other
nations
have
now
lost
for
doing
certain
things
and
particularly
for
understanding
certain
things
much
undoubtedly
is
lost
if
the
lack
of
is
just
the
common
factor
in
all
those
lost
here
too
however
there
are
no
losses
without
the
highest
compensatory
gains
so
that
no
reason
is
left
for
lamenting
granting
that
we
do
not
like
children
and
gourmands
wish
to
enjoy
at
once
the
fruits
of
all
seasons
of
the
year
carrying
coals
to
governments
of
the
great
states
have
two
instruments
for
keeping
the
people
dependent
in
fear
and
obedience
a
coarser
the
army
and
a
more
refined
the
school
with
the
aid
of
the
former
they
win
over
to
their
side
the
ambition
of
the
higher
strata
and
the
strength
of
the
lower
so
far
as
both
are
characteristic
of
active
and
energetic
men
of
moderate
or
inferior
gifts
with
the
aid
of
the
latter
they
win
over
gifted
poverty
especially
the
intellectually
pretentious
of
the
middle
classes
above
all
they
make
teachers
of
all
grades
into
an
intellectual
court
looking
unconsciously
towards
the
by
putting
obstacle
after
obstacle
in
the
way
of
private
schools
and
the
wholly
distasteful
individual
tuition
they
secure
the
disposal
of
a
considerable
number
of
educational
posts
towards
which
numerous
hungry
and
submissive
eyes
are
turned
to
an
extent
five
times
as
great
as
can
ever
be
satisfied
these
posts
however
must
support
the
holder
but
meagrely
so
that
he
maintains
a
feverish
thirst
for
promotion
and
becomes
still
more
closely
attached
to
the
views
of
the
government
for
it
is
always
more
advantageous
to
foster
moderate
discontent
than
contentment
the
mother
of
courage
the
grandmother
of
free
thought
and
exuberance
by
means
of
this
physically
and
mentally
bridled
body
of
teachers
the
youth
of
the
country
is
as
far
as
possible
raised
to
a
certain
level
of
culture
that
is
useful
to
the
state
and
arranged
on
a
suitable
above
all
the
immature
and
ambitious
minds
of
all
classes
are
almost
imperceptibly
imbued
with
the
idea
that
only
a
career
which
is
recognised
and
by
the
state
can
lead
immediately
to
social
distinction
the
effect
of
this
belief
in
government
examinations
and
titles
goes
so
far
that
even
men
who
have
remained
independent
and
have
risen
by
trade
or
handicraft
still
feel
a
pang
of
discontent
in
their
hearts
until
their
position
too
is
marked
and
acknowledged
by
a
gracious
bestowal
of
rank
and
orders
from
one
becomes
a
finally
the
state
connects
all
these
hundreds
of
offices
and
posts
in
its
hands
with
the
obligation
of
being
trained
and
hallmarked
in
these
state
schools
if
one
ever
wishes
to
enter
this
charmed
circle
honour
in
society
daily
bread
the
possibility
of
a
family
protection
from
above
the
feeling
of
community
in
a
common
this
forms
a
network
of
hopes
into
which
every
young
man
walks
how
should
he
feel
the
slightest
breath
of
mistrust
in
the
end
perhaps
the
obligation
of
being
a
soldier
for
one
year
has
become
with
every
one
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
generations
an
unreflecting
habit
an
understood
thing
with
an
eye
to
which
we
construct
the
plan
of
our
lives
quite
early
then
the
state
can
venture
on
the
of
weaving
together
school
and
army
talent
ambition
and
strength
by
means
of
common
is
by
attracting
the
more
highly
gifted
on
favourable
terms
to
the
army
and
inspiring
them
with
the
military
spirit
of
joyful
obedience
so
that
finally
perhaps
they
become
attached
permanently
to
the
flag
and
endow
it
by
their
talents
with
an
ever
new
and
more
brilliant
lustre
then
nothing
more
is
wanted
but
an
opportunity
for
great
wars
these
are
provided
from
professional
reasons
and
so
in
all
innocence
by
diplomats
aided
by
newspapers
and
stock
exchanges
for
the
nation
as
a
nation
of
soldiers
need
never
be
supplied
with
a
good
conscience
in
has
one
already
the
we
consider
how
even
all
great
political
transactions
glide
upon
the
stage
secretly
and
stealthily
how
they
are
hidden
by
unimportant
events
and
seem
small
when
close
at
hand
how
they
only
show
their
effect
and
leave
the
soil
still
quaking
long
after
they
have
taken
place
significance
can
we
attach
to
the
press
in
its
present
position
with
its
daily
expenditure
of
in
order
to
bawl
to
deafen
to
excite
to
terrify
is
it
anything
more
than
an
everlasting
false
alarm
which
tries
to
lead
our
ears
and
our
wits
into
a
false
direction
after
a
great
nation
and
a
man
whose
soul
has
come
to
light
through
some
great
event
generally
feel
the
immediate
need
of
some
act
of
childishness
or
coarseness
as
much
from
shame
as
for
purposes
of
recreation
to
be
a
good
german
means
to
differences
consist
far
more
than
has
hitherto
been
observed
only
in
the
differences
of
various
grades
of
culture
and
are
only
to
a
very
small
extent
permanent
nor
even
that
in
a
strict
sense
for
this
reason
all
arguments
based
on
national
character
are
so
little
binding
on
one
who
aims
at
the
alteration
of
other
words
at
culture
if
for
instance
we
consider
all
that
has
already
been
german
we
shall
improve
upon
the
hypothetical
question
what
is
german
by
the
what
is
german
and
every
good
german
will
answer
it
practically
by
overcoming
his
german
characteristics
for
when
a
nation
advances
and
grows
it
bursts
the
girdle
previously
given
to
it
by
its
national
outlook
when
it
remains
stationary
or
declines
its
soul
is
surrounded
by
a
fresh
girdle
and
the
crust
as
it
becomes
harder
and
harder
builds
a
prison
around
with
walls
growing
ever
higher
hence
if
a
nation
has
much
that
is
firmly
established
this
is
a
sign
that
it
wishes
to
petrify
and
would
like
to
become
nothing
but
a
monument
this
happened
from
a
definite
date
in
the
case
of
egypt
so
he
who
is
towards
the
germans
may
for
his
part
consider
how
he
may
more
and
more
grow
out
of
what
is
german
the
tendency
to
be
has
therefore
always
been
a

and
as
the
poet
says
include
the
godhead
in
our
will
but
the
beautiful
we
must
not
will
we
must
be
capable
of
it
in
innocence
and
blindness
without
any
psychical
curiosity
he
that
lights
his
lantern
to
find
perfect
men
should
remember
the
token
by
which
to
know
them
they
are
the
men
who
always
act
for
the
sake
of
the
good
and
in
so
doing
always
attain
to
the
beautiful
without
thinking
of
the
beautiful
many
better
and
nobler
men
from
impotence
or
from
want
of
beauty
in
their
souls
remain
unrefreshing
and
ugly
to
behold
with
all
their
good
will
and
good
works
they
rebuff
and
injure
even
virtue
through
the
repulsive
garb
in
which
their
bad
taste
arrays
her
danger
of
must
beware
of
basing
our
lives
on
too
narrow
a
foundation
of
appetite
for
if
we
renounce
all
the
joys
involved
in
positions
honours
associations
revels
creature
comforts
and
arts
a
day
may
come
when
we
perceive
that
this
repudiation
has
led
us
not
to
wisdom
but
to
satiety
of
life
final
opinion
on
we
should
hide
our
opinions
or
hide
ourselves
behind
our
opinions
whoever
does
otherwise
does
not
know
the
way
of
the
world
or
belongs
to
the
order
of
pious
must
contain
edifying
and
healing
forces
for
the
moral
nature
of
man
otherwise
how
comes
it
that
our
soul
as
soon
as
it
basks
in
the
sunshine
of
joy
unconsciously
vows
to
itself
i
will
be
good
i
will
become
perfect
and
is
at
once
seized
by
a
premonition
of
perfection
that
is
like
a
shudder
of
religious
awe
to
one
who
is
long
as
you
are
praised
believe
that
you
are
not
yet
on
your
own
course
but
on
that
of
another
loving
the
apprentice
and
the
master
love
the
master
in
different
ways
and
nature
is
too
beautiful
for
thee
poor
mortal
one
often
feels
but
now
and
then
at
a
profound
contemplation
of
all
that
is
human
in
its
fulness
vigour
tenderness
and
complexity
i
have
felt
as
if
i
must
say
in
all
humility
man
also
is
too
beautiful
for
the
contemplation
of
man
nor
did
i
mean
the
moral
man
alone
but
every
one
real
and
personal
life
has
treated
us
in
true
robber
fashion
and
has
taken
away
all
that
it
could
of
honour
joys
connections
health
and
property
of
every
kind
we
perhaps
discover
in
the
end
after
the
first
shock
that
we
are
richer
than
before
for
now
we
know
for
the
first
time
what
is
so
peculiarly
ours
that
no
robber
hand
can
touch
it
and
perhaps
after
all
the
plunder
and
devastation
we
come
forward
with
the
airs
of
a
mighty
real
estate
owner
involuntarily
most
painful
feeling
that
exists
is
finding
out
that
we
are
always
taken
for
something
higher
than
we
really
are
for
we
must
thereby
confess
to
ourselves
there
is
in
you
some
element
of
speech
your
expression
your
bearing
your
eye
your
dealings
and
this
deceitful
something
is
as
necessary
as
your
usual
honesty
but
constantly
destroys
its
effect
and
its
idealist
and
must
not
let
ourselves
be
tyrannised
even
by
that
finest
faculty
of
idealising
things
otherwise
truth
will
one
day
part
company
from
us
with
the
insulting
remark
thou
what
have
i
to
do
with
thee
being
one
is
misunderstood
generally
it
is
impossible
to
remove
a
particular
misunderstanding
this
point
must
be
recognised
to
save
superfluous
expenditure
of
energy
in
the
on
drinking
your
wine
which
has
refreshed
you
all
your
affair
is
it
of
yours
if
i
have
to
be
a

not

peaceable
brotherly
elements
that
can
live
side
by
side
without
mutual
recriminations
from
cannibal
solitude
the
lonely
man
is
eaten
up
by
himself
among
crowds
by
the
many
choose
which
you
prefer
the
of
the
some
time
the
hour
will
come
at
last
the
hour
that
will
envelop
you
in
the
golden
cloud
of
painlessness
when
the
soul
enjoys
its
own
weariness
and
happy
in
patient
playing
with
patience
resembles
the
waves
of
a
lake
which
on
a
quiet
summer
day
in
the
reflection
of
a
evening
sky
sip
and
sip
at
the
shore
and
again
are
end
without
purpose
without
satiety
without
calm
rejoicing
in
change
all
ebb
and
flow
of
nature
s
such
is
the
feeling
and
talk
of
all
invalids
but
if
they
attain
that
hour
a
brief
period
of
enjoyment
is
followed
by
ennui
but
this
is
the
of
the
frozen
will
which
awakes
stirs
and
once
more
begets
desire
upon
is
a
sign
of
convalescence
or
recovery
the
disclaimed
happens
sometimes
by
an
exception
that
a
man
only
reaches
the
highest
when
he
disclaims
his
ideal
for
this
ideal
previously
drove
him
onward
too
violently
so
that
in
the
middle
of
the
track
he
regularly
got
out
of
breath
and
had
to
rest
a
treacherous
should
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
an
envious
but
aspiring
man
when
he
feels
himself
attracted
by
the
thought
that
with
regard
to
the
eminent
there
is
but
one
staircase
as
the
wit
of
many
men
does
not
keep
pace
with
opportunity
so
that
opportunity
has
already
passed
through
the
door
while
wit
still
waits
on
the
staircase
outside
so
others
have
a
kind
of
staircase
happiness
which
walks
too
slowly
to
keep
pace
with
time
the
best
that
it
can
enjoy
of
an
experience
of
a
whole
span
of
life
falls
to
its
share
long
afterwards
often
only
as
a
weak
spicy
fragrance
giving
rise
to
longing
and
if
it
might
have
been
possible
time
or
drink
one
s
fill
of
this
element
but
now
it
is
too
late
fact
that
an
intellect
contains
a
few
worms
does
not
detract
from
its
ripeness
the
seat
of
good

on
horseback
robs
an
opponent
of
his
courage
the
spectator
of
his
attack
such
a
man

like
one
who
has
been
victorious
danger
in
excessive
admiration
for
the
virtues
of
others
one
can
lose
the
sense
of
one
s
own
and
finally
through
lack
of
practice
lose
these
virtues
themselves
without
retaining
the
alien
virtues
as
compensation
uses
of
who
is
often
ill
not
only
has
a
far
greater
pleasure
in
health
on
account
of
his

often

but
acquires
a
very
keen
sense
of
what
is
healthy
or
sickly
in
actions
and
achievements

his
own
and
others
thus
for
example
it
is
just
the
writers
of
uncertain
whom
unfortunately
nearly
all
great
writers
must
be
are
wont
to
have
a
far
more
even
and
assured

understand
how
to

ourselves
in
order
to
get

an
ennui

the

that
the

can

that

the
danger
in

of

of

may
be
so
strong
as
to
deter
us
from

by

but
certainly
our

after
is
only
long
after
the
death
of
a
man
that
we
find
it
inconceivable
that
he
should
be
the
case
of
really
great
men
only
after
decades
those
who
are
honest
usually
think
when
any
one
dies
that
he
is
not
much
missed
and
that
the
pompous
funeral
oration
is
a
piece
of
hypocrisy
necessity
first
teaches
the
necessariness
of
an
individual
and
the
proper
epitaph
is
a
belated
sigh
leaving

must
leave
many
things
in
the
hades
of
feeling
and
not
try
to
release
them
from

else
they

the

of
the
poor
who

who
has
thought
a
great
deal
every
new

that
he
hears
or

that

the
moment
when
one
is
beginning
to

seriously
the

that

the
reverse
imitation
the
bad

the

final
teaching
of

that

in
those
times
is
the
exclamation
of
foolish
and
frivolous
men
at
every
period
of
history
that
we
seriously
review
even
if
it
be
the
most
belauded
era
of
the
past
we
shall
rather
cry
out
at
the
end
anything
but
a
return
to
that
the
spirit
of
that
age
would
oppress
you
with
the
weight
of
a
hundred
atmospheres
the
good
and
beautiful
in
it
you
would
not
enjoy
its
evil
you
could
not
depend
upon
it
posterity
will
pass
the
same
verdict
on
our
own
epoch
and
say
that
it
was
unbearable
that
life
under
such
conditions
was
intolerable
and
yet
every
one
can
endure
his
own
times
yes
because
the
spirit
of
his
age
not
only
lies
him
but
is
him
the
spirit
of
the
age
offers
resistance
to
itself
and
can
bear
itself
greatness
as
a
greatness
in
our
comportment
we
embitter
our
foes
by
envy
that
we
do
not
conceal
we
almost
reconcile
them
to
us
for
envy
levels
and
makes
equal
it
is
an
unconscious
plaintive
variety
of
may
be
indeed
that
here
and
there
for
the
sake
of
the
advantage
envy
has
been
assumed
as
a
mask
by
those
who
are
not
envious
certainly
however
greatness
in
comportment
is
often
used
as
the
mask
of
envy
by
ambitious
men
who
would
rather
suffer
drawbacks
and
embitter
their
foes
than
let
it
be
seen
that
they
place
them
on
an
equal
footing
with
themselves
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
displaying
the
greatness
of
his
character
and
he
did
not
make
use
of
the
opportunity
he
will
never
forgive
you
for
that
most
senile
thought
ever
conceived
about
men
lies
in
the
famous
saying
the
ego
is
always
hateful
the
most
childish
in
the
still
more
famous
saying
love
thy
neighbour
as
the
one
knowledge
of
men
has
ceased
with
the
other
it
has
not
yet
begun
a
defective
we
still
belong
to
the
mob
so
long
as
we
always
shift
the
blame
on
to
others
we
are
on
the
track
of
wisdom
when
we
always
make
ourselves
alone
responsible
but
the
wise
man
finds
no
one
to
blame
neither
himself
nor
said
that
epictetus
eighteen
hundred
years

has
heard
but
forgotten
the
the
world

not

and
not

everything
is
not

but
we
had
not
the
necessary
ear
the
ear
of
he
whispered
it
into
his

ear
so
wisdom
is
the
whispering
of
the

to
himself
in

of
standpoint
not

a

paces
too
near

and
a

paces
too

from

hence
we

in
the

ourselves
too
much

and
circumstances

perhaps
sweats

at
the

on
the

yes
there
are
exquisite
fools
who
always
go
about
with
a
quiverful
of
mighty
excommunicatory
utterances
ready
to
shoot
down
any
one
who
shows
freely
that
there
are
matters
in

into

a
mistake
of

not

that

the

the

the
use

and
loftiness
of

no

is
the
glory
of
all
great
men
the
journey
to
too
have
been
in
the
underworld
even
as
odysseus
and
i
shall
often
be
there
again
not
sheep
alone
have
i
sacrificed
that
i
might
be
able
to
converse
with
a
few
dead
souls
but
not
even
my
own
blood
have
i
spared
there
were
four
pairs
who
responded
to
me
in
my
sacrifice
epicurus
and
montaigne
goethe
and
spinoza
plato
and
rousseau
pascal
and
schopenhauer
with
them
i
have
to
come
to
terms
when
i
have
long
wandered
alone
i
will
let
them
prove
me
right
or
wrong
to
them
will
i
listen
if
they
prove
each
other
right
or
wrong
in
all
that
i
say
conclude
or
think
out
for
myself
and
others
i
fasten
my
eyes
on
those
eight
and
see
their
eyes
fastened
on
the
living
forgive
me
if
i
look
upon
them
at
times
as
shadows
so
pale
and
fretful
so
restless
and
alas
so
eager
for
life
those
eight
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
me
so
living
that
i
feel
as
if
even
now
after
their
death
they
could
never
become
weary
of
life
but
eternal
vigour
of
life
is
the
important
point
what
matters
eternal
life
or
indeed
life
at
all
part
ii
the
wanderer
and
his
shadow
it
is
so
long
since
i
heard
you
speak
that
i
should
like
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
talking
i
hear
a
whose
i
almost
fancied
that
i
heard
myself
speaking
but
with
a
voice
yet
weaker
than
my
own
after
a
pause
are
you
not
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
by
god
and
everything
else
in
which
i
disbelieve
it
is
my
shadow
that
speaks
i
hear
it
but
i
do
not
believe
it
let
us
assume
that
it
exists
and
think
no
more
about
it
in
another
hour
all
will
be
over
that
is
just
what
i
thought
when
in
a
forest
near
pisa
i
saw
first
two
and
then
five
camels
it
is
all
the
better
if
we
are
both
equally
forbearing
towards
each
other
when
for
once
our
reason
is
silent
thus
we
shall
avoid
losing
our
tempers
in
conversation
and
shall
not
at
once
apply
mutual
in
the
event
of
any
word
sounding
for
once
unintelligible
to
us
if
one
does
not
know
exactly
how
to
answer
it
is
enough
to
say
those
are
the
reasonable
terms
on
which
i
hold
conversation
with
any
person
during
a
long
talk
the
wisest
of
men
becomes
a
fool
once
and
a
simpleton
thrice
your
moderation
is
not
flattering
to
those
to
whom
you
confess
it
am
i
then
to
flatter
i
thought
a
man
s
shadow
was
his
vanity
surely
vanity
would
never
say
am
i
then
to
flatter
nor
does
human
vanity
so
far
as
i
am
acquainted
with
it
ask
as
i
have
done
twice
whether
it
may
speak
it
simply
speaks
now
i
see
for
the
first
time
how
rude
i
am
to
you
my
beloved
shadow
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
my
supreme
in
hearing
and
not
merely
seeing
you
you
must
know
that
i
love
shadows
even
as
i
love
light
for
the
existence
of
beauty
of
face
clearness
of
speech
kindliness
and
firmness
of
character
the
shadow
is
as
necessary
as
the
light
they
are
not
do
they
hold
each
other
s
hands
like
good
friends
and
when
the
light
vanishes
the
shadow
glides
after
it
yes
and
i
hate
the
same
thing
that
you
i
love
men
because
they
are
votaries
of
life
i
rejoice
in
the
gleam
of
their
eyes
when
they
recognise
and
discover
they
who
never
weary
of
recognising
and
discovering
that
shadow
which
all
things
cast
when
the
sunshine
of
knowledge
falls
upon
shadow
too
am
i
i
think
i
understand
you
although
you
have
expressed
yourself
in
somewhat
shadowy
terms
you
are
right
good
friends
give
to
each
other
here
and
there
as
a
sign
of
mutual
understanding
an
obscure
phrase
which
to
any
third
party
is
meant
to
be
a
riddle
and
we
are
good
friends
you
and
i
so
enough
of
preambles
some
few
hundred
questions
oppress
my
soul
and
the
time
for
you
to
answer
them
is
perchance
but
short
let
us
see
how
we
may
come
to
an
understanding
as
quickly
and
peaceably
as
possible
but
shadows
are
more
shy
than
men
you
will
not
reveal
to
any
man
the
manner
of
our
conversation
of
our
conversation
heaven
preserve
me
from
literary
dialogues
if
plato
had
found
less
pleasure
in
spinning
them
out
his
readers
would
have
found
more
pleasure
in
plato
a
dialogue
that
in
real
life
is
a
source
of
delight
when
turned
into
writing
and
read
is
a
picture
with
nothing
but
false
perspectives
everything
is
too
long
or
too
perhaps
i
may
reveal
the
on
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
that
i
am
content
for
every
one
will
only
recognise
your
views
once
more
and
no
one
will
think
of
the
shadow
perhaps
you
are
wrong
my
friend
hitherto
they
have
observed
in
my
views
more
of
the
shadow
than
of
me
more
of
the
shadow
than
of
the
light
is
that
possible
be
serious
dear
fool
my
very
first
question
demands
seriousness
of
the
tree
of
but
no
truth
the
semblance
of
freedom
but
no
are
the
two
fruits
by
virtue
of
which
the
tree
of
knowledge
can
not
be
confounded
with
the
tree
of
life
the
world
s
the
world
is
the
abstract
essence
of
an
eternal
reasonableness
is
sufficiently
proved
by
the
fact
that
that
of
the
which
we
mean
our
human
none
too
reasonable
and
if
is
not
eternally
and
wholly
wise
and
reasonable
the
rest
of
the
world
will
not
be
so
either
here
the
conclusion
minori
ad
majus
a
parte
ad
holds
good
and
that
with
decisive
force
in
the
beginning
glorify
the
is
the
metaphysical
which
sprouts
again
at
the
contemplation
of
history
and
absolutely
makes
us
imagine
that
the
of
things
lies
all
that
is
most
valuable
and
essential
standard
for
the
value
of
difficulty
of
climbing
mountains
is
no
gauge
of
their
height
yet
in
the
case
of
science
it
is
different
are
told
by
certain
persons
who
wish
to
be
considered
the
initiated
difficulty
in
finding
truth
is
to
determine
the
value
of
truth
this
insane
morality
originates
in
the
idea
that
truths
are
really
nothing
more
than
gymnastic
appliances
with
which
we
have
to
exercise
ourselves
until
we
are
thoroughly
tired
it
is
a
morality
for
the
athletes
and
gymnasts
of
the
intellect
use
of
words
and
exists
a
simulated
contempt
for
all
the
things
that
mankind
actually
holds
most
important
for
all
everyday
matters
for
instance
we
say
we
only
eat
to
live
abominable
like
that
which
speaks
of
the
procreation
of
children
as
the
real
purpose
of
all
sexual
pleasure
conversely
the
reverence
for
the
most
important
things
is
hardly
ever
quite
genuine
the
priests
and
metaphysicians
have
indeed
accustomed
us
to
a
hypocritically
exaggerated
of
regarding
these
matters
but
they
have
not
altered
the
feeling
that
these
most
important
things
are
not
so
important
as
those
despised
everyday
a
fatal
consequence
of
this
twofold
hypocrisy
is
that
we
never
make
these
everyday
matters
such
as
eating
housing
clothes
and
intercourse
the
object
of
a
constant
unprejudiced
and
reflection
and
revision
but
as
such
a
process
appears
degrading
we
divert
from
them
our
serious
intellectual
and
artistic
side
hence
in
such
matters
habit
and
frivolity
win
an
easy
victory
over
the
thoughtless
especially
over
inexperienced
youth
on
the
other
hand
our
continual
transgressions
of
the
simplest
laws
of
body
and
mind
reduce
us
all
young
and
old
to
a
disgraceful
state
of
dependence
and
mean
to
that
fundamentally
superfluous
dependence
upon
physicians
teachers
and
clergymen
whose
still
lies
heavy
upon
the
whole
of
society
earthly
infirmities
and
their
main
we
look
about
us
we
are
always
coming
across
men
who
have
eaten
eggs
all
their
lives
without
observing
that
the
taste
the
best
who
do
not
know
that
a
is
beneficial
to
the
stomach
that
perfumes
are
most
fragrant
in
cold
clear
air
that
our
sense
of
taste
varies
in
different
parts
of
our
mouths
that
every
meal
at
which
we
talk
well
or
listen
well
does
harm
to
the
digestion
if
we
are
not
satisfied
with
these
examples
of
defective
powers
of
observation
we
shall
concede
all
the
more
readily
that
the
everyday
matters
are
very
imperfectly
seen
and
rarely
observed
by
the
majority
is
this
a
matter
of
indifference
us
remember
after
all
that
from
this
defect
are
derived
all
the
bodily
and
spiritual
of
the
individual
ignorance
of
what
is
good
and
bad
for
us
in
the
arrangement
of
our
mode
of
life
the
division
of
our
day
the
selection
of
our
friends
and
the
time
we
devote
to
them
in
business
and
leisure
commanding
and
obeying
our
feeling
for
nature
and
for
art
our
eating
sleeping
and
meditation
ignorance
and
lack
of
keen
perceptions
the
smallest
and
most
ordinary
it
is
that
makes
the
world
a
vale
of
tears
for
so
many
let
us
not
say
that
here
as
everywhere
the
fault
lies
with
human
of
reason
there
is
enough
and
to
spare
but
it
is
and
from
these
little
intimate
things
priests
and
teachers
and
the
sublime
ambition
of
all
idealists
coarser
and
subtler
din
it
even
into
the
child
s
ears
that
the
means
of
serving
mankind
at
large
depend
upon
altogether
different
the
salvation
of
the
soul
the
service
of
the
state
the
advancement
of
science
or
even
upon
social
position
and
property
whereas
the
needs
of
the
individual
his
requirements
great
and
small
during
the
hours
of
the
day
are
quite
paltry
or
socrates
attacked
with
all
his
might
this
arrogant
neglect
of
the
human
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
and
loved
to
indicate
by
a
quotation
from
homer
the
true
sphere
and
conception
of
all
anxiety
and
reflection
all
that
really
matters
he
said
is
the
good
and
evil
hap
i
find
at
two
means
of
the
of
later
antiquity
said
with
that
marvellous
insight
which
to
this
very
day
is
so
rarely
to
be
found
that
for
the
calming
of
the
spirit
the
solution
of
the
final
and
ultimate
theoretical
problems
is
by
no
means
necessary
hence
instead
of
raising
a
barren
and
remote
discussion
of
the
final
question
whether
the
gods
existed
it
sufficed
him
to
say
to
those
who
were
tormented
by
fear
of
the
gods
if
there
are
gods
they
do
not
concern
themselves
with
the
latter
position
is
far
stronger
and
more
favourable
for
by
conceding
a
few
points
to
the
other
one
makes
him
readier
to
listen
and
to
take
to
heart
but
as
soon
as
he
sets
about
proving
the
opposite
that
the
gods
do
concern
themselves
with
us
into
what
thorny
jungles
of
error
must
the
poor
man
fall
quite
of
his
own
accord
and
without
any
cunning
on
the
part
of
his
interlocutor
the
latter
must
only
have
enough
subtlety
and
humanity
to
conceal
his
sympathy
with
this
tragedy
finally
the
other
comes
to
feel
strongest
argument
against
any
with
his
own
hypothesis
he
becomes
cold
and
goes
away
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
as
the
pure
atheist
who
says
what
do
the
gods
matter
to
me
the
devil
take
them
other
cases
especially
when
a
assumption
had
cast
a
gloom
over
his
spirit
epicurus
did
not
refute
the
assumption
he
agreed
that
it
might
be
true
but
that
there
was
second
to
explain
the
same
phenomenon
and
that
it
could
perhaps
be
maintained
in
other
ways
the
plurality
of
hypotheses
for
example
that
concerning
the
origin
of
conscientious
scruples
suffices
even
in
our
time
to
remove
from
the
soul
the
shadows
that
arise
so
easily
from
pondering
over
a
hypothesis
which
is
isolated
merely
visible
and
hence
overvalued
a
whoever
wishes
to
console
the
unfortunate
the
criminal
the
hypochondriac
the
dying
may
call
to
mind
the
two
soothing
suggestions
of
epicurus
which
can
be
applied
to
a
great
number
of
problems
in
their
simplest
form
they
would
run
firstly
granted
the
thing
is
so
it
does
not
concern
us
secondly
the
thing
may
be
so
but
it
may
also
be
otherwise
in
the
soon
as
night
begins
to
fall
our
sensations
concerning
everyday
matters
are
altered
there
is
the
wind
prowling
as
if
on
forbidden
paths
whispering
as
if
in
search
of
something
fretting
because
he
can
not
find
it
there
is
the
lamplight
with
its
dim
red
glow
its
weary
look
unwillingly
fighting
against
night
a
sullen
slave
to
wakeful
man
there
are
the
breathings
of
the
sleeper
with
their
terrible
rhythm
to
which
an
care
seems
to
blow
the
do
not
hear
it
but
when
the
sleeper
s
bosom
heaves
we
feel
our
tighten
and
when
the
breath
sinks
and
almost
dies
away
into
a
deathly
stillness
we
say
to
ourselves
rest
awhile
poor
troubled
spirit
all
living
creatures
bear
so
great
a
burden
that
we
wish
them
an
eternal
rest
night
invites
to
human
beings
were
deprived
of
the
sun
and
resisted
night
by
means
of
moonlight
and
what
a
philosophy
would
cast
its
veil
over
them
we
already
see
only
too
plainly
how
a
shadow
is
thrown
over
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
nature
of
man
by
that
moiety
of
darkness
and
sunlessness
that
envelops
life
origin
of
the
doctrine
of
free
sways
one
man
in
the
shape
of
his
passions
another
as
a
habit
of
hearing
and
obeying
a
third
as
a
logical
conscience
a
fourth
as
a
caprice
and
a
mischievous
delight
in
evasions
these
four
however
seek
the
freedom
of
their
will
at
the
very
point
where
they
are
most
securely
fettered
it
is
as
if
the
silkworm
sought
freedom
of
will
in
spinning
what
is
the
reason
clearly
this
that
every
one
thinks
himself
most
free
where
his
vitality
is
strongest
hence
as
i
have
said
now
in
passion
now
in
duty
now
in
knowledge
now
in
caprice
a
man
unconsciously
imagines
that
where
he
is
strong
where
he
feels
most
thoroughly
alive
the
element
of
his
freedom
must
lie
he
thinks
of
dependence
and
apathy
independence
and
vivacity
as
forming
inevitable
an
experience
that
a
man
has
undergone
in
the
social
and
political
sphere
is
wrongly
transferred
to
the
ultimate
metaphysical
sphere
there
the
strong
man
is
also
the
free
man
there
the
vivid
feeling
of
joy
and
sorrow
the
high
hopes
the
keen
desires
the
powerful
hates
are
the
attributes
of
the
ruling
independent
natures
while
the
thrall
and
the
slave
live
in
a
state
of
dazed
doctrine
of
free
will
is
an
invention
of
the
ruling
classes
absence
of
feeling
of
new
long
as
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
in
some
way
dependent
we
consider
ourselves
false
conclusion
that
shows
how
proud
man
is
how
eager
for
dominion
for
he
hereby
assumes
that
he
would
always
be
sure
to
observe
and
recognise
dependence
so
soon
as
he
suffered
it
the
preliminary
hypothesis
being
that
he
generally
lives
in
independence
and
that
should
he
lose
that
independence
for
once
in
a
way
he
would
immediately
detect
a
contrary
however
the
reverse
to
be
he
is
always
living
in
a
complex
state
of
dependence
but
thinks
himself
free
where
through
long
habit
he
no
longer
feels
the
weight
of
the
chain
he
only
suffers
from
new
chains
and
free
will
really
means
nothing
more
than
an
absence
of
feeling
of
new
chains
freedom
of
the
will
and
the
isolation
of
ordinary
inaccurate
observation
takes
a
group
of
phenomena
as
one
and
calls
them
a
fact
between
this
fact
and
another
we
imagine
a
vacuum
we
isolate
each
fact
in
reality
however
the
sum
of
our
actions
and
cognitions
is
no
series
of
facts
and
intervening
vacua
but
a
continuous
stream
now
the
belief
in
free
will
is
incompatible
with
the
idea
of
a
continuous
uniform
undivided
indivisible
flow
this
belief
presupposes
that
every
single
action
is
isolated
and
indivisible
it
is
an
atomic
theory
as
regards
volition
and
misunderstand
facts
as
we
misunderstand
characters
speaking
of
similar
characters
and
similar
facts
whereas
both
are
further
we
bestow
praise
and
blame
only
on
this
false
hypothesis
that
there
are
similar
facts
that
a
graduated
order
of
species
of
facts
exists
corresponding
to
a
graduated
order
of
values
thus
we
isolate
not
only
the
single
fact
but
the
groups
of
apparently
equal
facts
good
evil
compassionate
envious
actions
and
so
forth
in
both
cases
we
are
word
and
the
concept
are
the
most
obvious
reason
for
our
belief
in
this
isolation
of
groups
of
actions
we
do
not
merely
thereby
designate
the
things
the
thought
at
the
back
of
our
minds
is
that
by
the
word
and
the
concept
we
can
grasp
the
essence
of
the
actions
we
are
still
constantly
led
astray
by
words
and
actions
and
are
induced
to
think
of
things
as
simpler
than
they
are
as
separate
indivisible
existing
in
the
absolute
language
contains
a
hidden
philosophical
mythology
which
however
careful
we
may
be
breaks
out
afresh
at
every
moment
the
belief
in
free
is
to
say
in
similar
facts
and
isolated
in
language
its
continual
apostle
and
advocate
the
fundamental
man
can
not
feel
any
psychical
pleasure
or
pain
unless
he
is
swayed
by
one
of
two
illusions
either
he
believes
in
the
identity
of
certain
facts
certain
sensations
and
in
that
case
finds
spiritual
pleasure
and
pain
in
comparing
present
with
past
conditions
and
in
noting
their
similarity
or
difference
as
is
invariably
the
case
with
recollection
or
he
believes
in
the
freedom
of
the
will
perhaps
when
he
reflects
i
ought
not
to
have
done
this
this
might
have
turned
out
differently
and
from
these
reflections
likewise
he
derives
pleasure
and
pain
without
the
errors
that
are
rife
in
every
psychical
pain
and
pleasure
humanity
would
never
have
developed
for
the
root
idea
of
humanity

that
man
is
free

again

us
a
trick
in
that
we
men
should
like
in
this
vanity
at

to

marvellous
and
incomparable
our
uniqueness
in

oh
what
an
improbable
thing
it
is
astronomers
who
occasionally
acquire
a
horizon
outside
our
world
give
us
to
understand
that
the
drop
of
life
on
the
earth
is
without
significance
for
the
total
character
of
the
mighty
ocean
of
birth
and
decay
that
countless
stars
present
conditions
for
the
generation
of
life
similar
to
those
of
the
yet
these
are
but
a
handful
in
comparison
with
the
endless
number
that
have
never
known
or
have
long
been
cured
of
the
eruption
of
life
that
life
on
each
of
these
stars
measured
by
the
period
of
its
existence
has
been
but
an
instant
a
flicker
with
long
long
intervals
thus
in
no
way
the
aim
and
final
purpose
of
their
existence
possibly
the
ant
in
the
forest
is
quite
as
firmly
convinced
that
it
is
the
aim
and
purpose
of
the
existence
of
the
forest
as
we
are
convinced
in
our
imaginations
almost
unconsciously
that
the
destruction
of
mankind
involves
the
destruction
of
the
world
it
is
even
modesty
on
our
part
to
go
no
farther
than
this
and
not
to
arrange
a
universal
twilight
of
the
world
and
the
gods
as
the
funeral
ceremony
of
the
last
man
even
to
the
eye
of
the
most
unbiassed
astronomer
a
lifeless
world
can
scarcely
appear
otherwise
than
as
a
shining
and
swinging
star
wherein
man
lies
buried
the
modesty
of
little
pleasure
is
enough
for
the
majority
to
make
them
feel
that
life
is
good
how
modest
is
man
where
indifference
is
would
be
more
perverse
than
to
wait
for
the
truths
that
science
will
finally
establish
concerning
the
first
and
last
things
and
until
then
to
think
and
especially
to
believe
in
the
traditional
way
as
one
is
so
often
advised
to
do
the
impulse
that
bids
us
seek
nothing
but
in
this
domain
is
a
religious
offshoot
nothing
hidden
and
only
apparently
sceptical
variety
of
the
metaphysical
need
the
underlying
idea
being
that
for
a
long
time
no
view
of
these
ultimate
certainties
will
be
obtainable
and
that
until
then
the
believer
has
the
right
not
to
trouble
himself
about
the
whole
subject
we
have
no
need
of
these
certainties
about
the
farthermost
horizons
in
order
to
live
a
full
and
efficient
human
life
any
more
than
the
ant
needs
them
in
order
to
be
a
good
ant
rather
must
we
ascertain
the
origin
of
that
troublesome
significance
that
we
have
attached
to
these
things
for
so
long
for
this
we
require
the
history
of
ethical
and
religious
sentiments
since
it
is
only
under
the
influence
of
such
sentiments
that
these
most
acute
problems
of
knowledge
have
become
so
weighty
and
terrifying
into
the
outermost
regions
to
which
the
mental
eye
can
penetrate
without
ever
penetrating
them
we
have
smuggled
such
concepts
as
guilt
and
punishment
everlasting
punishment
too
the
darker
those
regions
the
more
careless
we
have
been
for
ages
men
have
let
their
imaginations
run
riot
where
they
could
establish
nothing
and
have
induced
posterity
to
accept
these
fantasies
as
something
serious
and
true
with
this
abominable
lie
as
their
final
that
faith
is
worth
more
than
knowledge
what
we
need
now
in
regard
to
these
ultimate
things
is
not
knowledge
as
against
faith
but
indifference
as
against
faith
and
pretended
knowledge
in
these
matters
must
lie
nearer
to
us
than
what
has
hitherto
been
preached
to
us
as
the
most
important
thing
i
mean
the
questions
what
end
does
man
serve
what
is
his
fate
after
death
how
does
he
make
his
peace
with
god
and
all
the
rest
of
that
bag
of
tricks
the
problems
of
the
dogmatic
philosophers
be
they
idealists
materialists
or
realists
concern
us
as
little
as
do
these
religious
questions
they
all
have
the
same
object
in
force
us
to
a
decision
in
matters
where
neither
faith
nor
knowledge
is
needed
it
is
better
even
for
the
most
ardent
lover
of
knowledge
that
the
territory
open
to
investigation
and
to
reason
should
be
encircled
by
a
belt
of
treacherous
marshland
a
strip
of
ever
watery
impenetrable
and
indeterminable
country
it
is
just
by
the
comparison
with
the
realm
of
darkness
on
the
edge
of
the
world
of
knowledge
that
the
bright
accessible
region
of
that
world
rises
in
must
once
more
become
good
friends
of
the
everyday
matters
and
not
as
hitherto
despise
them
and
look
beyond
them
at
clouds
and
monsters
of
the
night
in
forests
and
caverns
in
marshy
tracts
and
under
dull
skies
on
the
lowest
rungs
of
the
ladder
of
culture
man
has
lived
for
æons
and
lived
in
poverty
there
he
has
learnt
to
despise
the
present
his
neighbours
his
life
and
himself
and
we
the
inhabitants
of
the
brighter
fields
of
nature
and
mind
still
inherit
in
our
blood
some
taint
of
this
contempt
for
everyday
matters
profound
who
has
interpreted
a
passage
in
an
author
more
profoundly
than
was
intended
has
not
interpreted
the
author
but
has
obscured
him
our
metaphysicians
are
in
the
same
relation
or
even
in
a
worse
relation
to
the
text
of
nature
for
to
apply
their
profound
interpretations
they
often
alter
the
text
to
suit
their
in
other
words
corrupt
the
text
a
curious
example
of
the
corruption
and
obscuration
of
an
author
s
text
is
furnished
by
the
ideas
of
schopenhauer
on
the
pregnancy
of
women
the
sign
of
a
continuous
will
to
life
in
time
he
says
is
copulation
the
sign
of
the
light
of
knowledge
which
is
associated
anew
with
this
will
and
holds
the
possibility
of
a
deliverance
and
that
too
in
the
highest
degree
of
clearness
is
the
renewed
incarnation
of
the
will
to
life
this
incarnation
is
betokened
by
pregnancy
which
is
therefore
frank
and
open
and
even
proud
whereas
copulation
hides
itself
like
a
he
declares
that
every
woman
if
surprised
in
the
sexual
act
would
be
likely
to
die
of
shame
but
displays
her
pregnancy
without
a
trace
of
shame
nay
even
with
a
sort
of
now
firstly
this
condition
can
not
easily
be
displayed
more
aggressively
than
it
displays
itself
and
when
schopenhauer
gives
prominence
only
to
the
intentional
character
of
the
display
he
is
fashioning
his
text
to
suit
the
interpretation
moreover
his
statement
of
the
universality
of
the
phenomenon
is
not
true
he
speaks
of
every
many
women
especially
the
younger
often
appear
painfully
ashamed
of
their
condition
even
in
the
presence
of
their
nearest
kinsfolk
and
when
women
of
riper
years
especially
in
the
humbler
classes
do
actually
appear
proud
of
their
condition
it
is
because
they
would
give
us
to
understand
that
they
are
still
desirable
to
their
husbands
that
a
neighbour
on
seeing
them
or
a
passing
stranger
should
say
or
think
can
it
be
possible
is
an
alms
always
acceptable
to
the
vanity
of
women
of
low
mental
capacity
in
the
reverse
instance
to
conclude
from
schopenhauer
s
proposition
the
cleverest
and
most
intelligent
women
would
tend
more
than
any
to
exult
openly
in
their
condition
for
they
have
the
best
prospect
of
giving
birth
to
an
intellectual
prodigy
in
whom
the
will
can
once
more
negative
itself
for
the
universal
good
stupid
women
on
the
other
hand
would
have
every
reason
to
hide
their
pregnancy
more
modestly
than
anything
they
can
not
be
said
that
this
view
corresponds
to
reality
granted
however
that
schopenhauer
was
right
on
the
general
principle
that
women
show
more
when
pregnant
than
at
any
other
time
a
better
explanation
than
this
lies
to
hand
one
might
imagine
the
clucking
of
a
hen
even
before
she
lays
an
egg
saying
look
look
i
shall
lay
an
egg
i
shall
lay
an
egg
the
modern
we
look
for
man
we
must
have
found
the
it
have
to
be
the
cynic
s
lantern
must
now
put
up
with
being
rated
as
immoralists
because
they
dissect
morals
he
however
who
would
dissect
must
kill
but
only
in
order
that
we
may
know
more
judge
better
live
better
not
in
order
that
all
the
world
may
dissect
unfortunately
men
still
think
that
every
moralist
in
his
every
action
must
be
a
pattern
for
others
to
imitate
they
confound
him
with
the
preacher
of
morality
the
older
moralists
did
not
dissect
enough
and
preached
too
often
whence
that
confusion
and
the
unpleasant
consequences
for
our
moralists
are
derived
a
caution
against
are
moralists
who
treat
the
strong
noble
attitude
of
such
beings
as
the
heroes
of
plutarch
or
the
pure
enlightened
state
of
soul
peculiar
to
truly
good
men
and
women
as
difficult
scientific
problems
they
investigate
the
origin
of
such
phenomena
indicating
the
complex
element
in
the
apparent
simplicity
and
directing
their
gaze
to
the
tangled
skein
of
motives
the
delicate
web
of
conceptual
illusions
and
the
sentiments
of
individuals
or
of
groups
that
are
a
legacy
of
ancient
days
gradually
increased
such
moralists
are
very
different
from
those
with
whom
they
are
most
commonly
confounded
from
those
petty
minds
that
do
not
believe
at
all
in
these
modes
of
thought
and
states
of
soul
and
imagine
their
own
poverty
to
be
hidden
somewhere
behind
the
glamour
of
greatness
and
purity
the
moralists
say
here
are
problems
and
these
pitiable
creatures
say
here
are
impostors
and
thus
the
latter
deny
the
existence
of
the
very
things
which
the
former
are
at
pains
to
explain
as
the
all
human
morality
had
its
origin
in
the
tremendous
excitement
that
seized
primitive
man
when
he
discovered
measure
and
measuring
scales
and
weighing
for
the
word
man
means
the
measurer
wished
to
himself
after
his
greatest
discovery
with
these
ideas
they
mounted
into
regions
that
are
quite
beyond
all
measuring
and
weighing
but
did
not
appear
to
be
so
in
the
beginning
principle
of
robber
and
the
man
of
power
who
promises
to
protect
a
community
from
robbers
are
perhaps
at
bottom
beings
of
the
same
mould
save
that
the
latter
attains
his
ends
by
other
means
than
the
is
to
say
through
regular
imposts
paid
to
him
by
the
community
and
no
longer
through
forced
contributions
the
same
relation
exists
between
merchant
and
pirate
who
for
a
long
period
are
one
and
the
same
person
where
the
one
function
appears
to
them
inadvisable
they
exercise
the
other
even
mercantile
morality
is
really
nothing
but
a
refinement
on
piratical
in
the
cheapest
market
at
prime
cost
if
possible
and
selling
in
the
dearest
the
essential
point
is
that
the
man
of
power
promises
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
against
the
robber
and
herein
the
weak
find
a
possibility
of
living
for
either
they
must
group
themselves
into
an
equivalent
power
or
they
must
subject
themselves
to
some
one
of
equivalent
power
render
service
in
return
for
his
efforts
the
latter
course
is
generally
preferred
because
it
really
keeps
two
dangerous
beings
in
robber
through
the
man
of
power
and
the
man
of
power
through
the
standpoint
of
advantage
for
the
latter
profits
by
treating
his
subjects
with
graciousness
and
tolerance
in
order
that
they
may
support
not
only
themselves
but
their
ruler
as
a
matter
of
fact
conditions
may
still
be
hard
and
cruel
enough
yet
in
comparison
with
the
complete
annihilation
that
was
formerly
always
a
possibility
men
breathe
community
is
at
first
the
organisation
of
the
weak
to
counterbalance
menacing
forces
an
organisation
to
outweigh
those
forces
would
be
more
advisable
if
its
members
grew
strong
enough
to
destroy
the
adverse
power
and
when
it
is
a
question
of
one
mighty
oppressor
the
certainly
be
made
but
if
the
one
man
is
the
head
of
a
clan
or
if
he
has
a
large
following
a
rapid
and
decisive
annihilation
is
improbable
and
a
long
or
permanent
feud
is
only
to
be
expected
this
feud
however
involves
the
least
desirable
condition
for
the
community
for
it
thereby
loses
the
time
to
provide
for
its
means
of
subsistence
with
the
necessary
regularity
and
sees
the
product
of
all
work
hourly
threatened
hence
the
community
prefers
to
raise
its
power
of
attack
and
defence
to
the
exact
plane
on
which
the
power
of
its
dangerous
neighbour
stands
and
to
give
him
to
understand
that
an
equal
weight
now
lies
in
its
own
side
of
the
why
not
be
good
friends
equilibrium
is
a
most
important
conception
for
the
understanding
of
the
ancient
doctrines
of
law
and
morals
equilibrium
is
in
fact
the
basis
of
justice
when
justice
in
ruder
ages
says
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
it
presupposes
the
attainment
of
this
equilibrium
and
tries
to
maintain
it
by
means
of
this
compensation
so
that
when
crime
is
committed
the
injured
party
will
not
take
the
revenge
of
blind
anger
by
means
of
the
the
equilibrium
of
the
disturbed
relations
of
power
is
restored
for
in
such
primitive
times
an
eye
or
an
arm
more
means
a
bit
more
power
more
a
community
where
all
consider
themselves
equal
disgrace
and
punishment
await
is
violations
of
the
principle
of
equilibrium
disgrace
is
thrown
into
the
scale
as
a
against
the
encroaching
individual
who
has
gained
profit
by
his
encroachment
and
now
suffers
losses
through
disgrace
which
annul
and
outweigh
the
previous
profits
punishment
in
the
same
way
sets
up
a
far
greater
against
the
preponderance
which
every
criminal
hopes
to
as
against
a
deed
of
violence
restitution
and
fines
as
against
theft
thus
the
sinner
is
reminded
that
his
action
has
excluded
him
from
the
community
and
from
its
moral
advantages
since
the
community
treats
him
as
an
inferior
a
weaker
brother
an
outsider
for
this
reason
punishment
is
not
merely
retaliation
but
has
something
more
something
of
the
cruelty
of
the
state
of
nature
and
of
this
it
would
serve
as
a
reminder
whether
the
adherents
of
the
doctrine
of
free
will
have
a
right
to
punish
whose
vocation
it
is
to
judge
and
punish
try
to
establish
in
every
case
whether
an
is
really
responsible
for
his
act
whether
he
was
able
to
apply
his
reasoning
powers
whether
he
acted
with
motives
and
not
unconsciously
or
under
constraint
if
he
is
punished
it
is
because
he
preferred
the
worse
to
the
better
motives
which
he
must
consequently
have
known
where
this
knowledge
is
wanting
man
is
according
to
the
prevailing
view
not
his
ignorance
his
be
the
consequence
of
an
intentional
neglect
to
learn
what
he
ought
in
that
case
he
already
preferred
the
worse
to
the
better
motives
at
the
time
when
he
refused
to
learn
and
must
now
pay
the
penalty
of
his
unwise
choice
if
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
through
stupidity
or
shortsightedness
he
has
never
seen
the
better
motives
he
is
generally
not
punished
for
people
say
that
he
made
a
wrong
choice
he
acted
like
a
brute
beast
the
intentional
rejection
of
the
better
reason
is
now
needed
before
we
treat
the
offender
as
fit
to
be
punished
but
how
can
any
one
be
intentionally
more
unreasonable
than
he
ought
to
be
whence
comes
the
decision
if
the
scales
are
loaded
with
good
and
bad
motives
so
the
origin
is
not
error
or
blindness
not
an
internal
or
external
constraint
it
should
furthermore
be
remembered
that
every
external
constraint
is
nothing
more
than
the
internal
constraint
of
fear
and
pain
whence
is
the
repeated
question
so
reason
is
not
to
be
the
cause
of
action
because
reason
can
not
decide
against
the
better
motives
thus
we
call
free
will
to
our
aid
absolute
discretion
is
to
decide
and
a
moment
is
to
intervene
when
no
motive
exercises
an
influence
when
the
deed
is
done
as
a
miracle
resulting
from
nothing
this
assumed
discretion
is
punished
in
a
case
where
no
discretion
should
rule
reason
which
knows
law
prohibition
and
command
should
have
left
no
choice
they
say
and
should
have
acted
as
a
constraint
and
a
higher
power
hence
the
offender
is
punished
because
he
makes
use
of
free
will
other
words
has
acted
without
motive
where
he
should
have
been
guided
by
motives
but
why
did
he
do
it
this
question
must
not
even
be
asked
the
deed
was
done
without
a
why
without
motive
without
origin
being
a
thing
purposeless
according
to
the
preliminary
condition
of
punishability
such
a
deed
should
not
be
punished
at
all
moreover
even
this
reason
for
punishing
should
not
hold
good
that
in
this
case
something
had
been
done
had
been
omitted
that
reason
had
not
been
used
at
all
for
at
any
rate
the
omission
was
unintentional
and
only
intentional
omission
is
considered
punishable
the
offender
has
indeed
preferred
the
worse
to
the
better
motives
but
without
motive
and
purpose
he
has
indeed
failed
to
apply
his
reason
but
not
exactly
with
the
object
of
not
applying
it
the
very
assumption
made
in
the
case
of
punishable
crime
that
the
criminal
intentionally
renounced
his
reason
is
removed
by
the
hypothesis
of
free
according
to
your
own
principles
you
must
not
punish
you
adherents
of
the
doctrine
of
free
will
principles
are
however
nothing
but
a
very
marvellous
conceptual
mythology
and
the
hen
that
hatched
them
has
brooded
on
her
eggs
far
away
from
all
reality
judging
the
criminal
and
his
criminal
who
knows
the
whole
concatenation
of
circumstances
does
not
consider
his
act
so
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
order
and
comprehension
as
does
his
judge
his
punishment
however
is
measured
by
the
degree
of
astonishment
that
seizes
the
judge
when
he
finds
the
crime
the
defending
counsel
s
knowledge
of
the
case
and
its
previous
history
extends
far
enough
the
extenuating
circumstances
which
he
duly
pleads
must
end
by
absolving
his
client
from
all
guilt
or
to
put
it
more
plainly
the
advocate
will
step
by
step
tone
down
and
finally
remove
the
astonishment
of
the
judge
by
forcing
every
honest
listener
to
the
tacit
avowal
he
was
bound
to
act
as
he
did
and
if
we
punished
we
should
be
punishing
eternal
the
punishment
by
the
degree
of
knowledge
we
possess
or
can
obtain
of
the
previous
history
of
the
that
not
in
conflict
with
all
equity
exchange
and
an
exchange
the
only
just
and
honest
course
would
be
for
either
party
to
demand
only
so
much
as
he
considers
his
commodity
to
be
worth
allowance
being
made
for
trouble
in
acquisition
scarcity
time
spent
and
so
forth
besides
the
subjective
value
as
soon
as
you
make
your
price
bear
a
relation
to
the
other
s
need
you
become
a
refined
sort
of
robber
and
money
is
the
sole
medium
of
exchange
we
must
remember
that
a
shilling
is
by
no
means
the
same
thing
in
the
hands
of
a
rich
heir
a
farm
labourer
a
merchant
and
a
university
student
it
would
be
equitable
for
every
one
to
receive
much
or
little
for
his
money
according
as
he
has
done
much
or
little
to
earn
it
in
practice
as
we
all
know
the
reverse
is
the
case
in
the
world
of
high
finance
the
shilling
of
the
idle
rich
man
can
buy
more
than
that
of
the
poor
industrious
man
legal
conditions
as
where
it
rests
upon
contracts
between
equals
holds
good
so
long
as
the
power
of
the
parties
to
the
contract
remains
equal
or
similar
wisdom
created
law
to
end
all
feuds
and
useless
expenditure
among
men
on
an
equal
footing
quite
as
definite
an
end
is
put
to
this
waste
however
when
one
party
has
become
decidedly
weaker
than
the
other
subjection
enters
and
law
ceases
but
the
result
is
the
same
as
that
attained
by
law
for
now
it
is
the
wisdom
of
the
superior
which
advises
to
spare
the
inferior
and
not
uselessly
to
squander
his
strength
thus
the
position
of
the
inferior
is
often
more
favourable
than
that
of
the
legal
conditions
are
temporary
counselled
by
wisdom
and
not

explanation
of
malicious
joy
arises
when
a
man
consciously
finds
himself
in
evil
plight
and
feels
anxiety
or
remorse
or
pain
the
misfortune
that
overtakes
makes
him
equal
to
and
is
reconciled
and
no
longer
is
prosperous
he
still
hoards
up
in
his
memory
s
misfortune
as
a
capital
so
as
to
throw
it
in
the
scale
as
a
when
he
himself
suffers
adversity
in
this
case
too
he
feels
malicious
joy
the
sentiment
of
equality
thus
applies
its
standard
to
the
domain
of
luck
and
chance
malicious
joy
is
the
commonest
expression
of
victory
and
restoration
of
equality
even
in
a
higher
state
of
civilisation
this
emotion
has
only
been
in
existence
since
the
time
when
man
learnt
to
look
upon
another
as
his
other
words
since
the
foundation
of
society
the
arbitrary
element
in
the
award
of
most
criminals
punishment
comes
just
as
illegitimate
children
come
to
women
they
have
done
the
same
thing
a
hundred
times
without
any
bad
consequences
suddenly
comes
discovery
and
with
discovery
punishment
yet
habit
should
make
the
deed
for
which
the
criminal
is
punished
appear
more
excusable
for
he
has
developed
a
propensity
that
is
hard
to
resist
instead
of
this
the
criminal
is
punished
more
severely
if
the
suspicion
of
habitual
crime
rests
on
him
and
habit
is
made
a
valid
reason
against
all
extenuation
on
the
other
hand
a
model
life
wherein
crime
shows
up
in
more
terrible
contrast
should
make
the
guilt
appear
more
heavy
but
here
the
custom
is
to
soften
the
punishment
everything
is
measured
not
from
the
standpoint
of
the
criminal
but
from
that
of
society
and
its
losses
and
dangers
the
previous
utility
of
an
individual
is
weighed
against
his
one
nefarious
action
his
previous
criminality
is
added
to
that
recently
discovered
and
punishment
is
thus
meted
out
as
highly
as
possible
but
if
we
thus
punish
or
reward
a
man
s
past
for
in
the
former
case
the
diminution
of
punishment
is
a
reward
we
ought
to
go
farther
back
and
punish
and
reward
the
cause
of
his
mean
parents
teachers
society
in
many
instances
we
shall
then
find
the
somehow
or
other
sharing
in
the
guilt
it
is
arbitrary
to
stop
at
the
criminal
himself
when
we
punish
his
past
if
we
will
not
grant
the
absolute
excusability
of
every
crime
we
should
stop
at
each
individual
case
and
probe
no
farther
into
the
other
words
isolate
guilt
and
not
connect
it
with
previous
actions
otherwise
we
sin
against
logic
the
teachers
of
free
will
should
draw
the
inevitable
conclusion
from
their
doctrine
of
free
will
and
boldly
decree
no
action
has
a
envy
and
her
nobler
equality
is
really
recognised
and
permanently
established
we
see
the
rise
of
that
propensity
that
is
generally
considered
immoral
and
would
scarcely
be
conceivable
in
a
state
of
the
envious
man
is
susceptible
to
every
sign
of
individual
superiority
to
the
common
herd
and
wishes
to
depress
every
one
once
more
to
the
raise
himself
to
the
superior
plane
hence
arise
two
different
modes
of
action
which
hesiod
designated
good
and
bad
eris
in
the
same
way
in
a
condition
of
equality
there
arises
indignation
if
is
prosperous
above
and
unfortunate
beneath
their
deserts
and
equality
these
latter
however
are
emotions
of
nobler
natures
they
feel
the
want
of
justice
and
equity
in
things
that
are
independent
of
the
arbitrary
choice
of
in
other
words
they
desire
the
equality
recognised
by
man
to
be
recognised
as
well
by
nature
and
chance
they
are
angry
that
men
of
equal
merits
should
not
have
equal
fortune
the
envy
of
the
the
envy
of
the
gods
arises
when
a
despised
person
sets
himself
on
an
equality
with
his
superior
like
ajax
or
is
made
equal
with
him
by
the
favour
of
fortune
like
niobe
the
too
favoured
mother
in
the
social
class
system
this
envy
demands
that
no
one
shall
have
merits
above
his
station
that
his
prosperity
shall
be
on
a
level
with
his
position
and
especially
that
his
shall
not
outgrow
the
limits
of
his
rank
often
the
victorious
general
or
the
pupil
who
achieves
a
masterpiece
has
experienced
the
envy
of
the
vanity
as
an
men
for
the
sake
of
security
have
made
themselves
equal
in
order
to
found
communities
but
as
also
this
conception
is
imposed
by
a
sort
of
constraint
and
is
entirely
opposed
to
the
instincts
of
the
individual
so
the
more
universal
security
is
guaranteed
the
more
do
new
offshoots
of
the
old
instinct
for
predominance
appear
such
offshoots
appear
in
the
of
class
distinctions
in
the
demand
for
professional
dignities
and
privileges
and
generally
speaking
in
vanity
manners
dress
speech
and
so
forth
so
soon
as
danger
to
the
community
is
apparent
the
majority
who
were
unable
to
assert
their
preponderance
in
a
time
of
universal
peace
once
more
bring
about
the
condition
of
equality
and
for
the
time
being
the
absurd
privileges
and
vanities
disappear
if
the
community
however
collapses
utterly
and
anarchy
reigns
supreme
there
arises
the
state
of
nature
an
absolutely
ruthless
inequality
as
recounted
by
thucydides
in
the
case
of
corcyra
neither
a
natural
justice
nor
a
natural
injustice
exists
is
a
development
of
justice
and
arises
among
such
as
do
not
come
into
conflict
with
the
communal
equality
this
more
subtle
recognition
of
the
principle
of
equilibrium
is
applied
to
cases
where
nothing
is
prescribed
by
law
equity
looks
forwards
and
backwards
its
maxim
being
do
unto
others
as
you
would
that
they
should
do
unto
means
this
principle
is
conformable
to
our
equality
it
tones
down
even
our
small
differences
to
an
appearance
of
equality
and
expects
us
to
be
indulgent
in
cases
where
we
are
not
compelled
to
elements
of
word
revenge
is
spoken
so
quickly
that
it
almost
seems
as
if
it
could
not
contain
more
than
one
conceptual
and
emotional
root
hence
we
are
still
at
pains
to
find
this
root
our
economists
in
the
same
way
have
never
wearied
of
scenting
a
similar
unity
in
the
word
value
and
of
hunting
after
the
primitive
root
idea
of
value
as
if
all
words
were
not
pockets
into
which
this
or
that
or
several
things
have
been
stuffed
at
once
so
revenge
is
now
one
thing
now
another
and
sometimes
more
composite
let
us
first
distinguish
that
defensive
which
we
strike
almost
unconsciously
even
at
inanimate
objects
such
as
machinery
in
motion
that
have
hurt
us
the
notion
is
to
set
a
check
to
the
object
that
has
hurt
us
by
bringing
the
machine
to
a
stop
sometimes
the
force
of
this
in
order
to
attain
its
object
will
have
to
be
strong
enough
to
shatter
the
machine
if
the
machine
be
too
strong
to
be
disorganised
by
one
man
the
latter
will
all
the
same
strike
the
most
violent
blow
he
a
sort
of
last
attempt
we
behave
similarly
towards
persons
who
hurt
us
at
the
immediate
sensation
of
the
hurt
if
we
like
to
call
this
an
act
of
revenge
well
and
good
but
we
must
remember
that
here
alone
has
set
its
of
reason
in
motion
and
that
after
all
we
do
not
think
of
the
doer
of
the
injury
but
only
of
ourselves
we
act
without
any
idea
of
doing
injury
in
return
only
with
a
view
to
getting
away
safe
and
needs
time
to
pass
in
thought
from
oneself
to
one
s
adversary
and
ask
oneself
at
what
point
he
is
most
vulnerable
this
is
done
in
the
second
variety
of
revenge
the
preliminary
idea
of
which
is
to
consider
the
vulnerability
and
susceptibility
of
the
other
the
intention
then
is
to
give
pain
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
of
securing
himself
against
further
injury
is
in
this
case
so
entirely
outside
the
avenger
s
horizon
that
he
almost
regularly
brings
about
his
own
further
injury
and
often
foresees
it
in
cold
blood
if
in
the
first
sort
of
revenge
it
was
the
fear
of
a
second
blow
that
made
the
as
strong
as
possible
in
this
case
there
is
an
almost
complete
indifference
to
what
one
s
adversary
will
do
the
strength
of
the
is
only
determined
by
what
he
has
done
to
us
then
what
has
he
done
what
profit
is
it
to
us
if
he
is
now
suffering
after
we
have
suffered
through
him
this
is
a
case
of
readjustment
whereas
the
first
act
of
revenge
only
serves
the
purpose
of
it
may
be
that
through
our
adversary
we
have
lost
property
rank
friends
losses
are
not
recovered
by
revenge
the
readjustment
only
concerns
a
subsidiary
loss
which
is
added
to
all
the
other
losses
the
revenge
of
readjustment
does
not
preserve
one
from
further
injury
it
does
not
make
good
the
injury
already
in
one
case
if
our
honour
has
suffered
through
our
adversary
revenge
can
restore
it
but
in
any
case
honour
suffered
an
injury
if
intentional
harm
has
been
done
us
because
our
adversary
proved
thereby
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
us
by
revenge
we
prove
that
we
are
not
afraid
of
him
either
and
herein
lies
the
settlement
the
readjustment
the
intention
of
showing
their
complete
lack
of
fear
goes
so
far
in
some
people
that
the
dangers
of
of
health
or
life
or
other
in
their
eyes
an
indispensable
condition
of
every
vengeful
act
hence
they
practise
the
duel
although
the
law
also
offers
them
aid
in
obtaining
satisfaction
for
what
they
have
suffered
they
are
not
satisfied
with
a
safe
means
of
recovering
their
honour
because
this
would
not
prove
their
fearlessness
the
variety
of
revenge
it
is
just
fear
that
strikes
the
in
the
second
case
it
is
the
absence
of
fear
which
as
has
been
said
wishes
to
manifest
itself
in
the
nothing
appears
more
different
than
the
motives
of
the
two
courses
of
action
which
are
designated
by
the
one
word
yet
it
often
happens
that
the
avenger
is
not
precisely
certain
as
to
what
really
prompted
his
deed
perhaps
he
struck
the
counterblow
from
fear
and
the
instinct
of
but
in
the
background
when
he
has
time
to
reflect
upon
the
standpoint
of
wounded
honour
he
imagines
that
he
has
avenged
himself
for
the
sake
of
his
motive
is
in
any
case
more
than
the
other
an
essential
point
is
whether
he
sees
his
honour
injured
in
the
eyes
of
others
the
world
or
only
in
the
eyes
of
his
offenders
in
the
latter
case
he
will
prefer
secret
in
the
former
open
revenge
accordingly
as
he
enters
strongly
or
feebly
into
the
soul
of
the
doer
and
the
spectator
his
revenge
will
be
more
bitter
or
more
tame
if
he
is
entirely
lacking
in
this
sort
of
imagination
he
will
not
think
at
all
of
revenge
as
the
feeling
of
honour
is
not
present
in
him
and
accordingly
can
not
be
wounded
in
the
same
way
he
will
not
think
of
revenge
if
he
despises
the
offender
and
the
spectator
because
as
objects
of
his
contempt
they
can
not
give
him
honour
and
accordingly
can
not
rob
him
of
honour
finally
he
will
forego
revenge
in
the
not
uncommon
case
of
his
loving
the
offender
it
is
true
that
he
then
suffers
loss
of
honour
in
the
other
s
eyes
and
will
perhaps
become
less
worthy
of
having
his
love
returned
but
even
to
renounce
all
requital
of
love
is
a
sacrifice
that
love
is
ready
to
make
when
its
only
object
is
to
avoid
hurting
the
beloved
object
this
would
mean
hurting
oneself
more
than
one
is
hurt
by
the
every
one
will
avenge
himself
unless
he
be
bereft
of
honour
or
inspired
by
contempt
or
by
love
for
the
offender
even
if
he
turns
to
the
he
desires
revenge
as
a
private
individual
but
also
as
a
thoughtful
prudent
man
of
society
he
desires
the
revenge
of
society
upon
one
who
does
not
respect
it
thus
by
legal
punishment
private
honour
as
well
as
that
of
society
is
is
to
say
punishment
is
revenge
punishment
undoubtedly
contains
the
element
of
revenge
in
as
far
as
by
its
means
society
helps
to
preserve
itself
and
strikes
a
in
punishment
desires
to
prevent
further
injury
to
scare
other
offenders
in
this
way
the
two
elements
of
revenge
different
as
they
are
are
united
in
punishment
and
this
may
perhaps
tend
most
of
all
to
maintain
the
confusion
of
ideas
thanks
to
which
the
individual
avenger
generally
does
not
know
what
he
really
wants
the
virtues
that
damage
members
of
communities
we
think
we
have
no
right
to
exercise
certain
virtues
which
afford
us
great
honour
and
some
pleasure
as
private
individuals
for
example
indulgence
and
favour
towards
miscreants
of
all
kinds
short
every
mode
of
action
whereby
the
advantage
of
society
would
suffer
through
our
virtue
no
bench
of
judges
face
to
face
with
its
conscience
may
permit
itself
to
be
gracious
this
privilege
is
reserved
for
the
king
as
an
individual
and
we
are
glad
when
he
makes
use
of
it
proving
that
we
should
like
to
be
gracious
individually
but
not
collectively
society
recognises
only
the
virtues
profitable
to
her
or
at
least
not
injurious
to
like
justice
which
are
exercised
without
loss
or
in
fact
at
compound
interest
the
virtues
that
damage
us
can
not
have
originated
in
society
because
even
now
opposition
to
them
arises
in
every
small
society
that
is
in
the
making
such
virtues
are
therefore
those
of
men
of
unequal
standing
invented
by
the
superior
individuals
they
are
the
virtues
of
rulers
and
the
idea
underlying
them
is
i
am
mighty
enough
to
put
up
with
an
obvious
loss
that
is
a
proof
of
my
thus
they
are
virtues
closely
akin
to
pride
the
casuistry
of
would
be
no
moral
casuistry
if
there
were
no
casuistry
of
advantage
the
most
free
and
refined
intelligence
is
often
incapable
of
choosing
between
two
alternatives
in
such
a
way
that
his
choice
necessarily
involves
the
greater
advantage
in
such
cases
we
choose
because
we
must
and
afterwards
often
feel
a
kind
of
emotional
turning
beggar
turns
hypocrite
like
every
one
who
makes
his
living
out
of
indigence
be
it
personal
or
beggar
does
not
feel
want
nearly
so
keenly
as
he
must
make
others
feel
it
if
he
wishes
to
make
a
living
by
mendicancy
a
sort
of
cult
of
the
hypochondriacs
you
philosophic
talk
of
the
formidable
nature
of
human
passions
in
order
to
inveigh
against
the
dreadsomeness
of
the
whole
as
if
the
passions
were
always
and
everywhere
formidable
as
if
this
sort
of
terror
must
always
exist
in
the
world
a
carelessness
in
small
matters
through
a
deficiency
in
observation
of
self
and
of
the
rising
generation
you
have
yourselves
allowed
your
passions
to
develop
into
such
unruly
monsters
that
you
are
frightened
now
at
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
passion
it
rests
with
you
and
it
rests
with
us
to
divest
the
passions
of
their
formidable
features
and
so
to
dam
them
that
they
do
not
become
devastating
must
not
exalt
our
errors
into
eternal
fatalities
rather
shall
we
honestly
endeavour
to
convert
all
the
passions
of
humanity
into
sources
of
joy
the
sting
of
sting
of
conscience
like
the
gnawing
of
a
dog
at
a
stone
is
mere
foolishness
origin
of
may
be
traced
to
traditions
traditions
to
momentary
agreements
at
some
time
or
other
men
were
mutually
content
with
the
consequences
of
making
an
agreement
and
again
too
indolent
formally
to
renew
it
thus
they
went
on
living
as
if
it
had
constantly
been
renewed
and
gradually
when
oblivion
cast
its
veil
over
the
origin
they
thought
they
possessed
a
sacred
unalterable
foundation
on
which
every
generation
would
be
compelled
to
build
tradition
was
now
a
constraint
even
if
it
no
more
involved
the
profit
originally
derived
from
making
the
the
weak
have
always
found
their
strong
fortress
they
are
inclined
to
immortalise
the
momentary
agreement
the
single
act
of
favour
shown
towards
them
the
significance
of
oblivion
in
moral
same
actions
that
in
primitive
society
first
aimed
at
the
common
advantage
were
later
on
performed
from
other
motives
from
fear
or
reverence
of
those
who
demanded
and
recommended
them
or
from
habit
because
men
had
seen
them
done
about
them
from
childhood
upwards
or
from
kindness
because
the
practising
of
them
caused
delight
and
approving
looks
on
all
sides
or
from
vanity
because
they
were
praised
such
actions
in
which
the
fundamental
motive
that
of
utility
has
been
are
then
called
moral
not
indeed
because
they
are
done
from
those
other
motives
but
because
they
are
not
done
with
a
conscious
purpose
of
the
hatred
of
utility
that
suddenly
manifests
itself
here
and
by
which
all
praiseworthy
actions
formally
exclude
all
actions
for
the
sake
of
utility
society
the
of
all
morality
and
of
all
maxims
in
praise
of
moral
action
has
had
to
battle
too
long
and
too
fiercely
with
the
selfishness
and
obstinacy
of
the
individual
not
to
rate
every
motive
morally
higher
than
utility
hence
it
looks
as
if
morals
had
not
sprung
from
utility
whereas
in
fact
morals
are
originally
the
public
utility
which
had
great
difficulty
in
prevailing
over
the
interests
of
the
unit
and
securing
a
loftier
reputation
the
heirs
to
the
wealth
of
in
the
domain
of
morals
there
is
an
inherited
wealth
which
is
owned
by
the
gentle
the
the
compassionate
the
indulgent
they
have
inherited
from
their
forefathers
their
gentle
mode
of
action
but
not
common
sense
the
source
of
that
mode
of
action
the
pleasant
thing
about
this
wealth
is
that
one
must
always
bestow
and
communicate
a
portion
of
it
if
its
presence
is
to
be
felt
at
all
thus
this
wealth
unconsciously
aims
at
bridging
the
gulf
between
the
morally
rich
and
the
morally
poor
and
what
is
its
best
and
most
remarkable
feature
not
for
the
sake
of
a
future
mean
between
rich
and
poor
but
for
the
sake
of
a
universal
prosperity
and
may
be
the
prevailing
view
of
inherited
moral
wealth
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
view
is
maintained
more
majorem
of
morality
than
in
honour
of
truth
experience
at
least
establishes
a
maxim
which
must
serve
if
not
as
a
refutation
at
any
rate
as
an
important
check
upon
that
generalisation
without
the
most
exquisite
intelligence
says
experience
without
the
most
refined
capacity
for
choice
and
a
strong
propensity
to
observe
the
mean
the
morally
rich
will
become
spendthrifts
of
morality
for
by
abandoning
themselves
without
restraint
to
their
compassionate
gentle
conciliatory
harmonising
instincts
they
make
all
about
them
more
careless
more
covetous
and
more
sentimental
the
children
of
these
highly
moral
spendthrifts
easily
and
sad
to
relate
at
best
become
pleasant
but
futile
wasters
the
judge
and
extenuating
one
should
behave
as
a
man
of
honour
even
towards
the
devil
and
pay
his
debts
said
an
old
soldier
when
the
story
of
faust
had
been
related
to
him
in
rather
fuller
detail
hell
is
the
right
place
for
faust
you
are
terrible
you
men
cried
his
wife
how
can
that
be
after
all
his
only
fault
was
having
no
ink
in
his
it
is
indeed
a
sin
to
write
with
blood
but
surely
for
that
such
a
handsome
man
ought
not
to
burn
in
problem
of
the
duty
of
is
an
imperious
sentiment
that
forces
us
to
action
we
call
it
good
and
consider
it
outside
the
pale
of
discussion
the
origin
limits
and
justification
of
duty
we
will
not
debate
or
allow
to
be
debated
but
the
thinker
considers
everything
an
evolution
and
every
evolution
a
subject
for
discussion
and
is
accordingly
without
duty
so
long
as
he
is
merely
a
thinker
as
such
he
would
not
recognise
the
duty
of
seeing
and
speaking
the
truth
he
would
not
the
sentiment
at
all
he
asks
whence
comes
it
and
whither
will
it
go
but
even
this
questioning
appears
to
him
questionable
surely
however
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
thinker
s
machinery
would
no
longer
work
properly
if
he
could
really
feel
himself
unencumbered
by
duty
in
the
search
for
knowledge
it
would
appear
then
that
for
fuel
the
same
element
is
necessary
as
must
be
investigated
by
means
of
the
the
formula
will
be
granted
there
were
a
duty
of
recognising
truth
what
is
then
the
truth
in
regard
to
every
other
kind
of
duty
is
not
a
hypothetical
sense
of
duty
a
contradiction
in
terms
grades
of

primarily
a
means
of
preserving
the
community
and
saving
it
from
destruction
next
it
is
a
means
of
maintaining
the
community
on
a
certain
plane
and
in
a
certain
degree
of
benevolence
its
motives
are
fear
and
hope
and
these
in
a
more
coarse
rough
and
powerful
form
the
more
the
propensity
towards
the
perverse
and
personal
still
persists
the
most
terrible
means
of
intimidation
must
be
brought
into
play
so
long
as
milder
forms
have
no
effect
and
that
twofold
species
of
preservation
can
not
be
attained
the
strongest
intimidation
by
the
way
is
the
invention
of
a
hereafter
with
a
hell
everlasting
for
this
purpose
we
must
have
racks
and
torturers
of
the
soul
further
grades
of
morality
and
accordingly
means
to
the
end
referred
to
are
the
commandments
of
a
god
as
in
the
mosaic
law
still
further
and
higher
are
the
commandments
of
an
absolute
sense
of
duty
with
a
thou
shalt

roughly
hewn
yet

because
on
the
finer
narrower
steps
men
can
not
yet
set
their
feet
then
comes
a
morality
of
inclination
of
taste
finally
of

beyond
all
the
illusory
motives
of
morality

has
convinced
itself
that

impulses
of

instinctive
morality

has
no
head

seems
merely
to
consist
of
a
heart
and

hands
it
is
to
their

to
cast
suspicion
upon

lies
vanquished
nowadays
a
prohibition
like
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
laid
down
without
reasons
would
have
an
injurious
rather
than
a
beneficial
effect
character
sort
of
a
man
is
it
that
can
say
of
himself
i
despise
very
easily
but
never
hate
i
at
once
find
out
in
every
man
something
which
can
be
honoured
and
for
which
i
honour
him
the
amiable
qualities
attract
me
but
little
pity
and
expression
of
pity
is
regarded
as
a
sign
of
contempt
because
one
has
clearly
ceased
to
be
an
object
of
as
soon
as
one
becomes
an
object
of
pity
one
has
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
equilibrium
for
this
equilibrium
does
not
satisfy
human
vanity
which
is
only
satisfied
by
the
feeling
that
one
is
imposing
respect
and
awe
hence
it
is
difficult
to
explain
why
pity
is
so
highly
prized
just
as
we
need
to
explain
why
the
unselfish
man
who
is
originally
despised
or
feared
as
being
artful
is
praised
the
capacity
of
being
must
be
as
near
to
flowers
grasses
and
butterflies
as
a
child
that
is
not
much
bigger
than
they
we
adults
have
grown
up
beyond
them
and
have
to
stoop
to
them
i
think
the
grasses
hate
us
when
we
confess
our
love
for
who
would
have
a
share
in
all
good
things
must
understand
at
times
how
to
be
small
the
of
of
our
conscience
is
all
that
has
regularly
been
demanded
of
us
without
reason
in
the
days
of
our
childhood
by
people
whom
we
respected
or
feared
from
conscience
comes
that
feeling
of
obligation
this
i
must
do
this
omit
which
does
not
ask
why
must
i
all
cases
where
a
thing
is
done
with
because
and
why
man
acts
without
conscience
but
not
necessarily
on
that
account
belief
in
authority
is
the
source
of
conscience
which
is
therefore
not
the
voice
of
god
in
the
heart
of
man
but
the
voice
of
some
men
in
man
conquest
of
the
man
who
has
overcome
his
passions
has
entered
into
possession
of
the
most
fruitful
soil
like
the
colonist
who
has
become
lord
over
bogs
and
forests
to
sow
the
seed
of
spiritual
good
works
on
the
soil
of
the
vanquished
passions
is
the
next
and
most
urgent
task
the
conquest
itself
is
a
means
not
an
end
if
it
be
not
so
regarded
all
kind
of
weeds
and
devil

quickly
spring
up
upon
the
fertile

that
has
been
cleared
and

is

wilder
and
more
luxuriant
than
before

have
skill
in

whether
it
be
serving

or

is
what

on
the
seventh
day
of

would
be
a
subject
for
a
great
poet
intercourse
with
origin
of
our
morality
may
still
be
observed
in
our
relations
with
animals
where
advantage
or
the
reverse
do
not
come
into
play
we
have
a
feeling
of
complete
irresponsibility
for
example
we
kill
or
wound
insects
or
let
them
live
and
as
a
rule
think
no
more
about
it
we
are
so
clumsy
that
even
our
gracious
acts
towards
flowers
and
small
animals
are
almost
always
murderous
this
does
not
in
the
least
detract
from
our
pleasure
in
is
the
festival
of
the
small
animals
the
most
sultry
day
of
the
year
there
is
a
swarming
and
crawling
around
us
and
we
without
intention
but
also
without
reflection
crush
here
and
there
a
little
fly
or
winged
animals
do
us
harm
we
strive
to
them
in
every
possible
way
the
means
are
often
cruel
enough
even
without
our
really
intending
them
to
be
is
the
cruelty
of
thoughtlessness
if
they
are
useful
we
turn
them
to
advantage
until
a
more
refined
wisdom
teaches
us
that
certain
animals
amply
reward
a
different
mode
of
treatment
that
of
tending
and
breeding
here
responsibility
first
arises
torturing
is
avoided
in
the
case
of
the
domestic
animal
one
man
is
indignant
if
another
is
cruel
to
his
cow
quite
in
accordance
with
the
primitive
communal
morality
which
sees
the
commonwealth
in
danger
whenever
an
individual
does
wrong
he
who
perceives
any
transgression
in
the
community
fears
indirect
harm
to
himself
thus
we
fear
in
this
case
for
the
quality
of
meat
agriculture
and
means
of
communication
if
we
see
the
domestic
animals
moreover
he
who
is
harsh
to
animals
awakens
a
suspicion
that
he
is
also
harsh
to
men
who
are
weak
inferior
and
incapable
of
revenge
he
is
held
to
be
ignoble
and
deficient
in
the
finer
form
of
pride
thus
arises
a
foundation
of
moral
judgments
and
sentiments
but
the
greatest
contribution
is
made
by
superstition
many
animals
incite
men
by
glances
tones
and
gestures
to
transfer
themselves
into
them
in
imagination
and
some
religions
teach
us
under
certain
circumstances
to
see
in
animals
the
of
human
and
divine
souls
whence
they
recommend
a
nobler
caution
or
even
a
reverential
awe
in
intercourse
with
animals
even
after
the
disappearance
of
this
superstition
the
sentiments
awakened
by
it
continue
to
exercise
their
influence
to
ripen
and
to
as
is
well
known
has
shown
itself
in
this
respect
a
poor
and
retrograde
religion
new
human
beings
there
is
no
greater
banality
than
death
second
in
order
because
it
is
possible
to
die
without
being
born
comes
birth
and
next
comes
marriage
but
these
hackneyed
little
are
always
presented
at
each
of
their
unnumbered
and
innumerable
performances
by
new
actors
and
accordingly
do
not
cease
to
find
interested
spectators
whereas
we
might
well
believe
that
the
whole
audience
of
the
had
long
since
hanged
themselves
to
every
tree
from
sheer
boredom
at
these
performances
so
much
depends
on
new
actors
so
little
on
the
piece
what
is
being
obstinate
shortest
way
is
not
the
straightest
possible
but
that
wherein
favourable
winds
swell
our
sails
so
says
the
wisdom
of
seamen
not
to
follow
his
course
is
obstinate
firmness
of
character
being
then
adulterated
by
stupidity
the
word
is
annoying
that
certain
words
with
which
we
moralists
positively
can
not
dispense
involve
in
themselves
a
kind
of
censorship
of
morals
dating
from
the
times
when
the
most
ordinary
and
natural
impulses
were
denounced
thus
that
fundamental
conviction
that
on
the
waves
of
society
we
either
find
navigable
waters
or
suffer
shipwreck
far
more
through
what
we
appear
than
through
what
we
are
a
conviction
that
must
act
as
guiding
principle
of
all
action
in
relation
to
society
is
branded
with
the
general
word
in
other
words
one
of
the
most
weighty
and
significant
of
qualities
is
branded
with
an
expression
which
denotes
it
as
essentially
empty
and
negative
a
great
thing
is
designated
by
a
diminutive
ay
even
slandered
by
the
strokes
of
caricature
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
must
use
such
words
but
then
we
must
shut
our
ears
to
the
insinuations
of
ancient
habits
the
fatalism
of
the
fatalism
of
the
turk
has
this
fundamental
defect
that
it
contrasts
man
and
fate
as
two
distinct
things
man
says
this
doctrine
may
struggle
against
fate
and
try
to
baffle
it
but
in
the
end
fate
will
always
gain
the
victory
hence
the
most
rational
course
is
to
resign
oneself
or
to
live
as
one
pleases
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
man
is
himself
a
piece
of
fate
when
he
thinks
that
he
is
struggling
against
fate
in
this
way
fate
is
accomplishing
its
ends
even
in
that
struggle
the
combat
is
a
fantasy
but
so
is
the
resignation
in
these
fantasies
are
included
in
fear
felt
by
most
people
of
the
doctrine
that
denies
the
freedom
of
the
will
is
a
fear
of
the
fatalism
of
the
turk
they
imagine
that
man
will
become
weakly
resigned
and
will
stand
before
the
future
with
folded
hands
because
he
can
not
alter
anything
of
the
future
or
that
he
will
give
a
free
rein
to
his
caprices
because
the
predestined
can
not
be
made
worse
by
that
course
the
follies
of
men
are
as
much
a
piece
of
fate
as
are
his
wise
actions
and
even
that
fear
of
belief
in
fate
is
a
fatality
you
yourself
you
poor
timid
creature
are
that
indomitable
which
rules
even
the
gods
whatever
may
happen
you
are
a
curse
or
a
blessing
and
in
any
case
the
fetters
wherein
the
strongest
lies
bound
in
you
the
whole
future
of
the
human
world
is
predestined
and
it
is
no
use
for
you
to
be
frightened
of
yourself
the
advocate
of
the
only
by
our
own
suffering
do
we
become
wise
only
by
others
suffering
do
we
become
good
runs
that
strange
philosophy
which
derives
all
morality
from
pity
and
all
intellectuality
from
the
isolation
of
the
individual
herein
this
philosophy
is
the
unconscious
pleader
for
all
human
deterioration
for
pity
needs
suffering
and
isolation
contempt
of
others
the
moral
ages
when
the
of
different
classes
are
definitely
fixed
like
the
classes
themselves
moralists
will
be
seduced
into
holding
the
moral
too
as
absolute
and
in
delineating
them
accordingly
thus
molière
is
intelligible
as
the
contemporary
of
the
society
of
louis
xiv
in
our
society
of
transitions
and
intermediate
stages
he
would
seem
an
inspired
pedant
the
most
noble
the
first
era
of
the
higher
humanity
courage
is
accounted
the
most
noble
virtue
in
the
next
justice
in
the
third

in
the
fourth
wisdom
in
which
era
do
live
in
which
do
live
a
necessary
man
who
will
not
become
master
of
his
irritability
his
venomous
and
vengeful
feelings
and
his
lust
and
attempts
to
become
master
in
anything
else
is
as
stupid
as
the
farmer
who
lays
out
his
field
beside
a
torrent
without
guarding
against
that
torrent
what
is
truth
melanchthon
we
often
preach
our
faith
when
we
have
lost
it
and
leave
not
a
stone
unturned
to
find
then
we
often
do
not
preach
worst
brother
you
are
really
speaking
like
an
angel
but
that
is
the
idea
of
your
enemies
and
they
apply
it
to
you
then
it
would
be
a
lie
from
the
devil
s
the
habit
of
inexact
observation
sees
contrasts
everywhere
in
nature
for
instance
hot
and
cold
where
there
are
no
contrasts
only
differences
of
degree
this
bad
habit
has
induced
us
to
try
to
understand
and
interpret
even
the
inner
nature
the
intellectual
and
moral
world
in
accordance
with
such
contrasts
an
infinite
amount
of
cruelty
arrogance
harshness
estrangement
and
coldness
has
entered
into
human
emotion
because
men
imagined
they
saw
contrasts
where
there
were
only
transitions
can
we
forgive
can
we
forgive
them
at
all
if
they
know
not
what
they
do
we
have
nothing
to
forgive
but
does
a
man
ever
fully
know
what
he
is
doing
and
if
this
point
at
least
remains
always
debatable
men
never
have
anything
to
forgive
each
other
and
indulgence
is
for
the
reasonable
man
an
impossible
thing
finally
if
the
had
really
known
what
they
did
we
should
still
only
have
a
right
to
forgive
if
we
had
a
right
to
accuse
and
to
punish
but
we
have
not
that
right
habitual
do
we
feel
shame
when
some
virtue
or
merit
is
attributed
to
us
which
as
the
saying
goes
we
have
not
deserved
because
we
appear
to
have
intruded
upon
a
territory
to
which
we
do
not
belong
from
which
we
should
be
excluded
as
from
a
holy
place
or
holy
of
holies
which
ought
not
to
be
trodden
by
our
foot
through
the
errors
of
others
we
have
nevertheless
penetrated
to
it
and
we
are
now
swayed
partly
by
fear
partly
by
reverence
partly
by
surprise
we
do
not
know
whether
we
ought
to
fly
or
to
enjoy
the
blissful
moment
with
all
its
gracious
advantages
in
all
shame
there
is
a
mystery
which
seems
desecrated
or
in
danger
of
desecration
through
us
all
begets
if
it
be
remembered
that
we
have
never
really
deserved
anything
this
feeling
of
shame
provided
that
we
surrender
ourselves
to
this
point
of
view
in
a
spirit
of
christian
contemplation
becomes
habitual
because
upon
such
a
one
god
seems
continually
to
be
conferring
his
blessing
and
his
favours
apart
from
this
christian
interpretation
the
state
of
habitual
shame
will
be
possible
even
to
the
entirely
godless
sage
who
clings
firmly
to
the
basic
and
of
all
action
and
being
if
he
be
treated
as
if
he
had
deserved
this
or
that
he
will
seem
to
have
won
his
way
into
a
higher
order
of
beings
who
do
actually
deserve
something
who
are
free
and
can
really
bear
the
burden
of
responsibility
for
their
own
volition
and
capacity
whoever
says
to
him
you
have
deserved
it
appears
to
cry
out
to
him
you
are
not
a
human
being
but
a
the
most
unskilful
one
man
all
his
real
virtues
are
implanted
on
the
soil
of
his
spirit
of
contradiction
in
another
on
his
incapacity
to
say
no
other
words
on
his
spirit
of
acquiescence
a
third
has
made
all
his
morality
grow
out
of
his
pride
as
a
solitary
a
fourth
from
his
strong
social
instinct
now
supposing
that
the
seeds
of
the
virtues
in
these
four
cases
owing
to
mischance
or
unskilful
teachers
were
not
sown
on
the
soil
of
their
nature
which
provides
them
with
the
richest
and
most
abundant
mould
they
would
become
weak
unsatisfactory
men
devoid
of
morality
and
who
would
have
been
the
most
unskilful
of
teachers
the
evil
genius
of
these
men
the
moral
fanatic
who
thinks
that
the
good
can
only
grow
out
of
the
good
and
on
the
soil
of
the
good
the
cautious
but
if
this
were
known
to
it
would
be
injurious
to
the
you
yourself
call
your
opinions
dangerous
to
those
in
danger
and
yet
you
make
them
public
i
write
so
that
neither
the
mob
nor
the
nor
the
parties
of
all
kinds
can
read
me
so
my
opinions
will
never
be
public
how
do
you
write
then
neither
usefully
nor
the
three
classes
i
have
mentioned

socrates
feels
himself
to
be
a
divine
missionary
but
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
should
not
here
detect
a
tincture
of
that
attic
irony
and
fondness
for
jesting
whereby
this
odious
arrogant
conception
would
be
toned
down
he
talks
of
the
fact
without
images
of
the
gadfly
and
the
horse
are
simple
and
not
sacerdotal
the
real
religious
task
which
he
has
set
god
in
a
hundred
ways
and
see
whether
he
spoke
the
a
bold
and
free
attitude
in
which
the
missionary
walked
by
the
side
of
his
god
this
testing
of
god
is
one
of
the
most
subtle
compromises
between
piety
and
that
has
ever
been
we
do
not
even
need
this
compromise
any
longer
honesty
in
who
cared
a
great
deal
for
the
church
so
far
as
she
could
pay
him
but
like
the
best
men
of
his
time
cared
little
for
the
objects
of
the
church
s
belief
did
not
advance
one
step
to
meet
the
exacting
ecstatic
piety
of
many
of
his
patrons
he
remained
honest
even
in
that
exceptional
picture
which
was
originally
intended
for
a
banner
in
a
sistine
madonna
here
for

wished
to

that

be

either
to

what

nevertheless
maintained
prayer
side

its
belief
in
the

belief
that
makes

to
ask

has
gradually
been

to
its

foundations

the
belief
in

has

and
propagated
still
exists
speech

writings
of
religious
the
priest
s
style
and
general
expression
both
in
speaking
and
writing
do
not
clearly
betray
the
religious
man
we
need
no
longer
take
his
views
upon
religion
and
his
pleading
for
religion
seriously
these
opinions
have
become
powerless
for
him

judging
by
his
style
he
has
at
command
irony
arrogance
malice
hatred
and
all
the
changing
eddies
of
mood
just
like

irreligious
of

will
they
be

his

still
more
irreligious
the

has
been
regarded
as
a
personality
in

the
less
loyal
have
we
been
to
him
men
are
far
more
attached
to
their

to

they
sacrifice

for

even
for

as

looked
upon

in

almost

after
all

the
most
pious
of
men
who
let
slip
that
bitter
cry

god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
worldly
is
possible
to
unhinge
worldly
justice
with
the
doctrine
of
the
complete
and
innocence
of
every
man
an
attempt
has
been
made
in
the
same
direction
on
the
basis
of
the
opposite
doctrine
of
the
full
responsibility
and
guilt
of
every
man
it
was
the
founder
of
christianity
who
wished
to
abolish
worldly
justice
and
banish
judgment
and
punishment
from
the
world
for
he
understood
all
guilt
as
sin
is
an
outrage
against
god
and
not
against
the
world
on
the
other
hand
he
considered
every
man
in
a
broad
sense
and
almost
in
every
sense
a
sinner
the
guilty
however
are
not
to
be
the
judges
of
their
his
rules
of
equity
decided
thus
all
dispensers
of
worldly
justice
were
in
his
eyes
as
culpable
as
those
they
condemned
and
their
air
of
guiltlessness
appeared
to
him
hypocritical
and
pharisaical
moreover
he
looked
to
the
motives
and
not
to
the
results
of
actions
and
thought
that
only
one
was
enough
to
give
a
verdict
on
or
as
he
expressed
it
god
an
affectation
in
who
wishes
to
sever
his
connection
with
a
party
or
a
creed
thinks
it
necessary
for
him
to
refute
it
this
is
a
most
arrogant
notion
the
only
thing
necessary
is
that
he
should
clearly
see
what
tentacles
hitherto
held
him
to
this
party
or
creed
and
no
longer
hold
him
what
views
impelled
him
to
it
and
now
impel
him
in
some
other
directions
we
have
not
joined
the
party
or
creed
on
strict
grounds
of
knowledge
we
should
not
affect
this
attitude
on
parting
from
it
either
saviour
and
his
knowledge
of
the
human
soul
the
founder
of
christianity
was
as
is
natural
not
without
many
great
deficiencies
and
prejudices
and
as
physician
of
the
soul
was
addicted
to
that
disreputable
laical
belief
in
a
universal
medicine
in
his
methods
he
sometimes
resembles
that
dentist
who
wishes
to
heal
all
pain
by
extracting
the
tooth
thus
for
example
he
assails
sensuality
with
the
advice
if
thine
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
there
still
remains
the
distinction
that
the
dentist
at
least
attains
his
for
the
in
so
clumsy
a
fashion
that
he
becomes
ridiculous
whereas
the
christian
who
follows
that
advice
and
thinks
he
has
killed
his
sensuality
is
wrong
for
his
sensuality
still
lives
in
an
uncanny
vampire
form
and
torments
him
in
hideous
disguises
morning
the
prisoners
entered
the
yard
for
work
but
the
warder
was
not
there
some
as
their
manner
was
set
to
work
at
once
others
stood
idle
and
gazed
defiantly
around
then
one
of
them
strode
forward
and
cried
work
as
much
as
you
will
or
do
nothing
it
all
comes
to
the
same
your
secret
machinations
have
come
to
light
the
warder
has
been
keeping
his
eye
on
you
of
late
and
will
cause
a
terrible
judgment
to
be
passed
upon
you
in
a
few
days
time
you
know
is
of
a
cruel
and
resentful
disposition
but
now
listen
you
have
mistaken
me
hitherto
i
am
not
what
i
seem
but
far
am
the
son
of
the
warder
and
can
get
anything
i
like
out
of
him
i
can
save
i
will
save
you
but
remember
this
i
will
only
save
those
of
you
who
that
i
am
the
son
of
the
prison
warder
the
rest
may
reap
the
fruits
of
their
well
said
an
old
prisoner
after
an
interval
of
silence
what
can
it
matter
to
you
whether
we
believe
you
or
not
if
you
are
really
the
son
and
can
do
what
you
say
then
put
in
a
good
word
for
us
all
that
would
be
a
real
kindness
on
your
part
but
have
done
with
all
talk
of
belief
and
unbelief
what
is
more
cried
a
younger
man
i
don
t
believe
him
he
has
only
got
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
i
ll
wager
that
in
a
week
s
time
we
shall
find
ourselves
in
the
same
place
as
we
are
and
the
warder
will
know
and
if
the
warder
ever
knew
anything
he
knows
it
no
longer
said
the
last
of
the
prisoners
coming
down
into
the
yard
at
that
moment
for
he
has
just
died
ah
ha
cried
several
in
confusion
ah
ha
sir
son
sir
son
how
stands
it
now
with
your
title
are
we
by
any
chance
prisoners
now
i
told
you
answered
the
man
gently
i
will
set
free
all
who
believe
in
me
as
surely
as
my
father
still
prisoners
did
not
laugh
but
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
left
him
to
himself
the
persecutors
of
conceived
and
calvin
followed
up
the
idea
that
countless
creatures
have
been
predestined
to
damnation
from
time
immemorial
and
that
this
fair
world
was
made
in
order
that
the
glory
of
god
might
be
manifested
therein
so
heaven
and
hell
and
mankind
merely
exist
to
satisfy
the
vanity
of
god
what
a
cruel
insatiable
vanity
must
have
smouldered
in
the
soul
of
the
first
or
second
thinker
of
such
a
thought
then
after
all
remained
persecutor
of
god
all
goes
well
the
time
will
come
when
in
order
to
advance
themselves
on
the
path
of
moral
reason
men
will
rather
take
up
the
of
socrates
than
the
bible
and
when
montaigne
and
horace
will
be
used
as
pioneers
and
guides
for
the
understanding
of
socrates
the
simplest
and
most
enduring
of
interpretative
sages
in
him
converge
the
roads
of
the
most
different
philosophic
modes
of
life
which
are
in
truth
the
modes
of
the
different
temperaments
crystallised
by
reason
and
habit
and
all
ultimately
directed
towards
the
delight
in
life
and
in
self
the
apparent
conclusion
is
that
the
most
peculiar
thing
about
socrates
was
his
share
in
all
the
temperaments
socrates
excels
the
founder
of
christianity
by
virtue
of
his
merry
style
of
seriousness
and
by
that
wisdom
of
sheer
roguish
pranks
which
constitutes
the
best
state
of
soul
in
a
man
moreover
he
had
a
superior
intelligence
learning
to
write
age
of
good
speaking
is
over
because
the
age
of
culture
is
over
the
limit
allowed
by
aristotle
to
the
great
which
the
must
be
able
to
make
himself
heard
by
the
whole
assembled
us
as
little
as
do
any
us
who
even
wish
to
be
understood
beyond
the
boundaries
of
nations
therefore
every
one
who
is
of
a
good
european
turn
of
mind
must
learn
to
well
and
to
write
better
and
better
he
can
not
help
himself
he
must
learn
that
even
if
he
was
born
in
germany
where
bad
writing
is
looked
upon
as
a
national
privilege
better
writing
means
better
thinking
always
to
discover
matter
more
worthy
of
communication
to
be
able
to
communicate
it
properly
to
be
translateable
into
the
tongues
of
neighbouring
nations
to
make
oneself
comprehensible
to
foreigners
who
learn
our
language
to
work
with
the
view
of
making
all
that
is
good
common
property
and
of
giving
free
access
everywhere
to
the
free
finally
to
pave
the
way
for
that
still
remote
state
of
things
when
the
great
task
shall
come
for
good
and
guardianship
of
the
universal
preaches
the
opposite
doctrine
of
not
troubling
about
good
writing
and
good
reading
both
virtues
grow
together
and
decline
together
is
really
showing
the
peoples
a
way
of
becoming
more
and
more
he
is
intensifying
the
malady
of
this
century
and
is
a
foe
to
good
europeans
a
foe
to
free
spirits
the
theory
of
the
best
theory
of
the
best
style
may
at
one
time
be
the
theory
of
finding
the
expression
by
which
we
transfer
every
mood
of
ours
to
the
reader
and
the
listener
at
another
it
may
be
the
theory
of
finding
expressions
for
the
more
desirable
human
moods
the
communication
and
transference
of
which
one
desires
the
mood
of
a
man
moved
from
the
depth
of
his
heart
intellectually
cheerful
bright
and
sincere
who
has
conquered
his
passions
this
will
be
the
theory
of
the
best
style
a
theory
that
corresponds
to
the
good
man
paying
attention
to
movement
of
the
sentences
shows
whether
the
author
be
tired
individual
expressions
may
nevertheless
be
still
strong
and
good
because
they
were
invented
earlier
and
for
their
own
sake
when
the
thought
first
flashed
across
the
author
s
mind
this
is
frequently
the
case
with
goethe
who
too
often
dictated
when
he
was
tired
already
and
german
prose
is
still
very
young
goethe
declares
that
wieland
is
its
father
so
young
and
already
so
ugly
but
so
far
as
i
am
aware
bishop
ulfilas
already
wrote
german
prose
which
must
therefore
be
fifteen
hundred
years
old
so
old
and
still
so
ugly
original
prose
which
is
really
not
fashioned
on
any
pattern
and
must
be
considered
an
original
creation
of
german
taste
should
give
the
eager
advocate
of
a
future
original
german
culture
an
indication
of
how
real
german
dress
german
society
german
furniture
german
meals
would
look
without
the
imitation
of
one
who
had
long
reflected
on
these
vistas
finally
cried
in
great
horror
but
heaven
help
us
perhaps
we
already
have
that
original
we
don
t
like
to
talk
about
it
forbidden
should
never
read
anything
written
by
those
arrogant
wiseacres
and
who
have
the
detestable
vice
of
logical
paradox
they
apply
formulæ
just
where
everything
is
really
improvised
at
random
and
built
in
the
air
therefore
with
them
means
you
idiot
of
a
reader
this
therefore
does
not
exist
for
you
but
only
for
the
answer
to
this
is
you
idiot
of
a
writer
then
why
do
you
write
displaying
one
s
one
who
wishes
to
display
his
wit
thereby
proclaims
that
he
has
also
a
plentiful
lack
of
wit
that
vice
which
clever
frenchmen
have
of
adding
a
touch
of
to
their
best
ideas
arises
from
a
desire
to
be
considered
richer
than
they
really
are
they
wish
to
be
carelessly
generous
as
if
weary
of
continual
spending
from
overfull
treasuries
french
and
german
misfortune
of
the
french
and
german
literature
of
the
last
hundred
years
is
that
the
germans
ran
away
too
early
from
the
french
school
and
the
french
later
on
went
too
early
to
the
german
school
our
of
the
cultured
nations
has
so
bad
a
prose
as
the
german
when
clever
frenchmen
say
there
is
no
german
prose
we
ought
really
not
to
be
angry
for
this
criticism
is
more
polite
than
we
deserve
if
we
look
for
reasons
we
come
at
last
to
the
strange
phenomenon
that
the
german
knows
only
improvised
prose
and
has
no
conception
of
any
other
he
simply
can
not
understand
the
italian
who
says
that
prose
is
as
much
harder
than
poetry
as
the
representation
of
naked
beauty
is
harder
to
the
sculptor
than
that
of
draped
beauty
verse
images
rhythm
and
rhyme
need
honest
even
the
german
realises
and
he
is
not
inclined
to
set
a
very
high
value
on
extempore
poetry
but
the
notion
of
working
at
a
page
of
prose
as
at
a
statue
sounds
to
him
like
a
tale
from
fairyland
the
grand
grand
style
comes
into
being
when
the
beautiful
wins
a
victory
over
the
monstrous
do
not
realise
in
the
case
of
distinguished
minds
wherein
lies
the
excellence
of
their
expression
their
turn
of
phrase
until
we
can
say
what
word
every
mediocre
writer
would
inevitably
have
hit
upon
in
expressing
the
same
idea
all
great
artists
in
steering
their
car
show
themselves
prone
to
dodge
and
leave
the
track
but
never
to
fall
over
something
like
neutralises
and
takes
out
the
taste
of
other
food
and
is
therefore
necessary
to
every
long
meal
in
all
works
of
art
there
must
be
something
like
bread
in
order
that
they
may
produce
divers
effects
if
these
effects
followed
one
another
without
occasional
pauses
and
intervals
they
would
soon
make
us
weary
and
provoke
fact
a
long
meal
of
art
would
then
be
impossible

feeling
and
seriousness
but
in
dispensing
them
poured
over
them
a
nauseous
sauce
of
tears
had
even
wit
but
unfortunately
for
his
ardent
desire
for
it
far
too
he
drives
the
reader
to
despair
by
his
very
lack
of
wit
in
short
he
was
the
bright
weed
that
shot
up
overnight
in
the
fair
pleasaunces
of
schiller
and
goethe
he
was
a
good
comfortable
man
and
yet
a
destiny
a
destiny
in
a
palate
for
order
to
enjoy
a
work
of
the
past
as
its
contemporaries
enjoyed
it
one
must
have
a
palate
for
the
prevailing
taste
of
the
age
which
it
attacked
writers
are
neither
spirit
nor
wine
but
spirits
of
wine
they
can
flare
up
and
then
they
give
warmth
the
interpretative
sense
of
taste
as
the
true
interpretative
sense
often
talks
the
other
senses
over
to
its
point
of
view
and
imposes
upon
them
its
laws
and
customs
at
table
one
can
receive
disclosures
about
the
most
subtle
secrets
of
the
arts
it
suffices
to
observe
what
tastes
good
and
when
and
after
what
and
how
long
it

had
a
genuine
french
talent
and
as
writer
went
most
assiduously
to
the
french
school
he
knows
well
how
to
arrange
and
display
his
wares
in
his
without
this
true
art
his
thoughts
like
the
objects
of
them
would
have
remained
rather
in
the
dark
nor
would
the
general
loss
be
great
his
art
however
has
taught
many
especially
the
last
generation
of
german
scholars
and
has
given
enjoyment
to
a
countless
number
it
is
true
his
disciples
had
no
need
to
learn
from
him
as
they
often
did
his
unpleasant
tone
with
its
mingling
of
petulance
and
is
now
unanimous
on
lessing
as
lyric
poet
and
will
some
day
be
unanimous
on
lessing
as
dramatic
undesirable
an
author
is
vexed
by
those
stolid
awkward
readers
who
always
fall
at
every
place
where
they
stumble
and
always
hurt
themselves
when
they
fall
poets
thoughts
of
real
poets
always
go
about
with
a
veil
on
like
egyptian
women
only
the
deep
of
thought
looks
out
freely
through
the
thoughts
are
as
a
rule
not
of
such
value
as
is
supposed
we
have
to
pay
for
the
veil
and
for
our
own
curiosity
into
the
bargain
write
simply
and
details
colour
in
depicting
the
make
a
present
of
all
these
to
the
author
because
we
bring
them
with
us
and
set
them
down
to
the
credit
of
his
book
provided
he
makes
us
some
compensation
wrote
german
better
than
any
one
else
and
had
the
genuine
adequacies
and
inadequacies
of
the
master
his
translations
of
the
letters
of
cicero
and
lucian
are
the
best
in
the
language
his
ideas
however
add
nothing
to
our
store
of
thought
we
can
endure
his
cheerful
moralities
as
little
as
his
cheerful
immoralities
for
both
are
very
closely
connected
the
men
who
enjoyed
them
were
at
bottom
better
men
than
we
are
but
also
a
good
deal
heavier
they
an
author
of
this
sort
the
germans
did
not
need
goethe
and
therefore
can
not
make
proper
use
of
him
we
have
only
to
consider
the
best
of
our
statesmen
and
artists
in
this
light
none
of
them
had
or
have
had
goethe
as
their
teacher
rare
conciseness
repose
and
you
find
these
qualities
in
an
author
cry
halt
and
celebrate
a
great
festival
in
the
desert
it
will
be
long
before
you
have
such
a
treat
again
the
treasure
of
german
from
goethe
s
writings
and
especially
goethe
s
conversations
with
eckermann
the
best
german
book
in
existence
what
german
prose
literature
remains
that
is
worth
reading
over
and
over
again
lichtenberg

the
first

of
my
adalbert

gottfried
keller
s
of
there
for
the
time
being
it
comes
to
an
end
literary
and
colloquial
art
of
writing
demands
first
and
foremost
substitutions
for
the
means
of
expression
which
speech
alone
other
words
for
gestures
accent
intonation
and
look
hence
literary
style
is
quite
different
from
colloquial
style
and
far
more
difficult
because
it
has
to
make
itself
as
intelligible
as
the
latter
with
fewer
accessaries
demosthenes

for
at

they
contain
more
of
the
roman

than
we
can
endure
caution
in
authors
do
not
know
that
a
good
expression
or
idea
only
looks
well
among
its
peers
that
an
excellent
quotation
may
spoil
whole
pages
nay
the
whole

for
it

to
cry
warningly
to
the
reader

am
the
precious
stone
and

to
live
in
its
own
is
the
moral
of
a
choice
style
how
should
errors
be
enunciated
may
dispute
whether
it
be
more
injurious
for
errors
to
be
enunciated
badly
or
as
well
as
the
best
truths
it
is
certain
that
in
the
former
case
they
are
doubly
harmful
to
the
brain
and
are
less
easily
removed
from
it
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
so
certain
of
effect
as
in
the
latter
case
they
are
in
fact
less
contagious
limiting
and
limited
and
diminished
the
horizon
of
his
subject
but
allowed
individual
scenes
to
expand
and
blossom
out
later
the
tragedians
are
constantly
renewing
this
process
each
takes
his
material
in
ever
smaller
and
smaller
fragments
than
his
predecessor
did
but
each
attains
a
greater
wealth
of
blooms
within
the
narrow
hedges
of
these
sequestered
garden
enclosures
literature
and
morality
mutually
can
show
from
greek
literature
by
what
forces
the
greek
spirit
developed
how
it
entered
upon
different
channels
and
where
it
became
enfeebled
all
this
also
depicts
to
us
how
greek
morality
proceeded
and
how
all
morality
will
proceed
how
it
was
at
first
a
constraint
and
displayed
cruelty
then
became
gradually
milder
how
a
pleasure
in
certain
actions
in
certain
forms
and
conventions
arose
and
from
this
again
a
propensity
for
solitary
exercise
for
solitary
possession
how
the
track
becomes
crowded
and
overcrowded
with
competitors
how
satiety
enters
in
new
objects
of
struggle
and
ambition
are
sought
and
forgotten
aims
are
awakened
to
life
how
the
drama
is
repeated
and
the
spectators
become
altogether
weary
of
looking
on
because
the
whole
gamut
seems
to
have
been
run
then
comes
a
stoppage
an
expiration
and
the
rivulets
are
lost
in
the
sand
the
end
or
at
any
rate
end
has
come
what
landscapes
give
permanent
and
such
a
landscape
has
features
eminently
suited
for
painting
but
i
can
not
find
the
formula
for
it
it
remains
beyond
my
grasp
as
a
whole
i
notice
that
all
landscapes
which
please
me
permanently
have
a
simple
geometrical
scheme
of
lines
underneath
all
their
complexity
without
such
a
mathematical
substratum
no
scenery
becomes
artistically
pleasing
perhaps
this
rule
may
be
applied
symbolically
to
human
beings
reading
ability
to
read
aloud
involves
of
necessity
the
ability
to
declaim
everywhere
we
must
apply
pale
tints
but
we
must
determine
the
degree
of
pallor
in
close
relation
to
the
richly
and
deeply
coloured
background
that
always
hovers
before
our
eyes
and
acts
as
our
other
words
in
accordance
with
the
way
in
which
we
should
the
same
passages
that
is
why
we
must
be
able
to
declaim
the
dramatic
who
has
not
the
four
subtler
senses
of
art
tries
to
understand
everything
with
the
fifth
sense
which
is
the
coarsest
of
dramatic
sense
fails
to
be
all
that
he
made
people
think
he
was
and
himself
wished
to
think
he
was
he
was
no
great
thinker
or
discoverer
no
newly
fertile
soil
with
the
unexhausted
strength
of
a
virgin
forest
but
he
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
the
power
of
scenting
the
future
he
saw
and
picked
the
of
the
seasons
earlier
than
all
others
and
they
then
believed
that
he
had
made
them
grow
between
darkness
and
light
youth
and
age
his
mind
was
like
a
hunter
on
the
watch
looking
everywhere
for
transitions
depressions
convulsions
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
internal
growth
the
unrest
of
spring
drove
him
to
and
fro
but
he
was
himself
not
the
times
indeed
he
had
some
inkling
of
this
and
yet
would
fain
not
have
believed
the
ambitious
priest
who
would
have
so
gladly
been
the
intellectual
pope
of
his
epoch
this
is
his
despair
he
seems
to
have
lived
long
as
a
pretender
to
several
kingdoms
or
even
to
a
universal
monarchy
he
had
his
following
which
believed
in
him
among
others
the
young
goethe
but
whenever
crowns
were
really
distributed
he
was
passed
over
kant
goethe
and
then
the
first
true
german
historians
and
scholars
robbed
him
of
what
he
thought
he
had
reserved
for
himself
although
in
silence
and
secret
he
often
thought
the
reverse
just
when
he
doubted
in
himself
he
gladly
clothed
himself
in
dignity
and
enthusiasm
these
were
often
in
him
mere
garments
which
had
to
hide
a
great
deal
and
also
to
deceive
and
comfort
him
he
really
had
fire
and
enthusiasm
but
his
ambition
was
far
greater
it
blew
impatiently
at
the
fire
which
flickered
crackled
and
flickers
crackles
and
he
yearned
for
the
great
flame
which
never
broke
out
he
did
not
sit
at
the
table
of
the
genuine
creators
and
his
ambition
did
not
admit
of
his
sitting
modestly
among
those
who
simply
enjoy
thus
he
was
a
restless
spirit
the
taster
of
all
intellectual
dishes
which
were
collected
by
the
germans
from
every
quarter
and
every
age
in
the
course
of
half
a
century
never
really
happy
and
satisfied
herder
was
also
too
often
ill
and
then
at
times
envy
sat
by
his
bed
and
hypocrisy
paid
her
visit
as
well
he
always
had
an
air
of
being
scarred
and
crippled
and
he
lacked
simple
stalwart
manliness
more
completely
than
any
of
the
classical
scent
of
word
has
its
scent
there
is
a
harmony
and
discord
of
scents
and
so
too
of
words
the
natural
style
is
an
offence
to
the
lover
of
the
style
a
will
never
again
read
an
author
of
whom
one
can
suspect
that
he
to
make
a
book
but
only
those
writers
whose
thoughts
unexpectedly
became
a
book
the
artistic
of
homer
is
convention
and
the
same
is
the
case
with
all
the
greek
artists
who
had
no
reason
for
falling
into
the
modern
craze
for
originality
they
had
no
fear
of
convention
for
after
all
convention
was
a
link
between
them
and
their
public
conventions
are
the
artistic
means
for
the
understanding
of
the
hearer
the
common
speech
learnt
with
much
toil
whereby
the
artist
can
really
communicate
his
ideas
all
the
more
when
he
wishes
like
the
greek
poets
and
musicians
to
conquer
at
once
with
each
of
his
works
since
he
is
accustomed
to
compete
publicly
with
one
or
two
rivals
the
first
condition
is
that
he
must
be
understood
at
once
and
this
is
only
possible
by
means
of
convention
what
the
artist
devises
beyond
convention
he
offers
of
his
own
free
will
and
takes
a
risk
his
success
at
best
resulting
in
the
of
a
new
convention
as
a
rule
originality
is
marvelled
at
sometimes
even
worshipped
but
seldom
understood
a
stubborn
avoidance
of
convention
means
a
desire
not
to
be
understood
what
then
is
the
object
of
the
modern
craze
for
originality
artists
affectation
of
scientific
like
other
german
artists
fancied
that
if
a
man
had
intellect
he
was
entitled
to
improvise
even
with
the
pen
on
all
difficult
subjects
so
there
we
see
his
prose
every
way
a
model
of
how
to
attack
scientific
questions
of
æsthetics
and
ethics
and
a
danger
for
young
readers
who
in
their
admiration
for
schiller
the
poet
have
not
the
courage
to
think
meanly
of
schiller
the
thinker
and
temptation
to
traverse
for
once
the
forbidden
paths
and
to
have
his
say
in
science
as
well
is
easy
and
pardonable
in
the
artist
for
even
the
ablest
artist
from
time
to
time
finds
his
handicraft
and
his
workshop
unendurable
this
temptation
is
so
strong
that
it
makes
the
artist
show
all
the
world
what
no
one
wishes
to
see
that
his
little
chamber
of
thought
is
cramped
and
untidy
why
not
indeed
he
does
not
live
there
he
proceeds
to
show
that
the
storeroom
of
his
knowledge
is
partly
empty
partly
filled
with
lumber
why
not
indeed
this
condition
does
not
really
become
the
badly
in
particular
the
artist
shows
that
for
the
very
easiest
exercises
of
scientific
method
which
are
accessible
even
to
beginners
his
joints
are
too
stiff
and
untrained
even
of
that
he
need
not
really
be
ashamed
on
the
other
hand
he
often
develops
no
mean
art
in
imitating
all
the
mistakes
vices
and
base
pedantries
that
are
practised
in
the
scientific
community
in
the
belief
that
these
belong
to
the
appearance
of
the
thing
if
not
to
the
thing
itself
this
is
the
very
point
that
is
so
amusing
in
artists
writing
that
the
artist
involuntarily
acts
as
his
vocation
demands
he
parodies
the
scientific
and
inartistic
natures
towards
science
he
should
show
no
attitude
but
that
of
parody
in
so
far
as
he
is
an
artist
and
only
an
artist
the
little
sempstress
is
seduced
and
plunged
into
despair
a
great
scholar
of
all
the
four
faculties
is
the
that
can
not
have
happened
in
the
ordinary
course
surely
no
certainly
not
without
the
aid
of
the
devil
incarnate
the
great
scholar
would
never
have
achieved
the
this
really
destined
to
be
the
greatest
german
tragic
idea
as
one
hears
it
said
among
germans
for
goethe
even
this
idea
was
too
terrible
his
kind
heart
could
not
avoid
placing
the
little
sempstress
the
good
soul
that
forgot
itself
but
once
near
to
the
saints
after
her
involuntary
death
even
the
great
scholar
the
good
man
with
the
dark
impulse
is
brought
into
heaven
in
the
nick
of
time
by
a
trick
which
is
played
upon
the
devil
at
the
decisive
moment
in
heaven
the
lovers
find
themselves
again
goethe
once
said
that
his
nature
was
too
conciliatory
for
really
tragic
subjects
are
there
german
classics
observes
somewhere
that
the
word
classic
does
not
suit
the
genius
of
certain
literatures
for
instance
nobody
could
talk
seriously
of
german
do
our
german
publishers
who
are
about
to
add
fifty
more
to
the
fifty
german
classics
we
are
told
to
accept
say
to
that
does
it
not
almost
seem
as
if
one
need
only
have
been
dead
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
lie
a
lawful
prey
to
the
public
in
order
to
hear
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
the
trumpet
of
resurrection
as
a
classic
and
this
in
an
age
and
a
nation
where
at
least
five
out
of
the
six
great
fathers
of
its
literature
are
undoubtedly
antiquated
or
becoming
there
being
any
need
for
the
age
or
the
nation
to
be
ashamed
of
this
for
those
writers
have
given
way
before
the
strength
of
our
that
be
considered
in
all
fairness
as
i
have
indicated
i
do
not
include
he
belongs
to
a
higher
species
than
national
literatures
hence
life
revival
and
decay
do
not
enter
into
the
reckoning
in
his
relations
with
his
countrymen
he
lived
and
now
lives
but
for
the
few
for
the
majority
he
is
nothing
but
a
flourish
of
vanity
which
is
trumpeted
from
time
to
time
across
the
border
into
foreign
ears
goethe
not
merely
a
great
and
good
man
but
a
is
in
german
history
an
interlude
without
a
sequel
who
for
instance
would
be
able
to
point
to
any
trace
of
goethe
s
influence
in
german
politics
of
the
last
seventy
years
whereas
the
influence
certainly
of
schiller
and
perhaps
of
lessing
can
be
traced
in
the
political
world
but
what
of
those
five
others
klopstock
in
a
most
honourable
way
became
out
of
date
even
in
his
own
lifetime
and
so
completely
that
the
meditative
book
of
his
later
years
republic
of
has
never
been
taken
seriously
from
that
day
to
this
herder
s
misfortune
was
that
his
writings
were

of

it
is
a
sign
of
obsolescence
when
a
book
descends
to
people
of
less
and
less
mature
what
is
it
that
has
thrust
these
five
into
the
background
so
that
men
of

no
longer
read

a
riper

a

reverence
for
the

the

the
very

which
these
five

or
twenty

of
lesser

now
like

something
of
the

all
that

they
remain

the

its

it
has
one
that
we
should
like
to
guess
everywhere
that
i
look
i
read
words
and
hints
of
words
but
i
do
not
know
where
begins
the
sentence
that
solves
the
riddle
of
all
these
hints
so
i
get
a
stiff
neck
in
trying
to
discover
whether
i
should
start
reading
from
this
or
that
point
against
innovators
in
use
of
neologisms
or
archaisms
the
preference
for
the
rare
and
the
bizarre
the
attempt
to
enrich
rather
than
to
limit
the
vocabulary
are
always
signs
either
of
an
immature
or
of
a
corrupted
taste
a
noble
poverty
but
a
masterly
freedom
within
the
limits
of
that
modest
wealth
distinguishes
the
greek
artists
in
oratory
they
wish
to
have
less

the

richest
in

they
wish
to
have
that
little
the
reckoning
up
of
their
archaic
and
exotic
forms
is
soon
done
but
we
never
cease
marvelling
if
we
have
an
eye
for
their
light
and
delicate
manner
in
handling
the
commonplace
and
apparently
long
outworn
elements
in
word
and
phrase
gloomy
and
serious
who
commits
his
sufferings
to
paper
becomes
a
gloomy
author
but
he
becomes
a
serious
one
if
he
tells
us
what
he
suffered
and
why
he
is
now

never
be
convinced
of
the

classical
weakest
point
in

is
that
it
is
written
too
much
in
the

in

rather
the
opposite
tendency
like
every
man
of
moral
significance
it
loves
to
check
emotion
on
its
way
and
not
let
it
run
its
course
to
the
very
end
this
modesty
of
letting

most
clearly
to
be

in

this
is
however
due
to
the
bad
training

they
bear
witness
to

in
the

of

we
must
ask
what

he
imposes
upon
himself
and
makes

to
his

so
as
to
find
imitators

always
a

of
this
kind

that
hard
for
themselves
and
then
to
spread
a
false
notion
that
it

is
the
trick
that
they
wish
to
show
us
even
in

we
may
perceive
a
wealth
of
inherited
formulæ
and
laws
of
epic
narration
within
the
circle
of
which
he
had
to
dance
and
he
himself
created
new
conventions
for
them
that
came
after
this
was
the
discipline
of
the
greek
poets
first
to
impose
upon
themselves
a
manifold
constraint
by
means
of
the
earlier
poets
then
to
invent
in
addition
a
new
constraint
to
impose
it
upon
themselves
and
cheerfully
to
overcome
it
so
that
constraint
and

stands
on
the
threshold

turns
from
thence
to
look
at
the
middle

who
in
the
invention
of
his
music
was
bold
original
truthful
powerful
inclined
to

akin
to

even

he
went
just
as

as
the
limit
which

sets
to

only
wrote

that
has
no

in
quite
a

relation

he
finds
his
inspiration
not
in

in
gazing
at
life
at
the
most
stirring

leaves
behind
it
a
soul
dazed
with
narcotics
longing

this
is
particularly
the

with

which
inspires
in
us
bitterness

together
and
forces
us
to
sip
again

again

at

so
that
for

will
continue

at
his

in

find
a
store

lie
in

modern
musical
tragic
or

execution
of
music
acquires
its
character
by
imitating
the
gesture
of
the
great
sinner
such
as
christianity
conceives
and
desires
him
the
passionately
brooding
man
distracted
by
the
agonies

now
flying
in
terror
now
clutching
with
delight
now
standing
still
in
all
the
other
marks
of
great
sinfulness
only
on
the
christian
assumption
that
all
men
are
great
sinners
and
do
nothing
but
sin
could
we
justify
the
application
of
this
style
of
execution
to
music
so
far
music
would
be
the
reflection
of
all
the
actions
and
impulses
of
man
and
would
continually
have
to
express
by
gestures
the
language
of
the
great
sinner
at
such
a
performance
a
listener
who
was
not
enough
of
a
christian
to
understand
this
logic
might
indeed
cry
out
in
horror
for
the

how
did

way

felix

is
that
chopin
applies

not

to

he
admitted
the
validity
of

in

however
is
doing
violence
to
euterpe
who
poor
muse
wants
to
have
her
eyes
and
ears
where
the
other
muses
have
theirs
victory
and
in
the
æsthetic
wars
which
artists
provoke
by
their
works
and
apologias
for
their
works
just
as
is
the
case
in
real

it
is

and
not

that
decides
all
the

now
assumes
as
a
historical
fact
that
in
his
dispute
with
piccini
gluck
was
in
the
right
at
any
rate
he
was
victorious
and
had
might
on
his
side
of
the
principle
of
musical
the
modern
musical
performers
really
believe
that
the
supreme
law
of
their
art
is
to
give
every
piece
as
much
as
is
possible
and
to
make
it
speak
at
all
costs
a
dramatic
language
is
not
this
principle
when
applied
for
example
to
mozart
a
veritable
sin
against
the
gay
sunny
airy
delicate
mozart
whose
seriousness
was
of
a
kindly
and
not
order
whose
pictures
do
not
try
to
leap
from
the
wall
and
drive
away
the
beholder
in
panic
or
do
you
think
that
all
mozart
s
music
is
identical
with
the
in
and
not
only
mozart
s
but
all
music
reply
that
the
advantage
of
your
principle
lies
in
its
greater
you
would
be
right
if
there
did
not
remain
the
has
the
effect
operated
and
should
an
artist
of
the
first
rank
desire
to
produce
his
effect
never
on
the
populace
never
on
the
immature
never
on
the
morbidly
sensitive
never
on
the
diseased
and
above
on
the
the
music
of
music
with
its
strong
lungs
and
weak
nerves
is
frightened
above
all
things
of
itself
where
music
is
at
reaches
its
mark
only
among
men
who
have
not
the
ability
or
the
right
to
argue
accordingly
its
chief
promoters
are
princes
whose
aim
is
that
there
should
be
not
much
criticism
nor
even
much
thought
in
their
neighbourhood
next
come
societies
which
under
some
pressure
or
other
political
or
religious
are
forced
to
become
habituated
to
silence
and
so
feel
all
the
greater
need
of
spells
to
charm
away
emotional
spells
being
generally
eternal
and
eternal
music
thirdly
we
must
reckon
whole
nations
in
which
there
is
no
society
but
all
the
greater
number
of
individuals
with
a
bent
towards
solitude
mystical
thinking
and
a
reverence
for
all
that
is
inexpressible
these
are
the
genuine
musical
the
greeks
as
a
nation
delighting
in
talking
and
argument
accordingly
put
up
with
music
only
as
an
d
to
those
arts
which
really
admit
of
discussion
and
dispute
about
music
one
can
hardly
even
clearly
the
pythagoreans
who
in
so
many
respects
were
exceptional
greeks
are
said
to
have
been
great
musicians
this
was
the
school
that
invented
a
silence
but
did
not
invent
a
dialectic
sentimentality
in
may
be
ever
so
much
in
sympathy
with
serious
and
profound
music
yet
nevertheless
or
perhaps
all
the
more
for
that
reason
we
shall
at
occasional
moments
be
overpowered
entranced
and
almost
melted
away
by
its
mean
by
those
simple
italian
operatic
airs
which
in
spite
of
all
their
monotony
of
rhythm
and
childishness
of
harmony
seem
at
times
to
sing
to
us
like
the
very
soul
of
music
admit
this
or
not
as
you
please
you
pharisees
of
good
taste
it
is
so
and
it
is
my
present
task
to
propound
the
riddle
that
it
is
so
and
to
nibble
a
little
myself
at
the
childhood
s
days
we
tasted
the
honey
of
many
things
for
the
first
time
never
was
honey
so
good
as
then
it
seduced
us
to
life
into
abundant
life
in
the
guise
of
the
first
spring
the
first
flower
the
first
butterfly
the
first
friendship
in
our
ninth
year
or
heard
our
first
music
and
this
was
the
first
that
we
understood
thus
the
simplest
and
most
childish
tunes
that
were
not
much
more
than
a
sequel
to
the
nurse
s
lullaby
and
the
strolling
fiddler
s
tune
were
our
first
experience
for
even
the
most
trifling
revelations
of
art
need
preparation
and
study
there
is
no
immediate
effect
of
art
whatever
charming
fables
the
philosophers
may
tell
our
sensation
on
hearing
these
italian
airs
is
associated
with
those
first
musical
raptures
the
strongest
of
our
lives
the
bliss
of
childhood
and
its
flight
the
feeling
that
our
most
precious
possession
can
never
be
brought
back
all
this
moves
the
chords
of
the
soul
more
strongly
than
the
most
serious
and
profound
music
can
move
mingling
of
æsthetic
pleasure
with
moral
pain
which
nowadays
it
is
customary
to
call
rather
too
haughtily
i
think
sentimentality
is
the
mood
of
faust
at
the
end
of
the
first
sentimentality
of
the
listener
is
all
to
the
advantage
of
italian
music
it
is
a
feeling
which
the
experienced
connoisseurs
in
art
the
pure
æsthetes
like
to
almost
all
music
has
a
magical
effect
only
when
we
hear
it
speak
the
language
of
our
own
accordingly
it
seems
to
the
layman
that
all
the
old
music
is
continually
growing
better
and
that
all
the
latest
is
of
little
value
for
the
latter
arouses
no
sentimentality
that
most
essential
element
of
happiness
as
aforesaid
for
every
man
who
can
not
approach
this
art
with
pure
æsthetic
enjoyment
as
friends
of
we
are
and
remain
good
friends
with
music
as
we
are
with
the
light
of
the
moon
neither
after
all
tries
to
supplant
the
sun
they
only
want
to
illumine
our
nights
to
the
best
of
their
powers
yet
we
may
jest
and
laugh
at
them
may
we
not
just
a
little
at
least
and
from
time
to
time
at
the
man
in
the
moon
at
the
woman
in
the
music
art
in
an
age
of
have
the
conscience
of
an
industrious
epoch
this
debars
us
from
devoting
our
best
hours
and
the
best
part
of
our
days
to
art
even
though
that
art
be
the
greatest
and
worthiest
art
is
for
us
a
matter
of
leisure
of
recreation
and
we
consecrate
to
it
the
of
our
time
and
strength
this
is
the
cardinal
fact
that
has
altered
the
relation
of
art
to
life
when
art
makes
its
great
demands
of
time
and
strength
upon
its
recipients
it
has
to
battle
against
the
conscience
of
the
industrious
and
efficient
it
is
relegated
to
the
idle
and
conscienceless
who
by
their
very
nature
are
not
exactly
suited
to
great
art
and
consider
its
claims
arrogant
it
might
therefore
be
all
over
with
art
since
it
lacks
air
and
the
power
to
breathe
but
perhaps
the
great
art
attempts
by
a
sort
of
coarsening
and
disguising
to
make
itself
at
home
in
that
other
atmosphere
or
at
least
to
put
up
with
atmosphere
which
is
really
a
natural
element
only
for
petty
art
the
art
of
recreation
of
pleasant
distraction
this
happens
nowadays
almost
everywhere
even
the
exponents
of
great
art
promise
recreation
and
distraction
even
they
address
themselves
to
the
exhausted
even
they
demand
from
him
the
evening
hours
of
his
like
the
artists
of
the
entertaining
school
who
are
content
to
smooth
the
furrowed
brow
and
brighten
the
eye
what
then
are
the
devices
of
their
mightier
brethren
these
have
in
their
the
most
powerful
excitants
which
might
give
a
shock
even
to
a
man
they
can
deafen
you
intoxicate
you
make
you
shudder
or
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
by
this
means
they
overpower
the
exhausted
man
and
stimulate
him
for
one
night
to
an
condition
to
an
ecstasy
of
terror
and
delight
this
great
art
as
it
now
lives
in
opera
tragedy
and
we
a
right
to
be
angry
with
it
because
of
its
perilous
fascination
as
we
should
be
angry
with
a
cunning
courtesan
certainly
not
it
would
far
rather
live
in
the
pure
element
of
morning
calm
and
would
far
rather
make
its
appeal
to
the
fresh
expectant
vigorous
of
the
beholder
or
listener
let
us
be
thankful
that
it
prefers
living
thus
to
vanishing
altogether
but
let
us
also
confess
that
an
era
that
once
more
introduces
free
and
complete
and
holidays
into
life
will
have
no
use
for
great
art
the
employees
of
science
and
the
efficient
and
successful
men
of
science
might
be
collectively
called
the
if
in
youth
their
acumen
is
sufficiently
practised
their
memory
is
full
and
hand
and
eye
have
acquired
sureness
they
are
appointed
by
an
older
to
a
scientific
position
where
their
qualities
may
prove
useful
later
on
when
they
have
themselves
gained
an
eye
for
the
gaps
and
defects
in
their
science
they
place
themselves
in
whatever
position
they
are
needed
these
persons
all
exist
for
the
sake
of
science
but
there
are
rarer
spirits
spirits
that
seldom
succeed
or
fully
for
whose
sake
science
exists
least
in
their
view
they
are
often
unpleasant
conceited
or
men
but
almost
always
prodigies
to
a
certain
extent
they
are
neither
employees
nor
employers
they
make
use
of
what
those
others
have
worked
out
and
established
with
a
certain
princely
carelessness
and
with
little
and
rare
as
if
the
others
belonged
to
a
lower
order
of
beings
yet
they
possess
the
same
qualities
as
their
and
that
sometimes
in
a
less
developed
form
moreover
they
have
a
peculiar
limitation
from
which
the
others
are
free
this
makes
it
impossible
to
put
them
into
a
place
and
to
see
in
them
useful
tools
they
can
only
live
in
their
own
air
and
on
their
own
soil
this
limitation
suggests
to
them
what
elements
of
a
science
are
theirs
other
words
what
they
can
carry
home
into
their
house
and
atmosphere
they
think
that
they
are
always
collecting
their
scattered
if
they
are
prevented
from
building
at
their
own
nest
they
perish
like
shelterless
birds
the
loss
of
freedom
causes
them
to
wilt
away
if
they
show
like
their
colleagues
a
fondness
for
certain
regions
of
science
it
is
always
only
regions
where
the
fruits
and
seeds
necessary
to
them
can
thrive
what
do
they
care
whether
science
taken
as
a
whole
has
untilled
or
badly
tilled
regions
they
lack
all
impersonal
interest
in
a
scientific
problem
as
they
are
themselves
personal
through
and
through
all
their
knowledge
and
ideas
are
remoulded
into
a
person
into
a
living
complexity
with
its
parts
interdependent
overlapping
jointly
nurtured
and
with
a
peculiar
atmosphere
and
scent
as
a
natures
with
their
system
of
personal
knowledge
produce
the
illusion
that
a
science
or
even
the
whole
of
philosophy
is
finished
and
has
reached
its
goal
the
life
in
their
system
works
this
magic
which
at
times
has
been
fatal
to
science
and
deceptive
to
the
really
efficient
workers
above
described
and
at
other
times
when
drought
and
exhaustion
prevailed
has
acted
as
a
kind
of
restorative
as
if
it
were
the
air
of

progress
in
this

and
he
knew

i
threw
him
a
look
of
reality
it
hurt
me
cruelly
we
do
the
same
in
our
recognition
of
many
of
the
talents
we
do
good
to
them
when
they
hurt
us
laughing
and

bubbling
up
in
him
a
sign
of
his
astonishment
at
the
innumerable
concealed

of
a
good

our

or
even
like
œdipus
gouge
our

our

a
bitter
violent
emotion

the
recollection
of
slanderous
and
malignant
people
through
the
denigration
of
our
future
through
the
and
acts
of
malice
which
we
mentally
direct
against
the
absent

at
times

the

can

the

that
there
is

the

assumes
the
mask
just
for
their
as
not

nay
often
from
a
feeling
of
pity

kindness
the

by

and

rather

piety
does
not
feel
content
without
a
little
dust
dirt
and
dross
the
great
danger
of
is
just
the
most
thorough
and
profound
savants
who
are
in
peril
of
seeing
their
life
s
goal
set
ever
lower
and
lower
and
with
a
feeling
of
this
in
their
minds
to
become
ever
more
discouraged
and
more
unendurable
in
the
latter
half
of
their
lives
at
first
they
plunge
into
their
science
with
spacious
hopes
and
set
themselves
daring
tasks
the
ends
of
which
are
already
anticipated
by
their
imaginations
then
there
are
moments
as
in
the
lives
of
the
great
maritime
presentiment
and
power
raise
each
other
higher
and
higher
until
a
new
shore
first
dawns
upon
the
eye
in
the
far
distance
but
now
the
stern
man
recognises
more
and
more
how
important
it
is
that
the
individual
task
of
the
inquirer
should
be
limited
as
far
as
possible
so
that
it
may
be
entirely
accomplished
and
the
intolerable
waste
of
force
from
which
earlier
periods
of
science
suffered
may
be
avoided
in
those
days
everything
was
done
ten
times
over
and
then
the
eleventh
always
had
the
last
and
best
word
yet
the
more
the
savant
learns
and
practises
this
art
of
solving
riddles
in
their
entirety
the
more
pleasure
he
finds
in
so
doing
but
at
the
same
time
his
demands
upon
what
is
here
called
entirety
grow
more
exacting
he
sets
aside
everything
that
must
remain
in
this
sense
incomplete
he
acquires
a
disgust
and
an
acute
scent
for
the
all
that
can
only
give
a
kind
of
certainty
in
a
general
and
indefinite
form
his
youthful
plans
crumble
away
before
his
eyes
there
remains
scarcely
anything
but
a
few
little
knots
in
untying
which
the
master
now
takes
his
pleasure
and
shows
his
strength
then
in
the
midst
of
all
this
useful
restless
activity
he
now
grown
old
is
suddenly
then
often
overcome
by
a
deep
misgiving
a
sort
of
torment
of
conscience
he
looks
upon
himself
as
one
changed
as
if
he
were
diminished
humbled
transformed
into
a
dexterous
he
grows
anxious
as
to
whether
mastery
in
small
matters
be
not
a
convenience
an
escape
from
the
summons
to
greatness
in
life
and
form
but
he
can
not
pass
any
time
for
that
has
gone
by
teachers
in
the
age
of
that
and
mutual
education
are
becoming
more
widespread
the
teacher
in
his
usual
form
must
become
almost
unnecessary
friends
eager
to
learn
who
wish
to
master
some
branch
of
knowledge
together
find
in
our
age
of
books
a
shorter
and
more
natural
way
than
school
and
vanity
as
the
greatest
the
strong
individual
uses
not
only
nature
but
even
societies
and
weaker
individuals
as
objects
of
rapine
he
exploits
them
so
far
as
he
can
and
then
passes
on
as
he
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
alternating
between
hunger
and
superfluity
he
kills
more
animals
than
he
can
eat
and
robs
and
maltreats
men
more
than
is
necessary
his
manifestation
of
power
is
at
the
same
time
one
of
revenge
against
his
cramped
and
worried
existence
furthermore
he
wishes
to
be
held
more
powerful
than
he
is
and
thus
misuses
opportunities
the
accretion
of
fear
that
he
begets
being
an
accretion
of
power
he
soon
observes
that
he
stands
or
falls
not
by
what
he
but
by
what
he
is
to
be
herein
lies
the
origin
of
vanity
the
man
of
power
seeks
by
every
means
to
increase
others
faith
in
his
thralls
who
tremble
before
him
and
serve
him
know
for
their
part
that
they
are
worth
just
so
much
as
they
appear
to
him
to
be
worth
and
so
they
work
with
an
eye
to
this
valuation
rather
than
to
their
own
we
know
vanity
only
in
its
most
weakened
forms
in
its
idealisations
and
its
small
doses
because
we
live
in
a
late
and
very
emasculated
state
of
society
originally
vanity
is
the
great
utility
the
strongest
means
of
preservation
and
indeed
vanity
will
be
greater
the
cleverer
the
individual
because
an
increase
in
the
belief
in
power
is
easier
than
an
increase
in
the
power
itself
but
only
for
him
who
has
intellect
or
as
must
be
the
case
under
primitive
conditions
who
is
cunning
and
crafty
of
are
so
few
decisive
of
culture
that
we
must
be
glad
to
have
at
least
one
unfailing
sign
at
hand
for
use
in
house
and
garden
to
test
whether
a
man
belongs
to
us
i
mean
to
the
free
spirits
or
not
we
must
test
his
sentiments
regarding
christianity
if
he
looks
upon
christianity
with
other
than
a
critical
eye
we
turn
our
backs
to
him
for
he
brings
us
impure
air
and
bad
is
no
longer
our
task
to
teach
such
men
what
a
sirocco
wind
is
they
have
moses
and
the
prophets
of
weather
and
of
enlightenment
if
they
will
not
listen
to
these
there
is
a
proper
time
for
wrath
and
and
punishment
are
our
inheritance
from
the
animals
man
does
not
become
of
age
until
he
has
restored
to
the
animals
this
gift
of
the
lies
buried
one
of
the
mightiest
ideas
that
men
can
have
the
idea
of
a
progress
of
all
us
go
forward
together
a
few
millenniums
my
friends
there
is
still
reserved
for
mankind
a
great
deal
of
joy
the
very
scent
of
which
has
not
yet
been
wafted
to
the
men
of
our
day
indeed
we
may
promise
ourselves
this
joy
nay
summon
and
conjure
it
up
as
a
necessary
thing
so
long
as
the
development
of
human
reason
does
not
stand
still
some
day
we
shall
no
longer
be
reconciled
to
the
logical
sin
that
lurks
in
all
wrath
and
punishment
whether
exercised
by
the
individual
or
by
day
when
head
and
heart
have
learnt
to
live
as
near
together
as
they
now
are
far
apart
that
they
no
longer
stand
so
far
apart
as
they
did
originally
is
fairly
palpable
from
a
glance
at
the
whole
course
of
humanity
the
individual
who
can
review
a
life
of
introspective
work
will
become
conscious
of
the
arrived
at
with
a
proud
delight
at
the
distance
he
has
bridged
in
order
that
he
may
thereupon
venture
upon
more
ample
hopes
origin
of
snack
of
good
food
often
decides
whether
we
are
to
look
to
the
future
with
hollow
eye
or
in
hopeful
mood
the
same
influence
extends
to
the
very
highest
and
most
intellectual
states
discontent
and
reviling
of
the
world
are
for
the
present
generation
an
inheritance
from
starveling
ancestors
even
in
our
artists
and
poets
we
often
notice
that
however
exuberant
their
life
they
are
not
of
good
birth
and
have
often
from
oppressed
and
ancestors
inherited
in
their
blood
and
brain
much
that
comes
out
as
the
subject
and
even
the
conscious
colouring
of
their
work
the
culture
of
the
greeks
is
a
culture
of
men
of
wealth
in
fact
inherited
wealth
for
a
few
centuries
they
lived
better
than
we
do
better
in
every
sense
in
particular
far
more
simply
in
food
and
drink
then
the
brain
finally
became
so
and
subtle
and
the
blood
flowed
so
quickly
like
a
joyous
clear
wine
that
the
best
in
them
came
to
light
no
longer
as
gloomy
distorted
and
violent
but
full
of
beauty
and
sunshine
of
reasonable
is
more
reasonable
to
stop
the
machine
when
the
works
have
done
the
task
demanded
of
them
or
to
let
it
run
on
until
it
stands
still
of
its
own
other
words
is
destroyed
is
not
the
latter
a
waste
of
the
cost
of
upkeep
a
misuse
of
the
strength
and
care
of
those
who
serve
are
men
not
here
throwing
away
that
which
would
be
sorely
needed
elsewhere
is
not
a
kind
of
contempt
of
the
machines
propagated
in
that
many
of
them
are
so
uselessly
tended
and
kept
up
am
speaking
of
involuntary
natural
and
voluntary
reasonable
death
natural
death
is
independent
of
all
reason
and
is
really
an
irrational
death
in
which
the
pitiable
substance
of
the
shell
determines
how
long
the
kernel
is
to
exist
or
not
in
which
accordingly
the
stunted
diseased
and
jailer
is
lord
and
indicates
the
moment
at
which
his
distinguished
prisoner
shall
die
natural
death
is
the
suicide
of
other
words
the
annihilation
of
the
most
rational
being
through
the
most
irrational
element
that
is
attached
thereto
only
through
religious
illumination
can
the
reverse
appear
for
then
as
is
equitable
the
higher
reason
god
issues
its
orders
which
the
lower
reason
has
to
obey
outside
religious
thought
natural
death
is
not
worth
glorifying
the
wise
dispensation
and
disposal
of
death
belongs
to
that
now
quite
incomprehensible
and
morality
of
the
future
the
dawn
of
which
it
will
be
an
ineffable
delight
to
behold
retrograde
criminals
force
society
back
to
earlier
stages
of
culture
than
that
in
which
they
are
placed
for
the
time
being
their
influence
is
retrograde
let
us
consider
the
tools
that
society
must
forge
and
maintain
for
its
defence
the
cunning
detectives
the
jailers
the
hangmen
nor
should
we
forget
the
public
counsel
for
prosecution
and
defence
finally
we
may
ask
ourselves
whether
the
judge
himself
and
punishment
and
the
whole
legal
procedure
are
not
oppressive
rather
than
elevating
in
their
reaction
upon
all
who
are
not
for
we
shall
never
succeed
in
arraying
and
revenge
in
the
garb
of
innocence
and
so
long
as
men
are
used
and
sacrificed
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
society
all
loftier
humanity
will
deplore
this
necessity
war
as
a
nations
that
are
growing
weak
and
contemptible
war
may
be
prescribed
as
a
remedy
if
indeed
they
really
want
to
go
on
living
national
consumption
as
well
as
individual
admits
of
a
brutal
cure
the
eternal
will
to
live
and
inability
to
die
is
however
in
itself
already
a
sign
of
senility
of
emotion
the
more
fully
and
thoroughly
we
live
the
more
ready
we
are
to
sacrifice
life
for
a
single
pleasurable
emotion
a
people
that
lives
and
feels
in
this
wise
has
no
need
of
war
intellectual
and
physical
transplantation
as
different
cultures
are
so
many
intellectual
climates
every
one
of
which
is
peculiarly
harmful
or
beneficial
to
this
or
that
organism
history
as
a
whole
as
the
knowledge
of
different
cultures
is
the
science
of
remedies
but
not
the
science
of
the
healing
art
itself
we
still
need
a
physician
who
can
make
use
of
these
remedies
in
order
to
send
every
or
the
climate
that
just
suits
him
to
live
in
the
present
within
the
limits
of
a
single
culture
is
insufficient
as
a
universal
remedy
too
many
highly
useful
kinds
of
men
who
can
not
breathe
freely
in
this
atmosphere
would
perish
with
the
aid
of
history
we
must
give
them
air
and
try
to
preserve
them
even
men
of
lower
cultures
have
their
to
this
cure
of
intellects
that
humanity
on
considerations
of
bodily
health
must
strive
to
discover
by
means
of
a
medical
geography
what
kinds
of
degeneration
and
disease
are
caused
by
each
region
of
the
earth
and
conversely
what
ingredients
of
health
the
earth
affords
and
then
gradually
nations
families
and
individuals
must
be
transplanted
long
and
permanently
enough
for
them
to
become
masters
of
their
inherited
physical
infirmities
the
whole
world
will
finally
be
a
series
of
sanatoria
reason
and
the
tree
of
you
all
fear
in
your
senile
regarding
the
of
the
world
gives
the
more
hopeful
a
mighty
task
man
is
some
day
to
become
a
tree
overshadowing
the
whole
earth
with
millions
upon
millions
of
buds
that
shall
all
grow
to
fruits
side
by
side
and
the
earth
itself
shall
be
prepared
for
the
nourishment
of
this
tree
that
the
shoot
tiny
as
yet
may
increase
in
sap
and
strength
that
the
sap
may
flow
in
countless
channels
for
the
nutrition
of
the
whole
and
the
these
and
similar
tasks
we
must
derive
our
standard
for
measuring
whether
a
man
of
is
useful
or
worthless
the
task
is
unspeakably
great
and
adventurous
let
us
all
contribute
our
share
to
prevent
the
tree
from
rotting
before
its
time
the
historically
trained
mind
will
no
doubt
succeed
in
calling
up
the
human
activities
of
all
the
ages
before
its
eyes
as
the
community
of
ants
with
its
cunningly
wrought
mounds
stands
before
our
eyes
superficially
judged
mankind
as
a
whole
like
might
admit
of
our
speaking
of
on
a
closer
examination
we
observe
how
whole
nations
nay
whole
centuries
take
pains
to
discover
and
test
new
means
of
benefiting
the
great
mass
of
humanity
and
thus
finally
the
great
common
of
the
world
whatever
injury
the
individual
nations
or
periods
may
suffer
in
this
testing
process
they
have
each
become
wise
through
this
injury
and
from
them
the
tide
of
wisdom
slowly
pours
over
the
principles
of
whole
races
and
whole
epochs
ants
too
go
astray
and
make
blunders
through
the
folly
of
its
remedies
mankind
may
well
go
to
rack
and
ruin
before
the
proper
time
there
is
no
sure
guiding
instinct
for
the
former
or
the
latter
rather
must
we
boldly
face
the
great
task
of
preparing
the
earth
for
a
plant
of
the
most
ample
and
joyous
task
set
by
reason
to
reason
the
praise
of
disinterestedness
and
its
two
neighbouring
chieftains
there
was
a
quarrel
they
laid
waste
each
other
s
territories
stole
cattle
and
burnt
down
houses
with
an
indecisive
result
on
the
whole
because
their
power
was
fairly
equal
a
third
who
from
the
distant
situation
of
his
property
was
able
to
keep
aloof
from
these
feuds
yet
had
reason
to
dread
the
day
when
one
of
the
two
neighbours
should
gain
a
decisive
preponderance
at
last
intervened
between
the
combatants
with
ceremonial
goodwill
secretly
he
lent
a
heavy
weight
to
his
peace
proposal
by
giving
either
to
understand
that
he
would
henceforth
join
forces
with
the
other
against
the
one
who
strove
to
break
the
peace
they
met
in
his
presence
they
hesitatingly
placed
into
his
hand
the
hands
that
had
hitherto
been
the
tools
and
only
too
often
the
causes
of
then
they
really
and
seriously
tried
to
keep
the
peace
either
saw
with
astonishment
how
suddenly
his
prosperity
and
his
comfort
increased
how
he
now
had
as
neighbour
a
dealer
ready
to
buy
and
sell
instead
of
a
treacherous
or
openly
scornful
how
even
in
unforeseen
troubles
they
could
reciprocally
save
each
other
from
distress
instead
of
as
before
making
capital
out
of
this
distress
of
his
neighbour
and
enhancing
it
to
the
highest
degree
it
even
seemed
as
if
the
human
type
had
improved
in
both
countries
for
the
eyes
had
become
brighter
the
forehead
had
lost
its
wrinkles
all
now
felt
confidence
in
the
nothing
is
more
advantageous
for
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
than
this
confidence
they
saw
each
other
every
year
on
the
anniversary
of
the
alliance
the
chieftains
as
well
as
their
retinue
and
indeed
before
the
eyes
of
the
mediator
whose
mode
of
action
they
admired
and
revered
more
and
more
the
greater
the
profit
that
they
owed
to
him
became
then
his
mode
of
action
was
called
they
had
looked
far
too
fixedly
at
the
profit
they
had
reaped
themselves
hitherto
to
see
anything
more
of
their
neighbour
s
method
of
dealing
than
that
his
condition
in
consequence
of
this
had
not
altered
so
much
as
their
own
he
had
rather
remained
the
same
and
thus
it
appeared
that
the
former
had
not
had
his
profit
in
view
for
the
first
time
people
said
to
themselves
that
disinterestedness
was
a
virtue
it
is
true
that
in
minor
private
matters
similar
circumstances
had
arisen
but
men
only
had
eyes
for
this
virtue
when
it
was
depicted
on
the
walls
in
a
large
script
that
was
legible
to
the
whole
community
moral
qualities
are
not
recognised
as
virtues
endowed
with
names
held
in
esteem
and
recommended
as
worthy
of
acquisition
until
the
moment
when
they
have
decided
the
happiness
and
destiny
of
whole
societies
for
then
the
loftiness
of
sentiment
and
the
excitation
of
the
inner
creative
forces
is
in
many
so
great
that
offerings
are
brought
to
this
quality
offerings
from
the
best
of
what
each
possesses
at
its
feet
the
serious
man
lays
his
seriousness
the
dignified
man
his
dignity
women
their
gentleness
the
young
all
the
wealth
of
hope
and
futurity
that
in
them
lies
the
poet
lends
it
words
and
names
sets
it
marching
in
the
procession
of
similar
beings
gives
it
a
pedigree
and
finally
as
is
the
way
of
artists
adores
the
picture
of
his
fancy
as
a
new
even
teaches
others
to
adore
thus
in
the
end
with
the
of
universal
love
and
gratitude
a
virtue
becomes
like
a
statue
a
repository
of
all
that
is
good
and
honourable
a
sort
of
temple
and
divine
personage
combined
it
appears
thenceforward
as
an
individual
virtue
as
an
absolute
entity
which
it
was
not
before
and
exercises
the
power
and
privileges
of
a
sanctified
the
later
days
of
greece
the
cities
were
full
of
such
deified
human
abstractions
if
one
may
so
call
them
the
nation
in
its
own
fashion
had
set
up
a
platonic
heaven
of
ideas
on
earth
and
i
do
not
think
that
its
inhabitants
were
felt
to
be
less
alive
than
any
of
the
old
homeric
divinities
days
of
days
of
darkness
is
the
name
given
in
norway
to
the
period
when
the
sun
remains
below
the
horizon
the
whole
day
long
the
temperature
then
falls
slowly
but
fine
simile
for
all
thinkers
for
whom
the
sun
of
the
human
future
is
temporarily
eclipsed
the
philosophy
of

figs
a

and

or
four

the
luxury
of
epicurus
the
epochs
of
real

of

those
brief
periods
of
cessation
midway
between
the
rise
and
decline
of

emotion

a
bungled
piece
of
symbolic
concatenations
of
scenes
and
images
in
place
of
a
narrative
poetical
language
they
paraphrase
our
experiences
or
expectations
or
relations
with
poetic
boldness
and
definiteness
so
that
in
the
morning
we
are
always
astonished
at
ourselves
when
we
remember
the
nature
of
our
dream
in
dreams
we
use
up
too
much
hence
are
often
too
poor
in
artistry
in
the
daytime
nature
and
in
nature
so
in
science
the
worse
and
less
fertile
soils
are
first
the
means
that
science
in
its
early
stages
has
at
command
are
fairly
sufficient
for
this
purpose
the
working
of
the
most
fertile
soils
requires
an
enormous
carefully
developed
persevering
method
tangible
individual
results
and
an
organised
body
of
workers
all
these
are
found
together
only
at
a
late
and
ambition
often
grasp
too
early
at
these
most
fertile
soils
but
the
results
are
then
from
the
first
null
and
void
in
nature
such
losses
would
usually
be
avenged
by
the
starvation
of
the
settlers
the
simple
simple
mode
of
life
is
nowadays
difficult
requiring
as
it
does
far
more
reflection
and
gift
for
invention
than
even
very
clever
people
possess
the
most
honourable
will
perhaps
still
say
i
have
not
the
time
for
such
lengthy
reflection
the
simple
life
is
for
me
too
lofty
a
goal
i
will
wait
till
those
wiser
than
i
have
discovered
peaks
and
poor
fertility
the
frequent
celibacy
and
in
general
the
sexual
coldness
of
the
highest
and
most
cultivated

intelligence
recognises
and
makes
use
of
the
fact
that
at
an
acme
of
intellectual

the

of

a
close

will
reveal
the
dovetails
where
the
new
building
grows
out
of
the
old
this
is
the
biographer
s
task
he
must
reflect
upon
his
subject
on
the
principle
that
nature
takes
no
jumps
clean
who
clothes
himself
with
rags
washed
clean
dresses
cleanly
to
be
sure
but
is
still
ragged
the
solitary
compensation
for
much
disgust
disheartenment
as
a
lonely
life
without
friends
books
duties
and
passions
must
enjoy
those
short
spans
of
deep
communion
with
ourselves
and
with

he
who
fortifies
himself
completely
against
boredom
fortifies
himself
against
himself
too
he
will
never
drink
the
most
powerful
elixir
from
his
own
innermost
spring
false
hate
those
natural
beauties
which
really
have
significance
only
through
science
especially
geographical
science
but
are
insignificant
in
an
æsthetic
sense
for
example
the
view
of
mont
blanc
from
geneva
this
is
an
insignificant
thing
without
the
auxiliary
mental
joy
of
science
the
nearer
mountains
are
all
more
beautiful
and
fuller
of
expression
but
not
nearly
so
high
adds
that
absurd
depreciatory
science
the
eye
here
contradicts
science
how
can
it
truly
rejoice
in
the
contradiction
those
that
travel
for
animals
stupid
and
perspiring
they
climb
mountains
people
forgot
to
tell
them
that
there
were
fine
views
on
the
way
too
much
and
too
nowadays
live
too
much
and
think
too
little
they
have
hunger
and
dyspepsia
together
and
become
thinner
and
thinner
however
much
they
eat
he
who
now
says
nothing
has
happened
to
me
is
a
blockhead
end
and
every
end
is
the
goal
the
end
of
a
melody
is
not
its
goal
and
yet
if
a
melody
has
not
reached
its
end
it
has
also
not
reached
its
goal
a
parable
neutrality
of
nature
on
a
grand
neutrality
of
nature
on
a
grand
scale
in
mountain
sea
forest
and
desert
is
pleasing
but
only
for
a
brief
space
afterwards
we
become
impatient
have
they
all
nothing
to
say
to
do
not
exist
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
there
arises
a
feeling
that
a
is
committed
against
humanity
forgetting
our
a
journey
we
commonly
forget
its
goal
almost
every
vocation
is
chosen
and
entered
upon
as
means
to
an
end
but
is
continued
as
the
ultimate
end
forgetting
our
purpose
is
the
most
frequent
form
of
folly
solar
orbit
of
an
an
idea
is
just
rising
on
the
horizon
the
soul
s
temperature
is
usually
very
low
gradually
the
idea
develops
in
warmth
and
is
hottest
that
is
to
say
exerts
its
greatest
influence
when
belief
in
the
idea
is
already
on
the
wane
how
to
have
every
man
against
some
one
now
dared
to
say
he
that
is
not
for
me
is
against
me
he
would
at
once
have
all
against
sentiment
does
credit
to
our
era
being
ashamed
of
age
endures
only
a
single
species
of
rich
who
are
ashamed
of
their
wealth
if
we
hear
it
said
of
any
one
that
he
is
very
rich
we
at
once
feel
a
similar
sentiment
to
that
experienced
at
the
sight
of
a
repulsively
swollen
invalid
one
suffering
from
diabetes
or
dropsy
we
must
with
an
effort
remember
our
humanity
in
order
to
go
about
with
this
rich
man
in
such
a
way
that
he
does
not
notice
our
feeling
of
disgust
but
as
soon
as
he
prides
himself
at
all
on
his
wealth
our
feelings
are
mingled
with
an
almost
compassionate
surprise
at
such
a
high
degree
of
human
unreason
we
would
fain
raise
our
hands
to
heaven
and
cry
poor
deformed
and
overburdened
creature
fettered
a
hundredfold
to
whom
every
hour
brings
or
may
bring
something
unpleasant
in
whose
frame
twitches
every
event
that
occurs
in
scores
of
countries
how
can
you
make
us
believe
that
you
feel
at
ease
in
your
position
if
you
appear
anywhere
in
public
we
know
that
it
is
a
sort
of
running
the
gauntlet
amid
countless
glances
that
have
for
you
only
cold
hate
or
importunity
or
silent
scorn
you
may
earn
more
easily
than
others
but
it
is
only
a
superfluous
earning
which
brings
little
joy
and
the
guarding
of
what
you
have
earned
is
now
at
any
rate
a
more
troublesome
business
than
any
toilsome
process
of
earning
you
are
continually
suffering
because
you
are
continually
losing
what
avails
it
you
that
they
are
always
injecting
you
with
fresh
artificial
blood
that
does
not
relieve
the
pain
of
those
that
are
fixed
for
ever
fixed
on
your
neck
to
be
quite
fair
to
you
it
is
difficult
or
perhaps
impossible
for
you
to
be
rich
you
guard
you
earn
more
the
inherited
bent
of
your
character
is
the
yoke
fastened
upon
you
but
do
not
on
that
account
deceive
honestly
and
visibly
ashamed
of
the
yoke
you
wear
as
in
your
soul
you
are
weary
and
unwilling
to
wear
it
this
shame
is
no
extravagant
are
men
so
presumptuous
that
they
can
only
praise
a
greatness
which
they
publicly
admire
by
representing
it
as
steps
and
bridges
that
lead
to
themselves
on
the
soil
of
who
wishes
to
deprive
men
of
a
conception
is
generally
not
satisfied
with
refuting
it
and
drawing
out
of
it
the
illogical
worm
that
resides
within
rather
when
the
worm
has
been
killed
does
he
throw
the
whole
fruit
as
well
into
the
mire
in
order
to
make
it
ignoble
in
men
s
sight
and
to
inspire
disgust
thus
he
thinks
that
he
has
found
a
means
of
making
the
usual
resurrection
of
conceptions
an
is
wrong
for
on
the
very
soil
of
insult
in
the
midst
of
the
filth
the
kernel
of
the
conception
soon
produces
new
right
thing
then
is
not
to
scorn
and
bespatter
what
one
wishes
finally
to
remove
but
to
lay
it
tenderly
on
ice
again
and
again
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
conceptions
are
very
tenacious
of
life
here
we
must
act
according
to
the
maxim
one
refutation
is
no
the
lot
of
spiritual
bondage
is
being
relaxed
morality
the
inherited
traditional
instinctive
mode
of
action
in

with
moral
sentiments
is
surely
also
on

yes
distrust
as
it
never

distrust
of
anything
and

this
is
the

road
to
truth
the

must
not

have
to
swallow

of

so
as
not
to
die

although
you
know
that
they
are
lies
but
those

perhaps

the
spirit
of
the
last
centuries
before

more
come
into

and
they
collectively
form
an
important
link
in
the
great
and
still
continuous
chain
of
the
renaissance
their
books
are
raised
above
all
changes
of
national
taste
and
philosophical
nuances
from
which
as
a
rule
every
book
takes
and
must
take
its
hue

order
to
become

they
contain
more
real
ideas
than
all

books
of

together
ideas
of
the
sort
that
breed
am
at
a
loss
how
to
define
to
the
end
enough
to
say
that
they
appear
to
me
writers
who
wrote
neither
for
children
nor
for
visionaries
neither
for
virgins
nor
for
christians
neither
for
germans
nor
am
again
at
a
loss
how
to
finish
my
list
to
praise
them
in
plain
terms
i
may
say
that
had
they
been
written
in
greek
they
would
have
been
understood
by
greeks
how
much
on
the
other
hand
would
even
a
plato
have
understood
of
the
writings
of
our
best
german
and
schopenhauer
for
say
nothing
of
the
repugnance
that
he
would
have
felt
to
their
style
particularly
to
its
obscure
exaggerated
and
occasionally
elements
and
these
are
defects
from
which
these
two
among
german
thinkers
suffer
least
and
yet
far
too
much
goethe
as
thinker
was
fonder
than
he
should
have
been
of
embracing
the
cloud
and
schopenhauer
almost
constantly
wanders
not
with
impunity
among
symbols
of
objects
rather
than
among
the
objects
themselves
the
other
hand
what
clearness
and
graceful
precision
there
is
in
these
frenchmen
the
greeks
whose
ears
were
most
refined
could
not
but
have
approved
of
this
art
and
one
quality
they
would
even
have
admired
and
french
verbal
wit
they
were
extremely
fond
of
this
quality
without
being
particularly
strong
in
it

and
ignorance
uncleanness
and
superstition
are
still
rife

is
backward

on

where
the
opposite

fashion
is
accordingly
to
be
found
next
to
the
virtues

modern
europe
are
we
to
call
it
their
seamy
side
dress
that
is
fashionable
and
no
longer
national
proclaims
of
its
wearer
firstly
that
he
does
not
wish
to
appear
as
an
individual
or
as
member
of
a
class
or
race
that
he
has
made
an
intentional
suppression
of
these
kinds
of
vanity
a
law
unto
himself
secondly
that
he
is
a
worker
and
has
little
time
for
dressing
and
and
moreover
regards
anything
expensive
or
luxurious
in
material
and
cut
as
out
of
harmony
with
his
work
lastly
that
by
his
clothes
he
indicates
the
more
learned
and
intellectual
callings
as
those
to
which
he
stands
or
would
like
to
stand
nearest
as
a
such
national
costumes
as
still
exist
would
exhibit
the
occupations
of
brigand
shepherd
and
soldier
as
the
most
desirable
and
distinguished
within
this
general
character
of
masculine
fashion
exist
the
slight
fluctuations
demanded
by
the
vanity
of
young
men
the
dandies
and
dawdlers
of
our
great
other
words
europeans
who
have
not
yet
reached
women
are
as
yet
far
less
mature
and
for
this
reason
the
fluctuations
with
them
are
much
greater
they
also
will
not
have
the
national
costume
and
hate
to
be
recognised
by
their
dress
as
german
french
or
russian
they
are
however
very
desirous
of
creating
an
impression
as
individuals
then
too
their
dress
must
leave
no
one
in
doubt
that
they
belong
to
one
of
the
more
reputable
classes
of
society
to
good
or
high
or
great
society
and
on
this
score
their
pretensions
are
all
the
greater
if
they
belong
scarcely
or
not
at
all
to
that
class
above
all
the
young
woman
does
not
want
to
wear
what
an
older
woman
wears
because
she
thinks
she
loses
her
market
value
if
she
is
suspected
of
being
somewhat
advanced
in
years
the
older
woman
on
the
other
hand
would
like
to
deceive
the
world
as
long
as
possible
by
a
youthful
garb
from
this
competition
must
continually
arise
temporary
fashions
in
which
the
youthful
element
is
unmistakably
and
inimitably
apparent
but
after
the
inventive
genius
of
the
young
female
artists
has
run
riot
for
some
time
in
such
indiscreet
revelations
of
youth
or
rather
after
the
inventive
genius
of
older
courtly
civilisations
and
of
still
existing
fact
of
the
whole
world
of
been
pressed
into
the
service
and
say
the
spaniards
turks
and
ancient
greeks
have
been
yoked
together
for
the
glorification
of
fair
flesh
then
they
at
last
discover
time
and
again
that
they
have
not
been
good
judges
of
their
own
interest
that
if
they
wish
to
have
power
over
men
the
game
of
with
the
beautiful
body
is
more
likely
to
win
than
naked
or
honesty
and
then
the
wheel
of
taste
and
vanity
turns
once
more
in
an
opposite
direction
the
rather
older
young
women
find
that
their
kingdom
has
come
and
the
competition
of
the
dear
absurd
creatures
rages
again
from
the
the
more
women
advance
mentally
and
no
longer
among
themselves
concede
the
to
an
unripe
age
the
smaller
their
fluctuations
of
costume
grow
and
the
less
elaborate
their
adornment
a
just
verdict
in
this
respect
must
not
be
based
on
ancient
other
words
not
on
the
standard
of
the
dress
of
women
who
dwell
on
the
shores
of
the
must
have
an
eye
to
the
climatic
conditions
of
the
central
and
northern
regions
where
the
intellectual
and
creative
spirit
of
europe
now
finds
its
most
natural
speaking
therefore
it
is
not
change
that
will
be
the
characteristic
mark
of
fashion
and
modernity
for
change
is
retrograde
and
betokens
the
still
unripened
men
and
women
of
europe
but
rather
the
repudiation
of
national
social
and
individual
vanity
accordingly
it
is
commendable
because
involving
a
saving
of
time
and
strength
if
certain
cities
and
districts
of
europe
think
and
invent
for
all
the
rest
in
the
matter
of
dress
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
sense
of
form
does
not
seem
to
have
been
bestowed
upon
all
nor
is
it
really
an
excessive
ambition
so
long
as
these
fluctuations
still
exist
for
paris
for
example
to
claim
to
be
the
sole
inventor
and
innovator
in
this
sphere
if
a
german
from
hatred
of
these
claims
on
the
part
of
a
french
city
wishes
to
dress
differently
for
example
in
the
dürer
style
him
reflect
that
he
then
has
a
costume
which
the
germans
of
olden
times
wore
but
which
the
germans
have
not
in
the
slightest
degree
invented
for
there
has
never
been
a
style
of
dress
that
characterised
the
german
as
a
german
moreover
let
him
observe
how
he
looks
in
his
costume
and
whether
his
altogether
modern
face
with
all
its
hues
and
wrinkles
does
not
raise
a
protest
against
a
dürer
fashion
of
where
the
concepts
modern
and
european
are
almost
identical
we
understand
by
europe
a
far
wider
region
than
is
embraced
by
the
europe
of
geography
the
little
peninsula
of
asia
in
particular
we
must
include
america
in
so
far
as
america
is
the
daughter
of
our
civilisation
on
the
other
hand
not
all
europe
falls
under
the
heading
of
cultured

but
only
those
nations
and
divisions
of
nations
which
have
their
common
past
in
greece
rome
judaism
and
christianity
german
is
no
denying
that
from
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
current
of
moral
awakening
flowed
through
europe
then
only
virtue
found
again
the
power
of
speech
she
learnt
to
discover
the
unrestrained
gestures
of
exaltation
and
emotion
she
was
no
longer
ashamed
of
herself
and
she
created
philosophies
and
poems
for
her
own
glorification
if
we
look
for
the
sources
of
this
current
we
come
upon
rousseau
but
the
mythical
rousseau
the
phantom
formed
from
the
impression
left
by
his
writings
one
might
almost
say
again
his
mythically
interpreted
writings
and
by
the
indications
that
he
provided
himself
he
and
his
public
constantly
worked
at
the
fashioning
of
this
ideal
figure
the
other
origin
lies
in
the
resurrection
of
the
stoical
side
of
rome
s
greatness
whereby
the
french
so
nobly
carried
on
the
task
of
the
renaissance
with
striking
success
they
proceeded
from
the
reproduction
of
antique
forms
to
the
reproduction
of
antique
characters
thus
they
may
always
claim
a
title
to
the
highest
honours
as
the
nation
which
has
hitherto
given
the
modern
world
its
best
books
and
its
best
men
how
this
twofold
archetype
the
mythical
rousseau
and
the
resurrected
spirit
of
rome
affected
france
s
weaker
neighbours
is
particularly
noticeable
in
germany
which
in
consequence
of
her
novel
and
quite
unwonted
impulse
to
seriousness
and
loftiness
in
will
and
finally
came
to
feel
astonishment
at
her
own
newfound
virtue
and
launched
into
the
world
the
concept
german
virtue
as
if
this
were
the
most
original
and
hereditary
of
her
possessions
the
first
great
men
who
transfused
into
their
own
blood
that
french
impulse
towards
greatness
and
consciousness
of
the
moral
will
were
more
honest
and
more
grateful
whence
comes
the
moralism
of
kant
he
is
continually
reminding
us
from
rousseau
and
the
revival
of
stoic
rome
the
moralism
of
schiller
has
the
same
source
and
the
same
glorification
of
the
source
the
moralism
of
beethoven
in
notes
is
a
continual
song
in
praise
of
rousseau
the
antique
french
and
schiller
young
germany
was
the
first
to
forget
its
gratitude
because
in
the
meantime
people
had
listened
to
the
preachers
of
hatred
of
the
french
the
young
german
came
to
the
fore
with
more
consciousness
than
is
generally
allowed
to
youths
when
he
investigated
his
paternity
he
might
well
think
of
the
proximity
of
schiller
schleiermacher
and
fichte
but
he
should
have
looked
for
his
grandfathers
in
paris
and
geneva
and
it
was
very
of
him
to
believe
what
he
believed
that
virtue
was
not
more
than
thirty
years
old
people
became
used
to
demanding
that
the
word
german
should
connote
virtue
and
this
process
has
not
been
wholly
forgotten
to
this
it
observed
further
that
this
moral
awakening
as
may
almost
be
guessed
has
resulted
only
in
drawbacks
and
obstacles
to
the
of
moral
phenomena
what
is
the
entire
german
philosophy
starting
from
kant
with
all
its
french
english
and
italian
offshoots
and
a
attack
upon
helvetius
a
rejection
of
the
slowly
and
laboriously
acquired
views
and
signposts
of
the
right
road
which
in
the
end
he
collected
and
expressed
so
well
to
this
day
helvetius
is
the
of
all
good
moralists
and
good
men
in
germany
classic
and
classically
and
romantically
minded
species
that
always
a
vision
of
the
future
but
the
former
derive
their
vision
from
the
strength
of
their
time
the
latter
from
its
weakness
the
machine
as
teaches
in
itself
the
dovetailed
working
of
masses
of
men
in
activities
where
each
has
but
one
thing
to
do
it
is
the
model
of
party
organisations
and
of
warfare
on
the
other
hand
it
does
not
teach
individual
for
it
makes
of
the
many
a
machine
and
of
each
individual
a
tool
for
one
purpose
its
most
general
effect
is
to
teach
the
advantage
of
centralisation
unable
to
likes
to
live
in
a
small
town
but
from
time
to
time
just
this
small
town
drives
us
out
into
bare
and
lonely
nature
especially
when
we
think
we
know
it
too
well
finally
in
order
to
refresh
ourselves
from
nature
we
go
to
the
big
town
a
few
draughts
from
this
cup
and
we
see
its
dregs
and
the
circle
begins
afresh
with
the
small
town
as
the
moderns
live
they
are
in
all
things
rather
too
thorough
to
be
able
to
settle
like
the
men
of
other
days
reaction
against
the
civilisation
of
machine
itself
a
product
of
the
highest
mental
powers
sets
in
motion
hardly
any
but
the
lower
unthinking
forces
of
the
men
who
serve
it
true
it
unfetters
a
vast
quantity
of
force
which
would
otherwise
lie
dormant
but
it
does
not
communicate
the
impulse
to
climb
higher
to
improve
to
become
artistic
it
creates
activity
and
monotony
but
this
in
the
produces
a
a
despairing
ennui
of
the
soul
which
through
machinery
has
learnt
to
hanker
after
the
variety
of
leisure
the
danger
of
the
theatrical
bestially
cruel
licentious
and
especially
sentimental
and
elements
which
go
to
form
the
true
revolutionary
substance
and
became
flesh
and
spirit
before
the
revolution
in
this
composite
being
with
factitious
enthusiasm
finally
set
even
enlightenment
upon
its
fanatical
head
which
thereby
began
itself
to
shine
as
in
an
illuminating
halo
yet
enlightenment
is
essentially
foreign
to
that
phenomenon
and
if
left
to
itself
would
have
pierced
silently
through
the
clouds
like
a
shaft
of
light
long
content
to
transfigure
individuals
alone
and
thus
only
slowly
transfiguring
national
customs
and
institutions
as
well
but
now
bound
hand
and
foot
to
a
violent
and
abrupt
monster
enlightenment
itself
became
violent
and
abrupt
its
danger
has
therefore
become
almost
greater
than
its
useful
quality
of
liberation
and
illumination
which
it
introduced
into
the
great
revolutionary
movement
whoever
grasps
this
will
also
know
from
what
confusion
it
has
to
be
extricated
from
what
impurities
to
be
cleansed
in
order
that
it
may
then
by
itself
continue
the
work
of
enlightenment
and
also
nip
the
revolution
in
the
bud
and
nullify
its
effects
passion
in
the
middle
middle
ages
are
the
period
of
great
passions
neither
antiquity
nor
our
period
possesses
this
widening
of
the
soul
never
was
the
capacity
of
the
soul
greater
or
measured
by
larger
standards
the
physical
primeval
sensuality
of
the
barbarian
races
and
the
eyes
of
christian
mystics
the
most
childish
and
youthful
and
the
most
and
the
savageness
of
the
beast
of
prey
and
the
effeminacy
and
excessive
refinement
of
the
late
antique
these
elements
were
then
not
seldom
united
in
one
and
the
same
person
thus
if
a
man
was
seized
by
a
passion
the
rapidity
of
the
torrent
must
have
been
greater
the
whirl
more
confused
the
fall
deeper
than
ever
modern
men
may
be
content
to
feel
that
we
have
suffered
a
loss
here
robbing
and
intellectual
movements
whereby
the
great
may
hope
to
rob
and
the
small
to
save
are
sure
to
prosper
that
is
why
for
instance
the
german
reformation
made
progress
gladsome
even
a
remote
hint
of
drink
drunkenness
and
an
kind
of
jocularity
was
given
the
souls
of
the
old
germans
waxed
gladsome
otherwise
they
were
depressed
but
here
they
found
something
they
really
understood
debauchery
at
when
the
of
athens
acquired
its
thinkers
and
poets
greek
debauchery
had
a
more
idyllic
and
refined
appearance
than
roman
or
german
debauchery
ever
had
the
voice
of
juvenal
would
have
sounded
there
like
a
hollow
trumpet
and
would
have
been
answered
by
a
and
almost
childish
outburst
of
laughter
cleverness
of
the
the
desire
for
victory
and
is
an
ineradicable
trait
of
human
nature
older
and
more
primitive
than
any
respect
of
or
joy
in
equality
the
greek
state
sanctioned
gymnastic
and
artistic
competitions
among
equals
in
other
words
it
marked
out
an
arena
where
this
impulse
to
conquer
would
find
a
vent
without
jeopardising
the
political
order
with
the
final
decline
of
gymnastic
and
artistic
contests
the
greek
state
fell
into
a
condition
of
profound
unrest
and
dissolution
the
eternal
has
lived
in
all
periods
and
lives
yet
unbeknown
to
those
who
called
and
still
call
themselves
epicureans
and
without
repute
among
philosophers
he
has
himself
even
forgotten
his
own
was
the
heaviest
luggage
that
he
ever
cast
off
the
style
of
university
slang
the
speech
of
the
german
students
has
its
origin
among
the
students
who
do
not
study
the
latter
know
how
to
acquire
a
preponderance
over
their
more
serious
fellows
by
exposing
all
the
farcical
elements
of
culture
respectability
erudition
order
and
moderation
and
by
having
words
taken
from
these
realms
always
on
their
lips
like
the
better
and
more
learned
students
but
with
malice
in
their
glance
and
an
accompanying
grimace
this
language
of
only
one
that
is
original
in
nowadays
unconsciously
used
by
statesmen
and
newspaper
critics
as
well
it
is
a
continual
process
of
ironical
quotation
a
restless
cantankerous
squinting
of
the
eye
right
and
left
a
language
of
inverted
commas
and
grimaces
the
retire
into
seclusion
but
not
from
personal
misgivings
as
if
the
political
and
social
conditions
of
the
day
did
not
satisfy
us
rather
because
by
our
retirement
we
try
to
save
and
collect
forces
which
will
some
day
be
urgently
needed
by
culture
the
more
this
present
is
and
as
such
fulfils
its
task
we
form
a
capital
and
try
to
make
it
secure
but
as
in
times
of
real
danger
our
method
is
to
bury
our
hoard
tyrants
of
the
our
times
any
one
who
expressed
a
single
moral
trait
so
thoroughly
as
the
characters
of
theophrastus
and
molière
do
would
be
considered
ill
and
be
spoken
of
as
possessing
a
fixed
the
athens
of
the
third
century
if
we
could
visit
it
would
appear
to
us
populated
by
fools
nowadays
the
democracy
of
ideas
rules
in
every
the
multitude
collectively
is
lord
a
single
idea
that
tried
to
be
lord
is
now
called
as
above
stated
a
fixed
this
is
our
method
of
murdering
hint
at
the
madhouse
a
most
dangerous
russia
there
is
an
emigration
of
the
intelligence
people
cross
the
frontier
in
order
to
read
and
write
good
books
thus
however
they
are
working
towards
turning
their
country
abandoned
by
the
intellect
into
a
gaping
asiatic
maw
which
would
fain
swallow
our
little
europe
political
almost
religious
love
of
the
king
was
transferred
by
the
greeks
when
the
monarchy
was
abolished
to
the
an
idea
can
be
loved
more
than
a
person
and
does
not
thwart
the
lover
so
often
as
a
beloved
human
being
for
the
more
men
know
themselves
to
be
loved
the
less
considerate
they
usually
become
until
they
are
no
longer
worthy
of
love
and
a
rift
really
arises
hence
the
reverence
for
state
and
was
greater
than
the
reverence
for
princes
had
ever
been
the
greeks
are
the
political
fools
of
ancient
other
nations
boast
that
distinction
against
neglect
of
the
one
not
find
among
the
cultured
classes
of
england
who
read
the
a
decline
in
their
powers
of
sight
every
ten
years
great
works
and
great
man
had
great
works
but
his
comrade
had
great
faith
in
these
works
they
were
inseparable
but
obviously
the
former
was
entirely
dependent
upon
the
latter
the
sociable
i
don
t
get
on
well
with
myself
said
some
one
in
explanation
of
his
fondness
for
society
society
has
a
stronger
digestion
than
i
have
and
can
put
up
with
shutting
the
mind
s
we
are
practised
and
accustomed
to
reflect
upon
our
actions
we
must
nevertheless
close
the
inner
eye
while
performing
an
action
be
this
even
only
writing
letters
or
eating
or
drinking
even
in
conversation
with
average
people
we
must
know
how
to
obscure
our
own
mental
vision
in
order
to
attain
and
grasp
average
thinking
this
shutting
of
the
eyes
is
a
conscious
act
and
can
be
achieved
by
the
will
the
most
terrible
we
wish
to
take
a
thorough
revenge
upon
an
opponent
we
must
wait
until
we
have
our
hand
quite
full
of
truths
and
equities
and
can
calmly
use
the
whole
lot
against
him
hence
the
exercise
of
revenge
may
be
identified
with
the
exercise
of
equity
it
is
the
most
terrible
kind
of
revenge
for
there
is
no
higher
court
to
which
an
appeal
can
be
made
thus
did
voltaire
revenge
himself
on
piron
with
five
lines
that
sum
up
piron
s
whole
life
work
and
character
every
word
is
a
truth
so
too
he
revenged
himself
upon
frederick
the
great
in
a
letter
to
him
from
ferney
taxes
of
shops
we
buy
the
most
necessary
and
urgent
things
and
have
to
pay
very
dear
because
we
pay
as
well
for
what
is
also
to
be
had
there
cheap
but
seldom
finds
a
of
luxury
that
minister
to
pleasure
thus
luxury
lays
a
constant
tax
upon
the
man
of
simple
life
who
does
without
luxuries
why
beggars
still
all
alms
were
given
only
out
of
compassion
the
whole
tribe
of
beggars
would
long
since
have
died
of
starvation
why
beggars
still
greatest
of
almsgivers
is
cowardice
how
the
thinker
makes
use
of
a
being
eavesdroppers
we
can
hear
a
good
deal
if
we
are
able
to
see
well
and
at
the
same
time
to
let
ourselves
occasionally
get
out
of
our
own
sight
but
people
do
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
a
conversation
they
pay
far
too
much
attention
to
what
want
to
say
and
reply
whereas
the
true
listener
is
often
contented
to
make
a
provisional
answer
and
to
say
something
merely
as
a
payment
on
account
of
politeness
but
on
the
other
hand
with
his
memory
lurking
in
ambush
carries
away
with
him
all
that
the
other
said
together
with
his
tones
and
gestures
in
ordinary
conversation
every
one
thinks
is
the
leader
just
as
if
two
ships
sailing
side
by
side
and
giving
each
other
a
slight
push
here
and
there
were
each
firmly
convinced
that
the
other
ship
was
following
or
even
being
towed
the
art
of
excusing
some
one
excuses
himself
to
us
he
has
to
make
out
a
very
good
case
otherwise
we
readily
come
to
feel
ourselves
the
culprits
and
experience
an
unpleasant
emotion
impossible
ship
of
your
thoughts
goes
too
deep
for
you
to
be
able
to
travel
with
it
in
the
waters
of
these
friendly
decorous
obliging
people
there
are
too
many
shallows
and
sandbanks
you
would
have
to
tack
and
turn
and
would
find
yourself
continually
at
your
wits
end
and
they
would
soon
also
be
in
perplexity
as

perplexity
the
reason
for
which
they
can
not
divine
the
fox
of

not
only
calls
sour
the
grapes
he
can
not
reach
but
also
those
he
has
reached

snatched
from
the

of
others
in

men

connected
there
are
still
all
the
four
quarters
of
the
heavens
in
their
common
horizon
and
at
times
they
become
aware
of
this
fact
the
silence
of
some
one
undergoes
a
thorough
and
painful
transformation
as
thinker
and
human
being
and
makes
a
public
avowal
of
the
change
and
those
who
hear
him
see
nothing
and
still
believe
he
is
the
same
as
before
this
common
experience
has
already
disgusted
many
writers
they
had
rated
the
intellectuality
of
mankind
too
highly
and
made
a
vow
to
be
silent
as
soon
as
they
became
aware
of
their
mistake
business
business
of
many
rich
and
eminent
men
is
their
form
of
recreation
from
too
long
periods
of
habitual
leisure
they
then
become
as
serious
and
impassioned
as
other
people
do
in
their
rare
moments
of
leisure
and
amusement
the
eye
s
double
as
a
sudden
scaly
ripple
runs
over
the
waters
at
your
feet
so
there
are
similar
sudden
uncertainties
and
ambiguities
in
the
human
eye
they
lead
to
the
question
is
it
a
shudder
or
a
smile
or
both
positive
and
thinker
needs
no
one
to
refute
is
quite
capable
of
doing
that
himself
the
revenge
of
the
empty
all
we
should
beware
of
those
who
have
the
bitter
feeling
of
the
fisherman
who
after
a
hard
day
s
work
comes
home
in
the
evening
with
nets
empty
of
our
exertion
of
power
is
laborious
and
demands
courage
that
is
why
so
many
do
not
assert
their
most
valid
rights
because
their
rights
are
a
kind
of
power
and
they
are
too
lazy
or
too
cowardly
to
exercise
them
and
are
the
names
given
to
the
virtues
that
cloak
these
faults
bearers
of
society
there
would
be
no
sunshine
if
the
born
flatterers
i
mean
the
amiable
people
did
not
bring
some
in
with
them
when
most
a
man
has
been
highly
honoured
and
has
eaten
a
little
he
is
most
benevolent
to
the
press
forward
to
the
light
not
in
order
to
see
better
but
to
shine
person
before
whom
we
shine
we
gladly
allow
to
be
called
a
light
the
hypochondriac
is
a
man
who
has
just
enough
intellect
and
pleasure
in
the
intellect
to
take
his
sorrows
his
losses
and
his
mistakes
seriously
but
the
field
on
which
he
grazes
is
too
small
he
crops
it
so
close
that
in
the
end
he
has
to
look
for
single
stalks
thus
he
finally
becomes
envious
and
only
then
is
he
unbearable
giving
in
advises
us
to
give
the
neighbour
who
has
helped
us
good
measure
and
if
possible
fuller
measure
in
return
as
soon
as
we
have
the
power
for
this
is
where
the
neighbour
s
pleasure
comes
in
since
his
former
benevolence
brings
him
interest
moreover
he
who
gives
in
return
also
has
his
pleasure
inasmuch
as
by
giving
a
little
more
than
he
got
he
redeems
the
slight
humiliation
of
being
compelled
to
seek
aid
more
subtle
than
is
sense
of
observation
for
how
far
others
perceive
our
weaknesses
is
far
more
subtle
than
our
sense
of
observation
for
the
weaknesses
of
others
it
follows
that
the
sense
is
more
subtle
than
is
necessary
a
kind
of
bright
to
the
nocturnal
type
of
man
we
almost
regularly
find
as
if
bound
up
with
him
a
bright
soul
this
is
as
it
were
the
negative
shadow
cast
by
the
former
not
to
take
are
so
many
subtle
sorts
of
revenge
that
one
who
has
occasion
to
take
revenge
can
really
do
or
omit
to
do
what
he
likes
in
any
case
the
whole
world
will
agree
after
a
time
that
he
avenged
himself
hence
the
avoidance
of
revenge
is
hardly
within
man
s
power
he
must
not
even
so
much
as
say
that
he
does
not
to
do
so
since
the
contempt
for
revenge
is
interpreted
and
felt
as
a
sublime
and
exquisite
form
of
follows
that
we
must
do
nothing
superfluous
the
mistake
of
those
who
pay
one
thinks
he
is
paying
a
most
agreeable
compliment
to
a
thinker
when
he
says
that
he
himself
hit
upon
exactly
the
same
idea
and
even
upon
the
same
expression
the
thinker
however
is
seldom
delighted
at
hearing
such
news
nay
rather
he
often
becomes
distrustful
of
his
own
thoughts
and
expressions
he
silently
resolves
to
revise
both
some
day
if
we
wish
to
pay
homage
to
any
one
we
must
beware
of
expressing
our
agreement
for
this
puts
us
on
the
same
it
is
a
matter
of
social
tact
to
listen
to
an
opinion
as
if
it
were
not
ours
or
even
travelled
beyond
the
limits
of
our
own
for
example
when
an
old
man
once
in
a
while
opens
the
storehouse
of
his
acquired
knowledge
letter
is
an
unannounced
visit
and
the
postman
is
the
intermediary
of
impolite
surprises
every
week
we
ought
to
have
one
hour
for
receiving
letters
and
then
go
and
take
a
bath
one
said
i
have
been
prejudiced
against
myself
from
childhood
upwards
and
hence
i
find
some
truth
in
every
censure
and
some
absurdity
in
every
eulogy
praise
i
generally
value
too
low
and
blame
too
high
the
path
to
few
hours
of
make
a
blackguard
and
a
saint
two
rather
similar
creatures
weariness
is
the
shortest
path
to
equality
and
finally
liberty
is
bestowed
by
sleep
we
begin
to
trace
to
its
source
a
real
scandalous
misrepresentation
we
shall
rarely
look
for
its
origin
in
our
honourable
and
straightforward
enemies
for
if
they
invented
anything
of
the
sort
about
us
they
as
being
our
enemies
would
gain
no
credence
those
however
to
whom
for
a
time
we
have
been
most
useful
but
who
from
some
reason
or
other
may
be
secretly
sure
that
they
will
obtain
no
more
from
persons
are
in
a
position
to
start
the
ball
of
slander
rolling
they
gain
credence
firstly
because
it
is
assumed
that
they
would
invent
nothing
likely
to
do
them
damage
secondly
because
they
have
learnt
to
know
us
a
consolation
the
man
may
say
to
himself
calumnies
are
diseases
of
others
that
break
out
in
your
body
they
prove
that
society
is
a
moral
organism
so
that
you
can
prescribe
to
the
cure
that
will
in
the
end
be
useful
to
others
the
child
s
kingdom
of
happiness
of
a
child
is
as
much
of
a
myth
as
the
happiness
of
the
hyperboreans
of
whom
the
greeks
fabled
the
greeks
supposed
that
if
indeed
happiness
dwells
anywhere
on
our
earth
it
must
certainly
dwell
as
far
as
possible
from
us
perhaps
over
yonder
at
the
edge
of
the
world
old
people
have
the
same
man
is
at
all
capable
of
being
happy
he
must
be
happy
as
far
as
possible
from
our
age
at
the
frontiers
and
beginnings
of
life
for
many
a
man
the
sight
of
children
through
the
veil
of
this
myth
is
the
greatest
happiness
that
he
can
feel
he
enters
himself
into
the
forecourt
of
heaven
when
he
says
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
for
of
them
is
the
kingdom
of
the
myth
of
the
child
s
kingdom
of
heaven
holds
good
in
some
way
or
other
wherever
in
the
modern
world
some
sentimentality
exists
the
is
just
the
growing
man
who
does
not
want
things
in
the
growing
stage
he
is
too
impatient
for
that
the
youth
will
not
wait
until
after
long
study
suffering
and
privation
his
picture
of
men
and
things
is
complete
accordingly
he
confidently
accepts
another
picture
that
lies
ready
to
his
hand
and
is
recommended
to
him
and
pins
his
faith
to
that
as
if
it
must
give
him
at
once
the
lines
and
colours
of
his
own
painting
he
presses
a
philosopher
or
a
poet
to
his
bosom
and
must
from
that
time
forth
perform
long
stretches
of
forced
labour
and
renounce
his
own
self
he
learns
much
in
the
process
but
he
often
forgets
what
is
most
worth
learning
and
self
he
remains
all
his
life
a
partisan
ah
a
vast
amount
of
tedious
work
has
to
be
done
before
you
find
your
own
colours
your
own
brush
your
own
canvas
then
you
are
very
far
from
being
a
master
in
the
art
of
life
but
at
least
you
are
the
boss
in
your
own
workshop
there
are
no
thinkers
we
ought
only
to
speak
of
the
instruction
of
the
young
by
others
is
either
an
experiment
performed
upon
something
as
yet
unknown
and
unknowable
or
else
a
thorough
levelling
process
in
order
to
make
the
new
member
of
society
conform
to
the
customs
and
manners
that
prevail
for
the
time
being
in
both
cases
the
result
is
accordingly
unworthy
of
a
handiwork
of
parents
and
teachers
whom
some
valiantly
honest
person
has
called
ennemis
one
day
when
as
the
world
thinks
we
have
long
since
finished
our
education
we
then
begins
the
task
of
the
thinker
and
then
is
the
time
to
summon
him
to
our
as
a
teacher
but
as
a
man
who
has
experience
sympathy
with
are
sorry
when
we
hear
that
some
one
who
is
still
young
is
losing
his
teeth
or
growing
blind
if
we
knew
all
the
irrevocable
and
hopeless
feelings
hidden
in
his
whole
being
how
great
our
sorrow
would
be
why
do
we
really
suffer
on
this
account
because
youth
has
to
continue
the
work
we
have
undertaken
and
every
flaw
and
failing
in
its
strength
is
likely
to
injure
work
that
will
fall
into
its
hands
it
is
the
sorrow
at
the
imperfect
guarantee
of
our
immortality
or
if
we
only
feel
ourselves
as
executors
of
the
human
mission
it
is
the
sorrow
that
this
mission
must
pass
to
weaker
hands
than
ours
the
ages
of
comparison
of
the
four
ages
of
life
with
the
four
seasons
of
the
year
is
a
venerable
piece
of
folly
neither
the
first
twenty
nor
the
last
twenty
years
of
a
life
correspond
to
a
season
of
the
year
assuming
that
we
are
not
satisfied
with
drawing
a
parallel
between
white
hair
and
snow
and
similar
the
first
twenty
years
are
a
preparation
for
life
in
general
for
the
whole
year
of
life
a
sort
of
long
new
year
s
day
the
last
twenty
review
assimilate
bring
into
union
and
harmony
all
that
has
been
experienced
till
then
as
in
a
small
degree
we
do
on
every
new
year
s
eve
with
the
whole
past
year
but
in
between
there
really
lies
an
interval
which
suggests
a
comparison
with
the
time
from
the
twentieth
to
the
fiftieth
year
to
speak
here
of
decades
in
the
lump
while
it
is
an
understood
thing
that
every
one
must
refine
for
himself
these
rough
outlines
those
three
decades
correspond
to
three
spring
and
autumn
winter
human
life
has
none
unless
we
like
to
call
the
unfortunately
often
intervening
hard
cold
lonely
hopeless
unfruitful
periods
of
disease
the
winters
of
man
the
twenties
hot
oppressive
stormy
impetuous
exhausting
years
when
we
praise
the
day
in
the
evening
when
it
is
over
as
we
wipe
the
sweat
from
our
in
which
work
seems
to
us
cruel
but
twenties
are
the
summer
of
life
the
thirties
on
the
other
hand
are
its
with
the
air
now
too
warm
now
too
cold
ever
restless
and
stimulating
bubbling
sap
bloom
of
leaves
fragrance
of
buds
everywhere
many
delightful
mornings
and
evenings
work
to
which
the
song
of
birds
awakens
us
a
true
work
of
the
heart
a
kind
of
joy
in
our
own
robustness
strengthened
by
the
savour
of
hopeful
anticipation
lastly
the
forties
mysterious
like
all
that
is
stationary
like
a
high
broad
plateau
traversed
by
a
fresh
breeze
with
a
clear
cloudless
sky
above
it
which
always
has
the
same
gentle
look
all
day
and
half
the
time
of
harvest
and
cordial
is
the
autumn
of
life
women
s
intellect
in
modern
women
nowadays
think
of
men
s
intellect
may
be
divined
from
the
fact
that
in
their
art
of
adornment
they
think
of
anything
but
of
emphasising
the
intellectual
side
of
their
faces
or
their
single
intellectual
features
on
the
contrary
they
conceal
such
traits
and
understand
for
example
by
an
arrangement
of
their
hair
over
their
forehead
how
to
give
themselves
an
appearance
of
vivid
eager
sensuality
and
materialism
just
when
they
but
slightly
possess
those
qualities
their
conviction
that
intellect
in
women
frightens
men
goes
so
far
that
they
even
gladly
deny
the
keenness
of
the
most
intellectual
sense
and
purposely
invite
the
reputation
of
they
think
they
will
thereby
make
men
more
confiding
it
is
as
if
a
soft
attractive
twilight
were
spreading
itself
around
them
great
and
moves
the
observer
to
tears
is
the
rapturous
look
of
happiness
with
which
a
fair
young
bride
gazes
upon
her
husband
we
feel
all
the
melancholy
of
autumn
in
thinking
of
the
greatness
and
of
the
transitoriness
of
human
happiness
sense
and
a
woman
has
the
del
and
no
longer
enjoys
life
when
her
husband
refuses
to
sacrifice
her
with
all
her
wit
she
then
no
longer
and
without
perceiving
it
is
changed
from
sacrificial
victim
to
sacrificial
priest
the
stupid
as
a
man
say
the
women
cowardly
as
a
woman
say
the
men
stupidity
in
a
woman
is
unfeminine
masculine
and
feminine
temperament
and
the
male
sex
has
a
worse
temperament
than
the
female
follows
from
the
fact
that
male
children
have
a
greater
mortality
than
female
clearly
because
they
leap
out
of
their
skins
more
easily
their
wildness
and
unbearableness
soon
make
all
the
bad
stuff
in
them
deadly
the
age
of
cyclopean
democratisation
of
europe
is
a
resistless
force
even
he
who
would
stem
the
tide
uses
those
very
means
that
democratic
thought
first
put
into
men
s
hands
and
he
makes
these
means
more
handy
and
workable
the
most
inveterate
enemies
of
democracy
i
mean
the
spirits
of
upheaval
seem
only
to
exist
in
order
by
the
fear
that
they
inspire
to
drive
forward
the
different
parties
faster
and
faster
on
the
democratic
course
now
we
may
well
feel
sorry
for
those
who
are
working
consciously
and
honourably
for
this
future
there
is
something
dreary
and
monotonous
in
their
faces
and
the
grey
dust
seems
to
have
been
wafted
into
their
very
brains
nevertheless
posterity
may
possibly
some
day
laugh
at
our
anxiety
and
see
in
the
democratic
work
of
several
generations
what
we
see
in
the
building
of
stone
dams
and
activity
that
necessarily
covers
clothes
and
face
with
a
great
deal
of
dust
and
perhaps
unavoidably
makes
the
workmen
too
a
little
but
who
would
on
that
account
desire
such
work
undone
it
seems
that
the
democratisation
of
europe
is
a
link
in
the
chain
of
those
mighty
prophylactic
principles
which
are
the
thought
of
the
modern
era
and
whereby
we
rise
up
in
revolt
against
the
middle
ages
now
and
now
only
is
the
age
of
cyclopean
building
a
final
security
in
the
foundations
that
the
future
may
build
on
them
without
danger
henceforth
an
impossibility
of
the
orchards
of
culture
being
once
more
destroyed
overnight
by
wild
senseless
mountain
torrents
dams
and
walls
against
barbarians
against
plagues
against
physical
and
spiritual
serfdom
and
all
this
understood
at
first
roughly
and
literally
but
gradually
in
an
ever
higher
and
more
spiritual
sense
so
that
all
the
principles
here
indicated
may
appear
as
the
intellectual
preparation
of
the
highest
artist
in
horticulture
who
can
only
apply
himself
to
his
own
task
when
the
other
is
fully
accomplished
if
we
consider
the
long
intervals
of
time
that
here
lie
between
means
and
end
the
great
supreme
labour
straining
the
powers
and
brains
of
centuries
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
create
or
to
provide
each
individual
means
we
must
not
bear
too
hardly
upon
the
workers
of
the
present
when
they
loudly
proclaim
that
the
wall
and
the
fence
are
already
the
end
and
the
final
goal
after
all
no
one
yet
sees
the
gardener
and
the
fruit
for
whose
sake
the
fence
exists
the
right
of
universal
people
has
not
granted
itself
universal
suffrage
but
wherever
this
is
now
in
force
it
has
received
and
accepted
it
as
a
temporary
measure
but
in
any
case
the
people
has
the
right
to
restore
the
gift
if
it
does
not
satisfy
its
anticipations
this
dissatisfaction
seems
universal
nowadays
for
when
at
any
occasion
where
the
vote
is
exercised
scarce
nay
perhaps
not
even
the
majority
of
all
voters
go
to
the
polls
that
very
fact
is
a
vote
against
the
whole
suffrage
this
point
in
fact
we
must
pronounce
a
much
sterner
verdict
a
law
that
enacts
that
the
majority
shall
decide
as
to
the
welfare
of
all
can
not
be
built
up
on
the
foundation
that
it
alone
has
provided
for
it
is
bound
to
require
a
far
broader
foundation
namely
the
unanimity
of
all
universal
suffrage
must
not
only
be
the
expression
of
the
will
of
a
majority
but
of
the
whole
country
thus
the
dissent
of
a
very
small
minority
is
already
enough
to
set
aside
the
system
as
impracticable
and
the
abstention
from
voting
is
in
fact
a
dissent
of
this
kind
which
ruins
the
whole
institution
the
absolute
veto
of
the

that

human

is

and

often
takes
the
form
of
setting

in
we
hear
all
this
we
at
once
say
this
is
a
picture
of
a
barbarous
society
that
rests
on
a
hazardous
one
man
perhaps
will
add
it
is
a
portrait
of
but
another
will
become
meditative
and
declare
that
this
is
a
description
of
our
modern
military
system
as
it
exists
in
the
midst
of
our
altogether
different
culture
and
society
a
living
anachronism
the
picture
as
above
said
of
a
community
resting
on
a
hazardous
footing
a
posthumous
work
of
the
past
which
can
only
act
as
a
drag
upon
the
wheels
of
the
at
times
even
a
drag
upon
culture
is
vitally
is
to
say
when
culture
is
advancing
too
rapidly
downhill
or
as
perhaps
in
this
case
more
reverence
for
them
that
the
competition
of
production
and
sale
the
public
is
made
judge
of
the
product
but
the
public
has
no
special
knowledge
and
judges
by
the
appearance
of
the
wares
in
consequence
the
art
of
appearance
and
perhaps
the
taste
for
it
must
increase
under
the
dominance
of
competition
while
on
the
other
hand
the
quality
of
every
product
must
deteriorate
the
result
will
far
as
reason
does
not
fall
in
one
day
an
end
will
be
put
to
that
competition
and
a
new
principle
will
win
the
day
only
the
master
of
the
craft
should
pronounce
a
verdict
on
the
work
and
the
public
should
be
dependent
on
the
belief
in
the
personality
of
the
judge
and
his
honesty
accordingly
no
anonymous
work
at
least
an
expert
should
be
there
as
guarantor
and
pledge
his
name
if
the
name
of
the
creator
is
lacking
or
is
unknown
the
cheapness
of
an
article
is
for
the
layman
another
kind
of
illusion
and
deceit
since
only
durability
can
decide
that
a
thing
is
cheap
and
to
what
an
extent
but
it
is
difficult
and
for
a
layman
impossible
to
judge
of
its
that
which
produces
an
effect
on
the
eye
and
costs
little
at
present
gains
the
being
naturally
work
again
is
to
say
the
cause
of
the
greatest
rapidity
and
facility
in
the
most
saleable
kind
of
article
otherwise
it
involves
no
tangible
profit
it
would
be
too
little
used
and
too
often
stand
idle
but
as
to
what
is
most
saleable
the
public
as
above
said
decides
it
must
be
the
most
other
words
the
thing
that
appears
good
and
also
appears
cheap
thus
in
the
domain
of
labour
our
motto
must
also
hold
good
more
respect
for
them
that
know
the
danger
of
has
it
in
its
power
without
any
violent
means
and
only
by
a
lawful
pressure
steadily
exerted
to
make
kingship
and
emperorship
hollow
until
only
a
zero
remains
perhaps
with
the
significance
of
every
zero
in
that
while
nothing
in
itself
it
multiplies
a
number
tenfold
if
placed
on
the
right
side
kingship
and
emperorship
would
remain
a
gorgeous
ornament
upon
the
simple
and
appropriate
dress
of
democracy
a
beautiful
superfluity
that
democracy
allows
itself
a
relic
of
all
the
historically
venerable
primitive
ornaments
nay
the
symbol
of
history
itself
and
in
this
unique
position
a
highly
effective
thing
if
as
above
said
it
does
not
stand
alone
but
is
put
on
the
right
order
to
avoid
the
danger
of
this
nullification
kings
hold
by
their
teeth
to
their
dignity
as
to
this
end
they
need
wars
or
in
other
words
exceptional
circumstances
in
which
that
slow
lawful
pressure
of
the
democratic
forces
is
relaxed
the
teacher
a
necessary
us
have
as
few
people
as
possible
between
the
productive
minds
and
the
hungry
and
recipient
minds
the
middlemen
almost
unconsciously
adulterate
the
food
which
they
supply
for
their
work
as
middlemen
they
want
too
high
a
fee
for
themselves
and
this
is
drawn
from
the
original
productive
interest
admiration
leisure
money
and
other
we
should
always
look
upon
the
teacher
as
a
necessary
evil
just
like
the
merchant
as
an
evil
that
we
should
make
as
small
as
the
prevailing
distress
in
germany
has
its
main
cause
in
the
fact
that
too
many
wish
to
live
and
live
well
by
trade
in
other
words
desiring
as
far
as
possible
to
diminish
prices
for
the
producer
and
raise
prices
for
the
consumer
and
thus
to
profit
by
the
greatest
possible
loss
to
both
in
the
same
way
we
may
certainly
trace
a
main
cause
of
the
prevailing
intellectual
poverty
in
the
superabundance
of
teachers
it
is
because
of
teachers
that
so
little
is
learnt
and
that
so
badly
the
tax
of
whom
we
know
and
honour
he
physician
artist
or
artisan
does
and
produces
something
for
us
we
gladly
pay
as
highly
as
we
can
often
a
fee
beyond
our
means
on
the
other
hand
we
pay
the
unknown
as
low
a
price
as
possible
here
is
a
contest
in
which
every
one
struggles
and
makes
others
struggle
for
a
foot
s
breadth
of
land
in
the
work
of
the
known
there
is
something
that
can
not
be
bought
the
sentiment
and
ingenuity
put
into
his
work
for
our
own
sake
we
think
we
can
not
better
express
our
sense
of
obligation
than
by
a
sort
of
sacrifice
on
our
heaviest
tax
is
the
tax
of
homage
the
more
competition
prevails
the
more
we
buy
for
the
unknown
and
work
for
the
unknown
the
lower
does
this
tax
become
whereas
it
is
really
the
standard
for
the
loftiness
of
man
s
spiritual
intercourse
the
means
towards
genuine
government
will
nowadays
admit
that
it
maintains
an
army
in
order
to
satisfy
occasionally
its
passion
for
conquest
the
army
is
said
to
serve
only
defensive
purposes
this
morality
which
justifies
is
called
in
as
the
government
s
advocate
this
means
however
reserving
morality
for
ourselves
and
immorality
for
our
neighbour
because
he
must
be
thought
eager
for
attack
and
conquest
if
our
state
is
forced
to
consider
means
of
the
same
time
by
our
explanation
of
our
need
of
an
army
because
he
denies
the
lust
of
attack
just
as
our
state
does
and
ostensibly
also
maintains
his
army
for
defensive
reasons
we
proclaim
him
a
hypocrite
and
cunning
criminal
who
would
fain
seize
by
surprise
without
any
fighting
a
harmless
and
unwary
victim
in
this
attitude
all
states
face
each
other
they
presuppose
evil
intentions
on
their
neighbour
s
part
and
good
intentions
on
their
own
this
hypothesis
however
is
an
notion
as
bad
as
and
worse
than
war
nay
at
bottom
it
is
a
challenge
and
motive
to
war
foisting
as
it
does
upon
the
neighbouring
state
the
charge
of
immorality
and
thus
provoking
hostile
intentions
and
acts
the
doctrine
of
the
army
as
a
means
of
must
be
abjured
as
completely
as
the
lust
of
conquest
perhaps
a
memorable
day
will
come
when
a
nation
renowned
in
wars
and
victories
distinguished
by
the
highest
development
of
military
order
and
intelligence
and
accustomed
to
make
the
heaviest
sacrifice
to
these
objects
will
voluntarily
exclaim
we
will
break
our
swords
and
will
destroy
its
whole
military
system
lock
stock
and
barrel
making
ourselves
defenceless
after
having
been
the
most
strongly
defended
from
a
loftiness
of
is
the
means
towards
genuine
peace
which
must
always
rest
upon
a
pacific
disposition
the
armed
peace
that
prevails
at
present
in
all
countries
is
a
sign
of
a
bellicose
disposition
of
a
disposition
that
trusts
neither
itself
nor
its
neighbour
and
partly
from
hate
partly
from
fear
refuses
to
lay
down
its
weapons
better
to
perish
than
to
hate
and
fear
and
twice
as
far
better
to
perish
than
to
make
oneself
hated
and
must
some
day
become
the
supreme
maxim
of
every
political
community
liberal
representatives
of
the
people
as
is
well
known
have
not
the
time
for
reflection
on
the
nature
of
humanity
or
else
they
would
know
that
they
are
working
in
vain
when
they
work
for
a
gradual
diminution
of
the
military
on
the
contrary
when
the
distress
of
these
burdens
is
greatest
the
sort
of
god
who
alone
can
help
here
will
be
nearest
the
tree
of
military
glory
can
only
be
destroyed
at
one
swoop
with
one
stroke
of
lightning
but
as
you
know
lightning
comes
from
the
cloud
and
from
above
whether
property
can
be
squared
with
the
injustice
of
property
is
strongly
felt
and
the
hand
of
the
great
clock
is
once
more
at
this
place
we
formulate
two
methods
of
relieving
this
injustice
either
an
equal
distribution
or
an
abolition
of
private
possession
and
a
return
to
state
ownership
the
latter
method
is
especially
dear
to
the
hearts
of
our
socialists
who
are
angry
with
that
primitive
jew
for
saying
thou
shalt
not
in
their
view
the
eighth
commandment
should
rather
run
thou
shalt
not
former
method
was
frequently
tried
in
antiquity
always
indeed
on
a
small
scale
and
yet
with
poor
success
from
this
failure
we
too
may
learn
equal
plots
of
land
is
easily
enough
said
but
how
much
bitterness
is
aroused
by
the
necessary
division
and
separation
by
the
loss
of
possessions
how
much
piety
is
wounded
and
sacrificed
we
uproot
the
foundation
of
morality
when
we
uproot
again
how
much
fresh
bitterness
among
the
new
owners
how
much
envy
and
looking
askance
for
there
have
never
been
two
really
equal
plots
of
land
and
if
there
were
man
s
envy
of
his
neighbour
would
prevent
him
from
believing
in
their
equality
and
how
long
would
this
equality
unhealthy
and
poisoned
at
the
very
roots
endure
in
a
few
generations
by
inheritance
here
one
plot
would
come
to
five
owners
there
five
plots
to
one
even
supposing
that
men
acquiesced
in
such
abuses
through
the
enactment
of
stern
laws
of
inheritance
the
same
equal
plots
would
indeed
exist
but
there
would
also
be
needy
malcontents
owning
nothing
but
dislike
of
their
kinsmen
and
neighbours
and
longing
for
a
general
however
by
the
second
method
we
try
to
restore
ownership
to
the
community
and
make
the
individual
but
a
temporary
tenant
we
interfere
with
agriculture
for
man
is
opposed
to
all
that
is
only
a
transitory
possession
unblessed
with
his
own
care
and
sacrifice
with
such
property
he
behaves
in
freebooter
fashion
as
robber
or
as
worthless
spendthrift
when
plato
declares
that
would
be
removed
with
the
abolition
of
property
we
may
answer
him
that
if
be
taken
away
man
will
no
longer
possess
the
four
cardinal
virtues
either
as
we
must
say
that
the
most
deadly
plague
could
not
injure
mankind
so
terribly
as
if
vanity
were
one
day
to
disappear
without
vanity
and
what
are
human
virtues
by
this
i
am
far
from
meaning
that
these
virtues
are
but
varied
names
and
masks
for
these
two
qualities
plato
s
utopian
refrain
which
is
still
sung
by
socialists
rests
upon
a
deficient
knowledge
of
men
he
lacked
the
historical
science
of
moral
emotions
the
insight
into
the
origin
of
the
good
and
useful
characteristics
of
the
human
soul
he
believed
like
all
antiquity
in
good
and
evil
as
in
black
and
is
to
say
in
a
radical
difference
between
good
and
bad
men
and
good
and
bad
order
that
property
may
henceforth
inspire
more
confidence
and
become
more
moral
we
should
keep
open
all
the
paths
of
work
for
small
fortunes
but
should
prevent
the
effortless
and
sudden
acquisition
of
wealth
accordingly
we
should
take
all
the
branches
of
transport
and
trade
which
favour
the
accumulation
of
large
therefore
the
money
of
the
hands
of
private
persons
or
private
companies
and
look
upon
those
who
own
too
much
just
as
upon
those
who
own
nothing
as
types
fraught
with
danger
to
the
community
the
value
of
we
try
to
determine
the
value
of
labour
by
the
amount
of
time
industry
good
or
bad
will
constraint
inventiveness
or
laziness
honesty
or
bestowed
upon
it
the
valuation
can
never
be
a
just
one
for
the
whole
personality
would
have
to
be
thrown
into
the
scale
and
this
is
impossible
here
the
motto
is
judge
not
but
after
all
the
cry
for
justice
is
the
cry
we
now
hear
from
those
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
present
valuation
of
labour
if
we
reflect
further
we
find
every
person
for
his
product
the
labour
hence
merit
can
never
be
derived
therefrom
and
every
labour
is
as
good
or
as
bad
as
it
must
be
through
this
or
that
necessary
concatenation
of
forces
and
weaknesses
abilities
and
desires
the
worker
is
not
at
liberty
to
say
whether
he
shall
work
or
not
or
to
decide
how
he
shall
work
only
the
standpoints
of
usefulness
wider
and
narrower
have
created
the
valuation
of
labour
what
we
at
present
call
justice
does
very
well
in
this
sphere
as
a
highly
refined
utility
which
does
not
only
consider
the
moment
and
exploit
the
immediate
opportunity
but
looks
to
the
permanence
of
all
conditions
and
thus
also
keeps
in
view
the
of
the
worker
his
physical
and
spiritual
contentment
in
order
that
he
and
his
posterity
may
work
well
for
our
posterity
and
become
trustworthy
for
longer
periods
than
the
individual
span
of
human
life
the
of
the
worker
was
as
we
now
understand
a
piece
of
folly
a
robbery
at
the
expense
of
the
future
a
jeopardisation
of
society
we
almost
have
the
war
now
and
in
any
case
the
expense
of
maintaining
peace
of
concluding
treaties
and
winning
confidence
will
henceforth
be
very
great
because
the
folly
of
the
exploiters
was
very
great
and
of
the
study
of
the
social
worst
drawback
for
the
modern
student
of
economics
and
political
science
in
europe
and
especially
in
germany
is
that
the
actual
conditions
instead
of
exemplifying
rules
illustrate
exceptions
or
stages
of
transition
and
extinction
we
must
therefore
learn
to
look
beyond
actually
existing
conditions
and
for
example
turn
our
eyes
to
distant
north
america
where
we
can
still
contemplate
and
investigate
if
we
will
the
initial
and
normal
movement
of
the
social
body
in
germany
such
a
study
requires
arduous
and
historical
research
or
as
i
have
suggested
a
telescope
how
far
machinery
is
impersonal
it
robs
the
piece
of
work
of
its
pride
of
the
individual
merits
and
defects
that
cling
to
all
work
that
is
not
other
words
of
its
bit
of
humanity
formerly
all
buying
from
handicraftsmen
meant
a
mark
of
distinction
for
their
personalities
with
whose
productions
people
surrounded
themselves
furniture
and
dress
accordingly
became
the
symbols
of
mutual
valuation
and
personal
connection

the

thus
in

of

as
the

of
nations
depends
upon

the

of

will
always
be
the
object
of
patriotic
misgivings

victory
of

nowadays
attempt
to
exploit
the
fear
of
socialism
for
their
own
strengthening
yet
in
the
long
run
democracy
alone
gains
the
advantage
for
parties
are
now
compelled
to
flatter
the
masses
and
grant
them
facilities
and
liberties
of
all
kinds
with
the
result
that
the
masses
finally
become
omnipotent
the
masses
are
as
far
as
possible
removed
from

as
a
doctrine
of
altering
the
acquisition
of
property
if
once
they
get

through
great
majorities
in
their
parliaments
they
will
attack
with
progressive
taxation
the
whole
dominant
system
of
capitalists
merchants
and
financiers
and
will
in
fact
slowly
create
a
middle
class
which
may
forget

of

next
be

of

in
which
each
individual
nation
delimited
by
the
proper
geographical
frontiers
has
the
position
of
a
canton
with
its
separate
rights
small
account
will
be
taken
of
the
historic
memories
of
previously
existing
nations
because
the
pious
affection
for
these
memories
will
be
gradually
uprooted
under
the
democratic
régime
with
all
its
craze
for
novelty
and
experiment
the
corrections
of
frontiers
that
will
prove
necessary
will
be
so
carried
out
as
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
great
cantons
and
at
the
same
time
that
of
the
whole
federation
but
not
that
of
any
venerable
memories
to
find
the
standpoints
for
these
corrections
will
be
the
task
of
future
diplomats
who
will
have
to
be
at
the
same
time
students
of
civilisation
agriculturists
and
commercial
experts
with
no
armies
but
motives
and
utilities
at
their
back
then
only
will
foreign
and
home
politics
be
inseparably
connected
whereas
the
latter
follows
its
haughty
dictator
and
gleans
in
sorry
baskets

stubble
that
is
left
over
from
the
harvest
of

former

to
create
and
guarantee

for
as
many
as
possible
in
their
opinions
way
of
life
and

for
this
purpose
democracy
must
withhold
the
political
suffrage
both
from
those
who
have
nothing
and
from
those
who
are
really
rich
as
being
the
two
intolerable
classes
of
men
at
the
removal
of
these
classes
it
must
always
work
because
they
are
continually
calling
its
task
in
question
in
the
same
way
democracy
must
prevent
all
measures
that
seem
to
aim
at
party
organisation
for
the
three
great
foes
of
independence
in
that
threefold
sense
are
the
the

and
the

as
of
a

at
present
goes
by
that
name
is
distinguished
from
older
forms
of

only
by
the
fact
that
it

with

and
great
quality
of

which
is
fundamentally
the
virtue
of
virtues
their
ancestress
and
queen
has
in
common
life
by
no
means
always
success
on
its
side
the

would
find
himself
deceived
if
he
had
wooed
that
virtue
only
for
the
sake
of
success
for
it
is
rated
by
practical
people
as
suspicious
and
is
confused
with
cunning
and
hypocrisy
he
who
obviously
lacks
discretion
the
man
who
quickly
grasps
and
sometimes
misses
his
grasp
has
prejudice

an
honest
trustworthy

practical
people
accordingly
do
not
like
the
prudent
man
thinking
he
is
to
them
a
danger
moreover
we
often
assume
the
prudent
man
to
be
anxious
preoccupied
butterfly
people
find
him
uncomfortable
because
he
does
not
live
in
their
way
without
thinking
of
actions
and
duties
he
appears
among
them
as
their
embodied
conscience
and
the
bright

is
dimmed
to
their
eyes
before
his
gaze
thus
when
success
and
popularity
fail
him
he
may
often
say
by
way
of
private
consolation
so
high
are
the
taxes
you
have
to
pay
for
the
possession
of
the
most
precious
of

it
is
worth

over

of

to
a

through

and

austere
with

rocky
crags
of
all
shapes
about
me
the
soil
gay
with
flowers
and
grasses
a
herd
of
cattle
moved
stretched
and
expanded
itself
before
me
single
cows
and

in

by

in

pointed
to

the

of

stepped
into
the

foaming

and
went
forward
slowly

striving
against

giving

thus
no

took
his

of
fierce
pleasure

and
induced
to
a
mute
worship
of
the
moment
and
its
revelation
unconsciously
as
if
nothing
could
be
more
natural
you
peopled
this
pure
clear
world
of
light
which
had
no
trace
of
yearning
of
expectancy
of
looking
forward
or
backward
with
greek
heroes
you
felt
it
all
as
poussin
and
his
school
once
heroic
and
individual
men
too
have
lived
constantly
feeling
themselves
in
the
world
and
the
world
in
themselves
and
among
them
one
of
the
greatest
men
the
inventor
of
a
form
of
counting
and
art
of
seeing
many
things
of
weighing
one
with
another
of
reckoning
one
thing
with
another
and
constructing
from
them
a
rapid
conclusion
a
fairly
correct
goes
to
make
a
great
politician
or
general
or
merchant
this
quality
is
in
fact
a
power
of
speedy
mental
calculation
the
art
of
seeing
thing
alone
of
finding
therein
the
sole
motive
for
action
the
guiding
principle
of
all
other
action
goes
to
make
the
hero
and
also
the
fanatic
this
quality
means
a
dexterity
in
measuring
with
one
scale
not
to
see
too
long
as
we
undergo
some
experience
we
must
give
ourselves
up
to
the
experience
and
shut
our
other
words
not
become
observers
of
what
we
are
undergoing
for
to
observe
would
disturb
good
digestion
of
the
experience
and
instead
of
wisdom
we
should
gain
nothing
but
dyspepsia
from
the
practice
of
the
become
wise
we
must
to
undergo
certain
experiences
and
accordingly
leap
into
their
jaws
this
it
is
true
is
very
dangerous
many
a
sage
has
been
eaten
up
in
the
process
exhaustion
of
the
occasional
coldness
and
indifference
towards
people
which
is
imputed
to
us
as
hardness
and
defect
of
character
is
often
only
an
exhaustion
of
the
intellect
in
this
state
other
men
are
to
us
as
we
are
to
ourselves
tedious
or
immaterial
the
one
thing
we
are
clever
the
one
thing
we
need
is
to
have
joy
in
our
hearts
ah
adds
some
one
if
we
are
clever
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
be
a
sign
of
one
said
there
are
two
persons
about
whom
i
have
never
thought
deeply
that
is
a
sign
of
my
love
for
how
we
seek
to
improve

a
man
adds
a
bit
of
his
personality
to
his
bad
arguments
as
if
they
would
thus
go
better
and
change
into
straight
and
good
arguments
in
the
same
way
players
at
skittles
even
after
a
throw
try
to
give
a
direction
to
the
ball
by
turns
and
gestures
is
but
a
small
thing
to
be
a
pattern
sort
of
man
with
regard
to
rights
and
instance
to
name
trifling
points
which
of
course
give
a
better
proof
of
this
sort
of
pattern
nature
than
great
examples
if
as
a
boy
one
never
steals
fruit
from
another
s
orchard
and
as
a
man
never
walks
on
unmown
fields
it
is
but
little
you
are
then
still
only
a
person
with
just
that
degree
of
morality
of
which
a
society
a
group
of
human
beings
is
capable
man
is
the
vanity
of
the
vainest
individual
as
compared
with
the
vanity
which
the
most
modest
person
feels
when
he
thinks
of
his
position
in
nature
and
in
the
world
as
man
the
most
necessary
deficiency
in
in
small
matters
a
similar
deficiency
on
great
occasions
slowly
arises
every
day
on
which
we
have
not
at
least
once
denied
ourselves
some
is
turned
to
bad
use
and
a
danger
to
the
next
day
this
gymnastic
is
indispensable
if
we
wish
to
maintain
the
joy
of
being
our
own
master
losing
we
have
first
found
ourselves
we
must
understand
how
from
time
to
time
to
ourselves
and
then
to
find
ourselves
is
true
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
thinkers
a
thinker
finds
it
a
drawback
always
to
be
tied
to
one
person
when
it
is
necessary
to
must
for
a
time
at
least
part
from
that
which
you
want
to
know
and
measure
only
when
you
have
left
a
city
do
you
see
how
high
its
towers
rise
above
its
houses
at
to
whom
an
active
and
stormy
morning
of
life
is
allotted
at
the
noontide
of
life
feels
his
soul
overcome
by
a
strange
longing
for
a
rest
that
may
last
for
months
and
years
all
grows
silent
around
him
voices
sound
farther
and
farther
in
the
distance
the
sun
shines
straight
down
upon
him
on
a
hidden
woodland
sward
he
sees
the
great
god
pan
sleeping
and
with
pan
nature
seems
to
him
to
have
gone
to
sleep
with
an
expression
of
eternity
on
their
faces
he
wants
nothing
he
troubles
about
nothing
his
heart
stands
still
only
his
eye
lives
it
is
a
death
with
waking
eyes
then
man
sees
much
that
he
never
saw
before
and
so
far
as
his
eye
can
reach
all
is
woven
into
and
as
it
were
buried
in
a
net
of
light
he
feels
happy
but
it
is
a
heavy
very
heavy
kind
of
at
last
the
wind
stirs
in
the
trees
noontide
is
over
life
carries
him
away
again
life
with
its
blind
eyes
and
its
tempestuous
retinue
behind
illusion
oblivion
enjoyment
destruction
decay
and
so
comes
evening
more
stormy
and
more
active
than
was
even
the
the
really
active
man
these
prolonged
phases
of
cognition
seem
almost
uncanny
and
morbid
but
not
unpleasant
to
beware
of
one
s
great
painter
who
in
a
portrait
has
revealed
and
put
on
canvas
the
fullest
expression
and
look
of
which
a
man
is
capable
will
almost
always
think
when
he
sees
the
man
later
in
real
life
that
he
is
only
looking
at
a
caricature
the
two
principles
of
the
new
to
arrange
one
s
life
on
the
most
secure
and
tangible
basis
not
as
hitherto
upon
the
most
distant
undetermined
and
cloudy
foundation
to
establish
the
rank
of
the
nearest
and
nearer
things
and
of
the
more
and
less
secure
before
one
arranges
one
s
life
and
directs
it
to
a
final
end
dangerous
men
who
are
at
the
same
time
will
always
appear
somewhat
irritated
when
one
of
their
friends
has
accomplished
a
thorough
piece
of
work
their
jealousy
is
awakened
they
are
ashamed
of
their
own
laziness
or
rather
they
fear
that
their
active
friend
will
now
despise
them
even
more
than
before
in
such
a
mood
they
criticise
the
new
achievement
and
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
the
author
their
criticism
becomes
a
revenge
destructions
of
are
certainly
expensive
amusements
but
the
destruction
of
illusions
is
still
more
expensive
if
looked
upon
as
an
amusement
as
it
undoubtedly
is
by
some
people
the
monotone
of
the

have
a
look
of
wondering
which
stops
short
on
the
path
to
questioning
in
the
eye
of
the
higher
intelligence
on
the
other
hand
the
is
spread
out
like
the
monotony
of
the
cloudless
sky
not
to
be
ill
too
should
beware
of
being
ill
too
long
the
become
impatient
of
their
customary
duty
of
showing
sympathy
because
they
find
it
too
much
trouble
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
this
emotion
for
any
length
of
time
then
they
immediately
pass
to
suspicion
of
our
character
with
the
conclusion
you
deserve
to
be
ill
and
we
need
no
longer
be
at
pains
to
show
our
a
hint
to
who
likes
to
be
carried
away
and
would
fain
be
carried
on
high
must
beware
lest
he
become
too
heavy
for
instance
he
must
not
learn
much
and
especially
not
let
himself
be
crammed
with
science
science
makes
men
care
ye
enthusiasts
knowledge
of
how
to
surprise
who
would
see
himself
as
he
is
must
know
how
to
himself
torch
in
hand
for
with
the
mind
it
is
as
with
the
body
whoever
is
accustomed
to
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
forgets
his
ugliness
and
only
recognises
it
again
by
means
of
the
yet
he
even
grows
used
to
the
picture
and
forgets
his
ugliness
all
over
we
see
the
universal
law
that
man
can
not
endure
unalterable
ugliness
unless
for
a
moment
he
forgets
or
denies
it
in
all
moralists
must
reckon
upon
that
moment
for
bringing
forward
their
truths
opinions
and
are
possessors
of
our
opinions
as
of

in
so
far
as
we
are
possessors
of
a

pond
we
must
go
fishing
and
have
we

fish
opinions
i
speak
here
of

opinions

others
are
content
to
possess
a
cabinet
of
in
their
head
signs
of
freedom
and
satisfy
one

needs
so
far
as
possible
oneself
even
if
imperfectly
is
the
path
towards
freedom
in
mind
and
personality
to
satisfy
many
even
superfluous
needs
and
that
as
fully
as
possible
is
a
training
for
servitude
the
sophist
hippias
who
himself
earned
and
made
all
that
he
wore
within
and
without
is
the
representative
of
the
highest
freedom
of
mind
and
personality
it
does
not
matter
whether
all
is
done
equally
well
and
can
repair
the
damaged
places
belief
in
our
times
we
mistrust
every
one
who
believes
in
himself
formerly
this
was
enough
to
make
people
believe
in
one
the
recipe
for
finding
faith
now
runs
spare
not
thyself
in
order
to
set
thy
opinion
in
a
credible
light
thou
must
first
set
fire
to
thy
own
hut
at
once
richer
and
know
a
man
who
accustomed
himself
even
in
childhood
to
think
well
of
the
intellectuality
of
other
words
of
their
real
devotion
as
regards
things
of
the
intellect
their
unselfish
preference
for
that
which
is
recognised
as
who
had
at
the
same
time
a
modest
or
even
depreciatory
view
of
his
own
brain
judgment
memory
presence
of
mind
imagination
he
set
no
value
on
himself
when
he
compared
himself
with
others
now
in
the
course
of
years
he
was
compelled
first
once
and
then
in
a
hundred
ways
to
revise
this
verdict
one
would
have
thought
he
would
be
thoroughly
satisfied
and
delighted
such
in
fact
was
to
some
extent
the
case
but
as
he
once
said
yet
a
bitterness
of
the
deepest
dye
is
mingled
with
my
feeling
such
as
i
did
not
know
in
earlier
life
for
since
i
learnt
to
value
men
and
myself
more
correctly
my
intellect
seems
to
me
of
less
use
i
scarcely
think
i
can
now
do
any
good
at
all
with
it
because
the
minds
of
others
can
not
understand
the
good
i
now
always
see
before
me
the
frightful
gulf
between
those
who
could
give
help
and
those
who
need
help
so
i
am
troubled
by
the
misfortune
of
having
my
intellect
to
myself
and
of
being

reaches
the

the
spectators
who
generally
do
not

long
enough
too
readily
look
upon
such
a
man
as
callous
and
even
as
boring
when
it
is
time
to
vow
fidelity
to
sometimes
go
astray
in
an
intellectual
direction
which
does
not
correspond
to
our
talents
for
a
time
we
struggle
heroically
against
wind
and
tide
really
against
ourselves
but
finally
we
become
weary
and
we
pant
what
we
accomplish
gives
us
no
real
pleasure
since
we
think
that
we
have
paid
too
heavy
a
price
for
these
successes
we
even
despair
of
our
productivity
of
our
future
perhaps
in
the

we

swells
our
sails
and
bears
us
into
our
smooth
water
what
bliss
how
certain
of
victory
we
feel
only
now
do
we
know
what
we
are
and
what
we
intend
and
now
we
vow
fidelity
to
ourselves
and
have
a
right
to
do
men
that
know
weather
as
the
clouds
reveal
to
us
the
direction
of
the
wind
high
above
our
heads
so
the
lightest
and
freest
spirits
give
signs
of
future
weather
by
their
course

only
for

and
find
it

to
become

with
a

acquire
afterwards
the
quality
of

in
the

no
one
knows
where
the

his

even
in

can
say
true
there
are
many
grander

calmly
as
a

the

very

they
must
put
up

of

evilly

if

it
we
appear
to
them
older

of
superior
minds
find
it
difficult
to
free
themselves
from
an
illusion
for
they
imagine
that
they
excite

who
did
nothing

shake

soon
as
the

were

you

small
a

just
look
at

of

may

exactly
by
the
diminution
of
expressing

not
to
every
one
s
taste
to
hear
truth
pleasantly
expressed
but
let
no
one
at

believe
that
error
will
become
truth
if
it
is
disagreeably
expressed
the
golden
has
been
bound
with
many
chains
in
order
that
he
may
forget
to
comport
himself
like
an
animal
and
indeed
he
has
become
more
gentle
more
intellectual
more
joyous
more
meditative
than
any
animal
but
now
he
still
suffers
from
having
carried
his
chains
so
long
from
having
been
so
long
without
pure
air
and
free
chains
however
are
as
i
repeat
again
and
again
the
ponderous
and
significant
errors
of
moral
religious
and
metaphysical
ideas
only
when
the
disease
of
chains
is
overcome
is
the
first
great
goal
separation
of
man
from
the
brute
at
present
we
stand
in
the
midst
of
our
work
of
removing
the
chains
and
in
doing
so
we
need
the
strictest
precautions
only
the
ennobled
man
may
be
granted
freedom
of
spirit
to
him
alone
comes
the
alleviation
of
life
and
heals
his
wounds
he
is
the
first
who
can
say
that
he
lives
for
the
sake
of
joy
with
no
other
aim
in
any
other
mouth
his
motto
of
peace
around
me
and
goodwill
towards
all
the
most
familiar
things
would
be
this
motto
for
single
individuals
he
is
thinking
of
an
ancient
saying
magnificent
and
pathetic
which
applied
to
all
and
has
remained
standing
above
all
mankind
as
a
motto
and
a
beacon
whereby
shall
perish
all
who
adorn
their
banner
too
rock
on
which
christianity
foundered
it
is
not
even
yet
time
it
seems
for
to
have
the
lot
of
those
shepherds
who
saw
the
heavens
lit
up
above
them
and
heard
the
words
peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
to
one
another
among
is
still
the
age
of
the
individual
of
all
that
you
have
enunciated
nothing
pleased
me
more
than
one
promise
ye
want
again
to
be
good
neighbours
to
the
most
familiar
this
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
us
poor
shadows
too
for
do
but
confess
that
you
have
hitherto
been
only
too
fond
of
reviling
us
reviling
but
why
did
you
never
defend
yourselves
after
all
you
were
very
close
to
our
ears
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
were
too
near
you
to
have
a
right
to
talk
of
ourselves
what
delicacy
ah
you
shadows
are
better
men
than
we
i
can
see
that
and
yet
you
called
us
importunate
who
know
one
thing
at
least
extremely
well
how
to
be
silent
and
to
englishman
knows
it
better
it
is
true
we
are
very
very
often
in
the
retinue
of
men
but
never
as
their
bondsmen
when
man
shuns
light
we
shun
far
at
least
we
are
free
ah
light
shuns
man
far
oftener
and
then
also
you
abandon
him
it
has
often
pained
me
to
leave
you
i
am
eager
for
knowledge
and
much
in
man
has
remained
obscure
to
me
because
i
can
not
always
be
in
his
company
at
the
price
of
complete
knowledge
of
man
i
would
gladly
be
your
slave
do
you
know
do
i
know
whether
you
would
not
then
unwittingly
become
master
instead
of
slave
or
would
remain
a
slave
indeed
but
would
lead
a
life
of
humiliation
and
disgust
because
you
despised
your
master
let
us
both
be
content
with
freedom
such
as
you
have
enjoyed
up
to
and
i
for
the
sight
of
a
being
not
free
would
embitter
my
greatest
joys
all
that
is
best
would
be
repugnant
to
me
if
any
one
had
to
share
it
with
will
not
hear
of
any
slaves
about
me
that
is
why
i
do
not
care
for
the
dog
that
lazy
parasite
who
first
became
doggish
as
the
slave
of
man
and
of
whom
they
still
say
that
he
is
loyal
to
his
master
and
follows
him
like
his
shadow
they
say
perhaps
i
have
already
followed
you
too
long
it
has
been
the
longest
day
but
we
are
nearing
the
end
be
patient
a
little
more
the
grass
is
damp
i
am
feeling
chilly
oh
is
it
already
time
to
part
and
i
had
to
hurt
you
in
the
saw
you
became
darker
i
blushed
the
only
colour
i
have
at
command
i
remembered
that
i
had
often
lain
at
your
feet
like
a
dog
and
that
you
can
i
not
with
all
speed
do
something
to
please
you
have
you
no
wish
none
except
perhaps
the
wish
that
the
philosophic
dog
expressed
to
alexander

a
little
out
of
