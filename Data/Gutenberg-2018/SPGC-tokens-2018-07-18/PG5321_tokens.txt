introduction
it
is
no
common
thing
to
find
an
artist
who
even
if
he
be
willing
to
try
is
capable
of
expressing
his
aims
and
ideals
with
any
clearness
and
moderation
some
people
will
say
that
any
such
capacity
is
a
flaw
in
the
perfect
artist
who
should
find
his
expression
in
line
and
colour
and
leave
the
multitude
to
grope
its
way
unaided
towards
comprehension
this
attitude
is
a
relic
of
the
days
when
pour
was
the
latest
battle
cry
when
eccentricity
of
manner
and
irregularity
of
life
were
more
important
than
any
talent
to
the
artist
when
every
one
except
oneself
was
bourgeois
the
last
few
years
have
in
some
measure
removed
this
absurdity
by
destroying
the
old
convention
that
it
was
to
be
sane
and
that
between
the
artist
and
the
yawned
a
gulf
which
few
could
cross
modern
artists
are
beginning
to
realize
their
social
duties
they
are
the
spiritual
teachers
of
the
world
and
for
their
teaching
to
have
weight
it
must
be
comprehensible
any
attempt
therefore
to
bring
artist
and
public
into
sympathy
to
enable
the
latter
to
understand
the
ideals
of
the
former
should
be
thoroughly
welcome
and
such
an
attempt
is
this
book
of
kandinsky
the
author
is
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
new
art
movement
in
munich
the
group
of
which
he
is
a
member
includes
painters
poets
musicians
dramatists
critics
all
working
to
the
same
end
the
expression
of
the
soul
of
nature
and
humanity
or
as
kandinsky
terms
it
the
innerer
klang
perhaps
the
fault
of
this
book
of
theory
or
rather
the
characteristic
most
likely
to
give
cause
for
attack
is
the
tendency
to
verbosity
philosophy
especially
in
the
hands
of
a
writer
of
german
presents
inexhaustible
opportunities
for
vague
and
grandiloquent
language
partly
for
this
reason
partly
from
incompetence
i
have
not
primarily
attempted
to
deal
with
the
philosophical
basis
of
kandinsky
art
some
probably
will
find
in
this
aspect
of
the
book
its
chief
interest
but
better
service
will
be
done
to
the
author
ideas
by
leaving
them
to
the
reader
judgement
than
by
even
the
most
expert
criticism
the
power
of
a
book
to
excite
argument
is
often
the
best
proof
of
its
value
and
my
own
experience
has
always
been
that
those
new
ideas
are
at
once
most
challenging
and
most
stimulating
which
come
direct
from
their
author
with
no
intermediate
discussion
the
task
undertaken
in
this
introduction
is
a
humbler
but
perhaps
a
more
necessary
one
england
throughout
her
history
has
shown
scant
respect
for
sudden
spasms
of
theory
whether
in
politics
religion
or
art
she
demands
an
historical
foundation
for
every
belief
and
when
such
a
foundation
is
not
forthcoming
she
may
smile
indulgently
but
serious
interest
is
immediately
withdrawn
i
am
keenly
anxious
that
kandinsky
art
should
not
suffer
this
fate
my
personal
belief
in
his
sincerity
and
the
future
of
his
ideas
will
go
for
very
little
but
if
it
can
be
shown
that
he
is
a
reasonable
development
of
what
we
regard
as
serious
art
that
he
is
no
adventurer
striving
for
a
momentary
notoriety
by
the
strangeness
of
his
beliefs
then
there
is
a
chance
that
some
people
at
least
will
give
his
art
fair
consideration
and
that
of
these
people
a
few
will
come
to
love
it
as
in
my
opinion
it
deserves
that
vague
and
term
is
now
almost
a
household
word
that
the
name
of
the
movement
is
better
known
than
the
names
of
its
chief
leaders
is
a
sad
misfortune
largely
caused
by
the
of
its
introduction
into
england
within
the
space
of
two
short
years
a
mass
of
artists
from
manet
to
the
most
recent
of
cubists
were
thrust
on
a
public
who
had
hardly
realized
impressionism
the
inevitable
result
has
been
complete
mental
chaos
the
tradition
of
which
true
is
the
modern
expression
has
been
kept
alive
down
the
ages
of
european
art
by
scattered
and
until
lately
neglected
painters
but
not
since
the
time
of
the
byzantines
not
since
the
period
of
which
giotto
and
his
school
were
the
final
splendid
blossoming
has
the
symbolist
ideal
in
art
held
general
sway
over
the
naturalist
the
primitive
italians
like
their
predecessors
the
primitive
greeks
and
in
turn
their
predecessors
the
egyptians
sought
to
express
the
inner
feeling
rather
than
the
outer
reality
this
ideal
tended
to
be
lost
to
sight
in
the
naturalistic
revival
of
the
renaissance
which
derived
its
inspiration
solely
from
those
periods
of
greek
and
roman
art
which
were
with
the
expression
of
external
reality
although
the
genius
of
michelangelo
kept
the
symbolist
tradition
alive
it
is
the
work
of
el
greco
that
merits
the
complete
title
of
symbolist
from
el
greco
springs
goya
and
the
spanish
influence
on
daumier
and
manet
when
it
is
remembered
that
in
the
meantime
rembrandt
and
his
contemporaries
notably
brouwer
left
their
mark
on
french
art
in
the
work
of
delacroix
decamps
and
courbet
the
way
will
be
seen
clearly
open
to
cezanne
and
gauguin
the
phrase
symbolist
tradition
is
not
used
to
express
any
conscious
affinity
between
the
various
generations
of
artists
as
kandinsky
says
the
relationships
in
art
are
not
necessarily
ones
of
outward
form
but
are
founded
on
inner
sympathy
of
meaning
sometimes
perhaps
frequently
a
similarity
of
outward
form
will
appear
but
in
tracing
spiritual
relationship
only
inner
meaning
must
be
taken
into
account
there
are
of
course
many
people
who
deny
that
primitive
art
had
an
inner
meaning
or
rather
that
what
is
called
archaic
expression
was
dictated
by
anything
but
ignorance
of
representative
methods
and
defective
materials
such
people
are
numbered
among
the
bitterest
opponents
of
and
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
they
could
be
otherwise
painting
they
say
which
seeks
to
learn
from
an
age
when
art
was
however
sincere
incompetent
and
uneducated
deliberately
rejects
the
knowledge
and
skill
of
centuries
it
will
be
no
easy
matter
to
conquer
this
assumption
that
primitive
art
is
merely
untrained
naturalism
but
until
it
is
conquered
there
seems
little
hope
for
a
sympathetic
understanding
of
the
symbolist
ideal
the
task
is
all
the
more
difficult
because
of
the
analogy
drawn
by
friends
of
the
new
movement
between
the
vision
and
that
of
a
child
that
the
analogy
contains
a
grain
of
truth
does
not
make
it
the
less
mischievous
freshness
of
vision
the
child
has
and
freshness
of
vision
is
an
important
element
in
the
new
movement
but
beyond
this
a
parallel
is
must
be
in
any
art
other
than
pure
artificiality
it
is
one
thing
to
ape
ineptitude
in
technique
and
another
to
acquire
simplicity
of
vision
simplicity
or
rather
discrimination
of
vision
is
the
trademark
of
the
true
he
observes
and
then
selects
what
is
essential
the
result
is
a
logical
and
very
sophisticated
synthesis
such
a
synthesis
will
find
expression
in
simple
and
even
harsh
technique
but
the
process
can
only
come
after
the
naturalist
process
and
not
before
it
the
child
has
a
direct
vision
because
his
mind
is
unencumbered
by
association
and
because
his
power
of
concentration
is
unimpaired
by
a
multiplicity
of
interests
his
method
of
drawing
is
immature
its
variations
from
the
ordinary
result
from
lack
of
capacity
two
examples
will
make
my
meaning
clearer
the
child
draws
a
landscape
his
picture
contains
one
or
two
objects
only
from
the
number
before
his
eyes
these
are
the
objects
which
strike
him
as
important
so
far
good
but
there
is
no
relation
between
them
they
stand
isolated
on
his
paper
mere
lumpish
shapes
the
however
selects
his
objects
with
a
view
to
expressing
by
their
means
the
whole
feeling
of
the
landscape
his
choice
falls
on
elements
which
sum
up
the
whole
not
those
which
first
attract
immediate
attention
again
let
us
take
the
case
of
the
definitely
religious
picture
footnote
religion
in
the
sense
of
awe
is
present
in
all
true
art
but
here
i
use
the
term
in
the
narrower
sense
to
mean
pictures
of
which
the
subject
is
connected
with
christian
or
other
worship
it
is
not
often
that
children
draw
religious
scenes
more
often
battles
and
pageants
attract
them
but
since
the
revival
of
the
religious
picture
is
so
noticeable
a
factor
in
the
new
movement
since
the
byzantines
painted
almost
entirely
religious
subjects
and
finally
since
a
book
of
such
drawings
by
a
child
of
twelve
has
recently
been
published
i
prefer
to
take
them
as
my
example
daphne
alien
religious
drawings
have
the
graceful
charm
of
childhood
but
they
are
mere
childish
echoes
of
conventional
prettiness
her
talent
when
mature
will
turn
to
the
charming
rather
than
to
the
vigorous
there
could
be
no
greater
contrast
between
such
drawing
and
that
of
say
cimabue
cimabue
madonnas
are
not
pretty
women
but
huge
solemn
symbols
their
heads
droop
stiffly
their
tenderness
is
universal
in
gauguin
agony
in
the
garden
the
figure
of
christ
is
haggard
with
pain
and
grief
these
artists
have
filled
their
pictures
with
a
bitter
experience
which
no
child
can
possibly
possess
i
repeat
therefore
that
the
analogy
between
and
is
a
false
analogy
and
that
for
a
trained
man
or
woman
to
paint
as
a
child
paints
is
an
impossibility
footnote
i
am
well
aware
that
this
statement
is
at
variance
with
kandinsky
who
has
contributed
a
long
article
uber
die
formfrage
to
der
blaue
reiter
in
which
he
argues
the
parallel
between
and
child
vision
as
exemplified
in
the
work
of
henri
rousseau
certainly
rousseau
vision
is
childlike
he
has
had
no
artistic
training
and
pretends
to
none
but
i
consider
that
his
art
suffers
so
greatly
from
his
lack
of
training
that
beyond
a
sentimental
interest
it
has
little
to
recommend
it
all
this
does
not
presume
to
say
that
the
symbolist
school
of
art
is
necessarily
nobler
than
the
naturalist
i
am
making
no
comparison
only
a
distinction
when
the
difference
in
aim
is
fully
realized
the
primitives
can
no
longer
be
condemned
as
incompetent
nor
the
moderns
as
lunatics
for
such
a
condemnation
is
made
from
a
wrong
point
of
view
judgement
must
be
passed
not
on
the
failure
to
achieve
naturalism
but
on
the
failure
to
express
the
inner
meaning
the
brief
historical
survey
attempted
above
ended
with
the
names
of
cezanne
and
gauguin
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
introduction
for
the
purpose
that
is
to
say
of
tracing
the
genealogy
of
the
cubists
and
of
kandinsky
these
two
names
may
be
taken
to
represent
the
modern
expression
of
the
symbolist
tradition
the
difference
between
them
is
subtle
but
goes
very
deep
for
both
the
ultimate
and
internal
significance
of
what
they
painted
counted
for
more
than
the
significance
which
is
momentary
and
external
cezanne
saw
in
a
tree
a
heap
of
apples
a
human
face
a
group
of
bathing
men
or
women
something
more
abiding
than
either
photography
or
impressionist
painting
could
present
he
painted
the
treeness
of
the
tree
as
a
modern
critic
has
admirably
expressed
it
but
in
everything
he
did
he
showed
the
architectural
mind
of
the
true
frenchman
his
landscape
studies
were
based
on
a
profound
sense
of
the
structure
of
rocks
and
hills
and
being
structural
his
art
depends
essentially
on
reality
though
he
did
not
scruple
and
rightly
to
sacrifice
accuracy
of
form
to
the
inner
need
the
material
of
which
his
art
was
composed
was
drawn
from
the
huge
stores
of
actual
nature
gauguin
has
greater
solemnity
and
fire
than
cezanne
his
pictures
are
tragic
or
passionate
poems
he
also
sacrifices
conventional
form
to
inner
expression
but
his
art
tends
ever
towards
the
spiritual
towards
that
profounder
emphasis
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
natural
objects
nor
in
words
true
his
abandonment
of
representative
methods
did
not
lead
him
to
an
abandonment
of
natural
terms
of
expression
that
is
to
say
human
figures
trees
and
animals
do
appear
in
his
pictures
but
that
he
was
much
nearer
a
complete
rejection
of
representation
than
was
cezanne
is
shown
by
the
course
followed
by
their
respective
disciples
the
generation
immediately
subsequent
to
cezanne
herbin
vlaminck
friesz
marquet
do
little
more
than
exaggerate
cezanne
technique
until
there
appear
the
first
signs
of
cubism
these
are
seen
very
clearly
in
herbin
objects
begin
to
be
treated
in
flat
planes
a
round
vase
is
represented
by
a
series
of
planes
set
one
into
the
other
which
at
a
distance
blend
into
a
curve
this
is
the
first
stage
the
real
plunge
into
cubism
was
taken
by
picasso
who
nurtured
on
cezanne
carried
to
its
perfectly
logical
conclusion
the
master
structural
treatment
of
nature
representation
disappears
starting
from
a
single
natural
object
picasso
and
the
cubists
produce
lines
and
project
angles
till
their
canvases
are
covered
with
intricate
and
often
very
beautiful
series
of
balanced
lines
and
curves
they
persist
however
in
giving
them
picture
titles
which
recall
the
natural
object
from
which
their
minds
first
took
flight
with
gauguin
the
case
is
different
the
generation
of
his
disciples
which
followed
him
i
put
it
thus
to
distinguish
them
from
his
actual
pupils
at
pont
aven
serusier
and
the
rest
carried
the
tendency
further
one
hesitates
to
mention
derain
for
his
beginnings
full
of
vitality
and
promise
have
given
place
to
a
dreary
compromise
with
cubism
without
visible
future
and
above
all
without
humour
but
there
is
no
better
example
of
the
development
of
synthetic
symbolism
than
his
first
book
of
woodcuts

footnote
the
renaissance
of
the
angle
in
art
is
an
interesting
feature
of
the
new
movement
not
since
egyptian
times
has
it
been
used
with
such
noble
effect
there
is
a
painting
of
gauguin
at
hagen
of
a
row
of
tahitian
women
seated
on
a
bench
that
consists
entirely
of
a
telling
design
in
egyptian
angles
cubism
is
the
result
of
this
discovery
of
the
angle
blended
with
the
influence
of
cezanne
in
the
process
of
the
gradual
abandonment
of
natural
form
the
angle
school
is
paralleled
by
the
curve
school
which
also
descends
wholly
from
gauguin
the
best
known
representative
is
maurice
denis
but
he
has
become
a
slave
to
sentimentality
and
has
been
left
behind
matisse
is
the
most
prominent
french
artist
who
has
followed
gauguin
with
curves
in
germany
a
group
of
young
men
who
form
the
neue
kunstlevereinigung
in
munich
work
almost
entirely
in
sweeping
curves
and
have
reduced
natural
objects
purely
to
flowing
decorative
units
but
while
they
have
followed
gauguin
lead
in
abandoning
representation
both
of
these
two
groups
of
advance
are
lacking
in
spiritual
meaning
their
aim
becomes
more
and
more
decorative
with
an
undercurrent
of
suggestion
of
simplified
form
anyone
who
has
studied
gauguin
will
be
aware
of
the
intense
spiritual
value
of
his
work
the
man
is
a
preacher
and
a
psychologist
universal
by
his
very
unorthodoxy
fundamental
because
he
goes
deeper
than
civilization
in
his
disciples
this
great
element
is
wanting
kandinsky
has
supplied
the
need
he
is
not
only
on
the
track
of
an
art
more
purely
spiritual
than
was
conceived
even
by
gauguin
but
he
has
achieved
the
final
abandonment
of
all
representative
intention
in
this
way
he
combines
in
himself
the
spiritual
and
technical
tendencies
of
one
great
branch
of
the
question
most
generally
asked
about
kandinsky
art
is
what
is
he
trying
to
do
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
book
will
do
something
towards
answering
the
question
but
it
will
not
do
everything
this
partly
because
it
is
impossible
to
put
into
words
the
whole
of
kandinsky
ideal
partly
because
in
his
anxiety
to
state
his
case
to
court
criticism
the
author
has
been
tempted
to
formulate
more
than
is
wise
his
analysis
of
colours
and
their
effects
on
the
spectator
is
not
the
real
basis
of
his
art
because
if
it
were
one
could
with
the
help
of
a
scientific
manual
describe
one
emotions
before
his
pictures
with
perfect
accuracy
and
this
is
impossible
kandinsky
is
painting
music
that
is
to
say
he
has
broken
down
the
barrier
between
music
and
painting
and
has
isolated
the
pure
emotion
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
the
artistic
emotion
anyone
who
has
listened
to
good
music
with
any
enjoyment
will
admit
to
an
unmistakable
but
quite
indefinable
thrill
he
will
not
be
able
with
sincerity
to
say
that
such
a
passage
gave
him
such
visual
impressions
or
such
a
harmony
roused
in
him
such
emotions
the
effect
of
music
is
too
subtle
for
words
and
the
same
with
this
painting
of
kandinsky
speaking
for
myself
to
stand
in
front
of
some
of
his
drawings
or
pictures
gives
a
keener
and
more
spiritual
pleasure
than
any
other
kind
of
painting
but
i
could
not
express
in
the
least
what
gives
the
pleasure
presumably
the
lines
and
colours
have
the
same
effect
as
harmony
and
rhythm
in
music
have
on
the
truly
musical
that
psychology
comes
in
no
one
can
deny
many
people
perhaps
at
present
the
very
large
majority
of
people
have
their
sense
dormant
it
has
never
been
exercised
in
the
same
way
many
people
are
unmusical
either
wholly
by
nature
or
partly
for
lack
of
experience
even
when
kandinsky
idea
is
universally
understood
there
may
be
many
who
are
not
moved
by
his
melody
for
my
part
something
within
me
answered
to
kandinsky
art
the
first
time
i
met
with
it
there
was
no
question
of
looking
for
representation
a
harmony
had
been
set
up
and
that
was
enough
of
course
is
no
new
idea
that
is
to
say
attempts
have
been
made
to
play
compositions
in
colour
by
flashes
and
harmonies
footnote
cf
colour
music
by
wallace
rimington
hutchinson
net
also
music
has
been
interpreted
in
colour
but
i
do
not
know
of
any
previous
attempt
to
paint
without
any
reference
to
music
compositions
which
shall
have
on
the
spectator
an
effect
wholly
divorced
from
representative
association
kandinsky
refers
to
attempts
to
paint
in
but
that
is
a
different
matter
in
that
it
is
the
borrowing
from
one
art
by
another
of
purely
technical
methods
without
a
previous
impulse
from
spiritual
sympathy
one
is
faced
then
with
the
conflicting
claims
of
picasso
and
kandinsky
to
the
position
of
true
leader
of
art
picasso
admirers
hail
him
just
as
this
introduction
hails
kandinsky
as
a
visual
musician
the
methods
and
ideas
of
each
rival
are
so
different
that
the
title
can
not
be
accorded
to
both
in
his
book
kandinsky
states
his
opinion
of
cubism
and
its
fatal
weakness
and
history
goes
to
support
his
contention
the
origin
of
cubism
in
cezanne
in
a
structural
art
that
owes
its
very
existence
to
matter
makes
its
claim
to
pure
emotionalism
seem
untenable
emotions
are
not
composed
of
strata
and
conflicting
pressures
once
abandon
reality
and
the
geometrical
vision
becomes
abstract
mathematics
it
seems
to
me
that
picasso
shares
a
futurist
error
when
he
endeavours
to
harmonize
one
item
of
reality
a
number
a
button
a
few
capital
letters
with
a
surrounding
aura
of
angular
projections
there
must
be
a
conflict
of
impressions
which
differ
essentially
in
quality
one
trend
of
modern
music
is
towards
realism
of
sound
children
cry
dogs
bark
plates
are
broken
picasso
approaches
the
same
goal
from
the
opposite
direction
it
is
as
though
he
were
trying
to
work
from
realism
to
music
the
waste
of
time
is
to
my
mind
equally
complete
in
both
cases
the
power
of
music
to
give
expression
without
the
help
of
representation
is
its
noblest
possession
no
painting
has
ever
had
such
a
precious
power
kandinsky
is
striving
to
give
it
that
power
and
prove
what
is
at
least
the
logical
analogy
between
colour
and
sound
between
line
and
rhythm
of
beat
picasso
makes
little
use
of
colour
and
confines
himself
only
to
one
series
of
line
effects
those
caused
by
conflicting
angles
so
his
aim
is
smaller
and
more
limited
than
even
if
it
is
as
reasonable
but
because
it
has
not
wholly
abandoned
realism
but
uses
for
the
painting
of
feeling
a
structural
vision
dependent
for
its
value
on
the
association
of
reality
because
in
so
doing
it
tries
to
make
the
best
of
two
worlds
there
seems
little
hope
for
it
of
redemption
in
either
as
has
been
said
above
picasso
and
kandinsky
make
an
interesting
parallel
in
that
they
have
developed
the
art
respectively
of
cezanne
and
gauguin
in
a
similar
direction
on
the
decision
of
picasso
failure
or
success
rests
the
distinction
between
cezanne
and
gauguin
the
realist
and
the
symbolist
the
painter
of
externals
and
the
painter
of
religious
feeling
unless
a
spiritual
value
is
accorded
to
cezanne
work
unless
he
is
believed
to
be
a
religious
painter
and
religious
painters
need
not
paint
madonnas
unless
in
fact
he
is
paralleled
closely
with
gauguin
his
follower
picasso
can
not
claim
to
stand
with
kandinsky
as
a
prophet
of
an
art
of
spiritual
harmony
if
kandinsky
ever
attains
his
ideal
for
he
is
the
first
to
admit
that
he
has
not
yet
reached
his
goal
if
he
ever
succeeds
in
finding
a
common
language
of
colour
and
line
which
shall
stand
alone
as
the
language
of
sound
and
beat
stands
alone
without
recourse
to
natural
form
or
representation
he
will
on
all
hands
be
hailed
as
a
great
innovator
as
a
champion
of
the
freedom
of
art
until
such
time
it
is
the
duty
of
those
to
whom
his
work
has
spoken
to
bear
their
testimony
otherwise
he
may
be
condemned
as
one
who
has
invented
a
shorthand
of
his
own
and
who
paints
pictures
which
can
not
be
understood
by
those
who
have
not
the
key
of
the
cipher
in
the
meantime
also
it
is
important
that
his
position
should
be
recognized
as
a
legitimate
almost
inevitable
outcome
of
tendencies
such
is
the
recognition

dedicated

tichejeff
part
about
general
aesthetic
i
introduction
every
work
of
art
is
the
child
of
its
age
and
in
many
cases
the
mother
of
our
emotions
it
follows
that
each
period
of
culture
produces
an
art
of
its
own
which
can
never
be
repeated
efforts
to
revive
the
of
the
past
will
at
best
produce
an
art
that
is
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
live
and
feel
as
did
the
ancient
greeks
in
the
same
way
those
who
strive
to
follow
the
greek
methods
in
sculpture
achieve
only
a
similarity
of
form
the
work
remaining
soulless
for
all
time
such
imitation
is
mere
aping
externally
the
monkey
completely
resembles
a
human
being
he
will
sit
holding
a
book
in
front
of
his
nose
and
turn
over
the
pages
with
a
thoughtful
aspect
but
his
actions
have
for
him
no
real
meaning
there
is
however
in
art
another
kind
of
external
similarity
which
is
founded
on
a
fundamental
truth
when
there
is
a
similarity
of
inner
tendency
in
the
whole
moral
and
spiritual
atmosphere
a
similarity
of
ideals
at
first
closely
pursued
but
later
lost
to
sight
a
similarity
in
the
inner
feeling
of
any
one
period
to
that
of
another
the
logical
result
will
be
a
revival
of
the
external
forms
which
served
to
express
those
inner
feelings
in
an
earlier
age
an
example
of
this
today
is
our
sympathy
our
spiritual
relationship
with
the
primitives
like
ourselves
these
artists
sought
to
express
in
their
work
only
internal
truths
renouncing
in
consequence
all
consideration
of
external
form
this
spark
of
inner
life
today
is
at
present
only
a
spark
our
minds
which
are
even
now
only
just
awakening
after
years
of
materialism
are
infected
with
the
despair
of
unbelief
of
lack
of
purpose
and
ideal
the
nightmare
of
materialism
which
has
turned
the
life
of
the
universe
into
an
evil
useless
game
is
not
yet
past
it
holds
the
awakening
soul
still
in
its
grip
only
a
feeble
light
glimmers
like
a
tiny
star
in
a
vast
gulf
of
darkness
this
feeble
light
is
but
a
presentiment
and
the
soul
when
it
sees
it
trembles
in
doubt
whether
the
light
is
not
a
dream
and
the
gulf
of
darkness
reality
this
doubt
and
the
still
harsh
tyranny
of
the
materialistic
philosophy
divide
our
soul
sharply
from
that
of
the
primitives
our
soul
rings
cracked
when
we
seek
to
play
upon
it
as
does
a
costly
vase
long
buried
in
the
earth
which
is
found
to
have
a
flaw
when
it
is
dug
up
once
more
for
this
reason
the
primitive
phase
through
which
we
are
now
passing
with
its
temporary
similarity
of
form
can
only
be
of
short
duration
these
two
possible
resemblances
between
the
art
forms
of
today
and
those
of
the
past
will
be
at
once
recognized
as
diametrically
opposed
to
one
another
the
first
being
purely
external
has
no
future
the
second
being
internal
contains
the
seed
of
the
future
within
itself
after
the
period
of
materialist
effort
which
held
the
soul
in
check
until
it
was
shaken
off
as
evil
the
soul
is
emerging
purged
by
trials
and
sufferings
shapeless
emotions
such
as
fear
joy
grief
which
belonged
to
this
time
of
effort
will
no
longer
greatly
attract
the
artist
he
will
endeavour
to
awake
subtler
emotions
as
yet
unnamed
living
himself
a
complicated
and
comparatively
subtle
life
his
work
will
give
to
those
observers
capable
of
feeling
them
lofty
emotions
beyond
the
reach
of
words
the
observer
of
today
however
is
seldom
capable
of
feeling
such
emotions
he
seeks
in
a
work
of
art
a
mere
imitation
of
nature
which
can
serve
some
definite
purpose
for
example
a
portrait
in
the
ordinary
sense
or
a
presentment
of
nature
according
to
a
certain
convention
impressionist
painting
or
some
inner
feeling
expressed
in
terms
of
natural
form
as
we
say
a
picture
with
stimmung
footnote
stimmung
is
almost
untranslateable
it
is
almost
sentiment
in
the
best
sense
and
almost
feeling
many
of
corot
twilight
landscapes
are
full
of
a
beautiful
stimmung
kandinsky
uses
the
word
later
on
to
mean
the
essential
spirit
of
all
those
varieties
of
picture
when
they
are
really
art
fulfil
their
purpose
and
feed
the
spirit
though
this
applies
to
the
first
case
it
applies
more
strongly
to
the
third
where
the
spectator
does
feel
a
corresponding
thrill
in
himself
such
harmony
or
even
contrast
of
emotion
can
not
be
superficial
or
worthless
indeed
the
stimmung
of
a
picture
can
deepen
and
purify
that
of
the
spectator
such
works
of
art
at
least
preserve
the
soul
from
coarseness
they
key
it
up
so
to
speak
to
a
certain
height
as
a
the
strings
of
a
musical
instrument
but
purification
and
extension
in
duration
and
size
of
this
sympathy
of
soul
remain
and
the
possibilities
of
the
influence
of
art
are

hearts

the
duty
of

schumann
an
artist
is
a
man
who
can
draw
and
paint
everything
said
tolstoi
of
these
two
definitions
of
the
artist
activity
we
must
choose
the
second
if
we
think
of
the
exhibition
just
described
on
one
canvas
is
a
huddle
of
objects
painted
with
varying
degrees
of
skill
virtuosity
and
vigour
harshly
or
smoothly
to
harmonize
the
whole
is
the
task
of
art
with
cold
eyes
and
indifferent
mind
the
spectators
regard
the
work
connoisseurs
admire
the
skill
as
one
admires

tightrope
walker
enjoy
the
quality
of
painting
as
one
enjoys
a
pasty

hungry
souls
go
hungry
away
the
vulgar
herd

and
pronounce
the
pictures
nice
or
splendid
those
who
could
speak
have
said
nothing
those
who
could
hear
have
heard
nothing
this
condition
of
art
is
called
art
for
art
sake
this
neglect
of
inner
meanings
which
is
the
life
of
colours
this
vain
squandering
of
artistic
power
is
called
art
for
art
sake
the
artist
seeks
for
material
reward
for
his
dexterity
his
power
of
vision
and
experience
his
purpose
becomes
the
satisfaction
of
vanity
and
greed
in
place
of
the
steady
of
artists
is
a
scramble
for
good
things
there
are
complaints
of
excessive
competition
of
hatred
partisanship
cliques
jealousy
intrigues
are
the
natural
consequences
of
this
aimless
materialist
art
footnote
the
few
solitary
exceptions
do
not
destroy
the
truth
of
this
sad
and
ominous
picture
and
even
these
exceptions
are
chiefly
believers
in
the
doctrine
of
art
for
art
sake
they
serve
therefore
a
higher
ideal
but
one
which
is
ultimately
a
useless
waste
of
their
strength
external
beauty
is
one
element
of
a
spiritual
atmosphere
but
beyond
this
positive
fact
that
what
is
beautiful
is
good
it
has
the
weakness
of
a
talent
not
used
to
the
full
the
word
talent
is
employed
in
the

the
onlooker
turns
away
from
the
artist
who
has
higher
ideals
and
who
can
not
see
his

purpose
in
an
art
without
aims
sympathy
is
the
education
of
the
spectator
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
artist
it
has
been
said
above
that
art
is
the
child
of
its
age
such
an
art
can
only
create
an
artistic
feeling
which
is
already
clearly
felt
this
art
which
has
no
power
for
the
future
which
is
only
a
child
of
the
age
and
can
not
become
a
mother
of
the
future
is
a
barren
art
she
is
transitory
and
to
all
intent
dies
the
moment
the
atmosphere
alters
which
nourished
her
the
other
art
that
which
is
capable
of
educating
further
springs
equally
from
contemporary
feeling
but
is
at
the
same
time
not
only
echo
and
mirror
of
it
but
also
has
a
deep
and
powerful
prophetic
strength
the
spiritual
life
to
which
art
belongs
and
of
which
she
is
one
of
the
mightiest
elements
is
a
complicated
but
definite
and
easily
definable
movement
forwards
and
upwards
this
movement
is
the
movement
of
experience
it
may
take
different
forms
but
it
holds
at
bottom
to
the
same
inner
thought
and
purpose
veiled
in
obscurity
are
the
causes
of
this
need
to
move
ever
upwards
and
forwards
by
sweat
of
the
brow
through
sufferings
and
fears
when
one
stage
has
been
accomplished
and
many
evil
stones
cleared
from
the
road
some
unseen
and
wicked
hand
scatters
new
obstacles
in
the
way
so
that
the
path
often
seems
blocked
and
totally
obliterated
but
there
never
fails
to
come
to
the
rescue
some
human
being
like
ourselves
in
everything
except
that
he
has
in
him
a
secret
power
of
vision
he
sees
and
points
the
way
the
power
to
do
this
he
would
sometimes
fain
lay
aside
for
it
is
a
bitter
cross
to
bear
but
he
can
not
do
so
scorned
and
hated
he
drags
after
him
over
the
stones
the
heavy
chariot
of
a
divided
humanity
ever
forwards
and
upwards
often
many
years
after
his
body
has
vanished
from
the
earth
men
try
by
every
means
to
recreate
this
body
in
marble
iron
bronze
or
stone
on
an
enormous
scale
as
if
there
were
any
intrinsic
value
in
the
bodily
existence
of
such
divine
martyrs
and
servants
of
humanity
who
despised
the
flesh
and
lived
only
for
the
spirit
but
at
least
such
setting
up
of
marble
is
a
proof
that
a
great
number
of
men
have
reached
the
point
where
once

would

ii
the
movement
of
the

the
life
of
the

may
be
fairly
represented
in

a

the
narrowest

the

the

the

the
whole
triangle
is
moving
slowly
almost
invisibly
forwards
and
upwards
where
the
apex
was
today
the
second
segment
is
tomorrow
what
today
can
be
understood
only
by
the
apex
and
to
the
rest
of
the
triangle
is
an
incomprehensible
gibberish
forms
tomorrow
the
true
thought
and
feeling
of
the
second
segment
at
the
apex
of
the
top
segment
stands
often
one
man
and
only
one
his
joyful
vision
cloaks
a
vast
sorrow
even
those
who
are
nearest
to
him
in
sympathy
do
not
understand
him
angrily
they
abuse
him
as
charlatan
or
madman
so
in
his

and
insulted

the
idiot
how
many
years
will
it
be

a

of
the

the
spot
where

despite

each

who
can

the
limits
of
his
segment
is
a
prophet
to
those
about
him
and
helps
the
advance
of
the
obstinate
whole
but
those
who
are
blind
or
those
who
retard
the
movement
of
the
triangle
for
baser
reasons
are
fully
understood
by
their
fellows
and
acclaimed
for
their
genius
the
greater
the
segment
which
is
the

the

so
the

understand
the
words
of
the
artist

hungers
consciously
or
much
more

unconsciously
for

food
this
food
is
offered
by
the
artists
and
for
this
food

this
simile
of
the

can
not
be
said
to
express
every
aspect
of
the
spiritual
life
for
instance
there
is
never
an
absolute
to
the
picture
never
a
piece
of
unrelieved
gloom
even
too
often
it
happens
that
one
level
of
spiritual
food
suffices
for
the
nourishment
of
those
who
are
already
in
a
higher
segment
but
for
them
this
food
is
poison
in
small
quantities
it
depresses
their

it
hurls

sienkiewicz

the

a

talent
again
in
the
biblical
sense
becomes
a
curse
and
not

the
talent
of
the
artist
but
also
of
those
who
eat
this
poisoned
food
the

his

others
that
they

thirsty
and
that
from
this
pure
spring
they
may
quench
their
thirst
such
art
does
not
help
the
forward
movement
but
hinders
it
dragging
back
those
who
are
striving
to
press
onward
and
spreading

abroad
such
periods
during
which
art
has
no

champion
during
which
the
true
spiritual
food
is
wanting
are
periods
of
retrogression
in
the
spiritual
world
ceaselessly
souls
fall
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
segments
of
the
triangle
and
the
whole
seems
motionless
or
even
to
move
down
and
backwards
men
attribute
to
these
blind
and
dumb
periods
a
special
value
for
they
judge
them
by
outward
results
thinking
only
of
material
they
hail
some
technical
advance
which
can
help
nothing
but
the
body
as
a
great
achievement
real
spiritual
gains
are
at

at

entirely
ignored
the

visionaries
are

and
who
feel

longings
for
spiritual

and

cry
in
harsh
chorus
without
any
to
comfort
them
the
night
of
the

falls
more
and
more
darkly
deeper
becomes
the
misery
of
these
blind
and
terrified
guides
and
their

tormented

unnerved
by
fear
and

prefer
to
this
gradual
darkening
the
final
sudden
leap
into
the
blackness
at
such
a
time
art
ministers
to
lower
needs
and
is
used
for
material
ends
she
seeks
her
substance
in
hard
realities
because
she
knows
of
nothing
nobler
objects
the
reproduction
of
which
is
considered
her
sole
aim
remain
monotonously
the
same
the
question
what
disappears
from
art
only
the
question
how
remains
by
what
method
are
these
material
objects
to
be
reproduced
the
word
becomes
a
creed
art
has
lost
her
soul
in
the
search
for
method
the
artist
goes
still
further
art
becomes
so
specialized
as
to
be
comprehensible
only
to
artists
and
they
complain
bitterly
of
public
indifference
to
their
work
for
since
the
artist
in
such
times
has
no
need
to
say
much
but
only
to
be
notorious
for
some
small
originality
and
consequently
lauded
by
a
small
group
of
patrons
and
connoisseurs
which
incidentally
is
also
a
very
profitable
business
for
him
there
arise
a
crowd
of
gifted
and
skilful
painters
so
easy
does
the
conquest
of
art
appear
in
each
artistic
circle
are
thousands
of
such
artists
of
whom
the
majority
seek
only
for
some
new
technical
manner
and
who
produce
millions
of
works
of
art
without
enthusiasm
with
cold
hearts
and
souls
asleep
competition
arises
the
wild
battle
for
success
becomes
more
and
more
material
small
groups
who
have
fought
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
chaotic
world
of
art
and
entrench
themselves
in
the
territory
they
have
won
the
public

and

but
despite
all
this
confusion
this
chaos
this
wild
hunt
for

the

triangle
slowly
but
surely
with
irresistible
strength
moves
onwards
and
upwards
the
invisible

descends
from

sees

dance
round

calf
but
he
brings
with
him

to
man
first
by
the
artist
is
heard
his
voice
the
voice
that
is
inaudible
to
the
crowd
almost
unknowingly
the
artist
follows
the
call
already
in
that
very
question
how
lies
a
hidden
seed
of
renaissance
for
when
this
how
remains
without
any
fruitful
answer
there
is
always
a
possibility
that
the
same
something
which
we
call
personality
today
may
be
able
to
see
in
the
objects
about
it
not
only
what
is
purely
material
but
also
something
less
solid
something
less
bodily
than
was
seen
in
the
period
of
realism
when
the
universal
aim
was
to
reproduce
anything
as
it
really
is
and
without
fantastic
imagination
footnote
frequent
use
is
made
here
of
the
terms
material
and
and
of
the
intermediate
phrases
more
or
less
material
is
everything
material
or
is
everything
spiritual
can
the
distinctions
we
make
between
matter
and
spirit
be
nothing
but
relative
modifications
of
one
or
the
other
thought
which
although
a
product
of
the
spirit
can
be
defined
with
positive
science
is
matter
but
of
fine
and
not
coarse
substance
is
whatever
can
not
be
touched
with
the
hand
spiritual
the
discussion
lies
beyond
the
scope
of
this
little
book
all
that
matters
here
is
that
the
boundaries
drawn
should
not
be
too
definite
if
the
emotional
power
of
the
artist
can
overwhelm
the
how
and
can
give
free
scope
to
his
finer
feelings
then
art
is
on
the
crest
of
the
road
by
which
she
will
not
fail
later
on
to
find
the
what
she
has
lost
the
what
which
will
show
the
way
to
the
spiritual
food
of
the
newly
awakened
spiritual
life
this
what
will
no
longer
be
the
material
objective
what
of
the
former
period
but
the
internal
truth
of
art
the
soul
without
which
the
body
the
how
can
never
be
healthy
whether
in
an
individual
or
in
a
whole
people
this
what
is
the
internal
truth
which
only
art
can
divine
which
only
art
can
express
by
those
means
of
expression
which
are
hers
alone
iii
spiritual
revolution
the
spiritual
triangle
moves
slowly
onwards
and
upwards
today
one
of
the
largest
of
the
lower
segments
has
reached
the
point
of
using
the
first
battle
cry
of
the
materialist
creed
the
dwellers
in
this
segment
group
themselves
round
various
banners
in
religion
they
call
themselves
jews
catholics
protestants
etc
but
they
are
really
atheists
and
this
a
few
either
of
the
boldest
or
the
narrowest
openly
avow
heaven
is
empty
god
is
dead
in
politics
these
people
are
democrats
and
republicans
the
fear
horror
and
hatred
which
yesterday
they
felt
for
these
political
creeds
they
now
direct
against
anarchism
of
which
they
know
nothing
but
its
much
dreaded
name
in
economics
these
people
are
socialists
they
make
sharp
the
sword
of
justice
with
which
to
slay
the
hydra
of
capitalism
and
to
hew
off
the
head
of
evil
because
the
inhabitants
of
this
great
segment
of
the
triangle
have
never
solved
any
problem
independently
but
are
dragged
as
it
were
in
a
cart
by
those
the
noblest
of
their
fellowmen
who
have
sacrificed
themselves
they
know
nothing
of
the
vital
impulse
of
life
which
they
regard
always
vaguely
from
a
great
distance
they
rate
this
impulse
lightly
putting
their
trust
in
purposeless
theory
and
in
the
working
of
some
logical
method
the
men
of
the
segment
next
below
are
dragged
slowly
higher
blindly
by
those
just
described
but
they
cling
to
their
old
position
full
of
dread
of
the
unknown
and
of
betrayal
the
higher
segments
are
not
only
blind
atheists
but
can
justify
their
godlessness
with
strange
words
for
example
those
of
virchow
so
unworthy
of
a
learned
man
i
have
dissected
many
corpses
but
never
yet
discovered
a
soul
in
any
of
them
in
politics
they
are
generally
republican
with
a
knowledge
of
different
parliamentary
procedures
they
read
the
political
leading
articles
in
the
newspapers
in
economics
they
are
socialists
of
various
grades
and
can
support
their
principles
with
numerous
quotations
passing
from
schweitzer
emma
via
lasalle
iron
law
of
wages
to
marx
capital
and
still
further
in
these
loftier
segments
other
categories
of
ideas
absent
in
these
just
described
begin
gradually
to
appear
science
and
art
to
which
last
belong
also
literature
and
music
in
science
these
men
are
positivists
only
recognizing
those
things
that
can
be
weighed
and
measured
anything
beyond
that
they
consider
as
rather
discreditable
nonsense
that
same
nonsense
about
which
they
held
yesterday
the
theories
that
today
are
proven
in
art
they
are
naturalists
which
means
that
they
recognize
and
value
the
personality
individuality
and
temperament
of
the
artist
up
to
a
certain
definite
point
this
point
has
been
fixed
by
others
and
in
it
they
believe
unflinchingly
but
despite
their
patent
and
security
despite
their
infallible
principles
there
lurks
in
these
higher
segments
a
hidden
fear
a
nervous
trembling
a
sense
of
insecurity
and
this
is
due
to
their
upbringing
they
know
that
the
sages
statesmen
and
artists
whom
today
they
revere
were
yesterday
spurned
as
swindlers
and
charlatans
and
the
higher
the
segment
in
the
triangle
the
better
defined
is
this
fear
this
modern
sense
of
insecurity
here
and
there
are
people
with
eyes
which
can
see
minds
which
can
correlate
they
say
to
themselves
if
the
science
of
the
day
before
yesterday
is
rejected
by
the
people
of
yesterday
and
that
of
yesterday
by
us
of
today
is
it
not
possible
that
what
we
call
science
now
will
be
rejected
by
the
men
of
tomorrow
and
the
bravest
of
them
answer
it
is
possible
then
people
appear
who
can
distinguish
those
problems
that
the
science
of
today
has
not
yet
explained
and
they
ask
themselves
will
science
if
it
continues
on
the
road
it
has
followed
for
so
long
ever
attain
to
the
solution
of
these
problems
and
if
it
does
so
attain
will
men
be
able
to
rely
on
its
solution
in
these
segments
are
also
professional
men
of
learning
who
can
remember
the
time
when
facts
now
recognized
by
the
academies
as
firmly
established
were
scorned
by
those
same
academies
there
are
also
philosophers
of
aesthetic
who
write
profound
books
about
an
art
which
was
yesterday
condemned
as
nonsense
in
writing
these
books
they
remove
the
barriers
over
which
art
has
most
recently
stepped
and
set
up
new
ones
which
are
to
remain
for
ever
in
the
places
they
have
chosen
they
do
not
notice
that
they
are
busy
erecting
barriers
not
in
front
of
art
but
behind
it
and
if
they
do
notice
this
on
the
morrow
they
merely
write
fresh
books
and
hastily
set
their
barriers
a
little
further
on
this
performance
will
go
on
unaltered
until
it
is
realized
that
the
most
extreme
principle
of
aesthetic
can
never
be
of
value
to
the
future
but
only
to
the
past
no
such
theory
of
principle
can
be
laid
down
for
those
things
which
lie
beyond
in
the
realm
of
the
immaterial
that
which
has
no
material
existence
can
not
be
subjected
to
a
material
classification
that
which
belongs
to
the

gloomy
mountains

the
cries

when
one
of
maeterlinck
plays
was
produced
in
petersburg
under
his
own
guidance
he
himself
at
one
of
the
rehearsals
had
a
tower
represented
by
a
plain
piece
of
hanging
linen
it
was
of
no
importance
to
him
to
have

they

similar
lines
the
imagination
of
the
spectator
plays
in
the
modern
theatre
and
especially
in
that
of
russia
an
important
part
and
this
is
a
notable
element
in
the
transition
from
the
material
to
the
spiritual
in
the
theatre
of
the
future
maeterlinck
principal
technical
weapon
is
his
use
of
words
the
word
may
express
an
inner
harmony
this
inner
harmony
springs
partly
perhaps
principally
from
the
object
which
it
names
but
if
the
object
is
not
itself
seen
but
only
its
name
heard
the
mind
of
the
hearer
receives
an
abstract
impression
only
that
is
to
say
as
of
the
object
dematerialized
and
a
corresponding
vibration
is
immediately
set
up
in
the
heart
the
apt
use
of
a
word
in
its
poetical
meaning
repetition
of
this
word
twice
three
times
or
even
more
frequently
according
to
the
need
of
the
poem
will
not
only
tend
to
intensify
the
inner
harmony
but
also
bring
to
light
unsuspected
spiritual
properties
of
the
word
itself
further
than
that
frequent
repetition
of
a
word
again
a
favourite
game
of
children
which
is
forgotten
in
after
life
deprives
the
word
of
its
original
external
meaning
similarly
in
drawing
the
abstract
message
of
the
object
drawn
tends
to
be
forgotten
and
its
meaning
lost
sometimes
perhaps
we
unconsciously
hear
this
real
harmony
sounding
together
with
the
material
or
later
on
with
the
sense
of
the
object
but
in
the
latter
case
the
true
harmony
exercises
a
direct
impression
on
the
soul
the
soul
undergoes
an
emotion
which
has
no
relation
to
any
definite
object
an
emotion
more
complicated
i
might
say
more
than
the
emotion
caused
by
the
sound
of
a
bell
or
of
a
stringed
instrument
this
line
of
development
offers
great
possibilities
to
the
literature
of
the
future

subtle
value
even
a
familiar
word

used
in

way
can
intensify
an
atmosphere

a
comparison
between
the
work
of
poe
and
maeterlinck
shows
the
course
of
artistic
transition
from
the
material
to
the
abstract
an
the
word
which
has
two
meanings
the
first
direct
the
second
indirect
is
the
pure
material
of
poetry
and
of
literature
the
material
which
these
arts
alone
can
manipulate
and
through
which
they
speak
to
the
spirit
something
similar
may
be
noticed
in
the
music
of
wagner
his
famous
leitmotiv
is
an
attempt
to
give
personality
to
his
characters
by
something
beyond
theatrical
expedients
and
light
effect
his
method
of
using
a
definite
motiv
is
a
purely
musical
method
it
creates
a
spiritual
atmosphere
by
means
of
a
musical
phrase
which
precedes
the
hero
which
he
seems
to
radiate
forth
from
any
distance
footnote
frequent
attempts
have
shown
that
such
a
spiritual
atmosphere
can
belong
not
only
to
heroes
but
to
any
human
being
sensitives
can
not
for
example
remain
in
a
room
in
which
a
person
has
been
who
is
spiritually
antagonistic
to
them
even
though
they
know
nothing
of
his
existence
the
most
modern
musicians
like
debussy
create
a
spiritual
impression
often
taken
from
nature
but
embodied
in
purely
musical
form
for
this
reason
debussy
is
often
classed
with
the
impressionist
painters
on
the
ground
that
he
resembles
these
painters
in
using
natural
phenomena
for
the
purposes
of
his
art
whatever
truth
there
may
be
in
this
comparison
merely
accentuates
the
fact
that
the
various
arts
of
today
learn
from
each
other
and
often
resemble
each
other
but
it
would
be
rash
to
say
that
this
definition
is
an
exhaustive
statement
of
debussy
significance
despite
his
similarity
with
the
impressionists
this
musician
is
deeply
concerned
with
spiritual
harmony
for
in
his
works
one
hears
the
suffering
and
tortured
nerves
of
the
present
time
and
further
debussy
never
uses
the
wholly
material
note
so
characteristic
of
programme
music
but
trusts
mainly
in
the
creation
of
a
more
abstract
impression
debussy
has
been
greatly
influenced
by
russian
music
notably
by
mussorgsky
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
stands
in
close
relation
to
the
young
russian
composers
the
chief
of
whom
is
scriabin
the
experience
of
the
hearer
is
frequently
the
same
during
the
performance
of
the
works
of
these
two
musicians
he
is
often
snatched
quite
suddenly
from
a
series
of
modern
discords
into
the
charm
of
more
or
less
conventional
beauty
he
feels
himself
often
insulted
tossed
about
like
a
tennis
ball
over
the
net
between
the
two
parties
of
the
outer
and
the
inner
beauty
to
those
who
are
not
accustomed
to
it
the
inner
beauty
appears
as
ugliness
because
humanity
in
general
inclines
to
the
outer
and
knows
nothing
of
the
inner
almost
alone
in
severing
himself
from
conventional
beauty
is
the
austrian
composer
arnold
schonberg
he
says
in
his
harmonielehre
every
combination
of
notes
every
advance
is
possible
but
i
am
beginning
to
feel
that
there
are
also
definite
rules
and
conditions
which
incline
me
to
the
use
of
this
or
that
dissonance
footnote

means
that
schonberg

that
the
greatest
freedom
of

the
freedom
of
an
unfettered
art
can
never
be

freedom

the
measure

age

be

enlarged
schonberg

endeavouring
to
make
complete
use
of
his
freedom
and
has
already
discovered
gold
mines
of
new
beauty
in
his
search
for
spiritual
harmony
his
music
leads
us
into
a
realm
where
musical
experience
is
a
matter
not
of
the
ear
but
of
the
soul
alone
and
from
this
point
begins
the
music
of
the
future
a
parallel
course
has
been
followed
by
the
impressionist
movement
in
painting
it
is
seen
in
its
dogmatic
and
most
naturalistic
form
in
the
theory
of
this
is
to
put
on
the
canvas
the
whole
glitter
and
brilliance
of
nature
and
not
only
an
isolated
aspect
of
her
it
is
interesting
to
notice
three
practically
contemporary
and
totally
different
groups
in
painting
they
are
rossetti
and
his
pupil
with
their
followers
bocklin
and
his
school
segantini
with
his
unworthy
following
of
photographic
artists
i
have
chosen
these
three
groups
to
illustrate
the
search
for
the
abstract
in
art
rossetti
sought
to
revive
the
of
the
bocklin
busied
himself
with
the
mythological
scenes
but
was
in
contrast
to
rossetti
in
that
he
gave
strongly
material
form
to
his
legendary
figures
segantini
outwardly
the
most
material
of
the
three
selected
the
most
ordinary
objects
hills
stones
cattle
etc
often
painting
them
with
the
minutest
realism
but
he
never
failed
to
create
a
spiritual
as
well
as
a
material
value
so
that
really
he
is
the
most
of
the
trio
these
men
sought
for
the
inner
by
way
of
the
outer
by
another
road
and
one
more
purely
artistic
the
great
seeker
after
a
new
sense
of
form
approached
the
same
problem
cezanne
made
a
living
thing
out
of
a
teacup
or
rather
in
a
teacup
he
realized
the
existence
of
something
alive
he
raised
still
life
to
such
a
point
that
it
ceased
to
be
inanimate
he
painted
these
things
as
he
painted
human
beings
because
he
was
endowed
with
the
gift
of
divining
the
inner
life
in
everything
his
colour
and
form
are
alike
suitable
to
the
spiritual
harmony
a
man
a
tree
an
apple
all
were
used
by
cezanne
in
the
creation
of
something
that
is
called
a
picture
and
which
is
a
piece
of
true
inward
and
artistic
harmony
the
same
intention
actuates
the
work
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
young
frenchmen
henri
matisse

paints
pictures

in
these
pictures
endeavours
to
reproduce

whatever
it
may
be
and
then
the
methods
that
belong
to
painting
alone
colour
and
form
by
personal
inclination
because
he
is
french
and
because
he
is
specially
gifted
as
a
colourist
matisse
is
apt
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
colour
like
debussy
he
can
not
always
refrain
from
conventional
beauty
impressionism
is
in
his
blood
one
sees
pictures
of
matisse
which
are
full
of
great
inward
vitality
produced
by
the
stress
of
the
inner
need
and
also
pictures
which
possess
only
outer
charm
because
they
were
painted
on
an
outer
impulse
how
often
one
is
reminded
of
manet
in
this
his
work
seems
to
be
typical
french
painting
with
its
dainty
sense
of
melody
raised
from
time
to
time
to
the
summit
of
a
great
hill
above
the
clouds
but
in
the
work
of
another
great
artist
in
paris
the
spaniard
pablo
picasso
there
is
never
any
suspicion
of
this
conventional
beauty
tossed
hither
and
thither
by
the
need
for
picasso
hurries
from
one
manner
to
another
at
times
a
great
gulf
appears
between
consecutive
manners
because
picasso
leaps
boldly
and
is
found
continually
by
his
bewildered
crowd
of
followers
standing
at
a
point
very
different
from
that
at
which
they
saw
him
last
no
sooner
do
they
think
that
they
have
reached
him
again
than
he
has
changed
once
more
in
this
way
there
arose
cubism
the
latest
of
the
french
movements
which
is
treated
in
detail
in
part
ii
picasso
is
trying
to
arrive
at
constructiveness
by
way
of
proportion
in
his
latest
works
he
has
achieved
the
logical
destruction
of
matter
not
however
by
dissolution
but
rather
by
a
kind
of
a
parcelling
out
of
its
various
divisions
and
a
constructive
scattering
of
these
divisions
about
the
canvas
but
he
seems
in
this
most
recent
work
distinctly
desirous
of
keeping
an
appearance
of
matter
he
shrinks
from
no
innovation
and
if
colour
seems
likely
to
balk
him
in
his
search
for
a
pure
artistic
form
he
throws
it
overboard
and
paints
a
picture
in
brown
and
white
and
the
problem
of
purely
artistic
form
is
the
real
problem
of
his
life
in
their
pursuit
of
the
same
supreme
end
matisse
and
picasso
stand
side
by
side
matisse
representing
colour
and
picasso
form
iv
the
pyramid
and
so
at
different
points
along
the
road
are
the
different
arts
saying
what
they
are
best
able
to
say
and
in
the
language
which
is
peculiarly
their
own
despite
or
perhaps
thanks
to
the
differences
between
them
there
has
never
been
a
time
when
the
arts
approached
each
other
more
nearly
than
they
do
today
in
this
later
phase
of
spiritual
development
in
each
manifestation
is
the
seed
of
a
striving
towards
the
abstract
the
consciously
or
unconsciously
they
are
obeying
socrates
command
know
thyself
consciously
or
unconsciously
artists
are
studying
and
proving
their
material
setting
in
the
balance
the
spiritual
value
of
those
elements
with
which
it
is
their
several
privilege
to
work
and
the
natural
result
of
this
striving
is
that
the
various
arts
are
drawing
together
they
are
finding
in
music
the
best
teacher
with
few
exceptions
music
has
been
for
some
centuries
the
art
which
has
devoted
itself
not
to
the
reproduction
of
natural
phenomena
but
rather
to
the
expression
of
the
artist
soul
in
musical
sound
a
painter
who
finds
no
satisfaction
in
mere
representation
however
artistic
in
his
longing
to
express
his
inner
life
can
not
but
envy
the
ease
with
which
music
the
most
of
the
arts
today
achieves
this
end
he
naturally
seeks
to
apply
the
methods
of
music
to
his
own
art
and
from
this
results
that
modern
desire
for
rhythm
in
painting
for
mathematical
abstract
construction
for
repeated
notes
of
colour
for
setting
colour
in
motion
this
borrowing
of
method
by
one
art
from
another
can
only
be
truly
successful
when
the
application
of
the
borrowed
methods
is
not
superficial
but
fundamental
one
art
must
learn
first
how
another
uses
its
methods
so
that
the
methods
may
afterwards
be
applied
to
the
borrower
art
from
the
beginning
and
suitably
the
artist
must
not
forget
that
in
him
lies
the
power
of
true
application
of
every
method
but
that
that
power
must
be
developed
in
manipulation
of
form
music
can
achieve
results
which
are
beyond
the
reach
of
painting
on
the
other
hand
painting
is
ahead
of
music
in
several
particulars
music
for
example
has
at
its
disposal
duration
of
time
while
painting
can
present
to
the
spectator
the
whole
content
of
its
message
at
one
moment
footnote
these
statements
of
difference
are
of
course
relative
for
music
can
on
occasions
dispense
with
extension
of
time
and
painting
make
use
of
it
music
which
is
outwardly
unfettered
by
nature
needs
no
definite
form
for
its
expression
footnote
how
miserably
music
fails
when
attempting
to
express
material
appearances
is
proved
by
the
affected
absurdity
of
programme
music
quite
lately
such
experiments
have
been
made
the
imitation
in
sound
of
croaking
frogs
of
farmyard
noises
of
household
duties
makes
an
excellent
music
hall
turn
and
is
amusing
enough
but
in
serious
music
such
attempts
are
merely
warnings
against
any
imitation
of
nature
nature
has
her
own
language
and
a
powerful
one
this
language
can
not
be
imitated
the
sound
of
a
farmyard
in
music
is
never
successfully
reproduced
and
is
unnecessary
waste
of
time
the
stimmung
of
nature
can
be
imparted
by
every
art
not
however
by
imitation
but
by
the
artistic
divination
of
its
inner
spirit
painting
today
is
almost
exclusively
concerned
with
the
reproduction
of
natural
forms
and
phenomena
her
business
is
now
to
test
her
strength
and
methods
to
know
herself
as
music
has
done
for
a
long
time
and
then
to
use
her
powers
to
a
truly
artistic
end
and
so
the
arts
are
encroaching
one
upon
another
and
from
a
proper
use
of
this
encroachment
will
rise
the
art
that
is
truly
monumental
every
man
who
steeps
himself
in
the
spiritual
possibilities
of
his
art
is
a
valuable
helper
in
the
building
of
the
spiritual
pyramid
which
will
some
day
reach
to
heaven
part
ii
about
painting
the
psychological
working
of
colour
to
let
the
eye
stray
over
a
palette
splashed
with
many
colours
produces
a
dual
result
in
the
first
place
one
receives
a
purely
physical
impression
one
of
pleasure
and
contentment
at
the
varied
and
beautiful
colours
the
eye
is
either
warmed
or
else
soothed
and
cooled
but
these
physical
sensations
can
only
be
of
short
duration
they
are
merely
superficial
and
leave
no
lasting
impression
for
the
soul
is
unaffected
but
although
the
effect
of
the
colours
is
forgotten
when
the
eye
is
turned
away
the
superficial
impression
of
varied
colour
may
be
the
starting
point
of
a
whole
chain
of
related
sensations
on
the
average
man
only
the
impressions
caused
by
very
familiar
objects
will
be
purely
superficial
a
first
encounter
with
any
new
phenomenon
exercises
immediately
an
impression
on
the
soul
this
is
the
experience
of
the
child
discovering
the
world
to
whom
every
object
is
new
he
sees
a
light
wishes
to
take
hold
of
it
burns
his
finger
and
feels
henceforward
a
proper
respect
for
flame
but
later
he
learns
that
light
has
a
friendly
as
well
as
an
unfriendly
side
that
it
drives
away
the
darkness
makes
the
day
longer
is
essential
to
warmth
cooking
from
the
mass
of
these
discoveries
is
composed
a
knowledge
of
light
which
is
indelibly
fixed
in
his
mind
the
strong
intensive
interest
disappears
and
the
various
properties
of
flame
are
balanced
against
each
other
in
this
way
the
whole
world
becomes
gradually
disenchanted
it
is
realized
that
trees
give
shade
that
horses
run
fast
and
still
faster
that
dogs
bite
that
the
figure
seen
in
a
mirror
is
not
a
real
human
being
as
the
man
develops
the
circle
of
these
experiences
caused
by
different
beings
and
objects
grows
ever
wider
they
acquire
an
inner
meaning
and
eventually
a
spiritual
harmony
it
is
the
same
with
colour
which
makes
only
a
momentary
and
superficial
impression
on
a
soul
but
slightly
developed
in
sensitiveness
but
even
this
superficial
impression
varies
in
quality
the
eye
is
strongly
attracted
by
light
clear
colours
and
still
more
strongly
attracted
by
those
colours
which
are
warm
as
well
as
clear
vermilion
has
the
charm
of
flame
which
has
always
attracted
human
beings
keen
hurts
the
eye
in
time
as
a
prolonged
and
shrill
the
ear
and
the
gazer
turns
away
to
seek
relief
in
blue
or
green
but
to
a
more
sensitive
soul
the
effect
of
colours
is
deeper
and
intensely
moving
and
so
we
come
to
the
second
main
result
of
looking
at
colours
their
psychic
effect
they
produce
a
corresponding
spiritual
vibration
and
it
is
only
as
a
step
towards
this
spiritual
vibration
that
the
elementary
physical
impression
is
of
importance
whether
the
psychic
effect
of
colour
is
a
direct
one
as
these
last
few
lines
imply
or
whether
it
is
the
outcome
of
association
is
perhaps
open
to
question
the
soul
being
one
with
the
body
the
former
may
well
experience
a
psychic
shock
caused
by
association
acting
on
the
latter
for
example
red
may
cause
a
sensation
analogous
to
that
caused
by
flame
because
red
is
the
colour
of
flame
a
warm
red
will
prove
exciting
another
shade
of
red
will
cause
pain
or
disgust
through
association
with
running
blood
in
these
cases
colour
awakens
a
corresponding
physical
sensation
which
undoubtedly
works
upon
the
soul
if
this
were
always
the
case
it
would
be
easy
to
define
by
association
the
effects
of
colour
upon
other
senses
than
that
of
sight
one
might
say
that
keen
yellow
looks
sour
because
it
recalls
the
taste
of
a
lemon
but
such
definitions
are
not
universally
possible
there
are
many
examples
of
colour
working
which
refuse
to
be
so
classified
a
dresden
doctor
relates
of
one
of
his
patients
whom
he
designates
as
an
exceptionally
sensitive
person
that
he
could
not
eat
a
certain
sauce
without
tasting
blue
without
experiencing
a
feeling
of
seeing
a
blue
color

very
definite

on

one
is

question

that

can
exercise
enormous
influence
over
the
body
as
a
physical
organism
no
more
sufficient
in
the
psychic
sphere
is
the
theory
of
association
generally
speaking
colour
is
a
power
which
directly
influences
the
soul
colour
is
the
keyboard
the
eyes
are
the
hammers
the
soul
is
the

with
many
strings
the
artist
is
the
hand
which
plays
touching
one
key
or
another
to
cause
vibrations
in
the
soul
it
is
evident
therefore
that
colour
harmony
must
rest
only
on
a
corresponding
vibration
in
the
human
soul
and
this
is
one
of
the
guiding

impression
on
the
soul
and
produces
spiritual
harmony
i
say
indefinite
because
in
itself
it
has
no
suggestion
of
warmth
or
cold
such
attributes
having
to
be
imagined
for
it
afterwards
as
modifications
of
the
original
redness
i
say
definite
because
the
spiritual
harmony
exists
without
any
need
for
such
subsequent
attributes
of
warmth
or
cold
an
analogous
case
is
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
which
one
hears
when
the
word
trumpet
is
pronounced
this
sound
is
audible
to
the
soul
without
the
distinctive
character
of
a
trumpet
heard
in
the
open
air
or
in
a
room
played
alone
or
with
other
instruments
in
the
hands
of
a
postilion
a
huntsman
a
soldier
or
a
professional
musician
but
when
red
is
presented
in
a
material
form
as
in
painting
it
must
possess
some
definite
shade
of
the
many
shades
of
red
that
exist
and
a
limited
surface
divided
off
from
the
other
colours
which
are
undoubtedly
there
the
first
of
these
conditions
the
subjective
is
affected
by
the
second
the
objective
for
the
neighbouring
colours
affect
the
shade
of
red
this
essential
connection
between
colour
and
form
brings
us
to
the
question
of
the
influences
of
form
on
colour
form
alone
even
though
totally
abstract
and
geometrical
has
a
power
of
inner
suggestion
a
triangle
without
the
accessory
consideration
of
its
being
or
equilateral
has
a
spiritual
value
of
its
own
in
connection
with
other
forms
this
value
may
be
somewhat
modified
but
remains
in
quality
the
same
the
case
is
similar
with
a
circle
a
square
or
any
conceivable
geometrical
figure
footnote
the
angle
at
which
the
triangle
stands
and
whether
it
is
stationary
or
moving
are
of
importance
to
its
spiritual
value
this
fact
is
specially
worthy
of
the
painter
consideration
as
above
with
the
red
we
have
here
a
subjective
substance
in
an
objective
shell
the
mutual
influence
of
form
and
colour
now
becomes
clear
a
yellow
triangle
a
blue
circle
a
green
square
or
a
green
triangle
a
yellow
circle
a
blue
square
all
these
are
different
and
have
different
spiritual
values
it
is
evident
that
many
colours
are
hampered
and
even
nullified
in
effect
by
many
forms
on
the
whole
keen
colours
are
well
suited
by
sharp
forms
a
yellow
triangle
and
soft
deep
colours
by
round
forms
a
blue
circle
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
an
unsuitable
combination
of
form
and
colour
is
not
necessarily
discordant
but
may
with
manipulation
show
the
way
to
fresh
possibilities
of
harmony
since
colours
and
forms
are
innumerable
their
combination
and
their
influences
are
likewise
unending
the
material
is
inexhaustible
form
in
the
narrow
sense
is
nothing
but
the
separating
line
between
surfaces
of
colour
that
is
its
outer
meaning
but
it
has
also
an
inner
meaning
of
varying
intensity
footnote
it
is
never
literally
true
that
any
form
is
meaningless
and
says
nothing
every
form
in
the
world
says
something
but
its
message
often
fails
to
reach
us
and
even
if
it
does
full
understanding
is
often
withheld
from
us
and
properly
speaking
form
is
the
outward
expression
of
this
inner
meaning
to
use
once
more
the
metaphor
of
the
piano
the
artist
is
the
hand
which
by
playing
on
this
or
that
key
form
affects
the
human
soul
in
this
or
that
way
so
it
is
evident
that
must
rest
only
on
a
corresponding
vibration
of
the
human
soul
and
this
is
a
second
guiding
principle
of
the
inner
need
the
two
aspects
of
form
just
mentioned
define
its
two
aims
the
task
of
limiting
surfaces
the
outer
aspect
is
well
performed
if
the
inner
meaning
is
fully
expressed
footnote
the
phrase
full
expression
must
be
clearly
understood
form
often
is
most
expressive
when
least
coherent
it
is
often
most
expressive
when
outwardly
most
imperfect
perhaps
only
a
stroke
a
mere
hint
of
outer
meaning
the
outer
task
may
assume
many
different
shapes
but
it
will
never
fail
in
one
of
two
purposes
either
form
aims
at
so
limiting
surfaces
as
to
fashion
of
them
some
material
object
or
form
remains
abstract
describing
only
a
spiritual
entity
such
entities
with
life
and
value
as
such
are
a
circle
a
triangle
a
rhombus
a
trapeze
many
of
them
so
complicated
as
to
have
no
mathematical
denomination
between
these
two
extremes
lie
the
innumerable
forms
in
which
both
elements
exist
with
a
preponderance
either
of
the
abstract
or
the
material
these
intermediate
forms
are
at
present
the
store
on
which
the
artist
has
to
draw
purely
abstract
forms
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
artist
at
present
they
are
too
indefinite
for
him
to
limit
himself
to
the
purely
indefinite
would
be
to
rob
himself
of
possibilities
to
exclude
the
human
element
and
therefore
to
weaken
his
power
of
expression
on
the
other
hand
there
exists
equally
no
purely
material
form
a
material
object
can
not
be
absolutely
reproduced
for
good
or
evil
the
artist
has
eyes
and
hands
which
are
perhaps
more
artistic
than
his
intentions
and
refuse
to
aim
at
photography
alone
many
genuine
artists
who
can
not
be
content
with
a
mere
inventory
of
material
objects
seek
to
express
the
objects
by
what
was
once
called
idealization
then
selection
and
which
tomorrow
will
again
be
called
something
different
footnote
the
motive
of
idealization
is
so
to
beautify
the
organic
form
as
to
bring
out
its
harmony
and
rouse
poetic
feeling
selection
aims
not
so
much
at
beautification
as
at
emphasizing
the
character
of
the
object
by
the
omission
of
the
desire
of
the
future
will
be
purely
the
expression
of
the
inner
meaning
the
organic
form
no
longer
serves
as
direct
object
but
as
the
human
words
in
which
a
divine
message
must
be
written
in
order
for
it
to
be
comprehensible
to
human
minds
the
impossibility
and
in
art
the
uselessness
of
attempting
to
copy
an
object
exactly
the
desire
to
give
the
object
full
expression
are
the
impulses
which
drive
the
artist
away
from
literal
colouring
to
purely
artistic
aims
and
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
composition
footnote
here
kandinsky
means
arrangement
of
the
pure
artistic
composition
has
two
elements
the
composition
of
the
whole
picture
the
creation
of
the
various
forms
which
by
standing
in
different
relationships
to
each
other
decide
the
composition
of
the
whole
footnote
the
general
composition
will
naturally
include
many
little
compositions
which
may
be
antagonistic
to
each
other
though
helping
perhaps
by
their
very
antagonism
the
harmony
of
the
whole
these
little
compositions
have
themselves
subdivisions
of
varied
inner
meanings
many
objects
have
to
be
considered
in
the
light
of
the
whole
and
so
ordered
as
to
suit
this
whole
singly
they
will
have
little
meaning
being
of
importance
only
in
so
far
as
they
help
the
general
effect
these
single
objects
must
be
fashioned
in
one
way
only
and
this
not
because
their
own
inner
meaning
demands
that
particular
fashioning
but
entirely
because
they
have
to
serve
as
building
material
for
the
whole
composition
footnote
a
good
example
is
cezanne
bathing
women
which
is
built
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
such
building
is
an
old
principle
which
was
being
abandoned
only
because
academic
usage
had
made
it
lifeless
but
cezanne
has
given
it
new
life
he
does
not
use
it
to
harmonize
his
groups
but
for
purely
artistic
purposes
he
distorts
the
human
figure
with
perfect
justification
not
only
must
the
whole
figure
follow
the
lines
of
the
triangle
but
each
limb
must
grow
narrower
from
bottom
to
top
raphael
holy
family
is
an
example
of
triangular
composition
used
only
for
the
harmonizing
of
the
group
and
without
any
mystical
motive
so
the
abstract
idea
is
creeping
into
art
although
only
yesterday
it
was
scorned
and
obscured
by
purely
material
ideals
its
gradual
advance
is
natural
enough
for
in
proportion
as
the
organic
form
falls
into
the
background
the
abstract
ideal
achieves
greater
prominence
but
the
organic
form
possesses
all
the
same
an
inner
harmony
of
its
own
which
may
be
either
the
same
as
that
of
its
abstract
parallel
thus
producing
a
simple
combination
of
the
two
elements
or
totally
different
in
which
case
the
combination
may
be
unavoidably
discordant
however
diminished
in
importance
the
organic
form
may
be
its
inner
note
will
always
be
heard
and
for
this
reason
the
choice
of
material
objects
is
an
important
one
the
spiritual
accord
of
the
organic
with
the
abstract
element
may
strengthen
the
appeal
of
the
latter
as
much
by
contrast
as
by
similarity
or
may
destroy
it
suppose
a
rhomboidal
composition
made
up
of
a
number
of
human
figures
the
artist
asks
himself
are
these
human
figures
an
absolute
necessity
to
the
composition
or
should
they
be
replaced
by
other
forms
and
that
without
affecting
the
fundamental
harmony
of
the
whole
if
the
answer
is
yes
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
material
appeal
directly
weakens
the
abstract
appeal
the
human
form
must
either
be
replaced
by
another
object
which
whether
by
similarity
or
contrast
will
strengthen
the
abstract
appeal
or
must
remain
a
purely
symbol

and
once
more
the
metaphor
of
the
piano
for
colour
or
form
substitute
object
every
object
has
its
own
life
and
therefore
its
own
appeal
man
is
continually
subject
to
these
appeals
but
the
results
are
often
dubbed
either
sub
or
nature
that
is
to
say
the
surroundings
of
man
sets
in
vibration
the
strings
of
the
piano
the
soul
by
manipulation
of
the
keys
the
various
objects
with
their
several
appeals
the
impressions
we
receive
which
often
appear
merely
chaotic
consist
of
three
elements
the
impression
of
the
colour
of
the
object
of
its
form
and
of
its
combined
colour
and
form
of
the
object
itself
at
this
point
the
individuality
of
the
artist
comes
to
the
front
and
disposes
as
he
wills
these
three
elements
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
choice
of
object
of
one
of
the
elements
in
the
harmony
of
form
must
be
decided
only
by
a
corresponding
vibration
in
the
human
soul
and
this
is
a
third
guiding
principle
of
the
inner
need
the
more
abstract
is
form
the
more
clear
and
direct
is
its
appeal
in
any
composition
the
material
side
may
be
more
or
less
omitted
in
proportion
as
the
forms
used
are
more
or
less
material
and
for
them
substituted
pure
abstractions
or
largely
dematerialized
objects
the
more
an
artist
uses
these
abstracted
forms
the
deeper
and
more
confidently
will
he
advance
into
the
kingdom
of
the
abstract
and
after
him
will
follow
the
gazer
at
his
pictures
who
also
will
have
gradually
acquired
a
greater
familiarity
with
the
language
of
that
kingdom
must
we
then
abandon
utterly
all
material
objects
and
paint
solely
in
abstractions
the
problem
of
harmonizing
the
appeal
of
the
material
and
the
shows
us
the
answer
to
this
question
as
every
word
spoken
rouses
an
inner
vibration
so
likewise
does
every
object
represented
to
deprive
oneself
of
this
possibility
is
to
limit
one
powers
of
expression
that
is
at
any
rate
the
case
at
present
but
besides
this
answer
to
the
question
there
is
another
and
one
which
art
can
always
employ
to
any
question
beginning
with
must
there
is
no
must
in
art
because
art
is
free
with
regard
to
the
second
problem
of
composition
the
creation
of
the
single
elements
which
are
to
compose
the
whole
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
same
form
in
the
same
circumstances
will
always
have
the
same
inner
appeal
only
the
circumstances
are
constantly
varying
it
results
that
the
ideal
harmony
alters
according
to
the
relation
to
other
forms
of
the
form
which
causes
it
even
in
similar
relationship
a
slight
approach
to
or
withdrawal
from
other
forms
may
affect
the
harmony
footnote
this
is
what
is
meant
by
an
appeal
of
motion
for
example
the
appeal
of
an
upright
triangle
is
more
steadfast
and
quiet
than
that
of
one
set
obliquely
on
its
side
nothing
is
absolute
rests
on
a
relative
basis
depending
on
the
alterations
in
the
mutual
relations
of
forms
one
to
another
alterations
in
each
individual
form
down
to
the
very
smallest
every
form
is
as
sensitive
as
a
puff
of
smoke
the
slightest
breath
will
alter
it
completely
this
extreme
mobility
makes
it
easier
to
obtain
similar
harmonies
from
the
use
of
different
forms
than
from
a
repetition
of
the
same
one
though
of
course
an
exact
replica
of
a
spiritual
harmony
can
never
be
produced
so
long
as
we
are
susceptible
only
to
the
appeal
of
a
whole
composition
this
fact
is
of
mainly
theoretical
importance
but
when
we
become
more
sensitive
by
a
constant
use
of
abstract
forms
which
have
no
material
interpretation
it
will
become
of
great
practical
significance
and
so
as
art
becomes
more
difficult
its
wealth
of
expression
in
form
becomes
greater
and
greater
at
the
same
time
the
question
of
distortion
in
drawing
falls
out
and
is
replaced
by
the
question
how
far
the
inner
appeal
of
the
particular
form
is
veiled
or
given
full
expression
and
once
more
the
possibilities
are
extended
for
combinations
of
veiled
and
fully
expressed
appeals
suggest
new
leitmotiven
in
composition
without
such
development
as
this
is
impossible
to
anyone
who
can
not
experience
the
inner
appeal
of
form
whether
material
or
abstract
such
composition
can
never
be
other
than
meaningless
apparently
aimless
alterations
in
will
make
art
seem
merely
a
game
so
once
more
we
are
faced
with
the
same
principle
which
is
to
set
art
free
the
principle
of
the
inner
need
when
features
or
limbs
for
artistic
reasons
are
changed
or
distorted
men
reject
the
artistic
problem
and
fall
back
on
the
secondary
question
of
anatomy
but
on
our
argument
this
secondary
consideration
does
not
appear
only
the
real
artistic
question
remaining
these
apparently
irresponsible
but
really
alterations
in
form
provide
one
of
the
storehouses
of
artistic
possibilities
the
adaptability
of
forms
their
organic
but
inward
variations
their
motion
in
the
picture
their
inclination
to
material
or
abstract
their
mutual
relations
either
individually
or
as
parts
of
a
whole
further
the
concord
or
discord
of
the
various
elements
of
a
picture
the
handling
of
groups
the
combinations
of
veiled
and
openly
expressed
appeals
the
use
of
rhythmical
or
unrhythmical
of
geometrical
or
forms
their
contiguity
or
separation
all
these
things
are
the
material
for
counterpoint
in
painting
but
so
long
as
colour
is
excluded
such
counterpoint
is
confined
to
black
and
white
colour
provides
a
whole
wealth
of
possibilities
of
her
own
and
when
combined
with
form
yet
a
further
series
of
possibilities
and
all
these
will
be
expressions
of
the
inner
need
the
inner
need
is
built
up
of
three
mystical
elements
every
artist
as
a
creator
has
something
in
him
which
calls
for
expression
this
is
the
element
of
personality
every
artist
as
child
of
his
age
is
impelled
to
express
the
spirit
of
his
age
this
is
the
element
of
style
dictated
by
the
period
and
particular
country
to
which
the
artist
belongs
it
is
doubtful
how
long
the
latter
distinction
will
continue
to
exist
every
artist
as
a
servant
of
art
has
to
help
the
cause
of
art
this
is
the
element
of
pure
artistry
which
is
constant
in
all
ages
and
among
all
nationalities
a
full
understanding
of
the
first
two
elements
is
necessary
for
a
realization
of
the
third
but
he
who
has
this
realization
will
recognize
that
a
rudely
carved
indian
column
is
an
expression
of
the
same
spirit
as
actuates
any
real
work
of
art
of
today
in
the
past
and
even
today
much
talk
is
heard
of
personality
in
art
talk
of
the
coming
style
becomes
more
frequent
daily
but
for
all
their
importance
today
these
questions
will
have
disappeared
after
a
few
hundred
or
thousand
years
only
the
third
element
that
of
pure
artistry
will
remain
for
ever
an
egyptian
carving
speaks
to
us
today
more
subtly
than
it
did
to
its
chronological
contemporaries
for
they
judged
it
with
the
hampering
knowledge
of
period
and
personality
but
we
can
judge
purely
as
an
expression
of
the
eternal
artistry
similarly
the
greater
the
part
played
in
a
modern
work
of
art
by
the
two
elements
of
style
and
personality
the
better
will
it
be
appreciated
by
people
today
but
a
modern
work
of
art
which
is
full
of
the
third
element
will
fail
to
reach
the
contemporary
soul
for
many
centuries
have
to
pass
away
before
the
third
element
can
be
received
with
understanding
but
the
artist
in
whose
work
this
third
element
predominates
is
the
really
great
artist
because
the
elements
of
style
and
personality
make
up
what
is
called
the
periodic
characteristics
of
any
work
of
art
the
development
of
artistic
forms
must
depend
on
their
separation
from
the
element
of
pure
artistry
which
knows
neither
period
nor
nationality
but
as
style
and
personality
create
in
every
epoch
certain
definite
forms
which
for
all
their
superficial
differences
are
really
closely
related
these
forms
can
be
spoken
of
as
one
side
of
art
the
subjective
every
artist
chooses
from
the
forms
which
reflect
his
own
time
those
which
are
sympathetic
to
him
and
expresses
himself
through
them
so
the
subjective
element
is
the
definite
and
external
expression
of
the
inner
objective
element
the
inevitable
desire
for
outward
expression
of
the
objective
element
is
the
impulse
here
defined
as
the
inner
need
the
forms
it
borrows
change
from
day
to
day
and
as
it
continually
advances
what
is
today
a
phrase
of
inner
harmony
becomes
tomorrow
one
of
outer
harmony
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
inner
spirit
of
art
only
uses
the
outer
form
of
any
particular
period
as
a
to
further
expression
in
short
the
working
of
the
inner
need
and
the
development
of
art
is
an
expression
of
the
eternal
and
objective
in
the
terms
of
the
periodic
and
subjective
because
the
objective
is
forever
exchanging
the
subjective
expression
of
today
for
that
of
tomorrow
each
new
extension
of
liberty
in
the
use
of
outer
form
is
hailed
as
the
last
and
supreme
at
present
we
say
that
an
artist
can
use
any
form
he
wishes
so
long
as
he
remains
in
touch
with
nature
but
this
limitation
like
all
its
predecessors
is
only
temporary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
inner
need
no
limitation
must
be
made
the
artist
may
use
any
form
which
his
expression
demands
for
his
inner
impulse
must
find
suitable
outward
expression
so
we
see
that
a
deliberate
search
for
personality
and
style
is
not
only
impossible
but
comparatively
unimportant
the
close
relationship
of
art
throughout
the
ages
is
not
a
relationship
in
outward
form
but
in
inner
meaning
and
therefore
the
talk
of
schools
of
lines
of
development
of
principles
of
art
is
based
on
misunderstanding
and
can
only
lead
to
confusion
the
artist
must
be
blind
to
distinctions
between
recognized
or
unrecognized
conventions
of
form
deaf
to
the
transitory
teaching
and
demands
of
his
particular
age
he
must
watch
only
the
trend
of
the
inner
need
and
hearken
to
its
words
alone
then
he
will
with
safety
employ
means
both
sanctioned
and
forbidden
by
his
contemporaries
all
means
are
sacred
which
are
called
for
by
the
inner
need
all
means
are
sinful
which
obscure
that
inner
need
it
is
impossible
to
theorize
about
this
ideal
of
art
in
real
art
theory
does
not
precede
practice
but
follows
her
everything
is
at
first
a
matter
of
feeling
any
theoretical
scheme
will
be
lacking
in
the
essential
of
creation
the
inner
desire
for
expression
which
can
not
be
determined
neither
the
quality
of
the
inner
need
nor
its
subjective
form
can
be
measured
nor
weighed

the
term

here
used
must
not

the
term
material
used
previously
i
am
using
the
former
to
mean
outer

which
never
goes
beyond
conventional
limits
nor
produces

than
conventional

the

knows
no
such

itself
is
a
conventional

applied
to
some
expression

need
either
outgrown
or

everything
which
adequately
expresses
the
inner

is
beautiful

the
body
can
be
strengthened
and
developed
by
frequent
exercise
just
as
the
body
if
neglected
grows
weaker
and
finally
impotent
so
the
spirit
perishes
if
untended
and
for
this
reason
it
is
necessary
for
the
artist
to
know
the
starting
point
for
the
exercise
of
his
spirit
the
starting
point
is
the
study
of
colour
and
its
effects
on
men
there
is
no
need
to
engage
in
the
finer
shades
of
complicated
colour
but
rather
at
first
to
consider
only
the
direct
use
of
simple
colours
to
begin
with
let
us
test
the
working
on
ourselves
of
individual
colours
and
so
make
a
simple
chart
which
will
facilitate
the
consideration
of
the
whole
question
two
great
divisions
of
colour
occur
to
the
mind
at
the
outset
into
warm
and
cold
and
into
light
and
dark
to
each
colour
there
are
therefore
four
shades
of
appeal
warm
and
light
or
warm
and
dark
or
cold
and
light
or
cold
and
dark
generally
speaking
warmth
or
cold
in
a
colour
means
an
approach
respectively
to
yellow
or
to
blue
this
distinction
is
so
to
speak
on
one
basis
the
colour
having
a
constant
fundamental
appeal
but
assuming
either
a
more
material
or
more
quality
the
movement
is
an
horizontal
one
the
warm
colours
approaching
the
spectator
the
cold
ones
retreating
from
him
the
colours
which
cause
in
another
colour
this
horizontal
movement
while
they
are
themselves
affected
by
it
have
another
movement
of
their
own
which
acts
with
a
violent
separative
force
this
is
therefore
the
first
antithesis
in
the
inner
appeal
and
the
inclination
of
the
colour
to
yellow
or
to
blue
is
of
tremendous
importance
the
second
antithesis
is
between
white
and
black
the
inclination
to
light
or
dark
caused
by
the
pair
of
colours
just
mentioned
these
colours
have
once
more
their
peculiar
movement

and

on
the
other
hand
moves

retreating
into

footnote
these
statements
have
no
scientific
basis
but
are
founded
purely
on
spiritual
experience
in
the
case
of
light
and
dark
colours
the
movement
is
emphasized
that
of
the
yellow
increases
with
an
admixture
of
white
as
it
becomes
lighter
that
of
the
blue
increases
with
an
admixture
of
black
as
it
becomes
darker
this
means
that
there
can
never
be
a
yellow
the
relationship
between
white
and
yellow
is
as
close
as
between
black
and
blue
for
blue
can
be
so
dark
as
to
border
on
black
besides
this
physical
relationship
is
also
a
spiritual
one
between
yellow
and
white
on
one
side
between
blue
and
black
on
the
other
which
marks
a
strong
separation
between
the
two
pairs
an
attempt
to
make
yellow
colder
produces
a
green
tint
and
checks
both
the
horizontal
and
excentric
movement
the
colour
becomes
sickly
and
unreal
the
blue
by
its
contrary
movement
acts
as
a
brake
on
the
yellow
and
is
hindered
in
its
own
movement
till
the
two
together
become
stationary
and
the
result
is
green
similarly
a
mixture
of
black
and
white
produces
gray
which
is
motionless
and
spiritually
very
similar
to
green
but
while
green
yellow
and
blue
are
potentially
active
though
temporarily
paralysed
in
gray
there
is
no
possibility
of
movement
because
gray
consists
of
two
colours
that
have
no
active
force
for
they
stand
the
one
in
motionless
discord
the
other
in
a
motionless
negation
even
of
discord
like
an
endless
wall
or
a
bottomless
pit
because
the
component
colours
of
green
are
active
and
have
a
movement
of
their
own
it
is
possible
on
the
basis
of
this
movement
to
reckon
their
spiritual
appeal
the
first
movement
of
yellow
that
of
approach
to
the
spectator
which
can
be
increased
by
an
intensification
of
the
yellow
and
also
the
second
movement
that
of
the
boundaries
have
a
material
parallel
in
the
human
energy
which
assails
every
obstacle
blindly
and
bursts
forth
aimlessly
in
every
direction
yellow
if
steadily
gazed
at
in
any
geometrical
form
has
a
disturbing
influence
and
reveals
in
the
colour
an
insistent
aggressive
character
footnote
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
lemon
and
canary
are
both
yellow
the
intensification
of
the
yellow
increases
the
painful
shrillness
of
its
note
footnote
any
parallel
between
colour
and
music
can
only
be
relative
just
as
a
violin
can
give
various
shades
of
tone
so
yellow
has
shades
which
can
be
expressed
by
various
instruments
but
in
making
such
parallels
i
am
assuming
in
each
case
a
pure
tone
of
colour
or
sound
unvaried
by
vibration
or
dampers
etc
yellow
is
the
typically
earthly
colour
it
can
never
have
profound
meaning
an
intermixture
of
blue
makes
it
a
sickly
colour
it
may
be
paralleled
in
human
nature
with
madness
not
with
melancholy
or
hypochondriacal
mania
but
rather
with
violent
raving
lunacy
the
power
of
profound
meaning
is
found
in
blue
and
first
in
its
physical
movements
of
retreat
from
the
spectator
of
turning
in
upon
its
own
centre
the
inclination
of
blue
to
depth
is
so
strong

a
feeling
of
strength

determination
triumph
in

it
is

trumpets
strong
harsh
and
ringing
vermilion
is
a
red
with
a
feeling
of
sharpness
like
glowing
steel
which
can
be
cooled
by
water
vermilion
is
quenched
by
blue
for
it
can
support
no
mixture
with
a
cold
colour
more
accurately
speaking
such
a
mixture
produces
what
is
called
a
dirty
colour
scorned
by
painters
of
today
but
dirt
as
a
material
object
has
its
own
inner
appeal
and
therefore
to
avoid
it
in
painting
is
as
unjust
and
narrow
as
was
the
cry
of
yesterday
for
pure
colour
at
the
call
of
the
inner
need
that
which
is
outwardly
foul
may
be
inwardly
pure
and
vice
versa
the
two
shades
of
red
just
discussed
are
similar
to
yellow
except
that
they
reach
out
less
to
the
spectator
the
glow
of
red
is
within
itself
for
this
reason
it
is
a
colour
more
beloved
than
yellow
being
frequently
used
in
primitive
and
traditional
decoration
and
also
in
peasant
costumes
because
in
the
open
air
the
harmony
of
red
and
green
is
very
beautiful
taken
by
itself
this
red
is
material
and
like
yellow
has
no
very
deep
appeal
only
when
combined
with
something
nobler
does
it
acquire
this
deep
appeal
it
is
dangerous
to
seek
to
deepen
red
by
an
admixture
of
black
for
black
quenches
the
glow
or
at
least
reduces
it
considerably
but
there
remains
brown
unemotional
disinclined
for
movement
an
intermixture
of
red
is
outwardly
barely
audible
but
there
rings
out
a
powerful
inner
harmony
skillful
blending
can
produce
an
inner
appeal
of
extraordinary
indescribable
beauty
the
vermilion
now
rings
like
a
great
trumpet
or
thunders
like
a
drum
cool
red
madder
like
any
other
fundamentally
cold
colour
can
be
deepened
especially
by
an
intermixture
of
azure
the
character
of
the
colour
changes
the
inward
glow
increases
the
active
element
gradually
disappears
but
this
active
element
is
never
so
wholly
absent
as
in
deep
green
there
always
remains
a
hint
of
renewed
vigour
somewhere
out
of
sight
waiting
for
a
certain
moment
to
burst
forth
afresh
in
this
lies
the
great
difference
between
a
deepened
red
and
a
deepened
blue
because
in
red
there
is
always
a
trace
of
the
material
a
parallel
in
music
are
the
sad
middle
tones
of
a
cello
a
cold
light
red
contains
a
very
distinct
bodily
or
material
element
but
it
is
always
pure
like
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
face
of
a
young
girl
the
singing
notes
of
a
violin
express
this
exactly
in
music
warm
red
intensified
by
a
suitable
yellow
is
orange
this
blend
brings
red
almost
to
the
point
of
spreading
out
towards
the
spectator
but
the
element
of
red
is
always
sufficiently
strong
to
keep
the
colour
from
flippancy
orange
is
like
a
man
convinced
of
his
own
powers
its
note
is
that
of
the
angelus
or
of
an
old
violin
just
as
orange
is
red
brought
nearer
to
humanity
by
yellow
so
violet
is
red
withdrawn
from
humanity
by
blue
but
the
red
in
violet
must
be
cold
for
the
spiritual
need
does
not
allow
of
a
mixture
of
warm
red
with
cold
blue
violet
is
therefore
both
in
the
physical
and
spiritual
sense
a
cooled
red
it
is
consequently
rather
sad
and
ailing
it
is
worn
by
old
women
and
in
china
as
a
sign
of
mourning
in
music
it
is
an
english
horn
or
the
deep
notes
of
wood
instruments
a
bassoon

it
is
clear
that
all
i
have
said
of
these

is
very
provisional

general
and
so
also
are
those
feelings

which
have
been
quoted
as
parallels
of
the
colours
for
these
feelings
are
only
the

shades
of

those
of

are
of
a
much
finer
texture
and

emotions
too
fine
to
be
expressed
in

certainly
each
tone
will
find
some
probable
expression
in
words
but
it
will
always
be
incomplete
and
that
part
which
the
word
fails
to
express
will
not
be
unimportant
but
rather
the
very
kernel
of
its
existence
for
this
reason
words
are
and
will
always
remain
only
hints
mere
suggestions
of
colours
in
this
impossibility
of
expressing
colour
in
words
with
the
consequent
need
for
some
other
mode
of
expression
lies
the
opportunity
of
the
art
of
the
future
in
this
art
among
innumerable
rich
and
varied
combinations
there
is
one
which
is
founded
on
firm
fact
and
that
is
as
follows
the
actual
expression
of
colour
can
be
achieved
simultaneously
by
several
forms
of
art
each
art
playing
its
separate
part
and
producing
a
whole
which
exceeds
in
richness
and
force
any
expression
attainable
by
one
art
alone
the
immense
possibilities
of
depth
and
strength
to
be
gained
by
combination
or
by
discord
between
the
various
arts
can
be
easily
realized
it
is
often
said
that
admission
of
the
possibility
of
one
art
helping
another
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
necessary
differences
between
the
arts
this
is
however
not
the
case
as
has
been
said
an
absolutely
similar
inner
appeal
can
not
be
achieved
by
two
different
arts
even
if
it
were
possible
the
second
version
would
differ
at
least
outwardly
but
suppose
this
were
not
the
case
that
is
to
say
suppose
a
repetition
of
the
same
appeal
exactly
alike
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
could
be
achieved
by
different
arts
such
repetition
would
not
be
merely
superfluous
to
begin
with
different
people
find
sympathy
in
different
forms
of
art
alike
on
the
active
and
passive
side
among
the
creators
or
the
receivers
of
the
appeal
but
further
and
more
important
repetition
of
the
same
appeal
thickens
the
spiritual
atmosphere
which
is
necessary
for
the
maturing
of
the
finest
feelings
in
the
same
way
as
the
hot
air
of
a
greenhouse
is
necessary
for
the
ripening
of
certain
fruit
an
example
of
this
is
the
case
of
the
individual
who
receives
a
powerful
impression
from
constantly
repeated
actions
thoughts
or
feelings
although
if
they
came
singly
they
might
have
passed
by
unnoticed
footnote
this
idea
forms
of
course
the
fundamental
reason
for
advertisement
we
must
not
however
apply
this
rule
only
to
the
simple
examples
of
the
spiritual
atmosphere
for
this
atmosphere
is
like
air
which
can
be
either
pure
or
filled
with
various
alien
elements
not
only
visible
actions
thoughts
and
feelings
with
outward
expression
make
up
this
atmosphere
but
secret
happenings
of
which
no
one
knows
unspoken
thoughts
hidden
feelings
are
also
elements
in
it
suicide
murder

low
and
unworthy
thoughts
hate
hostility
egotism
envy
narrow
patriotism
partisanship
are
elements
in
the
spiritual
atmosphere
footnote
epidemics
of
suicide
or
of
violent

feeling
are
products
of
this
impure
atmosphere
and
conversely
mutual
help
lofty
thoughts
love
joy
in
the
success
of
others
humanity
justness
are
the
elements
which
slay
those
already
enumerated
as
the
sun
slays
the
microbes
and
restore
the
atmosphere
to
purity
footnote
these
elements
likewise
have
their
historical
periods
the
second
and
more
complicated
form
of
repetition
is
that
in
which
several
different
elements
make
mutual
use
of
different
forms
in
our
case
these
elements
are
the
different
arts
summed
up
in
the
art
of
the
future
and
this
form
of
repetition
is
even
more
powerful
for
the
different
natures
of
men
respond
to
the
different
elements
in
the
combination
for
one
the
musical
form
is
the
most
moving
and
impressive
for
another
the
pictorial
for
the
third
the
literary
and
so
on
there
reside
therefore
in
arts
which
are
outwardly
different
hidden
forces
equally
different
so
that
they
may
all
work
in
one
man
towards
a
single
result
even
though
each
art
may
be
working
in
isolation
this
sharply
defined
working
of
individual
colours
is
the
basis
on
which
various
values
can
be
built
up
in
harmony
pictures
will
come
to
be
painted
veritable
artistic
arrangements
planned
in
shades
of
one
colour
chosen
according
to
artistic
feeling
the
carrying
out
of
one
colour
the
binding
together
and
admixture
of
two
related
colours
are
the
foundations
of
most
coloured
harmonies
from
what
has
been
said
above
about
colour
working
from
the
fact
that
we
live
in
a
time
of
questioning
experiment
and
contradiction
we
can
draw
the
easy
conclusion
that
for
a
harmonization
on
the
basis
of
individual
colours
our
age
is
especially
unsuitable
perhaps
with
envy
and
with
a
mournful
sympathy
we
listen
to
the
music
of
mozart
it
acts
as
a
welcome
pause
in
the
turmoil
of
our
inner
life
as
a
consolation
and
as
a
hope
but
we
hear
it
as
the
echo
of
something
from
another
age
long
past
and
fundamentally
strange
to
us
the
strife
of
colours
the
sense
of
balance
we
have
lost
tottering
principles
unexpected
assaults
great
questions
apparently
useless
striving
storm
and
tempest
broken
chains
antitheses
and
contradictions
these
make
up
our
harmony
the
composition
arising
from
this
harmony
is
a
mingling
of
colour
and
form
each
with
its
separate
existence
but
each
blended
into
a
common
life
which
is
called
a
picture
by
the
force
of
the
inner
need
only
these
individual
parts
are
vital
everything
else
such
as
surrounding
conditions
is
subsidiary
the
combination
of
two
colours
is
a
logical
outcome
of
modern
conditions
the
combination
of
colours
hitherto
considered
discordant
is
merely
a
further
development
for
example
the
use
side
by
side
of
red
and
blue
colours
in
themselves
of
no
physical
relationship
but
from
their
very
spiritual
contrast
of
the
strongest
effect
is
one
of
the
most
frequent
occurrences
in
modern
choice
of
harmony
footnote
cf
gauguin
noa
noa
where
the
artist
states
his
disinclination
when
he
first
arrived
in
tahiti
to
juxtapose
red
and
blue
harmony
today
rests
chiefly
on
the
principle
of
contrast
which
has
for
all
time
been
one
of
the
most
important
principles
of
art
but
our
contrast
is
an
inner
contrast
which
stands
alone
and
rejects
the
help
for
that
help
would
mean
destruction
of
any
other
principles
of
harmony
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
very
placing
together
of
red
and
blue
was
so
beloved
by
the
primitive
both
in
germany
and
italy
that
it
has
till
today
survived
principally
in
folk
pictures
of
religious
subjects
one
often
sees
in
such
pictures
the
virgin
in
a
red
gown
and
a
blue
cloak
it
seems
that
the
artists
wished
to
express
the
grace
of
heaven
in
terms
of
humanity
and

by

forms
the
overstepping
of
these
boundaries
the
mingling
and
the
sharp
separation
of
surfaces
all
these
open
great
vistas
of
artistic
possibility
one
of
the
first
steps
in
the
turning
away
from
material
objects
into
the
realm
of
the
abstract
was
to
use
the
technical
artistic
term
the
rejection
of
the
third
dimension
that
is
to
say
the
attempt
to
keep
a
picture
on
a
single
plane
modelling
was
abandoned
in
this
way
the
material
object
was
made
more
abstract
and
an
important
step
forward
was
achieved
this
step
forward
has
however
had
the
effect
of
limiting
the
possibilities
of
painting
to
one
definite
piece
of
canvas
and
this
limitation
has
not
only
introduced
a
very
material
element
into
painting
but
has
seriously
lessened
its
possibilities
any
attempt
to
free
painting
from
this
material
limitation
together
with
the
striving
after
a
new
form
of
composition
must
concern
itself
first
of
all
with
the
destruction
of
this
theory
of
one
single
surface
attempts
must
be
made
to
bring
the
picture
on
to
some
ideal
plane
which
shall
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
material
plane
of
the
canvas
footnote
compare
the
article
by
le
fauconnier
in
the
catalogue
of
the
second
exhibition
of
the
neue
kunstlervereinigung
munich
there
has
arisen
out
of
the
composition
in
flat
triangles
a
composition
with
plastic
triangles
that
is
to
say
with
pyramids
and
that
is
cubism
but
there
has
arisen
here
also
the
tendency
to
inertia
to
a
concentration
on
this
form
for
its
own
sake
and
consequently
once
more
to
an
impoverishment
of
possibility
but
that
is
the
unavoidable
result
of
the
external
application
of
an
inner
principle
a
further
point
of
great
importance
must
not
be
forgotten
there
are
other
means
of
using
the
material
plane
as
a
space
of
three
dimensions
in
order
to
create
an
ideal
plane
the
thinness
or
thickness
of
a
line
the
placing
of
the

the
surface
the
overlaying
of
one
form
on
another
may
be
quoted
as
examples
of
artistic
means
that
may
be
employed
similar
possibilities
are
offered
by
colour
which
when
rightly
used
can
advance
or
retreat
and
can
make
of
the
picture
a
living
thing
and
so
achieve
an
artistic
expansion
of
space
the
combination
of
both

the
nature

it
results
that

been
made
once
more

must
be
laid
on
the

cf

no
henri
ravel
the
laws
of
harmony
are
the

for
painting
and
music
or
to
lay
down
a
firm
artistic
basis
all
attempts
to
do
so
would
have
one
result
namely
that
already
cited
in
the
case
of
leonardo
and
his
system
of
little
spoons
it
would
however
be
precipitate
to
say
that
there
are
no
basic
principles
nor
firm
rules
in
painting
or
that
a
search
for
them
leads
inevitably
to
academism
even
music
has
a
grammar
which
although
modified
from
time
to
time
is
of
continual
help
and
value
as
a
kind
of
dictionary
painting
is
however
in
a
different
position
the
revolt
from
dependence
on
nature
is
only
just
beginning
any
realization
of
the
inner
working
of
colour
and
form
is
so
far
unconscious
the
subjection
of
composition
to
some
geometrical
form
is
no
new
idea
cf
the
art
of
the
persians
construction
on
a
purely
abstract
basis
is
a
slow
business
and
at
first
seemingly
blind
and
aimless
the
artist
must
train
not
only
his
eye
but
also
his
soul
so
that
he
can
test
colours
for
themselves
and
not
only
by
external
impressions
if
we
begin
at
once
to
break
the
bonds
which
bind
us
to
nature
and
devote
ourselves
purely
to
combination
of
pure
colour
and
abstract
form
we
shall
produce
works
which
are
mere
decoration
which
are
suited
to
neckties
or
carpets
beauty
of
form
and
colour
is
no
sufficient
aim
by
itself
despite
the
assertions
of
pure
aesthetes
or
even
of
naturalists
who
are
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
beauty
it
is
because
of
the
elementary
stage
reached
by
our
painting
that
we
are
so
little
able
to
grasp
the
inner
harmony
of
true
colour
and
form
composition
the
nerve
vibrations
are
there
certainly
but
they
get
no
further
than
the
nerves
because
the
corresponding
vibrations
of
the
spirit
which
they
call
forth
are
too
weak
when
we
remember
however
that
spiritual
experience
is
quickening
that
positive
science
the
firmest
basis
of
human
thought
is
tottering
that
dissolution
of
matter
is
imminent
we
have
reason
to
hope
that
the
hour
of
pure
composition
is
not
far
away
it
must
not
be
thought
that
pure
decoration
is
lifeless
it
has
its
inner
being
but
one
which
is
either
incomprehensible
to
us
as
in
the
case
of
old
decorative
art
or
which
seems
mere
illogical
confusion
as
a
world
in
which
men
and
embryos
play
equal
roles
in
which
beings
deprived
of
limbs
are
on
a
level
with
noses
and
toes
which
live
isolated
and
of
their
own
vitality
the
confusion
is
like
that
of
a
kaleidoscope
which
though
possessing
a
life
of
its
own
belongs
to
another
sphere
nevertheless
decoration
has
its
effect
on
us
oriental
decoration
quite
differently
to
swedish
savage
or
ancient
greek
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
there
is
a
general
custom
of
describing
samples
of
decoration
as
gay
serious
sad
as
music
is
described
as
allegro
serioso
according
to
the
nature
of
the
piece
probably
conventional
decoration
had
its
beginnings
in
nature
but
when
we
would
assert
that
external
nature
is
the
sole
source
of
all
art
we
must
remember
that
in
patterning
natural
objects
are
used
as
symbols
almost
as
though
they
were
mere
hieroglyphics
for
this
reason
we
can
not
gauge
their
inner
harmony
for
instance
we
can
bear
a
design
of
chinese
dragons
in
our
dining
or
bed
rooms
and
are
no
more
disturbed
by
it
than
by
a
design
of
daisies
it
is
possible
that
towards
the
close
of
our
already
dying
epoch
a
new
decorative
art
will
develop
but
it
is
not
likely
to
be
founded
on
geometrical
form
at
the
present
time
any
attempt
to
define
this
new
art
would
be
as
useless
as
pulling
a
small
bud
open
so
as
to
make
a
fully
blown
flower
nowadays
we
are
still
bound
to
external
nature
and
must
find
our
means
of
expression
in
her
but
how
are
we
to
do
it
in
other
words
how
far
may
we
go
in
altering
the
forms
and
colours
of
this
nature
we
may
go
as
far
as
the
artist
is
able
to
carry
his
emotion
and
once
more
we
see
how
immense
is
the
need
for
true
emotion
a
few
examples
will
make
the
meaning
of
this
clearer
a
warm
red
tone
will
materially
alter
in
inner
value
when
it
is
no
longer
considered
as
an
isolated
colour
as
something
abstract
but
is
applied
as
an
element
of
some
other
object
and
combined
with
natural
form
the
variety
of
natural
forms
will
create
a
variety
of
spiritual
values
all
of
which
will
harmonize
with
that
of
the
original
isolated
red
suppose
we
combine
red
with
sky
flowers
a
garment
a
face
a
horse
a
tree
a
red
sky
suggests
to
us
sunset
or
fire
and
has
a
consequent
effect
upon
us
either
of
splendour
or
menace
much
depends
now
on
the
way
in
which
other
objects
are
treated
in
connection
with
this
red
sky
if
the
treatment
is
faithful
to
nature
but
all
the
same
harmonious
the
naturalistic
appeal
of
the
sky
is
strengthened
if
however
the
other
objects
are
treated
in
a
way
which
is
more
abstract
they
tend
to
lessen
if
not
to
destroy
the
naturalistic
appeal
of
the
sky
much
the
same
applies
to
the
use
of
red
in
a
human
face
in
this
case
red
can
be
employed
to
emphasize
the
passionate
or
other
characteristics
of
the
model
with
a
force
that
only
an
extremely
abstract
treatment
of
the
rest
of
the
picture
can
subdue
a
red
garment
is
quite
a
different
matter
for
it
can
in
reality
be
of
any
colour
red
will
however
be
found
best
to
supply
the
needs
of
pure
artistry
for
here
alone
can
it
be
used
without
any
association
with
material
aims
the
artist
has
to
consider
not
only
the
value
of
the
red
cloak
by
itself
but
also
its
value
in
connection
with
the
figure
wearing
it
and
further
the
relation
of
the
figure
to
the
whole
picture
suppose
the
picture
to
be
a
sad
one
and
the
figure
to
be
the
central
point
on
which
the
sadness
is
concentrated
either
from
its
central
position
or
features
attitude
colour
or
what
not
the
red
will
provide
an
acute
discord
of
feeling
which
will
emphasize
the
gloom
of
the
picture
the
use
of
a
colour
in
itself
sad
would
weaken
the
effect
of
the
dramatic
whole
footnote
once
more
it
is
wise
to
emphasize
the
necessary
inadequacy
of
these
examples
rules
can
not
be
laid
down
the
variations
are
so
endless
a
single
line
can
alter
the
whole
composition
of
a
picture
this
is
the
principle
of
antithesis
already
defined
red
by
itself
can
not
have
a
sad
effect
on
the
spectator
and
its
inclusion
in
a
sad
picture
will
if
properly
handled
provide
the
dramatic
element
footnote
the
use
of
terms
like
sad
and
joyful
are
only
clumsy
equivalents
for
the
delicate
spiritual
vibrations
of
the
new
harmony
they
must
be
read
as
necessarily
inadequate
yet
again
is
the
case
of
a
red
tree
different
the
fundamental
value
of
red
remains
as
in
every
case
but
the
association
of
autumn
creeps
in
the
colour
combines
easily
with
this
association
and
there
is
no
dramatic
clash
as
in
the
case
of
the
red
cloak
finally
the
red
horse
provides
a
further
variation
the
very
words
put
us
in
another
atmosphere
the
impossibility
of
a
red
horse
demands
an
unreal
world
it
is
possible
that
this
combination
of
colour
and
form
will
appeal
as
a
freak
a
purely
superficial
and
appeal
or
as
a
hint
of
a
fairy
story
footnote
an
incomplete
fairy
story
works
on
the
mind
as
does
a
cinematograph
film
once
more
a
appeal
to
set
this
red
horse
in
a
careful
naturalistic
landscape
would
create
such
a
discord
as
to
produce
no
appeal
and
no
coherence
the
need
for
coherence
is
the
essential
of
harmony
whether
founded
on
conventional
discord
or
concord
the
new
harmony
demands
that
the
inner
value
of
a
picture
should
remain
unified
whatever
the
variations
or
contrasts
of
outward
form
or
colour
the
elements
of
the
new
art
are
to
be
found
therefore
in
the
inner
and
not
the
outer
qualities
of
nature
the
spectator
is
too
ready
to
look
for
a
meaning
in
a
picture
some
outward
connection
between
its
various
parts
our
materialistic
age
has
produced
a
type
of
spectator
or
connoisseur
who
is
not
content
to
put
himself
opposite
a
picture
and
let
it
say
its
own
message
instead
of
allowing
the
inner
value
of
the
picture
to
work
he
worries
himself
in
looking
for
closeness
to
nature
or
temperament
or
handling
or
tonality
or
perspective
or
what
not
his
eye
does
not
probe
the
outer
expression
to
arrive
at
the
inner
meaning
in
a
conversation
with
an
interesting
person
we
endeavour
to
get
at
his
fundamental
ideas
and
feelings
we
do
not
bother
about
the
words
he
uses
nor
the
spelling
of
those
words
nor
the
breath
necessary
for
speaking
them
nor
the
movements
of
his
tongue
and
lips
nor
the
psychological
working
on
our
brain
nor
the
physical
sound
in
our
ear
nor
the
physiological
effect
on
our
nerves
we
realize
that
these
things
though
interesting
and
important
are
not
the
main
things
of
the
moment
but
that
the
meaning
and
idea
is
what
concerns
us
we
should
have
the
same
feeling
when
confronted
with
a
work
of
art
when
this
becomes
general
the
artist
will
be
able
to
dispense
with
natural
form
and
colour
and
speak
in
purely
artistic
language
to
return
to
the
combination
of
colour
and
form
there
is
another
possibility
which
should
be
noted
objects
in
a
picture
may
have
a
literary
appeal
and
the
whole
picture
may
have
the
working
of
a
fable
the
spectator
is
put
in
an
atmosphere
which
does
not
disturb
him
because
he
accepts
it
as
fabulous
and
in
which
he
tries
to
trace
the
story
and
undergoes
more
or
less
the
various
appeals
of
colour
but
the
pure
inner
working
of
colour
is
impossible
the
outward
idea
has
the
mastery
still
for
the
spectator
has
only
exchanged
a
blind
reality
for
a
blind
dreamland
where
the
truth
of
inner
feeling
can
not
be
felt
we
must
find
therefore
a
form
of
expression
which
excludes
the
fable
and
yet
does
not
restrict
the
free
working
of
colour
in
any
way
the
forms
movement
and
colours
which
we
borrow
from
nature
must
produce
no
outward
effect
nor
be
associated
with
external
objects
the
more
obvious
is
the
separation
from
nature
the
more
likely
is
the
inner
meaning
to
be
pure
and
unhampered
the
tendency
of
a
work
of
art
may
be
very
simple
but
provided
it
is
not
dictated
by
any
external
motive
and
provided
it
is
not
working
to
any
material
end
the
harmony
will
be
pure
the
most
ordinary
action
for
example
preparation
for
lifting
a
heavy
weight
becomes
mysterious
and
dramatic
when
its
actual
purpose
is
not
revealed
we
stand
and
gaze
fascinated
till
of
a
sudden
the
explanation
bursts
suddenly
upon
us
it
is
the
conviction
that
nothing
mysterious
can
ever
happen
in
our
everyday
life
that
has
destroyed
the
joy
of
abstract
thought
practical
considerations
have
ousted
all
else
it
is
with
this
fact
in
view
that
the
new
dancing
is
being
evolved
as
that
is
to
say
the
only
means
of
giving
in
terms
of
time
and
space
the
real
inner
meaning
of
motion
the
origin
of
dancing
is
probably
purely
sexual
in
we
still
see
this
element
plainly
the
later
development
of
dancing
as
a
religious
ceremony
joins
itself
to
the
preceding
element
and
the
two
together
take
artistic
form
and
emerge
as
the
ballet
the
ballet
at
the
present
time
is
in
a
state
of
chaos
owing
to
this
double
origin
its
external
motives
the
expression
of
love
and
fear
are
too
material
and
naive
for
the
abstract
ideas
of
the
future
in
the
search
for
more
subtle
expression
our
modern
reformers
have
looked
to
the
past
for
help
isadora
duncan
has
forged
a
link
between
the
greek
dancing
and
that
of
the
future
in
this
she
is
working
on
parallel
lines
to
the
painters
who
are
looking
for
inspiration
from
the
primitives
footnote
kandinsky
example
of
isadora
duncan
is
not
perhaps
perfectly
chosen
this
famous
dancer
founds
her
art
mainly
upon
a
study
of
greek
vases
and
not
necessarily
of
the
primitive
period
her
aims
are
distinctly
towards
what
kandinsky
calls
conventional
beauty
and
what
is
perhaps
more
important
her
movements
are
not
dictated
solely
by
the
inner
harmony
but
largely
by
conscious
outward
imitation
of
greek
attitudes
either
nijinsky
later
ballets
le
sacre
du
printemps
faune
jeux
or
the
idea
actuating
the
jacques
dalcroze
system
of
eurhythmics
seem
to
fall
more
into
line
with
kandinsky
artistic
forecast
in
the
first
case
conventional
beauty
has
been
abandoned
to
the
dismay
of
numbers
of
writers
and
spectators
and
a
definite
return
has
been
made
to
primitive
angles
and
abruptness
in
the
second
case
motion
and
dance
are
brought
out
of
the
souls
of
the
pupils
truly
spontaneous
at
the
call
of
the
inner
harmony
indeed
a
comparison
between
isadora
duncan
and
dalcroze
is
a
comparison
between
the
naturalist
and
symbolist
ideals
in
art
which
were
outlined
in
the
introduction
to
this
in
dance
as
in
painting
this
is
only
a
stage
of
transition
in
dancing
as
in
painting
we
are
on
the
threshold
of
the
art
of
the
future
the
same
rules
must
be
applied
in
both
cases
conventional
beauty
must
go
by
the
board
and
the
literary
element
of
or
anecdote
must
be
abandoned
as
useless
both
arts
must
learn
from
music
that
every
harmony
and
every
discord
which
springs
from
the
inner
spirit
is
beautiful
but
that
it
is
essential
that
they
should
spring
from
the
inner
spirit
and
from
that
alone
the
achievement
of
the
of
the
future
will
make
possible
the
first
ebullition
of
the
art
of
spiritual
harmony
the
true
the
composition
for
the
new
theatre
will
consist
of
these
three
elements
musical
movement
pictorial
movement
physical
movement
and
these
three
properly
combined
make
up
the
spiritual
movement
which
is
the
working
of
the
inner
harmony
they
will
be
interwoven
in
harmony
and
discord
as
are
the
two
chief
elements
of
painting
form
and
colour
scriabin
attempt
to
intensify
musical
tone
by
corresponding
use
of
colour
is
necessarily
tentative
in
the
perfected
the
two
elements
are
increased
by
the
third
and
endless
possibilities
of
combination
and
individual
use
are
opened
up
further
the
external
can
be
combined
with
the
internal
harmony
as
schonberg
has
attempted
in
his
quartettes
it
is
impossible
here
to
go
further
into
the
developments
of
this
idea
the
reader
must
apply
the
principles
of
painting
already
stated
to
the
problem
of
and
outline
for
himself
the
possibilities
of
the
theatre
of
the
future
founded
on
the
immovable
principle
of
the
inner
need
from
what
has
been
said
of
the
combination
of
colour
and
form
the
way
to
the
new
art
can
be
traced
this
way
lies
today
between
two
dangers
on
the
one
hand
is
the
totally
arbitrary
application
of
colour
to
geometrical
form
pure
patterning
on
the
other
hand
is
the
more
naturalistic
use
of
colour
in
bodily
form
pure
phantasy
either
of
these
alternatives
may
in
their
turn
be
exaggerated
everything
is
at
the
artist
disposal
and
the
freedom
of
today
has
at
once
its
dangers
and
its
possibilities
we
may
be
present
at
the
conception
of
a
new
great
epoch
or
we
may
see
the
opportunity
squandered
in
aimless
extravagance

new
principles
do
not
fall
from
heaven
but
are
logically
if
indirectly
connected
with
past
and
future
what
is
important
to
us
is
the
momentary
position
of
the
principle
and
how
best
it
can
be
used
it
must
not
be
employed
forcibly
but
if
the
artist
tunes
his
soul
to
this
note
the
sound
will
ring
in
his
work
of
itself
the
emancipation
of
today
must
advance
on
the
lines
of
the
inner
need
it
is
hampered
at
present
by
external
form
and
as
that
is
thrown
aside
there
arises
as
the
aim
of
the
search
for
constructive
form
has
produced
cubism
in
which
natural
form
is
often
forcibly
subjected
to
geometrical
construction
a
process
which
tends
to
hamper
the
abstract
by
the
concrete
and
spoil
the
concrete
by
the
abstract
the
harmony
of
the
new
art
demands
a
more
subtle
construction
than
this
something
that
appeals
less
to
the
eye
and
more
to
the
soul
this
concealed
construction
may
arise
from
an
apparently
fortuitous
selection
of
forms
on
the
canvas
their
external
lack
of
cohesion
is
their
internal
harmony
this
haphazard
arrangement
of
forms
may
be
the
future
of
artistic
harmony
their
fundamental
relationship
will
finally
be
able
to
be
expressed
in
mathematical
form
but
in
terms
irregular
rather
than
regular
viii
art
and
artists
the
work
of
art
is
born
of
the
artist
in
a
mysterious
and
secret
way
from
him
it
gains
life
and
being
nor
is
its
existence
casual
and
inconsequent
but
it
has
a
definite
and
purposeful
strength
alike
in
its
material
and
spiritual
life
it
exists
and
has
power
to
create
spiritual
atmosphere
and
from
this
inner
standpoint
one
judges
whether
it
is
a
good
work
of
art
or
a
bad
one
if
its
form
is
bad
it
means
that
the
form
is
too
feeble
in
meaning
to
call
forth
corresponding
vibrations
of
the
soul
footnote
indecent
pictures
are
either
incapable
of
causing
vibrations
of
the
soul
in
which
case
they
are
not
art
or
they
are
so
capable
in
the
latter
case
they
are
not
to
be
spurned
absolutely
even
though
at
the
same
time
they
gratify
what
nowadays
we
are
pleased
to
call
the
lower
bodily
tastes
therefore
a
picture
is
not
necessarily
well
painted
if
it
possesses
the
values
of
which
the
french
so
constantly
speak
it
is
only
well
painted
if
its
spiritual
value
is
complete
and
satisfying
good
drawing
is
drawing
that
can
not
be
altered
without
destruction
of
this
inner
value
quite
irrespective
of
its
correctness
as
anatomy
botany
or
any
other
science
there
is
no
question
of
a
violation
of
natural
form
but
only
of
the
need
of
the
artist
for
such
form
similarly
colours
are
used
not
because
they
are
true
to
nature
but
because
they
are
necessary
to
the
particular
picture
in
fact
the
artist
is
not
only
justified
in
using
but
it
is
his
duty
to
use
only
those
forms
which
fulfil
his
own
need
absolute
freedom
whether
from
anatomy
or
anything
of
the
kind
must
be
given
the
artist
in
his
choice
of
material
such
spiritual
freedom
is
as
necessary
in
art
as
it
is
in
life
footnote
this
freedom
is
man
weapon
against
the
philistines
it
is
based
on
the
inner
need
note
however
that
blind
following
of
scientific
precept
is
less
blameworthy
than
its
blind
and
purposeless
rejection
the
former
produces
at
least
an
imitation
of
material
objects
which
may
be
of
some
use
footnote
plainly
an
imitation
of
nature
if
made
by
the
hand
of
an
artist
is
not
a
pure
reproduction
the
voice
of
the
soul
will
in
some
degree
at
least
make
itself
heard
as
contrasts
one
may
quote
a
landscape
of
canaletto
and
those
sadly
famous
heads
by
alte
pinakothek
munich
the
latter
is
an
artistic
betrayal
and
brings
confusion
in
its
train
the
former
leaves
the
spiritual
atmosphere
empty
the
latter
poisons
it
painting
is
an
art
and
art
is
not
vague
production
transitory
and
isolated
but
a
power
which
must
be
directed
to
the
improvement
and
refinement
of
the
human
soul
to
in
fact
the
raising
of
the
spiritual
triangle
if
art
refrains
from
doing
this
work
a
chasm
remains
unbridged
for
no
other
power
can
take
the
place
of
art
in
this
activity
and
at
times
when
the
human
soul
is
gaining
greater
strength
art
will
also
grow
in
power
for
the
two
are
inextricably
connected
and
complementary
one
to
the
other
conversely
at
those
times
when
the
soul
tends
to
be
choked
by
material
disbelief
art
becomes
purposeless
and
talk
is
heard
that
art
exists
for
sake
alone
footnote
this
cry
art
for
art
sake
is
really
the
best
ideal
such
an
age
can
attain
to
it
is
an
unconscious
protest
against
materialism
against
the
demand
that
everything
should
have
a
use
and
practical
value
it
is
further
proof
of
the
indestructibility
of
art
and
of
the
human
soul
which
can
never
be
killed
but
only
temporarily
smothered
then
is
the
bond
between
art
and
the
soul
as
it
were
drugged
into
unconsciousness
the
artist
and
the
spectator
drift
apart
till
finally
the
latter
turns
his
back
on
the
former
or
regards
him
as
a
juggler
whose
skill
and
dexterity
are
worthy
of
applause
it
is
very
important
for
the
artist
to
gauge
his
position
aright
to
realize
that
he
has
a
duty
to
his
art
and
to
himself
that
he
is
not
king
of
the
castle
but
rather
a
servant
of
a
nobler
purpose
he
must
search
deeply
into
his
own
soul
develop
and
tend
it
so
that
his
art
has
something
to
clothe
and
does
not
remain
a
glove
without
a
hand
the
artist
must
have
something
to
say
for
mastery
over
form
is
not
his
goal
but
rather
the
adapting
of
form
to
its
inner
meaning
footnote
naturally
this
does
not
mean
that
the
artist
is
to
instill
forcibly
into
his
work
some
deliberate
meaning
as
has
been
said
the
generation
of
a
work
of
art
is
a
mystery
so
long
as
artistry
exists
there
is
no
need
of
theory
or
logic
to
direct
the
painter
action
the
inner
voice
of
the
soul
tells
him
what
form
he
needs
whether
inside
or
outside
nature
every
artist
knows
who
works
with
feeling
how
suddenly
the
right
form
flashes
upon
him
bocklin
said
that
a
true
work
of
art
must
be
like
an
inspiration
that
actual
painting
composition
are
not
the
steps
by
which
the
artist
reaches
the
artist
is
not
born
to
a
life
of
pleasure
he
must
not
live
idle
he
has
a
hard
work
to
perform
and
one
which
often
proves
a
cross
to
be
borne
he
must
realize
that
his
every
deed
feeling
and
thought
are
raw
but
sure
material
from
which
his
work
is
to
arise
that
he
is
free
in
art
but
not
in
life
the
artist
has
a
triple
responsibility
to
the
he
must
repay
the
talent
which
he
has
his
deeds
feelings
and
thoughts
as
those
of
every
man
create
a
spiritual
atmosphere
which
is
either
pure
or
poisonous
these
deeds
and
thoughts
are
materials
for
his
creations
which
themselves
exercise
influence
on
the
spiritual
atmosphere
the
artist
is
not
only
a
king
as
peladan
says
because
he
has
great
power
but
also
because
he
has
great
duties
if
the
artist
be
priest
of
beauty
nevertheless
this
beauty
is
to
be
sought
only
according
to
the
principle
of
the
inner
need
and
can
be
measured
only
according
to
the
size
and
intensity
of
that
need
that
is
beautiful
which
is
produced
by
the
inner
need
which
springs
from
the
soul
maeterlinck
one
of
the
first
warriors
one
of
the
first
modern
artists
of
the
soul
says
there
is
nothing
on
earth
so
curious
for
beauty
or
so
absorbent
of
it
as
a
soul
for
that
reason
few
mortal
souls
withstand
the
leadership
of
a
soul
which
gives
to
them
beauty

and

ix
conclusion
the
first
five
illustrations
in
this
book
show
the
course
of
constructive
effort
in
painting
this
effort
falls
into
two
divisions
simple
composition
which
is
regulated
according
to
an
obvious
and
simple
form
this
kind
of
composition
i
call
the
melodic
complex
composition
consisting
of
various
forms
subjected
more
or
less
completely
to
a
principal
form
probably
the
principal
form
may
be
hard
to
grasp
outwardly
and
for
that
reason
possessed
of
a
strong
inner
value
this
kind
of
composition
i
call
the
symphonic
between
the
two
lie
various
transitional
forms
in
which
the
melodic
principle
predominates
the
history
of
the
development
is
closely
parallel
to
that
of
music
if
in
considering
an
example
of
melodic
composition
one
forgets
the
material
aspect
and
probes
down
into
the
artistic
reason
of
the
whole
one
finds
primitive
geometrical
forms
or
an
arrangement
of
simple
lines
which
help
toward
a
common
motion
this
common
motion
is
echoed
by
various
sections
and
may
be
varied
by
a
single
line
or
form
such
isolated
variations
serve
different
purposes
for
instance
they
may
act
as
a
sudden
check
or
to
use
a
musical
term
a
fermata
footnote

mosaic
which
in
the
main
forms
a
triangle
the
upright
figures
lean
proportionately
to
the
triangle
the
outstretched
arm
and
are
the
fermate
each
form
which
goes
to
make
up
the
composition
has
a
simple
inner
value
which
has
in
its
turn
a
melody
for
this
reason
i
call
the
composition
melodic
by
the
agency
of
cezanne
and
later
of
hodler
footnote
english
readers
may
roughly
parallel
hodler
with
augustus
john
for
purposes
of
the
this
kind
of
composition
won
new
life
and
earned
the
name
of
rhythmic
the
limitations
of
the
term
rhythmic
are
obvious
in
music
and
nature
each
manifestation
has
a
rhythm
of
its
own
so
also
in
painting
in
nature
this
rhythm
is
often
not
clear
to
us
because
its
purpose
is
not
clear
to
us
we
then
speak
of
it
as
unrhythmic
so
the
terms
rhythmic
and
unrhythmic
are
purely
conventional
as
also
are
harmony
and
discord
which
have
no
actual
existence
footnote
as
an
example
of
plain
melodic
construction
with
a
plain
rhythm
cezanne

women
is
given
in
this
book
complex
rhythmic
composition
with
a
strong
flavour
of
the
symphonic
is
seen
in
numerous
pictures
and
woodcuts
of
the
past
one
might
mention
the
work
of
old
german
masters
of
the
persians
of
the
japanese
the
russian
icons
broadsides
etc
footnote
this
applies
to
many
of
hodler
pictures
in
nearly
all
these
works
the
symphonic
composition
is
not
very
closely
allied
to
the
melodic
this
means
that
fundamentally
there
is
a
composition
founded
on
rest
and
balance
the
mind
thinks
at
once
of
choral
compositions
of
mozart
and
beethoven
all
these
works
have
the
solemn
and
regular
architecture
of
a
gothic
cathedral
they
belong
to
the
transition
period
as
examples
of
the
new
symphonic
composition
in
which
the
melodic
element
plays
a
subordinate
part
and
that
only
rarely
i
have
added
reproductions
of
four
of
my
own
pictures
they
represent
three
different
sources
of
inspiration
a
direct
impression
of
outward
nature
expressed
in
purely
artistic
form
this
i
call
an
impression
a
largely
unconscious
spontaneous
expression
of
inner
character
the
nature
this
i
call
an
improvisation
an
expression
of
a
slowly
formed
inner
feeling
which
comes
to
utterance
only
after
long
maturing
this
i
call
a
composition
in
this
reason
consciousness
purpose
play
an
overwhelming
part
but
of
the
calculation
nothing
appears
only
the
feeling
which
kind
of
construction
whether
conscious
or
unconscious
really
underlies
my
work
the
patient
reader
will
readily
understand
finally
i
would
remark
that
in
my
opinion
we
are
fast
approaching
the
time
of
reasoned
and
conscious
composition
when
the
painter
will
be
proud
to
declare
his
work
constructive
this
will
be
in
contrast
to
the
claim
of
the
impressionists
that
they
could
explain
nothing
that
their
art
came
upon
them
by
inspiration
we
have
before
us
the
age
of
conscious
creation
and
this
new
spirit
in
painting
is
going
hand
in
hand
with
the
spirit
of
thought
towards
an
epoch
of
great
spiritual
leaders
