and
kat
at
all
their

a
short
pair
of

so
the

vrouw
vedder
said
they
can
not
be
called
christopher
and
katrina
until
they
are
four
and
a
half
feet
high
now
it
takes
a
long
time
to
grow
four
and
a
half
feet
of
boy
and
girl
you
know
chickens
and
puppies
and
colts
and
kittens
always
grow
up
much
faster
than
twins
kit
and
kat
ate
a
great
many
breakfasts
and
dinners
and
suppers
and
played
a
great
many
plays
and
had
a
great
many
happy
days
while
they
were
growing
up
to
their
names
i
will
tell
you
about
some
of
them
i
the
day
they
went
fishing
one
summer
morning
very
early
vrouw
vedder
opened
the
door
of
her
little
dutch
kitchen
and
stepped
out
she
looked
across
the
road
which
ran
by
the
house
across
the
canal
on
the
other
side
across
the
level
green
fields
that
lay
beyond
clear
to
the
blue
rim
of
the
world
where
the
sky
touches
the
earth
the
sky
was
very
blue
and
the
great
round
shining
face
of
the
sun
was
just
peering
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
as
she
looked
out
vrouw
vedder
listened
the
roosters
in
the
barnyard
were
crowing
the
ducks
in
the
canal
were
quacking
and
all
the
little
birds
in
the
fields
were
singing
for
joy
vrouw
vedder
hummed
a
slow
little
tune
of
her
own
as
she
went
back
into
her
kitchen
kit
and
kat
were
still
asleep
in
their
little
cupboard
bed
she
gave
them
each
a
kiss
the
twins
opened
their
eyes
and
sat
up
o
kit
and
kat
said
vrouw
vedder
the
sun
is
up
the
birds
are
all
awake
and
singing
and
grandfather
is
going
fishing
if
you
will
hurry
you
may
go
with
him
he
is
coming
at
six
so
pop
out
of
bed
and
get
dressed
i
will
put
some
lunch
for
you
in
the
yellow
basket
and
you
may
dig
worms
for
bait
in
the
garden
only
be
sure
not
to
step
on
the
young
cabbages
that
father
planted
kit
and
kat
bounced
out
of
bed
in
a
minute
their
mother
helped
them
put
on
their
clothes
and
new
wooden
shoes
then
she
gave
them
each
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
for
their
breakfast
they
ate
it
sitting
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
this
is
a
picture
of
kit
and
kat
digging
worms
you
see
they
did
just
as
their
mother
said
and
did
not
step
on
the
young
cabbages
they
sat
on
them
instead
but
that
was
an
accident
kit
dug
the
worms
and
kat
put
them
into
a
basket
with
some
earth
in
it
to
make
them
feel
at
home
when
grandfather
came
he
brought
a
large
for
himself
and
two
little
ones
for
the
twins
there
was
a
little
hook
on
the
end
of
each
line
vrouw
vedder
kissed
kit
and
kat
mind
grandfather
and
do
fall
into
the
water
she
said
grandfather
and
the
twins
started
off
together
down
the
long
road
beside
the
canal
the
house
where
the
twins
lived
was
right
beside
the
canal
their
father
was
a
gardener
and
his
beautiful
rows
of
cabbages
and
beets
and
onions
stretched
in
long
lines
across
the
level
fields
by
the
roadside
grandfather
lived
in
a
large
town
a
little
way
beyond
the
farm
where
the
twins
lived
he
did
not
often
have
a
holiday
because
he
carried
milk
to
the
doors
of
the
people
in
the
town
every
morning
early
sometime
i
will
tell
you
how
he
did
it
but
i
must
not
tell
you
now
because
if
i
do
i
ca
tell
you
about
their
going
fishing
this
morning
grandfather
carried
his
rod
and
the
kit
and
kat
carried
the
basket
of
worms
between
them
and
their
rods
over
their
shoulders
and
they
were
all
three
very
happy
they
walked
along
ever
so
far
beside
the
canal
then
they
turned
to
the
left
and
walked
along
a
path
that
ran
from
the
canal
across
the
green
fields
to
what
looked
like
a
hill
but
it
was
a
hill
at
all
really
because
there
are
any
hills
in
holland
it
was
a
long
long
wall
of
earth
very
high
oh
as
high
as
a
house
or
even
higher
and
it
had
sloping
sides
there
is
such
a
wall
of
earth
all
around
the
country
of
holland
where
the
twins
live
there
has
to
be
a
wall
because
the
sea
is
higher
than
the
land
if
there
were
no
walls
to
shut
out
the
sea
the
whole
country
would
be
covered
with
water
and
if
that
were
so
then
there
be
any
holland
or
any
holland
twins
or
any
story
so
you
see
it
was
very
lucky
for
the
twins
that
the
wall
was
there
they
called
it
a
dyke
grandfather
and
kit
and
kat
climbed
the
dyke
when
they
reached
the
top
they
sat
down
a
few
minutes
to
rest
and
look
at
the
great
blue
sea
grandfather
sat
in
the
middle
with
kit
on
one
side
and
kat
on
the
other
and
the
basket
of
worms
and
the
basket
of
lunch
were
there
too
they
saw
a
great
ship
sail
slowly
by
making
a
cloud
of
smoke
where
do
the
ships
go
grandfather
asked
kit
to
america
and
england
and
china
and
all
over
the
world
said
grandfather
why
asked
kat
kat
almost
always
said
why
and
when
she
did
kit
did
to
take
flax
and
linen
from
the
mills
of
holland
to
make
dresses
for
little
girls
in
other
countries
said
grandfather
is
that
all
asked
kit
they
take
cheese
and
herring
bulbs
and
butter
and
lots
of
other
things
besides
and
bring
back
to
us
wheat
and
meat
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
from
the
lands
across
the
sea
i
think
i
be
a
sea
captain
when
i
big
said
kit
so
will
i
said
kat
girls
ca
said
kit
but
grandfather
shook
his
head
and
said
you
ca
tell
what
a
girl
may
be
by
the
time
she
four
feet
and
a
half
high
and
is
called
katrina
there
no
telling
what
girls
will
do
anyway
but
children
if
we
stay
here
we
shall
not
catch
any
fish
so
they
went
down
the
other
side
of
the
dyke
and
cut
onto
a
little
pier
that
ran
from
the
sandy
beach
into
the
water
grandfather
showed
them
how
to
bait
their
hooks
kit
baited
kat
for
her
because
kat
said
it
made
her
all
wriggly
inside
to
do
it
she
did
not
like
it
neither
did
the
worm
they
all
sat
down
on
the
end
of
the
pier
grandfather
sat
on
the
very
end
and
let
his
wooden
shoes
hang
down
over
the
water
but
he
made
kit
and
kat
sit
with
their
feet
stuck
straight
out
in
front
of
them
so
they
just
reached
to
the
edge
so
you
ca
fall
in
said
grandfather
they
dropped
their
hooks
into
the
water
and
sat
very
still
waiting
for
a
bite
the
sun
climbed
higher
and
higher
in
the
sky
and
it
grew
hotter
and
hotter
on
the
pier
the
flies
tickled
kat
nose
and
made
her
sneeze
keep
still
ca
you
said
kit
crossly
you
scare
the
fish
girls
do
know
how
to
fish
anyway
pretty
soon
kat
felt
a
queer
little
jerk
on
her
line
she
was
perfectly
sure
she
did
kat
squealed
and
jerked
her
rod
she
jerked
it
so
hard
that
one
foot
flew
right
up
in
the
air
and
one
of
her
new
wooden
shoes
went
splash
right
into
the
water
but
that
was
the
worst
of
it
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
kat
hook
flew
around
and
caught
in
kit
clothes
and
pricked
him
kit
jumped
and
said
ow
and
then
no
one
could
ever
tell
how
it
happened
there
was
kit
in
the
water
too
splashing
like
a
young
whale
with
kat
hook
still
holding
fast
to
his
clothes
in
the
back
grandfather
jumped
then
too
you
may
be
sure
he
caught
hold
of
rod
and
pulled
hard
and
called
out
steady
there
steady
and
in
one
minute
there
was
kit
in
the
shallow
water
beside
the
pier
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
grampus
grandfather
reached
down
and
pulled
him
up
when
kit
was
safely
on
the
pier
kat
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
though
the
water
was
running
down
in
streams
from
his
hair
and
eyes
and
ears
o
kit
she
said
i
truly
thought
it
was
a
fish
on
my
line
when
i
jumped
just
like
a
said
kit
they
do
know
how
to
you
see
his
teeth
were
chattering
because
the
water
was
cold
well
anyway
said
kat
i
caught
more
than
you
did
i
caught
you
then
kat
thought
of
something
else
she
shook
her
finger
at
kit
o
kit
she
said
mother
told
you
not
to
fall
into
the
water
all
your
fault
roared
kit
began
it
anyway
where
is
your
new
wooden
shoe
where
are
both
of
yours
screamed
kat
sure
enough
where
were
they
no
one
had
thought
about
shoes
because
they
were
thinking
so
hard
about
kit
they
ran
to
the
end
of
the
pier
and
looked
there
was
kat
shoe
sailing
away
toward
america
like
a
little
boat
kit
were
still
bobbing
about
in
the
water
near
the
pier
oh
oh
oh
shrieked
kat
but
the
tide
was
going
out
and
carrying
her
shoe
farther
away
every
minute
they
could
not
get
it
but
grandfather
reached
down
with
his
rod
and
fished
out
both
of
kit
shoes
then
kat
took
off
her
other
one
and
her
stockings
and
they
all
three
went
back
to
the
beach
grandfather
and
kat
covered
kit
up
with
sand
to
keep
him
warm
while
his
clothes
were
drying
then
grandfather
stuck
the
twins
up
in
the
sand
and
tied
the
lines
together
for
a
and
hung
clothes
up
on
it
and
kat
put
their
three
wooden
shoes
in
a
row
beside
kit
then
they
ate
their
luncheon
of
bread
and
butter
cheese
and
milk
with
some
radishes
from
father
garden
it
tasted
very
good
even
if
it
was
sandy
after
lunch
grandfather
said
it
will
never
do
to
go
home
without
any
fish
at
all
so
by
and
by
he
went
back
to
the
pier
and
caught
one
while
the
twins
played
in
the
sand
he
put
it
in
the
to
carry
home
kat
brought
shells
and
pebbles
to
kit
because
he
had
to
stay
covered
up
in
the
sand
and
kit
built
a
play
dyke
all
around
himself
with
them
and
kat
dug
a
canal
outside
the
dyke
then
she
made
in
and
set
them
in
a
row
in
the
sun
to
bake
they
played
until
the
shadow
of
the
dyke
grew
very
long
across
the
sandy
beach
and
then
grandfather
said
it
was
time
to
go
home
he
helped
kit
dress
but
kit
clothes
were
still
a
little
wet
in
the
thick
parts
and
kat
had
to
go
barefooted
and
carry
her
one
wooden
shoe
they
climbed
the
dyke
and
crossed
the
fields
and
walked
along
the
road
by
the
canal
the
road
shone
like
a
strip
of
yellow
ribbon
across
the
green
field
they
walked
quite
slowly
for
they
were
tired
and
sleepy
by
and
by
kit
said
i
see
our
house
and
kat
said
i
see
mother
at
the
gate
grandfather
gave
the
fish
he
caught
to
kit
and
kat
and
vrouw
vedder
cooked
it
for
their
supper
and
though
it
was
not
a
very
big
fish
they
all
had
some
grandfather
must
have
told
vrouw
vedder
something
about
what
had
happened
for
that
night
when
she
put
kit
to
bed
she
felt
of
his
clothes
carefully
but
she
did
say
a
word
about
their
being
damp
and
she
said
to
kat
we
will
see
the
shoemaker
and
have
him
make
you
another
shoe
then
kit
and
kat
hugged
her
and
said
and
popped
off
to
sleep
before
you
could
wink
your
eyes
ii
market
day
with
father
one
afternoon
kit
and
kat
were
playing
around
the
kitchen
doorstep
while
their
mother
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
door
peeling
some
onions
for
supper
it
was
not
yet
but
vrouw
vedder
was
always
ahead
of
the
clock
with
the
work
kit
and
kat
had
a
pan
of
water
and
were
teaching
their
ducklings
to
swim
they
each
had
one
little
fat
duckling
of
their
very
own
the
ducklings
squawked
when
kit
lifted
them
over
the
edge
of
the
pan
into
the
water
do
do
that
kit
said
kat
the
ducklings
do
like
it
you
did
like
it
when
you
fell
into
the
water
did
you
but
i
not
a
duck
said
kit
well
anyway
they
tired
and
want
to
go
to
their
mother
said
kat
let
do
something
else
i
tell
you
what
let
go
out
to
the
garden
and
help
father
get
the
boat
loaded
for
market
all
right
said
kit
may
we
mother
yes
said
vrouw
vedder
and
you
may
ask
father
if
he
will
take
you
to
market
with
him
if
it
fair
tell
him
i
said
you
could
ask
oh
goody
goody
said
kit
and
kat
both
at
once
and
they
ran
as
fast
as
their
wooden
shoes
would
take
them
out
into
the
garden
they
found
their
father
cutting
cabbages
and
gathering
them
into
piles
he
was
stopping
to
light
his
pipe
when
they
reached
him
o
father
said
kit
and
kat
both
together
may
we
go
on
the
boat
to
market
with
you
morning
mother
said
we
might
ask
father
vedder
blew
two
puffs
from
his
pipe
without
answering
we
help
you
load
the
boat
said
kit
yes
said
kat
i
can
carry
a
cabbage
i
can
carry
two
said
kit
we
both
be
good
said
kat
very
well
said
father
at
last
we
see
how
you
work
and
morning
if
it
fair
i
see
but
you
must
go
to
bed
early
because
you
have
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
if
you
go
with
me
now
you
each
take
a
cabbage
and
run
along
father
vedder
went
back
to
his
work
kit
and
kat
ran
to
the
kat
took
one
and
kit
took
two
just
to
show
that
he
could
when
father
says
see
he
always
means
kat
said
to
kit
perhaps
it
seems
queer
to
you
that
they
should
go
to
market
in
a
boat
but
it
did
seem
queer
at
all
to
the
twins
your
see
in
holland
there
are
a
great
many
canals
they
cross
the
fields
like
roadways
of
water
and
that
is
what
they
really
are
little
canals
open
into
big
ones
and
big
ones
go
clear
to
the
sea
it
is
very
easy
for
farmers
to
load
their
vegetables
for
market
right
on
a
boat
they
can
pull
the
boat
out
into
the
big
canal
and
then
away
they
go
to
sell
their
produce
in
the
town
the
canals
flow
through
the
towns
too
and
make
water
streets
where
boats
go
up
and
down
as
carriages
go
here
the
twins
and
their
father
worked
like
beavers
washing
the
vegetables
and
packing
them
in
baskets
until
their
good
old
boat
was
filled
with
cabbages
and
onions
and
beets
and
carrots
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
by
that
time
it
was
nearly
dark
and
they
were
all
three
very
hungry
so
they
went
home
they
found
that
mother
vedder
had
made
buttermilk
porridge
for
supper
the
twins
loved
buttermilk
porridge
they
each
ate
three
bowls
of
it
and
then
their
mother
put
them
to
bed
this
is
a
picture
of
the
bed
it
opened
like
a
cupboard
right
into
the
kitchen
and
it
was
like
going
to
bed
on
a
shelf
in
the
pantry
the
very
next
thing
the
twins
knew
it
was
morning
and
there
was
vrouw
vedder
calling
to
them
it
market
day
and
the
sun
is
almost
up
come
kit
and
kat
if
you
want
to
go
with
father
she
said
the
twins
bounced
out
like
two
rubber
balls
they
ate
some
breakfast
and
then
ran
to
the
boat
father
was
there
before
them
he
helped
them
into
the
boat
and
put
them
both
on
one
seat
and
told
them
to
sit
still
then
he
got
in
and
took
the
pole
and
pushed
off
vrouw
vedder
stood
on
the
canal
bank
to
see
them
pass
be
good
children
mind
father
and
do
get
lost
she
called
after
them
kit
and
kat
were
very
busy
all
the
way
to
town
looking
at
the
things
to
be
seen
on
each
side
of
the
canal
it
was
so
early
in
the
morning
that
the
grass
was
all
shiny
with
dew
black
and
white
cows
were
eating
the
rich
green
grass
and
a
few
laborers
were
already
in
the
fields
they
passed
little
groups
of
farm
buildings
their
roofs
shining
in
the
morning
sun
and
the
windmills
threw
long
long
shadows
across
the
fields
the
blue
blossoms
of
the
flax
nodded
to
them
from
the
canal
bank
and
once
they
saw
a
stork
fly
over
a
mossy
green
roof
to
her
nest
on
the
chimney
with
a
frog
in
her
mouth
they
went
under
bridges
and
by
little
canals
that
opened
into
the
main
canal
they
passed
so
close
to
some
of
the
houses
that
kit
and
kat
could
see
the
white
curtains
blowing
in
the
windows
and
the
pots
of
red
geraniums
standing
on
the
sill
in
one
house
the
family
waved
their
hands
to
kit
and
kat
from
the
breakfast
table
and
a
little
farther
on
they
passed
a
woman
who
was
washing
clothes
in
the
canal
other
boats
filled
with
vegetables
and
flowers
of
all
colors
passed
them
and
they
were
going
to
market

great
many
boats
in
the
canal
here
and
people
calling
back
and
forth
to
each
other
from
them
kit
and
kat
saw
a
boat
that
the
captain
family
lived
in
it
was
like
a
floating
house
the
twins
thought
it
must
be
grand
to
live
on
a
boat
like
that
just
going
about
from
town
to
town
seeing
new
sights
every
day
we
should
never

all
said
kit
they
wished
their
own
boat
were
big
enough
to
move
about
in
but
father
told
them
they
must
sit
very
very
still
all
the
time
there
were
houses
on
each
side
of
the
canal
in
the
town
and
people
were
clattering
along
over
the
pavement
in
their
wooden
shoes
the
was
an
open
square
in
the
middle
of
the
town
it
had
little
booths
and
stalls
all
about
it
the
farmers
brought
their
fresh
vegetables
and
flowers
or
whatever
they
had
to
sell
into
these
stalls
and
then
sat
there
waiting
for
customers
kit
and
kat
helped
their
father
to
unload
the
boat
then
they
sat
down
on
a
box
and
father
gave
them
each
some
bread
and
cheese
to
eat
for
they
were
hungry

put
the
cheese
between
slices
of
bread
and
took
bites

stalls
to
see
what
they
would
buy
for

a
large
woman
with
a
big

set
forth
on
their
travels
to
see
the
world
they
each
held

hand
and
with
the
other
hand
they
held
on
to
each
other
the
world

very
large
said
kit
and
kat
they
saw
all
sorts
of
strange
things
in
the
market
there
were
tables
piled
high
with
flowers
there
was
a
stall
full
of
birds
in
cages
singing
away
with
all
their
might
one
cage
had
five
little
birds
in
it
sitting
in
a
row
o
kit
cried
kat

the
birds
they
asked
the
woman
if
the
birds
cost
two
cents
and
she
said
no
my
angels
they
cost
fifty
cents
you
see
now
that
the
twins
could
count
ten
they
knew
they
get
the
birds
for
two
cents
when
they
cost
fifty
so
they
went
to
the
next
place
there
there
were
chickens
and
ducks
for
sale
but
the
twins
had
plenty
of
those
at
home
there
were
stalls
and
stalls
of
vegetables
just
like
father
and
there
were
booths
where
meat
and
fish
and
wood
and
peat
were
sold
but
the

could
find
anything
they
wanted
that
cost
exactly
two

held
up
their
money
there
on
the
counter

a
whole
row
of
nicholas

with
currant
eyes

the

seat
holding
tight
to
their
dolls
which
were
growing
rather
sticky
the
boat
was
so
light
that
they
went
home
from

much
more
quickly
than
they
had
come
and
it
did
not
seem
long
before
they
saw

half
hidden
among

going
on
in
the
world

shining
through
the
little
panes
of
the
kitchen
window
making
square
patches
of
light
on
the
floor
the
kettle
was
singing
on

father
vedder
did
not
look
at
kit
and
kat
at

he
just
puffed
away
at
his
pipe
and
said
to
himself
if
there
are
any
twins
anywhere
that
want
to
go
to
church
with
me
they
better
get
dressed
and

kit
and
kat
tumbled
out
of
the
cupboard
at
once
vrouw
vedder
came
to
help
them
dress
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
petticoats
she
put
on
kat
but
it
was
ever
so
many
and
over
them
all
she
put
a
skirt
of
plaid
there
was
a
waist
of
a
different
color
and
over
that
a
kerchief
with
bright
red
roses
on
it
and
over
the
skirt
she
put
a
new
clean
apron

dressed
very
splendidly
too
he
had
full
baggy
trousers
of
velveteen
that
reached
to
his
ankles
and
a
jacket
that
buttoned
with
big
silver
buttons
his
trousers
had
pockets
in
them
kit
and
kat
both
wore
stockings
which
vrouw
vedder
had
knit
and
their
best
shoes
of
stout
leather
when
they
were
all
dressed
vrouw
vedder
stood
them
up
side
by
side
and
had
them
turn
around
slowly
to
be
sure
they
were
all
right
now
see
that
you
behave
well
in
meeting
she
said
sit
up
straight
look
at
the
dominie
and
do
not
whisper
yes
mother
said
kit
and
kat
then
she
tied
a
big
apron
over
each
of
them
and
gave
them
each
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
while
they
were
eating
it
father
vedder
went
out
and
looked
at
the
pigs
and
chickens
and
ducks
and
geese
and
smoked
his
pipe
when
he
came
in
kit
and
kat
were
quite
ready
vrouw
vedder
had
tied
on
kat
little
cap
and
put
kit
hat
on
she
kissed
them
and
they
were
off
one
on
each
side
of
father
vedder
holding
tight
to
his
hands
mother
vedder
looked
after
them
proudly
from
the
doorway
she
did
not
go
to
church
that
day
they
walked
slowly
along
the
roadway
in
the
bright
sunshine
many
of
their
neighbors
and
friends
all
dressed
in
their
best
were
walking
to
church
too
father
vedder
and
kit
and
kat
went
a
little
out
of
their
way
in
order
to
pass
a
large
windmill
that
was
swinging
its
arms
around
and
creaking
out
a
kind
of
sleepy
windmill
song
this
is
the
song
it
seemed
to
sing
around
and
around
and
around
i
go
sometimes
fast
and
sometimes
slow
i
pump
the
water
and
grind
the
grain
the
marshy
fields
of
the
lowlands
drain
i
harness
the
wind
to
turn
my
mill
around
and
around
and
around
with
a
will
perhaps
it
was
listening
to
the
windmill
song
that
made
kat
say
why
do
we
have
windmills
father
kit
and
kat
said
why
every
few
steps
on
that
walk
you
see
they
did
often
have
their
father
all
to
themselves
to
ask
questions
of
why
what
a
little
dutch
girl
said
father
vedder
not
to
know
what
windmills
are
for
they
pump
the
water
out
of
the
fields
to
be
sure
do
you
know
how
wet
the
fields
are
sometimes
if
we
did
keep
pumping
the
water
out
they
would
be
so
wet
we
could
not
make
gardens
at
all
does
the
wind
pump
the
water
asked
kat
of
course
it
does
goosie
girl
and
grinds
the
grain
too
the
wind
blows
against
the
great
arms
and
turns
them
round
and
round
that
works
the
pumps
and
the
pumps
suck
the
water
out
of
the
fields
and
it
is
poured
out
into
the
canals
if
it
were
for
the
good
old
windmills
working
away
who
knows
but
the
water
would
get
the
best
of
us
some
day
and
cover
up
all
our
land
would
the
dykes
keep
out
the
sea
asked
kit
suppose
the
dykes
should
break
said
father
vedder
even
one
little
break
can
let
in
lots
of
water
the
dykes
have
to
be
watched
day
and
night
all
the
time
and
the
least
bit
of
a
hole
stopped
up
right
away
so
it
ca
grow
any
bigger
and
let
in
the
sea
oh
dear
kat
said
what
a
leaky
country
she
ran
near
the
mill
and
let
the
wind
from
the
fans
blow
her
hair
and
the
white
wings
on
her
cap
as
the
great
fans
swung
near
the
ground
kit
jumped
up
and
caught
hold
of
one
it
lifted
him
right
off
the
ground
as
it
swung
around
and
in
a
minute
he
was
dangling
high
in
the
air
jump
jump
quick
shouted
father
vedder
kit
let
go
and
dropped
to
the
ground
just
in
time
in
another
minute
he
would
have
been
carried
clear
over
as
it
was
he
sat
down
very
hard
on
the
ground
and
had
to
have
the
dirt
brushed
off
of
his
sunday
clothes
i
am
surprised
at
you
father
vedder
said
while
he
brushed
him
you
are
too
small
to
swing
on
windmills
and
besides
it
is
the
sabbath
day
do
you
ever
do
it
again
until
you
are
big
enough
to
be
called
christopher
sitting
down
so
hard
in
the
dirt
had
hurt
kit
a
little
bit
and
scared
him
a
good
deal
so
he
said
no
father
then
they
walked
all
around
the
mill
they
peeped
inside
a
door
which
was
open
and
saw
the
pumps
working
away
yes
said
father
vedder
it
is
nip
and
tuck
between
wind
and
water
in
holland
let
us
sit
down
here
on
the
canal
bank
in
the
sunshine
and
i
will
tell
you
what
hard
work
has
to
be
done
to
keep
this
good
land
of
ours
and
it
is
a
good
land
we
should
be
thankful
for
it
just
see
the
rich
green
meadows
over
there
with
the
cows
grazing
in
them
father
vedder
pointed
to
the
beautiful
fields
across
the
canal
the
grass
is
so
rich
and
fresh
that
the
cows
here
give
more
milk
than
any
other
cows
in
the
whole
world
that
what
mother
says
said
kat
the
holland
butter
and
cheese
are
famous
everywhere
went
on
father
vedder
and
we
have
all
the
good
milk
we
want
to
drink
besides
the
dutch
gardens
too
are
the
finest
in
the
world
and
ours
is
one
of
the
best
of
dutch
gardens
is
it
father
said
kit
it
a
very
good
garden
said
father
vedder
proudly
no
one
can
raise
better
onions
and
cabbage
and
carrots
than
i
can
and
the
dutch
bulbs
our
tulips
and
hyacinths
make
the
whole
world
bloom
holland
is
really
the
greatest
country
there
is
is
it
said
kit
well
not
in
point
of
size
perhaps
father
vedder
admitted
but
in
pluck
my
boy
it
is
did
you
know
that
sometimes
people
call
holland
the
land
of
pluck
i
do
see
why
said
kat
i
dutch
but
i
afraid
of
lots
of
things
i
afraid
of
spiders
and
of
cross
geese
and
of
falling
into
the
water
you
a
girl
if
you
are
dutch
said
kit
boys
are
always
pluckier
than
girls
are
they
father
really
plucky
people
never
boast
said
father
vedder
kit
looked
the
other
way
and
dug
the
toe
of
his
shoe
into
the
dirt
kat
snuggled
up
to
her
father
and
sniffed
at
kit
so
there
kit
was
all
she
said
there
pluck
enough
to
go
round
said
father
vedder
mildly
and
we
all
need
it
boys
and
girls
and
men
and
women
too
it
was
pluck
that
made
holland
and
it
pluck
that
keeps
her
from
slipping
back
into
the
sea
how
did
pluck
make
holland
asked
kit
there
was
any
holland
in
the
first
place
father
vedder
answered
there
were
only
some
marshes
and
some
lands
under
water
but
people
built
a
wall
of
earth
around
these
flats
and
then
they
pumped
out
the
water
from
the
space
inside
the
wall
and
made
canals
through
the
land
and
drained
it
and
after
all
that
work
we
have
our
rich
fields
how
does
pluck
keep
them
asked
kat
the
dykes
have
to
be
watched
and
mended
all
the
time
said
father
vedder
and
the
windmills
have
to
work
and
work
to
keep
the
fields
drained
no
one
can
be
lazy
in
holland
each
one
has
to
work
well
for
what
he
gets
if
holland
should
grow
lazy
she
would
soon
be
back
again
in
the
zuyder
zee
so
my
children
you
see
you
must
learn
well
and
work
hard
and
that
is
all
my
sermon
it
is
a
better
sermon
than
the
dominie
will
preach
i
know
said
kat
tut
tut
you
must
never
say
such
things
said
father
vedder
he
got
up
and
held
out
his
hands
to
the
twins
come
we
must
walk
along
or
we
shall
be
late
for
church
he
said
here
comes
the
dominie
now
there
indeed
was
the
dominie
kit
and
kat
knew
him
well
no
one
else
dressed
as
he
did
he
wore
a
high
silk
hat
and
long
black
coat
and
trousers
such
as
city
people
wear
as
he
came
along
the
road
all
the
people
bowed
respectfully
the
little
boys
took
off
their
caps
and
the
little
girls
bobbed
a
courtesy
kit
and
kat
bobbed
and
courtesied
too
and
the
dominie
smiled
at
them
and
laid
his
hand
on
kit
head
i
wish
he
come
to
see
us
again
said
kit
after
the
dominie
had
passed
by
father
vedder
was
pleased
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
love
your
pastor
my
son
he
said
well
said
kit
i
do
really
like
him
so
very
much
because
we
have
to
be
washed
and
recite
the
catechism
and
mind
all
our
manners
when
he
comes
but
mother
always
has
such
good
things
to
eat
when
the
dominie
comes
does
she
kat
cake
and
preserves
and
everything
if
it
were
for
the
catechism
and
such
things
it
would
be
something
like
nicholas
day
sighed
kat
but
the
dominie
never
forgets
and
last
time
i
could
tell
what
saving
grace
was
the
cakes
are
good
but
good
dutch
boys
and
girls
always
learn
their
catechism
well
said
father
vedder
then
they
are
glad
to
see
the
good
dominie
as
well
as
the
cakes
now
no
more
chatter
here
is
a
penny
for
each
of
you
to
put
in
the
bag
when
it
is
passed
he
gave
them
each
a
penny
kit
put
his
in
his
pocket
kat
did
have
a
pocket
so
she
held
hers
tight
in
her
hand
at
the
church
door
they
met
grandfather
and
grandmother
grandfather
looked
very
fine
indeed
in
his
black
clothes
and
grandmother
was
all
dressed
up
in
her
best
black
dress
with
a
fresh
white
cap
and
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
she
carried
a
large
psalm
book
with
golden
clasps
in
one
hand
and
a
scent
bottle
in
the
other
she
had
some
peppermints
too
kit
and
kat
smelled
them
they
all
went
into
the
church
together
and
an
old
woman
led
them
to
their
seats
kit
and
kat
sat
one
on
each
side
of
grandmother
grandfather
and
father
vedder
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
church
with
all
the
rest
of
the
men
you
must
sit
very
still
and
look
straight
before
you
said
grandmother
kit
remembered
the
peppermints
and
sat
up
like
a
soldier
so
did
kat
pretty
soon
the
schoolmaster
came
in
and
went
up
into
the
pulpit
he
read
a
chapter
from
the
bible
and
then
the
dominie
stood
up
in
the
pulpit
and
began
to
preach
he
preached
a
long
time
kit
and
kat
tried
very
hard
to
sit
still
just
as
grandmother
had
said
but
pretty
soon
their
heads
began
to
nod
grandmother
gave
them
each
a
peppermint
they
waked
up
for
a
minute
but
the
dominie
kept
right
on
preaching
until
they
were
both
sound
asleep
with
their
heads
on
shoulders
one
on
each
side
and
if
they
had
been
awake
to
see
they
might
have
thought
that
grandmother
took
a
nap
too
the
sermon
was
so
very
long
that
a
great
many
people
went
to
sleep
so
by
and
by
the
dominie
said
we
will
all
sing
the
psalm
everybody
woke
up
grandmother
opened
the
great
golden
clasps
of
her
psalm
book
and
stood
up
with
all
the
rest
of
the
people
she
stood
up
quickly
so
that
no
one
would
think
she
had
been
asleep
she
forgot
that
the
twins
were
asleep
too
with
their
heads
on
her
shoulders
that
was
why
when
she
got
up
kit
and
kat
fell
against
each
other
and
bumped
their
heads
they
forgot
that
they
were
in
church
they
said
ow
both
together
and
kat
began
to
cry
but
grandmother
said
sh
sh
and
gave
them
each
a
peppermint
and
that
made
them
feel
much
better
pretty
soon
the
schoolmaster
came
along
with
a
little
bag
on
the
end
of
a
long
stick
he
passed
it
to
each
person
kit
and
kat
each
put
in
a
penny
though
kit
had
a
hard
time
to
get
his
out
of
his
pocket
but
grandmother
was
so
upset
about
the
twins
getting
bumped
that
she
forgot
and
put
in
a
peppermint
instead
when
church
was
over
and
they
were
out
on
the
street
again
grandmother
said
now
you
are
coming
home
with
me
to
stay
all
night
really
and
truly
said
the
twins
and
may
we
go
with
grandfather
to
carry
the
milk
in
the
morning
yes
said
grandfather
and
kit
may
drive
the
dogs
kit
jumped
right
up
and
down
he
was
so
happy
even
if
it
was
sunday
may
i
too
may
i
too
asked
kat
you
are
a
girl
said
grandfather
you
may
ride
in
the
wagon
oh
i
wish
would
come
right
away
said
kat
then
kit
and
kat
said
to
father
vedder
and
went
home
with
grandmother
and
grandfather
they
lived
on
a
little
street
in
the
town
where
the
houses
stood
in
a
row
close
together
the
houses
were
built
of
brick
and
had
wooden
shutters
at
the
windows
and
they
were
so
clean
they
shone
in
the
sun
this
is
a
picture
of
grandmother
house
and
of
grandmother
and
kit
and
kat
going
in
the
door
opened
right
into
the
kitchen
grandmother
put
away
her
shawl
and
psalm
book
and
scent
bottle
as
soon
as
she
was
home
then
she
put
on
a
big
apron
and
drew
out
the
round
table
she
boiled
the
kettle
and
made
coffee
and
when
it
was
done
she
set
the
coffee
pot
on
a
pretty
little
porcelain
stove
on
the
table
to
keep
hot
she
got
out
bread
and
cheese
and
smoked
beef
and
best
of
all
a
plate
of
little
cakes
then
they
all
four
sat
down
to
eat
i
will
not
tell
you
how
many
cakes
kit
and
kat
ate
but
it
was
a
good
many
after
dinner
grandmother
put
away
the
things
and
kat
helped
her
kit
sat
beside
grandfather
in
the
doorway
while
he
smoked
pretty
soon
grandfather
said
bring
me
my
accordeon
kit
kit
ran
to
the
press
in
the
corner
he
knew
where
the
accordeon
was
kept
then
grandfather
took
the
accordeon
tipped
his
head
back
shut
his
eyes
and
began
to
play
beating
time
with
one
foot
kat
heard
the
music
and
came
out
too
she
and
kit
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
one
on
each
side
of
grandfather
to
listen
grandfather
played
six
tunes
then
grandmother
said
why
do
we
go
to
the
woods
to
hear
the
band
play
no
reason
at
all
said
grandfather
so
very
soon
they
were
on
their
way
to
a
grove
on
the
edge
of
the
town
in
the
grove
a
band
was
playing
and
just
as
the
twins
and
grandfather
and
grandmother
came
up
it
began
to
play
the
national
hymn
of
holland
all
the
people
began
to
sing
there
were
a
great
many
people
in
the
grove
and
they
all
sang
as
aloud
as
they
could
so
there
was
a
great
sound
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
kit
and
kat
all
sang
too
for
they
all
knew
every
word
of
the
hymn
this
is
what
they
sang
let

our

now
while
the
people
were
singing
with
all
their
might
and
the
band
was
playing
and
kit
and
kat
were
having
the
most
beautiful
time
they
had
ever
had
in
their
whole
lives
what
do
you
think
happened
down
the
long
drive
through
the
trees
came
a
great
splendid
carriage
drawn
by
a
pair
of
beautiful
white
horses
with
wavy
white
tails
and
manes
there
were
two
soldiers
on
horseback
riding
in
front
of
the
carriage
and
the
driver
of
the
carriage
was
dressed
in
blue
and
orange
livery
the
carriage
was
open
and
in
it
sat
a
beautiful
smiling
young
lady
beside
her
sat
her
husband
and
a
nurse
in
the
other
seat
held
a
baby
in
her
arms
when
the
people
saw
the
carriage
and
the
lady
they
waved
their
caps
and
shouted
long
live
the
queen
look
look
kit
and
kat
said
grandfather
it
is
your
dear
queen
wilhelmina
and
prince
henry
and
the
little
princess
wave
your
hands
kit
and
kat
waved
with
all
their
might
but
they
were
so
short
and
the
people
crowded
beside
the
driveway
so
that
neither
of
them
could
see
then
grandfather
caught
kit
and
lifted
him
up
high
and
grandmother
did
the
same
with
kat
it
was
fine
to
be
up
so
high
kit
and
kat
could
see
everything
better
than
anyone
else
there
and
when
the
carriage
came
by
the
queen
saw
kit
and
kat
she
smiled
at
them
and
the
nurse
held
the
little
princess
up
high
for
them
to
see
kit
and
kat
threw
kisses
to
the
little
princess
and
the
princess
waved
her
baby
hand
to
kit
and
kat
and
then
they
were
all
gone
like
a
bright
dream
but
the
soldiers
were
better
to
see
even
than
queens
kit
thought
kat
thought
the
baby
any
baby
was
nicer
than
either
when
the
carriage
was
out
of
sight
grandfather
and
grandmother
set
the
twins
down
on
the
ground
everyone
began
to
talk
about
the
queen
about
how
sweet
she
was
and
how
good
and
the
band
played
and
everybody
was
as
happy
as
they
could
possibly
be
by
and
by
it
was
time
to
go
home
for
grandfather
said
dutch
girls
and
boys
must
learn
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
especially
twins
that
are
going
out
with
the
milk
cart
so
they
went
back
to
grandfather
winkle
house
and
grandmother
put
them
to
bed
in
a
little
cupboard
like
their
own
at
home
after
they
had
had
some
supper
and
the
last
thing
kat
said
that
night
was
o
kit
just
to
think
that
we
saw
the
queen
and
the
soldiers
and
the
queen
baby
and
we
are
going
to
drive
in
the
milk
cart
what
a
beautiful
world
it
is
just
as
they
were
dropping
off
to
sleep
they
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
street
clap
clap
clap
it
sounded
eight
times
there
goes
the
klapper
man
said
grandmother
winkle
eight
and
time
all
honest
folk
were
abed
v
the
day
they
drove
the
milk
cart
the
next
morning
kit
and
kat
woke
up
very
early
without
any
calling
them
you
see
they
were
afraid
they
would
be
too
late
to
go
with
the
milk
cart
but
grandfather
winkle
had
only
just
gone
out
to
get
the
milk
ready
and
they
had
plenty
of
time
to
dress
while
grandmother
got
breakfast
grandmother
helped
with
the
buttons
and
the
hard
parts
grandmother
winkle
kitchen
was
quite
like
the
kitchen
at
home
only
a
little
nicer
it
had
red
tiles
on
the
floor
and
it
had
ever
so
many
blue
plates
hanging
around
on
the
walls
and
standing
on
edge
in
a
row
on
the
shelves
there
was
a
with
a
bright
brass
cover
hanging
on
the
wall
and
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
pillows
and
the
coverlet
on
the
best
bed
grandmother
winkle
had
embroidered
those
all
herself
and
she
was
very
proud
of
them
when
she
had
company
she
always
drew
the
curtains
back
so
that
her
beautiful
bed
would
be
seen
she
said
that
kit
and
kat
were
company
and
she
always
left
the
curtains
open
when
they
came
to
visit
her
when
the
twins
were
all
dressed
grandmother
said
mercy
sakes
you
have
on
your
best
clothes
now
that
just
like
a
man
to
promise
to
take
you
out
in
your
best
clothes
in
a
milk
wagon
whatever
was
grandfather
thinking
about
kit
and
kat
thought
she
was
going
to
say
that
they
could
go
so
they
dug
their
knuckles
in
their
eyes
and
began
to
cry
but
they
had
got
farther
than
the
first
whimper
when
grandmother
said
well
well
we
must
fix
it
somehow
do
cry
now
that
a
good
kit
and
kat
so
the
twins
took
their
knuckles
out
of
their
eyes
and
began
to
smile
grandmother
went
to
the
press
and
brought
out
two
aprons
one
was
a
very
small
apron
it
would
reach
to
kit
knees
but
she
put
it
on
him
and
tied
it
around
his
waist
this
was
your
uncle
jan
when
he
was
a
little
boy
she
said
pretty
small
but
it
will
help
some
kit
wished
that
uncle
jan
had
taken
it
with
him
when
he
went
to
america
but
he
did
say
so
then
grandmother
took
another
apron
out
of
the
press
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
there
a
long
time
kat
you
must
wear
this
she
said
it
was
your
mother
when
she
was
a
little
girl
now
this
apron
was
all
faded
and
it
had
patches
on
it
of
different
kinds
of
cloth
kat
looked
at
her
best
dress
then
she
looked
at
the
apron
then
she
thought
about
the
milk
cart
she
wondered
if
she
wanted
to
go
in
the
milk
cart
badly
enough
to
wear
that
apron
over
her
sunday
dress
she
stuck
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
looked
sidewise
at
grandmother
winkle
grandmother
did
say
a
word
she
just
looked
firm
and
held
up
the
apron
very
soon
kat
came
slowly
very
slowly
and
grandmother
buttoned
the
apron
up
behind
and
that
was
the
end
of
that
the
twins
could
hardly
eat
any
breakfast
they
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
the
last
spoonful
and
grandfather
winkle
had
finished
his
coffee
they
ran
out
into
the
place
where
the
dogs
were
kept
to
help
grandfather
harness
them
there
were
two
black
and
white
dogs
their
names
were
peter
and
paul
the
wagon
was
small
just
the
right
size
for
the
dogs
and
it
was
painted
blue
the
bright
brass
cans
full
of
milk
were
already
in
and
there
was
a
little
seat
for
kat
to
sit
on
when
the
last
strap
was
fastened
grandfather
lifted
kat
up
and
set
her
on
the
seat
she
held
on
with
both
hands
then
grandfather
gave
the
lines
to
kit
and
a
little
stick
for
a
whip
and
told
him
to
walk
slowly
along
beside
the
dogs
he
told
him
to
be
sure
not
to
let
go
of
the
lines
grandfather
walked
behind
carrying
some
milk
cans
grandmother
stood
in
the
door
to
see
them
off
and
as
they
started
away
kat
took
one
hand
off
the
cart
long
enough
to
wave
it
to
her
then
she
held
on
again
for
the
bricks
in
the
pavement
made
the
cart
joggle
a
good
deal
we
must
go
first
to
vrouw
de
vet
grandfather
called
out
she
takes
one
quart
of
milk
go
slowly
at
first
kit
went
slowly
but
pretty
soon
there
was
a
great
rattling
behind
him
and
hans
hite
a
boy
he
knew
drove
right
past
him
with
his
dog
cart
he
drove
fast
and
as
he
passed
kit
he
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
called
out
milk
for
sale
milk
for
sale
a
milk
cart
drawn
by
a
pair
of
snails
kit
forgot
all
about
going
slowly
get
up
he
said
to
the
dogs
and
he
touched
them
with
his
long
stick
peter
and
paul
got
up
they
jumped
forward
and
began
to
run
kit
ran
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
go
beside
the
dogs
holding
the
lines
but
the
dogs
had
four
legs
apiece
and
kit
had
only
two
so
you
see
he
could
keep
up
very
well
kat
began
to
scream
the
moment
that
peter
and
paul
began
to
run
the
dogs
thought
that
something
that
made
a
dreadful
noise
was
after
them
and
they
ran
faster
than
ever
you
see
grandfather
winkle
never
in
the
world
screamed
like
that
and
peter
and
paul
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
so
they
ran
and
ran
and
ran
kat
held
on
the
best
she
could
but
she
bounced
up
ever
so
far
in
the
air
every
time
the
cart
struck
a
bump
in
the
street
so
did
the
milk
cans
and
when
they
came
down
again
the
milk
splashed
out
kat
did
always
come
down
in
the
same
spot
all
the
spots
were
hard
so
it
did
really
matter
much
which
one
she
struck
as
she
came
down
but
kat
did
think
about
that
she
just
screamed
and
peter
and
paul
ran
and
ran
and
kit
ran
and
ran
until
he
could
run
any
more
he
just
sat
down
hard
on
the
pavement
and
slid
along
but
he
did
let
go
of
the
lines
when
kit
sat
down
it
jerked
the
dogs
so
hard
that
they
stopped
suddenly
but
kat
did
stop
she
went
right
on
she
flew
out
over
the
front
of
the
cart
and
landed
on
the
ground
among
all
of
peter
and
paul
legs
then
she
stopped
going
but
she
did
stop
screaming
and
though
kit
was
a
boy
he
screamed
some
too
then
peter
and
paul
pointed
their
noses
up
in
the
air
and
began
to
howl
way
back
ever
so
far
grandfather
was
coming
along
as
fast
as
he
could
but
that
was
very
fast
all
the
doors
on
the
street
flew
open
and
all
the
good
housewives
came
clattering
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
they
picked
kat
up
and
told
her
not
to
cry
and
wiped
her
eyes
with
their
aprons
and
stood
kit
on
his
feet
and
patted
the
dogs
and
pretty
soon
peter
and
paul
stopped
barking
and
kit
and
kat
stopped
screaming
and
then
it
was
time
to
find
out
what
had
really
happened
neither
of
the
twins
had
any
broken
bones
the
good
housewives
wiggled
all
their
arms
and
legs
and
felt
of
their
bones
to
see
but
shocking
things
had
happened
nevertheless
kat
had
torn
a
great
hole
in
the
front
of
her
best
dress
and
kit
had
worn
two
round
holes
in
the
seat
of
his
sunday
clothes
where
he
slid
along
on
the
pavement
and
besides
that
the
milk
was
slopped
all
over
the
bottom
of
the
cart
just
then
grandfather
came
up
if
it
had
been
that
his
pipe
was
still
in
his
mouth
i
really
do
know
what
he
might
not
have
said
he
looked
at
the
cart
and
he
looked
at
the
twins
then
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
sternly
to
kit
why
did
you
do
as
i
told
you
i
did
said
kit
very
much
scared
you
told
me
to
be
sure
to
hold
tight
to
the
lines
and
i
did
i
never
let
go
once
yes
and
look
at
his
clothes
said
one
of
the
women
she
turned
him
around
and
showed
grandfather
the
holes
i
told
you
to
go
slowly
said
grandfather
now
look
at
the
cart
and
see
what
you
done
by
not
minding
spoiled
your
best
clothes
and
kat
and
spilled
the
milk
go
back
to
grandmother
but
i
could
mind
twice
at
one
time
said
kit
i
was
minding
about
not
letting
go
oh
dear
sobbed
kat
i
wish
we
were
four
and
a
half
feet
high
now
if
we
were
this
never
would
have
happened
grandfather
took
the
dogs
and
went
on
to
vrouw
de
vet
without
another
word
the
twins
took
each
other
hands
and
walked
back
to
house
quite
a
number
of
little
boys
and
girls
in
wooden
shoes
clattered
along
with
them
grandmother
heard
all
the
noise
and
ran
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
the
matter
laws
a
mercy
me
i
told
you
so
she
cried
the
moment
she
saw
them
look
at
your
clothes
see
how
you
torn
them
i
ca
see
the
holes
in
mine
said
kit
but
i
can
said
kat
and
then
all
the
children
talked
at
once
and
what
with
wooden
shoes
and
the
tongues
all
going
grandmother
clapped
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
noise
then
she
took
kit
and
kat
into
the
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
she
put
on
her
glasses
and
got
down
on
the
floor
so
she
could
see
better
then
she
turned
kit
and
kat
all
around
and
looked
at
the
holes
o
my
soul
she
said
she
took
off
the
aprons
and
the
torn
clothes
and
put
the
twins
to
bed
while
she
mended
she
got
out
a
pair
of
grandfather
oldest
velveteen
breeches
that
had
been
patched
a
great
deal
and
found
a
good
piece
to
patch
with
then
she
patched
the
holes
in
kit
breeches
so
neatly
that
one
had
to
look
very
carefully
indeed
to
see
that
there
had
ever
been
any
holes
there
at
all
then
she
patched
kat
dress
and
when
it
was
all
done
she
shook
it
out
and
said
to
herself
seems
to
me
those
twins
have
been
quiet
for
a
long
time
she
went
over
to
the
cupboard
bed
and
there
were
kit
and
kat
fast
asleep
with
their
cheeks
all
stained
with
tears
and
dirt
grandmother
winkle
kissed
them
kit
and
kat
woke
up
and
grandmother
dressed
them
in
their
sunday
clothes
again
and
washed
their
faces
and
made
them
feel
as
good
as
new
by
and
by
grandfather
winkle
came
home
from
going
about
with
the
milk
grandmother
winkle
scrubbed
the
cart
and
made
it
all
clean
again
and
by
noon
you
would
never
have
known
unless
you
had
looked
very
very
closely
much
more
closely
than
would
be
polite
that
anything
had
happened
to
the
twins
or
the
milk
cart
or
their
clothes
or
anything
after
they
had
eaten
their
dinner
and
the
dogs
were
rested
and
grandfather
had
smoked
his
pipe
he
said
kit
if
you
think
you
can
mind
i
will
take
you
and
kat
both
home
in
the
dog
cart
kit
and
kat
both
nodded
their
heads
very
hard
only
i
do
the
driving
myself
said
grandfather
winkle
and
he
did
he
put
kit
and
kat
both
on
the
seat
and
he
walked
slowly
beside
the
cart
they
went
out
on
the
road
beside
the
canal
toward
home
they
got
there
just
as
the
sun
was
getting
low
in
the
west
and
vrouw
vedder
was
going
out
to
feed
her
chickens
vi
the
day
they
got
their
skates
one
morning
when
kit
and
kat
ran
out
early
to
feed
their
ducklings
the
frost
nipped
their
noses
and
ears
it
getting
colder
every
day
very
soon
winter
will
come
kat
said
they
ran
down
to
the
canal
the
old
goose
and
the
gander
and
the
goslings
now
half
grown
were
standing
on
the
bank
looking
unhappy
there
was
a
thin
sheet
of
ice
all
over
the
canal
and
they
could
not
go
swimming
kit
took
a
stick
and
broke
the
ice
thin
sheets
of
it
like
pieces
of
broken
glass
were
soon
floating
about
and
the
old
goose
the
gander
and
all
the
goslings
went
down
the
bank
in
a
procession
into
the
water
they
swam
about
among
the
pieces
of
ice
for
a
while
but
it
was
so
cold
that
they
soon
came
up
on
the
bank
into
the
sun
again
and
wiggled
their
tails
to
shake
out
the
water
then
they
all
sat
down
in
the
sun
to
get
their
feet
warm
kit
and
kat
ran
up
and
down
the
road
and
played
tag
until
their
cheeks
were
red
and
they
were
warm
as
toast
then
they
ran
into
vrouw
warm
kitchen
the
kettle
was
singing
on
the
fire
and
there
was
a
smell
of
coffee
in
the
air
vrouw
vedder
gave
the
twins
some
in
a
large
cup
she
put
in
a
good
deal
of
milk
and
gave
them
each
a
piece
of
sugar
to
sweeten
it
with
is
it
sunday
asked
kat
on
sundays
they
sometimes
had
coffee
on
other
days
they
had
milk
no
said
vrouw
vedder
but
it
is
cold
and
i
thought
a
cup
of
coffee
would
warm
us
all
up
while
they
were
drinking
their
coffee
kit
and
kat
talked
about
the
ice
and
what
fun
they
would
have
with
their
sleds
on
the
canals
when
winter
came
i
tell
you
what
it
is
kat
said
kit

think

enough
to

hans
hite

much
bigger
than

am
and
he

last
winter
i

the
way
dutch
twins

twins
quite
soon
even
if
we
are
very
big
yet
not
big
enough
to
be

christopher
and
katrina
vrouw
vedder
was
heating

and
getting

scrubbing

was
going
to
clean

politely

a

beside

fireplace
and

the
stable
the
stable

really
a
part
of
the
house

get
the
ducklings
said
kit
they
can
be
twins
of
course
said
kat
they
are
anyway
so
kit
ran
out
and
brought
in
the
ducklings
they
were
so
tame
they
always
ran
to
kit
and
kat
when
they
saw
them
coming
they
were
almost
ducks
now
they
had
grown
so
big
let
give
the
twins
their
dinner
said
kat
so
she
got
some
grain
and
they
both
sat
down
on
a
little
box
and
held
the
ducks
in
their
laps
and
fed
them
from
their
hands
the
ducks
ate
greedily
you
have
very
bad
manners
said
kat
you
will
get
your
clothes
all
dirty
she
took
two
rags
and
tied
them
around
the
ducks
necks
for
bibs
the
ducks
did
not
like
bibs
they
quacked
now
do
say
anything
like
that
said
kat
you
must
do
just
as
you
are
told
and
not
spill
your
food
then
kit
got
some
water
and
a
spoon
and
gave
the
twins
a
drink
but
they
did
not
like
the
drink
either
now
we
must
put
them
to
sleep
said
kat
they
rocked
the
ducks
in
their
arms
but
the
ducks
squawked
dreadfully
what
bad
children
to
cry
so
said
kit
you
can
have
both
the
twins
and
he
gave
his
duck
to
kat
you
fix
a
bed
for
them
said
kat
so
kit
turned
up
the
box
they
had
been
sitting
on
and
put
some
hay
in
it
and
they
put
the
ducks
in
on
the
hay
pretty
soon
the
ducks
went
to
sleep
kit
and
kat
ran
away
to
play
out
of
doors
and
forgot
all
about
them
they
did
think
about
them
again
until
father
vedder
came
home
at
night
with
mevrouw
holstein
when
he
put
the
cow
into
the
stall
he
stumbled
over
the
box
it
was
rather
dark
in
the
stable
quack
quack
said
the
ducks
kit
and
kat
were
helping
father
put
the
cow
into
the
stall
and
get
some
hay
for
her
when
the
ducks
quacked
father
vedder
said
what
in
the
world
is
this
oh
our
twins
our
twins
cried
kit
and
kat
do
let
mevrouw
holstein
step
on
the
twins
father
vedder
pulled
out
the
box
kit
and
kat
each
took
a
duck
and
carried
it
out
to
the
poultry
house

a
great
care

kit
and
kat
now

the
time
to

kat
to
kit
that
night
when
father
vedder
had
finished
his
supper
and
was
lighting
his
pipe
you

politely
just
the
very
politest
way
you
can
they
went
and
stood
before
their
father
they
put
their
feet
together
kit

a
cold
cold
wind
it
blew
over
the
fields
and
over
the
canals
all
day
and
all
night
long
and
in
the
morning
when
the
twins
looked
out
the
canal
was
one
shining
roadway
of
ice
father
vedder
came
in
from
the
stable
with
a
great
pail
full
of
milk
winter

to
skate
before
nicholas
day

see
if
the
ice
is
strong
enough
to

said
father
vedder
and
he
went
right
down
to
the
canal
to
see
that
very
minute
when
he
came
in
he
said
yes
the
ice
is
strong
and
we
will
go
out
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
and
try
your
skates
vrouw
vedder
said
i
should
like

and
father
vedder
said
to
kit
and
kat
your
mother
used
to
be
the
finest
skater
in
the
whole
village
when
she
was
a
young
girl
you
must
not
let
her
beat
you
they
hurried
through
with
their
work
kit
and
kat
helped
then
they
all
put
on
their
heavy
shoes
and
wraps
took
their
skates
over
their
shoulders
and
started
for
the
canal
if
you
learn
to
skate
well
enough
we
will
take
you
to
town
before
the
feast
of
nicholas
said
father
vedder
but
it
comes
very
soon
he
put
on
his
own
skates
and
kit
and
the
mother
put
on
her
own
and
kat
i
sure
we
can
do
it
almost
right
away
said
kat
now
we
show
you
how
to
skate
said
father
vedder
he
stood
the
twins
up
on
the
ice
they
held
each
other
hands
they
were
afraid
to
move
father
vedder
took
mother
vedder
hand
see
he
said
like
this
and
away
they
went
like
two
swallows
skimming
over
the
ice
in
a
minute
they
were
ever
so
far
away
kit
and
kat
felt
lonesome
and
very
queer
when
they
saw
their
father
and
mother
flying
along
in
that
way
they
were
used
to
see
them
do
anything
but
work
and
move
about
slowly
it
looks
easy
said
kit
let
try
it
we
must
not
be
afraid
he
started
with
his
right
leg
pushing
it
out
a
little
in
front
of
him
but
it
was
very
strange
how
his
legs
acted
they
did
seem
to
belong
to
him
at
all
his
left
leg
tried
to
follow
his
right
just
as
it
ought
to
but
instead
it
slid
out
sidewise
and
knocked
against
skates
then
both
kat
feet
flew
up
and
she
sat
down
very
hard
on
the
ice
and
kit
came
down
on
top
of
her
they
tried
to
get
up
but
each
time
they
tried
their
feet
slid
away
from
them
oh
dear
said
kat
we
are
all
mixed
up
are
those
your
feet
or
mine
i
ca
tell
which
is
which
they
do
any
of
them
mind
said
kit
i
ca
stand
up
on
any
of
them
i
tried
them
all
we
just
have
to
wait
until
father
and
mother
come
back
and
pick
us
out
ice
is
quite
cold
to
sit
on
is
it
said
kat
soon
father
and
mother
vedder
came
skimming
back
again
when
they
saw
kit
and
kat
they
laughed
and
skated
to
them
picked
them
up
and
set
them
on
their
feet
now
i
take
kit
and
you
take
kat
said
vrouw
vedder
to
her
husband
and
they
be
skating
in
no
time
so
kat
father
took
her
hands
and
kit
took
hold
of
his
mother
and
they
started
off
at
first
the
twins
feet
did
behave
well
at
all
they
seemed
to
want
to
do
everything
they
could
to
bother
them
they
would
sprawl
way
apart
then
they
would
toe
in
and
run
into
each
other
many
times
kit
and
kat
would
have
fallen
if
father
and
mother
vedder
had
not
held
them
up
but
before
the
lesson
was
over
both
kit
and
kat
could
skate
a
little
bit
alone
see
this
is
the
way
said
vrouw
vedder
and
she
skated
around
in
a
circle
then
she
cut
a
figure
like
this
in
the
ice
then
father
vedder
did
a
figure
like
this
s
all
on
one
foot
my
said
kit
and
kat
i
think
our
parents
must
skate
the
best
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
said
kat
i
going
to
some
day
said
kit
so
i
said
kat
after
a
while
vrouw
vedder
said
it
time
to
go
home
not
too
much
the
first
time
so
they
all
went
back
home
with
their
cheeks
as
red
as
roses
and
their
noses
too
and
such
an
appetite
for
dinner
but
the
twins
were
a
little
lame
next
day
every
day
after
that
kit
and
kat
went
out
with
their
skates
to
the
ditches
and
tried
and
tried
to
skate
as
father
and
mother
did
they
did
so
want
to
skate
to
town
and
see
the
sights
before
the
feast
of
nicholas
they
worked
so
hard
that
in
a
week
they
could
skate
very
well
and
then
they
planned
a
surprise
for
their
mother
if
you
will
watch
at
the
window
you
see
a
great
sight
on
the
canal
very
soon
said
kit
to
his
mother
one
day
of
course
vrouw
vedder
had
the
least
idea
what
it
would
be
kit
and
kat
slipped
out
through
the
stable
and
ran
down
to
the
ditch
they
put
on
their
skates
and
skated
from
the
ditch
out
to
the
big
canal
vrouw
vedder
was
watching
at
the
window
soon
she
saw
kit
and
kat
go
flying
by
hand
in
hand
on
the
canal
they
waved
their
hands
to
her
vrouw
vedder
was
so
pleased
that
she
went
to
call
father
vedder
who
was
in
the
over
the
stable
come
and
see
kit
and
kat
she
cried
father
vedder
came
down
from
the
loft
and
looked
too
then
kit
cut
a
figure
like
this
s
and
kat
cut
one
like
this
the
round
spot
is
where
she
sat
down
hard
just
as
she
was
almost
around
when
they
came
into
the
kitchen
father
said
i
think
we
could
take
such
a
fine
pair
of
skaters
as
that
to
the
vink
with
us
on
our
way
to
town
the
ice
is
very
hard
and
thick
for
so
early
in
the
season
and
we
will
go
we
can
see
the
shops
too
nicholas
is
coming
and
the
shops
are
full
of
fine
things
said
vrouw
vedder
kit
and
kat
could
hardly
wait
for
to
come
they
polished
their
skates
and
made
everything
ready
what
do
you
suppose
the
vink
is
said
kat
to
kit
i
think
it
is
something
like
a
church
said
kit
you
do
know
what
a
vink
is
so
there
said
kat
i
think
something
to

then
kit
changed
the
subject

race
you
he
said

beat
said
kat
we
see
said
kit
the
next
day
they
started
all
four
quite
early
in
the
morning
vrouw
vedder
took
her
basket
on
her
arm
i
shall
want
to
buy
some
things
she
said
father
vedder
lighted
his
pipe
to
keep
my
nose
warm
he
said
then
they
all
went
down
to
the
canal
and
put
on
their
skates
kat
and
i
are
going
to
race
to
the
first
windmill
said
kit
i

you

said
father
vedder
and
i
get
a
cake
for
the
one
who

said
the
mother
one
two
three
away
they
flew
like
the
wind
father
and
mother
vedder
came
close
behind
kit
was
so
sure
he
would
beat
that
he
thought
he
would
show
off
a
little
he
went
zigzag
across
the
canal
once
or
twice
he
stopped
to
skate
in
curves
kat
did
stop
for
anything
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
windmill
and
she
skated
as
hard
as
she
could
they
were
getting
quite
near
the
mill
now
kit
stopped
playing
and
began
to
skate
as
fast
as
he
could
but
kat
had
got
the
start
of
him
i
soon
get
ahead
of
her
he
thought
she
a
girl
and
i
a
boy
he
struck
out
with
great
long
sweeps
as
long
as
such
short
legs
could
make
but
kat
kept
ahead
and
in
another
minute
there
she
was
at
the
windmill
quite
out
of
breath
and
pointing
her
finger
at
kit
i
beat
i
beat
she
said
well
i
could
have
beaten
if
i
wanted
to
said
kit
i
get
the
cake
said
kat
i
do
care
said
kit
but
kat
knew
that
he
did
i
give
you
a
piece
she
said
father
and
mother
vedder
came
along
then
and
when
kit
and
kat
were
rested
they
all
skated
for
a
long
time
without
saying
anything
then
father
vedder
said
proudly
to
his
wife
they
keep
up
as
well
as
anybody
were
there
ever
such
twins
and
mother
vedder
said
never

on
the
canal
men
and
women
and
children

skating
they
were
going
to
the
town
to
see
the
sights
too
one
woman
skated
by
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
one
man
was
smoking
a
long
pipe
and
his
wife
was
carrying
a
basket
of
eggs
but
the
man
and
woman
were
good
skaters
they
flew
along
laughing
and
no
one
could
get
near
enough
to
upset
them
as
they
came
nearer
to
the
town
kit
and
kat
saw
a
tent
near
the
place
where
one
canal
opened
into
another
a
man
stood
near
the
tent
he
put
his
hands
together
and
shouted
through
them
to
the
skaters
come
in

in
and
get
a
drink
of
warm
sweet
milk
on
your
way
to
the
vink

quite
near
the
vink
kat
said
i
do
wonder
what
it
looks
like

they
passed
another
tent
there
a
man
was
shouting

but
a
cent

said
i
promised
a
cake

the
race
we
go
in
here
and

so
they
went
to
the
tent
they
bought
two
cakes
and
each
ate
half
of
one
kat
broke
the
cakes
and
gave
them
to
the
others
because
she
won
the
race
when
they
had
eaten
the
cakes
they
skated
on
the
canals
grew
more
and
more
crowded
there
were
a
good
many
tents
flags
were
flying
and
the
whole
place
was
very
gay
at
last
they
saw
a
big
building
with
crowds
of
merry
skaters
about
it
many
people
were
going
in
and
out
there
the
vink
said
father
vedder
where
said
kit
and
kat
he
pointed
to
the
building
oh
said
kit
he
never
said
another
word
about
what
they
had
thought
it
was
like
soon
they
were
inside
the
vink
it
was
a
large
restaurant
there
were
many
little
tables
about
crowded
with
people
eating
and
drinking
father
vedder
found
a
table
and
they
all
sat
down
bring

pea

slowly
along
waiting
for

a
great
noise
up
the
street
there

shouts
and
the
clatter
of
wooden
shoes

in

he
had
a
long
white
beard
and
red
cheeks
and
long
robes
with
a
mitre
on
his
head
and
he
smiled
at
the
children
who
crowded
around
him
and
followed
him
in
a
noisy
procession
down
the
street
behind
nicholas
came
a
cart
filled
with
packages
of
all
sizes
the
children
were
all
shouting

father
vedder
but
you
must
fill
your
wooden
shoes
with
beans
or

good
horse

come
down
the
chimney
and
leave
something
in
them
worth
trying
kit
and
kat
were
in
a
hurry
to
get

there
first
it

so
they
all
went
to
a
waffle

like

just
what
we
wanted

kit

vrouw
vedder

a
little
song
and

kat
that

one
time
you

how
well
i
can
think
you
know
how
i
thought
about

van
der
kloot
cakes
but

twice
at
one
time
i
do
suppose
you

said
kat
but
anyway
i
sorry
about
my

then
vrouw
vedder
called
them
to

and
eat
their
breakfast
father
and
mother
vedder
sat
down
at
the
little
round
table
and
bowed
their
heads
kit
and
kat
stood
up
father
vedder
said
grace
and
then
they
ate
their
salt
herring
and
drank
their
coffee
and
kit
and
kat
had
coffee
too
because
it
was
nicholas
morning
it
was
snowing
when
after

kit
went
out
with
his
father
to
feed
the
chickens
and
the
pigs
and
to
see
that
the
cow
had
something
very
good
that
she
liked
to
eat
when
they
had
done
that
they
called
kat
and
she
helped
throw
out
some
grain
on
the
white
snow
so

have
a
feast

it
snowed
all
day
kit
and
kat
both
helped
their
mother
get
the
dinner

got
the
cabbage
and
the
onions
and
the
potatoes
ready
and
when
the
goose
was
hung
upon
the
fire
to
roast
they
watched
it
and
kept
it
spinning
around
on
the
spit
so
it
would
brown
evenly
by
and
by
the
kitchen
was
all
in
order
and
you
ca
think
how
clean
and
homelike
it
looked
the
brasses
all
around
the
room
had
little
flames
dancing
in
them
because
they
were
so
bright
and
shiny
everything
was
ready
for
the
nicholas
feast
the
goose
was
nearly
roasted
and
there
was
such
a
good
smell
of
it
in
the
air
after
a
while
there
was
a
great
stamping
of
feet
at
the
door
and
vrouw
vedder
ran
with
the
broom
to
brush
the
snow
off
grandfather
and
grandmother
who
had
skated
all
the
way
from
town
on
the
canal
when
they
were
warmed
and
dried
and
all
their
wraps
put
away
grandfather
and
grandmother
winkle
looked
around
the
pleasant
kitchen
and
grandmother
said
to
grandfather
our
neltje
is
certainly
a
good
neltje
was
vrouw
vedder
and
grandfather
said
there
only
one
better
one
my
dear
he
meant
grandmother
winkle
by
and
by
they
all
sat
down
to
dinner
and
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
good
it
was
it
makes
one
hungry
just
to
think
of
it
they
had
roast
goose
and
onions
and
turnips
and
cabbage
they
had
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
and
sweet
cakes
everything
except
the
flour
in
the
bread
we
raised
ourselves
said
vrouw
vedder
the
hens
gave
us
the
eggs
and
the
cow
the
butter
the
twins
helped
father
and
me
to
take
care
of
the
chickens
and
to
milk
the
cow
and
to
make
the
butter
so
it
is
our
very
own
nicholas
feast
that
we
are
eating
a
farmer
life
is
the
best
life
there
is
said
father
vedder
they
sat
a
long
time
at
the
table
and
grandfather
told
stories
about
when
he
was
a
boy
and
father
vedder
told
how
kit
and
kat
learned
to
skate
and
kit
and
kat
told
how
they
saw
nicholas
riding
on
a
white
horse
and
how
he
sent
them
the
very
things
they
wanted
and
they
all
enjoyed
themselves
very
much
after
dinner
grandmother
winkle
sat
down
in
the
chimney
corner
and
called
kit
and
kat
come
here
she
said
and
i
tell
you
some
stories
about
st
nicholas
the
twins
brought
two
little
stools
and
sat
beside
her
one
on
each
side
she
took
out
her
knitting
and
as
the
needles
clicked
in
her
fingers
she
told
this
story
once
upon
a
time
many
years
ago
three
little
brothers
went
out
one
day
to
the
woods
to
gather
fagots
they
were
just
about
as
big
as
you
are
kit
and
kat
were
they
all
three
twins
asked
kat
the
story
does
tell
about
that
said
grandmother
winkle
but
maybe
they
were
at
any
rate
they
all
got
lost
in
the
woods
and
wandered
ever
so
far
trying
to
find
their
way
home
but
instead
of
finding
their
way
home
they
just
got
more
and
more
lost
all
the
time
they
were
very
tired
and
hungry
but
as
they
were
brave
boys
not
one
of
them
cried
it
lucky
that
none
of
those
twins
were
girls
said
kit
i
even
heard
of
boy
twins
that
cried
when
dog
carts
ran
away
or
something
of
that
kind
happened
said
grandmother
winkle
but
you
should
interrupt
it
not
polite
oh
said
kit
very
meekly
well
as
i
was
saying
they
were
very
lost
indeed
night
was
coming
on
and
they
were
just
thinking
that
they
must
lie
down
on
the
ground
to
sleep
when
one
of
them
saw
a
light
shining
through
the
leaves
he
pointed
it
out
to
the
others
and
they
walked
along
toward
it
stumbling
over
roots
and
stones
as
they
went
for
it
was
now
quite
dark
as
they
came
nearer
they
saw
that
the
light
came
from
the
window
of
a
poor
little
hut
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
they
went
to
the
door
and
knocked
the
door
was
opened
by
a
dirty
old
woman
who
lived
in
the
hut
with
her
husband
who
was
a
farmer
the
boys
told
the
old
woman
that
they
had
lost
their
way
and
asked
her
if
she
could
give
them
a
place
to
sleep
she
spoke
to
her
husband
who
sat
crouched
over
a
little
fire
in
the
corner
and
he
told
her
to
give
them
a
bed
in
the
loft
the
three
boys
climbed
the
little
ladder
into
the
loft
and
lay
down
on
the
hay
they
were
so
tired
that
they
fell
asleep
at
once
the
old
man
and
his
wife
whispered
about
them
over
their
bit
of
fire
are
boys
and
well
dressed
said
the
old
woman
said
the
old
man
i
have
no
doubt
they
have
plenty
of
money
about
them
you
really
think
so
said
the
wife
think
i
find
out
said
the
wicked
farmer
so
he
climbed
up
to
the
loft
and
killed
the
three
boys
then
he
looked
in
their
pockets
for
money
but
there
was
no
money
there
he
was
very
angry
and
he
was
very
much
afraid
wicked
people
are
always
afraid
are
all
afraid
people
wicked
asked
kat
she
wished
very
much
that
she
were
brave
well
not
always
said
grandmother
winkle
the
wicked
farmer
was
so
afraid
that
he
wanted
to
put
the
bodies
of
the
three
boys
where
no
one
would
find
them
so
he
carried
them
down
cellar
and
put
them
into
the
pickle
tub
with
his
pork
oh
oh
oh
screamed
kat
and
she
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
even
kit
eyes
were
very
round
and
big
but
grandmother
said
now
do
you
be
scared
until
i
get
to
the
end
of
the
story
did
i
tell
you
it
was
all
about
nicholas
you
wait
and
see
what
happened
that
very
same
day
the
wicked
farmer
went
to
market
with
some
vegetables
to
sell
as
he
was
sitting
in
the
market
nicholas
appeared
before
him
he
had
on
his
mitre
and
his
long
robes
just
as
you
see
him
in
kit
cake
have
you
any
pork
to
sell
nicholas
asked
the
man
no
said
the
farmer
what
of
the
three
young
pigs
in
your
brine
tub
in
the
cellar
said
nicholas
the
farmer
saw
that
his
wicked
deed
was
found
out
as
all
wicked
deeds
are
sooner
or
later
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
begged
the
good
saint
to
forgive
him
nicholas
said
show
me
the
way
to
your
house
the
farmer
left
his
vegetables
unsold
in
the
market
and
went
home
at
once
the
saint
following
all
the
way
when
they
reached
the
hut
nicholas
went
to
the
tub
in
the
cellar
he
waved
his
staff
over
the
tub
and
out
jumped
the
three
boys
hearty
and
well
then
the
good
saint
took
them
through
the
woods
and
left
them
in
sight
of
their
own
home
oh
what
a
good
st
nicholas
said
kit
and
kat
tell
us
another
well
said
grandmother
winkle
once
upon
another
time
there
was
a
very
mean
man
who
had
a
great
deal
of
money
that
often
happens
he
had
also
three
beautiful
daughters
that
sometimes
happens
too
one
day
he
lost
all
his
money
now
he
cared
more
for
money
than
for
anything
else
in
the
world
more
even
than
for
his
three
beautiful
daughters
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
sell
them
nicholas
knew
of
this
wicked
plan
so
that
very
night
he
went
to
the
man
house
and
dropped
some
money
through
a
broken
window
why
did
he
do
that
asked
kat
because
the
man
was
selling
his
daughters
to
get
money
if
he
had
money
enough
he
would
sell
them
the
first
night
nicholas
dropped
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
eldest
daughter
the
next
night
he
took
a
purse
of
gold
for
the
second
daughter
and
dropped
it
down
the
chimney
it
fell
down
right
in
front
of
the
man
as
he
was
getting
a
coal
to
light
his
pipe
the
third
night
the
man
watched
and
when
nicholas
came
the
door
flew
open
and
the
man
ran
out
he
caught
nicholas
by
his
long
robe
and
held
him
o
nicholas
servant
of
the
lord
he
said
why
dost
thou
hide
thy
good
deeds
and
from
that
time
on
every
one
has
known
it
is
nicholas
who
brings
gifts
in
the
night
and
drops
them
down
the
chimney
did
the
man
sell
his
daughter
asked
kat
no
said
grandmother
he
was
so
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
wicked
any
more
does
nicholas
give
everybody
presents
so
they
will
be
good
asked
kat
yes
said
grandmother
that
why
bad
children
get
only
a
rod
in
their
shoes
he
gave
the
bad
man
nice
presents
to
make
him
good
said
kit
why
does
he
give
bad
children
nice
things
to
make
them
good
too
grandmother
winkle
knitted
for
a
minute
without
speaking
then
she
said
i
guess
he
thinks
that
the
rod
is
the
present
that
will
make
them
good
in
the
shortest
time
the
clock
had
been
ticking
steadily
along
while
grandmother
had
been
telling
stories
and
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
the
sky
was
all
red
in
the
west
there
were
long
long
shadows
across
the
snowy
fields
and
the
corners
of
the
kitchen
were
quite
dark
it
almost
time
to
expect
him
now
said
vrouw
vedder
and
she
brought
out
a
sheet
and
spread
it
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
floor
she
stirred
up
the
fire
and
the
room
was
filled
with
the
pleasant
glow
from
the
flames
kit
and
kat
sat
on
their
little
stools
their
eyes
were
very
big
at
five
minutes
of
six
vrouw
vedder
said

few
minutes

from
amsterdam
to
spain
while
they
were
singing
there
was
a
sound
at
the
door
of
some
one
feeling
for
the
latch
then
the
door
flew
open
and
a
great
shower
of
sweet
cakes
and
candies
fell
onto
the
sheet
all
around
kit
and
kat
there
in
the
doorway
stood
nicholas
himself
smiling
and
shaking
off
the
snow
his
horse
was
stamping
outside
kit
and
kat
could
hear
it
they
stopped
singing
and
hardly
breathed
they
stood
so
still
they
looked
at
nicholas
with
big
big
eyes
in
one
hand
nicholas
carried
two
large
packages
in
the
other
a
birch
rod

any
good
children
here
said
nicholas
pretty
good
if

please
dear
nicholas
said
kit
in
a
very
small
voice
children
who
always
mind
their
mothers
and
fathers
and
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
said
nicholas
and
who
do
not
quarrel
kat
could
say
anything
at
all
though
the
saint
looked
right
at
her
vrouw
vedder
spoke
i
think
dear
nicholas
they
are
very
good
children
she
said
then
i
will
leave
these
for
them
and
carry
the
rod
along
to
some
bad
little
boy
and
girl
if
i

said
nicholas
there
seem
to
be
very
few
about
here
i
have
left
a
single
rod
yet
and
he
handed
one
big
package
to
kit
and
another
to
kat
thank
you
said
kit
and
kat
nicholas
smiled
at
them
and
waved
his
hand
then
the
door
shut
and
he
was
gone
kit
and
kat
dropped
on
their
knees
to
pick
up
the
cakes
and
candies
they
passed
the
cakes
and
candies
around
to
each
one
vrouw
vedder
lighted
the
candles
and
then
they
all
gathered
around
to
see
kit
and
kat
open
their
bundles
you
open
yours
first
said
vrouw
vedder
to
kat
kat
was
so
excited
that
she
could
hardly
untie
the
string
when
she
got
the
bundle
open
there
was
a
beautiful
new
sunday
dress
much
prettier
than
the
torn
one
had
ever
been
oh
how
pleased
kat
was
she
hugged
her
mother
and
her
grandmother
and
her
father
and
her
grandfather
i
just
wish
i
could
hug
dear
nicholas
too
she
said
then
kit
opened
his
bundle
and
there
was
a
beautiful
new
velveteen
suit
with
his
very
own
silver
buttons
on
it
it
had
pockets
in
it
he
put
his
hand
in
one
pocket
it
had
a
penny
in
it
then
he
put
his
hand
in
the
other
pocket
there
was
another
penny
i
going
to
see
if
there
a
pocket
in
mine
said
kat
she
hunted
and
hunted
and
hunted
by
and
by
she
found
a
pocket
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
penny
in
that
too
then
some
presents
came
from
somewhere
for
father
and
mother
vedder
and
for
grandfather
and
grandmother
winkle
and
such
a
time
as
they
all
had
opening
the
bundles
and
showing
their
presents
then
mother
vedder
tried
on
kit
suit
and
kat
dress
to
see
if
they
were
the
right
size
they
were
just
right
exactly
nicholas
even
knows
how
big
we
are
said
kat
oh
i
wish
nicholas
day
would
last
a
week
said
kit
that
reminds
me
said
vrouw
vedder
and
she
looked
at
the
clock
ten
and
these
children
still
up
bless
my
heart
this
will
never
do
come
here
kit
and
kat
and
let
me
undo
your
buttons
may
we
take
our
new
clothes
to
bed
with
us
kat
asked
yes
just
this
once
said
mother
vedder
because
this
is
nicholas
night
they
kissed
their
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
their
mother
and
father
and
said
their
prayers
like
good
children
and
then
they
climbed
up
into
their
little
cupboard
bed
and
vrouw
vedder
drew
the
curtains
so
they
would
go
to
sleep
sooner
dear
little
twins
she
said
and
so
say
we
suggestions
to
teachers
this
book
is
the
first
of
a
series
of
stories
for
supplementary
reading
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
give
children
a
correct
idea
of
life
in
different
countries
both
in
the
spirit
and
atmosphere
of
the
story
and
in
the
actual
descriptions
these
books
will
also
further
a
spirit
of
friendliness
and
good
will
for
children
of
other
nationalities
respect
for
and
an
understanding
of
the
life
and
customs
of
other
races
are
not
only
educationally
valuable
but
are
fundamentally
important
in
this
crucible
of
nations
where
different
races
are
fusing
themselves
together
as
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
tradition
is
a
precious
heritage
and
the
traditions
of
other
nations
should
be
the
natural
inheritance
of
the
american
child
since
here
as
nowhere
else
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
are
entering
into
our
national
life
the
author
has
recognized
from
the
start
that
the
purpose
of
a
book
of
this
kind
would
fail
of
realization
if
the
narrative
does
not
appeal
strongly
to
children
the
delight
with
which
the
book
has
been
received
by
children
is
evidence
that
the
important
element
of
interest
has
not
been
left
out
of
the
narrative
to
make
the
reading
of
this
story
most
valuable
as
a
school
exercise
it
is
suggested
that
children
be
allowed
at
the
outset
to
turn
the
pages
of
the
book
in
order
to
get
glimpses
of
kit
and
kat
in
the
various
scenes
in
which
they
are
portrayed
in
the
illustrations
thus
arousing
their
interest
with
a
globe
or
a
map
of
the
world
point
out
holland
and
tell
the
children
something
about
the
unique
character
of
the
country
the
text
is
so
simply
written
that
any
third
or
fourth
grade
child
can
read
it
without
much
preparation
in
the
third
grade
it
may
be
well
to
have
the
children
read
it
first
in
the
study
period
in
order
to
work
out
the
pronunciation
of
the
more
difficult
words
in
the
fourth
grade
the
children
can
usually
read
it
at
sight
without
the
preparatory
study
in
connection
with
the
reading
of
the
book
have
children
read
selections
from
their
readers
and
other
books
about
holland
and
its
people
the
legend
of
the
hole
in
the
dike
is
an
illustration
of
this
kind
of
collateral
reading
let
children
also
bring
to
class
postcards
and
other
pictures
illustrating
scenes
in
holland
the
unique
illustrations
in
the
book
should
be
much
used
both
in
the
reading
of
the
story
and
in
other
ways
children
will
enjoy
sketching
some
of
the
pictures
their
simple
treatment
makes
them
especially
useful
for
this
purpose
an
excellent
oral
language
exercise
would
be
for
the
children
after
they
have
read
the
story
to
take
turns
telling
the
story
from
the
pictures
and
a
good
composition
exercise
would
be
for
each
child
to
select
the
picture
that
he
would
like
to
write
upon
make
a
sketch
of
it
and
write
the
story
in
his
own
words
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
number
of
ways
that
will
occur
to
resourceful
teachers
of
making
the
book
a
valuable
as
well
as
an
interesting
exercise
in
reading
