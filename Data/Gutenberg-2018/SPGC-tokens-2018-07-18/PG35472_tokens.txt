chapter
i
introductory
most
of
the
volumes
of
this
series
are
occupied
with
large
subjects
and
subjects
commonly
recognized
as
important
to
great
masses
of
people
at
the
present
day
in
devoting
the
present
volume
to
the
study
of
a
single
writer
remote
from
us
in
time
and
civilization
and
scarcely
known
by
more
than
name
to
many
readers
of
the
library
i
am
moved
by
the
belief
that
quite
apart
from
his
disputed
greatness
as
a
poet
and
thinker
apart
from
his
amazing
and
perhaps
unparalleled
success
as
a
practical
playwright
euripides
is
a
figure
of
high
significance
in
the
history
of
humanity
and
of
special
interest
to
our
own
generation
born
according
to
the
legend
in
exile
and
fated
to
die
in
exile
euripides
in
whatever
light
one
regards
him
is
a
man
of
curious
and
ironic
history
as
a
poet
he
has
lived
through
the
ages
in
an
atmosphere
of
controversy
generally
though
by
no
means
always
loved
by
poets
and
despised
by
critics
as
a
thinker
he
is
even
to
this
day
treated
almost
as
a
personal
enemy
by
scholars
of
orthodox
and
conformist
minds
defended
idealized
and
sometimes
transformed
beyond
recognition
by
various
champions
of
rebellion
and
the
free
intellect
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
feel
in
writing
about
him
is
to
keep
in
mind
without
loss
of
proportion
anything
like
the
whole
activity
of
the
man
recent
writers
have
tended
to
emphasize
chiefly
his
work
as
a
destructive
thinker
verrall
the
most
brilliant
of
all
modern
critics
of
euripides
to
whose
pioneer
work
my
own
debt
is
greater
than
i
can
well
express
entitled
one
of
his
books
euripides
the
rationalist
and
followed
to
its
extreme
limit
the
path
indicated
by
this
particular
clue
his
vivid
and
interesting
disciple
professor
norwood
has
followed
him
in
germany
nestlé
in
a
sober
and
learned
book
treating
of
euripides
as
a
thinker
says
that
all
mysticism
was
fundamentally
repugnant
to
him
a
view
which
is
certainly
wrong
since
some
of
the
finest
expressions
of
greek
mysticism
known
to
us
are
taken
from
the
works
of
euripides
another
good
writer
steiger
draws
an
elaborate
parallel
between
euripides
and
ibsen
and
finds
the
one
key
to
euripides
in
his
realism
and
his
absolute
devotion
to
truth
yet
an
older
generation
of
felt
these
things
quite
differently
when
macaulay
proclaimed
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
literature
to
equal
he
was
certainly
not
thinking
about
rationalism
or
realism
he
felt
the
romance
the
magic
the
sheer
poetry
so
did
milton
and
shelley
and
browning
and
so
did
the
older
english
scholars
like
porson
and
elmsley
porson
while
admitting
that
the
critics
have
many
things
to
say
against
euripides
as
compared
for
instance
with
sophocles
answers
in
his
inarticulate
way
admiramur
hunc
we
admire
the
one
but
we
read
the
other
elmsley
so
far
from
regarding
euripides
as
mainly
a
thinker
remarks
in
passing
that
he
was
a
poet
singularly
addicted
to
contradicting
himself
to
porson
and
elmsley
the
poetry
of
euripides
might
or
might
not
be
good
on
the
highest
plane
it
was
at
any
rate
delightful
quite
different
again
are
the
momentous
judgments
pronounced
upon
him
as
a
writer
of
tragedy
by
two
of
the
greatest
judges
aristotle
writing
at
a
period
when
euripides
was
rather
out
of
fashion
and
subjecting
him
to
much
serious
and
sometimes
unintelligent
criticism
considers
him
still
the
most
tragic
of
the
poets
and
goethe
after
expressing
his
surprise
at
the
general
belittling
of
euripides
by
the
aristocracy
of
philologists
led
by
the
buffoon
aristophanes
asks
emphatically
have
all
the
nations
of
the
world
since
his
time
produced
one
dramatist
who
was
worthy
to
hand
him
his
slippers
tagebüchern
november
we
must
try
if
we
can
to
bear
duly
in
mind
all
these
different
lines
of
approach
as
a
playwright
the
fate
of
euripides
has
been
strange
all
through
a
long
life
he
was
almost
invariably
beaten
in
the
state
competitions
he
was
steadily
admired
by
some
few
philosophers
like
socrates
he
enjoyed
immense
fame
throughout
greece
but
the
official
judges
of
poetry
were
against
him
and
his
own
people
of
athens
admired
him
reluctantly
and
with
a
grudge
after
death
indeed
he
seemed
to
come
into
his
kingdom
he
held
the
stage
as
no
other
tragedian
has
ever
held
it
and
we
hear
of
his
plays
being
performed
with
popular
success
six
hundred
years
after
they
were
written
and
in
countries
far
removed
from
greece
he
influenced
all
the
higher
forms
of
greek
writing
both
in
prose
and
poetry
he
is
more
quoted
by
subsequent
writers
than
any
other
greek
tragedian
nay
if
we
leave
out
of
count
mere
dictionary
references
to
rare
words
he
is
more
quoted
than
all
the
other
tragedians
together
and
nineteen
of
his
plays
have
survived
to
our
own
day
as
against
seven
each
of
aeschylus
and
sophocles
this
seems
enough
glory
for
any
man
yet
the
fate
that
grudged
him
prizes
in
his
lifetime
contrived
afterwards
to
spread
a
veneer
of
commonplaceness
over
the
success
which
it
could
not
prevent
to
a
great
extent
euripides
was
read
because
he
was
or
seemed
easy
the
older
poets
were
neglected
because
they
were
difficult
attic
greek
in
his
hands
had
begun
to
assume
the
form
in
which
it
remained
for
a
thousand
years
as
the
recognized
literary
language
of
the
east
of
europe
and
the
great
instrument
and
symbol
of
civilization
he
was
a
of
attic
style
and
ancient
maxims
and
eminently
useful
to
orators
who
liked
quotations
meantime
the
melody
and
meaning
of
his
lyrics
were
lost
because
men
had
forgotten
the
pronunciation
of
greek
and
could
no
longer
read
lyrics
intelligently
the
obviously
exciting
quality
of
his
plays
kept
its
effect
but
there
was
no
one
to
understand
the
subtlety
of
his
craftsmanship
the
intimate
study
of
character
the
skilful
forging
of
links
and
clashes
between
scenes
the
mastery
of
that
most
wonderful
of
greek
dramatic
instruments
the
chorus
plays
had
practically
ceased
to
be
written
they
were
thought
of
either
as
rhetorical
exercises
or
as
spectacles
for
the
amphitheatre
something
similar
happened
to
the
whole
inward
spirit
in
which
he
worked
call
it
philosophy
or
call
it
religion
its
meaning
became
obscured
it
had
indeed
a
powerful
influence
on
the
philosophers
of
the
great
fourth
century
schools
they
probably
understood
at
least
one
side
of
him
but
the
sayings
of
his
that
are
quoted
broadcast
and
repeated
through
author
after
author
of
the
decadence
are
mostly
thoughts
of
quite
the
second
rank
which
have
lost
half
their
value
by
being
torn
from
their
context
often
commonplace
often
as
is
natural
in
fragments
of
dramas
mutually
contradictory
though
almost
always
simply
and
clearly
expressed
it
was
this
clear
expression
which
the
late
greeks
valued
so
highly
clarity
was
the
watchword
of
style
in
euripides
own
day
and
remained
always
the
foremost
aim
of
greek
rhetoric
indeed
what
a
greek
called
rhetorikê
often
implied
the
very
opposite
of
what
we
call
rhetoric
to
think
clearly
to
arrange
your
matter
under
formal
heads
to
have
each
paragraph
definitely
articulated
and
each
sentence
simply
and
exactly
expressed
that
was
the
main
lesson
of
the
greek
rhetor
the
tendency
was
already
beginning
in
classical
times
and
no
classical
writer
carried
it
further
than
euripides
but
here
again
fate
has
been
ironical
with
him
the
ages
that
were
incapable
of
understanding
him
loved
him
for
his
clearness
our
own
age
which
might
at
last
understand
him
is
instinctively
repelled
by
it
we
do
not
much
like
a
poet
to
be
very
clear
and
we
hate
him
to
be
formal
we
are
clever
readers
quick
in
the
apt
to
feel
flattered
and
stimulated
by
a
little
obscurity
mystical
philosophy
is
all
very
well
in
a
poet
but
intellect
no
at
any
rate
we
are
sharply
offended
by
firstlys
secondlys
and
thirdlys
by
divisions
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
and
all
this
and
more
euripides
insists
on
giving
us
it
is
the
great
obstacle
between
him
and
us
apart
from
it
we
have
only
to
exercise
a
little
historical
imagination
and
we
shall
find
in
him
a
man
not
indeed
modern
half
his
charm
is
that
he
is
so
remote
and
austere
but
a
man
who
has
in
his
mind
the
same
problems
as
ourselves
the
same
doubts
and
largely
the
same
ideals
who
has
felt
the
same
desires
and
indignations
as
a
great
number
of
people
at
the
present
day
especially
young
people
not
because
young
people
are
cleverer
than
old
nor
yet
because
they
are
less
wise
but
because
the
poet
or
philosopher
or
martyr
who
lives
inside
most
human
beings
is
apt
to
be
smothered
or
starved
to
death
in
the
course
of
middle
life
as
long
as
he
is
still
alive
we
have
most
of
us
the
key
to
understanding
euripides
what
then
shall
be
our
method
in
approaching
him
it
is
fatal
to
fly
straight
at
him
with
modern
analogies
we
must
see
him
in
his
own
atmosphere
every
man
who
possesses
real
vitality
can
be
seen
as
the
resultant
of
two
forces
he
is
first
the
child
of
a
particular
age
society
convention
of
what
we
may
call
in
one
word
a
tradition
he
is
secondly
in
one
degree
or
another
a
rebel
against
that
tradition
and
the
best
traditions
make
the
best
rebels
euripides
is
the
child
of
a
strong
and
splendid
tradition
and
is
together
with
plato
the
fiercest
of
all
rebels
against
it
there
is
nothing
paradoxical
in
this
no
tradition
is
perfect
the
best
brings
only
a
passing
period
of
peace
or
triumph
or
stable
equilibrium
humanity
rests
for
a
moment
but
knows
that
it
must
travel
further
to
rest
for
ever
would
be
to
die
the
most
thorough
conformists
are
probably
at
their
best
when
forced
to
fight
for
their
ideal
against
forces
that
would
destroy
it
and
a
tradition
itself
is
generally
at
its
best
not
when
it
is
universally
accepted
but
when
it
is
being
attacked
and
broken
it
is
then
that
it
learns
to
search
its
own
heart
and
live
up
to
its
full
meaning
and
in
a
sense
the
greatest
triumph
that
any
tradition
can
accomplish
is
to
rear
noble
and
worthy
rebels
the
greek
tradition
of
the
fifth
century
the
great
age
of
athens
not
only
achieved
extraordinary
advances
in
most
departments
of
human
life
but
it
trained
an
extraordinary
band
of
critical
or
rebellious
children
many
a
reader
of
plato
most
splendid
satires
against
democratic
athens
will
feel
within
him
the
conclusive
answer
no
place
but
athens
could
ever
have
reared
such
a
man
as
this
and
taught
him
to
see
these
faults
or
conceive
these
ideals
we
are
in
reaction
now
against
another
great
age
an
age
whose
achievements
in
art
are
memorable
in
literature
massive
and
splendid
in
science
and
invention
absolutely
unparalleled
but
greatest
of
all
perhaps
in
the
raising
of
all
standards
of
public
duty
the
humanizing
of
law
and
society
and
the
awakening
of
high
ideals
in
social
and
international
politics
the
victorian
age
had
amid
enormous
differences
a
certain
similarity
with
the
periclean
in
its
lack
of
its
rush
and
chivalry
and
optimism
its
unconscious
hypocrisy
its
failure
to
think
out
its
problems
to
the
bitter
end
and
in
most
of
the
current
criticism
on
things
victorian
so
far
as
it
is
not
mere
fashion
or
folly
one
seems
to
feel
the
victorian
spirit
itself
speaking
it
arraigns
victorian
things
by
a
victorian
standard
blames
them
not
because
they
have
moved
in
a
particular
direction
but
because
they
have
not
moved
far
enough
because
so
many
of
the
things
they
attempted
are
still
left
undone
because
the
ideals
they
preached
and
the
standards
by
which
they
claimed
to
be
acting
were
so
much
harder
of
satisfaction
than
they
knew
euripides
like
ourselves
comes
in
an
age
of
criticism
following
upon
an
age
of
movement
and
action
and
for
the
most
part
like
ourselves
he
accepts
the
general
standards
on
which
the
movement
and
action
were
based
he
accepts
the
athenian
ideals
of
free
thought
free
speech
democracy
virtue
and
patriotism
he
arraigns
his
country
because
she
is
false
to
them
we
have
spoken
of
the
tradition
as
a
homogeneous
thing
but
for
any
poet
or
artist
there
are
two
quite
different
webs
in
it
there
are
the
accepted
conventions
of
his
art
and
the
accepted
beliefs
of
his
intellect
the
one
set
aiming
at
the
production
of
beauty
the
others
at
the
attainment
of
truth
now
for
every
artist
who
is
also
a
critic
or
rebel
there
is
a
difference
of
kind
between
these
two
sets
of
conventions
for
the
purposes
of
truth
the
tradition
is
absolutely
indifferent
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
it
does
so
not
a
whit
the
less
because
most
ages
have
believed
the
opposite
the
seeker
for
truth
can
as
far
as
truth
is
concerned
reject
tradition
without
a
qualm
but
with
art
the
case
is
different
art
has
to
give
a
message
from
one
man
to
another
as
you
can
only
speak
to
a
man
in
a
language
which
you
both
know
so
you
can
only
appeal
to
his
artistic
side
by
means
of
some
common
tradition
his
natural
expectation
whether
we
try
to
satisfy
or
to
surprise
it
to
surpass
or
to
disappoint
it
is
always
an
essential
element
in
the
artistic
effect
consequently
the
tradition
can
not
be
disregarded
this
distinction
is
often
strongly
marked
in
the
practice
of
different
artists
one
poet
may
be
both
a
pioneer
of
new
roads
in
thought
and
a
breaker
of
the
laws
of
technique
like
walt
whitman
an
enemy
of
the
tradition
in
both
kinds
another
may
be
slack
and
anarchical
in
his
technique
though
quite
conventional
in
his
thought
i
refrain
from
suggesting
instances
still
more
clearly
there
are
poets
such
as
shelley
or
swinburne
whose
works
are
full
of
intellectual
rebellion
while
their
technique
is
exquisite
and
elaborate
the
thoughts
are
bold
and
strange
the
form
is
the
traditional
form
developed
and
made
more
exquisite
now
euripides
except
for
some
licences
in
metre
belongs
in
my
judgment
markedly
to
the
last
class
in
speculation
he
is
a
critic
and
a
free
lance
in
artistic
form
he
is
intensely
traditional
he
seems
to
have
loved
the
very
stiffnesses
of
the
form
in
which
he
worked
he
developed
its
inherent
powers
in
ways
undreamed
of
but
he
never
broke
the
mould
or
strayed
away
into
shapelessness
or
mere
realism
his
last
and
in
many
respects
his
greatest
play
the
is
as
far
as
our
evidence
goes
the
most
formal
that
he
ever
wrote
these
then
are
the
lights
in
which
we
propose
to
look
at
euripides
in
attempting
to
reconstruct
his
life
we
must
be
conscious
of
two
backgrounds
against
which
he
will
be
found
standing
according
as
we
regard
him
as
thinker
or
as
pure
artist
we
must
first
try
to
understand
something
of
the
tradition
of
thought
in
which
he
was
reared
that
is
the
general
atmosphere
of
fifth
century
athens
and
watch
how
he
expressed
it
and
how
he
reacted
against
it
next
we
must
understand
what
greek
tragedy
was
what
rituals
and
conventions
held
it
firm
and
what
inner
fire
kept
it
living
and
so
study
the
method
in
which
euripides
used
it
for
his
chosen
mode
of
expression
obeying
its
laws
and
at
the
same
time
liberating
its
spirit
chapter
ii
the
sources
for
a
life
of
euripides
the
memories
remaining
in
the
fourth
century
his
youth
and
its
surroundings
athens
after
the
persian
war
the
great
sophists
it
is
in
one
sense
impossible
to
write
a
life
of
euripides
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
lived
too
long
ago
in
his
time
people
were
only
just
beginning
to
write
history
at
all
herodotus
the
father
of
history
was
his
close
contemporary
they
had
begun
to
record
really
great
events
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
that
the
life
of
any
individual
was
worth
all
the
trouble
of
tracing
out
and
writing
down
biography
of
a
sort
began
about
two
generations
afterwards
when
the
disciples
of
aristotle
and
epicurus
exerted
themselves
to
find
out
and
record
the
lives
of
their
masters
but
biography
in
our
sense
the
complete
writing
of
a
life
year
by
year
with
dates
and
documents
was
never
practised
at
all
in
antiquity
think
of
the
gospels
of
the
acts
even
of
tacitus
of
they
are
different
one
from
another
but
they
are
all
unlike
any
modern
biography
in
their
resolute
indifference
to
anything
like
completeness
ancient
lives
as
a
rule
select
a
few
great
deeds
a
few
great
sayings
or
discourses
they
concentrate
upon
the
last
years
of
their
subject
and
often
especially
upon
his
death
the
dates
at
which
various
eminent
men
of
antiquity
died
are
well
known
the
man
was
then
famous
and
his
death
was
a
memorable
event
but
except
in
a
few
aristocratic
states
like
cos
which
records
the
actual
birthday
of
the
great
physician
hippocrates
no
baby
was
eminent
and
not
many
young
men
very
few
dates
of
birth
are
known
and
in
the
case
of
almost
all
the
famous
men
of
antiquity
their
early
histories
are
forgotten
and
their
early
works
lost
so
it
is
with
euripides
history
in
later
antiquity
was
chiefly
a
branch
of
and
made
no
great
effort
after
exactness
as
a
rule
it
contented
itself
with
the
date
at
which
a
man
flourished
a
very
rough
conception
conventionally
fixed
either
by
the
time
when
he
did
his
most
memorable
work
or
the
year
when
he
reached
the
age
of
forty
the
year
commonly
assigned
to
euripides
birth
is
a
good
instance
of
ancient
method
in
these
things
the
system
of
chronology
was
badly
confused
in
the
first
place
there
was
no
generally
accepted
era
from
which
to
date
and
even
if
there
had
been
the
numerical
system
before
the
invention
of
arabic
ciphers
was
as
confused
as
english
spelling
is
at
the
present
day
and
made
it
hard
to
do
the
simplest
sums
so
the
ordinary
educational
plan
was
to
group
events
together
in
some
scheme
that
might
not
be
quite
exact
but
was
calculated
to
have
some
symbolic
interest
and
to
stay
in
the
memory
for
instance
the
three
great
tragedians
were
grouped
together
round
the
battle
of
salamis
the
great
triumph
of
the
persian
wars
in
aeschylus
fought
among
the
infantry
sophocles
danced
in
a
choir
of
boys
to
celebrate
the
victory
and
euripides
was
born
in
salamis
on
the
day
of
the
battle
we
do
not
know
the
origin
of
this
pleasant
fable
but
we
have
another
date
given
in
a
very
ancient
chronicle
called
the
which
was
found
in
the
island
of
paros
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
was
composed
in
the
year
it
puts
the
birth
of
euripides
in
and
since
we
can
not
find
any
reason
why
this
year
should
be
invented
and
since
the
is
the
oldest
witness
now
extant
we
shall
probably
do
well
provisionally
to
accept
its
statement
in
some
of
the
mss
which
preserve
euripides
plays
there
are
scholia
or
ancient
traditional
commentaries
written
round
the
margin
a
few
of
the
oldest
notes
in
them
come
from
alexandrian
scholars
who
lived
in
the
second
century
others
date
from
roman
times
in
the
first
few
centuries
of
the
christian
era
others
from
the
eleventh
century
and
even
later
and
among
them
there
is
a
quite
ancient
document
called
and
race
of
it
is
anonymous
and
shapeless
sentences
may
have
been
added
or
omitted
by
the
various
people
who
at
different
times
have
owned
or
copied
the
mss
but
we
can
see
that
it
is
derived
from
early
sources
and
notably
from
a
life
which
was
written
by
one
satyrus
a
writer
of
the
peripatetic
or
aristotelian
school
towards
the
end
of
the
third
century
fragments
from
the
same
source
have
been
detected
in
the
latin
authors
varro
and
gellius
and
it
has
influenced
the
biographical
notice
in
the
ancient
greek
lexicon
of
suidas
tenth
century
suidas
used
also
another
earlier
and
better
source
the
of
philochorus
philochorus
was
a
careful
and
systematic
annalist
of
the
early
third
century
who
used
official
documents
and
verified
his
statements
his
main
work
was
to
record
all
that
affected
athens
history
myths
festivals
and
customs
but
he
also
wrote
various
special
treatises
one
of
which
was
satyrus
wrote
a
series
of
of
famous
which
was
very
popular
and
we
are
now
since
in
a
position
to
judge
how
undeserved
its
popularity
was
for
fragments
of
his
of
have
been
unearthed
in
egypt
by
drs
grenfell
and
hunt
and
published
in
their
vol
ix
the
life
takes
the
form
of
a
dialogue
apparently
a
dialogue
with
a
lady
it
is
a
mass
of
quotations
anecdotes
bits
of
literary
criticism
all
run
together
with
an
air
of
culture
and
pleasantness
a
spice
of
gallantry
and
a
surprising
indifference
to
historical
fact
evidently
anecdotes
amused
satyrus
and
facts
as
such
did
not
he
cared
about
literary
style
but
he
neither
cared
nor
knew
about
history
the
following
considerations
will
make
this
clear
euripides
was
more
than
any
other
figure
in
ancient
history
a
constant
butt
for
the
attacks
of
comedy
and
we
find
oddly
enough
that
most
of
the
anecdotes
about
euripides
in
satyrus
are
simply
the
jokes
of
comedy
treated
as
historical
fact
for
instance
in
aristophanes
play
women
at
the
the
women
while
alone
at
this
private
festival
agree
to
murder
euripides
because
by
his
penetrating
study
of
female
character
on
the
stage
he
has
made
life
too
difficult
for
them
euripides
hearing
of
the
plot
persuades
his
elderly
to
go
in
disguise
to
the
forbidden
celebration
and
defend
him
which
he
does
in
a
ruinously
tactless
way
some
scenes
of
brilliant
farce
are
succeeded
by
a
solemn
truce
between
euripides
and
the
women
of
athens
it
shows
what
our
tradition
is
worth
when
we
find
that
both
the
and
and
gellius
and
satyrus
himself
give
as
sober
fact
this
story
which
we
know
and
if
we
did
not
know
could
surely
see
to
be
comic
invention
there
is
another
class
of
fabulous
anecdote
which
plays
an
even
larger
part
in
the
satyrus
tradition
in
aristophanes
in
a
scene
where
euripides
is
defending
his
plays
against
the
attacks
of
aeschylus
there
occurs
the
chance
suggestion
that
euripides
had
learnt
from
his
own
experience
all
the
varied
villanies
of
his
wicked
heroines
the
idea
took
root
and
he
is
represented
in
the
anecdotes
as
a
deceived
husband
like
his
own
theseus
or
proetus
and
uttering
lines
suitable
to
the
occasion
out
of
his
own
tragedies
as
having
two
wives
at
once
like
his
own
neoptolemus
one
of
them
named
choirile
or
piggy
and
each
of
course
worse
than
the
other
as
torn
to
pieces
by
hounds
like
his
own
actaeon
or
by
wild
women
like
his
own
pentheus
something
of
this
sort
is
possibly
the
origin
of
a
famous
joke
about
euripides
mother
which
runs
through
aristophanes
and
is
repeated
as
a
fact
in
all
the
lives
we
know
from
philochorus
that
it
was
not
true
the
joke
is
to
connect
her
with
chervil
a
grassy
vegetable
which
grew
wild
and
was
only
eaten
in
time
of
famine
or
with
wild
in
general
or
simply
to
call
her
a
greengrocer
it
was
also
a
joke
to
say
anything
about
a
man
begs
euripides
to
bring
a
chervil
from
thy
mother
breast
or
we
hear
that
wild
wrongs
he
works
on
women
wild
as
the
greens
that
waved
about
his
cradle
when
some
one
is
about
to
quote
euripides
his
friend
cries
do
do
for
god
sake
do
me
now
a
line
from
euripides
tragedy
the
runs
it
is
not
my
word
but
my
mother
word
and
we
know
that
melanippe
and
still
more
her
mother
was
an
authority
on
potent
herbs
and
simples
turn
his
heroine
mother
into
his
own
mother
and
the
potent
herbs
into
some
absurd
vegetable
and
the
fable
is
made
setting
aside
this
fog
of
misunderstanding
and
reckless
anecdote
let
us
try
to
make
out
the
method
on
which
our
best
authority
philochorus
may
have
put
together
his
account
of
euripides
he
had
almost
no
written
materials
he
had
no
collection
of
letters
and
papers
such
as
go
to
the
making
of
a
modern
biography
he
could
however
consult
the
public
records
of
tragic
performances
as
collected
and
edited
by
aristotle
and
his
pupils
and
thus
fix
the
dates
of
euripides
plays
especially
his
first
and
last
performance
his
first
victory
and
the
like
he
would
also
find
a
few
public
inscriptions
in
which
the
poet
name
was
mentioned
for
the
archives
of
that
time
were
mostly
engraved
on
stone
and
put
up
in
public
places
there
was
also
a
portrait
bust
authentic
though
slightly
idealized
taken
in
the
poet
old
age
and
showing
the
worn
and
beautiful
face
the
thin
hair
and
the
lips
somewhat
fallen
in
these
sources
would
give
him
a
few
skeleton
facts
for
anything
more
he
would
have
to
depend
on
the
accidental
memories
that
survived
if
he
wrote
about
there
was
no
one
living
who
could
remember
a
man
who
died
in
but
there
might
be
men
of
seventy
whose
fathers
had
spoken
to
euripides
and
whose
grandfathers
had
known
him
well
thus
he
might
with
luck
have
struck
some
vein
of
intimate
and
intelligent
memory
which
would
have
helped
us
to
understand
the
great
man
but
he
did
not
the
memories
are
all
about
the
poet
old
age
and
they
are
all
very
external
we
hear
that
he
wore
a
long
beard
and
had
moles
on
his
face
he
lived
very
much
alone
and
hated
visitors
and
parties
he
had
a
quantity
of
books
and
could
not
bear
women
he
lived
on
the
island
of
salamis
in
a
cave
which
had
two
openings
and
a
beautiful
view
a
good
cave
was
probably
more
comfortable
than
many
a
greek
house
so
this
may
not
have
been
a
great
eccentricity
and
there
you
could
see
him
all
day
long
thinking
to
himself
and
writing
for
he
simply
despised
anything
that
was
not
great
and
high
it
is
like
the
memories
of
a
child
rather
a
puzzled
child
watching
the
great
man
from
a
distance
some
few
things
come
out
clearly
he
lived
in
his
last
years
with
a
small
knot
of
intimates
mnesilochus
his
wife
father
or
perhaps
another
mnesilochus
of
the
same
family
was
a
close
friend
so
was
his
servant
or
secretary
cephisophon
we
do
not
hear
of
socrates
as
an
intimate
the
two
owed
a
great
debt
to
one
another
and
we
hear
that
socrates
never
went
to
the
theatre
except
when
euripides
had
a
play
performing
to
see
a
euripides
play
he
would
even
stir
himself
so
far
as
to
walk
all
the
way
to
the
piraeus
but
it
is
likely
enough
that
both
men
were
too
vivid
and
original
perhaps
too
much
accustomed
to
dominate
their
respective
circles
to
be
quite
comfortable
in
the
same
room
and
we
never
find
euripides
conversing
with
socrates
in
plato
dialogues
some
of
euripides
older
friends
were
by
this
time
driven
out
from
athens
the
great
sophist
protagoras
had
read
his
famous
book
the
in
euripides
own
house
but
he
was
now
dead
drowned
at
sea
and
the
poet
master
anaxagoras
had
died
long
before
some
of
the
younger
artists
seem
to
have
found
a
friend
in
euripides
there
was
timotheus
the
young
ionian
composer
who
like
most
musicians
of
any
originality
was
supposed
to
have
corrupted
the
music
of
the
day
by
his
florid
style
and
bold
inventions
his
first
performance
in
athens
was
a
mortifying
failure
and
we
are
told
that
the
passionate
ionian
was
on
the
point
of
killing
himself
when
the
old
poet
came
and
encouraged
him
he
had
only
to
hold
fast
and
the
people
who
now
hissed
would
turn
and
applaud
one
fact
is
especially
clear
the
restless
enmity
of
the
comic
writers
of
the
eleven
comedies
of
aristophanes
which
have
come
down
to
us
three
are
largely
devoted
to
euripides
and
not
one
has
managed
altogether
to
avoid
touching
him
i
know
of
no
parallel
to
it
in
all
the
history
of
literature
has
there
ever
again
been
a
tragic
poet
or
any
poet
who
so
centred
upon
himself
year
after
year
till
he
was
nearly
eighty
the
mocking
attention
of
all
the
popular
wits
and
how
was
it
that
the
athenian
public
never
tired
of
this
incessant
these
incessant
appeals
to
literary
criticism
in
the
midst
of
farce
the
attacks
are
sometimes
rough
and
vicious
sometimes
acute
and
searching
often
enough
they
hide
a
secret
admiration
and
the
chief
enemy
aristophanes
must
to
judge
from
his
parodies
have
known
a
large
number
of
euripides
plays
by
heart
and
been
at
least
half
fascinated
by
the
object
of
his
satire
however
that
may
be
the
hostility
of
the
comic
writers
had
evidently
a
general
hostility
behind
it
our
tradition
states
this
definitely
and
the
persistency
of
the
attacks
proves
it
you
can
not
go
on
constantly
deriding
on
the
stage
a
person
whom
your
audience
does
not
wish
derided
and
the
unpopularity
of
euripides
as
we
shall
see
later
is
not
hard
to
understand
the
satyrus
tradition
puts
it
down
to
his
personal
aloofness
and
austerity
he
avoided
society
and
he
made
no
effort
to
please
his
audience
so
that
at
least
he
did
not
soften
by
personal
pleasantness
the
opposition
they
felt
to
his
whole
view
of
life
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
utterly
alienated
from
the
war
party
and
the
mob
leaders
here
he
only
agreed
with
aristophanes
it
was
that
he
had
pierced
through
to
a
deeper
stratum
of
thought
in
which
most
of
the
pursuits
and
ideals
of
the
men
about
him
stood
condemned
socrates
reached
the
same
plane
and
they
killed
socrates
it
is
somewhat
harder
to
understand
the
universal
assumption
of
our
authorities
that
euripides
was
a
notorious
castigator
of
the
female
sex
and
that
the
women
of
athens
naturally
hated
him
to
us
he
seems
an
aggressive
champion
of
women
more
aggressive
and
certainly
far
more
appreciative
than
plato
songs
and
speeches
from
the
are
recited
at
suffragist
meetings
his
tragic
heroines
are
famous
and
are
almost
always
treated
with
greater
interest
and
insight
than
his
heroes
yet
not
only
the
ancients
but
all
critics
up
to
the
last
generation
or
so
have
described
him
as
a
what
does
it
mean
is
aristophanes
ironical
and
are
the
scholiasts
and
grammarians
merely
stupid
or
is
there
some
explanation
for
this
extraordinary
judgment
i
think
the
explanation
is
that
the
present
age
is
the
first
or
almost
the
first
that
has
learned
to
treat
its
heroines
in
fiction
as
real
human
beings
with
what
are
called
mixed
characters
as
lately
as
the
time
of
sir
walter
scott
perhaps
as
lately
as
dickens
common
convention
demanded
that
a
heroine
if
sympathetic
should
be
so
free
from
faults
as
to
be
almost
without
character
ibsen
heroines
who
were
real
human
beings
studied
with
sympathy
but
with
profound
sincerity
seemed
to
their
generation
shocking
and
even
horrible
all
through
the
ages
the
ideal
of
womanhood
in
conventional
fiction
has
mostly
been
of
the
type
praised
by
one
great
athenian
thinker
the
greatest
glory
for
a
woman
is
to
be
as
little
mentioned
as
possible
among
men
if
that
ideal
was
really
predominant
among
the
women
of
athens
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
felt
outraged
by
euripides
they
had
not
reached
and
most
of
their
husbands
had
not
reached
the
point
of
being
interested
in
good
study
of
character
much
less
the
point
of
demanding
a
freer
and
more
strenuous
life
to
the
average
stupid
athenian
it
was
probably
rather
wicked
for
a
woman
to
have
any
character
wicked
for
her
to
wish
to
take
part
in
public
life
wicked
for
her
to
acquire
learning
or
to
doubt
any
part
of
the
conventional
religion
just
as
it
was
wicked
for
her
to
deceive
her
husband
such
women
should
not
be
spoken
about
above
all
they
should
not
be
treated
with
understanding
and
sympathy
the
understanding
made
it
all
infinitely
worse
to
people
of
this
type
the
women
of
euripides
must
have
been
simply
shocking
and
the
poet
himself
a
cruel
enemy
of
the
sex
one
only
wonders
that
they
could
stand
sophocles
heroines
such
as
antigone
and
jocasta
to
cleverer
men
like
aristophanes
the
case
would
no
doubt
seem
rather
more
complicated
but
aristophanes
amid
the
many
flashes
of
sympathy
he
shows
for
advanced
women
was
not
the
man
to
go
against
his
solid
conservative
audience
or
to
forgo
such
rich
material
for
jokes
in
any
case
this
is
the
kind
of
picture
we
have
of
euripides
in
his
last
years
a
figure
solitary
austere
with
a
few
close
intimates
wrapped
up
in
living
for
what
he
would
call
the
service
of
the
muses
in
music
poetry
and
speculation
capable
still
of
thrilling
his
audiences
with
an
intensity
of
tragic
emotion
such
as
no
other
poet
had
ever
reached
but
bowed
with
age
somewhat
friendless
and
like
other
solitaries
a
little
strange
in
his
habits
uncomprehendingly
admired
and
hated
and
moving
always
through
a
mist
of
laughter
et
one
is
reminded
amid
many
differences
of
the
quaint
words
in
which
william
the
silent
describes
his
own
passage
from
youth
to
age
till
the
brilliant
catholic
prince
leader
of
courts
and
tourneys
sate
at
last
in
his
lonely
council
chamber
bald
and
a
calvinist
let
us
try
to
trace
the
path
of
life
which
led
him
to
this
end
he
was
the
son
of
mnesarchus
or
mnesarchides
such
names
often
have
alternative
forms
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
merchant
his
mother
cleito
the
supposed
greengrocer
was
according
to
philochorus
of
very
high
birth
he
was
born
at
phlya
a
village
in
the
centre
of
attica
the
neighbourhood
is
celebrated
still
for
its
pleasant
trees
and
streams
in
the
midst
of
a
sunburnt
land
in
euripides
time
it
was
more
famous
for
its
temples
it
was
the
seat
of
demeter
anesidora
earth
upsender
of
gifts
of
dionysus
of
the
blossom
and
the
dread
virgins
and
mysterious
names
not
like
the
prevailing
gods
of
the
homeric
mythology
most
famous
of
all
it
possessed
the
mystery
temple
of
erôs
or
love
owing
to
the
researches
of
recent
years
these
mysteries
can
now
be
in
their
general
nature
understood
they
are
survivals
of
an
old
tribal
society
in
which
all
the
boys
as
they
reached
maturity
were
made
to
pass
through
certain
ordeals
and
initiations
they
were
connected
both
with
vegetation
and
with
after
death
because
they
dated
from
a
remote
age
in
which
the
fruitfulness
of
the
tribal
fields
was
not
differentiated
from
the
fruitfulness
of
the
flocks
and
the
human
families
and
the
new
members
born
into
the
community
were
normally
supposed
to
be
the
old
ancestors
returning
to
their
homes
by
euripides
day
such
beliefs
had
faded
into
mystical
doctrines
to
be
handled
with
speechless
reverence
not
to
be
questioned
or
understood
but
they
had
their
influence
upon
his
mind
there
were
other
temples
too
belonging
to
the
more
aristocratic
gods
of
heroic
mythology
as
embodied
in
homer
euripides
was
in
his
youth
to
a
certain
guild
of
dancers
dancing
in
ancient
times
had
always
religious
associations
about
it
who
were
chosen
from
the
first
families
in
athens
and
danced
round
the
altar
of
the
delian
apollo
he
was
also
to
the
apollo
of
cape
zôstêr
that
is
it
was
his
office
to
carry
a
torch
in
the
procession
which
on
a
certain
night
of
each
year
met
the
delian
apollo
at
cape
zôstêr
and
escorted
him
on
his
mystic
path
from
delos
to
athens
when
the
child
was
four
years
old
he
had
to
be
hurried
away
from
his
home
and
then
from
his
country
the
persians
were
coming
the
awful
words
lost
none
of
their
terror
from
the
fact
that
in
greek
the
word
persai
persians
meant
to
destroy
so
later
it
added
something
to
the
dread
inspired
by
rome
that
her
name
roma
meant
strength
the
family
must
have
crossed
the
narrow
seas
to
salamis
or
further
and
seen
the
smoke
of
the
persian
conflagrations
rising
daily
from
new
towns
and
villages
of
attica
and
at
last
from
the
acropolis
or
citadel
itself
then
came
the
enormous
desperate
the
incredible
victory
the
sight
of
the
broken
oriental
fleet
beating
sullenly
away
for
asia
and
safety
and
the
solemn
exclamation
of
the
athenian
general
themistocles
it
is
not
we
who
have
done
this
the
next
year
the
athenians
could
return
to
attica
and
begin
to
build
up
their
ruined
farms
then
came
the
final
defeat
of
the
persian
land
army
at
plataea
and
the
whole
atmosphere
lifted
athens
felt
that
she
had
acted
like
a
hero
and
was
reaping
a
hero
reward
she
had
borne
the
full
brunt
of
the
war
she
had
voluntarily
put
herself
under
the
orders
of
sparta
rather
than
risk
a
split
in
the
greek
forces
and
now
she
had
come
out
as
the
undisputed
mistress
of
the
sea
the
obvious
champion
round
whom
the
eastern
greeks
must
rally
sparta
not
interested
in
matters
outside
her
own
borders
and
not
capable
of
any
constructive
policy
dropped
sulkily
out
and
left
her
to
carry
on
the
offensive
war
for
the
liberation
of
the
greeks
in
asia
the
current
of
things
was
with
her
but
this
great
result
was
not
merely
the
triumph
of
a
particular
city
it
was
the
triumph
of
an
ideal
and
a
way
of
life
freedom
had
defeated
despotism
democracy
had
defeated
kings
hardy
poverty
had
defeated
all
the
gold
of
the
east
the
men
who
fought
of
their
free
will
for
home
and
country
had
proved
more
lasting
fighters
than
the
conscripts
who
were
kept
in
the
lines
by
fear
of
tortures
and
beheadings
and
impalements
above
all
virtue
as
the
greeks
called
it
or
virtue
and
wisdom
together
had
shown
their
power
the
words
raise
a
smile
in
us
indeed
our
words
do
not
properly
correspond
with
the
greek
because
we
can
not
get
our
ideas
simple
enough
virtue
is
what
makes
a
man
or
anything
else
good
it
is
the
quality
of
a
good
soldier
a
good
general
a
good
citizen
a
good
bootmaker
a
good
horse
or
almost
a
good
sword
and
wisdom
is
that
by
which
a
man
knows
how
to
do
things
to
use
a
spear
or
a
tool
to
think
and
speak
and
write
to
do
figures
and
history
and
geometry
to
advise
and
convince
his
all
these
great
forces
moved
or
so
it
seemed
at
the
time
in
the
same
direction
and
probably
it
was
hardly
felt
as
a
dangerous
difference
when
many
people
preferred
to
say
that
it
was
piety
that
had
won
in
the
war
against
impiety
and
that
the
persians
had
been
destroyed
because
being
monotheists
they
had
denied
the
gods
no
doubt
piety
properly
understood
was
a
kind
of
wisdom
let
us
take
a
few
passages
from
the
old
ionian
historian
herodotus
to
illustrate
what
the
feeling
for
athens
was
in
euripides
youth
athens
represented
hellenism
i
the
greek
race
was
distinguished
of
old
from
the
barbarian
as
more
intelligent
and
more
emancipated
from
silly
nonsense
or
and
of
all
the
greeks
the
athenians
were
counted
first
in
wisdom
athens
as
the
old
epigram
put
it
was
the
hellas
of
hellas
and
this
superior
wisdom
went
with
freedom
and
democracy
so
athens
grew
it
is
clear
wherever
you
test
it
what
a
good
thing
is
equality
among
men
athens
under
the
tyrants
was
no
better
than
her
neighbours
even
in
war
when
freed
from
the
tyrants
she
was
far
the
first
of
all
v
and
what
did
this
freedom
and
democracy
mean
a
speaker
in
herodotus
tells
us
iii
a
tyrant
disturbs
ancient
laws
violates
women
kills
men
without
trial
but
a
people
ruling
first
the
very
name
of
it
is
beautiful
and
secondly
a
people
does
none
of
these
things
and
the
freedom
is
not
mere
licence
when
xerxes
heard
the
small
numbers
of
the
greeks
who
were
opposed
to
him
he
asked
why
they
did
not
all
run
away
especially
as
you
say
they
are
free
and
there
is
no
one
to
stop
them
and
the
spartan
answered
they
are
free
o
king
but
not
free
to
do
everything
for
there
is
a
master
over
them
named
law
whom
they
fear
more
than
thy
servants
fear
thee
vii
this
refers
specially
to
the
spartans
but
the
same
tale
is
told
by
aeschylus
of
the
athenians
it
applies
to
any
free
greeks
as
against
the
enslaved
barbarian
the
free
athenian
must
also
have
virtue
he
must
be
a
better
man
in
all
senses
than
the
common
herd
as
themistocles
put
it
at
every
turn
of
life
there
is
a
choice
between
a
higher
and
a
lower
and
they
must
choose
the
higher
always
especially
there
is
one
sense
in
which
athens
must
profess
the
sense
of
generosity
or
chivalry
when
the
various
greek
states
were
contending
for
the
leadership
before
the
battle
of
artemisium
the
athenians
though
contributing
much
the
largest
fleet
thought
that
the
great
thing
was
that
greece
should
be
saved
and
gave
up
their
claims
viii
in
the
similar
dispute
for
the
post
of
honour
and
danger
before
the
battle
of
plataea
the
athenians
did
plead
their
cause
and
won
it
but
they
pleaded
promising
to
abide
loyally
by
sparta
decision
if
their
claims
were
rejected
and
their
arguments
show
what
ideal
they
had
formed
of
themselves
they
claim
that
in
recent
years
they
alone
have
met
the
persians
on
behalf
of
all
greece
that
in
old
times
it
was
they
who
gave
refuge
to
the
children
of
heracles
when
hunted
through
greece
by
the
tyrant
eurystheus
it
was
they
who
at
the
cost
of
war
prevented
the
conquering
thebans
from
leaving
their
dead
enemies
to
rot
unburied
and
thus
offending
against
the
laws
of
greece
and
humanity
this
is
the
light
in
which
athens
conceived
herself
the
ideal
up
to
which
amid
much
confused
and
patriotism
she
strove
to
live
she
was
to
be
the
saviour
of
hellas
euripides
was
about
eight
when
the
ruined
walls
of
athens
were
rebuilt
and
the
city
no
longer
defenceless
against
her
neighbours
could
begin
to
rebuild
the
house
of
athena
on
the
acropolis
and
restore
the
temples
and
the
festivals
throughout
attica
he
can
hardly
have
been
present
when
the
general
themistocles
then
at
the
height
of
his
fame
provided
the
chorus
for
the
earliest
of
the
great
tragedians
phrynichus
in
but
he
must
have
watched
the
new
paintings
being
put
up
by
the
same
themistocles
in
the
temples
at
phlya
with
scenes
from
the
persian
war
and
through
his
early
teens
he
must
have
watched
the
far
more
famous
series
of
pictures
with
which
polygnôtus
the
first
of
the
great
greek
painters
was
adorning
the
acropolis
pictures
that
canonized
scenes
from
the
siege
of
troy
and
other
legendary
history
when
he
was
ten
he
may
probably
have
seen
a
curious
procession
which
brought
back
from
the
island
of
skyros
the
bones
of
theseus
the
mythical
king
of
athens
and
the
accepted
symbol
king
though
he
was
of
athenian
enlightenment
and
democracy
athens
was
now
too
great
and
too
to
allow
theseus
to
lie
on
foreign
soil
when
he
was
twelve
he
may
have
seen
aeschylus
the
one
great
play
dealing
with
an
historical
event
that
exists
in
literature
when
he
was
seventeen
he
pretty
certainly
saw
the
against
and
was
much
influenced
by
it
but
the
choregus
this
time
was
a
new
statesman
pericles
themistocles
was
in
banishment
and
the
other
great
heroes
of
the
persian
time
aristides
and
miltiades
dead
next
year
euripides
became
officially
an
ephêbus
or
youth
he
was
provided
with
a
shield
and
spear
and
set
to
garrison
and
police
duty
in
the
frontier
forts
of
attica
full
military
service
was
to
follow
in
two
years
meantime
the
current
of
his
thoughts
must
have
received
a
shock
for
while
his
shield
and
spear
were
still
fresh
news
came
of
one
of
the
most
stunning
military
disasters
in
athenian
history
a
large
colony
which
had
been
established
on
the
river
strymon
in
thrace
had
been
lured
into
dangerous
country
by
the
thracian
tribes
then
set
upon
by
overwhelming
numbers
and
massacred
to
the
number
of
ten
thousand
no
wonder
that
one
of
euripides
earliest
plays
when
he
took
to
writing
was
the
story
of
the
thracian
and
his
rushing
hordes
of
wild
tribesmen
but
meantime
euripides
had
not
found
his
work
in
life
we
hear
that
he
was
a
good
athlete
there
were
records
of
his
in
athens
and
in
eleusis
probably
every
ambitious
boy
in
greece
did
a
good
deal
of
running
and
boxing
more
serious
was
his
attempt
at
painting
polygnôtus
was
at
work
in
athens
and
the
whole
art
advancing
by
leaps
and
bounds
he
tried
to
find
his
true
work
there
and
paintings
by
his
hand
were
discovered
by
antiquarians
of
later
times
or
so
they
believed
in
the
town
of
megara
his
writings
show
a
certain
interest
in
painting
here
and
there
and
it
is
perhaps
the
painter
in
him
that
worked
out
in
the
construction
of
his
dramas
such
fine
and
varied
effects
of
grouping
but
there
was
more
in
the
air
than
painting
and
sculpture
the
youth
of
euripides
fell
in
an
age
which
saw
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
intellectual
awakening
known
to
human
history
it
had
been
preparing
for
about
a
century
in
certain
cities
of
ionian
greece
on
the
coast
of
asia
minor
rich
and
cultivated
states
subject
for
the
most
part
to
lydian
or
persian
governors
the
revolt
of
these
cities
and
its
suppression
by
persia
had
sent
numbers
of
ionian
wise
men
philosophers
poets
artists
historians
men
of
science
to
seek
for
refuge
in
greece
and
especially
in
athens
athens
was
held
to
be
the
of
all
the
ionian
colonies
and
had
been
their
only
champion
in
the
revolt
she
became
now
as
one
of
these
ionian
exiles
put
it
the
hearth
on
which
the
fire
of
hellas
burned
it
is
difficult
to
describe
this
great
movement
in
a
few
pages
but
one
can
perhaps
get
some
idea
of
it
by
an
imaginary
comparison
imagine
first
the
sort
of
life
that
was
led
in
remote
parts
of
yorkshire
or
somerset
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
stagnant
rustic
life
with
no
moving
ideas
and
unquestioning
in
its
obedience
to
authority
in
which
hardly
any
one
could
read
except
the
parson
and
the
parson
reading
was
not
of
a
kind
to
stir
a
pulse
and
next
imagine
the
intellectual
ferment
which
was
then
in
progress
in
london
or
paris
the
philosophers
painters
historians
and
men
of
science
the
voices
proclaiming
that
all
men
were
equal
that
the
laws
of
england
were
unjust
to
the
poor
that
slavery
was
a
crime
and
that
monarchy
was
a
false
form
of
government
or
that
no
action
was
morally
wrong
except
what
tended
to
produce
human
misery
imagine
then
what
would
occur
in
the
mind
of
a
clever
and
boy
who
was
brought
suddenly
from
the
one
society
into
the
heart
of
the
second
and
made
to
realise
that
the
battles
and
duties
and
prizes
of
life
were
tenfold
more
thrilling
and
important
than
he
had
ever
dreamed
that
is
the
kind
of
awakening
that
must
have
occurred
in
the
minds
of
a
large
part
of
the
greek
people
in
the
early
fifth
century
a
thoroughly
backward
peasant
in
a
greek
village
even
an
attic
village
like
phlya
had
probably
as
few
ideas
as
other
uneducated
peasants
in
athens
some
fifty
years
later
we
hear
that
it
was
impossible
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
to
find
any
one
who
could
not
read
or
write
ff
but
the
difference
in
time
and
place
is
cardinal
the
countryman
who
voted
for
the
banishment
of
aristides
the
just
had
to
ask
some
one
else
to
write
the
name
for
him
such
a
man
did
not
read
nor
yet
think
he
more
or
less
hated
the
next
village
and
regarded
its
misfortunes
as
his
own
advantage
he
was
sunk
in
superstition
his
customs
were
rigid
and
not
understood
he
might
worship
a
goddess
with
a
horse
head
or
a
hero
with
a
snake
tail
he
would
perform
for
the
welfare
of
his
fields
traditional
sacrifices
that
were
often
filthy
and
sometimes
cruel
on
certain
holy
days
he
would
tear
small
beasts
to
pieces
or
drive
them
into
a
fire
in
very
great
extremities
he
would
probably
think
no
medicine
so
good
as
human
blood
his
rules
of
agriculture
would
be
a
mixture
of
rough
common
sense
and
stupid
taboos
he
would
not
reap
till
the
pleiades
were
rising
and
he
would
carefully
avoid
sitting
on
a
fixed
stone
when
he
sought
for
learning
he
would
get
it
in
old
traditional
books
like
which
taught
him
how
ouranos
had
been
mutilated
by
his
son
cronos
and
cronos
bound
with
chains
by
his
son
zeus
how
zeus
was
king
of
gods
and
men
but
had
been
cheated
by
prometheus
into
accepting
bones
instead
of
meat
in
a
sacrifice
he
would
believe
that
tantalus
had
given
the
gods
his
son
pelops
to
eat
to
see
if
they
would
know
the
difference
and
some
of
them
had
eaten
bits
of
him
he
would
perhaps
be
ready
with
great
hesitation
to
tolerate
certain
timid
attempts
to
expurgate
the
story
like
pindar
for
instance
which
results
according
to
our
judgment
in
making
it
rather
worse
and
this
man
rooted
in
his
customs
his
superstitions
his
cruelties
will
of
course
regard
every
departure
from
his
own
way
of
life
as
so
much
pure
wickedness
in
every
contest
that
goes
on
between
intelligence
and
stupidity
between
enlightenment
and
obscurantism
the
powers
of
the
dark
have
this
immense
advantage
they
never
understand
their
opponents
and
consequently
represent
them
as
always
wrong
always
wicked
whereas
the
intelligent
party
generally
makes
an
effort
to
understand
the
stupid
and
to
sympathize
with
anything
that
is
good
or
fine
in
their
attitude
many
of
our
greek
histories
still
speak
as
if
the
great
spiritual
effort
which
created
fifth
century
hellenism
was
a
mass
of
foolish
chatter
and
intellectual
trickery
and
personal
it
was
not
that
nor
anything
like
that
across
the
mind
of
our
stupid
peasant
the
great
national
struggle
against
persia
brought
first
the
idea
that
perhaps
really
it
was
better
to
die
than
to
be
a
slave
that
it
was
well
to
face
death
not
merely
for
his
own
home
but
actually
incredible
as
it
seemed
for
other
people
homes
for
the
homes
of
those
wretched
people
in
the
next
village
our
own
special
customs
and
taboos
he
would
reflect
with
a
shiver
do
not
really
matter
when
they
are
brought
into
conflict
with
a
common
hellenism
or
a
common
humanity
there
are
greater
things
about
us
than
we
knew
there
are
also
greater
men
these
men
who
are
in
everybody
mouth
themistocles
above
all
who
has
defeated
the
persian
and
saved
greece
but
crowds
of
others
besides
aristides
the
just
and
miltiades
the
hero
of
marathon
demokêdes
the
learned
physician
who
was
sought
out
by
people
in
need
of
help
from
italy
to
susa
hecataeus
who
had
made
a
picture
of
the
whole
earth
showing
all
the
countries
and
cities
and
rivers
and
how
far
each
is
from
the
next
and
who
could
have
saved
the
ionians
if
they
had
only
listened
to
him
pythagoras
who
had
discovered
all
about
numbers
and
knew
the
wickedness
of
the
world
and
had
founded
a
society
bound
by
strict
rules
to
combat
it
what
is
it
about
these
men
that
has
made
them
so
different
from
you
and
me
and
the
other
farmers
who
meet
in
the
agora
on
it
is
wisdom
it
is
virtue
they
are
not
a
bit
stronger
in
the
arm
not
bigger
not
richer
or
more
they
are
just
wiser
and
thus
better
men
can
not
we
be
made
wise
we
know
we
are
stupid
we
are
very
ignorant
but
we
can
learn
the
word
sophistes
means
either
one
who
makes
wise
or
possibly
as
some
scholars
think
one
who
deals
in
wisdom
the
difference
is
slight
in
any
case
it
was
in
answer
to
this
call
for
that
the
sophists
arose
doubtless
they
were
of
all
kinds
great
men
and
small
honest
and
dishonest
teachers
of
real
wisdom
and
of
pretence
our
tradition
is
rather
bitter
against
them
because
it
dates
from
the
bitter
time
of
reaction
and
disappointment
when
the
hopes
of
the
fifth
century
and
the
men
who
guided
it
seemed
to
have
led
athens
only
to
her
fall
plato
in
particular
is
against
them
as
he
is
against
athens
herself
in
the
main
the
judgment
of
the
afterworld
upon
them
will
depend
on
the
side
we
take
in
a
battle
they
fought
for
light
and
knowledge
and
freedom
and
the
development
of
all
man
powers
if
we
prefer
blinkers
and
custom
subordination
and
the
rod
we
shall
think
them
dangerous
and
shallow
creatures
but
to
see
what
the
sophists
were
like
let
us
consider
two
of
them
who
are
recorded
as
having
specially
been
the
teachers
of
euripides
anaxagoras
of
clazomenae
in
ionia
was
about
fifteen
years
older
than
euripides
and
spent
some
thirty
years
of
his
life
in
athens
he
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
the
moon
shines
by
the
reflection
of
the
sun
light
and
he
explained
in
the
main
correctly
the
cause
of
eclipses
the
sun
was
not
a
god
it
was
a
mass
of
stone
or
earth
in
size
perfectly
enormous
in
describing
its
probable
size
language
failed
him
he
only
got
as
far
as
saying
what
must
have
seemed
almost
a
mad
exaggeration
that
it
was
many
times
larger
than
the
peloponnese
he
held
if
he
did
not
invent
a
particular
form
of
the
atomic
theory
which
has
played
such
a
great
rôle
in
the
history
of
modern
science
he
was
emphatic
on
the
indestructibility
of
matter
things
could
be
broken
up
into
their
elements
and
could
grow
together
again
but
nothing
could
be
created
or
destroyed
there
was
order
in
the
world
and
purpose
and
this
was
the
work
of
a
conscious
power
which
he
called
nous
or
mind
all
things
were
together
in
a
mass
till
mind
came
and
put
order
into
them
mind
is
outside
things
not
mixed
with
them
and
some
authorities
say
that
anaxagoras
called
it
god
meantime
he
showed
by
experiment
the
reality
and
substance
of
air
and
disproved
the
common
notion
of
empty
space
it
will
be
seen
that
these
ideas
if
often
crudely
expressed
are
essentially
the
same
ideas
which
gave
new
life
to
modern
science
after
the
sleep
of
the
middle
ages
almost
every
one
of
them
is
the
subject
of
active
dispute
at
the
present
day
apart
from
physical
science
we
learn
that
anaxagoras
was
a
close
friend
and
adviser
of
the
great
athenian
statesman
pericles
and
we
have
by
chance
an
account
of
a
long
discussion
between
the
two
men
about
the
theory
of
punishment
whether
the
object
of
it
is
to
do
justice
upon
a
apart
from
any
result
that
may
accrue
or
simply
to
deter
others
from
doing
the
same
and
thus
make
society
better
the
question
is
the
subject
of
a
vigorous
correspondence
in
the
while
these
words
are
writing
we
can
understand
what
an
effect
such
a
teacher
as
this
would
have
on
the
eager
young
man
from
phlya
one
great
word
of
liberation
was
already
in
the
air
and
belongs
to
no
one
sophist
or
philosopher
this
was
the
distinction
between
nature
on
the
one
hand
and
custom
or
convention
on
the
other
the
historian
herodotus
who
was
no
sophist
but
loved
a
good
story
tells
how
the
persian
king
darius
called
some
greeks
and
some
indian
tribesmen
together
into
his
presence
he
then
asked
the
greeks
what
payment
would
induce
them
to
eat
the
dead
bodies
of
their
fathers
nothing
in
the
world
they
cried
in
indignation
they
would
reverently
burn
them
he
proceeded
to
ask
the
indians
what
they
would
take
to
burn
their
fathers
bodies
and
they
repelled
the
bare
thought
with
horror
they
would
do
nothing
but
eat
them
with
every
mark
of
love
and
respect
fire
burns
in
the
same
way
both
here
and
in
persia
the
saying
was
but
men
notions
of
right
and
wrong
are
not
at
all
the
same
the
one
is
nature
the
other
is
man
custom
or
convention
this
antithesis
between
phusis
and
nomos
ran
vividly
through
the
whole
of
greek
philosophy
and
awoke
with
renewed
vigour
in
rousseau
and
the
radical
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
an
antithesis
against
which
conformist
dialecticians
have
always
turned
their
sharpest
weapons
it
has
again
and
again
been
dissected
and
refuted
and
shown
to
be
philosophically
untenable
but
it
still
lives
and
has
still
something
of
the
old
power
to
shatter
and
to
set
free
all
the
thinkers
of
greece
at
the
time
we
are
treating
were
testing
the
laws
and
maxims
of
their
day
and
trying
to
find
out
what
really
rested
on
nature
and
what
was
the
mere
embroidery
of
man
it
is
always
a
dangerous
and
exciting
inquiry
especially
because
the
most
irrational
conventions
are
apt
also
to
be
the
most
sacrosanct
this
whole
spirit
was
specially
incarnate
in
another
of
teachers
we
hear
of
protagoras
in
his
old
age
from
that
enemy
of
the
sophists
plato
but
for
this
sophist
even
plato
satire
is
kindly
and
almost
reverent
protagoras
worked
not
at
physical
science
but
at
language
and
philosophy
he
taught
men
to
think
and
speak
he
began
the
study
of
grammar
by
dividing
sentences
into
four
kinds
optative
interrogative
indicative
imperative
he
taught
rhetoric
he
formulated
the
first
theory
of
democracy
but
it
was
as
a
sceptic
that
he
struck
men
imaginations
most
about
the
gods
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
either
that
they
are
or
are
not
for
the
hindrances
to
knowledge
are
many
the
darkness
of
the
subject
and
the
shortness
of
man
life
numbers
of
people
no
doubt
went
as
far
as
this
and
without
suffering
for
it
as
protagoras
did
but
his
scepticism
cut
deeper
and
raised
questions
still
debated
in
modern
thought
man
is
the
measure
of
things
there
is
no
truth
to
be
had
beyond
the
impression
made
on
a
man
mind
when
this
given
object
seems
one
thing
to
a
and
another
thing
to
b
it
to
each
one
exactly
what
it
seems
just
as
honey
not
only
seems
sweet
but
sweet
to
a
healthy
man
and
not
only
seems
bitter
but
bitter
to
a
man
with
jaundice
then
you
can
not
say
we
may
ask
that
one
or
other
impression
is
false
and
will
prove
false
on
further
inquiry
no
he
answers
each
impression
is
equally
true
the
only
difference
is
that
each
state
of
mind
is
not
equally
good
you
can
not
prove
to
the
jaundiced
man
that
his
honey
is
sweet
for
it
is
not
or
to
the
drunkard
that
he
does
not
desire
his
drink
for
he
does
what
you
can
do
is
to
alter
the
men
state
of
mind
to
cure
the
jaundice
or
the
drunkenness
our
cognition
flows
and
changes
it
is
the
result
of
an
active
impact
upon
a
passive
percipient
and
resulting
from
this
change
there
are
in
practice
always
two
things
to
be
said
a
pro
and
a
con
about
every
possible
proposition
there
is
no
general
statement
that
can
not
be
contradicted
other
teachers
also
are
represented
as
having
influenced
euripides
archelaus
who
tried
to
conceive
anaxagoras
mind
in
some
material
form
as
air
or
spirit
for
of
course
means
breath
prodicus
who
besides
his
discoveries
in
grammar
is
the
author
of
a
popular
and
edifying
fable
which
has
served
in
many
schoolrooms
for
many
centuries
it
tells
how
heracles
once
came
to
some
cross
roads
one
road
open
broad
and
smooth
and
leading
a
little
downhill
the
other
narrow
and
uphill
and
rough
and
on
the
first
you
gradually
became
a
worse
and
worse
man
on
the
second
a
better
one
there
was
diogenes
of
apollonia
whose
theories
about
air
seem
to
have
had
some
effect
on
writings
and
of
course
there
was
among
the
younger
men
socrates
socrates
is
too
great
and
too
enigmatic
a
teacher
to
be
summed
up
in
a
few
sentences
and
though
a
verse
of
ancient
comedy
has
come
down
to
us
saying
socrates
piles
the
faggots
for
euripides
fire
his
influence
on
his
older
friend
is
not
very
conspicuous
euripides
must
have
caught
something
from
his
scepticism
his
indifference
to
worldly
standards
his
strong
purpose
and
something
also
from
his
resolute
rejection
of
all
philosophy
except
that
which
was
concerned
with
the
doings
and
feelings
of
men
the
fields
and
trees
will
not
talk
to
me
it
is
only
the
human
beings
in
the
city
that
will
that
saying
of
socrates
might
be
the
motto
of
many
a
dramatist
the
greatness
of
these
philosophers
or
sophists
of
the
fifth
century
does
not
of
course
lie
in
the
correctness
of
their
scientific
results
the
dullest
and
most
unilluminated
produced
at
the
present
day
is
far
more
correct
than
anaxagoras
their
greatness
lies
partly
in
the
pioneer
quality
of
their
work
they
first
struck
out
the
roads
by
which
later
workers
could
advance
further
partly
in
the
daring
and
felicity
with
which
they
hit
upon
great
and
fruitful
ideas
ideas
which
have
brought
light
and
freedom
with
them
whenever
they
have
recurred
to
minds
and
which
as
we
have
seen
are
to
a
great
extent
still
after
more
than
two
thousand
years
living
issues
in
philosophic
thought
partly
it
lies
in
the
mere
freedom
of
spirit
with
which
they
set
to
work
unhampered
by
fears
and
taboos
to
seek
the
truth
to
create
beauty
and
to
improve
human
life
the
difference
of
atmosphere
between
the
sophists
of
the
periclean
circle
and
the
ordinary
backward
attic
farmer
must
have
been
visible
to
every
observer
if
more
evidence
of
the
great
gulf
was
needed
it
was
supplied
emphatically
enough
in
the
experience
of
euripides
he
was
himself
prosecuted
by
cleon
the
demagogue
for
impiety
the
same
charge
had
been
levelled
even
against
his
far
less
destructive
predecessor
aeschylus
of
these
three
special
friends
whom
we
have
mentioned
euripides
did
not
live
to
see
socrates
condemned
to
death
and
executed
but
he
saw
anaxagoras
in
spite
of
the
protection
of
pericles
accused
of
impiety
and
compelled
to
fly
for
his
life
he
saw
protagoras
for
the
book
which
he
had
read
aloud
in
euripides
own
house
prosecuted
and
condemned
the
book
was
publicly
burned
the
author
escaped
it
is
said
only
to
be
drowned
at
sea
a
signal
mark
in
the
eyes
of
the
orthodox
of
how
the
gods
regarded
such
philosophy
thought
was
no
doubt
freer
in
ancient
athens
than
in
any
other
city
within
two
thousand
years
of
it
those
who
suffered
for
religious
advance
are
exceedingly
few
but
it
was
not
in
human
nature
especially
in
such
early
times
for
individuals
to
do
such
great
service
to
their
fellow
men
and
not
occasionally
be
punished
for
it
they
induced
men
for
a
time
to
set
reason
and
high
ideals
above
the
instincts
of
the
herd
and
sooner
or
later
the
herd
must
turn
and
trample
them
one
of
the
ancient
lives
says
that
it
was
this
sense
of
the
antagonism
between
anaxagoras
and
the
conservative
masses
that
turned
euripides
away
from
philosophy
one
need
scarcely
believe
that
the
way
he
took
was
not
the
way
to
escape
from
danger
or
unpopularity
and
when
a
man
shows
extraordinary
genius
for
poetry
one
need
not
search
for
the
reasons
which
induced
him
not
to
write
prose
he
followed
in
the
wake
not
of
anaxagoras
but
of
aeschylus

euripides
early

alcestis
and
telephus
to
the
public
of
the
present
day
a
play
is
merely
an
entertainment
and
it
was
the
same
to
the
elizabethans
shakespeare
can
say
to
his
audience
our
true
intent
is
all
for
your
delight
and
we
feel
no
particular
shock
in
reading
the
words
the
companies
were
just
noblemen
servants
and
it
was
natural
enough
that
if
lord
leicester
players
did
not
amuse
lord
leicester
guests
they
should
be
sent
away
and
others
hired
if
they
too
proved
dull
the
patron
could
drop
the
play
altogether
and
call
for
tumblers
and
dancing
dogs
to
a
playwright
of
the
twelfth
century
who
worked
out
in
the
church
or
in
front
of
it
his
presentation
of
the
great
drama
of
the
gospel
such
an
attitude
would
have
seemed
debased
and
cynical
however
poor
the
monkish
players
or
playwright
might
be
surely
that
which
they
were
presenting
was
in
itself
enough
to
fill
the
mind
of
a
spectator
to
them
as
the
great
mediævalist
gaston
paris
puts
it
the
universe
was
a
vast
stage
on
which
was
played
an
eternal
drama
full
of
tears
and
joy
its
actors
divided
between
heaven
earth
and
hell
a
drama
whose
end
is
foreseen
whose
changes
of
fortune
are
directed
by
the
hand
of
god
yet
whose
every
scene
is
rich
and
thrilling
the
spectator
was
admitted
to
the
councils
of
the
trinity
he
saw
the
legions
of
darkness
mingling
themselves
with
the
lives
of
humanity
tempting
and
troubling
and
the
saints
and
angels
at
their
work
of
protection
or
intercession
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
kiss
of
judas
the
scourging
and
crucifixion
the
descent
into
hell
the
resurrection
and
ascension
and
lastly
the
dragging
down
to
red
and
bloody
torment
of
the
infinite
multitudes
of
the
unorthodox
or
the
wicked

passed

such

essay
i
now
in
spite
of
a
thousand
differences
of
social
organization
and
religious
dogma
the
atmosphere
of
primitive
greek
tragedy
must
have
been
most
strangely
similar
to
this
it
is
not
only
that
like
the
mediæval
plays
greek
tragedy
was
religious
that
it
was
developed
out
of
a
definite
ritual
not
even
that
the
most
marked
links
of
historical
continuity
can
be
traced
between
the
ritual
of
certain
pagan
saviours
and
those
of
the
mediæval
drama
it
is
that
the
ritual
on
which
tragedy
was
based
embodied
the
most
fundamental
greek
conceptions
of
life
and
fate
of
law
and
sin
and
punishment
when
we
say
that
tragedy
originated
in
a
dance
ritual
or
magical
intended
to
represent
the
death
of
the
vegetation
this
year
and
its
coming
return
in
triumph
next
year
the
above
remarks
may
seem
hard
to
justify
but
we
must
remember
several
things
first
a
dance
was
in
ancient
times
essentially
religious
not
a
mere
capering
with
the
feet
but
an
attempt
to
express
with
every
limb
and
sinew
of
the
body
those
emotions
for
which
words
especially
the
words
of
simple
and
unlettered
men
are
inadequate
see
again
vegetation
is
to
us
an
abstract
common
noun
to
the
ancient
it
was
a
personal
being
not
it
but
he
his
death
was
as
our
own
deaths
and
his
a
thing
to
be
anxiously
sought
with
prayers
and
dances
for
if
he
were
not
what
would
happen
famine
and
wholesale
death
by
famine
was
a
familiar
thought
a
regularly
returning
terror
in
these
primitive
agricultural
villages
nay
more
why
must
the
cycle
of
summer
and
winter
roll
as
it
does
why
must
he
die
and
men
die
some
of
the
oldest
greek
philosophers
have
no
doubt
about
the
answer
there
has
been
hubris
or
adikia
pride
or
injustice
and
the
result
thereof
must
needs
be
death
every
year
he
waxes
too
strong
and
commits
hubris
and
such
sin
has
its
proper
punishment
the
sun
shall
not
transgress
his
measures
says
heraclitus
if
he
does
he
shall
be
pursued
by
erinyes
till
justice
be
it
is
the
law
of
all
existing
things
they
all
pay
retribution
for
injustice
one
to
another
according
to
the
ordinance
of
time
fr
fr
and
the
history
of
each
year
bloom
was
an
example
of
this
refluent
balance
the
year
daemon
vegetation
spirit
or
corn
god
or
whatever
we
call
him
waxes
proud
and
is
slain
by
his
enemy
who
becomes
thereby
a
murderer
and
must
in
turn
perish
at
the
hands
of
the
expected
avenger
who
is
at
the
same
time
the
wronged
one
the
ritual
of
this
vegetation
spirit
is
extraordinarily
in
all
quarters
of
the
globe
and
may
best
be
studied
in
frazer
especially
in
the
part
entitled
dying
dionysus
the
daemon
of
tragedy
is
one
of
these
dying
gods
like
attis
adonis
osiris
the
dionysiac
ritual
which
lay
at
the
back
of
tragedy
may
be
conjectured
in
its
full
form
to
have
had
six
regular
stages
an
agôn
or
contest
in
which
the
dæmon
fights
against
his
enemy
who
since
it
is
really
this
year
fighting
last
year
is
apt
to
be
almost
identical
with
himself
a
pathos
or
disaster
which
very
commonly
takes
the
shape
of
a
sparagmos
or
tearing
in
pieces
the
body
of
the
corn
god
being
scattered
in
innumerable
seeds
over
the
earth
sometimes
of
some
other
sacrificial
death
a
messenger
who
brings
the
news
a
lamentation
very
often
mixed
with
a
song
of
rejoicing
since
the
death
of
the
old
king
is
also
the
accession
of
the
new
the
discovery
or
recognition
of
the
hidden
or
dismembered
god
and
his
epiphany
or
resurrection
in
glory
footnote
the
above
is
the
present
writer
published
in
miss
harrison
pp
of
the
orthodox
view
of
the
origin
of
tragedy
also
cornford
religion
to
first
few
chapters
the
chief
theory
is
professor
ridgeway
who
derives
tragedy
directly
from
the
funeral
cult
of
individual
heroes
of
cambridge
this
ritual
of
dionysus
being
made
into
a
drama
and
falling
into
the
hands
of
a
remarkable
set
of
creative
artists
developed
into
what
we
know
as
greek
tragedy
the
creative
passion
of
the
artist
gradually
conquered
the
emotion
of
the
mere
worshipper
exactly
the
same
development
took
place
in
mediæval
drama
or
rather
it
was
taking
place
when
new
secular
influences
broke
in
and
destroyed
it
the
liturgical
plays
first
enacted
the
main
story
of
the
new
testament
then
they
emphasized
particular
parts
there
is
a
beautiful
play
for
instance
on
the
massacre
of
the
innocents
then
they
developed
imaginatively
scenes
that
are
implied
but
not
mentioned
in
the
gospel
such
as
the
experiences
of
the
magdalen
when
she
lived
in
joy
her
dealings
with
and
the
like
then
ranging
right
outside
the
gospel
histories
they
dealt
with
the
lives
of
nicholas
antony
or
any
person
who
provided
a
good
legend
and
had
some
claim
to
an
atmosphere
of
sanctity
in
the
same
way
greek
tragedy
extended
its
range
first
to
embrace
the
histories
of
other
heroes
or
daemons
the
difference
is
slight
who
were
essentially
like
dionysus
pentheus
lycurgus
hippolytus
actaeon
and
especially
i
should
be
inclined
to
add
orestes
then
it
took
in
any
heroes
to
whose
memory
some
ritual
was
attached
for
the
play
is
with
the
rarest
and
most
doubtful
exceptions
essentially
the
enactment
of
a
ritual
or
rather
of
what
the
greeks
called
an
aition
that
is
a
supposed
historical
event
which
is
the
origin
or
cause
of
the
ritual
thus
the
death
of
hippolytus
is
the
aition
of
the
performed
at
the
grave
of
hippolytus
the
death
of
aias
is
the
aition
of
the
festival
called
aianteia
the
death
of
medea
children
the
aition
of
a
certain
ritual
at
corinth
the
story
of
prometheus
the
aition
of
a
certain
in
athens
the
tragedy
as
ritual
enacts
its
own
legendary
origin
there
is
then
a
further
extension
of
the
theme
to
include
a
very
few
events
in
recent
history
but
we
must
observe
that
only
those
events
were
chosen
which
were
felt
to
have
about
them
some
heroic
grandeur
or
mystery
i
think
we
may
even
say
only
those
events
which
like
the
battle
of
salamis
or
the
fall
of
miletus
had
been
made
the
subject
of
some
religious
celebration
however
that
may
be
the
general
temper
of
tragedy
moved
strongly
away
from
the
monotony
of
fixed
ritual
the
subjects
thus
grew
richer
and
more
varied
the
mode
of
representation
loftier
and
more
artistic
what
had
begun
as
almost
pure
ritual
ended
by
being
almost
pure
drama
by
the
time
euripides
began
to
write
the
aeschylus
had
already
lifted
greek
drama
to
its
highest
level
whole
generations
have
read
his
plays
without
even
suspecting
the
ritual
form
that
lies
behind
them
aeschylus
had
also
made
the
whole
performance
much
longer
and
more
impressive
he
composed
three
continuous
tragedies
forming
a
single
whole
and
followed
by
the
strange
performance
called
a
the
wild
element
of
revelry
which
was
proper
to
dionysus
worship
with
its
bearded
dancing
satyrs
had
been
kept
severely
away
from
the
stage
during
the
three
tragedies
and
must
burst
in
to
have
its
fling
when
they
were
finished
the
other
tragedians
do
not
seem
to
have
written
in
trilogies
and
euripides
at
any
rate
moved
gradually
away
from
in
their
stead
he
put
a
curious
sort
of
tragedy
a
play
in
the
tragic
convention
and
free
from
the
satyric
coarseness
but
containing
at
least
one
figure
and
preserving
some
fantastic
quality
of
atmosphere
on
the
great
festival
of
dionysus
each
year
and
sometimes
on
other
festivals
this
ritual
of
tragedy
was
solemnly
performed
in
the
theatre
of
the
god
like
most
greek
festivals
the
performance
took
the
form
of
a
competition
the
ground
of
this
custom
was
i
suspect
religious
it
was
desired
to
get
a
spirit
of
nikê
or
victory
into
the
celebration
and
you
could
only
get
this
by
means
of
a
contest
the
archon
or
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
festival
selected
three
poets
to
compete
and
three
rich
men
to
be
their
chorêgoi
that
is
to
provide
all
the
expenses
of
the
performance
the
poet
was
then
said
to
have
obtained
a
chorus
and
his
work
now
was
to
teach
the
chorus
at
the
end
of
the
festival
a
body
of
five
judges
somewhat
elaborately
and
curiously
chosen
awarded
a
first
second
and
third
prize
even
the
last
competitor
must
have
a
kind
of
victory
any
mention
of
failure
at
such
a
time
would
be
this
in
rough
outline
was
the
official
mould
in
which
our
creative
activity
had
to
run
the
record
of
his
early
work
is
as
we
had
reason
to
expect
terribly
defective
but
we
do
happen
to
know
the
name
and
subject
of
the
first
play
for
which
he
was
granted
a
chorus
it
was
called
the
of
its
story
was
based
on
the
old
ritual
of
the
who
is
cut
to
pieces
or
scattered
like
the
seed
and
then
restored
to
life
and
youth
medea
the
enchantress
maiden
from
the
further
shores
of
the
friendless
sea
had
fled
from
her
home
with
the
greek
adventurer
jason
the
winner
of
the
golden
fleece
she
came
with
him
to
thessaly
where
his
uncle
pelias
was
king
pelias
had
usurped
jason
ancestral
crown
and
therefore
hated
him
the
daughters
of
pelias
doubtless
sneered
at
medea
and
encouraged
jason
growing
distaste
for
his
barbarian
prize
the
savage
woman
determined
at
one
blow
to
be
rid
of
pelias
to
punish
his
daughters
and
reconquer
love
she
had
the
power
of
renovating
the
life
of
the
old
she
persuaded
the
daughters
of
pelias
to
try
her
method
on
their
father
with
the
result
that
he
died
in
agony
and
they
stood
guilty
of
a
hideous
murder
medea
we
may
conjecture
was
triumphant
till
she
found
she
had
made
jason
a
ruined
man
and
taught
him
really
to
hate
her
the
play
is
characteristic
in
two
ways
it
was
clearly
based
on
the
old
ritual
and
it
treated
one
of
euripides
great
subjects
the
passions
of
a
suffering
and
savage
woman
the
of
was
produced
in
when
the
poet
was
just
a
year
after
the
death
of
aeschylus
and
thirteen
years
after
the
first
victory
of
sophocles
euripides
own
first
victory
we
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
successful
play
did
not
come
till
a
year
before
sophocles
masterpiece
the
we
have
only
two
examples
and
those
not
certain
of
euripides
work
before
that
time
the
is
a
pure
and
simple
and
the
only
complete
specimen
of
its
class
it
is
probably
earlier
than
the
and
is
interesting
because
it
shows
euripides
writing
for
once
without
any
or
secondary
intention
it
is
a
gay
and
grotesque
piece
based
on
homer
story
of
odysseus
in
the
cave
the
farcical
and
fantastic
note
is
firmly
held
so
that
the
climax
of
the
story
in
which
the
monster
eye
is
burnt
out
with
a
log
of
burning
wood
is
kept
unreal
and
not
disgusting
the
later
euripides
would
probably
have
made
it
horrible
and
swung
our
sympathies
violently
round
to
the
side
of
the
victim
the
has
come
down
to
us
in
a
very
peculiar
condition
and
is
often
considered
spurious
we
know
however
that
euripides
wrote
a
and
tradition
says
that
he
was
very
young
when
he
wrote
it
my
own
view
explained
in
the
preface
to
my
translation
would
make
it
probably
a
very
early
play
which
was
produced
after
the
poet
death
and
considerably
rewritten
it
is
a
young
man
play
full
of
war
and
adventure
of
spies
in
and
white
chargers
and
gallant
chivalry
that
is
not
much
like
the
euripides
whom
we
know
elsewhere
but
his
mark
is
upon
the
last
scene
in
which
the
soldiers
stand
embarrassed
and
silent
while
a
solitary
mother
weeps
over
her
dead
son
the
poetry
of
the
scene
is
exquisite
but
what
is
most
characteristic
is
the
sudden
flavour
of
bitterness
the
cold
wind
that
so
suddenly
takes
the
heart
out
of
joyous
war
some
touch
of
that
bitter
flavour
will
be
found
hereafter
in
every
play
however
beautiful
or
romantic
that
comes
from
the
pen
of
euripides
up
to
the
year
when
the
poet
was
the
records
as
we
have
said
almost
fail
us
but
in
that
year
he
produced
a
set
of
four
plays
cretan
in
and
in
place
of
a
the
the
last
is
still
extant
and
is
very
characteristic
of
the
master
mind
the
saga
told
how
admetus
a
king
in
thessaly
was
fated
to
die
on
a
certain
day
but
in
return
for
his
piety
of
old
was
allowed
to
find
a
substitute
to
die
for
him
his
old
father
and
mother
refused
his
young
wife
alcestis
gladly
consented
to
die
amid
exquisite
songs
of
mourning
she
is
carried
to
her
grave
when
the
wild
hero
heracles
comes
to
the
house
seeking
hospitality
admetus
with
primitive
courtesy
conceals
what
has
happened
and
orders
him
to
be
given
entertainment
the
burial
is
finished
when
heracles
already
revelling
and
drunken
and
crowned
with
flowers
learns
the
truth
sobered
at
the
touch
he
goes
out
into
the
night
to
wrestle
with
death
amid
the
tombs
and
crush
his
ribs
for
him
till
he
yields
up
his
prey
one
sees
the
fantastic
satyr
note
the
play
is
not
truly
tragic
it
touches
its
theme
tenderly
and
with
romance
but
amid
all
the
romance
euripides
can
not
keep
his
hand
from
unveiling
the
weak
spot
in
the
sacred
legend
alcestis
no
doubt
is
beautiful
and
it
was
beautiful
of
her
to
die
but
what
was
it
of
admetus
to
let
her
die
an
ordinary
playwright
would
elude
the
awkward
question
admetus
would
refuse
his
wife
sacrifice
and
she
would
perform
it
against
his
will
or
without
his
knowledge
we
should
somehow
save
our
hero
character
not
so
euripides
his
admetus
weeps
tenderly
over
his
wife
but
he
thinks
it
entirely
suitable
that
she
should
die
for
him
the
veil
is
not
removed
from
his
eyes
till
his
old
father
pheres
who
has
bluntly
refused
to
die
for
anybody
comes
to
bring
offerings
to
alcestis
funeral
a
quarrel
breaks
out
between
the
two
selfish
men
brilliantly
written
subtle
and
merciless
in
which
admetus
weakness
is
laid
bare
the
scene
is
a
great
grief
to
the
purely
romantic
reader
but
it
just
makes
the
play
profound
instead
of
superficial
all
the
plays
of
are
in
different
ways
typical
of
their
author
and
we
will
spend
a
little
time
on
each
the
in
was
what
we
should
call
a
romance
alcmaeon
was
the
son
of
that
eriphyle
who
betrayed
her
husband
to
death
for
the
sake
of
a
charmed
necklace
which
had
once
belonged
to
harmonia
the
daughter
of
ares
alcmaeon
slew
his
mother
and
became
in
consequence
mad
and
accursed
seeking
purification
he
fled
to
the
land
of
psôphis
where
the
king
cleansed
him
and
gave
him
the
hand
of
his
daughter
arsinoë
who
duly
received
the
necklace
however
alcmaeon
sin
was
too
great
for
any
such
cleansing
he
wandered
away
all
the
earth
being
accursed
to
him
till
he
should
find
some
land
that
had
not
been
in
existence
at
the
time
of
his
sin
and
was
consequently
unpolluted
he
discovered
it
in
some
alluvial
islands
just
then
making
their
appearance
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
acheloüs
here
he
at
last
found
peace
and
married
the
daughter
of
acheloüs
callirrhoë
she
asks
for
the
necklace
and
alcmaeon
goes
back
to
get
it
from
arsinoë
he
professes
to
need
it
for
his
own
purification
and
she
willingly
gives
it
him
then
she
finds
that
he
really
wants
it
for
his
new
bride
and
in
fury
has
him
murdered
on
his
road
home
a
romantic
and
varied
story
with
one
fine
touch
of
tragic
passion
the
also
deserves
special
mention
it
had
apparently
the
misfortune
to
be
seen
by
aristophanes
then
a
boy
about
sixteen
at
any
rate
the
comedian
was
never
able
to
forget
it
and
we
know
it
chiefly
from
his
parodies
it
struck
out
a
new
style
in
attic
drama
the
style
of
adventure
and
which
threw
to
the
winds
the
traditional
tragic
dignities
and
pomps
the
usual
convention
in
tragedy
was
to
clothe
the
characters
in
elaborate
priestly
dress
with
ritual
masks
carefully
graduated
according
to
the
rank
of
the
character
such
trappings
came
to
tragedy
as
an
inheritance
from
its
old
days
and
it
never
quite
succeeded
in
throwing
them
off
even
in
its
most
vital
period
it
is
very
difficult
for
us
to
form
a
clear
notion
what
the
ordinary
greek
tragedy
looked
like
in
and
how
much
we
should
have
noticed
any
great
change
of
dressing
in
the
but
there
was
a
change
which
raised
a
storm
of
comment
telephus
was
a
king
of
mysia
not
very
far
from
the
troad
the
greeks
in
sailing
for
troy
had
missed
their
way
and
invaded
telephus
country
by
mistake
he
had
fought
them
with
great
effect
but
had
been
wounded
by
achilles
with
his
magic
spear
the
wound
would
not
close
and
an
oracle
told
telephus
the
wounder
shall
heal
the
greeks
were
back
in
greece
by
this
time
planning
a
new
invasion
of
troy
the
king
goes
lame
and
disguised
as
a
beggar
into
the
heart
of
the
greek
army
and
into
agamemnon
palace
euripides
since
the
king
had
to
be
a
beggar
dressed
him
as
a
beggar
with
rags
and
a
wallet
it
is
hard
to
see
how
he
could
possibly
have
done
otherwise
but
we
may
surmise
that
his
beggar
dress
was
a
little
more
realistic
and
less
merely
symbolical
than
his
audience
expected
in
any
case
though
critics
were
shocked
the
practice
established
itself
telephus
and
philoctêtes
were
afterwards
regularly
allowed
to
dress
in
rags
even
in
the
work
of
sophocles
there
were
great
scenes
owing
to
the
boldness
of
the
ragged
and
intrusive
stranger
the
greek
chieftains
proposed
to
kill
him
but
granted
him
at
last
the
right
of
making
one
speech
to
save
his
life
he
seems
to
have
spoken
beside
or
over
the
headsman
block
and
the
case
he
had
to
plead
was
characteristic
of
euripides
the
greeks
considered
quite
simply
that
telephus
was
their
enemy
and
must
be
destroyed
on
their
next
expedition
the
beggar
explained
that
telephus
had
found
his
country
ravaged
and
was
bound
to
defend
it
every
man
among
the
greeks
would
have
done
the
same
there
is
nothing
to
blame
telephus
for
at
the
end
of
this
scene
apparently
the
beggar
was
discovered
it
is
telephus
himself
speaking
they
fly
to
their
spears
but
telephus
has
snatched
up
the
baby
prince
orestes
from
his
cradle
and
stands
at
bay
if
one
of
his
enemies
moves
the
child
shall
die
eventually
they
accept
his
terms
and
make
peace
with
him
a
fine
melodrama
one
would
guess
and
a
move
in
the
direction
of
realism
a
direction
which
euripides
only
followed
within
certain
strict
limits
but
we
find
two
marks
of
euripides
the
philosopher
the
beggar
who
pleads
for
reasonable
justice
towards
the
national
enemy
strikes
a
note
which
euripides
himself
often
had
to
sound
afterwards
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
aristophanes
in
his
thirteen
years
later
used
a
parody
of
this
scene
in
order
to
plead
the
dangerous
cause
of
reasonableness
towards
sparta
the
other
mark
is
a
curious
tang
of
sadness
at
the
close
the
greeks
demand
that
telephus
so
brave
and
resourceful
shall
be
their
ally
against
troy
but
his
wife
is
a
trojan
princess
and
he
refuses
he
consents
reluctantly
to
show
the
army
the
road
to
his
wife
fatherland
and
then
turns
away
the
remaining
play
of
the
trilogy
performed
in
strikes
a
chord
that
proved
more
dangerous
to
euripides
the
told
the
story
of
aëropê
a
cretan
princess
who
secretly
loved
a
squire
or
young
soldier
her
intrigue
is
discovered
and
her
father
gives
her
to
a
greek
sailor
to
throw
into
the
sea
the
sailor
spares
her
life
and
takes
her
to
greece
the
story
as
it
stands
is
a
common
ballad
motive
and
not
calculated
to
disturb
any
one
but
the
disciple
of
the
sophists
did
not
leave
these
romances
where
he
found
them
he
liked
to
think
them
out
in
terms
of
real
life
the
songs
in
which
aëropê
poured
out
her
love
were
remembered
against
euripides
after
his
death
it
was
all
very
well
to
sympathize
in
a
remote
artistic
way
with
these
erring
damsels
but
euripides
seemed
to
come
too
near
raising
an
actual
doubt
whether
the
damsel
had
done
anything
so
very
wrong
at
all
that
respectable
people
should
want
to
murder
her
euripides
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
loose
but
highly
austere
in
his
moral
tone
but
next
to
religion
itself
the
sphere
of
sexual
conduct
has
always
been
the
great
field
for
irrational
taboos
and
savage
punishments
and
the
sophists
naturally
marked
it
as
a
the
kings
of
egypt
commonly
married
their
sisters
and
did
so
on
religious
grounds
to
a
greek
such
marriage
was
an
unspeakable
sin
there
is
a
problem
here
and
euripides
raised
it
sharply
in
a
play
based
on
the
old
of
the
king
of
the
winds
who
dwells
as
a
patriarch
on
his
floating
island
with
his
twelve
sons
married
to
his
twelve
daughters
canst
face
mine
eyes
fresh
from
thy
deed
of
shame
says
the
angry
father
in
this
play
and
his
son
answers
what
shame
when
the
doer
feels
no
shame
euripides
also
treated
several
times
legends
where
a
god
became
the
lover
of
a
mortal
maiden
and
as
we
shall
see
in
the
he
loved
to
rouse
sympathy
for
the
maiden
and
contempt
for
the
god
in
one
case
he
even
treats
through
a
mist
of
strange
religious
mysticism
the
impossible
amour
of
pasiphaë
of
crete
with
the
cretan
it
is
interesting
however
to
observe
that
there
is
in
euripides
no
trace
of
sympathy
for
the
one
form
of
perverted
indulgence
on
which
the
ancient
tone
was
markedly
different
from
ours
it
is
reserved
for
the
bestial
cyclops
and
laius
the
accursed
adventure
brilliance
invention
romance
and
scenic
effect
these
together
with
delightful
lyrics
a
wonderful
command
over
the
greek
language
and
a
somewhat
daring
admixture
of
sophistic
wisdom
which
sometimes
took
away
a
spectator
breath
were
probably
the
qualities
which
the
ordinary
public
had
felt
in
euripides
work
up
to
the
year
they
perhaps
felt
also
that
these
pleasant
gifts
were
apt
to
be
needlessly
marred
by
a
certain
unintelligible
note
of
discord
it
was
a
pity
and
as
the
man
was
now
he
ought
surely
to
have
learnt
how
to
smooth
it
out
it
was
not
smoothness
that
was
coming
chapter
iv
beginning
of
the
war
the
plays
of
maturity
medea
to
heracles
the
next
play
of
which
we
have
full
knowledge
must
have
staggered
its
audience
the
was
promptly
put
by
the
official
judges
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
of
competing
plays
and
thereafter
took
its
place
we
do
not
know
how
soon
as
one
of
the
consummate
achievements
of
the
greek
tragic
genius
its
stamp
is
fixed
on
all
the
imagination
of
antiquity
the
plot
of
the
medea
begins
where
that
of
the
of
ended
jason
had
fled
with
medea
and
her
two
children
to
corinth
which
is
ruled
by
creon
an
old
king
with
a
daughter
but
no
son
to
succeed
him
the
famous
will
just
suit
creon
as
a
if
only
he
will
dismiss
his
discreditable
barbarian
mistress
jason
has
never
been
able
to
tell
the
truth
to
medea
yet
who
could
he
secretly
accepts
creon
terms
he
marries
the
princess
and
creon
descends
on
medea
with
soldiers
to
remove
her
instantly
from
the
territory
of
corinth
medea
begs
for
one
day
in
which
to
make
ready
for
exile
for
the
children
sake
one
day
will
be
enough
by
desperate
flattery
and
pleading
she
gets
it
there
follows
a
first
scene
with
jason
in
which
man
and
woman
empty
their
hearts
on
one
another
at
least
they
try
to
but
even
yet
some
fragments
of
old
habit
and
conventional
courtesy
prevent
jason
from
telling
the
full
truth
still
it
is
a
wonderful
scene
jason
reasonable
and
cold
ready
to
recognize
all
her
claims
and
provide
her
with
everything
she
needs
except
his
own
heart
blood
medea
desolate
and
half
mad
asking
for
nothing
but
the
one
thing
he
will
not
give
love
to
her
is
the
whole
world
to
him
it
is
a
stale
memory
this
scene
ends
in
defiance
but
there
is
another
in
which
medea
feigns
repentance
and
submission
and
sends
jason
with
the
two
children
to
bear
a
costly
gift
to
the
new
bride
it
may
she
suggests
induce
creon
to
spare
the
children
and
let
her
go
to
exile
alone
the
gift
is
really
a
robe
of
burning
poison
which
has
come
to
medea
from
her
divine
ancestor
the
sun
the
bride
dies
in
agony
together
with
her
father
who
tries
to
save
her
jason
rushes
to
save
his
two
children
from
the
vengeance
which
is
sure
to
come
upon
them
from
the
kinsmen
of
the
murdered
bride
but
medea
has
already
slain
them
with
her
own
hand
and
stands
laughing
at
him
over
their
bodies
she
too
suffers
but
she
loves
the
pain
since
it
means
that
he
shall
have
happiness
no
more
the
daughter
of
the
sun
sails
away
on
her
and
an
ecstasy
of
hate
seems
to
blind
the
sky
the
shows
a
new
mastery
of
tragic
technique
especially
in
the
extraordinary
value
it
gets
out
of
the
chorus
but
as
illustrating
the
life
of
euripides
there
are
one
or
two
special
points
in
it
that
claim
notice
in
the
first
place
it
states
the
cause
of
a
barbarian
woman
against
a
greek
man
who
has
wronged
her
civilized
men
have
loved
and
deserted
savage
women
since
the
world
began
and
i
doubt
if
ever
the
deserted
one
has
found
such
words
of
fire
as
medea
speaks
the
marvel
is
that
in
such
passion
there
is
room
for
satire
but
there
is
and
even
a
reader
can
scarcely
withhold
a
bitter
laugh
when
jason
explains
the
advantage
he
has
conferred
on
medea
by
bringing
her
to
a
civilized
country
but
medea
is
not
only
a
barbarian
she
is
also
a
woman
and
fights
the
horrible
war
that
lies
an
eternally
latent
possibility
between
woman
and
man
some
of
the
most
profound
and
wounding
things
said
both
by
medea
and
by
jason
might
almost
be
labelled
in
a
book
of
extracts
any
wife
to
any
husband
or
any
husband
to
any
wife
and
medea
is
also
a
witch
she
is
also
at
heart
a
maniac
it
is
the
madness
produced
by
love
rejected
and
justice
denied
by
the
sense
of
helpless
intolerable
wrong
a
lesser
poet
might
easily
have
made
medea
a
sympathetic
character
and
have
pretended
that
long
oppression
makes
angels
of
the
oppressed
in
the
great
chorus
which
hymns
the
rise
of
woman
to
be
a
power
in
the
world
it
would
have
been
easy
to
make
the
woman
day
a
day
of
peace
and
blessing
but
euripides
tragic
to
the
heart
and
no
dealer
in
pleasant
saw
things
otherwise
when
these
oppressed
women
strike
back
he
seems
to
say
when
these
despised
and
enslaved
barbarians
can
endure
no
longer
it
will
not
be
justice
that
comes
but
the
revenge
of
madmen
this
kind
of
theme
was
not
in
itself
likely
to
please
an
audience
but
what
always
galls
the
average
most
in
a
new
work
of
genius
is
not
the
subject
but
the
treatment
euripides
treatment
of
his
subject
was
calculated
to
irritate
the
plain
man
in
two
ways
first
it
was
enigmatic
he
did
not
label
half
his
characters
bad
and
half
good
he
let
both
sides
state
their
case
and
seemed
to
enjoy
leaving
the
hearer
bewildered
and
further
he
made
a
point
of
studying
closely
and
sympathetically
many
regions
of
thought
and
character
which
the
plain
man
preferred
not
to
think
of
at
all
when
jason
had
to
defend
an
obviously
shabby
case
no
gentleman
cared
to
hear
him
but
euripides
insisted
on
his
speaking
he
enjoyed
tracking
out
the
lines
of
thought
and
feeling
which
really
actuate
men
even
fine
men
like
jason
in
jason
position
when
medea
was
revealed
as
obviously
a
wicked
woman
the
plain
man
thought
that
such
women
should
simply
be
thrashed
not
listened
to
but
euripides
loved
to
trace
all
her
complicated
sense
of
injustice
to
its
origins
and
was
determined
to
understand
and
to
explain
rather
than
to
condemn
the
plain
man
had
a
kind
of
justification
for
saying
that
euripides
actually
seemed
to
like
these
traitors
and
wicked
women
for
such
thorough
understanding
as
this
involves
always
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
this
charge
could
with
even
more
reason
be
brought
against
another
masterpiece
of
drama
which
followed
three
years
after
the
medea
the
did
indeed
win
the
first
prize
from
the
official
judges
besides
establishing
itself
in
the
admiration
of
after
ages
and
inspiring
seneca
and
racine
to
their
finest
work
but
it
profoundly
shocked
public
opinion
at
the
same
time
the
plot
is
a
variant
of
a
very
old
theme
found
in
ancient
egypt
and
in
the
pentateuch
theseus
not
here
the
ideal
democrat
on
the
athenian
throne
but
the
stormy
and
adventurous
hero
of
the
poets
had
early
in
life
conquered
the
amazons
and
ravished
their
virgin
queen
she
died
leaving
a
son
like
herself
hippolytus
theseus
some
twenty
years
after
married
phaedra
the
young
daughter
of
minos
king
of
crete
and
she
by
the
evil
will
of
aphrodite
fell
in
love
with
hippolytus
she
told
no
one
her
love
and
was
trying
to
starve
herself
to
death
when
her
old
nurse
contrived
to
worm
the
secret
from
her
and
treacherously
under
an
oath
of
secrecy
told
it
to
hippolytus
phaedra
furious
with
the
nurse
and
with
hippolytus
in
a
blind
rage
of
writes
a
false
accusation
against
hippolytus
and
hangs
herself
hippolytus
charged
by
theseus
with
the
crime
will
not
break
his
oath
and
goes
out
to
exile
under
his
father
curse
the
gods
in
fulfilment
of
the
curse
send
death
to
him
but
before
he
actually
dies
reveal
his
innocence
the
story
which
might
so
easily
be
made
ugly
or
sensual
is
treated
by
euripides
with
a
delicate
and
austere
purity
in
construction
too
and
general
beauty
of
workmanship
though
not
in
greatness
of
idea
or
depth
of
passion
the
is
perhaps
the
finest
of
all
his
plays
and
has
still
a
great
appeal
on
the
stage
but
the
philistine
was
vaguely
hurt
and
angered
by
the
treatment
so
tender
and
yet
so
inexorable
accorded
to
a
guilty
love
and
doubtless
the
more
conventional
athenian
ladies
shocked
themselves
over
the
bare
idea
of
such
a
heroine
being
mentioned
it
gives
us
some
measure
of
the
stupidity
of
public
criticism
at
the
time
that
we
find
special
attacks
made
upon
one
phrase
of
hippolytus
in
his
first
rage
with
the
nurse
he
vows
he
will
tell
theseus
of
her
proposal
she
reminds
him
of
his
oath
and
he
cries
was
but
my
tongue
was
not
my
heart
that
swore
it
is
a
passing
flash
of
indignation
at
the
trap
in
which
he
has
been
caught
when
the
time
comes
he
keeps
his
oath
at
the
cost
of
his
life
yet
the
line
is
repeatedly
cited
as
showing
the
dreadful
doctrines
of
euripides
and
the
sophists
doctrines
that
would
justify
any
perjury
the
as
we
have
it
is
a
rewritten
play
in
his
first
version
euripides
had
a
scene
in
which
phaedra
actually
declared
her
love
this
more
obvious
treatment
was
preferred
by
seneca
and
racine
but
euripides
in
his
second
thoughts
reached
a
far
more
austere
and
beautiful
effect
his
phaedra
goes
to
her
death
without
having
spoken
one
word
to
hippolytus
she
has
heard
him
but
has
not
answered
the
has
more
serene
beauty
than
any
of
euripides
plays
since
the
and
is
specially
remarkable
as
the
first
great
drama
on
the
subject
of
tragic
or
unhappy
love
a
theme
which
has
been
so
extraordinarily
fruitful
on
the
modern
stage
to
contemporaries
it
was
also
interesting
as
one
of
the
earliest
treatments
of
a
purely
local
attic
story
which
had
not
quite
found
its
way
into
the
great
sagas
of
epic
tradition
the
note
of
the
was
struck
again
some
two
years
later
in
a
play
almost
equally
powerful
and
more
horrible
the
the
heroine
is
the
famous
queen
of
troy
a
barbarian
woman
like
medea
majestic
and
beautiful
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
afterwards
transformed
by
intolerable
wrongs
into
a
kind
of
devil
her
evils
are
partly
the
ordinary
evils
that
come
to
the
conquered
in
war
but
they
are
made
worse
by
the
callousness
of
her
greek
conquerors
the
play
strikes
many
notes
of
special
bitterness
for
instance
the
one
champion
whom
hecuba
finds
among
her
conquerors
is
the
general
agamemnon
he
pleads
her
cause
in
the
camp
because
god
help
him
he
has
taken
her
daughter
cassandra
the
mad
prophetess
vowed
to
eternal
virginity
to
be
his
concubine
and
consequently
feels
there
is
another
note
remarkable
in
an
athenian
the
mob
of
the
greek
army
in
a
frenzy
of
superstition
clamour
to
have
a
trojan
princess
sacrificed
at
achilles
tomb
in
the
debate
on
this
subject
we
are
told
that
several
princes
spoke
among
them
the
two
sons
of
theseus
the
legendary
kings
of
athens
they
would
surely
as
enlightened
athenians
prevent
such
atrocities
on
the
contrary
all
we
hear
is
that
they
spoke
against
one
another
but
both
were
for
the
murder
at
the
end
of
the
as
at
the
end
of
the
we
are
wrought
to
a
pitch
of
excitement
at
which
incredible
legends
begin
to
seem
possible
history
related
that
the
queen
of
troy
maddened
by
her
wrongs
had
been
transformed
into
a
kind
of
with
fiery
eyes
whom
sailors
saw
at
night
prowling
round
the
hill
where
she
was
stoned
in
her
bloody
revenge
on
the
only
enemy
she
can
trap
into
her
power
she
seems
already
to
have
become
this
sort
of
being
in
her
heart
and
when
her
blind
and
dying
victim
prophesies
the
coming
transformation
it
seems
natural
one
only
feels
that
perhaps
the
old
miraculous
stories
are
true
after
all
the
one
light
that
shines
through
the
dark
fury
of
the
is
the
lovely
and
gentle
courage
almost
the
joy
with
which
the
virgin
martyr
polyxena
goes
to
her
death
i
have
taken
the
slightly
before
its
due
date
because
of
its
return
with
increased
bitterness
to
the
tone
and
subject
of
the
we
will
now
go
back
there
had
been
in
the
interim
a
change
in
the
poet
mind
or
at
the
least
a
strong
clash
of
conflicting
emotions
the
was
produced
in
the
first
year
of
the
peloponnesian
war
this
war
between
the
athenian
empire
representing
the
democratic
and
progressive
forces
of
greece
and
the
peloponnesian
confederacy
with
sparta
at
its
head
lasted
with
one
interruption
for
years
and
ended
in
the
capture
of
athens
and
the
destruction
of
her
power
when
war
was
first
declared
it
represented
the
policy
of
pericles
the
great
statesman
of
the
enlightenment
the
friend
of
anaxagoras
and
of
those
whom
euripides
honoured
most
it
seemed
at
first
like
a
final
struggle
between
the
forces
of
progress
and
those
of
resolute
darkness
pericles
in
a
famous
speech
which
is
recorded
for
us
by
thucydides
had
explained
to
his
adherents
the
great
causes
for
which
athens
stood
had
proclaimed
her
as
the
princess
of
cities
for
whom
it
was
a
privilege
to
die
and
urged
them
using
a
word
more
vivid
in
greek
than
it
is
in
english
to
stand
about
her
like
a
band
of
lovers
round
an
immortal
mistress
euripides
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
still
going
through
his
military
service
and
must
have
seen
much
hard
fighting
in
these
first
years
of
the
war
he
responded
to
pericles
call
by
a
burst
of
patriotic
plays
even
in
the
there
is
one
chorus
a
little
out
of
place
perhaps
but
famous
in
after
days
describing
the
glories
of
athens
they
are
not
at
all
the
conventional
glories
attributed
by
all
patriots
to
their
respective
countries
it
is
an
old
and
happy
land
which
no
conqueror
has
ever
subdued
its
children
walk
delicately
through
air
that
shines
with
sunlight
and
wisdom
is
the
very
bread
that
they
eat
the
word
is
sophia
embracing
wisdom
knowledge
art
culture
there
is
no
one
word
for
it
in
english
and
the
names
for
the
various
parts
of
it
have
lost
their
poetry
a
river
he
continues
flows
through
the
land
and
legend
tells
that
cypris
the
goddess
of
love
has
sailed
upon
it
and
dipped
her
hand
in
the
water
and
now
when
the
at
evening
blows
it
comes
laden
with
a
spirit
of
longing
but
it
is
not
ordinary
love
it
is
a
passion
and
a
great
desire
for
all
kinds
of
godlike
endeavour
a
love
that
sits
with
wisdom
upon
her
throne
a
pity
the
man
should
be
so
priggish
we
may
imagine
the
comment
of
the
average
athenian
paterfamilias
towards
the
beginning
of
the
war
we
may
safely
date
the
of
a
mutilated
but
beautiful
piece
which
rings
with
this
particular
spirit
of
patriotism
cf
above
heracles
is
dead
his
children
and
mother
are
persecuted
and
threatened
with
death
by
his
enemy
eurystheus
king
of
argos
under
the
guidance
of
their
old
comrade
iolaus
they
have
fled
from
argos
and
tried
in
vain
to
find
protectors
in
every
part
of
greece
no
city
dares
protect
them
against
the
power
of
argos
at
the
opening
of
the
play
we
find
the
children
and
iolaus
clinging
as
suppliants
to
an
altar
in
athens
the
herald
of
argos
breaks
in
upon
them
flings
down
the
old
man
and
prepares
to
drag
the
children
off
what
hope
can
iolaus
possibly
cherish
iolaus
trusts
in
two
things
in
zeus
who
will
protect
the
innocent
and
in
athens
which
is
a
free
city
and
not
afraid
the
king
of
athens
a
son
of
theseus
appears
and
rebukes
the
herald
the
argument
is
clear
these
children
are
argive
subjects
and
are
no
business
of
yours
further
they
are
utterly
helpless
and
will
be
no
possible
good
to
you
as
allies
and
if
you
do
not
give
them
up
peacefully
argos
declares
instant
war
the
king
wishes
for
peace
with
all
men
but
he
will
not
offend
god
nor
betray
the
innocent
also
he
rules
a
free
city
and
will
take
no
orders
from
any
outside
power
as
to
the
fate
of
these
children
not
being
his
business
it
is
always
the
business
of
athens
to
save
the
oppressed
one
remembers
the
old
claim
emphatically
approved
by
the
historian
of
the
persian
wars
that
athens
was
the
saviour
of
hellas
one
remembers
also
the
ultimatum
of
the
peloponnesian
confederacy
which
pericles
rejected
on
the
eve
of
the
present
war
and
the
repeated
complaints
of
the
corinthians
that
athens
will
neither
rest
herself
nor
let
others
rest
these
supply
the
clue
to
a
large
part
of
the
patriotism
of
the
of
there
is
another
element
also
and
perhaps
one
that
will
better
stand
the
test
of
impartial
criticism
in
euripides
ideal
of
athens
she
will
be
true
to
hellas
and
all
that
hellas
stands
for
for
law
for
the
gods
of
mercy
for
the
belief
in
right
rather
than
force
also
as
the
king
of
athens
is
careful
to
observe
for
democracy
and
constitutional
government
he
is
no
despot
ruling
barbarians
the
same
motives
recur
with
greater
fulness
and
thoughtfulness
in
another
play
of
the
early
war
time
the
exact
year
is
not
certain
the
scholars
reading
the
play
now
in
cool
blood
with
the
issues
at
stake
forgotten
are
inclined
to
smile
at
a
sort
of
pedantry
in
the
poet
enthusiasm
it
reminds
one
of
the
punctiliousness
with
which
shelley
sometimes
gives
one
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
according
to
godwin
this
play
opens
like
the
last
with
a
scene
of
supplication
a
band
of
women
argive
mothers
they
are
this
time
whose
sons
have
been
slain
in
war
against
thebes
have
come
to
athens
as
suppliants
they
are
led
by
adrastus
the
great
and
conquered
lord
of
argos
and
finding
aethra
the
king
mother
at
her
prayers
beside
the
altar
have
surrounded
her
with
a
chain
of
suppliant
branches
which
she
dares
not
break
they
only
ask
that
theseus
her
son
shall
get
back
for
them
the
bodies
of
their
dead
sons
whom
the
thebans
contrary
to
all
hellenic
law
have
flung
out
unburied
for
dogs
to
tear
theseus
at
first
refuses
on
grounds
of
policy
and
the
women
take
up
their
branches
and
begin
to
go
when
aethra
who
has
been
weeping
silently
breaks
out
is
this
kind
of
wrong
to
be
allowed
to
exist
thou
shalt
not
suffer
it
thou
being
my
child
thou
hast
seen
men
scorn
thy
city
call
her
wild
of

mad
thou
hast
seen
the
fire
of
morn
flash
from
her
eyes
in
answer
to
their
scorn
come
toil
on

is
this
that
makes
her
grand

ff
theseus
accepts
his
mother
charge
it
has
been
his
old
habit
to
strike
wherever
he
saw
oppression
without
counting
the
risk
and
it
shall
never
be
said
of
him
that
an
ancient
law
of
god
was
set
at
naught
when
he
and
athens
had
power
to
enforce
it
it
is
athens
as
the
saviour
of
hellas
that
we
have
here
it
is
athens
the
champion
of
hellenism
and
true
piety
but
it
is
also
the
athens
of
free
thought
and
the
enlightenment
for
later
on
when
the
dead
bodies
are
recovered
from
the
they
are
a
ghastly
sight
the
old
unreflecting
greece
would
in
the
first
place
have
thought
them
a
pollution
a
thing
which
only
slaves
must
be
sent
to
handle
in
the
second
place
since
the
mothers
were
making
lamentation
the
bodies
must
be
brought
to
their
eyes
so
as
to
improve
the
lamentation
but
theseus
feels
differently
on
both
points
why
should
the
mothers
grief
be
made
more
bitter
let
the
bodies
be
burned
in
peace
and
the
decent
ashes
given
to
the
mothers
and
as
to
the
defilement
the
king
himself
we
hear
has
taken
up
the
disfigured
bodies
in
his
arms
and
washed
their
wounds
and
shown
them
love
no
slave
touched
them
how
dreadful
was
he
not
ashamed
asks
a
bystander
the
greek
word
means
something
between
ashamed
and
disgusted
no
is
the
answer
why
should
men
be
repelled
by
one
another
sufferings
it
is
a
answer
with
great
consequences
it
is
the
antique
counterpart
of
francis
kissing
the
leper
sores
the
man
of
the
herd
is
revolted
by
the
sight
of
great
misery
and
inclines
to
despise
and
even
hate
the
sufferer
the
man
of
the
enlightenment
sees
deeper
and
the
feeling
of
revulsion
passes
away
in
the
wish
to
help
we
spoke
of
a
slight
pedantry
in
the
enthusiasms
of
the
it
is
illustrated
even
by
points
like
this
and
by
a
tendency
in
theseus
to
lecture
on
good
manners
and
the
athenian
constitution
the
rude
theban
herald
enters
asking
who
is
monarch
of
this
land
using
the
word
tyrannos
for
monarch
theseus
corrects
him
at
once
there
is
no
here
this
is
a
free
city
and
when
i
say
a
free
city
i
mean
one
in
which
the
whole
people
by
turns
takes
part
in
the
sovereignty
and
the
rich
have
no
privilege
as
against
the
poor
these
dissertations
on
democratic
government
could
stir
passions
and
force
their
way
into
scenes
of
high
poetry
legitimately
enough
at
a
time
when
men
were
fighting
and
dying
for
their
democracy
to
those
who
are
not
lovers
of
the
beautiful
city
they
will
seem
cold
and
irrelevant
other
plays
of
this
period
show
marks
of
the
same
great
wave
of
love
for
athens
the
lost
plays
all
on
attic
subjects
can
be
dated
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
the
is
built
on
an
old
legend
of
the
acropolis
and
a
poetic
love
of
athens
shines
through
the
story
the
especially
is
a
curious
document
the
meaning
of
which
is
discussed
later
on
but
the
two
plays
we
have
described
at
length
children
of
and
the
give
the
best
idea
of
what
patriotism
meant
to
our
poet
with
most
men
patriotism
is
a
matter
of
association
and
custom
they
stick
to
their
country
because
it
is
theirs
to
their
own
habits
and
prejudices
and
even
neighbours
for
the
same
reason
but
with
euripides
his
ideals
came
before
his
actual
surroundings
he
loved
athens
because
athens
meant
certain
things
and
if
the
real
athens
should
cease
to
mean
those
things
he
would
cast
her
out
of
his
heart
at
least
he
would
try
to
do
so
in
point
of
fact
that
is
always
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
but
if
ever
athens
should
be
false
it
was
pretty
certain
that
euripides
would
find
hatred
mingling
with
his
betrayed
love
there
were
signs
of
this
even
in
the
and
the
but
before
dealing
with
that
subject
we
must
dwell
for
a
few
moments
upon
another
fine
play
which
marks
in
more
than
one
sense
the
end
of
a
period
the
written
about
the
year
shows
theseus
in
the
same
rôle
of
athenian
hero
in
the
he
had
helped
adrastus
and
the
argive
mothers
and
shown
them
the
path
of
true
hellenism
in
the
he
comes
to
the
rescue
of
heracles
in
his
fall
that
hero
has
been
mad
and
slain
his
own
children
he
has
recovered
and
awakes
to
find
himself
bound
to
a
pillar
with
dead
bodies
that
he
can
not
recognize
round
about
him
he
rages
to
be
set
free
he
compels
those
who
know
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
frantic
with
shame
and
horror
he
wishes
to
curse
god
and
die
when
he
sees
theseus
approaching
theseus
has
been
his
friend
in
many
hard
days
and
heracles
dares
not
face
him
nor
speak
to
him
the
touch
of
one
so
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
sight
of
his
face
would
bring
pollution
he
shrouds
himself
in
his
mantle
and
silently
waves
theseus
away
in
a
moment
his
friend
arms
are
round
him
and
the
shrouding
mantle
is
drawn
off
there
is
no
such
thing
as
pollution
no
deed
of
man
can
stain
the
immortal
sunlight
and
a
friend
love
does
not
fear
the
infection
of
blood
heracles
is
touched
he
thanks
theseus
and
is
now
ready
to
die
god
has
tempted
him
too
far
and
he
will
defy
god
theseus
reminds
him
of
what
he
is
the
helper
of
man
the
powerful
friend
of
the
oppressed
the
heracles
who
dared
all
and
endured
all
and
now
like
a
common
man
he
speaks
of
suicide
hellas
will
not
suffer
you
to
die
in
your
blindness
the
great
adventurer
is
softened
and
won
over
by
the
wisdom
of
theseus
and
goes
to
athens
to
fulfil
in
spite
of
suffering
whatever
further
tasks
life
may
have
in
store
for
him
this
condemnation
of
suicide
was
unusual
in
antiquity
and
the
also
contains
one
remarkable
denial
of
the
current
myths
the
more
remarkable
because
as
verrall
has
pointed
out
it
seems
almost
to
upset
the
plot
of
the
play
heracles
madness
is
sent
upon
him
by
the
malignity
of
hera
we
see
her
supernatural
emissary
entering
the
room
where
heracles
lies
and
the
hero
himself
speaks
of
his
supernatural
adventures
yet
he
also
utters
the
lines
say
not
there
be
adulterers
in
heaven
nor
prisoner
gods
and
gaoler
long
ago
my
heart
has
known
it
false
and
will
not
alter
god
if
he
be
god
lacketh
naught
all
these
are
dead
unhappy
tales
of
minstrelsy
cf
fr
but
in
another
way
too
the
marks
an
epoch
in
the
life
it
seems
to
have
been
written
in
or
about
the
year
and
it
was
in
that
euripides
had
reached
the
age
of
sixty
and
was
set
free
from
military
service
he
had
had
forty
years
of
it
steady
work
for
the
most
part
fighting
against
boeotians
spartans
corinthians
against
thracian
barbarians
in
all
probability
also
against
other
people
further
overseas
we
have
no
record
of
the
campaigns
in
which
euripides
served
but
we
have
by
chance
an
inscription
of
the
year
when
he
was
giving
the
names
of
the
members
of
one
particular
tribe
the
sons
of
erechtheus
who
fell
in
war
in
that
one
year
they
had
fallen
in
cyprus
in
egypt
in
phoenicia
at
halieis
in
aegina
and
at
megara
there
were
ten
such
tribes
in
athens
and
this
record
gives
some
notion
of
the
extraordinary
energy
and
ubiquity
of
the
athenian
armies
it
is
strange
to
reflect
on
the
gulf
that
lies
between
the
life
of
an
ancient
poet
and
his
modern
descendants
our
poets
and
men
of
letters
mostly
live
either
by
writing
or
by
investments
eked
out
by
writing
they
are
professional
writers
and
readers
and
as
a
rule
nothing
else
it
is
comparatively
rare
for
any
one
of
them
to
face
daily
dangers
to
stand
against
men
who
mean
to
kill
him
and
beside
men
for
whom
he
is
ready
to
die
to
be
kept
a
couple
of
days
fasting
or
even
to
work
in
the
sweat
of
his
body
for
the
food
he
eats
if
such
things
happen
by
accident
to
one
of
us
we
cherish
them
as
priceless
copy
or
we
even
go
out
of
our
way
to
compass
the
experience
artificially
but
an
ancient
poet
was
living
hard
working
thinking
fighting
suffering
through
most
of
the
years
that
we
are
writing
about
life
he
took
part
in
the
political
assembly
in
the
council
in
the
he
worked
at
his
own
farm
or
business
and
every
year
he
was
liable
to
be
sent
on
long
military
expeditions
abroad
or
to
be
summoned
at
a
notice
to
defend
the
frontier
at
home
it
is
out
of
a
life
like
this
a
life
of
crowded
reality
and
work
that
aeschylus
and
sophocles
and
euripides
found
leisure
to
write
their
tragedies
one
writing
one
and
the
third
euripides
was
considered
in
antiquity
a
bookish
poet
he
had
a
library
in
numbers
probably
not
one
book
for
every
hundred
that
tennyson
or
george
meredith
had
he
was
a
philosopher
he
read
to
himself
but
on
what
a
background
of
personal
experience
his
philosophy
was
builded
it
is
probably
this
immersion
in
the
hard
realities
of
life
that
gives
ancient
greek
literature
some
of
its
special
characteristics
its
firm
hold
on
sanity
and
common
sense
for
instance
its
avoidance
of
sentimentality
and
paradox
and
various
seductive
kinds
of
folly
perhaps
also
its
steady
devotion
to
ideal
forms
and
high
conventions
and
its
aversion
from
anything
that
we
should
call
realism
a
man
everlastingly
wrapped
round
in
good
books
and
safe
living
cries
out
for
something
harsh
and
real
for
blood
and
and
crude
jagged
sentences
a
man
who
escapes
with
eagerness
from
a
life
of
war
and
dirt
and
brutality
and
hardship
to
dwell
just
a
short
time
among
the
muses
naturally
likes
the
muses
to
be
their
very
selves
and
not
remind
him
of
the
mud
he
has
just
washed
off
euripides
has
two
long
descriptions
of
a
battle
one
in
the
of
and
one
in
the
both
are
rhetorical
speeches
conventionally
and
without
one
touch
that
suggests
personal
experience
it
is
curious
to
compare
these
the
writings
of
the
poet
who
had
fought
in
scores
of
battles
with
the
far
more
vivid
rhapsodies
of
modern
writers
who
have
never
so
much
as
seen
a
man
pointing
a
gun
at
them
aeschylus
indeed
has
written
one
splendid
battle
piece
in
the
but
even
there
there
is
no
realism
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
war
of
liberation
that
thrills
in
us
as
we
read
it
is
not
the
particular
incidents
of
the
battle
forty
years
of
military
service
finished
as
the
men
of
sixty
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
they
must
have
had
a
feeling
of
mixed
relief
and
misgiving
they
are
now
officially
gerontes
old
men
they
are
off
hard
work
and
to
be
at
the
end
of
hard
work
is
perilously
near
being
at
the
end
of
life
there
is
in
the
a
wistful
chorus
put
in
the
mouths
of
certain
theban
elders
ff
youth
is
what
i
love
for
ever
old
age
is
a
burden
upon
the
head
a
dimness
of
light
in
the
eyes
heavier
than
the
crags
of
etna
fame
and
the
crown
of
the
east
and
chambers
piled
with
gold
what
are
they
all
compared
with
youth
a
second
life
is
what
one
longs
for
to
have
it
all
again
and
live
it
fully
if
a
man
has
any
in
him
any
real
life
left
in
his
heart
that
is
what
ought
to
be
possible
for
euripides
himself
it
seems
there
is
still
a
life
to
be
lived
the
words
are
important
and
almost
untranslatable
i
will
never
cease
mingling
together
the
graces
and
the
muses
such
words
are
nearly
nonsense
like
most
literal
translations
the
graces
or
charities
are
the
spirits
of
fulfilled
desire
the
muses
are
all
the
spirits
of
music
or
of
wisdom
of
history
and
mathematics
by
the
way
just
as
much
as
singing
and
poetry
i
will
not
rest
i
will
make
the
spirits
of
fulfilled
desire
one
with
the
spirits
of
music
a
marriage
of
blessedness
i
care
not
to
live
if
the
muses
leave
me
their
garlands
shall
be
about
me
for
ever
even
yet
the
minstrel
can
turn
memory
into
song
memory
according
to
greek
legend
was
the
mother
of
the
muses
and
the
memory
of
which
euripides
is
thinking
is
that
of
the
race
the
saga
of
history
and
tradition
more
than
his
own
the
muses
taught
him
long
ago
their
mystic
dance
and
he
will
be
theirs
for
ever
he
will
never
from
weariness
or
faint
heart
ask
them
to
rest
he
was
thinking
doubtless
of
the
lines
of
the
old
poet
alcman
to
his
dancing
maidens
lines
almost
the
most
beautiful
ever
sung
by
greek
lips
no
more
ye
maidens
voices
of
longing
my
limbs
will
bear
me
no
more
would
god
i
were
a
over
the
flower
of
the
wave
with
the
halcyons
flying
and
never
a
care
in
his
heart
the
bird
of
the
spring
euripides
asks
for
no
rest
cares
and
all
he
accepts
the
service
of
the
muses
and
prays
that
he
may
bear
their
harness
to
the
end
it
was
a
bold
prayer
and
the
muses
in
granting
it
granted
it
at
a
heavy
price
chapter
v
life
continued
the
embittering
of
the
war
alcibiades
and
the
demagogues
the
ion
the
trojan
women
our
greek
historians
with
thucydides
at
their
head
are
practically
unanimous
in
associating
with
the
peloponnesian
war
a
progressive
degradation
and
embitterment
in
greek
public
life
and
a
reaction
against
the
old
dreams
and
ideals
we
can
measure
the
change
by
many
slight
but
significant
utterances
when
herodotus
records
his
opinion
that
in
the
persian
wars
the
athenians
had
been
the
saviours
of
hellas
he
has
to
preface
the
remark
by
a
curious
apology
vii
here
i
am
compelled
by
necessity
to
express
an
opinion
which
will
be
offensive
to
most
of
mankind
but
i
can
not
refrain
from
putting
it
in
the
way
which
i
believe
to
be
true
he
was
writing
at
the
beginning
of
the
peloponnesian
war
and
by
that
time
athens
was
not
the
saviour
but
the
tyrant
city
her
allies
had
from
time
to
time
refused
to
serve
or
tried
to
secede
from
the
alliance
and
one
by
one
she
had
reduced
them
to
compulsory
subjection
the
league
had
become
confessedly
an
empire
even
pericles
the
great
statesman
of
the
good
time
who
had
sought
and
achieved
so
many
fine
ends
had
failed
to
build
up
a
free
league
based
on
a
representative
elected
body
the
possibility
of
such
a
plan
had
hardly
yet
been
conceived
in
the
world
though
a
rudimentary
system
of
international
councils
did
in
some
places
exist
between
neighbouring
villages
and
pericles
must
not
be
personally
blamed
for
an
error
however
fatal
which
no
one
living
knew
how
to
avoid
but
he
realized
at
last
in
what
athens
had
come
to
ii
do
not
imagine
you
are
fighting
about
a
simple
issue
the
subjection
or
independence
of
certain
cities
you
have
an
empire
to
lose
and
a
danger
to
face
from
those
who
hate
you
for
your
empire
to
resign
it
now
would
be
impossible
if
at
this
crisis
some
timid
and
inactive
spirits
are
hankering
after
righteousness
even
at
that
price
for
by
this
time
your
empire
has
become
a
despotism
tyrannis
a
thing
which
it
is
considered
unjust
to
acquire
but
which
can
never
be
safely
surrendered
the
same
thought
is
emphasized
more
brutally
by
cleon
iii
i
have
remarked
again
and
again
that
a
democracy
can
not
govern
an
empire
and
never
more
clearly
than
now
you
do
not
realize
that
when
you
make
a
concession
to
the
allies
out
of
pity
or
are
led
away
by
their
specious
pleading
you
commit
a
weakness
dangerous
to
yourselves
without
receiving
any
gratitude
from
them
remember
that
your
empire
is
a
despotism
exercised
over
unwilling
men
who
are
always
in
conspiracy
against
you
do
not
be
misled
he
adds
a
little
later
by
the
three
most
deadly
enemies
of
empire
pity
and
charm
of
words
and
the
generosity
of
strength
iii
so
much
for
the
ideals
of
chivalry
and
freedom
and
sophia
for
i
think
the
second
of
cleon
enemies
refers
especially
to
the
eloquent
wisdom
of
the
philosophers
and
as
for
democracy
we
do
not
hear
now
that
the
very
name
of
it
is
beautiful
we
hear
that
it
is
no
principle
on
which
to
govern
an
empire
and
later
on
we
shall
hear
alcibiades
an
athenian
of
democratic
antecedents
saying
at
sparta
of
course
all
sensible
men
know
what
democracy
is
and
i
better
than
most
from
personal
experience
but
there
is
nothing
new
to
be
said
about
acknowledged
insanity
vi
the
ideals
failed
and
if
we
are
to
believe
our
contemporary
authors
the
men
failed
too
pericles
with
all
his
errors
was
a
man
of
noble
mind
he
was
pure
in
motive
lofty
a
born
ruler
he
led
his
people
towards
beauty
and
wisdom
and
he
wished
it
to
be
written
on
his
grave
that
no
athenian
had
put
on
mourning
through
his
act
cleon
they
all
tell
us
was
a
bellowing
demagogue
violent
not
over
honest
unscrupulous
blundering
only
resolute
to
fight
for
the
demos
of
athens
till
he
dropped
and
to
keep
the
poor
from
starving
at
whatever
cost
of
blackmailing
the
rich
and
flaying
the
allied
cities
and
when
he
by
good
luck
as
thucydides
considers
was
killed
in
battle
he
was
succeeded
by
hyperbolus
a
caricature
of
himself
as
a
pun
of
the
comic
poets
puts
it
a
cleon
in
hyperbole
this
picture
has
been
subjected
to
just
criticism
in
many
details
but
it
represents
on
the
whole
the
united
voice
of
our
ancient
witnesses
one
character
only
shines
out
in
this
period
with
a
lurid
light
alcibiades
so
far
as
one
can
understand
him
at
all
from
our
fragmentary
and
anecdotal
records
must
have
been
something
like
a
lord
byron
on
a
grand
scale
turned
soldier
and
statesman
instead
of
poet
his
disastrous
end
and
his
betrayal
of
all
political
parties
have
probably
affected
his
reputation
unfairly
violent
and
unprincipled
as
he
certainly
was
the
peculiar
dissolute
caddishness
implied
in
the
anecdotes
is
probably
a
misrepresentation
of
the
kind
that
arises
so
easily
against
a
man
who
has
no
friends
it
needs
an
effort
to
imagine
what
he
looked
like
before
he
was
found
out
of
noble
birth
and
a
nephew
of
pericles
famous
for
his
good
looks
and
his
distinguished
if
insolent
manners
a
brilliant
soldier
an
ambitious
and
politician
a
pupil
of
the
philosophers
and
an
especially
intimate
friend
of
socrates
capable
both
of
rising
to
great
ideas
and
of
expounding
them
to
the
multitude
he
was
hailed
by
a
large
party
as
the
destined
saviour
of
athens
and
seems
for
a
time
at
least
to
have
made
the
same
impression
upon
euripides
even
in
the
as
it
is
euripides
congratulates
athens
on
possessing
in
theseus
a
general
good
and
young
and
critics
have
connected
the
phrase
with
the
election
of
alcibiades
at
a
very
early
age
to
be
general
in
the
year
more
significant
perhaps
is
the
curious
case
of
the
the
ancient
argument
tells
us
definitely
that
it
was
not
produced
in
athens
and
we
find
from
another
source
that
it
was
produced
by
one
democrates
or
timocrates
now
euripides
had
a
friend
called
timocrates
who
was
an
argive
so
it
looks
as
if
the
play
had
been
produced
in
argos
this
would
be
astonishing
but
by
no
means
inexplicable
it
was
an
old
athenian
policy
to
check
sparta
by
organizing
a
league
in
the
peloponnese
itself
the
nucleus
was
to
consist
in
three
states
argos
elis
and
mantinea
which
had
been
visited
by
themistocles
just
after
the
persian
wars
and
had
set
up
democracies
on
the
athenian
model
it
was
alcibiades
who
eventually
succeeded
in
organizing
this
league
in
and
it
seems
likely
that
the
was
sent
to
argos
for
production
in
much
the
same
spirit
in
which
pindar
used
to
send
his
chorus
of
dancers
with
a
new
song
to
compliment
some
foreign
king
the
play
seems
to
contain
a
reference
to
the
peloponnesian
war
it
indulges
in
curiously
direct
denunciations
of
the
spartans
ff
and
the
spartan
menelaus
is
the
villain
of
the
piece
a
more
stagey
villain
than
euripides
in
his
better
moments
would
have
permitted
we
have
also
one
doubtful
external
record
of
our
temporary
faith
in
alcibiades
in
the
year
there
fell
an
observance
of
the
olympian
festival
the
greatest
of
all
the
games
which
carried
with
it
a
religious
truce
alcibiades
succeeded
in
getting
sparta
convicted
of
a
violation
of
this
truce
and
consequently
excluded
from
the
festival
which
was
a
marked
blow
at
her
prestige
then
entering
himself
as
a
competitor
he
won
with
his
own
horses
a
whole
series
of
prizes
including
the
first
in
the
chariot
competition
and
plutarch
in
his
of
refers
to
a
victory
ode
which
was
written
for
him
on
this
occasion
as
report
goes
by
the
poet
euripides
ch
this
revival
of
the
pindaric
for
a
personal
victory
would
fit
in
with
the
known
character
of
alcibiades
and
it
would
be
a
sharp
example
of
the
irony
of
history
if
euripides
consented
to
write
the
ode
euripides
delusion
was
natural
and
it
was
the
points
towards
peace
and
the
true
policy
of
alcibiades
was
to
make
peace
impossible
and
even
apart
from
that
the
ideals
of
the
two
men
were
antipathetic
the
matter
is
summed
up
in
the
of
aristophanes
produced
in
when
the
only
question
remaining
about
alcibiades
was
whether
he
was
more
dangerous
to
the
city
as
an
honoured
leader
or
as
an
enemy
and
exile
the
two
great
poets
of
the
dead
are
asked
for
their
advice
on
this
particular
subject
and
their
answers
are
clear
aeschylus
says
submit
to
the
lion
whelp
euripides
rejects
him
with
three
scathing
lines
cf
long
before
the
date
of
the
alcibiades
had
probably
grown
to
be
in
the
mind
of
euripides
the
very
type
and
symbol
of
the
evil
times
all
greece
we
have
the
emphatic
and
disinterested
testimony
of
thucydides
for
the
statement
was
gradually
corrupted
and
embittered
by
the
long
war
probably
all
war
as
it
accustoms
people
more
and
more
to
desperate
needs
and
desperate
expedients
for
meeting
them
and
sets
more
and
more
aside
the
common
generosities
and
humanities
of
life
tends
to
some
degradation
of
character
but
this
particular
war
was
specially
harmful
for
one
thing
it
was
a
struggle
not
simply
between
two
foreign
powers
but
between
two
principles
oligarchy
and
democracy
in
almost
all
the
cities
of
the
athenian
alliance
there
were
large
numbers
of
malcontent
rich
who
were
only
too
ready
if
chance
offered
to
overthrow
the
constitution
massacre
the
mob
and
revolt
to
sparta
in
a
good
many
of
the
cities
on
the
other
side
there
were
masses
of
discontented
poor
who
had
been
touched
by
the
breath
of
democratic
doctrines
and
were
anxious
for
a
chance
to
cut
the
throats
of
the
ruling
few
it
was
like
the
state
of
things
produced
in
many
cities
of
europe
by
the
french
revolution
a
secret
civil
strife
lay
in
the
background
behind
the
open
war
and
the
open
war
itself
was
a
long
protracted
struggle
for
life
or
death
probably
the
most
man
when
engaged
in
a
fights
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
most
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
as
the
toils
of
war
closed
tighter
round
athens
and
she
began
to
feel
herself
fighting
gasp
by
gasp
for
both
her
empire
and
her
life
the
ideals
of
the
saviour
of
hellas
fell
away
from
her
she
fought
with
every
weapon
that
came
such
times
called
forth
naturally
the
men
that
suited
them
the
assembly
cared
less
to
listen
to
decent
and
thoughtful
people
not
to
speak
of
philosophers
it
was
feeling
bitter
and
fierce
and
frightened
and
it
liked
speakers
who
were
feeling
the
same
the
same
fear
that
made
it
cruel
made
it
also
superstitious
on
one
occasion
the
whole
city
went
mad
with
alarm
because
of
a
prank
played
on
some
ancient
figures
of
hermes
on
another
a
great
army
was
lost
because
it
and
its
general
were
afraid
to
move
during
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
so
soon
had
anaxagoras
been
forgotten
is
this
the
result
one
is
inclined
to
ask
of
the
great
ideals
of
democracy
and
enlightenment
of
course
the
old
tory
type
of
greek
historian
like
mitford
revelled
in
an
affirmative
answer
but
a
more
reflective
view
of
history
suggests
a
different
explanation
we
must
distinguish
carefully
between
the
two
notions
enlightenment
and
democracy
they
happen
to
have
gone
together
in
two
or
three
of
the
greatest
periods
of
human
progress
and
we
are
apt
to
regard
them
as
somehow
necessarily
allied
but
they
are
not
doubtless
democracy
is
itself
an
exalted
conception
and
belongs
naturally
to
the
ideas
of
the
enlightenment
just
as
does
the
belief
in
reason
in
the
free
pursuit
of
knowledge
in
justice
to
the
weak
the
wish
to
be
right
rather
than
to
be
victorious
or
the
hatred
of
violence
and
superstition
as
such
but
the
trouble
is
that
in
a
backward
and
untrained
people
the
victory
of
democracy
may
result
in
the
defeat
of
the
other
exalted
ideas
the
athenian
democracy
as
conceived
by
pericles
euripides
or
protagoras
was
a
free
people
highly
civilized
and
pursuing
wisdom
free
from
superstition
and
oppression
themselves
and
helping
always
to
emancipate
others
but
the
actual
rustics
and
workmen
who
voted
for
pericles
had
been
only
touched
on
the
surface
by
the
wisdom
of
the
sophists
they
liked
him
because
he
made
them
great
and
admired
and
proud
of
being
athenians
but
one
must
suspect
that
when
they
were
back
at
their
farms
and
the
spell
of
pericles
wisdom
was
removed
they
practised
again
the
silliest
and
cruellest
old
agricultural
magic
were
terrified
by
the
old
superstitions
beat
their
slaves
and
wives
and
hated
the
strangers
a
few
miles
off
just
as
their
grandfathers
had
done
in
the
old
times
what
seems
to
have
happened
at
the
end
of
the
is
that
owing
largely
to
the
democratic
enthusiasm
of
the
sophistic
movement
in
athens
the
common
people
is
strongly
in
power
owing
to
the
same
movement
its
old
taboos
and
rules
of
conduct
are
a
little
shaken
and
less
able
to
stand
against
strong
temptation
but
meantime
the
true
moral
lessons
of
the
enlightenment
the
hardest
of
all
lessons
for
man
to
learn
have
never
worked
into
their
bones
just
as
the
french
revolution
called
into
power
the
brutal
and
superstitious
peasant
who
was
the
product
of
the
old
régime
and
could
never
rise
to
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
so
the
athenian
enlightenment
had
put
into
power
the
old
unregenerate
mass
of
sentiment
that
had
not
been
permeated
by
the
enlightenment
cleon
was
no
friend
of
sophists
but
their
avowed
enemy
and
when
he
told
the
assembly
in
its
difficulties
simply
to
double
the
tribute
of
the
allies
and
sack
their
towns
if
they
did
not
pay
when
he
urged
the
killing
in
cold
blood
of
all
the
mitylenean
prisoners
he
was
preaching
doctrines
that
would
probably
have
seemed
natural
enough
in
the
old
days
before
any
sophists
had
troubled
men
minds
with
talk
about
duties
towards
dirty
foreigners
and
the
people
who
followed
his
lead
were
the
same
sort
of
people
who
would
naturally
be
terrified
about
the
mutilation
of
a
taboo
image
or
an
eclipse
of
the
divine
moon
what
they
had
perhaps
acquired
from
the
sophistic
movement
was
a
touch
of
effrontery
boeotians
or
acarnanians
might
commit
crimes
when
they
needed
to
by
instinct
without
stating
their
reasons
in
athens
you
had
at
least
to
discuss
the
principle
of
the
proposed
crime
and
accept
it
for
what
it
was
worth
a
cynic
or
a
hypocrite
trained
in
a
sophistic
school
might
offer
occasional
help
with
the
theory
perhaps
the
earliest
touch
of
euripides
bitterness
against
his
country
comes
as
we
have
seen
in
the
but
the
period
we
have
just
reached
soon
after
the
is
marked
by
one
of
the
most
ironic
and
enigmatical
plays
he
ever
wrote
the
is
interesting
in
every
line
and
contains
one
scene
which
is
sometimes
considered
the
most
poignant
in
all
greek
tragedy
yet
it
leaves
every
reader
unsatisfied
is
it
a
pious
offering
to
apollo
the
ancestor
of
the
ionian
race
if
so
why
is
apollo
the
villain
of
the
piece
is
it
a
glorification
of
ancient
athens
her
legends
and
her
shrines
if
so
why
are
the
shrines
polluted
by
lustful
gods
the
legends
made
specially
barbaric
and
the
beautiful
princess
shown
as
a
seduced
woman
and
a
murderess
nay
further
why
does
the
hero
of
the
play
explain
in
a
careful
speech
that
he
would
sooner
live
a
friendless
slave
in
the
temple
at
delphi
than
a
free
man
and
a
prince
in
such
a
place
as
athens
a
city
full
of
terror
where
men
who
are
good
and
might
show
wisdom
are
silent
and
never
come
forward
while
the
men
in
power
watch
enviously
round
to
destroy
any
possible
rival
ff
words
in
ff
in
delphi
he
has
peace
and
is
not
jostled
off
the
pavement
by
the
scum
of
the
earth
a
complaint
which
is
often
made
in
greek
literature
about
democratic
athens
i
think
the
best
way
to
understand
the
is
to
suppose
that
euripides
in
his
usual
manner
is
just
taking
an
old
canonical
legend
seeing
the
human
drama
and
romance
in
it
and
working
it
together
in
his
own
clear
ironic
mind
till
at
last
he
throws
out
his
play
saying
there
are
your
gods
and
your
holy
legends
see
how
you
like
them
the
irony
is
lurking
at
every
corner
though
of
course
the
drama
and
romance
come
first
the
is
of
all
the
extant
plays
the
most
definitely
blasphemous
against
the
traditional
gods
greek
legend
was
full
of
stories
of
heroes
born
of
the
love
of
a
god
and
a
mortal
woman
such
stories
could
be
turned
into
high
religious
mysteries
as
by
aeschylus
in
his
into
tender
and
reverent
legends
as
by
pindar
in
one
or
two
odes
euripides
uses
no
such
idealization
in
play
after
play
he
seems
to
have
scarified
such
gods
as
he
does
now
in
the
legend
told
that
ion
the
of
the
ionians
was
the
son
of
the
athenian
princess
creusa
creusa
was
married
to
one
xuthus
an
aeolian
soldier
but
the
real
father
of
ion
was
the
god
apollo
euripides
treats
the
story
as
if
apollo
were
just
a
lawless
ravisher
utterly
selfish
and
ready
to
lie
when
pressed
though
in
his
way
when
he
lost
nothing
by
it
a
sort
of
alcibiades
in
fact
xuthus
is
a
butt
a
foreigner
with
abrupt
and
violent
manners
lied
to
by
apollo
befooled
by
his
wife
disobeyed
by
her
maids
and
eventually
made
happy
by
the
belief
that
her
illegitimate
son
is
really
his
own
creusa
herself
though
drawn
with
extraordinary
sympathy
and
beauty
is
at
heart
a
savage
creusa
when
she
bore
her
child
laid
him
in
her
terror
in
the
same
cavern
where
apollo
had
ravished
her
surely
the
god
would
save
his
own
son
she
came
again
and
the
child
was
gone
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
god
had
carried
him
in
his
cradle
to
delphi
where
he
was
discovered
by
the
priestess
and
reared
as
a
foundling
in
the
temple
courts
creusa
was
then
married
to
xuthus
who
knew
nothing
of
her
adventure
some
seventeen
years
or
so
afterwards
since
the
pair
had
no
children
they
came
to
delphi
to
consult
the
god
creusa
there
meets
the
foundling
ion
and
the
two
are
strangely
attracted
to
one
another
she
almost
confides
to
him
her
story
and
he
tells
her
what
he
knows
of
his
own
meantime
xuthus
goes
in
to
ask
the
god
for
a
child
the
god
tells
him
that
the
first
person
he
meets
on
leaving
the
shrine
will
be
his
son
this
of
course
is
a
lie
he
meets
ion
salutes
him
as
his
son
and
embraces
him
wildly
the
boy
protests
do
not
cries
xuthus
fly
from
what
you
should
love
best
on
earth
i
do
not
love
teaching
manners
to
demented
foreigners
retorts
the
youth
sobered
by
this
xuthus
tries
with
ion
help
to
think
out
what
the
god
can
mean
by
saying
that
this
youth
is
his
son
his
married
life
has
always
been
correct
but
once
when
he
was
a
young
man
there
was
a
time
it
was
a
great
religious
feast
at
delphi
and
he
was
drunk
ion
accepts
the
explanation
though
he
evidently
does
not
much
like
his
new
father
he
makes
difficulties
about
going
to
athens
he
is
sorry
for
creusa
he
wishes
to
stay
as
he
is
xuthus
decides
that
creusa
must
be
deceived
he
will
say
he
has
taken
a
fancy
to
ion
and
wishes
to
adopt
him
meantime
let
them
have
a
great
and
if
any
of
the
chorus
say
a
word
to
creusa
they
shall
be
hanged
creusa
enters
accompanied
by
one
of
euripides
characteristic
old
slaves
the
man
has
tended
creusa
from
childhood
lives
for
her
and
thinks
of
nothing
else
he
is
utterly
without
scruple
apart
from
her
the
chorus
immediately
tell
creusa
what
they
know
of
the
story
ion
is
xuthus
illegitimate
son
he
must
have
known
it
all
the
time
he
has
now
with
the
god
connivance
arranged
to
take
the
son
back
to
athens
as
for
creusa
the
god
says
she
shall
have
no
child
stung
to
fury
to
think
that
her
child
is
dead
that
the
boy
whom
she
so
loved
is
deliberately
deceiving
her
and
that
apollo
is
adding
this
deliberate
insult
to
his
old
brutal
wrong
creusa
casts
away
shame
and
standing
up
in
front
of
the
great
temple
cries
out
her
reproach
against
the
god
she
is
disgraced
publicly
and
for
ever
but
at
least
she
will
drag
down
this
devil
who
sits
crowned
and
singing
to
the
lyre
while
the
women
he
has
ravished
go
mad
with
grief
and
his
babes
are
torn
by
wild
beasts
in
the
silence
that
follows
there
is
none
to

the
cry

heart
and
obvious
double
meanings
which
have
been
repeated
by
so
many
plays
since
that
we
instinctively
regard
them
as
out
of
date
it
is
redeemed
by
its
passion
and
its
sincere
psychology
on
the
other
hand
it
is
more
ironical
than
any
other
extant
greek
play
the
irony
touches
every
part
of
the
story
excepting
the
actual
tragedy
of
the
wronged
woman
and
the
charming
carelessness
of
the
foundling
life
we
should
remember
that
an
attack
on
the
god
of
delphi
was
not
particularly
objectionable
in
athens
for
that
god
by
the
mouth
of
his
official
prophets
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
assured
the
spartans
that
if
they
fought
well
they
would
conquer
and
that
he
the
god
would
be
fighting
for
them
the
best
that
a
pious
athenian
could
do
for
such
a
god
as
that
was
to
suppose
that
the
official
prophets
were
liars
still
euripides
attacks
much
more
than
delphi
if
his
thoughts
ever
strike
home
it
is
not
merely
delphi
that
will
fall
it
is
the
whole
structure
of
greek
ritual
and
mythology
it
is
against
the
gods
and
against
athens
that
his
irony
cuts
sharpest
irony
is
the
mood
of
one
who
has
some
strong
emotion
within
but
will
not
quite
trust
himself
on
the
flood
of
it
and
romance
is
largely
the
mood
of
one
turning
away
from
realities
that
disgust
him
in
the
year
euripides
in
his
relation
to
athens
was
shaken
for
the
first
time
out
of
any
thought
of
either
romance
or
irony
during
the
summer
and
winter
of
that
year
there
occurred
an
event
of
very
small
military
importance
and
no
direct
political
consequences
to
which
nevertheless
thucydides
devotes
continuous
chapters
in
a
very
significant
part
of
his
work
the
part
just
before
the
final
catastrophe
the
event
is
the
siege
and
capture
by
the
athenians
of
a
little
island
called
melos
the
massacre
of
all
its
adult
men
and
the
enslavement
of
the
women
and
children
the
island
had
no
military
power
it
had
little
commerce
and
lived
on
its
own
poor
agriculture
its
population
was
not
large
when
it
was
depopulated
five
hundred
colonists
were
enough
to
people
it
again
why
then
this
large
place
in
thucydides
brief
and
severe
narrative
only
i
think
because
of
the
moral
issue
involved
and
the
naked
clarity
of
the
crime
thucydides
tells
us
of
a
long
debate
between
the
athenian
envoys
and
the
melian
council
and
professes
to
report
the
arguments
used
on
each
side
no
doubt
there
is
conscious
artistic
composition
in
the
reports
we
can
not
conclude
that
any
athenian
envoy
used
exactly
these
horrible
words
but
we
can
be
sure
that
thucydides
took
the
war
on
melos
as
the
great
typical
example
of
the
principles
on
which
the
athenian
war
party
were
led
to
act
in
the
later
part
of
the
war
we
can
go
further
and
be
almost
sure
that
he
selected
it
as
a
type
of
sin
leading
to
punishment
that
sin
of
hubris
or
pride
which
according
to
greek
ideas
was
associated
with
some
blindness
and
pointed
straight
to
a
fall
in
cool
and
measured
language
the
athenian
envoys
explain
to
the
melian
senate
for
the
populace
is
carefully
excluded
that
it
suits
their
purpose
that
melos
should
become
subject
to
their
empire
they
will
not
pretend
being
sensible
men
and
talking
to
sensible
men
that
the
melians
have
done
them
any
wrong
or
that
they
have
any
lawful
claim
to
melos
but
they
do
not
wish
any
islands
to
remain
independent
it
is
a
bad
example
to
the
others
the
power
of
athens
is
practically
irresistible
melos
is
free
to
submit
or
to
be
destroyed
the
melians
in
language
carefully
controlled
but
vibrating
with
suppressed
bitterness
answer
as
best
they
can
is
it
quite
safe
for
athens
to
break
all
laws
of
right
empires
are
mortal
and
the
vengeance
of
mankind
upon
such
a
tyranny
as
this
we
take
the
risk
of
that
answer
the
athenians
the
immediate
question
is
whether
you
prefer
to
live
or
die
the
melians
plead
to
remain
neutral
the
plea
is
of
course
refused
at
any
rate
they
will
not
submit
they
know
athens
is
vastly
stronger
in
men
and
ships
and
military
skill
still
the
gods
may
help
the
innocent
that
risk
causes
us
no
uneasiness
say
the
envoys
we
are
quite
as
pious
as
you
the
lacedaemonians
are
bound
by
every
tie
of
honour
and
kinship
to
intervene
we
shall
of
course
see
that
they
do
not
in
any
case
we
choose
to
fight
and
hope
rather
than
to
accept
slavery
a
very
regrettable
misjudgement
say
the
athenians
and
the
war
proceeds
to
its
hideous
end
as
i
read
this
melian
dialogue
as
it
is
called
again
and
again
i
feel
more
clearly
the
note
of
deep
and
angry
satire
probably
the
athenian
would
indignantly
have
repudiated
the
reasoning
put
into
the
mouths
of
their
leaders
after
all
they
were
a
democracy
and
as
thucydides
fully
recognizes
a
great
mass
of
men
if
it
does
commit
infamies
likes
first
to
be
drugged
and
stimulated
with
lies
it
seldom
like
the
wicked
man
in
aristotle
ethics
calmly
sins
but
in
any
case
the
massacre
of
melos
produced
on
the
minds
of
men
like
thucydides
and
euripides
and
we
might
probably
add
almost
all
the
great
writers
who
were
anywise
touched
by
the
philosophic
spirit
this
peculiar
impression
it
seemed
like
a
revelation
of
naked
and
triumphant
sin
and
we
can
not
but
feel
the
intention
with
which
thucydides
continues
his
story
they
put
to
death
all
the
melians
whom
they
found
of
estate
and
made
slaves
of
the
women
and
children
and
they
sent
later
five
hundred
colonists
and
took
the
land
for
their
own
and
the
same
winter
the
athenians
sought
to
sail
with
a
greater
fleet
than
ever
before
and
conquer
sicily
this
was
the
great
sicilian
expedition
that
brought
athens
to
her
doom
euripides
must
have
been
brooding
on
the
crime
of
melos
during
the
autumn
and
winter
in
the
spring
when
the
great
fleet
was
still
getting
ready
to
sail
he
produced
a
strange
play
the
work
rather
of
a
prophet
than
a
mere
artist
which
was
reckoned
in
antiquity
as
one
of
his
masterpieces
but
which
set
a
flame
of
discord
for
ever
between
himself
and
his
people
one
would
like
to
know
what
archon
accepted
that
play
and
what
rich
man
gave
the
chorus
it
was
called
trojan
and
it
tells
of
the
proudest
conquest
wrought
by
greek
arms
in
legend
the
taking
of
troy
by
the
armies
of
agamemnon
but
it
tells
the
old
legend
in
a
peculiar
way
slowly
reflectively
with
little
stir
of
the
blood
we
are
made
to
look
at
the
great
glory
until
we
see
not
glory
at
all
but
shame
and
blindness
and
a
world
swallowed
up
in
night
at
the
very
beginning
we
see
gods
brooding
over
the
wreck
of
troy
as
they
might
be
brooding
over
that
wrecked
island
in
the
aegean
whose
walls
were
almost
as
ancient
as
troy
own
it
is
from
the
aegean
that
poseidon
has
risen
to
look
upon
the
city
that
is
now
a
smoking
ruin
sacked
by
the
greeks
the
shrines
are
empty
and
the
sanctuaries
run
red
with
blood
the
unburied
corpses
lie
polluting
the
air
and
the
conquering
soldiers
and
uneasy
they
know
not
why
roam
to
and
fro
waiting
for
a
wind
that
will
take
them
away
from
the
country
they
have
made
horrible
such
is
the
handiwork
of
athena
daughter
of
zeus
the
name
gives
one
a
moment
of
shock
athena
is
so
confessedly
the
tutelary
goddess
of
athens
but
euripides
was
only
following
the
regular
homeric
story
in
which
athena
had
been
the
great
enemy
of
troy
and
the
unscrupulous
friend
of
the
greeks
her
name
is
no
sooner
mentioned
than
she
appears
but
she
is
changed
her
favourites
have
gone
too
far
they
have
committed
hubris
insulted
the
altars
of
the
gods
and
defiled
virgins
in
holy
places
athena
herself
is
now
turned
against
her
people
their
great
fleet
flushed
with
conquest
and
stained
with
sin
is
just
about
to
set
sail
athena
has
asked
zeus
the
father
for
vengeance
against
it
and
zeus
has
given
it
into
her
hand
she
and
poseidon
swear
alliance
the
storm
shall
break
as
soon
as
the
fleet
sets
sail
and
the
hungry
rocks
of
the
aegean
be
glutted
with
wrecked
ships
and
dying
men
how
are
ye
blind
ye
treaders
down
of
cities
ye
that
cast
temples
to
desolation
and
lay
waste
tombs
the
untrodden
sanctuaries
where
lie
the
ancient
dead
yourselves
so
soon
to
die
and
the
angry
presences
vanish
into
the
night
were
the
consciences
of
the
sackers
of
melos
quite
easy
during
that
prologue
then
the
day
dawns
and
the
play
begins
and
we
see
what
in
plain
words
the
great
glory
has
amounted
to
we
see
the
shattered
walls
and
some
poor
temporary
huts
where
once
was
a
city
and
presently
we
see
a
human
figure
rising
wearily
from
sleep
it
is
an
old
woman
very
tired
her
head
and
her
back
aching
from
the
night
on
the
hard
ground
the
old
woman
is
hecuba
lately
the
queen
of
troy
and
in
the
huts
hard
by
are
other
captives
high
women
chosen
from
the
waste
of
war
to
be
slaves
to
the
greek
chieftains
they
are
to
be
allotted
this
morning
she
calls
them
and
they
come
startled
out
of
sleep
some
terrified
some
quiet
some
still
dreaming
one
suddenly
frantic
through
the
rest
of
the
play
we
hear
bit
by
bit
the
decisions
of
the
greek
cassandra
the
virgin
priestess
is
to
be
agamemnon
concubine
the
stupid
and
herald
who
brings
the
news
thinks
it
good
news
how
lucky
for
the
poor
helpless
girl
and
the
king
too
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
but
he
thinks
it
was
that
air
of
unearthly
holiness
in
cassandra
which
made
agamemnon
fancy
her
the
other
women
are
but
cassandra
is
happy
god
is
leading
her
her
flesh
seems
no
longer
to
be
part
of
her
she
has
seen
something
of
the
mind
of
god
and
knows
that
the
fate
of
troy
and
of
dead
hector
is
better
than
that
of
their
conquerors
she
sees
in
the
end
that
she
must
discrown
herself
take
off
the
bands
of
the
priestess
and
accept
her
desecration
she
sees
to
what
end
she
is
fated
to
lead
agamemnon
sees
the
vision
of
his
murdered
body
murdered
by
his
wife
cast
out
in
precipitous
places
on
a
night
of
storm
and
beside
him
on
the
wet
rocks
there
is
some
one
else
dead
outcast
naked
who
is
it
she
sees
it
is
herself
and
goes
forth
to
what
is
appointed
the
central
portion
of
the
play
deals
with
the
decision
of
the
greeks
about
hector
little
boy
astyanax
he
is
only
a
child
now
but
of
course
he
will
grow
and
he
will
form
the
natural
rallying
point
for
all
the
fugitive
trojans
and
the
remnants
of
the
great
trojan
alliance
on
the
principles
of
the
melian
dialogue
he
is
best
out
of
the
way
the
herald
is
sent
to
take
the
child
from
his
mother
andromache
and
throw
him
over
the
battlements
he
comes
when
the
two
women
andromache
and
hecuba
are
talking
together
and
the
child
playing
somewhere
near
andromache
has
been
allotted
as
slave
to
pyrrhus
the
son
of
achilles
and
is
consulting
with
hecuba
about
the
horror
she
has
to
face
shall
she
simply
resist
to
the
end
in
the
hope
that
pyrrhus
may
hate
and
kill
her
or
shall
she
try
as
she
always
has
tried
to
make
the
best
of
things
hecuba
advises
think
of
the
boy
and
think
of
your
own
gentle
nature
you
are
made
to
love
and
not
to
hate
when
things
were
happy
you
made
them
happier
when
they
are
miserable
you
will
tend
to
heal
them
and
make
them
less
sore
you
may
even
win
pyrrhus
to
be
kind
to
your
child
hector
child
and
he
may
grow
to
be
a
help
to
all
who
have
once
loved
us
as
they
speak
the
shadow
of
the
entering
herald
falls
across
them
he
can
not
speak
at
first
but
he
has
come
to
take
the
child
to
its
death
and
his
message
has
to
be
given
this
scene
with
the
parting
between
andromache
and
the
child
which
follows
seems
to
me
perhaps
the
most
absolutely
in
all
the
tragic
literature
of
the
world
after
rising
from
it
one
understands
aristotle
judgment
of
euripides
as
the
most
tragic
of
the
poets
for
sheer
beauty
of
writing
for
a
kind
of
gorgeous
dignity
that
at
times
reminds
one
of
aeschylus
and
yet
is
compatible
with
the
subtlest
clashes
of
mood
and
character
the
stands
perhaps
first
among
all
the
works
of
euripides
but
that
is
not
its
most
remarkable
quality
the
action
works
up
first
to
a
great
empty
scene
where
the
child
body
is
brought
back
to
his
grandmother
hecuba
for
the
funeral
rites
a
solitary
old
woman
with
a
dead
child
in
her
arms
that
on
the
human
side
is
the
result
of
these
deeds
of
glory
then
in
the
finale
come
scenes
of
almost
mystical
tone
in
which
hecuba
appeals
first
to
the
gods
who
care
nothing
then
to
the
human
dead
who
did
at
least
care
and
love
but
the
dead
too
are
deaf
like
the
gods
and
can
not
help
or
heed
out
of
the
noise
and
shame
of
battle
there
has
come
death
the
most
holy
and
taken
them
to
his
peace
no
friend
among
the
dead
no
help
in
god
no
illusion
anywhere
hecuba
faces
that
which
is
and
finds
somewhere
in
the
very
intensity
of
troy
affliction
a
splendour
which
can
not
die
she
has
reached
in
some
sense
not
the
bottom
but
the
crowning
peak
of
her
fortunes
troy
has
already
been
set
on
fire
by
the
greeks
in
preparation
for
their
departure
and
the
queen
rushes
to
throw
herself
into
the
flames
she
is
hurled
back
by
the
guards
and
the
women
watch
the
flaming
city
till
with
a
crash
the
great
tower
falls
the
greek
trumpet
sounds
through
the
darkness
it
is
the
sign
for
the
women
to
start
for
their
ships
and
forth
they
go
cheated
of
every
palliative
cheated
even
of
death
to
the
new
life
of
slavery
but
they
have
seen
in
their
very
nakedness
that
there
is
something
in
life
which
neither
slavery
nor
death
can
touch
the
play
is
a
picture
of
the
inner
side
of
a
great
conquest
a
thing
which
then
even
more
than
now
formed
probably
the
very
heart
of
the
dreams
of
the
average
unregenerate
man
it
is
a
thing
that
seemed
beforehand
to
be
a
great
joy
and
is
in
reality
a
great
misery
it
is
conquest
seen
when
the
heat
of
battle
is
over
and
nothing
remains
but
to
wait
and
think
conquest
not
embodied
in
those
who
achieved
it
we
have
but
one
glimpse
of
the
greek
conquerors
and
that
shows
a
man
contemptible
and
unhappy
but
in
those
who
have
experienced
it
most
fully
the
conquered
women
we
have
so
far
treated
the
as
though
it
stood
alone
in
reality
of
course
it
belonged
to
a
group
and
one
can
not
but
ask
what
the
other
plays
were
and
whether
their
themes
were
such
as
could
stand
beside
this
and
not
be
shrivelled
into
commonplace
or
triviality
fortunately
though
the
plays
are
both
lost
we
know
something
about
them
they
were
and
and
both
are
on
great
subjects
the
tells
of
the
righteous
man
condemned
by
an
evil
world
the
has
for
its
hero
a
slave
slavery
had
always
been
one
of
the
subjects
that
haunted
euripides
we
do
not
happen
to
find
in
our
remains
of
his
work
any
definite
pronouncement
that
slavery
is
contrary
to
nature
as
was
held
by
most
greek
philosophers
of
the
succeeding
century
probably
no
practical
man
of
the
time
could
imagine
a
large
industrial
city
living
without
the
institution
of
slavery
but
it
is
clear
that
euripides
hates
it
it
corrupts
a
man
it
makes
the
slave
cowardly
and
untrustworthy
yet
many
slaves
are
better
men
than
their
masters
many
free
men
are
slaves
at
heart
and
again
in
the
style
of
a
stoic
a
man
without
fear
can
not
be
a
slave
fr
cf
fr
much
more
important
than
such
statements
as
these
which
are
according
to
his
manner
generally
put
in
the
mouth
of
a
slave
are
the
many
instances
of
sympathetic
and
courageous
slaves
and
the
panegyrics
on
men
who
have
no
slaves
but
work
with
their
own
hands
these
show
the
bent
of
the
poet
mind
it
is
not
however
till
the
year
of
the
that
he
takes
the
bold
step
of
actually
making
a
slave
his
hero
and
filling
his
play
with
discussions
of
slavery
including
a
definite
contest
in
between
the
slaves
and
the
masters
true
the
slave
turns
out
in
the
end
to
be
a
prince
the
herdsman
whose
favourite
bull
the
young
nobles
have
seized
for
a
sacrifice
and
who
pursues
and
challenges
and
eventually
conquers
them
in
strength
and
skill
as
well
as
magnanimity
turns
out
to
be
alexander
son
of
priam
who
has
been
reared
by
the
slave
herdsmen
of
mt
ida
by
our
standards
that
is
a
pity
we
should
have
preferred
him
a
real
slave
but
probably
on
the
greek
stage
thus
much
of
romance
was
inevitable
and
after
all
it
had
its
connection
with
real
life
many
a
scythian
and
thracian
and
even
phrygian
chief
like
this
alexander
must
have
stood
for
sale
in
greek
slave
markets
the
root
idea
of
the
the
righteous
man
falsely
slain
has
a
momentous
place
in
the
history
of
greek
thought
it
starts
of
course
as
a
bitterness
or
a
paradox
righteousness
to
the
fifth
century
athenian
was
almost
identical
with
social
service
and
in
a
healthy
society
with
normal
conditions
the
man
who
serves
his
city
well
will
naturally
be
honoured
by
his
city
but
then
comes
the
thought
itself
fraught
with
the
wisdom
of
the
sophists
what
if
the
multitude
is
bent
on
evil
or
is
blind
there
are
many
men
who
are
evil
but
seem
righteous
what
if
the
man
who
is
righteous
seems
to
be
evil
hence
come
the
story
of
aias
in
pindar
and
palamedes
in
this
play
and
the
ideal
righteous
man
of
plato
republic
who
shall
be
scourged
tortured
bound
and
at
last
impaled
or
crucified
the
idea
runs
through
the
various
developments
of
later
greek
mysticism
and
attains
its
culminating
point
in
christianity
it
is
in
full
concord
with
the
tone
of
the
we
know
little
of
the
that
hero
was
the
true
wise
man
and
his
enemy
was
odysseus
the
evil
man
who
seemed
wise
and
had
the
ear
of
the
multitude
palamedes
is
falsely
accused
of
treason
condemned
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
his
judges
and
sent
to
death
fragments
tell
us
of
some
friend
perhaps
a
prisoner
carving
message
after
message
upon
and
throwing
them
into
the
sea
that
the
truth
might
be
known
and
we
have
two
beautiful
untranslatable
lines
uttered
by
the
chorus
ye
have
slain
ye
greeks
ye
have
slain
the
nightingale
the
of
the
muses
who
sought
no
man
pain
tradition
saw
in
the
words
a
reference
to
the
wise
protagoras
lately
slandered
to
his
death
the
consideration
of
these
other
plays
of
the
same
trilogy
strengthens
the
impression
that
i
receive
already
from
the
an
impression
of
some
deepening
of
experience
some
profound
change
that
has
worked
into
the
writer
soul
other
critics
and
notably
wilamowitz
and
glover
have
similarly
felt
that
this
play
marks
a
turning
point
it
was
not
a
change
of
front
it
was
not
sudden
it
was
not
dependent
on
visions
or
supernatural
messages
it
was
the
completion
of
a
long
process
of
strong
feeling
and
intense
thought
not
the
less
sane
because
of
its
decided
element
of
mysticism
it
probably
differed
in
many
ways
from
the
sudden
and
conscious
conversions
which
began
the
ministry
of
certain
greek
philosophers
both
cynic
and
stoic
in
the
fourth
and
third
centuries
before
christ
it
differed
still
more
from
the
experience
of
paul
on
the
road
to
damascus
or
augustine
beneath
the
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
in
this
tragedy
the
author
shows
a
greatly
increased
sense
of
some
reality
that
is
behind
appearances
some
loyalty
higher
than
the
claims
of
friends
or
country
which
supersedes
as
both
false
and
inadequate
the
current
moral
code
and
the
current
theologies
chapter
vi
after
the
trojan
women
euripides
last
years
in
athens
from
the
iphigenia
to
the
orestes
critics
have
used
various
words
to
describe
the
change
of
mood
which
followed
the
they
speak
of
a
period
of
despair
pessimism
progressive
bitterness
und
but
such
phrases
seem
to
me
misleading
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
think
they
describe
quite
truly
even
the
particular
plays
they
are
meant
to
describe
in
the
second
they
do
not
allow
for
the
great
variety
which
subsists
in
the
plays
of
this
period
the
mood
of
the
is
not
exactly
pessimism
or
despair
and
whatever
it
is
it
does
not
colour
all
the
subsequent
plays
the
plays
after
fall
into
two
main
divisions
first
the
works
of
pure
fancy
or
romance
in
which
the
poet
seems
to
turn
intentionally
away
from
reality
such
are
the
in
the
and
the
they
move
among
far
seas
and
strange
adventures
and
they
have
happy
endings
next
there
are
the
true
tragedies
close
to
life
ruthlessly
probing
the
depths
of
human
nature
not
more
acutely
bitter
than
such
earlier
works
as
the
and
but
with
a
bitterness
more
profound
because
it
is
comparatively
free
from
indignation
the
glory
has
fallen
away
and
the
burning
anger
with
it
the
poor
miserable
heroes
and
heroines
what
else
can
you
expect
of
them
rage
is
no
good
punishment
worse
than
useless
the
road
to
healing
lies
elsewhere
a
good
key
to
the
first
of
these
types
of
play
is
to
be
seen
in
aristophanes
comedy
the
gayest
sweetest
and
most
irresponsible
of
all
his
plays
it
was
written
just
after
the
news
of
the
final
disaster
in
sicily
when
ruin
stared
athens
in
the
face
and
the
two
heroes
of
it
disgusted
with
the
ways
of
man
depart
to
live
among
the
birds
and
build
with
their
help
a
splendid
cloud
city
in
much
the
same
spirit
euripides
must
have
written
his
he
produced
it
in
the
same
year
in
which
he
was
invited
by
the
government
which
came
into
power
after
the
news
of
the
great
disaster
to
write
the
national
epitaph
on
the
soldiers
slain
in
sicily
he
wrote
the
epitaph
in
the
old
severe
untranslatable
style
of
simonides
these
men
won
eight
victories
over
the
syracusans
when
the
hand
of
god
lay
even
between
both
in
english
it
seems
cold
it
seems
hardly
poetry
but
in
greek
it
is
like
carved
marble
then
one
must
imagine
he
turned
right
away
from
the
present
and
spent
his
days
with
andromeda
only
a
few
fragments
of
the
remain
but
they
are
curiously
beautiful
and
the
play
as
a
whole
seems
to
have
been
the
one
unclouded
that
euripides
ever
wrote
it
was
fantastic
remote
from
life
with
its
heroine
chained
to
a
cliff
over
the
blue
sea
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
and
its
hero
perseus
on
winged
sandals
appearing
through
the
air
to
save
her
yet
the
fragments
have
a
wistful
ring
o
holy
night
how
long
is
the
path
of
thy
chariot
by
the
mercy
that
dwelleth
in
the
sea
caves
cease
o
echo
let
me
weep
my
fill
in
peace
or
the
strange
lines
fr
methinks
it
is
the
morrow
day
by
day
that
cows
us
and
the
coming
thing
alway
greater
than
things
or
yesterday
there
was
a
story
told
in
later
times
of
a
that
fell
on
the
folk
of
abdêra
in
thrace
through
this
play
till
in
every
street
you
could
see
young
men
walking
as
though
in
a
dream
and
murmuring
to
themselves
the
speech
beginning
o
love
high
monarch
over
gods
and
men
the
was
five
hundred
years
old
when
people
told
that
story
the
in
came
one
year
earlier
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
extant
plays
not
really
a
tragedy
in
our
sense
nor
yet
merely
a
romance
it
begins
in
gloom
and
rises
to
a
sense
of
peril
to
swift
and
dangerous
adventure
to
joyful
escape
so
far
it
is
like
romance
but
it
is
tragic
in
the
sincerity
of
the
iphigenîa
especially
with
her
mixed
longings
for
revenge
and
for
affection
her
hatred
of
the
greece
that
wronged
her
and
her
love
of
the
greece
that
is
her
only
home
her
possibilities
of
stony
cruelty
and
her
realities
of
swift
is
a
true
child
of
her
great
and
accursed
house
the
plot
is
as
follows
iphigenîa
daughter
of
agamemnon
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
sacrificed
by
her
father
at
aulis
was
really
saved
by
artemis
and
is
now
priestess
to
that
goddess
in
the
land
of
the
taurians
at
the
extremity
of
the
friendless
sea
the
taurians
are
savages
who
kill
all
strangers
and
if
ever
a
greek
shall
land
in
the
wild
place
it
will
be
her
task
to
prepare
him
for
sacrifice
she
lives
with
this
terror
hanging
over
her
and
the
first
greek
that
comes
is
her
unknown
brother
orestes
their
recognition
of
one
another
is
perhaps
the
finest
in
all
tragedy
and
with
its
sequels
of
stratagem
and
escape
forms
a
thrilling
play
haunted
not
like
a
tragedy
by
the
shadow
of
death
but
rather
by
the
shadow
of
homesickness
the
characters
are
greeks
in
a
far
barbarian
land
longing
for
home
or
even
for
the
greek
sea
the
lyrics
are
particularly
fine
and
most
of
them
full
of
and
the
clash
of
waters
in
the
same
year
as
the
came
another
romantic
play
the
it
is
a
good
deal
like
the
in
structure
but
it
is
lighter
harder
and
more
artificial
the
romance
of
euripides
is
never
quite
the
easy
dreaming
of
writers
and
the
in
which
he
seems
to
have
attempted
a
work
of
mere
fancy
is
if
we
understand
it
rightly
a
rather
brilliant
failure
some
critics
quite
mistakenly
in
my
judgment
have
even
argued
that
it
is
a
parody
the
plot
is
based
on
a
variant
of
the
canonical
legend
about
helen
a
variant
generally
associated
with
the
ancient
lyric
poet
stesichorus
story
tells
that
stesichorus
at
one
time
lost
his
eyesight
and
took
it
into
his
head
that
this
was
a
punishment
laid
on
him
by
the
goddess
helen
because
he
had
told
the
story
of
her
flight
with
paris
from
her
husband
house
he
wrote
a
recantation
based
on
another
form
of
the
in
which
helen
was
borne
away
by
the
god
hermes
to
egypt
and
there
lived
like
a
true
wife
till
menelaus
came
and
found
her
the
being
that
went
with
paris
to
troy
was
only
a
phantom
image
of
helen
contrived
by
the
gods
in
order
to
bring
about
the
war
and
so
reduce
the
wickedness
and
multitude
of
mankind
in
euripides
play
there
is
a
wicked
king
of
egypt
who
seeks
to
marry
helen
against
her
will
and
kills
all
greeks
who
land
in
his
country
the
war
at
troy
is
over
and
menelaus
beaten
by
storms
out
of
his
way
is
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
egypt
he
and
helen
meet
recognize
one
another
and
by
the
help
of
the
king
sister
who
has
second
sight
contrive
to
escape
it
is
hard
to
say
what
exactly
is
wrong
with
the
and
it
may
only
be
that
we
moderns
do
not
know
in
what
spirit
to
take
it
but
the
illusion
is
difficult
to
keep
up
and
the
work
seems
cold
reality
has
gone
out
of
it
for
one
thing
helen
in
her
thorough
process
of
rehabilitation
has
emerged
that
most
insipid
of
fancies
a
perfectly
beautiful
and
blameless
heroine
with
no
character
except
love
of
her
husband
whom
by
the
way
she
has
not
seen
for
seventeen
years
another
large
experiment
of
this
time
is
the
or
it
is
the
longest
greek
tragedy
in
existence
and
covers
the
greatest
stretch
of
story
aeschylus
we
remember
had
the
habit
of
writing
true
trilogies
three
continuous
dramas
carrying
on
the
same
history
the
seems
like
an
attempt
to
run
the
matter
of
a
whole
trilogy
into
one
play
it
does
not
fall
into
either
of
the
divisions
which
i
have
sketched
above
it
is
neither
a
play
of
fancy
nor
yet
a
realistic
tragedy
but
even
if
we
had
no
external
tradition
of
its
date
we
could
tell
to
what
part
of
the
author
life
it
belongs
it
is
written
as
it
is
conceived
in
the
large
and
heroic
style
but
it
shows
in
the
regular
manner
of
this
period
a
general
clash
of
hatreds
and
frantic
ambitions
and
revenges
and
cruel
statesmanship
standing
out
against
the
light
of
a
young
man
heroism
and
a
mother
and
a
love
it
is
like
euripides
too
that
this
beautiful
mother
should
be
jocasta
whose
unknowing
incest
had
made
her
an
abomination
in
the
eyes
of
orthodox
greece
the
play
tells
the
story
of
thebes
the
sin
of
oedipus
and
jocasta
is
a
thing
of
the
past
oedipus
has
blinded
himself
and
cursed
his
children
and
they
have
in
course
of
time
imprisoned
him
in
the
vaults
of
the
palace
jocasta
still
lives
the
sons
polyneices
and
eteocles
have
agreed
to
reign
by
turns
polyneices
the
elder
has
reigned
his
year
and
gone
abroad
to
argos
eteocles
having
once
got
the
crown
has
refused
to
yield
it
up
polyneices
comes
with
an
argive
army
to
lay
siege
to
thebes
and
win
his
rights
by
war
the
drama
is
developed
in
a
series
of
great
pictures
we
have
first
the
princess
antigone
with
an
old

it
is
polyneices
the

has
induced
her

to

they

the

reveals
nothing
but
ambition
and
mutual

they

another
on

polyneices
goes
there
are

in
the
beleaguered

creon
who
is
jocasta
brother

a
sort
of
prime
minister
advises
the
rash
eteocles
but
the
prophets
must
be
consulted
too
that
the
gods
may
be
favourable
the
prophet
tiresias
blind
and
old
and
jealous
as
so
often
in
greek
tragedy
proclaims
that
the
only
medicine
to
save
the

is
for
creon
son
menoikeus
to
be
slain

dismisses
the
prophet

for
his

to
escape
from
thebes

fly
to
the

of
greece
the
boy
feigns
consent
to
the
plan
of

but
as
soon
as
his

has
left
him
rushes
enthusiastically
up

a

its

what
of
the
two
brothers
he
must
go
now
and
will
bring
more
news
jocasta
sees
he
is
concealing
something
and
compels
him
to
speak
the
truth
comes
out
the
brothers
are
preparing
a
single
combat
with
a
shriek
the
mother
calls
antigone
and
the
two
women
young
and
old
make
their
way
through
the
army
to
try
to
separate
the
men
we
learn
from
a
second
messenger
how
the
brothers
have
slain
each
other
in
a
meadow
of
wild
lotus
and
jocasta
has
killed
herself
with
one
of
their
swords
antigone
returns
and
to
bring
the
news
to
her
only
friend
the
blind
oedipus
creon
by
eteocles
charge
takes
over
the
government
he
too
a
man
but
none
the
less
ruthless
he
proclaims
that
polyneices
body
shall
lie
unburied
and
that
oedipus
the
source
of
pollution
shall
be
cast
out
of
the
land
antigone
meantime
shall
marry
creon
son
haemon
antigone
defies
him
she
will
not
wed
haemon
nor
any
of
creon
kin
her
father
shall
not
be
cast
out
to
die
for
she
will
go
with
him
and
protect
him
polyneices
shall
not
lie
unburied
for
she
herself
will
return
by
stealth
and
bury
him
there
is
still
one
human
love
that
oedipus
yearns
for
most
that
of
the
wife
and
mother
who
is
lying
dead
in
the
meadow
of

lotus

meantime
he
takes
the
hand
of
his
daughter
old
man
and
young
maiden
they
go
forth
together
away
from
the
brutalities
of
human
kind
to
the
high
mountains
to
the
holy
inviolate
places
on
kithairon
where
only
the
wild
white
women
of
dionysus
dance
their
mystic
dances
the
stands
half
way
between
the
pure
romances
and
the
tragedies
of
the
last
period
of
these
latter
the
clearest
type
is
the
probably
a
play
which
before
it
was
understood
used
to
receive
the
unstinted
abuse
of
critics
as
the
meanest
of
greek
tragedies
the
very
worst
of
all
euripides
plays
it
deals
with
the
moral
problem
of
the
stated
in
its
sharpest
terms
now
the
we
must
realize
in
any
society
where
there
is
no
public
law
and
no
police
is
a
high
moral
duty
a
man
commits
an
abominable
crime
and
revels
in
comfort
on
the
proceeds
his
victim
is
dead
and
there
is
no
law
which
will
act
automatically
it
becomes
the
duty
of
some
one
normally
the
heir
or
representative
of
the
dead
man
to
devote
himself
to
the
work
of
justice
to
forsake
all
business
and
pleasure
in
life
till
the
wrong
has
been
righted
and
the
dead
man
avenged
a
man
who
would
let
his
kinsman
be
murdered
and
then
live
on
at
his
ease
rather
than
pursue
the
murderer
would
obviously
be
a
poor
false
creature
now
comes
the
problem
the
strongest
possible
claim
is
that
of
a
father
murdered
the
most
horrible
act
a
greek
could
conceive
was
for
a
man
to
slay
his
mother
suppose
a
wife
murdered
her
husband
ought
her
son
to
slay
her
the
law
of
the
as
traditionally
preached
from
the
temple
of
apollo
at
delphi
answered
in
spite
of
all
repugnances
yes
the
story
had
been
treated
before
euripides
by
many
poets
including
homer
stesichorus
pindar
aeschylus
and
possibly
though
the
dates
are
not
certain
sophocles
clytemnestra
had
with
the
help
of
her
lover
aegisthus
murdered
her
husband
agamemnon
her
son
orestes
slays
her
in
obedience
to
apollo
command
and
his
sister
electra
aids
him
aeschylus
in
his
had
dealt
with
this
theme
on
broad
lines
and
with
gorgeous
intensity
of
imagination
his
orestes
is
carried
to
the
deed
on
a
great
wave
of
religious
passion
and
goes
mad
as
soon
as
it
is
done
the
deed
as
commanded
by
god
is
right
but
it
is
too
much
for
human
nature
to
endure
in
an
ensuing
play
orestes
after
long
sufferings
is
tried
for
the
matricide
and
when
the
human
judges
are
evenly
divided
acquitted
by
the
divine
voice
of
athena
sophocles
treats
the
subject
very
differently
he
makes
a
most
brilliant
play
with
extraordinary
clashes
of
emotion
and
moments
of
tragic
beauty
but
evidently
of
set
purpose
he
makes
the
whole
treatment
hard
and
archaic
there
is
no
shrinking
back
no
question
of
conscience
at
all
clytemnestra
is
a
furious
tyrant
she
beats
electra
with
her
fists
and
aegisthus
does
worse
the
climax
of
the
play
is
not
the
but
the
killing
of
aegisthus
which
was
presumably
the
harder
and
more
exciting
job
when
orestes
and
his
friend
pylades
come
out
of
the
palace
streaming
with
clytemnestra
blood
their
nerves
are
unshaken
and
the
chorus
is
careful
to
say
that
they
are
not
to
be
in
any
way
blamed
the
spirit
of
euripides
is
exactly
the
opposite
so
much
so
indeed
that
most
critics
feel
clear
that
the
two
plays
are
closely
related
and
related
in
opposition
the
one
is
a
deliberate
protest
against
the
other
unfortunately
the
play
of
sophocles
can
not
be
dated
and
it
is
not
clear
from
internal
evidence
which
play
was
written
first
in
the
of
euripides
we
find
two
main
qualities
first
there
is
psychological
realism
of
the
subtlest
kind
secondly
there
is
a
new
moral
atmosphere
with
a
power
of
sympathy
and
analysis
unrivalled
in
ancient
drama
he
has
imagined
just
what
kind
of
people
these
children
must
have
been
who
would
thus
through
long
years
nurse
the
seeds
of
hatred
and
at
the
end
kill
their
mother
he
studies
them
all
electra
a
mixture
of
heroism
and
broken
nerves
a
poisoned
and
haunted
woman
eating
her
heart
in
ceaseless
broodings
of
hate
and
love
both
alike
unsatisfied
for
he
suggests
somewhat
cruelly
that
she
might
have
lived
contentedly
enough
had
she
only
had
a
normal
married
life
the
name
in
its
original
doric
form
suggested
the
meaning
orestes
is
a
youth
bred
in
the
unwholesome
dreams
of
exile
and
now
swept
away
by
his
sister
stronger
will
subject
also
as
orestes
always
is
in
greek
tragedy
to
delusions
and
melancholy
madness
the
mother
herself
is
not
forgotten
and
a
most
piteous
figure
she
shows
this
sad
woman
whose
first
words
are
an
apology
controlling
quickly
her
old
fires
anxious
to
be
as
little
hated
as
possible
ready
even
to
atone
for
her
crime
if
only
there
were
some
safe
way
of
atonement
thus
in
the
first
place
euripides
has
stripped
the
old
bloody
deed
of
the
heroic
glamour
that
surrounded
it
his
actors
are
not
heroes
moving
straight
to
their
purpose
they
are
human
creatures
erring
broken
by
passion
mastered
by
their
own
inhibitions
and
doubts
and
regrets
in
the
second
place
he
has
no
doubt
at
all
about
the
ethics
of
the
it
was
an
abomination
and
the
god
who
ordained
it
if
any
did
was
a
power
of
darkness
after
the
deed
the
two
murderers
come
forth
as
in
sophocles
but
this
time
they
are
not
triumphant
and
the
chorus
does
not
hail
them
as
having
done
right
they
reel
from
the
door
and
ghastly
and
break
into
a
long
agony
of
remorse
the
chorus
share
their
horror
electra
guilt
is
the
greater
since
she
drove
her
brother
to
the
deed
against
his
will
even
while
they
love
her
they
can
not
quite
forget
that
though
they
feel
that
now
at
last
by
this
anguish
her
heart
may
be
made
clean
within
the
play
ends
with
an
appearance
of
the
gods
the
heavenly
horsemen
castor
and
polydeuces
who
were
kinsmen
of
the
dead
appear
on
a
cloud
and
speak
in
judgement
and
comfort
with
a
definiteness
rare
in
euripides
they
pronounce
the
deed
of
vengeance
to
be
evil
and
phoebus
phoebus
nay
he
is
my
lord
therefore
i
hold
my
peace
but
though
in
light
he
dwell
not
light
was
this
he
showed
to
thee
but
darkness
another
note
is
also
struck
that
of
pity
for
the
suffering
of
humanity
orestes
and
electra
condemned
to
part
break
as
they
bid
one
another
farewell
into
a
great
cry
and
the
gods
hearing
it
are
shaken
alas
what
would
ye
for
that
cry
ourselves
and
all
the
sons
of
heaven
have
pity
yea
our
peace
is
riven
by
the
strange
pain
of
these
that
die
but
hark
the
far
sicilian
sea
calls
and
a
noise
of
men
and
ships
that
labour
sunken
to
the
lips
in
bitter
billows
forth
go
we
with
saving
they
speak
such
words
of
comfort
and
groping
wisdom
as
they
can
find
no
one
has
ever
claimed
that
they
are
omniscient
and
depart
upon
their
own
eternal
task
which
is
not
to
punish
but
to
save
the
appearance
of
the
gods
in
the
is
so
beautiful
that
no
critics
have
yet
tried
to
explain
it
away
as
nonsense
and
the
lesson
of
it
so
clear
that
its
meaning
is
seldom
denied
but
i
find
just
the
same
lesson
in
the
final
scene
of
the
which
is
commonly
taken
as
the
very
worst
instance
of
euripides
habit
of
closing
with
a
god
from
the
machine
the
deals
with
the
fate
of
orestes
some
days
after
his
mother
murder
he
is
mad
and
sick
his
sister
is
nursing
him
with
devotion
the
people
have
risen
against
them
and
they
are
held
prisoners
in
the
palace
till
an
assembly
shall
try
them
for
murder
and
pronounce
their
fate
meantime
menelaus
orestes
uncle
and
king
of
sparta
has
arrived
at
the
harbour
with
his
wife
helen
and
their
daughter
hermione
he
has
sent
on
his
wife
and
daughter
to
the
palace
and
is
expected
hourly
himself
he
is
agamemnon
brother
he
has
with
him
an
army
of
trojan
veterans
he
can
surely
be
counted
on
to
cow
the
argive
populace
and
save
his
dead
brother
son
all
our
hopes
hang
on
menelaus
and
when
at
last
he
comes
he
proves
false
he
would
like
to
help
but
it
would
be
wrong
for
him
a
foreigner
to
dictate
to
the
argives
and
he
has
only
a
very
small
force
with
him
however
he
will
reason
with
orestes
enemies
one
does
not
forget
that
if
argos
is
left
without
a
king
menelaus
will
normally
inherit
the
sick
man
blazes
into
rage
against
him
and
menelaus
becomes
an
open
enemy
exasperation
follows
on
exasperation
orestes
friend
pylades
breaks
through
the
guards
and
enters
the
palace
to
share
the
prisoners
fate
the
assembly
hears
and
at
length
condemns
them
they
are
given
a
day
in
which
to
die
as
they
best
please
like
scorpions
surrounded
by
fire
the
three
orestes
electra
and
pylades
begin
to
strike
blindly
a
brilliant
idea
they
can
kill
helen
that
will
punish
menelaus
and
helen
deserves
many
deaths
better
still
kill
helen
and
then
capture
hermione
hold
a
dagger
at
her
throat
and
then
bargain
with
menelaus
for
help
even
at
the
last
hour
murder
his
wife
and
then
force
him
to
help
splendid
the
madness
of
orestes
infects
the
whole
play
helen
escapes
being
but
they
catch
hermione
who
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
always
been
kind
to
them
menelaus
who
has
heard
news
from
an
escaping
slave
rushes
up
to
save
helen
but
he
finds
no
sign
of
her
he
finds
only
the
palace
barred
and
the
madman
on
the
roof
shrieking
derision
and
holding
the
knife
at
his
daughter
throat
there
is
a
brief
wild
attempt
at
bargaining
then
hate
in
menelaus
overcomes
fear
he
rejects
all
terms
orestes
party
sets
fire
to
the
palace
and
menelaus
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
beats
blindly
at
the
barred
gate
the
fire
of
hell
to
use
phrase
has
been
let
loose
rage
hatred
revenge
all
blazing
to
the
point
of
madness
what
more
can
befall
what
does
befall
is
strange
and
daring
an
entry
of
a
god
not
in
gentleness
not
with
any
preparation
or
introduction
but
sudden
and
terrific
striking
all
beholders
into
a
trance
from
which
they
awaken
changed
men
the
point
has
not
been
generally
observed
though
it
is
i
think
clear
at
apollo
first
sudden
cry
menelaus
be
still
line
we
know
that
orestes
is
supporting
hermione
in
one
arm
while
with
the
other
hand
he
is
holding
the
knife
at
her
throat
he
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
at
line
he
only
moves
from
it
at
that
is
the
conduct
of
a
man
in
a
trance
suddenly
as
it
were
struck
rigid
and
we
shall
find
that
the
words
spoken
by
both
menelaus
and
orestes
when
apollo
has
finished
his
charge
are
like
nothing
but
the
words
of
men
emerging
from
a
trance
a
trance
too
of
some
supernatural
kind
like
that
for
instance
which
falls
on
the
raging
world
in
wells
book
the
days
of
the
here
too
a
raging
world
wakes
to
find
itself
at
peace
and
its
past
hatreds
unintelligible
and
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
the
surface
is
in
each
case
the
great
guiding
preoccupation
of
each
man
life
with
menelaus
it
is
helen
with
orestes
the
oracle
that
made
him
sin
nay
more
when
orestes
wakens
to
find
hermione
lying
in
his
arms
his
natural
movement
as
experiments
on
hypnotized
persons
have
shown
is
to
accept
the
suggestion
and
draw
her
to
him
in
love
greek
legend
knew
well
that
as
a
matter
of
history
hermione
became
orestes
bride
there
is
daring
perhaps
excessive
daring
in
making
it
occur
this
way
but
the
psychology
of
something
like
hypnotism
had
a
fascination
for
both
aeschylus
and
euripides
for
the
rest
apollo
has
spoken
the
word
of
forgiveness
and
reconciliation
he
concludes
depart
now
each
upon
his
destined
way
your
hates
dead
and
forgotten
men
i
obey
or
i
too
mine
heart
is
as
a
wine
of
peace
poured
with
the
past
and
thy
dark
mysteries
apollo
go
now
your
ways
and
without
cease
give
honour
in
your
hearts
to
one
of
spirits
all
beneath
the
sun
most
beautiful
her
name
is
peace
i
rise
with
helen
past
the
orb
of
many
a
shining
star
where
heracles
and
hebe
are
and
hera
she
shall
reign
at
last
a
goddess
in
men
prayers
to
be
for
ever
with
her
brethren
twain
enthronèd
a
great
help
in
pain
and
queen
of
the
eternal
sea
helen
a
goddess
say
some
critics
the
notion
is
impossible
we
have
seen
her
in
this
same
play
a
heartless
ordinary
woman
yet
i
think
euripides
was
serious
enough
i
do
not
say
he
believed
either
this
or
any
other
particular
bit
of
the
mythology
but
he
was
writing
seriously
and
aiming
at
beauty
not
at
satire
all
legend
said
that
helen
was
made
a
goddess
and
euripides
was
always
curiously
haunted
by
the
thought
of
helen
and
by
the
mysterious
and
deadly
power
of
mere
superlative
beauty
as
apollo
had
said
to
menelaus
thy
bride
shall
be
another
none
may
know
for
the
gods
to
work
much
death
and
woe
devised
this
loveliness
all
dreams
above
that
men
in
greece
and
troy
for
thirst
thereof
should
strive
and
die
and
so
the
old
earth
win
peace
from
mankind
great
multitude
and
sin
the
superlative
beauty
may
probably
enough
be
found
in
company
with
heartlessness
and
treachery
but
can
not
these
things
be
purged
away
like
the
hates
of
menelaus
and
orestes
and
the
pure
beauty
remain
a
thing
to
pray
to
and
be
helped
by
much
as
the
old
sagas
pretend
there
is
here
again
the
touch
of
mysticism
but
however
it
be
about
helen
or
even
about
the
above
explanation
in
detail
of
the
last
scene
of
the
it
is
clear
that
both
the
most
characteristic
plays
of
the
period
of
gloom
end
with
a
strong
almost
a
mystically
strong
note
of
peace
and
reconciliation
this
note
occurs
though
with
less
intensity
at
the
end
of
other
late
plays
such
as
the
in
and
the
and
though
without
a
god
in
the
it
does
not
occur
at
all
in
the
early
plays
the
and
end
in
pure
hate
the
ends
in
wonderful
beauty
and
a
reconciliation
between
the
hero
and
his
father
who
are
natural
friends
but
it
keeps
up
the
feud
of
aphrodite
and
artemis
and
contains
a
strange
threat
of
vengeance
ff
the
lovely
thetis
of
the
brings
comfort
and
rest
but
preaches
no
forgiveness
on
the
contrary
the
body
of
pyrrhus
is
to
be
buried
at
delphi
as
an
eternal
reproach
euripides
all
through
his
life
was
occupied
with
the
study
of
revenge
it
was
a
time
as
thucydides
tells
us
when
men
tried
to
surpass
all
the
record
of
previous
times
in
the
ingenuity
of
their
enterprises
and
the
enormity
of
their
revenges
euripides
seems
first
to
have
been
almost
fascinated
by
the
enormous
revenges
at
least
when
they
were
the
work
of
people
who
had
suffered
enormous
wrong
he
seems
in
plays
like
the
to
be
saying
if
you
goad
people
beyond
endurance
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
must
expect
them
to
do
and
serve
you
right
in
the
plays
after
the
emphasis
has
rather
changed
you
must
expect
to
be
wronged
and
revenge
will
do
good
to
nobody
seek
peace
and
forgive
one
another
chapter
vii
macedonia
the
iphigenia
in
aulis
the
bacchae
thus
we
come
round
to
the
figure
from
which
we
started
the
old
sad
man
with
the
long
beard
who
seldom
laughed
and
was
not
easy
to
speak
to
who
sat
for
long
hours
in
his
seaward
cave
on
salamis
meditating
and
perhaps
writing
one
could
not
tell
what
except
indeed
that
it
was
something
great
and
high
it
was
natural
that
he
should
be
sad
his
dreams
were
overthrown
his
city
his
beloved
had
turned
worse
than
false
public
life
was
in
every
way
tenfold
more
intimate
and
important
to
an
ancient
greek
than
it
is
to
us
moderns
who
seldom
eat
a
the
less
when
our
worst
political
enemies
pass
their
most
detested
bills
and
athens
had
not
only
been
false
to
her
ideals
she
had
sinned
for
the
sake
of
success
and
had
then
failed
and
her
failure
probably
made
the
daily
life
of
her
citizens
a
thing
of
anxiety
and
discomfort
you
were
never
quite
sure
of
your
daily
food
you
were
never
quite
safe
from
a
triumphant
raid
of
the
enemy
and
the
habitual
bodily
discomfort
which
is
the
central
fact
of
old
age
must
have
had
for
euripides
much
to
aggravate
and
little
to
soften
it
it
was
natural
too
that
his
people
should
hate
him
nations
at
war
do
not
easily
forgive
those
who
denounce
their
wars
as
unjust
when
the
war
in
spite
of
all
heroism
goes
against
them
their
resentment
is
all
the
bitterer
there
is
of
course
not
the
ghost
of
a
suggestion
in
euripides
that
he
thought
the
spartans
right
or
that
he
wished
athens
to
be
defeated
far
from
it
but
the
athenian
public
was
not
in
a
mood
for
subtle
distinctions
and
his
air
of
disapproval
was
enough
besides
thought
the
meaner
among
them
the
man
was
a
known
blasphemer
he
had
been
the
friend
of
the
sophists
he
had
denied
the
gods
worse
he
had
denounced
the
doings
of
the
gods
as
evil
these
misfortunes
that
hurtled
round
the
city
head
must
surely
be
sent
for
some
good
reason
very
likely
just
because
the
city
corrupted
by
the
charm
of
words
had
allowed
such
wicked
sophists
to
live
he
was
at
one
time
prosecuted
for
impiety
we
do
not
know
the
date
or
the
details
but
he
seems
to
have
been
acquitted
the
day
of
socrates
had
not
yet
come
but
other
charges
remained
he
was
a
wicked
old
man
he
had
preached
dreadful
things
about
women
he
had
defended
in
his
plays
adulteresses
and
perjurers
and
workers
of
incest
what
must
his
personal
life
be
if
these
were
his
principles
no
wonder
that
he
lived
so
secretly
he
and
his
wife
and
that
secretary
cephisophon
perhaps
he
was
a
miser
and
had
secret
stores
of
wealth
we
hear
of
an
action
brought
against
him
on
these
lines
a
certain
hygiainon
was
selected
as
a
rich
man
to
perform
some
liturgy
or
public
service
at
his
own
cost
and
he
claimed
that
euripides
was
richer
and
should
be
made
to
do
it
instead
we
do
not
know
the
result
of
the
trial
we
only
know
that
the
plaintiff
attempted
to
create
prejudice
against
euripides
by
quoting
the
line
of
the
see
above
which
was
supposed
to
defend
perjury
these
things
were
annoyances
enough
but
there
must
have
been
some
darker
cloud
that
fell
over
euripides
life
at
this
time
for
we
are
not
only
told
in
the
lives
that
the
athenians
bore
a
grudge
against
him
and
that
he
lost
patience
with
the
of
his
but
one
of
our
earliest
witnesses
philodemus
says
that
when
he
left
athens
he
did
so
in
grief
because
almost
all
in
athens
were
rejoicing
over
him
the
word
used
means
like
the
german
schadenfreude
rejoicing
at
another
injury
so
there
must
have
been
some
injury
for
them
to
rejoice
at
the
old
satyrus
tradition
with
its
tone
of
scandal
and
misunderstanding
says
that
his
wife
was
false
to
him
but
the
story
will
not
bear
historical
criticism
and
it
would
not
be
safe
to
use
so
rotten
a
foundation
to
build
any
theory
upon
however
likely
it
may
be
in
itself
that
a
man
of
this
kind
should
meet
with
domestic
unhappiness
in
one
or
other
of
its
many
forms
in
thinking
of
euripides
one
is
constantly
reminded
of
tolstoy
and
there
are
many
ways
of
making
husbands
miserable
besides
merely
betraying
them
whatever
the
cause
shortly
after
the
production
of
the
in
the
old
poet
endurance
snapped
and
at
the
age
apparently
of
he
struck
off
into
voluntary
exile
it
is
only
one
instance
among
many
of
his
extraordinary
vital
force
the
language
of
the
ancient
life
is
unfortunately
confused
just
here
but
it
seems
to
say
that
he
went
first
to
magnesia
with
which
city
he
had
had
relations
in
earlier
days
he
had
been
granted
some
civic
honours
there
and
had
acted
as
proxenus
a
kind
of
consul
or
general
protector
for
magnesians
in
athens
there
was
more
than
one
town
of
the
name
but
the
one
meant
is
probably
a
large
town
in
the
maeander
valley
not
far
from
ephesus
it
lay
in
persian
territory
but
had
been
granted
by
artaxerxes
to
the
great
themistocles
as
a
gift
and
was
still
ruled
subject
to
the
persian
king
by
themistocles
descendants
doubtless
it
was
to
them
that
the
poet
went
we
know
nothing
more
except
that
he
did
not
stay
long
in
magnesia
but
went
on
to
another
place
where
barbarians
or
were
ruled
by
a
greek
dynasty
the
king
of
macedon
archelaus
an
able
despot
who
was
now
laying
the
seeds
of
the
great
kingdom
which
before
the
lapse
of
a
century
was
to
produce
philip
and
alexander
the
great
had
always
an
eye
for
men
of
genius
who
might
be
attracted
to
his
court
he
had
invited
euripides
before
and
now
renewed
his
invitation
other
men
of
wisdom
were
already
with
archelaus
agathon
the
tragic
poet
timotheus
the
now
famous
musician
whom
euripides
had
once
saved
so
the
story
ran
from
suicide
zeuxis
the
greatest
painter
of
the
time
and
perhaps
also
thucydides
the
historian
it
would
not
be
like
living
among
barbarians
or
even
uncultivated
greeks
and
it
is
likely
enough
that
the
old
man
hankered
for
the
ease
and
comfort
for
the
atmosphere
of
daily
spoiling
which
the
royal
patron
was
likely
to
provide
for
a
lion
of
such
special
rarity
for
it
must
have
been
a
little
before
this
time
that
greece
was
ringing
with
a
tale
of
the
value
set
on
euripides
in
distant
and
hostile
sicily
seven
thousand
athenians
had
been
made
slaves
in
syracuse
after
the
failure
of
the
expedition
and
the
story
now
came
that
some
of
them
had
been
actually
granted
their
freedom
because
they
were
able
to
recite
speeches
and
choruses
of
euripides
apparently
there
was
no
book
trade
between
the
warring
cities
and
the
syracusans
could
only
learn
the
great
poems
by
word
of
mouth
sicily
and
macedonia
were
proud
to
show
that
they
appreciated
the
highest
poetry
better
than
athens
did
it
was
a
curious
haven
that
euripides
found
in
many
ways
macedonia
must
have
been
like
a
great
fragment
of
that
homeric
or
heroic
age
from
which
he
had
drawn
most
of
his
stories
the
scenery
was
all
on
the
grand
scale
there
were
greater
plains
and
forests
and
rivers
wilder
and
higher
mountain
ranges
than
in
the
rest
of
greece
and
the
people
though
ruled
by
a
dynasty
of
greek
descent
and
struggling
up
towards
hellenism
was
still
tribal
military
and
barbaric
a
century
later
we
hear
of
the
old
macedonian
customs
a
young
man
might
not
dine
at
the
men
tables
till
he
had
killed
his
first
wild
boar
he
had
to
wear
a
leathern
halter
round
his
waist
until
he
had
killed
his
first
man
we
hear
that
when
some
macedonian
at
the
court
made
a
rude
remark
to
euripides
the
king
straightway
handed
him
over
to
the
athenian
to
be
scourged
a
but
embarrassing
intervention
and
the
story
told
of
euripides
own
death
if
mythical
is
very
likely
faithful
in
its
local
colour
there
was
a
village
in
macedonia
where
some
thracians
had
once
settled
and
their
descendants
still
lived
one
of
the
king
big
molossian
hounds
once
strayed
into
this
place
and
the
natives
promptly
killed
and
ate
her
the
king
fined
the
village
a
talent
which
was
more
than
it
could
possibly
pay
and
some
dreadful
fate
might
have
overtaken
the
had
not
euripides
interceded
and
begged
them
off
and
not
long
afterwards
the
story
continues
archelaus
was
preparing
a
hunt
and
the
hungry
hounds
were
set
loose
and
it
so
happened
that
euripides
was
sitting
alone
in
a
wood
outside
the
city
and
the
hounds
fell
on
him
and
tore
him
to
pieces
and
behold
these
hounds
proved
to
be
the
children
of
that
molossian
who
through
the
poet
interference
had
died
unavenged
the
story
can
hardly
be
true
or
we
should
hear
some
echo
of
it
in
aristophanes
but
no
doubt
it
was
the
kind
of
fate
that
a
lonely
man
might
well
meet
in
macedonia
when
the
hounds
were
astir
how
the
poet
really
died
we
do
not
know
we
know
that
he
left
athens
after
the
spring
of
and
that
he
was
dead
some
time
before
the
production
of
the
in
january
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
the
story
given
in
the
life
that
when
sophocles
in
the
previous
year
was
introducing
his
chorus
in
the
proagon
or
preliminary
appearance
he
brought
them
on
without
the
customary
garlands
in
mourning
for
his
great
rival
death
the
news
therefore
must
have
reached
athens
by
the
end
of
march
euripides
had
lived
only
some
eighteen
months
in
macedon
the
time
was
not
long
but
it
was
momentous
after
his
death
three
plays
were
found
in
and
sufficiently
finished
to
be
put
on
the
stage
together
by
his
third
son
the
younger
euripides
two
of
them
are
still
extant
and
one
the
remains
for
all
time
to
testify
to
the
extraordinary
return
of
youth
which
came
to
the
old
poet
in
his
last
year
a
lightning
before
death
if
ever
there
was
one
but
let
us
take
first
the
in
it
is
a
play
full
of
problems
we
can
make
out
that
it
was
seriously
incomplete
at
the
death
and
was
finished
by
another
hand
presumably
that
of
its
producer
unfortunately
we
do
not
possess
even
that
version
in
a
complete
form
for
the
archetype
of
our
mss
was
at
some
time
mutilated
and
the
present
end
of
the
play
is
a
patent
forgery
but
if
we
allow
for
these
defects
the
in
is
a
unique
and
most
interesting
example
of
a
particular
moment
in
the
history
of
greek
drama
it
shows
the
between
the
old
fifth
century
tragedy
and
the
new
comedy
which
in
the
hands
of
menander
philemon
and
others
dominated
the
stage
of
the
fourth
and
third
centuries
euripides
had
united
two
tendencies
on
the
one
hand
he
had
moved
towards
freedom
in
metre
realism
in
variety
and
adventure
in
the
realm
of
plot
on
the
other
he
had
strongly
maintained
the
formal
and
musical
character
of
the
old
dionysiac
ritual
making
full
use
of
such
conventions
as
the
prologue
the
epiphany
the
traditional
tragic
diction
and
above
all
the
chorus
the
new
comedy
dropped
the
chorus
brought
the
diction
close
to
real
life
broke
up
the
stiff
forms
and
revelled
in
romance
variety
and
adventure
its
characters
ceased
to
be
legendary
kings
and
queens
they
became
fictional
characters
from
ordinary
city
life
the
in
shows
an
unfinished
euripidean
tragedy
much
in
the
manner
of
the
completed
by
a
man
of
some
genius
whose
true
ideals
were
those
of
modernity
and
the
new
comedy
two
openings
of
the
play
are
preserved
one
is
the
old
stiff
euripidean
prologue
the
other
a
fine
and
vigorous
scene
of
lyric
dialogue
which
must
have
suited
the
taste
of
the
time
far
better
just
as
it
suits
our
own
we
have
early
in
the
play
a
messenger
but
instead
of
his
entrance
being
formally
prepared
and
announced
in
the
euripidean
manner
he
bursts
on
to
the
stage
interrupting
a
speaker
in
the
middle
of
a
verse
and
the
middle
of
a
sentence
there
are
also
peculiarities
of
metre
such
as
the
elision
of
which
are
unheard
of
in
tragic
dialogue
but
regular
in
the
more
conversational
style
of
the
new
comedy
the
plot
runs
it
is
night
in
the
greek
camp
at
aulis
agamemnon
calls
an
old
slave
outside
his
tent
and
gives
him
secretly
a
letter
to
carry
to
clytemnestra
she
is
at
home
and
has
been
directed
in
previous
letters
to
send
her
daughter
iphigenîa
to
aulis
to
be
wedded
to
achilles
this
letter
simply
bids
her
not
send
the
the
old
slave
is
bewildered
what
does
it
mean
it
means
that
the
marriage
with
achilles
was
a
blind
achilles
knew
nothing
of
it
it
was
a
plot
to
get
iphigenîa
to
the
camp
and
there
slaughter
her
as
a
sacrifice
for
the
safe
passage
of
the
fleet
so
calchas
the
priest
had
commanded
and
he
was
backed
by
odysseus
and
menelaus
agamemnon
had
been
forced
into
compliance
and
is
now
resolved
to
go
back
upon
his
word
the
old
slave
goes
presently
comes
the
entrance
of
the
chorus
women
of
aulis
who
are
dazzled
and
thrilled
by
the
spectacle
of
the
great
army
and
the
men
who
are
prepared
to
die
overseas
for
the
honour
of
hellas
but
we
hear
a
scuffle
outside
and
the
old
slave
returns
pursued
by
menelaus
who
seizes
the
letter
he
calls
for
help
agamemnon
comes
out
and
commands
menelaus
to
give
the
letter
back
a
violent
scene
ensues
between
the
brothers
each
telling
the
other
home
truths
menelaus
besotted
love
for
his
false
wife
his
reckless
selfishness
and
cruelty
consuming
ambition
his
falseness
and
weakness
his
wish
to
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
are
all
laid
bare
in
a
masterly
quarrel
scene
at
last
agamemnon
flatly
refuses
to
give
his
daughter
let
the
army
break
up
let
menelaus
go
without
his
accursed
wife
and
the
barbarians
laugh
as
loudly
as
they
will
agamemnon
will
not
have
his
child
slain
and
his
own
heart
broken
to
please
any
one
is
that
so
says
menelaus
then
i
go
straight
to
he
is
interrupted
by
a
messenger
who
announces
that
iphigenîa
has
come
and
her
mother
clytemnestra
is
with
her
agamemnon
sends
them
a
formal
message
of
welcome
dismisses
the
messenger
and
then
bursts
into
tears
this
shakes
menelaus
he
hesitates
then
abruptly
says
i
can
not
force
you
save
the
girl
as
best
you
can
but
now
it
is
too
late
the
army
knows
that
the
queen
has
come
calchas
and
odysseus
know
agamemnon
has
lost
the
power
of
action
the
next
scene
is
between
the
mother
father
and
daughter
clytemnestra
full
of
questions
about
the
marriage
iphigenîa
full
of
excitement
and
shy
tenderness
which
expresses
itself
in
special
affectionateness
towards
her
father
he
tries
to
persuade
clytemnestra
to
go
home
and
leave
the
child
with
him
she
is
perplexed
and
flatly
refuses
to
go
the
next
scene
is
close
to
comedy
though
comedy
of
a
poignant
kind
achilles
knowing
naught
of
all
these
plots
and
comes
to
tell
the
general
that
his
men
the
myrmidons
are
impatient
and
want
to
sail
for
troy
at
once
at
the
door
of
the
tent
he
meets
clytemnestra
who
greets
him
with
effusive
pleasure
and
speaks
of
the
marriage
that
is
about
to
unite
them
the
young
soldier
is
shy
horrified
anxious
to
run
away
from
this
strange
lady
who
is
so
more
than
friendly
when
suddenly
a
whisper
through
the
door
startles
them
is
the
coast
clear
yes
then
the
whisperer
will
come
it
is
the
old
slave
who
can
bear
it
no
more
but
reveals
the
whole
horrible
plot
iphigenîa
is
to
be
slaughtered
by
the
priests
the
marriage
with
achilles
was
a
bait
for
deceiving
clytemnestra
is
thunderstruck
achilles
furious
with
rage
he
is
dishonoured
he
is
made
a
fool
of
what
sort
of
man
do
they
take
him
for
to
use
his
name
thus
without
his
authority
why
could
not
they
ask
his
consent
they
could
sacrifice
a
dozen
girls
for
all
he
cares
and
he
would
not
have
stood
in
the
way
but
now
they
have
dishonoured
him
and
he
will
forbid
the
sacrifice
clytemnestra
who
has
watched
like
a
drowning
woman
to
see
which
way
the
youth
fierce
vanity
would
leap
throws
herself
at
his
feet
in
gratitude
shall
her
daughter
also
come
and
embrace
his
knees
no
achilles
does
not
want
any
woman
to
kneel
to
him
let
the
women
try
to
change
agamemnon
mind
if
they
can
do
it
all
is
well
if
not
achilles
will
fight
to
the
last
to
save
the
girl
there
follows
the
inevitable
scene
in
which
mother
and
daughter
the
latter
inarticulate
with
tears
convict
the
father
and
appeal
to
him
a
fine
scene
it
is
in
which
each
character
comes
out
clear
and
through
the
still
young
and
obedient
clytemnestra
one
descries
the
shadow
of
the
great
murderess
to
be
agamemnon
is
broken
but
helpless
it
is
too
late
to
go
back
the
two
women
are
left
weeping
at
the
door
of
the
tent
when
they
hear
a
sound
of
tumult
it
is
achilles
and
men
behind
stoning
him
first
thought
is
to
fly
she
dare
not
look
achilles
in
the
face
yet
she
stays
achilles
enters
the
whole
truth
has
come
out
the
army
clamours
for
the
sacrifice
and
is
furious
against
him
will
not
his
own
splendid
myrmidons
protect
him
it
is
they
who
were
the
first
to
stone
him
nevertheless
he
will
fight
he
has
his
arms
clytemnestra
must
fight
too
cling
to
her
daughter
by
main
force
when
they
come
as
they
presently
will
to
drag
her
to
the
altar
stay
says
iphigenîa
achilles
must
not
die
for
her
sake
what
is
her
miserable
life
compared
with
his
one
man
who
can
fight
for
hellas
is
worth
ten
thousand
women
who
can
do
nothing
besides
she
has
been
thinking
it
over
she
has
seen
the
great
gathered
army
ready
to
fight
and
die
for
a
cause
and
like
the
chorus
has
fallen
under
the
spell
of
it
she
realizes
that
it
lies
with
her
a
weak
girl
to
help
them
to
victory
all
great
hellas
is
looking
to
her
and
she
is
proud
and
glad
to
give
her
life
for
hellas
it
is
a
beautiful
and
simple
speech
and
the
pride
of
achilles
withers
up
before
it
in
a
new
tone
he
answers
god
would
indeed
have
made
him
blessed
if
he
had
won
her
for
his
wife
as
it
is
iphigenîa
is
right
yet
he
offers
still
to
fight
for
her
and
save
her
she
does
not
know
what
death
is
and
he
loves
she
answers
that
her
mind
is
made
up
do
not
die
for
me
but
leave
me
to
save
hellas
if
i
can
achilles
yields
still
he
will
go
and
stand
beside
the
altar
armed
if
at
the
last
moment
she
calls
to
him
he
is
ready
so
he
goes
the
mother
and
daughter
bid
one
another
a
last
farewell
and
with
a
song
of
triumph
iphigenîa
escorted
by
her
maidens
goes
forth
to
meet
the
slaughterers
here
the
authentic
part
of
our
play
begins
to
give
out
there
are
fragments
of
a
messenger
speech
afterwards
and
it
is
likely
on
the
whole
that
artemis
saved
the
victim
as
is
assumed
in
the
other
play
the
in
in
spite
of
its
good
plot
is
not
really
one
of
euripides
finest
works
yet
if
nothing
else
of
his
were
preserved
it
would
be
enough
to
mark
him
out
as
a
tremendous
power
in
the
development
of
greek
literature
readers
who
enjoy
drama
but
have
never
quite
accustomed
themselves
to
the
stately
conventions
of
fifth
century
tragedy
very
often
like
it
better
than
any
other
greek
play
it
is
curiously
different
from
its
twin
sister
the
a
reader
of
the
who
looks
back
at
the
ritual
sequence
described
above
will
be
startled
to
find
how
close
this
drama
apparently
so
wild
and
imaginative
has
kept
to
the
ancient
rite
the
regular
is
just
clothed
in
sufficient
myth
to
make
it
a
story
the
daemon
must
have
his
enemy
who
is
like
himself
then
we
must
have
the
contest
the
tearing
asunder
the
messenger
the
lamentation
mixed
with
the
discovery
of
the
scattered
members
and
by
a
sort
of
doubling
the
discovery
of
the
true
god
and
the
epiphany
of
the
daemon
in
glory
all
are
there
in
the
the
god
dionysus
accompanied
by
his
wild
women
comes
to
his
own
land
and
is
rejected
by
his
kinsman
king
pentheus
and
by
the
women
of
the
royal
house
the
god
sends
his
divine
madness
on
the
women
the
wise
elders
of
the
tribe
warn
the
king
but
pentheus
first
binds
and
imprisons
the
god
then
yielding
gradually
to
the
divine
power
agrees
to
go
disguised
in
woman
garb
to
watch
the
secret
worship
of
the
maenads
on
mt
kithairon
he
goes
is
discovered
by
the
maenads
and
torn
in
fragments
his
mother
agave
returns
in
triumph
dancing
with
her
son
head
which
in
her
madness
she
takes
for
a
lion
there
is
lamentation
mixed
with
mad
rejoicing
the
scattered
body
is
recovered
agave
is
restored
to
her
right
mind
and
to
misery
the
god
appears
in
majesty
and
pronounces
doom
on
all
who
have
rejected
him
the
mortals
go
forth
to
their
dooms
still
faithful
still
loving
one
another
the
ghastly
and
triumphant
god
ascends
into
heaven
the
whole
scheme
of
the
play
is
given
by
the
ancient
ritual
it
is
the
original
subject
of
attic
tragedy
treated
once
more
as
doubtless
it
had
already
been
treated
by
all
or
almost
all
the
other
tragedians
but
we
can
go
further
we
have
enough
fragments
and
quotations
from
the
aeschylean
plays
on
this
subject
especially
the
lycurgus
trilogy
to
see
that
all
kinds
of
small
details
which
seemed
like
invention
and
rather
fantastic
invention
on
the
part
of
euripides
are
taken
straight
from
aeschylus
or
the
ritual
or
both
the
timbrels
the
fawnskin
the
ivy
the
sacred
pine
the
god
taking
the
forms
of
bull
and
lion
and
snake
the
dances
on
the
mountain
at
dawn
the
old
men
who
are
by
the
power
of
the
god
made
young
again
the
god
represented
as
beardless
and
like
a
woman
the
god
imprisoned
and
escaping
the
earthquake
that
wrecks
pentheus
palace
the
victim
pentheus
disguised
as
a
woman
all
these
and
more
can
be
shown
to
be
in
the
ritual
and
nearly
all
are
in
the
extant
fragments
of
aeschylus
even
variants
of
the
story
which
have
been
used
by
previous
poets
have
somehow
a
place
found
for
them
there
was
for
instance
a
variant
which
made
pentheus
lead
an
army
against
the
wild
women
in
the
this
plan
is
not
used
but
pentheus
is
made
to
think
of
it
and
say
he
will
perhaps
follow
it
and
dionysus
is
made
to
say
what
will
happen
if
he
does
ff
there
never
was
a
great
play
so
steeped
in
tradition
as
the
the
was
all
invention
construction
brilliant
psychology
it
was
a
play
of
new
plot
and
new
characters
the
takes
an
old
fixed
plot
and
fixed
formal
characters
dionysus
pentheus
cadmus
teiresias
they
are
characters
that
hardly
need
proper
names
one
might
just
as
well
call
them
the
god
the
young
king
the
old
king
the
prophet
and
as
for
agave
our
mss
do
as
a
rule
simply
call
her
woman
the
is
full
of
informalities
broken
metres
interruptions
its
chorus
hardly
matters
to
the
plot
and
has
little
to
sing
the
is
the
most
formal
greek
play
known
to
us
its
chorus
is
its
very
soul
and
its
lyric
songs
are
as
long
as
they
are
magnificent
for
the
curious
thing
is
that
in
this
extreme
of
formality
and
faithfulness
to
archaic
tradition
euripides
has
found
both
his
greatest
originality
and
his
most
perfect
freedom
he
is
an
old
story
but
he
is
not
merely
doing
that
in
the
almost
every
reader
feels
that
there
is
something
more
than
a
story
there
is
a
meaning
or
there
is
at
least
a
riddle
and
we
must
try
in
some
degree
to
understand
it
now
in
order
to
keep
our
heads
cool
it
is
first
necessary
to
remember
clearly
two
things
the
is
not
free
invention
it
is
tradition
and
it
is
not
free
personal
expression
it
is
drama
the
poet
can
not
simply
and
without
a
veil
state
his
own
views
he
can
only
let
his
own
personality
shine
through
the
dim
curtain
in
front
of
which
his
puppets
act
their
traditional
parts
and
utter
their
appropriate
sentiments
thus
it
is
doubly
elusive
and
therein
no
doubt
lay
its
charm
to
the
poet
he
had
a
vehicle
into
which
he
could
pour
many
of
those
vaguer
faiths
and
aspirations
which
a
man
feels
haunting
him
and
calling
to
him
but
which
he
can
not
state
in
plain
language
or
uphold
with
a
full
acceptance
of
responsibility
but
our
difficulties
are
even
greater
than
this
the
personal
meaning
of
a
drama
of
this
sort
is
not
only
elusive
it
is
almost
certain
to
be
inconsistent
with
itself
or
at
least
incomplete
for
one
only
feels
its
presence
strongly
when
in
some
way
it
clashes
with
the
smooth
flow
of
the
story
let
us
imagine
a
great
modern
poet
say
swinburne
or
morris
or
victor
hugo
all
of
whom
did
such
things
making
for
some
local
anniversary
a
rhymed
play
in
the
style
of
the
old
mysteries
on
some
legend
of
a
mediaeval
saint
the
saint
let
us
suppose
is
very
meek
and
is
cruelly
persecuted
by
a
wicked
emperor
whom
he
threatens
with
hell
fire
and
at
the
end
let
us
have
the
emperor
in
the
midst
of
that
fire
and
the
saint
in
glory
saying
what
did
i
tell
you
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
play
in
its
course
gives
splendid
opportunities
for
solemn
latin
hymns
such
as
swinburne
and
hugo
delighted
in
we
should
probably
have
a
result
something
like
the
for
one
thing
in
such
a
play
one
would
not
be
troubled
by
little
flaws
and
anachronisms
and
inconsistencies
one
would
not
be
shocked
to
hear
thomas
speaking
about
charlemagne
or
to
find
the
mouth
of
hell
situated
in
the
same
street
as
the
emperor
lodging
just
so
we
need
not
be
shocked
in
the
to
find
that
though
the
god
is
supposed
to
be
appearing
for
the
first
time
in
thebes
his
followers
appeal
to
immemorial
custom
as
the
chief
ground
for
their
worship
cf
fr
nor
to
observe
that
the
chorus
habitually
makes
loud
professions
of
faith
under
the
very
nose
of
the
tyrant
without
his
ever
attending
to
them
nor
even
that
the
traditional
earthquake
which
destroys
the
palace
causes
a
good
deal
of
trouble
in
the
thinking
out
it
had
to
be
there
it
was
an
integral
part
of
the
story
in
aeschylus
fr
and
in
all
probability
before
him
one
may
suppose
that
the
greek
stage
carpenter
was
capable
of
some
symbolic
crash
which
served
its
purpose
the
language
used
is
carefully
indefinite
it
suggests
that
the
whole
palace
is
destroyed
but
leaves
a
spectator
free
if
he
so
chooses
to
suppose
that
it
is
only
the
actual
prison
of
dionysus
which
is
and
unseen
in
any
case
the
ruins
are
not
allowed
to
litter
the
stage
and
once
over
the
earthquake
is
never
noticed
or
mentioned
again
again
such
a
play
would
involve
a
bewildering
shift
of
sympathy
just
as
the
does
at
first
we
should
be
all
for
the
saint
and
against
the
tyrant
the
persecuted
monks
with
their
hymns
of
faith
and
endurance
would
stir
our
souls
then
when
the
tables
were
turned
and
the
oppressors
were
seen
writhing
in
hell
we
should
feel
that
at
their
worst
they
did
not
quite
deserve
that
we
should
even
begin
to
surmise
that
perhaps
with
all
their
faults
they
were
not
really
as
horrible
as
the
saint
himself
and
reflect
inwardly
what
a
barbarous
thing
after
all
this
mediaeval
religion
was
this
bewildering
shift
of
sympathy
is
common
in
euripides
we
have
had
it
before
in
such
plays
as
the
and
oppression
generates
revenge
and
the
revenge
becomes
more
horrible
than
the
original
oppression
in
these
plays
the
poet
offers
no
solution
he
gives
us
only
the
bitterness
of
life
and
the
unspoken
tears
that
are
in
things
the
first
serious
attempt
at
a
solution
comes
in
the
and
in
a
such
as
we
have
imagined
by
a
great
modern
poet
the
interest
and
meaning
would
hardly
lie
in
the
main
plot
they
would
lie
in
something
which
the
poet
himself
contributed
we
might
for
instance
find
that
he
had
poured
all
his
soul
into
the
latin
hymns
or
into
the
spectacle
of
the
saint
alone
and
unterrified
defying
all
the
threats
and
all
the
temptations
which
the
emperor
can
bring
to
bear
upon
him
there
might
thus
be
a
glorification
of
that
mystic
rejection
of
the
world
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
mediaeval
monasticism
without
the
poet
for
a
moment
committing
himself
to
a
belief
in
monasticism
or
an
acceptance
of
the
catholic
church
we
have
in
the
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
deny
it
a
heartfelt
glorification
of
dionysus
no
doubt
it
is
dionysus
in
some
private
sense
of
the
poet
own
something
opposed
to
the
world
some
spirit
of
the
wild
woods
and
the
sunrise
of
inspiration
and
untrammelled
life
the
presentation
is
not
consistent
however
magical
the
poetry
at
one
moment
we
have
the
bacchantes
raving
for
revenge
at
the
next
they
are
uttering
the
dreams
of
some
gentle
and
musing
philosopher
a
deliberate
contrast
seems
to
be
made
in
each
chorus
between
the
strophe
and
the
antistrophe
it
is
not
consistent
though
it
is
likely
enough
that
if
one
had
taxed
euripides
with
the
contradiction
he
might
have
had
some
answer
that
would
surprise
us
his
first
defence
of
course
would
be
a
simple
one
it
is
not
the
playwright
business
to
have
any
views
at
all
he
is
only
a
traditional
story
and
trying
to
tell
it
right
but
he
might
also
venture
outside
his
defences
and
answer
more
frankly
this
spirit
that
i
call
dionysus
this
magic
of
inspiration
and
joy
is
it
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
great
wrecker
of
men
lives
while
life
seems
a
decent
grey
to
you
all
over
you
are
safe
and
likely
to
be
prosperous
when
you
feel
the
heavens
opening
you
may
begin
to
tremble
for
the
vision
you
see
there
as
it
is
the
most
beautiful
of
things
is
likely
also
to
be
the
most
destructive
for
the
poet
himself
indeed
the
only
course
is
to
pursue
it
across
the
world
to
the
cold
mountain
tops
ff
for
there
is
grace
and
there
is
the
heart
desire
and
peace
to
adore
thee
thou
spirit
of
guiding
fire
he
will
clasp
it
even
though
it
slay
him
the
old
critics
used
to
assume
that
the
marked
a
sort
of
repentance
the
veteran
of
thought
the
man
who
had
consistently
denounced
and
ridiculed
all
the
foul
old
stories
of
mythology
now
saw
the
error
of
his
ways
and
was
returning
to
orthodoxy
such
a
view
strikes
us
now
as
almost
childish
in
its
incompetence
yet
there
is
i
think
a
gleam
of
muddled
truth
somewhere
behind
it
there
was
no
repentance
there
was
no
return
to
orthodoxy
nor
indeed
was
there
in
the
strict
sense
any
such
thing
as
orthodoxy
to
return
to
for
greek
religion
had
no
creeds
but
there
is
i
think
a
rather
different
attitude
towards
the
pieties
of
the
common
man
it
is
well
to
remember
that
for
all
his
lucidity
of
language
euripides
is
not
lucid
about
religion
his
general
spirit
is
clear
it
is
a
spirit
of
liberation
of
moral
revolt
of
much
denial
but
it
is
also
a
spirit
of
search
and
wonder
and
surmise
he
was
not
in
any
sense
a
mere
rationalist
we
find
in
his
plays
the
rule
of
divine
justice
often
asserted
sometimes
passionately
denied
and
one
tragedy
the
is
based
on
the
denial
it
is
in
a
fragment
of
this
play
that
we
have
the
outcry
of
some
sufferer
doth
any
feign
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
there
is
none
none
and
afterwards
the
hero
staggered
by
the
injustice
of
things
questions
zeus
himself
and
is
for
answer
blasted
by
the
thunderbolt
a
clearer
form
of
this
same
question
and
one
which
vexed
the
age
a
good
deal
was
to
ask
whether
or
no
the
world
is
governed
by
some
great
intelligence
or
understanding
or
more
crudely
whether
the
gods
are
euripides
at
times
hath
deep
in
his
hope
a
belief
in
some
understanding
and
is
represented
in
the
as
actually
praying
to
it
by
that
name
but
he
sometimes
finds
the
facts
against
him
compared
with
the
sequel
of
the
play
the
question
between
polytheism
and
monotheism
which
has
loomed
so
large
to
some
minds
never
troubled
him
he
uses
the
singular
and
plural
quite
indifferently
and
probably
his
gods
when
used
as
identical
with
god
or
the
divine
would
hardly
even
suggest
to
him
the
gods
of
mythology
if
one
is
to
venture
a
conjecture
his
own
feeling
may
perhaps
be
expressed
by
a
line
in
the
we
are
slaves
of
gods
whatever
gods
may
be
that
is
there
are
unknown
forces
which
shape
or
destroy
man
life
and
which
may
be
conceived
as
in
some
sense
personal
but
morally
it
would
seem
these
forces
are
not
better
but
less
good
than
man
who
at
least
loves
and
pities
and
tries
to
understand
such
is
the
impression
i
think
left
on
readers
of
the
the
or
the
but
there
is
one
thought
which
often
recurs
in
euripides
in
plays
of
all
periods
and
is
specially
thrown
in
his
teeth
by
aristophanes
that
satirist
when
piling
up
euripides
theatrical
iniquities
takes
as
his
comic
climax
women
who
say
life
is
not
life
the
reference
is
to
passages
like
fr
from
the
who
knoweth
if
the
thing
that
we
call
death
be
life
and
our
life
dying
who
knoweth
save
only
that
all
we
beneath
the
sun
are
sick
and
suffering
and
those
foregone
not
sick
nor
touched
with
evil
any
more
fr
also
the
idea
recurs
again
and
again
as
also
does
the
thought
that
death
is
some
other
shape
of
life
in
the
and
even
in
the
nay
more
death
may
be
the
state
that
we
unconsciously
long
for
and
that
really
fulfils
our
inmost
desires
there
is
no
rest
on
this
earth
says
a
speaker
in
the
and
whatever
state
there
be
dearer
than
life
to
mortality
the
hand
of
the
dark
hath
hold
thereof
and
mist
is
under
and
mist
above
and
thus
she
continues
we
cling
to
this
strange
thing
that
shines
in
the
sunlight
and
are
sick
with
love
for
it
because
we
have
not
seen
beyond
the
veil
a
stirring
thought
this
and
much
nearer
to
the
heart
of
mysticism
than
any
mere
assertion
of
human
immortality
thus
it
is
not
from
any
position
like
what
we
should
call
dogmatic
atheism
or
scientific
materialism
that
the
child
of
the
sophists
started
his
attacks
on
the
current
mythology
the
sophists
themselves
had
no
orthodoxy
euripides
was
always
a
rejecter
of
the
laws
of
the
herd
he
was
in
protest
against
its
moral
standards
its
superstitions
and
follies
its
social
injustices
in
protest
also
against
its
worldliness
and
its
indifference
to
those
things
which
both
as
a
poet
and
a
philosopher
he
felt
to
be
highest
and
such
he
remained
throughout
his
life
but
in
his
later
years
the
direction
of
his
protest
did
i
think
somewhat
change
in
the
athens
of
melos
and
the
sicilian
expedition
there
was
something
that
roused
his
aversion
far
more
than
did
the
mere
ignorance
of
a
stupid
greek
farmer
it
was
a
deeper
a
more
unteachable
brutality
the
men
who
spoke
in
the
melian
dialogue
were
full
of
what
they
considered
sophia
it
is
likely
enough
that
they
conformed
carefully
to
the
popular
religious
prejudices
such
politicians
always
do
but
in
practice
they
thought
as
little
of
the
gods
as
the
most
pronounced
sceptic
could
wish
they
had
quite
rejected
such
unprofitable
ideals
as
pity
and
charm
of
words
and
the
generosity
of
strength
to
which
the
simple
man
of
the
old
times
had
always
had
the
door
of
his
heart
open
they
were
haunters
of
the
mockers
at
all
simplicity
close
pursuers
of
gain
and
revenge
rejecters
the
poet
might
feel
in
his
bitterness
both
of
beauty
and
of
god
and
the
herd
as
represented
by
athens
followed
them
like
other
ideal
democrats
he
turned
away
from
the
actual
demos
which
surrounded
him
and
howled
him
down
to
a
demos
of
his
imagination
pure
and
uncorrupted
in
which
the
heart
of
the
natural
man
should
speak
his
later
plays
break
out
more
than
once
into
praises
of
the
unspoiled
countryman
neither
rich
nor
poor
who
works
with
his
own
arm
and
whose
home
is
the
solemn
mountain
not
the
city
streets
especially
as
contrasted
with
ff
also
the
peasant
in
the
also
in
the
we
have
not
only
several
denunciations
not
at
all
relevant
to
the
main
plot
of
those
whom
the
world
calls
wise
we
have
the
wonderful
chorus
about
the
fawn
escaped
from
the
hunters
rejoicing
in
the
green
and
lonely
places
where
no
pursuing
voice
is
heard
and
the
little
things
of
the
woodland
live
unseen
ff
that
is
the
poetry
of
this
emotion
the
prose
of
it
comes
in
a
sudden
cry
the
simple
nameless
herd
of
humanity
have
deeds
and
faith
that
are
truth
enough
for
me
though
even
that
prose
has
followed
immediately
on
the
more
mystical
doctrine
that
man
must
love
the
day
and
the
night
and
that
dionysus
has
poured
the
mystic
wine
that
is
himself
for
all
things
that
live
in
another
passage
which
i
translate
literally
he
seems
to
make
his
exact
position
more
clear
as
for
knowledge
i
bear
her
no
grudge
i
take
joy
in
the
pursuit
of
her
but
the
other
things
the
other
elements
of
existence
are
great
and
shining
oh
for
life
to
flow
towards
that
which
is
beautiful
till
man
through
both
light
and
darkness
should
be
at
peace
and
reverent
and
casting
from
him
laws
that
are
outside
justice
give
glory
to
the
gods
those
laws
which
are
outside
justice
would
make
trouble
enough
between
euripides
and
the
simple
herd
if
ever
they
reached
the
point
of
discussing
them
he
who
most
loves
the
ideal
natural
man
seldom
agrees
with
the
majority
of
his
neighbours
but
for
the
meantime
the
poet
is
wrapped
up
in
another
war
in
which
he
and
religion
and
nature
and
the
life
of
the
simple
man
seem
to
be
standing
on
one
side
against
a
universal
enemy
i
am
not
attempting
to
expound
the
whole
meaning
of
the
i
am
only
suggesting
a
clue
by
which
to
follow
it
like
a
live
thing
it
seems
to
move
and
show
new
faces
every
time
that
with
imagination
fully
working
one
reads
the
play
there
were
many
factors
at
work
doubtless
to
produce
the
the
peculiar
state
of
athens
the
poet
ecstasy
of
escape
from
an
intolerable
atmosphere
the
simple
homeric
life
in
macedonian
forests
and
mountains
and
perhaps
even
the
sight
of
real
bacchantes
dancing
there
but
it
may
be
that
the
chief
factor
is
simply
this
when
a
man
is
fairly
confronted
with
death
and
is
consciously
doing
his
last
work
in
the
world
the
chances
are
that
if
his
brain
is
clear
and
unterrified
the
deepest
part
of
his
nature
will
assert
itself
euripides
was
both
a
reasoner
and
a
poet
the
two
sides
of
his
nature
sometimes
clashed
and
sometimes
blended
but
ever
since
the
he
had
known
which
service
he
really
lived
for
and
in
his
last
work
it
is
the
poet
who
speaks
and
reveals
so
far
as
such
a
thing
can
be
revealed
the
secret
religion
of
poetry
footnote

my
verse
translation
i
took
a
slightly
different
reading

then
misinformed
about

the
general
sense

the
same
knowledge

are

chapter

the

of
euripides
ideal
form
and
sincere
spirit
prologue
messenger
deus
ex
mâchinâ
euripides
was
so
much
besides
a
poet
that
we
sometimes
tend
to
regard
him
exclusively
as
a
great
thinker
or
a
great
personality
and
forget
that
it
is
in
his
poetry
that
he
lives
a
biography
like
that
which
we
have
attempted
to
sketch
is
of
little
value
except
as
a
kind
of
clue
to
guide
a
reader
through
the
paths
of
the
poet
own
work
it
is
only
by
reading
his
plays
that
we
can
know
him
and
unfortunately
owing
to
the
two
thousand
odd
years
that
have
passed
since
his
death
we
must
needs
approach
them
through
some
distorting
medium
we
read
them
either
in
a
foreign
language
as
a
rule
most
imperfectly
understood
or
else
in
a
translation
it
is
hard
to
say
by
which
method
a
reader
who
is
not
a
quite
good
greek
scholar
will
miss
most
a
further
difficulty
occurs
about
the
translations
i
need
not
perhaps
apologize
for
assuming
normally
in
the
present
volume
the
use
of
my
own
there
has
been
lately
since
the
work
of
verrall
in
england
and
wilamowitz
in
germany
a
far
more
successful
effort
made
to
understand
the
mind
of
euripides
while
the
recent
performances
of
his
plays
in
london
and
elsewhere
have
considerably
increased
our
insight
into
his
stagecraft
consequently
we
can
now
see
that
the
older
translations
even
when
verbally
defensible
and
even
skilful
are
often
seriously
inadequate
or
misleading
a
comparison
of
verrall
english
version
of
the
with
practically
any
of
its
predecessors
will
illustrate
this
point
the
greatest
change
that
has
come
over
our
study
of
greek
civilization
and
literature
in
the
last
two
generations
is
this
that
we
now
try
to
approach
it
historically
as
a
thing
that
moves
and
grows
and
has
its
place
in
the
whole
of
man
the
old
view
sometimes
called
classicist
was
to
regard
the
great
classical
books
as
eternal
models
their
style
was
simply
the
right
style
and
all
the
variations
observable
in
modern
literature
were
in
one
degree
or
another
so
many
concessions
to
the
weakness
of
human
nature
there
is
in
this
view
an
element
of
truth
the
fundamental
ideals
which
have
produced
results
so
singularly
and
so
permanently
successful
can
not
be
lightly
disregarded
books
that
are
still
read
with
delight
after
two
thousand
years
are
certainly
in
some
sense
models
to
imitate
but
the
great
flaw
in
the
classicist
view
as
regards
the
ancient
literature
itself
was
that
it
concentrated
attention
on
the
external
and
accidental
on
the
mannerism
not
the
meaning
on
the
temporary
fashion
of
a
great
age
not
on
the
spirit
which
made
that
age
great
a
historical
mind
will
always
try
by
active
and
critical
use
of
the
imagination
to
see
the
greek
poet
or
philosopher
in
his
real
surroundings
and
against
his
proper
background
seen
thus
he
will
appear
not
as
a
stationary
ancient
contrasted
with
a
modern
but
as
a
moving
and
striving
figure
a
daring
pioneer
in
the
advance
of
the
human
spirit
to
failure
because
his
aims
were
so
far
greater
than
his
material
resources
his
habit
of
mind
so
far
in
advance
of
the
world
that
surrounded
him
we
seem
in
ancient
greece
to
be
moving
in
a
region
that
is
next
door
to
savagery
and
in
the
midst
of
it
to
have
speech
with
men
whom
we
might
gladly
accept
as
our
leaders
or
advisers
if
they
lived
now
meantime
there
are
screens
between
us
and
these
men
the
screens
of
a
foreign
language
a
strange
form
of
life
different
conventions
in
art
it
is
these
last
that
we
must
now
deal
with
for
we
shall
find
it
hard
ever
to
understand
greek
tragedy
if
we
expect
from
it
exactly
what
we
expect
from
a
modern
or
elizabethan
play
one
would
have
to
make
no
such
preface
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
form
of
greek
drama
that
immediately
succeeded
the
great
age
of
tragedy
there
arose
in
the
fourth
century
a
kind
of
play
that
we
could
understand
at
once
the
new
comedy
of
menander
and
philemon
new
comedy
is
neither
tragic
nor
comic
but
like
our
own
plays
a
discreet
mixture
of
both
it
has
no
austere
religious
atmosphere
its
interest
like
ours
is
in
love
and
adventure
and
intrigue
it
has
turned
aside
from
legend
and
legendary
kings
and
queens
and
operates
as
we
do
with
a
boldly
invented
plot
and
fictitious
characters
drawn
mostly
from
everyday
life
the
new
comedy
dominated
the
later
attic
stage
and
called
into
life
the
roman
it
was
highly
praised
and
immensely
popular
it
was
so
easy
in
its
flow
and
it
demanded
so
little
effort
yet
significantly
enough
it
has
passed
away
without
leaving
a
single
complete
specimen
of
its
work
in
existence
when
after
ages
were
exerting
themselves
to
save
from
antiquity
just
that
minimum
of
most
precious
things
that
must
not
be
allowed
to
die
it
was
the
greater
and
more
difficult
form
of
drama
that
they
preserved
let
us
try
to
see
and
to
surmount
the
difficulties
every
form
of
art
has
its
conventions
think
for
instance
of
the
conventions
of
modern
opera
looked
at
in
cold
blood
from
outside
the
illusion
few
forms
of
art
could
be
more
absurd
yet
i
suppose
the
emotional
and
artistic
effect
of
a
great
opera
is
extraordinarily
high
the
analogy
may
help
us
in
the
understanding
of
greek
tragedy
let
us
remember
that
it
is
at
heart
a
religious
ritual
we
shall
then
understand
so
far
as
it
is
necessary
for
a
modern
reader
to
think
of
such
things
the
ceremonial
dress
the
religious
masks
the
constant
presence
or
nearness
of
the
supernatural
we
shall
understand
perhaps
also
the
formal
dignity
of
language
and
action
it
is
verse
and
like
all
greek
verse
unrhymed
but
it
is
not
at
all
like
the
loose
elizabethan
verse
which
fluctuates
from
scene
to
scene
and
makes
up
for
its
lack
of
strict
form
by
extreme
verbal
ornamentation
in
greek
tragic
dialogue
the
metrical
form
is
stiff
and
clear
hardly
ever
could
a
tragic
line
by
any
mistake
be
taken
for
prose
the
only
normal
variation
is
not
towards
prose
but
towards
a
still
more
highly
wrought
musical
lyric
yet
inside
the
stiff
metrical
form
the
language
is
clear
simple
and
direct
a
similar
effect
can
in
my
opinion
only
be
attained
in
english
by
the
use
of
rhyme
you
must
somehow
feel
always
that
you
are
in
the
realm
of
verse
yet
your
language
must
always
be
simple
in
blank
verse
the
language
has
to
be
tortured
a
little
or
it
will
read
like
prose
now
all
this
sounds
highly
conventional
that
it
is
and
artificial
and
unreal
that
it
is
not
we
are
apt
at
the
present
moment
of
taste
to
associate
together
two
things
that
have
no
real
connexion
with
one
another
sincerity
of
thought
and
sloppiness
of
form
take
on
the
one
hand
dramatic
poems
like
swinburne
written
all
in
rhymed
verse
and
partly
in
sonnets
or
george
meredith
which
is
all
in
a
form
of
sonnet
these
are
works
of
the
most
artistic
convention
their
form
is
both
severe
and
elaborate
in
that
lies
half
their
beauty
but
the
other
half
lies
in
their
sincerity
and
delicacy
of
thought
and
their
intensity
of
feeling
they
are
sincere
but
not
formless
of
the
other
extreme
which
is
formless
without
being
sincere
i
need
give
no
examples
the
reader
can
think
of
the
novel
he
knows
and
it
will
probably
satisfy
the
conditions
in
greek
tragedy
we
have
the
element
of
formal
convention
extremely
strong
we
have
also
great
subtlety
and
sincerity
this
quality
of
sincerity
is
perhaps
the
very
first
thing
that
should
be
pointed
out
to
a
reader
who
is
beginning
greek
tragedy
coming
in
the
midst
of
so
much
poetical
convention
it
takes
a
modern
reader
by
surprise
he
expected
romantic
idealism
and
he
finds
clear
i
once
read
a
critic
who
argued
that
euripides
had
low
ideals
of
womanhood
because
in
the
critic
carefully
pondered
judgment
medea
was
not
a
perfect
wife
even
coleridge
complained
that
the
greek
tragedians
could
not
make
a
heroine
interesting
without
her
such
criticisms
imply
a
conception
of
drama
in
which
the
women
are
conventionally
seen
through
a
roseate
mist
of
amatory
emotion
we
mean
to
be
in
love
with
the
heroine
and
in
order
that
she
may
be
worthy
of
that
honour
the
author
must
endow
her
with
all
the
adorable
attributes
the
men
in
such
plays
suffer
much
less
from
beautification
but
even
they
suffer
this
spurious
kind
of
romanticism
implies
chiefly
an
indifference
to
truth
in
the
realm
of
character
it
is
generally
accompanied
by
an
indifference
to
truth
in
other
respects
it
leads
to
look
out
for
the
effect
not
the
truth
to
write
with
a
view
to
exciting
the
audience
instead
of
expressing
something
which
they
have
to
express
it
leads
in
fact
to
all
the
forms
of
staginess
now
from
greek
tragedy
this
kind
of
falseness
is
almost
entirely
absent
it
has
no
utter
villains
no
insipidly
angelic
heroines
even
its
tyrants
generally
have
some
touch
of
human
nature
about
them
they
have
at
least
a
case
to
state
even
its
virgin
martyrs
are
not
waxen
images
the
stories
are
no
doubt
often
miraculous
the
characters
themselves
are
often
in
their
origin
supernatural
but
their
psychology
is
severely
true
it
is
not
the
psychology
of
melodrama
specially
contrived
to
lead
up
to
situations
it
is
that
of
observed
human
nature
and
human
nature
not
merely
observed
but
approached
with
a
serious
almost
reverent
sympathy
and
an
unlimited
desire
to
understand
bernard
shaw
in
his
of
writes
of
a
new
element
brought
into
modern
drama
by
the
norwegian
school
ibsen
was
grim
enough
in
all
conscience
no
man
has
said
more
terrible
things
and
yet
there
is
not
one
of
ibsen
characters
who
is
not
in
the
old
phrase
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
and
who
does
not
move
you
at
moments
by
the
sense
of
that
mystery
allowing
for
the
great
difference
of
treatment
and
the
comparative
absence
of
detail
in
the
ancient
drama
this
phrase
would
i
think
be
true
of
all
the
great
greek
tragedians
in
euripides
it
is
clear
enough
jason
as
well
as
medea
clytemnestra
as
well
as
electra
even
satirized
characters
like
menelaus
in
the
or
agamemnon
in
the
in
are
creatures
of
one
blood
with
ourselves
they
are
beings
who
must
be
understood
who
can
not
be
thrust
beyond
the
pale
and
they
all
move
us
at
moments
by
the
sense
of
that
mystery
but
it
holds
in
general
for
the
other
tragedians
too
for
the
creators
of
creon
and
antigone
of
prometheus
and
zeus
what
poet
until
quite
modern
times
would
have
dared
to
make
an
audience
sympathize
with
clytemnestra
the
adulteress
as
aeschylus
does
who
would
have
dared
like
sophocles
to
make
antigone
speak
cruelly
to
her
devoted
sister
or
electra
with
all
our
sympathies
concentrated
upon
her
behave
like
a
wild
beast
and
be
disgusted
with
herself
for
so
doing
but
what
we
have
now
to
realize
is
that
this
sincerity
of
treatment
takes
place
inside
a
shell
of
stiff
and
elaborate
convention
at
the
very
beginning
of
a
play
by
euripides
we
shall
find
something
that
seems
deliberately
calculated
to
offend
us
and
destroy
our
interest
a
prologue
it
is
a
long
speech
with
no
action
to
speak
of
and
it
tells
us
not
only
the
present
situation
of
the
characters
which
is
rather
dull
but
also
what
is
going
to
happen
to
them
which
seems
to
us
to
spoil
the
rest
of
the
play
and
the
modern
scholastic
critic
says
in
his
heart
euripides
had
no
sense
of
the
stage
now
since
we
know
that
he
had
a
very
great
sense
of
the
stage
and
enormous
experience
also
let
us
try
to
see
what
value
he
found
in
this
strange
prologue
first
no
doubt
it
was
a
convenience
there
were
no
playbills
to
hand
round
with
lists
of
the
also
a
greek
tragedy
is
always
highly
concentrated
it
consists
generally
of
what
would
be
the
fifth
act
of
a
modern
tragedy
and
does
not
spend
its
time
on
explanatory
and
introductory
acts
the
prologue
saved
time
here
but
why
does
it
let
out
the
secret
of
what
is
coming
why
does
it
spoil
the
excitement
beforehand
because
we
must
answer
there
is
no
secret
and
the
poet
does
not
aim
at
that
sort
of
excitement
a
certain
amount
of
there
certainly
is
we
are
never
told
exactly
what
thing
will
happen
but
only
what
sort
of
thing
or
we
are
told
what
will
happen
but
not
how
it
will
happen
but
the
enjoyment
which
the
poet
aims
at
is
not
the
enjoyment
of
reading
a
detective
story
for
the
first
time
it
is
that
of
reading
or
for
the
second
or
fifth
or
tenth
when
hippolytus
or
oedipus
first
appears
on
the
stage
you
know
that
he
is
doomed
that
knowledge
gives
an
increased
significance
to
everything
that
he
says
or
does
you
see
the
shadow
of
disaster
closing
in
behind
him
and
when
the
catastrophe
comes
it
comes
with
the
greater
force
because
you
were
watching
for
it
at
any
rate
the
modern
reader
may
persist
the
prologue
is
rather
dull
it
does
not
arrest
the
attention
like
for
instance
the
opening
scenes
of
or
or
and
no
it
does
not
shakespeare
one
may
suppose
had
a
somewhat
noisy
audience
all
talking
among
themselves
and
not
disposed
to
listen
till
their
attention
was
captured
by
force
the
greek
audience
was
as
far
as
we
can
make
out
sitting
in
a
religious
silence
a
prayer
had
been
offered
and
incense
burnt
on
the
altar
of
dionysus
and
during
such
a
ritual
the
rule
enjoined
silence
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
greek
poet
to
capture
his
audience
by
a
scene
of
bustle
or
excitement
and
this
left
him
free
to
do
two
things
both
eminently
characteristic
of
greek
art
he
could
make
his
atmosphere
and
he
could
build
up
his
drama
from
the
ground
let
us
take
the
question
of
building
first
if
you
study
a
number
of
modern
plays
you
will
probably
find
that
their
main
effects
are
produced
in
very
different
places
though
especially
of
course
at
the
fall
of
each
curtain
a
good
greek
play
moves
almost
always
in
a
curve
of
steadily
increasing
tension
increasing
up
to
the
last
scene
but
one
and
then
as
a
rule
sinking
into
a
note
of
solemn
calm
it
often
admits
a
quiet
scene
about
the
middle
to
let
the
play
take
breath
but
it
is
very
chary
indeed
of
lifting
and
then
dropping
again
and
never
does
so
without
definite
reason
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
euripides
likes
to
have
his
opening
as
as
still
as
slow
in
movement
as
he
can
make
it
its
only
tension
is
a
feeling
of
foreboding
or
of
mystery
it
is
meant
as
a
foundation
to
build
upon
and
every
scene
that
follows
will
be
higher
swifter
more
intense
a
rush
of
excitement
at
the
opening
would
jar
so
to
speak
the
whole
musical
scheme
and
this
quiet
opening
is
especially
used
to
produce
the
right
state
of
mind
in
the
audience
or
as
our
modern
phrase
puts
it
to
give
the
play
its
atmosphere
take
almost
any
opening
the
with
its
band
of
desolate
mothers
kneeling
at
an
altar
and
holding
the
queen
prisoner
while
she
speaks
the
the
the
of
almost
the
same
an
altar
and
helpless
people
kneeling
at
it
kneeling
and
waiting
the
with
its
angry
gods
the
with
its
ruined
city
walls
and
desolate
plain
and
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
polydorus
brooding
over
them
the
with
its
sinister
goddess
potent
and
inexorable
who
vanishes
at
the
note
of
the
hunting
horn
but
is
felt
in
the
background
throughout
the
whole
play
the
with
its
solitary
and
exiled
priestess
waiting
at
the
doors
of
her
strange
temple
of
death
most
of
the
prologues
have
about
them
something
supernatural
all
of
them
something
mysterious
and
all
of
them
are
scenes
of
waiting
not
acting
waiting
till
the
atmosphere
can
slowly
gain
its
full
hold
regarded
from
this
point
of
view
i
think
that
every
opening
scene
in
greek
tragedy
will
be
seen
to
have
its
significance
and
its
value
in
the
whole
scheme
of
the
play
certainly
the
prologue
generally
justifies
itself
in
the
acting
and
when
the
prologue
is
over
and
the
action
begins
we
need
not
expect
even
then
any
rapid
stir
or
bustle
johnson
has
told
us
that
a
man
who
should
read
richardson
for
the
story
might
as
well
hang
himself
the
same
fate
might
overtake
one
who
sate
at
greek
tragedies
expecting
them
to
hurry
at
his
bidding
the
swift
rush
will
come
sure
enough
swift
and
wild
with
almost
intolerable
passion
but
it
will
not
come
anywhere
near
the
first
scenes
we
shall
have
a
dialogue
in
longish
speeches
each
more
or
less
balanced
against
its
fellow
beautiful
no
doubt
and
perhaps
moving
but
slow
as
music
is
slow
or
we
shall
have
a
lyrical
scene
strophe
exactly
balanced
against
antistrophe
more
beautiful
but
slower
still
in
its
movement
and
often
at
first
hearing
a
little
difficult
to
follow
poetry
is
there
and
drama
is
there
and
character
and
plot
interest
but
often
they
are
unrolled
before
you
not
as
things
immediately
happening
but
as
things
to
feel
and
reflect
upon
it
is
a
bigger
world
than
ours
and
every
movement
in
it
is
slower
and
larger
and
when
the
poet
wants
to
show
us
the
heroine
state
of
mind
his
method
will
be
quite
different
from
ours
we
should
rack
our
brains
to
compose
a
natural
dialogue
in
which
her
state
of
mind
would
appear
or
we
should
make
her
best
friend
explain
what
she
is
like
or
we
should
invent
small
incidents
to
throw
light
upon
her
and
our
language
would
all
the
time
be
carefully
naturalistic
not
a
bit
or
if
the
poet
within
us
rebels
hardly
a
bit
more
dignified
than
the
average
diction
of
afternoon
tea
the
ancient
poet
has
no
artifice
at
all
his
heroine
simply
walks
forward
and
explains
her
own
feelings
but
she
will
come
at
some
moment
that
seems
just
the
right
one
she
will
come
to
us
through
a
cloud
as
it
were
of
musical
emotion
from
the
chorus
and
her
words
when
she
speaks
will
be
frankly
the
language
of
poetry
they
will
be
none
the
less
sincere
or
exact
for
that
when
phaedra
in
the
has
resolved
to
die
rather
than
show
her
love
much
less
attempt
to
satisfy
it
and
yet
has
been
so
weakened
by
her
long
struggle
that
she
will
not
be
able
to
resist
much
longer
she
explains
herself
to
the
chorus
in
a
long
speech
o
women
dwellers
in
this
portal
seat
of
pelops
land
looking
towards
my
crete
how
oft
in
other
days
than
these
have
i
through
night
long
hours
thought
of
man
misery
and
how
this
life
is
wrecked
and
to
mine
eyes
not
in
man
knowledge
not
in
wisdom
lies
the
lack
that
makes
for
sorrow
nay
we
scan
and
know
the
right
for
wit
hath
many
a
man
but
will
not
to
the
last
end
strive
and
serve
for
some
grow
too
soon
weary
and
some
swerve
to
other
paths
setting
before
the
right
the
diverse
image
of
delight
and
many
are
delights
beneath
the
sun
it
is
not
the
language
that
any
real
woman
ever
spoke
and
it
is
not
meant
to
be
but
it
is
exactly
the
thought
which
this
woman
may
have
thought
and
felt
transmuted
into
a
special
kind
of
high
poetry
and
the
women
of
the
chorus
who
are
listening
to
it
are
like
no
kind
of
concrete
earthly
listeners
they
are
the
sort
of
listeners
that
are
suited
to
thoughts
rather
than
words
and
their
own
answer
at
the
end
comes
not
like
a
real
comment
but
like
a
note
of
music
when
she
finishes
defending
her
resolve
to
die
rather
than
sin
all
this
earth
to
every
false
man
that
hour
comes
apace
when
time
holds
up
a
mirror
to
his
face
and
marvelling
there
he
stares
to
see
how
foul
his
be
it
not
so
with
me
they
answer
ah
god
how
sweet
is
virtue
and
how
wise
and
honour
its
due
meed
in
all
men
eyes
a
commonplace
a
not
very
original
remark
there
is
no
need
for
any
original
remark
what
is
needed
is
a
note
of
harmony
in
words
and
thought
and
that
is
what
we
are
given
at
a
later
stage
in
the
play
we
shall
come
on
another
fixed
element
in
the
tragedy
the
messenger
speech
it
was
probably
in
the
ritual
it
was
expected
in
the
play
and
it
was
and
is
still
on
the
stage
immensely
dramatic
and
effective
modern
writers
like
masefield
and
wilfred
blunt
have
seen
what
use
can
be
made
of
a
messenger
speech
now
for
the
understanding
of
the
speech
itself
what
is
needed
is
to
read
it
several
times
to
mark
out
exactly
the
stages
of
story
told
and
the
gradual
rising
of
emotion
and
excitement
up
to
the
highest
point
which
is
as
usual
near
the
end
but
not
at
the
end
the
end
sinks
back
to
something
like
calm
it
would
take
too
long
to
analyse
a
particular
messenger
speech
paragraph
by
paragraph
and
the
printed
page
can
not
of
course
illustrate
the
constant
varieties
of
tension
of
pace
and
of
emphasis
that
are
needed
but
i
find
the
following
notes
for
the
guidance
of
an
actor
opposite
the
speech
in
an
old
copy
of
my
opposite
the
first
lines
comes
quiet
slow
simple
then
quicker
big
at
o
zeus
hated
me
then
drop
tension
story
pause
more
interest
mystery
awe
rising
excitement
excitement
well
controlled
steady
excitement
steady
swifter
up
excitement
rising
up
but
still
controlled
up
full
steam
let
it
go
highest
point
down
to
quiet
mystery
pause
end
steady
with
emotion
these
notes
have
of
course
no
authority
as
they
stand
they
are
due
partly
to
my
own
conjecture
partly
to
observation
of
a
remarkable
performance
but
they
have
this
interest
about
them
they
grow
out
of
the
essential
nature
of
the
speech
and
probably
would
in
their
general
tenour
be
accepted
by
most
students
and
further
some
very
similar
scheme
would
suit
not
only
almost
every
messenger
speech
but
also
with
the
necessary
modifications
almost
every
greek
tragedy
as
a
whole
the
quiet
beginning
the
constant
rise
of
tension
through
various
moods
and
various
changes
of
tone
up
to
a
climax
the
carefully
arranged
drop
from
the
climax
to
the
steady
close
without
bathos
and
without
any
wrecking
of
the
continuity
but
there
is
another
point
about
messengers
that
can
be
more
easily
illustrated
their
entrance
in
euripides
is
nearly
always
carefully
prepared
the
point
is
of
cardinal
importance
and
needs
some
explanation
in
mere
literature
it
is
the
words
that
matter
in
dramatic
literature
it
is
partly
the
words
and
partly
the
situation
in
which
they
are
uttered
a
messenger
speech
ought
not
only
to
be
a
good
story
in
itself
but
it
ought
to
be
so
prepared
and
led
up
to
that
before
the
speaker
begins
we
are
longing
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
an
instance
of
a
messenger
speech
with
no
preparation
is
in
sophocles
the
i
do
not
at
all
suggest
that
preparation
is
needed
very
likely
the
situation
itself
is
enough
oedipus
has
rushed
into
the
house
in
a
fury
of
despair
and
the
messenger
simply
walks
out
of
the
house
crying
o
ye
above
this
land
in
honour
old
exalted
what
a
tale
shall
ye
be
told
what
sights
shall
see
and
tears
of
horror
shed
contrast
with
this
the
preparation
in
the
hippolytus
cursed
and
of
course
wrongfully
cursed
by
his
father
theseus
has
gone
forth
to
exile
his
friends
and
the
women
of
the
chorus
have
been
grieving
for
him
theseus
has
refused
to
listen
to
any
plea
then
leader
of
the
chorus
look
yonder
surely
from
the
prince
is
one
that
cometh
full
of
haste
and
we
are
all
watching
a
man
in
great
haste
enters
observe
what
he
says
henchman
ye
women
whither
shall
i
go
to
seek
king
theseus
is
he
in
this
dwelling
speak
our
suspense
deepens
the
leader
evidently
has
hesitated
in
her
answer
she
wants
to
ask
a
question
but
at
this
moment
the
door
opens
and
she
falls
back
leader
lo
where
he
cometh
through
the
castle
gate
through
the
gate
comes
theseus
wrapped
in
gloom
evidently
trying
still
to
forget
hippolytus
the
henchman
crosses
his
path
henchman
o
king
i
bear
thee
tidings
of
dire
weight
to
thee
yea
and
to
every
man
i
ween
from
athens
to
the
marches
of
trozên
will
theseus
guess
will
he
see
that
this
is
one
of
his
son
servants
at
any
rate
he
shows
no
sign
of
so
doing
theseus
what
some
new
stroke
hath
touched
unknown
to
me
the
sister
cities
of
my
sovranty
henchman
hippolytus
is
nay
not
dead
but
stark
outstretched
a
hairsbreadth
this
side
of
the
dark
the
forbidden
name
is
spoken
there
is
evidently
a
moment
of
shock
but
how
will
theseus
take
the
news
will
he
soften
theseus
though
how
slain
was
there
some
other
man
whose
wife
he
had
like
mine
defiled
who
sought
his
life
stung
by
the
taunt
the
henchman
answers
boldly
henchman
his
own
wild
team
destroyed
him
and
the
dire
curse
of
thy
lips
the
boon
of
the
great
sire
is
granted
thee
o
king
and
thy
son
slain
will
theseus
turn
in
fury
on
the
speaker
or
will
he
even
now
soften
neither
theseus
ye
gods
and
thou
poseidon
not
in
vain
i
called
thee
father
thou
hast
heard
my
prayer
the
shock
is
heavy
but
he
recovers
his
calm
and
with
it
comes
the
horrible
conviction
that
his
curse
was
just
and
the
gods
have
struck
dead
a
guilty
man
how
did
he
die
speak
on
how
closed
the
snare
of
heaven
to
slay
the
shamer
of
my
blood
then
the
messenger
begins
his
story
such
preparations
are
regular
in
euripides
in
the
orestes
has
gone
forth
to
find
king
aegisthus
and
if
possible
slay
him
electra
is
waiting
in
her
hut
a
drawn
sword
across
her
knees
sworn
to
die
if
orestes
fails
how
is
the
messenger
brought
on
first
the
leader
of
the
chorus
thinks
she
hears
a
noise
in
the
distance
she
is
not
sure
yes
a
noise
of
fighting
she
calls
electra
who
comes
the
sword
in
her
hand
the
noise
increases
a
cry
cheering
something
has
happened
but
what
the
cheers
sound
like
argive
voices
aegisthus
men
cries
electra
then
let
me
die
the
chorus
restrain
her
there
is
no
messenger
orestes
would
have
sent
a
messenger
wait
wait
cries
the
leader
holding
her
arm
and
a
man
rushes
in
shouting
victory
orestes
has
slain
aegisthus
and
we
are
free
that
seems
enough
but
even
now
euripides
has
not
extracted
his
full
effect
from
the
situation
electra
steeped
to
the
lips
in
fears
and
suspicions
recoils
from
the
man
who
are
you
it
is
a
plot
she
must
get
the
sword
the
man
bids
her
look
at
him
again
he
is
her
brother
servant
she
saw
him
with
orestes
an
hour
ago
she
looks
remembers
and
throws
her
arms
round
the
man
neck
tell
me
again
tell
me
all
that
happened
and
so
the
messenger
begins
this
art
of
preparation
belongs
of
course
to
the
modern
stage
as
much
as
to
the
ancient
or
more
so
do
the
similar
arts
of
making
the
right
juncture
between
scenes
of
arranging
the
contrasts
and
clashes
and
especially
of
so
ending
each
scene
as
to
make
the
spectator
look
eagerly
for
the
next
move
he
must
be
given
just
enough
notion
of
the
future
to
whet
his
appetite
not
enough
to
satisfy
it
these
are
general
rules
that
apply
to
all
good
drama
they
can
all
be
studied
in
book
a
manual
of
in
ancient
times
they
were
more
developed
by
euripides
than
by
his
predecessors
but
that
is
all
we
need
say
prologue
set
speech
messenger
there
still
remain
two
to
a
modern
reader
of
greek
tragedies
the
ex
or
god
from
the
machine
and
the
chorus
about
the
appearance
of
the
god
we
need
say
little
we
have
seen
above
that
an
epiphany
of
some
divine
being
or
a
resurrection
of
some
dead
hero
seems
to
have
been
an
integral
part
of
the
old
ritual
and
thus
has
its
natural
place
in
tragedy
his
special
duty
is
to
bring
the
action
to
a
quiet
close
and
to
ordain
the
ritual
on
which
the
tragedy
is
based
thus
making
the
performance
itself
a
fulfilment
of
the
command
see
above
the
actual
history
of
this
epiphany
is
curious
as
far
as
our
defective
evidence
allows
us
to
draw
conclusions
we
can
make
out
that
aeschylus
habitually
used
a
divine
epiphany
but
that
he
generally
kept
it
for
the
last
play
of
a
trilogy
that
he
often
had
a
whole
galaxy
of
gods
and
that
with
some
exceptions
his
gods
walked
the
floor
of
earth
with
the
other
actors
the
evidence
for
this
is
given
in
miss
harrison
pp
ff
sophocles
moving
towards
a
more
natural
and
less
ritual
tragedy
used
the
divine
epiphany
comparatively
little
euripides
somewhat
curiously
for
one
so
hostile
to
the
current
mythology
intensified
this
ritual
element
in
drama
as
he
did
all
the
others
and
he
used
it
more
and
more
as
he
grew
older
he
evidently
liked
it
for
its
own
sake
there
is
one
view
about
the
ex
which
needs
a
word
of
correction
it
is
widely
entertained
and
comes
chiefly
from
it
takes
the
as
a
device
and
a
very
unskilful
one
for
somehow
finishing
a
story
that
has
got
into
a
hopeless
tangle
the
poet
is
supposed
to
have
piled
up
ingenious
complications
and
troubles
until
he
can
not
see
any
way
out
and
has
to
cut
the
knot
by
the
intervention
of
something
miraculous
in
this
case
of
a
god
now
devices
of
this
sort
the
sudden
appearance
of
rich
uncles
the
discovery
of
new
wills
or
of
infants
changed
at
birth
and
the
like
are
more
or
less
common
weaknesses
in
romantic
literature
hence
it
was
natural
that
horace
view
about
euripides
god
should
be
uncritically
accepted
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
mere
mistake
it
never
in
any
single
case
holds
good
not
even
in
the
and
there
are
some
plays
like
the
in
in
which
so
far
from
the
god
coming
to
clear
up
a
tangled
plot
the
plot
has
to
be
diverted
at
the
last
moment
so
as
to
provide
an
excuse
for
the
god
arrival
euripides
evidently
liked
a
supernatural
ending
and
when
he
had
to
do
without
a
real
god
as
in
the
and
the
he
was
apt
to
end
with
winged
chariots
and
prophecies
can
we
in
the
least
understand
what
he
gained
by
it
we
must
remember
one
or
two
things
the
epiphany
was
in
the
ritual
it
was
no
new
invention
in
itself
the
only
new
thing
apparently
was
an
improved
piece
of
stage
machinery
enabling
the
god
to
appear
more
effectively
further
if
we
try
to
put
ourselves
into
the
minds
of
fifth
century
greeks
there
was
probably
nothing
absurd
nothing
even
unlikely
in
supposing
the
visible
appearance
of
a
god
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
that
of
tragedy
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
tragedy
were
themselves
almost
divine
they
were
all
figures
in
the
great
heroic
saga
and
almost
all
of
them
the
evidence
is
clear
received
actual
worship
if
orestes
or
agamemnon
is
present
on
the
stage
it
is
not
surprising
that
apollo
should
appear
to
them
it
is
i
think
chiefly
due
to
the
mistake
of
the
realism
of
euripides
that
recent
writers
myself
at
one
time
included
have
been
so
much
troubled
over
these
divine
epiphanies
i
suspect
also
that
we
are
troubled
by
a
difference
of
convention
about
the
way
in
which
supernatural
beings
ought
to
speak
we
moderns
like
them
to
be
abrupt
thunderous
wrapped
in
mystery
we
expect
the
style
of
ancient
hebrew
or
norse
poetry
probably
a
greek
would
think
both
barbaric
at
any
rate
the
greek
gods
both
in
euripides
and
elsewhere
affect
a
specially
smooth
and
fluent
and
lucid
utterance
and
apart
from
the
artistic
convention
there
is
a
historical
consideration
which
we
must
never
forget
though
we
are
constantly
tempted
to
do
so
a
athenian
of
the
fifth
century
before
christ
was
after
all
not
as
securely
lifted
above
what
he
called
primaeval
simplicity
as
a
similar
man
in
western
europe
in
the
eighteenth
or
nineteenth
century
after
he
was
just
beginning
with
great
daring
and
brilliance
to
grasp
at
something
like
a
philosophic
or
scientific
view
of
the
world
but
his
hold
was
very
precarious
and
partial
and
when
it
slipped
he
fell
unsuspectingly
into
strange
abysses
a
visible
god
in
the
theatre
laid
probably
no
more
strain
on
his
credulity
than
say
a
prophetic
dream
on
ours
however
the
above
considerations
are
only
pleas
in
mitigation
of
sentence
they
tend
to
show
that
the
ex
was
not
in
itself
ridiculous
to
the
contemporaries
of
euripides
we
must
go
further
and
try
to
see
why
he
liked
it
the
best
way
is
simply
with
our
antecedent
prejudices
removed
to
read
and
some
of
the
best
epiphany
scenes
those
for
instance
which
close
the
the
the
or
the
we
have
already
seen
in
the
how
the
poet
can
use
his
gods
for
delivering
his
essential
moral
judgment
on
the
story
the
condemnation
of
revenge
the
pity
for
mankind
the
opening
up
of
a
larger
atmosphere
in
which
the
horror
through
which
we
have
just
passed
falls
into
its
due
in
the
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
artemis
scene
speaks
for
itself
and
makes
a
marvellous
ending
notably
it
attains
an
effect
which
could
scarcely
be
reached
in
any
other
way
a
strange
poignant
note
amid
the
beauty
where
mortal
emotion
breaks
against
the
cliffs
of
immortal
calm
after
many
words
of
tenderness
artemis
finishes
ff
farewell
i
may
not
watch
man
fleeting
breath
nor
stain
mine
eyes
with
the
effluence
of
death
and
sure
that
terror
now
is
very
near
goddess
slowly
rises
and
floats
hippolytus
farewell
farewell
most
blessed
lift
thee
clear
of
soiling
men
thou
wilt
not
grieve
in
heaven
for
our
long
love
father
thou
art
forgiven
it
was
her
will
i
am
not
wroth
with
thee
i
have
obeyed
her
all
my
days
of
course
the
epiphany
does
not
give
what
our
jaded
senses
secretly
demand
a
strong
curtain
it
gives
the
antique
peaceful
close
the
concrete
men
and
women
whom
we
have
seen
before
us
striving
and
suffering
dissolve
into
the
beautiful
mist
of
legend
strife
and
passion
and
sharp
cries
sink
away
into
the
telling
of
old
fables
then
the
fables
themselves
have
their
lines
of
consequence
reaching
out
to
touch
the
present
world
and
the
thing
that
we
are
doing
now
to
make
it
the
fulfilment
of
an
ancient
command
or
prophecy
to
give
it
a
meaning
that
we
had
never
realized
and
thus
we
are
awakened
to
the
concrete
theatre
and
the
audience
and
the
life
about
us
not
with
a
shock
but
gradually
like
one
lying
with
his
eyes
half
shut
and
thinking
about
a
dream
that
has
just
gone
i
do
not
for
a
moment
say
that
the
divine
epiphany
is
the
right
or
even
the
best
way
of
ending
any
tragedy
i
only
plead
that
if
we
use
our
imaginations
we
can
find
in
it
a
very
rare
beauty
and
can
understand
why
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
world
dramatists
held
to
it
so
firmly
chapter
ix
the
art
of
euripides
continued
the
chorus
conclusion
and
lastly
there
is
the
chorus
at
once
the
strangest
and
the
most
beautiful
of
all
these
ancient
and
remote
conventions
if
we
can
understand
the
chorus
we
have
got
to
the
very
heart
of
greek
tragedy
the
objections
to
the
chorus
are
plain
to
any
infant
these
dozen
homogeneous
persons
old
men
or
young
women
eternally
present
and
almost
never
doing
anything
intruded
on
action
that
often
demands
the
utmost
privacy
their
absurdity
on
any
plane
of
realism
is
manifest
we
need
waste
no
more
words
upon
it
verisimilitude
is
simply
thrown
to
the
winds
that
is
no
doubt
a
great
sacrifice
and
fine
artists
do
not
as
a
rule
incur
a
sacrifice
without
making
sure
of
some
compensating
gain
let
us
try
to
find
out
what
that
gain
was
or
at
least
what
the
great
greek
artists
were
aiming
at
and
let
us
begin
by
forgetting
the
modern
stage
altogether
and
thinking
ourselves
back
to
the
very
origins
of
drama
the
word
chorus
means
dance
or
there
were
such
dancing
floors
on
greek
soil
before
ever
the
greeks
came
there
they
have
been
found
in
prehistoric
crete
and
in
the
islands
we
hear
in
homer
of
the
houses
and
of
the
morning
star
the
dance
was
as
old
as
mankind
only
it
was
a
kind
of
dance
that
we
have
almost
forgotten
the
ancient
dance
was
not
like
our
ballets
rooted
in
sexual
emotion
it
was
religious
it
was
a
form
of
prayer
it
consisted
in
the
use
of
the
whole
body
every
limb
and
every
muscle
to
express
somehow
that
overflow
of
emotion
for
which
a
man
has
no
words
and
primitive
man
had
less
command
of
words
than
we
have
when
the
men
were
away
on
the
the
women
prayed
for
them
with
all
their
bodies
they
danced
for
the
men
safe
return
when
the
tribe
land
was
parching
for
lack
of
rain
the
tribesmen
danced
for
the
rain
to
come
the
dance
did
not
necessarily
imply
movement
it
might
consist
in
simply
maintaining
the
same
rigid
attitude
as
when
moses
held
out
his
arms
during
the
battle
with
the
amalekites
or
ahure
in
the
egyptian
story
waited
kneeling
and
fasting
for
nefrekepta
return
now
if
we
consider
what
kind
of
emotion
will
specially
call
for
this
form
of
expression
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
will
be
the
sort
that
tends
quickly
to
get
beyond
words
religious
emotions
of
all
kinds
helpless
desire
ineffectual
regret
and
all
feelings
about
the
past
when
we
think
of
the
kind
of
ritual
from
which
tragedy
emerged
the
lament
for
a
dead
god
we
can
see
how
well
a
dance
was
fitted
in
primitive
times
to
express
the
emotions
that
we
call
tragic
this
dance
gradually
grew
into
drama
how
it
did
so
is
an
old
story
into
the
inarticulate
mass
of
emotion
and
dumb
show
which
is
the
dance
there
comes
some
more
articulate
element
there
comes
some
one
who
relates
or
definitely
enacts
the
actual
death
or
pathos
of
the
hero
while
the
chorus
goes
on
as
before
expressing
emotion
about
it
this
emotion
it
is
easy
to
see
may
be
quite
different
from
that
felt
by
the
hero
there
is
implied
in
the
contemplation
of
any
great
deed
this
ultimate
emotion
which
is
not
as
a
rule
felt
by
the
actual
doers
of
it
and
is
not
at
its
highest
power
to
be
expressed
by
the
ordinary
language
of
dialogue
the
dramatist
may
make
his
characters
express
all
that
they
can
properly
feel
he
may
put
into
articulate
dialogue
all
that
it
will
bear
but
there
still
remains
some
residue
which
no
one
on
the
stage
can
personally
feel
and
which
can
only
express
itself
as
music
or
yearning
of
the
body
this
residue
finds
its
one
instrument
in
the
chorus
imagine
the
death
of
some
modern
hero
of
lincoln
or
of
nelson
treated
in
the
greek
form
we
should
have
first
a
messenger
bringing
news
of
the
battle
of
trafalgar
or
the
in
the
washington
theatre
the
hero
would
be
borne
in
dying
his
friends
would
weep
over
him
we
should
hear
his
last
words
but
there
would
always
remain
some
essential
emotion
or
reflection
sadness
triumph
pathos
thoughts
of
the
future
from
which
this
man
will
be
lacking
or
of
the
meaning
of
this
death
in
human
history
neither
lincoln
nor
nelson
can
express
this
nor
without
falsity
any
of
their
human
companions
in
a
novel
the
author
can
express
it
in
a
modern
play
or
a
severely
realistic
novel
it
is
generally
not
expressed
except
by
a
significant
silence
or
some
symbol
for
realistic
work
demands
extreme
quickness
in
its
audience
and
can
only
make
its
effect
on
imaginations
already
trained
by
romance
and
idealism
on
the
greek
stage
the
chorus
will
be
there
just
for
this
purpose
to
express
in
music
and
movement
this
ultimate
emotion
and
as
haigh
puts
it
to
shed
a
lyrical
splendour
over
the
whole
it
will
translate
the
particular
act
into
something
universal
it
will
make
a
change
in
all
that
it
touches
increasing
the
elements
of
beauty
and
significance
and
leaving
out
or
reducing
the
element
of
crude
pain
this
is
nothing
extraordinary
it
is
the
normal
business
of
poetry
at
least
of
great
tragic
poetry
an
actual
bereavement
is
an
experience
consisting
of
almost
nothing
but
crude
pain
when
it
is
translated
into
religion
or
poetry
into
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
or
into
break
break
break
it
has
somehow
become
a
thing
of
beauty
and
even
of
comfort
the
important
thing
to
observe
is
what
cornford
has
explained
in
his
pp
ff
that
a
greek
tragedy
normally
proceeds
in
two
planes
or
two
worlds
when
the
actors
are
on
the
stage
we
are
following
the
deeds
and
fates
of
so
many
particular
individuals
lovers
plotters
enemies
or
whatever
they
are
at
a
particular
point
of
time
and
space
when
the
stage
is
empty
and
the
choral
odes
begin
we
have
no
longer
the
particular
acts
and
places
and
persons
but
something
universal
and
eternal
the
body
as
it
were
is
gone
and
the
essence
remains
we
have
the
greatness
of
love
the
vanity
of
revenge
the
law
of
eternal
retribution
or
perhaps
the
eternal
doubt
whether
in
any
sense
the
world
is
governed
by
righteousness
thus
the
talk
about
improbability
with
which
we
started
falls
into
its
proper
insignificance
the
chorus
in
euripides
is
frequently
blamed
by
modern
scholars
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
further
the
action
that
its
presence
is
improbable
or
its
odes
irrelevant
the
answer
is
that
none
of
these
things
constitute
the
business
of
the
chorus
its
business
is
something
considerably
higher
and
more
important
of
action
and
relevancy
we
will
speak
later
they
are
both
closely
connected
with
the
question
of
verisimilitude
and
as
for
verisimilitude
we
simply
do
not
think
of
it
we
are
not
imitating
the
outside
of
life
we
are
expressing
its
soul
not
depicting
its
body
and
if
we
did
attempt
verisimilitude
we
should
find
that
in
a
chorus
it
is
simply
unattainable
in
nelson
case
a
chorus
of
sailors
would
be
every
bit
as
improbable
as
a
chorus
of
mermaids
or
angels
and
on
the
whole
rather
more
strikingly
so
if
we
try
to
think
of
the
most
effective
choruses
in
modern
tragedies
i
do
not
think
we
shall
hit
on
any
bands
of
strolling
players
or
flower
girls
or
church
choirs
or
other
choruses
that
aim
at
naturalness
we
shall
probably
go
straight
to
the
choruses
of
spirits
in
or
those
of
the
ages
and
the
pities
in
hardy
the
chorus
belongs
not
to
the
plane
of
ordinary
experience
where
people
are
real
and
act
and
make
apposite
remarks
but
to
that
higher
world
where
in
cornford
words
metaphor
as
we
call
it
is
the
very
stuff
of
life
with
very
few
exceptions
greek
choruses
are
composed
of
beings
who
are
naturally
the
denizens
or
near
neighbours
of
such
a
world
sometimes
they
are
frankly
supernatural
as
in
the
or
half
supernatural
as
in
the
sometimes
they
are
human
beings
seen
through
the
mist
of
a
great
emotion
like
the
weeping
rachels
of
the
the
captives
of
the
or
the
the
old
men
who
dream
dreams
in
the
even
if
they
start
as
common
men
or
women
sooner
or
later
they
become
transformed
the
problem
of
the
chorus
to
euripides
was
not
how
to
make
it
as
little
objectionable
as
possible
it
was
how
to
get
the
greatest
and
highest
value
out
of
it
and
that
resolves
itself
largely
into
the
problem
of
handling
these
two
planes
of
action
using
now
the
lower
and
now
the
upper
now
keeping
them
separate
now
mingling
them
and
at
times
letting
one
forcibly
invade
the
other
i
can
not
here
go
into
details
of
the
various
effects
obtained
from
the
chorus
by
euripides
but
i
will
take
a
few
typical
ones
selecting
in
each
case
scenes
that
have
been
loudly
condemned
by
critics
the
first
and
most
normal
effect
is
to
use
the
chorus
for
relief
to
bring
in
as
it
were
the
ideal
world
to
heal
the
wounds
of
the
real
it
is
not
of
course
comic
relief
as
indulged
in
so
freely
by
the
elizabethans
it
is
a
transition
from
horror
or
pain
to
mere
beauty
or
music
with
hardly
any
change
of
tension
i
mean
that
if
the
pain
has
brought
tears
to
your
eyes
the
beauty
will
be
such
as
to
keep
them
there
while
of
course
changing
their
character
it
is
this
use
of
lyrics
that
enables
the
greek
playwright
to
treat
freely
scenes
of
horror
and
yet
never
lose
the
prevailing
atmosphere
of
high
beauty
look
at
the
salamis
chorus
in
the
immediately
following
the
child
death
the
lyrics
between
oedipus
and
the
chorus
when
he
has
just
entered
with
his
bleeding
eyes
or
in
particular
the
song
sung
by
the
chorus
in
just
after
phaedra
has
rushed
off
to
kill
herself
we
have
had
a
scene
of
high
tension
and
almost
intolerable
pain
and
the
chorus
left
alone
make
certainly
no
relevant
remarks
i
can
think
of
no
relevant
remark
that
would
not
be
an
absurd
bathos
they
simply
break
out
ff
could
i
take
me
to
some
cavern
for
mine
hiding
in
the
where
the
sun
scarce
hath
trod
or
a
cloud
make
the
home
of
mine
abiding
as
a
bird
among
the
of
god
it
is
just
the
emotion
that
was
in
our
own
hearts
the
cry
for
escape
to
some
place
however
sad
that
is
still
beautiful
to
the
poplar
grove
by
the
adriatic
where
his
sisters
weep
for
phaethon
or
at
last
as
the
song
continues
and
grows
bolder
to
some
place
that
has
happiness
as
well
as
beauty
to
that
strand
of
the
daughters
of
the
sunset
where
a
sound
of
living
waters
never
ceaseth
in
god
quiet
garden
by
the
sea
and
earth
the
ancient
increaseth
joy
among
the
meadows
like
a
tree
and
the
wish
for
escape
brings
an
actual
escape
on
some
wind
of
beauty
as
it
were
from
the
chorus
own
world
this
is
on
the
whole
the
most
normal
use
of
the
choric
odes
though
occasionally
they
may
also
be
used
for
helping
on
the
action
for
instance
in
the
ode
immediately
following
that
just
quoted
the
chorus
gives
a
sort
of
prophetic
or
clairvoyant
description
of
phaedra
suicide
but
the
greek
chorus
does
not
only
sing
its
great
odes
on
an
empty
stage
it
also
carries
on
by
the
mouth
of
its
leader
a
certain
amount
of
ordinary
dialogue
with
the
actors
its
work
here
is
generally
kept
unobtrusive
neutral
and
when
a
traveller
wants
to
ask
his
way
when
the
hero
or
heroine
announces
some
resolve
or
gives
some
direction
the
leader
is
there
to
make
the
necessary
response
but
only
within
certain
carefully
guarded
limits
the
leader
must
never
become
a
definite
character
with
strongly
personal
views
he
must
never
take
really
effective
or
violent
action
he
never
i
think
gives
information
which
we
do
not
already
possess
or
expresses
views
which
could
seem
paradoxical
or
original
he
is
an
echo
a
sort
of
music
in
the
air
this
comes
out
clearly
in
another
fine
scene
of
the
where
phaedra
is
listening
at
the
door
and
the
leader
of
the
chorus
listens
with
her
echoing
and
making
more
vibrant
own
emotion
at
times
in
these
dialogue
scenes
an
effect
is
obtained
by
allowing
the
chorus
to
turn
for
a
moment
into
ordinary
flesh
and
blood
in
the
in
ff
the
safe
escape
of
iphigenîa
and
orestes
depends
on
the
secrecy
of
the
chorus
of
greek
captives
iphigenîa
implores
them
to
be
silent
and
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
because
of
the
danger
they
consent
iphigenîa
with
one
word
of
radiant
gratitude
forgets
all
about
them
and
leaves
the
stage
to
arrange
things
with
her
brother
and
the
captives
left
alone
watch
a
winging
its
way
towards
argos
whither
iphigenîa
is
now
going
and
they
shall
never
go
and
break
into
a
beautiful
song
similarly
in
the
splendid
finale
of
aeschylus
the
daughters
of
ocean
who
have
been
mostly
on
the
unearthly
plane
throughout
the
play
are
suddenly
warned
to
stand
aside
and
leave
prometheus
before
his
doom
falls
in
a
rush
of
human
passion
they
refuse
to
desert
him
and
are
hurled
with
him
into
hell
at
other
times
the
effect
is
reached
by
emphasizing
just
the
other
side
the
unearthliness
of
the
chorus
in
the
for
instance
when
the
tyrant
lycus
is
about
to
make
some
suppliants
leave
the
protection
of
an
altar
by
burning
them
a
kind
of
atrocity
which
just
avoided
the
technical
religious
offence
of
violating
sanctuary
the
chorus
of
old
men
tries
for
a
moment
to
raise
its
hand
against
the
tyrant
soldiers
it
is
like
the
figures
of
a
dream
trying
to
fight
words
and
a
thing
seen
in
a
dream
of
the
night
as
the
poet
himself
says
trying
to
battle
against
flesh
and
blood
a
helpless
visionary
transient
struggle
which
is
beautiful
for
a
moment
but
would
be
grotesque
if
it
lasted
again
in
the
lost
there
is
a
scene
where
the
tyrant
is
inveigled
into
a
hut
by
murderers
he
manages
to
dash
out
and
appeals
to
the
chorus
of
old
men
for
help
but
they
are
not
really
old
men
they
are
only
ancient
echoes
or
voices
of
justice
who
speak
his
doom
upon
him
standing
moveless
while
the
slayers
come
these
examples
enable
us
to
understand
a
still
stronger
effect
of
the
same
kind
which
occurs
in
the
and
has
until
very
lately
been
utterly
condemned
and
misunderstood
it
is
an
effect
rather
reminding
one
of
the
greek
fable
of
a
human
wrong
so
terrible
that
it
shook
the
very
sun
out
of
his
course
it
is
like
the
human
cry
in
the
which
shook
the
eternal
peace
of
the
gods
in
heaven
there
is
something
delirious
about
it
an
impossible
invasion
of
the
higher
world
by
the
lower
a
shattering
of
unapproachable
bars
medea
has
gone
to
murder
her
children
inside
the
house
the
chorus
is
left
chanting
its
own
and
our
anguish
outside
why
do
they
not
rush
in
and
save
the
children
asked
the
critics
in
the
first
place
because
that
is
not
the
kind
of
action
that
a
chorus
can
ever
perform
that
needs
flesh
and
blood
well
the
critic
continues
if
they
can
not
act
effectively
why
does
euripides
put
them
in
a
position
in
which
we
instinctively
clamour
for
effective
action
and
they
are
absurd
if
they
do
not
act
the
answer
to
that
is
given
in
the
play
itself
they
do
not
rush
in
there
is
no
question
of
their
rushing
in
because
the
door
is
barred
when
jason
in
the
next
scene
tries
to
enter
the
house
he
has
to
use
soldiers
with
crowbars
the
only
action
they
can
possibly
perform
is
the
sort
that
specially
belongs
to
the
chorus
the
action
of
baffled
desire
medea
is
in
the
house
the
chorus
is
chanting
its
sublimated
impersonal
emotion
about
the
love
that
has
turned
to
hate
in
medea
and
its
dread
of
things
to
come
ff
for
fierce
are
the
smitings
back
of
blood
once
shed
where
love
hath
been
god
wrath
upon
them
that
kill
and
an
anguished
earth
and
the
wonder
of
the
dead
haunting
as
music
still
when
a
sudden
cry
is
heard
within
the
song
breaks
short
and
one
woman
speaks
hark
did
ye
hear
heard
ye
the
children
cry
o
miserable
woman
o
abhorred
of
a
child
what
shall
i
do
what
is
it
keep
me
fast
from
mother
other
i
know
nothing
brother
oh
i
think
she
means
to
kill
us
of
the
let
me
go
i
will
help
help
and
save
them
at
the
last
yes
in
god
name
help
quickly
or
we
die
other
she
has
almost
caught
me
now
she
has
a
sword
one
sees
the
women
of
the
chorus
listening
for
the
children
words
then
they
break
as
it
were
from
the
spell
of
their
own
atmosphere
and
fling
themselves
on
the
barred
door
they
beat
in
vain
against
the
bars
and
the
children
voices
cry
for
help
from
the
other
side
but
the
inrush
of
violent
horror
is
only
tolerated
for
a
moment
even
in
the
next
words
we
are
moving
back
to
the
realm
of
formal
poetry
beating
at
the
thou
stone
thou
thing
of
iron
wilt
verily
spill
with
thine
hand
that
life
the
vintage
stored
of
thine
own
agony
a
woman
slew
her
babes
in
days
of
yore
one
only
one
from
dawn
to
eventide
and
in
a
moment
we
are
away
in
a
beautiful
remote
song
about
children
who
have
been
slain
in
legend
that
is
no
longer
a
shriek
heard
in
the
next
room
it
is
the
echo
of
many
cries
of
children
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
children
who
are
now
at
peace
and
whose
ancient
pain
has
become
part
mystery
and
part
music
memory
that
memory
who
was
mother
of
the
muses
has
done
her
work
upon
it
we
see
here
the
justification
of
the
high
formalism
and
convention
of
greek
tragedy
it
can
touch
without
flinching
any
horror
of
tragic
life
without
failing
in
sincerity
and
without
marring
its
normal
atmosphere
of
beauty
it
brings
things
under
the
great
magic
of
something
which
is
hard
to
name
but
which
i
have
tried
in
these
pages
to
indicate
something
that
we
can
think
of
as
eternity
or
the
universal
or
perhaps
even
as
memory
for
memory
used
in
this
way
has
a
magical
power
as
bertrand
russell
has
finely
put
it
in
one
of
his
the
past
does
not
change
or
strive
like
duncan
in
life
fitful
fever
it
sleeps
well
what
was
eager
and
grasping
what
was
petty
and
transitory
has
faded
away
the
things
that
were
beautiful
and
eternal
shine
out
like
stars
in
the
night
this
power
of
transfiguration
belongs
in
varying
degrees
to
all
poetry
but
it
belongs
in
special
force
to
greek
tragedy
and
greek
tragedy
attains
it
in
part
by
all
its
high
religious
traditions
and
severities
of
form
but
most
fully
by
means
of
its
strangest
convention
the
chorus
the
band
of
emotions
and
memories
the
lyric
song
and
the
dance
expressing
things
beyond
speech
it
is
through
this
power
that
tragedy
attain
its
peculiar
quality
of
encouragement
and
triumph
we
must
not
forget
that
aristotle
a
judge
whose
dicta
should
seldom
be
dismissed
without
careful
reflection
distinguishes
tragedy
from
other
forms
of
drama
not
as
the
form
that
represents
human
misery
but
as
that
which
represents
human
goodness
or
nobleness
if
his
mss
are
to
be
trusted
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
tragedy
is
the
representation
of
eudaimonia
or
the
higher
kind
of
happiness
of
course
he
fully
recognizes
the
place
of
death
and
disaster
in
it
and
he
prefers
the
unhappy
ending
the
powers
of
evil
and
horror
must
be
granted
their
full
scope
it
is
only
thus
that
we
can
triumph
over
them
only
when
they
have
worked
their
uttermost
will
do
we
realize
that
there
remains
something
in
man
soul
which
is
forever
beyond
their
grasp
and
has
power
in
its
own
right
to
make
life
beautiful
that
is
the
great
revelation
or
the
great
illusion
of
tragedy
it
is
achieved
apparently
by
a
combination
of
two
extremes
in
matter
a
full
facing
of
tragic
facts
and
in
form
a
resolute
transfiguration
of
them
by
poetry
the
weak
artist
shirks
the
truth
by
a
feeble
idealism
the
prosaic
artist
fails
to
transfigure
it
euripides
seems
to
me
to
have
gone
further
than
any
other
writer
in
the
attempt
to
combine
in
one
unity
these
separate
poles
in
this
lies
for
good
or
evil
his
unique
quality
as
a
poet
to
many
readers
it
seems
that
his
powers
failed
him
his
mixture
of
real
life
and
supernatural
atmosphere
of
wakeful
thought
and
dreaming
legend
remains
a
discord
a
mere
jar
of
overwrought
conventions
and
violent
realism
to
others
it
is
because
of
this
very
quality
that
he
has
earned
the
tremendous
rank
accorded
him
by
goethe
and
in
a
more
limited
sense
by
aristotle
and
still
stands
out
as
he
stood
over
two
thousand
years
ago
even
if
faulty

ways

any

this

the

pronounced

perhaps
in

all

the

the

for
a
large
section
of
the
public
who
are
interested
in
the
liberal
education
of
the
state
daily
it
is
a
thing
very
favourable
to
the
real
success
of
the
home
university
library
that
its
volumes
do
not
merely
attempt
to
feed
ignorance
with
knowledge
the
authors
noticeably
realise
that
the
simple
willing
appetite
of
ignorance
is
not
specially
common
nowadays
what
is
far
more
common
is
a
hunger
which
has
been
partially
but
injudiciously
filled
with
more
or
less
serious
results
of
indigestion
the
food
supplied
is
therefore
frequently
medicinal
as
well
as
nutritious
and
this
is
certainly
what
the
time
requires
each
volume
represents
a
traffic
with
the
of
a
good
brain
operating
with
the
ease
and
interesting
freedom
of
a
specialist
dealing
with
his
own
subject
a
series
which
promises
to
perform
a
real
social
service
we
can
think
of
no
series
now
being
issued
which
better
deserves
support
we
think
if
they
were
given
as
prizes
in
place
of
the
more
costly
rubbish
that
is
wont
to
be
dispensed
on
prize
days
the
pupils
would
find
more
pleasure
and
profit
if
the
publishers
want
a
motto
for
the
series
they
might
well
take
riches
in
a
little
journal
of
the
scheme
was
successful
at
the
start
because
it
met
a
want
among
earnest
readers
but
its
wider
and
sustained
success
surely
comes
from
the
fact
that
it
has
to
a
large
extent
created
and
certainly
refined
the
taste
by
which
it
is
appreciated
