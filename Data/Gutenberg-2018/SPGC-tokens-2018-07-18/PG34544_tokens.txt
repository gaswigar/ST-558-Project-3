this
story
is
found
in
correspondence
dated
april
but
that
version
is
incomplete
the
history
of
tanié
and
la
reymer
is
missing
as
is
the
end
of
the
history
of
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
barbier
dictionary
of
the
anonymous
suggested
that
memory
must
have
failed
him
when
he
attributed
translations
of
first
essays
on
metaphysics
and
the
essays
on
human
understanding
to
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
but
this
was
certainly
not
the
case
diderot
was
only
giving
the
works
of
hume
as
translated
by
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
a
more
general
title
the
political
discourses
make
up
the
second
part
of
the
essays
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
wrote
the
first
translation
of
this
part
of
commerce
of
luxury
of
money
amsterdam
paris
and
lyon
it
includes
only
seven
of
seventeen
discourses
along
with
some
commentary
by
the
translator
abbot
le
blanc
and
later
mauvillon
did
not
publish
their
versions
of
the
same
piece
until
mademoiselle
de
la
translation
of
writings
on
economics
was
included
in
the
xvth
tome
of
the
collections
from
the
leading
economists
she
died
in
this
is
not
a
story
when
one
tells
a
story
it
is
for
a
listener
and
however
short
the
story
is
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
teller
is
not
occasionally
interrupted
by
his
audience
so
i
have
introduced
into
the
narration
that
will
be
read
and
which
is
not
a
story
or
which
is
a
bad
one
if
you
have
doubts
about
that
a
character
that
might
approximate
the
role
of
the
reader
and
i
begin
and
you
conclude
right
there
that
a
subject
this
interesting
must
make
us
dizzy
be
the
talk
of
the
town
for
a
month
be
phrased
and
rephrased
until
flavorless
produce
a
thousand
arguments
at
least
twenty
leaflets
and
around
a
hundred
bits
of
verse
in
favor
or
against
in
spite
of
all
the
finesse
learning
and
pure
grit
of
the
author
given
that
his
work
has
not
lead
to
any
violence
it
is
mediocre
very
mediocre
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
owe
him
a
rather
agreeable
evening
and
that
this
reading
has
brought
what
a
litany
of
vignettes
fired
from
left
and
right
saying
just
one
single
thing
known
for
all
eternity
that
man
and
woman
are
extraordinarily
unfortunate
beasts
nevertheless
the
epidemic
has
won
you
over
and
you
have
contributed
just
like
any
other
whether
or
not
it
be
to
taste
it
is
only
good
taste
to
strike
the
tone
given
when
meeting
company
we
customarily
tidy
up
appearances
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
for
whomever
we
are
seeing
we
pretend
to
be
funny
when
we
are
sad
sad
when
we
would
have
liked
to
be
funny
we
do
not
want
to
appear
out
of
place
anywhere
so
the
literary
hack
politicizes
the
political
pundit
talks
metaphysics
the
metaphysician
moralizes
the
moralist
talks
finance
the
financier
letters
or
logic
rather
than
listen
or
keep
quiet
each
ramble
on
about
what
they
are
ignorant
of
and
everyone
bores
each
other
with
silly
vanity
or
politeness
you
are
in
a
bad
mood
i
usually
am
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
me
to
reserve
my
vignette
for
a
better
time
you
mean
you
will
wait
for
me
to
leave
it
is
not
that
or
you
are
afraid
that
i
might
have
less
indulgence
for
you
face
to
face
than
i
would
for
your
average
gentleman
it
is
not
that
be
agreeable
then
and
tell
me
what
it
is
that
my
vignette
will
not
prove
any
better
than
those
that
have
annoyed
you
hmph
tell
it
anyway
no
you
have
had
enough
you
know
that
of
all
the
ways
the
others
have
enraged
me
yours
is
the
most
unpleasant
and
what
is
mine
that
of
being
asked
to
do
the
thing
you
are
dying
to
do
well
my
friend
i
ask
you
i
pray
you
satisfy
yourself
satisfy
myself
begin
by
god
begin
i
will
try
to
be
short
that
can
not
hurt
here
a
little
out
of
spite
i
coughed
i
spat
i
drew
my
handkerchief
out
slowly
i
blew
my
nose
i
opened
my
snuff
box
i
took
out
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
i
heard
my
fellow
man
say
between
his
teeth
the
telling
is
short
the
preliminaries
are
long
i
had
the
urge
to
call
a
servant
under
the
pretext
of
some
errand
but
i
did
not
and
i
said
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
are
very
good
men
and
very
bad
women
one
sees
that
every
day
and
sometimes
without
leaving
the
house
go
on
go
on
i
knew
an
alsatian
beauty
beautiful
enough
to
make
old
men
come
running
and
stop
younger
ones
in
their
tracks
i
also
knew
her
her
name
was
madame
reymer
that
is
correct
a
newcomer
from
nancy
by
the
name
of
tanié
fell
madly
in
love
with
her
he
was
poor
one
of
those
lost
children
chased
from
the
house
by
harsh
parents
with
a
large
family
thrown
into
the
world
with
no
idea
what
will
become
of
them
knowing
instinctually
that
there
will
never
be
a
worse
sort
than
the
one
they
are
fleeing
from
tanié
was
infatuated
with
madame
raymer
consumed
by
a
passion
that
gave
him
courage
and
ennobled
all
his
actions
in
his
eyes
so
that
he
willingly
performed
those
most
disturbing
and
vile
to
soothe
the
misery
of
his
soul
during
the
day
he
would
work
the
docks
at
evening
he
begged
in
the
streets
it
was
wonderful
but
it
could
not
last
tanié
sick
of
living
on
the
brink
or
rather
of
keeping
a
charming
woman
in
poverty
ever
haunted
by
rich
men
urging
her
to
rid
herself
of
that
beggar
tanié
which
she
would
have
done
fifteen
days
or
a
month
later
and
to
accept
their
riches
decided
to
leave
her
and
set
out
in
search
of
fortune
abroad
he
hunted
around
and
won
passage
on
one
of
the
ships
it
came
time
to
depart
he
took
leave
of
madame
reymer
love
he
said
to
her
can
no
longer
exploit
your
affections
i
have
accepted
the
inevitable
i
am
are
leaving
where
are
you
going
the
islands
you
deserve
something
more
and
i
can
no
longer
come
between
you
and
kindhearted
tanié
what
is
to
become
of
me
traitor
are
surrounded
by
people
who
want
to
please
you
i
release
you
from
your
promises
i
release
you
from
your
vows
find
the
suitor
that
is
most
agreeable
to
you
accept
him
i
beg
of
you
tanié
if
you
so
desire
no
need
to
pantomime
madame
reymer
i
get
it
i
leave
all
i
ask
is
that
you
not
commit
yourself
to
anything
that
might
stand
between
us
permanently
promise
me
my
beautiful
friend
whatever
country
on
earth
i
find
myself
in
you
will
know
something
terrible
has
befallen
me
if
a
year
goes
by
without
my
bearing
you
witness
of
my
tender
attachment
do
not
cry
women
can
cry
on
command
and
do
not
fight
against
plans
that
are
in
the
end
inspired
by
the
reproaches
of
my
heart
and
from
which
they
would
not
keep
and
just
like
that
tanié
left
for
and
just
in
time
for
madame
reymer
as
for
himself
how
would
you
know
i
know
as
well
as
anyone
that
when
tanié
advised
her
to
make
a
choice
she
made
it
well
done
continue
your
narration
tanié
had
a
strong
will
and
an
entrepreneurial
spirit
he
did
not
tarry
in
making
himself
known
he
joined
the
sovereign
council
of
the
cape
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
wisdom
and
equity
he
had
no
ambitions
to
great
fortune
all
he
wanted
was
a
quick
and
an
honest
one
each
year
he
sent
a
portion
of
it
to
madame
reymer
he
reached
his
goal
somewhere
between
nine
and
ten
years
no
i
do
not
believe
he
was
absent
any
longer
than
that
to
present
his
lover
with
a
small
wallet
containing
the
product
of
his
work
and
virtue
and
lucky
for
tanié
it
was
just
at
the
moment
when
she
had
left
the
last
of
his
successors
the
last
yes
so
there
were
several
assuredly
go
on
go
on
but
perhaps
i
have
nothing
left
to
tell
you
that
you
do
not
already
know
better
than
i
what
does
it
matter
go
on
anyway
madame
reymer
and
tanié
occupied
a
rather
pretty
building
on
rue
marguerite
at
my
doorstep
i
took
a
great
liking
to
tanié
and
frequented
his
house
which
was
if
not
opulent
at
least
luxurious
i
can
assure
you
without
having
done
accounting
that
she
had
an
income
of
over
pounds
before
tanié
returned
and
she
kept
it
from
him
yes
why
would
she
she
was
greedy
and
predatory
i
could
see
predatory
but
greedy
a
greedy
courtesan
these
two
lovers
had
lived
in
perfect
harmony
for
five
or
six
years
thanks
to
the
shrewdness
of
the
one
and
the
unconditional
confidence
of
the
other
ah
it
is
true
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
to
enter
a
soul
as
pure
as
the
one
thing
i
did
occasionally
notice
was
that
madame
reymer
quickly
forgot
her
original
poverty
was
tormented
by
her
love
of
wealth
and
splendor
was
humiliated
that
so
beautiful
a
woman
had
traveled
on
foot
that
she
had
not
gone
by
coach
and
the
spark
of
vice
brought
out
the
worst
in
her
you
laugh
it
was
then
that
de
maurepas
hatched
the
plan
to
build
a
market
up
north
the
success
of
the
enterprise
demanded
a
lively
and
intelligent
man
he
had
his
eye
on
tanié
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
the
direction
of
many
important
business
ventures
while
he
was
at
the
cape
which
were
always
carried
out
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
minister
tanié
was
upset
by
this
mark
of
distinction
he
was
so
content
so
happy
with
his
girl
he
loved
he
was
or
he
thought
himself
loved
well
said
what
could
gold
possibly
add
to
his
good
fortune
nothing
but
the
minister
insisted
he
had
to
strengthen
his
resolve
he
had
to
tell
madame
reymer
i
arrived
at
his
quarters
right
at
the
end
of
this
unfortunate
episode
poor
tanié
was
collapsed
in
tears
is
the
matter
my
friend
i
asked
him
between
sobs
he
told
me
is
this
woman
madame
reymer
was
working
calmly
at
a
tapestry
tanié
rose
brusquely
and
left
i
stayed
behind
with
his
lover
who
did
not
allow
me
to
remain
ignorant
of
what
she
thought
of
irrationality
she
exaggerated
the
severity
of
her
financial
state
she
adorned
her
appeal
with
all
the
art
that
a
cunning
mind
like
hers
knows
to
compensate
for
the
sophisms
of
ambition
does
it
amount
to
an
absence
of
two
or
three
years
at
is
some
time
for
a
man
that
you
love
and
who
loves
you
as
much
as
he
loves
me
if
he
loved
me
would
he
hesitate
to
satisfy
me
madame
will
you
not
go
with
him
i
will
not
go
and
as
eccentric
as
he
is
he
has
not
even
suggested
it
to
me
does
he
have
doubts
about
me
do
not
believe
so
not
at
awaiting
him
for
twelve
years
he
can
certainly
count
on
my
good
it
is
one
of
those
unique
opportunities
that
only
presents
itself
once
in
a
lifetime
and
i
do
not
want
the
day
to
come
when
i
must
have
regrets
and
reproach
myself
for
missing
will
have
no
regrets
so
long
as
he
has
the
good
fortune
of
pleasing
is
very
decent
of
you
but
you
can
be
sure
that
he
will
be
very
happy
being
wealthy
when
i
am
old
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
women
to
never
think
of
the
future
it
is
not
mine
the
minister
was
in
paris
his
hotel
was
only
a
foot
from
rue
tanié
met
with
him
there
and
was
hired
he
returned
with
eyes
dry
and
heart
wrung
out
he
said
to
her
saw
de
maurepas
i
have
given
him
my
word
i
will
go
i
will
go
and
you
will
be
my
love
madame
reymer
drops
her
line
of
work
throws
herself
on
tanié
tosses
her
arms
around
his
neck
devastates
him
with
kisses
and
sweet
nothings
it
is
times
like
these
that
let
me
know
i
am
dear
to
you
tanié
answered
her
coldly
want
to
be
she
was
the
little
minx
ten
times
more
so
than
she
was
worth
you
will
be
since
it
is
gold
that
you
love
you
must
seek
it
it
was
tuesday
and
the
minister
had
set
the
date
of
departure
for
friday
without
delay
i
bid
him
farewell
as
he
was
wrestling
with
himself
attempting
to
wrest
himself
from
the
arms
of
the
beautiful
disgraceful
and
cruel
reymer
of
such
a
disorder
of
ideas
hopelessness
agony
i
have
never
seen
a
second
example
this
was
not
a
wail
it
was
an
extended
scream
madame
reymer
was
still
in
bed
he
held
one
of
her
hands
he
could
not
stop
saying
and
repeating
woman
woman
cruel
what
more
do
you
need
than
the
comfort
you
enjoy
and
a
friend
a
lover
such
as
myself
i
have
tried
to
find
fortune
in
the
sweltering
countries
of
america
she
wants
me
to
seek
it
out
once
more
in
the
ice
floes
of
the
north
my
friend
i
am
aware
that
this
woman
is
mad
i
am
aware
that
i
am
foolish
but
i
am
less
afraid
of
death
than
i
am
of
causing
her
sadness
you
want
me
to
leave
you
i
will
leave
he
was
on
his
knees
beside
her
bed
mouth
glued
to
her
hand
and
face
hidden
in
the
covers
which
in
stifling
his
mutterings
only
made
them
sadder
and
more
dreadful
the
bedroom
door
opened
his
head
rose
up
brusquely
he
saw
the
coachman
who
had
come
to
announce
that
the
horses
were
hitched
up
he
cried
out
and
again
hid
his
face
under
the
covers
after
a
silence
he
rose
he
said
to
his
love
me
madame
kiss
me
one
more
time
for
you
will
never
see
me
his
premonition
was
only
too
accurate
he
departed
he
arrived
in
petersburg
and
three
days
later
was
struck
by
a
fever
from
which
he
died
on
the
fourth
i
knew
all
of
that
perhaps
you
were
one
of
successors
you
got
it
and
it
is
with
this
abominable
beauty
that
i
ruined
my
business
poor
tanié
there
are
some
who
would
call
him
silly
i
will
not
defend
him
but
i
will
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
their
bad
luck
sends
them
to
a
woman
as
beautiful
and
duplicitous
as
madame
reymer
you
are
cruel
in
your
choice
of
revenge
moving
on
if
there
are
evil
women
and
good
men
there
are
also
good
women
and
evil
men
and
this
supplement
is
no
more
a
story
than
the
preceding
i
am
sure
the
one
still
living
the
lieutenant
general
of
the
army
the
one
that
married
that
charming
creature
named
lolotte
the
same
a
gallant
man
lover
of
sciences
and
of
scholars
for
a
long
time
he
was
working
on
a
general
history
of
war
in
every
century
and
every
nation
a
staggering
project
to
complete
it
he
called
for
the
help
of
some
young
gentlemen
of
distinguished
merit
like
de
montucla
the
author
of
the
history
of
mathematics
good
lord
he
had
many
men
of
that
caliber
but
the
one
named
gardeil
the
hero
of
the
adventure
that
i
am
going
to
tell
to
you
hardly
yielded
to
him
a
common
passion
for
the
study
of
greek
created
a
bond
between
gardeil
and
i
that
time
the
reciprocity
of
guidance
a
taste
for
seclusion
and
above
all
the
facility
with
which
we
saw
each
other
made
blossom
into
a
rather
striking
intimacy
so
you
were
still
staying
at
the
estrapade
he
street
and
his
lady
friend
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
square
i
call
her
by
her
own
name
because
the
poor
thing
is
no
more
because
her
life
can
only
honor
it
in
every
mind
and
award
it
the
admiration
the
regret
and
the
tears
of
those
that
nature
will
favor
or
punish
with
a
small
portion
of
the
sensibility
of
her
soul
well
your
speech
is
halting
and
i
believe
you
are
crying
i
can
still
see
her
big
dark
eyes
soft
and
twinkling
and
the
moving
sound
of
her
voice
resounding
in
my
ears
and
shaking
my
heart
charming
creature
unique
creature
you
are
no
more
you
have
been
no
more
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
my
heart
still
tightens
at
the
thought
of
you
you
loved
her
no
oh
la
chaux
oh
gardeil
you
were
each
a
marvel
you
for
a
tenderness
you
for
a
ingratitude
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
was
an
honest
woman
she
left
her
parents
to
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
gardeil
gardeil
had
nothing
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
enjoyed
considerable
wealth
and
this
wealth
was
entirely
sacrificed
for
needs
and
whims
she
regretted
neither
the
dissipation
of
her
fortune
nor
her
blackened
reputation
her
lover
took
the
place
of
everything
for
her
so
gardeil
was
a
charmer
amiable
not
at
all
a
small
gruff
man
taciturn
and
caustic
angular
face
swarthy
complexion
a
wholly
puny
thin
figure
ugly
if
a
man
can
be
ugly
with
a
face
so
full
of
intelligence
and
that
was
what
made
this
charming
woman
fall
head
over
heals
that
surprises
you
still
you
me
so
you
have
forgotten
your
adventure
with
la
deschamps
and
the
profound
despair
into
which
you
fell
when
this
creature
closed
her
doors
to
you
drop
it
continue
i
had
said
to
you
she
is
very
beautiful
and
you
answered
sadly
she
has
a
good
personality
she
is
so
it
is
her
talents
that
sway
you
she
has
but
and
this
rare
sublime
marvelous
talent
is
to
make
me
happier
in
her
arms
than
i
have
ever
been
with
any
other
but
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
the
good
sensible
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
secretly
counted
on
by
instinct
unbeknownst
to
him
the
good
fortune
that
you
once
knew
and
which
made
you
say
of
la
deschamps
this
unfortunate
girl
if
this
despicable
woman
insists
on
kicking
me
out
i
will
grab
a
gun
and
blow
my
brains
out
in
her
you
said
that
correct
i
said
it
and
even
now
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
not
do
it
admit
it
then
i
will
admit
to
anything
if
it
pleases
you
my
friend
the
wisest
amongst
us
is
much
happier
not
having
encountered
any
woman
beautiful
or
ugly
clever
or
foolish
that
would
drive
him
mad
enough
for
the
we
men
complain
a
great
deal
we
criticize
them
occasionally
we
watch
the
years
go
by
like
so
many
moments
carried
off
by
the
evil
that
shadows
us
and
we
only
think
to
cower
at
the
strength
of
certain
natural
attractions
especially
those
of
us
with
sensitive
souls
or
ardent
imaginations
the
spark
that
alights
by
chance
on
a
powder
keg
does
not
produce
so
terrible
an
effect
the
finger
ready
to
light
the
fatal
spark
over
you
or
me
is
perhaps
raised
wanting
to
speed
up
his
project
greatly
overworked
his
colleagues
health
suffered
for
it
to
lighten
his
load
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
learned
hebrew
and
while
her
lover
rested
she
spent
a
portion
of
the
night
translating
and
transcribing
bits
of
hebrew
it
came
time
to
tackle
the
greek
authors
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
rushed
to
perfect
her
then
superficial
knowledge
of
this
language
while
gardeil
slept
she
was
busy
translating
and
copying
passages
of
xenophon
and
thucydides
she
added
italian
and
english
to
her
knowledge
of
greek
and
hebrew
her
english
was
so
good
that
she
could
translate
first
essays
on
metaphysics
into
french
a
work
whose
difficult
subject
matter
added
infinitely
to
the
difficulty
of
the
idiom
when
study
exhausted
her
resources
she
amused
herself
by
writing
music
when
she
feared
her
lover
might
be
overcome
with
ennui
she
sang
i
am
not
exaggerating
anything
as
can
be
attested
to
by
le
camus
doctor
of
medicine
who
consoled
her
when
she
was
troubled
and
cared
for
her
when
she
was
in
need
who
remained
by
her
side
in
the
attic
that
her
poverty
had
relegated
her
to
and
who
closed
her
eyes
when
she
died
but
i
am
forgetting
one
of
her
first
misfortunes
the
persecution
that
she
had
to
suffer
at
the
hands
of
a
family
outraged
by
the
scandalous
and
public
relationship
both
truth
and
lies
were
employed
to
dispose
of
her
liberty
in
a
humiliating
manner
priests
and
her
parents
pursued
her
from
quarter
to
quarter
from
house
to
house
for
many
years
reducing
her
to
a
solitary
and
hidden
life
she
spent
her
days
working
for
gardeil
we
visited
her
at
night
and
in
the
presence
of
her
lover
all
her
grief
all
her
worries
vanished
my
word
young
timorous
tenderhearted
in
the
face
of
so
many
difficulties
what
a
happy
being
happy
yes
she
only
ceased
to
be
so
when
gardeil
was
revoltingly
ungrateful
but
it
is
not
possible
for
ingratitude
to
be
the
reward
for
so
many
exceptional
qualities
so
many
signs
of
affection
so
many
sacrifices
of
every
kind
you
are
mistaken
gardeil
was
ungrateful
one
day
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
without
honor
without
support
i
assure
you
i
stayed
with
her
for
some
time
doctor
le
camus
stayed
with
her
always
men
who
are
you
talking
about
gardeil
you
see
the
villain
and
you
do
not
see
the
good
man
right
beside
him
that
painful
and
hopeless
day
she
rushed
to
my
quarters
it
was
morning
she
was
pale
as
death
though
she
had
only
discovered
her
predicament
the
day
before
she
looked
like
one
who
had
been
suffering
for
a
long
time
she
was
not
crying
but
one
could
see
that
she
had
cried
a
lot
she
threw
herself
into
an
armchair
she
did
not
speak
she
could
not
speak
she
held
out
her
arms
to
me
as
she
cried
out
is
it
i
asked
her
he
died
is
worse
he
no
longer
loves
me
he
is
leaving
me
go
on
then
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
i
see
her
i
listen
to
her
and
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
no
longer
loves
you
is
abandoning
you
yes
after
all
that
i
have
done
monsieur
my
mind
is
troubled
have
pity
on
me
do
not
leave
me
above
all
else
do
not
leave
me
while
uttering
these
words
she
had
hold
of
my
arm
she
was
squeezing
it
tightly
as
if
near
her
lay
someone
who
threatened
to
tear
her
away
and
carry
her
off
no
fear
fear
only
do
you
need
save
me
from
myself
he
no
longer
loves
me
i
tire
him
i
annoy
him
i
bore
him
he
hates
me
he
is
abandoning
me
he
is
leaving
me
he
is
leaving
me
this
echoed
line
was
followed
by
a
profound
silence
and
following
this
silence
convulsive
bursts
of
laughter
a
thousand
times
more
terrifying
than
the
fits
of
despair
or
the
groans
of
agony
next
came
tears
cries
inarticulate
words
gazes
turned
towards
the
sky
trembling
lips
a
torrent
of
pain
that
one
must
let
run
its
course
which
i
did
i
only
began
to
address
her
reasoning
when
i
saw
that
her
soul
was
broken
and
stunned
so
i
resumed
hates
you
he
is
leaving
you
and
who
told
you
that
mademoiselle
a
little
hope
and
courage
this
is
no
monster
do
not
know
him
you
will
know
him
this
is
a
monster
like
no
other
like
none
there
ever
can
not
believe
will
see
for
he
love
another
have
not
caused
him
any
suspicion
any
dissatisfaction
is
it
then
uselessness
i
have
nothing
left
i
am
no
longer
good
at
anything
his
ambition
he
has
always
been
ambitious
the
loss
of
my
health
of
my
beauty
i
have
suffered
so
much
and
am
so
tired
boredom
cease
to
be
lovers
but
remain
have
become
an
unbearable
object
my
presence
weighs
on
him
the
sight
of
me
troubles
and
offends
him
if
you
only
knew
what
he
said
to
me
yes
monsieur
he
told
me
that
if
he
was
condemned
to
spend
hours
with
me
he
would
throw
himself
from
the
this
aversion
is
not
the
work
of
a
do
i
know
he
is
by
nature
so
scornful
so
uncaring
so
cold
it
is
difficult
to
see
into
the
depths
of
his
heart
and
it
is
so
awful
to
read
his
death
sentence
he
pronounced
it
to
me
and
with
such
harshness
can
not
imagine
anything
like
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
and
that
is
why
i
came
here
will
you
grant
it
to
me
you
he
respects
you
you
know
what
he
owes
me
perhaps
he
will
not
be
embarrassed
to
show
his
true
self
to
you
no
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
his
guard
up
i
am
only
a
woman
and
you
are
a
man
a
kind
honest
and
just
man
inspires
respect
you
will
inspire
respect
in
him
give
me
your
hands
do
not
say
no
accompany
me
over
to
his
house
i
want
to
speak
to
him
with
you
there
who
knows
what
effect
my
pain
and
your
presence
will
have
on
him
you
will
accompany
me
us
go
i
am
worried
that
her
pain
and
presence
will
leave
things
exactly
as
they
are
contempt
contempt
is
a
terrible
thing
in
a
relationship
and
for
a
woman
i
sent
her
to
seek
out
a
litter
as
she
was
hardly
in
a
state
to
walk
we
arrive
at
gardeil
at
this
huge
new
house
the
only
one
on
the
right
side
of
hyacinthe
street
when
coming
from
square
the
porters
stop
they
open
the
doors
i
wait
she
does
not
get
out
i
lean
over
and
i
see
a
woman
seized
with
a
universal
trembling
her
teeth
were
chattering
as
if
from
feverish
chills
her
knees
were
hitting
together
moment
monsieur
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
what
can
i
do
here
i
will
have
torn
you
from
your
affairs
for
nothing
i
am
so
sorry
i
ask
your
forgiveness
but
i
held
out
my
hand
to
her
she
took
it
she
tried
to
get
up
she
could
not
more
moment
monsieur
she
told
me
am
such
a
bother
i
am
a
burden
to
at
last
she
pulled
herself
together
and
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
she
added
softly
need
to
go
in
we
have
to
see
him
who
knows
perhaps
i
will
die
there
across
the
courtyard
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
in
gardeil
office
he
was
at
his
desk
in
his
dressing
gown
and
bonnet
he
waved
hello
to
me
and
continued
the
work
he
had
started
then
he
came
over
to
me
and
said
must
admit
monsieur
that
women
are
an
inconvenience
i
apologize
a
thousand
times
for
the
extravagances
of
then
he
addressed
himself
to
the
poor
creature
who
was
more
dead
than
alive
he
said
to
her
more
do
you
want
from
me
it
seems
to
me
that
after
explaining
myself
to
you
in
so
clear
and
precise
a
manner
everything
should
be
settled
between
us
i
told
you
that
i
no
longer
loved
you
i
told
you
that
person
to
person
apparently
your
plan
is
for
me
to
repeat
it
to
you
in
front
of
this
gentleman
well
mademoiselle
i
do
not
love
you
anymore
extinguished
in
my
heart
is
this
feeling
of
love
for
you
and
i
will
add
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
for
any
tell
me
why
you
no
longer
love
idea
all
i
know
is
that
i
started
without
knowing
why
that
i
stopped
without
knowing
why
and
that
i
feel
it
is
impossible
for
this
passion
to
return
it
was
a
childish
pursuit
of
which
i
believe
myself
to
be
and
congratulate
myself
for
being
completely
are
my
faults
have
have
no
secret
complaint
with
my
behavior
the
least
you
have
been
the
most
loyal
decent
kind
woman
a
man
could
i
overlooked
anything
it
is
within
my
power
to
do
i
not
sacrificed
my
parents
for
you
is
am
sorry
for
health
may
honor
my
reputation
my
sleep
pleases
you
find
me
odious
is
difficult
to
say
difficult
to
hear
but
since
it
is
so
it
has
to
be
finds
me
odious
i
know
it
and
do
not
respect
myself
any
more
for
it
odious
oh
god
at
these
words
a
mortal
pallor
spread
across
her
face
her
lips
lost
their
color
drops
of
cold
sweat
forming
on
her
cheeks
mixed
with
tears
descendeding
from
her
eyes
they
were
closed
her
head
fell
on
the
back
of
her
armchair
her
teeth
clenched
all
her
limbs
were
quivering
the
quivering
was
followed
by
a
fainting
spell
that
seemed
due
to
the
apprehension
that
she
had
worked
up
at
the
door
to
the
house
the
duration
of
this
state
frightened
me
i
took
her
mantelet
from
her
i
loosened
the
strings
of
her
dress
and
petticoat
and
splashed
a
bit
of
cold
water
on
her
face
her
eyes
opened
halfway
one
could
hear
a
muffled
murmuring
in
her
throat
she
was
trying
to
say
i
am
odious
to
you
she
only
articulated
the
last
syllables
of
the
phrase
then
issued
a
piercing
cry
her
eyelids
lowered
and
the
fainting
spell
began
again
gardeil
seated
coldly
on
his
armchair
his
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
head
rested
on
his
hand
watched
her
without
emotion
and
left
it
to
me
to
care
for
her
i
told
him
repeatedly
monsieur
she
is
dying
we
have
to
call
for
he
answered
me
by
smiling
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
lead
a
hard
life
they
do
not
die
over
such
a
little
thing
as
this
this
will
pass
you
do
not
know
them
very
well
their
bodies
do
whatever
they
want
them
to
is
dying
i
tell
her
body
was
as
if
without
strength
or
life
it
slipped
away
from
the
top
of
the
armchair
and
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
to
the
left
or
right
had
i
not
been
holding
her
meanwhile
gardeil
rose
up
brusquely
and
pacing
his
apartment
said
with
an
impatient
and
moody
tone
could
do
without
this
dismal
scene
i
do
hope
this
will
be
the
last
who
the
devil
does
she
bear
a
grudge
against
i
loved
her
i
will
smash
my
head
into
a
brick
wall
if
that
is
the
least
bit
false
i
do
not
love
her
anymore
she
knows
that
now
or
she
will
never
know
it
everything
has
been
said
monsieur
everything
has
not
been
said
what
you
believe
that
a
good
man
has
only
to
strip
a
woman
of
everything
she
has
and
leave
her
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
am
begging
as
much
as
she
do
i
want
you
to
do
to
associate
your
misery
with
the
one
that
you
have
reduced
her
enjoyed
saying
that
she
would
be
no
better
for
it
and
i
would
be
much
would
act
like
this
to
a
friend
that
has
sacrificed
everything
for
you
friend
a
friend
i
do
not
have
much
faith
in
friends
and
this
experience
has
taught
me
to
have
no
passion
for
them
i
am
frustrated
that
i
did
not
realize
this
it
is
right
that
this
unfortunate
woman
should
be
the
victim
of
your
what
is
to
say
that
one
month
a
day
later
i
would
not
have
been
just
as
cruelly
the
error
of
is
to
say
everything
that
she
has
done
for
you
and
the
state
that
you
see
her
she
did
for
me
by
god
he
is
fully
acquitted
by
the
loss
of
my
monsieur
gardeil
what
a
comparison
between
your
time
and
all
the
priceless
things
that
you
have
taken
from
her
have
done
nothing
i
am
nothing
i
am
thirty
years
old
it
is
time
to
think
of
myself
now
or
never
and
to
treat
all
this
nonsense
like
it
is
meanwhile
the
poor
woman
was
coming
to
a
little
bit
at
these
last
words
she
regained
enough
energy
did
he
say
about
the
loss
of
his
time
i
learned
four
languages
to
ease
his
workload
i
read
a
thousand
volumes
i
wrote
translated
copied
day
and
night
i
exhausted
myself
wore
out
my
eyes
boiled
my
blood
i
came
down
with
an
awful
illness
from
which
i
may
never
recover
he
does
not
dare
tell
you
the
cause
of
his
displeasure
but
you
will
at
that
instant
she
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
withdrew
one
of
her
arms
from
her
dress
bared
one
of
her
shoulders
and
showing
me
an
erysipelatus
mark
reason
for
his
transformation
there
it
is
she
said
to
me
it
is
there
is
the
effect
of
those
sleepless
nights
it
came
one
morning
with
these
rolls
of
parchment
he
told
me
is
very
anxious
to
know
what
is
in
these
this
work
has
to
be
done
by
tomorrow
and
it
was
at
that
moment
we
heard
steps
coming
towards
the
door
it
was
a
servant
announcing
arrival
face
went
pale
i
invited
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
to
withdraw
and
tidy
herself
up
she
said
i
am
staying
i
want
this
disgrace
uncovered
i
will
wait
for
i
will
speak
to
what
good
will
that
do
she
answered
me
are
you
will
regret
it
leave
him
his
evil
deeds
it
is
a
revenge
worthy
of
is
it
worthy
of
him
do
you
not
see
that
this
man
here
is
not
go
monsieur
let
us
leave
now
for
i
can
neither
answer
for
what
i
would
do
nor
for
what
i
would
say
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
had
repaired
the
disorder
this
scene
had
made
of
her
clothes
and
raced
from
of
office
i
followed
and
heard
the
door
slam
shut
behind
her
i
later
learned
that
someone
had
given
notice
to
the
porter
i
conducted
myself
to
her
quarters
where
i
found
doctor
le
camus
waiting
for
us
the
passion
that
he
felt
for
this
young
woman
differed
little
from
hers
for
gardeil
i
recounted
our
visit
to
him
and
while
i
spoke
the
signs
of
his
anger
pain
indignation
it
was
not
too
difficult
to
see
from
his
face
that
your
failure
did
not
displease
him
all
that
much
it
is
true
there
is
man
for
you
he
is
no
better
than
that
this
rupture
was
followed
by
a
violent
sickness
during
which
time
the
good
honest
tender
and
kind
doctor
gave
her
such
a
treatment
he
would
not
have
reserved
for
the
noblest
woman
in
france
he
came
three
four
times
a
day
in
spite
of
the
peril
he
slept
in
her
room
on
a
bed
it
is
fortunate
that
this
was
only
a
disease
of
the
heart
in
returning
to
us
she
drifts
away
from
her
memories
of
others
and
then
she
has
a
pretext
to
be
troubled
without
indiscretion
or
constraint
that
thought
otherwise
just
does
not
apply
to
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
during
her
recovery
we
sorted
out
her
schedule
she
had
more
than
enough
spirit
imagination
taste
and
knowledge
to
be
admitted
into
the
académie
des
inscriptions
she
had
listened
to
us
wax
metaphysical
for
so
long
that
the
most
abstract
matters
had
become
familiar
to
her
her
first
literary
endeavor
was
the
translation
of
essays
on
human
understanding
i
proofread
it
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
had
left
me
with
very
little
to
rectify
this
translation
was
printed
in
holland
and
was
well
received
by
the
public
my
letter
on
the
blind
and
the
dumb
appeared
at
almost
the
same
time
she
raised
some
very
perceptive
objections
which
gave
rise
to
an
addition
dedicated
to
her
i
have
done
worse
things
than
make
this
addition
mademoiselle
de
la
happiness
had
been
somewhat
restored
the
doctor
cooked
for
us
occasionally
and
these
dinners
were
not
too
sorrowful
since
estrangement
le
passion
had
made
marvelous
strides
one
day
at
the
table
during
dessert
as
he
was
expressing
it
with
all
the
honesty
sensitivity
and
naïveté
of
a
child
she
said
to
him
with
a
sincerity
that
pleased
me
greatly
but
which
will
perhaps
displease
others
it
would
be
impossible
to
heighten
the
respect
i
have
for
you
your
kindnesses
fulfill
me
and
i
would
be
as
gloomy
as
the
monster
of
hyacinthe
street
were
i
not
steeped
in
the
fiercest
gratitude
you
tell
me
of
your
passion
with
such
grace
and
sensitivity
that
i
would
be
i
think
angry
if
you
were
to
stop
just
the
idea
of
losing
your
company
or
of
being
deprived
of
your
friendship
is
enough
to
make
me
miserable
you
are
a
good
man
if
there
ever
was
one
your
goodness
and
sweetness
of
character
is
incomparable
i
do
not
believe
that
a
heart
can
fall
into
better
hands
i
appeal
to
my
own
from
morning
till
night
in
your
favor
but
appeal
in
vain
to
that
which
does
not
desire
it
i
am
not
making
any
more
progress
meanwhile
you
will
suffer
and
so
i
feel
a
vicious
pain
i
do
not
know
anyone
more
worthy
of
the
happiness
that
you
seek
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
would
not
do
to
make
you
happy
anything
is
possible
without
exception
i
mean
doctor
i
would
yes
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
sleep
so
far
as
to
include
that
do
you
want
to
sleep
with
me
you
only
have
to
say
so
that
is
all
i
can
do
for
you
but
you
want
to
be
loved
and
i
do
not
know
a
the
doctor
listened
to
her
took
her
by
the
hand
and
kissed
it
wet
it
with
tears
and
i
i
did
not
know
whether
i
should
laugh
or
cry
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
knew
the
doctor
well
the
next
day
i
said
to
her
mademoiselle
if
the
doctor
had
said
the
word
she
answered
would
have
kept
my
promise
but
that
would
never
have
happened
my
offers
were
not
of
the
sort
that
would
be
accepted
by
a
man
like
him
not
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
in
his
position
i
would
have
simply
hoped
that
the
rest
would
but
if
you
were
in
his
position
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
would
not
have
made
you
the
same
the
hume
translation
had
not
made
her
very
much
money
the
dutch
will
print
anything
provided
they
do
not
pay
for
it
lucky
for
us
given
all
the
restrictions
we
place
on
thought
in
our
country
if
they
even
once
decided
to
pay
the
authors
they
would
bring
the
entire
book
industry
to
their
doorstep
we
advised
her
to
write
a
light
read
one
that
would
bring
her
more
profit
than
respect
she
worked
for
four
or
five
months
at
which
point
she
brought
me
a
short
historical
fiction
entitled
the
three
favorites
it
had
a
deftness
of
style
finesse
and
earnestness
but
without
her
having
realized
it
for
she
was
incapable
of
any
malice
it
was
scattered
with
a
multitude
of
details
applicable
to
the
mistress
the
marquise
of
pompadour
and
i
did
not
conceal
from
her
the
fact
that
whatever
the
sacrifice
whether
it
be
in
softening
or
removing
these
sections
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
her
work
to
appear
without
compromising
her
and
that
the
unhappiness
of
spoiling
such
a
good
thing
would
not
guarantee
her
another
she
sensed
the
truth
in
my
observation
and
became
only
more
distressed
the
good
doctor
predicted
all
her
needs
but
she
accepted
his
charity
with
all
the
more
reservation
as
she
felt
herself
less
disposed
to
the
sort
of
gratitude
that
he
hoped
to
receive
from
her
besides
the
doctor
was
not
wealthy
then
and
he
was
not
particularly
in
a
position
to
become
wealthy
from
time
to
time
she
took
her
manuscript
from
its
folder
and
said
to
me
sadly
there
is
no
way
to
make
anything
of
this
it
will
have
to
remain
i
gave
her
some
singular
advice
send
the
work
as
is
without
toning
it
down
or
altering
it
to
madame
de
pompadour
herself
with
a
postscript
explaining
the
delivery
this
idea
pleased
her
she
wrote
a
charming
letter
on
all
counts
but
most
importantly
with
a
tone
of
sincerity
to
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
no
two
or
three
months
passed
with
no
word
and
she
had
deemed
the
attempt
fruitless
until
a
cross
came
to
her
home
with
a
letter
from
the
marquise
the
work
was
given
the
praise
it
merited
she
was
thanked
for
her
sacrifice
a
market
was
acknowledged
no
offense
was
taken
and
the
author
was
invited
to
come
to
versailles
where
she
would
find
a
gracious
woman
disposed
to
give
the
help
that
depended
on
her
as
he
was
leaving
mademoiselle
de
la
home
the
envoy
left
a
roll
of
fifty
louis
smoothly
on
her
mantelpiece
the
doctor
and
i
urged
her
to
take
advantage
of
madame
de
good
will
but
we
were
working
with
a
girl
whose
modesty
and
shyness
matched
her
merit
how
to
present
oneself
there
in
rags
the
doctor
raised
this
concern
immediately
after
clothing
there
were
other
excuses
and
then
still
more
the
voyage
to
versailles
was
deferred
from
day
to
day
until
it
was
almost
inappropriate
to
go
through
with
it
it
had
already
been
some
time
since
we
had
spoken
to
her
about
it
when
the
same
emissary
returned
with
a
second
letter
filled
with
the
kindest
reproaches
and
another
bonus
offered
with
the
same
gentleness
as
the
first
this
generous
act
of
madame
de
pompadour
has
never
been
discovered
i
spoke
of
it
to
collin
her
confidant
and
distributor
of
her
secret
favors
he
had
not
heard
of
it
and
i
like
to
think
that
it
is
not
the
only
one
that
her
tomb
contains
it
was
thus
that
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
twice
missed
the
opportunity
to
pull
herself
from
poverty
she
later
moved
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
i
entirely
lost
track
of
her
from
what
i
have
learned
of
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
had
become
nothing
but
a
fabric
of
grief
infirmity
and
misery
the
doors
of
her
family
were
obstinately
closed
to
her
in
vain
she
solicited
the
intercession
of
the
saintly
folk
that
had
persecuted
her
with
so
much
zeal
according
to
custom
the
doctor
did
not
abandon
her
she
died
on
straw
in
an
attic
while
the
little
tiger
on
hyacinthe
street
the
only
lover
that
she
had
had
practiced
medicine
in
montpellier
or
toulouse
and
in
the
greatest
comfort
enjoyed
his
reputation
as
a
clever
man
and
his
usurped
reputation
as
a
decent
man
but
this
is
still
more
or
less
according
to
custom
if
there
is
a
good
and
honest
tanié
providence
sends
him
to
a
reymer
if
there
is
a
good
and
honest
la
chaux
she
will
come
to
be
shared
by
a
gardeil
so
that
everything
happens
for
the
best
one
might
answer
that
it
is
rash
to
make
so
definitive
a
pronouncement
on
the
character
of
a
man
based
on
a
single
act
that
a
rule
so
severe
would
reduce
the
number
of
good
men
on
earth
to
less
than
the
christian
gospel
admits
as
elect
in
heaven
that
one
can
be
fickle
in
love
even
claim
little
devotion
to
women
without
being
deprived
of
honor
or
probity
that
one
is
in
control
neither
of
suppressing
a
passion
that
flares
up
nor
of
prolonging
one
that
is
ending
that
there
are
already
enough
men
in
the
streets
and
houses
that
are
fully
worthy
of
the
name
scoundrel
without
inventing
imaginary
crimes
that
multiply
them
to
infinity
one
might
ask
whether
i
have
not
betrayed
or
deceived
or
abandoned
a
woman
without
mentioning
it
if
i
desired
to
respond
to
these
questions
my
answers
would
not
linger
without
retort
and
it
would
be
a
dispute
that
would
last
till
judgment
day
but
lay
hands
on
your
conscience
and
tell
me
you
sir
apologist
of
the
unfaithful
and
the
deceivers
if
you
would
take
the
doctor
from
toulouse
as
your
friend
you
hesitate
everything
is
said
and
i
hereupon
ask
god
to
take
under
his
holy
protection
every
woman
to
whom
it
will
take
your
fancy
to
pay
your
respects

account

follows

and

literally

diderot
adds
nothing
either
to
the
events
or
to
the
temperaments
of
the
characters
he
introduces
mademoiselle
de
la
passion
for
gardeil
the
monstrous
ingratitude
of
her
lover
the
details
of
her
meeting
with
him
of
their
conversation
in
presence
who
had
accompanied
her
to
the
house
of
this
ferocious
beast

hopelessness
touching
this
betrayed
woman
abandoned
by
him
for
which
she
had
sacrificed
her
sleep
her
fortune
her
reputation
her
health
and
even
the
charms
by
which
she
seduced
him
all
this
is
of
the
greatest
exactness
as
diderot
knew
the
actors
in
this
drama
particularly
well
for
the
facts
he
had
been
witness
to
or
the
friendship
that
had
entrusted
him
with
them
were
still
recent
when
he
resolved
to
record
them
his
imagination
had
not
had
the
time
to
alter
them
by
adding
or
subtracting
some
circumstance
to
produce
a
greater
effect
and
here
again
is
one
of
the
fairly
rare
accounts
of
his
life
where
he
says
only
what
has
seen
and
has
seen
only
what
was
as
for
the
curious
particularities
that
he
recorded
from
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
and
that
he
documented
in
his
writing
i
will
add
only
a
single
fact
that
he
omitted
through
forgetfulness
and
that
was
worthy
of
being
conserved
that
this
so
tender
so
passionate
so
interesting
by
her
extreme
sensibility
and
by
her
misfortunes
above
all
so
worthy
of
a
better
fate
had
also
been
friends
with
and
the
abbot
de
condillac
she
was
in
a
position
to
hear
and
assess
the
works
of
these
two
philosophers
she
had
even
given
the
latter
essay
on
the
origin
of
human
knowledge
she
had
read
the
very
wise
advice
of
returning
to
his
first
thoughts
and
if
i
may
use
the
expression
to
begin
at
the
beginning
the
reject
with
hobbes
the
absurd
hypothesis
of
a
distinction
between
two
substances
in
man
i
dare
say
that
this
very
philosophical
view
this
sole
idea
of
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
suggests
more
breadth
depth
and
accuracy
in
her
mind
that
the
whole
of
metaphysics
in
which
there
is
in
effect
a
radical
and
destructive
vice
that
affects
the
entire
system
and
yields
more
or
less
vague
and
uncertain
results
one
sees
that
mademoiselle
de
la
chaux
sensed
this
and
one
regrets
that
condillac
more
docile
to
the
judicious
advice
of
this
enlightened
woman
with
uncommon
insight
did
not
follow
the
route
that
she
pointed
him
towards
he
would
not
have
scattered
so
many
errors
over
the
one
he
decided
upon
and
upon
which
one
can
only
run
astray
as
happens
daily
to
those
that
take
him
as
their
guide
see
on
this
philosopher
the
preliminary
reflections
that
serve
as
an
introduction
to
his
article
in
the
methodical
encyclopedia
dictionary
of
ancient
and
modern
philosophy

and
what
i
have

historical
and
philosophical
memoires

life
and

curious
dissertations
