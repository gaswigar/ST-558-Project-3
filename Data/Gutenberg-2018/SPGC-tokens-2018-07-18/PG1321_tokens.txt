anyone

tiresias
although
a
mere
spectator
and
not
indeed
a
character
is
yet
the
most
important
personage
in
the
poem
uniting
all
the
rest
just
as
the
merchant
seller
of
currants
melts
into
the
phoenician
sailor
and
the
latter
is
not
wholly
distinct
from
ferdinand
prince
of

so
all
the

are
one

and
the
two

meet
in

what
tiresias
in

is
the
substance
of

the
