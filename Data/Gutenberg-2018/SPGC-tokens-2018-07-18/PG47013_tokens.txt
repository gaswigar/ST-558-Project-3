the

of
this
book
explains
its
plan
and
purpose
the
courses
of
reading
and
the
schemes
for

study
herein
indicated
are
the
outgrowth
of
the
author
s
long
experience
as
a
lover
of
books
and
director
of
reading
they
have
been
tested
and
found
to
be
all
that
is
claimed
for
them
as
to
the
large
number
of
quotations
in
the
first
part
of
the
book
they
are
given
in
the
belief
that
in
a
multitude
of
counsels
there
is
and
the
author
finds
consolation
and
encouragement
in
the
following
words
of
emerson
we
are
as
much
informed
of
a
writer
s
genius
by
what
he
selects
as
by
what
he
originates
we
read
the
quotation
with
his
eyes
and
find
a
new
and
fervent
as
the
value
of
the
most
useful
inventions
depends
upon
the
ingenious
placing
of
their
parts
so
the
originality
of
this
work
may
be
found
to
lie
chiefly
in
its
arrangement
yet
the
writer
confidently
believes
that
his
readers
will
enjoy
that
which
he
has
borrowed
and
possibly
find
aid
and
encouragement
in
that
which
he
claims
as
his
own
and
therefore
this
book
is
sent
out
with
the
hope
that
will
find
in
it
a
safe

prelude
in
praise
of
books
let
us
consider
how
great
a
commodity
of
doctrine
exists
in
books
how
easily
how
secretly
how
safely
they
expose
the
nakedness
of
human
ignorance
without
putting
it
to
shame
these
are
the
masters
who
instruct
us
without
rods
and
ferules
without
hard
words
and
anger
without
clothes
or
money
if
you
approach
them
they
are
not
asleep
if
investigating
you
interrogate
them
they
conceal
nothing
if
you
mistake
them
they
never
grumble
if
you
are
ignorant
they
can
not
laugh
at
you
you
only
o
books
are
liberal
and
independent
you
give
to
all
who
ask
and
enfranchise
all
who
serve
you
assiduously
truly
you
are
the
ears
filled
with
most
palatable
grains
you
are
golden
urns
in
which
manna
is
laid
up
rocks
flowing
with
honey
or
rather
indeed
honeycombs
udders
most
copiously
yielding
the
milk
of
life
ever
full
the
river
of
paradise
where
the
human
mind
is
fed
and
the
arid
intellect
moistened
and
watered
fruitful
olives
vines
of
engaddi
knowing
no
sterility
burning
lamps
to
be
ever
held
in
the
hand
the
library
therefore
of
wisdom
is
more
precious
than
all
riches
and
nothing
that
can
be
wished
for
is
worthy
to
be
compared
with
it
whosoever
acknowledges
himself
to
be
a
zealous
follower
of
truth
of
happiness
of
wisdom
of
science
or
even
of
the
faith
must
of
necessity
make
himself

lover

books
richard

books
are
friends
whose
society
is
extremely
agreeable
to
me
they
are
of
all
ages
and
of
every
country
they
have
distinguished
themselves
both
in
the
cabinet
and
in
the
field
and
obtained
high
honors
for
their
knowledge
of
the
sciences
it
is
easy
to
gain
access
to
them
for
they
are
always
at
my
service
and
i
admit
them
to
my
company
and
dismiss
them
from
it
whenever
i
please
they
are
never
troublesome
but
immediately
answer
every
question
i
ask
them
some
relate
to
me
the
events
of
past
ages
while
others
reveal
to
me
the
secrets
of
nature
some
teach
me
how
to
live
and
others
how
to
die
some
by
their
vivacity
drive
away
my
cares
and
exhilarate
my
spirits
while
others
give
fortitude
to
my
mind
and
teach
me
the
important
lesson
how
to
restrain
my
desires
and
to
depend
wholly
on
myself
they
open
to
me
in
short
the
various
avenues
of
all
the
arts
and
sciences
and
upon
their
information
i
safely
rely
in
all
emergencies
in
return
for
all
these
services
they
only
ask
me
to
accommodate
them
with
a
convenient
chamber
in
some
corner
of
my
humble
habitation
where
they
may
repose
in
peace
for
these
friends
are
more
delighted
by
the
tranquility
of
retirement
than
with

john

books
are
a
guide
in
youth
and
an
entertainment
for
age
they
support
us
under
solitude
and
keep
us
from
being
a
burden
to
ourselves
they
help
us
to
forget
the
crossness
of
men
and
things
compose
our
cares
and
our
passions
and
lay
our
disappointments
asleep
when
we
are
weary
of
the
living
we
may
repair
to
the
dead
who
have
nothing
of
peevishness
pride
or
design
in
their
conversation
jeremy
collier
god
be
thanked
for
books
they
are
the
voices
of
the

dead
and
make
us
heirs
of
the
spiritual
life
of
past
ages
books
are
the
true
levellers
they
give
to
all
who
will
faithfully
use
them
the
society
the
spiritual
presence
of
the
best
and
greatest
of
our
race
no
matter
how
poor
i
am
no
matter
though
the
prosperous
of
my
own
time
will
not
enter
my
obscure
dwelling
if
the
sacred
writers
will
enter
and
take
up
their
abode
under
my
roof
milton
will
cross
my
threshold
to
sing
to
me

of

like

then

field
like

tree
let
me
rather
say
it
stands
from
year

year
and
from
age

have
books
that
already
number
some
hundred

chosen
the
more
select
the
more

and
like
these
are

often

the
precedence

friends
tire

moods
they
frankly
declare
the
author

mind
without
giving
offence
like
living
friends
they
too
have
their
voice
and
physiognomies
and
their
company
is
prized
as
old

them

have

company
of
the
wisest
and
wittiest
men
that
could
be
picked
out
of

civil
countries
in

thousand
years
have
set
in

the
results
of
their
learning

wisdom
the
men
themselves
were
hid

inaccessible
solitary
impatient
of
interruption
fenced
by
etiquette
but
the
thought
which
they
did
not
uncover
to
their
bosom

is
here
written
out
in
transparent
words
to
us
the
strangers
of
another
age
we
owe
to
books
those
general
benefits
which
come
from
high
intellectual
action
thus
i
think
we
often
owe
to
them
the
perception
of
immortality
they
impart
sympathetic
activity
to
the
moral
power
go
with
mean
people
and
you
think

is

the

is

place
peopled
with
men
of
positive
quality
with
heroes
and
standing
around
us
who
will
not
let

they
address

book
that

what
is

great
love
of
books
it
is
something
like

great
and

men
of
all
past
times
books
it
is
true
are
silent
as
you
see
them
on
their
shelves
but
silent
as
they
are
when
i
enter
a
library
i
feel
as
if
almost
the
dead
were
present
and
i
know
if
i
put
questions
to
these
books
they
will
answer
me
with
all
the
faithfulness
and
fulness
which
has
been
left
in
them
by
the
great
men
who
have
left
the
books
with
us

books
are
our
household
gods
and
we
can
not
prize
them
too
highly
they
are
the
only
gods
in
all
the
mythologies
that
are
beautiful
and
unchangeable
for
they
betray
no
man
and
love
their
lovers
i
confess
myself
an
idolater
of
this
literary
religion
and
am
grateful
for
the
blessed
ministry
of
books
it
is
a
kind
of
heathenism
which
needs
no
missionary
funds
no
bible
even
to
abolish
it
for
the
bible
itself
caps
the
peak
of
this

olympus

crowns
it
with
sublimity
and
glory
amongst
the
many
things
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
as
the
result
of
modern
discoveries
surely
this
of
printed
books
is
the
highest
of
all
and
i
for
one
am
so
sensible
of
its
merits
that
i

chapter
i
on
the
choice
of
books
the
choice
of
books
is
not
the
least
part
of
the
duty
of
a
scholar
if
he
would
become
a
man
and
worthy
to
deal
with
manlike
things
he
must
read
only
the
bravest
and
noblest
books
forged
at
the
heart
and
fashioned
by
the
intellect
of
a
godlike
searle
the
most
important
question
for
you
to
ask
yourself
be
you
teacher
or
scholar
is
this
what
books
shall
i
read
for
him
who
has
inclination
to
read
there
is
no
dearth
of
reading
matter
and
it
is
obtainable
almost
for
the
asking
books
are
in
a
manner
thrust
upon
you
almost
daily
shall
you
read
without
discrimination
whatever
comes
most
readily
to
hand
as
well
say
that
you
will
accept
as
a
friend
and
companion
every
man
whom
you
meet
on
the
street
shall
you
read
even
every
good
book
that
comes
in
your
way
simply
because
it
is
harmless
and
interesting
it
is
not
every
harmless
book
nor
indeed
every
good
book
that
will
make
your
mind
the
richer
for
the
reading
of
it
never
perhaps
has
the
right
choice
of
books
been
more
difficult
than
at
present
and
never
did
it
behoove
more
strongly
both
teachers
and
scholars
to
look
well
to
the
character
of
that
which
they
read
first
then
let
us
consider
what
books
we
are
to
avoid
all
will
agree
that
those
which
are
really
and
absolutely
bad
should
be
shunned
as
we
shun
a
pestilence
in
these
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
is
no
more
prolific
cause
of
evil
than
bad
books
there
are
many
books
so
utterly
vile
that
there
is
no
mistaking
their
character
and
no
question
as
to
whether
they
should
be
avoided
there
are
others
which
are
a
more
dangerous
because
they
come
to
us
disguised
wolves
in
sheep
s
clothing
a
character
of
harmlessness
if
not
of
sanctity
i
have
heard
those
who
ought
to
know
better
laugh
at
the
silly
jokes
of
a
very
silly
book
and
offer
by
way
of
excuse
that
there
was
nothing
bad
in
it
i
have
heard
teachers
recommend
to
their
pupils
reading
matter
which
to
say
the
least
was
of
a
very
doubtful
character
now
the
only
excuse
that
can
be
offered
in
such
cases
is
ignorance
i
didn
t
know
there
was
any
harm
in
the
but
the
teacher
who
through
ignorance
poisons
the
moral
character
and
checks
the
mental
growth
of
his
pupils
is
as
guilty
of
criminal
carelessness
as
the
druggist
s
clerk
who
by
mistake
sells
arsenic
for
quinine
step
down
and
out
of
that
responsible
position
which
you
are
in
no
wise
qualified
to
fill
the
direction
of
the
pupils
habits
of
reading
the
choice
of
reading
matter
for
them
is
by
no
means
the
least
of
the
teacher
s
duties
the
elder
pliny
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
was
accustomed
to
say
that
no
book
was
so
bad
but
that
some
part
of
it
might
be
read
with
profit
this
may
have
been
true
in
pliny
s
time
but
it
is
very
far
from
correct
a
large
number
of
books
and
many
which
attain
an
immense
circulation
are
but
the
embodiment
of
evil
from
beginning
to
end
others
although
not
absolutely
and
aggressively
bad
contain
not
a
single
line
that
can
be
read
with
profit
what
are
the
sure
criterions
of
a
bad
book
there
is
no
better
authority
on
this
subject
than
the
rev
robert
collyer
he
says
if
when
i
read
a
book
about
god
i
find
that
it
has
put
him
farther
from
me
or
about
man
that
it
has
put
me
farther
from
him
or
about
this
universe
that
it
has
shaken
down
upon
it
a
new
look
of
desolation
turning
a
green
field
into
a
wild
moor
or
about
life
that
it
has
made
it
seem
a
little
less
worth
living
on
all
accounts
than
it
was
or
about
moral
principles
that
they
are
not
quite
so
clear
and
strong
as
they
were
when
this
author
began
to
talk
i
know
that
on
any
of
these
five
cardinal
things
in
the
life
of
man
relations
to
god
to
his
fellows
to
the
world
about
him
and
the
world
within
him
and
the
great
principles
on
which
all
things
stable
centre
for
me
is
a
bad
book
it
may
chime
in
with
some
lurking
appetite
in
my
own
nature
and
so
seem
to
be
as
sweet
as
honey
to
my
taste
but
it
comes
to
bitter
bad
results
it
may
be
food
for
another
i
can
say
nothing
to
that
he
may
be
a
pine
while
i
am
a
palm
i
only
know
this
that
in
these
great
first
things
if
the
book
i
read
shall
touch
them
at
all
it
shall
touch
them
to
my
profit
or
i
will
not
read
it
right
and
wrong
shall
grow
more
clear
life
in
and
about
me
more
divine
i
shall
come
nearer
to
my
fellows
and
god
nearer
to
me
or
the
thing
is
a
poison
faust
or
calvin
or
carlyle
if
any
one
of
these
cardinal
things
is
the
grain
and
the
grist
of
the
book
and
that
is
what
it
comes
to
when
i
read
it
i
am
being
drugged
and
poisoned
and
the
sooner
i
know
it
the
better
i
want
bread
and
meat
and
milk
not
brandy
or
opium
or
and
robert
southey
the
poet
expresses
nearly
the
same
thing
young
readers
whose
hearts
are
open
whose
understandings
are
not
yet
hardened
and
whose
feelings
are
not
yet
exhausted
nor
encrusted
with
the
world
from
me
a
better
rule
than
any
professors
of
criticism
will
teach
you
would
you
know
whether
the
tendency
of
a
book
is
good
or
evil
examine
in
what
state
of
mind
you
lay
it
down
has
it
induced
you
to
suspect
that
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
think
unlawful
may
after
all
be
innocent
and
that
may
be
harmless
which
you
have
hitherto
been
taught
to
think
dangerous
has
it
tended
to
make
you
dissatisfied
and
impatient
under
the
control
of
others
and
disposed
you
to
relax
in
that
without
which
both
the
laws
of
god
and
man
tell
us
there
can
be
no
virtue
and
consequently
no
happiness
has
it
attempted
to
abate
your
admiration
and
reverence
for
what
is
great
and
good
and
to
diminish
in
you
the
love
of
your
country
and
your
has
it
addressed
itself
to
your
pride
your
vanity
your
selfishness
or
any
other
of
your
evil
propensities
has
it
defiled
the
imagination
with
what
is
loathsome
and
shocked
the
heart
with
what
is
monstrous
has
it
disturbed
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
which
the
creator
has
implanted
in
the
human
soul
if
so
if
you
are
conscious
of
any
or
all
of
these
effects
or
if
having
escaped
from
all
you
have
felt
that
such
were
the
effects
it
was
intended
to
produce

it

whole
set
though
it
should
be

it
is
the
case
with
literature
as
with
life
says
arthur
schopenhauer
the
german
philosopher
wherever
we
turn
we
come
upon
the
incorrigible
mob
of
humankind
whose
name
is
legion
swarming
everywhere
damaging
everything
as
flies
in
summer
hence
the
multiplicity
of
bad
books
those
exuberant
weeds
of
literature
which
choke
the
true
corn
such
books
rob
the
public
of
time
money
and
attention
which
ought
properly
to
belong
to
good
literature
and
noble
aims
and
they
are
written
with
a
view
merely
to
make
money
or
occupation
they
are
therefore
not
merely
useless
but
injurious
nine
tenths
of
our
current
literature
has
no
other
end
but
to
inveigle
a
thaler
or
two
out
of
the
public
pocket
for
which
purpose
author
publisher
and
printer
are
leagued
together
of
bad
books
we
can
never
read
too
little
of
the
good
never
too
much
the
bad
are
intellectual
poison
and
undermine
the
from
thomas
carlyle
s
inaugural
address
at
edinburgh
on
the
occasion
of
his
installation
as
rector
of
the
university
in
i
quote
the
following
potent
passage
i
do
not
know
whether
it
has
been
sufficiently
brought
home
to
you
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
books
when
a
man
is
reading
on
any
kind
of
subject
in
most
departments
of
books
all
books
if
you
take
it
in
a
wide
sense
will
find
that
there
is
a
division
into
good
books
and
bad
books
everywhere
a
good
kind
of
a
book
and
a
bad
kind
of
a
book
i
am
not
to
assume
that
you
are
unacquainted
or
with
this
plain
fact
but
i
may
remind
you
that
it
is
becoming
a
very
important
consideration
in
our
day
there
is
a
number
a
frightfully
increasing
number
of
books
that
are
decidedly
to
the
readers
of
them
not
useful
but
an
ingenious
reader
will
learn
also
that
a
certain
number
of
books
were
written
by
a
supremely
noble
kind
of
people
not
a
very
great
number
of
books
but
still
a
number
fit
to
occupy
all
your
reading
industry
do
adhere
more
or
less
to
that
side
of
things
in
short
as
i
have
written
it
down
somewhere
else
i
conceive
that
books
are
like
men
s
souls
divided
into
sheep
and
goats
some
few
are
going
up
and
carrying
us
up
heavenward
calculated
i
mean
to
be
of
priceless
advantage
in
teaching
forwarding
the
teaching
of
all
generations
others
a
frightful
multitude
are
going
down
down
doing
ever
the
more
and
the
wider
and
the
wilder
mischief
keep
a
strict
eye
on
that
latter
class
of
books
my
young
friends
speaking
of
those
books
whose
inward
character
and
influence
it
is
hard
at
first
to
discern
john
ruskin
says
avoid
especially
that
class
of
literature
which
has
a
knowing
tone
it
is
the
most
poisonous
of
all
every
good
book
or
piece
of
book
is
full
of
admiration
and
awe
it
may
contain
firm
assertion
or
stern
satire
but
it
never
sneers
coldly
nor
asserts
haughtily
and
it
always
leads
you
to
reverence
or
love
something
with
your
whole
heart
it
is
not
always
easy
to
distinguish
the
satire
of
the
venomous
race
of
books
from
the
satire
of
the
noble
and
pure
ones
but
in
general
you
may
notice
that
the
crustacean
and
batrachian
books
will
sneer
at
sentiment
and
the
human
books
at
sin
much
of
the
literature
of
the
present
day
though
good
to
be
read
by
persons
of
ripe
age
has
a
tendency
to
agitate
rather
than
confirm
and
leaves
its
readers
too
frequently
in
a
helpless
or
hopeless
indignation
the
worst
possible
state
into
which
the
mind
of
youth
can
be
thrown
it
may
indeed
become
necessary
for
you
as
you
advance
in
life
to
set
your
hand
to
things
that
need
to
be
altered
in
the
world
or
apply
your
heart
chiefly
to
what
must
be
pitied
in
it
or
condemned
but
for
a
young
person
the
safest
temper
is
one
of
reverence
and
the
safest
place
one
of
obscurity
certainly
at
present
and
perhaps
through
all
your
life
your
teachers
are
wisest
when
they
make
you
content
in
quiet
virtue
and
that
literature
and
art
are
best
for
you
which
point
out
in
common
life
and
familiar
things
the
objects
for
hopeful
labor
and
for
humble
there
would
be
fewer
bad
books
in
the
world
if
readers
were
properly
informed
and
warned
of
their
character
and
we
may
believe
that
the
really
vicious
books
would
soon
cease
to
exist
if
their
makers
and
publishers
were
popularly
regarded
with
the
same
detestation
as
other
corrupters
of
the
public
morals
he
who
has
published
an
injurious
book
says
robert
south
sins
as
it
were
in
his
very
grave
corrupts
others
while
he
is
rotting
addison
says
much
the
same
thing
writers
of
great
talents
who
employ
their
parts
in
propagating
immorality
and
seasoning
vicious
sentiments
with
wit
and
humor
are
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
pests
of
society
and
the
enemies
of
mankind
they
leave
books
behind
them
to
scatter
infection
and
destroy
their
posterity
they
act
the
counterparts
of
a
confucius
or
a
socrates
and
seem
to
have
been
sent
into
the
world
to
deprave
human
nature
and
sink
it
into
the
condition
of
and
william
cobbett
is
still
more
severe
in
his
denunciation
in
his
advice
to
young
men
he
says
i
hope
that
your
taste
will
keep
you
aloof
from
the
writings
of
those
detestable
villains
who
employ
the
powers
of
their
mind
in
debauching
the
minds
of
others
or
in
endeavors
to
do
it
they
present
their
poison
in
such
captivating
forms
that
it
requires
great
virtue
and
resolution
to
withstand
their
temptations
and
they
have
perhaps
done
a
thousand
times
as
much
mischief
in
the
world
as
all
the
infidels
and
atheists
put
together
these
men
ought
to
be
held
in
universal
abhorrence
and
never
spoken
of
but
with
but
the
shunning
of
bad
books
is
only
one
of
the
problems
presented
to
us
in
the
choice
of
our
reading
in
the
great
multitude
of
really
good
and
valuable
books
how
shall
we
choose
those
which
are
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
us
to
know
the
universal
habit
of
desultory
simply
to
be
a
habit
not
to
be
indulged
in
nor
encouraged
by
scholars
or
by
those
who
aspire
to
the
station
of
teachers
there
are
perhaps
a
score
of
books
which
should
be
read
and
studied
by
every
one
who
claims
the
title
of
reader
but
aside
from
these
each
person
should
determine
through
a
process
of
rigid
what
course
of
reading
and
what
books
are
likely
to
produce
the
most
profitable
results
to
him
find
out
if
possible
what
is
your
special
bent
of
mind
what
line
of
inquiry
or
investigation
is
the
most
congenial
to
your
taste
or
mental
capacity
having
determined
this
question
let
your
reading
all
centre
upon
that
topic
of
study
which
you
have
made
your
own
it
be
literature
science
history
art
or
any
of
the
innumerable
subdivisions
of
these
subjects
in
other
words
choose
a
specialty
and
follow
it
with
an
eye
single
to
it
alone
says
frederic
harrison
every
book
that
we
take
up
without
a
purpose
is
an
opportunity
lost
of
taking
up
a
book
with
a
purpose
every
bit
of
stray
information
which
we
cram
into
our
heads
without
any
sense
of
its
importance
is
for
the
most
part
a
bit
of
the
most
useful
information
driven
out
of
our
heads
and
choked
off
from
our
minds
we
know
that
books
differ
in
value
as
much
as
diamonds
differ
from
the
sand
on
the
as
much
as
our
living
friend
differs
from
a
dead
rat
we
know
that
much
in
the
world
of
much
in
all
trivial
enervating
inane
even
noxious
and
thus
where
we
have
infinite
opportunities
of
wasting
our
effort
to
no
end
of
fatiguing
our
minds
without
enriching
them
of
clogging
the
spirit
without
satisfying
it
there
i
can
not
but
think
the
very
infinity
of
opportunities
is
robbing
us
of
the
actual
power
of
using
them
to
know
anything
that
turns
up
is
in
the
infinity
of
knowledge
to
know
nothing
to
read
the
first
book
we
come
across
in
the
wilderness
of
books
is
to
learn
nothing
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
ten
thousand
volumes
is
to
be
practically
indifferent
to
all
that
is
it
is
of
paramount
importance
says
schopenhauer
to
acquire
the
art
to
read
in
other
words
of
not
reading
such
books
as
occupy
the
public
mind
or
even
those
which
make
a
noise
in
the
world
and
reach
several
editions
in
their
first
and
last
year
of
existence
we
should
recollect
that
he
who
writes
for
fools
finds
an
enormous
audience
and
we
should
devote
the
ever
scant
leisure
of
our
circumscribed
existence
to
the
of
all
ages
and
nations
those
who
tower
over
humanity
and
whom
the
voice
of
fame
proclaims
only
such
writers
cultivate
and
instruct
and
john
ruskin
offers
the
following
pertinent
advice
to
beginners
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
you
not
only
for
art
s
sake
but
for
all
kinds
of
sake
in
these
days
of
book
deluge
to
keep
out
of
the
salt
swamps
of
literature
and
live
on
a
little
rocky
island
of
your
own
with
a
spring
and
a
lake
in
it
pure
and
good
i
can
not
of
course
suggest
the
choice
of
your
library
to
you
for
every
several
mind
needs
different
books
but
there
are
some
books
which
we
all
need
and
assuredly
if
you
read
homer
plato
æschylus
herodotus
dante
shakspeare
and
spenser
as
much
as
you
ought
you
will
not
require
wide
enlargement
of
your
shelves
to
right
and
left
of
them
for
purposes
of
perpetual
study
among
modern
books
avoid
generally
magazine
and
review
literature
sometimes
it
may
contain
a
useful
abridgment
or
a
wholesome
piece
of
criticism
but
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
it
will
either
waste
your
time
or
mislead
you
if
you
want
to
understand
any
subject
whatever
read
the
best
book
upon
it
you
can
hear
of
not
a
review
of
the
book
a
common
book
will
often
give
you
much
amusement
but
it
is
only
a
noble
book
which
will
give
you
dear
if
any
of
us
could
recall
the
time
which
we
have
spent
in
desultory
and
profitless
reading
and
devote
it
now
faithfully
to
the
prosecution
of
that
special
line
of
study
which
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
chosen
how
largely
we
might
add
to
our
fund
of
useful
knowledge
and
how
grandly
we
might
increase
our
intellectual
stature
and
again
remarks
james
herbert
morse
if
i
could
recover
the
hours
idly
given
to
the
newspaper
not
for
my
own
gratification
but
solely
for
my
neighbor
at
the
i
could
compass
a
solid
course
of
english
and
american
history
get
at
the
antecedents
of
political
parties
in
the
two
countries
and
give
the
reasons
for
the
existence
of
gladstone
and
parnell
of
blaine
and
edmunds
in
modern
there
is
undoubtedly
a
reason
for
them
all
two
columns
a
day
in
the
i
could
easily
have
spared
for
they
were
given
mainly
to
and
the
search
for
corpses
or
to
the
romance
of
the
reporter
concerning
the
during
the
last
ten
years
absorbed
just
about
the
time
i
might
have
spent
in
reading
a
very
respectable
course
in
history
embracing
say
curtius
and
grote
for
greece
mommsen
merivale
and
gibbon
for
rome
macaulay
and
green
for
my
roots
in
saxondom
bancroft
hildreth
and
palfrey
for
the
ancestral
tree
in
america
together
with
a
very
notable
excursion
into
spain
and
holland
with
motley
and
prescott
course
which
i
consider
very
desirable
and
one
which
should
set
up
a
man
of
middle
age
very
fairly
in
historical
knowledge
i
am
sure
i
could
have
saved
this
amount
out
of
any
ten
years
of
my
newspaper
reading
alone
without
cutting
off
any
portion
of
that
really
valuable
contribution
for
which
the
daily
paper
is
to
be
honored
and
which
would
be
needed
to
make
me
an
intelligent
man
in
the
history
of
my
own
it
is
not
necessary
that
in
selecting
a
library
or
in
choosing
what
you
will
read
you
should
have
many
books
at
your
disposal
a
few
books
well
chosen
and
carefully
read
will
be
of
infinitely
more
value
to
you
than
any
miscellaneous
collection
however
large
it
is
possible
for
the
man
of
one
book
to
be
better
equipped
in
knowledge
and
literary
attainments
than
he
whose
shelves
are
loaded
with
all
the
fashionable
literature
of
the
day
if
your
means
will
not
permit
you
the
luxury
of
a
library
buy
one
book
or
a
few
books
chosen
with
special
reference
to
the
line
of
reading
which
you
have
determined
upon
let
no
persuade
you
to
buy
of
his
wares
unless
they
bear
exactly
upon
your
specialty
you
can
not
afford
to
waste
money
on
mere
catchpenny
or
machine
publications
whose
only
recommendation
is
that
they
are
harmless
and
that
they
sell
well
that
man
is
to
be
envied
who
can
say
i
have
a
library
of
fifty
or
of
a
hundred
volumes
all
relating
to
my
chosen
line
of
thought
and
not
a
single
inferior
or
worthless
volume
among
i
have
before
me
a
list
of
books
books
fashioned
by
the
intellect
of
godlike
men
which
every
person
who
aspires
to
the
rank
of
teacher
or
scholar
should
regard
as
his
inheritance
from
the
of
the
ages
if
you
know
these

is

geoffrey

having
chosen
the
books
which
are
to
be
our
friends
and
counsellors
the
next
question
to
be
considered
is
how
shall
we
use
them
shall
we
read
them
through
as
hastily
as
possible
believing
that
the
more
we
read
the
more
learned
we
are
or
shall
we
not
derive
more
profit
by
reading
slowly
and
by
making
the
of
each
book
our
i
do
not
believe
that
any
general
rule
can
be
given
with
reference
to
this
matter
some
readers
will
take
in
a
page
at
a
glance
and
will
more
thoroughly
master
a
book
in
a
week
than
others
could
possibly
master
it
in
six
months
it
required
frederick
robertson
half
a
year
to
read
a
small
manual
of
chemistry
and
thoroughly
to
digest
its
contents
miss
martineau
and
auguste
comte
were
remarkably
slow
readers
but
then
that
which
they
read
lay
fructifying
and
came
out
a
living
tree
with
leaves
and
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
readers
of
every
grade
of
genius
it
is
generally
better
to
read
by
subjects
to
learn
what
different
writers
have
thought
and
said
concerning
that
matter
of
which
you
are
making
a
special
study
not
many
books
are
to
be
read
hastily
through
a
person
who
was
a
very
great
reader
and
hard
thinker
says
bishop
thirlwall
once
told
me
that
he
never
took
up
a
book
except
with
the
view
of
making
himself
master
of
some
subject
which
he
was
studying
and
that
while
he
was
so
engaged
he
made
all
his
reading
converge
to
that
point
in
this
way
he
might
read
parts
of
many
books
but
not
a
single
one
from
end
to
this
i
take
to
be
an
excellent
method
of
study
but
one
which
implies
the
command
of
many
books
as
well
as
of
much
seneca
the
old
roman
teacher
says
definite
reading
is
profitable
miscellaneous
reading
is
pleasant
the
reading
of
many
authors
and
of
all
kinds
of
works
has
in
it
something
vague
and
says
quintilian
every
good
writer
is
to
be
read
and
diligently
and
when
the
volume
is
finished
it
is
to
be
gone
through
again
from
the
martin
luther
in
his
table
talk
says
all
who
would
study
with
advantage
in
any
art
whatsoever
ought
to
betake
themselves
to
the
reading
of
some
sure
and
certain
books
oftentimes
over
for
to
read
many
books
produceth
confusion
rather
than
learning
like
as
those
who
dwell
everywhere
are
not
anywhere
at
reading
says
locke
the
philosopher
furnishes
the
mind
only
with
materials
of
knowledge
it
is
thinking
that
makes
what
are
read
over
we
are
of
the
ruminating
kind
and
it
is
not
enough
to
cram
ourselves
with
a
great
load
of
collections
unless
we
chew
them
over
again
they
will
not
give
us
strength
and
much
reading
says
robert
south
is
like
much
eating
useless
without
desultory
reading
writes
julius
hare
is
indeed
very
mischievous
by
fostering
habits
of
loose
discontinuous
thought
by
turning
the
memory
into
a
common
sewer
for
rubbish
of
all
thoughts
to
flow
through
and
by
relaxing
the
power
of
attention
which
of
all
our
faculties
most
needs
care
and
is
most
improved
by
it
but
a
course
of
study
will
no
more
weaken
the
mind
than
hard
exercise
will
weaken
the
body
nor
will
a
strong
understanding
be
weighed
down
by
its
knowledge
any
more
than
oak
is
by
its
leaves
or
than
samson
was
by
his
locks
he
whose
sinews
are
drained
by
his
hair

already
be

says
thomas
carlyle
learn
to
be
good
readers
is
perhaps
a
more
difficult
thing
than
you
imagine
learn
to
be
discriminative
in
your
reading
to
read
faithfully
and
with
your
best
attention
all
kinds
of
things
which
you
have
a
real
interest
in
real
not
an
imaginary
which
you
find
to
be
really
fit
for
what
you
are
engaged
in
the
most
unhappy
of
all
men
is
the
man
who
can
not
tell
what
he
is
going
to
do
who
has
got
no
work
cut
out
for
him
in
the
world
and
does
not
go
into
it
for
work
is
the
grand
cure
of
all
the
maladies
and
miseries
that
ever
beset
mankind
work
which
you
intend
getting
says
ralph
waldo
emerson
the
best
rule
of
reading
will
be
a
method
from
nature
and
not
a
mechanical
one
of
hours
and
pages
it
holds
each
student
to
a
pursuit
of
his
native
aim
instead
of
a
desultory
miscellany
let
him
read
what
is
proper
to
him
and
not
waste
his
memory
on
a
crowd
of
mediocrities
the
three
practical
rules
which
i
have
to
offer
are
never
read
any
book
that
is
not
a
year
old
never
read
any
but
famed
books
never
read
any
but
what
you
like
or
in
shakspeare
s
phrase
no
profit
goes
where
is
no
pleasure
ta
en
in
brief
sir
study
what
you
most
let
us
read
good
works
often
over
says
another
writer
some
skip
from
volume
to
volume
touching
on
all
points
resting
on
none
we
hold
on
the
contrary
that
if
a
book
be
worth
reading
once
it
is
worth
reading
twice
and
that
if
it
stands
a
second
reading
it
may
stand
a
third
this
indeed
is
one
great
test
of
the
excellence
of
books
many
books
require
to
be
read
more
than
once
in
order
to
be
seen
in
their
proper
colors
and
latent
glories
and
truths
will
disclose
themselves
again
let
us
read
thoughtfully
this
is
a
great
secret
in
the
right
use
of
books
not
lazily
to
mumble
like
the
dogs
in
the
siege
of
corinth
as
dead
bones
the
words
of
the
author
slavishly
to
assent
to
his
every
word
and
cry
amen
to
his
every
conclusion
to
read
him
as
an
officer
his
general
s
orders
but
to
read
him
with
suspicion
with
inquiry
with
a
free
exercise
of
your
own
faculties
with
the
admiration
of
intelligence
and
not
with
the
wonder
of
ignorance
is
the
proper
and
profitable
way
of
reading
the
great
authors
of
your
native
says
sir
arthur
helps
there
is
another
view
of
reading
which
though
it
is
obvious
enough
is
seldom
taken
i
imagine
or
at
least
acted
upon
and
that
is
that
in
the
course
of
our
reading
we
should
lay
up
in
our
minds
a
store
of
goodly
thoughts
in
words
which
should
be
a
living
treasure
of
knowledge
always
with
us
and
from
which
at
various
times
and
amidst
all
the
shifting
of
circumstances
we
might
be
sure
of
drawing
some
comfort
guidance
and
sympathy
in
any
work
that
is
worth
carefully
reading
there
is
generally
something
that
is
worth
remembering
accurately
a
man
whose
mind
is
enriched
with
the
best
sayings
of
his
own
country
is
a
more
independent
man
walks
the
streets
in
a
town
or
the
lanes
in
the
country
with
far
more
delight
than
he
otherwise
would
have
and
is
taught
by
wise
observers
of
man
and
nature
to
examine
for
himself
sancho
panza
with
his
proverbs
is
a
great
deal
better
than
he
would
have
been
without
them
and
i
contend
that
a
man
has
something
in
himself
to
meet
troubles
and
difficulties
small
or
great
who
has
stored
in
his
mind
some
of
the
best
things
which
have
been
said
about
troubles
and
and
john
ruskin
no
book
is
worth
anything
which
is
not
worth
nor
is
it
serviceable
until
it
has
been
read
and
reread
and
loved
and
loved
again
and
marked
so
that
you
can
refer
to
the
passages
you
want
in
it
as
a
soldier
can
seize
the
weapons
he
needs
in
an
armory
or
a
housewife
bring
the
spice
she
needs
from
her
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
says
matthew
browne
of
urging
overmuch
the
propriety
of
frequent
very
frequent
reading
of
the
same
book
the
book
remains
the
same
but
the
reader
changes
and
the
value
of
reading
lies
in
the
collision
of
minds
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
conceivable
amount
of
reading
could
ever
put
me
into
the
position
with
respect
to
his
mean
as
to
intelligence
which
the
author
strove
to
place
me
i
may
read
him
a
hundred
times
and
not
catch
the
precise
right
point
of
view
and
may
read
him
a
hundred
and
one
times
and
approach
it
the
hundred
and
first
the
driest
and
hardest
book
that
ever
was
contains
an
interest
over
and
above
what
can
be
picked
out
of
it
and
laid
so
to
speak
on
the
table
it
is
interesting
as
my
friend
is
interesting
it
is
a
problem
which
invites
me
to
closer
knowledge
and
usually
means
better
liking
he
must
be
a
poor
friend
that
we
only
care
to
see
once
or
twice
and
then
the
great
secret
of
reading
consists
in
this
says
charles
richardson
that
it
does
not
matter
so
much
what
we
read
or
how
we
read
it
as
what
we
think
and
how
we
think
it
reading
is
only
the
fuel
and
the
mind
once
on
fire
any
and
all
material
will
feed
the
flame
provided
only
it
have
any
combustible
matter
in
it
and
we
can
not
tell
from
what
quarter
the
next
material
will
come
the
thought
we
need
the
facts
we
are
in
search
of
may
make
their
appearance
in
the
corner
of
the
newspaper
or
in
some
forgotten
volume
long
ago
consigned
to
dust
and
oblivion
the
mind
that
is
not
awake
and
alive
will
find
a
library
a
barren
wilderness
now
gather
up
the
scraps
and
fragments
of
thought
on
whatever
subject
you
may
be
studying
of
course
by
a
i
do
not
mean
a
mere
receptacle
for
odds
and
ends
a

acquire
the
habit
of
gathering
everything
whenever
and
wherever
you
find
it
that
belongs
in
your
line
or
lines
of
study
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
such
fragments
will
arrange
themselves
into
an
orderly
whole
by
the
very
organizing
power
of
your
own
thinking
acting
in
a
definite
direction
this
is
a
true
process
of
but
you
see
it
is
no
mechanical
process
of
mere
aggregation
it
requires
activity
of
thought
but
without
that
what
is
any
reading
but
mere
passive
amusement
and
it
requires
method
i

in

edward
gibbon
the
historian
tells
us
that
a
taste
for
books
was
the
pleasure
and
glory
of
his
life
let
us
read
with
method
he
says
and
propose
to
ourselves
an
end
to
what
our
studies
may
point
the
use
of
reading
is
to
aid
us
in
among
practical
suggestions
to
those
who
would
read
for
profit
i
have
found
nothing
more
pertinent
than
the
following
from
the
posthumous
papers
of
bryan
waller
procter
always
read
the
preface
to
a
book
it
places
you
on
vantage
ground
and
enables
you
to
survey
more
completely
the
book
itself
you
frequently
also
discover
the
character
of
the
author
from
the
preface
you
see
his
aims
perhaps
his
prejudices
you
see
the
point
of
view
from
which
he
takes
his
pictures
the
rocks
and
impediments
which
he
himself
beholds
and
you
steer
accordingly
understand
every
word
you
read
if
possible
every
allusion
of
the
author
practicable
while
you
are
reading
if
not
make
search
and
inquiry
as
soon
as
may
be
afterward
have
a
dictionary
near
you
when
you
read
and
when
you
read
a
book
of
travels
always
read
with
a
map
of
the
country
at
hand
without
a
map
the
information
is
vague
and
transitory
after
having
read
as
much
as
your
mind
will
easily
retain
sum
up
what
you
have
read
to
place
in
view
the
portion
or
subject
that
has
formed
your
morning
s
study
and
then
reckon
up
as
you
would
reckon
up
a
sum
the
facts
or
items
of
knowledge
that
you
have
gained
it
generally
happens
that
the
amount
of
three
or
four
hours
reading
may
be
reduced
to
and
concentrated
in
half
a
dozen
propositions
these
are
your
gains
are
the
facts
or
opinions
that
you
have
acquired
you
may
investigate
the
truth
of
them
hereafter
although
i
think
that
one
s
general
reading
should
extend
over
many
subjects
yet
for
serious
we
should
confine
ourselves
to
some
branch
of
literature
or
science
otherwise
the
mind
becomes
confused
and
enfeebled
and
the
thoughts
dissipated
on
many
things
will
settle
profitably
on
none
a
man
whose
duration
of
life
is
limited
and
whose
powers
are
limited
also
should
not
aim
at
all
things
but
should
content
himself
with
a
few
by
such
means
he
may
master
one
and
become
tolerably
familiar
perhaps
with
two
or
three
arts
or
sciences
he
may
indeed
even
make
valuable
contributions
to
them
without
this
economy
of
labor
he
can
not
produce
any
complete
work
nor
can
he
exhaust
any
every
scholar
is
familiar
with
lord
bacon
s
classification
of
books
to
be
tasted
others
to
be
swallowed
and
some
few
to
be
chewed
and
digested
that
is
some
books
are
to
be
read
only
in
parts
others
to
be
read
but
not
curiously
and
some
few
to
be
read
wholly
and
with
diligence
and
coleridge
s
classification
of
the
various
kinds
of
readers
is
perhaps
not
quite
so
well
known
he
said
that
some
readers
are
like
let
pass
away
all
that
is
pure
and
good
and
retain
only
what
is
impure
and
refuse
another
class
he
typified
by
a
sponge
these
are
they
whose
minds
suck
all
up
and
give
it
back
again
only
a
little
dirtier
others
again
he
likened
to
an
and
their
reading
to
the
sand
which
runs
in
and
out
and
leaves
no
trace
behind
and
still
others
he
compared
to
the
slave
in
the
golconda
mines
who
retains
the
gold
and
the
gem
and
casts
aside
the
dust
and
the
dross
charles
colton
the
author
of
lacon
says
there
are
three
kinds
of
readers
first
those
who
read
to
think
they
are
rare
second
those
who
read
to
write
they
are
common
third
those
who
read
to
talk
they
form
the
great
majority
and
goethe
the
greatest
name
in
german
literature
makes
still
a
different
classification
some
readers
he
tells
us
enjoy
without
judgment
others
judge
without
enjoyment
and
some
there
are
who
judge
while
they
enjoy
and
enjoy
while
they
judge
in
these
days
when
so
far
as
is
concerned
we
are
overburdened
with
an
embarrassment
of
riches
we
can
not
afford
to
read
even
in
the
books
which
we
have
chosen
as
ours
those
things
which
have
no
relationship
to
our
studies
which
do
not
concern
us
and
which
are
sure
to
be
forgotten
as
soon
as
read
the
art
of
reading
says
philip
gilbert
hamerton
in
his
admirable
essay
on
the
intellectual
life
is
to
skip
judiciously
the
art
is
to
skip
all
that
does
not
concern
us
whilst
missing
nothing
that
we
really
need
no
external
guidance
can
teach
this
for
nobody
but
ourselves
can
guess
what
the
needs
of
our
intellect
may
be
but
let
us
select
with
decisive
firmness
independently
of
other
people
s
advice
independently
of
the
authority
of
and
charles
richardson
referring
to
the
same
subject
remarks
the
art
of
skipping
is
in
a
word
the
art
of
noting
and
shunning
that
which
is
bad
or
frivolous
or
misleading
or
unsuitable
for
one
s
individual
needs
if
you
are
convinced
that
the
book
or
the
chapter
is
bad
you
can
not
drop
it
too
quickly
if
it
is
simply
idle
and
foolish
put
it
away
on
that
account
you
are
properly
seeking
amusement
from
idleness
and
frivolity
if
it
is
something
deceitful
and
disingenuous
your
task
is
not
so
easy
but
your
conscience
will
give
you
warning
and
the
sharp
examination
which
should
follow
will
tell
you
that

a
library
is
the
scholar
s
workshop
to
the
teacher
or
professional
man
a
collection
of
good
books
is
as
necessary
as
a
kit
of
tools
to
a
carpenter
and
yet
i
am
aware
that
many
persons
are
engaged
in
teaching
who
have
neither
a
library
of
their
own
nor
access
to
any
other
collection
of
books
suitable
to
their
use
there
are
others
who
having
every
opportunity
to
secure
the
best
of
books
a
public
library
near
at
hand
offering
them
the
free
use
of
works
most
valuable
to
them
make
no
effort
to
profit
by
these
advantages
they
care
nothing
for
any
books
save
the
indispensable
to
their
profession
and
for
these
only
so
far
as
necessity
obliges
them
to
do
so
the
libraries
of
many
persons
calling
themselves
teachers
consist
solely
of
many
of
which
have
been
presented
them
by
accommodating
for
examination
with
a
view
to
and
yet
we
hear
such
teachers
talk
learnedly
about
the
introduction
of
english
literature
into
the
common
schools
of
the
country
and
the
necessity
of
cultivating
among
the
children
a
wholesome
love
and
taste
for
reading
if
inquiry
were
made
we
might
discover
that
by
a
study
of
english
literature
these
teachers
understand
some
memoriter
exercises
in
shaw
s
manual
or
brooke
s
primer
and
that
as
to
good
reading
some
there
are
who
are
entertained
more
deeply
by
peck
s
bad
boy
than
by
shakspeare
s
merchant
of
talk
not
about
directing
and
cultivating
the
of
your
pupils
until
you
have
successfully
directed
and
cultivated
your
own
and
the
first
step
towards
doing
this
is
the
selection
and
purchase
of
a
library
for
yourself
which
shall
be
all
your
own
a
very
few
books
will
do
if
they
are
of
the
right
kind
and
they
must
be
a
borrowed
book
is
but
a
cheap
pleasure
an
unappreciated
and
unsatisfactory
tool
to
know
the
true
value
of
books
and
to
derive
any
satisfactory
benefit
from
them
you
must
first
feel
the
sweet
delight
of
buying
them
must
know
the
preciousness
of
possession
you
plead
poverty
insufficiency
of
your
salary
but
do
you
not
spend
for
other
things
entirely
unnecessary
much
more
every
year
than
the
cost
of
a
few
books
the
immediate
outlay
need
not
be
large
the
returns
which
you
will
realize
will
be
great
in
proportion
to
your
good
judgment
and
earnestness
not
only
will
the
possession
of
a
good
library
add
to
your
means
of
enjoyment
and
increase
your
capacity
for
doing
good
it
may
if
you
are
we
all
are
you
in
the
way
of
occupying
a
more
desirable
position
and
earning
a
more
satisfactory
reward
for
your
labors
there
are
two
kinds
of
books
that
you
will
need
in
your
library
first
those
which
are
purely
professional
and
are
in
the
strictest
sense
the
tools
of
your
craft
second
those
which
belong
to
your
chosen
department
of
literature
and
are
to
be
regarded
as
your
friends
companions
and
counsellors
i
can
not
of
course
dictate
to
you
what
these
books
shall
be
the
lists
given
in
the
chapters
which
follow
this
are
designed
simply
as
suggestive
aids
but
in
a
library
of
fifty
or
even
thirty
volumes
you
may
possess
infinite
riches
and
means
for
a
lifetime
of
enjoyment
while
on
the
other
hand
if
your
selection
is
injudicious
you
may
expend
thousands
of
dollars
for
a
collection
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
literature
which
will
be
only
an
incumbrance
and
a
hindrance
to
you
i
would
urge
upon
every
young
man
as
the
beginning
of
his
due
and
wise
provision
for
his
household
says
john
ruskin
to
obtain
as
soon
as
he
can
by
the
severest
economy
a
restricted
serviceable
and
series
of
books
for
use
through
life
making
his
little
library
of
all
the
furniture
in
his
room
the
most
studied
and
decorative
piece
every
volume
having
its
assigned
place
like
a
little
statue
in
its
niche
and
one
of
the
earliest
and
strictest
lessons
to
the
children
of
the
house
being
how
to
turn
the
pages
of
their
own
literary
possessions
lightly
and
deliberately
with
no
chance
of
tearing
or
dog
and
henry
ward
beecher
emphasizes
the
same
thing
remarking
that
among
the
early
ambitions
to
be
excited
in
clerks
workmen
journeymen
and
indeed
among
all
that
are
struggling
up
in
life
from
nothing
to
something
the
most
important
is
that
of
forming
and
continually
adding
to
a
library
of
good
books
a
little
library
growing
larger
every
year
is
an
honorable
part
of
a
man
s
history
it
is
a
man
s
duty
to
have
books
a
library
is
not
a
luxury
but
one
of
the
necessaries
of
how
much
do
you
think
we
spend
altogether
on
our
libraries
public
or
private
as
compared
with
what
we
spend
on
our
horses
asks
another
enthusiastic
lover
of
books
already
quoted
if
a
man
spends
lavishly
on
his
library
you
call
him
mad
bibliomaniac
but
you
never
call
any
one
a
though
men
ruin
themselves
every
day
by
their
horses
and
you
do
not
hear
of
people
ruining
themselves
by
their
books
we
talk
of
food
for
the
mind
as
of
food
for
the
body
now
a
good
book
contains
such
food
inexhaustibly
it
is
a
provision
for
life
and
for
the
best
of
us
yet
how
long
most
people
would
look
at
the
best
book
before
they
would
give
the
price
of
a
large
turbot
for
it
though
there
have
been
men
who
have
pinched
their
stomachs
and
bared
their
backs
to
buy
a
book
whose
libraries
were
cheaper
to
them
i
think
in
the
end
than
most
men
s
dinners
are
we
are
few
of
us
put
to
such
trial
and
more
the
pity
for
indeed
a
precious
thing
is
all
the
more
precious
to
us
if
it
has
been
won
by
work
or
economy
and
if
public
libraries
were
half
as
costly
as
public
dinners
or
books
cost
the
tenth
part
of
what
bracelets
do
even
foolish
men
and
women
might
sometimes
suspect
there
was
good
in
reading
as
well
as
in
munching
and
sparkling
whereas
the
very
cheapness
of
literature
is
making
even
wise
people
forget
that
if
a
book
is
worth
reading
it
is
worth
the
truest
owner
of
a
library
says
the
author
of
hesperides
is
he
who
has
bought
each
book
for
the
love
he
bears
to
it
is
happy
and
content
to
say
here
are
my
jewels
my
choicest
material
possessions
is
proud
to
crown
such
assertion
thus
i
am
content
that
this
library
shall
represent
the
use
of
the
talents
given
me
by
heaven
that
man
s
library
though
not
commensurate
with
his
love
for
books
will
demonstrate
what
he
has
been
able
to
accomplish
with
his
resources
it
will
denote
economy
of
living
eagerness
to
possess
the
particles
that
compose
his
library
and
quick
watchfulness
to
seize
them
when
means
and
opportunities
serve
such
a
man
has
built
a
temple
of
which
each
brick
has
been
the
subject
of
curious
and
acute
intelligent
examination
and
appreciation
before
it
has
been
placed
in
the
sacred
every
man
should
have
a
library
exclaims
william
axon
the
works
of
the
grandest
masters
of
literature
may
now
be
procured
at
prices
that
place
them
within
the
reach
almost
of
the
very
poorest
and
we
may
all
put
parnassian
into
our
chambers
to
cheer
us
with
the
sweetness
of
their
songs
and
when
we
have
got
our
little
library
we
may
look
proudly
at
shakspeare
and
bacon
and
bunyan
as
they
stand
in
our
bookcase
with
other
noble
spirits
and
one
or
two
of
whom
the
world
knows
nothing
but
whose
worth
we
have
often
tested
these
may
cheer
and
enlighten
us
may
inspire
us
with
higher
aims
and
aspirations
may
make
us
if
we
use
them
rightly
wiser
and
better
good
old
george
dyer
the
friend
of
the
poet
southey
as
learned
as
he
was
benevolent
was
wont
to
say
libraries
are
the
wardrobes
of
literature
whence
men
properly
informed
may
bring
forth
something
for
ornament
much
for
curiosity
and
more
for
any
library
is
an
attraction
says
the
venerable
bronson
alcott
and
victor
hugo
a
library
implies
an
act
of
faith
which
generations
still
in
darkness
hid
sign
in
their
night
in
witness
of
the
john
bright
the
great
english
statesman
and
reformer
in
a
speech
at
the
opening
of
the
birmingham
free
library
a
short
time
ago
remarked
you
may
have
in
a
house
costly
pictures
and
costly
ornaments
and
a
great
variety
of
decoration
yet
so
far
as
my
judgment
goes
i
would
prefer
to
have
one
comfortable
room
well
stocked
with
books
to
all
you
can
give
me
in
the
way
of
decoration
which
the
highest
art
can
supply
the
only
subject
of
lamentation
feels
that
always
i
think
in
the
presence
of
a
life
is
too
short
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
say
also
that
our
industry
is
so
far
deficient
that
we
seem
to
have
no
hope
of
a
full
enjoyment
of
the
ample
repast
that
is
spread
before
us
in
the
houses
of
the
humble
a
little
library
in
my
opinion
is
a
most
precious
jean
paul
richter
it
is
said
was
always
melancholy
in
a
large
library
because
it
reminded
him
of
his
ignorance
a
library
may
be
regarded
as
the
solemn
chamber
in
which
a
man
can
take
counsel
of
all
that
have
been
wise
and
great
and
good
and
glorious
amongst
the
men
that
have
gone
before
him
said
george
dawson
also
at
birmingham
if
we
come
down
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
bare
and
immediate
utilities
of
a
library
we
find
that
here
a
man
gets
himself
ready
for
his
calling
arms
himself
for
his
profession
finds
out
the
facts
that
are
to
determine
his
trade
prepares
himself
for
his
examination
the
utilities
of
it
are
endless
and
priceless
it
is
too
a
place
of
pastime
for
man
has
no
amusement
more
innocent
more
sweet
more
gracious
more
elevating
and
more
fortifying
than
he
can
find
in
a
library
if
he
be
fond
of
books
his
fondness
will
discipline
him
as
well
as
amuse
him
a
library
is
the
strengthener
of
all
that
is
great
in
life
and
the
repeller
of
what
is
petty
and
mean
and
half
the
gossip
of
society
would
perish
if
the
books
that
are
truly
worth
reading
were
read
when
we
look
through
the
houses
of
a
large
part
of
the
middle
classes
of
this
country
we
find
there
everything
but
what
there
ought
most
to
be
there
are
no
books
in
them
worth
talking
of
if
a
question
arises
of
geography
they
have
no
atlases
if
the
question
be
when
a
great
man
was
born
they
can
not
help
you
they
can
give
you
a
gorgeous
bed
with
four
posts
marvellous
adornments
luxurious
hangings
and
lacquered
shams
all
round
they
can
give
you
dinners
and
wine
that
one
can
or
can
not
honestly
praise
but
useful
books
are
almost
the
last
things
that
are
to
be
found
there
and
when
the
mind
is
empty
of
those
things
that
books
can
alone
fill
it
with
then
the
seven
devils
of
pettiness
frivolity
fashionableness
gentility
scandal
small
slander
and
the
chronicling
of
small
beer
come
in
and
take
possession
half
this
nonsense
would
be
dropped
if
men
would
only
understand
the
elevating
influences
of
their
communing
constantly
with
the
lofty
thoughts
and
high
resolves
of
men

bleating

a
strange
sense
of

of

they
are

down

chapter
iv
books
for
every
scholar
these
books
of
mine
as
you
well
know
are
not
drawn
up
here
for
display
however
much
the
pride
of
the
eye
may
be
gratified
in
beholding
them
they
are
on
actual
to
assist
teachers
and
scholars
and
those
who
aspire
to
become
such
in
making
judicious
selection
of
books
for
their
libraries
i
submit
the
following
list
which
includes
the
greater
part
of
all
that
is
the
very
best
and
the
most
enduring
in
our
language
it
is
not
intended
to
embrace
professional
works
nor
works
suited
merely
for
students
of
specialties
the
books
named
are
such
as
will
grace
the
library
of
any
scholar
no
matter
what
his
profession
or
his
preferences
they
are
books
which
every
teacher
ought
to
know
they
are
books
of
which
no
one
can
ever
feel
ashamed
the
first
thing
naturally
when
one
enters
a
scholar
s
study
or
library
says
holmes
is
to
look
at
his
books
one
gets
a
notion
very
speedily
of
his
tastes
and
the
range
of
his
pursuits
by
a
glance
round
his
and
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
want
a
library
of
which
you
will
be
proud
you
can
not
be
too
careful
as
to
the
character
of
the
books
you
put

i
close
this

with
leigh
hunt
s
pleasant
descriptive
of
his
own
library
sitting
last
winter
among
my
books
and
walled
round
with
all
the
comfort
and
protection
which
they
and
my
fireside
could
afford
me
wit
a
table
of
books
at
my
back
my
on
one
side
of
me
some
shelves
on
the
other
and
the
feeling
of
the
warm
fire
at
my
feet
began
to
consider
how
i
loved
the
authors
of
those
books
how
i
loved
them
too
not
only
for
the
imaginative
pleasures
they
afforded
me
but
for
their
making
me
love
the
very
books
themselves
and
delight
to
be
in
contact
with
them
i
looked
sideways
at
my
spenser
my
theocritus
and
my
arabian
nights
then
above
them
at
my
italian
poets
then
behind
me
at
my
dryden
and
pope
my
romances
and
my
boccaccio
then
on
my
left
side
at
my
chaucer
who
lay
on
my
and
thought
how
natural
it
was
in
charles
lamb
to
give
a
kiss
to
an
old
folio
as
i
once
saw
him
do
to
chapman
s
homer
i
entrench
myself
in
my
books
equally
against
sorrow
and
the
weather
if
the
wind
comes
through
a
passage
i
look
about
to
see
how
i
can
fence
it
off
by
a
better
disposition
of
my
movables
if
a
melancholy
thought
is
importunate
i
give
another
glance
at
my
spenser
when
i
speak
of
being
in
contact
with
my
books
i
mean
it
literally
i
like
to
be
able
to
lean
my
head
against
them
the
very
perusal
of
the
backs
is
a
discipline

there

guzman

for

charles
grandison
and
has
his
claims
admitted
nothing
while
i
live
and
think
can
deprive
me
of
my
value
for
such
treasures
i
can
help
the
appreciation
of
them
while
i
last
and
love
them
till
i
die
and
perhaps
i
may
chance
some
quiet
day
to
lay
my
temples
on
a
book
and
so
have
the
death
i
most
illustration
chapter
what
books
shall
young
folks
read
the
greatest
problem
presented
to
the
consideration
of
parents
and
teachers
is
how
properly
to
regulate
and
direct
the
reading
of
the
children
there
is
no
scarcity
of
the
poorest
child
may
have
free
access
to
books
and
papers
more
than
he
can
read
the
publication
of
periodicals
and
cheap
books
especially
designed
to
meet
the
tastes
of
young
people
has
developed
into
an
enterprise
of
vast
proportions
every
day
millions
of
pages
of
reading
matter
designed
for
children
are
printed
and
scattered
broadcast
over
the
land
but
unlimited
opportunities
often
prove
to
be
a
damage
and
a
detriment
and
rather
than
scarcity
is
to
be
deplored
as
a
general
rule
the
books
read
by
young
people
are
not
such
as
lead
to
studious
habits
or
induce
correct
ideas
of
right
living
they
are
intended
simply
to
amuse
there
are
no
elements
of
strength
in
them
leading
up
to
a
noble
manhood
i
doubt
if
in
the
future
it
can
be
said
of
any
great
statesman
or
scholar
that
his
tastes
had
been
formed
and
his
energies
directed
and
sustained
through
the
influence
of
his
early
reading
but
rather
that
he
had
attained
success
and
whatever
of
true
nobility
there
is
in
him
in
spite
of
such
influence
this
was
not
always
so
the
experience
of
a
few
scholars
will
illustrate
from
my
infancy
says
benjamin
franklin
i
was
passionately
fond
of
reading
and
all
the
money
that
came
into
my
hands
was
laid
out
in
the
purchasing
of
books
i
was
very
fond
of
voyages
my
first
acquisition
was
bunyan
s
works
in
separate
little
volumes
i
afterwards
sold
them
to
enable
me
to
buy
burton
s
historical
collections
they
were
small
chapmen
s
books
and
cheap
forty
volumes
in
all
my
father
s
little
library
consisted
chiefly
of
books
in
polemic
divinity
most
of
which
i
read
i
have
often
regretted
that
at
a
time
when
i
had
such
a
thirst
for
knowledge
more
proper
books
had
not
fallen
in
my
way
since
it
was
resolved
i
should
not
be
bred
to
divinity
there
was
among
them
plutarch
s
lives
which
i
read
abundantly
and
i
still
think
the
time
spent
to
great
advantage
there
was
also
a
book
of
defoe
s
called
an
essay
on
projects
and
another
of
mather
s
called
an
essay
to
do
good
which
perhaps
gave
me
a
turn
of
thinking
that
had
an
influence
on
some
of
the
principal
future
events
of
my
life
this
bookish
inclination
at
length
determined
my
father
to
make
me
a
printer
i
stood
out
some
time
but
at
last
was
persuaded
and
signed
the
indenture
when
i
was
yet
but
twelve
years
old
i
now
had
access
to
better
books
an
acquaintance
with
the
apprentices
of
booksellers
enabled
me
sometimes
to
borrow
a
small
one
which
i
was
careful
to
return
soon
and
clean
often
i
sat
up
in
my
chamber
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
when
the
book
was
borrowed
in
the
evening
and
to
be
returned
in
the
morning
lest
it
should
be
found
missing
about
this
time
i
met
with
an
odd
volume
of
the
i
had
never
before
seen
any
of
them
i
bought
it
read
it
over
and
over
and
was
much
delighted
with
it
i
thought
the
writing
excellent
and
wished
if
possible
to
imitate
it
with
that
view
i
took
some
of
the
papers
and
making
short
hints
of
the
sentiments
in
each
sentence
laid
them
by
a
few
days
and
then
without
looking
at
the
book
tried
to
complete
the
papers
again
by
expressing
each
hinted
sentiment
at
length
and
as
fully
as
it
had
been
expressed
before
in
any
suitable
words
that
should
occur
to
me
then
i
compared
my
spectator
with
the
original
discovered
some
of
my
faults
and
corrected
them
now
it
was
that
being
on
some
occasions
made
ashamed
of
my
ignorance
in
figures
which
i
had
twice
failed
learning
when
at
school
i
took
cocker
s
book
on
arithmetic
and
went
through
the
whole
by
myself
with
the
greatest
ease
i
also
read
seller
s
and
sturny
s
book
on
navigation
which
made
me
acquainted
with
the
little
geometry
it
contains
but
i
never
proceeded
far
in
that
science
i
read
about
this
time
locke
on
the
human
understanding
and
the
art
of
thinking
by
de
port
royal
while
i
was
intent
on
improving
my
language
i
met
with
an
english
grammar
i
think
it
was
greenwood
s
having
at
the
end
of
it
two
little
sketches
on
the
arts
of
rhetoric
and
logic
the
latter
finishing
with
a
dispute
in
the
socratic
method
and
soon
after
i
procured
xenophon
s
memorable
things
of
socrates
wherein
there
are
many
examples
of
the
same
method
i
was
charmed
with
it
adopted
it
dropped
my
abrupt
contradiction
and
positive
argumentation
and
put
on
the
humble
hugh
miller
that
most
admirable
scotchman
and
man
relates
a
similar
experience
during
my
sixth
year
i
spelled
my
way
through
the
shorter
catechism
the
proverbs
and
the
new
testament
and
then
entered
upon
the
highest
form
in
the
dame
s
school
as
a
member
of
the
bible
class
but
all
the
while
the
process
of
learning
had
been
a
dark
one
which
i
slowly
mastered
in
humble
confidence
in
the
awful
wisdom
of
the
schoolmistress
not
knowing
whither
it
tended
when
at
once
my
mind
awoke
to
the
meaning
of
the
most
delightful
of
all
narratives
story
of
joseph
was
there
ever
such
a
discovery
made
before
i
actually
found
out
for
myself
that
the
art
of
reading
is
the
art
of
finding
stories
in
books
and
from
that
moment
reading
became
one
of
the
most
delightful
of
my
amusements
i
began
by
getting
into
a
corner
on
the
dismissal
of
the
school
and
there
conning
over
to
myself
the
story
of
joseph
nor
did
one
perusal
serve
other
scripture
stories
followed
especial
the
story
of
samson
and
the
philistines
of
david
and
goliath
of
the
prophets
elijah
and
elisha
and
after
these
came
the
new
testament
stories
and
parables
assisted
by
my
uncles
too
i
began
to
collect
a
library
in
a
box
of
birch
bark
about
nine
inches
square
which
i
found
quite
large
enough
to
contain
a
great
many
immortal
works
jack
the
and
jack
and
the
and
the
yellow
dwarf
and
blue
beard
and
sinbad
the
sailor
and
beauty
and
the
beast
and
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
with
several
others
of
resembling
character
those
intolerable
nuisances
the
books
had
not
yet
arisen
like
tenebrious
stars
on
the
educational
horizon
to
darken
the
world
and
shed
their
blighting
influence
on
the
opening
intellect
of
the
youthhood
and
so
from
my
rudimental
that
made
themselves
truly
such
by
their
thorough
assimilation
with
the
rudimental
passed
on
without
being
conscious
of
break
or
line
of
division
to
books
on
which
the
learned
are
content
to
write
commentaries
and
dissertations
but
which
i
found
to
be
quite
as
nice
children
s
books
as
any
of
the
others
old
homer
wrote
admirably
for
little
folk
especially
in
the
odyssey
a
copy
of
which
in
the
only
true
translation
extant
judging
from
its
surpassing
interest
and
the
wrath
of
critics
such
i
hold
that
of
pope
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
a
neighbor
next
came
the
iliad
not
however
in
a
complete
copy
but
represented
by
four
of
the
six
volumes
of
bernard
lintot
with
what
power
and
at
how
early
an
age
true
genius
impresses
i
saw
even
at
this
immature
period
that
no
other
writer
could
cast
a
javelin
with
half
the
force
of
homer
the
missiles
went
whizzing
athwart
his
pages
and
i
could
see
the
momentary
gleam
of
the
steel
ere
it
buried
itself
deep
in
brass
and
i
next
succeeded
in
discovering
for
myself
a
child
s
book
of
not
less
interest
than
even
the
iliad
which
might
i
was
told
be
read
on
sabbaths
in
a
magnificent
old
edition
of
the
pilgrim
s
progress
printed
on
coarse
paper
and
charged
with
numerous
each
of
which
occupied
an
entire
page
which
on
principles
of
economy
bore
on
the
other
side
in
process
of
time
i
devoured
besides
these
genial
works
robinson
crusoe
gulliver
s
travels
ambrose
on
angels
the
judgment
chapter
in
howie
s
scotch
worthies
byron
s
narrative
and
the
adventures
of
philip
quarll
with
a
good
many
other
adventures
and
voyages
real
and
fictitious
part
of
a
very
miscellaneous
collection
of
books
made
by
my
father
it
was
a
melancholy
library
to
which
i
had
fallen
heir
most
of
the
missing
volumes
had
been
with
the
master
aboard
his
vessel
when
he
perished
of
an
early
edition
of
cook
s
voyages
all
the
volumes
were
now
absent
save
the
first
and
a
very
tantalizing
romance
in
four
volumes
radcliffe
s
mysteries
of
udolpho
represented
by
only
the
earlier
two
small
as
the
collection
was
it
contained
some
rare
books
the
rest
a
curious
little
volume
entitled
the
miracles
of
nature
and
art
to
which
we
find
johnson
referring
in
one
of
the
dialogues
chronicled
by
boswell
as
scarce
even
in
his
day
and
which
had
been
published
he
said
some
time
in
the
seventeenth
century
by
a
bookseller
whose
shop
hung
perched
on
old
london
bridge
between
sky
and
water
it
contained
too
the
only
copy
i
ever
saw
of
the
memoirs
of
a
protestant
condemned
to
the
galleys
of
france
for
his
religion
work
interesting
from
the
circumstance
that
though
it
bore
another
name
on
its
titlepage
it
had
been
translated
from
the
french
for
a
few
guineas
by
poor
goldsmith
in
his
days
of
obscure
literary
drudgery
and
exhibited
the
peculiar
excellences
of
his
style
the
collection
boasted
besides
of
a
curious
old
book
illustrated
by
very
uncouth
plates
that
detailed
the
perils
and
sufferings
of
an
english
sailor
who
had
spent
the
best
years
of
his
life
as
a
slave
in
morocco
it
had
its
volumes
of
sound
theology
too
and
of
stiff
controversy
s
works
and
henry
s
commentary
and
hutchinson
on
the
lesser
prophets
and
a
very
old
treatise
on
the
revelations
with
the
titlepage
away
and
blind
jameson
s
volume
on
the
hierarchy
with
first
editions
of
naphtali
the
cloud
of
witnesses
and
the
hind
let
loose
of
the
works
of
fact
and
incident
which
it
contained
those
of
the
voyages
were
my
special
favorites
i
perused
with
avidity
the
voyages
of
anson
drake
raleigh
dampier
and
captain
woods
rogers
and
my
mind
became
so
filled
with
conceptions
of
what
was
to
be
seen
and
done
in
foreign
parts
that
i
wished
myself
big
enough
to
be
a
sailor
that
i
might
go
and
see
coral
islands
and
burning
mountains
and
hunt
wild
beasts
and
fight
william
and
robert
chambers
the
founders
of
the
great
of
chambers
edinburgh
were
men
at
little
above
fourteen
years
of
age
writes
william
i
was
thrown
on
my
own
resources
from
necessity
not
less
than
from
choice
i
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
make
the
weekly
four
shillings
serve
for
everything
i
can
not
remember
entertaining
the
slightest
despondency
on
the
subject
i
made
such
attempts
as
were
at
all
practicable
while
an
apprentice
to
remedy
the
defects
of
my
education
at
school
nothing
in
that
way
could
be
done
in
the
shop
for
there
reading
was
proscribed
but
allowed
to
take
home
a
book
for
study
i
gladly
availed
myself
of
the
privilege
the
mornings
in
summer
when
light
cost
nothing
were
my
chief
reliance
fatigued
with
trudging
about
i
was
not
naturally
inclined
to
rise
but
on
this
and
some
other
points
i
overruled
the
will
and
forced
myself
to
rise
at
five
o
clock
and
have
a
spell
at
reading
until
it
was
time
to
think
of
moving
off
brother
when
he
was
with
me
doing
the
same
in
this
way
i
made
some
progress
in
french
with
the
pronunciation
of
which
i
was
already
familiar
from
the
speech
of
the
french
prisoners
of
war
at
peebles
i
likewise
dipped
into
several
books
of
solid
worth
as
smith
s
wealth
of
nations
locke
s
human
understanding
paley
s
moral
philosophy
and
blair
s
the
leading
facts
and
theories
in
my
memory
by
a
for
the
purpose
in
another
book
i
kept
for
years
an
accurate
account
of
my
expenses
not
allowing
a
single
halfpenny
to
escape
and
robert
the
younger
brother
confirms
the
story
with
even
more
accurate
attention
to
details
my
brother
william
and
i
he
says
lived
in
lodgings
together
our
room
and
bed
cost
three
shillings
a
week
i
used
to
be
in
great
distress
for
want
of
fire
i
could
not
afford
either
that
or
a
candle
myself
so
i
have
often
sat
by
my
landlady
s
kitchen
fire
fire
it
could
be
called
which
was
only
a
little
heap
of
embers
horace
and
conning
my
dictionary
by
a
light
which
required
me
to
hold
the
books
almost
close
to
the
grate
what
a
miserable
winter
that
was
yet
i
can
not
help
feeling
proud
of
my
trials
at
that
time
my
brother
and
then
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
i
between
thirteen
and
made
a
resolution
together
that
we
would
exercise
the
last
degree
of
my
brother
actually
saved
money
out
of
his
income
i
remember
seeing
him
take
shillings
out
of
a
closed
box
which
he
kept
to
receive
his
savings
and
that
was
the
spare
money
of
only
a
rev
robert
collyer
whose
name
is
known
and
honored
by
every
american
scholar
says
do
you
want
to
know
how
i
manage
to
talk
to
you
in
this
simple
saxon
i
will
tell
you
i
read
bunyan
crusoe
and
goldsmith
when
i
was
a
boy
morning
noon
and
night
all
the
rest
was
task
work
these
were
my
delight
with
the
stories
in
the
bible
and
with
shakspeare
when
at
last
the
mighty
master
came
within
our
doors
i
took
to
these
as
i
took
to
milk
and
without
the
least
idea
what
i
was
doing
got
the
taste
for
simple
words
into
the
very
fibre
of
my
nature
there
was
for
me
until
i
was
thirteen
years
old
and
then
i
had
to
turn
in
and
work
thirteen
hours
a
day
i
could
not
go
home
for
the
christmas
of
and
was
feeling
very
sad
about
it
all
for
i
was
only
a
boy
and
sitting
by
the
fire
an
old
farmer
came
in
and
said
i
notice
thou
s
fond
o
reading
so
i
brought
thee
summat
to
it
was
irving
s
sketch
i
had
never
heard
of
the
work
i
went
at
it
and
was
as
them
that
no
such
delight
had
touched
me
since
the
old
days
of
crusoe
i
saw
the
hudson
and
the
catskills
took
poor
rip
at
once
into
my
heart
as
everybody
has
pitied
ichabod
while
i
laughed
at
him
thought
the
old
dutch
feast
a
most
admirable
thing
and
long
before
i
was
through
all
regret
at
my
lost
christmas
had
gone
down
the
wind
and
i
had
found
out
there
are
books
and
books
that
vast
hunger
to
read
never
left
me
if
there
was
no
candle
i
poked
my
head
down
to
the
fire
read
while
i
was
eating
blowing
the
bellows
or
walking
from
one
place
to
another
i
could
read
and
walk
four
miles
an
hour
i
remember
while
i
was
yet
a
lad
reading
macaulay
s
great
essay
on
bacon
and
i
could
grasp
its
wonderful
beauty
now
give
a
boy
a
passion
like
this
for
anything
books
or
business
painting
or
farming
mechanism
or
music
and
you
give
him
thereby
a
lever
to
lift
his
world
and
a
patent
of
nobility
if
the
thing
he
does
is
it
may
be
questioned
whether
in
these
days
of
opportunities
it
would
be
possible
to
find
boys
of
thirteen
and
sixteen
who
would
be
able
to
read
understandingly
much
less
appreciate
and
enjoy
those
masterpieces
of
english
literature
so
eagerly
studied
by
franklin
and
hugh
miller
and
the
chambers
brothers
their
mental
appetites
have
been
treated
to
a
different
kind
of
diet
if
their
minds
have
not
been
dwarfed
and
stunted
by
indulgence
in
what
has
been
aptly
termed
their
tastes
have
been
perverted
and
the
growth
of
their
reasoning
powers
checked
by
being
fed
upon
the
stuff
recommended
as
harmless
literature
they
are
inveterate
devourers
of
stories
and
novels
and
the
worthless
material
which
is
recommended
as
good
reading
but
which
in
reality
is
nothing
but
a
discipline
of
better
that
children
should
not
read
at
all
than
read
much
of
that
which
passes
current
for
entertaining
reading
all
children
like
to
read
stories
the
love
of
the
story
in
some
form
or
other
is
indeed
a
characteristic
of
the
human
mind
and
exists
everywhere
in
all
conditions
of
life
but
stories
are
the
sweets
of
our
mental
existence
and
only
a
few
of
the
best
and
greatest
have
in
them
the
elements
which
will
lead
to
a
strong
and
vigorous
constant
feeding
upon
light
good
that
literature
may
be
in
debilitate
and
corrupt
the
mental
appetite
of
the
child
much
the
same
as
an
unrestrained
indulgence
in
jam
and
preserves
will
undermine
and
destroy
his
physical
health
in
either
case
if
no
result
more
serious
occurs
the
worst
forms
of
dyspepsia
will
follow
literary
dyspepsia
is
the
most
common
form
of
mental
disease
among
us
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
be
the
extent
of
its
influence
upon
american
civilization
fifty
per
cent
of
the
readers
who
patronize
our
great
public
libraries
have
weak
literary
stomachs
they
can
not
digest
anything
stronger
than
that
insipid
solution
the
last
society
novel
or
anything
purer
than
the
muddy
decoctions
poured
out
by
the
periodical
press
when
of
all
the
reading
done
in
a
public
library
eighty
per
cent
is
of
books
in
the
different
departments
of
fiction
i
doubt
whether
after
all
that
library
is
a
public
benefit
yet
this
is
but
the
natural
result
of
the
loose
habits
of
reading
which
we
encourage
among
our
children
and
cultivate
in
ourselves
habit
of
reading
anything
that
comes
to
hand
provided
only
that
it
is
entertaining
how
then
shall
we
so
order
the
child
s
reading
as
to
avoid
the
formation
of
desultory
and
aimless
habits
naturally
the
earliest
reading
is
the
story
short
straightforward
recitals
of
matters
of
daily
occurrence
of
the
doings
of
children
and
their
parents
their
friends
or
their
pets
the
nursery
a
little
magazine
published
in
boston
contains
an
excellent
variety
of
such
stories
now
and
then
we
may
pick
up
a
good
book
too
for
this
class
of
readers
but
there
are
many
worthless
books
here
as
elsewhere
and
careful
parents
will
look
well
into
that
which
they
buy
the
illuminated
covers
are
often
the
only
recommendation
of
books
of
this
kind
numbers
of
them
are
made
only
for
the
holiday
trade
the
illustrations
of
many
are
from
cuts
and
the
text
is
frequently
written
to
fit
the
illustrations
a
pure
fresh
book
for
a
little
child
is
a
treasure
to
be
sought
for
and
appreciated
very
early
in
comes
the
period
of
a
belief
in
fairies
and
the
reading
of
is
to
children
a
very
proper
nay
a
very
necessary
thing
i
pity
the
boy
or
girl
who
must
grow
up
without
having
made
intimate
acquaintance
with
mother
goose
and
the
wonderful
stories
of
jack
the
and
blue
beard
and
cinderella
and
those
other
strange
tales
as
old
as
the
race
itself
and
yet
new
to
every
succeeding
generation
they
are
a
part
of
the
inheritance
of
the
people
and
belong
as
a
kind
of
birthright
to
every
intelligent
child
as
your
little
reader
advances
in
knowledge
and
he
should
be
treated
to
stronger
food
grimm
s
household
stories
and
the
delightful
wonder
stories
of
hans
christian
andersen
should
form
a
part
of
the
library
of
every
child
as
he
passes
through
the
period
of
his
life
nor
can
we
well
omit
to
give
him
charles
kingsley
s
water
babies
and
alice
s
adventures
in
and
now
or
later
as
circumstances
shall
dictate
we
may
introduce
him
to
that
prince
of
all
the
arabian
nights
entertainment
in
an
edition
carefully
adapted
to
children
s
reading
the
tales
related
in
this
book
are
not
ours
by
birth
but
they
have
nevertheless
taken
their
place
amongst
the
similar
things
of
our
own
which
constitute
the
national
literary
inheritance
altogether
it
is
a
glorious
book
and
one
to
which
we
can
not
well
show
enough
of
and
while
your
reader
lingers
in
the
great
world
of
poetic
fancy
and
let
him
revel
for
a
while
in
those
enchanting
idyls
and
myths
which
delighted
mankind
when
the
race
was
young
and
this
earth
was
indeed
a
these
he
may
find
apparelled
in
a
dress
adapted
to
our
modern
notions
of
propriety
in
hawthorne
s
wonder
book
and
tanglewood
tales
in
kingsley
s
greek
heroes
and
in
a
more
prosaic
form
in
cox
s
tales
of
ancient
greece
and
in
the
story
of
siegfried
and
later

he
may
read
the
no
less
charming
myths
of
our
own
northern
ancestors
and
the
legend
of
the
nibelungen
heroes
then
by
a
natural
transition
you
advance
into
the
which
lies
between
the
world
of
pure
fancy
and
the
domains
of
reality
you
introduce
your
reader
to
some
wholesome
adaptations
of
those
mediæval
romances
which
with
their
one
grain
of
fact
to
a
thousand
of
fable
gave
such
noble
delight
to
lords
and
ladies
in
the
days
of
chivalry
these
you
will
find
in
sidney
lanier
s
boy
s
king
arthur
and
boy
s
mabinogion
in
the
story
of
roland
by
the
author
of
the
present
volume
and
in
bulfinch
s
legends
of
charlemagne
and
the
age
of
do
you
understand
now
to
what
point
you
have
led
your
young
reader
you
have
simply
followed
the
order
of
nature
and
of
human
development
and
you
have
imperceptibly
even
to
him
out
of
the
world
of
and
through
the
middle
ground
of
chivalric
romance
to
the
very
borders
of
the
domains
of
history
he
is
ready
and
eager
to
enter
into
the
realms
of
truth
but
i
would
not
advise
undue
haste
in
this
matter
the
mediæval
romances
have
inspired
him
with
a
desire
to
know
more
of
those
days
when
rode
over
sea
and
land
to
do
battle
in
the
name
of
god
and
for
the
honor
of
their
king
the
church
and
the
ladies
he
wants
to
know
something
more
nearly
the
truth
than
that
which
the
minstrels
and
of
the
middle
ages
can
tell
him
and
yet
he
is
not
prepared
for
a
sudden
transition
from
romance
to
history
let
him
read
ivanhoe
then
give
him
howard
pyle
s
story
of
robin
hood
and
lanier
s
boy
s
percy
and
if
you
care
to
allow
him
so
much
more
fiction
let
him
read
madame
colomb
s
franchise
as
translated
and
adapted
by
davenport
adams
in
his
page
squire
and
can
you
withhold
history
longer
from
your
reader
i
think
not
he
will
demand
some
authentic
knowledge
of
richard
the
and
of
king
john
and
of
the
saxons
and
normans
and
of
the
crusades
and
of
the
saracens
and
of
charlemagne
and
his
peers
lose
not
your
opportunity
but
pass
over
with
your
pupil
into
the
promised
land
the
transition
is
easy
in
fact
leaving
fiction
and
the
story
behind
you
you
enter
the
fields
of
truth
and
history
as
for
books
it
is
difficult
now
to
advise
but
there
are
abbott
s
little
histories
him
the
history
of
richard
to
begin
with
then
get
the
whole
set
for
him
yonge
s
young
folks
history
of
england
or
dickens
s
child
s
history
will
also
be
in
demand
the
way
is
easy
now
the
road
is
open
you
need
no
further
keep
straight
ahead
there
are
other
books
of
course
which
the
young
reader
will
find
in
his
way
and
which
it
is
altogether
proper
and
necessary
that
he
should
read
for
instance
there
is
robinson
crusoe
without
a
knowledge
of
which
the
boy
loses
one
of
his
dearest
enjoyments
how
youth
passed
long
ago
when
there
was
no
crusoe
to
waft
it
away
in
fancy
to
the
pacific
and
fix
it
upon
the
lonely
doings
of
the
shipwrecked
mariner
is
inconceivable
but
we
can
readily
suppose
that
it
must
have
been
different
says
robert
chambers
and
no
substitute
for
the
original
robinson
will
answer
not
one
of
the
ten
thousand
tales
of
adventure
recently
published
for
boys
will
fill
the
niche
which
this
book
fills
or
atone
in
the
least
for
any
neglect
of
its
merits
the
swiss
family
robinson
approaches
nearest
in
excellence
to
defoe
s
immortal
creation
and
may
very
profitably
form
a
part
of
every
boy
s
or
girl
s
library
then
among
the
really
unexceptionable
books
of
the
healthful
hopeful
truthful
sort
i
may
name
tom
brown
s
school
days
at
rugby
lamb
s
tales
from
shakspeare
mitchell
s
about
old
the
inimitable
bodley
books
bayard
taylor
s
boys
of

countries
abbott
s
franconia
stories
and
a
few
others
in
the
line
of
history
or
travels
to
be
mentioned
in
future
chapters
these
i
believe
to
be
in
every
sense
proper
wholesome
books
free
from
all
kinds
of
mannerisms
free
from
improper
language
free
from
sickly
sentiment
and
gush
and
these
if
not
the
most
instructive
books
are
the
sort
of
books
which
the
child
or
youth
should
read
as
a
kind
of
relish
or
supplement
to
the
more
methodical
course
of
reading
which
i
have
elsewhere
indicated
in
this
careful
direction
of
the
child
s
reading
and
in
the
cultivation
of
his
literary
taste
if
you
have
succeeded
in
bringing
him
to
the
point
which
we
have
indicated
you
have
done
much
towards
forming
his
character
for
life
there
is
little
danger
that
bad
books
will
ever
possess
any
attractions
for
him
he
will
henceforth
be
apt
to
go
right
of
his
own
accord
preferring
the
wholesome
and
the
true
to
any
of
the
flashy
allurements
of
the
literary
slums
and
which
so
abound
and
flourish
in
these
days
but
perhaps
the
fundamental
error
in
determining
what
books
children
shall
read
lies
in
the
very
popular
notion
that
to
read
much
and
to
derive
pleasure
and
profit
from
our
reading
many
books
are
necessary
and
the
greatest
obstacle
in
the
way
of
forming
and
directing
a
proper
taste
for
good
reading
is
to
be
found
not
in
the
scarcity
but
in
the
superabundance
of
reading
matter
the
great
flood
of
periodical
literature
for
young
people
is
the
worst
hindrance
to
the
formation
of
right
habits
in
reading
some
of
these
periodicals
are
simply
unadulterated
pen
poison
designed
not
only
to
enrich
their
projectors
but
to
deprave
the
minds
of
those
who
read
others
are
published
doubtless
from
pure
motives
and
with
the
best
intentions
but
being
managed
by
inexperienced
or
incapable
editors
they
are
at
the
best
but
thin
dilutions
of
literature
leading
to
mental
imbecility
and
starvation
the
periodicals
fit
to
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
reading
children
may
be
numbered
on
half
your
fingers
and
even
these
should
not
be
read
without
due
discrimination
too
great
a
variety
of
books
or
papers
placed
at
the
disposal
of
inexperienced
readers
offers
a
premium
to
desultoriness
and
fosters
and
encourages
the
habit
of
devouring
every
species
of
literary
food
that
comes
to
hand
hence
we
should
beware
not
only
of
the
bad
but
of
too
great
plenty
of
the
good
the
benefit
of
a
right
good
book
says
hudson
all
depends
upon
this
that
its
virtue
just
into
the
mind
and
there
become
a
living
generative
force
to
be
running
and
rambling
over
a
great
many
books
tasting
a
little
here
a
little
there
and
tying
up
with
none
is
good
for
nothing
nay
worse
than
nothing
such
a
process
of
unceasing
change
is
also
a
discipline
of
perpetual
emptiness
the
right
method
in
the
culture
of
the
mind
is
to
take
a
few
choice
books
and
weave
about
them
the
fixed
delights
of
house
and
home
friendship
that
will
not
break
and
love
that

hints
on
the
formation
of
school
libraries
what
sort
of
reading
are
our
schools
planting
an
appetite
for
are
they
really
doing
anything
to
instruct
and
form
the
mental
taste
so
that
the
pupils
on
leaving
them
may
be
safely
left
to
choose
their
reading
for
themselves
it
is
clear
in
evidence
that
they
are
far
from
educating
the
young
to
take
pleasure
in
what
is
intellectually
noble
and
sweet
the
statistics
of
our
public
libraries
show
that
some
cause
is
working
mightily
to
prepare
them
only
for
delight
in
what
is
both
morally
and
intellectually
mean
and
foul
it
would
not
indeed
be
fair
to
charge
our
public
schools
with
positively
giving
this
preparation
but
it
is
their
business
to
forestall
and
prevent
such
a
result
if
along
with
the
faculty
of
reading
they
can
not
also
impart
some
safeguards
of
taste
and
habit
against
such
a
result
will
the
system
prove
a
success
hudson
much
is
being
said
about
the
utility
of
school
libraries
and
in
some
instances
much
if
not
entirely
misdirected
labor
is
being
expended
in
their
formation
public
libraries
are
not
necessarily
public
benefits
and
school
libraries
unless
carefully
selected
and
judiciously
managed
will
not
prove
to
be
unmixed
blessings
there
are
several
questions
which
teachers
and
school
officers
should
seriously
consider
before
setting
themselves
to
the
task
of
establishing
a
library
and
no
teacher
who
is
not
himself
a
knower
of
books
and
a
reader
should
presume
to
regulate
and
direct
the
reading
of
others
what
are
the
objects
of
a
school
library
they
are
twofold
first
to
aid
in
cultivating
a
taste
for
good
reading
second
to
supply
materials
for
supplementary
study
and
independent
research
now
neither
of
these
objects
can
be
attained
unless
your
library
is
composed
of
books
selected
especially
with
reference
to
the
capabilities
and
needs
of
your
pupils
dealing
as
you
do
with
pupils
of
various
degrees
of
intellectual
strength
warped
by
every
variety
of
moral
influence
and
home
training
the
cultivation
of
a
taste
for
good
reading
among
them
is
no
small
matter
to
do
this
your
library
must
contain
none
but
truly
good
books
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
every
collection
of
books
placed
in
a
schoolhouse
is
a
library
and
yet
that
is
the
name
which
is
applied
to
many
very
inferior
collections
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
these
libraries
composed
altogether
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
literature
donations
entirely
worthless
to
their
donors
of
of
patent
office
reports
and
other
public
documents
and
of
the
dilapidated
remains
of
some
older
and
equally
worthless
collection
of
books
and
with
these
you
talk
about
cultivating
a
taste
for
good
reading
one
really
good
book
a
single
copy
of
st
nicholas
is
worth
more
than
all
this
trash
get
it
out
of
sight
at
once
the
value
of
a
matter
for
what
purpose
it
has
been
not
upon
the
number
of
its
books
but
upon
their
character
and
so
the
first
rule
to
be
observed
in
the
formation
of
a
school
library
is
buy
it
at
first
hand
even
though
you
should
begin
with
a
single
volume
and
shun
all
kinds
of
donations
unless
they
be
donations
of
cash
or
books
of
unquestionable
value
in
selecting
books
for
purchase
you
will
have
an
eye
singly
to
the
wants
of
the
students
who
are
to
use
them
a
school
library
should
be
in
no
sense
a
public
circulating
library
you
can
not
cater
to
the
literary
tastes
of
the
public
and
at
the
same
time
serve
the
best
interests
of
your
pupils
books
relating
to
history
to
biography
and
to
travel
will
form
a
very
large
portion
of
your
library
these
should
be
chosen
with
reference
to
the
age
and
mental
capacity
of
those
who
are
to
read
them
no
book
should
be
bought
merely
because
it
is
a
good
book
but
because
we
know
that
it
can
be
made
useful
in
the
attainment
of
certain
desired
ends
the
courses
of
reading
indicated
in
the
following
chapters
of
this
work
it
is
hoped
will
assist
you
largely
in
making
a
wise
selection
as
well
as
in
directing
to
a
judicious
use
of
books
for
the
selection
of
a
book
is
only
half
of
your
duty
the
profitable
use
of
it
is
the
other
half
and
this
lesson
should
be
early
taught
to
your
pupils
if
through
means
of
your
school
library
or
otherwise
you
succeed
in
enlisting
the
interest
of
a
young
person
in
profitable
methodical
reading
you
have
accomplished
a
great
deal
towards
the
forwarding
of
his
education
and
the
formation
of
his
character
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
a
boy
of
twelve
can
not
pursue
a
course
of
reading
in
english
history
if
properly
directed
and
encouraged
he
will
enjoy
it
far
better
than
the
perusal
of
the
which
under
the
guise
of
harmless
juvenile
literature
have
been
placed
in
his
hands
by
teachers
or
parents
in
a
former
chapter
i
have
shown
you
how
with
a
library
of
only
fifty
volumes
you
may
have
in
your
possession
the
very
best
of
all
that
the
world
s
have
ever
written
as
i
have
said
for
study
and
meditation
and
mind
growth
enough
for
a
lifetime
such
a
library
is
worth
more
than
ten
thousand
volumes
of
the
ordinary
popular
kind
of
books
so
also
the
reading
of
a
very
few
books
carefully
and
methodically
by
your
constant
presence
of
the
very
best
books
in
our
language
and
the
exclusion
of
the
trashy
and
the
give
them
more
real
enjoyment
and
infinitely
greater
profit
than
the
desultory
or
hasty
reading
of
many
volumes
a
small
library
is
to
be
despised
only
when
it
contains
inferior
books

courses
of
reading
in
geography
and
natural
history
geography
is
learned
best
by
the
careful
reading
of
books
of
travel
pupils
would
derive
infinitely
more
knowledge
by
the
use
under
judicious
instructors
of
a
library
of
this
sort
than
by
years
of
drudging
through
those
masses
of
inanity
known
as
school
geographies
the
following
list
is
designed
chiefly
to
aid
teachers
in
the
selection
of
books
suitable
for
geographical
study
at
school
and
to
assist
private
readers
in
the
choice
of
useful
and
entertaining
works
on
the
various
subjects
of
interest
in
our
own
and
foreign
countries
a
good
atlas
is
the
first
desideratum
and
is
an
indispensable
auxiliary
to
the
course
of
reading
here
indicated
rand
mcnally
s
atlas
is
one
of
the
latest
publications
and
perhaps
the
most
accurate

complete
in
the

this
kind
we
may

gray

theodore
parker
the
hardest
way
of
learning
is
by
easy
reading
every
man
that
tries
it
finds
it
and
apropos
of
this
i
present
the
following
list
of
books
recommended
by
john
brown
as
suitable
for
the
reading
of
young
medical
students
yet
not
only
medical
students
but
students
of
other
special
subjects
and
teachers
as
well
will
find
it
profitable
to
dig
into
and
through
to
energize
upon
and
master
such
books
as
arnauld
s
port
royal
logic
translated
by
baynes
thomson
s
outlines
of
the
necessary
laws
of
thought
descartes
on
the
method
of
rightly
conducting
the
reason
and
seeking
truth
in
the
sciences

locke
on
the
conduct
of
the
understanding
taking
up
a
book
like
arnauld
and
reading
a
chapter
of
his
lively
manly
sense
says
rab
s
friend
is
like
throwing
your
manuals
and
scalpels
and
microscopes
and
natural
most
unnatural
orders
out
of
your
hand
and
head
and
taking
a
game
with
the
grange
club
or
a
run
to
the
top
of
arthur
seat
exertion
quickens
your
pulse
expands
your
lungs
makes
your
blood
warmer
and
redder
fills
your
mouth
with
the
pure
waters
of
relish
strengthens
and
supples
your
legs
and
though
on
your
way
to
the
top
you
may
encounter
rocks
and
baffling
débris
and
gusts
of
fierce
winds
rushing
out
upon
you
from
behind
corners
just
as
you
will
find
in
arnauld
and
all
truly
serious
and
honest
books
of
the
kind
difficulties
and
puzzles
winds
of
doctrine
and
deceitful
mists
still
you
are
rewarded
at
the
top
by
the
wide
view
you
see
as
from
a
tower
the
end
of
all
you
look
into
the
perfections
and
relations
of
things
you
see
the
clouds
the
bright
lights
and
the
everlasting
hills
on
the
horizon
you
come
down
the
hill
a
happier
a
better
and
a
hungrier
man
and
of
a
better
mind
but
as
we
said
you
must
eat
the
book
must
crush
it
and
cut
it
with
your
teeth
and
swallow
it
just
as
you
must
walk
up
and
not
be
carried
up
the
hill
much
less
imagine
you
are
there
or
look
upon
a
picture
of
what
you
would
see
were
you
up
however
accurately
or
artistically
done
no
yourself
must
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
books
that
are
the
most
truly
helpful
to
us
and
it
is
the
hard
reading
that
profits
most
provided
always
that
due
care
be
taken
to
digest
that
which
is
read
yet
i
would
not
recommend
the
same
strong
diet
or
the
same
severe
exercise
to
every
person
or
even
to
any
considerable
proportion
of
readers
one
man
may
be
a
palm
as
says
collyer
and
another
a
pine
that
which
is
wisdom
to
the
one
may
be
incomprehensible
folly
to
the
other
but
those
whose
mental
constitutions
are
sufficiently
vigorous
to
digest
and
assimilate
the
food
which
the
philosophers
offer
may
find
comfort
and
health

a
course
of
reading
which
shall
include
any
number
of
the
works
here
mentioned
will
be
no
child
s
play
it
will
involve
the
severest
exercise
of
the
thinking
powers
but
it
will
enable
you
to
look
into
the
perfections
and
relations
of
things
and
to
see
the
clouds
the
bright
lights
and
the
everlasting
hills
on
the
the
reading
of
such
books
is
like
the
training
of
a
gymnast
it
will
lead
to
the
healthy
development
of
the
parts
most
skillfully
exercised
but
the
strength
of
him
who
exercises
should
never
be
too
severely
tested
would
you
prefer
a
lighter
course
of
reading
but
one
which
will
probably
lead
you
into
pleasanter
paths
of
contemplation
and
reflection
and
finally
open
up
to
your
view
a
prospect
equally
boundless
and
grand
allow
me
to
suggest
the
following
which
is
neither
philosophical
nor
religious
in
the
strictest
acceptation
of
these
terms
but
which
leads
us
to
an
acquaintance
with
that
which
is
best
in
both
we
shall
begin
with
the
bible
and
throughout
the
course
we
shall
make
that
book
our
grand
read
the
bible
reverently
and
attentively
says
sir
matthew
hale
set
your
heart
upon
it
and
lay
it
up
in
your
memory
and
make
it
the
direction
of
your
life
it
will
make
you
a
wise
and
good
from
the
reverential
reading
of
the
bible
which
to
most
of
us
is
rather
an
act
of
religious
duty
than
of
intellectual
effort
we
turn
to
the
great
masterpieces
of
antiquity
in
the
phædo
and
the
apology
and
crito
of
plato
we
find
the
ripest
thoughts
of
the
world
s
greatest
thinker
then
we
turn
to
aristotle
s
ethics
and
afterwards
we
compare
the
doctrines
of
the
greek
philosophers
with
the
teachings
of
confucius
and
of
mencius
if
we
have
supplemented
these
readings
with
the
proper
acquaintance
with
ancient
history
we
shall
now
be
ready
to
understand
the
great
poems
of
antiquity
and
to
read
them
in
a
light
different
from
that
which
we
have
hitherto
known
we
read
the
iliad
and
the
odyssey
and
the
greek
tragedians
then
the
old
indian
epics
arnold
s
the
light
of
asia
and
swamy
s
dialogues
and
discourses
of
gotama
descending
now
to
more
modern
times
we
would
not
make
this
course
a
long
one
turn
again
to
our
bible
and
thoroughly
acquaint
ourselves
with
the
unsurpassedly
simple
loving
perfect
idyls
of
the
life
and
death
of
christ
as
we
find
them
in
the
new
testament
after
this
we
shall
obtain
more
exalted
ideas
of
the
brotherhood
of
the
human
race
and
the
hope
of
the
nations
if
we
spend
some
time
in
the
study
of
the
majestic
expressions
of
the
universal
conscience
found
in
such
works
as
the
vishnu
sarma
of
the
hindoos
the
gulistan
of
saadi
the
sentences
of
epictetus
and
the
thoughts
of
marcus
aurelius
antoninus
then
to
get
at
the
poetic
interpretation
of
the
teachings
of
mohammed
we
read
the
pearls
of
faith
or
islam
s
rosary
and
lane
poole
s
selections
from
the
returning
to
the
study
of
christian
ethics
and
poetry
we
take
up
the
confessions
of
saint
augustine
and
the
discourse
of
saint
bernard
and
then
the
imitation
of
christ
by
thomas
à
kempis
we
read
milton
s
paradise
lost
again
and
bunyan
s
pilgrim
s
progress
and
we
enjoy
the
wealth
of
imagery
in
jeremy
taylor
s
holy
living
and
holy
holy
george
herbert
s
sacred
poems
and
private
ejaculations
claim
our
attention
for
a
time
and
then
we
take
up
pascal
s
thoughts
and
selections
from
fénelon
s
telemachus
and
dialogues
of
the
finally
we
read
wordsworth
s
excursion
and
keble
s
christian
year
and
return
after
all
to
a
further
perusal
of
the
bible
and
the
poems
of
antiquity
you
may
say
that
this
course
is
rather
fragmentary
and
so
it
is
but
it
differs
from
the
other
courses
which
i
have
indicated
in
that
it
is
undertaken
as
a
rather
than
a
unlike
the
course
just
preceding
it
has
to
do
with
our
emotional
and
devotional
natures
rather
than
with
our
highest
powers
of
thinking
and
reasoning
with
few
exceptions
only
the
books
here
mentioned
are
voices
out
of
the
past
speaking
to
us
of
the
human
soul
s
belief
and
experience
in
different
ages
of
the
world
and
under
different
dispensations
i
suppose
says
george
eliot
speaking
of
the
imitation
of
christ
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
the
small
book
for
which
you
need
only
pay
sixpence
at
a
works
miracles
to
this
day
turning
bitter
waters
into
sweetness
while
expensive
sermons
and
treatises
newly
issued
leave
all
things
as
they
were
before
it
was
written
down
by
a
hand
that
waited
for
the
heart
s
prompting
it
is
the
chronicle
of
a
solitary
hidden
anguish
struggle
trust
and
triumph
written
on
velvet
cushions
to
teach
endurance
to
those
who
are
treading
with
bleeding
feet
on
the
stones
and
so
it
remains
to
all
time
a
lasting
record
of
human
needs
and
human
consolations
the
voice
of
a
brother
who
ages
ago
felt
and
suffered
and
renounced
the
cloister
perhaps
with
serge
gown
and
tonsured
head
with
much
chanting
and
long
fasts
and
with
a
fashion
of
speech
different
from
ours
under
the
same
silent
heavens
and
with
the
same
passionate
desires
the
same
strivings
the
same
failures
the
same
writing
of
works
like
these
emerson
says
their
communications
are
not
to
be
given
or
taken
with
the
lips
and
the
end
of
the
tongue
but
out
of
the
glow
of
the
cheek
and
with
the
throbbing
heart
these
are
the
scriptures
which
the
missionary
might
well
carry
over
prairie
desert
and
ocean
to
siberia
japan
timbuctoo
yet
he
will
find
that
the
spirit
which
is
in
them
journeys
faster
than
he
and
greets
him
on
his
arrival
there
long
before
him
the
missionary
must
be
carried
by
it
and
find
it
there
or
he
goes
in
vain
is
there
any
geography
in
these
things
we
call
them
asiatic
we
call
them
primeval
but
perhaps
that
is
only
optical
for
nature
is
always
equal
to
herself
and
there
are
as
good
eyes
and
ears
now
in
the
planet
as
ever
were
only
these
ejaculations
of
the
soul
are
uttered
one
or
a
few
at
a
time
at
long
intervals
and
it
takes
millenniums
to
make
a
we
are
brought
now
naturally
to
the
subject
of
theological
literature
the
number
of
books
in
this
department
is
very
great
and
there
are
wide
differences
of
opinion
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
many
of
the
works

select
always

judicious

when

may

this

is
equally
removed

barren

of
the
utilitarian
sophists

from
the
petty
craft
so
often
mistaken
for
statesmanship
by
minds
grown

chapter
xi
on
the
practical
study
of
english
literature
the
ocean
of
literature
is
without
limit
how
then
shall
we
be
able
to
perform
a
voyage
even
to
a
moderate
distance
if
we
waste
our
time
in
dalliance
on
the
shore
our
only
hope
is
in
exertion
let
our
only
reward
be
that
of
the
student
of
english
literature
has
indeed
embarked
upon
a
limitless
ocean
a
lifetime
of
study
will
serve
only
to
make
him
acquainted
with
parts
of
that
great
expanse
which
lies
open
before
him
he
should
pursue
his
explorations
earnestly
and
with
the
inquiring
spirit
of
a
true
discoverer
his
thirst
for
knowledge
should
be
unquenchable
he
should
long
always
for
that
mind
food
which
brings
the
right
kind
of
mind
growth
he
should
not
rest
satisfied
with
merely
superficial
attainments
but
should
strive
for
that
thoroughness
of
knowledge
without
which
there
can
be
neither
excellence
nor
enjoyment
english
literature
is
not
to
be
learned
from
manuals
they
are
only
helps
buoys
if
you
will
call
them
so
or
they
serve
to
you
the
purposes
of
what
do
you
think
of
the
tourist
who
stays
at
home
and
studies
his
baedeker
with
the
foolish
thought
that
he
is
actually
seeing
the
countries
which
the
book
describes
and
yet
i
have
known
students
and
not
a
few
teachers
do
a
thing
equally
as
foolish
with
a
morley
or
a
shaw
or
even
a
brooke
in
their
hands
and
a
few
names
and
dates
at
their
tongues
ends
they
imagine
themselves
viewing
the
great
ocean
of
literature
ploughing
its
surface
and
exploring
its
depths
when
in
reality
they
are
only
wasting
their
time
in
dalliance
on
the
english
literature
does
not
consist
in
a
mere
array
of
names
and
dates
and
short
biographical
sketches
of
men
who
have
written
books
biography
is
biography
literature
is
a
record
of
the
best
but
the
former
is
frequently
studied
in
place
of
the
latter
for
once
that
we
take
down
our
milton
and
read
a
book
of
that
voice
as
wordsworth
says
whose
sound
is
like
the
sea
we
take
up
fifty
times
a
magazine
with
something
about
milton
or
about
milton
s
grandmother
or
a
book
stuffed
with
curious
facts
about
the
houses
in
which
he
lived
and
the
juvenile
ailments
of
his
first
instead
of
becoming
acquainted
at
first
hand
with
books
in
which
are
stored
the
energies
of
the
past
we
content
ourselves
with
knowing
only
something
about
the
men
who
wrote
them
instead
of
admiring
with
our
own
eyes
the
architectural
beauties
of
paul
s
cathedral
we
read
a
biography
of
sir
christopher
wren
again
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
literature
is
one
thing
and
the
history
of
literature
is
another
the
study
of
the
latter
however
important
can
not
be
substituted
for
that
of
the
former
yet
it
is
not
desirable
to
separate
the
two
to
acquire
any
serviceable
knowledge
of
a
book
you
will
be
greatly
aided
by
knowing
under
what
peculiar
conditions
it
was
conceived
and
produced
history
of
the
country
the
manners
of
the
people
the
status
of
morals
and
politics
at
the
time
it
was
written
between
history
and
literature
there
is
a
mutual
relationship
which
should
not
be
overlooked
a
book
is
the
offspring
of
the
aggregate
intellect
of
humanity
and
it
gives
back
to
humanity
in
the
shape
of
new
ideas
and
new
combinations
of
old
ideas
not
only
all
that
which
it
has
derived
from
it
but
more
intellectual
vitality
and
springs
of
action
hitherto
unknown
in
the
study
of
literature
one
should
begin
with
an
author
and
with
a
subject
not
too
difficult
to
understand
a
beginner
will
be
likely
to
find
but
little
comfort
in
chaucer
or
spenser
or
even
in
emerson
but
after
he
has
worked
up
to
them
he
may
study
them
with
unbounded
delight
for
a
ready
understanding
and
correct
appreciation
of
the
great
masterpieces
of
english
literature
a
knowledge
of
greek
and
roman
mythology
and
history
is
almost
indispensable
the
student
will
find
the
courses
of
historical
reading
given
in
a
former
chapter
of
this
book
of
much
value
in
supplementing
his
literary
studies
the
great
works
of
the
world
s
should
be
studied
together
with
reference
to
the
similarity
of
their
for
example
the
reading
of
shakspeare
will
give
occasion
to
the
study
of
dramatic
literature
in
all
its
forms
the
reading
of
milton
s
paradise
lost
will
introduce
us
to
the
great
epics
and
to
heroic
poetry
in
general
sir

introduces
us
to

lycidas
to

and

poetry
and
to
know
the
best
specimens
of
argumentative
prose

begin
with
the
speeches
of

and

with

the

study
of

departments
of
english
literature
have
been

both
with
private
students
and
with
classes

many
of
the
books
mentioned
are
to

used

as
works

some
of

may
be
conveniently
omitted
