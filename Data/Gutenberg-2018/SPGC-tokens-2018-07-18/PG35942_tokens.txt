my
dear
governor
it
was
ordered
by
the
franchises
of
destiny
that
you
become
the
chief
executive
of
a
state
in
which
the
telling
of
tales
brightened
the
hunter
and
cheered
the
lonely
cabin
before
our
people
learned
the
uses
of
ink
and
the
supreme
fitness
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
are
yourself
the
best
of
and
entitled
for
your
excellence
in
this
particular
as
well
as
for
weightier
reasons
to
sit
at
the

of
the
table
in
that
commonwealth
to
which
we
are
both
bound
by

dear

the

your

many

balancings

my
friend
wiggins
is
introduced
i
dined
with
hartley
wiggins
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
on
an
evening
in
october
not
very
long
ago
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
the
hare
and
tortoise
is
the
smallest
and
most
select
of
clubs
whose
windows
afford
a
pleasant
view
of
gramercy
park
the
club
is
comparatively
young
and
it
is
our
joke
that
we
are
so
far
all
tortoises
creeping
through
our
several
professions
without
aid
from
any
hare
i
hasten
to
explain
that
i
am
a
chimney
doctor
wiggins
is
a
lawyer
at
least
i
have
seen
his
name
in
a
list
of
graduates
of
the
harvard
law
school
and
he
has
an
office
where
i
have
occasionally
found
him
sedately
playing
solitaire
while
he
waited
for
some
one
to
take
him
out
to
luncheon
he
spends
his
summers
on
a
south
dakota
ranch
from
which
he
derives
a
considerable
income
when
tough
steaks
are
served
from
the
club
grill
we
always
attribute
them
to
the
cattle
on
hills
or
if
the
lamb
is
ancient
we
declare
it
to
be
of
shepherding
it
is
the
way
of
our
humor
to
hold
wiggins
responsible
for
things
his
good
nature
is
usually
equal
to
the
worst
we
can
do
to
him
he
is
the
kind
of
fellow
that
one
instinctively
indicts
without
hearing
testimony
we
all
know
perfectly
well
that
wiggins
ranch
is
a
wheat
ranch
wiggins
is
an
athlete
and
his
summers
in
the
west
and
persistent
training
during
the
winter
in
town
keep
him
in
fine
condition
as
i
faced
him
in
our
favorite
corner
of
the
hare
and
tortoise
the
physical
man
was
fit
enough
but
i
saw
at
once
that
he
was
glum
and
dispirited
he
had
through
many
years
honored
me
with
his
confidence
and
i
felt
that
after
we
got
well
started
i
should
hear
what
was
on
his
mind
i
hoped
to
cheer
him
with
the
story
of
a
visit
i
had
by
chance
paid
that
afternoon
to
the
asolando
for
though
wiggins
is
a
most
practical
person
i
imagined
that
he
would
be
diverted
by
my
description
of
a
place
which
i
felt
sure
nothing
could
tempt
him
to
visit
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
he
gave
me
when
i
remarked
at
about
his
third
spoonful
of
soup
by
the
way
i
dropped
into
an
odd
place
this
afternoon
buns
maccaroons
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
they
call
it
the
asolando
i
was
ambling
on
expecting
to
sharpen
his
curiosity
gradually
as
i
recited
the
joys
of
the
but
at
asolando
his
spoon
dropped
and
he
stared
at
me
blankly
it
should
be
known
that
wiggins
is
not
a
man
whose
composure
is
lightly
shaken
the
waiter
who
served
us
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
a
fact
which
i
mention
merely
to
confirm
my
assertion
that
the
dropping
of
a
spoon
into
his
soup
was
an
extraordinary
occurrence
in
wiggins
life
wiggins
was
a
proper
person
on
the
ranch
twenty
miles
from
a
railroad
he
always
dressed
for
dinner
the
asolando
i
repeated
to
break
the
spell
of
his
blank
stare
know
the
place
he
recovered
in
a
moment
but
he
surveyed
me
quizzically
before
replying
of
course
i
have
heard
of
the
asolando
but
i
thought
you
did
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
it
a
trifle
girlish
you
know
that
hardly
against
it
i
found
the
girlishness
altogether
attractive
you
always
were
tolerably
susceptible
but
broiled
butterflies
and
soufflé
seem
to
me
rather
pale
food
for
a
man
in
your
vigorous
health
they
must
have
discriminated
in
your
favor
i
saw
no
such
things
though
to
be
sure
i
was
afraid
to
quibble
over
the
suggestions
may
i
ask
when
you
were
there
oh
i
dropped
in
quite
accidentally
one
day
last
spring
i
saw
the
sign
and
remembered
that
somebody
had
spoken
of
the
place
and
i
was
tired
and
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
club
and
dissimulation
is
not
an
art
as
wiggins
attempts
to
practice
it
at
times
he
is
by
nature
the
most
straightforward
of
mortals
it
was
clear
that
he
was
withholding
something
and
i
resolved
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
do
think
the
asolando
is
a
place
that
would
attract
either
of
us
and
yet
the
viands
are
good
as
such
stuff
goes
and
the
gentle
are
restful
to
the
eye
pippa
francesca
gloria
and
the
rest
of
wiggins
pried
open
his
artichoke
with
the
care
of
a
botanist
he
had
regained
his
composure
but
i
saw
that
the
subject
interested
him
you
were
there
this
afternoon
he
inquired
yes
my
first
and
only
appearance
and
this
is
monday
the
calendar
has
said
it
so
you
settled
your
bill
with
pippa
i
believe
this
was
her
day
then
you
really
do
know
the
inner
workings
of
the
asolando
i
continued
i
thought
you
would
show
your
hand
presently
then
it
is
perhaps
gloria
beatrice
or
francesca
who
minds
the
till
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
alternating
with
pippa
who
took
my
coin
it
a
pretty
idea
it
has
the
delicacy
of
an
arrangement
by
whistler
or
the
charm
of
a
line
in
rossetti
so
you
have
seen
the
blessed
damozel
at
the
on
the
contrary
i
was
never
there
on
tuesday
thursday
or
saturday
and
i
therefore
passed
no
coin
to
francesca
gloria
or
beatrice
my
only
visit
was
on
a
day
last
may
and
my
recollection
of
the
system
is
doubtless
imperfect
then
beyond
doubt
i
saw
pippa
she
makes
the
change
on
monday
wednesday
and
friday
her
eyelashes
are
a
trifle
too
long
for
the
world
peace
i
dare
say
i
have
your
charming
knack
ames
of
picking
up
acquaintances
so
you
must
expect
me
to
form
friendships
with
young
women
at
i
suppose
it
did
occur
to
you
that
those
young
women
who
tend
till
and
serve
the
tables
in
there
are
persons
of
education
and
taste
the
asolando
is
not
a
common
hashery
i
sometimes
fear
that
so
much
crawling
through
chimneys
is
clouding
your
intellect
it
ought
to
have
been
clear
even
to
your
smoky
that
those
girls
in
there
are
not
the
kind
you
can
ask
to
meet
you
by
the
old
mill
at
the
fall
of
dewy
eve
or
who
write
notes
to
popular
romantic
actors
there
not
a
girl
in
that
place
who
has
a
social
position
as
good
as
yours
or
mine
the
asolando
a
kind
of
fad
you
know
ames
it
not
a
tavern
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
where
common
swine
are
fed
for
profit
the
servants
serve
for
love
of
the
cause
it
a
sort
of
cult
but
i
suppose
you
are
incapable
of
grasping
it
there
was
always
something
sordid
in
you
and
i
pained
to
find
that
you
getting
worse
wiggins
had
before
now
occasionally
taken
this
attitude
toward
me
and
it
was
always
with
a
view
to
obscuring
some
real
issue
between
us
he
requires
patience
it
is
a
mistake
to
attempt
to
crowd
him
but
give
him
rope
and
he
will
twist
his
own
halter
we
sparred
further
without
result
i
had
suggested
a
topic
that
had
clearly
some
painful
association
for
my
friend
he
drank
his
coffee
gloomily
and
lighted
a
cigar
much
blacker
than
the
one
i
knew
to
be
his
favorite
in
the
hare
and
tortoise
humidor
he
excused
himself
shortly
and
i
had
a
glimpse
of
him
later
in
the
engaged
upon
letters
a
fact
in
itself
disquieting
for
wiggins
never
wrote
letters
and
it
was
he
who
had
favored
making
the
hare
and
tortoise
into
a
den
for
the
epistolary
habit
he
maintained
was
one
that
should
be
discouraged
i
was
moodily
turning
over
the
evening
newspapers
when
jewett
turned
up
jewett
always
knows
everything
i
shall
not
call
him
a
gossip
but
he
comes
as
near
deserving
the
name
as
a
man
dares
who
lectures
on
the
renaissance
before
clubs
and
jewett
knows
his
botticelli
but
his
knowledge
of
his
contemporaries
is
equally
exact
he
dropped
the
ball
into
the
green
of
my
immediate
interest
with
a
neat
too
bad
about
old
wiggy
he
remarked
with
his
preluding
sigh
what
the
matter
with
wiggins
i
demanded
ah
he
has
told
you
thought
he
told
you
everything
this
was
meant
for
a
stinger
and
i
felt
the
bite
of
it
you
do
me
too
much
honor
wiggins
is
not
a
man
to
throw
around
his
confidences
and
i
rather
fancy
that
his
in
particular
are
locked
in
his
bosom
jewett
was
a
master
of
the
art
of
suggestion
he
took
an
unnecessarily
long
time
to
light
a
cigar
so
that
his
words
might
sink
deep
into
my
consciousness
saw
her
once
last
spring
got
a
sight
draft
from
the
bank
of
eros
followed
her
across
the
multitudinous
sea
bang
but
wiggy
has
been
abroad
wiggy
was
on
his
dakota
ranch
all
summer
he
all
tanned
from
the
sun
just
as
he
is
every
fall
i
persisted
wrote
you
from
out
there
did
he
sent
you
showing
him
herding
his
cattle
or
whatever
the
beasts
are
kept
in
touch
with
you
all
the
time
did
he
i
tell
you
his
fine
color
is
due
to
switzerland
not
dakota
wiggins
is
a
nor
the
sort
of
person
who
wants
to
paper
your
house
with
his
not
writing
does
mean
that
he
was
on
his
ranch
i
replied
annoyed
by
jewett
manner
never
dropped
you
before
though
i
wager
he
chirruped
i
tell
you
he
saw
miss
cecilia
hollister
at
the
asolando
just
a
glimpse
but
almost
immediately
he
went
abroad
in
pursuit
of
her
the
chevalier
that
her
aunt
octavia
was
along
and
another
niece
my
sister
saw
the
bunch
of
them
in
geneva
where
the
chevalier
was
breaking
records
a
whole
troop
of
suitors
followed
them
everywhere
my
sister
knows
the
girl
cecilia
and
she
known
wiggy
all
her
life
she
just
home
and
told
me
about
it
last
night
she
thinks
the
chevalier
has
some
absurd
scheme
for
marrying
off
the
girl
it
all
very
queer
our
wiggy
being
mixed
up
in
it
do
be
absurd
jewett
there
nothing
unusual
in
a
man
being
in
love
that
one
fashion
that
does
change
much
i
venture
to
say
that
wiggins
will
prove
a
formidable
suitor
wiggins
is
a
gentleman
and
the
girl
would
be
lucky
to
get
him
quite
right
my
dear
ames
but
alas
there
are
others
the
competition
is
encouraged
by
the
aunt
the
veteran
chevalier
my
sister
says
the
chevalier
seems
to
favor
the
suit
of
a
nebraska
philosopher
who
rejoices
in
the
melodious
name
of
dick
jewett
was
playing
me
for
all
his
story
was
worth
and
enjoying
himself
immensely
for
heaven
sake
go
on
nice
girl
this
cecilia
you
know
the
hollisters
oodles
of
money
in
the
family
the
chevalier
father
scored
big
in
responsible
for
the
modern
perambulators
sold
out
to
a
trust
the
father
of
wiggins
inamorata
had
started
in
to
be
a
marine
painter
a
founder
of
this
club
come
to
think
of
it
but
dropped
out
long
ago
you
have
heard
of
him
bassford
hollister
funny
thing
his
having
to
give
up
art
great
gifts
for
the
marine
but
never
could
overcome
tendency
to
seasickness
honest
every
time
he
painted
a
wave
it
upset
him
horribly
the
doctors
could
help
him
next
tried
his
hand
at
the
big
gulches
there
was
a
chance
there
to
hit
off
the
metropolitan
and
become
immortal
by
doing
it
first
but
a
new
trouble
developed
doing
the
high
buildings
made
him
dizzy
honest
he
was
good
too
and
would
have
made
a
place
but
he
had
to
cut
it
out
he
was
so
torn
up
over
his
two
failures
that
he
blew
in
his
share
of
the
perambulator
money
in
riotous
living
lost
his
wife
into
the
bargain
and
has
settled
down
to
a
peaceful
life
up
in
westchester
county
in
one
of
these
cute
little
bungalows
the
operators
build
for
you
if
you
pay
a
dollar
down
for
a
picture
of
an
acre
lot
and
the
daughter
well
bassford
hollister
has
two
daughters
it
the
older
one
that
has
stolen
wiggins
heart
away
she
cecilia
you
know
very
literary
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
pushed
tea
and
cookies
at
the
asolando
when
that
idiocy
was
opened
wiggins
saw
her
there
last
spring
miss
hollister
the
aunt
whom
i
fond
of
calling
the
chevalier
picked
up
her
nieces
about
that
time
and
hauled
them
off
to
europe
and
wiggins
scampered
after
them
i
do
know
what
they
did
to
wiggy
but
you
see
how
he
acts
i
rather
imagine
that
the
chevalier
did
smile
on
his
suit
she
a
holy
terror
that
woman
with
an
international
reputation
for
doing
weird
and
most
unaccountable
things
she
draws
a
sort
of
royalty
on
all
the
in
creation
it
amounts
to
a
in
contravention
of
the
free
guarantees
of
the
constitution
the
people
will
rise
against
it
some
day
she
plausible
enough
but
she
the
past
mistress
of
ulterior
motive
she
got
fortner
the
mural
painter
up
to
a
place
she
used
to
have
at
newport
a
few
years
ago
ostensibly
to
do
a
frieze
or
something
and
she
made
him
teach
her
to
fire
a
gun
you
know
fortner
with
his
artistic
ideals
and
he
did
know
any
more
about
guns
than
a
flea
it
was
droll
decidedly
droll
but
she
kept
him
there
a
month
would
let
him
off
the
reservation
but
she
paid
him
his
fee
just
the
same
though
he
never
painted
a
stroke
when
he
got
back
to
town
he
was
a
wreck
it
was
just
like
being
in
jail
i
warn
you
to
let
her
alone
if
you
should
undertake
to
fix
her
flues
she
likely
to
put
you
to
work
digging
potatoes
she
no
end
of
a
case
well
wiggins
is
a
good
fellow
one
of
the
very
best
i
remarked
as
i
absorbed
these
revelations
and
it
is
the
girl
aunt
he
wants
to
marry
he
a
capital
fellow
affirmed
jewett
and
that
why
it
a
sin
this
had
to
happen
to
him
there
no
telling
where
this
affair
may
lead
him
there
something
queer
in
the
wind
all
right
the
chevalier
has
brother
bassford
where
he
ca
whimper
i
rather
fancy
he
feeds
from
her
hand
his
girls
have
any
prospects
except
through
the
chevalier
nice
girls
so
i
told
but
between
the
father
with
his
vertiginous
tendencies
and
a
lunatic
aunt
who
holds
the
family
i
do
see
much
ahead
of
them
miss
cecilia
hollister
is
living
with
her
aunt
it
a
sort
of
compulsory
sequestration
she
has
to
do
it
whether
she
wants
to
or
not
i
rather
fancy
it
to
keep
her
away
from
wiggins
and
the
other
sister
where
does
she
come
in
not
important
i
fancy
rumor
is
silent
touching
her
in
fact
i
never
heard
anything
of
her
but
this
cecilia
is
no
end
handsome
and
proud
poor
old
wiggy
i
was
already
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
encouraged
jewett
to
discuss
wiggins
affairs
and
was
about
to
leave
him
when
he
snorted
in
a
disagreeable
way
he
had
at
some
joke
that
had
occurred
to
him
and
he
continued
chuckling
to
himself
to
attract
my
attention
my
frown
did
not
dismay
him
illustration
he
continued
chuckling
to
himself
to
attract
my
attention
i
knew
there
was
something
he
was
saying
about
miss
younger
sister
and
i
just
recalled
it
the
girl
has
a
most
extraordinary
name
quite
the
most
remarkable
you
ever
heard
he
laughed
until
he
was
purple
in
the
face
i
did
not
imagine
that
any
name
known
to
feminine
nomenclature
could
be
so
humorous
hezekiah
bang
that
the
little
sister
name
bassford
hollister
had
been
saving
that
name
for
a
son
who
never
appeared
to
do
honor
to
old
hezekiah
the
so
they
named
the
girl
for
her
bang
one
of
the
apostles
hezekiah
i
waited
for
his
mirth
to
wear
itself
out
and
then
rose
to
terminate
the
interview
with
an
adequate
dramatic
dismissal
you
poor
pagan
i
remarked
with
such
irony
as
i
could
command
too
bad
you
insist
on
revealing
the
abysmal
depths
of
your
ignorance
hezekiah
was
not
an
apostle
but
a
mighty
king
before
the
day
of
apostles
i
left
him
blinking
and
unconvinced
as
to
hezekiah
proper
place
in
history
wiggins
i
learned
at
the
office
had
within
half
an
hour
left
the
club
hurriedly
in
a
cab
taking
a
trunk
with
him
he
had
mentioned
no
to
the
clerk
and
this
was
very
unlike
wiggins
chapter
ii
the
beginning
of
my
adventure
wiggins
strange
conduct
and
jewett
dark
hints
so
disturbed
me
that
the
very
next
afternoon
i
again
sought
the
asolando
feeling
that
in
its
atmosphere
i
might
best
weigh
the
few
facts
i
possessed
touching
my
friend
those
who
care
for
details
in
these
matters
may
be
interested
to
know
that
the
asolando
is
tucked
away
among
and
exclusive
haberdashers
a
stone
throw
from
fifth
avenue
the
asolando
has
a
history
of
its
own
but
it
is
not
the
office
of
this
chronicler
to
record
it
weightier
matters
are
ahead
of
us
and
it
must
suffice
that
the
asolando
is
sacred
to
wooers
of
the
flute
of
pan
secession
photographers
and
confident
believers
in
an
early
revival
of
the
poetic
drama
one
of
my
friends
who
has
probably
done
more
to
popularize
nietzsche
than
any
other
american
had
frequently
urged
me
to
visit
the
asolando
where
he
declared
the
daintiest
imaginable
luncheons
could
be
obtained
at
nominal
prices
but
i
should
not
have
paid
this
second
visit
had
it
not
been
for
jewett
history
it
was
common
gossip
in
studios
where
i
loafed
between
my
professional
engagements
that
the
monthly
deficit
at
the
asolando
was
cared
for
by
a
retired
banker
whose
weakness
is
as
to
the
truth
of
this
i
have
no
opinion
it
will
suffice
if
i
convey
in
the
fewest
possible
lines
a
suggestion
of
the
tranquillity
the
charming
cloistral
peace
of
the
little
room
with
its
arts
and
crafts
chairs
and
tables
its
racks
of
books
its
portraits
of
browning
rossetti
and
kindred
spirits
nor
should
i
fail
to
mention
the
delightful
inadvertence
with
which
neatly
framed
excerpts
from
the
bright
page
of
british
song
are
scattered
along
the
walls
nowhere
else
many
had
averred
was
one
so
likely
to
learn
of
the
latest
celtic
poet
or
of
a
keats
letter
and
lest
injustice
be
done
in
these
suggestions
to
the
substantial
scholarly
attainments
of
the
habitués
i
must
record
that
it
was
over
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
asolando
that
bennett
made
the
first
notes
for
his
revolutionary
essay
on
the
sapphic
fragments
in
a
text
still
treasured
among
the
memorabilia
i
chose
a
table
sat
down
and
suggested
one
does
not
order
at
the
asolando
a
few
articles
from
the
card
an
attendant
handed
me
we
out
of
the
paracelsus
she
replied
but
i
recommend
a
ruskin
sandwich
with
our
own
special
chocolate
the
whipped
cream
is
unusually
fine
she
eyed
me
with
a
severity
to
which
i
was
not
accustomed
and
i
acquiesced
without
parley
in
her
suggestion
before
leaving
me
she
placed
on
my
table
the
latest
minor
poet
in
green
and
gold
it
was
nearly
three
and
there
were
few
customers
in
the
asolando
at
the
next
table
two
women
were
engaged
in
conversation
in
the
subdued
tones
the
place
compelled
i
surmised
from
the
amount
and
variety
of
their
impedimenta
and
their
abstracted
air
peculiar
to
those
who
partake
of
lobster
salad
with
an
eye
on
the
that
they
were
suburbanites
one
of
them
drew
from
her
net
several
sheets
of
blue
and
began
to
read
by
the
jingle
of
the
rhymes
and
the
flow
of
the
rhythm
it
was
clear
even
to
my
ignorant
lay
mind
that
her
offering
was
a
when
she
had
concluded
her
reading
her
friend
silently
pressed
her
hand
and
after
a
subdued
debate
for
possession
of
the
check
they
took
their
departure
bound
i
surmised
for
some
lesbos
among
the
hills
of
new
jersey
i
was
now
alone
in
the
asolando
the
attending
deities
in
their
snowy
gowns
had
vanished
behind
the
screen
at
the
rear
of
the
room
the
food
and
drink
with
which
i
had
been
promptly
served
proved
excellent
even
the
minor
poet
in
green
and
gold
had
held
my
attention
though
imitations
of
coventry
patmore
odes
bore
me
as
a
rule
near
the
street
behind
a
grill
sat
the
cashier
reading
a
bundle
of
in
a
green
jar
beside
this
young
woman
sent
a
thin
smoke
into
the
air
her
head
was
bent
above
her
book
in
quiet
attention
the
light
from
an
electric
lamp
made
a
glow
of
her
golden
hair
she
was
an
incident
of
the
general
picture
a
part
of
a
scene
that
contained
no
jarring
note
a
man
who
could
devise
in
the
heart
of
the
great
city
a
place
so
instinct
with
repose
so
lulling
to
all
the
senses
was
not
less
than
a
public
benefactor
and
i
resolved
on
the
spot
to
purchase
and
read
at
any
sacrifice
the
of
the
reputed
angel
of
the
asolando
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
adventure
for
it
shall
have
no
meaner
name
actually
began
my
eyes
were
still
enjoying
the
vision
in
the
cashier
tiny
booth
when
a
figure
suddenly
darkened
the
street
door
just
beyond
her
the
girl
lifted
her
head
on
the
instant
the
clicked
as
she
extinguished
her
light
and
the
aureoled
head
ceased
to
be
and
coming
toward
me
down
the
shop
i
beheld
a
lady
a
lady
of
years
who
passed
the
cashier
desk
with
her
eyes
intent
upon
the
room
inner
recesses
her
gown
of
a
new
fashionable
gray
was
of
the
severest
tailor
cut
her
hat
was
a
modified
fedora
gray
like
the
gown
and
adorned
with
a
single
gray
feather
she
was
short
slight
erect
and
moved
with
a
quick
motion
pausing
and
glancing
at
the
vacant
tables
that
lay
between
me
and
the
door
her
air
of
abstraction
became
her
and
she
merged
pleasantly
into
the
of
the
room
as
her
glance
ranged
the
wall
i
thought
that
she
searched
for
some
favorite
flower
of
song
among
the
framed
quotations
but
i
saw
now
that
her
gaze
was
bent
too
low
for
this
she
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
a
calculation
of
some
sort
and
she
raised
a
lorgnette
to
assist
her
in
counting
the
tables
the
cashier
passed
behind
her
unseen
and
vanished
i
heard
the
newcomer
reciting
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
and
at
seven
her
eyes
rested
upon
me
with
a
look
that
mingled
surprise
and
annoyance
she
took
a
step
toward
me
and
i
started
to
rise
but
she
said
quickly
i
beg
your
pardon
but
this
seems
to
be
the
seventh
table
illustration
i
beg
your
pardon
but
this
seems
to
be
the
seventh
table
now
that
you
call
my
attention
to
it
i
remarked
gaining
my
feet
i
am
bound
to
concede
the
point
if
by
any
chance
i
am
intruding
not
in
the
least
on
the
other
hand
i
beg
that
you
remain
where
you
are
and
without
further
ado
she
sank
into
a
chair
opposite
my
own
i
tinkled
a
tiny
crystal
bell
that
was
among
the
and
a
waitress
appeared
and
handed
the
lady
who
had
thus
introduced
herself
to
my
acquaintance
a
copy
of
the
tiny
card
on
which
the
articles
of
refreshment
offered
by
the
asolando
were
indicated
within
a
border
of
field
daisies
never
mind
that
said
the
lady
in
gray
ignoring
the
card
you
may
bring
me
a
caviare
sandwich
and
a
cocktail
a
pink
one
providing
providing
and
she
held
the
waitress
with
her
eye
you
have
the
imported
caviare
and
your
knows
the
proper
frappé
of
the
i
have
named
pardon
me
madam
replied
the
waitress
icily
but
you
have
mistaken
the
place
the
asolando
serves
nothing
stronger
than
the
pure
water
of
its
own
fount
of
castalia
intoxicants
are
not
permitted
here
intoxicants
repeated
the
old
lady
with
asperity
do
i
look
like
a
person
given
to
intoxication
i
dare
say
your
castalia
water
is
nothing
but
croton
whose
flavor
has
been
destroyed
by
distillation
you
may
bring
me
the
sandwich
i
have
mentioned
and
with
it
a
pot
of
tea
yes
thank
you
lemon
with
the
tea
as
the
girl
vanished
with
the
light
tread
that
marked
the
service
of
the
place
i
again
made
as
to
rise
but
the
old
lady
lifted
her
hand
with
a
delaying
gesture
pray
remain
it
is
not
unlikely
that
we
have
friends
and
ideas
in
common
and
as
you
were
seated
at
the
seventh
table
it
is
possible
that
some
ordering
of
fate
has
brought
us
together
she
took
from
me
in
the
hand
which
she
had
now
ungloved
the
copy
of
my
minor
poet
glanced
at
it
scornfully
and
tossed
it
upon
the
floor
with
every
mark
of
disdain
what
species
of
mental
disorder
does
this
place
represent
she
demanded
it
is
sacred
to
the
fine
arts
apparently
an
endowed
where
persons
of
artistic
ideals
may
come
to
refresh
body
and
soul
such
at
least
seems
to
be
the
programme
this
is
only
my
second
visit
but
i
have
long
heard
it
spoken
of
by
artists
poets
and
others
of
my
friends
i
am
years
old
young
man
and
i
beg
to
inform
you
that
i
consider
the
asolando
the
most
preposterous
thing
i
have
ever
heard
of
in
this
most
preposterous
city
and
from
a
casual
glimpse
of
you
i
feel
justified
in
saying
that
a
man
in
your
apparent
physical
health
might
be
in
better
business
than
frequenting
in
a
shop
that
seems
to
be
a
remarkably
stupid
expression
of
anæmia
attendance
here
is
not
compulsory
i
remarked
defensively
if
you
imply
that
i
must
have
sought
the
place
voluntarily
let
me
correct
your
false
impression
immediately
i
dropped
in
here
for
the
excellent
reason
that
this
shop
is
the
seventh
in
numerical
progression
from
fifth
avenue
you
were
not
guided
by
any
feeling
of
interest
then
but
rather
by
superstition
that
remark
is
unworthy
of
a
man
of
your
apparent
intelligence
i
was
born
on
the
seventh
of
november
and
all
the
great
events
of
my
life
have
occurred
on
the
seventh
of
the
month
if
you
were
to
suggest
that
i
am
of
an
adventurous
or
romantic
nature
i
should
readily
acquiesce
but
the
sevens
in
my
life
have
been
so
potent
an
influence
in
all
my
affairs
that
my
belief
in
that
numeral
has
become
almost
a
religious
faith
and
if
you
have
been
a
reader
of
scripture
you
will
understand
that
one
does
not
become
a
pagan
in
ascribing
to
seven
all
manner
of
subtle
influences
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
she
accepted
the
tea
and
sandwiches
the
waitress
had
brought
without
parley
it
is
with
shame
i
confess
that
in
the
first
moments
of
my
encounter
i
believed
her
capable
of
quarreling
with
a
waitress
but
she
thanked
the
girl
pleasantly
lifting
her
head
with
a
smile
that
illumined
her
face
attractively
her
demand
for
a
cocktail
had
not
been
wholly
convincing
as
to
her
sincerity
and
i
wondered
whether
she
were
not
playing
a
part
of
some
kind
she
suggested
pleasant
and
wholesome
things
tiny
gardens
with
neat
borders
of
box
and
beds
of
spicy
pinks
before
the
day
of
carnations
and
the
verbenas
heliotrope
and
honeysuckle
we
associate
with
our
grandmothers
taste
in
floriculture
or
perhaps
i
strike
nearer
the
gold
with
an
intimation
of
a
sunny
banked
neatly
and
not
too
abundantly
in
geraniums
in
any
event
the
impression
was
wholly
agreeable
i
had
to
do
with
a
lady
and
a
lady
of
no
mean
degree
the
marks
of
breeding
were
upon
her
and
she
spoke
with
that
quiet
authority
that
is
the
despair
of
the
vain
and
vulgar
her
features
were
small
and
delicate
her
ringless
hands
were
perfectly
formed
and
both
face
and
hands
belied
the
age
to
which
she
had
so
frankly
confessed
she
was
more
than
twice
my
age
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
reason
why
she
should
not
address
me
if
it
pleased
her
to
do
so
and
her
obsession
as
to
the
potency
of
the
numeral
seven
was
not
in
itself
proof
of
an
mind
i
recalled
that
my
own
mother
had
throughout
her
life
imputed
all
manner
of
occult
powers
and
influences
to
the
number
thirteen
and
i
have
myself
always
been
averse
to
walking
beneath
a
ladder
musing
thus
i
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
encounter
was
very
likely
the
sort
of
thing
that
happened
to
patrons
of
the
asolando
my
time
has
however
a
certain
value
and
i
began
to
wonder
just
how
i
should
escape
i
was
about
to
excuse
myself
when
my
companion
suddenly
put
down
her
cup
and
addressed
me
with
a
directness
that
seemed
habitual
in
her
i
have
formed
an
excellent
opinion
of
your
bringing
up
from
the
manner
in
which
you
have
suffered
my
advances
if
i
may
so
call
them
you
act
and
speak
like
a
gentleman
of
education
i
imagine
from
your
being
in
this
strange
place
that
you
may
be
a
or
a
designer
of
though
i
trust
for
your
own
sake
that
i
am
mistaken
or
it
may
be
that
you
are
a
magazine
poet
though
when
i
tell
you
that
i
read
no
poets
but
isaiah
and
walt
whitman
you
will
understand
that
mere
verse
does
not
attract
me
all
this
and
she
indicated
the
mottoes
on
the
wall
with
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
is
the
sheerest
rubbish
a
form
of
disease
will
you
kindly
tell
me
the
nature
of
your
occupation
i
produced
one
of
my
professional
cards
arnold
ames
consultant
in
chimneys
suite
landon
building
she
read
it
aloud
without
glasses
and
mused
a
moment
this
is
very
curious
she
remarked
placing
my
card
in
a
silver
case
she
drew
from
her
pocket
this
is
very
curious
indeed
it
was
only
yesterday
that
my
friend
general
glendenning
was
speaking
of
you
he
told
me
that
you
had
rendered
him
the
greatest
service
in
adjusting
several
flues
in
his
country
house
at
shinnecock
my
own
fireplaces
doubtless
require
attention
and
you
may
consider
yourself
retained
i
shall
make
an
early
appointment
with
you
you
will
find
my
name
and
residence
sufficiently
described
on
this
card
hopefield
manor
oh
i
exclaimed
bowing
any
further
introduction
is
unnecessary
miss
hollister
the
name
is
familiar
i
recall
that
general
glendenning
mentioned
that
you
were
related
to
the
ames
family
of
hartford
and
your
mother
was
a
farquhar
of
charlottesville
virginia
if
you
bear
your
name
i
dare
say
it
was
he
whom
i
met
ten
years
ago
in
paris
there
is
no
reason
therefore
why
we
should
not
be
the
best
of
friends
she
continued
to
talk
as
she
drew
on
her
gloves
and
i
saw
as
her
eyes
rested
on
mine
from
time
to
time
during
this
process
that
they
were
the
most
kindly
and
humorous
eyes
in
the
world
her
face
was
scarcely
wrinkled
but
the
hair
that
showed
under
the
small
plain
hat
was
evenly
and
beautifully
gray
it
was
a
kind
fate
indeed
that
had
led
me
back
to
the
asolando
and
introduced
me
to
the
aunt
of
wiggins
inamorata
it
may
well
be
believed
that
i
was
immediately
interested
attentive
absorbed
as
she
smoothed
her
gloves
miss
hollister
continued
to
speak
in
a
low
musical
voice
that
was
devoid
of
any
of
the
quavers
of
age
on
the
day
i
reached
my
sixtieth
year
ames
i
decided
that
my
humdrum
life
must
cease
the
strictest
conventions
had
guided
me
from
earliest
childhood
my
experience
of
life
had
been
limited
to
those
things
which
women
of
education
and
means
enjoy
or
suffer
as
you
please
to
take
it
i
resolved
that
for
the
years
that
remained
to
me
i
should
seek
to
enjoy
myself
after
my
own
fashion
to
sit
in
the
inglenook
and
knit
with
no
human
companionship
but
sick
kittens
with
dull
monotony
broken
only
by
visits
from
dutiful
clergymen
in
pursuit
of
alms
for
foreign
missions
was
not
for
me
two
years
ago
i
chartered
a
yacht
and
cruised
among
the
lesser
antilles
enjoying
many
adventures
later
i
crossed
the
andes
and
i
have
just
returned
from
switzerland
where
i
accomplished
some
of
the
most
difficult
ascents
i
have
a
clipping
bureau
engaged
to
inform
me
of
all
rumors
of
hidden
treasure
and
sunken
ships
and
i
hope
that
of
this
something
may
come
as
i
retain
a
marine
engineer
and
corps
of
divers
and
can
leave
at
an
hour
notice
for
any
likely
this
may
strike
you
as
the
most
whimsical
tell
me
candidly
whether
my
remarks
so
affect
you
if
it
were
not
that
your
benefactions
of
all
kinds
have
given
you
noble
eminence
among
american
philanthropists
i
might
be
less
biased
in
favor
of
the
sort
of
thing
you
describe
but
your
gifts
to
orphanages
colleges
hospitals
ah
she
interrupted
enough
of
that
philanthropy
in
these
times
is
only
selfish
exploitation
the
recreation
of
the
but
you
see
no
reason
why
she
pursued
eagerly
if
i
wished
to
dig
up
the
caribbean
sea
in
search
of
spanish
doubloons
i
should
not
do
so
answer
me
frankly
without
the
slightest
fear
i
assure
you
miss
hollister
that
such
projects
appeal
to
me
strongly
i
have
often
lamented
that
my
own
lot
fell
in
these
eventless
times
as
an
architect
i
proved
something
of
a
failure
as
a
i
lead
a
useful
life
but
the
very
usefulness
of
it
bores
me
and
besides
many
people
take
me
for
a
sweep
i
dare
say
they
do
for
unfortunately
many
people
are
fools
but
i
am
bent
upon
adventure
it
has
dawned
upon
me
that
every
day
has
its
possibilities
that
the
right
turn
at
any
corner
may
bring
me
face
to
face
with
the
most
stirring
encounters
my
age
protects
me
where
youth
must
timidly
turn
back
my
physician
pronounces
me
good
for
ten
years
more
of
active
life
and
i
intend
to
keep
amused
if
i
were
a
young
man
like
you
i
should
crawl
through
chimneys
no
more
but
take
to
the
open
road
i
resent
the
harsh
clang
of
these
meaningless
years
as
i
walked
among
the
hills
that
lie
behind
the
manor
this
morning
i
heard
the
bugles
calling
out
there
in
the
avenue
at
this
hour
there
are
miles
of
fat
dowagers
in
padded
broughams
who
think
of
nothing
but
clothes
and
food
and
speaking
of
food
she
continued
with
a
droll
turn
i
am
convinced
that
the
caviare
in
that
sandwich
was
never
nearer
russia
than
casco
bay
she
drew
out
her
watch
and
noting
the
hour
concluded
clearly
we
have
much
in
common
i
should
like
to
ask
you
further
as
to
your
unusual
profession
but
errands
summon
me
elsewhere
however
something
tells
me
we
shall
meet
again
she
rose
in
her
swift
fashion
and
passed
lightly
down
the
room
and
through
the
door
she
had
left
a
dollar
beside
her
plate
to
pay
her
check
which
i
noted
called
for
only
forty
cents
i
glanced
at
the
cashier
desk
the
aureoled
head
had
not
reappeared
but
immediately
i
heard
a
voice
murmuring
beside
me
i
had
believed
myself
alone
and
in
my
surprise
i
thought
some
wizardry
had
made
audible
one
of
the
verses
on
the
wall
what
of
rafael
sonnets
dante
picture
it
was
she
whose
aureoled
head
i
had
marked
earlier
in
the
receipt
of
custom
the
girl
who
had
vanished
as
miss
hollister
appeared
she
wore
the
snowy
vestments
of
the
other
attending
vestals
with
the
difference
that
the
cap
that
crowned
the
waitresses
was
omitted
in
her
case
this
i
took
to
be
the
asolando
tribute
to
her
adorable
head
which
clearly
did
not
need
the
electric
light
or
other
adventitious
aid
to
invoke
its
lovely
glow
the
line
she
had
spoken
hung
goldenly
upon
the
air
she
was
not
tall
and
her
eyes
i
saw
were
brown
she
had
clearly
not
climbed
far
the
stairway
of
her
years
but
her
serenity
was
the
least
bit
disconcerting
pardon
me
i
began
but
i
am
an
ignorant
philistine
and
can
not
cap
the
verse
you
have
quoted
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
do
so
it
is
the
rule
of
the
asolando
that
we
shall
attract
the
attention
of
customers
when
necessary
by
speaking
a
line
of
verse
we
are
not
allowed
to
open
a
conversation
no
matter
how
imperative
with
or
the
even
more
vulgar
a
capital
idea
of
which
i
heartily
approve
but
now
that
i
am
a
waiting
auditor
eager
it
merely
the
check
if
you
please
she
interrupted
coldly
my
desk
is
closed
and
the
room
will
refuse
further
patrons
for
the
next
hour
as
the
executive
committee
of
the
shelley
society
meets
here
at
four
and
the
asolando
is
denied
to
outsiders
this
then
is
my
dismissal
the
lady
who
joined
me
here
for
a
time
left
a
dollar
which
you
will
see
is
somewhat
in
excess
of
her
check
my
own
charge
of
fifty
cents
is
so
moderate
that
i
can
not
do
less
than
leave
a
dollar
also
thank
you
she
replied
unshaken
by
my
generosity
the
tips
at
the
asolando
all
go
to
the
sweetness
and
light
club
which
is
just
now
engaged
in
circulating
matthew
arnold
poems
in
leaflet
form
in
the
jobbing
district
i
sympathize
with
that
propaganda
i
replied
gathering
up
my
hat
and
stick
and
am
delighted
to
contribute
to
its
support
and
now
i
dare
say
you
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
the
asolando
has
tolerated
me
longer
than
my
slight
purchases
justified
i
bowed
and
had
turned
away
when
she
arrested
me
with
the
line
my
good
blade
carves
the
casques
of
men
i
turned
toward
her
several
of
the
waitresses
were
now
engaged
in
rearranging
the
tables
but
they
seemed
not
to
heed
us
permit
me
to
inquire
she
asked
whether
the
lady
who
joined
you
here
expressed
any
interest
in
the
life
beautiful
as
it
is
exemplified
in
the
asolando
i
am
constrained
to
say
that
she
did
not
she
spoke
of
the
asolando
in
the
most
contumelious
terms
the
golden
head
bowed
slightly
and
a
smile
hovered
about
her
lips
but
her
amusement
at
my
answer
was
more
eloquently
stated
in
her
eyes
i
must
explain
that
my
sole
excuse
for
addressing
you
is
that
we
are
required
to
learn
where
possible
just
why
strangers
seek
the
asolando
in
the
case
of
the
lady
to
whom
you
refer
it
was
a
matter
of
this
being
the
seventh
shop
from
the
corner
and
my
own
appearance
was
due
to
the
idlest
curiosity
inspired
by
enthusiastic
descriptions
of
the
asolando
atmosphere
and
rumors
of
the
cheapness
of
its
food
the
reasons
are
quite
ample
was
her
only
comment
and
her
manner
did
not
encourage
further
conversation
may
i
ask
i
persisted
whether
the
asolando
staff
is
permanent
and
whether
if
i
return
another
day
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
so
i
will
answer
that
my
service
here
is
limited
to
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
on
the
other
days
pippa
is
in
the
my
name
at
the
asolando
is
francesca
i
had
guessed
it
might
be
lalage
or
chloris
i
ventured
she
shook
her
head
gravely
kindly
write
your
name
in
the
visitors
book
at
the
door
as
you
pass
out
there
was
no
ignoring
this
hint
i
thought
she
smiled
as
i
left
her
iii
i
fall
into
a
briar
patch
miss
hollister
summons
lay
on
my
desk
the
next
morning
and
was
of
the
briefest
i
was
requested
to
call
at
hopefield
manor
at
four
the
following
afternoon
being
thursday
a
trap
would
meet
me
at
katonah
and
it
was
suggested
that
i
come
prepared
to
spend
the
night
so
that
the
condition
of
the
flues
might
be
discussed
and
any
necessary
changes
planned
during
the
evening
the
note
signed
octavia
hollister
was
written
in
a
flowing
hand
on
a
wholly
impeccable
note
sheet
stamped
hopefield
manor
katonah
before
taking
the
train
i
sought
wiggins
by
telephone
at
his
office
and
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
where
he
lodged
but
without
learning
anything
as
to
his
whereabouts
his
office
did
not
answer
but
wiggins
office
had
never
been
responsive
to
the
telephone
so
this
was
not
significant
the
more
i
considered
his
conduct
during
the
recital
of
my
visit
to
the
asolando
the
more
i
wondered
and
in
spite
of
my
wish
to
ignore
utterly
jewett
revelations
as
to
summer
abroad
i
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
jewett
had
not
lied
i
had
known
wiggins
long
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
been
conscious
of
any
withholding
of
confidence
on
his
part
and
on
my
own
i
had
not
merely
confided
all
my
hopes
and
aims
to
him
but
i
had
leaned
upon
him
often
in
my
perplexities
there
was
indeed
a
kind
of
boyish
compact
between
us
that
we
should
support
each
other
through
all
difficulties
this
as
i
remembered
dated
back
to
our
prep
and
had
been
reinforced
by
a
fearsome
oath
inspired
doubtless
by
some
dark
fiction
that
had
captivated
our
youthful
imaginations
his
failure
to
tell
me
of
his
summer
abroad
or
of
his
interest
in
the
hollisters
when
i
had
afforded
him
so
excellent
an
opening
by
my
reference
to
the
asolando
emphasized
the
seriousness
of
his
plight
his
reserve
hid
i
knew
a
diffident
and
sensitive
nature
and
it
was
wholly
possible
that
if
his
affair
with
cecilia
hollister
had
not
prospered
he
had
fled
to
his
ranch
there
to
wrestle
in
seclusion
with
his
disappointment
my
mind
was
busy
with
such
speculations
as
i
sped
toward
katonah
where
i
found
the
trap
from
hopefield
manor
awaiting
me
it
rather
poor
going
over
the
hills
about
five
miles
sir
said
the
driver
as
we
set
off
this
sort
of
thing
was
wholly
usual
in
the
nature
of
my
vocation
the
flues
in
country
houses
seem
much
more
willful
and
obdurate
than
those
in
town
a
fact
which
i
have
frequently
discussed
with
architects
and
i
had
been
met
in
just
this
way
at
many
stations
within
a
radius
of
fifty
miles
of
new
york
and
carried
to
houses
whose
chimneys
were
provocative
of
wrath
and
indignation
in
their
owners
this
was
the
first
week
in
october
there
was
just
zest
enough
in
the
air
to
make
a
top
coat
comfortable
the
team
of
blacks
spoke
well
for
miss
hollister
stable
and
the
liveried
driver
kept
them
moving
steadily
but
eased
the
pace
as
we
rose
on
the
frequent
slopes
to
the
shoulders
of
pleasant
hills
the
immediate
neighborhood
into
which
we
were
wending
was
unknown
to
me
though
i
saw
familiar
landmarks
i
am
not
one
to
quibble
over
the
efforts
of
man
to
supplement
the
work
of
nature
so
that
i
confess
without
shame
that
the
croton
lakes
to
my
cockney
eye
merge
flawlessly
into
this
landscape
it
is
not
for
me
to
raise
the
cry
of
utilitarianism
against
these
saucerfuls
of
blue
water
merely
because
the
fluid
thus
caught
and
held
bubbles
and
sparkles
later
in
the
taps
of
the
manhattaners
early
frosts
had
already
wrought
their
miracle
in
the
foliage
and
the
of
winter
vanguard
flashed
along
the
horizons
i
rejoiced
that
my
business
vexatious
enough
in
many
ways
yet
afforded
me
so
charming
an
outing
as
this
presently
we
climbed
a
hill
that
shouldered
its
way
well
above
its
fellows
and
came
out
upon
a
broad
ridge
where
we
entered
at
once
a
noble
gateway
set
in
an
old
stone
wall
and
struck
off
smartly
along
a
fine
bit
of
macadam
the
house
the
driver
informed
me
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
gate
the
way
led
through
a
wild
woodland
in
which
elms
and
maples
predominated
and
before
this
had
grown
monotonous
we
came
abruptly
upon
an
italian
garden
beyond
which
rose
the
house
i
knew
it
at
once
for
one
of
pepperton
sound
performances
pepperton
is
easily
our
best
man
in
domestic
tudor
and
the
whole
setting
of
hopefield
manor
the
sunken
garden
the
superb
view
the
billowing
fields
and
woodlands
beyond
all
testified
to
a
taste
which
no
ignorant
owner
had
thwarted
the
house
was
tudor
but
in
no
servile
sense
it
was
also
pepperton
i
lifted
my
eyes
with
immediate
professional
interest
to
the
on
the
roof
it
occurred
to
me
on
the
instant
that
i
had
never
before
been
called
to
retouch
any
of
pepperton
work
pep
knew
as
much
as
i
about
i
had
an
immense
respect
for
pep
and
as
my
specializing
in
chimneys
had
been
a
subject
of
frequent
chaffing
between
us
i
anticipated
with
a
chuckle
the
pleasure
i
should
have
later
in
telling
him
that
at
last
one
of
his
flues
had
required
my
services
my
good
opinion
of
miss
hollister
did
not
diminish
as
i
stepped
within
the
broad
hall
houses
have
their
own
manner
of
speech
and
hopefield
manor
spoke
to
all
the
senses
in
accents
of
taste
and
refinement
a
servant
took
my
bag
and
ushered
me
into
a
charming
library
a
fire
smouldered
lazily
in
the
great
fireplace
there
was
in
the
room
the
faintest
scent
of
burnt
wood
but
the
smoke
rose
in
the
flue
in
a
perfectly
mannerly
fashion
and
on
thrusting
in
my
hand
i
felt
a
good
draught
of
air
i
instinctively
knelt
on
the
hearth
and
peered
up
but
saw
nothing
unworkmanlike
pepperton
was
not
a
fellow
to
leave
obvious
mistakes
behind
him
but
possibly
this
was
not
one
of
the
recalcitrant
fireplaces
i
had
been
called
to
inspect
and
i
rose
and
was
continuing
my
enjoyment
of
the
beautiful
room
when
i
became
conscious
by
rather
curious
and
mixed
processes
not
wholly
of
the
eye
that
a
young
woman
had
drawn
back
the
light
portieres
they
were
dark
brown
with
borders
of
burnt
orange
and
stood
gravely
gazing
at
me
she
held
the
curtains
apart
they
made
indeed
a
kind
of
frame
for
her
but
as
our
eyes
met
she
advanced
at
once
and
spoke
my
name
illustration
she
held
the
curtains
apart
you
are
ames
my
aunt
expected
you
i
regret
to
say
that
she
is
not
in
the
house
just
now
but
she
will
doubtless
return
for
tea
i
am
her
niece
wo
you
sit
down
as
she
found
a
seat
for
herself
i
made
bold
to
survey
her
with
some
particularity
she
carried
her
fine
height
with
beautiful
dignity
she
was
a
creature
of
grace
and
it
was
a
grace
of
strength
the
suppleness
and
ease
that
mark
our
later
outdoor
american
woman
she
could
do
her
miles
over
these
hills
i
was
sure
of
that
her
fine
olive
face
crowned
with
dark
hair
verified
the
impression
i
had
gathered
from
jewett
that
she
was
a
woman
of
cultivation
she
had
read
the
poets
dante
and
petrarch
spoke
from
her
eyes
cecilia
was
no
bad
name
for
her
she
suggested
heavenly
harmonies
and
as
for
jewett
story
of
wiggins
infatuation
i
was
content
if
this
was
the
face
that
had
shattered
the
frowning
towers
of
wiggins
ilium
and
sent
him
to
brood
disconsolate
upon
his
broad
acres
in
dakota
my
heart
went
out
to
him
for
his
armor
had
been
pierced
by
arrows
worthy
of
its
metal
she
was
talking
meanwhile
of
the
day
and
its
buoyant
air
and
of
the
tapestries
hung
in
the
woodlands
in
a
voice
deep
with
rare
intimations
of
viol
chords
it
very
quiet
here
it
does
seem
possible
that
we
are
so
near
the
city
my
aunt
chose
the
place
with
care
and
she
made
no
mistake
about
it
yes
the
house
was
built
by
pepperton
but
not
for
us
my
aunt
bought
it
of
the
estate
of
the
gentleman
who
built
it
this
will
be
her
first
winter
here
she
made
no
reference
to
the
object
of
my
visit
and
i
wondered
if
she
knew
just
how
i
came
there
a
wheeled
in
a
portable
and
placed
it
beside
a
particular
chair
lighted
the
lamp
under
the
kettle
and
silently
departed
and
with
the
stage
thus
disposed
miss
hollister
herself
appeared
she
greeted
me
without
surprise
and
much
as
she
might
have
spoken
to
any
guest
in
her
house
i
had
sometimes
been
treated
as
though
i
were
the
agent
of
a
decorator
shop
or
a
delinquent
plumber
by
the
people
whom
i
served
but
miss
hollister
and
her
niece
established
me
upon
a
plane
that
was
wholly
social
i
was
made
to
feel
that
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
me
to
be
there
having
tea
with
no
business
ahead
of
me
but
to
be
agreeable
the
fact
that
i
had
come
to
correct
the
distemper
of
their
flues
was
utterly
negligible
i
remembered
with
satisfaction
that
i
had
journeyed
from
town
in
a
new
business
suit
that
made
the
best
of
my
attenuated
figure
and
i
will
not
deny
that
i
felt
at
ease
miss
hollister
talked
briskly
as
she
made
the
tea
i
was
over
at
the
kennels
when
you
came
i
believe
the
is
a
rascal
cecilia
i
have
no
opinion
of
him
whatever
he
was
highly
recommended
replied
the
niece
it
not
his
fault
that
the
fox
terriers
were
sick
i
dare
say
it
is
said
the
old
lady
measuring
the
tea
but
his
fault
that
he
whipped
one
of
those
cuban
hounds
i
sure
he
whipped
her
the
poor
beast
was
afraid
to
crawl
out
when
i
called
her
this
afternoon
we
were
warned
against
those
dogs
aunt
octavia
but
i
must
admit
that
they
have
lovely
eyes
miss
cecilia
manner
toward
her
aunt
left
nothing
to
be
desired
it
was
wholly
deferential
and
kind
and
her
dignity
i
surmised
was
equal
to
any
emergency
that
might
rise
between
them
do
you
ever
shoot
behind
traps
demanded
miss
hollister
abruptly
the
question
surprised
me
i
did
not
shoot
behind
traps
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
but
it
delighted
me
to
find
that
her
unusual
interests
as
she
had
touched
upon
them
at
the
asolando
were
part
of
a
consistent
scheme
of
life
she
talked
of
her
experiments
with
different
guns
and
traps
her
arms
folded
her
eyes
reverting
occasionally
to
the
kettle
it
was
all
in
the
shells
she
said
before
she
had
begun
filling
her
own
cartridges
she
had
no
end
of
trouble
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
take
tea
if
you
do
care
for
it
ames
she
said
as
i
rose
and
handed
the
first
cup
to
cecilia
if
you
will
touch
the
bell
at
your
elbow
you
may
have
liquids
of
quite
another
sort
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
this
temperance
wave
that
is
sweeping
the
country
does
not
interest
me
in
the
least
our
great
americans
of
the
old
times
were
gentlemen
who
took
their
liquor
with
no
cowardly
fear
of
public
censure
you
will
find
my
sideboard
well
stocked
after
the
fashion
of
old
times
and
i
have
with
my
own
hand
placed
in
your
room
a
quart
of
scotch
given
me
at
the
distillery
four
years
ago
by
its
proprietor
lord
mertondale
a
case
of
like
quality
is
yours
at
any
moment
you
choose
to
press
the
button
at
the
head
of
your
bed
you
are
most
generous
miss
hollister
tea
will
suffice
for
the
moment
it
is
fitting
that
i
should
take
it
here
it
having
been
a
weakness
for
tea
as
well
as
curiosity
and
chance
that
threw
me
in
your
way
at
the
asolando
that
absurd
that
preposterous
hole
in
the
wall
she
put
down
her
cup
and
faced
me
continuing
ames
i
will
not
deny
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
general
glendenning
cordial
indorsement
of
you
and
the
further
fact
that
i
had
met
your
late
father
i
should
not
have
invited
you
to
my
house
on
the
occasion
to
which
you
refer
my
contempt
for
the
asolando
and
the
things
it
stands
for
is
beyond
such
language
as
a
lady
may
use
before
the
young
i
laughed
at
her
earnestness
but
on
turning
toward
miss
cecilia
i
saw
that
she
was
placidly
stirring
her
cup
it
might
be
that
one
was
not
expected
to
manifest
amusement
in
miss
hollister
utterances
and
i
was
anxious
to
adjust
myself
to
the
proper
key
in
my
intercourse
no
matter
how
brief
it
might
be
with
this
remarkable
old
lady
in
my
embarrassment
i
rose
and
offered
the
bread
and
butter
to
cecilia
who
declined
it
the
austerity
of
her
rejection
rather
unnerved
me
to
think
that
with
all
the
opportunities
for
adventure
that
offer
in
this
day
and
generation
any
one
should
waste
time
on
the
idiotic
worship
of
a
lot
of
silly
moulders
of
literary
patisserie
it
is
beyond
me
ames
and
when
i
recall
that
your
late
father
commanded
a
cavalry
regiment
in
the
civil
war
i
fall
back
upon
the
privilege
of
my
age
to
beg
that
you
will
hereafter
give
the
asolando
a
wide
berth
i
assure
you
miss
hollister
that
i
have
no
wish
to
become
an
habitué
of
the
place
and
yet
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
repeat
that
but
for
it
i
should
not
now
be
enjoying
the
hospitality
of
hopefield
manor
she
lifted
her
head
from
her
cup
and
bowed
but
i
was
immediately
interested
in
the
fact
that
her
niece
was
speaking
i
think
aunt
octavia
is
hard
on
the
asolando
she
was
saying
aunt
octavia
is
interested
in
the
revival
of
romance
and
romance
without
poetry
seems
to
me
wholly
impossible
the
asolando
makes
no
pretensions
to
be
more
than
an
incident
in
a
real
movement
whose
aim
is
the
diffusion
of
poetic
fire
it
is
merely
a
shrine
where
the
divine
lamp
is
never
allowed
to
fail
or
falter
and
if
cecilia
hollister
you
think
that
sandwiches
named
for
browning
poems
or
macaroons
dedicated
to
walter
pater
can
assist
foolish
virgins
in
keeping
their
lamps
filled
i
give
you
the
word
of
an
old
woman
that
you
are
in
danger
of
a
complete
loss
of
your
mind
the
age
is
decadent
and
i
know
no
better
way
of
restoring
the
race
to
its
ancient
vim
and
energy
than
by
sending
men
back
to
the
camp
and
field
or
to
sail
the
high
seas
in
new
armadas
the
men
of
this
age
have
become
a
lot
of
sordid
shopkeepers
and
to
my
moral
sense
the
looting
of
cities
is
far
more
honorable
than
the
creation
of
trusts
and
the
manipulation
of
prices
though
i
can
not
deny
that
but
for
my
late
father
zeal
in
destroying
his
competitors
in
the
business
we
might
not
now
be
enjoying
the
delicate
fragrance
of
caravan
tea
i
continued
to
flounder
in
my
anxiety
to
determine
just
how
miss
hollister
wished
to
be
taken
she
spoke
with
the
utmost
seriousness
and
with
the
earnestness
of
deep
conviction
if
the
aims
of
the
asolando
were
absurd
what
might
be
said
of
the
declarations
of
this
old
lady
in
favor
of
a
return
to
the
age
of
sword
and
buckler
i
again
turned
to
cecilia
thinking
that
i
should
find
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
that
might
solve
the
riddle
and
make
easier
my
responses
to
her
aunt
appeals
her
reply
did
not
help
me
greatly
i
assure
you
ames
that
the
asolando
is
a
very
harmless
place
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
aims
are
wholly
consonant
with
those
of
aunt
octavia
i
myself
served
there
for
a
time
and
those
were
among
the
most
delightful
days
of
my
life
and
you
might
still
be
handing
about
the
rossetti
éclairs
in
that
smothery
little
place
if
i
had
not
rescued
you
from
your
bondage
i
assure
you
ames
that
my
niece
is
a
perfectly
healthy
young
woman
to
whom
all
such
rubbish
is
really
abhorrent
i
expected
miss
cecilia
to
rouse
at
this
but
she
ignored
her
fling
saying
merely
there
are
times
when
i
miss
the
asolando
ames
began
miss
octavia
presently
in
her
crisp
direct
fashion
which
had
the
effect
of
leading
me
in
my
anxiety
to
appear
ready
with
answers
to
take
a
flattering
view
of
my
own
courage
and
resourcefulness
ames
are
you
equal
to
the
feat
of
swimming
a
moat
under
a
shattering
fire
from
the
castle
i
have
every
reason
to
think
i
am
miss
hollister
i
replied
modestly
and
if
a
white
hand
waved
to
you
from
the
grilled
window
of
the
lonely
tower
would
you
ride
on
indifferently
or
pause
and
thunder
at
the
gate
white
hands
have
never
waved
to
me
save
occasionally
when
i
have
gone
in
the
sixth
avenue
elevated
but
it
is
my
honest
belief
that
my
sword
would
promptly
leave
its
scabbard
if
the
hand
ever
waved
from
the
ivied
tower
she
nodded
her
pleasure
in
this
avowal
for
a
i
was
doing
well
in
fact
as
i
submitted
to
miss
octavia
examination
i
felt
equal
to
charging
a
brigade
something
about
the
woman
made
it
possible
and
pleasant
to
be
absurd
if
a
king
or
an
emperor
of
europe
should
ask
you
to
inspect
his
chimneys
would
you
be
content
to
perform
your
service
in
the
most
expeditious
and
professional
manner
and
depart
with
a
nominal
fee
decidedly
not
miss
hollister
on
the
other
hand
i
should
nurse
the
job
for
all
it
was
worth
plunder
the
public
treasury
explore
the
dungeons
make
love
to
the
princesses
and
free
the
rightful
heir
to
the
throne
from
his
cell
beneath
the
bosom
of
the
lake
my
friends
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
would
have
heard
this
avowal
with
some
surprise
for
no
man
life
had
ever
been
tamer
than
mine
i
am
by
nature
timid
and
fall
but
a
little
short
of
being
afraid
of
the
dark
prayers
for
deliverance
from
battle
murder
and
sudden
death
can
not
be
too
strongly
expressed
for
me
my
answer
had
however
pleased
miss
octavia
and
she
clapped
her
hands
with
pleasure
cecilia
she
cried
something
told
me
that
afternoon
at
the
asolando
that
my
belief
in
the
potential
seven
was
not
and
now
you
see
that
in
introducing
myself
to
ames
at
the
seventh
table
from
the
door
in
the
seventh
shop
from
fifth
avenue
i
was
led
to
a
meeting
with
a
gentleman
i
had
been
predestined
to
know
as
we
talked
further
a
servant
appeared
and
laid
fresh
logs
across
the
fire
this
i
thought
would
suggest
to
miss
hollister
the
professional
character
of
my
visit
but
the
fire
kindled
readily
the
smoke
rose
freely
in
the
flue
and
miss
hollister
paid
no
attention
to
it
other
than
to
ask
the
man
whether
the
fuel
he
had
taken
from
a
carved
box
at
the
right
of
the
hearth
was
from
the
upper
orchard
or
cherry
from
a
tree
which
it
appeared
she
had
felled
herself
it
was
the
man
informed
her
and
she
continued
talking
the
merits
of
i
think
it
was
that
held
us
for
half
an
hour
cecilia
and
i
listening
with
respect
to
what
in
my
ignorance
seemed
a
remarkable
fund
of
knowledge
on
this
recondite
subject
we
dine
at
seven
ames
and
you
may
amuse
yourself
as
you
like
until
that
hour
cecilia
you
may
order
dinner
in
the
certainly
aunt
octavia
once
more
i
glanced
at
the
girl
hoping
that
some
glimmer
in
her
eyes
would
set
me
right
and
establish
a
common
understanding
and
sympathy
between
us
but
she
was
moving
out
of
the
room
at
her
aunt
side
the
man
who
had
tended
the
fire
met
me
in
the
hall
and
conducting
me
to
my
room
suggested
various
offices
that
he
was
ready
to
perform
for
my
comfort
the
house
faced
south
and
my
windows
midway
of
the
east
wing
afforded
a
fine
view
of
the
hills
the
room
was
large
enough
for
a
chamber
of
state
and
its
furniture
was
massive
a
invited
to
luxurious
repose
half
a
dozen
etchings
by
famous
artists
parrish
and
van
elten
among
them
hung
upon
the
walls
and
on
a
table
beside
the
bed
stood
a
handsome
decanter
and
glasses
reinforced
by
the
quart
of
scotch
which
miss
hollister
had
recommended
for
my
refreshment
my
bag
had
been
opened
and
my
things
put
out
so
that
there
being
more
than
an
hour
to
pass
before
i
need
dress
for
dinner
i
went
below
and
explored
the
garden
and
wandered
off
along
a
winding
path
that
stole
with
charming
furtiveness
toward
a
venerable
orchard
of
gnarled
apple
trees
from
the
height
thus
gained
i
looked
down
upon
the
house
and
caught
a
glimpse
beyond
it
of
one
of
the
chain
of
lakes
on
which
the
westering
sun
glinted
goldenly
thus
seeing
the
house
from
a
new
angle
i
was
impressed
as
i
had
not
been
at
first
by
its
size
it
was
a
huge
establishment
and
i
thought
with
envy
of
pepperton
to
whom
such
ample
commissions
were
not
rare
pepperton
i
recalled
a
little
bitterly
had
arrived
whereas
i
who
had
enjoyed
exactly
his
own
training
for
the
architect
profession
had
failed
at
it
and
been
obliged
to
turn
my
hand
to
the
doctoring
of
chimneys
but
i
am
not
a
morbid
person
and
it
is
my
way
to
pluck
such
joy
as
i
may
from
the
fleeting
moment
and
as
i
reflected
upon
the
odd
circumstance
of
my
being
there
my
spirits
rose
miss
hollister
was
beyond
question
a
singular
person
but
her
whims
were
amusing
i
felt
that
she
was
less
cryptic
than
her
niece
and
the
thought
of
cecilia
drove
me
back
upon
jewett
story
of
wiggins
interest
in
that
quarter
i
resolved
to
write
to
wiggins
when
i
got
back
to
town
the
next
day
and
abuse
him
roundly
for
running
off
without
so
much
as
that
most
emphatically
was
not
like
dear
old
wiggins
i
had
been
sitting
on
a
stone
wall
watching
the
shadows
lengthen
i
rose
now
and
followed
the
wall
toward
a
highway
along
which
wagons
and
an
occasional
had
passed
during
my
revery
the
sloping
pasture
was
rough
and
frequently
sent
me
along
at
a
trot
the
wall
that
marked
the
boundary
at
the
roadside
was
hidden
by
a
tangle
of
raspberry
bushes
and
my
foot
turning
on
a
stone
concealed
in
the
wild
grasses
i
fell
clumsily
and
rolled
a
dozen
yards
into
a
tangle
of
the
berry
bushes
as
i
picked
myself
up
i
heard
voices
in
the
road
but
should
have
thought
nothing
of
it
had
i
not
seen
through
a
break
in
the
vines
and
almost
within
reach
of
my
hand
cecilia
hollister
talking
earnestly
to
some
one
not
yet
disclosed
she
was
hatless
but
had
flung
a
over
her
shoulders
the
red
scarlet
lining
of
the
hood
turned
up
about
her
neck
made
an
effective
setting
for
her
noble
head
oh
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
help
you
i
must
even
appear
to
give
you
any
advantage
i
went
into
it
with
my
eyes
open
and
i
in
honor
bound
not
to
tell
you
anything
you
have
said
nothing
nothing
remember
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
between
us
but
i
must
say
everything
i
refuse
to
be
blinded
by
these
absurd
restrictions
whatever
they
are
it
not
fair
it
inviting
me
into
a
game
where
the
cards
are
not
all
on
the
table
i
come
to
make
an
end
of
it
my
hands
had
suffered
by
contact
with
the
briars
and
i
had
been
ministering
to
them
with
my
handkerchief
but
i
fell
back
upon
the
slope
in
my
astonishment
at
this
colloquy
cecilia
hollister
i
had
seen
plainly
enough
though
the
man
back
had
been
toward
me
but
anywhere
on
earth
i
should
have
known
wiggins
voice
i
protest
that
it
is
not
my
way
to
become
an
eavesdropper
voluntarily
but
to
disclose
myself
now
was
impossible
if
it
had
not
been
wiggins
but
wiggins
would
never
have
understood
or
forgiven
nor
could
i
have
explained
plausibly
to
cecilia
hollister
that
i
had
not
followed
her
from
the
house
to
spy
upon
her
i
should
have
made
the
noise
of
an
invading
army
if
i
had
attempted
to
effect
an
exit
by
creeping
out
through
the
windrow
of
crisp
leaves
in
which
i
lay
and
to
turn
back
and
ascend
the
slope
the
way
i
had
come
would
have
been
to
advertise
my
presence
to
the
figures
in
the
road
there
seemed
nothing
for
me
but
to
keep
still
and
hope
that
this
discussion
between
cecilia
hollister
and
hartley
wiggins
would
not
be
continued
within
earshot
to
my
relief
they
moved
a
trifle
farther
on
but
i
still
heard
their
voices
illustration
this
discussion
between
cecilia
hollister
and
hartley
wiggins
i
can
not
listen
to
you
now
that
i
committed
i
can
not
honorably
countenance
you
at
all
and
i
can
explain
nothing
i
came
here
to
meet
you
only
to
tell
you
this
you
must
go
please
and
do
not
attempt
to
see
me
in
this
way
again
i
was
grateful
that
wiggins
voice
sank
so
low
in
his
reply
that
i
did
not
hear
it
but
i
knew
that
he
was
pleading
hard
then
a
motor
flashed
by
and
when
the
whir
of
its
passing
had
ceased
the
voices
were
inaudible
but
a
moment
later
i
heard
a
light
quick
step
beyond
the
wall
and
cecilia
passed
hurriedly
her
face
turned
toward
the
house
the
cape
was
drawn
tightly
about
her
shoulders
and
she
walked
with
her
head
bowed
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
when
i
felt
safe
from
detection
climbed
the
slope
pausing
on
the
crest
to
survey
the
landscape
i
saw
a
man
wearing
a
derby
hat
and
a
light
leaning
against
a
fence
that
inclosed
a
pasture
as
i
glanced
in
his
direction
he
moved
away
hastily
toward
the
road
below
the
feeling
of
being
watched
is
not
agreeable
and
i
could
not
account
for
him
as
he
passed
out
of
sight
still
another
man
appeared
emerging
from
a
strip
of
woodland
farther
on
even
through
the
evening
haze
i
should
have
said
that
he
was
a
gentleman
the
two
men
apparently
bore
no
relation
to
each
other
though
they
were
walking
in
the
same
direction
bound
i
judged
for
the
highway
below
i
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
they
had
both
been
observing
me
though
for
what
purpose
i
could
not
imagine
then
once
more
just
as
i
was
about
to
enter
the
italian
garden
from
a
fallow
field
that
hung
slightly
above
it
a
third
man
appeared
as
mysteriously
as
though
he
had
sprung
from
the
ground
and
ran
at
a
sharp
along
the
fence
headed
like
the
others
for
the
road
in
the
third
instance
the
stranger
undoubtedly
took
pains
to
hide
his
face
but
he
too
was
well
dressed
and
wore
a
and
a
fedora
hat
of
current
style
i
did
not
know
why
these
gentlemen
were
ranging
the
neighborhood
or
what
object
they
had
in
view
but
their
several
appearances
had
interested
me
and
i
went
on
into
the
house
well
satisfied
that
events
of
an
unusual
character
were
likely
to
mark
my
visit
to
the
home
of
miss
octavia
hollister
iv
we
dine
in
the
cecilia
sat
reading
alone
when
i
entered
the
library
shortly
before
the
she
put
down
her
book
and
we
fell
into
fitful
talk
i
took
a
walk
after
tea
i
always
feel
that
sunsets
are
best
seen
from
the
fields
you
ca
quite
do
them
justice
from
windows
she
began
she
seemed
preoccupied
but
this
may
have
been
the
interpretation
of
my
conscience
whose
twinges
reminded
me
unpleasantly
of
my
precipitation
into
the
briar
bushes
at
the
foot
of
the
pasture
where
i
had
witnessed
her
meeting
with
wiggins
my
admiration
gained
new
levels
her
black
evening
gown
became
her
a
band
of
velvet
circled
her
throat
emphasizing
its
firm
whiteness
it
seemed
incredible
that
i
had
seen
her
so
recently
in
the
filmy
dusk
talking
with
so
much
earnestness
to
hartley
wiggins
it
was
my
impression
gained
from
the
few
sentences
i
had
overheard
by
the
road
that
she
did
not
repulse
him
but
that
some
mysterious
difficult
barrier
kept
them
apart
where
i
wondered
was
wiggins
now
and
what
were
to
be
the
further
incidents
of
this
singular
affair
while
we
waited
for
miss
hollister
to
appear
she
continued
to
speak
of
her
joy
in
the
hills
it
is
not
every
one
who
can
admire
a
sunset
with
sincerity
but
she
conveyed
the
spirit
of
the
phenomena
that
had
attended
the
lowering
of
the
bright
targe
of
day
in
terms
and
tones
that
were
delightfully
natural
and
convincing
and
yet
the
look
in
her
eyes
suggested
inevitably
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
and
the
phrases
i
had
caught
by
the
roadside
wiggins
was
in
her
recollection
of
the
glowing
landscape
i
was
confident
of
this
and
poor
wiggins
was
even
now
wandering
these
hills
no
doubt
brooding
upon
his
troubles
under
the
clear
october
stars
dinner
was
announced
the
moment
miss
hollister
entered
and
i
walked
out
between
them
miss
octavia
hollister
was
a
surprising
person
but
in
nothing
was
she
so
delightfully
wayward
as
in
the
gowns
she
wore
my
ignorance
of
such
matters
is
immeasurable
but
i
fancy
that
she
designed
her
own
raiment
and
that
her
ideas
were
thereupon
carried
out
by
a
tailor
of
skill
at
the
asolando
and
when
we
had
met
at
tea
in
her
own
house
she
had
worn
the
severest
of
tailored
gowns
with
short
skirt
and
a
coat
into
whose
pockets
she
was
fond
of
thrusting
her
hands
the
material
was
lavender
silk
trimmed
in
white
but
the
skirt
had
not
lengthened
and
over
a
white
silk
waist
she
wore
a
kind
of
coat
that
matched
the
skirt
an
aigrette
in
her
lovely
white
hair
contributed
a
piquant
note
to
the
whole
impression
as
we
passed
down
the
hall
she
talked
with
great
animation
of
the
hague
tribunal
just
then
holding
a
prominent
place
in
the
newspapers
for
some
reason
that
has
escaped
me
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
perfectly
absurd
i
know
of
nothing
that
would
contribute
more
to
human
enjoyment
than
a
real
war
between
germany
and
england
the
hague
idea
is
pure
sentimentalism
if
sentimentalism
can
ever
be
said
to
be
pure
i
will
go
further
and
say
that
i
consider
it
positively
immoral
this
new
view
of
the
matter
left
me
stammering
cecilia
i
saw
had
no
intention
of
helping
me
over
these
difficult
hurdles
that
were
constantly
popping
up
in
my
conversations
with
her
aunt
this
delightful
old
lady
in
lavender
the
mistress
of
a
house
whose
luxury
and
peace
were
antipodal
to
any
hint
of
war
continued
to
baffle
me
she
had
ordered
dinner
in
the
but
i
thought
this
merely
a
turn
of
her
humor
and
i
was
taken
aback
when
she
led
the
way
into
a
low
heavily
raftered
room
where
electric
sconces
of
an
odd
type
were
thrust
at
irregular
intervals
along
the
walls
which
were
otherwise
hung
with
arms
of
many
sorts
in
orderly
combinations
they
were
not
the
litter
of
antique
shops
i
saw
in
a
hasty
glance
but
rifles
and
guns
of
the
latest
patterns
and
beside
the
sideboard
stood
a
and
a
cabinet
which
i
assumed
contained
still
other
and
perhaps
deadlier
weapons
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
just
behind
miss
hollister
was
a
sunburst
of
swords
which
gleamed
with
a
kind
of
mockery
behind
her
white
head
the
small
round
table
was
conventionally
set
but
this
only
added
to
the
grimness
of
the
encompassing
arsenal
a
bowl
of
crimson
roses
in
the
centre
of
the
snowy
cloth
would
ordinarily
have
mitigated
the
effect
of
the
grim
walls
but
i
confess
that
the
color
reminded
me
a
little
too
sombrely
of
the
ugly
business
for
which
this
steel
had
been
designed
but
for
the
presence
of
miss
cecilia
who
was
essentially
typical
of
our
american
woman
i
think
i
might
readily
have
yielded
to
the
illusion
that
i
was
the
guest
of
some
eccentric
chatelaine
who
had
invited
me
to
dine
with
her
in
a
bastion
of
her
fortress
before
ordering
me
to
some
chamber
of
horrors
for
execution
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
one
of
those
keen
blades
on
the
wall
might
not
find
its
way
through
my
ribs
between
a
highly
satisfactory
plate
of
à
la
and
a
bit
of
that
would
have
honored
any
kitchen
in
the
land
no
reference
was
made
to
the
character
of
the
room
i
felt
in
fact
that
cecilia
rather
pleaded
with
her
eyes
that
i
should
make
no
reference
to
it
and
miss
hollister
remarked
quite
casually
as
though
in
comment
upon
my
thoughts
consistency
has
buried
its
thousands
and
habit
its
tens
of
thousands
we
should
live
ames
for
the
changes
and
chances
of
this
troubled
life
between
an
and
a
villa
at
newport
many
of
my
best
friends
have
perished
i
have
thought
myself
that
thoreau
had
the
right
idea
i
began
hopefully
but
she
raised
her
finger
warningly
ames
the
mention
of
henry
david
thoreau
is
wholly
distasteful
to
me
a
man
who
will
deliberately
choose
to
whittle
for
chipmunks
and
write
a
book
about
a
moist
like
cape
cod
arouses
no
sympathy
in
me
and
these
women
who
are
forever
gathering
autumn
leaves
or
who
tire
you
in
spring
by
telling
you
they
have
found
the
first
feathering
and
who
make
all
nature
odious
by
their
general
bore
me
to
death
there
is
no
such
thing
possible
as
the
simple
life
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
that
it
is
only
in
the
most
complex
existence
that
the
spirit
of
man
can
thrive
i
am
only
a
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
any
headway
in
discussing
things
æsthetic
sentimental
or
spiritual
with
persons
of
sound
conviction
in
such
matters
a
bishop
with
whom
i
once
roamed
the
english
cathedrals
confessed
to
me
his
sincere
belief
that
in
the
days
of
the
inquisition
the
gridiron
would
have
been
my
rightful
portion
i
was
fearful
lest
my
hostess
should
suggest
the
mediæval
church
as
a
topic
and
this
i
knew
would
be
disastrous
as
an
abbess
she
would
i
fancied
have
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
but
with
startling
abruptness
she
put
down
her
fork
and
bending
her
wonderfully
direct
gaze
upon
me
asked
a
question
that
caused
me
to
strangle
on
a
bit
of
asparagus
i
imagine
ames
that
you
are
a
member
of
some
of
the
better
clubs
in
town
if
by
any
chance
you
belong
to
the
hare
and
tortoise
the
name
of
which
has
always
pleased
me
do
you
by
any
chance
happen
to
enjoy
the
acquaintance
of
hartley
wiggins
cecilia
lifted
her
head
i
saw
that
she
had
been
as
startled
as
i
it
crossed
my
mind
that
a
denial
of
any
acquaintance
with
wiggins
might
best
serve
him
in
the
circumstances
but
i
am
not
i
hope
without
a
sense
of
shame
and
i
responded
promptly
yes
i
know
him
well
we
are
old
friends
i
always
see
a
good
deal
of
him
during
the
winter
his
summers
are
spent
usually
on
his
ranch
in
the
west
we
dined
together
two
days
ago
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
just
before
he
left
for
the
west
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
it
is
wholly
to
his
credit
that
he
has
forsworn
the
professions
and
identified
himself
with
the
honorable
calling
of
the
husbandman
we
met
wiggins
while
traveling
abroad
last
summer
interposed
cecilia
meeting
my
eyes
quite
frankly
met
him
did
you
say
met
him
cecilia
on
the
contrary
we
found
him
waiting
for
us
at
the
dock
the
morning
we
sailed
corrected
miss
hollister
and
we
never
lost
him
a
day
in
three
months
of
rapid
travel
i
had
never
met
him
before
but
i
can
not
deny
that
he
made
himself
exceedingly
agreeable
if
as
i
suspected
he
had
deliberately
planned
to
travel
on
the
same
steamer
with
my
two
nieces
i
have
only
praise
for
his
conduct
for
in
these
days
ames
it
warms
my
heart
to
find
young
men
showing
something
of
the
old
chivalric
ardor
in
their
affairs
of
the
heart
i
sure
wiggins
made
himself
very
agreeable
remarked
cecilia
colorlessly
for
myself
retorted
miss
hollister
i
should
speak
even
more
strongly
he
repeatedly
served
us
with
tact
and
delicacy
and
i
recall
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
his
vigorous
chastisement
of
our
courier
in
cologne
where
that
person
was
found
to
have
treated
us
in
the
most
treacherous
manner
he
had
in
fact
in
collusion
with
an
connived
at
the
loss
of
our
baggage
to
delay
our
departure
even
after
i
had
pronounced
the
cathedral
the
greatest
architectural
monstrosity
in
europe
oh
aunt
octavia
you
did
really
mean
that
and
cecilia
laughed
for
the
first
time
her
color
had
risen
and
her
dark
eyes
lit
with
pleasure
i
had
formed
so
high
an
opinion
of
wiggins
miss
octavia
continued
that
i
learned
with
sincerest
regret
that
his
ancestors
were
tories
and
took
no
part
in
the
struggle
for
american
independence
there
are
times
when
i
seriously
question
the
wisdom
of
the
colonists
in
breaking
with
the
mother
country
but
certainly
no
man
of
character
in
that
day
could
have
hesitated
as
to
his
proper
course
then
as
though
by
intention
miss
hollister
dropped
upon
the
smooth
current
of
our
talk
a
sentence
that
drove
the
color
from
face
at
once
the
girl
was
cold
again
and
i
felt
embarrassed
and
uncomfortable
that
a
friend
of
mine
had
been
brought
into
the
conversation
to
my
befuddlement
the
situation
was
trying
but
in
spite
of
this
it
grew
steadily
more
interesting
hezekiah
and
wiggins
were
the
best
of
friends
was
miss
hollister
remark
cecilia
eyes
were
on
her
plate
but
her
aunt
went
on
in
her
blithest
fashion
you
may
not
know
that
hezekiah
is
another
niece
cecilia
sister
she
was
named
at
my
suggestion
for
my
father
there
being
no
son
in
the
family
and
i
trust
that
so
unusual
a
name
in
a
young
girl
does
not
strike
you
as
indefensible
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
wholly
refreshing
and
delightful
as
i
recall
the
of
my
youth
hezekiah
was
a
monarch
of
great
authority
whose
animosity
toward
sennacherib
was
justified
in
the
fullest
degree
the
very
name
bristles
with
spears
and
is
musical
with
the
trumpets
of
israel
nothing
would
make
me
happier
than
to
meet
the
young
lady
who
bears
this
illustrious
name
as
to
your
knowledge
of
ancient
history
ames
began
miss
hollister
as
she
helped
herself
to
the
cheese
sweets
i
noted
were
not
included
in
the
very
ample
meal
i
had
enjoyed
it
is
clear
that
you
were
well
taught
in
your
youth
i
am
not
surprised
however
for
i
should
have
expected
nothing
less
of
a
son
of
the
late
general
ames
of
hartford
as
to
meeting
my
niece
hezekiah
i
fear
that
that
is
at
present
impossible
while
cecilia
remains
with
me
hezekiah
duty
is
to
her
father
and
i
must
say
in
all
kindness
that
hezekiah
ways
like
those
of
providence
and
the
are
beyond
my
feeble
understanding
in
a
word
ames
hezekiah
is
different
hezekiah
added
cecilia
with
feeling
is
a
dear
please
do
bring
sentimentalism
to
the
table
cried
miss
hollister
wiggins
once
informed
me
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
it
was
at
fontainebleau
i
remember
when
hezekiah
persisted
in
reminding
a
french
colonel
who
was
hanging
about
that
we
named
cities
in
america
for
bismarck
it
was
there
at
the
inn
that
wiggins
confided
to
me
his
belief
that
hezekiah
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
common
or
domestic
peach
as
a
single
peach
at
that
place
was
charged
in
the
bill
at
ten
francs
the
remark
was
to
say
the
least
but
wiggins
was
so
contrite
when
i
rebuked
him
that
i
allowed
him
to
pay
for
our
luncheon
no
small
matter
indeed
for
hezekiah
appetite
is
nothing
if
not
robust
the
had
yielded
little
light
on
the
subject
of
predicament
whatever
that
might
be
but
these
references
to
the
absent
hezekiah
had
set
a
troop
of
interrogation
points
to
dancing
on
the
frontiers
of
my
curiosity
miss
hollister
had
given
so
many
turns
to
the
conversation
that
i
could
reach
no
conclusion
as
to
her
feeling
toward
wiggins
or
hezekiah
hollister
and
as
for
cecilia
i
was
unable
to
determine
whether
she
was
a
prisoner
at
hopefield
manor
or
the
willing
and
devoted
companion
of
her
aunt
in
this
bewildered
state
of
mind
while
we
lingered
over
our
coffee
the
servant
appeared
with
a
card
for
each
of
the
ladies
i
saw
cecilia
start
as
she
read
the
name
wiggins
how
remarkable
that
he
should
have
appeared
just
as
we
were
speaking
of
him
said
miss
hollister
be
sure
the
gentleman
is
comfortable
in
the
library
james
we
shall
be
in
at
once
ames
you
will
of
course
be
delighted
to
meet
your
friend
here
and
you
will
assist
us
in
dispensing
our
meagre
hospitality
v
the
strange
behavior
of
a
chimney
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
hartley
wiggins
should
not
call
upon
two
ladies
living
in
westchester
county
and
i
must
say
that
he
appeared
to
advantage
in
miss
hollister
library
he
had
got
into
his
evening
clothes
somewhere
perhaps
at
a
neighboring
inn
or
maybe
at
the
house
of
a
friend
for
he
could
not
possibly
have
motored
into
town
and
back
since
his
interview
with
cecilia
in
the
highway
he
had
impressed
the
clerk
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
with
the
idea
that
he
had
left
new
york
for
a
long
absence
and
he
had
apparently
camped
at
the
gates
of
hopefield
to
be
near
cecilia
when
he
had
paid
his
compliments
to
the
ladies
he
turned
to
me
with
an
almost
imperceptible
lifting
of
the
brows
but
he
was
cordial
enough
if
he
was
surprised
or
disappointed
at
seeing
me
his
manner
did
not
betray
the
feeling
glad
to
see
you
ames
rather
nice
weather
this
even
dakota
could
do
better
i
affirmed
with
a
grin
but
he
ignored
the
fling
it
is
quite
remarkable
wiggins
that
you
should
have
appeared
just
when
you
did
for
we
had
been
speaking
of
you
and
i
had
been
telling
ames
of
our
travels
abroad
and
in
particular
of
the
thumping
you
very
properly
gave
our
courier
at
cologne
and
i
shall
not
deny
that
i
mentioned
also
our
brief
discussion
of
the
at
fontainebleau
cecilia
stirred
restlessly
wiggins
shot
a
glance
of
inquiry
in
my
direction
and
i
felt
decidedly
ill
at
ease
miss
hollister
crossed
to
the
fireplace
and
poked
the
logs
just
what
part
hezekiah
hollister
played
in
the
situation
was
beyond
me
if
i
had
not
witnessed
wiggins
clandestine
meeting
with
cecilia
matters
would
have
been
clearer
to
my
comprehension
but
his
appearance
at
the
house
after
the
colloquy
i
had
overheard
from
the
briar
patch
was
in
itself
inexplicable
cecilia
was
a
woman
therefore
to
be
wooed
and
yet
she
had
indicated
by
her
words
to
him
that
the
wooing
independently
of
her
feeling
and
inclination
might
not
go
forward
with
entire
freedom
miss
hollister
singular
references
to
hezekiah
a
person
about
whom
my
curiosity
was
now
a
good
deal
aroused
added
to
the
mystery
that
enfolded
the
library
our
american
peaches
are
not
what
they
were
in
my
youth
cold
storage
destroys
the
flavor
i
have
not
tasted
a
decent
peach
for
twenty
years
this
was
pretty
tame
i
admit
but
i
felt
that
i
must
say
something
responsive
to
miss
hollister
energetic
prodding
the
flames
in
the
fireplace
leaped
into
the
great
throat
of
the
chimney
with
a
roar
she
turned
her
back
to
the
blaze
and
looked
upon
her
guests
benignantly
if
all
your
flues
draw
like
that
one
they
are
not
seriously
in
need
of
doctoring
i
remarked
feeling
that
flues
were
a
safer
topic
than
the
flues
are
nothing
if
not
erratic
replied
miss
hollister
the
subject
did
not
appear
to
interest
her
nor
had
she
by
the
remotest
suggestion
referred
to
the
object
of
my
coming
i
had
sniffed
vainly
in
the
halls
above
and
below
for
any
trace
of
the
stale
smoke
which
usually
greeted
me
at
once
on
my
arrival
at
the
house
of
a
client
the
air
of
hopefield
manor
was
as
sweet
as
that
of
a
june
meadow
wiggins
remarked
to
me
that
i
doubtless
knew
the
manor
had
been
designed
by
pepperton
whom
we
both
knew
well
this
is
pep
masterpiece
he
need
do
nothing
better
to
keep
his
grip
at
the
top
he
said
i
consider
it
a
great
privilege
to
be
permitted
to
visit
a
house
designed
by
a
dear
friend
and
occupied
by
a
lady
peculiarly
fitted
to
appreciate
and
adorn
it
i
thought
rather
well
of
this
as
i
spoke
the
words
but
neither
cecilia
nor
wiggins
rose
to
it
as
i
hoped
they
might
you
have
a
neat
turn
for
the
direct
compliment
said
miss
hollister
promptly
the
house
was
built
you
may
not
know
for
a
manufacturer
of
umbrellas
who
died
before
he
had
occupied
it
in
circumstances
i
may
later
disclose
to
you
which
accounts
ames
for
that
figure
of
cupid
under
a
pink
parasol
on
the
ceiling
at
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
remove
it
as
baby
cupids
are
irreconcilable
with
the
militant
i
admire
i
consider
umbrellas
detestable
and
never
carry
one
when
i
can
command
a
mackintosh
when
i
on
the
ranch
i
wear
a
slicker
said
wiggins
and
that
i
have
found
at
times
a
decided
advantage
we
discussed
mackintoshes
for
at
least
ten
minutes
with
far
more
sprightliness
than
i
had
imagined
the
subject
could
evoke
then
miss
hollister
after
a
turn
up
and
down
the
room
paused
beside
me
ames
she
said
would
you
care
to
join
me
in
a
game
of
billiards
i
not
in
my
best
form
but
i
think
we
might
profitably
knock
the
balls
for
half
an
hour
i
acquiesced
with
alacrity
i
assumed
it
to
be
miss
purpose
to
leave
cecilia
and
wiggins
alone
i
should
be
rendering
wiggins
and
cecilia
a
service
by
withdrawing
and
i
was
glad
of
a
chance
to
escape
to
my
infinite
surprise
they
both
protested
not
in
mere
polite
murmurs
but
with
considerable
vehemence
it
quite
cool
and
i
do
believe
you
ought
to
use
the
until
the
plumber
has
fixed
the
radiator
said
cecilia
and
if
you
knew
ames
game
i
sure
you
would
care
to
waste
time
on
him
piped
wiggins
whom
i
had
frequently
vanquished
in
billiard
bouts
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
where
i
may
say
modestly
i
had
long
been
considered
one
of
the
most
formidable
of
the
players
both
he
and
cecilia
had
risen
and
we
stood
i
remember
just
before
the
hearth
during
this
exchange
at
this
moment
a
singular
thing
happened
the
fire
that
had
been
sweeping
in
a
broad
curve
into
the
chimney
was
checked
suddenly
i
had
repeatedly
marked
the
admirable
draught
the
facile
grace
of
the
flame
as
it
rose
and
vanished
the
cessation
of
the
draught
was
unmarked
by
any
of
those
premonitory
symptoms
by
which
a
fire
usually
gives
warning
of
evil
intentions
the
upward
current
of
air
had
ceased
utterly
and
without
apparent
cause
we
were
all
aware
of
a
choking
a
gasping
in
the
deep
flue
which
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
any
natural
stoppage
incident
to
chimneys
the
dislodging
of
masonry
or
a
packing
of
soot
the
former
was
hardly
possible
and
the
house
was
not
old
enough
to
make
the
latter
theory
plausible
from
my
survey
of
the
flue
on
my
arrival
in
the
afternoon
i
judged
that
this
particular
chimney
had
been
little
used
the
smoke
now
rolled
out
in
billows
and
drove
us
back
from
the
hearth
i
seized
the
tongs
and
poker
and
began
readjusting
the
logs
without
however
any
hope
of
correcting
a
difficulty
that
lay
patently
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
flue
itself
the
smoke
after
a
courageous
effort
to
rise
encountered
an
obstruction
of
some
sort
and
ebbed
back
upon
the
hearth
and
out
into
the
room
my
efforts
to
stop
the
trouble
by
shifting
the
logs
were
futile
as
i
expected
them
to
be
and
i
retreated
quickly
making
i
fear
no
very
gallant
appearance
as
i
mopped
my
face
and
eyes
illustration
i
seized
the
tongs
and
poker
and
began
readjusting
the
logs
well
exclaimed
miss
hollister
who
had
rung
for
a
servant
to
open
the
doors
and
windows
this
is
certainly
most
extraordinary
what
solution
do
you
offer
mr
ames
the
matter
requires
investigation
i
ca
venture
an
opinion
until
i
have
made
a
thorough
investigation
the
night
is
perfectly
quiet
and
the
wind
is
hardly
responsible
i
think
we
had
better
abandon
the
room
until
i
can
solve
this
riddle
in
the
morning
the
prompt
opening
of
the
windows
and
doors
caused
the
slow
dispersion
of
the
smoke
but
the
lights
in
the
room
still
shone
dimly
as
through
a
fog
it
beastly
ejaculated
wiggins
coughing
i
did
suppose
pepperton
would
put
a
flue
like
that
into
a
house
he
ought
to
be
shot
it
is
fortunate
said
miss
hollister
that
ames
is
on
the
ground
he
now
has
a
case
that
will
test
his
most
acute
powers
of
diagnosis
the
logs
that
had
burned
so
brightly
before
the
chimney
choked
still
held
their
flames
stubbornly
and
i
had
advised
against
pouring
water
upon
them
fearing
to
crack
the
brick
and
stonework
we
were
about
to
adjourn
to
the
miss
hollister
and
the
others
had
in
fact
reached
the
door
leaving
me
alone
before
the
hearth
then
as
i
stood
watching
the
smoke
pour
out
into
the
room
and
more
puzzled
than
i
had
ever
been
before
in
any
of
my
employments
the
chimney
with
a
deep
intake
of
breath
began
drawing
the
smoke
upward
again
the
flames
caught
and
spread
with
renewed
ardor
and
when
the
trio
still
loitering
in
the
hall
returned
in
answer
to
my
exclamation
of
surprise
the
flue
had
recovered
its
composure
and
was
behaving
in
a
sane
and
normal
manner
there
is
i
imagine
nothing
pertaining
to
the
life
of
man
unless
it
be
rival
climates
or
pianos
that
so
inspires
incompetent
irrelevant
and
immaterial
criticism
as
wayward
fireplaces
it
is
part
of
my
business
to
listen
respectfully
to
opinions
to
receive
with
an
appearance
of
credulity
the
theories
of
others
and
those
advanced
in
miss
hollister
library
were
not
below
the
average
to
which
i
was
accustomed
a
swallow
undoubtedly
fell
into
the
and
then
got
itself
out
again
suggested
cecilia
the
logs
must
have
been
wet
the
sap
had
dried
out
yet
proposed
wiggins
the
wood
was
as
dry
as
tinder
averred
miss
hollister
not
without
irritation
and
one
swallow
does
not
make
a
summer
or
a
chimney
smoke
it
must
have
been
a
changing
current
of
air
i
was
reading
a
book
on
ballooning
the
other
day
and
it
is
remarkable
how
the
air
currents
change
that
is
quite
possible
as
the
air
cools
rapidly
after
sunset
at
this
season
and
that
is
bound
to
have
an
effect
on
the
quality
and
resistance
of
the
atmosphere
i
replied
sagely
perhaps
suggested
miss
hollister
with
one
of
those
flashes
of
animation
that
were
so
delightful
in
her
perhaps
it
was
a
ghost
will
you
tell
us
ames
whether
in
your
experience
you
have
ever
known
a
chimney
ghost
as
i
had
no
opinion
of
my
own
as
to
what
had
caused
the
chimney
brief
aberration
i
was
glad
to
follow
miss
hollister
lead
i
have
had
several
experiences
with
ghosts
i
began
though
i
should
not
like
you
to
think
that
i
profess
any
special
genius
for
the
analysis
of
psychical
phenomena
but
there
was
a
house
at
shinnecock
that
was
reputed
to
be
haunted
the
chimney
behaved
damnably
the
house
was
one
of
buffington
buffington
you
know
was
quite
capable
of
building
a
house
and
omitting
any
stairway
we
used
to
say
at
the
club
that
he
ought
to
have
specialized
in
houses
where
the
men
do
use
stairways
but
slide
down
a
pole
well
the
chimney
in
this
particular
house
could
be
made
to
draw
with
a
team
of
elephants
and
it
had
also
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
strange
flutings
of
the
weirdest
and
most
distressing
kind
were
often
heard
at
night
the
owner
gave
up
in
despair
and
moved
out
turning
the
house
over
to
me
after
eliminating
all
other
possibilities
i
decided
that
the
piping
spook
must
be
related
to
the
disorder
in
the
chimney
it
served
two
fireplaces
and
i
proceeded
to
knock
the
kinks
out
of
it
so
it
did
tie
knots
in
a
as
at
first
but
believe
me
when
it
stopped
smoking
it
still
whistled
in
the
most
fantastical
fashion
i
was
living
in
the
house
with
only
the
servants
about
and
for
a
week
gave
my
whole
thought
to
this
flue
the
ghostly
flutist
was
an
amateur
but
he
tried
his
hand
at
every
sort
of
tune
from
in
our
alley
to
the
jewel
song
in
faust
the
whistling
did
begin
till
nearly
midnight
and
continued
usually
for
about
an
hour
i
tried
in
every
way
to
lure
him
into
the
open
and
i
fell
downstairs
one
night
as
i
crept
about
in
the
dark
trying
to
trace
the
sound
and
to
what
palpable
and
mundane
source
do
you
suppose
i
traced
that
ghost
i
never
should
guess
murmured
cecilia
unless
it
was
merely
the
weird
whistling
of
the
wind
nothing
so
poetical
i
sorry
to
confess
it
was
the
butler
in
his
nightly
cups
his
soul
inclined
to
music
and
being
a
timid
soul
fearful
of
the
cynical
tongues
of
the
other
servants
he
crawled
into
the
in
the
cellar
which
communicated
with
the
several
fireplaces
above
and
there
indulged
himself
gently
upon
the
tuneful
reed
the
night
i
caught
him
he
was
breathing
the
wild
strains
of
brunhilde
into
the
tube
and
it
was
shuddersome
i
can
tell
you
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
discharge
him
on
the
spot
and
the
grateful
owner
returned
the
next
day
the
presence
of
a
ghost
in
this
house
would
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
declared
miss
hollister
who
had
listened
intently
to
my
recital
i
should
look
upon
a
ghost
appearance
at
hopefield
manor
as
a
great
compliment
if
any
reputable
decent
ghost
should
by
any
chance
take
up
his
residence
in
this
house
i
should
give
him
every
encouragement
miss
hollister
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
proposed
game
of
billiards
the
chimney
lawless
demonstration
had
in
fact
given
a
new
turn
to
the
evening
we
discussed
ghosts
for
half
an
hour
and
then
without
having
enjoyed
any
opportunity
for
a
single
private
word
with
cecilia
wiggins
rose
to
leave
he
shook
hands
all
around
and
bowed
from
the
door
it
was
in
my
mind
to
follow
making
a
pretext
of
walking
with
him
to
the
station
or
of
helping
him
find
his
car
but
nothing
in
his
to
me
encouraged
such
attentions
and
as
i
pondered
the
outer
door
closed
upon
my
irresolution
at
the
stroke
of
ten
miss
hollister
rose
and
excused
herself
we
breakfast
at
eight
ames
i
trust
the
hour
does
not
conflict
with
your
habits
i
assured
her
that
the
hour
was
wholly
agreeable
and
she
gave
me
her
hand
with
great
dignity
when
i
turned
toward
cecilia
she
had
moved
to
a
seat
close
by
the
hearth
and
was
gazing
dreamily
into
the
fire
now
a
bed
of
glowing
coals
it
was
odd
i
remarked
you
mean
the
chimney
yes
it
was
quite
unaccountable
i
confess
that
i
never
knew
a
chimney
mood
to
change
so
abruptly
she
sat
silent
for
several
minutes
and
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
eyes
met
mine
pardon
me
ames
but
did
my
aunt
ask
you
here
to
examine
the
chimneys
i
did
quite
understand
we
have
been
here
only
a
week
the
weather
has
been
warm
and
i
believe
this
fire
had
not
been
lighted
before
you
will
pardon
my
frankness
but
i
ca
quite
understand
why
my
aunt
invited
you
here
if
you
came
professionally
i
thought
when
you
appeared
this
afternoon
that
you
were
a
guest
nothing
more
or
less
you
had
heard
nothing
of
any
trouble
with
the
fireplaces
then
i
am
in
the
dark
as
much
as
you
as
i
understood
it
i
was
called
here
to
examine
the
flues
but
now
that
i
think
of
it
she
did
not
say
explicitly
that
her
chimneys
were
behaving
badly
though
that
was
of
course
implied
i
naturally
assumed
that
she
summoned
me
here
in
my
professional
capacity
i
was
a
stranger
to
your
aunt
she
would
hardly
have
invited
me
otherwise
she
turned
again
to
the
fire
as
though
referring
to
it
for
counsel
her
perplexity
was
no
greater
than
my
own
it
was
certainly
an
extraordinary
experience
to
be
invited
to
a
strange
house
where
my
services
had
not
been
needed
and
to
find
that
an
apparently
sound
chimney
had
begun
to
smoke
at
once
as
though
in
mockery
of
my
presence
i
imagine
however
that
your
aunt
acts
a
good
deal
on
impulse
her
asking
me
here
may
have
been
only
a
whim
please
do
imagine
that
your
coming
has
not
been
agreeable
to
me
cecilia
protested
my
aunt
is
quite
capable
of
inviting
a
stranger
to
the
house
she
met
you
i
believe
at
the
asolando
i
hope
you
understand
that
it
is
only
because
i
am
in
deep
trouble
ames
trouble
of
the
gravest
nature
that
i
have
ventured
to
speak
to
you
in
this
way
of
my
aunt
for
whom
i
have
all
respect
and
affection
she
had
never
i
was
sure
been
lovelier
than
at
this
moment
her
eyes
filled
but
she
lifted
her
head
proudly
whatever
the
trouble
might
be
i
was
sorry
for
it
on
her
own
account
and
if
it
involved
hartley
wiggins
my
sympathy
went
out
to
him
also
on
an
impulse
i
spoke
of
him
i
was
surprised
to
meet
hartley
wiggins
here
he
a
dear
friend
of
mine
you
know
i
thought
he
had
gone
to
his
ranch
he
left
the
hare
and
tortoise
very
abruptly
a
few
nights
ago
just
after
we
had
dined
together
he
must
be
stopping
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
it
quite
possible
and
there
an
inn
you
know
i
fancy
he
drove
over
from
there
i
had
thought
of
that
the
prescott
arms
i
suppose
you
mean
she
nodded
but
she
was
clearly
not
interested
in
me
and
when
i
found
myself
failing
dismally
to
divert
her
thoughts
to
cheerfuller
channels
i
rose
and
bade
her
the
servant
who
had
previously
attended
me
appeared
promptly
when
i
reached
my
room
bearing
a
tray
with
biscuits
and
a
bottle
of
ale
he
gave
me
an
envelope
addressed
in
a
hand
i
already
knew
as
miss
octavia
and
i
opened
and
read
the
following
i
either
detest
or
distrust
so
kindly
refrain
from
mentioning
them
while
you
are
a
guest
of
hopefield
manor
automobiles
mashed
potatoes
whiskers
chopin
concerto
in
e
minor
op
bishop
coadjutor
limericks
cats
octavia
hollister
i
absorbed
this
with
a
glass
of
ale
there
were
seven
items
i
noted
and
i
had
no
serious
quarrel
with
her
attitude
toward
any
of
them
but
just
what
these
matters
had
to
do
with
me
or
my
presence
in
her
house
i
could
not
determine
she
had
referred
to
me
in
the
note
as
a
guest
i
had
noted
that
and
i
did
know
moreover
that
miss
octavia
hollister
possessed
a
quaint
and
delicate
humor
and
i
looked
forward
with
the
pleasantest
anticipations
to
our
further
meetings
before
i
slept
i
threw
up
my
window
and
stepped
out
upon
a
narrow
balcony
that
afforded
a
capital
view
of
the
fields
and
woods
to
the
east
the
night
was
fine
with
the
sky
bright
with
stars
and
moon
as
my
eyes
dropped
from
the
horizon
to
the
near
landscape
i
saw
a
man
perched
on
a
knoll
in
the
midst
of
a
he
stood
as
rigid
as
a
sentry
on
duty
or
like
a
forlorn
commander
counting
the
spears
of
his
tattered
battalions
i
was
not
sure
that
he
saw
me
for
the
balcony
was
slightly
shadowed
but
at
any
rate
he
was
sharply
outlined
to
my
vision
his
derby
hat
and
overcoat
gave
him
an
odd
appearance
as
he
stood
brooding
above
the
corn
then
he
vanished
suddenly
though
as
he
retired
toward
the
highway
i
followed
him
for
some
time
by
the
shaking
and
jerking
of
the
i
lay
awake
far
into
the
night
considering
the
events
of
the
day
of
these
the
curious
stoppage
of
the
library
chimney
was
the
least
interesting
i
doubted
whether
it
would
ever
recur
the
of
hartley
wiggins
was
however
a
matter
of
importance
to
me
his
friend
and
i
determined
to
make
every
effort
to
see
him
the
next
day
and
learn
the
exact
status
of
his
affair
with
cecilia
hollister
vi
i
deliver
a
message
i
was
aroused
at
six
the
next
morning
by
the
sound
of
and
springing
out
of
bed
i
beheld
in
an
open
pasture
beyond
the
the
indomitable
miss
hollister
engaged
in
the
pleasing
pastime
of
breaking
clay
pigeons
with
a
her
swedish
maid
stood
by
with
a
formidable
pad
of
paper
keeping
score
a
boy
pulled
the
trap
for
her
and
she
threw
up
her
gun
and
blazed
away
with
a
practised
hand
her
small
slight
tense
figure
awaiting
the
launching
of
the
target
the
quick
of
the
gun
as
she
sighted
and
the
pause
following
the
firing
of
the
shot
in
which
she
bent
forward
rigidly
watching
the
result
were
features
of
a
picture
which
i
would
not
have
missed
my
eye
could
not
follow
the
curving
disc
in
its
flight
but
when
the
shot
told
the
bursting
clay
made
a
little
patch
of
dust
in
the
air
that
was
plainly
visible
from
where
i
sat
beyond
the
on
a
broad
stretch
of
pasture
whose
aftermath
made
a
green
field
about
her
and
against
a
background
of
the
more
distant
woods
tapestry
miss
octavia
hollister
was
a
figure
to
admire
and
i
will
write
it
down
here
and
be
done
with
it
that
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
know
many
delightful
women
but
i
have
never
known
one
more
interesting
or
charming
than
miss
octavia
hollister
the
spirit
of
deathless
youth
was
in
her
heart
and
youth
gay
pennants
fluttered
about
her
as
the
reports
of
her
gun
fell
cheerily
upon
the
crisp
morning
air
a
rebuke
and
a
challenge
to
all
indolent
souls
illustration
she
threw
up
her
gun
and
blazed
away
with
a
practised
hand
i
made
myself
presentable
as
quickly
as
possible
and
went
forth
to
report
to
her
she
nodded
pleasantly
as
i
greeted
her
immediately
after
she
had
scored
a
capital
shot
a
second
gun
was
produced
and
i
saw
that
it
was
not
without
satisfaction
that
she
observed
my
lack
of
prowess
one
out
of
five
was
the
best
i
could
do
whereas
she
smashed
three
with
the
greatest
ease
on
alternate
mornings
she
informed
me
she
shot
glass
balls
with
a
rifle
a
sport
which
she
declared
to
be
superior
to
in
the
severity
of
its
demand
upon
the
nerve
and
eye
if
i
had
known
you
would
be
up
so
early
i
should
have
sent
coffee
to
your
room
she
remarked
as
we
walked
toward
the
house
very
likely
your
lack
of
luck
with
the
birds
is
attributable
entirely
to
the
impoverished
state
of
your
stomach
breakfast
was
served
on
a
delightful
that
i
had
not
before
seen
cecilia
appeared
promptly
having
in
fact
been
gathering
fall
flowers
for
some
time
i
judged
from
the
considerable
armful
of
chrysanthemums
asters
dahlias
and
marigolds
which
we
found
her
arranging
for
the
table
she
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
and
greeted
us
most
amiably
i
heard
the
artillery
booming
and
thought
an
army
had
descended
a
great
regret
to
me
ames
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
any
headway
at
the
traps
i
suffer
from
chronic
and
incurable
i
sorry
archery
has
gone
out
i
think
i
might
have
done
better
with
the
long
bow
pinkle
exclaimed
miss
hollister
disdainfully
i
cured
myself
of
easily
enough
by
having
the
gardener
follow
me
about
whenever
i
took
my
daily
walks
firing
a
gun
at
irregular
intervals
just
behind
me
i
was
threatened
with
deafness
when
i
began
but
the
agitation
of
my
tympanums
by
the
explosions
of
my
gun
has
corrected
the
difficulty
i
have
mentioned
my
discovery
of
this
remedy
to
a
distinguished
aurist
and
he
is
preparing
a
paper
on
the
subject
not
however
without
my
permission
which
he
expects
to
read
shortly
before
one
of
the
most
learned
societies
in
europe
cecilia
the
chops
are
overdone
again
please
remind
me
to
speak
to
the
cook
about
it
if
it
were
not
that
he
is
so
expert
in
detecting
spurious
which
is
constantly
sold
as
a
substitute
for
the
boydville
article
i
should
discharge
him
for
this
an
chop
can
do
much
to
shake
one
faith
in
human
nature
if
i
wanted
to
eat
grilled
patent
leather
i
should
order
it
in
spite
of
her
sharp
observations
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
that
miss
hollister
was
the
gentlest
and
sweetest
of
natures
i
fully
believed
that
her
whims
were
the
honest
expression
of
a
revolt
against
the
tedious
and
conventional
and
nothing
in
my
later
acquaintance
disturbed
this
opinion
it
was
her
privilege
to
do
as
she
liked
and
if
she
preferred
cracking
clay
saucers
with
a
to
knitting
or
darning
stockings
or
gossiping
it
was
no
one
business
the
mail
arrived
and
was
placed
by
her
plate
before
we
left
the
table
she
opened
first
a
bulky
envelope
containing
cuttings
from
a
clipping
bureau
and
she
mused
aloud
upon
these
as
she
read
this
persistent
story
of
a
sunken
galleon
off
the
bolivian
coast
sounds
plausible
but
i
fear
it
is
the
work
of
some
bright
young
journalist
our
minister
in
that
benighted
country
does
take
any
stock
in
it
i
had
a
cable
from
him
yesterday
if
he
had
given
the
story
credence
i
should
have
gone
down
at
once
with
a
steamer
and
crew
of
divers
the
imaginative
young
newspaper
men
continue
romancing
however
and
it
costs
me
five
cents
a
clipping
she
next
opened
a
letter
that
roused
her
to
vigorous
declamation
cecilia
she
began
here
is
a
letter
from
that
stanford
we
met
in
berne
she
encloses
a
card
that
indicates
her
wish
to
be
called
appleby
now
having
i
believe
spent
a
few
months
since
our
meeting
in
one
of
our
american
states
where
the
marital
tie
readily
evaporates
and
shaken
stanford
whom
i
have
heard
spoken
of
in
the
highest
terms
by
persons
of
character
we
live
in
an
era
of
horseless
carriages
wireless
telegraphy
husbandless
wives
and
wifeless
husbands
i
have
hit
upon
a
formula
which
i
am
tempted
to
utilize
hereafter
when
i
meet
husbandless
women
when
they
are
introduced
i
shall
ask
shaken
or
taken
signifying
in
the
first
instance
a
loss
by
way
of
nevada
or
in
the
second
through
the
pearlier
gates
of
that
paradise
which
is
the
hope
of
us
all
ames
as
the
butler
has
gone
to
sleep
in
the
pantry
you
will
kindly
pass
the
salt
she
had
handed
cecilia
a
number
of
letters
which
the
girl
opened
and
then
to
my
surprise
meekly
turned
over
to
her
aunt
miss
hollister
surveyed
them
critically
i
thought
she
remarked
that
that
young
henderson
who
was
so
attentive
to
you
at
madrid
was
an
impostor
and
this
note
settles
the
matter
he
flirted
outrageously
with
hezekiah
behind
your
back
he
asks
if
he
may
call
upon
you
here
if
he
were
the
nephew
of
colonel
abner
henderson
of
roanoke
as
he
represented
himself
to
be
he
would
not
ask
if
he
might
call
upon
you
but
would
have
appeared
at
once
in
his
proper
person
to
pay
his
addresses
an
unchivalrous
and
wobbly
character
who
evidently
expects
you
to
make
the
advances
but
such
are
the
youth
of
our
time
and
besides
cecilia
his
stationery
leaves
much
to
be
desired
as
for
these
other
gentlemen
we
need
not
discuss
them
their
actions
must
speak
for
them
miss
hollister
having
thus
dismissed
her
niece
correspondents
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
library
cecilia
seemed
in
no
wise
depressed
by
her
aunt
fling
at
henderson
whoever
he
might
be
but
threw
the
notes
upon
the
flames
that
blazed
merrily
in
the
fireplace
i
suggested
immediately
that
as
i
had
come
to
hopefield
manor
to
inspect
the
flues
i
should
now
be
about
my
business
but
to
my
surprise
miss
hollister
evinced
no
interest
whatever
in
the
matter
her
tone
and
manner
implied
that
the
condition
of
her
chimneys
was
wholly
negligible
there
is
no
haste
ames
i
have
suffered
all
my
life
from
the
and
hurried
work
of
professional
men
even
the
clergy
and
i
have
enjoyed
the
acquaintance
of
many
are
quite
reckless
in
giving
opinions
i
once
asked
the
bishop
of
waxahaxie
was
it
waxahaxie
cecilia
or
tallahassee
well
it
does
matter
anyhow
whether
he
honestly
believed
there
are
no
women
angels
he
replied
with
unusual
frankness
for
one
in
holy
orders
that
he
did
know
but
added
that
he
was
sure
there
are
angel
women
just
for
that
impertinence
i
cut
in
two
my
subscription
to
his
cathedral
when
i
ask
an
expert
opinion
of
an
educated
person
i
do
intend
to
be
put
off
with
mere
persiflage
and
to
return
to
my
chimneys
i
beg
that
you
give
me
the
result
of
your
most
serious
deliberations
at
this
hour
i
ride
cecilia
will
you
dress
immediately
and
accompany
me
she
disappeared
at
once
and
i
stared
mutely
after
her
i
am
by
no
means
an
idler
and
this
cool
indifference
to
the
value
of
my
time
would
ordinarily
have
enraged
me
but
i
believe
i
laughed
and
when
i
turned
to
cecilia
i
found
her
smiling
i
glad
ames
that
you
are
a
person
of
humor
my
conduct
verifies
what
i
said
to
you
last
night
that
the
flues
in
this
house
have
given
us
no
trouble
that
they
have
indeed
had
little
chance
to
do
so
in
the
short
time
we
have
spent
here
it
is
true
that
this
one
acted
queerly
last
night
and
i
have
wondered
about
its
temporary
sulkiness
a
good
deal
it
will
be
well
of
course
for
you
to
go
over
it
and
all
the
others
in
the
house
it
is
no
joke
that
my
aunt
is
a
believer
in
thoroughness
and
one
of
these
days
when
she
is
ready
to
talk
of
chimneys
she
will
subject
you
to
a
most
rigid
examination
one
of
these
days
why
i
have
looked
at
the
and
it
is
my
present
intention
to
take
the
into
town
i
have
appointments
at
my
office
for
the
afternoon
i
assure
you
miss
hollister
that
i
a
man
of
engagements
particularly
at
this
season
i
remembered
what
jewett
had
told
me
of
fortner
the
painter
and
his
detention
at
newport
by
miss
octavia
hollister
i
had
no
intention
of
being
immured
in
any
such
fashion
and
i
was
about
to
protest
further
when
cecilia
took
a
step
toward
me
and
after
a
glance
at
the
door
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
with
great
earnestness
ames
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
a
gentleman
and
in
that
confident
belief
i
going
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
you
have
said
that
you
know
hartley
wiggins
well
i
know
no
man
better
you
might
not
have
inferred
it
from
his
manner
last
night
but
he
was
undoubtedly
surprised
and
embarrassed
by
my
presence
and
did
not
act
quite
like
himself
i
think
i
understand
the
cause
of
that
if
i
should
ask
you
to
see
him
and
give
him
a
message
for
me
could
you
do
so
it
will
be
an
honor
to
serve
you
and
a
very
simple
matter
as
i
should
see
him
on
my
own
account
if
he
is
still
in
the
neighborhood
he
is
doubtless
at
the
prescott
arms
my
message
is
a
verbal
one
please
urge
him
not
to
make
any
effort
to
see
me
and
not
to
call
here
again
but
at
the
same
time
as
the
chimney
smoked
just
as
we
were
about
to
be
left
alone
last
night
i
think
i
think
she
hesitated
a
moment
you
may
say
that
his
interests
have
not
been
jeopardized
by
his
temerity
in
calling
in
her
pause
before
concluding
this
curious
commission
her
eyes
searched
mine
deeply
and
i
felt
that
she
had
not
lightly
entrusted
me
with
this
singular
errand
her
dark
eyes
held
mine
an
instant
after
she
had
spoken
then
she
smiled
and
her
face
showed
relief
ask
for
anything
you
want
aunt
octavia
despises
motors
so
there
no
car
here
but
you
will
find
plenty
of
horses
and
traps
order
whatever
pleases
you
i
shall
expect
to
meet
you
at
dinner
if
not
at
luncheon
and
so
she
smiled
again
will
aunt
octavia
she
nodded
to
me
from
the
door
and
i
heard
her
running
lightly
upstairs
left
to
my
own
devices
i
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
the
library
fire
extinguished
and
the
hearth
cleaned
this
required
a
little
time
but
the
house
man
obeyed
me
readily
and
soon
clad
in
my
professional
overalls
and
jumper
i
was
going
carefully
over
the
flue
whose
behavior
had
been
so
unaccountable
the
previous
night
guided
by
the
servant
i
inspected
the
three
fireplaces
in
the
upper
chambers
that
were
served
by
flues
in
this
chimney
and
finally
dropped
my
torch
and
from
the
never
in
all
my
experience
had
i
seen
better
flues
but
remembering
my
ghost
at
shinnecock
i
had
the
ashes
thrown
out
of
the
dump
in
the
cellar
and
found
the
chute
in
perfect
order
i
learned
by
inquiry
that
the
other
flues
worked
perfectly
but
i
nevertheless
scrutinized
them
carefully
my
freedom
of
the
house
afforded
an
excellent
opportunity
for
a
study
of
its
beautiful
construction
it
was
modern
in
every
sense
with
no
dark
mysterious
corners
in
which
goblins
might
lurk
i
prowled
about
with
increasing
admiration
for
pepperton
and
with
a
deepening
sense
of
my
own
failure
in
the
art
which
he
adorned
my
professional
labors
were
finished
i
was
quite
ready
for
miss
hollister
most
searching
inquiries
as
for
the
library
flue
i
had
decided
that
a
little
care
in
piling
the
logs
in
the
hearth
would
obviate
the
possibility
of
any
recurrence
of
the
difficulty
and
i
thereupon
hurried
to
my
room
and
after
a
tub
my
vocation
encouraged
frequent
tubbing
chose
from
the
stable
a
neat
trap
for
one
horse
thus
equipped
i
set
out
to
find
wiggins
the
prescott
arms
is
an
inn
that
sprang
into
being
with
the
advent
of
motoring
the
tourist
is
advised
of
his
approach
to
it
by
signs
swung
at
the
crossways
and
its
plaster
and
timber
walls
are
in
plain
sight
from
one
of
the
excellent
state
roads
gasoline
and
other
liquids
are
offered
there
one
may
have
tea
or
an
ampler
meal
on
short
notice
and
a
few
guests
may
be
lodged
in
case
of
necessity
i
remembered
it
well
having
several
times
found
it
a
haven
on
with
friends
as
i
drove
into
the
entrance
i
saw
wiggins
pacing
the
long
veranda
he
waved
a
hand
and
came
out
to
meet
me
and
when
i
had
rid
myself
of
the
trap
he
suggested
that
we
take
a
walk
illustration
as
i
drove
into
the
entrance
his
manner
was
not
cordial
and
he
wore
the
haggard
look
of
a
man
on
bad
terms
with
his
pillow
i
attributed
his
appearance
to
preoccupation
with
his
when
we
had
withdrawn
a
little
way
from
the
inn
he
turned
on
me
sharply
well
he
demanded
well
i
laughed
oh
you
need
take
that
tone
about
it
your
being
here
is
something
that
requires
explanation
and
your
being
he
flung
out
his
arm
toward
hopefield
manor
your
presence
there
is
not
a
laughing
matter
my
dear
wiggins
i
came
here
in
a
spirit
of
friendship
and
you
treat
me
like
a
pickpocket
i
must
say
that
if
you
had
not
acted
like
a
clam
the
other
night
at
the
club
but
had
told
me
what
was
in
the
wind
we
might
not
be
meeting
now
like
ancient
enemies
instead
of
old
and
intimate
friends
he
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
threw
himself
down
under
a
scarlet
maple
and
began
to
whittle
a
stick
while
i
went
on
with
my
story
i
met
miss
octavia
hollister
in
the
asolando
the
day
after
our
last
dinner
at
the
club
i
had
dropped
into
the
merely
to
look
at
the
place
again
i
had
never
seen
her
before
in
all
my
life
she
is
a
whimsical
old
lady
but
a
lady
you
must
admit
that
and
we
exchanged
cards
on
learning
my
occupation
she
at
once
declared
that
i
must
come
up
here
to
look
at
her
chimneys
she
made
an
appointment
by
mail
for
yesterday
afternoon
it
is
not
my
fault
that
she
treated
me
like
a
guest
or
that
she
introduced
me
of
necessity
to
her
niece
cecilia
and
now
i
have
finished
my
work
and
after
i
have
made
my
report
i
shall
probably
not
meet
her
again
as
for
miss
cecilia
hollister
i
can
only
say
my
dear
wiggins
that
she
is
a
rarely
beautiful
woman
and
that
if
you
wish
to
marry
her
you
have
my
very
best
wishes
for
your
success
and
happiness
it
struck
me
that
you
were
pretty
well
established
there
he
blurted
i
confess
that
i
took
it
for
granted
you
were
not
there
wholly
on
a
professional
errand
and
i
wo
deny
ames
that
i
was
not
pleased
to
see
you
you
honor
me
in
assuming
that
i
might
aspire
to
the
hand
of
so
splendid
a
woman
as
cecilia
hollister
but
my
dear
wiggins
i
tell
you
i
never
laid
eyes
on
her
until
last
night
but
you
had
been
to
the
asolando
he
persisted
hacking
away
doggedly
at
his
stick
of
course
i
had
i
told
you
i
had
i
told
you
the
whole
story
but
i
did
not
see
cecilia
hollister
there
she
was
there
i
fancy
that
after
you
saw
her
there
last
spring
and
became
infatuated
with
her
and
followed
her
to
europe
instead
of
going
to
dakota
to
harvest
your
blooming
wheat
after
that
bit
of
history
she
never
returned
to
the
asolando
your
lack
of
frankness
in
all
this
has
pained
me
and
you
left
it
for
a
gossiping
chap
like
jewett
to
tell
me
the
whole
story
and
to
cap
your
duplicity
you
sneaked
out
of
the
club
the
other
night
while
jewett
was
talking
to
me
and
let
the
club
people
think
you
were
bound
for
your
ranch
i
call
it
rather
low
down
wiggins
after
all
the
years
we
have
known
each
other
my
slate
is
clean
how
about
yours
he
threw
the
stick
at
a
sparrow
whose
chirp
irritated
him
from
a
stone
fence
beyond
us
and
turned
toward
me
a
countenance
on
which
dejection
humiliation
and
chagrin
were
written
large
damn
it
all
he
bellowed
i
believe
i
losing
my
mind
i
know
what
i
doing
that
old
woman
up
there
is
responsible
for
all
this
she
as
crazy
as
a
march
hare
crazier
and
she
made
a
prisoner
of
that
girl
i
tell
you
cecilia
hollister
is
the
grandest
girl
in
the
world
go
it
son
those
descendants
of
cæsar
legions
at
work
in
the
road
down
there
are
pausing
to
listen
try
to
affect
calmness
if
you
feel
it
i
agree
to
all
you
say
of
miss
cecilia
and
please
get
it
into
your
noddle
that
i
have
no
intention
of
becoming
your
rival
for
her
hand
but
i
must
beg
of
you
also
not
to
speak
in
such
terms
of
her
aunt
she
the
most
delightful
woman
i
ever
met
mad
i
tell
you
quite
mad
wise
with
the
most
beautiful
wisdom
you
simply
do
understand
her
i
know
all
i
want
to
about
her
if
she
were
not
insane
she
would
not
build
a
wall
of
mystery
about
her
niece
and
keep
me
camping
out
here
not
knowing
where
i
stand
i
tell
you
ames
that
woman
is
a
malevolent
being
she
perfectly
fiendish
there
is
no
way
of
answering
a
man
in
this
humor
save
by
laughter
and
i
laughed
long
and
loud
to
the
consternation
of
the
italian
who
were
now
swallowing
their
luncheons
a
short
distance
away
from
us
wiggins
sulked
awhile
and
then
addressed
me
seriously
i
did
tell
you
i
was
going
abroad
because
the
situation
made
explanations
difficult
i
could
hardly
tell
you
that
i
was
about
to
race
over
europe
after
a
waitress
i
had
seen
in
a
you
always
so
confoundedly
suspicious
it
would
have
an
odd
sound
even
now
if
she
were
well
if
she
were
a
waitress
instead
of
what
you
know
her
to
be
and
my
animosity
toward
miss
octavia
hollister
is
due
to
the
fact
that
after
i
had
been
as
courteous
to
her
all
summer
long
as
i
could
and
thought
myself
tolerably
established
in
her
mind
as
a
decent
person
and
a
gentleman
she
suddenly
shuts
cecilia
up
in
that
house
bought
it
on
purpose
i
fancy
and
cecilia
herself
is
compelled
to
take
on
an
air
of
mystery
warning
me
to
keep
away
suggesting
the
darkest
possibilities
but
giving
me
no
hint
whatever
of
the
reason
for
her
conduct
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
miss
octavia
for
a
moment
while
you
were
acting
as
cavalier
to
her
party
abroad
she
was
friendly
then
she
suddenly
changed
now
there
must
be
some
explanation
of
that
well
for
one
thing
she
flew
off
at
a
tangent
about
my
ancestors
we
were
in
berlin
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
got
to
talking
about
the
american
revolution
she
asked
me
what
my
people
had
done
for
the
patriotic
cause
the
painful
fact
is
that
most
of
them
were
tories
but
my
broke
with
his
father
and
brothers
joined
washington
army
and
fought
through
the
whole
business
but
to
save
the
feelings
of
the
rest
of
them
who
went
to
england
till
it
was
all
over
he
changed
his
name
there
no
mention
of
him
in
the
war
records
anywhere
i
had
experts
working
on
it
but
they
ca
find
any
trace
of
him
he
was
greatly
embittered
by
the
estrangement
from
his
people
and
though
he
had
a
farm
in
this
very
neighborhood
somewhere
i
thought
sometime
i
look
it
up
and
try
to
get
hold
of
it
he
never
mentioned
his
military
experiences
even
to
his
own
children
usually
miss
hollister
changes
front
if
you
give
her
time
i
heard
her
say
that
we
have
been
better
off
if
we
never
broken
with
england
but
she
persists
in
prodding
that
weak
place
in
my
armor
that
very
dark
wiggy
if
she
keeps
it
up
you
have
to
dig
up
your
someway
the
spiritualists
might
call
him
on
long
distance
but
let
us
turn
to
miss
cecilia
i
do
for
a
moment
believe
that
she
is
a
victim
of
ancestor
worship
the
perambulator
rampant
adorns
the
hollister
shield
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
from
what
you
say
cecilia
has
not
repelled
you
on
the
other
hand
she
has
frankly
given
you
to
understand
that
you
must
not
press
your
suit
at
this
time
for
reasons
she
sees
fit
to
withhold
a
little
more
patience
a
little
calm
deliberation
and
less
violent
language
and
in
due
course
the
girl
is
yours
now
what
do
you
fancy
is
the
cause
of
cecilia
abrupt
change
of
attitude
he
refused
to
meet
my
eyes
but
turned
away
as
though
to
conceal
an
embarrassment
whose
cause
i
could
not
surmise
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
husky
with
emotion
am
i
a
cad
am
i
beneath
the
contempt
of
decent
people
it
possible
wiggy
that
you
are
go
on
with
it
well
you
know
he
began
diffidently
cecilia
has
a
sister
i
grinned
but
his
scowl
brought
me
to
myself
again
yes
and
her
name
is
hezekiah
the
name
pleases
me
she
was
with
miss
octavia
in
her
gallop
over
europe
so
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
her
necessarily
she
is
younger
than
cecilia
she
a
good
deal
of
a
kid
the
sort
that
never
grows
up
you
know
just
like
her
aunt
octavia
bah
do
mention
that
woman
hezekiah
is
a
very
pretty
girl
and
i
suppose
well
when
you
are
thrown
with
a
girl
that
way
seeing
her
constantly
i
clapped
my
hand
on
his
knee
as
the
light
began
to
dawn
upon
me
you
old
rascal
you
do
need
to
add
a
single
word
i
dare
say
you
are
guilty
i
can
see
it
in
your
eye
after
waiting
till
you
reached
years
of
discretion
before
beginning
an
attack
upon
womankind
you
began
mowing
them
down
in
platoons
so
they
come
running
now
that
you
got
a
start
oh
wiggy
and
i
believed
you
immune
and
you
trying
to
drive
tandem
the
thing
was
funny
knowing
wiggins
as
i
did
and
i
gave
expression
to
my
mirth
but
his
fierce
demeanor
quickly
brought
me
back
to
the
serious
contemplation
of
his
difficulty
that
you
shameless
wretch
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
miss
octavia
aloofness
your
dealing
with
her
nieces
you
confirm
my
impression
that
she
is
a
wise
woman
and
cecilia
i
take
it
may
be
deeply
embarrassed
by
her
sister
infatuation
for
you
you
certainly
have
made
a
tangle
of
things
you
you
conscienceless
deceiver
but
where
may
i
ask
does
this
hezekiah
keep
herself
oh
she
with
her
father
they
have
a
bungalow
over
the
hills
there
several
miles
from
hopefield
manor
well
i
hope
you
are
no
longer
toying
with
her
affections
of
course
you
do
see
her
any
more
well
he
mumbled
i
did
see
her
this
morning
but
i
could
help
it
it
was
the
merest
chance
i
met
her
in
the
road
when
i
was
out
taking
a
walk
she
always
turning
up
she
the
most
unaccountable
young
person
i
suppose
wiggy
that
if
you
stand
in
the
road
and
miss
hezekiah
hollister
strolls
by
on
her
way
to
market
you
fancy
that
she
is
pursuing
you
as
miss
octavia
has
well
said
this
is
not
a
chivalrous
age
i
deeply
disappointed
in
you
your
conduct
and
your
attitude
toward
this
trusting
young
girl
are
disgraceful
he
rose
and
flung
up
his
arms
despairingly
it
was
much
easier
to
laugh
at
wiggins
than
to
be
angry
at
him
but
i
recalled
the
message
which
cecilia
had
entrusted
to
me
and
this
i
thought
might
give
him
some
comfort
miss
cecilia
asked
me
this
morning
to
say
to
you
that
you
must
not
try
to
see
her
again
you
must
keep
away
from
the
house
this
obviously
increased
his
dejection
but
i
added
i
was
to
say
that
she
thought
nothing
had
yet
occurred
to
interfere
with
your
ambitions
as
you
were
not
permitted
to
see
her
alone
last
night
the
chimney
you
may
remember
began
playing
pranks
just
at
the
moment
when
miss
hollister
and
i
were
about
to
adjourn
to
the
so
a
between
you
and
cecilia
was
impossible
she
told
you
to
see
me
she
certainly
did
i
confess
that
my
message
does
seem
luminous
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
meant
to
be
kind
it
may
be
that
she
is
giving
you
time
to
disentangle
yourself
from
the
delectable
meshes
i
ca
elucidate
i
merely
convey
information
but
answer
honestly
if
you
can
has
cecilia
ever
by
word
or
act
refused
you
no
he
replied
grimly
she
never
given
me
the
chance
he
asked
me
to
luncheon
and
on
the
way
back
to
the
inn
after
inquiring
my
plans
for
returning
to
town
he
proposed
that
i
delay
my
departure
until
the
following
day
what
he
wanted
and
he
put
it
bluntly
was
a
friend
at
court
and
as
i
had
seemingly
satisfied
him
of
my
entire
good
faith
and
of
my
devotion
to
his
interests
he
begged
that
i
prolong
my
stay
in
miss
hollister
house
giving
as
my
excuse
the
condition
of
the
chimneys
of
hopefield
manor
he
brushed
aside
my
plea
of
other
engagements
and
appealed
to
our
old
friendship
he
was
taking
his
troubles
hard
and
i
felt
that
he
really
needed
counsel
and
support
in
the
involved
state
of
his
affairs
i
did
not
see
how
my
continued
presence
under
miss
hollister
roof
could
materially
assist
him
and
the
thought
of
remaining
there
when
there
was
no
work
to
be
done
was
repugnant
to
my
sense
of
professional
honor
but
he
was
so
persistent
that
i
finally
yielded
while
we
ate
luncheon
i
sought
by
every
means
to
divert
his
thoughts
to
other
channels
after
we
were
seated
in
the
four
other
men
followed
exercising
considerable
care
in
placing
themselves
as
far
from
one
another
as
possible
a
few
moments
later
a
motor
hummed
into
the
driveway
and
we
heard
its
owner
ordering
his
chauffeur
to
return
to
town
and
hold
himself
subject
to
telephone
call
this
latest
arrival
appeared
shortly
in
the
and
surveying
the
rest
of
us
with
a
disdainful
air
sought
a
table
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
room
others
appeared
until
eight
in
all
had
entered
the
presence
of
these
men
at
this
hour
their
air
of
aloofness
and
the
care
they
exercised
in
isolating
themselves
interested
me
they
appeared
to
be
gentlemen
they
were
indeed
suggestive
of
the
ampler
metropolitan
world
and
one
of
them
was
unmistakably
a
foreigner
while
wiggins
appeared
to
ignore
them
i
was
conscious
that
he
reviewed
the
successive
arrivals
with
every
manifestation
of
contempt
one
of
these
glum
gentlemen
seemed
familiar
i
could
not
at
once
recall
him
but
something
in
his
manner
teased
my
memory
for
a
moment
before
i
placed
him
then
it
dawned
upon
me
that
he
was
the
third
man
i
had
met
in
the
field
overhanging
the
garden
after
my
eavesdropping
experience
the
day
before
i
thought
it
as
well
however
not
to
mention
this
fact
or
to
speak
of
the
man
i
had
seen
so
grimly
posted
in
the
midst
of
the
cornfield
i
was
an
observer
a
at
hopefield
and
my
immediate
business
was
the
collecting
of
information
will
you
kindly
tell
me
wiggy
who
these
strange
gentlemen
are
and
just
what
has
brought
them
here
at
this
hour
they
seem
greatly
preoccupied
and
the
last
one
in
particular
surveyed
you
with
a
murderous
eye
if
we
could
be
translated
to
some
such
inn
as
this
in
the
environs
of
paris
i
should
conclude
that
a
duel
was
imminent
and
that
these
gentlemen
were
assembling
to
meet
after
their
coffee
morning
for
an
affair
of
honor
i
know
them
they
are
guests
of
the
inn
most
of
them
were
more
or
less
companions
in
our
procession
across
europe
last
summer
the
one
in
the
tan
suit
is
henderson
you
must
have
heard
of
him
the
short
dark
chap
of
atrabilous
countenance
is
john
stewart
dick
who
pretends
to
be
a
philosopher
as
for
the
others
he
dismissed
them
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
my
wits
struggled
with
his
explanation
it
is
my
way
to
wish
to
reduce
information
to
plain
terms
are
these
gentlemen
then
your
rivals
for
the
hand
of
miss
cecilia
hollister
if
so
they
are
a
solemn
band
of
suitors
i
must
confess
you
have
hit
it
ames
they
are
suitors
assembled
from
all
parts
of
the
world
fellows
except
the
chap
with
the
monocle
who
has
just
ordered
rather
more
liquor
than
a
gentleman
should
drink
at
this
hour
that
is
lord
arrowood
i
have
feared
at
times
that
miss
octavia
favored
him
possibly
but
not
likely
but
how
long
is
this
thing
going
to
last
if
you
fellows
are
going
to
hang
on
here
until
miss
cecilia
hollister
has
chosen
one
of
you
for
her
husband
i
shudder
for
your
nerves
i
imagine
that
any
one
of
these
gentlemen
is
likely
to
begin
shooting
across
his
plate
at
any
minute
such
a
situation
would
become
intolerable
very
quickly
if
i
were
in
the
game
and
forced
to
lodge
here
i
hope
replied
wiggins
with
heat
that
you
do
imagine
these
fellows
can
crowd
me
out
i
paid
for
a
month
lodging
in
advance
and
if
you
will
stand
by
me
i
going
to
win
spoken
like
a
man
my
dear
wiggins
you
may
count
on
me
to
the
sweet
or
bitter
end
even
if
i
pull
down
all
the
superb
chimneys
with
which
pepperton
adorned
that
house
up
yonder
he
silently
clasped
my
hand
a
little
later
i
telephoned
from
the
inn
to
my
office
explaining
my
absence
and
instructing
my
assistant
to
visit
several
pressing
clients
and
i
instructed
the
valet
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
to
send
me
a
week
supply
of
linen
and
an
odd
suit
or
two
at
about
three
i
left
wiggins
in
spirits
and
set
out
on
my
return
to
hopefield
manor
i
felt
the
eyes
of
the
eight
other
suitors
who
were
scattered
at
intervals
along
the
verandah
glued
to
my
back
as
i
drove
out
of
the
inn
yard
vii
nine
silk
hats
cross
a
stile
a
girl
in
a
white
sweater
sat
on
a
stone
wall
and
munched
a
red
apple
but
this
is
to
anticipate
i
had
made
a
wrong
turn
on
leaving
the
prescott
arms
and
i
came
out
presently
near
katonah
village
i
got
my
bearings
of
a
shopkeeper
and
started
again
for
hopefield
manor
but
the
was
warm
and
the
hills
were
steep
and
as
miss
hollister
admirable
cob
showed
signs
of
weariness
i
drove
into
a
and
loosened
the
check
on
a
sunny
slope
several
hundred
yards
above
the
highway
lay
an
orchard
advertised
to
the
larcenous
eye
by
the
ruddiest
of
red
apples
not
in
many
years
had
i
robbed
an
orchard
and
i
felt
irresistibly
drawn
toward
the
gnarled
trees
which
were
still
in
their
old
age
abundantly
fruitful
when
i
reached
the
orchard
i
found
it
quite
isolated
with
only
fallow
fields
seamed
with
stone
fences
stretching
on
either
hand
a
spring
near
by
sent
the
slenderest
of
brooks
flashing
down
the
slope
there
was
no
house
in
sight
anywhere
and
the
neglected
orchard
flaunted
its
bright
fruit
with
pathetic
bravado
i
drew
down
a
bough
and
plucked
my
first
apple
tasted
and
found
it
good
at
my
palate
first
responsive
titillation
something
whizzed
past
my
ear
and
following
the
flight
of
the
missile
i
saw
an
apple
of
goodly
size
fall
and
roll
away
into
the
grass
i
had
imagined
myself
utterly
alone
and
even
now
as
i
looked
guiltily
around
no
one
was
in
sight
the
apple
had
passed
my
ear
swiftly
and
at
an
angle
quite
it
had
been
fairly
aimed
at
my
head
and
the
law
of
gravitation
did
not
account
for
it
as
i
continued
my
scrutiny
of
the
landscape
i
was
addressed
by
a
voice
whose
accents
were
not
objurgatory
rather
the
tone
was
and
indulgent
if
not
indeed
a
trifle
patronizing
the
words
were
these
soup
of
the
evening
beautiful
soup
it
was
then
that
lifting
my
eyes
i
beheld
sitting
lengthwise
of
the
wall
with
her
feet
drawn
comfortably
under
her
a
girl
in
a
white
sweater
bareheaded
munching
an
apple
there
was
no
question
of
identity
it
was
the
girl
whose
head
behind
the
cashier
grill
of
the
asolando
had
interested
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
second
visit
to
the
in
soliciting
my
attention
by
reciting
a
line
of
verse
she
had
merely
followed
the
rule
of
the
in
like
circumstances
the
casting
of
the
apple
at
my
head
possessed
the
virtue
of
novelty
but
now
that
her
shot
was
fired
and
her
line
spoken
she
addressed
herself
again
to
her
apple
her
manner
implied
indifference
but
her
unconcern
was
that
of
a
trout
not
wishing
to
discourage
the
fisherman
feigning
a
languid
interest
in
a
familiar
fly
dropped
at
its
nose
while
i
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
i
pecked
at
my
own
apple
but
kept
an
eye
on
her
she
concluded
her
repast
calmly
and
flung
away
the
core
i
mentioned
soup
she
remarked
the
courses
are
mixed
we
have
partaken
of
fruit
are
you
fish
flesh
fowl
or
good
red
herring
daughter
of
eve
i
will
be
anything
you
like
i
obliged
for
the
apple
and
i
apologize
for
having
entered
eden
uninvited
it
not
my
eden
nobody
invited
me
but
it
not
too
much
to
say
that
these
apples
are
grand
i
glad
we
both
in
the
same
boat
i
a
trespasser
myself
i
do
even
know
the
name
of
the
owner
but
if
you
have
had
only
one
apple
two
more
are
coming
to
you
if
you
follow
atalanta
precedent
i
do
follow
precedents
and
i
forgotten
the
name
of
the
boy
who
threw
the
apples
in
the
race
it
does
matter
though
nothing
matters
very
much
her
hands
clasped
her
knees
her
skirt
was
short
and
i
was
conscious
that
she
wore
tan
shoes
she
continued
to
regard
me
with
lazy
curiosity
she
seemed
younger
than
at
the
asolando
not
more
than
eighteen
times
had
apples
reddened
on
the
bough
in
her
lifetime
she
was
even
slenderer
and
more
youthful
in
her
sweater
than
in
the
snowy
vestments
of
the
asolando
her
hair
which
in
the
glow
of
the
lamp
at
asolando
had
been
golden
was
burnished
copper
and
was
brushed
straight
back
from
her
forehead
and
tied
with
a
black
ribbon
i
quite
agree
with
your
philosophy
nothing
is
of
great
importance
so
it
not
your
orchard
she
asked
the
thought
flatters
me
i
own
no
lands
nor
ships
at
sea
i
a
chimney
doctor
and
if
necessary
i
apologize
for
it
you
need
submit
testimonials
i
take
the
swallows
out
of
my
own
chimneys
that
requires
a
deft
hand
and
i
sure
you
considerate
of
the
swallows
you
may
come
up
here
and
sit
on
the
wall
if
you
care
to
i
saw
you
driving
in
a
trap
i
hope
your
horse
is
afraid
of
motors
motors
speed
scandalously
on
that
road
i
am
not
in
the
least
worried
about
my
horse
it
borrowed
as
you
remarked
this
is
a
nice
orchard
i
like
it
here
if
you
are
going
to
be
silly
you
will
find
me
little
inclined
to
nonsense
shall
we
talk
of
the
asolando
i
have
been
back
since
i
saw
you
there
and
yet
let
me
see
is
this
your
day
there
she
seemed
greatly
amused
and
her
laughter
rose
with
a
spontaneity
and
fell
a
splash
of
musical
sound
on
the
mellow
air
of
the
orchard
she
had
changed
her
position
as
i
joined
her
sitting
erect
and
kicking
her
heels
lazily
against
the
wall
chimney
man
something
terrible
happened
just
after
you
left
that
afternoon
i
was
bounced
fired
i
lost
my
job
incredible
i
sure
it
was
not
for
any
good
cause
i
can
testify
that
you
were
a
model
of
attention
you
were
surpassingly
discreet
you
repelled
me
in
the
most
delicate
manner
when
i
intimated
that
i
should
come
often
on
the
days
that
you
made
the
change
the
sad
part
of
it
was
that
that
was
not
only
my
last
day
but
my
first
i
had
never
been
there
before
except
for
a
nibble
now
and
then
when
i
was
in
town
but
i
could
stand
it
it
was
like
being
in
jail
in
fact
i
think
jail
would
be
preferable
but
i
glad
i
spent
that
one
day
there
it
proved
what
i
have
long
believed
that
i
am
a
barbarian
that
poetry
on
the
walls
of
the
asolando
made
me
tired
not
that
it
is
good
poetry
but
that
the
walls
of
a
are
no
place
for
it
i
always
suspect
that
people
who
like
their
poetry
framed
and
who
have
uplift
mottoes
stuck
in
mirrors
where
they
can
study
them
while
they
brush
their
hair
in
the
morning
never
really
get
any
poetry
inside
of
them
you
need
a
place
like
this
for
poetry
an
old
orchard
with
blue
sky
and
a
crumbly
wall
to
sit
on
i
tried
the
asolando
as
a
lark
really
not
because
i
deeply
entertained
by
that
sort
of
thing
they
dispensed
with
my
company
because
i
remarked
to
one
of
the
silly
girls
who
are
making
the
asolando
their
that
i
thought
the
english
had
carried
the
rather
too
far
the
girl
to
whom
i
uttered
this
heresy
was
so
shocked
she
dropped
a
you
know
how
brittle
everything
is
in
there
and
i
came
home
you
were
really
the
only
adventure
i
got
out
of
my
day
there
and
i
did
find
you
entirely
satisfactory
thank
you
francesca
for
these
confidences
and
having
lost
your
position
you
are
now
free
to
roam
the
hills
and
dream
on
orchard
walls
your
scheme
of
life
is
to
my
liking
i
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
you
were
born
for
the
open
and
that
the
walls
of
no
can
ever
hold
you
again
she
nodded
a
dreamy
acquiescence
then
she
turned
two
very
brown
eyes
full
upon
me
and
demanded
what
is
your
name
please
i
mentioned
it
and
you
doctor
chimneys
that
sounds
very
amusing
i
glad
you
like
it
most
people
think
it
absurd
what
are
you
doing
here
there
not
a
chimney
in
sight
oh
i
have
a
commission
in
the
neighborhood
hopefield
manor
you
may
have
heard
of
miss
hollister
place
of
course
every
one
knows
of
her
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
was
she
about
whom
you
asked
in
the
asolando
that
afternoon
you
wanted
to
know
what
she
said
about
the
i
remember
perfectly
she
was
quiet
for
a
moment
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
that
rare
laugh
of
hers
you
might
let
me
into
the
joke
it
would
mean
anything
to
you
i
have
a
lot
of
private
jokes
that
are
for
my
own
consumption
your
way
of
laughing
is
adorable
i
hope
to
hear
more
of
it
in
the
asolando
you
repulsed
me
in
a
manner
that
won
my
admiration
but
i
venture
to
say
now
that
if
you
roam
these
pastures
i
am
the
grass
beneath
your
feet
and
if
yonder
tuneful
water
be
sacred
to
you
i
sit
beside
the
brook
to
learn
its
song
you
talk
well
sir
but
from
your
tone
i
fear
you
ca
forget
that
we
met
first
in
the
asolando
that
day
of
my
life
is
past
and
i
am
by
no
means
what
you
might
call
an
asolandad
i
do
seem
to
impress
you
with
that
fact
i
a
human
being
not
to
be
picked
like
a
red
apple
or
trampled
upon
like
grass
or
listened
to
as
though
i
were
a
foolish
little
brook
i
greatly
given
to
the
highway
and
i
prefer
macadam
i
like
asphalt
pavements
too
for
the
matter
of
that
i
should
love
a
motor
but
lacking
the
coin
i
pedal
a
bicycle
my
wheel
lies
down
there
in
the
bushes
you
see
chimney
man
i
am
a
person
and
have
no
intention
of
deceiving
you
my
name
was
francesca
for
one
day
only
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
my
real
name
is
hezekiah
hezekiah
i
must
have
shouted
it
she
seemed
startled
by
my
violence
you
have
pronounced
it
correctly
she
remarked
then
you
are
cecilia
sister
and
miss
hollister
niece
guilty
and
you
live
over
there
somewhere
beyond
that
ridge
and
she
waved
her
hand
vaguely
toward
the
village
and
laughed
again
pray
tell
me
what
this
particular
joke
is
it
must
be
immensely
funny
i
urged
struggling
with
these
new
facts
oh
it
aunt
octavia
she
will
be
the
death
of
me
yet
you
know
the
girl
who
waited
on
aunt
octavia
that
afternoon
took
all
that
artistic
nonsense
as
seriously
as
a
funeral
and
she
told
me
after
you
left
with
the
greatest
horror
that
aunt
octavia
had
asked
for
a
cocktail
that
laugh
rippled
off
again
to
carry
joy
along
the
above
us
but
you
know
she
resumed
that
aunt
octavia
never
drank
a
cocktail
in
her
life
and
would
she
does
know
a
cocktail
from
soothing
syrup
she
pines
for
adventures
she
is
just
like
a
girl
who
has
read
her
first
romance
of
the
young
american
engineer
in
a
south
american
republic
shooting
the
insurgents
full
of
tortillas
and
marrying
the
president
daughter
she
reads
pirate
books
and
is
crazy
about
buried
chests
and
pieces
of
eight
and
they
say
i
just
like
her
she
is
the
most
perfectly
killing
person
in
the
world
hezekiah
laughed
again
so
this
was
the
child
whose
devotion
had
rendered
wiggins
so
miserable
and
the
sister
of
whom
cecilia
hollister
and
her
aunt
had
spoken
so
strangely
i
had
not
suspected
it
she
was
as
unlike
cecilia
as
possible
and
the
difference
lay
in
her
independent
spirit
and
bubbling
humor
her
individuality
was
more
pronounced
you
took
her
without
debate
on
her
own
ground
and
though
she
had
expressed
a
preference
for
macadam
she
seemed
related
to
the
days
when
maidens
sat
on
sunny
walls
and
were
not
disappointed
in
their
expectation
that
youths
or
mayhap
winged
sons
of
the
olympians
would
reward
patient
waiting
but
at
the
same
time
she
struck
the
note
of
modernity
her
flings
at
the
asolando
were
reassuring
she
was
a
vigorous
young
woman
whose
nature
protested
against
affectation
and
pose
she
rebelled
against
closed
doors
whether
those
of
town
or
country
i
am
myself
much
of
a
cockney
and
not
averse
to
asphalt
and
streets
ablaze
with
electric
banners
my
imagination
sprang
to
meet
this
hezekiah
i
had
in
fact
a
feeling
that
i
had
waited
for
her
somewhere
in
some
earlier
incarnation
she
jumped
down
from
the
wall
shook
three
apples
from
a
tree
and
sustained
them
in
the
air
with
the
deftness
and
certainty
of
practised
her
absorption
was
complete
and
when
she
wearied
of
this
sport
she
flung
the
apples
away
one
after
the
other
with
a
boy
free
swing
of
the
arm
herrick
would
have
delighted
in
her
dobson
would
have
spun
her
bright
hair
into
a
rondeau
but
only
aldrich
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
could
have
brought
her
up
to
date
in
a
dozen
chiming
couplets
i
felt
that
no
matter
how
much
one
admired
and
respected
this
hezekiah
one
would
never
deal
with
her
in
the
phrases
of
her
charming
inadvertences
made
this
impossible
and
it
was
the
part
of
discretion
to
await
her
own
initiative
she
had
gone
on
up
to
the
crest
of
the
orchard
and
stood
clearly
limned
against
the
sky
her
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
her
sweater
she
appeared
to
be
intent
upon
something
that
lay
beyond
and
half
turned
her
head
and
summoned
me
by
whistling
i
liked
this
better
than
the
quotation
method
of
address
it
was
a
clear
shrill
pipe
that
whistle
and
she
emphasized
it
further
by
a
peremptory
wave
of
her
arm
when
i
stood
beside
her
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
site
commanded
a
wide
area
including
the
unmistakable
roofs
and
chimneys
of
hopefield
manor
half
a
mile
distant
illustration
she
emphasized
it
further
by
a
peremptory
wave
of
her
arm
you
will
see
something
funny
down
there
in
a
minute
they
are
out
of
sight
now
but
there
a
stile
the
kind
with
steps
just
beyond
those
trees
it
in
a
path
that
leads
from
the
prescott
arms
to
aunt
octavia
look
my
eyes
discovered
the
stile
it
was
set
in
a
wall
that
was
she
told
me
the
boundary
dividing
hopefield
manor
from
another
estate
nearer
our
position
suddenly
a
silk
hat
bobbed
in
the
path
beyond
the
stile
it
rose
as
its
owner
mounted
the
steps
it
paused
an
instant
when
the
top
of
the
stile
was
reached
then
quickly
descended
and
came
toward
us
a
black
blot
above
a
black
coat
i
was
about
to
ask
her
the
meaning
of
this
apparition
when
a
second
silk
hat
bobbed
in
the
path
and
then
rose
like
its
predecessor
descending
and
keeping
on
its
way
until
hidden
from
our
sight
by
shrubbery
a
third
fourth
fifth
sixth
seventh
eighth
and
ninth
followed
nine
gentlemen
in
silk
hats
crossing
a
stile
in
a
lonely
pasture
between
woodlands
so
much
was
plain
to
the
eye
from
our
but
i
groped
blindly
for
an
explanation
of
this
spectacle
the
bobbing
hats
and
dark
coats
suggested
wanderers
from
some
dark
plutonian
cave
bent
upon
mischief
to
the
upper
world
their
step
was
jaunty
they
moved
as
though
drilled
to
the
same
cadence
we
waited
a
moment
expecting
that
another
figure
might
join
the
strange
procession
but
nine
was
the
correct
count
i
looked
down
to
find
hezekiah
checking
them
off
on
the
fingers
of
her
slim
brown
hand
has
there
been
a
funeral
and
are
they
the
returning
i
inquired
not
yet
she
replied
her
face
showed
amusement
the
twitching
of
her
lips
encouraged
hope
that
another
of
those
delightful
laughs
was
imminent
it
was
positively
weird
i
said
it
reminds
me
of
a
dream
i
used
to
have
when
i
was
a
boy
of
a
long
line
of
chinamen
running
along
the
top
of
a
great
wall
an
interminable
procession
i
must
have
dreamed
that
dream
a
hundred
times
i
could
hear
the
pigtails
of
those
fellows
flapping
against
their
backs
as
they
trotted
along
and
the
soft
scraping
of
their
sandals
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
wall
but
the
pot
hats
are
equally
eerie
and
unaccountable
to
my
dull
senses
pray
tell
me
the
answer
hezekiah
oh
those
are
cecilia
suitors
they
been
to
aunt
octavia
to
tea
they
staying
at
the
prescott
arms
probably
they
terribly
formal
i
ca
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
sombreness
created
by
those
fellows
you
hardly
expect
them
to
tramp
cross
country
in
those
duds
such
grandeur
should
go
on
wheels
oh
they
are
afraid
of
aunt
octavia
she
wo
allow
a
motor
on
her
grounds
and
i
suppose
they
afraid
they
might
break
some
other
rule
if
they
went
on
any
kind
of
wheels
she
rather
exacting
you
know
my
aunt
octavia
i
was
at
the
prescott
for
luncheon
and
i
must
have
seen
these
gentlemen
there
oh
were
at
the
prescott
almost
for
the
first
time
her
manner
betrayed
surprise
but
mischief
danced
in
the
brown
eyes
with
wiggins
confession
as
to
the
havoc
he
had
played
with
hezekiah
confiding
heart
fresh
in
my
memory
i
felt
a
delicacy
about
telling
her
that
it
was
to
see
wiggins
that
i
had
visited
the
inn
but
to
my
surprise
she
introduced
the
subject
of
wiggins
immediately
and
with
laughter
struggling
for
one
of
those
splashes
that
were
so
beguiling
oh
wiggy
is
staying
there
do
you
know
wiggy
know
wiggy
hezekiah
i
know
no
man
better
wiggy
is
no
end
of
fun
is
he
i
heard
him
speak
of
you
you
are
his
friend
the
chimney
man
he
was
the
last
man
over
the
stile
did
you
notice
that
he
lingered
a
moment
longer
at
the
top
than
the
others
from
his
being
the
ninth
man
i
imagine
that
he
was
the
last
to
leave
the
house
and
he
probably
felt
that
this
set
him
apart
from
the
others
wiggy
is
nothing
if
not
shy
and
retiring
a
girl
did
not
speak
here
she
whistled
softly
to
herself
as
we
descended
the
air
was
cooling
rapidly
and
the
west
was
hung
in
scarlet
and
purple
and
gold
the
horse
neighed
in
the
road
below
and
i
knew
that
i
must
be
on
my
way
to
the
manor
hezekiah
i
said
when
i
had
drawn
her
bicycle
from
its
you
better
leave
your
wheel
here
and
let
me
drive
you
home
late
and
there
frost
in
the
air
i
imagine
it
some
distance
to
your
house
thank
you
chimney
man
but
it
is
much
farther
to
aunt
octavia
for
you
have
to
make
a
long
circuit
around
the
hills
and
besides
as
we
met
in
the
orchard
it
would
be
altogether
too
commonplace
a
conclusion
of
our
adventure
for
you
to
drive
me
home
behind
a
mere
horse
but
tell
me
this
what
do
you
think
of
wiggy
chances
of
winning
your
sister
i
should
say
from
my
knowledge
of
wiggins
that
he
is
a
man
much
given
to
staying
in
a
game
once
the
cards
are
shuffled
she
nodded
standing
beside
her
wheel
her
hands
on
the
bars
her
manner
was
contemplative
her
eyes
for
a
moment
were
deep
shadowless
pools
of
reverie
then
you
think
he
knows
the
game
there
seemed
to
be
something
beneath
the
surface
meaning
of
her
words
but
i
answered
wiggy
affairs
have
been
few
and
while
he
may
not
know
the
game
in
all
its
intricacies
he
has
a
shrewd
if
rather
slow
mind
and
besides
he
has
asked
my
help
in
the
matter
one
of
these
situations
then
well
i
should
say
chimney
man
i
should
say
she
made
ready
for
flight
looking
ahead
to
be
sure
of
a
clear
thoroughfare
i
should
say
she
concluded
settling
her
skirts
that
that
indicates
considerable
intelligence
on
wiggy
part
the
tires
rolled
smoothly
away
the
gravel
crunching
the
pebbles
popping
the
white
sweater
clasped
a
straight
back
snugly
then
suddenly
as
the
wheels
gained
momentum
she
bent
low
for
a
spurt
and
her
rapidly
receding
figure
became
a
gray
blur
in
the
purple
dusk
viii
cecilia
silver
miss
octavia
was
in
the
gayest
spirits
at
dinner
that
night
and
struck
afield
at
once
with
one
of
her
amusing
dicta
human
beings
she
said
may
be
divided
into
two
groups
interesting
and
uninteresting
but
idiots
abound
in
both
classes
cecilia
and
i
discussed
this
with
more
or
less
gravity
until
we
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
miss
octavia
following
with
apparent
interest
and
setting
us
off
at
a
new
tangent
when
our
enthusiasm
lagged
she
referred
in
no
way
whatever
to
her
chimneys
nor
did
she
ask
me
how
i
had
spent
the
day
i
felt
the
pleading
of
cecilia
eyes
that
i
should
accept
the
situation
as
it
stood
and
having
already
agreed
to
wiggins
suggestion
that
i
abide
in
miss
hollister
house
as
a
spy
for
this
was
the
ignoble
fact
i
felt
the
threads
of
conspiracy
binding
me
fast
so
far
as
my
hostess
was
concerned
i
was
now
less
a
guest
than
a
member
of
the
household
the
variety
of
subjects
that
miss
octavia
suggested
was
amazing
from
aeronautics
to
the
negro
question
from
polar
exploration
to
the
political
conditions
in
bulgaria
she
passed
with
the
jauntiest
insouciance
and
apparently
with
a
considerable
fund
of
information
to
support
her
positions
she
knew
many
people
in
all
walks
of
life
i
remember
that
she
spoke
with
the
greatest
freedom
of
the
governor
of
indiana
whom
she
had
met
on
a
railway
journey
she
quoted
this
gentleman
utterances
with
keenest
zest
his
anecdotal
range
she
declared
to
be
the
widest
and
raciest
she
had
ever
encountered
in
a
considerable
acquaintance
with
public
characters
she
thought
the
hoosier
statesman
eminently
fitted
by
reason
of
his
acute
sense
of
humor
for
the
office
of
president
that
man
said
miss
octavia
was
splendidly
equipped
for
handling
the
most
perplexing
affairs
of
state
it
seemed
absurd
that
his
public
services
should
be
limited
to
the
petty
business
of
a
commonwealth
whose
chief
products
are
pawpaws
persimmons
and
politics
the
governor
told
me
that
before
his
election
he
had
been
sorely
beset
by
reformers
they
had
teased
him
persistently
to
express
his
views
on
the
most
absurd
questions
they
wanted
him
to
promise
all
manner
of
things
before
they
gave
him
their
support
and
finally
to
appease
them
he
answered
that
he
would
combine
their
questions
in
one
and
reply
to
all
that
the
earth
being
round
he
would
if
elected
do
all
in
his
power
to
make
it
square
this
he
found
to
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
the
reformers
solomon
was
a
mere
tyro
in
wisdom
compared
with
that
man
you
would
expect
so
much
sagacity
in
one
who
by
his
own
frank
confession
had
been
raised
on
fried
meat
and
who
declared
that
if
grand
opera
were
attempted
in
his
state
he
would
suspend
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
call
out
the
militia
to
suppress
it
i
was
not
at
all
sure
whether
the
governor
whom
she
quoted
with
so
great
delight
was
an
actual
person
or
a
myth
upon
whom
miss
octavia
hung
her
own
whimsicalities
but
as
if
to
rebuke
my
skepticism
she
dwelt
on
this
personage
at
considerable
length
inviting
my
own
and
cecilia
questions
as
to
her
knowledge
of
him
i
did
suppose
remarked
cecilia
provocatively
that
indiana
was
really
a
place
that
you
could
go
to
on
trains
but
a
kind
of
imaginary
kingdom
like
or
grunewald
or
zenda
or
an
extinct
place
in
asia
where
lions
crouch
upon
the
ruins
in
the
moonlight
indiana
said
miss
octavia
sternly
is
a
commonwealth
for
which
i
have
always
had
the
greatest
veneration
and
which
in
due
course
i
hope
to
visit
in
the
early
seventies
my
father
the
late
hezekiah
hollister
invested
a
considerable
part
of
his
fortune
in
indiana
on
these
investments
the
interest
was
paid
with
only
the
greatest
reluctance
and
in
the
most
fitful
fashion
this
i
think
argues
for
a
keen
sense
of
humor
in
the
hoosier
people
interest
is
something
that
i
should
never
think
of
paying
in
any
circumstances
as
i
have
always
considered
it
immoral
my
father
keenly
enjoying
the
playfulness
of
the
hoosiers
in
this
particular
saved
himself
from
loss
merely
by
raising
the
price
of
throughout
the
world
and
gave
the
mortgages
as
a
free
gift
to
the
society
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
good
indians
all
the
good
indians
being
dead
the
society
had
no
expenses
except
officers
salaries
and
as
the
hoosiers
gave
up
politics
for
a
season
and
raised
enough
corn
to
pay
their
debts
the
society
became
enormously
rich
as
we
rose
from
the
table
miss
octavia
declared
that
she
must
show
me
the
i
was
now
so
accustomed
to
her
ways
that
i
should
not
have
been
in
the
least
surprised
if
she
had
proposed
opening
a
steel
vault
filled
with
a
mummified
egyptian
dynasty
the
gentleman
who
built
this
house
she
explained
had
already
grown
rich
in
the
manufacture
of
the
famous
ribless
umbrella
before
he
acquired
a
second
fortune
from
a
nostrum
warranted
to
cure
dyspepsia
he
was
inordinately
fond
of
pies
and
in
order
that
this
form
of
pastry
might
never
be
absent
from
his
home
he
had
a
special
pantry
built
to
which
he
might
adjourn
at
his
pleasure
without
any
fear
of
finding
the
cupboard
bare
she
led
the
way
through
the
butler
pantry
and
into
a
small
cupboarded
room
adjoining
the
closet
at
her
command
the
butler
threw
open
the
doors
and
disclosed
lines
of
shelves
so
arranged
as
to
accommodate
in
the
most
compact
and
orderly
form
imaginable
several
dozens
of
pies
these
pastries
in
the
pans
as
they
had
come
from
the
oven
peeped
out
invitingly
miss
octavia
explained
their
presence
in
her
usual
impressive
manner
it
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
sale
of
this
house
to
me
by
the
original
owner
executors
that
the
should
be
kept
filled
at
all
times
whether
i
am
in
residence
here
or
not
he
felt
greatly
indebted
to
pie
for
the
success
of
the
dyspepsia
cure
it
had
widened
and
steadily
increased
the
market
for
the
cure
and
pie
was
to
him
a
consecrated
and
sacred
food
it
was
his
habit
to
eat
a
pie
every
night
before
retiring
and
on
the
nightmares
thus
inspired
he
had
planned
the
strategy
of
all
his
campaigns
against
dyspepsia
the
man
had
elements
of
greatness
and
these
shelves
are
a
monument
to
his
genius
in
order
to
keep
perfect
my
title
to
this
property
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
maintain
a
and
as
i
do
not
myself
care
greatly
for
pie
though
contrary
to
common
experience
i
have
found
it
a
splendid
antephialtic
the
total
output
is
distributed
among
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
every
second
day
the
station
agent
at
bedford
is
a
heavy
consumer
and
a
retired
physician
at
mt
kisco
has
a
standing
order
for
a
dozen
a
week
my
niece
hezekiah
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
is
partial
to
a
particular
type
of
pie
and
one
only
it
is
the
gooseberry
that
delights
hezekiah
palate
and
under
g
in
file
in
the
corner
behind
you
there
is
even
now
a
gooseberry
pie
that
i
shall
send
to
hezekiah
who
for
reasons
i
need
not
explain
does
not
now
visit
here
but
the
dyspepsia
man
you
speak
of
him
as
though
he
were
dead
your
assumption
is
correct
ames
the
builder
of
hopefield
died
only
a
few
weeks
after
he
had
established
himself
in
this
house
having
entered
upon
the
enjoyment
of
his
leisure
and
made
it
unnecessary
that
he
should
ever
go
pieless
to
bed
he
gave
himself
up
for
a
fortnight
to
a
mad
indulgence
in
meringues
and
died
after
great
suffering
steadily
refusing
his
own
medicine
to
the
end
we
still
lingered
in
the
after
this
diverting
recital
while
miss
octavia
entertained
me
with
her
views
on
pies
the
of
pies
varies
greatly
ames
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
stands
for
the
homelier
virtues
of
our
civilization
it
is
substantial
nutritious
and
filling
the
custard
and
lemon
varieties
are
feminine
and
do
not
perhaps
for
that
reason
appeal
to
me
at
its
best
is
the
last
and
final
expression
of
the
pie
genus
and
where
cooks
have
been
careful
in
eliminating
the
seeds
and
the
juice
has
made
sodden
dough
of
the
crust
a
meets
the
soul
highest
demands
grape
and
are
on
my
cook
i
consider
them
neither
palatable
nor
respectable
but
rhubarb
is
the
most
odious
pie
of
all
in
my
judgment
it
suggests
the
pharmacopoeia
only
that
and
no
thing
more
you
will
pardon
me
for
mentioning
the
matter
but
one
of
my
gardeners
a
swiss
crawled
in
here
two
nights
ago
and
stole
a
which
i
rejoice
to
say
made
him
hideously
ill
the
r
you
will
notice
are
placed
near
the
floor
and
within
easy
reach
of
any
larcenous
hand
the
ease
of
his
approach
was
his
undoing
the
pumpkin
variety
reaches
almost
the
same
lofty
heights
as
the
cherry
when
not
with
spices
a
conveys
a
sense
of
the
october
landscape
that
is
the
despair
of
the
best
painters
in
the
gooseberry
i
find
a
certain
raciness
or
if
i
may
use
the
expression
zip
that
is
highly
stimulating
both
qualities
you
will
observe
in
hezekiah
if
you
come
to
know
her
well
the
thought
of
blackberry
or
depresses
me
but
huckleberry
buoys
the
spirit
again
the
huckleberry
seems
to
me
to
voice
a
protest
and
unless
managed
with
the
greatest
neatness
and
circumspection
it
is
bound
to
stimulate
the
laundry
business
as
any
one
who
would
eat
a
cooked
strawberry
would
steal
a
sick
rattle
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
even
in
their
season
shall
have
no
place
on
these
shelves
so
it
is
the
gooseberry
that
miss
hezekiah
prefers
i
remarked
with
feigned
carelessness
as
we
walked
toward
the
library
it
is
ames
and
i
trust
that
your
inquiry
implies
no
reflection
on
hezekiah
judgment
quite
the
reverse
miss
hollister
it
is
not
going
too
far
to
say
that
i
have
formed
a
high
opinion
of
miss
hezekiah
and
that
i
should
deal
harshly
with
any
one
who
ventured
to
criticise
her
in
any
particular
will
you
kindly
inform
me
just
when
you
made
the
acquaintance
of
my
younger
niece
i
should
greatly
dislike
to
believe
you
guilty
of
dissimulation
but
when
hezekiah
was
mentioned
in
the
last
night
your
silence
led
me
to
assume
that
she
was
wholly
unknown
to
you
she
was
i
assure
you
at
the
last
night
but
i
met
her
quite
by
chance
this
afternoon
in
an
orchard
at
no
great
distance
from
this
house
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
mention
the
asolando
as
hezekiah
herself
had
taken
pains
to
avoid
her
aunt
in
the
tea
room
it
was
clear
that
my
words
had
interested
miss
octavia
she
paused
in
the
hall
and
bent
her
head
in
thought
for
a
moment
may
i
inquire
whether
she
referred
in
any
way
to
wiggins
in
this
interview
she
did
miss
hollister
i
replied
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
as
i
remembered
hezekiah
laughter
at
the
mention
of
my
friend
my
smile
did
not
escape
miss
octavia
just
how
may
i
ask
did
she
refer
to
mr
wiggins
as
though
she
thought
him
the
funniest
of
human
beings
she
laughed
deliciously
at
the
bare
mention
of
his
name
it
was
not
your
impression
then
that
she
was
deeply
enamored
of
him
that
she
was
eating
her
heart
out
for
him
decidedly
not
miss
hollister
she
gave
me
quite
a
different
idea
you
relieve
me
greatly
wiggins
sense
of
humor
is
the
slightest
and
i
should
not
in
the
least
fancy
him
for
hezekiah
and
besides
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
arrange
a
marriage
for
her
she
laid
the
slightest
stress
on
the
final
pronoun
it
was
a
fair
inference
then
that
miss
cecilia
affairs
were
being
arranged
when
they
had
been
determined
a
husband
would
be
found
for
hezekiah
but
had
there
ever
existed
before
anywhere
in
the
copernican
system
a
wealthy
aunt
so
delightfully
irresponsible
so
vertiginous
in
her
mental
processes
so
happily
combining
the
maddest
quixotism
with
the
bold
spirit
of
the
elizabethan
mariners
my
faith
in
the
real
sweetness
and
kindliness
of
her
nature
was
unshaken
by
her
capriciousness
i
did
not
doubt
that
her
intentions
toward
her
nieces
were
the
friendliest
no
matter
what
strange
devices
she
might
employ
to
bend
those
young
women
to
her
purposes
she
disappeared
in
the
hall
without
excuse
and
i
entered
the
library
to
find
cecilia
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
she
put
aside
a
book
she
had
been
reading
and
seeing
that
her
aunt
had
not
followed
me
asked
at
once
as
to
my
visit
to
the
inn
i
conveyed
your
message
i
answered
but
you
have
seen
wiggins
since
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
yes
he
called
this
afternoon
we
had
several
callers
at
the
i
had
rather
expected
you
back
the
fact
is
i
replied
that
after
i
had
taken
luncheon
at
the
prescott
arms
i
got
lost
among
the
hills
and
while
in
the
act
of
robbing
an
i
came
most
unexpectedly
upon
your
sister
hezekiah
the
same
and
oddly
enough
i
had
met
her
before
though
i
did
realize
it
was
she
until
the
meeting
in
the
orchard
it
was
in
the
asolando
that
i
saw
her
she
was
at
the
cashier
wicket
the
afternoon
i
met
your
aunt
there
she
seemed
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
her
eyes
brightened
and
she
laughed
but
her
laugh
was
not
like
hezekiah
cecilia
mirth
had
its
own
expression
it
was
touched
with
a
sweet
gravity
and
her
laughter
was
such
as
one
would
expect
from
the
milo
if
that
divine
marble
were
to
yield
to
mirth
cecilia
grew
upon
me
there
was
magic
in
her
loveliness
she
was
a
finished
product
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
she
and
the
girl
with
whom
i
had
exchanged
banter
in
the
upland
orchard
were
daughters
of
one
mother
you
have
given
me
information
ames
i
did
not
know
that
hezekiah
had
ever
been
connected
with
the
asolando
oh
it
was
only
that
one
historic
day
she
says
the
place
was
unbearable
she
jarred
the
holiest
chords
of
the
divine
lyre
by
harsh
comments
on
the
profile
one
of
the
devotees
was
so
shocked
that
she
dropped
a
plate
or
something
and
to
put
it
coarsely
hezekiah
got
the
bounce
my
description
of
hezekiah
brief
tenure
of
office
at
the
asolando
seemed
to
amuse
cecilia
greatly
there
is
no
one
like
my
sister
she
said
there
never
was
and
there
never
will
be
any
one
half
so
charming
hezekiah
is
an
original
who
breaks
all
the
rules
and
yet
always
sends
the
ball
over
the
net
and
it
is
because
she
is
so
inexpressibly
dear
and
precious
that
i
am
anxious
that
nothing
shall
ever
hurt
her
nothing
mar
the
sweet
beautiful
in
her
it
was
my
turn
to
laugh
now
cecilia
manifestation
of
maternal
solicitude
for
hezekiah
seemed
absurd
for
hezekiah
in
her
way
was
older
hezekiah
had
raced
with
diana
and
plucked
arrows
from
her
girdle
she
had
heard
homer
at
the
roadside
singing
of
achilles
shield
hezekiah
is
reasonably
safe
i
should
say
because
she
is
so
amazingly
swift
of
foot
and
eye
and
so
nimble
of
speech
she
is
not
to
be
caught
in
a
net
or
tripped
with
a
word
i
suppose
that
is
so
remarked
cecilia
soberly
you
thought
her
happy
when
you
met
her
she
did
not
strike
you
as
being
a
girl
with
a
wound
in
her
heart
she
was
particularly
not
more
so
than
sunlight
on
rippled
water
or
the
song
of
the
lark
ascending
of
course
you
made
no
reference
to
wiggins
if
i
had
imagined
you
would
meet
her
i
should
have
she
ended
with
an
embarrassment
that
i
now
understood
and
i
broke
in
cheerfully
we
did
mention
him
she
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
him
and
it
was
the
thought
of
him
that
evoked
her
merriest
laughter
she
shook
her
head
and
sighed
then
her
manner
changed
abruptly
you
delivered
my
message
to
mr
wiggins
i
did
he
is
badly
out
of
sorts
and
sees
nothing
clearly
he
is
very
bitter
toward
your
aunt
he
thinks
she
has
treated
him
outrageously
aunt
octavia
has
done
nothing
of
the
kind
she
replied
with
spirit
wiggins
has
no
right
to
speak
of
aunt
octavia
save
in
terms
of
kindness
if
her
wits
are
sharper
than
his
it
is
not
her
fault
that
i
can
see
but
there
are
matters
here
that
i
do
not
understand
ames
i
trust
you
as
my
aunt
evidently
does
or
i
should
not
be
talking
to
you
as
i
am
and
i
am
moved
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
a
favor
of
considerable
weight
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
are
a
professional
man
with
doubtless
many
pressing
calls
upon
your
time
i
bowed
humbly
before
this
compliment
my
time
had
been
lightly
appraised
by
miss
octavia
and
again
by
wiggins
a
long
telegram
from
my
assistant
that
reached
me
while
i
dressed
for
dinner
had
urged
my
immediate
attendance
upon
my
office
some
of
my
best
clients
now
reopening
their
houses
for
the
winter
were
in
desperate
straits
from
the
number
of
appeals
for
help
reported
by
my
assistant
i
judged
that
all
the
chimneys
in
the
republic
had
grown
obstreperous
but
father
time
learned
early
in
his
career
that
to
women
his
scythe
edge
has
no
terrors
in
this
instance
i
must
admit
that
if
cecilia
hollister
wished
to
cut
a
few
days
out
of
my
reasonable
expectation
of
life
it
was
not
for
me
to
plead
sick
chimneys
as
an
excuse
for
declining
to
serve
her
in
fact
i
had
never
found
myself
so
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
adventure
that
we
all
crave
as
since
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
hollisters
octavia
hollisters
do
not
occur
in
the
life
of
every
young
man
and
both
cecilia
and
hezekiah
had
taken
strong
hold
upon
my
imagination
wiggins
place
among
the
dramatis
personæ
would
in
itself
have
compelled
my
sympathetic
attention
and
the
nine
silk
hats
that
i
had
seen
bobbing
over
the
stile
still
danced
before
my
eyes
miss
hollister
i
said
my
time
is
yours
to
command
my
office
is
well
organized
and
i
am
sure
that
my
assistant
is
equal
to
any
demands
that
may
be
made
upon
him
pray
state
in
what
manner
i
may
serve
you
i
am
going
far
i
know
ames
but
i
beg
that
you
will
not
be
in
haste
to
leave
my
aunt
house
she
must
have
been
strongly
prejudiced
in
your
favor
or
she
would
not
have
asked
you
here
on
so
short
acquaintance
i
am
confident
that
she
has
no
thought
of
your
leaving
she
expressed
her
great
liking
for
you
at
luncheon
and
i
am
sure
that
she
will
see
to
it
that
you
do
not
lack
for
entertainment
i
assume
that
you
must
have
gathered
from
what
wiggins
told
you
of
my
acquaintance
with
him
the
peculiar
plight
in
which
i
am
placed
i
bowed
if
she
groped
in
the
dark
and
needed
my
help
in
finding
the
light
i
was
not
the
man
to
desert
her
i
had
dropped
my
into
too
many
dark
chimneys
not
to
feel
the
fascination
of
mystery
as
i
expressed
again
my
entire
willingness
to
abide
at
hopefield
manor
as
long
as
she
wished
the
footman
announced
hartley
wiggins
we
had
hardly
exchanged
greetings
before
another
man
was
announced
and
then
another
i
should
say
that
it
was
at
intervals
of
about
three
minutes
that
the
sedate
servant
appeared
in
the
curtained
doorway
and
announced
a
caller
until
nine
had
been
admitted
my
spirits
soared
high
as
the
gentlemen
from
the
prescott
arms
appeared
one
after
the
other
the
earlier
arrivals
rose
to
greet
the
later
ones
and
as
they
were
all
in
evening
clothes
i
experienced
as
when
i
had
seen
the
same
gentlemen
in
their
afternoon
raiment
crossing
the
stile
a
sense
of
something
fantastic
and
eerie
in
them
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
them
taken
as
individuals
collectively
they
were
like
studies
in
black
and
white
that
had
stepped
from
their
frames
for
an
evening
recreation
cecilia
introduced
me
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
and
in
the
interest
of
brevity
and
to
avoid
confusion
i
tabulate
them
here
with
a
notation
as
to
their
residence
and
occupation
taking
such
data
from
the
notebook
in
which
at
subsequent
dates
i
set
down
the
facts
which
are
the
basis
of
this

we
rose
and
stood
in
our
several
places
when
a
moment
later
miss
octavia
entered
she
greeted
the
suitors
graciously
and
then
in
her
most
charming
manner
called
one
after
the
other
to
sit
beside
her
on
a
long
davenport
the
time
apportioned
being
weighed
with
nicety
so
that
none
might
feel
himself
slighted
or
preferred
these
interviews
consumed
more
than
half
an
hour
and
the
movement
thus
occasioned
gave
considerable
animation
to
the
scene
it
may
seem
ridiculous
that
nine
gentlemen
thus
paying
court
to
a
young
woman
should
call
upon
her
at
the
same
hour
but
i
must
say
that
the
gravity
of
the
suitors
and
the
entire
sobriety
of
cecilia
did
not
affect
me
humorously
nor
did
i
feel
at
all
out
of
place
in
this
strange
company
i
found
myself
agreeably
engaged
for
several
minutes
in
discussing
ibsen
with
the
oklahoma
professor
who
proved
to
be
a
delightful
fellow
his
experience
of
life
was
apparently
wide
and
he
told
me
with
an
engaging
frankness
of
his
meeting
with
the
hollisters
in
france
and
of
his
pursuit
of
them
over
many
weary
parasangs
the
previous
summer
as
no
one
had
elected
his
courses
in
the
university
at
the
beginning
of
the
fall
term
he
had
been
granted
a
leave
of
absence
and
this
accounted
for
his
freedom
to
press
his
suit
at
hopefield
manor
at
this
season
he
was
a
big
fellow
with
features
and
bore
himself
with
a
manly
determination
that
i
found
attractive
he
alone
i
may
say
of
the
nine
men
who
had
thus
appeared
in
miss
octavia
library
met
me
in
a
cordial
spirit
even
wiggins
seemed
not
wholly
pleased
to
find
me
there
again
though
he
had
asked
me
to
remain
the
manner
of
the
others
expressed
either
disdain
suspicion
or
fierce
hostility
and
lord
arrowood
who
was
older
than
the
others
and
a
man
well
advanced
toward
middle
age
glared
at
me
so
savagely
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
that
i
should
have
laughed
in
his
face
in
any
other
circumstances
when
the
last
man
rose
from
the
davenport
miss
octavia
called
me
to
her
side
she
seemed
contrite
at
having
neglected
me
during
the
day
but
assured
me
that
later
she
hoped
to
place
an
entire
day
at
my
disposal
as
we
talked
the
nine
suitors
sat
in
a
semicircle
about
cecilia
while
the
group
listened
to
an
anecdotal
exchange
between
professor
hume
and
henderson
the
virginia
planter
my
opinion
of
cecilia
hollister
as
a
girl
of
high
spirit
able
to
carry
off
any
situation
no
matter
how
difficult
rose
to
new
altitudes
as
i
watched
her
if
this
strange
wooing
was
not
to
her
liking
she
certainly
made
the
best
of
it
she
capped
henderson
best
story
with
a
better
one
in
negro
dialect
and
no
professional
entertainer
could
have
improved
upon
her
recital
as
she
finished
we
all
joined
in
the
general
laugh
lord
arrowood
guffaw
booming
out
a
trifle
boisterously
when
miss
octavia
quietly
rose
and
excused
herself
about
five
minutes
later
when
the
company
had
plunged
into
another
series
of
anecdotes
i
suddenly
became
conscious
that
the
fireplace
near
which
i
sat
had
all
at
once
begun
to
act
strangely
much
in
the
manner
of
its
performance
the
previous
night
it
abruptly
gasped
and
choked
the
smoke
ballooned
in
a
great
swirl
and
then
poured
out
into
the
room
after
my
examination
of
the
flues
in
the
morning
i
had
dismissed
them
from
my
mind
and
this
extraordinary
behavior
of
the
library
fireplace
astounded
me
it
is
not
in
reason
that
a
perfectly
normal
fireplace
built
in
the
most
approved
fashion
and
with
chimneys
that
rise
into
as
clear
an
ether
as
october
can
bestow
could
act
so
monstrously
without
the
intervention
of
some
malign
agency
we
had
discussed
all
the
possibilities
the
previous
night
and
i
was
not
anxious
to
hear
further
lay
opinions
the
chimney
conduct
was
annoying
the
more
so
that
to
my
professional
sense
it
was
inexplicable
lord
arrowood
had
retreated
discreetly
toward
the
door
and
the
others
had
risen
and
stood
close
behind
cecilia
whose
gaze
was
bent
rather
accusingly
upon
me
a
dark
thought
had
crossed
my
mind
as
our
eyes
met
i
felt
that
she
had
read
my
suspicions
and
did
not
wholly
reject
them
henderson
was
valiantly
poking
the
logs
while
one
or
two
of
the
other
men
gave
him
the
benefit
of
their
advice
i
crossed
the
hall
to
the
but
no
one
was
there
i
went
back
to
the
but
saw
nothing
of
miss
octavia
cecilia
had
rung
for
the
footman
and
i
passed
him
in
the
hall
on
his
way
to
answer
her
summons
i
stopped
him
with
an
inquiry
on
my
lips
but
i
could
not
ask
the
question
even
in
my
perplexity
as
to
the
cause
of
the
chimney
remarkable
performances
i
did
not
so
far
forget
myself
as
to
communicate
my
suspicion
to
a
servant
nothing
thomas
i
said
and
the
man
passed
on
it
was
possible
of
course
that
miss
octavia
knew
more
than
she
cared
to
tell
about
the
erratic
ways
of
the
library
chimney
or
she
might
indeed
be
the
cause
of
its
vagaries
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
after
her
retirement
from
the
library
to
allow
her
to
gain
the
roof
and
clap
a
stopper
on
the
this
did
not
however
account
for
the
fact
that
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
been
present
in
the
library
when
the
same
chimney
had
manifested
a
similar
sulkiness
i
was
still
pondering
these
things
when
i
heard
loud
laughter
from
the
library
and
on
returning
found
the
logs
again
blazing
in
the
fireplace
from
which
the
smoke
rose
demurely
in
the
flue
this
fireplace
is
like
a
geyser
ames
said
cecilia
and
spurts
smoke
at
regular
intervals
as
i
remember
the
clock
on
the
stair
was
striking
nine
last
night
when
the
smoke
poured
out
and
there
it
is
striking
nine
now
she
tossed
her
head
slightly
and
this
was
i
thought
in
disdain
of
the
suspicion
that
must
still
have
shown
itself
a
little
stubbornly
in
my
face
i
withdrew
again
in
a
few
minutes
and
followed
the
great
course
upward
miss
octavia
apartments
were
at
the
front
of
the
house
her
windows
looking
out
upon
the
italian
garden
her
doors
were
closed
but
i
knew
from
my
examination
in
the
morning
that
the
flue
of
her
fireplace
tapped
the
chimney
that
rose
from
the
and
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
library
chimney
from
the
fourth
floor
i
gained
the
roof
by
the
route
followed
on
my
inspection
of
the
house
in
the
morning
the
smoke
from
the
library
chimney
was
rising
in
the
crisp
still
air
blithely
i
leaned
upon
the
crenelations
and
looked
off
across
the
hills
enjoying
the
loveliness
of
the
sky
in
which
the
planets
throbbed
superbly
there
was
nothing
to
be
learned
here
and
i
crept
back
to
the
through
which
i
had
come
made
it
fast
and
continued
on
down
to
the
library
there
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
in
my
absence
all
but
hume
had
taken
their
departure
as
i
paused
unseen
in
the
doorway
i
caught
words
that
were
clearly
not
intended
for
my
ear
cecilia
sat
by
the
long
table
near
the
fireplace
hume
stood
before
her
his
arms
folded
you
are
kind
you
do
me
great
honor
professor
hume
but
under
no
circumstances
can
i
become
your
wife
i
retreated
hastily
to
the
where
i
took
a
cue
from
the
rack
and
amused
myself
for
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
when
hearing
the
outer
door
close
and
knowing
that
hume
had
departed
with
his
congee
i
returned
to
the
library
cecilia
sat
where
i
had
left
her
and
at
first
glance
i
thought
she
was
reading
but
she
turned
quickly
as
i
crossed
the
room
she
held
in
her
hand
an
oblong
silver
trinket
not
larger
than
a
a
short
pencil
similar
to
those
affixed
to
was
attached
to
it
by
a
slight
cord
and
she
had
i
inferred
been
making
a
notation
of
some
kind
on
a
leaf
of
the
booklet
even
after
she
had
looked
up
and
smiled
at
me
her
eyes
sought
the
page
before
her
then
she
closed
the
covers
and
clasped
the
pretty
toy
in
her
hand
as
though
to
divert
my
attention
she
recurred
at
once
to
the
chimney
in
a
vein
of
light
irony
you
see
she
said
there
is
ample
reason
for
your
remaining
here
you
would
hardly
find
anywhere
else
so
interesting
a
test
of
your
professional
powers
as
hopefield
manor
offers
the
house
is
haunted
beyond
question
and
i
can
see
that
you
are
not
a
man
to
leave
two
defenseless
women
to
the
mercy
of
a
ghost
who
drops
down
chimneys
at
will
i
suffered
her
chaff
for
several
minutes
then
i
asked
pardon
me
but
have
you
the
slightest
idea
that
miss
octavia
is
behind
this
it
is
not
possible
that
she
was
responsible
last
night
but
she
was
not
on
this
floor
a
while
ago
when
the
smoke
poured
in
here
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
your
opinion
i
saw
that
you
suspected
her
before
you
left
the
room
ames
and
i
must
say
that
the
idea
is
in
no
way
creditable
to
you
if
you
entertain
such
a
suspicion
you
must
supply
a
motive
and
just
what
motive
would
you
attribute
to
my
aunt
octavia
in
this
instance
her
tone
and
manner
piqued
me
or
i
should
not
have
answered
as
i
did
it
is
possible
i
said
that
some
of
these
gentlemen
who
came
here
were
not
to
her
liking
and
it
may
have
occurred
to
her
to
get
rid
of
them
by
the
obviously
successful
method
of
smoking
them
out
she
rose
still
clasping
the
little
and
looked
me
over
with
amusement
in
her
face
and
eyes
you
are
almost
too
ingenious
ames
i
hope
that
by
you
will
have
some
more
plausible
solution
of
the
problem
and
so
tightly
clasping
the
little
book
she
left
the
room
i
followed
her
to
the
door
and
at
the
turn
of
the
stair
she
glanced
down
and
nodded
her
face
as
it
hung
above
me
for
an
instant
seemed
transfigured
with
happiness
but
as
will
appear
my
adventures
for
the
day
were
not
concluded
ix
i
meet
a
playful
ghost
it
was
not
yet
ten
and
i
was
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
being
left
to
my
own
devices
in
this
big
at
an
hour
when
the
talk
at
the
hare
and
tortoise
usually
became
worth
while
i
sat
down
and
began
to
turn
over
the
periodicals
on
the
library
table
but
i
was
in
no
mood
for
reading
the
butler
appeared
and
offered
me
drink
but
the
thought
of
drinking
alone
did
not
appeal
to
me
i
repelled
the
suggestion
coldly
but
after
i
had
dropped
my
eyes
to
the
english
review
i
had
taken
up
i
was
conscious
that
he
stood
his
ground
beg
pardon
sir
well
hit
a
bit
hod
about
the
chimney
sir
the
professional
man
in
me
was
at
once
alert
the
chimney
conduct
was
inexplicable
enough
but
i
was
in
no
humor
to
brook
the
theories
of
a
stupid
servant
still
he
might
know
something
so
i
nodded
for
him
to
go
on
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
came
a
step
nearer
they
say
in
the
village
sir
that
the
is
what
sir
who
say
it
james
the
liveryman
told
the
coachman
and
the
got
hit
from
a
seamstress
hit
werry
queer
sir
rubbish
james
i
amazed
that
a
person
of
your
station
should
listen
to
a
liveryman
gossip
there
the
chimney
it
working
perfectly
some
shift
of
causes
it
to
puff
a
little
smoke
into
this
room
occasionally
but
those
things
are
not
related
to
the
supernatural
we
find
some
way
of
correcting
it
in
a
day
or
two
werry
good
sir
but
begging
pardon
the
chimney
hai
hall
hit
walks
if
i
may
so
hexpress
hit
walks
i
exclaimed
sitting
up
and
throwing
down
my
review
what
walks
you
hit
sir
hin
the
walls
hit
goes
right
through
the
solid
brick
most
hunaccountable
you
hear
a
mouse
in
the
walls
and
think
it
a
ghost
but
you
forget
james
that
this
is
a
new
house
only
a
year
or
so
old
and
spooks
do
frequent
such
places
if
it
were
an
old
place
it
might
be
possible
that
the
creaking
of
floors
and
the
settling
of
walls
would
cause
uneasiness
in
nervous
people
the
ghost
tradition
usually
rests
on
some
ugly
fact
but
here
nothing
of
the
kind
is
present
hit
was
one
of
majesty
horfficers
sir
he
answered
hoarsely
illustration
hit
was
one
of
majesty
horfficers
sir
he
answered
hoarsely
it
flashed
over
me
that
this
big
stolid
fellow
was
out
of
his
head
but
sane
or
mad
he
was
clearly
greatly
disturbed
it
was
best
i
thought
on
either
hypothesis
to
speak
to
him
peremptorily
and
i
rose
the
better
to
deal
with
the
situation
what
nonsense
is
this
you
have
in
your
head
you
in
the
united
states
and
there
are
any
majesty
soldiers
to
deal
with
you
forget
that
you
not
in
england
now
but
this
country
used
to
be
henglish
you
may
recall
sir
the
story
the
coachman
got
hin
the
village
goes
back
to
the
hold
times
sir
when
the
colonies
was
hin
rebellion
if
i
may
so
call
hit
sir
and
majesty
troops
was
puttin
down
the
rebellion
hin
these
parts
some
american
rebels
chased
a
british
soldier
from
hover
near
white
plains
to
these
woods
as
they
was
then
and
they
sir
right
where
this
stands
if
i
may
make
so
free
ah
this
is
a
revolutionary
relic
then
you
got
hit
sir
he
sputtered
eagerly
they
the
man
right
where
the
stands
that
not
a
bad
story
james
and
what
does
your
mistress
say
about
it
well
sir
hit
the
talk
hin
the
village
that
that
why
she
bought
the
place
sir
she
rather
fancies
ghosts
and
the
like
as
you
may
know
sir
be
careful
what
you
say
james
miss
hollister
is
a
noble
and
wise
lady
and
you
do
well
to
give
her
your
best
service
we
all
fond
of
sir
though
she
a
bit
troubled
hin
the
if
i
may
make
so
bold
she
says
a
good
ghost
is
a
hasset
i
did
not
at
once
catch
with
an
aspirate
but
when
he
repeated
it
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
you
better
go
to
bed
james
and
do
encourage
talk
among
the
other
servants
about
this
ghost
i
know
something
about
the
building
of
houses
and
i
give
these
walls
a
good
looking
over
it
was
apparent
that
my
interview
had
not
cheered
him
greatly
he
turned
at
the
door
to
ask
if
i
would
put
out
the
lights
and
fear
was
so
clearly
written
upon
his
big
red
face
that
i
dismissed
him
sharply
i
made
myself
comfortable
for
an
hour
smoking
a
cigar
over
an
article
on
english
politics
and
while
i
read
a
big
log
placidly
burned
itself
to
ashes
i
found
the
switch
and
snapped
out
the
library
lights
when
i
had
gained
the
second
floor
i
turned
off
the
lights
in
the
hall
below
and
as
i
looked
down
the
well
to
make
sure
i
had
turned
the
right
key
the
third
floor
lights
suddenly
died
and
i
was
left
in
darkness
this
was
the
least
bit
disconcerting
i
was
quite
sure
that
the
upper
lights
had
remained
burning
brightly
after
the
darkening
of
the
lower
hall
so
that
it
was
hardly
possible
that
the
one
switch
had
cut
off
both
lights
standing
by
the
rail
that
guarded
the
well
i
peered
upward
thinking
that
some
one
above
me
was
manipulating
another
switch
but
the
silence
was
as
complete
as
the
blackness
i
was
about
to
turn
from
the
rail
to
the
wall
to
find
the
switch
but
at
this
moment
as
my
face
was
still
lifted
in
the
intentness
with
which
i
was
listening
something
brushed
my
cheek
something
soft
of
touch
and
swift
of
movement
as
i
gripped
the
rail
i
felt
this
touch
once
twice
thrice
then
my
hand
sought
the
wall
madly
and
with
so
bad
an
aim
that
it
was
quite
a
minute
before
i
found
the
and
snapped
all
the
keys
the
stair
and
the
halls
above
and
below
me
sprang
into
being
again
and
i
stood
blinking
stupidly
upward
though
i
was
in
a
modern
house
thoroughly
lighted
by
electricity
i
can
not
deny
that
this
incident
following
so
quickly
upon
the
story
occasioned
a
moment
acute
horripilation
accompanied
by
an
uncomfortable
tremor
of
the
legs
as
already
hinted
i
lay
no
claim
to
great
valor
as
for
ghosts
i
am
half
persuaded
of
their
existence
and
after
witnessing
a
presentation
of
hamlet
always
feel
that
shakespeare
is
as
safe
a
guide
in
such
matters
as
the
destructive
scientific
critics
there
were
various
plausible
explanations
of
the
failure
of
the
lights
some
switch
that
i
did
not
know
of
perhaps
in
the
hall
might
have
been
turned
or
the
power
house
in
the
village
might
have
been
shifting
dynamos
either
solution
of
the
riddle
was
credible
but
the
ghostly
touch
on
my
face
could
not
be
accounted
for
so
readily
leaving
the
lights
on
i
continued
to
the
third
floor
and
examined
the
switch
and
sought
in
other
ways
to
explain
these
phenomena
my
composure
returned
more
slowly
than
i
care
to
confess
and
i
think
it
was
probably
in
my
mind
that
the
ghost
of
king
george
dead
soldier
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
me
but
i
saw
and
heard
nothing
the
doors
of
the
unused
chambers
on
the
third
floor
were
closed
and
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
trying
them
the
servants
were
housed
on
this
floor
at
the
rear
of
the
house
and
a
door
that
cut
off
their
quarters
proved
on
examination
to
be
tightly
locked
the
fourth
floor
was
only
a
used
for
storage
purposes
the
roof
was
gained
i
recalled
by
an
iron
ladder
and
a
hatchway
in
a
i
ran
down
to
my
room
and
found
a
candle
to
be
armed
against
any
further
fickleness
of
the
lights
and
set
out
for
the
fourth
floor
i
had
changed
my
coat
and
with
a
couple
of
candles
and
a
box
of
matches
started
for
the
roof
my
courage
had
risen
now
and
i
was
ready
for
any
further
adventure
that
the
night
might
hold
for
me
miss
hollister
and
cecilia
were
both
in
their
rooms
presumably
asleep
the
servants
doubtless
had
their
doors
barred
against
ghostly
visitors
and
the
house
was
mine
to
explore
as
i
pleased
i
think
i
was
humming
slightly
as
i
mounted
the
stair
which
in
keeping
with
the
general
luxuriousness
that
characterized
the
furnishing
of
the
house
was
thickly
carpeted
even
to
the
fourth
floor
i
was
slipping
my
hand
along
the
rail
and
mounting
i
dare
say
a
little
jauntily
as
i
screwed
my
courage
to
an
unfamiliar
notch
when
suddenly
midway
of
the
first
half
and
just
before
i
reached
the
turn
where
the
stair
broke
the
lights
failed
again
with
startling
abruptness
this
was
carrying
the
joke
pretty
far
and
instantly
i
clapped
my
hand
to
my
pocket
for
the
box
of
dug
it
out
and
then
in
my
haste
dropped
the
lid
essential
to
ignition
and
stooped
to
find
it
the
stair
had
narrowed
on
this
flight
and
as
i
sought
with
futile
eagerness
to
regain
the
i
could
have
sworn
that
some
one
passed
me
still
i
stretched
out
my
arms
and
clasped
empty
air
and
so
suddenly
had
i
thrown
myself
forward
that
i
lost
my
balance
and
rolled
downward
the
space
of
half
a
dozen
treads
before
i
recovered
myself
i
was
badly
scared
and
hardly
less
angry
at
having
missed
through
my
own
clumsiness
the
joy
of
grappling
with
the
ghost
of
one
of
king
george
soldiers
but
the
matches
having
been
lost
in
the
of
the
stair
i
could
get
my
bearings
again
only
by
clinging
to
the
until
i
found
the
switch
i
should
say
that
two
full
minutes
had
passed
between
the
loss
of
the
matches
and
my
flashing
on
of
the
lamps
from
top
to
bottom
the
lights
shone
brightly
but
no
one
was
visible
and
i
heard
no
sound
in
any
part
of
the
house
as
i
began
to
analyze
my
sensations
during
the
temporary
eclipse
of
the
lights
i
was
conscious
of
two
things
the
being
human
or
other
that
had
passed
me
had
been
light
of
step
and
fleet
of
motion
there
had
been
something
uncanny
in
the
ease
and
speed
of
that
passing
i
was
without
conviction
as
to
its
direction
whether
up
or
down
though
i
inclined
to
the
former
notion
for
the
reason
that
the
employment
of
a
concealed
switch
above
seemed
the
more
reasonable
argument
and
a
faint
an
almost
imperceptible
scent
as
of
a
flower
had
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
passing
mine
is
a
sensitive
nostril
and
i
was
confident
that
it
did
not
betray
me
in
this
the
sensation
stirred
by
that
faintest
of
odors
had
been
agreeable
there
was
nothing
suggestive
of
or
cerecloth
about
it
there
was
in
fact
something
rather
delightfully
human
and
contemporaneous
in
this
fellow
that
pleased
and
reassured
me
that
scamp
of
a
revolutionary
british
soldier
resenting
as
was
his
right
the
application
of
hemp
to
his
precious
neck
had
still
a
grace
in
him
and
a
ghost
who
prowls
undaunted
about
an
house
in
this
twentieth
century
having
his
whim
with
the
switches
can
not
be
an
utterly
bad
fellow
my
respect
for
all
who
are
doomed
to
walk
the
night
rose
as
leaving
the
lights
on
clear
to
the
lower
hall
i
gathered
up
my
matches
and
started
again
for
the
roof
the
door
opened
readily
as
on
my
morning
inspection
of
the
but
as
i
glanced
up
i
saw
that
the
hatch
was
open
through
the
aperture
shone
the
heavens
a
square
of
stars
and
bright
with
the
moon
radiance
pocketing
my
matches
i
ran
nimbly
up
the
ladder
x
my
befuddlement
increases
i
had
been
surprised
to
find
the
hatch
open
but
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
i
was
greatly
astonished
by
what
i
saw
on
the
roof
there
midway
of
a
flat
area
that
lay
between
the
two
larger
two
persons
were
intently
engaged
not
in
ghostly
promenading
or
posturing
or
even
in
audible
conversation
but
in
a
spirited
bout
with
foils
the
clicking
and
scraping
of
the
steel
testified
unmistakably
to
the
reality
of
their
presence
and
i
was
grateful
for
those
sounds
it
needed
only
silence
to
tumble
me
back
down
the
trap
with
chattering
teeth
but
these
were
beyond
question
corporeal
beings
albeit
rendered
weird
and
fantastical
by
the
oddity
of
their
playground
and
the
soft
effulgence
of
the
moon
the
vigor
of
the
onset
and
the
skill
of
the
antagonists
held
me
spellbound
i
stood
with
head
and
shoulders
thrust
through
the
opening
staring
at
this
unusual
spectacle
and
not
sure
but
that
after
all
my
eyes
were
tricking
me
it
was
a
woman
voice
faint
from
breathlessness
she
threw
off
her
mask
and
dropped
her
foil
and
with
a
most
human
and
feminine
gesture
put
up
her
hands
to
adjust
her
hair
it
was
cecilia
hollister
in
a
short
skirt
and
fencing
coat
her
opponent
was
a
man
and
as
he
too
flung
off
his
mask
i
saw
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
years
if
miss
cecilia
hollister
chose
to
meet
strange
men
on
the
roof
of
her
aunt
house
and
practice
the
art
with
them
it
was
no
affair
of
mine
and
i
was
about
to
withdraw
when
the
stranger
swung
round
and
saw
me
his
sudden
exclamation
caused
the
girl
to
turn
and
as
a
reasonable
frankness
has
always
seemed
to
me
essential
to
a
nice
discretion
i
crawled
out
on
the
roof
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
hollister
but
if
i
had
known
you
were
here
i
should
not
have
intruded
the
vagaries
of
the
library
chimney
have
been
on
my
mind
and
i
was
about
to
have
another
peep
into
yonder
pot
she
stood
at
her
ease
with
one
hand
resting
lightly
against
the
inexplicable
chimney
in
question
and
still
somewhat
spent
from
her
exercise
illustration
she
stood
at
her
ease
with
one
hand
resting
lightly
against
the
inexplicable
chimney
father
she
said
turning
to
the
stranger
who
stood
near
this
is
ames
who
is
aunt
octavia
guest
the
light
of
the
gibbous
moon
enabled
me
to
discern
pretty
clearly
the
form
and
features
of
bassford
hollister
and
i
find
in
looking
over
my
notes
that
i
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
the
singular
meeting
with
my
hostess
brother
i
had
grown
so
used
to
the
ways
of
the
hollisters
i
already
knew
that
the
meeting
with
another
member
of
the
family
at
eleven
at
night
on
the
roof
of
this
remarkable
house
gave
me
no
great
shock
of
surprise
he
was
tall
slender
and
dark
with
fine
eyes
that
suggested
cecilia
his
beard
was
slightly
gray
but
he
bore
himself
erect
and
i
had
already
seen
that
he
was
alert
of
arm
and
eye
and
nimble
of
foot
he
put
on
his
coat
which
had
been
lying
across
one
of
the
crenelations
and
covered
his
head
with
a
small
soft
hat
this
will
do
for
cecilia
you
had
the
best
of
me
we
try
again
another
time
i
glad
you
stopped
us
ames
we
had
enough
he
seemed
in
no
wise
disturbed
by
my
appearance
nor
in
any
haste
to
leave
this
meeting
between
the
father
and
daughter
i
reasoned
could
hardly
have
been
a
matter
of
chance
and
it
must
have
been
in
mind
that
some
sort
of
explanation
would
not
be
amiss
father
and
i
have
fenced
together
for
years
she
said
my
sister
hezekiah
does
not
care
for
the
sport
as
you
have
already
seen
that
my
aunt
octavia
is
an
unusual
woman
given
to
many
whims
i
will
not
deny
to
you
that
at
present
my
father
is
non
in
this
house
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
nothing
to
his
discredit
or
mine
has
contributed
to
that
situation
nor
can
our
meeting
here
be
construed
as
detrimental
to
him
or
to
me
in
meeting
my
father
in
this
way
i
have
in
a
sense
broken
faith
with
my
aunt
octavia
but
i
assure
you
ames
that
it
is
only
the
natural
affection
for
a
daughter
that
led
my
father
to
seek
me
here
in
this
clandestine
fashion
cecilia
had
spoken
steadily
but
her
voice
broke
as
she
concluded
and
she
walked
quickly
toward
the
hatchway
her
father
stepped
before
me
to
give
her
his
hand
through
the
opening
i
withdrew
to
the
edge
of
the
roof
while
a
few
words
passed
between
them
that
seemed
to
be
on
his
part
an
expostulation
and
on
hers
an
earnest
denial
and
plea
he
passed
her
the
foils
and
masks
and
she
vanished
whereupon
he
addressed
himself
to
me
i
had
learned
from
both
my
daughters
of
your
presence
in
my
house
and
i
had
expected
to
meet
you
sooner
or
later
this
is
a
strange
business
a
strange
business
he
had
drawn
out
a
pipe
which
he
filled
and
lighted
dexterously
the
flame
of
his
match
gave
me
better
acquaintance
with
his
face
he
leaned
against
the
serrated
with
the
greatest
composure
his
hat
tilted
to
one
side
and
drew
his
pipe
to
a
glow
i
had
not
forgotten
my
encounter
with
the
ghost
on
the
stair
and
as
i
waited
for
him
to
speak
i
was
trying
to
identify
him
with
the
mysterious
agency
that
had
tampered
with
the
lights
and
passed
so
ghostly
a
hand
across
my
face
in
the
i
could
hardly
say
that
there
had
not
been
time
for
either
bassford
hollister
or
his
daughter
to
have
reached
the
roof
after
my
experiences
on
the
stair
and
yet
they
had
been
engaged
so
earnestly
at
the
moment
of
my
appearance
at
the
hatchway
that
it
was
improbable
that
either
could
have
played
ghost
and
flown
to
the
roof
before
i
reached
it
and
eliminating
the
ghost
altogether
i
had
yet
to
learn
how
bassford
hollister
had
gained
entrance
to
the
house
it
seemed
best
to
drop
speculations
and
wait
for
him
to
declare
himself
you
must
understand
ames
that
my
daughters
both
of
them
are
very
dear
to
me
it
is
the
great
grief
of
my
life
that
owing
to
matters
beyond
my
control
i
have
been
unable
to
care
for
them
as
i
should
like
to
do
this
being
the
case
i
have
been
obliged
to
allow
them
to
accept
many
favors
from
my
only
sister
octavia
this
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
not
be
repugnant
to
my
pride
but
my
sister
is
a
very
unusual
person
she
must
do
for
my
children
in
her
own
way
and
while
i
was
prepared
in
agreeing
that
they
should
accept
her
bounty
for
some
whimsical
manifestation
of
her
eccentric
character
i
did
not
imagine
that
she
would
go
so
far
as
to
shut
me
out
from
all
knowledge
of
her
plans
for
them
that
ames
is
what
has
happened
his
voice
rose
and
fell
mournfully
he
puffed
his
pipe
for
a
moment
and
continued
cecilia
being
the
older
was
to
be
launched
first
hezekiah
was
to
be
cared
for
in
due
season
last
summer
octavia
took
them
both
abroad
as
you
are
aware
they
are
young
women
of
unusual
distinction
of
appearance
and
manner
and
they
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
from
what
i
hear
a
troop
of
suitors
followed
them
about
that
sort
of
thing
would
appeal
to
octavia
to
me
it
is
most
repellent
but
i
had
already
committed
myself
agreeing
that
octavia
should
manage
in
her
own
fashion
there
is
now
something
forward
here
which
i
do
not
understand
i
have
an
idea
that
octavia
has
contrived
some
preposterous
scheme
for
choosing
a
husband
for
cecilia
that
is
in
keeping
with
her
odd
fashion
of
transacting
all
her
business
i
do
not
know
its
nature
and
by
the
terms
of
her
agreement
cecilia
is
not
to
disclose
the
method
to
be
employed
to
me
not
even
to
me
her
own
father
you
must
agree
ames
that
that
is
rather
rubbing
it
in
but
you
do
assume
that
your
daughter
is
not
to
be
a
free
agent
in
the
matter
you
do
believe
that
some
unworthy
and
improper
man
is
to
be
forced
upon
her
that
sir
is
exactly
what
i
fear
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
can
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
miss
hollister
would
risk
her
niece
happiness
even
to
satisfy
her
own
peculiar
humor
your
sister
is
a
shrewd
woman
and
her
heart
i
am
convinced
is
the
kindest
among
the
suitors
now
camped
at
the
prescott
arms
there
must
be
some
one
whom
your
daughter
approves
and
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
ultimately
be
her
choice
now
that
you
have
broached
the
matter
i
make
free
to
say
that
one
of
these
suitors
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
hartley
wiggins
by
name
and
that
he
is
a
man
of
the
highest
character
and
a
gentleman
in
the
strictest
sense
he
had
been
listening
to
me
with
the
greatest
composure
but
at
the
mention
of
wiggins
name
he
started
and
nervously
clutched
my
arm
that
man
may
be
all
that
you
say
he
cried
chokingly
but
he
has
acted
infamously
toward
both
my
daughters
he
is
a
rogue
and
a
most
despicable
fellow
he
has
flirted
outrageously
with
hezekiah
while
at
the
same
time
pretending
to
be
deeply
interested
in
cecilia
i
say
to
you
in
all
candor
that
a
man
who
will
trifle
with
the
affections
of
a
child
like
hezekiah
is
a
villain
nothing
less
but
my
dear
sir
is
it
not
possible
that
you
do
him
a
great
wrong
may
it
not
be
the
other
way
round
that
hezekiah
is
trifling
with
wiggins
affections
he
a
splendid
fellow
hartley
wiggins
but
he
a
little
slow
that
all
and
between
two
superb
young
women
like
your
daughters
a
man
may
be
pardoned
for
doubts
and
hesitations
a
case
of
being
happy
with
either
if
dear
charmer
were
only
away
to
put
it
quite
concretely
i
will
say
that
in
my
own
very
slight
acquaintance
with
these
young
women
i
feel
the
spell
of
both
your
sister
i
take
it
is
anxious
not
to
show
partiality
for
any
of
these
men
and
yet
i
dare
say
she
probably
feels
kindly
disposed
toward
wiggins
his
worst
crime
seems
to
be
that
he
chose
tory
ancestors
the
thing
is
bound
to
straighten
itself
out
he
tossed
his
head
impatiently
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
octavia
interest
in
this
hartley
wiggins
may
be
due
to
a
trifling
and
immaterial
fact
nothing
beyond
his
indubitable
eligibility
then
let
me
tell
you
what
i
suspect
both
his
names
contain
seven
letters
my
sister
is
slightly
cracked
as
to
the
number
seven
i
swear
to
you
my
belief
that
the
fact
that
his
names
contain
seven
letters
each
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
incredible
my
dear
sir
but
wholly
possible
then
such
being
the
case
why
does
she
show
her
hand
openly
if
she
believes
that
wiggins
with
his
septenary
names
is
ordained
by
the
seven
original
pleiades
to
marry
your
daughter
cecilia
i
should
think
that
by
the
same
token
she
would
have
sought
a
man
rejoicing
in
the
noble
name
of
septimus
you
send
conjecture
far
when
once
you
entertain
so
absurd
an
idea
you
think
my
assumption
unlikely
he
asked
eagerly
i
certainly
do
hollister
but
i
confess
that
i
had
never
counted
the
letters
in
wiggins
name
before
and
your
suggestion
is
interesting
and
this
whole
idea
of
the
potential
seven
in
our
affairs
has
possibilities
if
seven
at
all
why
is
it
possible
that
your
sister
has
jacob
in
mind
and
the
seven
years
he
served
for
rachel
you
may
as
well
assume
that
as
wiggins
is
specially
favored
in
the
number
of
letters
in
his
singularly
prosaic
and
unromantic
name
it
is
miss
hollister
plan
to
keep
him
dallying
seven
years
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
forced
me
back
against
the
battlements
then
stood
off
and
eyed
me
fiercely
you
speak
of
serving
and
of
service
will
you
tell
me
just
why
you
are
here
and
what
brings
you
into
this
affair
my
daughter
hezekiah
is
the
frankest
person
alive
and
she
told
me
of
her
meetings
with
you
and
that
you
had
been
to
the
asolando
where
she
spent
a
day
in
the
sheerest
spirit
of
mischief
that
was
the
beginning
of
all
our
troubles
that
damned
hole
with
its
insane
confectionery
and
poetry
if
cecilia
in
a
misguided
notion
of
earning
her
own
living
had
not
gone
there
and
worn
an
apron
for
a
week
before
i
dragged
her
out
she
would
never
have
met
wiggins
and
now
will
you
kindly
tell
me
just
what
you
are
doing
in
my
sister
house
where
i
have
to
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
to
see
one
of
my
own
children
this
fierce
deliverance
touched
me
nearly
i
doubted
my
ability
to
explain
to
one
of
these
amazing
hollisters
just
how
i
came
to
be
sojourning
in
the
house
of
another
of
the
family
without
any
business
that
would
bear
scrutiny
i
hastened
to
declare
my
profession
and
that
i
had
been
summoned
by
miss
hollister
to
examine
her
chimneys
i
could
not
however
tell
him
that
until
my
arrival
the
chimneys
had
behaved
themselves
admirably
you
admitted
your
friendship
for
this
wiggins
person
enough
he
said
when
i
had
concluded
i
advise
you
to
leave
the
house
at
once
i
tell
you
he
got
to
be
eliminated
from
the
situation
understand
that
i
do
not
threaten
you
with
violence
but
i
will
not
promise
to
abstain
from
visiting
heavy
punishment
upon
that
fellow
and
you
a
i
am
a
man
of
considerable
knowledge
of
the
world
and
i
say
to
you
very
candidly
that
i
believe
there
is
any
such
profession
then
let
me
tell
you
i
replied
not
without
heat
that
i
am
a
graduate
in
architecture
and
that
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
consult
a
list
of
the
alumni
of
the
institute
of
technology
you
will
find
that
i
was
graduated
there
not
without
credit
and
as
for
remaining
in
this
house
i
beg
to
inform
you
hollister
that
as
i
am
your
sister
guest
and
as
she
is
perfectly
competent
to
manage
her
own
affairs
i
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
it
pleases
her
to
ask
me
to
remain
and
now
one
other
matter
how
did
you
gain
this
roof
when
by
your
own
admission
you
are
not
on
such
terms
with
your
sister
as
would
justify
you
in
entering
it
openly
the
moonlight
did
not
fail
to
convey
the
contempt
in
his
face
but
i
thought
he
grinned
as
he
answered
quietly
you
do
seem
to
understand
young
man
that
you
are
entitled
to
no
explanations
from
me
if
my
sister
has
her
sense
of
a
joke
i
assure
you
that
i
have
mine
i
came
here
to
see
my
daughter
as
i
taught
her
to
fence
when
she
was
ten
years
old
and
as
she
is
particularly
expert
and
moreover
as
in
my
present
condition
of
poverty
i
have
been
obliged
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
metropolitan
life
and
to
give
up
my
membership
in
the
fencers
club
you
can
hardly
deny
my
right
to
meet
my
own
daughter
for
a
brief
bout
anywhere
i
please
you
strike
me
as
a
singularly
fresh
young
person
it
would
be
a
positive
grief
to
me
to
feel
that
my
conduct
had
displeased
you
and
now
as
the
night
grows
chill
i
shall
beg
you
to
precede
me
into
the
house
by
the
way
you
came
but
first
i
persisted
let
me
ask
a
question
it
is
possible
that
you
yourself
have
some
preference
among
your
daughter
several
suitors
hollister
would
you
object
to
telling
me
which
one
you
would
choose
for
miss
cecilia
beyond
question
the
man
for
cecilia
if
i
have
any
voice
in
the
matter
is
lord
arrowood
arrowood
i
exclaimed
you
surprise
me
greatly
i
saw
him
at
the
inn
and
he
seemed
to
me
the
most
insignificant
and
uninteresting
one
of
the
lot
that
proves
you
a
person
of
poor
gifts
of
discernment
ames
and
his
tone
and
manner
were
quite
reminiscent
of
his
sister
ways
and
his
further
explanation
proved
him
even
more
worthily
the
brother
of
his
sister
as
i
was
obliged
he
began
owing
to
an
unfortunate
physical
handicap
to
abandon
my
art
that
of
a
marine
painter
i
have
given
my
attention
for
a
number
of
years
to
the
study
of
the
irish
situation
between
the
various
political
parties
of
great
britain
poor
ireland
can
never
regain
her
ancient
power
but
i
see
no
reason
why
she
should
not
become
once
more
a
free
and
independent
nation
i
have
gone
deeply
into
irish
history
and
i
may
modestly
say
that
i
probably
know
that
history
from
the
time
of
the
invasion
to
the
death
of
gladstone
better
than
any
other
living
man
i
met
arrowood
by
chance
in
the
highway
yesterday
and
i
found
that
he
holds
exactly
my
ideas
but
arrowood
is
an
irishman
i
interjected
neither
i
should
say
are
you
that
not
to
the
point
neither
was
napoleon
a
frenchman
strictly
speaking
nor
was
lafayette
an
american
a
friend
of
mine
in
wall
street
is
ready
when
the
time
is
ripe
to
finance
the
scheme
by
selling
bonds
to
the
multitudes
of
irish
throughout
the
united
states
most
of
whom
are
not
unknown
to
the
banks
and
i
suppose
you
and
arrowood
would
sit
jointly
in
the
seat
of
the
ancient
kings
in
dublin
after
you
had
effected
your
you
lose
your
bet
ames
we
have
agreed
that
as
the
mayors
of
boston
for
many
years
have
been
irishmen
and
as
they
have
by
their
prowess
in
holding
the
natives
in
subordination
demonstrated
the
highest
political
sagacity
we
could
not
do
better
than
take
one
of
these
rulers
of
the
old
puritan
capital
and
place
him
on
the
irish
throne
the
keen
humor
of
that
move
would
so
tickle
all
interested
powers
that
the
investiture
and
coronation
of
the
new
ruler
would
be
accomplished
without
firing
a
shot
this
certainly
had
the
true
hollister
touch
miss
octavia
herself
could
not
have
devised
a
more
delightful
scheme
and
so
bassford
hollister
concluded
i
naturally
incline
toward
arrowood
though
he
is
so
poor
that
he
was
obliged
to
come
over
in
the
steerage
to
continue
his
wooing
of
my
daughter
he
let
himself
down
into
the
dark
waited
for
me
courteously
and
walked
by
my
side
to
the
stairway
both
of
us
maintaining
silence
i
was
deeply
curious
to
know
how
he
had
entered
and
whether
he
expected
to
go
down
the
front
way
and
out
the
main
door
we
kept
together
to
the
hall
i
could
have
sworn
to
that
then
suddenly
just
as
we
reached
the
stairway
out
went
the
lights
and
we
were
in
utter
darkness
i
smothered
an
exclamation
clutched
my
matches
and
struck
a
light
and
as
the
stick
flamed
slowly
i
looked
about
for
bassford
hollister
but
he
had
vanished
as
suddenly
and
completely
as
though
a
trap
had
yawned
beneath
us
and
swallowed
him
i
found
the
switch
and
it
responded
immediately
flooding
the
to
the
lower
hall
but
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
more
of
hollister
astounded
by
this
performance
i
continued
on
to
the
lower
floor
to
have
a
look
around
and
there
calmly
reading
by
the
library
table
sat
miss
octavia
late
hours
mr
ames
she
cried
i
supposed
you
had
retired
long
ago
i
was
still
the
least
bit
ruffled
by
that
last
transaction
on
the
stair
and
i
demanded
a
little
curtly
pardon
my
troubling
you
but
may
i
inquire
miss
hollister
how
long
you
have
been
sitting
here
the
clock
on
the
stair
began
to
strike
twelve
and
she
listened
composedly
to
a
few
of
the
strokes
before
replying
just
half
an
hour
i
thought
some
one
knocked
at
my
door
about
an
hour
ago
the
lights
were
on
and
i
came
down
saw
a
magazine
that
had
escaped
my
eye
before
and
here
you
find
me
some
one
knocked
at
your
door
i
thought
so
you
know
the
servants
have
an
idea
that
the
place
is
haunted
and
i
thought
that
if
i
sat
here
the
ghost
might
take
it
upon
himself
to
walk
i
confess
to
a
slight
disappointment
that
it
is
only
you
who
have
appeared
i
suppose
it
was
you
who
knocked
at
my
door
no
i
replied
laughing
a
little
at
her
manner
not
unless
it
was
you
who
switched
off
the
lights
as
i
was
coming
down
from
the
fourth
floor
i
have
been
studying
this
chimney
from
the
roof
i
know
something
of
the
ways
of
electric
switches
and
they
do
usually
move
of
their
own
accord
your
coming
to
this
house
has
been
the
greatest
joy
to
me
ames
i
should
not
have
imagined
in
a
chance
look
at
you
that
you
were
psychical
and
yet
such
is
clearly
the
fact
i
assure
you
that
i
have
not
touched
any
switch
since
i
left
my
room
it
was
unnecessary
as
i
found
the
lights
on
and
i
acquit
you
of
rapping
rapping
at
my
it
gives
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
assume
that
the
house
is
haunted
and
at
any
time
you
find
the
ghost
i
beg
that
you
will
lose
no
time
in
presenting
me
if
the
prowler
is
indeed
one
of
king
george
soldiers
hanged
during
the
revolution
on
the
site
of
this
house
i
should
like
to
have
words
with
him
i
have
just
been
reading
an
article
on
the
political
corruption
in
philadelphia
in
this
magazine
it
bears
every
evidence
of
truth
but
if
half
of
it
is
fiction
i
still
feel
that
as
an
american
citizen
though
denied
the
inalienable
right
of
representation
assured
me
in
the
constitution
we
owe
that
ghost
an
apology
for
certainly
nothing
was
gained
by
throwing
off
the
british
yoke
and
that
poor
soldier
died
in
a
worthy
cause
she
wore
a
remarkable
lavender
and
a
such
as
i
had
never
seen
outside
a
museum
as
she
concluded
her
speech
spoken
in
that
curious
lilting
tone
which
from
the
beginning
had
left
me
in
doubt
as
to
the
seriousness
of
all
her
statements
she
rose
and
still
clasping
her
magazine
made
me
a
courtesy
and
was
soon
mounting
the
stair
i
heard
her
door
close
a
minute
later
and
then
feeling
that
i
had
earned
the
right
to
repose
i
went
to
my
room
and
to
bed
xi
i
play
truant
i
slept
late
and
on
going
down
found
the
table
set
in
the
a
pleasant
inadvertence
marked
the
choice
of
at
hopefield
manor
i
was
never
quite
sure
where
i
should
find
a
table
spread
no
one
was
about
and
i
was
seized
with
that
mild
form
of
panic
familiar
to
the
guest
who
finds
himself
late
to
a
meal
as
i
paused
uncertainly
in
the
door
viewing
the
table
set
i
noticed
for
only
one
person
miss
octavia
entered
briskly
her
slight
figure
concealed
by
a
prodigious
gingham
apron
merry
gentleman
she
began
blithely
the
most
delightful
thing
has
happened
without
the
slightest
warning
without
the
faintest
intimation
of
their
dissatisfaction
the
have
departed
with
the
single
exception
of
my
personal
maid
who
being
a
swede
and
therefore
singularly
devoid
of
emotion
was
unshaken
by
the
that
have
sent
the
rest
of
my
staff
scampering
over
the
hills
she
lighted
the
lamp
in
her
most
tranquil
fashion
and
begged
me
to
be
seated
i
have
already
breakfasted
she
continued
and
cecilia
is
even
now
preparing
you
an
omelet
with
her
own
hand
i
beg
to
reassure
you
as
my
guest
that
the
of
the
servants
causes
me
not
the
slightest
annoyance
from
reading
the
comic
papers
you
may
have
gained
an
impression
that
the
loss
of
servants
is
a
tragic
business
in
any
household
but
nothing
so
petty
can
disturb
me
cecilia
is
an
excellent
cook
and
i
myself
shall
not
starve
so
long
as
i
have
strength
to
crack
an
egg
or
lift
a
and
besides
i
still
retain
my
early
trust
in
providence
i
do
not
doubt
that
before
nightfall
a
corps
of
excellent
servants
will
again
be
on
duty
here
very
likely
they
are
even
now
bound
for
this
place
coming
from
the
wet
coasts
of
ireland
from
liverpool
from
lonely
villages
in
scandinavia
the
average
woman
would
merely
fret
herself
into
a
sanatorium
if
confronted
with
the
problem
i
face
this
morning
but
i
hope
you
will
testify
in
future
to
the
fact
that
i
faced
this
day
in
the
cheeriest
and
most
hopeful
spirit
not
only
shall
i
do
so
miss
hollister
i
replied
trying
to
catch
her
own
note
but
it
will
throughout
my
life
give
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
to
set
your
cause
aright
to
that
extent
let
me
be
horatio
to
your
hamlet
thank
you
milord
she
returned
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
may
i
say
further
that
the
incident
gives
the
stamp
of
authenticity
to
my
ghost
i
was
obliged
to
pay
those
people
double
wages
to
lure
them
from
the
felicities
of
the
city
and
they
must
have
been
a
good
deal
alarmed
to
have
left
so
precipitately
you
must
excuse
me
now
as
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
do
the
work
this
morning
that
individual
having
fled
with
the
rest
and
it
being
incumbent
on
me
to
maintain
my
in
this
property
to
make
a
dozen
pies
before
high
noon
but
first
i
must
visit
the
stables
where
i
believe
the
coachman
still
lingers
having
been
prevented
from
joining
the
stampede
of
the
by
the
painful
twinges
of
gout
with
this
she
left
me
and
i
began
pecking
at
a
it
had
been
in
my
mind
as
i
dressed
that
morning
to
play
truant
and
visit
the
city
it
was
almost
imperative
that
i
take
a
look
at
my
office
and
i
had
resolved
upon
a
plan
which
would
i
believed
give
me
the
key
to
the
ghost
mystery
if
pepperton
had
built
that
house
he
must
know
whether
he
had
contrived
any
secret
passages
that
would
afford
exits
and
entrances
not
apparent
to
the
eye
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
run
into
the
city
explain
myself
to
my
assistant
and
get
hold
of
pepperton
my
mind
was
made
up
and
i
had
even
consulted
a
and
chosen
one
of
the
express
trains
as
i
sat
at
the
table
absorbed
in
my
plans
for
the
day
my
nerves
received
a
sudden
shock
i
had
heard
no
one
enter
yet
a
voice
at
my
shoulder
murmured
casually
hast
thou
seen
ghosts
hast
thou
at
midnight
heard
it
was
the
voice
of
hezekiah
i
knew
before
i
faced
her
she
wore
a
blue
with
a
broad
red
ribbon
tied
under
the
collar
and
a
blue
tam
o
shanter
capped
her
head
she
bore
a
tray
that
contained
my
omelet
a
plate
of
toast
and
other
sundries
incidental
to
a
substantial
breakfast
which
she
distributed
deftly
upon
the
table
how
did
you
get
here
i
blurted
my
nerves
still
out
of
control
the
kitchen
door
sir
i
had
ridden
into
the
garden
and
seeing
aunt
octavia
heading
for
the
stables
and
cecilia
at
the
kitchen
window
i
pedaled
boldly
in
cecilia
wanted
to
borrow
my
bicycle
and
being
a
good
little
sister
i
gave
it
to
her
she
also
said
that
you
required
food
so
i
told
her
to
go
and
i
would
carry
you
your
breakfast
i
shall
skip
myself
in
a
minute
you
may
draw
your
own
coffee
mind
the
machine
it
tips
if
you
are
careful
she
went
to
the
window
and
peered
out
toward
the
stables
may
i
ask
daughter
of
kings
where
your
sister
has
gone
so
suddenly
certainly
she
off
for
town
to
chase
a
cook
and
a
few
other
people
to
run
this
hotel
i
heard
at
the
that
the
whole
camp
had
deserted
so
i
ran
over
to
see
what
was
doing
and
just
for
that
i
got
to
walk
home
but
your
aunt
said
that
providence
would
take
care
of
the
servant
question
she
expected
a
whole
corps
of
ideal
servants
to
come
straying
in
during
the
day
hezekiah
laughed
it
is
not
right
for
any
girl
to
be
as
pretty
as
hezekiah
or
to
laugh
as
musically
she
told
me
to
sit
down
and
as
i
did
so
she
passed
the
toast
and
helped
herself
to
a
slice
into
which
she
set
her
fine
white
teeth
neatly
watching
me
with
the
merriest
of
twinkles
in
her
brown
eyes
cecilia
has
aunt
octavia
confidence
in
providence
so
she
taking
a
shot
at
the
employment
agencies
she
has
left
a
note
on
the
kitchen
table
to
inform
aunt
octavia
that
she
had
forgotten
an
engagement
with
the
dentist
and
has
gone
to
catch
the
that
hezekiah
is
a
lie
it
is
quite
square
to
deceive
your
aunt
that
way
i
remarked
soberly
hezekiah
laughed
again
you
absurdity
do
you
know
aunt
octavia
yet
she
will
be
perfectly
overjoyed
when
she
comes
back
and
finds
that
note
from
cecilia
she
likes
disappearances
mysteries
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
it
is
barely
possible
that
you
will
have
to
wash
the
dishes
i
ca
you
see
for
i
not
supposed
to
come
on
the
reservation
at
all
not
until
cecilia
has
found
a
husband
is
it
perfectly
delicious
all
of
that
daughter
of
kings
i
think
that
as
soon
as
i
can
regain
confidence
in
my
own
sanity
i
shall
like
it
myself
but
and
i
watched
her
narrowly
you
see
hezekiah
there
is
really
a
ghost
you
know
once
more
that
divine
mirth
in
her
bubbled
mellowly
she
had
walked
guardedly
to
the
window
and
turned
swiftly
with
a
mockery
of
fear
in
her
face
aunt
octavia
approaches
and
i
must
be
off
but
that
ghost
when
you
find
him
please
let
me
know
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
want
to
ask
some
reliable
ghost
about
the
hereafter
with
this
she
fled
and
i
heard
the
front
door
close
smartly
after
her
an
instant
later
miss
octavia
appeared
and
asked
solicitously
how
i
liked
my
omelette
the
coachman
has
been
telling
me
a
capital
he
believes
them
to
be
beneficent
and
declares
that
he
will
under
no
circumstances
leave
my
employment
she
sat
down
and
folded
her
arms
upon
the
table
for
the
first
time
i
believed
that
she
was
serious
there
was
in
fact
a
troubled
look
on
her
sweet
whimsical
face
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
loss
of
her
servants
was
not
really
the
slight
matter
she
had
previously
made
of
it
ames
will
you
pardon
me
for
asking
you
a
question
of
the
most
intimate
character
it
is
only
after
much
hesitation
that
i
do
so
i
bowed
encouragingly
my
curiosity
fully
aroused
you
may
ask
me
anything
in
the
world
miss
hollister
then
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
whether
i
ca
express
the
dislike
i
feel
in
doing
this
but
can
you
tell
me
whether
you
have
seen
in
the
hands
of
my
niece
cecilia
a
small
a
very
small
yes
i
have
i
answered
greatly
surprised
and
may
i
ask
whether
and
again
i
must
plead
my
deep
concern
as
an
excuse
for
making
such
an
inquiry
whether
you
by
any
chance
saw
her
making
any
notation
in
that
book
i
recalled
the
book
perfectly
but
had
attached
no
importance
to
it
but
if
cecilia
fortunes
were
so
intimately
related
to
it
as
miss
hollister
manner
implied
i
felt
that
i
must
be
careful
of
my
answer
i
was
trying
to
recall
the
precise
moment
at
which
i
had
entered
the
library
the
preceding
evening
after
hume
departure
and
while
i
was
intent
upon
this
my
silence
must
have
been
prolonged
i
felt
obliged
to
make
an
answer
of
some
sort
and
yet
i
did
not
relish
the
thought
of
conveying
information
that
might
distress
and
embarrass
a
noble
girl
like
cecilia
hollister
something
in
my
face
must
have
conveyed
a
hint
of
this
inner
conflict
to
miss
hollister
for
she
rose
suddenly
holding
up
her
hand
as
though
to
silence
me
she
seemed
deeply
moved
and
cried
in
agitation
do
not
answer
me
the
question
was
quite
unfair
quite
unfair
and
yet
i
assure
you
that
at
the
moment
i
made
the
inquiry
i
felt
justified
she
retreated
toward
the
door
as
i
rose
and
then
with
her
composure
fully
restored
she
courtesied
gracefully
luncheon
here
will
be
a
buffet
affair
as
i
shall
be
engaged
with
matters
of
pastry
i
sure
however
that
you
will
find
employment
until
when
my
house
will
be
fully
in
order
again
i
intended
that
this
should
be
a
busy
day
so
without
making
explanations
i
went
to
the
stable
told
the
coachman
i
wished
to
be
driven
to
the
station
and
was
soon
whizzing
over
the
hills
toward
katonah
the
coachman
an
irishman
introduced
the
subject
of
the
ghost
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
of
the
house
the
ole
lady
dipped
she
dipped
sir
he
remarked
leadingly
it
catching
i
answered
so
you
better
forget
it
he
thereupon
settled
glumly
to
his
driving
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
near
where
i
had
first
encountered
hezekiah
in
the
i
spied
her
trudging
across
a
meadow
and
she
waved
her
hand
gaily
meadows
and
streams
and
stars
of
such
were
hezekiah
kingdom
i
wondered
how
wiggins
and
the
other
gentlemen
at
the
prescott
arms
were
faring
my
question
was
partially
answered
a
second
later
as
we
passed
the
road
that
forked
off
to
the
inn
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
sat
lord
arrowood
desolately
guarding
a
and
a
he
was
dressed
in
a
shabby
norfolk
jacket
and
knickerbockers
and
sucked
a
pipe
illustration
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
sat
lord
arrowood
i
bade
the
driver
pause
and
greeted
the
nobleman
affably
can
i
give
you
a
lift
you
seem
to
be
bound
for
the
station
and
taking
a
train
myself
no
thanks
he
replied
sharply
they
a
lot
of
bounders
bounders
i
say
ah
of
whom
do
you
speak
lord
arrowood
i
asked
glancing
at
my
watch
those
scoundrels
at
the
inn
they
have
thrown
me
out
thrown
me
out
me
hard
lines
for
a
fact
but
if
you
are
interested
in
trains
i
refuse
to
leave
the
county
he
shouted
if
they
think
going
to
get
rid
of
me
they
mistaken
bounders
i
say
bounders
he
uttered
this
opprobrious
term
with
great
bitterness
and
crossed
his
legs
as
though
to
emphasize
his
permanence
upon
the
boulder
patience
on
a
monument
is
not
more
eternally
planted
he
seemed
in
no
mood
for
conversation
so
i
sped
on
with
no
time
to
lose
i
gained
the
step
of
the
attached
to
the
with
some
loss
of
dignity
the
porter
yanking
me
aboard
under
the
conductor
scornful
eye
the
katonah
passengers
were
still
in
the
aisle
and
as
i
surveyed
them
i
saw
cecilia
take
a
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
car
she
was
just
unfolding
a
newspaper
when
i
moved
to
a
seat
behind
her
and
bade
her
the
look
she
gave
me
in
turning
round
had
in
it
something
of
quizzical
humor
this
interested
me
because
i
had
not
previously
seen
any
but
the
most
superficial
resemblance
between
the
sisters
her
cheeks
were
aglow
from
her
sprint
on
the
wheel
the
short
skirt
and
the
shirt
waist
are
the
true
vesture
of
emancipated
woman
cecilia
hollister
whose
apparel
at
home
had
struck
me
as
rather
formal
seemed
this
morning
quite
a
new
being
she
drew
a
folded
veil
from
the
pocket
of
her
jacket
removed
her
hat
and
pinned
the
veil
to
it
she
kept
the
hat
in
her
lap
however
and
went
on
talking
we
are
both
truants
you
must
have
breakfasted
in
a
hurry
to
have
caught
this
train
not
at
all
i
enjoyed
a
brief
conversation
with
your
sister
and
after
she
had
gone
your
aunt
came
back
and
lingered
for
a
moment
she
told
you
i
suppose
that
providence
would
look
after
the
servant
question
she
did
just
that
well
providence
is
hardly
equal
to
getting
enough
servants
to
run
that
place
so
i
going
to
assist
providence
a
little
you
become
the
vicaress
of
providence
i
admire
your
spirit
it
mere
aunt
octavia
would
have
me
chained
to
the
kitchen
if
i
did
do
something
about
it
she
had
permitted
me
to
settle
with
the
conductor
and
when
i
had
completed
this
transaction
i
found
that
she
had
drawn
from
her
purse
the
little
silver
booklet
about
which
miss
octavia
had
inquired
so
anxiously
she
held
this
close
to
her
eyes
so
that
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
silver
backs
on
one
of
which
was
engraved
in
neat
script
the
subjoined
pencil
she
held
poised
ready
for
use
touching
the
tip
of
it
to
her
tongue
she
raised
her
eyes
with
the
look
still
in
them
can
you
tell
me
how
to
spell
arrowood
is
it
one
or
two
w
one
i
think
the
noble
lord
uses
she
seemed
to
write
the
name
and
i
saw
her
counting
on
her
fingers
touching
them
lightly
on
the
open
page
of
the
book
then
she
dropped
it
into
her
purse
which
she
thrust
back
carefully
into
her
pocket
she
sighed
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
we
were
passing
a
series
of
huge
signs
built
like
a
barricade
along
the
right
of
way
and
on
one
of
these
i
observed
with
fresh
interest
an
advertisement
whose
counterpart
i
had
seen
often
about
new
york
but
without
ever
observing
it
attentively
it
drew
a
laugh
from
me
now
it
represented
an
infant
in
a
perambulator
behind
which
stood
the
effigy
of
a
capped
and
aproned
nurse
a
legend
was
inscribed
on
the
board
to
this
effect
hush
baby
asleep
it
a
hollister
perambulator
if
it
a
hollister
i
remarked
as
a
second
of
these
flew
by
the
window
it
perfect
oh
those
things
she
exclaimed
i
was
referring
to
the
perambulator
necessarily
anything
hollister
must
be
good
we
out
of
the
business
except
that
aunt
octavia
gets
a
dollar
for
every
one
that
made
but
the
trust
keeps
the
name
the
trust
could
hardly
change
your
name
you
will
have
to
do
that
yourself
you
been
talking
to
hezekiah
that
the
way
people
always
talk
to
her
it
certainly
not
the
way
i
been
talking
to
you
but
we
run
away
from
school
and
i
disposed
to
make
the
most
of
it
our
conversation
at
your
aunt
has
been
so
high
up
in
the
air
that
pleasant
to
come
down
to
earth
and
tune
it
to
the
less
strenuous
note
of
a
railway
journey
that
ames
may
depend
upon
the
point
of
view
but
you
will
make
it
yours
wo
you
you
see
i
always
dreamed
of
adventures
but
since
i
met
your
aunt
in
the
asolando
they
been
coming
a
little
too
fast
there
that
ghost
business
now
i
going
to
catch
that
ghost
if
it
the
last
thing
i
do
well
i
not
the
ghost
and
neither
is
my
father
if
that
what
in
your
mind
tell
me
just
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
i
gave
her
the
story
in
detail
and
my
recital
seemed
to
amuse
her
greatly
you
thought
it
was
aunt
octavia
herself
at
first
then
you
thought
i
was
the
spook
and
now
you
are
not
fully
persuaded
that
it
is
not
my
father
i
will
take
you
into
my
confidence
this
far
that
i
do
know
how
father
got
into
the
house
last
night
he
wrote
a
note
asking
me
to
meet
him
on
the
roof
and
bring
the
foils
that
was
not
unlike
him
as
he
is
the
dearest
father
in
the
world
and
his
whims
are
just
as
jolly
in
their
way
as
aunt
octavia
i
was
sure
that
aunt
octavia
had
retired
for
the
night
so
i
changed
my
dress
and
carried
the
foils
up
through
the
i
had
hardly
reached
there
before
my
father
appeared
the
whole
situation
my
being
there
and
all
that
has
distressed
father
a
great
deal
so
i
let
you
see
me
cry
a
little
i
promise
never
to
do
it
again
mirth
brightened
the
eyes
she
turned
upon
me
now
you
think
she
asked
that
those
lights
could
have
winked
out
twice
by
themselves
while
you
were
on
the
stairway
i
am
positive
of
it
and
somebody
a
being
of
some
sort
passed
me
on
the
stairway
it
might
imaginably
have
been
you
but
i
tell
you
positively
it
was
not
then
it
might
have
been
your
father
a
man
who
can
enter
a
house
at
will
might
easily
play
any
manner
of
other
tricks
his
disappearance
after
i
had
gone
down
into
the
house
with
him
was
just
as
mysterious
as
the
ghost
it
was
natural
for
father
not
to
want
you
to
know
how
he
got
in
the
motive
for
that
would
be
the
fact
that
he
is
not
supposed
to
see
me
or
communicate
with
me
in
any
way
but
you
got
to
get
a
i
think
i
have
one
i
said
then
all
the
rest
is
easy
to
whom
does
this
lead
you
i
need
hardly
say
for
it
must
have
occurred
to
you
that
there
is
one
member
of
the
hollister
family
we
have
mentioned
in
this
connection
if
you
mean
hezekiah
none
other
the
surprise
in
her
face
was
not
feigned
i
was
confident
of
this
and
the
questions
evoked
by
my
answer
at
once
danced
in
her
eyes
if
hezekiah
should
be
caught
in
the
house
just
now
we
should
all
pay
dearly
for
her
rashness
believe
me
this
is
true
some
day
you
may
know
the
whys
and
wherefores
at
present
no
one
may
know
there
is
this
however
if
hezekiah
or
my
father
should
be
found
at
hopefield
manor
anywhere
on
the
premises
while
i
am
there
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
more
so
than
i
dare
tell
you
but
why
should
hezekiah
wish
to
prowl
about
there
at
night
to
assume
for
a
moment
that
she
is
doing
it
her
manner
was
wholly
earnest
it
was
plain
that
she
had
entered
into
some
sort
of
a
compact
with
her
aunt
and
no
doubt
the
arrangement
was
in
the
characteristic
whimsical
vein
of
which
i
had
enjoyed
personal
experience
i
did
not
wish
to
press
cecilia
for
explanations
she
might
not
be
free
to
make
but
i
ventured
a
suggestion
or
two
hezekiah
may
be
entering
the
house
and
playing
ghost
for
amusement
merely
in
a
spirit
of
childish
rebellion
against
the
interdiction
that
forbids
her
the
house
that
is
quite
plausible
hezekiah
being
the
spirited
young
person
we
know
her
to
be
and
it
may
amuse
her
too
to
plug
the
chimneys
at
a
time
when
her
sister
is
enjoying
the
visits
of
suitors
without
quite
realizing
that
such
was
her
animus
she
may
be
the
least
the
very
least
bit
jealous
cecilia
flushed
and
her
eyes
flashed
indignantly
she
bent
toward
me
eagerly
please
do
not
say
such
a
thing
you
must
not
even
think
it
she
may
be
a
little
forlorn
alone
in
your
father
house
over
the
hills
at
times
when
you
are
surrounded
by
admirers
and
it
is
my
assumption
from
what
i
have
learned
in
one
way
and
another
of
your
flight
abroad
last
summer
that
some
of
these
gentlemen
now
established
at
the
prescott
arms
are
known
to
her
oh
all
of
them
certainly
and
hartley
wiggins
among
the
rest
that
ames
is
most
unkind
she
declared
earnestly
she
has
told
me
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
mr
wiggins
and
she
told
me
the
same
thing
but
i
do
not
feel
sure
of
it
but
what
if
she
is
you
are
not
really
interested
in
him
yourself
in
the
library
at
hopefield
manor
i
should
not
have
thought
of
speaking
to
cecilia
hollister
in
any
such
fashion
but
the
flying
train
gave
wings
to
my
daring
i
was
surprised
at
my
own
temerity
and
more
surprised
that
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
my
new
manner
of
speech
she
did
not
however
vouchsafe
any
reply
to
my
statement
but
changed
the
subject
abruptly
my
description
of
the
ghost
had
taken
considerable
time
and
we
were
now
running
through
the
tunnels
and
would
soon
be
at
the
end
of
our
journey
she
put
on
her
hat
and
veil
without
making
it
necessary
for
us
to
discontinue
our
talk
a
certain
languor
that
had
marked
her
at
her
aunt
vanished
there
was
a
clearer
light
in
her
eye
and
as
i
helped
her
into
her
coat
i
felt
that
here
was
a
woman
to
whose
high
qualities
i
had
done
scant
justice
i
count
on
finishing
my
errand
and
taking
the
she
remarked
that
a
short
time
to
allow
yourself
i
heard
that
it
a
dreary
business
chasing
the
employment
agencies
not
if
you
know
where
not
to
go
if
you
get
me
a
machine
of
some
sort
i
be
off
at
once
i
fear
i
sha
conclude
my
own
business
so
soon
but
if
you
will
honor
me
at
luncheon
this
last
was
at
the
door
of
a
taxicab
i
had
found
for
her
sorry
ames
but
it
out
of
the
question
i
hope
to
see
you
at
dinner
and
please
yes
miss
hollister
please
remember
that
you
are
aunt
octavia
guest
and
do
annoy
her
by
failing
to
appear
at
dinner
you
know
you
have
fixed
that
chimney
yet
her
smile
left
me
well
in
the
air
i
stood
staring
after
the
very
commonplace
cab
as
it
rolled
away
with
her
my
mind
a
whirling
chaos
of
emotion
the
crowd
jostled
me
impatiently
for
other
people
not
breathing
celestial
ether
from
an
hour
of
cecilia
hollister
society
were
bent
upon
the
day
business
i
set
off
at
once
for
pepperton
office
where
i
learned
that
the
architect
was
out
of
town
but
his
chief
clerk
greeted
me
courteously
i
told
him
frankly
that
i
wanted
to
look
at
the
plans
of
hopefield
manor
to
enable
me
to
learn
the
exact
lines
of
the
chimneys
he
confessed
surprise
that
they
were
causing
trouble
and
expressed
regret
that
they
were
not
in
the
office
miss
hollister
sent
for
them
this
morning
and
i
have
just
given
them
to
a
young
woman
who
bore
a
note
from
her
ordinarily
i
should
not
have
let
them
go
but
the
note
was
peremptory
and
miss
hollister
is
a
friend
of
pepperton
you
know
and
a
person
i
sure
he
would
not
refuse
we
at
work
now
on
plans
for
a
cathedral
she
proposes
building
for
the
bishop
of
manila
i
was
not
surprised
that
octavia
hollister
should
be
building
cathedrals
in
the
orient
i
was
beyond
that
but
i
was
taken
aback
to
find
that
she
had
anticipated
me
in
my
rush
for
the
plans
of
her
house
clearly
i
was
dealing
with
a
woman
who
was
not
only
immensely
amusing
but
exceedingly
shrewd
as
well
could
it
be
possible
after
all
that
she
was
herself
playing
ghost
merely
for
her
own
entertainment
she
was
capable
of
it
but
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
she
could
not
have
performed
the
tricks
of
which
i
had
been
the
victim
the
night
previous
unless
she
possessed
some
rare
vanishing
power
like
that
of
the
east
indian
mystics
may
i
ask
who
came
for
the
plans
i
judged
the
young
woman
to
be
a
maid
or
perhaps
she
was
miss
hollister
secretary
i
had
given
little
heed
during
my
short
stay
at
hopefield
manor
to
miss
hollister
personal
attendant
i
had
passed
her
in
the
halls
once
or
twice
a
young
woman
of
i
should
say
and
she
might
herself
be
the
ghost
now
that
i
thought
of
it
but
this
seemed
the
most
unlikely
hypothesis
possible
and
there
was
no
difficulty
in
accounting
for
her
flight
to
town
for
there
were
many
horses
and
vehicles
in
the
hopefield
stable
and
trains
were
frequent
if
there
is
anything
further
ames
i
roused
myself
to
find
the
chief
clerk
regarding
me
impatiently
and
i
thanked
him
and
hurried
away
at
my
own
office
my
assistant
pounced
upon
me
wrathfully
he
was
half
wild
over
the
pressure
of
vexatious
business
and
had
just
been
engaging
in
a
conversation
with
a
country
gentleman
at
lenox
which
had
left
him
in
bad
temper
i
was
explaining
to
him
the
seriousness
of
my
errands
at
hopefield
rather
unconvincingly
i
fear
and
the
fact
that
i
must
return
at
once
when
the
entered
my
private
room
to
say
that
three
gentlemen
wished
to
see
me
immediately
they
had
submitted
cards
but
had
refused
to
state
the
nature
of
their
business
it
was
with
a
distinct
sensation
of
surprise
that
i
read
the
names
respectively
of
percival
shallenberger
daniel
ormsby
and
john
stewart
dick
show
the
gentlemen
in
i
said
promptly
greatly
to
the
disgust
of
my
assistant
who
retired
to
deal
with
several
clients
whom
i
had
passed
in
the
fiercely
walking
the
floor
i
had
imagined
all
the
suitors
established
at
the
prescott
arms
as
the
three
appeared
clad
in
light
automobiling
coats
i
could
not
forbear
a
smile
at
their
grim
appearance
shallenberger
the
novelist
and
ormsby
the
manufacturer
were
big
men
dick
was
much
shorter
though
of
compact
and
sturdy
build
they
growled
surlily
in
response
to
my
greeting
and
ormsby
closed
the
door
behind
them
dick
seemed
to
be
the
designated
spokesman
and
he
advanced
to
the
desk
behind
which
i
sat
with
a
stride
and
manner
that
advertised
his
belligerent
frame
of
mind
ames
he
began
we
have
come
here
to
speak
for
ourselves
and
certain
other
gentlemen
who
are
staying
for
a
time
at
the
prescott
arms
gentlemen
of
the
committee
welcome
to
our
office
i
replied
greatly
amused
by
his
ferocity
my
tone
caused
the
others
to
draw
in
defensively
behind
him
we
want
you
to
understand
that
your
conduct
in
accompanying
a
lady
that
i
shall
not
name
to
the
city
is
an
act
we
can
not
pass
in
silence
your
conduct
in
going
to
hopefield
manor
was
in
itself
an
affront
to
us
but
your
behavior
this
morning
passes
all
bounds
we
have
come
sir
to
demand
an
explanation
at
a
glance
this
was
a
situation
i
dare
not
take
seriously
in
any
circumstances
the
fact
that
these
men
had
followed
me
to
my
office
to
rebuke
me
for
accompanying
cecilia
hollister
to
town
was
absurd
this
young
dick
was
absurd
in
himself
his
gray
cap
had
twisted
itself
oddly
to
the
side
of
his
head
and
a
bang
of
black
hair
lay
at
a
piratical
angle
across
his
forehead
behind
him
ormsby
the
man
tugged
at
a
brown
moustache
shallenberger
blue
eyes
snapped
wrathfully
dick
i
said
soberly
i
have
heard
of
you
as
the
original
pragmatist
of
nebraska
and
as
i
am
a
mere
ignorant
to
whom
the
later
philosophical
meaning
of
that
term
is
only
so
much
punk
i
must
identify
you
with
that
more
obvious
meaning
of
the
word
which
is
within
my
grasp
dick
and
gentlemen
of
the
committee
you
are
meddlesome
persons
meddlesome
cried
dick
heatedly
and
leaning
toward
me
across
my
desk
do
i
correctly
understand
sir
that
you
mean
to
insult
us
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
purpose
but
i
can
not
permit
you
to
imagine
that
i
going
to
allow
you
to
beard
me
in
my
office
and
criticise
my
conduct
in
regard
to
miss
cecilia
hollister
or
anybody
else
as
a
philosopher
from
the
fertile
of
nebraska
i
salute
you
with
admiration
as
a
critic
of
my
ways
and
manners
i
show
you
the
door
this
i
did
a
bit
jauntily
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
was
playing
my
part
well
but
the
young
man
before
me
seemed
to
swell
with
the
rage
that
surged
within
him
he
broke
out
furiously
beating
the
air
with
his
fist
you
not
only
insult
this
committee
but
you
speak
with
intentional
disrespect
of
my
native
state
and
of
the
great
philosophical
school
of
which
i
am
a
disciple
am
i
right
you
are
eminently
right
dick
neither
the
corn
the
philosophical
schools
nor
the
statistics
of
your
native
omaha
interest
me
a
particle
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
you
may
go
back
to
your
wigwam
on
the
tawny
missouri
as
soon
as
you
please
then
he
broke
forth
explosively
then
sir
by
minerva
pale
brow
and
by
all
the
gods
at
once
i
brand
you
put
the
brand
on
hot
little
one
make
it
a
good
strong
curse
while
you
about
it
he
choked
with
rage
for
a
moment
then
he
controlled
himself
with
painful
effort
my
personal
grievances
must
wait
continued
dick
brokenly
but
speaking
for
the
committee
i
wish
to
say
that
your
attentions
to
the
young
lady
whom
you
have
dared
sir
to
name
are
obnoxious
to
us
nothing
less
than
that
added
shallenberger
we
will
not
stand
for
it
growled
ormsby
heavy
bass
shallenberger
i
replied
evenly
as
a
member
of
the
great
hoosier
school
of
novelists
i
have
the
most
profound
respect
for
your
talents
my
is
dead
to
the
world
for
weeks
after
the
appearance
of
a
novel
from
your
pen
but
your
interference
in
my
private
affairs
is
beyond
all
reason
and
as
for
you
ormsby
i
dare
say
your
are
worthy
of
the
fame
of
the
utica
from
which
you
come
but
to
you
and
all
of
you
i
bid
defiance
i
return
to
hopefield
manor
by
the
express
i
rose
and
bowed
coldly
in
dismissal
but
the
trio
stood
their
ground
stubbornly
i
tell
you
sir
our
organization
is
complete
declared
dick
we
signed
a
gentleman
agreement
only
last
night
for
the
express
purpose
of
excluding
you
and
you
can
not
enter
as
a
competitor
you
are
only
an
outsider
and
we
do
intend
to
have
you
interfering
with
our
affairs
by
the
pink
left
ear
of
venus
i
blurted
is
it
a
trust
you
put
it
coarsely
ames
but
a
suitors
trust
then
if
i
read
the
newspapers
correctly
your
organization
is
against
public
policy
and
in
contravention
of
the
law
but
may
i
inquire
why
if
you
have
perfected
a
combination
of
miss
hollister
suitors
i
found
lord
arrowood
this
morning
sitting
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
evidently
in
the
greatest
dejection
can
it
be
possible
that
an
insurgent
has
crept
into
your
organization
and
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
regulars
we
ruled
him
out
shallenberger
burst
forth
because
he
was
a
foreigner
and
not
entitled
to
a
place
among
americans
that
is
one
reason
and
for
another
the
colors
of
his
were
an
offense
to
me
personally
and
for
another
reason
interposed
ormsby
he
had
no
money
with
which
to
pay
his
board
at
the
prescott
arms
for
this
just
cause
the
landlord
ejected
him
shortly
after
breakfast
this
morning
then
there
is
already
a
rift
in
the
lute
i
returned
no
trust
of
suitors
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
by
the
bloody
footprints
of
our
forefathers
on
the
snows
of
valley
forge
i
stand
for
the
right
of
the
american
girl
to
choose
where
she
will
you
may
perch
on
the
hills
about
hopefield
manor
and
besiege
cecilia
hollister
till
the
end
of
time
but
my
hand
is
raised
against
your
unrighteous
compact
and
i
am
in
the
fight
to
stay
go
back
to
the
prescott
arms
gentlemen
and
assure
your
associates
in
this
hideous
compact
of
my
most
distinguished
consideration
and
tell
them
to
go
to
the
devil
i
had
gone
to
the
parvenu
hotel
to
call
upon
a
washington
lady
who
had
been
making
life
a
burden
to
my
assistant
and
on
coming
out
into
fifth
avenue
shortly
after
one
bethought
me
of
the
asolando
my
interview
with
the
committee
of
the
suitors
had
driven
from
my
mind
practically
every
consideration
and
every
interest
not
centred
in
hopefield
manor
my
thoughts
turned
gratefully
to
the
asolando
where
only
a
few
days
ago
i
had
been
precipitated
into
the
strangest
adventures
my
eventless
life
had
known
a
strange
face
was
visible
at
the
cashier
desk
as
i
entered
the
i
passed
on
finding
the
place
quite
full
but
i
took
it
as
a
good
omen
that
the
seventh
table
from
the
right
was
unoccupied
and
i
hastily
appropriated
it
a
waitress
appeared
promptly
murmuring
there
are
no
birds
in
last
year
nest
and
recommended
a
sandwich
whose
contents
the
girl
told
me
were
secret
but
it
proved
to
be
wholly
palatable
as
i
drank
my
tea
and
ate
the
sandwich
i
surveyed
the
decorated
menu
card
with
interest
and
found
pleasurable
excitement
in
discovering
an
item
directing
attention
to
pickles
hezekiah
cents
the
delightful
hezekiah
must
then
have
impressed
herself
upon
the
ex
of
the
asolando
on
her
brief
day
there
thus
to
have
won
this
recognition
and
further
on
i
noted
among
the
desserts
with
even
greater
interest
and
satisfaction
miss
hollister
nieces
were
among
ten
thousand
young
women
and
it
was
quite
believable
that
their
brief
tenure
of
office
in
the
had
fixed
them
permanently
in
the
heart
of
the
unknown
proprietor
the
girl
at
the
was
reading
her
head
bent
as
demurely
as
hezekiah
had
been
on
that
memorable
afternoon
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
stranger
profile
i
tried
to
fancy
cecilia
in
cap
and
apron
serving
these
tables
but
my
imagination
was
not
equal
to
the
task
cecilia
occupied
my
mind
now
the
visit
of
the
furious
suitors
to
my
office
had
stirred
in
me
thoughts
and
aspirations
that
had
never
known
harborage
in
my
breast
before
the
presumption
of
those
fellows
had
exceeded
anything
i
had
known
in
my
contact
with
human
kind
and
instead
of
frightening
me
away
from
hopefield
manor
they
had
called
my
own
attention
to
the
strategic
importance
of
my
present
position
as
a
guest
in
miss
octavia
house
here
was
a
siege
of
suitors
indeed
but
i
was
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
my
position
within
the
barricade
as
these
thoughts
ran
through
my
mind
i
was
finishing
my
i
spurn
all
sweets
ordinarily
when
i
became
interested
in
the
unusual
conduct
of
a
young
woman
who
had
entered
the
front
door
briskly
and
walked
with
a
air
to
the
cashier
desk
the
girl
within
the
wicket
rose
promptly
opened
the
screen
and
without
parley
of
any
sort
emptied
the
contents
of
her
till
into
the
reticule
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
and
a
moment
careless
survey
of
the
room
the
girl
departed
swinging
the
reticule
in
her
hand
a
long
roll
she
carried
under
her
arm
confirmed
my
identification
it
was
miss
octavia
hollister
swedish
maid
and
the
roll
beyond
peradventure
contained
the
plans
she
had
obtained
at
office
the
girl
was
neat
of
figure
and
becomingly
gowned
and
as
i
watched
her
leave
the
shop
the
lightness
of
her
step
something
smooth
and
flowing
in
her
movements
interested
me
i
did
not
know
what
business
she
had
to
be
robbing
the
asolando
but
it
was
altogether
possible
that
she
was
the
hopefield
ghost
on
the
whole
when
i
had
finally
torn
myself
away
from
my
assistant
who
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
doubts
as
to
my
sanity
and
had
settled
myself
in
the
express
with
the
afternoon
papers
i
was
fully
satisfied
with
the
day
adventures
xii
the
riddle
of
the
sibyl
leaves
i
had
told
the
coachman
in
the
morning
not
to
trouble
to
meet
me
on
my
return
and
i
engaged
the
village
liveryman
to
drive
me
to
the
house
for
hire
as
we
approached
hopefield
i
saw
the
napoleonic
figure
of
john
stewart
dick
in
the
roadway
he
had
evidently
been
waiting
for
me
he
held
up
his
hand
with
the
superb
impersonal
scorn
of
a
fifth
avenue
policeman
and
the
driver
checked
his
horse
i
gave
you
warning
he
said
impressively
if
you
return
to
the
house
the
consequences
will
be
upon
your
own
head
thank
you
i
replied
courteously
you
lay
yourself
open
to
the
severest
penalties
of
the
law
in
attempting
to
intimidate
me
i
have
enlisted
for
the
whole
campaign
sick
chimneys
require
my
immediate
professional
attention
if
my
bark
sink
is
to
another
sea
be
good
dear
child
let
those
who
will
be
clever
and
kindly
omit
flowers
as
the
driver
slapped
his
reins
dick
sprang
out
of
the
way
muttering
words
that
proved
the
shallowness
of
his
philosophic
temper
the
liveryman
expressed
his
disapproval
of
the
pragmatist
in
profane
terms
as
we
entered
the
grounds
there
a
heap
o
talk
in
the
village
he
observed
they
do
say
the
old
lady
cracked
if
i
may
so
speak
of
her
and
that
there
ghosts
in
the
house
and
the
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
prescott
is
most
remarkable
the
word
passed
that
they
all
dippy
about
the
young
miss
hollister
that
lives
with
her
aunt
i
reckon
all
rich
people
are
a
bit
cracked
it
appears
to
go
with
the
money
bassford
hollister
he
the
old
lady
brother
he
just
as
bad
as
any
of
i
drove
in
these
parts
fifteen
year
and
i
worked
a
heap
for
the
rich
but
i
never
seen
nothin
like
the
hollisters
they
say
bassford
is
about
broke
now
had
his
share
of
the
money
and
blew
it
in
and
now
the
old
lady
marryin
off
the
girls
and
he
gets
no
money
out
of
her
if
he
takes
a
hand
in
that
game
she
it
to
suit
herself
that
bassford
is
always
up
to
somethin
queer
yesterday
he
sat
in
the
village
street
countin
the
number
of
people
he
saw
chewin
gum
hung
around
the
watchin
the
children
to
see
how
many
had
their
jaws
goin
takin
notes
just
like
the
census
man
and
tax
assessor
told
our
doctor
in
the
village
he
was
the
amount
of
the
american
people
put
into
every
year
and
expects
to
find
some
way
of
usin
it
to
run
machinery
it
harmless
doc
says
he
calls
it
just
the
hollister
idiosyncrasy
if
that
the
word
but
i
reckon
it
idiotsyncrasy
all
right
i
wish
you
good
luck
of
your
place
sir
he
evidently
believed
me
to
be
some
sort
of
upper
servant
and
this
added
to
my
joy
of
the
day
with
my
good
humor
augmented
by
the
interview
i
entered
the
house
a
strange
footman
admitted
me
and
i
went
to
my
room
at
once
without
meeting
any
one
else
the
man
followed
me
with
a
penciled
note
signed
with
initials
requesting
my
presence
below
as
soon
as
possible
as
she
wished
to
see
me
before
dinner
the
thought
that
she
wished
to
see
me
at
any
time
filled
me
with
elation
and
her
few
lines
scratched
on
a
correspondence
card
were
a
pleasing
addendum
to
our
conversation
of
the
morning
i
only
wondered
whether
i
should
find
her
the
sober
reserved
young
woman
of
our
earlier
acquaintance
or
whether
she
would
choose
to
renew
the
good
comradeship
of
our
talk
on
the
train
the
finding
of
my
assistant
telegraphed
resignation
on
my
to
take
effect
in
january
had
not
the
slightest
effect
upon
the
lofty
minarets
in
which
my
fancy
now
found
lodgment
it
pleased
me
to
believe
that
fighting
blood
still
pulsed
in
the
last
of
the
house
of
ames
and
that
i
had
hurled
defiance
at
the
organized
band
of
suitors
that
guarded
the
hopefield
gates
and
picketed
the
surrounding
hills
my
question
as
to
which
cecilia
i
should
find
in
the
library
was
quickly
answered
her
frank
smile
the
candor
of
her
eyes
confessed
a
new
tie
between
us
we
were
becoming
conspirators
within
the
main
conspiracy
whatever
its
character
might
be
as
to
providence
and
the
cook
what
luck
i
asked
oh
i
managed
that
very
easily
i
ran
into
some
friends
who
were
going
abroad
for
the
winter
they
have
a
staff
of
unusual
servants
and
were
anxious
to
keep
them
together
until
their
return
i
promptly
engaged
them
all
and
they
are
even
now
installed
i
came
up
on
the
train
with
them
and
as
they
are
unusually
intelligent
and
biddable
they
agreed
to
stray
in
in
a
casual
and
desultory
way
through
the
afternoon
aunt
octavia
really
believed
or
pretended
she
did
which
is
just
as
good
that
providence
had
sent
them
and
was
delighted
the
laundress
the
last
to
appear
has
just
arrived
and
aunt
octavia
is
in
fine
humor
she
did
even
ask
me
how
i
came
off
in
my
encounter
at
the
dentist
she
had
filled
the
and
had
a
good
time
while
i
was
gone
well
i
have
had
an
adventure
of
my
own
i
remarked
after
expressing
my
relief
that
she
had
solved
the
servant
difficulty
with
so
much
ease
a
committee
of
gentlemen
waited
on
me
in
my
office
on
a
matter
of
grave
importance
she
lifted
her
brows
and
folded
her
hands
upon
her
knees
it
was
a
pretty
way
she
had
was
it
the
freedom
of
the
city
or
some
high
recognition
of
your
professional
ability
mr
ames
oh
far
more
exciting
three
gentlemen
representing
the
trust
now
maintaining
headquarters
at
the
prescott
arms
warned
me
solemnly
to
keep
off
the
grass
in
other
words
i
am
not
to
interfere
with
their
designs
upon
the
heart
of
miss
cecilia
hollister
she
flung
open
a
fan
held
it
at
arm
length
and
scrutinized
the
daffodils
that
were
traced
upon
it
so
they
dared
you
so
they
dared
me
and
i
took
the
dare
why
her
eyes
met
mine
gravely
but
behind
her
pretty
a
smile
lurked
delightfully
illustration
her
eyes
met
mine
gravely
if
i
should
tell
you
now
it
would
be
flirting
which
is
a
sin
i
had
imagined
ames
that
that
sort
of
thing
came
easy
to
you
but
if
it
sinful
of
course
but
you
do
not
rule
me
out
you
will
give
me
a
chance
my
earnestness
caused
her
manner
to
change
suddenly
her
beautiful
gravity
came
like
a
swift
falling
of
starlit
twilight
i
had
never
been
so
happy
as
at
this
moment
preposterous
as
were
the
circumstances
of
my
presence
in
the
house
the
juxtaposition
of
cecilia
hollister
gave
me
unalloyed
delight
the
animosity
of
the
gentlemen
at
the
prescott
arms
an
animosity
which
the
interview
in
my
office
had
doubtless
intensified
quickened
my
satisfaction
in
thus
being
within
the
walls
that
guarded
the
lady
of
their
adoration
she
had
not
answered
me
and
i
felt
my
heart
pounding
in
the
silence
i
want
to
serve
you
now
hereafter
and
always
i
added
these
men
can
have
no
claim
upon
you
greater
than
that
of
any
other
man
who
dares
no
none
whatever
she
replied
firmly
and
the
mystery
the
whole
story
is
in
the
little
silver
book
she
started
flushed
and
then
laughter
visited
her
lips
and
eyes
the
book
was
not
in
her
hands
nor
in
sight
anywhere
but
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
and
that
the
little
trinket
had
to
do
with
her
plight
and
her
compact
with
her
aunt
best
of
all
the
fact
that
i
had
chanced
upon
this
clue
gave
her
happiness
there
was
no
debating
that
you
had
best
have
a
care
ames
you
have
spoken
words
that
would
be
treasonable
if
they
came
from
me
and
i
must
not
countenance
them
but
you
will
tolerate
from
me
words
that
you
would
not
permit
another
to
speak
do
i
go
too
far
she
bent
her
head
to
one
side
with
the
slightest
inclination
as
of
a
rose
touched
by
a
vagrant
wind
if
i
could
only
half
believe
in
you
she
said
you
might
really
serve
me
so
those
gentlemen
warned
you
away
their
presumption
is
certainly
astounding
they
know
nothing
of
the
silver
book
they
know
less
than
you
do
and
you
have
a
good
deal
to
learn
you
know
i
am
dull
enough
but
i
have
no
ambition
but
to
read
the
riddle
of
the
sibyl
leaves
that
and
the
laying
of
the
ghost
are
my
immediate
business
as
for
the
gentlemen
at
the
prescott
including
my
old
friend
hartley
wiggins
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
them
my
hand
is
raised
against
them
if
it
a
case
of
the
test
of
ulysses
over
again
i
as
likely
as
any
of
them
to
bend
the
bow
i
thought
this
well
spoken
but
she
seemed
amused
though
without
unkindness
by
the
earnestness
of
my
speech
if
your
wit
is
equal
to
your
valor
you
may
go
far
but
and
she
turned
her
eyes
full
upon
me
we
must
play
the
game
according
to
the
rules
and
as
for
hartley
wiggins
she
sat
up
very
straight
and
the
sudden
disdain
in
her
face
startled
me
i
had
forgotten
my
eavesdropping
in
the
clump
of
raspberries
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
certainly
wiggins
had
been
decidedly
in
the
race
then
and
my
heart
thumped
in
resentment
as
i
recalled
her
own
message
all
compact
of
encouragement
which
i
had
borne
to
wiggins
at
the
prescott
arms
i
will
tell
you
something
ames
this
afternoon
as
i
drove
from
the
station
i
came
round
by
the
lake
merely
to
cool
my
eyes
on
the
water
and
i
saw
wiggins
and
my
sister
seated
on
a
wall
in
an
old
orchard
they
were
so
busily
engaged
that
they
did
not
see
me
at
least
he
did
not
but
i
think
hezekiah
did
hezekiah
i
answered
relieved
by
the
nature
of
her
disclosure
which
could
not
but
prejudice
wiggins
case
hezekiah
is
fond
of
orchards
i
dare
say
this
was
the
same
one
in
which
i
had
a
charming
talk
with
her
myself
doubtless
she
was
amusing
herself
with
wiggins
just
as
she
did
with
me
she
finds
the
genus
homo
entertaining
she
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
the
sweetest
the
loveliest
the
brightest
wiggins
has
treated
her
outrageously
he
has
taken
advantage
of
her
youth
and
susceptible
nature
his
punishment
is
sure
i
answered
complacently
hezekiah
laughed
when
i
mentioned
his
name
and
you
frown
at
the
thought
of
him
aunt
octavia
is
coming
she
remarked
feigning
at
once
a
careless
air
but
i
was
content
that
she
let
my
remark
pass
unchallenged
miss
octavia
entrances
were
always
effective
she
appeared
charmingly
gowned
but
the
bright
twinkle
in
her
eyes
made
it
clear
that
no
matter
of
dress
could
affect
her
humor
or
spirit
she
greeted
me
as
she
always
did
as
though
our
acquaintance
were
a
matter
of
years
rather
than
of
days
i
even
imagined
that
she
seemed
pleased
to
find
me
back
again
she
asked
no
questions
as
to
my
day
occupations
but
as
we
went
in
to
dinner
sallied
forth
cheerfully
upon
a
description
of
her
own
activities
after
i
had
baked
my
required
quota
of
pies
this
morning
i
sought
recreation
at
the
traps
the
who
has
been
pulling
the
string
for
me
having
it
most
providentially
happened
that
i
espied
lord
arrowood
hanging
on
the
edge
of
the
maple
tangle
beyond
the
barn
i
summoned
him
at
once
and
put
him
to
work
managing
the
traps
for
me
finding
him
most
efficient
he
seemed
extremely
despondent
and
after
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
two
out
of
three
was
not
an
impossible
record
for
one
of
my
years
i
brought
him
to
the
house
and
made
tea
for
him
i
left
the
room
for
a
moment
i
had
taken
him
into
the
kitchen
where
during
the
incumbency
of
the
regular
cook
i
hardly
dare
venture
myself
and
he
made
himself
comfortable
quite
near
the
range
the
pies
on
which
i
had
been
engaged
all
morning
lay
cooling
near
him
i
had
composed
pies
i
am
an
excellent
mathematician
and
i
could
not
have
been
mistaken
in
the
count
what
was
my
amazement
to
find
after
his
lordship
departure
that
one
pie
was
missing
the
pan
in
which
it
was
baked
i
discerned
later
jammed
into
a
barrel
of
excellent
minnesota
flour
my
absence
from
the
room
was
the
briefest
his
lordship
must
indeed
be
a
prestidigitateur
to
have
made
way
with
the
pie
so
expeditiously
his
lordship
was
doubtless
hungry
i
suggested
even
nobility
must
eat
i
passed
lord
arrowood
in
the
highway
early
this
morning
sitting
upon
a
stone
with
sundry
items
of
reposing
beside
him
i
have
rarely
seen
any
one
so
depressed
he
belongs
to
an
ancient
house
remarked
miss
octavia
he
is
descended
from
either
hengist
or
horsa
i
forget
which
but
it
does
not
greatly
matter
the
missing
pie
i
may
add
was
an
effect
in
westchester
pippin
and
as
our
american
experiment
in
bores
him
i
take
it
as
significant
that
he
chanced
upon
food
that
is
the
veritable
sacrament
of
democracy
now
that
the
little
matter
of
the
servants
has
been
adjusted
we
must
have
a
care
lest
the
phalanx
which
providence
so
kindly
sent
to
you
is
not
stampeded
by
any
further
manifestations
of
the
troubled
spirit
of
the
unfortunate
briton
who
was
hanged
on
the
site
of
this
house
ames
replied
miss
octavia
impressively
that
matter
is
entirely
in
your
hands
but
if
i
could
see
the
plans
of
this
house
i
should
be
better
able
to
grapple
with
his
ghostship
i
had
thrown
this
out
in
the
hope
of
eliciting
some
remark
from
her
touching
the
swedish
maid
visit
to
pepperton
office
but
miss
octavia
met
my
gaze
unflinchingly
you
are
a
clever
man
ames
and
i
have
every
confidence
that
you
will
not
only
solve
the
mystery
of
the
library
chimney
but
find
the
ghost
that
switched
off
the
lights
on
the
stair
last
night
i
prefer
that
you
should
accomplish
these
feats
without
any
help
from
the
plans
i
myself
have
no
suggestions
i
am
gratified
that
you
are
meeting
the
emergencies
that
have
risen
here
with
so
much
determination
but
it
is
what
i
should
expect
of
the
son
of
arnold
ames
of
hartford
opportunity
is
all
that
any
of
us
need
to
find
ourselves
truly
great
and
if
in
the
ordinary
course
of
our
lives
the
gate
does
not
open
freely
we
are
justified
in
picking
the
lock
when
i
determined
to
seek
adventures
in
my
old
age
i
resolved
that
i
should
miss
no
chance
and
that
i
should
be
prepared
for
any
beckoning
of
the
hand
of
fate
an
odd
fancy
struck
me
at
the
beginning
of
my
new
life
that
boston
would
some
day
be
the
of
some
interesting
experience
this
has
not
yet
developed
but
in
order
that
i
may
be
prepared
for
anything
that
may
occur
i
keep
a
umbrella
constantly
checked
at
the
parker
house
the
presence
of
the
little
brass
check
in
my
purse
is
a
constant
reminder
that
boston
may
one
day
call
me
a
discussion
of
the
parker
house
umbrella
followed
cecilia
and
i
joining
and
it
proved
so
fruitful
a
topic
that
it
carried
us
to
our
coffee
in
a
machine
she
had
herself
contrived
was
always
attended
with
rites
that
required
deliberation
and
while
she
performed
them
miss
hollister
continued
to
amuse
us
you
may
not
know
she
remarked
in
one
of
her
charming
irrelevant
outbursts
that
the
most
important
furniture
transactions
effected
in
this
country
are
those
negotiated
daily
by
the
of
the
fifth
avenue
restaurants
such
is
i
assure
you
the
fact
these
gentlemen
who
have
attained
front
rank
among
our
predatory
rich
allow
no
one
to
dine
at
the
inns
they
dominate
who
does
not
first
purchase
a
table
and
chairs
at
a
profit
of
at
least
two
hundred
per
cent
over
the
original
grand
rapids
cost
the
furniture
thus
purchased
reverting
in
every
case
to
the
party
of
the
first
part
after
the
purchasers
have
eaten
to
their
satisfaction
the
fifth
avenue
are
not
only
the
most
absolute
autocrats
of
our
time
but
the
most
acute
students
of
human
nature
among
us
the
sale
of
the
tables
by
the
lords
of
the
is
alone
worth
a
fortune
every
season
at
our
fashionable
victualing
houses
and
in
addition
the
humbler
members
of
the
minor
orders
of
waiters
who
merely
fetch
and
carry
are
obliged
to
share
their
gratuities
with
their
august
chiefs
the
system
is
iniquitous
i
declared
it
enough
to
pay
two
prices
for
the
food
without
buying
the
hotel
furniture
the
system
ames
is
wholly
admirable
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
expressing
a
difference
of
opinion
we
can
not
do
less
than
admire
the
austere
genius
before
which
mere
plutocrats
and
men
of
affairs
meekly
bow
in
making
my
own
investments
i
would
rather
have
the
advice
of
alphonse
at
the
hotel
pallida
than
that
of
the
president
of
the
strongest
trust
company
on
manhattan
island
the
varying
size
of
the
sums
he
receives
for
the
furniture
is
the
best
possible
indication
of
the
condition
of
the
market
when
a
citizen
of
pittsburg
will
pay
no
more
than
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
use
of
a
table
to
eat
from
at
the
pallida
you
may
be
sure
that
a
panic
impends
by
the
way
i
proposed
to
alphonse
last
winter
the
organization
of
a
limited
company
of
leading
to
control
the
waiting
industry
of
fifth
avenue
it
was
my
idea
that
some
special
forms
of
torture
might
be
devised
for
calculating
persons
usually
readers
of
new
york
letters
in
provincial
newspapers
who
think
a
waiter
entitled
to
only
ten
per
cent
of
the
bill
and
this
could
best
be
managed
by
an
arrangement
between
the
five
or
six
magnates
who
control
the
more
gilded
and
imposing
refectories
i
suggested
the
placing
of
a
special
mark
in
the
hats
of
the
fiends
so
that
wherever
they
dine
the
symbol
of
their
indiscreet
frugalities
would
be
apparent
to
the
initiated
eye
it
is
another
of
my
notions
that
the
and
his
humble
slave
should
present
a
formal
bill
for
their
services
while
the
hotel
or
restaurant
should
merely
be
tipped
in
this
way
the
more
important
service
would
receive
its
due
consideration
the
sole
office
of
the
proprietor
is
to
provide
the
a
place
in
which
to
follow
his
profession
alphonse
is
impressed
with
my
ideas
and
has
even
offered
to
make
me
a
director
of
the
company
i
suppose
that
you
won
the
regard
of
alphonse
the
magnificent
only
by
the
most
princely
tips
through
many
years
of
acquaintance
miss
hollister
on
the
other
hand
ames
i
never
gave
him
a
cent
in
my
life
but
last
christmas
in
recognition
of
his
friendliness
in
warning
me
against
an
salad
at
a
moment
when
that
vegetable
was
at
the
turn
of
the
season
i
knit
him
a
pair
of
blue
worsted
slippers
which
he
received
with
the
liveliest
expressions
of
delight
three
suitors
were
announced
at
this
moment
and
i
slipped
away
without
excuses
while
miss
octavia
and
cecilia
adjourned
to
the
library
the
ghost
i
had
sworn
should
not
baffle
me
another
night
xiii
i
discover
two
ghosts
as
i
crossed
the
hall
i
passed
the
swedish
maid
walking
toward
miss
octavia
room
i
was
somewhat
annoyed
to
find
on
looking
over
my
shoulder
to
make
sure
of
her
destination
that
she
too
had
paused
her
hand
on
miss
octavia
door
and
was
watching
me
with
interest
she
vanished
immediately
but
to
throw
her
off
the
track
i
went
to
my
own
room
closed
the
door
noisily
and
then
came
out
quickly
and
ran
up
to
the
third
floor
bassford
hollister
mysterious
exit
had
lingered
in
my
mind
as
the
most
curious
incident
of
the
eventful
friday
night
having
been
baffled
in
my
effort
to
get
hold
of
the
architect
plans
my
thought
now
was
to
await
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
a
repetition
of
the
various
phenomena
that
had
so
puzzled
me
by
the
process
of
exclusion
i
had
eliminated
nearly
every
plausible
theory
but
if
the
ghost
manifested
himself
with
any
sort
of
periodicity
and
the
hour
of
the
chimney
queer
behavior
had
been
nine
i
was
now
prepared
to
meet
him
in
the
regions
he
had
chosen
for
his
exploits
when
it
is
remembered
that
i
had
always
been
most
timorous
not
at
all
anxious
to
shine
in
any
heroic
performances
it
will
be
understood
that
the
atmosphere
of
hopefield
manor
was
exerting
a
stimulating
effect
upon
my
courage
or
more
likely
my
inherent
cowardice
had
been
brought
into
subjection
by
my
curiosity
i
had
a
pretty
accurate
knowledge
by
this
time
of
the
position
and
function
of
all
the
electric
switches
between
the
lower
hall
and
the
fourth
floor
but
i
tested
them
as
i
ascended
glancing
down
now
and
then
to
make
sure
i
was
not
observed
from
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
library
i
judged
that
most
of
cecilia
suitors
must
now
have
arrived
and
so
much
the
better
i
argued
for
with
miss
octavia
and
her
niece
fully
occupied
i
could
the
better
carry
on
my
above
stairs
at
a
quarter
before
nine
i
switched
off
the
lights
on
the
third
and
fourth
floors
and
established
myself
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
and
quite
near
the
door
this
door
i
had
opened
as
i
fancied
that
if
bassford
hollister
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
he
would
probably
wish
to
find
his
way
to
the
roof
again
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
manage
it
the
stage
was
in
readiness
for
the
entrance
of
the
goblin
and
i
may
record
my
impression
that
as
we
wait
for
a
visitation
of
this
sort
it
is
with
a
degree
of
credence
in
things
supernatural
to
which
we
would
not
ordinarily
confess
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
expect
something
to
appear
something
unearthly
impalpable
and
unresponsive
to
those
tests
we
apply
to
the
known
and
understood
the
clock
below
struck
nine
upon
these
meditations
and
almost
upon
the
last
stroke
i
heard
a
sound
that
set
my
nerves
tingling
i
crouched
in
the
dark
waiting
some
one
was
coming
toward
me
but
from
where
the
bottom
of
a
well
at
midnight
was
not
blacker
than
the
fourth
floor
but
the
switch
lay
ready
to
my
hand
and
my
pockets
were
stuffed
with
matches
of
the
sort
that
light
anywhere
the
stairways
were
all
carpeted
as
i
have
said
and
yet
some
one
was
ascending
bare
treads
lightly
and
with
delays
that
suggested
a
furtive
purpose
meanwhile
as
a
background
for
this
unreality
murmurs
of
talk
and
occasional
laughter
rose
from
the
library
this
concealed
stairway
wherever
it
was
could
not
be
of
interminable
length
and
i
had
counted
i
think
fifteen
steps
of
that
strange
ascent
when
it
ceased
i
heard
a
fumbling
as
of
some
one
seeking
a
latch
and
suddenly
a
light
current
of
air
swept
by
me
but
its
clean
fresh
quality
was
not
in
itself
disturbing
i
stooped
and
struck
a
match
smartly
on
the
carpet
and
at
the
same
time
clicked
the
switch
i
should
say
that
not
more
than
ten
seconds
passed
from
the
moment
the
soft
rush
of
air
had
first
advertised
the
opening
of
a
passage
near
me
until
the
hall
was
flooded
with
the
glow
of
the
electric
lamps
overhead
my
match
had
also
performed
its
office
but
finding
the
electric
current
behaving
itself
normally
i
blew
it
out
what
i
saw
now
interested
me
immensely
in
the
solid
wall
near
the
stair
and
almost
directly
opposite
the
a
narrow
door
had
swung
outward
a
neat
contrivance
so
light
in
its
construction
that
it
still
swayed
on
its
concealed
hinges
from
the
touch
of
the
hand
that
had
released
it
how
it
had
opened
or
what
had
become
of
the
prowler
who
had
unlatched
it
remained
to
be
discovered
it
seemed
impossible
that
whoever
or
whatever
had
climbed
the
hidden
stairway
had
descended
nor
had
i
been
conscious
of
a
ghostly
passing
as
on
the
previous
night
i
had
only
my
senses
to
apply
to
this
problem
and
their
efficiency
was
minimized
for
a
moment
by
fear
the
opening
in
the
wall
engaged
my
attention
at
once
and
i
was
steadied
by
the
thought
that
here
was
a
practical
matter
susceptible
of
investigation
i
stepped
within
the
door
and
lighted
a
candle
and
just
as
the
wick
caught
fire
click
went
a
switch
somewhere
and
out
went
the
hall
lamps
but
having
so
to
speak
put
my
foot
to
the
mysterious
stair
i
would
not
turn
back
and
i
continued
on
down
the
steps
great
was
my
astonishment
to
find
that
i
had
apparently
stepped
from
a
new
into
an
old
house
the
stair
treads
were
worn
by
long
use
the
plaster
walls
that
inclosed
them
were
battered
and
cracked
and
i
seemed
to
have
plunged
from
the
glory
of
hopefield
into
some
dim
lost
passage
of
a
domicile
of
another
era
that
lay
within
or
beneath
the
walls
of
the
manor
as
i
slowly
descended
holding
high
my
candle
i
recalled
not
without
a
qualm
the
story
of
the
british
soldier
whom
tradition
or
superstition
linked
to
the
site
of
miss
property
this
stairway
might
certainly
have
been
built
in
the
early
days
of
the
republic
and
it
refuted
my
disdain
of
the
on
the
theory
that
new
houses
are
inhospitable
to
spirits
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
i
found
two
rooms
one
on
either
side
of
a
small
hall
and
these
also
were
clearly
part
of
an
old
house
that
seemed
to
be
somehow
merged
into
the
hollister
mansion
i
remembered
now
that
the
mansion
stood
wedged
against
a
rough
spur
of
rock
and
that
the
front
and
rear
entrances
were
upon
different
levels
and
it
was
conceivable
that
the
back
part
of
the
mansion
might
inclose
these
rooms
of
an
earlier
house
that
had
occupied
the
same
site
why
they
should
have
been
retained
was
beyond
me
through
the
windows
and
quaint
of
these
hidden
rooms
the
infolding
walls
of
the
new
house
were
blank
and
black
an
odd
thing
indeed
that
pepperton
should
have
lent
himself
to
the
preservation
of
a
commonplace
and
thoroughly
uninteresting
relic
for
beyond
doubt
he
must
have
countenanced
it
and
miss
prompt
removal
of
the
plans
from
the
architect
office
became
more
enigmatical
than
ever
one
door
only
remained
in
this
shell
of
the
old
house
and
i
hastened
to
fling
it
open
still
lighting
my
way
with
a
candle
before
me
lay
the
coal
cellar
at
which
i
had
merely
glanced
on
the
morning
after
my
installation
at
hopefield
i
now
began
to
get
my
bearings
i
remembered
two
iron
lids
in
the
cemented
surface
of
an
area
on
the
east
side
of
the
house
where
fuel
was
deposited
and
mounting
a
few
steps
that
were
of
recent
construction
and
had
evidently
been
built
to
afford
communication
between
the
remnant
of
the
old
house
and
the
subterranean
portion
of
the
new
i
found
to
my
relief
and
satisfaction
beneath
one
of
these
openings
a
short
ladder
through
which
the
court
might
be
reached
here
then
the
manner
of
ghostly
ingress
was
illustrated
by
perfectly
plausible
means
the
lid
of
the
was
entirely
withdrawn
and
a
bar
of
moonlight
lay
brightening
upon
a
pile
of
anthracite
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
the
ghost
i
believed
to
be
still
in
the
upper
halls
of
the
house
and
now
that
i
was
in
a
position
to
watch
the
ladder
by
which
he
had
entered
i
felt
confident
that
i
had
cut
off
his
retreat
i
was
surveying
the
cellar
when
i
heard
faint
sounds
in
a
new
direction
far
away
under
the
house
and
remote
from
the
secret
steps
some
one
was
moving
toward
me
and
rapidly
too
the
ghost
that
i
believed
to
have
disappeared
into
the
hall
must
then
have
changed
the
line
of
his
retreat
and
descended
by
one
of
the
regular
stairways
i
blew
out
my
candle
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
wall
of
the
long
corridor
on
which
opened
the
various
the
heating
plant
laundry
and
other
accessories
of
the
modern
house
my
ghost
was
coming
in
haste
a
haste
that
did
not
harmonize
with
the
stately
tread
of
the
spooks
of
popular
superstition
a
slower
pace
and
i
should
doubtless
have
fled
before
him
but
quick
light
steps
echoed
in
the
dark
corridor
and
i
gathered
courage
from
the
thought
that
ghosts
create
echoes
no
more
than
they
cast
shadows
as
the
steps
drew
nearer
i
prepared
myself
to
spring
upon
him
i
must
unconsciously
have
taken
a
step
for
he
paused
suddenly
stood
still
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
scampered
back
the
way
he
had
come
after
him
i
went
as
fast
as
i
could
run
the
corridor
was
four
or
five
feet
wide
and
i
plunged
through
the
dark
at
my
best
speed
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
i
was
pretty
certain
of
my
quarry
and
i
made
ready
to
grapple
with
him
then
as
i
plunged
into
the
wall
my
hands
touched
a
man
face
and
for
a
moment
clutched
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
had
been
waiting
for
me
to
strike
the
wall
and
as
he
slipped
out
of
my
grasp
he
ran
back
toward
the
coal
cellar
i
had
struck
the
wall
with
a
force
that
knocked
the
wind
out
of
me
but
i
got
myself
together
with
the
loss
of
only
an
instant
and
renewed
pursuit
i
had
no
fear
but
that
if
he
attempted
to
reach
the
open
by
means
of
the
i
should
catch
him
on
the
ladder
and
i
sprinted
for
all
i
was
worth
to
make
sure
of
him
my
fleeting
grasp
of
the
man
collar
and
the
agility
with
which
he
had
slipped
from
my
clasp
had
settled
the
ghost
question
and
i
had
now
resolved
the
intruder
into
a
common
thief
as
we
neared
the
coal
cellar
i
increased
my
pace
and
felt
myself
gaining
on
him
though
in
the
dark
i
saw
nothing
until
i
glimpsed
the
faint
light
from
the
it
had
evidently
occurred
to
him
by
this
time
that
if
he
tried
to
climb
the
ladder
i
could
easily
pull
him
down
by
the
legs
and
when
he
reached
the
cross
hall
he
turned
quickly
and
dived
through
the
opening
into
the
hidden
chambers
i
lost
no
time
in
following
but
the
fellow
put
up
a
good
race
and
as
i
reached
the
old
stairway
he
was
mounting
it
two
steps
at
a
time
as
i
judged
from
the
sound
i
had
hoped
to
catch
and
dispose
of
him
without
alarming
the
house
but
it
seemed
inevitable
now
that
the
chase
would
end
in
such
fashion
as
to
arouse
the
company
assembled
in
the
library
i
heard
him
stumble
and
fall
headlong
at
the
door
above
then
he
shot
off
into
the
still
darkened
hall
and
when
i
had
gained
the
top
i
lost
track
of
him
for
a
moment
i
paused
and
was
about
to
strike
a
match
when
he
resumed
his
flight
and
i
was
forced
to
grapple
with
the
fact
that
some
one
else
was
pursuing
him
i
held
my
match
unstruck
upon
this
new
disclosure
and
stepped
back
within
the
concealed
door
and
waited
up
and
down
the
hall
two
persons
were
running
and
when
they
reached
the
ends
of
the
corridor
i
heard
hands
touch
the
wall
and
the
sound
of
dodging
and
then
almost
instantly
the
two
runners
flashed
by
me
again
the
hall
was
so
dark
that
i
saw
nothing
but
as
the
runners
passed
the
door
i
felt
the
rush
of
air
caused
by
their
flight
three
or
four
times
this
had
happened
and
then
still
without
having
made
a
light
i
thrust
out
my
foot
at
the
next
return
of
the
unseen
runners
some
one
tripped
and
fell
headlong
and
i
promptly
flung
myself
upon
him
my
prisoner
resistance
engaged
my
best
attention
a
moment
but
when
i
had
sat
upon
his
legs
and
got
hold
of
his
struggling
hands
some
one
stole
softly
by
me
my
prisoner
too
heard
and
was
attentive
not
only
did
i
experience
the
same
sensation
as
on
the
previous
night
of
a
passing
near
by
but
i
was
conscious
of
the
same
faint
perfume
as
of
a
in
a
garden
at
night
that
had
added
to
my
mystification
before
then
without
the
slightest
warning
the
lights
flashed
on
and
a
door
closed
somewhere
but
it
was
not
the
hidden
one
leading
down
into
the
remnant
of
the
old
house
for
my
prisoner
head
and
shoulders
lay
across
its
threshold
he
sighed
deeply
bringing
my
dazed
wits
back
to
him
and
i
found
myself
gazing
into
the
blinking
eyes
of
lord
arrowood
bounders
i
say
bounders
he
gasped
in
the
circumstances
lord
arrowood
i
should
not
call
names
will
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
running
through
this
house
in
this
fashion
stand
up
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
i
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
bent
over
the
leading
down
to
the
third
floor
evidently
our
strange
transactions
beneath
and
above
had
not
disturbed
the
assembled
suitors
and
their
hostesses
but
in
common
decency
lord
arrowood
must
be
disposed
of
promptly
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
i
was
an
ass
to
try
it
muttered
his
lordship
pulling
his
tie
into
shape
and
now
i
want
to
get
out
i
want
to
go
away
from
here
he
was
tugging
at
the
belt
of
his
norfolk
coat
and
something
between
it
and
his
waistcoat
evidently
gave
him
concern
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
he
was
really
a
thief
with
chattels
concealed
on
his
person
but
he
continued
to
smooth
his
jacket
anxiously
meanwhile
eyeing
me
apprehensively
he
puffed
hard
from
his
recent
game
of
and
his
face
was
wet
with
perspiration
our
conversation
was
carried
on
in
he
was
so
crestfallen
that
if
it
had
been
for
the
necessity
of
maintaining
silence
i
should
have
laughed
outright
out
with
it
my
lord
what
have
you
stuck
in
your
coat
they
bounders
all
the
rest
of
he
asserted
doggedly
but
i
believe
you
to
be
a
gentleman
i
thank
you
lord
arrowood
for
this
mark
of
confidence
but
you
have
led
me
a
hot
chase
through
this
house
and
it
is
clear
that
you
have
something
tucked
under
your
coat
that
you
have
seized
feloniously
we
standing
here
in
the
light
and
our
voices
may
at
any
moment
attract
miss
hollister
and
the
others
in
the
library
open
your
coat
i
declare
that
even
if
you
have
lifted
a
bit
of
the
hollister
plate
i
will
let
you
go
my
lord
if
you
please
stand
and
unfold
yourself
reluctantly
shamefacedly
and
still
breathing
hard
from
his
late
exertions
lord
arrowood
of
arrowood
hants
england
obeyed
me
there
were
five
buttons
to
the
jacket
and
the
loosening
of
every
succeeding
one
seemed
to
give
him
pain
then
with
his
head
slightly
lifted
as
though
in
disdain
of
me
he
held
out
for
my
observation
a
pie
in
the
pan
in
which
it
had
been
baked
the
top
crust
was
browned
to
a
nicety
its
edges
were
crimped
neatly
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
had
so
lately
dined
sumptuously
at
miss
hollister
hospitable
board
at
sight
of
this
alluring
pastry
i
experienced
the
sharp
twinges
of
aroused
appetite
illustration
he
held
out
for
my
observation
a
pie
now
you
have
it
and
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
said
lord
arrowood
kindly
allow
me
to
retire
by
the
way
i
came
first
i
replied
sobered
by
the
gravity
of
his
manner
it
would
interest
me
as
a
student
of
character
to
know
just
what
species
of
pie
lured
you
to
this
burglarious
deed
i
have
reason
to
think
he
answered
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
it
is
a
gooseberry
i
was
damned
hungry
if
you
must
know
the
truth
and
having
sampled
the
old
lady
pies
this
morning
and
had
nothing
to
eat
since
i
saw
the
open
and
ladder
beneath
and
the
rest
of
it
was
easy
if
you
and
the
other
chap
had
chased
me
all
over
the
estate
i
have
been
off
with
my
pie
and
no
harm
done
the
old
lady
insane
you
know
and
has
no
manner
of
use
for
pies
the
house
is
haunted
in
the
bargain
when
you
had
about
winded
me
down
in
the
cellar
and
cut
me
off
from
the
ladder
and
chased
me
up
here
the
ghost
took
a
hand
and
if
you
had
tripped
me
and
sat
on
me
the
spirits
would
certainly
have
nailed
me
o
lord
what
a
night
it
your
impression
then
that
when
you
got
up
here
somebody
else
broke
into
the
game
quite
that
only
i
should
say
not
it
was
a
lighter
step
than
yours
it
had
its
hand
on
me
once
but
i
could
touch
it
damn
me
he
concluded
hoarsely
it
was
there
to
touch
you
are
sure
you
speak
the
truth
when
you
say
that
the
was
open
and
that
you
found
the
ladder
there
when
you
came
no
manner
of
doubt
of
it
as
i
have
already
said
i
believe
you
to
be
a
gentleman
and
between
gentlemen
certain
confidences
may
pass
that
would
be
possible
between
a
gentleman
and
those
down
there
he
jerked
his
head
scornfully
to
indicate
the
suitors
below
i
bowed
with
such
dignity
as
is
possible
in
addressing
a
nobleman
whom
you
have
just
caught
in
the
act
of
lifting
a
from
a
lady
pantry
a
pie
which
you
hold
perforce
in
your
hands
the
fact
is
that
i
was
without
the
price
of
food
and
to
repeat
i
was
beastly
hungry
poverty
and
hunger
my
lord
are
pardonable
sins
and
i
dare
say
that
miss
hollister
would
be
highly
pleased
to
know
that
a
gentleman
of
your
high
position
she
told
me
herself
that
you
were
descended
from
the
jutish
chiefs
had
paid
so
high
a
compliment
to
the
excellence
of
her
pastry
your
only
error
as
i
view
the
matter
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
have
laid
felonious
hands
upon
a
all
gooseberry
pastries
are
sacred
to
hezekiah
my
impressions
of
hezekiah
are
the
pleasantest
and
i
can
not
allow
you
to
intervene
between
her
and
the
pie
i
hold
in
my
hands
if
you
will
accompany
me
below
i
will
undertake
to
gain
access
to
the
pie
vault
return
this
pie
to
its
proper
place
and
hand
you
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
an
in
place
of
it
i
dare
say
it
never
will
be
missed
but
from
what
i
know
of
hezekiah
any
trifling
with
her
appetite
would
be
a
crime
indictable
at
common
law
his
lordship
seemed
reassured
and
we
were
about
to
descend
by
the
concealed
stair
when
he
arrested
me
ames
you
are
a
gentleman
and
possess
a
generous
heart
we
understand
each
other
perfectly
and
as
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
my
suit
is
hopeless
i
ask
the
loan
of
five
dollars
until
i
can
confer
with
my
friend
the
british
consul
at
new
york
i
shall
sail
at
once
for
england
i
was
moved
to
pity
by
his
humility
a
man
who
finding
himself
reduced
to
larceny
by
hunger
and
being
unable
to
win
the
woman
of
his
choice
meekly
yields
to
the
inevitable
is
not
a
fair
mark
for
contumely
he
stepped
down
before
me
into
the
dark
stairway
and
i
closed
the
door
after
me
and
followed
him
i
found
my
way
to
the
pie
pantry
without
difficulty
returned
the
to
its
proper
shelf
chose
an
and
gave
it
with
a
note
to
lord
arrowood
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
he
pressed
my
hand
feelingly
and
expressed
his
gratitude
in
terms
that
would
have
touched
a
harder
heart
than
mine
then
having
closed
the
and
hidden
the
ladder
under
a
pile
of
wood
i
resumed
my
pursuit
of
the
ghost
xiv
lady
slipper
i
lighted
my
way
with
a
candle
through
the
lost
chambers
of
the
old
house
up
the
hidden
stairway
and
out
into
the
hall
again
the
old
stair
i
found
on
closer
observation
reached
only
from
the
second
to
the
fourth
floor
and
below
this
had
been
pieced
with
lumber
carefully
preserved
from
the
earlier
house
there
was
nothing
so
strange
after
all
about
the
hidden
stairway
though
i
was
convinced
that
this
had
been
no
idea
of
pepperton
but
that
he
had
merely
obeyed
the
orders
of
his
eccentric
client
the
umbrella
and
millionaire
i
had
no
sooner
let
myself
through
the
secret
door
into
the
upper
hall
than
i
was
aware
of
a
disturbance
in
the
library
below
i
heard
exclamations
from
the
men
and
as
i
ran
down
toward
the
third
floor
miss
octavia
voice
rose
above
the
tumult
we
must
have
patience
gentlemen
chimneys
are
subject
to
moods
just
like
human
beings
and
we
are
fortunate
in
having
in
the
house
a
gentleman
who
is
an
expert
in
such
matters
i
do
not
doubt
that
ames
even
now
has
his
hand
upon
the
chimney
pulse
and
that
he
will
soon
solve
this
perplexing
problem
if
you
wait
for
that
man
to
mend
your
chimney
you
will
wait
until
doomsday
so
spake
john
stewart
dick
taking
his
vengeance
of
me
with
my
client
and
hostess
i
might
have
forgiven
him
but
i
could
not
forgive
hartley
wiggins
he
does
know
any
more
about
chimneys
than
the
man
in
the
moon
my
old
friend
was
saying
between
coughs
and
then
quite
unmistakably
i
smelt
smoke
and
bending
further
over
the
rail
and
peering
down
the
i
saw
smoke
pouring
from
the
library
into
the
hall
it
seemed
to
be
in
greater
volume
than
at
previous
manifestations
a
cloud
was
filling
the
lower
hall
and
rising
toward
me
i
ran
quickly
to
the
third
floor
to
the
chamber
whose
fireplace
was
served
by
the
library
chimney
the
lights
in
the
hall
winked
out
as
i
opened
the
door
i
heard
a
step
behind
me
somewhere
but
i
did
not
trouble
about
this
the
switch
inside
the
unused
responded
readily
to
my
touch
and
on
kneeling
by
the
hearth
i
found
it
cold
as
i
had
expected
there
was
absolutely
no
way
of
choking
the
library
flue
at
this
point
for
as
i
had
established
earlier
all
the
fireplaces
in
this
chimney
had
their
independent
flues
pepperton
would
never
have
built
them
otherwise
and
no
one
but
a
skilled
mason
could
have
tapped
the
library
flue
here
or
higher
up
and
the
work
could
not
have
been
done
without
much
noise
and
labor
the
hall
outside
was
still
dark
and
i
did
not
try
the
switch
the
pursuit
was
better
carried
on
in
darkness
and
i
had
by
this
time
become
accustomed
to
rapid
locomotion
through
unlighted
passages
i
leaned
over
the
and
heard
exclamations
of
surprise
at
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
smoke
which
had
evidently
abated
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
the
windows
and
doors
had
been
opened
and
the
company
had
returned
to
the
library
quite
extraordinary
really
quite
remarkable
they
were
saying
below
i
heard
cecilia
light
laughter
as
the
odd
ways
of
the
chimney
were
discussed
and
as
i
stood
thus
peering
down
and
listening
the
swedish
maid
blonde
head
appeared
below
me
bending
over
the
on
the
second
floor
she
too
was
taking
note
of
affairs
in
the
library
and
as
i
watched
her
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
eyes
met
mine
then
while
we
still
stared
at
each
other
the
lights
went
out
with
familiar
abruptness
and
as
i
craned
my
neck
to
peer
into
the
blackness
above
me
i
experienced
once
more
that
ghostly
passing
as
of
some
light
unearthly
thing
across
my
face
i
reached
for
it
wildly
with
my
hands
but
it
seemed
to
be
caught
away
from
me
and
then
as
i
fought
the
air
madly
it
brushed
my
cheek
again
i
have
no
words
to
describe
the
strange
effect
of
that
touch
i
felt
my
scalp
creep
and
cold
chills
ran
down
my
spine
it
seemingly
came
from
above
and
it
was
not
like
a
hand
unless
a
hand
of
wonderful
lightness
certainly
no
human
arm
could
reach
down
the
to
where
i
stood
and
in
that
touch
there
was
something
akin
to
a
gentle
lingering
caress
as
it
swept
slowly
across
my
face
and
eyes
i
waited
for
its
recurrence
a
moment
but
it
came
no
more
then
on
a
sudden
prompting
i
stole
swiftly
to
the
fourth
floor
lighted
my
candle
and
gazed
about
i
thought
it
well
to
let
the
electric
light
alone
for
my
ghost
had
once
too
often
plunged
me
into
darkness
at
critical
moments
and
a
candle
in
my
hands
was
not
subject
to
his
trickery
the
hall
was
perfectly
quiet
the
door
leading
down
the
hidden
stair
was
invisible
and
i
had
not
yet
learned
how
it
might
be
opened
from
the
hall
though
bassford
hollister
had
undoubtedly
left
the
house
by
this
means
after
my
interview
with
him
on
the
roof
and
reminded
of
the
roof
i
opened
the
door
and
peered
in
the
slowly
crept
into
its
dark
corners
and
looking
up
i
marked
the
presence
of
the
secure
in
the
opening
as
i
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
my
hand
on
the
knob
and
the
candle
thrust
well
before
me
i
heard
a
slight
furtive
movement
to
my
left
and
behind
the
door
i
was
quite
satisfied
now
that
i
was
about
to
solve
some
of
the
mysteries
of
the
night
and
to
make
sure
i
was
unobserved
for
having
gone
so
far
alone
i
wanted
no
partners
in
my
investigations
i
listened
to
the
murmur
of
talk
below
for
a
moment
then
cautiously
advanced
my
candle
further
into
the
room
i
was
not
yet
so
valiant
even
after
all
my
and
explorations
of
hidden
chambers
but
that
i
thrust
the
light
in
well
ahead
of
me
and
bent
my
wrist
so
that
the
candle
rays
might
dispel
the
last
shadow
that
lurked
behind
the
door
before
i
suffered
my
eyes
to
look
upon
the
goblin
i
took
one
step
and
then
cautiously
another
until
the
whole
of
the
was
well
within
range
of
my
vision
and
there
seated
on
a
prodigious
trunk
frescoed
with
labels
of
a
dozen
foreign
inns
i
beheld
hezekiah
illustration
seated
on
a
prodigious
trunk
frescoed
with
labels
of
a
dozen
foreign
inns
i
beheld
hezekiah
as
i
recall
it
she
was
very
much
at
her
ease
she
sat
on
one
foot
and
the
other
beat
the
trunk
lightly
she
was
bareheaded
and
the
was
making
acquaintance
with
the
gold
in
her
hair
she
wore
her
white
sweater
as
on
that
day
in
the
orchard
and
with
much
gravity
as
our
eyes
met
she
thrust
a
hand
into
its
pocket
and
drew
out
a
cracker
i
was
not
half
so
surprised
at
finding
her
there
as
i
was
at
her
manner
now
that
she
was
caught
she
seemed
neither
distressed
astonished
nor
afraid
well
miss
hezekiah
i
said
i
half
suspected
you
all
along
wise
you
were
a
little
slow
about
it
though
i
was
indeed
you
gave
me
a
run
for
my
money
she
finished
her
cracker
at
the
third
bite
slapped
her
hands
together
to
free
them
of
possible
crumbs
and
was
about
to
speak
when
she
jumped
lightly
from
the
trunk
bent
her
head
toward
the
door
and
then
stepped
back
again
and
faced
me
imperturbably
and
now
that
you
found
me
the
joke
on
you
after
all
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
door
and
swung
it
nearly
shut
i
had
heard
what
she
had
heard
miss
octavia
was
coming
upstairs
she
had
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
swedish
maid
on
the
landing
and
hezekiah
quick
ear
had
heard
her
but
equanimity
was
disconcerting
even
with
her
aunt
close
at
hand
she
showed
not
the
slightest
alarm
she
resumed
her
seat
on
the
trunk
and
her
heel
thumped
it
tranquilly
the
joke
on
you
because
now
that
you
caught
me
playing
tricks
you
got
to
get
me
out
of
trouble
what
if
i
do
oh
nothing
she
answered
indifferently
looking
me
squarely
in
the
eye
but
your
aunt
would
make
no
end
of
a
row
and
you
would
cause
your
sister
to
lose
out
with
miss
octavia
as
i
understand
it
you
pledged
to
keep
off
the
reservation
it
was
part
of
the
family
agreement
but
i
here
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
ames
if
you
are
in
this
part
of
the
house
it
was
miss
octavia
voice
she
was
seeking
me
and
would
no
doubt
find
me
the
sequestration
of
hezekiah
became
now
an
urgent
and
delicate
matter
you
caught
me
said
hezekiah
calmly
and
now
you
got
to
get
me
out
and
i
wish
you
good
luck
and
besides
i
lost
one
of
my
shoes
somewhere
and
you
got
to
find
that
in
proof
of
her
statement
she
submitted
a
shoeless
foot
for
my
observation
the
one
i
lost
was
like
this
and
hezekiah
thrust
forth
a
neat
tan
pump
rather
the
worse
for
wear
i
was
on
the
second
floor
a
bit
ago
she
began
and
lost
my
slipper
in
what
mischief
pray
ames
called
miss
octavia
her
voice
close
at
hand
i
wanted
to
see
something
in
cecilia
room
so
i
opened
her
door
and
walked
in
that
all
hezekiah
replied
wicked
hezekiah
coming
into
the
house
is
bad
enough
in
all
the
circumstances
entering
your
sister
room
is
a
grievous
sin
if
ames
you
are
still
seeking
an
explanation
of
that
behavior
it
was
miss
octavia
now
just
outside
the
door
do
leave
that
trunk
hezekiah
i
whispered
i
do
the
best
i
can
miss
octavia
met
me
smilingly
as
i
faced
her
in
the
hall
she
had
switched
on
the
lights
and
my
candle
burned
yellowly
in
the
white
electric
glow
miss
octavia
held
something
in
her
hand
it
required
no
second
glance
to
tell
me
that
she
had
found
hezekiah
slipper
ames
she
began
as
you
have
absented
yourself
from
the
library
all
evening
i
assume
that
you
have
been
busy
studying
my
chimneys
and
seeking
for
the
ghost
of
that
british
soldier
who
was
so
wantonly
slain
upon
the
site
of
this
house
i
am
glad
to
say
that
not
only
is
your
surmise
correct
miss
hollister
but
that
i
have
made
great
progress
in
both
directions
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
really
found
traces
of
the
ghost
not
only
that
miss
hollister
but
i
have
met
the
ghost
face
to
face
even
more
i
have
had
speech
with
him
her
face
brightened
her
eyes
flashed
it
was
plain
that
she
was
immensely
pleased
and
are
you
able
to
say
from
your
encounter
that
he
is
in
fact
a
british
subject
uneasily
haunting
this
house
in
america
long
after
the
declaration
of
independence
and
washington
farewell
address
have
passed
into
literature
you
have
never
spoken
a
truer
word
miss
hollister
the
ghost
with
whom
or
which
i
have
had
speech
is
still
a
loyal
subject
of
the
king
of
england
but
by
means
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
disclose
i
have
persuaded
him
not
to
visit
this
house
again
then
said
miss
hollister
i
can
not
do
less
than
express
my
gratitude
though
i
regret
that
you
did
not
first
allow
me
to
meet
him
still
i
dare
say
that
we
shall
find
his
bones
buried
somewhere
beneath
my
foundations
please
assure
me
that
such
is
your
expectation
she
was
leading
me
into
deep
water
but
i
had
skirted
the
coasts
of
truth
so
far
and
with
hezekiah
on
my
hands
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
satisfy
miss
hollister
in
every
particular
miss
hollister
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
showing
you
certain
hidden
chambers
in
this
house
which
i
venture
to
say
will
afford
you
great
pleasure
i
have
discovered
a
link
between
the
mansion
as
you
know
it
and
an
earlier
house
whose
timbers
may
indeed
hide
the
bones
of
that
british
soldier
and
as
for
the
chimney
and
as
for
the
chimney
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
professional
man
that
it
will
never
annoy
you
again
and
i
therefore
beg
that
you
dismiss
the
subject
from
your
mind
i
saw
that
she
was
about
to
recur
to
the
shoe
she
held
in
her
hand
and
at
which
she
glanced
frequently
with
a
quizzical
expression
this
clearly
was
an
issue
that
must
be
met
promptly
and
i
knew
of
no
better
way
than
by
lying
hezekiah
herself
had
plainly
stated
on
the
morning
of
that
long
eventful
day
when
she
walked
into
the
in
her
aunt
absence
and
explained
cecilia
trip
to
town
that
it
was
perfectly
fair
to
dissimulate
in
making
explanations
to
miss
hollister
that
in
fact
miss
octavia
enjoyed
nothing
better
than
the
injection
of
fiction
into
the
affairs
of
the
day
here
then
was
my
opportunity
hezekiah
had
thrown
the
responsibility
of
contriving
her
safe
exit
upon
my
hands
no
doubt
while
i
held
the
door
against
her
aunt
that
remarkable
young
woman
was
coolly
sitting
on
the
trunk
within
eating
another
cracker
and
awaiting
my
experiments
in
the
gentle
art
of
lying
miss
hollister
i
began
boldly
the
slipper
you
hold
in
your
hand
belongs
to
me
and
if
you
have
no
immediate
use
for
it
i
beg
that
you
allow
me
to
relieve
you
of
it
it
is
yours
mr
ames
a
lifting
of
the
brows
a
widening
of
the
eyes
denoted
miss
polite
surprise
beyond
any
question
it
is
my
property
i
asserted
your
words
interest
me
greatly
ames
as
you
know
the
grim
hard
life
of
the
twentieth
century
palls
upon
me
and
i
am
deeply
interested
in
everything
that
pertains
to
adventure
and
romance
tell
me
more
if
you
are
free
to
do
so
of
this
slipper
which
i
now
return
to
you
i
received
hezekiah
worn
little
pump
into
my
hands
as
though
it
were
an
object
of
high
consecration
and
with
a
gravity
which
i
hope
matched
miss
octavia
own
i
was
i
think
by
this
time
completely
hollisterized
if
i
may
coin
the
word
as
i
am
nothing
if
not
frank
miss
hollister
i
will
confess
to
you
that
this
shoe
came
into
my
possession
in
a
very
curious
way
one
day
last
spring
i
was
in
boston
having
been
called
there
on
professional
business
in
the
evening
i
left
my
hotel
for
a
walk
crossed
the
common
took
a
turn
through
the
public
garden
where
many
devoted
lovers
adorned
the
benches
and
then
strolled
aimlessly
along
beacon
street
i
know
that
historic
thoroughfare
well
interrupted
miss
hollister
as
my
friend
miss
prudence
biddeford
has
lived
there
for
half
a
century
and
once
while
i
was
staying
in
her
house
she
gave
me
her
recipe
for
boston
brown
bread
thereby
placing
me
greatly
in
her
debt
then
being
acquainted
with
the
neighborhood
and
its
sublimated
social
atmosphere
you
will
be
interested
in
the
experience
i
am
about
to
describe
i
continued
reassured
by
miss
octavia
sympathetic
attention
to
my
recital
i
was
passing
a
house
which
i
have
not
since
been
able
to
identify
exactly
though
i
have
several
times
revisited
boston
in
the
hope
of
doing
so
when
suddenly
and
without
any
warning
whatever
this
slipper
dropped
at
my
feet
all
the
houses
in
the
neighborhood
seemed
deserted
with
windows
and
doors
tightly
boarded
and
my
closest
scrutiny
failed
to
discover
any
opening
from
which
that
slipper
might
have
been
flung
the
region
is
so
decorous
and
acts
of
violence
are
so
foreign
to
its
dignity
and
repose
that
i
could
scarce
believe
that
i
held
that
bit
of
tan
leather
in
my
hand
nor
did
its
unaccountable
precipitation
into
the
street
seem
the
act
of
a
housemaid
nor
could
i
believe
that
a
nursery
governess
had
thus
sought
diversion
from
the
roof
above
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
not
knowing
how
to
meet
this
emergency
then
i
boldly
attacked
the
bell
of
the
house
from
which
i
believed
the
slipper
to
have
proceeded
i
rang
until
a
policeman
whose
speech
was
fragrant
of
the
irish
coasts
bade
me
desist
informing
me
that
the
family
had
only
the
previous
day
left
for
the
shore
the
house
he
assured
me
was
utterly
vacant
that
miss
hollister
is
all
there
is
of
the
story
but
ever
since
i
have
carried
that
slipper
with
me
it
was
in
my
pocket
as
i
traversed
the
upper
halls
of
your
house
seeking
the
ghost
of
that
british
soldier
and
i
had
just
discovered
my
loss
when
i
heard
you
calling
in
returning
it
you
have
conferred
upon
me
the
greatest
imaginable
favor
i
have
faith
that
sometime
somewhere
i
shall
find
the
owner
of
that
slipper
would
you
not
infer
from
its
diminutive
size
and
the
fine
suggestive
delicacy
of
its
outlines
that
the
owner
is
a
person
of
aristocratic
lineage
and
of
breeding
i
will
confess
that
nothing
is
nearer
my
heart
than
the
hope
that
one
day
i
shall
meet
the
young
lady
i
am
sure
she
must
be
young
who
wore
that
slipper
and
dropped
it
as
it
seemed
from
the
clouds
at
my
feet
there
in
sedate
beacon
street
that
most
solemn
of
residential
sanctuaries
ames
began
miss
hollister
instantly
with
an
assumed
severity
that
her
smile
belied
i
can
not
recall
that
my
niece
hezekiah
ever
visited
in
beacon
street
yet
i
dare
say
that
if
she
had
done
so
and
a
young
man
of
your
pleasing
appearance
had
passed
beneath
her
window
one
of
her
slippers
might
very
easily
have
become
detached
from
hezekiah
foot
and
fallen
with
a
nice
calculation
directly
in
front
of
you
but
now
ames
will
you
kindly
carry
your
candle
into
that
and
i
had
been
pluming
myself
upon
the
completeness
of
my
hollisterization
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
to
obey
and
my
heart
sank
as
my
imagination
pictured
hezekiah
discomfiture
when
we
should
find
her
seated
on
the
huge
trunk
behind
the
door
and
that
stockinged
foot
already
called
in
appealing
accents
to
the
shoe
i
held
in
my
hand
the
foundations
of
the
world
shook
as
i
remembered
the
compact
by
which
hezekiah
was
excluded
from
the
house
and
realized
what
the
impending
discovery
would
mean
to
cecilia
her
father
and
the
wayward
hezekiah
too
but
i
was
in
for
it
miss
octavia
indicated
by
an
imperious
nod
that
i
was
to
precede
her
into
the
and
i
strode
before
her
with
my
candle
held
high
but
the
sprites
of
mystery
were
still
abroad
at
hopefield
the
room
was
unoccupied
save
for
the
trunks
hezekiah
had
vanished
instead
of
sitting
there
to
await
the
coming
of
her
aunt
she
had
silently
departed
without
leaving
a
trace
miss
hollister
glanced
up
at
the
in
the
ceiling
and
so
did
i
it
was
closed
but
i
did
not
doubt
that
hezekiah
had
crawled
through
it
and
taken
herself
to
the
roof
miss
octavia
would
probably
order
me
at
once
to
the
battlements
but
worse
was
to
come
ames
she
said
will
you
kindly
lift
the
lid
of
that
largest
trunk
i
had
not
thought
of
this
and
i
shuddered
at
the
possibilities
she
indicated
the
trunk
upon
which
hezekiah
had
sat
and
nibbled
her
cracker
not
more
than
ten
minutes
before
could
it
be
possible
that
when
i
lifted
the
cover
that
golden
head
would
be
found
beneath
my
life
has
known
no
blacker
moment
than
that
in
which
i
flung
back
the
lid
of
that
trunk
i
averted
my
eyes
in
dread
of
the
impending
disclosure
and
held
the
candle
close
but
the
trunk
was
empty
incredibly
empty
my
courage
rose
again
and
i
glanced
at
miss
octavia
triumphantly
i
even
jerked
out
the
trays
to
allay
any
lingering
suspicion
why
had
i
ever
doubted
hezekiah
who
was
she
the
daughter
of
kings
to
be
caught
in
a
trunk
she
had
slipped
up
the
ladder
while
i
talked
to
her
aunt
and
was
even
now
hiding
on
the
roof
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
make
so
treasonable
a
suggestion
miss
octavia
might
press
the
matter
further
if
she
liked
but
i
would
not
help
her
to
trap
hezekiah
miss
hollister
did
not
to
my
surprise
and
relief
suggest
an
inspection
of
the
roof
she
nodded
her
head
gravely
and
passed
out
into
the
hall
ames
if
i
implied
a
moment
ago
that
i
doubted
your
story
of
the
dropping
of
that
tan
pump
from
a
beacon
street
roof
or
window
i
now
tender
you
my
sincerest
apologies
she
put
out
her
hand
smiling
charmingly
pray
return
to
the
occupations
which
were
engaging
you
when
i
interrupted
you
you
have
never
stood
higher
in
my
regard
than
at
this
moment
you
may
tell
me
all
you
please
of
the
ghost
and
the
mysteries
of
this
house
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
find
the
bones
of
that
british
soldier
somewhere
beneath
the
foundations
as
for
that
trifling
bit
of
leather
you
hold
in
your
hand
it
rather
passé
for
beacon
street
the
next
time
you
tell
that
story
i
suggest
that
you
play
your
game
of
drop
the
slipper
from
a
window
in
rittenhouse
square
philadelphia
still
as
i
always
keep
an
umbrella
in
the
of
the
parker
house
i
would
not
have
you
imagine
that
i
look
upon
boston
as
an
unlikely
scene
for
romance
the
last
time
i
was
there
a
mormon
missionary
pressed
a
tract
upon
me
in
the
subway
and
i
ca
deny
that
i
found
it
immensely
interesting
xv
loss
of
the
silver
hezekiah
on
the
roof
was
safe
for
a
time
miss
octavia
gentle
rejection
of
my
beacon
street
anecdote
and
her
intimation
that
hezekiah
had
been
an
unbilled
participant
in
the
comedy
of
the
ghost
had
been
disquieting
and
in
my
relief
at
her
abandonment
of
the
search
i
loitered
on
downstairs
with
my
hostess
i
wished
to
impress
her
with
the
idea
that
i
was
without
urgent
business
hezekiah
would
beyond
doubt
amuse
herself
after
her
own
fashion
on
the
roof
until
i
was
ready
to
release
her
as
i
had
quietly
locked
the
door
and
carried
the
key
in
my
pocket
i
was
reasonably
sure
of
this
humility
is
best
acquired
through
tribulation
and
as
hezekiah
sat
among
the
nursing
one
stockinged
foot
and
waiting
for
me
to
turn
up
with
her
lost
slipper
it
would
do
her
no
harm
to
nibble
the
bitter
fruit
of
repentance
with
another
biscuit
i
should
find
her
much
less
sure
of
herself
when
i
saw
fit
to
seek
her
on
the
roof
it
was
a
pretty
comedy
we
were
playing
but
it
was
best
that
she
should
not
too
complacently
take
all
the
curtains
hezekiah
naughtiness
had
been
diverting
up
to
a
point
now
reached
and
passed
but
the
time
had
arrived
for
remonstrance
admonition
discipline
and
it
should
be
my
grateful
task
to
point
out
the
error
of
her
ways
and
urge
her
into
safer
avenues
of
conduct
such
were
my
reflections
as
i
attended
miss
octavia
in
her
descent
the
memoranda
of
my
adventures
at
hopefield
manor
fall
under
two
general
headings
on
the
one
hand
was
the
ghost
and
the
library
chimney
on
the
other
the
extraordinary
gathering
of
cecilia
suitors
as
i
followed
at
miss
octavia
side
she
seemed
to
have
dismissed
the
ghost
and
the
fractious
chimney
from
her
mind
her
humor
changed
completely
as
in
the
morning
when
unaccountably
abandoning
her
habitual
speech
she
had
asked
me
about
cecilia
silver
she
seemed
troubled
and
when
we
had
reached
the
second
floor
she
paused
and
lost
herself
in
unwonted
preoccupation
let
us
sit
here
a
moment
she
said
indicating
a
long
davenport
in
the
broad
hall
for
the
first
time
her
manner
betrayed
weariness
she
laid
her
hand
quietly
on
my
arm
and
looked
at
me
fixedly
arnold
she
said
you
will
let
me
call
you
arnold
wo
you
she
added
plaintively
and
never
in
my
life
had
i
been
so
touched
by
anything
so
sweet
and
gentle
and
kind
arnold
if
an
old
woman
like
me
should
do
a
very
foolish
thing
in
following
her
own
whims
and
then
find
that
she
had
probably
committed
herself
to
a
course
likely
to
cause
unhappiness
what
would
you
advise
her
to
do
about
it
miss
hollister
i
answered
if
you
trusted
providence
this
morning
to
send
you
a
corps
of
servants
when
yours
had
been
most
unfortunately
scattered
by
ghosts
or
rumors
of
ghosts
why
will
you
not
continue
to
have
confidence
that
your
affairs
will
always
be
directed
by
agencies
equally
alert
and
beneficent
she
flashed
upon
me
that
rare
wonderful
smile
of
hers
she
looked
me
in
the
eyes
quizzically
with
her
head
bent
slightly
to
one
side
but
for
once
her
usual
readiness
seemed
to
have
forsaken
her
could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
losing
faith
in
her
own
and
that
the
tuneful
trumpets
of
adventure
and
romance
which
she
had
set
vibrating
on
her
own
key
jarred
dully
in
her
ears
it
passed
swiftly
through
my
mind
that
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
win
her
back
to
complete
belief
in
the
potency
of
the
oracles
that
had
called
to
her
old
age
she
had
dipped
her
paddle
into
bright
waters
and
had
splashed
up
all
manner
of
gay
imaginings
and
what
disasters
awaited
her
now
if
she
beached
her
argosy
and
found
no
gold
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
it
occurred
to
me
prosaic
man
and
that
i
was
that
no
one
should
be
disappointed
who
has
heard
the
calling
at
twilight
or
wakened
to
the
chanting
of
the
or
heard
the
timbers
creaking
in
the
stout
old
caravel
of
romance
as
it
wallows
in
the
seas
that
wash
the
happy
isles
i
had
not
crawled
through
so
many
chimneys
but
that
i
still
believed
that
dreams
come
true
not
because
they
will
but
because
they
must
and
in
the
case
of
miss
octavia
hollister
i
felt
a
great
responsibility
for
what
irremediable
loss
might
not
result
to
a
world
too
little
given
these
days
to
dreaming
if
she
who
at
sixty
had
turned
her
heart
trustfully
to
adventure
should
find
only
sorrow
and
disappointment
the
thing
must
not
be
i
was
feeling
the
least
bit
elated
over
my
success
in
solving
the
riddle
of
the
ghost
and
i
knew
that
the
hidden
chambers
and
stair
would
delight
her
when
i
revealed
them
on
the
morrow
so
i
quite
honestly
sought
to
restore
her
to
the
joy
of
life
i
felt
that
she
was
waiting
for
me
to
speak
further
and
i
plunged
ahead
our
meeting
in
the
asolando
was
the
most
interesting
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
miss
hollister
i
was
rapidly
becoming
hopelessly
cabined
cribbed
confined
bound
in
to
saucy
doubts
and
fears
as
to
the
promise
of
life
held
out
to
us
in
the
nursery
where
indeed
all
education
should
begin
and
end
your
appearance
at
the
asolando
that
afternoon
was
to
save
me
from
death
in
a
world
that
was
rapidly
losing
for
me
all
its
illusion
and
witchery
but
now
that
you
have
so
readily
won
me
back
to
the
true
faith
i
beg
of
you
do
not
yourself
revert
to
the
dreary
workaday
world
from
which
you
rescued
me
i
had
never
in
my
life
spoken
more
sincerely
i
had
never
been
so
happy
as
since
i
knew
her
and
i
was
pleading
for
myself
as
well
as
for
her
there
where
from
her
own
doorstep
and
in
her
own
garden
one
who
listened
attentively
might
hear
the
faint
roar
of
trains
bound
toward
the
teeming
city
along
iron
highways
it
was
with
relief
that
i
saw
my
words
had
struck
home
she
touched
my
hand
lightly
then
she
took
it
in
both
her
own
you
really
believe
that
you
are
not
merely
trying
to
please
me
i
was
never
half
so
much
in
earnest
please
go
on
in
the
way
you
have
begun
and
have
no
fear
that
the
charts
will
mislead
you
or
that
the
seas
will
grind
your
bark
on
hidden
shoals
shipwreck
you
know
is
one
of
the
greatest
joys
of
our
adventures
we
have
to
be
wrecked
first
before
we
find
the
island
of
the
she
sighed
softly
but
i
felt
that
her
spirits
were
rising
but
those
men
down
there
how
shall
i
manage
that
she
asked
eagerly
i
snapped
my
fingers
we
must
get
back
into
the
air
again
and
it
was
remarkable
how
readily
my
wings
bore
me
upward
the
earth
after
all
does
not
bind
us
so
fast
i
do
know
the
game
but
i
have
found
out
a
lot
of
things
without
being
told
so
tell
me
nothing
remember
that
i
have
something
quite
remarkable
startling
even
to
show
you
i
have
even
overcome
you
know
the
obstacle
you
placed
in
the
way
of
my
discoveries
by
sending
in
ahead
of
me
this
morning
for
the
plans
of
the
house
i
watched
her
narrowly
but
she
was
in
no
wise
discomfited
well
i
burned
them
the
moment
hilda
brought
them
back
she
laughed
i
had
faith
in
you
and
i
wanted
you
to
manage
it
all
for
yourself
i
rather
guessed
that
you
would
go
to
pepperton
that
was
when
i
still
believed
but
you
must
go
on
believing
is
the
main
cornerstone
and
the
keystone
of
the
arch
of
the
happy
life
you
are
sure
you
are
not
mocking
a
foolish
old
woman
you
are
the
wisest
woman
i
ever
knew
i
asserted
and
my
heart
was
in
the
words
i
believe
you
have
persuaded
me
but
cecilia
she
was
again
at
the
point
of
loosening
her
hold
upon
the
cord
that
linked
her
shallop
to
ariel
isle
but
my
own
youth
was
resurgent
in
me
i
rose
hastily
the
better
to
break
the
current
of
her
thought
those
men
down
there
they
are
in
the
hands
of
a
higher
fate
than
we
control
i
do
know
the
game
but
if
she
broke
in
but
if
you
gave
away
the
secret
explained
it
to
me
you
would
throw
me
back
into
my
darkest
chimney
to
hope
no
more
leave
it
to
me
trust
me
lean
upon
me
i
assure
you
that
all
will
be
well
she
bent
her
head
and
yielded
herself
to
reverie
for
a
moment
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
that
indescribably
light
graceful
way
that
erased
at
least
fifty
of
her
years
from
the
reckoning
and
was
herself
again
arnold
ames
she
said
laughing
a
little
but
gazing
up
at
me
with
unmistakable
confidence
and
liking
in
her
eyes
we
will
go
through
with
this
to
the
end
and
whether
that
slipper
really
fell
at
your
feet
in
beacon
street
or
in
the
even
less
likely
precincts
of
rittenhouse
square
or
under
the
windows
of
the
spanish
embassy
in
washington
i
believe
that
you
are
my
good
knight
and
that
you
will
see
me
safely
through
this
singular
adventure
and
i
arnold
ames
but
lately
a
student
of
chimneys
bent
and
kissed
miss
octavia
hand
illustration
and
i
bent
and
kissed
miss
octavia
hand
she
led
the
way
to
the
library
where
i
thought
it
well
to
appear
for
a
moment
and
i
was
heartily
glad
that
i
did
so
it
was
joy
enough
for
any
man
that
he
should
have
earned
such
glances
of
hatred
and
suspicion
as
the
suitors
bent
upon
me
there
they
were
some
standing
some
seated
about
cecilia
i
bowed
low
from
the
door
feeling
that
to
offer
my
hand
to
these
gentlemen
in
their
present
temper
would
be
too
severe
a
strain
upon
their
manners
as
miss
octavia
appeared
several
of
them
advanced
courteously
and
engaged
her
in
conversation
she
found
a
seat
and
called
the
others
to
her
on
the
plea
that
she
wished
to
ask
them
their
opinion
touching
some
matter
i
believe
it
was
a
late
rumor
that
andree
who
had
gone
ballooning
to
discover
the
hyperboreans
had
been
heard
of
somewhere
cecilia
appeared
distrait
and
i
wondered
what
new
turn
her
affairs
had
taken
she
rose
as
i
crossed
the
room
and
from
her
manner
i
judged
that
she
welcomed
this
chance
of
addressing
me
you
have
scorned
the
library
has
there
been
trouble
is
aunt
octavia
alarmed
about
anything
i
was
sure
that
this
inquiry
covered
some
ulterior
question
hartley
wiggins
listening
with
a
bored
air
to
miss
octavia
discussion
of
andree
fate
glanced
in
our
direction
with
manifest
displeasure
in
our
propinquity
cecilia
hollister
was
a
beautiful
charming
woman
of
the
world
but
i
felt
her
spell
less
it
may
be
that
the
presence
of
hezekiah
slipper
in
my
inside
pressing
rather
insistently
against
my
ribs
acted
as
a
i
certainly
could
not
imagine
myself
possessed
of
one
of
slippers
if
i
had
tried
my
fictitious
beacon
street
episode
on
cecilia
she
would
undoubtedly
have
expressed
her
scorn
of
me
the
hollisteritis
germ
that
had
heretofore
infected
me
only
intermittently
was
now
exerting
its
full
tonic
power
in
trying
to
hold
miss
octavia
to
her
covenants
with
the
lords
of
romance
i
had
strengthened
my
own
confidence
in
their
bold
emprise
the
gravity
with
which
the
suitors
gave
heed
to
miss
octavia
ideas
on
arctic
ballooning
touched
my
humor
cecilia
had
but
to
state
her
perplexity
and
i
would
interest
myself
promptly
in
her
business
if
i
had
been
asked
that
night
to
enlist
in
the
most
hopeless
causes
i
should
have
done
so
without
a
quibble
and
died
cheerfully
under
any
barricade
our
time
was
short
at
any
moment
the
suitors
might
cease
covertly
glaring
at
me
drift
away
from
miss
octavia
and
interpose
themselves
between
me
and
the
girl
on
whom
they
had
set
their
collective
hearts
you
are
in
difficulty
miss
cecilia
i
said
please
tell
me
in
what
way
i
may
serve
you
i
do
know
why
i
should
appeal
to
you
no
reason
is
necessary
i
have
told
you
before
that
you
need
only
to
command
me
we
may
be
interrupted
at
any
moment
pray
go
on
i
have
lost
an
article
of
the
greatest
value
to
me
it
has
been
taken
from
my
room
for
a
moment
only
i
read
distrust
and
suspicion
in
her
eyes
as
it
occurred
to
her
that
i
had
access
to
every
part
of
the
house
but
my
manner
seemed
to
restore
her
confidence
and
she
could
not
have
forgotten
that
her
own
father
had
met
her
secretly
on
the
roof
of
a
house
that
was
denied
him
and
that
i
was
perfectly
cognizant
of
the
fact
i
am
sure
you
can
be
of
assistance
she
said
there
something
behind
this
some
one
has
been
in
and
about
the
house
you
believe
that
yes
there
has
really
been
a
sort
of
ghost
you
know
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
cecilia
had
no
patience
with
ghosts
and
we
were
losing
time
my
conversation
with
cecilia
was
annoying
wiggins
as
was
plain
from
his
nervousness
wiggins
courtesy
was
unfailing
but
there
are
points
at
which
the
restraints
of
civilization
snap
cecilia
realized
that
time
passed
and
that
she
had
not
stated
her
difficulty
she
now
lowered
her
voice
and
spoke
with
great
earnestness
i
went
to
my
room
for
a
moment
while
aunt
octavia
was
above
with
you
i
suppose
just
after
the
chimney
gave
another
of
its
strange
demonstrations
i
remembered
that
i
had
left
my
little
book
that
i
usually
carry
with
me
on
my
table
it
contains
a
memorandum
of
great
importance
to
me
it
positively
can
not
be
duplicated
i
am
sure
it
was
there
when
i
came
down
to
dinner
but
it
was
not
on
my
or
anywhere
to
be
found
you
may
be
mistaken
as
to
where
you
left
it
you
would
not
be
absolutely
positive
that
you
left
it
on
the
there
is
not
the
slightest
question
about
it
i
had
been
looking
at
it
just
before
dinner
i
had
sent
you
a
note
you
know
immediately
after
you
came
back
and
hurried
down
to
see
you
yes
i
recall
that
you
were
in
the
library
when
i
came
down
and
i
think
i
remember
having
seen
the
little
trinket
slightly
smaller
than
a
and
only
a
few
leaves
you
had
it
in
your
hand
the
other
night
when
i
came
in
after
hume
had
left
she
flushed
slightly
at
this
but
readily
acquiesced
in
my
description
miss
octavia
inquiry
as
to
whether
i
had
seen
the
book
came
back
to
me
and
no
less
clearly
her
withdrawal
of
her
question
almost
the
moment
she
had
spoken
it
i
felt
the
sudden
impingement
of
hezekiah
slipper
upon
my
own
conscience
if
i
may
so
state
the
matter
hezekiah
playing
ghost
had
confessed
to
me
that
she
had
visited
cecilia
room
hezekiah
amusing
herself
with
the
library
chimney
and
frightening
the
servants
by
stealing
into
the
forbidden
house
through
the
was
a
culprit
to
be
scolded
and
forgiven
but
what
of
hezekiah
mischievously
filching
an
article
of
real
value
to
her
sister
i
did
not
like
this
turn
of
affairs
i
must
get
back
to
the
roof
find
hezekiah
and
compel
her
to
return
the
silver
book
only
by
tactfully
managing
this
could
i
serve
well
all
the
members
of
the
house
of
hollister
but
first
i
must
leave
cecilia
with
a
tranquil
mind
i
thank
you
for
confiding
this
matter
to
me
miss
hollister
please
do
not
attach
suspicion
to
any
one
until
i
have
seen
you
again
but
if
you
should
be
unable
to
restore
i
assure
you
that
the
book
is
not
lost
it
has
been
mislaid
all
i
shall
return
it
to
you
at
breakfast
i
give
you
my
word
do
you
really
mean
it
she
faltered
please
keep
this
from
aunt
octavia
i
ca
tell
you
how
important
it
is
that
she
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
my
loss
the
consequences
if
she
knew
might
be
very
distressing
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
what
great
importance
could
attach
to
those
few
leaves
of
paper
in
their
silver
case
but
if
miss
octavia
and
hezekiah
were
interested
in
it
as
well
as
cecilia
it
must
have
a
significance
wholly
unrelated
to
its
intrinsic
value
it
is
the
way
of
professional
detectives
to
suggest
impossible
theories
merely
to
conceal
their
own
plans
and
intentions
and
as
i
had
reached
a
point
where
my
tongue
was
astonishingly
glib
in
subterfuge
and
evasion
i
suggested
that
it
might
perhaps
have
been
one
of
the
new
servants
or
indeed
the
swedish
maid
we
will
look
into
the
matter
miss
hollister
at
breakfast
i
shall
have
something
to
report
meanwhile
silence
is
the
word
miss
octavia
was
carrying
the
invincible
john
stewart
dick
away
to
the
he
glared
at
me
murderously
as
he
trailed
glumly
after
the
lady
of
the
manor
the
others
were
crowding
about
cecilia
again
and
i
yielded
to
them
willingly
as
i
sauntered
toward
the
door
ormsby
detained
me
a
moment
his
manner
was
arrogant
and
he
hissed
rather
than
spoke
i
directed
to
command
your
presence
at
the
prescott
arms
at
twelve
the
business
is
important
i
regret
my
dear
brother
that
i
shall
be
unable
to
sit
with
you
at
that
hour
in
committee
of
the
whole
and
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
i
am
paired
with
lord
arrowood
you
refused
to
take
him
into
your
base
compact
and
allowed
him
to
be
thrown
out
of
the
inn
for
not
paying
his
bill
the
act
was
deficient
in
generosity
and
gallantry
then
i
suppose
you
would
think
it
a
fine
thing
for
such
a
pauper
to
marry
a
woman
like
that
like
that
i
say
and
he
jerked
his
head
toward
cecilia
i
consider
a
lord
of
arrowood
as
good
as
the
proprietor
of
a
any
day
if
you
press
me
for
an
opinion
i
replied
amiably
and
this
from
a
he
sneered
you
flatter
me
my
dear
sir
i
renounced
soot
and
become
a
gentleman
adventurer
merely
to
prevent
a
type
that
long
illumined
popular
fiction
from
becoming
extinct
i
advise
you
to
fill
the
void
existing
in
the
class
believe
me
your
talents
would
carry
you
far
study
dumas
and
forget
the
and
you
will
lead
a
happier
life
my
second
reason
for
declining
to
meet
you
at
the
arms
at
twelve
is
merely
that
the
hour
is
inconvenient
i
assume
that
you
mean
to
urge
luncheon
upon
me
and
i
never
eat
before
one
my
doctor
has
warned
me
to
avoid
early
luncheons
if
i
would
preserve
my
figure
of
which
you
may
well
believe
me
justly
proud
you
a
coward
that
all
there
is
to
that
i
dare
you
to
come
well
as
i
think
of
it
i
rather
be
dared
than
invited
if
i
find
it
quite
convenient
i
shall
drop
in
but
you
need
keep
the
waffles
hot
for
me
good
evening
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
i
the
timid
uncombative
and
unathletic
had
thus
cavalierly
addressed
a
dignified
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
who
was
perfectly
capable
of
knocking
me
down
with
a
slap
in
the
face
valor
i
aver
is
only
another
of
the
offsprings
of
necessity
xvi
jack
o
lantern
i
hurried
back
to
the
and
had
soon
gained
the
roof
the
moon
was
harassed
by
flying
clouds
that
obscured
it
fitfully
and
a
keen
wind
swept
the
hills
i
crept
over
the
several
levels
of
roof
thinking
that
any
moment
i
should
come
upon
hezekiah
i
searched
a
second
time
peering
behind
and
into
dark
angles
but
to
my
disappointment
and
chagrin
my
young
lady
of
the
single
slipper
was
nowhere
in
sight
i
found
however
lying
near
the
library
chimney
a
that
required
no
explanation
with
this
hezekiah
had
blocked
the
flue
and
i
smiled
as
i
pictured
her
to
reach
the
and
dropping
the
tray
across
the
top
how
gleefully
she
must
have
chuckled
as
she
waited
for
the
flue
to
fill
and
send
the
smoke
ebbing
back
into
the
library
to
the
discomfiture
of
her
aunt
and
sister
and
the
suitors
gathered
about
the
hearth
the
spirit
of
mischief
never
whispered
into
a
prettier
ear
a
trick
better
calculated
to
cause
confusion
i
had
thought
hezekiah
secure
when
i
locked
the
door
but
i
had
not
counted
upon
the
versatility
and
resourcefulness
of
that
young
person
i
dropped
to
the
second
and
inspected
the
but
it
was
incredible
that
she
had
sought
the
earth
by
this
means
i
swung
myself
to
a
third
level
and
after
much
groping
for
my
bearings
decided
that
an
athletic
girl
of
venturesome
disposition
might
if
she
set
no
great
store
by
her
neck
clamber
off
the
by
means
of
a
tall
maple
whose
branches
now
raspingly
called
attention
to
their
slight
contact
with
the
house
it
was
here
that
the
walls
of
hopefield
thrust
themselves
into
the
shoulder
of
a
rough
rocky
knoll
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
now
that
the
chambers
of
the
earlier
house
around
which
the
mansion
had
been
built
were
neatly
enfolded
by
the
walls
on
the
east
side
as
the
moon
cruised
into
a
patch
of
clear
sky
something
white
fluttered
from
a
maple
limb
and
i
bent
and
pulled
it
free
i
took
counsel
of
a
match
behind
the
kitchen
chimney
and
found
that
it
was
a
handkerchief
that
had
been
knotted
to
the
tip
of
the
bough
no
one
but
hezekiah
would
have
thought
of
marking
her
trail
in
this
fashion
i
held
it
to
my
face
and
that
faint
perfume
that
had
been
a
mystifying
accompaniment
of
the
passing
of
the
mansion
ghost
became
nothing
more
unreal
than
the
orris
in
hezekiah
the
wind
whipped
the
bit
of
linen
spitefully
in
my
hands
i
reasoned
that
if
hezekiah
the
inexplicable
had
not
meant
for
me
to
know
the
manner
of
her
exit
she
need
not
have
left
this
plain
hint
behind
but
the
swaying
maple
bough
did
not
tempt
me
i
hurried
back
across
the
roof
to
secure
the
resolved
to
dispose
of
it
seek
the
open
and
find
the
errant
hezekiah
if
she
still
lingered
in
the
neighborhood
i
looked
off
across
the
windy
landscape
before
descending
and
as
my
eyes
ranged
the
dark
i
caught
the
glimmer
of
a
light
as
of
a
lantern
borne
in
the
hand
in
the
meadow
beyond
the
garden
it
paused
and
was
swung
back
and
forth
by
its
unseen
bearer
it
shed
a
curious
yellow
light
and
not
the
white
flame
of
the
common
lantern
and
now
it
rose
a
trifle
higher
and
slowly
resolved
itself
into
a
weird
fantastic
face
three
minutes
later
i
was
out
of
the
house
using
the
backstairs
to
avoid
the
company
in
the
library
and
had
crossed
the
garden
and
crawled
through
the
hedge
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
a
voice
greeted
me
cheerfully
well
done
you
were
a
little
slow
hitting
the
trail
but
you
do
pretty
well
considering
how
did
you
manage
with
aunt
octavia
about
that
slipper
i
had
a
narrow
escape
in
the
hall
when
i
came
out
of
cecilia
room
i
must
have
lowered
a
record
getting
upstairs
and
one
shoe
is
a
bit
comfortable
allow
me
to
relieve
you
here
your
slipper
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
losing
my
slipper
i
thought
cinderella
had
made
that
respectable
she
placed
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
lifted
her
foot
and
drew
the
pump
on
with
a
single
tug
well
what
did
aunt
octavia
say
oh
she
had
thoughts
too
dark
to
express
you
probably
heard
what
we
said
it
was
she
who
found
the
slipper
hezekiah
laughed
the
wind
caught
up
that
laugh
and
whisked
it
away
jealously
she
found
it
and
carried
it
to
you
and
i
skipped
just
as
you
began
that
beautiful
story
about
finding
it
in
beacon
street
hurry
and
tell
me
how
you
got
me
out
of
it
how
did
you
know
i
would
try
to
explain
it
you
did
a
perfectly
foolhardy
thing
in
roaming
the
house
that
way
scaring
lord
arrowood
nearly
to
death
to
say
nothing
of
me
why
should
i
help
you
oh
you
a
man
and
i
was
just
a
little
girl
who
had
lost
her
slipper
she
replied
i
was
sure
you
would
fix
it
up
well
i
like
your
nerve
hezekiah
i
had
to
lie
horribly
to
explain
the
slipper
and
miss
octavia
did
swallow
more
than
half
my
yarn
oh
well
if
it
was
a
good
story
aunt
octavia
would
mind
have
minded
though
if
you
had
tried
to
get
me
out
of
it
the
way
with
aunt
octavia
i
hope
you
made
a
romantic
tale
of
it
i
ca
say
that
it
would
place
me
among
the
great
masters
of
fiction
hezekiah
but
as
lies
go
i
think
it
had
merit
and
i
improve
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
oh
you
stay
all
right
aunt
octavia
has
no
intention
of
letting
you
go
when
she
left
the
asolando
that
afternoon
she
met
you
she
had
her
plans
all
made
for
kidnapping
you
she
did
tell
you
so
did
she
no
because
i
have
seen
her
and
i
not
supposed
to
see
her
you
know
until
cecilia
is
all
fixed
married
um
replied
hezekiah
she
drew
from
behind
a
boulder
by
which
we
stood
a
pumpkin
of
portable
size
which
i
surmised
had
been
carved
into
the
most
hideous
of
jack
lanterns
by
the
shrewd
hand
of
hezekiah
i
took
it
from
her
with
the
excuse
of
relieving
her
but
really
to
turn
the
light
of
the
fearsome
thing
more
directly
upon
her
the
wind
blew
her
hair
about
her
face
hers
was
an
elfish
face
with
a
pleasant
tingling
i
met
her
eyes
the
light
of
a
jack
o
lantern
is
not
of
the
earth
earthy
even
when
you
know
perfectly
well
that
it
only
a
candle
stuck
in
a
pumpkin
you
are
not
fully
satisfied
of
its
mundane
character
in
its
glow
one
becomes
a
conspirator
ready
for
treason
stratagems
and
spoils
more
concretely
in
these
moments
a
small
archipelago
of
freckles
revealed
itself
about
hezekiah
nose
and
caused
my
heart
to
palpitate
strangely
her
cheek
was
perilously
near
i
hoped
that
she
would
bend
forever
over
the
lantern
so
that
i
might
not
lose
the
tiny
shadows
of
her
lashes
or
again
the
laughter
of
her
brown
eyes
as
she
glanced
up
to
ask
my
judgment
as
to
the
security
of
the
candle
she
viewed
her
handiwork
with
feigned
solicitude
the
tip
of
her
tongue
showing
between
her
lips
then
the
mirth
in
her
bubbled
out
and
she
drew
away
and
clapped
her
hands
together
like
a
child
come
she
cried
if
you
are
good
and
wo
begin
preaching
about
my
sins
i
show
you
the
funniest
thing
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
in
my
joy
of
seeing
her
i
was
neglecting
cecilia
commission
very
likely
hezekiah
had
forgotten
all
about
her
theft
hers
i
reasoned
was
a
nature
that
delighted
in
the
nearest
pleasure
i
would
follow
her
jack
o
lantern
round
the
world
for
the
chance
of
seeing
the
fun
brighten
in
her
brown
eyes
but
i
had
made
a
promise
to
cecilia
and
i
meant
to
fulfill
it
she
led
me
now
across
the
meadow
over
a
stone
wall
up
a
steep
slope
and
by
devious
ways
through
a
strip
of
woodland
i
bore
the
jack
lantern
she
had
bidden
me
do
it
with
some
notion
i
did
not
question
of
making
me
in
whatever
mischief
was
afoot
dignified
conduct
in
a
man
of
in
his
best
evening
clothes
carrying
a
jack
o
lantern
over
stone
walls
under
clumps
of
briar
and
through
woods
whose
boughs
clawed
the
night
wildly
the
moon
lost
and
found
under
the
flying
scud
was
in
keeping
with
the
general
irresponsibility
of
a
world
ruled
by
hezekiah
she
swung
along
ahead
of
me
with
the
greatest
ease
and
certainty
occasionally
she
flung
some
word
back
at
me
or
whistled
a
few
bars
of
a
tune
and
when
i
slipped
and
nearly
fell
on
a
smooth
slope
she
laughed
mockingly
and
bade
me
not
lose
the
pumpkin
once
when
a
boy
i
stole
a
watermelon
and
bore
it
a
mile
to
the
rendezvous
of
my
pirate
band
camped
at
a
riverside
but
carrying
a
pumpkin
even
a
hollow
one
is
attended
with
manifold
discomforts
it
would
help
i
reflected
to
know
just
what
i
was
lugging
it
for
but
hezekiah
vouchsafed
nothing
when
i
threatened
to
drop
the
grinning
gargoyle
she
laughed
and
told
me
to
trot
along
and
not
be
silly
and
a
moment
later
she
stopped
and
demanded
that
i
repeat
fully
the
story
i
had
told
her
aunt
of
the
finding
of
the
slipper
you
are
better
than
i
thought
you
were
she
declared
when
i
had
concluded
and
added
her
aunt
comment
you
may
be
sure
that
tickled
aunt
octavia
you
can
lie
almost
as
well
as
an
architect
aunt
octavia
says
architects
are
better
liars
than
it
was
my
weakness
for
the
truth
that
caused
me
to
abandon
architecture
for
heaven
sake
what
are
you
up
to
i
had
kept
little
account
of
the
direction
of
our
flight
and
i
was
surprised
that
we
had
now
reached
the
stile
over
which
i
had
watched
the
passing
of
the
suitors
on
the
afternoon
of
my
meeting
with
hezekiah
in
the
orchard
this
is
the
appointed
place
she
remarked
taking
the
pumpkin
from
me
and
dropping
down
on
the
far
side
of
the
stile
hezekiah
i
trotted
across
most
of
westchester
county
after
you
and
my
arm
is
paralyzed
from
carrying
that
pumpkin
i
must
know
what
you
up
to
right
here
or
i
go
home
besides
there
a
mist
falling
and
you
be
soaked
what
do
you
suppose
your
father
thinks
of
your
absence
at
this
time
of
night
oh
he
never
forgive
me
for
not
letting
him
in
on
this
this
is
the
grandest
thing
i
ever
thought
of
sit
on
this
step
and
gently
incline
your
ear
toward
the
house
it
about
time
those
gentlemen
were
leaving
cecilia
and
they
be
galloping
for
their
inn
in
a
minute
and
then
hezekiah
whistled
the
rest
of
it
while
we
waited
she
bade
me
reset
the
candle
and
snuff
the
wick
which
i
did
of
necessity
with
my
fingers
sitting
on
a
stile
with
a
pretty
girl
is
an
experience
that
has
been
commended
by
the
balladists
but
surely
this
felicity
loses
nothing
where
the
night
is
fine
when
you
get
used
to
sitting
in
a
drizzle
in
your
while
your
assumes
the
consistency
of
a
gum
shoe
and
your
collar
glues
itself
odiously
to
your
neck
i
dare
say
the
ordeal
may
be
borne
cheerfully
but
my
expressions
of
discomfort
seemed
only
to
amuse
hezekiah
while
we
waited
for
i
knew
not
what
i
tried
once
or
twice
to
revert
to
the
silver
but
without
success
hezekiah
was
a
mistress
of
the
art
of
evasion
with
her
tongue
as
well
as
her
feet
wait
till
the
evening
performance
is
over
and
i
talk
about
that
quiet
crawl
over
there
out
of
the
way
and
when
i
say
run
beat
it
for
the
road
these
last
phrases
were
uttered
in
a
whisper
her
face
close
to
my
ear
she
gave
me
a
little
push
and
i
withdrew
a
few
yards
and
waited
the
ground
i
may
say
was
wet
and
the
drizzle
had
become
a
monotonous
autumn
rain
the
light
of
the
lantern
fell
warmly
upon
hezekiah
face
as
she
held
its
illumined
countenance
toward
her
crouching
on
the
i
heard
now
what
her
keener
ear
had
caught
earlier
the
tramp
of
feet
along
the
path
the
suitors
were
returning
to
the
inn
and
the
voices
of
one
or
two
of
them
reached
me
one
i
thought
it
was
ormsby
was
execrating
the
weather
they
were
stepping
along
briskly
and
my
remembrance
of
their
retreat
over
this
same
stile
through
the
amber
evening
dusk
was
so
vivid
that
i
knew
just
how
they
would
appear
if
a
light
suddenly
fell
upon
the
path
illustration
the
light
of
the
lantern
fell
warmly
upon
face
the
nature
of
hezekiah
undertaking
suddenly
dawned
upon
me
no
one
but
hezekiah
could
ever
have
devised
anything
so
preposterous
so
utterly
lawless
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
waited
in
breathless
eagerness
for
the
outcome
i
could
not
have
interfered
now
if
i
had
wished
to
do
so
without
betraying
her
and
involving
myself
in
a
predicament
that
could
not
redound
to
my
credit
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
patter
of
feet
and
i
heard
for
i
could
not
see
the
scraping
of
hezekiah
slipper
a
wet
little
shoe
by
now
as
she
crept
higher
on
our
side
of
the
stile
the
first
suitor
groped
blindly
for
the
steps
slipped
on
the
wet
plank
growled
and
rose
to
try
again
that
growl
marked
for
me
the
leader
of
the
van
hartley
wiggins
beyond
a
doubt
and
in
no
good
humor
i
guessed
the
others
i
judged
had
trodden
upon
one
another
heels
at
the
moment
wiggins
stumbled
thus
let
us
imagine
their
approach
six
gentlemen
in
top
hats
headed
for
a
stile
on
a
chilly
night
of
rain
it
was
at
this
strategic
moment
that
hezekiah
pushed
into
the
middle
of
the
its
grinning
face
turned
toward
the
advancing
suitors
the
jack
o
lantern
her
hand
had
fashioned
i
marked
its
position
by
its
faint
glow
an
instant
but
an
instant
only
the
world
reeled
for
a
moment
before
the
sharp
cry
of
a
man
in
fear
it
cut
the
dark
like
a
lash
and
close
upon
it
the
second
man
yelled
in
a
different
key
but
no
less
in
accents
of
terror
the
first
arrival
had
flung
himself
back
and
so
close
upon
him
pressed
the
others
and
so
unexpected
was
the
halt
that
the
nine
men
seemed
to
have
flung
themselves
together
and
to
be
struggling
to
escape
from
the
hideous
thing
that
had
interposed
itself
in
their
path
all
was
over
in
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
the
panic
the
lantern
winked
out
and
instantly
hezekiah
was
beside
me
skip
she
commanded
in
a
whisper
and
catching
my
hand
she
led
me
off
at
a
brisk
run
when
we
had
gone
a
dozen
rods
she
paused
we
heard
voices
from
the
stile
where
the
gentlemen
were
still
engaged
in
disentangling
themselves
and
then
the
planks
boomed
to
their
steps
as
they
crossed
they
talked
loudly
among
themselves
discussing
the
cause
of
their
discomfiture
the
lantern
i
may
add
had
been
knocked
off
the
stile
by
the
thoughtful
hezekiah
when
she
blew
out
the
light
a
moment
more
and
all
sounds
of
the
suitors
had
died
away
i
stood
alone
with
hezekiah
in
the
midst
of
a
meadow
she
was
breathing
hard
suddenly
she
threw
up
her
head
struck
her
hands
together
and
stamped
her
foot
upon
the
wet
sod
i
had
waited
for
an
outburst
of
laughter
now
that
we
were
safely
out
of
the
way
but
i
had
reasoned
without
my
hezekiah
her
mood
was
not
the
mood
of
mirth
well
hezekiah
i
said
when
i
had
got
my
wind
you
pulled
off
your
joke
but
you
do
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
what
the
matter
oh
that
hartley
wiggins
i
might
have
known
it
known
what
i
asked
pricking
up
my
ears
that
he
would
be
afraid
of
a
pumpkin
with
a
candle
inside
of
it
did
you
hear
that
yell
anybody
would
have
yelled
i
suggested
i
think
i
should
have
dropped
dead
if
you
tried
it
on
me
no
you
would
she
asserted
with
unexpected
flattery
do
be
deceived
hezekiah
i
should
have
been
scared
to
death
if
that
thing
had
popped
up
in
front
of
me
i
do
believe
it
i
gave
you
a
worse
test
than
that
when
i
switched
off
the
lights
and
swung
a
feather
duster
down
the
by
a
string
and
tickled
your
face
you
did
make
a
noise
like
a
circus
calliope
scaring
horses
in
main
street
podunk
but
that
wiggins
man
he
a
friend
of
mine
and
as
brave
as
a
lion
out
in
dakota
the
sheriff
used
to
get
him
to
go
in
and
quiet
things
when
the
boys
were
shooting
up
the
town
maybe
but
he
shied
at
a
pumpkin
and
can
be
no
true
knight
of
mine
cecilia
may
have
him
i
always
suspected
that
he
was
the
real
thing
why
he
even
afraid
of
aunt
octavia
well
i
rather
think
better
be
i
wanted
to
laugh
but
i
did
not
dare
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
humor
in
which
the
panic
of
the
suitors
had
left
her
i
did
not
quite
make
out
and
i
am
uncertain
to
this
day
whether
she
had
really
wished
to
test
the
courage
of
her
sister
lovers
or
whether
she
had
yielded
to
a
mischievous
impulse
in
carrying
the
jack
o
lantern
to
the
stile
and
thrusting
it
before
those
gentlemen
as
they
returned
from
hopefield
in
any
event
hartley
wiggins
was
out
of
it
so
far
as
she
hezekiah
was
concerned
she
trudged
doggedly
across
the
field
until
we
came
presently
to
the
highway
my
wheel
in
the
weeds
somewhere
please
pull
it
out
for
me
going
home
but
not
alone
i
ca
let
you
do
that
hezekiah
oh
cheer
up
she
laughed
aroused
by
my
lugubrious
tone
and
here
something
you
asked
me
for
do
drop
it
it
give
it
back
to
her
and
be
sure
no
one
sees
it
and
you
need
look
into
it
yourself
and
we
got
to
have
a
talk
about
it
and
cecilia
let
me
see
there
an
iron
bridge
across
an
arm
of
that
little
lake
over
there
and
just
beyond
it
a
big
fallen
tree
at
nine
i
be
there
i
got
to
tell
you
something
without
really
telling
you
you
be
there
wo
you
i
be
there
if
i
alive
hezekiah
i
had
found
the
wheel
and
lighted
the
lamp
she
scouted
my
suggestion
that
i
find
a
horse
and
drive
her
home
the
lighting
of
the
lamp
required
time
owing
to
the
wind
and
rain
but
when
its
thin
ribbon
of
light
fell
clearly
upon
the
road
she
seized
the
and
was
ready
to
mount
without
ado
she
gave
me
her
hand
it
was
a
cold
wet
little
hand
but
there
was
a
good
friendly
grip
in
it
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
touched
hezekiah
hand
and
i
mention
it
because
as
i
write
i
feel
again
the
pressure
of
her
slim
cold
fingers
sorry
you
spoiled
your
clothes
but
it
was
in
a
good
cause
and
you
a
nice
boy
she
shot
away
into
the
darkness
and
the
lamp
glow
on
the
road
vanished
in
an
instant
but
before
i
lost
her
quite
her
cheery
whistle
blew
back
to
me
reassuringly
xvii
seven
gold
reeds
i
woke
the
next
morning
to
the
banging
of
miss
octavia
in
spite
of
the
crowding
incidents
of
the
day
and
night
i
had
slept
soundly
and
save
for
a
stiffness
of
the
legs
i
was
none
the
worse
for
my
wetting
the
service
of
the
house
was
perfect
and
in
response
to
my
ring
a
man
appeared
who
declared
himself
competent
to
knock
my
dress
clothes
into
shape
again
i
should
hardly
have
believed
that
so
much
history
had
been
made
in
a
night
if
it
had
not
been
for
certain
indubitable
evidence
silver
hezekiah
handkerchief
which
i
had
forgotten
to
return
to
her
and
a
patch
of
tallow
grease
from
the
jack
o
lantern
that
had
attached
itself
firmly
to
my
cecilia
met
me
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looking
rather
worn
i
thought
we
were
safe
from
interruption
a
moment
longer
as
her
gun
was
still
booming
and
i
followed
her
to
the
library
please
do
tell
me
you
have
failed
she
cried
tearfully
that
little
book
means
so
much
so
very
much
to
us
all
here
it
is
miss
hollister
i
said
placing
it
in
her
hand
without
parley
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
i
return
it
just
as
you
saw
it
last
please
satisfy
yourself
that
it
has
not
been
tampered
with
in
any
way
i
have
not
opened
it
and
it
has
not
left
my
hand
since
i
recovered
it
she
had
almost
snatched
it
from
me
and
she
turned
slightly
away
and
ran
hurriedly
over
the
leaves
in
her
relief
she
laughed
happily
and
with
one
of
her
charming
graceful
gestures
she
gave
me
her
hand
i
thank
you
ames
thank
you
thank
you
you
have
rendered
me
the
greatest
service
and
i
hope
you
were
able
to
do
so
without
serious
inconvenience
to
yourself
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
smallest
matter
and
instead
of
being
a
trouble
i
found
the
greatest
pleasure
in
recovering
it
i
stood
with
my
hands
thrust
carelessly
into
my
trousers
pockets
rocking
slightly
upon
my
heels
to
convey
a
sense
of
the
unimportance
of
my
service
it
was
a
manner
i
had
cultivated
to
meet
the
surprise
and
gratitude
of
my
clients
when
i
had
brought
a
seemingly
incurable
flue
into
a
state
of
subjection
i
think
i
may
have
appeared
a
little
bored
as
though
i
had
accomplished
a
feat
that
was
rather
unworthy
of
my
powers
a
doctor
who
prescribes
the
wrong
pill
and
finds
to
his
amazement
that
it
cures
the
patient
might
improve
upon
that
manner
but
not
greatly
you
naturally
wonder
miss
hollister
how
i
found
this
trinket
so
readily
and
in
order
that
you
may
not
suspect
perfectly
innocent
persons
i
will
tell
you
exactly
how
i
came
by
it
it
was
your
belief
that
you
had
left
it
on
your
but
as
a
of
any
character
pertains
to
a
rather
than
to
a
my
interest
centred
at
once
upon
such
as
you
doubtless
have
in
your
room
there
is
a
in
the
corner
by
the
window
but
ah
you
are
about
to
repeat
your
belief
that
you
left
the
book
on
the
and
that
it
could
not
have
moved
to
the
desk
may
i
ask
whether
you
did
not
just
before
you
came
down
to
dinner
scribble
me
a
line
asking
for
an
interview
why
yes
i
remember
that
perfectly
you
wrote
in
some
haste
as
indicated
by
the
handwriting
in
your
message
it
is
possible
that
you
wrote
and
destroyed
one
note
or
perhaps
two
before
you
had
expressed
yourself
exactly
to
your
liking
we
are
all
of
us
with
any
sort
of
feeling
for
style
prone
to
just
such
rejections
it
is
possible
that
i
did
she
replied
coloring
slightly
i
was
extremely
anxious
to
see
you
very
well
then
is
it
not
possible
that
in
throwing
the
rejected
correspondence
cards
into
the
basket
that
stands
beside
your
desk
there
is
such
a
basket
is
there
not
yes
she
replied
breathlessly
is
it
not
possible
then
that
that
little
booklet
hardly
heavier
than
paper
itself
may
have
been
brushed
off
without
your
seeing
it
it
is
possible
i
must
admit
that
it
is
possible
but
it
is
on
that
that
any
theory
implicating
another
hand
must
break
what
i
have
indicated
is
exactly
what
must
have
happened
to
the
nice
care
that
characterizes
the
of
this
establishment
we
must
now
turn
i
find
that
when
i
go
to
my
own
room
after
dinner
it
is
always
in
perfect
order
pens
restored
to
the
rack
on
my
brushes
laid
straight
on
the
and
so
on
the
maid
who
cares
for
your
room
seeing
scraps
of
paper
in
the
basket
by
your
desk
naturally
carried
it
off
when
i
accepted
your
commission
last
night
i
went
directly
to
the
cellar
sought
the
bin
into
which
waste
paper
is
thrown
and
found
among
old
envelopes
and
other
litter
this
small
trinket
which
but
for
my
promptness
might
have
been
lost
forever
it
does
seem
possible
she
faltered
oh
i
laughed
easily
possible
or
impossible
you
could
not
on
the
swear
that
the
book
had
not
dropped
into
the
basket
precisely
as
i
have
described
no
i
suppose
i
could
she
answered
slowly
my
powers
of
mendacity
were
improving
but
her
relief
at
holding
the
book
again
in
her
hand
was
so
great
that
she
would
probably
have
believed
anything
you
see
she
said
clasping
the
book
tight
this
was
given
me
for
a
particular
purpose
and
it
contains
a
memorandum
of
greatest
importance
and
i
was
in
a
panic
when
i
found
that
it
was
gone
for
my
recollection
of
certain
items
i
had
recorded
here
was
confused
and
there
was
no
possible
way
of
setting
myself
straight
now
all
is
clear
again
i
feel
that
i
make
poor
acknowledgment
of
your
service
but
if
at
any
time
pray
think
no
more
of
it
i
replied
and
at
this
moment
miss
hollister
appeared
and
called
us
to
breakfast
if
it
is
perfectly
agreeable
to
you
arnold
i
will
hear
the
story
of
the
finding
of
the
ghost
at
four
or
just
before
tea
i
have
sent
a
telegram
to
pepperton
asking
him
to
be
present
he
at
his
country
home
in
redding
and
can
very
easily
motor
down
as
no
motors
are
allowed
on
my
premises
he
shall
be
met
at
the
gate
with
a
trap
you
have
sent
for
pepperton
i
exclaimed
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
done
and
as
he
knows
that
i
never
accept
apologies
under
any
circumstances
he
will
not
disappoint
me
in
addition
to
reprimanding
him
for
not
telling
me
of
the
secret
passage
in
this
house
i
have
another
matter
that
concerns
you
arnold
which
i
wish
to
lay
before
him
the
new
cook
that
providence
sent
to
my
kitchen
yesterday
is
the
best
we
have
had
cecilia
and
i
beg
that
you
both
indulge
yourselves
in
a
second
helping
of
country
scrambled
eggs
miss
octavia
made
no
further
allusion
to
the
incidents
of
the
night
but
went
on
turning
over
her
mail
i
have
neglected
to
say
that
her
library
contained
a
most
remarkable
array
of
books
in
praise
of
fortitude
and
daring
i
have
learned
later
that
these
had
been
assembled
for
her
by
a
distinguished
scholar
and
many
of
them
were
rare
editions
a
karlamagnus
saga
elbowed
malory
and
the
reali
di
francia
and
roland
horn
challenged
in
all
languages
she
greatly
admired
and
had
often
visited
the
chateau
de
luynes
and
had
a
portfolio
filled
with
and
drawings
of
it
such
books
as
dictionnaire
du
mobilier
français
i
constantly
found
lying
spread
open
on
the
library
table
she
read
german
and
french
readily
and
declared
her
purpose
to
attack
old
french
that
she
might
pursue
certain
obscure
de
which
an
oxford
professor
had
told
her
were
not
susceptible
of
adequate
translation
why
should
one
read
the
news
of
the
day
when
the
news
of
all
time
was
available
magazines
and
reviews
she
tolerated
but
no
newspaper
was
as
good
as
froissart
she
therefore
read
newspapers
only
through
a
clipping
bureau
which
sent
her
items
bearing
upon
her
own
peculiar
interests
by
some
error
the
story
of
a
heavy
embezzlement
in
a
city
bank
had
that
day
crept
in
among
a
number
of
cuttings
relating
to
a
ship
that
had
been
found
somewhere
off
the
chilean
coast
with
all
sails
set
and
everything
in
perfect
order
but
with
not
a
soul
on
board
she
expressed
her
bitterest
contempt
for
men
in
responsible
positions
who
betrayed
their
trusts
highway
robbery
she
thought
a
much
nobler
crime
as
the
robber
dignified
his
act
by
exposing
himself
to
personal
danger
in
our
day
arnold
she
said
placing
her
knife
and
fork
carefully
on
her
plate
in
our
day
the
ten
commandments
have
lost
their
moral
significance
and
retain
i
fear
only
a
very
slight
literary
interest
she
reminded
cecilia
of
an
appointment
to
ride
that
morning
in
the
early
afternoon
she
was
to
install
a
new
and
otherwise
there
was
a
full
day
ahead
of
her
it
was
a
cheerful
breakfast
table
a
letter
from
my
assistant
confirming
his
telegraphed
resignation
did
not
disturb
me
miss
octavia
showed
no
further
signs
of
abandoning
her
quest
of
the
golden
coasts
of
youth
and
cecilia
having
recovered
her
notebook
faced
the
new
day
cheerfully
a
little
later
i
met
miss
hollister
in
the
hall
dressed
for
her
ride
arnold
you
may
ride
whenever
you
like
i
may
have
forgotten
to
mention
it
what
have
you
on
hand
this
morning
an
appointment
with
a
lady
i
replied
if
you
are
about
to
meet
the
owner
of
that
beacon
street
slipper
i
wish
you
good
luck
she
was
drawing
on
her
gauntlets
and
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile
i
thought
then
she
tapped
me
lightly
with
her
cecilia
silver
was
missing
last
night
she
told
me
of
her
loss
with
tears
she
has
it
again
this
morning
did
you
restore
it
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
do
so
then
allow
me
to
add
my
thanks
to
hers
you
are
an
unusually
practical
person
arnold
ames
as
well
as
the
possessor
of
an
imagination
that
pleases
me
you
are
becoming
more
and
more
essential
to
me
cecilia
approaches
and
i
can
not
say
more
at
this
time
when
they
had
ridden
out
of
the
i
set
off
across
the
fields
to
keep
my
tryst
with
hezekiah
the
air
had
been
washed
sweet
and
clean
by
the
rain
of
the
night
and
sky
was
never
bluer
i
was
surprised
at
my
own
increasing
detachment
from
the
world
nothing
that
had
happened
before
the
asolando
mattered
greatly
my
meeting
with
miss
octavia
hollister
had
marked
a
climacteric
from
which
all
events
must
now
be
reckoned
i
had
embarked
with
high
hope
in
a
profession
to
which
i
had
been
drawn
from
youth
had
failed
utterly
to
find
clients
and
had
therefore
taken
up
the
doctoring
of
flues
a
vocation
whose
honors
are
few
and
dubious
and
in
which
i
felt
it
to
be
damning
praise
that
i
was
called
the
best
in
america
my
days
at
hopefield
were
the
happiest
of
my
life
few
as
they
had
been
they
had
changed
my
gray
bleak
course
into
a
path
bright
with
promise
the
world
had
been
too
much
with
me
and
i
had
escaped
from
it
as
completely
as
though
i
had
stepped
upon
another
planet
where
all
is
possible
and
all
unknown
i
reached
the
fallen
tree
that
hezekiah
had
appointed
as
our
a
little
ahead
of
time
and
indulged
in
pleasant
speculations
while
i
waited
i
was
looking
toward
the
hills
expecting
her
to
come
skimming
along
the
highway
on
her
bicycle
when
a
splash
caused
me
to
turn
to
the
lake
dull
of
me
not
to
have
known
that
hezekiah
would
contrive
a
new
entrance
for
a
scene
so
charmingly
set
as
this
she
had
stolen
upon
me
in
a
light
skiff
and
laughed
to
see
how
her
silent
approach
startled
me
she
dropped
one
oar
and
used
the
other
as
a
paddle
driving
the
boat
with
a
sure
hand
through
the
reeds
into
the
bank
is
morning
and
the
days
are
long
such
was
hezekiah
greeting
as
she
jumped
ashore
she
wore
a
dark
green
skirt
and
coat
and
a
narrow
cravat
tied
under
a
flannel
collar
that
clasped
her
throat
snugly
a
boy
felt
hat
with
the
brim
pinned
up
in
front
covered
her
head
you
seem
none
the
worse
for
your
wetting
hezekiah
you
must
have
been
soaked
so
must
you
chimneys
but
you
look
as
fit
as
i
feel
and
i
never
felt
better
did
they
catch
you
crawling
in
last
night
i
did
see
a
soul
you
know
i
an
old
member
of
the
family
now
nobody
was
ever
as
nice
to
me
as
your
aunt
octavia
how
about
cecilia
having
found
her
silver
and
given
it
back
to
her
before
breakfast
i
may
say
that
our
relations
are
altogether
cordial
are
you
in
love
with
her
yet
asked
hezekiah
carelessly
tossing
a
pebble
into
the
lake
the
yet
was
so
timed
that
it
splashed
with
the
pebble
no
not
yet
i
replied
it
will
come
said
hezekiah
a
little
ruefully
casting
a
pebble
farther
upon
the
crinkled
water
you
mean
hezekiah
that
men
always
fall
in
love
with
your
sister
she
nodded
well
she
a
good
deal
of
a
girl
beautiful
and
no
end
cultivated
they
all
go
crazy
about
her
you
mean
hartley
wiggins
and
his
at
the
prescott
arms
yes
and
lots
of
others
and
sometimes
hezekiah
it
has
seemed
to
you
that
she
got
all
the
admiration
and
that
you
did
get
your
share
so
when
her
suitors
began
a
siege
of
the
castle
whose
gates
were
locked
against
you
you
plugged
the
chimney
with
a
and
played
at
being
ghost
and
otherwise
sought
to
terrify
your
sister
lovers
that
not
nice
chimneys
you
mean
that
i
jealous
no
i
do
mean
that
you
are
jealous
now
i
throw
it
into
the
remote
and
irrevocable
past
you
were
jealous
you
do
care
so
much
now
and
i
hope
you
will
care
less
that
is
being
impertinent
if
you
talk
that
way
i
shall
call
you
ames
and
go
home
you
ca
do
that
hezekiah
i
should
like
to
know
why
not
if
you
say
i
jealous
of
cecilia
now
or
that
i
ever
was
i
shall
be
very
very
angry
for
it
not
true
no
you
see
things
very
differently
now
you
told
me
only
last
night
that
cecilia
might
have
hartley
wiggins
assuming
that
she
wants
him
and
you
and
he
have
been
good
friends
have
you
you
had
good
times
on
the
other
side
and
while
cecilia
was
in
town
assisting
providence
in
finding
your
aunt
a
cook
you
went
walking
with
him
i
did
i
did
mocked
hezekiah
and
why
do
you
suppose
i
did
because
wiggy
the
best
of
fellows
a
solid
substantial
citizen
who
raises
wheat
to
make
bread
out
of
and
angel
food
and
ginger
cookies
added
hezekiah
feeling
absently
in
the
pockets
of
her
coat
no
chimneys
you
a
nice
boy
and
you
do
yell
like
a
wild
man
when
a
hits
you
in
the
dark
but
there
are
some
things
you
do
know
yet
i
am
here
to
grow
wise
at
the
feet
of
hezekiah
daughter
of
kings
open
the
book
of
wisdom
and
teach
me
the
alphabet
but
do
be
sad
if
i
balk
at
the
grammar
i
never
knew
all
the
alphabet
myself
said
hezekiah
dolefully
then
she
laughed
abruptly
i
was
bounced
from
two
convents
and
no
end
of
hudson
river
and
fifth
avenue
education
shops
the
brutality
of
that
hezekiah
wrings
my
heart
yet
you
are
the
best
teacher
i
ever
had
and
i
thought
i
was
educated
when
i
met
you
but
i
had
only
been
to
school
which
is
different
not
until
the
first
time
our
eyes
met
not
until
that
supreme
moment
ames
hezekiah
interrupted
in
the
happiest
possible
imitation
of
miss
octavia
manner
if
you
think
that
because
i
am
a
poor
lone
girl
who
knows
nothing
of
the
great
wide
world
i
am
a
fair
mark
for
your
cajolery
i
assure
you
that
you
were
never
more
mistaken
in
your
life
you
ought
to
mimic
your
aunt
it
is
respectful
and
besides
you
have
something
to
tell
me
what
all
this
rumpus
about
silver
suppose
we
discuss
that
and
get
through
with
it
we
were
sitting
on
the
fallen
tree
which
lay
partly
in
the
lake
and
hezekiah
leaned
over
and
broke
off
a
number
of
reeds
from
the
thicket
at
the
water
edge
out
of
her
pocket
she
drew
a
small
penknife
and
trimmed
them
uniformly
you
see
she
began
biting
her
lip
in
the
earnestness
of
her
labor
i
going
to
tell
you
something
and
yet
i
not
going
to
tell
you
so
far
as
you
and
i
have
gone
you
been
tolerably
satisfactory
if
i
did
think
you
had
some
wits
in
your
head
i
should
have
bothered
with
you
at
all
that
frank
is
it
it
certainly
is
but
i
terribly
fussed
for
fear
i
may
not
be
equal
to
this
new
ordeal
if
you
fail
we
shall
never
meet
again
that
all
there
is
to
that
now
listen
real
hard
you
know
something
about
it
already
but
not
the
main
point
aunt
octavia
got
father
to
consent
to
let
her
marry
us
off
cecilia
and
me
cecilia
being
older
came
first
i
was
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
father
and
i
were
not
to
come
to
aunt
octavia
new
house
up
there
or
meddle
in
any
way
while
we
were
abroad
i
was
treated
as
a
little
girl
and
not
as
a
at
all
but
you
see
i
really
nineteen
and
some
of
cecilia
suitors
were
nice
to
me
when
we
were
traveling
they
were
nice
to
me
on
cecilia
account
you
know
of
course
you
so
hard
to
look
at
it
must
have
been
painful
to
them
to
be
nice
to
you
almost
like
taking
poison
go
on
hezekiah
you
need
interrupt
me
like
that
well
as
part
of
the
understanding
and
cecilia
agreed
to
it
she
thought
she
had
to
for
papa
sake
she
was
to
marry
a
particular
man
do
you
understand
me
a
particular
man
aunt
octavia
gave
her
the
little
she
bought
it
at
a
shop
in
paris
at
the
time
cecilia
consented
to
the
plan
and
she
was
to
keep
a
sort
of
diary
so
that
she
know
when
the
right
man
turned
up
now
we
will
drop
the
for
a
minute
only
i
say
that
cecilia
was
to
keep
the
book
all
to
herself
and
not
show
it
to
any
one
not
even
to
aunt
octavia
you
know
until
the
right
man
had
asked
cecilia
to
marry
him
now
who
do
you
suppose
ames
that
man
is
i
watched
her
hands
as
they
deftly
cut
and
fashioned
the
dry
reeds
the
air
grew
warm
as
the
sun
climbed
to
the
zenith
and
hezekiah
flung
aside
her
coat
the
breeze
caught
the
ends
of
her
tie
and
snapped
them
behind
her
she
was
wholly
absorbed
in
her
task
and
no
boy
could
have
managed
a
better
the
first
reed
she
made
a
trifle
longer
than
her
hand
the
succeeding
ones
she
trimmed
to
graduated
lessening
lengths
till
seven
in
all
had
been
cut
and
then
she
notched
them
seven
she
murmured
laying
them
neatly
in
order
on
her
knee
i
remember
the
right
number
by
a
poem
i
read
the
other
day
in
an
old
magazine
she
reached
down
and
plucked
several
long
leaves
of
tough
grass
with
which
she
began
to
bind
the
reeds
together
repeating
seven
gold
reeds
grew
tall
and
slim
close
by
the
river
beaded
brim
syrnix
the
naiad
flitted
past
pan
the
followed
fast
it
will
be
easier
said
hezekiah
if
you
hold
the
pipes
while
i
tie
them
i
found
this
propinquity
wholly
agreeable
it
was
pleasant
to
sit
on
a
log
beside
hezekiah
it
seemed
no
far
cry
to
the
storied
mediterranean
and
pan
and
dryads
and
naiads
as
hezekiah
bound
her
reeds
to
the
music
of
couplets
there
was
no
in
her
recitation
she
seemed
to
be
telling
me
of
something
that
she
had
seen
herself
an
hour
ago
he
spread
his
arms
to
clasp
her
there
just
as
she
vanished
into
air
and
to
his
bosom
warm
and
rough
drew
the
gold
reeds
close
enough
i
do
remember
the
rest
she
broke
off
but
there
that
a
pipe
fit
for
any
shepherd
she
put
it
to
her
lips
and
blew
i
shall
not
pretend
that
the
result
was
melodious
she
whistled
much
better
without
the
reeds
but
the
sight
of
her
sitting
on
the
fallen
tree
beside
the
lake
beating
time
with
her
foot
her
head
thrown
back
her
eyes
in
a
mockery
of
rapture
at
the
shrill
wheezy
uncertainties
and
ineptitudes
she
evoked
thrilled
me
with
new
and
wonderful
longings
a
heart
a
spirit
like
hers
would
never
grow
old
she
was
next
of
kin
to
all
the
elusive
fugitive
company
of
the
and
on
such
a
pipe
as
she
had
strung
together
beside
that
pond
to
this
day
sicilian
shepherd
boys
whistle
themselves
into
tune
with
theocritus
illustration
she
put
it
to
her
lips
and
blew
take
it
she
said
i
ca
tell
you
more
than
i
have
and
yet
it
is
all
there
chimneys
read
the
riddle
of
the
reeds
if
you
can
i
took
the
pipe
and
turned
it
over
carefully
in
my
hands
but
i
fear
my
thoughts
were
rather
of
the
hands
that
had
fashioned
it
the
fingers
that
had
danced
nimbly
upon
the
stops
there
are
seven
reeds
seven
she
affirmed
she
amused
herself
by
skipping
pebbles
over
the
surface
of
the
water
while
i
pondered
and
i
deliberated
long
for
one
did
not
like
to
blunder
before
hezekiah
then
i
jumped
up
and
called
to
her
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
not
until
the
seventh
man
offers
himself
shall
cecilia
have
a
husband
is
that
the
answer
for
a
moment
hezekiah
watched
the
widening
ripples
made
by
the
casting
of
her
last
pebble
then
she
came
back
and
resumed
her
seat
you
have
done
well
chimney
man
and
now
i
not
make
you
guess
any
more
though
i
found
it
all
out
for
myself
when
aunt
octavia
gave
that
to
cecilia
i
knew
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
the
seventh
man
you
know
i
love
all
aunt
octavia
nonsense
because
it
the
kind
of
foolishness
i
like
myself
and
the
idea
of
a
pretty
little
to
write
down
proposals
in
was
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
have
occurred
to
my
aunt
and
it
was
in
the
bargain
too
that
she
herself
should
not
in
any
way
interfere
or
try
to
influence
the
course
of
events
it
should
be
the
seventh
suitor
and
i
suspect
she
been
a
little
scared
too
she
has
indeed
she
was
almost
ready
to
throw
the
whole
scheme
over
last
night
your
naughtiness
had
got
on
her
nerves
you
missed
the
target
that
time
aunt
octavia
loves
my
naughtiness
and
i
think
she
has
really
been
afraid
sir
pumpkin
wiggins
would
catch
me
now
i
did
roam
my
aunt
house
just
for
fun
i
was
doing
my
best
to
keep
cecilia
from
getting
into
some
scrape
about
that
plan
i
found
out
by
chance
how
to
get
into
hopefield
and
about
the
hidden
stairway
and
the
old
rooms
tucked
away
there
papa
really
discovered
that
a
carpenter
in
katonah
who
worked
on
the
house
helped
to
build
papa
bungalow
and
he
told
us
how
that
ruin
came
to
be
there
that
man
who
also
immortalized
himself
by
inventing
the
ribless
umbrella
was
very
superstitious
he
believed
that
if
he
built
an
entirely
new
house
he
would
die
so
he
had
his
architect
build
around
and
retain
those
two
rooms
and
that
stairway
of
a
house
that
had
been
on
the
ground
almost
since
the
revolution
pepperton
the
architect
humored
him
but
hid
the
remains
of
the
relic
as
far
out
of
sight
as
possible
trust
pep
for
that
and
he
did
it
neatly
yes
but
it
did
save
the
he
died
anyhow
or
maybe
his
pies
killed
him
papa
was
so
curious
about
it
that
he
took
me
with
him
one
night
just
before
aunt
octavia
moved
here
and
he
and
i
found
the
rooms
and
the
stair
and
the
secret
spring
by
which
if
you
know
just
where
to
poke
the
wall
in
the
hall
you
can
disappear
as
mysteriously
as
you
please
but
how
on
earth
did
you
darken
the
halls
so
easily
you
nearly
gave
me
doing
that
oh
that
was
a
mere
matter
of
a
young
lady
in
haste
when
i
found
how
easily
i
could
pass
you
on
the
stair
it
became
a
fascinating
game
and
it
was
no
end
of
fun
to
see
just
how
long
it
would
take
you
to
catch
me
i
wish
hezekiah
that
you
would
stay
caught
be
very
very
careful
sir
we
talking
business
now
another
ordeal
for
you
before
you
dare
become
sentimental
then
hasten
let
us
be
after
it
things
are
in
a
serious
predicament
i
can
tell
you
i
was
frightened
when
i
looked
into
that
i
did
like
to
do
that
but
i
had
to
assist
providence
a
little
five
men
have
already
got
their
quietus
then
why
do
they
clear
out
and
stop
their
nonsense
oh
it
their
pride
i
suppose
and
every
man
probably
thinks
that
when
cecilia
has
seen
a
little
more
of
him
in
particular
in
contrast
with
the
others
he
will
win
her
favor
they
afraid
of
one
another
those
men
that
the
reason
they
been
herding
together
so
close
since
that
first
day
you
came
wiggins
was
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
was
the
whole
thing
just
like
the
man
and
those
others
forced
him
to
join
in
some
sort
of
arrangement
by
which
they
were
to
hang
together
these
calls
in
a
bunch
came
from
that
as
though
any
one
of
them
would
take
advantage
of
the
others
if
he
saw
a
chance
some
of
this
i
got
from
wiggy
himself
the
rest
i
just
guessed
but
you
may
not
know
that
they
sent
a
delegation
after
me
into
town
to
warn
me
off
the
grass
that
was
dick
he
never
saw
me
when
cecilia
was
around
and
he
was
terribly
snippy
sometimes
and
supercilious
but
i
going
to
get
even
with
him
i
about
underlined
him
for
number
six
she
concluded
with
the
manner
of
a
queen
who
about
to
give
her
chief
executioner
his
orders
for
the
day
glances
calmly
over
the
list
of
victims
that
a
good
idea
dick
is
insufferable
i
hope
you
have
counted
wrong
as
we
were
saying
about
the
she
resumed
the
fifth
man
has
already
been
respectfully
declined
the
dates
of
the
proposals
are
written
in
the
so
i
learned
from
the
book
that
ormsby
arbuthnot
and
gorse
had
proposed
on
the
steamer
professor
hume
as
you
know
tried
his
luck
at
hopefield
and
lord
arrowood
must
have
stopped
cecilia
as
she
was
riding
to
the
station
on
my
bicycle
yesterday
morning
his
goose
is
cooked
his
gooseberry
pie
was
cooked
but
i
took
it
away
from
him
no
pie
sacred
to
hezekiah
can
be
confiscated
by
an
indigent
lord
so
long
as
i
keep
my
present
health
and
spirits
it
the
close
season
for
lords
in
westchester
county
i
potted
the
last
one
by
the
way
he
thought
you
were
a
real
ghost
when
you
were
playing
tag
with
him
in
the
dark
he
stopped
to
tell
papa
and
spoke
very
highly
of
you
papa
and
you
are
the
only
gentlemen
he
met
in
america
but
now
we
come
to
mr
wiggins
we
do
and
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
beautiful
and
good
has
he
tried
his
luck
because
knowing
cecilia
admiration
for
him
replied
hezekiah
demurely
i
have
kept
him
so
diverted
that
he
has
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
the
scratch
she
examined
the
palm
of
her
hand
critically
to
allow
me
time
to
grasp
this
you
did
want
him
to
blunder
in
as
the
first
fourth
or
sixth
man
hezekiah
gravely
nodded
her
pretty
head
and
while
you
were
engaged
in
this
sisterly
labor
cecilia
has
been
afraid
that
you
were
seriously
interested
in
him
that
is
like
cecilia
she
fine
and
would
cause
me
trouble
for
anything
and
there
was
no
doubt
of
hezekiah
sincerity
but
now
that
i
see
the
light
and
understand
all
this
how
can
we
make
sure
that
wiggy
will
be
on
the
spot
at
the
right
moment
while
we
sit
here
he
may
be
the
sixth
man
there
my
friend
the
eminent
thinker
from
nebraska
he
likely
to
kneel
before
cecilia
at
any
moment
and
henderson
and
shallenberger
are
not
asleep
that
all
true
and
you
got
to
fix
it
you
leaving
the
fate
of
wiggins
and
your
sister
in
my
hands
that
a
heavy
responsibility
hezekiah
i
might
take
care
of
wiggy
by
asking
cecilia
to
marry
me
being
careful
to
have
him
appear
when
i
had
been
duly
declined
um
i
should
take
any
chances
if
i
were
you
she
replied
feigning
to
look
at
an
imaginary
bird
in
a
for
if
you
had
counted
wrong
and
were
really
the
seventh
man
she
would
have
to
accept
you
hezekiah
oh
i
really
did
mean
what
you
thought
i
meant
we
do
need
to
discuss
it
any
more
that
the
ordeal
i
arranged
for
you
she
answered
and
set
her
lips
sternly
but
my
dear
hezekiah
by
what
means
can
this
be
effected
i
dare
tell
him
the
combination
he
playing
against
or
sit
on
him
until
his
hour
strikes
certainly
not
you
must
tell
him
or
anybody
else
you
know
the
plan
but
you
not
supposed
to
and
nobody
must
know
i
meddled
meanwhile
cecilia
must
expose
herself
to
proposals
at
all
times
aunt
octavia
heart
would
be
broken
if
she
thought
providence
had
been
tampered
with
she
likes
wiggy
well
enough
except
that
his
ancestors
were
all
tories
and
he
ca
be
a
son
of
the
revolution
too
bad
it
was
very
careless
of
him
not
to
do
better
about
his
ancestors
but
he
ca
change
that
now
well
you
behaved
with
considerable
intelligence
so
far
and
now
with
your
friend
fate
in
your
hands
you
will
need
to
use
great
judgment
and
tact
in
all
that
follows
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
business
she
rose
quickly
and
pointed
to
her
coat
drop
it
into
the
boat
for
me
chimneys
we
meet
in
funny
places
do
we
papa
expects
me
for
luncheon
and
i
must
row
back
and
get
my
bicycle
you
no
you
ca
go
along
you
got
a
lot
of
thinking
to
do
and
you
better
be
doing
it
xviii
trouble
at
the
prescott
arms
a
few
minutes
later
as
i
swung
along
the
highway
toward
the
prescott
arms
i
saw
cecilia
hollister
riding
toward
me
at
a
lively
gallop
she
crossed
the
bridge
without
checking
her
horse
and
then
with
a
hurried
glance
over
her
shoulder
she
pointed
with
her
crop
to
a
that
led
deviously
into
a
strip
of
forest
and
vanished
i
hurried
after
her
and
found
her
waiting
for
me
in
a
quiet
lane
she
had
dismounted
and
seemed
greatly
disturbed
as
i
addressed
her
her
horse
a
superb
estabrook
thoroughbred
had
evidently
been
pushed
hard
cecilia
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
was
giving
a
touch
to
the
wayward
strands
of
hair
that
had
been
shaken
loose
in
her
flight
the
color
glowed
in
her
dark
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
excitement
i
had
expected
to
meet
you
i
thought
you
rode
off
with
your
aunt
toward
mt
kisco
we
did
but
on
our
way
home
aunt
octavia
stopped
to
call
on
a
friend
and
as
i
did
feel
in
a
mood
for
visits
this
morning
i
rode
on
alone
she
spoke
further
of
her
aunt
friend
of
whom
i
had
never
heard
before
to
calm
herself
before
touching
upon
the
cause
of
her
wild
ride
or
her
wish
to
speak
to
me
she
pinned
on
her
hat
and
drew
on
her
while
i
helped
to
make
conversation
and
soon
regained
her
composure
the
haste
with
which
she
had
withdrawn
into
the
wood
and
the
imperative
wave
of
her
crop
by
which
she
had
bidden
me
follow
her
indicated
that
something
of
importance
had
happened
and
that
she
wished
to
confide
in
me
i
was
walking
my
horse
in
the
road
beyond
bedford
just
after
i
left
aunt
octavia
when
who
should
ride
up
beside
me
but
wiggins
he
had
evidently
been
following
me
she
expected
me
to
express
surprise
and
with
the
information
that
hezekiah
had
just
imparted
fresh
in
my
mind
i
dare
say
she
was
not
disappointed
in
the
effect
of
her
words
i
was
thinking
rapidly
and
fearfully
if
my
friend
had
sought
her
in
the
highway
and
offered
himself
in
some
fresh
accession
of
ardor
he
might
even
now
be
a
rejected
and
hopeless
man
but
i
was
unwilling
to
believe
that
this
had
happened
hartley
is
fond
of
riding
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
for
him
to
have
his
horse
sent
out
from
town
oh
it
natural
enough
she
cried
but
i
was
greatly
taken
aback
when
he
rode
up
beside
me
an
old
friend
joining
you
in
the
highway
on
a
bright
october
morning
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
anything
surprising
or
alarming
in
that
miss
hollister
but
only
yesterday
you
remember
i
told
you
i
had
seen
him
walking
with
my
sister
it
perfectly
easy
to
talk
to
hezekiah
it
seems
to
me
that
that
only
shows
a
friendly
attitude
toward
all
the
family
let
us
deal
with
facts
if
i
am
to
help
you
i
understand
perfectly
that
hartley
wiggins
wishes
to
marry
you
and
that
being
the
case
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
be
courteous
to
your
sister
i
always
heard
that
the
proper
thing
to
be
polite
to
the
sisters
cousins
and
aunts
of
one
prospective
wife
i
know
of
no
more
delightful
occupation
than
listening
to
hezekiah
just
now
for
an
hour
or
so
i
have
been
enjoying
her
conversation
myself
nothing
could
be
more
refreshing
or
stimulating
she
is
an
unusual
young
woman
and
most
amazingly
wise
you
have
seen
hezekiah
this
morning
she
exclaimed
i
have
indeed
i
hope
i
may
say
that
she
and
i
are
becoming
good
friends
i
am
learning
to
understand
her
though
believe
me
i
speak
boastingly
however
this
morning
we
got
on
famously
together
but
wo
you
continue
and
tell
me
what
happened
in
the
road
when
hartley
rode
up
beside
you
oh
nothing
happened
really
nothing
nothing
could
have
happened
for
the
excellent
reason
that
i
ran
away
from
him
it
was
what
he
did
or
said
it
was
the
fear
of
what
he
might
say
if
it
had
been
dick
who
had
joined
you
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
the
highway
you
would
not
have
minded
in
the
least
miss
hollister
is
that
the
truth
her
hand
that
had
rested
on
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
dropped
to
her
side
and
she
stood
erect
her
eyes
wide
with
wonder
what
do
you
mean
she
gasped
i
mean
exactly
what
i
have
said
that
if
it
had
been
that
strutting
young
philosopher
from
the
west
you
would
well
you
would
have
allowed
him
to
say
what
was
in
his
mind
no
matter
whether
it
had
been
his
latest
thought
on
kantianism
the
weather
or
his
admiration
for
yourself
am
i
not
right
i
wonder
i
wonder
she
faltered
drawing
away
the
better
to
observe
me
you
wonder
how
much
i
know
to
relieve
your
mind
without
parleying
further
i
will
say
to
you
that
i
know
everything
then
aunt
octavia
must
have
told
you
and
that
seems
incredible
it
was
distinctly
understood
your
aunt
told
me
nothing
not
by
words
did
any
one
tell
me
not
by
words
she
asked
eyeing
me
wonderingly
and
clearly
fearing
that
i
might
be
playing
some
trick
upon
her
then
can
it
be
that
hezekiah
but
no
hezekiah
does
know
trust
hezekiah
for
not
telling
secrets
i
answered
evasively
give
me
credit
for
some
imagination
the
air
of
hopefield
is
stimulating
and
in
the
few
days
i
have
spent
in
your
aunt
house
i
have
learned
much
that
i
never
dreamed
of
before
i
am
not
at
all
the
person
you
greeted
with
so
much
courtesy
in
the
library
when
i
arrived
there
a
and
an
ignorant
person
a
few
afternoons
ago
called
as
i
thought
to
prescribe
for
flues
that
proved
to
be
in
admirable
condition
but
really
summoned
by
higher
powers
to
assist
the
fates
in
the
proper
and
orderly
performance
of
their
duties
to
several
members
of
the
house
of
hollister
yourself
among
them
i
do
understand
it
you
are
wholly
inexplicable
i
am
the
simplest
and
least
guileful
of
beings
i
assure
you
yet
i
have
done
some
things
here
not
in
the
slightest
way
related
to
chimney
doctoring
and
something
else
i
expect
to
do
for
which
i
believe
you
will
thank
me
through
all
the
years
of
your
life
ah
if
you
really
know
that
is
possible
she
sighed
wearily
i
am
very
tired
of
it
all
i
was
very
foolish
ever
to
have
agreed
to
aunt
octavia
plan
you
have
seen
those
men
any
one
of
them
might
you
know
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
any
one
of
them
might
be
the
seventh
man
there
you
see
i
do
know
and
i
mean
to
help
you
she
was
immensely
relieved
there
was
no
question
of
that
gratitude
shone
in
her
eyes
and
then
as
i
marvelled
at
their
beautiful
dark
depths
fear
suddenly
possessed
them
the
change
in
her
was
startling
several
motors
had
swept
by
in
the
outer
road
while
we
talked
they
were
faintly
visible
through
the
trees
and
just
now
we
both
heard
a
horse
and
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
hartley
wiggins
riding
slowly
with
bowed
head
toward
the
inn
cecilia
horse
flung
up
his
head
but
she
clapped
her
hands
upon
his
nostrils
and
held
them
there
to
prevent
his
whinnying
until
that
figure
of
despair
had
passed
out
of
hearing
i
was
smitten
with
sorrow
for
hartley
wiggins
i
could
put
myself
in
his
place
and
imagine
his
feelings
as
he
rode
like
a
defeated
general
back
to
the
inn
there
to
face
the
other
suitors
after
the
humiliating
experience
which
cecilia
hollister
had
just
described
in
his
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
her
eagerness
to
escape
from
him
he
no
doubt
believed
that
he
had
all
unconsciously
made
himself
intolerable
to
her
it
was
plain
that
that
glimpse
of
him
had
touched
cecilia
pity
if
i
had
doubted
the
sincerity
of
her
regard
for
him
before
i
spurned
the
thought
now
i
was
anxious
to
requicken
hope
in
her
an
odd
office
for
me
to
assume
when
in
my
own
affairs
i
had
always
yielded
my
sword
readily
to
the
blue
devils
yet
during
my
short
stay
at
hopefield
i
had
already
found
it
possible
to
restore
miss
octavia
confidence
in
her
own
chosen
destiny
and
in
this
delicate
between
cecilia
hollister
and
my
best
friend
i
proffered
counsel
and
sympathy
with
an
assurance
that
astonished
me
i
have
told
you
enough
miss
hollister
to
make
it
clear
that
i
am
in
a
position
to
help
you
believe
me
i
have
no
other
business
before
me
but
to
complete
the
service
i
have
undertaken
but
there
is
always
she
began
then
ceased
abruptly
and
lifted
her
head
proudly
there
is
always
wiggins
attitude
toward
my
sister
not
for
anything
in
the
world
would
i
cause
her
the
slightest
unhappiness
you
must
see
that
now
that
you
know
her
i
laughed
aloud
cecilia
concern
for
hezekiah
happiness
was
so
absurd
that
i
could
not
restrain
my
mirth
for
a
moment
displeasure
showed
promptly
in
cecilia
face
i
am
sorry
if
you
doubt
my
sincerity
ames
i
will
put
the
matter
directly
to
make
sure
i
have
not
been
misunderstood
heretofore
and
say
that
if
hezekiah
is
interested
in
hartley
wiggins
and
cares
for
him
in
the
least
you
know
she
is
young
and
susceptible
i
shall
take
care
that
he
never
sees
me
again
pardon
me
but
maybe
you
do
quite
understand
hezekiah
is
it
possible
then
that
you
do
she
inquired
coldly
i
imagine
your
opportunities
for
seeing
her
have
not
been
numerous
well
it
is
so
much
a
matter
of
seeing
her
when
you
read
of
her
all
your
life
and
dreamed
about
her
she
in
every
fairy
story
that
ever
was
written
she
dances
through
the
mythologies
of
all
races
hers
is
the
kingdom
of
the
pure
in
heart
her
mind
is
like
a
beautiful
bright
meadow
by
the
sea
and
her
thoughts
the
dipping
of
on
lightly
swaying
grasses
cecilia
manner
changed
and
she
smiled
you
seem
to
have
an
attack
of
something
it
looks
serious
you
have
known
her
long
enough
to
find
out
so
much
longer
than
you
would
believe
she
and
i
sat
on
the
shore
together
when
ulysses
sailed
by
we
were
among
those
present
at
the
sack
of
troy
we
heard
roland
ivory
trumpet
at
roncesvalles
such
words
from
you
amaze
me
i
did
imagine
there
was
so
much
romance
in
chimneys
they
are
full
of
it
commend
me
to
an
open
fire
with
a
flue
that
knows
its
business
and
a
dream
or
two
i
renounced
my
profession
i
shall
hereafter
offer
myself
as
adviser
to
persons
in
need
of
illusions
we
all
be
poets
if
we
dared
i
helped
her
into
the
saddle
and
she
looked
down
at
me
with
amusement
in
her
eyes
my
praise
of
hezekiah
had
pleased
her
and
i
felt
as
when
we
journeyed
together
into
town
her
kindly
human
qualities
the
perplexities
and
embarrassments
resulting
from
her
compact
with
her
aunt
had
doubtless
checked
the
natural
flow
of
her
spirits
she
talked
on
buoyantly
though
i
was
eager
to
be
off
to
avert
the
catastrophe
that
only
her
flight
had
prevented
and
which
wiggins
might
at
any
moment
precipitate
she
gathered
up
her
reins
you
are
not
coming
home
for
luncheon
then
i
shall
see
you
at
four
i
hope
the
of
the
ghost
will
prove
interesting
aunt
octavia
has
built
her
hopes
high
and
i
may
add
that
she
has
expressed
the
greatest
admiration
of
you
to
me
on
her
ride
this
morning
she
declared
that
great
things
are
in
store
for
you
i
hope
so
too
mr
ames
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
rode
away
and
before
i
had
reached
the
highway
she
was
across
the
bridge
and
galloping
rapidly
homeward
the
inn
was
a
mile
distant
and
i
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
turning
over
in
my
mind
various
projects
for
controlling
the
characters
now
upon
the
stage
in
such
manner
that
wiggins
should
become
the
seventh
man
cecilia
could
not
always
run
away
from
him
without
violating
the
terms
of
her
aunt
stipulation
and
it
was
unlikely
that
she
would
attempt
further
to
guide
or
thwart
the
pointing
finger
of
fate
i
relied
little
upon
any
arrangement
effected
among
the
suitors
to
stand
together
hume
had
already
found
a
chance
to
speak
lord
arrowood
had
bitten
the
dust
and
turned
his
face
homeward
and
wiggins
had
been
near
the
brink
only
that
morning
it
was
unlikely
that
any
of
the
active
candidates
remaining
would
stumble
upon
the
key
to
the
situation
which
hezekiah
had
given
into
my
keeping
it
was
well
on
toward
two
when
i
approached
the
inn
before
long
the
suitors
would
depart
for
their
afternoon
call
at
the
manor
which
was
an
established
event
of
the
day
just
as
i
was
about
to
enter
the
gate
i
was
arrested
by
an
imperious
voice
calling
and
john
stewart
dick
came
running
toward
me
he
had
evidently
been
expecting
me
and
i
paused
thinking
him
about
to
renew
his
attack
upon
me
to
my
surprise
he
greeted
me
cordially
even
offering
his
hand
you
thought
you
would
come
after
all
well
i
glad
you
did
decided
that
there
should
be
peace
between
us
in
stature
he
was
the
shortest
of
the
suitors
but
what
he
lacked
in
height
was
compensated
for
by
a
tremendous
dignity
a
dark
napoleonic
lock
lay
across
his
forehead
and
his
profile
otherwise
suggested
the
corsican
the
resemblance
being
i
wickedly
assumed
one
that
the
philosopher
encouraged
you
have
several
times
addressed
me
ames
in
a
spirit
of
contumely
which
i
have
hesitated
to
punish
by
the
chastisement
you
deserve
but
i
am
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
his
changed
tone
put
me
on
guard
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
take
him
seriously
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
vigorous
muscular
young
fellow
who
could
have
threshed
me
without
trouble
i
could
not
resist
the
impulse
he
always
roused
in
me
to
address
him
in
language
any
man
would
resent
chant
the
with
considerable
plato
for
i
am
hungry
and
would
fain
pay
for
food
at
the
adjacent
inn
i
will
overlook
the
coarseness
of
your
humor
he
rejoined
haughtily
my
own
time
is
as
valuable
as
yours
you
have
sneered
at
my
attainments
as
a
philosopher
but
i
will
pass
that
for
the
present
i
am
disposed
to
treat
you
magnanimously
you
have
an
excellent
opinion
of
yourself
you
have
come
here
as
an
intruder
upon
the
rights
of
those
of
us
who
followed
cecilia
hollister
across
europe
and
home
to
america
but
in
spite
of
this
i
waive
my
rights
in
your
favor
i
had
intended
to
offer
myself
to
miss
hollister
this
afternoon
with
every
hope
of
success
but
i
yield
to
you
my
only
request
is
that
you
inform
me
at
once
when
you
have
learned
her
decision
he
clapped
on
his
cap
and
folded
his
arms
clearly
satisfied
with
the
expressions
of
surprise
to
which
my
feelings
betrayed
me
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
guessed
the
truth
perhaps
by
deductive
processes
of
which
i
was
ignorant
whether
he
had
reasoned
from
some
remark
thrown
out
by
miss
octavia
as
to
the
influence
of
seven
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
her
application
of
that
fateful
principle
to
the
choice
of
a
husband
for
cecilia
i
could
not
guess
but
assuming
that
he
had
caught
that
clue
he
might
readily
enough
have
managed
the
rest
having
crossed
on
the
steamer
with
the
suitor
host
a
man
of
his
intelligence
might
readily
enough
have
kept
track
of
the
vanquished
in
any
case
he
had
hit
upon
me
as
a
likely
victim
and
on
the
plea
of
generously
waiting
till
i
had
tried
my
luck
he
hoped
to
thrust
me
forward
as
the
sixth
suitor
and
immediately
thereafter
project
himself
as
the
inevitable
seventh
man
the
whole
situation
was
rendered
perilously
complex
by
the
knowledge
that
unaided
he
had
possessed
himself
of
so
much
dangerous
information
i
must
not
however
allow
him
to
see
what
i
suspected
my
dear
professor
there
an
ancient
warning
against
the
greeks
bearing
gifts
you
must
give
me
time
to
inspect
the
horse
are
you
questioning
my
good
faith
be
it
far
from
me
i
a
good
deal
tickled
though
by
your
genial
assumption
that
if
i
offered
myself
to
this
lady
i
should
be
declined
with
thanks
you
have
fretted
yourself
into
a
state
of
mind
that
bodes
ill
for
american
philosophy
he
was
again
belligerent
it
may
have
occurred
to
him
that
i
might
know
as
much
as
he
but
at
any
rate
he
grinned
it
was
a
saturnine
grin
i
did
not
like
i
starving
to
death
at
the
door
of
an
inn
and
you
must
excuse
me
have
you
seen
hartley
wiggins
lately
i
have
indeed
he
taken
to
lonely
horseback
rides
he
off
somewhere
now
he
has
the
stamina
for
a
contest
like
this
one
by
one
the
autumn
leaves
are
falling
he
added
with
special
intention
and
i
have
given
you
your
chance
thanks
socrates
from
the
lands
of
the
ogalallas
for
so
much
courtesy
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
reading
all
your
posthumous
works
let
us
cease
being
absurd
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
lowered
his
tone
do
be
an
ass
if
you
and
i
both
know
what
underneath
all
this
mystery
we
might
come
to
an
understanding
i
do
follow
you
please
make
a
light
like
a
man
about
to
have
an
idea
you
mean
that
you
do
understand
he
eyed
me
doubtfully
uncertain
whether
i
knew
or
not
you
have
implied
that
i
am
incapable
of
understanding
suppose
we
let
it
go
at
that
with
this
i
left
him
and
entered
the
office
it
was
really
a
pleasant
unspoiled
by
the
usual
paraphernalia
dick
had
followed
close
behind
and
as
i
paused
hearing
voices
raised
angrily
in
the
beyond
i
turned
to
him
for
an
explanation
as
the
suitors
had
been
the
only
guests
of
the
inn
since
their
advent
having
stipulated
that
the
proprietor
should
exclude
other
applicants
for
meals
or
lodging
i
attributed
the
commotion
to
strife
in
their
own
ranks
dick
nodded
sullenly
and
bade
me
keep
on
you
better
take
a
look
at
those
fellows
i
quit
them
quite
out
of
it
remember
that
the
door
was
slightly
ajar
and
i
flung
it
open
ormsby
shallenberger
henderson
hume
gorse
and
arbuthnot
had
been
engaged
with
cards
at
a
round
table
in
an
alcove
but
some
dispute
having
apparently
risen
they
stood
in
their
places
engaged
in
acrimonious
debate
as
near
as
i
could
determine
some
one
of
them
i
think
it
was
ormsby
wished
to
abandon
the
game
which
had
been
undertaken
to
determine
in
what
order
they
should
be
permitted
to
pay
visits
to
hopefield
in
future
the
calls
having
grown
intolerable
they
were
so
absorbed
in
their
argument
that
they
failed
to
note
my
appearance
and
i
stood
unobserved
within
the
door
the
dialogue
between
the
was
swift
and
hot
it
no
good
i
tell
you
cried
ormsby
there
no
fairness
in
this
unless
all
take
their
chances
together
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
before
we
began
this
was
your
scheme
but
because
the
cards
are
running
against
you
you
want
to
quit
i
say
we
go
on
this
from
henderson
who
struck
the
table
sharply
as
he
concluded
you
knew
wiggins
and
dick
were
going
in
when
we
started
and
you
are
not
likely
to
get
them
in
now
your
anxiety
to
cut
the
rest
of
us
out
by
any
means
seems
to
have
unsettled
your
mind
shouted
gorse
i
say
let
drop
this
and
stand
to
our
original
agreement
that
no
man
speak
till
the
end
of
the
fortnight
after
that
whole
scheme
has
been
torn
to
pieces
like
paper
been
nothing
fair
in
this
business
from
the
start
we
ought
to
have
kept
arrowood
here
and
held
together
and
we
ought
to
have
got
rid
of
that
ames
fellow
he
did
belong
in
this
at
all
and
instead
of
protecting
ourselves
against
outsiders
we
have
sat
here
like
a
lot
of
fools
while
he
been
making
himself
agreeable
there
in
the
house
right
there
in
the
house
ormsby
voice
rose
to
a
disagreeable
squeak
as
he
closed
with
this
indictment
of
me
hume
fidgeted
uneasily
and
met
my
eye
so
warily
that
i
wondered
whether
he
suspected
that
i
knew
of
his
breach
of
faith
with
the
other
suitors
much
dallying
with
scandinavian
literature
had
not
lightened
his
heart
and
there
was
nothing
in
ibsen
to
which
he
could
refer
his
present
plight
shallenberger
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
of
the
group
who
had
not
lost
his
senses
he
was
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
alcove
out
of
sight
from
the
door
but
i
heard
him
distinctly
as
he
addressed
the
other
suitors
with
rising
anger
we
acting
like
cads
and
cads
of
the
most
contemptible
sort
i
only
agreed
to
this
game
to
satisfy
ormsby
the
idea
of
our
sitting
here
to
draw
cards
to
determine
the
order
in
which
we
shall
offer
ourselves
to
the
noblest
and
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
would
be
coarse
and
vulgar
if
it
were
not
so
ridiculous
the
men
who
had
their
chance
on
the
steamer
or
after
we
came
here
and
i
do
pretend
to
know
who
they
are
ought
in
decency
to
have
left
the
field
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
we
pretend
to
be
gentlemen
or
far
less
pardonable
that
we
pay
court
to
a
lady
damn
you
all
i
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
you
and
if
you
try
to
interfere
with
my
affairs
in
any
way
i
smash
your
heads
collectively
or
separately
as
you
prefer
my
interest
in
this
colloquy
had
led
me
further
into
the
room
and
hearing
my
step
they
all
turned
and
faced
me
dick
had
continued
at
my
side
but
the
black
looks
they
sent
our
way
were
intended
i
thought
rather
for
me
shallenberger
having
taken
himself
out
of
the
tangle
leaned
against
the
wall
and
filled
his
pipe
with
unconcern
my
appearance
roused
ormsby
to
a
fresh
outburst
you
responsible
if
you
had
forced
yourself
upon
the
ladies
at
hopefield
there
would
have
been
any
of
this
trouble
you
only
an
impostor
anyhow
you
went
to
the
house
to
fix
a
chimney
and
seem
to
think
you
engaged
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
there
protested
henderson
twisting
the
ends
of
his
moustache
then
they
dropped
me
and
assailed
dick
we
like
to
know
what
you
expect
to
gain
by
dropping
out
you
got
cold
feet
mighty
sudden
bellowed
ormsby
gorse
and
henderson
paid
similar
tributes
to
the
apostate
whose
melancholy
grin
only
deepened
shallenberger
was
pacing
the
floor
slowly
and
puffing
his
pipe
hume
and
arbuthnot
growled
occasionally
but
shared
i
thought
shallenberger
changed
feeling
my
silence
had
been
effective
up
to
this
time
but
i
was
afraid
to
risk
it
longer
dick
i
imagined
had
kept
close
to
me
for
fear
of
missing
any
part
of
the
altercation
he
knew
my
appearance
would
provoke
the
more
vociferous
suitors
had
howled
themselves
hoarse
and
glared
at
me
while
i
considered
the
situation
henderson
rallied
for
a
final
shot
a
good
horsewhipping
is
what
you
deserve
he
cried
leveling
his
finger
at
me
gentlemen
i
began
not
without
inward
quaking
you
have
spoken
loud
naughty
words
to
me
and
in
reply
i
must
say
that
your
vocal
efforts
suggest
only
the
melodies
of
the
braying
jackass
and
that
your
manners
to
speak
mildly
are
susceptible
of
considerable
improvement
you
leave
this
neighborhood
within
an
hour
boomed
ormsby
and
in
his
efforts
to
free
himself
from
his
chair
it
fell
backward
with
a
crash
that
echoed
through
the
long
room
then
summon
the
coroner
by
telephone
for
i
shall
not
be
taken
alive
i
answered
quietly
trying
to
recall
my
youthful
delight
in
porthos
athos
and
aramis
i
should
dislike
to
change
the
mild
of
this
pleasant
but
as
sure
as
you
lay
hands
on
me
these
walls
will
become
a
playground
for
any
corpuscles
you
carry
in
your
loathsome
persons
come
along
let
us
put
him
out
henderson
was
saying
in
an
aside
to
ormsby
you
were
playing
a
game
here
for
a
stake
not
yours
for
the
winning
i
continued
now
i
suggest
that
you
shuffle
the
pack
you
three
who
are
so
full
of
valor
shuffle
the
pack
i
say
and
draw
for
the
jack
of
clubs
whoever
is
the
fortunate
man
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
pitching
through
yonder
very
charming
casement
agreed
cried
henderson
and
the
three
flung
themselves
into
their
chairs
the
alacrity
of
their
consent
had
unnerved
me
for
a
moment
i
was
sure
would
have
fought
them
all
but
i
consoled
myself
as
the
cards
rattled
on
the
bare
table
with
the
reflection
that
considering
the
fact
that
i
had
never
in
my
life
laid
violent
hands
on
a
i
was
conducting
myself
with
admirable
assurance
my
weight
has
always
hung
well
within
one
hundred
and
thirty
and
physicians
have
told
me
that
i
was
incapable
of
taking
on
flesh
or
muscle
any
one
of
these
men
could
easily
toss
me
through
the
window
i
had
indicated
as
a
means
of
their
own
exit
shallenberger
caught
my
eye
and
indicated
with
a
slight
jerk
of
the
head
that
i
had
better
run
before
it
was
too
late
the
painstaking
care
with
which
henderson
had
fallen
upon
the
cards
was
disquieting
to
put
it
mildly
dick
nudged
me
in
the
ribs
and
offered
to
hold
my
coat
it
will
not
be
necessary
i
replied
carelessly
tender
your
services
to
the
other
gentlemen
i
felt
the
cold
sweat
gathering
on
my
brow
the
three
had
begun
to
draw
cards
and
i
heard
them
slap
the
bits
of
pasteboard
smartly
upon
the
table
as
they
lifted
them
from
the
deck
and
finding
the
jack
of
clubs
still
undrawn
waited
the
next
turn
i
had
no
idea
that
a
pack
of
cards
would
dissolve
so
readily
by
the
drawing
process
and
my
memory
ceased
trying
to
recall
the
adventures
of
and
hovered
with
ominous
persistence
about
the
mad
don
of
la
mancha
i
can
not
say
now
whether
i
stood
my
ground
out
of
sheer
physical
inability
to
run
or
from
an
accession
of
courage
due
to
the
remembrance
of
my
success
in
detecting
the
hopefield
ghost
in
any
case
i
affected
coolness
as
i
waited
even
throwing
out
my
arms
to
shoot
my
cuffs
once
or
twice
and
yawning
come
gentlemen
hurry
let
us
not
waste
time
here
i
exclaimed
impatiently
if
ormsby
turns
up
the
card
you
a
dead
man
dick
was
muttering
gloomily
they
all
alike
to
me
i
replied
loudly
ormsby
is
very
beautiful
i
shall
hope
not
to
disfigure
him
permanently
but
as
i
spoke
my
tongue
was
a
wobbly
dry
clapper
in
my
mouth
i
was
bending
over
now
watching
the
three
men
pick
up
the
cards
and
once
when
i
misread
the
jack
of
spades
for
the
jack
of
clubs
a
shudder
passed
over
me
they
were
down
to
the
last
card
and
hand
was
on
it
i
recall
that
a
group
of
steins
on
a
shelf
over
henderson
head
seemed
to
be
dancing
wildly
then
i
looked
at
the
floor
to
steady
myself
and
hope
leaped
within
me
for
there
by
ormsby
foot
a
large
and
heavy
one
lay
an
upturned
card
the
jack
of
clubs
whose
lone
symbol
magnified
itself
enormously
in
my
amazed
eyes
at
this
moment
i
became
conscious
that
something
had
occurred
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
other
men
who
were
staring
at
some
one
who
had
entered
noiselessly
gentlemen
you
seem
immensely
interested
in
the
turn
of
those
cards
i
am
glad
to
have
arrived
at
the
critical
moment
ormsby
will
you
kindly
lift
the
remaining
card
from
the
table
miss
octavia
stood
beside
me
she
was
dressed
in
a
dark
brown
the
feather
in
her
fedora
hat
emphasized
her
usual
brisk
air
she
swung
her
lightly
in
her
hand
and
bent
over
the
table
with
the
deepest
interest
ormsby
turned
up
the
card
it
was
the
ten
of
diamonds
gentlemen
i
cried
pointing
to
the
card
what
trick
is
this
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
been
trifling
with
me
in
a
fashion
for
which
men
have
died
the
world
over
by
sword
and
pistol
kindly
explain
arnold
the
nature
of
this
difficulty
miss
octavia
commanded
simply
this
miss
hollister
if
i
must
answer
i
had
offered
to
fight
these
three
gentlemen
in
order
it
was
agreed
that
the
man
who
drew
the
jack
of
clubs
from
the
pack
with
which
they
had
been
playing
should
be
my
first
victim
they
have
shuffled
their
own
cards
and
have
drawn
the
whole
pack
and
there
is
no
jack
of
clubs
in
the
pack
the
only
possible
explanation
is
one
to
which
i
hesitate
to
apply
the
obvious
plain
saxon
terms
it
dropped
out
that
all
you
do
dare
pretend
that
we
threw
out
the
jack
to
avoid
drawing
it
protested
ormsby
though
i
saw
from
the
glances
the
trio
exchanged
that
they
suspected
one
another
ormsby
and
gorse
bent
down
to
look
for
the
missing
card
but
before
they
found
it
i
stepped
forward
and
drove
my
fist
upon
the
table
with
all
the
power
i
could
put
into
the
blow
stop
i
cried
i
gave
you
every
opportunity
to
stand
up
and
take
a
trouncing
but
i
need
hardly
say
that
after
this
contemptible
knavery
i
refuse
to
soil
my
hands
on
you
do
you
insinuate
began
henderson
jumping
to
his
feet
gentlemen
said
miss
hollister
lifting
the
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
me
that
ames
has
gone
as
far
as
any
gentleman
need
go
in
protecting
his
honor
i
do
not
offer
myself
as
an
arbitrator
here
but
i
advise
my
young
friend
that
nothing
further
is
required
of
him
in
this
deplorable
affair
with
one
sweep
of
her
crop
she
brushed
to
the
floor
the
three
piles
of
cards
that
lay
on
the
table
as
they
had
been
stacked
when
drawn
illustration
with
one
sweep
of
her
crop
she
brushed
to
the
floor
the
three
piles
of
cards
arnold
she
said
with
indescribable
dignity
will
you
kindly
attend
me
to
my
horse
xix
the
ghost
of
adoniram
caldwell
a
held
miss
octavia
horse
at
the
her
face
her
figure
her
voice
expressed
outraged
dignity
as
she
tested
the
you
need
never
tell
me
what
had
happened
to
provoke
your
wrath
for
that
is
none
of
my
affair
but
i
wish
to
say
that
your
conduct
and
bearing
won
my
highest
approval
they
had
undoubtedly
hidden
the
jack
of
clubs
to
avoid
the
drubbing
you
would
have
administered
to
the
unfortunate
man
who
would
have
drawn
that
card
if
it
had
been
in
the
pack
i
was
not
in
the
slightest
danger
at
any
time
miss
hollister
i
protested
by
one
of
those
tricks
of
fate
to
which
you
and
i
are
becoming
so
accustomed
the
card
had
fallen
to
the
floor
unnoticed
if
you
had
not
arrived
so
opportunely
the
lost
jack
would
have
been
discovered
the
cards
reshuffled
and
very
likely
ormsby
would
have
been
dusting
the
with
me
at
this
very
minute
i
refuse
to
believe
any
such
thing
declared
miss
octavia
who
had
mounted
and
continued
speaking
from
the
saddle
your
perfect
confidence
was
admirable
and
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
terrible
punishment
you
would
have
given
them
i
do
not
particularly
dislike
ormsby
though
the
possibility
of
cecilia
marrying
him
has
troubled
me
not
a
little
as
i
have
recalled
the
unromantic
aspect
of
utica
as
seen
from
the
but
it
is
much
to
your
credit
that
you
defied
them
all
and
brought
them
to
the
and
then
by
a
stroke
of
cleverness
it
pleased
me
to
witness
placed
them
irretrievably
in
the
wrong
if
miss
octavia
wished
to
view
my
performances
in
this
flattering
light
it
seemed
unnecessary
and
unkind
to
object
now
that
i
was
in
the
open
again
with
a
whole
skin
i
was
not
averse
to
the
victor
crown
i
would
even
wear
it
tilted
slightly
over
one
ear
birds
have
been
killed
by
shots
that
missed
the
real
target
bunker
sands
are
rich
in
gutta
percha
and
good
intentions
i
was
a
fraud
but
a
cheerful
one
it
was
only
a
pleasant
incident
of
the
day
work
miss
hollister
i
going
to
engage
a
squire
and
take
to
the
open
road
as
soon
as
all
this
is
over
as
soon
as
all
what
is
over
she
demanded
eyeing
me
keenly
oh
the
work
i
undertaken
to
do
here
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
made
some
progress
but
within
hours
i
dare
say
that
we
shall
have
seen
the
end
your
words
are
not
wholly
luminous
arnold
it
is
much
better
that
it
should
be
so
you
have
trusted
me
so
far
and
i
have
no
intention
of
failing
you
now
if
i
say
that
the
crisis
is
near
at
hand
in
a
certain
matter
that
interests
you
greatly
you
will
understand
that
i
am
not
striking
ignorantly
in
the
dark
if
you
know
what
i
suspect
you
know
arnold
ames
you
are
even
shrewder
than
i
thought
you
and
you
had
already
taken
a
high
place
in
my
regard
the
curtains
of
the
windows
just
behind
you
have
shown
considerable
agitation
since
we
have
been
speaking
not
due
i
think
to
the
wind
as
there
is
no
air
stirring
those
gentlemen
you
have
just
vanquished
are
timidly
watching
you
your
daring
and
prowess
have
greatly
alarmed
them
you
may
be
sure
they
will
think
twice
before
provoking
your
wrath
again
i
devoutly
hope
they
will
i
replied
glancing
carelessly
over
my
shoulder
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
henderson
as
he
drew
hastily
out
of
sight
but
will
you
tell
me
just
how
you
came
to
visit
the
inn
at
this
particular
hour
nothing
could
be
simpler
i
had
luncheon
at
the
house
of
a
friend
on
whom
i
called
cecilia
had
left
me
to
continue
her
ride
alone
and
on
my
way
home
i
thought
i
would
ride
by
the
prescott
arms
to
see
how
the
guests
were
faring
you
see
she
paused
and
gave
a
twitch
to
her
hat
to
prolong
my
suspense
you
see
i
own
the
prescott
arms
with
this
she
rode
away
and
not
caring
to
risk
a
further
meeting
with
the
angry
suitors
from
whom
miss
octavia
had
rescued
me
by
so
narrow
a
margin
i
set
off
across
the
fields
toward
hopefield
from
the
stile
i
saw
miss
octavia
in
the
highway
half
a
mile
distant
sending
her
horse
along
at
a
spirited
canter
i
reached
the
house
without
further
adventures
was
served
with
a
cold
luncheon
in
my
room
and
by
the
time
i
had
changed
my
clothes
miss
octavia
sent
me
word
that
pepperton
had
arrived
miss
octavia
and
the
architect
were
conversing
earnestly
when
i
reached
the
library
and
from
the
abruptness
with
which
they
ceased
on
my
entrance
i
imagined
that
i
had
been
the
subject
of
their
talk
pepperton
is
not
only
one
of
the
finest
architects
america
has
produced
but
one
of
the
jolliest
of
fellows
he
grasped
my
hand
cordially
and
pointed
to
the
fireplace
so
you
at
last
found
one
of
my
jobs
to
overhaul
have
you
you
must
let
this
get
out
on
me
old
man
it
would
shatter
my
reputation
please
observe
that
the
flue
is
drawing
splendidly
now
i
answered
a
ghost
had
been
strolling
up
and
down
the
chimney
but
now
that
i
have
found
his
lair
he
will
not
trouble
miss
hollister
fireplaces
again
i
have
waited
for
your
arrival
pepperton
that
we
might
have
the
benefit
of
your
knowledge
of
the
house
in
following
the
trail
of
this
ghost
which
arnold
has
discovered
but
we
must
give
arnold
credit
for
effecting
the
discovery
alone
and
unaided
i
destroyed
the
plans
i
obtained
from
your
office
so
that
arnold
might
be
fully
tested
as
to
his
capacity
for
managing
the
most
difficult
situations
when
miss
octavia
first
referred
to
me
as
arnold
pepperton
raised
his
brows
a
trifle
the
second
time
he
glanced
at
me
laughingly
he
seemed
greatly
amused
by
miss
octavia
seriousness
but
her
amiable
attitude
toward
me
clearly
puzzled
him
it
takes
a
good
man
to
uncover
a
thing
i
try
to
hide
i
said
nothing
to
you
miss
hollister
about
the
retention
within
the
walls
of
this
house
of
parts
of
an
old
one
that
formerly
occupied
the
site
for
the
reason
that
i
thought
you
might
refuse
to
buy
the
estate
the
gentleman
for
whom
i
built
hopefield
was
superstitious
as
many
men
of
advanced
years
are
as
to
the
building
of
a
new
house
and
as
the
site
he
chose
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
county
he
compelled
me
to
construct
this
house
which
is
the
most
satisfactory
i
have
built
in
such
manner
enough
of
the
old
should
be
kept
intact
to
soothe
his
superstitious
soul
with
the
idea
that
he
had
merely
altered
an
old
house
not
built
a
new
one
as
it
is
the
architect
business
to
yield
to
such
caprices
i
obeyed
him
strictly
so
there
are
two
rooms
of
an
old
farmhouse
hidden
under
the
east
wing
and
it
amused
me
once
i
had
got
into
it
to
preserve
part
of
the
old
stairway
and
connect
the
retained
chambers
with
the
upper
hall
of
this
house
i
had
to
patch
the
original
stair
which
was
only
one
flight
with
discarded
lumber
from
the
old
house
but
i
flatter
myself
that
i
managed
it
neatly
i
even
saved
the
old
nails
to
avert
the
wrath
of
the
evil
spirits
when
the
umbrella
and
man
died
for
he
did
die
as
you
know
i
believed
the
secret
had
died
with
him
as
he
was
very
sensitive
about
his
superstitions
most
of
the
laborers
on
that
part
of
the
job
were
brought
from
a
long
distance
and
i
supposed
they
never
really
knew
just
what
we
were
doing
i
might
have
known
though
that
if
a
fellow
as
clever
as
ames
got
to
pecking
at
the
house
the
trick
would
be
discovered
but
the
chimney
old
man
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
with
it
it
will
never
happen
again
and
i
promised
the
ghost
never
to
tell
how
it
was
done
you
were
quite
right
in
doing
that
arnold
a
ghost
secrets
should
be
sacred
but
let
us
now
proceed
to
the
hidden
chambers
said
miss
hollister
rising
without
further
ado
she
summoned
cecilia
to
whom
we
explained
matters
briefly
and
at
pepperton
suggestion
the
four
of
us
went
directly
to
the
fourth
floor
so
that
miss
octavia
might
see
the
whole
contrivance
in
the
most
effective
manner
possible
my
awkward
pen
falters
in
the
attempt
to
convey
any
idea
of
miss
octavia
delight
in
pepperton
revelation
she
kept
repeating
her
admiration
of
his
genius
and
her
praise
of
my
cleverness
which
to
protect
hezekiah
i
was
forced
to
accept
meekly
when
in
broad
daylight
pepperton
found
and
pressed
the
spring
in
the
upper
hall
and
the
hidden
door
opened
with
a
slowness
that
indicated
a
realization
of
its
own
dramatic
value
miss
octavia
cried
out
gleefully
like
a
child
that
witnesses
the
manipulation
of
a
new
and
wonderful
toy
to
think
cecilia
that
i
should
never
have
known
of
this
if
that
chimney
had
not
smoked
a
remark
that
caused
pepperton
to
glance
at
me
curiously
he
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
with
ordinary
care
every
flue
in
that
house
would
have
drawn
splendidly
beyond
any
question
miss
octavia
kept
asserting
beneath
the
chambers
of
the
old
house
down
there
we
shall
find
the
bones
of
that
british
soldier
who
perished
here
or
it
is
even
possible
that
a
chest
of
hidden
treasure
is
concealed
beneath
the
floor
what
do
you
yourself
suspect
mr
pepperton
we
were
lighting
candles
preparatory
to
stepping
down
into
the
dark
stairway
and
pepperton
was
plainly
hard
put
to
keep
from
laughing
i
assure
you
miss
hollister
that
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
about
the
rooms
down
there
i
not
very
strong
in
the
and
our
friend
the
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
i
assure
you
not
even
after
he
had
satisfied
his
fierce
craving
for
pie
miss
octavia
followed
pepperton
slowly
pausing
frequently
to
hold
her
candle
close
to
the
whose
rough
surfaces
confirmed
all
that
pepperton
had
said
of
the
preservation
of
the
old
timbers
i
had
brought
a
handful
of
candles
and
when
we
had
reached
the
dark
rooms
beneath
i
lighted
these
and
set
them
up
in
the
black
corners
of
the
old
rooms
in
which
miss
octavia
remarked
not
even
the
wall
paper
had
been
disturbed
the
exit
into
the
and
concealed
openings
left
for
ventilation
which
had
escaped
me
before
were
now
pointed
out
by
the
architect
who
kept
laughing
at
the
huge
joke
of
it
all
cecilia
murmured
her
surprise
repeatedly
as
we
continued
the
examination
nothing
quite
like
this
had
ever
happened
in
the
world
before
but
even
as
we
walked
through
those
hidden
rooms
my
thoughts
reverted
to
the
crisis
so
near
at
hand
in
her
affairs
i
had
pledged
myself
to
her
service
but
i
saw
no
way
yet
of
assuring
the
proper
sequence
of
proposals
the
ultimate
seventh
must
be
wiggins
but
how
could
i
manage
the
penultimate
sixth
cecilia
own
apparent
freedom
from
care
on
this
tour
of
inspection
deepened
my
sense
of
responsibility
to
all
concerned
dick
might
by
now
have
persuaded
some
one
of
the
others
at
the
inn
to
offer
himself
thus
closing
the
gap
and
i
had
determined
that
the
westerner
should
not
outwit
me
it
was
some
consolation
to
know
that
while
cecilia
was
in
these
lost
rooms
in
my
company
she
was
safe
from
dick
machinations
my
thoughts
were
however
given
a
new
direction
by
miss
octavia
she
had
been
scrutinizing
the
floor
closely
asking
us
all
to
bring
our
candles
to
bear
upon
it
that
she
might
search
thoroughly
for
any
signs
of
a
trapdoor
beneath
which
the
bones
of
the
british
soldier
might
repose
you
ca
tell
me
she
averred
in
her
own
peculiar
vein
that
a
house
as
old
as
this
has
been
preserved
merely
to
divert
calamity
from
a
superstitious
gentleman
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
ribless
umbrellas
and
a
dyspepsia
cure
miss
octavia
hollister
was
a
woman
to
be
humored
we
all
knew
this
but
i
realized
with
a
pang
that
she
was
about
to
be
disappointed
i
had
expected
her
to
forget
the
british
soldier
in
the
perfectly
tangible
joy
of
secret
springs
and
ghostly
chambers
and
if
i
had
foreseen
her
persistence
in
clinging
to
the
tradition
of
the
briton
i
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
hide
a
few
bones
under
the
flooring
miss
octavia
had
brought
a
stick
from
the
and
was
thumping
the
floor
with
it
even
while
pepperton
tried
to
discourage
her
further
investigations
we
were
all
ranged
about
her
with
our
candles
and
these
with
the
others
i
had
thrust
into
the
corners
lighted
the
room
well
i
afraid
you
seen
the
whole
of
it
miss
hollister
said
pepperton
the
old
house
was
built
after
the
revolution
i
judge
but
your
british
soldier
was
probably
left
hanging
to
a
tree
and
never
buried
at
all
pepperton
she
replied
holding
the
candle
so
close
to
the
architect
that
he
blinked
it
would
be
far
from
me
to
question
your
knowledge
of
history
but
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
the
builder
of
this
old
house
had
fought
on
the
seas
with
john
paul
jones
and
had
buried
beneath
these
walls
the
very
that
had
been
his
companion
on
many
eventful
voyages
pepperton
gasped
at
the
absurdity
of
this
and
then
suppressed
his
mirth
with
difficulty
cecilia
faintly
expostulated
but
i
knew
miss
octavia
would
not
be
dissuaded
and
i
thought
it
as
well
to
facilitate
her
search
and
be
done
with
it
a
sailor
with
rings
in
his
ears
and
a
cutlass
dangling
at
his
side
might
have
come
home
from
the
wars
and
established
himself
on
a
farm
in
westchester
county
and
even
buried
his
under
the
floor
of
his
house
but
in
all
likelihood
he
never
had
it
was
not
my
office
however
to
advise
miss
octavia
hollister
in
such
matters
pepperton
had
changed
his
tune
and
seemed
anxious
to
follow
my
lead
to
him
she
was
an
eccentric
old
woman
whose
wealth
alone
gained
her
indulgence
in
such
preposterous
obsessions
as
this
but
my
own
feelings
were
those
of
regret
that
she
must
so
quickly
be
disillusioned
to
me
she
had
become
an
incarnation
of
the
that
never
grows
old
and
there
may
have
risen
in
me
an
honest
belief
that
what
this
unusual
woman
sought
she
would
somehow
find
once
or
twice
when
the
uneven
worn
flooring
had
boomed
hollowly
under
her
stick
i
had
knelt
promptly
to
examine
the
planks
and
had
thus
disposed
of
several
false
alarms
pepperton
feigned
interest
for
a
time
but
was
becoming
bored
cecilia
studied
the
quaint
pattern
of
the
wall
paper
which
she
said
ought
to
be
reproduced
as
nothing
in
contemporaneous
designs
equaled
it
miss
octavia
had
been
over
the
floors
of
the
two
rooms
twice
and
was
about
to
desist
her
less
frequent
appeals
to
the
rest
of
us
for
confirmation
of
some
suspected
change
in
the
responses
to
her
thumping
indicated
disappointment
she
made
her
last
stand
in
the
corner
of
the
smaller
room
and
as
we
all
stood
holding
our
lights
we
were
conscious
that
the
dull
monotonous
thump
suddenly
changed
its
tone
we
all
noticed
it
at
the
same
instant
and
exchanged
glances
of
surprise
do
you
hear
that
gentlemen
she
subdued
her
gratification
in
the
rebuking
glance
she
gave
us
calm
and
unhurried
she
rested
a
moment
on
her
stick
with
the
candle
soft
glow
about
her
a
smile
ineffably
sweet
on
her
face
the
timbers
may
have
rotted
away
underneath
we
did
raise
these
floors
said
pepperton
but
we
both
dropped
to
our
knees
and
brought
all
the
to
bear
upon
the
flooring
dust
and
mortar
shaken
loose
in
the
destruction
of
the
house
filled
the
cracks
pepperton
deeply
absorbed
continued
to
sound
the
corner
with
his
knuckles
it
really
looks
as
though
these
boards
had
been
cut
for
some
purpose
he
said
whipping
out
his
knife
i
ran
to
the
and
found
a
hatchet
and
when
i
returned
he
had
dug
the
dirt
out
of
the
edges
of
the
silence
held
us
all
as
i
set
to
prying
up
the
boards
i
beg
of
you
to
exercise
the
greatest
care
gentlemen
if
bones
are
interred
here
we
must
do
them
no
sacrilege
warned
miss
octavia
by
this
time
we
all
i
think
began
to
believe
that
the
flooring
might
really
have
been
cut
in
this
corner
of
the
old
room
to
permit
the
hiding
of
something
the
room
had
grown
hot
and
cecilia
opened
the
outside
to
admit
air
the
old
planks
clung
stubbornly
their
joists
but
after
i
had
loosened
one
the
others
came
up
quickly
and
the
smell
of
dry
earth
filled
the
room
pepperton
had
at
miss
octavia
direction
brought
a
chisel
and
crowbar
from
the
in
the
cellar
and
he
stood
ready
with
these
when
i
tore
up
the
last
board
disclosing
an
oblong
space
about
five
feet
long
and
slightly
over
three
feet
wide
it
was
possible
that
this
was
the
whole
story
but
pepperton
began
driving
the
bar
vigorously
into
the
soil
as
he
loosened
the
earth
i
scooped
it
out
and
we
soon
had
penetrated
about
six
inches
beneath
the
surface
we
were
all
excited
now
the
edge
of
the
bar
struck
repeatedly
against
something
that
resisted
sharply
it
might
have
been
a
root
but
when
pepperton
shifted
the
point
of
attack
the
same
booming
sound
answered
to
the
prodding
pepperton
now
thought
it
might
be
only
an
empty
cask
or
a
box
of
no
interest
whatever
but
miss
octavia
hovering
close
with
a
candle
encouraged
us
to
go
on
and
was
fertile
in
suggestions
as
to
the
most
expeditious
manner
of
resurrecting
whatever
might
be
buried
there
we
were
pretty
well
satisfied
from
the
soundings
that
the
hidden
object
was
somewhat
shorter
and
narrower
than
the
hole
itself
quite
naturally
so
observed
miss
octavia
for
a
man
who
buries
a
treasure
has
to
allow
himself
room
for
getting
at
it
we
worked
on
silently
pepperton
loosening
the
soil
with
the
bar
while
i
shoveled
it
out
in
half
an
hour
we
had
revealed
a
long
flat
wooden
surface
which
to
our
anxious
imaginations
was
the
lid
of
some
sort
of
box
it
sound
red
cedar
pronounced
pepperton
examining
the
wood
where
the
tools
had
splintered
it
of
course
it
cedar
replied
miss
octavia
bending
down
to
it
i
knew
it
would
be
cedar
it
always
is
we
paused
to
laugh
at
her
confident
tone
and
cecilia
suggested
that
as
there
was
still
a
good
deal
to
do
before
we
could
free
the
box
we
should
send
for
some
of
the
servants
to
complete
the
work
i
would
take
a
thousand
dollars
for
my
chance
at
this
pepperton
answered
and
we
fell
to
again
it
must
have
been
nearly
six
when
we
dragged
out
into
that
chamber
a
stout
box
the
earth
clung
to
its
sides
jealously
and
it
was
bound
with
strips
of
brass
that
shone
brightly
where
the
scraping
of
our
tools
had
burnished
it
we
pried
off
the
heavy
lock
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
and
when
it
was
free
miss
octavia
asserted
her
right
to
the
with
much
calmness
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
allowed
this
opportunity
to
pass
you
must
permit
me
to
have
the
first
look
certainly
miss
hollister
if
it
had
been
for
you
this
chest
would
have
remained
hidden
to
the
end
of
all
time
pepperton
replied
we
gathered
close
about
her
as
she
knelt
beside
the
box
my
hand
shook
as
i
held
my
candle
and
i
think
miss
octavia
was
the
only
one
in
the
room
who
showed
no
nervousness
cecilia
sighed
deeply
several
times
and
pepperton
mopped
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
the
lid
did
not
yield
as
readily
as
we
had
expected
and
it
was
necessary
to
resort
to
the
hatchet
and
chisel
again
but
we
were
careful
that
it
should
be
miss
octavia
hand
that
finally
raised
the
lid
we
all
exclaimed
in
various
keys
as
the
light
fell
upon
the
open
chest
the
musty
odor
of
old
garments
greeted
us
at
once
the
box
was
well
filled
and
its
contents
were
neatly
arranged
miss
octavia
first
lifted
out
the
remnants
of
a
military
uniform
that
lay
on
top
illustration
miss
octavia
first
lifted
out
the
remnants
of
a
military
uniform
that
lay
on
top
it
his
ragged
regimentals
cried
cecilia
as
we
unfolded
an
officer
coat
of
blue
and
buff
sadly
decrepit
and
faded
and
he
was
not
a
british
soldier
at
all
but
an
american
patriot
time
and
service
had
dealt
even
more
harshly
with
an
american
flag
on
which
the
thirteen
white
stars
floated
dimly
on
the
dull
blue
field
it
had
been
bound
tightly
about
a
packet
of
papers
which
miss
octavia
asked
pepperton
to
examine
these
are
commissions
appointing
a
certain
adoniram
caldwell
to
various
positions
in
the
continental
army
adoniram
had
the
right
stuff
in
him
here
he
discharged
as
a
private
to
become
an
ensign
rose
from
ensign
to
colonel
and
seems
to
have
been
in
most
of
the
big
doings
gallantry
in
the
recent
engagement
at
stony
point
on
recommendation
of
general
anthony
wayne
by
jove
that
does
rather
carry
you
back
half
a
dozen
of
these
documents
traced
adoniram
caldwell
career
to
the
end
of
the
revolution
and
his
retirement
from
the
military
service
with
the
rank
of
colonel
a
sealed
letter
attached
to
these
commissions
next
held
our
attention
the
ends
were
dovetailed
in
the
old
style
before
the
day
of
envelopes
and
evidently
care
had
been
taken
in
folding
and
sealing
it
the
superscription
in
a
round
bold
hand
without
flourishes
read
to
whom
it
may
concern
i
suppose
it
concerns
us
as
much
as
anybody
remarked
miss
octavia
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
shall
we
open
it
we
all
demanded
breathlessly
that
she
break
the
seal
and
we
were
soon
bending
over
her
with
our
lights
the
ink
had
blurred
and
in
spots
rust
had
obliterated
the
writing
i
roger
hartley
wiggins
sometime
known
as
adoniram
caldwell
hartley
wiggins
we
gasped
and
i
felt
cecilia
hand
clasp
my
arm
miss
octavia
continued
reading
and
as
she
was
obliged
to
pause
often
and
refer
illegible
lines
to
the
rest
of
us
i
have
copied
the
following
from
the
letter
itself
with
only
slight
changes
of
punctuation
and
spelling
i
roger
hartley
wiggins
sometime
known
as
adoniram
caldwell
having
now
resumed
my
proper
name
and
being
about
to
marry
and
having
begun
the
construction
of
a
habitation
for
myself
wherein
to
end
my
days
truthfully
set
forth
these
matters
my
father
hiram
wiggins
of
rhode
island
having
supported
the
royalist
cause
in
our
late
war
for
independence
and
angered
by
my
friendliness
to
the
patriots
and
he
with
brothers
and
sister
having
returned
to
england
after
the
evacuation
of
boston
i
joined
the
continental
troops
under
general
putnam
on
long
island
in
july
serving
in
various
commands
thereafter
to
the
best
of
my
ability
to
the
end
my
father
has
now
returned
to
rhode
island
and
has
i
learn
been
making
inquiries
touching
my
whereabouts
and
condition
so
that
i
have
every
hope
that
we
may
become
reconciled
yet
as
my
services
to
the
country
were
against
his
wishes
and
caused
so
much
harshness
and
heartache
and
being
now
come
into
a
part
of
the
country
where
i
am
unknown
i
am
decided
to
resume
my
rightful
name
that
my
wife
and
children
may
bear
it
and
in
the
hope
that
i
may
myself
yet
add
to
it
some
honor
nor
shall
my
wife
or
any
children
that
may
be
born
to
me
know
from
me
yet
not
caring
to
destroy
my
sword
which
i
bore
with
some
credit
nor
these
testimonials
of
respect
and
confidence
i
received
as
adoniram
caldwell
at
various
times
and
from
various
personages
of
renown
both
civilians
and
in
the
military
service
i
place
them
under
my
house
now
building
where
i
hope
in
god
care
to
end
my
days
in
peace
i
would
in
like
case
make
like
choice
again
ten
lines
following
this
were
wholly
illegible
but
just
before
the
date
june
and
the
signature
which
was
written
large
was
this
god
preserve
these
american
states
that
they
endure
in
unity
and
concord
forever
we
had
all
been
moved
by
the
reading
of
this
letter
and
miss
octavia
voice
had
faltered
several
times
as
i
turned
to
cecilia
once
or
twice
during
the
recital
of
the
dead
patriot
message
i
saw
tears
brimming
her
eyes
wiggins
once
told
me
that
his
had
lived
somewhere
in
westchester
county
but
i
fancy
he
had
no
idea
that
hopefield
was
the
identical
spot
remarked
miss
octavia
it
seems
incredible
and
yet
i
dare
say
the
hand
of
fate
is
in
it
oh
it
so
wonderful
so
beyond
belief
cried
cecilia
reverently
folding
the
letter
which
i
observed
she
retained
in
her
own
hands
it
wonderful
added
miss
octavia
promptly
taking
the
sword
which
pepperton
had
with
difficulty
drawn
from
its
battered
scabbard
that
even
a
discerning
woman
like
me
could
have
been
so
mistaken
i
recall
with
humility
that
last
fourth
of
july
at
berlin
i
reprimanded
wiggins
severely
because
his
family
had
not
been
represented
in
the
war
for
american
independence
by
the
irony
of
circumstances
it
becomes
my
duty
to
present
to
him
the
very
sword
that
his
admirable
bore
in
that
momentous
struggle
i
shall
with
his
permission
place
a
bronze
tablet
on
the
outer
wall
of
this
house
to
preserve
the
patriot
memory
several
copies
of
new
york
newspapers
half
a
dozen
french
gold
coins
the
miniature
of
a
woman
face
which
we
assumed
to
be
that
of
roger
wiggins
mother
or
sister
were
briefly
examined
then
by
miss
octavia
orders
we
carefully
returned
everything
to
the
chest
several
packets
of
letters
we
did
not
open
arnold
she
said
when
we
had
closed
the
chest
will
you
and
pepperton
kindly
carry
that
box
to
my
room
no
servant
hand
shall
touch
it
and
i
shall
myself
give
it
to
wiggins
at
the
earliest
opportunity
we
had
lost
track
of
time
in
those
hidden
rooms
preserved
by
the
whim
of
one
man
that
the
secret
of
another
might
be
discovered
and
found
with
surprise
after
the
chest
had
been
carried
to
miss
apartments
that
it
was
after
seven
we
had
been
in
the
hidden
rooms
for
more
than
three
hours
we
shall
have
much
to
talk
about
and
i
fancy
we
are
all
a
good
deal
shaken
it
not
often
we
receive
a
letter
from
a
dead
man
so
we
shall
admit
no
callers
unless
indeed
wiggins
should
chance
to
come
announced
miss

the
next
time
hartley
wiggins
visits
this
house
he
shall
come
as
a
conquering
hero
i
hope
so
replied
cecilia
brokenly
we
were
still
at
dinner
when
the
cards
of
dick
and
the
other
suitors
i
had
last
seen
at
the
prescott
arms
were
brought
in
but
wiggins
made
no
sign
and
i
wondered
xx
hezekiah
partitions
the
kingdom
the
man
who
looked
after
my
needs
handed
me
a
note
the
next
morning
which
added
fresh
hazards
to
cecilia
already
perilous
plight
left
with
the
gardener
before
six
by
a
boy
from
the
village
said
it
was
most
confidential
sir
i
waited
till
he
had
left
the
room
before
opening
it
a
square
white
envelope
addressed
to
arnold
ames
hopefield
manor
told
me
nothing
and
the
handwriting
was
inscrutable
it
slanted
slightly
upward
the
small
letters
were
and
quaintly
shaded
if
a
woman
she
had
scorned
the
models
of
the
if
a
man
but
i
knew
its
gender
well
enough
the
white
note
sheet
within
was
unadorned
and
the
same
pen
had
traced
compactly
within
the
widest
possible
margins
the
following
gooseberry
bungalow
before
breakfast
dear
chimneys
pep
stopped
here
yesterday
to
see
he
and
old
pals
watch
him
where
wig
the
initials
were
superfluous
and
yet
the
sight
of
them
pleased
me
mightily
in
her
she
curved
the
pillars
of
the
h
like
parentheses
so
that
they
bore
an
amusing
resemblance
to
four
men
striding
forward
against
a
storm
the
report
of
a
chief
of
scouts
smuggled
through
the
enemy
lines
could
not
have
improved
on
her
billet
for
succinctness
and
the
information
conveyed
was
startling
enough
we
had
been
dealing
with
a
company
of
suitors
outside
the
barricade
now
came
warning
of
the
presence
of
a
strange
knight
within
the
gates
who
greatly
multiplied
the
perils
of
the
situation
the
compact
between
the
suitors
at
the
inn
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
i
now
expected
them
to
exercise
all
the
ingenuity
of
which
desperate
lovers
are
capable
in
pressing
their
claims
the
fact
that
both
wiggins
and
pepperton
were
old
friends
of
mine
did
not
make
my
task
easier
i
not
only
felt
it
incumbent
on
me
to
prevent
dick
the
holder
of
the
clue
from
taking
advantage
of
it
but
knowing
cecilia
own
attitude
of
mind
and
heart
toward
wiggins
i
wished
to
save
pepperton
the
pain
of
rejection
if
it
could
be
done
but
what
did
hezekiah
mean
by
the
question
with
which
she
ended
her
note
if
wiggins
smarting
under
cecilia
treatment
of
him
the
day
before
had
quit
the
field
here
was
a
pretty
f
miss
octavia
refusal
to
countenance
telephones
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
leave
hopefield
to
learn
what
had
become
of
wiggins
and
i
realized
that
i
must
act
promptly
if
i
saved
the
day
for
him
his
conduct
first
and
last
had
been
spiritless
and
i
was
out
of
patience
with
him
it
seemed
impossible
to
formulate
any
plan
amidst
these
multiplying
uncertainties
if
wiggins
had
decamped
dick
knew
it
and
would
lay
his
plans
accordingly
i
felt
that
it
was
base
ingratitude
on
part
to
ask
me
to
watch
his
interests
while
he
went
roaming
indifferently
over
the
country
one
or
two
consoling
reflections
remained
however
dick
believed
me
to
be
a
suitor
for
cecilia
hand
and
this
doubtless
caused
him
considerable
uneasiness
and
he
did
not
know
that
pepperton
whose
acquaintance
with
cecilia
antedated
the
european
flight
had
to
be
reckoned
with
i
wished
pepperton
had
kept
out
of
it
breakfast
that
morning
was
interminably
long
miss
octavia
was
never
more
thoroughly
amusing
never
more
drolly
inadvertent
she
attacked
pepperton
for
all
the
evils
in
american
architecture
and
in
particular
took
him
to
task
for
some
house
he
had
built
at
newport
which
she
pronounced
the
most
hideous
pile
of
marble
on
american
soil
from
her
packet
of
she
drew
a
letter
her
brother
bassford
had
written
to
the
sun
the
writing
of
letters
to
newspapers
was
it
seemed
one
of
his
weaknesses
protesting
against
the
quality
of
the
music
ground
from
the
new
york
the
selections
were
execrable
the
fierce
tempo
at
which
the
instruments
were
driven
had
caused
an
alarming
increase
in
insanity
in
proof
of
which
he
adduced
statistics
he
demanded
municipal
censorship
and
volunteered
to
sit
on
the
proposed
commission
of
critics
without
pay
that
is
just
like
brother
bassford
when
i
begin
speaking
to
him
again
i
shall
point
out
the
error
of
his
ways
i
always
miss
the
when
i
in
the
country
and
i
believe
i
shall
buy
one
and
have
it
play
me
to
sleep
at
night
the
faster
the
tempo
the
sweeter
the
slumber
i
should
certainly
do
so
she
concluded
with
that
indefinable
smile
that
always
left
one
wondering
if
it
were
not
that
my
new
laundress
is
a
graduate
of
the
conservatory
of
music
and
i
fear
the
toreador
song
on
wheels
might
be
painful
to
one
of
her
taste
and
temperament
when
we
left
the
table
at
about
ten
miss
octavia
insisted
that
we
must
visit
the
kennels
a
friend
had
just
sent
her
a
fine
airedale
and
she
wished
to
make
sure
the
was
treating
the
dog
properly
later
we
were
all
to
ride
i
made
haste
to
excuse
myself
saying
that
personal
matters
required
attention
certainly
arnold
you
shall
do
as
you
like
pepperton
is
a
difficult
bird
to
catch
so
we
hope
for
you
at
luncheon
and
of
course
we
expect
you
for
dinner
pepperton
looked
at
me
inquiringly
i
judged
that
he
had
known
miss
octavia
a
good
many
years
the
tone
of
their
intercourse
was
intimate
and
yet
he
plainly
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
just
how
i
came
to
be
so
thoroughly
established
in
her
good
graces
i
confess
that
as
i
glance
back
over
these
pages
it
looks
odd
to
me
as
i
paced
the
hall
waiting
for
a
horse
to
be
saddled
pepperton
led
me
out
on
the
terrace
above
the
garden
i
bursting
with
a
great
secret
old
man
i
going
to
be
married
what
i
going
to
be
married
i
grasped
a
chair
to
support
myself
this
was
almost
too
much
could
it
be
possible
that
hezekiah
had
miscalculated
the
list
of
rejections
in
the
book
or
that
cecilia
herself
had
been
deceived
pepperton
misread
my
agitation
and
with
a
hearty
laugh
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
oh
i
not
intruding
on
your
preserves
old
man
cecilia
is
the
second
finest
girl
in
the
world
that
all
i
engaged
to
miss
gaylord
of
stockbridge
i
telling
a
few
old
friends
in
advance
of
the
formal
announcement
to
be
made
next
week
at
a
dance
the
gaylords
are
giving
i
crushed
his
hand
in
both
my
own
and
seeing
that
he
misconstrued
the
fervor
of
my
emotion
i
hastened
to
set
myself
right
you
a
lucky
dog
as
usual
pep
but
you
do
understand
about
cecilia
hollister
it
not
i
i
not
in
the
running
at
all
but
hartley
wiggins
is
i
here
trying
to
help
him
score
what
this
you
here
to
represent
wiggy
well
he
did
exactly
send
me
here
but
when
i
came
i
found
that
wiggy
was
playing
the
game
with
quite
the
necessary
zipology
there
more
required
than
appears
a
little
of
the
dash
and
snap
of
the
old
adventures
the
ready
tongue
the
eager
thirsty
sword
pepperton
pursed
his
lips
and
looked
me
over
carefully
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
you
are
contributing
those
elements
you
are
octaviaized
is
that
it
pepperton
laughed
until
the
tears
came
i
prefer
hollisterized
as
the
broader
term
brother
bassford
has
it
too
and
there
always
hezekiah
ah
hezekiah
the
unpredictable
i
knew
there
was
a
skirt
fluttering
somewhere
i
saw
her
yesterday
stopped
to
see
bassford
who
a
good
old
chap
hezekiah
of
the
teasing
eyes
was
whitewashing
the
and
michael
angelo
could
have
done
it
better
pep
i
said
lowering
my
voice
if
you
love
me
keep
close
to
cecilia
all
day
you
an
engaged
man
and
in
practice
give
an
imitation
of
devotion
keep
her
out
of
doors
keep
male
human
beings
away
from
her
do
fail
me
in
this
i
got
to
pull
off
the
greatest
coup
of
my
life
there
a
band
of
outlaws
hanging
round
here
who
will
propose
to
cecilia
the
first
chance
they
get
and
they
must
not
wig
got
to
speak
before
night
or
lose
out
forever
no
not
a
word
of
explanation
you
got
to
take
my
word
for
it
i
be
the
goat
go
ahead
but
build
a
fire
under
wiggins
i
stay
here
forever
pepperton
engagement
smoothed
out
one
wrinkle
and
i
felt
sure
that
i
could
trust
him
as
an
ally
the
groom
was
holding
my
horse
in
the
and
i
mounted
and
rode
away
to
the
prescott
arms
i
found
ormsby
shallenberger
arbuthnot
henderson
hume
and
gorse
glumly
sitting
in
a
semicircle
before
the
hall
fireplace
deepest
gloom
pervaded
the
inn
i
have
rarely
seen
melancholy
so
darkly
stamped
upon
the
human
countenance
they
turned
indifferently
and
glared
as
they
recognized
me
shallenberger
alone
rose
and
greeted
me
i
hope
there
is
no
bad
news
he
said
chokingly
bad
news
i
mean
miss
hollister
miss
cecilia
we
were
all
deeply
grieved
last
night
to
hear
of
her
sudden
illness
there
always
something
so
terrible
in
the
very
name
of
diphtheria
my
wits
had
been
so
sharpened
by
my
late
adventures
that
i
readily
accounted
for
these
false
tidings
dick
was
absent
dick
alone
would
have
been
equal
to
this
diabolical
plot
for
keeping
his
rival
suitors
away
from
hopefield
the
despair
in
those
faces
taxed
my
gravity
severely
it
is
extremely
sad
but
the
first
diagnosis
was
erroneous
i
answered
i
think
it
more
likely
to
prove
to
be
when
the
truth
is
known
not
diphtheria
no
immediate
danger
of
diphtheria
i
assure
you
i
replied
though
of
course
with
winter
coming
on
and
all
that
one
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
while
he
repeated
this
to
the
others
i
sought
the
clerk
who
promptly
handed
me
a
note
which
wiggins
had
left
late
the
previous
afternoon
to
be
delivered
in
case
i
called
he
had
gone
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
orton
the
playwright
who
was
at
his
country
house
in
the
hills
beyond
mt
kisco
rehearsing
a
new
piece
in
which
a
friend
of
hartley
was
to
star
i
gained
the
in
one
jump
and
in
five
minutes
i
was
bawling
wildly
into
orton
ear
i
had
known
him
well
in
the
hare
and
tortoise
and
he
answered
my
demand
for
wiggins
with
the
news
that
hartley
had
ridden
off
with
some
other
guests
in
the
house
orton
did
know
where
i
threw
them
out
i
got
to
rewrite
my
third
act
i
do
care
whether
they
ever
come
back
boomed
orton
voice
if
you
do
send
wiggins
back
to
me
at
hopefield
as
fast
as
he
can
get
there
my
third
act
is
ruined
what
tell
wiggins
to
come
back
on
the
run
tell
him
the
world
coming
to
an
end
any
minute
i
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
snapped
orton
in
the
harried
tone
of
a
man
whose
third
act
has
wilted
in
rehearsal
as
i
came
perspiring
out
of
the
i
found
the
suitors
engaged
in
eager
but
subdued
debate
by
the
hearth
they
could
hardly
have
heard
my
bleatings
over
the
telephone
but
they
were
greatly
concerned
about
something
shallenberger
who
was
apparently
the
only
one
willing
to
approach
me
followed
me
to
the
veranda
those
fellows
in
there
do
understand
this
dick
told
us
all
last
night
after
we
had
called
at
the
house
and
been
refused
admittance
that
miss
cecilia
was
ill
with
diphtheria
i
remember
that
it
was
dick
who
rang
the
bell
and
gave
our
cards
to
the
footman
it
was
quite
singular
you
know
our
being
turned
away
unless
something
had
been
wrong
i
bowed
gravely
they
had
been
turned
away
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
after
unearthing
adoniram
caldwell
effects
in
the
secret
rooms
of
her
house
miss
octavia
had
not
cared
to
be
troubled
with
suitors
the
haughty
nebraskan
had
drawn
upon
his
imagination
for
the
rest
and
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
miss
hollister
malady
is
not
diphtheria
but
shallenberger
persisted
with
almost
laughable
trepidation
these
gentlemen
i
regret
to
say
go
so
far
as
to
doubt
your
word
that
shallenberger
is
their
privilege
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
merely
tried
to
mitigate
the
terrible
news
imparted
by
dick
you
are
rank
ingrates
for
questioning
my
far
less
doubtful
story
anything
between
you
gentlemen
and
dick
is
of
course
none
of
my
affair
for
whether
considered
as
a
set
group
or
bunch
i
am
done
with
the
whole
lot
of
you
farewell
i
decided
as
i
rode
away
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
going
in
search
of
wiggins
orton
had
purposely
made
his
house
difficult
of
access
and
the
roads
in
that
neighborhood
are
many
and
devious
orton
had
banished
his
guests
that
he
might
tinker
his
play
in
peace
and
knowing
his
temper
i
was
sure
that
wiggins
and
the
rest
of
them
would
keep
out
of
his
way
till
the
pangs
of
hunger
drove
them
back
i
had
ridden
half
a
mile
toward
hopefield
when
i
espied
a
woman
riding
rapidly
toward
me
and
as
she
drew
nearer
i
identified
her
as
hezekiah
mounted
on
a
horse
i
recognized
as
one
of
the
best
in
miss
stables
hezekiah
rode
astride
as
a
woman
should
her
bicycle
skirt
serving
well
as
a
habit
she
rode
as
a
boy
rides
who
loves
freedom
and
quickened
pulses
and
the
rush
of
wind
across
his
face
she
was
hatless
for
which
the
sun
and
i
were
both
grateful
the
big
bow
at
the
back
of
her
head
turned
the
dial
back
to
sixteen
illustration
i
espied
a
woman
riding
rapidly
toward
me
she
drew
rein
and
fished
what
seemed
to
be
salted
almonds
from
her
sweater
pocket
she
filliped
one
of
these
into
the
air
and
caught
it
in
her
mouth
with
a
lazy
toss
of
the
head
that
showed
the
firm
contour
of
her
lovely
throat
i
had
never
seen
her
more
do
you
care
much
for
this
horse
she
asked
carelessly
it
a
good
horse
i
fancy
miss
octavia
thinks
so
herself
there
are
places
hezekiah
where
they
hang
people
for
thought
i
might
need
one
so
i
borrowed
him
through
the
back
way
to
the
old
red
barn
the
coachman
is
an
ancient
chum
and
aunt
octavia
would
never
mind
even
if
she
knew
and
she
will
know
all
right
anyhow
my
rear
tire
had
been
patched
once
too
often
and
there
is
a
satisfaction
in
a
horse
where
our
sensitive
and
impressionable
wiggy
saw
him
riding
over
toward
kisco
yesterday
with
chin
on
his
chest
dreadful
riding
form
wiggins
is
at
orton
the
playwright
you
know
i
telephoned
him
to
hustle
back
but
he
out
of
our
reach
somewhere
i
could
speak
to
him
direct
had
to
leave
a
message
for
him
just
like
wiggy
to
die
on
the
last
lap
what
did
you
make
out
of
brother
pepperton
your
note
scared
me
thanks
so
much
for
your
note
but
he
all
right
engaged
to
another
girl
ah
she
sighed
it
comforting
that
cecilia
could
keep
them
all
going
all
the
time
we
rode
along
together
our
horses
in
a
walk
and
i
told
her
everything
i
knew
of
the
condition
of
affairs
including
a
true
account
of
my
experiences
at
the
inn
the
day
before
and
of
the
finding
of
the
old
chest
belonging
to
wiggins
her
brown
eyes
opened
wide
at
this
concluding
with
the
diphtheria
stratagem
and
menace
to
cecilia
happiness
he
really
a
bright
little
boy
coming
home
on
the
steamer
he
gave
me
a
course
in
pragmatism
that
i
found
helpful
in
keeping
house
for
papa
it
too
bad
we
have
to
lay
a
trap
for
mr
dick
is
it
just
how
are
we
to
manage
that
hezekiah
oh
that
will
be
easy
enough
he
pretty
desperate
and
since
the
compact
between
the
suitors
has
gone
to
pieces
he
knows
he
will
have
to
show
his
hand
pretty
soon
he
thinks
you
are
wild
about
cecilia
he
lays
great
stress
on
his
thinking
powers
and
he
probably
argues
that
you
are
bound
to
pop
pretty
soon
it
just
as
well
he
thinks
so
but
we
must
finish
this
up
i
be
a
nervous
wreck
if
we
close
the
books
there
your
friend
dick
now
she
indicated
a
high
point
in
the
main
road
where
it
crossed
the
ridge
from
which
she
had
shown
me
it
seemed
oh
very
long
ago
the
procession
of
suitors
crossing
the
stile
dick
mounted
was
gazing
off
across
the
fields
toward
hopefield
man
and
horse
were
so
distant
as
to
create
the
illusion
of
an
equestrian
statue
on
a
high
pedestal
napoleon
before
waterloo
i
suggested
he
does
look
like
napoleon
does
he
she
laughed
he
a
bit
fussed
he
knows
that
wiggy
not
at
the
inn
and
that
you
are
up
to
something
and
to
little
dick
the
architect
probably
looks
like
one
of
those
mysterious
knights
you
read
about
who
suddenly
appears
at
the
tournament
all
canned
in
an
freezer
with
a
tin
pail
over
his
head
pepperton
presence
no
doubt
worries
him
as
i
do
think
they
ever
met
cecilia
and
pepperton
are
riding
i
dodged
them
just
before
i
struck
you
walking
their
horses
in
the
most
loverlike
fashion
in
a
lane
over
yonder
but
if
pepperton
is
really
engaged
it
all
right
though
if
i
were
the
other
girl
i
think
i
be
anxious
pep
playing
the
game
that
all
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
she
glanced
at
the
sun
i
fancy
that
it
was
with
such
a
scanning
of
the
heavens
that
her
sisters
a
thousand
years
before
had
noted
the
time
this
is
my
there
undoubtedly
a
waiting
for
me
at
the
bungalow
and
papa
will
expect
me
for
luncheon
i
ask
you
to
come
too
only
you
have
all
you
can
do
to
keep
dick
from
persuading
somebody
to
be
the
sixth
man
so
he
can
slip
in
as
number
seven
if
we
get
through
all
right
you
may
come
for
luncheon
maybe
papa
told
me
he
liked
you
he
said
you
were
very
decent
that
night
you
met
him
on
the
roof
of
aunt
octavia
house
my
compliments
to
your
father
i
hope
to
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
extend
his
paternal
arm
to
include
me
aunt
octavia
must
be
my
aunt
too
really
cried
hezekiah
with
indescribable
mockery
and
she
wheeled
her
horse
and
was
gone
like
the
wind
luncheon
at
hopefield
passed
without
incident
and
afterward
cecilia
retired
to
help
her
aunt
with
her
correspondence
while
pepperton
and
i
lounged
about
the
house
and
smoked
i
told
him
of
my
ineffectual
efforts
to
reach
wiggins
and
he
volunteered
to
find
a
motor
and
search
for
him
but
i
pointed
out
the
futility
of
this
and
renewed
my
appeal
that
he
stay
on
guard
at
hopefield
at
about
three
cecilia
reappeared
her
color
was
high
and
her
eyes
were
unusually
brilliant
i
knew
that
she
fully
realized
that
the
crisis
was
near
but
she
asked
no
questions
and
her
manner
reassured
me
of
her
confidence
we
idled
on
the
stone
terrace
above
the
garden
which
in
its
ruin
still
satisfied
the
eye
with
color
i
had
purposely
drawn
some
chairs
to
a
corner
well
screened
by
vines
so
that
i
could
note
the
approach
of
any
visitors
who
came
cross
country
by
way
of
the
stile
we
were
hardly
seated
before
dick
entered
the
garden
followed
immediately
by
the
six
other
suitors
i
had
last
seen
at
the
inn
they
ranged
themselves
on
a
stone
bench
facing
the
house
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
paths
they
wore
sack
coats
and
hats
in
a
variety
of
styles
so
that
they
did
not
present
quite
the
bizarre
effect
produced
by
their
frock
coats
and
silk
tiles
they
surveyed
the
house
sadly
bowed
their
heads
upon
their
sticks
and
seemed
to
have
come
to
stay
the
siege
then
had
become
a
practical
matter
why
do
the
gentlemen
come
in
asked
cecilia
peering
through
the
vines
hush
there
a
rumor
that
you
are
terribly
ill
they
come
merely
to
pay
their
tribute
of
respect
by
waiting
in
the
garden
you
had
better
go
quietly
into
the
house
the
shock
of
seeing
you
in
your
usual
health
might
be
too
much
for
them
but
i
ca
i
must
be
accessible
at
all
times
she
cried
looking
helplessly
from
me
to
pepperton
who
was
all
at
sea
for
an
explanation
if
that
impression
is
abroad
i
shall
appear
at
once
then
you
and
pepperton
must
patrol
the
terrace
here
you
are
lovers
for
all
i
know
ignore
them
utterly
in
your
absorption
with
one
another
if
any
one
approaches
you
pepperton
ask
miss
hollister
to
marry
you
me
gasped
pepperton
no
it
ca
be
done
that
way
cecilia
interposed
pepperton
has
told
me
of
his
engagement
i
ca
be
party
to
a
fraud
a
trick
i
ca
countenance
it
at
all
it
would
ruin
everything
then
stay
right
here
pace
back
and
forth
and
i
manage
the
rest
i
do
for
the
life
of
me
know
how
but
i
do
it
as
cecilia
and
pepperton
stepped
from
behind
the
screen
of
vines
the
men
on
the
benches
lifted
their
heads
then
i
heard
murmurs
of
amazement
and
chagrin
and
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
dick
tearing
through
the
hedge
with
his
late
companions
tumbling
after
in
fierce
pursuit
i
ran
to
the
stable
and
found
a
horse
feeling
that
i
must
be
in
a
position
to
move
rapidly
if
i
saw
wiggins
approaching
if
dick
eluded
his
wrathful
pursuers
he
would
be
on
the
lookout
somewhere
awaiting
his
own
time
and
if
he
saw
wiggins
rushing
madly
for
the
house
he
might
yet
circumvent
us
i
satisfied
myself
that
cecilia
and
pepperton
were
still
plainly
visible
from
the
garden
and
i
knew
that
for
the
time
she
was
safe
i
gained
the
high
point
in
the
road
from
which
hezekiah
and
i
had
observed
dick
on
guard
at
noon
and
waited
remembering
the
fine
figure
the
philosopher
had
made
against
the
sky
i
dismounted
and
rested
by
a
stone
wall
where
i
could
watch
with
less
risk
of
being
seen
from
a
distance
i
at
once
saw
matters
that
interested
me
immensely
dick
had
thrown
off
the
other
suitors
and
was
rapidly
crossing
the
fields
toward
hopefield
when
i
caught
sight
of
him
he
was
just
leaving
the
orchard
where
hezekiah
and
i
had
held
our
memorable
interview
a
long
stretch
of
rough
pasture
lay
before
him
and
he
settled
down
to
a
quick
trot
he
took
several
fences
without
lessening
his
gait
crossed
the
stile
like
a
flash
a
little
later
and
was
out
of
sight
as
i
turned
to
my
horse
i
heard
the
swift
patter
of
hoofs
and
saw
a
man
and
woman
galloping
furiously
toward
me
they
were
rapidly
nearing
the
ridge
and
their
horses
were
springing
over
the
firm
white
road
in
prodigious
leaps
wiggins
had
got
my
message
hezekiah
had
met
him
in
the
road
and
was
urging
him
on
here
indeed
was
a
situation
to
stir
the
heart
and
the
blood
sang
in
my
ears
as
i
watched
them
i
waved
my
arm
as
they
checked
their
horses
for
the
long
climb
the
riders
had
lost
their
hats
in
their
mad
race
and
wiggins
horse
was
nearly
done
for
as
they
came
still
nearer
i
saw
that
wiggins
had
taken
fire
at
last
orton
said
some
one
was
killed
who
what
who
i
just
picked
him
up
five
minutes
ago
he
does
know
anything
said
hezekiah
and
you
dare
tell
him
remember
the
rules
doing
she
inquired
coolly
she
bade
wiggins
exchange
horses
with
her
and
while
he
was
readjusting
the
i
explained
to
hezekiah
the
situation
at
hopefield
and
told
her
of
dick
scamper
across
the
fields
there
no
use
fooling
with
this
thing
any
more
i
take
wiggy
to
the
house
and
lock
him
up
until
i
been
numbered
six
it
safest
not
much
it
is
i
do
intend
that
cecilia
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
refusing
you
i
like
to
know
why
not
it
only
to
fill
the
gap
oh
said
hezekiah
that
would
be
an
embarrassment
to
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
listen
carefully
take
wiggy
in
by
the
back
way
and
give
him
a
to
look
at
leave
cecilia
alone
on
the
terrace
when
you
all
ready
and
see
what
happens
if
dick
on
his
way
to
the
house
he
going
to
do
something
and
he
must
feel
the
edge
of
my
displeasure
i
owe
him
a
few
on
general
principles
what
does
all
this
mean
you
say
there
nothing
wrong
at
the
house
began
wiggins
as
we
left
hezekiah
and
started
toward
hopefield
nothing
whatever
the
matter
everything
perfectly
all
right
but
you
got
to
keep
mum
now
and
do
what
i
tell
you
i
worked
hard
for
you
old
man
and
when
it
all
over
i
going
to
send
you
a
bill
for
professional
services
come
i
urged
my
horse
to
his
utmost
and
wiggins
rode
steadily
beside
me
the
fright
orton
had
given
him
had
done
my
friend
good
and
i
felt
that
i
was
dealing
with
a
live
man
at
last
our
speed
did
not
permit
conversation
but
feeling
that
wiggins
was
entitled
to
some
further
assurance
i
waited
until
we
were
climbing
our
last
hill
to
add
a
word
i
tell
you
all
about
this
after
we
have
a
cigar
you
know
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
help
and
if
nothing
goes
wrong
and
hezekiah
does
fail
you
will
see
the
world
with
new
eyes
before
you
sleep
we
rode
direct
to
the
stable
and
i
took
wiggins
to
my
room
by
the
back
stairs
and
bade
him
help
himself
to
my
raiment
he
was
perfectly
tractable
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
he
trusted
implicitly
to
my
guidance
i
met
miss
octavia
in
the
lower
hall
she
was
just
in
from
the
kennels
her
new
airedale
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
breed
she
declared
and
she
announced
her
intention
of
exhibiting
him
at
all
the
reputable
bench
shows
in
america
i
hope
arnold
that
you
have
not
been
without
entertainment
miss
hollister
the
three
musketeers
were
fat
monks
asleep
under
the
sunny
wall
of
a
monastery
compared
with
me
i
am
glad
you
are
not
bored
by
the
way
if
you
should
by
any
chance
see
hezekiah
you
will
kindly
intimate
to
her
that
if
she
returns
that
estabrook
mare
she
borrowed
this
morning
in
reasonably
good
condition
i
will
overlook
her
indiscretion
in
taking
it
from
the
stable
without
permission
she
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
but
continued
on
to
her
room
and
i
went
direct
to
the
terrace
cecilia
and
pepperton
were
just
going
into
the
house
to
look
up
a
book
or
piece
of
music
which
they
had
been
discussing
cecilia
was
making
herself
interesting
as
she
so
well
knew
how
to
do
and
she
seemed
in
no
wise
anxious
we
had
forgotten
tea
she
said
aunt
octavia
has
just
ordered
it
she
and
pepperton
may
have
their
tea
i
believe
the
air
outside
will
do
you
good
for
a
little
longer
so
if
you
do
mind
pepperton
miss
hollister
will
resume
her
promenade
alone
pep
has
told
me
since
that
he
thought
me
quite
mad
that
afternoon
i
bade
cecilia
patrol
the
long
terrace
slowly
she
turned
up
the
collar
of
the
covert
coat
and
obeyed
laughing
a
little
nervously
but
asking
no
questions
the
scene
could
not
have
been
more
charmingly
set
the
great
house
loomed
darkly
behind
her
beneath
lay
the
garden
over
which
the
dusk
was
stealing
goldenly
she
paused
suddenly
as
i
watched
from
the
window
and
i
stepped
out
to
see
what
had
attracted
her
attention
there
into
the
garden
from
its
farther
entrance
filed
the
six
suitors
who
had
previously
come
to
sit
beneath
the
windows
of
their
stricken
lady
having
failed
to
visit
their
wrath
upon
the
perfidious
dick
they
had
changed
their
clothes
and
returned
to
hopefield
if
hezekiah
had
not
expressly
commanded
me
not
to
become
the
sixth
man
i
should
have
offered
myself
on
the
spot
and
waited
only
until
cecilia
had
made
the
inevitable
answer
before
summoning
wiggins
to
end
the
whole
affair
such
however
was
not
to
be
the
order
of
events
the
procession
headed
by
ormsby
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
terrace
cecilia
apparently
unconscious
of
their
proximity
continued
her
promenade
in
a
moment
she
must
recognize
them
ask
them
into
the
house
give
them
tea
and
otherwise
destroy
my
hope
of
securing
her
happiness
before
the
day
end
a
chorus
of
yelps
and
barks
as
of
dogs
suddenly
released
greeted
my
ear
the
oncoming
suitors
heard
it
too
and
the
line
wobbled
uncertainly
then
round
the
house
swept
mastiffs
hounds
terriers
a
collection
of
such
as
few
kennels
ever
boasted
loping
gayly
in
unwonted
freedom
toward
unknown
and
forbidden
pastures
the
vanguard
of
leaped
down
into
the
garden
with
the
rest
of
the
pack
at
their
heels
happy
dogs
to
find
grown
men
ready
for
a
gambol
six
streamed
from
the
hips
of
six
gentlemen
in
a
hurry
several
battered
hats
mixed
with
geraniums
were
retained
later
as
spoils
of
war
by
the
gardener
that
garden
had
been
built
for
repose
and
contemplative
amblings
not
for
panic
and
flight
the
disorder
was
superior
in
picturesqueness
to
that
which
attended
the
pumpkin
stampede
at
least
it
struck
me
at
the
moment
as
funnier
and
i
have
never
since
been
able
to
attend
a
day
wedding
without
appearing
idiotic
the
procession
of
ushers
suggests
possibilities
that
are
too
much
for
me
four
of
the
suitors
found
one
of
the
proper
exits
into
the
road
two
leaped
the
on
the
other
side
without
shaking
a
leaf
i
ran
round
the
house
stumbling
through
the
of
the
truant
canines
and
passing
the
who
had
rallied
the
stable
men
and
was
in
hot
pursuit
somebody
turned
out
turned
out
he
shouted
and
swept
profanely
by
the
gate
of
the
stood
open
a
familiar
figure
running
low
paused
and
then
sprinted
nimbly
along
the
paddock
fence
a
white
sweater
was
distinguishable
for
a
moment
on
a
stone
wall
then
it
followed
a
pair
of
enchanted
heels
into
oblivion
time
had
been
passing
swiftly
and
the
shadows
were
deepening
i
retraced
my
steps
toward
the
terrace
hearing
the
cries
of
pursued
and
pursuers
growing
fainter
i
had
not
yet
gained
a
position
from
which
i
could
see
cecilia
when
a
man
appeared
some
distance
ahead
of
me
walking
guardedly
in
one
of
the
he
came
uncertainly
pausing
to
glance
about
yet
evidently
led
toward
the
terrace
by
a
definite
purpose
all
may
be
fair
in
love
and
war
but
i
confess
to
a
feeling
of
pity
for
john
stewart
dick
as
i
watched
him
slowly
advancing
to
his
fate
he
was
going
boldly
now
and
i
felt
a
sudden
liking
for
him
nor
can
i
believe
that
he
was
other
than
a
manly
fellow
with
sound
brains
and
a
good
heart
i
reasoned
as
i
marked
his
approach
to
the
terrace
that
he
had
been
loitering
in
the
neighborhood
probably
watching
cecilia
and
pepperton
and
when
the
architect
retired
he
had
assumed
that
the
sixth
man
had
spoken
the
appearance
of
his
former
comrades
of
the
inn
had
doubtless
disturbed
him
as
it
had
me
then
thanks
to
the
resourceful
hezekiah
they
had
been
routed
and
the
coast
was
clear
i
think
it
likely
that
the
sight
of
cecilia
sombrely
pacing
the
terrace
in
the
darkening

much
for
his

poise
or
like
the
rest
of
us
who
were
actors
in
that
comedy
he
may
have
felt
that
any
end
was
better
than
the
doubts
and
uncertainties
that
beset
us
i
watched
him
draw
nearer
to
cecilia
as
i
have
watched
deer
go
down
to
a
lake
to
drink
he
would
speak
now
i
was
confident
of
it
and
i
stole
round
to
the
side
entrance
and
sent
word
to
wiggins
to
go
to
the
and
wait
for
me
miss
octavia
and
pepperton
still
lingered
over
their
the
row
made
by
the
fugitives
from
her
kennels
had
not
it
seemed
penetrated
to
the
library
and
miss
octavia
bade
me
join
the
talk
which
had
to
do
i
remember
with
some
project
for
a
national
hall
of
fame
that
had
incurred
her
characteristic
displeasure
a
hall
of
immortal
rascals
in
pillories
she
thought
far
likelier
to
please
the
masses
in
fifteen
minutes
i
saw
cecilia
crossing
the
hall
she
stopped
where
i
could
see
her
quite
plainly
and
thrust
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
coat
out
flashed
the
silver
she
made
a
swift
notation
with
the
pencil
that
now
i
knew
wrote
the
fate
of
the
sixth
man
i
went
out
and
spoke
to
her
and
walked
beside
her
to
the
door
where
hartley
wiggins
was
waiting
miss
octavia
had
risen
when
i
returned
to
the
library
and
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
just
a
moment
miss
hollister
something
of
great
interest
is
about
to
occur
and
i
made
excuses
for
detaining
her
for
perhaps
five
minutes
not
more
you
have
never
yet
deceived
me
arnold
ames
and
such
is
my
confidence
in
you
that
if
you
tell
me
that
something
interesting
will
soon
occur
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
you
it
is
worth
remembering
however
that
fowl
is
not
improved
by
prolonged
roasting
i
heard
wiggins
laugh
in
the
hall
and
miss
octavia
raised
her
head
then
cecilia
came
into
the
room
and
walked
directly
to
her
aunt
aunt
octavia
here
is
the
little
silver
notebook
you
gave
me
in
paris
i
have
just
written
wiggins
name
in
it
and
as
i
have
no
further
use
for
the
book
i
return
it
with
my
love
and
thanks
without
a
word
miss
octavia
turned
to
the
wall
and
pressed
the
button
twice
william
she
said
as
the
butler
appeared
you
may
serve
oriana
and
be
careful
not
to
freeze
it
to
death
and
the
hour
for

yourself

they
dine
with
me
hezekiah
and
i
built
our
bungalow
in
the
orchard
where
on
that
october
afternoon
i
found
her
munching
a
red
apple
on
the
stone
wall
she
is
the
most
scrupulous
of
housewives
and
only
now
took
me
to
task
for
scattering
the
hearth
with
fragments
of
the
notes
from
which
this
narrative
has
been
written
she
has
just
been
reading
these
last
pages
with
meditative
brown
eyes
and
not
without
occasionally
reaching
for
the
pen
and
retouching
some
sentence
in
which
she
says

from
my
days

clogged

ink

adventures
to
which
they
are

inclined

every

still
owns
it

makes
money
out
of
it
though
she
rarely
goes
there

sends
freda

maid

collect
the
profits

it

do
any

say
that
when

met
you
there

she
